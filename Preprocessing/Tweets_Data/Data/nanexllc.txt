nanexllc	705246797283905536	2016-03-03T04:21:53	kasey_junk What's in it for me?
nanexllc	705246600575242246	2016-03-03T04:21:07	kasey_junk *Illegal* latency arbitrage. FTFY
nanexllc	705246004950507521	2016-03-03T04:18:45	kasey_junk OK, great. Then help me push for regulatory compliance of the SIP. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good
nanexllc	705245598606336000	2016-03-03T04:17:08	kasey_junk With all due respect, who gives a fuck about latency arbitrage if the system is regulatory compliant?
nanexllc	705245267554123776	2016-03-03T04:15:49	kasey_junk It's hard to do that when you keep getting side tracked. Just admit that regulatory compliance of the SIP IS possible
nanexllc	705245076235145216	2016-03-03T04:15:03	kasey_junk There is no regulatory requirement to appease folks. Some folks get pissed when others are "appeased" outside of Regs.
nanexllc	705244783355273216	2016-03-03T04:13:53	kasey_junk There is only 1 topic and that is regulatory compliance of the SIP. Everything else is classified (I'm not sharing any IP)
nanexllc	705244445730598914	2016-03-03T04:12:33	kasey_junk That's not how regulations work. If regulatory compliance is impossible, exchanges need to submit proposals to change Regs.
nanexllc	705243479157444609	2016-03-03T04:08:42	kasey_junk Simple yes/no: are your concerns about "ideal SIP" or "regulatory compliant SIP"?
nanexllc	705242989614989312	2016-03-03T04:06:46	kasey_junk Bad Actors? I must have missed some jump in our conversation about "acks". Oh, do you mean bad "acks"? What are those?
nanexllc	705242511116267520	2016-03-03T04:04:52	kasey_junk About 20 years ago, I developed and released loss-less form of multicast. If I can do it, pretty sure exchanges can too
nanexllc	705241770825785344	2016-03-03T04:01:55	kasey_junk I'm fairly confident that order books have many more inconsistent state problems from a dropped packet than the SIP
nanexllc	705241429296214016	2016-03-03T04:00:34	kasey_junk I've worked with many multicast direct feeds since 1985. There is no waiting in any of them. Ever.
nanexllc	705241021853147137	2016-03-03T03:58:57	kasey_junk OK, but that is a different topic right? It's not a topic I have EVER discussed in 3,000+ pages. EVER. I want to be clear
nanexllc	705240793938788352	2016-03-03T03:58:02	kasey_junk How about 99.9% of the time?
nanexllc	705240536697937920	2016-03-03T03:57:01	kasey_junk UDP doesn't care about "acks"
nanexllc	705239241719160833	2016-03-03T03:51:52	kasey_junk IEX notwithstanding
nanexllc	705239189298741248	2016-03-03T03:51:40	kasey_junk Really? You can't think of how one could ensure the SIP reasonably receives data at the same time as a direct feed recipient?
nanexllc	705238049316327424	2016-03-03T03:47:08	kasey_junk Excellent. To be clear, I believe the SIP should follow Reg NMS, no more. I've never stated nor implied otherwise in any post
nanexllc	705236696795901952	2016-03-03T03:41:45	kasey_junk Excellent. Thank you. Designing an ideal SIP is quite a bit different than designing one that follows Reg NMS. Agree?
nanexllc	705235107737681920	2016-03-03T03:35:26	kasey_junk Ditto - I have no business relationship with IEX. What name did you use in comments on my Hacker News post?

nanexllc	705231409783422976	2016-03-03T03:20:45	kasey_junk I would stop using TCP w/ nagle enabled and ensure the SIP receives the data before direct feed. You know, Reg NMS

nanexllc	704855618864152580	2016-03-02T02:27:29	BahitJolaman Cabbies was your suggestion. Need a mirror?
nanexllc	704855245856362496	2016-03-02T02:26:00	BahitJolaman Please take me out of further correspondence. Thank you.

nanexllc	704854518085844993	2016-03-02T02:23:07	YoungMoneyBull ReformedBroker You ever see a network diagram of U.S. Stock market? Take a look and then talk to me about efficiency
nanexllc	704854158231396352	2016-03-02T02:21:41	Stevephenni But I am a stock bull!
nanexllc	704853978476101632	2016-03-02T02:20:58	KeeblerElf3 That's why I recommend (except in thin stocks) - small market orders. They fair the best according to 605 reports
nanexllc	704853773366259713	2016-03-02T02:20:09	You begin at the beginning. Everyone does their part. We call that sort of thing a "Society"

nanexllc	704846080308092928	2016-03-02T01:49:35	BahitJolaman KenGermanicus Whose money do you think Institutions invest?
nanexllc	704844955056009217	2016-03-02T01:45:07	SEC to pay nanexllc $750K whistleblower award for 2012 NYSE fine:  Reuters
nanexllc	704844813108178944	2016-03-02T01:44:33	nanexllc ReformedBroker How pathetic 4 anybody to say "it's always been rigged. Get over it." Part of the problem. 
nanexllc	704843520331239424	2016-03-02T01:39:25	BahitJolaman It makes nothing to you &amp; I. But it is a felony theft on the millions of Americans who own 401ks, pension plans etc nanexllc
nanexllc	704844322861150208	2016-03-02T01:42:36	BahitJolaman KenGermanicus That's the discussion. Theft. To the tune of $100M/year. That's why NYSE was fined.
nanexllc	704844022947438593	2016-03-02T01:41:25	choke_puppy The Goldman people beat you to it.
nanexllc	704842272861368320	2016-03-02T01:34:27	Stevephenni nanexllc TheArmoTrader I wouldn't care if investors knew the truth and didn't change behavior. But that isn't the case here.
nanexllc	704842107798683649	2016-03-02T01:33:48	nanexllc arjewelpartners ReformedBroker  simple, his FEES depend on the market operating, not disrupting it. So much for being "reformed"
nanexllc	704843321043189761	2016-03-02T01:38:37	zh_crown Not frustrated at all. See my happy avatar! This is both work (advancing rock) and entertainment (being on the right side)
nanexllc	704842917836226560	2016-03-02T01:37:01	BahitJolaman  The institutions are the hundreds of billion of American working people's wages/salaries invested in their 401k nanexllc
nanexllc	704842596649213953	2016-03-02T01:35:45	BahitJolaman Again, theft is theft. Doesn't cost you directly, but it costs society. We don't advance as fast with thieves in the system
nanexllc	704842185733226496	2016-03-02T01:34:07	zh_crown The reason I've gotten the rock this high up the hill is from being relentless, one at a time.
nanexllc	704841518142586880	2016-03-02T01:31:27	choke_puppy And it was the $750K that got me on, not the $100M/yr theft. Go figure
nanexllc	704840012890824706	2016-03-02T01:25:29	.nanexllc Congrats on the reward. Saw the interview this AM. Shouldn't have taken an award to get CNBC to report the news

nanexllc	704840174950285312	2016-03-02T01:26:07	nanexllc zomgjon I read book Demon of Our Own Design back in 2007. If you're willing to think around computers you can profit.
nanexllc	704840602635083781	2016-03-02T01:27:49	BahitJolaman KenGermanicus Theft is still theft.
nanexllc	704840405771227136	2016-03-02T01:27:02	joemuoio ReformedBroker nanexllc Can't sue the exchanges. They kept their legal immunity when they became for-profit. That's the conflict
nanexllc	704837836701310976	2016-03-02T01:16:50	nanexllc The idea is to make cheating, swindling, scamming as HARD as possible. Not as EASY.  Yeah, subtle point there.
