Noahpinion	714676958769111042	2016-03-29T04:53:59	7/Sixth, there is no institutionalized way to shrink research fields that run out of new things to discover (anthro? high-energy physics?).
Noahpinion	714676846047182848	2016-03-29T04:53:32	6/Fifth, tenure might be selecting a professoriate too risk-averse to make big new disoveries: 
Noahpinion	714676758407168000	2016-03-29T04:53:11	5/Fourth, shrinking productivity is a worry, given rising administrative costs whose benefits are unclear: 
Noahpinion	714676559030910976	2016-03-29T04:52:24	4/Third, there is a huge rich/poor gap in who applies to top colleges, which hurts equality of opportunity. This has proven hard to fix.

Noahpinion	714676406068908032	2016-03-29T04:51:47	2/First, of course, is the huge and crushing burden of student loans, which many students seem to take on due to short-sightedness.

Noahpinion	714661905441357824	2016-03-29T03:54:10	balajis mims Definitely! :-)
Noahpinion	714661690189725697	2016-03-29T03:53:19	balajis There's a lot of interesting math here. Sometimes *less* choice is better overall, sometimes more.

Noahpinion	714660239845552129	2016-03-29T03:47:33	balajis mims Tiebout fails in general because of preference heterogeneity. You don't need limits on mobility or sorting for it to fail.
Noahpinion	714659985221922817	2016-03-29T03:46:32	balajis mims You keep focusing on moving costs, but Bewley already assumes those are 0.

Noahpinion	714658258099810305	2016-03-29T03:39:41	balajis mims Also, I strongly suspect that in the real world, "crowdchoice" is just herd behavior/social learning.
Noahpinion	714657692644540417	2016-03-29T03:37:26	balajis mims Check out the list of reasons Tiebout fails, and you see lots of things that smartphones will probably *increase*.
Noahpinion	714657059610841088	2016-03-29T03:34:55	balajis mims This website gets basic econ 101 supply and demand curves totally and utterly wrong! I am not happy about it. :-(
Noahpinion	714656163959189504	2016-03-29T03:31:21	balajis mims But if smartphones increase network externalities and make tastes more heterogeneous, they make Tiebout worse, not better.
Noahpinion	714655901831995392	2016-03-29T03:30:19	balajis mims Is "crowdchoice" a magic word that can solve the prisoner's dilemma? If so, well, we've assumed a solution! :-)
Noahpinion	714655619941158912	2016-03-29T03:29:12	balajis mims You can reject self-interested individual rationality, sure. Many do. But what formal model can replace that?
Noahpinion	714655185834868736	2016-03-29T03:27:28	balajis mims Bewley result doesn't depend on general equilibrium, just Nash.
Noahpinion	714653007137214464	2016-03-29T03:18:49	balajis mims Actually, these abilities may make Tiebout sorting *less* efficient.
Noahpinion	714652684251336704	2016-03-29T03:17:32	balajis mims Obviously only you can decide what persuades you, but I think phones clearly don't solve any of the problems Bewley raises.
Noahpinion	714652322551345152	2016-03-29T03:16:05	balajis mims Bewley's paper grants perfect info/mobility and still finds Tiebout inefficient in general.
Noahpinion	714651404736987136	2016-03-29T03:12:27	Hmm, looks like Japanese marketers are going for the American college student market... ;-)

Noahpinion	714649523935547392	2016-03-29T03:04:58	balajis mims Bewley finds sufficient conditions for Tiebout to work, but they go well beyond perfect information and mobility.
Noahpinion	714649286378520576	2016-03-29T03:04:02	balajis mims Tiebout doesn't fail in Bewley's paper b/c of limits to information or mobility, but for more complicated reasons.
Noahpinion	714634777144401922	2016-03-29T02:06:22	balajis mims FYI, economists have modeled that out, and it usually doesn't work.

Noahpinion	713005519414251520	2016-03-24T14:12:17	tucker_doherty Sure.
Noahpinion	713004461912752128	2016-03-24T14:08:05	kocherlakota009 Sure. But in the meantime, since Fed can't control Congress, why not try helicopter money? Fun policy experiment!
Noahpinion	713004299618390016	2016-03-24T14:07:26	tucker_doherty One would assume that petty crimes would be *more* likely to be economically motivated. Drug sales, theft, etc.
Noahpinion	713004133746221056	2016-03-24T14:06:47	tucker_doherty No idea, but inclusion of non-serious crimes males the flat distribution far more startling.

Noahpinion	712392556525461504	2016-03-22T21:36:35	The point of publicizing the fact that a trade deficit is a loan is to get people to think about the intertemporal choice aspect of trade.

Noahpinion	712346619379757056	2016-03-22T18:34:03	Exactly. Free traders have been reduced to claiming that we get our daily bread from the benevolence of the baker.

Noahpinion	712337717112086528	2016-03-22T17:58:41	johnbellessa Incentives for saving, and export subsidies, are two things I can think of. If we in fact *want* to stop trade deficits.
Noahpinion	712337381647450112	2016-03-22T17:57:21	dandolfa That is an interesting case. Are we mis-accounting for the real value of financial services we provide to foreigners?
Noahpinion	712335451441369088	2016-03-22T17:49:40	dandolfa Sure.

Noahpinion	712330898922844160	2016-03-22T17:31:35	snlester You're still just thinking financially. Try to think in terms of real goods/services.

Noahpinion	710915956562722816	2016-03-18T19:49:06	kevin_bowen harpojaeger All dumb plodding robo-libertarians should read MattBruenig explain why property rights = coercion.
Noahpinion	710914452728578048	2016-03-18T19:43:08	JamesBSherk ?? I tried to get that across. But the key point is that efficiency wage theory doesn't say wage *hikes* are OK.
Noahpinion	710913817211842560	2016-03-18T19:40:36	JohnJSSoriano Interesting idea, haven't seen that.
Noahpinion	710913755324887040	2016-03-18T19:40:22	Actually, yes!  
Noahpinion	710912496773640193	2016-03-18T19:35:22	JohnJSSoriano But if we fail to raise minwage and people experience shitty life conditions as a result, that is also bad.
Noahpinion	710911822908383232	2016-03-18T19:32:41	JohnJSSoriano Sure could.
Noahpinion	710911777588977664	2016-03-18T19:32:30	kevin_bowen Of course. Epidemiology, for example. Public sanitation was just such an experiment.
Noahpinion	710911439326748674	2016-03-18T19:31:09	blub_29 kevin_bowen I believe that is in fact what Kevin just suggested! (Note: I get Kevin's video games.)
Noahpinion	710911276851924992	2016-03-18T19:30:31	kevin_bowen Ending all state intervention is also a policy experiment. A huge one, in fact.
Noahpinion	710911121113292800	2016-03-18T19:29:54	.kevin_bowen Perhaps we could have some kind of system where people choose the leaders who decide which policy experiments to perform!
Noahpinion	710910913587458048	2016-03-18T19:29:04	Mark_R_Adams SteveCase Of course it is, but who votes and lobbies for zoning?
Noahpinion	710910789251534848	2016-03-18T19:28:34	.salimfurth So we should avoid appearing to change the minimum wage because people tend to dislike the appearance of change?

Noahpinion	709133657278009345	2016-03-13T21:46:53	Changing demographics are perceived as a threat to white privilege, just as the middle class has eroded dramatically.
Noahpinion	709133395071082496	2016-03-13T21:45:51	Bouie's theory, basically, is that some % of whites believe that white privilege is their main ticket to the American middle class.

Noahpinion	709123665472802816	2016-03-13T21:07:11	16/But switching to measures other than p-values is *highly* unlikely to reduce the tendency for overhype. (end)
Noahpinion	709123606979039233	2016-03-13T21:06:57	15/A final problem is the overhyping of scientific results. This also argues for stronger filters for publication purposes.
Noahpinion	709123543884128256	2016-03-13T21:06:42	14/So traders probably shouldn't use p-values at all, but some likelihood-based measure. Which, AFAIK, they all do in fact use.
Noahpinion	709123475936415744	2016-03-13T21:06:26	13/Trading is different. Traders worry a lot about false negatives (missing out) as well as false positives.
Noahpinion	709123402632564736	2016-03-13T21:06:08	12/So in academic quant finance we should heed camharvey's call and demand lower p-values for publication.
Noahpinion	709123326845661184	2016-03-13T21:05:50	11/2 reasons for this: 1) you may need to trade on a result, and 2) "laws" of finance often stable only for a moderate amount of time.
Noahpinion	709123266959384576	2016-03-13T21:05:36	10/Quant finance, however, is different than natural science. In quant finance, you often need to get a result right *the first time*.
Noahpinion	709123190757298177	2016-03-13T21:05:18	9/So it makes sense, if you see a lot of crap results getting published, to demand lower p-values for publication. "Stronger filter".
Noahpinion	709123104082042880	2016-03-13T21:04:57	8/Of course, you might still want to prevent information overload - a bunch of spurious published results. E.g.: 
Noahpinion	709123012943937536	2016-03-13T21:04:35	7/If the "laws" of nature are pretty constant, replication will eventually zero in on the truth. Science is a slow but inexorable process.
Noahpinion	709122875119108097	2016-03-13T21:04:02	6/In science, "more filters" means replication. Do multiple experiments. Have multiple researchers reconfirm the hypothesis. Etc.
Noahpinion	709122797444816896	2016-03-13T21:03:44	5/Option 1: You can make your filter stronger. Option 2: You can run each hypothesis through more filters before you believe it.
Noahpinion	709122605576421376	2016-03-13T21:02:58	4/If you're worried about false positives - crappy hypotheses getting through the filter - you have two basic options to prevent this.
Noahpinion	709122537179877376	2016-03-13T21:02:42	3/Forget what a p-value really means. It's just a filter. Hypotheses that match the data better will get through the filter. That's all.
Noahpinion	709122468544274433	2016-03-13T21:02:26	2/I think this criticism, while appropriate for some domains and applications, is in general way overdone. P-values ain't so bad at all.
Noahpinion	709122357634289665	2016-03-13T21:01:59	1/A lot of people have been complaining about p-values. For example, the American Statistical Association statement: 
Noahpinion	709117920647847936	2016-03-13T20:44:21	trengriffin dandolfa farmerrf Definitions are not, by themselves, predictive of anything.

Noahpinion	708730383433478144	2016-03-12T19:04:25	camharvey igo1425 But in physics, where the laws never change, no one complains about p-values, and with good reason...
