boes_	715309057968627712	2016-03-30T22:45:43	econhedge georgepearkes barnejek yeah and stronger in CPI if I remember right...however, not sure you can make the same case for apparel

boes_	714932479447187456	2016-03-29T21:49:20	Emergingtrends barnejek yep and they took great care to make sure it was, in a way that was opposite of disruptive
boes_	714928424670859265	2016-03-29T21:33:13	Emergingtrends barnejek seriously when has she ever let anyone make money betting on a hawkish Fed surprise?

boes_	714925570354769920	2016-03-29T21:21:53	barnejek Emergingtrends reminds me of how Williams and Lockhart said after Oct. FOMC the intent was to move front contract a few bps
boes_	714925072247627777	2016-03-29T21:19:54	Emergingtrends I mean really her point is they don't feel the need to front-run the front end, so by definition hikes won't be disruptive
boes_	714924850125647872	2016-03-29T21:19:01	Emergingtrends but aren't we really just talking about a few basis points in the front end? How would that be disruptive
boes_	714920728731234305	2016-03-29T21:02:38	Emergingtrends wait, didn't you see how she not only validated market pricing of Fed but also credited it for supporting the economy?

boes_	687032049539112960	2016-01-12T22:02:59	dandolfa I see it the other way around as RRP effectively removes both reserves and other HQLA from the system...

boes_	687027351989923840	2016-01-12T21:44:19	dandolfa that's what I mean, the MMFs receiving collateral in o/n RRPs with the Fed wouldn't be the ones buying in outright sales
boes_	687026674135920643	2016-01-12T21:41:38	dandolfa (a) the tri-party system and more importantly (b) the agents receiving the collateral have no use for re-use
boes_	687025289822662661	2016-01-12T21:36:08	dandolfa I guess, but MMFs aren't the ones who sold the USTs to the Fed 
boes_	687022199912443910	2016-01-12T21:23:51	dandolfa banks lose deposits to MMFs, which place the cash at the Fed
boes_	687021348347113472	2016-01-12T21:20:28	dandolfa for starters, Basel created demand for HQLA to satisfy regs and RRP potentially removes a bunch of it from the market, locks it up
boes_	687020170515247105	2016-01-12T21:15:47	dr_nrl dandolfa in the past Fed bought assets to replace reserves lost via growth of currency in circulation
boes_	687018075661725698	2016-01-12T21:07:28	dandolfa ah disagree because with outright sales, market gets to use the collateral however it likes whereas RRP locks it all up at the Fed
boes_	687016780158627840	2016-01-12T21:02:19	dandolfa love that chart...Fed drained ~$120B of reserves from the banking system in 2015 through passive accommodation of currency growth

boes_	686980732623949824	2016-01-12T18:39:04	naufalsanaullah dandolfa could've just not hiked in those two instances?
boes_	686980135233433601	2016-01-12T18:36:42	naufalsanaullah dandolfa what's this have to do with the May 2000 and June 2006 hikes and curve inversions?
boes_	686977413146873857	2016-01-12T18:25:53	dandolfa but bond market clearly wasn't concerned about inflation in either case
boes_	686977148238852096	2016-01-12T18:24:50	dandolfa maybe...core PCE inflation was 1.6% right before final 2000 hike, and 2.2% right before final 2006 hike
boes_	686975408894513152	2016-01-12T18:17:55	dandolfa why do you suppose Fed figured curve inversion was a good idea in 2000 and again in 2006?
