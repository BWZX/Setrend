groditi	707386438015320065	2016-03-09T02:04:04	What's the issue, they can't get an advance facility on their residuals or a warehouse for their loan production from a money center bank?
groditi	707385520813256704	2016-03-09T02:00:25	I'm really baffled as to why they would need a HF to bring in funding. How will this be better than warehouse + securitization?

groditi	693180853065658368	2016-01-29T21:16:08	JakeCahan yeah that's my concern, because the income stream has such a short WAL that topline can easily halve in like 12 months
groditi	693180520809652225	2016-01-29T21:14:49	JakeCahan those are going to become a CFPB issue at some point
groditi	693179588252299264	2016-01-29T21:11:07	JakeCahan it's just like mtg servicing for dq loans. tons and tons of call center type labor. dunno where margin goes except def lower
groditi	693179375013892096	2016-01-29T21:10:16	JakeCahan i think for the whole space there's too much focus on basis point moves in NCOs when ppl should be watching servicing expenses
groditi	693179178921791488	2016-01-29T21:09:29	JakeCahan but i think the business can survive in it's current incarnation. you gotta remember nonprime lending is very high-touch service
groditi	693178904169705473	2016-01-29T21:08:24	JakeCahan margins hi right now, should compress. ~2y WAL assets we're not going back to 2009-2010 APRs or to 2012 NCO rates anytime soon

groditi	693171397485420544	2016-01-29T20:38:34	JakeCahan so like for me i would think the valuation model is closer to say a mortgage servicer than a bank or ABS-funded nonbank lender
groditi	693171099010347008	2016-01-29T20:37:23	JakeCahan biz run very well by highly capable people but the price is way too high for someone doing things the CFPB is going after
groditi	693170856625700866	2016-01-29T20:36:25	JakeCahan because that fee can halt very quickly if consumers pay off or refi or default. their underwritting model is amazing tho
groditi	693170634130522112	2016-01-29T20:35:32	JakeCahan i think you need to look at it from an earnings basis on stable volumees and transition fee and then shock it

groditi	692204857139265538	2016-01-27T04:37:53	Nonrelatedsense adoxen I think we need an (unknown) net minimum of active to maximize agg returns. Mkt is testing that boundary now
groditi	692204630768537602	2016-01-27T04:36:59	Nonrelatedsense adoxen are we talking about aggregate returns or index returns, that matters and also is limited by price discovery

groditi	688173998010568704	2016-01-16T01:40:41	DavidSchawel munilass yea but that fantasy scenario is not happening. As I've said repeatedly short-interest data disproves it
groditi	688173764127764481	2016-01-16T01:39:45	DavidSchawel munilass false because there is no cash buy creation, shares are created and redeemed in kind

groditi	688170428683030528	2016-01-16T01:26:30	DavidSchawel munilass there is *never* "net new demand". Even if long initiated creation someone would need to sell shares to prime/AP
groditi	688169707753492480	2016-01-16T01:23:38	DavidSchawel munilass short-interest data says that's false.
groditi	688165625194102785	2016-01-16T01:07:25	DavidSchawel munilass regardless of who called the AP, every share count increase ultimately necessitated a simultaneous share buyer
groditi	688165245513154562	2016-01-16T01:05:54	DavidSchawel munilass the creation process could be initiated by *anyone* but it requires a corresponding buyer from any short initiator
groditi	688164863407820803	2016-01-16T01:04:23	DavidSchawel munilass r u high? This the creation mechanism that delivers a share for seller to sell, not a magic short entry into acct
groditi	688163082074374146	2016-01-16T00:57:18	DavidSchawel munilass yeah and what market makers just keep the long side in balance sheet and eat the delta risk? You believe that?
groditi	688162741874327552	2016-01-16T00:55:57	BarbarianCap DavidSchawel munilass well it's wrong and all you'd needy see it is to understand basic mechanics + short-interest data
groditi	688162093233602560	2016-01-16T00:53:23	DavidSchawel munilass just think it through. There can't be short-driven creation without corresponding and preceding long demand
groditi	688161823908995072	2016-01-16T00:52:18	DavidSchawel munilass it's wrong. The mechanics don't work, it's a fantasy and if you actually believe that nonsense you must need a nap
groditi	688161044460486656	2016-01-16T00:49:13	DavidSchawel munilass even if share creation was initiated by a prime for shorts the bank would have to hedge or (more likely) sell shares
groditi	688160740377673728	2016-01-16T00:48:00	DavidSchawel munilass no this is a fallacy that people keep bringing up and is not real because someone would have to be on the long side.
