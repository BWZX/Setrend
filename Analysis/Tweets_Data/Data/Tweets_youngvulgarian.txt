youngvulgarian	723564319431098368	2016-04-22T17:29:11	DuncanWeldon Well it's been in the fridge since I got home at lunch, so hopefully will be okay...?

youngvulgarian	723563894250283008	2016-04-22T17:27:30	DuncanWeldon Duncan do you think I need to eat the trout tonight or can it hold til tomorrow?

youngvulgarian	722697869078216704	2016-04-20T08:06:13	joncstone edjeff kadhimshubber I'm not saying the Sun wouldn't have done it regardless, but it would have made their story flimsier
youngvulgarian	722697269846351872	2016-04-20T08:03:50	edjeff kadhimshubber yeah but it's politics, you have to explain everything you do if you want to avoid (wilful) misinterpretations
youngvulgarian	722696683293908992	2016-04-20T08:01:31	kadhimshubber yeah and they wouldn't have been able to use the snobby middle class angle if reasons had been clar from the outset
youngvulgarian	722695921595740162	2016-04-20T07:58:29	guess who's back, back again Rusbri's back, tell a friend   
youngvulgarian	722695202272632832	2016-04-20T07:55:37	kadhimshubber not necessarily just tabloids, mostly rightish Labour MPs calling him snobby for his decision
youngvulgarian	722694593255489536	2016-04-20T07:53:12	kadhimshubber They should have released a statement explaining why they did it straight away, would have nipped bad stories in the bud.
youngvulgarian	722694280398114816	2016-04-20T07:51:58	kadhimshubber  I don't think it's a bad idea as such, it's just been handled so badly that they've once again shot themselves in the foot
youngvulgarian	722691033218342912	2016-04-20T07:39:03	AbiWilks stephenkb yeah, workfare + generally having attracted headlines for its dodgy behaviour over the past few years
youngvulgarian	722690732113412097	2016-04-20T07:37:52	Nick_Pettigrew AbiWilks Nah. If you're going to do something you think may end up being high profile, you explain why you're doing it.
youngvulgarian	722689578126221312	2016-04-20T07:33:17	AbiWilks like most things Corbyn has done so far, I don't think it's a fundamentally bad idea, it's just been handled badly
youngvulgarian	722688772064866304	2016-04-20T07:30:04	AbiWilks Yeah, that's fair - I don't mind what they do either way tbh - but the McD thing can't be kept in a vacuum, is what I meant.
youngvulgarian	722688578975854592	2016-04-20T07:29:18	jackrjthompson Nah, I find that argument a bit shaky tbh - Corbyn was talking about the corporation, not McDonald's as a product.
youngvulgarian	722688171520221185	2016-04-20T07:27:41	Nick_Pettigrew Look at what I tweeted afterwards - I don't think this addresses the issue.
youngvulgarian	722687803604234241	2016-04-20T07:26:13	Labour's just opened itself up to about a hundred "so McDonald's isn't good enough for Labour but how about [x]?" headlines, basically.
youngvulgarian	722687586146336768	2016-04-20T07:25:22	As aljwhite has pointed out, G4S provides security for Labour conference. Surely they're "worse" than McD. Where's the line?
youngvulgarian	722687402960121856	2016-04-20T07:24:38	Right, so I don't necessarily have a problem with Corbyn banning McDonald's as such, but then who else will be banned from having a stall?
youngvulgarian	722683880617152513	2016-04-20T07:10:38	"She doesn't condone ISIS but asks the reader to consider Islamic State's effective use of social media and video" is a sentence I just read

youngvulgarian	715196324761759744	2016-03-30T15:17:46	Having a look at the latest roll of pictures I've taken and I think I'm getting...reasonably good at it? 
youngvulgarian	715187657039593472	2016-03-30T14:43:19	Results to this - whatever they are - will be fascinating.

youngvulgarian	715185199190040580	2016-03-30T14:33:33	Sajid Javid didn't even have time to recharge his kindle so he's now reading every article in the in-flight magazine
youngvulgarian	715184527853953025	2016-03-30T14:30:53	ByRobDavies well I changed the format of the joke but it was still the same joke at heart, yes
youngvulgarian	715184219228610560	2016-03-30T14:29:40	Oh this is delicious: 'Paul Dacre Claimed £60,000 In EU Subsidies For His Scottish Estate'

youngvulgarian	715183633548623872	2016-03-30T14:27:20	ByRobDavies I am about to sort of steal this joke and I apologise in advance
youngvulgarian	715183287631814656	2016-03-30T14:25:57	Is there any way someone could elaborately troll Javid by telling him that after the steel debate he has to fly straight back to Australia?
youngvulgarian	715183086749790208	2016-03-30T14:25:09	hansmollman yes I know but it';s still a legitimate question
youngvulgarian	715182799226073089	2016-03-30T14:24:01	Sajid Javid watched all the good films on his first flight so now he's stuck with Horrrible Bosses 2 and Transendence for the return journey
youngvulgarian	715182608834043904	2016-03-30T14:23:16	hansmollman and will he be double jet lagged or not jet lagged at all
youngvulgarian	715181598921064448	2016-03-30T14:19:15	Will Sajid Javid be double jetlagged or not jetlagged at all because the two flights cancel each other out?
youngvulgarian	715181338316390400	2016-03-30T14:18:13	hansmollman fair tbh
youngvulgarian	715180440064278528	2016-03-30T14:14:38	Would watch a short sitcom of Sajid Javid spending 21 hours on a plane to Australia, spending basically no time there &amp; having to fly back.

youngvulgarian	714775139360108544	2016-03-29T11:24:07	DavidMills73 PCollinsTimes Agreed, but there's no way in hell anyone not from Corbyn's side of the party can get the membership back on

youngvulgarian	712940953540116481	2016-03-24T09:55:43	Neera_jah See next tweet, my phrasing was bad: I disagree with the motion, but think the general issue should be addressed.
youngvulgarian	712939893765365760	2016-03-24T09:51:31	Talked to Jacob Rees-Mogg's office about Tracey Emin marrying a rock for the StandardDiary, because why not: 
youngvulgarian	712938798502514688	2016-03-24T09:47:09	[and again] 
youngvulgarian	712938176738893824	2016-03-24T09:44:41	piercepenniless Yeah, tweeted again to clarify - motion's bullshit, obv, but it could/should be the start of a general conversation...
youngvulgarian	712936769772261376	2016-03-24T09:39:06	theguyliner Yes, agreed!
youngvulgarian	712936666156122112	2016-03-24T09:38:41	theguyliner Oh no, that motion was pretty trash, obv, but I do think there's a more general point to be made about the issue, basically
youngvulgarian	712936201280438273	2016-03-24T09:36:50	journodave CAN WE HAVE A FIST FIGHT* *(yes, looking forward to talk about it IRL, and as I told J, happy to be proved wrong!)
youngvulgarian	712935952000425984	2016-03-24T09:35:51	theguyliner Agreed, but it's also not unreasonable to say that cis gay men are overrepresented within the LGBT community...?
youngvulgarian	712934928036528129	2016-03-24T09:31:47	journodave as we said with James, prob not the best chat to have on Twitter but this sums up my position, basically 
youngvulgarian	712934379228635136	2016-03-24T09:29:36	jamesrbuk Let's talk about it IRL soon - happy to be proved wrong. Also look at the piece I've just tweeted re. where I currently stand...
youngvulgarian	712934124533780480	2016-03-24T09:28:35	This is really good &amp; feels relevant, by shonfaye:  
youngvulgarian	712933431701807106	2016-03-24T09:25:50	Dobbln but it can be useful to acknowledge the fact cis gay men do overall have it easier than the rest of the LGBT community...?
youngvulgarian	712933131855261696	2016-03-24T09:24:38	journodave anymore is bullshit, but they are still in a relative place of privilege compared to other LGBT people...
youngvulgarian	712933053233041409	2016-03-24T09:24:20	journodave transphobic as anyone else? like I think that motion was kinda trash and obviously saying that cis gay men face no issues
youngvulgarian	712932865659559936	2016-03-24T09:23:35	journodave surely you can't deny that a) cis gay men are overrepresented when talking about LGBT struggles b) they can be as misogynistic/
