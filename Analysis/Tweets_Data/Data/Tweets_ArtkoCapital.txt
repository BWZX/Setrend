ArtkoCapital	701808957187354625	2016-02-22T16:41:09	FirstService Corp historical revenues 
ArtkoCapital	700762983228530688	2016-02-19T19:24:49	It's not a big position for us but a pretty good long term option.
ArtkoCapital	700762819231293440	2016-02-19T19:24:10	But you're not paying for upside that Dan Lee can create. He can easily double that PF EBITDA in 12 months.
ArtkoCapital	700762591023362048	2016-02-19T19:23:15	19mm shares outstanding at $1.40 or MV of $27mm. PF EV at $110-115 vs $23mm in EBITDA or 4.5x-5x EV/EBITDA which is cheap-ish given leverage
ArtkoCapital	700762032941830144	2016-02-19T19:21:02	Not the best number w PF EBITDA of $23ish but at 3.5x manageable.
ArtkoCapital	700761841593495553	2016-02-19T19:20:17	No BS numbers yet but 3q debt was $74mm and cash was $14.  Add prob $2-3mm in 4q and $30mm of EV for BB acquisition. Net debt appx $85ish
ArtkoCapital	700761091081547776	2016-02-19T19:17:18	We would expect that '16 should be close to $17-$18 ex Bronco Billy's acquisition which should add $5.1 annual but prob $3.5-$4 for '16
ArtkoCapital	700760595805515777	2016-02-19T19:15:20	FLL releases pretty good prelim results. For 2015, full year adjusted EBITDA was $14mm vs $10.5 last year. 4q15 was ~$2.5 v $0.3 in 4q14.
ArtkoCapital	700486273719349250	2016-02-19T01:05:16	AlexRubalcava groditi maybe. He buys one new car a week just to prove to everyone his SAAR numbers are correct
ArtkoCapital	700382681507336192	2016-02-18T18:13:38	Excellent!  
ArtkoCapital	699962479414112256	2016-02-17T14:23:54	...which is insane because it's $25mm EBITDA growing in double digits leading athletic gear and business. That means it's trading at 1x-2x.
ArtkoCapital	699962164728037376	2016-02-17T14:22:39	That leaves the Parent. $120 MV less $20mm in cash less $50mm (at minimum) of spin off  leaves parent w $50mm market cap....
ArtkoCapital	699961863849668609	2016-02-17T14:21:27	So Gaia TV is worth $50-$75m and that excludes the $12-20mm of the CO building (shared economics after $12mm).
ArtkoCapital	699961527940440064	2016-02-17T14:20:07	So at $17.3mm run rate, prob $25mm ftm. Gaia TV should trade 2-3x revenues. NFLX after its crash is still trading 4.5x ftm revenues.
ArtkoCapital	699960711758217216	2016-02-17T14:16:52	Basically the stock is $122mm. $20mm in cash as of 3Q. That stays w parent. There is $20mm building but that's going w TV biz.
ArtkoCapital	699959935451332608	2016-02-17T14:13:47	Annual subscriber growth was 67% but not sure what it was for Q.
ArtkoCapital	699959639241150464	2016-02-17T14:12:37	Looks like annual run rate stands at $17.3mm, just about at break even.
ArtkoCapital	699959339818176512	2016-02-17T14:11:25	GAIA filed an amended form 10 for its upcoming (someday hopefully) Gaia TV spin off. 4Q rev growth appears at 50%+ so better than 35% guided

ArtkoCapital	699702156165718020	2016-02-16T21:09:28	Back to its spin off price and break even for us. Still positive but monitoring closely.
ArtkoCapital	699701766128971776	2016-02-16T21:07:55	Additionally trouble with Swathmore integration is notable. Maybe a little too big to swallow. Other tuck ins going well though.
ArtkoCapital	699701433441001472	2016-02-16T21:06:36	CSWI was disappointing. While organic growth ex energy was 4.7% energy dragged down OG to -3%. The exposure was much larger than expected.
ArtkoCapital	699700960482840576	2016-02-16T21:04:43	Growth in connections, revs and an obvs set up to beat guidance this year are all positive. Contributed positive FCF generation is welcome

ArtkoCapital	693278598287880192	2016-01-30T03:44:32	JoshMaher really nice story. I think will be acquired soon. 12-24 months.
ArtkoCapital	693277921000075264	2016-01-30T03:41:51	Not hard to imagine a couple of 50%-100% rev growth years.

ArtkoCapital	693277428521652228	2016-01-30T03:39:54	They beat rev expectations by 10%ish. Guided to 70,000 connections for 6/30. As of today they are at 43,200 6 months in. Prob will raise.
ArtkoCapital	693277023129567236	2016-01-30T03:38:17	I guess the market shrugged off USAT firing their CFO. Liked pre announcement better.
ArtkoCapital	693276752760573952	2016-01-30T03:37:12	Probably one of the better micro cap management teams. Just big worry they'll blow cash on a stupid acquisition.
ArtkoCapital	693276542273622016	2016-01-30T03:36:22	Not timing the market here but at current price dead money risk is big risk not capital loss. Upside is 200% plus.
ArtkoCapital	693276290154016775	2016-01-30T03:35:22	In general will probably muck through next 12-24 mnts at flat sales and profits, generate more FCF and are set up nicely for uptick in spend
ArtkoCapital	693275986637430785	2016-01-30T03:34:10	About $170mm market cap and $73mm in net cash. Added $12mm in net cash post divs and $2.5 of share repurchase. But came from big AR release.
ArtkoCapital	693275528866889728	2016-01-30T03:32:21	Some thoughts on GHM earnings call. Times are tough in the energy capital equipment space. These guys are hanging in there.
