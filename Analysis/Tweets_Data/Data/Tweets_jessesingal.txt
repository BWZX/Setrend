jessesingal	715576912622522371	2016-03-31T16:30:05	If Milo wants to argue that he as just being a cute troll when these photos were taken, he should say that

jessesingal	714290936742862848	2016-03-28T03:20:04	jackolanternC how so?
jessesingal	714290892128002048	2016-03-28T03:19:54	jackolanternC anyway, without getting into the weeds: in the biggest most recent samples they are careful to distinguish
jessesingal	714290828269719552	2016-03-28T03:19:38	jackolanternC this, to me, is how people misread the data. in the largest sample, 70% of the kids were in fact gender dysphoric
jessesingal	714290561704992768	2016-03-28T03:18:35	jackolanternC anyway, I dunno the "real" number because question is underdefined, but I think 80% is reasonablish
jessesingal	714290482873020417	2016-03-28T03:18:16	jackolanternC yeah, but it can simultaneously true that something's true and that jerks use it for nefarious ends
jessesingal	714290382318735360	2016-03-28T03:17:52	@AmberALeeFrost what started this thang?
jessesingal	714290195051462656	2016-03-28T03:17:08	jackolanternC it's way more than just being gender nonconforming
jessesingal	714290143377637376	2016-03-28T03:16:55	jackolanternC if you check the appendix of the Singh dissertation I link to in my article, she lists DSM V criteria for gender dysphoria
jessesingal	714290049932771328	2016-03-28T03:16:33	No responsible researcher would call a GNC kid gender dysphoric. DSM guidelines aren't perf, but do distinguish 
jessesingal	714289659858272256	2016-03-28T03:15:00	jackolanternC I was okay with that as a rough approximation since it's the only gender ID clinic in the country. Not perfect, but okay
jessesingal	714287840826376192	2016-03-28T03:07:46	jackolanternC To me the important distinction is, unless everyone is lying to me, it was never about shaming the kid.
jessesingal	714287772903804928	2016-03-28T03:07:30	jackolanternC No, it did. But in a more nuanced way that people thought. Curious to hear what you think after you read.
jessesingal	714287514266255360	2016-03-28T03:06:28	jackolanternC the most recent samples here kept careful track of which kid fell in which category  
jessesingal	714287337786720256	2016-03-28T03:05:46	jackolanternC check out the piece I go into more detail
jessesingal	714287306333634560	2016-03-28T03:05:39	jackolanternC common misconception. they very explicitly told their kids that boys can play dress up, girls can play hockey
jessesingal	714287144529969152	2016-03-28T03:05:00	jackolanternC desistance means the dysphoria abated. some stats here: 
jessesingal	714287021263601664	2016-03-28T03:04:31	jackolanternC nope, in terms of desire to be the other sex. he didn't care about gender roles

jessesingal	714286401811046400	2016-03-28T03:02:03	jackolanternC simply because there was the expectation of desistance and it never came about?
jessesingal	714285534533840897	2016-03-28T02:58:36	jackolanternC sure. Though FWIW zucker and all his people told me that yeah, some kids persist. They just don't think it's easy to predict
jessesingal	714284582527479808	2016-03-28T02:54:49	jackolanternC you might like this article less, then   but okay to disagree of course

jessesingal	714199015009738752	2016-03-27T21:14:49	Yes. This is why it's tricky, and anyone who acts like it's simple misunderstands things. 
jessesingal	714198372542988288	2016-03-27T21:12:15	.boodleoops helensaxby11 Sure, BUT let's say that dysphoria stuck around. In that case maybe it woulda been worse? Hard for me to say.
jessesingal	714198185351200769	2016-03-27T21:11:31	But yeah I should double-emphasize that: gender-affirmers aren't calling for *surgical* interventions on really young kids. Mostly rumor.
jessesingal	714197221022048256	2016-03-27T21:07:41	7/ for persisters. Challenge is figuring out who will persist, as Devita Singh notes in her important 2012 dissertation on GIC.
jessesingal	714197143213510656	2016-03-27T21:07:22	6/ put 8-year-olds under the knife, but I really think that's a fringe position. But yeah: signs of benefits to earlier social transition
jessesingal	714196972975099904	2016-03-27T21:06:42	5/ with agendas argue, doing surgery on really young kids. Common line among folks with agendas is that trans activists are itching to
jessesingal	714196837956263941	2016-03-27T21:06:09	4/ an earlier social transition, and to not forcing them to go through cis puberty. We're talking SOCIAL transition, not, as some people
jessesingal	714196719664283649	2016-03-27T21:05:41	3/ There is solid evidence. BUT for the group that is going to "persist," meaning ID as trans when they are adults, there are benefits to
jessesingal	714196585240985600	2016-03-27T21:05:09	2/ one is that most people who are gender dysphoric as kids will eventually ID as cis. This has been attacked as a "myth," but it isn't.
jessesingal	714196355359633408	2016-03-27T21:04:14	1/ My understanding of the scientific consensus, including Zucker's is you need to balance two competing concerns 
jessesingal	714195447678676992	2016-03-27T21:00:38	Can a parrot act as a witness in court? The bizarre case of Echo, a parrot who saw too much:  
jessesingal	714194676778213377	2016-03-27T20:57:34	Amazing these books are 1) extremely, remarkable oppressive; but 2) the oppression is so well-hidden they get nominated for LGBT awards!
jessesingal	714178548081278977	2016-03-27T19:53:29	It's legitimately tricky. If someone is going to ID as trans you don't want to subject them to cis puberty 
jessesingal	714178149177757696	2016-03-27T19:51:54	"As soon as we take out vicious bigots like fakedansavage, the world will be a better place." - smart people who have thought stuff thru
jessesingal	714177831610269697	2016-03-27T19:50:38	It's tricky, because puberty can be traumatic for gender dysphoric people. That's why they prescribe blockers. 
jessesingal	714176257651580928	2016-03-27T19:44:23	Yeah, that's why the GIC impressed on kids that what you do doesn't define your gender. Girls can play hockey etc 
jessesingal	714175571949928448	2016-03-27T19:41:39	No clear answer. Zucker.colleagues believed older a kid IDed as "cross-sex," more likely they'd be trans adult 
jessesingal	714173007955169280	2016-03-27T19:31:28	3/ I'm confused why some activists view it as a smart approach to lump in people like Dreger with actual transphobes, who are legion.
jessesingal	714172711241662464	2016-03-27T19:30:17	2/ coherent understanding of gender, just make that argument. Dreger never effing called for adult reparative therapy. Jesus.
jessesingal	714172488285028352	2016-03-27T19:29:24	1/ All the accusations that Dreger is for "reparative therapy" come from GIC-related stuff. If you think a 5-year-old has a clear and
jessesingal	714170929606164480	2016-03-27T19:23:12	I mean if you told them, "You get to decide what sort of speech is and isn't punishable" 
jessesingal	714170810920017926	2016-03-27T19:22:44	The problem is that b/c it's framed as cis people oppressing white people, folks scared to call out bullshit. 
jessesingal	714170443717087233	2016-03-27T19:21:17	If you asked the median American to enact a system of laws government speech, it would be a lot more restrictive than the First Amendment

jessesingal	713762387141267456	2016-03-26T16:19:48	1/ Anyway. I might sometimes come across as harder on lefty folk. Overall, I think right-wing authoritarianism poses a FAR bigger threat
jessesingal	713761512700059649	2016-03-26T16:16:20	And even worse, it makes it *feel* easier at the same time! People act like they understand stuff they don't.

jessesingal	713760020765286400	2016-03-26T16:10:24	5/ point in all this whining being that lotsa people don't take race seriously, don't take white privilege seriously. When folks on the

jessesingal	712075514064838656	2016-03-22T00:36:46	slainv_fr sorry. basically just means raise or take money from somewhere and put it elsewhere. raise top marginal tax rate, for example.

jessesingal	712075114578313216	2016-03-22T00:35:11	we might be speaking different language --"redistribution" means something fairly specific in public-policy speak 
jessesingal	712075002217144320	2016-03-22T00:34:44	yes. And efforts to desegregate schools/neighborhoods will always have important multiplier effects 
jessesingal	712074883983937536	2016-03-22T00:34:16	2/ enough way, it will eventually be fixed. I just think there are so many reasons couched in psychology to be skeptical of that idea.
jessesingal	712074719995043840	2016-03-22T00:33:37	1/ There is an academic tradition that holds that if you can get white people to investigate their own internalized racism in a hardcore-

jessesingal	708716600829018112	2016-03-12T18:09:39	Didn't know right was so upset about this old quote. Just as hysterical/easily offended as campus left sometimes

jessesingal	708715801038213120	2016-03-12T18:06:28	CountUlairi speechboy71 do you think that was an expression, or that he really was calling for violence?
jessesingal	708711593421443073	2016-03-12T17:49:45	If Obama's America were really as bad as establishment Republicans like Rubio say it is, it would call for Trump-style reaction.
jessesingal	708714359220998144	2016-03-12T18:00:45	speechboy71 to get away with "we're gonna abolish the IRS!!!!!!" is... yeah. This is the intellectual stew in which things fermented
jessesingal	708714252845113344	2016-03-12T18:00:19	speechboy71 I think most complaints about "mainstream media" are dumb, but extent to which MSM media has allowed respectable candidates
jessesingal	708714180560470016	2016-03-12T18:00:02	Obama saying police sometimes treat blacks/Latinos poorly = pining for days of protesters being beat up

jessesingal	708713621619122177	2016-03-12T17:57:49	This is why all so much of the GOP kvetching about Trump dragging down the discourse is half bullshit 
jessesingal	708712509713342468	2016-03-12T17:53:24	JamesTomPul thank you! appreciated
jessesingal	708712300950192128	2016-03-12T17:52:34	.LemonBeeQueen Why is it that Trump claimed police told him to call it off and then CPD said "no we didn't." You're calling cops liars?
jessesingal	708712084306059265	2016-03-12T17:51:42	"New York Magazine" isn't implying anything. But yeah, Trump has already demonstrably lied a/b CPD, so am curious

jessesingal	708711208644448260	2016-03-12T17:48:14	JamesTomPul no it's all good -- think we just have a good-faith difference in opinion on whether free speech violated here
jessesingal	708711008504848385	2016-03-12T17:47:26	One way to disprove this would be to point to violence that occurred BEFORE the event was called off. Has anyone? 
jessesingal	708710053545644034	2016-03-12T17:43:38	This is honestly what the evidence suggests right now: Trump knew there'd be a lot of protesters, cancelled, blamed it on "violence"
jessesingal	708709844619010048	2016-03-12T17:42:48	If Trump cancelled the rally because he didn't want to get booed, that is NOT "suppression" of free speech 
jessesingal	708709164529410048	2016-03-12T17:40:06	Anyone seen solid reporting on number of injuries last night? If that Facebook guys is true and it's 3, that's... not very violent.
