MMFlint	705300377915297792	2016-03-03T07:54:48	Hillary would have still won. Not about Bernie v Hillary. It's voter suppress, gerrymandering, mass incarceration.  
MMFlint	705259722891464705	2016-03-03T05:13:15	Once again:Yesterday's election in those southern states was not a real election because so many black citizens were prohibited from voting.
