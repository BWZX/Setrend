david_glasner	721551608560148481	2016-04-17T04:11:23	duncancameron I see your point. Genoa not politically viable lasting only 6 years. B Woods lasted 26, but gld stndrd was semi-retired.
david_glasner	721537369569148930	2016-04-17T03:14:49	duncancameron I disagree. Genoa and Bretton Woods were very different. Anyone could buy gold bullion under Genoa.
david_glasner	721533993196371968	2016-04-17T03:01:24	MacRoweNick duncancameron OK, thanks for clearing that up for me. I was starting to get nervous.
david_glasner	721530383347662848	2016-04-17T02:47:03	MacRoweNick duncancameron Have you thought about what price you want to set for gold? maybe $100,000 an ounce?
david_glasner	721528562336063488	2016-04-17T02:39:49	MacRoweNick duncancameron 100% reserves against banknotes or deposits too? Do you think there's a meaningful distinction b/w notes &amp; deps?
david_glasner	721525632857939968	2016-04-17T02:28:10	MacRoweNick duncancameron But true that gold doesn't circulate hand to hand under the gold ex stndrd. could also call it a bullion stndrd
david_glasner	721524686350327809	2016-04-17T02:24:25	MacRoweNick duncancameron I think my point was that the gold ex stndrd was not different in kind from a gold stndrd as Milton claimed
david_glasner	721520965625245700	2016-04-17T02:09:38	MacRoweNick duncancameron Please remind me. What's the distinction?

david_glasner	720628359789547520	2016-04-14T15:02:44	RebelEconProf Money stocks can adjust to demand shift with no change in gold distribution. Increase in BoF gold stocks was clearly exognous

david_glasner	720617639412895745	2016-04-14T14:20:08	RebelEconProf Cntrl bank gold accumulation implies worldwide deflation. GD was caused by gold accumulation not wrong choice of FX parities
david_glasner	720616869229559808	2016-04-14T14:17:04	RebelEconProf There's an internat'l p. level in terms of gold. Local p. levels depend on parities chosen. Overvaluat'n =&gt; local deflation.
david_glasner	720443052444266498	2016-04-14T02:46:23	RebelEconProf Problem with French policy was gold accumulation which was deflationary for the entire world not just Britain. Big difference
david_glasner	720442799213178880	2016-04-14T02:45:23	RebelEconProf Yes pound was overvalued, requiring deflation. That was a problem for Britain not for the world. French policy was later.
david_glasner	720412691626496000	2016-04-14T00:45:44	MacRoweNick Monetary policy is basically helpless in a small open economy with fixed exchange rate. Mon. pol. matters for the whole system.
david_glasner	720409730418483200	2016-04-14T00:33:58	MacRoweNick GS not intrinsically bad. OK if you can get Hawtrey to manage it for you. Dangerous otherwise. B of F was the main culprit.
david_glasner	720408514749857792	2016-04-14T00:29:09	DavidBeckworth RebelEconProf Hitler came to power because of the GD. But the GD didn't happen because of restoring the prewar parity.
david_glasner	720391327003742208	2016-04-13T23:20:51	RebelEconProf Restoring the parity was largely an internal issue for Britain, but it had little to do with the GD.
