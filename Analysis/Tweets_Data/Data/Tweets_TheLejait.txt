TheLejait	710176034147045377	2016-03-16T18:48:55	And then some suggest congress (who's job it is to allocate resources where necessary) should begin to take control of the Fed in some way
TheLejait	710175635893661696	2016-03-16T18:47:20	Somehow, monetary policy (which is essentially just adjusting interest rates in the US) is also supposed to raise unemployment for EVERYONE
TheLejait	710175423271833600	2016-03-16T18:46:29	The utter stupidity of criticizing monetary policy for not being able to increase low wage and discouraged unemployed is exceptional
TheLejait	710172863110578176	2016-03-16T18:36:19	Disagree with Yellen here, CPI showed record highs for price drops in energy, still hurting inflation in the short term quite a bit
TheLejait	710166956427481090	2016-03-16T18:12:51	Boss brought up good point, maintaining the December dot plot would make the rate path for the year very much not gradual lol

TheLejait	710155167581143040	2016-03-16T17:26:00	Although Im sure with regards to mon pol, the Fed cares more about domestic inflation growth for consumers more than energy prices
TheLejait	710154881693196289	2016-03-16T17:24:52	US domestic market has seen pretty decent inflation growth over the last year, but energy prices are bringing that down a lot
