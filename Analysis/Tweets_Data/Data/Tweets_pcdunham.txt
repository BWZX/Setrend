pcdunham	724020425697583105	2016-04-23T23:41:35	So, as Iran comes back to the mkt post sanctions, prices will adjust and marginal producers will reduce production. It‚Äôs not complicated.
pcdunham	724018647249747969	2016-04-23T23:34:31	As prices move down the supply curve marginal producers will reduce supply. Iran and Saudi are literally the last 2 that will have to.
pcdunham	724017562707611648	2016-04-23T23:30:13	The only way Saudi can ‚Äútake‚Äù market share directly from Iran is to produce enough to push price below Iran cost.

pcdunham	724006882055081985	2016-04-23T22:47:46	ralvarezl oilinvestorlanc yes. Mexico has absolutely nothing to do with Saudi and proxy wars and their Middle East rivals. It is price.
pcdunham	724006109158088704	2016-04-23T22:44:42	ralvarezl oilinvestorlanc this is *really* simple: any market share will come from higher cost producers. That is all.
pcdunham	724005119939858432	2016-04-23T22:40:46	ralvarezl oilinvestorlanc the only thing definitive that they've said it that high cost producers will have to adjust.
pcdunham	724003612892893184	2016-04-23T22:34:47	ralvarezl oilinvestorlanc meanwhile, only thing that's changed in past 5 or so years is US production.
pcdunham	724003365244399617	2016-04-23T22:33:48	ralvarezl oilinvestorlanc now conventional assumption is that Saudi is trying to punish a bunch of countries with low oil prices
pcdunham	724003174529392640	2016-04-23T22:33:02	ralvarezl oilinvestorlanc before the thanksgiving 2014 OPEC meeting conventional assumption was that ME instability would increase prices
pcdunham	723992838409584641	2016-04-23T21:51:58	oilinvestorlanc regardless whether Saudi dislikes it.
pcdunham	723992713754857472	2016-04-23T21:51:28	oilinvestorlanc so it is about markets balancing because basically every other producer would cut before Iran has to regardless whether
pcdunham	723991846356021248	2016-04-23T21:48:01	oilinvestorlanc it doesn‚Äôt matter if everyone assumes Saudi doesn‚Äôt like Iran more than other countries.
pcdunham	723991532252987393	2016-04-23T21:46:47	oilinvestorlanc that loses money at $31 will stop producing
pcdunham	723991373800722432	2016-04-23T21:46:09	oilinvestorlanc price at which they both will not produce is $10, at $30 they will both produce at capacity and someone somewhere
pcdunham	723991026080174080	2016-04-23T21:44:46	oilinvestorlanc so if Iran produces at capacity based on price and Saudi produces at capacity based on price, and their (1/2)
pcdunham	723988933630009350	2016-04-23T21:36:27	oilinvestorlanc the only way they can be pushed out of any markets is by price.
pcdunham	723985890981208064	2016-04-23T21:24:22	oilinvestorlanc I'm not missing the point. Price is all that matters. The mkt will be balanced by higher cost producers than Saudi &amp; Iran.
pcdunham	723985402999132160	2016-04-23T21:22:25	oilinvestorlanc neither of them have to cut production until price goes low enough for both to cut. 
pcdunham	723984820401905665	2016-04-23T21:20:06	oilinvestorlanc Iran and Saudi cash costs are almost same. Market share retained from US shale was via letting prices go below shale costs
pcdunham	723981533439119360	2016-04-23T21:07:03	oilinvestorlanc they didn‚Äôt fight Iran for market share in the two decades pre sanctions why now?
