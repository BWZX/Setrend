Chris_Gaun	724972164051537922	2016-04-26T14:43:27	mjasay lauren_e_nelson "use" is a pretty low bar too
Chris_Gaun	724971170987163648	2016-04-26T14:39:31	rickyelqasem We can do that too, but if they're allowed to have that then why use platform?
Chris_Gaun	724971156495806464	2016-04-26T14:39:27	rickyelqasem Do you mean giving the dev actual API access to AWS?
Chris_Gaun	724970803071168512	2016-04-26T14:38:03	swapnilbhartiya didn't they do the key note yesterday
Chris_Gaun	724969896099106816	2016-04-26T14:34:27	rickyelqasem Also if you have standard components in VMs (say PostGres) you can do that too
Chris_Gaun	724969691446386692	2016-04-26T14:33:38	rickyelqasem Yeah we have that. No one wants one VM per container. But you can provision VMs.
Chris_Gaun	724967186758930434	2016-04-26T14:23:41	rickyelqasem what do you mean by cloud API? AWS? Azure? GCE? OpenStack?
Chris_Gaun	724956618178330624	2016-04-26T13:41:41	onovotny NYC. Alexa said now it is 50 but will get up to 70!

Chris_Gaun	724944918913888256	2016-04-26T12:55:12	rickyelqasem most of the follow up material are straight up technical comparisons. The one you saw is marketing honeypot
Chris_Gaun	724944584762114048	2016-04-26T12:53:52	rickyelqasem can also broker access to the AWS and Azure services or OpenStack HEAT - eg Redshift - based on roll of devs. Control amount
Chris_Gaun	724944018283581440	2016-04-26T12:51:37	rickyelqasem we do. We can (auto)scale infrastructure using vRealize Automation, OpenStack, SC, AWS and Azure.
Chris_Gaun	724943667069390851	2016-04-26T12:50:13	rickyelqasem VMware emc thanks. Will do
Chris_Gaun	724941902030757889	2016-04-26T12:43:12	rickyelqasem we do. However, people also ask "what about the others?"
Chris_Gaun	724941328455491584	2016-04-26T12:40:56	rickyelqasem You bring all your own infrastructure with the platform. We do the L7 load balancing and have integrations to do stuff below

Chris_Gaun	724769969053913088	2016-04-26T01:20:00	rickyelqasem you realize it is software? You can install it anywhere. Any cloud or even bare metal OS
Chris_Gaun	724769399891058693	2016-04-26T01:17:45	rickyelqasem literally neither of those things are true.

Chris_Gaun	704734862876479492	2016-03-01T18:27:39	swardley Yeah true. They're getting killed by public cloud and now Docker orchestration tools. Double whammy for VMW

Chris_Gaun	704731591352963072	2016-03-01T18:14:39	swardley I'd say that "chasing AWS, Azure, GCE, etc" is odd play by big vendors when there is clear opening in cloud middleware.
Chris_Gaun	704730907396194304	2016-03-01T18:11:56	That said IamStan Chris_Gaun, you could argue past record of former tech giants questions do they have the wit -

Chris_Gaun	704730862835933184	2016-03-01T18:11:45	swardley IamStan I agree with this. People are constantly confusing software with services. One you don't want to buy infrastructure.
Chris_Gaun	704730144204845056	2016-03-01T18:08:54	IamStan Oh I meant we need to the software something else
Chris_Gaun	704729988705214465	2016-03-01T18:08:17	I have met very few in the Global 2000 that mix up the use cases. Pundits get it wrong all the time 
Chris_Gaun	704729512681082880	2016-03-01T18:06:23	IamStan it is quite clear that I am of the opinion that if the success of your business is dependent on AWS failing then go home now
Chris_Gaun	704729167154323456	2016-03-01T18:05:01	IamStan When have I ever dismissed them? I'm saying if we labeled everything as "cloud" we'd miss the different use cases
Chris_Gaun	704727881398820865	2016-03-01T17:59:54	svrc OK. I hope it does and you get to cash out big!
Chris_Gaun	704727573608198144	2016-03-01T17:58:41	swardley I think CF will make money. Labs will make even more. But so will K8S, Mesos and more
Chris_Gaun	704725186919006208	2016-03-01T17:49:12	Super excited to see Apprenda bringing Kubernetes to the enterprise:  
Chris_Gaun	704727102969540609	2016-03-01T17:56:49	swardley I was never part of that group. I've been saying AWS was going to be huge since 2008
Chris_Gaun	704726868126277632	2016-03-01T17:55:53	IamStan No, I don't think that's the case at all. CF, OpenShift, Apprenda, opendeis, coreoslinux  have very little use case overlap
Chris_Gaun	704725342733344768	2016-03-01T17:49:49	svrc I am not trying to attack pivotal but Twitter pundits can be fucking out of their minds.

Chris_Gaun	704723648465281024	2016-03-01T17:43:05	.swardley I really don't. They grew 18% yoy last year while burning huge amounts of cash. 
Chris_Gaun	704721543385980928	2016-03-01T17:34:43	IamStan that's different space. We need to honestly stop calling it PaaS. Cloud middleware?
