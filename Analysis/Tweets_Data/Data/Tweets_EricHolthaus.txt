EricHolthaus	719599447756251136	2016-04-11T18:54:12	emeyerson yes. El Niño makes tropical wildfires more likely, which increases global CO2 levels.

EricHolthaus	719598947350622208	2016-04-11T18:52:13	cskolding more CO2 means the atmosphere is more efficient at trapping heat, which would quicken global warming. (1/2)

EricHolthaus	718111215084437506	2016-04-07T16:20:30	Meteorologists, by training, focus on the trees, not the forest. Climate change is about the forest.

EricHolthaus	718107917677830144	2016-04-07T16:07:24	asketchyfish nothing to be proud of, in my opinion: 
EricHolthaus	718107256496099328	2016-04-07T16:04:46	It’s time for meteorologists to step into the present and accept that human activity is driving extreme weather. 
EricHolthaus	718106256276230145	2016-04-07T16:00:47	CColose though, arguably, weather forecasters have a greater day-to-day reach with the general public, is my point.
EricHolthaus	718103740138434560	2016-04-07T15:50:48	Bad news: Meteorologists are confused, uncomfortable, and politically biased against talking about climate change.

EricHolthaus	718094198994378752	2016-04-07T15:12:53	SeanSublette will correct, thanks.
EricHolthaus	718094167478415360	2016-04-07T15:12:45	SeanSublette yes, shit, sorry Paul.

EricHolthaus	717960443575214080	2016-04-07T06:21:23	alisonborealis yes. it's one of the reasons i'm always so slow to write about stories, sometimes a week late. i think about it too much. :)
EricHolthaus	717960135067303936	2016-04-07T06:20:09	alisonborealis that's not journalism. a scientist would never just rework another scientist's paper. always need to move the story forward.
EricHolthaus	717959623903293440	2016-04-07T06:18:08	alisonborealis but usually what happens is, for traffic/money/time reasons, journalists see something trending &amp; rewrite in their own words
EricHolthaus	717959404742508544	2016-04-07T06:17:15	alisonborealis ideally, journalists would be able to interview key people on a story, and decide what the most truthful conclusion is
EricHolthaus	717959104342261760	2016-04-07T06:16:04	alisonborealis i mean, in theory, that's what journalism should be too... there's way way too much regurgitation for multiple reasons now.

EricHolthaus	717953784639401984	2016-04-07T05:54:55	I have no plans to quit journalism, but I envy the focus of the scientists I speak with every day. I know, I know... grass is always greener
EricHolthaus	717953384951582721	2016-04-07T05:53:20	I think where I'm at now is a happy medium: I get to immerse myself in the science for a day or two and move on. But journalism is draining.

EricHolthaus	713785997956222976	2016-03-26T17:53:38	GlobalEcoGuy yulsman raw monthly global temperatures are a pretty meaningless indicator of global change. anomalies correspond to impact.

EricHolthaus	713783557089419264	2016-03-26T17:43:56	GlobalEcoGuy yulsman I still think this is all because of an awkwardly worded sentence. this sentence: 
EricHolthaus	713610788771004416	2016-03-26T06:17:24	yulsman virtually all climate scientists track anomalies not actual temperature (for many reasons). Anomalies are what matter to adaptation

EricHolthaus	713117300627415040	2016-03-24T21:36:28	.borenbears Hansen and co-authors are in a totally different league of credibility than Curry. it's silly to make that comparison.
EricHolthaus	713115303996076032	2016-03-24T21:28:32	.borenbears fair enough if your standards are higher. if there was even a chance of Hansen's paper being true, I'd want to know, personally
EricHolthaus	713114780547026949	2016-03-24T21:26:27	EricHolthaus I guess I have higher standards. Wasnt worthy last July cause wasnt peerreviewed, science by pressrelease. Now different issue
EricHolthaus	713114126403305472	2016-03-24T21:23:51	.borenbears my decision to cover the story was mostly that this was a significant update to our story last July. that alone is newsworthy

EricHolthaus	713111555102150656	2016-03-24T21:13:38	EricHolthaus The study didnt merit AP story. Unproven badly reviewed science whether from Jim Hansen or Fred Singer isnt worth writing
EricHolthaus	713111381487132672	2016-03-24T21:12:56	.borenbears you also say interviewing these six scientists was your "own version of peer review". sorry, but can't possibly be as rigorous.
EricHolthaus	713110993409155073	2016-03-24T21:11:24	.borenbears so, to you, those critical comments made the paper un-newsworthy? (if un-newsworthy is a word, forgive me)
EricHolthaus	713110810038378496	2016-03-24T21:10:40	.borenbears you say here that those critical comments convinced you the Hansen study "wasn't worth writing about."

EricHolthaus	709482797031936000	2016-03-14T20:54:15	That is beautiful. May we hold these thoughts in our hearts and breathe life into them.

EricHolthaus	709481895722004480	2016-03-14T20:50:40	I try to tell the truth on climate as accurately and as engagingly (if that's a word?) as I can. I can always do better, and strive to.

EricHolthaus	709480905241264128	2016-03-14T20:46:43	With a topic of such global import as climate change, there's no space for condescension among scientists/journalists. We all have own style

EricHolthaus	709055153672851456	2016-03-13T16:34:56	One of the things science can teach its practitioners is humility. Respect for others who know something you don't.
EricHolthaus	709054538829856768	2016-03-13T16:32:30	We really need explainers of science. They need to get stuff right and not condescend to their followers and other scientists.

EricHolthaus	709376784890920960	2016-03-14T13:52:59	DavidWLea but you're right, there's not much we can say right now about how much 2016 warmth will linger in coming years.
EricHolthaus	709376529608773633	2016-03-14T13:51:58	DavidWLea I mostly agree with you, though again, depending on dataset, the 2016 jump is much bigger than the 1998 jump.
EricHolthaus	709373368328269825	2016-03-14T13:39:25	DavidWLea per JMA data, 2016 is slightly higher deviation from trend than 1998. much more pronounced in NASA data.

EricHolthaus	709370249829752832	2016-03-14T13:27:01	DavidWLea looking at every monthly anomaly since 1880 in NASA dataset, monthly deviations from annual ave aren't getting more pronounced.
EricHolthaus	709368021068808192	2016-03-14T13:18:10	DavidWLea Is your point that even not-unusual deviations from the trend are producing record anomalies? If so, I agree.
