bencasselman	715939061609971712	2016-04-01T16:29:08	MayankSeksaria Recent uptick could still be noise. But taken at face value, seems to suggest more room for LF growth than often assumed.

bencasselman	712406583003750400	2016-03-22T22:32:19	Nate_Cohn Well given that I am one of those obnoxious ggplot2 proselytizers...
bencasselman	712406273812242439	2016-03-22T22:31:06	NateJCB Really all that needs to be said, honestly.
bencasselman	712405969662287872	2016-03-22T22:29:53	Other advantage of course is that dplyr -&gt; tidyr -&gt; ggplot2 work so smoothly together. Thanks hadleywickham! (/end)
bencasselman	712405574437232641	2016-03-22T22:28:19	But if you're learning R from scratch, and you do a lot of exploratory analysis, I don't see why you'd learn base instead of ggplot2. (7)
bencasselman	712405449266610176	2016-03-22T22:27:49	Now I say "significantly superior." That may not be true if you already know base R well. Might not be worth learning new grammar. (6)
bencasselman	712405268240457728	2016-03-22T22:27:06	The still-in-development ggvis has potential to be even better for this, btw. Being able to easily add tooltips, for example, is huge. (5)
bencasselman	712405057388601344	2016-03-22T22:26:16	For that, ggplot2 seems significantly superior. Much easier to tweak/adjust during data exploration phase. (4)
bencasselman	712404868263186433	2016-03-22T22:25:31	But what these articles miss is that for most of us, most of the work comes BEFORE we know what we want the chart to look like. (3)
bencasselman	712404700746924036	2016-03-22T22:24:51	Most of these articles take form of "is it easier to make XYZ chart" in ggplot2 v base. Answer is usually "whichever you know best." (2)
bencasselman	712404388367704064	2016-03-22T22:23:36	Lots of recent rstats debate about ggplot2 vs base. Ultimately, of course, there's no right answer beyond "what works for you." But... (1/)

bencasselman	700398711210430464	2016-02-18T19:17:20	jsalsman Right, I'm not endorsing their findings as relevant. But I haven't seen any other estimates suggesting a big participation boost.
bencasselman	700396108737069056	2016-02-18T19:06:59	I talked to the economist who produced the glowing analysis of Bernie Sanders' plans. He's not voting for Bernie. 
bencasselman	700392879999619072	2016-02-18T18:54:09	jsalsman I'm also skeptical of his assumptions re: multipliers, but that isn't my area of expertise and I haven't criticized publicly.

bencasselman	700380588004474882	2016-02-18T18:05:19	jsalsman BenEagles But it's going to take more than just a stronger economy to accomplish that.
bencasselman	700380315307606016	2016-02-18T18:04:14	jsalsman BenEagles I think you CAN argue that there are policies that could reverse long-term decline in prime-age participation.
bencasselman	700380019802161153	2016-02-18T18:03:03	jsalsman BenEagles But there's just no credible way to come up with a "gave up looking" number in the tens of millions.
bencasselman	700379771323154433	2016-02-18T18:02:04	jsalsman BenEagles Look, I've been arguing for YEARS that the participation rate reflects labor market weakness. I stand by that.

bencasselman	700071569662541824	2016-02-17T21:37:23	BenEagles But no realistic solution leads to a sharp reversal. These are decades-long problems.
bencasselman	700071479497588736	2016-02-17T21:37:02	BenEagles The longer-run decline in employment rates, esp. among men, is harder to explain. Beyond scope of Twitter (at least right now).
bencasselman	700071147585544193	2016-02-17T21:35:42	BenEagles Well, large chunk recent drop is due to demographics. We can argue about what %, but it's very big.

bencasselman	700070504502263808	2016-02-17T21:33:09	brycecovert Yes. Long-term, more skilled workforce could boost supply. But more immediately, lots of 20-yr-olds in school instead of work.

bencasselman	700069758562148352	2016-02-17T21:30:11	BenEagles There's some evidence that it has at the margin, yes. And private insurance still more expensive than employer-provided.
bencasselman	700069571059916800	2016-02-17T21:29:27	BenEagles I'm not arguing against these policies. I'm just saying I don't see how they lead to a near-term leap in labor participation.
bencasselman	700069411923894272	2016-02-17T21:28:49	Robotbeat Right. That's playing a looong game. (And we should play it! But doesn't get you to 65% epop in 2025.)
bencasselman	700069205354409984	2016-02-17T21:27:59	BenEagles I agree! But at the margin, likely to reduce labor supply. Don't need to keep that job to get health care.
bencasselman	700068737823731713	2016-02-17T21:26:08	But you're already fighting major demographic headwinds. I just don't see how you get back to 65% epop.

bencasselman	700067868906491904	2016-02-17T21:22:41	Even if you set aside demographics, Sanders wants to make college free, unlink health care from employment and enhance Social Security.

bencasselman	687304872161599488	2016-01-13T16:07:05	This makes no sense. Why would you compare military spending as GDP-shares?

bencasselman	687297644587266048	2016-01-13T15:38:22	Jed_Graham You say, "ObamaCare's employer mandate is worse than its critics feared." Critics predicted disaster.

bencasselman	685564083723108352	2016-01-08T20:49:49	shanegreer And the underlying survey data is all public. So I'd argue yes.
bencasselman	685563787177373697	2016-01-08T20:48:38	shanegreer Well, the definitions they use are effectively unchanged since World War II or even earlier.
bencasselman	685561036464758784	2016-01-08T20:37:42	shanegreer But 1.8 million young adults haven't "given up" looking for work. And certainly not all in one month!
bencasselman	685560760341106689	2016-01-08T20:36:37	shanegreer There are definitely great areas, and it's totally legitimate to argue official unemployment rate doesn't tell whole story.
