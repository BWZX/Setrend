JoyceCarolOates	714999341539307521	2016-03-30T02:15:01	Interesting that viewers can come away from "Doris" with totally differing interpretations: cruel satire/ sympathetic comedy.
JoyceCarolOates	714998665111347202	2016-03-30T02:12:20	Fundamentally "Doris" is a story of a woman doomed to reenact her hoarder-mother's life--except falling in love (if naively) redeems her.
JoyceCarolOates	714998020123787264	2016-03-30T02:09:46	Overheard viewers arguing that "Doris" is cruel to an older woman--but I don't see it that way. Comedy of eccentricity, character, naivete.
JoyceCarolOates	714997773892993024	2016-03-30T02:08:47	"Hello, My Name is Doris" wonderfully directed (Michael Showalter) &amp; performed (radiant Sally Field). Highly recommend.
JoyceCarolOates	714996812881461248	2016-03-30T02:04:58	"Hello, My Name is Doris"--classic trajectory of comedy that boldly approaches but does not plunge into bathos, taboo.
