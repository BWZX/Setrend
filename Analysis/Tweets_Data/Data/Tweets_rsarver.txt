rsarver	715412076789760001	2016-03-31T05:35:05	msquinn really? The point I'm making w nabeel is that if public valuation changes are news, so should be private, esp at that stage

rsarver	715377800727769088	2016-03-31T03:18:53	jrichlive nabeel except these are the unlisted ones that get re-priced infrequently and become comps for other private rounds
rsarver	715376910277017605	2016-03-31T03:15:21	nabeel and to be clear, those mark ups/downs are a combination of public comps + performance
rsarver	715376743624773632	2016-03-31T03:14:41	nabeel hear what you are trying to say but that's like saying reporting on public stock value changes isn't news

rsarver	697445297975242752	2016-02-10T15:41:31	arjunsethi similar != same. Of course that's true
rsarver	697443470709948416	2016-02-10T15:34:15	arjunsethi you're fighting the wrong fight. Those same differences are true of Twitter and FB and I would say they serve similar use cases
rsarver	697443244112654338	2016-02-10T15:33:21	arjunsethi not doubting it's bigger with much higher engagement, but 3x isn't an order of magnitude and MAU is roughly the same
rsarver	697441921485008896	2016-02-10T15:28:06	arjunsethi not sure I agree with both statements. Lots of overlap in expression, obv some differences tho. Order of magnitude = 3B??

rsarver	697436079893278720	2016-02-10T15:04:53	AntDeRosa still so frustrating to me that I can't just follow "NHL" and get the best of that content. Lists are great for pros like you.
rsarver	697435031812202498	2016-02-10T15:00:43	AntDeRosa ah. Yes, for sure. The biggest thing in my mind is how hard it is to find the content you are interested in. Filter is 2nd level
rsarver	697434692375588864	2016-02-10T14:59:23	adammarx13 read that BuzzFeed article on how teens use it. It's "dialog" for them, just very different kind of communication.
rsarver	697434479275544576	2016-02-10T14:58:32	benthompson then it would come down to which product delivers the value to the whole audience or pockets of it
rsarver	697434354788622337	2016-02-10T14:58:02	benthompson that's definitely true, but if serving the same general purpose, they would both find their ideal userbase which should be same
rsarver	697434106578096128	2016-02-10T14:57:03	adammarx13 depends on what you mean by expression then, but agree in that facet of it
rsarver	697433684685623296	2016-02-10T14:55:22	AntDeRosa which things do you mean specifically?
rsarver	697433522064064513	2016-02-10T14:54:44	Will be interesting to see if Snapchat stalls due to its complex UI or if it and Twitter are just aimed at different enough audiences.

rsarver	697432997205712897	2016-02-10T14:52:38	Interesting that most of us think Twitter's problem is that it's too hard to use. Snapchat is much less obvious but more fun and expressive.
