aantonop	685587912491167744	2016-01-08T22:24:30	Ironically I mostly agree with the "statement from Core". I vehemently oppose the means used to fake unity, silence disagreement &amp; opponents
aantonop	685512763016359936	2016-01-08T17:25:53	btcdrak _jonasschnelli_ These actions are pouring fuel on a fire at a time when cooler attitudes and compromise are needed. Disappointing.
aantonop	685512533705396224	2016-01-08T17:24:58	morcosa btcdrak Again disingenuous. You know there's a big messy controversy and you choose this method and time to stomp all over it.
aantonop	685511338060312576	2016-01-08T17:20:13	btcdrak _jonasschnelli_ How convenient. I guess it's ok when you're "right" all means to get what you want are acceptable.
aantonop	685510771527315456	2016-01-08T17:17:58	btcdrak _jonasschnelli_ I'm tired of arguing this. If you can't see how this is causing more friction and fragmentation, it's a pity.
aantonop	685510591323238400	2016-01-08T17:17:15	btcdrak _jonasschnelli_ These types of actions are disrespectful to all who have contributed for years, as if their opinion doesn't count
aantonop	685510320182456320	2016-01-08T17:16:11	btcdrak morcosa It's very hard to push for consensus when you keep playing political games like this. I'm disappointed but not surprised
aantonop	685510003734777860	2016-01-08T17:14:55	btcdrak morcosa It's neither plain nor simple. It's a deliberate attempt to promote one side in an area of controversy as the only side.
aantonop	685505694687178752	2016-01-08T16:57:48	JohnLegere EFF Backpedalling furiously. EFF has been around a lot longer than T-Mobile and represents a much bigger community. Shame
aantonop	685504438975524864	2016-01-08T16:52:48	_jonasschnelli_ Conveniently presented as if it is unanimous by hiding the controversy behind a vague "we". Not cool.
aantonop	685503448058572800	2016-01-08T16:48:52	morcosa I think it is disingenuous to hide controversy behind a vague "we", especially on contentious issues. Is being right so important?
aantonop	685251238661849088	2016-01-08T00:06:41	satoBit That would remove the illusion of unanimity that they are trying to weasel into with this propaganda. They disappeared the dissent
aantonop	685250309787090944	2016-01-08T00:02:59	lopp No it ceased to be impartial with the political games around the "press page" almost 4 years ago. My first "debate" with the admins
aantonop	685247752801005568	2016-01-07T23:52:50	 admins continue to abuse commit authority to impose opinion and hide controversy: 
aantonop	685247311786700800	2016-01-07T23:51:05	JustusRanvier We've gone from signed statements to using PR's to make statements that hide the controversy and dissent. Slippery slope
aantonop	685244746764279808	2016-01-07T23:40:53	Who is the "we" behind this statement that purports to represent the Bitcoin Core project?  
aantonop	685243177188605952	2016-01-07T23:34:39	Bitcoin Core released a statement today. Which begs the question: Who is making this statement as representing Bitcoin Core?
aantonop	685199616539754500	2016-01-07T20:41:33	humpa64 . I guess "air" is a skeuomorphic malopropism.

aantonop	685177251982393344	2016-01-07T19:12:41	Finished recording this week's LTB podcast on the topic of Segregated Witness. Episode airs on Saturday!
aantonop	685136529157689345	2016-01-07T16:30:52	What is a good and reliable archive of IRC chat logs for bitcoin-dev and bitocin-wizards?  Anyone have any suggestions?
aantonop	685128220262445057	2016-01-07T15:57:51	Segregated Witness testnet is now live. Excited to see rapid progress on this feature:  
aantonop	684940413233442816	2016-01-07T03:31:34	TraceMayer taariqlewis bergalex The wiki is incorrect. Soft-forks are forwards compatible which means they reduce validation incentives.
aantonop	684849499466907649	2016-01-06T21:30:19	shibuyashadows and more...CT is a massive privacy improvement. Coinjoin can be broken with statistical analysis of input/output value pairs
aantonop	684840528219881473	2016-01-06T20:54:40	TraceMayer taariqlewis bergalex I'm thinking that Taariq's feeling is correct. There's risk there too. That's why the versionbits matters
aantonop	684840236136984579	2016-01-06T20:53:30	Many of the core devs are now much more active on Twitter - this is great.   Their avatars are eggs - this is not so great  Hatch!
aantonop	684802258698027008	2016-01-06T18:22:36	cypherdoc2 pwuille Just because it *can* be done doesn't mean it should. This will become more of a debate now that a lot more can be done
aantonop	684797141890433025	2016-01-06T18:02:16	Another proposal based on the SegWit soft-fork script upgrades: Adding Confidential Transactions as a soft-fork.   
aantonop	684796657423138816	2016-01-06T18:00:20	cypherdoc2 pwuille Not as is, but I think it would allow someone to introduce Turing completeness as a soft-fork. Not sure.
aantonop	684780858138587136	2016-01-06T16:57:33	haakonnilsen pwuille The coolest part comes from the trick for script versioning soft fork upgrades by LukeDashjr
aantonop	684760184074432512	2016-01-06T15:35:24	While everyone is discussing pwuille SegWit's solution to scaling, I'm most excited by the "other" stuff it delivers, like script versions
aantonop	684759586390302720	2016-01-06T15:33:02	Segwit's soft-fork script versioning opens the door for rapid innovation. Here's one example:  
aantonop	684753717229436928	2016-01-06T15:09:42	nerdonica You can bookmark an individual heading (the URL contains a # anchor). Right-click and copy link from the heading and save it

aantonop	683403897218568192	2016-01-02T21:46:00	Working on the second edition of Mastering Bitcoin. I need a *great* illustrator in Feb-Mar. Pay bitcoin and with attribution. Suggestions?
aantonop	683403409219649536	2016-01-02T21:44:04	InvesterGadget gavinandresen You can read my book "Mastering Bitcoin" to answer those questions. Buy on amazon, or download from github
aantonop	683403137714016256	2016-01-02T21:42:59	TraceMayer I'd say it's a three-way-tie between pwuille (segwit and alot more) petertoddbtc (CLTV) and Greg Maxwell (CT, Segwit and more)
aantonop	681575987797168130	2015-12-28T20:42:33	When I return to DC, I'm going to introduce legislation to repeal the unconstitutional cyberspying bill that was enacted with the omnibus.

aantonop	682356251683065856	2015-12-31T00:23:02	JeromeLegoupil Assume good faith. Work is already in progress and dev commitment means nothing if not work.
aantonop	682348185726091264	2015-12-30T23:50:59	JeromeLegoupil There's commitment and dates for all the measures except the limit. It's a bit of an obvious omission.
aantonop	682347232692166657	2015-12-30T23:47:12	adam3us It's so close that it is worth the extra effort to reach the ones who are left out. My signature would be pointless, not a core dev
aantonop	682345959234400256	2015-12-30T23:42:08	adam3us It's the "more steps later" without any date or commitment that is the weak part of this proposal. Premature "mission accomplished"
aantonop	682337376216076291	2015-12-30T23:08:02	adam3us I'm optimistic that a few tweaks could bring 100% consensus. Still not quite there but very very close.
aantonop	682336970597519360	2015-12-30T23:06:25	adam3us It's not consensus until everyone agrees, right? Not everyone agrees without a timetable for a limit fix, in addition to segwit.
aantonop	682336559014662144	2015-12-30T23:04:47	adam3us While contentious hard fork is bad, a consensus-driven planned hard fork would polish SegWit (root of tree) and raise block limit.
aantonop	682336348393451520	2015-12-30T23:03:57	adam3us I am very positive about Greg's scaling proposal. I think it would be a lot stronger if there was a date commitment to 2-4-8
aantonop	682330638930690049	2015-12-30T22:41:16	adam3us SegWit is great, but it will take too long to implement to have a major impact. Need to also raise block size limit IMHO.
aantonop	682324229338062848	2015-12-30T22:15:47	I think the two sides are closer than ever on the block size debate. Just a small compromise and commitment needed to  get consensus.
aantonop	682229546234429440	2015-12-30T15:59:33	The difference between "settlement" and "payment" is a relic of old world. There should be no such distinction in Bitcoin.
