davidmaraniss	716431202975096834	2016-04-03T01:04:44	8) But Lombardi learned from the Jesuits that character is the will in action.
davidmaraniss	716430986754584577	2016-04-03T01:03:52	7) The only thing that Trump and Lombardi have in common is that they both went to Fordham University.
davidmaraniss	716430732332306432	2016-04-03T01:02:51	6) It was the pursuit of excellence that obsessed Lombardi.
davidmaraniss	716430191766159362	2016-04-03T01:00:43	5) Winning wasn't everything or the only thing for Lombardi. He was toughest on his team when they won but played poorly.
davidmaraniss	716429431275958272	2016-04-03T00:57:41	4) And if the point is that Lombardi would get away with anything because he won that is a complete mid understanding of him.
davidmaraniss	716428984087678976	2016-04-03T00:55:55	3) Lombardi rarely behaved like that off the practice field or in front of strangers.
davidmaraniss	716428697230770178	2016-04-03T00:54:46	2) Trump was just out of Wharton when Lombardi died in 1970. If it happened it would have had to have been years even before that.
davidmaraniss	716428310729900032	2016-04-03T00:53:14	1) I am very dubious of Trump's Lombardi anecdote in his interview with Wash Post.  Love to know when where and who.

davidmaraniss	688039970506932224	2016-01-15T16:48:06	16) Max was eager, he had watched the films, but this was still unexpected. He didn't even know where he had put his helmet...
davidmaraniss	688039767892692992	2016-01-15T16:47:18	15) He could have gone with someone younger, but he trusted McGee in big games.

davidmaraniss	688038224887861248	2016-01-15T16:41:10	10) Pete Rozelle saw Ed Sabol in locker room beforehand and handed him 15 complimentary tickets. Sabol gave them to a cameraman, who...
davidmaraniss	688037961322119169	2016-01-15T16:40:07	9) The most expensive ticket was 12 dollars, and still more than a third of the seats were empty...
davidmaraniss	688037797777772545	2016-01-15T16:39:28	8) Game would be watched by then the largest audience ever for a sports event, more than 65 million, but in person it didn't feel historic.
davidmaraniss	688037362392281088	2016-01-15T16:37:44	7) He had to win...not just for his legacy and the Packers legacy, but for the NFL.
davidmaraniss	688036979624275970	2016-01-15T16:36:13	6) Lombardi was so obsessed before the game that Marie left for Las Vegas for two days and he barely noticed she was gone.
davidmaraniss	688036745368236032	2016-01-15T16:35:17	5) Packers trained in Santa Barbara. Lombardi considered it good luck to stay in cities named for saints.

davidmaraniss	688036293960429568	2016-01-15T16:33:30	2) The game was a lowercase phenomenon that first year at the LA Coliseum - super bowl, no Roman numerals attached.
davidmaraniss	688036099931926528	2016-01-15T16:32:43	1) 50 NFL seasons ago, on this date Jan. 15, in 1967, Lombardi's Packers beat the K.C. Chiefs in the first Super Bowl.
