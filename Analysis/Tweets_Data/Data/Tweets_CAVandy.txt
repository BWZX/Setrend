CAVandy	714834863921229825	2016-03-29T15:21:27	nbits60 WilliamCohan a cynic's view could be Faber did Bass' dirty work.   Or just reporting "chatter."  All good.
CAVandy	714834009755361281	2016-03-29T15:18:03	Bill, I'm pro-info-getting-out. But w 20/20 hindsight, I suspect this might've been a sitch where caution was due.

CAVandy	714832776961327105	2016-03-29T15:13:09	nbits60 esp since, as WilliamCohan points out, it's all a confidence game. If you lose that, you're toast. Maybe be careful hinting at it.
CAVandy	714830753293594625	2016-03-29T15:05:07	bc of Bear and how fast that unraveled. But I don't think it's an overreaction to think a journalist might want to consider consequences.
CAVandy	714829766998810624	2016-03-29T15:01:12	As I said, no love lost for Fuld or Jimmy Cayne. But Paulson needed to stop the implicit backstop the market assumed 
CAVandy	714828983041437696	2016-03-29T14:58:05	No, and a journalist's job is not to yell fire in a crowded theater either. 
CAVandy	714828763448668164	2016-03-29T14:57:12	Seriously? It started here! LEH saw the BSC/JPM solution and assumed they'd have the same govt put in Sept. 
CAVandy	714827617577381889	2016-03-29T14:52:39	WilliamCohan but goes to my point about asking the Q or not. "Chatter" can be dangerous when amplified like that. There are consequences.
CAVandy	714826387098456064	2016-03-29T14:47:46	But I'll repeat, I'd've preferred a more orderly unwind of unsound businesses than the shitshow that was 2008-09 
CAVandy	714826000157306880	2016-03-29T14:46:13	no love lost for Bear's shitty oversight (or Fuld's) but I'd have preferred not to have brought GFC onto the world. 
CAVandy	714825639061270528	2016-03-29T14:44:47	GS was "not facing" Bear bc internal rules dictated limits to *one* firm, not as a call on Bear's ability to pay. 
CAVandy	714825132674519040	2016-03-29T14:42:47	WilliamCohan we'll never know if Bear had had more time to secure financing w/o a gun to its head it whether it would've failed.
CAVandy	714823021748469761	2016-03-29T14:34:23	WilliamCohan so they were and they were not accepting Bear as a counterparty. But Faber should have maybe not asked the Q. Accelerated fall
