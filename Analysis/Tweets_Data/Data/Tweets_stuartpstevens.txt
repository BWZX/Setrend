stuartpstevens	723547028911841280	2016-04-22T16:20:29	Balancing the budget will require, uh, revenue.Why is realDonaldTrump hiding his taxes? What is so bad he's afraid? 
stuartpstevens	723545242272587776	2016-04-22T16:13:23	If that's the case, realDonaldTrump should have won primary. Everybody else since 1976 did by now. He hasn't.  
stuartpstevens	723541467789062144	2016-04-22T15:58:23	Seems to me HillaryClinton should pick whomever she wants to lead next gen of D's. Electoral impact negligible. 
stuartpstevens	723537151841849344	2016-04-22T15:41:14	Voting for realDonaldTrump &amp; expecting coherent thought is like buying a lottery ticket &amp; expecting to win.  
stuartpstevens	723535412958892032	2016-04-22T15:34:19	Well, only 30% or less of USA like realDonaldTrump, so if this was planned, he's even bigger idiot than appears.

stuartpstevens	721173310810296321	2016-04-16T03:08:10	It is a crazy early deadline. In Ms. there is no party registration. Can walk in &amp; chose party on Election Day. 
stuartpstevens	721172481688616961	2016-04-16T03:04:53	Focus more on many voting issues around country but NY laws are problematic. Primary reg. date, no early voting

stuartpstevens	721169329916669956	2016-04-16T02:52:21	Romney gave and gives to many charities. And gives time and effort as well, not just a check.  
stuartpstevens	721143645336903680	2016-04-16T01:10:17	Well deserved. Wonderful book of stories that might have been lost of women who shaped our world.

stuartpstevens	720817549835771904	2016-04-15T03:34:30	I'd leave that to folks who know a lot more about Dem dynamics. But doubt many votes are in play now; just turnout. 
stuartpstevens	720816793166553089	2016-04-15T03:31:30	Absolutely. Again &amp; again. Switzerland is classic example. Automatic weapons in many homes of reservist,rarely used.

stuartpstevens	720815891663822850	2016-04-15T03:27:55	Yes.An example where ACA has made not bad situation worse. Can't say what will happen but few defending as  is.

stuartpstevens	720812126885904384	2016-04-15T03:12:57	I'm not against gun regs but interesting that VT among fewest restrictions in US &amp; 5x more people killed by moose. 
stuartpstevens	720809452224417792	2016-04-15T03:02:20	Maybe,but I can promise you Romney would have lost.

stuartpstevens	720806970093998081	2016-04-15T02:52:28	Not arguing. It was just viewed by many as possible success story of state exchange:  
stuartpstevens	720805674402189313	2016-04-15T02:47:19	It's a interesting question. In '12, only pro-Ocare ads in POTUS race directed to Hispanics.Will that change in '16? 
stuartpstevens	720804526148575232	2016-04-15T02:42:45	Not sure Kentucky Dem's would agree with this assessment.  
stuartpstevens	720801411894611970	2016-04-15T02:30:23	I expect that question has been asked before around the Sander's kitchen table.  
stuartpstevens	720801058331594752	2016-04-15T02:28:58	Sweden has  9.5m people. Their entire work force is only twice McDonalds in US. Giant banks?  
stuartpstevens	720790840126390274	2016-04-15T01:48:22	If you want to end MassIncarceration, have to talk about VIOLENT crimes. Drugs are 15% of prisoners. And dropping. 
stuartpstevens	720798023215747072	2016-04-15T02:16:55	This is devilishly clever.  
stuartpstevens	720796927353225216	2016-04-15T02:12:33	Well, there are less than 5 gun murders a year in Vermont. So getting paid with gun profits seems worth a mention.

stuartpstevens	720791961980915712	2016-04-15T01:52:50	It's like watching Euro soccer players fight. I mean, is somebody get serious about this?  
stuartpstevens	720790544587206658	2016-04-15T01:47:12	Advertising is all about repetition.  
stuartpstevens	720789250514419712	2016-04-15T01:42:03	Not to be pedantic but HillaryClinton did get paid for years as board member of USA's largest gun seller.  
stuartpstevens	720788155574530048	2016-04-15T01:37:42	This is Twitter. A serious writer attacked by "Mr. Babypants."   
stuartpstevens	720787303904317441	2016-04-15T01:34:19	I have no idea what HillaryClinton said in speeches - doubt big deal - but idea at least some won't come out by Nov. seems implausible.
stuartpstevens	720785432418496512	2016-04-15T01:26:53	Why is it that BernieSanders, with net-worth less than two Clinton speeches, is getting more grief about his taxes than realDonaldTrump?
stuartpstevens	720784331946340352	2016-04-15T01:22:30	Well, it must take a ton of energy to go through four bankruptcies and get married three times. realDonaldTrump

stuartpstevens	720731344981139456	2016-04-14T21:51:57	Is this what realDonaldTrump advocates for American troops? The "worse than water boarding" he said he'll order.

stuartpstevens	720700747797700608	2016-04-14T19:50:22	This proves CLewandowski_ is a liar who attacked a woman's character when he thought he could get away with it.  
stuartpstevens	720683290219425792	2016-04-14T18:41:00	So what's "settled" is that Lewandowski hurt someone, and then he and Trump lied and smeared the victim to cover it up. Right?
stuartpstevens	720678602103128064	2016-04-14T18:22:22	Why does it take a legal system to compel a guy to apologize for doing something stupid and hurtful? Maybe decency?

stuartpstevens	720677547302895616	2016-04-14T18:18:11	Just a beautiful piece.  
stuartpstevens	720630344928595969	2016-04-14T15:10:37	Seems curious that BernieSanders is held more responsible for something a supporter said than what HillaryClinton said herself.
stuartpstevens	720613875960270849	2016-04-14T14:05:11	This isn't true but realDonaldTrump is saying 10 months prep wasn't enough? Ike finalized invasion plans in less.

stuartpstevens	720292768724217856	2016-04-13T16:49:13	True. A VP-turned-POTUS and a two-term governor of a big state. Light years from today's two frontrunners. 
stuartpstevens	720050325051281408	2016-04-13T00:45:50	This has happened so many times in Obama Administration. Going from covering to working for with no break.  
stuartpstevens	720046071636885505	2016-04-13T00:28:55	Yes. It would be problematic for many reasons if realDonaldTrump had declared FL. residency.  
stuartpstevens	720045671349235712	2016-04-13T00:27:20	This works better if she wasn't in it. She approved it by being in it.

stuartpstevens	719200046475030528	2016-04-10T16:27:07	Yes, Libyans were looking to buy arms. Blumenthal actually has ownership in Osprey as well.

stuartpstevens	719173605662289920	2016-04-10T14:42:03	Just a reminder before NY primary that realDonaldTrump hasn't released taxes; we have no idea if he pays more NY taxes than Cruz or Kasich.

stuartpstevens	718997514708520963	2016-04-10T03:02:20	Love to see any of that. The Board minutes are also public.  
stuartpstevens	718992916350431232	2016-04-10T02:44:04	I'm not a Walmart basher. But what reason is there to believe Clinton did this? Board minutes?  
stuartpstevens	718988510041124864	2016-04-10T02:26:33	Well, when you are paid by country's largest gun seller, that is part of your gun record. How could it not?  
stuartpstevens	718988072722046976	2016-04-10T02:24:49	No problem with Clinton being on Walmart board. But just seems should be acknowledged as USA's largest gun seller.

stuartpstevens	718981486033117184	2016-04-10T01:58:38	No problem with that. But let's acknowledge Clinton is only candidate to profit from gun sales as WM Board member. 
stuartpstevens	718979583073263616	2016-04-10T01:51:05	Umm. Great. Walmart was also America's largest gun seller while HillaryClinton was on Board.

stuartpstevens	717223534045622272	2016-04-05T05:33:10	Please ask realDonaldTrump the years Lincoln was in office. Please?   
stuartpstevens	717205638166786048	2016-04-05T04:22:03	Seems that this is a question is the point. France gave us the Enlightenment &amp; isn't afraid of intellectual honesty.

stuartpstevens	717199566102249472	2016-04-05T03:57:56	Romney has supported raising minimum wage indexed to inflation since running for governor. Obama later agreed.

stuartpstevens	717188518049619968	2016-04-05T03:14:02	No. Obama was first nominee.  
stuartpstevens	717188255553359872	2016-04-05T03:12:59	Since BernieSanders is favored by under 35 voters about a million to one, is it great long term strategy to say they're not really Dems?

stuartpstevens	717184682199224320	2016-04-05T02:58:47	Yes, as did Dean and Kerry.. Primary was never full fed funding, as you know. But Obama was first nominee to reject  
stuartpstevens	717143582222729220	2016-04-05T00:15:28	Hope he'll point out it was Barack Obama who became first nominee since Nixon to reject public financing.  
stuartpstevens	717141685864701952	2016-04-05T00:07:56	Allowed? A Clinton donor is trying to tell the Republican Governor of Ohio he can't run in Republican primary?

stuartpstevens	717106671676481536	2016-04-04T21:48:48	Um. This "little Congo" is where airlines like to overnight planes as safer haven than across the river in big Congo

stuartpstevens	716490855897546752	2016-04-03T05:01:46	Actually I think the arguments Admin. are making for success are classically Republican with strengths &amp; weakness.  
stuartpstevens	716489628321259520	2016-04-03T04:56:53	My point is just many of voices who normally speak up for those left behind have been muted in support of POTUS. 
stuartpstevens	716488909358817280	2016-04-03T04:54:02	No. The 16 million more on food stamps aren't there because jobs are great. Or the 20% increase in child poverty.

stuartpstevens	716481014361694208	2016-04-03T04:22:40	I agree with this. Trump &amp; Sanders both talk about it and it's much more revealing.  
stuartpstevens	716480694105538560	2016-04-03T04:21:23	And most everything was a little to a lot cheaper. Not to fight Obamacare wars but it's an added cost for many.

stuartpstevens	715324917210853376	2016-03-30T23:48:45	Have to say realDonaldTrump seems to be speaking more from heart when defending violence against women than punishing women for abortions.

stuartpstevens	715248055310794752	2016-03-30T18:43:19	This seems logical follow-up to day spent by realDonaldTrump defending violence against women.  
stuartpstevens	715247378731651073	2016-03-30T18:40:38	I'd suggest Presidential race, particularly Trump, is driving POTUS numbers up. Law of unintended consequences.

stuartpstevens	715203780820774912	2016-03-30T15:47:23	The idea there are "hidden" realDonaldTrump supporters who don't want to admit it in public? What does that say about candidate &amp; campaign?

stuartpstevens	715199939773665280	2016-03-30T15:32:08	This guy really is Putin's lapdog.  
stuartpstevens	715198219194642432	2016-03-30T15:25:17	Not to get hung up on reality but realDonaldTrump was losing to BernieSanders by an average of 17.4 points. Before his manager was charged

stuartpstevens	715194701897449474	2016-03-30T15:11:19	This doesn't make sense. The winner of primary is nominee. By definition.  
stuartpstevens	715188227615883264	2016-03-30T14:45:35	No ambiguity realDonaldTrump is trying to justify violence against women: defenders of  domestic/work violence can use Trump talking points
stuartpstevens	715048145554681856	2016-03-30T05:28:57	With you there, brother, and think it's a disgrace. Doing everything I can to try to defeat him. A dangerous man.  
stuartpstevens	715046272386904064	2016-03-30T05:21:30	But in fairness, running for POTUS reveals more, means more. Now not just some rich guy chasing models calling Imus. 
stuartpstevens	715045245730340866	2016-03-30T05:17:26	Trump's been accepted by e'body: Dem's he gave money to, Clintons, Republicans, media that sucked up to him. 1/2 
stuartpstevens	715043727031549954	2016-03-30T05:11:24	If you mean others should have attacked him earlier I agree. But are you saying party should have banned him?  
stuartpstevens	715041087312818176	2016-03-30T05:00:54	Just the idea that Romney is responsible for Trump because Trump endorsed him in '12. I think it's absurd.  
stuartpstevens	715039998253350913	2016-03-30T04:56:35	No, they're dead. But when you grow up with that it's hard to believe in purity of party. Which I don't think is bad

stuartpstevens	715038402492686336	2016-03-30T04:50:14	I've been very critical of R party. But growing up in seg Dem south, not wired to believe any party is perfect.

stuartpstevens	715035357960646658	2016-03-30T04:38:08	What I can't get over is her not understanding the role Castro played in all of this.  
stuartpstevens	715029702621138944	2016-03-30T04:15:40	Let's just don't posture. Sharpton is pure evil weaponized for political gain. Trump is evil. Call it out.  
stuartpstevens	715027347569815552	2016-03-30T04:06:18	HillaryClinton still has realDonaldTrump $100k. She hangs out with Trump.  
stuartpstevens	715025891252903936	2016-03-30T04:00:31	Romney said he didn't agree. But what do you say to Dems taking Trump money? Or POTUS elevating Al Sharpton?  
stuartpstevens	715022639258066944	2016-03-30T03:47:36	It's all disturbing.  
stuartpstevens	715021961211076608	2016-03-30T03:44:54	It's an Arab expression reflecting Trump's deep roots in radical Islamic culture.  
stuartpstevens	715021595115433984	2016-03-30T03:43:27	I think Romney has done a better job articulating case against Trump than most, including many writers.  
stuartpstevens	715020369434963968	2016-03-30T03:38:35	Or John Edwards. But this is a new low.

stuartpstevens	715017344616148992	2016-03-30T03:26:33	It's part of realDonaldTrump effort to mirror Saddam Hussein sons in every way, from housing tastes to language. 
stuartpstevens	715015579904643073	2016-03-30T03:19:33	I love this.

stuartpstevens	715006259976675328	2016-03-30T02:42:31	Of course raises question if anyone in public life has more FBI agents on their case but I leave that to others. 
stuartpstevens	715005098959769600	2016-03-30T02:37:54	Okay. I will use the corrected  less than 50 FBI agents are investigating Democratic frontrunner.  
stuartpstevens	715002372016226304	2016-03-30T02:27:04	This is a total lie by a known Shiite Cleric.  
stuartpstevens	715001068695003136	2016-03-30T02:21:53	Very cool 270toWin has lots of fun tools to play with. Highly recommend.  
stuartpstevens	714999490126733312	2016-03-30T02:15:37	Great. Let's see the returns. No person since Uday Hussein likes to show he has money. What's he hiding?

stuartpstevens	714992810462720000	2016-03-30T01:49:04	I am going out on a limb &amp; offering to post bail for CLewandowski_ next arrest if realDonaldTrump will release one year of tax returns.
stuartpstevens	714991957299372032	2016-03-30T01:45:41	Well, no.  
stuartpstevens	714989676428443650	2016-03-30T01:36:37	Just as true: Everyone knows realDonaldTrump is a fundamentalist Shiite Cleric.  
stuartpstevens	714988309437685761	2016-03-30T01:31:11	Before realDonaldTrump mounted full defense of using violence against women. 
stuartpstevens	714987132725628929	2016-03-30T01:26:30	Touching Class, First Semester.

stuartpstevens	714984906800148481	2016-03-30T01:17:40	It's easy to laugh at realDonaldTrump &amp; he is a joke but he's degrading running for President &amp; that hurts America.
stuartpstevens	714982922118434816	2016-03-30T01:09:47	So sick and tired of reporters who think tweeting snarky things about Trump is doing their jobs. Call him a liar. To his face.
stuartpstevens	714983660378800129	2016-03-30T01:12:43	Finally realDonaldTrump is approaching something close to his level of worth.  
stuartpstevens	714982657579487233	2016-03-30T01:08:43	This CLewandowski_  is same idiot who got busted for bringing a gun into Capitol. Says he forgot. 
stuartpstevens	714979735680495616	2016-03-30T00:57:07	Again, being a staffer does not give you some Deputy Dawg status. You have same legal authority as pizza delivery.   
stuartpstevens	714977227146977280	2016-03-30T00:47:09	Groan.  
stuartpstevens	714977097387745281	2016-03-30T00:46:38	So we are to believe a SS agent thought there was a threat, did nothing &amp; left it to a staffer? Not in a million yrs 
stuartpstevens	714960556667576320	2016-03-29T23:40:54	But he's not a journalist. He's a talent show judge so has dealt with high pressure situations.  
stuartpstevens	714958988249473025	2016-03-29T23:34:40	You are such a weakling  
stuartpstevens	714952622365675520	2016-03-29T23:09:23	Trump constantly lies. Doesn't expect to get challenged. Surrounds himself with sycophants. Toxic combination.  
stuartpstevens	714948651374788608	2016-03-29T22:53:36	Can someone please ask realDonaldTrump to name three elements of Common Core and how it came to exist?  
stuartpstevens	714946181890248704	2016-03-29T22:43:47	No. We have a simple test: of all the presidential campaigns we know through the years, has it happened? No.  
stuartpstevens	714942075003768832	2016-03-29T22:27:28	"Spare Me Your Hypocritical Journalism Lecture, Mr. President." Pretty blistering jackshafer take on POTUS speech. 
stuartpstevens	714941275879960576	2016-03-29T22:24:17	I don't think he would have done this to a male. And that's a pattern.  
stuartpstevens	714940768939544576	2016-03-29T22:22:16	Hopefully CLewandowski_ will follow with lawsuit about article on reporters he's been harassing. That will be fun. 
stuartpstevens	714939971992469506	2016-03-29T22:19:06	Has in the past but has their ever been a nominee who defended violence against women? Trump now has. Tough line.  
stuartpstevens	714937605616435200	2016-03-29T22:09:42	Queens is going to sue realDonaldTrump for defamation of character.
stuartpstevens	714935471810416640	2016-03-29T22:01:13	I really don't see how any candidate or official can associate with realDonaldTrump now that he's defending violence against women. How?
stuartpstevens	714934738595811328	2016-03-29T21:58:19	This is a man you wouldn't sit next to on a plane much less let near any public office.  
stuartpstevens	714930839193169920	2016-03-29T21:42:49	This is just one example of why the Trump name will always be associated with stupidity &amp; crassness.  
stuartpstevens	714919606004133889	2016-03-29T20:58:11	This is the single most disgusting public display by a presidential candidate since David Duke.  
stuartpstevens	714919140121776130	2016-03-29T20:56:20	This is a very sick man whom I doubt could get through TSA screening without losing it.

stuartpstevens	714916441980592129	2016-03-29T20:45:36	Every voter should realize this is a presidential candidate defending violence against women. Couldn't be clearer.  
stuartpstevens	714915666902589440	2016-03-29T20:42:32	Oh bullshit. And staff NEVER deals with any security issue even if it were true. Some kid auditioning to be Robin.  
stuartpstevens	714913824386768898	2016-03-29T20:35:12	A guy like CLewandowski_ never made it in campaigns. Bob Smith? Bob Ney? Typical of Trump world &amp; reflects anger toward successful women.
stuartpstevens	714911299516436482	2016-03-29T20:25:10	An angry little man who has surrounded himself with the aggrieved &amp; slighted.  
stuartpstevens	714908673869537284	2016-03-29T20:14:44	There's never been a national campaign with such visible anger toward women as realDonaldTrump. They are now officially defending violence.
stuartpstevens	714881829296336896	2016-03-29T18:28:04	I've done 5 presidentials. And, uh, you don't need to assault anybody. Male, female, press, civilian. Sort of basic. 
stuartpstevens	714878866712633345	2016-03-29T18:16:18	The English have a wonderful word for the likes of piersmorgan: a fop.  
stuartpstevens	714876460130021380	2016-03-29T18:06:44	Campaign's positive spin is manager just turned himself in for assault, not arrested? Well, go with what you got. 
stuartpstevens	714874613486993408	2016-03-29T17:59:24	Once again proving Carl_Hiaasen is a minimalist.   
stuartpstevens	714872159756279808	2016-03-29T17:49:39	Next, realDonaldTrump campaign buys CLewandowski_ a white Bronco.  
stuartpstevens	714871267430633472	2016-03-29T17:46:06	Go with John Edwards as early VP pick and sue everybody.  
stuartpstevens	714870234721726464	2016-03-29T17:42:00	It's clear why realDonaldTrump admires Putin so much:   
stuartpstevens	714867545031983108	2016-03-29T17:31:18	One thing we do know: there are a lot of male reporters larger than CLewandowski_ &amp; it's no coincidence he goes after female.
stuartpstevens	714866451988017156	2016-03-29T17:26:58	They are cheering at the Bada Bing.  
stuartpstevens	714866074748067840	2016-03-29T17:25:28	The "I didn't know who I was assaulting so it was okay" defense.  Put this next to the Twinkie and Rough Sex defense 
stuartpstevens	714859343892627456	2016-03-29T16:58:43	I thought he wouldn't win Iowa but would get out before facing defeat. Just dead wrong.  
stuartpstevens	714857684072337409	2016-03-29T16:52:07	I'm falling back to bragging about humility. 
stuartpstevens	714856782322122752	2016-03-29T16:48:32	Man, was I ever wrong about realDonaldTrump. But I'm wrong a lot.  
stuartpstevens	714842441820585984	2016-03-29T15:51:33	"Just a third rate assault" is the preferred usage.  
stuartpstevens	714839956355686401	2016-03-29T15:41:41	Consider realDonaldTrump campaign - manager up on charges, candidate attacking opponent's wife - and imagine this Thugocracy in WH.
stuartpstevens	714838051327967232	2016-03-29T15:34:07	So did CLewandowski_ lie to realDonaldTrump or did Trump know the truth &amp; decide to lie for him?  
stuartpstevens	714835567356350464	2016-03-29T15:24:14	A culture of lying is not unique to Trump world in our politics but there's an added viciousness to the Trump strain 
stuartpstevens	714833270425448448	2016-03-29T15:15:07	Now that's going back! Loved our oddball crew. We were lucky. Congrats on book. Really fantastic contribution.

stuartpstevens	714649753317941252	2016-03-29T03:05:53	I think a number of different versions have been commissioned over years. Believe Redford now owns rights.

stuartpstevens	714272511748358146	2016-03-28T02:06:51	This is broken down by electoral college.  
stuartpstevens	714271492410839040	2016-03-28T02:02:48	Cruz did disavow. That's different than taking responsibility for what a Superpac does as suggested. That's illegal. 
stuartpstevens	714270705777508352	2016-03-28T01:59:41	This is pretty great.  
stuartpstevens	714269576440242176	2016-03-28T01:55:12	Obama Pac was set up by Obama campaign. He raised money for it. Trump ad Pac no connection to Cruz, is anti-Trump.

stuartpstevens	713836016856088580	2016-03-26T21:12:23	There's no reason at all to believe realDonaldTrump is being audited. Yet to produce simple audit notice.  
stuartpstevens	713785327354265600	2016-03-26T17:50:58	Don't really buy this from a candidate who says the richest country in the world is a "poor country."  
stuartpstevens	713777751472410624	2016-03-26T17:20:51	Since Sanders has been Dem about as long as takes milk to spoil &amp; has 5m donors, could see both parties shatter.

stuartpstevens	712334538182148096	2016-03-22T17:46:03	No. It's a mockery of democracy to pretend those who have no choice are participating. It empowers dictators. 
stuartpstevens	712333860416176128	2016-03-22T17:43:21	Yes. Just as he did when he went to Bitburg Cemetery. Though RR on totalitarianism was pretty clear.

stuartpstevens	712328311117115393	2016-03-22T17:21:18	No. For a POTUS to refer to a "one party system" is to mock democracy &amp; quite Orwellian. Like a one item menu.

stuartpstevens	712119524863188993	2016-03-22T03:31:39	I know. As a friend used to remind me back in the day, "Models are people too."

stuartpstevens	712059478267535360	2016-03-21T23:33:03	Yep. The Silber-Trump parallels are interesting. But Silber had a ton of  IQ on him. Weld was spectacular.  
stuartpstevens	712058708059144192	2016-03-21T23:30:00	Yes.  
stuartpstevens	712058510381600768	2016-03-21T23:29:12	This is huge. Had to be in Congo to grasp what a monster he is. And he thought he'd never be held accountable.

stuartpstevens	712052357996158976	2016-03-21T23:04:46	Sure. Lots of examples.  
stuartpstevens	712051843929673729	2016-03-21T23:02:43	This is painful. Castro has done this for decades. They have google in Cuba, not WH?  
stuartpstevens	712050786881110016	2016-03-21T22:58:31	Well,  I'm hoping Marla Maples on DancingABC will clean up policy problems after this realDonaldTrump AIPAC speech.
stuartpstevens	712049902621171712	2016-03-21T22:55:00	I was trying to say that but you did it better. Just wonder if this is more about US corporate profits than idealism

stuartpstevens	712046352910389252	2016-03-21T22:40:54	Wait, so realDonaldTrump is keeping Iran deal if POTUS?  
stuartpstevens	712045905957031936	2016-03-21T22:39:07	Jeez, he wasn't even the first choice for a parade?  
stuartpstevens	712045447142109184	2016-03-21T22:37:18	There are no Cuban investors other than Castro circle of gov't. Doctors make $60 a month.  
stuartpstevens	712044454065147908	2016-03-21T22:33:21	How are they paying? You might check on that. This may be new for US but not Cand. &amp; Euros. Been doing it for years. 
stuartpstevens	712043783303602180	2016-03-21T22:30:41	Yes, but are we? Setting up Castros in new ventures isn't really trade. It just increases their power.  
stuartpstevens	712041929064759296	2016-03-21T22:23:19	I'm wrong all the time, hope you're right.I just have a lot of Can. friends who visit each year &amp; it just gets worse 
stuartpstevens	712041347902017537	2016-03-21T22:21:01	Don't get me started. I'm crazy right wing on China. I'd send gunboats up the Yangtze. Wrote 1st book about China.  
stuartpstevens	712040736301170693	2016-03-21T22:18:35	Why is it? I'm all for that but see no reason why. Cubans deal with Canadians/Euros all the time.Why are we special? 
stuartpstevens	712040007079436293	2016-03-21T22:15:41	I'm all for that. And not necessarily against changing policy. Just cynical about real motivations.  
stuartpstevens	712039695979585539	2016-03-21T22:14:27	Economy was more varied and less controlled than in Cuba. If only because of the vast scale/ geography. Cuba is tiny 
stuartpstevens	712038862609129480	2016-03-21T22:11:08	The Cuban gov't - not citizens - will be partners in every US business. It's making them richer not  public.  
stuartpstevens	712038298781401088	2016-03-21T22:08:54	I'd hope so. But they were very different economies 30 yrs ago than Cuba. $20 per month avg Cuban salary set by gov. 
stuartpstevens	712036677393518593	2016-03-21T22:02:27	That's not really accurate. China &amp; Vietnam were much more free 25 yrs ago than Cuba today.   
stuartpstevens	712036115147055105	2016-03-21T22:00:13	Don't think it's a big wedge issue. No one much cares. But most in US don't understand oppression of Cubans.  
stuartpstevens	712035430825336832	2016-03-21T21:57:30	No offense but it seems hard to look at Cuba &amp; not think Justice+peace+freedom lost &amp; corporate profits won. 
stuartpstevens	712034883133181952	2016-03-21T21:55:19	Jobs? Do you know what the average salary is in Cuba and that all salaries are controlled by gov't? Not changing. 
stuartpstevens	712034166062374913	2016-03-21T21:52:28	Yes, but not sure that's just a rationale for conceding dictators outlasted those opposed.  
stuartpstevens	712033607230029824	2016-03-21T21:50:15	It seems to be a terribly bad bargain that will allow Castros to direct key initial US investments.  
stuartpstevens	712031978887974920	2016-03-21T21:43:47	That's OK, Mark--I'm not sure the current editor knows how to spell "Republic" 
stuartpstevens	712031986731319298	2016-03-21T21:43:49	Good point. But any reason to think increasing wealth &amp; power of Castro regime helps anyone but those in power?  
stuartpstevens	712031085622857728	2016-03-21T21:40:14	We definitely have better rock and roll and that's no small thing.

stuartpstevens	712026945140166656	2016-03-21T21:23:47	Canadians and EU have been traveling to Cuba for years. Seems bit presumptuous that magical Americans will now change Cuba.
stuartpstevens	712018784006115329	2016-03-21T20:51:21	I can't believe it.

stuartpstevens	709760326439456768	2016-03-15T15:17:03	There's a logical case that Cruz has decided 2016 nomination is basically over &amp; he's now playing for 2020.  
stuartpstevens	709758283272290305	2016-03-15T15:08:56	Keep this between us. If it gets out, it's going to bankrupt media outlets feasting on the fat of dead campaigns.

stuartpstevens	709747464924954626	2016-03-15T14:25:56	Yes, because he takes all the delegates out of NY &amp; NJ. That's done. Assuming he wins FL. &amp; Ca. is reasonable split. 
stuartpstevens	709747028545433601	2016-03-15T14:24:12	Only number matters: 1237. No one has a shot to reach it but DT. How best to keep his number lowest? That's it. 
stuartpstevens	709746120860295168	2016-03-15T14:20:36	In 1 on 1, If TC wins &amp; takes 55% of del. to DT 45%, that's better for DT than DT winning &amp; getting 40% in 3/4 way. 
stuartpstevens	709744845418532864	2016-03-15T14:15:32	If Cruz beats Trump 1 on 1 in votes left, he likely still loses. Trump gets to 1237 faster in 2 way even losing.

stuartpstevens	708139012477718529	2016-03-11T03:54:31	Let me get this straight. A Fifth Avenue trust funder who's spent decades trolling for models is exaggerating? 
stuartpstevens	708136319046713344	2016-03-11T03:43:49	We've never had a presidential candidate with less knowledge and respect for Constitution than realDonaldTrump.  
stuartpstevens	708135456723091457	2016-03-11T03:40:24	Really disappointing that Tapper asked Trump about violence at his rallies but refused to ask him why his top staff are part of it.
stuartpstevens	708135461097570304	2016-03-11T03:40:25	Ronald Reagan challenged tyranny. From China to Russia, realDonaldTrump praises tyranny. Trump is the anti-Reagan. 
stuartpstevens	708134670223876097	2016-03-11T03:37:16	This is what it takes to handle female reporters.  
stuartpstevens	708132256028631040	2016-03-11T03:27:40	Coward.  
stuartpstevens	708130849162530816	2016-03-11T03:22:05	Can someone ask realDonaldTrump where US Embassy in Israel is located?
stuartpstevens	708119652120076288	2016-03-11T02:37:35	The entire Republican world is fed up with deals. So let's go with guy who wrote (sort of) "The Art Of The Deal." Makes sense.
stuartpstevens	708080562930585600	2016-03-11T00:02:16	If realDonaldTrump keeps CLewandowski_ ,he's approving of this behavior. It's not complicated.  
stuartpstevens	708079152239415296	2016-03-10T23:56:40	Much appreciated. Have you had a chance to see wonderful William Winter documentary:   
stuartpstevens	708022330732191745	2016-03-10T20:10:52	Does Trump campaign demand the non-Breitbart reporters ID themselves? Say a yellow star?  
stuartpstevens	707961867918909440	2016-03-10T16:10:37	Yeah, but look how that worked out.  
stuartpstevens	707960892705509376	2016-03-10T16:06:44	And this is before  realDonaldTrump released a single tax return. If he's using depreciation to pay zero fed taxes? 
stuartpstevens	707931618342674442	2016-03-10T14:10:25	I don't really believe BernieSanders has met any of the Minutemen border guys, but if it happens, can someone please periscopeco?

stuartpstevens	707807600038027264	2016-03-10T05:57:36	What can you say?  
stuartpstevens	707806183575388161	2016-03-10T05:51:59	That's not staff, that's an Administration. How many does it take to remind candidate  of deeply held beliefs?  
stuartpstevens	707802335762915329	2016-03-10T05:36:41	The SS hates it when campaign workers try to play tough security. Hate it. It never ends well.

stuartpstevens	707793860475428866	2016-03-10T05:03:01	Understood. It's a great point.  
stuartpstevens	707793268239687680	2016-03-10T05:00:39	That's one of the reasons I like Sweden so much. Everybody speaks English.

stuartpstevens	707792203431723009	2016-03-10T04:56:26	I'm not really against changing policy. But seems flawed to posit funding Castro would have helped human rights. 
stuartpstevens	707791429855256576	2016-03-10T04:53:21	No. I think both are terrible Faustian bargains, particularly Saudi. But that's not an argument for Cuba, is it?  
stuartpstevens	707790830938025986	2016-03-10T04:50:58	This is like looking at a lung X-Ray of a four pack a day 70 year old smoker.  
stuartpstevens	707789370808528896	2016-03-10T04:45:10	Longer conversation but idea of US corporations funding Castro for corporate profit is morally bankrupt.

stuartpstevens	707778130165891072	2016-03-10T04:00:30	Looks like BuzzFeed is really trying to help BernieSanders 
stuartpstevens	707774346920660992	2016-03-10T03:45:28	But well catered.

stuartpstevens	706654944967925760	2016-03-07T01:37:22	Man, if this thing gets tight, will be interesting to find out who BernieSanders killed. 
stuartpstevens	706344167593607168	2016-03-06T05:02:27	Big secret of the GOP race is that Trump isn't actually that far ahead. Trump 34.4% of votes so far, Cruz 28.6%. 
stuartpstevens	706339287911043072	2016-03-06T04:43:04	Missing "The Season." 
stuartpstevens	706338413620936709	2016-03-06T04:39:35	And does realDonaldTrump expect to improve relations with Canada by interacting with Prime Minister Poutine? 
stuartpstevens	706337491805216768	2016-03-06T04:35:55	Clarke clearly should run Convention! 
stuartpstevens	706336995950403584	2016-03-06T04:33:57	Would someone please ask realDonaldTrump what his winning nomination might mean for Tenth Amendment?
stuartpstevens	706336177515839488	2016-03-06T04:30:42	If it's good enough for Reagan to try and beat a sitting Republican POTUS, good enough to beat a major Clinton donor 
stuartpstevens	706335416627105792	2016-03-06T04:27:41	Everybody should start referring to this as the "Reagan Strategy" not a brokered convention.  
stuartpstevens	706334711640096768	2016-03-06T04:24:52	I'm getting to a point that if realDonaldTrump coverage doesn't include Marla Maples, it's just tiresome.
stuartpstevens	706333965276286976	2016-03-06T04:21:55	Did they mention a country?A year?  
stuartpstevens	706332923562217472	2016-03-06T04:17:46	$ 
stuartpstevens	706332657823694848	2016-03-06T04:16:43	I'm going to start a rumor that Cruz stole Kansas just to watch him go all Colonel Kurtz.  
stuartpstevens	706330881863110656	2016-03-06T04:09:39	Oh, I'm with you; why only 23% think country in right direction. I just think Trump is unstable, damaged nut.  
stuartpstevens	706329497075916800	2016-03-06T04:04:09	One campaign with resources deciding they have to beat Trump to win. That is only happening now.  
stuartpstevens	706328581417377794	2016-03-06T04:00:31	Yes but Obama drew larger crowds combined with real campaign. Trump greatly aided by lack of sustained attack.  
stuartpstevens	706327749338779648	2016-03-06T03:57:13	Here's a little thing I wrote about what success of Bernie may be telling us.  
stuartpstevens	706327005185310720	2016-03-06T03:54:15	Crushed, if nominee. Road kill.  
stuartpstevens	706326783700934656	2016-03-06T03:53:22	I don't disagree. But strikes me Trump has overshadowed lessons of  Sanders. I suspect may mean more in long run. 
stuartpstevens	706324642122883074	2016-03-06T03:44:52	I hadn't read this. It's really amazing.  
stuartpstevens	706323952302493697	2016-03-06T03:42:07	So true. In what turned out to be his last year, he was extraordinarily generous and kind to me. Such a man.  
stuartpstevens	706323319818215424	2016-03-06T03:39:36	I'm pro-stress.   
stuartpstevens	706322354679447552	2016-03-06T03:35:46	Economic  pressure. Very few at Trump or Sanders rallies not feeling economic stress. And that's huge universe. 
stuartpstevens	706321460068032513	2016-03-06T03:32:13	Ain't it the truth. The pain of losing is always far more than the pleasure of winning.  
stuartpstevens	706321122380357632	2016-03-06T03:30:53	Think there is a lot of truth in this.  
stuartpstevens	706320841869500416	2016-03-06T03:29:46	Big JohnCassidy fan but when Socialist is taking on Dem power structure, something not party specific is happening. 
stuartpstevens	706318708600381440	2016-03-06T03:21:17	"I don't want nothing else to do with Afghanistan." Crazy mattaikins longreads about corruption. 
stuartpstevens	706319078248615937	2016-03-06T03:22:45	FWIW, I'd say 19 hours, 6/7 days a week for year out is norm for us. To keep at it,have to be obsessed with winning. 
stuartpstevens	706311819116335104	2016-03-06T02:53:54	Clearly something different about election day votes vs early ones. Election day votes show Cruz surging, Trump off some, Rubio way off.
stuartpstevens	706316805174861824	2016-03-06T03:13:43	I'm open to the truth depending on how it test.  
stuartpstevens	706316109629235200	2016-03-06T03:10:57	But made great chapter in "Marathon." Just idea that it is somehow invalid countered by RR's use. Against a POTUS. 
stuartpstevens	706314512044007426	2016-03-06T03:04:37	On my tombstone I'm putting, "The Internals Looked Better." 
stuartpstevens	706314206166048769	2016-03-06T03:03:24	This seems dead right to me. For all this negativity about convention decision, it became Reagan's 1976 strategy.  
stuartpstevens	706312728558829568	2016-03-06T02:57:31	It's La. Make that lap the beermile 
stuartpstevens	706312086666739713	2016-03-06T02:54:58	This is huge. Fortunately for Rubio, he has @rich_beeson, who is master at this early stuff.  
stuartpstevens	706311248900702208	2016-03-06T02:51:39	In a world trying to avoid "Guns of August" outcome, Cruz would let Rubio have clear shot. But off to Somme we go. 
stuartpstevens	706309381126758400	2016-03-06T02:44:13	Yep. Do you see Cruz with shot to win FL?  
stuartpstevens	706308747178725376	2016-03-06T02:41:42	As you and I remember too well, "Florida, Florida, Florida."  
stuartpstevens	706300848339623936	2016-03-06T02:10:19	This is proof realDonaldTrump is having a rough night.  
stuartpstevens	706299865840664578	2016-03-06T02:06:25	ron_fournier realDonaldTrump 
stuartpstevens	706299006805217280	2016-03-06T02:03:00	That it takes a press statement by realDonaldTrump to assert he won't violate oath of office says it all.  
stuartpstevens	706296319598579712	2016-03-06T01:52:19	Once had client thank donors &amp; God, in that order, after win. Later insisted proper as only proof donors maxed out. 
stuartpstevens	706293371363528707	2016-03-06T01:40:36	Man, you're enjoying that more than maddow 
stuartpstevens	706292937240551428	2016-03-06T01:38:53	It's the little things... 
stuartpstevens	706292371944820736	2016-03-06T01:36:38	Uh, we did President Bush in 2000 &amp; 2004. Wrote a book about it:  
stuartpstevens	706291661786234882	2016-03-06T01:33:49	Republican Senate candidates can stand on same stage with Cruz. Most in tight races can't with Trump.  
stuartpstevens	706291300820193280	2016-03-06T01:32:23	Ahhh...that Cruz-Sanders Kansas.  
stuartpstevens	706290324424024064	2016-03-06T01:28:30	Well, an anti-Castro Cuban must be troubling in this great era of Cuban renaissance.  
stuartpstevens	706288277196828672	2016-03-06T01:20:22	They have tons of people who aren't ripped from cover of "Picture of Dorian Gray." Lady Gaga is pretty great. 
stuartpstevens	706286995325243393	2016-03-06T01:15:16	The guy was a creep when he was paid to hate HillaryClinton. Now that he's paid to hate for her, he's still a creep 
stuartpstevens	706285375115935744	2016-03-06T01:08:50	The HillaryClinton campaign has a lot of appealing supporters. Why do they allow davidbrockdc to be out front? 
stuartpstevens	706284162165170176	2016-03-06T01:04:01	When you did this sort of thing in Cub Scouts, it was usually followed by cookies.  
stuartpstevens	706283679174270976	2016-03-06T01:02:05	ChrisChristie beat incumbent governor who outspent him 10 to 1 in deep blue state. He ran a hell of a race.  
stuartpstevens	706282792246763520	2016-03-06T00:58:34	Very smart move for MSNBC to bring on rickwtyler. Instant depth of knowledge on R side &amp; great tone.
stuartpstevens	706269750523858944	2016-03-06T00:06:45	No problem taking blame for 2012. Said it before. For more on firm's record, Strat_Media  
stuartpstevens	706267809295179776	2016-03-05T23:59:02	Pretty sure realDonaldTrump knows more about "The Season" than "The Movement."  
stuartpstevens	706266565533048832	2016-03-05T23:54:05	Man, I'd go with senatormcdaniel over Trump. I think he understands &amp; respects the role of Constitution.  
stuartpstevens	706261167568715776	2016-03-05T23:32:38	Once you use a POTUS debate to defend your penis &amp; attack the constitution, hard to say anyone else was made a fool. 
stuartpstevens	706258151977435137	2016-03-05T23:20:39	We lost a special spirit today with Pat Conroy's death. One of the great ones, huge heart &amp; talent. His generosity meant the world to me.
stuartpstevens	706252112343207936	2016-03-05T22:56:39	I'm sure it will be artisan bread.  
stuartpstevens	706234442881302528	2016-03-05T21:46:27	Be funny if Mexico paid for it. RT FiveThirtyEight: The Midwest is on the verge of forming an anti-Trump wall: 
stuartpstevens	706251195699040256	2016-03-05T22:53:01	But did they say who'd they vote for?  
stuartpstevens	706238698782720000	2016-03-05T22:03:21	To recap: Trump left CPAC2016 (where he lost straw poll) to Kansas, where he lost.
stuartpstevens	706137469939552256	2016-03-05T15:21:06	Puzzled: HillaryClinton took $100k from Trump. Used to pay political consultants. Should she remain silent?  
stuartpstevens	706124894547750913	2016-03-05T14:31:08	Sounds reasonable. 
stuartpstevens	706124539910983681	2016-03-05T14:29:44	If realDonaldTrump is Republican nominee it will be good evidence God is a woman &amp; has endorsed Clinton.  
stuartpstevens	706120937406603264	2016-03-05T14:15:25	The unique horror of Donald Trump's foreign policy and why I signed a letter opposing it 
stuartpstevens	706122617577558017	2016-03-05T14:22:05	Let's start with First Amendment, then Second, then...this is why realDonaldTrump movement is anti-conservative. 
stuartpstevens	706122074096427008	2016-03-05T14:19:56	Let the realDonaldTrump reign trials begin.  
stuartpstevens	706004732523970561	2016-03-05T06:33:39	Putz not puts.  
stuartpstevens	706004176623501314	2016-03-05T06:31:27	Well, this is one way to save a lot of time.  
stuartpstevens	705091323158724608	2016-03-02T18:04:06	Trump: Ryan will get along or 'pay a big price' . So, any doubt that we're dealing with an extra-Constitutional thug?
stuartpstevens	705473622765338624	2016-03-03T19:23:13	AnotherTrumpSupporter.  Really striking how much of the pushback on our letter comes from anti-Semites.  
stuartpstevens	705746617337520128	2016-03-04T13:28:00	R's wondering about whether to confront Trump, consider the Duke in STAGECOACH: "Well, there's some things a man just can't run away from."
stuartpstevens	705754850320117760	2016-03-04T14:00:43	Open Letter on Trump from GOP National Security Leaders 
stuartpstevens	704979500434661376	2016-03-02T10:39:45	R's accepting Trump remember Churchill 1938: "You were offered the choice between dishonor and war. You chose dishonor, you will have war."
stuartpstevens	705998392179216385	2016-03-05T06:08:28	I agree that is most likely outcome. Hope not but we'll see.  
stuartpstevens	705994392360914944	2016-03-05T05:52:34	Democratic, 1968. In the divide.  
stuartpstevens	705993639684677632	2016-03-05T05:49:35	Respect that. Just completely disagree for many reasons.  
stuartpstevens	705993333928271872	2016-03-05T05:48:22	I think if Trump is nominee, there will be strong conservative third party. 
stuartpstevens	705992693739081728	2016-03-05T05:45:49	Can't take trash  talk seriously off the field. I laughed. We go back. 
stuartpstevens	705992017935994880	2016-03-05T05:43:08	Close. But no one was going off about "will of the people." It's just who has delegates by rules. 
stuartpstevens	705952741059903489	2016-03-05T03:07:04	How far in the tank is seanhannity? His "special show from CPAC2016" has an interview with Trump, only candidate who bailed on the event.
stuartpstevens	705991294120812544	2016-03-05T05:40:15	If someone beats Trump at convention, they surely will get behind winner. Trump is all about winning, no?  
stuartpstevens	705989335963848705	2016-03-05T05:32:28	Hey BBennett152, good to see you on megynkelly. Not a Trump guy but best of luck to you.
stuartpstevens	705988324960423936	2016-03-05T05:28:27	Everybody talking about how terrible it might be for Cruz, Rubio or Kasich to win at Convention - that was Reagan's strategy in 1976.
stuartpstevens	705987272030732289	2016-03-05T05:24:16	That's what the anti-NRA crowd say about the Second Amendment. 
stuartpstevens	705986364509196288	2016-03-05T05:20:40	First ballot. 
stuartpstevens	705985894122127360	2016-03-05T05:18:48	Let me help: "God, please don't run, Mitt. " Otherwise you're asking God not to run or for God not to run Mitt. 
stuartpstevens	705983344518021120	2016-03-05T05:08:40	As far as we know. 
stuartpstevens	705980224245211137	2016-03-05T04:56:16	Fed Funding prohibited candidates from raising money once accepted. And imposed limits. Still a plus I think. 
stuartpstevens	705978599950655489	2016-03-05T04:49:49	Thank heavens there's a guy on his third wife young enough to be his daughter to defend traditional values.  
stuartpstevens	705977422274031616	2016-03-05T04:45:08	There is this odd homo-erotic thing with a lot of pro-Trump guys. That Trump's appeal?  
stuartpstevens	705963355320799232	2016-03-05T03:49:14	My mistake.You can appreciate winning through hard work as Sen Cochran did &amp; loser making wild allegations. Like Ia. 
stuartpstevens	705961658527707136	2016-03-05T03:42:30	I thought the whole religion of Trump was to worship winning? We won every race we did in 2014. 
stuartpstevens	705958432952553473	2016-03-05T03:29:41	Never easy choices. But I'd play best percentages. It will be a ticket with 2 of 3 non-Trump.  But DT can't win FL.  
stuartpstevens	705957579881467904	2016-03-05T03:26:17	I think realistically, short of unlikely Trump collapse, best shot is to take it to 2nd ballot, as rules specify. 
stuartpstevens	705956946994593794	2016-03-05T03:23:46	FWIW, my firm has helped elect more Rep senators &amp; governors than any firm plus both GWB races.  
stuartpstevens	705955906475859968	2016-03-05T03:19:38	Yes, it's an opinion. I respect others who disagree &amp; many do. But it's my view. 
stuartpstevens	705955625730052096	2016-03-05T03:18:31	How?  
stuartpstevens	705955275644104704	2016-03-05T03:17:08	Well, I agree with that. Absolutely. 
stuartpstevens	705954483369455616	2016-03-05T03:13:59	Just run numbers. How does Cruz get to 1237? Seems his best shot is keeping Trump under &amp; 2nd ballot. That's doable. 
stuartpstevens	705953293915152385	2016-03-05T03:09:15	If it's a two person race, how does Cruz realistically win?  
stuartpstevens	705945579394699264	2016-03-05T02:38:36	I love that instinct but where was it in Sept? The numbers aren't there. He's helping Trump, by design or not.  
stuartpstevens	705944168363732993	2016-03-05T02:33:00	But the race is simple numbers. Is Cruz going to win Fla? If Trump wins, very bad for Cruz's chance.  
stuartpstevens	705943073147097088	2016-03-05T02:28:39	I'd say current path Cruz is taking makes this seem more likely. 
stuartpstevens	705941963061637120	2016-03-05T02:24:14	This is crazy. A variation of his cozying up to Trump for months. This is a gift to realDonaldTrump.  
stuartpstevens	705936937853452288	2016-03-05T02:04:16	This is extraordinary. BenSasse 
stuartpstevens	705935444064624640	2016-03-05T01:58:20	It's all fun and games until a thug like this gets near Oval Office.  
stuartpstevens	705935033857495040	2016-03-05T01:56:42	Guys like realDonaldTrump  - and they are all over NYC/Palm Beach - try hard to believe it's not just their money.  
stuartpstevens	705934131226513408	2016-03-05T01:53:07	Oh, can a reporter please ask realDonaldTrump what years these two presidents served?  
stuartpstevens	705933783128608768	2016-03-05T01:51:44	This is probably why the first two wives divorced him. Can you imagine having a lunatic like this around the house? 
stuartpstevens	705927986420314113	2016-03-05T01:28:42	This is a must read: jacobwe on Donald Trump's very American fascism. Not a bad dream, but a very real nightmare. 
stuartpstevens	705920750562095104	2016-03-05T00:59:56	Don't think possible given 1st Amendment.  
stuartpstevens	705904465442897924	2016-03-04T23:55:14	Trump cancelled CPAC because he was afraid of Q&amp;A. Weak! 
stuartpstevens	705919312154890240	2016-03-05T00:54:14	That's been ruled violation of free speech by Supreme Court. But every nominee stayed in until Obama.

stuartpstevens	705245733226729477	2016-03-03T04:17:40	I get and respect that instinct. I'm sort of the same way. Just think Trump is dangerous and a bigot. 
stuartpstevens	705244367079010304	2016-03-03T04:12:14	Seems relevant that guy who says he will get Mexicans to pay for $10b wall couldn't get them to pay for $100k condos

stuartpstevens	705224071924027392	2016-03-03T02:51:35	Yes, the anti-Trump vote which is between 70 to 60% of the voters.

stuartpstevens	705220156742623237	2016-03-03T02:36:02	That is not true of anyone supporting any candidate. Including the Obama staffers who savaged Clinton &amp; now with her

stuartpstevens	705217599190257664	2016-03-03T02:25:52	Well,hard to look at two candidates on Dem side debating who did what in 1960's &amp; not ask, "318m &amp; this is it?"  
stuartpstevens	705217034523709440	2016-03-03T02:23:37	See? That's how it starts. For a Southerner, the Civil War can be the same. Once you start obsessing, hard to stop. 
stuartpstevens	705216422717292544	2016-03-03T02:21:12	Because Trump is such a nut he's losing to an obscure socialist from a tiny state.

stuartpstevens	705211212674547712	2016-03-03T02:00:29	Idea that increased primary turn-out bodes well for Nov? Trump getting way under 50%. So more turning out to vote against him. That's good?
stuartpstevens	705209823835660288	2016-03-03T01:54:58	A ridiculing of efforts to oppose Trump is a not very clever ploy to say that all Republicans are Trump.

stuartpstevens	705207605908664324	2016-03-03T01:46:10	But now Trump seen as useful to elect Clinton, so it shifts. Not a first for either side but Trump more dangerous.  
stuartpstevens	705206791433535489	2016-03-03T01:42:55	On CNN. It's a growing trope. NewRepublic praising Trump too. So much for this pretense of country over politics. 
stuartpstevens	705204125303246848	2016-03-03T01:32:20	The degree to which left like KatrinaNation embrace Trump is shameful.

stuartpstevens	705165211217457152	2016-03-02T22:57:42	Under this logic, a primary vote for Clinton is pro-Trump since Sanders does better against him than Clinton.

stuartpstevens	705160206129324032	2016-03-02T22:37:49	In a handful of tweets, you've been more specific than Trump. And knowledgeable. What is it he'll do?  
stuartpstevens	705159762669731840	2016-03-02T22:36:03	Fine. Trump is running for president. What's his positions on these?

stuartpstevens	705155094124347393	2016-03-02T22:17:30	No. There will likely be a conservative third party candidate who isn't a bigot.

stuartpstevens	705152224926814208	2016-03-02T22:06:06	It is so petty and partisan to play games praising Trump to help Clinton. Sort of mocks any real concern for country
