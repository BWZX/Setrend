CL_fTrader	722655880840364032	2016-04-20T05:19:22	These interviews really break down what sort of value you can genuinely provide. The bluntness of it all is simply rewarding.
CL_fTrader	722655603710107649	2016-04-20T05:18:16	So happy to go in for another interview. Whether I get the position is up to many factors, portion of which are completely out of my control
CL_fTrader	722487606118850560	2016-04-19T18:10:43	This was only about 3 minutes of the 47 minute interview. I liked the interview because it taught me a lot about what I have actually done
