AnthonyCrudele	717709296075730944	2016-04-06T13:43:25	CL_F has been weaker than ES_F over past week so rallies in CL are less significant as ES has stayed bid
AnthonyCrudele	717708050287763457	2016-04-06T13:38:28	As long as Gold continues to strengthen this morning, I dont see a big move higher in ES_F even w/ CL_F being strong
AnthonyCrudele	717706878646673408	2016-04-06T13:33:48	With today being FOMC minutes I expect some choppiness in ES_F along w/ randomness with correlations  Gold CL_F

AnthonyCrudele	694908320428068864	2016-02-03T15:40:29	AnthonyCrudele I enjoy your analysis
AnthonyCrudele	694907635464855552	2016-02-03T15:37:45	ES_F hit our support at 1865;cld see decent bounce if ZN_F fails at 130'26; hourly close below 1865 is really ugly 
AnthonyCrudele	694906605683503109	2016-02-03T15:33:40	ZN_F resistance at 130'26; unless I have multiple short term confirmations I wouldnt step in front of this thing 
AnthonyCrudele	694905845377822720	2016-02-03T15:30:38	oh boy.. big builds in CL_F here comes 1865 in ES_F
AnthonyCrudele	694903513898442753	2016-02-03T15:21:23	CL_F data in 10 min...Even if they get a pop on data &amp; ES_F bounces, I think that becomes a short opportunity for ES down to 1865
AnthonyCrudele	694899859988615168	2016-02-03T15:06:51	CL_F not the main driver of ES_F its all about Treasuries right now ZN_F
AnthonyCrudele	694899456370700288	2016-02-03T15:05:15	this ZN_F move is nuts; IMO this is the big reason  ES_F is getting hit
AnthonyCrudele	694899120671232000	2016-02-03T15:03:55	ES_F failing at 1911 was key for bears; now an hourly close below 1892 puts 1865 into play today

AnthonyCrudele	692368854694109185	2016-01-27T15:29:33	CL should be interesting as the 11.4m build yesterday could have a huge build baked in.  i.e a small build could be very bullish
