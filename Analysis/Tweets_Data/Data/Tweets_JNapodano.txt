JNapodano	694577285907767296	2016-02-02T17:45:04	vigkap ACAD already discussed this issue with the agency at a Type-C meeting. Here‚Äôs what I said in April 2013 &gt;&gt; 
JNapodano	694574894227525632	2016-02-02T17:35:34	adamfeuerstein That would actually be a good tool to put together, BS vs. SS numbers. I wonder if ISI does that.
JNapodano	694574433411923970	2016-02-02T17:33:44	esimian In their defense, they figured no need for Plan-B because Plan-A was the largest aspirin supplier in the world‚Ä¶ at the time.
JNapodano	694574092402450436	2016-02-02T17:32:22	adamfeuerstein Is there somewhere buy-siders post models or are you saying the buy-side consensus is lower based on a few samples calls?
JNapodano	694570471933763584	2016-02-02T17:17:59	esimian I think they were mislead on the severity of the infractions at the API supplier #1. However, they should have moved on #2 earlier.
JNapodano	694561526196355077	2016-02-02T16:42:26	brianjlarsen Going to guess diagnosis. I bet the real incidence numbers are much higher but the actual diagnosis of gastric cancer is low.
