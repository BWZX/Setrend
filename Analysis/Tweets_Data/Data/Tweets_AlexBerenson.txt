AlexBerenson	711295407817662465	2016-03-19T20:56:55	.hblodget a verdict that big is no accident. It's a sign that Gawker's behavior disgusted the jury.
AlexBerenson	711280233937248257	2016-03-19T19:56:37	Duke = the worst 
AlexBerenson	711275530197344256	2016-03-19T19:37:55	dukeyale is making Hogan v. Gawker look like a nailbiter...
AlexBerenson	711247293782036481	2016-03-19T17:45:43	Wmboot sure. gawker's defense. Jury looked at the totality of the facts and gawker's general attitude to privacy and disagreed.
AlexBerenson	711240798508032000	2016-03-19T17:19:55	Remember - HH didn't claim defamation. He claimed a violation of privacy. And what's more private than consensual sex?
AlexBerenson	711240461634183168	2016-03-19T17:18:34	NoceraNYT it's wrong on the law, wrong on the facts, and it turns off reasonable people.
AlexBerenson	711240351898591232	2016-03-19T17:18:08	NoceraNYT I know journos want to protect the 1st but this is like the NRA saying no new gun laws after a school massacre...
AlexBerenson	711239754352824320	2016-03-19T17:15:46	.NoceraNYT no slope here. gawker threw itself off a cliff.
AlexBerenson	711239343751438338	2016-03-19T17:14:08	.Penenberg exactly right. why so many journos are having trouble getting this verdict is beyond me. it isn't even close.
AlexBerenson	711237552955641856	2016-03-19T17:07:01	.sethmnookin .NoceraNYT any more than the 2nd gives me a right to own a tank.
AlexBerenson	711237224550035456	2016-03-19T17:05:43	.sethmnookin .NoceraNYT it doesn't protect falsehoods. or the right to publish photos of people having sex taken without their consent...
AlexBerenson	711236603591696384	2016-03-19T17:03:15	.sethmnookin ,NoceraNYT you're seriously confused about the 1st. it doesn't mean anyone can publish anything anytime.
AlexBerenson	711031429308751872	2016-03-19T03:27:57	felixsalmon your elitism is sneaking out. juries decide stuff way more important than this. like capital punishment.
AlexBerenson	711031115063099392	2016-03-19T03:26:42	felixsalmon so a person has no ownership interest in a sex tape of him made without his knowledge? have fun with that defense.
AlexBerenson	711030215871488005	2016-03-19T03:23:08	.felixsalmon it does mean that Gawker is up in smoke. and to that i say, huzzah.
AlexBerenson	711030111265558529	2016-03-19T03:22:43	felixsalmon the gawker defense that HH doesn't deserve privacy may be reasonable. but a jury said no. doesn't mean the 1st is up in smoke.
AlexBerenson	711029756943273984	2016-03-19T03:21:19	felixsalmon so you admit he'd have a tort. he's got a tort here too: invasion of privacy. not defamation, not slander.
AlexBerenson	711028600238153728	2016-03-19T03:16:43	felixsalmon say gawker rented a theater to screen the video, charged $10 to see it, didn't stop when HH asked. would that be protected?
AlexBerenson	711024942511493121	2016-03-19T03:02:11	felixsalmon ask a media lawyer if the truth is actually an absolute defense. you may be surprised at the answer.
AlexBerenson	711023208103804928	2016-03-19T02:55:17	felixsalmon no. twitter straw man. What gawker did in this case may not be covered. What gawker does as a rule is slop.
AlexBerenson	711022840913534976	2016-03-19T02:53:50	felixsalmon exactly.  see next tweet.
AlexBerenson	711022723804372992	2016-03-19T02:53:22	Of course not, right? The 1st Amendment doesn't protect libel/slander. It has limits. And a jury reasonably decided gawker breached 'em.
AlexBerenson	711022165009813505	2016-03-19T02:51:08	.felixsalmon 1st Amendment absolutists: What if Gawker had said Hulk raped kids? Would that be protected too?
AlexBerenson	711019605117026304	2016-03-19T02:40:58	felixsalmon I wasn't aware that Congress voted on this verdict. First Amendment is very, very powerful, Felix. But it's not absolute.
AlexBerenson	711016732387840000	2016-03-19T02:29:33	felixsalmon And by the way, I'm not a "media type." I was an investigative reporter. Thus I know the difference between real work and slop.
AlexBerenson	711016548153036800	2016-03-19T02:28:49	felixsalmon Felix, I love you, but that's the strangest non-threat ever. Please put me on your enemies list...

AlexBerenson	696499573599043585	2016-02-08T01:03:33	And as I tweeted...
AlexBerenson	696499384033214464	2016-02-08T01:02:48	Denver may somehow scrape out a win but Peyton Manning will still be 1-3 in Super Bowls

AlexBerenson	686585389562355713	2016-01-11T16:28:07	adamfeuerstein so this is what a biotech bear market feels like. Ouch. The good and the bad blown up side by side.
AlexBerenson	686158262098604032	2016-01-10T12:10:52	bradloncar any reason to think JPM16 breaks the downward momentum?
AlexBerenson	685475426785976320	2016-01-08T14:57:31	Let's see: solid job growth, low inflation, cheap oil, low rates, moderate deficit. Yeah, I see why the markets are spooked.

AlexBerenson	685216084945956864	2016-01-07T21:47:00	psuvafan007 bradloncar jq1234t Maybe related to the failure to lock up the SF gene pre-P1?

AlexBerenson	685115567225856001	2016-01-07T15:07:34	AdamSinger bradloncar my bold prediction (which didn't feel bold two hours ago): qure ends the day &gt;18
AlexBerenson	685112399444185088	2016-01-07T14:54:59	princetongb agree they should wait. They've now shown + results in 3 diseases. I know WS hates GT now but sooner or later it'll notice.
AlexBerenson	685111226934931456	2016-01-07T14:50:19	princetongb from what I can see they have plenty of cash thanks to last year's raise and BMY deal
AlexBerenson	685110681570512896	2016-01-07T14:48:09	princetongb agree, but the data is what it is. And eventually that must matter...
AlexBerenson	685108437345284096	2016-01-07T14:39:14	bradloncar AdamSinger or maybe not. This is some lousy market. Great results get you all the way back to... Monday.
AlexBerenson	685065118208638976	2016-01-07T11:47:06	bradloncar you were right in Oct. on$blue (and I was wrong), wrong on this. No need to poor-mouth the data...
AlexBerenson	685064127765712896	2016-01-07T11:43:10	bradloncar this is a 49-3 win
AlexBerenson	685059455218769920	2016-01-07T11:24:36	princetongb that sounds about right.  Hard to say this shouldn't have an EV ex-cash close to blue
AlexBerenson	685057588292128768	2016-01-07T11:17:11	princetongb yes, very hard to nitpick. Liver enzymes, I guess. But even that was minor. Next question: where do we open?

AlexBerenson	685054090628431872	2016-01-07T11:03:17	That's a win 
AlexBerenson	684872158271647745	2016-01-06T23:00:21	adamfeuerstein psuvafan007 don't know what we see in AM but at 1.5x cash with BMY etc, risk is &lt;20%, upside 20-125%. I'll take that bet.
AlexBerenson	684732550766538752	2016-01-06T13:45:36	hughhewitt NateSilver538 really? I found it insipid. Esp. compared to the sharp TheAtlantic piece two weeks ago.
AlexBerenson	684523364204044288	2016-01-05T23:54:22	In retrospect - and even at the time - paying $1B for that ridiculous female libido drug was the last act

AlexBerenson	684451082404245508	2016-01-05T19:07:09	DrMedicalValue princetongb blue gets far more respect. qure ex-cash has a cap of 160M. Have to own it at that price.
AlexBerenson	684449796577464320	2016-01-05T19:02:02	princetongb by holding it they just encourage leaks and games with the stock.
AlexBerenson	684449621347794944	2016-01-05T19:01:20	princetongb I dislike the game qure is playing with the FIX data. No conference embargo and it's market-moving info. Release it.
AlexBerenson	683756333917683712	2016-01-03T21:06:28	MattGoldstein26 ouch
AlexBerenson	683755240726892546	2016-01-03T21:02:07	MattGoldstein26 yes, I jest

AlexBerenson	683751654924091393	2016-01-03T20:47:52	MattGoldstein26 this drive for the season
AlexBerenson	683749004337922048	2016-01-03T20:37:20	MattGoldstein26 hugely disagree. Playoff teams grit out these games. They did in Dallas and they will today. Even after that INT.
AlexBerenson	683746890945544192	2016-01-03T20:28:56	srubenfeld MattGoldstein26 I thought not

AlexBerenson	682402666153160704	2015-12-31T03:27:28	princetongb I see your issues... They haven't guided at all on Pasteur. What's likely? 50/50 split? License and mid-teens royalty?
AlexBerenson	682329605794086912	2015-12-30T22:37:09	princetongb DrMedicalValue The IP/royalty fight must be very messy. Tho I presume it'll get sorted.
AlexBerenson	682317814854737920	2015-12-30T21:50:18	princetongb DrMedicalValue all legit points. The delay in taking sponsorship of the SF program puzzles me too.

AlexBerenson	682280292191698944	2015-12-30T19:21:12	psuvafan007 DrMedicalValue far better to come in after as savior (and get options on cheap). But we will see.

AlexBerenson	682216744195342336	2015-12-30T15:08:41	DrMedicalValue princetongb forget FIX. It trades at 1.6x cash with big pharma backing and the SF data.
