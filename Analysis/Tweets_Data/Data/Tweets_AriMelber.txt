AriMelber	720683417852059648	2016-04-14T18:41:31	Legally, the key to this decision is the prosecutor gave deference to Lewandowski on par with law enforcement: 
AriMelber	720682878363897857	2016-04-14T18:39:22	Prosecutor's no file summary:

AriMelber	720677613581307904	2016-04-14T18:18:27	Prosecutor: Trump personally called and spoke with several people in our office, told his story and urged us "to do the right thing."
AriMelber	720676237384003584	2016-04-14T18:12:59	Prosecutor: I know Lewandowski's team wrote a draft apology to Fields this week

AriMelber	720675748927926273	2016-04-14T18:11:02	On the law, this prosecutor is offering a fairly strong exoneration of Lewandowski.  On the facts, he still suggests Lewandowski lied.
AriMelber	720675369804804096	2016-04-14T18:09:32	Prosecutors also say they met with Lewandowski's attorney about his view of the case.

AriMelber	720633640586256384	2016-04-14T15:23:43	billscher fair, popular vote is a huge stick, but if convention is empowered to do a run-off, that = not automatically endorsing plurality
AriMelber	720632074953068544	2016-04-14T15:17:30	ha thank you!  
AriMelber	720630120457838593	2016-04-14T15:09:44	I trust that many well adjusted, non-delegate obsessed people have already unsubscribed... which I totally get 
AriMelber	720629740751732736	2016-04-14T15:08:13	So, those were the points on rules, the campaign wrangling and our reporting. Sorry I went full Kanye tweetstorm on delegates AGAIN.
AriMelber	720629486446886912	2016-04-14T15:07:12	So there's a theory that Trump doesn't get rules and is "freaking out."  Or maybe he gets that an open convention = big risk of losing nom.
AriMelber	720629141570207744	2016-04-14T15:05:50	If convention goes to later balloting, delegates are free &amp; remember, ONLY 37% of all GOP voters have backed Trump.  
AriMelber	720628600211382272	2016-04-14T15:03:41	Former W. strategist re GOP superdelegates:  
AriMelber	720628253258551296	2016-04-14T15:02:18	That's why Cruz has a Wedding Crashers strategy - First, asking delegates not to marry Trump  
AriMelber	720627917387141120	2016-04-14T15:00:58	And thwarting Trump on first ballot - when rules maximize his support - opens up later balloting when Trump delegates can walk.
AriMelber	720627663585558529	2016-04-14T14:59:58	Translation: If there are almost no unbound delegates left for Trump, then a Trump finish under 1,237 makes 1st ballot victory very hard.
AriMelber	720627433410596864	2016-04-14T14:59:03	But Cruz isn't just winning "Trojan delegates" for 2nd ballot- Manafort's complaint - he has unbound for 1st ballot 
AriMelber	720627106997141504	2016-04-14T14:57:45	and there's no reason to "over count" what Cruz might get at the convention - he has to prove it on first or later balloting (if open conv)
AriMelber	720626911936778240	2016-04-14T14:56:59	When you see media say Trump is up 200 delegates over Cruz - that doesn't always count his entire potential edge from ND, or Rubio delegates
AriMelber	720626569585274880	2016-04-14T14:55:37	So Trump and Cruz are separate by 211 delegates today, and there are at least 177 GOP "superdelegates" that can close that gap
AriMelber	720626186712387584	2016-04-14T14:54:06	And today we report another 34 GOP delegates unbound on 1st ballot from Rubio slots - up for grabs *right now*  
AriMelber	720625898957991936	2016-04-14T14:52:57	GOP now has about 143 unbound delegates from states that chose to give delegates more power than voters

AriMelber	714985149788733440	2016-03-30T01:18:38	It is unlikely Lewandowski's lawyers will make the maybe "pen" or "bomb" defense Trump just offered for him.

AriMelber	714921083548336128	2016-03-29T21:04:03	I need to learn Twitter  (good idea!) 
AriMelber	714919580779589634	2016-03-29T20:58:05	13) Trump defending Lewandowski by arguing mild contact, but charge is only misdemeanor battery - unwanted touching - not major violence
AriMelber	714911432165302273	2016-03-29T20:25:42	12) But again, in fairness, Lewandowski's lawyers have not made any threat defense - his boss is simply tweeting about it.
AriMelber	714911300745191424	2016-03-29T20:25:11	11) A "threat" defense is also very hard to make if reporter is known, invited and credentialed to be present at event.
AriMelber	714911108893573120	2016-03-29T20:24:25	10) Defense to misdemeanor battery like this more likely minimizing the interaction - not alleging Fields was a "threat," as Trump implies
AriMelber	714910763937193984	2016-03-29T20:23:03	9) Politically, Trump may want to talk about if he should "press charges" against Fields - Legally, prob unhelpful to Lewandowski defense.
AriMelber	714910498706169856	2016-03-29T20:21:59	8) But that is a challenge- Lewandowski's personal interest is in having his lawyers instruct Trump, his employer, how to discuss this case
AriMelber	714910219633987585	2016-03-29T20:20:53	7) That means as a legal matter, he can fight the charge and argue it should not impact his employment or life at all.
AriMelber	714910038351941632	2016-03-29T20:20:10	6) Voters make up their own minds about what's on video/ its relevance to 2016; legally, Lewandowski presumed innocent until proven guilty.
AriMelber	714909763046277120	2016-03-29T20:19:04	5) These are just initial challenges of having the leader of a campaign also navigating a private criminal matter in public eye.
AriMelber	714909559433723904	2016-03-29T20:18:16	4) Lewandowski wanted to speak out - witness announced O'Reilly intv tonight - &amp; he or lawyers reconsidered - intv "postponed" per Greta
AriMelber	714909301425319936	2016-03-29T20:17:14	3) Many defendants (understandably) want to speak out immediately - best legal strategy is usually initial silence by defendant.
AriMelber	714909073922109440	2016-03-29T20:16:20	2) Trump may be trying to help his manager, but his interests as a candidate may potentially diverge from manager's interests as a defendant

AriMelber	710875490706460673	2016-03-18T17:08:19	So when GOP delegates assertively fought Romney's rules in 2012, Boehner just used a voice vote to overrule them: 
AriMelber	710874677250539522	2016-03-18T17:05:05	..or if you wanna skip the long article, I talked through the rulemakers' views on contested conventions in 5 min: 
AriMelber	710873845339713536	2016-03-18T17:01:46	At any contested convention this summer, lots more riding on that kind of call, with Paul Ryan at the helm. 
AriMelber	710873607904366592	2016-03-18T17:00:50	Think about that: The rules for entire convention came down to one man deciding he heard the "ayes" have it. 
AriMelber	710873222984699905	2016-03-18T16:59:18	Boehner held a "voice vote" on Romney rules at 2012 convention - but his prompter showed YES VOTE was predetermined: 
AriMelber	710872463136186369	2016-03-18T16:56:17	A serious charge - but some RNC members/Paul supporters had some tangible evidence that Boehner and Romney had the fix in on a rules vote.
AriMelber	710872193014603777	2016-03-18T16:55:12	Many GOP rule-makers we interviewed brought up the 2012 Ron Paul example on their own, to argue the convention was managed improperly.
AriMelber	710871974726254592	2016-03-18T16:54:20	Now, ALL of that assumes that rules are fairly offered and voted on. What if there are attempts to violate rules or process at convention?

AriMelber	710871146636451841	2016-03-18T16:51:03	Interesting tweetstorm from AriMelber on RNC scenarios and rules. This talk will dominate next few months.
AriMelber	710871246741889024	2016-03-18T16:51:27	That GOP rules guru is Mort Blackwell, he's been on EVERY convention rules comt since '72. Says RNC messed this up 
AriMelber	710871041841766400	2016-03-18T16:50:38	One GOP rules guru said *now* any rule change is seen for who it benefits, not its neutral purpose.  So, more John Rawls than John Kasich.
AriMelber	710870677201420290	2016-03-18T16:49:11	8. So yes, RNC Convention can put Cruz on a ballot against Trump, or keep him off ballot. But some Rs think past rules offer a baseline
AriMelber	710870349479546880	2016-03-18T16:47:53	7. It's true that past rules don't bind next convention-but RNC members worry any rules that are "too" different could be seen as power grab
AriMelber	710869900378636289	2016-03-18T16:46:06	6.Trump has harshly upped the rhetoric, some RNC members are also blunt, saying "Democracy is not the way we do it." 
AriMelber	710868089278210048	2016-03-18T16:38:54	5. Other GOP rule-makers say the POINT of a convention is for delegates to pick if primaries didn't have a winner 
AriMelber	710867664655290368	2016-03-18T16:37:13	As one RNC member said: there's no "magic figure," but it's not good to stop Trump if he's up 300 delegates 
AriMelber	710867348635439104	2016-03-18T16:35:57	3. But not all leads are the same -- several RNC members uneasy about a process that stops Trump if he has big lead. 
AriMelber	710867219660591104	2016-03-18T16:35:27	2.Many RNC members say if Trump doesn't get delegate majority, they don't think they're "stopping" him, the rules dictate a convention vote

AriMelber	710124521215365120	2016-03-16T15:24:13	This announcement is unusual as it's more about how the Senate does its job than how this judge does his job.

AriMelber	710121528260698116	2016-03-16T15:12:20	Raising the question, how high? 
AriMelber	710121417304612864	2016-03-16T15:11:53	Garland would also be 4th Jewish judge on this SCOTUS if confirmed - it's comprised of Jews &amp; Catholics, lacking wider religious diversity.
AriMelber	710119109233676289	2016-03-16T15:02:43	Liberals concerned about Garland b/c of what's NOT there - blank slate - not specific rulings. Exception: Crime; he sides against defendants
AriMelber	710118510463164418	2016-03-16T15:00:20	If there is a theme in Garland's record on DC Circuit, it is siding with federal agencies in disputes over their power.  (Rulemaking/Admin)
AriMelber	710117783204450305	2016-03-16T14:57:27	In the few cases where SCOTUS reversed a Garland ruling, it was often an area where new precedent was in play - Gitmo, DC gun ban.
AriMelber	710117368631050240	2016-03-16T14:55:48	We reviewed Garland's major rulings on the bench - the record is careful to the point of dry, measured and minimalist even on hot issues.
AriMelber	710116927931355136	2016-03-16T14:54:03	Politically, Garland is not a figure progressives would choose - he is one of the more conservative picks a Dem admin would make.

AriMelber	710115473485144064	2016-03-16T14:48:16	1/ .AriMelber makes a great point. Garland is chief judge of D.C. circuit, which handles regulatory spats and exec-congress disputes.
AriMelber	710103186716168192	2016-03-16T13:59:27	My colleagues and I on Judiciary Committee have already given our advice &amp; consent on SCOTUSnominee: We won't have any hearings or votes.
AriMelber	710107852589834241	2016-03-16T14:17:59	Garland is known for following precedent, deferring to federal agencies on rulemaking, and siding against criminals in federal appeals.
AriMelber	710106975804067841	2016-03-16T14:14:30	Garland has been a federal judge for 19 years *but* is seen as a "safe" pick, shows how careful his rulings are - no risky paper trail.

AriMelber	699948929346101248	2016-02-17T13:30:03	+all *that* accepts debate as it's been described -- There's also an argument that Apple helping w 1 phone isn't really a wider backdoor.
AriMelber	699946072764977152	2016-02-17T13:18:42	You can imagine a scenario where a broad backdoor is created and bad guys exploit it more than the Feds, so to speak
AriMelber	699945893844353024	2016-02-17T13:18:00	So that's a separate question from what's best in theory -- Apple help gov more -- and becomes a question of what would succeed.
AriMelber	699945684833853442	2016-02-17T13:17:10	I'm certainly no cybersecurity expert, but wide range of sources w tech know-how believe that creating a backdoor is a security risk itself
AriMelber	699945290510557184	2016-02-17T13:15:36	And that's just on the legal standoff.   Then there's the technology thicket of how this encryption works and the risks of changing it...
AriMelber	699944716775923712	2016-02-17T13:13:19	If a company gives up everything it has to gov, Apple argues, why should it also have to become an agent/expert in a gov investigation?
AriMelber	699944568792489984	2016-02-17T13:12:44	But Apple makes an important point about whether gov is moving goal posts in a new, innovative tech era
AriMelber	699944480653312003	2016-02-17T13:12:23	FBI/ law enforcement sources have long insisted this beef is different b/c they ARE following Constitutional rules, Apple is thwarting them
AriMelber	699944205154721792	2016-02-17T13:11:17	Many post-9/11 civil liberties fights were about the gov trying to cut the courts out of privacy checks - warrantless wiretapping, nsa data
AriMelber	699943676542373888	2016-02-17T13:09:11	First, the Apple fight is NOT a typical civil liberties dispute, because the gov is honoring privacy rules by going to court for its search

AriMelber	695036884469190656	2016-02-04T00:11:21	For a future Cosby trial, the pivotal moment in these 2 days was when judge asked:  Why doesn't Cosby just try to suppress the deposition?

AriMelber	695033817900453889	2016-02-03T23:59:09	bmaz Have you read the briefs? Was a real uphill battle without written evidence
AriMelber	695033096190742528	2016-02-03T23:56:17	That fmr DA is critical; last year he told me perjury charge would "put that old man in prison for yrs &amp; "he'll die" 
AriMelber	695031651974381568	2016-02-03T23:50:33	But today's ruling is not about the motive of any past deal for Cosby, but whether a deal legally ends this case. Judge said it doesn't.
AriMelber	695031456385626112	2016-02-03T23:49:46	To be clear and fair to the former prosecutor, *his* argument was that the deal was in order to hold Cosby accountable in a diff civil suit.
AriMelber	695031179460878336	2016-02-03T23:48:40	Cosby's lawyers said they weren't seeking "special treatment," but former DA conceded this was the only time he'd ever offered such a deal.

AriMelber	695026949740220416	2016-02-03T23:31:52	. @PuddyKatz3  Lawyers like written decisions for later use and/or appeal
AriMelber	695026668591783937	2016-02-03T23:30:45	Now does Cosby losing these motions to dismiss reveal anything re how the trial will go on the charges? No, this is procedural preseason.
AriMelber	695026420947542016	2016-02-03T23:29:46	Pros/cons to diff trial strategies, easy to 2nd-guess &amp; be wrong; but Cosby's lawyers are certainly going aggressive on each item so far.
AriMelber	695025699544027136	2016-02-03T23:26:54	After losing both motions, Cosby's lawyers then asked the judge to write up his order.  Judge said no, and noted law doesn't require it.
AriMelber	695025294395195392	2016-02-03T23:25:17	Now legally, Cosby's lawyers had the uphill battle here -- they had to prove facts for their motions. Tables will turn in a trial.
AriMelber	695025141152157696	2016-02-03T23:24:41	So Cosby's lawyers came out of the gate swinging very hard - toss this case, toss this prosecutor - and lost after 2 days of hearings.
AriMelber	695024970943045632	2016-02-03T23:24:00	Breaking: Bill Cosby just lost his *other* defense motion -- Judge rejects attempt to disqualify the prosecutor who charged Cosby.
AriMelber	695024523113009153	2016-02-03T23:22:13	These new Cosby court hearings included Cosby's lawyers calling a former DA as *their* witness, who then told them, "I'm not on your team."
AriMelber	695020598964150272	2016-02-03T23:06:38	.AriMelber explained what this Cosby fight was all about:

AriMelber	695019746341720064	2016-02-03T23:03:15	But immunity dispute boils down to facts - IF one really has immunity, courts honor it; judge found Cosby couldn't prove he had it. 2/2
AriMelber	695019492083019776	2016-02-03T23:02:14	This was a curious start to the prosecution of Bill Cosby -- his lawyers arguing he should not be subject to trial bc of a secret deal. 1/2
AriMelber	695018861163188224	2016-02-03T22:59:43	Legally, burden was ON Cosby to prove deal existed protecting him from prosecution  At trial, of course, burden is ON state to prove charges
AriMelber	695018429116362753	2016-02-03T22:58:00	Cosby's lawyers began this case very aggressively - claiming immunity and seeking disqualification of the D.A. They've just lost Round 1.
AriMelber	695018139554156544	2016-02-03T22:56:51	Breaking: Judge rejects Bill Cosby's claim that he had deal with D.A. ruling out prosecution - case will continue.
