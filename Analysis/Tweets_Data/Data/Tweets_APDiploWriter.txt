APDiploWriter	684600780578504704	2016-01-06T05:02:00	speechboy71 It wasn't a hostile question. I was asking b/c I covered this closely at the time and thought you might know something I didn't
APDiploWriter	684597969065226240	2016-01-06T04:50:49	speechboy71 As I said, and still maintain, it was the final straw, and therefore significant. Were you in govt at the time?
APDiploWriter	684597133329186816	2016-01-06T04:47:30	speechboy71 kampeas Yeah, the guy in Menudo... Or was it Musical Youth?
APDiploWriter	684596887639425024	2016-01-06T04:46:31	speechboy71 kampeas I don't know. You can't either. Point is he lost US support and that was a major factor
APDiploWriter	684595837113098240	2016-01-06T04:42:21	Osloweknownas No. Look at my tweets. Am skeptical of hydrogen bomb only. But will buy scotch if I am wrong.
APDiploWriter	684595327773601792	2016-01-06T04:40:19	speechboy71 kampeas Loss of US support was the last straw. Therefore, it was instrumental. Remember Marcos? Or are you too young?
APDiploWriter	684595009493053440	2016-01-06T04:39:04	speechboy71 kampeas Not saying he would/could have stayed in power forever. He is mortal.
APDiploWriter	684594659327406081	2016-01-06T04:37:40	tcwittes speechboy71 kampeas Frank Wisner was sent to Egypt and said Mubarak had to continue to play a role. He was rebuffed.
APDiploWriter	684594222020833280	2016-01-06T04:35:56	Osloweknownas Let's wait to hear the scientists. I am highly skeptical this was a miniaturized hydrogen bomb.
APDiploWriter	684593424914321408	2016-01-06T04:32:46	speechboy71 kampeas I will watch it. But, the WH made a decision to abandon Mubarak (rightly or wrongly) and it led directly to his fall.
APDiploWriter	684592728412450816	2016-01-06T04:30:00	JacobSegal1 cerenomri speechboy71 well, they had before..
APDiploWriter	684592440729333760	2016-01-06T04:28:51	speechboy71 kampeas It was straw that broke the camel's back, sorry. Loss of US support - especially after Wisner mission - was the end
APDiploWriter	684591836262985728	2016-01-06T04:26:27	speechboy71 kampeas And, he did.
APDiploWriter	684591756718030848	2016-01-06T04:26:08	speechboy71 kampeas He did.
APDiploWriter	684591423895777280	2016-01-06T04:24:49	speechboy71 kampeas 2011 speech? Thought you were talking about 2009. Of course Obama abandoned Mubarak in 2011 and that was major factor
APDiploWriter	684590672570118145	2016-01-06T04:21:50	speechboy71 kampeas I don't think Cairo speech was a sign of Obama intent, if that's what Frontline said. I am talking much later
APDiploWriter	684590175482175488	2016-01-06T04:19:51	Osloweknownas When the world's experts come back and say this was an explosion of a HYDROGEN bomb, I will believe it.
APDiploWriter	684589800876302336	2016-01-06T04:18:22	JJGomez127 Agreed. But it is a fact in this case.
APDiploWriter	684589606050873344	2016-01-06T04:17:35	speechboy71 I didn't see Frontline tonight, but it is undeniably true that loss of US support was a major factor.
APDiploWriter	684588038635270144	2016-01-06T04:11:22	Osloweknownas Yup. Just like Kim Jong-Il making 11 holes-in-one and carding 38 under par in his first-ever round of golf.

APDiploWriter	684576805622267910	2016-01-06T03:26:43	Osloweknownas Hah! But Sherman's negotiations with NK post-dated '94 Agreed Framework and did not yield a deal.
