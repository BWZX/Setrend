prchovanec	725706179729612801	2016-04-28T15:20:10	DividendMaster I'm not making a bullish argument. And anyway, I misunderstood which "E" you were using.
prchovanec	725705614819729408	2016-04-28T15:17:56	teasri DividendMaster "pro forma" implies that you're not using any consistent method of adjustment, just ad hoc.
prchovanec	725705474268651521	2016-04-28T15:17:22	teasri DividendMaster I would call it "adjusted", not "pro forma", which suggests you can say anything you want (as companies do).
prchovanec	725705300737687552	2016-04-28T15:16:41	DividendMaster as a CPA, I can tell you there are reasons for using GAAP, and reasons for not using GAAP. As long as you are aware.
prchovanec	725705050358714370	2016-04-28T15:15:41	teasri DividendMaster the numbers I'm pointing to come from the index authors, not from S&amp;P Capital IQ or others.
prchovanec	725704780719464448	2016-04-28T15:14:37	teasri DividendMaster they do have a common basis, which is why it differs from earnings numbers you'll see quoted in the press.
prchovanec	725704656991694849	2016-04-28T15:14:07	DividendMaster yeah, that was always not good.
prchovanec	725704475424505857	2016-04-28T15:13:24	DividendMaster "as reported" is GAAP. Operating is S&amp;P's method, which I think is more reliable than most, but gap is still an issue.
prchovanec	725704284667523072	2016-04-28T15:12:39	teasri DividendMaster the gap between reported and operating earnings (even as S&amp;P does it, which is conservative) is a concern.
prchovanec	725703829803663360	2016-04-28T15:10:50	teasri right, in any case, I probably jumped the gun thinking DividendMaster was saying P/E on operating earnings would jump significantly
prchovanec	725703289950580736	2016-04-28T15:08:41	DividendMaster yes, they include negative earnings. Not doing that is cheating, for sure.
prchovanec	725703190197485568	2016-04-28T15:08:18	teasri DividendMaster ah, understood, you are referring to "as reported" as opposed to "operating".  Yes, that is at about 23.4x right now
prchovanec	725702831018262528	2016-04-28T15:06:52	DividendMaster I think looking to the authors of the index itself is an entirely reasonable benchmark.
prchovanec	725702431812800513	2016-04-28T15:05:17	DividendMaster the earnings data usually quoted in the media is not consistent among sectors, good for hit/miss but not for P/E calculation

prchovanec	725701008043696128	2016-04-28T14:59:37	DividendMaster let's bet on that. Within what time frame? Next 3 months? Use official data from S&amp;P 500 website.
prchovanec	725699697478897664	2016-04-28T14:54:25	Excellent. Well worth watching.

prchovanec	725674900208291840	2016-04-28T13:15:53	stevanearly US companies are very cautious right now. The interesting question is whether that will translate into slowing job gains.
prchovanec	725674725293330436	2016-04-28T13:15:11	stevanearly well, inventory levels are elevated, so that's going to drag. Outlook is cloudy. Right or wrong, nobody wants to bet on growth.
prchovanec	725674432937754629	2016-04-28T13:14:01	Housing was the one real positive in Q1.  US residential investment grew by a very solid +14.8% on top of strong gains in previous quarters.
prchovanec	725672063739039744	2016-04-28T13:04:36	US business investment fell for 2nd quarter in a row, down a stunning -5.9% in Q1 (vs -2.1% in Q4). They also kept drawing down inventories.
prchovanec	725670669019680769	2016-04-28T12:59:04	US consumption has steadily decelerated for past four quarters, from +3.6% in 2Q15 to +3.0% in 3Q15, +2.4% in 4Q15, and +1.9% in 1Q16.

prchovanec	725668988416610306	2016-04-28T12:52:23	You can take that data and run with it in any direction you like.
prchovanec	725668879624708096	2016-04-28T12:51:57	I always enjoy how when I simply lay out the data, people argue with me like I have some sort of agenda. I don't. I'm describing the data.
prchovanec	725668476887638016	2016-04-28T12:50:21	The early indications for Q2 is that new exports orders have picked up due to weaker USD. But expect a lag vis-a-vis output.
prchovanec	725668007947689984	2016-04-28T12:48:30	The same was true when USD was strengthening, there was a lag effect on output, as export orders dried up.
prchovanec	725667856340422656	2016-04-28T12:47:53	People ask: what USD strength? Isn't USD down? Since February, yes. But it takes time for weaker USD to work its way through orders, output.
prchovanec	725667534243028992	2016-04-28T12:46:37	Not after February, correct, but it take some time to work through orders, and we're only just starting to see that. 
prchovanec	725667292948905984	2016-04-28T12:45:39	The big negative in Q1 besides wobbly consumer spending was business investment. Worried outlook makes companies reluctant to boost output.
prchovanec	725666995266527232	2016-04-28T12:44:28	Looking into Q2, if job growth continues, consumption should recover.  Weaker USD should help the trade balance.
prchovanec	725666390175264769	2016-04-28T12:42:04	Because you Trumpsters see it as a zero-sum game, where somebody has to be crawling to someone else. 
prchovanec	725666170553176064	2016-04-28T12:41:11	On positive side of Q1: Housing was strong and government (especially state and local) helped shore things up.
prchovanec	725665911701704704	2016-04-28T12:40:10	In Q1: Consumption growth slowed, business investment tanked and companies drew down on inventory, trade gap widened (from strong USD).

prchovanec	725303763318222848	2016-04-27T12:41:07	DividendMaster Hillary vs Trump is just Tweedledee and Tweedledumber.
prchovanec	725303367673745408	2016-04-27T12:39:32	DividendMaster because it's so important to have a real and not a fake conservative to go against Hillary.

prchovanec	725295465806368768	2016-04-27T12:08:09	DividendMaster yours is the kind of moral bullying that makes me reject Trump that much more firmly.
prchovanec	725295194501959681	2016-04-27T12:07:04	DividendMaster rejecting Trump does not make me a "supporter" of Hillary. I makes me a rejector of Trump, and acceptor of whatever I get.

prchovanec	725294674659958784	2016-04-27T12:05:00	DividendMaster because I'm concerned with more than just one race, and more than just one election.
prchovanec	725294483370299393	2016-04-27T12:04:14	DividendMaster if you think that's an effective vote for whoever, fine. I don't. But fine.
prchovanec	725294358879150080	2016-04-27T12:03:45	DividendMaster you won't take the answer cuz you don't like it: I'm not voting for Trump. Period.
prchovanec	725294176556998656	2016-04-27T12:03:01	twyodor HeerJeet he certainly didn't make my beliefs "explicit".
prchovanec	725294048634920960	2016-04-27T12:02:31	twyodor HeerJeet then why are so many Republicans, like myself, refusing to vote for him in the general?

prchovanec	725190915300679680	2016-04-27T05:12:42	RupewongD Smaulgld RudyHavenstein but it's a trader attitude, and an obnoxious one I'm so used to hearing on Twitter. Almost cliche.
prchovanec	725190426504863745	2016-04-27T05:10:45	RupewongD Smaulgld RudyHavenstein that's a typical trader attitude. If you're not a trader you're nothing. Give me a break.

prchovanec	725188774116864000	2016-04-27T05:04:11	RupewongD Smaulgld RudyHavenstein the topics that I was focused on, and commenting on, were like oranges to your apples.

prchovanec	725186916258291712	2016-04-27T04:56:48	RupewongD Smaulgld RudyHavenstein again, this is guilt by association. Since some "experts" are wrong, all expertise must be useless.

prchovanec	725185322217299970	2016-04-27T04:50:28	RupewongD Smaulgld RudyHavenstein my critique of Chinese banks was very much rooted in my accounting training / CPA.
prchovanec	725185033321979910	2016-04-27T04:49:19	RupewongD Smaulgld RudyHavenstein accounting allows you to ask the right questions about the numbers you are seeing.

prchovanec	725182185578311680	2016-04-27T04:38:00	RupewongD Smaulgld RudyHavenstein the idea all one learns in MBA is efficient market theory is BS. How about advanced accounting?
prchovanec	725173023297421312	2016-04-27T04:01:36	Smaulgld RudyHavenstein to say that something is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition is not to conclude that it is irrelevant.

prchovanec	725172058641043460	2016-04-27T03:57:46	Smaulgld RudyHavenstein but none of that devalues what one CAN get from a top school, alongside other experiences.

prchovanec	725171580221947904	2016-04-27T03:55:52	Smaulgld RudyHavenstein I've known people who went to top schools and got nothing, and others who went to so-so schools and got a lot.
prchovanec	725171133406928897	2016-04-27T03:54:05	Smaulgld RudyHavenstein the only reason the 2 years were so valuable is because it built on prior real-world experience.
prchovanec	725171005027700736	2016-04-27T03:53:35	Smaulgld RudyHavenstein that's silly. I spent 2 years at Wharton vs. 10 years in China and several more working the US.

prchovanec	725169945022226432	2016-04-27T03:49:22	Smaulgld RudyHavenstein put the degree aside. I would not have had the insights I did into China w/o what I learned at Wharton.

prchovanec	725169380506607616	2016-04-27T03:47:07	Smaulgld RudyHavenstein no I don't. If I didn't think it was worthwhile, i'd tell you. It wasn't worthwhile for others. It was for me.
prchovanec	725169084883718146	2016-04-27T03:45:57	Smaulgld RudyHavenstein that said, simply touting my degree proves nothing as to whether I know what I'm talking about or not.
prchovanec	725168887935938560	2016-04-27T03:45:10	Smaulgld RudyHavenstein that's actually nonsense, I learned a lot at Wharton that would have been very difficult to learn elsewhere.

prchovanec	725152698224508929	2016-04-27T02:40:50	RudyHavenstein I think, from all that I have seen, that Trump's is deeply unsound and perhaps even perverse.

prchovanec	724777044345819136	2016-04-26T01:48:07	stegermeister mattyglesias but core of Trump's appeal is not "moderate" and thrust is entirely different (nationalist, not conservative).
prchovanec	724776629046771712	2016-04-26T01:46:28	stegermeister mattyglesias it may well be true that some "positions" Trump has taken (for a day) are between Cruz &amp; Kasich ...
prchovanec	724776387270287360	2016-04-26T01:45:31	stegermeister mattyglesias furthermore, I don't see Trump as occupying "center' between Cruz &amp; Kasich, but different animal altogether.

prchovanec	724771740677734401	2016-04-26T01:27:03	stegermeister mattyglesias I don't think liberals should view a collapse of Republican Party to Trumpism as "good" for them or our nation.

prchovanec	724770917243564032	2016-04-26T01:23:46	stegermeister mattyglesias I don't believe the solution to Trump, from anyone's perspective, is to cede the political Right to him.

prchovanec	721363014503546881	2016-04-16T15:41:59	thedude0980 KStreetHipster your reasoning is exactly how people get there.

prchovanec	721362715369934848	2016-04-16T15:40:48	thedude0980 KStreetHipster so ... Viva la Revolucion, huh?
prchovanec	721362484972634112	2016-04-16T15:39:53	China's official GDP growth rate was just above 4% in Q1, based on the way everyone else reports it (q/q). 
prchovanec	721361773807431680	2016-04-16T15:37:03	The trigger could be Hague ruling in favor of Philippines, as early as next few months. 
prchovanec	721361545704431616	2016-04-16T15:36:09	Of course. Because all Chinese credit agencies say everything is awesome! 
prchovanec	721360797461573632	2016-04-16T15:33:11	thedude0980 KStreetHipster then demonstrate it (according to legal norms), don't assume it.
prchovanec	721360315456352258	2016-04-16T15:31:16	thedude0980 KStreetHipster your morality would be cleaner if it sprang from your own actions and not imposing commands on others.
prchovanec	721359946349223936	2016-04-16T15:29:48	thedude0980 KStreetHipster because your morality entitles you to negate others.
prchovanec	721359701976461313	2016-04-16T15:28:49	thedude0980 KStreetHipster So you take. You seize. You impose your desired outcomes over the choices of others. Is that it?
prchovanec	721359151738286080	2016-04-16T15:26:38	thedude0980 KStreetHipster idea behind Bill of Rights is that human beings have inherent rights and liberties regardless of majority.
prchovanec	721358904266002432	2016-04-16T15:25:39	thedude0980 KStreetHipster are you arguing for majoritarianism. Might want to check that Bill of Rights.
prchovanec	721358738972635136	2016-04-16T15:25:00	thedude0980 KStreetHipster you don't see it (at all) but I'm arguing FOR the possibility of compassion.
prchovanec	721358154190209024	2016-04-16T15:22:40	thedude0980 KStreetHipster freedom is what makes compassion possible. If you act by compulsion, that is not compassion.
prchovanec	721357754930212864	2016-04-16T15:21:05	thedude0980 KStreetHipster justice is what you must do (by compulsion). Morality is what you ought to do, given the freedom to choose.
prchovanec	721356976748433408	2016-04-16T15:18:00	thedude0980 KStreetHipster this is *the* fundamental difference between liberalism and socialism.
prchovanec	721356843705102338	2016-04-16T15:17:28	thedude0980 KStreetHipster you fail to recognize a distinction between justice and morality which lies at the heart of a free society.
prchovanec	721355275115081731	2016-04-16T15:11:14	thedude0980 KStreetHipster role of coercion (the state) is to create a space for moral action, not replace it.
prchovanec	721355133901217792	2016-04-16T15:10:40	thedude0980 KStreetHipster that's only true if you believe moral action can be coerced.
prchovanec	721354870096269312	2016-04-16T15:09:37	Wolf_InTheWilds are you talking about excess back reserves or offshore FX reserves? Completely different things.
prchovanec	721354545092239361	2016-04-16T15:08:20	Wolf_InTheWilds assuming Saudis don't spent it (which they may), it goes to someone willing to buy USD at a cheaper price.
prchovanec	721354129361252352	2016-04-16T15:06:41	thedude0980 toxicpath KStreetHipster no, it isn't. Not even remotely.
prchovanec	721353881503051776	2016-04-16T15:05:42	Wolf_InTheWilds that's not where excess bank reserves come from. Or are you arguing USD deleveraging is taking place?
prchovanec	721353170673352704	2016-04-16T15:02:52	Wolf_InTheWilds based on your reasoning, CNY should be under pressure to appreciate against an unwanted USD.
prchovanec	721352895237603328	2016-04-16T15:01:46	Wolf_InTheWilds could well be the person selling property, or copper, or whatever. But they're selling for USD. Follow the flow of funds!
prchovanec	721352716379955200	2016-04-16T15:01:04	Wolf_InTheWilds you're missing my point - someone ultimately holds the USD paid.
prchovanec	721352588629778432	2016-04-16T15:00:33	Wolf_InTheWilds and in this case, they are willing to buy them (at current exchange rate) and a lot go back into UST.
prchovanec	721352447793446912	2016-04-16T15:00:00	Wolf_InTheWilds but if you buy hard assets in USD, those USD don't disappear, someone has them.
prchovanec	721352238350929920	2016-04-16T14:59:10	Wolf_InTheWilds pretty funny to change your money into USD to avoid USD risk.
prchovanec	721351853477359616	2016-04-16T14:57:38	Wolf_InTheWilds and that's not a theory, it's pretty obvious.
prchovanec	721351735885881345	2016-04-16T14:57:10	Wolf_InTheWilds in China's case right now, it's the first (outbound payments)
prchovanec	721349393379684353	2016-04-16T14:47:52	Does it get balanced by increase in other USD payments? By a change in the value of the USD? Or by a change in US domestic interest rates?
prchovanec	721348820970422272	2016-04-16T14:45:35	Nonrelatedsense in your case, yes :)
prchovanec	721348723108876288	2016-04-16T14:45:12	In others words, the key issue isn't the UST sale transaction you see, but how the flow of USD funds it generates ultimately gets balanced.
prchovanec	721348067602075648	2016-04-16T14:42:35	When other countries sell US Treasuries, the key question isn't how much are they selling, but where are the US dollars they get going?
prchovanec	721347322135908353	2016-04-16T14:39:38	darpanbiswas and in that case, you don't even get USD decline cuz Chinese have their own demand for USD to make payments/move capital.
prchovanec	721346839669317632	2016-04-16T14:37:43	darpanbiswas or do they sock it right back into Treasuries? Cuz that's what's been happening with China drawing down its USD reserves.
prchovanec	721346398738903040	2016-04-16T14:35:58	darpanbiswas that's really the question: do the people who buy USD from Saudis do something different with the money?
prchovanec	721345942436360193	2016-04-16T14:34:09	darpanbiswas are preferences on the receiving end of Saudi USD sales significantly different than before?
prchovanec	721345706464788480	2016-04-16T14:33:13	Personally, I blame it all on the Habsburgs.
prchovanec	721344159987167232	2016-04-16T14:27:04	darpanbiswas and in this case, the consequences (weaker USD) is probably welcome, at least to a degree.
prchovanec	721343948258717697	2016-04-16T14:26:13	darpanbiswas but central banks can determine interest rates in their own currency IF (big if) they are willing to accept the consequences.
prchovanec	721343328604831745	2016-04-16T14:23:46	darpanbiswas if Fed doesn't want USD to fall, then it must generate that demand (raise interest rate by buying USD or to induce demand).
prchovanec	721342402821287936	2016-04-16T14:20:05	darpanbiswas but if exchange rate is allowed to clear the market, USD goods/assets demand destroyed = USD goods/assets demand created.
prchovanec	721341768181116928	2016-04-16T14:17:34	darpanbiswas selling UST *may* influence its price *if* the USD paid ultimately makes its way into a different USD asset.
prchovanec	721341388944764928	2016-04-16T14:16:03	darpanbiswas the question is, at what price, and does the Fed get involved to determine/influence that price.
prchovanec	721341173470781440	2016-04-16T14:15:12	darpanbiswas if you're going to sell USD, somebody has to buy (and hold) it.
prchovanec	721340919467884544	2016-04-16T14:14:11	darpanbiswas but when you sell a UST, you get USD, it doesn't magically transform into foreign currency.
prchovanec	721340740308201473	2016-04-16T14:13:29	darpanbiswas it's a change in preference among USD assets. The asset sold falls, the asset purchased rises.
prchovanec	721337650586730497	2016-04-16T14:01:12	darpanbiswas you have to look at the flow of funds that's created, not just the selling action in the market.
prchovanec	721337400996270080	2016-04-16T14:00:12	darpanbiswas and intervenes to prevent USD from falling (assuming insufficient demand for USD assets)
prchovanec	721337203440410624	2016-04-16T13:59:25	darpanbiswas the interest rate is only affected if the Fed cares about the exchange rate.
prchovanec	721337115657822208	2016-04-16T13:59:04	darpanbiswas and I disagree. The USD still exist. They just go elsewhere.
prchovanec	721336867799625728	2016-04-16T13:58:05	darpanbiswas in any event, Saudis are drawing down their USD savings anyway, to fund shift in current account.
prchovanec	721336729739923456	2016-04-16T13:57:32	darpanbiswas and the imbalance just shifts to whatever currency they are being assets in.
prchovanec	721336559799246849	2016-04-16T13:56:52	darpanbiswas what do Saudis do with USD proceeds? If they bid down USD to sell them, adjustment happens w/o Fed intervention.
prchovanec	721334990299115521	2016-04-16T13:50:38	darpanbiswas it really depends, there are too many variables to give you a simple answer.
prchovanec	721334707825340416	2016-04-16T13:49:30	Realistsofly JStacyAdams KStreetHipster and when they succeed (often after multiple failures) people call it luck or privilege.
prchovanec	721334498718302209	2016-04-16T13:48:40	Realistsofly JStacyAdams KStreetHipster a lot of people who start businesses have this experience, and they work way more than 80 hours.
prchovanec	721334130013773824	2016-04-16T13:47:12	Realistsofly JStacyAdams KStreetHipster no, obviously. But I certainly remember working on min wage, for a living, and it sucked.
prchovanec	721333116418334720	2016-04-16T13:43:11	Realistsofly JStacyAdams KStreetHipster basic takeaway is that it sucks to make min wage. I could have told her that before she started.
prchovanec	721332732119359488	2016-04-16T13:41:39	Nothing discourages me more than a glance at all the cheap rant books, right and left, in the "current affairs" section of the bookstore.

prchovanec	721323747991531521	2016-04-16T13:05:57	BeijingPalmer a varied pattern of minor motions when "still" would help.
prchovanec	721323248676388866	2016-04-16T13:03:58	BeijingPalmer people don't stay perfectly still when standing still. I suspect that should be fixable?

prchovanec	721322510659268608	2016-04-16T13:01:02	BeijingPalmer yes.
prchovanec	721321620502159360	2016-04-16T12:57:30	Lip motion and passive facial expressions still seem off (and vaguely creepy) with latest robots. Working on it?

prchovanec	721318280326221825	2016-04-16T12:44:14	darpanbiswas again, central bank can control interest rates as long as it doesn't control exchange rate, and vice versa.

prchovanec	721207362279895041	2016-04-16T05:23:29	trivianate Realistsofly KStreetHipster I'm saying you have to ask WHY and HOW. To get at real solutions, rather than superficial ones.
prchovanec	721207201294106624	2016-04-16T05:22:50	trivianate Realistsofly KStreetHipster so offer me a solution that's more than waving a magic wand.
prchovanec	721207009408872448	2016-04-16T05:22:05	Realistsofly trivianate KStreetHipster I sincerely hope you are :)
prchovanec	721206461473366016	2016-04-16T05:19:54	Realistsofly trivianate KStreetHipster given "reality" you describe, you'd think people would be leaving in droves, instead of coming.
prchovanec	721206195499962368	2016-04-16T05:18:51	Realistsofly trivianate KStreetHipster well, I see people defy your "reality" every day. Doesn't that bother you?
prchovanec	721206014037598208	2016-04-16T05:18:07	trivianate Realistsofly KStreetHipster I bet you read that on a bumper sticker once. Cute.
prchovanec	721205926838059008	2016-04-16T05:17:46	trivianate Realistsofly KStreetHipster yeah, it's condescending when you say "it's all luck and no effort" and preach helplessness.
prchovanec	721205345041965057	2016-04-16T05:15:28	Realistsofly trivianate KStreetHipster anyway, all I hear from this conversation is an ode to helplessness + a wish for deus ex machina.
prchovanec	721205168633720832	2016-04-16T05:14:46	Realistsofly trivianate KStreetHipster you don't need Mark Cuban. You don't need 1/1,000,000th of Mark Cuban.
prchovanec	721204859345747968	2016-04-16T05:13:32	trivianate Realistsofly KStreetHipster you really should talk to a few more immigrants.
prchovanec	721204765577895936	2016-04-16T05:13:10	trivianate Realistsofly KStreetHipster wow, that condescending attitude is exactly what is killing these people you say you want to help.
prchovanec	721204438808031232	2016-04-16T05:11:52	Realistsofly trivianate KStreetHipster I'm hearing a lot of can't. You're right, then. You probably can't.
prchovanec	721204313633255424	2016-04-16T05:11:22	trivianate Realistsofly KStreetHipster and you confuse capital with money. Which is the core problem.
prchovanec	721203863039164416	2016-04-16T05:09:34	trivianate Realistsofly KStreetHipster that's such an elitist attitude. I've seen people network from NOTHING.
prchovanec	721203758852620288	2016-04-16T05:09:10	Realistsofly trivianate KStreetHipster then objective number one should be to get the hell out of that town.
prchovanec	721203568498327552	2016-04-16T05:08:24	trivianate Realistsofly KStreetHipster How many hours a week do you work?
prchovanec	721203144475164672	2016-04-16T05:06:43	trivianate Realistsofly KStreetHipster you will need at least 2-3 authority figures (landlord, employer) to vouch for you.
prchovanec	721202862483759104	2016-04-16T05:05:36	Realistsofly trivianate KStreetHipster I've seen people do it. It's ain't easy, and it definitely ain't "luck".
prchovanec	721202771211456513	2016-04-16T05:05:14	Realistsofly trivianate KStreetHipster that's why you talk to everyone you can.
prchovanec	721202176652144640	2016-04-16T05:02:52	Realistsofly trivianate KStreetHipster forget about credit scores, I'm talking personal references. Baby steps here.
prchovanec	721202005306437632	2016-04-16T05:02:12	Realistsofly trivianate KStreetHipster the biggest obstacle, and here I don't have an easy answer, is if she has a criminal record.
prchovanec	721201846489059328	2016-04-16T05:01:34	Cripipper KStreetHipster well, then you do recognize there is a cost at which labor would be priced out of the market.
prchovanec	721201630507593728	2016-04-16T05:00:42	Realistsofly trivianate KStreetHipster social capital is going to be the biggest obstacle, and the key to changing anything.
prchovanec	721201383547002880	2016-04-16T04:59:43	Realistsofly trivianate KStreetHipster And establish some kind of work and credit record. References will be everything.
prchovanec	721201225899884548	2016-04-16T04:59:06	Realistsofly trivianate KStreetHipster to find something, anything, she's not fungible at. And talk to anyone who will listen.
prchovanec	721199786989391872	2016-04-16T04:53:23	trivianate Realistsofly KStreetHipster it's actually a high-risk strategy if you don't know EXACTLY what you're going to get out of it.
prchovanec	721199530448941056	2016-04-16T04:52:21	trivianate Realistsofly KStreetHipster there's a huge gap between that hard data and your extremely broad brush causal statement.
prchovanec	721199343383023617	2016-04-16T04:51:37	KStreetHipster trivianate Realistsofly that's actually NOT the way I would go about it, at all.
prchovanec	721199063706820608	2016-04-16T04:50:30	Cripipper KStreetHipster why not $25? why not $35?
prchovanec	721198887747395584	2016-04-16T04:49:48	trivianate Realistsofly KStreetHipster that is absolute nonsense, and a slander to many people.
prchovanec	721198634755309568	2016-04-16T04:48:48	trivianate Realistsofly KStreetHipster yes, the key is to stop being fungible. As long as you are fungible, you're toast, in ANY economy.
prchovanec	721198298472837120	2016-04-16T04:47:28	trivianate Realistsofly KStreetHipster speak for yourself.
prchovanec	721197963406614528	2016-04-16T04:46:08	Cripipper KStreetHipster apparently you can wish the return to labor to whatever you like it to be, so higher is better.
prchovanec	721197332461694976	2016-04-16T04:43:37	Realistsofly trivianate KStreetHipster yet ... apparently not.
prchovanec	721197140446429184	2016-04-16T04:42:52	Cripipper KStreetHipster &lt;&lt; rolling eyes &gt;&gt; Well, set it at $150/hour then.
prchovanec	721194928638988288	2016-04-16T04:34:04	trivianate KStreetHipster if companies made no profit, there would be no incentive for people to invest rather than immediately consume.
prchovanec	721194746635493376	2016-04-16T04:33:21	trivianate KStreetHipster you talk as though "profit" were superfluous. Profit is what attracts capital and organization.
prchovanec	721194289422852097	2016-04-16T04:31:32	trivianate KStreetHipster actually, you establish the rules with every dollar you spend in the marketplace. YOU value their labor (or not)
prchovanec	721194069075095552	2016-04-16T04:30:39	trivianate KStreetHipster and that saying all jobs must support max obligations at mature stage of life to be "good" jobs ignores this.
prchovanec	721193917090242560	2016-04-16T04:30:03	trivianate KStreetHipster no, I'm saying that there are stages in life where you are building your earnings capacity w/o max obligations.
prchovanec	721193682305683456	2016-04-16T04:29:07	trivianate KStreetHipster and if you want to argue that "relative" poverty is what matters, then you will always, by definition, have it.
prchovanec	721193536092311552	2016-04-16T04:28:32	trivianate KStreetHipster I never argued that, although I would observe that our standard of poverty has evolved significantly.

prchovanec	721187313573826560	2016-04-16T04:03:49	toxicpath arguing for regulation or even social goods is different from arguing for redistribution. Very different principles.
prchovanec	721186996752883712	2016-04-16T04:02:33	toxicpath yes, please prop up some straw man arguments I never made.
prchovanec	721186730523693057	2016-04-16T04:01:30	toxicpath KStreetHipster or worse yet, make others exercise my moral responsibilities on my behalf.
prchovanec	721186538151878656	2016-04-16T04:00:44	SweetAphrodite go for it.
prchovanec	721186361378783232	2016-04-16T04:00:02	toxicpath KStreetHipster no, I just don't wait for the State to exercise my moral responsibilities on my behalf.
prchovanec	721185799786598400	2016-04-16T03:57:48	SweetAphrodite you live in la-la land.
prchovanec	721185674678951936	2016-04-16T03:57:18	toxicpath KStreetHipster then do it, nobody's stopping you. Or me for that matter. We don't need the State to compel everyone.
prchovanec	721185218347053056	2016-04-16T03:55:29	anylaurie16 KStreetHipster yeah, it's too late by then. Not entirely, but the odds are certainly stacked against, by that point.
prchovanec	721184825902817280	2016-04-16T03:53:56	toxicpath KStreetHipster You like to use "should" a lot. As long as you benefit and someone else pays the cost?
prchovanec	721184483995684864	2016-04-16T03:52:34	toxicpath KStreetHipster a lot of jobs I held were pre-breadwinning, but vital steps in a path.
prchovanec	721183991974518784	2016-04-16T03:50:37	@ashes_77 I'm not dismissing the problem. I'm dismissing your solution to the problem.
prchovanec	721183745236213760	2016-04-16T03:49:38	ashes_77 you don't fix a ladder by sawing off the lowest rung.
prchovanec	721183578290302976	2016-04-16T03:48:58	@ashes_77 yes, the trajectory is broken. That's the problem, not the entry-level wage.
prchovanec	721181419033202688	2016-04-16T03:40:23	KStreetHipster you're describing a real problem in human capital that cannot be wished away by decreeing a higher salary for them.
prchovanec	721181151566675968	2016-04-16T03:39:20	@ashes_77 The premise is, lifetime income trajectories matter. A lot. And if you're not on one, it's not gonna end well.
prchovanec	721180568973635586	2016-04-16T03:37:01	ashes_77 so I owe you, then, right?
prchovanec	721180332280659968	2016-04-16T03:36:04	KStreetHipster you're trying to simply decree your way out of a real economic problem. You're looking for a short-cut when there isn't one.
prchovanec	721179987081109504	2016-04-16T03:34:42	KStreetHipster it's all about developing human capital. Without it, people AND the economy at large are screwed.
prchovanec	721179736265895936	2016-04-16T03:33:42	KStreetHipster I'd argue that such entry-level jobs are often essential to preparing people to command breadwinner salaries.
prchovanec	721179374205145088	2016-04-16T03:32:16	KStreetHipster the question is whether all jobs in the economy must earn family breadwinner wages, or better for such jobs not to exist?
prchovanec	721178880082620416	2016-04-16T03:30:18	KStreetHipster Yep. Min wage is not a family breadwinner's wage. If you are still on min wage when raising family, you're in deep doo-doo.

prchovanec	720983316263018496	2016-04-15T14:33:12	DividendMaster Wolf_InTheWilds in any event, the effect from currency isn't the absolute level, but the change. USD still up y/y.
prchovanec	720982524630056961	2016-04-15T14:30:03	DividendMaster Wolf_InTheWilds that's not a question of "currency war" it's a question of market-driven economic adjustment.
prchovanec	720982400348594179	2016-04-15T14:29:34	DividendMaster Wolf_InTheWilds well, you tell me, who should have a weaker currency, a chronic surplus country or a chronic deficit one?
prchovanec	720982207393873921	2016-04-15T14:28:48	DividendMaster the drop in the index you're seeing there is largely driven by a steady appreciation of the RMB.
prchovanec	720981998345592832	2016-04-15T14:27:58	DividendMaster there were huge job losses in energy/mining in the 1980s. It's a question of correlation to other sectors' performance.
prchovanec	720981729440370689	2016-04-15T14:26:54	DividendMaster Falling oil prices also had a big ripple effect on domestic Capex.
prchovanec	720981516189351941	2016-04-15T14:26:03	DividendMaster USD is falling more relative to major currencies than broad basket. And it's still relatively high. Situation is changeable.
prchovanec	720981257467904001	2016-04-15T14:25:01	DividendMaster Forget the unemployment rate. Look at new jobless claims or quit rates.
prchovanec	720981029348052992	2016-04-15T14:24:07	DividendMaster it's the major weakness. Elevated inventories across the board are a concern, as is the dollar (still).
prchovanec	720980621741395968	2016-04-15T14:22:30	DividendMaster one approach would be to say that external weakness will be deflationary so let the job market rip.
prchovanec	720980355403157507	2016-04-15T14:21:26	DividendMaster well, Fed is between rock and hard place: tightening domestic job market vs. external weakness/easing.
prchovanec	720980073931763712	2016-04-15T14:20:19	DividendMaster anyway, I wrote about it in January, here: 
prchovanec	720979759702941707	2016-04-15T14:19:04	DividendMaster I think the fact that they DON'T translate into recession makes Fed overconfident in raising rates later this year.
prchovanec	720979449626390529	2016-04-15T14:17:50	DividendMaster I don't think the current drags on earnings (energy &amp; materials) translate into recession. I see a different dynamic.
prchovanec	720978962038464512	2016-04-15T14:15:54	DividendMaster we're thinking about the end of the cycle, no question. But we don't believe that equals "end of the world as we know it"
prchovanec	720978706932625409	2016-04-15T14:14:53	DividendMaster I also wrote about a short but sharp US recession in Q1-2 2017. But yeah, that's "bullish" compared to "the sky is falling"
prchovanec	720978326660259840	2016-04-15T14:13:22	DividendMaster actually, trade-weighted USD index only hit its peak in January. Gotten better since. 
prchovanec	720977679906914304	2016-04-15T14:10:48	DividendMaster as for being a "bull" I've predicted flat S&amp;P 500 this year with bouts of negative volatility.

prchovanec	720977216625106945	2016-04-15T14:08:58	DividendMaster in my view, there were always discernible weaknesses that offered a far better explanation than weather.
prchovanec	720976952316850178	2016-04-15T14:07:55	DividendMaster I'm not a "bull" and I never blamed past negative quarters (even winter ones) on weather.
prchovanec	720976795751878659	2016-04-15T14:07:17	DividendMaster first of all, financial EPS hit a record high ($6.18) in 1Q15, so even a big q/q gain would produce a y/y drop.
prchovanec	720975568796299264	2016-04-15T14:02:25	DividendMaster we'll see what happens, I wouldn't call that before I see it.  And yes, we've seen negative quarters, repeatedly.
prchovanec	720975392723582976	2016-04-15T14:01:43	DividendMaster we see dramatically different earnings performance across different sectors in a pattern that has persisted for over a year.
prchovanec	720974847438938112	2016-04-15T13:59:33	DividendMaster I know everyone wants to have a binary view.
prchovanec	720974744342958080	2016-04-15T13:59:08	DividendMaster did I say "strong" economy? I said continuing sluggish growth with identifiable weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

prchovanec	720821545740984322	2016-04-15T03:50:23	NickMizaur YES. THEY. DO. Everyone has to justify their feelings, on everything. Nobody is exempt from rational criticism.
prchovanec	720821375515172864	2016-04-15T03:49:42	NickMizaur but telling me that someone else (with a less morally impaired skin color than mine) feels different is not an argument.

prchovanec	714921837487108098	2016-03-29T21:07:03	peterfraserbris depthdynamics anyway, those are non-household sources of credit, and I'm talking impact of consumer credit on net savings

prchovanec	712070158639046656	2016-03-22T00:15:30	I like these gentle threats that imply something bad will happen those of us who oppose Trump once he is elected.
prchovanec	712069088462434304	2016-03-22T00:11:14	MontalvoIsabela EWErickson what will happen to us if we oppose the president?
prchovanec	712068289489408000	2016-03-22T00:08:04	niubi I think he's just wasting his time.
prchovanec	712067056494059521	2016-03-22T00:03:10	domhewing right, cuz it was never part of the Russian empire for centuries, or anything.
prchovanec	712066695570071552	2016-03-22T00:01:44	domhewing you said: nobody who knows the region would take that idea seriously.
prchovanec	712066294707781632	2016-03-22T00:00:08	domhewing and clearly it's an idea that, rightly or wrongly, is taken seriously in many quarters
prchovanec	712066132241465344	2016-03-21T23:59:30	domhewing because you acted like it was a crazy idea Putin might make Estonia a target (or invasion, or just intimidation).
prchovanec	712065079949266944	2016-03-21T23:55:19	ToddCmii stuartpstevens SeanTrende ask the Penguin.
prchovanec	712064932548886528	2016-03-21T23:54:44	domhewing yes, and when I said Estonia is next "target" after Ukraine, I did not mean outright invasion was his preferred course.
prchovanec	712064574506344448	2016-03-21T23:53:18	domhewing in many ways, Putin's invasion of Crimea represented a failure. Certainly not his preferred outcome.
prchovanec	712064046963560448	2016-03-21T23:51:12	domhewing again, he doesn't want to invade, he simply wants to exert hegemony.

prchovanec	712061160812650502	2016-03-21T23:39:44	domhewing there is a not-insignificant Russian population in the Baltics: 
prchovanec	712060667218493440	2016-03-21T23:37:47	domhewing I'm neither a neo-con nor a neo-liberal. There's nothing "neo" about me.
prchovanec	712060413458915329	2016-03-21T23:36:46	domhewing it wanted (and still wants) to intimidate Ukraine into compliance.
prchovanec	712060234349613057	2016-03-21T23:36:03	domhewing Russia did NOT want to invade Ukraine, it wanted a submissive neighbor.
prchovanec	712059887145119744	2016-03-21T23:34:41	domhewing in fact, it comes up as serious issue in every transatlantic track 2 or security conference I've been to for past several years.
prchovanec	712059496810618880	2016-03-21T23:33:08	domhewing you first reply was like I was on crack and just making this up as a strategic question/concern.
prchovanec	712059247090077696	2016-03-21T23:32:08	domhewing NATO just deployed tanks to Baltics last year in response to these concerns, at local request.
prchovanec	712059011588292608	2016-03-21T23:31:12	domhewing look, you can agree or not with the analysis, but I'm not pulling Estonia out of my you-know-what
prchovanec	712058726165909504	2016-03-21T23:30:04	domhewing 
prchovanec	712058351258099713	2016-03-21T23:28:35	domhewing 
prchovanec	712058025490694149	2016-03-21T23:27:17	domhewing anyway, you get the idea. It's not like people aren't talking about this.
