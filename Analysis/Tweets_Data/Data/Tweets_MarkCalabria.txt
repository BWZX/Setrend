MarkCalabria	720373654442237952	2016-04-13T22:10:37	JoshZumbrun we've digressed a bit here, my point is that privacy, just like administration/enforcement, is a cost of a tax system

MarkCalabria	720371847901102080	2016-04-13T22:03:27	JoshZumbrun I'd say as a policy matter we accept what is likely a large degree of under-reporting for tips, not worth the admin cost
MarkCalabria	720371398259027968	2016-04-13T22:01:39	JoshZumbrun but we do, isn't the current system for tips largely an impersonal formula &amp; self-reporting? 
MarkCalabria	720370670350127104	2016-04-13T21:58:46	I think most economists accept that any taxation entails dead-weight losses, we should also examine other costs, such as privacy
