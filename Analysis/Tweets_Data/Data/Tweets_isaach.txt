isaach	703478553233391617	2016-02-27T07:15:31	cathygellis meangrape and back to the original question, is prep work already being done at the supreme court in anticipation?
isaach	703478495217725440	2016-02-27T07:15:17	cathygellis meangrape i’m fascinated. so on what timeline does this typically play out?
isaach	703478040093806592	2016-02-27T07:13:29	sayrer but then it comes down to whether courts interpolate/interpret congress’s intentions or enforce laws as written, right?
isaach	703475092915769345	2016-02-27T07:01:46	meangrape so how do you think this plays out?

isaach	703472154835185668	2016-02-27T06:50:06	meangrape ok… so how does it work?
isaach	703471742166011904	2016-02-27T06:48:27	meangrape huh, interesting. wouldn’t they at least be doing basic fact-finding to make that determination in the first place, though?
isaach	703470628444073984	2016-02-27T06:44:02	sincere question: is the supreme court already researching the apple/fbi case, anticipating its arrival?
isaach	703469789906251776	2016-02-27T06:40:42	sayrer i think the point is that CALEA merely says that it doesn’t authorize this. it doesn’t say that other statutes may not.
