HedgeyeDDale	723178844597841920	2016-04-21T15:57:27	shimblum Capitulation has to occur at maximum pain for open positions, IMO. So yes, I think that's definitely a factor.
HedgeyeDDale	723178608768876544	2016-04-21T15:56:30	If "everyone wins", then everyone loses -- especially if you're in the money management industry or service that industry (including us).
HedgeyeDDale	723178385724174337	2016-04-21T15:55:37	It's going to go to 0% and 100%, respectively if Janet Yellen keeps playing this dangerous game of "everyone wins". 
HedgeyeDDale	723178179347644416	2016-04-21T15:54:48	CiovaccoCapital Agreed on that. That's what TACRM is corroborating as well. We still think this reflation is a bear-market squeeze, however
HedgeyeDDale	723158370409025537	2016-04-21T14:36:05	UnitedStatism GreekFire23 Oh, you didn't know that the new bull case for the U.S. consumer and U.S. equities was rising gas prices??
HedgeyeDDale	723158047363747844	2016-04-21T14:34:48	HazeZH That's a fair point and one that I can't refute. I'm sticking with our process (as opposed to one-off bullish data points), though!
HedgeyeDDale	723157849493229569	2016-04-21T14:34:01	MyronSaysWhat GreekFire23 Not necessarily. I was saying I think there's little Yellen can do to flatten it from here absent QE4.
HedgeyeDDale	723145506730455040	2016-04-21T13:44:58	GreekFire23 That makes perfect sense too. I can't say I disagree with that.
HedgeyeDDale	723142960838221824	2016-04-21T13:34:51	GreekFire23 Perhaps. I'm wondering why we hit ~1800 on the SPY in early-February if that was the case all along. Cognitive dissonance?
HedgeyeDDale	723142719284109312	2016-04-21T13:33:54	That's a possibility and one many bears are fearing at the current juncture - except us; we still expect  a crash. 
HedgeyeDDale	723142251229093889	2016-04-21T13:32:02	SuperDaveTrades That's been the Fed's dovish transmission mechanism. My point is rhetoric alone can't compress ST rates or USD any further.
HedgeyeDDale	723141599023239168	2016-04-21T13:29:27	GreekFire23 Maybe they learned from Greenspan, maybe they didn't. 2008, summer 2010 and summer 2011 sell-offs suggests they didn't.
HedgeyeDDale	723140031741730816	2016-04-21T13:23:13	GreekFire23 That's exactly my point. She actually has to do QE4 to get rates spreads to compress further from here. QE4 before the crash??
HedgeyeDDale	723137492078067714	2016-04-21T13:13:08	GreekFire23 Not based on the OIS and Fed Funds Futures curves. There's no more juice left to squeeze out of rates markets w/ dovish talk.
HedgeyeDDale	723137260158230530	2016-04-21T13:12:12	Data has indeed stabilized on a sequential basis, but the trend remains lower and base effects steepen sharply in Q2 
HedgeyeDDale	723136438238203904	2016-04-21T13:08:56	That said, don't disrespect how bullish "stabilization of data in RoC terms in Q1 + dovish Fed = waning recession fears" has been for stocks
HedgeyeDDale	723136076336885760	2016-04-21T13:07:30	This morning's data confirms our view that the economy continues to slow on a trending basis and is set up to slow fairly sharply here in Q2
HedgeyeDDale	723135816478806016	2016-04-21T13:06:28	We've been getting a lot of questions on what could could take the market lower from here. Our reply: "The data.":

HedgeyeDDale	723134522108219393	2016-04-21T13:01:19	BeliefSystem failure in Europe is arguably more a function of how dovish Yellen has been on a rate-of-change basis.
