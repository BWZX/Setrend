EricaGrieder	724733621496500224	2016-04-25T22:55:34	Here Vince let me help ya out on this  
EricaGrieder	724731762874544128	2016-04-25T22:48:11	So many good points from jim_newell here that a Lemonade reference is in order 
EricaGrieder	724727875153203200	2016-04-25T22:32:44	undecided voter here. i was a terrifically awkward teen, so i'm drawn to cruz, but im also one of world's ten worst eaters,

EricaGrieder	724710434700324865	2016-04-25T21:23:26	It's so weird that Kasich keeps casting his refusal to do any work as a measure of virtue  
EricaGrieder	724647261234319360	2016-04-25T17:12:25	DylanBaddour lol I can't wait to eventually read whatever story you're reporting at the moment
EricaGrieder	724644306439405568	2016-04-25T17:00:40	Dug up in the archives this weekend: Houston's no flirting ordinance prohibited the making of "goo-goo eyes" in 1905 
EricaGrieder	724617061154975744	2016-04-25T15:12:24	Happy 40th Birthday to the one and only Tim Duncan. SpursNation 
EricaGrieder	724643283578679296	2016-04-25T16:56:36	wilbur_mb agreed
EricaGrieder	724642961934282753	2016-04-25T16:55:19	poncho_nevarez if Cruz was the nominee and lost the general the GOP would obviously blame him rather than take any responsibility itself
EricaGrieder	724642751564775424	2016-04-25T16:54:29	realdcm there's no explaining that guy
EricaGrieder	724642429849083905	2016-04-25T16:53:13	Smh the difference is that Kasich's ambitions are entirely contingent on Cruz's ongoing efforts  
EricaGrieder	724642107680428032	2016-04-25T16:51:56	I would agree. But that's a LOT of work to be the GOP nominee, and at a moment when the GOP brand is in tatters.  
EricaGrieder	724641513565642753	2016-04-25T16:49:34	Right; he can make that argument if he drops out now. If he's the nominee, tho, 2016 is his only shot at president  
EricaGrieder	724640767029858305	2016-04-25T16:46:36	mattdfreund yes, I think, but they differ in that Cruz is, at least, discernibly competing, &amp; having more success than Kasich
EricaGrieder	724637901632360449	2016-04-25T16:35:13	For debate: If Cruz were really as terrible, calculating and self-centered as people believe him to be, he would have dropped out by now.
EricaGrieder	724635517753552897	2016-04-25T16:25:45	Smh  
EricaGrieder	724602026366111749	2016-04-25T14:12:40	THAT WAS JUST BEING SMART BUSNESS MAN, YOU HAVE TO PLAY SYSTEM, BUY POLS TO STOP CRONYISM AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT! 
EricaGrieder	724436421327478785	2016-04-25T03:14:36	That too. (And has Kasich even said he aspires to win either? Smh) 
EricaGrieder	724435645901340672	2016-04-25T03:11:32	Back then (March 15) it wasn't so obvious that Grampy Kasich was going to win 1 state and otherwise help Trump  
EricaGrieder	724433544236265472	2016-04-25T03:03:10	Kasich isn't leading Cruz or Trump in any of these states. PA, MD vote before IN, which votes before OR, NM.  
EricaGrieder	724432229582032896	2016-04-25T02:57:57	This is Cruz responding in a rational way to Kasich's determination to play spoiler in all three states  
EricaGrieder	724386376628637696	2016-04-24T23:55:45	i, for one, am very against the false beliefs, which are the beliefs that are not mine

EricaGrieder	724066536915263488	2016-04-24T02:44:49	Austin: moon looks pretty cool rn!!
EricaGrieder	723943933516992512	2016-04-23T18:37:38	Hahaha walked right into that one 
EricaGrieder	723728967862120448	2016-04-23T04:23:26	Maybe Cruz should drop out. But why would Kasich want that? If Cruz drops, Trump is the nominee on the first ballot. 
EricaGrieder	723723834096910336	2016-04-23T04:03:02	GoSpursGo
EricaGrieder	723690332718665728	2016-04-23T01:49:55	1) I honestly have no idea 2) but his stance on bathrooms suggests Indiana is important 3) I'm going out now :) 
EricaGrieder	723606905172688900	2016-04-22T20:18:24	Single biggest thing Trump has going for him now is this attitude taking hold in the party:  
EricaGrieder	723618011027001345	2016-04-22T21:02:32	Remember when we were all awful for being skeptical about Trump's fundraiser for veterans?  
EricaGrieder	723650462621175809	2016-04-22T23:11:29	HCookAustin NmHorwitz I'll ask R.G. :)
EricaGrieder	723650391506739200	2016-04-22T23:11:12	A deep dive on some delegate details, for those gaming things out at home: 
EricaGrieder	723625855373697024	2016-04-22T21:33:42	It‚Äôs a myth that Donald Trump owes his support to disaffected blue-collar workers  
EricaGrieder	723647825817395200	2016-04-22T23:01:01	HCookAustin NmHorwitz also, there's a pattern--Texas is historically more receptive to claims related to economic rights than social ones
EricaGrieder	723647486707953664	2016-04-22T22:59:40	HCookAustin NmHorwitz yes- it makes me wonder if the bathrooms issue was raised here, and if so if there was a specific counterargument
EricaGrieder	723646280992354304	2016-04-22T22:54:52	NmHorwitz how were bathrooms used to defeat the national version? by arguing that an ERA would necessitate coed bathrooms?
EricaGrieder	723646097827106818	2016-04-22T22:54:09	NmHorwitz huh-I suppose that experience might have predated this, but Texas does have an ERA (as about half the states do...)
EricaGrieder	723644206040764416	2016-04-22T22:46:38	NmHorwitz were they!? I didn't know that. that's intriguing.
EricaGrieder	723643339745021952	2016-04-22T22:43:11	tehpwbh ha that sounds great. Have a fun night!
EricaGrieder	723640742124523520	2016-04-22T22:32:52	tehpwbh btw I'm now wondering if an ask-a-brother online portal might have some potentially salutary effect on our trumpled society...
EricaGrieder	723639492293226496	2016-04-22T22:27:54	tehpwbh lol it's possible that the brother in question has on one occasion been summoned for roadside assistance along those lines üòî
EricaGrieder	723635036876996609	2016-04-22T22:10:11	tehpwbh ha i endorse that. to be fair my brother mark sent me a picture of a coolant gauge &amp; told me to pull over if mine was in the red
EricaGrieder	723633237096951808	2016-04-22T22:03:02	tehpwbh ha brb gotta text my actual brothers that their remote diagnoses sounded comparatively less credible
EricaGrieder	723632272105070592	2016-04-22T21:59:12	tehpwbh some guy took a corner too tight in the parking garage and clipped my front driver's side corner :(
EricaGrieder	723629819708071936	2016-04-22T21:49:28	tehpwbh (I just picked it up from the shop for a theoreticallyunrelated repair)
EricaGrieder	723629300251918338	2016-04-22T21:47:24	tehpwbh A/c is blowing warm, plus this symbol. Any ideas on what might have gone awry? 
EricaGrieder	723625361704022016	2016-04-22T21:31:45	tehpwbh geronimolomax it is! Also uh hey, brother jer, do you know about cars?
EricaGrieder	723609905656029184	2016-04-22T20:30:20	dansolomon gotcha. samjohnftw just sent me this link, which has an example that further complicates the debate 
EricaGrieder	723607801545658368	2016-04-22T20:21:58	dansolomon (asking bc I'm wondering if I missed some specific bathroom-related incident that has taken on symbolic status)
EricaGrieder	723607257892581376	2016-04-22T20:19:48	dansolomon hmm...so is it that they're just the most obvious/visible example of what such ordinances/bills might apply to?
EricaGrieder	723606221282902017	2016-04-22T20:15:41	dansolomon but I mean, why bathrooms as opposed to, say, locker rooms?
EricaGrieder	723604545431986177	2016-04-22T20:09:02	Speaking of which...were bathrooms a focal point of LGBTQ rights before Houston's HERO debate? (And if so, why bathrooms specifically?)
EricaGrieder	723604099158011906	2016-04-22T20:07:15	Why didn't Houston face the same backlash over HERO that North Carolina is now seeing? geronimolomax investigates: 
EricaGrieder	723603651776802816	2016-04-22T20:05:29	DMKSeattle rossramsey that's awesome! :) who are your seattle picks, for that matter?
EricaGrieder	723601123609706496	2016-04-22T19:55:26	DMKSeattle yes--actually i'm just talking to a friend about this in relation to clinton/sanders :)
EricaGrieder	723595011858653185	2016-04-22T19:31:09	DMKSeattle dylanmatt I think "what's the matter with Kansas" IS snotty, not that people are too snotty about it!
EricaGrieder	723575462778142720	2016-04-22T18:13:28	A look at whatever it is JohnKasich is doing: 
EricaGrieder	723346661485875201	2016-04-22T03:04:17	RadioFreeTom HumphreyBohun SopanDeb you'll notice that he cancelled the Texas wall after the primary üòé
EricaGrieder	723345815326990336	2016-04-22T03:00:56	NewFirstEstate lol but you'll jump into such a fight, evidently. here i'll block you so you don't embarrass yourself in front of me again
EricaGrieder	723342399863291904	2016-04-22T02:47:21	MEHerlihy right so I gotta say I don't get all the moral urgency about it. I mean if it's a crisis Obama can write a memo.
EricaGrieder	723341562407608321	2016-04-22T02:44:02	MEHerlihy as it happens, in North Carolina you can correct your gender on your birth certificate
EricaGrieder	723341285080231936	2016-04-22T02:42:56	NewFirstEstate theimmackulate DouthatNYT jneeley78 so that's a no? Well, good luck! I hope your faith in Daddy Trump isn't misplaced.
EricaGrieder	723340391152394240	2016-04-22T02:39:22	MEHerlihy 1) not gonna read that article either 2) yeah of course but that cuts both ways. Has anyone been checking papers at the doors?
EricaGrieder	723339382069981186	2016-04-22T02:35:22	MEHerlihy a) not gonna read that article b) sure, but if the feelings of a given individual matter, then so do everyone's, like em or not
EricaGrieder	723338840597876736	2016-04-22T02:33:13	NewFirstEstate theimmackulate DouthatNYT jneeley78 ok, but: he's a 70 year old man. have you got anything he's actually DONE in life?
EricaGrieder	723338472245731332	2016-04-22T02:31:45	travisconsidine joethepleb A+++ service journalism from mr deshotel, thank you joe!
EricaGrieder	723338070037155840	2016-04-22T02:30:09	MEHerlihy ok but there it is. if the gender binary isn't even a useful heuristic, the aforementioned perceived risks can't be that serious
EricaGrieder	723337305344237568	2016-04-22T02:27:07	Lol, true. And no one's ever even given him a medal for that, so unfair. Here, realDonaldTrump: üèÜ 
EricaGrieder	723335941889224705	2016-04-22T02:21:42	NewFirstEstate theimmackulate DouthatNYT jneeley78 go ahead. tell me one great thing Trump's done that we'll remember him for.
EricaGrieder	723335665438478342	2016-04-22T02:20:36	mockingbird_red TheFakeMarkL l literally lol'ed but can't retweet bc it'd be needlessly confusing in light of Prince leaving us (RIP)
EricaGrieder	723335195890348032	2016-04-22T02:18:44	MEHerlihy lol, the new phrase is to call that "mansplaining" and you can't accuse me of it because, again, that whole gender-binary thing
EricaGrieder	723332401460432896	2016-04-22T02:07:38	DouthatNYT jneeley78 lol jinx! the only thing left is, they gotta promise Kasich that he can be president of Ohio
EricaGrieder	723331937146793984	2016-04-22T02:05:47	Hey GOP - we've solved your problem. Cruz/Ivanka 2016  
EricaGrieder	723331644677976065	2016-04-22T02:04:37	tehpwbh right? I mean he probably thinks Quine is low energy
EricaGrieder	723330991801032704	2016-04-22T02:02:01	aneeman stuartpstevens lol. also, true; come november i'll point to some specific examples ;-)
EricaGrieder	723329889370136576	2016-04-22T01:57:39	MEHerlihy ok i realize you're still an academic but you're going out of your way to ignore an obvious, like life 101 obvious detail
EricaGrieder	723329178603376640	2016-04-22T01:54:49	cd_hooks chrislhayes as for me, it's empirically the case that i'm more likely to get killed by a drunk driver than raped in an uber, so.
EricaGrieder	723328551504646144	2016-04-22T01:52:20	jneeley78 is she old enough?! if so...yes.

EricaGrieder	723326551639519233	2016-04-22T01:44:23	MEHerlihy "may be at risk in mens room" why? because men pose a differential risk than women?
EricaGrieder	723325794680852480	2016-04-22T01:41:22	jneeley78 Ivanka Trump and Ted Cruz have some interesting parallels, don't they?
EricaGrieder	723325500333023234	2016-04-22T01:40:12	chrislhayes cd_hooks First of all, this is an A+ bromance. Second, in Austin: Uber/Lyft is to Cabs as Cruz is to Trump.
EricaGrieder	723324946408042496	2016-04-22T01:38:00	Seriously, you know David Brooks' thing about "resume virtues" and "eulogy virtues"? Name one thing that Trump's eulogists should commend.
EricaGrieder	723324049338732544	2016-04-22T01:34:26	MEHerlihy but "doesn't mean you are ok with switching"--that implies that you have a valid concern about who's in your bathroom, no?

EricaGrieder	723320919653928961	2016-04-22T01:22:00	Needless to say, if Trump's feverishly ugly insecurity &amp; anger was an act, it'd be no excuse, but come on. Who would dream up this schtick?
EricaGrieder	723319721873932288	2016-04-22T01:17:14	AndrewDodge1967 I briefly thought this was in relations to the bathrooms &amp; was puzzled. Then I realized it was about Trump, and agreed. :)

EricaGrieder	723318953817169920	2016-04-22T01:14:11	To be clear, Trump is clearly lying about some things, like his concern for the American worker. But his viciousness? That's unfeigned.
EricaGrieder	723318497346879488	2016-04-22T01:12:23	prchovanec Oof man have you met him? [shudder]
EricaGrieder	723317899444686850	2016-04-22T01:10:00	MEHerlihy ok but if you're trans why would the nominal gender of the bathroom matter either way
EricaGrieder	723316878802706432	2016-04-22T01:05:57	7kidchaos I might be interested in hearing your thoughts if you hadn't approached me in a rude and pompous way. Bye now.
EricaGrieder	723315585052889089	2016-04-22T01:00:48	I wish I could believe that underneath Trump's repulsive veneer there's a reasonable adult but that's not plausible. 
EricaGrieder	723296904876969986	2016-04-21T23:46:34	MEHerlihy which one?
EricaGrieder	723282453339590656	2016-04-21T22:49:09	MEHerlihy Does that sweeping assertion not strike you as seemingly in tension with assertions about the importance of these ordinances?

EricaGrieder	723279194801610753	2016-04-21T22:36:12	Ok so, about the bathrooms. Is it eventually just gonna be considered untenable to have public facilities that take gender as binary?

EricaGrieder	722988060623818756	2016-04-21T03:19:20	StLouisBear see previous tweet. Later, btw, Houston resigned as governor of Texas rather than serve in the Confederate States.

EricaGrieder	722983881578684416	2016-04-21T03:02:44	StLouisBear Not at all. Sam Houston was one of those rare humans who would be correctly considered a true hero.

EricaGrieder	722972804816076800	2016-04-21T02:18:43	dpjennings You just called me "a shill for Cruz". That was dishonest; you know it was dishonest; and I don't play about this kind of thing.
EricaGrieder	722970640882364416	2016-04-21T02:10:07	wilbur_mb billwasik Ok, so, this is awkward, but...technically, you just offered a theory about a conspiracy. Like a conspiracy theorist.
EricaGrieder	722969766462263296	2016-04-21T02:06:39	Cruz should respond by denouncing Carson's character at length and demanding he fire someone.  
EricaGrieder	722969166815223808	2016-04-21T02:04:16	wilbur_mb billwasik conspiracies necessarily involve more than one person. This is just a theory about Trump's odd behavior.

EricaGrieder	722822904702873601	2016-04-20T16:23:04	racunatx ha! Been there ;) but yeah I think the fact that a component of DAPA is DACA plus is causing some unhelpful confusion here :-/
EricaGrieder	722811718695387140	2016-04-20T15:38:37	(Key because everyone saying the case is about "Obama's immigration policy" is, intentionally or not, unhelpfully politicizing the issue.)

EricaGrieder	721095760570294272	2016-04-15T22:00:01	As a journalist, I wouldn't have said this, so I'm glad Chip did. The greater scandal, imo, is Paxton's salary. 
EricaGrieder	721093503715966976	2016-04-15T21:51:03	DomenicoMonea oh to be clear, I agree with that. I mean it was precisely his job to defend Texas laws, regardless of his views/their merits

EricaGrieder	720771766813990913	2016-04-15T00:32:35	DrLwyrIndnChf Mormons are the most visible example, which makes sense-they're a clearly delineated &amp; unusually cohesive group, but not only
EricaGrieder	720771178202202112	2016-04-15T00:30:14	DrLwyrIndnChf ok so when i look at the trump v anti-trump divide, the latter is a coalition of people with ties to some 'values community'

EricaGrieder	720769678784593920	2016-04-15T00:24:17	DrLwyrIndnChf ha yes it's always worked well for Texans
EricaGrieder	720768093379629056	2016-04-15T00:17:59	DrLwyrIndnChf can I ask:--is 'in-group love' contingent on an out group? if so, is a posited out-group sufficient?
EricaGrieder	720766576346071040	2016-04-15T00:11:57	Ah DrLwyrIndnChf w some science relevant to those of us mulling how communities of value show resistance to Trump

EricaGrieder	720690142525018113	2016-04-14T19:08:14	_Ellegy_ yes, I'd like to hear the cashier's side of the story
EricaGrieder	720688554267967488	2016-04-14T19:01:55	SwansonNation &amp; yeah I think this is adorably weird &amp; seems to capture a lot about both of them!
EricaGrieder	720688141737132032	2016-04-14T19:00:17	SwansonNation lol yes that's the other part. If your premise is "Cruz is a halfway decent person" many things look quite different :)
EricaGrieder	720687844906246145	2016-04-14T18:59:06	Also that she called her mom to confirm whether returning the soup was the right thing "as a newlywed" AND THEN RE-BOUGHT THE SOUP?
EricaGrieder	720686960461778945	2016-04-14T18:55:35	RobbieCooper poncho_nevarez same and I also don't go for people of either party dismissing any &amp; all criticisms as ideologically motivated
EricaGrieder	720686503068733440	2016-04-14T18:53:46	SwansonNation I think if you start with the premise, "Cruz is so horrible", then everything else you learn takes on an unduly ominous cast
EricaGrieder	720685747024605185	2016-04-14T18:50:46	EricaGrieder You see a guy in the store with a cart holding 100 cans of soup, and the first thought is, "That guy will run for POTUS."
EricaGrieder	720685941824692224	2016-04-14T18:51:32	lol also Heidi's principled stance: "You don‚Äôt buy 100 of anything, much less canned soup." This is like...Chekhov.
EricaGrieder	720685064669888512	2016-04-14T18:48:03	Lol I missed the detail that Cruz bought 100 cans of soup bc he didn't expect Heidi to cook. That's true love. 
EricaGrieder	720683866764095488	2016-04-14T18:43:18	RobbieCooper poncho_nevarez I would guess not, because they all had roommates - JoaquinCastrotx?

EricaGrieder	720664325497561088	2016-04-14T17:25:39	J_Wade_Miller jbouie I tend to agree/be a troll about unions but to Jamelle's point I can appreciate that they foster a sense of community
EricaGrieder	720663580064919553	2016-04-14T17:22:41	J_Wade_Miller jamesdecker2006 plus there's this 
EricaGrieder	720663145883152384	2016-04-14T17:20:57	jamesdecker2006 as for that--we'll see. but I remember that 2009 chat bc he was talking about Dallas Fed data &amp; John Rawls
EricaGrieder	720662786267713536	2016-04-14T17:19:32	jamesdecker2006 well, I would argue that the Texan ardor for Texas is backed by an abundance of empirical evidence of state greatness :)
EricaGrieder	720660709030240256	2016-04-14T17:11:16	jamesdecker2006 jbouie Agreed. That's why I remain sorrowful even now that Cruz has got Trump himself on the ropes.
EricaGrieder	720658260047503360	2016-04-14T17:01:33	jbhenneman politics aside, isn't it kind of reassuring to see this much focus &amp; intelligence applied to a complex &amp; high-stakes task?
EricaGrieder	720657769284538372	2016-04-14T16:59:36	And, again, more SenTedCruz strategery. EricaGrieder 
EricaGrieder	720657810871037952	2016-04-14T16:59:45	jamesdecker2006 jbouie Also, strikingly--Trump fans clearly want to see themselves as belonging to a coherent movement (TrumpTrain etc)
EricaGrieder	720655308381523968	2016-04-14T16:49:49	jamesdecker2006 jbouie this is what I've been mulling for a few months: people who are part of a community of value don't succumb to Trump
EricaGrieder	720654969263656961	2016-04-14T16:48:28	DemFromCT jbouie And, I realize this sounds suspiciously thematic but seriously, Texas workers are so incorrigible Cesar Chavez gave up
EricaGrieder	720654636797956096	2016-04-14T16:47:09	DemFromCT jbouie plus, Texas is always "Texas vs the World" than "Workers v Plutocrats" ("Texas plutocrats" are a recent development)
EricaGrieder	720653353538064385	2016-04-14T16:42:03	DemFromCT jbouie I guess the short version is that Texans are the arrivistes that historically spurred labor to organize elsewhere
EricaGrieder	720652020701528064	2016-04-14T16:36:45	DemFromCT jbouie ha, cool. As for me, I was genuinely startled when protesters, having organized, shut down the trump rally in Chicago
EricaGrieder	720651413055885312	2016-04-14T16:34:20	DemFromCT jbouie this is among Texas's most intriguing idiosyncrasies- our "left" has historically been hostile to organized labor
EricaGrieder	720650576971706368	2016-04-14T16:31:01	The tweets that follow are the most compelling case I've heard in a while about organized labor

EricaGrieder	720364607034908672	2016-04-13T21:34:40	DemFromCT yes. I've heard folks from NY/NJ say they're fond of him as a person--I believe them, although I can't relate at all. But...
EricaGrieder	720363864819257344	2016-04-13T21:31:43	SteveKeller1990 yes, both valid points w/r/t the primary--I meant, we don't know whether "democratic socialist" is actually a GE killer
EricaGrieder	720363528884871168	2016-04-13T21:30:23	DemFromCT it's similar to how some Texas Dems (voters) were unskeptical in their excitement about Battleground Texas

EricaGrieder	720047912558854144	2016-04-13T00:36:14	gingermidget01 Look at Wisconsin. Cruz got 48% of the vote aka 36 delegates. Kasich got 14%, and 0 delegates--aka 6 delegates for Trump.
EricaGrieder	720047518873063424	2016-04-13T00:34:40	Seriously, though: millions of Americans are counting on realDonaldTrump. What's stopping him from running as a third party? He should.

EricaGrieder	720038018090819585	2016-04-12T23:56:55	LavnycLori aw, thank you for reading! I always appreciate readers, &amp; people, who seek out differing perspectives--we could all use that
EricaGrieder	720034334753730560	2016-04-12T23:42:17	LavnycLori largebill68 I think it's not so much his record as: he's not gonna win and so he's effectively helping Trump at this point
EricaGrieder	720032910049280000	2016-04-12T23:36:37	LavnycLori daw. Good man. But fwiw, I'd be doing my best to warn people if I saw Cruz as malign or a danger to the country etc
EricaGrieder	720030513805656064	2016-04-12T23:27:06	LavnycLori largebill68 ah, I see. At least we can all agree about Kasich ;)
EricaGrieder	720028031473942528	2016-04-12T23:17:14	CliffordAJones and I thought both filibusters were defensible on those grounds
EricaGrieder	720027314864545792	2016-04-12T23:14:23	CliffordAJones to me, i guess, part of the purpose of a legislature is the public deliberation, esp in a large &amp; heterogeneous society
EricaGrieder	720026749367496708	2016-04-12T23:12:09	NmHorwitz put differently I can see a case that he's duplicitous but pathological liars, lie compulsively, clumsily &amp; for no reason- right?
EricaGrieder	720026263868481536	2016-04-12T23:10:13	NmHorwitz did he? Lol. but that would be the kind of lawyerly misdirection I mean, not pathological lying
EricaGrieder	720025810451599360	2016-04-12T23:08:25	LavnycLori largebill68 huh. Which republicans do your GOP friends like, then?
EricaGrieder	720017089071685632	2016-04-12T22:33:45	NmHorwitz man, I just don't see that. His precise, lawyerly misdirections are like the opposite of what pathological liars come up with
EricaGrieder	720014385435906048	2016-04-12T22:23:01	LavnycLori and Trump is an extreme case...Texas Rs are disgusted by him. As for me, I just want all parties to have non-crazy nominees:)
EricaGrieder	720012809099083778	2016-04-12T22:16:45	LavnycLori I can see that. Politics aside, this seems to be a thing--NY/NJ Rs (Giuliani, Christie) never really click with Texas Rs.
EricaGrieder	720011689228312576	2016-04-12T22:12:18	CliffordAJones and, ideology aside, my feeling was that either they were both pointless grandstanding, or neither was
EricaGrieder	720011230329450496	2016-04-12T22:10:29	CliffordAJones oh, and there's another context discrepancy: coincidentally, Texas journalists had just covered the Wendy Davis filibuster
EricaGrieder	720008550353752064	2016-04-12T21:59:50	LavnycLori I have no doubt that that's true. I also have no doubt that NY is gonna go blue in November, though.
EricaGrieder	720007995858358273	2016-04-12T21:57:37	Les_Hammond this was my question too at the time (and still...)
EricaGrieder	720004846024142851	2016-04-12T21:45:06	JoeSta11ings thank you for reading! :)
EricaGrieder	720000979282837504	2016-04-12T21:29:45	Good EricaGrieder piece on misunderestimating Cruz. 
EricaGrieder	720004484634583042	2016-04-12T21:43:40	10. Another example: In TX, I run into Cruz friends all the time, like sometimes while walking the dog, which...doesn't seem to happen in DC
EricaGrieder	720001919079424000	2016-04-12T21:33:29	9. So I could see why they saw, say, the Obamacare fight as destructive grandstanding, tho I see it as: what Cruz promised us jerks he'd do
EricaGrieder	720000427681386496	2016-04-12T21:27:33	8. I personally don't fault Cruz for that &amp; obviously DC deserved the mischiefing but, to be fair, DC has never seen him not-mischiefing
EricaGrieder	719998239659831296	2016-04-12T21:18:51	7. And, I mean, Cruz's campaign platform in 2012 was basically "I'll harass DC with mischievous glee", which he indeed has proceeded to do
EricaGrieder	719992825329246209	2016-04-12T20:57:21	6. They weren't *new* criticisms. They were the usual criticisms but offered by people I know &amp; respect who are based in DC, not TX.
EricaGrieder	719991300150329345	2016-04-12T20:51:17	5. Apologies, I forgot to anticipate the logical question: What were the sincere Cruz qualms I heard in DC? So a couple more tweets...
EricaGrieder	719991064115814400	2016-04-12T20:50:21	skaggsjw ErinRehman MinneMike Mom_Mommy_Momma oops, ha yes all four of you have various versions of the same good question. 1 sec.
EricaGrieder	719980174784245762	2016-04-12T20:07:04	4. It's up to Cruz to mend fences (if he wants to) but if any of y'all are similarly queasy about #2016 I hope that's some small comfort :)
EricaGrieder	719979209930760192	2016-04-12T20:03:14	3. I bring it up bc my relatively sanguine state of mind lately is based on my anomalous data set about Cruz &amp; the context he came from
EricaGrieder	719975454569062400	2016-04-12T19:48:19	2. It was oddly reassuring to talk to several folks whose disdain for Cruz is sincere &amp; informed, albeit by a different data set than I use
EricaGrieder	719974076182372353	2016-04-12T19:42:50	Travel tweet #1. The past few days in DC were really very illuminating as far as certain bewildering disjuncts in #2016 perceptions.
EricaGrieder	719969019562823680	2016-04-12T19:22:45	squidpeople I guess I refer to state senators often enough that I say "US senator" when writing for TM but being in DC tripped me up :)
EricaGrieder	719967596297080832	2016-04-12T19:17:05	Emily30Red tehpwbh I hadn't seen what Beck said but: yeah. also reassuring is the nearly universal contempt Texas Rs feel for Trump ;-)
EricaGrieder	719963227623399424	2016-04-12T18:59:44	tehpwbh Emily30Red yes, same to you-- i'm thankful for people like you &amp; Emily, whose clarity helps keep me from succumbing to nihilism :)
EricaGrieder	719962601325666304	2016-04-12T18:57:15	Emily30Red tehpwbh I do that at times across ideological lines although not w people who I think are carnies
EricaGrieder	719962413290815488	2016-04-12T18:56:30	noisyparker tehpwbh yes this is what worries me still. millions of distressed Americans left behind again, still believing in Trump
EricaGrieder	719960371159830528	2016-04-12T18:48:23	Emily30Red tehpwbh -and without realizing the damage it does to one's soul, to sell your integrity for pageviews and cable gigs. (Sad.)
EricaGrieder	719957054530678785	2016-04-12T18:35:12	tehpwbh Emily30Red but I'm thinking of those (ex: EWErickson) who wrote the playbook Trump's now using &amp; had no qualms using it before
EricaGrieder	719956083406675969	2016-04-12T18:31:21	tehpwbh Emily30Red anyone who went all in with Trump has destroyed their reputations for good (including a few folks I really feel for)
EricaGrieder	719951173768208384	2016-04-12T18:11:50	Colorado GOPe/Jeb wanted primary. Groots wanted convention. Trump wasnt paying attention  ericbolling IngrahamAngle
EricaGrieder	719955062055940096	2016-04-12T18:27:17	tehpwbh and thanks but honestly, under the circumstances, it just sucks. Maybe more people will consider my warnings next time but still...
EricaGrieder	719954473381191681	2016-04-12T18:24:57	tehpwbh yeah...I guess the critical question is whether certain carnies one might name are grappling with their roles in this...
EricaGrieder	719952634757652480	2016-04-12T18:17:38	tehpwbh what worries me is GOP "leaders" should have seen this coming years ago. maybe post-Trump those who did (inc Walker) will be heard?
EricaGrieder	719952028458426373	2016-04-12T18:15:14	cgoodmantx oh right. Yes. But that theory was for a specific scenario-- trump as the nominee--which I'm not worried about anymore :)
EricaGrieder	719950984420724737	2016-04-12T18:11:05	tehpwbh I'm kind of a canary in a coal mine when it comes to the GOP base...lol :,(
EricaGrieder	719949860108124162	2016-04-12T18:06:37	tehpwbh --he is the terrifying, logical conclusion of this trend, and so maybe this is what it takes to wake people up? :-/
EricaGrieder	719949686283575298	2016-04-12T18:05:55	tehpwbh but, in any case, that piece gets to why my instinct was "no"--Trump is not the first "trump" I've covered. But to your point...
EricaGrieder	719949333102247936	2016-04-12T18:04:31	In my view, not really: for young Texas talent--like Castro or Cruz--VP isn't optimal:  
EricaGrieder	719948558049415169	2016-04-12T18:01:26	tehpwbh ha, thanks. I would actually have googled it for you as a further gesture of esteem for Wisconsin :)

EricaGrieder	719946822492549120	2016-04-12T17:54:33	tehpwbh hmm. I need to give that some thought-- Did you read that thing I wrote back in August called "the trump problem"?

EricaGrieder	719946205497856000	2016-04-12T17:52:06	R_Ephemeral chrislhayes readergirl Clinton could easily argue that Cruz is so sinister &amp; malign the risk must be taken to secure OH's EVs
EricaGrieder	719945674847031297	2016-04-12T17:49:59	JessicaValenti that's funny. My favorite is when they denounce me for enabling the ruling regime, as if I'm the key obstacle to revolution

EricaGrieder	719271294068486144	2016-04-10T21:10:14	jbouie ah, I see. thanks for the expertise :) so then is today's debate about it bc what he said seemed unduly peremptory/dismissive?
EricaGrieder	719268922453848066	2016-04-10T21:00:49	At the risk of exposing how baffled I am by Dem v Dem drama: is Sanders losing in the South more than one would expect against a Clinton?

EricaGrieder	719262572701171713	2016-04-10T20:35:35	laurakfillault ha yes. Cruz is the helicopter in that metaphor, that Trump is failing to dodge ;-)
EricaGrieder	719232158733307904	2016-04-10T18:34:43	Trump &amp; his surrogates are spending an awful lot of time setting up a rationale for why he lost... 
EricaGrieder	719234577265487872	2016-04-10T18:44:20	laurakfillault hahaha I thought you were looking at how Cruz's delegate strategy ;-D
EricaGrieder	719232879662862337	2016-04-10T18:37:35	tehpwbh lol, sounds about right &amp; also totally makes sense that you'd be a u of c guy :)
EricaGrieder	719232642609201156	2016-04-10T18:36:39	laurakfillault I don't know what that metaphor's in re (or even if it is a metaphor) but somehow I'm sure it's on point
EricaGrieder	719232006295388161	2016-04-10T18:34:07	Yes, I too would just stand there while a helicopter fell out of the sky right above my head.

EricaGrieder	719230617003638784	2016-04-10T18:28:36	gingermidget01 ha alas, it's true. Next meeting is later this month! And all credit to the art department for the visual allusions ;)

EricaGrieder	719227112624910338	2016-04-10T18:14:40	JaimeRPuente AndruByrne NolanHack ha yes exactly Jaime. People remember that, as they should, bc it says something about a pol.
EricaGrieder	719226926670475264	2016-04-10T18:13:56	JaimeRPuente texasdemocrats well, and to your previous point: Clinton's played in TX since the 70s. Turns out doing the work, works!
EricaGrieder	719225524338429953	2016-04-10T18:08:22	gingermidget01 5thCircAppeals you're absolutely right. My previous tweet was entirely serious! Also: 
EricaGrieder	719225154488909824	2016-04-10T18:06:54	JaimeRPuente AndruByrne NolanHack and, one of the factors is Clinton's high support among Texas Dems. Sanders, harder to gauge
EricaGrieder	719224872082214913	2016-04-10T18:05:46	JaimeRPuente AndruByrne NolanHack only if trump is the nominee (which seems increasingly unlikely)
EricaGrieder	719217338067726336	2016-04-10T17:35:50	Fuck this... he didn't come to play. I'm tired of elitist New England liberals who dismiss work done in the South.

EricaGrieder	719223389894897664	2016-04-10T17:59:53	Actually that's not true. Winning nomination is not wholesale popularity. Its retail one-on-one delegate courting.

EricaGrieder	719223478671511552	2016-04-10T18:00:14	DavidCornDC out of interest, does the dem map thus far "make sense" to you, as an expert on the candidates/primary voters?
EricaGrieder	719210385572806657	2016-04-10T17:08:12	Dumb analogy, Nazi's only won plurality of vote in Reichstag. Cruz is getting a majority of delegates at conventions 
EricaGrieder	719223032598896641	2016-04-10T17:58:28	gingermidget01 5thCircAppeals I know. In general the Dallas Fed is, naturally, the Tea Party Fed. But I'm a defender of the system :)
EricaGrieder	719222440027627521	2016-04-10T17:56:06	DavidCornDC agreed but on the bright side this garbage fire of an election is at least redrawing the regional map in an intriguing way

EricaGrieder	718497892789407744	2016-04-08T17:57:01	Via my brother (the John one), here's an excellent examination of realDonaldTrump's tiny hands from VanityFair: 
EricaGrieder	718497508930891776	2016-04-08T17:55:29	FricosisGuy (nb to your point, I think it would also be fair to say that he should have been more forthright in calling out the Akins)
EricaGrieder	718497361027149824	2016-04-08T17:54:54	FricosisGuy true, but the criticism of Mitt wasn't "his organization wasn't optimized". It was "he was moderate &amp; even-tempered"
EricaGrieder	718497062405287936	2016-04-08T17:53:43	DemFromCT coshoct jbview No, probably not. But what's he gonna do, threaten another lawsuit? Cruz ain't skeered of him.
EricaGrieder	718496809056776192	2016-04-08T17:52:42	jbview I dunno. Remember after the Chicago rally was cancelled? Rubio seemed genuinely shocked &amp; distressed. (Also seems sick of politics)
EricaGrieder	718494967388176388	2016-04-08T17:45:23	DemFromCT coshoct they're not gonna be in the hall. As jbview says, once the convention begins, it's all about the delegates.

EricaGrieder	718494669911384064	2016-04-08T17:44:12	DemFromCT coshoct Trump can bluster all he wants. But his complaints about being treated unfairly will backfire. They make him look weak.

EricaGrieder	718476707397656577	2016-04-08T16:32:50	Regardless of which party prevails, Cruz v Clinton would be a win for the country: a smart, sane, serious general.

EricaGrieder	715023582284353540	2016-03-30T03:51:21	Was gonna make a joke about how she doesn't have a "fantastic body" like certain other trump daughters but :(((((((( 
EricaGrieder	714984906800148481	2016-03-30T01:17:40	It's easy to laugh at realDonaldTrump &amp; he is a joke but he's degrading running for President &amp; that hurts America.
EricaGrieder	714965501860950016	2016-03-30T00:00:33	Smh pretty disingenuous for Kasich to try to conflate Trump and Cruz when his "chances" are wholly contingent on them *not* being allied...

EricaGrieder	713903480776237057	2016-03-27T01:40:28	WooPigSuey or the ones whose Twitter bios brag about who already blocked them üòÇüòÇüòÇ
EricaGrieder	713876718931587077	2016-03-26T23:54:07	If I were a liberal, looking at Trump as GOP favorite, why not Bernie? Electability off table. Could explain late surge. FeelTheBern
EricaGrieder	713895620772175873	2016-03-27T01:09:14	TrumpNation22 hmarie52 we'll find out either way soon enough. Evidence has a way of coming to light if a story is true :)
EricaGrieder	713895327686721536	2016-03-27T01:08:04	Halftime update: Boban needs only 44 second-half points to get 50. Something to keep an eye on.
EricaGrieder	713894929508896768	2016-03-27T01:06:29	ChasFlemming haha :)
EricaGrieder	713876075831427072	2016-03-26T23:51:34	Trump is 100% wrong. America is incomparably strong‚Äîyes a great power‚Äî&amp; phenomenally rich &amp; only huge urgent threat to that is his campaign.
EricaGrieder	713890452567527424	2016-03-27T00:48:41	tehpwbh JoeJaggie ah that's interesting. I hadn't thought of it that way but I can see their reasoning
EricaGrieder	713890086522191872	2016-03-27T00:47:14	TrumpNation22 yeah I'll ask about that awful pastor at some point. cruz is not hateful that way &amp; shouldnt pal around with ppl who are

EricaGrieder	713888944505561088	2016-03-27T00:42:42	tedcruzsschlong lol you've obviously heard of me. Sad!
EricaGrieder	713888794974380032	2016-03-27T00:42:06	efunaz thank you for the positive reinforcement! Have a nice evening :)
EricaGrieder	713888623544827904	2016-03-27T00:41:25	@DuckYalll freedom4all117 Rupp4ever nope wait I misread that (because of my previous blocking-lol). Apologies for the confusion ;)
EricaGrieder	713888341729476608	2016-03-27T00:40:18	@DuckYalll freedom4all117 Rupp4ever lol no you can block whenever you want. As can I. See?
EricaGrieder	713888085730144256	2016-03-27T00:39:17	beermonkey haha I apologize, that was thoughtless of me
EricaGrieder	713887798227406848	2016-03-27T00:38:09	TrumpNation22 not really. I think they were just goofing around as people sometimes do
EricaGrieder	713887564663422976	2016-03-27T00:37:13	efunaz not just that. If they threaten me of course they get blocked but if they're just being ugly, why would I bother listening?
EricaGrieder	713887286237114369	2016-03-27T00:36:07	efunaz but at times when I'm getting a ton of legit responses/?s (which I try to answer) I'll also block people who are just making noise
EricaGrieder	713886802742915073	2016-03-27T00:34:11	efunaz ha, thanks for reading. As for blocking, I usually don't block people for disagreeing unless they're being nasty or personal-
EricaGrieder	713886371623018496	2016-03-27T00:32:29	TrumpNation22 lol I know, if not for these pesky ethics ! ;-)
EricaGrieder	713885831228841984	2016-03-27T00:30:20	TrumpNation22 I haven't heard them. And believe me, the things I've heard are like...worth a billion if I got into blackmail
EricaGrieder	713885479075057664	2016-03-27T00:28:56	JacquelineWoodm lol the Rubio fanbots hate me. Cc ellencarmichael - she can confirm (unless she hates me too much)
EricaGrieder	713885108990705664	2016-03-27T00:27:27	Barb4TRUMP right but my point is that it wasn't just Rubio people &amp; in my assessment, they heard about it from trump people
EricaGrieder	713884798318579712	2016-03-27T00:26:13	tehpwbh JoeJaggie some do! But I'm stoical about how tricky it gets when I can't name my sources and my point is not preferable üòê
EricaGrieder	713874843331125248	2016-03-26T23:46:40	The generation of journalists 30 years from now will mock us for the way we described the Trump phenomenon. 
EricaGrieder	713884107252436993	2016-03-27T00:23:29	TrumpNation22 no, it's not. Don't believe me, ask mrclean2012
EricaGrieder	713883810656464896	2016-03-27T00:22:18	MissAmiaSays TrumpNation22 he did condemn it. Also the lady who made the ad is never trump but clearly dislikes Cruz (heh)
EricaGrieder	713883183301799937	2016-03-27T00:19:48	TrumpNation22 I've known Cruz since 2009 and have been covering Texas politics since 2007
EricaGrieder	713882930108456960	2016-03-27T00:18:48	RubenV4U lol thank you. I'm always hopeful that people can be redeemed even when they're behaving horribly at the first encounter
EricaGrieder	713882633365684224	2016-03-27T00:17:37	TrumpNation22 KatrinaPierson I agree but, sadly, I'm not sure someone like Stone would hesitate to throw a campaign staffer under the bus
EricaGrieder	713882230657916929	2016-03-27T00:16:01	TrumpNation22 the Melania ad (which I thought was out of line AND likely to backfire bc Melania seems great) came from a PAC, not Cruz
EricaGrieder	713881559552516097	2016-03-27T00:13:21	TrumpNation22 look I'm not against you as a person. If there is evidence it will come out. I'm just saying- always look at the incentives
EricaGrieder	713881291624566784	2016-03-27T00:12:17	TrumpNation22 here try this one from yesterday: 
EricaGrieder	713881080122609664	2016-03-27T00:11:27	TrumpNation22 no, they have not. And yes, I do think they included her purposely for exactly this reason- to misdirect trump supporters
EricaGrieder	713880615175593984	2016-03-27T00:09:36	satxangel TheRickWilson MissAmiaSays we'll have to agree to disagree...but fwiw: I'm against trump, not trump supporters
EricaGrieder	713880214120505344	2016-03-27T00:08:00	TrumpNation22 amandacarpenter KatrinaPierson including Pierson was diabolically clever, I'll give Stone credit for that much
EricaGrieder	713879599143264257	2016-03-27T00:05:34	ShaunHumphrey65 I was gonna block you but paused bc I'm curious to hear the elevator story. What happened?
EricaGrieder	713879424014221315	2016-03-27T00:04:52	tehpwbh JoeJaggie hi :)I really do appreciate those of you who didn't jump to the conclusion that I was blinded by my Texas jingoism, btw
EricaGrieder	713878770617176064	2016-03-27T00:02:16	trumper4life SeatMA1 if the rumors were true then sure- Cruz would be to blame. But there's no evidence that they are.

EricaGrieder	713877726810099712	2016-03-26T23:58:07	Amarillotxsguy I know and I don't mean all of you. Just the ones who were denouncing me a few weeks ago bc they thought *I* was biased. Lol

EricaGrieder	713876863953670144	2016-03-26T23:54:42	satxangel ZachLthrmn MelissaSturlic TheRickWilson I figured Rick was referring to the KP rumor I heard &amp; was warning him it's not true
EricaGrieder	713876647733100544	2016-03-26T23:53:50	@Yinzer1996 mbhouse lol I usually like to tell people why I block them, in the hope that some take it as a wake-up call and get better :)
EricaGrieder	713876197793398784	2016-03-26T23:52:03	rhea_snowden sorry, no you gotta say something stupid, nasty, or so piteous I feel sorry for you first :)
EricaGrieder	713875801939120128	2016-03-26T23:50:29	satxangel ZachLthrmn MelissaSturlic my sense, based on the timing, is Rubio fans heard it from trump people. They got played.
EricaGrieder	713875553187536896	2016-03-26T23:49:29	JoeJaggie tehpwbh tehpwbh (what is your name, btw?) can confirm I called out Rubio people for thething. But the rumor started before that

EricaGrieder	713874128864817152	2016-03-26T23:43:50	SeatMA1 amandacarpenter do you think Trump/Stone would hesitate to throw Pierson under the bus? They're not nice guys.
EricaGrieder	713873562017239041	2016-03-26T23:41:34	JoeJaggie tehpwbh I'd answer that question except it's based on a false premise. Sorry!

EricaGrieder	713847349886386176	2016-03-26T21:57:25	tehpwbh but more generally a detail that's simultaneously specific and plausible yet arbitrary and banal- those have the ring of truth

EricaGrieder	713838385438154752	2016-03-26T21:21:48	tehpwbh you mean like an operative not officially employed by a campaign?
EricaGrieder	713836336059273216	2016-03-26T21:13:39	Yeah. The Rubiobots were just desperate enough to believe a rumor (and, again--they really owe Rubio an apology)

EricaGrieder	713572754054746112	2016-03-26T03:46:16	And here's hoping for a weekend of renewal, whether or not you're celebrating Easter. (If you are: Happy Easter :) )
EricaGrieder	713571994357211136	2016-03-26T03:43:15	So, I just want to thank the many fair-minded people of #2016, who can see where I'm coming from on that, among other things [fist bump]
EricaGrieder	713571117051412480	2016-03-26T03:39:46	I try to be transparent about the epistemological obstacle course but, y'know. It can be tricky, exasperating, etc.
EricaGrieder	713570501126303744	2016-03-26T03:37:19	Sometimes I can see that what I'm arguing is inherently difficult to independently confirm, &amp; so I'm gonna be out on a limb, but so it goes.
EricaGrieder	713568645566242816	2016-03-26T03:29:57	It's one thing when I'm clowning Krugman with Dallas Fed data but in an election, with everyone kinda frayed &amp; super high stakes? Not fun.
EricaGrieder	713568079943340033	2016-03-26T03:27:42	As a result, I sometimes end up with a view that no one else has, literally just because I have an anomalous vantage point.
EricaGrieder	713567014334271488	2016-03-26T03:23:28	Meanwhile, the *vast* majority of the national political commentariat is based in DC/NY. It makes sense but it totally skews the discourse.
EricaGrieder	713566602831077377	2016-03-26T03:21:50	Texas is lucky to have more political journos than most states (largely thanks to evanasmith). But it's like 1 journo:1,000,000 Texans.
EricaGrieder	713565954152607745	2016-03-26T03:19:15	I think everyone who's covering #2016 has found it distressing, bewildering, etc. For me it's also been tricky because of the odd context.
EricaGrieder	713565382619963392	2016-03-26T03:16:59	Ok all it's been a long week but I hope I've earned a few personal-privilege tweets so if y'all will humor me
EricaGrieder	713565028742356994	2016-03-26T03:15:34	BreeBinderrr I mean...people are supporting trump for vastly worse reasons :-/
EricaGrieder	713564920026046467	2016-03-26T03:15:08	I take Bree's point but that video was seriously so adorable that I still sorta feelthebern 
EricaGrieder	713564264632430592	2016-03-26T03:12:32	BBQsnob sounds like a fair number of trump supporters round these parts, tbh
EricaGrieder	713563940026908672	2016-03-26T03:11:15	TobyMarie SonjaHHarris ha thank you- I am honored ;)

EricaGrieder	713563198226456576	2016-03-26T03:08:18	TobyMarie SonjaHHarris yes. btw thanks for your diplomacy earlier, my mentions turned into a total zoo so it took me a while to catch up!
EricaGrieder	713546790729945088	2016-03-26T02:03:06	Ted Cruz just retweeted this:

EricaGrieder	713550483172909057	2016-03-26T02:17:46	yatescr3 squidpeople or this corner. But put differently, that argument works better where communities were already divided

EricaGrieder	713469823146147841	2016-03-25T20:57:16	odd that Trump spox today hit Heidi Cruz for membership in Council on Foreign Relations whose president Richard Haass has briefed Trump

EricaGrieder	713547370546376704	2016-03-26T02:05:24	yatescr3 like, Kasich was very Ohio centric and won. Rubio sorta seemed to take Florida for granted until it was too late
EricaGrieder	713547116983914496	2016-03-26T02:04:24	yatescr3 that's interesting. Definitely in Texas. But hard for me to say if other states don't respond to such appeals, or no one tries

EricaGrieder	713453328781344768	2016-03-25T19:51:43	JD_Meadows compared to Trump? Uh, yeah. That doesn't make me a booster; it makes me a reasonable adult.

EricaGrieder	713451816755671040	2016-03-25T19:45:43	Yes, I meant the Republican primary. The Democratic primary is like Periclean Athens by comparison.

EricaGrieder	713438763087581184	2016-03-25T18:53:50	DemocraticLuntz DemFromCT lol, good thinking plus I would agree that Cruz should be accountable for his inappropriate murder spree
EricaGrieder	713438190619611136	2016-03-25T18:51:34	CheriJacobus of course. what a gruesome campaign season this has been all around :(
EricaGrieder	713437096984186880	2016-03-25T18:47:13	CheriJacobus yeah I hear you. I'm trying to steer clear of that whole hornet's nest--sorry for any attendant confusion

EricaGrieder	713433532236849152	2016-03-25T18:33:03	CheriJacobus yes, I suspect that's right. There was a sort of Florida valence to "TheThing" but I don't think you were part of that--

EricaGrieder	713427138934743040	2016-03-25T18:07:39	CheriJacobus why?
EricaGrieder	713426810688503808	2016-03-25T18:06:21	gingermidget01 I'm too young to know but surely it's partly that back then everyone didn't have a camera &amp; recorder in their pocket?
EricaGrieder	713425546290397184	2016-03-25T18:01:19	20. So, overall: those of you hyping CruzSexScandal are pushing a smear against 5 innocent woman. That's pathetic &amp; you should be ashamed.
EricaGrieder	713424832809963520	2016-03-25T17:58:29	19. Annnnnd, of course, the NatEnquirer has been doing Trump's bidding all year and this story is pretty obviously planted. I mean. lol.
EricaGrieder	713424258727174144	2016-03-25T17:56:12	18. Point being that more than one outlet has been trying to chase down Cruz rumors since January at latest. They'd have evidence by now.
EricaGrieder	713423726046384128	2016-03-25T17:54:05	17. (Also, side note, the Edwards story was prima facie plausible. Did the $500 haircut guy fall for a Bret Easton Ellis hanger on? Hmm)
EricaGrieder	713423178572271616	2016-03-25T17:51:55	16. But if you're harboring such suspicions, consider this: when the NE broke the John Edwards story, it was substantiated pretty quickly.
EricaGrieder	713422839710285824	2016-03-25T17:50:34	15. It's possible that all of those sources are wrong, or lying to me. Or heck, for all you know I'm lying to you to protect my boy Cruz.
EricaGrieder	713421665200250881	2016-03-25T17:45:54	14. None of my sources, in Cruz's circles or KP's, thinks this is true or even plausible (one yelled at me for asking stupid questions. lol)
EricaGrieder	713420879506513920	2016-03-25T17:42:47	13. In any case, after hearing the rumor (in January 2016) (in Iowa) (from a NY or DC based journalist) I asked around just in case
EricaGrieder	713420254584541184	2016-03-25T17:40:18	12. Who knows what lurks in the human heart? But presumably there would have been plenty of witnesses to any sneaking off in a public event.
EricaGrieder	713419502222872576	2016-03-25T17:37:18	11. In any case, as I observed to the tabloid journo in January, based on what he heard, the rumor *would be verifiable* if true.
EricaGrieder	713418799983144961	2016-03-25T17:34:31	10.(I'm not gonna bother trying to convince people who don't already realize that. It's just another reason I found it dubious in January.)
EricaGrieder	713418242119700480	2016-03-25T17:32:18	9. Further, if the controversial Cruz had snuck off with the controversial KP at a public event in 2012, I'd have heard about it, years ago.
EricaGrieder	713417436297502720	2016-03-25T17:29:06	8. It's possible that even this sinister mastermind has human foibles, but would he bang a volunteer in a closet at a public event? No. Duh.
EricaGrieder	713417141333073920	2016-03-25T17:27:55	7. If you know anything about Cruz, it's that he's calculating &amp; ambitious &amp; has been running for president since his Canadian infancy.
EricaGrieder	713416855658962945	2016-03-25T17:26:47	6. I had not. But it struck me as almost certainly BS for several reasons, which I will list in the next few tweets.
EricaGrieder	713416539827871744	2016-03-25T17:25:32	5. That was my reaction too when a reporter from a different tabloid asked me, in January, if I had heard this KP &amp; Cruz rumor
EricaGrieder	713415661934915584	2016-03-25T17:22:03	4. Note that KatrinaPierson isn't just calling this a lie. She's saying, correctly that it's not even plausible: "the absurdity is obvious"
EricaGrieder	713415441264160768	2016-03-25T17:21:10	3. Here's how KatrinaPierson responded on March 15th, the first time Cruz's rivals tried to make this happen: 
EricaGrieder	713414901612425220	2016-03-25T17:19:01	2.  I know some folks, as always, will believe what they prefer to, regardless of facts or reason. Sad! But setting them aside...
EricaGrieder	713413748380184576	2016-03-25T17:14:26	1. Ok, I said last night I would lay out what I know about the "CruzSexScandal", so I will.
EricaGrieder	713389641727143937	2016-03-25T15:38:39	Deepest respect to the pathologist whose talk was titled: ‚ÄúChainsaw-Related Fatalities: What Is All the Buzz About?‚Äù 
EricaGrieder	713412776681582593	2016-03-25T17:10:35	BigDuhie1955 lol, we do. But in the meantime I can tell you that another tabloid was trying to chase down this rumor back in January...
EricaGrieder	713411794811772929	2016-03-25T17:06:41	BigDuhie1955 (to me it's telling if there's no named sources, photos, etc that come out after the first story-when it's true they sure do!
EricaGrieder	713411435947098113	2016-03-25T17:05:15	BigDuhie1955 ok yes, makes sense. But if no such person comes forward, would you think that's suspicious?
EricaGrieder	713408951648264192	2016-03-25T16:55:23	BigDuhie1955 what kind of evidence or context would convince you that the story is true or untrue?

EricaGrieder	713405746205949957	2016-03-25T16:42:38	BigDuhie1955 AlanaBowker MrMikeSharp it's not. It's a lie that some campaign people came up with
EricaGrieder	713405258882387969	2016-03-25T16:40:42	TobyMarie spicy for me too. The salsa dona from taco deli in this case - we need a salsa emoji too !

EricaGrieder	713312652215193600	2016-03-25T10:32:43	Well! So far this morning I've learned that Trump's America is even more bleak and pathetic than I realized. This calls for breakfast tacos.

EricaGrieder	713306063278366721	2016-03-25T10:06:32	Trump is unworthy of leading the Republican Party, let alone America  
EricaGrieder	713310848425418752	2016-03-25T10:25:33	mikessweater MrMikeSharp AlanaBowker he'll probably ignore it. He doesn't need these sad-sack trumpkins to win.
EricaGrieder	713310468664729601	2016-03-25T10:24:03	deadmauz an energetic old man who wishes he could apply his energy to his daughter? Keep telling yourself that's a reasonable deal, kid
EricaGrieder	713309910172184576	2016-03-25T10:21:49	mikessweater MrMikeSharp AlanaBowker hmm, maybe bc it's a blatant lie that trumpkins will believe regardless of the facts?

EricaGrieder	713308562047373312	2016-03-25T10:16:28	mikessweater MrMikeSharp AlanaBowker that's your conclusion, probably bc you're desperate enough to believe whatever Daddy Trump says

EricaGrieder	713238182217691136	2016-03-25T05:36:48	buckeyes911 I agree with the goal! But a straight up Great Wall isn't the best way to achieve that imo
EricaGrieder	713237736346361856	2016-03-25T05:35:02	buckeyes911 plus, the actual border is the Rio Grande, so there are parts where a wall would ruin a park&amp;river- BP agents better there
EricaGrieder	713237209088823300	2016-03-25T05:32:56	buckeyes911 but in other parts, like where you have adjacent cities, some of which have "walls" (fencing) and designated ports of entry
EricaGrieder	713236725133287425	2016-03-25T05:31:01	buckeyes911 so like in west Texas, the big bend region, it's really rugged and mountainous that a wall would be hard to build &amp; redundant
EricaGrieder	713236509420163072	2016-03-25T05:30:09	buckeyes911 the things that work for border security really depend on where you are on the border (Texas = ~1200/2000 miles)

EricaGrieder	713149721632571392	2016-03-24T23:45:17	from the march issue of TM, this was one of the oddest stories i've ever done: 
EricaGrieder	713150390351441920	2016-03-24T23:47:57	Timodc he probably tries not to think about it because he likes guys who don't get captured :((((((((((((((

EricaGrieder	713149263354527745	2016-03-24T23:43:28	GMOM67 if anything, the southern states provide evidence against your claim. Compare Trump's margin in LA early voting to Election Day-
EricaGrieder	713149034802728960	2016-03-24T23:42:34	GMOM67 you said "the southern primaries" and then listed three states that arguably qualify as examples- again, with no evidence at all
EricaGrieder	713147397136715777	2016-03-24T23:36:03	You endorsed Donald Trump. 
EricaGrieder	713146357549105152	2016-03-24T23:31:55	NEW TONIGHT: Trump won Louisiana, but then Cruz forces took all the LA slots on RNC rules &amp; credentials committees

EricaGrieder	713143350019231744	2016-03-24T23:19:58	GMOM67 ok, but you didn't cite any evidence. You just named three states chosen seemingly at random.

EricaGrieder	713135479139348480	2016-03-24T22:48:42	Also (sigh) realDonaldTrump's latest wife tweet refers to "the GQ cover pic." It wasn't a cover pic. He's just THAT insecure &amp; pathological

EricaGrieder	713118227002359808	2016-03-24T21:40:09	Yes, good point. We've seen Trump voters switch to Cruz (Iowa...) but has anyone seen Cruz voters switch to Trump? 
EricaGrieder	713117286727438337	2016-03-24T21:36:24	mtracey says the guy talking to me about his feelings in response to my response to tehpwbh's question about data

EricaGrieder	713116360524451840	2016-03-24T21:32:44	mtracey well obviously there's a venn diagram but as you probably know, those involve two circles that don't fully overlap
EricaGrieder	713116056391319552	2016-03-24T21:31:31	trhediger lol that's very meta. in our defense, I'll say that although we're incredibly tedious we seem to have good intentions?

EricaGrieder	713113365216780289	2016-03-24T21:20:49	Yes. I could offer a more sympathetic account, but I'm not inclined to do so while they're inflicting Trump on us.  
EricaGrieder	713112446823587840	2016-03-24T21:17:10	aharbo DomenicoMonea I know, I know. My parents are both boomers &amp; they're great (&amp; they don't support Trump either). But as a group...
EricaGrieder	713111517835579393	2016-03-24T21:13:29	lilly64 tehpwbh ugh yeah. Tho, to be fair, some Trump supporters are legitimate NAFTA victims-like, they were in the fulcrum of history
EricaGrieder	713110726466928640	2016-03-24T21:10:20	Ha yes this too. Trump resonates with voters who prioritize their sad &amp; mad feelings &amp; their entitlements  
EricaGrieder	713109662791434240	2016-03-24T21:06:07	I think it's not surprising that the most selfish generation in US history is putting their sad &amp; mad feelings first

EricaGrieder	713107853255376896	2016-03-24T20:58:55	J_Wade_Miller EricRohrs yes, exactly. That's the point I'd like all pols to understand. if they do I may be curious, but not concerned
EricaGrieder	713107050348195840	2016-03-24T20:55:44	samjohnftw EricRohrs Aw, I don't see it that way, partly because I've always had people in my life whose faith moves them to good works
EricaGrieder	713106703546331136	2016-03-24T20:54:21	J_Wade_Miller EricRohrs Aw, I wouldn't say fully irrelevant. But to your point, here's how I put the question: 
EricaGrieder	713106163802308608	2016-03-24T20:52:12	Yes, speaking of which, America: can we have a national conversation soon about how Baby Boomers are THE WORST????  
EricaGrieder	713105884398772224	2016-03-24T20:51:06	sluggahjells ha I gave up after referring to your timeline bc all I could puzzle out was something involving tennis. But the human drama! üèÖ

EricaGrieder	713104919440396288	2016-03-24T20:47:16	ndhapple PatrickSvitek nice- congrats!
EricaGrieder	713104723629334528	2016-03-24T20:46:29	samjohnftw EricRohrs I don't remember the line. What do you want to burn down tho- the church?
EricaGrieder	713104568427552769	2016-03-24T20:45:52	Has he criticized Putin at all? Last I heard Trump was rushing to his defense after Putin played him like a fiddle 
EricaGrieder	713103796369379329	2016-03-24T20:42:48	sluggahjells This tweet is so well composed I felt moved to try to figure out who Stephens and Watson are :)
EricaGrieder	713102409589923840	2016-03-24T20:37:17	It's nuts. And Barton et al fail to understand that separation of church and state protects the church too. 
EricaGrieder	713101318252986368	2016-03-24T20:32:57	MrJoshPerry daveweigel That's just Trump taking a chance to be aggrieved, on behalf of a guy he then saw as a fan/future VP (lol)
EricaGrieder	713100268599021568	2016-03-24T20:28:47	Yes, me too. Cruz has been playing to win all along, but oddly reassuring to hear him say it explicitly.   
EricaGrieder	713099290860605440	2016-03-24T20:24:54	EricRohrs Thx. The question is crucial in my view too. A pol's faith is his business, but 1A is ours. For more: 
EricaGrieder	713098695697248256	2016-03-24T20:22:32	EricRohrs Agreed (though if so Cruz would still be less scary to me than Trump) (Trump can't regulate his emotions or behavior).
EricaGrieder	713098264204083200	2016-03-24T20:20:49	So...admittedly I'm superstitious about the guy, but tedcruz saying "Donald Trump will not be the nominee" is a huge weight off my mind :-D
EricaGrieder	713096256277467136	2016-03-24T20:12:50	EricRohrs 2) Cruz has repeatedly put his dad on stage, thereby, arguably, legitimating his dad's arguments,some of which are extreme
EricaGrieder	713095972276994048	2016-03-24T20:11:43	EricRohrs 1) for the reason you just said (Cruz has said his dad has been a huge influence; not true for Barton, the anti-gay pastor, etc)
EricaGrieder	713095190009884674	2016-03-24T20:08:36	EricRohrs Annnnd so you'll be happy to hear it's a question I asked Cruz back in 2013 
EricaGrieder	713094740904837120	2016-03-24T20:06:49	EricRohrs Yes, I agree. It's a legit *question*. (About Rafael Cruz much more so than Barton--it's like Jeremiah Wright on steroids)

EricaGrieder	712869182954717185	2016-03-24T05:10:32	To me, this isn't a hard call. realDonaldTrump has no attractive qualities. He's not handsome, intelligent, funny, kind, or competent.
EricaGrieder	712868713796616192	2016-03-24T05:08:40	angeladean yeah bc the bros are dumbasses. Makes me feel like I should step in because- what are they gonna say? They can't even try.

EricaGrieder	712858203004993536	2016-03-24T04:26:54	lol I'd say realDonaldTrump is insecure that Cruz's wife is smart, pretty, &amp; didn't marry him for his daddy's $$$

EricaGrieder	712853640164347908	2016-03-24T04:08:46	Speaking of Wisconsin, the MarquetteU polls circa 2012 are my favorite polls ever:  
EricaGrieder	712851207069388801	2016-03-24T03:59:06	Yup. Republicans just frame their victimhood (cf JonHaidt) as manly, principled grievance  
EricaGrieder	712844766984192000	2016-03-24T03:33:31	This is about Toronto's Rob Ford but you know why I am excerpting it.  (Fixed.) 
EricaGrieder	712849878284537856	2016-03-24T03:53:49	markyzaguirre (more of them are Republicans, plenty are unaffiliated, but there's more misogyny &amp; bigotry on the left than Dems see)
EricaGrieder	712849623509958657	2016-03-24T03:52:49	markyzaguirre not really. I think trump has given them an outlet that Romney did not- and I'd add that plenty of them are democrats

EricaGrieder	712488176254779392	2016-03-23T03:56:33	MissKimmieMaam not necessarily. But, in any case: Cruz is literally the only person who can stop Trump from being the nominee.
EricaGrieder	712487986659635204	2016-03-23T03:55:48	HoorayBeerz1 well, the grim news is that at this point only Cruz can stop Trump from getting the nomination. Isn't that grim?
EricaGrieder	712487780757012480	2016-03-23T03:54:58	@RealJLord lol that's sort of sweet that you think the GOP can disavow Trump--or that you personally can. Enjoy the choice you've made.
EricaGrieder	712487567355019265	2016-03-23T03:54:08	PeakLeftism and at this point, if not for Cruz, Trump would be the presumptive nominee

EricaGrieder	712486655064576000	2016-03-23T03:50:30	PeakLeftism As I said a couple of days ago, Trump was gonna win Arizona; he wins the effed up states. Cruz will win Utah.
EricaGrieder	712485952187277312	2016-03-23T03:47:43	MissKimmieMaam Neither Cruz nor Rubio was ever gonna win Arizona. Cruz is gonna win Utah regardless. Sorry to break it to you.

EricaGrieder	712390838647525376	2016-03-22T21:29:46	samjohnftw no, that sounds about right to me. might get you in trouble with fellow atheists who think nativity scenes violate their freedom
EricaGrieder	712388203949334529	2016-03-22T21:19:18	Hi. Are you thinking about libel and billionaires and media companies? You should read this:  
EricaGrieder	712389038309638144	2016-03-22T21:22:36	samjohnftw well, i see it most often between secular &amp; religious people i guess. especially w/r/t politics
EricaGrieder	712388454550626304	2016-03-22T21:20:17	samjohnftw and yeah, the zero sympathy--that's a problem i've seen before. been thinking of writing something about it this week
EricaGrieder	712388164485193728	2016-03-22T21:19:08	samjohnftw ooh no I haven't but it sounds right up my alley, added it to my list
EricaGrieder	712387068148588545	2016-03-22T21:14:47	profJKAiyer squidpeople Slate the "carpet bombing" was worse, imo, because it specifies a course of action which I would consider adverse
EricaGrieder	712386822706307076	2016-03-22T21:13:48	samjohnftw even if they're forced out--it's painful, but at least the exile retains a comprehensible reference point
EricaGrieder	712386452512845824	2016-03-22T21:12:20	samjohnftw to me, the thing is it's good for people to be rooted in *something*, even if they ultimately migrate, defect, or mutate
EricaGrieder	712379639788797952	2016-03-22T20:45:16	samjohnftw yes, I agree with you all around. it's probably too complex/emo for twitter but I've been thinking about this a *lot* esp lately
EricaGrieder	712378798772084737	2016-03-22T20:41:55	samjohnftw in your case are they asking cause you're an American in Russia or do you look ethnically ambiguous?
EricaGrieder	712378201104732160	2016-03-22T20:39:33	samjohnftw lol I can relate. although for me the trouble is that it makes me sad bc I don't really have a place I clearly came from :,(

EricaGrieder	711752864180207616	2016-03-21T03:14:41	CajunCampbell ChasFlemming thanks to you both. And feel free to refer them to me directly if they have questions. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
EricaGrieder	711722810377265152	2016-03-21T01:15:15	AmitMixie ha, let's hope so! But in any case: "general election v Clinton" is definitely one of the scenarios they gamed out in advance
EricaGrieder	711722589207433216	2016-03-21T01:14:23	UrbanAchievr but it can't be helped. Also, if that happens, they'll blame Cruz. GOP establishment should like that idea at least.
EricaGrieder	711722403202609154	2016-03-21T01:13:38	UrbanAchievr if you read that thing I wrote about the Trump problem in August this has always been my long term concern
EricaGrieder	711721760610066432	2016-03-21T01:11:05	hogganbeck it wasn't but there is an implicit &amp; important small-d democratic principle at hand
EricaGrieder	711721499774726145	2016-03-21T01:10:03	AmitMixie except, oddly, for Scott adams, the creator of Dilbert
EricaGrieder	711721385744162816	2016-03-21T01:09:36	UrbanAchievr MinneMike oh, and to your question. Cruz's is ICE. It already exists. Obama has made extensive use of it.
EricaGrieder	711721167900377088	2016-03-21T01:08:44	UrbanAchievr yes, but he's also a credible alternative to Trump &amp; the only one who'll have a clearly legitimate claim to be the nominee
EricaGrieder	711719757603409920	2016-03-21T01:03:07	UrbanAchievr look at the results of the first 27 contests and you'll see how revisionist that is
EricaGrieder	711719646433378306	2016-03-21T01:02:41	AmitMixie why do you think that? I'd say the only thing Cruz didn't anticipate, since no one did, is trump
EricaGrieder	711717989842690048	2016-03-21T00:56:06	UrbanAchievr what I mean is that trump and Cruz, combined, will go into the convention with the lion's share of the delegates
EricaGrieder	711717711881961472	2016-03-21T00:55:00	lpasqualina AmitMixie but win or lose, cruz would campaign on principles &amp; arguments, not "I'm a strong and luxurious man, godlike even"
EricaGrieder	711717318158454784	2016-03-21T00:53:26	lpasqualina AmitMixie no; he can win. If he couldn't win he wouldn't be running. Cruz Rule 10.
EricaGrieder	711717150017204224	2016-03-21T00:52:46	johnwow LPDonovan UrbanAchievr well, so it goes. GOP shoulda thought of that before they became a party that could nominate Trump.
EricaGrieder	711716392878256128	2016-03-21T00:49:45	Because the founders had this naive insistence on America being a free country where voting "matters" ugh  
EricaGrieder	711715880653066241	2016-03-21T00:47:43	johnwow LPDonovan UrbanAchievr cmon guys. Cruz is the one pulling off this feat. He's not doing it to prove his contrition to McConnell.
EricaGrieder	711715481145638912	2016-03-21T00:46:08	Having covered Texas politics since 2007 I'm familiar w modern GOP trends...Cruz didn't exactly write the playbook. 
EricaGrieder	711713656153571329	2016-03-21T00:38:53	UrbanAchievr oh, I see. Well, my first choice was Perry, so I can relate. But I'd say the horse is well out of the barn.
EricaGrieder	711713417795506176	2016-03-21T00:37:56	LinesnCircles likewise! I hadn't heard of that footnote. Which book is it?
EricaGrieder	711712942916444161	2016-03-21T00:36:03	AmitMixie i actually think Cruz as the nominee would be great for the GOP
EricaGrieder	711712579131875328	2016-03-21T00:34:36	LinesnCircles yes, I agree and have written that before
EricaGrieder	711712140256612353	2016-03-21T00:32:51	UrbanAchievr I'll answer your question if you answer one of mine first: do you have any evidence showing Trump as stronger in the GE?
EricaGrieder	711711815374213120	2016-03-21T00:31:34	LeeNels1 ChasFlemming yes, unfortunately the GOP has already probably stomped out that possibility though
EricaGrieder	711711396728217601	2016-03-21T00:29:54	CounterJihad GlockLady I'll just block you because you seem to be under the impression that I reached out to you, which I did not. Bye
EricaGrieder	711710867549609984	2016-03-21T00:27:48	coshoct I'm now in San Antonio. Thinking and driving is still safe enough :)
EricaGrieder	711710702033960960	2016-03-21T00:27:08	They're not. And they shouldn't be. But the GOP should be averse to blatantly flouting 60-80% of their own voters. 
EricaGrieder	711710331769192448	2016-03-21T00:25:40	CounterJihad GlockLady what's sad is that Trump supporters would be far better off with President Cruz. Trump's made you objects of scorn.
EricaGrieder	711709967699415040	2016-03-21T00:24:13	1) This can no longer be the GOP's foremost concern. 2) with that said: please refer to matchup polls &amp; Cruz Rule 10 
EricaGrieder	711709340634230784	2016-03-21T00:21:44	12. (Which would be fine by me, a political independent who has drunk the Schumpeter Kool-Aid, except it would yield Trump as the nominee)
EricaGrieder	711708674993954816	2016-03-21T00:19:05	11) For now: the persistence of such reasoning is has me bleakly concerned the GOP will continue its efforts to prevent Cruz from saving it
EricaGrieder	711707871570886657	2016-03-21T00:15:54	10) I can point out the problems with this NeverTrumpOrCruz reasoning if y'all would find it useful...smh
EricaGrieder	711707236590968832	2016-03-21T00:13:22	9b) Thank you to the people of Twitter for always stepping up to illustrate various points :) 
EricaGrieder	711706819106701312	2016-03-21T00:11:43	9. Many appear to be laboring under the belief that Cruz's success would give the GOP a chance to nominate a candidate *they* would prefer.
EricaGrieder	711706180192604160	2016-03-21T00:09:10	8. The delegate math seems to have forced them to accept that only Cruz can keep Trump from a majority but not the implication of that fact.
EricaGrieder	711705917192949761	2016-03-21T00:08:08	7. With that said I remain in a somewhat bleak mood in consideration of the ongoing obsolescence of national Republican leadership
EricaGrieder	711705526594199552	2016-03-21T00:06:35	6. Cruz just needs to convince 1237 individual conservatives that he's a better choice for them than Trump. (Not a very tricky lift...he is)
EricaGrieder	711704982211309568	2016-03-21T00:04:25	5. He doesn't need to elicit constant fawning from coverage from cable news or the grudging acceptance of GOP establishment leaders
EricaGrieder	711704418446548992	2016-03-21T00:02:10	4. That's basically a scenario optimized for a candidate like Cruz, especially under this year's dirisible circumstances
EricaGrieder	711704021099085824	2016-03-21T00:00:36	3. A convention fight is, effectively, a closed caucus...one with no ambiguity about how many voters will turn out or who they'll be
EricaGrieder	711703345233141760	2016-03-20T23:57:54	2. If Cruz can keep Trump from hitting the 1237 threshold he can win the nomination at the convention, thus precluding Trump from doing so
EricaGrieder	711702962641309696	2016-03-20T23:56:23	1. Ok #2016 fans I thought about this GOP debacle while driving to San Antonio just now and have come to a slightly less bleak conclusion
EricaGrieder	711642791391047680	2016-03-20T19:57:17	True. To clarify: realDonaldTrump's weaselly nature--his cowardice--is among his many grievous flaws. 
EricaGrieder	711641849073508352	2016-03-20T19:53:33	Trump is simultaneously &amp; preemptively: asserting a false grievance; calling for a violent response; &amp; disavowing responsibility for it. Smh
EricaGrieder	711640823465545728	2016-03-20T19:49:28	Just taking a moment to marvel at what a weasel realDonaldTrump is

EricaGrieder	711618766610694144	2016-03-20T18:21:49	HeerJeet BuzzFeedAndrew this is probably the worst thing Cruz has ever done but I promise you both he is not going to team up w Trump

EricaGrieder	711574064662315012	2016-03-20T15:24:12	GovernorPerry has no interest in running as a 3rd party candidate. For the good of the country, he wants the GOP to unite around tedcruz

EricaGrieder	711597924900188161	2016-03-20T16:59:00	HCookAustin well, whatever. More importantly, Cruz is not a thug with a fragile ego whose nomination would cause actual harm
EricaGrieder	711597449425457152	2016-03-20T16:57:07	.HCookAustin as do I (especially given trump will pivot wantonly) but there's zero evidence for Cruz being a worse GE candidate than Trump.

EricaGrieder	711596529614585856	2016-03-20T16:53:28	True, but Cruz's first election was 2012. Head to head matchups show GOP much better off w him than Trump.

EricaGrieder	711421740551774212	2016-03-20T05:18:55	RadioFreeTom anyway I gotta crash. But I'll read thru your 2016 commentary tomorrow &amp; we should talk again soon about the reclamation :)
EricaGrieder	711421027364970496	2016-03-20T05:16:05	RadioFreeTom oh man this gets to my theory about why Cruz v Clinton would be the best outcome for all of us. Neither is too "likeable"
EricaGrieder	711420362257371136	2016-03-20T05:13:26	RadioFreeTom part of why I hate Trump, in fact, is that he's now defined his supporters in reference to himself, a despicable person.
EricaGrieder	711420246750400513	2016-03-20T05:12:59	RadioFreeTom I hate *Trump.* Not Trump supporters. One of my own brothers likes Trump &amp; I'm an unapologetic advocate for my brothers.
EricaGrieder	711419862774521856	2016-03-20T05:11:27	RadioFreeTom and I'm glad we ended up having this conversation because we're on an eerily similar wavelength about this.
EricaGrieder	711419674387283968	2016-03-20T05:10:42	RadioFreeTom ha I apologize for saying your assumption was 'witless.' it was actually statistically likely given young woman in MSM...
EricaGrieder	711419487921176576	2016-03-20T05:09:58	This is also a terrific piece (about Trump supporters, specifically in light of KevinNR kicking the hornet's nest)  
EricaGrieder	711418512296677377	2016-03-20T05:06:05	RadioFreeTom ha, yes I can imagine. It's easy for me to take heterodox positions because both sides consider me ideologically suspect :)
EricaGrieder	711416079403253764	2016-03-20T04:56:25	RadioFreeTom &amp; also I agree about disaffected white working class voters but I'm not sure that Rs, or Trump, are taking them seriously
EricaGrieder	711415850176131073	2016-03-20T04:55:30	RadioFreeTom but if these principles are gonna be defended I think it's helpful for conservatives to acknowledge the costs, as you did
EricaGrieder	711415320255143936	2016-03-20T04:53:24	RadioFreeTom tbh I'm not a Kristol expert. It's possible he agrees with you &amp; me &amp; is just trying to convince Republicans who don't agree
EricaGrieder	711414345654083584	2016-03-20T04:49:32	Haha, yes I shoulda googled. I fully agree with RadioFreeTom here.  
EricaGrieder	711413685550329856	2016-03-20T04:46:54	RadioFreeTom the Constitution takes precedence over ideology. So does common decency. Four years of Clinton = less worse than Trump. no?
EricaGrieder	711411654349557760	2016-03-20T04:38:50	RadioFreeTom as for Kristol, I thought his tweet claiming that victory by an independent conservative is possible was disingenuous.
EricaGrieder	711410833431994370	2016-03-20T04:35:34	RadioFreeTom (the left's identity politics may serve as a similar playbook but as a Texan "the left" is somewhat unfamiliar terrain)
EricaGrieder	711410312126181376	2016-03-20T04:33:30	RadioFreeTom --that is: In August, knowing nothing about Trump, but a lot about the GOP base, I could see this: 
EricaGrieder	711409959280357376	2016-03-20T04:32:06	RadioFreeTom with that said: I know some individual carnies and can demonstrate that the GOP, collectively, has fostered these conditions--
EricaGrieder	711409449781428224	2016-03-20T04:30:04	RadioFreeTom I imagine that includes you &amp; it includes me in the sense that I share many of the principles, w/o being from the "movement"
EricaGrieder	711409001506873346	2016-03-20T04:28:17	RadioFreeTom as preface, I'm not interested in the blame game. The sad truth is principled conservatives are gonna bear the cost for Trump.
EricaGrieder	711408101686030336	2016-03-20T04:24:43	RadioFreeTom maggieNYT dandrezner BillKristol well, it's a longer response so I'll unsubscribe Maggie Dan &amp; Bill for the next tweets

EricaGrieder	711346659649695746	2016-03-20T00:20:34	The only reason Trump hasn't already effectively won the GOP nomination already is Cruz. Seriously. He's the only reason. That's insane.
EricaGrieder	711346042072014849	2016-03-20T00:18:07	Ok I'm about to go focus on the Spurs game but before I do: this entire Trump thing is so thoroughly appalling and surreal

EricaGrieder	711318550963625985	2016-03-19T22:28:52	schmid3 thanks for reading! :) &amp;you're right. But that's part of the reason I'm so anti-trump: he's all about himself, no plans/solutions-

EricaGrieder	711271518714470400	2016-03-19T19:21:59	Also true. Trump couldn't even have afforded the primary if not for the lavish "donations" from cable news

EricaGrieder	711267967292444672	2016-03-19T19:07:52	LouiseMensch Romney's argument is plausible but tendentious; Cruz's is plausible but tricky if he trails Trump. Hope that clears things up.
EricaGrieder	711267604594208771	2016-03-19T19:06:26	LouiseMensch That is why, in my view, the only non-Trump candidates who can plausibly emerge from a contested convention are Cruz or Romney

EricaGrieder	711233080627843073	2016-03-19T16:49:15	10. I'm very angry about the way the GOP has failed its supporters, and the country, over the course of this campaign. That's all for now.
EricaGrieder	711231906751209472	2016-03-19T16:44:35	9. I realize people might have read that as a Texan being in the tank for Texas, or my personal bias, but nope. It was just good reporting.
EricaGrieder	711231442622087168	2016-03-19T16:42:44	8. And the thing is, the GOP could have seen this much sooner. I could see it more than a month ago: 
EricaGrieder	711231314649677825	2016-03-19T16:42:14	7. Only in the wake of the March 15th primaries have they realized that they need to coalesce around Cruz to stop Trump.
EricaGrieder	711229745187262464	2016-03-19T16:35:59	6. At the same time, the GOP has been fatally slow to realize that Cruz is the only person who can stop Trump.
EricaGrieder	711229454157160448	2016-03-19T16:34:50	5. Yup. I don't even need to ask CruzCrew to know they've got a plan for this scenario. Since a year ago, probably 
EricaGrieder	711228713258475520	2016-03-19T16:31:53	4. Cruz also has a chance of winning at the convention, if it goes to a second ballot--and no one is better at that kind of masterminding.
EricaGrieder	711227912020602880	2016-03-19T16:28:42	3. In theory, Ted Cruz can overtake Trump still, but realistically...he'll win Utah. Probably not Arizona. (Trump wins the effed-up states.)
EricaGrieder	711226833589547008	2016-03-19T16:24:25	2. At this point it is almost certainly too late to stop Trump from winning.
EricaGrieder	711226531553480704	2016-03-19T16:23:13	1. Ok folks I'd like to say a few words about the GOP's 2016 presidential nomination

EricaGrieder	711023432628965377	2016-03-19T02:56:11	If McConnell can back up the case that Cruz is a liar he should feel free to do so obviously

EricaGrieder	711022878511091712	2016-03-19T02:53:59	Note though: named sources (other than Rove) have good things to say about Cruz; the unnamed ones snipe away freely 
EricaGrieder	711022056289075200	2016-03-19T02:50:43	Re: executive power...not Trump :( W/ Cruz there's a risk of novel arguments but Congress can clap back, presumably  
EricaGrieder	711021238630526977	2016-03-19T02:47:28	yatescr3 I actually didn't see anything specific--do you mean the generalized reports? If so...I mean, those senators can go on record
EricaGrieder	711021009978019841	2016-03-19T02:46:33	Worth noting, too, that Cruz hasn't held a grudge w Graham despite the latter joking about drinking poison etc :) 
EricaGrieder	711019919152795648	2016-03-19T02:42:13	So...I'm not sure how Cruz can fix his reputation but if you're in Congress, my advice would be just shoot straight w him, he'll do the same
EricaGrieder	711018859604541440	2016-03-19T02:38:00	4) Cruz has been a leading advocate for the constitutional separation of powers, aka presidents staying in their lane, for like ten years.
EricaGrieder	711017922869628932	2016-03-19T02:34:17	3) It's increasingly hard for me to disagree with Cruz's generalized scorn for the Washington cartel, which is passively nominating Trump
EricaGrieder	711017144083832832	2016-03-19T02:31:11	2) In reporting, I've found a consistent pattern: Cruz is contemptuous of dishonesty, not disagreement. (He disdains McConnell, not Coburn)
EricaGrieder	711016243612921856	2016-03-19T02:27:37	However, 1) Sources who have worked with or--notably--for Cruz in his post-GWB yrs like &amp; respect him. I seriously can't name an exception.
EricaGrieder	711014998890254336	2016-03-19T02:22:40	And since I am not a senator or former colleague of any kind, I can't speak to whether Cruz is, in fact, horrible to work with.
EricaGrieder	711014079364595712	2016-03-19T02:19:01	First of all: the question is valid. Senate drama aside, Cruz has 0 legislative experience prior to 2012: 
EricaGrieder	711013561783300099	2016-03-19T02:16:57	Apologies, I RT'd the parts of the question out of order. In short: how does Cruz fix his reputation as someone Congress can't work with?
EricaGrieder	711009683360903168	2016-03-19T02:01:33	EricaGrieder how can Cruz fix that AND how can others be made to see it? Ideologically he's really right in conservative mainstream 3/3
EricaGrieder	711009125530992641	2016-03-19T01:59:20	EricaGrieder, since you are the Cruz expert, a question. I am a big Rubio supporter but NeverTrump so fully CruzCrew 1/3
EricaGrieder	711009350412795904	2016-03-19T02:00:13	EricaGrieder I don't think you would disagree that Cruz has the same ends as most conservatives, problem seems to be means 2/3
EricaGrieder	711012245375885312	2016-03-19T02:11:43	This is a good question, so I'm gonna RT all three parts and then answer.  
EricaGrieder	710983166794670080	2016-03-19T00:16:11	Wait, isn't Cruz the poisoning, Trump the shooting? Serious question. Cc sengraham2016 - please advise  
EricaGrieder	710964365436915712	2016-03-18T23:01:28	If Cruz were as blindly, willfully, nihilistically antagonistic as the establishment insists he is- yeah. He would.

EricaGrieder	710599833904488449	2016-03-17T22:52:57	EricaGrieder - Perry's WSJopinion  &amp; PressClubDC speech v Trump was one of most positive aspects of 2016 cycle.

EricaGrieder	710595574416809985	2016-03-17T22:36:01	You draw Trump's ire by threatening his fragile ego. Trump went birther on Cruz back in January bc of the polls 
EricaGrieder	710594746670919680	2016-03-17T22:32:44	eleventy17 No, I reached that a month ago, because after South Carolina it was pretty obviously down to Trump or Cruz.
EricaGrieder	710594494920404993	2016-03-17T22:31:44	19. So, on balance, I much preferred the integrity and clarity Rick Perry showed about Trump. But if Perry can forgive Cruz, so can I.
EricaGrieder	710594097497542656	2016-03-17T22:30:09	18. And one last point in this heavily qualified defense: It remains the case that Cruz is not worse than Trump.
EricaGrieder	710593864751456257	2016-03-17T22:29:14	17. Plus, Cruz was trying to curry favor with Trump's supporters, not Trump. (Cruz Rule 10.) Keep your friends close &amp; your enemies closer.
EricaGrieder	710592430035218432	2016-03-17T22:23:32	16. Also, Cruz didn't *help* Trump with these compliments. Trump was the frontrunner well before Cruz made overtures to him.
EricaGrieder	710591896872050688	2016-03-17T22:21:25	15. Plus, Cruz's campaign is the only reason the GOP still has a chance to stop Trump at a contested convention, even.
EricaGrieder	710591107671793664	2016-03-17T22:18:16	14. As a result, if this goes to a contested convention, Cruz is the alternative most likely to be accepted (peacefully) by Trump supporters
EricaGrieder	710589550414815232	2016-03-17T22:12:05	13. That is, I make no defense of Cruz's motives. But by calling Trump "terrific", he expressed respect for Trump's supporters, too.
EricaGrieder	710589313172418560	2016-03-17T22:11:09	12. And, I've reluctantly started to think that Cruz's embrace of Trump was defensible, albeit only from a consequentialist point of view.
EricaGrieder	710588023121969153	2016-03-17T22:06:01	11. That bothers me profoundly. Leaders should care about the people, even when it doesn't have obvious implications for their own interests
EricaGrieder	710586763262107648	2016-03-17T22:01:01	10. Notice that two months later, that's still true. GOP elites are fretful about what Trump supporters might *do*, not what would help them
EricaGrieder	710586368649334784	2016-03-17T21:59:26	9. Among the many appalling aspects these conversations: I never heard a word of concern from the R operatives about the Trump supporters.
EricaGrieder	710586051316678656	2016-03-17T21:58:11	8. Their reasoning was basically that Trump doesn't REALLY mean the things he's saying, that come right down to it, he'll make deals.
EricaGrieder	710585662857019392	2016-03-17T21:56:38	7. But I started to soften the week before the Iowa caucus, thanks to all the Republican operatives saying they'd prefer Trump to Cruz.
EricaGrieder	710585348267515904	2016-03-17T21:55:23	6. I retained my high-minded objections even after realizing, in November, that Cruz would beat Trump in Iowa: 
EricaGrieder	710584675786317824	2016-03-17T21:52:43	5. Regardless, Cruz's embrace of Trump was, in my view, thru the fall, almost unforgivable. That's pandering--the kind that creates Trumps.
EricaGrieder	710583822933295104	2016-03-17T21:49:20	4. And in Cruz's case, the strategic calculation may have been accompanied by some mischief: his contempt for the establishment is sincere
EricaGrieder	710583102897192964	2016-03-17T21:46:28	3. It was clearly strategic--Katamari Cruz--and based on a nearly universal  underlying premise (that Trump would implode/be defeated)
EricaGrieder	710582554915524608	2016-03-17T21:44:17	2. As you can tell from that post, I *hated* Cruz's cozying up to Trump, which continued thru December with that "Trump is terrific" tweet.
EricaGrieder	710582171149336576	2016-03-17T21:42:46	1. Republicans, I'd like to offer a few thoughts about "Ted Cruz's Trump problem," which I wrote about in August:

EricaGrieder	710292704245186560	2016-03-17T02:32:31	ElazarFine yeah, agree. Or vote him up if Trump is actually the nominee at that point, rather than risk whoever Trump comes up with
EricaGrieder	710292246252363777	2016-03-17T02:30:42	jagfannn BettinaVLA Rubio, for his part, went after Cruz--before he went after Trump, &amp; when he, Rubio, had no plan to actually win.
EricaGrieder	710291738351505409	2016-03-17T02:28:41	jagfannn BettinaVLA With that said, Cruz did call out Trump before Rubio (see the Jan debate) &amp; has "handled" him many times since Iowa
EricaGrieder	710291286474027008	2016-03-17T02:26:53	jagfannn BettinaVLA ok I don't know what you mean by "you guys" but there were not crickets from me. August:

EricaGrieder	710290286358958080	2016-03-17T02:22:55	Plus, Cruz's criticism that Trump would nominate a Garland type is awkward alongside his insistence that the next president should choose.
EricaGrieder	710289027098869760	2016-03-17T02:17:55	"The People will decide"- no. The People don't vote on SCOTUS justices. That's why conservatives are always talking about "unelected judges"
EricaGrieder	710288792461164544	2016-03-17T02:16:59	Cruz's statement on Merrick Garland is, in keeping with Rule 5, cleverly argued yet inane: 
EricaGrieder	710270073383084032	2016-03-17T01:02:36	jagfannn BettinaVLA so: I understand it's disappointing but lashing out at Cruz is silly: without him, no contested convention even
EricaGrieder	710269086211641344	2016-03-17T00:58:40	jagfannn BettinaVLA yes, a contested convention- thanks in part to people who spent six weeks hyping  marcomentum while Trump's lead grew
