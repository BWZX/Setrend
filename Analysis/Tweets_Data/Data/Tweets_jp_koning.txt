jp_koning	686610546209243136	2016-01-11T18:08:05	IvanTheK  I'm thinking in terms of single name term loans.
jp_koning	686607882759057409	2016-01-11T17:57:30	IvanTheK They could prepay the loan.
jp_koning	686602481007214592	2016-01-11T17:36:02	IvanTheK Ok, but if the term loan is fixed rate, wouldn't a borrower be willing to pay a premium relative to a non-callable loan?
jp_koning	686591514844229632	2016-01-11T16:52:28	IvanTheK Why not? Are the odds just really low, or are they genuinely zero?

jp_koning	686577850623856640	2016-01-11T15:58:10	IvanTheK At least a few basis points, no? Fairly certain ≠ certain. A term borrow provides true certainty.
jp_koning	686576670023794689	2016-01-11T15:53:28	IvanTheK If everyone is lending on a callable basis, shouldn't funds who lend non-callable be able to extract a premium?
jp_koning	686574040731914240	2016-01-11T15:43:01	IvanTheK Are funds lending on fixed non-callable basis, or are their loans callable?
