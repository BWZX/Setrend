kltblom	710526633120129026	2016-03-17T18:02:04	jdavidsonlawyer it's ridiculous. Today it is trivial to build a cheap investment portfolio from basic ingredients.
kltblom	710525964791328768	2016-03-17T17:59:25	kltblom  Almost daily I see people with portfolios that are "out performing" or "under performing"now but are guaranteed a random outcome.

kltblom	710518379736469505	2016-03-17T17:29:17	kltblom If you run a Hedge Fund, black box AI or discretionary human, incentives are dependent on recent performance/happy clients.

kltblom	710517204446371844	2016-03-17T17:24:36	kltblom There are many ways to deal with such a problem. It all depends on what the goal is. 'Outperform' is not a goal.
