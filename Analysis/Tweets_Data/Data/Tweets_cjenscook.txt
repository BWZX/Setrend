cjenscook	716626688982040576	2016-04-03T14:01:31	izakaminska Frances_Coppola Credit requires a basis in value. That may be an asset basis (funding) or a people basis (financing)
cjenscook	716626386715295745	2016-04-03T14:00:19	izakaminska Frances_Coppola I'd define financing as distribution of future value eg credit card. Funding as distribution of existing value

cjenscook	682934157912223745	2016-01-01T14:39:26	joabbess US used Saudi financial reserves &amp; passive investor funds to support price. Petrodollar funding a consequence of high $ oil price
cjenscook	682931946876452866	2016-01-01T14:30:39	joabbess This sums up my view 
cjenscook	682931573935730691	2016-01-01T14:29:10	joabbess I think US used petrodollars from supported price to fund cheap loans. Shale oil gave US energy independence from Saudis
