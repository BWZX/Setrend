IyerC	717260214991458304	2016-04-05T07:58:55	iliassiak NickMalkoutzis eschizas Greece has already had a few rounds of NPV debt relief - and will have many more
IyerC	717260014377893888	2016-04-05T07:58:08	NickMalkoutzis eschizas on the other hand less austerity helps NOW. Literally more to spend on much needed life support, keep econ going.
IyerC	717259828859637760	2016-04-05T07:57:23	NickMalkoutzis eschizas I mean think abt it - how will cutting 20y debt help 60% youth unemp, struggling pensioners - how?
IyerC	717259359990988800	2016-04-05T07:55:32	NickMalkoutzis eschizas the only thing misleading is the claim that debt relief is the central issue. Guess Varoufakis has won.
IyerC	717259227627171840	2016-04-05T07:55:00	NickMalkoutzis eschizas EU debt interest is deferred. GGB debt interest is basically 0. What are u gng to gain by haircut of debt?
IyerC	717259060568072192	2016-04-05T07:54:20	NickMalkoutzis eschizas do you have a breakdown of that 5.9bln - try excluding IMF payments...
IyerC	717258688659111936	2016-04-05T07:52:52	pdragoumis eschizas NickMalkoutzis so Greek govt should focus on getting those in place- for which relaxation of austerity is essential
IyerC	717258546895839233	2016-04-05T07:52:18	pdragoumis eschizas NickMalkoutzis and official debt never gets repaid - it gets deferred repeatedly and eroded by growth/inflation
IyerC	717258394181246980	2016-04-05T07:51:41	pdragoumis eschizas NickMalkoutzis even the IMF doesnt look at debt stock as a measure of sustainability- its outdated now.
IyerC	717258241303048192	2016-04-05T07:51:05	pdragoumis eschizas NickMalkoutzis it is and it isnt. Greece issued twice in 2014 at 3.5% and 4.75%. Investors know debt mostly official.
IyerC	717257955947724800	2016-04-05T07:49:57	NickMalkoutzis eschizas you'd rather hv crushing fiscal targets now &amp; not have to pay something 20y in future (that will b rolled anyway?)
IyerC	717256773703507968	2016-04-05T07:45:15	Will Greece ever repay its debts? Yes as soon as US, Japan do theirs.
IyerC	717256304406999040	2016-04-05T07:43:23	eschizas NickMalkoutzis what should matter to Greece is cashflow - not notional debt owed 30y in the future
IyerC	717256174115102720	2016-04-05T07:42:52	eschizas NickMalkoutzis er this is absolutely the right thing to do for Greece. The debt stock is irrelevant as long as servicing is easy.
