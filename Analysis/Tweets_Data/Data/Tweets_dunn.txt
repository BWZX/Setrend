dunn	708072140868886532	2016-03-10T23:28:48	The Century Foundation did a study showing poor white families are less likely to live in poor neighborhoods than non-poor black families.
dunn	708071780234240002	2016-03-10T23:27:22	The craziest part is that even if you're black and not poor, you're more likely to live in a poor neighborhood than your white counterpart.
dunn	708071127021658112	2016-03-10T23:24:46	Concentrated poverty for black people is due to systemic discrimination, public housing, and zoning laws that keep the poor out of suburbs.
dunn	708070084871397376	2016-03-10T23:20:38	According to NYU sociologist Patrick Sharkey, 66% of black people in US live in high-poverty neighborhoods while 94% of white people do not.
dunn	708069517965049856	2016-03-10T23:18:23	A five year study in Chicago found that poor black families are 10x more likely to live in areas of concentrated poverty than poor whites.
dunn	708068849283952645	2016-03-10T23:15:43	Poor black families are more likely to live in places where other families are poor. Sociologists call this the "double burden" of poverty.
dunn	708068516658806785	2016-03-10T23:14:24	In order to have an honest conversation on poverty, we have to reckon with the fact that black &amp; white poverty are fundamentally different.
