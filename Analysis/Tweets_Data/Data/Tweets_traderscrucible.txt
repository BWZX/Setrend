traderscrucible	707937503051812864	2016-03-10T14:33:48	morganwarstler  so we will put that in my column, ok?
traderscrucible	707937408268902400	2016-03-10T14:33:25	morganwarstler  but you seem to have granted me that Trump is using the worst people in the U.S. as a core constituency for this campaign.

traderscrucible	705831352667475968	2016-03-04T19:04:42	shishiqiushi I think one of the big causes of the tech bubble in the 2000s was internet stocks became more like money in some situations.
