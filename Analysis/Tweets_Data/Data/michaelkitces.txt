michaelkitces	715606243369426944	2016-03-31T18:26:38	PhilBoscarino You're assuming that as AI improves, advisors won't change and evolve their service model too. gweirydd
michaelkitces	715605673623613442	2016-03-31T18:24:22	PhilBoscarino Everyone said same in 1999. No more financial advisors, young people will buy stocks online. Advisors still here. gweirydd

michaelkitces	715605019970678784	2016-03-31T18:21:46	gweirydd The point is not "tech isn't useful". The point is "tech isn't competition, it's complementary and augmenting."
michaelkitces	715604926085390336	2016-03-31T18:21:24	gweirydd Right, so advisors can serve more clients, more effectively, and have more successful businesses. Exactly as tech always has.
michaelkitces	715604730647617538	2016-03-31T18:20:37	gweirydd Robo-advisor tools don't take market share from actual advisors. It's technology advisors can use, just as .coms were. pmarca
michaelkitces	715604624644968448	2016-03-31T18:20:12	gweirydd In other words, my prediction is "robo-advisor technology will be the standard that every HUMAN advisor uses in 10 years." pmarca
michaelkitces	715604386811129856	2016-03-31T18:19:15	gweirydd We don't have robo-psycho-therapists either. There's a reason.
michaelkitces	715604334386524161	2016-03-31T18:19:03	gweirydd There's a fundamental difference between machines that make widgets and the human-to-human dynamics of advice.
michaelkitces	715603491612450816	2016-03-31T18:15:42	.gweirydd Look at the growth of advisory industry in past 20 years. It is BOOMING, directly parallel the rise of techonlogy tools! pmarca
michaelkitces	715603375585378304	2016-03-31T18:15:14	gweirydd Yes, tech will make it simpler, easier, faster, better. And advisors will THRIVE in that environment. Thanks to the tech. pmarca
michaelkitces	715603232719024129	2016-03-31T18:14:40	gweirydd The technology doesn't replace the advisor. It AUGMENTS the advisor. And it doesn't solve the distribution challenge. pmarca
michaelkitces	715603124849930243	2016-03-31T18:14:14	gweirydd Take EVERYTHING you said. Put it in a computer. Give THAT to an advisor. Now you have a more efficient valuable advisor. pmarca
michaelkitces	715603046550650880	2016-03-31T18:13:56	gweirydd The point was that if you're listing the things a computer does, you're missing the value the advisor actually provides. pmarca
michaelkitces	715602820611907584	2016-03-31T18:13:02	gweirydd The technology will survive, tech always marches on. The purported disruption just isn't happening. Wrong product fit. pmarca
michaelkitces	715602671701532674	2016-03-31T18:12:26	gweirydd The sad thing is these challenges for robos was entirely predictable, but they didn't research the marketplace first. pmarca
michaelkitces	715602566416109568	2016-03-31T18:12:01	gweirydd Look at the landscape. Multiple robos acquired for advisors. Asset managers building them. Existing robos pivoting. pmarca
michaelkitces	715602479900176384	2016-03-31T18:11:41	gweirydd Robos spend $800 to acquire a client paying $60/year is a fundamentally broken business model. pmarca
michaelkitces	715602301046693888	2016-03-31T18:10:58	gweirydd Right. So 90s tech didn't replace advisors, It's used by advisors for greater efficiency. Robos going the same path. pmarca
michaelkitces	715602130309087232	2016-03-31T18:10:17	gweirydd You might spend some further time looking at the advisor landscape and what advisors actually do if you think that's all. pmarca
michaelkitces	715601941997494274	2016-03-31T18:09:32	gweirydd Why would it change? To what? That's what it changed TO when established players adopted the tools to existing models. pmarca
michaelkitces	715601704666972160	2016-03-31T18:08:36	gweirydd Client acquisition costs. Some robos rumored to be spending $800 to acquire client that pays ~$60/year in AUM fees. BOOM pmarca

michaelkitces	715601111995060225	2016-03-31T18:06:14	FinTechie Because they're planning their own new from-scratch proprietary solution instead? :)
michaelkitces	715600920793452544	2016-03-31T18:05:29	gweirydd The 1% AUM fee was historically an asset manager distribution charge, and robos had no disruptive plan for lower CAC. pmarca
michaelkitces	715600803344547841	2016-03-31T18:05:01	gweirydd Robo-advisors misunderstood the fundamental pricing dynamics in the AUM marketplace. pmarca

michaelkitces	715600479519121408	2016-03-31T18:03:44	gweirydd At this point it's primarily just a distribution channel for asset managers. That's a very old model, not new disruption. pmarca

michaelkitces	715201887373508608	2016-03-30T15:39:52	MeghnaWBUR Possible it gets mixed up. Although I find once you watch for it, you may see it really is often used in 'correct' reference.
michaelkitces	715193281815134208	2016-03-30T15:05:40	MeghnaWBUR In practice, I find that IS how it's typically used by the media though. Mid-day "futures" usually refers back to pre-market?
michaelkitces	715193137279406081	2016-03-30T15:05:06	MeghnaWBUR But yes as typically used in media, should be "The Dow" during trading hours, and "Dow futures" in after- or pre-market trading.

michaelkitces	713743678288871428	2016-03-26T15:05:28	.SEIMissyP Millennials won't live in a tech-savvy nursing home w/ iPads. They won't use a tech-savvy retiree-centric advisor, either.
michaelkitces	713743517298909184	2016-03-26T15:04:49	SEIMissyP The real issue is who the firm is built to serve, and what service model they provide to deliver it. For Millennials? Or not?
michaelkitces	713743374768058369	2016-03-26T15:04:15	SEIMissyP You can have young advisors in your firm, delivering retirement advice to retired clients. Still irrelevant for Millennials. :/
michaelkitces	713743294468063233	2016-03-26T15:03:56	SEIMissyP The issue isn't young advisors at the firm, its a service model for young clients.

michaelkitces	713739799862124548	2016-03-26T14:50:03	SEIMissyP That aside, for many advisors the biggest problem isn't that they alienate the kids, it's that they alienate the wife. &lt;sigh&gt; :/
michaelkitces	713739633612431360	2016-03-26T14:49:23	SEIMissyP Yes, fair point there and I don't disagree. But what if advisors DO that and 90%+ of Millennials leave ANYWAY? Mismatch
michaelkitces	713735776807182337	2016-03-26T14:34:04	SEIMissyP My grandmother's nursing home can build a great relationship with me. I'm still not filling her empty nursing home room later.

michaelkitces	697890442722086912	2016-02-11T21:10:22	soniasimone So there's at least SOME cannibalization of low-quality Pulse traffic w/ higher-quality activity feed clicks. PhilGerb
michaelkitces	697890361528741889	2016-02-11T21:10:03	soniasimone So when we eliminated Pulse posts, the CTR from LI activity feed went UP, which was good b/c it converts better. PhilGerb
michaelkitces	697890279014195202	2016-02-11T21:09:43	soniasimone Secondary issue we saw last time was people who saw articles on Pulse did NOT click through to our site from feed. PhilGerb

michaelkitces	697874902280437760	2016-02-11T20:08:37	PhilGerb But if big publishers have a bigger slice of the pie now and LI algo will favor them more, isn't that bad for typical advisor?
michaelkitces	697874113310912512	2016-02-11T20:05:29	PhilGerb Not trying to be cagey. It's just that the feed is a limited space. If big publishers are now winning, who's losing/replaced?
michaelkitces	697874022403567616	2016-02-11T20:05:07	PhilGerb Ok but if Pulse tweaked the algo to favor big publishers again, doesn't that mean small publishers will see LESS now?

michaelkitces	697870114436337665	2016-02-11T19:49:35	PhilGerb Obviously it wasn't a total 1:1 exchange and cannibalization, but it was material.
michaelkitces	697869670913859584	2016-02-11T19:47:49	PhilGerb Pulse posts were actually partially cannibalizing the CTR on Activity Links. Which matters since the latter converted far better.
michaelkitces	697869448066293760	2016-02-11T19:46:56	PhilGerb We found a very material uptick in site traffic from LinkedIn when we STOPPED Pulse posts and JUST posted activity links.
michaelkitces	697869336120311808	2016-02-11T19:46:30	PhilGerb Something you add as a Pulse instead of an activity link does replacing some of your traffic activity. Not purely an add.
michaelkitces	697868978732081152	2016-02-11T19:45:04	PhilGerb Again, I'm not just talking theories here. We did this. For a long time. And tested. And it was grossly inferior.
michaelkitces	697868442590912512	2016-02-11T19:42:57	PhilGerb Yes, except we tested and found LI Pulse + CTA converted *WAY* less than blog post + CTA.
michaelkitces	697866875468955648	2016-02-11T19:36:43	PhilGerb Just because you cast your reel INTO the LinkedIn waters doesn't mean you need to stand over there to reel them in.
michaelkitces	697866764827435008	2016-02-11T19:36:17	PhilGerb I'm just saying to reel them in, you need your feet firmly planted in your own boat. :)
michaelkitces	697866216061460480	2016-02-11T19:34:06	soniasimone Original question was about cross-posting content to LI. That's the only part I was ever objecting to. ShareCropping PhilGerb
michaelkitces	697865821138382849	2016-02-11T19:32:32	soniasimone The point is about what you're accomplishing there as a part of your marketing process, &amp; sharecropping risks. PhilGerb
michaelkitces	697865714531700736	2016-02-11T19:32:06	soniasimone I certainly didn't say "LI useful never". I have 5,000+ connections and engage there HEAVILY. PhilGerb
michaelkitces	697865483362689024	2016-02-11T19:31:11	soniasimone Well, &amp; I'm agreeing with it as a channel to distribute links to blog content. Just that duplication is problematic. PhilGerb
michaelkitces	697865017178398722	2016-02-11T19:29:20	soniasimone Yes, but the opportunity cost risk for sharecropping and having the landlord change the terms is even worse. :/ PhilGerb
michaelkitces	697864855089504256	2016-02-11T19:28:41	PhilGerb Social media followers and raw traffic stats are vanity. Mailing list conversions related most directly to biz dev results.
michaelkitces	697864718288027651	2016-02-11T19:28:09	PhilGerb Business development results didn't really manifest until we improved process to drive mailing list sign-ups though.
michaelkitces	697864559462322176	2016-02-11T19:27:31	PhilGerb Not that social media traffic didn't grow. It's certainly up too. But organic search growth to blog became exponential.
michaelkitces	697863559443849216	2016-02-11T19:23:32	PhilGerb Traffic that started 3:1 social:organic in year 1 was 1:1 by year 3 and is now 1:5 the other way by year 5. Even w/ 27k followers.
michaelkitces	697863324306898944	2016-02-11T19:22:36	PhilGerb Although in practice, I've found that the brand equity grows so quickly that organic search growth actually outpaced social.
michaelkitces	697863141003288576	2016-02-11T19:21:53	PhilGerb The larger your social footprint, the more capability to drive traffic to your digital real estate. Social supports the blog.
michaelkitces	697862974502019072	2016-02-11T19:21:13	PhilGerb Yes absolutely time on social continues to build, but I find that directly correlated to rising traffic to website.
michaelkitces	697862314570227712	2016-02-11T19:18:36	PhilGerb If LinkedIn rolls out requirement to pay for reach in 2017, where's the advisor's marketing plan? soniasimone
michaelkitces	697862083451482112	2016-02-11T19:17:41	PhilGerb Building the equity of your own digital presence and mailing list is FAR harder to lose. Not prone to LI algo change. soniasimone
michaelkitces	697861942388641792	2016-02-11T19:17:07	PhilGerb Yes, but again that's my point. What someone else's algo gives you today, can be taken away tomorrow. soniasimone
michaelkitces	697861612993167360	2016-02-11T19:15:48	PhilGerb I find few who advocate for one side or the other ever actually did BOTH and measured results of BOTH side-by-side. soniasimone
michaelkitces	697861475088625664	2016-02-11T19:15:15	PhilGerb Indeed, I tried both for two years, and measured carefully. LI results were so bad by comparison, dropped Pulse. soniasimone
michaelkitces	697861291986325506	2016-02-11T19:14:32	PhilGerb Yes, my point is just that writing on blog and sharing link on LI gives them a more sustainable growth path.

michaelkitces	697860192420155392	2016-02-11T19:10:10	PhilGerb The difference is one of those builds your equity, the other is entirely subject to LI future changes. soniasimone
michaelkitces	697860083213066241	2016-02-11T19:09:44	PhilGerb Right, but the same is true of a blog. The "app" is email or Feedly or Zite, and the search is Google/Yahoo/Bing. soniasimone
michaelkitces	697859929844146177	2016-02-11T19:09:07	PhilGerb I see close to 500 monthly profile views on LinkedIn thanks to search. But drive by profile, not Pulse articles. soniasimone
michaelkitces	697859610443718657	2016-02-11T19:07:51	PhilGerb Well, the advisor's PROFILE is still there to be found in search, regarding of Pulse articles. soniasimone
michaelkitces	697858459400802308	2016-02-11T19:03:16	PhilGerb Indeed, FB has reinvented its feed algos several times as well. Still the same problem - more writers, limited feed? soniasimone
michaelkitces	697858222531723265	2016-02-11T19:02:20	GabeMuller_ Thanks Gabe. Was that a suggestion or a hint? :) &lt;3 AmexOPEN
michaelkitces	697858043351080960	2016-02-11T19:01:37	PhilGerb From what I've seen, Pulse reach seems to decline every month more people push content there? Same problem as FB? soniasimone
michaelkitces	697857804112158725	2016-02-11T19:00:40	PhilGerb Understood. My point is that they can get MORE by not doing so, and have less risk if LI someday charges for content. soniasimone
michaelkitces	697857753390432256	2016-02-11T19:00:28	Getting ready to work on Weekend Reading - what's the best industry (or other?) article you read this week?
michaelkitces	697857677695832064	2016-02-11T19:00:10	PhilGerb And again, the problem with putting the content to LinkedIn is little way to put prospects through a funnel. :/ soniasimone
michaelkitces	697857511643291650	2016-02-11T18:59:30	PhilGerb I don't count clicks alone, they're meaningless. I do count clicks that take people into funnel that I know converts. soniasimone
michaelkitces	697857272358309891	2016-02-11T18:58:33	PhilGerb The question is how many of those people would have clicked a link TO the original on their website anyway? soniasimone
michaelkitces	697857128539807745	2016-02-11T18:57:59	I have to tweet more when I'm not at T32016, it's the only way for me to engage in absentia! :)  
michaelkitces	697856978069102593	2016-02-11T18:57:23	soniasimone So driving people from LinkedIn to your site rarely eliminates people actually interested in doing business anyway. PhilGerb
michaelkitces	697856887648296960	2016-02-11T18:57:02	soniasimone Not the least because anyone who's serious about doing business w/ us was going to click through anyway. PhilGerb
michaelkitces	697856814264774656	2016-02-11T18:56:44	soniasimone But we do have ample internal data that activity conversion is FAR worse on LinkedIn than pulling to our site. PhilGerb
michaelkitces	697856652918308864	2016-02-11T18:56:06	soniasimone With unlimited resources, I'd just repurpose every article to every possible platform and measure what works. :) PhilGerb
michaelkitces	697856459359592448	2016-02-11T18:55:20	soniasimone Particularly in our context, since most advisors do NOT have the kind of resources for extensive multi-purposing. PhilGerb
michaelkitces	697856287137263616	2016-02-11T18:54:39	soniasimone Obviously Facebook is still viable as a platform, but building their equity helped them, not the brand's. PhilGerb
michaelkitces	697856074985111552	2016-02-11T18:53:48	soniasimone This was the same discussion in 2012-2013 about Facebook. Then they squeezed the algorithm &amp; brands got slammed. PhilGerb
michaelkitces	697855982735638528	2016-02-11T18:53:26	soniasimone Understood, but the fundamental principle of whether you're building or digital sharecropping remains relevant. PhilGerb
michaelkitces	697855046248239104	2016-02-11T18:49:43	soniasimone Interesting, perhaps they've improved detection on this issue since I went through it a year ago? PhilGerb
michaelkitces	697851772560392193	2016-02-11T18:36:42	I wonder - isn't the 'slow' 15% stock market decline since mid-2015 exactly how Yellen wants a modest rate increase scenario to play out??
