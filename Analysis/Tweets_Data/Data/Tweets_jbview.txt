jbview	720379159244062720	2016-04-13T22:32:30	MattGrossmann Yes. All depends on (1) how many solid Cruzers, and (2) whether others prefer Cruz to chaos. I think it's too soon to know.
jbview	720367007435251713	2016-04-13T21:44:13	Fyodor32768 Exactly. The reporting is really mixed on this. We don't know enough yet.
jbview	720353860007673856	2016-04-13T20:51:58	Yup, a plan "C" candidate could (but probably won't) win the GOP nomination. Here's how:

jbview	720286710446366720	2016-04-13T16:25:08	joshHuder cgoodmantx ...technically I'd say the problem is not trying to do approps, not failing to do budget. YMMV.

jbview	720285818158493696	2016-04-13T16:21:35	MattGrossmann If Trump doesn't have 1237 bound/committed, and Cruz doesn't have 1237 loyalists, we could get deadlock, 3rd candidate
jbview	720285609210822656	2016-04-13T16:20:46	MattGrossmann Yeah, but item is in editing right now! But basically...
jbview	720285191114268672	2016-04-13T16:19:06	cgoodmantx joshHuder But they could do approps bills w/out a budget. Sort of.
jbview	720284236218044417	2016-04-13T16:15:18	joshHuder And, yeah, it's a GOP Congress, so no excuse. But they do have a budget deal, so budget is somewhat superfluous.
jbview	720283231665405952	2016-04-13T16:11:19	DaveScottSC Yup. That's certainly true. But mostly the attacks that were wrong, not what he's doing now.
jbview	720281623896264704	2016-04-13T16:04:55	Mostly true.

jbview	718506846445772800	2016-04-08T18:32:36	MattGrossmann Yes. I should have said: pre-convention matters only if it's still open after 6/7...
jbview	718504950276427778	2016-04-08T18:25:03	EricaGrieder Doesn't that imply yes, he'll do whatever he can do to win, no matter how ugly it looks?
jbview	718504650677362688	2016-04-08T18:23:52	MattGrossmann Then after 6/7/pre-Cleveland big shifts would be mainly if the party sends strong signal one way or another.

jbview	718503188777811971	2016-04-08T18:18:04	EricaGrieder Big q to me is if Trump has 1237 bound but Cruz has 1237 loyal delegates, would Cruz change the rules to free them?
jbview	718501474351845376	2016-04-08T18:11:15	MattGrossmann I think we're talking past each other? Are you talking pre-June7 , or post?

jbview	718500777610883074	2016-04-08T18:08:29	EricaGrieder Could be wrong, but I think that was an attempt to strangle Cruz on the assumption Trump would lose anyway.
jbview	718499108479242240	2016-04-08T18:01:51	EricaGrieder I think most GOP party actors prefer Cruz to Trump at this point, no?
jbview	718497577054904320	2016-04-08T17:55:46	EricaGrieder I actually don't think the party will go Trump on June 8 if he's at 1236, so we won't know.
jbview	718496650755489792	2016-04-08T17:52:05	MattGrossmann Delegate allocation even more than selection, but yes. If Trump is 1150-1236 and party opposes him, Cruz is likely winner.
jbview	718495224717254656	2016-04-08T17:46:25	EricaGrieder I think Rubio is a politician...if the party goes for Trump, I don't think he resists.

jbview	715955209311285249	2016-04-01T17:33:18	DemfromTX Within the convention, worst he could do is force a non-unanimous 1st ballot. Would be clear after a test vote.
jbview	715952675439919108	2016-04-01T17:23:14	MattGlassman312 I'm pretty sure only a handful are bound *and can't be released*.
jbview	715952534905569280	2016-04-01T17:22:40	MattGlassman312 No. If Rubio/Kasich release their delegates and endorse, and delegates go along = 1st ballot win.
jbview	715952265014730752	2016-04-01T17:21:36	MattGlassman312 Ah, OK. Unless, of course, there's a real deadlock. Which is possible. Sorry if I misread you.
jbview	715951182498381824	2016-04-01T17:17:18	imillhiser Yes. Very hard to imagine a pre-convention, or pre-balloting, deal for anyone else.
jbview	715950794386882561	2016-04-01T17:15:45	jonmladd jbouie Not just party orgs. State, local, and Congressional candidacies. Very doable in many cases.
jbview	715950391746232320	2016-04-01T17:14:09	Fyodor32768 Possible. But more likely even Kasich would go along if it was clear Cruz wins on 2nd ballot.
jbview	715950066893193216	2016-04-01T17:12:52	imillhiser Steps are: 1 candidate demonstrates certain 2nd-ballot win. Then party rallies to assure 1st-ballot win. Loser not part of deal
jbview	715949689108099072	2016-04-01T17:11:22	derek_maclean Why there's a plausible chance of a deadlock - GOPers may be willing to endure it for a chance at better
jbview	715945359260925952	2016-04-01T16:54:09	derek_maclean But that probably happens no matter how he loses. So might as well at least allow a scripted convention.
jbview	715945058378334208	2016-04-01T16:52:58	Fyodor32768 If that looks certain, Rubio/Kasich/uncommitteds all going to Cruz is a cleaner end IMO.
jbview	715944487764238337	2016-04-01T16:50:42	Although granted neither Cruz nor Trump inclined to play nice if they lose (as RWR in GOP '76 and EMK in Dem '80 did).
jbview	715944058221367298	2016-04-01T16:48:59	And even if uncertainty requires a vote to determine where delegates are, best to arrange an early test vote, so winner can script the rest
jbview	715943685003812864	2016-04-01T16:47:30	So any "clear in advance" 2-ballot arrangement probably gets reduced to a 1-ballot deal. While if there's no deal, then deadlock is likely.
jbview	715943389032800256	2016-04-01T16:46:20	For the party, *much* better to get any gettable deals before the gavel comes down on day 1.
jbview	715943123281649665	2016-04-01T16:45:16	...with Rubio/Kasich endorsing, and most unbounds committing, and allowing Cruz to organize the convention.
jbview	715942804145508354	2016-04-01T16:44:00	While if Cruz has a done deal to win on 2nd ballot, party would do what it can to lock it before convention begins...
jbview	715942568379424768	2016-04-01T16:43:04	Trump presumably peaks on 1st ballot, right? So he doesn't win on 2nd ballot no matter what.
jbview	715941864076156929	2016-04-01T16:40:16	I think I disagree with this. 
jbview	715913019809796096	2016-04-01T14:45:39	I'm utterly baffled by claims Trump changed anything at all in GOP positioning on immigration.

jbview	713768768812396544	2016-03-26T16:45:10	eliasisquith Basically: Long-term media domination of this kind by Trump could not have happened in, say, 1992.
jbview	713768382760427520	2016-03-26T16:43:38	eliasisquith (remembering...) actually not talking about conservative media here, although that's a part of GOP dysfunction too, of course
jbview	713767996192329729	2016-03-26T16:42:06	NormOrnstein 2 and 3 are correct, 1 isn't - Cruz (large) faction within party eager to embrace him in 2015.

jbview	713766205564325888	2016-03-26T16:34:59	NormOrnstein Cruz to this point has had more support among party actors than among voters.  (Which I missed until December).
jbview	713765983056490496	2016-03-26T16:34:06	NormOrnstein Certainly agree a healthy party wouldn't go for Cruz - but a lot of party actors supported him in '15.

jbview	713764633790779392	2016-03-26T16:28:44	brianbeutler Disagree. Missing changed media norms as big a mistake (on my part) as missing anything else....

jbview	713068747125309444	2016-03-24T18:23:32	jsconway Yes. Possible a Trump landslide loss would yield a better GOP, but just as likely nothing changes or it gets even worse.
jbview	713014181029679104	2016-03-24T14:46:42	Including GOP elites teaching GOP voters that the "Republican Party" is evil and can't be trusted.
jbview	713013766955352066	2016-03-24T14:45:03	Yup - (mis)education of GOP voters by GOP elites over decades remains a major story.  
jbview	712774538090692608	2016-03-23T22:54:27	Kasich would probably perform as a generic GOPer. Unless he campaigned the way he has for the nomination.  
jbview	712764648970457093	2016-03-23T22:15:09	SteveKornacki jbouie ...that's my guess; we'll see what careful studies show.
jbview	712764473187115009	2016-03-23T22:14:27	SteveKornacki jbouie Fair, and, I suspect, correct - turned out (maybe?!?) saturation media coverage can overwhelm party cues. But...
jbview	712763987025334273	2016-03-23T22:12:31	mattmfm Sure. Although if the saturation coverage was for a candidate with a different mix of topics, they might have been less out of step
jbview	712763672439951361	2016-03-23T22:11:16	SteveKornacki jbouie Saturation Jindal or Huck coverage would have given them all their potential voters, plus likely fewer negatives.
jbview	712763271586127874	2016-03-23T22:09:41	SteveKornacki jbouie Yes. Saturation unfiltered Trump means he'll get every voter he can, and the rest will learn they dislike him.
jbview	712762725340946434	2016-03-23T22:07:30	SteveKornacki jbouie ...of course some of that is from primary wins, but started earlier, and CNN esp. has overstated Trump's position.
jbview	712762230450888704	2016-03-23T22:05:32	SteveKornacki jbouie Haven't seen recent data; last I saw Trump's coverage was net positive - remember "he's winning" is positive. Yes...
jbview	712761164380430337	2016-03-23T22:01:18	mattmfm I think there are voters who think he's the anti-immigration, anti-Muslim candidate, when in fact there were more than a dozen.
jbview	712760012981059589	2016-03-23T21:56:44	Somewhat - but hard to blame voters for failing to take into account information they do not have  
jbview	712758923724455936	2016-03-23T21:52:24	SteveKornacki jbouie Bad general election marketing; apparently sufficiently effective nomination marketing.
jbview	712754464617324546	2016-03-23T21:34:41	SteveKornacki "media isn't critical" not the complaint (at least not mine) - it's "media gives him *way* too much unfiltered time."

jbview	710895664218173440	2016-03-18T18:28:28	awprokop You could be correct! My main point was about who decides (candidates/delegates). And that Cruz has a relevant history IMO.
jbview	710895309031919616	2016-03-18T18:27:04	awprokop But not certain to matter in Nov.   Not to mention: this is Cruz, who didn't care about reaction to shutdown.
jbview	710894958396510208	2016-03-18T18:25:40	I wrote about Kasich: 
jbview	710894246715387904	2016-03-18T18:22:50	DucksPerAcre Yup. Or if, say, Kasich's delegates help Cruz on rules, but won't vote for either Trump or Cruz.
jbview	710893263675330564	2016-03-18T18:18:56	awprokop No guarantee the latter would happen, though. 4 years is a long time.
jbview	710891958412124160	2016-03-18T18:13:45	DucksPerAcre Trump could have 1237 allocated delegates, loyal or not, and if so he'll win unless the convention unbinds them.
jbview	710890202609393664	2016-03-18T18:06:46	awprokop I suppose, but if he has the delegates, do you really think he would hesitate?

jbview	710888661638840321	2016-03-18T18:00:39	CarolineBehr Direct election of delegates is pretty rare, though.
jbview	710888328544063488	2016-03-18T17:59:19	15. Some delegates may be party-loyal. But otherwise, "the party" has limited say. It's delegates, and candidates. [end]
jbview	710887790725210112	2016-03-18T17:57:11	14. Just remember that next time "the party" talks about what "they" want at the convention.
jbview	710887410046013440	2016-03-18T17:55:40	13. But we should all expect Cruz to, well, be Ted Cruz leading up to and at the convention. No matter what the consequences for the party.
jbview	710887120651558913	2016-03-18T17:54:31	12. Granted, possible that neither Trump nor Cruz will have 1237 loyal delegates.
jbview	710886787925811200	2016-03-18T17:53:12	11. And Cruz will of course (as all candidates should) be doing whatever he can to pack Rules &amp; Credentials Committees.
jbview	710886203185373184	2016-03-18T17:50:53	10. Does anyone at all believe that if *Ted Cruz* has enough loyal delegates he would back of from moving ahead, no matter what?
jbview	710885805909221376	2016-03-18T17:49:18	9. The candidate who matters? Ted Cruz, perhaps the least likely person in US to respect democracic norms and intent, not letter, of rules
jbview	710885459518476289	2016-03-18T17:47:55	8. RNC, Cong. leaders, donors: No voice. It's really just candidates and delegates.
jbview	710885206476136448	2016-03-18T17:46:55	7. They may be correct! Would indeed be ugly to ignore a clear choice of the voters. However.
jbview	710884834688823296	2016-03-18T17:45:26	6. Most GOP leaders seem to believe changing the rules, unbinding the delegates, and "stealing" the nom from Trump would be a disaster.
jbview	710884532237549569	2016-03-18T17:44:14	5. (For those who haven't caught on yet - GOP delegate allocation and delegate selection are separate processes, only sometimes connected)
jbview	710884333662425088	2016-03-18T17:43:27	4. So now think about the very real possibility Trump may win &gt;1237 allocated delegates, but fewer than 1237 loyal delegates.
jbview	710883813518352384	2016-03-18T17:41:23	3. Only the delegates and candidates decide what rules are changed, which credentials challenges happen, etc.
jbview	710883517513781249	2016-03-18T17:40:12	2. If a candidate has 1237 who want to support him, it's over. If not, not. Moreover....
jbview	710883193033986048	2016-03-18T17:38:55	1. The party doesn't get to declare a contested convention. The players are the delegates and the candidates.

jbview	710596073367191553	2016-03-17T22:38:00	wccubbison Oh, Kasich isn't going to do it, even if he gets every available Rubio/etc. delegate. Which he won't.
jbview	710595641358098435	2016-03-17T22:36:17	More generally: Unbound/uncommitted delegates *will* declare before July 7, and then during pre-convention, and they'll be added to totals.
jbview	710594710793011201	2016-03-17T22:32:35	Example of why "Kasich mathematically can't reach 1,237 by July 7" is false.  
jbview	710567318686978048	2016-03-17T20:43:45	Is there evidence that Kasich voters exist?  
jbview	710555255411490817	2016-03-17T19:55:49	Taniel Agreed. But also true of those who say he's sure to get 1237. Lots of schedule, lots of uncertainty.
jbview	710553087006654464	2016-03-17T19:47:12	*Raises hand* 
jbview	710541879675322368	2016-03-17T19:02:40	Yes. Entirely possible that Trump yields black American-like voting among Hispanics for a generation. 
jbview	710540432019726336	2016-03-17T18:56:54	Just so everybody is clear, JohnKasich and his team are either ignorant of or lying about basic delegate math.

jbview	710170842643243009	2016-03-16T18:28:17	hezaproject Don't think that's right. GOP system not designed as much as just decentralized, and states have an incentive to go WTA.

jbview	709823181494861825	2016-03-15T19:26:49	Maybe there's still some sort of divide the map strategy that works - maybe Cruz plays along if he has a bad day today.

jbview	709822632124923904	2016-03-15T19:24:38	Advantage of 3rd party is once you've done that, harder to backslide - vs. fight to the convention and then sit on their hands.
jbview	709822307552915456	2016-03-15T19:23:20	If NeverTrump asked me? Better to go after the nomination (still might work) than go 3rd party, regardless of today's results.

jbview	700099728340606976	2016-02-17T23:29:17	We really don't know Trump's floor or ceiling. We get clues from polling and etc., but that's all. Really do have to play it out to see.
jbview	700099285577297920	2016-02-17T23:27:31	So every point up for down for Trump (in reality, not individual polls) is a very big deal. And...
jbview	700099031930966016	2016-02-17T23:26:31	Anyway, the other thing. If it's a 3-way race, the difference between Trump at 33% (loses) and 40% (favorite) is just enormous.
jbview	700098626740211713	2016-02-17T23:24:54	Probably won't happen now, but a Trump, Rubio, Kasich/Christie 3-way fight with Rubio as the conservative was very possible.
jbview	700098268626341893	2016-02-17T23:23:29	They may be just as easily pushed by cues about viability as are moderate/mainstream conservative voters.
jbview	700097861036466176	2016-02-17T23:21:51	There's also an anti-Trump very conservative vote which could easily be relatively indifferent between Cruz and Rubio.
jbview	700097600972832769	2016-02-17T23:20:49	The thing is I think we've all been focused on consolidating the Rubio/Jeb!/Kasich/Christie vote, and yes that's a thing and important. But:
jbview	700097333401423872	2016-02-17T23:19:46	One is: Yeah, it's an outlier, but that's some really well-timed good news for Cruz.

jbview	692425626503004160	2016-01-27T19:15:08	Fyodor32768 Sure, but there's always another primary in another week, and at some point they drop anyway.
jbview	692425412174090240	2016-01-27T19:14:17	ThePlumLineGS I mean, if Trump gets 60% in both, maybe he's the real frontrunner
jbview	692424850070200320	2016-01-27T19:12:03	ThePlumLineGS Too much for 140! Definitely below Jeb! would. But depends on lots of combinations.

jbview	692422396318453762	2016-01-27T19:02:18	baseballcrank Definitely a big weakness for him. Didn't really stop Romney (Kerry, Dukakis) though.
jbview	692421589267275777	2016-01-27T18:59:06	ThePlumLineGS Well, GOP voters in IA/NH could do it pretty easily.

jbview	692076567300837376	2016-01-26T20:08:06	yeselson It's worse than that. The dysfunction isn't about policy or ideology.
jbview	692075105258770433	2016-01-26T20:02:17	yeselson Yes, I basically agree with that.
jbview	692074937553702914	2016-01-26T20:01:37	yeselson Part of what makes parties democratic is they are permeable. Maybe Cruz faction is just majority now. Need evidence.

jbview	692073981336276992	2016-01-26T19:57:49	And it likely would also be a blow to party influence, and IMO therefore to democracy in US. (end)
jbview	692073679547678720	2016-01-26T19:56:37	Nominating Trump, a true party outsider who couldn't be trusted to be a partisan president, would be a major blow to the GOP as it's been.
jbview	692073187501305857	2016-01-26T19:54:40	And that's why a Trump nomination wouldn't just be devastating to some political science theory (which it would!)...
jbview	692072964737597440	2016-01-26T19:53:47	The core question is about party influence/control over governing institutions, especially the presidency. That's what's at stake here.
jbview	692072632980738048	2016-01-26T19:52:28	Predicting nominees isn't really what this is all about. It's interesting, and worthwhile, but it's not the core story.
jbview	692072236996517888	2016-01-26T19:50:54	But more important than that, and one thing NateSilver538 didn't get to in his fine piece yesterday...
jbview	692071792979111937	2016-01-26T19:49:08	What we're all interested in is nominations, not individual primaries or polls.
