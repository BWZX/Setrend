brycecovert	720787093883133954	2016-04-15T01:33:29	Agree or disagree with Clinton's position on raising the minimum wage, but there's nothing internally inconsistent about it.
brycecovert	720786877150703617	2016-04-15T01:32:37	We're barely three years removed from when $10.10 was the unattainable ask!
brycecovert	720787261349081090	2016-04-15T01:34:09	Let’s also recognize that it’s remarkable to have Dem candidates arguing over whether min wage should be $12 or $15 
brycecovert	720786773530554368	2016-04-15T01:32:13	That said, many economists back the idea of tiered minimum wage levels for different areas that have different costs of living.
brycecovert	720786362916544514	2016-04-15T01:30:35	The tiered implementation of New York’s $15 minimum wage was inserted as a concession to conservatives and big business.
brycecovert	720786129214156800	2016-04-15T01:29:39	Hillary just said she would sign a $15 federal minimum wage if Congress passed one. First I’ve heard her say that.

brycecovert	720240345288548353	2016-04-13T13:20:54	Everything said above about tech is true throughout the workforce. Women are at a disadvantage at the negotiating table, and they know it.
brycecovert	720240247347494912	2016-04-13T13:20:31	For another, they’re probably aware that women are penalized for aggressively asking for more money 
brycecovert	720240124735438848	2016-04-13T13:20:01	This isn’t about women failing to “set the right expectations.” For one, they probably have no idea what men are asking for and getting.
brycecovert	720240009232715776	2016-04-13T13:19:34	And here’s the thing about the idea that women in tech just aren’t asking for enough money when they get hired:
brycecovert	720239802742915073	2016-04-13T13:18:45	Tech companies offer women 3% less than men in starting salaries for the same jobs at the same companies

brycecovert	706665311869739008	2016-03-07T02:18:34	Welfare reform truly was and is a disaster 
brycecovert	706665203832856577	2016-03-07T02:18:08	Oh snap welfare reform in the Dem debate

brycecovert	706651307990454272	2016-03-07T01:22:55	lauraolin There was a Flint question in the last GOP debate. It got all of a minute of discussion.
brycecovert	706650530387501056	2016-03-07T01:19:50	It’s an important point: the water crisis is just one of many public health crises Flint has had to deal with 
brycecovert	706649948985630721	2016-03-07T01:17:31	Housing-based lead poisoning is still a huge problem. But it mostly impacts low-income people in old, decrepit buildings.
brycecovert	706649783558148096	2016-03-07T01:16:51	Sanders won’t promise to replace all of the country’s lead service pipes. Clinton says she will, and also get rid of it in other sources.
brycecovert	706649019116888064	2016-03-07T01:13:49	Glad Clinton is talking about the lead problems outside of Flint. It’s not just Flint.

brycecovert	706647993924067328	2016-03-07T01:09:45	Sanders is right: Flint residents paid the highest rates in the country while their water was poisoned
