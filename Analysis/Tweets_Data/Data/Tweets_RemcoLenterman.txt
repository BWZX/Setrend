RemcoLenterman	722154079800176644	2016-04-18T20:05:24	jmrose71 toadmeister actually think a Brexit would be particularly bad for NL. they share open economy ideals with UK (unlike FR,SP,IT)

RemcoLenterman	722152750461632516	2016-04-18T20:00:07	jmrose71 toadmeister I prefer UK to stay and change EU from within. There's a lot of support for that on continent. Look at NL referendum

RemcoLenterman	722144776854900738	2016-04-18T19:28:26	DanRoPo SixVpf point is the EU will make it as unattractive as possible for the UK to leave to stop others from considering it

RemcoLenterman	712606713984196608	2016-03-23T11:47:34	Herewegoagon SEC now believes speed bumps under 1ms are fine, so other exchanges are now free to adopt these too.
RemcoLenterman	712606399621165056	2016-03-23T11:46:19	Herewegoagon no, the exchanges pointed out that the speed bumps violated Reg NMS.  The SEC is now coming to a different view.

RemcoLenterman	712605689361928193	2016-03-23T11:43:30	Herewegoagon yes, as many have predicted, we will see several exchange filings with speed bump variants if IEX is approved.

RemcoLenterman	711216212357816320	2016-03-19T15:42:13	TodayTrader IEX They haven't denied the application at all, in fact they're leaning towards approving it.
RemcoLenterman	711215098774360064	2016-03-19T15:37:47	mechmarkets camerondovi yes, I'm very surprised it's ignored, perhaps because they realise it's indefensible to favour dark over lit
RemcoLenterman	711213872875769856	2016-03-19T15:32:55	camerondovi yes, it's asymmetric, the SEC makes no mention of it.
RemcoLenterman	711205558821507072	2016-03-19T14:59:53	ChicagoPhotoSho as did the FIA PTG 
RemcoLenterman	711205295486328832	2016-03-19T14:58:50	ChicagoPhotoSho HRT made some sensible suggestions on what should happen to SIP 
RemcoLenterman	711195844465311744	2016-03-19T14:21:17	ChicagoPhotoSho so I don't think IEX should be approved under current Reg NMS rules, I think Reg NMS needs to change
RemcoLenterman	711195656606584834	2016-03-19T14:20:32	ChicagoPhotoSho so if IEX is approved (and I think it will be) it will open the door to all kinds of speed bump variants. Very messy
RemcoLenterman	711195369288409088	2016-03-19T14:19:24	ChicagoPhotoSho so now the SEC has chosen a number between 350us and 5ms, which is 1ms.
RemcoLenterman	711195117923729408	2016-03-19T14:18:24	ChicagoPhotoSho several years ago PSX (Nasdaq) withdrew application for a 5ms delay because they'd lose protected status.
RemcoLenterman	711194335266643968	2016-03-19T14:15:17	ChicagoPhotoSho that's why they try to bend the interpretation of Reg NMS by saying below 1ms is de-minimis 
RemcoLenterman	711193800622919681	2016-03-19T14:13:10	ChicagoPhotoSho The SEC is in really tough spot. It's hard to justify approving IEX with current Reg NMS language. 
RemcoLenterman	711193158797955072	2016-03-19T14:10:37	ChicagoPhotoSho I'm more than happy to have a discussion with people but not in this way. In any case he started by blocking me

RemcoLenterman	711180131277082625	2016-03-19T13:18:51	8/end) Many trading firms have advocated for this. Here's an explanation 
RemcoLenterman	711179813260828672	2016-03-19T13:17:35	7) The most straightforward solution to markets' complexities is not introducing new ones. It's by removing cause of it: Rule 611
RemcoLenterman	711179518820663297	2016-03-19T13:16:25	6) Very similar to 2004: Many trading firms warned for complexity that rule 611 (quote protection) would bring, investors advocated for it
RemcoLenterman	711179269167325184	2016-03-19T13:15:25	5) It means that it will be impossible to deny exchange applications with asymmetric speedbumps under 1ms. It will become very messy
RemcoLenterman	711178915088375808	2016-03-19T13:14:01	4) SEC is tending to approve IEX by fixing the interpretation of Reg NMS. 'Programmed delay' wouldn't apply to less than 1ms
RemcoLenterman	711178335326478336	2016-03-19T13:11:42	3) The asymmetry in IEX's delay make it incomparable to delays of geographic nature.
RemcoLenterman	711177988176535553	2016-03-19T13:10:20	2) There is no mention in SEC document on the asymmetric nature of IEX's delay, fact that it does not apply to hidden, pegged orders
RemcoLenterman	711177709762813954	2016-03-19T13:09:13	1) SEC's preliminary view  on IEX's 350 us intentional delay is that it is de minimis. It opens a comment period into this interpretation
