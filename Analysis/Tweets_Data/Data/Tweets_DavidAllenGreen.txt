DavidAllenGreen	725958943357325312	2016-04-29T08:04:34	carlgardner I suspect after Tolstoy and McLibel, Strasbourg would eat a section 40(3) without an exception for breakfast.

DavidAllenGreen	725957369134350336	2016-04-29T07:58:19	carlgardner  In essence: without exceptions s40(3) will breach Article 10; and with exceptions, it is an expensive mess.  No way out.

DavidAllenGreen	725729393616801792	2016-04-28T16:52:25	stevenjbarnett Disagree. My post will set out why.
DavidAllenGreen	725728608036200448	2016-04-28T16:49:18	Justin_Gau HA HA!
DavidAllenGreen	725727186192338944	2016-04-28T16:43:39	This is "section 40":   See if you too can spot why it is illiberal and misconceived.  (Clue: subsection 40(3).)
DavidAllenGreen	725726857409249281	2016-04-28T16:42:20	The argument is simple - it would be irresponsible for Whittingdale to implement "section 40" at the moment, if at all.

DavidAllenGreen	725726524767371264	2016-04-28T16:41:01	And, in a sentence I am incredibly proud of, I will assert that Whittingdale's private life/tabloid stuff is not the reason it was delayed.
DavidAllenGreen	725726252204724224	2016-04-28T16:39:56	I will contend also that Hacked Off are wrong too urge its implementation without there being a recognised press body already in place.

DavidAllenGreen	725304432829804549	2016-04-27T12:43:46	damienhealy The inquest could not have gone so widely - that was down to Article 2 and the Middleton decision.
DavidAllenGreen	725303607206264832	2016-04-27T12:40:30	It was the Human Rights Act, and Article 2 of ECHR, which enabled the second Hillsborough Inquest to go far more widely than the first.

DavidAllenGreen	725075608120745984	2016-04-26T21:34:30	So we are left with the spectacle of a Home Secretary - a *Home Secretary* - going "rogue" over the limits to her legal powers.
DavidAllenGreen	725074913393053696	2016-04-26T21:31:45	It is one thing to have a Home Secretary who disagrees with human rights law. That is to be expected. But May does not understand it at all.
DavidAllenGreen	725074336604893185	2016-04-26T21:29:27	Or, in other words, we have a Home Secretary who genuinely has no notion of the legal limits to her powers.

DavidAllenGreen	724562180465692673	2016-04-25T11:34:20	Theresa May clearly dislikes human rights law because it stops her as Home Secretary doing exactly what she wants.  But that's its point.
DavidAllenGreen	724561688880680960	2016-04-25T11:32:22	Human rights law which allows Home Secretaries to do just as they want to do is not meaningfully "human rights" law at all.
DavidAllenGreen	724558511884144640	2016-04-25T11:19:45	May's demand re ECHR not worth getting upset or alarmed about. Good Friday agreement and devolution means it is not practical politics.

DavidAllenGreen	724557709664727040	2016-04-25T11:16:34	LindaFSemple I make that point in a following tweet.
DavidAllenGreen	724557531159400448	2016-04-25T11:15:51	English laws for English people say the supporters of Magna Carta, which was written in Latin.
DavidAllenGreen	724556839615078400	2016-04-25T11:13:06	Theresa May will let you have Magna Carta, which you cannot enforce in court, whilst removing ECHR provisions which you can.

DavidAllenGreen	724555774287077376	2016-04-25T11:08:52	Theresa May has now gone the full Magna Carta.
DavidAllenGreen	724553280630697984	2016-04-25T10:58:58	"Leave the ECHR"  The tabloids and the right-wingers nod.  (UK stays in ECHR.)  "Leave the ECHR"  And loop.   The politics of a dog-whistle.
DavidAllenGreen	724551571334377472	2016-04-25T10:52:10	The next layer of the ECHR onion.  Why calling for UK to leave ECHR is not practical politics. 
DavidAllenGreen	724550610008289281	2016-04-25T10:48:21	ruthie147 Absolutely. Fresh referendums.
DavidAllenGreen	724550463052455936	2016-04-25T10:47:46	"Theresa May calls for Good Friday agreement to be rewritten" is the real effect of her gesture-demand today.
DavidAllenGreen	724550147091345408	2016-04-25T10:46:31	Not least because rewriting the Good Friday agreement will need fresh referendums in Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
DavidAllenGreen	724549604893724672	2016-04-25T10:44:21	There are many other barriers to UK leaving ECHR, that is the most stark.  So this is simple gesture politics.
DavidAllenGreen	724549383321194496	2016-04-25T10:43:29	Unless Theresa May/UK government is willing to rewrite Good Friday agreement, UK will remain party to the ECHR.
DavidAllenGreen	724549143767687174	2016-04-25T10:42:32	Given that under Good Friday agreement, the ECHR has to have effect in Northern Ireland, Theresa May's call to leave ECHR will go nowhere.
DavidAllenGreen	724546142441222145	2016-04-25T10:30:36	Theresa May is dangling the European Convention like a bit of red meat to entice Euroskeptics away from Brexit

DavidAllenGreen	723811528743477248	2016-04-23T09:51:30	A word-switch, not a phrase-insertion: "back of the line" is an Obama rhetorical staple  By me, at JackofKent: 
DavidAllenGreen	723807958962962432	2016-04-23T09:37:19	lawrencecarter1 DavidRoseUK That is the point I am making.
DavidAllenGreen	723807759414775808	2016-04-23T09:36:32	DavidRoseUK I agree. But politicians (and others) do tend to use rhetorical staples. Hence my tweets.
DavidAllenGreen	723807521446735872	2016-04-23T09:35:35	Prof_DFrench Agree. Am a pure internationalist to the extent I have any views on nationalism.

DavidAllenGreen	723805868312154112	2016-04-23T09:29:01	jamesrbuk See my last few tweets on "back of the line" being an Obama rhetorical staple. So a simple word switch, not a phrase insertion.
DavidAllenGreen	723805714418937856	2016-04-23T09:28:24	IanDunt Looking at Obama's examples of "back of the line" suggests he likes the phrase. So a simple word switch, not a phrase insertion.

DavidAllenGreen	723804564709904384	2016-04-23T09:23:50	IanDunt See last few tweets. "Back of the line" is an Obama rhetorical staple. Nine public occasions in last three years.
DavidAllenGreen	723803290388041728	2016-04-23T09:18:46	For those mystified by those last tweets, they are addressing contention that "back of the queue" was inserted in Obama's speech by No 10.
DavidAllenGreen	723802782906617856	2016-04-23T09:16:45	All that happened is that one word was changed, for the British audience; but "back of the line" is an Obama rhetorical staple.
DavidAllenGreen	723802541012729856	2016-04-23T09:15:48	As Obama often uses "back of the line" in public, including when unscripted, then clear it his own phrase, not No 10's.
DavidAllenGreen	723802299559194624	2016-04-23T09:14:50	Four of those nine public occasions were press conferences rather than speeches, so "back of the line" is a phrase Obama readily uses.
DavidAllenGreen	723801602964987905	2016-04-23T09:12:04	Link for Obama using "back of the line" nine times since 2013: 
DavidAllenGreen	723801283560378368	2016-04-23T09:10:48	Obama appears to have used "back of the line" on nine public occasions since 2103. So even if "queue" word not his, rest of phrase will be.

DavidAllenGreen	723488897632636929	2016-04-22T12:29:29	BarristerSecret wmichallat I just thought that it was because the verb "to sentence" didn't have an 's'.
DavidAllenGreen	723486693559422976	2016-04-22T12:20:44	Matt_Hone Not a misuse. Just a signal - nothing good comes from an exchange which starts with someone affecting confusion or surprise.

DavidAllenGreen	723207831537725440	2016-04-21T17:52:38	Prince's innovative legal tactic was less successful than his innovations in music, and he remained contractually bound to Warner.
DavidAllenGreen	723207295887392768	2016-04-21T17:50:30	But Prince's greatest contribution to entertainment law was seeking to escape contractual obligations by changing his name to that scribble.

DavidAllenGreen	722037599142076416	2016-04-18T12:22:33	Injunction unlifted. 
DavidAllenGreen	722031864345726976	2016-04-18T11:59:45	Court of Appeal confirms that threesome injunction remains until 1300 Wednesday. Permission to appeal refused but publishers can ask UKSC.
DavidAllenGreen	722037423346184193	2016-04-18T12:21:51	frankiescar Yes: an expensive privacy dance.
DavidAllenGreen	722036042707136512	2016-04-18T12:16:22	frankiescar Bit more than that - costs in the privacy action.
DavidAllenGreen	722032424968916993	2016-04-18T12:01:59	frankiescar Yes: but the media are playing a dangerous game if they are seen to be stoking social media to frustrate an injunction.

DavidAllenGreen	722031516830842880	2016-04-18T11:58:22	From a legal perspective a decision on this celebrity injunction case by the Supreme Court would be welcome. Law is unclear re injunctions.
DavidAllenGreen	722030635976638464	2016-04-18T11:54:52	Correct reporting on injunction decision from pressgazette 
DavidAllenGreen	722029502642130944	2016-04-18T11:50:22	Jackson LJ: News Group Newspapers could still face claims for breach of confidence if they publish names (if and when injunction lifted).
DavidAllenGreen	722029995628064768	2016-04-18T11:52:20	There is a distinction between a decision of the Court and it being put into effect by the Court making an Order.
DavidAllenGreen	722029677192351745	2016-04-18T11:51:04	All the hurried news reports which say the celebrity injunction has been lifted are incorrect. It has not been (as yet); still in force.
DavidAllenGreen	722029427853496320	2016-04-18T11:50:04	So the celebrity injunction is still in place.  The Court of Appeal has said it should be lifted, but delayed it pending a further appeal.
DavidAllenGreen	722029138501111808	2016-04-18T11:48:55	So: injunction has *not* been lifted (contrary to news reports). There has been a decision to lift it, the actual lifting has been stayed.
DavidAllenGreen	722028364530348032	2016-04-18T11:45:51	Stay on reporting likely to continue until 1300 Wednesday — and longer if UKSupremeCourt agrees to hear appeal by publishers.
DavidAllenGreen	722027285998645248	2016-04-18T11:41:34	DavidAllenGreen Argument on stay is still continuing. Court of Appeal will no doubt rule in due course. In the meantime, injunction remains
DavidAllenGreen	722027128913600516	2016-04-18T11:40:56	Heresy_Corner Legally interesting how this is dealt with.
DavidAllenGreen	722026931806478336	2016-04-18T11:40:09	Looks like permission is being sought to appeal to the Supreme Court on the celebrity injunction case. Hence the stay.
DavidAllenGreen	722026603316932608	2016-04-18T11:38:51	This is getting complicated, even for lawyers.

DavidAllenGreen	720333920399589378	2016-04-13T19:32:44	"Legal tender" in England does not mean what many think it means. See 
DavidAllenGreen	720333388377366528	2016-04-13T19:30:37	Prof_DFrench carlgardner "Legal tender" has a very specific legal meaning in England: 
DavidAllenGreen	720332373636882432	2016-04-13T19:26:35	Prof_DFrench carlgardner No - it is a convention.  Ditto notes from Channel Islands and Man.

DavidAllenGreen	720170953989296128	2016-04-13T08:45:10	No word from Hacked Off on the privacy of sex worker caught up in this news story.   
DavidAllenGreen	720170391822581760	2016-04-13T08:42:56	Erica_Jane_MP Sorry for the RT - I hope the response not too overwhelming!
DavidAllenGreen	720165210921832448	2016-04-13T08:22:20	So... people AREN'T allowed a private life, now? That's much clearer now, thanks, Hacked Off.
DavidAllenGreen	720163396952399873	2016-04-13T08:15:08	'Leaving (x) open to blackmail' is always a bullshit excuse for publishing the very story a supposed blackmailer would threaten to publish.
DavidAllenGreen	720160943846604800	2016-04-13T08:05:23	Hacked Off finally became what they said they opposed. Intrusions in to private lives of those caught up in news, ends justifying means.

DavidAllenGreen	720137695469637632	2016-04-13T06:33:00	"Let's throw the privacy of the sex worker under the bus, for we have an important political point to make."
DavidAllenGreen	720137384755654656	2016-04-13T06:31:46	AbiWilks It is stark how it is taken for granted her privacy does not matter in all of this. The political point is somehow more important.
DavidAllenGreen	720136606833844224	2016-04-13T06:28:41	It is not privacy of Whittingdale but of the sex worker being trampled on in this story. Hacked Off used to be against that sort of thing.
DavidAllenGreen	720134265711771648	2016-04-13T06:19:23	And I say that as one of the few people who ever exposed a national newspaper for hacking (in Nightjack.) Am not kneejerk anti-Leveson.
DavidAllenGreen	720133656845676544	2016-04-13T06:16:57	"We don't care about privacy of sex worker caught up in story, the political point we want to make is far too important" is misconceived.
DavidAllenGreen	720132787144171520	2016-04-13T06:13:30	The "pro Leveson" campaigners pushing this story should take a good hard look at what they are actually doing with story.
DavidAllenGreen	720132338672406528	2016-04-13T06:11:43	I thought Leveson and media law reform was about protecting the privacy of people caught up in news stories. It would appear not.
DavidAllenGreen	720131951152209924	2016-04-13T06:10:11	Ghastly that privacy of sex worker caught up in this case seems to be of no consequence; a "price worth paying" to make a political point.
DavidAllenGreen	720126181971009536	2016-04-13T05:47:15	This seems to be the sort of intrusive story on a flimsy pretext which one would think media and privacy law reformers would be against.
DavidAllenGreen	720125568566632450	2016-04-13T05:44:49	Privacy must be breached by the media so as to ensure the media do not breach privacy?   This Whittingdale stuff doesn't make much sense.

DavidAllenGreen	719918628578205696	2016-04-12T16:02:31	PaulbernalUK I remember CasparBowden warning me the government would try to do this with other legal powers.
DavidAllenGreen	719918388554948608	2016-04-12T16:01:33	The barrister for LauriLove is certainly giving the NCA_UK some welly at this hearing. 
DavidAllenGreen	719917583051395076	2016-04-12T15:58:21	PaulbernalUK The ghost of CasparBowden is at my elbow.
DavidAllenGreen	719916444465688576	2016-04-12T15:53:50	There is *no* point having legal safeguards for privacy, if the NCA_UK just try to use other legal powers instead.    LauriLove
DavidAllenGreen	719915926750175233	2016-04-12T15:51:46	Follow richietynan for live tweets from the laurielove hearing. 
DavidAllenGreen	719915729219371008	2016-04-12T15:50:59	See my TL for why this matters. In essence, NCA_UK are trying to get round using the RIPA scheme (which has safeguards). LauriLove
DavidAllenGreen	719915444765868034	2016-04-12T15:49:52	Issue in LauriLove hearing today is whether NCA_UK can use "directions" in a civil case to get an encryption key, instead of RIPA scheme.
DavidAllenGreen	719912712256516096	2016-04-12T15:39:00	ShipBrief Not in this case, but you are right generally.
DavidAllenGreen	719911877216702465	2016-04-12T15:35:41	Hilarious. NCA_UK just argued that encryption software "kicked in" when a machine switched off. LauriLove
DavidAllenGreen	719911739702263808	2016-04-12T15:35:08	Woo-hoo - and why did they not say that to begin with?  LauriLove 
DavidAllenGreen	719908018335432704	2016-04-12T15:20:21	The judge appeared to be caught off guard by the number of members of the public that showed up for the hearing. LauriLove

DavidAllenGreen	719896563888365568	2016-04-12T14:34:50	Judgment will be reserved in LauriLove today, whatever happens in hearing. 
DavidAllenGreen	719895904896098306	2016-04-12T14:32:13	There can be no good reason for non-disclosure of NCA_UK's legal arguments in LauriLove (with any secret evidence redacted if necessary).
DavidAllenGreen	719895474237517825	2016-04-12T14:30:30	In essence: NCA_UK want to bypass RIPA so as to access an encryption key, but we are *not* to know their legal arguments.  LauriLove
DavidAllenGreen	719894847444881409	2016-04-12T14:28:01	Serious point: if NCA_UK legal arguments (not evidence) cannot be disclosed to press/public then very worrying.   LauriLove
DavidAllenGreen	719893499273965568	2016-04-12T14:22:39	One can understand why NCA_UK may want to restrict publication of evidence; but not the underlying law on which they seek to rely.
DavidAllenGreen	719893106347413504	2016-04-12T14:21:06	This is *not* about (secret) evidence - it is about the legal arguments the NCA_UK want to rely on. Clear public interest.  LauriLove
DavidAllenGreen	719892871424393216	2016-04-12T14:20:10	A "skeleton argument" sets out the legal arguments on which a party relies. The NCA_UK want to deny press access to its legal arguments.
DavidAllenGreen	719892629933137920	2016-04-12T14:19:12	Not as glamorous as a celebrity injunction but this restriction is serious affront to press freedom.  LauriLove

DavidAllenGreen	718105386721607680	2016-04-07T15:57:20	A "superinjunction" is one where existence of injunction itself was not to be disclosed; not same as injunction which has been anonymised.
DavidAllenGreen	718105072924823553	2016-04-07T15:56:05	In essence: if you have read about  the injunction in the news then it is not a "superinjunction".

DavidAllenGreen	717971786911059968	2016-04-07T07:06:27	Similar to the old urban myth that putting "allegedly" in front of a statement makes it magically libel-safe. Nope.
DavidAllenGreen	717971400980631552	2016-04-07T07:04:55	Court says it does not matter if you add "I believe" in front of allegation - still allegation of fact not opinion.

DavidAllenGreen	717775843305631744	2016-04-06T18:07:51	mjrharris StigAbell And nasty stuff which destroys people lives - re privacy and defamation - should be left to the general law of land.
DavidAllenGreen	717775049831407617	2016-04-06T18:04:42	mjrharris StigAbell I think each title should now take its own complaints process seriously, as with US titles.  IPSO as outdated as PCC.
DavidAllenGreen	717774398837628928	2016-04-06T18:02:06	mjrharris Newspapers should take pride in their own complaints processes, as in America.  No point any more hiding behind "self regulation"
DavidAllenGreen	717774124656017408	2016-04-06T18:01:01	mjrharris Self-regulation is no regulation. A figleaf. Each title/publisher should deal with complaints itself, like FT and Guardian do,
DavidAllenGreen	717773385149890561	2016-04-06T17:58:05	mjrharris Overall: IPSO and so on are regulating the Fleet Street of 20 years ago. Sector specific regulation is a nonsense now in my view.
DavidAllenGreen	717773030919897088	2016-04-06T17:56:40	mjrharris I disagree. It is a horrid distortion of the relevant law, but it can be navigated with care by a sensible editor or journalist.
DavidAllenGreen	717772458271576064	2016-04-06T17:54:24	mjrharris Any competent media lawyer would be able to pilot the Panama Papers to publication. S. 40 is very wrong but not for that reason.
DavidAllenGreen	717772017509015552	2016-04-06T17:52:39	mjrharris I disagree with you on s. 40.  The provision is wrong - very wrong - in principle, but it would not have the effect you suggest.
DavidAllenGreen	717771542239776768	2016-04-06T17:50:45	mjrharris Journalism at the FT is in fine form, and it is not under any regulator.  Strange that. ;-)
DavidAllenGreen	717768367785029632	2016-04-06T17:38:09	GrahamRat No inherent reason that could not be done on a contractual basis?
DavidAllenGreen	717767489531297792	2016-04-06T17:34:39	nmassarano That is simply because you then join a law firm.  The LPC is incidental.

DavidAllenGreen	717765379817345024	2016-04-06T17:26:16	nmassarano The only people who like equity are rich people's lawyers, smug law students, and Denning groupies.

DavidAllenGreen	717763970074079232	2016-04-06T17:20:40	So: if we outlaw Trusts and Equity, only the outlaws will have trusts and equity.  Like prohibition, all over again.

DavidAllenGreen	716908984473620480	2016-04-04T08:43:16	Great informative piece by legalhackette.  
DavidAllenGreen	716902902439223296	2016-04-04T08:19:06	Worry is that Gove now thinks he has "solved" the problem of MoJGovUK crap policy-making.  It is still there - lurking, waiting.
DavidAllenGreen	716901207520972801	2016-04-04T08:12:21	Unless Gove is careful and gives MoJGovUK full attention, MoJ will revert to its natural state of crap policy-making and implementation.
DavidAllenGreen	716900846416564224	2016-04-04T08:10:55	1. MoJGovUK launches policy 2. Onlookers point to it not being thought-through 3. Policy doesn't work 4. MoJ reverses policy  And loop.
DavidAllenGreen	716899821664256000	2016-04-04T08:06:51	Whilst Gove becomes preoccupied with Brexit, the mess which is MoJGovUK is still there. Without a careful eye, bad policy will return.
DavidAllenGreen	716899523142942720	2016-04-04T08:05:40	aljwhite That was not a policy as such - all the recent policy reversal decisions are welcome.
DavidAllenGreen	716899201255346176	2016-04-04T08:04:23	Difficult to remember the last MoJGovUK policy which was properly thought-through.
DavidAllenGreen	716898831418392576	2016-04-04T08:02:55	And note BTL comment that MoJ projected income of £100m pa from this. A truly Grayling policy. No other word for it.

DavidAllenGreen	715590398593384448	2016-03-31T17:23:40	Not really piersmorgan's fault - most people would be surprised to learn what "assault" and "battery" mean in English and American law.
DavidAllenGreen	715589522382307329	2016-03-31T17:20:11	zahidf Depends on the facts - see the CPS guidance I linked to.
DavidAllenGreen	715588913121898499	2016-03-31T17:17:46	This is not to prejudge whether offence was committed in this case, but US media accurate in describing the charge, and not piersmorgan.
DavidAllenGreen	715588173905149953	2016-03-31T17:14:50	Why the distinction is important. 
DavidAllenGreen	715588018791452672	2016-03-31T17:14:13	Here you are: Florida law follows English law.  The US media are legally correct, and piersmorgan is incorrect.

DavidAllenGreen	715586068280528896	2016-03-31T17:06:28	Of course, a "charge of battery" now has more than one meaning.

DavidAllenGreen	715585059072380928	2016-03-31T17:02:27	The American position would be similar, as the terms date from English common law before American independence.
DavidAllenGreen	715584842503684096	2016-03-31T17:01:36	For piersmorgan and others, legal distinction between Assault and Battery, from cpsuk:  
DavidAllenGreen	715583811359285248	2016-03-31T16:57:30	In essence, yes. Assault is merely threat of attack.  At law, "battery" is what most people describe as "assault".

DavidAllenGreen	715581679411269633	2016-03-31T16:49:01	"Assault" and "Battery" do not, at law, mean what people often mean by those words. The alleged offence in that case would be battery.
DavidAllenGreen	715581210446139392	2016-03-31T16:47:10	Confuses new law students too, but at law the allegation (if proved) would be one of battery.

DavidAllenGreen	712615248478515201	2016-03-23T12:21:29	marcuswstow I accept that.  I can only apologise and seek to do better.
DavidAllenGreen	712614163768586240	2016-03-23T12:17:11	HamHambreen You are right. But I made a mistake, and I should have challenged him instead.
DavidAllenGreen	712613996722053121	2016-03-23T12:16:31	asymbina It was obviously wrong, and I apologise for sending it.
DavidAllenGreen	712613862093275136	2016-03-23T12:15:59	GlenHart7 HamHambreen Noted, and i am sorry.
DavidAllenGreen	712613815557484544	2016-03-23T12:15:48	marcuswstow Good point, and I am sorry.
DavidAllenGreen	712613731973337093	2016-03-23T12:15:28	nanayasleeps I am sorry if I got that wrong.
DavidAllenGreen	712613573097340928	2016-03-23T12:14:50	msjenniferjames That is a good point.
DavidAllenGreen	712613511222992896	2016-03-23T12:14:35	HamHambreen That is a strong point, and I will reconsider things accordingly.  As I said, I am sorry for my mistake.
DavidAllenGreen	712613249104158720	2016-03-23T12:13:32	msjenniferjames I am sorry for that impression; I am not intending to snipe at you.

DavidAllenGreen	712612730436460544	2016-03-23T12:11:29	msjenniferjames I am happy to take criticism.  I made a mistake and said so to all my followers, with an apology.
DavidAllenGreen	712612471119462400	2016-03-23T12:10:27	HamHambreen Yes: I think his tweets contain true and false statements. I think it was written for effect.
DavidAllenGreen	712612150922121216	2016-03-23T12:09:11	nanayasleeps I am sorry we differ.  But it looked like you were seeking to launch a pile-on.
DavidAllenGreen	712611535437357056	2016-03-23T12:06:44	HamHambreen I would not say such a thing in jest; I still think the exchange is fictional.
DavidAllenGreen	712611040035487744	2016-03-23T12:04:46	msjenniferjames Indeed.  it means I am doing things the right way.  I would be (genuinely) unhappy if I was not correcting such things.
DavidAllenGreen	712610722384056322	2016-03-23T12:03:30	nanayasleeps And you still used my tweet in that way. Ok,

DavidAllenGreen	712610271513223168	2016-03-23T12:01:43	msjenniferjames Happy to say I am wrong when I am wrong. Should be encouraged.

DavidAllenGreen	712609447621865473	2016-03-23T11:58:26	msjenniferjames Well done on sending a tweet without checking my follow-on tweet first.

DavidAllenGreen	712607249626177536	2016-03-23T11:49:42	piersb The "meely mouthed" pay-off line was so absurd, it makes me think it was - but I can see the force in your view.
DavidAllenGreen	712606181995454466	2016-03-23T11:45:28	alanknox richardpolhill That must have seemed very clever before you typed it out ;-)
DavidAllenGreen	712606041188528128	2016-03-23T11:44:54	piersb Seemed too well-crafted a tweet for it to be true. Sent for effect.
DavidAllenGreen	712604558397202432	2016-03-23T11:39:00	piersb If false, what purpose did it serve?
DavidAllenGreen	712603829766922240	2016-03-23T11:36:07	SteveDavies01 And there we are; we disagree.  And I am sorry for that.
DavidAllenGreen	712602858630352896	2016-03-23T11:32:15	SteveDavies01 And for the record: I support complete freedom of movement, and unrestricted migration, as a matter of principle.
DavidAllenGreen	712602660273307648	2016-03-23T11:31:28	SteveDavies01 I did not accept an excuse; I formed my own view...
DavidAllenGreen	712602250812788737	2016-03-23T11:29:50	SteveDavies01 So: whether an exchange actually happened is irrelevant to me saying it actually did not happen?  Got you.
DavidAllenGreen	712601964757037056	2016-03-23T11:28:42	helstweets So we agree it was a fictional exchange?
DavidAllenGreen	712601767142363136	2016-03-23T11:27:55	helstweets Fair enough. Do you believe the exchange actually happened?
DavidAllenGreen	712601652818276352	2016-03-23T11:27:28	piersb You should have checked my TL too, before tweeting - have explained my view.

DavidAllenGreen	712593214247673856	2016-03-23T10:53:56	JJohnotha Quite. The tweet was not an accurate statement. But sent for effect.
DavidAllenGreen	712593032034590720	2016-03-23T10:53:12	Otto_English badhedgehog iainaitch A second tweet with the same riff is not proof?

DavidAllenGreen	712590911922966528	2016-03-23T10:44:47	Graeme_Coyle Too perfectly crafted, almost designed to get the effect it did. Incidentail detail 'Croydon' and provocative pay off line.

DavidAllenGreen	712571646087983108	2016-03-23T09:28:14	DavidAllenGreen that's because as we all know: people can't be trusted until they become politicians or police.
DavidAllenGreen	712571550227103745	2016-03-23T09:27:51	And this is on the pretext of protecting our way of life from being undermined.
DavidAllenGreen	712571157476716544	2016-03-23T09:26:17	The policy of the UK state is to have as much secrecy over its own affairs whilst giving civilians as little privacy over their own affairs.
DavidAllenGreen	712569617483489280	2016-03-23T09:20:10	But surely the police have nothing to worry about if they have nothing to hide?
DavidAllenGreen	712568102018527232	2016-03-23T09:14:09	The police seek Secret Courts for their officers whilst pressing for more surveillance powers against civilians.
DavidAllenGreen	712560887282987009	2016-03-23T08:45:28	I am afraid you are right.  
DavidAllenGreen	712558006236540928	2016-03-23T08:34:02	The shameless police submission to Pitchford can only be understood in the context of a trend for closed justice, enabled by the Lib Dems.

DavidAllenGreen	712302457787969536	2016-03-22T15:38:34	Surely best way of showing merits of Western liberal values is by asserting them when under attack, not by undermining or compromising them.
DavidAllenGreen	712302004752801792	2016-03-22T15:36:46	If the West uses torture, curbs fair trial rights, ignores privacy rights, and restricts free expression: only then will our values be safe.
DavidAllenGreen	712300850106994689	2016-03-22T15:32:11	In order to save Western liberal values it became necessary to discard them.

DavidAllenGreen	712294948507226112	2016-03-22T15:08:44	david_colquhoun It is not available yet as far as I know; I think you can't link your analysis to that case on basis of mere news reports.

DavidAllenGreen	712294146179002369	2016-03-22T15:05:32	david_colquhoun Cheers. At first glance, I would warn against relying on news reports on why Squier struck off. Have you seen GMC ruling?
DavidAllenGreen	712292639979266051	2016-03-22T14:59:33	No doubt St Lucia would just as easily appoint Boaty McBoatface as its representative to the international Maritime Organisation.

DavidAllenGreen	711104119709286400	2016-03-19T08:16:48	shiv5468 Given you are unwilling to put your own name to your tweets, I am sure the letters you do put your name to are very good indeed.

DavidAllenGreen	711080843192766464	2016-03-19T06:44:18	hugorifkind See post at  for my critique of such wording in letters.
DavidAllenGreen	711080181608353792	2016-03-19T06:41:41	hugorifkind It is often the intention to imply it is your opponent's fault. A form of passive aggression.
DavidAllenGreen	711079726228574210	2016-03-19T06:39:52	hugorifkind Perhaps! Just my response, based on dealing with letters almost every day with people affecting to be 'surprised' etc.
DavidAllenGreen	711077721816887296	2016-03-19T06:31:54	You may well be 'disappointed' by what your opponent does, but you are never ever 'puzzled' (or 'surprised').
DavidAllenGreen	711077129841221632	2016-03-19T06:29:33	In essence, if you say you are 'puzzled' by what your opponent does, you are admitting to have lost control of the situation.
DavidAllenGreen	711076784855490560	2016-03-19T06:28:11	Cameron's 'puzzled' line similar to lawyers' discrediting use of 'astonished and suprised' in litigation letters:

DavidAllenGreen	710854241477332992	2016-03-18T15:43:52	nickg101 jeremyduns MoAnsar Which would mean, beautifully, he perjured himself in the Tribunal case.

DavidAllenGreen	710806872085938176	2016-03-18T12:35:39	jojowiththeflow jeremyduns No, he is pretending nothing has been posted.  And there is a lot more in those Lloyds case reports of note.
DavidAllenGreen	710806482527371265	2016-03-18T12:34:06	holland_tom Glad to be of service.  There is nothing in that post which he can dispute.
DavidAllenGreen	710799531890319360	2016-03-18T12:06:29	jeremyduns Especially as it has now had over 3k hits and has been widely RTd and linked to.
DavidAllenGreen	710799325664772098	2016-03-18T12:05:39	jeremyduns So my post saying, as a fact, moansar is a self-admitted liar has been up 48 hours. And not a threat. Isn't that interesting.

DavidAllenGreen	705184740555563008	2016-03-03T00:15:18	DavidAllenGreen so I can see a gap where the statutory tort might be needed. Why abolish it?
DavidAllenGreen	705184472430481408	2016-03-03T00:14:14	DavidAllenGreen ultimately it wasn't needed in ph cases as privacy took over but at start before disclosure breach of stat duty was needed

DavidAllenGreen	705130656918073346	2016-03-02T20:40:23	Odysseus_Trust But the torts do not fit completely. Interference with a system not equal to misuse of private information?

DavidAllenGreen	705115711639834625	2016-03-02T19:41:00	simonmckay No doubt! But this is one I am going to follow up on. No point having any legal regime which is impossible to enforce directly.
DavidAllenGreen	705114596877705216	2016-03-02T19:36:34	simonmckay Maybe! But an explanation may be useful. And the statutory tort and the tort of misuse of private information not quite the same

DavidAllenGreen	701161123685474304	2016-02-20T21:46:53	David Cameron has no more a sincere interest in parliamentary sovereignty than he has in Aston Villa.

DavidAllenGreen	701106856702435328	2016-02-20T18:11:15	If this “sovereignty bill” is sold as bigging up British judges, beware: the Tories may actually be giving Parliamentary sovereignty away.
DavidAllenGreen	701122534910074880	2016-02-20T19:13:33	carlgardner Ha, not at all. Was shopping. For Villa, as with Napoleon, it all started going wrong in Moscow.
DavidAllenGreen	701106977347387392	2016-02-20T18:11:43	carlgardner Exactly: Cameron has as much a sincere interest in parliamentary sovereignty as he does in Aston Villa.
DavidAllenGreen	701105928528121856	2016-02-20T18:07:33	carlgardner I think it is both sad and hilarious. It is like someone pretending to like a sport they know nothing about.

DavidAllenGreen	701062653595230208	2016-02-20T15:15:36	Even our notion of a constitutional monarchy owes to us having a Dutch King, a Hanoverian King, and a Prince Consort from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.

DavidAllenGreen	700731844116029440	2016-02-19T17:21:05	Have a great weekend, and thank you for following.
DavidAllenGreen	700723212380798978	2016-02-19T16:46:47	This is almost taking as long as the Labour reshuffle.

DavidAllenGreen	700387202610683904	2016-02-18T18:31:36	We should dare Letwin to declare parliament is sovereign by an Order in Council.

DavidAllenGreen	700382049186795520	2016-02-18T18:11:07	Perhaps he’ll repeat his Leveson trick, and propose a Royal Sovereignty Charter. 
DavidAllenGreen	700381350247985153	2016-02-18T18:08:21	Poor Letwin, probably had no idea of the legal and constitutional impossibilities in the task of promoting a "Sovereignty Bill".
DavidAllenGreen	700380793961652225	2016-02-18T18:06:08	"Oh, Oliver, you simply must take forward this wonderful opportunity of pushing forward the Sovereignty Bill. I really envy you."

DavidAllenGreen	700379927682674692	2016-02-18T18:02:41	This is my reading of the situation. 
DavidAllenGreen	700379394423001088	2016-02-18T18:00:34	There are reasons why wise people have not attempted to place "sovereignty" in a statute.    Letwin is about to discover these reasons.

DavidAllenGreen	700378072642621443	2016-02-18T17:55:19	One can only wonder how Letwin and the Cabinet Office have been left with sorting out the mess of a Sovereignty Bill, and not Gove and MoJ.
DavidAllenGreen	700377509003710464	2016-02-18T17:53:05	DanHannanMEP I can only imagine the pain you must be feeling ;-) 
DavidAllenGreen	700376654590447618	2016-02-18T17:49:41	Just wait until Letwin discovers that "sovereignty of parliament" is an English law doctrine, with no Scottish counterpart.  And then watch.
DavidAllenGreen	700376293246898179	2016-02-18T17:48:15	DavidAllenGreen be fair.  At the top of the page are the words "British bill of rights" crossed out.
DavidAllenGreen	700376146802839553	2016-02-18T17:47:40	In a room in the Cabinet Office, Oliver Letwin sits with a sheet of paper entitled "Sovereignty Bill".  The page is otherwise blank.
DavidAllenGreen	700375798608486401	2016-02-18T17:46:17	Whether the UK has a "Sovereignty Act" or not will come down to whether Boris agrees to campaign against Brexit.  All too daft for words.
DavidAllenGreen	700375312526397441	2016-02-18T17:44:21	And if Letwin is to promote a "Sovereignty" Bill, then Cabinet Office will need more resources than it has now. Bills take time and money.
DavidAllenGreen	700374502694326276	2016-02-18T17:41:08	The Tory party of Peel, Tamworth Manifesto, Disraeli, Salisbury, Hailsham, Mackay: reduced to constitutional drivel over a "Sovereignty Act"
DavidAllenGreen	700374235055841281	2016-02-18T17:40:04	Letwin does not have a clue; Cameron doesn't care; Boris is thinking of other things.  And they decide whether we get a "Sovereignty Bill".
DavidAllenGreen	700373674277367808	2016-02-18T17:37:50	So, it looks like whether we get a "Bill of Rights" and a "Sovereignty Act" comes down to buying Boris's support over Brexit.  Shambolic.

DavidAllenGreen	699874057647431680	2016-02-17T08:32:33	Today the PM will laud the 'sovereignty of parliament' whilst in practice he encourages ministers to bypass it with secondary legislation.
DavidAllenGreen	699873158120210432	2016-02-17T08:28:58	AdamWagner1 Two types of legal commentator... 
DavidAllenGreen	699869812537880576	2016-02-17T08:15:40	"Here are the Bill of Rights propsals."  "This sheet is almost blank, Michael."  "Yes, Prime Minister, it is a consultation document."
DavidAllenGreen	699868875534548992	2016-02-17T08:11:57	Today the Prime Minister is to announce a parliamentary Bill to make parliament sovereign, to be known as the Circular Logic Act.
DavidAllenGreen	699868292308189184	2016-02-17T08:09:38	On the walk over from MoJ to Downing Street, someone scribbles desperately on a still rather blank sheet of paper.

DavidAllenGreen	699520841218920448	2016-02-16T09:08:59	One of the saddest features of modern political discourse is that 'it should be banned' is too often a near-synonym for 'I disagree'.
DavidAllenGreen	699520004815982592	2016-02-16T09:05:40	JamesWorron EmmaKennedy Bit unfair to take it out of context! Should be banned. Oh.
DavidAllenGreen	699519829099880449	2016-02-16T09:04:58	One day, the first impulse when faced with something one disagrees with will not be to 'ban' it.   Bans should be exceptions, not the rule.

DavidAllenGreen	699516093837221888	2016-02-16T08:50:07	The strange thing is, by reason of the Internet, (non-)invitations onto campus are now just symbolic. No-platforming has been no-platformed.
