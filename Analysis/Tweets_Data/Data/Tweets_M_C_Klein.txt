M_C_Klein	715928484049248256	2016-04-01T15:47:06	IvanTheK flat to rising unemployment rate makes you think there's a shortage of labor?
M_C_Klein	715927296289415168	2016-04-01T15:42:23	teasri of course, that's the point we both made, just most people don't understand it that way, could lead to different policies
M_C_Klein	715926548965113856	2016-04-01T15:39:25	NickatFP that's fair
M_C_Klein	715926377392943105	2016-04-01T15:38:44	Martin Wolf says we need to think of government as a financial service provider:   I agree:

M_C_Klein	715661129540890625	2016-03-31T22:04:44	matt_levine issue you've highlighted, if I understand it, is not getting rid of requirement, but finding other crimes to justify punishment
M_C_Klein	715660532951474180	2016-03-31T22:02:22	matt_levine which leaves you with unappetizing choice of: do nothing, or get creative
M_C_Klein	715660448641761284	2016-03-31T22:02:01	matt_levine sure, but in practice problem was inability to get sufficient evidence to charge him with murder bc of witness intimidation etc

M_C_Klein	715588266435723264	2016-03-31T17:15:12	tomashirstecon I mean, again, look at the banks. GVA could easily be negative once you properly measure risk and state subsidies
M_C_Klein	715586846970015744	2016-03-31T17:09:33	tomashirstecon I think argument is basically: bad things would've happened if banks failed, so saved them, why behavior different w steel?
M_C_Klein	715586465007321089	2016-03-31T17:08:02	RajaKorman tomashirstecon well also he thinks the jobs are good, believes in complementarities and industrial clustering

M_C_Klein	715585623659266048	2016-03-31T17:04:42	tomashirstecon presumably if you live in the part of the UK with the steel plants it would be pretty disruptive...
M_C_Klein	715583928065789954	2016-03-31T16:57:58	tomashirstecon or, rather, perceived as essential
M_C_Klein	715583864383602688	2016-03-31T16:57:42	tomashirstecon "strategic" in the sense of being essential to independent modern country

M_C_Klein	715570143145934848	2016-03-31T16:03:11	PaulJDavies sure, but the particular argument I quoted made a reasonable amount of sense, esp if you think steel has strategic value

M_C_Klein	694199034295136257	2016-02-01T16:42:02	ritwik_priya Zettel314 if you look at why most people rent vs own, it's because they don't have enough liquid assets to afford deposit
M_C_Klein	694198919891259393	2016-02-01T16:41:34	Zettel314 renters avoid sacrificing liquidity but pay higher price than debt servicing costs
M_C_Klein	694198715272179713	2016-02-01T16:40:45	Zettel314 the illiquidity comes from both the deposit requirement and from the general difficulty of selling houses on short notice
M_C_Klein	694198599207358464	2016-02-01T16:40:18	Zettel314 right, illiquid assets should trade at a discount, which would look like an uncapitalized benefit for owners

M_C_Klein	694196438306152448	2016-02-01T16:31:43	Zettel314 or alternatively the cost is liquidity, which shows up both in the form of deposit constraint and the difficulty of moving
M_C_Klein	694195314576613377	2016-02-01T16:27:15	Zettel314 if deposit constraint disappeared then presumably prices and debt service costs would rise

M_C_Klein	690915813881155585	2016-01-23T15:15:41	IronEconomist Gilesyb 2) they had lots of other tools to boost domestic demand besides fx but didn't use them
M_C_Klein	690915666497503232	2016-01-23T15:15:06	IronEconomist Gilesyb 1) they never said weak domestic demand was the problem, they said their currency was being overvalued

M_C_Klein	690899787600773121	2016-01-23T14:12:00	Gilesyb IronEconomist to be clear the original point wasn't that the SNB should be pushing up the franc but that it shouldn't push up EUR

M_C_Klein	690618127252639744	2016-01-22T19:32:47	Gilesyb put another way, ending fx intervention only equivalent to tightening domestic monetary policy if it's also loosening policy abroad
M_C_Klein	690617442750578688	2016-01-22T19:30:04	Gilesyb it does nothing for global growth either way, just moves the weakness outside Switzerland
