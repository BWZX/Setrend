jasonkincaid	725484548495015938	2016-04-28T00:39:29	Great story. 
jasonkincaid	722227352550318080	2016-04-19T00:56:33	danielraffel I've enjoyed watching his rise from afar. There are videos on youtube of his opponents taunting me(him). Good motivation!
jasonkincaid	721132670088904704	2016-04-16T00:26:41	Hey tech bloggers: Trump is not the only story here. /sigh 
jasonkincaid	721087810082463744	2016-04-15T21:28:25	blupixelz caffeinatedvee EatThisMuch you too! A fun panel!
jasonkincaid	712312087796699136	2016-03-22T16:16:50	nathanjurgenson but as you said, it's pervasive. And games don't only induce angst (can be exciting etc)
jasonkincaid	712311813359198209	2016-03-22T16:15:45	nathanjurgenson I agree, and snapchat feels more genuine. But still wary of games inducing social angst (esp in teens) to boost engagement
jasonkincaid	712307420958224384	2016-03-22T15:58:17	nathanjurgenson what about snapchat's (retired) scoreboard and the 'best friend' emojis? No game there?
jasonkincaid	710707466867048448	2016-03-18T06:00:39	CaseyNewton yep, but takes two to tango. you may enjoy/hate my book about this:

jasonkincaid	667006859098853377	2015-11-18T15:50:02	vijaypande a16z would love to hear more about ethics. What framework will you use when considering thorny issues?
jasonkincaid	664862165975834624	2015-11-12T17:47:47	jrlevine ElectricObjects awesome! üçª
jasonkincaid	664861838601916416	2015-11-12T17:46:29	jrlevine ElectricObjects sounds great. Will it have ads eventually? (hope not)
jasonkincaid	658860217220755457	2015-10-27T04:18:11	Kantrowitz it is, but takeaway is: M is magic. FB is getting big PR fuzzies. Make 'em earn them.
jasonkincaid	658856626368086016	2015-10-27T04:03:55	Kantrowitz wish you would be more skeptical without any info on what here is AI and what is human, how they plan to scale, timeframe...

jasonkincaid	657410638826745856	2015-10-23T04:18:05	RonenV try OneNote or Google Drive. Both do OCR on images (latter prob easier for a folder full)
jasonkincaid	657330145577971712	2015-10-22T22:58:13	carlzimmer Very cool, looking forward to more!
jasonkincaid	657244304029552640	2015-10-22T17:17:07	TechCrunch JoshConstine This should discuss potential for abuse. Also compounds issues for people who don't grok privacy settings.
jasonkincaid	657240558868369408	2015-10-22T17:02:14	carlzimmer fascinating. Q: why not routinely test/add old microbial dna to database? Probably more surprises/trends to find. Cost issue?
jasonkincaid	655048552549191681	2015-10-16T15:51:59	shinguardian joshelman they are  also subject to all kinds of bias issues. Science relies on verification/reproducibility.
jasonkincaid	655040770991230980	2015-10-16T15:21:04	heathwblack joshelman exactly. I want to see evidence they haven't used humans as uninformed guinea pigs. Their response has been abysmal.
jasonkincaid	654506926210846725	2015-10-15T03:59:46	Kantrowitz BuzzFeedBen I think many tech demos give media an "optimized" exp. Lingo about teaching the AI makes it sound like... not AI
