KT_Anna	713192292698484736	2016-03-25T02:34:27	So I didn't find a picture of my friend Scott tonight, but I did find a reminder of how sweet and simple life can be. And that works for me.
KT_Anna	713191943216447488	2016-03-25T02:33:04	If we're really lucky, maybe we get to be like that couple on the beach. I don't know. But it seems like something worth working for...
KT_Anna	713190676285014017	2016-03-25T02:28:02	Turns out life was a lot simpler back then...but isn't that the way life goes. We learn and grow and somehow figure out what is important.

KT_Anna	713188432462409728	2016-03-25T02:19:07	This week, I lost a dear friend. For days, I've been trying to find a picture of us to send to his family. So. Many. Boxes. Nothing.
KT_Anna	713187474651086848	2016-03-25T02:15:18	To me, that image represented everything worth working for in life. I've thought about that couple so many times over the years.
KT_Anna	713186951856259072	2016-03-25T02:13:14	He had a cane for balance. She stood right beside him. It was such a simple moment. It was beautiful. I took a picture.
KT_Anna	713186238887555072	2016-03-25T02:10:24	So on the beach that day I looked up and saw an elderly couple. They were holding hands and taking in the view.
KT_Anna	713185765291925506	2016-03-25T02:08:31	Of course, I was broke. But so were all my friends. That's the beauty of being in your 20s.
KT_Anna	713185313418579968	2016-03-25T02:06:43	I had so many big dreams in my 20s. Huge career. Happy family. Amazing friends. A house. A potty trained dog. That's the future I imagined.
KT_Anna	713184630548144132	2016-03-25T02:04:00	Ten years ago, almost to the week, I was reading a book on the beach. Life seemed so complicated back then...of course it really wasn't.
