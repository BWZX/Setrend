DismantleFed	413395696004247552	2013-12-18T19:49:49	Smaulgld Lee_Adler AlanTonelson Will blow a bigger hole in our fiscal deficit. A lot of our debt in recent years has been short term.
DismantleFed	413395115181629440	2013-12-18T19:47:30	Lee_Adler DismantleFed AlanTonelson Why is tapering data dependent but the decision to keep rates low for years irrespective of data?
DismantleFed	413365173424885760	2013-12-18T17:48:31	AlanTonelson I'll be live retweeting all of the live tweets of Bernanke's psychopathic lies and bullshit.
DismantleFed	413390386921349120	2013-12-18T19:28:43	DismantleFed Fischer is definitely an expert policy maker &amp; excellent foreign relations plus influential with other central banks.
DismantleFed	413394211396808705	2013-12-18T19:43:55	DMAngeli Agree. He should leverage his experiences at World Bank, IMF, and Gov of Bank of Israel and help guide Janet Calamity Yellen.

DismantleFed	413383709560041472	2013-12-18T19:02:11	DMAngeli Hope he imposes his views &amp; redraw Fed's charter rather than Fed's failed policies define his views. Latter has been the norm.

DismantleFed	413383319108063232	2013-12-18T19:00:38	DMAngeli Thx. Dr. Fischer better be ready for the train wreck that both Greenspan and Bernanke have set in motion.

DismantleFed	413382913489518592	2013-12-18T18:59:01	Smaulgld jakkoa Yes it is tightening as I stated in a sarcastic manner. Fed morons want to pick and choose on how they define tightening.

DismantleFed	413212058801299456	2013-12-18T07:40:06	The real question for the Fed is not a tiny Taper, but can they stop QE? Fed bastards know they are trapped and markets will front run them.
DismantleFed	413211428368031744	2013-12-18T07:37:36	Fear of un-intended, un-quantifiable risks and diminishing returns (negative returns for Main St Econ) is the only driver of QE TAPER talk.
DismantleFed	413210638916141057	2013-12-18T07:34:28	A tiny cut in the rate of increase in fiscal spending is termed Austerity,but a tiny cut in QE aka Tapering is not tightening. Fed bastards
