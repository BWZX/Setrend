jonahkeri	726154036919959552	2016-04-29T20:59:48	Stebbinwolf I am not saying that. Rather, I'm saying that owners are capable of some nasty things the minute you give them wiggle room.

jonahkeri	726151842128777217	2016-04-29T20:51:05	dga8274 Agreed. Point is, this is what owners are capable of, the second union stops being vigilant.

jonahkeri	724986971324473344	2016-04-26T15:42:18	_shireenahmed_ Typically, invitees aren't given entire lineup when invited. I've now learned to ask for entire roster before agreeing.
jonahkeri	724985995985215488	2016-04-26T15:38:25	This Brad Stevens profile by the great Jackie MacMullan is one of the best articles I've ever read, on any topic. 
jonahkeri	724980818263707648	2016-04-26T15:17:51	Lahlahlindsey This can (and should) be a goal. It just takes extra thought. So the hope is to encourage that extra thought.
jonahkeri	724980619583705093	2016-04-26T15:17:03	Lahlahlindsey To get appropriate levels of diversity, organizers need to bring in significantly higher % of women/POC than industry has.
jonahkeri	724980432454832128	2016-04-26T15:16:19	Lahlahlindsey The industry is very heavily skewed toward one demo, sadly. So the easy move is to just dovetail with that demo.
jonahkeri	724979865129078785	2016-04-26T15:14:03	Lahlahlindsey Thank you. FYI organizer is receptive to expanding this/not repeating mistake and all parties are now on the same page.

jonahkeri	724978945389527040	2016-04-26T15:10:24	Lahlahlindsey I agree 100%. But things can change, and will be changed. Mistakes suck, but they are also an opportunity for improvement.
jonahkeri	724978201458417664	2016-04-26T15:07:27	Lahlahlindsey tl;dr - it's being handled, and thank you for pointing it out
jonahkeri	724978064128528385	2016-04-26T15:06:54	Lahlahlindsey No no, I mean I am on it. As in I didn't realize lack of diversity before and have since sent 10 non-white dude suggestions.

jonahkeri	716296895522418690	2016-04-02T16:11:02	In conclusion friends, go have kids, because they're f'ing hilarious.
jonahkeri	716296557134548992	2016-04-02T16:09:42	We've batted all the way through both lineups. Leadoff hitter has cried continuously since beginning of game, has not hit nor fielded.
jonahkeri	716296475232174080	2016-04-02T16:09:22	E 3rd baseman. In the excitement of a solid hit he joined the kid on 3rd in running home.
jonahkeri	716296339097694208	2016-04-02T16:08:50	Runner had a nice hit but fell down under the weight of the batting helmet halfway between home and 1st.
jonahkeri	716296244402892803	2016-04-02T16:08:27	The one skilled kid on the other team just hit a triple, passing the previous batter who stayed put on 2nd.
jonahkeri	716296179915436033	2016-04-02T16:08:12	The runner en route from 1st to 2nd just helpfully picked up the ball in play and handed it to the fielder.
jonahkeri	716296092258676740	2016-04-02T16:07:51	They have to pause the game bc all the kids are staring at an airplane passing overhead.
jonahkeri	716296030707318785	2016-04-02T16:07:36	T is fielding facing 180 degrees away from home, staring straight at E on 2nd.
jonahkeri	716295916391501824	2016-04-02T16:07:09	E had only real solid hit so far. Then he ran to sit in bleachers instead of 1st. Meanwhile fielder ran the ball to 1st instead of throwing.
jonahkeri	716295752788500485	2016-04-02T16:06:30	They had to pinch hit for the leadoff hitter because he wouldn't stop crying.
jonahkeri	716295662069940224	2016-04-02T16:06:08	E&amp;T are incompetent but at least they aren't the ones repeatedly rolling on the grass.
jonahkeri	716295089237004288	2016-04-02T16:03:52	1st tee-ball practice. Age 3-6 is a WIDE range. (My kids are 6.5 and insanely tall)
jonahkeri	716294960039927808	2016-04-02T16:03:21	So while I'm in Montreal for Baseball-Palooza, my wife is watching my 6-year-old twins' 1st T-ball game. I am now going to tweet her reports

jonahkeri	712306135282225153	2016-03-22T15:53:11	Pernellius in the chained approach to measuring inflation chicken gets a smaller weight in t+1, and pork gets a higher weight.
jonahkeri	712306073672110080	2016-03-22T15:52:56	Pernellius in the CPI calc… the weight will stay constant… but in reality, people will eat less of it
jonahkeri	712306022531006468	2016-03-22T15:52:44	Pernellius Chain weighting adjusts basket each period rather than keep the basket fixed. Example: suppose the price of chicken skyrockets
jonahkeri	712305916394151937	2016-03-22T15:52:19	Pernellius  the CPI is based on basket of goods-they fix weights in particular year &amp; ask how much would that basket cost 1 year from now?
jonahkeri	712305771778670592	2016-03-22T15:51:44	Pernellius There’s very little difference between the two indices, for starters. But re: wonky/detailed side of it...
