RPSeawright	712877875867828224	2016-03-24T05:45:04	acs204 You're macing a textualist argument. I thought you were an originalist.

RPSeawright	712874750473797632	2016-03-24T05:32:39	EWErickson  This is a low blow worthy of Trump.
RPSeawright	712873277656535040	2016-03-24T05:26:48	acs204 plaidgramma There is no plausible argument to exclude Cruz other than an originalist argument.

RPSeawright	712867796963733506	2016-03-24T05:05:01	PaulSchmehl Supporting Cruz as a last resort against Trump is hardly a ringing endorsement.
RPSeawright	712867378690973697	2016-03-24T05:03:22	acs204 plaidgramma The first rule of originalism is plain meaning. The plain meaning of "natural born" is pretty plain.

RPSeawright	712864454707388416	2016-03-24T04:51:45	PaulSchmehl JonahNRO No he doesn't.  And Reagan and Cruz are polar opposites in personality.
RPSeawright	712863493729423362	2016-03-24T04:47:55	PaulSchmehl JonahNRO HRC is already a historically weak candidate, yet Cruz trails her in the polls now, before the attacks really start.

RPSeawright	712854566761590784	2016-03-24T04:12:27	wilsonkanaday JonahNRO Since HRC is historically weak as a candidate. essentially any Republican should (but Trump and Cruz won't).
RPSeawright	712853814089490433	2016-03-24T04:09:28	plaidgramma If he were a consistent Originalist, he would preclude himself from serving as not native born (though that;s not the law now).
RPSeawright	712852976784769024	2016-03-24T04:06:08	wilsonkanaday JonahNRO Not sure what you're asking, but Trump is unfit for Chicago City Council, the lowest U.S. bar that comes to mind.
