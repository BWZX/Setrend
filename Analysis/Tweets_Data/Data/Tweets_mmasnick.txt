mmasnick	725010683444645889	2016-04-26T17:16:31	lutherlowe benthompson i don't think microsoft was even paying attention to search until ~2002, at which point it was too late.
mmasnick	725008679079014400	2016-04-26T17:08:33	lutherlowe benthompson don't think so. by the time search was important, doj had already stopped paying attention to MSFT
mmasnick	725008076718231552	2016-04-26T17:06:10	lutherlowe benthompson i'm siding with Ben on this one. MSFT was way, way, way behind on search. No easy way for them to win that one.

mmasnick	722438837100756992	2016-04-19T14:56:55	This is wrong. Apple did not "have a key" it has now lost. It just encrypted less of the data on the phone with the user passcode.
mmasnick	722438531050770434	2016-04-19T14:55:42	This debate has become so polarized, but there just HAS to be a way to get halfway pregnant.
mmasnick	722438471927865344	2016-04-19T14:55:28	But they're not buying the terrorist thing anymore. What should we do?  I know... 
mmasnick	722438078028099584	2016-04-19T14:53:54	So I'm finally able to watch the hearing... and I already regret it.
mmasnick	722437470462296064	2016-04-19T14:51:29	It might be illuminating to have law enforcement  &amp; techs on the same panel so some of this silliness could get realtime response.
mmasnick	722437536920940546	2016-04-19T14:51:45	I see that the anti-crypto hearing has now been turned into an "OMG child porn!" hearing.
mmasnick	722437079930638337	2016-04-19T14:49:56	"I haven't bothered to become minimally educated about the security problems Apple was trying to solve, so let's assume there are none."
mmasnick	722436352491388928	2016-04-19T14:47:03	For some reason the YouTube stream of the Congressional encryption hearing won't load for me.
mmasnick	722435211078844416	2016-04-19T14:42:31	Do child predators hiding by the playground generally email about it? encryption
mmasnick	722435267123154944	2016-04-19T14:42:44	But what about when we didn't have tiny supercomputers in our pockets leaking personal info about ourselves
mmasnick	722434606138552321	2016-04-19T14:40:06	Most annoying encryption phenomenon: LE talks "warrant-proof encryption" &amp; "strong encryption," ignores that those are the EXACT same thing
mmasnick	722434251002499072	2016-04-19T14:38:42	Serious point: "warrant proof" toilets have probably disrupted more convictions than warrant-proof crypto. 
mmasnick	722431935939768320	2016-04-19T14:29:30	Can we talk about how much *easier* monitoring has become? How one order to Google can obtain what used to require multiple physical raids?

mmasnick	710589235263213569	2016-03-17T22:10:50	I recognize that twitter understaffed tweetdeck and it ignores nearly all complaints. So sure, they'd want to shut down part of it, but...
mmasnick	710585163667755008	2016-03-17T21:54:39	So first twitter kills off all competing standalone apps, then it kills desktop tweetdeck. WTF.
mmasnick	710584588754497536	2016-03-17T21:52:22	Fucking hell. It's like twitter and jack are proactively making it more of a pain for its most loyal users.

mmasnick	710576446356324352	2016-03-17T21:20:01	Okay twitter, help me out. Month or so ago someone posted an "eclipse" graphic to demonstrate "going dark" v. "going light." Who tweeted it?

mmasnick	709879752291516416	2016-03-15T23:11:36	KDbyProxy not quite the point apple is making. much more nuanced about what CALEA actually covers. tough to explain in 140 chars...
mmasnick	709879407817523200	2016-03-15T23:10:14	Heh. Apple has ad exec declare that the company has never advertised "blocking law enforcement" as a feature 
mmasnick	709877998615273472	2016-03-15T23:04:38	KDbyProxy agreed that this is likely the weakest argument. but, the larger point may still win. CALEA governs here, not AWA

mmasnick	708286637395025921	2016-03-11T13:41:08	I wonder where the DOJ's brief against Apple fits in to the gov't's plan to work collaboratively with the tech companies.

mmasnick	708073390108758016	2016-03-10T23:33:46	I think the biggest takeaway from the DOJ's filing is that if you value your freedom, never voluntarily cooperate with the DOJ.

mmasnick	707994365130477568	2016-03-10T18:19:45	wolmanj i think people should have the right to use an ad blocker to protect their own security. seems hypocritical not to help them.
mmasnick	707993406362898432	2016-03-10T18:15:56	wolmanj and i think that's a bad strategy.
mmasnick	707993338285142016	2016-03-10T18:15:40	wolmanj agree. i mean, obviously we use ads as a part of our biz model. but i think that fighting ad blockers is anti-user.

mmasnick	704732623302758400	2016-03-01T18:18:45	Ouch.  Conyers takes a shot at Bob Litt’s “cynical mindset” &amp; possibility FBI is “exploiting a national tragedy” to get legal change.

mmasnick	703638659514273792	2016-02-27T17:51:44	MikeTaylor there are a lot of issues. best explanation here: 
mmasnick	703628276711837697	2016-02-27T17:10:28	In its first day, got over 100 backers of our crowdfunding project (avg donation $60+!!!). What are you waiting for? 
mmasnick	703626043345625088	2016-02-27T17:01:36	MikeTaylor and the precedent. Lots of law enforcement want this. So everytime they ask risk goes up of it leaking
mmasnick	703625749031292928	2016-02-27T17:00:25	MikeTaylor yeah. No one is asking for that. But issue is that it could still get out. Such code would be a real target
mmasnick	703618016253116416	2016-02-27T16:29:42	MikeTaylor er..  says
mmasnick	703617954903031813	2016-02-27T16:29:27	MikeTaylor same thing. What you're suggesting is what court order days
mmasnick	703613579296006145	2016-02-27T16:12:04	MikeTaylor how does that change anything? Issue is still the precedent of being required to hack a customer
mmasnick	703467685779116032	2016-02-27T06:32:20	The deal should be he's allowed to try and if he fails, he's not allowed to ever make a public statement again  
mmasnick	703468579178434560	2016-02-27T06:35:53	Funny. I've actually seen these cones around and wondered more than once about the potential trademark issues. 
mmasnick	703423872196947968	2016-02-27T03:38:14	xylinxdan no. I'm well informed of what he said he'd do as well as multiple defamation lawsuits he's filed. His views are at odds with 1A
mmasnick	703402843684761600	2016-02-27T02:14:41	xylinxdan his explanation would mean changing libel laws in a manner that clearly goes against 1st amendment case law.
mmasnick	703402592534007809	2016-02-27T02:13:41	xylinxdan no. who said that?
mmasnick	700353933366026243	2016-02-18T16:19:24	Simple security rule of thumb: don't build encryption for how the world is today, but how it could be if Donald Trump were President.

mmasnick	703376026596839424	2016-02-27T00:28:07	Hey piersmorgan, first clue: no one says the opening can't be done. It's the closing part that's the issue.

mmasnick	703286610930970624	2016-02-26T18:32:49	I took Disney's letter to employees asking them to help pay for Disney's lobbyists and... annotated it. 
mmasnick	703286066422292481	2016-02-26T18:30:39	It's Friday!  Why is there so much news happening...
mmasnick	703284409093349376	2016-02-26T18:24:04	benthompson normative emptywheel ah, ok. from the context in the podcast, felt like you were overselling what CALEA requires.
mmasnick	703282971940290560	2016-02-26T18:18:21	benthompson also pretty sure that's not true.  :)  perhaps emptywheel or normative know?
mmasnick	703279910530318337	2016-02-26T18:06:11	benthompson pretty sure that's not true. do you have a citation?
mmasnick	703277146806972416	2016-02-26T17:55:12	Listening to new benthompson jamesallworth podcast. Good discussion, but Ben completely misrepresents CALEA. Confuses it with FISA 702.
mmasnick	703252997611122688	2016-02-26T16:19:15	Holy shit. This is a thing that actually happened on TV. 
mmasnick	703258442127904768	2016-02-26T16:40:53	Once again. What is this, the 184th such study?  
mmasnick	703236443498553344	2016-02-26T15:13:28	honer: one that hones () leightweight: We have no. idea.  chocker:  
mmasnick	703240725224255488	2016-02-26T15:30:29	schlockdaddy KarlBode completely. it's dead.
mmasnick	703226240480759808	2016-02-26T14:32:55	One year after the FCC embraced Title II the Internet no longer works. Just like all the fauxcademics and industry sockpuppets claimed...
mmasnick	703222641553879041	2016-02-26T14:18:37	This email. closedaccess phylogenomics

mmasnick	703202688671080448	2016-02-26T12:59:20	Do people really think Apple decided to pick a fight over THIS phone as a PR stunt? WHY? They have a dozen more sympathetic cases.
mmasnick	703201038413795328	2016-02-26T12:52:47	Anyone who tells you they're going to achieve savings by trimming "waste, fraud, and abuse" is (a) lying &amp; (b) thinks you're stupid.
mmasnick	703104035339915265	2016-02-26T06:27:19	When journos get weepy about the collapse in trust of the press, ask if they think their coverage helped citizens understand this election?
mmasnick	703018305817149440	2016-02-26T00:46:40	Seriously, if you're hating on our coverage about the crypto fight solely because you dislike our stance on copyright law, you have issues.
mmasnick	703016879607001088	2016-02-26T00:41:00	wolmanj shoulda waited!
mmasnick	703003786701189120	2016-02-25T23:48:58	We Read Apple's 65 Page Filing Calling Bullshit On The Justice Department, So You Don't Have To 
mmasnick	702987658457325568	2016-02-25T22:44:53	FBiOS was better, but at least marginally confusing to people who saw it and thought "BIOS?" 
mmasnick	702960305240875009	2016-02-25T20:56:11	NSA_PR techdirt heh. didn't know you're on that list.  but of course.  :)
mmasnick	702955513131233280	2016-02-25T20:37:09	If anyone is still saying that it's Apple that is using this case for PR, they have it backward 
mmasnick	702951419419058177	2016-02-25T20:20:53	I like how sarahemclaugh is now full time on the "Erdogan reacting badly to 'insults' beat." 
mmasnick	702950596232548352	2016-02-25T20:17:36	Claim made by lawyer whose wife died in 9/11 attack: 
mmasnick	702872235103678466	2016-02-25T15:06:14	The FBI Director, who just told Congress he's not a good lawyer, now offering his expert views on computer security. 
mmasnick	702609074349871104	2016-02-24T21:40:31	Does the RIAA's reaction to the nextloc appointment seem vaguely threatening to you? 
mmasnick	702878752565362688	2016-02-25T15:32:08	That's not good... 
mmasnick	702475496337121280	2016-02-24T12:49:44	FBI vs Apple ..

mmasnick	702871914084069376	2016-02-25T15:04:57	stuartdredge interesting theory. but not sure it's truly supported. but perhaps a fun thing to look into.

mmasnick	702674590674255872	2016-02-25T02:00:52	documentcloud trying to upload. keep getting "internal server error"
mmasnick	702627558689406976	2016-02-24T22:53:58	The RIAA seems awful scared of how a librarian might want to promote the progress of science and useful arts 
mmasnick	702369968218906624	2016-02-24T05:50:24	CANADA: everything OK down there? USA: we're fine CANADA: it's just that it looks a bit messed u- USA: i said WE'RE FINE
mmasnick	702600107573829632	2016-02-24T21:04:53	Results of this poll are pretty surprising to me. 45% of journalists don't know what two-factor auth is? 
mmasnick	702583016992829440	2016-02-24T19:56:59	It's threats-about-dicks-month apparently.  Techdirt got one as well. 
mmasnick	702639342171267072	2016-02-24T23:40:48	kennethn rklau also, where can i get me one of those things?
mmasnick	702639206481289216	2016-02-24T23:40:15	kennethn rklau well, until the FBI mandated backdoor was applied.
mmasnick	702638564060696576	2016-02-24T23:37:42	mshawndavis not the point.
mmasnick	702638356144885760	2016-02-24T23:36:53	kennethn rklau some call it the good fight, other's call it quixotic obsessions with meaningless trivia. tomato, tomahto.
mmasnick	702637477299814400	2016-02-24T23:33:23	LorenRaeDeJ fair point.
mmasnick	702636627307331584	2016-02-24T23:30:00	kennethn rklau otherwise not clear how he would know which guy it was.
mmasnick	702636506964307968	2016-02-24T23:29:32	Seems like a valid question: "If Fourth-Year Presidents Shouldn't Do Things, How About Sixth-Year Senators?" 
mmasnick	702636314609332225	2016-02-24T23:28:46	kennethn rklau been arguing all morning that the "hack" was looking over his shoulder. most likely scenario.
mmasnick	702631597963505665	2016-02-24T23:10:01	alexisohanian better tag would be "50% more influential..."  :)

mmasnick	702566722876735489	2016-02-24T18:52:14	maira i still think the guy just looked over his shoulder
mmasnick	702565816974217216	2016-02-24T18:48:38	wexler hey i made that joke earlier.  :)
mmasnick	702565296918306816	2016-02-24T18:46:34	NSQE CathyGellis announcement discusses open access, more access to info. good signs.
mmasnick	702561226560139264	2016-02-24T18:30:24	normative there's a reason for that: 
mmasnick	702558685424320513	2016-02-24T18:20:18	snlester true. i should have been more clear. but effectively the idea of TPA is for Congress to have less say
mmasnick	702558032736092160	2016-02-24T18:17:42	normative zittrain seems entirely possible the guy just *looked over the reporter's shoulder* from that story...
mmasnick	702554754350583808	2016-02-24T18:04:40	mmasnick thus fulfilling my contractual obligations as a Techdirt contributor 
mmasnick	702525558601572353	2016-02-24T16:08:40	Now they'll never get those press credentials 
mmasnick	702553656089055235	2016-02-24T18:00:19	"Andromedical can take its DMCA notice and pump it." mmasnick coins a new term of art for the legal profession: 
mmasnick	702552468228419584	2016-02-24T17:55:35	Good point by AsherLangton. Seems more likely guy just looked over reporter's shoulder on this "hacked" story: 
mmasnick	702551911665303554	2016-02-24T17:53:23	AsherLangton yeah, i wondered that. how else would the guy know who was the reporter?
mmasnick	702551743838625792	2016-02-24T17:52:43	darthskeptic the amazing thing? both companies sent threats from "legal#@domain.com". Roca was "legal3" This one was "legal4"
mmasnick	702549994889326593	2016-02-24T17:45:46	Yeah. That's the part of this story that's the strangest. 
mmasnick	702548273219768321	2016-02-24T17:38:55	Heh. TIME not just repeating widely debunked story, but inflating it to something way more wrong. Journalism! 
mmasnick	702547591133696000	2016-02-24T17:36:13	Penis pump co. says it's reporting us to INTERPOL for "trafficking in illicit goods" because we made fun of them 
mmasnick	702543478694129664	2016-02-24T17:19:52	Meanwhile, our response to a legal threat coming in about 10 minutes. Teaser: it involves penis pumps. Really.
mmasnick	702542827658440704	2016-02-24T17:17:17	Of course, if the Senate is refusing to even consider SCOTUS justice in an election year, does that apply to Librarian of Congress too?
mmasnick	702542350782849024	2016-02-24T17:15:23	But watch how the legacy players FREAK out and use this as even more of an excuse for why they want to move Copyright Office elsewhere.
mmasnick	702542188605931520	2016-02-24T17:14:45	The fact that the announcement talks a lot about open access to information is a really good sign too...  
mmasnick	702541801262092288	2016-02-24T17:13:12	Outspoken critic of Patriot Act &amp; NSLs nominated by President as new Librarian of Congress.

mmasnick	702515156924788736	2016-02-24T15:27:20	Heads up. Likely posting our latest response to a dumb legal threat sometime this morning...
mmasnick	702514643692949504	2016-02-24T15:25:17	whitneymcn i mean, for fuck's sake, it's WIRED. it's embarassing that they don't know what they're doing.
mmasnick	702514258928504832	2016-02-24T15:23:46	whitneymcn yeah, me too. but i figured that  WIRED would at least have a better implementation than forbes. but nope.
mmasnick	702513597830705152	2016-02-24T15:21:08	MichaelCarusi yup. forbes too. thought that wired would at least have its tech shit together. guess not.
mmasnick	702513033197715456	2016-02-24T15:18:53	Fucking wired. I'm not using an ad blocker and they're still telling me to turn mine off. Will link to another site I guess.
mmasnick	702405536390770688	2016-02-24T08:11:44	normative declanm must be.
mmasnick	702404811879223296	2016-02-24T08:08:51	normative declanm and why do they leave out the fact that McConnell is vice chair of Booz Allen?
mmasnick	702300125142585345	2016-02-24T01:12:52	Confirming a Supreme Court Justice is like getting pandas to fuck now. Everything has to be just right.
mmasnick	702286759720198144	2016-02-24T00:19:46	mquirion sure. still disappointing.
mmasnick	702286181975744513	2016-02-24T00:17:28	More ex-distributed services increasingly moving to a centralized model. Disappointing. 
mmasnick	702251215531307008	2016-02-23T21:58:31	But that's gogo's entire business model. Captive market. High prices. Shit product.  
mmasnick	702188102048202753	2016-02-23T17:47:44	ICE says its FOIA officers' names are secret. 
mmasnick	702200206205423616	2016-02-23T18:35:50	endofobjects benthompson jamesallworth i'd say a close second to my own, but sure. :)  it's really good.
mmasnick	702199742252523521	2016-02-23T18:33:59	Probably everyone knows this already, but I just started listening to benthompson and jamesallworth's podcast and it's REALLY good.
mmasnick	702192385917263872	2016-02-23T18:04:45	So, you think the FBI vs Apple fight is about 1 terrorist's phone? Think again. 
mmasnick	702192450496917504	2016-02-23T18:05:00	slhtonz i think that's a tough argument. eula almost certainly includes that it's ok to respond to legit law enforcement/court orders.
mmasnick	702174693919358976	2016-02-23T16:54:27	kashhill the list of 12: 
mmasnick	702155454776889344	2016-02-23T15:38:00	Buckle up folks, it seems like we've got another day with a ton of Apple/FBI stories...
mmasnick	702154965146402816	2016-02-23T15:36:03	Oooh, one of the purest, undistilled specimens of denial I've seen in a long, long time. 
mmasnick	701896524129820678	2016-02-22T22:29:06	Remember when FBI &amp; NYPD were urging us to use full disk encryption to protect our security?

mmasnick	701879426980646913	2016-02-22T21:21:10	The debate &amp; reporting on the Apple/San Bernardino case swings wildly between impressive technical precision and frightening misinformation.

mmasnick	701915462225891328	2016-02-22T23:44:21	In order to respond to our latest legal threat, I need to do some searches that, out of context, are going to look pretty bad.
mmasnick	701906233377185792	2016-02-22T23:07:41	That_AC stay tuned!
mmasnick	701824850986475520	2016-02-22T17:44:18	Gosh, I can’t until the NSA &amp; FBI have to take orders from a guy who thinks like this.   
mmasnick	701795506888912897	2016-02-22T15:47:42	New week, new stupid legal threat to techdirt.  Perhaps more stupid than usual.
mmasnick	701785596218445824	2016-02-22T15:08:19	Claim Apple is doing this "only" for PR benefit is bizarre: PR in refusing FBI's demand to open phone of Muslim who mass-murdered Americans?
mmasnick	701792461945831424	2016-02-22T15:35:36	bureau_13 yeah. that's the point. why he keeps saying that
mmasnick	701785250402168834	2016-02-22T15:06:56	He's been saying this since 2013. Why do people keep reporting it as new?

mmasnick	694260388716683264	2016-02-01T20:45:50	livebeef ... is a cool idea that other brands/shows should adopt. imagine other fan films/books/etc  thefinebros
mmasnick	694260189608869888	2016-02-01T20:45:02	livebeef take away thefinebros stupid reaction to perfectly fine ellen segment, and the UNDERLYING IDEA of helping others create vids...
mmasnick	694259958594973696	2016-02-01T20:44:07	livebeef i know. but again you're comparing two different things. thefinebros
mmasnick	694259710174695428	2016-02-01T20:43:08	livebeef ... that's different than looking at thefinebros underlying idea of creating tools to help fans do more videos (2/2)
mmasnick	694259557783080960	2016-02-01T20:42:31	livebeef it's fine to point out that thefinebros have done obnoxious and wrong things in the past... but (1/2)
mmasnick	694259420201488384	2016-02-01T20:41:59	livebeef thefinebros that's why i said their past actions undermined. but getting (stupidly) mad is DIFFERENT issue than what they set up
mmasnick	694256802024697857	2016-02-01T20:31:34	livebeef but looks like thefinebros history of bogus complaints may have undermined a cool idea.

mmasnick	693268535464701953	2016-01-30T03:04:33	It's cynical and shortsighted to claim that security and privacy are incompatible with the open web. These ideals aren't at all at odds.

mmasnick	693232655261900800	2016-01-30T00:41:59	To be clear, ashk4n didn't cause any Snowden docs to leak. He made our NSA stories better &amp; fairer--and the workspace far more secure.

mmasnick	693231188425576448	2016-01-30T00:36:09	Most ridiculous part: ashk4n was supposed to help attract good techies to gov't. Blocking him does the exact opposite. Stupid.
mmasnick	693222194357280769	2016-01-30T00:00:25	Uh... guessing this is because of his work on snowden docs. If true, that's *fucked* up.

mmasnick	693152930191396864	2016-01-29T19:25:11	kpoulsen of all the people to give a bullshit FOIA response to, I'm guessing JasonLeopold is the worst one to target.
mmasnick	693151953874857984	2016-01-29T19:21:18	amyzima thanks. happy to know someone actually exists on the other end. :)

mmasnick	693151244425101312	2016-01-29T19:18:29	amyzima wondering if it's somehow related to the keyboard shortcut issue. my guess at least.
mmasnick	693151131980029952	2016-01-29T19:18:02	amyzima desktop
mmasnick	693149475624263682	2016-01-29T19:11:27	amyzima and for some reason when i click "reply" to my own tweet (as here) it now includes my own user name too. didn't used to.
mmasnick	693149309106155521	2016-01-29T19:10:48	amyzima 2 more small bugs (just saw one now): tweet box just closed on me as i was typing. no reason.
mmasnick	693149093955121152	2016-01-29T19:09:56	amyzima so was beginning to wonder if anyone was still working on tweetdeck
mmasnick	693148981468082176	2016-01-29T19:09:29	amyzima i appreciate it.  :) been tweeting and even dm'd tweetdeck account many times and never got any response.
mmasnick	693146826493460480	2016-01-29T19:00:56	amyzima yes, always happening while typing. basically every single time i type a tweet.
mmasnick	693146694020497408	2016-01-29T19:00:24	amyzima i haven't seen that today, but mathewi did so he can point you to his.
mmasnick	693146507692773376	2016-01-29T18:59:40	amyzima if that "show more tweets" is absolutely necessary, at least when i click on it, have it keep me where i was in the stream
mmasnick	693146321436303360	2016-01-29T18:58:55	amyzima 5. not a bug, but while i've got your attention ;) this damn thing is the bane of my existence. 
mmasnick	693146049351802880	2016-01-29T18:57:50	amyzima 4. last week real time stream stopped working for at least a few hours (maybe a whole day), but seems to be working again,
mmasnick	693145352208195585	2016-01-29T18:55:04	amyzima 3. many @ replies don't seem to show in tweetdeck column any  more.  it's kind of random.
mmasnick	693145206275768320	2016-01-29T18:54:29	amyzima that's the biggest part.  the fact that you can't use tweetdeck to TWEET seems like a big deal.  and others have reported same
mmasnick	693145010498174976	2016-01-29T18:53:43	amyzima usually deleting whatever tweet i'd already started to write.
mmasnick	693144947155800064	2016-01-29T18:53:28	amyzima or sometimes, as I'm typing it'll just magically change the "focus" to a column and randomly scroll through that column
mmasnick	693144767111102464	2016-01-29T18:52:45	amyzima for unclear reasons, as i type in the box, it will suddenly turn the tweet box into a DM box. or search box
mmasnick	693144620637683712	2016-01-29T18:52:10	amyzima haha.  check that, it happens if you're replying in a column too cause it just happened to me.  hold on switching to web...
mmasnick	693144324838567937	2016-01-29T18:50:59	amyzima 2. if you're tweeting from the main tweet box (i.e., not a response in a column) the app is basically unusable... (more...)
mmasnick	693144117451198464	2016-01-29T18:50:10	amyzima 1. app will regularly "freeze" for 10 to 20 seconds for no reason (can't click, can't scroll, etc.)
mmasnick	693143888534503424	2016-01-29T18:49:15	amyzima how much time do you have?  :)
mmasnick	693140575420190720	2016-01-29T18:36:05	exiledsurfer mathewi eriks Support TweetDeck janetter was killed by twitter already. looking for desktop not phone app
mmasnick	693138400937775104	2016-01-29T18:27:27	eriks mathewi Support TweetDeck there's nothing. Twitter flat out killed all reasonable alternatives.
mmasnick	693138292615696384	2016-01-29T18:27:01	mathewi yup. twitter lists and the tweetdeck interface is the only reason twitter is useful. and they're destroying it. and don't care.
mmasnick	693137867824992257	2016-01-29T18:25:20	Falkvinge mathewi i kind of mocked people who get upset about twitter changes, but a broken TweetDeck vastly hurts twitter.
mmasnick	693137488424992768	2016-01-29T18:23:49	Falkvinge mathewi but the web interface removes nearly all of the value of twitter for me as compared to tweetdeck
mmasnick	693137394095099904	2016-01-29T18:23:27	Falkvinge mathewi nothing. twitter killed off all competitors. tried a few stragglers, and they're awful. just using the web.
mmasnick	693137171713163264	2016-01-29T18:22:34	mathewi Support and without TweetDeck twitter itself loses tremendous value. it's been super disappointing.
mmasnick	693136954561425408	2016-01-29T18:21:42	mathewi Support i used to use TweetDeck 100% of my twitter interactions, but in the last month I'm increasingly forced out of it.
mmasnick	693136784901799937	2016-01-29T18:21:02	mathewi Support yes. as i've been noting, tweetdeck has basically become an unusable mess and they don't respond to any requests at all.
mmasnick	693093131076538369	2016-01-29T15:27:34	That_AC worth noting that the paper actually calls out Prenda by name...

mmasnick	692878132127277056	2016-01-29T01:13:14	livebeef csolisr yeah, that was tone deaf. but the underlying idea is interesting actually. may write something.

mmasnick	692876981449261057	2016-01-29T01:08:40	livebeef csolisr which is actually a creative approach.
mmasnick	692876891275993089	2016-01-29T01:08:18	livebeef csolisr looks more like a way for them to give an official stamp of approval on others vids and promote them &amp; then share revenue
mmasnick	692876702322548736	2016-01-29T01:07:33	livebeef csolisr i don't think that's true. i think that's how everyone's interpreting it.
mmasnick	692876361627602944	2016-01-29T01:06:12	mathewi i did the same thing starting 2 weeks ago.  i actually think it's pretty cool now, once you get past the learning curve.
mmasnick	692874942866534401	2016-01-29T01:00:34	csolisr huh. interesting. actually seems like a good idea by them, and everyone freaked out.

mmasnick	684443301479596033	2016-01-05T18:36:14	I'm more concerned with twitter's proposed 8,000 character minimum. That just seems like a bad idea, tbh.

mmasnick	684455358220259328	2016-01-05T19:24:08	So the core Twitter experience might not change that much, with the 140 character lines, but the additional text could be useful.
mmasnick	684455056834301952	2016-01-05T19:22:56	People are freaking out about the 10,000 character tweets, but the planned implementation doesn't sound crazy. Works like embedded vids/pics

mmasnick	684164601324244992	2016-01-05T00:08:46	lhfang craigsheppard look at the details of those studies. they're not saying what you seem to think they're saying.
mmasnick	684164218782744578	2016-01-05T00:07:15	lhfang craigsheppard so, you're arguing that because *users* have trouble distinguishing it means *advertisers* want to deceive? really?
mmasnick	684163888573628416	2016-01-05T00:05:56	lhfang craigsheppard you're changing your argument...
mmasnick	684163217338138624	2016-01-05T00:03:16	craigsheppard lhfang and that's too bad, since I respect his reporting and link to it regularly. This is disappointing in many regards.
mmasnick	684163112493121536	2016-01-05T00:02:51	craigsheppard lhfang i've tried to explain, but he thinks i'm offended. I'm not. I'm trying to educate and he prefers ignorance.
mmasnick	684163003315404802	2016-01-05T00:02:25	craigsheppard lhfang Lee is confusing the two, suggesting little experience in the real world of how this actually works.
mmasnick	684162886604726272	2016-01-05T00:01:57	craigsheppard lhfang there's a difference between making GOOD CONTENT that is also advertising and making DECEPTIVE content.
mmasnick	684162748612132866	2016-01-05T00:01:25	craigsheppard lhfang i do deal with many. and deception is not the goal of any serious one we've spoken to. Lee is wrong.
mmasnick	684162350459404288	2016-01-04T23:59:50	lhfang craigsheppard it doesn't offend. you're just wrong. saying so makes you look ignorant. i'm surprised at you.
mmasnick	684161114351898625	2016-01-04T23:54:55	lhfang craigsheppard and to take what medium is saying as plans to deceive is, frankly, a total distortion. you're better than that.
mmasnick	684160993757282304	2016-01-04T23:54:26	lhfang craigsheppard no doubt that there are some bad players, but most i've spoken to don't want to deceive. not much value in it.
mmasnick	684160639225344000	2016-01-04T23:53:02	craigsheppard lhfang is this "insidious"? 
mmasnick	684160061699014656	2016-01-04T23:50:44	lhfang craigsheppard i think your view of advertisers is somewhat distorted. i actually work with many. do you?
mmasnick	684159195822690304	2016-01-04T23:47:18	craigsheppard lhfang deceptive native advertising may happen in practice, but it's dumb. destroys trust.
mmasnick	684159066940166144	2016-01-04T23:46:47	craigsheppard lhfang we've had lots of success with full disclosed native ads that were also good content.
mmasnick	684158977525940224	2016-01-04T23:46:25	lhfang craigsheppard not at all. we've worked with plenty of advertisers who recognize value of full disclosure + good content.
mmasnick	684158554849214464	2016-01-04T23:44:45	craigsheppard lhfang no. that's wrong. proper native advertising is about creating *well disclosed* ad content that *people want*.
mmasnick	684157974240100352	2016-01-04T23:42:26	This is a *really* unfair description of native advertising. Done right it does not involve deception. 
mmasnick	684094687083233280	2016-01-04T19:30:57	Another "win" for forbes idiotic take on ad blockers.

mmasnick	684084821165932544	2016-01-04T18:51:45	TonyRomm my reading of the exceptions was that it's just for cameras and such:

mmasnick	684083624002506752	2016-01-04T18:47:00	TonyRomm so i pulled out the one other (smaller) backpack to see if i could cram everything in... and it's larger than the listsed size too
