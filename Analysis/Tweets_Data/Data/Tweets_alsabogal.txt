alsabogal	726097145074487296	2016-04-29T17:13:44	Good way to play for SPY  bounce IMO decide how many shares you'd normally buy, divide by 100, buy that amt of today expiry 205.5c for 65c
alsabogal	726095415100076032	2016-04-29T17:06:51	would not rule out a snapper

alsabogal	726079286873038850	2016-04-29T16:02:46	I respect bearish or not as bullish calls at 2100 but most of the guys bearish at 2100 are the same ones from 1800..not guys who caught move
alsabogal	726078611233603584	2016-04-29T16:00:05	Chub519 are you placing big bets on downside?

alsabogal	726075019143577600	2016-04-29T15:45:49	SPX funny thing is i thought strong $ would be catalyst for selloff, meanwhile dollar keeps weakening which in theory s/b bullish!

alsabogal	725893413221089280	2016-04-29T03:44:10	LMTentarelli Thx buddy...right back at you!
alsabogal	725893244362579969	2016-04-29T03:43:30	PuruSaxenaWMgt so far your depressed longs vs SPX working nicely...you aren't as mega bearish as you make yourself out to be!
alsabogal	725892455799906304	2016-04-29T03:40:22	PuruSaxenaWMgt or as SPX does nothing...I just find it hard to have a ton of conviction either way here...you seem to think def down
alsabogal	725892136131039232	2016-04-29T03:39:06	PuruSaxenaWMgt yes, and you know my views as well...just seems odd that a 3-4% move totally invalidates your big SPX bear thesis
alsabogal	725891638623633408	2016-04-29T03:37:07	PuruSaxenaWMgt yes, but we're also seeing a big rotation into highly oversold cyclical names...it might not be ur scripted version of bull
alsabogal	725890927328374784	2016-04-29T03:34:18	PuruSaxenaWMgt time will tell, i'm not a screaming bull with blinders on either at this level...you know that but commodity trade helps too
alsabogal	725890584544727040	2016-04-29T03:32:56	PuruSaxenaWMgt yes, I'm just questioning how you could have so much conviction in bear case...seems more likely we break higher than lower
alsabogal	725890165919617024	2016-04-29T03:31:16	PuruSaxenaWMgt lol, i'm a glass half full kind of guy! I thought we'd get a p/b at 2050, then 2100...maybe this is it but jury still out
alsabogal	725889620462960640	2016-04-29T03:29:06	PuruSaxenaWMgt although from depressed levels, RUT has been outperforming SPX since Feb low
alsabogal	725888777474965508	2016-04-29T03:25:45	LMTentarelli got it...thx for answers! Energy does look very good!
alsabogal	725888391473172480	2016-04-29T03:24:13	PuruSaxenaWMgt divs are an extremely important part of overall returns!
alsabogal	725887154489032704	2016-04-29T03:19:18	LMTentarelli what do you use 10wk for?
alsabogal	725886769758097412	2016-04-29T03:17:46	PuruSaxenaWMgt a ton of resistance at 2100...will take time to break thru...odd that you're so bearish when we are so close to high
alsabogal	725886295998869504	2016-04-29T03:15:53	PuruSaxenaWMgt we've rallied 15% in under 3 months...takes time...a few more % % we'd be at ATH's...and total return wise we did make NH
alsabogal	725880751527485440	2016-04-29T02:53:52	LMTentarelli is trigger px breaking thru 40wk MA? Would exit be a break? How do you incorporate the 10wk? Looks like not a cross trigger

alsabogal	684905623297851392	2016-01-07T01:13:20	ByrneRWS crazy how bearish people have become...i'm not that bullish but the lopsided bearishness makes me think we bounce soon.

alsabogal	684852844432855040	2016-01-06T21:43:36	takingstock614 based on bearishness of stream you would think we are headed for -30% year!
alsabogal	684844937796517888	2016-01-06T21:12:11	In any case, the mood certainly is getting quite sour and MAX PAIN trade is to suck in bears then rip it.
alsabogal	684836726083170304	2016-01-06T20:39:33	To sum it up: tape is broken, bias is with the bears, but strong argument for covering/not pushing short into these levels short-term
alsabogal	684793328097951744	2016-01-06T17:47:06	Calculatorci me too...i'm cautiously optimistic we won't be down 20% this year  :)
