davidsirota	723984616256737280	2016-04-23T21:19:18	JECarter4 hard to say. But those were the rise of Coehlo/DLC. Not everything is presidential.
davidsirota	723984122171916288	2016-04-23T21:17:20	JECarter4 I think it became the party establishment's strategy after McGovern. I also think folks like Carter weren't the establishment
davidsirota	723983571896037376	2016-04-23T21:15:09	JECarter4 its a 140 character world in here
davidsirota	723983468279910402	2016-04-23T21:14:44	JECarter4 I guess I'd have the same positive spin if it was my relative.
davidsirota	723982811732959232	2016-04-23T21:12:07	JECarter4 those two points -- both of them -- are kinda indisputable.
davidsirota	723982581092352000	2016-04-23T21:11:12	JECarter4 bottom line: Carter is a great man. But the separate point holds: the corporatization of the party has been 40+ yrs in the making
davidsirota	723982028245479424	2016-04-23T21:09:01	JECarter4 "some blacks people said it was OK, so no biggie" -- come on, you're better than that garbage.
davidsirota	723981643715731456	2016-04-23T21:07:29	JECarter4 if that's your explanation for those ugly comments, that's pretty weak sauce.
davidsirota	723980777046700035	2016-04-23T21:04:02	JECarter4 not saying I fully agree with that, but it points out some significant indisputable facts.
davidsirota	723980334392434691	2016-04-23T21:02:17	JECarter4 also worth mentioning: 
davidsirota	723979721604620289	2016-04-23T20:59:51	JECarter4 maybe read some stuff about what happened after McGovern.
davidsirota	723979486404837376	2016-04-23T20:58:55	JECarter4 doesn't mean every single person in the party was that way. So get out of your own self-focused frame.
davidsirota	723979360059805696	2016-04-23T20:58:24	JECarter4 maybe try not to be so self-absorbed as to personalize it. The corp wing of the party was beginning its ascension after McGovern

davidsirota	723577252827435008	2016-04-22T18:20:35	But remember everyone...according to the same Cuomo aide, I'm "not an actual reporter"

davidsirota	723530756463566848	2016-04-22T15:15:49	BTW this is a taxpayer-paid govt employee of Cuomo now promoting the Clinton campaign attacks on me. Seems legit... 
davidsirota	723529906685005824	2016-04-22T15:12:26	Hey Cuomo spox melissadderosa: RT-ing a Clinton aide insulting me doesnt prove Cuomo originally backed $15 min wage

davidsirota	719279493320278016	2016-04-10T21:42:49	GlennKesslerWP also you spinning a vote to massively expand offshore drilling as a vote to protect Florida's coast was absolutely awesome
davidsirota	719279163366973440	2016-04-10T21:41:30	GlennKesslerWP you arguing principals have no responsibility for their top aides is the silliest thing that's been written in 2016.
davidsirota	719278308139999233	2016-04-10T21:38:06	Later today Im delegating my Twitter feed to my top aide. Per GlennKesslerWP, I'm therefore not responsible for anything said here. Thanks!
davidsirota	719277927901167616	2016-04-10T21:36:36	says dude who asserts in WashPost that a pol has no culpability for actions of her top aide. Got it, Mr. Impartial! 
davidsirota	719277091842166784	2016-04-10T21:33:16	Bush also delegated Iraq War decisions to Rumsfeld, so it's wrong to suggest Bush is responsible. Good point, bro.

davidsirota	719276003701485568	2016-04-10T21:28:57	By Kessler logic's, cuz Wash Post "delegated" stories to Janet Cooke, paper bore no responsibility.

davidsirota	705216750732771329	2016-03-03T02:22:30	jesseberney but you just extrapolated with no actual facts or vague substantiation. You’ll definitely get clicks — like Drudge. Congrats!
davidsirota	705216393495519233	2016-03-03T02:21:05	jesseberney could be you need to show good dem turnout/support in, you know, swing states to make the electability argument
davidsirota	705216120274309120	2016-03-03T02:20:00	jesseberney I dunno - but could simply be that her delegate lead is predicated (so far) on states that are not in contention in a general
davidsirota	705215500897296384	2016-03-03T02:17:32	Things I learned on Twitter: its now racist to note fact that Clinton’s delegate lead is from red states that wont be in play in the general
davidsirota	705214825186463744	2016-03-03T02:14:51	jesseberney the extrapolation you created is racist. But your desire to extrapolate, alas, is different from WHAT SHE ACTUALLY SAID
davidsirota	705214588535463936	2016-03-03T02:13:54	jesseberney 1) you said it was racist 2) it’s poitical - Clinton winning delegate lead mostly in states not up for grabs in the general

davidsirota	705213976154501122	2016-03-03T02:11:28	jesseberney so noting a fact about red states means she is discounting black people and racist. What an amazing extrapolation. Drudge-like.
davidsirota	705212973313183745	2016-03-03T02:07:29	jesseberney did she “discount” them? Or is that your hot take and did she simply state an irrefutable fact about a frontloaded schedule?

davidsirota	704072236873875456	2016-02-28T22:34:36	Mattison must be hard to come up with a logic where that feels righteous
davidsirota	704072161183424512	2016-02-28T22:34:18	Mattison and demanding the opponent of your agenda win over a steadfast supporter of that agenda. What an amazing calculation, really.

davidsirota	704071556201250817	2016-02-28T22:31:54	Mattison 1) nobody was surprised 2) very low voter turnout

davidsirota	704070367170564096	2016-02-28T22:27:11	Mattison then u oughta be worried about the polls showing Clinton doing worse than Bernie against GOP. But Im sure u have spin for that too

davidsirota	704069890227896320	2016-02-28T22:25:17	Mattison instead you abandon those who fought those opponents &amp; instead try to justify backing those who fought equal rights. Fascinating.
davidsirota	704069182107709440	2016-02-28T22:22:28	Mattison think we're done now. I'd suggest doing some reading. 
davidsirota	704068957922136064	2016-02-28T22:21:35	Mattison that's a nice but dishonest misdirect - she loudly and proudly pushed welfare reform, nafta etc.
davidsirota	704068685263040512	2016-02-28T22:20:30	Mattison and many believe cheerily standing with those who blocked progress against those who championed it is a politics of surrender.
davidsirota	704068481424052224	2016-02-28T22:19:41	Mattison yes change like throwing people off welfare, backing job killing trade deals and opposing gay rights. Facts too inconvenient, tho?
davidsirota	704068224183185408	2016-02-28T22:18:40	Mattison a politics of cheerily rewarding the obstacles to progress is a politics that should get used to never making real progress.
davidsirota	704067953067560962	2016-02-28T22:17:35	Mattison yes I recall that. And I recall only 3 years ago Hillary Clinton being against same sex marriage. But hey, the goldfish assumption

davidsirota	704066949802622976	2016-02-28T22:13:36	Mattison right I remember when Hillary said a white president and not MLK made civil rights happen. 
davidsirota	704066632818171905	2016-02-28T22:12:20	The assumption of modern politics seems to be that voters have the brains of goldfish &amp; thus forget their entire universe every 15 minutes
davidsirota	704066207515672577	2016-02-28T22:10:39	Mattison unless, of course, if the idea is that Americans are goldfish who forget their entire universe every 15 minutes.
davidsirota	704066033552723970	2016-02-28T22:09:57	Mattison I'm interested to understand how electing the candidate of "super predators" &amp; welfare reform &amp; mass incarceration bends anything.
davidsirota	704063683316428800	2016-02-28T22:00:37	Mattison interesting comment about a country started by the Revolutionary War, and featuring heroes like MLK etc
