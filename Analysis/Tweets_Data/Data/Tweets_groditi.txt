groditi	720417219625156608	2016-04-14T01:03:44	pcdunham as you can see in example the advantage is that it makes date math much easier
groditi	720416529116848131	2016-04-14T01:00:59	pcdunham eg if B=YEAR(An)*100+WEEKNUM(An) and you need to lookback 1 year you can match MATCH(An-100,B:B)  where n is current row

groditi	720413415596892161	2016-04-14T00:48:37	pcdunham yes, but don't concatenate, use (year*100)+weeknum to get an integer back. Concatenate will not zero pad single digit week nums
groditi	720410158057172992	2016-04-14T00:35:40	pcdunham using that combo you can generate key values that embed all necessary info like 20161301. Superior to strings bc ints are sortable
groditi	720409481067126784	2016-04-14T00:32:59	pcdunham that's best for weekly or semi weekly data. If you're comparing daily data with weekday patterns extend with weekday()
groditi	720409131870388225	2016-04-14T00:31:36	pcdunham you prob want weeknum(). Which you can use to turn a date into a year week hybrid using year(date)*100 + weeknum(date)

groditi	717435423837065223	2016-04-05T19:35:09	groditi first came customer acquisition costs, then came driver acquisition costs, next car acq costs? Might as well paint them yellow.
groditi	717435596986142721	2016-04-05T19:35:50	so to recover that $500 you need the drivers that stay to generate $21k in billings each for a 1y cost recovery period
groditi	717435102167322624	2016-04-05T19:33:52	We know Uber's driver parner 1st year loss rate is ~45%. Assuming linear decline, 22% is good-enough for decay rate 
groditi	717434158507659264	2016-04-05T19:30:07	so mp=3%=(100% - 95% - 2%). assume a non-zero x rate of new recruit decay rate. your cost recovery function would be ($500/(1-x))/mp
groditi	717432868528529408	2016-04-05T19:24:59	let's assume a lower boundary of ~2% of billings as marginal cost. that's probably mostly composed of cc fees, chargebacks, customer support

groditi	693183615715250176	2016-01-29T21:27:07	JakeCahan look at their press releases for earnings announcements. they have unparallelled disclosure and transparency. good ppl bad price
groditi	693183371497738242	2016-01-29T21:26:09	JakeCahan more real risk (happening right now) is that competitors underwritting badly wreck margins for the whole industry til they're out
groditi	693182980240465920	2016-01-29T21:24:35	JakeCahan consumer reviews look the same for all nonprime lenders. its an ugly business line but its a necessary one
groditi	693181380428038144	2016-01-29T21:18:14	JakeCahan thing is the sloppy underwritting is pretty much going to kill competition if/when cycle turns. pricing power very very cyclical
groditi	693180853065658368	2016-01-29T21:16:08	JakeCahan yeah that's my concern, because the income stream has such a short WAL that topline can easily halve in like 12 months
groditi	693180520809652225	2016-01-29T21:14:49	JakeCahan those are going to become a CFPB issue at some point
groditi	693179588252299264	2016-01-29T21:11:07	JakeCahan it's just like mtg servicing for dq loans. tons and tons of call center type labor. dunno where margin goes except def lower
groditi	693179375013892096	2016-01-29T21:10:16	JakeCahan i think for the whole space there's too much focus on basis point moves in NCOs when ppl should be watching servicing expenses
groditi	693179178921791488	2016-01-29T21:09:29	JakeCahan but i think the business can survive in it's current incarnation. you gotta remember nonprime lending is very high-touch service
groditi	693178904169705473	2016-01-29T21:08:24	JakeCahan margins hi right now, should compress. ~2y WAL assets we're not going back to 2009-2010 APRs or to 2012 NCO rates anytime soon
groditi	693152159249014785	2016-01-29T19:22:07	Stumbled upon some gold while digging through nytimes archives.. Did it shape up being this way? Eh... Not so much. 
groditi	693171397485420544	2016-01-29T20:38:34	JakeCahan so like for me i would think the valuation model is closer to say a mortgage servicer than a bank or ABS-funded nonbank lender
groditi	693171099010347008	2016-01-29T20:37:23	JakeCahan biz run very well by highly capable people but the price is way too high for someone doing things the CFPB is going after
groditi	693170856625700866	2016-01-29T20:36:25	JakeCahan because that fee can halt very quickly if consumers pay off or refi or default. their underwritting model is amazing tho
groditi	693170634130522112	2016-01-29T20:35:32	JakeCahan i think you need to look at it from an earnings basis on stable volumees and transition fee and then shock it

groditi	692204857139265538	2016-01-27T04:37:53	Nonrelatedsense adoxen I think we need an (unknown) net minimum of active to maximize agg returns. Mkt is testing that boundary now
groditi	692204630768537602	2016-01-27T04:36:59	Nonrelatedsense adoxen are we talking about aggregate returns or index returns, that matters and also is limited by price discovery

groditi	692202626797191168	2016-01-27T04:29:01	Nonrelatedsense adoxen only if active dopes are the ones causing the mispricing, passive is not a cause, just an amplifier of conditions

groditi	692201298570125316	2016-01-27T04:23:44	Nonrelatedsense adoxen closet indexers will likely disappear as they lose flows to lower cost comps

groditi	692200844025004032	2016-01-27T04:21:56	adoxen Nonrelatedsense passive flows should exacerbate (if any) valuation anomalies leading for wider spreads in any active opportunities
