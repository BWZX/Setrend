RudyHavenstein	717018811128352768	2016-04-04T15:59:40	spz_trader The debt situation is even worse now. It's just shifted from housing to other areas - auto, student, sovereign, corporate etc.
RudyHavenstein	717018510631632897	2016-04-04T15:58:29	spz_trader Fed could've shut down the nonsense in 5 minutes. At best, They were asleep at the switch.

RudyHavenstein	717017873114275840	2016-04-04T15:55:57	spz_trader The Fed created the mess of 2008.
RudyHavenstein	717017771293315072	2016-04-04T15:55:32	spz_trader You read support for Trump into my tweet? Bizarre. You should read contempt for most academic economists.

RudyHavenstein	717017226780381184	2016-04-04T15:53:23	spz_trader Yes. The Hubris level seems even higher now. Fed will save us (and bad accounting).
RudyHavenstein	717016967199100928	2016-04-04T15:52:21	.spz_trader I'm not referencing Trump. I'm referencing the pointlessness of asking Economists questions about the Economy.

RudyHavenstein	716894810582351872	2016-04-04T07:46:56	ok, I had a good night at online poker and a frustrating night at solving foreign policy. Why is Putin bad for killing jihadis?? confused
RudyHavenstein	716894524237152257	2016-04-04T07:45:48	pcdillard OK, well, the US should give up on the Saudi Wahabi terrorist incubator-funders imho. That'd be a good start.
RudyHavenstein	716894242673561600	2016-04-04T07:44:41	SongMun67 All I'm saying is that Russia is, at the moment, killing more terrorists than the US is supporting. I think that's a good thing.
RudyHavenstein	716893999231926272	2016-04-04T07:43:43	pcdillard I think the US has no clue what they're trying to do. They have created a disaster in the mideast (or made it worse)
RudyHavenstein	716893840376856577	2016-04-04T07:43:05	SongMun67 At least Putin is not holding hands with, kissing, and bowing to the Saudis like last few American Presidents.

RudyHavenstein	716892726659133440	2016-04-04T07:38:39	Why's it so hard to admit that Putin has been killing bad guys in Syria? I'm not saying he should get the Nobel Peace Prize, like Barack.

RudyHavenstein	716891498520838144	2016-04-04T07:33:47	SongMun67 All I'm saying is Obama is incompetent and Putin is actually killing bad guys. I loathe Stalin but he did kill a lot of Nazi scum
RudyHavenstein	716891074040442881	2016-04-04T07:32:05	pcdillard Still not sure what we disagree on.
RudyHavenstein	716890382349389824	2016-04-04T07:29:20	pcdillard I think we agree here.
RudyHavenstein	716890280893358080	2016-04-04T07:28:56	pcdillard What are we arguing about? Russia should not be killing Wahabi scum?
