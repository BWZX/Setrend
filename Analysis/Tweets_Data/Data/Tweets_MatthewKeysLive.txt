MatthewKeysLive	720385327521800192	2016-04-13T22:57:00	MatthewKeysLive really sorry to hear about this. This is not what justice is supposed to be about.
MatthewKeysLive	720385742128590852	2016-04-13T22:58:39	So, the affluenza teen , who killed people, and MatthewKeysLive both got 2 years. Think about that.

MatthewKeysLive	720370255277592576	2016-04-13T21:57:07	I remember when I first met MatthewKeysLive. He told me he found my work inspiring. I *wish* I was doing stuff as cool as he was in 2011.

MatthewKeysLive	720377953109020672	2016-04-13T22:27:42	If MatthewKeysLive serves 2 years as deterrence what message does letting killer cops walk send? BlackLivesMatter 
MatthewKeysLive	720383590098407424	2016-04-13T22:50:06	In any case, the sentence is what it is. I’m innocent, and I hope that we can make some headway in the appeals process.
MatthewKeysLive	720383447542272000	2016-04-13T22:49:32	In retrospect, perhaps affluenza would have been a better defense than innocence.
