irin	705084792258359296	2016-03-02T17:38:08	Breyer asked about TX women who suffered because of lack of admitting priv/ASC. "Which were the women? On what page can I find their names?"
irin	705083727072927745	2016-03-02T17:33:55	RBG: "If it's all right for the women of El Paso, why is it not all right for the women in the rest of Texas?"
irin	705083585292685312	2016-03-02T17:33:21	TX pointed to clinics in NM for women in El Paso. "That's odd," RBG said, because those clinics don't have same requirements as TX imposed.
irin	705082786277945345	2016-03-02T17:30:10	theglipper briefly, during Texas's portion. RBG made sure to say that the denominator was the women for whom it was a burden.

irin	705079224240107520	2016-03-02T17:16:01	Sotomayor also asked if getting a non-abortion D&amp;C at a doctor's office is any riskier than an abortion. Toti: "Virtually identical."
irin	705078625679384576	2016-03-02T17:13:38	Sotomayor and Ginsburg both focused on the absurdity of law requiring taking 2 pills (medication abortion) in an advanced surgical facility.

irin	705068379325992960	2016-03-02T16:32:55	RBG and Sotomayor fought very hard to show that abortion is safe and that women would be put at greater risk under the laws.
