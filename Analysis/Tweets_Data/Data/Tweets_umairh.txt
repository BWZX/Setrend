umairh	720803983154089987	2016-04-15T02:40:36	the idea that leadership is "getting things done" vs doing the right things, wise things, great things, is why we keep doing dumb things.
umairh	720803250874802177	2016-04-15T02:37:41	so in that sense, i think it is the head of state's first job to set a moral vision, principles, that define a purpose. deal-making's easy.
umairh	720803059476140032	2016-04-15T02:36:55	i think leadership as deal-making is how we got into this mess. then nobody sets a moral vision, and it's welcome to the jungle.

umairh	716944379374657540	2016-04-04T11:03:54	5. I'm hardly Karl Marx, I'm just a dude. If the system is this broken even to me, it's really seriously and profoundly broken.
umairh	716944120305033216	2016-04-04T11:02:53	4. If we're unable to invest in education, healthcare, etc, if the middle's imploding, a major cause is looted states + hidden gains.
umairh	716943823017025536	2016-04-04T11:01:42	3. Those idle surpluses, so big we can't even count them, 25-50% of global GDP, should be invested in human potential. Public goods.
umairh	716943611603120128	2016-04-04T11:00:51	2. Today, as I've said before, idle surpluses have piled up through extralegal means like offshore finance. The economy is deeply broken.
umairh	716943446171365376	2016-04-04T11:00:12	1. Keynes designed a global economy precisely so that idle surpluses WOULDN'T pile up at the top, and produce inequality and stagnation.
umairh	716943244291080193	2016-04-04T10:59:24	Ah, hell. I'll do a few points on the panamapapers despite the sure hate it'll earn me.
umairh	716941016297775104	2016-04-04T10:50:33	Of the many ways capitalism's broken, 25-50% of global GDP looted and hidden while the global economy stagnates is one of the greatest.
umairh	716940301814874112	2016-04-04T10:47:42	You have to wonder about the "but they didn't break the law!!" crowd. Dictators, warlords, thugs hiding loot and plunder is OK? Please.
umairh	716939205063090176	2016-04-04T10:43:21	The point of offshore finance is to be above the law so you don't have to break it. But what does break as a result is the financial system.
umairh	716938624445583360	2016-04-04T10:41:02	Already, the flunkies are like "but it's not illegal!!!!" re the panamapapers. Nope, it's extralegal. Designed to make law irrelevant.

umairh	713786961518002177	2016-03-26T17:57:27	Think about it: the young literally have no future, no homes/careers/savings/retirements, while markets are begging govs to invest.
umairh	713786302056034304	2016-03-26T17:54:50	Just how absurd is this situation? A leadership and governance failure on a scale unseen since Great Depression.
umairh	713785909536243712	2016-03-26T17:53:16	If govs were investing heavily in health, ed, transport, more jobs, better lives, middle class renewal, less demagoguery.
umairh	713785576995102721	2016-03-26T17:51:57	This is the even bigger pic. Trump vs Hillary = rocket into abyss or more decline. Easy decision. But bad choices.

umairh	713784943822897156	2016-03-26T17:49:26	Sure. Trump the lil pic. Big one: negative rates, stagnation, decline, gov not investing in future. Crazy.

umairh	713784122649550850	2016-03-26T17:46:10	Frankly, the rise of demagoguery is pretty inevitable once people r trapped in decline. There are many trumps waiting in the wings.

umairh	711205799218061312	2016-03-19T15:00:50	So to me the big question is, if the world can't go forward, can the transition back to feudalism at least happen peacefully?
umairh	711205538231689218	2016-03-19T14:59:48	Maybe the truth is humans can't handle freedom. Feudalism is the best we can hope for. I don't know, but that's where we're heading.

umairh	711204665367646209	2016-03-19T14:56:20	But the truth is its not just the U.S. that's declining, the global liberal order is. Who's gonna put it back together? My bet is no one.
umairh	711204119155970048	2016-03-19T14:54:10	Maybe that's why we bury ourselves in superhero movies and Internet rage and reality TV. Decline is perma trauma.
umairh	711203624454660101	2016-03-19T14:52:12	Yeah. I mean we've got the decline checklist down. Demagogues, imploding middle, Caligulan elites. Not a drill.

umairh	710922730674262016	2016-03-18T20:16:01	Kiwigirl58 nobody's saying it does. you're saying the opposite: happiness is irrelevant. think clearly.
umairh	710921924050817024	2016-03-18T20:12:49	for example, internet leftism is hardcore marxist materialist. that's why it's limited to redistribution, subjectivism, etc.

umairh	710171329044090880	2016-03-16T18:30:13	Great job, guys! 
umairh	710158343357255680	2016-03-16T17:38:37	You guys are so paranoid. So what if trump wants to replace the cabinet with trump? Maybe he is the only advisor he needs. Democracy, hello.
umairh	710157620070453249	2016-03-16T17:35:45	LOL I know you guys are saturated but this...

umairh	710156540620234752	2016-03-16T17:31:28	I wish I could join this club but I'm in the other one 😯😎 
umairh	710156274332254213	2016-03-16T17:30:24	gandalfstaff that's good karma. Purity of intention 👍👍😎😎🎈🎈
umairh	710156042647293952	2016-03-16T17:29:29	Crazy is in a way energy we can't really handle, manage, process. Hence...this.  
umairh	710155472079343616	2016-03-16T17:27:13	But we can save the metaphysical debate, I know you guys are die hard materialists and struggle to admit the possibility of immaterial logic
umairh	710155207544606722	2016-03-16T17:26:10	I'd say terrible people they look like they're spending their lives enraged, bitter, angry, not happy, fulfilled, purposive. That's karma.
umairh	710154876869812224	2016-03-16T17:24:51	Yup. Karma is just what we reap in our souls from the intentions in our hearts. Do these terrible people look happy? 
umairh	710153308393054212	2016-03-16T17:18:37	I think we've reached that juncture in history where the best among us aren't nearly good enough to stop the bad from much worse.
umairh	710152804279689216	2016-03-16T17:16:37	Yup. Ironically, the only actor that can end stagnation and decline is the state.

umairh	710137953243291648	2016-03-16T16:17:36	Like I say in my new book, trump's a product of failed leadership. And that's the real issue.

umairh	710136847683477506	2016-03-16T16:13:12	Better to say: this budget is bad economics, and explain why. People get it. So say it!

umairh	709919725715918848	2016-03-16T01:50:26	miishke in the us it never really seems to change much, that's for sure
umairh	709919595092639744	2016-03-16T01:49:55	Seanismoney yup, sadly the upside is now that that doesn't degenerate into something worse
umairh	709919463118872576	2016-03-16T01:49:24	sorry man, but i have a feeling it's dubious. remember how everyone wrote off trump six months ago? like that. 
umairh	709917757740077058	2016-03-16T01:42:37	i'm really glad i don't have kids because there's no way i'd be able to explain how 5000 years of civilization ended with this election.
umairh	709916734904516608	2016-03-16T01:38:33	AC_Bravo yup. people get REALLY freaked out whenever i discuss it tho, so i stopped.
umairh	709916580742877184	2016-03-16T01:37:57	vmtyler nope but i will now!
umairh	709915926498549760	2016-03-16T01:35:21	pretty grim stuff. hey, cheer up umair, at least we're not denmark. david brooks says they're totally not dynamic. like super america.
umairh	709915722906996737	2016-03-16T01:34:32	since the upside is nothing changes, i do wonder how the US can take another decade of this kind of stagnation. young destroyed, middle gone
umairh	709914550049619968	2016-03-16T01:29:52	yup. the US's chances to join the rest of the advanced world (public college, healthcare, etc) just went poof. 
umairh	709911800582676480	2016-03-16T01:18:57	So the upside of the Hillary/Trump election will be that nothing will change, the downside will be Caligulan decline. Awwwesome.
umairh	709905721140363265	2016-03-16T00:54:47	hillary vs trump is gonna be like...you guys do this...i need to go pack a toothbrush and some nice sheets for the internment camps

umairh	709783882049183744	2016-03-15T16:50:39	Ending free trade will worsen stagnation, by raising prices and killing jobs. The real challenge is balancing trade gains so it's equitable.
umairh	709783571209265153	2016-03-15T16:49:25	So don't be ideologues. See the nuance (god I hate that word). Free trade does have huge benefits, but they're distributed unfairly.
umairh	709783257517264896	2016-03-15T16:48:10	Do trade agreement have to be rewritten more equitably? Yes. Should the globe abandon free trade? No. That's the big danger.
umairh	709783067506900994	2016-03-15T16:47:25	The backlash against free trade is global and widespread. Not fringe leftism anymore, mass politics in US, UK, EU.
umairh	709782872664764417	2016-03-15T16:46:38	Ironically, free trade extremists caused a backlash in once diehard support for it by equating it with trade that benefits the richest.

umairh	709404458774614016	2016-03-14T15:42:57	Let's try this another way. What would it take for you (or pundits) to call this fascism?
umairh	709401617288790016	2016-03-14T15:31:40	Nobody. One big reason I don't think the U.S. is fixable now. We cant even call fascism what it is, why protest? 
umairh	709397546507046912	2016-03-14T15:15:29	It's failure upon failure. Failure to govern, failure to report and police that failure, and now to accurately describe what rises from it.
umairh	709397227056316416	2016-03-14T15:14:13	Long story short, pundits spent the last decade pretending the middle class was A-OK, this one that fascism isn't really happening here.
umairh	709393871101435906	2016-03-14T15:00:53	I'm gonna stop discussing it for a while, I think Trump alone isn't the issue but rather the system that's propelling him to power.
umairh	709393431198572544	2016-03-14T14:59:08	What's even more astonishing than fascism rising is the media's complicity in it, with equivocation, minimisation, rationalisation.

umairh	709047700084428801	2016-03-13T16:05:19	Do a thought test. If trump called for his supporters to rampage on Mexican and Muslim businesses, would they? So what does that make this?
umairh	709047395955437568	2016-03-13T16:04:07	The idea that this isn't fascism panders to our egos. But the simple fact is there is no other explanation that fits as well.
umairh	709047175209156609	2016-03-13T16:03:14	Authoritarianism is a psych tendency. Nationalism doesn't call for ethnic cleansing. Fascism is a strategy, ideology, mode of organisation.

umairh	707939632302956544	2016-03-10T14:42:15	LOL nobody knows where nativism came from. And that's how pundits construct artificial realities.
umairh	707910779698216960	2016-03-10T12:47:36	Help me identify the racist Trump supporter who repeatedly punched this protestor in the face last night.  CRIMINAL! 
umairh	707935577144999937	2016-03-10T14:26:09	Indeed. One of the many reasons nativism's trivially inaccurate is that whites aren't natives. It's shallow spin.  
umairh	707933992016814081	2016-03-10T14:19:51	I want you guys to think about stuff like this. Why do pundits replace concepts with depth and rigor like fascism with spin like nativism?
umairh	707932588044853248	2016-03-10T14:14:16	Let me put that another way. "Nativism" is a fiction, a buzzword. Fascism, nationalism, have decades of research, thought, etc, behind them.
umairh	707932194833043457	2016-03-10T14:12:42	Possibly. All I know is suddenly ALL the pundits started saying it, to avoid the F word. So where'd it come from?  
umairh	707931916339712000	2016-03-10T14:11:36	jamesdillard but they weren't doing hitler salutes to a billionaire ego demonises minorities...think clearly don't buy the bs
umairh	707931315652395008	2016-03-10T14:09:13	If trump's movement was led by a poor white or heaven forbid a minority, it'd be "fascism" in a heartbeat, not "nativism".
umairh	707931022592221184	2016-03-10T14:08:03	There's a lot desperate reality denial going on in the establishment, but replacing "fascism" with "nativism" has to be the peak.
umairh	707930828823724032	2016-03-10T14:07:16	Where is "nativism" as a term, a genteel establishment way of avoiding saying nationalism, fascism, etc, coming from? Which pundit?
umairh	707930379861282816	2016-03-10T14:05:29	Welcome to the future  
umairh	707928772478160896	2016-03-10T13:59:06	The Washington Post ran 16 negative stories about Bernie Sanders in 16 hours.

umairh	707777976440639488	2016-03-10T03:59:54	try not to fuck it up. you're probably not going to get another one. i mean when i was 18 the idea of a socialist at prez debate...LOL
umairh	707777841664888832	2016-03-10T03:59:21	ok let me just say it. bernie is the one candidate with a sane grip on the real issues. its up to young ppl now. *this is your chance*.
umairh	707777387044446208	2016-03-10T03:57:33	future historians are gonna study bernie's concluding remarks and weep.
umairh	707775316031361025	2016-03-10T03:49:19	bernie says "capitalist" with a snarl like i imagine vampire karl marx would. i love it

umairh	707771155034316800	2016-03-10T03:32:47	fischpack partially true, but no good reason for such a big diff except uncompetitive market
umairh	707770342488608768	2016-03-10T03:29:34	GerritMC please, lets not with the lectures. i'm just sharing my thoughts.
umairh	707769641523920897	2016-03-10T03:26:46	the trump hillary debates are going to be some of the strangest and most tragicomic spectacles in modern political history.
umairh	707768546928017408	2016-03-10T03:22:25	student debt 10% while rates are negative is actually the biggest scam in the economy today. it's like a triple whammy. crazy.
umairh	707766632563736576	2016-03-10T03:14:49	wampusmm it's not a ring, and we're not spectators. it's a society, and they're there to serve us. we're judges, citizens, not fans.
umairh	707766340032065536	2016-03-10T03:13:39	chupacabrito yup, it's a classic rhetorical sleight of hand. but up against a trump a necessary one
umairh	707765856068091904	2016-03-10T03:11:44	i'll shut up now, watching debates in the middle of the night in london makes me do stupid things like eating giant bowls of pasta at 3am
umairh	707765780595810305	2016-03-10T03:11:26	truth is the first casualty of democracy 
umairh	707765646277345280	2016-03-10T03:10:54	see? everybody's tweeting the "i'm not a natural politician" line. turned a weakness into a strength. killer line. character, not policy.
umairh	707765427347316737	2016-03-10T03:10:02	my takeaway so far is hillary's WAY better off script than on script. on script hillary gets crushed by trump. off script hillary maybe not.
umairh	707763922389098497	2016-03-10T03:04:03	this is what marco rubio feels like tonight 
umairh	707763506456748032	2016-03-10T03:02:24	"i am dangerous", now thats what the people want in an age of rage. danger, menace, threat. good line from bernie.
umairh	707762569663156224	2016-03-10T02:58:40	davidmkim tooootally
umairh	707762461353463808	2016-03-10T02:58:15	Then she should be saying it every thirty seconds, it's her make America great  
umairh	707761826373750784	2016-03-10T02:55:43	hillary's getting *terrrible* advice. the "i'm not a natural politician" that slipped out is the best thing she's said all year. killer line
umairh	707761385669791744	2016-03-10T02:53:58	KevinReuning that's very true, sharply said
umairh	707761184385212417	2016-03-10T02:53:10	gmukunda EmanuelDerman true. still, i think this election is about painting a portrait of a dream, not just micro-policy. transformational
umairh	707760968420425728	2016-03-10T02:52:19	when hillary gets a question she really cares about, she emotes like trump, empathic + genuine. but when she doesn't, she doesn't. the diff.
umairh	707760236086566912	2016-03-10T02:49:24	wow that question was horribly tragic if you understood the spanish.
umairh	707759788520775680	2016-03-10T02:47:37	trump will eat hillary alive on stage. her micro policy responses will get utterly destroyed by his endless make america greats.

umairh	707758116096634881	2016-03-10T02:40:59	you know the left is down with bernie b/c they don't even lecture him about real slavery and appropriating the term
umairh	707757921757745152	2016-03-10T02:40:12	this is a well moderated debate. but this is also quite a boring debate.
umairh	707757711820251136	2016-03-10T02:39:22	this is actually the sickest burn in internet history 
umairh	707757541867044864	2016-03-10T02:38:42	the suit is blue on the live feed, brown on the broadcast. there are two bernies.
umairh	707757109996351488	2016-03-10T02:36:59	the problem with focusing on peripheral culture war issues is they don't motivate ppl enough to vote. just to vent. 
umairh	707756485233799169	2016-03-10T02:34:30	the endless baby tantrums thinly veiled white supremacists are gonna convulse into tomorrow about the spanish in this debate
umairh	707755848722939905	2016-03-10T02:31:58	i think one of the things the unelection of bernie will do is shake up the left. better priorities. less culture war, more real issues.
umairh	707755321423478786	2016-03-10T02:29:52	pretty incredible that we're seeing low-wage labour described as slavery (not, you know, the wages of laziness) in a us presidential debate.
umairh	707754068115116032	2016-03-10T02:24:53	tl;dr the unelection of bernie sanders is the end of millennials summer of love.
umairh	707753924334395394	2016-03-10T02:24:19	ironically, the unelection of bernie might be the one thing that DOES galvanize youngs to spark a revolution. or turn them cynical for life
umairh	707753794583576576	2016-03-10T02:23:48	bernie's killin it. you can almost believe he is leading a revolution tonight.

umairh	707733039091212288	2016-03-10T01:01:20	you can see it everywhere. culture has taken such a hard left shift its staggering. lately all i see is appropriation, trigger warning, etc
umairh	707731874974715904	2016-03-10T00:56:42	the hard shift to pretty hardcore socialism among the young is a pretty remarkable thing. yes, i get the causes, etc.
umairh	707731605310210048	2016-03-10T00:55:38	poor leadership. rest of advanced world middle class doing much better. implosion was a choice in the us. 
umairh	707728456163917824	2016-03-10T00:43:07	yup. this election is more about transformational change vs incremental change than orthodox left/right.

umairh	706870319236161537	2016-03-07T15:53:11	Nothing. Why should the gov care about decline if the ppl don't?  
umairh	706870074628562944	2016-03-07T15:52:13	I disagree. I think we get something like a feudal caste society where your clan is your destiny.

umairh	706867973068349440	2016-03-07T15:43:52	The 90s were a time of romantic despair. The 2010s are one of nihilistic resignation. Hence the nostalgia. At least we felt something then
umairh	706864937373724672	2016-03-07T15:31:48	None of this stuff is complicated, I think we overcomplicate it. Just as we overcomplicate life, love, ourselves.
umairh	706864669395386368	2016-03-07T15:30:44	I think maybe we try too hard to find nuance these days. Some things really r simple. Trump's a fascist. Youngs should vote. This is decline

umairh	706863044408840192	2016-03-07T15:24:17	Lemme try and put that another way. If every young person voted for the candidate they like most, they and society would be better off fast

umairh	706150663231827969	2016-03-05T16:13:32	The punditocracy obsessing over trump's electability instead of the real issues beneath it is the most tedious thing since Kanye's fashion
umairh	706149091588370432	2016-03-05T16:07:17	StellaTex true progress is not cynically writing off billions of lives improved because the world isn't perfect. Think clearly.
umairh	706148894003097600	2016-03-05T16:06:30	StellaTex it's poor thinking. we can admit there are softer harms even in peace and call to mitigate them. That's true progress.
umairh	706148633801056256	2016-03-05T16:05:28	StellaTex I've written several books about exactly that, right? So yes! But. Don't make the leftist mistake of writing off peace.

umairh	706116219104006144	2016-03-05T13:56:40	Exactly. Elite rhetoric of recovery while reality is mega stagnation is the fundamental driver of demagoguery.

umairh	706107457463062528	2016-03-05T13:21:51	I get it. Mediocre rich white straight guys are terrified of Trump because he treats them like they've treated everyone else since forever.

umairh	705598071741218816	2016-03-04T03:37:44	The really jarring thing is that trump is the least extreme but most authoritarian and nationalist.

umairh	705592964664393728	2016-03-04T03:17:26	Cruz is literally begging for votes. Rubio's whining for them. Trump is bashing their heads in for both. It's like the Three Stooges.
umairh	705590764508729344	2016-03-04T03:08:42	Trump could eat a kitten on stage + still win. He's the only one to acknowledge how the imploded middle feels, betrayed and embittered.
umairh	705589803333640192	2016-03-04T03:04:52	The GOP really doesn't get people respond to Trump's perceived character as a savior. Policy attacks won't work, they'll only reinforce it.

umairh	705580187791007744	2016-03-04T02:26:40	Cruz has the right approach, attacking Trump's character. Unfortunately, he can't deliver the attack credibly. He's got even LESS character.

umairh	705430801060651008	2016-03-03T16:33:03	Sorry, as a disabled person I so disagree with this, and being rude to be heard. Inclusion isn't objectification.

umairh	705426163867525121	2016-03-03T16:14:38	The "we reject Trump cos he's a fanatical bigot" line is WHY the GOP has no cred with anyone. Half want that, half are like uh you are too.
umairh	705423252936658944	2016-03-03T16:03:04	See what I mean? This is a reputational battle insiders have no idea how to fight, no wonder trump's loving it. 
umairh	705422016694845441	2016-03-03T15:58:09	You laugh now, but after eight years of Trump, we're all going to be making the Chris Christie face.
umairh	705421734552408064	2016-03-03T15:57:02	Not gonna work. Fundamental issue here trust. Trump's more trusted. Backfire from attacker who's not.

umairh	705420125567119361	2016-03-03T15:50:38	AnandWrites disagree. You're being way too kind to current leaders. Failure on every real level created room for demagogues.
umairh	705419431107817473	2016-03-03T15:47:53	See how easy this is? The GOP really doesn't have a clue how to play this game. Ironically, it's out bullied. 
umairh	705418616108355584	2016-03-03T15:44:38	Interesting. True. My guess, they're too busy shouting at one another digitally to accomplish anything now.

umairh	704866184030769152	2016-03-02T03:09:28	I can’t put my finger on what it is but there’s something different about Christie tonight.

umairh	704867126616702976	2016-03-02T03:13:13	yes, that press conf was staged to appeal to authoritarians. that's exactly the pt. trump's too good at propaganda. v hard to beat.
umairh	704866865861009408	2016-03-02T03:12:11	well. that's pretty much it people. either youngs vote en masse. or say hello to a new age of ultra militant nationalism. to put it kindly.

umairh	704864746219151360	2016-03-02T03:03:45	This spectacle...Christie standing at attention worshipfully before "Mr" Trump... the birth of fascism live on stage.

umairh	704862773709291520	2016-03-02T02:55:55	The Reeducation of Chris Christie is the single most chilling thing I've seen in modern politics. And the election's barely begun.

umairh	704859901743521792	2016-03-02T02:44:30	This Trump Christie dynamic is the weirdest political pyschodrama I've *ever* seen. It's straight Fifty Shades of Trump.

umairh	704858919475273728	2016-03-02T02:40:36	Wow, this is freaking me out. Look at how Christie's looking at Trump! Like he's been re-educated, dominated, totally broken. WTF.
umairh	704858708073947136	2016-03-02T02:39:46	“Mr. Trump”  “Chris."
umairh	704858616164126720	2016-03-02T02:39:24	i have never seen anyone in modern politics look as utterly broken and beaten as christie does right now. THAT'S why Trumpists love Trump.
umairh	704858336416628736	2016-03-02T02:38:17	man, christie looks like alex from a clockwork orange after he got brutally re-educated.
umairh	704857812673888256	2016-03-02T02:36:12	jdvaldez2 that's the real point. i mean despite all the analysis and commentary, the fact is the rise was totally unforeseen.
umairh	704857666196258816	2016-03-02T02:35:37	what do we learn from rubio? the low road doesn't work against a demagogue. it helps them. hence, attacking trump doesn't work.
umairh	704856984080752641	2016-03-02T02:32:55	jdvaldez2 don't think there's any defeating trump now short of tearing up the party.
umairh	704856337818124288	2016-03-02T02:30:21	its a sign of how disconnected insiders are from reality they thought rubio was a challenge for trump. he was disposed of in days.
umairh	704855053849509888	2016-03-02T02:25:15	johnrobb indeed. i'd say they're gonna tune out hard...v big hurdle for dems to overcome. maybe a necessary blow to suffer.
umairh	704853786091757568	2016-03-02T02:20:12	the prob the dems r gonna have now is youngs tuning out sans bernie, while the trumpist base goes into a frenzy. big challenge.
umairh	704851510178537476	2016-03-02T02:11:10	Hillary sounding truly presidential, reinvigorated, confident, for the 1st time tonight. Good. She's gonna need to to take on Trump.
umairh	704849624671100928	2016-03-02T02:03:40	Is Trump really changing the rules, or is he just better at playing the game?
umairh	704849595239698432	2016-03-02T02:03:33	JustinSnyderFL i'd say its sad but really its just wearisome at this point.

umairh	704848230899650561	2016-03-02T01:58:08	The striking thing about watching the rise of fascism to me is its utter banality. Arendt, Baudrillard, Agamben were right.

umairh	704697736793354240	2016-03-01T16:00:07	Like presumably THE foundational inalienable right IS citizenship. If it can be suspended, no basis for law, democracy, consent. Dark ages.
umairh	704696649663320064	2016-03-01T15:55:48	It's interesting. Repealing citizenship strikes at the heart of constitutionalism. Yet, no outcry from left or right 
umairh	704695698030247938	2016-03-01T15:52:01	oldapperdhru I don't see reality checking as condescension. If you do then you should ask why. Why do think I'm here to coddle you?
umairh	704695375039471616	2016-03-01T15:50:44	Actually it's far worse, it's antithetical to democracy and erosive of the rule of law. Real dark ages shit 
umairh	704694827074633728	2016-03-01T15:48:34	oldapperdhru yes, after a decade of calling for reform and predicting crisis  I'm acting.  BTW seeing hidden motives is narcissistic.

umairh	704683012773044225	2016-03-01T15:01:37	Instead of Hillary's "make America whole", she should say trump = "make America hate". A much tougher line.

umairh	702878524244361216	2016-02-25T15:31:13	The question now isn't can Trump win, it's can anyone stop him from winning.

umairh	701793093775974401	2016-02-22T15:38:06	Bingo. This leftism fights for fringe sexual subcultures but not public libraries. It's infantile, regressive.  
umairh	701792865945591808	2016-02-22T15:37:12	Yes. But the stakes are bigger. An expansive social contract grounded in basic rights, or an illiberal one.  
umairh	701787590983340032	2016-02-22T15:16:14	The first casualty of this age of extremism is going to be the great liberal institutions of the last century. By both left and right.
umairh	701786905105584128	2016-02-22T15:13:31	True. But understanding that breaking the EU is an epically terrible idea is high school econ. 
umairh	701786467438370816	2016-02-22T15:11:47	I REALLY don't get this brand of leftism. But it's a sign of how impotent it is that trumps rising, the eu breaking. 
umairh	701785727298838528	2016-02-22T15:08:50	Indeed. I don't know how often or how loudly I can say: "history's repeating itself". But my voice is small anyways. 
umairh	701785108353830913	2016-02-22T15:06:23	And extremists are ruining a century of progress by breaking the EU while the idiot spoilt brat left fights for...gender free bathrooms.
umairh	701784735345995776	2016-02-22T15:04:54	I really hate tweeting about econ but for fucks sake extremists are breaking the world's greatest political union while the medias like derp
umairh	701784444294852608	2016-02-22T15:03:44	Leaving the EU would raise prices, kill jobs, depress wages, raise rates, ruin the young further, amplify inequality. It's economic idiocy.
umairh	701783858065383426	2016-02-22T15:01:24	It's utterly incredible that extremists want the UK to leave the EU and not a single voice in media has pointed out how foolish it'd be.

umairh	700518427786522624	2016-02-19T03:13:02	for me hillary vs bernie is a dilemma. bernie's revolution is for the majority, hillary's incrementalism isn't, but won't fix much. meh.
umairh	700517609154809857	2016-02-19T03:09:47	why doesn't hillary offer a vision yet? this is exactly how jeb lost. she sounds like a technocrat, but people r looking for a leader.

umairh	697984628469190657	2016-02-12T03:24:38	the only thing i take away from the foreign policy sections of these debates is in fact no one has a clue what to do about isis.

umairh	697976066225414144	2016-02-12T02:50:36	bernie and hillary live in different realities. bernie sees a deep sweeping crisis, hillary sees pockets of despair in a functioning society
umairh	697975994649542656	2016-02-12T02:50:19	lol don't forget the first rule of US politics: just when you don't think it can get worse...it does. 
umairh	697973690571616256	2016-02-12T02:41:10	you'll hate me, but the more bernie can take on an apparatus that's not shy of throwing loaded questions at him the more i respect the dude.
umairh	697973478406950913	2016-02-12T02:40:19	you know these questions are a dream for hillary. "race relations better under a clinton administration". rhetoric like that matters.
umairh	697972326919495681	2016-02-12T02:35:45	😂😂 
umairh	697971081668358144	2016-02-12T02:30:48	wow did they just ask bernie if he was going to "thwart history"? wtf. these are some serious softball setups for hillary.
umairh	697970302668636162	2016-02-12T02:27:42	terrible, thoughtless questions, zero moderation, hillary's strategy is to create a war of attrition. really poor debate. worst one yet.
umairh	697968458626158592	2016-02-12T02:20:22	i don't know who's advising hillary but being a nitpicking wonk isn't being a visionary leader. it's just going to erode her even further.
umairh	697968088667590656	2016-02-12T02:18:54	lizbon oh please. if criticizing makes hillary makes me a sexist you need to take a breath and chill.
umairh	697967779627077637	2016-02-12T02:17:40	it's also gonna make for a really tedious debate. but the point is that nitpicking just reinforces hillary's lack of a unifying vision.
umairh	697967539410878466	2016-02-12T02:16:43	ok, so hillary's strategy is gonna be nitpick bernie to death. not gonna work w/o a vision of hillary's own.
umairh	697966996802183168	2016-02-12T02:14:34	ugh i can't deal with hillary being such a politician. she even adjusts her tone to what she thinks people wanna hear.
umairh	697966875175731201	2016-02-12T02:14:05	what a terrible question. what does the "size" of government even mean? let's hope the questions are better than this.

umairh	697254399685619713	2016-02-10T03:02:57	Last thing I'll note. Trump frame = "winning against world". Bernie frame = "catching up to world". Key difference going forward.
umairh	697254099562188800	2016-02-10T03:01:46	nb, i'm not a bernie supporter/endorser. you can see his own establishment already forming, and it's got its own problems. just discussing.
umairh	697253425990541312	2016-02-10T02:59:05	Listening to Trump after Bernie is like listening to an infomercial for legal highs after reading a great book.

umairh	697249848274325507	2016-02-10T02:44:52	I say it every time, I'll say it again. Bernie's platform isn't radical, it's that the US do what the advanced world did decades ago.
umairh	697249560264105985	2016-02-10T02:43:44	You can see why young people everywhere are like 1000% for Bernie. He's really the only one giving them a shot at anything beyond fuckage.

umairh	697243556986101761	2016-02-10T02:19:52	I think that search for "strength", credibility to buck a broken system, is defining this election. Hillary + Jeb ignore at their peril.
umairh	697243048749723650	2016-02-10T02:17:51	People want "strong" leaders, for better or worse, in an age of anxiety. Not Rubio's gaffes, Hillary's vagueness, Jeb's caution.
umairh	697242952444329984	2016-02-10T02:17:28	Yup. This is weak messaging. Too vague. It's just not gonna work, especially against Bernie's crystal clear message. 
umairh	697241606148247552	2016-02-10T02:12:07	If these results keep holding, this election's going to be a free for all. Establishment fighting extremes fighting each other fighting...

umairh	697232888144728068	2016-02-10T01:37:29	The choice between Trump's dynastic socialism for the .01% or Sanders' social-democracy-lite for everyone else is a pretty easy one.

umairh	697115750780248068	2016-02-09T17:52:01	This election is a referendum on precisely that. The American Dream, whether to cling to, ration out, yesterday's, or imagine tomorrow's.
umairh	697115373645201408	2016-02-09T17:50:31	Team Hillary's angry, worried. But the problem's pretty simple. No compelling, resonant vision for a new American Dream.

umairh	696164522315407361	2016-02-07T02:52:10	So whatever this is, conservatism isn't the right word for it. I'd call it extremism, fundamentalism, blind ideology.

umairh	696162865330446336	2016-02-07T02:45:35	The GOP debates have gone from bizarre to delusional to tragicomic to sheer lunacy. I can't believe this level of crazy is happening.

umairh	695451667576164352	2016-02-05T03:39:33	No doubt the fact that you can totally see yourself getting baked with Bernie doesn't hurt his cred with the youngs.

umairh	695444437061611525	2016-02-05T03:10:49	hillary sounds like an expert secretary of state. the question is whether that, or bernie's revolution, is a vision for the country.
umairh	695443957426196481	2016-02-05T03:08:54	scripterson yeah thats true. being prez would finish the poor guy off. hell it'd finish me off!!

umairh	695442656655122432	2016-02-05T03:03:44	Bernie kills Hillary on econ policy. Hillary edges Bernie on foreign policy. In a way the choice is a referendum on which matters more to us

umairh	695441540978638848	2016-02-05T02:59:18	Now that's a biggie. Part of the reason I'm skeptical Bernie can pull it off. But at this point who knows! 
umairh	695440965306155009	2016-02-05T02:57:01	But really. I'm just happy we're watching a debate that's about actual issues in 2016, not ones from the middle ages.
umairh	695440648334258176	2016-02-05T02:55:45	Hillary, otoh, I think is getting some terrible advice on media and strategy. The smear line left her both weaker and more vulnerable.
umairh	695440423368544256	2016-02-05T02:54:52	Bernie's coming into his own as a transformative leader. It's a remarkable thing to watch. I'm skeptical, but maybe he'll pull it off.

umairh	695439280349446144	2016-02-05T02:50:19	listening to hillary in this financial section of the debate is almost painful. it's like we're not on the same planet.
umairh	695439047045459972	2016-02-05T02:49:24	wow. "the business model of wall st is fraud". that's why youngs respond to bernie. not spin, reality.
umairh	695438764097667073	2016-02-05T02:48:16	krtmurray that's not a serious analysis, that's just advocacy
umairh	695438350606413824	2016-02-05T02:46:38	hillary's defending *not* breaking up banks with a bureaucratic defense of systemic risk. that's...i don't...what the.
umairh	695437316605607936	2016-02-05T02:42:31	man bernie's laying it down like a sermon tonight. wow.
umairh	695436914053132289	2016-02-05T02:40:55	"i spoke to wall st before the crash" is a weak defense. more to the point, it's a defense. taking more and more of hillary's time.

umairh	695435710497558528	2016-02-05T02:36:08	i'd be surprised if hillary picks up any support among youngs by attacking bernie. the reason they &lt;3 bernie is he tells it like it is.
umairh	695434239609712640	2016-02-05T02:30:17	hillary's losing this debate hard. not discussing policy is leaving her open to crushing credibility attacks from bernie. bad advice.

umairh	695432481936318465	2016-02-05T02:23:18	OK, at least I know what it is. I'm just saying as a voter I have no clue what Hillary actually wants to do. 
umairh	695431692564082688	2016-02-05T02:20:10	The semantic debate is so useless. On the other hand we have two candidates fighting over who's more liberal, aka hell has frozen over.
umairh	695430092932018176	2016-02-05T02:13:49	and it's irritating me by now. i just wanna hear what she actually wants to do. i guess though the rhetoric is the answer. ok i'm done.
umairh	695429946437554178	2016-02-05T02:13:14	we're entering crazy season in this election. but hillary's not going to convince (young) people with rhetoric vs policy. it's a mistake.
umairh	695429546615533570	2016-02-05T02:11:39	let's take healthcare. hillary says she'll "improve aka". what does that mean? bernie's solution is obvious, actual policy.
umairh	695428918367485952	2016-02-05T02:09:09	hillary offers rhetoric ("get the economy going"), bernie offers actual policies. it's a striking difference. we're way past rhetoric.
umairh	695428556386467841	2016-02-05T02:07:42	i think hillary's pitch as more socially liberal than bernie is deeply cynical millennial pandering. and i think it's foolish to believe it.

umairh	695243610674040832	2016-02-04T13:52:48	I kind of agree. I think it's more like we've been brainwashed into extremism and can't believe it doesn't work.

umairh	695243610443399168	2016-02-04T13:52:48	JackYoest dude. Relax. It's not worth it and I'm not who you think I am.
umairh	695239646993911808	2016-02-04T13:37:03	Why do Millenials love Bernie? Start with FREE COLLEGE TUITION.     Student debt is the crippling reality.
umairh	695221406825582592	2016-02-04T12:24:34	literature has many great opening lines but for me two stand out: "Mother died today. Or maybe, yesterday; I can't be sure." AlbertCamus
umairh	695221280077914112	2016-02-04T12:24:04	LOL how long is this game of being totally wrong gonna go on?  
umairh	695220194369732608	2016-02-04T12:19:45	Exactly. What if someone forces you to say yes? Such a simple idea, and libertarianism ignores, elides it totally.  
umairh	695219630869188609	2016-02-04T12:17:31	Look. We're essentially trying to make up for flat wages with cheap money. Rates flat forever if no wage gains.  
umairh	695218886925533184	2016-02-04T12:14:33	The only explanation for prolonged stagnation when the solutions are obvious and simple is extremism (ie, trickle down ideology)
umairh	695218441557512192	2016-02-04T12:12:47	Even Friedrich Hayek, when arguing for basic income, said employers had coercive power in terms of wage setting. 
umairh	695217873443254273	2016-02-04T12:10:32	Seriously. The libertarian definition of force is in itself not just stunted, but oppressive. Ironically. 
umairh	695217238694064128	2016-02-04T12:08:00	Economies are shrinking because governments won't invest because of extremist ideology. It's that simple.  
umairh	695216839710883840	2016-02-04T12:06:25	Great read. Depressing read. Appitalism and its discontents. 
umairh	695215482027249664	2016-02-04T12:01:02	Like I and everyone else who gets the economy said... 
umairh	695214749689237505	2016-02-04T11:58:07	Reads like something out of a failed state. Incredible.

umairh	695091656815697921	2016-02-04T03:48:59	philmartie true! main issues bigger than politics. plenty of room to disagree politically.
umairh	695090908136632320	2016-02-04T03:46:01	I've listened and listened to Hillary but I still can't really say what her policies would be. Bernie I get. Even Cruz and Trump I get.
umairh	695090660949520386	2016-02-04T03:45:02	jmitura sure, let me have a think!
umairh	695088404225204224	2016-02-04T03:36:04	philmartie yeah, I've never written about any of this at length. Oh wait 😂😂💥
umairh	695088238382473216	2016-02-04T03:35:24	thedaviddawson indeed, a shift to an mmpr or full pr system would be truly radical. Shame us left doesn't study poli sci!
umairh	695087138887622656	2016-02-04T03:31:02	What the hell was that question
umairh	695086996755189760	2016-02-04T03:30:28	thedaviddawson yup. these questions of institutional design are the really big ones. and personally very interesting to me :)
umairh	695085962020405249	2016-02-04T03:26:22	thedaviddawson i couldn't agree more. proportional representation's the cutting edge, presidency's an obsolete software for politics.
umairh	695083563159588864	2016-02-04T03:16:50	Politics aside, being President must be a terrible job. The campaigning alone would probably kill most of us. Or at least me :)
umairh	695083364886396929	2016-02-04T03:16:02	If every millennial voted in every election for the next five years, we'd probably live in a working country.  
umairh	695082044431470592	2016-02-04T03:10:48	It's an interesting election because Americans finally have true choices. Neolib, social democracy, theoconservatism, fascism all on offer.
umairh	695081782467764224	2016-02-04T03:09:45	Hillary's platform is essentially conservative. Back to 90s neoliberal Clintonianism. OK. But that's not really joining the advanced world.
umairh	695081399569793024	2016-02-04T03:08:14	Hillary can stop the US from regressing, and keep it stagnating. But I think only Bernie's policies can take it forward. The big difference.
umairh	695078153878949888	2016-02-04T02:55:20	stilgherrian LOLLLLL *cries*
umairh	695076689827733505	2016-02-04T02:49:31	Ok? Now I reaaally don't care what your politics are, hell I'm a conservative. Think. Don't be foolish dogmatists.
umairh	695076455085170688	2016-02-04T02:48:35	I really will stop there. To me all this is a referendum on whether the U.S. wants to join the most advanced nations. Chances are dwindling.
umairh	695076186247020549	2016-02-04T02:47:31	You know, nothing Bernie is proposing is in any way radical. It's been tested in every other advanced country and it works. Better.
umairh	695075860706168832	2016-02-04T02:46:13	JasonPackman lololol thanks!! And yes 😂👍
umairh	695075793525956609	2016-02-04T02:45:57	jburne20 seriously, thank you
umairh	695075721253937152	2016-02-04T02:45:40	Sigh, all the idiot techno libertarians tweeting me who think taxes are just personal costs not social benefits. The stupid, it's painful.
umairh	695075165336702976	2016-02-04T02:43:27	I'll stop there. I think if millennials don't mobilize for Bernie now, they don't have anyone to blame. And I'm not even a Bernie fan 😎👍
umairh	695074860721115136	2016-02-04T02:42:15	You're really dumb  
umairh	695074768370954241	2016-02-04T02:41:53	I'm not a social democrat. But it should be obvious to us all by now how desperately badly the U.S. needs a shot of it to rebalance things.
umairh	695074484613681152	2016-02-04T02:40:45	Personally, if I was effed as millennials I'd stop looking for political perfection and gladly take basically sane policies. Oh wait I am.
umairh	695074106824351744	2016-02-04T02:39:15	The progressive/moderate thing elides the real issue. It's the hardest leftists who don't support Bernie. Ironically. As it ever was.
umairh	695073632893157376	2016-02-04T02:37:22	Bernie is probably millennials last shot at a decent life. After him, too late. No pensions, retirement, savings, raises, assets. Dystopia.
umairh	695072918485798912	2016-02-04T02:34:32	It's surreal and sad to hear Bernie calling for a revolution so the us can have what the rest of the advanced world did decades ago.
umairh	695072355173982209	2016-02-04T02:32:17	Hillary vs Bernie is about whether the U.S. catches up with the rest of the advanced world vs how far behind it'll stay.
umairh	695070178959364096	2016-02-04T02:23:39	strong, strong answers from bernie. i really hope millennials get off their apathetic backsides and actually mobilize for him. last chance.
umairh	695042830234972160	2016-02-04T00:34:58	alalusim we can't really judge people by intrinsics unless we're omniscient
umairh	695025349583855616	2016-02-03T23:25:30	thanks! you put it better than i did :) 
umairh	695024007314325504	2016-02-03T23:20:10	Good q. Look at many real indicators, not just one poor one. IE GDP "growing" but wages flat, social progress flat.

umairh	694667489049976833	2016-02-02T23:43:30	As the Twitter pie shrinks, the already OTT abuse and squabbling is only gonna get worse. Like any economy, I suppose.
umairh	694667298599235585	2016-02-02T23:42:44	I think we overestimate the degree to which things change. As far as I can see, industries like books, TV, film remain essentially the same.
