seanmdav	714848652653559809	2016-03-29T16:16:14	You ignored all of the evidence and violated a plain duty of care to your employee, all in service of Trump. Own it. 
seanmdav	714846396709527552	2016-03-29T16:07:16	So a Trump property had the ballroom footage, which police got 1 day after Lewandowski said he’d never met Fields 
seanmdav	714847979346104320	2016-03-29T16:13:34	There was eyewitness testimony, victim testimony, video, and audio. You deliberately ignored all of it.

seanmdav	714845682696368130	2016-03-29T16:04:26	Coffey is a pefect fit for Lewandowski. Like Trump, he assaults women and loves Hillary

seanmdav	708305746069479425	2016-03-11T14:57:04	Yeah, so that's actually irrelevant for FEC registration purposes. Why are you falsely masquerading as a PAC?
