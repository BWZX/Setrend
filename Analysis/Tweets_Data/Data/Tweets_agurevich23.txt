agurevich23	683474545987158016	2016-01-03T02:26:44	bennpeifert MarkYusko agurevich23 More like US 1929 = China 2015.  End of incremental urbanization and associated demand.
agurevich23	683459846021214208	2016-01-03T01:28:20	agurevich23 China financial system not subject to market in the same way as US-more akin to Japan. So, 2015 China = 1990 Japan?
agurevich23	683458608848211968	2016-01-03T01:23:25	IMO a more important question is not whether 2015 in US  = 2000 in US, but whether 2015 in China = 2007 in US.

agurevich23	683365305452642304	2016-01-02T19:12:39	Chris_arnade yvessmith there is a good point here but TBH I doubt that the crisis has been much exacerbated by the "shorts".

agurevich23	682242853825724416	2015-12-30T16:52:26	groditi govttrader I generally don't have a target duration. But I weigh MTM potential vs. slide. Usually favor slide as I hold long-term
agurevich23	682241827534057472	2015-12-30T16:48:21	groditi govttrader I've pondered this before. When betting on flattening rally prioritize higher duration or cheapest bond?
agurevich23	682239711335682048	2015-12-30T16:39:57	govttrader groditi Yes I called it true asset swap value, when I launched the asset swap trading at JPM.
agurevich23	682238977764540416	2015-12-30T16:37:02	govttrader groditi so what's the cheapest bond on the curve? Best "hump" carry, best true asset swap level?
agurevich23	682237781821685761	2015-12-30T16:32:17	govttrader groditi are you adjusting for the fact that discount bonds = higher modified duration?
