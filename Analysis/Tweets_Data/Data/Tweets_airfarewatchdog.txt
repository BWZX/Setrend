airfarewatchdog	713439321328586752	2016-03-25T18:56:03	nyillini311 just look for one way fares. A to B on one airline and then B to A on another rather than RT's on one airline
airfarewatchdog	713439150448447492	2016-03-25T18:55:23	nyillini311 what we mean is for example $44 NYC DAL and $36 DFW-NYC United.  not connecting flights
airfarewatchdog	713438958718492672	2016-03-25T18:54:37	nyillini311 and if the fare is $44 it's easier to "eat" the change fee/fare on just that segment
airfarewatchdog	713438717889941504	2016-03-25T18:53:40	nyillini311 actually chances are you'll just be changing one flight not the RT. And Southwest doesn't charge a rebooking fee

airfarewatchdog	693212003670843393	2016-01-29T23:19:55	OGMelo_ there are other sites you could try, such as 
airfarewatchdog	693211821625450497	2016-01-29T23:19:12	OGMelo_ on the website it states Tu/We/Sa thru March 9. So when you see that you know it's not for you. Many low fares are Tu/We/Sa
airfarewatchdog	693210794755014656	2016-01-29T23:15:07	van_Eyck you can eliminate them from email alerts. Or any airline

airfarewatchdog	693208852691566592	2016-01-29T23:07:24	OGMelo_ it's not "misleading" at all. Misleading is the fare is unbookable. It's usually just a sample date in any case.

airfarewatchdog	692388672079986688	2016-01-27T16:48:18	beaucoupbougee you should still use repellent. If you're infected you can spread it back in the US if a Zika mosquito bites you and someone
