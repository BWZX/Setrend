sangerkatz	713079388947001344	2016-03-24T19:05:49	But thanks to the CBO for updating as new data becomes available. Even if it is a little weird, 6 years later, as JeffYoung points out.
sangerkatz	713078949505531904	2016-03-24T19:04:04	All these changes are a reminder that it's hard to estimate the exact effects of complex new pieces of social policy.

sangerkatz	713078095029354500	2016-03-24T19:00:40	But, important to note: CBO estimates on Obamacare's overall effects on the uninsured are very similar to past estimates. Only change by 1m.
sangerkatz	713077198953926656	2016-03-24T18:57:07	Last March, CBO projected 27 million uninsured people under the ACA by 2023. The new projection is 28 million.
