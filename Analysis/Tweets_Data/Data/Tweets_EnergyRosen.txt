EnergyRosen	705520892852494336	2016-03-03T22:31:03	So now we get to see it, we are going to get to see how much we can stress this system that has been built up for years.
EnergyRosen	705520656293732352	2016-03-03T22:30:07	Another saving grace for producers has been the refiners but that is coming to an end. These margins are only getting worse.
EnergyRosen	705520305935130625	2016-03-03T22:28:43	It is impressive how producers survived, whether it has been thanks to 'gracious lenders' or efficiency gains, they're still going....
EnergyRosen	705519951738753025	2016-03-03T22:27:19	Reality is, they haven't stopped producing and the oversupply situation is not any better today than it was months ago.
EnergyRosen	705519631751127040	2016-03-03T22:26:02	From OPEC/Saudi standpoint they know there are political ramifications with their fellow producing nations. So they talk &amp; meet to appease.
EnergyRosen	705519358206988288	2016-03-03T22:24:57	Smart refiners are now cutting runs for economic reasons, during a time when we are also in refinery turnaround.   Crude building....
EnergyRosen	705519018967474177	2016-03-03T22:23:36	Now we are looking at crude oil inventory building as it seasonally does but there is a problem with this season. There was no winter.
EnergyRosen	705518793846611969	2016-03-03T22:22:43	Floating storage for gasoline is enormous when compared to history.   Summer grade gasoline.

EnergyRosen	705518308750131200	2016-03-03T22:20:47	The rest of the excess refined products went into storage because the curves encouraged it
EnergyRosen	705518107461337089	2016-03-03T22:19:59	Due to prices coming lower and weather the demand for refined products was enough to absorb some of the increased production.
EnergyRosen	705517898614382592	2016-03-03T22:19:09	Refined product production maintained very high levels.   Just look back at crude runs in the past 12 months vs history.

EnergyRosen	705517342818701315	2016-03-03T22:16:57	Banks robo signing lending facilities, spr's getting filled, how much excess capacity there was in pipelines and storage.
EnergyRosen	705517075465424897	2016-03-03T22:15:53	It didn't happen for a host of reasons.
EnergyRosen	705516960453419008	2016-03-03T22:15:25	As inventory filled there seemed to be a sense that the end was coming for a material decrease in production.   But it never materialized
EnergyRosen	705516677136556032	2016-03-03T22:14:18	As the crude prices came lower curves were pressured in futures, physical markets were also pressured.

EnergyRosen	705516321245679616	2016-03-03T22:12:53	It is clear that Saudi didn't want to cut production in an effort to squeeze out any marginal barrel.   It's a game they know well.

EnergyRosen	697611884581822464	2016-02-11T02:43:28	Refining margins come down because of crude value going higher right?  Well,what crude market on this planet has gone UP in value?
EnergyRosen	697611642734039042	2016-02-11T02:42:31	A seasonal period with refining capacity coming offline, margins came DOWN.   Now why is that ?
EnergyRosen	697611446943883264	2016-02-11T02:41:44	As we continue this refining maintenance period we saw global 3-2-1 refining margins fall ~30% in one week.  Think about that
EnergyRosen	697610724764487680	2016-02-11T02:38:52	Refining run cuts, purely for economic head winds, will naturally increase refining margins OR accelerate the end for many E&amp;P operations

EnergyRosen	697609656294903808	2016-02-11T02:34:37	Without that refined product demand to draw down inventories now you have a saturated refined product market AND a saturated crude market
EnergyRosen	697609467098173441	2016-02-11T02:33:52	But too much of a good thing happened.....
EnergyRosen	697609385737134080	2016-02-11T02:33:33	For a while it worked. It was fascinating how efficient the market was to allow each segment to generate returns.
EnergyRosen	697609231357370369	2016-02-11T02:32:56	Different owners for refineries, or storage, or retail, or E&amp;P. This leads to each segment "doing their own thing".
EnergyRosen	697609016097300480	2016-02-11T02:32:05	Historically when this took place integrated oil would recognize this and adjust accordingly but the market is bifurcated now more than ever
EnergyRosen	697608809724932096	2016-02-11T02:31:15	What wasn't normal was the real seasonal demand that was supposed to take place to draw down these inventories.
EnergyRosen	697608603449102337	2016-02-11T02:30:26	But it wasn't real demand that was using product right now. It was "demand" for product to go to storage. Which is normal.
EnergyRosen	697608401988231168	2016-02-11T02:29:38	When that growth slowed, refined product inventories began to build. Market structure encouraged this to take place. This kept demand steady
EnergyRosen	697608115555069952	2016-02-11T02:28:30	The refined product demand had emerging market growth, abnormal winters (hearing demand) so the market was effectively using this product.
EnergyRosen	697607807940562945	2016-02-11T02:27:16	Eventually the music stopped. Many first thought it would be issues with running refineries but they proved to be great operators.
EnergyRosen	697607609076097024	2016-02-11T02:26:29	As global refining capacity expanded it was great, crude was bid, &amp; there was plenty of supply to meet an increasing refined product demand
EnergyRosen	697607384915693569	2016-02-11T02:25:36	The job of the market was to keep crude prices depressed relative to refined products. Crude demand had to be stimulated.

EnergyRosen	692717169856114688	2016-01-28T14:33:38	The oil market always has a large amount of variables. When more variables have uncertainty you get this volatility.
EnergyRosen	692716844189421568	2016-01-28T14:32:20	Just trade what you see, stay focused and be on the market.   This is all part of the process as the market is trying to digest a lot.
EnergyRosen	692716550948851712	2016-01-28T14:31:10	The other thing that is real right now is that global production is too high and demand growth is slowing.   Look at your futures curves
EnergyRosen	692716309797273600	2016-01-28T14:30:12	And when you don't know when, you're not taking more risk, you want to take less risk.

EnergyRosen	692714339564920832	2016-01-28T14:22:23	Historically, Russia has not cut production. Having said that, we are in abnormal times and anything is possible.
EnergyRosen	692713558837170180	2016-01-28T14:19:17	All they have to do is "talk" to get this market higher. It's a common practice as history tells us  Real or not, trade what you see
EnergyRosen	692713189423890432	2016-01-28T14:17:49	We are hearing that oil traders close to Moscow don't believe these cuts will happen.
EnergyRosen	692712835479138304	2016-01-28T14:16:24	You have to respect this move in oil.  Players that are short can't take the risk that these production cuts won't happen.
