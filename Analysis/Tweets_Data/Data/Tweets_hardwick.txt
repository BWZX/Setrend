hardwick	712469323172872192	2016-03-23T02:41:38	ReasonableDisco you said I call everything "amazing" and I was jokingly proving you wrong.
hardwick	712469184169443328	2016-03-23T02:41:05	ReasonableDisco don't complain about shit burgers when you're the one who brought turds to the BBQ ;)
hardwick	712469009489235968	2016-03-23T02:40:23	ReasonableDisco I never said I hate you, so now your a liar as well. No one forced you to question my integrity. That was your choice.
hardwick	712468490196627456	2016-03-23T02:38:19	Elec_Tech if you like Trump, fine! But no one is attacking YOU. We disagree. Why does that make me a moron? ONLY your opinion is valid?
hardwick	712468246163640320	2016-03-23T02:37:21	Elec_Tech if you can't watch a comedy show without being that sensitive then maybe don't watch comedy during an election year? I dunno.
hardwick	712468074331381761	2016-03-23T02:36:40	Elec_Tech so you think talking to people in real life is like a 6 minute segment on a comedy chat show? And yet you call ME a moron?
hardwick	712466169710510080	2016-03-23T02:29:06	brigo8371 midnight interesting idea....
hardwick	712465223479730177	2016-03-23T02:25:20	Elec_Tech I give about as much of a shit as the people following you. If you want to start a conversation "moron" is a bad way to do it.

hardwick	712464394794377217	2016-03-23T02:22:03	SexualStephenH nothing. How much can I pay you to fuck off for suggesting that? I LIKED IT. I'm allowed to have a differing opinion.

hardwick	712463984847233025	2016-03-23T02:20:25	Elec_Tech wanna side by side compare life choices vs moron quotient? Also nice troll account. Pretty brave not to tweet as yourself.

hardwick	694060832779415552	2016-02-01T07:32:52	RealFordKirby the sad part is that you fail to see that you used bullying tactics. Read how aggressive your tweets were. Ok for you then?

hardwick	684498166847152128	2016-01-05T22:14:14	mcboo22 oh jesus ok fine stop watching. I give up. you're unhappy with the show I get it. take care and thanks for watching before.
hardwick	684494534403731456	2016-01-05T21:59:48	mcboo22 our mission is to make fun of everyone as equally as possible but w/ the crazypants stuff Trump says there's more fodder.
hardwick	684494391776419840	2016-01-05T21:59:14	mcboo22 so it hasn't occurred to you that w/ so many people vying for the rep nom now maybe THAT'S why they get a lot of focus? Also Trump.
hardwick	684490690600894464	2016-01-05T21:44:32	mcboo22 I honestly have no fucking clue. There‚Äôs no conspiracy, and that‚Äôs not how things work on the show.
hardwick	684476432026697728	2016-01-05T20:47:53	mcboo22 FOD doesn‚Äôt own the show or pay me you moron. Viacom does. Research before you attack. And no one tells me what I have to say.
hardwick	684454276819742721	2016-01-05T19:19:50	castfxman JenniferMWolff also jonahray is like a brother to me so I get EXTRA crusty about it.

hardwick	684450719735377921	2016-01-05T19:05:42	RoskoRay I'm going to watch it this week!
hardwick	684440205726629888	2016-01-05T18:23:55	Jan 14-16! Part of my handful of shows before I shoot the comedy special at month's end. I've missed you, Nashville. 
hardwick	684438565363699712	2016-01-05T18:17:24	brettelliott36 just TD! That‚Äôs rad!
hardwick	684438477107150849	2016-01-05T18:17:03	mcboo22 hmm‚Ä¶I wonder what the political leanings of the head of Viacom are‚Ä¶if only there was an engine that searched things‚Ä¶oh well.
hardwick	684436852711927809	2016-01-05T18:10:36	@TeamPeapod heyooooooooooooo
hardwick	684385717074591744	2016-01-05T14:47:24	pstone1984 that is fantastic!
hardwick	684377723922321408	2016-01-05T14:15:39	QuinnDaGhost how dare you try to shame me when you didn‚Äôt do adequate research. Bernie is a fair guy so that doesn‚Äôt represent him well.
hardwick	684376799426420736	2016-01-05T14:11:58	QuinnDaGhost  I mean for crap‚Äôs sake dude. Do ONE Google search before you rage.
hardwick	684376379282960384	2016-01-05T14:10:18	QuinnDaGhost talk about false equivalence. Or just hypocrisy. At least get all the info before you flip out. How many links do you want?
hardwick	684376040362262528	2016-01-05T14:08:57	QuinnDaGhost are you insane? Have you not seen the Trump stuff on our show? Talk about imbalanced. You see one episode and freak out?
hardwick	684375825072820225	2016-01-05T14:08:06	SplendentSweven BillSchulz I wonder with all of the spelling/grammar errors if he might actually be purposely &amp; subtly trolling all of us‚Ä¶
hardwick	684374219002544128	2016-01-05T14:01:43	QuinnDaGhost don‚Äôt take the silly comedy show that seriously. Honestly. Economize your rage.
hardwick	684373812087934978	2016-01-05T14:00:06	QuinnDaGhost also Trump has gotten it WAY worse. People like you laugh at everyone else until it falls NEAR you then freak TF out.
hardwick	684373566620434432	2016-01-05T13:59:07	QuinnDaGhost ugh I liked it better when you were going away. Your rage is unwelcome. Colbert had 21 min alone and room for more nuance.
hardwick	684372442794475522	2016-01-05T13:54:40	mcboo22 midnight Idiocracy
hardwick	684371967219085312	2016-01-05T13:52:46	QuinnDaGhost We make fun of EVERY candidate equally. Not just the ones YOU don‚Äôt like. It‚Äôs very Bernie-like, actually.
hardwick	684370574290726912	2016-01-05T13:47:14	LongestNameOnTw would you rather we make fun of his ideas? Comedy show. ALL candidates get teased. That is equal, fair, and Bern-like.
hardwick	684370217913331712	2016-01-05T13:45:49	QuinnDaGhost totally your right. But maybe avoid comedy during election season if you‚Äôre this sensitive. Pretty dramatic reaction there.
hardwick	684310955962937345	2016-01-05T09:50:20	slgseth sure if you hate smart jokes

hardwick	684295961426841600	2016-01-05T08:50:45	loudersoft well there's the ownership issue and it's probably a REALLY expensive show to make.

hardwick	683836658131664897	2016-01-04T02:25:39	Stooert_J what's wrong with, "Hey Neil! Just curious if the mics were having issues? It sounded garbled on my end. Big fan! Thanks!"?
hardwick	683836441927925760	2016-01-04T02:24:47	Stooert_J Yeah, I get it. But read your tweet again and pretend someone sent it to you. It reads aggressive and "complaint desk entitled".
hardwick	683829865158578176	2016-01-04T01:58:39	Stooert_J not questioning your intention, but telling someone who gave you a FREE, optional thing it's "garbage" is douchey. FYI.
