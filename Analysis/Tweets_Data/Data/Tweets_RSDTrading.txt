RSDTrading	685583503262531584	2016-01-08T22:06:59	@shomikghosh2 This market has fallen faster than I expected. Hence the inability to add to shorts. I hate adding on down days.
RSDTrading	685582804994764800	2016-01-08T22:04:12	@shomikghosh2 I'll be adding to current positions held first.
RSDTrading	685582233655050240	2016-01-08T22:01:56	@shomikghosh2 On any green I'll short all the way up to the 200dma. If we continue to crash I'll cover around SPY 187.
RSDTrading	685582118534041600	2016-01-08T22:01:29	@shomikghosh2 Typically in this market configuration I am 50% short, however I never got the opportunity. Read: to slow.

RSDTrading	685210561185878016	2016-01-07T21:25:03	In the current market configuration our process requires us to be  30% long / 50% short. We'll work towards that tomorrow and next week.
