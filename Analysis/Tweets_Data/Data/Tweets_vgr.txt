vgr	722587439324213248	2016-04-20T00:47:25	zem42 well, creative destruction does not imply a zero-mean process... it can rise to a max like entropy.
vgr	722584595212808192	2016-04-20T00:36:07	zem42 Something like that. Civilization being defined in some sort of Kolmogorov complexity terms as net algorithmic capability of society.

vgr	722580258088558594	2016-04-20T00:18:53	zem42 agreed... definition in terms of symmetry/integrals is much broader than merely a degenerate stable path that satisfies it

vgr	722579550505271297	2016-04-20T00:16:04	zem42 Possibly ineffables like "brand" or "narrative" that seem to have continuity while everything else churns, some set of stable memes
vgr	722577929113247744	2016-04-20T00:09:37	zem42 One measure is relative persistence of social elites across economic eras. They imprint their social patterns onto new econ-canvases

vgr	722106953091010561	2016-04-18T16:58:08	GabrielDuquette of course some never get that far. Can consider it arrested development or contentment depending on pov
vgr	722106767853813760	2016-04-18T16:57:24	GabrielDuquette people at some point start wanting belonging/esteem in relation to all humanity as they outgrow subcultures that made them
vgr	722106532859543552	2016-04-18T16:56:28	GabrielDuquette translation from Jung-speak: if esteem/belonging in simpatico subculture is enough, you haven't integrated psyche yet
vgr	722106214889295872	2016-04-18T16:55:12	GabrielDuquette "parody"...?
vgr	722106009368399872	2016-04-18T16:54:23	GabrielDuquette Basics have gotten 'easy' in developed world, but only if you don't factor in aging, retirement, healthcare costs of future
vgr	722105670384746496	2016-04-18T16:53:02	GabrielDuquette Whether it's time to hit esteem/belonging directly or whether it's premature depends on how much abundance we think we have
vgr	722105397687951360	2016-04-18T16:51:57	GabrielDuquette I think you're restating my "shaving the shadowyak" sub-argument in Dent in the Universe post
vgr	722105034209492992	2016-04-18T16:50:30	jsfour that's always been true. Delusions start where expectations of risk-free returns exist. One risk scenario just got real ~early 1990s
vgr	722104208342654976	2016-04-18T16:47:13	jsfour some level of being accountable to the society that enables our lives is inevitable, but danger= "investor" class being any 1 subset
vgr	722103003797262336	2016-04-18T16:42:26	jsfour there have been experiments along those lines, but I don't think they've been any good...Lots more experiments need to be tried out.
vgr	722102574728368128	2016-04-18T16:40:44	jsfour that's a specific possible mechanism. I don't like it since it seems to trade debt peonage for slavery. Soln needs more imagination
vgr	722102064667447296	2016-04-18T16:38:42	GabrielDuquette "No [hu]man is an island" argument, unsustainability of pure isolationism above say Amish scale etc etc
vgr	722101758546169857	2016-04-18T16:37:29	GabrielDuquette you can try to find isolated subgraph that doesn't connect to whole society, and is unrelated to market. I'm skeptical.
vgr	722101215652220930	2016-04-18T16:35:20	GabrielDuquette ...trust in a port authority translates to indirect validation of the value of oceanographers hired by them on your behalf
vgr	722100990267097089	2016-04-18T16:34:26	GabrielDuquette the gap is filled by institutions. You may not get why world needs oceanographers, but if you get why world needs ports...
vgr	722100684443619329	2016-04-18T16:33:13	GabrielDuquette Separate topic. If broader society can't see value in (say) oceanographers as easily as musicians, how to validate former?
vgr	722100102760783873	2016-04-18T16:30:55	jsfour no it isn't. The instrument is debt which doesn't go to zero with bankruptcy. Tax feedback loop is too coarse, too aggregated
vgr	722099602367746048	2016-04-18T16:28:55	graaaaaagh if you can get people to agree on the same idea of what non-economic frames to use for valuing, without either markets or wars
vgr	722098942024921088	2016-04-18T16:26:18	GabrielDuquette The arguments are related. It's dumb to dictate how best a human can live the most generative life they can.
vgr	722094196962668544	2016-04-18T16:07:27	vgr I wrote about this awhile back. Liberal arts majors aren't the root of student loan debt problem.

vgr	722094709531750400	2016-04-18T16:09:29	16/ But it's a big leap from abandoning designed-by-cronyism-for-cronyism safety nets in favor of cash to thinking UBI can "solve" dignity
vgr	722094079866064896	2016-04-18T16:06:59	15/ Pointless humiliation (being paternalistically given "food" stamps instead of cash to buy "vegetables" like pizza) should be avoided...
vgr	722093150999711744	2016-04-18T16:03:17	14/ Biggest point of contention in system design: is "dignity" (as opposed to food, shelter, healthcare) a safety net variable?
vgr	722092662942146560	2016-04-18T16:01:21	13/ Safety net should be designed with "good" failure in mind for 10-15 trial-and-error pivot opps btwn 14-30. Current: all failure is bad
vgr	722091824395857920	2016-04-18T15:58:01	12/ This will of course be wrong at the margins. Prior odds for/against certain people becoming net assets/liabilities may be huge

vgr	722090199593779200	2016-04-18T15:51:34	9/ What when this thing melts down? Neoliberals will want the banks bailed out and the debtors abandoned. Progressives will want a jubilee.
vgr	722089372800004096	2016-04-18T15:48:16	8/ The conceit of progressivism is that education choices are human-dignity affirmations for which societies should shoulder all risk
vgr	722088849082454016	2016-04-18T15:46:12	7/ The conceit of neoliberalism is that 19-year-olds can place error-free 40-year bets and deserve only debt-funding, bearing all the risk
vgr	722088419279511553	2016-04-18T15:44:29	6/ College education choices are where these two hypocrisies meet, creating a perfect storm of stupidity
vgr	722088213095952384	2016-04-18T15:43:40	5/ Both neoliberalism, progressivism share a single existential concern today: investing effectively in humans. Both respond with hypocrisy
vgr	722087795762683904	2016-04-18T15:42:00	4/ In a creative-class dominant economy, you can't invest in humans like pieces of equipment for which you're predicting demand 40 years out

vgr	697167273786634240	2016-02-09T21:16:45	So youth is generally high-leverage+ deterministic. You can consciously steer 90 deg with 3k. But it's also too simple to enjoy serendipity.
vgr	697166995683282945	2016-02-09T21:15:39	So "inertia" is wrong word in a way. Along some vectors you have high or even infinite inertia (kids?). Along others, you can turn on a dime
vgr	697166758805790720	2016-02-09T21:14:42	The good news: as your life gets more complex, it also becomes weirdly sensitive to being massively steered by serendipitous minor events.
