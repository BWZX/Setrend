rickygervais	704053408668524546	2016-02-28T21:19:47	cjwerleman But you wouldn't start using the term "New Muslims" to describe ISIS, or "New Christians" to describe The KKK. It smears truth.

rickygervais	704049971448963072	2016-02-28T21:06:08	cjwerleman OK, well, I could be wrong, but I really don't think his example is the same as "torturing people for their beliefs"
rickygervais	704047002091397121	2016-02-28T20:54:20	cjwerleman Really? That's mental.
rickygervais	704046123384770560	2016-02-28T20:50:51	cjwerleman I wanted to make sure you agreed that joking about someone being tortured for their beliefs is worse than joking about beliefs.
rickygervais	704044619949023233	2016-02-28T20:44:52	You're allowed to make jokes about people's beliefs. You're not allowed to actually torture people for them. It's a simple rule of thumb.

rickygervais	702069597441236992	2016-02-23T09:56:50	Goon_Boy absolutely. Twitter is like a riot. People join it with a thousand different agendas and points and what's left is a mess.
rickygervais	702068277758074880	2016-02-23T09:51:35	Goon_Boy I totally get your point though. But I feel that there was no intend on Spellchecker's behalf to suggest that all Muslims are arab
rickygervais	702067389832241152	2016-02-23T09:48:04	Goon_Boy I see your point, but I think it's clear that it's hateful things they were saying that was the issue not the language.
rickygervais	702062686876606464	2016-02-23T09:29:22	Goon_Boy Cheers
rickygervais	702062600603959296	2016-02-23T09:29:02	Goon_Boy GSpellchecker Sure, but I think that's more typical of "everybody on Twitter." We all think we're right.
rickygervais	702061675105619968	2016-02-23T09:25:21	Goon_Boy GSpellchecker But I honestly can't think of an alternative way to word it. He didn't say look what arabs or muslims are saying.
rickygervais	702059567635685376	2016-02-23T09:16:59	Goon_Boy GSpellchecker skyvalley9 By the way, I don't think that all atheists are typically ignorant, but that's a different point.
rickygervais	702059304845762560	2016-02-23T09:15:56	Goon_Boy GSpellchecker skyvalley9 Genuine question: How should he have worded his tweet about people who speak Arabic?

rickygervais	693382569581264896	2016-01-30T10:37:41	We didn't evolve "from" modern day chimps, but rather "with" them, from a common ancestor. Like cousins share grandparents.
