binarybits	726138843133530113	2016-04-29T19:59:25	pojomke Fair enough. Post-retirement planning can get confusing.
binarybits	726138280140509185	2016-04-29T19:57:11	pojomke But investing in a target date fund gives you results that are practically as good as you'd get with the best professional advisor.
binarybits	726138133281169408	2016-04-29T19:56:36	pojomke I am not persuaded by this. The problem is experts disagree about precise allocation, not that target date funds are doing it wrong

binarybits	726082024918888448	2016-04-29T16:13:39	homer78749 I mean index funds would be 95 percent of mutual funds, not 95 percent of the stock market.

binarybits	725436183493353472	2016-04-27T21:27:18	ModeledBehavior then I think we agree. Remote operators will definitely get involved in unusual situations.

binarybits	725435622882693122	2016-04-27T21:25:05	ModeledBehavior so I would expect the car to "steer" but a remote operator to supply route guidance.

binarybits	723636401426845696	2016-04-22T22:15:37	tiredboredblog and in the log publicly produced maps will probably be more efficient than a bunch of companies making redundant maps.
binarybits	723636269100765184	2016-04-22T22:15:05	tiredboredblog but communications between transportation departments and self driving car companies is going to be a big deal.

binarybits	723512576550809600	2016-04-22T14:03:35	valkenburgh Google will have reams of data. The expensive part will be paying people to analyze it.
binarybits	723512527632633856	2016-04-22T14:03:23	valkenburgh I think the ubiquitous sensor part will be easy since the self-driving cars themselves are going to be bristling with sensors.
binarybits	723510045393203200	2016-04-22T13:53:31	The need for detailed maps is another reason I think self-driving cars are going to be rented rather than owned.

binarybits	722837789356662784	2016-04-20T17:22:13	tiredboredblog Yeah, it's a challenge to figure out how much technical detail to include. Here are some good pieces...
binarybits	722821090133684225	2016-04-20T16:15:51	pjdoland I think people being able to read a book, watch TV, or do their makeup in the car will be a big gain in its own right.
binarybits	722820118858698752	2016-04-20T16:12:00	pjdoland Ah, I'm skeptical that that part will be significant. For me the big gains are mostly about saving lives and human time.
binarybits	722819152088399873	2016-04-20T16:08:09	pjdoland er, how you define "everything"
binarybits	722819061906706432	2016-04-20T16:07:48	pjdoland Though I guess it depends on how strictly you define "all"
binarybits	722818942385786880	2016-04-20T16:07:19	pjdoland I think having half the cars be driverless will produce big gains, and I think it'll take 15-20 years.

binarybits	722816538277842944	2016-04-20T15:57:46	benthompson ezraklein I interpret "pre-designated routes" to mean that they'll be able to go along, say 16th Street but not 15th or 17th.
binarybits	722815994146586625	2016-04-20T15:55:36	luis_in_140 Oh yeah, I think mapping is going to be precondition for safe self-driving. I just think it won't be a big barrier at scale.

binarybits	719887090570432512	2016-04-12T13:57:11	tylercowen Yes, I think urbanists sometimes oversell the cheaper-housing argument for density.

binarybits	715612648742731777	2016-03-31T18:52:05	ericries civicskunkworks So I would expect $1 of extra wages to produce a lot less than $1 of extra profits for local businesses.

binarybits	708057526185680896	2016-03-10T22:30:43	MayankSeksaria "Diminishing marginal returns" aren't really a problem because the Fed can make money for free.
binarybits	708057457252245505	2016-03-10T22:30:27	MayankSeksaria And if I'm wrong, this would be great news because we could fund government entirely by printing money.
binarybits	708057385332568064	2016-03-10T22:30:10	MayankSeksaria I say that would cause a lot of inflation.
binarybits	708057338545086464	2016-03-10T22:29:59	MayankSeksaria This is the point of my hypothetical about buying every government bond in the US (or eurozone).
binarybits	708052773745643520	2016-03-10T22:11:50	MayankSeksaria I feel like we're going in circles here. If BoJ did enough QE they could produce inflation.
binarybits	708037003825319936	2016-03-10T21:09:11	MayankSeksaria In an NGDP targeting regime, a reducing in real GDP growth produces a corresponding rise in inflation.
binarybits	708036888444141569	2016-03-10T21:08:43	MayankSeksaria I don't understand what you mean by "potential ngdp.

binarybits	708033822194057218	2016-03-10T20:56:32	MayankSeksaria I'm also find with a 4.5 percent NGDP level target. The point is we need some kind of clear target.
binarybits	708033740119920641	2016-03-10T20:56:12	MayankSeksaria But monetary policy becomes harder to do at the zero bound, so a bit more inflation would have been helpful.
binarybits	708033603616305153	2016-03-10T20:55:40	MayankSeksaria Right, and I'm not saying differently.
binarybits	708033481138446336	2016-03-10T20:55:11	MayankSeksaria A 20 percent target would just give us 2 percent real growth and 18 percent inflation.
binarybits	708031386800807936	2016-03-10T20:46:51	MayankSeksaria I think we'd be in much better shape today if we'd adopted a 5 or even 5.5 percent NGDP target 20 years ago.
binarybits	708031181795811328	2016-03-10T20:46:02	MayankSeksaria Right, that's the problem NGDP targeting is trying to fix.
binarybits	708030904569085952	2016-03-10T20:44:56	sarahjeong Yes, I've been mildly excited about getting mail since I was a kid.
binarybits	708023788722626563	2016-03-10T20:16:40	MayankSeksaria Switching to LT and switching to NGDP are independent changes that would both make monetary policy better.
binarybits	708023665519153152	2016-03-10T20:16:10	MayankSeksaria Because I can't make every argument in every article. My level targeting argument applies to NGDP as well as inflation.
binarybits	708019140125134849	2016-03-10T19:58:12	MayankSeksaria If the ECB buys all of the government's bonds with no inflation then issuing bonds is effectively free.
binarybits	708011149296603138	2016-03-10T19:26:26	MayankSeksaria The ECB hasn't reached its 2 percent inflation target because it's not trying hard enough.
binarybits	708010987656507392	2016-03-10T19:25:48	MayankSeksaria I'm not saying this would be a good policy, just pointing out the ECB can hit an inflation target if they want to.
binarybits	708010468141604864	2016-03-10T19:23:44	MayankSeksaria I think it's much more likely that inflation would rise.
binarybits	708010311312396288	2016-03-10T19:23:07	MayankSeksaria If (2) is correct, that would be amazing. Just stop collecting taxes and fund government with money printing.
binarybits	708010236418924544	2016-03-10T19:22:49	MayankSeksaria Two possibilities: (1) inflation starts rising, (2) ECB eventually buys every bond on the continent.
binarybits	708010134677626880	2016-03-10T19:22:24	MayankSeksaria Suppose the ECB announced it was going to double QE every 3 months until inflation rose above 5 percent.
binarybits	708009630627192832	2016-03-10T19:20:24	MayankSeksaria not sure what CB is here.
binarybits	708006449641877504	2016-03-10T19:07:46	MayankSeksaria Probably low but it depends on what the central bank does.
binarybits	708006194682662913	2016-03-10T19:06:45	MayankSeksaria An NGDP futures market would be the best one. I don't think one exists, unfortunately.
binarybits	708003123932086272	2016-03-10T18:54:33	MayankSeksaria The inflation trend line isn't a fact about the universe, it's a policy choice.
binarybits	708002339270037505	2016-03-10T18:51:26	MayankSeksaria But anyway, all I wrote was "The experience of the past decade suggests..." not "proves"
binarybits	708002259335036930	2016-03-10T18:51:07	MayankSeksaria I think institutions like the ECB have cultures that persist from one leader to the next.
binarybits	708001856820256769	2016-03-10T18:49:31	MayankSeksaria Yes, I think that's probably right. But if they're going to target inflation it should be a level target.
binarybits	708001515840135168	2016-03-10T18:48:10	MayankSeksaria And certainly the ECB has done nothing to credibly commit to long-term dovishness.
binarybits	708001407077654529	2016-03-10T18:47:44	MayankSeksaria it's possible they've changed their ways but markets have reason for skepticism.
binarybits	708001313737547777	2016-03-10T18:47:21	MayankSeksaria My point is that they've been itching to hike in the past (in 2011 in Europe, 2015 in the US)
binarybits	708001211274887168	2016-03-10T18:46:57	MayankSeksaria Weak nominal growth would be a sign that the ECB has been too hawkish.
binarybits	708001157982109696	2016-03-10T18:46:44	MayankSeksaria I think dovish ECB and weak nominal growth are closer to opposites.
binarybits	707998933503635456	2016-03-10T18:37:54	Exciting to see a computer beat the best humans at Go.

binarybits	707998441532743680	2016-03-10T18:35:57	MayankSeksaria Yes.
binarybits	707995048391131136	2016-03-10T18:22:28	MayankSeksaria (Sorry, I mean a dovish fed or poor expected performance)
binarybits	707994959316656128	2016-03-10T18:22:06	MayankSeksaria This seems tricky because low projected rates could mean markets expect a hawkish ECB or they expect poor econ performance.

binarybits	700062888275398657	2016-02-17T21:02:53	catlin201 The key issue is that software updates have to be signed by Apple.

binarybits	699983480520863744	2016-02-17T15:47:21	ejenk It would be interesting to know how someone born in Japan in 1925 would fare under a 100% stock and 50/50 stock/bond strategies.
binarybits	699982691945619456	2016-02-17T15:44:13	edpiot I think you'd have to be very rich for 100 percent equities to be the right answer.

binarybits	699975261236891648	2016-02-17T15:14:41	ejenk Pretty sure the Japanese market was down between 1990 and 2010 even if you count dividends but let me know if I'm wrong.
binarybits	699975123084951552	2016-02-17T15:14:08	ejenk I'm not making a specific claim about Japanese investors. I'm just pointing out that the "stocks always go up" argument is wrong.
binarybits	699974829991141380	2016-02-17T15:12:59	HowieLempel yeah. No one wants to spend all of their money but many people don't have much cushion.
binarybits	699971287339376640	2016-02-17T14:58:54	ejenk Which is a good reason to have some of your money in stocks. But I don't think 100 percent.
binarybits	699971093285752832	2016-02-17T14:58:08	ejenk But I think most people with significant retirement savings are depending on the earnings.
binarybits	699970919306039296	2016-02-17T14:57:26	ejenk I guess if you're expecting SS to cover 100% of your day-to-day living needs then an all-stock portfolio isn't horrible.
binarybits	699970728398086144	2016-02-17T14:56:41	ejenk I don't think I'm making any assumptions about SS payments.
binarybits	699970141048721409	2016-02-17T14:54:21	Sorry, New York Times, it's dumb to have all your retirement savings in stocks at age 65.

binarybits	699676091884138496	2016-02-16T19:25:54	bilalhassam Scaling is obviously a much bigger issue now and lack of applications is still worrisome.
binarybits	699675978981888009	2016-02-16T19:25:27	bilalhassam Looking at my four reasons, I think the regulation point is less worrisome than it was back then. The other 3 still apply.
binarybits	699675890435883008	2016-02-16T19:25:06	bilalhassam To be clear, my point in that article wasn't that people shouldn't buy, just that they should make sure they know the risks.

binarybits	699674438929924096	2016-02-16T19:19:20	Rand_Simberg The Constitution gives the states the right to decide how to choose electors!
binarybits	699672777733902336	2016-02-16T19:12:44	Rand_Simberg Which is probably bad! But partisanship probably isn't going away so something is going to have to give.
binarybits	699670540966035456	2016-02-16T19:03:50	Rand_Simberg Yes. They also thought parties were bad. Problem is we now have ideologically polarized parties.

binarybits	699484789238321152	2016-02-16T06:45:44	rsingel The idea that Obama was being reasonable and Republicans unreasonable is at root a disagreement about policy.
binarybits	699484546375483392	2016-02-16T06:44:46	rsingel But it always takes two sides to have a standoff. Obama could have decided to give Republicans what they wanted in 2011.
binarybits	699484473763700736	2016-02-16T06:44:28	rsingel I don't really agree with the conservative view so I'm not the right person to argue with about this.
binarybits	699484262815367168	2016-02-16T06:43:38	AlexParkerDC Oh definitely. And exaggerated outrage at the other side's tactics is itself part of the rational strategy.
binarybits	699483961131692032	2016-02-16T06:42:26	dpinsen I think it might almost be time for a constitutional crisis. 
binarybits	699483788292833280	2016-02-16T06:41:45	rsingel Luckily for Obama the DC press corps mostly accepted Obama's framing of these confrontations.
binarybits	699483669468155904	2016-02-16T06:41:17	rsingel The conservative view is that Obama's refusal to consider serious budget cuts is what triggered the shutdowns.
binarybits	699482648557780992	2016-02-16T06:37:13	I should add: the other side might really be acting unreasonably, and pushing for less compromise on your side might be a rational response.
binarybits	699482250778447872	2016-02-16T06:35:38	rsingel Very few conservatives see things this way.
binarybits	699481555673214977	2016-02-16T06:32:53	dpinsen I think we're probably beyond compromise on a lot of issues at this point.
binarybits	699478091660443648	2016-02-16T06:19:07	Selective outrage about the other side's unwillingness to compromise is part of the polarization process that makes compromise impossible.

binarybits	699476731023986688	2016-02-16T06:13:42	keunwoo benadida Sure, but I think it's a reason to resist the urge to jump to a partisan interpretation of what's happening.

binarybits	698220009538064384	2016-02-12T18:59:57	kchoudhu My point isn't that we're about to have a recession. It's that we'll eventually have a recession and the Fed needs to be prepared.
binarybits	698219521438568448	2016-02-12T18:58:00	kchoudhu I hope you're right! I don't see how that's inconsistent with anything in my article.

binarybits	698190822832005120	2016-02-12T17:03:58	bljacka To put it in right-wing language, the Fed needs to become a lot more rule-based.

binarybits	697858882140504064	2016-02-11T19:04:57	mattyglesias I could see an argument for banning drive throughs and parking lots. I don't see why you'd want to ban one but not the other.
binarybits	697858574572240898	2016-02-11T19:03:44	matt_odell I like this idea but I'm skeptical they could generate significant revenue that way.
binarybits	697858398193319936	2016-02-11T19:03:02	emilymbadger It would just force people to park, get out of their cars, and walk into the store.
binarybits	697858318224748544	2016-02-11T19:02:43	emilymbadger And it's not obvious to me that banning drive-throughs would even reduce car use very much.

binarybits	692070301274869761	2016-01-26T19:43:12	flamsmark But I think it would be silly to say a taxpayer is a "thief" for wanting to renege on a promise made before he was born.

binarybits	691169041478713345	2016-01-24T08:01:55	catlin201 Yes, if we assume that the small-block people will win then this is a fair point.
binarybits	691168844702945280	2016-01-24T08:01:08	catlin201 But anyway the Bitcoin network has room for thousands of transactions like that.
binarybits	691168640050302980	2016-01-24T08:00:19	catlin201 Oh. I didn't realize you were taking that as a given.
binarybits	691168299535724544	2016-01-24T07:58:58	catlin201 The distinction you're trying to draw here doesn't make sense on the Bitcoin network.
binarybits	691167995113115648	2016-01-24T07:57:45	catlin201 What about a web app that does that entirely inside the customer's browser? 
binarybits	691166483431460865	2016-01-24T07:51:45	catlin201 But that's not the only kind of Bitcoin service.
binarybits	691166456596271104	2016-01-24T07:51:39	catlin201 If you mean "exchange," then I think we mostly agree.
binarybits	691166409796222976	2016-01-24T07:51:28	catlin201 Again, I think we're mostly using different definitions of "payment processor."

binarybits	691166046519169024	2016-01-24T07:50:01	catlin201 But also "openly flout" is the wrong way to think about it.
binarybits	691165602854146048	2016-01-24T07:48:15	catlin201 ORLY? 
binarybits	691164884382408704	2016-01-24T07:45:24	catlin201 AFAIK, the US government has made no effort todo what you describe.
binarybits	691164735031660544	2016-01-24T07:44:48	catlin201 Again, this isn't a theoretical question. Bitcoin has been widely studied for ~3 years now.
binarybits	691164357183553536	2016-01-24T07:43:18	catlin201 I don't mean because other countries would object in principle.
binarybits	691163597129539587	2016-01-24T07:40:17	catlin201 But AFAIK they haven't tried to do that and I doubt other countries would go along with it.
binarybits	691163536165220352	2016-01-24T07:40:02	catlin201 It's conceivable that the US could try to establish/coerce a global "no Bitcoin service without ID" requirement.
binarybits	691163061143605248	2016-01-24T07:38:09	catlin201 However, there are other types of possible Bitcoin-based financial intermediaries. These aren't so easy to regulate.
binarybits	691162874308358144	2016-01-24T07:37:25	catlin201 If you're talking about exchanges (trading dollars for Bitcoins), it's plausible that the US could exert significant influence.
binarybits	691162740807835649	2016-01-24T07:36:53	catlin201 I think our disagreement here might be about the ambiguity of "payment processor."
binarybits	691161614796591104	2016-01-24T07:32:24	catlin201 Again, defaults (in this case, whether you have to provide ID information to get an account) matter a lot.
binarybits	691161439487266816	2016-01-24T07:31:42	catlin201 So practically speaking, "don't offer accounts to Americans" means "don't run Bitcoin services at all."
binarybits	691161323745447936	2016-01-24T07:31:15	catlin201 The Bitcoin network doesn't have any sense of "account holders." Accounts are just random strings of numbers.
binarybits	691157957447434240	2016-01-24T07:17:52	catlin201 It's not going to be able to coerce other countries to adopt every single US financial regulation.
binarybits	691157895581454336	2016-01-24T07:17:38	catlin201 The US government has limited political capital. It can do that sort of thing with a few high-priority regulations.
binarybits	691157208311164928	2016-01-24T07:14:54	catlin201 Again, depends on what crimes we're talking about. Counter-terrorism yes. Gambling probably not.
binarybits	691156591173881856	2016-01-24T07:12:27	catlin201 The payment processor in question might not be located in the territory of the government in question.
binarybits	691155140569612290	2016-01-24T07:06:41	catlin201 The ones the government really cares about will still be enforced, but a lot of ones it cares less about won't be.
binarybits	691155035879837696	2016-01-24T07:06:16	catlin201 The lack of a central intermediary raises the costs of enforcing many types of regulation.
binarybits	691154960529166336	2016-01-24T07:05:58	catlin201 I think it makes more sense to think about this from the government's perspective.
binarybits	691154721911001089	2016-01-24T07:05:01	catlin201 But in practice the government doesn't care enough to spend the money and prosecute individual consumers.
binarybits	691154605242195968	2016-01-24T07:04:33	catlin201 Sure, so if the government cares enough it can probably figure out who is using Bitcoin to gamble.
binarybits	691153557194706945	2016-01-24T07:00:23	catlin201 Just as it's easier to say "no nudity on broadcast television" than "no nudity on the internet."
binarybits	691153425074130945	2016-01-24T06:59:52	catlin201 The latter.
binarybits	691153321026023424	2016-01-24T06:59:27	catlin201 There are still things the USG can do, but it can't go to Bitcoin, Inc with a list of merchants to kick off the network.
binarybits	691153174061826049	2016-01-24T06:58:52	catlin201 It's a lot harder to say "US citizens aren't allowed to gamble using the Bitcoin network."
binarybits	691153100791517185	2016-01-24T06:58:34	catlin201 It's easy for the US government to say (for example) "US citizens aren't allowed to gamble using the Visa network."
binarybits	691152959640571904	2016-01-24T06:58:01	catlin201 I think you're underestimating how much shifting defaults can change the scope of potential regulation.
binarybits	691151824993292288	2016-01-24T06:53:30	jeremyskog lol
binarybits	691151521413726208	2016-01-24T06:52:18	catlin201 Maybe they can't/shouldn't succeed, but this is a big reason the network is important and interesting.
binarybits	691151042801721349	2016-01-24T06:50:24	catlin201 Yes, I think that's the core issue. The Bitcoin community is trying to shift norms relating to payment networks.
binarybits	691149891792429056	2016-01-24T06:45:49	catlin201 There's a close analogy to the internet here. Yes, countries could make the internet illegal but most don't.
binarybits	691149678587559936	2016-01-24T06:44:58	pa49 Awesome. Looking forward to seeing how this works out in practice.
binarybits	691148864494145536	2016-01-24T06:41:44	catlin201 I'm not saying either of those is unreasonable, but they're both barriers to entry for certain kinds of payment processors.
binarybits	691148691684638721	2016-01-24T06:41:03	catlin201 Also, ACH is a reversible payment system so you have to have infrastructure in place to deal with disputed payments.
binarybits	691148416911568896	2016-01-24T06:39:58	catlin201 With Bitcoin you can serve the entire world without registering with anyone.
binarybits	691148273281830912	2016-01-24T06:39:23	catlin201 This is not an argument I can make in 140 characters, but just as one example I assume you have to register in the US.
binarybits	691147951364816896	2016-01-24T06:38:07	pa49 Oh sure, it's obviously true at the margin. I just don't know if it's a big enough effect to matter.
binarybits	691147677241884672	2016-01-24T06:37:01	catlin201 The FRS isn't open in the sense I mean. The Fed controls access and sets the rules for FRS-participating banks.
binarybits	691147428196675584	2016-01-24T06:36:02	pa49 I know the goal is to allow off-chain payments without intermediaries but I'd be more convinced if there was code implementing it.
binarybits	691147329135603712	2016-01-24T06:35:38	pa49 I probably do! Does the Lightning Network exist? All I see here are white papers. 
binarybits	691146224532131840	2016-01-24T06:31:15	catlin201 Who is "they" here?
binarybits	691146084224241664	2016-01-24T06:30:42	catlin201 Right, but there are no open dollar-based payment networks, and I think there are deep reasons for this.
binarybits	691145044775010304	2016-01-24T06:26:34	pa49 The "higher overhead -&gt; fewer full nodes" step is the one that seems most dubious to me.
binarybits	691144894023405568	2016-01-24T06:25:58	pa49 Increased txs-&gt;higher overhead for running a full node-&gt;fewer full nodes-&gt;censorship etc.
binarybits	691144722333704192	2016-01-24T06:25:17	catlin201 That might allow Bitcoin intermediaries to pursue disruptive business models Visa wouldn't allow on its network.
binarybits	691144610714914816	2016-01-24T06:24:50	catlin201 I don't need anyone's permission to become a Bitcoin payment processor.
binarybits	691144565600972800	2016-01-24T06:24:39	catlin201 The core argument here is permissionless innovation. I need Visa's permission to become a Visa payment processor.
binarybits	691140285330538496	2016-01-24T06:07:39	I'm trying to write up a plausible defense of the small-block position and finding it difficult.
binarybits	691138716342095873	2016-01-24T06:01:25	catlin201 The advantage of Bitcoin is supposed to be low barriers to entry, which I think depends on low transaction fees.
binarybits	691138469356240896	2016-01-24T06:00:26	catlin201 Yes, that's the point I'm making.
binarybits	691138122193735680	2016-01-24T05:59:03	konklone I guess maybe we'd get as much centralization with a 10 cent average on-chain transaction fee as $10.
binarybits	691137762561495040	2016-01-24T05:57:37	konklone Right, it's just a question of how powerful is this effect going to be.
binarybits	691135685361819648	2016-01-24T05:49:22	dpfrank07 Interesting. Did not know that was an element of their model.

binarybits	691131083895758848	2016-01-24T05:31:05	E.g. if on-chain transactions are expensive and off-chain ones are cheap, established intermediaries will have a cost advantage.

binarybits	687003092143968256	2016-01-12T20:07:55	CalebWatney Yeah. I also wonder if he'll find ways to subtly throw the people supporting him now under the bus.

binarybits	685162317944872960	2016-01-07T18:13:20	I'll add: If free-market thinkers were more pro-antitrust they could be touting this as a triumph of competition. 
binarybits	685161727852417026	2016-01-07T18:11:00	byersalex Since the subsidy wasn't explicit under the old system it's hard to say what the "interest rate" was then.
binarybits	685161429561901056	2016-01-07T18:09:49	byersalex I think it depends. Like I said, under the new system I just paid $100 up front and then installments after that.
binarybits	685159175903645696	2016-01-07T18:00:51	byersalex The main difference is the customers has a clearer idea of what she's getting.
binarybits	685159113370787840	2016-01-07T18:00:36	byersalex I guess I don't see a big difference between a 2-year contract and buying a phone with a 2-year installment plan.
binarybits	685158921141645312	2016-01-07T17:59:51	byersalex The important change is that it used to be hard to get a postpaid plan without a contract, now it's easy.
binarybits	685158843035287552	2016-01-07T17:59:32	byersalex Killing 2-year contracts does technically mean consumes have one fewer option.
binarybits	685158455456477184	2016-01-07T17:58:00	Matt_Cagle byersalex Right, although the device fee isn't an explicit line on the bill.
binarybits	685158063289008128	2016-01-07T17:56:26	byersalex Whereas under the old model you'd keep paying the higher price forever whether or not you got a new phone.
binarybits	685158004791062529	2016-01-07T17:56:12	byersalex Only difference is that the $20/month is an explicit charge that goes away after 18 or 24 months.
binarybits	685157885580558336	2016-01-07T17:55:44	byersalex When I bought my most recent phone I could get a 16GB phone for $20/month or a 64GB one for $20/month plus $99 up front.
binarybits	685157751731937281	2016-01-07T17:55:12	byersalex Sure. But nothing has changed there.
binarybits	685157530394333185	2016-01-07T17:54:19	byersalex And it's easier to avoid installment payments by buying the phone outright or bringing a used phone to the carrier.
binarybits	685157441751879680	2016-01-07T17:53:58	byersalex Customers can still get installment plans if they want, but those costs are now an explicit item on their bill.
binarybits	685157123861430272	2016-01-07T17:52:42	byersalex And because cell phones are no longer subsidized, cell phone plans are cheaper.
binarybits	685156899474542592	2016-01-07T17:51:49	byersalex Now the cost of the phone is explicit and you have more choices in how to pay for it.
binarybits	685156818843217920	2016-01-07T17:51:29	byersalex That's why you had to accept a 2-year contract, to make sure cell phone companies could make back their money.
binarybits	685156745644261376	2016-01-07T17:51:12	byersalex Your $90/month cell phone plan might effectively be $70/month for the service plus $20/month for the phone.
binarybits	685156605936168960	2016-01-07T17:50:39	byersalex In the past, you'd often get a "free" cell phone that you really paid for through higher monthly fees.
binarybits	685156399626715137	2016-01-07T17:49:49	byersalex I don't think that's a good description of what has changed.

binarybits	684113605973901316	2016-01-04T20:46:08	trnsprttnst GabrielRossman I suspect there is a lot of room for improvement there but we will have to see.
binarybits	684113097917906945	2016-01-04T20:44:07	trnsprttnst GabrielRossman My guess is that once that option becomes available to less wealthy/urban people they'll feel the same way.
binarybits	684113006092021760	2016-01-04T20:43:45	trnsprttnst GabrielRossman Among rich urbanites not having a car (and taking taxis everywhere) is a status symbol.

binarybits	684112579795529729	2016-01-04T20:42:03	trnsprttnst GabrielRossman The question is whether people decide to buy new cars when the old ones wear out.
binarybits	684112526146179072	2016-01-04T20:41:51	trnsprttnst GabrielRossman So obviously people who own cars are likely to keep driving them.
binarybits	684112466289246208	2016-01-04T20:41:36	trnsprttnst GabrielRossman Right, but buying the car is really expensive!

binarybits	684111021619937281	2016-01-04T20:35:52	trnsprttnst GabrielRossman Oh sure. But that just means the transition would take 10-20 years.

binarybits	684097950239322112	2016-01-04T19:43:55	trnsprttnst GabrielRossman So for predictable trips there'd be no difference in wait times.
binarybits	684097786099412992	2016-01-04T19:43:16	trnsprttnst GabrielRossman Also: you could hail the car 5 or 10 minutes ahead of time and have it wait in your driveway.
binarybits	684096866045267968	2016-01-04T19:39:37	trnsprttnst GabrielRossman But obviously we won't know until the market actually develops.
binarybits	684096703046266880	2016-01-04T19:38:58	trnsprttnst GabrielRossman My prediction is that taking self-driving taxis everywhere will be a lot cheaper than owning a car.
binarybits	684096592752840705	2016-01-04T19:38:32	trnsprttnst GabrielRossman Yes, I think this depends a lot on the relative prices.

binarybits	684077869379760128	2016-01-04T18:24:08	M_Toney The idea is that people would need to own a car so they can put their carseats in it, hence rental can't become the dominant model.
