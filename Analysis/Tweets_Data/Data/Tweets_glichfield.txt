glichfield	684473782405316608	2016-01-05T20:37:21	15/ So if you put 10k-char tweets into a UI that spent 9 years evolving to serve 140-char tweets, it will not be a happy marriage.
glichfield	684473217164128257	2016-01-05T20:35:06	14/ Because Twitter’s ephemeral nature isn’t merely a function of tweets being short; it’s a function of the UI design short tweets led to

glichfield	684472098413240321	2016-01-05T20:30:39	11/ And the questions then are, (a) will the writer’s UI be good enough (at least as good as competing blogging platforms)
glichfield	684471843361796096	2016-01-05T20:29:38	10/ And the advantage of writing on Twitter will be one less step to then tweeting what you’ve written
glichfield	684471575404523522	2016-01-05T20:28:35	9/ But as a writer, you will now have another choice besides e.g. Medium, tumblr, or your own blog, namely, to write on Twitter
