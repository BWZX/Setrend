monteiro	711340377777655808	2016-03-19T23:55:36	29/ Get to know the people of color you're friends with/working with/investing in/advising. There's way more to the story than you realize.
monteiro	711340294487154688	2016-03-19T23:55:16	28/ Locent didn't start when I filed incorporation docs. It started 22 yrs ago when I was the only black kid in a class full of white kids.
monteiro	711340213805588480	2016-03-19T23:54:57	27/ So please, don't sweep race under the rug when you meet me. Talk to me about it. It'll help you understand why I'm going to succeed.
monteiro	711340137796337664	2016-03-19T23:54:39	26/ And for tech to move forward, these issues need to come out into the open. Not just for founders, but for everyone in the ecosystem
monteiro	711340054304542720	2016-03-19T23:54:19	25/ I always put my business first. But let's stop pretending like race isn't an issue. Subconscious bias is just as damaging as overt bias.
monteiro	711339949568602112	2016-03-19T23:53:54	24/ We had to overcome things that others in the exact same position didn't have to. That means with equal conditions, we'd be much further.
monteiro	711339850541047808	2016-03-19T23:53:31	23/ I'm not asking for handouts. I'm asking you to take all of this into account when you evaluate me and people like me.
monteiro	711339770215927808	2016-03-19T23:53:11	22/ But we shouldn't have to start businesses based on theses about minorities to get funded. I shouldn't have to think about this shit.
monteiro	711339676385214465	2016-03-19T23:52:49	21/ Tristan is one VCs would recognize. Michael Seibel doesn't get the credit he deserves. The men carry an enormous burden, make no mistake
monteiro	711339581300322305	2016-03-19T23:52:26	20/ I'm not saying it's impossible to succeed as a minority. There are a few beacons in our community who have done it at the highest level.
monteiro	711339482084036608	2016-03-19T23:52:03	19/ Bias cuts both ways man. Clearly I have a big chip on my shoulder. My mentors/investors are mostly white, so this stuff barely comes up.
monteiro	711339378300203008	2016-03-19T23:51:38	18/ Wanna know the real difference between them and me? I don't fit your pattern. You have no archetype for me. So the bar for me is higher.
monteiro	711339300449755140	2016-03-19T23:51:19	17/ And look at your fucking portfolio. You invested in a CEO whose only background is low level design. And an econ major fresh outta Cal.
monteiro	711339205125734401	2016-03-19T23:50:57	16/ Ha. Dude I went to Princeton. I got a JD/MBA from UCLA. I'm in YC. My pedigree speaks for itself. How can you question my business cred?
monteiro	711339108187054080	2016-03-19T23:50:34	15/ Want an example? 2 days ago an angel who a friend intro'd me to said he loved Locent, but didn't think I had 'elite business experience'
monteiro	711339009998389249	2016-03-19T23:50:10	14/ Because I've experienced enough clear bias to plant the seed in my mind everywhere I go. Not just me, most people of color in tech have.
monteiro	711338901789495296	2016-03-19T23:49:44	13/ What's fucked about all of this is that I know deep down there are legitimate reasons for you to not give me money. Doesn't matter.
monteiro	711338802971672576	2016-03-19T23:49:21	12/ Whether you realize or not, you pattern match me as well. But that's where stereotypes play in. Can you name 5 black CEOs w exits? 1?
monteiro	711338676286935042	2016-03-19T23:48:51	11/ Here's the thing dude-you invest in founders. You pattern match against other success you've seen. I don't look like Zuck or Butterfield
monteiro	711338567432167424	2016-03-19T23:48:25	10/ Some VC is gonna raise their hand and say 'I'm not racist, I don't care about where you came from, I just evaluate companies on merit'
monteiro	711338469205811201	2016-03-19T23:48:01	9/ What better evidence do you have of grit than traction in a product in the face of all of that? Think about it
monteiro	711338362678816768	2016-03-19T23:47:36	8/ VCs - that's a positive and you should find ways to factor that into your analysis. Being a founder is about doing the impossible.
monteiro	711338257934471168	2016-03-19T23:47:11	7/ To get anywhere as a minority in tech you have to be more resilient than those around you. That's a fact. We're held to a diff standard.
monteiro	711338129521684480	2016-03-19T23:46:40	6/ Yea I'm thinking about that last interaction I had when I meet you. And yea it fuels and motivates me day-to-day. It's a strength.
monteiro	711338015864426497	2016-03-19T23:46:13	5/ You think I don't know that I'm in rooms full of white/Asian men everywhere I go? That people don't openly question my qualifications?
monteiro	711337907223539712	2016-03-19T23:45:47	4/ On the founder side, esp in tech, race comes into everything we do. We succeed in spite of the biases that exist everywhere around us.
monteiro	711337760234143744	2016-03-19T23:45:12	3/ Why? On the VC side there's inevitable pressure to not be racist. 'He's no different than anyone else.' So you don't touch race/ethnicity
monteiro	711337655057784832	2016-03-19T23:44:47	2/ The fundraising process is definitely different for founders of color than it is for others. Both for the founders and VCs evaluating us.
monteiro	711337517862096896	2016-03-19T23:44:14	1/ Lemme see if I can break this down. I'm spending a lot of time with VCs heading into YC demo day and there's an elephant in the room.
