BathosMan	726117810364014593	2016-04-29T18:35:51	StephanieKelton he did  as far as his regs were "rule of law"   what he said is CB rate would dampen debt and pub sec inv offset recessions
BathosMan	726117614989262848	2016-04-29T18:35:04	StephanieKelton then the purpose of pub sec is not to try to design the flying carpet to eliminate animal spirits but to counterpoint
BathosMan	726117408352669696	2016-04-29T18:34:15	StephanieKelton so we agree    so no regulations which impede this, right?  but his bio of Keynes accepts animal spirits as a fact of life
BathosMan	726115839687168000	2016-04-29T18:28:01	StephanieKelton not my read - he always stressed that corporate profit was paramount    do you agree with that?
BathosMan	726114551796781056	2016-04-29T18:22:54	seems most misread Minsky dont get it he was fully mkt economy and that he thinks his cycles are unavoidable - his pub sec was to offset

BathosMan	710834941714685952	2016-03-18T14:27:11	My read is, and has been for well over a year now, Yellen is mendacious anti-democratic, contempt of Congress, and must be fired

BathosMan	710833761416568832	2016-03-18T14:22:30	By switching to "global" Yellen is insults Congressional oversight as per law, ending transparency, gouging swath out of Treasury and State
BathosMan	710833275615502337	2016-03-18T14:20:34	So how does Congress handle HH now when review of China's economic status is the main factor?

BathosMan	694886664729190400	2016-02-03T14:14:25	Based on Bismarck ideals (pretty conservative fellow)  health care was a conservative policy right 
BathosMan	694885292550045696	2016-02-03T14:08:58	If GOP adopted:  a) single payer health care b) immigration, green card for all grads US colleges amnesty,  5x  current level
