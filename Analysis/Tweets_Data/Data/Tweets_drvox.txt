drvox	723626336275714048	2016-04-22T21:35:37	drkorfhage One can learn something about policy by studying the political dynamics of support &amp; opposition.
drvox	723625529685889024	2016-04-22T21:32:25	Yes. Tho it's a sad truth of politics that distributional impacts matter less than *visible* distributional impacts. 
drvox	723624423584980992	2016-04-22T21:28:01	Yes. That's one of the two core, fundamental challenges facing a C tax in the real world.  
drvox	723621509550362624	2016-04-22T21:16:26	Yes! A carbon price could be $1 or $100. Making claims about what "a carbon tax" will do is a goofy game.

drvox	723581451376070657	2016-04-22T18:37:16	29. It's hard to "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" &amp; "act responsibly" even when you're healthy/well-rested/well-fed. When you're not?
drvox	723580961372295169	2016-04-22T18:35:19	28. It casts a very different light on all the lectures poor ppl are always receiving about what they should do/how they should behave.
drvox	723580639270707201	2016-04-22T18:34:02	27. Anyway, most ppl these days never have occasion to experience true hunger. Dunno if I would *recommend* it, but it is def. educational.
drvox	723579809066967040	2016-04-22T18:30:44	26. This is obvious, on some level, but feeling that dullness &amp; desperation &amp; weight, just a taste of it, really brought it home.
drvox	723579536206503937	2016-04-22T18:29:39	25. They say "it takes $ to make $." Conversely, not having money/food/social support/predictable income *feeds on itself*.
drvox	723579243381198848	2016-04-22T18:28:29	24. It made me appreciate, for the 1st time, the fact of being poor/hungry in &amp; of itself makes it more difficult to get un-poor, un-hungry.
drvox	723578890145263616	2016-04-22T18:27:05	23. Even in that bounded situation, which I knew would end, I had some *crazy* thoughts. Judgment completely muddled.
drvox	723578642198994944	2016-04-22T18:26:06	22. I stared at that caved-in, fuzzy melon for a long, long time. Picked it up. Put it down. Experienced a dark night of the soul.
drvox	723578224941223937	2016-04-22T18:24:26	21. At one point, I jimmied the lock of the neighboring cabin &amp; broke in. It was empty save one rotting, moldy cantaloupe in the fridge.
drvox	723577575352619008	2016-04-22T18:21:52	20. Indeed, I sat for several minutes in wonder, contemplating how humanity ever created anything so perfect as the Ruffles potato chip.
drvox	723577356854530048	2016-04-22T18:20:59	19. I thought then that if I could just eat a Ruffles potato chip, I would never again want or ask for anything, in my life.
drvox	723577179980746753	2016-04-22T18:20:17	18. The towering bag, falling to its side in slow motion, chips tumbling out, one over another, salt crystals flying, grease shimmering ...
drvox	723576908093378564	2016-04-22T18:19:12	17. My most vivid memory of the whole thing is watching a commercial for Ruffle potato chips on TV. I remember it so clearly!
drvox	723576763901612032	2016-04-22T18:18:38	16. Don't wanna be dramatic, but it affects your *soul*, your whole disposition &amp; worldview &amp; relish for life. Very hard to describe.
drvox	723576512738267136	2016-04-22T18:17:38	15. It's more than being physically weak, though there is that. It's impossible to think clearly. Everything is heavier, more dismal.
drvox	723576107006455809	2016-04-22T18:16:01	14. The day one hunger is one thing. The day two hunger is something else. And the day three hunger is REALLY something else.
drvox	723575941121773568	2016-04-22T18:15:22	13. What it feels like to be really, really, really hungry. It's not something easy to describe but I will never, ever forget it.
drvox	723575685537619968	2016-04-22T18:14:21	12. However, I did learn one simple thing, which not a lot of people (esp. in my cohort) understand, namely:
drvox	723575456105013248	2016-04-22T18:13:26	11. I didn't experience any of that. I knew when it would end &amp; had no doubt I'd be fed &amp; taken care of afterward.
drvox	723575285656899584	2016-04-22T18:12:46	10. Same w/ poverty, or menial work, or etc. Only partly about physical experience; mostly about stress, uncertainty, feeling trapped.
drvox	723575032278978560	2016-04-22T18:11:45	9. ... is only partly about hunger itself, and more about *uncertainty*, the grinding anxiety &amp; stress of not knowing what's coming.
drvox	723574770348920832	2016-04-22T18:10:43	8. Anyway, to be clear, I did *not* learn from this experience "what it's like to go hungry." In the real world, hunger ...
drvox	723574425237364736	2016-04-22T18:09:20	7. It sounds kinda crazy in retrospect, but at the time my bro &amp; I viewed it as kind of a fun adventure/experiment.
drvox	723574250699771904	2016-04-22T18:08:39	6. Anyway, the three of us rented a cabin in a nearby state park and went there for three days, to starve ourselves.
drvox	723574101357416448	2016-04-22T18:08:03	5. (Do not try this at home, folks. It's a dumb idea.)
drvox	723573999041552384	2016-04-22T18:07:39	4. The idea is that the fast completely empties your system. Then you introduce foods one at a time, to find out what you're allergic to.
drvox	723573793252249600	2016-04-22T18:06:50	3. So he came up with this plan: we would go on a fast. For 3 days, he, my older brother, and I would eat nothing, drink nothing but H2O.
drvox	723573509788585984	2016-04-22T18:05:42	2. ... that everyone in the modern world was allergic to various foods, and it explained various ailments &amp; bad behaviors.
drvox	723573359842226176	2016-04-22T18:05:06	1. When I was about 14 or 15, my dad got really caught up in the "food allergies" fad that was big at the time. He became convinced ...

drvox	723566470051991553	2016-04-22T17:37:44	Yeah, this is a good Q. If you set up a CO2 tax as a source of revenue...what happens when CO2 declines?

drvox	723565551855919104	2016-04-22T17:34:05	drkorfhage Yes. (Not assumption, though -- carbon taxes are "too low" everywhere they exist.)

drvox	723563077283647489	2016-04-22T17:24:15	gilbeaq The great puzzle, as always, is how to account for political economy in those kinds of comparisons.
drvox	723562444228988928	2016-04-22T17:21:44	Yes, but it's difficult to pass a C&amp;T like that for the very same reasons it's difficult to get the tax high enough.

drvox	722124794284494848	2016-04-18T18:09:02	8. More broadly, arguing against grandiose/doomed policy proposals is a political &amp; strategic argument, not a referendum on the proposals.
drvox	722124021819551744	2016-04-18T18:05:57	7. Arguing against taking a stand for a carbon tax is not the same as arguing against a carbon tax. The words are not the thing.

drvox	714913048222244864	2016-03-29T20:32:07	Again, characterizing the situation this way doesn't change it.  
drvox	714912575637495808	2016-03-29T20:30:15	Nope. I would vote for whichever one I deemed less odious. 
drvox	714912255284895744	2016-03-29T20:28:58	Nope. Encouraging 3rd parties (*at the federal level*) does virtually nothing to change the system. States, maybe.  
drvox	714911676298989568	2016-03-29T20:26:40	No. What condemns the US to a 2-party dynamic are the rules. No number of 3rd party votes will change the rules.  
drvox	714911429585801220	2016-03-29T20:25:41	Voting for a 3rd party *does not disrupt it*. At all. Not even a little.  
drvox	714910969072189440	2016-03-29T20:23:52	True!

drvox	714908554847649793	2016-03-29T20:14:16	20. So, fine, yell at the Hitlarybots who scold you. Condemn them all you like. But when yer done, the 2-party system is still there.
drvox	714908161287663616	2016-03-29T20:12:42	19. It just is what it is, pending fundamental (and unlikely) reform of the Constitution &amp; various electoral rules.
drvox	714907964457357313	2016-03-29T20:11:55	18. The (admittedly awful) 2-party system is not something anyone is *doing* to you. The people pointing it out are not *creating* it.
drvox	714907588786192385	2016-03-29T20:10:26	17. Identifying them as jerks &amp; sellouts -- even if true! -- in no way releases you from responsibility for the implications of your choice.
drvox	714907357763899392	2016-03-29T20:09:31	16. The fact that people criticizing you for your choice are jerks, or sellouts, or fake progressives, or whatever, is peripheral at best.
drvox	714907139223846912	2016-03-29T20:08:38	15. If you're contemplating a 3rd party vote, you need to grapple with the reality of the situation.
drvox	714906849200381952	2016-03-29T20:07:29	14. It would remain true even if no one ever said it. It would remain true even if everyone said the opposite!
drvox	714906636368744448	2016-03-29T20:06:39	13. How people talk about it, and their motivations, are orthogonal to the truth of the thing itself. It is what it is, feelings aside.
drvox	714906413407932416	2016-03-29T20:05:45	12. The (admittedly grim) choice between two evils is not primarily *a thing establishment libs say*. It is primarily *a thing*.
drvox	714906171706986496	2016-03-29T20:04:48	11. But if you condemn/refute/reject someone's motivations, it's not the same as refuting the content of their assertions.
drvox	714905899052113921	2016-03-29T20:03:43	10. And it may be true that those are accurate descriptions of people's motivations, in some cases.
drvox	714905736942202882	2016-03-29T20:03:04	9. Like, "yer forcing us to choose the lesser of two evils!" Or "yer trying to silence dissent!" Or "yer shilling for the establishment!"
drvox	714905447593979904	2016-03-29T20:01:55	8. Now, what puzzles me is that bernieorbust types (or Nader dead-enders), when they hear this, treat it as some sort of gambit.
drvox	714905295290413056	2016-03-29T20:01:19	7. Not huge -- it's only one vote! -- but some.
drvox	714905202508234752	2016-03-29T20:00:57	6. If you prefer 1 candidate of the 2, but vote for a 3rd, and your preferred candidate of the 2 loses, you have some responsibility.
drvox	714904632560979969	2016-03-29T19:58:41	5. That is, you're denying a vote to both candidates, expressing no preference.
drvox	714904405611446272	2016-03-29T19:57:47	4. If you vote for one candidate, you're exercising both powers. If you vote for a 3rd-party candidate, you're only exercising one.
drvox	714904185427202050	2016-03-29T19:56:54	3. As a voter, you effectively have two powers. You can give your vote to one candidate; you can deny a vote to the other candidate.
drvox	714903980971700224	2016-03-29T19:56:05	2. The US has a two-party system. There will be two viable candidates for president. One of them will win.

drvox	713835155727654912	2016-03-26T21:08:58	18. Is my position - "a certain amount of terrorism is a small price to pay for a free society" - really that fringe?
drvox	713834919516999680	2016-03-26T21:08:01	17. So, which is it? Is that really what the gov't is saying? And if so, do people really find that a reasonable position?
drvox	713834691757932544	2016-03-26T21:07:07	16. It's one of many debates where I feel like either I'm crazy or missing something ... or everyone else is crazy or missing something.
drvox	713834529186668544	2016-03-26T21:06:28	15. That seems batshit &amp; Orwellian to me, but ppl aren't treating it that way. Ppl are taking it seriously, stroking their chins, nodding.
drvox	713834139368038405	2016-03-26T21:04:55	14. In short, gov't's position on encryption seems to be: there can be no true privacy. Period. Because terrorism.
drvox	713833509886951424	2016-03-26T21:02:25	13. But communications that gov't has at-will access to are, by definition, not private, even if gov't is not currently listening.
drvox	713833198711476224	2016-03-26T21:01:11	12. Now, gov't says, "you can have private communications; we just need the *ability* to monitor you if necessary."
drvox	713832868275834880	2016-03-26T20:59:52	11. If you follow the logic, the conclusion is that citizens must be denied any truly private space, out of reach of the government.
drvox	713832659596632064	2016-03-26T20:59:03	10. Heck, any time you allow citizens to roam free, having unmonitored communications with one another, they could be plotting terrorism!
drvox	713832485352636417	2016-03-26T20:58:21	9. More to the point: the right to purchase firearms might be used by terrorists! (Odd you never hear conservatives use this one.)
drvox	713832220188762112	2016-03-26T20:57:18	8. Freedom of assembly might be used by terrorists! Terrorists might use the right against unlawful search, or self-incrimination!
drvox	713831928185491456	2016-03-26T20:56:08	7. But...this is madness. Could say the same about virtually any right or privilege of citizenship. Free speech might be used by terrorists!
drvox	713831534780764161	2016-03-26T20:54:34	6. Ipso facto, anything a citizen could use to protect their privacy, a terrorist could use to protect their privacy.
drvox	713831197122494464	2016-03-26T20:53:14	5. ... it follows that our goal must be to deny *any citizen* the means to keep communications/data private. Right?
drvox	713830924048146433	2016-03-26T20:52:09	4. So if our law enforcement goal is to deny terrorists any conceivable means of keeping data or communications private ...
drvox	713830514256252928	2016-03-26T20:50:31	3. Which is, as a matter of simple logic, true. If citizens can do X, then terrorists can do X, b/c (some) terrorists are citizens.
drvox	713830264686809088	2016-03-26T20:49:32	2. What I keep hearing is, if there's a way to keep data private (via encryption or any other means), then terrorists could use it.
drvox	713830105458409472	2016-03-26T20:48:54	1. I have not closely followed the debates over encryption, but if I am understanding the gov't's position correctly, it is horrifying.

drvox	707776207580860416	2016-03-10T03:52:52	I’d rather watch candidates do shot contests than debate at this point tbh
drvox	707776117457858560	2016-03-10T03:52:30	He’d definitely be a loud drunk.  
drvox	707776006665273344	2016-03-10T03:52:04	KevinRuprecht I’m afraid of how a night like that might end.
drvox	707775811189800960	2016-03-10T03:51:17	Ah, I forgot about him too! I can definitely see that.  
drvox	707774749779230720	2016-03-10T03:47:04	drvox having lived in VT for 20 yrs and seen both around town, would vastly prefer sharing a bev w/ bernie. dean not the sharpest dude.
drvox	707775130991087619	2016-03-10T03:48:35	No beer with B. Clinton for me. I get uncomfortable around ppl who are so good at manipulating me. Get paranoid. Don’t want a paranoid beer.
drvox	707774773049171968	2016-03-10T03:47:10	Oh, right, I forgot Biden! Obviously he’s on the top of any beer list.  
drvox	707774590697611266	2016-03-10T03:46:26	Actually polls show most people hate the dude.  
drvox	707773961308741632	2016-03-10T03:43:56	drvox Cruz would sneer at your crappy Bud Light as he sipped on a Stella
drvox	707774079697178625	2016-03-10T03:44:25	I always kind of wanted to get a beer with Dean.
drvox	707773498815488000	2016-03-10T03:42:06	This election will be odd in that no one will want to get a beer w/ either candidate. So how will they decide? 
drvox	707773249216589824	2016-03-10T03:41:07	dvdbllrd Nice.
drvox	707773190563434496	2016-03-10T03:40:53	Whaaat? Lordy no. Kasich maybe. Maybe even Rubio. But Cruz?  
drvox	707772421282004993	2016-03-10T03:37:49	I know, I agree it's endearing. He's a classic hedgehog.  
drvox	707771961812725760	2016-03-10T03:36:00	djsziff jonathanchait It's kind of a goofy debate; everyone agrees it's both.
drvox	707771130170376193	2016-03-10T03:32:41	Yeah, I hope it’s obvious I don’t think the "get a beer" metric is relevant at all, for anything. Just musing.   
drvox	707770602484961284	2016-03-10T03:30:36	Oh my god this. The Climate 101 question is the *best* we can hope for. God forbid we get into any details.  
drvox	707770024874749953	2016-03-10T03:28:18	"Hey Bernie, pass the pretzels."  "David, these pretzels are twisted like today’s campaign finance system …"
drvox	707769888710864896	2016-03-10T03:27:45	I honestly can’t tell if I’d like to get a beer w/ Sanders. Kinda seems like he’d be exactly the same way in literally any context.
drvox	707769707907014657	2016-03-10T03:27:02	djsziff jonathanchait Yeah, I’m not really sure either. I can’t help thinking that more socioeconomic stability would at least *help*.
drvox	707767639934898176	2016-03-10T03:18:49	Bernie's suit, explained: 
drvox	707768037143785472	2016-03-10T03:20:24	djsziff jonathanchait "Racism has its own life, outside of economic insecurity, and calls for its own remedies."
drvox	707766896599248896	2016-03-10T03:15:52	djsziff jonathanchait If you think it "ignores racism" I don’t know what to tell you.
drvox	707766244615696385	2016-03-10T03:13:17	Journalists who think "objectivity" requires neutrality on even the most obvious policy Qs … are happy to assert judgments of character.
drvox	707765462109532160	2016-03-10T03:10:10	titd_chris Put it this way: if he did more on it - as much as you wanted - would you care whether he was also authentic about it?
drvox	707762122394968064	2016-03-10T02:56:54	Lol, Hillary Clinton’s speaking fees are high—but only compared with other women   DemDebate
drvox	707764770691112960	2016-03-10T03:07:25	jeffspross root_e eliasisquith Yeah that’s basically what my post says. A little stability can’t help but help.
drvox	707764621646540802	2016-03-10T03:06:50	jjmck79 Twitter is definitely the best way to make that determination.
drvox	707764323779645440	2016-03-10T03:05:39	Uh way to bury the lede there. 
drvox	707762171153809409	2016-03-10T02:57:05	Clinton's "I'm not a natural politician" comment is a brilliant way to turn a weakness into a strength in the era of authenticity
drvox	707763837781422080	2016-03-10T03:03:43	12-D chess! 
drvox	707762305094713344	2016-03-10T02:57:37	I find H. Clinton’s awkwardness, the clumsiness of her machinations, oddly comforting. A better BS artist could hide it way better!
drvox	707761720861728768	2016-03-10T02:55:18	akpak29 A close second!
drvox	707761251535880192	2016-03-10T02:53:26	No, half of voters. NO ONE questions the authenticity of a politician who has come around to *their POV*.  
drvox	707760180583276544	2016-03-10T02:49:11	Even aside from politics, I just hate the notion of authenticity, of a "true self." Hate it like 5K-word thinkpiece hate it. Don’t make me.
drvox	707759695755218944	2016-03-10T02:47:15	Ha! 
drvox	707758827613990913	2016-03-10T02:43:48	chadstanton No, you have honed right in on the key question. I wish I had a good answer.
drvox	707758061906071552	2016-03-10T02:40:46	"Both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump really seem to have a penis about them."
drvox	707757968142405633	2016-03-10T02:40:23	We need a browser extension that automatically replaces certain words - authenticity, gravitas, likability - with "penis."
drvox	707757725057351680	2016-03-10T02:39:25	I mean honestly. TRUMP is "authentic"? The guy is a bullshit artist all the way down. I doubt there *is* a "real" Donald Trump.
drvox	707757240019783684	2016-03-10T02:37:30	There is no concept in all of political analysis more packed with bullshit than "authenticity." 
drvox	707746819392966656	2016-03-10T01:56:05	For the record, here’s the proper response to "the climate has always changed."

drvox	707746202708611075	2016-03-10T01:53:38	Love it when one of my rectally extracted theories is vouchsafed by an actual expert!  
drvox	707745577501495296	2016-03-10T01:51:09	Hopefully without kids.  
drvox	707744409937383424	2016-03-10T01:46:31	jonathanchait drvox  not nearly as good, but from on the ground.
drvox	707744586873974785	2016-03-10T01:47:13	chadstanton I hope you'll tag me or gather them somewhere or something.
drvox	707744401557094400	2016-03-10T01:46:29	djsziff jonathanchait  I know civil rights laws played a big part in the disruption (to the good, obv). How's that change my point?
drvox	707743696381292544	2016-03-10T01:43:41	A_H_Goldstein Not watching. Dare I ask?
drvox	707743629758955520	2016-03-10T01:43:25	jameshupp Well now you tell me.
drvox	707741345880907776	2016-03-10T01:34:20	This is very good and worth reading, especially if you fall prey to the temptation of cosmopolitan condescension  
drvox	707740647252316160	2016-03-10T01:31:34	jonathanchait Totally agreed. I had a whole paragraph about the unique perils of left-siders running things unopposed, but it got cut.
drvox	707740007893565440	2016-03-10T01:29:01	A_H_Goldstein Interesting. Still quite a bit of slack, but less than I thought.
drvox	707739350650503168	2016-03-10T01:26:25	ShitColtKnows More of a metaphorical day, really.
drvox	707738575110938624	2016-03-10T01:23:20	jonathanchait Thanks!
drvox	707736705206525953	2016-03-10T01:15:54	I love drvox's essay empathizing with the sentiments behind Trump's white working class supporters. More of this! 
drvox	707737763362148352	2016-03-10T01:20:06	Me, listlessly poking at potatoes in the oven: "How am I supposed to know if these are done?"  Huck (10): "Call mom."
drvox	707733972512452608	2016-03-10T01:05:02	What is the current ovary-penis conversion rate? Gotta compare apples to apples. If you will.  
drvox	707733586607087616	2016-03-10T01:03:30	KHayhoe We are clearly not signed up to the right mailing lists.
drvox	707733010083254272	2016-03-10T01:01:13	A_H_Goldstein There's an NREL study I'd like to see.
drvox	707732563687682048	2016-03-10T00:59:26	A_H_Goldstein Do you know the CF of the former off the top of your head? Not sure if EIA disaggregates.
drvox	707731763607396352	2016-03-10T00:56:16	A_H_Goldstein So, question then. Current US NG fleet running at about 26% CF. Couldn't we phase out a ton of coal just w/ slack capacity?
drvox	707730397593874432	2016-03-10T00:50:50	Still haven't wrapped my head around this. Mr. Gyros too! 
drvox	707730117863190528	2016-03-10T00:49:43	omg are you serious another debate tonight
drvox	707727738833080324	2016-03-10T00:40:16	Oh. I now understand America better. Thanks drvox! 
drvox	707729262715908096	2016-03-10T00:46:19	A_H_Goldstein Ah, so the idea is, switch end uses to electric, reserve NG for central station power, thus reduce CH4 leakage?
drvox	707728973602512897	2016-03-10T00:45:10	He would make Exxon pay for it.  
drvox	707727463665668097	2016-03-10T00:39:10	AneeceColt Oh carbon capture machines won't produce energy. They will consume gargantuan amounts!
drvox	707727138829406208	2016-03-10T00:37:53	RabagoEnergy So it factors in flexibility? Ancillary services? That kind of thing?
drvox	707726862093422593	2016-03-10T00:36:47	That's my story and I'm stickin' to it.  
drvox	707726182905552897	2016-03-10T00:34:05	Possible some such tech may materialize. Commercialize, even. But match the scale of coal/oil emissions? No. Zero.  
drvox	707723450912251905	2016-03-10T00:23:14	drvox These techs can only do so much... Negative Emissions Technologies and Stranded Carbon Assets 
drvox	707725014452215808	2016-03-10T00:29:26	Our best hope is to eliminate fossil fuels &amp; then use such techs to go carbon negative.  
drvox	707724775754305536	2016-03-10T00:28:30	There is zero prospect of any CO2-capture tech w/ the scale/cost to allow us to continue burning fossil fuels.  
drvox	707724346890932225	2016-03-10T00:26:47	Like this a lot! 
drvox	707723942920790016	2016-03-10T00:25:11	Yes. Makes for healthier soil, too.  
drvox	707723762695704577	2016-03-10T00:24:28	But if we did it, yeah, it would me phasing out natural gas as rapidly as possible, i.e., no more fracking.
drvox	707723573859713024	2016-03-10T00:23:43	I leave it to you to assess the likelihood thereof.
drvox	707723266169802753	2016-03-10T00:22:30	Actually hitting the climate targets we agreed to in Paris would mean immediate &amp; sustained wartime-level mobilization, globally.
drvox	707722741533638656	2016-03-10T00:20:25	A_H_Goldstein MikeGrunwald You lost me there. Now do NG power plants work without the distribution network?
drvox	707722414050807808	2016-03-10T00:19:07	Yes, we call them "forests" and they are a huge part of the solution.  
drvox	707721973971877888	2016-03-10T00:17:22	RabagoEnergy Well what the heck is that?
drvox	707721703464443904	2016-03-10T00:16:17	Wasn't she one of the moderates? It's all so hard to keep straight these days.  
drvox	707720893867237376	2016-03-10T00:13:04	Well, we need to get to zero carbon by 2050 latest. By definition that would mean zero fracking.  
drvox	707713268681342976	2016-03-09T23:42:46	This was the best thing I read all week 
drvox	707712184281747456	2016-03-09T23:38:28	pat_coveney Thanks!
drvox	707711937967067136	2016-03-09T23:37:29	I read a lot of political analysis. Too much, probably, as Leah_Rebekah can attest. This is the best this cycle —&gt;

drvox	707389557101047809	2016-03-09T02:16:27	Strong post from fellow Tennessean drvox on decline of white working class--and what to do about it  
drvox	707390532922658817	2016-03-09T02:20:20	masonhastie A few, though not many. Naturally eager to hear what everyone thinks.
drvox	707389028715237376	2016-03-09T02:14:21	Damn, that is stark.

drvox	707386721151819777	2016-03-09T02:05:11	Good lord.  
drvox	707354212783489027	2016-03-08T23:56:00	This is one of the most rational, calmly reasoned articles I've read this election season. H/t drvox &amp; petersagal

drvox	707329275876081664	2016-03-08T22:16:55	The Republican establishment just assumed that GOP voters would insist on adherence to conventional large-hands conservatism. Wrong again.
drvox	707328420351356928	2016-03-08T22:13:31	So good.  
drvox	707327705604169728	2016-03-08T22:10:41	There’s a hand-size joke in here somewhere ... 
drvox	707327092354994176	2016-03-08T22:08:14	Any word on hand size? 
drvox	707323158735360000	2016-03-08T21:52:37	Yessss! So glad this has a name.  
drvox	707323004431151104	2016-03-08T21:52:00	johnffarrell Just keep replying to the previous one. Thought that was standard practice.
drvox	707322660103921664	2016-03-08T21:50:38	Changing the material circumstances of the white working class will do more to change their attitudes than any amount of "messaging."
drvox	707313951151763456	2016-03-08T21:16:01	Read this.  Note the respect and the honest attempt to understand. More of this would be good.

drvox	707308570514030592	2016-03-08T20:54:39	drvox Part of answer in ProfHansNoel book: writing like yours plays a role, at least in shaping tribes' evolution: 
drvox	707308277441232896	2016-03-08T20:53:29	What is that way, exactly? Is there one that's proven to work?

drvox	707296630450495488	2016-03-08T20:07:12	I think drvox nails it here. Yearning for the Golden Age that only existed for them.  
drvox	707296561428967424	2016-03-08T20:06:55	This is a very good article. You should read it.

drvox	707297187189776384	2016-03-08T20:09:25	hilzoy Obviously being a university town rather than a manufacturing town makes a huge diff.
drvox	707297028095610880	2016-03-08T20:08:47	Why are the words "so your view is that" so rarely followed by my view?  
drvox	707296484824199168	2016-03-08T20:06:37	I don't doubt that GOP *pols* hate universal benefit programs, for obvious reasons. Wonder about voters though.

drvox	707290545060585472	2016-03-08T19:43:01	It works! 
drvox	707290208731942912	2016-03-08T19:41:41	cruickshank ddayen Is the idea that wage stagnation makes the working class more open to the GOP's racist appeals?
drvox	707290102012076032	2016-03-08T19:41:15	cruickshank ddayen The "wage stagnation is pushing GOP to triumph" thing is oft-stated, rarely defended. Not sure I get the mechanism.

drvox	707289313164152833	2016-03-08T19:38:07	ddayen Of course we agree on that. Question, as ever, is what O could have done in the face of total opposition from Congress.

drvox	707282124446027776	2016-03-08T19:09:33	I recommend drvox's stuff all the time, but this piece truly is something special: 
drvox	707287598574624768	2016-03-08T19:31:18	Reviews are mixed.
drvox	707281974939901952	2016-03-08T19:08:58	Probably the most condescending fucker on this website. 
drvox	707281908279840769	2016-03-08T19:08:42	The beginning of a truly cogent and compelling tweet storm from the ever interesting drvox 
drvox	707286676670812160	2016-03-08T19:27:39	Turns out marcambinder is making points similar to mine &amp; jeffspross’s.

drvox	707285135771590656	2016-03-08T19:21:31	murphy1 Thanks man!
drvox	707279879507578883	2016-03-08T19:00:38	DaveMazella drvox Def ways Obama can be criticized. Just not clear how/if diff choices by him would've mattered. 
drvox	707284815301574656	2016-03-08T19:20:15	ddayen I know you're just gassing me, but yes, things could have gone WAY worse than that!
drvox	707284643716829189	2016-03-08T19:19:34	This is one of the more plausible critical counterfactuals. At least it doesn't rely on Obama having magic powers. 
drvox	707284261888339968	2016-03-08T19:18:03	Yeah, though as we've discussed, there were way too many wanky traditionalist Dems in the Senate for that to happen. 
drvox	707284071294980096	2016-03-08T19:17:17	I've thought about this a lot over the years. Conclusion: it would been a disaster. Neither would have passed.  
drvox	707283858488569856	2016-03-08T19:16:27	@MarieWolls kimmaytube Pretty sure white people can survive a little mockery. I believe they are due.
drvox	707278067312500737	2016-03-08T18:53:26	I don't normally characterize a piece as "wise." This piece is wise.  
drvox	707277450498195457	2016-03-08T18:50:59	.drvox Right. Instructive to remember Rick Santelli's Tea Party rant, on 2/19/09, Day 30 of the Obama Presidency, blaming all ills on him
drvox	707283230156689408	2016-03-08T19:13:57	As if "job training" isn't the most pathetic, brain-dead-DC response to a demand-side recession anyway.  
drvox	707280967111540736	2016-03-08T19:04:57	17. Long story short, when it comes to politics, don't forget things could be way worse! &lt;/fin&gt;
drvox	707280836362526720	2016-03-08T19:04:26	16. ... avoiding disasters is perhaps the top priority. "No drama." "Don't do stupid shit." --&gt; Uninspiring but v.v. important strategies.
drvox	707280492882571264	2016-03-08T19:03:04	15. ... to give credit to people &amp; institutions for things that didn't happen. But given the state of the US, and US politics, today ...
drvox	707280282953515008	2016-03-08T19:02:14	14. ... to also spend some time contemplating the many, many, MANY ways things could have gone worse. Human nature makes it difficult ...
drvox	707280100597731328	2016-03-08T19:01:31	13. More generally, it's a plea to all those who base their political critiques on happy counter-factuals where everything turns out ok...
drvox	707279833840005121	2016-03-08T19:00:27	12. But it is an argument that, *relative to the balance of risks he inherited*, he's navigated it way better than most would have.
drvox	707279604470272000	2016-03-08T18:59:32	11. This is not (I hope it's obvious) an argument that Obama did everything perfectly, or as well as it could be done.
drvox	707279432919044096	2016-03-08T18:58:52	10. Now the recovery is well underway, number if uninsured is dropping, rise of healthcare costs slowing, clean energy taking off, etc.
drvox	707279217805758464	2016-03-08T18:58:00	9. You could go on for days. Obama walked into a *minefield* in 2008 and tiptoed through it w/out any major disasters or scandals.
drvox	707279040709660673	2016-03-08T18:57:18	8. Stimulus blocked or further shrunk. Recession becomes massive depression. Obamacare blocked, health costs keep climbing.
drvox	707278815588798464	2016-03-08T18:56:24	7. So give a little thought, then, to all the ways things could have gone WAY WORSE during the Obama years.
drvox	707278589423517696	2016-03-08T18:55:30	6. … are bad! It is, quite simply, a miracle when anything good happens at the federal level in the US.
drvox	707278427871522816	2016-03-08T18:54:52	5. After all, in US politics gridlock &amp; dysfunction are the norm. So when anything good happens, MOST of the counter-factual alternatives …
drvox	707278252079878144	2016-03-08T18:54:10	4. But here’s the thing. If you want to talk counter-factuals, you also need to consider all the many ways things could have gone WORSE.
drvox	707278097914023936	2016-03-08T18:53:33	3. This is by FAR the preferred method of criticizing Obama. Could have gotten bigger stimulus, could have gotten GOP cooperation, etc.
drvox	707277901402509312	2016-03-08T18:52:46	2. Critics of politicians are always basing their critiques on counter-factuals: "things would have been better if s/he had done X."
drvox	707277640596627457	2016-03-08T18:51:44	1. There’s an odd bias in political analysis, especially amateur political analysis.
drvox	707277370357522432	2016-03-08T18:50:40	DaveMazella jeffspross What could/should he have done?
