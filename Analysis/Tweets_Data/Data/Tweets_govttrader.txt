govttrader	720965138312994816	2016-04-15T13:20:58	InterestArb btenharmsel1  And if a PD offers those 500mm 30yr bonds on the screws..its almost impossible not to lose money on the trade.

govttrader	720962078064963584	2016-04-15T13:08:48	The CBOT, BTEC and eSpeed can stream their tick data into a Fed database in real-time for analysis (with identity info) very easily.
govttrader	720962031805931521	2016-04-15T13:08:37	The complaints about US Treasury trading transparency are silly...because its an easy problem to solve.

govttrader	719945987247206401	2016-04-12T17:51:13	bmiller22 i think EFR is basis trade between a swap and futures contract.
govttrader	719945354435817472	2016-04-12T17:48:43	bmiller22 and that trade was not reported on the CBOT block trades website

govttrader	707661826205597705	2016-03-09T20:18:21	One of the guys asks "going down?" as one does..social grace and all...and then the pissed girl starts cussing him out again.
govttrader	707661514820493312	2016-03-09T20:17:07	So anyway, maybe 30min later we are leaving, getting in the elevator, and out of nowhere, there is HF almost stepping into the elevator.
govttrader	707661246330507264	2016-03-09T20:16:03	The hotel matre'd then positioned himself inbetween our group and HF...there was tension in the air for a few minutes.
govttrader	707660974074023936	2016-03-09T20:14:58	We were a good 60 feet away, but the girls were not quiet about it.
govttrader	707660786789949440	2016-03-09T20:14:13	Then it got ugly...one of the girls was super pissed (i don't think appropriate, but i'm not a chick)...and she started to cuss him out.
govttrader	707658498318966785	2016-03-09T20:05:08	At that moment, the girls feelings changed from "in love" w/ HF, to "i hate him"  How quickly does a girl's feelings change...
govttrader	707658329347194880	2016-03-09T20:04:28	His response was "i'm sorry but no...if i say yes, then everybody else will want one"
govttrader	707658007447019526	2016-03-09T20:03:11	However, when they approached him and said "Hi Harrison...we don't mean to bother you, but could we take a picture with you?"
govttrader	707657856217174016	2016-03-09T20:02:35	At that moment, the girls were excited, and very much feeling good about meeting Harrison Ford
govttrader	707657708510564353	2016-03-09T20:02:00	Was with a couple girls the other night when we saw Harrison Ford at the hotel bar alone having a drink.  Girls wanted to go over say hi.

govttrader	707596118973087744	2016-03-09T15:57:15	talktoskirt i thought with Tinder...you are only matching with guys you find attractive..shouldn't that solve that problem?

govttrader	701187016252375044	2016-02-20T23:29:46	This is why Income Based Repayment makes so much sense...banks will be incentivized to be more careful.
govttrader	701186812199440384	2016-02-20T23:28:58	However, these outliers are an undue hardship. Students naively took on too much debt, and banks should have known better.  Sound Familiar?

govttrader	701113997383376896	2016-02-20T18:39:37	BondsFx Since this program is predicated on Income, any loan balances that are forgiven are based on "too low" income.

govttrader	689518427833262081	2016-01-19T18:42:58	SusanCTShore nanexllc  this is because both BrokerTec and eSpeed have their servers in JerseyCity...there is no tech speed advantage.
govttrader	689517986105917440	2016-01-19T18:41:13	SusanCTShore nanexllc  in the equity market, you can't buy or sell all the "liquidity" that you see...but in the treasury market...you can
govttrader	689517722955321345	2016-01-19T18:40:10	SusanCTShore nanexllc  anybody can see that offer for 50mm 10yr notes and lift it.  So the HFT game of 20 exchanges doesn't exist.
govttrader	689517443648221184	2016-01-19T18:39:03	SusanCTShore nanexllc  its not the same in the treasury market...because everybody has access to the same limit order book.
govttrader	689514457660268544	2016-01-19T18:27:11	SusanCTShore nanexllc  its too much effort for the govt to care...with too little benefit.  So long as we don't have flash crashes...
govttrader	689513109174784001	2016-01-19T18:21:50	nanexllc so long as the market operates "normal" the govt hasn't been interested in seeing the micro structure.
govttrader	689512669192327168	2016-01-19T18:20:05	nanexllc We are talking about the secondary mkt..the primary market is the actual auction process..which is what they normally care about.
govttrader	689512345815650304	2016-01-19T18:18:48	nanexllc The Fed/Treasury can get access to it if they want it.  Recall the flash crash back in October...they went thru the data.
govttrader	689512110204788741	2016-01-19T18:17:52	nanexllc seeing flashes of volume should not be the only reason you buy or sell...so i don't understand why this matters.
govttrader	689511571605831680	2016-01-19T18:15:43	nanexllc the US Treasury is talking about BrokerTec and eSpeed...cash treasuries..not futures...
govttrader	689510446492225536	2016-01-19T18:11:15	nanexllc there is no economic benefit to lifting your own offer..or hitting your own bid.
govttrader	689510250219737088	2016-01-19T18:10:28	nanexllc this happens sometimes by accident..if you are on both the bid and offer..trying to be a market maker.  then you decide to aggress

govttrader	687640153578409985	2016-01-14T14:19:23	chigrl CJMendes  we don't need to know "who is long" or "who is short".  This fact is irrelevant.
govttrader	687639652388438016	2016-01-14T14:17:23	CJMendes chigrl  open interest of 1k =  1k longs 1k shorts This is the definition
govttrader	687637727274242048	2016-01-14T14:09:44	.CJMendes chigrl  The short option position doesn't have to double down to force his options to pay out....the long does. This is skewed.

govttrader	687637317297782784	2016-01-14T14:08:06	.tweetstar10 chigrl  the short option position always has the larger vested interest in manipulating the px...because of expiration.
govttrader	687636952942772224	2016-01-14T14:06:39	chigrl if the buyers "forced" the contracts "into the money" they would be doubling (or more) their position in so doing. But not the short
govttrader	687636579792334849	2016-01-14T14:05:10	Looks like the $30 option position has been reduced to 13k contracts...still looks like it will be defended.

govttrader	687635837778063361	2016-01-14T14:02:14	Since we know that over 60% of trading volume is HFT....this $30 option position represents ~ 10% of avg daily human trading volume.

govttrader	687353063137525760	2016-01-13T19:18:35	Assuming ES doesn't do a complete break today...the mkt has established a zone (1890~ish) where a morning break will induce panic selling.
govttrader	687337893094895619	2016-01-13T18:18:18	29.86 is the next place i'd expect CL to make a local bottom where the dealers would defend and push it back up to 30.50

govttrader	687323480816238592	2016-01-13T17:21:02	i suspect that the $30 CL Put dealer has been trading his defense pretty well.  Buy CL below 30.25 Sell CL above 30.60  Ammo to defend...

govttrader	687296882918449152	2016-01-13T15:35:20	Will those $30 CL Put dealers defend $30 again?   Cuz we're about to find out...
govttrader	687288108551901185	2016-01-13T15:00:28	Since ES and CL are tied at the hip...and ZN is pretty highly correlated to ES...we are all one big happy family... 
govttrader	687286723395633152	2016-01-13T14:54:58	If i'm right about those $30 Put CL dealers defending their position, then ES is safe from another plunge until Friday at the least...

govttrader	686593338485686272	2016-01-11T16:59:42	GEQSense  i understand...but its the principle...you teach people how to treat you from Day 1.  Same goes for kids.
govttrader	686592779108093952	2016-01-11T16:57:29	GEQSense  but to be honest, this is something that you need to establish from day 1. By now, you've already established your patterns.
govttrader	686590826437316608	2016-01-11T16:49:43	GEQSense  no, its more mental than that.  You teach people how to act by setting your standards and enforcing them.
govttrader	686590149816369152	2016-01-11T16:47:02	GEQSense  You should read this book...will teach you how to do an "attitude adjustment"

govttrader	686326105339461632	2016-01-10T23:17:49	Just a reminder...the ES mkt coiled, and is in the process of releasing.  ES @ 1800-1850 is not very far away.

govttrader	686303051746009088	2016-01-10T21:46:13	Regarding my iCam idea...imagine the family vacation...having a hands-free body-cam video camera would have mass appeal.
govttrader	686284941932544000	2016-01-10T20:34:15	inner_scorecard  But Apple already makes the iCam.  This is just a better version...hands free, real-time streaming + a comm device.
govttrader	686283062125137921	2016-01-10T20:26:47	J_Otto8  i like WPC on a dip 
govttrader	686273413095231488	2016-01-10T19:48:26	PAntompietri down around 18 i'd be interested....
govttrader	686271473988796416	2016-01-10T19:40:44	OrionLabs i have a few other ideas...reach out and let me know if you are interested.
govttrader	686268559153037314	2016-01-10T19:29:09	PAntompietri too early.  These will still go lower.  Maybe in another 3-6 months.
govttrader	686268325396103169	2016-01-10T19:28:13	OrionLabs So, just for the Paramedics market, you are looking at potentially 20mm in Revenue, and they are easy to find (via Hospitals).
govttrader	686267876504932352	2016-01-10T19:26:26	OrionLabs if you can sell 100k units @ $99 to this market, that is 10mm in revenue.  You can probably double that for the worldwide market.
govttrader	686267378515218433	2016-01-10T19:24:27	OrionLabs There are 240,000 Paramedics in the US alone. They could all use a hands-free real-time streaming video comm device.  Your market
govttrader	686263812782206976	2016-01-10T19:10:17	I'm dropping gold here...too many ideas for me to do them all myself...
govttrader	686263575166480384	2016-01-10T19:09:21	OrionLabs You just need to make the device a little smaller and less conspicuous...
govttrader	686263306873626624	2016-01-10T19:08:17	OrionLabs Hands Free live-streaming video (just imagine Onyx live streaming via twitter's Periscope) Would boost your sales exponentially.
govttrader	686262894393208832	2016-01-10T19:06:38	OrionLabs Paramedics are a great use case, because they need the device to operate hands free when on the scene of an emergency.
govttrader	686262364912660480	2016-01-10T19:04:32	OrionLabs often times, the hospital is unaware of incoming emergency patients, because they are busy, and not staffed to be prepped 100%
govttrader	686262162021552128	2016-01-10T19:03:44	OrionLabs This could absolutely save lives when minutes count.  Right now, communication between Paramedics and local hospital is garbage.
govttrader	686261840549130240	2016-01-10T19:02:27	OrionLabs Doctors from the hospital (or any central location) could advise the Paramedics on scene...and prep for patient arrival.
govttrader	686261595241070593	2016-01-10T19:01:29	OrionLabs If Onyx had a streaming video camera, Paramedics could live stream the emergency scene back to local hospital.
govttrader	686261087625457664	2016-01-10T18:59:28	OrionLabs you guys should add a streaming video camera to Onyx...the consumer market needs a hands free body camera.  Paramedics, ect..
govttrader	686260295434694656	2016-01-10T18:56:19	WillardOfOdds i found a company that is making the hands free comm device...but audio only...no video. 
govttrader	686257914101784576	2016-01-10T18:46:51	If ES trades down to 1800/1850 next week...there will be diversified REIT stocks that you can buy with a 7% dividend.
govttrader	686257085370232832	2016-01-10T18:43:33	More conservative investment idea...diversified REIT stocks that pay high dividends. If the mkt tanks next week, can buy these on the cheap.
govttrader	686256328969449473	2016-01-10T18:40:33	WillardOfOdds would be a great kickstarter project.  But just like the Pebble Watch..if it is successful, Apple would dominate it after.
govttrader	686256088413503488	2016-01-10T18:39:36	WillardOfOdds did a little research and found that Apple has all the patents they need to build this...they just haven't yet.
govttrader	686255865150611458	2016-01-10T18:38:42	WillardOfOdds  no, i'm not an electrical engineer...just had the idea and wondered "why doesn't this exist?"
govttrader	686255411054383105	2016-01-10T18:36:54	Paramedics absolutely need to have this.
govttrader	686255186323615744	2016-01-10T18:36:01	Its time to bring this tech to the consumer...
govttrader	686255081734434817	2016-01-10T18:35:36	We already have a popular iCam use case...US soldiers on the battlefield wear streaming cameras, so that command can see the battlefield.
govttrader	686254650354495490	2016-01-10T18:33:53	Why hasn't Apple already built the iCam body camera?  Probably too busy counting their cash...
govttrader	686254154365403136	2016-01-10T18:31:55	Apple already has all the patents and knowledge they need to build this tech.  Otherwise, i wouldn't be posting this onto twitter.
govttrader	686253758649602049	2016-01-10T18:30:20	EquityGlobal having to wear the video camera on your face is just too intrusive.
govttrader	686253436174757888	2016-01-10T18:29:03	EquityGlobal  i mean the StarTrek lapel badge which was a hands free comm device.  Just add a video camera.
govttrader	686253151163428864	2016-01-10T18:27:55	The Apple Watch doesn't give you much capability that the iPhone doesn't already provide, and yet people are buying millions of these things
govttrader	686252323857952769	2016-01-10T18:24:38	Apple already has an iCam...but its just a handheld camcorder.  The hands-free wireless iCam bodycamera is the next gen consumer product.
govttrader	686252006793711616	2016-01-10T18:23:23	Google glass was a great idea...but the world just wasn't / isn't ready for the experience to be so "in your face".
govttrader	686251673342324736	2016-01-10T18:22:03	Teachers wearing an iCam in school can stream their class to parents.
govttrader	686251468383457281	2016-01-10T18:21:14	Paramedic on scene wearing an iCam can stream the scene back to their local hospital in realtime, and hands free.
govttrader	686251226133053440	2016-01-10T18:20:16	The growth of both Periscope and Police body cameras proves that there is a market for this iCam device.
govttrader	686251031106314241	2016-01-10T18:19:30	Unlike Google Glass...the iCam will not be "in your face" and so there will be less perceived intrusiveness into daily life.
govttrader	686250775576752128	2016-01-10T18:18:29	Parent wants to see what's happening at kids school?  No problem...just remote access the kids iCam.
govttrader	686250736783605760	2016-01-10T18:18:20	The user will wear the iCam just like they did in StarTrek...a clip-on lapel badge.
govttrader	686250445782806532	2016-01-10T18:17:10	The iCam will connect wirelessly to your iPhone, and can stream audio/video in realtime (sortof like Periscope).
govttrader	686250102177042433	2016-01-10T18:15:48	Billion dollar idea...the Apple BodyCam...called the iCam.  A cross between a bodycamera and the StarTrek comm device.

govttrader	685615289959100416	2016-01-09T00:13:17	50% seems to be the magic number.  If you buy a 50% retrace...then hold for 7 years...then go to cash, then buy 50% retrace...you win.
