annehelen	715201357095940096	2016-03-30T15:37:45	Nicole_Cliffe i think it's a question of safety: from the posture of the present, you can say "that was so horrible, we're better now"

annehelen	715197887857078272	2016-03-30T15:23:58	Nicole_Cliffe i think it's important to remember there are actual humans behind celeb images, but they are also IMAGES that i'm analyzing

annehelen	715197022333087744	2016-03-30T15:20:32	davechensky they're responding to my recent analysis of Ben Affleck's image: 
annehelen	715196885380636673	2016-03-30T15:19:59	...seems akin to a general reticence to think through the different ideological strains currently shaping our behavior.
annehelen	715196624469766145	2016-03-30T15:18:57	Celebrity images are one of the most potent ways to think through/interrogate ideologies; to wait to analyze from the comfort of the future
annehelen	715196267987505152	2016-03-30T15:17:32	and I get it: it's hard not to feel complicit, post-Britney, for what media attention does to actual humans. and yet!
annehelen	715196031093252096	2016-03-30T15:16:36	this, from the comments of The Toast, seems to be a semi-common reaction to analyzing contemporary celeb images

annehelen	714860931805675522	2016-03-29T17:05:02	EarthVsSoup yes; absolutely
annehelen	714860617824206848	2016-03-29T17:03:47	ira I also watched a LOT of classic SNL that way — years before I ever saw the "real" thing (which was on too late!)
annehelen	714860338257141760	2016-03-29T17:02:40	ira precisely; why isn't my entire feed fav-ing these Patty Duke tweets?
annehelen	714860240039088128	2016-03-29T17:02:17	Also imagine my surprise the first time I saw Fred MacMurray in DOUBLE INDEMNITY
annehelen	714860003216101377	2016-03-29T17:01:20	Nick at Nite totally messed up my perception of what shows were actually popular; I thought My 3 Sons and Patty Duke Show were TOPS

annehelen	714836747650109442	2016-03-29T15:28:56	TriciaLockwood it falls apart, too, w/Melania; her poor English skills make it so he has to keep repeating her intelligence til it's true

annehelen	700753387827159041	2016-02-19T18:46:41	anyway, all of this prompted by the sheer number of BuzzFeed posts today celebrating Harper Lee, which perfectly target our audience
annehelen	700753106385002496	2016-02-19T18:45:34	there's also less shame for teachers showing the film version of Mockingbird, because it's black and white and thus "serious"

annehelen	700752424441659392	2016-02-19T18:42:51	which, in turn, makes students believe that all literary analysis is hackneyed and dumb

annehelen	700752178512797697	2016-02-19T18:41:53	the only rival to Mockingbird, in terms of national curriculum standardization, is Gatsby, which is a horrible book to teach in high school
