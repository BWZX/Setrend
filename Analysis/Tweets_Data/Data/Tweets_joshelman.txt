joshelman	721768996903649280	2016-04-17T18:35:13	johnolilly semil dcurtis sure I was responding to Dustin's original premise
joshelman	721768390893838336	2016-04-17T18:32:48	semil dcurtis ideally not invest in something before you understand it, and hopefully stay in touch or formally walk away
joshelman	721768171783368704	2016-04-17T18:31:56	sbermo semil dcurtis highly doubt it was millions, but fair to say even one person is not ok when messing with health
joshelman	721766997755756544	2016-04-17T18:27:16	semil dcurtis sure - but when is it "off the rails"? They are still trying to build the science and make it work
joshelman	721766425770078216	2016-04-17T18:25:00	semil dcurtis but if it had worked...The mistake I think was anyone thinking a private valuation was equivalent to a real business
joshelman	721765897682034688	2016-04-17T18:22:54	dcurtis semil or just is the chance at something great worthy of a bet even if it fails?

joshelman	721183493103816704	2016-04-16T03:48:38	mgsiegler semil thing is that is going to happen anyway unless they can really shift the model to users paying for good journalism

joshelman	719373045496832000	2016-04-11T03:54:34	bermanjeff people visit profiles a lot to view the recent stream of someone all together. Both people you follow and those you don't
joshelman	719372960444715008	2016-04-11T03:54:13	bermanjeff if that is the use case, Twitter should put more into description area then. An old tweet just looks lame.
joshelman	719372112582946816	2016-04-11T03:50:51	bermanjeff the idea wasn't for everyone to pin something permanent but more recently important than the stream of tweets. Otherwise stale
joshelman	719361075045502976	2016-04-11T03:07:00	One early idea for pinned tweets was to make them 140 hours - which is about 6 days. a little cheesy but expiring weekly seemed right
joshelman	719358813971742721	2016-04-11T02:58:00	miketempleton very common for people to view profiles.
joshelman	719358381622829057	2016-04-11T02:56:17	miketempleton my initial suggestion was 140 hours (approximately 6 days)
joshelman	719358056769781760	2016-04-11T02:55:00	miketempleton even more reason to bring people back on some frequency
joshelman	719354918033707009	2016-04-11T02:42:32	jw yeah probs. Hopefully he doesn't come back strong when it matters
joshelman	719354212107177986	2016-04-11T02:39:43	Congrats Warriors! 72 wins is amazing. Should they get an asterisk since Tim Duncan didn't play?
joshelman	719353038251503617	2016-04-11T02:35:03	joshelman this is what separates Twitter from Facebook execution wise üòè 
joshelman	719352350507315200	2016-04-11T02:32:19	Twitter should change pinned tweets to have an expiration date. I see too many pinned tweets that are a link to Snapchat or other profiles

joshelman	718983310047744000	2016-04-10T02:05:53	chamath Twitter has self inflicted wounds by now. I think it's bad for fb too though as others like Snapchat filling personal gap

joshelman	712105922043088896	2016-03-22T02:37:36	Is there a preference to turn off the exploding heart on Twitter? I am seriously considering no longer  liking tweets

joshelman	711760456361185283	2016-03-21T03:44:51	semil I could have pre written that tweet for you

joshelman	711678006826151940	2016-03-20T22:17:13	bhunstable yeah - many people keep saying that it is a great one. Totally counts!
joshelman	711606979911745536	2016-03-20T17:34:59	merket pt dude - all of this is about engagement. Print and TV are falling off engagement cliff. Twitter is flat and they squeezed $3B
joshelman	711606435365265408	2016-03-20T17:32:49	merket pt ppl think deep demo data matters more than it does. TV and print have none but huge ad business. SC fine if engagement persists.
joshelman	711605432582676480	2016-03-20T17:28:50	merket pt the newly active VCs now aren't even investors lol
joshelman	711605350823124992	2016-03-20T17:28:31	merket pt also this exact post could have been written about fb early and Twitter. Building ad product stack takes time. Deep usage first
joshelman	711602492253995009	2016-03-20T17:17:09	pt jeremysliew all good - I am not new to the product either ;)
joshelman	711601190165807104	2016-03-20T17:11:59	merket pt this isn't true for the largest platforms. Problem is you have to be one of the top 4 for direct buys. G/YT, FB/IG, Y?, Tw? SC?
joshelman	711600103249698816	2016-03-20T17:07:40	aelman works great for me
joshelman	711600018134667265	2016-03-20T17:07:19	merket pt seriously? At massive scale there is always a big direct business. Snapchat will have some programmatic but will be more like TV
joshelman	711599631730278400	2016-03-20T17:05:47	pt perhaps they are thinking "if it works for DJ Khaled, maybe it can work for me?" Where were they when Snapchat raised venture $?

joshelman	709786613199409152	2016-03-15T17:01:30	kubakostecki sure. But even unit costs can be unprofitable if you have a path to be profitable at certain economies of scale
joshelman	709786475953463296	2016-03-15T17:00:57	kubakostecki @SpoonRocket but doesn't matter - as an investor leaking is never your right or job
joshelman	709784307301113856	2016-03-15T16:52:20	kubakostecki @SpoonRocket well hmm. Not sure how that would work broadly. but I always choose transparency over subterfuge
joshelman	709783938873425920	2016-03-15T16:50:52	kubakostecki @SpoonRocket nah. Even then you can be negative until you get to some level of scale.
joshelman	709783679543812096	2016-03-15T16:49:51	Paul__Walsh jeremys sama multiple factors. Sometimes just taking enough time to get to know someone and see how they work to be ready

joshelman	709783229075566592	2016-03-15T16:48:03	kubakostecki @SpoonRocket also, part of building a long term company is the challenge of working through losses first. Sometimes it works
joshelman	709783082664988672	2016-03-15T16:47:28	kubakostecki @SpoonRocket totally different points. I am just sad someone who actually invested in the company leaked their story
joshelman	709782868503867392	2016-03-15T16:46:37	azeem sure - which is why I didn't invest. But plenty of years to plan ahead for their future businesses

joshelman	709768457865170945	2016-03-15T15:49:21	austinhutchison @SpoonRocket hah fine. But as an investor, why is it whistleblowing to share a note that a company is shutting down?
joshelman	709768140817739776	2016-03-15T15:48:06	angusdav JoshConstine MikeIsaac spoonrocket acts like a restaurant. It makes the food itself. Not delivering from others.

joshelman	709564418342785024	2016-03-15T02:18:35	trengriffin are there better barriers for Uber? Seems like the core question is getting this unit cost profitable (possible?) then scaled
joshelman	709563986027483137	2016-03-15T02:16:51	Yes - a space where a few companies have closed. But the story isn't as over as the article seems. Rooting for Luxe.

joshelman	705577144152256512	2016-03-04T02:14:34	This is a great pledge from my friend heathwblack about turning off the phone when getting home from work on Friday 
joshelman	705532840092413954	2016-03-03T23:18:31	It's good that people are trying to understand snapchat but jeez they still don't get it 
joshelman	705532335240802304	2016-03-03T23:16:31	anamitra wfarner GreylockVC so awesome for Bill and John!
joshelman	705508430811770880	2016-03-03T21:41:32	Always fun to when startups get national coverage. Go ParibusCo 
joshelman	705402872926588928	2016-03-03T14:42:05	JoshConstine but none of these big bets implied the company was doomed or needed to pivot or anything. Shots certainly didn't
joshelman	705402754928238593	2016-03-03T14:41:37	JoshConstine I would hardly call it "saved". perhaps propelled it to a new level. Big bets make companies great. Some work some don't.
joshelman	705401101550399489	2016-03-03T14:35:02	JoshConstine yes - but you could have said the same thing about Facebook and photo albums, or snapchat and snaps. Improving isn't pivoting
joshelman	705400250404450305	2016-03-03T14:31:40	meredithperry chrisamccoy perhaps it is a marathon comprised solely of continuous sprints
joshelman	705400129570807808	2016-03-03T14:31:11	JoshConstine "pivot" implies something wasn't working so they switched their model and I guess I wanted to reject that implication
joshelman	705399978458374144	2016-03-03T14:30:35	JoshConstine sure - and semantics are tricky. I just think products with communities need to always evolve and get better.
joshelman	705395693746126848	2016-03-03T14:13:33	JoshConstine or it is just leveraging the graphs it has built to push more content through new pipes. Fb puts new content in all the time
joshelman	705395308503572480	2016-03-03T14:12:01	JoshConstine why is this a big pivot? Feels like a natural extension

joshelman	705138426354356224	2016-03-02T21:11:16	cacheop yeah - just keep everything as low key as you can. Always tricky :)
joshelman	705136924537663488	2016-03-02T21:05:18	cacheop I think as a startup you have to race to the next big strategic thing ahead of incumbents. Even off their backs
joshelman	705136515043569664	2016-03-02T21:03:40	cacheop oh - got it. Well in some ways that is a good goal - if you can independence before they can catch up. Eg Instagram vs fb
joshelman	705134650633486336	2016-03-02T20:56:16	cacheop outpacing them sounds like a good thing?

joshelman	704001454151864320	2016-02-28T17:53:21	Many people pointed out there will be no stop signs since cars will organize efficiently to pass at intersections. Can I pay to go faster?
joshelman	704001252091277312	2016-02-28T17:52:32	felixgurtler my point was more can someone pay to go faster than someone else? Eg you pause so I can get by even faster?
joshelman	703995803262537728	2016-02-28T17:30:53	AdamSinger I don't buy that - people are still people and will procrastinate if they can find a way to catch back up
joshelman	703995609154367488	2016-02-28T17:30:07	gauravdmehta because sometimes some people will be willing to pay more to go first, others willing to save
joshelman	703992122131685376	2016-02-28T17:16:16	AdamSinger sure but what if I am late and want to pay to go faster
joshelman	703992049050087425	2016-02-28T17:15:58	xander76 agreed - might be very easy to handle the transit special lanes and special speeds. Also the motorcade
joshelman	703988100645556224	2016-02-28T17:00:17	AdamSinger yes - especially if I can pay for every other car to get out of my way

joshelman	703806348937400321	2016-02-28T04:58:04	agolis pkafka hunterwalk also nowhere should it explicitly call these "featured" users vs suggestions you may be interested in on a topic
joshelman	703806135841591296	2016-02-28T04:57:13	agolis pkafka hunterwalk and he gets a lot of media coverage too
joshelman	703806079612776448	2016-02-28T04:57:00	agolis pkafka hunterwalk fair enough and I know there is a lot of co-learning (Don graham on board of Facebook for example)

joshelman	703804811888562176	2016-02-28T04:51:57	hunterwalk nothing better than deep policy debates around the meaning of the word "is"
joshelman	703804058671263745	2016-02-28T04:48:58	agolis pkafka hunterwalk absolutely. "Fair and balanced" ftw!
joshelman	703803976420954112	2016-02-28T04:48:38	hunterwalk agolis pkafka content and IP rights / parody - some massive issues when you get into actually making products :-)
joshelman	703803751191093251	2016-02-28T04:47:44	agolis pkafka hunterwalk you would be surprised at the rigor of the debates inside the companies I worked at along these lines
joshelman	703803543166148608	2016-02-28T04:46:55	agolis pkafka hunterwalk oh come on. Software builders believe in positive impact greatly. And build systems that can scale to do so
joshelman	703802910619009024	2016-02-28T04:44:24	pkafka agolis hunterwalk StephenCurry30 I think at a broad level yes. Not sure if every single one though?
joshelman	703802596977283072	2016-02-28T04:43:09	agolis pkafka hunterwalk yes. I think also lightly different perspective if you come from a media background vs not too
joshelman	703802423358283776	2016-02-28T04:42:28	pkafka agolis hunterwalk only with the most clearly laid out rules as possible - similar to algorithm. And very sensitively.

joshelman	703801672095563777	2016-02-28T04:39:29	pkafka agolis hunterwalk Disagree. Algorithms consistently apply rules. If you start being inconsistent based on humans, it changes
joshelman	703801173023674368	2016-02-28T04:37:30	agolis hunterwalk pkafka yes - but you over ascribe outcome as endorsement
joshelman	703801039779016704	2016-02-28T04:36:58	pkafka agolis hunterwalk sure. But it tries to be crystal clear when it does this in terms of code of conduct.

joshelman	703799386824769545	2016-02-28T04:30:24	agolis hunterwalk pkafka at some level sure. Every company tries to produce more things people will use/buy
joshelman	703796691468554240	2016-02-28T04:19:41	agolis hunterwalk pkafka sure - fine to call them ethically responsible. Given the data is based on user behavior - users culpable too!
joshelman	703794611123138560	2016-02-28T04:11:25	agolis hunterwalk pkafka because parts of the system such as suggested users are algorithmic - and independent of judgment on content

joshelman	703789370675896321	2016-02-28T03:50:36	hunterwalk anildash was never intended to be. Was intended to be flag of authenticity - that this is the official account for known figure
joshelman	703788939631398912	2016-02-28T03:48:53	omid hunterwalk anildash that is a good question. I bet a refresh of the data for closest category would now suggest politics
joshelman	703788527952068608	2016-02-28T03:47:15	anildash hunterwalk I don't think it is Twitter's place to editorialize
joshelman	703788413892186112	2016-02-28T03:46:48	louisgray hunterwalk anildash sure - but the point is to onboard new users most effectively. Not to suggest favorites (since early 2010)
joshelman	703788188943257600	2016-02-28T03:45:54	hunterwalk anildash I think it is very hard to be editorial on something like this.
joshelman	703788087218991104	2016-02-28T03:45:30	jan_sramek hunterwalk pkafka depends on whose side you are on. Hence algorithms!
joshelman	703787824798011392	2016-02-28T03:44:27	hunterwalk anildash and the biggest challenge is this is basically same onboarding for 5 years. Should be radically different by now
joshelman	703787689590394880	2016-02-28T03:43:55	hunterwalk anildash well I think they are not refreshing it as it once happened. The data doesn't change that radically

joshelman	703787390683353088	2016-02-28T03:42:44	anildash hunterwalk pkafka sure re verified. Early SUL was not a factor when we made the switch over
joshelman	703786600342237184	2016-02-28T03:39:35	hunterwalk pkafka algorithms - who do people follow in early sessions that create sticking behavior. Not editorial

joshelman	700889299449835520	2016-02-20T03:46:45	ilyamuz ok. I am fine with good critical analysis. But sometimes the critique misses a lot of the behind the scenes reality
joshelman	700888508731273216	2016-02-20T03:43:37	ilyamuz and on a case by case basis I would say some people had different assessments of risk than I might have
joshelman	700888322403471360	2016-02-20T03:42:52	ilyamuz but if someone has an unlucky portfolio without any of the ultimately big winners, they may lose real $. That is the risk
joshelman	700888153826000896	2016-02-20T03:42:12	ilyamuz well - there will be some huge winners and many disappointments. In aggregate I bet it is very positive
joshelman	700887866532966400	2016-02-20T03:41:03	ilyamuz yes - if they are not investing with a portfolio approach. Nor properly assuming risk.
joshelman	700887511250284545	2016-02-20T03:39:39	ilyamuz I am not actually sure if/what we are arguing about. I agree on unearthing fraud and malice.
joshelman	700887270195228673	2016-02-20T03:38:41	ilyamuz and so it is the pursuit that is important. Valuations generally take both risk and opportunity into account.
joshelman	700887106063716352	2016-02-20T03:38:02	ilyamuz well the entire startup ecosystem is built with expectation that some will win massively but many unfortunately won't

joshelman	699758600470724608	2016-02-17T00:53:45	AlexCartaz yeah - though not sure it really overlaps with math. I think keeping them separate will help make CS a new pillar
joshelman	699758454219485184	2016-02-17T00:53:11	thesixcents25 teaching office is a good skill too though. But different!
joshelman	699758248010776576	2016-02-17T00:52:21	abrams though maybe we should count the last time I interacted with gravity, food, or chemicals
joshelman	699757993609424896	2016-02-17T00:51:21	christiancnguy perhaps. But understanding those basics is a very good foundation for understanding world around us
joshelman	699757819562602497	2016-02-17T00:50:39	mckaythomas who? ;)
joshelman	699757763417677824	2016-02-17T00:50:26	thesixcents25 understanding math doesn't prepare you for functional programming. Both valuable but different
joshelman	699757633364848640	2016-02-17T00:49:55	Also just as relevant would be to teach computing skills. Like how to google and determine which sites are legitimate. SMS and Email too
joshelman	699757417765040128	2016-02-17T00:49:03	But the basic skills to understand what is going on behind the scenes in a computer seem as important to teach as the other science basics
joshelman	699757083483213824	2016-02-17T00:47:44	It doesn't mean everyone needs to be a coder - just like everyone doesn't need to become a biologist chemist or physicist.
joshelman	699756906550730752	2016-02-17T00:47:02	It seems to me that computer science in school should be as core as biology chemistry and physics.

joshelman	699275741473538048	2016-02-15T16:55:03	sarahcuda sarahnadav yes - there are all kinds of biases in VC. Some people call these "instincts". It is a real challenge of the job

joshelman	698661633778790400	2016-02-14T00:14:48	HumbleRando well there you go. My point is both sides jumped to strategy
joshelman	698659907222970368	2016-02-14T00:07:57	HumbleRando and I retweeted Cruz too. And yes McConnell's behavior here was abhorrent

joshelman	698606101055434753	2016-02-13T20:34:08	VarunJuice I don't think that means old ppl though
joshelman	698605963440365568	2016-02-13T20:33:35	lenberg anchor I honestly struggle with audio. I don't really listen or pay attention well. But the anchor experience excited me to try
joshelman	698605377957433344	2016-02-13T20:31:16	VarunJuice anchor huh. Ok
joshelman	698605291223388160	2016-02-13T20:30:55	lenberg perhaps right in long term. But the onboarding is great
joshelman	698603935775350784	2016-02-13T20:25:32	stevesi imcatnoone tzhongg what is your favorite product that does it that way?

joshelman	698602935123488768	2016-02-13T20:21:33	imcatnoone tzhongg stevesi yeah they should give an option to "say skip"
joshelman	698600896481988608	2016-02-13T20:13:27	maxbulger adding contacts is all i really meant per graph
joshelman	698599768407220224	2016-02-13T20:08:58	stevesi tzhongg I said "more good steps" üòâ.  We had to throw plenty out that didn't perform.
joshelman	698599484658311168	2016-02-13T20:07:51	stevesi tzhongg I have worked with many products on this. Both as a job and advising. More good steps always led to better engagement
joshelman	698599111314964480	2016-02-13T20:06:22	Hadley garyvee anchor I said great onboarding. it is. Still some work to see if I stick with listening to more audio. Like it so far
joshelman	698598909547933696	2016-02-13T20:05:34	tzhongg stevesi fair to question if someone recording needs to be there. In early days they want engaged community so could be a filter
joshelman	698598667343654914	2016-02-13T20:04:36	stevesi tzhongg we are biased in the tech world and think we know what we are doing. From my exp, longer but clean onboarding is better
joshelman	698598246201987072	2016-02-13T20:02:55	maxbulger doesn't defer it - phone contacts come pretty quickly. And your friends get notified when you show up

joshelman	698567287079464961	2016-02-13T17:59:54	kydoh anchor longer flows often perform better if every step depends someone's experience. People that bail would just bail anyway
joshelman	698561297537871878	2016-02-13T17:36:06	CtotheJones anchor sure - but maybe times you want to listen instead of read? Makes it much more personal
joshelman	698560124638490624	2016-02-13T17:31:26	People still ask if Ev and Biz work hard / daily at medium and jelly. I haven't seen many founders work harder. 
joshelman	698559229624348672	2016-02-13T17:27:53	ruchitgarg anchor sure - but especially in early days better to set expectations that you can participate.
joshelman	698559011793178624	2016-02-13T17:27:01	StefanoZorzi it is really well done. I think the issue has more to do with listening over reading than things they can just iterate on
joshelman	698558571991027712	2016-02-13T17:25:16	ruchitgarg anchor I think setting up your profile is a normal thing. I was intrigued to do it this way and be walked through
joshelman	698558419540668416	2016-02-13T17:24:40	StefanoZorzi I agree. I struggle on most listening formats for foreground audio. I struggle to pay attention
joshelman	698557784594337793	2016-02-13T17:22:09	ruchitgarg anchor ah - well I guess you weren't that interested anyway!
joshelman	698556966176600064	2016-02-13T17:18:53	StefanoZorzi fair enough. You have to want to listen to others
joshelman	698556918449643520	2016-02-13T17:18:42	ruchitgarg anchor different issue than onboarding
joshelman	698555461075759104	2016-02-13T17:12:55	The onboarding on Anchor is one of the best I have experienced in a long time

joshelman	698360120590229504	2016-02-13T04:16:42	heathwblack semil Besvinick the marketing is still "we can help you scale"

joshelman	698357948146257921	2016-02-13T04:08:04	heathwblack Besvinick semil is this a bad thing? We might see more masses of people working together creating even greater things
joshelman	698357616297115651	2016-02-13T04:06:45	fmanjoo yeah but why fight a day of love when you can just celebrate. I hope you don't rampage birthdays next.
joshelman	698357353926647808	2016-02-13T04:05:42	heathwblack Besvinick semil oh come on. That's bs and you know it. There are plenty of ways to explore ideas and get something working

joshelman	698356252556943360	2016-02-13T04:01:20	heathwblack Besvinick semil correct. But we will see fewer well funded companies around the latter
joshelman	698356021547282432	2016-02-13T04:00:25	If you want to be inspired about the future of LinkedIn, watch the video in here. And ignore the stock movement

joshelman	697868721008697344	2016-02-11T19:44:03	toscasac until you see the product, this argument is moot. They don't filter things out. They just bump a few more to the top.

joshelman	697449834714779648	2016-02-10T15:59:33	Carnage4Life the biggest cause of churn is people not finding things relevant to them. Relevance is just one tiny piece (if user is set up)
joshelman	697449672575623169	2016-02-10T15:58:54	grmeyer yup
joshelman	697447902818373633	2016-02-10T15:51:52	The tweaks to the timeline to show what is most relevant is just the first step. Helping people find what their interests comes next I hope.
joshelman	697447713026093056	2016-02-10T15:51:07	But what there can and I hope will be is a sum of lots of improvements that collectively make things much better. Compounding improvement.

joshelman	697447125299298304	2016-02-10T15:48:47	The best part of Twitter launching algorithms is that they are launching meaningful tweaks to the core Twitter product and experience

joshelman	696841205775101952	2016-02-08T23:41:04	quantity stevesi because most people learned from their friends :).  I find it incredibly powerful and useful.

joshelman	696840661325058048	2016-02-08T23:38:54	stevesi jjmaxwell4 so I think the best flows have a conscious choice per step, not just next next next. It creates much better recall.
joshelman	696840250048393216	2016-02-08T23:37:16	stevesi lauraglu jjmaxwell4 absolutely. Knowing you can fix a mistake is the best possible to help someone explore
joshelman	696840021450469376	2016-02-08T23:36:22	jjmaxwell4 stevesi sure. But the onboarding takes you through more than just adding friends. Eg subtle things they do for early news feed
joshelman	696839752620908545	2016-02-08T23:35:18	stevesi jjmaxwell4 I've found the best way to learn snapchat is have a friend show you
joshelman	696838928930766848	2016-02-08T23:32:01	stevesi jjmaxwell4 really? You must be trying easier products than me :)  Or just smarter. Probably that!
joshelman	696838835976536064	2016-02-08T23:31:39	jjmaxwell4 stevesi nope. FB's initial onboarding steps are critical to get a user going/set up. Contacts, hs/college/etc. then pmyk starts
joshelman	696836165257732096	2016-02-08T23:21:03	jjmaxwell4 stevesi most products are very complicated. expecting that is like playing the lottery. Some users get it, but many don't
joshelman	696835656354390016	2016-02-08T23:19:01	stevesi interesting. i've always thought onboarding should be a core focus of a team who is iterating. not slapped on (which builds debt)
joshelman	696832003832852480	2016-02-08T23:04:30	stevesi ironic probably wrong phrase. just counter-intuitive. I find people who show up to a product curious to learn. Games do this well.
joshelman	696830714289872896	2016-02-08T22:59:23	stevesi naynerz this is very important - treat users who show up are curious and interested rather than "dumb and need training"
joshelman	696830241591861248	2016-02-08T22:57:30	stevesi but again really for on boarding and getting someone set up rather than ongoing
joshelman	696830167700754432	2016-02-08T22:57:13	stevesi ironically we found that adding steps in the flow led to more engaged users a week later (as long as they were useful steps)
joshelman	696827316148699137	2016-02-08T22:45:53	stevesi "just press Start"
joshelman	696826968356945920	2016-02-08T22:44:30	stevesi and yeah a product that doesn't evolve as the user gets better is problematic and becomes baggage
joshelman	696826784755486720	2016-02-08T22:43:46	stevesi I also find learn by doing and making conscious choices step by step much better than explainer screens
joshelman	696826651372466177	2016-02-08T22:43:14	stevesi yeah - it really is about getting someone to a point of self sustaining. not always showing them "easier screens"
joshelman	696825192769654785	2016-02-08T22:37:26	stevesi one critique of office as it became more powerful is the training wheels were harder to find (rather than get rid of)
joshelman	696824916079833088	2016-02-08T22:36:21	stevesi think training wheels vs long term utility
joshelman	696824834399993856	2016-02-08T22:36:01	stevesi right - this is really intended for onboarding. Eg get users up to a place they are self sustaining. Then let them explore
joshelman	696752421012246528	2016-02-08T17:48:16	scottbelsky thrilled for you. Way to make a strong team even stronger

joshelman	696217800046567425	2016-02-07T06:23:53	mrbitterness makes sense. Am sure content will shift with any new changes. I see it with photo and video tweets too.

joshelman	693637006086123520	2016-01-31T03:28:44	thomascornelius semil rabois precisely the challenge!  We don't fund based on milestones achieved. Just alignment on big prize potential
joshelman	693635316087848960	2016-01-31T03:22:01	thomascornelius semil rabois any evidence it is going somewhere big (like a small group of addicted customers/users)
joshelman	693621243967356928	2016-01-31T02:26:06	So proud of milenaberry !!!! A company that can truly change the way the world works, go powertofly !   
joshelman	693621679004618760	2016-01-31T02:27:49	semil rfradin if you just go meet people the first time and lay out high expectations, then it's very hard. VERY
joshelman	693621566207188992	2016-01-31T02:27:22	semil rfradin i think if you develop long term relationships with people who would want to get involved at some price, you can go back
joshelman	693621359360897024	2016-01-31T02:26:33	john_cogs teamreboot hblodget mathewi the issue with Twitter is not monetizing their surface area. That is going well. Need more surface
joshelman	693621133816389632	2016-01-31T02:25:39	semil rfradin very hard to reset from initial expectations without a much longer relationship
joshelman	693620248239435777	2016-01-31T02:22:08	teamreboot hblodget mathewi yes - especially when they had the talent and plan to win.
joshelman	693618967420645376	2016-01-31T02:17:03	hblodget teamreboot mathewi most of the greatest services started as niche and expanded from there. Twitter has just gotten stuck
joshelman	693618806707527680	2016-01-31T02:16:24	hblodget teamreboot mathewi not achieving the massive potential (yet) is more about execution than it being niche
joshelman	693618705750601728	2016-01-31T02:16:00	hblodget teamreboot mathewi Facebook is about connecting with friends. Twitter could/should have been about your interests

joshelman	693568154962792448	2016-01-30T22:55:08	mulligan kennethn right - but a "follow" isn't same as sharing email so talking about how to offer that
joshelman	693567273726947329	2016-01-30T22:51:38	mulligan kennethn yeah - they are discussing how to make sure this doesn't create lock-in. And people can still share email addresses
joshelman	693566889063116800	2016-01-30T22:50:06	mulligan kennethn sure. But for someone like Ken, people will jump through hoops to get the content. It's nice for content to be hosted

joshelman	684589368929943553	2016-01-06T04:16:39	dougw kind of a good contextual slip up
joshelman	684579956265893888	2016-01-06T03:39:15	iano oh sure. The marketing claims through onboarding all too much.

joshelman	684576480517615618	2016-01-06T03:25:26	joshelman wonder if this sets some form of precedent for disclosing incentivized reviews in customer testimonials 
joshelman	684574824144834560	2016-01-06T03:18:51	Huh - I have often referred to Lumosity as having great onboarding for its games/products. Maybe too good...

joshelman	684557428470333440	2016-01-06T02:09:44	abiekatz listening matters more than shouting on Twitter. Need a few you really know and care about vs volume.
joshelman	684508268920623104	2016-01-05T22:54:23	heif fredwilson joshm sure. Though subject lines in email still matter a lot too :)
joshelman	684465200704036864	2016-01-05T20:03:15	MarkUry nah - we all watch certain shows, listen to certain music, go to certain movies. Twitter just not easy enough.
joshelman	684455934404366337	2016-01-05T19:26:25	toddsampson yes - will be nice. Except I don't think it will transform Twitter

joshelman	684428533783920640	2016-01-05T17:37:33	iano oh it is fine. They should do it and keep making core better. But everyone writing that this will save Twitter - calling BS
joshelman	684428176722808832	2016-01-05T17:36:08	@bala__menon same goes for every platform. You have to cultivate audience not just expect it
joshelman	684428126131077120	2016-01-05T17:35:55	@bala__menon not about fixing graph as much as helping everyone build a great one. If so, would be plenty more engagement
joshelman	684426920197423104	2016-01-05T17:31:08	iano it is a fine change. Just not the transformative one that needs to happen

joshelman	684425471514128384	2016-01-05T17:25:23	mathewi yeah I meant "useful lists" ;)
joshelman	684425092705562624	2016-01-05T17:23:52	It is the graph that matters most for Twitter over time much more than the content that flows through it - 140 or 14000 characters. Graph.
joshelman	684424904083550208	2016-01-05T17:23:07	But damn it is hard. It is hard to express at individual accounts level . Twitter needs topics. It needs live streams. It needs lists.
joshelman	684424618036166656	2016-01-05T17:21:59	Get it right, Twitter is magic. MAGIC. Every time I open Twitter I access great information from the world on all the things I love
joshelman	684424435017711617	2016-01-05T17:21:15	On Twitter, the quality of your timeline is on you. You have to figure out who to follow. It is still hard and opaque.
joshelman	684424311143153664	2016-01-05T17:20:46	On Facebook this is easy - you just say if you know someone or not. You get good enough content. If you don't like it, blame your friends.
joshelman	684424088136224768	2016-01-05T17:19:53	The problem is the graph. It is really really hard to set one up. To find people and accounts on topics you care about. the right cadence.
joshelman	684423845848059905	2016-01-05T17:18:55	It seems a lot of people think the problem with Twitter is the content - more photos, more characters, more video. That is not it.
joshelman	684422902679257090	2016-01-05T17:15:10	Platform lock-in is a myth that will fuck so many companies ‚Äî humans actually seek variety and are absurdly fickle about how they see / read

joshelman	683813962232639488	2016-01-04T00:55:27	sarthakgh hnshah neilpatel gotcha. I thought that was "amazing" as in unexpected surprise
joshelman	683812849701928960	2016-01-04T00:51:02	mikeytom yup. And also the Rams are their kryptonite
joshelman	683810145596395520	2016-01-04T00:40:17	When everyone was doubting the Seahawks, I predicted 10-6, playoffs and now they have a shot. On our way! GoHawks 
joshelman	683809544238071808	2016-01-04T00:37:54	sarthakgh hnshah neilpatel why amazing? Good people get supported
joshelman	683789759135612928	2016-01-03T23:19:17	kubakostecki hnshah neilpatel OR, those that can explain their products will rise up to attract customers and those that deliver will win
joshelman	683789415290830849	2016-01-03T23:17:55	adamac step 2 is once the things are connected, make them really do interesting things. Right now it is manual/scripted. Future won't be
joshelman	683789173984133121	2016-01-03T23:16:57	adamac sure - and most of what Zuck talks about isn't strong AI either. Step one is make things connected and controllable...
joshelman	683788880458289152	2016-01-03T23:15:47	Tuviae hahaha sure. SmartThings was still on phase 1 - connect the things - before it sold. It is always a process
joshelman	683787271376519168	2016-01-03T23:09:24	Excited for hnshah and neilpatel to build the defining tools that use content to drive customers 
joshelman	683786800146432000	2016-01-03T23:07:31	adamac besides the face recognition, you can do most of this already with SmartThings + Echo + alerts when camera activity triggers
joshelman	683785179639328768	2016-01-03T23:01:05	Sounds like the same vision as smartthings. Hopefully that will help!

joshelman	683767225145143296	2016-01-03T21:49:44	bubbam CapitalOne didn't work then. They shoulda made it harder ;)
joshelman	683763139935010817	2016-01-03T21:33:30	bubbam CapitalOne so did you keep it since they were so nice?
joshelman	683721583848890368	2016-01-03T18:48:23	sarahtavel Mazzeo pressure for a cool enough story is going up and up among the core audience. Still gets watched perhaps
joshelman	683721321134440448	2016-01-03T18:47:20	hunterwalk or do you have one but can't actually figure out how to print from any of your computers?
joshelman	683718581549273088	2016-01-03T18:36:27	aunder iano no, sitting on the beach (nice geotag!) and tweeting support and feature requests is pretty much it
joshelman	683718238954377217	2016-01-03T18:35:05	aunder iano she does Twitter tech support too!  ;).  Still your news makes me so excited for slack and you
joshelman	683715894476836864	2016-01-03T18:25:46	sacca sarahtavel I always thought Live would be for the in between times for people who make video/content (like Twitter was re blogging)
joshelman	683709621660299264	2016-01-03T18:00:51	lg is this your annual humblebragwhine about having a short Twitter handle? By the way any CES booth specials?
joshelman	683708578637611008	2016-01-03T17:56:42	sarahtavel scottbelsky eye theft? What a gory way to start the new year!

joshelman	683667538878709760	2016-01-03T15:13:37	Nice overview of how medium's new network is starting to break through in Washington DC politics 
joshelman	683667057238360064	2016-01-03T15:11:43	Today feels like the official last day of 2015. Happy new year everyone!

joshelman	683429439783354368	2016-01-02T23:27:30	adamokane they already have a "live" product for events happening. Am sure they'll find a way to integrate realtime video when makes sense

joshelman	683154691463622656	2016-01-02T05:15:45	Everyone should be doing research like this as they build apps 
joshelman	683098222407979008	2016-01-02T01:31:22	johnmccrea ustwogames how long do you spend in there? I always get a headache if &gt; 10 min

joshelman	683089580640178177	2016-01-02T00:57:01	danemcleod BrianNorgard fair enough. Especially hope they can lose the one awkward loss per year
joshelman	683082918030278656	2016-01-02T00:30:33	danemcleod BrianNorgard has maintained and grown a great program and recruits well. They always lose one game stupidly
joshelman	683081686335107072	2016-01-02T00:25:39	BrianNorgard yeah it has been a great decade.

joshelman	683080574441893888	2016-01-02T00:21:14	BrianNorgard the team is excellent. If they had just beaten northwestern they might have won this whole thing
