dinapomeranz	720641186193674241	2016-04-14T15:53:42	WSpriggs That's where I think we differ. Sometimes, protecting US workers comes at the expense of foreign workers we keep out.

dinapomeranz	716274700226322433	2016-04-02T14:42:50	kpomerleau Number of brackets can be associated with high or low redistribution, what matters is rates. That's it from my end, gotta go :)
dinapomeranz	716274361125175296	2016-04-02T14:41:30	kpomerleau So all else equal, if more flows, it tends to be more redistributive. But it depends a lot about what the rate is on each level.
dinapomeranz	716274191545331712	2016-04-02T14:40:49	kpomerleau Sorry, 140 characters is too short for me to explain calculation of redistribution. It's how much flows from richer to poorer.

dinapomeranz	716261831921246208	2016-04-02T13:51:42	kpomerleau That is completely unclear. It depends on what the tax rates are at the different parts of the income distribution.
