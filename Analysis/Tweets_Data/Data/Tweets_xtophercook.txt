xtophercook	721434944803889157	2016-04-16T20:27:49	The whole point of conditionality/means testing - what UBI sweeps away - is that it allows state to be much more generous to people in need.

xtophercook	704613267356983296	2016-03-01T10:24:28	julesmattsson Yup - agreed. I'd assumed they'd cut the UTT, which always seemed the more pointless to me.
xtophercook	704613172674744321	2016-03-01T10:24:06	Proposals would prevent appeal against the ICO on, say, judgment of public interest (like here:  )
xtophercook	704612502617911296	2016-03-01T10:21:26	.julesmattsson re-reading it more closely, abolishing the FTT looks problematic. It would make the appeals process against the ICO weaker.

xtophercook	697845422602219520	2016-02-11T18:11:28	rappingroni in short: I think his "clarification" is he doesn't want his support for contract to be seen as support for imposition...
xtophercook	697844514577321984	2016-02-11T18:07:52	rappingroni ShaunLintern As a professional press release parses, I think the statement is carefully worded, and he hasn't contradicted it.
xtophercook	697843996568199168	2016-02-11T18:05:48	rappingroni ShaunLintern I read it as "I am willing to support x, but that should not be taken as a view on y"

xtophercook	697842940870291457	2016-02-11T18:01:37	rappingroni ShaunLintern Yes. And that's different to "I supported the contract offer, but I oppose imposition". He also said...
xtophercook	697841424507760640	2016-02-11T17:55:35	rappingroni ShaunLintern Check on Miles... I read that as "I didn't mean to endorse that". Which is different to "I oppose imposition".
xtophercook	697841107200307201	2016-02-11T17:54:19	ShaunLintern Is "not publicly supporting imposition" the same as "opposing imposition"?
xtophercook	697840784800903168	2016-02-11T17:53:03	ShaunLintern It's not insignificant that they're sliding away, but some are using slippery language (and caveats like "that's for the SoS")
xtophercook	697839558994632705	2016-02-11T17:48:10	ShaunLintern No - saying they didn't intend a statement to indicate support for imposition doesn't mean they oppose imposition.
xtophercook	697838709224402944	2016-02-11T17:44:48	ShaunLintern "against" is a bit strong. A bit of weaselly nuance in this.

xtophercook	694059869062709248	2016-02-01T07:29:02	PACAC's words on that are extremely powerful. 
xtophercook	694059671548751872	2016-02-01T07:28:15	Throughout this whole process, people have asked about the good work done by the charity, something xtophercook and I don't dispute.

xtophercook	683028523477512193	2016-01-01T20:54:24	RiazMMM This comes to another thing: when does it come up? For news reporters? Not exactly big on Guardian news pages, for example.
xtophercook	683027258529943552	2016-01-01T20:49:23	RiazMMM So you'd have to use it with a prefix saying "I'm using it in the correct way, which is xxxxxx". And we'd have to do that for a bit
xtophercook	683027067882074116	2016-01-01T20:48:37	RiazMMM No - not quite. It's that the word isn't understood widely. And if it is, it is a shibboleth meaning "nasty Tories".

xtophercook	683025601381429249	2016-01-01T20:42:48	RiazMMM kindofwater My point is that it would - right now - need a preamble and explanation. You couldn't use it nakedly.
xtophercook	683025442295660544	2016-01-01T20:42:10	RiazMMM kindofwater I'm a reporter - only in charge of myself.

xtophercook	683023051156537345	2016-01-01T20:32:40	kindofwater At the moment, yes. But that could change if Corbyn does make a critique of neolib a big thing and it gets currency.
xtophercook	683022688374358021	2016-01-01T20:31:13	kindofwater I won't block you if you accept I'm acting in good faith. And if there are words you think I should avoid, let me know too
xtophercook	683022047220510724	2016-01-01T20:28:40	kindofwater No - I'm not. But I think your tweet reads as if I'm saying NEVER USE THIS WORD. Which I hope I've been clear I'm not.

xtophercook	683021480096038913	2016-01-01T20:26:25	kindofwater That's not what I said. I said it should only be used with an explanation of what it is. (Please retweet this too)

xtophercook	683015235733745664	2016-01-01T20:01:36	kindofwater I'm not seeking to be dismissive, at all. I take your point fully. But I hope you can also see why (a) it needs explanation...
xtophercook	683014863271149569	2016-01-01T20:00:07	kindofwater (I was quite surprised by this, btw:  )
xtophercook	683014750033285122	2016-01-01T19:59:40	kindofwater But that's sort of the point.  If JMcD gave a big speech on the neoliberal economy, we'd use it and explain it, of course.
xtophercook	683014383421800448	2016-01-01T19:58:13	kindofwater ..on neoliberalism. He had a few things he wanted to get out - not that.
xtophercook	683014170862841862	2016-01-01T19:57:22	kindofwater To be clear, when politicians give speeches, they usually have a news story or narrative in mind. JMcD did *not* want seminar..
xtophercook	683014035382648832	2016-01-01T19:56:50	kindofwater He literally just says "This is a radical departure not just from neoliberalism"... That's it.
xtophercook	683013615335682048	2016-01-01T19:55:10	kindofwater He actually only uses the word once, doesn't he? And not in a part he wanted us to cover.
xtophercook	683013003307016193	2016-01-01T19:52:44	kindofwater We are in charge of clarity. Where we think their message is unclear, we'd either explain or find synonyms.
xtophercook	683010634657742854	2016-01-01T19:43:19	kindofwater And if they're unfamiliar or contested, you explain them. ("Is Cameron a proper Conservative?" was a theme of 2005-6 and 2010)
xtophercook	683010393841729536	2016-01-01T19:42:22	kindofwater It's really not terribly problematic. For the most part, you use labels people give themselves at the time.
xtophercook	683009531236986880	2016-01-01T19:38:56	kindofwater davies_will It helps with those, though, that they're words people apply to themselves - and that's not contested.

xtophercook	682933621964029952	2016-01-01T14:37:18	mrjamesmack johnmcternan In all seriousness, I place hundreds of bets a year (all tiny) as a way of working out if my assumptions work
xtophercook	682931134863400960	2016-01-01T14:27:25	mrjamesmack johnmcternan frivolously, here's a funny article on buying a barrel of oil: 
xtophercook	682931036918026240	2016-01-01T14:27:02	mrjamesmack johnmcternan Seriously: I do find betting small sums is actually a good discipline for working through your priors.
xtophercook	682926331382874112	2016-01-01T14:08:20	Astroclassicist twlldun It was always a bit fudgy (Goldhagen et al aside). But sensible structuralism seems norm now.
xtophercook	682925319037272064	2016-01-01T14:04:18	Astroclassicist twlldun ...but the structuralists were way ahead when I was last engaged with it all.
xtophercook	682925201621958656	2016-01-01T14:03:50	Astroclassicist twlldun I've lost track of where the structualists v intentionalists arguments now are on Nazi Germany...
xtophercook	682897764787830784	2016-01-01T12:14:49	montie RupertMyers Because each party NEEDS a supply of peers. They need bodies on seats - and need those people to turn up.
xtophercook	682897375254417408	2016-01-01T12:13:16	montie RupertMyers To be clear: I am saying they aren't comparable. And that you should compare Ks to Ks, and peers to peers.

xtophercook	682580837502693376	2015-12-31T15:15:28	TomBaldwin66 SpenceLivermore Dannythefink I agree entirely on first part. Parties not swimming in smart people to take roles as peers.
xtophercook	682579662325846020	2015-12-31T15:10:47	Dannythefink (My quibble has been that I think Livermore a false analogy.)
xtophercook	682579340899545088	2015-12-31T15:09:31	Dannythefink I think donors are doing good, too! That wasn't intended as a slight. People helping parties be competitive are doing good.
xtophercook	682578858378420224	2015-12-31T15:07:36	Dannythefink Yeah, roughly. Or Labour donors etc.
xtophercook	682578004602679298	2015-12-31T15:04:12	investor_bod Giving out a peerage as just a gong would be worse. But that's not really what's happening. Parties struggle to get good peers
xtophercook	682577771852369921	2015-12-31T15:03:17	investor_bod ...really the same as handing out a CONGRATS gong to Lynton. it's closer to the OBEs/MBEs often given to political staff.
xtophercook	682577605921501184	2015-12-31T15:02:37	investor_bod But Labour *must* supply a string of peers. It needs them to fill seats. So asking a long-term employee to take gig not...
