seanhannity	715761956850954241	2016-04-01T04:45:23	I will ask him. And Cruz and kasich  
seanhannity	715761729016299520	2016-04-01T04:44:29	For the last 10 days I have offered SenTedCruz another full hour on my show. I was told they could not make it work 
seanhannity	715760697238495233	2016-04-01T04:40:23	I don't care what u do to be honest.  
seanhannity	715760157582602241	2016-04-01T04:38:14	I would expect SenTedCruz wins Wisconsin. Trump NY

seanhannity	715757477497868288	2016-04-01T04:27:35	I disagree  
seanhannity	715757363211472897	2016-04-01T04:27:08	Thx. Joe!  No worries. Courageous keyboard warriors cannot intimidate me  
seanhannity	715756986432925697	2016-04-01T04:25:38	My point Buckley while a genius had a combative side that I also liked  
seanhannity	715756674880036866	2016-04-01T04:24:24	Awesome story  
seanhannity	715756574627782657	2016-04-01T04:24:00	Hey asshole, SenSasse was 100% wrong in what he accused me of. And I supported him for that seat.  
seanhannity	715756106761576449	2016-04-01T04:22:08	AJ is a. Rockstar 
seanhannity	715755977098833920	2016-04-01T04:21:37	I let the candidates talk. Watch when SenTedCruz is on. He takes a ton of shots realDonaldTrump 
seanhannity	715755713721737216	2016-04-01T04:20:34	It happens every 4 years.  
seanhannity	715755605156306948	2016-04-01T04:20:09	If we were that relevant Obama would never have been elected.  
seanhannity	715755115601379329	2016-04-01T04:18:12	Lighten up. It was Jimmy Kimmel 
seanhannity	715754795274006528	2016-04-01T04:16:55	NeverHillary 
seanhannity	715754570480283649	2016-04-01T04:16:02	Maybe so,But if the party doesn't unite and the circular firing squad continues, then republicans lose &amp; so does USA 
seanhannity	715753916311474176	2016-04-01T04:13:26	Simple answer. Vote and campaign hard for SenTedCruz   I encourage u to fill your heart  
seanhannity	715753640871534592	2016-04-01T04:12:20	A threat asshole?   
seanhannity	715753520658513920	2016-04-01T04:11:52	A reference to Reagan. If u agree with somebody 80% of the time...If R's don't unite, Hillary or Bernie win. Decide 
seanhannity	715752977110343680	2016-04-01T04:09:42	Let me guess Hillary supporter? Or Bernie?   
seanhannity	715739324789231618	2016-04-01T03:15:27	Not president?!  WUT. 
seanhannity	715752414243119105	2016-04-01T04:07:28	I was saying Buckley was a genius. In a class of his own. But he could also be a bit rough around the edges as well 
seanhannity	715751976810717185	2016-04-01T04:05:43	I m not PC or sensitive   SenTedCruz was joking and it was funny 
seanhannity	715751785051369473	2016-04-01T04:04:58	Haha that's funny 
seanhannity	715751695343624193	2016-04-01T04:04:36	I will try. I promise.  
seanhannity	715751468360409089	2016-04-01T04:03:42	Thank u. My only goal in this election is to elect people who will solve our many problems. That's all 
seanhannity	715751071621242880	2016-04-01T04:02:08	Just calling out "purist" sanctimonious hypocrisy. Same people bitching about tone love Buckley Watch the tape  
seanhannity	715749998743433216	2016-04-01T03:57:52	No argument. Buckley was a brilliant scholar. But my point is many who praise him seem to forget his combative side  
seanhannity	715746027224039424	2016-04-01T03:42:05	Also Charles NR is so outraged about realDonaldTrump and his behavior and tone. Have u watched Buckley vs Vidal?   
seanhannity	715745478441377792	2016-04-01T03:39:54	Really Charles C. W.? No pretending on my part. Did NR go to bat for SenTedCruz during his filibuster? I did!

seanhannity	715342629811187714	2016-03-31T00:59:08	Go ahead with a circular firing squad. If people do not unite around the winner, either Trump or Cruz, u will lose

seanhannity	715193714495332352	2016-03-30T15:07:23	Honestly as unlikely as that seems today, maybe teaming up could unite realDonaldTrump and SenTedCruz supporters  
seanhannity	715192663964823552	2016-03-30T15:03:13	So u are a jackass all the time. Good to know.  
seanhannity	715192290046844928	2016-03-30T15:01:44	People are acting like this is new to politics. Primary fights are almost always ugly and brutal. 
seanhannity	715191583264665600	2016-03-30T14:58:55	BuzzFeedAndrew lol. Ok that's funny. I watched 100 times, I see NOTHING that resembles assault. NOTHING.  
seanhannity	715190871248003072	2016-03-30T14:56:05	I refuse to take part in the circular firing squad that is forming. I will support the winner of the primary.  
seanhannity	715190540162220032	2016-03-30T14:54:47	I m not in the Republican Party, although I will vote republican vs Hillary. U can have your party tonight!! Cheers! 
seanhannity	715190247617855489	2016-03-30T14:53:37	I assume u r talking about realDonaldTrump  read his website. Both he and SenTedCruz support health savings accts 
seanhannity	715189397331816448	2016-03-30T14:50:14	Compare promises on immigration HC, energy education the economy trade national security. No differences? Really?  
seanhannity	715188819851616256	2016-03-30T14:47:56	I understand exactly where you are coming from. If SenTedCruz loses the primary you will stay home. I won't do that 
seanhannity	715188136784052224	2016-03-30T14:45:14	If Trump wins I will support him. If Cruz wins I will support him. If u don't vote, that's up to you.  
seanhannity	715187721887748098	2016-03-30T14:43:35	Primary is still ongoing. No such thing as a perfect candidate. Fight hard for who u want is my advice.  
seanhannity	715187471680729088	2016-03-30T14:42:35	Josh r always a jackass or just today?

seanhannity	708442059720540160	2016-03-11T23:58:43	Thank u!!!  I m trying hard 
seanhannity	708441966397267968	2016-03-11T23:58:21	Nope. I m not blocking. People r free to say anything they want.  
seanhannity	708441661676916736	2016-03-11T23:57:09	No 
seanhannity	708441600758845440	2016-03-11T23:56:54	I have asked him every question I can think of. What r u talking about 
seanhannity	708441225376960512	2016-03-11T23:55:24	That's fine. U think for yourself  
seanhannity	708441140761071616	2016-03-11T23:55:04	I hope so  
seanhannity	708440787726368769	2016-03-11T23:53:40	We both want our country saved. Let's start there  
seanhannity	708440645275406336	2016-03-11T23:53:06	Thank u. Happy weekend!! 
seanhannity	708440506410405888	2016-03-11T23:52:33	Nope. Let people vent and speak their minds. I know allowing equal time has been good for my audience  
seanhannity	708440244249620480	2016-03-11T23:51:31	Thank u. Isn't this election really about saving this country from the disaster that is liberalism?  PERSPECTIVE  
seanhannity	708440027211112454	2016-03-11T23:50:39	U r correct. Some people r pissed I have not endorsed THEIR candidate. I stand by my decision to let U decide.  
seanhannity	708439266171494400	2016-03-11T23:47:37	Later dude 
seanhannity	708439142548574210	2016-03-11T23:47:08	It's called doing my job.   
seanhannity	708438816730783744	2016-03-11T23:45:50	Totally agree. If was pushing one person I would get heat for that. I respect that people have picked trump cruz  
seanhannity	708438401708638208	2016-03-11T23:44:11	SenTedCruz supporters r not establishment. Ok I said it   But those pushing for a brokered convention ARE 
seanhannity	708437967631732736	2016-03-11T23:42:28	Wow. Thank u!! 
seanhannity	708437183930175488	2016-03-11T23:39:21	Happy Friday  
seanhannity	708437075872374784	2016-03-11T23:38:55	It's a very emotional time for people, I get that. Thank u  
seanhannity	708436949414092800	2016-03-11T23:38:25	KC. So have I!  Thank U 
seanhannity	708436806753259520	2016-03-11T23:37:51	I m@pushing nobody. I let the candidates talk--YOU DECIDE  
seanhannity	708436470210682880	2016-03-11T23:36:31	Time will tell  
seanhannity	708436378653237248	2016-03-11T23:36:09	The difference would be I WILL SUPPORT THE VOTE OF THE PEOPLE, not the establishment  
seanhannity	708436090361925632	2016-03-11T23:35:00	Excuse me. If i M running for POTUS then I am looking for votes for me. If I am losing I would get out and endorse  
seanhannity	708435752292630528	2016-03-11T23:33:40	Not illegal. A total manipulation and power grab that would ignore the will of the people. Would be a disaster 
seanhannity	708435344245530624	2016-03-11T23:32:02	I will support the person with the most delegates, even if I have to write it in  
seanhannity	708435009015848961	2016-03-11T23:30:42	I was not there. 2 reports on Breitbart now about the issue  
seanhannity	708434876077371392	2016-03-11T23:30:11	We will hopefully get there. But watch for a brokered convention.  Establishment will try and steal nomination  
seanhannity	708434671621824513	2016-03-11T23:29:22	I can make the case for both easily  
seanhannity	708434526658306048	2016-03-11T23:28:47	He has told me at least 6 times he likes healthcare savings accts. Look it up, it's on his website.  
seanhannity	708434199783432192	2016-03-11T23:27:29	And I say follow your heart. But don't let the establishment choose. Let the voters decide  
seanhannity	708433985358204928	2016-03-11T23:26:38	That's total BS. Every candidate has had a fair shot. U just don't like it that realDonaldTrump and SenTedCruz win 
seanhannity	708433675390734336	2016-03-11T23:25:24	Well then I m guilty too. I m a sinner, not a saint  
seanhannity	708433549213491200	2016-03-11T23:24:54	I have been fair to all candidates, I will respect the PEOPLES CHOICE. NOT THE ESTABLISHMENT CHOICE  
seanhannity	708433150599364608	2016-03-11T23:23:19	Lol. That's the best u have?  Unsound desperate to me 
seanhannity	708432910047682560	2016-03-11T23:22:22	Awe my feelings r so hurt.  I m a hack because I put faith in the people to decide on a candidate. Grow up  
seanhannity	708432643008937985	2016-03-11T23:21:18	Oh so the "establishment" helps create trump and Cruz and then they plot to steal the nomination from 1 of them  
seanhannity	708432086751903744	2016-03-11T23:19:06	Really?  Then stop following me 
seanhannity	708431917260120064	2016-03-11T23:18:25	Absolutely not 
seanhannity	708431694576132099	2016-03-11T23:17:32	They stand for very different things. Are u following the same election as me? 
seanhannity	708431369706315777	2016-03-11T23:16:15	I have given equal time to both 
seanhannity	708430856478724096	2016-03-11T23:14:12	If the establishment steals this?  Yup. I'll take my toys and go home  
seanhannity	708430394446712832	2016-03-11T23:12:22	Excuse me up 33% last month.  
seanhannity	708418180855693313	2016-03-11T22:23:50	Hey seanhannity were you gonna mention this?  
seanhannity	708416026455703552	2016-03-11T22:15:17	LOVED seeing CarlyFiorina, tedcruz, &amp; seanhannity this morning! watch linawatlington &amp; I on FOX @ 10 tonight!😉🇺🇸 
seanhannity	708412299967475712	2016-03-11T22:00:28	.tedcruz joins SeanHannity for the full hour in Orlando. Tune in at 10p ET! 
seanhannity	708427892598972417	2016-03-11T23:02:26	Not at all. At this stage I see no path to the nomination for them. JohnKasich agrees with me.  
seanhannity	708426814159527937	2016-03-11T22:58:09	Then follow your heart. I said that from day 1 
seanhannity	708425743643111424	2016-03-11T22:53:53	I will support the nominee with the most delegates. Not a consensus establishment choice  
seanhannity	708425320165195776	2016-03-11T22:52:12	The establishment caused this voter revolt and now they want to corrupt the process with a "consensus" candidate.  
seanhannity	708425022075961345	2016-03-11T22:51:01	Hope Hillary likes orange jumpsuits.  
seanhannity	708424920129269760	2016-03-11T22:50:37	I have not even begun my vetting of Hillary. Trust me that is coming  
seanhannity	708424747911094272	2016-03-11T22:49:56	Then a majority of people are vs every republican. That math makes zero sense  
seanhannity	708424422596681728	2016-03-11T22:48:38	And watch SenTedCruz attack realDonaldTrump tonight.  That's all fair game.  
seanhannity	708424150092812288	2016-03-11T22:47:33	My point exactly. LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE. So far they have chosen SenTedCruz and realDonaldTrump 
seanhannity	708423717643296768	2016-03-11T22:45:50	Ok then 75% 80% 85% reject the other candidates. This is now a 2 person race. realDonaldTrump and SenTedCruz 
seanhannity	708423393025064960	2016-03-11T22:44:33	This will backfire.  
seanhannity	708423116104531972	2016-03-11T22:43:27	Let SenTedCruz and realDonaldTrump fight it out. Winner should get the nomination  
seanhannity	708422838416445440	2016-03-11T22:42:21	The establishment is hoping for a brokered convention stop realDonaldTrump and SenTedCruz  DIRTY POLITICAL GAMES!! 
seanhannity	708422234298253312	2016-03-11T22:39:57	Why is marcorubio saying vote for Kasich if he is not hoping for a convention fight?  
seanhannity	708421893402054656	2016-03-11T22:38:35	If that game is played COUNT ME OUT

seanhannity	701624583137447937	2016-02-22T04:28:30	I gave every candidate an hour when they announced. Now I am offering them all again  
seanhannity	701624280933658624	2016-02-22T04:27:18	Beck and Levin r both friends. They seem to be solid Ted supporters. I do my show my way. I interview them all  
seanhannity	701623983448465408	2016-02-22T04:26:07	I get the impression u r a crybaby whose candidate is losing, so u want to blame others. Try to man up, work harder  
seanhannity	701623436070805505	2016-02-22T04:23:57	Friday night I gave Cruz and Rubio a half hour each. Trump has a full hour Monday , Cruz a full hour wed. Rubio soon

seanhannity	701621117161754628	2016-02-22T04:14:44	Thx

seanhannity	701619822308761600	2016-02-22T04:09:35	With all do respect, I have been fair to all of them, and u have no idea who I m supporting  
seanhannity	701619389355991040	2016-02-22T04:07:52	Di, I have also been nice to every candidate. I m not playing "gotcha"  they all get a chance to talk uninterrupted  
seanhannity	701618979064909824	2016-02-22T04:06:14	And u r whining because whoever u support isn't winning. So if your person loses, get your toys and go pout.  
seanhannity	701617341348651009	2016-02-22T03:59:44	Actually I m blessed with bosses that support how I choose to do my show.  
seanhannity	701616993225613314	2016-02-22T03:58:21	Then go work harder for the candidate u support. Don't question my conservatism because I give equal time  
seanhannity	701616472435593218	2016-02-22T03:56:17	I will vote for the winner of the primary over Hillary. 1000%. And if u don't, I will get a third Obama term.  
seanhannity	701615307538956288	2016-02-22T03:51:39	This is such a dumb comment. 1) I never said any such thing. 2) I have given equal time to the other candidates  
seanhannity	701297021676822528	2016-02-21T06:46:54	Thanks Pete. And on that note I m off to bed

seanhannity	701294320427659264	2016-02-21T06:36:10	So if I don't support your guy I m no longer a conservative. U have zero idea who I like

seanhannity	701292215105150976	2016-02-21T06:27:48	Patrick, some people r lashing out because their chosen candidate lost. My advice to them is work harder  
seanhannity	701291931549224960	2016-02-21T06:26:40	Instead of getting mad, pouting and blaming others. Work harder for the person u like 
seanhannity	701291703811104768	2016-02-21T06:25:46	Butter is softening!!  Good girl!

seanhannity	701290337759862784	2016-02-21T06:20:20	It's a blood sport. I have been warning people this is coming. Your guy won, my advice let it go 
seanhannity	701289907008970752	2016-02-21T06:18:37	That would be great 
seanhannity	701289790470287361	2016-02-21T06:18:10	They want to empower govt to steal it from others 
seanhannity	701289528292745216	2016-02-21T06:17:07	Not a bad idea 
seanhannity	701289384553881600	2016-02-21T06:16:33	And I never stop Cruz when he attacks Trump. Yes I let them all talk.  
seanhannity	701289179196555264	2016-02-21T06:15:44	And Ted Cruz as well
