ltabb	722088396529758208	2016-04-18T15:44:24	Agreed. Only works if IEX is only speedbump. once others are created then no one has accurate price 
ltabb	722035641895280640	2016-04-18T12:14:46	It doesn't -  Imho.  Reduces determinism. Harder to ascertain right price. Only IEX will know right price  
ltabb	722035046325096449	2016-04-18T12:12:24	Gives IEX more time to determine right midpoint so it reduces adverse selection &amp; risk of being picked off 
ltabb	721875220194279424	2016-04-18T01:37:18	Came to same conclusion. That said - interesting and need to read closer.

ltabb	721867076068065280	2016-04-18T01:04:57	Shouldn't be about iex should be about best market structure. If IEX speedbump is good then why aren't others?

ltabb	712449133777276928	2016-03-23T01:21:24	mechmarkets good question. I think it's good for ATSs. Mkt maker quotes will be wider as prices less definitive. Midpoints more valued

ltabb	712434018973671424	2016-03-23T00:21:21	mechmarkets maybe - would have to be done via order type. Having 2 matching models in same exch may be problem. But there are rlps,so maybe
ltabb	712433015851331584	2016-03-23T00:17:22	Agree. I think sb mkts will have natural caps - RT Mkts will maintain maj of flow. Maybe 20% total but that's a swag 
ltabb	712432086976573441	2016-03-23T00:13:40	mechmarkets not sure high vol exch will employ sb. At EoD mkt makers want 2 trade. Best reliable prices &amp; comp will drive flow&amp;share
ltabb	712422247567261697	2016-03-22T23:34:34	Agree completely. Still first in first out - just 350 micros later. 4 a more interesting SB model look at PDQ_ATS 
ltabb	712415650686193664	2016-03-22T23:08:21	U need aggressive quotes - few will aggressively quote w/o rebate. But will get SIP data fees &amp; lower clearing fees

ltabb	705103033626206208	2016-03-02T18:50:38	mechmarkets I think so. somehow there is another 350bump if you route. so instead of bypassing bump w/routing it goes over bump 2x

ltabb	704813478557655045	2016-03-01T23:40:02	yes but... traders like finality. I would doubt many would go to market w/LL when there is a wysiwyg market 
ltabb	704812806303031296	2016-03-01T23:37:22	Absolutely right but opportunity costs would be high. Can you imagine - 100 shares dked cause markets moved? yuck!  
ltabb	704811793550548993	2016-03-01T23:33:21	LL is appropriate when U use capital. Its an accommodation. if U guarantee capital - U don't deserve to be hosed

ltabb	685636300909744128	2016-01-09T01:36:47	nanexllc Y. LT investors... I agree. Mkt should be tipped toward investors. But tight quoting makes it cheaper for investors.
ltabb	685635455291944960	2016-01-09T01:33:25	nanexllc I am not saying anything like that. But if my ex quality sucks then my broker should be fired. been saying this for years
ltabb	685635147438374912	2016-01-09T01:32:12	nanexllc If that is basis, then SEC will approve IEX &amp; if mkt complexity increases - maybe that's a good. More confusion may = larger size
ltabb	685633012478926850	2016-01-09T01:23:43	nanexllc true - but if the taker was quicker... And if not - then that becomes a spoofing issue that hopefully FINRA would take issue with

ltabb	685630928568332288	2016-01-09T01:15:26	nanexllc what nyse deal? love to hear about it
ltabb	685630675899314176	2016-01-09T01:14:26	nanexllc ? so you light up a quote at XYX. If I am quick enough &amp; go direct w/o dp or some other thing - I can't get that quote?
ltabb	685630103498440705	2016-01-09T01:12:09	nanexllc Yes it is. But exch rules set by regs. If SEC says IEX is cool then great. it may cause other issues but mkt will figure it out
ltabb	685629565427937281	2016-01-09T01:10:01	nanexllc every quote is real. the challenge is accessing it quickly &amp; directly. Seems like a data, routing, connectivity &amp; tech prob
ltabb	685628706119880706	2016-01-09T01:06:36	nanexllc best idea - better data,  measurement,  transparency, &amp; analytics so you can avoid the folks that suck! Transparency &amp; competition
ltabb	685628218418827264	2016-01-09T01:04:40	nanexllc Also what if NDAQ/Arca... put in their own speed bumps? wouldn't that defeat IEX router advantage?
ltabb	685627876671143936	2016-01-09T01:03:18	nanexllc Ok say IEX is approvied as is. Won't others follow w/slightly different models? Won't it be harder to know what is real?
ltabb	685624517272670215	2016-01-09T00:49:57	nanexllc What is alternative? specialists? Old mkt maker system? Wider tick? Synch sip &amp; DF (that I am for)? Ban computers? How do we fix?
ltabb	685623933165527041	2016-01-09T00:47:38	nanexllc what will I see? quick cxlled quotes? prints outside nbbo? lots of routing? I know  this happens. We measure it. Not all nefarious
ltabb	685596254743728128	2016-01-08T22:57:39	nanexllc IEX elnunesio Biggest issue I think would be funky midpoint prints in moving mkt. not sure how regulators would  would like that
ltabb	685595521852010498	2016-01-08T22:54:44	nanexllc IEX elnunesio as for dropping 350u &amp; routing concurrently (ndaq) it gets rid of some Larb, but IEX prob wants more protection
ltabb	685594732639174656	2016-01-08T22:51:36	nanexllc IEX elnunesio if I were the midpoint guy - I would probably be pissed
ltabb	685594355667701760	2016-01-08T22:50:06	nanexllc IEX elnunesio challenge would be you may have funky executions in a moving mkt where mid ex would look outside of nbbo
ltabb	685594037273935872	2016-01-08T22:48:50	nanexllc IEX elnunesio Agree that IEX coil mostly benefits midpoint orders. having RT lit vs. delayed midpt is interesting idea.
ltabb	685593603612225536	2016-01-08T22:47:07	nanexllc IEX elnunesio Adam is right that IEX is against latency arb in IEX but router setup enables IEX to do latency arb on other mkts
ltabb	685583118825295873	2016-01-08T22:05:27	nanexllc IEX love your take.
ltabb	685521998831841280	2016-01-08T18:02:35	This is a really good and thoughtful piece on the IEX Exchange application. Nice job elnunesio

ltabb	684127435353387008	2016-01-04T21:41:05	mkt_strctr_guy it is personal. I am tired of folks saying, without data, that the mkt is rigged &amp; mkt s/b for large institutions

ltabb	684120395847446528	2016-01-04T21:13:07	ChicagoPhotoSho nanexllc that would be  great. But then it pushes you to 1 exchange, or all in same DC, 1 telco provider...no competition
ltabb	684119845361848320	2016-01-04T21:10:56	agthreesixty I assume they're fighting for their view of a better market for them (pro $ mgr). But is it better for all? Not easy decision.
ltabb	684116288868872192	2016-01-04T20:56:48	agthreesixty mechmarkets AlgoTrdr The question is for who? For me buying 100 shares or a pro investor buying 1m shares. Hard to do both
ltabb	684115858369736704	2016-01-04T20:55:05	nanexllc ChicagoPhotoSho I agree-that is the crux of the decision the SEC needs to make. Does the bump impact or facilitate fair markets?
ltabb	684113905283629056	2016-01-04T20:47:19	ChicagoPhotoSho nanexllc The speed bump - may impact order protection, &amp; router may violate fair access. Up to the SEC to opine
ltabb	684110695449923584	2016-01-04T20:34:34	Zatara5555 nanexllc ?
ltabb	684109471493304320	2016-01-04T20:29:42	ChicagoPhotoSho nanexllc I am not against IEX. They should just play by the SEC rules like everyone else - also stop spreading falsehoods
ltabb	684108972325007360	2016-01-04T20:27:43	nanexllc nope
ltabb	684106676518162432	2016-01-04T20:18:36	AlgoTrdr mechmarkets really intersting blog post - thx for sharing.
ltabb	684104303443886081	2016-01-04T20:09:10	mechmarkets AlgoTrdr Yale agreed - but why are they piping out if they don't understand? Without dets, how can U create a better market?
ltabb	684102199211900930	2016-01-04T20:00:48	mechmarkets AlgoTrdr Yale What does that say for them as a fiduciary/money mgr? They don't understand the market they are investing in?
ltabb	684101117094047745	2016-01-04T19:56:30	mechmarkets AlgoTrdr Yale This would be an interesting discussion but really hard to entertain in 140 character snippets
ltabb	684100370210111489	2016-01-04T19:53:32	mechmarkets AlgoTrdr Yale I think they're "believers" &amp; there are mkt structure prob, but to sow fear, they're uninformed or talking book
ltabb	684098507028959233	2016-01-04T19:46:08	mechmarkets AlgoTrdr Yale By that measure why don't they just invest in any crappy equity? I assume they expt $ from all their invtmts
ltabb	684097431122919425	2016-01-04T19:41:52	mechmarkets AlgoTrdr Yale They have a fid resp to protect investments. Are they biased...? A mkt to execute size benefits them not retail

ltabb	680414770546216960	2015-12-25T15:48:17	Agreed.  Why is the NYT taking a onesided view? I submited a rebuttle but I was dked. Don't take rebuttals on OpEds 
ltabb	680070087320154112	2015-12-24T16:58:38	very funny. I guess eveyone wants to get their eoy revs. up :-) 
ltabb	680065334183870464	2015-12-24T16:39:45	its not bad. market data is a mess &amp; very expensive. A better SIP would be good for all - except maybe exchanges 
ltabb	679027597833965569	2015-12-21T19:56:09	ThemisSal isn't that about this issue of finra historically tying best ex routing to the SIP given its tape of record?
ltabb	678968873513693185	2015-12-21T16:02:48	mechmarkets RGNewJr ThemisSal DLauer Good question for SEC enforcement. Either way - sb same rules for all players
ltabb	678964843123097600	2015-12-21T15:46:47	mechmarkets RGNewJr ThemisSal DLauer Not the point. SEC allowed it so why should SEC deny IEX? Retroactive DK = poor policy.
ltabb	678964266397863936	2015-12-21T15:44:30	mechmarkets DLauer hard to explain in 140 characters - but if you route - its a broker function and SEC treats you as a broker.
ltabb	678962309117566977	2015-12-21T15:36:43	mechmarkets RGNewJr ThemisSal DLauer My tech sucks shouldn't be an argument
ltabb	678961806451183616	2015-12-21T15:34:43	mechmarkets ThemisSal RGNewJr DLauer Looks like u r right. if that's case then can't use router as argument. its either level or not
ltabb	678955748857012224	2015-12-21T15:10:39	mechmarkets DLauer Exch ME should have no exposure-B net S. When u route- u hv exch ctp risk. Exch risk needs to be netted via ccp, ie bkr
ltabb	678949940257624064	2015-12-21T14:47:34	mechmarkets DLauer Exch need to route cause of NMS Order Protection &amp; routing because of clearing needs to be in seperate B/D
ltabb	678949431073308677	2015-12-21T14:45:33	mechmarkets DLauer yes but that's just competition. If folks invest to compete &amp; on fair playing field-u can't be upset when they compete
ltabb	678947375470129152	2015-12-21T14:37:23	mechmarkets DLauer my issue is fairness. if exchanges pref own routers...why can't IEX? doesn't matter if others are crap. that's just IT
ltabb	678694244924710912	2015-12-20T21:51:32	DLauer mechmarkets ThemisSal RGNewJr Ok so really it doesn't matter cause they suck? And the ~10microsecond advantage is a non issue.
