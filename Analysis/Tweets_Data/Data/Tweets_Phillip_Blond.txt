Phillip_Blond	712365331667410944	2016-03-22T19:48:24	The dilemma of mainstream Sunni Islam is that like Protestantism they lack the institutional power to shape an authorised tradition
Phillip_Blond	712365148888035329	2016-03-22T19:47:41	Or in other words Sunni Islam needs a papacy to control and condemn extremist readings and practices

Phillip_Blond	683735157208133633	2016-01-03T19:42:19	ericdaryl evidently so
Phillip_Blond	683734568164323328	2016-01-03T19:39:58	ericdaryl now you prize ignorance and keep it precious -whatever keeps you pious
Phillip_Blond	683734201145933825	2016-01-03T19:38:31	ericdaryl the British global war on slavery for instance was stunning - over 160,000 slaves freed by RN - impossible without empire
Phillip_Blond	683733770911006721	2016-01-03T19:36:48	ericdaryl u would also need to give an account that didn't sound so deeply ideological - and account for the good that empire also brought
Phillip_Blond	683733241342365696	2016-01-03T19:34:42	ericdaryl well you would need to differentiate between different types of imperialism some terrible others less so
Phillip_Blond	683732790999957505	2016-01-03T19:32:55	ericdaryl I was arguing everything is really empire or the result of it and the conflict is between good and bad variants of the same
Phillip_Blond	683731170018856960	2016-01-03T19:26:28	ericdaryl I am afraid you really are - it's dire unfortunately
Phillip_Blond	683731057049497601	2016-01-03T19:26:01	ericdaryl one very simple example the  Austro-Hungarian empire and Serbia a multi-ethnic state destroyed by nationalism leading to WW1
Phillip_Blond	683730716547530752	2016-01-03T19:24:40	ericdaryl hence once again it's the destruction of empires that leads to nationalism and racism
Phillip_Blond	683730581893562368	2016-01-03T19:24:08	ericdaryl first use of modern racism in Europe was Spain and the purity of blood following the reconquest
Phillip_Blond	683730297419075584	2016-01-03T19:23:00	ericdaryl and it was the attempt by European monarchs to be popes in their own country that produced European racism and nationalism
Phillip_Blond	683730027314307072	2016-01-03T19:21:56	ericdaryl that lasted 3 centuries &amp; produced subjugation of monarchs to the pope it was broken in 14th century by murder of Boniface VIII
Phillip_Blond	683729528997416960	2016-01-03T19:19:57	ericdaryl Christianity through the peace of God movement &amp; the Papacy disarmed Europe in the 9th &amp; 10th century producing Christian empire
Phillip_Blond	683729033616601088	2016-01-03T19:17:59	ericdaryl you really don't know your history do you - the idea of race emerged from the breakup of the Christian Catholic empire in 14th C
Phillip_Blond	683728327501287424	2016-01-03T19:15:10	ericdaryl if you struggle with the idea that empires can and do produce peace ask yourself what the cost of nationalism is
Phillip_Blond	683727089833500672	2016-01-03T19:10:15	mayngo2 ericdaryl well for me Israel is in Europe not least because at time of Christ the Southern Mediterranean was in Roman hands
Phillip_Blond	683726501024370688	2016-01-03T19:07:55	ericdaryl the history of humanity is the history of empire - without it we would still be in kith and kin groups engaging in tribal murder
Phillip_Blond	683726013713510400	2016-01-03T19:05:59	ericdaryl ahistorical partial and dangerous reading the legacy of empire was also transcending race and tribe, democracy and institutions
Phillip_Blond	683725108360409088	2016-01-03T19:02:23	.ericdaryl many good things eg Christianity 2 human rights 2 care for the environment fulfil definitions of 'imperialism' yet we like them
Phillip_Blond	683723773854543872	2016-01-03T18:57:05	.ericdaryl all this stuff produces is a self hating culture that cannot universalise anymore so we become impotent in the face of evil
Phillip_Blond	683722644378796032	2016-01-03T18:52:36	ericdaryl nobody is arguing for minimising that but these wild generalisations that are thrown around blind people to the past &amp; the future
Phillip_Blond	683715228165619714	2016-01-03T18:23:07	djuricnikola yes indeed did you enjoy it
Phillip_Blond	683715033457672194	2016-01-03T18:22:21	ericdaryl yes your right all empire is evil, everything European is mass murder - good grief
Phillip_Blond	683714098484363264	2016-01-03T18:18:38	JosephKay76 but let's continue this discussion as it is fascinating at a conference or some such locale
Phillip_Blond	683713925842616320	2016-01-03T18:17:57	JosephKay76 needless to say I think whilst this take has some merit that is at the price of surrendering correspondence with coherence
Phillip_Blond	683709573048459265	2016-01-03T18:00:39	MatthewHillsays Gilesyb it's a little a historical let's say that
Phillip_Blond	683709434552541184	2016-01-03T18:00:06	Tom_Gann I just think it's a very reductive way to understand imperialism it's not the only conceptual way to interrogate the phenomenon
Phillip_Blond	683705609452130304	2016-01-03T17:44:54	Tom_Gann oh god the language of extracting value it's the other way round India drained money from the British state
Phillip_Blond	683703683213832192	2016-01-03T17:37:15	JosephKay76 still bad determinist Marxism, opposition 2 slavery could never be ethical (which it was) had 2 serve hidden economic interest
Phillip_Blond	683703069461327872	2016-01-03T17:34:49	JosephKay76 but thanks for the conversation most enjoyable
Phillip_Blond	683702984946106368	2016-01-03T17:34:28	tedjbaldwin Gilesyb history is never just about sentimentality it creates or blocks pathways to the future
Phillip_Blond	683702466857295872	2016-01-03T17:32:25	JosephKay76 a case of desperately trying to find a Marxist explanation I suspect - it doesn't apply in this case
Phillip_Blond	683702186300313601	2016-01-03T17:31:18	kindofwater that's what losing an argument looks like
Phillip_Blond	683702082562605057	2016-01-03T17:30:53	Tom_Gann silly history it was Indian cotton that destroyed the British textile industry at end of 19th century
Phillip_Blond	683701805105188864	2016-01-03T17:29:47	Tom_Gann one sixth of the Royal Navy were deployed on anti slavery duty on West African coast they bordered American ships &amp; freed slaves
Phillip_Blond	683701257752735749	2016-01-03T17:27:37	kindofwater you then have to ask yourself if it was simply a nationalist project why so many democracies where it's legacy
Phillip_Blond	683700983998865408	2016-01-03T17:26:31	.JosephKay76 when Britain won Napoleonic war it insisted on an anti-slavery statute at council of Vienna  1st int human rights legislation
Phillip_Blond	683697510255333377	2016-01-03T17:12:43	MOOMISM TinMachineII thanks for this but again it's too simplistic in my view - colonialism probably inevitable ? Is by whom and how
Phillip_Blond	683697129433489409	2016-01-03T17:11:12	Tom_Gann kindofwater not sure I agree indeed it was the British position that stimulated slave owners to revolt
Phillip_Blond	683696679833497601	2016-01-03T17:09:25	MHallward Gilesyb I am an admirer of Giles' which is why I enjoy discussing things with him
Phillip_Blond	683696349695623169	2016-01-03T17:08:06	kindofwater a longer conversation but not everything people do beyond their borders is reducible to nationalism
Phillip_Blond	683695454903791616	2016-01-03T17:04:33	TinMachineII MOOMISM sure but the point remains if you want a balanced view you have to also quote those who resisted such ideas and won
Phillip_Blond	683694509390192640	2016-01-03T17:00:48	JosephKay76 BuskingWomble you make my point for me - British opposition not reversed - it was sustained and enforced
Phillip_Blond	683694323326648320	2016-01-03T17:00:03	TinMachineII MOOMISM I am sure that is true but they were only part of history - it's like just quoting from one side in a war
Phillip_Blond	683693621313433602	2016-01-03T16:57:16	kindofwater in its 19th century form British Empire conducted the first global war for the rights of man - it made global war on slavery
Phillip_Blond	683693046693756930	2016-01-03T16:54:59	JosephKay76 BuskingWomble I think your times lines are a bit mixed up here - Britain was fighting a global war against the slavers

Phillip_Blond	683691880106823681	2016-01-03T16:50:21	MOOMISM oh that's just infantile stuff nobody adult believes that unless you say that Europeans travelling and trading was murder
Phillip_Blond	683691504611758082	2016-01-03T16:48:51	kindofwater MatthewHillsays no Alex that's just wrong I am afraid not all empires are simply nationalist
Phillip_Blond	683691300458201089	2016-01-03T16:48:03	MarikaRose it was British judgment that slavery was against the common law that provoked American Revolution see Somerset v Stewart (1772)

Phillip_Blond	683690360376287232	2016-01-03T16:44:18	JosephKay76 BuskingWomble you also have to give the account of Britain's decades long global military battle against slavery
Phillip_Blond	683690133141483521	2016-01-03T16:43:24	MOOMISM doesn't get it right in my view
Phillip_Blond	683687039653548033	2016-01-03T16:31:07	MOOMISM I have and many other things besides - it's a poor unbalanced book I am afraid
Phillip_Blond	683686828776501250	2016-01-03T16:30:16	JosephKay76 BuskingWomble it's a mixed history like all history but it's not just all bad

Phillip_Blond	683603269537689600	2016-01-03T10:58:14	.MatthewHillsays I would say in the modern period nationalism is the great mass killer of people - a civic empire is its antidote

Phillip_Blond	683600485778087936	2016-01-03T10:47:11	MatthewHillsays not sure this is all true - need to separate several issues here and ask if empire mitigated or exacerbated these trends

Phillip_Blond	683596752176427009	2016-01-03T10:32:20	Phillip_Blond BuskingWomble Yes. Compare Canada- an empire developed under lawful authority and US- one developed in rebellion against it.
