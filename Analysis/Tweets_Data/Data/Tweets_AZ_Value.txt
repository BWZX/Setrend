AZ_Value	684547417610534913	2016-01-06T01:29:57	DorsiaCapital believe stupid stories like that. At least go check out what others have and measure it against VRX own products. That's the
AZ_Value	684547270000406528	2016-01-06T01:29:22	DorsiaCapital It's as if Pfizer, Merck, JNJ, Bayer, waited for Pearson to show up to get in the OTC business. That just shows laziness to
AZ_Value	684546918681329665	2016-01-06T01:27:58	DorsiaCapital can say a couple of BL products. And yet they always repeat the same idiotic talking point, But they have OTCs and stuff man
AZ_Value	684546576384176128	2016-01-06T01:26:36	DorsiaCapital they couldn't say Cerave. Nearly all of them were incapable, at least after the BL deal enough people were glasses so they

AZ_Value	684545509512622084	2016-01-06T01:22:22	DorsiaCapital Would have taught you all you needed to know about the claims they make versus the reality.
AZ_Value	684545401953857536	2016-01-06T01:21:56	DorsiaCapital There were hundreds and hundreds of letters. One could have picked just a couple in your area and went to talk to them.
AZ_Value	684545103080349696	2016-01-06T01:20:45	DorsiaCapital  And taken the time to go talk to physicians instead of looking at shiny PPT presentations.

AZ_Value	684543323948847104	2016-01-06T01:13:41	DorsiaCapital So if you fired some people and then realized you had to hire new ones because it killed the business, were those synergies?
AZ_Value	684543076036165632	2016-01-06T01:12:42	DorsiaCapital business collapsed. But worry not. We've learned. And we went to hire some other ones so all is good we promise.
AZ_Value	684542904065482752	2016-01-06T01:12:01	DorsiaCapital If you remember for MRX, AGN called them out on it and the excuse was we really didn't know.. we fire all their reps and then
AZ_Value	684542715783196672	2016-01-06T01:11:16	DorsiaCapital But there's also others that have an effect on the numbers we were discussing. Just firing people left and right.
AZ_Value	684542442717200385	2016-01-06T01:10:11	DorsiaCapital All pharma execs are capable of doing that. They just don't because they're not idiots. They have the lg term to worry about
AZ_Value	684542305680928769	2016-01-06T01:09:38	DorsiaCapital The only obvious one has always been taking over and driving R&amp;D spend to zero or thereabouts. No super insight there
AZ_Value	684527741983698944	2016-01-06T00:11:46	QuoththeRavenSA find it quite unfair that you would leave MarioLopezExtra out. He's the one driving growth at VRX 
AZ_Value	684441772777287680	2016-01-05T18:30:09	DorsiaCapital In fact once u've analyzed numbers, u'll be a better judge of personalities IMO because you'll know who's lying /end rant
AZ_Value	684441493440839684	2016-01-05T18:29:03	DorsiaCapital Who wouldn't want a CEO to be conservative after all, right? Moral of story: Analyze numbers not personalities!!
AZ_Value	684441145963720704	2016-01-05T18:27:40	DorsiaCapital Because you're "Conservative". BS. But that's the kind of stuff that makes those who didn't do the numbers feel good. /26
AZ_Value	684440817713336320	2016-01-05T18:26:21	DorsiaCapital You cannot simultaneously brag about achieving billions in synergies while saying I can't see the bottom line effect /25
AZ_Value	684440607012466688	2016-01-05T18:25:31	DorsiaCapital With all due respect to him, that's nothing but f'ing bullshit. it doesn't work like that. Math doesn't work like that /24
AZ_Value	684440251549364224	2016-01-05T18:24:06	DorsiaCapital And Pearson's answer is essentially the reason why people will lose money on this. He's a charlatan that just says stuff /23
AZ_Value	684440013623312384	2016-01-05T18:23:10	DorsiaCapital That exchange says a lot. Because I had done the numbers I was looking for answers and hoping sell side guys would ask /22
AZ_Value	684439475577982977	2016-01-05T18:21:01	DorsiaCapital In fact once you've done the numbers on your own. You can then really see the people for who they are 
AZ_Value	684438498405781505	2016-01-05T18:17:08	DorsiaCapital The real point is that people analyzed a story and personalities before they analyzed numbers and thats a recipe for disaster
AZ_Value	684438072507797505	2016-01-05T18:15:27	DorsiaCapital But it isn't. You'll see if you do the math. And I know what the real answer is btw but that's beside the point really. /19
AZ_Value	684437072069840896	2016-01-05T18:11:28	DorsiaCapital add all those cost cuts and explain that bottom line trend. Answer could be rising interest exp. with ballooning debt /18

AZ_Value	684435997753380864	2016-01-05T18:07:12	DorsiaCapital This is essentially the crux of that WallStCynic tweet. Simply by doing the numbers anyone would have uncovered the lies /15
AZ_Value	684435649835839488	2016-01-05T18:05:49	DorsiaCapital That your cash earnings margin would be collapsing?? Forget about keeping it constant. It should be rising by a lot /14
AZ_Value	684435191738150913	2016-01-05T18:04:00	DorsiaCapital the whole damn thing falls apart. What should we expect if you cut combined Opex by 52-27-34%?? /13 
AZ_Value	684434199948832769	2016-01-05T18:00:04	DorsiaCapital And simply what you'd expect the bottom line to look like with those cost savings year after year and you'd see that /12

AZ_Value	684431296865501184	2016-01-05T17:48:31	DorsiaCapital It's simply by using their own s. And simply ask why is their earnings margin constantly declining? 
AZ_Value	684430209827778560	2016-01-05T17:44:12	DorsiaCapital And you get found out very quickly if you don't spend on CAPEX However I can show you another way to question their claims /7
AZ_Value	684429781656408064	2016-01-05T17:42:30	DorsiaCapital What you're trying to do is tough as they've never stayed idle simply because they couldn't. Acquisitions is their CAPEX /6
AZ_Value	684429472867598336	2016-01-05T17:41:17	DorsiaCapital But not a single one went beyond quoting some number like $900M in cost savings. Never ever actually showed us actual s /5
AZ_Value	684429017877884928	2016-01-05T17:39:28	DorsiaCapital cool looking presentations about VRX that would just state that Pearson is so good that he over-achieves on synergies and /4
AZ_Value	684428626951966720	2016-01-05T17:37:55	DorsiaCapital He said sthg like "Remember that VRX is a numbers story". It's the same situation with synergies. I've seen a million /3
AZ_Value	684428093155508224	2016-01-05T17:35:48	DorsiaCapital I remember a few weeks ago one of those tweets by WallStCynic that encompass the whole story &amp; no one paid attention to it
AZ_Value	684427438302990336	2016-01-05T17:33:11	DorsiaCapital Yep. You've definitely got the right thinking on this. Just ask basic questions and this whole VRX story unravels quickly
AZ_Value	681936659131174912	2015-12-29T20:35:43	DorsiaCapital Already done that. Part of the remaining installments I decided to pull the plug on. You've got the right thinking on this
AZ_Value	681935513943539712	2015-12-29T20:31:10	DorsiaCapital I appreciated dropping the @. Life is too short to be spent arguing with folks in denial.
AZ_Value	681935092038504448	2015-12-29T20:29:30	DorsiaCapital Anyways. Just wanted to point out that you essentially had picked on a big point about these companies but read it wrong

AZ_Value	681933313179713540	2015-12-29T20:22:26	DorsiaCapital And you can actually separate out the companies that I call "Pharmagimmicks" companies vs the rest. What everyone calls the

AZ_Value	681932680661872640	2015-12-29T20:19:55	DorsiaCapital And since they won't make $ on most of that, set up $650M in additional contra revenue reserves which is what u picked upon
