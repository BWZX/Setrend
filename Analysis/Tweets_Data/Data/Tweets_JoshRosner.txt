JoshRosner	721118197211086848	2016-04-15T23:29:10	Ny1david pickfair50 if the best you have is partisanship and can't be objective we have nothing more to discuss.
JoshRosner	721118093427257344	2016-04-15T23:28:45	Ny1david pickfair50 Paulson didn't propose permanent wind down if GSEs called for reduction in portfolios. 3rd amendment was the sweep
JoshRosner	721117770948177922	2016-04-15T23:27:28	Ny1david pickfair50 your point? He stated a fact. HERA was consensus &amp; blocked status quo ante. He proposed a utility model. Not Geithner
JoshRosner	721112163167944704	2016-04-15T23:05:11	Ny1david pickfair50 So much for a real response to my points.
JoshRosner	721111888281673728	2016-04-15T23:04:06	Ny1david pickfair50 you started saying he said they should remain private. He said respect priority &amp; c'ship temp. Geithner stole the GSEs

JoshRosner	721041761007603712	2016-04-15T18:25:26	Ny1david pickfair50 Did Paulson say C'ship was temporary &amp; acknowledge capital structure priority? Did Geithner? 
JoshRosner	721040327235149824	2016-04-15T18:19:44	Ny1david pickfair50 David, I have as little patience for left wing partisan hacks as I do for right wing partisan hacks. Facts are facts.
JoshRosner	721040136549437440	2016-04-15T18:18:59	Ny1david pickfair50 Are you saying Geithner wasn't the one who made it permanent?
JoshRosner	721040015170494464	2016-04-15T18:18:30	Ny1david pickfair50 No, views in 08 &amp; 09 were conservatorship is temporary, in 09 that a utility made sense.
JoshRosner	721031783542820865	2016-04-15T17:45:47	Ny1david pickfair50 Can people grow/evolve? Didn't he always say conservatorship was temporary? Wasn't it Geithner who made it permanent?
