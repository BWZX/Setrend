AmandaMarcotte	684490020837847041	2016-01-05T21:41:52	 I knew conservatives would be skeptical that anyone would actually cry over murdered 6-year-olds. Sigh.
AmandaMarcotte	684452978032533504	2016-01-05T19:14:41	 Obama cries during his speech on guns and makes a compelling case that we can get reasonable restrictions passed.
AmandaMarcotte	684449822376652800	2016-01-05T19:02:08	Call me when conservatives stop with meaningless words about guns and start explaining why you should be able to dodge a background check.

AmandaMarcotte	684446775957139460	2016-01-05T18:50:02	 Wanting the federal government to give you millions in free land =/ not wanting to get shot by cops.
AmandaMarcotte	684413043279814656	2016-01-05T16:35:59	 Conservative reaction to Obama‚Äôs entirely sensible gun control ideas is to try to stoke panic in the streets.

AmandaMarcotte	684384737067143168	2016-01-05T14:43:31	AmandaMarcotte "Defeat" and "enemies" buy in to the inherently opressive semantics of the Other. Better to "subsume" our "mirror-selves."
AmandaMarcotte	684384077856780288	2016-01-05T14:40:54	Most rape accusations don‚Äôt come with a side dish of false accusations of murder, but the ones against Clinton do. Mitigating factor.
AmandaMarcotte	684383056812204032	2016-01-05T14:36:50	 The claim, re: Bill Clinton, that feminists want every accusation, no matter how implausible, believed is nonsense.
AmandaMarcotte	684382484692373504	2016-01-05T14:34:34	 False rape accusations are uncommon. False criminal accusations against Clintons, however, are common as dirt.
AmandaMarcotte	684381839176429570	2016-01-05T14:32:00	But there is a not inconsequential danger that doing that will cause readers to believe there‚Äôs a separate situation in Nevada.

AmandaMarcotte	684381260492488704	2016-01-05T14:29:42	Okay, the liberal obsession with the idea that minor wording changes will defeat our enemies is getting really, really out of control.

AmandaMarcotte	684139050920472576	2016-01-04T22:27:15	MTFIII I call right wing terrorists by that name. But the notion that "militia" doesn't conjure negative connotations is asinine.
AmandaMarcotte	684138529258090496	2016-01-04T22:25:10	MTFIII I'm a little unclear why they are defensive about calling someone a "terrorist" who commits terrorism, tho.
AmandaMarcotte	684137543516946436	2016-01-04T22:21:15	 I agree with this. The show will finish the story, and I don‚Äôt see why that‚Äôs a bad thing, under the circumstances.
AmandaMarcotte	684136183023140871	2016-01-04T22:15:51	I mean, too bad Twitter wasn‚Äôt around in the 90s. We could have stopped Timothy McVeigh by  demanding the disuse of the word ‚Äúmilitia‚Äù.

AmandaMarcotte	684133001689694209	2016-01-04T22:03:12	 One last reminder: Under the rhetoric of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù, the Oregon militia is greed heads demanding free stuff.
AmandaMarcotte	684130112359559168	2016-01-04T21:51:43	Obama can't stop ISIS with the phrase ‚Äúradical Islam‚Äù. Nor is there magical stopping force to the word ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù instead of ‚Äúmilitia‚Äù.

AmandaMarcotte	684109919973437441	2016-01-04T20:31:29	 Fox perpetuates the myth that demanding the government gives you free land is resisting government overreach.

AmandaMarcotte	684082811637252097	2016-01-04T18:43:46	 The Oregon militia, like Trump‚Äôs supporters, wants government handouts for white conservatives and no one else.

AmandaMarcotte	683358923861192704	2016-01-02T18:47:18	chris_amundsen He will be revising instead of writing until he dies. It's a shame, but I would be shocked if anything else happens.
AmandaMarcotte	683358833004134400	2016-01-02T18:46:56	chris_amundsen He admits in the post a lot of his time is revising. Which means those "hundreds" of pages are scrap.
AmandaMarcotte	683358711130255361	2016-01-02T18:46:27	chris_amundsen Because, as a writer, I can smell the excuses someone makes for themselves. Writing in circles is not writing to a finish.
