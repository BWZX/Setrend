TheTweetOfGod	684430001463246848	2016-01-05T17:43:23	No other organization in the world has done more to promote gun killings than the NRA.  
TheTweetOfGod	684424290075340800	2016-01-05T17:20:41	Funny how NRA invokes protecting the civil liberties of Americans while helping to kill thousands of them.

TheTweetOfGod	678780386973847552	2015-12-21T03:33:50	Steve Harvey just made MissUniverse2015 more of a joke than it already was, which in theory should not be possible.

TheTweetOfGod	675006789650243585	2015-12-10T17:38:54	He who knows, does not speak. He who speaks, does not know. Shut up, is what I'm saying.
TheTweetOfGod	674756284231499777	2015-12-10T01:03:29	You are your own punishment.
TheTweetOfGod	674300559344668672	2015-12-08T18:52:35	Donald Trump is a huge asshole who is ahead in the polls because millions and millions of Americans are also huge assholes.

TheTweetOfGod	672451181285785600	2015-12-03T16:23:49	Every new day is another chance to lose faith in humanity.
TheTweetOfGod	672241986649255936	2015-12-03T02:32:33	Correct. 
TheTweetOfGod	672174167832170496	2015-12-02T22:03:04	Stop praying. I'm clearly not listening.
TheTweetOfGod	671918108018216961	2015-12-02T05:05:35	You are all ridiculous.
