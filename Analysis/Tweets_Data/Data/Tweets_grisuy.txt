grisuy	721882668967849985	2016-04-18T02:06:54	pnuts_mama Genx13 so we have a reasonable primary rule but an awful voter ID law. Fucking New England üôÑ
grisuy	721882492454703104	2016-04-18T02:06:12	pnuts_mama Genx13 yup. In RI you can decide the day of but you cannot change your affiliation for 30 days after
grisuy	721881937003048960	2016-04-18T02:04:00	pnuts_mama Genx13 Yup, the party members should pick their candidate.
grisuy	721881642160295937	2016-04-18T02:02:50	pnuts_mama Genx13 and I think voting hours are bad overall but after Europe with its Sunday voting well I'm all why can't we do that
grisuy	721881499449040902	2016-04-18T02:02:16	pnuts_mama Genx13 I think the primary registration deadline is unnecessarily early. Who is checking that 6+ months before?
grisuy	721881007213948928	2016-04-18T02:00:18	Genx13 yup a lot of people are learning how much of election details &amp; rules are decided by a small group of people
grisuy	721880789487632385	2016-04-18T01:59:26	pnuts_mama Genx13 exactly, bugs me is this idea it's part of voter ID push or it's about Bernie. It's just bad policy no one cared before

grisuy	721879091679490050	2016-04-18T01:52:41	Genx13 the reduced hours also BS but I think it's important to place this in context of why we need to care about who sets the rules
grisuy	721878945738661889	2016-04-18T01:52:07	Genx13 I think 6 months is way to long and support a change but I don't think it's akin to voter ID laws which disenfranchise people
grisuy	721878818806501376	2016-04-18T01:51:36	Genx13 fair but I mean I often don't vote in primaries because I like remaining unaffiliated.
grisuy	721876711994966016	2016-04-18T01:43:14	Genx13 but not getting to vote in the primary of the party you are not a registered member of well I can only be so sympathetic
grisuy	721876401620676608	2016-04-18T01:42:00	Genx13 I'm with them on the hours but the needing to register early, this isn't new &amp; hey maybe argue to change it
grisuy	721876154475384832	2016-04-18T01:41:01	grisuy  the reduced hours do seem excessively harsh.  But for both sides.  Unless the theory is that Hillary voters don't have jobs.
grisuy	721875416630358016	2016-04-18T01:38:05	Lumping this is with voter ID laws is a stretch.

grisuy	720805921450950657	2016-04-15T02:48:18	You can "Westernize" the story if you want, but at that point it is no longer Ghost In The Shell because the story is simply not Western.
grisuy	720805393966870528	2016-04-15T02:46:12	This casting is not only the erasure of Asian faces but a removal of the story from its core themes.

grisuy	718289453333274624	2016-04-08T04:08:45	And so far the only discernable difference is when it's convenient as a shield against criticism. But I guess that's politics.
grisuy	718289229340635137	2016-04-08T04:07:52	I mean, I get it. If you can pull off the sleight of hand then do it. But sometimes being FLOTUS is part of career and sometimes off limits
grisuy	718288238683758592	2016-04-08T04:03:55	Either being a first lady is part of her expertise and can be judged accordingly or it isn't. Choose.

grisuy	718236874058371072	2016-04-08T00:39:49	This is a good, but depressing, thread. (h/t emilynussbaum). Worth scrolling down.  
grisuy	718184585989754882	2016-04-07T21:12:03	This thread is instructive and especially helpful for times when folks want "evidence" for claims of discrimination. 
grisuy	718241883357581313	2016-04-08T00:59:43	drisis for today I'm loving it. Tomorrow when I look all the stuff I didn't do today. Well, I'll worry about that tomorrow

grisuy	718200155170856961	2016-04-07T22:13:55	7B. Ending MassIncarceration is a state-by-state, county-by-county battle. Fighting crime is too. That‚Äôs where attention must be focused.
grisuy	718199835480821760	2016-04-07T22:12:38	6. If ppl, say, attacked the 1994 Act for funding police instead of public defenders, then maybe protests wld fix TODAY‚ÄôS issues.
grisuy	718199681524695041	2016-04-07T22:12:02	5. There are so many things that ACTUALLY MATTER that get no attention, while we rehash the culture wars of the 90s.
grisuy	718199614063513600	2016-04-07T22:11:46	4B. To the defenders: no change in federal law affects street crime that much, and the grants all underperformed.
grisuy	718199524230098944	2016-04-07T22:11:24	4A. To the critics: prison growth started SLOWING in 1993, and steadily SLOWED until it dropped in 2010. 
grisuy	718199331359219712	2016-04-07T22:10:38	3C. Impact of policing increases weak:  Impact of assault gun ban weak: 
grisuy	718199223942930432	2016-04-07T22:10:13	3B. Almost all new laws focused on fed crimes, which are few and far between. TIS grants didn‚Äôt change prison pops in any noticeable way.
grisuy	718195038778433537	2016-04-07T21:53:35	I found myself oddly captivated by that piece.

grisuy	718129045767065601	2016-04-07T17:31:21	This. Hillary said lots of stuff about Obama, and they fine.
