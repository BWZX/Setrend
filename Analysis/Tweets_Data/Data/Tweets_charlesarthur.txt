charlesarthur	723527108891410432	2016-04-22T15:01:19	jaykannan I could put a pic onto Instagram in 3 seconds from phone. Would take a lot longer to get to Flickr from PC.

charlesarthur	723525578289192960	2016-04-22T14:55:14	jaykannan it’s not emulating a PC. It’s being a place to write code. PCs don’t have a monopoly; I used to code on mainframes.
charlesarthur	723525417504747520	2016-04-22T14:54:36	jaykannan this is a trucks/cars argument; you’re trying to make everyone drive cars. Some only want bicycles to get down narrow streets.
charlesarthur	723525025513496576	2016-04-22T14:53:03	jaykannan I can code in Python on iPad if I want to. And then deploy to a server. No PC harmed in the process.
charlesarthur	723524283335585792	2016-04-22T14:50:06	jaykannan you’re sounding like a grumpy old man who thinks smartphones are a fad. Bad mode of thinking.
charlesarthur	723524186870788096	2016-04-22T14:49:43	jaykannan Instagram, Soundcloud, sharing apps - all smartphone-based, cultural exploration to heart’s content.
charlesarthur	723523537265430528	2016-04-22T14:47:08	jaykannan I’m not saying that. I’m saying few people will see need for a PC. Most people don’t need to program. Those who do, will.
charlesarthur	723523293513420800	2016-04-22T14:46:10	jaykannan TheOverspill stuff like this 
charlesarthur	723522825349402624	2016-04-22T14:44:18	jaykannan I’ve yet to see a company built without employees who wear clothes. Therefore, all companies should make clothes. Is your logic.
charlesarthur	723522640317657088	2016-04-22T14:43:34	jaykannan no, you don’t. China has ecosystems that are smartphone-app-only. Haven’t you been reading theoverspill?
charlesarthur	723522336067063808	2016-04-22T14:42:21	jaykannan your ideas of what “creation” is are too locked in the 19th century.
charlesarthur	723522247181389824	2016-04-22T14:42:00	jaykannan that simply isn’t true. I can map and photograph an area far better with a phone than ever could with a PC.
charlesarthur	723522006436720640	2016-04-22T14:41:03	jaykannan most people don’t need to write programs. We never had to program Instamatic cameras or video cameras.
charlesarthur	723521750466760704	2016-04-22T14:40:02	jaykannan Snapchat and Instagram are creation and consumption. Uber, Lyft, all those show power of mobile.
charlesarthur	723521320470908929	2016-04-22T14:38:19	jaykannan so Instagram and Snapchat are flops? And Uber is desktop-only? Value is created on smartphones. But you have to look.
charlesarthur	723519061511016449	2016-04-22T14:29:21	jaykannan India has comparatively low penetration of phones. Still a way to go in China. And Africa, for smartphones, big opportunity.
charlesarthur	723518076969472000	2016-04-22T14:25:26	jaykannan large tracts of developing world have zero PCs, but they won’t get one because they’ll get a smartphone.
charlesarthur	723517143120248832	2016-04-22T14:21:43	jaykannan well, Windows has a problem too if fewer PCs are sold. PC installed base is shrinking, according to IDC/Gartner.
charlesarthur	723516189713006592	2016-04-22T14:17:56	jaykannan higher-priced enterprise licences? I don’t know the detail, but have seen that PC sales correlate poorly with its OEM revenue.

charlesarthur	723513558474973184	2016-04-22T14:07:29	jaykannan the data says no - Intel layoffs and forecast points to further downturn. Win OEM revenue is tied more to PC prices.

charlesarthur	722790639180472320	2016-04-20T14:14:51	charlesarthur And the speakers aren’t generally pointed forward, which means the sound is indirect and more dependent on room acoustics

charlesarthur	705396919393247232	2016-03-03T14:18:25	nicoliver86 RickJWaghorn shonaghosh put it this way - Google has never run banner ads, and it knows why.
charlesarthur	705383224642564096	2016-03-03T13:24:00	shonaghosh ah, so we’re moving on to “bargaining” from denial and anger.

charlesarthur	705380228168851456	2016-03-03T13:12:06	nicoliver86 RickJWaghorn shonaghosh um. Rather than doing that, a 99p adblocker on phone and free one on desktop does it all.

charlesarthur	701777612239142912	2016-02-22T14:36:35	BlairReeves and now, make the person American, visiting Russia or China or Turkey or Libya or Egypt. Should Apple hack the phone?

charlesarthur	701776199761182721	2016-02-22T14:30:59	BlairReeves my question was about quality of encryption, not access. Apple gives LE access to what it stores, with warrant.

charlesarthur	701774969869623296	2016-02-22T14:26:05	BlairReeves so should every vendor of IT gear in the US be obliged to have slightly shaky encryption? SSL too? Banking?
charlesarthur	701774780928811009	2016-02-22T14:25:20	BlairReeves Apple’s fine with FBI searching the iOS that’s there. But not with being forced to write a new one to make a backdoor.
charlesarthur	701773450512359424	2016-02-22T14:20:03	BlairReeves have you not grasped yet? It’s not Apple’s phone. Apple isn’t obliged to help people search things it doesn’t own.
charlesarthur	701772628860780548	2016-02-22T14:16:47	BlairReeves getwired code is speech (previous Sup. Ct decision), forced speech is illegal under 1A (Barrette, Sup Ct), hence FBIos illegal

charlesarthur	697395083193249792	2016-02-10T12:21:59	rizwindu a halfway house to what? You can listen to digital downloads when you like, if you have playback equipment.

charlesarthur	697393661705846784	2016-02-10T12:16:20	alexhern fair point.

charlesarthur	697392481940406272	2016-02-10T12:11:39	chailey_ is streaming just too pricey compared to the number of CDs you buy?

charlesarthur	697392094336393218	2016-02-10T12:10:06	alexhern yeah, but the thing I realised is: who cares whether it’s a track I “bought” or an AM one? Both are the same.

charlesarthur	697044487223246849	2016-02-09T13:08:50	daunorubicin this is the point - people get repairs and the phones work fine. Then there’s a crypto chat w/ update server and :-(((
charlesarthur	697044203088515074	2016-02-09T13:07:43	daunorubicin the problem comes when it talks to the SW update server, which detects pairing broken, and stops boot before OS runs.
charlesarthur	697044075032264704	2016-02-09T13:07:12	daunorubicin the problem is that it doesn’t have a half-measure at the software update stage. Before that, TouchID just disabled.
charlesarthur	697041040470106112	2016-02-09T12:55:09	Ruth999 I think you’d be able to afford more than “good”. And you could keep it in bloody ermine.

charlesarthur	697036273077374976	2016-02-09T12:36:12	mikarv the hinge may be whether the software update server will be tweaked to allow phones that don’t have “paired” TouchID any more…
charlesarthur	697036091593981952	2016-02-09T12:35:29	mikarv well, I think there are probably some urgent discussions going on about this. But it’s the current security model.

charlesarthur	697015906640228352	2016-02-09T11:15:16	arebee sure, but it’s a separate app on mobile - as in, what iTunes on desktop does is multiple apps on mobile.

charlesarthur	697012516040392704	2016-02-09T11:01:48	arebee ok, but general point remains: you aren’t allowed untrammelled access to everything on the device. Ditto TPM etc.
charlesarthur	697011278460616704	2016-02-09T10:56:53	arebee black-box reverse engineering is protected, but not hacking into the system to copy the code and RE that.
charlesarthur	697010465965281280	2016-02-09T10:53:39	Stniuk 3rd party repairers have been telling me, and I’ve seen reports, that they have kept away from it for at least a year.
charlesarthur	697009982320074753	2016-02-09T10:51:44	arebee certain? Thought that was in the EULA.
charlesarthur	697009670494494720	2016-02-09T10:50:29	GristoMill so only time it can truly check serial is on accessing update server. But can’t do that *every* boot; server would collapse
charlesarthur	697009447919550464	2016-02-09T10:49:36	GristoMill as in, if the TouchID serial were burned into chip, then could never replace. But on boot, can’t know if value was changed.
charlesarthur	697009309394321408	2016-02-09T10:49:03	GristoMill indeed. This is the weakness in the process. A firmware value could be altered maliciously. But can’t burn in TouchID serial.

charlesarthur	696978369951440896	2016-02-09T08:46:07	SuB8u cmschroed we’re social animals - everything is relative in the pecking order.
charlesarthur	696978168222244864	2016-02-09T08:45:19	cyberdoyle hope not. We are considering a mesh network..
charlesarthur	696978064769728512	2016-02-09T08:44:54	enorris thanks. Yes, good point about the error code - though of course it never boots the OS so error codes is all it can do.
charlesarthur	696977907927932928	2016-02-09T08:44:17	nisummers do we know why? Rolled into something else, or just not viable?
charlesarthur	696977818350174208	2016-02-09T08:43:55	jonathandavey It can’t just disable specific functions given Apple Pay presence. Seems to be a requirement to prevent SE access.
