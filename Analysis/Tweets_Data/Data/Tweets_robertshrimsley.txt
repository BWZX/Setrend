robertshrimsley	726062765039845376	2016-04-29T14:57:07	brief_rants JohnRentoul when did I say he was a racist?
robertshrimsley	726062099810627584	2016-04-29T14:54:28	beatonthedonis stephenpollard i agree - that wasn't my point. antisemitism is a subset of racism. murder is a subset of lawbreaking
robertshrimsley	726061878519205888	2016-04-29T14:53:36	Coopswords Emmabarnett i answered this. you can absolutely criticise a govt without being racist, but you can also do it in a way that is
robertshrimsley	726000474042830850	2016-04-29T10:49:36	brief_rants JohnRentoul as you say in your bio you are an unquestioning Corbynite - questioning your idol does not compute for you
robertshrimsley	726000074917068805	2016-04-29T10:48:00	Coopswords Emmabarnett delighted you are not anti-jewish. but why do you dismiss all concern about antisemitism as being about israel

robertshrimsley	725998976546299904	2016-04-29T10:43:39	brief_rants JohnRentoul in lots of cases you are right. in this case it feels like a signalling device  - but perhaps you've tuned out

robertshrimsley	725800053290467329	2016-04-28T21:33:12	nomiackerman that was my view till this week. now i feel it is still a vote for labour and a win for corbyn.

robertshrimsley	725683711958749185	2016-04-28T13:50:54	SamMcIntosh my hunch is that they find it so hard to believe anyone could think them racist  they assume it is politically motivated attack

robertshrimsley	725677154747428864	2016-04-28T13:24:50	SamMcIntosh i sense we are not going to agree  but the difference for me is that these views were not excused by the leadership in the past

robertshrimsley	725421151292428288	2016-04-27T20:27:34	maggivaughan issue is that anger at israel - much of it justified - has caused people to lose sight of whether they cross the line

robertshrimsley	725378787072954368	2016-04-27T17:39:14	Extraordinary  that Naz Shah is actually emerging from this shambles with more dignity than Corbyn. Her draft apology was powerful
robertshrimsley	725374853403017216	2016-04-27T17:23:36	m2m_johnlewis this si gettign cricular. but if you are comfortable with racist jokes then you'll like this: 
robertshrimsley	725374231496773632	2016-04-27T17:21:08	m2m_johnlewis no he doesn't. article is headed anti-zionism is the new antisemitism. he says criticism is not antisemitic, not same thing
robertshrimsley	725370476516790277	2016-04-27T17:06:12	m2m_johnlewis she seems more appalled by her comments than you do. but if you're cool with racist jokes . .
robertshrimsley	725360755755851776	2016-04-27T16:27:35	m2m_johnlewis but Israel isn't elsewhere. Russia would not invade ukraine if it was elsewhere
robertshrimsley	725357550456156160	2016-04-27T16:14:51	m2m_johnlewis and am pretty sure Labour would (rightly) have instantly suspended any MP who made such a remark
robertshrimsley	725357374429614080	2016-04-27T16:14:09	m2m_johnlewis was she serious? dunno, was clearly flippant but not sure she'd put up with quips about transporting all muslims to pakistan
robertshrimsley	725356890646024196	2016-04-27T16:12:13	m2m_johnlewis why being anti the israeli govt justifies saying all jews should be transported from the land
robertshrimsley	725356631383486464	2016-04-27T16:11:12	m2m_johnlewis that means BDS need not be antisemitic. BUT a) too much anti-israel rhetoric slips into antisemitism (2) &amp; I would ask
robertshrimsley	725356409580302336	2016-04-27T16:10:19	m2m_johnlewis I'm not sure he says what you think. He says opposing israeli actions is not anti-semitic - I agree &amp; am very anti Bibi (1)

robertshrimsley	725355543469133824	2016-04-27T16:06:52	parkhurstchall of course it isn't, but last time I looked he had not called for any of them to be ethnically cleansed from a country (1)
robertshrimsley	725355091696488450	2016-04-27T16:05:04	parkhurstchall where your evidence in actions rather than words

robertshrimsley	725351369549471744	2016-04-27T15:50:17	m2m_johnlewis that's an arguable position, but calling for all jews to be transported is.
robertshrimsley	725351075973369856	2016-04-27T15:49:07	Not_Political I see why youuse a pseudonym. Being a racist dimwit isn't something you want your colleagues to know about you

robertshrimsley	725349111365509121	2016-04-27T15:41:19	derekrootboy you can support the palestinians without supporting ethnic cleansing of jews. If you don;t see that you are antisemitic
robertshrimsley	725347552669884416	2016-04-27T15:35:07	So Corbyn now looks weak as well as indifferent to antisemitism. Naz Shah may come through this a better person; Corbyn beyond hope
