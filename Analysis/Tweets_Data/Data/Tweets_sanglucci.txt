sanglucci	701069681151578112	2016-02-20T15:43:31	I've heard from countless women that they're biggest issue in relationships is they get bored easily. DatingApps make that shit even worse
sanglucci	701069523131224064	2016-02-20T15:42:54	I also seriously think boredom is a big issue among many couples and many failed relationships. Ppl get bored in a heartbeat now. Dating
sanglucci	701069330834964480	2016-02-20T15:42:08	Look at the profiles you have to create on these dating sites like wtf are you selling? Ppl foresake the concept of natural progression
sanglucci	701069154913222656	2016-02-20T15:41:26	Yas 
sanglucci	701069027783925761	2016-02-20T15:40:56	Is that not a relentless pursuit? After one has dated enough they know damn well they ain't finding perfection 
sanglucci	701068365964644353	2016-02-20T15:38:18	This is my school of thought. The problem I'm throwing out there is the trap that ppl get pulled into 
sanglucci	701067498251157506	2016-02-20T15:34:51	I mean dating apps are what you make of it but just like social media has changed us, dating apps do too
