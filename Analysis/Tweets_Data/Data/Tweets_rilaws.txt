rilaws	724132784479023104	2016-04-24T07:08:04	ShiggsyQ AGREED
rilaws	724131728734982147	2016-04-24T07:03:52	pricepeterson She's a genius, and incredibly talented, but she is not an activist as much as she's receptive of climate
rilaws	724131426120175616	2016-04-24T07:02:40	pricepeterson But there is no wild, brave artistry here
rilaws	724131232527835136	2016-04-24T07:01:54	pricepeterson It was a very controlled burst, tuned to the times, the way her whole career is. She's extremely calculating, which is fine
rilaws	724130548835319809	2016-04-24T06:59:11	pricepeterson Hard to link without linking to all of her interviews over her two-decade career. She was slow on it, though.
rilaws	724128544377454592	2016-04-24T06:51:13	pricepeterson That's a great Instagram but she was famously v slow to even acknowledge her gay fan base
rilaws	724127609479671808	2016-04-24T06:47:30	pricepeterson Right. Though I do question how her very controlled version of explicit actually translates to real-world explicitness
rilaws	724127141118545920	2016-04-24T06:45:38	pricepeterson I'm not at all qualified to speak about her race politics
rilaws	724126545363775489	2016-04-24T06:43:16	pricepeterson She's the most influential person in the world and her gay politics are remote and hidden behind allusion, at best
rilaws	724126212134703105	2016-04-24T06:41:57	pricepeterson I don't mean it to be condescending. I just mean that it's very easy to graft politics onto her celebrity that isn't there
rilaws	724124947380113409	2016-04-24T06:36:55	pricepeterson I was making fun of myself
rilaws	724124814202515456	2016-04-24T06:36:23	pricepeterson I wasn't snarking that. I was snarking that many of her gay white fans don't really know what that meaningful thing is
rilaws	724124032791093249	2016-04-24T06:33:17	pricepeterson to approach a celebrity that she so wholeheartedly embraces
rilaws	724123915233189888	2016-04-24T06:32:49	pricepeterson But her rather famous reticence to speak out on political issues, or really anything, seems like a very choosy way
rilaws	724123767950180352	2016-04-24T06:32:14	pricepeterson And I think we are hopefully seeing just the beginning of her social and political awakening
rilaws	724123628657364993	2016-04-24T06:31:41	pricepeterson She's definitely made more socially relevant comments than most stars of her caliber--so, more than Taylor Swift
rilaws	724122452247367680	2016-04-24T06:27:00	ShiggsyQ Unless she IS. And thus the sort of dodgy coyness of her whole thing
rilaws	724122243522027520	2016-04-24T06:26:11	ShiggsyQ I really don't get it among white young-ish gay men, who she is VERY MUCH not talking to
rilaws	724121673998471168	2016-04-24T06:23:55	pricepeterson They can and she wouldn't disagree with them. Whether she's been explicit about courting them or just relied on inference tho
rilaws	724120675426906116	2016-04-24T06:19:57	ShiggsyQ I think she is a kid raised in show biz who has an insane isolating life who is doing her best. It's the fan worship I question
rilaws	724120244516753408	2016-04-24T06:18:14	pricepeterson Fair! She is not an enemy. Whether she's an ally tho seems mercurial
rilaws	724118346367639552	2016-04-24T06:10:41	ShiggsyQ Which is fine! But champions of justice tend to be a hell of a lot louder and more persistent than she is
rilaws	724118095820939264	2016-04-24T06:09:42	ShiggsyQ Her identity is so controlled at this point that it's impossible to infer any point of view beyond the limited things she gives us
rilaws	724117703850602496	2016-04-24T06:08:08	ShiggsyQ I have zero qualification to be her critic.
rilaws	724116309450043393	2016-04-24T06:02:36	ShiggsyQ Hm...
rilaws	724115127600029696	2016-04-24T05:57:54	alexqsmith I think the term "sort of explicitly" needs some investigation

rilaws	703816745178566656	2016-02-28T05:39:22	Have had like a bunch of white cis gay men tonight tell me that Tangerine is problematic. As a white cis gay man, am I crazy or...?
rilaws	703816488742952960	2016-02-28T05:38:21	KennieTea It's funny. But it's also deeply human and ends on a note of beautiful, heartbreaking uncertainty
rilaws	703816019169689600	2016-02-28T05:36:29	KennieTea I value their opinion of the trans sex worker experience more than I value my faraway discernment of it
rilaws	703815880904458240	2016-02-28T05:35:56	KennieTea I also trust the actresses weren't exploited because they say they weren't and have stood by the movie for a year.
rilaws	703815703212728321	2016-02-28T05:35:14	KennieTea If you saw Tangerine as being played for yuks, I genuinely don't think you saw the same movie I did
rilaws	703813912291110913	2016-02-28T05:28:07	KennieTea So you're saying that Taylor and Rodriguez were exploited?
rilaws	703812379151351808	2016-02-28T05:22:02	KennieTea bradhunter I mean... You're grafting your values on the movie's values
rilaws	703809333805637632	2016-02-28T05:09:55	KennieTea bradhunter Sure, but, reality isn't always fun?

rilaws	703806168976789504	2016-02-28T04:57:21	bradhunter What did you want that convo to be? About how trans lawyers are more worth it than trans sex workers or...?
rilaws	703805127858192384	2016-02-28T04:53:13	bradhunter Got it. Well, ask the trans sex workers who star in the movie and have stood by it what they feel, or continue concern trolling!

rilaws	703803870196187136	2016-02-28T04:48:13	bradhunter So you're saying there's something wrong with sex work, and denying that many trans women of color find themselves in it?
rilaws	703802378177351680	2016-02-28T04:42:17	bradhunter Sorry, still trying to grapple with the point of this tweet. Should we not be happy for the movie bc you've heard from folks?
rilaws	703801898084790272	2016-02-28T04:40:23	bradhunter Sure! Don't doubt that there is that.

rilaws	703798761231925250	2016-02-28T04:27:55	So good to see Mya Taylor win a big award for Tangerine. Like there is literally nothing about that that isn't good, and hopeful, and right.
