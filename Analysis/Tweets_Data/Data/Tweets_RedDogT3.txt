RedDogT3	725757241446535168	2016-04-28T18:43:04	As far as stocks. None look ready to "break out".  So I remain tactical both long and short depending on the names.

RedDogT3	710850327742947335	2016-03-18T15:28:19	Thanks. nflx was tight and worth putting on your radar. Traders like tight patterns 
RedDogT3	710849932568227840	2016-03-18T15:26:45	uc1digger yes. $102.20 was some resistance. A close here or higher is good
RedDogT3	710846671165460480	2016-03-18T15:13:47	jasontoronto1 happens
RedDogT3	710840819025121280	2016-03-18T14:50:32	Anyone else think it's Kind of Cute. That Jamie can do a Huge insider buy jpm. Then a month later announce a huge share buyback.
RedDogT3	710839667537661952	2016-03-18T14:45:58	Probably a good spot to take profits in xme if your still long. See if a RDR develops around $21.14 pivot
RedDogT3	710839378717908992	2016-03-18T14:44:49	Thanks. It's day#2. U can trim some. And trail some

RedDogT3	710838115519303684	2016-03-18T14:39:48	amzn day 2 lower after its relative weakness yesterday.
RedDogT3	710837682952396802	2016-03-18T14:38:04	RDR in cat today around the $76.30 pivot -
RedDogT3	710831400027607040	2016-03-18T14:13:07	Cool. Glad you caught it. iwm gave another nice two day set up. From yesterday 
RedDogT3	710829657562746884	2016-03-18T14:06:11	Did he just say is it "really a rally" since there's been no volume. "There is no money back guarantee if U lost short in it"
RedDogT3	710827821745229824	2016-03-18T13:58:53	Lol  
RedDogT3	710827648096870400	2016-03-18T13:58:12	Sometimes when stocks hit targets. It can be a bit depressing. As you look back on how you could have handled it better. learnfromit
RedDogT3	710827379074179073	2016-03-18T13:57:08	Anyway. Markets tacking on another day of gains. Banks playing catch up. xle a little extended. High beta tech is mixed
RedDogT3	710827087884587009	2016-03-18T13:55:58	fcx also hit target here. It was the treasure for trash trade that can double. At target now.
RedDogT3	710826914324357121	2016-03-18T13:55:17	#1 stock from my 2016 report just hit the target. wynn. Probably a better sell here at $95. The buy price was in the $60's-$70's

RedDogT3	710801089533239296	2016-03-18T12:12:40	True. Better to tune out the noise at extremes as most try and sound smart or create headlines

RedDogT3	710557436059459586	2016-03-17T20:04:28	Sometimes better to use "letters" "rulers" &amp; "Crayons" vs. "smart money" 
RedDogT3	710545317964488709	2016-03-17T19:16:19	StockSurfer10 money keeps rotating. If iwm went first. Could be more trustable. Since it's going later. Small skeptisism

RedDogT3	710542598767812609	2016-03-17T19:05:31	iwm now looks ready for another move after resting for a week plus. Good plan from morning note when it cleared $107.33 long next $109

RedDogT3	710532242012049408	2016-03-17T18:24:22	Most thought the "trend day" after the fed would be down. Well u had time to adjust when spy went green or took out $203.85 -now $205++
RedDogT3	710530874232721408	2016-03-17T18:18:56	FYI- stock buybacks R in affect till March 29th.  Then about 75% of the companies start their black out period. Today is March 17th
RedDogT3	710530424242577408	2016-03-17T18:17:08	NorthmanTrader buybacks continue until March 29th.  Then back to black out period.
RedDogT3	710530061238140928	2016-03-17T18:15:42	Parag_ka nope. Tried to be too cute. But kept monthly flows into 529 and 403b. But her 401k was built with flows thru 2004-2014

RedDogT3	710527498103201792	2016-03-17T18:05:31	True. No need to be all in. You can also pick spots -but rolling up shorts until your right could hurt or blow u up 
RedDogT3	710525000713904128	2016-03-17T17:55:35	Kingpin_15 p.s. It was built from 2004 thru the financial crisis. But in 2014 she went into private practice. So no more contributions

RedDogT3	710523133191700480	2016-03-17T17:48:10	Yes. Above the 8/21 day U try &amp; be long/Not short. Below it, U try &amp; be risk off or tactical. better than opinions 
RedDogT3	710518937180618752	2016-03-17T17:31:30	One of these gets posted each morning. As you can see -$spy reclaimed the 8/21 day around $191. Been above since 
RedDogT3	710514716385398784	2016-03-17T17:14:43	True! Better to adjust around pivots depending on the days action vs heavy noise . spy at next resistance
RedDogT3	710514099210350592	2016-03-17T17:12:16	EsmailzadehRay not sure u can short here. But doesn't hurt to trim longs if your still in them
RedDogT3	692016124305641472	2016-01-26T16:07:55	Can we get 10,000 Retweets for a War Veteran 
RedDogT3	710489395950911488	2016-03-17T15:34:06	Yes - there are consolidation phases and then times for blast off. I show them here over three decades spx spy 
RedDogT3	710488454241652736	2016-03-17T15:30:22	Yes. An individual name game with pivots and quick feet. Rally broaden out a bit. To give additional legs  
RedDogT3	710480984769216513	2016-03-17T15:00:41	Yes. You have to be careful who you follow if you trade for a living.

RedDogT3	710472027258363905	2016-03-17T14:25:05	spy small range. Pivot low is $202.77. Some long verse that. Or short vs $203.48.

RedDogT3	708629218754740224	2016-03-12T12:22:26	I like to post these type of videos on the weekend. Verse charts &amp; tactics. A positive mind is necessary 4 execution 
RedDogT3	708628064536764417	2016-03-12T12:17:50	The best way to build confidence is through experience and success. Small steps lead to firmer ground. Then faster steps take place
RedDogT3	708627776329408512	2016-03-12T12:16:42	Face your fears -build confidence vs relying on meds. This is a good read. Not for everyone.  But can work

RedDogT3	708402880840130561	2016-03-11T21:23:02	frankie_belma yup
RedDogT3	708402312306417664	2016-03-11T21:20:47	Delta__Neutral no
RedDogT3	708402281079816193	2016-03-11T21:20:39	Mikemundojr something like that
RedDogT3	708402194031243264	2016-03-11T21:20:19	19mich24 nope. She is in a 3% guaranteed product as I couldn't do monthly flows. But 529 and 403b get monthly flows. Thanks 4 asking
RedDogT3	708401929169321985	2016-03-11T21:19:16	frankie_belma or. Just monthly flows into S&amp;P funds or etfs. U did just fine
RedDogT3	708401460363575296	2016-03-11T21:17:24	If U trade 4 alpha &amp; P&amp;L - most indices reclaimed the 8/21day around spx 1900 after a technical 2x bottom at 1812. &amp; been above since
RedDogT3	708400990232379392	2016-03-11T21:15:32	If you stayed the course. 401k 403b 529 plan with monthly inflows. U helped your average cost. Bulls have won the last 100 years. Good job
RedDogT3	708393694295105536	2016-03-11T20:46:32	Yes. Good to be long when sectors and stocks are above the 8day moving averages- Not short- besides a rental  
RedDogT3	708392370061111296	2016-03-11T20:41:16	Can anyone answer this?  I like to say "They are good"-- "market gods? Or just not us?  
RedDogT3	708391660179361794	2016-03-11T20:38:27	PatrickGrattan1 yup
RedDogT3	708391529224790017	2016-03-11T20:37:56	ILOVE181 good question
RedDogT3	708390342941392896	2016-03-11T20:33:13	Everyone says "this won't end well".  BTW that is an opinion!  So better to respect the action until the market tells you that
RedDogT3	708389864660721664	2016-03-11T20:31:19	At least you had about 60 minutes today to decide if you wanted to get long vs. opening gap. And cover shorts if u carried them. HOD now
RedDogT3	708389570543484928	2016-03-11T20:30:09	It's amazing how the market throws a Miss-directional day in like yesterday. To stop out longs and trap more short. "They" are good
RedDogT3	708351705814081543	2016-03-11T17:59:41	Rated PG13 
RedDogT3	708330508019757057	2016-03-11T16:35:27	Oscillators are  +55ish.  Last peak was +90.  Going to lay off looking for shorts until around Fed meeting. "If" we see spx 2040ish
RedDogT3	708329952261836801	2016-03-11T16:33:15	spy in the gap. We'll see how much it fills. It's open up till $203.80. I took long off here from opening strategy 
RedDogT3	708328268085198849	2016-03-11T16:26:33	I did. Try and buy spy vs 30 minute low then take out $201.35. And sell north $202. Small tactical cash flow  
RedDogT3	708327772700209152	2016-03-11T16:24:35	wolftrader67 maybe next week into the fed. We just sat here for a week. So be a bit careful
RedDogT3	708325935733465088	2016-03-11T16:17:17	I guess those 3 lower highs in tlt's starting at $135.25 2/11 then $133.39 then $130.99 meant something. Or at least gave spots to navigate

RedDogT3	708320806200279040	2016-03-11T15:56:54	Lots of deals back then into that crazy news cycle - Spain -Italy etc all gave big yields. Not so now  
RedDogT3	708318542307958784	2016-03-11T15:47:55	Yes. This was the plan. If $201ish Holds we can get the push towards $202+ where 200day lives  
RedDogT3	708318209351544832	2016-03-11T15:46:35	If you came in flat. At least they gave U something 2 do- example. If u bought $201.30 vs. gap pivot u make a little 
RedDogT3	708309700111159296	2016-03-11T15:12:46	I'm not too motivated to do "too much". Been a good week
RedDogT3	708309524860571649	2016-03-11T15:12:05	spy range set. $201.12 is pivot/gap support. Morning high $201.67
RedDogT3	708309390621855745	2016-03-11T15:11:33	Now you have some 30 minute ranges intact to trade against. If you came in flat. You can short vs the high. Or buy vs the low for cash flow
RedDogT3	708297432472403968	2016-03-11T14:24:02	Trump taking steps to build a Great team.  He actually sounds good today. When not provoked

RedDogT3	708281916219379712	2016-03-11T13:22:22	I'd say 85% of the mkt guys yesterday said market is cooked. Get short &amp; stay short.  So lots trapped. spx 2009 won't be as easy to reject
RedDogT3	708267591995932672	2016-03-11T12:25:27	A visual of spy chart I posted on yesterday's close. Watch $201.35. If it holds this time you have 200day &amp; old gap 
RedDogT3	708265257840603136	2016-03-11T12:16:11	First time I'm not upset being flat &amp; missing spx + 20 handles as I honored stops &amp; covered shorts yesterday .
RedDogT3	708264767140569090	2016-03-11T12:14:14	CrankyRicky no. Probably sustained this time

RedDogT3	708262215745478656	2016-03-11T12:04:05	spx +20 after a roller coaster day. Resistance at 2009 (big pivot) then 2024. (Flexibility is key)

RedDogT3	707953274830331905	2016-03-10T15:36:28	Now see if sellers can keep below $199.80 for additional pressure.  8day is now $199.40 then $198.20
RedDogT3	707952745068830720	2016-03-10T15:34:22	spy rejected at $201 area and now fading as A/D lines get worse. Take some care.

RedDogT3	707925260918632451	2016-03-10T13:45:09	A few thoughts! Does spy hold $201 &amp; push toward 200day at $202.21 then gap fill $203.87.  Or do we fail at $201 &amp; create a topping tail
RedDogT3	707924086031122432	2016-03-10T13:40:29	But- if you didn't buy the 3-4 day consolidation as the 8day held at 1977.  It's a tough spot chasing here at 2008ish.

RedDogT3	705499216718725120	2016-03-03T21:04:55	U can't just put on a trade because someone like Citron said it was going down. tsla. $189 was pivot cover-from note.

RedDogT3	705483715615522816	2016-03-03T20:03:19	If U tactically look daily at a chart like this. Using technicals &amp; a process. It can help keep u safe &amp; profitable 
RedDogT3	705479146630225920	2016-03-03T19:45:10	Better to ride a rally when it's above the 8/21 day vs just talk about shorting it. Or bashing it. Signals will tell us when it changes
RedDogT3	705478884121309184	2016-03-03T19:44:07	Now see if spy's stay above $199.06 (yesterday's high). Use pivots for adjustments.
RedDogT3	705478700289159168	2016-03-03T19:43:23	Always have stops and know what u can handle. Some thought spy would never get thru $189.50, $194.60, $197.40 - now it's $199++

RedDogT3	704387147370008576	2016-02-29T19:25:57	3 more questions! Is spx 1810 the low of the year? (probably not) Can Oil hold $30ish  Why do BIO's &amp; banks act so poorly?
RedDogT3	704385976848752640	2016-02-29T19:21:18	These are some questions traders are asking themselves?  Was spx 1963 the pivot high? Or do we see 1980-2020?  Can 50day be support now?
RedDogT3	704385572232687616	2016-02-29T19:19:41	If it can even get up there. A break &amp; close below spx 50day in the next session or so will bring back pressure  
RedDogT3	704365357440622592	2016-02-29T17:59:22	KymLang actually heard he is. I like him

RedDogT3	704363338692739073	2016-02-29T17:51:21	The tactical Bulls made a stand to hold above the 50day at spx 1944 today.  But structural Bears are visible at 1980-2020 above (big if)
RedDogT3	704362843831930880	2016-02-29T17:49:23	Hard to argue. Lots of unsettling headlines around the World. Need to know your timeframe &amp; have a process 2 execute 
RedDogT3	704359612082999296	2016-02-29T17:36:32	Muhammad Ali &amp; Sylvester Stallone - YouTube- this is funny. Never saw this  
RedDogT3	704343921078509568	2016-02-29T16:34:11	iwm approaching the 50day tactical target from last Thursday's post 
RedDogT3	704343623651991552	2016-02-29T16:33:00	.jfahmy yes. The tactical bull since the spx 2x bottom 1812 lows. Is getting closer to the intermediate structural bear claws.
RedDogT3	704342752826363905	2016-02-29T16:29:32	True.  Could be end of the month window dressing. But also not worth fighting  
RedDogT3	704341889651249153	2016-02-29T16:26:07	stox_trader perhaps in time
RedDogT3	704341583622180868	2016-02-29T16:24:54	Slow grinder. spx held 50day - oil kept a bid.  aapl strong for itself. High beta green. Decent stand buy Bulls. With oscillator+75

RedDogT3	703323604188934144	2016-02-26T20:59:49	Flat meaning.  I've been short a few time this week and long. At this time.  I'm not sure.  So cash is a position.
RedDogT3	703323168962797568	2016-02-26T20:58:05	My 1st time flat all week. No real edge here. Still overbought.  But not into "Major resistance".   So I will take this great week &amp; book it

RedDogT3	703248659899621377	2016-02-26T16:02:00	ricflairwcw true. Depends when they flip the switch.  Etc
RedDogT3	703248254566342656	2016-02-26T16:00:24	spy has room towards $198 to be "lightly careful long".  Then $198-$202ish to scale in short. Depends on speed &amp; how quick it happens
RedDogT3	703247949401346048	2016-02-26T15:59:11	Anyway. This market spot not that compelling. Better set up was Wednesday's reversal. Or reclaiming 50day yesterday- today is scraps.

RedDogT3	702594374555852802	2016-02-24T20:42:07	soup12171958 okay. We'll see if some can stay solvent and wait
RedDogT3	702593865870606336	2016-02-24T20:40:05	Fully agree. Demark going viral helped add fuel for that with Ralph 
RedDogT3	702593638585528320	2016-02-24T20:39:11	Exactly what we went over in the morning call video today  
RedDogT3	702591504318074882	2016-02-24T20:30:42	If you bought the spy at the $190.45 RDR pivot. Selling some here almost $3 higher. A nice cash flow trade
RedDogT3	702575359703846912	2016-02-24T19:26:33	I'm glad you learned it and profit from it.  It's calculated and risk is defined without opinions.  
RedDogT3	702575203214352384	2016-02-24T19:25:56	U could have used Friday's pivot low as UR major pivot today. It broke below them-then reclaimed them across the board for a good RDR trade
RedDogT3	702573310266179584	2016-02-24T19:18:25	I don't think you "add" here. But lots of nice RDR long trades around last Friday's pivot lows. Like spy reclaiming $190.45.
RedDogT3	702552894533472256	2016-02-24T17:57:17	Very funny. Happy Birthday Josh. Your a real guy who knows his stuff. Sorry I couldn't meet you guys last night  
RedDogT3	702540519117864960	2016-02-24T17:08:06	spx as of now held the .38% fib retracement around 1890 at first time. Brian's posts are good for prep 
RedDogT3	702539854182281216	2016-02-24T17:05:28	At least at this point. We have new information. spx held 1890  &amp; had a heart beat. Vs. streaky downside move like we saw on the way up
RedDogT3	702537059278458882	2016-02-24T16:54:22	spy chart like this is posted each morning. That support was better to cover vs press.  Some flipped long 
RedDogT3	702536639021580288	2016-02-24T16:52:41	Oil did wake back up. xle Almost green. Some pivots reclaimed. bulls putting in a small fight into month end
RedDogT3	702529055392923648	2016-02-24T16:22:33	JLoesser maybe
RedDogT3	702528750139940864	2016-02-24T16:21:21	Believe it or not. Oscillator that was almost +80. Highest level in a decade, hit 44 yesterday and still +10 now
RedDogT3	702527885257494528	2016-02-24T16:17:54	Oil spike faded. So did most names. Still heavy
RedDogT3	702514980743086081	2016-02-24T15:26:38	twtr got its first upgrade yesterday. Right at a short term too. Analysts are great
RedDogT3	702514709384171520	2016-02-24T15:25:33	DH_12 could be. $187.63 is a level before
RedDogT3	702512056881319936	2016-02-24T15:15:01	fb broke its bear flag ascending channel below $103.80. See if it stays below. amzn did the same below $541. Strategy from videos
RedDogT3	702511780208254981	2016-02-24T15:13:55	Cool. I'm glad your making money  
RedDogT3	702510311954198529	2016-02-24T15:08:05	You have your spy 30 minute range. Pivot support to trade against $189.43.  Gap resistance is $190.65. 10:30 oil number important
RedDogT3	702508787026960384	2016-02-24T15:02:01	Yes. They gave clues of yesterday's weakness and no strength there today .
RedDogT3	702507403766571008	2016-02-24T14:56:31	Levels need to be reclaimed fast -otherwise stay out of the way.
RedDogT3	702507271662780416	2016-02-24T14:56:00	So far no bounce. Most upper commitment levels breached. Covered spy short from recap. No clues yet to be long. But wouldn't press here

RedDogT3	702436859444645888	2016-02-24T10:16:12	oil, Jpm, and aapl all gave some leading clues of weakness yesterday so they should be watched today.  (Just to name a few)
RedDogT3	702436437174722560	2016-02-24T10:14:31	spy triggered a sell signal under $193.79 off .6% below yesterday's low $192.18 (see if it stays below). $190.50 pretty important support
RedDogT3	702435704278798336	2016-02-24T10:11:37	spx futures off 8 handles giving some nice downside follow through to yesterday's weakness. 1906ish is next support, then 1895
RedDogT3	702435309502504962	2016-02-24T10:10:03	Good morning. Mostly red arrows around the World. Europe  broadly lower, DAX-1.9% CAC-1.6%. Asia mixed, Nikkei off .9% HK-1.1% -$spx futs-8
RedDogT3	702305774152724480	2016-02-24T01:35:19	Tomorrow is somewhat important. You don't want to see break outs above a descending channel get rejected so fast

RedDogT3	702209490951626754	2016-02-23T19:12:43	spy's fill some of the gap below $193.79- lets see if it stays below "but" holds higher this week- levels 
RedDogT3	702185227804868608	2016-02-23T17:36:18	jp_boileau sure. They've been acting well
RedDogT3	702172602421407744	2016-02-23T16:46:08	Good spy look today. Early chance 2 short the $193.79 pivot. Then contained at the 8day on the 5 min. Each bounce  
RedDogT3	702164917902667778	2016-02-23T16:15:36	Oscillator that was +75 yesterday. Now at +43.  Still overbought. 8/21day spy support is $190.77-$191.33
RedDogT3	702164594421182464	2016-02-23T16:14:19	Back to flat spy (covered remainder)-193.79 was pivot 2 short.  There is still room 2 fill gap towards $192. Even $191.50ish. Will re-visit
RedDogT3	702164069214658560	2016-02-23T16:12:14	JGN74 got one. That would take it thru the gap fill and more
RedDogT3	702163745024270336	2016-02-23T16:10:57	GraduateInvestr nice. I'm glad you did
RedDogT3	702158901991620608	2016-02-23T15:51:42	Covered 2/3rds spy. Decent cash flow tactic into the gap below $193.79. To see it probe the gap
RedDogT3	702158629072478209	2016-02-23T15:50:37	jpm engulfed the 5day range after getting rejected at $59!  Staying by below $57.20 keeps pressure in the banks
RedDogT3	702158453125599232	2016-02-23T15:49:55	aapl broke below its inside range lower - below $95.80. If it stays below this. More downside
RedDogT3	702150371892928512	2016-02-23T15:17:48	Most sectors broke into yesterday's gaps and filling a portion. spy below $193.79- gap is open to $192.18.  Not sure how much it fills

RedDogT3	702086590336786432	2016-02-23T11:04:21	Good to review these  
RedDogT3	702086322652061696	2016-02-23T11:03:18	kenr0966 saw the same thing leading up to 2007-2008
RedDogT3	702086128178958336	2016-02-23T11:02:31	Yes I did. Not smart to add fuel and more irresponsible behavior by them  
RedDogT3	702075283839578112	2016-02-23T10:19:26	We'll see if today turns out to be a controlled gap fill/recover like Friday, or a bit weaker with Oil &amp; less constructive components
RedDogT3	702074871271071745	2016-02-23T10:17:47	Started hearing about house flipping commercials on 10-10 wins. That's not a good sign. "Heard of condo flipping in Florida in 2008"
RedDogT3	702074495058710528	2016-02-23T10:16:18	spy's off .6% in yesterday's gap below $193.79- see if it stays below or reclaims pivot, as there is an empty hole towards $192.
RedDogT3	702074032091484160	2016-02-23T10:14:27	spx futures off 12 after stalling at 1947ish. See if 1922-1926 can hold to keep some commitment. Then 1907
RedDogT3	702073513864249344	2016-02-23T10:12:24	Good morning. Mostly small red arrows around the World. In Asia Nikkei off .3% Shanghai-.79% in Europe DAX-.9% spx futures off 12
RedDogT3	701942766482358272	2016-02-23T01:32:51	I think spx tagged the same 1946 pivot or tagged lay January. We'll see how we hold next day or so -or not

RedDogT3	698167887756926977	2016-02-12T15:32:50	First gap that has held in awhile. In the spy - some long vs $183.96 for the day
RedDogT3	698167581786697728	2016-02-12T15:31:37	Oil, banks, some tech holding up. But big travel ranges from yesterday's lows. Makes buying strength. Not that compelling
RedDogT3	698167325359501313	2016-02-12T15:30:36	After 60 minutes.  You have some ranges to trade against. First spy move was a fade off $$185.15. Days low is $183.96. (It's slow)
RedDogT3	698167106295226368	2016-02-12T15:29:44	Harishot so far. First gap holding. Some strength in banks oil and tech. Could see spy $186today

RedDogT3	698165663664316417	2016-02-12T15:24:00	ricflairwcw yes.  Covered aapl. Still looks heavy though
RedDogT3	698140813856022528	2016-02-12T13:45:15	Two more? 1) Can today's gap up hold and build vs sold like most other times this year. 2) Can sellers contain rally 2 create a lower high
RedDogT3	698140246068891648	2016-02-12T13:43:00	Things 2 think about  1)Was that a successful test of spx 1812? 2)Is tech's positive divergence 4 real?  3) Can Oil &amp; banks hold today?
RedDogT3	698136724107608065	2016-02-12T13:29:00	Harishot funny. I was called a Perma bull when the trend was up from spx 1300 to north of 2000ish

RedDogT3	697883565606961157	2016-02-11T20:43:02	For today there were 3 plans. spy  1) hold above $181.02 2) push below and stay below  3) push below and reclaim   Crazy the way it works.
RedDogT3	697882804231802882	2016-02-11T20:40:01	Whether news is real or not. Markets ignited at the spx 1812 level. Tech that was strong all day lead the move. Some adjustment areas.

RedDogT3	697825838914469888	2016-02-11T16:53:39	ricflairwcw I'll see how it acts. A break and hard close below $92 will bring it to the Mid $80's and bring the Spx 1770 (if it happens)
RedDogT3	697822669425766402	2016-02-11T16:41:03	TraderSam1 a Close below $92 and u will get $85ish

RedDogT3	697801965582098432	2016-02-11T15:18:47	In order to get lows broken. You needed tech weaker. Or need to to "weaken". Otherwise be specific. Like amzn was nice red to green +++

RedDogT3	697130523597152260	2016-02-09T18:50:43	True. Losses happen. Bigger losses happen without a process and possibly end careers

RedDogT3	696533144988741633	2016-02-08T03:16:57	The only thing obvious now, is that Denver Defense won them the game.  Peyton is a class act. But he's finished. Great job Broncos

RedDogT3	690277466586374146	2016-01-21T20:59:07	PatrickWalker56 me too
RedDogT3	690275369996390402	2016-01-21T20:50:47	Market has a lot to prove before you pay up besides buying in the hole. Nice two way action with big ranges until then
RedDogT3	690274861264990208	2016-01-21T20:48:46	Big travel range that burned off the oscillator from -100. Now -43.  From spy $181 to $188.87.  Not much edge here
RedDogT3	690274416656195584	2016-01-21T20:47:00	Last night I went out long and the morning pre-morning call was buyable. For a nice rally. I will be flat overnight
RedDogT3	690237906179457028	2016-01-21T18:21:55	If you wait to sell your stocks when we enter a "Bear Market." U already lost big money. What about selling when it breaks the 8/21/50 day

RedDogT3	690209763364306944	2016-01-21T16:30:05	spy pushed up above yesterday's highs of $187.49 and hit $188.02 and back below. Some used that as a RDR to sell longs or cute short

RedDogT3	688898799134240768	2016-01-18T01:40:47	Not the best idea to focus on futures and markets tonight. A lot can and will change by Tuesday's open - take the time off

RedDogT3	688895482081443840	2016-01-18T01:27:36	Nice job Broncos. I'm glad they didn't lose putting Peyton Back in. A lose wouldn't have been great for his legacy in playoffs
