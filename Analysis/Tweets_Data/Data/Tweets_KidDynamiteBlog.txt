KidDynamiteBlog	717125500871786496	2016-04-04T23:03:37	ArtIntellignce thus far their best business model has been the company paying to pump it's own stock.which is, well, embarrassing. shameful
KidDynamiteBlog	717125391589240832	2016-04-04T23:03:11	ArtIntellignce but it's unlikely that it will be from the company creating value for equity holders.  (cont)

KidDynamiteBlog	717118794330730496	2016-04-04T22:36:58	ArtIntellignce so now they're trying to UNWIND their business model by selling patents in a patent-death-knoll environment (cont)

KidDynamiteBlog	717118543809130496	2016-04-04T22:35:58	ArtIntellignce seriously: you have a company that raised funds to buy patents during a heyday in that industry. (cont)
KidDynamiteBlog	717118430802001920	2016-04-04T22:35:31	ArtIntellignce but if you look at the possibility of them ever creating real value for their equity holders? oy vey.
KidDynamiteBlog	717118314519130112	2016-04-04T22:35:04	ArtIntellignce because it's a terrible investment... if your goal is to sell it to some sucker higher, good luck. that may happen. (cont)

KidDynamiteBlog	717110373359489025	2016-04-04T22:03:30	ArtIntellignce yes. i am well aware.
KidDynamiteBlog	717110135819255808	2016-04-04T22:02:34	ArtIntellignce because with the new death spiral, that's all that matters.

KidDynamiteBlog	717109989496762368	2016-04-04T22:01:59	ArtIntellignce and then there are payments owed to the companies they bought patents from. and more to Fortress... and the Convert...

KidDynamiteBlog	717106540667408384	2016-04-04T21:48:17	ArtIntellignce so when a motivated sellers sells their only asset... what do you think is left?  ah yes: JB's "Double Down" strategy.. lol

KidDynamiteBlog	717106017478246400	2016-04-04T21:46:12	ArtIntellignce here's the part of the 10k you should be most concerned with:

KidDynamiteBlog	717105223425204224	2016-04-04T21:43:03	ArtIntellignce you realize he's had this "plan" to monetize patents for 3 years, right?
KidDynamiteBlog	717103047718146048	2016-04-04T21:34:24	ArtIntellignce make sure you read the part in the 10k about their current liquidity...
KidDynamiteBlog	717102432220815364	2016-04-04T21:31:57	ArtIntellignce u seem confused... it's the  hopeful sale of assets that will be more than 2015 revenue.  IF it happens.

KidDynamiteBlog	696713212138561536	2016-02-08T15:12:28	one possible answer to all of these SRPT FDA questions is that the FDA is just another inept/undermanned gov't organization. K.I.S.S.

KidDynamiteBlog	696711708870635520	2016-02-08T15:06:30	cool_eran my point is that if FDA threw out 3 year data (which they did), 4 yr, 5 yr, 6 yr - still not "rigorous" under FDA BD language
KidDynamiteBlog	696711498970832896	2016-02-08T15:05:40	foswi hmmm. true... so that would be a bullish readthrough for today's pr...

KidDynamiteBlog	690635949362012161	2016-01-22T20:43:36	matthewherper i mean, you're a reporter: doesn't that part of the story interest you?  did SRPT mis-state their FDA interactions? (cont)
KidDynamiteBlog	690635505269088256	2016-01-22T20:41:50	matthewherper possible, but then we get back to: why did Farkas ever accept the NDA?  just doesn't make sense...
KidDynamiteBlog	690634845647667200	2016-01-22T20:39:13	matthewherper so then we're back to the beginning - all the interaction SRPT was supposedly getting from the FDA was moot... "worthless"
