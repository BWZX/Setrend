kimmaicutler	706311051776626688	2016-03-06T02:50:52	jayzalowitz Kazanjy eean if anything, family housing here is being eroded.
kimmaicutler	706310989893881856	2016-03-06T02:50:37	jayzalowitz Kazanjy eean In suburbs, I would agree with you. But in SF, I believe the tendency is for devs to go with studios, 1 BRs.

kimmaicutler	706310186017779716	2016-03-06T02:47:25	jayzalowitz Kazanjy eean I think that's what makes these developments somewhat politically unpalatable. People are afraid of the erosion
kimmaicutler	706309695946928128	2016-03-06T02:45:28	jayzalowitz Kazanjy eean I don't think women would live in that. You'd have all dudes.
kimmaicutler	706309534290055169	2016-03-06T02:44:50	jayzalowitz Kazanjy eean landlords are clearly profitably putting 2-3 bunkbeds in rooms and calling that "co-living"
kimmaicutler	706309461812482048	2016-03-06T02:44:32	jayzalowitz Kazanjy eean depends on what level of profit and what standard of quality.

kimmaicutler	706308619587887105	2016-03-06T02:41:12	jayzalowitz Kazanjy eean versus something that is self-organized, and has lower-quality specs.
kimmaicutler	706308518366695424	2016-03-06T02:40:48	jayzalowitz Kazanjy eean it's different when a company puts in a lot of remodeling costs, expenses into the building.

kimmaicutler	699815988422975488	2016-02-17T04:41:48	mychaelmartinez not exactly. Expectations of lower capital gains or property taxes will merely get capitalized into higher property values.

kimmaicutler	692884242125094913	2016-01-29T01:37:31	larissaarcher murphmonkey and then rebuild stuff at $600K-900K unit.... just for a few more units...?
kimmaicutler	692883884808077314	2016-01-29T01:36:05	larissaarcher murphmonkey I doubt it would financially pencil for a someone to demolish a bunch of market-rate units

kimmaicutler	692880885620695040	2016-01-29T01:24:10	larissaarcher murphmonkey But this is the American system, so you have to cast a wide net, for some 0.00001% of parcels to turn over.
kimmaicutler	692880811276705794	2016-01-29T01:23:53	larissaarcher murphmonkey if this was a city like Amsterdam or HK or whatever that publicly owned land, might be different.
kimmaicutler	692880723955429376	2016-01-29T01:23:32	larissaarcher murphmonkey no, that's just the estimate of which private land owners might decide to sell for re-development.

kimmaicutler	692879173367390208	2016-01-29T01:17:22	larissaarcher murphmonkey it's also a state law, so developers could circumvent the process demand density anyway which is what a

kimmaicutler	692777383187714049	2016-01-28T18:32:53	larissaarcher maybe. Or every crisis is an opportunity. I actually don't think it's bad enough yet.

kimmaicutler	692777051372146688	2016-01-28T18:31:34	larissaarcher but in practice I usually see it used by people who want to justify tech moving into other cities that are poorer or even

kimmaicutler	692776373224484864	2016-01-28T18:28:53	larissaarcher bc they don't have transit infrastructure. Also Prop 13 totally straight jackets municipal revenue such that multi family
kimmaicutler	692776257390379009	2016-01-28T18:28:25	larissaarcher that's not true. If you look into suburban city financing, structure, they're actually less well positioned to handle growth
kimmaicutler	692776091912540160	2016-01-28T18:27:46	larissaarcher and then you're like, oh. It's actually really complicated there too.
kimmaicutler	692776010010374144	2016-01-28T18:27:26	larissaarcher and then you go and look into what growth would mean for EPA or Oakland or wherever

kimmaicutler	692774539814567936	2016-01-28T18:21:36	larissaarcher in that an incoming population would create displacement pressure for not just tenants, but property owners as well.
kimmaicutler	692774400261664768	2016-01-28T18:21:02	larissaarcher It's difficult for every city everywhere to handle growth. Detroit has a totally different property tax structure

kimmaicutler	692696621688074240	2016-01-28T13:11:58	andrewmutz pmarca I think at the very least it has to be paired with some form of LVT so it does not merely just push up rents.

kimmaicutler	692208446385561600	2016-01-27T04:52:08	RFrances2 like a Berlinificiation of the Bay Area, rather than a Manhattanization, would be cool.
kimmaicutler	692208339409833984	2016-01-27T04:51:43	RFrances2 or CA didn't have to choose such terrible land-use, taxation policies
kimmaicutler	692202856368185346	2016-01-27T04:29:56	RFrances2 Ok but how do you magically finance this given land, labor costs?
kimmaicutler	692202404331266048	2016-01-27T04:28:08	RFrances2 underinvest in public transit, then blame privileged younger workers for pricing out service workers.
kimmaicutler	692202098105126913	2016-01-27T04:26:55	RFrances2 refuse to build anything at population growth, ride property value $$ gains while capping taxes.
kimmaicutler	692201979607715840	2016-01-27T04:26:27	RFrances2 cut property taxes, decimate the K-12 and higher educational system in CA. Make students graduate w unprecedented debt
kimmaicutler	692201865149288453	2016-01-27T04:25:59	RFrances2 like I said, generational theft.
kimmaicutler	692200520895873024	2016-01-27T04:20:39	RFrances2 "built out" is subjective. Built out w environmentally inefficient sprawl is diff than doing coastal infill w decent transit

kimmaicutler	692200224979341314	2016-01-27T04:19:28	RFrances2 those retirees and richer folk are just bidding up existing SF homes to astronomical prices while ppl get mad abt so-called

kimmaicutler	692199370331144194	2016-01-27T04:16:04	RFrances2 there hasn't been for about 2 decades
kimmaicutler	692199318464413696	2016-01-27T04:15:52	RFrances2 there is not really land in the Bay Area left for SF homes.
kimmaicutler	692198307607744512	2016-01-27T04:11:51	RFrances2 bc were not doing multi family infill in the Bay Area? All those are SF tracts.
kimmaicutler	692197235182931968	2016-01-27T04:07:35	RFrances2 but it makes residential development revenue negative for many CA cities
kimmaicutler	692195733341106176	2016-01-27T04:01:37	RFrances2 there won't be a future CA middle class to speak of
kimmaicutler	692195683156230144	2016-01-27T04:01:25	RFrances2 the whole region needs to build. And if it doesn't, then it's just one giant generational wealth transfer to babyboomers
kimmaicutler	692195560355450880	2016-01-27T04:00:56	RFrances2 that's just an excuse. World is urbanizing. Paris is &gt;2X as dense and it's gorgeous.
kimmaicutler	692193129508773889	2016-01-27T03:51:17	RFrances2 then bc property owners are insulated from housing shortages through capped taxes, they do nothing, aggravating the situation
kimmaicutler	692193000324227072	2016-01-27T03:50:46	RFrances2 Prop 13 savings just got priced into higher property values, which penalizes future Californians, future middle class.
kimmaicutler	692192799001874433	2016-01-27T03:49:58	RFrances2 there won't be a California middle class for much longer. It's been hemorrhagic away in pt bc of housing costs.
kimmaicutler	692192660052905987	2016-01-27T03:49:25	RFrances2 if you tax rents, won't landlords just raise taxes to cover those and wouldn't that also jeopardize rent control?
kimmaicutler	692190815590957058	2016-01-27T03:42:05	RFrances2 I'm arguing more of that 4X gain should go back to the city &amp; public. 
kimmaicutler	692190517333991424	2016-01-27T03:40:54	RFrances2 low property taxes get capitalized into higher property values.
kimmaicutler	692190403886456832	2016-01-27T03:40:27	RFrances2 new residents subsidizing lots of older residents through property taxes. Cities attempt to make up for it w/ fees, etc.
kimmaicutler	692190274357968898	2016-01-27T03:39:56	RFrances2 bc of Prop. 13, longstanding property owners taxes do not keep up with costs of providing public services.
kimmaicutler	692188777981296641	2016-01-27T03:33:59	RFrances2 SF property owners ROI is still much higher given last 5 years in appreciation, assuming 20% down.
kimmaicutler	692187656659300352	2016-01-27T03:29:32	RFrances2 that contributes to the lack of affordability
kimmaicutler	692187598572425220	2016-01-27T03:29:18	RFrances2 I'm saying our tax and political treatment of both are very different even though it's the same behavior
kimmaicutler	692187380598607873	2016-01-27T03:28:26	berkowitz_josh so does the developer.
kimmaicutler	692186395084001280	2016-01-27T03:24:31	berkowitz_josh and the land owner doesn't necessarily *do* anything.
kimmaicutler	692186221385224193	2016-01-27T03:23:50	berkowitz_josh you forgot the cost of land.
kimmaicutler	692185764524851200	2016-01-27T03:22:01	RFrances2 why do you selectively extract from the profits of one and not the other, esp when it's so insufficient for the situation?
kimmaicutler	692185531103494145	2016-01-27T03:21:05	RFrances2 how is that different from a home buyer, who puts down $20, borrows $80, sits on land, then sells for $200?
kimmaicutler	692184455994302466	2016-01-27T03:16:49	FezQamar BenedictEvans technically, so do property owners by using a smaller cash down payment &amp; borrowing the rest.
kimmaicutler	692181339324432384	2016-01-27T03:04:26	RFrances2 antagonizing developers lets all other property owners avoid their own complicity in aggravating the situation.
kimmaicutler	692181130401947648	2016-01-27T03:03:36	RFrances2 I don't understand why we selectively villainize &lt;1% of parcels per year, when everyone else is riding equity gains.
kimmaicutler	692181020251197443	2016-01-27T03:03:09	RFrances2 AaronPeskin even if you tightened that by &gt;100% or doubled it, it's a joke relative to the need.

kimmaicutler	689717568056102913	2016-01-20T07:54:17	Noahpinion most of the income spectrum.
kimmaicutler	689717549886345216	2016-01-20T07:54:12	Noahpinion or maybe the homeownership rate will stabilize, although I have a hard time seeing that happen w property pries relative to
kimmaicutler	689717488511115264	2016-01-20T07:53:58	Noahpinion and then implement political changes.
kimmaicutler	689717460925153282	2016-01-20T07:53:51	Noahpinion I think the only option is seeing things becomes unbearably awful in CA, wait for the homeownership rate to tip in 15 years
kimmaicutler	689717229038927872	2016-01-20T07:52:56	Noahpinion right. But they're older and they don't get it. And they don't have to get it bc their housing is secure.
kimmaicutler	689717080212410368	2016-01-20T07:52:20	Noahpinion and now we don't have affordable housing for the next generation of workers.
kimmaicutler	689717042325299200	2016-01-20T07:52:11	Noahpinion and then post 1970s, the only way to keep it going was supply restrictions and credit.
kimmaicutler	689716990869540864	2016-01-20T07:51:59	Noahpinion we chose this path w/ housing after WWII, let it run pretty successfully for a generation and had the incomes to support it.
kimmaicutler	689716905158963201	2016-01-20T07:51:39	Noahpinion I think that's the issue that all of us -- the US, UK, AUS are facing.
kimmaicutler	689716728796880896	2016-01-20T07:50:57	Noahpinion I understand that that would work for urban areas w/ majority tenants.... but the state is majority homeowner.
kimmaicutler	689716496038146048	2016-01-20T07:50:01	Noahpinion we are 54.2% homeowner, with powerful real estate interests. JerryBrownGov said he doesn't want to touch it.
kimmaicutler	689716326093365248	2016-01-20T07:49:21	Noahpinion I mean quite literally, they want things to be affordable and they don't want things to change.
kimmaicutler	689716275409354753	2016-01-20T07:49:09	Noahpinion a lot of the most active voters don't want see stuff being built.
kimmaicutler	689716182962692097	2016-01-20T07:48:46	Noahpinion right, and that's the issue. I don't see a constituency existing for this unless homeownership rate drops well below 50% in CA.
kimmaicutler	689716034920513536	2016-01-20T07:48:11	Noahpinion whereas in urban areas, it's pricing out a lot of necessary workers.
kimmaicutler	689715998237163522	2016-01-20T07:48:02	Noahpinion in less dense areas, housing wealth is probably literally all people have.
kimmaicutler	689715954884935681	2016-01-20T07:47:52	Noahpinion I mean, would you apply it retroactively, or going forward? And it would have different effects on urban vs. rural vs. suburban
kimmaicutler	689715744192397312	2016-01-20T07:47:02	Noahpinion I am very, very interested in LVT, but Prop. 13 is extraordinarily powerful in this state.
kimmaicutler	689715667071676417	2016-01-20T07:46:43	Noahpinion wouldn't that destroy property values (at least initially or in the short-term)?

kimmaicutler	689714987107901440	2016-01-20T07:44:01	Noahpinion not sure you can solve this problem w/out destroying a lot of real estate wealth, and tanking the economy in the process.

kimmaicutler	689704673071083522	2016-01-20T07:03:02	asaxena but supply restrictions, fragmented government is also uniquely difficult. 
kimmaicutler	689638169751359488	2016-01-20T02:38:47	Noahpinion is America getting there?

kimmaicutler	686819109506437120	2016-01-12T07:56:50	ekriessmann bc there is nothing affordable in the vicinity of the area. A *public* elementary school district needing this much private
kimmaicutler	686818999816962049	2016-01-12T07:56:24	ekriessmann the elementary school district that I went to needs to probably raise like $60M just to build teacher housing projects.

kimmaicutler	686818869722271745	2016-01-12T07:55:53	ekriessmann sure, but I'm making a broader point about the nature of Californian and US urban development. That it comes with a cost.

kimmaicutler	686816469217247232	2016-01-12T07:46:21	ekriessmann made Marin great for your childhood, will exclude your children from enjoying that too.
kimmaicutler	686816400388698112	2016-01-12T07:46:04	ekriessmann yes, but at some point, you're going to be in a different phase of life. And realize that all the things that
kimmaicutler	686815731921457152	2016-01-12T07:43:25	ekriessmann that are worth $2M. You can do better w/ out touching the open space.
kimmaicutler	686815673545170944	2016-01-12T07:43:11	ekriessmann it is. And there are much more attractive, productive uses of land than crappy tract homes.
kimmaicutler	686815521249951745	2016-01-12T07:42:35	ekriessmann that's what a lot older folks down South are realizing. They've priced out their own children from being near them.

kimmaicutler	686815371194580992	2016-01-12T07:41:59	ekriessmann Dunno, when you get older and you realize you can't live near your parents when you have a family or you might have to live
kimmaicutler	686813443853172736	2016-01-12T07:34:20	ekriessmann that doesn't seem sustainable to me when you're making your future workforce pay 50% income on housing costs on average.
kimmaicutler	686813361414094849	2016-01-12T07:34:00	ekriessmann look at the average of what people born after 1990 are paying.
kimmaicutler	686813324030259200	2016-01-12T07:33:51	ekriessmann and the older generation is basically rentiering off of the younger one. 
kimmaicutler	686813181142929408	2016-01-12T07:33:17	ekriessmann I'm not saying a middle-class can come back. But it can choose other paths to mitigate what it's becoming.
kimmaicutler	686813075446448128	2016-01-12T07:32:52	ekriessmann It can choose other paths. It's becoming a dystopia.
kimmaicutler	686813006525677568	2016-01-12T07:32:35	ekriessmann no, my family's been here for 60 years. California was once a prosperous middle-class state. It chose to be something else.
kimmaicutler	686812064120111104	2016-01-12T07:28:51	ekriessmann are you planning to inherit your parents' house? Or do you have enough to buy a house in SF, Marin?
kimmaicutler	686811551685185536	2016-01-12T07:26:48	ekriessmann it's a policy that cements in extraordinarily deep income inequality.
kimmaicutler	686811503169675265	2016-01-12T07:26:37	ekriessmann you want policy that preserves a very expensive market for a few, that happens to subsidize a fraction of that for even fewer
kimmaicutler	686811291135037440	2016-01-12T07:25:46	ekriessmann those two statements are contradictory. 
kimmaicutler	686809050684592129	2016-01-12T07:16:52	ekriessmann do you care whether it's affordable? Whether your service workers, public servants can live there?
kimmaicutler	686806390854127617	2016-01-12T07:06:18	ekriessmann and this: 
kimmaicutler	686806166018498560	2016-01-12T07:05:24	ekriessmann by pulling stuff off like this: 
kimmaicutler	686806010166546432	2016-01-12T07:04:47	ekriessmann Marin didn't auto-magically stay at population ~250K for the last several decades. It did so intentionally.
kimmaicutler	686805283541102593	2016-01-12T07:01:54	ekriessmann you could do a lot of smarter stuff near the 101, w/out touching all that makes the rest of Marin beautiful.
kimmaicutler	686804726810148864	2016-01-12T06:59:41	ekriessmann Maybe you should pay a $100 commuter charge every time you cross a bridge to fund our affordable housing.
kimmaicutler	686804653552480256	2016-01-12T06:59:24	ekriessmann Marin needs to stop imposing excessively high housing costs on the rest of the region by not building.
