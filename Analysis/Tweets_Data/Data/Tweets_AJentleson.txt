AJentleson	704024948109668357	2016-02-28T19:26:42	So Trump isn't "defying all the rules" so much as confirming a theory that has had much empirical evidence to support it for a long time.
AJentleson	704015902333919233	2016-02-28T18:50:45	These sentiments have been popular with the GOP base for a long time. It is also true that saying them will be very damaging in the general.
