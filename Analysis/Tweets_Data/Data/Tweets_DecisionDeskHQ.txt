DecisionDeskHQ	717701198652919810	2016-04-06T13:11:14	Would have given a better picture. The precincts we had helped still with the D primary sample but threw SC off. (2/2)
DecisionDeskHQ	717700942016065536	2016-04-06T13:10:13	As Kloppenburg's performance in Milwaukee County overall was terrible, having, say, samples in Whitefish Bay and South Milwaukee (1/2)
DecisionDeskHQ	717700510862565376	2016-04-06T13:08:30	While happy with our primary exits, the SC attempt needed more MKE area precincts than we had time to fill.

DecisionDeskHQ	717523716624637953	2016-04-06T01:25:59	For subscribers, should start to see CD level results now.
DecisionDeskHQ	717523472050561025	2016-04-06T01:25:01	Trump briefly enjoying a lead in CD1 from the numbers out of Kenosha but as the rest rolls in will almost certainly flip to Cruz.
DecisionDeskHQ	717523188435914752	2016-04-06T01:23:53	Question is in which districts does Cruz win. Trump polled well in the NW, but with a large statewide margin for Cruz, he may get locked out
DecisionDeskHQ	717522871535280128	2016-04-06T01:22:38	Supreme Court numbers will likely take a while.
DecisionDeskHQ	717522759761272832	2016-04-06T01:22:11	Cruz and Sanders have both won
DecisionDeskHQ	717522473269329920	2016-04-06T01:21:03	With over 12,000 in Sanders up 58-42 so far
DecisionDeskHQ	717521612535238657	2016-04-06T01:17:37	Kenosha going to Trump early, Waukesha overwhelmingly to Cruz in early returns...
DecisionDeskHQ	717519723391365121	2016-04-06T01:10:07	Bradley could overperform her exit: no samples in far NW, limited in Green Bay. But performed weakly in the bellwethers we surveyed.
DecisionDeskHQ	717518376369696770	2016-04-06T01:04:46	And now, the actual results.

DecisionDeskHQ	717309102574014469	2016-04-05T11:13:11	It wouldn't shock us if total turnout exceeds 1.8 million voters statewide today.

DecisionDeskHQ	717172198222331904	2016-04-05T02:09:11	We also know there could be a range of outcomes CD to CD, so the more spots we can fill in, the better.
DecisionDeskHQ	717171803890655233	2016-04-05T02:07:37	We'd love for tomorrow's survey to come close to that level of accuracy. But at this late hour we still need people to make that happen.
DecisionDeskHQ	717171220525912065	2016-04-05T02:05:18	Our first exit survey, unweighted, came within 1% of Sanders and Trump's actual statewide vote share

DecisionDeskHQ	717138763902636032	2016-04-04T23:56:19	HunkerDownHokie if we are talking Waukesha, more like +25 or greater. Romney beat Santorum by &gt;30 in 2012 there.
DecisionDeskHQ	717138553302482944	2016-04-04T23:55:29	Frankly we're just giddy to be covering Wisconsin again. We've covered more races here than in any other state.
DecisionDeskHQ	717138285638758402	2016-04-04T23:54:25	It's tiny, but it almost always breaks for the winner in nailbiters, like the 2011 Prosser-Kloppenburg battle.
DecisionDeskHQ	717138151420989440	2016-04-04T23:53:53	For the State Supreme Court race, watch overall party primary participation, and if it gets close, keep an eye on Buffalo County.
DecisionDeskHQ	717137557549494274	2016-04-04T23:51:32	For Ted, watch Waukesha, Racine, Winnebago, Brown, Columbia. If he dominates, he's on his way to 4 CDs outright, and the state.
DecisionDeskHQ	717136959307526144	2016-04-04T23:49:09	For Donald, watch Barron, Marathon. He dominates, he takes CD7. He holds his own in La Crosse and Portage, CD3 too.
DecisionDeskHQ	717136413351759873	2016-04-04T23:46:59	However, if the CITY of Milwaukee splits more like the MULawPoll's findings, she's going to need a lot out of Green Bay and the Fox Cities.
DecisionDeskHQ	717136213761589248	2016-04-04T23:46:11	For Hillary, keep an eye on Milwaukee. Many of its suburbs favored her over Obama in 2008. If they stay firm she could potentially edge it.
DecisionDeskHQ	717135928049799168	2016-04-04T23:45:03	For Bernie, start with the obvious: Dane. La Crosse. Eau Claire. He'll be up big in the former and should be strong in the rest.
DecisionDeskHQ	717135164917157888	2016-04-04T23:42:01	That promotional stuff out of the way, where to watch for each of the top four candidates tomorrow night.

DecisionDeskHQ	716376495787089920	2016-04-02T21:27:20	Cruz could win statewide, and walk away with the most delegates, but Trump could win more CDs.

DecisionDeskHQ	701178464276078593	2016-02-20T22:55:47	I have a hunch the absentees will clue us in early on who came in 2nd, and whether it's a close loss to Trump. (BMF)
DecisionDeskHQ	701178334319783936	2016-02-20T22:55:16	Will the 2nd place finisher snag a Congressional District? Who is that 2nd place finisher? (BMF)

DecisionDeskHQ	701178032350859264	2016-02-20T22:54:04	If Trump's overall polling numbers hold, he wins. More interesting than that likely call (outside of a shocker), for me: (BMF)

DecisionDeskHQ	699330786097364992	2016-02-15T20:33:47	Curious to see which state delivers more on the ground help, Massachusetts or Alabama.
DecisionDeskHQ	699319946824691712	2016-02-15T19:50:42	We will also attempt to cover as many intriguing Congressional primaries as possible, but that will depend on size of volunteer pool.
DecisionDeskHQ	699319668486459392	2016-02-15T19:49:36	And a load and a half more.

DecisionDeskHQ	699282972835500036	2016-02-15T17:23:47	The Decision Desk HQ is now on facebook.  Join us there and bring your friends.  
DecisionDeskHQ	698939287086043136	2016-02-14T18:38:06	Since this project remains a labor of love, with no sponsors beyond GFM donors and newsletter subscribers, that's obviously not an option.
DecisionDeskHQ	698938942217846784	2016-02-14T18:36:44	The amount of time spent researching &amp; developing the NH exit makes a SC follow-up impossible, shy of our director abruptly quitting his job
DecisionDeskHQ	698938885762461696	2016-02-14T18:36:30	We are extremely proud of the result of our project in NH, so our next survey needs to be good, not a dud.
DecisionDeskHQ	698938669185404928	2016-02-14T18:35:39	A few emails and tweets asked why in the world we can't turn around and do a SC exit too. Well,
DecisionDeskHQ	698926571525046272	2016-02-14T17:47:34	We had roughly 24 volunteers rotating about to conduct our exit survey in New Hampshire. We will likely need many, many more for Florida.
DecisionDeskHQ	698925805313720320	2016-02-14T17:44:32	Due to time and financial constraints, no exit for SC. But we will conduct one in Florida.
DecisionDeskHQ	698925217855307777	2016-02-14T17:42:11	We also need volunteers on-the-ground in SC, so if you are free and can help the desk for about an hour, email brandon@decisiondeskhq.com
DecisionDeskHQ	698550623281623040	2016-02-13T16:53:41	If you live in either MA or AL, and can commit to helping us on 3/1, please contact brandon@decisiondeskhq.com

DecisionDeskHQ	697868120514392064	2016-02-11T19:41:40	The best way to support the Desk and make that Florida exit happen is to sign up for our newsletter/stay on as it switches to a paid one.
DecisionDeskHQ	697856658337193984	2016-02-11T18:56:07	But nobody, NOBODY, tells me "you can't do that."  So, we're doing it.
DecisionDeskHQ	697856477046804480	2016-02-11T18:55:24	This will require an effort thrice what we put out in NH at a minimum. Also, capital.
DecisionDeskHQ	697856271999864832	2016-02-11T18:54:35	So, I am announcing my intention to conduct another exit survey in the Florida Republican primary.
DecisionDeskHQ	697854098385666048	2016-02-11T18:45:57	It is my belief, though, that Florida's primary will carry a helluva lot of weight.
