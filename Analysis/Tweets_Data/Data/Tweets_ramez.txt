ramez	724014515319230465	2016-04-23T23:18:06	Storage benefits nuclear, but less than it benefits solar/wind. It hurts natural gas. And coal is dead regardless. 
ramez	724005717674336257	2016-04-23T22:43:09	Nuclear is incredibly safe. A lot safer than coal or gas. Waste can be managed. None of those is the problem.

ramez	724002657875034112	2016-04-23T22:30:59	I don't worry much about nuclear waste. It's fuel waiting to be used. I worry about the rising cost of nuclear. 
ramez	724001642064961536	2016-04-23T22:26:57	Nuclear is safe, clean, 24/7 power. It's also growing more expensive, while solar, wind, &amp; storage plunge in price.

ramez	723688250079109121	2016-04-23T01:41:38	bcshaffer Consider that early solar subsidies in Germany were equivalent to a multi-$100 C price. Crazy, right? But they lowered solar cost
ramez	723688082097070080	2016-04-23T01:40:58	bcshaffer Market shape isn't static. More RE deployment lowers RE prices. So a temporary push beyond fair C price can lower prices overall.
ramez	723683250804137984	2016-04-23T01:21:47	bcshaffer It's more about price gap. Which was larger in the past. (So RPS's good, and helped lower price.) Still big gap in some places.
ramez	723682662041292800	2016-04-23T01:19:26	bcshaffer At some point you don't need an RPS, to be honest. They're effective in times/places where RE isn't yet close to fossil  prices.

ramez	723680493670006784	2016-04-23T01:10:49	5. Ironic to me that the people at TheBTI, in particular, oppose carbon prices, one of few things that could save nuclear in the near term.
ramez	723679867913396224	2016-04-23T01:08:20	4. Should we, in addition to a price on carbon, also have renewable portfolio standards? Yes.   Direct R&amp;D funding? Yes.   It's "Yes, and."
ramez	723679461531480064	2016-04-23T01:06:43	3. Market "pull" mechanisms like carbon prices are most powerful tool for driving clean energy innovation we've seen 
ramez	723678763226034176	2016-04-23T01:03:57	2. A carbon tax is, arguably, the most effective tool (or among top few) we've ever seen for decarbonization. And yet woefully underused.
ramez	723678515225223168	2016-04-23T01:02:57	I agree w drvox that a carbon tax isn't a complete solution to climate change.   Don't know anyone who thinks it is.

ramez	692972402008006656	2016-01-29T07:27:50	trekonomics What bugs me is that Piketty's future model is pretty clearly not the reason for current inequality growth. Deep conflation.

ramez	688044831050862592	2016-01-15T17:07:25	nick_kapur ...Assumptions about how much value is missed can swing the view of how gains are distributed massively.
ramez	688044642391031808	2016-01-15T17:06:40	nick_kapur I think those are legit points. It's also possible to see CPI as missing much of the benefits new products delivered to masses.

ramez	688042713309122561	2016-01-15T16:59:00	nick_kapur Sure. But consumers of all wealth reap benefits from lower prices, increased capabilities. Tech has mostly leveled playing field
ramez	688042453954334724	2016-01-15T16:57:58	nick_kapur Wealth inequality might be the bigger problem. But on the topic of jobs destruction, income distribution is a more useful number
ramez	688041145310560256	2016-01-15T16:52:46	nick_kapur Mmm. He might have. And distribution of income, rather than wealth, probably more relevant for this topic.

ramez	686593022482464769	2016-01-11T16:58:27	robertjbennett elquesogrande1 I think it's still so early, it's very tough to call winners.
ramez	686470772316061696	2016-01-11T08:52:40	Bowie was about breaking barriers. Gender. Class. The barriers between art/poetry/music/film. He won't ever fully die. It's too obvious.
ramez	686472424775225344	2016-01-11T08:59:14	Begin with the end in mind: 
ramez	686449405776363520	2016-01-11T07:27:46	All the respect. Timelines match up to suggest Bowie was diagnosed and then got to work on creating a new album. 
ramez	686471717850488832	2016-01-11T08:56:26	SFReviewsnet Yeah. That was the tour.
ramez	686471228815609858	2016-01-11T08:54:29	I last saw Bowie with NIN. Soon after Iraq invasion.  He closed w "I'm Afraid of Americans". Said it was his last US tour.  I think it was.
ramez	686465394593251328	2016-01-11T08:31:18	Bowie would have been pleased.

ramez	686463043325198336	2016-01-11T08:21:58	Bowie's time with us would have been too short if he'd lived to be 200. And the work with which he filled the time he did have was glorious.
