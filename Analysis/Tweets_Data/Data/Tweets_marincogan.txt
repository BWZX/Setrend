marincogan	696157713286373377	2016-02-07T02:25:07	It's weird because Rubio *can* improvise. I've seen it! But someone told him to NEVER improvise, and it's resulted in this.
marincogan	696156947167326208	2016-02-07T02:22:04	Oh man Marco, let the talking point go. Let it go. Let it go.

marincogan	694472430652407808	2016-02-02T10:48:24	How does Cruz always look both happy and sad? "I like lasagna but it's not what I ordered", his face says. 
marincogan	696145346150297600	2016-02-07T01:35:58	Christie really masterfully exploited the talking point robot thing Rubio has going.
marincogan	696145097046380544	2016-02-07T01:34:59	I would kill for a cut away to Jeb Bush's face right now.
marincogan	696144873959739392	2016-02-07T01:34:06	Point: Christie.
marincogan	696144577737003009	2016-02-07T01:32:55	Huh...that was the most obvious critique of Rubio ever, and the response was...not great.

marincogan	696026954177220608	2016-02-06T17:45:32	Do you really think you would to better if you had to interact with strangers on a stage all day? You probably would not.
marincogan	696026712799211520	2016-02-06T17:44:34	The thing about Jeb's awkwardness or his cringeyness or whatever you want to call it is that I find it so utterly relatable.

marincogan	696014904042586112	2016-02-06T16:57:39	Jeb!: "the questions on the debate stage will probably be really stupid, to be honest with you."
marincogan	695455355384377348	2016-02-05T03:54:12	This debate will never end and someday they're gonna find my bone dry skeleton reaching for the power button on my lap top.

marincogan	695449427062882305	2016-02-05T03:30:38	The similarities between Bernie and my dad really never cease to overwhelm me.  
marincogan	695448142708285441	2016-02-05T03:25:32	Instead of electability, let's talk about abortion, or criminal justice, or the environment or literally thing else.
