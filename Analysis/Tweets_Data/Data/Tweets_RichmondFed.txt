RichmondFed	702486427687370753	2016-02-24T13:33:10	Lacker: The most important contribution central bankers can make to growth is low and stable inflation. 
RichmondFed	702485506022576128	2016-02-24T13:29:30	Lacker: Monetary stability is critical to economic growth.
RichmondFed	702484078663172096	2016-02-24T13:23:50	Lacker: Inflation expectations play an important role in determining actual inflation. 
RichmondFed	702483092661997568	2016-02-24T13:19:55	Lacker: Although inflation is running under Fed's 2% target, inflation measures suggest a likely move back toward target over medium term.
RichmondFed	702481776686592000	2016-02-24T13:14:41	Lacker: Monetary policy is uniquely capable of affecting the long-run price level through the process of money creation.
RichmondFed	702481058302992384	2016-02-24T13:11:50	Lacker: Monetary policy's effect on real economic activity is limited; temporary. Poorly executed monetary policy can impede growth.
