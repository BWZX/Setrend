LaurenLaCapra	723297221081444352	2016-04-21T23:47:50	guan no it absolutely matters. If you can go to a retailer and buy something for X but on eBay it's 100X why would you do that? Insane
LaurenLaCapra	723297006765125632	2016-04-21T23:46:59	guan idk I disagree with this thesis but maybe we have different lives and use eBay for different purchases!
LaurenLaCapra	723296839282384897	2016-04-21T23:46:19	guan zero
LaurenLaCapra	723296779354181634	2016-04-21T23:46:05	guan to me the value of eBay is getting expensive things for lower prices than retail but maybe I'm using it all wrong
LaurenLaCapra	723296653256568832	2016-04-21T23:45:34	guan that's second thing you mention is the real issue. Set a price in your mind and hold that limit. Especially on eBay!
LaurenLaCapra	723296508976746496	2016-04-21T23:45:00	guan idk I can't be at the ready to bid on eBay at any given moment. Same happens with concert tickets. I don't think that's unusual.

LaurenLaCapra	723295575681196032	2016-04-21T23:41:18	guan still doesn't make sense to me. In simple terms I bid up to what I'm willing to pay and if I don't win I don't win.
LaurenLaCapra	723295245094510592	2016-04-21T23:39:59	guan why would you ever bid more than what you want to pay or can afford....?
LaurenLaCapra	723295058586439680	2016-04-21T23:39:14	guan I mean, I guess it depends what it is. If you're bidding on a kidney--by all means pay whatever.
LaurenLaCapra	723294837609500672	2016-04-21T23:38:22	guan what? No
LaurenLaCapra	723294497153683456	2016-04-21T23:37:00	guan it just depends how bad you want it and how much you're willing to pay
