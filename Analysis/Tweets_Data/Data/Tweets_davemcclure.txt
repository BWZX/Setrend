davemcclure	697809168841834496	2016-02-11T15:47:25	not "Twitter is Pearl Jam not U2", rather "Twitter is great band w/ shitty manager who lets band do too many drugs" 
davemcclure	697807969770024960	2016-02-11T15:42:39	umm, no: Twitter problems aren't bcz "too much ambition"; more simply lack of product mgmt / UX leadership at top 
davemcclure	697611170031628289	2016-02-11T02:40:38	Twitter should lower ambitions, but not how fmanjoo suggests (Donations? lol)   Focus on revenue per user, not user#
