pete_wells	718096281692999680	2016-04-07T15:21:09	It is a sad day in America when Trillin's obviously ironic doggerel Chinese food poem in the New Yorker is being vilified by the pc police.

pete_wells	718074633182973952	2016-04-07T13:55:08	Part of the problem is that you have to have been reading chowhound for at least 15 years to know what Trillin's poem is lampooning.
pete_wells	717820063324221440	2016-04-06T21:03:34	andreaburzynski I'm saying let's get a little perspective and maybe ask how many food writers are even aware of, say, Uighur cuisine.

pete_wells	717817356727267331	2016-04-06T20:52:48	nhallfreelance I think you are missing the tone, this is a writer who has waxed enthusiastic about regional chinese food for decades.
pete_wells	717816414434930690	2016-04-06T20:49:04	jmiyazawa In what sense is it reductive? Reducing a country to its food? Trillin has been doing that for years.
pete_wells	717815809867907072	2016-04-06T20:46:40	karenkho  Trillin understands  there are many Chinese regional cuisines while some writers still think of it all as "Chinese food"
pete_wells	717815509853597696	2016-04-06T20:45:28	nhallfreelance What is myopic about naming the provinces of China that are most commonly represented in NYC restaurants?

pete_wells	717812740321050624	2016-04-06T20:34:28	Before we beat Trillin to a pulp let's remember there are professional food writers who think "Asian food" is a meaningful phrase.
