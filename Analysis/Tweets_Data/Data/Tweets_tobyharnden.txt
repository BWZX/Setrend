tobyharnden	705625395840745472	2016-03-04T05:26:18	Isn't this one of the biggest problems with the Cruz-Rubio "unity ticket" idea? Cruz pretty emphatically against it.

tobyharnden	705615646223106048	2016-03-04T04:47:34	A very small moment

tobyharnden	705609568366235649	2016-03-04T04:23:25	Not really because in a GOP primary, Clinton is seen as the ultimate threat 
tobyharnden	705608902990233600	2016-03-04T04:20:46	Kinda funny that Trump, a germaphobe who hates handshakes, offered handshake to a guy with a bad cold &amp; got dissed

tobyharnden	705586557059727360	2016-03-04T02:51:59	So Trump really does view his whole thing as a dick-measuring contest  
tobyharnden	705585859698028544	2016-03-04T02:49:12	Seems so 
tobyharnden	705583592873840640	2016-03-04T02:40:12	Impressive how he managed to say that with a straight face 
tobyharnden	705573831231082498	2016-03-04T02:01:24	Yeah, Trump was totally suggesting he could have ordered Romney to pray

tobyharnden	705441891836420098	2016-03-03T17:17:08	Hard to imagine there isn't a bit of Romney that's fantasizing about riding into contested GOP convention in shiny armor atop a white horse
tobyharnden	705440733923250176	2016-03-03T17:12:32	This is the problem 
tobyharnden	705440244263419905	2016-03-03T17:10:35	Powerful cri de coeur from Romney, who's a flawed messenger but laid out long-shot case for Rubio-Cruz-Kasich  contested convention strategy

tobyharnden	705410090673807361	2016-03-03T15:10:46	Take note 
tobyharnden	705408850183200768	2016-03-03T15:05:50	Bhamalpha Agree but I think Romney kind of doesn't have standing on issue of Trump
tobyharnden	705408658050572290	2016-03-03T15:05:04	This is, you know, problematic. Not getting free ride - people are voting 4 him. White knight at conv gets free ride 
tobyharnden	705399317973098496	2016-03-03T14:27:57	Doesn't Romney branding Trump - whose endorsement he sought &amp; got - a phony just underline Trump message re politics as usual &amp; hypocrisy?
tobyharnden	705383105125810177	2016-03-03T13:23:32	Call me unimaginative, but I'm not quite sure how a speech from Mitt Romney helps the anti-Trump effort
tobyharnden	705375706587332609	2016-03-03T12:54:08	Between the calendar and sore-loser laws, I think we're stuck with him. 
tobyharnden	705186864328777729	2016-03-03T00:23:44	A huge amount of Trump's "conservative" "support" is bought and paid for. Inarguable. And sad.

tobyharnden	704900248070709249	2016-03-02T05:24:50	Fascinating - DanaBashCNN reports that RealBenCarson might be approached by D.C. Republicans to run for MarcoRubio's Senate seat.
tobyharnden	704898681401708544	2016-03-02T05:18:36	Except the Republican party 
tobyharnden	704898538128470017	2016-03-02T05:18:02	Sure, Rubio or Cruz *could* win GOP nomination. But we are all twisting ourselves into pretzels to come up with the scenarios.
tobyharnden	704898168878661632	2016-03-02T05:16:34	But winning matters &amp; elections are psychological not just mathematical - winning Virginia would've been significant 
tobyharnden	704897481637806081	2016-03-02T05:13:50	True, except for "very plausible", read "uphill &amp; extraordinarily narrow"

tobyharnden	704893144450605056	2016-03-02T04:56:36	So estab GOP seems to be abandoning idea of one anti-Trump, embracing notion of group anti-Trump effort &amp; contested convention

tobyharnden	704880239411912704	2016-03-02T04:05:19	katiepack I see your point
tobyharnden	704880105189974020	2016-03-02T04:04:47	NickyWoolf LarryClarkIII I think open means contested convention, which is no one has majority. Brokered = party elders stepping in.
tobyharnden	704879690167799809	2016-03-02T04:03:08	What if Rubio, Kasich drop out, campaign for Cruz in FL, OH? Seems like better bet than hoping for R &amp; K wins there

tobyharnden	704877898520469504	2016-03-02T03:56:01	The theory of everyone staying in GOP race to force a contested convention has a big flaw: Trump would win winner-takes-all states
tobyharnden	704877176529797120	2016-03-02T03:53:09	Thanks. I'm an American citizen and have been here for 14 years. 
tobyharnden	704876826288648193	2016-03-02T03:51:46	This is a huge part of tonight. Can Rubio justify staying in race if he gets 0 out of 155 delegates in Texas? 
tobyharnden	704876041991536641	2016-03-02T03:48:39	Yep, certainly is 
tobyharnden	704875676827033600	2016-03-02T03:47:11	Tonight is a test of honesty of NeverTrump movement. If that's the true aim, then rallying behind Cruz not Rubio has to be serious option.
tobyharnden	704855741958643714	2016-03-02T02:27:59	Tonight is an almost perfect result for Trump because not only is he the overwhelming winner but the opposition to him is utterly divided.
tobyharnden	704853894128668673	2016-03-02T02:20:38	If Rubio drops out, endorses Cruz it's possible Trump could be defeated. Otherwise hard to see how Trump is stopped.
tobyharnden	704853485930549248	2016-03-02T02:19:01	This delegate count plus fact Cruz won Texas &amp; Oklahoma should lead to pressure on Rubio to drop out &amp; back Cruz. 
tobyharnden	704851375189041152	2016-03-02T02:10:38	If Rubio fails to make 20% threshold in Texas, Cruz wins Texas, Oklahoma &amp; Trump everywhere else that's a miserable SuperTuesday for Rubio
tobyharnden	704850427041468416	2016-03-02T02:06:51	Resounding win for Cruz. And Rubio needs to pass 20% threshold to get any delegates there.
