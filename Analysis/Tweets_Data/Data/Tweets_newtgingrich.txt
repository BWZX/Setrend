newtgingrich	692910408932409349	2016-01-29T03:21:29	Great Christie line" the days of the Clintons in public housing are over"
newtgingrich	692910046611640320	2016-01-29T03:20:03	Rubio "bernie sanders would be good candidate for Sweden but not america" very tough on Hillary disqualified to be president
newtgingrich	692909330023215106	2016-01-29T03:17:12	Jeb Bush well prepared for electability question.
newtgingrich	692909068130848768	2016-01-29T03:16:10	Cruz well prepared for question about lack of senatorial endorsements. Turns it into proof of outsider status.
newtgingrich	692908127801511937	2016-01-29T03:12:25	Christie puts down all three senators in his continuing effort to say governors make decisions not just speeches.
newtgingrich	692907634035421186	2016-01-29T03:10:28	Rand Paul very tough in taking on Cruz on immigration.Spirited reply by Cruz.Rubio now siding with Paul against Cruz.Cruz fighting 2 fronts

newtgingrich	692903890233266176	2016-01-29T02:55:35	This is a very substance focused debate.
newtgingrich	692903484174245888	2016-01-29T02:53:58	Jeb Bush exactly right on getting Puerto Rico's finances in order with no federal taxpayer bailout.Will need a federal control board.

newtgingrich	692900890055847936	2016-01-29T02:43:40	Jeb Bush's focus on overhauling the Veterans Administration is exactly right and his pledge to fire the incompetent is refreshing
newtgingrich	692899750668939266	2016-01-29T02:39:08	I love it when dr carson says we need to stop letting political correctness define our policies.
newtgingrich	692898815913820161	2016-01-29T02:35:25	Bush effective in saying we have to get lawyers off the backs of the military. A big problem weakening our military and intelligence efforts
newtgingrich	692898450338217985	2016-01-29T02:33:58	Rubio very effective defining Radical Islamist with violence talk leading to violent actions .

newtgingrich	692897755509817344	2016-01-29T02:31:12	Cruz is hurting himself with overly pushy approach to trying to redefine the debate and seize time hurts him and makes him smaller
newtgingrich	692897141719638016	2016-01-29T02:28:46	Carson's line he had more 2 am life and death phone calls than anyone else in race is profound if you forget politics and just reflect on it
newtgingrich	692896262081814529	2016-01-29T02:25:16	Kasich's string of New Hampshire newspaper endorsements is very impressive.substance and optimism are having an impact.
newtgingrich	692894844407054336	2016-01-29T02:19:38	Chris Wallace is doing a good job of asking pointed but nit hostile questions
newtgingrich	692894511505100800	2016-01-29T02:18:19	With Trump gone Dr Carson is the clear citizen candidate on this stage. His decency and intelligence serve him well.

newtgingrich	692892349362368515	2016-01-29T02:09:44	Jeb Bush's enthusiasm for his family is authentic and makes him more believable.
newtgingrich	692892147154972673	2016-01-29T02:08:55	Marco Rubio's reminder that Hillary Clinton might appoint President Obama to the Supreme Court is going to ve a powerful issue.

newtgingrich	692861996081917954	2016-01-29T00:09:07	The great danger for realDonaldTrump of not showing up is that he is giving space for someone else to emerge.

newtgingrich	687850000458629121	2016-01-15T04:13:14	Rubio taking on cruz is pretty effective with clearly prepared list of 11 assaults.audience not sympathetic to cruz counterattack.
newtgingrich	687847693163585537	2016-01-15T04:04:04	Very strong Christie answer on crime and Obama' s support for the criminal over the police. It may be Christie's best answer of the night
newtgingrich	687845747082006533	2016-01-15T03:56:20	Trump on business issues has a totally different range of knowledge from the other candidates. It is probably his strongest area in policy
newtgingrich	687845386288001024	2016-01-15T03:54:54	The exchange on taxes between Cruz and Rubio is factual, serious and policy debate at its best
newtgingrich	687840726453977089	2016-01-15T03:36:23	Kasich defense of Trump on China and Trump's "i like him tonight" an interesting exchange. Kasich sustains Trump's core point on China
newtgingrich	687840229835849728	2016-01-15T03:34:24	Trump on China is very compelling. I suspect he is winning this argument.
newtgingrich	687838642950254592	2016-01-15T03:28:06	Rubio is much firmer and tougher in this debate
newtgingrich	687838083836973056	2016-01-15T03:25:53	Very sound response by Kasich distinguishing Syrian refugees from our allies in the region
newtgingrich	687837609435992064	2016-01-15T03:24:00	Jeb Bush response to Trump on Muslim position strong and coherent.Trump response "I want security for this country" may explain poll numbers
newtgingrich	687836943367929856	2016-01-15T03:21:21	Trump. Answer on rethinking Muslim comments "no". He explains why it has to be thought through and not be "the stupid country"

newtgingrich	687830729322029056	2016-01-15T02:56:39	Rubio just hit the Second amendment question out of the park. He is methodically taking apart the Obama argument on guns.
newtgingrich	687828444051275776	2016-01-15T02:47:34	Ben Carson's answer on Bill and Hillary with tough description of decay of America by secular progressives is his best answer of campaign.

newtgingrich	687827617559494656	2016-01-15T02:44:17	Kasich response on Sanders "we will carry every state" may be right. Sanders could be the new George MCGovern.
newtgingrich	687827387506098176	2016-01-15T02:43:23	Carson doing a good job reinforcing the Christie-Bush plea for all the candidates to focus on beating Hillary.
newtgingrich	687827080290107393	2016-01-15T02:42:09	Jeb Bush's assertion that everyone on the stage is better than Hillary. He continues his best performance of the campaign so far.
newtgingrich	687826764945571840	2016-01-15T02:40:54	Chris Christie doing a good job defending his record.
newtgingrich	687826103352848385	2016-01-15T02:38:16	Trump doing a good job of explaining his anger. Millions of angry Americans probably agree with Trump's anger. Explains his poll numbers.
newtgingrich	687825208342876160	2016-01-15T02:34:43	This 'birther' exchange illustrates how smart ted cruz is and how irrepressible Trump is.great theater but not relevant to governing.
newtgingrich	687822542770434048	2016-01-15T02:24:07	Cruz handled the New York Times hit piece pretty well.
newtgingrich	687822423018831874	2016-01-15T02:23:39	Trump is knocking the refugee question out of the park. He identifies American safety as more important than male Syrian refugees.
newtgingrich	687820631589650432	2016-01-15T02:16:32	Marco Rubio is the toughest, most aggressive he has been in his first answer. These candidates have brought their A game.
newtgingrich	687820350781046784	2016-01-15T02:15:25	Jeb Bush's first answer is most intense, most aggressive, most competent he has been in entire campaign.This is best prepared he has been.
newtgingrich	687819854154457089	2016-01-15T02:13:26	Kasich's focus on job creators and the need to give them both incentives and confidence to create jobs is exactly right.
newtgingrich	687819156352299008	2016-01-15T02:10:40	Christie's describing the State of the Union as "story time with Barack Obama" is very clever
newtgingrich	687818332448382978	2016-01-15T02:07:24	Ted cruz had a very good opening focusing on our sailors and Iranian.He is also smart to unify the entire team of candidates in his opening.

newtgingrich	687816427177246720	2016-01-15T01:59:49	Can tedcruz withstand what will probably be a withering attack from everyone. Many candidates more comfortable attacking Cruz than Trump
newtgingrich	687815713348825088	2016-01-15T01:56:59	Can RealBenCarson be assertive, compelling enough to relaunch his candidacy. He's still at #4 so recovery possible 
newtgingrich	687815277623554048	2016-01-15T01:55:15	I am really looking forward to tonights debate on fox business channel. This debate could clarify a lot about the candidates.

newtgingrich	687750981422039041	2016-01-14T21:39:46	It is so disgusting to see the State Dept spokesman defend the Iranian abuse of our sailors that it would legitimize defunding his office.
