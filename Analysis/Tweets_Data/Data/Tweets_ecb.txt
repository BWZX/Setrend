ecb	723140637248245760	2016-04-21T13:25:37	Draghi: We view the participation of the UK to the European Union as mutually beneficial
ecb	723139591926996993	2016-04-21T13:21:28	Draghi: Our policies are the same policies that have been enacted in other parts of the world
ecb	723138573419970560	2016-04-21T13:17:25	Draghi: Real interest rates today are higher than they were 20, 30 years ago
ecb	723138460643516416	2016-04-21T13:16:58	Draghi: Low interest rates are a symptom of low growth. If we want higher rates, we need higher growth and inflation
ecb	723137223105769472	2016-04-21T13:12:03	Draghi: With rare exceptions, monetary policy has been the only policy in the last 4 years to support growth
ecb	723136009781694464	2016-04-21T13:07:14	Draghi: The experience with negative rates has been broadly positive for the ECB
ecb	723135863157215233	2016-04-21T13:06:39	Draghi: In the first full year of negative interest rates profitability of banks has gone up
ecb	723134811221544960	2016-04-21T13:02:28	Draghi: Broad financing conditions have improved since we took measures in March
ecb	723132537107685376	2016-04-21T12:53:26	Draghi: The Governing Council was unanimous in defending the independendence of the ECB
ecb	723132303082299394	2016-04-21T12:52:30	Draghi: We obey the law, not politicians
ecb	723132206634274817	2016-04-21T12:52:07	Draghi: We have a mandate to pursue price stability for the whole of the euro area
ecb	723130601914527745	2016-04-21T12:45:45	Draghi: In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively
ecb	723130230722818048	2016-04-21T12:44:16	Draghi: Overall, our measures in place since June 2014 have clearly improved borrowing conditions for firms and households
ecb	723129328314159104	2016-04-21T12:40:41	Draghi: Recovery still dampened by balance sheet adjustments, insufficient pace of structural reforms and subdued growth in emerging markets
ecb	723129154271485952	2016-04-21T12:40:00	Draghi: Domestic demand continues to be supported by our monetary policy measures
ecb	723128951615283202	2016-04-21T12:39:11	Draghi: Crucial to ensure that the very low inflation environment does not become entrenched in 2nd-round effects on wage and price setting
ecb	723128697260122112	2016-04-21T12:38:11	Draghi: Looking forward, it is essential to preserve an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation as long as needed
ecb	723128594814246912	2016-04-21T12:37:46	Draghi: Following our comprehensive package of decisions taken in early March, broad financing conditions in the euro area have improved
ecb	723128536010121216	2016-04-21T12:37:32	Draghi: Further information on the implementation aspects of the CSPP will be released after the press conference on the ECB’s website
ecb	723128446017097728	2016-04-21T12:37:11	Draghi: In June we will conduct the first of our new TLTROs and we will start purchases under our corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP)

ecb	723128271068487680	2016-04-21T12:36:29	Draghi: We continue to expect rates to remain at present or lower levels for extended period of time; well past horizon of asset purchases
