pdmsero	694876122463539200	2016-02-03T13:32:32	DefunctEcon Because elasticity of tax collection ensured that any increases in debt are seen as sustainable and therefore stimulative.
pdmsero	694875009551097856	2016-02-03T13:28:07	DefunctEcon Effect on spreads is so strong that private spending collapses by more than government spending increases. So no inflation.
pdmsero	694874877938003968	2016-02-03T13:27:35	DefunctEcon The point is that spending *won’t* be inflationary because it won’t be expansionary to begin with!
pdmsero	694874539088568320	2016-02-03T13:26:14	DefunctEcon WE predict that the multiplier is *always* &gt;1, always, no matter what, always. A country at ZLB would *never* go bankrupt.
pdmsero	694874017220710403	2016-02-03T13:24:10	DefunctEcon Raise inflation in the Euroarea? I’d suggest that that’s highly implausible.
pdmsero	694873772373983233	2016-02-03T13:23:12	DefunctEcon It’s the exact same model plus sovereign risk and financial intermediation. You can even recover WE results from that model!
pdmsero	694873469922754561	2016-02-03T13:22:00	DefunctEcon So at the ZLB, if Portuguese debt increases to 400% of GDP, Portuguese spreads wouldn’t budge? IS that the argument.
pdmsero	694873306609106944	2016-02-03T13:21:21	DefunctEcon Right, so the mandate question is orthogonal to its asset purchase policy wrt to Portugal and Greece.
pdmsero	694873198186332161	2016-02-03T13:20:55	DefunctEcon It’s the same model that gives you large, positive multipliers at the ZLB to begin with!
pdmsero	694873110022111232	2016-02-03T13:20:34	DefunctEcon Why do you insist on calling it as quantity theory? The paper is a standard Woodford/Eggertsson framework with bells/whistles.
pdmsero	694872674372296704	2016-02-03T13:18:50	DefunctEcon Question of mandate is pretty moot, both countries matter virtually nothing for price stability in whole of euro area.
pdmsero	694872534425210880	2016-02-03T13:18:16	DefunctEcon So ECB acts illegally if it does not purchase as many bonds as Portugal/Greece decide, in their infinite wisdom, to issue?
pdmsero	694872227985154048	2016-02-03T13:17:03	DefunctEcon Because that is very much the logical corollary of that position. No country would ever have gone bankrupt if that were true.
pdmsero	694872082249814016	2016-02-03T13:16:29	DefunctEcon So your contention is then that a bankrupt country could reverse bankruptcy with a daring plan of just asking for more money?
pdmsero	694871638337314816	2016-02-03T13:14:43	DefunctEcon If Greece or Portugal decide to expand issuance by 50%, do you really think ECB will just accommodate? I’d argue they will not.
pdmsero	694871453477507072	2016-02-03T13:13:59	DefunctEcon And you can’t just wave that away by saying the ECB will just make sure it won’t happen again. They will most certainly will.
pdmsero	694871338167767040	2016-02-03T13:13:31	DefunctEcon The graph I showed you provides precisely that empirical reason. Spreads are most definitely not zero.
pdmsero	694871143895982080	2016-02-03T13:12:45	DefunctEcon It’s basically engaging in large scale helicopter drops. Having an inflation target becomes inconsistent with that policy.
pdmsero	694870944913956864	2016-02-03T13:11:58	DefunctEcon Correct, but if CB permanently expands liabilities and backs them up with PNV 0 assets, it loses control over M and therefore i
pdmsero	694870609554202624	2016-02-03T13:10:38	DefunctEcon In that case, multiplier depends on the size of the elasticity of taxes. If country unwilling/incapable of collecting, &lt;0.
pdmsero	694870466180288512	2016-02-03T13:10:03	DefunctEcon And? i=0 at ZLB and spread is still a function of spending-taxable income at some future later date, so could well increase.
pdmsero	694870046762471425	2016-02-03T13:08:23	DefunctEcon Should CB buy assets that could very well be worth 0 as part of its asset purchase policy? Maybe, but not clear optimal policy.
pdmsero	694869712711335941	2016-02-03T13:07:04	DefunctEcon Suppose I’m Germany and decide to finance increase in spending of 200% of GDP by issuing debt. Should CB bring down yield?
pdmsero	694869487645036544	2016-02-03T13:06:10	DefunctEcon I don’t quite see where you get that optimal CB policy in a currency area is to ensure spread on debt is always zero.
pdmsero	694869353729257472	2016-02-03T13:05:38	DefunctEcon (…) is just a commitment device to ensure high future inflation. That is, all the bite is coming from monetary policy.
pdmsero	694869237995851777	2016-02-03T13:05:11	DefunctEcon Even if CB sets rates at 0, then it can only counteract effect on spreads through unlimited QE and arguably spending then (…)
pdmsero	694868813129637888	2016-02-03T13:03:29	DefunctEcon If you think the ECB’s MRO rate is an adequate proxy for yields on Portuguese/Greek debt, then I’d definitely call that sci fi.
pdmsero	694868234428903425	2016-02-03T13:01:11	DefunctEcon And what is sci fi, as far as I’m concerned, is buying a model in which you’re implicitly setting that spread to 0.
pdmsero	694868118439645184	2016-02-03T13:00:44	DefunctEcon If you think that sovereign yields don’t and shouldn’t matter, then we have a diametrically opposed view on this matter.
pdmsero	694867779543904257	2016-02-03T12:59:23	DefunctEcon Takes into account the feedback loop between spending and output through multiplier. So all hinges on ability to collect taxes.
pdmsero	694867607816704000	2016-02-03T12:58:42	DefunctEcon Ability to collect being a function of the tax elasticity to income and future income. So if that increases, so does spread.
pdmsero	694867446331736064	2016-02-03T12:58:03	DefunctEcon i~0, but w, the spread between sovereign yield and i, will increase with difference between spending and ability to collect.
pdmsero	694854955941957634	2016-02-03T12:08:25	DefunctEcon If not, then it arguably should. Euro area examples not illustrative because of central bank intervening in the interim.
pdmsero	694854764438384640	2016-02-03T12:07:40	DefunctEcon If a country is already on an unsustainable path, then arguably upward movement in yields already impossible to stop -&gt; default
pdmsero	694853870627983360	2016-02-03T12:04:07	DefunctEcon will, I contend, face higher borrowing costs. Is that outrageous?
pdmsero	694853771130703876	2016-02-03T12:03:43	DefunctEcon Ok, simple point: any given country borrowing more with crummy tax collection, a central bank that cannot offset spreads (…)
pdmsero	694853421766148096	2016-02-03T12:02:20	DefunctEcon Can’t take ojblanchard1’s linear estimates across all economies and argue they apply across the board.
pdmsero	694853305512517632	2016-02-03T12:01:52	DefunctEcon Plus, the other paper I sent you had proper metrics and an estimate of a negative multiplier for high debt to GDP levels.
pdmsero	694853074880466944	2016-02-03T12:00:57	DefunctEcon This is the point you find contentious and the point that is central for the prediction of a negative multiplier.
pdmsero	694852964717043713	2016-02-03T12:00:31	DefunctEcon So in your view, a country that borrows more with a CB that cannot offset effect on spreads will not face higher yields?
pdmsero	694852782537441280	2016-02-03T11:59:47	DefunctEcon This with *all* the ratings agencies reviewing their guidance on PT, for example, negatively? Hard to believe.
pdmsero	694852615075713025	2016-02-03T11:59:07	DefunctEcon Sure. Is your argument that if Portugal or Greece went to markets right now, they wouldn’t have to pay higher yields?
pdmsero	694852375547383809	2016-02-03T11:58:10	DefunctEcon I’m a bit baffled here, so any paper that reports estimates you don’t like gets called sci fi, even if it uses proper metrics?
pdmsero	694852139781361664	2016-02-03T11:57:14	DefunctEcon Arguably, Greece was too far along already and were it fiscal and monetarily independent, it should have defaulted outright.
pdmsero	694851965172465664	2016-02-03T11:56:32	DefunctEcon Plus, you can’t tease out effect of fiscal consolidation when the ECB is busy lowering spreads through SMP, OMT &amp; such.
pdmsero	694851769084579841	2016-02-03T11:55:46	DefunctEcon How is it quantity of theory? This is a pretty standard NK model with sovereign risk. Unless you think latter irrelevant :)
pdmsero	694849953726881792	2016-02-03T11:48:33	DefunctEcon ojblanchard1 To a self-financed increase in government spending in Portugal? I would argue that they would not apply.
pdmsero	694849299281244164	2016-02-03T11:45:57	DefunctEcon The chapter has lots of different estimates, and some it lists fall in the range of the Blanchard ones. Can’t pick &amp; choose!
pdmsero	694849075498336256	2016-02-03T11:45:03	DefunctEcon What do you mean “shot above estimates”? You can’t take one WP and basically claim everything else before it is meaningless.
pdmsero	694848339708375040	2016-02-03T11:42:08	DefunctEcon “Whatever it takes” has a large footnote saying “Provided you do exactly what we tell you to do”.
pdmsero	694848222439837698	2016-02-03T11:41:40	DefunctEcon You can argue ECB will do *some* to prevent that happening, but there are limits to purchases from certain countries.
pdmsero	694848084740849664	2016-02-03T11:41:07	DefunctEcon But, and this is the rub, they don’t apply to a country that cannot finance itself on the cheap. Effect on yields devastating.
pdmsero	694847967476477952	2016-02-03T11:40:39	DefunctEcon Most multipliers in the literature are pretty high and suggest much larger effects in recessions than expansions, so fair.
pdmsero	694847776618909696	2016-02-03T11:39:54	DefunctEcon Empirical research I showed you indicates: 1) lower (linear) multipliers for Europe than US, 2) small (negative) for high D/GDP
pdmsero	694847585052401664	2016-02-03T11:39:08	DefunctEcon No, sorry, that was a chapter in a book. It’s a review piece, mostly, so hard to demolish. He cites authors approvingly though.
pdmsero	694847137465667588	2016-02-03T11:37:21	DefunctEcon The paper I linked to doesn’t show up in the references for that Blanchard one, so I wouldn’t have thought so.
pdmsero	694846819264827393	2016-02-03T11:36:05	DefunctEcon Had it genuinely tried to test the water, I’m convinced it would have found it to be pretty cold.
pdmsero	694846730781728770	2016-02-03T11:35:44	DefunctEcon Not at all. Reason yields have stayed low is because Portugal has kept to ECB allotment, otherwise it would have tested water.
pdmsero	694845594523811840	2016-02-03T11:31:13	DefunctEcon It’s far more sci fi to argue a bankrupt country can borrow at will in financial markets with no adverse consequences.
pdmsero	694845486864437249	2016-02-03T11:30:48	DefunctEcon Surely you jest: 
pdmsero	694844577094733824	2016-02-03T11:27:11	DefunctEcon Size of (linear) multipliers in Europe much smaller than US, between 0.5-0.7, see chapter 12 of 
pdmsero	694844048352370688	2016-02-03T11:25:05	DefunctEcon Multipliers can be negative when public debt exceeds certain % of GDP -&gt; 
pdmsero	694843885353328640	2016-02-03T11:24:26	DefunctEcon If Portugal borrows more to spend, yields would rise enough to counteract the effect of the stimulus -&gt; 
pdmsero	694841887946051584	2016-02-03T11:16:30	DefunctEcon (…) then I think we can both argue that a permanent transfer from the rest of the EU to Portugal will increase output :)
pdmsero	694841762385391616	2016-02-03T11:16:00	DefunctEcon And over the stance of fiscal policy; if self-financed, multiplier likely very small or negative. If financed by EU (…)
pdmsero	694841567920652288	2016-02-03T11:15:13	DefunctEcon I’m not sure they were wrong on the bank resolution, actually, whole thing was an ungodly mess with the EU’s finger on it.
pdmsero	694840477170941952	2016-02-03T11:10:53	DefunctEcon Which it did over the bank resolution thing. SDP basically made sure they avoided a huge political crisis less than a month in.
pdmsero	694840296635514880	2016-02-03T11:10:10	DefunctEcon One important criticism of this “coalition” is that it simply wasn’t comprehensive enough and risked almost immediate breakdown
pdmsero	694840144952705024	2016-02-03T11:09:34	DefunctEcon There’s always *some* margin, as the piece implies, but that margin always means minority dictates the terms of the agreement.
pdmsero	694839436421545984	2016-02-03T11:06:45	DefunctEcon And I’m really not being critical of the left wing parties, it’s absolutely right they do what their constituencies demand.
pdmsero	694839262978641920	2016-02-03T11:06:04	DefunctEcon I’d argue that it is because it removes any negotiating margin there might have existed if SP were in power by themselves.
pdmsero	694837804275240960	2016-02-03T11:00:16	DefunctEcon The recent Banif resolution would not have passed had the SP not relied on support from the SDP in parliament.
pdmsero	694837655079665664	2016-02-03T10:59:41	DefunctEcon Plus, it’s less of a coalition and more of a “we’ll keep you in power for as long as you do what we tell you to do”.
pdmsero	694837532501110785	2016-02-03T10:59:11	DefunctEcon Yes, but given SP’s past involvement with Europe, it’s clear that any refusal to meet EU halfway is driven by junior partners.
pdmsero	694837021668462592	2016-02-03T10:57:10	DefunctEcon But also clear that we’re talking about policy being effectively dictated by them, for better or worse.
pdmsero	694836740197056512	2016-02-03T10:56:02	DefunctEcon Definitely not a criticism! Left just ensuring they get what they want, which is absolutely fair enough.
pdmsero	694835058293743616	2016-02-03T10:49:21	DefunctEcon Not at all, hence the reminder. No formal coalition that anyone voted *for* explicit or implicitly though.
pdmsero	694830412422615040	2016-02-03T10:30:54	Portuguese left make sure Government knows who holds the power. | Louçã: Se Costa recuar haverá "crise política"

pdmsero	693445282261024768	2016-01-30T14:46:53	iarroyo48 Slight back and forth between new executive and EU commission, but new government has intransigent “coalition” partners.

pdmsero	692474365049446400	2016-01-27T22:28:48	JoMicheII Agreed, a pleasure as always.
pdmsero	692474044667555840	2016-01-27T22:27:32	JoMicheII It is, and I’m in the middle of writing lecture notes!
pdmsero	692473991747993600	2016-01-27T22:27:19	JoMicheII In truth, it took me a long time to understand them as the limit of an optimality condition, so I remain in awe of them.
pdmsero	692473636624732164	2016-01-27T22:25:55	JoMicheII I see it as precisely that, barter except one of the goods is cash, which has lots of interesting and useful properties.
pdmsero	692473351697207298	2016-01-27T22:24:47	JoMicheII I have the “buying property is not an investment” conversation so many times it’s not even funny, but nobody ever listens.
pdmsero	692472823324000259	2016-01-27T22:22:41	JoMicheII Oddly enough given that I don’t really, really understand them, I’m very fond of transversality conditions.
pdmsero	692472609087295488	2016-01-27T22:21:50	JoMicheII True, it’s the old game of musical chairs, whoever’s standing up (or owning) when the music stops.. well, we know what happens.
pdmsero	692472401611898880	2016-01-27T22:21:00	JoMicheII You’re selling the ownership on the deposit to buy something, really, which can then be sold for all sorts of other things.
pdmsero	692472136879980544	2016-01-27T22:19:57	JoMicheII So if income constant over periods, you’ve just anticipated future consumption which you’ll have to reduce if gains unrealised.
pdmsero	692471841148002305	2016-01-27T22:18:47	JoMicheII Right, but you’re still relying on that future income stream to come good, otherwise you will have saved less than desired.
pdmsero	692471676085342209	2016-01-27T22:18:07	JoMicheII Very much so :)
pdmsero	692471354021535744	2016-01-27T22:16:50	JoMicheII Right, so hypothetically the total value of your asset holdings could stay constant if you chose to withdraw dxA from savings.

pdmsero	692470640541089793	2016-01-27T22:14:00	JoMicheII Sure, but that implies they’re selling of some other asset that they hold, which I was assuming away just to make it simple.
pdmsero	692470223476256768	2016-01-27T22:12:21	JoMicheII Right, but that must mean that the asset is sold and capital gains realised upon sale. Unrealised gains remain paper gains.
pdmsero	692469716829523968	2016-01-27T22:10:20	JoMicheII (…) and they don’t take out a loan, it’s hard to see how behaviour can change except for savings to increase.
pdmsero	692469552085598208	2016-01-27T22:09:41	JoMicheII If the individual purchased the asset at price P, then their income upon sale increases only by dxA. If they don’t sell (…)

pdmsero	692468975523987456	2016-01-27T22:07:23	JoMicheII Ok, this is already above my pay grade, but let’s consider the following hypothetical example:
pdmsero	692468314354876416	2016-01-27T22:04:46	JoMicheII You can, but unless they generate an income stream, these are just paper gains, you can’t use them for very much.
pdmsero	692467887093714950	2016-01-27T22:03:04	JoMicheII Sure, but you have to borrow it in some way, right? Not quite sure how to think about much of this.
pdmsero	692466248601505792	2016-01-27T21:56:33	JoMicheII (…) is or should be accounted for as income.
pdmsero	692466150190534656	2016-01-27T21:56:10	JoMicheII Yes, my mistake, wasn’t thinking about this straight, but clearly the difference between purchase and sale price of the asset (…)

pdmsero	692464960706854913	2016-01-27T21:51:26	JoMicheII (…) constraints, so I’d expected it to be relatively uncontroversial. Income though.. nah.
pdmsero	692464733153292288	2016-01-27T21:50:32	JoMicheII Seems fair enough, even in a completely conventional model, a change in the expected value of the asset will relax borrowing (…)
pdmsero	692464391523012609	2016-01-27T21:49:10	JoMicheII Clearly, many borrow against putative asset price gains, that’s absolutely not in dispute, but not best way to think of it, IMO.
pdmsero	692464166225973248	2016-01-27T21:48:17	JoMicheII Lectures and seminars taking up virtually all of my time, haven’t been able to engage as much in the past few weeks.
pdmsero	692463704370208770	2016-01-27T21:46:27	JoMicheII Strikes me as odd to classify as income today what is effectively a change in the expected future income stream of an asset.

pdmsero	689759897865555969	2016-01-20T10:42:29	s8mb Ha, fair, been busy with work and haven’t had the time to engage with all the great stuff you fine folks have been tweeting about.

pdmsero	680849726711926784	2015-12-26T20:36:39	Noahpinion Careful though, you can explain away virtually every single economic phenomenon by appealing to an exotic utility function.

pdmsero	679067576408760321	2015-12-21T22:35:01	PCMagalhaes Nothing’s too tasteless when it comes to commentary on European institutions, clearly.
pdmsero	679066684422881280	2015-12-21T22:31:28	PCMagalhaes Sold out to the bureaucrats from Brussels, clearly, won’t anyone in the UK press have the guts to write the truth about Europe?
pdmsero	679065605589176320	2015-12-21T22:27:11	I see The Telegraph has stopped worrying about a coup in Portugal and instead has its anti-EU screed machine in Spain mode now. Fun.
