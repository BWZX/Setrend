CapehartJ	715858878177652736	2016-04-01T11:10:31	Actually, he'd be raising money to help DNC/state parties boost house and senate races. (1/2) 
CapehartJ	715858545749655552	2016-04-01T11:09:11	I expect Sanders to change his tune on using DNC money just like he's done on Super Delegates. polsgonpol 
CapehartJ	715858336244178944	2016-04-01T11:08:22	Because if he becomes the nominee, which is still very possible, he will need that money.
