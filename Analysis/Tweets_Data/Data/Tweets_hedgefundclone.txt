hedgefundclone	725766044900560896	2016-04-28T19:18:03	The common theme with all of the worlds greatest billionaire investors is they're contrarian, skeptical, and opportunistic
hedgefundclone	725765501851455489	2016-04-28T19:15:54	Another practitioner of Variant Perception or (the market is always wrong) is Billionaire Michael Steinhardt who returned 32% annualized
hedgefundclone	725765184774672384	2016-04-28T19:14:38	So to really make big returns 30%-40% annualized think like the billionaires we follow at  Tepper, Soros and Buffett
hedgefundclone	725764770507460613	2016-04-28T19:13:00	CHK was the ultimate binary trade, the type of trades that Paulson, Tepper, Soros made to propel them to billionaires
hedgefundclone	725764529876008960	2016-04-28T19:12:02	BryanatLogic theorized like Tepper in 2009 that CHK was too big to fail, as the banks owned too much CHK debt and today CHK is $7
hedgefundclone	725763725576253440	2016-04-28T19:08:50	Just like CHK Chesapeake this year the market told u the stock in Feb at $1.50 was going bankrupt smart traders like BryanatLogic didn't
hedgefundclone	725763438186774530	2016-04-28T19:07:42	So take their advice do original research and don't follow news, options flow, but be opportunistic and look for mispricings and then pounce
hedgefundclone	725762898467913728	2016-04-28T19:05:33	So you have two of the best investors in the world Buffett and Soros who thinks the markets are not always right as well as David Tepper too
hedgefundclone	725762609182588928	2016-04-28T19:04:24	Buffett thinks the same way as Buffett once famously said "I'd be a bum on the street with a tin cup if the markets were always efficient"

hedgefundclone	725478116739670020	2016-04-28T00:13:56	So basically Paxton Lynch is the most overrated QB in the Draft and Cardale Jones most undervalued yet lynch is projected 1st Rnd. Jones 3rd

hedgefundclone	725471515538538496	2016-04-27T23:47:42	@CJ12_Cardale Jones is statistically the steal of the QB draft, he has the same physicals as 1st rounder Pax Lynch and he never lost a game
