GuyAdami	685623837833179136	2016-01-09T00:47:15	Got nothing to do with CNBC , it was the way I was raised 
GuyAdami	685623039644561408	2016-01-09T00:44:05	You don't like CNBC - that is fair. Personal attacks not so much.But if you are in the city, I would enjoy lunch! 
GuyAdami	685622633807908864	2016-01-09T00:42:28	Never have blocked or muted anyone - don't plan on it either  
GuyAdami	685622375027765248	2016-01-09T00:41:27	Perhaps, or maybe they get a better understanding of markets so they can ask intelligent questions to their advisors 
GuyAdami	685621920897855488	2016-01-09T00:39:38	Hopefully it wasn't anything I said to devolve it..  Appreciate your feedback - have a great weekend 
GuyAdami	685620269969440768	2016-01-09T00:33:05	Then you should have said that. Personal attacks aren't particularly cool though 
GuyAdami	685619995213197314	2016-01-09T00:31:59	Fair point sir. Appreciate your feedback.The only agenda we have is to try to share our market views and help people 
GuyAdami	685619564525260800	2016-01-09T00:30:17	David, I tried to be respectful. Pictures are not mean to sell anything. Sorry it isn't as professional as yours 
GuyAdami	685618944649080836	2016-01-09T00:27:49	creightonlaw77 and I respect your opinion Brian. I really do. Just trying to voice my thoughts. I have zero issue with you sir
GuyAdami	685618639492530177	2016-01-09T00:26:36	You lost me... but all good sir, picture is me speaking at a Georgetown event - the other is me and my son

GuyAdami	685616772825911297	2016-01-09T00:19:11	excuse me?  
GuyAdami	685616383934230529	2016-01-09T00:17:38	Brian, tonight's show upset you. My point again, after careful consideration BK made a call to try and warn people 
GuyAdami	685615656360886272	2016-01-09T00:14:45	jrltexas1 Thanks JR!
GuyAdami	685615309655519232	2016-01-09T00:13:22	Thank you sir! - guess my point was, didn't understand their interest in him at the start 
GuyAdami	685615084069076993	2016-01-09T00:12:28	We aren't attempting to influence behavior Brian. We are trying to voice opinions and let viewers make decisions 
GuyAdami	685614818607411200	2016-01-09T00:11:25	RSK. Brian is as well versed on markets as anyone, incredibly bright, and I take exception to you calling him a liar 
GuyAdami	685614084943933441	2016-01-09T00:08:30	The exact point BKBrianKelly made this evening 
GuyAdami	685613036787380225	2016-01-09T00:04:20	Well Ted, at least he has the onions and courage of his conviction to put it out there.  
GuyAdami	685612738362642432	2016-01-09T00:03:09	Didn't understand that signing at all..  
GuyAdami	685612615532441600	2016-01-09T00:02:40	Not to nitpick , but isn't fiction by definition imaginary? 
GuyAdami	685602651027968002	2016-01-08T23:23:04	GuyAdami creightonlaw77 and their attempts at supporting equities utter folly.
GuyAdami	685602750084808705	2016-01-08T23:23:28	GuyAdami and have a nice wee KEND.

GuyAdami	685601963610910721	2016-01-08T23:20:20	It's my assertion that they have lost control of their markets and their attempt at currency manipulation is culprit 
GuyAdami	685601597947260928	2016-01-08T23:18:53	No, irresponsible is feeling the way BKBrianKelly feels and NOT voicing that concern 
GuyAdami	685600984207327232	2016-01-08T23:16:27	Thank you for your feedback and your loyalty !! 
GuyAdami	685600138828603392	2016-01-08T23:13:05	But if he can save you from that 20% drop which he feels is imminent , isn't that responsible ? 
GuyAdami	685599732505440256	2016-01-08T23:11:28	Brian, fair point. For me, when China did that deval on August 11th, something changed.

GuyAdami	685585849656958976	2016-01-08T22:16:18	BKBrianKelly Great discussion on FM today, you're my hero! No one knows what will happen, but being in cash can't be the worst idea.

GuyAdami	685587205956497409	2016-01-08T22:21:42	GuyAdami BKBrianKelly is right. Nothing wrong with cash. Sitting through a 25% draw down (or worse) is the poorer option
GuyAdami	685586591071494145	2016-01-08T22:19:15	GuyAdami BKBrianKelly Thanks for telling it LikeItIs.  Protecting capital is the first rule of investing, no?
