LibertyBlitz	720698556722491392	2016-04-14T19:41:40	The major difference, I suppose, between science and economics, is that ultimately the truth usually prevails in science.

LibertyBlitz	698230862001864705	2016-02-12T19:43:04	We are starting to see this play out in the American political landscape: 
LibertyBlitz	698230344168960000	2016-02-12T19:41:01	This is how the Democratic Party does "democracy" 
LibertyBlitz	698229332351832064	2016-02-12T19:36:59	If Hillary wins nomination, I doubt we see Bloomberg. If Sanders wins, much more likely.
LibertyBlitz	698229232821002241	2016-02-12T19:36:36	The reason Michael Bloomberg would enter the race would be to protect Wall Street from Sanders: 
LibertyBlitz	698229065476603909	2016-02-12T19:35:56	LongShortTrader That I did not see. Interesting. Sanders seems to be the humane vessel for frustration vs. Trump.
LibertyBlitz	698228641688322049	2016-02-12T19:34:15	LongShortTrader Exactly right, because he is the only one saying "this system is a rigged fraud." Which it obviously is.
LibertyBlitz	698227941394747392	2016-02-12T19:31:28	LongShortTrader I think Americans believe in markets/entrepreneurship. They reject this fraud system. Sanders doing well in Silicon valley.
LibertyBlitz	698227647990665218	2016-02-12T19:30:18	LongShortTrader Then again these are just words right? What we have isn't really capitalism. It's a fraud system. That's what people reject
LibertyBlitz	698227391919996932	2016-02-12T19:29:17	LongShortTrader My optimism stems from the youth embracing Sanders far more than Trump.
LibertyBlitz	698227262005628928	2016-02-12T19:28:46	LongShortTrader Yes, but that's what all of the worst demagogues do. Read some of Hitler's speeches if you can.
LibertyBlitz	698227072737636353	2016-02-12T19:28:01	LongShortTrader Also agree. Hence my obvious leaning toward Sanders vs. Trump despite my issues with Sanders' economic statism.
LibertyBlitz	698226928591970304	2016-02-12T19:27:26	LongShortTrader I also agree with your optimism. This is what has to happen. Political awakening is underway. Shame Trump preaches hate.
LibertyBlitz	698226749210025987	2016-02-12T19:26:44	LongShortTrader Yep. This is the greatest political paradigm shift of our lives. Fourth Turning really heating up now.
LibertyBlitz	698226435098615808	2016-02-12T19:25:29	LongShortTrader I have issues with him as well, but hard to overstate importance of people like him calling out Hillary. He has influence.

LibertyBlitz	698223254100647936	2016-02-12T19:12:50	Kwikfit4uTim stacyherbert Then we are talking millions of lives and so it's worth making sure he beats her.
LibertyBlitz	698222640394342400	2016-02-12T19:10:24	Kwikfit4uTim stacyherbert In my opinion, Sanders wouldn't be marginally better than Clinton on foreign policy, he'd be 100x better.

LibertyBlitz	698209262858686464	2016-02-12T18:17:15	Wow, Sanders now looking tied with Clinton in Nevada.  
LibertyBlitz	698196324072558593	2016-02-12T17:25:50	I don't dislike Bloomberg because he's a billionaire. I dislike him because he's a massive authoritarian statist.
LibertyBlitz	698191060204294144	2016-02-12T17:04:55	This is what Hillary Clinton's dreams look like:

LibertyBlitz	698189258062827520	2016-02-12T16:57:45	As Managing Director at Goldman Sachs, Heidi Cruz should know about God's work:

LibertyBlitz	698185895686459392	2016-02-12T16:44:23	ciudadanos_ec stacyherbert Then start getting mad, as opposed to saying "Well, it's always been this way." BTW Ecuador is a lovely place.

LibertyBlitz	697545030550974465	2016-02-10T22:17:49	A lot of the problems we have in America today stem from perverse cultural aspirations. What we admire, look up to and try to emulate.

LibertyBlitz	688064888564920320	2016-01-15T18:27:07	What I mean is think about what is driving Sanders to run for President compared to everyone else. He's the only one without power lust.
