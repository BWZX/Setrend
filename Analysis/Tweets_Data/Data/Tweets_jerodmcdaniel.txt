jerodmcdaniel	720786418801319940	2016-04-15T01:30:48	Buy_Mortimer TheCattleDude I'd rather eat a 2.5 year old open heifer than a fat tubby 18 month old fed fat steer.  Leaner &amp; better tasting
jerodmcdaniel	720778365939023872	2016-04-15T00:58:48	JrodCreed so although it can be done relatively fast, the actual time spreads out over couple weeks for corn and another 3 weeks for Milo
jerodmcdaniel	720778160690757632	2016-04-15T00:57:59	JrodCreed killer is seed, fert, &amp; chem prep time &amp; spraying fields either pre or post planting, and starting wells/sprinklers
jerodmcdaniel	720777503028056064	2016-04-15T00:55:22	JrodCreed yep, I can plant my entire corn crop in about 55 hours of actual "running time", Milo probably takes me 65-70 hrs

jerodmcdaniel	720775583106334720	2016-04-15T00:47:45	Buy_Mortimer would organic fall under "branded"?
jerodmcdaniel	720774234960625668	2016-04-15T00:42:23	Would be perfect GFY to both packer &amp; specialty "holier than thou" producers.
jerodmcdaniel	720773881514987520	2016-04-15T00:40:59	Would be perfect irony, using the retail prices of the same product (organic &amp; regular beef) to close the rift in market between two...
jerodmcdaniel	720773606519627776	2016-04-15T00:39:53	Boom, just had another BrainStorm... When compiling the "Wal-Mart" index for beef, co-mingle organic and regular beef prices, boosting GMO!!

jerodmcdaniel	720772431422427136	2016-04-15T00:35:13	@entmtb data is out there, just nobody has figured out a way to gather it and I'm sure the retail isn't going to volunteer it to ranchers
jerodmcdaniel	720772140018962433	2016-04-15T00:34:04	@entmtb just thinking of random ways to collect data, but yea... Just give them coupons for beef specials, benefits both ways
jerodmcdaniel	720770926501974017	2016-04-15T00:29:14	jsbuyem *practical (not practice)
jerodmcdaniel	720770811225714689	2016-04-15T00:28:47	jsbuyem kinda think the most practice road is to force change on the current system rather than overhaul, reboot, and rebuild capacity
jerodmcdaniel	720770534187737088	2016-04-15T00:27:41	jsbuyem yep, most bigger cattle entities are all in a race to solve complete vert integrated riddle, pretty easy to do front end but back..
jerodmcdaniel	720770011074146305	2016-04-15T00:25:36	I'm sure that there is a current database of every beef retail price for major chains somewhere, could provide same info, a WalMart index
jerodmcdaniel	720769375230255104	2016-04-15T00:23:04	Easy way to mine metadata from the masses with today's technology &amp; avoid all the bullshit games currently going on with the current system
jerodmcdaniel	720768738228711424	2016-04-15T00:20:33	Would be very cheap data collection, so what if it costs you (app developer) $1k per week for data of retail prices...
jerodmcdaniel	720768365887787008	2016-04-15T00:19:04	Do this for enough time to develop a pricing model based upon REAL TIME consumer meat market... And now price fat cattle off of this model
jerodmcdaniel	720768092876328960	2016-04-15T00:17:59	Should develop an app where average Joe consumer can get like $1 a picture/week if he just snaps retail beef counter price...
jerodmcdaniel	720767401722191872	2016-04-15T00:15:14	Buy_Mortimer it would be so easy to fuck everyone at same time, also, I'll bet isn't even illegal  Probably pays "owner" a "consulting fee"
jerodmcdaniel	720766854722035713	2016-04-15T00:13:04	And I wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't collusion between packers, much like Aubrey McClendon and his buddies in Natty Gas
jerodmcdaniel	720766426651340800	2016-04-15T00:11:21	That's the danger with setting formula, grid, etc off cash market component.. If they screw the cash, they got ya in every other avenue too
jerodmcdaniel	720766185797627904	2016-04-15T00:10:24	Really wouldn't matter how much they lost or reimbursed the person feeding the cattle, they effectively stampeded the market lower by then
jerodmcdaniel	720765924744101889	2016-04-15T00:09:22	If they always had say 5 pens of cattle scattered across nation, and when needed to they could lob them like bombs at cash market....
jerodmcdaniel	720765652462542848	2016-04-15T00:08:17	Why wouldn't packers just keep a few "ringer" pens around under somebody else's name, just to take the low bid of cash offers?
jerodmcdaniel	720762615962558465	2016-04-14T23:56:13	If you wrongly believe buying "organic" benefits the environment, think again.  "Organic" grain shipped from Romania…

jerodmcdaniel	720084821813276672	2016-04-13T03:02:54	BartParks having cattle opens so many more options for me, make corn/Milo both dual purpose crops
jerodmcdaniel	720084346430828544	2016-04-13T03:01:01	BartParks without the Milo stalks, I might not have room for the extra cattle, and the margin in them is waaaaay better than Milo currently
jerodmcdaniel	720084052410171393	2016-04-13T02:59:51	BartParks if I can run another 50 pair because I've got another 1/2 section of milo stalks, adds about $100 acre to bottom line for 1/2 sec
jerodmcdaniel	720083339198107649	2016-04-13T02:57:01	BartParks plus there is residual value in the residue for me with cow/calf, that's a lot of extra roughage for them to eat at some point

jerodmcdaniel	720082714406232064	2016-04-13T02:54:32	jhansman because there are more buyers than sellers?
jerodmcdaniel	720082382594777088	2016-04-13T02:53:13	king_patrick12 I think most of us are tapped out on corn acres due to irrigation capacity, could maybe see Milo as it doesn't take as much
