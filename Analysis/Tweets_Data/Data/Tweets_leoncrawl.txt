leoncrawl	713019154748583936	2016-03-24T15:06:28	spollck upon reflection i think i should have addressed that in the post
leoncrawl	713019043641487360	2016-03-24T15:06:01	spollck the question of what is just from the victims' perspective is separate from the policy implications of a case like this &gt;
leoncrawl	713018888200527872	2016-03-24T15:05:24	spollck tbh i don’t know whether sending more cops to prison for these incidents will speed those along. maybe, maybe not
leoncrawl	713018701893787649	2016-03-24T15:04:40	spollck and it can become the default for more cops through new kinds of training + culture change &gt;&gt;
leoncrawl	713018312628764673	2016-03-24T15:03:07	spollck i think driving up to him was a conscious choice, yeah. the default should be “how do we diffuse this w/o endangering anyone” &gt;
leoncrawl	713008610398310401	2016-03-24T14:24:34	spollck (and i realize having his gun out w/ finger on trigger can count as fatal decision-making. but diff from deciding to shoot someone)
leoncrawl	713006178062712833	2016-03-24T14:14:54	spollck &gt;&gt; it’s those choices, i think, that we should be looking for ways to discourage. i suspect threat of jail time is one of them
leoncrawl	713006051637985280	2016-03-24T14:14:24	spollck …a distinction b/w liang, who killed by accident, and say, the guys who shot tamir rice, who made conscious tactical choices. &gt;&gt;
leoncrawl	713005906938740736	2016-03-24T14:13:49	spollck i do think threat of jailtime for fatal decision-making would incline cops to make those decisions less often! that’s why i make...
leoncrawl	713005667376828416	2016-03-24T14:12:52	spollck totally fair point, and i don’t have a great answer. it’s just true tho that these cases become stand-ins for bigger issues, right?
leoncrawl	713002740612513792	2016-03-24T14:01:14	spollck jailing a failure of a cop who accidentally killed someone wouldn’t achieve that. more key, to me: punishing fatal decision-making
leoncrawl	713002411657396224	2016-03-24T13:59:56	spollck i take yr point, but my view on police prosecutions is that they should achieve the goal of getting fewer people killed by cops
