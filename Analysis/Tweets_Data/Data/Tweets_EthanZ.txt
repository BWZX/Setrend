EthanZ	694204704293830659	2016-02-01T17:04:33	Of course, MassBroadband has just pulled funding from Wired_West, a project designed to help save us from the Verizon monopoly.
EthanZ	694204480976523266	2016-02-01T17:03:40	Also, MassDTC is aware how awful broadband is in western MA, encouraged me to look into MassBroadband institute for solutions to verizon
EthanZ	694204235068633089	2016-02-01T17:02:41	If my Verizon land line - which I no longer have - was not functioning, MassDTC could have leverage, but not on broadband

EthanZ	694203160815124481	2016-02-01T16:58:25	More amazing, perhaps, is verizon's policy that they do not refund you for unusable service UNTIL THE ISSUE IS RESOLVED.
EthanZ	694203014979141632	2016-02-01T16:57:51	What's amazing is that verizon will not even estimate when they might fix this issue.
EthanZ	694202935333523460	2016-02-01T16:57:32	The techs at verizon tell me that the switches at our local company office are overloaded, and are dropping 40-50% of everyone's packets
EthanZ	694202811689635844	2016-02-01T16:57:02	I spent almost two hours on the phone with verizon last night, in which they confirmed that packet loss is their problem, not mine
