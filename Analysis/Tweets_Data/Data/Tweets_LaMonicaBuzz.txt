LaMonicaBuzz	684474409239883776	2016-01-05T20:39:50	54. Okay. This is ridiculous. Even for me. The tweets need to get a bit shorter now.

LaMonicaBuzz	684472935697006596	2016-01-05T20:33:59	49. 1 million! Are you trying to kill me? That's the equivalent of nearly 7,143 tweets at the 140 character limit!

LaMonicaBuzz	684472005912096769	2016-01-05T20:30:17	46. I give up. I can't do it. 10,000 characters is a lot of bleeping characters. Here's hoping Twitter doesn't expand the limit after all be
LaMonicaBuzz	684471621407629313	2016-01-05T20:28:46	45. Is it time for another poll? Nah. But I might have to start using GIFs soon. Or emojis. 
LaMonicaBuzz	684471158893350912	2016-01-05T20:26:55	44. Very compelling idea. Twitter probably still looking to do more acquisitions. And Medium has the ev connection. 
LaMonicaBuzz	684470727433674753	2016-01-05T20:25:12	43. Thanks, SedulousCapital! Asked and answered. So I guess I'm not done yet. Sigh. And I'm sorry. Seriously. 
LaMonicaBuzz	684470309265764353	2016-01-05T20:23:33	42. I wonder how many characters I am at now. I haven't used full 140 every time. This is tweet 42. So probably somewhere around 5k mark.

LaMonicaBuzz	684467949722288128	2016-01-05T20:14:10	32. Agree again. For all the complaining about 140 characters being too short, it does force you to be disciplined.

LaMonicaBuzz	684466869282144256	2016-01-05T20:09:53	28. chuckle. It really does. Okay, time for another poll. Should Twitter expand to 10K characters or stick with 140?
