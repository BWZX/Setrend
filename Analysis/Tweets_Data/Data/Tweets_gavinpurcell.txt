gavinpurcell	705040725013106688	2016-03-02T14:43:02	5) What's to stop an enhanced AI -- at some point down the line -- from being able to simulate all (or nearly all) of the possible outcomes
gavinpurcell	705040544599244800	2016-03-02T14:42:19	4) This is already happening in a number of industries and we'll see more and more as we go along. So...
gavinpurcell	705040410826170368	2016-03-02T14:41:47	3) Once enhanced AI gets to a certain level, it will be able to begin to make predictions that will be more and more accurate.
