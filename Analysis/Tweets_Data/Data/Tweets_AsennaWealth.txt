AsennaWealth	718309198367428609	2016-04-08T05:27:13	PaulJSingh Lol, love the fine print.
AsennaWealth	718307893733408769	2016-04-08T05:22:02	l0ccy We use trailing stops to tell us that, your guess is as good as if not better than mine.
AsennaWealth	718293297559662592	2016-04-08T04:24:02	My inbox is absolutely flooded with deals. Likes like corporate arms at other firms have shut shop.
AsennaWealth	718289047853076480	2016-04-08T04:07:08	mrporter_1 Was just telling the boys Porter has the right idea by not being here.
AsennaWealth	718288525054099462	2016-04-08T04:05:04	AsennaWealth That's the markets way of saying be selective &amp; trade cautiously until the easy s returns and that's when you get wreckless.
AsennaWealth	718288284993105921	2016-04-08T04:04:06	Cant remember the last time I looked at a chart and thought buy or sell with 100% conviction.
AsennaWealth	718265059428954112	2016-04-08T02:31:49	Open an Etrade or CMCMarketsANZ account with Asenna. Reply YES to our SMS alerts and have an Asenna trader place the trade on your behalf.
AsennaWealth	718256750827323392	2016-04-08T01:58:48	JPaine321 SpecVestASX All up including corporate we are 9 people. Very small firm that's growing quickly.

AsennaWealth	718253684430385152	2016-04-08T01:46:37	SpecVestASX Our analyst is meeting them today.
AsennaWealth	718252030641508356	2016-04-08T01:40:03	rhodgardner lol. Best response so far.
AsennaWealth	718251866002427908	2016-04-08T01:39:23	rhodgardner Like I said won't do anything until Q1 next year.
AsennaWealth	718246836549656577	2016-04-08T01:19:24	If you trade with the monentum this game becomes so much more forgiving.
AsennaWealth	718246696292126720	2016-04-08T01:18:51	When something is trending down it tends to be followed by bad news and as a result gap down. Why expose yourself to this scenario?
AsennaWealth	718244301659119617	2016-04-08T01:09:20	You might miss 10% in reward by waiting for a trend reversal signal but risk is reduced by 90%.
AsennaWealth	718244124839788546	2016-04-08T01:08:38	Markets discount fut, sometimes they're wrong and these opportunities present value. Wait for a trend reversal &amp; decrease risk dramatically.
AsennaWealth	718243639806332928	2016-04-08T01:06:42	Banks cheap on last yrs earnings but markets discount the fut, they're falling for a reason. Wether that reason plays out is another story.
AsennaWealth	718243070978953217	2016-04-08T01:04:27	ANZ 22.13 longterm trendline comes in at $16. Similar scenario to when BHP was at mid 20s last year. ASX

AsennaWealth	718153497602953217	2016-04-07T19:08:31	GetAHedge This is early days on this move. If the trade plays out this is the start of the beggining of a 6 month hold.
AsennaWealth	718153145285611520	2016-04-07T19:07:07	GetAHedge Read the thread.

AsennaWealth	718150524919422976	2016-04-07T18:56:42	77Virgil Same thing. Figured RUT would struggle more at recent highs and that would eliminate whip and I was right. It played out that way.
AsennaWealth	718149985309630464	2016-04-07T18:54:33	vivekBWT Read the thread.
AsennaWealth	718145929119817728	2016-04-07T18:38:26	77Virgil I live 5min from the office.

AsennaWealth	718141740394262528	2016-04-07T18:21:47	AsennaWealth The same 6 talking heads that called crash on SPX 1820 neckline went super bullish on NFP. You can't teach that shite.
AsennaWealth	718047088857100289	2016-04-07T12:05:41	HiddenPivots Yep. Tweet said stop in new highs.
AsennaWealth	718040892519489536	2016-04-07T11:41:03	tradergav They think what I do is boring. They asked if I was a weather man. 😂
AsennaWealth	718040648738189312	2016-04-07T11:40:05	RobertSerkas and it will happen many more times. The alternative is to wait for the breakout.
AsennaWealth	718039876386488320	2016-04-07T11:37:01	pactrades1 lol at the profile pic and Thanks.

AsennaWealth	718032802126532608	2016-04-07T11:08:55	Cate_L_ Yep, because we trade breaks and have 100s of alerts the number of alerts tends to increase before major moves. It's a huge tell.
AsennaWealth	718029861378330626	2016-04-07T10:57:13	Cate_L_ Both, auditory and a buy box pops up on the screen.
AsennaWealth	718028970424279040	2016-04-07T10:53:41	JLTrader1 Rayner_Teo Read his book trading commodity futures and chart patterns.

AsennaWealth	718001155029073920	2016-04-07T09:03:09	TheATrader That's standard.
AsennaWealth	718000987055611904	2016-04-07T09:02:29	Barnsty72 I've boarded the windows and bought a couple of guns.😂
AsennaWealth	718000167014674438	2016-04-07T08:59:14	Longer the range, more sustainable the BO. You'd be suprised how many traders don't use alerts. Bf alerts there were days I wouldn't blink.
AsennaWealth	717998526676869120	2016-04-07T08:52:43	Waiting months for the big move tends to lead to impatience but as soon as you give up on the trade, that's when it generally happens.
AsennaWealth	717994574753300480	2016-04-07T08:37:00	ZefiCLo I was lucky in that I turned $50k into $480k in the 1999 dotcom boom and I didn't even know what I was doing. 😊
AsennaWealth	717992945379479552	2016-04-07T08:30:32	ZefiCLo We look to catch major moves in the direction of the trend. Pretty simple.
AsennaWealth	717992811732160512	2016-04-07T08:30:00	ZefiCLo Mainly medium term position trading on the breaks. Big on letting winners ride.

AsennaWealth	717923600787853314	2016-04-07T03:54:59	When something goes parabolic common sense says tighten trailer &amp; more often than not u will sell into the reversal bar. Play probability.
AsennaWealth	717922715764535296	2016-04-07T03:51:28	Most bottom end management misinform but what insiders do with their money (money flow) never lies. Follow the money flow, trading 101.
AsennaWealth	717921807009878018	2016-04-07T03:47:51	$88E a great eg of why u should follow money flow, we advised clients to sell TL breach at 7.1 2 days back, last 4. Money flow NEVER lies!

AsennaWealth	717675515084087297	2016-04-06T11:29:11	Don't confuse "breaking the law" with "wanting the laws changed". The blur that is an emotional topic.

AsennaWealth	713529552350253056	2016-03-26T00:54:36	Since opening Asenna &amp; watching clients trade the biggest error breakout traders make is lack of patience. Too aggressive on low prob BOs.
AsennaWealth	713528842120355843	2016-03-26T00:51:47	More often than not the larger the spike the longer it will take the base to form bc time needs to catch up with price.
AsennaWealth	713528597886013441	2016-03-26T00:50:49	The shorter flag breaks tend to retrace, retest or fail bc ST traders r still active. Longer bases flush ST traders bc they are impatient.
AsennaWealth	713527636388028416	2016-03-26T00:46:59	Look for stocks breaking from LT range. Longer &amp; tigher the base, more reliable the break will follow thru. Thats when you put on xtra risk.
AsennaWealth	713526384195317761	2016-03-26T00:42:01	Choppy markets are the kind of markets that chew traders up and spit them out in bulk. Make a conscious effort to avoid this scenario.
AsennaWealth	713525859550760960	2016-03-26T00:39:56	Look to take major move breaks, they tend to follow through. Prevention is the best cure. ALWAYS stay in control.

AsennaWealth	705982856783212544	2016-03-05T05:06:44	JordanEliseo We went 1 FOMC too early on gold. We are always too early, need to allow for that in future.
AsennaWealth	705981906773356545	2016-03-05T05:02:57	JordanEliseo Anyway gold in AUD should be fine bc if it plays out that way, AUD will sell off as money rushes back to USD safe havens.

AsennaWealth	705980946714001409	2016-03-05T04:59:08	JordanEliseo The question is when the global market really let go will gold sell off like it did during GFC on the rush to liquidity?
AsennaWealth	705980669931859973	2016-03-05T04:58:02	JordanEliseo Spot on. One of the markets is wrong and I'll be betting that it's not gold very soon.
AsennaWealth	705979845948248064	2016-03-05T04:54:46	JordanEliseo Technically looks super bullish but needs a healthy short term breather.
AsennaWealth	705979336742973440	2016-03-05T04:52:44	JordanEliseo Fact gold didn't retrace on strong NFP is a bullish tell, even after taking into consideration low wage growth. Decoupling
