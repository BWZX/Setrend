bbcnickrobinson	700811605597102081	2016-02-19T22:38:01	Gove outed as outer by Number 10 as deal unveiled thus limiting impact of his announcement
bbcnickrobinson	700811108920201216	2016-02-19T22:36:03	"Michael Gove is one of my oldest &amp; closest friends. He's wanted to pull out of EU for 30 years. I'm disappointed but not surprised" says PM

bbcnickrobinson	700800468142972928	2016-02-19T21:53:46	Not "special" enough to persuade many in his own party. Will it be enough to persuade the country?

bbcnickrobinson	700703216804057088	2016-02-19T15:27:19	Not in Brussels &amp; no inside track but talk of need for EU leaders to book hotel rooms probably designed to put pressure on them to do a deal
bbcnickrobinson	700702874913771520	2016-02-19T15:25:58	First EU Summit cancelled "English breakfast" then brunch then lunch. Now deal to be done over "dinner". Whatever happened to "tea"?!
