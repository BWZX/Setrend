RajaKorman	712645419025702912	2016-03-23T14:21:22	FinanceCam Agree but IMO divide on "letting people die in the street": free trade &amp; neo-con forpol (partly Cruz) reflects class split too.

RajaKorman	712640417582477312	2016-03-23T14:01:30	FinanceCam @MacroYoungsta my rule--anyone who uses the word devaluation when depreciation suffices is probably a bowtied nutter anyway.
RajaKorman	712638948816920576	2016-03-23T13:55:40	FinanceCam @MacroYoungsta and once past the excitement, USDCNY becomes more of a Fed call, and given weight of CN in TWI, thats iterative
RajaKorman	712638557437997063	2016-03-23T13:54:06	FinanceCam @MacroYoungsta yes. strong view that weaker CNY worse for RoW than for China given tradeable sector size and largely LC debt.

RajaKorman	712636758354165760	2016-03-23T13:46:57	@MacroYoungsta they squeezed offshore specs hard via CNH rates gambling it wouldn't spill into onshore CNY rates. It worked.
RajaKorman	712636444616081409	2016-03-23T13:45:43	@MacroYoungsta the strategy of pushing CNY/CNH reconvergence via Shibor/Hibor deconvergence appears to have been a success (and then some).
