srubenfeld	716095095716646912	2016-04-02T02:49:09	sadistaction anntieup I like how he's played this season more than any other so far with him as a Knick. Griffin needs a PG more than Melo
srubenfeld	716094552063537152	2016-04-02T02:47:00	sadistaction anntieup which is why I don't think it will happen! Melo for Griffin, straight up, is an intriguing trade, though
srubenfeld	716093770190684160	2016-04-02T02:43:53	sadistaction anntieup idk if Pierce would stay. But a lot would have to   happen for it to occur. Melo has a no-trade clause, for example
srubenfeld	716092992545755136	2016-04-02T02:40:48	anntieup sadistaction yeah nah, I don't see it happening. It's LeBron being cryptic; if he went anywhere, it'd be LA (Paul/Wade/Bron/Melo)
