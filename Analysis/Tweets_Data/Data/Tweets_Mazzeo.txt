Mazzeo	684427063676268545	2016-01-05T17:31:42	bentossell try this - for every person who follows you, msg them then FaceTime. Best way to feel humanity behind "social" I've seen yet
Mazzeo	684426438204874752	2016-01-05T17:29:13	bjp assumptions will kill me

Mazzeo	684425742147547136	2016-01-05T17:26:27	👻 yesterday: FaceTime w Matt (HS principal), Stefan (9th grade hacker), thatguyBG (Goog Corp Dev) and bjp (👻 eng)

Mazzeo	684165443158818816	2016-01-05T00:12:07	SoroushG_ blab not or...AND. Snap has been even more intimate tho
Mazzeo	684165280918966274	2016-01-05T00:11:28	DaisyQin Snapchat feels like early days of most great social platforms where meeting new ppl possible / safe / fun... Even at this scale

Mazzeo	684113453569585154	2016-01-04T20:45:32	JoshDance it's a feature in the chat line... When both people present it turns blue and you can instantly FaceTime
Mazzeo	684112133198446592	2016-01-04T20:40:17	Snapchat = mmazzeo. Stories are awesome but also enjoying back/forth chat with new people. Anyone else playing with the FaceTime feature?

Mazzeo	683731697377001472	2016-01-03T19:28:34	jacksondahl tanayj sarahtavel djkhaled but no stats let's people start without feeling like they missed boat. Will help with celebs soon
Mazzeo	683727029812871168	2016-01-03T19:10:01	tanayj sarahtavel djkhaled lets people feel more comfortable with experimenting &amp; they clearly didn't need the extra juice for growth
Mazzeo	683726260946636801	2016-01-03T19:06:58	tanayj sarahtavel djkhaled actually think this is huge 🔑 over long term. Stats drove early adoption for most social, but snap hides
Mazzeo	683725116442714112	2016-01-03T19:02:25	scottbelsky sarahtavel they own all the picks and shovels AND they are the goldmine.
Mazzeo	683724850196709376	2016-01-03T19:01:21	scottbelsky sarahtavel they want you to look filtered/create better content, as long as you have to buy it from them
Mazzeo	683724451611987968	2016-01-03T18:59:46	scottbelsky sarahtavel I'm more interested in watching snapchat capture all tools of production as monetizable events...
Mazzeo	683723662004895744	2016-01-03T18:56:38	sarahtavel djkhaled snapchat: mmazzeo🔑🔑
Mazzeo	683723327551098880	2016-01-03T18:55:18	Peiman5 sarahtavel djkhaled I'd argue now has more to do with ease of capture/where he is seeing growth/the kind of formats that work
Mazzeo	683722797474959360	2016-01-03T18:53:12	sarahtavel djkhaled quality on snapchat will be perceived authenticity but will still be produced... Like bloggers on YT became over time
Mazzeo	683722630029901824	2016-01-03T18:52:32	sarahtavel djkhaled Now that race for followers heating up in earnest, race to "quality" as well, esp. w/ stories.
Mazzeo	683721728896270336	2016-01-03T18:48:57	sarahtavel djkhaled ephem was definitely initial driver for quality lowering, but not that volume of views are there, way more "retakes"
Mazzeo	683721321293856768	2016-01-03T18:47:20	sarahtavel when you get 3M view/24hrs like djkhaled or even 100 views/24 hours from people you care abt, you start caring abt quality
Mazzeo	683720116266115072	2016-01-03T18:42:33	sarahtavel that quality bar for stories rising so damn fast. Ephemerality is a bigger lever on velocity of views than quality bar lowering
