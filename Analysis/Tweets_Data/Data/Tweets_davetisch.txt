davetisch	670283843576963072	2015-11-27T16:51:36	paulcanetti thanks Paul, the apple file system isn't an issue? Do I save a separate copy on Dropbox for Google to work right?
davetisch	670283699439693825	2015-11-27T16:51:01	j0rdanfox awesome, super helpful. And the apple file system (everything stored in library) doesn't mess this all up?
davetisch	670280057827540993	2015-11-27T16:36:33	iamnader what a messâ€¦ thanks Nader
davetisch	670279729140908032	2015-11-27T16:35:15	iamnader but google lacks the user friendly stuff Apple has - and I'm apple all the way through, so lacks integrations into phone etc
davetisch	670279629974949889	2015-11-27T16:34:51	iamnader seems like there is no winner, just some better features on eachâ€¦ I'm scared of the apple file system (Library thing)â€¦
davetisch	670274967586623488	2015-11-27T16:16:20	Photo Management - Apple Photo v Google Photo - anyone do a deep dive on both and pick a winner - please adviseâ€¦
davetisch	669925215523180546	2015-11-26T17:06:32	real_hugo_boss spring sorry about that, will have our SpringConcierge look into this...
