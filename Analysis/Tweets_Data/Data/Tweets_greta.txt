greta	707306900522737664	2016-03-08T20:48:00	I agree-but some of the problems were not weather (broken seats delayed us)-feel bad for other passengers 
greta	707306642782736384	2016-03-08T20:46:59	Mine was weather - but the wifi not work so passengers could not connect to tell people on ground why late etc. 
greta	707306147452198914	2016-03-08T20:45:01	Next flight out for one passenger is tomorrow - AmericanAir needs to find a gate and hold the others
greta	707305836285202432	2016-03-08T20:43:47	. AmericanAir should hold the connecting flights for those on this flight who are connecting since AA can't find a gate to park this plane
greta	707305607049703424	2016-03-08T20:42:52	I feel bad for the passengers who are trying to connect to other flights AmericanAir - I am lucky,this is my destination
