RichardA	703162924156596224	2016-02-26T10:21:19	nickhassey it's not a measure of attainment though. The problem may be the unusual case of a high stakes test (GCSEs) at 15/16.

RichardA	703133545275879424	2016-02-26T08:24:35	HeatherBellaF ProfCoe I take your point. Although the research found quite wide variations by subjects 
RichardA	703133161862004737	2016-02-26T08:23:04	Eastreadingcom spsmith45 good point: is it value for money? Probably not.

RichardA	703131911498002432	2016-02-26T08:18:05	HeatherBellaF ProfCoe in which case we can't say for sure either way?
RichardA	703130456582000641	2016-02-26T08:12:19	HeatherBellaF no, ProfCoe says teacher quality doesn't account for the gap.
RichardA	703130026766499840	2016-02-26T08:10:36	WBickfordSmith matthewhood steveadcock81 so unadjusted there's a gap of 2 GCSE grades; adjusted for deprivation etc gap falls to .6
RichardA	703129790807568384	2016-02-26T08:09:40	WBickfordSmith matthewhood steveadcock81 interesting point. But even among middle class kids the gap appears according to Durham.

RichardA	702788523007610880	2016-02-25T09:33:35	oldandrewuk yes that a valid objection. The full paper is here: 
RichardA	702785364608602112	2016-02-25T09:21:02	RichardA I think people really want there to be a single cardinal measure of "maths" &amp; can't handle it that there isn't one
RichardA	702786639932858368	2016-02-25T09:26:06	oldandrewuk eg girls in London doing worse in maths under Pisa than they do in GCSEs (compared with girls elsewhere in England)
RichardA	702786208288608256	2016-02-25T09:24:23	oldandrewuk guardian so the mystery is why certain subsets do worse under one measure than another, within England.
RichardA	702785195599142912	2016-02-25T09:20:22	mikercameron so I see.
RichardA	702784737417568256	2016-02-25T09:18:33	dsquareddigest true. The issue here is relative performance rather than attainment.
RichardA	702781412215283712	2016-02-25T09:05:20	Responses so far: teachers in London teach to the test at GCSEs better; Pisa is rubbish; GCSEs are rubbish; all tests are rubbish.
RichardA	702780267149316096	2016-02-25T09:00:47	AndrewSabisky nickhassey not in the hearing of London teachers anyway 😬
RichardA	702779926093688832	2016-02-25T08:59:26	colinsparkbridg that's a valid argument.
RichardA	702778985869152257	2016-02-25T08:55:41	AndrewSabisky nickhassey if London teachers were good at teaching to both GCSEs and A levels? I guess although Occam's razor looms.
RichardA	702778561262952448	2016-02-25T08:54:00	PaulGarvey4 AndrewSabisky  that's another possibility.
RichardA	702777784700166144	2016-02-25T08:50:55	nickhassey let me know what you think if you read the full paper.
RichardA	702777218464923648	2016-02-25T08:48:40	nickhassey yes a mystery. I see St Andreas of OECD has pronounced this work to be in error.
RichardA	702776535565144064	2016-02-25T08:45:57	AndrewSabisky well that's a possible explanation, at least.
RichardA	702775093945040896	2016-02-25T08:40:13	colinsparkbridg that may be true but that's not the point here unless you are saying the Pisa test or better or worse than GCSEs somehow
RichardA	702774826503692288	2016-02-25T08:39:10	nickhassey ok. But why would it only impact girls in London?

RichardA	685011954533011456	2016-01-07T08:15:51	So an article claiming "there is no poverty in Britain" became "no poverty in New Zealand". Awesome.

RichardA	684874213337989120	2016-01-06T23:08:31	EquitableEd you're right - not sure how that happened.
