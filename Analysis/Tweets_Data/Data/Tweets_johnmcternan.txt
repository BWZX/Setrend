johnmcternan	721005713951035392	2016-04-15T16:02:12	cshirky johnmcternan very good analysis
johnmcternan	721005274262278144	2016-04-15T16:00:27	.cshirky is writing one of his magnificent Twitter essays at the moment. Do not miss it.
johnmcternan	720993773375754240	2016-04-15T15:14:45	Imagining a mostly-white path to the Democratic nomination was never a good idea. Let's hope we're witnessing the last time anyone tries it.
johnmcternan	720993491619172352	2016-04-15T15:13:38	The glory of the Democratic party in 2016 is that it looks like America ca. 2046. They've figured out how run in the country we're becoming.
johnmcternan	720993354285056000	2016-04-15T15:13:05	The Democrats have now won the popular vote 5 times in the 6 elections since 1992. (Gore got more votes than Bush in 2000.)
johnmcternan	720993226274922500	2016-04-15T15:12:35	But it's not the 20C any more, and the Democrats have figured out how to win elections, even with 60% of whites consistently against them.
johnmcternan	720993038764417024	2016-04-15T15:11:50	White abandonment, especially by Southerners, cost the Democratic party 5 out of the 6 presidential elections between 1968 and 1988.
johnmcternan	720992925669142529	2016-04-15T15:11:23	If it was still the 20C, targeting mostly white voters might have been a winning strategy, as the loss of those voters was such a blow.
johnmcternan	720992735356788737	2016-04-15T15:10:38	White liberals should be *really wary* about holding any conviction that requires us to close our ears when black people are talking.
johnmcternan	720992596982632449	2016-04-15T15:10:05	Sanders' assertion that black voters would be persuaded "once they get to know me" was obtuse and futile, and worse, it was ethically weak.
johnmcternan	720992433866039296	2016-04-15T15:09:26	It's almost as if black citizens have a different experience of life in America than whites.
johnmcternan	720992321618051073	2016-04-15T15:08:59	Asked if they expect their family finances to improve or worsen in the next 6 months, only 20% of whites say Improve. 60% of blacks do.
johnmcternan	720992205838528512	2016-04-15T15:08:31	Black citizens are twice as likely to say 'the country is headed in the right direction' as whites are.  
johnmcternan	720992089777901568	2016-04-15T15:08:04	All that 'Deep South' theorizing runs aground on this fact: black citizens approve of the President, and want a continuation of his policies
johnmcternan	720991946567626753	2016-04-15T15:07:30	Here's how: Sanders voters, mostly white, are broadly disappointed with Obama. Black voters do not share that sentiment. (To put it mildly.)
johnmcternan	720991841923936260	2016-04-15T15:07:05	This led to much bafflement, especially among young progressives. How could black citizens *not* want the revolution Sanders is selling?
johnmcternan	720990320662425601	2016-04-15T15:01:02	Even now, the biggest disagreement in policy preferences between working class whites &amp; Dems remains 'Aid to Blacks' 
johnmcternan	720990057004273665	2016-04-15T14:59:59	And in every election since 1964, a majority of whites opted for the party telling them white people are special, but minimum wage is a trap
