NateSilver538	726125846315077632	2016-04-29T19:07:47	We'll see if this changes, but so far Trump has been backed by has-beens and never-weres. Not candidates who have something on the line.
NateSilver538	726123431901671428	2016-04-29T18:58:11	Of 47 Republicans in competitive re-election races, only 1 (Tom Reed of NY-23) has backed Trump.

NateSilver538	726056285615988736	2016-04-29T14:31:22	Here's an important question. If Trump is nominated and loses substantially to Clinton, who are the leading GOP contenders for 2020?
NateSilver538	726049333271908353	2016-04-29T14:03:45	To me, the story is more about the impotence and/or incompetence of the GOP "establishment" rather than their embrace of Trump.
NateSilver538	726047855421485056	2016-04-29T13:57:52	Cruz doesn't have many endorsements either, although 2x more than Trump. Kasich, despite being "establishment lane", has no more than Trump.
NateSilver538	726046866027081728	2016-04-29T13:53:56	Worth remembering that Trump has only a smattering of endorsements. Usually a frontrunner has 100s at this point.

NateSilver538	722608061043646464	2016-04-20T02:09:21	After NY, to win pledged delegate majority, Bernie will need to win CA by ~20% and states like PA and NJ by ~10%. 
NateSilver538	722602832650768384	2016-04-20T01:48:35	Know that the GOP race has often contradicted momentum, but his results in NY also make a yuge 4/26 more plasubible. 
NateSilver538	722571765294215169	2016-04-19T23:45:08	Here's a detailed look at how a win or loss tonight would change Bernie's delegate math going forward.

NateSilver538	722502446610792448	2016-04-19T19:09:41	What we're watching for in today's New York primaries:  
NateSilver538	722458748720128000	2016-04-19T16:16:02	Not basing this on national polls, which are kind of dumb, but Sanders has improved relative to demographic benchmarks.
NateSilver538	722458358184288258	2016-04-19T16:14:29	Some caveats here, but looks to me like Sanders really has gained ground on Clinton.

NateSilver538	722133478020669440	2016-04-18T18:43:32	Introducing our new weekly column, Conventional Wisdom! This week: Cruz Romps In Wyoming Delegate Fight 
NateSilver538	721854845020422144	2016-04-18T00:16:21	FHQ: Thanks as always...
NateSilver538	721853793017667584	2016-04-18T00:12:10	FHQ: So the presidential preference vote in WV is basically a beauty contest?
NateSilver538	721851487773671429	2016-04-18T00:03:00	FHQ: So the three RNC delegates from West Virginia are unbound? Seeing contradictory info on this.
NateSilver538	721548201199853568	2016-04-17T03:57:51	Uhh sorry to break this to y'all but Hillary has 2.4 million more votes than Bernie.  
NateSilver538	721441990290849796	2016-04-16T20:55:48	Hard to defend the GOP's delegate rules varying so much from state to state. But tells you that real power lies with state parties, not RNC.
NateSilver538	721440344747937794	2016-04-16T20:49:16	I knew West Virginia's delegate rules were crazy but I didn't know they were *this* crazy.  
NateSilver538	721118983588548608	2016-04-15T23:32:18	Caucuses have mostly been in good states for Bernie, but data suggests he'd lose a net 50-100 delegates if they held primaries instead.
NateSilver538	721117322774192128	2016-04-15T23:25:42	Also worth remembering that Sanders is up a net 150 delegates from caucuses, which can disenfranchise voters. Clinton +370 in primaries.
NateSilver538	721107254204841984	2016-04-15T22:45:41	Iowa and New Hampshire rank as the 44th and 46th most represenative states of the Democratic coalition nationally. 
NateSilver538	721105881102946306	2016-04-15T22:40:14	Here are states whose demographics best match Democrats as a whole. Clinton may sweep all 8.  
NateSilver538	721105008788443137	2016-04-15T22:36:46	"The South" is way more representative of the Democratic Party than the places Sanders is winning. 
NateSilver538	721087145935572999	2016-04-15T21:25:47	Trump is just barely over 50%, but safer than you might think to stay at 50%+ because that average doesn't include any undecided voters.
NateSilver538	721086908529569792	2016-04-15T21:24:50	NY poll average: Trump 52.1 Kasich 23.0 Cruz 16.6

NateSilver538	720484935086305281	2016-04-14T05:32:49	Clear that Kobe's unselfishness hurt the Lakers, who went 16-65 this year in games where he took fewer than 50 shots.
NateSilver538	720475934063783938	2016-04-14T04:57:03	Correction: Kobe first player since 1983-84 to have 50+ field goal attempts in a game. Not all-time record. 
NateSilver538	720474668369649666	2016-04-14T04:52:01	Always Be Kobe-ing
NateSilver538	720469093363621889	2016-04-14T04:29:52	So basically, Steph has a chance to take away an all-time record from Kobe on Kobe's retirement night.
NateSilver538	720468371914010626	2016-04-14T04:27:00	Single-game 3PT record is 12, originally set by Kobe (since tied by Donyell Marshall and Steph Curry). Steph has 10 threes thru 3 quarters.
NateSilver538	720450950784237570	2016-04-14T03:17:46	Could Eli Manning have a farewell tour if he desperately wanted one? Joe Mauer? Carmelo Anthony? Zdeno Chara?
NateSilver538	720445603508068352	2016-04-14T02:56:31	What's the threshold for having a farewell tour? If Kevin Love wanted a farewell tour in 10 years would people be like uhhh sorry dude?

NateSilver538	720412491755335682	2016-04-14T00:44:57	This is the opposite of good journalism --&gt; 
NateSilver538	720404450192437248	2016-04-14T00:13:00	Clinton's largest net delegate advantage over Sanders comes from Texas &amp; Florida. Both are Southern but also incredibly diverse.
NateSilver538	720401111262359552	2016-04-13T23:59:43	You want states that are representative of the Democratic electorate? Ones on 3/15 (OH, FL, IL, NC, MO) are pretty good. Sanders 0 for 5.
NateSilver538	720400296443129857	2016-04-13T23:56:29	If the order of states matters, and it probably doesn't much in a 2-candidate race, Sanders was very lucky that IA and NH went first.
NateSilver538	720372446814015492	2016-04-13T22:05:49	Overlooked detail that may help Trump: many of the 54 uncommitted delegates in PA say they'll vote for state winner. 
NateSilver538	720326823884627968	2016-04-13T19:04:32	FWIW - lots of disagreement about this - I'm on the side that says we don't know very much about how Trump will do in super blue districts.
NateSilver538	720326219477024768	2016-04-13T19:02:08	By contrast, CA is basically 53 microprimaries. We have no good idea what will happen there.  
NateSilver538	720325841247338496	2016-04-13T19:00:38	In some ways NY is a snoozer. Trump will do great and probably finish with somewhere between 75-90 delegates. Not a huge range.
NateSilver538	720324761910251520	2016-04-13T18:56:20	1160 assumes that Trump: - Cleans up in the Northeast - Narrowly loses Indiana - Gets about half of Calif. delegates 
NateSilver538	720324382451609601	2016-04-13T18:54:50	My best guess is that Trump finishes with ~1160 delegates but there's a lot of uncertainty around that number. 1237 not impossible.
NateSilver538	720323619658670080	2016-04-13T18:51:48	Here's our epic, state-by-state roadmap to the rest of the Republican race:

NateSilver538	719692055262400512	2016-04-12T01:02:11	Out of New York, Maryland, Connecticut, Pennsylvania &amp; Delaware, Kasich probably needs to pick 2. Otherwise spread too thin and gets zippo.
NateSilver538	719691416511909888	2016-04-12T00:59:39	It's not that the Kasich campaign has a bad strategy. More that it doesn't have *any* strategy. 
NateSilver538	719657165535850497	2016-04-11T22:43:33	Okay, the new FiveThirtyEight elections pod is here. Trump's lousy ground game; "qualified"; and Harry's History

NateSilver538	719618267933995008	2016-04-11T20:08:59	Massive changes in Chicago policing &amp; crime statistics since Laquan McDonald video released.  
NateSilver538	719614548936933380	2016-04-11T19:54:12	mattdpearce: For sure. It's been a spectacularly interesting campaign...
NateSilver538	719612580487131137	2016-04-11T19:46:23	mattdpearce: I think that piece holds up quite well tbh especially compared to the conventional wisdom at the time. 
NateSilver538	719574174407258113	2016-04-11T17:13:46	We've got a good profile up today of deray's mayoral bid in Baltimore --&gt; 
NateSilver538	719566561753829376	2016-04-11T16:43:31	Here, at the Appalachian Market on US 9, is exactly where Upstate New York begins IMO.  
NateSilver538	719358783835762688	2016-04-11T02:57:53	By contrast, if GOP nomination were contested under Democratic rules -- proportional, with many superdelegates -- Trump would be toast. 5/
NateSilver538	719358562745610240	2016-04-11T02:57:01	But the *letter* of GOP's rules are haphazardly written, such that Trump might get 51% of the delegates with only 35-40% of the vote. 4/
NateSilver538	719358388145102848	2016-04-11T02:56:19	And in spirit, the rules are supposed to discourage factional, media-driven candidates like Trump who alienate half their party's voters. 3/
NateSilver538	719358191012835328	2016-04-11T02:55:32	It's hard to be a consensus candidate -- ask Marco Rubio -- but the spirit of the GOP rules are supposed to encourage consensus. 2/
NateSilver538	719358010548756481	2016-04-11T02:54:49	Thing is, Trump has exploited oddities of the Republican nomination rules more than he's been exploited by them. 1/

NateSilver538	719286379981746177	2016-04-10T22:10:11	Spieth successfully following Marco Rubio's 3-4-4-3-4-5-6-7-6-5-1-2 plan.  
NateSilver538	719236828600147968	2016-04-10T18:53:17	Not only is New York a closed primary -- it's super closed. Deadline for switching party registration was in *October*.
NateSilver538	719236376248610816	2016-04-10T18:51:29	In Wisconsin, Clinton tied Sanders among Democrats despite being blown out overall. And NY demographics much better for Clinton than WI.
NateSilver538	719235928225619969	2016-04-10T18:49:42	Ordinarily, I'd be skeptical of polls showing Clinton with a ~15% lead over Sanders in New York, but the closed primary thing is a big deal.
NateSilver538	719213848335630336	2016-04-10T17:21:58	Technically Rubio has gained delegates on Kasich since 3/15 because the Alaska GOP restored his delegates to him. 
NateSilver538	718982362097254401	2016-04-10T02:02:07	It's a sweep --&gt; Cruz gets 13 of 13 at-large delegates in CO, all of them pledged.  So it's 34 out of 34 for the entire process.
NateSilver538	718923079859249158	2016-04-09T22:06:33	The idea Clinton won the south because it is conservative isn't true. She won it because she does well with black voters overall.
NateSilver538	718894713705598976	2016-04-09T20:13:50	Also some Dems who like what Bernie stands for but would prefer Clinton as nominee. May flip back to Clinton when she looks more vulnerable.
NateSilver538	718893567482011648	2016-04-09T20:09:17	Maybe "momentum" is actually a negative in the Democratic race since it can make your supporters complacent.
NateSilver538	718892904370954240	2016-04-09T20:06:39	Sanders likely to win Wyoming caucus but margin is narrower than I would have expected: 
NateSilver538	718889216894078978	2016-04-09T19:52:00	Trump doing great in the Northeast is already priced into these projections, IOW. They also have him winning Indiana, which is questionable.
NateSilver538	718887915577675776	2016-04-09T19:46:50	Assuming Trump gets shut out in Colorado, he could win *every* delegate in New York and still project to just 1,199. 
NateSilver538	718836859158179842	2016-04-09T16:23:57	Even if Trump sweeps EVERYTHING through mid-May, including states where he's a big underdog, still vulnerable to a bad performance in CA.
NateSilver538	718836449424977920	2016-04-09T16:22:19	This is delusional on the part of Trump's campaign. Math doesn't work.  
NateSilver538	718582265358524416	2016-04-08T23:32:17	Snowpening Day. 
NateSilver538	718523168017678337	2016-04-08T19:37:27	If Trump gets shut out in Colorado -- which seems possible -- he'd be down to 1,175 projected delegates. 
NateSilver538	718471755015262208	2016-04-08T16:13:09	Taking a long weekend in Chicago, free from thinking about the campaign. Here's the view from outside my hotel.

NateSilver538	718170487692648449	2016-04-07T20:16:01	To be more precise, Trump's election day vote tends to match his polls. Other candidates (esp. Cruz) win undecideds &amp; gain relative to him.
NateSilver538	718170173430173698	2016-04-07T20:14:46	Oh great now Team Trump is all skewedpolls. Funny thing is he's actually *underperformed* his polls so far. 
NateSilver538	718157644016590853	2016-04-07T19:24:59	Trump should be fine in the Northeast. Certainly in NY. Probably in PA/MD. But CA would make me nervous. 
NateSilver538	718156756346646528	2016-04-07T19:21:28	Meanwhile, Trump's actual vote share isn't growing much.  
NateSilver538	718155957281415172	2016-04-07T19:18:17	Big story being overlooked: Trump's now going to need 40%+ to win in most states. Mid-30s won't cut it. 
NateSilver538	718146626213318656	2016-04-07T18:41:12	This is good

NateSilver538	717781489891549185	2016-04-06T18:30:17	Also, too few Kasich at-large delegates (10) for him to have a full slate in WV. But Cruz (36) and Trump (31) arguably have too many.
NateSilver538	717779902745997313	2016-04-06T18:23:59	Republican voters in West Virginia will have to pick 22 at-large delegates from a list of 220. What could go wrong? 
NateSilver538	717769754468069376	2016-04-06T17:43:39	LPDonovan: Basically we don't know very much unless we have samples large enough to break out the ~10 extremely blue districts in/near NYC.
NateSilver538	717768234863296512	2016-04-06T17:37:37	LPDonovan: It's a problem to lump NYC &amp; LI together. LI &amp; Staten Island will be great for Trump. Manhattan/Brooklyn/Bronx maybe not.
NateSilver538	717744689038934016	2016-04-06T16:04:03	The delegates mostly are not "the establishment". Instead, they're grassroots activists, local party leaders, etc. 
NateSilver538	717744041560051712	2016-04-06T16:01:29	Cruz is way more likely than Ryan or Kasich to emerge out of a contested convention. 
NateSilver538	717732815790546944	2016-04-06T15:16:52	Ted Cruz, not Paul Ryan, would probably win a contested convention:  
NateSilver538	717721968645173248	2016-04-06T14:33:46	PA polling looks like IL, not WI, with Trump in high (not mid) 30s and Cruz / Kasich splitting the balance evenly. 
NateSilver538	717721145860947968	2016-04-06T14:30:30	Though uncommitted, those PA delegates are elected on the ballot, so assumptions about delegates from other states may not hold up well.
NateSilver538	717720808567750656	2016-04-06T14:29:10	The 54 unbound delegates in PA are a wild card. Not many pro-Trump but many say will vote for state/district winner. 
NateSilver538	717602735940567040	2016-04-06T06:39:59	Plurality favorite or majority favorite? Have to sleep on it. Good argument that markets underprice both Trump and Cruz vs. Ryan etc. (7/)
NateSilver538	717602291562455040	2016-04-06T06:38:13	Despite all that, Trump has various ways to win nomination with or without getting to 1237 by California. Still probably the favorite. (6/)
NateSilver538	717602114311159809	2016-04-06T06:37:31	Trump‚Äôs at 35% now in California, per our polling average. If that‚Äôs what he gets on June 7, no way he gets to 1237 delegates by then. (5/)
NateSilver538	717601923298418688	2016-04-06T06:36:45	That‚Äôs a big problem for Trump, especially given that Trump consistently performs mediocrely vs. his polls and wins few late-deciders. (4/)

NateSilver538	717601603746922496	2016-04-06T06:35:29	The big story is that Trump seems to have a -- let‚Äôs not call it a ‚Äúceiling‚Äù -- but certainly lots of upward resistance in his support. (2/)

NateSilver538	717563482955194368	2016-04-06T04:04:00	Trump came close to his results in neighboring states tonight. Cruz had a breakthrough, though. 
NateSilver538	717535499364204544	2016-04-06T02:12:48	American Research Group (ARG) poll off by a mere 31 percentage points on the GOP side so far. 
NateSilver538	717533175346511872	2016-04-06T02:03:34	A few weeks ago, we set Trump's over/under in Wisconsin at 25 delegates. Gonna be way short of that. 
NateSilver538	717521938890022912	2016-04-06T01:18:55	Geographic splits in exit polls pretty good for Cruz. If right, Trump highly competitive in WI-7, others dicey. 
NateSilver538	717518427192180737	2016-04-06T01:04:58	Combined pre-election + exit poll estimate would have Cruz winning WI by 8-9%. High margin of error though. 
NateSilver538	717514811265916929	2016-04-06T00:50:36	Walker's the only Republican where you wonder if he dropped out too early. Everyone else just-in-time or too late.

NateSilver538	717452072275341312	2016-04-05T20:41:18	Has enough happened over past 10 days to justify Trump's nomination odds falling from 70% to 47% at betting markets?

NateSilver538	717439893274759168	2016-04-05T19:52:54	Voters probably don't care much about the media narrative on Trump, but delegates potentially do. A lot of delegates are being chosen now.
NateSilver538	717439470526668805	2016-04-05T19:51:13	Momentum matters in Wisconsin. "Trump in disarray" narrative could revert back to "Trump invincible" if he wins.

NateSilver538	717349213340872704	2016-04-05T13:52:34	The claim that it's only the GOP "establishment" opposed to Trump is lazy &amp; inaccurate. Be skeptical of anyone who frames GOP race that way.

NateSilver538	717010579563667456	2016-04-04T15:26:58	jaselzer: Percentage points.
NateSilver538	716998747755048960	2016-04-04T14:39:57	Since Rubio dropped out, Kasich has gained 8% in our national polling average, Cruz 7% and Trump just 3%. 
NateSilver538	716984497825300480	2016-04-04T13:43:19	Also a symptom of Trump's co-dependency with the media. Many national media outlets ignored delegate selection until recently, so did Trump.
NateSilver538	716983827609034752	2016-04-04T13:40:40	Some irony in Trump tweeting out THANK YOU after every poll, totally ignoring the actual delegate selection process. 
NateSilver538	716835965315203072	2016-04-04T03:53:06	Sanders (41%) has a larger share of his party's vote than Trump (37%). With blue states backloaded, he may also wind up with more raw votes.

NateSilver538	716643845245632512	2016-04-03T15:09:41	Trump-shocks-the-world narrative was so compelling that it had 9 mo's of media life. "Is Trump imploding?" only now becoming a better story.
NateSilver538	716642059751440385	2016-04-03T15:02:36	Much of what's changed in press coverage of Trump, which has finally become tough, is that he was sort of an underdog story until recently.
NateSilver538	716496424691744768	2016-04-03T05:23:54	skepticalsports: Quite possible. But if Trump were a "generic" GOP candidate he might be priced at 80-90% likely to win the nomination.
NateSilver538	716494755748823040	2016-04-03T05:17:16	If WI (and CO and ND) go real bad for Trump, I may soon be on the Trump-is-an-underdog bandwagon. But CW has often gotten ahead of itself.
NateSilver538	716493007344771072	2016-04-03T05:10:19	I get the not-Trump case -- delegates don't like Trump, etc -- but that's a *big* discount for a guy who's almost sure to win the plurality.
NateSilver538	716490549969203200	2016-04-03T05:00:33	Trump now &lt;50% to win GOP nomination on betting markets. Close call but I'd be tempted to bet Trump at even odds. 
NateSilver538	716483680055726080	2016-04-03T04:33:15	0.001% of people in America could name even one of them. Fyi.

NateSilver538	716374886650941440	2016-04-02T21:20:57	Cruz has: 1. More backing from state GOP parties, which pick delegates 2. More appeal to Trump voters 3. Most popular support of non-Trumps
NateSilver538	716373252835254272	2016-04-02T21:14:27	I think people are underrating Cruz's odds, and overrating Kasich/Ryan/other, conditional on there being a contested convention.
NateSilver538	716359327452409861	2016-04-02T20:19:07	We expected Colorado to be bad for Trump, projecting him to get 7/34 delegates. 0/3 so far.

NateSilver538	716274971748777985	2016-04-02T14:43:55	Another thought experiment: imagine how media would cover the Democratic race if Al Sharpton were leading the field with a ~35% plurality.
NateSilver538	716270948677246976	2016-04-02T14:27:56	A good framing question to ask about Trump is this: How could someone so profoundly unpopular become the nominee of a major political party?
NateSilver538	716017344343056384	2016-04-01T21:40:12	Y'all know that half of "white working-class" voters are women, right?

NateSilver538	715593450230530048	2016-03-31T17:35:48	Those delegates have a *lot* of power. Even if, abstractly, nominating Trump is GOP's least-worst outcome, they might not go along.
NateSilver538	715592762603782145	2016-03-31T17:33:04	People may be underestimating how much of a problem it is for Trump that most RNC delegates will not personally be fans of Trump.

NateSilver538	715582771503173632	2016-03-31T16:53:22	FHQ: In that case, does a candidate still need 1,237 delegates to win or is the threshold lowered?
NateSilver538	715568100666646528	2016-03-31T15:55:04	If Rule 40 is enforced, what happens to Kasich &amp; Rubio delegates? Can they abstain / vote uncommitted? Or must they choose Cruz or Trump?
NateSilver538	715563773139017729	2016-03-31T15:37:52	Pew Research poll: 75% of voters say the media has given Donald Trump too much attention.

NateSilver538	715232050056441856	2016-03-30T17:39:43	In the summer, the media spent more time talking about Trump's dominance in polls than his inflammatory remarks.

NateSilver538	710484035991162880	2016-03-17T15:12:48	It's actually quite unlucky that a 16-seed has never won.  So go go FGCU, Hampton, Holy Cross and Austin Peay. 
NateSilver538	710483398138134528	2016-03-17T15:10:16	An ode to No. 16 seeds, which never catch a break. 
NateSilver538	710481947940818946	2016-03-17T15:04:31	.FiveThirtyEight is 2 yrs old. My fav story is ‚ÄúThe Poorest Corner of Town‚Äù bencasselman  
NateSilver538	710469280404512770	2016-03-17T14:14:10	CarlBialik: Yeah, it makes sense to wait for lots of reasons. The play-in games can make a bigger difference than people realize too.
NateSilver538	710465931500085248	2016-03-17T14:00:52	I know from traffic on 538s NCAA picks that we're a nation of procrastinators. Always a big spike when brackets due. 
NateSilver538	710454622268186624	2016-03-17T13:15:56	Also worth noting that Kasich has few endorsements -- fewer than Cruz! Not clear he's on Team Establishment. 
NateSilver538	710449831756623872	2016-03-17T12:56:54	.dliebelson @CurlyCrayy put numbers to the violence at Trump rallies: More than 50 people arrested since Feb. 29 
NateSilver538	710448587914629120	2016-03-17T12:51:57	Fairly strong possibility that Trump won't get to 1237 delegates on his own but would with Kasich's delegates. Come to your own conclusions.
NateSilver538	710277000460509185	2016-03-17T01:30:07	Trump is a good argument against American Exceptionalism. 
NateSilver538	710267104641941504	2016-03-17T00:50:48	Game theorists will have fun with this election. Everyone forgot it's a multi-round game where credibility matters. 
NateSilver538	710264247259832321	2016-03-17T00:39:27	Live-updating win probabilities in our NCAA tournament bracket this year. Pretty cool.   
NateSilver538	710258616310173696	2016-03-17T00:17:04	Don't forget humans created the computer program that can beat humans at Go:  
NateSilver538	710253358750179328	2016-03-16T23:56:11	I honestly can't remember if it's Merrick Garland, Marland Gerrick, Garland Merrick or Gerrick Marland.
NateSilver538	710231565377347585	2016-03-16T22:29:35	dbernstein marcambinder: I point out specific instances all the time on Twitter and on FiveThirtyEight. This isn't a drive-by critique.
NateSilver538	710217366219726848	2016-03-16T21:33:09	marcambinder: It's also too concerned about media stories. Threatening violence at the convention is a *WAY* bigger deal than Lewandowski.
NateSilver538	710217014187532289	2016-03-16T21:31:46	marcambinder: Furthermore, media undermines its moral authority by constantly inviting Trump on TV and bowing to his threats, eg on debates
NateSilver538	710216569574526976	2016-03-16T21:30:00	marcambinder: Also, there's far too much equivocation. Many stories about Chicago blamed both sides, downplayed Trump's role.
NateSilver538	710216241831612416	2016-03-16T21:28:41	marcambinder: Threatening violence to the political process requires special condemnation. It's been covered as "just another" controversy.
NateSilver538	710191356463992832	2016-03-16T19:49:48	Figure the calculus looks something like this: 
NateSilver538	710190960140001280	2016-03-16T19:48:14	Sorry, wrong link! Here's my take on SCOTUS and why GOP might be dumb to block Garland. 
NateSilver538	710176997192892416	2016-03-16T18:52:45	Also, the media is failing in its responsibilities by not making a bigger deal of Trump's threats of violence. Embarrassing and cowardly.
NateSilver538	710172004234764288	2016-03-16T18:32:54	Exclusive: Trump Voters‚Äô Aversion To Foreign-Sounding Names Cost Him Delegates 
NateSilver538	710119581235474433	2016-03-16T15:04:36	Now Trump's talking about riots at the convention. Shows the cost of the GOP's cowardice in not standing up to him. 
NateSilver538	710106726696161280	2016-03-16T14:13:31	Guys I think it's gonna be Clinton. 
NateSilver538	709974179517485056	2016-03-16T05:26:49	This is big: Trump voters' aversion to candidates w/ foreign-sounding names cost him at least 2 delegates. Example: 
NateSilver538	709971617397526528	2016-03-16T05:16:38	Only states won by Clinton '92 (primaries), Clinton '92 (general), Clinton '96, Clinton '08 and Clinton '16: Arkansas, Ohio, Tennessee
NateSilver538	709969733882388480	2016-03-16T05:09:09	Clinton's won 17 states so far, counting Missouri. Of those, only 7 were states she won in 2008; Obama won the other 10.
NateSilver538	709963331336073217	2016-03-16T04:43:43	Wow, Clinton with a lead in MO now. 
NateSilver538	709941209234612224	2016-03-16T03:15:49	Possible that Cruz will narrowly lose 3 states tonight that he would have won in a 2-way race. 
NateSilver538	709930401029029888	2016-03-16T02:32:52	Polls pretty good on the GOP side too. Underestimated Cruz a bit in North Carolina but not bad at all overall.
NateSilver538	709930148016070660	2016-03-16T02:31:51	After the disaster in Michigan, polls and polling averages having a *very* good night in the Democratic race: 
NateSilver538	709925516720128001	2016-03-16T02:13:27	Did the events of the past week wind up helping Trump?  PrimaryDay 
NateSilver538	709921902974914562	2016-03-16T01:59:06	Silver lining for Sanders tonight: seems to be making progress among black voters. 
NateSilver538	709913315460440064	2016-03-16T01:24:58	After tonight, Kasich will have won 1 state out of 29. 
NateSilver538	709912283036721153	2016-03-16T01:20:52	On average between 5 states voting tonight, just 17% of Dems were late deciders. Split evenly between Sanders &amp; HRC. 
NateSilver538	709908155610865664	2016-03-16T01:04:28	Easy to see Wisconsin being a state where Kasich and Cruz split the anti-Trump vote and Trump winning 40-30-30. 
NateSilver538	709889830331813894	2016-03-15T23:51:39	Florida showing probably Trump's most impressive in any state to date... 
NateSilver538	709887453985955841	2016-03-15T23:42:12	Rubio at just 2 percent in Ohio exit polls. Possible his advising his voters to go Kasich could swing the election. 
NateSilver538	709879185486049281	2016-03-15T23:09:21	Let's be real: Ain't nothing in these early votes that suggest anything other than a Trump blowout in Florida.
NateSilver538	709872605088583680	2016-03-15T22:43:12	This may be mooted in a couple hours, but Ted Cruz has been a pretty good anti-Trump so far:  
NateSilver538	709749187047497728	2016-03-15T14:32:47	Seems important.  
NateSilver538	709842605153132544	2016-03-15T20:43:59	Live from Nerd-a-Lago, it's FiveThirtyEight's election night liveblog. 
NateSilver538	709838251041882113	2016-03-15T20:26:41	The main thing: Illinois and Missouri matter a LOT on the GOP side. This isn't just about Ohio and Florida. 
NateSilver538	709837762879463425	2016-03-15T20:24:45	Here's what we'll be watching for tonight: 
NateSilver538	709824714525560832	2016-03-15T19:32:54	Rationale to form a Conservative 3rd-party ticket is plausible. But still a challenge to get the logistics in order. 
NateSilver538	709807036716998656	2016-03-15T18:22:39	-----&gt;  &lt;----- 
NateSilver538	709783290413195264	2016-03-15T16:48:18	Profiles in courage. 
NateSilver538	709759878919823361	2016-03-15T15:15:16	In Illinois and Missouri, however, the demographic model has Clinton favored in the high single digits. 
NateSilver538	709759059495411712	2016-03-15T15:12:01	We've got demographic forecasts of the Democratic race. They suggest upset potential for Sanders in Ohio.  
NateSilver538	709543407496998913	2016-03-15T00:55:05	Our women's March Madness predictions:  
NateSilver538	709540761457524736	2016-03-15T00:44:34	Non-politics: our women's NCAA tournament projections are out!  UConn 70% to repeat, nobody else above 10%. 
NateSilver538	709539670632308737	2016-03-15T00:40:14	You look at how badly Clinton lost in Nebraska, Kansas &amp; Minnesota caucuses, and her Iowa tie/win really stands out as an exception.
NateSilver538	709539012260839424	2016-03-15T00:37:37	The data suggests that Bernie over-performs in caucuses relative to primaries. IA &amp; NV exceptions, maybe because of Clinton ground game.
NateSilver538	709504535832731648	2016-03-14T22:20:37	On our podcast today, we talk about the lack of courage &amp; clarity in responses to Trump's provocations to violence. 
NateSilver538	709473048131461121	2016-03-14T20:15:30	What's at stake for Republicans in the March 15 primaries:  
NateSilver538	709461816133427201	2016-03-14T19:30:52	This NYT video will remove all doubt, should you have any, that Trump is lying to deny he's incited violence. 
NateSilver538	709409713977483266	2016-03-14T16:03:50	On the GOP side, Rubio would now need a Michigan-magnitude polling error to win Florida. 
NateSilver538	709409076606869504	2016-03-14T16:01:18	We'll issue updated demographic forecasts for the Dem race too and see whether those or the polls do best. Open question at this point.
NateSilver538	709408735656079361	2016-03-14T15:59:57	Helpfully, recent Illinois polls have everything from Clinton +42 to Sanders +2. Our average has Clinton +7.

NateSilver538	709175142463750144	2016-03-14T00:31:44	Here are our NCAA tournament picks. Kansas is the "favorite" but still just a 19% chance to win it all. 
NateSilver538	709134068911308801	2016-03-13T21:48:31	Pretty much the only human or computer ranking that has Oregon &gt; Michigan State is RPI, which is the worst ranking.

NateSilver538	709133316155437056	2016-03-13T21:45:32	WTF NCAA
NateSilver538	709067777932398593	2016-03-13T17:25:06	Been experimenting with college basketball Elo ratings. We'll probably add these to our NCAA forecasts this year. 
NateSilver538	709039299619123200	2016-03-13T15:31:56	Cruz gaining a bit in Illinois, but the anti-Trump is divided so Trump is the favorite despite middling numbers. 
NateSilver538	709038576982499328	2016-03-13T15:29:04	In Florida, though, Trump's up to 89% in our polls-plus forecast and 98% in our polls-only forecast. 
NateSilver538	709038074588745728	2016-03-13T15:27:04	Kasich's pulled narrowly ahead of Trump in our Ohio polling average. 
NateSilver538	709027268585242624	2016-03-13T14:44:08	Wonder if Trump's recent behavior is intended to produce an implied threat that a contested convention could become violent.
NateSilver538	708882957709217792	2016-03-13T05:10:42	This pretty much says it all about this election 
NateSilver538	708884755316666369	2016-03-13T05:17:50	Delegates won since Tuesday: uncommitted 12 Rubio 11 Cruz 10 Kasich 9 Trump 1
NateSilver538	708828875535548416	2016-03-13T01:35:47	So about 80% of the vote that wasn't originally for Duke or Edwards went against Duke. 
NateSilver538	708828147270230017	2016-03-13T01:32:54	Of interest: David Duke got 32% in the 12-way Louisiana gubernatorial primary in 1991. Only improved to 39% in 2-way runoff a month later.
NateSilver538	708817726891040768	2016-03-13T00:51:29	Here‚Äôs the current breakdown of Republican unbound delegates. 
NateSilver538	708807275499167744	2016-03-13T00:09:58	24 states have voted so far and Trump hasn't gotten a majority anywhere. Cruz just did it in Wyoming, although on tiny turnout.
NateSilver538	708772577142038528	2016-03-12T21:52:05	
NateSilver538	708745991969742848	2016-03-12T20:06:27	172 delegates between territories, DC, and states that hold conventions. Basically freebies for the GOP establishment, bad group for Trump.
NateSilver538	708733721256583168	2016-03-12T19:17:41	Trump is not only losing to Cruz but also Rubio in Wyoming. Sad! 
NateSilver538	708653145715564544	2016-03-12T13:57:30	Deceptive headline. Trump cancelled the rally amid protests. Need active, not passive, voice. 
NateSilver538	708465527212150784	2016-03-12T01:31:58	Reminder: Trump has defended, if not encouraged, violence against protesters. 
NateSilver538	708410605426843648	2016-03-11T21:53:44	Compare this (from December):  And this (from today):  
NateSilver538	708399911147061248	2016-03-11T21:11:14	Trump polling at ~35% on average in March 15 states, which is usually enough to win against a divided field. 
NateSilver538	708389847698939904	2016-03-11T20:31:15	For those at SSAC: 538 will be taping a live episode of Hot Takedown in Room 205 at 4 pm. For those not at SSAC: Happy Friday!

NateSilver538	708382574180179968	2016-03-11T20:02:21	How Marco Rubio‚Äôs Made-For-TV Campaign Fell Flat  
NateSilver538	708380790485344260	2016-03-11T19:55:16	Favorability among Hispanics, according to Gallup: Clinton +33 Sanders +19 Rubio +6 Kasich +1 Cruz -4  Trump -65 
NateSilver538	708375799766843392	2016-03-11T19:35:26	This is important. Failing to reach 1,237 delegates by California does not necessarily equal contested convention. 
NateSilver538	708364012115902464	2016-03-11T18:48:35	So proud of the FiveThirtyEight data visualization team, who picked up three medals at Malofiej24

NateSilver538	708309044390338562	2016-03-11T15:10:10	What the race would look like if Cruz and Trump were running 1-on-1:   
NateSilver538	708180369808338945	2016-03-11T06:38:52	Virgin Islands caucus results are in. It was a landslide for uncommitted. 
NateSilver538	708100224972095492	2016-03-11T01:20:24	You might see the death rattle of of GOP establishment on CNN tonight -- would be quite the exclusive. GOPDebate 
NateSilver538	708101784120602625	2016-03-11T01:26:35	Live commentary on GOPDebate on FiveThirtyEight ! 
NateSilver538	708053835911135234	2016-03-10T22:16:04	What could possibly make Trump think he could abuse the press and they'd come crawling back? 
NateSilver538	708048011071459328	2016-03-10T21:52:55	Let's dispel with this fiction that Marco Rubio is the only candidate who repeats himself. 
NateSilver538	708031612441780225	2016-03-10T20:47:45	Also not obvious: does Rubio's slim but nonzero chance of winning Florida outweigh votes he'd take away from Cruz/Kasich in IL/MO/OH/NC?
NateSilver538	708030994939551746	2016-03-10T20:45:18	Also tried to figure out if Cruz alone or Cruz + Kasich tandem are best hope for anti-Trumps. Answer not obvious. 
NateSilver538	708030400975740928	2016-03-10T20:42:56	Now? Very possibly too little too late but Cruz is underestimated: 1. Not so far behind Trump 2. Tends to beat polls 
NateSilver538	708029772929089536	2016-03-10T20:40:27	Our guess is that Cruz would be leading Trump in delegates had it been a 1-on-1 race from the start. 
NateSilver538	708025369954230272	2016-03-10T20:22:57	Overall, endorsements have been pretty frozen. Since 3/1 Cruz: 2 endorsements Rubio: 2 Kasich: 1 Trump: 0 
NateSilver538	708024613192790017	2016-03-10T20:19:56	Ted Cruz finally got a senator to endorse him.

NateSilver538	707947268163420160	2016-03-10T15:12:36	Also hurting Rubio: Republican voters becoming increasingly tactical. Talk radio skepticism. Appeared sick/tired in last week's debate.
NateSilver538	707946900415225857	2016-03-10T15:11:08	What hurt Rubio? Despite slightly beating his polls on Super Tuesday, still a bad night. Media &amp; voters appropriately skeptical thereafter.
NateSilver538	707946733049880577	2016-03-10T15:10:28	There's not really much evidence that Rubio's mockery of Trump hurt him. Rubio slightly beat his polls on Super Tuesday after "small hands".
NateSilver538	707790219148435457	2016-03-10T04:48:33	There are reasonable arguments for superdelegates but this by DWStweets is ahistorical and disingenuous.

NateSilver538	707732921579343873	2016-03-10T01:00:52	Very possible Sanders will win more states than Clinton without coming especially close to her in pledged delegates.

NateSilver538	707573168622465024	2016-03-09T14:26:04	Also worth looking at our demographic targets, which implied a much closer race in MI than polls. 
NateSilver538	707572374267371520	2016-03-09T14:22:54	We've tweaked our polling-based forecasts to be a bit more cautious for Dems. Still would have had Hillary as 98% favorite in MI though!
NateSilver538	707562913079275520	2016-03-09T13:45:19	Marco Rubio never had a base, and it showed yesterday: 
NateSilver538	707553233959591936	2016-03-09T13:06:51	Which candidates staying in would give anti-Trump Republicans the best chance of stopping Trump?

NateSilver538	707452110204477444	2016-03-09T06:25:01	Meanwhile, here are some extended-play thoughts on Marco Rubio: 
NateSilver538	707449299932684289	2016-03-09T06:13:51	Another big question from tonight: are polls showing big Clinton leads in states like OH &amp; IL reliable? 
NateSilver538	707448646325895170	2016-03-09T06:11:15	skepticalsports: Maybe if Cruz gets to 50+% in Idaho? (Then becomes winner-take-all). Don't think there's enough vote out for that, though.
NateSilver538	707447358687203328	2016-03-09T06:06:08	skepticalsports: Doubtful that Cruz can make up enough ground in HI, which doesn't have many delegates and is super proportional.
NateSilver538	707446181941678082	2016-03-09T06:01:28	Quick thoughts on tonight: Trump: Birdie Cruz: Birdie Kasich: Par/Bogey Rubio: Double Bogey 
NateSilver538	707445632336850944	2016-03-09T05:59:17	GOP delegates if things finish exactly as they stand right now in MI+MS+ID: Trump 62 Cruz 52 Kasich 17 Rubio 0 
NateSilver538	707431115091537920	2016-03-09T05:01:35	Idaho looking pretty good for Cruz, although not a ton in from Ada County (Boise) yet. 
NateSilver538	707426755414458368	2016-03-09T04:44:16	It's weird, because polling has actually been pretty good in the primaries to date. Polls very accurate in MI GOP race tonight, for example.
NateSilver538	707426425679257600	2016-03-09T04:42:57	In the famous New Hampshire upset in '08, Clinton trailed Obama by 8 points. Big upset. But today, Sanders trailed Clinton by *21* and won.
NateSilver538	707424669784285184	2016-03-09T04:35:59	March 15 looks good for Clinton, but calendar turns *very* friendly for Sanders in late March and early April.

NateSilver538	707417355262042112	2016-03-09T04:06:55	Basically: 1) Demographics suggested a closer race than polls. 2) Possible Clinton voter complacency. 3) History of bad polling in Michigan.
NateSilver538	707417109492592642	2016-03-09T04:05:56	I said this afternoon I had a ‚Äúgut feeling‚Äù that Sanders could beat his polling in MI. Here's what was behind that. 
NateSilver538	707411490484183040	2016-03-09T03:43:37	Sanders is winning 30% of the black vote in MI, per exit polls. Makes a huge difference versus getting 10% or 15%. 
NateSilver538	707398354377043969	2016-03-09T02:51:25	If Cruz is the only guy who can stop Trump, would the GOP "establishment" take the deal? 
NateSilver538	707392312700248067	2016-03-09T02:27:24	If Sanders wins MI tonight, it will break Gary Hart's record in 1984 NH for greatest upset vs. final polling aveage.

NateSilver538	706344167593607168	2016-03-06T05:02:27	Big secret of the GOP race is that Trump isn't actually that far ahead. Trump 34.4% of votes so far, Cruz 28.6%.

NateSilver538	706256494673715201	2016-03-05T23:14:04	If you're reporting this as anything other than a huge night for Cruz and a terrible one for Trump, you're doing it wrong.
NateSilver538	706247596315172864	2016-03-05T22:38:43	Cruz is winning big states like Texas and Alaska. Trump can only win tiny states like New Hampshire. Sad! 
NateSilver538	706236686930460673	2016-03-05T21:55:22	Trump will need to make up ground in places like Overland Park, KS. Educated, moderate suburbs -- NOT Trump country. 
NateSilver538	706233698958647296	2016-03-05T21:43:29	Assuming Cruz holds on in Kansas, the Midwest will be forming an anti-Trump wall.

NateSilver538	706198704424919040	2016-03-05T19:24:26	No matter how this plays out, the Trump phenomenon is going to go down as this generation's Milgram experiment.
NateSilver538	706188351712456704	2016-03-05T18:43:18	In other words, it's a really good result for Cruz, but also somewhere we might expect him to do relatively well.
NateSilver538	706187690966913024	2016-03-05T18:40:40	FWIW, Waldo County, Maine, which Cruz apparently won big, was more favorable to Paul and Santorum in 2012 than the state average.

NateSilver538	705593935993901057	2016-03-04T03:21:18	It's kind of dumb to argue about national polls now that lots of states are actually voting.

NateSilver538	705543488843202560	2016-03-04T00:00:50	jonathanchait: It sometimes feels like Rubio is about 90% of the way to being a VERY good candidate but the 10% makes a lot of difference.
NateSilver538	705540804337651712	2016-03-03T23:50:10	jonathanchait: Yeah, we're not really disagreeing. Rubio and Cruz began as popular-ish but hardly with unlimited personal appeal to burn.
NateSilver538	705540164626554880	2016-03-03T23:47:38	PatrickRuffini: Maine feels like Trump with an outside shot of Kasich?
NateSilver538	705539363946545153	2016-03-03T23:44:27	jonathanchait: Not sure that's true, though. Trump underperformed polls in IA, SC, Super Tuesday after late clashes with opponents.
NateSilver538	705538128904372227	2016-03-03T23:39:32	Used to think "Trump's winning because the other candidates suck" was a lazy theory. Maybe it needs another look?

NateSilver538	705535029066244097	2016-03-03T23:27:13	Trump does not just divide GOP voters from elites. He also splits GOP voters almost in 2. Many don't like him. 
NateSilver538	705534324498685952	2016-03-03T23:24:25	In exit polls only 49% of Republicans would be happy with Trump as their nominee. But Rubio/Cruz not much better. 
NateSilver538	705533566168518657	2016-03-03T23:21:25	My latest: Republican voters kind of hate all of their candidates. 
NateSilver538	705518349015453697	2016-03-03T22:20:56	Arguably one could short contested convention but go long on Romney/Ryan being nominated, who are at just 1-2%.

NateSilver538	704017987330842624	2016-02-28T18:59:02	hbryant42: Lot of debate about when the New Deal coalition collapsed. Could say 1968 or 1980 or even 1994.

NateSilver538	704011880038318081	2016-02-28T18:34:46	In the primaries, Trump skeptics could fairly be accused of magical thinking. Needed polls to change. Opposite true for general election.
NateSilver538	704010641619734528	2016-02-28T18:29:51	Your periodic reminder that Donald Trump is really unpopular with the country as a whole: 
NateSilver538	703988380812582912	2016-02-28T17:01:24	This Republicans-for-LBJ commercial is strange and kind of amazing. Wonder if team Clinton studying this stuff.

NateSilver538	703975062500732932	2016-02-28T16:08:28	Strongest correlate I've found for Trump support is Google searches for the n-word. Others have reported this too: 
NateSilver538	703967919022043138	2016-02-28T15:40:05	Trump outlined his campaign strategy in 1987's Art of the Deal: get free media coverage by saying outrageous things 
NateSilver538	703969470902091776	2016-02-28T15:46:15	Let's dispel with this fiction that Donald Trump doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing. 
NateSilver538	703814716251049984	2016-02-28T05:31:19	jpodhoretz: Not much post-debate polling yet, but trend before was Trump &amp; Rubio gaining at Cruz expense. Doubt last 3 days will stop that.

NateSilver538	703793737831485441	2016-02-28T04:07:57	Has there ever been a team that's both so good and so well-liked as the Warriors?
NateSilver538	703776024920788993	2016-02-28T02:57:34	meganliberman: Clemson a bit less of an outlier given that there were only a couple recent polls of SC. Still, great outcome for Clinton.
NateSilver538	618774217857835010	2015-07-08T13:30:44	Bernie Sanders could win Iowa and New Hampshire. Then lose everywhere else.  
NateSilver538	703755572743696384	2016-02-28T01:36:18	Agree. Hillary Clinton's political skills are badly underrated. Lots of premature "Clinton in disarray!" stories. 
NateSilver538	703751792992116736	2016-02-28T01:21:17	One might be tempted to say that 96% white New Hampshire has proved not to be well-representative of the Democratic electorate overall.
NateSilver538	703750273357975552	2016-02-28T01:15:14	The South Carolina result is about what one would have expected from the Democratic race in the summer or fall. 
NateSilver538	703747759065718784	2016-02-28T01:05:15	Is it over?
NateSilver538	703747244214902789	2016-02-28T01:03:12	sluggahjells: I dunno seems smart that our model had Clinton +38 when nobody else expected anything like that. 
NateSilver538	703746371023708161	2016-02-28T00:59:44	MysteryPollster ForecasterEnten: Yeah, Obama way beat his numbers in 2008. Margins can inflate when a candidate gives up on a state.
NateSilver538	703745887642755077	2016-02-28T00:57:49	So actually this may wind up being too conservative! To its credit, Clemson poll had Clinton +50.  
NateSilver538	703741218132459521	2016-02-28T00:39:15	Very likely things will tighten, but if Clinton wins by this margin it will count as a pretty big polling error. 
NateSilver538	703736860972072960	2016-02-28T00:21:57	If it were just South Carolina I'd say "meh" but the polling has also turned toward Clinton in Super Tuesday states. 
NateSilver538	703736317641891840	2016-02-28T00:19:47	Democratic race is tilting strongly to Clinton. Her victory in SC was expected, but margin is a problem for Sanders. 
NateSilver538	703732343983439872	2016-02-28T00:04:00	Exit polls have Clinton winning approximately 68-31. 
NateSilver538	703731436159942656	2016-02-28T00:00:23	Clinton wins South Carolina, projects everyone.
NateSilver538	703726873197596672	2016-02-27T23:42:15	Don't make any inferences from this, but two-thirds of voters would prefer a candidate whose name rhymes with "linton", per exit polls.
NateSilver538	703723758377426944	2016-02-27T23:29:53	Waht if Twiterr had been inviented before spell chek?
NateSilver538	703723156121452544	2016-02-27T23:27:29	Gonna get in trouble for revealing this, but exit polls strongly suggest that Lincoln Chafee will NOT win the SC Democratic primary.
NateSilver538	703721435353710592	2016-02-27T23:20:39	"Polls-plus" forecast is even more aggressive, Clinton +38. Not sure I buy it but exit poll teasers good for her. 
NateSilver538	703714652098846720	2016-02-27T22:53:42	"With the exception of the 2016 election," will be a common phrase in PhD dissertations in 2044.
NateSilver538	703712778964566016	2016-02-27T22:46:15	Per our demographic targets, Sanders "should" lose SC by 20% in an a 50/50 national race. 
NateSilver538	703710852877258752	2016-02-27T22:38:36	It may be that this is the week Hillary Clinton basically wraps up the Democratic nomination and nobody notices because Trump!
NateSilver538	703708727669604352	2016-02-27T22:30:09	ForecasterEnten: I know we're not supposed to speculate, but looks good for O'Malley.
NateSilver538	703705989351133184	2016-02-27T22:19:16	Per preliminary exit polls, more than 80% of SC Dems want a candidate with experience, not one "outside the political establishment". Hmm.
NateSilver538	703694894003580933	2016-02-27T21:35:11	DinoStraciatela: To an extent I think that's right. If the Democratic race were the only show in town, would be covered differently.
NateSilver538	703693465792675840	2016-02-27T21:29:30	Past week of polls have taken me from "don't count Bernie out!" to "yeah, Clinton's [i-word]". But we'll see if polls translate into votes.
NateSilver538	703692762676334592	2016-02-27T21:26:43	Clinton +32 over Sanders in our final South Carolina polling average. She's surged a bit; was +22 a week or so ago. 
NateSilver538	703688114632527872	2016-02-27T21:08:15	MrWalterShapiro: An interesting case is if Trump has more delegates but Rubio is more popular (e.g. in national polls) when primaries end.
NateSilver538	703685537123733504	2016-02-27T20:58:00	I make this more as an empirical point than to scold: Trump brings ratings AND access. Does LOTS of interviews. Part of why media loves him.
NateSilver538	703682249984765953	2016-02-27T20:44:56	Trump praised Gaddafi and Hussein at a GOP debate. For any other candidate would be covered as game-changing gaffe. Barely even noticed.
NateSilver538	703680529154109441	2016-02-27T20:38:06	Trump praised Vladimir Putin, retweeted a white supremacist, and implied President Obama is a Muslim. Has Rubio gone too far?
NateSilver538	703677438916743168	2016-02-27T20:25:49	A great way to get terrible media coverage is to have a reputation for getting great media coverage.
NateSilver538	703676602648023044	2016-02-27T20:22:30	ForecasterEnten: Let's dispel with this fiction that the media loves Marco Rubio.
NateSilver538	703675542386700288	2016-02-27T20:18:17	jonkarl: Rubio and Romney seem like the most obvious options.
NateSilver538	703674747545133056	2016-02-27T20:15:08	That includes if Trump wins in November. Some similarities to Carter in 1976. Caught party off-guard, invited big primary challenge in '80.
NateSilver538	703674062351024128	2016-02-27T20:12:24	Another thing to think about: if Trump's the nominee this year, very likely there will be a competitive Republican primary in 2020.
NateSilver538	703671485928488962	2016-02-27T20:02:10	ObsoleteDogma: Just got more footage in: 
NateSilver538	703669524118245376	2016-02-27T19:54:22	The key to good sarcasm is that about 20% of people don't get it's sarcasm. That's the optimum number.
NateSilver538	703665528536174592	2016-02-27T19:38:30	With all the focus on Trump, you all seem to be missing that Rubio has an increasingly clear pathway to a second-place victory.
NateSilver538	703663510341943296	2016-02-27T19:30:28	Rubio is getting about 2x Ted Cruz's Google search traffic since the debate; usually they're about tied. 
NateSilver538	703654965261312000	2016-02-27T18:56:31	Who would the mainstream media root for in a Trump-Clinton general election?
NateSilver538	703652168247726080	2016-02-27T18:45:24	C'mon people Clinton-Sandoval is the way more fun never-gonna-happen ticket than Clinton-Kasich. 
NateSilver538	703645794902142977	2016-02-27T18:20:05	Leightweight chockers park here. 
NateSilver538	703621474981126144	2016-02-27T16:43:26	TheStalwart: A Trump nomination would partially validate Republican-party-is-doomed predictions, somewhat regardless of what happened next.
NateSilver538	703613095923601408	2016-02-27T16:10:09	Political science types were (mostly) pretty skeptical about a Joe Biden run. Mainstream media (mostly) wasn't. 
NateSilver538	703612386654167040	2016-02-27T16:07:20	Should point out though that "The Party Decides" looks as though it will do a pretty darn good job explaining the Democratic race.
NateSilver538	703608663060180993	2016-02-27T15:52:32	Recycling this one from last month: the Republican Party may be failing. 
NateSilver538	703420565902725120	2016-02-27T03:25:06	The idea that Republican dissenters would rally around Trump relies upon a theory of parties that a Trump nomination will have disproven.
NateSilver538	703390650587324416	2016-02-27T01:26:14	Point here: a lot of professional-class Republicans might be better off opposing Trump and regrouping for 2020 than handing over the party.
NateSilver538	703353704750182401	2016-02-26T22:59:25	CarlBialik: I think it's more that HRC could be elected despite being quite unpopular, because Trump is even less popular.
NateSilver538	703350693495758848	2016-02-26T22:47:27	Also to consider: in 2020, Hillary Clinton would be 72, gunning for her party's 4th straight term, possibly quite unpopular. Tough re-elect.
NateSilver538	703345878388633600	2016-02-26T22:28:19	People are probably underrating what a shitshow the GOP convention will be, even presuming that it's not contested.
NateSilver538	703344391310745604	2016-02-26T22:22:25	DouthatNYT: Poll back in January had Rubio very narrowly ahead. 
NateSilver538	703343615456710656	2016-02-26T22:19:20	Say: * Trump wins everywhere on 3/1 except Texas (Cruz) and Minnesota (Rubio) * Rubio finishes &gt; Cruz almost everywhere. Does Cruz drop out?
NateSilver538	703329892906180608	2016-02-26T21:24:48	Simple average of recent polls in non-Texas Southern Super Tuesday states (all pre-debate/Christie): Trump 37 Rubio 21 Cruz 16
NateSilver538	703326664386719744	2016-02-26T21:11:58	chrishanretty: I also think some of the fundamentals-based models are fairly overfit on small sampels: 
NateSilver538	703325969726218240	2016-02-26T21:09:13	chrishanretty: I think the fundamentals-based models make a lot of implicit assumptions about the candidates that Trump might violate.
NateSilver538	703321897283493888	2016-02-26T20:53:02	If it's a Trump nomination, we may wind up stripping a lot of priors out of our general election forecast. More of a "polls-only" version.
NateSilver538	703314444777082880	2016-02-26T20:23:25	They're buddies. They're bullies. And they can offer one another opportunities. 
NateSilver538	703314335775457280	2016-02-26T20:22:59	Christie's endorsement of Trump totally makes sense. 
NateSilver538	703278427038683136	2016-02-26T18:00:17	Christie for VP? Only problem is that he has -18% net favorable rating (), almost as bad as Trump's.
NateSilver538	703275960787931136	2016-02-26T17:50:29	Welp, this would explain why Chris Christie never really went after Donald Trump. 
NateSilver538	703241089285758977	2016-02-26T15:31:55	Meanwhile, Clinton's state polls have started to look really good for her. Sanders has a lot of catching up to do. 
NateSilver538	703238299503235072	2016-02-26T15:20:50	Marco Rubio finally emerges as the Anti-Trump: 
NateSilver538	703050124998606848	2016-02-26T02:53:06	Rubio attacking Trump is as much about becoming the anti-Trump focal point as peeling off Trump supporters. 
NateSilver538	703043986202750976	2016-02-26T02:28:42	About 2,700 Hispanics voted for Trump in Nevada, out of about 800,000 Hispanics in the state. 
NateSilver538	703041265672257537	2016-02-26T02:17:54	Yuge spike in Google searches for Trump after Rubio asked people to Google Trump.  
NateSilver538	703031326128132096	2016-02-26T01:38:24	My view: it's time for Rubio to attack Trump. 
NateSilver538	703031078668390400	2016-02-26T01:37:25	The GOP debate is actually starting now, and here is our liveblog : 
NateSilver538	702984926044487680	2016-02-25T22:34:01	Partly it's that Rubio has exhausted the media's patience with his second place "victories" so standards now higher. That's reasonable.
NateSilver538	702980414252720128	2016-02-25T22:16:06	chrislhayes: He's within the margin of error in a region that's not supposed to be very good for him.
NateSilver538	702980182978781184	2016-02-25T22:15:11	And that's a poll of mostly southern, Super Tuesday states that shouldn't be especially favorable to Rubio.
NateSilver538	702979782615687169	2016-02-25T22:13:35	Don't get why people think Bloomberg poll is great news for Trump. It shows Rubio narrowing gap from 17% to 4% if other candidates drop out.
NateSilver538	702965374355185664	2016-02-25T21:16:20	I feel like my banal take that Trump would be a relatively weak general election candidate is becoming contrarian as the CW overreacts.
NateSilver538	702963751863980032	2016-02-25T21:09:53	Most long-term forecasts of the presidential election are way overconfident. My research with BenLauderdale: 
NateSilver538	702957589617717248	2016-02-25T20:45:24	I read 100s of For Your Consideration ads to show studios messed up &amp; need to be held accountable for OscarSoWhite 
NateSilver538	702941814072983552	2016-02-25T19:42:43	I hate this kind of self-referential argument. But possible Rubio needs to go after Trump tonight just because that's what the media wants.
NateSilver538	702931990207729664	2016-02-25T19:03:40	States we think Sanders needs to win on Mar. 1 to be on track for nomination: VT, MN, CO, MA. Also probably OK &amp; TN. 
NateSilver538	702931213842042880	2016-02-25T19:00:35	The bad news for Bernie: Not very many bright spots for him in polling of other states. Behind in too many places. 
NateSilver538	702930895280463872	2016-02-25T18:59:19	The good news for Bernie: relative to demographics, Nevada was probably his best performance to date. 
NateSilver538	702930726820454400	2016-02-25T18:58:39	We've got new state-by-state benchmarks for Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton: 
NateSilver538	702919692197961728	2016-02-25T18:14:48	What do we make of the polls showing Trump's supporters are racist and intolerant? A special FiveThirtyEight pod--&gt; 
NateSilver538	702918579239448576	2016-02-25T18:10:23	Let's quantify the conventional wisdom. Will Rubio attack Trump in the debate tonight?
NateSilver538	702916320548024320	2016-02-25T18:01:25	Of course _FloridaMan is going to vote Trump. Who are we kidding. Perfect end to this primary campaign.
NateSilver538	702909991930482688	2016-02-25T17:36:16	jbview: Ironically(?), the 28% Rubio got in the Florida Q-Pac poll is highest number he's gotten in any poll since Trump entered the race.
NateSilver538	702909362013126657	2016-02-25T17:33:45	jbview: Just national endorsements, but it "knows" FL is a good state for Rubio because he's running way ahead of his nat'l numbers there.
NateSilver538	702897554346872832	2016-02-25T16:46:50	Big split between our two models in Florida. "Polls-plus" gives Rubio a 41% chance to win, "polls-only" says 13%. 
NateSilver538	702865631503319041	2016-02-25T14:39:59	To be clear, I think Trump will win unless GOP develops a better plan to stop him. There's still a good chance he's stoppable, however.
NateSilver538	702864217435668480	2016-02-25T14:34:22	The average state poll conducted since South Carolina has Trump at 30.7%. Not much sign of momentum/consolidation yet.
NateSilver538	702736588149809152	2016-02-25T06:07:13	ForecasterEnten: You say Trump has a ceiling when almost 1 in 4.5 people in a key swing state is voting for him? Biased! Sad but true
NateSilver538	702683681132040192	2016-02-25T02:36:59	Ceiling metaphor may have outlived his usefulness. Point is that non-Trump voters are relatively anti-Trump. But he'll definitely get some!
NateSilver538	702681942874038272	2016-02-25T02:30:05	Trump's ceiling might be 50% or might be 65%.  It's very probably *not* 35%. Rubio's ceiling is higher than Trump's but his floor is lower.
NateSilver538	702681283353300992	2016-02-25T02:27:27	However, far more Republicans wouldn't consider voting Trump than is typical for a party nominee. He has relatively few "swing" voters.
NateSilver538	702680310539014144	2016-02-25T02:23:35	Trump's "ceiling" isn't what he's currently getting in polls. What he's getting in polls is more like his floor.

NateSilver538	702573412045213696	2016-02-24T19:18:49	If Rubio's not taking on Trump, maybe it's because he thinks he can take Cruz out on 3/1, fight Trump later. Dumb? Maybe. Risky? Definitely.
NateSilver538	702572464669388801	2016-02-24T19:15:03	Rubio's been catching up with and sometimes overtaking Cruz in more and more of these polls of the South.

NateSilver538	702144360754888704	2016-02-23T14:53:55	dandrezner: Whole point of The Party Decides is that Trump couldn't win because the party would stop him, not that he'd go away on his own.
NateSilver538	702136758771851264	2016-02-23T14:23:43	Trump should win Nevada, we think. But the VERY low turnout makes it a weird state. 
NateSilver538	702131806347227137	2016-02-23T14:04:02	Nevada may show Trump can win even with low turnout:  
NateSilver538	702029228628381696	2016-02-23T07:16:25	brandonenglish: Put another way, 3/15 is more of a drop-dead date than 3/1. But 3/1 will tell us a lot about 3/15 landscape.
NateSilver538	702027659438661632	2016-02-23T07:10:11	brandonenglish: If it's within 5 points then: 1) Rubio will win a lot of states and CDs 2) Trump-has-a-ceiling truthers are probably right.
NateSilver538	702026142388244480	2016-02-23T07:04:10	brandonenglish: If it's really Trump 35 / Rubio 30 on Mar. 1 -- which is possible but I don't expect -- Rubio is the more likely nominee.
NateSilver538	702024422669086722	2016-02-23T06:57:20	brandonenglish: Delegate haul for a candidate at 35% depends tremendously on how the other 65% splits up.
NateSilver538	702009789673504768	2016-02-23T05:59:11	DVNJr: Empirically they're good predictors but correlation ‚â† causality. Hard to say about this year because few GOP endorsements until now.
NateSilver538	702006334900858880	2016-02-23T05:45:27	There has been a change, however. Rubio's had more endorsements in the past 2 weeks than Bush had gotten all year. 
NateSilver538	702002526485401606	2016-02-23T05:30:19	e.g. - No candidate has lost after getting a post-IA endorsement surge like Rubio.  - No candidate has gotten one after winning so little.

NateSilver538	701210160048553985	2016-02-21T01:01:44	Now, Rubio might not gain enough to win. Or other candidates might not drop out soon enough. But it's a simple, highly defensible theory.
NateSilver538	701209286286909444	2016-02-21T00:58:16	Bullish case on Rubio is not complicated. It's that he'll gain as other candidates quit. Lots of data supports that. 
NateSilver538	701201871231389696	2016-02-21T00:28:48	This could wind up looking pretty good, although will probably wind up being a bit low on Cruz and Rubio.

NateSilver538	701174188887949313	2016-02-20T22:38:48	Bernie is 0-2 in caucuses so far -- and might win every state caucus from here on out. 
NateSilver538	701173765561049088	2016-02-20T22:37:07	We share nate_cohn skepticism about entrance poll finding that Clinton lost Hispanics in Nevada. 
NateSilver538	701169044527910912	2016-02-20T22:18:21	"Clinton held serve and remains the favorite ... Sanders is likely to keep her on her toes for some time to come." 
NateSilver538	701163040687964161	2016-02-20T21:54:30	Key question is who's overperforming in large, slow-to-report precincts. Could turn into a large-ish Clinton win or a narrow Sanders win.
NateSilver538	701162111448326144	2016-02-20T21:50:48	Current results would extrapolate to a 5-6% NV win for Clinton. Key word is extrapolate -- this is a rough estimate. 
NateSilver538	701158013571362817	2016-02-20T21:34:31	The Clark County numbers -- 71% of the Nevada's vote in 2008 -- look pretty good for Clinton.  
NateSilver538	701153907662266368	2016-02-20T21:18:13	So far appears that, as in 2008, Clinton doing well in Las Vegas and not as well in rest of Nevada. 
NateSilver538	701148338972991489	2016-02-20T20:56:05	Caucuses are dumb but especially dumb in Nevada, where they disenfranchise workers in the state's key industry. 
NateSilver538	701143819346165762	2016-02-20T20:38:07	Still, these entrance polls are based on a small and possibly non-representative sample. Not a lot of info here.
NateSilver538	701143570426818564	2016-02-20T20:37:08	Entrance polls flipped from showing a 3-point Clinton lead to a 2-point Sanders lead as more data was released. 
NateSilver538	701142855893577728	2016-02-20T20:34:18	Caucuses suck. 
NateSilver538	701138542362234880	2016-02-20T20:17:09	On the other hand, the last-minute Google search spike for Cruz and Rubio in South Carolina is pretty interesting. 
NateSilver538	701137538644320256	2016-02-20T20:13:10	Be really careful with those early entrance polls. Not intended for making projections. Weren't accurate in Iowa. 
NateSilver538	701122804889075712	2016-02-20T19:14:37	No Spinning A Nevada Loss For Clinton 
NateSilver538	701114145865867271	2016-02-20T18:40:13	It's FiveThirtyEight's Nevada and/or South Carolina liveblog! --&gt;

NateSilver538	700907673865363458	2016-02-20T04:59:46	So now Cruz and Rubio have nearly caught up to Trump in Google searches in SC. Small sample but was predictive-ish indicator in IA &amp; NH.
NateSilver538	700880137588338688	2016-02-20T03:10:21	Guy comes up to me in the lobby of the casino. "You do a fantastic job! You're the 539 guy, right?"
NateSilver538	700854694407634944	2016-02-20T01:29:15	Google searches in SC: Cruz, Rubio making up gap with Trump, although not as dramatic as in Iowa. No pulse for Bush. 
NateSilver538	700835652217270274	2016-02-20T00:13:35	GSW 73. 
NateSilver538	700818876511158272	2016-02-19T23:06:55	Relative to that forecast, I'd subtract a couple points from Kasich (nothing on the line) and add a couple to Cruz (good turnout operation).
NateSilver538	700817912366370817	2016-02-19T23:03:05	Our polls-plus forecast in SC. Bit more aggressive than poll avg: Trump 31 Rubio 20 Cruz 20 Jeb 11 Kasich 9 Carson 8 
NateSilver538	700787688211746816	2016-02-19T21:02:59	Put another way: Trump's got the most loyal base in the party, but if you're not with him at the start probably won't get on board later on.
NateSilver538	700787317481418754	2016-02-19T21:01:31	Also worth remembering that Trump did badly in IA and mediocrely in NH among late-deciders, per exit polls. So that might be a pattern.
NateSilver538	700781986072420352	2016-02-19T20:40:20	Our model tries to balance recency and pollster quality, which are at odds in SC. Late-breaking polls aren't always the most thorough ones.
NateSilver538	700780843917307904	2016-02-19T20:35:47	SC polling average: Trump 32.6 Cruz 18.9 Rubio 17.4 Bush 10.0 Kasich 8.3 Carson 7.1 
NateSilver538	700776637000916993	2016-02-19T20:19:04	We're running polling-based forecasts in Nevada:  Here's why you should mostly ignore them: 
NateSilver538	700773362637770752	2016-02-19T20:06:04	jonathanchait: I agree with you that poli-sci types can be too dismissive of chances for 3rd party. But don't think Bloomberg is right guy.
NateSilver538	700772271518973952	2016-02-19T20:01:43	Pundit class simultaneously thinks: 1) Trump/Sanders represent a populist revolt against technocratic elites 2) Mike Bloomberg is the answer
NateSilver538	700732463627120640	2016-02-19T17:23:32	JEB: Nothing has worked. He's toast, surely? But sometimes the guy who beats his polls is the last one you'd expect. 
NateSilver538	700732331389112320	2016-02-19T17:23:01	RUBIO: Media will overreact to whatever he does. What matters more: 1) knock Jeb! out 2) hit 20%+ on Super Tuesday. 
NateSilver538	700732080305475585	2016-02-19T17:22:01	CRUZ: SC demos suggest he may beat his polls -- and he probably needs to in order to have a viable delegate path. 
NateSilver538	700731896049762304	2016-02-19T17:21:17	TRUMP: Not quite a lock, crazy s*it happens in SC, but a heavy favorite. It matters if he wins with 41%, 34% or 27%. 
NateSilver538	700731737882566656	2016-02-19T17:20:39	Here's our final-ish South Carolina preview.

NateSilver538	700467981348777985	2016-02-18T23:52:35	"Throwing out" outlier polls, instead of averaging them, can actually bias your impressions of the race quite a bit. 
NateSilver538	700466980638191617	2016-02-18T23:48:36	How to think about seeming outlier polls: Including them in the average &gt; ignoring them &gt; obsessing over them
NateSilver538	700439303659323392	2016-02-18T21:58:38	Endorsement points since Iowa:  Rubio 47 Cruz 3 Carson 1 (!) Bush 0 Kasich 0 Trump 0 
NateSilver538	700436226508263425	2016-02-18T21:46:24	The idea of a growing rift between Clinton/Sanders supporters continues not to hold much traction with actual voters 
NateSilver538	700432891734552576	2016-02-18T21:33:09	Within GOP, Catholics are overrepresented in winner-take-all &amp; take-most states. Could be building block for Rubio. 
NateSilver538	700432137955188737	2016-02-18T21:30:09	Remember when Catholics were swing voters? Actually, they still are. Catholics went 50-48 for Obama in 2012. 
NateSilver538	700431610907389954	2016-02-18T21:28:04	Among Republicans, 56% have a favorable view of Pope Francis, and 21% an unfavorable view: 
NateSilver538	700405749537710080	2016-02-18T19:45:18	Our model's like "no idea what's going on in Nevada why are you making me forecast this".  
NateSilver538	700390626068713474	2016-02-18T18:45:12	DanFosterType: Depends on how divided the field is. 35% can get you a LOT of delegates if it's the plurality. Not so many in 2/3-way race.
NateSilver538	700389742320476165	2016-02-18T18:41:41	BTW, there are a LOT of Catholics in states like NJ, WI, PA, NY that vote later on, many of which are winner-take-all or take-most. (5/)
NateSilver538	700389524808069121	2016-02-18T18:40:49	Alienating those GOP swing voters (a lot of Catholics are likely in that group) and doubling down on his base is a risky long-run plan. (4/)
NateSilver538	700388974464995329	2016-02-18T18:38:38	Trump needs to get from his 25-35% base to 51% at some point. Large % of GOP voters have ruled him out. Not many "swing voters" left. (3/)
NateSilver538	700388707069730816	2016-02-18T18:37:35	True, not a lot of Catholics in South Carolina or on Super Tuesday. Could help Trump there? But that's missing the bigger picture. (2/)
NateSilver538	700388524835655680	2016-02-18T18:36:51	The quickly-congealing "pope feud will actually help Trump!!!" conventional wisdom is a little superficial IMO. (1/)
NateSilver538	700382657620877313	2016-02-18T18:13:32	This will make you question your understanding of reality. (Don't worry it's about gravitational waves not Trump.)

NateSilver538	700361385281253380	2016-02-18T16:49:00	SC polls conducted entirely after the GOP debate have Trump at ~33% on average, versus more like ~36% before:

NateSilver538	700078664134881280	2016-02-17T22:05:35	In fact, being willing to publish an occasional outlier is laudable. A sign a pollster is being honest with you.

NateSilver538	700043570577854466	2016-02-17T19:46:08	Nevada should be a Clinton-leaning state, no matter how much her campaign spins. Would be a big win for Bernie.

NateSilver538	700034237144109057	2016-02-17T19:09:02	chrislhayes TheStalwart: Yeah, agree. Also, Trump burned a few of his remaining bridges with the party elite in last week's debate.
NateSilver538	700033611211399168	2016-02-17T19:06:33	Noteworthy that we're NOT seeing those "party elites think Trump's not so bad!" stories, as we were before Iowa.

NateSilver538	699604391234576384	2016-02-16T14:40:59	Still some signs that Trump has a lowish ceiling. Only 50% favorability in this SC poll, tied with Rubio 1-on-1. 
NateSilver538	699595174809186312	2016-02-16T14:04:22	This should be fun today. 3:30pm.

NateSilver538	699428458858987520	2016-02-16T03:01:54	Seems like Trump will get 25-35% almost no matter what, depending on the state. Question is: can GOP contain his numbers within that range?
NateSilver538	699412218266394624	2016-02-16T01:57:21	If you see something that looks buggy in the numbers ... drop us a line. Even something minor -- they're the hardest things to catch.
NateSilver538	699412038058164224	2016-02-16T01:56:38	As a technical aside, a buggy line of code was causing the model to underweight some post-NH polls. Made almost no difference but fixed now.
NateSilver538	699411399454433280	2016-02-16T01:54:06	Trump could decline, but there's not really anyone running a close 2nd. Cruz/Rubio increasing gap with Bush/Kasich, however.

NateSilver538	698727450751193089	2016-02-14T04:36:20	Some quick thoughts on tonight's debate: 
NateSilver538	698699015517552641	2016-02-14T02:43:21	GWB is also still really popular with Republicans. 
NateSilver538	698697893688053760	2016-02-14T02:38:53	The Iraq War is still popular with Republicans. 62% favor, 28% oppose. 
NateSilver538	698689552408571904	2016-02-14T02:05:44	An increased focused on "values" issues could hurt Trump. But more focus on "electability" might not. 
NateSilver538	698682142444879873	2016-02-14T01:36:18	We're liveblogging the Republican debate, which might be the most important one yet:

NateSilver538	697503928724942848	2016-02-10T19:34:30	Not a big fan of lumping delegates and superdelegates together. Super Ds can switch and some will if it looks like Bernie has a mandate.
NateSilver538	697484572657917953	2016-02-10T18:17:35	Rubio's bounced back a bit in betting markets since last night, maybe based on people realizing other "establishment" candidates even worse?
NateSilver538	697431101082628096	2016-02-10T14:45:06	Jeb has spent almost $100m so far. Got 3% in IA and 11% in NH. But magically he'll beat Trump if he gets it 1-on-1?

NateSilver538	697257940760338432	2016-02-10T03:17:02	We need more polls of Nevada and South Carolina. Nothing since December in NV, nothing since Iowa in SC. 
NateSilver538	697256520573030401	2016-02-10T03:11:23	Okay political scientists, let's dispel with this fiction that Donald Trump doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing.
NateSilver538	697247699410804737	2016-02-10T02:36:20	I get why Jeb is up in prediction markets tonight, but still -- dude got just 11% of the vote.

NateSilver538	697238247773204481	2016-02-10T01:58:46	Welp, it's been a pretty good for the pollsters at least. 
NateSilver538	697235637309673472	2016-02-10T01:48:24	Cruz and Rubio did even worse on this question, though! Time for Mitt Romney? 
NateSilver538	697235524780695552	2016-02-10T01:47:57	Great night for Trump, but still amazing that only 48% of NH Republicans would be happy with him as their nominee. 
NateSilver538	697230240196784128	2016-02-10T01:26:57	Tonight is *much* worse for the Republican "establishment" than the Democratic one.

NateSilver538	697176713231470592	2016-02-09T21:54:16	Exit polls often miss late surprises as much as pre-election polls do. In Iowa last week, for instance.

NateSilver538	697144774629969925	2016-02-09T19:47:21	People keep putting Rubio in the "establishment lane" like he's Bush-Christie-Kasich, but it doesn't quite fit. He's too conservative

NateSilver538	697128034168655874	2016-02-09T18:40:50	That applies mostly to the GOP side. A 6-way race is *much* harder to poll accurately than a 2-way race. 
NateSilver538	697127889125376000	2016-02-09T18:40:15	New Hampshire forecast: mostly cloudy, high chance of polling miscues.

NateSilver538	696882647147114496	2016-02-09T02:25:45	Rubio stunk in the debate, but a candidate stumbling over/repeating a line in a stump speech is totally normal. Not worthy of much coverage.

NateSilver538	696852942389932032	2016-02-09T00:27:43	One theory is that Christie's failure to go after Trump was a big mistake. 
NateSilver538	696852358421200896	2016-02-09T00:25:23	Don't totally get why Christie is at 6% here in NH. Good in debates, town halls. Has flaws but every candidate does. 
NateSilver538	696824656112783360	2016-02-08T22:35:19	Also possible: 3. Rubio will get like 16% despite debate, but he would have gotten 21% with a good debate.
NateSilver538	696823907697958913	2016-02-08T22:32:20	Both these things can be true: 1. New polls don't tell us that much about Rubio debate 2. Pundits have oversold importance of Rubio debate
NateSilver538	696800440198045696	2016-02-08T20:59:05	Trump below 30% in our NH polling average for the first time in awhile. Still no one all that close to him, however.

NateSilver538	696416361019527169	2016-02-07T19:32:53	Fair to say: there's been a lack of substantive coverage of Rubio. Also true of Kasich, Cruz, most non-Trump candidates.
NateSilver538	696416048501944320	2016-02-07T19:31:39	Not sure I buy idea that Rubio's gotten great media coverage. Anything other than Trump's dominance of coverage is a second-order effect.
NateSilver538	696367179701346305	2016-02-07T16:17:28	Trump was already gaining slightly and Rubio falling slightly in our forecast even before last night.

NateSilver538	696170421058674688	2016-02-07T03:15:37	But temper that with: pundits' reaction to the debate not always a great match for voters at home: 
NateSilver538	696170050542309376	2016-02-07T03:14:08	Keep in mind: last minute changes in NH are as much the rule as the exception.

NateSilver538	696078820726738944	2016-02-06T21:11:38	Some of Bernie's success among 18-29s also because they've seen lots of progress under Obama. Makes Clinton's "change is hard" a tough sell.

NateSilver538	696053320306315264	2016-02-06T19:30:18	Chris Christie has lost half his support in New Hampshire. Maybe he should have taken on Donald Trump:

NateSilver538	696026296309129217	2016-02-06T17:42:55	After Sanders rally, found this anti-Bernie flier on our car. Paid for by Hillary For America. Oddly Trivial stuff. 
NateSilver538	696012070492495872	2016-02-06T16:46:23	If you're shocked Bernie is doing so well among young people, remember how much public policy panders to old people.

NateSilver538	695770927376814080	2016-02-06T00:48:10	But you also get great questions like from the guy who just asked Cruz about overprescription of opiods at VA hospitals.

NateSilver538	694906679591321600	2016-02-03T15:33:57	Why Iowa changed the odds so much: 
NateSilver538	694685881572134914	2016-02-03T00:56:35	In primaries, usually worth it to poll until the bitter end. DMR poll and others missed late movement in Iowa. 
NateSilver538	694640768481370112	2016-02-02T21:57:19	"Trump 22 percent, Rubio 21, Kasich 18, Cruz 17 or something in that vicinity is an entirely plausible outcome" 
NateSilver538	694640096021221376	2016-02-02T21:54:39	And yet ... it's not that easy to outline a path where Cruz gets to 50% + 1 delegates. 
NateSilver538	694639850000113664	2016-02-02T21:53:40	Betting markets give Ted Cruz just a 13 percent chance of the GOP nomination. We think that's too low.

NateSilver538	694589630298091521	2016-02-02T18:34:07	By the heuristic "pick the candidate whose chances the other party's supporters on Twitter are hot-taking against", GOP should pick Rubio.
NateSilver538	694585549659725825	2016-02-02T18:17:54	Iowa was not just some random setback for Trump. It was the first time people actually voted.

NateSilver538	694176536908427264	2016-02-01T15:12:38	Is Iowa a "must win" for Trump? I'm wary of any such proclamations. But it's pretty damn important for him. 
NateSilver538	694174508303917058	2016-02-01T15:04:34	Iowa: - Low turnout. - Strange rules. - Demographically non-representative. So why's it matter so much? 
NateSilver538	694155563358359552	2016-02-01T13:49:17	Rubio has gained about 4 points in our polling average in the past week. So, momentum claims are somewhat justified. 
NateSilver538	694000151761915904	2016-02-01T03:31:44	Iowa polling average: Trump 28.9 Cruz 23.8 Rubio 15.3 
NateSilver538	693993916840939520	2016-02-01T03:06:58	Polling in Iowa is a rough gig. A 3-way tie is entirely plausible. So is Trump winning by 20.
NateSilver538	693993592268967936	2016-02-01T03:05:40	With that said, any data is useful at this point. Other than Selzer &amp; OpinionSavvy, everyone left the field a little early.

NateSilver538	690282714709278720	2016-01-21T21:19:58	For instance, the CNN poll implies a turnout of about 320K in the Iowa GOP caucus, versus ~120K in 2012.
NateSilver538	690282247363117066	2016-01-21T21:18:07	A lot of differences in these polls are based on how tightly polls are screening voters. Looser screens help Bernie &amp; Trump.

NateSilver538	690212824593887232	2016-01-21T16:42:15	GOP lobbyists want Trump to win nomination because they think he'll lose general election?  
NateSilver538	690204287377526784	2016-01-21T16:08:20	Big caution, though: we're seeing some pretty big differences in the Democratic polls. Actually way bigger differences than on the GOP side.

NateSilver538	689915738992295936	2016-01-20T21:01:44	Maybe GOP thinks they can sink Cruz &amp; deal with Trump later. That'd be a safer bet if Rubio/Kasich/Christie/Bush weren't so logjammed.
