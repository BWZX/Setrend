randal_olson	712615139414028290	2016-03-23T12:21:03	OliverSherouse I don't understand the modern scientist's fascination with "novel" research.
randal_olson	712615056555581440	2016-03-23T12:20:43	OliverSherouse I would say that most published research is incremental, and not really all that novel. And that's okay -- that's science.
randal_olson	712614935805763584	2016-03-23T12:20:15	OliverSherouse Personally, I won't be convinced if a writer just tells me that their work is novel. Honestly, it's unlikely.
randal_olson	712614357247606786	2016-03-23T12:17:57	OliverSherouse Shouldn't be necessary if you write a good intro/related work section.
randal_olson	712613744518545409	2016-03-23T12:15:31	bio_mediocre IMO it should go the other way: If work is not novel, clarify that it's a reproducibility study.

randal_olson	684490262379282432	2016-01-05T21:42:50	.AlexCEngler rasbt therriaultphd But what about taking the combined set and dividing it into several training/holdout sets? (2/2)
randal_olson	684489940625821697	2016-01-05T21:41:33	.AlexCEngler rasbt therriaultphd Agree -- important to have final holdout set that feature engineering, model, etc. never saw. (1/2)
randal_olson	684482446469906432	2016-01-05T21:11:46	.thmosqueiro My concern is that the holdout set may be a "lucky" division of the data. Is it "right" to report perf on only 1 holdout set?
randal_olson	684481194243706880	2016-01-05T21:06:48	therriaultphd Some others suggested here -- perform 10-fold CV on training only, then report performance on the holdout set.
randal_olson	684481006976380928	2016-01-05T21:06:03	gregstod Yes -- testing performance of a model.
randal_olson	684479536340185089	2016-01-05T21:00:13	thmosqueiro That was my thought -- 
randal_olson	684477941992955904	2016-01-05T20:53:53	My thought is to merge the training/testing sets then split that into 10 folds, but then you can't compare to previous work on the data set.
randal_olson	684477714430951424	2016-01-05T20:52:58	Thoughts? If you have a MachineLearning dataset that's divided into training/testing for CV, but you want to do 10-fold CV, what do you do?
