jandawson	725795621123186688	2016-04-28T21:15:35	Looks like the reason for that drop in reported AWS margins is down to including stock-based compensation from this quarter on

jandawson	725436984022310912	2016-04-27T21:30:29	Thanks to iansherr, I have my answer on FB employee numbers.  
jandawson	725436704564203520	2016-04-27T21:29:22	iansherr thanks! Feels about right. alexeheath – yours feels high. Last q was 12.7k
jandawson	725436104460013569	2016-04-27T21:26:59	Anyone seen/heard an employee number from Facebook yet?
jandawson	725435914927767552	2016-04-27T21:26:14	iankar_ kerrymflynn yes, Twitter has been periscoping for two quarters now, I think.
jandawson	725435713747976192	2016-04-27T21:25:26	iansherr yes. Don’t envy whoever has that job.
jandawson	725435295106093056	2016-04-27T21:23:46	iankar_ yep. Worth noting that Netflix more or less does this, and Twitter has been moving this way recently.
jandawson	725435003258068992	2016-04-27T21:22:37	Yes please. So tedious to hear stuff we all already know and could have read in report. 
jandawson	725434885783965696	2016-04-27T21:22:09	eringriffith jank0 which is odd, since 1 extra day in context of ~90 is closer to 1% than 2%…
jandawson	725433405102387200	2016-04-27T21:16:16	Facebook talking up success with small and medium sized businesses as advertisers – winning them is one of Twitter’s biggest challenges

jandawson	725432529474351104	2016-04-27T21:12:47	KurtWagner8 that was the Instagram feed, actually, which currently isn’t controlled or filtered by FB
jandawson	725432441142308864	2016-04-27T21:12:26	Tricky thing about Instagram is that usage isn’t included in MAUs but revenue is included in ARPU, artificially inflating it.
jandawson	725432291820892160	2016-04-27T21:11:50	At what point does FB feel the need to break out Instagram revenue numbers separately? Seems certain to be a big part of recent ARPU growth

jandawson	725421898268446722	2016-04-27T20:30:32	Facebook made over $15 billion from mobile ad revenue alone in the past year. Another ~$4bn from non-mobile ads 
jandawson	725421500170276864	2016-04-27T20:28:57	Still a significant gap between how often FB users are active between regions – Asia last by far. But all rising.

jandawson	725103806699073536	2016-04-26T23:26:33	crockpotveggies short term they’re suffering from the year on year comp and should recover. Longer term mkt forces make growth tough

jandawson	725086921958035456	2016-04-26T22:19:28	BenBajarin and you end up having the same conversation with several people at once. This could help with both of those
jandawson	725086852303069184	2016-04-26T22:19:11	BenBajarin does look interesting. Big problem with Twitter is you take over people’s timeline if you tweet a lot.
jandawson	725086722871169024	2016-04-26T22:18:40	film_girl I think just approaching her directly with an offer would be better than a campaign.

jandawson	725085939534430208	2016-04-26T22:15:34	film_girl looks like the current holder is at least still tweeting occasionally. I think that reduces your claim for the handle
jandawson	725082730862510080	2016-04-26T22:02:49	firesideconf agreed. Although it started last quarter to a lesser extent. More humility, but still optimism about the long term
jandawson	725081677236596737	2016-04-26T21:58:37	Tim Cook basically just talked through my post from last night – iPhone 6 took Apple off its prior trajectory 
jandawson	725080896471220225	2016-04-26T21:55:31	iansherr ampressman ShiraOvide Here’s the past 2 years. Best was -8% when it comes to revenues (-9% in shipments) 
jandawson	725079995098353665	2016-04-26T21:51:56	iansherr ShiraOvide so all this says is that the year on year comparison will be better, i.e. lower than 9% shrinkage. Doesn’t say growth
jandawson	725079904442703872	2016-04-26T21:51:35	iansherr ShiraOvide yes, to put it bluntly. :)  “Compare” means comparison versus prior year. It’s been shrinking by 9% or more.
jandawson	725079739224850432	2016-04-26T21:50:55	As Cook mentioned on last quarter’s call, “Greater China” weakness is about HK far more than the mainland. Sell through China down just 5%
jandawson	725078947633975298	2016-04-26T21:47:47	sixcolorsevent film_girl point was more that product didn’t actually help growth and yet depressed margins and ASPs – won’t this?
jandawson	725078566774304768	2016-04-26T21:46:16	iansherr ShiraOvide haha – I interpreted it the opposite way!
jandawson	725078513355644928	2016-04-26T21:46:03	iansherr ShiraOvide Cook just appeared to reiterate the “best iPad compare” line, FWIW
jandawson	725078103261863936	2016-04-26T21:44:25	PatrickMoorhead it’s an interesting idea, especially given the recent hire from Box. Seems to be an area of investment
jandawson	725077959342698497	2016-04-26T21:43:51	marshray yep.
jandawson	725076308930256896	2016-04-26T21:37:17	AAPLTree if the asset is overseas. Otherwise, no. But that’s where some of their borrowing comes in.
jandawson	725076055896150016	2016-04-26T21:36:17	iansherr ShiraOvide haha. Fair enough. I don’t have access to any transcript at this point so you have the advantage here
jandawson	725075008041558016	2016-04-26T21:32:07	Interesting to hear Cook say that not only will Apple stay active in M&amp;A, it’s very open to acquiring something larger than in the past
jandawson	725073663477747712	2016-04-26T21:26:47	jank0 ASP &lt; half Apple Watch, and likely selling in far smaller numbers.
jandawson	725072803100262402	2016-04-26T21:23:22	mgsiegler fmanjoo yeah, timing on that story was pretty bad – hit right before iPhone started going gangbusters in Japan...
jandawson	725072512711856129	2016-04-26T21:22:12	GokulBhargav right – buying older phones, lower storage etc.
jandawson	725072420080513024	2016-04-26T21:21:50	fmanjoo it’s had a funky counter-cyclical thing going on with Apple for the last couple of years – down last year, rebounding now.
jandawson	725071831867121664	2016-04-26T21:19:30	The iPhone 6 blip was particularly marked in China, which skyrocketed and has since fallen to earth dramatically 
jandawson	725070637341921281	2016-04-26T21:14:45	iansherr I thought he said best year on year compare in 2 years, not first increase. (i.e. better than 9% decline, not growth)
jandawson	725070378888916992	2016-04-26T21:13:44	fromedome big question is whether it returns to growth once it gets iPhone 6 out of its system later this year
jandawson	725070151175929856	2016-04-26T21:12:49	caro_milanesi premise is flawed regardless – big iPad Pro was never going to be a huge seller relative to iPad in total.
jandawson	725070024340164608	2016-04-26T21:12:19	Cook suggests iPad will see best year on year trend in 2 years in June quarter. Best during last 2 years was -9%, so there’s that.
jandawson	725069281113825281	2016-04-26T21:09:22	Tim Cook: Apple Watch unit sales met expectations. Seasonality will resemble iPod. Sales will be focused around holidays.
jandawson	725068781832310784	2016-04-26T21:07:23	Tim: Apple's first subscription business. -- note he said FIRST
jandawson	725069328052158464	2016-04-26T21:09:33	CaffeineAndHate Skylake is out now, hence new MacBook. We should see the rest of the line updated over coming months too
jandawson	725068970076704768	2016-04-26T21:08:08	Mac is likely suffering from the fact that the whole line was overdue for an update until MacBook was updated recently. Should change soon
jandawson	725068811733344256	2016-04-26T21:07:30	caro_milanesi 12.9% version was on sale for full quarter, though, and has much higher ASP. I think that’s what (some) people have in mind
jandawson	725068575375945728	2016-04-26T21:06:34	Cook says more Android switchers in last 6 mths than any other 6 months ever, which points to much lower upgrades as the big problem
jandawson	725068288330354688	2016-04-26T21:05:25	film_girl talked about this last quarter too – basically full price paid for services (iTunes, App Store etc) vs net sales reported in GAAP
jandawson	725066787541262336	2016-04-26T20:59:27	abdophoto to some extent. I’d still be really surprised if there aren’t some noticeable visual differences in September.
jandawson	725066549854277632	2016-04-26T20:58:31	abdophoto then add the fact that new installment plan model in the US incentivizes keeping phone longer, and you have a perfect storm
jandawson	725066472674840577	2016-04-26T20:58:12	abdophoto I think it’s broader than just that – people are happy with the phone they have. Dissatisfaction no longer a driver of upgrades
jandawson	725066292277956608	2016-04-26T20:57:29	Here’s Apple’s big problem visualized – all three major product lines now underwater year on year 
jandawson	725065169806618624	2016-04-26T20:53:02	Big dip in iPhone ASPs, and that’s before the iPhone SE went on sale… 
jandawson	725062816802181121	2016-04-26T20:43:41	A word is missing from Apple's press release title today. 
jandawson	725063294038474758	2016-04-26T20:45:34	Problem for Apple is that other things (notably Mac) are also shrinking – very little to offset the shrinkage.
jandawson	725063135934062592	2016-04-26T20:44:57	Fairly ugly set of results from Apple. But iPhone sales were in line with what I said yesterday, which isn’t so bad 
jandawson	725059727927971845	2016-04-26T20:31:24	Uh oh 
jandawson	725059141929078784	2016-04-26T20:29:05	PatrickMoorhead I haven’t tried using them, no. But they know far less about users than FB (which is a critical issue)
jandawson	725057563381870592	2016-04-26T20:22:48	Once again though, most of the wireless gains came from prepaid phones, connected cars and non-phone devices. 
jandawson	725058416163602432	2016-04-26T20:26:12	Translation: “we think our products are really good, but we don’t seem to have convinced marketers of that yet” 
jandawson	724994324966989824	2016-04-26T16:11:31	charlesarthur haha. Bet kids would be quite good at pressing *1 as quickly as possible. Nimble fingers and all that…
jandawson	724993812188172288	2016-04-26T16:09:29	charlesarthur yep. Have to slowly figure out what age will trigger skepticism by the authorities. Will start with 10yo and work down…
jandawson	724992331007430659	2016-04-26T16:03:36	charlesarthur great idea! I discovered when I did my taxes recently that payments to my children for such work are tax deductible…
jandawson	724991712137900035	2016-04-26T16:01:08	kifleswing haha.

jandawson	724986621230116865	2016-04-26T15:40:54	Of course, the full picture of my afternoon looks like this – should be some actual fun before the earnings madness 
jandawson	724984791745986560	2016-04-26T15:33:38	RogerEntner probably would have killed me…

jandawson	724972093171888128	2016-04-26T14:43:10	abdophoto count me in. Not worth the risks.
jandawson	724949916787703808	2016-04-26T13:15:03	jameswester familiarity with tech for linking to a file seems a little less advanced on that first tweet…

jandawson	720473706896744448	2016-04-14T04:48:12	I’ve been skeptical of this claim already. Even more so now. Good chance Sprint reports positive adds too

jandawson	720338266281521156	2016-04-13T19:50:00	It’s clearer all the time that new technologies don’t make the old problems (e.g. communication overload) go away. They just move them.

jandawson	720258220187475968	2016-04-13T14:31:56	seuj yes. So much that’s not working right at this point with these bots.
jandawson	720257832084353024	2016-04-13T14:30:23	seuj Easily fixed. But more interesting / problematic is that these bots take one contact as license to spam indefinitely, with no opt in
jandawson	720257541586812928	2016-04-13T14:29:14	seuj Exactly. Seems like it's been the standard way to do this in past UIs...

jandawson	717736142154510336	2016-04-06T15:30:05	benthompson sorry, I meant iWork, not Office.
jandawson	717736044548886528	2016-04-06T15:29:42	benthompson saji the iWork apps are just so much easier for producing good-looking stuff. And I don’t use most sophisticated features
jandawson	717735821709746176	2016-04-06T15:28:49	benthompson On OS X, it’s not an issue – iCloud files work seamlessly with Dropbox. But on iOS, it’s a two-way export/import process
jandawson	717735699294760960	2016-04-06T15:28:20	benthompson I know – the little round Dropbox icon pops up at the right of the screen every time I use Office.
jandawson	717734799994015744	2016-04-06T15:24:45	benthompson well, yes, that or just adopting iCloud. I’m resistant to both because I’m heavily invested in both iWork and Dropbox.
jandawson	717733281588846592	2016-04-06T15:18:43	SumocatS yeah, again, that’s a one-time process. I need something that just seamlessly syncs constantly.

jandawson	717733080434257920	2016-04-06T15:17:55	This gets at something I hinted at here –  Making apps hideable is first step but not endgame 
jandawson	717731817709637632	2016-04-06T15:12:54	The obvious answer here is “use iCloud” but I’m just not sure I trust it yet for critical files.  
jandawson	717731673979289600	2016-04-06T15:12:20	SumocatS in other words, this is a one-way process, not one that you can keep going with over time. It’s fine on OS X, but not on iOS
jandawson	717731551673384960	2016-04-06T15:11:51	SumocatS this is only a partial solution. It tells you how to get files from iWork into Dropbox etc. but not how to edit them there

jandawson	714479340881186816	2016-03-28T15:48:43	abdophoto yeah, though doing demos at scale is still tough. Think Apple Watch try-on process x100. More space and time-consuming.
jandawson	714479224132775936	2016-03-28T15:48:16	That’s why I think smartphone-based VR at ~$100 is incredibly powerful, especially once content catches up to hardware and as hw improves

jandawson	714476582178414592	2016-03-28T15:37:46	abdophoto that’s why I think it was a misstep. Should have either refreshed it at $499 or kept it at $499 until refresh this fall.
jandawson	714476071761027072	2016-03-28T15:35:44	abdophoto that’s my worry here – feels like Apple may be pulling the plug a little too early on some stuff, before new stuff is ready

jandawson	714475679660658689	2016-03-28T15:34:11	HarshilShah1910 in the case of Twitter, it’s now obvious you can turn the algorithm off, which basically removes the negative impact
jandawson	714475383853162497	2016-03-28T15:33:00	abdophoto and yet will sell in much smaller numbers than Air for years to come if they invest in Air. Otherwise, iPad sales drop fast.
jandawson	714475165099237376	2016-03-28T15:32:08	HarshilShah1910 My point is both Twitter and IG’s changes are hated because misunderstood. If messaged properly, could avoid a lot of hate
jandawson	714475053337841664	2016-03-28T15:31:41	abdophoto Feels like an abandoned product at that point. That was my big worry about last week’s event.
jandawson	714474456702263296	2016-03-28T15:29:19	abdophoto That doesn’t feel like it’ll be justifiable – there just won’t be $200 of difference between iPad Air and Pro then, I expect
jandawson	714474353455312900	2016-03-28T15:28:54	abdophoto I could see it either way. Lowering price now was a mistake if that’s the plan. But $200 price differential for new Air in Fall?
jandawson	714474030045069312	2016-03-28T15:27:37	HarshilShah1910 in large part, in both cases, because the story got out there in ways that distorted the truth because cos. didn’t tell it
jandawson	714472975118966784	2016-03-28T15:23:26	Really feels like both Instagram and Twitter have screwed up the messaging around their recent big changes. Big backlash to both unnecessary
jandawson	714464033278038016	2016-03-28T14:47:54	Judahe that's been my assumption too. People are likely overreacting. But an indication of poor messaging on IG's part.
jandawson	714463050405847040	2016-03-28T14:43:59	Microsoft has to demonstrate that it’s building momentum.    Jandawson looks ahead to Build for subscribers. ($)
jandawson	714463222519046145	2016-03-28T14:44:40	This looks like it's going to be a mess. Unless of course they preserve the option to see all posts chronologically

jandawson	713458588694384640	2016-03-25T20:12:37	nkulw it’s not only not opt-in, but Netflix didn’t even disclose it was doing this, and discriminated by network but not by plan.

jandawson	713391119699030018	2016-03-25T15:44:31	The “Apple News is open to everyone” change is a lot less meaningful when you still have to wait days for approval…

jandawson	713231855701467136	2016-03-25T05:11:40	JSchwarz9 just makes assumptions that don't hold up
jandawson	713225686941454336	2016-03-25T04:47:09	JSchwarz9 I don't know if it's that high to begin with. And even on limited data if you watch one show you're not going to blow thru 20GB

jandawson	713224815226687488	2016-03-25T04:43:41	JSchwarz9 how would Netflix know? They generalized based on networks but there's no 100% correlation
jandawson	713223739970748416	2016-03-25T04:39:25	JSchwarz9 if I'm on an AT&amp;T or Verizon unlimited plan, how is this in my best interest? No notification, no user choice, blanket policy

jandawson	713208351576883201	2016-03-25T03:38:16	JasonAbbruzzese they claim it's about the fact those networks have mostly capped data plans.

jandawson	713207618152505344	2016-03-25T03:35:21	rjonesy FCC doesn't really regulate app makers. Net neutrality applies to network owners.
jandawson	713206930399834113	2016-03-25T03:32:37	JasonAbbruzzese it's bizarrely paternalistic on Netflix's part.
jandawson	713206748094418945	2016-03-25T03:31:54	JasonAbbruzzese it's up to customers to use video services responsibly, not video providers to make value judgements on their behalf
jandawson	713206566833369092	2016-03-25T03:31:10	rjonesy Variety not sure they could except in a PR sense.
jandawson	713206485128335360	2016-03-25T03:30:51	sciwizam that's probably it. Was great (can't imagine how painful it would be to enter password etc in VR). But weird too.
jandawson	713205754455396353	2016-03-25T03:27:57	This is insane 
jandawson	713195905822760960	2016-03-25T02:48:49	ZOCall this is the speaker list: 
jandawson	713176471716495360	2016-03-25T01:31:35	thyechean BenBajarin yes, that's odd.
jandawson	713176348961873921	2016-03-25T01:31:06	KeithMcCurdy yes, today.
jandawson	713168335358337026	2016-03-25T00:59:15	Bill Somerville now speaking at TEDxBYU - inspiring stuff. Small grants awarded with minimal process to communities 
jandawson	713142484663201792	2016-03-24T23:16:32	Attending TEDxBYU tonight - should be a fun event. 
jandawson	713108426507706369	2016-03-24T21:01:12	getwired BenBajarin yes. One of the things that makes HTC Vive intriguing. And of course AR more broadly.
jandawson	713107642835546113	2016-03-24T20:58:05	BenBajarin yes. Very weird. This is the problem with creating real-world environments including seating space. Another uncanny valley
jandawson	713106867451396096	2016-03-24T20:55:00	ShawnKing that’s probably a blessing…. :)
jandawson	713106034345136129	2016-03-24T20:51:42	Part of what prompted this was using the Hulu VR app today – look down and just a weird shadow/stain on couch… 
jandawson	713102695813353473	2016-03-24T20:38:26	At the very least, a great way to experiment within limits before committing to something bigger 
jandawson	713101997893939200	2016-03-24T20:35:39	Bingo. The question is, is that just a short-term strategy before a broader assault? 
jandawson	713100982528282624	2016-03-24T20:31:37	rjonesy Neither “wrong body” nor no body are great, tbh. But this’ll get fixed in time. Interactivity likely to come with it
jandawson	713100588414672897	2016-03-24T20:30:03	One of the weirdest things about lots of today’s VR experiences is the disembodied feeling. Look down where your body should be and… nothing
jandawson	713100232662200320	2016-03-24T20:28:38	Apple’s original video content continues to be closely tied to subject matter of its other business – music &amp; apps 
jandawson	713086709202755584	2016-03-24T19:34:54	mobile_reach brianshall BenBajarin I don’t. This was a while back and was a high-level survey. Ben likely has more
jandawson	713079710377357312	2016-03-24T19:07:05	Really not good for a company that holds itself up as a security leader 
jandawson	713077316235042816	2016-03-24T18:57:35	amir Weird. Still shows up embedded in my tweet: 
jandawson	713059810753662976	2016-03-24T17:48:01	Awkward Instagram username from Apple's FileMaker team... 
jandawson	713053746712805376	2016-03-24T17:23:55	Redbox Plans to Launch New Streaming Service ‘Redbox Digital’ (Exclusive)  via Variety
jandawson	713043403177484288	2016-03-24T16:42:49	djbressler neilcybart she doesn’t know – just presents a list of web links (none of which have the answer either)
jandawson	713041931517820928	2016-03-24T16:36:58	brianshall BenBajarin as I said, roughly half. Might be slightly less. But quite a few as Netflix equivalent
jandawson	713041569549422592	2016-03-24T16:35:32	BenBajarin when I’ve done surveys, it’s apparent that ~half Prime subscribers buy it for the shipping, half for video. Many use both
jandawson	713038699034882048	2016-03-24T16:24:08	neilcybart and yet Pro label means it’s not as explicit as either and doesn’t suggest you can’t also (or only) use it for Netflix
jandawson	713038598937792512	2016-03-24T16:23:44	neilcybart I feel like we’ve got down a rabbit hole here. Whether it’s professional or productivity, it isn’t Netflix.
jandawson	713038404351471616	2016-03-24T16:22:57	treehcapital fair enough. I generally try to believe the best of people, but after a while as patterns emerge it gets harder.
jandawson	713038101912756224	2016-03-24T16:21:45	neilcybart haha. Mac Professional presumably didn’t sound great either :)
jandawson	713037933557600262	2016-03-24T16:21:05	treehcapital Steve Jobs may have been rude and nasty, but owned it. Fadell wants to have it both ways – act badly but be thought of better
jandawson	713037752619503616	2016-03-24T16:20:22	treehcapital it’s a wonderful sentiment. Just seems to fly in the face of much of the evidence about how he actually behaves as a manager
jandawson	713036306004070401	2016-03-24T16:14:37	neilcybart that suggests larger size, though, as with the iPhone line. with both Air and Pro at 9.7” that doesn’t work.
jandawson	713036179487064066	2016-03-24T16:14:07	Weirdest thing about Netflix app on Gear VR was that it logged me in automatically on a Galaxy S7 where I had never used Netflix.
jandawson	713036040504651776	2016-03-24T16:13:34	I know some people (including Bajarin) love the Netflix app already – nice to have Hulu there too 
jandawson	713035709003595776	2016-03-24T16:12:15	treehcapital indeed – very different flavor from the Information article everyone is reading today: 
jandawson	713035405839323137	2016-03-24T16:11:02	neilcybart standard definition of pro is abbreviation for professional. Never used as abbreviation for productivity 
jandawson	713035261085487106	2016-03-24T16:10:28	neilcybart I think of productivity as almost exclusively about my work – doesn’t encompass entertainment, leisure activities
jandawson	713034906796863488	2016-03-24T16:09:03	neilcybart and I’m not saying that either. But clear that they see it as distinct from iPad Air, and getting work done is part of that
jandawson	713034563052634112	2016-03-24T16:07:42	treehcapital at it again now.
jandawson	713034538880864256	2016-03-24T16:07:36	treehcapital see my earlier tweets - last time a negative story about Fadell came out, defense was to RT nice things others said
jandawson	713034379832852480	2016-03-24T16:06:58	neilcybart no naming scheme is perfect, but IMO has to be broad enough to allow room for interpretation rather than suggesting narrow use
jandawson	713034299524517888	2016-03-24T16:06:39	neilcybart however, I’m not sure it makes a huge difference either way – implication is getting work done. Is Netflix/YouTube productivity?
jandawson	713034169886965765	2016-03-24T16:06:08	neilcybart I bet if you asked buyers of Mac or iPad Pro models what it stood for, they’d say that too. Standard abbreviation.
jandawson	713032584305909760	2016-03-24T15:59:50	He’s at it again – retweeting nice things others say as a response to a piece seen as negative 
jandawson	713032205224648704	2016-03-24T15:58:19	neilcybart joaofabio71 BenBajarin certainly meant professional back in 1997. 
jandawson	713031664100708352	2016-03-24T15:56:10	Chris_Ciaccia My job isn’t naming products – I’ll be the first to admit this isn’t my strength. But name has to be broad, not narrow.
jandawson	713029433037180928	2016-03-24T15:47:18	neilcybart joaofabio71 BenBajarin not sure what your point is. iPad Pro shouldn’t exist? Other iPads shouldn’t exist? Pro name is wrong?
jandawson	713028920463896577	2016-03-24T15:45:16	joaofabio71 thanks!
jandawson	713028840281407488	2016-03-24T15:44:57	Chris_Ciaccia “Pro” nomenclature works because it’s not explicit and allows for other uses but denotes a premium
jandawson	713028757188059136	2016-03-24T15:44:37	Chris_Ciaccia This is actually a harder problem than that – it’s not just work or play. People do work on iPad Mini and play on iPad Pro
jandawson	713028591877881856	2016-03-24T15:43:58	joaofabio71 Indeed (from the final paragraph of the piece: ) 
jandawson	713027710474330113	2016-03-24T15:40:28	Chris_Ciaccia the reason for keeping those two specifically is there’s a very clear cost and performance differential between them.
jandawson	713027602525462529	2016-03-24T15:40:02	Chris_Ciaccia well, exactly. The naming is what hurts it. If you said we have two small iPads – premium and sub-premium, not so hard.
jandawson	713027386971820032	2016-03-24T15:39:11	kirkburgess critic reviews generally seem very negative – 33% Rotten Tomatoes score. But viewers more positive (probably self selecting)
jandawson	713027043680583680	2016-03-24T15:37:49	neilcybart BenBajarin as I said in the article, my names aren’t the point, which is that categorization is possible.
jandawson	713026484009443328	2016-03-24T15:35:35	neilcybart BenBajarin What do you think the Pro stands for? It’s shorthand – not all Mac Pros are used for formal work either
jandawson	713026261711343617	2016-03-24T15:34:42	There was lots of this kind of thing after reports about Fadell’s abrasive style. Information report further defense 
jandawson	713026094484443136	2016-03-24T15:34:02	It was clear from Fadell’s Twitter response to recent criticism of his management style that he felt burned by it 
jandawson	713025526487584769	2016-03-24T15:31:47	Chris_Ciaccia complexity comes from keeping older devices and poor naming conventions. Even then, fairly simple 
jandawson	713025326285074432	2016-03-24T15:30:59	Chris_Ciaccia did you read the piece I wrote? From a current device perspective, same 2x2 matrix as 1997 for Macs 
jandawson	713025181178957825	2016-03-24T15:30:25	Gen_Zer0 right – seems the most logical option.
jandawson	713025113063444481	2016-03-24T15:30:08	timsteno ReedAlbergotti not sure what the downside is from a PR perspective unless you feel Alphabet shouldn’t run this way
jandawson	713025047275831297	2016-03-24T15:29:53	timsteno ReedAlbergotti Not sure about that. Alphabet needs to reassure investors that it’s being fiscally responsible – that’s decent PR.
jandawson	713024692471209984	2016-03-24T15:28:28	Put another way, Apple’s problem isn’t that its portfolio is too complex. It’s mostly about naming and older devices 
jandawson	713024512384630785	2016-03-24T15:27:45	mims not quite – RAM is the same, but iPad Pro has better A-series chip (albeit slightly under clocked)
jandawson	713024248411885568	2016-03-24T15:26:42	timsteno ReedAlbergotti not sure why it should be shocking. In some ways, shocking Google/Alphabet wasn’t running this way before
jandawson	713023825802174465	2016-03-24T15:25:02	TiVo has arguably been living on borrowed time thanks to pay TV providers 
jandawson	713023509656522753	2016-03-24T15:23:46	All the snickering tweets about Apple’s portfolio getting too complex miss the point – 2016 isn’t like 1997 
jandawson	712993720191295489	2016-03-24T13:25:24	M&amp;A scoop: TiVo, the DVR pioneer, is in advanced talks to be sold to TV patent holder Rovi. LesliePicker story to follow. TIVO ROVI
jandawson	713004417134370816	2016-03-24T14:07:54	ajambrosino and many apps don't need those things on desktop (and app/service providers wouldn't want to offer them)
jandawson	713004315086966785	2016-03-24T14:07:30	ajambrosino yeah, but partly because people got used to a paradigm during the unusable period. Not so on Mac
jandawson	713003452595458048	2016-03-24T14:04:04	ajambrosino native apps were needed on mobile because web versions were unusable or unavailable. Not so on Mac
jandawson	713003237738041348	2016-03-24T14:03:13	ajambrosino given other issues with Mac App Store, UIKit isn't the only element that needs fixing.
jandawson	713003063301111808	2016-03-24T14:02:31	ajambrosino it's a balance. Browser is still by far the most universal access to apps and services online, and works fine for many of them
jandawson	713002836066340864	2016-03-24T14:01:37	ajambrosino of course. Nothing wrong with breaking paradigms, but this is an advance smart people keep anticipating and normals don't use
jandawson	713002637520556034	2016-03-24T14:00:50	ajambrosino I have. Really didn't like it. Maybe it'll evolve and get better. But didn't like implementation.
jandawson	713002469182164992	2016-03-24T14:00:10	ajambrosino but I love the People stuff, UIKit stuff (though don't think we need native apps for everything), and totally yes on macOS
jandawson	713002076951871492	2016-03-24T13:58:36	ajambrosino but just isn't what most people want or could use. Apple's new iCloud folders by app much closer to how normal people use stuff
jandawson	713001912946143232	2016-03-24T13:57:57	ajambrosino the FS stuff is unrealistic for mainstream users, who will never tag all their stuff. Vision has been anticipated for years
jandawson	712979203323367424	2016-03-24T12:27:43	Aw, this is great. And impressive.  
jandawson	713001375139962880	2016-03-24T13:55:49	Some interesting stuff here (and some really nice design). Some of it's misguided though (not least the FS stuff)

jandawson	712648877279580160	2016-03-23T14:35:07	PatrickMoorhead charlesarthur yes, though in my experience these keyboards all ask for full access.
jandawson	712648009918513152	2016-03-23T14:31:40	PatrickMoorhead charlesarthur yep. iOS KB privacy policy provides for blocking that if you want 
jandawson	712642693436801024	2016-03-23T14:10:33	WhatTheBit charlesarthur quite possibly - will tap into all that Google already knows about you.
jandawson	712642144750534658	2016-03-23T14:08:22	charlesarthur I don't think this will be about keyboard design as much as functionality. Will always be niche (all 3rd party iOS kbs are)

jandawson	712620996910428160	2016-03-23T12:44:20	bwreedbgr indeed. Was very obvious in our local caucus meeting that Cruz was the favorite though there were some Trump supporters

jandawson	711974736197058560	2016-03-21T17:56:19	Pricing for iPad Pro at 9.7” being positioned as $200 less than iPad Pro 12”, not $100 more than iPad Air at 9.7”

jandawson	711973084643725313	2016-03-21T17:49:45	The way the new iPad Pro is being positioned makes me even more skeptical iPad Air just gets abandoned. Seems like wrong thing to do

jandawson	711970126816350208	2016-03-21T17:38:00	Looks like iPhone SE does indeed replace 5S in the lineup per many predictions. But $50 less.

jandawson	711964273845481472	2016-03-21T17:14:45	That’s obviously a reflection of the volume of product announcements to be made at each event.
jandawson	711964183919665152	2016-03-21T17:14:23	Last Apple event the preamble stuff was minimal. This time, making up for that with lots of non-product updates up front.

jandawson	711961449115947008	2016-03-21T17:03:31	One of my predictions for this event was that the phrase FBI wouldn’t be mentioned, but privacy and security would be a theme anyway
jandawson	711959608504365056	2016-03-21T16:56:12	Forgot how small the town hall is at Apple. Thankfully, found a seat and now gearing up for the event.

jandawson	711934018904666113	2016-03-21T15:14:31	FWIW, Apple Music is probably at around 12m now – not sure that merits a new announcement.

jandawson	710929327903350785	2016-03-18T20:42:14	yalimgerger mg No problem. Great conversation
jandawson	710927598604259328	2016-03-18T20:35:22	yalimgerger yes, and one which now has considerable inertia behind it.
jandawson	710927090040725504	2016-03-18T20:33:21	yalimgerger would now need a strong reason to overturn the historical approach, which favors few of those who make decisions
jandawson	710927031500845057	2016-03-18T20:33:07	yalimgerger no, but in what has always been an ad-dominated medium (both Pandora and Spotify) that made the most sense.
jandawson	710926453211148288	2016-03-18T20:30:49	yalimgerger but the reality is this is just the way it’s always worked – it’s not the result of a power play, but just history.
jandawson	710926087279087616	2016-03-18T20:29:22	yalimgerger there’s an argument to be made for your version instead, but would benefit very few major stakeholders and disadvantage several
jandawson	710925982522171392	2016-03-18T20:28:57	yalimgerger In the digital era, royalties have always been paid on a per stream basis, so that’s the fundamental reason.
jandawson	710925039902679040	2016-03-18T20:25:12	yalimgerger I’m just saying that both are equitable – both aggregate and personal listens are fair but put more weight on different factors
jandawson	710923768823087104	2016-03-18T20:20:09	yalimgerger and therefore their total listening drowns out yours in aggregate figures.
jandawson	710923703882633216	2016-03-18T20:19:53	yalimgerger in other words, it’s not so much who is listened to, but who is doing the listening. Teenager listens to 1000 tracks, you 100
jandawson	710923621728788480	2016-03-18T20:19:34	yalimgerger what really makes this “unfair” is that some people listen to way more music than others and that tends to align with stars
jandawson	710923459954479104	2016-03-18T20:18:55	yalimgerger but niche artists always make less money – what makes them niche is that people listen to them less -&gt; less money.
jandawson	710922772252209152	2016-03-18T20:16:11	yalimgerger again, I see what you’re saying, but their method of distribution is equitable and simple. Yours is more personal.
jandawson	710922674793414656	2016-03-18T20:15:48	yalimgerger it’s not that your listening doesn’t count, but that if it’s utterly unrepresentative of broader patterns, it gets drowned out

jandawson	710921681959714816	2016-03-18T20:11:51	yalimgerger but I see your counterargument – that your personal listening choice is a signal to S of where you want the money to go
jandawson	710921602892836864	2016-03-18T20:11:33	yalimgerger that’s correct. But you’re still dividing the total amount of money by the total listening behavior, which is fair.
jandawson	710919130333863936	2016-03-18T20:01:43	yalimgerger however, very few artists represent themselves, hence the money goes to labels, who then divide acc. to their contracts w arts.
jandawson	710918993545003008	2016-03-18T20:01:10	yalimgerger There’s a pool of money which is what Spotify makes in revenue minus its cut, which gets divided among artists based on listens
jandawson	710918654393626625	2016-03-18T19:59:50	yalimgerger i.e. if you listen to 100 tracks in the month, 70 from JB and 5 from an indie artist, ratio of payout is 70:5
jandawson	710918498629734400	2016-03-18T19:59:12	yalimgerger You pay Spotify $10, they divide ~$7 (or whatever) to labels for artists in proportion to what you listen to.
jandawson	710916294732689408	2016-03-18T19:50:27	yalimgerger all artists get paid on the same basis. Not sure why niche artists should get paid more. Maybe I’m missing your point?

jandawson	710614739362054144	2016-03-17T23:52:11	smyth_gj from HERE's perspective, it was about whether it was worth it or not to continue making apps for Windows, which is universal.

jandawson	710590231850786816	2016-03-17T22:14:48	smyth_gj the point was about third party apps not about built in maps. We weren’t making comments about quality of maps but about app avail

jandawson	710566401887436801	2016-03-17T20:40:06	jwan584 that’s interesting. It’s always been a risk that TMO and S just attract people like you, willing to switch frequently.

jandawson	710541893281533952	2016-03-17T19:02:43	jwan584 it degrades the traffic to take 30% the bandwidth.
jandawson	710515742609768448	2016-03-17T17:18:48	Have to wonder how much this factored into it. Not a great image to go with “Don’t Be Evil”… 
jandawson	710501538876170240	2016-03-17T16:22:22	It’s kind of fitting that StartupLJackson turned out to be a pivot of sorts 
jandawson	710497126741106688	2016-03-17T16:04:50	CranWaterloo precisely. If Siri’s voice recognition improved to be on par with Echo, it’d be far more useful than Echo because omnipresent
jandawson	710488720231649280	2016-03-17T15:31:25	pavanrajam and I think the lack of a dedicated Apple app with a visual / touch UI hurts it too.
jandawson	710488647322042369	2016-03-17T15:31:08	pavanrajam yeah, I still think it’s challenging for most people to think of an Apple solution that mostly involves non-Apple products

jandawson	710479519161851904	2016-03-17T14:54:52	pavanrajam but so far I’ve struggled to find things that it does uniquely and better, and many of the services are ones I don’t use.
jandawson	710479449871884290	2016-03-17T14:54:35	pavanrajam the voice recognition is very good – better than Siri, which you’d expect from a larger device with better microphones etc.
jandawson	710477362433896448	2016-03-17T14:46:17	.neilcybart exactly. Specifics of this commercial seem very much along the lines of what Echo does.

jandawson	709520036210147328	2016-03-14T23:22:13	eriks eric_analytics and that those peers therefore generate upload traffic passively rather than actively when others consume content?
jandawson	709519930723405824	2016-03-14T23:21:48	eriks eric_analytics thanks. Not seeing anything there that contradicts my assertion. Isn’t whole point that peers supply content?
jandawson	709517720228737024	2016-03-14T23:13:01	eriks eric_analytics if not, you have a quick link to the patent?

jandawson	709517337548816384	2016-03-14T23:11:30	eriks eric_analytics maybe I need an update on P2P but WebRTC is pure party A to party B. Wouldn’t file delivery over P2P involve…
jandawson	709516682545344517	2016-03-14T23:08:53	eriks eric_analytics one thing to do it for relatively light comms, another thing to do it for massive files or streams.
jandawson	709515515652255744	2016-03-14T23:04:15	eriks eric_analytics I would think there would be significant concerns on Apple’s part about the fundamental architecture of P2P, no?
jandawson	709514739076833280	2016-03-14T23:01:10	eriks eric_analytics you guys would appear to have a horse in this race too…
jandawson	709513990729179136	2016-03-14T22:58:12	eriks eric_analytics so yes, in other words.
jandawson	709513495130152961	2016-03-14T22:56:14	eric_analytics eriks Yes, should have said no consumers.
jandawson	709513272358100992	2016-03-14T22:55:20	eriks eric_analytics understood. Is your main issue the delivery mechanism then?
jandawson	709513087150194689	2016-03-14T22:54:36	eric_analytics eriks that’s just the market structure at this point. US is essentially unique in its approach. Arguably serves none well
jandawson	709512643459960832	2016-03-14T22:52:50	eriks eric_analytics haha. I guess perhaps their opinion and yours on the legitimacy of BitTorrent might differ…
jandawson	709512513860165633	2016-03-14T22:52:20	eric_analytics eriks the licensing issue between MVPDs and content owners is really thorny, more so than STBs
jandawson	709512361049071620	2016-03-14T22:51:43	eriks eric_analytics at this point it’s open, same as the App Store, which has been genuinely open for legit apps and content or some time
jandawson	709510890148601856	2016-03-14T22:45:52	eriks eric_analytics I’d agree more competition there would be good – esp from pure OTT players – but that’s a whole other can of worms
jandawson	709510787241390080	2016-03-14T22:45:28	eriks eric_analytics but you have a choice of signal providers today – for most people, at least cable plus satellite, and for some telco
jandawson	709508286412795904	2016-03-14T22:35:32	eric_analytics eriks It’s been clear for years that CableCARD was dead. And next generation attempt needs to be very different
jandawson	709506583584083969	2016-03-14T22:28:46	eric_analytics eriks Wheeler certainly seems strongly motivated to prove you wrong. No guarantees, obviously, but he’ll try
jandawson	709506484002902016	2016-03-14T22:28:22	eric_analytics eriks a single box connected to a single input is indistinguishable from no box. Problem is box switching and bad UI on STB
jandawson	709506296144211968	2016-03-14T22:27:37	eric_analytics eriks FCC action is only meaningless if it fails to bring about meaningful change. And that depends on details of solution
jandawson	709506187591483392	2016-03-14T22:27:11	eriks eric_analytics But that’s exactly why the FCC is intervening. Consumers want it, MVPDs refuse to provide it.
jandawson	709505162260262912	2016-03-14T22:23:07	eric_analytics true. But given all the TVE apps already out there, vast majority of the content is likely available.
jandawson	709503446982877184	2016-03-14T22:16:18	eric_analytics of their motivations – iOS is potentially additive, but on the TV they want you using their STB which they can monetize
jandawson	709503375151222784	2016-03-14T22:16:01	eric_analytics the fact that MVPDs are willing to offer a fairly comprehensive pay TV app on iOS but not Roku/Apple TV is indicative
jandawson	709491013367107584	2016-03-14T21:26:53	eric_analytics Indeed. But point is MVPDs have been willing to do this on iOS but not on TV boxes, which tells you what the real reason is
jandawson	709490342798622720	2016-03-14T21:24:14	eric_analytics after all, they do this on iOS.
jandawson	709490293502910464	2016-03-14T21:24:02	eric_analytics Whether that’s true or not, pay TV providers could still offer a STB equivalent w/o those channels if they wanted to.
jandawson	709490160887418880	2016-03-14T21:23:30	eric_analytics Not simplistic. Truthful. It’s not like pay TV providers have done this w/o local broadcast channels or anything.
jandawson	709488559430852608	2016-03-14T21:17:08	eric_analytics except the pay tv providers have resolutely refused to broadly deploy full functionality apps
jandawson	709487090409472000	2016-03-14T21:11:18	eric_analytics yes, any fee will have to be minimal if it’s to be successful.
jandawson	709486712955609088	2016-03-14T21:09:48	FCC cable box reform could be just as unsuccessful as CableCARD. A lot depends on whether it’s hw or sw approach

jandawson	708424864726536192	2016-03-11T22:50:24	stevekovach as is the FBI, for that matter.

jandawson	708424191070965760	2016-03-11T22:47:43	stevekovach I’ve read most of it and it seemed more equivocal than you’re painting it to me.
jandawson	708423654460116993	2016-03-11T22:45:35	stevekovach Seemed like he was very careful not to take sides, avoiding discussing the specific case but outlining merits of both sides.

jandawson	705415772147810306	2016-03-03T15:33:20	bmkatz gigastacey yes, though loses some functionality in the process.
jandawson	705408317598801920	2016-03-03T15:03:43	charlesarthur but, to return to my original tweet, point of Romney speech is to avert that outcome. Which I said was likely futile.
jandawson	705407236617572352	2016-03-03T14:59:25	charlesarthur how else to stop the man? If people keep voting for him, he's a shoo-in for Republican candidate.
jandawson	705402325800603649	2016-03-03T14:39:54	gigastacey Makes sense as second speaker option, too, certainly.
jandawson	705399348373245952	2016-03-03T14:28:04	gigastacey suspect it’s a way to limit demand while they ramp up supply. But odd way to go about it.
jandawson	705399164377526280	2016-03-03T14:27:21	charlesarthur If you’re willing to vote Trump, I think it’s very likely you’re living in that bubble and therefore unpersuadable.
jandawson	705398971976458240	2016-03-03T14:26:35	Echo Dot, arguably for people who don’t want to buy an Echo, can only be ordered through an Echo (or Fire TV)… 
jandawson	705398200836841472	2016-03-03T14:23:31	charlesarthur in that world, facts are in the eye of the beholder, other viewpoints are entirely discounted.
jandawson	705398129760215040	2016-03-03T14:23:14	charlesarthur One of Trump’s biggest weapons is tapping into the separate worldview fomented by radio/TV hosts over the last few years
jandawson	705398016291639296	2016-03-03T14:22:47	charlesarthur that’s because Romney’s supporters were fundamentally rational and living in the real world.
jandawson	705397932401434630	2016-03-03T14:22:27	charlesarthur doesn’t matter – Trump is the exception to the old saying “You’re entitled to your own opinions, but not your own facts”

jandawson	705391350955380737	2016-03-03T13:56:18	Would love to believe Romney’s speech (or anything else anyone else might say) would make a difference on Trump, but seems very unlikely.

jandawson	701886903784583168	2016-02-22T21:50:52	In other words, Fitbit is having to spend more heavily all the time to get people to buy more of its devices. Unsustainable over time.

jandawson	701883203766779905	2016-02-22T21:36:10	BenBajarin but this is for one year only, and of course many of those devices were sold in the days before the end of the year
jandawson	701883105301233664	2016-02-22T21:35:47	Amazing how every year Fitbit’s Q4 is way above Q1-Q3, but more or less sets new baseline for following year.

jandawson	698256325420064768	2016-02-12T21:24:15	fromedome to the point of my second reply, it would therefore be a decent proxy for iOS users (vs. devices in use at ~1bn)
jandawson	698255512081567744	2016-02-12T21:21:01	fromedome if it was active users only, would be a decent proxy for unique Apple users.
jandawson	698255418024288256	2016-02-12T21:20:39	fromedome would definitely be more useful if it was *active* users – hard to know what account it takes of dormant accounts

jandawson	697552295848857600	2016-02-10T22:46:41	WaltFrench yeah, no doubt they’re catching up (or at least keeping pace given their relative ages).
jandawson	697550369602207744	2016-02-10T22:39:02	WaltFrench yeah, not sure I buy that Twitter is Apple. But curious to hear your argument if you think they are
jandawson	697549479818326016	2016-02-10T22:35:30	Just put my Twitter Q4 deck up on Slideshare as an example of what I do for subscribers:   
jandawson	697548604727144448	2016-02-10T22:32:01	There’s an argument to be made that at both FB and Twitter, “ARPU” is becoming less accurate (Twitter because of logged out, FB: Instagram)
jandawson	697548169995878400	2016-02-10T22:30:18	WaltFrench was 7x back in Q2 2011, now 1.8x. Gap definitely shrinking. But FB has &gt;5x the users in addition to 1.8x the ARPU
jandawson	697547180828028928	2016-02-10T22:26:22	ShiraOvide have to assume diminishing returns (plus negative MAU growth)

jandawson	697544412423806976	2016-02-10T22:15:22	Twitter says DAU as % of MAU were flat quarter on quarter, same in January. This is apparently a good thing (DAU/MAU is rising at FB)
jandawson	697542619895697408	2016-02-10T22:08:14	I predict “resurrected users” (mentioned just now on the Twitter earnings call) is going to be the subject of much coverage… zombietwitter
jandawson	697541385893720065	2016-02-10T22:03:20	lsukernik ah – you figured it out. Bummer.
jandawson	697541340016431104	2016-02-10T22:03:09	joshdickson40 Thanks!
jandawson	697539934039597056	2016-02-10T21:57:34	joshdickson40 Indeed, though they claim by end of January they were back at Q3 levels…
jandawson	697539782507823104	2016-02-10T21:56:58	The good news, though, is that ARPU is rising fast (as at FB, though much lower), driving revenue growth and margins 
jandawson	697538964043878400	2016-02-10T21:53:43	No consistency or predictability at all in Twitter’s key ad metrics… 
jandawson	697533797756071936	2016-02-10T21:33:11	We’re focused now on what TWTR does best: live. Live commentary, live connections, live conversations.
jandawson	697533580117839872	2016-02-10T21:32:19	As of the end of January, we’ve seen MAUs return to Q3 levels. Confident in continued growth with disciplined execution. TWTR
jandawson	697537367586971648	2016-02-10T21:47:22	MAU growth at Twitter continues to be horrible, especially if you focus on core MAUs not SMS followers 
jandawson	697535145398575104	2016-02-10T21:38:32	It was nice of Twitter to hold their earnings release up for a bit so I could get to the airport…

jandawson	696820698698809344	2016-02-08T22:19:35	AAPLTree these aren’t bugs in most cases – features that seem obvious from start but are missing, mostly. E.g. Remote app on ATV
jandawson	696820320028610560	2016-02-08T22:18:05	AAPLTree both should have either been better in v1 or held back until ready. First impressions last…
jandawson	696820236373217280	2016-02-08T22:17:45	AAPLTree Both the Apple Watch and Apple TV have several features which were poor or missing in v1, have been fixed since.

jandawson	696736903723225090	2016-02-08T16:46:37	abdophoto i.e. network issues are transparently carrier’s fault. Streaming issues much more opaque to the user re assigning blame.
jandawson	696736784353341440	2016-02-08T16:46:08	abdophoto no, but what I’m saying is people knew Cingular/AT&amp;T was to blame back then and rightly blamed them, not Apple.
jandawson	696735423704408064	2016-02-08T16:40:44	abdophoto i.e. do people know it was CBS’s fault the Super Bowl didn’t stream properly? Or do they just blame the ATV?
jandawson	696735338559983617	2016-02-08T16:40:24	abdophoto interestingly, in early iPhone days people associated bad things with Cingular, good things with Apple. Not sure holds for ATV

jandawson	695747457649512448	2016-02-05T23:14:54	elliotcsmith rUv yeah, it’s mostly the American sports (and the influence of advertising) that suffers from this problem.
jandawson	695747368621223936	2016-02-05T23:14:33	FeitaInc BB10 is dead. It’s just a question of time. No mobile OS other than Android &amp; iOS has a chance in the next few years

jandawson	695744428682547200	2016-02-05T23:02:52	FeitaInc no problem – always interesting to discuss this stuff with someone with a different perspective. :)

jandawson	695740959682744320	2016-02-05T22:49:05	FeitaInc They have QNX for non-smartphone devices. Hard to see where BB10 would be better.

jandawson	695740455296770048	2016-02-05T22:47:05	FeitaInc they have customers that have just bought BB10 devices that they have to support. Hence reluctance to announce its death
jandawson	695739977833943040	2016-02-05T22:45:11	FeitaInc very little current value versus quite a bit of current cost for keeping it around (even in maintenance mode). Doesn’t seem smart
jandawson	695739111773065216	2016-02-05T22:41:45	inafried presumably the “Verizon representative” is a PR person?
jandawson	695738105509187585	2016-02-05T22:37:45	Looks like Verizon’s argument here is that it’s paying itself internally to do sponsored data. Won’t go down well

jandawson	695731680821161984	2016-02-05T22:12:13	Verizon’s Go90 move is a great trial balloon from a net neutrality perspective for whatever AT&amp;T is working on for mobile video
jandawson	695730922268655616	2016-02-05T22:09:12	RogerWCheng seems a more straightforward breach than BingeOn, which at least is open to all. Would be v interested to hear their defense
jandawson	695730824679788545	2016-02-05T22:08:49	RogerWCheng it seems like a fairly clear breach of net neutrality as most people define it – treating your own content preferentially.

jandawson	695668773764771840	2016-02-05T18:02:15	nitinalabur worth noting there have been other interesting inconsistencies between Mixpanel and Apple numbers:

jandawson	692478290544758784	2016-01-27T22:44:24	If I heard right, Sheryl Sandberg just referred to a “click to missed call” ad in emerging markets. Great adaptation of click to call model

jandawson	692470560467619840	2016-01-27T22:13:41	saila yep, sounds about right
jandawson	692470072468750336	2016-01-27T22:11:45	gavincostello Definitely part of it. But FB also driving higher ARPU in US especially
jandawson	692469787646169089	2016-01-27T22:10:37	BenedictEvans that doesn’t seem right. Mobile MAUs are 1.4bn vs total MAUs at 1.59bn. By implication, computer-only just 149m
jandawson	692469049150849024	2016-01-27T22:07:41	saila Google over the same period: (note $6bn is roughly where FB is now, and Google was back in Q1 2010) 
jandawson	692467196992315394	2016-01-27T22:00:19	gavincostello what’s amazing is that it’s still accelerating, despite relative maturity of the product and high penetration in high markets
jandawson	692464652534616064	2016-01-27T21:50:13	eric_analytics BenBajarin Apple’s annual service ARPU is around $20.
jandawson	692462047330734081	2016-01-27T21:39:52	brianshall BenBajarin I think that’s why they’re doing peer to peer payments free, as an incentive.
jandawson	692461542600785921	2016-01-27T21:37:51	brianshall BenBajarin biggest challenge for FB in payments IMO is getting users to add credit card first time. After that, a lot easier
jandawson	692461423255908352	2016-01-27T21:37:23	Rahul_Mangalore yes, two levers both working together – significant user growth plus rapid ARPU growth.
jandawson	692460841803870208	2016-01-27T21:35:04	BenBajarin brianshall I’m not disagreeing with your theory, just saying that regardless of the theory there’s no product yet for revenue

jandawson	692457940914167808	2016-01-27T21:23:33	BenBajarin My point is that payments as currently constituted at FB is old stuff. New payment stuff isn’t designed to generate rev yet

jandawson	690640798979723264	2016-01-22T21:02:52	kirkburgess BenBajarin higher makes no sense to me. iPhone 6 is already available at $549. Why price this at $549 too?

jandawson	690217644822102017	2016-01-21T17:01:24	sbono14 The numbers help Apple in that they appear to be pushing people to buy more expensive devices. Not that they drive more upgrades
jandawson	690215248855306241	2016-01-21T16:51:53	sbono14 far more of their base is on installment plans, where there’s an incentive not to upgrade. Plus higher fees, no direct push

jandawson	687696035846619136	2016-01-14T18:01:26	sameer_singh17 yeah, I still think you’re conflating two things that don’t have to go together. But I suspect we’d better leave it there.

jandawson	687695375935746048	2016-01-14T17:58:49	sameer_singh17 I don’t think the two have to be as mutually exclusive as you’re making out. Drivers learn that cars are good at this, then…
jandawson	687692930119643137	2016-01-14T17:49:05	sameer_singh17 but even if Google did want to just use it for its own Uber service, that’s still a huge leap for a potential passenger

jandawson	687408735241801730	2016-01-13T22:59:48	naynerz haha. Sorry! :)
jandawson	687408106549174272	2016-01-13T22:57:18	chx triketora but I’d question your premise too. Ads isn’t a “trick”, but a business model (as selling hardware is for Apple).

jandawson	687407305076436992	2016-01-13T22:54:07	chx triketora that’s less and less true all the time (and deliberately so).
jandawson	687407154333114372	2016-01-13T22:53:31	naynerz I think it can be done very well in some markets. But in tech, where almost everything eventually gets absorbed into ecosystems…
jandawson	687407010468466688	2016-01-13T22:52:57	BenBajarin neilcybart and at $200, it’s undercutting the top of the line models by half or more, which I suspect is part of the prob too
jandawson	687406924845965312	2016-01-13T22:52:36	BenBajarin neilcybart That’s just it though – if that’s the one you like best, it’s not exactly the low-end intro to GoPro it’s becoming
jandawson	687406209524207616	2016-01-13T22:49:46	WaltFrench BenBajarin neilcybart just wasn’t the right product to do it with. Poorly positioned (and priced)
jandawson	687405807961542659	2016-01-13T22:48:10	BenBajarin neilcybart i.e. positioned Session as smallest, most portable, when it should have been just lower-powered, same size.
jandawson	687405498535133184	2016-01-13T22:46:56	BenBajarin neilcybart Session probably wasn’t the right product to pursue this strategy with.
jandawson	687404813869576192	2016-01-13T22:44:13	BenBajarin neilcybart 2 issues: 1. wouldn’t have been profitable, 2. would have undercut other devices (both of which happened anyway)
jandawson	687403748927401986	2016-01-13T22:39:59	Just over a month ago, I wrote about how dangerous it was to be a one-trick pony in tech. Cited Fitbit, GoPro…

jandawson	687402539332038658	2016-01-13T22:35:11	Big reason for GoPro’s poor performance was the terribly positioned Hero4 Session, which then got big price cuts, undercutting other devices

jandawson	687378677563174912	2016-01-13T21:00:22	eric_analytics ampressman yeah, but if Apple is getting out of the business of selling the ads, maybe it doesn’t matter
jandawson	687376388047818752	2016-01-13T20:51:16	ampressman poor wording, apparently misconstrued by many. It is stepping back in that it’s removing itself as middleman, but not abandoning

jandawson	687374882678554624	2016-01-13T20:45:17	If you read the Buzzfeed piece carefully, iAd also isn’t going away. Apple just removing itself from ad sales, other middleman roles.
jandawson	687374357081931776	2016-01-13T20:43:12	Intriguing. Ostensibly nothing to do with privacy, where iAd continues to be an uncomfortable wrinkle in its stance

jandawson	687359263379853312	2016-01-13T19:43:13	maxrogo yeah, I’ve usually been able to get the Nest to reboot once I’m physically present. But nothing doing if you’re remote or unaware…
jandawson	687358834038407168	2016-01-13T19:41:31	ampressman Interesting. Perot is symptomatic of another wrinkle in this approach: 3rd party candidate who splits incumbent’s vote
jandawson	687358499433525248	2016-01-13T19:40:11	I’ve had the same Nest issues as those being reported today. Worst thing about it is there’s no fallback. When it’s dead, no control at all
jandawson	687357658689441792	2016-01-13T19:36:50	ampressman huh. Still, average of 60%, at about 50% in late 1992…

jandawson	685208515414081536	2016-01-07T21:16:55	maxrogo neilcybart tim that’s another argument in its favor. Acquisition doesn’t have to be today and it might be smart to wait months
jandawson	685208232718024704	2016-01-07T21:15:47	maxrogo neilcybart tim I’m curious to see what happens to the share price once margins tank following this big bang expansion
jandawson	685207935224426496	2016-01-07T21:14:36	neilcybart tim but I’m also not saying Neflix = Beats. Significant differences, not least a big customer base
jandawson	685207842983264256	2016-01-07T21:14:14	neilcybart tim I disagree with that characterization of the Beats acquisition. Definitely some tangibles in there too
jandawson	685206522750611457	2016-01-07T21:09:00	tim That's still a bit of an oversimplification but yes.
jandawson	685203045341216768	2016-01-07T20:55:11	tim Netflix acquisition would be all about the relationships. Beats was too, to some extent.
jandawson	685202379117965312	2016-01-07T20:52:32	tim Getting into music wasn’t about acquiring a customer base, and this wouldn’t be either. Spotify’s product arguably no better than Beats
jandawson	685202190974124032	2016-01-07T20:51:47	ampressman character of this acquisition would be very different. Only cited the cross platform nature of Apple Music as the argument here

jandawson	685196349042593792	2016-01-07T20:28:34	stevekovach I’ve been skeptical all along, but it’s always interesting to hear that view validated
jandawson	685196176585396224	2016-01-07T20:27:53	stevekovach which is interesting, because T-Mobile would have you believe their coverage is now almost as good as big guys
jandawson	685195768769069056	2016-01-07T20:26:16	stevekovach so it’s a coverage issue.
jandawson	685195594080501761	2016-01-07T20:25:34	stevekovach why?
jandawson	685195283890737152	2016-01-07T20:24:20	Which is why it’s also tough for those who missed the boat on smartphone components to do well in newer categories

jandawson	685133780621762561	2016-01-07T16:19:57	KevinCTofel The other thing I left out of the original tweet was a comment about base size. Windows is huge, but Windows Store still small
jandawson	685133674396782592	2016-01-07T16:19:31	KevinCTofel yeah, but this is for watching shows. Do you need notifications for that? Also, tradeoff against base size / usage

jandawson	684418086384975876	2016-01-05T16:56:02	As I have for the last few years, kicking off my CES with AT&amp;T’s Developer Event keynote this morning. Sounds like it should be newsworthy…
jandawson	684402078618238977	2016-01-05T15:52:25	analyseasia Thanks!
jandawson	684102362554830848	2016-01-04T20:01:27	We recommend jandawson's &amp; aaronmiller "Beyond Devices" podcast:

jandawson	682670745399369728	2015-12-31T21:12:43	I’ll be at CES next week for a couple of days. I’ve deliberately left my schedule fairly light, but let me know if you’d like to meet.
jandawson	682582088193826816	2015-12-31T15:20:26	One of my last posts of the year and its a good one: Apple patents payments in iMessage, phone calls, emails, &amp; more 
jandawson	681706332303433728	2015-12-29T05:20:29	basche42 it’s part of it. WhatsApp is too. But unlikely to make a big dent in China and other important Asian markets
jandawson	681705856048627712	2015-12-29T05:18:36	basche42 yep
jandawson	681705342032424960	2015-12-29T05:16:33	basche42 yeah, tough thing about any Asian app is they’re strong in one or a handful of countries at best. So it’s a partial buy-in only
jandawson	681704667806474240	2015-12-29T05:13:52	basche42 Yeah, those are the obvious options.
jandawson	681485721958416384	2015-12-28T14:43:52	Hey zacharye we're working on big things for Mac Outlook. Thanks for the suggestions for iOS. I hate email again 
jandawson	681171580408299521	2015-12-27T17:55:34	We just sang this hymn (based on a Longfellow poem) in church. Love this sentiment in this crazy world we live in. 
jandawson	681140060008284160	2015-12-27T15:50:19	Nice weather for an early morning church meeting (and this was afterwards, when the sun had come up) 
jandawson	680504310854074368	2015-12-25T21:44:05	KeithRParsons awesome!
jandawson	680495065811161088	2015-12-25T21:07:21	MarkDMill You too!
jandawson	680494122004697088	2015-12-25T21:03:36	I've always loved this painting of the nativity (of which my in-laws have a copy). Merry Christmas to all of you! 
jandawson	680136094663323648	2015-12-24T21:20:55	JackSmithIV eg many college students are likely broadband cord nevers because broadband is provided in dorms etc. Does that factor in?
jandawson	680135890765660160	2015-12-24T21:20:07	JackSmithIV not my article - just my stats on TV cord cutting. I feel there’s something missing here too - esp % of college students etc
jandawson	679496230498504706	2015-12-23T02:58:20	You can stream the Beatles on Apple Music, Spotify + everywhere else Dec. 24  by pkafka 
jandawson	678972129841315840	2015-12-21T16:15:45	A surprising share of cord-cutters don't even subscribe to home broadband:
