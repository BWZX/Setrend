TheEnergyTrader	702868932366098433	2016-02-25T14:53:06	Trader_Dante still better risk management than LEH
TheEnergyTrader	702860479966924800	2016-02-25T14:19:31	I think mkt changed on the president day holiday from 'bearish til proven wrong' to 'bullish til proven wrong'  ES_F
TheEnergyTrader	702860142107299841	2016-02-25T14:18:11	CL_F levels to watch 30.50/30.80  key  wk sup   31.20 int 31.50 day sup 32.40/50 wk res. 33/33.1 key sup  33.90/34.20 key month sup.
TheEnergyTrader	702853711916359680	2016-02-25T13:52:37	in those cases how is the texture of the selling is key to see what its going on and if buyers are somewhere ES_F
TheEnergyTrader	702853588054319104	2016-02-25T13:52:08	by second day selloff I mean. market peaked, then had his first day of selling, and then a second day were the moves accelerates ES_F
TheEnergyTrader	702853354377052160	2016-02-25T13:51:12	also to consider: first time on 16 on ES_F that we saw that kind of rejection after a second-day selloff,this may want to push thorugh res.
TheEnergyTrader	702852989439053824	2016-02-25T13:49:45	risk on trade of yday notes: GC_F off previous high by 5, USDJPY just hit previous high and ZB_F not even close Feb-11 highs
TheEnergyTrader	702550280089509888	2016-02-24T17:46:54	CL_F trading at numbers seen 24h ago

TheEnergyTrader	700439294889091076	2016-02-18T21:58:36	CL_F made 80% off highs, which is interesting is that we never had a limit down on the way down
TheEnergyTrader	700358601576181760	2016-02-18T16:37:57	there is volume fading as well on the old contract, seems CLJ6 better for longs entries while CLH6 for short entries CL_F
TheEnergyTrader	700358279818539009	2016-02-18T16:36:40	oil drop seems more in line with the EIA vs API miss than the AP headline, as saudis never said before they were cutting production CL_F

TheEnergyTrader	700346389306478592	2016-02-18T15:49:25	so clearly ES_F needs to hold 16/17/18 area to keep this going up otherwise we are going south
TheEnergyTrader	700346251670384640	2016-02-18T15:48:52	I read today action as: someone woke up today with the idea of selling the rally, then found where the bid is standing ES_F

TheEnergyTrader	698186773629902848	2016-02-12T16:47:53	Trader_Dante you know what they said 'timing its key' (even to go to the toilette)
TheEnergyTrader	698148368120422400	2016-02-12T14:15:16	SlopeOfHope yes F is to imply is futures, current H and about to move to M
TheEnergyTrader	698146363205361665	2016-02-12T14:07:18	SlopeOfHope seems the same on ZB_F
TheEnergyTrader	698144757260935168	2016-02-12T14:00:55	after years of nothing going on you can trade GC_F IV right now (or GVX)
TheEnergyTrader	698142867714404353	2016-02-12T13:53:25	CoderTrader may be for this contract, consider that expiration is next week and the new one trades 1.5 higher
TheEnergyTrader	697889432767176704	2016-02-11T21:06:21	izakaminska u said the 'N' word
TheEnergyTrader	697880080207499264	2016-02-11T20:29:11	chigrl hit the head against the books?
TheEnergyTrader	697857582904516608	2016-02-11T18:59:47	vader7x ES_F its holding because of his tech components, either banks bounce and NQ_F takes off or most likely dump into the close

TheEnergyTrader	697758940365512704	2016-02-11T12:27:49	zerohedge its actually USDMXN the only thing that matters
TheEnergyTrader	697458592090349568	2016-02-10T16:34:21	latest 3 hours 60m time frame on ES_F  bullish candlestick - bearish candlestick then neutral candlestick, pretty much shows the mood
TheEnergyTrader	696890968348495872	2016-02-09T02:58:49	Rayner_Teo pretty simiar pattern to ES_F, probably both doomed, USDJPY to 110-2 first target
TheEnergyTrader	696785152899424256	2016-02-08T19:58:20	GoldnerTrade hey how u been?, you up to AAPL opts  now

TheEnergyTrader	696766890111279104	2016-02-08T18:45:46	so, at this pace market could be in this mood until Yellen on Wed
TheEnergyTrader	696762891622576130	2016-02-08T18:29:53	of course TA speaking, a good pair trading strategist could taking advantage of this tumoil by trading relative strenght
TheEnergyTrader	696762675385274368	2016-02-08T18:29:01	its one of those days that the close's homework will be find out wich stks are compromised after today, which ones are still intact
TheEnergyTrader	696758891338711040	2016-02-08T18:13:59	seems like a given that ES_F will have the lowest close in years, but also the fact that NQ_F below 3990 cls opens the g for more selling
TheEnergyTrader	696758505106231296	2016-02-08T18:12:27	MktOutperform PCHtrades its actually in the making so this correction could be bigger than one those previous
TheEnergyTrader	695623646061162496	2016-02-05T15:02:55	this is some sort of flight to safety on eq. kind of environment, see how XLF XLB perform decently while anything NQ_F related poorly

TheEnergyTrader	692427935014350848	2016-01-27T19:24:19	I wondef if there is an scenario (for next month) where CL_F is pushing higher with aq indexes strulling and pushing lower ES_F

TheEnergyTrader	690232410785648640	2016-01-21T18:00:05	of course we may have follow thorugh if the bottom (at least for this leg) is in, but may be not that fast n easy as it felt an hr ago ES_F
TheEnergyTrader	690232021856174080	2016-01-21T17:58:32	so, so far, after the market made a decent move (like 50/70p moves) no follow through, rather hit n run ES_F
TheEnergyTrader	690231861545693186	2016-01-21T17:57:54	another thought would be: potential bottom for a couple of days is crashing w lack of willigness to go long for a followthough rally ES_F
TheEnergyTrader	690231578048516096	2016-01-21T17:56:46	recent days on ES_F around 1.30pm 2.30pm  et started a counter-trend move w risk of change in trend, today we have $8 off highs already
