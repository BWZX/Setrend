richeisen	691364850337886208	2016-01-24T20:59:59	Manning has already doubled his total season TD output at home in 16 minutes of football.
richeisen	691364189009350657	2016-01-24T20:57:22	Wow. A Brady mistake deep in his own end after a Gostowski missed PAT. Two rare miscues.
richeisen	691363527366283264	2016-01-24T20:54:44	Apologies to Kubiak, not that he's on Twitter. Perhaps he told his players about picking up loose balls and Hillman pulled a rock.
richeisen	691360920207908864	2016-01-24T20:44:22	This is on Kubiak. Against any Pats team, I would drill my guys to pick up every loose ball. Belichick best situational coach ever.
richeisen	691360288818376704	2016-01-24T20:41:52	How a team does not pick up loose ball vs patriots is beyond me. Belichick always coaches his guys to do right thing. This may be reversed.
richeisen	691357508498124800	2016-01-24T20:30:49	According to my TL, that was a great no-call and good D or refs biased against the Pats on behalf of Pats-hating NFL. No grey area today.
richeisen	691356940711006208	2016-01-24T20:28:34	The guy who didn't throw the flag on that play is Carl Johnson, the former head of refs.
richeisen	691355067568431104	2016-01-24T20:21:07	No doubt.  
richeisen	691354990523232256	2016-01-24T20:20:49	Well then. That was surprisingly easy.

richeisen	688849303075336192	2016-01-17T22:24:06	Spurrier was a back up in 1971 title game. And the year before too. So Carson v. Cam will be first matchup of Heisman QBs in a title game.
richeisen	688843598805078016	2016-01-17T22:01:26	Next week's AZ-CAR game will be first matchup of Heisman QBs in a championship game since 1971 when Roger Staubach beat...Steve Spurrier
richeisen	688837046438244352	2016-01-17T21:35:24	No surprise Seahawks proved to be a tough out in the end. AZCardinals v Panthers is fitting NFC Title Game. Best 2 NFC teams all year.
richeisen	688818296808845312	2016-01-17T20:20:54	A quality Nostradamus moment by buck on the fake punt.

richeisen	688800771672899584	2016-01-17T19:11:15	Quality Pitino reference.  
richeisen	688800301042667520	2016-01-17T19:09:23	To lend fresh perspective to greatest playoff comeback ever, Frank Reich came back from 32 down, one more than current Seattle deficit
richeisen	688793619122094080	2016-01-17T18:42:50	Needed to start 15 minutes ago.  
richeisen	688792096593948672	2016-01-17T18:36:47	And an absolute, staggering mouth punch of a first-quarter  by the top seed.
richeisen	688785985396592640	2016-01-17T18:12:30	Look of a man whose Bold Prediction was panthers held to less than 100 yards rushing after 75 such yards 1st drive.

richeisen	688587740242284544	2016-01-17T05:04:45	Just saw the Hail Mary again. It's more impressive than the one in Detroit. 55 yards in air. Against grain of his body. Falling away. Wow.

richeisen	688583564393238528	2016-01-17T04:48:09	To recap the finish: 1) Hail Mary 2) Coin Flop 3) Fitzsanity
richeisen	688582089046818816	2016-01-17T04:42:17	Meanwhile, the ways the packers seasons have ended in the house of the NFC West champs last two years is beyond heart-wrenching.
richeisen	688581195718762497	2016-01-17T04:38:44	And that's how Carson Palmer gets his first career playoff win.
richeisen	688581107097288704	2016-01-17T04:38:23	What a play call to end it.
richeisen	688580705329086464	2016-01-17T04:36:48	That may be the most mind-blowing, exhilarating back-to-back snaps I've ever seen.
richeisen	688580460797009921	2016-01-17T04:35:49	Holy shyte.
richeisen	688580263165612033	2016-01-17T04:35:02	Of course SNFonNBC has slomo of the coin flip.
richeisen	688579461936066562	2016-01-17T04:31:51	Did someone call backsies?
richeisen	688578732320145408	2016-01-17T04:28:57	This stands as called.
richeisen	688578374093017088	2016-01-17T04:27:32	Rodgers is officially the most dangerous QB outside of 40 yards ever.
richeisen	688578014523691009	2016-01-17T04:26:06	You have got to me kidding me.
richeisen	688577463845163008	2016-01-17T04:23:55	Hail Mary time.
richeisen	688576775048151045	2016-01-17T04:21:10	Spectacular.
richeisen	688576425155137536	2016-01-17T04:19:47	Refs need to call things regardless of timing.
richeisen	688574824872984577	2016-01-17T04:13:26	What a break for Green Bay. All for being aggressive but don't like that play call one bit.
richeisen	688572103000338436	2016-01-17T04:02:37	bruce_arthur you host for me tomorrow. I write your next column. On 3. Break.

richeisen	688571455395647489	2016-01-17T04:00:02	Live shot of current Carson Palmer-led offense. 
richeisen	688569008929419265	2016-01-17T03:50:19	Snuck that in a tight window. Wow.
richeisen	688567867264995328	2016-01-17T03:45:47	The ball was down by contact with the ground.
richeisen	688567774298296320	2016-01-17T03:45:25	Forget being down. He didn't even catch it.
richeisen	688566877623156736	2016-01-17T03:41:51	Gotta love how CollinsworthNBC calls it like he sees it. Not everyone in a seat like his does that. TroyAikman does too.
richeisen	688564455123234816	2016-01-17T03:32:13	Check that. This SHOULD absolutely be a catch.
richeisen	688564401708765185	2016-01-17T03:32:00	This is absolutely a catch.
richeisen	688532271574290434	2016-01-17T01:24:20	Philly take.  
richeisen	688523670755528704	2016-01-17T00:50:09	Based on last minute of this game, new nflnetwork lineup:  "That's So Andy Reid" followed by "That's So Patriots"
richeisen	688523014162415616	2016-01-17T00:47:33	The Chiefs should huddle up now in case they get the ball back.
richeisen	688522675728220160	2016-01-17T00:46:12	Well done.  
richeisen	688522662620966912	2016-01-17T00:46:09	Without a doubt.  
richeisen	688521637554032640	2016-01-17T00:42:05	How do they not have multiple plays called!!!!!
richeisen	688521320254996481	2016-01-17T00:40:49	Like it.  
richeisen	688520925323509760	2016-01-17T00:39:15	There are no more synonyms for the word "dreadful" to describe the Chiefs clock-handling and urgent play-calling right now.
richeisen	688519865292820480	2016-01-17T00:35:02	KC needs more hurry up in the hurry up.
richeisen	688517426661568512	2016-01-17T00:25:21	Not at all. Have not a single care about who wins or loses. Just want good clean play.  
richeisen	688516661607964672	2016-01-17T00:22:18	Don't know why they're celebrating a pick. Cost them 20 yards. This is over anyway.
richeisen	688516394309160960	2016-01-17T00:21:15	Please put me on the Catch Committee.
richeisen	688515970541858816	2016-01-17T00:19:34	Under the way I'd like catch rule to be written and interpreted, this would be a catch/fumble.
richeisen	688506098005901312	2016-01-16T23:40:20	Ware must be in a doghouse for Davis to get the ball after a fumble.
richeisen	688502786820935680	2016-01-16T23:27:10	Dreadful result for Chiefs@om drive that needed to net points.
richeisen	688496122579390464	2016-01-16T23:00:41	End of half stuff that has Eagles fans cackling right now. Cackling.
richeisen	688491984130998272	2016-01-16T22:44:15	MVP-type stuff from Brady. KC must take advantage now of scoring on both sides of halftime otherwise it's extremely tough sledding.
richeisen	688484276719849472	2016-01-16T22:13:37	The marshallfaulk Bold Prediction for this game was Brady would set playoff personal best with 55 attempts.   First quarter: 16.  OnPace
richeisen	688476810963595264	2016-01-16T21:43:57	Definitely not the on-to-Cincinnati Patriots who showed up on that first series.

richeisen	686348301679984645	2016-01-11T00:46:01	Much will be made of all 4 road teams winning. But all 4 home teams started first-time playoff QBs who now fall to 42-53 since 1990.

richeisen	686056143727112192	2016-01-10T05:25:05	p_shelton73 my point is Porter's presence could easily be viewed as provocative and flag-worthy.
richeisen	686055967885148160	2016-01-10T05:24:23	Not that I know of. Trainers. Head coach. That's it. And I love Joey. He's not even Brown's position coach.  
richeisen	686055297345953793	2016-01-10T05:21:43	Sure looks to me like Adam Jones was responding to an assistant coach on the field and got flagged for it.
richeisen	686050906446544896	2016-01-10T05:04:16	Still need to see what Adam Jones did for 15 yards and why Joey Porter was out on the field.

richeisen	686030709975171072	2016-01-10T03:44:01	There's going to be a revolt in Cincy when this gets called a fumble.

richeisen	686021052950958080	2016-01-10T03:05:39	Absurd that a celebration penalty that should never have existed sticks.
richeisen	686020202325135360	2016-01-10T03:02:16	That sequence has an all-she-wrote feel to it. Even if it isn't a touchdown.
richeisen	686020031403016192	2016-01-10T03:01:35	That sequence has an all-she-wrote feel to it.
richeisen	686015253180579841	2016-01-10T02:42:36	Six quarters into the postseason and the home team has yet to score a point.
