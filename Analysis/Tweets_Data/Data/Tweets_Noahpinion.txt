Noahpinion	725898325187301377	2016-04-29T04:03:41	wagonomics jm0rt I think he was talking about policy advocacy, not research.
Noahpinion	725898217066500096	2016-04-29T04:03:16	jm0rt wagonomics And that kind of thing is REALLY hard to detect except in huge samples. Naidu, et al. did a great job quantifying it.
Noahpinion	725897928909402112	2016-04-29T04:02:07	jm0rt wagonomics And I've personally seen lots of papers that seemed politically motivated, not a huge % but they are out there I think.
Noahpinion	725897486267736064	2016-04-29T04:00:21	jm0rt wagonomics I think the paper I showed shows that ideology has a pretty small (in terms of R-squared) but real effect on conclusions.
Noahpinion	725897237109309440	2016-04-29T03:59:22	jm0rt wagonomics But also, economists are only human, and ideology is bound to influence research a *little* bit, no matter what.
Noahpinion	725895283427647488	2016-04-29T03:51:36	mcyost brendonbrewer Yep.
Noahpinion	725894224697278464	2016-04-29T03:47:24	jm0rt wagonomics I mean, sometimes taking a stand is good, but we don't want the discipline to become anthropology, right?
Noahpinion	725894103729356800	2016-04-29T03:46:55	jm0rt wagonomics Well, I think economists' allergy to politicization is one of the best things about the culture.

Noahpinion	725892756237901824	2016-04-29T03:41:34	jm0rt wagonomics Yep, I asked they authors about that, they said they'd work on it...
Noahpinion	725892474112200704	2016-04-29T03:40:26	wagonomics jm0rt But in any case, there is some evidence on this question:

Noahpinion	725887591275499520	2016-04-29T03:21:02	jm0rt wagonomics Yep, that's what I've seen to. But more focus on empirical proof = less pressure to obey the church of "markets work".
Noahpinion	725886325858127872	2016-04-29T03:16:01	jm0rt wagonomics What's your experience?
Noahpinion	725886064196521985	2016-04-29T03:14:58	DLin71 I mean...think big here. WHY NOT BOTH? We can set up a system of checkpoints throughout the country!
Noahpinion	725885025531523073	2016-04-29T03:10:51	wagonomics I think that's right. But I think they're more willing to entertain answers that don't presuppose that markets work great.
Noahpinion	725884852222971904	2016-04-29T03:10:09	scottmurphy09 Probably so, but they're more in the minority now I think, and people take them less seriously.
Noahpinion	725884605346267137	2016-04-29T03:09:10	wagonomics Well, one would hope. But in any case, there's more out there than developing research questions, I think!
Noahpinion	725884320158760960	2016-04-29T03:08:02	I think Stiglitz is basically right. The "markets always work" faction is losing the younger generation.

Noahpinion	725068165286379520	2016-04-26T21:04:56	Has Chinese consumption been consistently underestimated? 
Noahpinion	725067415109947393	2016-04-26T21:01:57	salimfurth Why is the 80s so messy?
Noahpinion	725066126116397061	2016-04-26T20:56:50	salimfurth I think the question is how rapid wage growth really was in the 80s and 90s. But since 2000 is not a question.
Noahpinion	725063977567457280	2016-04-26T20:48:17	salimfurth Yes. But we can probably construct proxies from mean-median divergence of income before 1979.
Noahpinion	725063118787862528	2016-04-26T20:44:53	salimfurth I think we want to look at medians instead of means, focus on money wages per hour, and try several deflators.
Noahpinion	725060597277200384	2016-04-26T20:34:52	salimfurth To me this says: If you play with data sources, you can conclude that slow wage growth began much earlier than 2000.
Noahpinion	725060037723471876	2016-04-26T20:32:38	bryan_caplan At least, from recent lows!
Noahpinion	725056724248465408	2016-04-26T20:19:28	salimfurth That's still much lower than the average of previous decades, is my point. I would use PCE before CPI, btw.
Noahpinion	725056544019243008	2016-04-26T20:18:45	salimfurth Of course, a lot of that is because more and more of total compensation is now in the form of health premiums.
Noahpinion	725056375907311616	2016-04-26T20:18:05	salimfurth The more general point is, no matter what measure you use, there's been a big slowdown in median wage growth since 2000.
Noahpinion	725055164034486273	2016-04-26T20:13:16	salimfurth Well, use PCE then, or GDP deflator.
Noahpinion	725051145635414017	2016-04-26T19:57:18	salimfurth BPP is only since the crisis, but it has tracked CPI pretty closely, so you could proxy with CPI.
Noahpinion	725050489855967232	2016-04-26T19:54:42	salimfurth Or you can use weekly earnings for full-time employees:  Stagnation since 2000.

Noahpinion	725047493495558144	2016-04-26T19:42:47	salimfurth I don't know if those think tanks he cites actually disagree, but yes, broad-based wage stagnation is borne out by the data.

Noahpinion	723608551156011008	2016-04-22T20:24:57	DonskerClass Never mind, I was wrong, it was indeed GMM.
Noahpinion	723606349448384512	2016-04-22T20:16:12	DonskerClass Ah, that's right. Do you lose efficiency in finite samples, or only asymptotically?
Noahpinion	723605266554621956	2016-04-22T20:11:54	iarroyo48 Annaleen seanmcarroll Naive me thought it would be least squares.
Noahpinion	723605197906423808	2016-04-22T20:11:37	DonskerClass You can estimate ARIMA by stuff like least squares, tho.
Noahpinion	723604049573097472	2016-04-22T20:07:03	DonskerClass Really? Are they estimating the ARIMA by MLE?
Noahpinion	723601556050960385	2016-04-22T19:57:09	seanmcarroll Annaleen If "honesty" (transparency) can only be achieved by making assumptions simplistic, that can be a steep cost.
Noahpinion	723601354762137600	2016-04-22T19:56:21	seanmcarroll Annaleen Just like disclosure doesn't remove conflicts of interest, transparency doesn't make assumptions better.
Noahpinion	723600623741054976	2016-04-22T19:53:27	DSMoxon Seems like that.
Noahpinion	723599573160189952	2016-04-22T19:49:16	DSMoxon But knowing good from bad priors ex ante is impossible. So conclusion: Bayesian methods are sometimes better.
Noahpinion	723599431086555136	2016-04-22T19:48:42	seanmcarroll DSMoxon Annaleen It's true that we do make assumptions, but "honesty" is not always the most important consideration.
Noahpinion	723595016405438464	2016-04-22T19:31:10	DSMoxon seanmcarroll Annaleen Methods that make more assumptions will get more stuff right only when the assumptions are right.
Noahpinion	723594877573947393	2016-04-22T19:30:37	DSMoxon seanmcarroll Annaleen Yeah, it's not worse, just hard, so people often don't do it. Also, yeah, committing is an assumption.

Noahpinion	723594013484392448	2016-04-22T19:27:11	seanmcarroll Annaleen Yes, but A) you have to commit to one, and B) non-normal likelihoods are hard to use.

Noahpinion	722896381594116099	2016-04-20T21:15:02	reineramps You want to compare Sanders and FDR directly? FDR worked to free up trade, and didn't offer free college.

Noahpinion	722455311643238400	2016-04-19T16:02:23	MarketUrbanism Here is such a paper, by an old friend of mine: 
Noahpinion	722454306545270784	2016-04-19T15:58:23	MarketUrbanism No, so that it increases overall efficiency (and utility for the poor).
Noahpinion	722454080946184192	2016-04-19T15:57:30	MarketUrbanism So Tyler isn't provably wrong. He could be right. I just personally think he's not right.
Noahpinion	722453947605057537	2016-04-19T15:56:58	MarketUrbanism So, there are papers on this...it's possible for disamenity of density to be so severe that zoning is actually good.
Noahpinion	722453363023982593	2016-04-19T15:54:38	MarketUrbanism About disamenities, not clear. About fads, seems to me that they hurt the poor more when supply can't respond.
Noahpinion	722452930754838528	2016-04-19T15:52:55	MarketUrbanism We'd expect rents to go down less in cities with "consumption amenities" (sunlight, etc.). These also benefit the poor.
Noahpinion	722452533906550784	2016-04-19T15:51:21	MarketUrbanism Reason 2: If urban poor are better off than rural poor, and density shifts latter to former, poor as a whole are better off.
Noahpinion	722452287214366720	2016-04-19T15:50:22	MarketUrbanism Reason 1: If the urban poor see their rents increase but their real disposable incomes also increase, they're better off.

Noahpinion	722449383757733888	2016-04-19T15:38:50	smithsj The idea is: Allowing density increases local business activity, which raises property values and rents.

Noahpinion	721569674815668225	2016-04-17T05:23:11	dendisuhubdy cjreeves2011 The point is that *even if* the prior *was* normal, parameter uncertainty would still lead to fat tails.

Noahpinion	721042912138559488	2016-04-15T18:30:01	stianwestlake Ahh, yes. Things should be public before they're written about. BUT, this raises another interesting question...
Noahpinion	721042556109201408	2016-04-15T18:28:36	Which of these empirical papers is right about the effect of unemployment insurance?  
Noahpinion	721042232862576640	2016-04-15T18:27:19	stianwestlake Oh no, I cover working papers all the time, and I strongly believe in doing so.

Noahpinion	721041930449096704	2016-04-15T18:26:07	Mktsurfer mcantelon Yeah, we've got to push down our crazy infrastructure costs!
Noahpinion	721041840410001408	2016-04-15T18:25:45	DCosmology Yep. The question is, how much cash? And how much leverage is acceptable?
Noahpinion	721041185381289984	2016-04-15T18:23:09	stianwestlake s8mb What about working papers, which are just posted on a website?
Noahpinion	721040997120024576	2016-04-15T18:22:24	Mktsurfer mcantelon No, but I've been trying to advocate for more infrastructure spending and more infrastructure cost control.

Noahpinion	721039561036464128	2016-04-15T18:16:42	DCosmology In reality, there are probably regimes where we overestimate the prob of black swans and other regimes where we underestimate.
Noahpinion	721039405448704000	2016-04-15T18:16:05	Mktsurfer mcantelon I see. Well, build infrastructure. Fund it with property taxes (or with state money from sales or income taxes).
Noahpinion	721039128943419393	2016-04-15T18:14:59	s8mb stianwestlake What mechanisms other than peer review were you thinking of?
Noahpinion	721038912223772672	2016-04-15T18:14:07	DCosmology You can define probability as a prior rather than a frequency. That's why I talk about the Weitzman result!

Noahpinion	721038406180937728	2016-04-15T18:12:06	Mktsurfer mcantelon What is the rat syndrome?
Noahpinion	721038281010352128	2016-04-15T18:11:37	stianwestlake s8mb Then again, peer review is a horrendous quality filter, and serves mainly as a credit allocation system.
Noahpinion	721037738288349184	2016-04-15T18:09:27	DCosmology No it isn't! I make it clear that you often can't know the latter from the former.
Noahpinion	721037570398752768	2016-04-15T18:08:47	Mktsurfer mcantelon Not really...if prices fall because supply increases (i.e. we build more), it's capital creation!
Noahpinion	721036975575150593	2016-04-15T18:06:25	mcantelon Mktsurfer Yeah, I keep writing about that...we need to make cities build a lot more housing, so people can move there.
Noahpinion	721036696557477888	2016-04-15T18:05:19	Mktsurfer mcantelon Falling house prices shouldn't raise rents, though...right?
Noahpinion	721036516324036608	2016-04-15T18:04:36	costrike Where are you? Japan??
Noahpinion	721036003088031744	2016-04-15T18:02:33	Mktsurfer mcantelon Low housing prices should allow people to move more easily, at least in theory.
Noahpinion	721035734396706816	2016-04-15T18:01:29	Mktsurfer Yes. The worse our education system becomes, the more businesses need immigrants, and the more immigration hurts the native-born.
Noahpinion	721035555622903809	2016-04-15T18:00:47	costrike Could happen. Plus if we don't get a handle on global warming, things could get bad. But you know, there are always dangers!
Noahpinion	721035242132230144	2016-04-15T17:59:32	Mktsurfer So far that's always happened in the past, yeah. But in the future that could change, no one really knows.

Noahpinion	721034508582068224	2016-04-15T17:56:37	Mktsurfer Well then, seems like the problem was too many kids, not too many immigrants...?

Noahpinion	721023186070966272	2016-04-15T17:11:38	JWMason1 TheStalwart By interpreting "They" as meaning "Krugman/DeLong", Jacobin was putting words in your mouth, it seemed.
Noahpinion	721022753298513920	2016-04-15T17:09:54	JWMason1 TheStalwart See, that's what I thought you meant. But it seems Jacobin took "They" to mean "Krugman/DeLong".
Noahpinion	721021992028082176	2016-04-15T17:06:53	JWMason1 TheStalwart So JW, are you telling me that the "They" in this sentence is referring to Krugman/DeLong?

Noahpinion	717406201252679680	2016-04-05T17:39:01	lymanstoneky This is all stuff Krugman worked on. You might like this book, it's awesome: 
Noahpinion	717405495556898816	2016-04-05T17:36:13	lymanstoneky One thing you see is that smaller countries always have much higher ratios of trade to GDP. But don't always grow faster.
Noahpinion	717404478182264833	2016-04-05T17:32:10	lymanstoneky Yep. I think economists are now focusing on productivity spillovers more than in the past, so that's good.
Noahpinion	717404050686259201	2016-04-05T17:30:29	lymanstoneky Also, as a side note, observe that trade *declined* as a % of our GDP throughout our high-growth period.
Noahpinion	717403929676361728	2016-04-05T17:30:00	lymanstoneky If we want a huge second-order effect, we need external multipliers or productivity spillovers. That's the point.
Noahpinion	717403741196976128	2016-04-05T17:29:15	lymanstoneky I think you're just not understanding the point here. The first-order contribution of trade to GDP was small. Period.
Noahpinion	717403475789807616	2016-04-05T17:28:11	lymanstoneky Yeah but as we discussed earlier, standard models don't include that. Mechanically, trade was small (and declining!) % of GDP.
Noahpinion	717403147547729920	2016-04-05T17:26:53	lymanstoneky Or use imports/GDP (it'll be about the same). But don't add the two up! That's double-counting.
Noahpinion	717402923332841472	2016-04-05T17:26:00	lymanstoneky Don't add imports and exports before dividing by GDP, just use exports/GDP.
Noahpinion	717402731233693696	2016-04-05T17:25:14	lymanstoneky No, look at the graph you just sent. Exports/GDP was 5% from 1860-1960.
Noahpinion	717402378832482304	2016-04-05T17:23:50	lymanstoneky I mean, yes I believe that data, I just think 5% of GDP is SMALL, not large.
Noahpinion	717402161030664192	2016-04-05T17:22:58	lymanstoneky What? 5% of our GDP during our highest-growth years in the late 1800s and early 1900s? You're kidding me!
Noahpinion	717401548368666624	2016-04-05T17:20:32	lymanstoneky Oh sure: 
Noahpinion	717401231782641665	2016-04-05T17:19:16	lymanstoneky They're not common. Economists don't do much modeling of endogenous productivity growth in general, really.
Noahpinion	717401009622876160	2016-04-05T17:18:24	lymanstoneky But trade was always a pretty small % of our GDP. So most mainstream theories will say trade was a sideshow to our growth.
Noahpinion	717400777443008513	2016-04-05T17:17:28	lymanstoneky No, but he has other effects that make trade boost productivity. Anyway, models with those spillovers are rare.
Noahpinion	717400638376714240	2016-04-05T17:16:55	lymanstoneky But I don't trust those theories; I suspect trade *is* actually very important for development. But that is just my prior.
Noahpinion	717400456557780992	2016-04-05T17:16:12	lymanstoneky Most theories won't generate big external multipliers, so they lead to the conclusion that trade is usually a sideshow.
Noahpinion	717400233425043456	2016-04-05T17:15:18	lymanstoneky One such theory is Krugman's "New Economic Geography", which I love, but it's hardly the workhorse model.
Noahpinion	717400075358461952	2016-04-05T17:14:41	lymanstoneky So to conclude that trade is a big driver of growth you need large "external multipliers". For that you need a theory.
Noahpinion	717399896790159360	2016-04-05T17:13:58	lymanstoneky Problem is, mechanically - just looking at percentages - trade is only responsible for a small % of big-country growth.
Noahpinion	717398350593589248	2016-04-05T17:07:50	SorryToBeKurt Biannual should be easily good enough for studies of things like minwage, right? Those take years.
Noahpinion	717397921709228032	2016-04-05T17:06:07	lymanstoneky That isn't right. If trade has no causal relationship to development it could still be correlated with either one.
Noahpinion	717397573120561153	2016-04-05T17:04:44	lymanstoneky I mean, let's not conflate trade/GDP with the growth rate of trade/GDP.
Noahpinion	717397333827137537	2016-04-05T17:03:47	SorryToBeKurt This is encouraging:  When 2 unrelated surveys broadly agree it's a good sign for both.
Noahpinion	717396814446460930	2016-04-05T17:01:43	lymanstoneky "low" and "declining" are very different things, don't switch back and forth between levels and growth rates!
Noahpinion	717396679419297792	2016-04-05T17:01:11	lymanstoneky The question is what "low" means, but the U.S. is going to be your best example here.
Noahpinion	717396351655366658	2016-04-05T16:59:53	SeanMcElwee Oh, but they'll keep saying that even when there's a strong pro-intervention consensus! E.g. 
Noahpinion	717395750309593088	2016-04-05T16:57:30	lymanstoneky But wealth level also correlates strongly with the size of government, maybe big govt is what makes countries rich! :D
Noahpinion	717394549207764992	2016-04-05T16:52:43	lymanstoneky The fact is, nobody really knows how important trade is for the development of very large countries.

Noahpinion	714677077119774720	2016-03-29T04:54:27	8/Seventh, high tuition has turned students into finicky customers who make unreasonable demands: 
Noahpinion	714676958769111042	2016-03-29T04:53:59	7/Sixth, there is no institutionalized way to shrink research fields that run out of new things to discover (anthro? high-energy physics?).
Noahpinion	714676846047182848	2016-03-29T04:53:32	6/Fifth, tenure might be selecting a professoriate too risk-averse to make big new disoveries: 
Noahpinion	714676758407168000	2016-03-29T04:53:11	5/Fourth, shrinking productivity is a worry, given rising administrative costs whose benefits are unclear: 
Noahpinion	714676559030910976	2016-03-29T04:52:24	4/Third, there is a huge rich/poor gap in who applies to top colleges, which hurts equality of opportunity. This has proven hard to fix.
Noahpinion	714676478819102720	2016-03-29T04:52:05	3/Second, tuition is high, but pricing is the same for all majors, despite the fact that the wage premium differs hugely by major. Not fair.
Noahpinion	714676406068908032	2016-03-29T04:51:47	2/First, of course, is the huge and crushing burden of student loans, which many students seem to take on due to short-sightedness.

Noahpinion	714656163959189504	2016-03-29T03:31:21	balajis mims But if smartphones increase network externalities and make tastes more heterogeneous, they make Tiebout worse, not better.

Noahpinion	714655619941158912	2016-03-29T03:29:12	balajis mims You can reject self-interested individual rationality, sure. Many do. But what formal model can replace that?
Noahpinion	714655185834868736	2016-03-29T03:27:28	balajis mims Bewley result doesn't depend on general equilibrium, just Nash.

Noahpinion	712392556525461504	2016-03-22T21:36:35	The point of publicizing the fact that a trade deficit is a loan is to get people to think about the intertemporal choice aspect of trade.
Noahpinion	712392327096995840	2016-03-22T21:35:41	jm0rt asymptosis nick_bunker The point is that trade has an intertemporal aspect that people ignore.

Noahpinion	712357342411493376	2016-03-22T19:16:40	ryanavent I think the idea is to counter the lump of labor fallacy with an equal and opposite fallacy in the hopes that they'll cancel out.
Noahpinion	712356794480205824	2016-03-22T19:14:29	elidourado Yep. I think it's highly unlikely that all of that "dark matter" is real, but some of it is certainly real.

Noahpinion	712346619379757056	2016-03-22T18:34:03	Exactly. Free traders have been reduced to claiming that we get our daily bread from the benevolence of the baker. 
Noahpinion	712345516160356356	2016-03-22T18:29:40	"What's wrong with trade deficits? Don't you like getting free stuff?" is a thing that you actually hear people say fairly often!

Noahpinion	712337381647450112	2016-03-22T17:57:21	dandolfa That is an interesting case. Are we mis-accounting for the real value of financial services we provide to foreigners?
Noahpinion	712335451441369088	2016-03-22T17:49:40	dandolfa Sure.

Noahpinion	712330898922844160	2016-03-22T17:31:35	snlester You're still just thinking financially. Try to think in terms of real goods/services.
