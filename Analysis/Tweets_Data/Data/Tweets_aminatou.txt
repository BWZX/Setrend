aminatou	696715825957441536	2016-02-08T15:22:51	4. To suggest feminist critique is invalid be it was leveled similarly 8 years ago shows huge lack of comprehension of how sexism works.
aminatou	696715601792933890	2016-02-08T15:21:58	3. This argument is in &amp; of itself a pretty telling embodiment of a progressive lack of interest in/respect for feminist commentary.
