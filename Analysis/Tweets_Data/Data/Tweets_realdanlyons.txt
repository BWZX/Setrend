realdanlyons	724690756401766400	2016-04-25T20:05:15	.amyjccuddy what *is* culture? Not accoutrement like bean bag chairs, foosball tables. Something deeper. &amp; takes time to evolve?
realdanlyons	724690412942839808	2016-04-25T20:03:53	Dunno but maybe? Putting “Newsweek” in front of my name felt good. HBS feels same?  
realdanlyons	724690198693613568	2016-04-25T20:03:02	.nehminehms amyjccuddy That’s just wrong. 38? I’d cut off a toe to be 38 again.
realdanlyons	724690048982093826	2016-04-25T20:02:26	.amyjccuddy So hard to resist that urge to exploit though. In biz to make $, I can see why cos. do this. 
realdanlyons	724689674112000000	2016-04-25T20:00:57	.amyjccuddy Does Greek system in uni do same? Join frat or sorority based on “fit,” get label &amp; sense of identity? 
realdanlyons	724689310105112578	2016-04-25T19:59:30	.Nivo0o0 ProductHuntLIVE I don’t know what that is???
realdanlyons	724689214080716800	2016-04-25T19:59:07	.amyjccuddy because why? a desire to belong to something larger than yourself? have an identity given to you? 
realdanlyons	724688944311488513	2016-04-25T19:58:03	.amyjccuddy what do you think is difference between culture and cult?
realdanlyons	724688853714522112	2016-04-25T19:57:41	jackerhack Coming out this summer or fall, September at latest.
realdanlyons	724688596951814145	2016-04-25T19:56:40	I think it happens outside tech. Have heard similar stories about investment banks. Academia.  
realdanlyons	724688347982082048	2016-04-25T19:55:40	Yes. It’s endemic. Google, Apple, Facebook, et al. Sense of mission; shifted language; uniformity of opinion;  
realdanlyons	724688061741830144	2016-04-25T19:54:32	I was struck to see similarities between tech frat-cult life and, say, what L. Wright describes in “Going Clear." 
realdanlyons	724687826755923968	2016-04-25T19:53:36	Where is the line? Not sure. What I experienced often felt like a cult, and others said the same thing. 
realdanlyons	724687687899291648	2016-04-25T19:53:03	Great to know I could be of use! Kidding. I’m sorry.  
realdanlyons	724687422873853953	2016-04-25T19:52:00	&amp; the dreaded “culture fit,” as in, “Would I want to have a beer with this person after work.”  
realdanlyons	724687136163807233	2016-04-25T19:50:51	True! My biggest fear raising “ageism” issue was: “Now I’m admitting I’m old." 
realdanlyons	724686922245910528	2016-04-25T19:50:00	Another paradox: tech indy claims to be starved for talent. Meanwhile ppl go begging for jobs and can’t get one.  
realdanlyons	724686800661413888	2016-04-25T19:49:31	U can’t believe how many emails I’ve had recently from ppl asking pretty much that exact question.  
realdanlyons	724686628392964096	2016-04-25T19:48:50	I think there’s a huge disconnect and we’re heading toward a huge problem across the culture &amp; economy 
realdanlyons	724686464550866944	2016-04-25T19:48:11	joemckendrick So why are tech cos. pushing out workers at 40?
realdanlyons	724686312842911744	2016-04-25T19:47:35	Dleesta Has it? My sense is wealth is distributed less evenly today than 20 yrs ago
realdanlyons	724685978884026368	2016-04-25T19:46:16	urbie4 amyjccuddy In the months since I wrote that, 40 has become the new 65
realdanlyons	724685751036858369	2016-04-25T19:45:21	At 1st glance it sounds like TV writing room process — no bad ideas, throw lots out, build &amp; rebuild?  
realdanlyons	724685477786300416	2016-04-25T19:44:16	Dleesta BTW, outside of a relatively small % of people, even in Silicon Valley can most people retire at 40?
realdanlyons	724685362879143936	2016-04-25T19:43:49	Dleesta I want one of those career timelines. My gen entered workforce with 20th C. expectations. Missed that “rich by 40” thing
realdanlyons	724685143772901376	2016-04-25T19:42:56	amyjccuddy Just had to look up “design thinking.” But I think I get your point.
realdanlyons	724684698224566272	2016-04-25T19:41:10	paleofuture Even then I’ll have to keep working. I had kids late in life.
realdanlyons	724684604079280128	2016-04-25T19:40:48	So you “retire” or “graduate” at 50, but live to 90 — doing what?  
realdanlyons	724684396016599041	2016-04-25T19:39:58	Yet paradoxically as life expectancy gets longer, careers are getting shorter, i.e. you’re done at 40, or 50. 
realdanlyons	724684208917090304	2016-04-25T19:39:14	Well but that’s an important question. With longevity increasing should retirement age still be 65? Why not 75? 
realdanlyons	724684033624551424	2016-04-25T19:38:32	urbie4 amyjccuddy Yeah really “digital native” is a way of saying “born after 1980."
realdanlyons	724683833799487488	2016-04-25T19:37:44	I have come to think that a balance of ages would be ideal. But maybe that’s because I’m now in the “old” camp?  
realdanlyons	724683410384523268	2016-04-25T19:36:03	yuetsu CCPsychSvcs amyjccuddy TheBespokeCMO So do property values, actually becomes a factor in our town. So gross.
realdanlyons	724683301907259392	2016-04-25T19:35:37	amyjccuddy DanielCClarke When I was 25 I could not wait for all those boring old people to get out of my way and let make take over
realdanlyons	724683156448808960	2016-04-25T19:35:03	dinosponges Okay now stop that
realdanlyons	724683086768803840	2016-04-25T19:34:46	urbie4 amyjccuddy And that is extraordinary. Job postings specifying age range, or “recent college grad.” Or: “digital native."
realdanlyons	724682940580552705	2016-04-25T19:34:11	Dleesta Very true.
realdanlyons	724682694559453184	2016-04-25T19:33:12	amyjccuddy Why did it change? What happened?
realdanlyons	724682596299452417	2016-04-25T19:32:49	CCPsychSvcs amyjccuddy TheBespokeCMO We have 10 yr old twins, talk about this all the time. Schools focus on results, not curiosity
realdanlyons	724682230434504704	2016-04-25T19:31:22	amyjccuddy Before hubs my employers always had all ages. Was weird to see all 1 group. A co of all 60-yr-olds wd be equally weird, I think.
realdanlyons	724681951538479104	2016-04-25T19:30:15	amyjccuddy What are comparable stereotypes about the young?
realdanlyons	724681779416829952	2016-04-25T19:29:34	amyjccuddy 2-part stereotype: warm, but incompetent. right? But no wonder companies don’t want to hire. A bunch of friendly halfwits.
realdanlyons	724681474226688001	2016-04-25T19:28:22	amyjccuddy That surprised me, the x-culture, I thought it was a western phenomenon
realdanlyons	724681383940071424	2016-04-25T19:28:00	.amyjccuddy Is that one of the 2 you sent me? They’re both really good. Also was interested to find the bias across cultures.
realdanlyons	724681103135649792	2016-04-25T19:26:53	amyjccuddy Where does it originate in corporate world? Have things always been this way?
realdanlyons	724680965176614912	2016-04-25T19:26:20	amyjccuddy I want to talk about it too, I’ve read your work on it, it’s fascinating.
realdanlyons	724680900483645440	2016-04-25T19:26:05	TheBespokeCMO amyjccuddy Say more on that? Please?
realdanlyons	724680673383079936	2016-04-25T19:25:11	Backbayre Smart point
realdanlyons	724680583939497984	2016-04-25T19:24:49	amyjccuddy TheBespokeCMO Are there companies that do this? e.g.’s of that kind of culture. Must be. I need to do research
realdanlyons	724680240962908161	2016-04-25T19:23:28	amyjccuddy But that implies a tolerance of multiple POV, diversity not just of age, gender, race but diversity of opinion
realdanlyons	724680021386911746	2016-04-25T19:22:35	Backbayre Yes but how much can you charge each one? Cable has been overcharging all of us.
realdanlyons	724679821700272128	2016-04-25T19:21:48	dinosponges Nope
realdanlyons	724679741958197250	2016-04-25T19:21:29	amyjccuddy TheBespokeCMO Wd love if they did things just because it was the right thing to do. Not sure that will happen.
realdanlyons	724679642842583040	2016-04-25T19:21:05	Backbayre Their fighting it so long tells me their data suggests it’s a less lucrative model.
realdanlyons	724679567382855680	2016-04-25T19:20:47	Backbayre But I suspect if a la carte were more lucrative (based on their data) they would have embraced it sooner, more eagerly.
realdanlyons	724679451628474368	2016-04-25T19:20:19	Backbayre Let’s say they sell shows a la carte. Can they make as much as they did with just cable deals? I’m not sure.
realdanlyons	724679198271516672	2016-04-25T19:19:19	amyjccuddy Risk was lack of dissent, lack of debate, lack of POV. Things move fast but can race in wrong direction, unchecked.
realdanlyons	724679087260839937	2016-04-25T19:18:52	amyjccuddy My exp. at Hubs was that non-fitters were churned out quickly, joiners stayed, Kool-Aid kept getting stronger.
realdanlyons	724678867911364609	2016-04-25T19:18:00	TheBespokeCMO amyjccuddy Begins with believing that diversity = better financial returns.

realdanlyons	724678397801193472	2016-04-25T19:16:08	amyjccuddy Not sure what do you think? What is latest thinking at HBS and other B schools?
realdanlyons	724678204737331200	2016-04-25T19:15:22	Backbayre TV model is incredibly bloated and wasteful today. But also stuck in its ways. Resistant to change.
realdanlyons	724678074672013313	2016-04-25T19:14:51	Backbayre Like what happened to magazines, cable dollars turn to OTP dimes. Or pennies. Shows no longer have huge staffs, hangers-on
realdanlyons	724677952907161600	2016-04-25T19:14:22	Backbayre I think they’re the future, but won’t generate $$ like cable model did. TV about to get hit with huge wave of disruption
realdanlyons	724677727102574592	2016-04-25T19:13:28	patricknward amyjccuddy Lots of rolled eyes and side-eye glances. Is that what you mean?
realdanlyons	724677637206081537	2016-04-25T19:13:07	amyjccuddy I think it’s hard to make a telemarketing boiler room fun or fulfilling. It’s a grind.
realdanlyons	724677569342267392	2016-04-25T19:12:51	amyjccuddy Great question. Newsroom was always fun to me, but not fun &amp; games. Work was fun.
realdanlyons	724677213451354113	2016-04-25T19:11:26	amyjccuddy Unless you only want frat bros and sorority women. But everyone else (most of world) doesn’t want to work in a frat
realdanlyons	724677104017743872	2016-04-25T19:11:00	amyjccuddy Step one: stop using frat house as model for what a company should look like
