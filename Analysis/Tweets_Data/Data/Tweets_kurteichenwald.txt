kurteichenwald	704810395895144449	2016-03-01T23:27:47	fairflattaxnow U seem awfully angry about something that happened. I guess I shouldnt have told of the event so u didn't have to hear it.
kurteichenwald	704810128160088065	2016-03-01T23:26:43	fairflattaxnow ...look, if you don't like the story, pretend it didn't happen and move on. Life in the bubble is easier.

kurteichenwald	704804078908346368	2016-03-01T23:02:41	fairflattaxnow Perhaps I should be like Fox News and not report things that happen if they might make conservatives upset.
kurteichenwald	704803719125213184	2016-03-01T23:01:15	fairflattaxnow And....a guy who dismisses real events that just happened as somehow being biased cause..facts have a liberal bias, I guess?
kurteichenwald	704800269255593984	2016-03-01T22:47:33	True: TX poll worker says "GOP? Go right. Dem? To left." Names everyone's party w/o asking. I ask "How?" She says: "The GOPrs are all mean"

kurteichenwald	702985811461951488	2016-02-25T22:37:32	I have never accepted that GOP is driven by racism in its insanity about Obama. But with its latest invention of new rules re: SCOTUS, I do.

kurteichenwald	702984508140703745	2016-02-25T22:32:22	GOP yells "you lie" at Obama. Refuses, for 1st time, 2 hold budget hearings or meet SCOTUS nominee. Just call him uppity &amp; get it over with.
kurteichenwald	702983758396325888	2016-02-25T22:29:23	GOPrs: Just want to know new rules: When dems control the Senate, when do they get to not confirm SCOTUS justices of GOP prez? Just 4th yr?

kurteichenwald	702254426266800128	2016-02-23T22:11:17	So, let's see if I get this: The GOP is fighting to allow Donald Trump to pick the next SCOTUS justice? Yah, that'll sell.

kurteichenwald	702253211210510338	2016-02-23T22:06:27	lawhawk I agree. But it will happen. And, if one side is going to treat the constitution like toilet paper, everyone may as well.

kurteichenwald	702251968366940160	2016-02-23T22:01:31	Now that the SCOTUS is pure politics, and constitution abused beyond belief, no Democratic Senate should ever confirm ANY GOP nominee again.
kurteichenwald	702251649360748544	2016-02-23T22:00:15	Im curious when this "we won't consider any nominee in an election year" thing starts. If Scalia had died 2 months earlier? 4? 20? 4 years?

kurteichenwald	699429038876545025	2016-02-16T03:04:12	chasrmartin ...because there is a huge difference between "we ask u not to make recess SCOTUS appts" and "we will confirm no one."
kurteichenwald	699428890054258688	2016-02-16T03:03:36	chasrmartin Nothing to do with this. Dems were urging Eisenhower not to make recess appointments to SCOTUS. Is some blog saying different?

kurteichenwald	684839083290439680	2016-01-06T20:48:55	GeorgeLDuncan So next. The highest reason given for abortions is inability to afford and inability to work with a baby. Would u pay...
kurteichenwald	684838907901415424	2016-01-06T20:48:13	GeorgeLDuncan ...once ppl get out of making up terms - calling every zygote or fetus a baby - then the debate can move to rational ground.
kurteichenwald	684838790662246400	2016-01-06T20:47:46	GeorgeLDuncan Ok, then what about the 10,000 others? If a baby is a baby, why the difference? Again, I am only going after the silly words.

kurteichenwald	684837542173126657	2016-01-06T20:42:48	GeorgeLDuncan U don't get to change the reality. One or the other - the babies or the fetuses (babies u call them.) Impossible to save both
kurteichenwald	684837359762800640	2016-01-06T20:42:04	GeorgeLDuncan ...at 20 weeks, ur question reaches levels of reasonable debate. At 14, it does not.

kurteichenwald	684836009301819392	2016-01-06T20:36:42	GeorgeLDuncan U arent seriously saying a 12  week old fetus can hear or learn in the womb, are you? And if u believe that, why not save em?
kurteichenwald	684835722268819456	2016-01-06T20:35:34	GeorgeLDuncan Actually we don't. DEFINITELY not at 12 weeks. Biologically impossible. But if u believe that, why no save fetuses from fire?
kurteichenwald	684835347105099776	2016-01-06T20:34:05	GeorgeLDuncan ..the point is not to argue against your position on abortion. it's to expose the silly equivalency of calling a fetus a baby

kurteichenwald	684213904247898112	2016-01-05T03:24:41	LeftyBollocks So, like I said, the GOP has been lying when they say enforcing the laws on the books would solve the problem? Good to know.
kurteichenwald	684213246501376000	2016-01-05T03:22:04	LeftyBollocks So, u think better enforcing laws on the books does nothing to help fix the problem? So the GOP has been lying? Good to know.
