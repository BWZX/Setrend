TomHale_	720994113240305665	2016-04-15T15:16:06	fwred jonathanalgar yes the idea is Atlante raises debt, point is anyone who might lend to them has a better investment through NPL scheme
TomHale_	720993893634977792	2016-04-15T15:15:14	jonathanalgar fwred would be an odd investment - a loan to a fund that could buy anything from low-risk NPL tranches to regional equities
TomHale_	720993732317822976	2016-04-15T15:14:35	jonathanalgar fwred yes also thought that, but senior secur tranches are already wrapped with a guarantee
TomHale_	720993537072959488	2016-04-15T15:13:49	fwred jonathanalgar which funds?
TomHale_	720992581568622597	2016-04-15T15:10:01	fwred jonathanalgar yes but why would they make a loan to the fund rather than just buy the senior securitisation tranches?
