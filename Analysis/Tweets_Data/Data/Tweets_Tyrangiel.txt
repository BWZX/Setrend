Tyrangiel	714075573589413892	2016-03-27T13:04:18	16/ Restraint in journalism is a virtue. Except in columns or on 24-hour cable news. So, you know, caveat emptor on that.
Tyrangiel	714075572956082180	2016-03-27T13:04:18	15/ And it’s undoable/not worth doing if we insult readers or render verdicts.
Tyrangiel	714075572440158208	2016-03-27T13:04:18	14/ Because the job of informing, as ridiculous as it sometimes seems in the web age, really is important.
Tyrangiel	714075571911700481	2016-03-27T13:04:17	13/ Whether it’s Trump or anti-LGBT laws or Batman vs. Superman, there’s a line they don’t want to cross.

Tyrangiel	714075570586279936	2016-03-27T13:04:17	11/ But most are doing very well within a paradox: they present facts &amp; presume people will see what's what.
Tyrangiel	714075570028478464	2016-03-27T13:04:17	10/ Maybe Kristof’s right and some reporters could have been more aggressive early in Trump’s campaign, or be more aggressive now.

Tyrangiel	714075568472399873	2016-03-27T13:04:17	8/ The instinct is to ease off the throttle—to note facts and let the phenomena speak for itself.
