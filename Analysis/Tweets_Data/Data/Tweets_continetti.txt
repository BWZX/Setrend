continetti	696457805012856837	2016-02-07T22:17:34	Today is FreeBeacon's 4th birthday. We're the age of an angry toddler, throwing Play-Doh at the enemies of freedom. 
continetti	696187193342173184	2016-02-07T04:22:16	SonnyBunch You thought for two years that Rand Paul would be the nominee.
continetti	696185672680546308	2016-02-07T04:16:13	John Kasich has a one-state campaign. A top-two finish in New Hampshire for him would further complicate things 
continetti	696185390450012163	2016-02-07T04:15:06	The question is whether the people who like Donald Trump actually vote for him. They didn't in Iowa. Will they in NH 
continetti	696185186522951680	2016-02-07T04:14:17	If you liked Donald Trump going into this debate, he gave you no reason to change your mind. My take 
continetti	696184885573242880	2016-02-07T04:13:05	Rubio survived Christie's brutal assault, b/c Christie's manner so aggressive likely to turn undecideds from him too 
continetti	696184276979732480	2016-02-07T04:10:40	In previous debates Rubio has been deadly with a counterpunch. In this debate he missed. My take 
continetti	696183933931778048	2016-02-07T04:09:18	Christie bruised Marco Rubio tonight. But Rubio survived. My take 
continetti	696183165426094081	2016-02-07T04:06:15	Bottom line. Rubio is scripted, but he has the right message on issues GOP voters care about - solid tonight on foreign policy and pro-life
continetti	696175028023513090	2016-02-07T03:33:55	I like Peyton too, but doesn't Jeb's answer validate Trump's critique of GOP donor class buying support of polls?

continetti	696150263955062784	2016-02-07T01:55:31	Christie is very desperate, and very dangerous
continetti	696150088809230336	2016-02-07T01:54:49	To be fair, security/terrorism is top issue for NH voters; immigration a close third behind the economy. GOPDebate
