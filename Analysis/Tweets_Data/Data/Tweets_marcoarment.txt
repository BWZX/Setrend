marcoarment	718582862518337537	2016-04-08T23:34:39	red_scott Differences also don‚Äôt apply equally to all frequencies. High-freq. noise outside the area gets more aggressively cut by super.
marcoarment	718582446867025920	2016-04-08T23:33:00	red_scott In a very small area, yes, but both lobes of pickup area are tighter and pickup falls off faster than the cardioid‚Äôs single lobe.
marcoarment	718581702822666240	2016-04-08T23:30:03	red_scott A is supercardioid, C is cardioid. So C picks up more: a wider area in front of the mic, and a bit more room noise along with it.
