Ken_Rosenthal	718158382033555456	2016-04-07T19:27:55	eznark think you are misinterpreting. Not saying get rid of draft or even pools. Saying they need to curb disincentives. Not that radical.
Ken_Rosenthal	718156363965149184	2016-04-07T19:19:54	eznark BadgerNoonan Second paragraph and last paragraph.
Ken_Rosenthal	718132097999736832	2016-04-07T17:43:29	TedgeEBear thanks - and as you can see, I'm with you!

Ken_Rosenthal	718116859879538688	2016-04-07T16:42:56	TedgeEBear I wrote previously about that. 
Ken_Rosenthal	718115877036621824	2016-04-07T16:39:01	TedgeEBear Read the first paragraph again.
Ken_Rosenthal	718115763270365188	2016-04-07T16:38:34	TedgeEBear WHAT line of thinking? I’m talking about a flaw in the CBA, nothing more.
Ken_Rosenthal	718102829475446784	2016-04-07T15:47:10	nereptiles And in same article, I said they should tweak the system. Read it again.
Ken_Rosenthal	718100974934601729	2016-04-07T15:39:48	Matt_Winkelman Yes, and that dynamic always will exist. But read what I wrote. The way system works, disparities in slots getting greater.
Ken_Rosenthal	718099513890717697	2016-04-07T15:34:00	Matt_Winkelman I’m talking about the disparity assigned bonuses. They DO provide even greater incentive.

Ken_Rosenthal	710944293427527685	2016-03-18T21:41:42	CharmianNeary How do we know anyone wants to buck Chris Sale? The larger issue, it seems from the players' reactions, is Williams.
Ken_Rosenthal	710944046932488197	2016-03-18T21:40:44	CindyPerry6 If players complained, Williams should say that.

Ken_Rosenthal	710943353454526464	2016-03-18T21:37:58	CharmianNeary I am sure there are mixed feelings. But they have presented an awfully United front. And by the way, I liked kids even at 24!

Ken_Rosenthal	710905348140437504	2016-03-18T19:06:57	mlharvey26 What are you talking about. Sale talked today, and Reinsdorf and LaRoche issued statements.

Ken_Rosenthal	710903850488741888	2016-03-18T19:01:00	My original report was that KW told LaRoche that he could no longer bring son into clubhouse. KW said he merely asked LaRoche to scale back.
Ken_Rosenthal	710902635914772481	2016-03-18T18:56:10	LaRoche said that Williams first asked him to scale back Drake’s presence and, “Later, I was told not to bring him to the ballpark at all.”
Ken_Rosenthal	710901312142123008	2016-03-18T18:50:55	Given the suddenness of my departure and the stir it has caused in both the media and the clubhouse, I feel (cont)

Ken_Rosenthal	710648916597837824	2016-03-18T02:07:59	BurkerKing85 That was the very first report. I quoted Williams on what you are saying minutes later.

Ken_Rosenthal	710524562127982592	2016-03-17T17:53:51	Sale told Williams, unequivocally, to get out of the clubhouse and stay out, per a source. Williams acknowledges meeting was passionate. 2/2
Ken_Rosenthal	710524557543624704	2016-03-17T17:53:50	As jeffpassan said, Sale was vocal in meeting between WhiteSox players and Williams on LaRoche. 1/2

Ken_Rosenthal	710276579734073344	2016-03-17T01:28:27	Those of you who say the WhiteSox players complained about LaRoche’s son being in clubhouse should read this: 
Ken_Rosenthal	710255471450415104	2016-03-17T00:04:34	robglove1 Never said otherwise.
Ken_Rosenthal	710244281114464256	2016-03-16T23:20:06	More support for LaRoche 
Ken_Rosenthal	710225822448103424	2016-03-16T22:06:46	Agent's point is that the room is players' domain. If they are comfortable with sons in clubhouse, fine. If not, also fine. But their call.
Ken_Rosenthal	710225798469255168	2016-03-16T22:06:40	Player agent offered interesting take on LaRoche, WhiteSox. Said rules on sons in clubhouse should be determined by players, not execs.
Ken_Rosenthal	710213747189665792	2016-03-16T21:18:47	On WhiteSox vs. LaRoche. Column:...

Ken_Rosenthal	710185115868073989	2016-03-16T19:25:00	Just talked to White Sox president Ken Williams. Here is what he told me about LaRoche:  "There has been no... 
Ken_Rosenthal	710182825836711936	2016-03-16T19:15:54	Source: LaRoche told WhiteSox yesterday he would take a “couple of days” before making final decision on retirement.

Ken_Rosenthal	710181386380947456	2016-03-16T19:10:11	LaRoche’s son, Drake, 14, has traveled with him for several years. Adam, in a Chicago Tribune story last year, called him team’s “26th man.”
Ken_Rosenthal	710181381834297344	2016-03-16T19:10:10	Sources: LaRoche chose to retire after WhiteSox prez Ken Williams told him that he no longer could bring 14-year-old son into clubhouse.

Ken_Rosenthal	693209196804722688	2016-01-29T23:08:46	It already was obvious, but Kendrick’s contract is most striking evidence yet that the qualifying-offer system needs to change in next CBA.

Ken_Rosenthal	687673639135776769	2016-01-14T16:32:26	Oops! Here is the news from the man himself. 
Ken_Rosenthal	687673506931314689	2016-01-14T16:31:55	Agent change: The Twins’ Miguel Sano has joined Roc Nation Sports, according to a source.

Ken_Rosenthal	687626638125842436	2016-01-14T13:25:40	Dodgers intend for Jordan Schafer to try pitching after he agreed to minor-league contract, source says.

Ken_Rosenthal	687456257184272384	2016-01-14T02:08:38	Guaranteed portion of Gordon deal with Marlins covers remaining three years of arbitration and two years of free agency.

Ken_Rosenthal	687416908417773573	2016-01-13T23:32:17	News of Mets possibly pursuing Cespedes on short-term deal was reported earlier today by jonheyman.
Ken_Rosenthal	687416581509525508	2016-01-13T23:30:59	Agents have not given Mets any indication that Cespedes would accept deal of 1, 2 or 3 years. Cespedes remains committed to longer term.
Ken_Rosenthal	687416576446967809	2016-01-13T23:30:58	Sources: For Mets to engage on Cespedes, they would need to hear from his agents that he is willing to entertain short-term deal…
Ken_Rosenthal	687394878326706180	2016-01-13T22:04:44	Yes, Braves could trade Inciarte - if they believed Cespedes could play CF. They then could move a corner OFer later, once Smith was ready.
Ken_Rosenthal	687394372971851776	2016-01-13T22:02:44	Reported in Sept. that Braves liked Cespedes - but that was before they put Olivera in LF. Would need to trade OFer to make it happen now.
Ken_Rosenthal	687378405503942656	2016-01-13T20:59:17	Source: SFGiants trade RHP Cody Hall to DBacks. Had been designated for assignment.

Ken_Rosenthal	685671282873085952	2016-01-09T03:55:47	As others have noted, Nationals will control Revere for two seasons, BlueJays will control Storen for one.
Ken_Rosenthal	685670998558031873	2016-01-09T03:54:39	Source: Cash going from Nationals to BlueJays in trade will even out difference in salaries between Storen and Revere.
Ken_Rosenthal	685669074467184640	2016-01-09T03:47:01	Like this trade for everyone. BlueJays needed reliever, were deep in OFers. Nationals needed LH hitting OFer. Storen needed change.
Ken_Rosenthal	685667817774006273	2016-01-09T03:42:01	Deal is official. Nats get Revere and player to be named later while Blue Jays gets Storen and cash.
Ken_Rosenthal	685666308386631681	2016-01-09T03:36:01	BlueJays leadoff options become Pompey, Saunders, Travis (once healthy) ... or Tulo, who did so 26 times in 2015.
Ken_Rosenthal	685664134365601793	2016-01-09T03:27:23	Revere fills Nationals’ need for LH hitting outfielder who can play center and left. No need to trade Gio for that piece now or FA signing.
Ken_Rosenthal	685663634069020672	2016-01-09T03:25:24	Revere projected to earn $6.7M in arbitration by MLBTradeRumors, Storen $8.8M.

Ken_Rosenthal	685514105285914624	2016-01-08T17:31:13	Signing Ramirez also would enable Padres to keep 2nd-round pick (1st pick, No. 8 overall, is protected). SD could get six picks in top 100.

Ken_Rosenthal	684920318343950339	2016-01-07T02:11:43	In theory, Rangers could acquire another SP, then trade Gonzalez for Ozuna. Problem is that TEX lacks flexibility to increase payroll.
Ken_Rosenthal	684920310915821569	2016-01-07T02:11:41	Marlins, per clarkspencer, have talked Ozuna for RHP Chi Chi Gonzalez and maybe one more. But Rangers need to add pitching, not subtract.
Ken_Rosenthal	684920306545356801	2016-01-07T02:11:40	Sources: Talks between Rangers and Marlins on Ozuna, on and off for the past month, have yet to significantly advance.

Ken_Rosenthal	684862244631527424	2016-01-06T22:20:57	Previously, candidates had to be retired 21 years to be considered by HOF era committees. Now, it's 16 years (due to shorter BBWAA term).
Ken_Rosenthal	684861841575657472	2016-01-06T22:19:21	HOF note: Recent rule change would allow Trammell, Whitaker, and Morris to be considered by Veterans Committee in December 2016.
Ken_Rosenthal	684846542595997696	2016-01-06T21:18:34	Orioles also like Upton, but it’s unclear whether they truly want him or Cespedes. Might simply be seeking leverage with Chris Davis.
Ken_Rosenthal	684846536115810308	2016-01-06T21:18:32	Rangers also like Upton beyond one year: Beltre, team’s only real RH power, entering final year of deal. But again, budget an obstacle.
Ken_Rosenthal	684846531271372801	2016-01-06T21:18:31	Sources: Rangers interested in JUpton on one-year contract, but budget an issue. Upton plans to keep exploring market, seeking longer deal.

Ken_Rosenthal	684806105386618880	2016-01-06T18:37:53	Regarding what I just said about Griffey: All voters SHOULD reveal and explain ballots. Part of our obligation, in my opinion.
Ken_Rosenthal	684805062128988160	2016-01-06T18:33:44	I voted for Griffey. But it’s possible a voter might make a strategic choice and leave him off ballot to vote for someone else. Not a crime.
