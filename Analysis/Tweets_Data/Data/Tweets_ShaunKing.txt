ShaunKing	720817071618134016	2016-04-15T03:32:36	Frances_Fisher so biased.
ShaunKing	720816991301459968	2016-04-15T03:32:17	Not once tonight did Hillary Clinton even give a substantive reason as to why she refuses to release the transcripts to her speeches.
ShaunKing	720816850976776192	2016-04-15T03:31:44	You know and I know that if the transcripts to Hillary's speeches to Wall Street were benign that she would've already released them.
ShaunKing	720816642180128768	2016-04-15T03:30:54	The absolute low moment for Hillary tonight was when she was cornered about the transcripts for her paid speeches to Wall Street. Was ugly.

ShaunKing	720786421125103616	2016-04-15T01:30:49	ABSOLUTELY.  She claims all of Bill's highlights and shuns every single negative part of Bill's legacy.  
ShaunKing	720786143873265664	2016-04-15T01:29:42	Hillary Clinton absolutely has not been a leader in the FightFor15. Shocking to hear her say that. It's simply not true.

ShaunKing	720784163087978496	2016-04-15T01:21:50	It is hard to watch Hillary Clinton duck and dodge and duck and dodge and duck and dodge on the transcripts to her speeches.
ShaunKing	720784046385676289	2016-04-15T01:21:22	It is abundantly clear that Hillary Clinton is scared to death to release the transcripts to her Goldman Sachs speeches.
ShaunKing	720783787802632194	2016-04-15T01:20:21	Hillary was just asked, "if there is nothing in those speeches to Goldman Sachs, why not release the transcripts?"

ShaunKing	720782823125344256	2016-04-15T01:16:31	Let's be clear.  Wall Street decision makers are big donors to the Hillary Clinton campaign.   She's shown no desire to take them on.
ShaunKing	720782564181569536	2016-04-15T01:15:29	Bernie is right.   When GoldmanSachs has to make a $5,000,000,000 settlement for fraud, that means they are in the FRAUD BUSINESS.
ShaunKing	720781787857883139	2016-04-15T01:12:24	Dear Hillary,  If you are serious about taking on Wall Street, please show us the transcripts of your paid speeches to them.
ShaunKing	720781553547264000	2016-04-15T01:11:28	Did Hillary just say no evidence exists in Bernie's attacks on her?   She DID vote for the war in Iraq.  She does receive SuperPAC money.

ShaunKing	720780477481775108	2016-04-15T01:07:11	I do question her judgement. I question her judgement for voting the war in Iraq, for bad trade agreements, &amp; for having Super PACS.  Bernie

ShaunKing	718525937411874816	2016-04-08T19:48:27	Well said, zachdcarter: Nothing Bill Clinton Said To Defend His Welfare Reform Is True 
ShaunKing	718455423490199552	2016-04-08T15:08:15	After months of running from crime bill &amp; welfare "reform," B Clinton finally defended it--by relying on falsehoods. 
ShaunKing	718373990922915840	2016-04-08T09:44:40	Both of these headlines from the same exact paper. WaPo  
ShaunKing	718516409425391617	2016-04-08T19:10:36	Challenge Bill or Hillary Clinton and see if the privilege and anger doesn't begin seeping out of their pores.
ShaunKing	718516239992233984	2016-04-08T19:09:55	I think what both Bill and Hillary have taught us that they LOVE Black folk who don't challenge them. Love them to pieces.
ShaunKing	718516119380828160	2016-04-08T19:09:26	Go and read where Bill Clinton is quoted as saying Obama would've been carrying his bags a few years ago.   No he wouldn't have.
ShaunKing	718516012749074432	2016-04-08T19:09:01	Go back and watch in '08 when Bill Clinton compared Obama to Jesse Jackson.
ShaunKing	718515905492348929	2016-04-08T19:08:35	But here's the thing - the question really becomes, can a man play the jazz sax on Arsenio and still have racist tendencies?   Of course.
ShaunKing	718515719877603328	2016-04-08T19:07:51	In fact, most of what Bill Clinton said is said often by conservatives and white supremacists - particularly his Black on Black crime trope.
ShaunKing	718515565996978176	2016-04-08T19:07:14	Not only that, Bill then decided to throw BlackLivesMatter under the bus in a way that I've heard white supremacists do for 2 years.
ShaunKing	718515299964841984	2016-04-08T19:06:11	ShaunKing He was pretty clear. Opposing the crime bill means you support  crack-addicted assassin children in our streets.
ShaunKing	718515281010814976	2016-04-08T19:06:07	Bill Clinton gave a full fledged defense to his disastrous welfare reform efforts. Without apology. He was proud.
ShaunKing	718515104267005952	2016-04-08T19:05:24	Bill Clinton gave a full fledged defense to the crime bill. Suggested he was incredibly proud of it actually.
ShaunKing	718514894002397184	2016-04-08T19:04:34	Yesterday was not a gaffe for Bill Clinton. He was confident, clear, and fully articulate. He said what he meant and meant what he said.
ShaunKing	718514749684719616	2016-04-08T19:04:00	I think it was Bill Clinton's dismissive and condescending tone that disturbed me just as much.
ShaunKing	718514368040812544	2016-04-08T19:02:29	While I am fully disturbed at what Bill Clinton said, defending the crime bill, defending welfare reform, and the super-predators term....
ShaunKing	718514239472812032	2016-04-08T19:01:58	The truth is that Democrats would be almost universally outraged if Donald Trump had said what Bill Clinton said yesterday.

ShaunKing	718276644130185216	2016-04-08T03:17:51	Some Black folk love the Clintons so much that they can do virtually no wrong in their eyes. Rush to their defense no matter what.

ShaunKing	716985655633526786	2016-04-04T13:47:55	In my opinion, what the BernieSanders campaign has proven is that millions of Americans want to go in a completely different direction.
ShaunKing	716985450725056512	2016-04-04T13:47:07	Has any Democratic candidate ever been so successful while being so soundly rejected by the political establishment? I don't think so.

ShaunKing	715651855309791232	2016-03-31T21:27:53	A Christianity defined by what and who to avoid is but a hollow shell, an empty wrapper.
ShaunKing	715648584406982656	2016-03-31T21:14:53	I conclude with this...  Saying that you are a Christian has very little to do with actually being a Christian.  We have few Christians.
ShaunKing	715648339199594501	2016-03-31T21:13:54	Even if one believed homosexuality is a sin, the Bible says God "hates" lying and that it is an "abomination". Will the state ban it too?

ShaunKing	715646873231605764	2016-03-31T21:08:05	In all four Gospels, Jesus openly loves, touches, serves, feeds, and blesses people who society has deemed outcasts and untouchable.

ShaunKing	715646266114498562	2016-03-31T21:05:40	Sadly, in Mississippi's new anti-LGBT Bill, HB1523, its authors basically blame their Christian faith for the new hateful policies.

ShaunKing	715575110774747138	2016-03-31T16:22:55	Knowing that they can no longer pass laws to prohibit gay marriage, states across the South are rushing to pass new bills against LGBT folk.
ShaunKing	715574904205221888	2016-03-31T16:22:06	See, in previous decades, conservatives campaigned on their hate for Black folk. That's no longer PC. Today it's Muslims, immigrants, &amp; LGBT
ShaunKing	715574691264610304	2016-03-31T16:21:15	When Obamacare started to work and was basically held up by the SCOTUS and gay marriage became the law, they needed something new to HATE.
ShaunKing	715574350729109504	2016-03-31T16:19:54	Just a few months ago, conservatives were so afraid, terrified even, that they rallied behind their hate of Syrian Refugees. Remember?
ShaunKing	715574175272927233	2016-03-31T16:19:12	Conservatives, for the past few decades, particularly right before a presidential election, have claimed to HATE gay marriage.
ShaunKing	715573994267787264	2016-03-31T16:18:29	Conservatives hate Obamacare so much that RealBenCarson said it's the "worst thing in America since slavery."   He really said that.
ShaunKing	715573818711011329	2016-03-31T16:17:47	For instance, conservatives absolutely HATE Obamacare. It's a proxy for their hate of Obama. Obamacare is a website with private insurance.
ShaunKing	715573574363439104	2016-03-31T16:16:49	Conservatives are widely known for what (and sometimes who) they HATE. It often is the primary driver of their political campaigns.
ShaunKing	715573350903496705	2016-03-31T16:15:56	Mississippi has just successfully out-bigoted North Carolina. They have a history of doing that very well. HB1523 is absolutely terrible.
ShaunKing	715573056178155520	2016-03-31T16:14:45	Please allow me to break down what Mississippi has just done by passing HB1523 by giving it context.   It's far reaching and despicable.
ShaunKing	715572768625008644	2016-03-31T16:13:37	I am dedicating the next 24 hours of my social media to exposing and fighting Mississippi's HB1523 - the harshest anti-LGBT law nationwide.

ShaunKing	715213641918902272	2016-03-30T16:26:34	When you hear Democrats addressing bigotry, is it not almost always as something that exists OUTSIDE of the party?
ShaunKing	715213130322804736	2016-03-30T16:24:32	The Democratic Party speaks of bigotry racism, anti-Muslim, anti-LGBT, anti-immigrant sentiments like they're an outside poison. They aren't
ShaunKing	715212755150774272	2016-03-30T16:23:03	In North Carolina, over a dozen Democrats voted FOR the anti-LBGT bill that is now law there. Yes, conservatives pushed, but Dems supported.
ShaunKing	715212260717760517	2016-03-30T16:21:05	The Crime Bill was perhaps the most destructive and bigoted policy of our lifetime. Fully and enthusiastically supported by Democrats.
ShaunKing	715212094421995520	2016-03-30T16:20:25	What I am saying is that as we talk about bigotry in America, a sole focus on conservatives isn't just wrong, it's foolhardy.
ShaunKing	715210419204399104	2016-03-30T16:13:46	It may be easy to blame bigotry on Trump, but do you know what percentage of Fortune 500 CEO's are Black?  Just 1%.  Just 5 out of 500.
ShaunKing	715209959001161730	2016-03-30T16:11:56	Some of the worst, most flagrant, most bigoted DA's in America, including in St. Louis, are lifelong Democrats.
ShaunKing	715209306925363200	2016-03-30T16:09:21	Do you know how many Black Democrats serve in the US Senate?  One.  Same as Republicans.  2 total out of 100.  Despicable.

ShaunKing	715208645492006913	2016-03-30T16:06:43	I believe this proposed ban of Muslims is the most dangerous, despicable, bigoted American policy proposal in decades. And it's popular.
ShaunKing	715208311965134848	2016-03-30T16:05:24	The new poll, for the first time, shows that a MAJORITY of Americans want to ban Muslims from entering the country.
ShaunKing	715208047149322240	2016-03-30T16:04:21	This new poll showing 35% of Democrats want to ban Muslims from entering the country isn't an anomaly. Every poll since December says this.
ShaunKing	715207086980866048	2016-03-30T16:00:32	A new poll determined that 34% of Democrats actually support banning Muslims from entering the United States. That's MILLIONS of Democrats
ShaunKing	715206777902596096	2016-03-30T15:59:18	American Democrats are deeply bigoted and xenophobic.
ShaunKing	715206552647548928	2016-03-30T15:58:24	However, in the rush to cover the rampant racism, bigotry, anti-immigrant, and anti-Muslim campaign of Trump, one group is getting a pass.
ShaunKing	715206335579758592	2016-03-30T15:57:32	The bigotry of Donald Trump deserves a great deal of attention. His words and deeds have caused violence and actually endanger our country.

ShaunKing	714876656352157696	2016-03-29T18:07:31	Makes me sick 
ShaunKing	714877654537801728	2016-03-29T18:11:29	. benshapiro Because you seemed to ONLY care about violence at Trump events when it happened to a woman you knew. Then you cared.
ShaunKing	714877492457259008	2016-03-29T18:10:50	. benshapiro also why I said when you WERE there you said absolutely NOTHING about this. Did it matter to you?

ShaunKing	714875799980081152	2016-03-29T18:04:07	. benshapiro - why did you say absolutely NOTHING when you were at Breitbart about a Black woman assaulted at a Trump rally. Stone silent.
ShaunKing	714875310613860352	2016-03-29T18:02:10	To be clear, I am glad Trump's campaign manager was assaulted, NOW arrested those who assaulted Shiya Nwanguma in Kentucky at his rally.
ShaunKing	714875124177043456	2016-03-29T18:01:25	What's clear with MichelleFields is that if a white woman gets her armed yanked, charges get filed. Period. Black woman assaulted, nah.
ShaunKing	714874797612773376	2016-03-29T18:00:08	Why have THESE MEN not been arrested?   You know &amp; I know if the men were Black &amp; the woman was white they would've 
ShaunKing	714874269877084160	2016-03-29T17:58:02	On the day Shiya Nwanguma was repeatedly assaulted at a Trump rally, Breitbart &amp; MichelleFields seemed to not to care even a little bit.
ShaunKing	714873852287979522	2016-03-29T17:56:22	Also, it is deeply troubling how silent MichelleFields &amp; her conservative colleagues were when Black women were assaulted at Trump rallies.
ShaunKing	714873564818759680	2016-03-29T17:55:14	In light of MichelleFields why has no one been arrested for assaulting a young Black woman at a Trump rally?

ShaunKing	714830718682152960	2016-03-29T15:04:58	Bakari_Sellers Superdelegates maybe should not be able to say what they are doing until it actually comes time to vote then.

ShaunKing	714830247787671554	2016-03-29T15:03:06	_CasuallyMe Right. But to see it happen is wild is what I am saying.

ShaunKing	714830029239267329	2016-03-29T15:02:14	Bakari_Sellers What I am saying is that in Idaho in Washington State, those superdelegates are doing their own voters a real disservice.
ShaunKing	714829912771846144	2016-03-29T15:01:46	Bakari_Sellers Brother I am not here to dispute the facts. I don't have to admit that. Facts are facts.
ShaunKing	714829776469549056	2016-03-29T15:01:14	Bakari_Sellers superdelegates are absolutely going against the will of the voters in their states.
ShaunKing	714829424093503488	2016-03-29T14:59:50	Bakari_Sellers My primary argument is that it is outrageous for superdelegates in the states where Bernie won by a landslide to go for her
ShaunKing	714829261107027968	2016-03-29T14:59:11	Bakari_Sellers Will you admit that it is outrageous for him to win EVERY county in a state, but still lose every superdelegate? Bananas.
ShaunKing	714829053694443521	2016-03-29T14:58:21	Bakari_Sellers BernieSanders first, for onlookers, let me say again that you and I are friends. Now, let me respond.
ShaunKing	714828917304135680	2016-03-29T14:57:49	Anyway, I share my current thoughts about the election in longform here.  Superdelegates are fundamentally a farce.  
ShaunKing	714828572280668160	2016-03-29T14:56:27	Never, has EVERY major politician in several states endorsed one democratic candidate and that candidate then LOSE by a landslide to another
ShaunKing	714828310593814530	2016-03-29T14:55:24	What we are seeing has not happened in our lifetime. It hasn't.
ShaunKing	714828132935720960	2016-03-29T14:54:42	Do you know what it means for BernieSanders to BLOW away Clinton in a state where literally EVERY politician in that state endorsed her?
ShaunKing	714827853603454978	2016-03-29T14:53:35	In Washington State, the governor, both senators, and almost every congressman supported Clinton.  STILL...  Bernie won every single county.
ShaunKing	714827408650665985	2016-03-29T14:51:49	Bernie, for all intents and purposes, is running as a grassroots activist.  Almost ZERO support from party leaders &amp; officials.
ShaunKing	714827214341218305	2016-03-29T14:51:03	Actual quote from Debbie Wasserman Schultz - head of the DNC. 
ShaunKing	714826589922574336	2016-03-29T14:48:34	Where the head of the DNC says the current delegate system was designed to SQUASH grassroots activists 
ShaunKing	714826098761207808	2016-03-29T14:46:37	Hillary Clinton currently has 94% of the superdelegates.   That is in NO WAY proportional to the pledged delegates, popular vote, states won
ShaunKing	714825912580186112	2016-03-29T14:45:53	Now, let's be clear, folk can say well these are the rules the candidates agreed upon or even created.   Cool.  I'm saying they suck.
ShaunKing	714825531687051265	2016-03-29T14:44:22	If Sanders had the superdelegate votes that Clinton currently has, he’d be winning this race with 1,444 total delegates to Clinton’s 1,272.
ShaunKing	714825314682187777	2016-03-29T14:43:30	Idaho is among the worst. BernieSanders blew Hillary away. Got 78% of the vote. Landslide.   EVERY SINGLE superdelegate for Clinton.
ShaunKing	714825051649024001	2016-03-29T14:42:27	In Minnesota, BernieSanders won 62% of the vote, but 81% of the superdelegates (governor, senators, congresspeople) are voting Clinton.
ShaunKing	714824807209156608	2016-03-29T14:41:29	In Colorado, BernieSanders won the state w/ 59% of the vote.   Every single superdelegate is still going for Clinton.
ShaunKing	714824629940924421	2016-03-29T14:40:47	For instance, in Washington State, BernieSanders won EVERY single county + nearly 75% of the vote.   85% of superdelegates go to Clinton.
ShaunKing	714824446582906880	2016-03-29T14:40:03	What's WILD is that even in states where Bernie won by a landslide, EVERY superdelegate in those states often still choose Hillary...
ShaunKing	714824221545914370	2016-03-29T14:39:09	So, the race is actually close in terms of earned delegates and in terms of states won.   BernieSanders has also won 5 states in a row.
ShaunKing	714824026984751104	2016-03-29T14:38:23	First, let's be clear on where we stand with actual earned delegates determined by voters.  Hillary = 1,267 Bernie = 1,037
ShaunKing	714823648352317440	2016-03-29T14:36:53	I want to take a few minutes to unpack the superdelegate debacle that is happening right now in the Democratic Party.

ShaunKing	714519524163366912	2016-03-28T18:28:24	lanceburson right. Haha. I get it.
ShaunKing	714518627546849282	2016-03-28T18:24:50	I'm talking ShaunKing on race, justice &amp; the 2016 election followed by tokyovampires on why he created BernieMadeMeWhite ProgressiveArmy
ShaunKing	714519059191173120	2016-03-28T18:26:33	Also, NathanDeal is in his second term. Bottom line is that he did what was right and what was best for Georgia by vetoing HB757
ShaunKing	714518706999656449	2016-03-28T18:25:09	It's easy to say NathanDeal "just vetoed HB757 for the money". He would've been a conservative FOLK HERO had he done it. He said no anyway
ShaunKing	714518157185179648	2016-03-28T18:22:58	tishushu I hear that, but to be clear, his party HATES him for this. They are saying so. He would've been a hero had he signed it.
ShaunKing	714517896110673920	2016-03-28T18:21:56	I don't disagree. The threats from businesses were vital, but PatMcCroryNC said threats be damned &amp; signed it in NC 
ShaunKing	714517459546595328	2016-03-28T18:20:12	AaronChewning NathanDeal absolutely man. He did what was best and what was right.
ShaunKing	714514752765042689	2016-03-28T18:09:26	My friend Mayor KasimReed has worked very closely on many issues w/ NathanDeal. Through that, I've grown to respect the Governor.
ShaunKing	714514512708313088	2016-03-28T18:08:29	And, I actually think NathanDeal sincerely knew the bill was bad for the state where he is governor. He loves Georgia. I know this much.
ShaunKing	714514278720663556	2016-03-28T18:07:33	So yes NathanDeal vetoing HB757 likely had EVERYTHING to do with the financial fallout, but the bottom line is he vetoed it. Others didn't
ShaunKing	714513904655839232	2016-03-28T18:06:04	My hope is that by vetoing HB757  - NathanDeal has given some other conservatives around the country a model for how they should handle it
ShaunKing	714513763010015232	2016-03-28T18:05:30	In essence, NathanDeal today had the sense &amp; courage to do what North Carolina's Governor PatMcCroryNC refused to do. I'm proud of him.
ShaunKing	714513510248669184	2016-03-28T18:04:30	In the end, it took NathanDeal having the guts, the heart, the business savvy, and the COMMON SENSE to VETO HB757.
ShaunKing	714513021352218625	2016-03-28T18:02:33	For sure, Disney &amp; Marvel &amp; AMC_TV &amp; WalkingDead_AMC ALL put MAJOR pressure on NathanDeal to veto this bill. It meant EVERYTHING, but..
ShaunKing	714512827147554817	2016-03-28T18:01:47	I think what NathanDeal (a conservative Republican) just did here in Georgia by vetoing a widely passed anti-LGBT bill was Lincoln-esque.
ShaunKing	714512644850450432	2016-03-28T18:01:04	Ultimately, though, out of political necessity and some genuine courage, President Lincoln actually did push to end slavery.
ShaunKing	714512391971676161	2016-03-28T18:00:03	Students of history will tell you that President Lincoln openly said he would've tried to save the union w/o freeing the slaves if he could
ShaunKing	714512143954087936	2016-03-28T17:59:04	Dear NathanDeal. You showed real guts today by bucking your party and vetoing HB757.   THANK YOU!

ShaunKing	713022282462007296	2016-03-24T15:18:54	To show that this law passed in North Carolina wasn't about RESTROOMS, they also banned cities from EVER increasing the minimum wage.

ShaunKing	713021008274399232	2016-03-24T15:13:50	18. North Carolina attempted to avoid it all, and leapfrogged past other states by presenting and making a law all in one damn day.

ShaunKing	713020359851831296	2016-03-24T15:11:15	15. By attempting to rush it through in one day, North Carolina attempted to avoid the backlash Georgia is currently experiencing.
ShaunKing	713020220655452161	2016-03-24T15:10:42	14. Charlotte's Mayor - JenRobertsNC - a brilliant woman - called this new law the most aggressive "anti-LGBT law in the country."

ShaunKing	713019386240614401	2016-03-24T15:07:23	11. This bill that was presented, voted on, passed, and signed into law in half a day, does more than restrict restrooms. WAY MORE.
ShaunKing	713019244242464769	2016-03-24T15:06:49	10. In one single day, in one fell swoop, The State of North Carolina enacted the most dangerous anti-LGBT law in the United States.
ShaunKing	713019012591009793	2016-03-24T15:05:54	9. Then, PatMcCroryNC - the governor of North Carolina, had THIRTY (30) DAYS to sign the anti-LGBT bill into law.  He took 3 hours.
ShaunKing	713018741915779072	2016-03-24T15:04:49	8. In just 3 hours, without giving the public or even members of the state house or Senate time to debate it, they voted &amp; approved the bill

ShaunKing	713017956914053120	2016-03-24T15:01:42	6. That aspect of the Charlotte ordinance, which is already a law in cities all over the country, became a lightning rod. But get this...
ShaunKing	713017779843162114	2016-03-24T15:01:00	5. For conservatives in North Carolina, they said allowing transgender individuals to choose a restroom would invite sexual predators, etc.
ShaunKing	713017501479776256	2016-03-24T14:59:54	4. Mind you, people of all kinds already share restrooms on airplanes, at some restaurants, libraries, etc. Not revolutionary. However...
ShaunKing	713017278569250816	2016-03-24T14:59:01	3. One part of the Charlotte ordinance was set to allow transgender individuals to attend the restroom of their choice.

ShaunKing	710854388034772992	2016-03-18T15:44:27	6. It is the very political establishment that Bernie is fighting against that is now most passionately calling for him to step down.
ShaunKing	710853917744177152	2016-03-18T15:42:35	5. Super delegates don't formally decide UNTIL the convention. In some states where Bernie won by 25 points, they are still pledging to HRC.
ShaunKing	710853699925622784	2016-03-18T15:41:43	4. Having BernieSanders in this race forces all of the issues to swing to the progressive left. A completely different race without him.
ShaunKing	710853353656426496	2016-03-18T15:40:21	3a. BernieSanders is actually polling VERY WELL in the remaining states. That may be why people are calling him to drop out now.
ShaunKing	710853235565830144	2016-03-18T15:39:53	3. Half of the country - including New York &amp; California - has not yet had a chance to vote. Let's let EVERY single state vote.
ShaunKing	710852941738090496	2016-03-18T15:38:42	2a. The rest of the young people of this country deserve a chance to vote for the nominee that they CLEARLY prefer. Period.
ShaunKing	710852807298064384	2016-03-18T15:38:10	2. Bernie is DOMINATING the youth (under 30) vote by nearly 3-1 (1.6 million to Hillary's 600,000). 
ShaunKing	710852207508377600	2016-03-18T15:35:47	1. BernieSanders could still win the nomination. As long as it is mathematically possible, he should, of course, stay in the race. Period.
ShaunKing	710852035432869888	2016-03-18T15:35:06	At first, I had 5 solid reasons why BernieSanders should stay in this race, but I actually have 7. Here they are...
