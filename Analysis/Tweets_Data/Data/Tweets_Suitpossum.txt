Suitpossum	725305442499497984	2016-04-27T12:47:47	jonmatonis The notion of 'more powerful' is a relative concept. Indeed 'power' often means 'able to command resources &amp; labour of others'

Suitpossum	720964610032058368	2016-04-15T13:18:52	haydentiff And the reason your spidey senses are going off is maybe because I don't fit into your normal binaries of who's good vs bad
Suitpossum	720963897906343936	2016-04-15T13:16:02	haydentiff I like to critique many different forms of oppressors 
Suitpossum	720963371420532736	2016-04-15T13:13:57	haydentiff Ha ha, you are hilarious. The answer is no - I work for myself - but I'm interested in the paranoia that underpins your question
Suitpossum	720960806406483968	2016-04-15T13:03:45	haydentiff And people who don't criticise basically resemble religious missionaries. Critique is the only thing preventing self-delusion
Suitpossum	720960151193313280	2016-04-15T13:01:09	haydentiff I like people who do things, but I cannot stand the insipid entrepreneur-cult ideology that's more a religious belief system

Suitpossum	720959252198748160	2016-04-15T12:57:35	haydentiff I understand your point but I don't do uncritical optimism for the sake of it. I do blends between critique and support
Suitpossum	720953723208515584	2016-04-15T12:35:36	haydentiff There are 54 countries in Africa, each one different. When I go to Bitcoin events it's spoken of as single entity. Fucked up
Suitpossum	720951872408956928	2016-04-15T12:28:15	haydentiff As a person from 'Africa' I'm increasingly intolerant of patronising bullshit about it pumped out by US-based tech evangelists

Suitpossum	704070626789756929	2016-02-28T22:28:13	SkyeElijah That doesn't equate to 'therefore money originally emerged to deal with the problems of barter' though. The barter myth is

Suitpossum	704068847851204608	2016-02-28T22:21:08	SkyeElijah But that's an entirely different claim to arguing that barter comes before the origin of money

Suitpossum	698548919148617728	2016-02-13T16:46:55	ivivekkm haydentiff haq4good Ok, but some very committed people in the blockchain world have praised it e.g. 
Suitpossum	698546365434085376	2016-02-13T16:36:46	haydentiff haq4good Because the reason why things are happening now is that people didn't design the systems properly from the start
Suitpossum	698545894711554048	2016-02-13T16:34:54	haydentiff haq4good Sorry, just playing. Was wondering whether you'd read the paper because I do seem to address some of these things
Suitpossum	698540473720426497	2016-02-13T16:13:21	haydentiff haq4good You seem to be channelling one of the two viewpoints I describe on page 15 of the report. I wonder which one... ;)
Suitpossum	698536321661460484	2016-02-13T15:56:51	haydentiff haq4good The infrastructure of blockchain might be theoretically democratic &amp; transparent but the use of it does not have to be
Suitpossum	698535810329608193	2016-02-13T15:54:50	haydentiff haq4good Thus, if you create unbreakable coded smart contracts, you better have *very* robust system of governance behind them
Suitpossum	698535371643187200	2016-02-13T15:53:05	haydentiff haq4good Hence the reason why liberation movements always break the legally-binding contracts of previous power groups
Suitpossum	698535123101294592	2016-02-13T15:52:06	haydentiff haq4good The most advanced forms of corruption are achieved through legitimate enforceable contracts, not hiding in shadows

Suitpossum	698526568025624576	2016-02-13T15:18:06	Thoughtful and thought-provoking. Addresses taboos in Bitcoin land and Silicon Valley. 
Suitpossum	698491369623547904	2016-02-13T12:58:14	Excellent paper on Bitcoin/Blockchain . Thanks Suitpossum for the savings on reading time .. sth worth paying for :)
Suitpossum	698450474232582146	2016-02-13T10:15:44	NewsoJam fintechna That write-up misrepresented my argument &amp; skewed it for sensationalism. My point was somewhat more nuanced that that

Suitpossum	698117887236698113	2016-02-12T12:14:09	hisalome Hi Salome, here's that paper I was referring to 
Suitpossum	698116335566508036	2016-02-12T12:07:59	haydentiff Sure, you're right. I'll try incorporate it into any other writing I do on this (which is quite sporadic!)
Suitpossum	698114345553784832	2016-02-12T12:00:04	haydentiff Yes I know a lot about LETS/Mutual Credit systems. And yes, I remember when Ryan Fugger first designed it he used that anology
Suitpossum	698106855600582656	2016-02-12T11:30:19	haydentiff But don't get me wrong - I like Ripple. It just didn't jump out at me as the most obvious example for that particular paper
Suitpossum	698105773205884928	2016-02-12T11:26:01	haydentiff Something like Faircoin is a lot less professional that Ripple, but it's interesting from an *alternative vision* perspective
Suitpossum	698105503440891905	2016-02-12T11:24:56	haydentiff That's not necessarily a problem, but if I'm writing a paper on alternative  community finance I'm more interested in grassroots
Suitpossum	698105134258241536	2016-02-12T11:23:28	haydentiff Well Ripple is a payments system, which is cool. In the past it seemed more down-to-earth, but now very much bank-focussed

Suitpossum	697944092379111424	2016-02-12T00:43:33	haydentiff and I'm not sure why I would *deliberately* leave Ripple out. I can't address every blockchain protect in a single paper
Suitpossum	697943479905882112	2016-02-12T00:41:07	haydentiff Faircoin is used as an example of an unambiguous explicitly communitarian vision. It is not intended as an endorsement
