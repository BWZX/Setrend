JWMason1	724755348817596416	2016-04-26T00:21:55	MacRoweNick Fair point. On the other hand, almost none of the technological U stuff he's responding to talks about land either.

JWMason1	723138550997372928	2016-04-21T13:17:20	wbmosler StephanieKelton Agree with this! My q is why/when we reach this conclusion via income flows, and why/when via balance sheets.
JWMason1	723138449478422528	2016-04-21T13:16:56	NathanTankus StephanieKelton There's a place for both. Obviously. But I'm curious why focus has shifted from income to balance sheets.

JWMason1	722129976812834816	2016-04-18T18:29:37	I agree with everything Matt Karp says here: 
JWMason1	722092507312623624	2016-04-18T16:00:44	AuburnParks This is the part we agree on.
JWMason1	722091072084643840	2016-04-18T15:55:02	AuburnParks Dude, there was no Fed during the Civil War.
JWMason1	722090654810120192	2016-04-18T15:53:22	AuburnParks Pure dogmatism. Same as saying God is the son, the father and the Holy Ghost.
JWMason1	722090539441594369	2016-04-18T15:52:55	AuburnParks I invite you to explore bond markets during WWI, civil war. Inflation spiked, yields hardly moved at all.
JWMason1	722090200130850817	2016-04-18T15:51:34	AuburnParks You might, if you could fund it at 1%, and/or risk-adjusted return on alternatives less. History full of negative real yields.
JWMason1	722089797070819328	2016-04-18T15:49:58	AuburnParks But CPI only matters if you are holding bonds to fund future purchases of consumption goods.
JWMason1	722089401786974208	2016-04-18T15:48:23	AuburnParks There's actually quite a lot of historical evidence on this. In absence of policy response no relationship btw inflation and i.
JWMason1	722089064221057025	2016-04-18T15:47:03	AuburnParks Inflation is important in real world bc affects future policy. In your hypothetical of ZIRP forever, it wouldn't be.
JWMason1	722088576595468289	2016-04-18T15:45:07	AuburnParks Your call. But I think the idea that the representative holder of Treasury is household saving for own retirement is naive.
JWMason1	722088134096371716	2016-04-18T15:43:21	AuburnParks Right, they are very liquid. Hence low yield.
JWMason1	722087559950635008	2016-04-18T15:41:04	AuburnParks No. Interest traded off against funding costs, risk, return on alternatives. Inflation doesn't come into it.
JWMason1	722084756205211648	2016-04-18T15:29:56	AuburnParks I don't agree. CPI plays no role in this scenario. No one holds bonds to fund future consumption.
JWMason1	722084644590641152	2016-04-18T15:29:29	AuburnParks Bondholders worry not only about default risk but ease/price with which binds can be converted to cash.
JWMason1	722078073584238593	2016-04-18T15:03:22	plbds Salon Yes exactly. And more so with shift from physical commodities to IP.
JWMason1	722077788329615360	2016-04-18T15:02:14	AuburnParks I'm not sure inflation plays any independent role tho. And default risk secondary. Liquidity more important.
JWMason1	722077605478985728	2016-04-18T15:01:31	AuburnParks I agree. That's why I called idea that markets set rates "fiction". :-)
JWMason1	722074897355177984	2016-04-18T14:50:45	AuburnParks We are talking about Europe here but yes the fiction that interest rates are set by "the markets" dies hard.

JWMason1	721695029329326081	2016-04-17T13:41:18	mcorliss TheStalwart That's right. What it is is an argument for accepting risk of larger increase, conditional on supporting a small one.

JWMason1	721020609430482949	2016-04-15T17:01:23	JHWeissmann What are "those issues" exactly? Focusing on that one specific paper is distraction. Other examples?
JWMason1	721020330119180289	2016-04-15T17:00:17	JHWeissmann haroldpollack Some good ideas there but doesn't look like a plan for universal coverage.
JWMason1	721020026900324353	2016-04-15T16:59:04	Noahpinion TheStalwart Did you read it that way? Didn't intend that.
JWMason1	721019411042332672	2016-04-15T16:56:38	JHWeissmann Look I agree with you that Jerry's paper is not really defensible. I say so clearly in interview! But I think it's distraction.
JWMason1	721019055134650368	2016-04-15T16:55:13	TheStalwart Noahpinion I don't have recording, can't check exact words. But I don't see anything I wouldn't say. What seems off to you?
JWMason1	721018577395036164	2016-04-15T16:53:19	JHWeissmann Personally I worry more abt magical thinking of "incremental" move to universal healthcare, childcare etc w/ no concrete steps.
JWMason1	721018177522675712	2016-04-15T16:51:44	JHWeissmann Your linked piece does not discuss any problems with Sanders campaign numbers.
JWMason1	721017859703508992	2016-04-15T16:50:28	JHWeissmann I don't agree that there is consensus on a need for more expansionary policy. If shifting that way, Friedman gets some credit.
JWMason1	721017410594201600	2016-04-15T16:48:41	JHWeissmann I really think the problems with Jerry Friedman's numbers, while real, are a very minor issue here.
JWMason1	721016786137784320	2016-04-15T16:46:12	JHWeissmann How so?
JWMason1	721015545521430529	2016-04-15T16:41:16	This was a good interview. 
JWMason1	721013875940921345	2016-04-15T16:34:38	mbastiani100 I don't make recommendations about personal finance at all.
JWMason1	720837308316913665	2016-04-15T04:53:01	Except, it seems, when it's a campaign donation. 
JWMason1	720656816892481538	2016-04-14T16:55:48	franglophonic Yeah I know these rules pretty well actually.
JWMason1	720626799005327360	2016-04-14T14:56:32	This is an important point.  
JWMason1	720625895241879552	2016-04-14T14:52:56	rortybomb JHWeissmann jeffspross matt_levine There's interesting, productive tension here. I take easy way out, see truth in both sides.
JWMason1	720615852261928960	2016-04-14T14:13:02	salimfurth dylanmatt JHWeissmann Which is sometimes fine, sometimes not. Also need to operationalize "large".
JWMason1	720615550079123457	2016-04-14T14:11:50	salimfurth dylanmatt JHWeissmann No one would call a business insolvent (Grant's term) by debt only without looking at expected earnings.
JWMason1	720615046422872064	2016-04-14T14:09:50	salimfurth dylanmatt JHWeissmann Yes. But that is the actual fact of the matter. The burden of the debt depends strongly on future g &amp; i.
JWMason1	720614927552094208	2016-04-14T14:09:21	salimfurth dylanmatt JHWeissmann Well, I'm not sure what the actual informational content is.
JWMason1	720614746152706048	2016-04-14T14:08:38	VulgarEconomics Is it? Petty has stress on first syllable, French doesn't really use stresses.
JWMason1	720614484889481216	2016-04-14T14:07:36	salimfurth dylanmatt JHWeissmann Or divide debt by present value of future per capita GDP, that would also capture burden, right?
JWMason1	720614172615184384	2016-04-14T14:06:21	salimfurth dylanmatt JHWeissmann Yes meaningful number will require assumptions. I don't think that's good reason to use meaningless one.
JWMason1	720613660683603968	2016-04-14T14:04:19	VulgarEconomics logically I see your point. But petty has a better mouthfeel.
JWMason1	720613429858471936	2016-04-14T14:03:24	salimfurth dylanmatt JHWeissmann Conceptually right measure would be pv of per capita tax to get debt-GDP ratio to long run value, right?
JWMason1	720612430808813568	2016-04-14T13:59:26	VulgarEconomics Yeah, petit or petty. I can't decide. What do you think?
JWMason1	720603793860259840	2016-04-14T13:25:07	salimfurth Do you really think this kind of story improves people's understanding of federal budget or fiscal policy?
JWMason1	720603381153271808	2016-04-14T13:23:28	arindube This is not a good argument.

JWMason1	720441679401103361	2016-04-14T02:40:56	arindube Disagree. 1st, I think "petty bourgeois" has distinct content. 2nd, that Trump supporters "working class" not supported by data.

JWMason1	720433402139254784	2016-04-14T02:08:02	I feel like discussion of Trump's supporters really suffers from the disappearance of the category "petty bourgeois."

JWMason1	720267181393510401	2016-04-13T15:07:32	MerijnKnibbe Agree. But should US be using its weight in world trade to dictate policy to other countries even for attractive ends?

JWMason1	720235084981407745	2016-04-13T13:00:00	rsjanabasis Agree with everything except this. Real trade can also limit collective choice via govt policy.

JWMason1	719860144448872448	2016-04-12T12:10:07	Here is a new post with some links, and comments on them. 
JWMason1	719627799829618688	2016-04-11T20:46:52	stf18 It's a good piece. I've learned a lot from your stuff! But new, important thing in delong's piece is decline of commodity form.
JWMason1	719624324618067969	2016-04-11T20:33:03	IanSeda delong is saying that the commodity form becomes a fetter on the forces of production. Not those exact words, but that exact idea.
JWMason1	719615717549719553	2016-04-11T19:58:51	JWMason1 pretty much what I said in 2006 fyi 
JWMason1	719622619021053953	2016-04-11T20:26:16	IanSeda delong Production increasingly directly social, no longer fits with commodity form.
JWMason1	719622303617847297	2016-04-11T20:25:01	repagent1 How do you know they can't?
JWMason1	719596758536429570	2016-04-11T18:43:31	repagent1 Hopefully we'll still have central banks around.
JWMason1	719595959651594240	2016-04-11T18:40:20	Over next 50 years 1) public sectors shd get bigger 2) public debt shd get bigger 3) high debt ratios aren't costly. 
JWMason1	719591874911199234	2016-04-11T18:24:07	On p. 4-6 delong gets closer to Marx's view on why capitalism must end, than anything on falling profit rates, etc. 
JWMason1	719591451731095552	2016-04-11T18:22:26	This from delong is very, very smart. Maybe the best thing I've read on future of public debt. 
JWMason1	719588126201638912	2016-04-11T18:09:13	. JosephEStiglitz put it well: No such thing as non-manipulated exchange rate. Question is just whether their central bank sets it, or Fed.
JWMason1	719552148225269760	2016-04-11T15:46:15	shishiqiushi Helping US workers is not a good goal for trade policy. Many, many better ways to achieve that end.
JWMason1	719550940584525825	2016-04-11T15:41:27	This is not really a program for US tho. Goal would be to give other countries the policy space US already has.
JWMason1	719550654969180160	2016-04-11T15:40:19	One program for trade wd be less integration -&gt; more space for alternative policies at national level. Keynes' view. 
JWMason1	719549932731047937	2016-04-11T15:37:27	shishiqiushi I think the left is divided on this issue even more than on most others. There is a useful debate to be had. But yes, I agree.
JWMason1	719548229684236288	2016-04-11T15:30:41	shishiqiushi But if we do have rules, they should be explicit. Not vague categories like "manipulation." (Or "dumping" for that matter.)
JWMason1	719547995675586560	2016-04-11T15:29:45	shishiqiushi I think "countries can do whatever they want" would be a step forward actually.

JWMason1	719545203514871809	2016-04-11T15:18:39	Anyway net effect of Chinese outward K controls + BoC $ purchases is almost certainly to *strengthen* RMB relative to no-intervention case.
JWMason1	719544816682577920	2016-04-11T15:17:07	All kinds of policies affect exrates. Not controversial to say low US interest rates weaken dollar, help US exports. Why not "manipulation"?
JWMason1	719544311860367360	2016-04-11T15:15:07	Useful roundup from jimtankersley on trade myths. But I wish he didn't buy myth that China "manipulates" currecny.

JWMason1	719233880138625028	2016-04-10T18:41:34	interfluidity Robotbeat Noahpinion I think one big (main?) source of problem is starting with very general models of economy as whole.
JWMason1	719233124996104193	2016-04-10T18:38:34	interfluidity Noahpinion I don't think criticizing current practice requires agreement on what "models are for."
JWMason1	719228152476778496	2016-04-10T18:18:48	Noahpinion Heterodox macro has wider selection of models to use in place of DSGE but basic approach is the same, unfortunately.

JWMason1	718789496586772480	2016-04-09T13:15:45	JoMicheII Noahpinion Again, this *could* be true. Something else to say that it is the main factor driving demand.
JWMason1	718787682718101505	2016-04-09T13:08:32	Instead of paulkrugman's current column, let's read this instead: 
JWMason1	718786766917013504	2016-04-09T13:04:54	Noahpinion Sure there are plausible ways higher inequality could contribute to slower growth. But plausible stories going other way too.

JWMason1	718595851204083714	2016-04-09T00:26:16	Sounds familiar! From a wonderful essay by BarkerTV that's actually about Merle Haggard.  
JWMason1	718561705287139328	2016-04-08T22:10:35	Agree with Arin. There's a liberal theodicy that makes conditions of steady growth whatever we approve of morally.

JWMason1	718516793002889216	2016-04-08T19:12:07	rsjanabasis I really don't think twitter is informative about politics at all.
JWMason1	718516456665849860	2016-04-08T19:10:47	It takes someone very special to think that a $150 billion merger is like "peasants’ money hidden in haystacks." 
JWMason1	718501262082355200	2016-04-08T18:10:24	Agree with mattyglesias - there's no political significance to what's said on Twitter (&amp; social media in general.) 
JWMason1	718408472153473024	2016-04-08T12:01:41	When I used to play Go I thought of the game exactly like this.  
JWMason1	718164929635815425	2016-04-07T19:53:56	mattyglesias Econ_Marshall That's right. In this case there was also "this is an interesting problem" and "trade policy is important."

JWMason1	718119177660338177	2016-04-07T16:52:08	MattBruenig yeselson SethAckerman DavidKaib Yes. If heathcare reform was urgently needed in 2008, then it's still urgently needed today.
JWMason1	718113579195613188	2016-04-07T16:29:53	salimfurth rortybomb OK, sorry. Easy to get confused in this medium Anyway I think we agree on the main points.
JWMason1	718112762178744320	2016-04-07T16:26:39	salimfurth rortybomb I'm not making any predictions about exchange rate.
JWMason1	718112545941356545	2016-04-07T16:25:47	salimfurth rortybomb But I *don't* think that. That's the point. I'm saying that if you believed Zandi's numbers you would think that.
JWMason1	718108324840022016	2016-04-07T16:09:01	salimfurth rortybomb That's right. And I think price elasticities based on exrate changes gives us solid basis for saying how much.
JWMason1	718106580567375872	2016-04-07T16:02:05	salimfurth rortybomb one step at a time dude! First we ask about effects on trade flows. Then go from that to GDP.
JWMason1	718106436446892033	2016-04-07T16:01:30	salimfurth rortybomb ... the change in each of those trade flows separately.
JWMason1	718106128794697728	2016-04-07T16:00:17	salimfurth rortybomb Depreciation makes imports more expensive here (tariff) &amp; exports more expensive abroad (subsidy). We can observe ...
JWMason1	718105857750380546	2016-04-07T15:59:12	salimfurth rortybomb We can observe import prices and export prices.
JWMason1	718105162900979713	2016-04-07T15:56:27	salimfurth rortybomb Yes. Which we can observe separately. :-)
JWMason1	718105043484983296	2016-04-07T15:55:58	salimfurth rortybomb No, it really isn't.
JWMason1	718104950002331648	2016-04-07T15:55:36	salimfurth rortybomb Yes. That's why I said that depreciation is the same as increase in tariff + export subsidy. :-)
JWMason1	718103139317112832	2016-04-07T15:48:24	salimfurth rortybomb ... on oil price movements, even tho the gas tax is not identical to a rise in oil prices.
JWMason1	718103029862506496	2016-04-07T15:47:58	salimfurth rortybomb If someone says a 50-cent a gallon tax on gas will reduce GDP by 5%, I can reject that on basis of historical data...
JWMason1	718102468207501312	2016-04-07T15:45:44	salimfurth rortybomb It's not an exact analogy in either case. But it is informative about the plausible scale of effects.
JWMason1	718099621206163460	2016-04-07T15:34:25	salimfurth rortybomb It doesn't matter what's causing them. The point is, they affect relative prices just like a tariff would.
JWMason1	718099394374053888	2016-04-07T15:33:31	salimfurth rortybomb OK. Why is this important?
JWMason1	718099265025916928	2016-04-07T15:33:01	salimfurth rortybomb Sure. But I wouldn't be very confident about estimating effects today based on data from 150 years ago.
JWMason1	718099073077743616	2016-04-07T15:32:15	salimfurth rortybomb But we don't have a lot of data, because there aren't a lot of big tariffs around to study. Lots of exrate data.
JWMason1	718098088724922368	2016-04-07T15:28:20	salimfurth rortybomb Yes, sorry I wasn't clear.

JWMason1	718085348920803328	2016-04-07T14:37:43	salimfurth rortybomb I don't agree.  Depreciation = tariff plus export subsidy.

JWMason1	717772772336865280	2016-04-06T17:55:39	salimfurth rortybomb US doesn't export much to China. And again, we can quantify "a lot." It's not a lot.
JWMason1	717772591696457728	2016-04-06T17:54:56	salimfurth rortybomb Ok but we have the actual record of floating exrates to look at. If rel price changes this disruptive, we'd know.
JWMason1	717733715603009536	2016-04-06T15:20:27	repagent1 rortybomb That's a reasonable argument. But def won't get Zandi's results that way - with high elasts prob expansionary on net.
JWMason1	717733056128356352	2016-04-06T15:17:50	repagent1 rortybomb Exactly.

JWMason1	716007599196487681	2016-04-01T21:01:29	DanMKervick Ramanan_V asymptosis I don't agree. Economists need to help us get out of fly bottle of "production" and enjoy life.

JWMason1	716000911190003712	2016-04-01T20:34:54	AndyBarenberg josephtrebello Yup! Also all good ideas if min wage does not increase. So why bring up black men now?
JWMason1	715976970954280961	2016-04-01T18:59:46	AndyBarenberg josephtrebello So maybe $15 for whites, $12 for blacks would be better? Or $15 for all but ban blacks from joining unions?

JWMason1	714884107776475136	2016-03-29T18:37:07	Dave_Attewell jacobfhsmith Problem here is that people are explicitly proposing median wage standard. If you want to use col, use col.

JWMason1	714281627745128448	2016-03-28T02:43:05	arindube rortybomb ModeledBehavior Thanks! This is helpful. So why do you prefer median wage to RPP?
JWMason1	714280287648280576	2016-03-28T02:37:45	samh510 ... north but mainly South wd have had to focus on easing productivity not just keeping wages low. And natl politics better.
JWMason1	714280050070257664	2016-03-28T02:36:49	samh510 Ok but it's about the jobs not people. In counterfactual where wage arbitrage blocked, some more Southerners might have moved...
JWMason1	714279702412861442	2016-03-28T02:35:26	arindube rortybomb On reflection tho not sure it matters. 1% increase in money income -&gt; 1% more consumption regardless of cost of living.
JWMason1	714279428214407168	2016-03-28T02:34:21	arindube rortybomb So what's the best data on cost of living across geographies? Is it closely correlated with median wage?
JWMason1	714279318009094144	2016-03-28T02:33:54	arindube rortybomb Oh I see hat you mean now. Hm. Hadn't thought of that.
JWMason1	714278821248237569	2016-03-28T02:31:56	arindube rortybomb If goal is to raise labor income then that's irrelevant.
JWMason1	714278658828009472	2016-03-28T02:31:17	arindube ModeledBehavior Say more?
JWMason1	714278447397339136	2016-03-28T02:30:27	US labor mvmt &amp; politics wd be in much better shape today if North-South wage arbitrage had been closed off by policy.
JWMason1	714278127065776128	2016-03-28T02:29:10	Also in some cases we want uniform min even if job losses large. Uniform min in 1950s-1970s wd have kept industry from moving south.
JWMason1	714277911373725696	2016-03-28T02:28:19	rortybomb arindube Right. Sig. job loss -&gt; min shd be lower where wages lower. No sig. job loss -&gt; min shd be higher where wages low.
JWMason1	714277400398471169	2016-03-28T02:26:17	arindube ModeledBehavior If CA min means 1% job loss in San Bernardino &amp; 0.5% in San Jose, gains greater in former, shd go up more there.
JWMason1	714276583146713088	2016-03-28T02:23:02	arindube ModeledBehavior you didn't answer. Your position requires you to affirmatively predict absolutely large losses. Do you?

JWMason1	714275646059515904	2016-03-28T02:19:19	ModeledBehavior arindube Then why won't he say so?
JWMason1	714275570650062848	2016-03-28T02:19:01	arindube Most of my preferences differ from most voters. No reason to debate policy on if they didn't.
JWMason1	714275319688118272	2016-03-28T02:18:01	arindube That would be a step forward from median wage.
JWMason1	714275205422702592	2016-03-28T02:17:34	arindube rortybomb Should we be trying to level wages globally at all?
JWMason1	714275123830923264	2016-03-28T02:17:14	samh510 arindube And race, gender, education, occupation don't?
JWMason1	714275038682345472	2016-03-28T02:16:54	arindube I support same minimum wage for men and women, but not because I am misandrist.
JWMason1	714274719198011392	2016-03-28T02:15:38	fl0pson arindube Right! That's why I'm saying Arin's position requires him to affirmatively predict major job loss in low wage areas of CA
JWMason1	714273758928834560	2016-03-28T02:11:49	arindube I don't have a preference. I have an analysis. :-)
JWMason1	714273636396494848	2016-03-28T02:11:20	arindube If goal is to raise incomes at bottom, whether we want higher/lower min in low wage areas depends on where we are rel to optimum.
JWMason1	714273233349029888	2016-03-28T02:09:44	arindube Gain=% income increase x (1 - %jobs lost ). 1st term biggest where wages low; if last term small, gain greatest in low wage areas.
JWMason1	714272224426008576	2016-03-28T02:05:43	arindube Maybe but I'm not sure why it matters? Wouldn't support lower min wage for childless people even tho their cost of living lower.
JWMason1	714271731905597440	2016-03-28T02:03:46	arindube Analogy: Where are workplace safety rules most needed, safe jobs or dangerous ones?
JWMason1	714271592268881920	2016-03-28T02:03:12	arindube And: if job losses in fact small, then income gains from given min wage highest where wages are currently low.
JWMason1	714271375893069824	2016-03-28T02:02:21	arindube But there are also labor markets by industry, occupation, worker characteristics. Why is geography special?
JWMason1	714270868411662336	2016-03-28T02:00:20	arindube Presumably the goal of min wage is to flatten out the wage distribution. So it has to bind more in low-wage subpopulations.
JWMason1	714270072265637889	2016-03-28T01:57:10	arindube In general the effects of min wage will be greatest for subsets of workers with lower average income.
JWMason1	714269866883211264	2016-03-28T01:56:21	arindube Sure. And banning exposure to asbestos affects construction workers a lot more than professors. So?
JWMason1	714269399000215552	2016-03-28T01:54:29	arindube We shd discuss off Twitter but this seems bizarre to me. Only reason to have a minimum is to disproportionately raise low wages.
JWMason1	714267914778619906	2016-03-28T01:48:35	View min wage shd be raised less where wages low logically requires significant job losses. If won't predict latter, shdn't claim former.
JWMason1	714267262191067136	2016-03-28T01:46:00	arindube Then why do you support min tied to median? If job losses small, min wage gains greatest where wages are low.
JWMason1	714256151408414720	2016-03-28T01:01:51	Curious if arindube predicts CA's $15 min wage will lead to substantial job loss in poorer areas of state.

JWMason1	713903012792692736	2016-03-27T01:38:36	rsjanabasis I'm not sure either. Other factors, like capital flight, point in same direction.
JWMason1	713901536317976576	2016-03-27T01:32:44	rsjanabasis I agree that is one important part of the picture.
JWMason1	713901421498920960	2016-03-27T01:32:17	rsjanabasis Yes definitely. The chance your country with suffer catastrophic balance of payments crisis affects your welfare!
JWMason1	713901297691439104	2016-03-27T01:31:47	rsjanabasis yes. AND central banks and other actors want holdings of liquid reserve currency assets = to fraction of imports or etc.
JWMason1	713899481343909888	2016-03-27T01:24:34	rsjanabasis well that's the question. We normally think of eg reserves as a desired quantity of liquid assets in a given currency.
JWMason1	713880646293307393	2016-03-27T00:09:43	rsjanabasis Generically that desired holdings of country A's liabilities might differ from amount resulting from trade, investment flows.
JWMason1	713878281465020416	2016-03-27T00:00:20	After decades of c.a. deficits US net investment income strongly positive (1% of GDP) and getting more so over time. 
JWMason1	713862959668310018	2016-03-26T22:59:27	rsjanabasis After some though I want to keep "divine coincidence" in sense that coordination failures are possible here.
JWMason1	713862358687432704	2016-03-26T22:57:03	NeilLancastle Ramanan_V JoMicheII Agree with ericlonners strong case to trust income flows. Maybe bank better analogy than Buffet tho?
JWMason1	713861367380504576	2016-03-26T22:53:07	ericlonners NeilLancastle Ramanan_V JoMicheII Official IIP and income flows telling v different stories. Which do we believe?
JWMason1	713859852741816321	2016-03-26T22:47:06	ericlonners NeilLancastle Ramanan_V JoMicheII Must we resolve this? Could "US is net creditor" &amp; "US gets higher returns" be equivalent?
JWMason1	713859559278903296	2016-03-26T22:45:56	ericlonners NeilLancastle Ramanan_V JoMicheII Intersting. I also like Gourinches &amp; Rey.
JWMason1	713858604286218241	2016-03-26T22:42:08	ericlonners Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII But are we sure flows observed more reliably? Reinvested profits of foreign subsidiaries?
JWMason1	713547584330199041	2016-03-26T02:06:15	If the standard is "access to healthcare for most US citizens" was true already before Obama. If for all, still not.

JWMason1	713496132400320514	2016-03-25T22:41:48	rsjanabasis Hadn't thought of it that way before. Not sure I agree but ... hm.
JWMason1	713487637768773632	2016-03-25T22:08:03	rsjanabasis I think that's what I was saying. No?
JWMason1	713466370705461249	2016-03-25T20:43:32	ericlonners Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII Yes. And it's perfectly possible to sell (or buy) insurance forever.
JWMason1	713428614226845696	2016-03-25T18:13:31	Econ_Marshall paulkrugman Right. But if it is easier for US to borrow in our own currency than for most countries, isn't that a benefit?
JWMason1	713428408412344320	2016-03-25T18:12:42	Econ_Marshall Sure. And then tell countries from which calpital flew, here's your money. Keynes proposed this I believe.
JWMason1	713427866692820992	2016-03-25T18:10:32	Econ_Marshall That's right. But given that we do, in fact, have the trust of the world's plutocrats, what should we do with it?
JWMason1	713427670613286917	2016-03-25T18:09:46	Econ_Marshall paulkrugman Evidently I don't agree. Weird thing is PK's stuff on currency crises shows benefits clearly. Don't get the guy.

JWMason1	713423294276505600	2016-03-25T17:52:22	NathanTankus That's right
JWMason1	713423114827337728	2016-03-25T17:51:39	Ramanan_V Any *given* balance. Yes if primary deficits rise without limit so will ratio. But that's not what people mean by exploding path.
JWMason1	713422718721503232	2016-03-25T17:50:05	Ramanan_V Other nations are different! that's my point. We shd let our NIIP adjust (which we can) so they don't have to (since they can't).
JWMason1	713422511808098305	2016-03-25T17:49:16	Ramanan_V No this one I am sure about. When i &lt; g, *any* primary balance converges to finite debt/GDP ratio.
JWMason1	713418542293655553	2016-03-25T17:33:29	JoMicheII Ramanan_V Huh, you're right. I was recalling from a few years ago. Still don't think it constrains US policy in any way.
JWMason1	713417326050353152	2016-03-25T17:28:39	Ramanan_V teasri ELA is not a swap line. ELA goes to private banks. Swap line is between cbs.
JWMason1	713417042536349697	2016-03-25T17:27:32	"X can't go on forever" does not imply "X must end" within any relevant timeframe.
JWMason1	713416636003401728	2016-03-25T17:25:55	Ramanan_V Also, did the last 35 years not happen?
JWMason1	713416494294691841	2016-03-25T17:25:21	NeilLancastle Joaogalamba Also, as long as world runs on dollar standard, deficits actually are a public good. But could be used better.
JWMason1	713416301746778112	2016-03-25T17:24:35	Ramanan_V "Exploding path" for debt/gdp assumes facts not in evidence, namely i &gt; g.
JWMason1	713416126869422080	2016-03-25T17:23:53	Ramanan_V Fun fact: US NIIP isn't even declining! Higher return on US foreign assets vs foreign assets here basically offsets CA deficit.
JWMason1	713415952482873344	2016-03-25T17:23:12	Ramanan_V I think arguments of the form "in principle X cannot rise without limit, so X will hit a limit soon enough to matter" are flawed.

JWMason1	710214765814136832	2016-03-16T21:22:49	Noahpinion Right - if wage differences reflect inherent productivity diffs, case for regional mins. But no min at all even better then.

JWMason1	710128285146079232	2016-03-16T15:39:11	ticketdust I don't think so. More of a reductio. Point is that low wages mean both potential costs *and* benefits of high min wage greater.
JWMason1	710127726645145600	2016-03-16T15:36:58	ticketdust Suppose region A has high cost of living, high wages. B also has high c.o.l. but low wages. Which needs higher min wage more?
JWMason1	710127431173197825	2016-03-16T15:35:47	MacRoweNick Right. Presumably want to flatten wage distribution as end in itself, not just raise low incomes. Otherwise better ways.
JWMason1	710126996752375808	2016-03-16T15:34:04	MacRoweNick But this suggests lower min for *any* subgroup with lower average wages today, no? Yet nobody says this (except for teens).
JWMason1	710126413534380032	2016-03-16T15:31:45	ticketdust Long history in US of biz relocating to south for lower wages. Shd policy try to prevent that, or not?
JWMason1	710126266255609856	2016-03-16T15:31:10	ticketdust The whole point of min wage is to close wage gaps. So it has to bite harder on low wage jobs to mean anything.
JWMason1	710126148747976704	2016-03-16T15:30:42	ticketdust I know that. But seems like argument against having min wage at all. Shd it also be lower for retail, for teens, for non-whites?

JWMason1	710119501896015872	2016-03-16T15:04:17	Never understood idea of lower min wage in lower-wage areas. Should it also be lower for low-wage industries, demos?

JWMason1	704349290316079104	2016-02-29T16:55:31	Here I am on michalrozworski 's podcast, talking about why we should want more public spending to boost demand.  
JWMason1	703614810441834496	2016-02-27T16:16:57	ticketdust TheStalwart calculatedrisk Yes deserves response. Will write one in next couple days.
JWMason1	703614458057379840	2016-02-27T16:15:33	Prezntval TheStalwart And lets be careful on implications. Explained statistically by demogs doesn't mean fixed or independent of demand.
JWMason1	703613875133009920	2016-02-27T16:13:15	Prezntval TheStalwart Will respond in a day or two. Prob w his approach is depends strongly on period over which you measure trend.
JWMason1	703600945536606208	2016-02-27T15:21:52	Econ_Marshall arindube ryanlcooper rortybomb delong Or how about postWWII Europe? Certainly looks like strong demand pulling up supply.
JWMason1	703600678749523970	2016-02-27T15:20:48	Econ_Marshall arindube ryanlcooper rortybomb delong Do we think Depression/WWII experience relevant or no?
JWMason1	703600069052928000	2016-02-27T15:18:23	arindube Econ_Marshall ryanlcooper rortybomb delong I find this much more plausible prior fwiw (very little).

JWMason1	703599712365125632	2016-02-27T15:16:58	arindube Econ_Marshall ryanlcooper rortybomb delong We cd think of 2 multipliers, big one-time and small persistent. I'm unsure abt it.
JWMason1	703599255806726144	2016-02-27T15:15:09	arindube Econ_Marshall ryanlcooper rortybomb delong Is disequil best way to think abt it? Or just say demand has persistent effects?

JWMason1	702925758549852160	2016-02-25T18:38:55	Saying that lower output in 2009-2011 means permanently lower productivity is  strong endorsement of Verdoorn's law. 
JWMason1	702919197416939520	2016-02-25T18:12:50	Returning to trend doesn't mean producing stuff we didn't produce in 2009 etc. Just means producing as much *this year* as we'd expected.
JWMason1	702866250041597952	2016-02-25T14:42:27	Meant to say this on TheStalwart yesterday -- there's $2 tril in lost output waiting for someone to pick it up. 
JWMason1	702582331958284288	2016-02-24T19:54:15	How to raise potential employment/output?  Data suggests that policies designed to raise labor's share will help. 
JWMason1	702663957618827264	2016-02-25T01:18:37	NathanJRobinson No idea. I never thought Trump had a chance at nomination. Will stick to questions where I have a semi-informed opinion.
JWMason1	702663407942692869	2016-02-25T01:16:25	ArtPatten1 yup
JWMason1	702659622361042944	2016-02-25T01:01:23	JWMason1 great interview, but who did your tie? ;) and at least don't make it worse by pulling on it. We need ppl like u presentable! Ty.
JWMason1	702649329572585473	2016-02-25T00:20:29	Here's my interview with JWMason1 on whether Sanders' Econ plans are realistic 
JWMason1	702662441830895616	2016-02-25T01:12:35	teasri TheStalwart thanks!
JWMason1	702662218270306304	2016-02-25T01:11:42	pio_trek_g haha. I wasn't going to wear one and then put it on literally 5 min before airtime.
JWMason1	702605599306027009	2016-02-24T21:26:43	I think that was a fairly successful intervention.
JWMason1	702562926255849472	2016-02-24T18:37:09	Kocherlakota: Even 5% growth might not mean high inflation -- wage gains could come out of profits. 
JWMason1	702552872148455424	2016-02-24T17:57:12	Just to be clear, Noahpinion definitely isn't dodging the debate with JWMason1. Just couldn't get the scheduling right!
JWMason1	702490462310047744	2016-02-24T13:49:12	teasri kdrum Agree.
JWMason1	702490271506944000	2016-02-24T13:48:27	Thoma: Thinking capacity limited when there's room to grow is much worse than trying and finding gap is too small. 
JWMason1	702484964667949058	2016-02-24T13:27:21	MerijnKnibbe Also 5) higher US trade deficit, closing demand shortfall elsewhere, which is good assuming FE here.
JWMason1	702484288097234944	2016-02-24T13:24:40	I somehow missed this, but good lord the ruling class really isn’t smart.  
JWMason1	702484378526552066	2016-02-24T13:25:02	Martin Wolf: "World economy is slowing durably... behind this is simple reality: ... chronic demand deficiency." 
JWMason1	702460743564857344	2016-02-24T11:51:07	MerijnKnibbe Maybe. But then, extra stimulus 1) raises inflation 2) raises wages 3) gets us off ZLB 4) insures vs new downturn. So why not?
JWMason1	702349976366612481	2016-02-24T04:30:58	teasri kdrum Yes. But we should be fair -- decline in working-age population will be steeper over next 8 years.
JWMason1	702345141697323008	2016-02-24T04:11:45	.kdrum asks what history says on relation of productivity and demand. () 1930s is relevant. 
JWMason1	702190348261576706	2016-02-23T17:56:39	pilkingtonphil Noahpinion TheStalwart Yes I found similar. But- while aging has small role in epop fall to date, gets bigger next decade.
JWMason1	702183547298299906	2016-02-23T17:29:38	MattBruenig ckilpatrick How would we write novels about elite campuses without it?
JWMason1	702179799729569792	2016-02-23T17:14:44	So demographics explains about 1/3 of slowdown in projected growth relative to pre-recession trend. A lot, a little? I report, you decide.
JWMason1	702179609295638529	2016-02-23T17:13:59	Lower projected growth vs pre-2006 50% falling LFP, 50% slower growth in output per worker. Falling LFP about 2/3 demographics, 1/3 not.
JWMason1	702175686123986946	2016-02-23T16:58:24	It seems Noahpinion and I will be debating Sanders-growth question on What'd You Miss with TheStalwart tomorrow.
JWMason1	701908569852145664	2016-02-22T23:16:58	Noahpinion oh sorry I misunderstood.
JWMason1	701893778936832000	2016-02-22T22:18:12	I've been saying this for a while.      etc 
JWMason1	701892379893223424	2016-02-22T22:12:38	TeaCrimes OK. Then yes, that is what I think.
JWMason1	701882581021761538	2016-02-22T21:33:42	TeaCrimes Sorry which CBO number do you mean specifically?
JWMason1	701813417804484609	2016-02-22T16:58:52	Yes. Even if you don't think 5% growth possible, need for higher inflation argues for Sanders-scale stimulus.  
JWMason1	701812877351641089	2016-02-22T16:56:43	Arguably a big problem for Friedman numbers. On other hand, LFPs rose a lot *within* demo groups before 2000, why couldn't they rise more?
JWMason1	701812178110824448	2016-02-22T16:53:56	Given 2000 LFPs by age/sex, demographics predicts 4% fall by today, 8% fall by 2024. So ~1/3 of deviation from pre-GR trend now, ~2/3 then.
JWMason1	701767906904961024	2016-02-22T13:58:01	Ramanan_V Sure, but that's the easy part. My point is that in Depression productivity *also* affected by demand, which is more surprising.
JWMason1	701767698758430721	2016-02-22T13:57:12	jeffspross ryanlcooper delong Cuts other way I think. If weak demand has permanent effects on lfp, productivity, why not strong as well?
JWMason1	701763200690298881	2016-02-22T13:39:19	mattyglesias tbh, an answerphone message that said "solve your own problems" would be in the top quintile of US foreign policy strategies
JWMason1	701766146584870912	2016-02-22T13:51:02	Labor productivity, 1929-1939. 
JWMason1	701756394467360774	2016-02-22T13:12:17	JWMason1 Where x = enough to stay above ZLB in future recessions. If rates too low currently, "fed won't allow it" is feature not bug.
JWMason1	701756241882832896	2016-02-22T13:11:40	Another angle on demand effects of Bernie plan: How much add'l stimulus needed to raise full-employment interest rates by x points?

JWMason1	701477505811750913	2016-02-21T18:44:04	Econ_Marshall jeffspross ryanlcooper gfriedma M_C_Klein How much of historical e/p cd have been predicted ex ante by demographics?

JWMason1	701463861203828737	2016-02-21T17:49:51	Useful context :  If higher rates/inflation desirable, argument for bigger stimulus even without big output gains.
JWMason1	701386767375716352	2016-02-21T12:43:31	Chinn: Based on past trends, output is well short of potential. But can't be because that's "implausible."  
JWMason1	701237667065888769	2016-02-21T02:51:02	This is a nice find.

JWMason1	701123011232055296	2016-02-20T19:15:26	Reminds me of Ellen Meiksins Wood's observation that etymology of "improve" is "make profitable." 
JWMason1	701121361536753664	2016-02-20T19:08:53	"I agree whole-heartedly with J.W. Mason -- a period of rapid growth in the United States is certainly possible." 
JWMason1	701120424822837250	2016-02-20T19:05:10	Ramanan_V No I was serious, I think he's right. I've been trying too much to score points, not enough to get things right.
JWMason1	701119968281231360	2016-02-20T19:03:21	Huh, delong has blocked me on twitter. Odd, I don't recall interacting with him here all.
JWMason1	701118822070280192	2016-02-20T18:58:47	Afraid he's right. It's easy to get caught up in polemic, hard to focus on getting things right. I should do better. 
JWMason1	701037748501815296	2016-02-20T13:36:38	Q's to focus on: would Clinton, Sanders policies close output gap? Spur inflation? Impact priv inv, spending? Affect supply side capacity?
JWMason1	700915542715142144	2016-02-20T05:31:02	_alexanderarnon gfriedma those are 1931-1941 through 1941-1951. So that plus WWII.
JWMason1	700914280598732800	2016-02-20T05:26:01	_alexanderarnon Personally I'm skeptical of TFP as anything but ex-post accounting construct.
JWMason1	700910576046714880	2016-02-20T05:11:18	Noahpinion TheStalwart I'm in
JWMason1	700909354183225345	2016-02-20T05:06:26	Noahpinion GDP still 10+ points below pre-2008 trend. No deviation like that since Depression. So I think experience of Depression relevant
JWMason1	700908843832836096	2016-02-20T05:04:25	Noahpinion Nah the trough was much worse. More like 1930 or 31.
JWMason1	700908449782218753	2016-02-20T05:02:51	_alexanderarnon gfriedma Not as bad as 1932, more like 1931. But yes.

JWMason1	700906677474877442	2016-02-20T04:55:48	Noahpinion Yes. I think they are relevant.  (Added a note clarifying the dates covered.)
JWMason1	700905646431059968	2016-02-20T04:51:42	Noahpinion Starts in 1925.
JWMason1	700905492600721409	2016-02-20T04:51:06	History suggests that growth rates in gfriedma paper just what you'd expect coming out of a hole like we're in now.

JWMason1	687041750846828544	2016-01-12T22:41:32	pilkingtonphil jacobinmag Mathematically, change in wage share = nom wage growth - inflation - labor prod growth. Just accounting.
JWMason1	686939948818280449	2016-01-12T15:57:01	pilkingtonphil jacobinmag Wages&gt;inflation + productivity = rising wage share. No more, no less.
JWMason1	686935469121212416	2016-01-12T15:39:13	pilkingtonphil jacobinmag Also recall "constant ULC" just means constant wage share. Which is NOT traditionally in Fed's mandate.
JWMason1	686935220310945793	2016-01-12T15:38:13	pilkingtonphil jacobinmag Non-increasing =/= constant.
JWMason1	686935117118455808	2016-01-12T15:37:49	pilkingtonphil jacobinmag You're right old rule should be prod. growth + inflation TARGET. What's new is using actual/expected inflation.
JWMason1	686933571811016704	2016-01-12T15:31:40	pilkingtonphil jacobinmag Nope. The new rule is actually invariant to inflation.
JWMason1	686930344306696192	2016-01-12T15:18:51	pilkingtonphil jacobinmag Old rule: Raise rates when ULC growth &gt; prod. growth. Now: raise when ULC growth &gt; prod. growth plus inflation.
