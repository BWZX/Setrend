doctorow	717686950027665409	2016-04-06T12:14:37	foodhistoryfan IP is used in contexts where something is digitized. We don't send bananas or feet or sound waves over IP.

doctorow	717686367510093825	2016-04-06T12:12:18	foodhistoryfan This distinction matters because it means that GCHQ deliberately introduced insecurity where security was possible
