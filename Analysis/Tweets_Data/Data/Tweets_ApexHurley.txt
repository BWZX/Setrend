ApexHurley	717183107724668928	2016-04-05T02:52:32	ApexHurley  Bottom line: if a deal spread is so wide, everytone loves it, and it seems like free money, you're missing something
ApexHurley	717183065924173824	2016-04-05T02:52:22	ApexHurley Pfizer's response to all of this will be key. I expect their first real comment to move spread ~5-7%

ApexHurley	717182982851833856	2016-04-05T02:52:02	ApexHurley Normally I'd say PFE should just fight this in court but if deal extends into 2017 congress they may fight with legislation
ApexHurley	717182935569448961	2016-04-05T02:51:51	ApexHurley  Key seems to be whether PF PFE equity in the 60-80% range ex-WCRX/FRX (vs. &lt;60% now; &gt;80% no bueno) - don't know yet

ApexHurley	717182840924979200	2016-04-05T02:51:28	ApexHurley Per contract language, I firmly believe this gives PFE the right to walk and pay $400MM. The question is whether they want to
ApexHurley	717182794926059521	2016-04-05T02:51:17	ApexHurley  Treasury can't block the deal; they can only frustrate the economics. This unquestionably makes deal worse
