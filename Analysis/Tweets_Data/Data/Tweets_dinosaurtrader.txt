dinosaurtrader	722204981558931456	2016-04-18T23:27:40	most of the time the ketchup and mustard covers up the spice taste anyway.
dinosaurtrader	722204749190295553	2016-04-18T23:26:44	basically, lots of spices are overrated. people love to call out subtle hints of flavor though... hence their enduring popularity.
