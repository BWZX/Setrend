chamath	701489805150937088	2016-02-21T19:32:57	chamath entrepreneurial discipline is very undervalued characteristic.
chamath	701489692953300992	2016-02-21T19:32:30	VinnyLingham not true. It's also b/c founders are increasingly lazy and don't want to consider things from 1st principles. Also product sux
chamath	701489096393248768	2016-02-21T19:30:08	guyfriedman No. It was because they gushed cash and could do it...all those people would have worked there regardless.

chamath	701487788026232832	2016-02-21T19:24:56	Bosefina stevesi owenthomas agreed. Benefits should be awesome. But perks adopt drive outcomes in my experience. Fallacy of misguided.
chamath	701487337780310016	2016-02-21T19:23:08	owenthomas No free food at Apple. People like to work at winning companies. Even when the food costs money. All else is window dressing.
chamath	701486964558602240	2016-02-21T19:21:40	VinnyLingham That's small ball. I'm the largest LP in our funds ($1.2B). Put up or shut up - it hurts more when my money pays for the food!

chamath	700948121723891712	2016-02-20T07:40:29	6/ Today's CEOs need to internalize this reality and stop falling for the hype cycle of raise $, spend$, fake growth, raise, spend repeat.
chamath	700947867175776256	2016-02-20T07:39:29	5/ But none of these companies relied on ongoing private mkts to fund their expansion or search for profitability.  They found it early on.
chamath	700947670253187072	2016-02-20T07:38:42	4/ AMZN is another example who takes it to the extreme.  Sinks every profit dollar into expanding their moat.
chamath	700947394922328066	2016-02-20T07:37:36	3/ These companies gush money into all kinds of things.  But their core business was profitable early on and could feed these other bets.
chamath	700947024632373248	2016-02-20T07:36:08	2/ The idea that the path to a massive outcome is massive losses before massive profits is misguided.  People are making up history.
