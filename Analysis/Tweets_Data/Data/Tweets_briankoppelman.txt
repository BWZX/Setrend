briankoppelman	720354687753388033	2016-04-13T20:55:15	traeu_saoe Carson is not qualified to judge Inarritu like that. He could never understand what the guy was after.

briankoppelman	720353098997174272	2016-04-13T20:48:56	13) When someone without produced credits that you like holds him/herself out as expert, please beware. They are usually full of shit. END
briankoppelman	720352971989454848	2016-04-13T20:48:26	12) Had the gall to think he could judge Inarritu's script for BIRDMAN! And judge it harshly.
briankoppelman	720352764820197377	2016-04-13T20:47:37	11) He, and his ilk, are bad for creativity, bad for young writers, bad for the entire endeavor. Again, this genius slammed -- had the gall
briankoppelman	720352593734533120	2016-04-13T20:46:56	10) Turned out we could. But jagoffs like Carson want young writers to thing there is only ONE way to win. One way to get it right.
briankoppelman	720352461639196674	2016-04-13T20:46:25	9) That was the whole fucking point. And the challenge to ourselves. Could we get you engaged without traditional rooting interest.
briankoppelman	720352370224279552	2016-04-13T20:46:03	8) And total engagement can be mutually exclusive. It was no accident that Chuck and Bobby, in the pilot, seemed challenging to root for.
briankoppelman	720352206646476801	2016-04-13T20:45:24	7) And that's the real danger for young writers. His premise--that there better be a "hero" is entirely specious. Rooting interest...
briankoppelman	720352027906191360	2016-04-13T20:44:41	6) Someone just showed me his review. Carson hated it. And used it as a lesson in why a good script gives you someone to root for.
briankoppelman	720351813589807104	2016-04-13T20:43:50	5) Last year, for example, Carson reviewed an early draft of our pilot script for Billions.
briankoppelman	720351728697155586	2016-04-13T20:43:30	4) But they use their supposed knowledge to set themselves up as authorities.
briankoppelman	720351570693459968	2016-04-13T20:42:52	3) People like Carson, and Carson in particular, really don't know a thing about what works, what's good, or why.
briankoppelman	720351476334264321	2016-04-13T20:42:30	2) Carson, at his site, reviews screenplays before they are produced. He's the genius who hated the Birdman script. The problem is...
briankoppelman	720351248151482368	2016-04-13T20:41:35	1) Young writers put a lot of stock in the opinions of so called experts. One of those experts is Scriptshadow, Carson Reeves.

briankoppelman	719306231639379968	2016-04-10T23:29:04	Oh, it happened. Count on Nantz to go to the desperate, pathetic saccharine place.  
briankoppelman	719305852264529920	2016-04-10T23:27:33	"Who was your inspiration? Last Englishman to win 28 years ago..." And Willet goes right to his kid and wife and shuts Nantz down. Beauty.

briankoppelman	713163841086074880	2016-03-25T00:41:24	Regarding that (d-bag) food critic who tweeted GS wasn't funny. Can you even imagine being such a callous, miserable, narcissistic creep?
briankoppelman	713136379102961665	2016-03-24T22:52:16	Brian_Tallerico KellyAuCoin77 it's one of my absolute favorite episodes. KK did phenomena work. As you did, Kelly.
briankoppelman	713127838812135424	2016-03-24T22:18:20	Loss of Shandling feels like PS Hoffman and David Foster Wallace. Folks whose work just changed me. Made me see the world differently.
briankoppelman	713127478999515136	2016-03-24T22:16:54	Shandling's death is really heavy to me. Absolutely someone I considered among the funniest on earth. And with such a strong pov. Brutal.
briankoppelman	713117416990093313	2016-03-24T21:36:55	Garry Shandling was a very special comedian with a beautifully unpredictable mind. He even voluntarily offered jokes and ideas for Oscars.
briankoppelman	713116070572261376	2016-03-24T21:31:34	My dad raised me on comedy. Laughter was currency in our house &amp; few people delivered that like Garry Shandling. Sad to hear he passed away.
briankoppelman	713116368623763457	2016-03-24T21:32:45	I'd never claim friendship w/the great GarryShandling. He was a hero to me. And we hung out a few amazing times.  
briankoppelman	713115773976375296	2016-03-24T21:30:24	Yes. It is. One of few people ever who were meta and funny at exact same time. He actually delivered on both, fully. 
briankoppelman	713115494014971904	2016-03-24T21:29:17	stevecuozzo KeithOlbermann nothing made me laugh harder than Larry Sanders. Nothing.
briankoppelman	713114610535178243	2016-03-24T21:25:46	.brubaker GarryShandling yes. There are few figures in my lifetime who were as consistently great, who were just excellent all the time.
briankoppelman	713110507704594432	2016-03-24T21:09:28	No way to articulate the amount of sheer joy GarryShandling brought me. As L Sanders. As a comic. &amp; the few times we hung out, as himself.

briankoppelman	711581774632099840	2016-03-20T15:54:50	LouiseMensch yes. but the kind of lying in which they engage, is particularly bad, I think.

briankoppelman	711580604538683392	2016-03-20T15:50:11	LouiseMensch yeah, he's pure evil too. No argument there.
briankoppelman	711579249426210816	2016-03-20T15:44:48	To be clear, McConnell is horrible in every way. But he's like Mr. Smith compared to Drumpf.
briankoppelman	711579089786773506	2016-03-20T15:44:10	I have always thought Mitch McConnell was the most evil politician imaginable, like a character from a horror movie. Drumpf is worse.
briankoppelman	711578767592988673	2016-03-20T15:42:53	But none of the journalists are actually challenging Drumpf in a meaningful way, except megynkelly. They all roll over in the end.
briankoppelman	711578519772336128	2016-03-20T15:41:54	See, even though I am a Democrat, I applaud chucktodd for holding Harry Reid accountable for his 2005 words. That's journalist's job.

briankoppelman	711562535758073856	2016-03-20T14:38:23	I was 7 when Nixon resigned. My mom made me watch, so I'd always remember the low point of our nation. So when I say this is worse...
briankoppelman	711562185823150080	2016-03-20T14:36:59	I was alive for Watergate, but this is worse than Nixon for what it says about a huge portion of populace and the pathetic state of media.
briankoppelman	711561992176332800	2016-03-20T14:36:13	Our age of outrage almost makes reaction to Drumpf seem tepid, normal. But it isn't. This is worst American political moment of my lifetime.
briankoppelman	711559993137491968	2016-03-20T14:28:17	Yes. I agree. chucktodd is doing better than any other mainstream journalist.

briankoppelman	711558680982978561	2016-03-20T14:23:04	The first amendment protects our rights to speak without GOVERNMENTAL interference.
briankoppelman	711558443019210752	2016-03-20T14:22:07	I really beg chucktodd (whom I like and respect) to correct Drumpf the next time he or surrogates misuse the term 1st Amendment protections

briankoppelman	708420165445111808	2016-03-11T22:31:43	This article about Ted Cruz is the single most insightful, accurate piece I've seen. A must read. True in every way.

briankoppelman	708656382774517760	2016-03-12T14:10:22	HarlanCoben they were outside the venue. But my real point is that first amendment doesn't apply. And it's rhetorical misuse is gross.
briankoppelman	708656130139033600	2016-03-12T14:09:22	PatrickMillsaps SHO_Billions thanks! We love hearing that.

briankoppelman	708649998305591296	2016-03-12T13:45:00	First Amendment protects unpopular speech from Gov't censorship. It gives protest speech the ability to shout down other speech.
briankoppelman	708649563767377920	2016-03-12T13:43:16	shorepatrol JustinSayfie first amendment says the gov't won't stop you. And won't stop protect speech either.
briankoppelman	708649226679537664	2016-03-12T13:41:56	Also, this idea being advanced by Trump army that the protests are illegitimate because they are planned is ludicrous. Selma was planned.
briankoppelman	708648952665657345	2016-03-12T13:40:51	On CNN JustinSayfie's actually invoking 1st Amendment as reason to shut down protest. He's smart enough to know the reasons that's false.
briankoppelman	708648572607139840	2016-03-12T13:39:20	The Orwellian use of "first amendment protections" by Trump and his mouthpieces is just so gross. JustinSayfie I'm looking at you.
briankoppelman	708635361304584192	2016-03-12T12:46:50	Imagine if someone had said 5 years ago that AnnCoulter would be denouncing Fox News as the traitorous oligarchy

briankoppelman	702678361194237952	2016-02-25T02:15:51	MrTimHerlihy Absolutely. You deliver both of them to the series, you can finally have that writers' assistant gig.
briankoppelman	702678071862824961	2016-02-25T02:14:42	4) And Judd Apatow and  Amy Schumer too, who, it's easy to forget, are screenwriters of the highest order.
briankoppelman	702677328753774592	2016-02-25T02:11:44	3) These writers know so much about the craft, about why they do what they do, it's kind of stunning. I wish I had pods to hear growing up.
briankoppelman	702677081495375872	2016-02-25T02:10:45	2) Tony Gilroy, Scott Frank, Danny Strong, Richard LaGravenese, Tom McCarthy, John Hamburg, Craig Mazin. Anna Boden/Ryan Fleck Amy Koppelman

briankoppelman	702636038825631744	2016-02-24T23:27:40	I just don't want a bully for president. I don't think it's a good idea. And I think it's a bad misreading of the phrase "bully pulpit."

briankoppelman	699383038669623298	2016-02-16T00:01:24	4) And the wrestlers in the magazines seemed more dangerous and real than the ones I watched. Because on TV I could see the pulled punches.

briankoppelman	698165774389788673	2016-02-12T15:24:26	RyanWallsTweets In drama, the characters are speaking as people in their shoes would. Audience decides how to regard them.
briankoppelman	698165601034969088	2016-02-12T15:23:45	RyanWallsTweets Is Ackley echoing Salinger's thoughts? Is Carbone speaking for Arthur Miller? That's such a bizarre question.
briankoppelman	698165374827786240	2016-02-12T15:22:51	RyanWallsTweets I don't even understand the question. From a professional writer? Characters in a drama are NEVER assumed to be echoing.

briankoppelman	698160821629816832	2016-02-12T15:04:45	davehill77 I could make you a playlist from those 4 albums that would be better than almost any album ever by anyone else.
briankoppelman	698160438207451136	2016-02-12T15:03:14	davehill77 You know I am an atheist. But those are some of my favorite albums. He's my favorite artist who ever lived in all the arts.
briankoppelman	698159788962791424	2016-02-12T15:00:39	davehill77 but Dylan's public pronouncements are not at all douche-tastic like this guy's.

briankoppelman	698159113356890112	2016-02-12T14:57:58	3) But it is becoming much more difficult to listen to KW's music. Years from now, I imagine all that will be left is the genius part.
briankoppelman	698158343559520257	2016-02-12T14:54:54	2) I have long believed that the art and artist ought to be considered entirely separately.
briankoppelman	698157797930881024	2016-02-12T14:52:44	1) The hour MBDTF came out, I tweeted that I hated the fact that someone as insufferable as KW had made on of the best albums of all time.
briankoppelman	698157380807294976	2016-02-12T14:51:05	chrisbeggs ianspaterson to me, the difference is that KW is an actual artistic genius, a true giant, just also insufferable.

briankoppelman	697779750031532032	2016-02-11T13:50:31	FuelOnline the way I use private lists is to make them mini-timelines. I add exactly the folks whose tweets I never want to miss.

briankoppelman	697779236321542146	2016-02-11T13:48:28	FuelOnline right. But can't you make lists that function the same way? Even more so because you do it.

briankoppelman	688727384682590208	2016-01-17T14:19:39	So that's one answer to a common question: how does a writer craft great dialog? By listening and noticing when it's done really well.
briankoppelman	688727001524514817	2016-01-17T14:18:07	Writers: the father to son advice in JasonIsbell's Outfit is dialog on the highest level. Full characters created, unique vernacular, real.
