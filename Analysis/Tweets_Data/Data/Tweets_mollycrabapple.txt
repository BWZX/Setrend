mollycrabapple	716681860609351680	2016-04-03T17:40:45	PKhakpour was on plane, so no, but will check it out.
mollycrabapple	716681389765226496	2016-04-03T17:38:53	PKhakpour this last piece though isn't satire. It's straight up demonization and "destroying the gray zone"
mollycrabapple	716681094846877697	2016-04-03T17:37:42	PKhakpour like, Riad Sattouf is a brilliant artist who worked for CH for years. What happened was the magazine became a symbol
mollycrabapple	716680915775320065	2016-04-03T17:37:00	PKhakpour for me, what I didn't like about some critics was equating the life's work of all CH artists with Charb's worst
mollycrabapple	716673973573066752	2016-04-03T17:09:25	The CH article is repellent bigotry. One cannot hold murdered artists responsible for something written a year after their deaths.
mollycrabapple	716673271236788229	2016-04-03T17:06:37	PPkzd I read French, am familiar with French comics, and hate how,say, Cabu had his whole life's work reduced to Charb's worst stuff
mollycrabapple	716672427447742465	2016-04-03T17:03:16	I defended CH cartoonists after the murders because I hated elderly, diverse artists being reduced to the worst thing their publication ran
mollycrabapple	716672186581389312	2016-04-03T17:02:19	The latest Charlie Hebdo editorial is dangerous, paranoid racism
