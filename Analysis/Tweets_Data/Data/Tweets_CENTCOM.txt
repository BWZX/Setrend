CENTCOM	723537778093465600	2016-04-22T15:43:43	Again, this fight will take time and there is still a lot of tough fighting ahead, but momentum continues to move in the right direction
CENTCOM	723537705079050241	2016-04-22T15:43:26	Their lines of communication between places like Mosul, Raqqah and Anbar have become more and more isolated from each other
CENTCOM	723537575156264961	2016-04-22T15:42:55	While they aren’t fractured yet, they are having a much harder time across Iraq and Syria
CENTCOM	723537456746926080	2016-04-22T15:42:27	As Coalition continues to dismantle ISIL, we are working to fracture the them to a point they can no longer operate as cohesive organization
CENTCOM	723537288639160320	2016-04-22T15:41:46	Since then, Coalition-backed forces have liberated Al Hasakah, Sinjar, Tishreen Dam, Ramadi, Shaddadi and the western part of Hit
CENTCOM	723537032920870912	2016-04-22T15:40:45	Nine months ago the Iraqis liberated Bayji and the oil refinery complex
CENTCOM	723536799633674240	2016-04-22T15:39:50	12 months ago, the Iraqis liberated Tikrit. Today thousands of citizens have returned to their homes there, they are opening up their shops
CENTCOM	723536686177746945	2016-04-22T15:39:23	Still tough fighting ahead, but noteworthy that it was about 15 months ago that Coalition-enabled indigenous ground forces liberated Kobani
CENTCOM	723536512336445440	2016-04-22T15:38:41	ISIL has less freedom of movement between key areas, they're shutting down internet cafes and cutting fighters’ salaries
CENTCOM	723536403531993089	2016-04-22T15:38:15	We're seeing  a heavy reliance on roadside bombs and snipers to delay ISF advance

CENTCOM	718467120556875776	2016-04-08T15:54:44	Will include scenarios that range from mine countermeasures, infrastructure protection &amp; maritime security in support of civilian shipping.
CENTCOM	718467000830439424	2016-04-08T15:54:16	The exercise is focused on maritime security from the port of origin to the port of arrival
CENTCOM	718466930944946176	2016-04-08T15:53:59	This includes mine countermeasures, maritime security operations, and maritime infrastructure protection

CENTCOM	718466527738118145	2016-04-08T15:52:23	Elsewhere in the CENTCOM AOR, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command kicked off its International Mine Countermeasures Exercise this week
CENTCOM	718466271617163265	2016-04-08T15:51:22	These airstrikes were focused on targeting key Al Qaida leaders who pose a threat to the US, our allies and our national security interests
CENTCOM	718466168227565568	2016-04-08T15:50:57	These were U.S. airstrikes conducted against Al Qaida. They are not a part of the counter-ISIL campaign
CENTCOM	718465997011881985	2016-04-08T15:50:16	Also this week, there were two counterterrorism strikes conducted by CENTCOM against core AlQaeda operatives on Sunday and Tuesday
CENTCOM	718465772448792576	2016-04-08T15:49:23	While we clearly have a ways to go and much fighting remains ahead, we believe that for now the momentum is going in the right direction

CENTCOM	718465356315160576	2016-04-08T15:47:44	Will continue assisting the Iraqis to eventually regain control of their sovereign territory from these terrorists
CENTCOM	718465263994322946	2016-04-08T15:47:22	Over the last year, we have weakened ISIL. Now we are focused on fracturing ISIL to the point it becomes militarily ineffective
CENTCOM	718465189683838976	2016-04-08T15:47:04	2nd phase also focused on isolating &amp; dismantling ISIL on the ground until they can't sustain themselves or operate as cohesively
CENTCOM	718464849471217664	2016-04-08T15:45:43	2nd phase: Focused on continuing to enable our partners to take the fight to ISIL, to further degrade their combat capability
CENTCOM	718464562585014273	2016-04-08T15:44:34	We are working to enable forces that can maintain security to newly liberated areas—much like we see in places like Tikrit
CENTCOM	718464448759996423	2016-04-08T15:44:07	We are helping the Iraqis build combat power in order to posture them to conduct effective and sustained offensive operations going forward
CENTCOM	718464322461155328	2016-04-08T15:43:37	While they can still put together some complex attacks, for almost a year they have not been able to take and hold any key terrain
CENTCOM	718464197865172992	2016-04-08T15:43:07	That is a very different image from the one you see today. ISIL can no longer operate in large maneuvering formation

CENTCOM	690567108212723712	2016-01-22T16:10:03	In the past few weeks, these combined forces have successfully repelled more than a dozen ISIL attacks.
