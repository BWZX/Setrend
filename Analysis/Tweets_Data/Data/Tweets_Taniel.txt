Taniel	725166622776918016	2016-04-27T03:36:10	And Trump's number should still rise as the last 20 winners are clarified. You can follow my compiling here:

Taniel	725155920641163265	2016-04-27T02:53:38	Calvin Tucker won unbound slot in PA CD2. He hadn't committed to anything yet —not even district winner)—but just said on CNN he leans Trump
Taniel	725155044442648576	2016-04-27T02:50:09	Actually, Trump's won MD08 easily thanks to huge leads in Carroll/Frederick. It's a sweep.  
Taniel	725154920819732481	2016-04-27T02:49:40	It looks like Trump's 3-delegate slate swept the 3 spots from Pennsylvania's 4th district, where 15 people were on the ballot.

Taniel	725146748650414080	2016-04-27T02:17:12	Yea, Trump was expected to do very well tonight. But this is just a disaster for anti-Trump forces any way you look at it.
Taniel	725146141361328128	2016-04-27T02:14:47	Kasich had very real hopes of winning multiple MD districts based on DC suburbs. Trump up between 20% &amp; 45% in all 7 districts with results.
Taniel	725144399571783681	2016-04-27T02:07:52	As of tonight, Cruz is mathematically eliminated from a first ballot win even if he wins all bound, unbound, &amp; uncommitted delegates left.
Taniel	725143236784865289	2016-04-27T02:03:14	Trump leading in all 7 Maryland districts that have any results reporting. Up double-digits in all but one (CD7). No results yet from CD8.

Taniel	725138826256076800	2016-04-27T01:45:43	Maybe I should take that back: Trump may be under 67%, but Cruz is under 10%. If that holds, Trump would get that extra delegate anyway.

Taniel	725132969564844032	2016-04-27T01:22:26	That doesn't hold in all districts, but certainly looks like many Trump supporters will be elected among Pennsylvania's unbound delegates.

Taniel	724590476410687488	2016-04-25T13:26:46	Check out Cruz's favorability ratings among **just Republicans** (this is CT, PA, &amp; RI respectively) in ppppolls:

Taniel	724433852861550592	2016-04-25T03:04:24	So I'm not exactly sure what Kasich gets out of this—his haul won't change dramatically in OR &amp; NM—other than less accusations of spoiling.

Taniel	722620868979986432	2016-04-20T03:00:15	NickBaumann Not sure, with a split Cruz/Kasich vote, non-impressive plurality cd be enough. And a few Western opportunities to compensate.
Taniel	722620476376367104	2016-04-20T02:58:41	For Trump to get 1237, everything needed to go well in NY, PA, MD, DE, CT, WV, IN, NJ, CA.  He checks off NY—&amp; looks strong in next 4. Then?
Taniel	722617692499415040	2016-04-20T02:47:38	We have state Senate numbers here, and GOP is dominating 60-39 with 20% in 
Taniel	722617825857310724	2016-04-20T02:48:09	Clinton led Trump 61-32 in NBC/Marist &amp; 55-35 in ppppolls in NY polls released in the past 10 days. 
Taniel	722616624650526720	2016-04-20T02:43:23	With New York, the share of remaining bindable delegates that Trump needs (for 1237 bound) will drop from 67% to 62-63%.
Taniel	722613496354050048	2016-04-20T02:30:57	Trump will get between 85 and 94 delegates from New York (out of 95). He's only in danger of losing one district, clearly above 50% in most.
Taniel	722612069955198980	2016-04-20T02:25:17	Based on  projection of NY's count, share of remaining pledged delegates Sanders needs will jump from 56.3% to ≈58.5%

Taniel	722606525370474496	2016-04-20T02:03:15	Clinton's statewide win driven by blow-out victory in NYC: at moment, 53% Staten Island, 60% Brooklyn, 61% Queens, 66% Manhattan, 70% Bronx.

Taniel	722603726213660672	2016-04-20T01:52:08	You can follow the AP's district-by-district results in the GOP primary here: 
Taniel	722603491915669504	2016-04-20T01:51:12	At this moment, Trump above 50% in 22 of 26 districts from which AP has calculated results; 45%-49% range in CD10, CD12, CD20, CD24.
Taniel	722602843694358529	2016-04-20T01:48:37	Nate_Cohn The AP has Trump leading 45% to 34% with 438/523 precincts reporting in NY10.

Taniel	722601762989940736	2016-04-20T01:44:20	Everyone expected Trump to do (very) well in Staten Island—but wow: 
Taniel	722601375109148673	2016-04-20T01:42:47	All eyes on New York tonight, but a potentially big announcement coming in Michigan tomorrow: 
Taniel	722599475152195585	2016-04-20T01:35:14	It looks clear that Trump is on track to be under 50% in at least NY10: Cruz strong in Borough Park, Kasich strong in Lower Manhattan.
Taniel	722593740750237696	2016-04-20T01:12:27	4 precincts are already reporting in Staten Island, &amp; Trump has... 80% there at the moment.
Taniel	722592753738231808	2016-04-20T01:08:32	Trump above or close to 50% in all regions, so prepare for a big delegate haul, with close calls in some districts: 
Taniel	722592299297988608	2016-04-20T01:06:43	55% of NY's GOP voters wd *definitely* vote for Trump in Nov., 36% definitely for Kasich, 27% definitely for Cruz. 
Taniel	722591586962550784	2016-04-20T01:03:54	NY called for Trump, but of course question has long been how much he wins by: If he is indeed above 50%, he gets all 14 at-large delegates.

Taniel	722586749801734145	2016-04-20T00:44:40	As with every election night, I'll be updating the delegate totals on both sides as CD-level counts firm up here:

Taniel	722548792969543680	2016-04-19T22:13:51	One explanation: Many delegates chosen by party leaders at State Committee Meeting, not at a convention, which explains how Kasich&gt;Cruz.

Taniel	718928980682895360	2016-04-09T22:30:00	stevemmitchell correct.
Taniel	718928755004215296	2016-04-09T22:29:06	What delegate fights come down to: If any group allocated an *uneven* number, even a 50.001% win would be enough for Sanders to net some.
Taniel	718928245937278978	2016-04-09T22:27:05	You can see what this process looks like in the (always awesome) 's calculation chart: 
Taniel	718927784584863744	2016-04-09T22:25:15	Calculate 56% of 8, 4, 2, &amp; round each to nearest whole #: Each fraction rounds *down* to 4, 2, 1. So each group rounds to equal split.
Taniel	718927224263548928	2016-04-09T22:23:01	Instead, the 14 are divided in 3 groups (8 CD, 2 PLEO, 4 at-large). There's separate proportional allocation of the delegates of each group.
Taniel	718926983393124352	2016-04-09T22:22:04	14 delegates get allocated proportionally—BUT not in single calculation.   (If they were, 14 dels split 56/44 would mean a 8-6 split.) (2/5)
Taniel	718926642840760320	2016-04-09T22:20:43	So Sanders won Wyoming by 11.4%, but that has translated to a projected 7-7 split in pledged delegates. Why? I'll try to explain rules (1/5)

Taniel	718912685627305985	2016-04-09T21:25:15	To get what he needs out of Goshen, Sanders will need the support of 70% of that county's caucus-goers. He did get that in 2 other counties.

Taniel	718903886094999552	2016-04-09T20:50:17	ForecasterEnten It depends on how many state delegates they're allocating. if he wins 3-2, yes; if he wins 5-4, I don't think so.

Taniel	716662092036763648	2016-04-03T16:22:12	ND delegates have to choose 25 names among this long list; but Trump/Kas camps didn't circulate recommendations...

Taniel	716443022129553408	2016-04-03T01:51:42	Clinton's NV delegate lead was a virtual 20-15 after caucuses. My understanding is that it's a still-virtual 18-17 after county conventions.
Taniel	716442007225372672	2016-04-03T01:47:40	lawful_awful yes, I saw that; it's my understanding too, but it's all so convoluted and multi-tiers of rules and confusions.
Taniel	716439937747456000	2016-04-03T01:39:26	desmoinesdem ducdunord ha, Clark does represent two-thirds of the state though.
Taniel	716439462025232384	2016-04-03T01:37:33	mseyfang I see that line—but language of 7.a (pages 14/15) seems to be saying that this is not true, that caucuses bind national CD dels.
Taniel	716438600141901824	2016-04-03T01:34:07	As ducdunord points out, caucuses' multi-stage system really compounds problem of people needing to take off many hours they may not have.

Taniel	716432513816793088	2016-04-03T01:09:56	mseyfang I was looking at this language—what passage are you thinking of? 
Taniel	716431306331176961	2016-04-03T01:05:08	mseyfang yes—changed after. district dels seem to be tied to preferences of February 20th caucuses, however. is that your understanding?
Taniel	716429659169275904	2016-04-03T00:58:36	yes, delegate allocation shd be settled by ppl's actual votes. have conventions for other party business—not this. 
Taniel	716429064660238336	2016-04-03T00:56:14	Similar in 2008: Clinton won NV, but Obama was projected to win delegate count 13-12, &amp; ended up winning count 14-11 after state convention.
Taniel	716428582826995713	2016-04-03T00:54:19	If that's right about district dels, worst-case scenario for Clinton after May's state convention is 18-17 spit for her (instead of 20-15).

Taniel	716427107312803840	2016-04-03T00:48:27	armandodkos I believe "caucus" would be referring to the February 20th vote. 
Taniel	716426477982625793	2016-04-03T00:45:57	How I understand NV rules:  1. district dels allocated based on caucuses 2. at-large dels—based on state convention
Taniel	716425338734133248	2016-04-03T00:41:25	RalstonReports more important factor is that 'state shifting' may not matter bc atdleft says at-large dels bound to Feb results. checking.

Taniel	716422400561250304	2016-04-03T00:29:45	stephenbirman meganmesserly definitely.
Taniel	716422150530445314	2016-04-03T00:28:45	atdleft gained based on the February results? That would mean a majority of state convention dels for him, no (if they show up!)?
Taniel	716421354698973184	2016-04-03T00:25:36	and that may not even be the end of the story, per atdleft: 
Taniel	716421042659528704	2016-04-03T00:24:21	Sanders won NV outside of Clark, so this could mean Sanders having more state convention delegates—contingent on other county conventions.
Taniel	716420311357472768	2016-04-03T00:21:27	atdleft RalstonReports so this does mean that Clark County is sending more state convention delegates who are Sanders supporters?

Taniel	716418117501632514	2016-04-03T00:12:44	nickspencer that's not a very accurate way of describing thousands of Clinton delegates not showing up at the county convention.
Taniel	716417554818985985	2016-04-03T00:10:30	Slicknickshady this is mostly about Clinton delegates just not showing up at the county convention.
Taniel	716416700997115904	2016-04-03T00:07:06	NV: Clinton got 55% of Clark Co.'s 8702 delegates in February—but meganmesserly reports SANDERS won among ≈5400 who showed up at convention
Taniel	716415826333708288	2016-04-03T00:03:38	RalstonReports Sanders winning NV outside of Clark, so if Clark sent more Sanders dels at state convention that cd mean he has more—no?
Taniel	716414043674779648	2016-04-02T23:56:32	RalstonReports would it not reverse the at-large delegate count as well? (doesn't Clinton's statewide lead hinge on a Clark County lead?)

Taniel	714956739368587266	2016-03-29T23:25:44	Yes, it would appear delegates can withhold Rule 40 support to candidate they're bound to—though some ambiguity.

Taniel	714901911640621056	2016-03-29T19:47:52	Then Rules 15.f.9-10 state that delegates of dropped out candidates (earlier defined as not maintaining active campaign) get re-allocated.

Taniel	712476242377883648	2016-03-23T03:09:08	To be clear—this is based on about 260K votes already! (There were 540K total voters in the GOP's Arizona primary in 2008.)

Taniel	712414701540474880	2016-03-22T23:04:35	Taniel I think that Kasich needs to show donors that he can pick up a big chunk of the remaining Rubio vote.

Taniel	712413012582408192	2016-03-22T22:57:52	And I'm not sure how I'm supposed to even assess what Kasich needs.
Taniel	712411778576162820	2016-03-22T22:52:58	Condensed benchmarks: Trump needs winner-take-all AZ, Cruz probably needs 50% in UT, &amp; Sanders needs wins big enough to net many delegates.

Taniel	712000383678357504	2016-03-21T19:38:14	FuMikechu Sure—but the anti-Kasich argument at the moment is that in entering Utah he has risked helping Trump get to 1237.

Taniel	710970582226100224	2016-03-18T23:26:10	SeanTrende even then, you're mainly arguing it's unclear what he'll be. which is a bigger upside for Rs than many names Clinton cld appoint
Taniel	710970231510978560	2016-03-18T23:24:47	SeanTrende Maybe; the evidence that he is cautious seems to be a bit stronger than he's just waiting to get to the Court to become Brennan.

Taniel	710968899924267008	2016-03-18T23:19:29	SeanTrende that seems too simple to me. needing to woo just Breyer for big liberal shifts easier than needing Garland &amp; Breyer.

Taniel	710568972891115522	2016-03-17T20:50:19	In a 2-way race for Cruz, Trump can realistically expect 110-115+ of NY &amp; CT's 123 dels.  Good plurality wins in a 3-way race wld mean ≈70.

Taniel	710552170001735680	2016-03-17T19:43:33	59% sounds high, but:  1—Trump got 62% of 03/15 delegates 2—large majority of boundable dels left are WTA either statewide or by district
Taniel	710550918517956612	2016-03-17T19:38:35	By my count, share of the *boundable* delegates left each needs to end up with 1237 bound delegates:  Trump 59% Cruz 88% Kasich 119%

Taniel	710548324340858880	2016-03-17T19:28:16	Trump now has 11 "Rule 40" states.  Cruz: 4. (5 if Rubio's AK dels get reallocated, per rules on "dropped out" candidates.)  Kasich: 1.
Taniel	710547502374756354	2016-03-17T19:25:00	No. In 3-way race, 15% threshold doesn't apply. So as long as Cruz is under 50%, Trump gets Utah delegates.

Taniel	710536349342949376	2016-03-17T18:40:41	ForecasterEnten so either Cruz gets 50%, or else everyone is getting delegates. right?
Taniel	710536113442660353	2016-03-17T18:39:45	SeanTrende davidbylerRCP yes—that's why I think this is primarily a window into the problem Cruz is running into with the CD distribution.
Taniel	710535377241640960	2016-03-17T18:36:49	Hard to overstate concentration of Cruz's vote: Despite statewide tie, Trump came closer to winning 7/8 delegates than Cruz was to 4/8.
Taniel	710534471888588800	2016-03-17T18:33:13	davidbylerRCP It's quite dramatic: Trump was closer to winning 7 of the 8 districts than Cruz was to winning a 4th. Very concentrated vote.

Taniel	710529527802404864	2016-03-17T18:13:35	I get Kasich hopes for 6-10 Utah dels. But keeping Trump at 0 in UT really is basic step in blocking him from 1237.

Taniel	710524589437292545	2016-03-17T17:53:57	mikeyavo Definitely. If Trump were to hover around 50% statewide in NY, and cross it in many districts, it could be very decisive.

Taniel	710522213028536320	2016-03-17T17:44:31	px75 oh yes, was assuming as much!
Taniel	710521216709304320	2016-03-17T17:40:33	Bottom-line: It won't take a big stumble for Trump to fall short. But he does not have to do any better than he's been doing to get to 1237.
Taniel	710518665607847936	2016-03-17T17:30:25	I'll let you all decide if it's more likely Trump underperforms that mark (in CA? NY? WI? NJ? IN?), or overperforms it (in NY? UT? CT? CA?).
Taniel	710518088563879936	2016-03-17T17:28:07	Road ahead, in brief: If Trump wins upcoming states as he did IL &amp; MI (≈40-30-30), except being shut out of UT/NE/SD/CO/WY, he's around 1237
Taniel	710517409602543617	2016-03-17T17:25:25	hsmythwithaY sorry, that's incorrect. many states are WTA, or WTA at district levels. a 40-30-30 win statewide shld be enough to win most.
Taniel	710513190707335168	2016-03-17T17:08:40	hsmythwithaY no, that's excessive; he can lose WTA states like NE &amp; SD, &amp; win most states with the type of margin he had in IL.

Taniel	710230018069291008	2016-03-16T22:23:26	It was the same in MI. In a 3-way race, such splits help Trump tremendously in states with at least some WTA statewide dels (PA, CA, IN...).

Taniel	707394441087205376	2016-03-09T02:35:52	7 polls of Michigan were released in March: Clinton led by 11, 13, 17, 24, 27, 28, &amp; 37 (!). Sanders is up 4.6% with 395K votes in.

Taniel	707390310251413504	2016-03-09T02:19:27	Michigan &amp; Mississippi (from which Rubio is probably being shut out) have as many delegates combined as Florida. Can't all be about 1 state.
Taniel	707389841005285378	2016-03-09T02:17:35	Why? If there we no thresholds, Rubio wd get 7-8 dels based on current MI &amp; MS s. Instead, these get allocated among others—many to Trump.
Taniel	707389021715087361	2016-03-09T02:14:20	Rubio missing MI &amp; MS's modest thresholds isn't just bad for him—also great for Trump bc it really increases # of delegates he can win.
Taniel	707387990566428672	2016-03-09T02:10:14	About 25% of all Michigan votes counted—&amp; Rubio doesn't have more than 12% in any county. Highly likely to be shut out of delegates.
Taniel	707386479543197699	2016-03-09T02:04:13	So Trump erased his mediocre week-end with 2 easy wins in today's bigger states; and Rubio's week went from bad to horrible.

Taniel	706539401690660866	2016-03-06T17:58:14	BrendanNyhan yes: there are plenty of signs Trump's voters are more firm early on, &amp; so early vote may not be representative.
Taniel	706538796691689474	2016-03-06T17:55:50	Toddkron yes, that's what I was referring to in my above tweets.
Taniel	706537230911799297	2016-03-06T17:49:37	tom_rando EJDionne I made that pt earlier: early votes not necessarily representative. But Rubio's collapse to 9% clearly more than that.

Taniel	706533669339586560	2016-03-06T17:35:28	allahpundit that's why interesting plot is Cruz-Trump: If they're clear top 2, both satisfy, neither at 1237, can RNC still go 3rd route?
Taniel	706533289419522049	2016-03-06T17:33:57	allahpundit that's quasi-impossible tho: with all WTA/WTM states, if Trump is the only candidate with 8+, hard to see how he's not at 1237
Taniel	706532213081268224	2016-03-06T17:29:40	hedgehogday FHQ this is part of the RNC rules: 
Taniel	706532015470997504	2016-03-06T17:28:53	allahpundit but the current language at least doesn't really allow to reiterate the initial process after the first ballot, no?

Taniel	706530226797412352	2016-03-06T17:21:47	allahpundit hmm that raises a whole other complication: delegates who are pledged to someone may not actually support—so would they sign?

Taniel	706507969555537920	2016-03-06T15:53:20	If state party confirms this, a huge get for Rubio: He'll have won 1 of 3 delegates in 5 of the state's 6 districts with just 11% statewide.

Taniel	706279961787830274	2016-03-06T00:47:19	this is incorrect. Kasich gets 1 statewide, Rubio 6 total (1 from CD3, 5 statewide). see:  
Taniel	706279946977726465	2016-03-06T00:47:16	MarcACaputo ME does have a WTA trigger (50%), and a 10% threshold. all statewide.

Taniel	706277852598112256	2016-03-06T00:38:56	seanmdav yes, he will end up with 24 because Kasich crossed 10%. He he not it wasn't .49 x25. it's qualified vote, not total vote.
Taniel	706277316893286400	2016-03-06T00:36:49	teddyschleifer that's not correct... Kasich has a delegate, Rubio gets a bunch more, in part bc of his win in the 3rd district.

Taniel	706258305245683712	2016-03-05T23:21:16	Especially given the post- 3/15 map, Trump would be much better off in a one-on-one with Cruz instead of Rubio.
Taniel	706254420921720834	2016-03-05T23:05:50	SteveKornacki not exactly: KS rounding rule is to round any remainder for winner up to nearest whole number, so 34% enough for 2 delegates.
