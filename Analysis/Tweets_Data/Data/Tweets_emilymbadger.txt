emilymbadger	703018680758587392	2016-02-26T00:48:09	MLKendricks I wouldn't want to look a low-income family in the eye and tell them the second goal matters more than the first.
emilymbadger	703017202773991425	2016-02-26T00:42:17	MLKendricks it's a potential upside of rising property values that wealth is created for long-time (often low-income) residents
emilymbadger	703016949718999040	2016-02-26T00:41:16	MLKendricks I don't know what it means to "let" residents cash out for as much as possible when we accept market works this way for others

emilymbadger	703015714613915649	2016-02-26T00:36:22	bruteforceblog I know MLKendricks is in Chicago, so I'm trying to adjust my math...
emilymbadger	703015420324814850	2016-02-26T00:35:12	MLKendricks middle-income fam that can afford to buy a $250k fixer-upper never has a chance to.
emilymbadger	703015214615121920	2016-02-26T00:34:23	MLKendricks in these places, I also think there's a missing middle to the market. say devs buy homes at 200k, resell at 500k...
emilymbadger	703014870900277248	2016-02-26T00:33:01	MLKendricks so in that scenario we're denying a fam who wants to move a chance to benefit from rising value bec "that adds to the problem"?
emilymbadger	703012149308698624	2016-02-26T00:22:12	MLKendricks and one of my concerns in other nhoods is that long-time residents who want to move out are exploited by developers/flippers
emilymbadger	703011958153326592	2016-02-26T00:21:26	MLKendricks I'm talking about how a program like this could be adapted in other neighborhoods.
emilymbadger	703011248099561472	2016-02-26T00:18:37	MLKendricks also, what I'm talking about is not flipping, it's fixing up a home to get a better value out of it
emilymbadger	703010932314640384	2016-02-26T00:17:22	MLKendricks that serves a diff goal. it lets a long-time resident who wants to move out benefit from rising values as much as possible

emilymbadger	702947896560189440	2016-02-25T20:06:53	jswiderski also, of course, depends on the market. I'm thinking $400k homes that get resold at $700k.
emilymbadger	702947765001678848	2016-02-25T20:06:21	jswiderski given that flippers convince families who don't know any better to sell below-market, I don't think that's a stretch.

emilymbadger	692024946579628032	2016-01-26T16:42:59	BmoreDoc I understand. here is a whole series of stories for you about your word to make amends: 
emilymbadger	692023718793584640	2016-01-26T16:38:06	BmoreDoc interestingly lots of people on twitter responded to that headline by saying "gee, I wonder if it's racism."
emilymbadger	692022332068593664	2016-01-26T16:32:35	BmoreDoc what can I say? I chip away at different perspectives on the central problem every day.
emilymbadger	692021893457670144	2016-01-26T16:30:51	BmoreDoc it is a giant, complex topic. I also left out mass incarceration, school segregation, housing discrimination, exclusionary zoning
emilymbadger	692020192738676736	2016-01-26T16:24:05	BmoreDoc I really don't get what we're arguing about here. whether you use the frame hypersegregation or systemic racism, all is connected
emilymbadger	692019715900882944	2016-01-26T16:22:12	BmoreDoc + how ppl oversimplify "oh, this is only about police brutality! oh, this can't be about race because there's a black mayor!" etc
emilymbadger	692019505204215808	2016-01-26T16:21:21	BmoreDoc it's my fault if you don't get the context there. but he is narrating how ppl struggle to interpret what's going on here
emilymbadger	692018715827765249	2016-01-26T16:18:13	BmoreDoc I don't know what you're talking about. he is NOT saying Baltimore is different. his whole point is that all are part of a whole
emilymbadger	692018434360676353	2016-01-26T16:17:06	BmoreDoc he is describing how the public interprets these scenes, not how he does. the whole piece is abt how he believes it *is* racism

emilymbadger	692007823543246848	2016-01-26T15:34:56	HousingWatchMD I'm not sure if you're criticizing his argument. but in fairness, my writing 500 words about it doesn't cover the half of it
emilymbadger	692007341168955393	2016-01-26T15:33:01	HousingWatchMD the entire piece is about him pleading w/ people to *see systemic racism*
emilymbadger	692006660248829952	2016-01-26T15:30:19	BmoreDoc hypersegregation is not in any way inconsistent with the argument here.
emilymbadger	692006393084272640	2016-01-26T15:29:15	HousingWatchMD hunh? He is not saying he doesn't know the answer, he's channeling how people react to the news.
