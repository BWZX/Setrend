CitySocialist	685778366994214912	2016-01-09T11:01:18	JediEconomist NicTrades why this language? Do you think its honest? Where is the 'import Muslim rape gangs' supporters?
CitySocialist	685778024021757952	2016-01-09T10:59:56	JediEconomist NicTrades I mean, if you show me muslims are more rapey than white people I won't be surprised.
CitySocialist	685777835437518848	2016-01-09T10:59:11	JediEconomist NicTrades yes there we agree I feel. QE, capture of state institutions by banks, leads to poor brown people rapin'

CitySocialist	685776813533081601	2016-01-09T10:55:08	JediEconomist NicTrades well thankfully this is the only example of roving gangs! The Rotherham lot mostly stayed put...

CitySocialist	685774813680525312	2016-01-09T10:47:11	JediEconomist but what do you think my motives are to argue class and gender are the problem not Islam?

CitySocialist	685773470911840256	2016-01-09T10:41:51	JediEconomist class and gender based violence is what I see. Religion is irrelevant - these are the global equivalent of the underclass =&gt;
CitySocialist	685773162987032577	2016-01-09T10:40:37	JediEconomist nope - would never argue against robust enforcement of the law against sex pests.
CitySocialist	685772086590193664	2016-01-09T10:36:21	JediEconomist that is true - but just as much of a problem that race and culture are easier to see than gender and class.
CitySocialist	685771904955867137	2016-01-09T10:35:37	JediEconomist why not take up the true fight mens violence against women - its all as bad.

CitySocialist	683691329050783746	2016-01-03T16:48:09	SirDickOfHearts on the precise wording of my own stupidity probably shows some self reflection might be a good plan!

CitySocialist	683640409524957185	2016-01-03T13:25:49	SirDickOfHearts i'm sure if I'd moved the terms of the argument like that, you'd be kicking off big time!
CitySocialist	683640145493540864	2016-01-03T13:24:46	SirDickOfHearts That is some pretty spectacular goalpost moving my friend :)
CitySocialist	683638227262136321	2016-01-03T13:17:09	SirDickOfHearts if costs &gt; revenues, why are private companies prepared to operate rail franchises?
CitySocialist	683637519892766721	2016-01-03T13:14:20	SirDickOfHearts I'm not trying because it's not the point. Your thinking on this is muddled because you don't understand funding.
CitySocialist	683634992153538561	2016-01-03T13:04:18	SirDickOfHearts =&gt; finance itself at negative real yields (it can), then it makes sense to buy them back. Do you agree?
CitySocialist	683634872305512448	2016-01-03T13:03:49	SirDickOfHearts £1 or £1bio, if the railways have a positive real yield (they do, hence companies bid for them), and the government can =&gt;
CitySocialist	683634740512055296	2016-01-03T13:03:18	SirDickOfHearts how generous of you! It doesn't matter whether the upfront cost of buying back the railways for the public purse is =&gt;
CitySocialist	683633740686438400	2016-01-03T12:59:19	SirDickOfHearts the costs to who?
CitySocialist	683632557641043969	2016-01-03T12:54:37	SirDickOfHearts a benefit in terms of cold hard cash - as the real yield of owning railways is positive, and issuing linkers is negative
CitySocialist	683632376417792000	2016-01-03T12:53:54	SirDickOfHearts I'm arguing it would not be a cost but a benefit.
CitySocialist	683632111077687296	2016-01-03T12:52:51	SirDickOfHearts who issued approx 130bio of bonds in 2015, so the impact on the overall UK funding picture would be negligible.
CitySocialist	683631576001961984	2016-01-03T12:50:43	SirDickOfHearts so long as it's &gt; -0.5%, then,  it's a benefit to the public purse not a cost. £2.5bio is small potatoes for the DMO =&gt;
CitySocialist	683631341490061316	2016-01-03T12:49:47	SirDickOfHearts now what would you say is the 'cost' of that? Well, that depends on the real yield of the asset (the railyway)
CitySocialist	683631199793852416	2016-01-03T12:49:13	SirDickOfHearts at a real yield of -0.5%. Fares are inflation protected so funding this way (with inflation protected bonds) is best.
CitySocialist	683630620979892224	2016-01-03T12:46:55	SirDickOfHearts franchise back at £2.5bio. The treasury could issue an extra £2.5bio of 8y linkers (the typical franchise length) =&gt;
CitySocialist	683630291634786304	2016-01-03T12:45:37	SirDickOfHearts right, but the question should not be how much it costs but rather how it's funded. Let's assume we have to buy the =&gt;
CitySocialist	683627771684323328	2016-01-03T12:35:36	SirDickOfHearts main point though is that whilst you can borrow money at negative real yields you should buy back positive yielding assets
CitySocialist	683627592348504064	2016-01-03T12:34:53	SirDickOfHearts lol - well I don't know the franchise rebates and stuff like that off the top of my head that's true.
CitySocialist	683627019570143232	2016-01-03T12:32:37	SirDickOfHearts sorry dude, bit busy - can I come back to you? Remind me if I forget!
