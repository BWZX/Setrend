LilianaSegura	691658955039252480	2016-01-25T16:28:39	SCOTUS ruling on automatic juvenile life sentences could affect hundreds in PA. Our story from October's arguments: 
LilianaSegura	691655467873927168	2016-01-25T16:14:48	While Montgomery is a step forward, the real goal is meaningful parole hearings. 
LilianaSegura	691655055913541632	2016-01-25T16:13:10	Also, keep in mind, all Miller entitles an inmate to is process. In many places judges will resentence to LWOP. 
LilianaSegura	691654869875200000	2016-01-25T16:12:25	Kudos to WV legislature for applying Miller retroactively - now the rest of the country catches up. 
LilianaSegura	691654586810159109	2016-01-25T16:11:18	Glad SCOTUS did the right thing on juvenile LWOP. But it never should have come to this. Some died in prison waiting for this to happen.
