awealthofcs	694224526507384832	2016-02-01T18:23:19	billygriffin22 right in that case it's "my advisor." I've just noticed no one ever calls a real advisor "my guy"
awealthofcs	694223223769165828	2016-02-01T18:18:09	lhamtil just the usual horror stories from friends/family members I hear on the weekends. "my guy" is usually not a great source of advice
awealthofcs	694222827323572224	2016-02-01T18:16:34	jamesacoxiii right he's my guy so he must know what he's talking about
awealthofcs	694221824805228544	2016-02-01T18:12:35	Not sure I've ever heard good investment advice follow after someone says, "My guy says I should invest in..."

awealthofcs	692510057687289857	2016-01-28T00:50:38	Guilty as charged. In my defense that one was a layup 
awealthofcs	692491652297048064	2016-01-27T23:37:30	PhlegCap lhamtil EconomPic William Bernstein is a proponent of this

awealthofcs	692463959773966336	2016-01-27T21:47:28	EconomPic lhamtil yup and have to have the ability to consistently hold your nose and rebalance
awealthofcs	692463746778841089	2016-01-27T21:46:37	shillcssb yup and too much emphasis on relative returns and what everyone else is doing
awealthofcs	692463215515672578	2016-01-27T21:44:30	lhamtil EconomPic seems to me like this is a good case for EM stocks long term as a small weighting

awealthofcs	692430738726195201	2016-01-27T19:35:27	billsweet JoeyFishman didn't the original guy go bankrupt the first time around?
awealthofcs	692426175596093445	2016-01-27T19:17:19	EconomPic are things really that different between everything in long-only active funds before or now more in long-only index funds?
awealthofcs	692425929013006336	2016-01-27T19:16:20	EconomPic of course, but it seems to me people are taking the index argument to the extreme.

awealthofcs	692413095281565696	2016-01-27T18:25:20	BasonAsset yeah the idea that corporate governance up to this point has been good is laughable

awealthofcs	692372583178567680	2016-01-27T15:44:22	EconomPic agreed. I say mandatory payout/lower tuition over a certain AUM level or you pay taxes
awealthofcs	692370274625417220	2016-01-27T15:35:11	BulldogAdvisors the situation you're describing is the minority IMO. it's mostly an ego thing for these places 
awealthofcs	692369776262397952	2016-01-27T15:33:12	SMTuffy that's why you use a smoothed payout ratio. but if you're screwed after one bad yr that's just a poor business model
awealthofcs	692369410980483072	2016-01-27T15:31:45	BulldogAdvisors if your organization is impacted by 1 yr of poor performance then you shouldn't be taking risk w/that $ in the first place
awealthofcs	692368449914458112	2016-01-27T15:27:56	BulldogAdvisors I wouldn't go that far. Very few provide a majority of annual funding. Most still comes from tuition expenses
awealthofcs	692368055431774209	2016-01-27T15:26:22	SMTuffy sure but that's 3-5% of the fund. the majority of the rest of these funds are a perpetuity and they raise $ each year
