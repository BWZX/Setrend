BrynneandRic	725840322157264897	2016-04-29T00:13:12	AmericanAir when they blow you off in peraon, you call the gold desk, when they suck..I guess you are left with robot tweets like this...
BrynneandRic	725839786875965440	2016-04-29T00:11:05	AmericanAir "years"
BrynneandRic	725839639613956096	2016-04-29T00:10:30	AmericanAir it's always good to know that 30 yes of loyalty and over 2 mil miles flown with you is worthless...americandoesntcare
BrynneandRic	725839251871506432	2016-04-29T00:08:57	AmericanAir why?
BrynneandRic	725838828955664384	2016-04-29T00:07:16	AmericanAir I guess all those bag fees and fuel surcharges weren't enough to move us beyond the 80's 
BrynneandRic	725837404834271233	2016-04-29T00:01:37	AmericanAir I would like to thank the Miami gate agent who yelled at me...stay classy AmericanAir

BrynneandRic	725831879392395264	2016-04-28T23:39:40	AmericanAir anyone notice that there are no POSITIVE remarks here???
BrynneandRic	725831707136561152	2016-04-28T23:38:58	"Pass it along" bwahahahahah!!!!!   
BrynneandRic	725831559572512768	2016-04-28T23:38:23	AmericanAir jolenelewis1 of course you have heard if any issues...you are a robot

BrynneandRic	725828523160641538	2016-04-28T23:26:19	AmericanAir the airline that screws you upfront and then insults your intelligence after.. .
BrynneandRic	725827996288999424	2016-04-28T23:24:14	AmericanAir the airline that only cares by "proxy" social media after the fact..
BrynneandRic	725827718592499712	2016-04-28T23:23:07	MatthewKeysLive I feel like the next step is drinks...then maybe friends...
BrynneandRic	725827480599318530	2016-04-28T23:22:11	AmericanAir always good to know that when you have a medical emergency and still show up on time....you will screw the passenger anyway
BrynneandRic	725827053136793601	2016-04-28T23:20:29	AmericanAir brought to you by the 1980's 
BrynneandRic	725826499425763328	2016-04-28T23:18:17	AmericanAir don't worry, haven't forgotten you...just have to get on another lame delayed flight on this ridic. Journey home
BrynneandRic	725824681408888832	2016-04-28T23:11:03	AmericanAir you "share" $1,000 with me that I spent due to your incompetence first.  Fair?
BrynneandRic	725824403716579328	2016-04-28T23:09:57	AmericanAir your complete disdain for the customer is not helped with a kindergarten pre-packaged tweet
BrynneandRic	725823897548001280	2016-04-28T23:07:56	AmericanAir contacted you 50+ hours ago....next question???
BrynneandRic	725823661924618240	2016-04-28T23:07:00	AmericanAir and...what exactly is my incentive for that??  It's much better to watch you bury yourself on twitter! 
BrynneandRic	725823137640792064	2016-04-28T23:04:55	But, doesn't this totally make them seem helpful to the naked eye? 
BrynneandRic	725822975044411392	2016-04-28T23:04:17	Uhmmm...you first.... 
BrynneandRic	725822901962833920	2016-04-28T23:03:59	AmericanAir so....just me asking...you want ME to help you???   Uhm....you first..
BrynneandRic	725822691454935040	2016-04-28T23:03:09	AmericanAir please don't even get me started on your lower input fuel costs that coexist with your fare raising shell game...
BrynneandRic	725822214545760257	2016-04-28T23:01:15	AmericanAir I know you bank on me going away...sorry, your incompetence is part of my larger agends.  Not going anywhere
BrynneandRic	725821831362535425	2016-04-28T22:59:44	BrynneandRic Yeah, agree..I choose emirates when I come to US;)
BrynneandRic	725821642082013184	2016-04-28T22:58:59	andrepaltry I DID warn everyone...
BrynneandRic	725821374074335232	2016-04-28T22:57:55	Please don't embarassed yourself. ... 
BrynneandRic	725821160198410240	2016-04-28T22:57:04	AmericanAir but you are dumb enough to have a robot tweeter....thanks for the material. ...
BrynneandRic	725820908099788801	2016-04-28T22:56:04	AmericanAir the thing is, I know you don't give a crap...
BrynneandRic	725820782195146752	2016-04-28T22:55:34	AmericanAir if by PAST...you mean RIGHT NOW...then we are on the same page...
BrynneandRic	725820399309754368	2016-04-28T22:54:02	But, wait...where were they yesterday when I "let them know" the flight number AmericanAir 
BrynneandRic	725820000246857728	2016-04-28T22:52:27	Unfortunately we are the new third world, can say that after 17 in 3rd world, actually Avianca air is more modern  
BrynneandRic	725820090546008065	2016-04-28T22:52:49	this is the most insulting response yet... 
BrynneandRic	725819703252365314	2016-04-28T22:51:16	AmericanAir NOT a past flight....a CURRENT flight because you SUCK
BrynneandRic	725819532422578177	2016-04-28T22:50:36	AmericanAir so, I am LIVING your incompetence as we speak....
BrynneandRic	725819214423011329	2016-04-28T22:49:20	AmericanAir so, which was YESTERDAY...ALL day....you only care when I go public...
BrynneandRic	725818811958484992	2016-04-28T22:47:44	AmericanAir my flight number was "yesterday" when you screwed me over...
BrynneandRic	725818619549081600	2016-04-28T22:46:58	AmericanAir please tell me what type of assistance you offer first... 
BrynneandRic	725818035605483520	2016-04-28T22:44:39	AmericanAir don't pretend to have an operation in Costa Rica
BrynneandRic	725817475326201856	2016-04-28T22:42:25	AmericanAir while I think it's cool that you saved a penny... zero airflow on a plane borders on criminal...
BrynneandRic	725817156638773249	2016-04-28T22:41:09	AmericanAir everything you do is wrong
BrynneandRic	725816790945796096	2016-04-28T22:39:42	AmericanAir what type of "assistance" is it that you offer? ??? 
BrynneandRic	725816511500275715	2016-04-28T22:38:36	AmericanAir I am curious...what type of assistance is it than you offer?
BrynneandRic	725816383376859137	2016-04-28T22:38:05	AmericanAir please, anyone, do not mistake this for customer service...
BrynneandRic	725815968446951424	2016-04-28T22:36:26	How cute is this??? 
BrynneandRic	725815835198115841	2016-04-28T22:35:54	AmericanAir assistance was needed yesterday....when you were too busy "NOT WORKING"  lateTotheParty
BrynneandRic	725815607711698948	2016-04-28T22:35:00	AmericanAir 
BrynneandRic	725815285110988800	2016-04-28T22:33:43	AmericanAir so, you provided NO assist the past 48 hours to us gold members. ...but, when I go public, now you have intereat?
BrynneandRic	725814878645178369	2016-04-28T22:32:06	I did warn everyone, right?  Sorry
BrynneandRic	725814603503034368	2016-04-28T22:31:01	AmericanAir chatter from the passengers.."wow, never been on a plane with such complete lack of airflow"
BrynneandRic	725814106905821184	2016-04-28T22:29:02	If this type of first class technology does it for you...then by all means...fly AmericanAir 
BrynneandRic	725813645930811392	2016-04-28T22:27:12	AmericanAir please control your satellite locations. ...they make you look bad...maybe you ARE bad 
BrynneandRic	725813052973654016	2016-04-28T22:24:51	AmericanAir I love hanging out on The tarmac after waiting 48 hours for this flight because your employees r lazy 
BrynneandRic	725812291715907584	2016-04-28T22:21:49	AmericanAir who then cost us $1000???  THEN I will help you...
BrynneandRic	725812047703859200	2016-04-28T22:20:51	AmericanAir could you please give me the name of the ONLY employee you had working yesterday that found it too difficult to do her job?

BrynneandRic	725809598964326400	2016-04-28T22:11:07	AmericanAir after your lazy employees left us hanging in Costa rica...we now sit in concentration camp conditions on the Miami tarmac
BrynneandRic	725808959370723331	2016-04-28T22:08:35	GotSanctuary right??  All airlines should be embarassed, specifically AmericanAir
BrynneandRic	725808623268564993	2016-04-28T22:07:15	AmericanAir I know it must be SUPER difficult to manage ONE flight a day out of Costa Rica. ...
