cjchivers	708028019886170112	2016-03-10T20:33:29	atschwitters agree. it's nasty stuff, &amp; condemned for good reason. but we should sketch the ISIS effort fully, bc context matters
cjchivers	708027390186942464	2016-03-10T20:30:58	pptsapper but to further contextualize we should note that ISIS has nothing like that kind of production/delivery capacity. so, not a match
cjchivers	708027081070923776	2016-03-10T20:29:45	pptsapper yes, mustard, when used in WW1 fashion -- v large barrages of weaponized shells, against fixed targets -- had high wounding rates
cjchivers	708026194273439748	2016-03-10T20:26:13	12) none of this is to say that mustard is not horrific. or that it does not deserve attention, action. but context was lost &amp; details odd.
cjchivers	708025570337136640	2016-03-10T20:23:45	11) bc as a chem-warfare story, or a step toward understanding the ISIS efforts w sulfur mustard, it was not helpful. just strange.
cjchivers	708025255726555136	2016-03-10T20:22:30	10) or was this primarily intended as an "information op" intended to say, "ha ha ISIS, your detainee sings in kurdish jail?"
cjchivers	708024669094473728	2016-03-10T20:20:10	9)  one wishes, reading the details, that pentagon flaks "leaking" the day story had brought in the DOD's chem experts for context, analysis
cjchivers	708023310903287808	2016-03-10T20:14:46	8) if he is really "about 50" then back during height of Iraq's mustard production, in the 80s, he was "about 16 to 23."
cjchivers	708022930006011904	2016-03-10T20:13:15	7) pentagon's claim that supposed top ISIS operative in mustard production is "about 50" &amp; worked in Baathist chem program also raises Q
cjchivers	708021654933344256	2016-03-10T20:08:11	6)  but this is not exactly "mustard in powder form" or "powdered mustard" as the pentagon source(s) put out there.
cjchivers	708021417544130561	2016-03-10T20:07:15	5) there is some history of sulfur mustard being used in "dusty mustard" form; in short: mustard agent mixed w fine solid particles.
cjchivers	708014681395470337	2016-03-10T19:40:28	4) And Pentagon's repeated description of ISIS &amp; mustard "powder" raise Qs; sulfur mustard is an oily liquid at ordinary ambient temps.
cjchivers	708014134802182144	2016-03-10T19:38:18	3) The data on WW1 mustard use varies, but fatality rates for exposure were very low; some studies put death rate at 6-7 percent.
cjchivers	708013814697086978	2016-03-10T19:37:02	2) (re PT) also worth remembering that mustard agent, even when pure &amp; effectively weaponized, is generally less lethal than many weapons.
cjchivers	708013414455574528	2016-03-10T19:35:26	Worth noting, w all the excitement about ISIS detainee who USG says gave info re mustard agent, that the DOD pitch feels, well, odd.
