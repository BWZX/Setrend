GregGuenthner	683706176287145984	2016-01-03T17:47:09	I'll shut up now
GregGuenthner	683705854747619329	2016-01-03T17:45:53	MakingAMurderer is about people who still believe the system is fair and just vs. those who have figured out that it's broken
GregGuenthner	683705562845065216	2016-01-03T17:44:43	Anyway, MakingAMurderer is about whether Seven Avery is guilty or not...and it's not about "evil" cops.
GregGuenthner	683704041524858880	2016-01-03T17:38:40	But I'm sure all the outraged internet detectives will move onto the next big case once the doc comes out /rant MakingAMurderer
GregGuenthner	683703733486792705	2016-01-03T17:37:27	And in our lives, we have no problem with the system rounding up “undesirables” who “cause trouble” in our own communities MakingAMurderer
GregGuenthner	683703598291808257	2016-01-03T17:36:55	…but we usually vilify those slimy, high-priced lawyers who dare to defend these scum criminals who should be behind bars MakingAMurderer
GregGuenthner	683703412169523200	2016-01-03T17:36:10	We cheer the police and prosecutors on film and TV when they get the confession or outsmart the suspect MakingAMurderer
GregGuenthner	683703158418309121	2016-01-03T17:35:10	MakingAMurderer merely shows how criminal justice really works. It’s the same system that most people in this country glorify, too.
GregGuenthner	683703023630200832	2016-01-03T17:34:38	2.Shocked judges, courts, and the state can’t find wrongdoing? Could have sworn the system’s job is to validate the system  MakingAMurderer
GregGuenthner	683702641348755456	2016-01-03T17:33:06	Tweet-storm incoming… I am surprised that everyone is up in arms over makingamurderer as if this stuff doesn’t happen all the time
