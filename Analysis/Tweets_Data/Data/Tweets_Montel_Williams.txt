Montel_Williams	715364467689672704	2016-03-31T02:25:54	And my view - I've repeatedly supported FB players engaging in brief prayer that doesn't require delaying game. 
Montel_Williams	715364142471712769	2016-03-31T02:24:37	PaulSchmehl think about it - a coach, a teacher in a position of power. Courts have upheld induv students voluntarily praying.

Montel_Williams	712486318580695044	2016-03-23T03:49:10	kylegriffin1 JWGOP btw anyone on the R side who thinks Bratton is a liberal doesn't know Bill Bratton very well.
Montel_Williams	712485993274695680	2016-03-23T03:47:52	kylegriffin1 JWGOP you guys should simply play the entirety of Bratton's remarks repeatedly.
Montel_Williams	712485815188717569	2016-03-23T03:47:10	ZekeJMiller JWGOP pretty weak compared with what Bratton actually said - he's not a political guy. Pretty stunning.
Montel_Williams	712484420465242112	2016-03-23T03:41:37	Always great to talk with NicolleDWallace re: WI, PA, NY, RI, CT, NJ, MD, DE, OR, WS, CA johnkasich territory, no room for fringe Cruz.
Montel_Williams	712484912327032833	2016-03-23T03:43:35	Cruz &amp; allies spent millions in AZ, made several stops (we gave them a free pass)....Squandered! Cruz has no good states after tonight
Montel_Williams	712473973414473728	2016-03-23T03:00:07	Let the Muslims flow in?  Could we be any more bigoted?

Montel_Williams	712471517498507265	2016-03-23T02:50:21	Yes but I see advocating unconstitutional surveillance / corralling of Muslims from Cruz as equally insidious

Montel_Williams	712421990267654145	2016-03-22T23:33:33	I agree with ur statement so too would most Am. Muslims. Cruz statement was not that. 
Montel_Williams	712421698566422528	2016-03-22T23:32:23	The NYPD program "surveilling" the Muslim Comm was shut down - CommissBratton - produced "not one single piece of actionable intel"
Montel_Williams	712419502827315200	2016-03-22T23:23:40	NYPD Commish Bill Bratton, not known for going political, had harsh words for tedcruz - and he's right. Brussels

Montel_Williams	712414808952299520	2016-03-22T23:05:01	Do what I did - Google "Muslims condemn Brussels attack" it's quite telling   
Montel_Williams	712414644313333760	2016-03-22T23:04:21	GregoryCaruso91 and it's important young people, many of whom rightly feel left behind by the party, hear JohnKasich 's message
Montel_Williams	712414407641288705	2016-03-22T23:03:25	Excited to be on board Montel_Williams. It's important that people hear his positive and strong message. Kasich4Us

Montel_Williams	712406722476834816	2016-03-22T22:32:53	Leaders don't scapegoat. Leaders bring us together to reach common goals and fight common enemies.
Montel_Williams	712403525280464896	2016-03-22T22:20:10	Selling point on JohnKasich - He gets we can be VERY TOUGH on jihadism without scapegoating patriotic Muslim Americans...
Montel_Williams	712348662773501952	2016-03-22T18:42:10	JamilesLartey true back then but the military has since been a leader on equality... Bias is not tolerated
Montel_Williams	712336219120623616	2016-03-22T17:52:43	And my guess is we could work hard and cobble together 1% of Christians, or 1% of dog owners who are deranged  
Montel_Williams	712336026815979520	2016-03-22T17:51:58	dontino19 TheSarrrah I think she has a point - the overwhelming % of jihad victims are MUSLIM.
Montel_Williams	712332738850721792	2016-03-22T17:38:54	No we should chase them to the gates of hell while we embrace the MAJORITY of Muslims who also deplore Jihad 
Montel_Williams	712332561637199873	2016-03-22T17:38:11	The notion that American Muslims don't a) deplore jihadism and b) speak out against it denies reality and shows willful ignorance.
Montel_Williams	712332165921382400	2016-03-22T17:36:37	JamilesLartey for sure - I mean I'm not second guessing military decisions on training...
Montel_Williams	712324567637688320	2016-03-22T17:06:25	They do loudly.  
Montel_Williams	712324511979339776	2016-03-22T17:06:12	I find it indicative of the problem we face in this country when people troll a Rabbi from Israel for having an opinion about AIPAC speeches
Montel_Williams	712307069236305920	2016-03-22T15:56:53	The answer isn't to bash Muslims - the answer is to root out JIHADISM - which by the way, American Muslims overwhelmingly support.
Montel_Williams	712306812620374021	2016-03-22T15:55:52	Dear Progressives - radical jihadism is a big problem.  Dear Conservatives - radical jihadis are a microscopic portion of Muslims.
Montel_Williams	712306484747460609	2016-03-22T15:54:34	Kevin_Mackie I think sometimes the use of satire is appropriate when it's patently obvious it's satire
Montel_Williams	712305621958168577	2016-03-22T15:51:08	Directing an outrageous satirical statement to one who makes outrageous satirical statements? Come on now. 
Montel_Williams	712304259832754176	2016-03-22T15:45:44	Satire directed to a satirist! How dare I play her game!  
Montel_Williams	712303487468449792	2016-03-22T15:42:40	AjalaTanya yes but it's a legit question - I'd like to know if our President was snubbed or if this was at our choice.
Montel_Williams	712303333302665216	2016-03-22T15:42:03	Ann you realize they speak Flemmish and Dutch more that French right? Wrong country you dope.

Montel_Williams	712302678420758529	2016-03-22T15:39:27	Dear Conservatives -  world is on freaking fire - don't tweet me about PC in the military - military doesn't need ur help on policy. FOCUS.
Montel_Williams	712302359905304580	2016-03-22T15:38:11	Since the military has no tolerance for racism/bias - they prolly want to save a few court martials / dishonorables  
Montel_Williams	712301541147815936	2016-03-22T15:34:55	I think the military doesn't need civilian help determining how to train marines. MoveOn 
Montel_Williams	712301353771540480	2016-03-22T15:34:11	AjalaTanya it's not petty - take your blinders off - if the President was snubbed that is a big deal.

Montel_Williams	712139391901143040	2016-03-22T04:50:36	For EMP to work, someone would have to get an ICBM with a warhead above us undetected. Good luck with that..

Montel_Williams	712138575203016704	2016-03-22T04:47:21	Exactly! Cyber scares me to death! EMP does not - not because it's not theoretically scary - it's unlikely.

Montel_Williams	712137555248959488	2016-03-22T04:43:18	Which is precisely why it's a theoretical risk - cyber is FAR more likely to take out the grid
