JessGrose	723383020837699585	2016-04-22T05:28:46	Podcast booty call: You up? New ep is here with lennyletter editor JessGrose.  
JessGrose	723259032438476800	2016-04-21T21:16:05	laura_june it's an important perspective, not the only one, nor a particularly relatable one. obvi i am an avid reader/lover of the cut.
JessGrose	723258757770260481	2016-04-21T21:15:00	laura_june There were 3 personal essays -- none by you, btw -- about work/life from freelancers with lots of flexibility + choice in 1 week
JessGrose	723196292399173632	2016-04-21T17:06:47	meghanbarr TheCut Or, you know, dads, even!
JessGrose	723190718538215424	2016-04-21T16:44:38	meghanbarr TheCut But places can use these freelancers or f/t journalists to ASK other people about parenting.
JessGrose	723189029705916416	2016-04-21T16:37:55	I love you TheCut but your motherhood/jobs coverage is getting one note. Talk to someone other than freelance writers about it.

JessGrose	723131444017528832	2016-04-21T12:49:06	sassycurmudgeon Maybe "crunchtacular"
JessGrose	722974772821291008	2016-04-21T02:26:32	Additionally, learning how to edit makes you (or at least made me) a much better writer.

JessGrose	722075741526040578	2016-04-18T14:54:06	Is it a coincidence that the seated subway man who took a look at my pregnant belly and declined to move was reading Updike in hardcover?
JessGrose	721751253596913664	2016-04-17T17:24:43	My half-WASP daughter just asked for a mayonnaise and cheese sandwich and I wonder where I went wrong.
JessGrose	721171904887971840	2016-04-16T03:02:35	therachelweber thank you!! So glad you enjoyed.
JessGrose	721164772067004417	2016-04-16T02:34:14	Soulmates by JessGrose completely sucked me in and still managed to shock me. Add it to your pre-order piles now. 
JessGrose	720783829863108609	2016-04-15T01:20:31	rtraister you just made me feel better about not watching -- for exactly this reason.
JessGrose	720720401987452928	2016-04-14T21:08:28	That there's a new celebrity anti-vax push actually makes me nauseous to think about.

JessGrose	719934674240413698	2016-04-12T17:06:16	Why does it feel like any compliment of Hillary's "preparedness" is *SO* grudgingly given? 
JessGrose	719915658121752576	2016-04-12T15:50:42	Best line in this great jiatolentino about "empowerment": "I love raises and underwear and voting."

JessGrose	719880875446509568	2016-04-12T13:32:30	meghanor I think it's also about having the mindset that other people can take as good care of your baby as you do. I always felt that way.
JessGrose	719879853105942528	2016-04-12T13:28:26	meghanor Yeah that's a big one. For whatever reason I don't have that gene. Having a working mother helped I think?
JessGrose	719879423126806528	2016-04-12T13:26:43	meghanor as in, do you make enough to pay for child care.
JessGrose	719879361134993408	2016-04-12T13:26:29	meghanor yes. Also, as a practical matter, the parenthood vs creativity question is actually just a money question.
JessGrose	719877892507836417	2016-04-12T13:20:38	Re: Parenthood vs Creativity, I went back to work as a writer 6 weeks after my 1st was born and never felt bad. AMA. 
JessGrose	719868841657036801	2016-04-12T12:44:41	yyzgirl lennyletter thanks for the heads up. We will fix for web. We are doing our best but only have 2 full time edit employees.

JessGrose	719675387878346752	2016-04-11T23:55:58	This interview HannaRosin did with her mom about why she's voting for Trump is so illuminating.  1/2

JessGrose	719318704740241408	2016-04-11T00:18:38	First political ad seen in years: Bernie during the Simpsons. Probably a receptive audience.
JessGrose	718982236121509888	2016-04-10T02:01:37	The Invitation is a fucking terrifying, terrific thriller. Highly recommend. Karyn Kusama is a boss.
JessGrose	718850472271089664	2016-04-09T17:18:02	Lovely piece about how much it means to a family when a diner is extra welcoming to a child with special needs: 
JessGrose	718792366421725184	2016-04-09T13:27:09	I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Steve Miller read my piece on the Rock Hall for lennyletter. 
JessGrose	718840579854057472	2016-04-09T16:38:44	jrakoff definitely my longest and most intense relationship.

JessGrose	717707769948844033	2016-04-06T13:37:21	I really loved this essay from KendraJames_ about how fan fiction taught her what sex ed couldn't.

JessGrose	717343203700183041	2016-04-05T13:28:42	JamieStelter lennyletter &lt;3 yay!
JessGrose	717336996495147009	2016-04-05T13:04:02	Pretty psyched to have included the aside "fetuses are stars (just like us)" in today's lennyletter editor's note. 
JessGrose	717327373578928128	2016-04-05T12:25:47	thrashRadical I personally don't give a good goddamn about Gay Talese, I just think expecting him to be a different person is pointless.
JessGrose	717157646621667328	2016-04-05T01:11:21	sullivanamy Full disclosure: The vegetables used were roasted the night before.
JessGrose	717156945824714753	2016-04-05T01:08:34	thrashRadical his wife's an editor, not a writer.
JessGrose	717152381515993088	2016-04-05T00:50:26	I made an entire dinner from scratch during a single episode of Paw Patrol like a goddamn American hero.
JessGrose	717025997049217024	2016-04-04T16:28:14	meghanor ruth_franklin I dunno, I wish there were more literary feuds these days! They're entertaining.

JessGrose	717019751655059456	2016-04-04T16:03:25	Nothing inspires loathing in my crotchety old heart like the phrase "festival season"
JessGrose	717018050424274944	2016-04-04T15:56:39	ruth_franklin true. But I fail to see the solution that would have made his dissenters happy here. That he make up some names to satisfy?
JessGrose	716987334600687617	2016-04-04T13:54:36	I fail to be outraged by the Gay Talese kerfuffle. Is it supposed to be shocking that an 84-year-old man is sexist?
JessGrose	716798781656793089	2016-04-04T01:25:21	frynaomifry I still want to talk about S. 3 of Laguna Beach with LC's sad sister.

JessGrose	715608924318273536	2016-03-31T18:37:17	"Nobody's saying much abt other women running for office"? lennyletter has interviewed Edwards, Harris + Flores 
JessGrose	715608269834862592	2016-03-31T18:34:41	just wanna say i interviewed kamala and donna so 
JessGrose	715574777432449024	2016-03-31T16:21:36	Would read a dating guide by Wendi Deng. 
JessGrose	715286178505822208	2016-03-30T21:14:48	monicaamgwerd right, but everyone has interests and biases, even midwives and doulas
JessGrose	715252327049863169	2016-03-30T19:00:18	does turning it off and on again work to reset the news cycle?
JessGrose	715234639867043840	2016-03-30T17:50:01	monicaamgwerd but yes, as you said--it's not a feminist issue! That's my feeling very deeply.
JessGrose	715234476633120768	2016-03-30T17:49:22	monicaamgwerd I  agree that women should have all the information. I also think there could be lots of ways obstetricians can do better

JessGrose	713379262850420737	2016-03-25T14:57:24	missbumptious I still don't care. I think it's a distraction and it just makes it fair game to talk about for everyone
JessGrose	713379133494005760	2016-03-25T14:56:54	I also don't care about their kids. Chelsea and Ivanka turned out great; Churchill's kids were a fucking disaster. IT DOESN'T MATTER

JessGrose	692720671508553730	2016-01-28T14:47:32	sullivanamy the concern trolling over SSRIs during pregnancy is the MOST infuriating. They do have side effects, but they are literally
JessGrose	692720464767094785	2016-01-28T14:46:43	6) There are still lots of doctors out there who are extremely ignorant about prenatal depression.  
JessGrose	692719884757766144	2016-01-28T14:44:25	sullivanamy yes. at least in my social media all I've seen is THIS IS TROUBLING. It's infuriating. All from other women, too.
JessGrose	692719492875587584	2016-01-28T14:42:51	5) I'm more concerned about all the women who are getting dismissed and suffering, and their families who are suffering along with them.
JessGrose	692719347337465856	2016-01-28T14:42:17	4) Having had prenatal depression, doctors do NOT want to medicate you--they are cautious about it, as they should be.
JessGrose	692719209109913601	2016-01-28T14:41:44	3) To me this is just part of the ongoing stigma against mental illness. You know what else is always screened for in pregnancy? Diabetes.
JessGrose	692718956679958528	2016-01-28T14:40:44	2) Main concerns seem to be either a) women will now be over-medicated; b) employers/government will use the information against women
