JoshMalina	712314587463294976	2016-03-22T16:26:46	Great question. So far it's been pretty darn (sorry!) clean. If the language gets iffy, it'll be marked 'Explicit.' 
JoshMalina	712290609621377024	2016-03-22T14:51:29	Of course. These are disturbingly regular occurrences. People tend to notice the victims that look like themselves.
