sepinwall	713108022818680836	2016-03-24T20:59:36	Yup. HBO didn't own its earliest shows, and streaming rights weren't a thing to be negotiated in the '90s. 
sepinwall	713105913582919680	2016-03-24T20:51:13	There's no free streaming option for "Larry Sanders" at the moment, but at $20, the series DVD is an insane bargain. 
sepinwall	713100138055647234	2016-03-24T20:28:16	Here's a great mattzollerseitz essay on the genius of "Larry Sanders" 
sepinwall	713099949429428224	2016-03-24T20:27:31	I'll be poring over "Larry Sanders" clips for a while, but in the meantime, here's Shandling cracking up Bill  RIP
sepinwall	713099428584939520	2016-03-24T20:25:27	Garry Shandling died? At 66? Just awful. "The Larry Sanders Show" and "It's Garry Shandling's Show" are both classics.
sepinwall	713098194280964097	2016-03-24T20:20:32	I talked a lot about "Daredevil" s2 with RothCornet  
sepinwall	713021342996643840	2016-03-24T15:15:10	'Nashville' is about to do something VERY strange behind the scenes

sepinwall	713019065594458112	2016-03-24T15:06:07	fakeninjitsu This is my point. Best shows find a happy medium. Netflix shows often abandon episodic structure entirely, to their detriment.
sepinwall	713017591070113792	2016-03-24T15:00:15	fakeninjitsu Hannibal and The Shield both did a LOT of episodic storytelling, even though they were heavily serialized.

sepinwall	713009859436929024	2016-03-24T14:29:32	Josh_Friedman tvoti Yup. The exception to every rule. But I think they've been very influential on shows that can't do it as well.

sepinwall	713002581421854721	2016-03-24T14:00:37	Based on the first few episodes, it's not happening. More or less the same show Fey and Carlock made for NBC.

sepinwall	712999339728175104	2016-03-24T13:47:44	Yup. Episodic storytelling is your friend, even on a heavily-serialized show:

sepinwall	712770171706941444	2016-03-23T22:37:06	This is very strange, and one of the few things that might get me to watch Nashville for the first time since s1.

sepinwall	712639106178752512	2016-03-23T13:56:17	Yup. Murder of the week stories are hit or miss, but great characterization and dialogue, and lots of fun overall.

sepinwall	701434507862405121	2016-02-21T15:53:13	He was afraid max salaries would shrink in new CBA. Wanted to get paid while he could, no matter what NY gave up.  
sepinwall	701432525441216513	2016-02-21T15:45:20	jasonrmcintyre Melo's a great player, but this partnership has been doomed from the start.
sepinwall	701430212622417920	2016-02-21T15:36:09	Melo's arrival left the roster crippled. Knick management then did a bad job working with the remaining assets.
sepinwall	701430010163417088	2016-02-21T15:35:21	Both sides deserve blame. Starting w/Melo forcing trade to NY &amp; not waiting for FA because he was afraid of new CBA. 
sepinwall	701426270819717120	2016-02-21T15:20:29	Books_Not_Wooks Which is why I say both sides share blame. Melo crippled roster. Management wasn't good enough to uncripple it.
sepinwall	701423740765212672	2016-02-21T15:10:26	Books_Not_Wooks He could have waited to be a FA, but was afraid of new CBA restricting salaries. Forced a trade that NYK still pays for.
sepinwall	701422826826440705	2016-02-21T15:06:48	Books_Not_Wooks It's a mix of both. Melo has prioritized making the most $ possible, which is his right, but at cost of team building.

sepinwall	691998725649125376	2016-01-26T14:58:47	Because I'm often enthusiastic about things, people assume I'm always supposed to be enthusiastic.  
sepinwall	691996999168688128	2016-01-26T14:51:55	Modern Family the most surprising instance of this. You expect it from fans of cult and/or scifi/fantasy shows, but a mainstream sitcom?

sepinwall	691456660922077184	2016-01-25T03:04:49	My guess is earliest X-Files starts is 10:20. But we'll see.

sepinwall	691453607871381504	2016-01-25T02:52:41	X-Files will definitely start late, even if there wasn't a postgame show. Given that, I wonder how long Fox lets postgame run.

sepinwall	690672132615991296	2016-01-22T23:07:23	Perhaps they have. Though even Moffat had started softening on that near the end.  
sepinwall	690671567077011456	2016-01-22T23:05:08	Sure. Nearly all of my favorite modern eps were either written by Moffat or came during his tenure as showrunner.  
sepinwall	690671332590247936	2016-01-22T23:04:12	Also, will be weird to only have a Doctor Who Christmas special in 2016, and no other eps
