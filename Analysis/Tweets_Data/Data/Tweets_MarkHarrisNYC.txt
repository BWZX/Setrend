MarkHarrisNYC	693915665355399168	2016-01-31T21:56:01	World of Tomorrow is on Netflix; it's a brilliant combo of melancholy short story, dystopian sci-fi, sick joke, existential howl &amp; sad poem.

MarkHarrisNYC	691126516470693888	2016-01-24T05:12:56	kristapley HighSierraMan Early predix reinforce that--the narrative becomes "I thought X, but that was before I saw Y!" every 3 weeks.
MarkHarrisNYC	691124747938177024	2016-01-24T05:05:55	kristapley HighSierraMan Because nobody's seen this year's movies!
MarkHarrisNYC	691123731394072576	2016-01-24T05:01:52	joshuarolson I think these changes will at least mean that more voters will watch some of the films that ARE greenlit. But we may disagree.
MarkHarrisNYC	691122151865344000	2016-01-24T04:55:36	kristapley HighSierraMan That, on the basis of some of this year's nominations, is debatable. And Jan. predictions are clickbait nonsense.
MarkHarrisNYC	691121366062465024	2016-01-24T04:52:28	ChrisNashawaty I encourage everyone to praise it copiously! Which can be done without the word "Oscar."
MarkHarrisNYC	691120137936728064	2016-01-24T04:47:35	ChrisNashawaty I'm talking about people who look for what they think are "Academy movies" in order to make early guesses, not critics.
MarkHarrisNYC	691119851641950208	2016-01-24T04:46:27	kristapley HighSierraMan In what way?
MarkHarrisNYC	691119297888960512	2016-01-24T04:44:15	ChrisNashawaty early. So later, a worthy diverse movie gets tagged a "long shot" that cd "upset" the "favorites." Reinforces a bad system.
MarkHarrisNYC	691118717623754752	2016-01-24T04:41:57	ChrisNashawaty Not my intention. But movies w/ POC tend to be off the radar of movie journalists, so white movies get tagged "locks" &gt;&gt;
MarkHarrisNYC	691116234121859072	2016-01-24T04:32:05	joshuarolson But AMPAS is supposed to embody the best of the industry, not reflect its failings.
MarkHarrisNYC	691109203969179650	2016-01-24T04:04:09	KateAurthur Well, this year of all years...
MarkHarrisNYC	691105733199466496	2016-01-24T03:50:21	Maybe press could help the cause of a diverse Oscar field by not starting to assign next year's slots to white people in f---ing JANUARY?
MarkHarrisNYC	691096034727043072	2016-01-24T03:11:49	Not sure if I'm doing it yet, but this has all made me think that next Oscar season will be a news-rich one for journalists to cover.
MarkHarrisNYC	691064975759183872	2016-01-24T01:08:24	I do have sympathy for AMPAS members upset that they can no longer vote. But a decision that hurts some feelings can still be the right one.
MarkHarrisNYC	691064050818617344	2016-01-24T01:04:43	ALSO odd to hear "This should only be about excellence," as if "excellence" has nothing to do with who gets to define excellence.
MarkHarrisNYC	691063654431727616	2016-01-24T01:03:09	Also odd to see people complain that entry standards will now be lower, after decades of "I got in bc I know someone who looks like me."
MarkHarrisNYC	691063304291229696	2016-01-24T01:01:45	Odd to see people complain that AMPAS rule changes are an attempt to skew the vote going forward. The vote has been skewed for decades.
MarkHarrisNYC	691061393328623616	2016-01-24T00:54:10	ScottHolleran PhyllisNagy Throw something less idiotic than "Now wins won't mean anything!" at me and we'll see.
MarkHarrisNYC	691059105960693761	2016-01-24T00:45:04	joshuarolson Lexialex AMPAS issues can't all be explained by "We just reflect the industry."It matters who's judging those diverse films.
MarkHarrisNYC	691058232081715204	2016-01-24T00:41:36	joshuarolson Lexialex I agree re ageism. But "inactive"-ism, w/ these loopholes, feels fair. &amp;AMPAS can only fix itself, not the industry.
MarkHarrisNYC	691056105020071936	2016-01-24T00:33:09	Nothing out of Sundance will make me happier than reading rave tweets for Kenneth Lonergan's new movie. Cannot wait to see it.
MarkHarrisNYC	691045812156112896	2016-01-23T23:52:15	Thinking of yesterday when I said "...and let's pick up a chocolate cake for the blizzard!" and we both said "HAHAHA" and didn't. Weeping.
MarkHarrisNYC	691036903651610624	2016-01-23T23:16:51	Seizing a moment? Universal mailed this wraparound trade ad for Straight Outta Compton to SAG voters this week. 
MarkHarrisNYC	691020791253766144	2016-01-23T22:12:49	cinementalist Yeah, this is the "I marched in Selma and then 'they' turned on me" complaint. I wish I could say it shocked me.

MarkHarrisNYC	690989248850321408	2016-01-23T20:07:29	These quotes from AMPAS voters who hate the new rules mostly reaffirm my belief that the new rules are essential. 
MarkHarrisNYC	690975825064235010	2016-01-23T19:14:09	Pretty much ready to unfollow, mute or block anyone who attempts to equate diversity with lowering of standards. Go away &amp; learn something.

MarkHarrisNYC	690958197167882245	2016-01-23T18:04:06	Man on local news: "I'm staying in because of the snow and whatnot." Really, the snow itself is a fine reason. You don't need a second one.
MarkHarrisNYC	690956260410261504	2016-01-23T17:56:24	One thing I hope we all learned from all the actors speaking extemporaneously about the Oscars this week: Writers are important.
MarkHarrisNYC	690914200386936832	2016-01-23T15:09:16	Happens at Sundance, means nothing for a film's future: People walk out People cry People cheer People boo People think it could be HUGE
MarkHarrisNYC	690906579290439680	2016-01-23T14:38:59	I went out in the snow. It was super cold and I had to be out there for a while because I needed to get food. Can I have a Best Actor Oscar?
MarkHarrisNYC	690761522134552576	2016-01-23T05:02:35	DanRiffle Agree focus should be on the industry as well as (not instead of) AMPAS. But AMPAS's mission isn't to mirror industry stats.
MarkHarrisNYC	690753718799732738	2016-01-23T04:31:34	The impulse of some people to keep talking astounds me. 
MarkHarrisNYC	690745675303239680	2016-01-23T03:59:37	If you want to know why these changes were essential, it's bc that kind of delusional farewell-to-our-standards thinking is all too common.
MarkHarrisNYC	690745276257189889	2016-01-23T03:58:01	An AMPAS member just emailed me, "There will be an asterisk on all winners from now on." No answer to that idiocy except to make it public.
MarkHarrisNYC	690733428023676928	2016-01-23T03:10:57	Watching American Crime (which is very interesting) and was delighted and surprised to see the credit "Directed by Gregg Araki"!
MarkHarrisNYC	690726065099137024	2016-01-23T02:41:41	BornOnFeb14 Thanks so much--I hope you enjoy it!
MarkHarrisNYC	690723624228093952	2016-01-23T02:31:59	Good AMPAS story by ThatRebecca with some illuminating numbers. (Note the 2nd, 3rd &amp; 4th biggest Oscar branches!) 
MarkHarrisNYC	690716071909838848	2016-01-23T02:01:59	steph_bello If Grantland still existed, this week, I would have.
MarkHarrisNYC	690700022359420928	2016-01-23T00:58:12	DavidPoland Incorrect. All 3 decisions were made to put Oscar votes more firmly in the hands of people actively involved in making movies.
MarkHarrisNYC	690687152187916289	2016-01-23T00:07:04	Both moves created hurt feelings. And both were the right things to do to keep AMPAS vital as an institution. As is what AMPAS did today.
MarkHarrisNYC	690686703410003968	2016-01-23T00:05:17	In the '70s lots of rank-and-file studio employees were purged so that bloc voting for things like Towering Inferno as Best Pic would stop.&gt;
MarkHarrisNYC	690686448782151680	2016-01-23T00:04:16	Some AMPAS history: In the 1940s the Academy reduced its membership hugely by kicking out 1000s of extras--to make better choices. &gt;&gt;&gt;
MarkHarrisNYC	690682926195957760	2016-01-22T23:50:16	Wesley_Morris I doubt it, bc the voters mostly likely to seek out/support a fringe film might be the most appalled by what she said.
MarkHarrisNYC	690682453430833152	2016-01-22T23:48:23	kristapley So, if, say, you started work in 1960, got invited to join in 1985, and retired in 1990...do you still get to vote or not?
MarkHarrisNYC	690680890536677376	2016-01-22T23:42:11	kristapley But is that 30 years total, or 30 years after they became members (which is what it will be for new members)? Do we know?
MarkHarrisNYC	690680386955911168	2016-01-22T23:40:11	Which is actually great, because their taste was so widely acknowledged as dicey that the Academy itself created ways to compensate for it.
MarkHarrisNYC	690680124463800322	2016-01-22T23:39:08	One side effect of new AMPAS rules: The foreign-film selection process, which relied heavily on inactives/retirees, may have to change.
MarkHarrisNYC	690675279270785024	2016-01-22T23:19:53	From an academy official: 'By doubling, our hope is that women will comprise 48% and diverse groups more than 14% of our total membership.'
MarkHarrisNYC	690674019138420736	2016-01-22T23:14:52	First Rampling, now Julie Delpy? Next we'll get a press release from Emmanuelle Riva saying Eazy-E had it coming.
MarkHarrisNYC	690670603074936833	2016-01-22T23:01:18	DavidPoland FerdyOnFilms Numbers are slightly off here. Women are currently at about 25% per LATimes.
MarkHarrisNYC	690669924583350273	2016-01-22T22:58:36	DavidPoland Screaming didn't make it move, appropriate anger &amp; distress did. And yes, it moved. We disagree on this. Let's leave it there.
MarkHarrisNYC	690669261493256192	2016-01-22T22:55:58	&gt;&gt; does applying it retroactively mean any voter who was active 30 yrs is safe, or just those who were active for 30 yrs after they joined?
MarkHarrisNYC	690668893086556160	2016-01-22T22:54:30	One thing TheAcademy should clarify: New members must be active in three consec 10-yr periods AFTER joining to have lifetime status. But &gt;&gt;
MarkHarrisNYC	690666620142751746	2016-01-22T22:45:28	DavidPoland Gale Anne Hurd was executive producer of Very Good Girls (2013). Please remove her from your list of martyrs.
MarkHarrisNYC	690649690568667137	2016-01-22T21:38:12	Maybe TheAcademy could also allow those retired members to keep their voting status if they volunteered in a diversity mentorship program?
MarkHarrisNYC	690659878675812352	2016-01-22T22:18:41	MarkHarrisNYC AMPAS members today: ~1150 women, ~300 nonwhite. Double would be some combo equaling 2,900.
MarkHarrisNYC	690658613543747584	2016-01-22T22:13:39	P.S. To anyone tweeting at me either "PC runs amok!" or "Not good enough!": Go scream at each other, please. Non-screaming won today.
MarkHarrisNYC	690657474228133889	2016-01-22T22:09:08	kateyrich I think execs who left the biz long ago and are now in real estate are more common than actors who worked for &lt;30 yrs &amp; stopped.
MarkHarrisNYC	690656654514348034	2016-01-22T22:05:52	Here's TheAcademy release.  And thanks to all of you who listened to me go on about this issue all week.
MarkHarrisNYC	690656169107558400	2016-01-22T22:03:57	Now it's our job in the press to A) hold AMPAS to it and B) hold ourselves to the need to cover this year-round throughout the industry.
MarkHarrisNYC	690655709298626561	2016-01-22T22:02:07	The Academy has many members who don't get it--as we heard this week! Thankfully, they've now proved that they have many who DO get it.
MarkHarrisNYC	690655392905428995	2016-01-22T22:00:52	Perfect circumstances are not required for a critically important issue to come to a head. It happens because it has to. This had to happen.
MarkHarrisNYC	690655141498847232	2016-01-22T21:59:52	the Actors Branch isn't the big problem (also true), we should focus on the industry (also true). But the thing is, that doesn't matter. &gt;&gt;
MarkHarrisNYC	690654863236206592	2016-01-22T21:58:45	I've heard from some people that the Academy is overreacting. All the non-nominated movies this year were close calls (probably true)...&gt;&gt;
MarkHarrisNYC	690654625993723908	2016-01-22T21:57:49	3) Getting new members committed to these issues onto the Board is big. You have to be in the room where the decisions get made.
MarkHarrisNYC	690654346875371520	2016-01-22T21:56:42	2) Moving inactive members to nonvoting status (w/ many loopholes) will affect non-creatives more than others. A fair, non-ageist solution.
MarkHarrisNYC	690653806984568832	2016-01-22T21:54:33	1) Doubling the number of women and minority members is a huge and concrete numerical goal, and four years is an aggressive timetable.
MarkHarrisNYC	690653592714395648	2016-01-22T21:53:42	Here are the pro-diversity changes announced by TheAcademy today. I think these are mostly excellent and to the point. Here's why:
MarkHarrisNYC	690623482774851584	2016-01-22T19:54:04	"Thundersnow" is a thing? Whatever. I'm sure the Flash can defeat it.
MarkHarrisNYC	690603451345141760	2016-01-22T18:34:28	...but instead he pandered to people who want to believe in easy declarations and magic solutions. That is politics-as-usual to its marrow.
MarkHarrisNYC	690603009924030464	2016-01-22T18:32:43	If Sanders had said, "I will make overturning Citizens United a litmus test for Supreme Court appointments," that would be one thing...
MarkHarrisNYC	690598453517357056	2016-01-22T18:14:36	Interesting. Explain. RTBernieSanders Any Supreme Court nominee of mine will make overturning Citizens United one of their first decisions.
MarkHarrisNYC	690596927889620996	2016-01-22T18:08:32	jmcgvrn Breznican andrecole The more stupid, thoughtless (or worse) statements come out before Tuesday's meeting, the better.
MarkHarrisNYC	690596247338684416	2016-01-22T18:05:50	Don't try to engineer a result; fix the process &amp; the personnel. Arguing that 5 slots aren't enough to accommodate POC is patronizing.
MarkHarrisNYC	690595502040162304	2016-01-22T18:02:52	If you say, "This store catalog features only white people," the answer isn't, "OK, we'll add pages and then black people might get in." &gt;&gt;
MarkHarrisNYC	690595276399198208	2016-01-22T18:01:59	Re AMPAS and diversity: The reason that adding nominee slots is a bad idea is that it is fundamentally non-responsive. &gt;&gt;
MarkHarrisNYC	690584583365091328	2016-01-22T17:19:29	steph_bello Well, Dustin Hoffman, 78, was just quoted as deploring AMPAS's systemic racism, so let's not paint them all with one brush.
MarkHarrisNYC	690569026184028160	2016-01-22T16:17:40	I can say, as an Oscar historian, how rare this is. AMPAS is now at a truly pivotal moment. It addresses this credibly, or it begins to die.
MarkHarrisNYC	690565680211558402	2016-01-22T16:04:22	All week I've said ageism is no solution to AMPAS's problems. It'd be nice if at least 1 old voter said something non-stupid to back me up.
MarkHarrisNYC	690563454420258818	2016-01-22T15:55:32	Reese Witherspoon on Academy diversity. (Don't worry--this WON'T make you want to punch something.) 
MarkHarrisNYC	690558060071288832	2016-01-22T15:34:06	Charlotte Rampling is an academy member, MarkHarrisNYC. And I can tell you many other members publicly share her sentiments. Stay tuned.
MarkHarrisNYC	690557963921182721	2016-01-22T15:33:43	TimothyL_ No surprise at all with him.
MarkHarrisNYC	690557373585440768	2016-01-22T15:31:22	mimbale @Ryan_Man2 Yes, that's right--and that round of voting has not started yet.
MarkHarrisNYC	690555581468426240	2016-01-22T15:24:15	What you can extrapolate about AMPAS attitudes from Charlotte Rampling's comments: Nothing. Reporting I haven't seen: Is she IN the Academy?
MarkHarrisNYC	690406110004666370	2016-01-22T05:30:18	"Do I really have to say all this stuff?" --every actor on DC's Legends of Tomorrow, I imagine
MarkHarrisNYC	690376741358059520	2016-01-22T03:33:36	eddie2003PRT For actors? No. 5 is a great tradtion, and until last year, it'd been trending towards inclusivity--more than other branches.
MarkHarrisNYC	690376073071169536	2016-01-22T03:30:57	DaveCullen Think they've gone from 5700 to 6200 in the last few years. I could see them going to 7500-8000 over the next decade. Why not?
MarkHarrisNYC	690374813202907136	2016-01-22T03:25:56	with branches that do not comply being forbidden to add new members until they do. That's it. Sorry for the tweetstorm!
MarkHarrisNYC	690374515642253312	2016-01-22T03:24:45	DaveCullen So, tons of unanswerables. My "solution" is an overall expansion of membership &amp; yearslong mandated diversity in ALL branches &gt;&gt;
MarkHarrisNYC	690374250646106115	2016-01-22T03:23:42	DaveCullen And the Actors branch, now the focus of rage, was the MOST inclusive branch (re: nominees) for the decade before 2014. &gt;&gt;
MarkHarrisNYC	690373973436137472	2016-01-22T03:22:36	&gt;&gt; I think overwhelmingly white/male (but not esp. old) branches like Sound, Executive, and VFX are more to blame. We'll never know. &gt;&gt;
MarkHarrisNYC	690373676919865345	2016-01-22T03:21:25	DaveCullen Here's the thing: We have no data on how taste breaks down demographically, &amp; we'll never get it. You see age as a culprit... &gt;&gt;
MarkHarrisNYC	690370811027460100	2016-01-22T03:10:02	DaveCullen I agree with that 100% and have been tweeting about it all week. It can be achieved without silencing existing voters.
MarkHarrisNYC	690370529015025665	2016-01-22T03:08:55	DaveCullen Yeah. And that sucks. But you can't use a demographic trait to mute a group of people whose taste you suspect you don't like.
MarkHarrisNYC	690369189975060480	2016-01-22T03:03:35	DaveCullen Unfair in what way? Ewww, your gross old taste is getting in the way of the pure expression of my great young taste?
MarkHarrisNYC	690367984565641216	2016-01-22T02:58:48	DaveCullen Yes! It's an institution designed to recognize achievement, not to offer a perfect demographic cross-section of the industry.
MarkHarrisNYC	690367510290546691	2016-01-22T02:56:55	DaveCullen That is...not a model I would necessarily emulate. I think there are better, non-exclusionary, longer-term ways to solve this.
MarkHarrisNYC	690366596297129985	2016-01-22T02:53:17	DaveCullen Since women and people of color have a harder time staying employed in Hwood long-term, that's a bad quick fix.
MarkHarrisNYC	690365700012118016	2016-01-22T02:49:43	DaveCullen An institution devoted to rewarding a range of creative achievement cannot say "If you're this old, your taste doesn't count."

MarkHarrisNYC	689666277971992577	2016-01-20T04:30:28	Where to begin? 
MarkHarrisNYC	689655733395312640	2016-01-20T03:48:34	Ted Cruz watches Sarah Palin endorse Donald Trump. 
MarkHarrisNYC	689603360379572225	2016-01-20T00:20:27	CarrieRickey I really believe huge changes can be accomplished without penalizing a single current member.
MarkHarrisNYC	689602521669713920	2016-01-20T00:17:08	Okay, that's it for now. Thanks for bearing with me as I try to puzzle my way through an issue that fascinates me.
MarkHarrisNYC	689602267377487872	2016-01-20T00:16:07	So maybe AMPAS should consider a cross-branch taskforce tilted toward newer members who get why it matters. I believe there are many.
MarkHarrisNYC	689601884315873281	2016-01-20T00:14:36	That happens when "diversity" us treated as a box you just gotta check off somehow. Doesn't matter which group gets shafted if ONE doesn't.
MarkHarrisNYC	689601470598123520	2016-01-20T00:12:57	4) Looking at the lists, it's easy to imagine a branch saying, yeah, no black people, but look at how many women! Or, we found 3 Asians!
MarkHarrisNYC	689601253484134400	2016-01-20T00:12:05	...a majority of Writing invitees last year were POC. Great! But in 2014, 18 of 19 were white. Nobody gets to take a year off from this.
MarkHarrisNYC	689600779049680898	2016-01-20T00:10:12	3) Many individual branches will make a big diversity push once, maybe either to atone or so they can let it go next year. For instance...
MarkHarrisNYC	689600028558692352	2016-01-20T00:07:13	...that fight may need to move elsewhere (and maybe those branches need fewer new members for a while).
MarkHarrisNYC	689599815412551681	2016-01-20T00:06:22	2) There are a few branches--sound, cinematography--in which AMPAS non-diversity is so clearly reflective of industry non-diversity that...
MarkHarrisNYC	689599422536237056	2016-01-20T00:04:49	1) About 30% of members joined in 2004 or later. That is a substantial, largely young-middle-aged group many of whom care about this issue.
MarkHarrisNYC	689599105052626945	2016-01-20T00:03:33	A few more thoughts on AMPAS and diversity that came up as I looked over the last 12 years of invitees...
MarkHarrisNYC	689563600764194816	2016-01-19T21:42:28	csittenfeld It is a truth universally acknowledged.
MarkHarrisNYC	689553301906558976	2016-01-19T21:01:33	moe67 I don't, sorry! It's a mix of recent nominees, many young, and longtime actors. Probably younger overall than many people imagine.
MarkHarrisNYC	689552589181050881	2016-01-19T20:58:43	SamuelAAdams I am really sorry to see this go. You've done great work.
MarkHarrisNYC	689551189432729601	2016-01-19T20:53:09	cracksback No...and a couple of people have died. But I think most people accept the invitations so the numbers probably wouldn't move much
MarkHarrisNYC	689550757050343425	2016-01-19T20:51:26	AMPAS's overall invitation lists are easily searchable back to at least 2004. I hope someone takes a stab at a larger statistical portrait.
MarkHarrisNYC	689549986397339648	2016-01-19T20:48:22	Incidentally, invitation lists are compiled by the various AMPAS branches, each of which has its own membership committee.
MarkHarrisNYC	689549309965160449	2016-01-19T20:45:41	Which means it's quite proper for AMPAS to "over"invite actors of color, just as they "over"invited white actors, until they get it right.
MarkHarrisNYC	689548777913475072	2016-01-19T20:43:34	But you don't fix decades of imbalance by saying, "Well, NOW we're getting it right." You work to get the OVERALL membership proportional.&gt;
MarkHarrisNYC	689548342364344320	2016-01-19T20:41:50	Some people are noting that African-Americans are about 12% of the US population as a way of saying AMPAS's recent numbers are about right.&gt;
MarkHarrisNYC	689544607605100544	2016-01-19T20:27:00	Since 2008, 7 Asian actors, 12 Latino actors, &amp; 5 other non-black minority actors have also been invited to join.
MarkHarrisNYC	689543380158775296	2016-01-19T20:22:07	So any notion that a massive diversity push is substantially changing AMPAS is false. Isaacs is right; progress is too slow.
MarkHarrisNYC	689542616661278720	2016-01-19T20:19:05	Black actors invited to join in the last 8 yrs total just 2% of the branch's membership. If that's progress, it's progress by millimeters.
MarkHarrisNYC	689541586099789824	2016-01-19T20:14:59	If AMPAS wonders why diversity efforts haven't helped, it may be bc they haven't been made. 21 black actors in eight years isn't enough.
MarkHarrisNYC	689540945533083648	2016-01-19T20:12:27	And in terms of gender representation, the Actors branch has actually moved backward. 57% of 2008-11 invitees were male: 61% since then.
MarkHarrisNYC	689540701059694592	2016-01-19T20:11:28	However, the percentage of black actors invited in has barely moved. They represented 12% of the 2008-11 total and 14% of the 2012-15 total.
MarkHarrisNYC	689540107808985088	2016-01-19T20:09:07	From 2008-11, the actors invited 74 members to join; from 2012-15 they invited 92. 2008-11: 80% of the invitees were white. 2012-15: 67%.
MarkHarrisNYC	689539545541525505	2016-01-19T20:06:53	The diversity push in AMPAS started 4 years ago, when each branch began to invite many more members. That included the Actors Branch.
MarkHarrisNYC	689539166355484673	2016-01-19T20:05:22	I'm going to tweet out some interesting stats I just researched about diversity and the actors' branch of theAcademy. Mute if you're bored.

MarkHarrisNYC	688029707074428929	2016-01-15T16:07:19	AndrewLapin In an ideal world, yes. But the noise and volume of campaigns makes it hard for voters to think apart from them.
MarkHarrisNYC	688028954196860930	2016-01-15T16:04:20	But of course, I'd be eager to hear any better suggestions.
MarkHarrisNYC	688028763368587267	2016-01-15T16:03:34	I question whether AMPAS can do anything but what it's doing: A sustained and wholly transparent years-long push to diversify its ranks.
MarkHarrisNYC	688027629333671936	2016-01-15T15:59:04	So while I think OscarsSoWhite shines a useful light on a larger issue, I'll just note that the Oscars are not what primarily need fixing.

MarkHarrisNYC	688027060435054598	2016-01-15T15:56:48	The problem w/ "The Academy's racist" is that it treats it as an institution that can be lobbied in some way. It isn't. It's just voters...
MarkHarrisNYC	688025937951211522	2016-01-15T15:52:21	Compton was campaigned early, but Jason Mitchell needed more of a massive, separate push than he got. Creed needed MUCH more.
MarkHarrisNYC	688025441878306816	2016-01-15T15:50:22	...that Creed and Compton were recognized as campaignable too late by their studios. That hurt. Commitment to a movie has to come early.
MarkHarrisNYC	688025140765036546	2016-01-15T15:49:11	..."When will AMPAS ever catch up to the world?" is also inaccurate. In many years, it's been AHEAD of H'wood. An alternative I'd suggest is
MarkHarrisNYC	688024733435166720	2016-01-15T15:47:33	These last 2 years can't be rationalized with "Every omission is a special case." There's a AMPAS problem and an industry problem. But...
MarkHarrisNYC	688024210019581953	2016-01-15T15:45:29	Toward the end of that decade, the Academy began its push to diversify its membership. So the % of minority voters is now higher.
MarkHarrisNYC	688023869207261184	2016-01-15T15:44:07	The decade in which 24 black actors were nominated also included seven wins, so there was clearly nothing grudging about those inclusions.
MarkHarrisNYC	688023083798626306	2016-01-15T15:41:00	That period followed the historic year in which Denzel Washington and Halle Berry won the two top prizes and seemed to confirm a change.
MarkHarrisNYC	688022820568313856	2016-01-15T15:39:57	In the 10 years pre-cold streak, AMPAS nominated 24 black actors and actresses. It only blanked 1 year. In '05 &amp; '07, FIVE were nominated.
MarkHarrisNYC	688022243205578752	2016-01-15T15:37:40	Yesterday I went after the Academy for its all-white slate. Today I want to make the case, briefly, that the last 2 years are an anomaly.
MarkHarrisNYC	687870751186251780	2016-01-15T05:35:41	SAG and WGA each matched about 60% of the Oscar nominees. PGA and DGA missed Room. So "precursors" only tell you the easy stuff.
MarkHarrisNYC	687859161644662784	2016-01-15T04:49:38	To end nomination day, here's a really good overview from JustinCChang.

MarkHarrisNYC	687821661605883904	2016-01-15T02:20:37	Do people often get elected President by bellowing about how the world is terrible and everything has gone to shit?
MarkHarrisNYC	687818137580994561	2016-01-15T02:06:37	Please, please nominate this smug, pious wad for President. Do it.
MarkHarrisNYC	687764722607759360	2016-01-14T22:34:22	MarkHarrisNYC good point but cool that all 5 actresses were in fact a lead character &amp; not just wife of the lead as can often happen.
MarkHarrisNYC	687755840741355521	2016-01-14T21:59:04	DavidPoland BilgeEbiri I mean, not to name names, but the idiots and deadwood in the Academy didn't join in the last 6-8 years.
MarkHarrisNYC	687755541913964544	2016-01-14T21:57:53	DavidPoland BilgeEbiri I'd argue there's more rigorous quality control even as membership expands than there was in clubby earlier years.

MarkHarrisNYC	687753220987424770	2016-01-14T21:48:40	DavidPoland BilgeEbiri Lingering and brooding on criticism is the opposite of hating it. And I don't feel they've lowered the bar at all.
MarkHarrisNYC	687749113287438337	2016-01-14T21:32:21	DavidPoland BilgeEbiri I don't think they hate criticism. Nobody loves it but they've responded well &amp; openly on many issues, inc. this 1.
MarkHarrisNYC	687746030931197952	2016-01-14T21:20:06	Last Oscar thing (for now): Best early call I heard was from adambvary, who said Stallone was a contender way before Creed hit the radar.
MarkHarrisNYC	687745400439181312	2016-01-14T21:17:35	DavidPoland BilgeEbiri So we can't discuss racism unless all other possibilities have been eliminated? Bad standard. Okay, butting out.
MarkHarrisNYC	687743249499422721	2016-01-14T21:09:02	AS I WAS SAYING!

MarkHarrisNYC	687654878227881985	2016-01-14T15:17:53	I'm seeing "institutional racism/homophobia" a lot. But bad demographics is more the issue. AMPAS isn't like a corp. w/ internal culture.

MarkHarrisNYC	687641635308597248	2016-01-14T14:25:16	Last thing on this point: This is an Oscar problem ONLY as a reflection of an industry problem. The nominations change when the films do,&gt;&gt;
MarkHarrisNYC	687641002891415552	2016-01-14T14:22:45	That's changing, as the membership changes. A good year can disguise the fact that they have a way to go. A year like this lays it bare.&gt;&gt;
MarkHarrisNYC	687640342867349504	2016-01-14T14:20:08	The older, white, male votership doesn't hate women, gays, black people. They're just not as interested in their/our stories.&gt;&gt;
MarkHarrisNYC	687639950305701888	2016-01-14T14:18:34	Re other omissions: It's not inappropriate to discuss racism, sexism, and homophobia. But those labels are blunt; what happens is soft.&gt;&gt;
MarkHarrisNYC	687639176540454912	2016-01-14T14:15:30	Possible explanation for Ridley Scott's omission: I think some directors see The Martian as more produced than directed.
MarkHarrisNYC	687634735200382976	2016-01-14T13:57:51	I think the writers and cinematographers branches did their jobs this year. And I think the actors mostly did what they were told.
MarkHarrisNYC	687634013192876033	2016-01-14T13:54:59	Which movies come out of today stronger in the contest: The Big Short, Revenant, and Room, which will now get seen by a lot more people.

MarkHarrisNYC	687632400210374659	2016-01-14T13:48:34	Most shocking omissions came from the writers: No Sorkin, no Tarantino. Most shocking (and welcome) inclusion: Lenny Abrahamson for Room.
MarkHarrisNYC	687632116553744384	2016-01-14T13:47:26	Big disappointments for me in the nominations: Zero independent thinking from the actors branch; all-white lineup; Carol/Haynes yawned at.
