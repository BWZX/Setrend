PCollinsTimes	719174924875796481	2016-04-10T14:47:18	I have in fact done so. Here it is. You'll see I want to shift taxation, not add to it.  
PCollinsTimes	719174254860890112	2016-04-10T14:44:38	ninjamoose101 You can say that about all tax. I agree. If we needed no money I would happily make all tax zero.

PCollinsTimes	719172837827878912	2016-04-10T14:39:00	arawtani LongShortTrader I don't.

PCollinsTimes	719172255486500864	2016-04-10T14:36:41	SirJenkinson That is true of all tax so not a point. We have to tax something. I think we tax labour too heavily.
PCollinsTimes	719171642971267072	2016-04-10T14:34:15	andrew_lilico mattforde No. My distinction is Asquith's. Tax unearned not earned, wealth not income. I haven't earned my house price rise
PCollinsTimes	719170728235573249	2016-04-10T14:30:37	andrew_lilico mattforde As a rule taxing wealth rather than income is preferable, yes. I don't relish either but given we need the money

PCollinsTimes	719166529984708608	2016-04-10T14:13:56	I would reduce income tax to compensate. I want tax to be fairer, not heavier.
PCollinsTimes	719166413752115201	2016-04-10T14:13:29	OK, maybe not 100%. But gifts during lifetime should be taxed as least as heavily as earned income. I would say more heavily.
PCollinsTimes	719166272928354304	2016-04-10T14:12:55	The tax should be on the recipient who has not been taxed and has not earned the gift (just to keep you all boiling).

PCollinsTimes	701110063528857602	2016-02-20T18:23:59	gilescoren The whole debate will be conducted in these terms. It's EU law that says it has to be.

PCollinsTimes	701107897510584320	2016-02-20T18:15:23	Which means the real debate is incommensurate. A series of projected material benefits (In) against a valued abstraction (Out). 2/2
PCollinsTimes	701107692388089856	2016-02-20T18:14:34	Whether Gove's argument in persuasive or not depends on the value you place on sovereignty. His price is very high; the paramount value. 1/2

PCollinsTimes	701104538988716032	2016-02-20T18:02:02	Perhaps. I suspect, on Europe, he has compromised because his party is so much in favour (which is fair enough).

PCollinsTimes	700353980996698113	2016-02-18T16:19:35	The Times is now in profit. Would you like to see it go under? If so, stop forcing brilliant wit from its columnists 
PCollinsTimes	700352414663229443	2016-02-18T16:13:22	If Corbyn had the press you dream of, would he become PM? 
PCollinsTimes	700350736454934529	2016-02-18T16:06:42	But I want to control the other 76%. Why do they avoid my grip?  
PCollinsTimes	700349308974075904	2016-02-18T16:01:01	So the press DOESN'T control minds then? That seems somewhat at odds with your previous point which was that it does 
PCollinsTimes	700347164468371456	2016-02-18T15:52:30	How long will you give them? It sounds pretty stupid, this British public you describe.  
PCollinsTimes	700346437490626562	2016-02-18T15:49:37	Funny isn't it, that it is always some "other people" whose minds are controlled? Not them, oh no.

PCollinsTimes	700343328370462720	2016-02-18T15:37:15	Only if you think MSM control people, which I don't. If you do, the logic is inescapable.   
PCollinsTimes	700341879318147073	2016-02-18T15:31:30	@ynwa_321 Let's suppose you are right about the media. It's pretty dumb to fall into their trap then, isn't it? Get a leader who can cope.
PCollinsTimes	700340371084206080	2016-02-18T15:25:30	@ynwa_321 It is interesting but it is a small thing. We have to go wider, to readers. A serious politician goes wider again, to the nation.
PCollinsTimes	700340122357796864	2016-02-18T15:24:31	The Times has published pieces by Mr Corbyn and I'm sure will do again, as it should.  
PCollinsTimes	700339910608338944	2016-02-18T15:23:41	@ynwa_321 No, we don't create people's view. You would think me very arrogant if I claimed that. If I could do it I'd start with you.
PCollinsTimes	700338879606472705	2016-02-18T15:19:35	@ynwa_321 With Corbyn I don't believe he can win enough of the electorate. I want Labour to win and I think he is a barrier to that.
PCollinsTimes	700338557911769088	2016-02-18T15:18:18	@ynwa_321 No I genuinely don't. For better or worse I do think what I say. The Times has a range of writers who disagree so we all sound off
PCollinsTimes	700337769579679744	2016-02-18T15:15:10	Wash your mouth.  
PCollinsTimes	700335919711318016	2016-02-18T15:07:49	No, The Times doesn't use capitals. Apart from that, you've got the job.  
PCollinsTimes	700335265047515136	2016-02-18T15:05:13	You seem to be struggling with the concept of a book review in a magazine. You read the book and offer a view.  
PCollinsTimes	700332776113967106	2016-02-18T14:55:20	But I read a whole book on it. It is a book review. About a book about Jeremy's opinions. Which haven't changed.   
PCollinsTimes	700331322942885888	2016-02-18T14:49:33	The next move. Can't answer the question? Change the question.  
PCollinsTimes	700331110648123393	2016-02-18T14:48:42	As this review is bringing hellfire down upon me from fans of the massively successful Mr Corbyn, here it is again.

PCollinsTimes	700327808329981952	2016-02-18T14:35:35	@ynwa_321 That's different. That's not changing your mind by conviction you were wrong. It is a compromise. I do applaud it but not the same
PCollinsTimes	700326434645110785	2016-02-18T14:30:08	If Mr Corbyn has changed his mind on anything significant I am unaware of it, having read a biography of him.  
PCollinsTimes	700325200089477120	2016-02-18T14:25:13	The biography makes this very clear. Maybe he was right in the first place and has no need of further thought.

PCollinsTimes	700282992904769536	2016-02-18T11:37:30	Goes downhill after that,I thought. But thank you.  
PCollinsTimes	700279879049224192	2016-02-18T11:25:08	Jeremy Corbyn has not changed his mind in 30 years. That is rigidity, not consistency, says PCollinsTimes

PCollinsTimes	700251817125535745	2016-02-18T09:33:37	And another thing montie Hello. Would you like to join the Labour party? Our leader is very anti-EU, you know.
PCollinsTimes	700251626506952704	2016-02-18T09:32:52	And montie you say austerity is too slow yet when the EU demands the same it is, for a reason you don't give, too quick. Why?
PCollinsTimes	700251281911369729	2016-02-18T09:31:30	And montie you wanted quicker deficit reduction but more spent on defence and to combat inequality. How? Does the money come from pensions?
PCollinsTimes	700250958874460160	2016-02-18T09:30:13	I don't really believe montie there was a feasible deal Cameron could have got that would have satisfied you. You were Out no matter what.
PCollinsTimes	700250732415578112	2016-02-18T09:29:19	I don't understand montie how you can worry about inequality (as I know you do) and yet cite the Thatcher years in approval.
PCollinsTimes	700247135653068801	2016-02-18T09:15:01	LeaBenne Dannythefink Yes, I take your point. My critique is that so many such choices are forced upon them.

PCollinsTimes	690489148730400769	2016-01-22T11:00:16	anthonypainter marcusaroberts The trick is to work out a leader is not viable BEFORE the public tells you. Brown and Miliband were obvious
PCollinsTimes	690487899633106944	2016-01-22T10:55:18	anthonypainter marcusaroberts It's easy. 1. Don't ever use words or thoughts like that and 2. leadership, which contains everything.

PCollinsTimes	690242398190968832	2016-01-21T18:39:46	Exactly. 
PCollinsTimes	690240406634766336	2016-01-21T18:31:51	I have read a lot of Beckett today in preparation for a column. Not all of it Margaret.

PCollinsTimes	689784796365635584	2016-01-20T12:21:25	We are extremely saddened by the death of W&amp;N founder Lord Weidenfeld - inspiration, mentor and ‘publishing genius’ 
PCollinsTimes	689792344980332545	2016-01-20T12:51:25	They'd be wrong. It was a waste of money. They'd have won if Crosby had picked his nose for a month.

PCollinsTimes	686519884348559361	2016-01-11T12:07:50	A day to remind what I care about. There is nothing that could ever happen in politics that could upset me like the death of David Bowie.
