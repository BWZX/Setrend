talktoskirt	719348670869712897	2016-04-11T02:17:42	The people who made me less self-conscious about my period were the ones who layed down the towels.
talktoskirt	719348360541552641	2016-04-11T02:16:28	So the people who made me less self-conscious about my period were not the people covering it up like a gross sin.
talktoskirt	719347909330878464	2016-04-11T02:14:41	A guy that I had liked so much that it took me over a year to say hi to had now watched me put in a tampon. It was liberating.
talktoskirt	719347461173682178	2016-04-11T02:12:54	He seemed almost fascinated at how it worked. And I was fascinated by letting someone see me put in a tampon.
talktoskirt	719347297415532545	2016-04-11T02:12:15	After we were done I said I needed to pop in another tampon. And he asked if he could see. And it wasn't sexual at all. He just looked.
talktoskirt	719347017416355840	2016-04-11T02:11:08	My high school boyfriend and I took a day. And we boned in the shower on my period. And he washed me and toweled me off. It was quite sweet.
talktoskirt	719346739111731201	2016-04-11T02:10:02	What made me less self-conscious about my period? Having period sex!
talktoskirt	719346159471341568	2016-04-11T02:07:43	talktoskirt ugh the "inconvenient" argument. this is basically saying sex should be like it is in the movies.
talktoskirt	719346257588789249	2016-04-11T02:08:07	I don't doubt that that's real. I'm sure it is. I'm sure many women feel this way. But the solution isn't "hide your icky period!"
talktoskirt	719345948707667968	2016-04-11T02:06:53	YOU'RE THIRTY FUCKING YEARS OLD AND YOU FEEL SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT YOUR PERIOD?!
talktoskirt	719345819242119168	2016-04-11T02:06:22	Another awful review. "I feel self-conscious about having sex on my period." THAT'S THE POINT. TO BE VULNERABLE. 
talktoskirt	719345488722554880	2016-04-11T02:05:03	The FLEXisfun tactic is marketing to MEN so they can annoy the partners to get it to continue fucking them on their periods. Not for women.
talktoskirt	719343924624695296	2016-04-11T01:58:51	Hey, remember I said they aren't making this product for women? Proof: 1st testimonial on their site is by a man. 
talktoskirt	719343570700906496	2016-04-11T01:57:26	"Now you don't have to have the intimacies that come along with having sex and you can go back to being reduced to a fuckbag!"
talktoskirt	719343231914405888	2016-04-11T01:56:05	But lucky for us, some chick who just discovered her own twat 20 minutes ago invented a product to eliminate the intimacies of period sex!
talktoskirt	719342922869682176	2016-04-11T01:54:52	I rarely have period sex, but when I do, it's for the bonding experience of being vulnerable.
talktoskirt	719342750500593664	2016-04-11T01:54:11	And the sweetness of lying there afterwards, vulnerable with blood, as he cleans you, as you crumple the towel, as you shower together.
talktoskirt	719342449185984512	2016-04-11T01:52:59	Laying down the towel is probably the last remaining sacred sex-preparation act.
talktoskirt	719342110730821632	2016-04-11T01:51:38	This company's pitch includes "don't worry about washing your towels, or yourselves". That's the best part!
talktoskirt	719341110431203329	2016-04-11T01:47:40	The whole bond of period sex comes from being covered in blood and the sweetness in the post-coital clean-up.
talktoskirt	719340913223462913	2016-04-11T01:46:53	Also, if you want to have sex with me while I'm on my period, you're going to get covered in my blood. That's the cost.
talktoskirt	719340651503034368	2016-04-11T01:45:50	talktoskirt that is where the devil comes from obviously.
talktoskirt	719340512956821505	2016-04-11T01:45:17	Guys, your founder just recently discovered her own "peehole" is she ready for the challenge of a uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes?
talktoskirt	719339641040683008	2016-04-11T01:41:49	Here's the kicker: they sell t-shirts and mugs with a little graphic of a uterus on it.
talktoskirt	719337672779657216	2016-04-11T01:34:00	And it's not surprising that an adult who is just now getting a handmirror between her legs doesn't get that.
talktoskirt	719337409721274369	2016-04-11T01:32:57	So when I see someone making a product for blood-free period sex, I don't think that person is making a product for me.
talktoskirt	719337066509778945	2016-04-11T01:31:35	I don't hate having period sex because it's gross, or messy, or too wet. I hate it because my entire vagina feels completely different.
talktoskirt	719336856014438400	2016-04-11T01:30:45	With that being said, I am someone who hates having period sex. I hate it.
talktoskirt	719336617966755840	2016-04-11T01:29:49	I don't look at my period blood on a tampon or oozing out of me and think "gross!" I'm like Anne Frank; I think "that's a sweet secret."
talktoskirt	719336341155274752	2016-04-11T01:28:43	Women aren't disgusted by their own period blood. That's not a problem women have.
talktoskirt	719336233248362496	2016-04-11T01:28:17	Why do I say that? Because we women have been swimming in our own period blood for years. We've all woken up soaked in it. It's fine.
talktoskirt	719336056030629890	2016-04-11T01:27:35	First of all: this product is for men, not for women.
talktoskirt	719335885389635584	2016-04-11T01:26:54	Let's talk about the product: It's a feminine hygiene product that enables women to have blood-free sex whilst on their periods.
talktoskirt	719335696125837312	2016-04-11T01:26:09	This is a joke, right? You're making feminine hygiene products and you are an adult who calls a urethra "peehole" and just now found it?
talktoskirt	719335434740985860	2016-04-11T01:25:06	This is a description of the person who founded feminine hygiene product. She "didn't know where her 'peehole' was".

talktoskirt	709185704568483840	2016-03-14T01:13:42	Seriously, sunscreen matters, people.
talktoskirt	709185214279512066	2016-03-14T01:11:45	I was planning on holding off on actually meeting anyone but this guy seems normal and chill and no pressure. This should be cool.
talktoskirt	709184906023333889	2016-03-14T01:10:32	Also: I love a man who remembers the sunscreen. It's so important. And so are snacks. This guy gets it.
talktoskirt	709184486081208320	2016-03-14T01:08:52	.govttrader A lot of your tweets to me read as hateful of women in an Elliot Rodger kind of way. Others feel the same. Please be mindful.
talktoskirt	709183791298957313	2016-03-14T01:06:06	"Well, you sort of know me now! So we should hang out in the neighborhood."

talktoskirt	709180042295828481	2016-03-14T00:51:12	I just feel uncomfortable now. This is not how to have a natural conversation. 
talktoskirt	709178945225228288	2016-03-14T00:46:51	Guys try to move you off and away from the dating site quickly and it's like a bad car salesman trying to close a deal. It's awful.

talktoskirt	709177303197163520	2016-03-14T00:40:19	I hate it when guys on dating sites ask me for my number right away. I don't know you; I'm not giving you direct access to my life.

talktoskirt	708468436364615680	2016-03-12T01:43:32	I thanked him for taking my side. He said "how could I not?!"

talktoskirt	708350196565020672	2016-03-11T17:53:42	Look at this shit. 
talktoskirt	708349611073785856	2016-03-11T17:51:22	So people have to have the most sterilized conversations so as to not give off the "signal" that they are there for random fucking.
talktoskirt	708349306248544256	2016-03-11T17:50:09	Which hurts the people who aren't looking for that. And that's how a naughty by nature joke turned into sex toys within a minute of convo.
talktoskirt	708349080460775424	2016-03-11T17:49:15	People became more comfortable in asking for random fucking from strangers.
talktoskirt	708348993294700544	2016-03-11T17:48:55	We were told Tinder was for random fucking. So people assumed that approaching people for random fucking on all apps was more okay/approp.
talktoskirt	708348780047962114	2016-03-11T17:48:04	This is what Tinder has done to ruin dating apps.
talktoskirt	708348629162057728	2016-03-11T17:47:28	Is this why women are opening Bumble conversations with "hiiiii"? Because anything beyond that means "i want ur dick"?
talktoskirt	708348290232918016	2016-03-11T17:46:07	Exactly. If you don't get it, maybe give benefit of the doubt before assuming stranger seeks you for sex.

talktoskirt	707981066246733826	2016-03-10T17:26:54	"How are you" is what you say to someone you don't give a shit about to meaninglessly fill an awkward silence.
talktoskirt	707980936814698496	2016-03-10T17:26:23	I hate being asked "how are you?" What other way is there to respond besides "Good. How are you?"

talktoskirt	707682899768819712	2016-03-09T21:42:06	CJJ1267 Exactly. Any time women state physical preferences, it enfuriates men. Speaks to this point:

talktoskirt	707681676491501569	2016-03-09T21:37:14	talktoskirt but reason I ask is bc recently heard a guy get outraged that a girl was judging him for his height. Which is rank hypocrisy
talktoskirt	707679854536298496	2016-03-09T21:30:00	CJJ1267 I'm not extremely picky on body type either as long as not overweight. But even perfect body but at 5'8", tough to find attractive.
talktoskirt	707679369867739136	2016-03-09T21:28:04	CJJ1267 On physical priorities it's at the top. Hair, eyes, skin all take a backseat to height.

talktoskirt	707675809763434496	2016-03-09T21:13:55	I'm going to get in trouble for saying all of this but whatever.
talktoskirt	707675655236935680	2016-03-09T21:13:18	And the fingerbanging I got was always as a means to get to where he wanted to go, not to where I wanted go.
talktoskirt	707675374432460800	2016-03-09T21:12:11	And there were a few times where he tried to venture into things I liked but it was so obvious he didn't enjoy them that we didn't get far.
talktoskirt	707675095288954880	2016-03-09T21:11:05	I don't cum from vaginal intercourse, but he'd still try to fuck one out of me in his own way.
talktoskirt	707674971364061185	2016-03-09T21:10:35	And he wanted me to cum, but wanted me to cum by his methods rather than my own.
talktoskirt	707674799812820992	2016-03-09T21:09:54	Not once was even a moment--not even the night but just a moment--about my needs rather than his.
talktoskirt	707674425869602816	2016-03-09T21:08:25	You know, I fucked Unboyfriend over the course of two years and not once did he make cum.
talktoskirt	707673948415254529	2016-03-09T21:06:31	Just put aside a few minutes to get her off first before it goes back to you being the center or the universe, asshole.
talktoskirt	707673659159216128	2016-03-09T21:05:22	Women are so deeply unsatisfied with sex that they are paying $200 to have someone wearing gloves rub their box for 15 minutes.

talktoskirt	707670820072591360	2016-03-09T20:54:06	Of course other hot guys with good jobs/education doesn't guarantee good taste in music, books, banging.

talktoskirt	707662492756000769	2016-03-09T20:21:00	.brandon_jmu I think this is allowed because it is under the guise of hokey shit. We must ban hokey shit.

talktoskirt	707661707821391873	2016-03-09T20:17:53	So I guess it's a fine business model except I don't want to get fingerbanged with gloves on.
talktoskirt	707661543438213121	2016-03-09T20:17:14	Part of me thinks this is ridiculous; the other part of me would pay a couple hundred bucks for a good fingerbang. 
talktoskirt	707661322780065792	2016-03-09T20:16:21	Neither; it's a variation of fingerbanging.

talktoskirt	707639928927207425	2016-03-09T18:51:21	.govttrader Or perhaps it is because online you give the vibe of the type of guy who would kill a woman who rejects him. runnergoslow
talktoskirt	707639684562817024	2016-03-09T18:50:22	govttrader runnergoslow Then perhaps you should stick to dating women you meet in real life instead of Tinder.

talktoskirt	707603396338061312	2016-03-09T16:26:10	I say in my profile Manhattan or Brooklyn only. I get so many messages that are like "what about Virginia?" FUCKING NO.
talktoskirt	707603151852011521	2016-03-09T16:25:12	.nifkinjuice @entmtb Exactly. And this is where most guys flounder because they don't want to fill out profiles.
talktoskirt	707602944821223428	2016-03-09T16:24:23	There's no point in filling out a profile or dictating your interests, hobbies, dating criteria because men will ignore them all anyway.
talktoskirt	707602760838025216	2016-03-09T16:23:39	Men don't care! They don't care if they don't live in your city, state, or even country. They want to put their dick in you. And that's it.
talktoskirt	707602614544896001	2016-03-09T16:23:04	How many of you women are constantly receiving messages from men who don't even live in your state?
talktoskirt	707602521062293506	2016-03-09T16:22:42	This isn't limited to attractiveness either. This can apply to career, religion, or even geography/location.

talktoskirt	707599747977244672	2016-03-09T16:11:41	talktoskirt ...a good rule of thumb is stay within 50 bps
talktoskirt	707601630498332674	2016-03-09T16:19:09	Moving dating online doesn't change dynamics; women still mostly just warding off guys trying to meaninglessly shove their dicks in them.
talktoskirt	707599601822515200	2016-03-09T16:11:06	Dating sites aren't useful for women if the men don't approach it or participate ot any differently than they would in a bar.
talktoskirt	707599378740019201	2016-03-09T16:10:13	Dating sites for women are a losing game.
talktoskirt	707598782238728192	2016-03-09T16:07:50	I see this question a lot. People have a pretty good general idea of attractiveness. Let us not pretend. 
talktoskirt	707597406787862528	2016-03-09T16:02:22	talktoskirt I bitched about this one day. I don't think you were back. It's annoying AF. We are just supposed to give them a chance.
talktoskirt	707596733459656704	2016-03-09T15:59:42	govttrader I am talking about actual dating sites, not Tinder.
talktoskirt	707596410477268992	2016-03-09T15:58:25	There's weird hypocrisy in assumption that women shouldn't care about attractiveness of men but men deserve more attractive women.
talktoskirt	707595746237915136	2016-03-09T15:55:47	But not realizing every other bozo is doing the same. And never thinking about the woman who thinks "I deserve a guy I find attractive."
talktoskirt	707595581984804864	2016-03-09T15:55:07	When guys are swinging for the fences with women way out of their league, they're thinking "I deserve a shot."
talktoskirt	707594941116108801	2016-03-09T15:52:35	A less attractive guy in real life you already know is not the same as unattractive guy #2000 in your inbox that week.
talktoskirt	707594747368611840	2016-03-09T15:51:48	What they don't get is that every guy is doing this. All of them are swinging for the fences.
talktoskirt	707594593672564736	2016-03-09T15:51:12	This is the logic of men who try for women too far out of their league. 
talktoskirt	707594410125561856	2016-03-09T15:50:28	govttrader I'm not going to give every unattractive creep a shot--I'd be giving too many shots since every guy is swinging for the fences.
talktoskirt	707593339726594048	2016-03-09T15:46:13	This strategy drives women away. I deleted all my profiles; too tired of sifting through hundreds of guys I'd never touch.

talktoskirt	707592158841278464	2016-03-09T15:41:31	HighlySalassee I think depending on the person it is a different balance of both. NY men in general think they deserve it. joshuademasi

talktoskirt	707590947891187712	2016-03-09T15:36:43	The better and more efficient strategy for men would be to not try so far out of their league. 
talktoskirt	707590751610339329	2016-03-09T15:35:56	We care. It's exhausting to get inundated by unattractive guys we're not interested in. 
talktoskirt	707590268585975809	2016-03-09T15:34:01	.BrainScreams It's not an advantage; we have inboxes full of ugly guys we'd never touch.
talktoskirt	707589846282403840	2016-03-09T15:32:20	As terrible as it sounds, I often see profiles of men who message me and the disparity in their attractiveness to mine is almost offensive.
talktoskirt	707589309877059584	2016-03-09T15:30:12	"So a woman who sifts through her inbox is most likely fielding entreaties from men less attractive than she is." This is so true.
talktoskirt	707589025880797184	2016-03-09T15:29:04	"Men send messages to women 17 percentage points more 'attractive' than themselves [on dating sites]". Truth.

talktoskirt	705962362667470848	2016-03-05T03:45:18	No one has discussed this with me or asked me about this. Just...we're coming and you're going to hang out with us.
talktoskirt	705962237358374914	2016-03-05T03:44:48	A person I have never met has bought me a gift and thinks it's a good idea to spring a visit on me and force a meeting on me.
talktoskirt	705962052079259649	2016-03-05T03:44:04	Think about that.
talktoskirt	705962010295586816	2016-03-05T03:43:54	Then she says, "he bought you a present on our trip! We're going to come to New York to see you!"
talktoskirt	705961729327570945	2016-03-05T03:42:47	She somehow managed to turn him into a sympathetic character.
talktoskirt	705961642463469568	2016-03-05T03:42:26	And for most of the conversation I was actually defending this poor guy to her about the birthday things.
talktoskirt	705961540286078976	2016-03-05T03:42:01	And I never say anything bad about this guy to her, I just listen uncomfortably and try to give my best advice regardless.
talktoskirt	705961400691269632	2016-03-05T03:41:28	At this point, she and I are talking on the phone about this.
talktoskirt	705960983051763714	2016-03-05T03:39:49	"He let me help pick it out though!" That doesn't mean anything!
talktoskirt	705960856610328577	2016-03-05T03:39:18	So now she is basically paying off a portion of this dude's mortgage on a property in which she has no equity.
talktoskirt	705960655250182144	2016-03-05T03:38:30	Even better: he suddenly decided to BUY this house after he started dating her. Then wants her to move in. She makes way more than he does.
talktoskirt	705960349359538176	2016-03-05T03:37:18	I had no idea about this. She was going to let me come visit and spring that on me. "Surprise! You're staying at this stranger's place!"
talktoskirt	705960005686665217	2016-03-05T03:35:56	She is with the guy for less than a year, the first 2 months of which he was engaged to a different person, and now they live together.
talktoskirt	705959785527693313	2016-03-05T03:35:03	"Well, it'd be hard for you not to hang out with him since we live together."
talktoskirt	705959697623420928	2016-03-05T03:34:42	But I also admit that I've been hesitant about visiting because I think she will just force me to hang out with her bf the whole time.
talktoskirt	705959447458406400	2016-03-05T03:33:43	She then asks if I am going to visit at all for the rest of the year. I tell her I'm not able to with my schedule/various commitments.
talktoskirt	705959124748673025	2016-03-05T03:32:26	Nonrelatedsense It was jewelry. It was ugly jewelry. And a set of fancy pajamas from Saks. Not a great gift but not worth crying about.
talktoskirt	705958935791083520	2016-03-05T03:31:41	And so here I am in a full blown conversation about this relationship. 
talktoskirt	705958435548962816	2016-03-05T03:29:41	She goes on to say that she was so upset about her gift that she went off on the guy and made him cry.
talktoskirt	705958294934917126	2016-03-05T03:29:08	This isn't surprising behaviour from her but I was mortified nonetheless.
talktoskirt	705958177569906688	2016-03-05T03:28:40	And goes on this tirade about how terrible his birthday present to her was. 
talktoskirt	705957899491745793	2016-03-05T03:27:33	And of course she starts talking about him immediately. 
talktoskirt	705957133410562048	2016-03-05T03:24:31	I waited a couple days until after her birthday to say anything because I didn't want to hear more about her boyfriend.
talktoskirt	705956995598295040	2016-03-05T03:23:58	Then, in August, it was my sister's birthday.
talktoskirt	705956914182680576	2016-03-05T03:23:39	And I didn't make a big deal out of it because I ended up being okay and my friends took care of me.
talktoskirt	705956740798521344	2016-03-05T03:22:57	Thankfully I have my gang of trusty exes who all handheld me through the shitty time of me being terrified of the unknown.
talktoskirt	705956323125547009	2016-03-05T03:21:18	Never checked on me, asked me anything beyond that. She's a doctor; she didn't even try to help with information.
talktoskirt	705956157454680064	2016-03-05T03:20:38	She asked if I was getting an ultrasound, then asked me our old housekeeper's name, then started talking about her vacation with her bf.
talktoskirt	705955896539668480	2016-03-05T03:19:36	In the summer, I told her about the doctor finding a lump in my breast. This was it. 
talktoskirt	705954747308777472	2016-03-05T03:15:02	I told her we should plan something together for the Christmas holiday. She said no. Changed subject to her bf.
talktoskirt	705954541959835648	2016-03-05T03:14:13	And even if I didn't dislike him, that would still be annoying.
talktoskirt	705954456102445057	2016-03-05T03:13:52	For the next 6 months, every single time I talked to her, she would talk about her boyfriend. Even though she knows I don't like him.
talktoskirt	705954262732423168	2016-03-05T03:13:06	That wasn't really sufficient to undo what she had told me before.
talktoskirt	705953893528821762	2016-03-05T03:11:38	She wouldn't give me the details much aside from that he didn't really want to be with the fiancée.
talktoskirt	705953755267768320	2016-03-05T03:11:05	She says she got back the guy, he broke up with his fiancée and he "explained the whole thing".
talktoskirt	705953582525321216	2016-03-05T03:10:24	memphisgrizz55 This is the backstory.
talktoskirt	705953437159198720	2016-03-05T03:09:50	About 6 weeks later, she and I are chatting and she says something about her boyfriend. "What boyfriend?"
talktoskirt	705953288848592896	2016-03-05T03:09:14	And apparently he hid from her when he was caught; blocking her on various social media and whatnot.
talktoskirt	705953133701275648	2016-03-05T03:08:37	So this guy met my sister on a dating site, dated her for 2 months while he was fully engaged to another woman.
talktoskirt	705953002096599040	2016-03-05T03:08:06	A month or so later, she calls me to say that she found out from a mutual friend that the guy was engaged. As in still currently engaged.
talktoskirt	705952824434302976	2016-03-05T03:07:23	I told her to give the guy a chance to win; get to know him more; see where it goes.
talktoskirt	705952711276154884	2016-03-05T03:06:56	She told me she was dating a new guy but that she wasn't sure she liked him. "He's kind of effeminate," she complained.
talktoskirt	705952503913975808	2016-03-05T03:06:07	Last year, on one of my trips to see officialmineral, I stopped to visit with my sister and have dinner.

talktoskirt	703966322254868482	2016-02-28T15:33:44	Maybe this is on my mind because my ex asked me if we could talk during the weekend before I block him out of my life.

talktoskirt	703963546711937024	2016-02-28T15:22:43	Sometimes I feel strange that he has still talked to me all this time throughout the years. I always thought I meant nothing to him.

talktoskirt	701612510835822592	2016-02-22T03:40:32	By now, though, I started to wonder about leaving my job. Even though my pay and duties increased, I felt like it was time to move on.
talktoskirt	701612324684177408	2016-02-22T03:39:48	I moved into an apartment that was only ~$100 more.
talktoskirt	701612225660895232	2016-02-22T03:39:24	I was making 50% more than I had when I (and author) started the job. But did I take on a $1245/month apartment? No. Of course not.
talktoskirt	701611987197935620	2016-02-22T03:38:27	After a year though, my lease was up and my roommate finished her master's. So I had to find a new apartment.

talktoskirt	701609591528886272	2016-02-22T03:28:56	Oh, and I paid for those things out of pocket because, unlike the author, I did not have benefits. 
talktoskirt	701609253174427648	2016-02-22T03:27:35	Around that point, I also joined a mid-tier gym and started seeing a therapist regularly. All for about the same pay as the author.

talktoskirt	701608362094546944	2016-02-22T03:24:03	I took on more responsibilities and within maybe 6 months, I asked for and received a raise to $15/hour.
talktoskirt	701608108674703360	2016-02-22T03:23:03	Anyway, back to the story. I made $12/hour. But I really tried to work hard in my position, learn what I could, contribute to the team.
talktoskirt	701607914432307200	2016-02-22T03:22:16	She was so sweet. She made me a cake when I moved in. I helped her with her English. And she said my Chinese was pretty good!

talktoskirt	701607377217449984	2016-02-22T03:20:08	I moved in with a roommate. I paid something like $5-600/month in rent for a decent apartment in a safe neighbourhood.

talktoskirt	701605745612234752	2016-02-22T03:13:39	But I jumped on the offer because it was at a place where I thought I could learn and grow as well as contribute.
talktoskirt	701605624807874565	2016-02-22T03:13:10	I had $4 when I got that job offer. I couldn't even accept the offer over the phone because I didn't have one anymore.

talktoskirt	701604667076182016	2016-02-22T03:09:22	Homegirl, if you can't recognize that you shouldn't spend 80% of your wages on rent, you may not be in a position to give advice to the CEO.
talktoskirt	701604309050466305	2016-02-22T03:07:57	Here's another example from the author:

talktoskirt	701603741510844416	2016-02-22T03:05:41	That includes writing an open letter to the CEO of your company so you can publicly be an asshole to him.

talktoskirt	701602576568082432	2016-02-22T03:01:04	With that extra money, just by living in LA with the same wage, she could visit SF once a month (150 round trip on Southwest).
talktoskirt	701602333050933248	2016-02-22T03:00:05	Even with the $12/hr job, she could save probably another $200 on rent every month.
talktoskirt	701602185017225216	2016-02-22T02:59:30	LA is still expensive relative to, oh, middle America. But there are definitely more affordable living options than SF.
talktoskirt	701601955261636608	2016-02-22T02:58:35	Even if she chose someplace only moderately cheaper like Los Angeles.
talktoskirt	701601690148069376	2016-02-22T02:57:32	With just a little bit of critical thinking, this author could have chosen a less expensive city instead where her wage would go further.
talktoskirt	701601387025666053	2016-02-22T02:56:20	With just a little poking around on ye olde internet, it's quite apparent that SF is the most expensive city in the US for rent.

talktoskirt	701599067391000576	2016-02-22T02:47:07	Here the author wonders how much better her life would be if she made an extra $24k a year.

talktoskirt	701595300369145857	2016-02-22T02:32:09	Here she writes "you know what I could do with an extra $600/month?" That was well within her reach.

talktoskirt	701120492950986754	2016-02-20T19:05:26	If Uber and AmericanExpress like my story about Robin as much as I liked her, she's going to get a little something for being so kind.
talktoskirt	701120258065694721	2016-02-20T19:04:30	Apparently, this means that Robin is nominated for extra cash and prizes from uber and AmericanExpress.

talktoskirt	700907814311620609	2016-02-20T05:00:19	Lady followers, have you ever been harassed at work? Did you report it or do anything about it? Why or why not?
talktoskirt	700907043180388356	2016-02-20T04:57:15	In that case, I said I felt in control of the situation and not in danger. I don't care to get the guy fired. But that is now on record.
talktoskirt	700906789034926080	2016-02-20T04:56:15	Most recently, I spent a couple months with HR because I reported something to my boss that I had already told my colleagues.

talktoskirt	700905877579108352	2016-02-20T04:52:38	The first big one came in form of an email. As soon as I saw it, I forwarded it to the head of the group and walked right into his office.
talktoskirt	700905597768757248	2016-02-20T04:51:31	I think I've reported one or another at all but one firm I've worked at in the past 5 years.

talktoskirt	700904755128889344	2016-02-20T04:48:10	I am trying to understand why this annoys me so much and I think it's because, at the heart of it, this is workplace/labor dispute.

talktoskirt	700898596225470465	2016-02-20T04:23:42	jamiepastore It's the courts. California courts tend to be very liberal and strongly favor labor in these types of disputes.
talktoskirt	700898080208658432	2016-02-20T04:21:39	Also, I believe this is why these label contracts are negotiated and signed in New York and not in LA.
talktoskirt	700897809374035968	2016-02-20T04:20:34	czwalsh The producer is, in fact, suing her for defamation. kylef
talktoskirt	700897146057396224	2016-02-20T04:17:56	Which I wouldn't be surprised if her legal team was banking on to create PR nightmare so Sony will release her from her contract.
talktoskirt	700896928113016832	2016-02-20T04:17:04	And it's hard not to see this as another example of media fueled unnecessary outrage.
talktoskirt	700896765248147456	2016-02-20T04:16:25	If you actually read beyond the click-bait headlines about the Kesha case, it reads very badly for her.
talktoskirt	700896573107130368	2016-02-20T04:15:39	kylef It happens to women in every industry. I've been harassed at almost every job, but I didn't sue the firm for it 10yrs later.
talktoskirt	700895645784260608	2016-02-20T04:11:58	kylef I think that's a weak case. There's no evidence for any of her claims. It seems like her tactic is to smear until they let her go.
talktoskirt	700895231277928449	2016-02-20T04:10:19	kylef how could they be negligent if there was no reason to ever think he was a danger? The case doesn't look good for her.
talktoskirt	700894963467481088	2016-02-20T04:09:15	kylef One of her claims is that Sony puts women at risk by having them work with him but she never reported the alleged abuse to them so+
talktoskirt	700894706327281665	2016-02-20T04:08:14	kylef But she's allowed to record/create with other producers. She is just choosing not to because she wants to be released from label.

talktoskirt	700894406589677568	2016-02-20T04:07:03	kylef She's sabotaging her own career. It's so weird. The whole premise of requesting the injunction was her lawyers saying because she+
talktoskirt	700893999960354816	2016-02-20T04:05:26	kylef 3 years before she filed the lawsuit, she testified underoath that he never raped her or made advances at her or drugged her etc...
talktoskirt	700893760805326852	2016-02-20T04:04:29	kylef I don't want to sound like I'm defending a rapist but after reading up on the case a little bit, it's hard to take her side.
talktoskirt	700891873045565441	2016-02-20T03:56:59	kylef Why is that? She's signed to a label, signed to a contract, they're not releasing her from it, but she can work with other producers.
talktoskirt	700890938365890561	2016-02-20T03:53:16	Making A Murderer made us have empathy for the accused for 5 minutes and then we stopped giving a shit about the rights of the accused.

talktoskirt	700794872232603652	2016-02-19T21:31:32	fordm I've only followed loosely but it doesn't look good for her. The defense is doing their job on this one.
talktoskirt	700794564119023617	2016-02-19T21:30:18	And pointing that out is not gaslighting.
talktoskirt	700794510041817088	2016-02-19T21:30:05	I'm not saying it's not possible she's telling the truth. I'm saying that the evidence against her claims seem very strong.
talktoskirt	700794320253800454	2016-02-19T21:29:20	Kesha herself, in sworn testimony, said he never made advances towards her or made her do drugs or anything she's claiming now.
talktoskirt	700794147419111425	2016-02-19T21:28:39	those claims, then how or why would Sony have reason to believe he was a danger?
talktoskirt	700793981765025792	2016-02-19T21:28:00	She alleges that the label puts women in physical danger by having them work with this producer. But if neither she nor others ever made+
talktoskirt	700793695487008769	2016-02-19T21:26:51	And I don't agree with thefader's characterization of SonyMusicGlobal's defense against KeshaRose's claims as gaslighting.
talktoskirt	700792997588426752	2016-02-19T21:24:05	Kesha's career is fucked. 
talktoskirt	700774481166516226	2016-02-19T20:10:30	bryan_hayslip That is not what I said. You missed my point entirely, Bryan.
talktoskirt	700773774665326593	2016-02-19T20:07:42	Of course the guy who doesn't want to pay for it won't pay for it. But even the guy who thinks it should be paid for doesn't want to pay it.

talktoskirt	700744008209928192	2016-02-19T18:09:25	schaudenfraud My point is that they act incredibly morally righteous about it.
talktoskirt	700743613588885505	2016-02-19T18:07:51	That's subjective. I wouldn't agree that good politics means ignoring the past/present.

talktoskirt	700743010405916672	2016-02-19T18:05:27	My friends who are high earners and support Bernie, I ask them "why don't you help pay someone's tuition now?"
talktoskirt	700742433877798912	2016-02-19T18:03:10	And how much does cutting the interest rate on the millenials loan really help when, on the other end, you're raising their taxes anyway?
talktoskirt	700742181343117312	2016-02-19T18:02:09	But that doesn't seem like it'd be a big help to millenials with low/middle income jobs if they have large balances outstanding.

talktoskirt	700739026542841856	2016-02-19T17:49:37	And so he wants to give free college to next gen but no loan relief to current gen AND raising their taxes.
talktoskirt	700738419861938176	2016-02-19T17:47:13	I think if you want free college the Bernie way, you have to provide loan relief, otherwise you are giving a big fuck you to millenials.

talktoskirt	700179547489173504	2016-02-18T04:46:27	iammattcote They came up in the completely wrong scene is why. Because bands like Copeland and Umbrellas didn't have their own scene.
talktoskirt	700179335941070848	2016-02-18T04:45:37	iammattcote I've always thought of Umbrellas as deep, romantic and poetic. And Copeland more emo/whiney.
talktoskirt	700179130302730241	2016-02-18T04:44:48	iammattcote They just toured on their 2 new records last year. They were great.
talktoskirt	700178892640948224	2016-02-18T04:43:51	iammattcote That being said; I think Umbrellas far surpasses Copeland.
talktoskirt	700178772725727232	2016-02-18T04:43:22	iammattcote I'm a Copeland fan and I have never thought of that before. I get it completely. I can't believe I never thought of that.
talktoskirt	700177896531484672	2016-02-18T04:39:53	The show I had gone to was on their last tour as a band. I never got to see them as an actual fan.
talktoskirt	700177742420115456	2016-02-18T04:39:17	And I still listen to a lot of their songs frequently; they have held up very well.
talktoskirt	700177641693974528	2016-02-18T04:38:53	I went home and did listen to Umbrellas and they became one of my favorite bands.
talktoskirt	700177477621125120	2016-02-18T04:38:13	I saw all three of them play and I had a great time.
talktoskirt	700177375921905665	2016-02-18T04:37:49	I was so excited to see ZookeeperLuvsMe and LYDIAmusic that I didn't listen to the third band, Umbrellas, before the show.
talktoskirt	700177166001168385	2016-02-18T04:36:59	So the first time I met Chris Simpson from officialmineral was at a show where LYDIAmusic and a band called Umbrellas played.

talktoskirt	700172160493559808	2016-02-18T04:17:06	You all had much better insights than I did tonight. I did not come with prepared remarks.

talktoskirt	700168876299063298	2016-02-18T04:04:03	And these are the conversations we have now. 
talktoskirt	700168061291253760	2016-02-18T04:00:48	Nine years later, I thought about him, for the first time, as a person instead of as "my dad" and I empathized with him. And I let him win.
talktoskirt	700167619224141824	2016-02-18T03:59:03	My advice would be: Let people win. Let them be sorry. Let them help you. Let them be nice to you.
talktoskirt	700167111054925824	2016-02-18T03:57:02	It felt awkward. He was trying. And I shut him down. That was our shot. And I killed it. It's one of the most shameful things I've done.
talktoskirt	700166651220791296	2016-02-18T03:55:12	One of my biggest regrets is when my parents divorced and I turned down my dad's multiple attempts to take me to dinner.

talktoskirt	700165176218275841	2016-02-18T03:49:21	I wish I would have asked for help sooner.
talktoskirt	700164720075141120	2016-02-18T03:47:32	My advice would be: don't waste time on these and you can get over anything in 90 days; it's fine.

talktoskirt	700160065093894144	2016-02-18T03:29:02	talktoskirt play it safe a lot less, make mistakes and own them, don't try to please everyone and don't compare yourself to others as much

talktoskirt	700149637827661824	2016-02-18T02:47:36	To express regret or think of a way to have done something better or differently doesn't mean you have to hate yourself now.
