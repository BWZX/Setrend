HeyVeronica	716999076366184450	2016-04-04T14:41:15	katienotopoulos do you think she can fly?
HeyVeronica	716986699016962048	2016-04-04T13:52:04	HairySkeletor true! But I think the  value of options is often portrayed.... Unrealistically
HeyVeronica	716986251522547712	2016-04-04T13:50:17	Anyway, uh, educate yourself about stock options &amp; don't accept the "you're not in this for the money" argument when it's time for a raise!
HeyVeronica	716985606912483329	2016-04-04T13:47:44	Not a lot of companies go out of their way to explain stock options to their (probably very young) employees and very few employees ask
HeyVeronica	716985317849481216	2016-04-04T13:46:35	There's also the semi problematic "take a lower salary in exchange for stock options" thing
HeyVeronica	716984873056092160	2016-04-04T13:44:49	Hubspot is obvi insane but the whole "startups are millennial meat grinders" thing is probably true
