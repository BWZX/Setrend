caro	714636126955380737	2016-03-29T02:11:44	jonbirger1 Ahhh, OK, misunderstood there.
caro	714634619019206656	2016-03-29T02:05:45	jonbirger1 I think that‚Äôs a different phenomenon - highly educated women face a barrier with similarly educated men. I‚Äôve encountered it.
caro	714632992157786112	2016-03-29T01:59:17	jonbirger1 This may be why I found dating apps worthless ‚Äî they‚Äôre skewed toward bullet points and ‚Äúways to look good."

caro	714626136035168257	2016-03-29T01:32:02	jonbirger1 e.g. guy hustling up a small business who never went to college vs. guy with film degree from NYU trying to make it as a ‚ÄúDJ"
caro	714625839825072128	2016-03-29T01:30:51	jonbirger1 SO much I could say about that. Half the guys I dated in my 20s never went to college. It‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing now that counts.
caro	714624381566234624	2016-03-29T01:25:04	mbaratz i‚Äôm obsessed with this
caro	714620318422319105	2016-03-29T01:08:55	jonbirger1 Unsurprising! Brooklyn feels like it‚Äôs crawling with men. (And both men and women seem to approach dating equally casually.)
caro	714614737779236868	2016-03-29T00:46:45	jonbirger1 singles scene in Brooklyn seems to also be very balanced in the 30s (but just speaking from experience)
caro	714610459777843200	2016-03-29T00:29:45	jonbirger1 Where/how does Brooklyn factor into that?
caro	714608992459362304	2016-03-29T00:23:55	andrewbaron She‚Äôs still mad at me right now.
caro	714606637948997633	2016-03-29T00:14:33	andrewbaron it all makes total sense.
caro	714606319483949056	2016-03-29T00:13:17	andrewbaron but wouldn‚Äôt it be great if Elon Musk invented a smarter vacuum? I totally get your train of thought there.
caro	714606221236551680	2016-03-29T00:12:54	jonbirger1 I‚Äôm convinced that it‚Äôs because of how dating is treated culturally here. NYC is on one side of the pendulum, SF is on the other
caro	714606144594055170	2016-03-29T00:12:36	jonbirger1 huh. so, I live in NYC, and I find dating here to be horrible, but not because there aren‚Äôt single men here. There are plenty.

caro	714591923206537217	2016-03-28T23:16:05	jonbirger1 I still think that‚Äôs weighted by the many people who move to that region already married, including from SF proper.
caro	714591204718026752	2016-03-28T23:13:14	jonbirger1 Anecdotally, it‚Äôs actually pretty fascinating. But boy is the dating scene there messed up.
caro	714591134165680128	2016-03-28T23:12:57	jonbirger1 Complications in the Bay Area involve employer/line of work, geography/transportation, lack of a dating culture like NYC‚Äôs.
caro	714590826345660416	2016-03-28T23:11:44	jonbirger1 I‚Äôm not single and I‚Äôm not asking for a love doctor. I just think that from a woman‚Äôs perspective the math didn‚Äôt quite add up.
caro	714590075137433600	2016-03-28T23:08:45	jonbirger1 Perhaps. But I‚Äôm an ex-Googler who used to live in the Bay Area. It‚Äôs hardly a dating Disneyland. It‚Äôs actually flat-out awful.
caro	714581311340552192	2016-03-28T22:33:55	jonbirger1 Regardless, I highly doubt SC has much of a singles scene. People move there already married.
caro	714581096793513984	2016-03-28T22:33:04	jonbirger1 It‚Äôs undoubtedly affluence and access to equally educated partners.

caro	714577191758127106	2016-03-28T22:17:33	jonbirger1 The comparison to Manhattan was apples/oranges. People move to SCC because they‚Äôre *already* married. It‚Äôs the suburbs.

caro	714523604843671553	2016-03-28T18:44:37	Of course more women in Santa Clara County are married than in NYC. It‚Äôs SUBURBAN. The singles live in SF.
