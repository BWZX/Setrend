SarahNEmerson	720239142194454530	2016-04-13T13:16:07	Jack Dorsey asked me to tweet about his cash app and in exchange he was supposed to tweet about my mixtape. he never did.

SarahNEmerson	720060646923100160	2016-04-13T01:26:50	In other words, it is unclear whether the story should be that we are getting better at counting tigers rather than a conservation success.
SarahNEmerson	720060254462062593	2016-04-13T01:25:17	Big story today is estimated number of tigers has increased. Yet part of increase is attributed to better sampling tech., not more tigers.

SarahNEmerson	718514677676781568	2016-04-08T19:03:43	hanelly Excedrin is a known OTC migraine pain-killer. Empathy for migraine sufferers is not as palpable a problem as drug safety is
SarahNEmerson	718514237878865920	2016-04-08T19:01:58	hanelly ?
SarahNEmerson	718513185444093952	2016-04-08T18:57:47	hanelly Excedrin presented a problem that doesn't really exist so they could hop on a new tech bandwagon to hawk their product to consumers
SarahNEmerson	718512897689649152	2016-04-08T18:56:38	hanelly if they were really invested in the well-being of migraine sufferers, the company could fund research into developing better drugs
SarahNEmerson	718512524899983360	2016-04-08T18:55:09	hanelly Excedrin's parent company, GSK, is heavily invested in keeping migraine sufferers dependent on their existing drugs
SarahNEmerson	718510712721530884	2016-04-08T18:47:57	Excedrin, I don't want your migraine AR simulator, I just want better drugs

SarahNEmerson	692799492681240576	2016-01-28T20:00:45	saying that it's your fault for having shit commenters isn't realistic when 1. most sites don't have resources and 2. modding is a SHIT JOB
SarahNEmerson	692798507015671808	2016-01-28T19:56:50	there's a mindset that everyone online deserves to be heard and if you yell loud enough you deserve to be heard the most and that's crap

SarahNEmerson	692762910662250500	2016-01-28T17:35:23	qhardy alexrkonrad right. i guess my point is that impact fees are kind of too little too late for certain ecosystems

SarahNEmerson	692738231083896832	2016-01-28T15:57:19	alexrkonrad qhardy it's sooo hard to rebuild a coral reef in the way that landscapes can be restored after, like, oil and gas drilling
SarahNEmerson	692737962757455872	2016-01-28T15:56:15	alexrkonrad qhardy thing is, environmental fines for marine areas don't really work the same way they would for terrestrial ecosystems
SarahNEmerson	692736713597292544	2016-01-28T15:51:17	qhardy his statement on this is basically like, "Wasn't our fault. No backs." But when you have a pro crew, you don't anchor on reef...

SarahNEmerson	686249086715084800	2016-01-10T18:11:46	Jason caseyjohnston wadhwa girlziplocked support expected no less from you. thanks for chatting
SarahNEmerson	686248423381692418	2016-01-10T18:09:08	Jason caseyjohnston wadhwa girlziplocked okay! you can mute/block me and I won't rally a mob to harass you. that's the difference here
SarahNEmerson	686247972041048065	2016-01-10T18:07:21	Jason it's not clear that you're joking and three emojis aren't a disclaimer. your other tweet about expecting trolling is worse, imo
SarahNEmerson	686246841646723077	2016-01-10T18:02:51	Jason caseyjohnston wadhwa misusing the defense of free speech to justify online harassment is old and tired
