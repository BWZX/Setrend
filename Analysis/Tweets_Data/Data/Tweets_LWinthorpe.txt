LWinthorpe	725846086322032641	2016-04-29T00:36:07	WyomingNate yes
LWinthorpe	725845522750136321	2016-04-29T00:33:52	smqtrader I'm all into trends. but 11 weeks and 300 points. Let's not lose sight of that

LWinthorpe	725843845489938432	2016-04-29T00:27:12	smqtrader back to that chart. You don't think we'll see a 60 read on this in the next few weeks?
LWinthorpe	725843541394477056	2016-04-29T00:26:00	smqtrader I think so
LWinthorpe	725842662041870337	2016-04-29T00:22:30	smqtrader but it's not a stock. It's an oscillator. Can't apply same logic there. What do oscillators do? They oscillate.
LWinthorpe	725842128031506432	2016-04-29T00:20:23	smqtrader panic selling was in February. This is not panic selling
LWinthorpe	725840401387544578	2016-04-29T00:13:31	smqtrader now take a look at this and tell me what you see 
LWinthorpe	725840022524432384	2016-04-29T00:12:01	smqtrader we found sellers. no?
LWinthorpe	725839898675023872	2016-04-29T00:11:31	scolglaz thx
LWinthorpe	725838907506483201	2016-04-29T00:07:35	minyarr what was the reason for 30 point drop today?
LWinthorpe	725838591360819200	2016-04-29T00:06:20	this is delta I been talking about all day. delta high was as we put in IBH. then all downhill on each push higher 
LWinthorpe	725838185008230400	2016-04-29T00:04:43	smqtrader for me yes
LWinthorpe	725837966518558720	2016-04-29T00:03:51	smqtrader impulsive down, pullback, continuation. That's normal behavior. what was the catalyst for price action today?
LWinthorpe	725837571062788096	2016-04-29T00:02:17	minyarr that funny why?
LWinthorpe	725835428457123840	2016-04-28T23:53:46	largevoid it's not always helpful. can't build a strategy on it. but at times it plays a key role. today was prime example

LWinthorpe	725834983642779648	2016-04-28T23:52:00	antigut area to explore for me
LWinthorpe	725834866281992192	2016-04-28T23:51:32	largevoid delta I am talking about is difference between lots hit on bid(sold) vs bought (lifted). makes sense?

LWinthorpe	725832937438990336	2016-04-28T23:43:52	smqtrader it has not been easy. but I'm not giving up now.

LWinthorpe	725800390277521408	2016-04-28T21:34:32	Aaaand ... we close below yest range. In other words, a great algo buying opportunity again
LWinthorpe	725800069836902400	2016-04-28T21:33:16	Backed off again, tried again, another lower high, rollover. OTF sells for almost 30 points straight. Buyers step in at last week low.

LWinthorpe	725799383208316928	2016-04-28T21:30:32	So let's review ...
LWinthorpe	725799179558096896	2016-04-28T21:29:43	antigut everyone makes calls all day long. Takes balls to execute.
LWinthorpe	725799027871096832	2016-04-28T21:29:07	antigut no, bud, it's all you.
LWinthorpe	725798180835598336	2016-04-28T21:25:45	antigut well done
LWinthorpe	725797462514880512	2016-04-28T21:22:54	antigut that was before we broke IBH. Once we did I retracted. So no victory lap on this one.
LWinthorpe	725796512815423488	2016-04-28T21:19:07	When I was talking about negative divergences earlier today I didn't think they would play out today. Was thinking more in coming days.
LWinthorpe	725796044370366464	2016-04-28T21:17:16	antigut I tweeted about negative divergences though as we were approaching that ONH
LWinthorpe	725795878175305728	2016-04-28T21:16:36	antigut considering that ONH was a double top and very weak, once we got up there, odds were overwhelmingly in favor of it being tagged
LWinthorpe	725794267524816896	2016-04-28T21:10:12	antigut not always. but at times they do
LWinthorpe	725792780937629696	2016-04-28T21:04:18	TheGuardian Tony Blair: the former PM for hire: Emails show oil firm questioned complex ...  OilNews Oilandgas

LWinthorpe	725792369040216065	2016-04-28T21:02:40	We stopped 3 ticks short of ONH and 1 tick short of last week low. Probably coincidental.
LWinthorpe	725792169357791233	2016-04-28T21:01:52	antigut 65 last week low
LWinthorpe	725791952759754752	2016-04-28T21:01:00	They move Es 30 points at a clip but at the right level it's a game of ticks

LWinthorpe	725771408907722752	2016-04-28T19:39:22	antigut no. today was neutral. as was yest. probability of two in a row very small. once we broke IBH, it was very unlikely we'd see IBL

LWinthorpe	721860788722409472	2016-04-18T00:39:58	of course don't get me started on T2108
LWinthorpe	721860712604311552	2016-04-18T00:39:40	the bigger the gap in ES the less likely it is to close... that's pure stats...
LWinthorpe	721860464833998848	2016-04-18T00:38:40	note the last 2 days in ES was tight balance, so this is breaking away from balance now... unless, of course, we ramp later today

LWinthorpe	721859704125657089	2016-04-18T00:35:39	maybe 2035 - 2040 area ends up being low for the week and we end one timeframing up next week
LWinthorpe	721859504392970240	2016-04-18T00:34:52	as posted last week, I do think 2040 will come into play this week at some point

LWinthorpe	721858702286790656	2016-04-18T00:31:40	those differences were massive when the rally took off Feb lows
LWinthorpe	721858524981014529	2016-04-18T00:30:58	But last week's low was only  3.25 pts above prior week's low, week before that delta was 6.75, week before that 7.
LWinthorpe	721858242469474304	2016-04-18T00:29:51	ES one time framing up for 9 weeks now. That's a decent stretch....

LWinthorpe	721841074226892801	2016-04-17T23:21:37	CL gap zone is 39.25 - 40.50, so looks like those the goal posts for right now

LWinthorpe	720377996222156801	2016-04-13T22:27:52	AustinDamiani for sure
LWinthorpe	720374893246685185	2016-04-13T22:15:33	if you faded strength at extremes like now you most likely took mucho heat, but if you sized it right &amp; had time to wait, you got paid
LWinthorpe	720374546637791232	2016-04-13T22:14:10	if you sold weakness last few weeks you got clobbered every time. you probably lost enough money to give up on the idea
LWinthorpe	720374376676200448	2016-04-13T22:13:29	but look, in a ramp like this, you can't wait for weakness, as some people insist, before selling short.
LWinthorpe	720374153124024320	2016-04-13T22:12:36	stylistically, positioning ahead of where you think sellers otta step in is hard, cause really it's very tricky &amp; highly speculative
LWinthorpe	720373557159550976	2016-04-13T22:10:14	HalfersPower np
LWinthorpe	720373516135043072	2016-04-13T22:10:04	everyone gon tell you timing is everything and it's not wrong. what's more important in the leveraged game of musical chairs is sizing
LWinthorpe	720373266913701888	2016-04-13T22:09:05	the issue here is not whether es shorts get paid. it's when &amp; how much heat you want to take upfront if you are positioning ahead of selling
LWinthorpe	720372736762073090	2016-04-13T22:06:58	HalfersPower sure. Even if we don't break this week's low next week we will likely get down to 50ish next week IMO. That's still good.
LWinthorpe	720372352484188161	2016-04-13T22:05:27	HalfersPower we are at 2075 and low of week is 32.50. I can't wait for 40 point drop before I get bearish
LWinthorpe	720372005057368064	2016-04-13T22:04:04	HalfersPower here's the problem though. for longer term money they are looking for weeks turns. i.e. lower low on weekly chart
LWinthorpe	720371741596385280	2016-04-13T22:03:01	HalfersPower current setup is only for very aggressive shorts like me. Intermediate trend is up, so you can't ignore that
LWinthorpe	720371470103228416	2016-04-13T22:01:56	HalfersPower I don't look at it in isolation. Combined with other factors overall picture does not look bullish near term. 2 weeks out.
LWinthorpe	720371167433875456	2016-04-13T22:00:44	HalfersPower we don't spend much time above bb, by bb itself moves. It just tells you that we are at extreme
LWinthorpe	720370883840225280	2016-04-13T21:59:37	HalfersPower there are a couple of ways to view this. Can be interpreted either bullish or bearish. Depends on one's perspective.

LWinthorpe	714968425370488832	2016-03-30T00:12:10	last time R2K was up as much as today was 1/29. you know how well that worked out in subsequent week
LWinthorpe	714968190686597121	2016-03-30T00:11:14	they bought small caps today. bought that garbage big time. but R2K now right on upper Bol Band. Show me how often it pushes through
LWinthorpe	714967836284686336	2016-03-30T00:09:50	1250atick well... maybe... but I am not sure on that... on trend days value shifts continuously in one direction

LWinthorpe	714964382438924289	2016-03-29T23:56:06	This month we've had a # of occasions where it took a week for double bottom or top to close. Most recent example double top from lst Tue
