BTabrum	712773664027058177	2016-03-23T22:50:58	Chris_Comber honestly, trust me on this, the UK isn't in the €
BTabrum	712773519461982209	2016-03-23T22:50:24	Chris_Comber UK doesn't have a sovereign debt crisis.
BTabrum	712773312934461442	2016-03-23T22:49:35	Chris_Comber but we don't.
BTabrum	712773249126502403	2016-03-23T22:49:19	Chris_Comber no I really don't. The only coherent case for Brexit is 'send the Poles home'. Coherent but obnoxious.
BTabrum	712772988261818368	2016-03-23T22:48:17	Chris_Comber changing the subject again. EU membership, no Schengen, no Euro.
BTabrum	712772757021437953	2016-03-23T22:47:22	Chris_Comber I've read more than someone who thinks there's an EU Court of Human Rights.

BTabrum	712771880692924416	2016-03-23T22:43:53	Chris_Comber that's a yes
BTabrum	712771781166235648	2016-03-23T22:43:29	Chris_Comber and Brexit helps the UK in this respect how?
BTabrum	712771596000358401	2016-03-23T22:42:45	Chris_Comber so Brexit will give worse access to US market than EU will have.
BTabrum	712770828203597825	2016-03-23T22:39:42	Chris_Comber you're the one who wants to reverse worker and human rights protections
BTabrum	712770477320716291	2016-03-23T22:38:19	Chris_Comber presumably UK alone has more leverage vs US than EU does? So if you're worried about TTIP you'd be nuts to vote Out.
BTabrum	712770178631745536	2016-03-23T22:37:07	Chris_Comber why are you changing the subject?
