MikePereira	722917225842274308	2016-04-20T22:37:52	At the Fox upfront sales presentation in Chicago at the Soho House. Serving good stuff. 
MikePereira	722900194413547520	2016-04-20T21:30:11	MarcBerman56 &gt;if the intent of the play was to be a passing play, it is a sack if he is tackled behind the line even if he scrambles.
MikePereira	722623862039539713	2016-04-20T03:12:09	pakrfn TitosVodka AmyTrask farnientewinery &gt;I will personally deliver to your doorstep in September.
MikePereira	722623458010599424	2016-04-20T03:10:32	MarcBerman56 &gt;in order for it to be a sack, it has to be on a play that was designed to be a pass play. QB draw not a sack.
MikePereira	722223151019638784	2016-04-19T00:39:52	My final changes go in next week to the same publisher. I will celebrate with TitosVodka 
MikePereira	718923714226573312	2016-04-09T22:09:05	I am sure the nickname reflects being  knowledgeable and forthcoming.  
MikePereira	716667010143399936	2016-04-03T16:41:44	Way to go, Nikki!! 
MikePereira	716665642297004032	2016-04-03T16:36:18	The world famous Martinsville hot dogs are the best. Had 2 yesterday. More today.
MikePereira	716664923787493376	2016-04-03T16:33:27	RabidPhillyFan &gt;Had 2 yesterday during the practice session. Great!
MikePereira	716664545578774529	2016-04-03T16:31:57	MikePereira &gt;&gt;At Martinsville today. First short track race I will see in person. On FS1 
MikePereira	716664009269907457	2016-04-03T16:29:49	Trying another sport today. At Martinsville. First short track race I have been at. 
MikePereira	712436767849250816	2016-03-23T00:32:16	TomMax13 &gt;&gt;I thought that but that was not the case in college when they went with the rule.
MikePereira	712436594142130176	2016-03-23T00:31:35	Two unsportsmanlike fouls leading to an ejection and the touchback to the 25 yard line appear to be dead. I am surprised by the touchback.
MikePereira	712429161441157120	2016-03-23T00:02:03	Real_DGuar &gt;&gt;Well, if I am going to clean toilets, I won't have to listen to you. See ya.
MikePereira	712428695521112065	2016-03-23T00:00:11	CoachEgghead chrisseubert &gt;&gt;That is what they want, more touchbacks. Returns of kickoffs create major injuries.
MikePereira	712428325642182656	2016-03-22T23:58:43	Congrats to my friend Nikki Sharp for her book that hit the stands today. Great self help book for men and women. 
MikePereira	712426799632809984	2016-03-22T23:52:39	kylebroughton12 &gt;&gt;Not even discussed. Play defense when it counts!!
MikePereira	712426603607752705	2016-03-22T23:51:53	chrisseubert CoachEgghead &gt;&gt;I meant will go away.
MikePereira	712426504018235392	2016-03-22T23:51:29	chrisseubert CoachEgghead &gt;&gt;In by opinion, kickoffs with go away within just a few years.
MikePereira	712426298098909184	2016-03-22T23:50:40	Real_DGuar &gt;&gt;Many times, Real whoever you are. Maybe that is why I work for Fox now and not the League.
MikePereira	712425919969767424	2016-03-22T23:49:10	atticusMB &gt;&gt;That is nice for a change.
MikePereira	712425833244143616	2016-03-22T23:48:49	No proposals made by any of the teams passed. Not surprising either. All changes were proposed by the committee and offciating.
MikePereira	712425169436811264	2016-03-22T23:46:11	BrockTreworgy &gt;&gt;Don't agree, Brock. In basketball it is a technical.
MikePereira	712424966642225155	2016-03-22T23:45:22	As predicted, nothing changes or catch/no catch. I didn't hear about the touchbacks going to the 25. I thought that would pass.
MikePereira	712424644427403265	2016-03-22T23:44:06	7 rule changes passed today and I agree with all of them. Seemed to stay away from adding more replay stoppages. More to discuss tomorrow
MikePereira	711789378574667776	2016-03-21T05:39:46	Dr_Jay0052 &gt;nope. Chops blocks only. Chops are hi/low by two players. Cuts are be one player and legal if from the front.
MikePereira	711788869314867200	2016-03-21T05:37:45	DavidJMurray4 &gt;not til around the start of the 2016 season. Thanks for asking.
MikePereira	711788470587531264	2016-03-21T05:36:10	12sec317 &gt; As I said, fraught with problems. Good point.
MikePereira	711788239246528513	2016-03-21T05:35:15	DavidJMurray4 &gt;players/Union are consulted first at the combine in February. Players don't have the a say in the final vote.
MikePereira	711787481897832448	2016-03-21T05:32:14	escobar_ken &gt;pesky escy if I recall. Good to hear from you. Hope you are well. Great days at SCU.
MikePereira	711754250611777536	2016-03-21T03:20:11	Really looking forward to sharing the story. Thank you for the comment.  
MikePereira	711744206650396672	2016-03-21T02:40:17	naterider52 &gt;You made my day. So looking forward to meeting you. We both have Nikki to thank for this.
MikePereira	711734448220413956	2016-03-21T02:01:30	naterider52 &gt; Great to hear about your optimistic outlook. I will have a chair for you that is right next to mine on a Sunday at Fox.
MikePereira	711728250104504320	2016-03-21T01:36:52	JoeNFL &gt;it was either you or Buck and Aikman. I think I made the right choice.
MikePereira	711727846100758532	2016-03-21T01:35:16	Not sure if any of the club proposed changes will pass. If proposed by a club it must be presented to owners even if CC doesn't support it.
MikePereira	711726260829999110	2016-03-21T01:28:58	AmyTrask has a book coming out at the same time. Her book will outsell mine.Her insight into the Raiders and football is fascinating.
MikePereira	711725618250043393	2016-03-21T01:26:25	My book? Yes, my book. Going to talk about my life and how it has been affected by health issues and football. Yikes!
MikePereira	711725039410872320	2016-03-21T01:24:07	Missed NikkiRSharp book launch party yesterday. She is going to help me  with ideas when my book comes out in August.
MikePereira	711724083185106946	2016-03-21T01:20:19	Competition Committee had coaches that felt eliminating back side chops would make it hard to run the football. So? This will pass.
MikePereira	711723552765034496	2016-03-21T01:18:12	It is right to eliminate all chop blocks. Dirty play and defensive lineman need protection too. Not many teams employ the technique.
MikePereira	711722680903458816	2016-03-21T01:14:44	Auto ejection is a reaction to two games in my opinion. A kick and punch are ejections the first time it happens. Fraught with problems.
MikePereira	711721911181582339	2016-03-21T01:11:41	Time to start tweeting. Rule changes coming. For once, I agree with Richard Sherman. Two personal fouls, auto ejection? Not needed.
MikePereira	709748608506183681	2016-03-15T14:30:29	TVsMikeNelson &gt;Incomplete. Two teeth came off the ball when the ball touched the floor. Didn't complete the process. ðŸ¤“
MikePereira	696534393033129984	2016-02-08T03:21:54	Sloppy game. Story is on the teams and not the officials which is as it should be. Good job by Blakeman and crew. Good night all.
MikePereira	696510363920039938	2016-02-08T01:46:25	carlfmartinjr &gt;Because they made a first down on the pay.
MikePereira	696503564600934400	2016-02-08T01:19:24	JDSCHOLL19 &gt;Nope. It was outside of one minute.
MikePereira	696493285456482304	2016-02-08T00:38:34	He is down. Thumb touched the leg. If towel only not down.
MikePereira	696487460163887104	2016-02-08T00:15:25	Sketchy service here. Looked like the tip of the ball may have touched the ground before he rolled over Watch it slow. Cant overturn.
MikePereira	696483073873965056	2016-02-07T23:57:59	JoeNFL footballzebras &gt;proof positive you are a pain in the butt, Joe.
MikePereira	696480769191972864	2016-02-07T23:48:50	FZelkowitz &gt;Correct.
MikePereira	696479027687723008	2016-02-07T23:41:54	FZelkowitz &gt;yes if the team with the choice is to take the ball.
MikePereira	696474906913996800	2016-02-07T23:25:32	sir_tonycapone &gt;Tony....I haven't been in Santa Clara in two weeks. Sure you don't have me confused with someone.
MikePereira	696469639769948160	2016-02-07T23:04:36	Best of luck to Clete Blackman and his officiating crew. I be watching...from a friends house with a drink in my hand.
MikePereira	696468965145444352	2016-02-07T23:01:55	sir_tonycapone &gt;Tony...I never refuse a pic. When was this? If your Grandfather is in the area, I will come to him.
MikePereira	695720414769623040	2016-02-05T21:27:27	We can't believe these 3 ref signals are real - but MikePereira tells KristenBalboni THEY ARE! 
MikePereira	695716964824580096	2016-02-05T21:13:44	According to MikePereira, there could be two more female officials in the NFL soon. 
MikePereira	691637129596637184	2016-01-25T15:01:56	A worthy honor presented by a very special person. Proud to call you both friends.  
MikePereira	691502676056473600	2016-01-25T06:07:40	Clete Blakeman is your SB50 referee.  My KFC Postgame Fill Up: 
MikePereira	691450614392336384	2016-01-25T02:40:47	chuckhable &gt; you are correct
MikePereira	691447847791697920	2016-01-25T02:29:48	georgehollen &gt; it was
MikePereira	691441974646304768	2016-01-25T02:06:27	Should have been a late hit on that last play
MikePereira	691441177267011584	2016-01-25T02:03:17	jppalmCBS &gt; referee deems if they have enough time to match up. No set limit
MikePereira	691440474012274692	2016-01-25T02:00:30	Carolina had to call a time out because the Panthers substituted late and AZ gets a chance to match
MikePereira	691437525911535616	2016-01-25T01:48:47	nkvdo &gt; no rule in NFL says he has to...
MikePereira	691434281785126912	2016-01-25T01:35:53	joefrl &gt; foot was IN but knee hit first
MikePereira	691428828380397569	2016-01-25T01:14:13	Unusual penalty but the defense had 7 on the line on one side of the center. Can only have 6. Good alert call
MikePereira	691428190913372160	2016-01-25T01:11:41	That's a touchdown for Cam
MikePereira	691428019034918912	2016-01-25T01:11:00	I just looked at the super slow mo and the confirmation took long because they were looking at defender. His knee in bounds and foot wasn't
MikePereira	691427596710518784	2016-01-25T01:09:19	Scrapper505 &gt; I just looked on super slow mo. It was close but his knee was in bounds and foot was not out of bounds
MikePereira	691422935244894208	2016-01-25T00:50:48	Good call. Grabbed the face mask and turned the head
MikePereira	691418956251267072	2016-01-25T00:34:59	A lot of people asking about Fitzgerald pass...doesn't just apply to QB. In NFL any passer
MikePereira	691416277898829824	2016-01-25T00:24:21	BrianRTowle &gt; it applies to any player who passes the ball behind the line of scrimmage in the NFL
MikePereira	691415896141631488	2016-01-25T00:22:50	Fitzgerald was considered out if the pocket
MikePereira	691414831690153985	2016-01-25T00:18:36	Egg_Burger &gt;he's not exempt from any rules.
MikePereira	691414484095672320	2016-01-25T00:17:13	ErikDWeis &gt;yes, anywhere between the hash marks
MikePereira	691412268915912704	2016-01-25T00:08:25	Arians complaining about his receiver Brown being hit from behind and he's right. Should have been a foul
MikePereira	691411345200119809	2016-01-25T00:04:45	Very generous spot on the first down. I would have challenged that...
MikePereira	691410784371474433	2016-01-25T00:02:31	Not enough for personal foul. Not enough forceable contact
MikePereira	691409578232119296	2016-01-24T23:57:43	Ericschapters &gt;because we knew we had one coming after FG
MikePereira	691409039909990400	2016-01-24T23:55:35	Time out is 30 secs because it wasn't a tv timeout
MikePereira	691401523184672768	2016-01-24T23:25:43	My view from the Fox booth. Getting ready for the game. 
MikePereira	691400947281502209	2016-01-24T23:23:26	dmao79 &gt;yes ...was on the field. Back in booth now
MikePereira	689285925432471552	2016-01-19T03:19:05	dez_mobley &gt;&gt;I went to Stagg, Dez. It was a long time ago..
MikePereira	689285527799861248	2016-01-19T03:17:30	Figures it is the officials fault  the Cavs are getting smoked.  
MikePereira	689284451088482304	2016-01-19T03:13:14	Starting our descent into Sacramento. Time to shut it down. Thanks for the entertainment. Are the Warriors really killing the Cavs?
MikePereira	689283144592142338	2016-01-19T03:08:02	TetreaultPaul &gt;&gt;Can I find it on line?
MikePereira	689282581896888320	2016-01-19T03:05:48	bbkld5 &gt;&gt;Deal. Used to go to the Basque festival in Los Banos.
MikePereira	689282334281969664	2016-01-19T03:04:49	TetreaultPaul &gt;&gt;I ordered Gaspars and it was great. Had it shipped to Sacramento.
MikePereira	689281834144800768	2016-01-19T03:02:50	JSutel &gt;&gt;It was more of a dive to avoid a hit and he got right up. They were right to not rule him down as giving himelf up.
MikePereira	689281448969306114	2016-01-19T03:01:18	SebastianNoel47 &gt;&gt;Another solid reason even better than mine.
MikePereira	689281277162164225	2016-01-19T03:00:37	bbkld5 &gt;&gt;I am half portuguese and half Basque. How about that!

MikePereira	689280139796975616	2016-01-19T02:56:06	ediddy1978 &gt;&gt;I heard some people talk about it but I saw nothing wrong. The ball came lose when Ben hit the ground.
MikePereira	689279683775467520	2016-01-19T02:54:17	unc9803 &gt;&gt;&gt;I think the reverse. I don't think they would send him there twice in a row. May be wrong, though
MikePereira	689279271198523392	2016-01-19T02:52:39	My man Nick Canepa. Bet most of my followers have no idea what linguica is.... 
MikePereira	689278613233926146	2016-01-19T02:50:02	wheels351972 &gt;&gt;not sure it has been decided. I would think either Corrente or Blakeman.
MikePereira	689278344865525760	2016-01-19T02:48:58	ICBsports &gt;&gt;nuts and bolts came loose when it hit the ground. Ended up taking the same plane out of there.
MikePereira	689278062421082112	2016-01-19T02:47:50	MattSchafer1974 &gt;&gt;He has.
MikePereira	689277995882696704	2016-01-19T02:47:35	JBackAttack &gt;&gt;I think so.
MikePereira	689277845655293952	2016-01-19T02:46:59	seanmrivers &gt;&gt;About a little over an hour away.
MikePereira	689277380297293825	2016-01-19T02:45:08	And Friday it is back to Charlotte. I think the referee is going to be either Hochuli or Vinovich. More likely Vinovich I think.
MikePereira	689277082140975105	2016-01-19T02:43:57	First for me today. Hustling off a plane that was filling with smoke. That is how my day started in Charlotte. We were still at the gate.
MikePereira	689276029362307072	2016-01-19T02:39:46	cgriffingolf griff5sara &gt;&gt;Wish you would have said something to me or maybe you did and I was asleep. Charlotte to Houston??
MikePereira	688856898209071107	2016-01-17T22:54:17	David_LaTorre &gt;&gt;Clearly an incomplete pass. No need to hold whistle.
MikePereira	688846079442354176	2016-01-17T22:11:18	Great job by Corrente's crew SEAvsCAR - don't be surprised if he works Super Bowl 50  My kfc Postgame Fill Up:

MikePereira	688828048305569793	2016-01-17T20:59:39	Very close but with the back foot dragging I don't see them overturning this. I would leave a catch
MikePereira	688823092706029568	2016-01-17T20:39:57	I think that's a catch plus he held on to the ball when he hit the ground. Right toe does appear to touch after looking at the replay
MikePereira	688819579288600576	2016-01-17T20:26:00	hipsterwannabe &gt; no halo rule...can't make contact or take away his path to the ball
MikePereira	688819390163255296	2016-01-17T20:25:14	mikedairyguy &gt;I just looked at it again on replay -- forearm was down
MikePereira	688813832832077824	2016-01-17T20:03:09	That's a touchdown
MikePereira	688812702722998272	2016-01-17T19:58:40	I talked with Tony Corrente before the game and he wanted mortreport's phone number to offer support. He's stage 4 throat cancer survivor

MikePereira	688584754074009601	2016-01-17T04:52:53	I don't agree with those that say OT rules need to change. You give up a TD, you lose. Reward the team if they score a TD.
MikePereira	688584139436494851	2016-01-17T04:50:26	Logic would dictate you reflip the coin. If you show  them the coin and then try to flip it, it needs to flip. Arizona won both flips.
MikePereira	688580034190180353	2016-01-17T04:34:08	The coin flip is like icing on the cake. How weird is this game.
MikePereira	688579841050808320	2016-01-17T04:33:21	I also think it was DPI on the incomplete pass when the Packer player tried to make the catch.
MikePereira	688579615506317312	2016-01-17T04:32:28	The receiver was drive blocking downfield. Have to make this call based on that shot. Would like to see the all-22 tape.
MikePereira	688579118653296640	2016-01-17T04:30:29	So much more to talk about. Based on the shot that was shown quickly, I was offensive PI on the Arizona TD pass to Floyd.
MikePereira	688578677789966336	2016-01-17T04:28:44	This is close but for all that Cris pointed out, don't feel you can overturn it.
MikePereira	688577911633227776	2016-01-17T04:25:41	So much to talk about. Not a runoff because they were set and then the receiver went in motion. If you are set first it is not a false start

MikePereira	688527368999157760	2016-01-17T01:04:51	Lets hope for a similar performance by Clete Blakeman and his crew in Arizona. Blakeman a former QB at Nebraska.
MikePereira	688527108335796224	2016-01-17T01:03:49	Also, the tackle out of bounds of Smith was not a foul. The contact started in bounds and the tackle was all one action.
MikePereira	688526755582193664	2016-01-17T01:02:25	Good job by a young referee, Craig Wrolstad and his crew. He is in his second year as a ref. Was not grounding and that is not reveiwable.

MikePereira	688515999511887872	2016-01-17T00:19:40	It is incomplete. The ball came out just after the second foot came down. Did not become a runner.
MikePereira	688514711109898240	2016-01-17T00:14:33	That was not illegal contact. The ball was in the air. Not DPI either. Both playing and looking at the ball. No foul either way.

MikePereira	688504820219559936	2016-01-16T23:35:15	Although I didn't see it, the League has emphasized that the officials are to shut down the play if the officials are not in position.
MikePereira	688503523412058112	2016-01-16T23:30:06	Let me know what the decision is?

MikePereira	688497982056972288	2016-01-16T23:08:05	mitchjj53 TomColeman12 &gt;&gt;Different rule. Rule allows you to spike the ball to stop the clock as long as you do it immediatley.

MikePereira	688492309856436225	2016-01-16T22:45:32	By the way, touching the plyon does not put you out of bounds. I think it might have been a TD but it was not indisputable. Stands was right
MikePereira	688491862236114944	2016-01-16T22:43:46	Same type of play last week in Washington. No foot in the EZ so the ball has to get over or inside of pylon. interesting what other shots.
MikePereira	688491235019866112	2016-01-16T22:41:16	Ball has to get over or inside the pylon
MikePereira	688490810824732673	2016-01-16T22:39:35	Roughing the call was right. 2 step rule. If contact comes after the second step comes down after the release, it is a foul.
MikePereira	688490262377582592	2016-01-16T22:37:24	Interesting that even though it says kickoff player, he would get  the same protection. He is clearly defenseless.
MikePereira	688489793416658944	2016-01-16T22:35:32	The rule says,"a kickoff or punt returner" get the protection. Kicking team player is defenseless if he is trying to catch the kick.
MikePereira	688482948509634560	2016-01-16T22:08:20	All signs point to Hochuli and Vinovich as the referees in the Championship games. Looks like Blakeman or Corrente in the Super Bowl.
MikePereira	688482490416156672	2016-01-16T22:06:31	Referees tomorrow are Corente in Carolina and McAulay in Denver.
MikePereira	688481544659320832	2016-01-16T22:02:46	Sorry, Dan but that was not roughing the passer. Normal tackle and not late, Did not lift and drive him into the ground.

MikePereira	686027538611716096	2016-01-10T03:31:25	ActionBenz &gt;True, Action, but his hand is on the ball the whole time.
MikePereira	686027246419705857	2016-01-10T03:30:15	M4rtyFunkhouser &gt;&gt;Even your buttocks.
MikePereira	686026684693364736	2016-01-10T03:28:02	Going to be interesting what other shots show. Control is gained by pinning the ball against any part of the body.
MikePereira	686026358418501632	2016-01-10T03:26:44	Catch?? I would like to see what they are looking at during the commerical but it appears a catch to me. Right hand stays on the ball.
MikePereira	686024524916244480	2016-01-10T03:19:27	msjmcglynn RochieWBZ &gt;&gt;The defender can do it too. Neither can grab, and twist, turn, or pull on the mask. Different in line play.
MikePereira	686021778951389184	2016-01-10T03:08:32	MikePereira TitosVodka That's a 15 yard penalty for not having Titos within reach at all times during a playoff game. Not reviewable.
MikePereira	686022547201196032	2016-01-10T03:11:35	Back to the play...in replay all personal fouls and unsportsmanlike fouls carry over just as they would after any play is over. Others don't
MikePereira	686020924768972800	2016-01-10T03:05:08	TitosVodka caused me to miss this play live. Came down to the bar for a drink.
MikePereira	686020607675383808	2016-01-10T03:03:53	Penalty still stands even if defender is ruled down.
MikePereira	686015074989928448	2016-01-10T02:41:54	I actually think he had the ball long enough to protect himself as he braced to the contact. He becomes  a runner at that point.
MikePereira	686014432821030914	2016-01-10T02:39:20	Simms is right, it was close but to me he turns his head and the contact with the shoulder to the head was slight. Better not calling that.
MikePereira	686011994248445952	2016-01-10T02:29:39	I would exchange my 5 lottery quick picks for a $10 bet on the under.
MikePereira	686010670622633985	2016-01-10T02:24:23	b0bfather &gt;&gt;4 against Pittsburgh and 5 against Cincinnati. Yep, that is one sided. You are all over it, Bobby.
MikePereira	686009965409087489	2016-01-10T02:21:35	You are seeing the definition of what it means call a game tight to keep control of the game.
MikePereira	686009152322289666	2016-01-10T02:18:22	trufitrs34 &gt;&gt;Replay was able to confirm that the call was right. No need to stop the game.
MikePereira	686007901488570368	2016-01-10T02:13:23	Back of the wrist does not put you down. It is part of the hand. Have to get to the forearem. Looks like a fumble unless other shots come.
MikePereira	686006338015617024	2016-01-10T02:07:11	a_quality_guy &gt;&gt;They have stuff to wear also but not sure it is the same stuff the players get. I wore a wet suit once for a cold game.
MikePereira	686005926910902272	2016-01-10T02:05:33	rmd81064 &gt;&gt;Not a BS call, RCL, but you are entitled to your BS opinion.
MikePereira	686005389679263744	2016-01-10T02:03:24	baseballchump11 &gt;&gt;That was a live ball foul during the play. It was not a dead ball foul in the action after the play.
MikePereira	686005189409640448	2016-01-10T02:02:37	FZelkowitz &gt;&gt;didn't see it, Fred. We had our production meeting. Hope you are well.
MikePereira	686004443066810368	2016-01-10T01:59:39	rmd81064 &gt;&gt;He grabbed him by the arm and swung him around. Are you watching the game on your phone?
MikePereira	686003645813526528	2016-01-10T01:56:29	magrampip &gt;&gt;I agree but they(competition committee) felt that penalty would be too severe.
MikePereira	686003346294083584	2016-01-10T01:55:17	DCNC70 &gt;&gt;Why wouldn't it be? If you hold during the kick it is a foul. You don't wait to see if the ball is fair caught.
MikePereira	686003016592396288	2016-01-10T01:53:59	JoeM3120 &gt;&gt;Nope.
MikePereira	686002456317300736	2016-01-10T01:51:45	JakeBartelson &gt;&gt;You got it, Jake.
MikePereira	686002106625572864	2016-01-10T01:50:22	JakeBartelson &gt;&gt;Not true. He grabbed and pulled him by the arm.
MikePereira	686001636167258112	2016-01-10T01:48:30	Dead ball fouls after the first down is made are penalized after the play but the down and distance is  first and 10 by rule.
MikePereira	686000378001887236	2016-01-10T01:43:30	I stand corrected. It was Neil Smith that led to the delay of game defense penalty.
MikePereira	685999812114812928	2016-01-10T01:41:15	cireksu21 &gt;&gt;i think you are right.
MikePereira	685999614181388288	2016-01-10T01:40:27	sportsgod00 &gt;&gt;He was great. Agree, Mark.
MikePereira	685999317581168641	2016-01-10T01:39:17	Those asking about lauching...It is only a foul if you lead with the crown or make contact to the head or neck area. Launching is not a foul
MikePereira	685998930967007232	2016-01-10T01:37:45	Perfectly legal hit on a defenseless receiver. Did not lead with the crown of the helmet and did not make contact in the head or neck area.
MikePereira	685998601428951040	2016-01-10T01:36:26	Defense cannot flinch by doing something that is a non-football act trying to draw a false start. Derick Thomas started this.
MikePereira	685997980978122752	2016-01-10T01:33:58	Have to shut that down before the snap. Harrison flinched three times trying to draw a false start. That is delay on the defense.
MikePereira	685997239802675200	2016-01-10T01:31:01	John Parry had these 2 teams in week 14. A bit unusual to have them again now. Crew is made of 3 of this guys and 4 from other crews.
MikePereira	685996687609978880	2016-01-10T01:28:50	Good call for interference. Cannot  take away the receivers path to the ball.
MikePereira	685995426282115072	2016-01-10T01:23:49	Pat downs occur before the start of the second half also.
MikePereira	685995014254669824	2016-01-10T01:22:11	applesarenice1 &gt;&gt;No penalty. Jersey is confiscated and he must replace it.
MikePereira	685994112756150273	2016-01-10T01:18:36	Pat down before the game? That is a random check that is done b4 every game checking for any slippery substance on jersies. 4 players a team
MikePereira	685993372381765632	2016-01-10T01:15:39	Just got back to the room. Sounds like things went pretty well in the first game in terms of officiating.
MikePereira	685957640707518464	2016-01-09T22:53:40	I've got to go to our production meeting. Be back in a while.
MikePereira	685957459974991873	2016-01-09T22:52:57	The still pics of the sideline catch does not show when he got clear control. That is why still pics are rarely used in replay.
MikePereira	685956422258044928	2016-01-09T22:48:50	mbgolf1974 &gt;&gt;I disagree, Mark. Look at the pictures being sent it. It was close but the toe was up when he got total control.
MikePereira	685955849563582464	2016-01-09T22:46:33	Good job my crew. It was close but I agree. You all are one for one.
MikePereira	685955647976927237	2016-01-09T22:45:45	Most say no catch. I think I agree. Looks like it is up.
MikePereira	685955223857328130	2016-01-09T22:44:04	In a hotel with no DVR. You make the call for me.
MikePereira	685955110535598081	2016-01-09T22:43:37	Was the back foot up when he first got control?
MikePereira	685954750416875520	2016-01-09T22:42:11	PaulJunio &gt;&gt;Legit suggestion, Paul.
MikePereira	685954523014262784	2016-01-09T22:41:17	I have the best Twitter crew in the world. He is referring to the rubber pellets.  
MikePereira	685953986126581762	2016-01-09T22:39:09	Luke5377 &gt;&gt;Nope, they are all over the field.
MikePereira	685953717322051587	2016-01-09T22:38:05	JeffSechelski &gt;&gt;The defensive holding penalty would then be put back on.
MikePereira	685952940406902784	2016-01-09T22:35:00	Rubber pellets showed the toe drag at the sideline. Very good call by the Line judge. Tight play. Love those pellets.
MikePereira	685950935386992641	2016-01-09T22:27:02	samcouvillon &gt;&gt; Thanks, Sam. I you will find it both entertaining and informative.
MikePereira	685949852447051776	2016-01-09T22:22:43	samcouvillon &gt;&gt;Weather not a factor and yes, all are considered equal.

MikePereira	685946260956823552	2016-01-09T22:08:27	ClemensBZiegler &gt;&gt;really good question. I am going to assume they are.  No cracks about what assumes means.

MikePereira	685938527838814208	2016-01-09T21:37:43	Ron Torbert is the referee in Houston. He has not had Houston this year and had the Chiefs in Week 4 when they lost to Cin 36-21

MikePereira	685935281338454016	2016-01-09T21:24:49	NFL has not released the officials for next week. Most likely the SB officials will come from those 4 games.
MikePereira	685934841565675520	2016-01-09T21:23:04	Boger and Allen. All are working this week as on the field or as an alternate.
MikePereira	685934656806612992	2016-01-09T21:22:20	Any thoughts on who the ref wll be in Super Bowl 50? Eliminate the names Torbert, Parry, Coleman, Steratore, Hussey, Triplette, and......

MikePereira	682771591487340544	2016-01-01T03:53:27	To those tweeting me,forget it. New Years Eve dinner with a big group of friends is a lot more exciting than this game. Happy New Year.
MikePereira	682770509440757760	2016-01-01T03:49:09	LindseyThiry ã€‹Enjoying myself at a New  Years Eve party, Lindsey. It's a lot more interesting than this game.
MikePereira	682675550574383104	2015-12-31T21:31:49	Jacob_Berger22 &gt;&gt;Hope you have a happy and healthy New Year, Jacob.

MikePereira	682671568346976256	2015-12-31T21:15:59	If the ball lands in the white border, it is not going to be called uncatchable. That was interference. Orange Bowl.
MikePereira	681699587992731648	2015-12-29T04:53:41	Right to let that stand. Very close. It was an either way decision. That is what stands means.
MikePereira	681678627348582400	2015-12-29T03:30:24	Nobody will convince me otherwise. I don't like it. The rules don't allow that. I know it is about getting it right but....
MikePereira	681678265950552064	2015-12-29T03:28:58	For those asking about the facemask, the input had to come from somewhere else. Had to be replay and it is not reviewable.
MikePereira	681660112499511296	2015-12-29T02:16:50	rsportgod &gt;&gt;If this is the play that #74 reported, it was an illegal formation. He was covered by the wide receiver.
MikePereira	681623853064425472	2015-12-28T23:52:45	goBears74 &gt;&gt;yes, but why would they. The offense would get to replay the down. Defense can't gain anything.
MikePereira	681285412367695872	2015-12-28T01:27:54	Terry McAulay, the NFL Referees Association, and an unfortunate situation.  My KFC Postgame Fill Up: 
MikePereira	681272042969149440	2015-12-28T00:34:47	Fisher is right, all 11 players not set before the ball was snapped. They correctly turned it into a false start &amp; 10 sec. run off STLvsSEA
MikePereira	681267236728750080	2015-12-28T00:15:41	No safety in GBvsAZ because the ball was completely out of the end zone when he was first contacted by the defense
MikePereira	681266175062466560	2015-12-28T00:11:28	bigdawg777 &gt;&gt;Baldwin's was inside of two minutes.
MikePereira	681263776713306112	2015-12-28T00:01:56	BeastQuake &gt;That only pertains to fumbles on 4th down or inside of two minutes of either half.
MikePereira	681261299083247616	2015-12-27T23:52:05	Seahawks cannot challenge... they've already lost 2. Even if they had a challenge, it would have stayed as a Rams recovery STLvsSEA
MikePereira	681258612061163520	2015-12-27T23:41:24	Clear helmet to helmet hit on Rodgers... He was In the pocket, and still considered a passer GBvsAZ
MikePereira	681258122720067584	2015-12-27T23:39:28	He has control, two feet, but he's hit before he's able to complete the process. I think it will be an incomplete pass. STLvsSEA
MikePereira	681256454800584704	2015-12-27T23:32:50	meggranito No, it's snapped right as it hits 0. And there is a slight delay on the clock
MikePereira	681256002751168512	2015-12-27T23:31:02	Bronco5668 &gt;&gt;It would not. Treated just like grabbing a handful of hair.
MikePereira	681253952856305664	2015-12-27T23:22:54	No horse-collar tackle on Rodgers' fumble.. and it doesn't apply anyway to a quarterback in the pocket GBvsAZ
MikePereira	681251810926002180	2015-12-27T23:14:23	RonBevi &gt;&gt;not when his foot hits the goal line. Since it does, the goal line extends outside the sideline.
MikePereira	681250973591801856	2015-12-27T23:11:03	Good roughing the passer call in Seattle... it was a late hit, he had plenty of time to let up STLvsSEA
MikePereira	681235821081444352	2015-12-27T22:10:51	costa1360  No, it's legal
MikePereira	681235760209502208	2015-12-27T22:10:36	TheRebelYinzer  Yes, it's legal
MikePereira	681232041124347904	2015-12-27T21:55:49	Lots of confusion in NEvsNYJ - but did Clete Blakeman do anything wrong in OT?   No.   My KFC Midday Fill Up 
MikePereira	681231676744192000	2015-12-27T21:54:23	NickHeidke No it's doesn't
MikePereira	681227355541483520	2015-12-27T21:37:12	And it was not pass interference in Arizona, the contact came right when the ball arrived. It was a bang-bang play GBvsAZ
