vpostrel	700140761401073664	2016-02-18T02:12:20	samtanenhaus People don‚Äôt like him. But if you can‚Äôt tell the difference btw him &amp; Trump I have to think you‚Äôre blinded by political views.

vpostrel	700138773275766784	2016-02-18T02:04:26	samtanenhaus There are also all the social cons who support him. Lots of policy there.
vpostrel	700138698403237890	2016-02-18T02:04:08	samtanenhaus You‚Äôre confusing opposition and denial. If Trump wants ideas, he can tap think tanks. But he doesn‚Äôt want them.

vpostrel	700137846078738432	2016-02-18T02:00:45	samtanenhaus Republican wonks accept that Trump is serious. As Ebola is serious. Doesn‚Äôt mean they want to encourage him.
vpostrel	700137704911036416	2016-02-18T02:00:11	samtanenhaus But it could be projection. I‚Äôm a GOP-leaning independent. Will vote HRC if Trump is nominee. (Not even stay home as in 2008.)
vpostrel	700137694630785024	2016-02-18T02:00:08	samtanenhaus There are some.
vpostrel	700137326328942592	2016-02-18T01:58:41	samtanenhaus In other words, I think serious GOP wonks will just bolt the party if Trump is the nominee.
vpostrel	700137085424959492	2016-02-18T01:57:43	samtanenhaus As Bob Solow used to say, when a man says he‚Äôs Napoleon you don‚Äôt start engaging him about cavalry tactics at Waterloo.

vpostrel	700136794914881536	2016-02-18T01:56:34	samtanenhaus Cruz voters definitely want policy. Some Rubio voters do.

vpostrel	700135326572871680	2016-02-18T01:50:44	samtanenhaus Also policy wonks are justifiably appalled by the idea of a Trump presidency and don‚Äôt want to do anything to encourage it.
vpostrel	700134893070647297	2016-02-18T01:49:01	samtanenhaus There are plenty of idea people who present ideas in general, not to specific campaigns. Why associate w/ Trump?

vpostrel	700134069183483904	2016-02-18T01:45:44	samtanenhaus Unlikely. Trump doesn‚Äôt want ideas from anybody but himself.
