nickconfessore	714600707245142016	2016-03-28T23:50:59	swinshi I suppose we could listen to his message and conclude from the voting that people like it, but that could just be more punditry.
nickconfessore	714583789817708545	2016-03-28T22:43:46	.nickconfessore here's my view: 
nickconfessore	714579418623115264	2016-03-28T22:26:24	Great piece by nickconfessore on how an ideologically frozen GOP lost sight of its own voters: 
nickconfessore	714579400193343488	2016-03-28T22:26:19	"Pretend" is a great typo here Jimmy.  
nickconfessore	714565629538344961	2016-03-28T21:31:36	nickconfessore Obama is trying to govern a nation. Republicans are trying to avoid a primary. Clinton is trying to win an election.
nickconfessore	714575188202008576	2016-03-28T22:09:35	gregpinelo Obama may have. Clinton just unboxed them.
nickconfessore	714570513855737857	2016-03-28T21:51:01	"Damn you Cohagen, give de people da air." 
nickconfessore	714563727211773952	2016-03-28T21:24:03	Obama: the Court pick is about the senate doing its job. Senate Rs: no, it's about precedent. Clinton, nah, it's about power.
nickconfessore	714562977261858816	2016-03-28T21:21:04	But it seems off message vis a vis the Obama admin.
nickconfessore	714562849494982656	2016-03-28T21:20:33	Clinton is plainly (and accurately) saying the court pick is about whose ideology wins while the Rs hide behind fig leaf of precedent.
nickconfessore	714557879039180801	2016-03-28T21:00:48	Yup. People are complicated. 
nickconfessore	714547665187573761	2016-03-28T20:20:13	RadioFreeTom This is usually how politics works. A politician explains that A and B are connected and people believe them.
nickconfessore	714547502893150209	2016-03-28T20:19:34	RadioFreeTom I don't think it's a fake issue. Some people are better off because of trade and some people are out of jobs.

nickconfessore	714541948841902080	2016-03-28T19:57:30	danieltroy BrucePurple jpodhoretz I think reformicon ideas largely crowded out on Hill by tax cuts, immigration, Obamacare.

nickconfessore	714538609999802368	2016-03-28T19:44:14	swinshi I guess more importantly-do you really think they are unrelated?

nickconfessore	714537702025203713	2016-03-28T19:40:38	mikeparanzino I think that is true--but Dems have handled their insurgency better.
nickconfessore	714536945679015936	2016-03-28T19:37:37	Thanks Chris! 
nickconfessore	714536824908214273	2016-03-28T19:37:09	RadioFreeTom why does it have to be either/or? By definition we ignore an issue until something or someone makes us pay attention.
nickconfessore	714534933163819009	2016-03-28T19:29:38	swinshi I do not disagree. I also don't think my story was punditry.
nickconfessore	714533544190722048	2016-03-28T19:24:06	One simple (though to my mind overlapping) explanation is that GOP leaders overpromised and underdelivered on spending and Obamacare.
nickconfessore	714533187414720512	2016-03-28T19:22:41	But maybe I'm wrong. Plenty of room for other explanations and interpretations, some of briefly touched on and some unmentioned in my story.
nickconfessore	714532695481663488	2016-03-28T19:20:44	ruggkes I'm certainly an elite by any reasonable definition of the term.
nickconfessore	714532086145794050	2016-03-28T19:18:19	My point is less that GOP elites "should have seen it coming" (I sure didn't!) than to piece together the raw materials of Trumpism.
nickconfessore	714531649703297028	2016-03-28T19:16:35	nickconfessore For that matter, most Republicans weren't looking for an outsider until after Trump's candidacy caught on...
nickconfessore	714531471491522561	2016-03-28T19:15:52	Few ranked trade or big money in politics highly as an issue concern--until two compelling candidates made the case for why it should be.
nickconfessore	714531201449652224	2016-03-28T19:14:48	Polls asking voters to rank issues they care about can be misleading. Politics is dynamic and leadership/authenticity matters a lot.

nickconfessore	714484767908040704	2016-03-28T16:10:17	Roan_onHorton Some of the same--I think Dems, after Occupy, responded in a more significant way to similar impatience among own voters.
