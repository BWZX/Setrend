HadleyFreeman	722376333209309184	2016-04-19T10:48:33	devandersons No, I said it's been coopted by a certain kind of feminism
HadleyFreeman	722376132293750784	2016-04-19T10:47:45	BarristerHottie jiatolentino NosheenIqbal No one's claiming it's an original subject. As both Jia and I say it's a popular issue now
HadleyFreeman	722374670515847170	2016-04-19T10:41:57	BarristerHottie jiatolentino NosheenIqbal Are you alleging plagiarism? A legal expert like yourself would know to proceed w/ caution
HadleyFreeman	722374367208988672	2016-04-19T10:40:44	BarristerHottie jiatolentino NosheenIqbal Perhaps, although, as I said, I wrote mine before Jia's piece was published.
HadleyFreeman	722373966371909633	2016-04-19T10:39:09	devandersons Please show me where in the piece I claim otherwise.

HadleyFreeman	722373201850953728	2016-04-19T10:36:07	SexWorkerOU No, I said the concept of "empowerment" has nthg to do with feminism now. The piece does v much.

HadleyFreeman	722372820764925960	2016-04-19T10:34:36	BarristerHottie jiatolentino If yr accusing me of plagiarism talk to my editor NosheenIqbal who commissioned me b4 Jias's piece was pubd
HadleyFreeman	722372335697833984	2016-04-19T10:32:40	SexWorkerOU Are you talking about the feature? It's not about SW or shopping so I'm afraid I have no idea what you're referring to
HadleyFreeman	722371769378676736	2016-04-19T10:30:25	BarristerHottie jiatolentino They really aren't, but if you bothered to read mine you'd see I quote and link to Jia's piece
HadleyFreeman	722371458945708032	2016-04-19T10:29:11	SexWorkerOU Why would you say that? I've not been rude to you, I'm not sure why you're making me out to be a shopping ditz
HadleyFreeman	722371307501928448	2016-04-19T10:28:35	SexWorkerOU No. As you know better than anyone, there is a lot of discussion around these days if they are "empowering"

HadleyFreeman	722368491668533248	2016-04-19T10:17:24	SexWorkerOU It's got nothing to do with feminism, as I think I make clear in the piece. "Empower" is a meaningless word now.

HadleyFreeman	722368161010552832	2016-04-19T10:16:05	SexWorkerOU I never said that sex workers are bad at feminism. That is a very odd claim to put in my mouth.
HadleyFreeman	722367717794308096	2016-04-19T10:14:19	SexWorkerOU No, I said that people "who query whether prostitution is empowering get shouted down as anti-sex harridans."
HadleyFreeman	722367400470036481	2016-04-19T10:13:03	SexWorkerOU I'm afraid I have no idea why you're yelling at me. None of these issues were discussed in my piece.

HadleyFreeman	722053999126585344	2016-04-18T13:27:43	MichaelWolffNYC Unending gleeful retweeting of praise? I'm not Nancy Mitford but, yes, I'd call that repulsive.

HadleyFreeman	722053299504066560	2016-04-18T13:24:56	stevenpoole MichaelWolffNYC I'd say frantic RTs of praise are self-publicity of a different order than mere writing.
HadleyFreeman	722053132038103040	2016-04-18T13:24:16	MichaelWolffNYC How can I make this clearer? It's not covering the story that's the problem, it's your online behaviour that's repulsive
HadleyFreeman	722052748670320640	2016-04-18T13:22:45	MichaelWolffNYC So for all your 'more in sorrow than in anger' coverage of the paper's travails you don't care about the actual journalists
HadleyFreeman	722052059927855104	2016-04-18T13:20:00	MichaelWolffNYC No, what's vulgar is your constant RTing of praise. I really don't know how I can make this point any clearer to you.

HadleyFreeman	722048789872275457	2016-04-18T13:07:01	CGoodfellowBZ MichaelWolffNYC I did it as a RT first by accident. I rewrote it directly to Michael here 
HadleyFreeman	722047177518903297	2016-04-18T13:00:36	MichaelWolffNYC I get that you want to give Alan a kicking, for some reason. But are you really not embarrassed by all the RTs? Honestly?
HadleyFreeman	722046652807311361	2016-04-18T12:58:31	MichaelWolffNYC Indeed. How nice that the prospect of 100s of unemployed journalists has been a source of exciting self-publicity for you.

HadleyFreeman	716531757131153408	2016-04-03T07:44:18	AshLawrenceRye millihill I'm not sure how you've read my defense of c-sections as an attack on HB but I have things to do now. Bye.
HadleyFreeman	716531585693167620	2016-04-03T07:43:37	AshLawrenceRye millihill Stating a statistic is not denigrating a choice. It's reporting a fact.
HadleyFreeman	716529911180181504	2016-04-03T07:36:57	AshLawrenceRye millihill I don't know how you'd draw that conclusion. The only judgement I discuss is the judgement against c-sections
HadleyFreeman	716529591939104768	2016-04-03T07:35:41	AshLawrenceRye millihill Given that almost half of first time mothers having a HB end up in hsptl I'd say they are fairly representative
HadleyFreeman	716526794611027968	2016-04-03T07:24:34	AshLawrenceRye millihill They do, which is why it's worth refuting their claims
HadleyFreeman	716526097119186945	2016-04-03T07:21:48	AshLawrenceRye millihill That's because it does exist. Just because it's not the majority doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
HadleyFreeman	716525860124299264	2016-04-03T07:20:52	AshLawrenceRye millihill I would hope so. But there is still a very vocal and toxic minority.
HadleyFreeman	716525323983020032	2016-04-03T07:18:44	AshLawrenceRye millihill If you read my piece you'd see many examples. Just because you never experienced it doesn't mean it doesn't exist
HadleyFreeman	716525022500806656	2016-04-03T07:17:32	AshLawrenceRye millihill I never said their feelings were petty. I said it's ridiculous others make them feel like that.

HadleyFreeman	716509649156063232	2016-04-03T06:16:27	Reprobatemum Mother and infant mortality is now negligible in this country, thanks to modern medicine. I recommend reading NICE on this
HadleyFreeman	716509434932019200	2016-04-03T06:15:36	Reprobatemum Actuallu, pain relief a modern invention so no, not necessary. And other women are not you and their experiences are not yours
HadleyFreeman	716508722911166464	2016-04-03T06:12:46	Reprobatemum Only a society lucky enough to not have to worry about mother &amp; infant mortality has the luxury to criticise birth methods
HadleyFreeman	716508260480716800	2016-04-03T06:10:56	Reprobatemum Is pain relief during tooth extraction necessary? Is therapy? There are plenty of things on the NHS that aren't 'necessary'
HadleyFreeman	716507099879108608	2016-04-03T06:06:19	Reprobatemum I honestly don't see how anyone can denigrate anything that has helped millions and millions of women and babies.
HadleyFreeman	716505830825336832	2016-04-03T06:01:16	Reprobatemum Anyone can have an elective c-section on the NHS if they ask their doctor
HadleyFreeman	716505581184544768	2016-04-03T06:00:17	Reprobatemum Where are you getting this evidence? NICE, BPAS, and all other reputable medical groups say they're totally fine
HadleyFreeman	716501488479154176	2016-04-03T05:44:01	skeltridge I don't hate on home birth - I say that quite a few end in emergency c-sections, which is true.

HadleyFreeman	713417472062464005	2016-03-25T17:29:14	SunnyAnderson He didn't not care about his dad - he obviously did. But he was angry with him after his parents' divorce.
HadleyFreeman	713416738419970048	2016-03-25T17:26:19	SunnyAnderson Sure, but I got what he was saying: dropping his surname was less of an insult to his dad than swapping it for his mom's.

HadleyFreeman	713413859160244224	2016-03-25T17:14:53	kenduanevwjr TalibKweli No, he just dropped his surname. Stewart is his middle name.
HadleyFreeman	713413735109500929	2016-03-25T17:14:23	SunnyAnderson TalibKweli I discussed all this with him when I interviewed him

HadleyFreeman	713411432960933890	2016-03-25T17:05:14	TalibKweli I get that Jews are able to hide ethnicity unlike POC. But Stewart's a bad example. Like saying Woody Allen hides his Jewishness
HadleyFreeman	713409905982578688	2016-03-25T16:59:10	SunnyAnderson TalibKweli As he has explained, that would have upset his mother too much. So he just used his middle name.

HadleyFreeman	713407626940452864	2016-03-25T16:50:07	lotyslove TalibKweli Well, no, because he wasn't trying to hide from anti-Semites or 'pass.' He was breaking ties with his father.
HadleyFreeman	713406477470461953	2016-03-25T16:45:33	SunnyAnderson TalibKweli He didn't choose a non-Jewish new name - he just dropped his original surname. "Stewart" is his middle name.
HadleyFreeman	713404119969607680	2016-03-25T16:36:11	lotyslove TalibKweli He didn't take a different name - he dropped his last name after falling out w/ his dad. Stewart's his middle name.
HadleyFreeman	713402611286810625	2016-03-25T16:30:11	TalibKweli I'm not denying Stewart has white privilege. But it is very unfair to suggest he ever hid his Jewishness.
HadleyFreeman	713397535528919040	2016-03-25T16:10:01	TalibKweli He both looks Jewish and has always made references to being Jewish. The suggestion that he has hid his Jewishness is nonsense.
HadleyFreeman	713396719246057473	2016-03-25T16:06:46	TalibKweli But that's not why he changed his name, as he has often said:

HadleyFreeman	713393535165341696	2016-03-25T15:54:07	TalibKweli That's nonsense. He changed his name because he fell out with his dad. He's spoken about this a lot. Nothing to do with religion

HadleyFreeman	712590364939517952	2016-03-23T10:42:36	HilaryK777 micrabam Bpas Well, some women don't want them. But the main thing is cost, which is why the NHS advises against.
HadleyFreeman	712589836620800001	2016-03-23T10:40:30	HilaryK777 Libmoggy micrabam Bpas Why "sad"? There is nothing sad about a happy and healthy mother and new baby, however it arrived.
HadleyFreeman	712589414606745600	2016-03-23T10:38:50	HilaryK777 micrabam Bpas So-called 'natural birth' comes with its own enormous risks.

HadleyFreeman	712580272294854656	2016-03-23T10:02:30	HilaryK777 micrabam Bpas Welllll let's see. It could be there are more older mothers in the area, more higher risk births - many things!

HadleyFreeman	711275154328973312	2016-03-19T19:36:26	RoadToSomePlace WritersofColour In other words, it is literally the opposite of the race card.
HadleyFreeman	711275049110609920	2016-03-19T19:36:01	RoadToSomePlace WritersofColour So, as I wrote, when Judd Apatow tells POC not to feel insulted by racist casting. That's racesplaining.
HadleyFreeman	711274785024638976	2016-03-19T19:34:58	RoadToSomePlace WritersofColour I think you have misunderstood. "Racesplain" refers to white people who tell POC something isn't racist...

HadleyFreeman	707621494386466818	2016-03-09T17:38:05	sradford22 Sure, but privilege gained from these schools is far greater than any pain suffered by abuse for going.

HadleyFreeman	703592060960555008	2016-02-27T14:46:34	@EversfieldJ guardian I have babies to take care of and I'm sure you have responsibilities, too. So now I really am blocking you. Goodbye.
HadleyFreeman	703591863895379968	2016-02-27T14:45:47	@EversfieldJ guardian Jennifer, I'm sure you are a well intentioned person but this conversation is pointless. We aren't going to agree.
HadleyFreeman	703591679341764609	2016-02-27T14:45:03	@EversfieldJ guardian So vernacular is allowed, but not satire. Got it.
HadleyFreeman	703591459270828033	2016-02-27T14:44:10	@EversfieldJ guardian I've replied extensively to your comments about the article for three whole days now. We have nothing more to discuss
HadleyFreeman	703590176036163585	2016-02-27T14:39:04	@EversfieldJ guardian You're the one who referred to me, a grown woman, as "a girl"
HadleyFreeman	703589975691042816	2016-02-27T14:38:16	@EversfieldJ guardian I didn't delete an "abusive tweet" - I deleted one saying I was blocking you as it seemed counterproductive
HadleyFreeman	703589038427660290	2016-02-27T14:34:33	@EversfieldJ guardian What happened to "no real exceptions"? 
HadleyFreeman	703588877752279040	2016-02-27T14:33:55	@EversfieldJ guardian You "can't tweet" me? I've replied to all your tweets for the past 3 days even though I'm on maternity leave.
HadleyFreeman	703586987144581120	2016-02-27T14:26:24	@EversfieldJ guardian "girl"?
HadleyFreeman	703575409129099264	2016-02-27T13:40:23	@EversfieldJ than you do and know the vast majority of them understand satire.
HadleyFreeman	703575273544019968	2016-02-27T13:39:51	@EversfieldJ The best way to fight something, v much including misogyny, is to mock it. I apparently have a higher opinion of my readers
HadleyFreeman	703566106431266816	2016-02-27T13:03:26	@EversfieldJ You're so right - from now on I'll write dumbed down, humourless, bland copy for idiots. THX BBZ
HadleyFreeman	703558228030963712	2016-02-27T12:32:07	@EversfieldJ I'm sure we both have better things to do with our weekend than continue this pointless discussion. I suggest we do them.
HadleyFreeman	703558100075323392	2016-02-27T12:31:37	@EversfieldJ And you still seem unable to grasp the concept of satire. Perhaps a dictionary would help you better than I've done.

HadleyFreeman	703237188583084032	2016-02-26T15:16:25	@EversfieldJ I really don't know how to explain more clearly to you the article is satirising fur wearing, not supporting it. Bye.

HadleyFreeman	703173310494830592	2016-02-26T11:02:36	@EversfieldJ I don't know how I can make this clearer to you. In the 3yrs since I wrote that piece you're the only one who didn't get it.
HadleyFreeman	703173085961125888	2016-02-26T11:01:42	@EversfieldJ You still seem to be labouring under the misapprehension that I'm promoting fur. As I said, I'm satirising those who wear it.
HadleyFreeman	703133124071288832	2016-02-26T08:22:55	boodleoops JonathanHaynes Which is why I think ultimately it comes down to class size, teaching and parental involvement.
HadleyFreeman	703132963559444481	2016-02-26T08:22:16	boodleoops JonathanHaynes I'm speaking as one who was privately educated and saw plenty examples of both kinds of kids in my schools.
HadleyFreeman	703132806310793216	2016-02-26T08:21:39	boodleoops JonathanHaynes so ¬£¬£¬£ you're just as likely to find trust fund kids there who fritter away opportunities and don't strive.
HadleyFreeman	703132553553661954	2016-02-26T08:20:38	boodleoops JonathanHaynes If you mean kids from families who appreciate the value of education then yes, sure. But private schools are now
HadleyFreeman	703130156659912704	2016-02-26T08:11:07	boodleoops JonathanHaynes This is surely more about class size, teaching quality and parenting involvement
HadleyFreeman	703130036421787650	2016-02-26T08:10:38	boodleoops JonathanHaynes I strongly disagree! In my experience privately educated kids are no more conscientious than state school ones

HadleyFreeman	703124440113020928	2016-02-26T07:48:24	@EversfieldJ You really ought to shout at Jonathan Swift now for encouraging cannibalism
HadleyFreeman	703124235447726080	2016-02-26T07:47:35	@EversfieldJ Po-faced means "takes things too seriously", it is not a comment on physical appearance
HadleyFreeman	703002503642816512	2016-02-25T23:43:52	@EversfieldJ You say "justifies", I say "satirises." Really not v hard to grasp. I'm going to bed. Bye.

HadleyFreeman	702997309458612224	2016-02-25T23:23:14	@EversfieldJ You seem v determined to yell about fur. Maybe try someone besides a journalist at The Guardian, a famously anti-fur paper? Bye

HadleyFreeman	701009200529408000	2016-02-20T11:43:12	19Averil joshspero sarahditum To her, it was worth it, and given that she's the one in the marriage that's all that matters.

HadleyFreeman	700988761874833408	2016-02-20T10:21:59	sarahditum I'm not saying I agree with her, or I'd do the same. But I do feel for her. To her, life without him is worse than life with.
HadleyFreeman	700988483318452224	2016-02-20T10:20:52	sarahditum I agree, but 'twas always thus for her, and yet she stayed.
HadleyFreeman	700986961721499648	2016-02-20T10:14:50	sarahditum Well, she's sustained it for 35yrs. It's not many people's idea of happiness, but it's hers
HadleyFreeman	700986744611667968	2016-02-20T10:13:58	bikebird13 MostlyYummy In your view, not hers
HadleyFreeman	700986178376433664	2016-02-20T10:11:43	anyabike sarahditum I feel sad for her, so I'm just glad for her if she feels she got the ending she always wanted.
HadleyFreeman	700985953280778240	2016-02-20T10:10:49	anyabike sarahditum The issue here is objective v subjective. Objectively, she clearly hasn't won. But subjectively, to her, she has
HadleyFreeman	700985617904222208	2016-02-20T10:09:29	sarahditum That would obviously be most people's opinion, but I'm glad, for her sake she feels differently
HadleyFreeman	700985153728991234	2016-02-20T10:07:38	sarahditum Absolutely, and yet she never wavered in her belief that she wanted him. It's abusive, and I think also pretty common.
HadleyFreeman	700984789407498240	2016-02-20T10:06:12	DillyTante saramacgregor BettySC91 Maybe not to you and me, but to her, apparently so
HadleyFreeman	700984656720699392	2016-02-20T10:05:40	sarahditum It's not a choice I'd make, but I'm glad she feels some kind of happiness, after all that misery
HadleyFreeman	700984505444782081	2016-02-20T10:05:04	sarahditum But I think what's interesting is that she knew the score pretty early on, yet she always wanted him. So to her, she has won.
HadleyFreeman	700977422913691648	2016-02-20T09:36:55	stephie08 MitchBenn AbiWilks Quite a lot, I suspect
HadleyFreeman	700977026665156608	2016-02-20T09:35:21	SueKassab Just because you wouldn't do it shouldn't stop you feeling compassion for women who do
HadleyFreeman	700976750663245824	2016-02-20T09:34:15	SueKassab Do you not think it odd that your criticism is solely directed at her
HadleyFreeman	700976271661080576	2016-02-20T09:32:21	MitchBenn stephie08 AbiWilks I think he didn't think of her at all before - it was just selfish compulsive shagging.
HadleyFreeman	700976161199890432	2016-02-20T09:31:54	MitchBenn stephie08 AbiWilks No, because he locked his phone after he realised his behaviour drove her to a breakdown
HadleyFreeman	700975994329546753	2016-02-20T09:31:15	SueKassab I think you are v unfair on her. It's not men that concern her - it's just him, and her obsession with him.
HadleyFreeman	700975638165979136	2016-02-20T09:29:50	MitchBenn AbiWilks Compulsive. I've known people like that.
HadleyFreeman	700975520004120576	2016-02-20T09:29:22	SueKassab Hardly "crowing" - it's pseudonymous and she says how angry she is. But I'm glad she feels some satisfaction, after everything
HadleyFreeman	700975114721034240	2016-02-20T09:27:45	AbiWilks They had two, and maybe that changed things a bit. But I bet not much. She always knew what he was like and always wanted him.
HadleyFreeman	700974837896978433	2016-02-20T09:26:39	saramacgregor BettySC91 She knew that all along, and she accepted it. It might not be what we want, but it is what she wanted.
HadleyFreeman	700974646741573632	2016-02-20T09:25:53	SueKassab You really think *she's* the badly behaved one here?
HadleyFreeman	700974487295172610	2016-02-20T09:25:15	AbiWilks I think it's interesting. She realised early on what the deal was, and she went through it with it. She got what she wanted.
HadleyFreeman	700974221674074112	2016-02-20T09:24:12	JonathanHaynes She was also right about divorce: she &amp; the kids wd have suffered financially. I wouldn't be like her, but I do understand
HadleyFreeman	700973291943682049	2016-02-20T09:20:30	. BettySC91 Not necessarily, though. It might not be what we want, but it's what she always wanted, and she got it.
HadleyFreeman	700972145476812800	2016-02-20T09:15:57	JonathanHaynes She does, but what's interesting about that piece is that it's not simplistic. She certainly thought her actions through.

HadleyFreeman	691677556257525760	2016-01-25T17:42:34	MoAnsar Unless you explain why these claims were untrue then, no, not newsworthy. Give the journalists something to work with, Mo!
HadleyFreeman	691675531193012224	2016-01-25T17:34:32	MoAnsar And you know, Mo, that this is not a subject for a newspaper. Why not just do what jeremyduns did and detail it in a blog?
HadleyFreeman	691674794803216384	2016-01-25T17:31:36	MoAnsar Why not just say it yourself here? That way your words won't be mediated and perhaps misinterpreted by someone else.
HadleyFreeman	691673573119954944	2016-01-25T17:26:45	MoAnsar Why not just put a stop to the lies now by saying what specifically jeremyduns has written that is untrue?
HadleyFreeman	691673064959053824	2016-01-25T17:24:44	MoAnsar The best way for journalists to be sure is for the subject to clarify what is true &amp; not, something you seem oddly reluctant to do.
HadleyFreeman	691672175766605824	2016-01-25T17:21:12	MoAnsar But it would surely be sensible for you to clarify what statements about you are inaccurate so people know and don't spread them.

HadleyFreeman	690516549833265152	2016-01-22T12:49:09	gojonstonego Male critics are allowed to critique the work of female artists. Criticism is not inherently sexist just for being negative
HadleyFreeman	690516302641893376	2016-01-22T12:48:10	gojonstonego Sure, why not? He's criticising her work, which is his job, not her appearance or body shape
HadleyFreeman	690514831091372033	2016-01-22T12:42:19	gojonstonego Or perhaps he just didn't like it? And maybe he would have - I've struggled with Hill myself
HadleyFreeman	690509382828855296	2016-01-22T12:20:40	gojonstonego But if that's how he felt about it, that's how he felt. Surely lying for the sake of tokenistic balance would be worse.
HadleyFreeman	690505868207595520	2016-01-22T12:06:42	gojonstonego I think he was pretty clear about why he struggled with it. And this is one criticism in an otherwise positive piece
HadleyFreeman	690505563130744834	2016-01-22T12:05:29	gojonstonego It's an interview, not a university thesis. Nor is it a press release and criticism is allowed.

HadleyFreeman	686658963279052800	2016-01-11T21:20:29	DanPopomatic I was talking to Oliver about a word, as you can see from the conversation. As I said, I have no problem w/ Bowie grief
