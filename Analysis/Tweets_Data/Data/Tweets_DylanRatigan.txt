DylanRatigan	707741816423116800	2016-03-10T01:36:12	Right now we tax income of all things!! Why on earth discourage working to make money?!?

DylanRatigan	707741328587825152	2016-03-10T01:34:16	Yes, That is risk. So, manage it. So tax purchases of nonessential items over 10k or 100k. It can be resolved.
