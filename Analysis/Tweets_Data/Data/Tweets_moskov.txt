moskov	685665029828423680	2016-01-09T03:30:56	Rdillman why does this look like hospital food??
moskov	685332679915507712	2016-01-08T05:30:18	"In service of what?"
moskov	684814254420176896	2016-01-06T19:10:16	Fed officials still haven't met a decline in inflation expectations they can't explain away. 
moskov	684925498984542208	2016-01-07T02:32:18	jmsfrn teespring no
moskov	684909625787863041	2016-01-07T01:29:14	jmsfrn and we are paying for Slack! Messaging and Work Tracking go well together.
moskov	684903018681118720	2016-01-07T01:02:59	Each of these companies has teams that pay for (and use) Asana. Notice how many are killing it. Coincidence?! :-) 
moskov	684552167164792832	2016-01-06T01:48:49	emiliecole I have 3 hrs of meetings tomorrow :( so embarassing
moskov	684506744400154624	2016-01-05T22:48:20	Alright, Trump isn't the GOP leader anymore!!! Now we have someone way bett ... ah fuck. 
moskov	684416899183058944	2016-01-05T16:51:19	ferenstein yes, directionally
moskov	684401691555266564	2016-01-05T15:50:53	84% down, 10% to go 
moskov	684200062767902724	2016-01-05T02:29:41	ferenstein this is pretty similar to my view: 
moskov	684142664862711808	2016-01-04T22:41:36	Economic Inequality: The Simplified Version 
moskov	684116493496262657	2016-01-04T20:57:36	ferenstein oh no!
moskov	684110368130478080	2016-01-04T20:33:16	ferenstein my only intention here is to point out what PG didn't say that people claim he did.
moskov	684110160470523904	2016-01-04T20:32:27	ferenstein my take is that the evidence suggests you shouldn't talk about inequality publicly :) (esp. if you're wealthy)
moskov	684107797575802884	2016-01-04T20:23:03	moskov but I don't know bc he didn't speak directly to points like "raising taxes is bad" and I don't want to put words in his mouth
moskov	684107559913955328	2016-01-04T20:22:07	moskov what he actually said is much more specific than what people are choosing to attack. He'd likely agree with most of the "criticisms"
moskov	684107329667600384	2016-01-04T20:21:12	It's ironic to me that PG's attempt to add nuance to "all inequality is evil" was interpreted as "all inequality is (/startups are) good"
moskov	683050255600881665	2016-01-01T22:20:46	Wow can’t believe it’s 2016, I’m still writing 2003 on all my checks because that’s the last time I used one.
moskov	682688234464219136	2015-12-31T22:22:13	moskov stewart are you using bowtie.ly or bowtieR?
moskov	682686905197051907	2015-12-31T22:16:56	pspeter3 this is a fake idea, so either or both :)
moskov	682685873159208960	2015-12-31T22:12:50	Bowties as a service
moskov	682258187337117700	2015-12-30T17:53:22	Here, I updated the chart for the NYT's big tax story with the data released today
