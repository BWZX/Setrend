davidein	618677908895240192	2015-07-08T07:08:02	Wow.  Busto meltdown. AJs with flop K10-9 with my flush draw into KK. No help.  Shortly later and short stacked A10 in JJ. Ugh. Next year.
davidein	618653830054424578	2015-07-08T05:32:21	Lost 15k to a set of fours...and an hour later won a little more with my own set of fours. Win some - lose some.  $57k
davidein	618600354138210304	2015-07-08T01:59:52	Didn't win a pot for 90 minutes. Went down to 30k.  Then hit two flops. 53k at the dinner break.
davidein	618564788877070336	2015-07-07T23:38:32	Nice level. No setbacks. Won a nice pot on last hand of level j-10 vs 10-8 on a j98xx board. 47k
davidein	618529018330021888	2015-07-07T21:16:24	First break.  33k.  A fine table.  Made a tight fold.  I will never know if that was right.  k9 on a KkJxx board. Hmmm
davidein	618495123714781184	2015-07-07T19:01:43	Time to start the main event.  I hope to give the opponents some History to Face!  Shuffling up and dealing soon.
davidein	615422412218195968	2015-06-29T07:31:51	Just when it looked fun. aQ on a q-10-5 flop. Ran into q-10.  Arghh.  Try again at the main event. A fun day.
davidein	615419390654177280	2015-06-29T07:19:51	My a9 cracked a very good player's KK and busted him.  Lucky me. 650k.  Half the field is gone.
davidein	615405310241476608	2015-06-29T06:23:54	4th break. 375k.  The highlight was all in with AK vs AK.  We spilt the pot and divided the blinds and antes!!  Cost of poker is going up.
davidein	615355086898728960	2015-06-29T03:04:20	Grounded down to 85k, doubled with AKo vs AQs, chipped up.  295k at the dinner break. Happy to be back in the game.
davidein	615306571044642816	2015-06-28T23:51:33	After a long period of card dead, I lost 1/3 of chips against a turned gutshot straight held by 5-4suited.  Well, better than last time. Ugh
davidein	615298913889681408	2015-06-28T23:21:07	First break. Nothing exciting. Started with 300k. I have about 308k.  Table seems fine. People are quiet.
