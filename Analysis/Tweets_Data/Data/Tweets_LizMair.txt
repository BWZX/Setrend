LizMair	715510225210634240	2016-03-31T12:05:05	This is dead-on: 
LizMair	715367516743327744	2016-03-31T02:38:01	This paragraph is the tell. Trump's returns examined on a regular basis by IRS just as they do for any large corp. 
LizMair	715366830689427456	2016-03-31T02:35:17	So now let's look at language of Trump letter from Morgan Lewis: . Note wording. /8
LizMair	715366102474309632	2016-03-31T02:32:24	The campaign didn't respond when I asked if this was something we should expect from them.  
LizMair	715364534660243459	2016-03-31T02:26:10	Audit in that case can be over specific aspects of a return, or whole thing. But it's an active involved process for auditee, not passive /7
LizMair	715364185090170880	2016-03-31T02:24:47	AUDIT, however, quite diff from examination. That's when IRS comes BACK at you and says "hold on buddy, we think you're lying. Prove it." /6
LizMair	715363984724066305	2016-03-31T02:23:59	What that means is IRS DOES comb over Trump's returns yearly. They also do with AT&amp;T's, or Apple's, or the Koch Bros. Completely normal. /5
LizMair	715363602023231488	2016-03-31T02:22:28	Regular examination is, for a large corporate entity like Trump's, par for course w/IRS. (obvious reasons: fraud otherwise inevitable) /4

LizMair	715362775971807232	2016-03-31T02:19:11	Trump says "I can't release my taxes! Being audited!" Well, not really true that you can't but whatever. Now he purports to offer proof. /2

LizMair	715361617018556416	2016-03-31T02:14:34	Letter Trump released to media from attys re taxes actually confirms he's LYING about being audited, but journos not attys so miss deceit.
LizMair	715361139673198593	2016-03-31T02:12:41	It says no such thing. "Examination" not an "audit," hugely diff and any tax atty could tell you as much. Amazing. 
LizMair	715307907944955904	2016-03-30T22:41:09	This is a dumb and/or dishonest thing to say. And I've seen mainstream reporters suggest it today.

LizMair	715269743473729539	2016-03-30T20:09:30	The issue is clear. Trump is unclear bc he has no idea what he's talking about and is pretending to be conservative

LizMair	714165570938257412	2016-03-27T19:01:55	One thing clear in this amazing NYT interview: Donald Trump doesn't really understand the US-Japan security pact.

LizMair	714165201843527680	2016-03-27T19:00:27	In other news, it's pretty funny that realDonaldTrump has allowed this temper tantrum about "exposing" highly public photos of his wife...

LizMair	713376524255100928	2016-03-25T14:46:31	For the record, I believe I've met Cruz once maybe twice at best. Never worked for him, but did support him in his Senate campaign.
LizMair	713374242885087241	2016-03-25T14:37:28	I bet the reason Trump campaign has been digging hard into any professional associations I've had w Cruz (none) is to smear me this way too.
LizMair	713373556373987328	2016-03-25T14:34:44	It would also be fun to get access to Trump comms staff, Trump Org emails as part of discovery in a defamation suit. amandacarpenter .
LizMair	713373392326385665	2016-03-25T14:34:05	As for people suggesting amandacarpenter slept w Cruz, she should sue them. That is obv false, as anyone who knows Amanda knows.

LizMair	713358409173569536	2016-03-25T13:34:32	Hard for me to imagine there's any real "scandal" out there about Cruz involving sex. Are Trumpkins trying to make the routine "scandalous?"
LizMair	713358210288070658	2016-03-25T13:33:45	Hang on, I've been off Twitter for most of the last 24 hours. But is the CruzSexScandal that he has had sex with his wife?

LizMair	713345759526125568	2016-03-25T12:44:17	And yes, Trumpettes on Twitter routinely threaten to send people who dislike him, esp Jews and those of us w "Jewish-sounding" names...
LizMair	713345356357103616	2016-03-25T12:42:40	Tho my kid's godparents are Jewish, so presumably, for Trump's anti-Semitic fanboys, that's enough to warrant a trip to the ovens for me.
LizMair	713344989384876032	2016-03-25T12:41:13	BTW Eric, I get anti-Semitic shit all day long from Trumpettes who hate Jews + think I am one. I'm the next best thing: Scottish-American :)
LizMair	713344603949252608	2016-03-25T12:39:41	Dude needs to check out trumptrain Twitter for a bit. They were all screaming about Trump reaching out to Jews. I just pointed it out.

LizMair	708640095784607744	2016-03-12T13:05:39	Sajizzle mattklewis I disagree with this. A few of our guys have. Most have actively rejected them.
LizMair	708639981175230464	2016-03-12T13:05:12	Sajizzle mattklewis But historically, he's been more aligned w Dems. He's a phenomenon disconnected from parties. He really is.
LizMair	708639808797745152	2016-03-12T13:04:30	Sajizzle mattklewis GOP in general hasn't. Trump and a handful of others have, and then Trump decided to run as an R.
LizMair	708639663901245441	2016-03-12T13:03:56	Sajizzle mattklewis And many of the Rs who won downticket post-2008 are the ones who supported immigration reform. See: Rubio, Marco.
LizMair	708639362494427136	2016-03-12T13:02:44	Sajizzle mattklewis relatively few Trump voters were even Republicans until relatively recently. Aggrieved Indys, Dems.

LizMair	708639043823800320	2016-03-12T13:01:28	Sajizzle mattklewis And FWIW, some white working class feeling econ anxiety, getting angry are w Bernie. V few POC in his camp, also.
LizMair	708638881583906816	2016-03-12T13:00:49	CashBama Cheri_Kentucky conncarroll HotlineJosh Reports last night were he said he canceled Chicago bc CPD advised him to.
LizMair	708638744581181440	2016-03-12T13:00:17	Sajizzle mattklewis It's not... the non-white working class portion feeling anxiety already in Obama's camp.
LizMair	708638548434489344	2016-03-12T12:59:30	Sajizzle mattklewis But sure, I think Jeff Sessions (who's endorsed Trump) hasn't been helpful on immigration. Others too, to a degree.
LizMair	708638269966262272	2016-03-12T12:58:24	Sajizzle mattklewis Also, original birthers (Phil Berg, Orly Taitz, Trump) were all Hillary people. It's an uncomfortable fact.
LizMair	708638122100264960	2016-03-12T12:57:48	Sajizzle mattklewis The RNC autopsy was post-2012 loss, and so was Gang of 8.

LizMair	708637651033853952	2016-03-12T12:55:56	Sajizzle mattklewis Trumpers are motivated by overall economic anxiety, sense white working class falling behind. Not GOP on immigration.
LizMair	708637472113221633	2016-03-12T12:55:13	Sajizzle mattklewis See RNC autopsy, Rs got Gang of 8 passed, Ryan strongly pro-immigration.
LizMair	708637309202255872	2016-03-12T12:54:35	Sajizzle mattklewis Actually, GOP at large has been positioning as very pro-immigration reform up until quite recently.

LizMair	708636900551204864	2016-03-12T12:52:57	conncarroll HotlineJosh And they might have canceled Chicago, but since it's so beneficial to Trump narrative-wise, reason to doubt that.

LizMair	708635205385502720	2016-03-12T12:46:13	mattklewis I suspect the majority of Americans, as in late 60's, look at situation and say "God, what is wrong w our country."
LizMair	708634876191367170	2016-03-12T12:44:54	mattklewis I tend to think this is true. Flipside is I do see and hear people who were open to Trump who are like "uh, all that looks bad."
LizMair	708634246378872833	2016-03-12T12:42:24	.conncarroll HotlineJosh Also pretty evident now that Trump wasn't "forced" to cancel Chicago. Beneficial to him coverage-wise that he did

LizMair	708358056032215045	2016-03-11T18:24:55	smittie61984 justkarl NathanWurtzel (We think partly because voters there are the Trump voters who sour when they hear our message)
LizMair	708357979620425729	2016-03-11T18:24:37	smittie61984 justkarl NathanWurtzel That's possibly right, tho we targeted places in IA that shoulda done the same &amp; didn't.

LizMair	708355357286993920	2016-03-11T18:14:12	justkarl NathanWurtzel This is why we are running digital ads in his district. It's one, like King's district in IA, that could go Cruz.

LizMair	700421564731408385	2016-02-18T20:48:08	NathanBedford8 There are walls in places, but it is not sealed off from Italy at all. That's my point.

LizMair	700421391699611648	2016-02-18T20:47:27	ShidelerK Actually, no, I was making the point that it's not a sealed off city-state and people can enter easily. Which is true.

LizMair	700420093038227458	2016-02-18T20:42:18	EdMorrissey Point is, Vatican City is not exactly a secured, walled off place you can't access without immigration or physical hurdles.
LizMair	700418398669271041	2016-02-18T20:35:34	LizMair I've worked there for a few weeks. A few gaps in the walls outside of St Peter's Square too.

LizMair	700138429628223488	2016-02-18T02:03:04	mstonemja And no, Cruz isn't fighting SCOTUS on gay marriage. He has a different legal interpretation to what I do, and that's fine.
