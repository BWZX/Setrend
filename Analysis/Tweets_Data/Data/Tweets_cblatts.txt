cblatts	723717647251177472	2016-04-23T03:38:27	I won't argue that Clinton is more ready to intervene than most of the democrats I know, but I roll my eyes a little at ppl who (1/2)

cblatts	723714955476910080	2016-04-23T03:27:46	Point is, despite political theater that is a primary race, I'm not sure Clinton &amp; Sanders are so diff on foreign policy. His isn't so clear
cblatts	723714473631092736	2016-04-23T03:25:51	Here seems to be a letter from a Sanders aide resigning because of Sanders' support for bombing Kosovo 
cblatts	723713554898124801	2016-04-23T03:22:12	Here for example is Bernie Sanders saying we should have intervened in Rwanda: 
cblatts	723712919821803520	2016-04-23T03:19:40	I believe Kosovo, Mali or Congo interventions could have gone badly. Libya or Iraq could have gone better. We live in a probabilistic world.
cblatts	723711957866565632	2016-04-23T03:15:51	Everyone likes good outcomes  
cblatts	723711809836998656	2016-04-23T03:15:16	Most people judge intervention by ex post outcome not ex ante quality of decision. The latter matters most in a Prez 
cblatts	723710864872869888	2016-04-23T03:11:30	In Darfur I think she advocated AU role with limited NATO support. On Iran it's the std refuse-to-rule-out line 
cblatts	723709339568091140	2016-04-23T03:05:27	Curious: How did you feel about 2011 French intervention in Côte d'Ivoire. 
cblatts	723708738012585984	2016-04-23T03:03:03	Probably true. She has always been running for President not the primary, and that means attracting Independents. 
cblatts	723707670813921284	2016-04-23T02:58:49	True, though is bias predictable? If credible threat of intervention deters then non-cases mean benefits understated

cblatts	723705325631770624	2016-04-23T02:49:30	I don't know for sure but arguably Rwanda, Darfur, Iran, Syria, Ukraine off the top of my head 
cblatts	723704285943439362	2016-04-23T02:45:22	true. Intervening is a difficult, morally hazardous decision to be made case by case with chance of error both ways 
cblatts	723703027786498048	2016-04-23T02:40:22	What Obama &amp; Clinton share is that they struggle over each intervention on a case by case basis. They also know that credible threat matters
cblatts	723701701274820608	2016-04-23T02:35:05	What I actually said is that it's complex. There are successes &amp; failures. To call oneself a hawk or dove is hubris. 
cblatts	723666466642530304	2016-04-23T00:15:05	Not easy to predict what interventions are big or small ex ante. Hindsight 20-20.  
cblatts	723654605536636931	2016-04-22T23:27:57	Maybe. Sierra Leone 2001, Liberia 2003, Côte d'Ivoire 2011. Lots of cases we forget because intervention worked.
