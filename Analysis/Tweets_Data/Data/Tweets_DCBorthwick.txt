DCBorthwick	697808662941843456	2016-02-11T15:45:24	How does China weaken its currency, without devaluing? By buying the CCY of its trade competitors... They buy JGB and CNYJPY drops lower

DCBorthwick	697781069337251840	2016-02-11T13:55:45	This is NOT a USD move... See how AUD and NZD are relatively unchanged... This is Large Purchases of JPY and EUR. Probably China. Basket
DCBorthwick	697778779863830529	2016-02-11T13:46:39	In 2010, Japan complained that the Chinese were strengthening the JPY by buying JGBs.This was discussed in the DIET. It will be noted again.
DCBorthwick	697767187763884033	2016-02-11T13:00:36	I'll say it again. I believe the run up in EUR and JPY are as a result of China now managing the Yuan against a basket of CCYs. That's it.
DCBorthwick	697482957951467520	2016-02-10T18:11:10	Re JPY intervention... The last time Japan intervened was when CNYJPY was hovering below 12.00. Today it is 17.48. I see it as unlikely.
DCBorthwick	697444845405732865	2016-02-10T15:39:43	mikeypl1971 yes, I believe it is a significant contributing factor... In 2010 this was so significant it was discussed at Japan's DIET.
DCBorthwick	697111816904798210	2016-02-09T17:36:23	Remember this:      This requires China to buy JPY and EUR
DCBorthwick	697103076856094720	2016-02-09T17:01:39	The buyer of JPY and EUR?   Would it surprise you if I said China? This is how you re-balance against a basket of CCYs. You buy the basket.

DCBorthwick	685157573469814784	2016-01-07T17:54:29	Top Issues:  1) FED raised rates on Sandy Economy. May have to reverse ala  ECB  2) USDSAR Peg... Can it hold?  China can fix its own issues
DCBorthwick	685069625516802048	2016-01-07T12:05:01	It's looking like the FED has done an ECB and raised rates too early on a foundation of sand... May need to reverse later this year. Ouch

DCBorthwick	684721022680039425	2016-01-06T12:59:47	CNY...  Let's all remember Japan had greenlight from G20 to weaken JPY to shore up domestic weakness... China taking from this playbook.
DCBorthwick	684718059844665344	2016-01-06T12:48:01	The Fed is pushing on a string if they feel it is warranted to raise rates 4 times in 2016

DCBorthwick	683787070708531201	2016-01-03T23:08:36	This'll possibly be a catastrophic escalation.. Shiite armed militias in Qatif threaten to attack Oil/Petrochemical plants in east Saudi
