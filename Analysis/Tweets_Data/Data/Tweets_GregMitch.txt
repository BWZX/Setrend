GregMitch	698697401633271808	2016-02-14T02:36:56	Rubio:  Bush kept us safe on 9/11.   Gore, it's his fault.

GregMitch	698691732435652609	2016-02-14T02:14:24	Bush:  of course president needs to make "consensus" choice--just like Republicans do.
GregMitch	698691214917251072	2016-02-14T02:12:21	Also Rubio wrong about no lame duck appointment--see 1988--but Dickerson won't fact-check.  Typical.
GregMitch	698691059946139649	2016-02-14T02:11:44	Dickerson of course blowing line of questioning--it's not a matter of "who has power" (always split between Prez and Senate).

GregMitch	698652522815344642	2016-02-13T23:38:36	Idiotic idea some are floating--get lib justice to resign so you can appoint two in balance.  Imagine GOPers going for that if in this spot.

GregMitch	698645899761754112	2016-02-13T23:12:17	So, journalists. Now that Republicans have explicitly said they will oppose any Obama nominee, you mustn’t pretend otherwise later.
GregMitch	698646458954809344	2016-02-13T23:14:30	Yes, as Ari Melber says "he brought a lot of spunk, energy"--without hastening to add, all in the wrong direction.
GregMitch	698645794669379585	2016-02-13T23:11:52	Hypocrisy alert: Repubs who would have no qualms about trying to replace a lib justice w/ a rightwinger will now fight any Obama appointee.
