muckrack	712436168902762500	2016-03-23T00:29:53	muckrack No, not a good analogy. Sports outcomes are not determined by public votes. Election outcomes are. muckedup
muckrack	712436691919765508	2016-03-23T00:31:58	Q3A to annaleighclark: What other kinds of ethical concerns should journalists covering presidential primaries consider? muckedup
muckrack	712435276895952897	2016-03-23T00:26:21	As a journalist and a citizen, I'm in favor of as many public records as possible. But we need to be alert about our own records! muckedup
muckrack	712434920820490240	2016-03-23T00:24:56	The ballot locks into your voter profile-- the same record that notes whether you voted in last election. muckedup 
muckrack	712435429904003072	2016-03-23T00:26:57	Q2B to all: Your turn! Is the sports journalist an apt analogy? Is it like simply rooting for a team while still covering? muckedup
muckrack	712433315324829696	2016-03-23T00:18:33	For regular ol' primaries in, say, 2014 or 2018, that doesn't happen. Both your candidate vote AND your party choice are secret. muckedup

muckrack	712432214911393792	2016-03-23T00:14:11	For others, that prompts them to switch btwn parties. Still others simply vote how they'd vote even if they weren't a journalist muckedup
muckrack	712432117880393728	2016-03-23T00:13:47	Party operatives, politicians, the people you cover, sources: they can access this. For some reporters, that's a deal breaker.  muckedup
muckrack	712431847192596480	2016-03-23T00:12:43	Absolutely they can. They should know, though, that it may create a public record of their party choice. muckedup

muckrack	709899134900293632	2016-03-16T00:28:37	A2 in the long run, I don't think it hurts his campaign. Trump always scores big when he insults the media. (1/2) muckedup
