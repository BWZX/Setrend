DouthatNYT	725707279903895552	2016-04-28T15:24:33	wesleyhill I think The Talisman, the book he wrote with Peter Straub, is a better/tighter venture into that terrain.
DouthatNYT	725707053931573249	2016-04-28T15:23:39	wesleyhill ... and that the DT succumbs to both fantasy-saga bloat AND to his late-career weaknesses.
DouthatNYT	725706859156525056	2016-04-28T15:22:52	wesleyhill I think King is a better realist than fantasist -- that his horror works because it's set in such a recognizable America ...
DouthatNYT	725706026117402626	2016-04-28T15:19:34	wesleyhill Mmmmmrgh.
DouthatNYT	725704823170056195	2016-04-28T15:14:47	wesleyhill Which is basically everything he wrote in the '70s.
DouthatNYT	725704497452953600	2016-04-28T15:13:29	wesleyhill Or most of the King that's worth reading, at least.
DouthatNYT	725704420076445696	2016-04-28T15:13:11	wesleyhill I read most of King while on summer vacations in Maine, which is the geographically appropriate place. Also made them scarier.
DouthatNYT	725703028788056064	2016-04-28T15:07:39	wesleyhill There's an interesting divide between people who find The Shining scarier and people who pick The Stand. I'm in group 2.

DouthatNYT	705365342084845568	2016-03-03T12:12:57	jpodhoretz Nope, maybe it has it.
DouthatNYT	705365042615734272	2016-03-03T12:11:45	It seems like Romney's speech would be exponentially better if it included a serious statement of regret over accepting Trump's endorsement.
DouthatNYT	705203657327960064	2016-03-03T01:30:28	Lotta this going around it seems: 
DouthatNYT	705201573870346242	2016-03-03T01:22:11	I don't think Trump poses any threat to libertarianism, do you?: 
DouthatNYT	705194386351476736	2016-03-03T00:53:38	Bold, innovative move by GOP campaigns this year to wait for BuzzFeed to do all of their oppo for them
DouthatNYT	705188672451252224	2016-03-03T00:30:55	DamonLinker HeerJeet It's the persistence of the Rubio-Cruz-Kasich dynamic I didn't adequately anticipate.
DouthatNYT	705188558903050240	2016-03-03T00:30:28	DamonLinker HeerJeet Trump is about 3-5 points above where I expected him to be when I was confident he wouldn't win.
DouthatNYT	705188323237740544	2016-03-03T00:29:32	DamonLinker HeerJeet I'm not impressed with Trump's consolidating powers. At all. This Michigan poll the latest example.
DouthatNYT	705187806373609472	2016-03-03T00:27:29	DamonLinker HeerJeet Most likely lose.
DouthatNYT	705187111079645185	2016-03-03T00:24:43	kausmickey Mickey, it's designed to break your heart.
DouthatNYT	705186096657911808	2016-03-03T00:20:41	HeerJeet DamonLinker If so, a case study: 
DouthatNYT	705185915367526401	2016-03-03T00:19:58	DanielLarison DamonLinker HeerJeet They'd support him, just not w/enthusiasm. See second choice s, for instance: 
DouthatNYT	705185218173472770	2016-03-03T00:17:12	DamonLinker HeerJeet But more people wantwantwant Trump.
DouthatNYT	705185131192053760	2016-03-03T00:16:51	DamonLinker HeerJeet For instance: 
DouthatNYT	705184865621245952	2016-03-03T00:15:48	DamonLinker HeerJeet It was clear in exit polls yesterday. More people satisfied w/Rubio as the nominee than Trump.
DouthatNYT	705184370525675521	2016-03-03T00:13:50	DamonLinker HeerJeet Because Trump's 30-35 percent are deeply committed.
DouthatNYT	705184184692842497	2016-03-03T00:13:05	The party would be "mad" not to consolidate around a candidate who's under 30 percent in Michigan: 
DouthatNYT	705183962226941952	2016-03-03T00:12:12	HeerJeet Basically you risk breakage no matter what you do. Not at all clear breakage less if you accept Trump.
DouthatNYT	705183832853626880	2016-03-03T00:11:42	HeerJeet It's simply saying, "putting up Rubio will break the party" ignores the fact that more Rs don't want to vote for Trump.
DouthatNYT	705183553299021824	2016-03-03T00:10:35	DanielLarison HeerJeet Gallup has Trump at +15, Rubio at +34. 
DouthatNYT	705179328703762432	2016-03-02T23:53:48	HeerJeet Rubio is more popular with Republicans than Trump.

DouthatNYT	705149900917448704	2016-03-02T21:56:52	chrislhayes charlescwcooke In my experience it's pretty Fox News specific.
DouthatNYT	705118338658095104	2016-03-02T19:51:27	jonathanchait It helps that I never really liked the Republican Party.
DouthatNYT	705118192759402496	2016-03-02T19:50:52	The last poll of Louisiana from RCP, from last September, had Carson 23 Trump 19. Can't believe Carson dropped out!
DouthatNYT	705117873312833536	2016-03-02T19:49:36	jonathanchait If Romney endorses Trump tomorrow we'll all get rather less restrained.
DouthatNYT	705117788839546880	2016-03-02T19:49:15	jonathanchait As Alex Castellanos goes, so goes Alex Castellanos.
DouthatNYT	705117576637059073	2016-03-02T19:48:25	So basically we have no polling worth anything from Louisiana, Kentucky, Maine and Kansas, right?

DouthatNYT	705064325262741504	2016-03-02T16:16:49	DamonLinker I'm just trying to be helpful :)
DouthatNYT	705063269199958016	2016-03-02T16:12:37	DamonLinker That could change. He could get up to 40-45. But he hasn't yet.
DouthatNYT	705062987061714944	2016-03-02T16:11:30	DamonLinker He clearly has a path to the nomination. But right now it involves winning winner-take-all states w/a third of the vote.
DouthatNYT	705062735437033473	2016-03-02T16:10:30	DamonLinker Demographically those are some of his best states. OK, MN, and VA better comps for a bunch of states to come.
DouthatNYT	705062429751902208	2016-03-02T16:09:17	DamonLinker He's only now facing real ad campaigns against him. Etc.
DouthatNYT	705062044446367744	2016-03-02T16:07:45	DamonLinker He's underperformed in closed primaries and caucuses -- Oklahoma, Iowa, Alaska. More of those ahead.
DouthatNYT	705061586289950721	2016-03-02T16:05:56	DamonLinker He won 35 percent in an 8-man field in NH, 33 percent in a 6-man field in SC. He's not gaining much as the field winnows.

DouthatNYT	704898390526709760	2016-03-02T05:17:27	jonathanchait Yes but it needs to find a real leader for that to happen. Otherwise it just burns and burns and burns.
DouthatNYT	704898149282930692	2016-03-02T05:16:29	HeerJeet jonathanchait My official prediction (TM) for a while has been "it won't be Trump, but it could be a contested convention."

DouthatNYT	704895575515340800	2016-03-02T05:06:16	jonathanchait If he had lost MN and VA by 10, etc., better chance of a swing to Cruz.
DouthatNYT	704895392442359808	2016-03-02T05:05:32	jonathanchait The problem for the GOP is that Rubio's night wasn't as bad as the pundits are announcing, therefore he reasonably stays in.
DouthatNYT	704893978500534272	2016-03-02T04:59:55	jonathanchait Look at the Trump belt: 
DouthatNYT	704893496927322112	2016-03-02T04:58:00	jonathanchait But the map was Trump-friendly as well. No Western states, only one upper Midwest.
DouthatNYT	704893324310749185	2016-03-02T04:57:19	chrislhayes JeffreyGoldberg No it's actually terrible I shouldn't joke.
DouthatNYT	704893028939513860	2016-03-02T04:56:09	jonathanchait Except that on the evidence of tonight, Trump's support isn't surging into the 40s.
DouthatNYT	704891965972860930	2016-03-02T04:51:55	I hope someone is staying up with Chris Christie tonight.

DouthatNYT	704888099852038144	2016-03-02T04:36:33	michaelbd DanFosterType baseballcrank Which is why he merits lukewarmness. But it isn't absent, unlike w/Cruz.

DouthatNYT	704854180326813696	2016-03-02T02:21:46	But, oh, right, RUBIO HASN'T WON A STATE.
DouthatNYT	704854106083426304	2016-03-02T02:21:29	Relative to their ideal paths from a month ago, Cruz has actually underperformed more than Rubio. Rubio's about 5 points off, Cruz about 10.
DouthatNYT	704853285744672768	2016-03-02T02:18:13	Cruz couldn't consolidate the South. How does he win in Ohio, or Michigan, or Florida, or Illinois?

DouthatNYT	704853032308051968	2016-03-02T02:17:13	Cruz is winning states. Rubio is not (at all!). Cruz has beaten Trump. Rubio has not. Cruz will have more delegates. Obvious case for Cruz.
DouthatNYT	704852757442789376	2016-03-02T02:16:07	Both Cruz and Rubio have totally reasonable cases for why they should be the anti-Trump. Not strained cases; totally reasonable cases.

DouthatNYT	703411777745375234	2016-02-27T02:50:11	HeerJeet jeffspross Yes, mixture is fair. Do you think if Wallace had won Dem nomination in 1968 and RFK had lived he'd have endorsed?
DouthatNYT	703411579128320000	2016-02-27T02:49:23	allahpundit If Trump wins and Rubio barely loses he'll primary him in 2020.
DouthatNYT	703411298751660032	2016-02-27T02:48:17	allahpundit Look, if Trump wins the presidency *and* is a huge world-historical success then of course resistance is futile.

DouthatNYT	703410516752998400	2016-02-27T02:45:10	jeffspross HeerJeet Of course they will imitate. But if analogue is Wallace not Goldwater, RN imitated w/o ever associating.
DouthatNYT	703410006310391808	2016-02-27T02:43:08	allahpundit No, after. I'm saying they won't endorse.
DouthatNYT	703409195417280512	2016-02-27T02:39:55	22. I could go on, which is a sign that this should be a blog post or a column. But enough; more anon; good night.
DouthatNYT	703408785059139584	2016-02-27T02:38:17	21. And the calculus for the men who opposed them would have been very different than the calculus was for Nixon in '64.
DouthatNYT	703408674220470273	2016-02-27T02:37:51	20. If one of those guys had succeeded in taking over a party, it would have been very different than what happened in '64 and '72.
DouthatNYT	703408552774397952	2016-02-27T02:37:22	19. Trump is not George Wallace, but he has a lot of Wallace in him. And Huey Long, Perot, etc.
DouthatNYT	703408059104796672	2016-02-27T02:35:24	18. And for Cruz and Rubio, more than other GOPers, will embody resistance. They have more to gain from continuing to embody than giving up.
DouthatNYT	703407807266217985	2016-02-27T02:34:24	17. Whereas there *will* be an infrastructure of groups that opposed Trump - socons, hawks, libertarians - that will reward resistance.
DouthatNYT	703407097367678976	2016-02-27T02:31:35	16. So yes, future candidates will imitate Trump. But there won't be a Trumpian *infrastructure* that they will seek to pick up.
DouthatNYT	703406731104292864	2016-02-27T02:30:08	15. And despite their resemblances, Trump is not a Marine Le Pen or Alex Salmond. He's not sticking around to build a movement over years.
DouthatNYT	703406322075705344	2016-02-27T02:28:30	14. A huge share of Trump's support in conservative media is opportunistic, ratings-seeking. Not at all true of Goldwater.
DouthatNYT	703406118832308224	2016-02-27T02:27:42	13. If you believe that Breitbart and Ann Coulter are the equivalent of NR and Buckley, then you may disagree. But I think they are not.
DouthatNYT	703405928163483648	2016-02-27T02:26:56	12. And w/o Trump to hold it together, it's likely to go back to being an inchoate tendency awaiting activation, not an institutional force.
DouthatNYT	703405219762348032	2016-02-27T02:24:07	11. But the essential element is personal, not ideological. Trumpism isn't *just* a cult of personality. But it is a cult.
DouthatNYT	703404669285093376	2016-02-27T02:21:56	10. Trump is different. There is an inchoate Trumpism, absolutely -- populist/nationalist/protectionist, etc.
DouthatNYT	703404205931896833	2016-02-27T02:20:05	9. In both cases, it was clear that what had lifted them would outlast them, not just as a tendency, but on an institutional level.
DouthatNYT	703404041628487681	2016-02-27T02:19:26	8. This is why the Goldwater-McGovern comparisons are so often made, and wisely. McGovern was likewise a party man lifted by a movement.
DouthatNYT	703403727558942721	2016-02-27T02:18:11	7. And the movement that lifted him in 1964 was not focused around him personally; it was a pre-existing grassroots + intellectual cause.
DouthatNYT	703403446670647299	2016-02-27T02:17:04	6. He was an ideologue, yes, but also an institutionalist, a party man, with plenty of pre-existing allies in the party structure.
DouthatNYT	703402890157813760	2016-02-27T02:14:52	5. But that's only the start. Because Trump is not at all analogous to Goldwater. AuH20 was a widely respected figure in the party.
DouthatNYT	703402512821448705	2016-02-27T02:13:22	4. So endorsing came much easier. There wasn't a "Team Nixon" of anti-Goldwater bitter enders to take it as a deep betrayal of their cause.
DouthatNYT	703401952080732160	2016-02-27T02:11:08	3. So he hadn't been out publicly making "Goldwater will destroy the party" case, or otherwise casting himself as leader of anti-AuH20 camp.
DouthatNYT	703401526522470400	2016-02-27T02:09:27	2. First, Nixon in 1964 was a party elder: Ex-VP, ex-POTUS candidate. He was not a rival of Goldwater for the nomination, except sub rosa.
DouthatNYT	703401135554564096	2016-02-27T02:07:53	1. Okay, let me explain why HeerJeet is wrong that Marco Rubio should/will endorse Trump for the same reasons Nixon endorsed Goldwater.
DouthatNYT	703388738827776000	2016-02-27T01:18:38	HeerJeet Putting kids to bed now, so explain away and I'll be back.
DouthatNYT	703388290402131969	2016-02-27T01:16:51	HeerJeet baseballcrank Not in the same way, no. Trump is not Goldwater.
DouthatNYT	703388179286589440	2016-02-27T01:16:24	jbarro Cruz loves a losing cause.
DouthatNYT	703388114673397761	2016-02-27T01:16:09	HeerJeet If I am wrong, it will be discovered. Except that it won't be bc Trump won't be the nominee :)
DouthatNYT	703387992757542912	2016-02-27T01:15:40	If Rubio has a nat'l future after losing to Trump, he will have to have that constituency touting him + supporting him. So no endorsement.
DouthatNYT	703387184032837632	2016-02-27T01:12:27	And Rubio? Rubio's core support, the ppl who like him the most, are a cohort of religious conservatives who almost universally *hate* Trump.
DouthatNYT	703386658109071366	2016-02-27T01:10:22	Other elected Rs? I have no idea. But Cruz would be leader of congressional resistance to President Trump; nothing for him in endorsement.
DouthatNYT	703386328738697216	2016-02-27T01:09:03	Of course I've predicted Trump won't be the nominee, so this is a prediction about a scenario that would prove I can't predict anything.
DouthatNYT	703386058860453888	2016-02-27T01:07:59	Time for a prediction: If Trump is the nominee, neither Rubio nor Cruz will endorse him.
DouthatNYT	703364730505842689	2016-02-26T23:43:14	jbarro For some, yes, but I think there's more ship-burning going on than that.

DouthatNYT	697927605631262721	2016-02-11T23:38:02	yeselson But he needs to gain it by knifing his actual rivals, if he can, not a lame duck POTUS.

DouthatNYT	697927345219485697	2016-02-11T23:37:00	yeselson Well he needed/needs to show toughness, and they thought showing it against Obama was the way to go.
DouthatNYT	697927244392566785	2016-02-11T23:36:36	yeselson I also *suspect* that the tax plan could be revised if he gets the nomination, since it's been revised once already.

DouthatNYT	697926844243386369	2016-02-11T23:35:01	yeselson Also I think they think that Trump has seized all the populist territory for now.
DouthatNYT	697926320479666176	2016-02-11T23:32:56	yeselson I think the theory of sudden Obama bashing was, "time to present as unifying figure for the party, party agrees Obama bad, GO."
DouthatNYT	697926128053391360	2016-02-11T23:32:10	yeselson That, I think, is psychologically correct.

DouthatNYT	697925760078766084	2016-02-11T23:30:42	yeselson Yes but given where Clinton and Sanders are on tax policy plenty of room for GOP to offer more to its donors than Dems ...
DouthatNYT	697925466561323008	2016-02-11T23:29:32	yeselson And picking that fight (on the CTC) cost him almost nothing, so far as I can tell.

DouthatNYT	697925158871425024	2016-02-11T23:28:19	yeselson True -- but the pressure on him should be much weaker than the pressure on Rubio or Jeb.

DouthatNYT	697137355375906816	2016-02-09T19:17:52	mckaycoppins You don't think the fact that the Nephites *loved* background sources is pretty suggestive?
DouthatNYT	697132153830776833	2016-02-09T18:57:12	freddiedeboer and so 2) nominating AuH2O helped catalyze a kind of massive resistance w/o which the tide would have run higher.
DouthatNYT	697131902738812929	2016-02-09T18:56:12	freddiedeboer Anyway, I think the best case for the Goldwater moment was that 1) a liberal high tide was coming anyway ...
DouthatNYT	697131630415233024	2016-02-09T18:55:07	freddiedeboer But couldn't I write a version of that piece every time a red-state governor sucks it up and expands Medicaid?

DouthatNYT	697129278102700033	2016-02-09T18:45:46	freddiedeboer The labor left, yes. Not the welfare-state left, though.
DouthatNYT	697129073085181954	2016-02-09T18:44:57	freddiedeboer Like you say, I'm not a typical conservative. But Pat Buchanan would pretty stridently disagree :)
DouthatNYT	697128948375908352	2016-02-09T18:44:27	freddiedeboer And yes, it may well be that the liberal high tide would have come in any timeline.
DouthatNYT	697128815462588416	2016-02-09T18:43:56	freddiedeboer I don't know who the right nominee would have been for that. But clearly not AuH20.
DouthatNYT	697128560532832256	2016-02-09T18:42:55	freddiedeboer Basically I think conservatives in 1964 should have campaigned the way Nixon did in 1968.
DouthatNYT	697128209633165312	2016-02-09T18:41:31	freddiedeboer All of it came into being in the liberal high tide that followed '64. How much of it has been dismantled?
DouthatNYT	697127960650870784	2016-02-09T18:40:32	freddiedeboer But race/ethnicity is a good example. Think of the edifice of immigration policy, affirmative action/disparate impact, etc.
DouthatNYT	697127569871732736	2016-02-09T18:38:59	freddiedeboer Sure, southern resisters got nothing from Goldwater's nomination. And I'm glad of it.
DouthatNYT	697127300404551680	2016-02-09T18:37:55	freddiedeboer Much of what actual modern conservatism opposes was enacted by liberal politicians, bureaucrats and judges btw 1965-1980.
DouthatNYT	697126844534022144	2016-02-09T18:36:06	freddiedeboer In electoral politics, yes. In terms of their policy objectives? Not hardly.
DouthatNYT	697126252344385537	2016-02-09T18:33:45	freddiedeboer True, but your "typical conservative" is in the sway of a happy myth, not in possession of a blueprint for left-wing success.
DouthatNYT	697125915717976065	2016-02-09T18:32:24	freddiedeboer LBJ's landslide didn't lead to the Reagan revolution. Liberal misgovernment + stagflation led to the Reagan revolution.

DouthatNYT	697124937144922112	2016-02-09T18:28:31	freddiedeboer Which deal?
DouthatNYT	697124664527740928	2016-02-09T18:27:26	freddiedeboer Except that because of '64, liberalism won massive policy victories that no subsequent "Goldwater Republican" would undo.

DouthatNYT	694220361131507715	2016-02-01T18:06:46	15/ And an Iowa prediction? Ummm ... let's say Trump 30, Cruz 28, Rubio 19. BC I think other candidates will underperform their polls.
DouthatNYT	694219777468928000	2016-02-01T18:04:27	14/ As for who *will* win: I'd give Rubio, Cruz and convention madness (Mitt!) equal odds right now. So no confident predictions there.
DouthatNYT	694219514645450752	2016-02-01T18:03:24	13/ So on this last day, I'm sticking with my not-Trump prediction, God help me. And I won't revise till after South Carolina.
DouthatNYT	694219131336429573	2016-02-01T18:01:53	12/ For my part, though, I still look at Trump's best-case scenario as pushing it all the way to the convention, not winning.
DouthatNYT	694218833146597376	2016-02-01T18:00:42	11/ And you have to underrate Cruz, which a lot of people are doing right now bc of his lost Iowa lead. (And underrate Rubio, too.)
DouthatNYT	694218441960656896	2016-02-01T17:59:09	10/ That, and the persistent fracturing of the not-Trump, not-Cruz vote. You need it to stay fractured not only past NH, but past SC etc.
DouthatNYT	694218275400609792	2016-02-01T17:58:29	9/ So to believe Trump will be the nominee, you have to believe strongly in the power of momentum to carry him all the way.
DouthatNYT	694217493603295236	2016-02-01T17:55:23	8/ In NH, his numbers are a little better. But the last sprint to voting hasn't happened, + he'd still lose to a unified establishment vote.
DouthatNYT	694216724460216320	2016-02-01T17:52:19	7/ In a three-way race w/Cruz and Rubio, he'd probably lose narrowly. He's got 35 percent of the electorate in his corner, but that's it.
DouthatNYT	694216476065173504	2016-02-01T17:51:20	6/ So far up, in fact, that he's one of the least popular candidates in the field. If he was in a two-man race w/Cruz, he'd lose easily.
DouthatNYT	694216351595040772	2016-02-01T17:50:50	5/ As voting has neared, voters have focused in, and his rivals have started actually attacking him, his unfavorables have gone up.
DouthatNYT	694216017216716801	2016-02-01T17:49:31	4/ The current polling in Iowa basically bears out my reasoning. Trump's support is deep, intense -- and narrow:

DouthatNYT	692464431054323715	2016-01-27T21:49:20	Highlights from my interview with DouthatNYT, including JRR Tolkien conservatism v. Ayn Rand conservatism: 
DouthatNYT	692422402396024832	2016-01-27T19:02:19	In certain ways, Iowa has always been a better state for Rubio's profile than NH. Which is probably a big part of his problem.
DouthatNYT	692420630289989632	2016-01-27T18:55:17	michaelbd The attitude is extended, I think, because Cruz and Trump are SUCH departures from the normal pattern of nominees.
DouthatNYT	692415898808946688	2016-01-27T18:36:29	GabrielRossman mattfrost ANATHEMA!
DouthatNYT	692381504350089216	2016-01-27T16:19:49	If you read my Sunday column (or if you didn't), read this LPDonovan piece making the same argument weeks earlier: 
DouthatNYT	692168970464530432	2016-01-27T02:15:17	He's so bad, but he does it so well:

DouthatNYT	692039068746645504	2016-01-26T17:39:06	michaelbd Say Cruz ekes out a win in Iowa. That costs Trump 5 percent. Kasich surges. Dead heat! KASICHMENTUM!
DouthatNYT	692038857198571520	2016-01-26T17:38:15	michaelbd Or, for that matter, WHY NOT FIRST?
DouthatNYT	692038502427549696	2016-01-26T17:36:51	michaelbd Why wouldn't Kasich finish second?
DouthatNYT	692036349709402112	2016-01-26T17:28:17	DanielLarison Kasich is clearly benefiting from the Christie-Rubio-Jeb circular firing squad.
DouthatNYT	692036268616720384	2016-01-26T17:27:58	DanielLarison Negative ads work! Maybe someday someone will try them against Trump.

DouthatNYT	691800386785677315	2016-01-26T01:50:39	jneeley78 michaelbd allahpundit JayCostTWS But I don't think he has a path to that one on one.
DouthatNYT	691800311552438272	2016-01-26T01:50:21	jneeley78 michaelbd allahpundit JayCostTWS I actually think, crazy person that I am, that Jeb could beat Trump one on one.
DouthatNYT	691800209089765380	2016-01-26T01:49:57	dandrezner You'll leave me in the dark, then.
DouthatNYT	691799125948502025	2016-01-26T01:45:39	HeerJeet chrislhayes What he's facing now is why everyone assumed he couldn't pull it off. So if he wins anyway, maybe he can.
DouthatNYT	691798400023543812	2016-01-26T01:42:46	At this point if Ted Cruz loses Iowa it will be a case study for a book called The Party Decides Against.

DouthatNYT	691797073478418433	2016-01-26T01:37:29	michaelbd JayCostTWS allahpundit But Jeb ain't happening.
DouthatNYT	691796963734503425	2016-01-26T01:37:03	michaelbd JayCostTWS allahpundit I'm sorry too.
DouthatNYT	691792567109849092	2016-01-26T01:19:35	JayCostTWS allahpundit Yup. If they wanted Rubio they'd be swinging to him now. They still want Jeb.
DouthatNYT	691728063424544770	2016-01-25T21:03:16	HeerJeet Deca .....
DouthatNYT	691723113554378752	2016-01-25T20:43:36	KevinWGlass Yes but as Sandersmania shows a lot of people are pretty unhappy with just "tinkering at the edges" from the left.
DouthatNYT	691714010664833024	2016-01-25T20:07:26	MichaelRStrain But what counts as "over time"?
DouthatNYT	691713864312983552	2016-01-25T20:06:51	Lot of good points here but NOBODY HAS VOTED YET: 
DouthatNYT	691711606842114048	2016-01-25T19:57:53	"The worst-case scenario for a Trump presidency is that he will do the things those horrified ex-presidents did." 
DouthatNYT	691711680682835973	2016-01-25T19:58:10	(ff Douthat@NYT before he goes full Buchananite.)
DouthatNYT	691711516635176963	2016-01-25T19:57:31	The Autor research on trade basically vindicates Pat Buchanan's read on what's happened between his run and Trump's: 
DouthatNYT	691708938857762816	2016-01-25T19:47:17	New study on trade goes well with my post from yesterday

DouthatNYT	691705912336236544	2016-01-25T19:35:15	jbarro Nate_Cohn jonathanchait MichaelRStrain So I'm probably just overcompensating by persuading myself it won't happen.

DouthatNYT	691705625626173440	2016-01-25T19:34:07	jbarro Nate_Cohn jonathanchait MichaelRStrain Look, the thing is I'm going to enjoy the hell out of things if Trump wins the nomination.
DouthatNYT	691703968146264066	2016-01-25T19:27:31	Nate_Cohn jonathanchait MichaelRStrain But that doesn't seem to be happening. Still time, of course. But not that much.
DouthatNYT	691703824847900672	2016-01-25T19:26:57	Nate_Cohn jonathanchait MichaelRStrain Christie beating Rubio handily struck me as the best scenario for Trump.
DouthatNYT	691703669029507072	2016-01-25T19:26:20	Nate_Cohn jonathanchait MichaelRStrain If Christie were surging in NH, I would say yes. But he doesn't seem to be.
DouthatNYT	691703211883892739	2016-01-25T19:24:31	jonathanchait MichaelRStrain Nate_Cohn Right, but I won't have new info that's relevant to my thesis until the field narrows.
DouthatNYT	691702952428453888	2016-01-25T19:23:29	chrislhayes And I do not believe that will happen. Me, and the Japanese soldier sharing my bunker.
DouthatNYT	691702777026846720	2016-01-25T19:22:47	chrislhayes But there isn't a national primary. He has to sustain his lead in a 2-3 candidate race, across months, facing heavy fire.
DouthatNYT	691702619417505792	2016-01-25T19:22:10	chrislhayes No, they aren't wrong. If there were a national primary held today Trump would win a plurality.
DouthatNYT	691701648809410561	2016-01-25T19:18:18	MichaelRStrain jonathanchait Nate_Cohn So I guess it's just me.

DouthatNYT	691700484122476544	2016-01-25T19:13:41	jonathanchait Nate_Cohn Yes.
DouthatNYT	691689087955255296	2016-01-25T18:28:24	matthewschmitz Is the Andrews piece ... waspish?
DouthatNYT	691627873518641152	2016-01-25T14:25:09	Also bet President Trump would be involved with fewer prostitutes + mobsters than one of these "great presidents": 
DouthatNYT	691627273062060032	2016-01-25T14:22:46	Doubt President Trump would bring us as close to nuclear armageddon as one of the "great presidents" on this cover:

DouthatNYT	691322652938625024	2016-01-24T18:12:19	allahpundit Clearly you need to acquaint yourself with the Old Testament.
DouthatNYT	691297382470926336	2016-01-24T16:31:54	jpodhoretz michaelbd But yeah, Christie as the nominee and then the divine wind to put him over the top at the end.
DouthatNYT	691297303320215552	2016-01-24T16:31:35	jpodhoretz michaelbd Always get in.   ALWAYS.   Unless you're Jeb in 2016.
DouthatNYT	691297193039413248	2016-01-24T16:31:09	michaelbd He could still win NH as a write-in candidate.
DouthatNYT	691296508231180288	2016-01-24T16:28:25	michaelbd Yeah, Romney could have won hawks by saying "I was right about Putin etc." while also saying "I was right about immigration."
DouthatNYT	691295112685604865	2016-01-24T16:22:53	michaelbd McCormackJohn JohnEkdahl He, more than Jeb, has a lose the primary to win the general problem.
DouthatNYT	691292930909290496	2016-01-24T16:14:12	jpodhoretz Sure. But nobody's stopping Jeb's donors (or anyone's donors) from jumping ship to Rubio.
DouthatNYT	691292669218275328	2016-01-24T16:13:10	michaelbd allahpundit If he sat just five points higher in Iowa and NH, though ...
DouthatNYT	691292562888486912	2016-01-24T16:12:45	michaelbd allahpundit Nope. Rubio's campaign is predicated on a theory that ... has yet to be vindicated.
DouthatNYT	691292298135650304	2016-01-24T16:11:42	allahpundit michaelbd Yeah, no blame to Jeb for attacking Rubio. It's all in the game. Blame to him for running in the 1st place.

DouthatNYT	691007211494117378	2016-01-23T21:18:52	Surely the lesson of Trump is that if Bloomberg seriously thinks he could be president, he should run no matter who gets nominated.
DouthatNYT	691001494657638401	2016-01-23T20:56:09	To shoot someone on 5th Avenue is deplorable, but to be rude to a fellow member of the US Senate is unpardonable

DouthatNYT	690246396432134144	2016-01-21T18:55:39	continetti JayCostTWS But are they right? Are they total fools? Hard to say.
DouthatNYT	690246265972604929	2016-01-21T18:55:08	continetti JayCostTWS It's a signal, obviously, that they don't take any of his populism seriously.

DouthatNYT	689871302316986368	2016-01-20T18:05:10	ThePlumLineGS Depends on if Trump's brand survives back-to-back losses, and how close Rubio is to the top 2 in each case.
