anthonyweiner	721807807067119616	2016-04-17T21:09:26	ChrisSturr I feel ya.  You may not have your top choice in November but you will have a good one.  Good talk.
anthonyweiner	721806844386242560	2016-04-17T21:05:36	ChrisSturr I appreciate your view.  But when you say hijacked you really mean that they won and Gary Hart, Jessie, HRC lost.
anthonyweiner	721806155845124096	2016-04-17T21:02:52	ChrisSturr could not disagree more.  See my DN oped.  The hodge podge of ways we choose has meant better nominees.  WHICH. IS. THE. GOAL.
anthonyweiner	721805672250241029	2016-04-17T21:00:57	ChrisSturr we totally are.  But up til now you have been taking about non dems.

anthonyweiner	721800555136462848	2016-04-17T20:40:37	thomasjivy CecilyKeating the very idea of nominations is to limit choice.  You won't have huckabee on your ballot. Is that an affront too?

anthonyweiner	717421128554254337	2016-04-05T18:38:20	DominicPanakal you say that based on the polls.  That is my point.  Campaigns know stuff public polling misses.

anthonyweiner	695075021023240193	2016-02-04T02:42:53	actually Rant in General was the name of ska band i was in high school.  Back then sears didn't suck this bad. 
anthonyweiner	695072241197912064	2016-02-04T02:31:50	dude, we gotta form a support group. 
anthonyweiner	695071703391719424	2016-02-04T02:29:42	yes mike.  i went that route.  do you know their service "window" is 8-5 and not showing up is a thing at sears? 
anthonyweiner	695070405866999808	2016-02-04T02:24:33	id like to sign off and make dinner, but did i mention that sears is horrible at selling major appliances and delivering them?
anthonyweiner	695068702203629573	2016-02-04T02:17:47	from downtown...nothing but net! 
anthonyweiner	695068286413856770	2016-02-04T02:16:07	I didn't try the store.  I already have a rotary dial phone and a typewriter.   
anthonyweiner	695067565710839808	2016-02-04T02:13:16	So my sears tweetstorm has earned me 14 unfollowers and 26 followers.  I expect a teletype from sears soon.
anthonyweiner	695066605785595904	2016-02-04T02:09:27	Actually they learned about it via a memo in the pneumatic tube. (someone please make me a Hudsucker Proxy vine) 
anthonyweiner	695061297658994688	2016-02-04T01:48:21	GreenFenceTime no he isnt for that reason.  the other 742 reasons are valid tho.
anthonyweiner	695060854304280576	2016-02-04T01:46:35	Thanks Junior.  I appreciate the follow.  btw, can you call sears for me.   
anthonyweiner	695059858660409349	2016-02-04T01:42:38	Just not in the selling things to people and then delivering them business. 
anthonyweiner	695058100961873921	2016-02-04T01:35:39	is CmonSearsMakeWeinerStopTweetingAboutSears already a hashtag?
anthonyweiner	695056792779411456	2016-02-04T01:30:27	Thanks, but how interesting would it really be to hear me rant about how bad sears is at selling things to people? 
anthonyweiner	695055289494720512	2016-02-04T01:24:29	I'd love this.  Sadly, I have no time.  I need to reserve most of my day for sears to not show up with stuff. 
anthonyweiner	695053886839721984	2016-02-04T01:18:54	For those of you tuning in for the latest about @ sears, they said  it would take hours to find the record of my order.  Damn carbon paper.
anthonyweiner	695053078849048576	2016-02-04T01:15:42	The sears service bot asked me if I might have called using a different name.  If only I knew a different name was an option for me.
anthonyweiner	695052246535528454	2016-02-04T01:12:23	So the best thing about the sears help hotline is the part about "stay on the line if you have a rotary phone" 
anthonyweiner	695034480122318849	2016-02-04T00:01:47	Wow, this dude bought stuff and someone delivered it.  Has sears seen this? 
anthonyweiner	695032115918934016	2016-02-03T23:52:24	I'm sure you are a very nice bot.  Nothing personal.  
anthonyweiner	695031479861133313	2016-02-03T23:49:52	Store pick up.  That's charming.  I'm sure they will crush Amazon with that specialty.  Sending stuff notsomuch.  
anthonyweiner	695026435153661952	2016-02-03T23:29:49	exactly!  btw, did i mention that sears is bad at being a store to buy things at?
