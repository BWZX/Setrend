EconomPic	719905376024408064	2016-04-12T15:09:51	millennial_inv okay read it... think my original argument makes sense. As active gets smaller, less talented go away, and talent goes to HF
EconomPic	719890699466838016	2016-04-12T14:11:32	millennial_inv I guess it's what drives the lower AUM... lack of demand or limited supply
EconomPic	719890322805788672	2016-04-12T14:10:02	millennial_inv but the thought exercise was to limit supply of active
EconomPic	719890178366541824	2016-04-12T14:09:28	millennial_inv talent today goes to:  A) larger fund managers that can charge less due to scale B) hedge funds  Eliminate A = more B
EconomPic	719889820726591489	2016-04-12T14:08:02	millennial_inv thus talent is scarcer and goes to highest paying opportunities (hedge funds) while balance is passive to balance cost

EconomPic	710211507095638018	2016-03-16T21:09:53	3rdMoment that makes sense
EconomPic	710210124141363200	2016-03-16T21:04:23	3rdMoment that would inverse natural demand for companies cheap to those expensive
EconomPic	710209755659145216	2016-03-16T21:02:55	3rdMoment well... there have been huge net outflows of active to passive in the last decade. think of those implications...
EconomPic	710208831792349184	2016-03-16T20:59:15	3rdMoment if it's $30, passive still buys an equal number of shares while active could hold off unless down to $10
EconomPic	710208269344616449	2016-03-16T20:57:01	3rdMoment if they accurately (questionable) saw it was overvalued, they would sell it
EconomPic	710207088870498304	2016-03-16T20:52:19	3rdMoment not sure what that means, but i think true passive investing does not aid market inefficiency if that's what you mean
EconomPic	710205005161242626	2016-03-16T20:44:02	3rdMoment non-passive not forced to buy whole market. doesn't change shares outstanding, just pricing of shares outstanding
EconomPic	710204773014831104	2016-03-16T20:43:07	3rdMoment disagree... $100 coming in could simply buy company's A through C only, making company D drop to where investor would transact
EconomPic	710203719560912896	2016-03-16T20:38:56	3rdMoment demand for their stock went from 25 shares to 17. supply=demand at the equiilibrium. This shifts the equilibrium lower over time
EconomPic	710203500907651073	2016-03-16T20:38:04	3rdMoment take a look at my example... fairly priced co's (company's A-C) got less $$ invested because company D was rich
EconomPic	710203288583593984	2016-03-16T20:37:13	3rdMoment $$ goes into all companies whether rich or cheap at the same weight, but if rich with more money at expense of fairly priced co's
EconomPic	710203066256068608	2016-03-16T20:36:20	3rdMoment in the case of non-corporate securities (i.e. commodities) it directly impacts the businesses of all companies with exposure
EconomPic	710202766938005504	2016-03-16T20:35:09	3rdMoment and it not only impacts companies that are rich / cheap, but companies that get less or more capital due to that mispricing
EconomPic	710202574633197568	2016-03-16T20:34:23	3rdMoment yes... the impact is when companies issue (secondary or as currency for acquisitions) or redeem shares (buybacks)
EconomPic	710200253358718977	2016-03-16T20:25:09	3rdMoment but... most big companies mean revert, meaning they were too big
EconomPic	710200166389825537	2016-03-16T20:24:49	3rdMoment so... i would tend to agree it does not have to do with big companies receiving too much, as long as they are fairly valued
EconomPic	710199989390188544	2016-03-16T20:24:07	3rdMoment so if something is rich, they are receiving too much capital at the expense of companies priced fairly / cheap
EconomPic	710199813451751424	2016-03-16T20:23:25	3rdMoment thought more about this (see example)... mispricings make you allocate less / more to all companies

EconomPic	700543861907542016	2016-02-19T04:54:06	lhamtil agree, but different argument IMO
EconomPic	700542956411817985	2016-02-19T04:50:30	lhamtil trust me... I agree govts are awful spenders
EconomPic	700542795778383876	2016-02-19T04:49:52	lhamtil agree, but the case for it is that's it's not budgeted (and should have been years ago)
EconomPic	700542577989160961	2016-02-19T04:49:00	lhamtil if $1mm was instead used to build a space ship with $100mm economic value, but Walmart closed and lost $1B value, -$900mm relative
EconomPic	700542308198952960	2016-02-19T04:47:56	lhamtil so the $1mm investment "added" $1b of economic activity. The same $1mm would need to find another project of similar value to be =
EconomPic	700542056653918212	2016-02-19T04:46:56	lhamtil what level of economic activity would there be the following day (roughly)?
EconomPic	700541909186408450	2016-02-19T04:46:21	lhamtil assume they had produced $1B activity the day before. Now let's assume for $1 million, they could save every store and website.
EconomPic	700541454511288320	2016-02-19T04:44:32	lhamtil and their website crashed too
EconomPic	700541274755981312	2016-02-19T04:43:49	lhamtil just try to answer my question... literally every store collapsed. How much business?
EconomPic	700540943959662596	2016-02-19T04:42:31	lhamtil if every Walmart store was so old they'd all collapse to the ground tomorrow, how much business would they have the following day?

EconomPic	700540515171696641	2016-02-19T04:40:48	lhamtil yeah... if a needed repair, I disagree with your conclusion. The issue would be if there was no need, but there is massive need

EconomPic	700538901627146241	2016-02-19T04:34:24	lhamtil but without, transport ion becomes less facilitating. Not to mention call for massive upgrades to public transport

EconomPic	685281770867011585	2016-01-08T02:08:00	syouth1 ST is very different investor base than LT (ST investors can't hold LT). BBB's (I believe) do return more than HY historically
EconomPic	685265543662665729	2016-01-08T01:03:31	syouth1 yes, but also implies case for allocating from bonds to high vol asset class even if low or negative returns (i.e. commodities)
EconomPic	685264140907065344	2016-01-08T00:57:57	syouth1 high beta / low beta stocks or bonds vs managed futures may be better examples
