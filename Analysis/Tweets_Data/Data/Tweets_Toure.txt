Toure	725460015495139329	2016-04-27T23:02:00	Let‚Äôs not call what Trump did today a major policy speech. It was nothing of the sort. It wanted to be that but it did not become that.

Toure	725409964295094272	2016-04-27T19:43:07	I wonder who in the Cruz campaign said ‚ÄúI know what we can do to turn things around and stop Trump! Name Carly as VP!"
Toure	725409596802764800	2016-04-27T19:41:39	No, it was not. Not at all. 
Toure	725407087489077249	2016-04-27T19:31:41	If you read and think about the speech it becomes really, really hard not to ridicule it.  
Toure	725407242577649665	2016-04-27T19:32:18	If Cruz is doing fantasy VP picks why stop at Carly? Why not pick Jesus??? Cruz/Christ 2016 can‚Äôt be stopped!!!

Toure	725372336317288448	2016-04-27T17:13:36	Trump speech is pathetic in terms of understanding the role America plays in the world, how to win War on Terror, and threats we face.
Toure	725372633919971328	2016-04-27T17:14:47	No because there‚Äôs no new Jay-Z album out. Catch up.  
Toure	725371588737007616	2016-04-27T17:10:38	Indeed, Trump seems thinks to NOT having a policy (or at least articulating one) *IS ITSELF A KIND OF POLICY.*
Toure	725371507669655552	2016-04-27T17:10:18	This election is going to be a wonk's nightmare. How do you debunk bad ideas when one side doesn't even have ideas, just attitude?
Toure	725371712825638913	2016-04-27T17:11:07	Trump is really taking this GOP anti-intellectual thing seriously.

Toure	725365637980278784	2016-04-27T16:46:59	To say this Trump foreign policy speech is light on specifics is an insult to specifics.
Toure	725364960021364738	2016-04-27T16:44:17	Trump says America's friends need to know we'll stand by our commitments, but wants to change terms of those commitments so they pay more
Toure	725365373864800257	2016-04-27T16:45:56	Why would they? One of our major parties is running an ignorant, orange demagogue for president.   
Toure	725365853231915008	2016-04-27T16:47:50	If the goal was to make Trump sound credible on foreign policy then yes, by the Bush-in-Iraq standard, ‚ÄúMission Accomplished!"
