laura_nelson	692812518587105280	2016-01-28T20:52:30	eliglazier True!
laura_nelson	692812105154572288	2016-01-28T20:50:52	The way to do that, of course, would be to cut expenses and/or make more money, by reducing fare evasion, raising fares, or both.
laura_nelson	692811668582064128	2016-01-28T20:49:08	Washington didn't say how much he aims to increase that ratio. It's currently ~26%, meaning ~74% of metrolosangeles is taxpayer subsidized.

laura_nelson	692809768092565504	2016-01-28T20:41:35	Staying on time and on budget on major projects (Regional Connector, Crenshaw Line, Purple Line) is "a major challenge," Washington says.

laura_nelson	692446333253201920	2016-01-27T20:37:25	EthanElkind Thanks for sharing. Fair enough to quibble with 1985 figure. But the last few years are concerning, as is the 2006-2015 slump.

laura_nelson	692440817936388096	2016-01-27T20:15:30	tweetsupa Thanks for sharing!
laura_nelson	692440010058895361	2016-01-27T20:12:17	Or, more accurately, ridership isn't mentioned on the meeting agenda. A board member/staffer could, of course, spontaneously bring it up.
laura_nelson	692439521758093312	2016-01-27T20:10:21	For those wondering, the metrolosangeles board received a report on ridership last week, but won't be discussing it at their board meeting.
laura_nelson	692436420938571776	2016-01-27T19:58:02	bikecar101 jayhesker schadenfraade LowHeadways That depends on your policy goals. So for that, you'll have to ask the policy makers.
laura_nelson	692436062711500800	2016-01-27T19:56:36	schadenfraade LowHeadways Right. Broader point is obviously that while clean/on-time buses &gt; dirty/late buses, many wish they could drive.
laura_nelson	692435799061721091	2016-01-27T19:55:33	bikecar101 jayhesker schadenfraade LowHeadways Definitely, with the proper policy choices.
laura_nelson	692434773394984960	2016-01-27T19:51:29	jayhesker schadenfraade LowHeadways Which is fine! My point is that discretionary riders, like you, are a small piece of total ridership.
laura_nelson	692434552946462721	2016-01-27T19:50:36	jayhesker PedalingCuong Some trains can be full, or all trains can even be mostly full, and ridership can still be down.
laura_nelson	692434375825297408	2016-01-27T19:49:54	jayhesker ericgarcetti We didn't cherry-pick. Transit ridership is down, year-over-year, and in the long term. Price of gas is one factor.
laura_nelson	692431684348858369	2016-01-27T19:39:12	TaupeAvenger sandypsj JakeAnbinder Yes.
laura_nelson	692431608062832641	2016-01-27T19:38:54	TaupeAvenger Yeah, I'm interested in the effect of Uber and Lyft as well. But that would be a draw for the wealthier, discretionary riders.
laura_nelson	692431105580990464	2016-01-27T19:36:54	JakeAnbinder Gracias! And yes. We tried to make that point, but you make it much more succinctly :)
laura_nelson	692430966602756098	2016-01-27T19:36:21	sandypsj JakeAnbinder And depends on definition of "redundant." In some cases, rail opened, and "parallel" bus lines a mile away were cut.
laura_nelson	692430658786979840	2016-01-27T19:35:08	sandypsj JakeAnbinder I thought the same thing. It is such a rabbit hole.
laura_nelson	692428863620698113	2016-01-27T19:28:00	schadenfraade LowHeadways People who can afford a car in L.A. but choose transit are the exception, not the rule. (See: median income.)
laura_nelson	692428534581690369	2016-01-27T19:26:42	schadenfraade lowheadways Most riders I interview are proud to take transit, and don't mind it so much. But would prefer to drive.

laura_nelson	692426903106510849	2016-01-27T19:20:13	CalUrbanist I've been slowly picking away at a Bay Area transit story. I'm fascinated by the differences between north and south CA.
laura_nelson	692426253383647233	2016-01-27T19:17:38	Marccaz But writing critical stories about transit doesn't preclude writing critical stories about driving. They're not mutually exclusive.
laura_nelson	692426046415708160	2016-01-27T19:16:48	Marccaz In terms of the framing: It's important to hold public agencies accountable by evaluating performance. Ridership is one metric.
laura_nelson	692424996434657281	2016-01-27T19:12:38	CalUrbanist Fair. We allude to it‚Äî"the worst recession since WWII, which prompted deep service cuts"‚Äîbut could have been more explicit.
laura_nelson	692424463753814021	2016-01-27T19:10:31	awalkerinLA My hope is that this will prompt some soul-searching about the most efficient ways to serve the largest number of riders.
laura_nelson	692421322517913600	2016-01-27T18:58:02	Marccaz Thank you!
laura_nelson	692400814065897473	2016-01-27T17:36:32	I still don't feel safe on metrolosangeles. Until that changes &amp; service is better, people won't ride laura_nelson

laura_nelson	692393438646370304	2016-01-27T17:07:14	Good story! No. 1 Metro issue for me is riding after 8pm, which is dangerous + unpredictable.  
laura_nelson	692398202692182017	2016-01-27T17:26:10	Juan_Matute boyonabike62 I wrote about this last year:  Many factors have some effect, magnified when combined
laura_nelson	692395921762574340	2016-01-27T17:17:06	boyonabike62 Yes to all of those things. The gas question differs depending on which agency you talk to. OCTA says yes - Metro, not so much
laura_nelson	692395355984543744	2016-01-27T17:14:51	TaupeAvenger Curious what you thought of the story, since I know we've talked about this before!
laura_nelson	692395103298531328	2016-01-27T17:13:51	nealunger A reward for reading all the way through :)
laura_nelson	692394369828007936	2016-01-27T17:10:56	AlexWithAK StreetsblogLA OCTA data on that in the story. Metro hasn't collected similar info, but my hunch is yes, you're right.
laura_nelson	692391887576121346	2016-01-27T17:01:04	AlexWithAK StreetsblogLA Kind of, but there appear to be broader economic forces at work. More on gas prices here: 
laura_nelson	692390684297449472	2016-01-27T16:56:17	cmonstah chrisrusak Yes. And Metro is considering even more cuts after 8 pm.
laura_nelson	692390153801875456	2016-01-27T16:54:11	cmonstah chrisrusak Crazy to say, since story was so long, but we didn't have space to address late-night issues. May get its own story.

laura_nelson	692389107155079168	2016-01-27T16:50:01	AlexWithAK StreetsblogLA Can't speak for all agencies, but Metro doesn't see a correlation with gas prices‚Äîmost riders don't have cars.
laura_nelson	692388368727023616	2016-01-27T16:47:05	drschweitzer Maddz4planning StevenMWhite Will also add that it's impossible to address every facet in the detail we'd like in &gt;2000 words

laura_nelson	692386491700359168	2016-01-27T16:39:38	PedalingCuong Could be! I've always thought no transit agency is an island (see also: similar/worse declines in OC, Santa Monica, etc.)
laura_nelson	692382202924027904	2016-01-27T16:22:35	njudah suldrew don't most major transit agencies get funding from homeland security? I think metro does
laura_nelson	692381948849868800	2016-01-27T16:21:35	tomsteidl thanks! Nice of you to say
laura_nelson	692380275490234368	2016-01-27T16:14:56	tomsteidl Story has more on that. Only other thing: transit ridership, even in growth years, is not keeping pace with population growth
laura_nelson	692379543353573377	2016-01-27T16:12:01	tomsteidl Fair point, but most experts say 1996-2006 surge was connected to consent decree/no fare increases/better bus service, not rail
laura_nelson	692378866250182656	2016-01-27T16:09:20	suldrew at some point I'm gonna finish my SF transit story
laura_nelson	692377764742082560	2016-01-27T16:04:57	suldrew Also true! Sounds crazy since story is so long, but only had space to scratch the surface in safety. That'll get a separate story
laura_nelson	692377349099233283	2016-01-27T16:03:18	suldrew That's true. But even in most better years, not keeping pace with population growth.
laura_nelson	692376996463013888	2016-01-27T16:01:54	nycsouthpaw hm dunno, but would guess that during the heyday, trips on streetcars made up a greater % of total trips than bus/rail do now
laura_nelson	692376208420519937	2016-01-27T15:58:46	UnsuckUSC It is discouraging, but we hope it prompts soul-searching about how better to serve existing riders, and how to attract new ones
