Joshmedia	701578795023618048	2016-02-22T01:26:34	KristyT not 100% happy with my answer. some startups spend way too much time engineering best culture vs best product
Joshmedia	701578143576948737	2016-02-22T01:23:58	KristyT 1/2 Before, startup culture was out of balance: too many death marches. Now swung too far the other way: too much entitlement
