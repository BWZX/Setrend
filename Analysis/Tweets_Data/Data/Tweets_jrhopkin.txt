jrhopkin	712939165533474816	2016-03-24T09:48:37	edrennie77 you’re claiming we need to leave the EU to ‘secure' our borders. I disagree.
jrhopkin	712938605220601856	2016-03-24T09:46:23	edrennie77 and by the way, Norway is in Schengen, and outside the EU. It is not the same thing.
jrhopkin	712938481866113024	2016-03-24T09:45:54	edrennie77 we had border controls *inside the UK* until the Good Friday agreement. You don’t have a point that I’m interested in getting.
jrhopkin	712938166102179840	2016-03-24T09:44:39	MxSba OK for deflation read unhealthily low nominal wage growth.
jrhopkin	712937875365576704	2016-03-24T09:43:29	edrennie77 we did not sign the Schengen agreement. And EU freedom of movement doesn’t stop you arresting criminals at the border.
jrhopkin	712937226016014336	2016-03-24T09:40:55	MxSba agreed. But they have been pressing the South to deflate. With no offsetting inflation, aggregate deflation is inevitable.
jrhopkin	712936940388106240	2016-03-24T09:39:46	edrennie77 wildman_adam indeed, we have border controls in France. Try catching a ferry.
jrhopkin	712936820422651904	2016-03-24T09:39:18	edrennie77 wildman_adam Schengen is nothing to do with freedom of movement. We have border controls.
jrhopkin	712936404586782720	2016-03-24T09:37:39	MxSba I suppose they do, but there is no policy to achieve it. Where’s the pressure for wage rises in Germany?
jrhopkin	712936039258722304	2016-03-24T09:36:12	KidiabaPonyTail I guess so. Can’t see what it stops us doing though. We still had internment in 70s Northern Ireland.
jrhopkin	712935713277353984	2016-03-24T09:34:54	MxSba the recommended internal devaluation in the South, without reflation in the North, leads to nominal wage falls, surely?
jrhopkin	712934785207902208	2016-03-24T09:31:13	Given that it’s what they claim they want, it’s probably helping them sleep soundly.
