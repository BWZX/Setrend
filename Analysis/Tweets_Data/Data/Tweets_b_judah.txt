b_judah	725962425044971520	2016-04-29T08:18:24	SimonMagus My point is awful to speak to a victim of racist, sexist or homophobic assault that way as "ignorant" of the hate they received.
b_judah	725961588944019456	2016-04-29T08:15:05	SimonMagus I appreciate you may have tweeted in haste. Happens. In this case maybe remove billeting tweet and I would consider your offer.
b_judah	725960942807207936	2016-04-29T08:12:31	SimonMagus You just called me - a Jew who suffered a serious antisemitic assault - ignorant and unjustified on the city's racism problem.
b_judah	725960294061633536	2016-04-29T08:09:56	SimonMagus I appreciate your offer not your insult of "my ignorance" after a racist attack. Suggest you delete your tweet and start again.
b_judah	725959420585250816	2016-04-29T08:06:28	SimonMagus Insulting someone  who suffered a racist attack with zero police follow up "ignorant" as of realities antisemitism is shocking.
b_judah	725956766450638849	2016-04-29T07:55:55	SimonMagus I find your tone belittling and insulting to someone who suffered a racist assault - I suggest you rephrase your tweet. CST_UK

b_judah	725836730159484928	2016-04-28T23:58:56	This is true - too much casual racism in politics full stop. 
b_judah	725834251510419456	2016-04-28T23:49:05	Fact that accusations of antisemitism have been used to discredit Left &amp; critics of Israeli policies does NOT give antisemites a free pass

b_judah	725656921555001344	2016-04-28T12:04:26	Ken Livingstone achieved many good things for London and beyond. But all political lives end in failure, &amp; he should now depart voluntarily
b_judah	725656426824228864	2016-04-28T12:02:28	By calling Hitler a Zionist Livingstone is rhetorically smearing everyone who believes the Jewish homeland has a right to exist as Nazis.
b_judah	725653626748833797	2016-04-28T11:51:21	A period of silence from Ken Livingstone is overdue, especially on antisemitism racism &amp; Zionism.  It’s time he left politics altogether
b_judah	725643106549415936	2016-04-28T11:09:33	This. 
b_judah	725642574204145664	2016-04-28T11:07:26	Let's be clear. Ken is not saying "Hitler was supportive of Jewish people's right to self-determination". He is saying "Zionism = Nazism".
b_judah	725642111819890689	2016-04-28T11:05:35	This is like nothing else. 
b_judah	725444113382912000	2016-04-27T21:58:49	This piece by emranmian is the one to read on the Naz Shah affair. Brave one to write too, impressed. 
b_judah	725440030861332481	2016-04-27T21:42:36	This really bothered me. So; nice to know it did not actually take place.
b_judah	725439823213899776	2016-04-27T21:41:46	Buzzfeed has retracted, corrected its claim that Labour HQ edited out the word antisemitism from Naz Shah's apology.

b_judah	725438765876006912	2016-04-27T21:37:34	One of the points I raised at a great HubIntegration event. English lessons cost money and tough on low pay. 
b_judah	725437115551637504	2016-04-27T21:31:00	You are staring at the definition of the word crass. 
b_judah	725357177649635330	2016-04-27T16:13:22	Hmm. 
b_judah	725345531233468416	2016-04-27T15:27:05	Labour HQ on Buzzfeed article: "This claim is completely inaccurate." Says apology "was not seen, written, edited or approved by Labour HQ".
b_judah	725339433826930688	2016-04-27T15:02:51	Just trying to think if there's anyone in Corbyn's inner circle with much experience of commissioning &amp; editing stuff...
b_judah	725339310648602625	2016-04-27T15:02:22	J_Bloodworth Did she actually say that?
b_judah	725339016980271104	2016-04-27T15:01:12	This revelation - editing out word "antisemitism" from Shah's apology - has seriously shaken my faith in Labour HQ. 
b_judah	725337884891471872	2016-04-27T14:56:42	Surely, something significant has to happen now. Please. 
b_judah	725335027878379523	2016-04-27T14:45:21	Great jimwaterson scoop. Labour HQ excised references to anti-semitism from Naz Shah's apology. Astonishing.

b_judah	725301963102015488	2016-04-27T12:33:58	JamesW_754 It shouldn't be this way. But it is...
b_judah	725301049620312064	2016-04-27T12:30:20	Despite providing photos of attackers - Galloway supporters - police did nothing. Shah made no comment on the attack before the election.
b_judah	725300861774221312	2016-04-27T12:29:35	I didn't realize quite how unsafe it was to be a Jew in Bradford until I was attacked for being one. 
b_judah	725300417157062657	2016-04-27T12:27:49	Naz Shah was pretty keen to talk to me until she found out tabletmag was a Jewish publication. 
b_judah	725299998355783680	2016-04-27T12:26:09	Here's why Palestine is local politics and Shah is pretty normal for a Bradford politician.  
b_judah	725299571535007744	2016-04-27T12:24:27	Here is my report - from before Galloway ousted - on how Palestine became Bradford local politics for tabletmag. 
b_judah	725299190050508800	2016-04-27T12:22:56	As regards Naz Shah's anti-semitism - I thought I'd repost my reporting from Bradford from last year - a city where it is unsafe to be Jew.
b_judah	725296617050542080	2016-04-27T12:12:43	I have never read anything so patently absurd. Would be funny if it wasn't so insulting to the Jewish community.

b_judah	724330716490784774	2016-04-24T20:14:34	b_judah I think my ancestral hatred was of the Russian Empire.

b_judah	724328670781935617	2016-04-24T20:06:27	But then again, maybe I am merely suffering from ancestral hatred of the British empire.
b_judah	724327118864277504	2016-04-24T20:00:17	Final thought - that "half Kenyan comment" - cuts a lot of voters, journalists who are themselves - half something. 
b_judah	724326170146312199	2016-04-24T19:56:30	Does anyone remember just a month or two ago, when Boris Johnson was agonising - AGONISING - over whether to campaign for Brexit or Remain?
b_judah	724326299540553728	2016-04-24T19:57:01	As referendum enters final stretch nothing but Farage-like slur on Obama answering why Putin only pro-Brexit leader.

b_judah	724324701523337222	2016-04-24T19:50:40	I think voters may be worried by the failure of Brexiteers to check that the Anglosphere thingy was actually a goer. 
b_judah	724324648352096257	2016-04-24T19:50:28	Instead Obama debacle reveals Brexit based around a fantastical view of Anglosphere and strategy-less, emotional, nationalistic solipsism.
b_judah	724324029885243393	2016-04-24T19:48:00	Anglosphere project building up over 20 years could have been moderately effective in Washington, Canberra, Ottawa.

b_judah	724323395379302400	2016-04-24T19:45:29	Brexit could've built thinktank, lobbying network and block in congress. Instead imagined US as fantasy big England. 
b_judah	724322767986892801	2016-04-24T19:42:59	Brexiteers totally failed to persuade Washington, Canberra and Ottawa of their cause. And they didn't even try.

b_judah	716915200750915584	2016-04-04T09:07:58	Any serious political-economy analysis of say Russia's wealth would have to be these figures plus estimated offshore wealth of the rich.
b_judah	716914969925783552	2016-04-04T09:07:03	We need to stop naively trusting in our analysis numbers in GDP, budget and other economic figures that exclude offshore wealth of the rich.
b_judah	716914589242408960	2016-04-04T09:05:32	The PanamaLeaks show no analysis of contemporary political-economy can exclude the estimated $1trillion offshore.

b_judah	716234885481017344	2016-04-02T12:04:38	Referendum badly hurting UK's reputation, influence in Eastern Europe. Seen as erratic un-committed to Western bloc. 
b_judah	716233967255560193	2016-04-02T12:00:59	They fear Brexit triggering a sequence of referendums - and every time the Kremlin Embassies growing in influence. 
b_judah	716233607057170432	2016-04-02T11:59:33	They believe Brexit would seriously damage the EU opening the door to Vladimir Putin to play divide and rule. 
b_judah	716233222938632193	2016-04-02T11:58:01	Estonian officials are worried about Brexit - which they view as a very real possibility.

b_judah	716023157577150465	2016-04-01T22:03:18	owenhatherley MarchGlas Super interesting.
b_judah	716023060768419840	2016-04-01T22:02:55	owenhatherley MarchGlas The cheap labour aspect is fascinating. I always thought it was just like Israel's "boat people" policy.
b_judah	716022826839498752	2016-04-01T22:01:59	owenhatherley offpiste9 MarchGlas You see my point on polling though.
b_judah	716022639798710273	2016-04-01T22:01:15	owenhatherley MarchGlas I thought it was just like Begin in Israel accepting a token population, for ideological reasons.
b_judah	716022507791388677	2016-04-01T22:00:43	owenhatherley MarchGlas I knew they were there: what I didn't know is there was a cheap labour linkage, as you implied.
b_judah	716022358134358017	2016-04-01T22:00:07	owenhatherley offpiste9 MarchGlas I think polling misses the intensity, zealotry of which somehow holds a belief, and emotions behind it.

b_judah	716021592187396097	2016-04-01T21:57:05	owenhatherley offpiste9 MarchGlas Istanbul's Greek population (spared Lausanne) lost it's property in '70s. And elites now live there.

b_judah	716021306974683136	2016-04-01T21:55:57	owenhatherley MarchGlas Well, I think that's rhetorical. One aspect is post-war capital needed and wanted cheap labour and sucked it in...
b_judah	716021073003823104	2016-04-01T21:55:01	owenhatherley offpiste9 MarchGlas Greece of course it's much further back and it's not occupied by Turkey until 1991.
b_judah	716020821102358529	2016-04-01T21:54:01	owenhatherley offpiste9 MarchGlas That's an interesting point.
b_judah	716020661643251712	2016-04-01T21:53:23	owenhatherley offpiste9 MarchGlas Well Poland 1945 - 1990s saw on a communal level an end to chronic ethnic violence.
b_judah	716020131571359744	2016-04-01T21:51:17	owenhatherley offpiste9 MarchGlas Yes! So that's a difference, and loops back to the fear of losing majority status, back to '89.
b_judah	716019719476740099	2016-04-01T21:49:38	owenhatherley offpiste9 MarchGlas Explain?
b_judah	716019667689668609	2016-04-01T21:49:26	owenhatherley offpiste9 MarchGlas Yes, I agree.
b_judah	716019374335909888	2016-04-01T21:48:16	owenhatherley offpiste9 MarchGlas Plus I think there's collective memory of bloodcurdling end of multiethnicty vs. peaceful monoethnicty.
b_judah	716019027500466177	2016-04-01T21:46:53	owenhatherley offpiste9 MarchGlas Well, clearly 1991 political cultures are in part consciously rebirths of 1939 political cultures.

b_judah	716018285821739008	2016-04-01T21:43:56	owenhatherley offpiste9 MarchGlas Memory that Vilnius was not majority Lithuanian city in particular I think at play here.
b_judah	716017970196180992	2016-04-01T21:42:41	owenhatherley Of course!
b_judah	716017712372269057	2016-04-01T21:41:40	owenhatherley offpiste9 MarchGlas Dogwhistled and collective unspoken memory of very different pre-1945 demography plays a huge part.
b_judah	716017484701298688	2016-04-01T21:40:45	owenhatherley I think, there's something of a realization of well, that power dynamic, in the garbled discussion I am overhearing that.
b_judah	716017192714809344	2016-04-01T21:39:36	offpiste9 owenhatherley MarchGlas Which, by discovering EU is not the project they thought it was, the Baltics feel intensely.
b_judah	716017006378631168	2016-04-01T21:38:51	owenhatherley MarchGlas Argues all discussions of demographic threats have an inherent ideology: and even implicit spectre of genocide.
b_judah	716016587438952449	2016-04-01T21:37:12	owenhatherley Have you read this? 
b_judah	716016285881135105	2016-04-01T21:36:00	owenhatherley MarchGlas Scotland has utterly different demograophy. And I see Flemings are politically very hostile to immigration.
b_judah	716015889783586817	2016-04-01T21:34:25	owenhatherley MarchGlas And you have the same poor demographics. And in Hungary the Roma demographic boom due to fertility rates.
b_judah	716015748968280069	2016-04-01T21:33:52	owenhatherley MarchGlas Obviously, each case different! But the political class/population saw EU as a nation-state building project.
b_judah	716015472194535424	2016-04-01T21:32:46	Now here, an alternative take on what I was tweeting. 
b_judah	716015221760991233	2016-04-01T21:31:46	So, my conclusion: it's worth understanding the context as to why Eastern European EU states are hostile to refugee resettlement.
b_judah	716014960606887936	2016-04-01T21:30:44	Here are the UN statistics on projected populaiton declines by 2050. These are well known, politically used figures. 
b_judah	716013950001876992	2016-04-01T21:26:43	owenhatherley I'm just thinking aloud. Just gonna finish the thread and then come right back to this point...
b_judah	716013662205579268	2016-04-01T21:25:34	So, shock about discovering nature of EU is fusing together with memory of demographic colonization and projections of declining population.
b_judah	716013213284966400	2016-04-01T21:23:47	Vehemence in the Baltics and Central Europe against refugee resettlement comes from discovering this was not, for Germany, an EU principle.
b_judah	716012887878344704	2016-04-01T21:22:30	Where in the Baltic and Central Europe the EU in the 1990s was viewed as a tool for building post-colonial, but classical nation states.
b_judah	716012675466137600	2016-04-01T21:21:39	It's a fascinating perceptions issue: EU was viewed in 1990s in Western Europe as a tool for building multi-ethnic post-ethnic stateghood.
b_judah	716012388248588289	2016-04-01T21:20:30	The spectre that Germany might conceivably one day impose resettlements, chaning demography, on the Baltic is interpreted hysterically.
b_judah	716012058333028352	2016-04-01T21:19:12	Estonia and other Baltic states viewed the EU/NATO as a tool to reclaimed their lost nation states annexed by Stalin. Now, in the EU...
b_judah	716011875507507201	2016-04-01T21:18:28	In 1989 ethnic Russian made up over 30% of the Estonian population, and this percentage was higher in the cities and neighboring Latvia.
b_judah	716011069815332865	2016-04-01T21:15:16	Existing, in the Baltic states, previously as part of the multi-ethnic USSR where immigration was used to subjegate etnnic Estonians.
b_judah	716010849563983872	2016-04-01T21:14:24	The answer is post-colonial trauma: these are former Russian imperial provinces that reclaimed themselves as nation states in 1991.
b_judah	716010647721549824	2016-04-01T21:13:35	But why is there such passion/paranoia about demography, majorities, and percentages of the majority population in Eastern EU member states?
b_judah	716010314135969793	2016-04-01T21:12:16	So spectre of mass migration and refugee resettlement chills the population. Even a small-ish number could transform Estonia's demography...
b_judah	716009914628444160	2016-04-01T21:10:41	And with atrociously bad fertility rates and emigration the population is projected to decline 14% by 2050, akin to all other Baltic states.
b_judah	716009542803460096	2016-04-01T21:09:12	So why? Estonia, of 1.3m people, only has an ethnic Estonian population of 69% and but an ethnic Russian population of 25%.
b_judah	716009120785166336	2016-04-01T21:07:31	But why is a country which has only accepted 7 refugees in state of hysteria about mass migration and not-on-the-cards refugee resettlement?
b_judah	716008811463634944	2016-04-01T21:06:18	I'm in Estonia, and fascinating, to see how the refugee crisis and spectre of mass migration is shaking politics.

b_judah	715457546593693697	2016-03-31T08:35:46	Very rarely does a former European affairs minister of an EU state leave office and then travel reporting across the world for his new book.
b_judah	715457224034881536	2016-03-31T08:34:29	Anyone remotely interested in foreign affairs should follow former minister MacaesBruno on his extraordinary land journey across Eurasia.

b_judah	706139029172035584	2016-03-05T15:27:18	DougShaw Anyone one country - like Poland, or Romania - can veto an EU agreement with the UK. So if we try and put visas - they stop deal.
b_judah	706137828435087360	2016-03-05T15:22:32	DougShaw But I do see there is a migration control case for Brexit. Personally feel it's outweighed by the trade case many times over.
b_judah	706137555280990208	2016-03-05T15:21:27	DougShaw The only way to control European migration is to leave common market which would be catastorphic for British trade.
b_judah	706136384952733696	2016-03-05T15:16:48	DougShaw The only credible case for Brexit is migration. But that's the case that's being made by Leave as requires leaving common market.

b_judah	704439533736173568	2016-02-29T22:54:07	MaxWindCowie Thank you!
b_judah	704319808691707904	2016-02-29T14:58:22	It's very simple: if you want to control immigration you need to get out of the European Union and out of the single market.
b_judah	704318256354619393	2016-02-29T14:52:12	Farcical to claim that Britain could be in the single market but control immigration. Labour is a commodity. Obviously.
b_judah	704329282101837824	2016-02-29T15:36:01	Trump's foreign policy is simple. America is biggest loser from its alliances and can only become a winner again by pacts with its enemies.
b_judah	704329273222569988	2016-02-29T15:35:59	Trump may not keep his promises: but as he builds a Trump Party his ideas are in a sticky phase. Trumpism is forming as anti-Reaganism.
b_judah	704328033143033856	2016-02-29T15:31:03	Trump's foreign policy: he's the anti-Bush but also the anti-Reagan. Trump is an imperial downsizer. 
b_judah	704327159935016960	2016-02-29T15:27:35	Trumponomics is protectionist anti-globalisation. The opposite to free-trade Reaganomics delighted to outsource industry to China, Mexico.
b_judah	704326518873464832	2016-02-29T15:25:02	It's astonishing how far the TrumpCrisis has shown Republican voters hunger for leftist policies: no more outsourcing and trade tariffs.
b_judah	704326093180895234	2016-02-29T15:23:21	The TrumpCrisis should provoke a deep soul-searching debate on the American right on consequences of outsourcing and erosion middle class.
b_judah	704325203275485185	2016-02-29T15:19:48	Donald Trump polling an astonishing 49% nationwide for the Republican nomination. ThisIsReallyHappening 
b_judah	704324780267278337	2016-02-29T15:18:07	Trump is on verge of consolidating a permanent Trump Party at least and nomination at most. So what his world view? 
b_judah	704324512062578688	2016-02-29T15:17:04	This Is Really Happening. 
b_judah	703915512925962242	2016-02-28T12:11:51	Putin is keen on Brexit. That's something for Eurosceptics to think about

b_judah	704267992469737472	2016-02-29T11:32:28	The Trump Party - we are on verge of the Donald coalescing a serious faction and thus permanent fixture in politics.

b_judah	704264478502813696	2016-02-29T11:18:30	Trump is anti-free trade - and rapidly turning the Republican base his way. This should be worrying the Brexiteers.

b_judah	703216139493642240	2016-02-26T13:52:47	So, just say we demanded reimposing visas on Romania, Poland, Baltics - these states could veto our access to the single market.
b_judah	703215870709993472	2016-02-26T13:51:43	Curious thing about the Brexit debate is that it doesn't cover how any EU-27 country could veto Boris's new deal with Britain. Like Poland.
b_judah	703210217002106880	2016-02-26T13:29:15	guy_levin The only case for Brexit I see is on migration, but that isn't being made as that obviously ends our single market access.

b_judah	703001608217628672	2016-02-25T23:40:19	This essay on Trump by Matt Tabibi is really very good. 
b_judah	703000472685322240	2016-02-25T23:35:48	Narcomania Of course. I just feel America, Canda, are strongly "post-Anglosaxon."

b_judah	702996016715403266	2016-02-25T23:18:06	But Brexit is all about the imgaination - the dream, longing, for the auld Anglo-Saxon seafaring world - lamented so quietly, deeply.

b_judah	702995182850023429	2016-02-25T23:14:47	Another curious thing about Brexiteers is they are ignoring that Trump is turning the Republicans pro-tarriffs and against free trade.
b_judah	702992825265352704	2016-02-25T23:05:25	Just as Trump shows how sharply different America is, and how wrong visions of  single Transatlantic Anglo-Saxon conservative movement are.
