lauraolin	720416199482281984	2016-04-14T00:59:41	LockerianTimes They‚Äôre supporting multiple people who have endorsed Bernie.
lauraolin	720415236449308672	2016-04-14T00:55:51	roqchams I‚Äôm not sure why that means I get called as a racist user of POC as props, but okay
lauraolin	720414998519001088	2016-04-14T00:54:54	roqchams I‚Äôm guessing I won‚Äôt convince you here, which is fine, but wanted to explain my POV
lauraolin	720414713616678912	2016-04-14T00:53:47	roqchams and they‚Äôre doing more to support women in tough races than Bernie. 34 v 3
lauraolin	720414631248936961	2016-04-14T00:53:27	roqchams No idea. but the fact remains that they still support many candidates who support Bernie
lauraolin	720414326197084161	2016-04-14T00:52:14	roqchams How I am using them? Genuinely confused
lauraolin	720414256877998080	2016-04-14T00:51:58	roqchams Okay, but claiming it was because of her Bernie endorsement was BS
lauraolin	720414001675563009	2016-04-14T00:50:57	roqchams Not attacking me. They‚Äôre attacking Emily‚Äôs List, which was their intention.
lauraolin	720413571566284804	2016-04-14T00:49:14	roqchams The subject line is literally "This will probably make you angry." angry at whom, if not EL?
lauraolin	720413433074548736	2016-04-14T00:48:41	roqchams If it's not an attack, just big coincidence that my replies have been filled with Bernie supporters today screaming EL is corrupt
lauraolin	720412972384817156	2016-04-14T00:46:51	roqchams EL is supporting several other women who endorsed Bernie. So I'm not sure how you can argue they pulled b/c of her Bernie support
lauraolin	720412768851988480	2016-04-14T00:46:03	erintothemax They're all "the establishment."
lauraolin	720412667618263042	2016-04-14T00:45:39	Is there a women's organization the Sanders campaign is cultivating good relationships with? Real question. 
lauraolin	720412517105700865	2016-04-14T00:45:03	roqchams I'm glad they're supporting Flores. They can do that without shitting on an org supporting women in key races, including many WOC

lauraolin	720410306371977216	2016-04-14T00:36:16	Including at least seven women of color, but did you know that Emily's List is racist, establishment, and anti-progressive?
lauraolin	720410108941901824	2016-04-14T00:35:29	The Bernie camp just sent out an email supporting 3 women candidates, so I guess that makes up for them attacking an org that supports 34
