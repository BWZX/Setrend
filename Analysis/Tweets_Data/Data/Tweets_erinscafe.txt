erinscafe	708807392067067904	2016-03-13T00:10:25	Yes, okay. 7 on 7. The Buccaneers have the ball. They're outrunning the Jags, and there's the first touchdown.
erinscafe	708806516116029440	2016-03-13T00:06:57	I think this is 7 on 7 flag football. But the Buccaneers have 8 and the Jaguars have 9 on the field.   I'm sure this will be sorted soon.

erinscafe	692758114089639936	2016-01-28T17:16:19	joelhamill so...it's a block by block law. But really, GROWN-ASS PEOPLE DON'T RIDE THEIR BIKES ON THE SIDEWALK.
erinscafe	692757588887244800	2016-01-28T17:14:14	joelhamill kinda. It doesn't define business district well. Essentially a block with apartments, a church or store is a business district.

erinscafe	692400620473556992	2016-01-27T17:35:46	Like, say, social security contributions. They pay local and federal taxes that go to subsidies, grants, et cetera, items UM's can't get.
erinscafe	692400437333512193	2016-01-27T17:35:03	What amuses me about anti-immigration people is they miss that undocumented migrants pay taxes but won't ever see the money back.

erinscafe	691427890479509504	2016-01-25T01:10:29	Mel Gibson lives in a trailer and is having beer for breakfast and Danny Glover lives in a house and is having eggs.  I knew it.
