MichalakisCon	716921966217662464	2016-04-04T09:34:51	And some ahem cough techs are masters at this
MichalakisCon	716921761569214465	2016-04-04T09:34:02	7, finally the big sin other than dictators hiding assets offshore is aggressive profit shifts and cash tax trapped money
MichalakisCon	716921230255738880	2016-04-04T09:31:55	@KeshikCapital ultimately all tax will he payed by the fund / investors back home as the money comes back home and it marked to mkt
MichalakisCon	716920349632258052	2016-04-04T09:28:25	6. Also these days not only manager research but also tax and operational due diligence would rule out dodgy ones
MichalakisCon	716920085659529216	2016-04-04T09:27:22	5. Can't comment on Panama but as LadyFOHF says - comes across the desk it's unusual and many questions will be asked
MichalakisCon	716919630401376256	2016-04-04T09:25:34	4. So an active offshore market sprang up. Important to note that the insto buying that fund eg say a super fund will file and pay tax in oz
MichalakisCon	716919245020332032	2016-04-04T09:24:02	3. Also tax made it terrible for offshore investors to buy local ones - ie 10% rule etc
MichalakisCon	716918999691333632	2016-04-04T09:23:03	2. Therefore feeder funds set up for offshore investors. Quickly became Lux, Dublin or Cayman type vehicles
MichalakisCon	716918746229571584	2016-04-04T09:22:03	1, many insto precluded from buying the onshore version by the either their domestic or fund managers regulator

MichalakisCon	694047032428724224	2016-02-01T06:38:01	macromusing and what's your definition of a bubble ??
MichalakisCon	694046864782438400	2016-02-01T06:37:21	macromusing yes but did you make or lose money and or keep your job and or keep clients ....??
