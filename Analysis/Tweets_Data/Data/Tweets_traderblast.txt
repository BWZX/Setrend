traderblast	685111457738919936	2016-01-07T14:51:14	D_ENGEL000 JustinPulitzer I think JP could be correct- FCX could be a buy right here but we'll wait a bit to add-already unwater a bit.
traderblast	685110510551891968	2016-01-07T14:47:29	D_ENGEL000 JustinPulitzer FCX Hi David-that's even better. This is -imo-a GREAT long term hold but it can get below $4 now. btw Happy NY!
