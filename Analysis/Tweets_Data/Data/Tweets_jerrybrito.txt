jerrybrito	718237213717307392	2016-04-08T00:41:10	oocBlog Agreed.
jerrybrito	718228310082371584	2016-04-08T00:05:47	SDLerner Do you mean Satoshi signed a tx to Trammel? Or that he PGP-signed a message to Trammel? In either case, how do you know? Thanks.

jerrybrito	718193766419537920	2016-04-07T21:48:31	EthereumNetNews I have found no such signed correspondence. I don’t think it exists.
jerrybrito	718193465562161153	2016-04-07T21:47:20	_drgo Yeah, just noticed that. Limits of my crypto knowledge fast approaching!
jerrybrito	718193051387228161	2016-04-07T21:45:41	EthereumNetNews There’s still no evidence Satoshi ever used it to sign or encrypt anything.
jerrybrito	718192961318752256	2016-04-07T21:45:20	EthereumNetNews That’s the same key that’s been on  since at least 2011, so no surprise Dillinger has it.

jerrybrito	718173247628517378	2016-04-07T20:26:59	EthereumNetNews Just checked, there was no correspondence w/ wikileaks. It was a public posting. 
jerrybrito	718172432868188160	2016-04-07T20:23:45	_drgo I wouldn’t be satisfied.
jerrybrito	718171000605646848	2016-04-07T20:18:04	_drgo Yes, but anyone can vouch. There are random people there vouching and dating in 1995! Means nothing really.
jerrybrito	718170643741728768	2016-04-07T20:16:39	EthereumNetNews Well, more accurate to say they have correspondence from someone signing with that key. :) Thanks for tip!

jerrybrito	718166555616477184	2016-04-07T20:00:24	petertoddbtc Understood, but in that GitHub thread you ask for ACK from someone who has corresponded w/ Satoshi &amp; gavinandresen does. 1/2
