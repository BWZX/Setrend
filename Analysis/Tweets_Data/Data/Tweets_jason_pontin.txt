jason_pontin	723220007841337344	2016-04-21T18:41:01	Erik_Boielle I honestly think that's your bag.
jason_pontin	723215402243739651	2016-04-21T18:22:43	Ah, well.  
jason_pontin	723210386162483200	2016-04-21T18:02:47	Erik_Boielle In fairness, because that would sound white identity to most people. And white identity politics = toothbrush mustaches.

jason_pontin	723189619727032320	2016-04-21T16:40:16	Erik_Boielle Your objection is that the character on the far right is vaguely non-white? Isn't the middle character in the top panel black?
jason_pontin	723186914132549634	2016-04-21T16:29:31	Erik_Boielle Your objection is what? That the middle character is a girl?
jason_pontin	723179257334140929	2016-04-21T15:59:05	Dan_Rowinski Well, if they apparently don't know the origin of the word, maybe.
jason_pontin	723179157501280257	2016-04-21T15:58:41	Dan_Rowinski There was no real point except that the writer was anti-elitist and that elites thought they weren't just better but *right*.
jason_pontin	723177091466850306	2016-04-21T15:50:29	Dan_Rowinski 2/ It only says (very laboriously): "Ain't I democratic and anti-elitist?"
jason_pontin	723176873186848768	2016-04-21T15:49:37	Dan_Rowinski It's unimaginably long. It's also a bad, self-regarding pastiche of "The Paranoid Style in American Politics."

jason_pontin	723123740867985408	2016-04-21T12:18:29	jcstearns JenniferBrandel andrewhaeg 2/ Instead, editors must talk quietly, intimately with a reader as if she were a smart person.

jason_pontin	723111494246912000	2016-04-21T11:29:49	More temperately: the best way to build a smart audience is to treat your readers as if they were really smart. 
jason_pontin	723110652794032128	2016-04-21T11:26:29	JenniferBrandel 2/ And that the main way publications get "idiot" audiences is to scramble for eyeballs, treating their readers as idiots.

jason_pontin	716270376922312704	2016-04-02T14:25:40	electronicoffee camacph These MRA categories like"betas" and "white knights" are ridiculous. Women laugh at them. You know that, right?

jason_pontin	716239356088999937	2016-04-02T12:22:24	AmbikaPadmaloch That's different from grabbing someone weaker than you who is not conceivably a threat. Distinctions are important.
jason_pontin	716237916972978176	2016-04-02T12:16:41	AmbikaPadmaloch Cernovich y4zix I mean, you must know that you're crossing a kind of moral line.

jason_pontin	716236816903454720	2016-04-02T12:12:18	AmbikaPadmaloch Cernovich He grabbed her, hard, and pulled her. We don't do that to non-threatening journalists in civilized societies.
jason_pontin	716233791887515648	2016-04-02T12:00:17	AmbikaPadmaloch CLewandowski_ Cernovich And it's an unforced error: all she wanted was an admission and apology.

jason_pontin	716048749131403264	2016-04-01T23:44:59	Jeffrey_of_Troy Cernovich The simplest explanation is that she's telling the truth. "Do not multiply things beyond necessity."

jason_pontin	716018565120462852	2016-04-01T21:45:03	There are lots of people on Twitter who hate women, especially young women, particularly if they stand up to men.
jason_pontin	716004558896545793	2016-04-01T20:49:24	Cernovich OK, that right there is where this theory gets nuts. Fame is not the #1 goal of most women &lt;30.

jason_pontin	716001048251465728	2016-04-01T20:35:27	Cernovich OK, but *why* would she do it? Why would anyone want such fame? Doesn't Occam's razor recommend that she was, actually, hurt?
jason_pontin	715998559456378880	2016-04-01T20:25:33	Cernovich She's not trying to send an innocent man to jail to gain publicity. That's just nuts.

jason_pontin	715910517567709184	2016-04-01T14:35:43	2/ Any other suggestions? The writer should be scientifically literate, not an activist, and herself or himself a transwoman or man.

jason_pontin	715893092826656768	2016-04-01T13:26:28	2/ The explanation is not immiseration, as bien pensants say. It's all authoritarianism, all the time. It's what his people want.

jason_pontin	697233982220607488	2016-02-10T01:41:49	scottinfukie The "great decoupling" is not the result of currency manipulation or any inflationary policy.

jason_pontin	697230254159560705	2016-02-10T01:27:01	scottinfukie Well, cap and trade is a very bad policy alternative: not-transparent, not very responsive, easily manipulated, etc.
jason_pontin	697229822238552068	2016-02-10T01:25:18	tan123 mangan_mike scottinfukie MacnTsDaddy Feedback isn't negative in aggregate globally.
jason_pontin	697229641539526656	2016-02-10T01:24:35	scottinfukie 2/ Who cares? It's runaway inflation, where wages decouple from prices that we care about.
jason_pontin	697229354544324609	2016-02-10T01:23:26	scottinfukie technically, inflation is a reduction in purchasing power. But I mean: it's in the nature of a unit of currency to buy less.
jason_pontin	697228443226918912	2016-02-10T01:19:49	scottinfukie I just don't accept that: I could design a dozen policies that would disproportionately favor the poor.
jason_pontin	697228238028959744	2016-02-10T01:19:00	mangan_mike scottinfukie MacnTsDaddy tan123 At least, in aggregate.

jason_pontin	697226995965501441	2016-02-10T01:14:04	scottinfukie Well, I'm to all policy prescriptions, but I think the market signal should be as transparent as possible.

jason_pontin	697053337611542529	2016-02-09T13:44:00	scottinfukie MacnTsDaddy tan123 But acceptance of the science shouldn't be driven by ideological fears.
jason_pontin	697053085089271808	2016-02-09T13:43:00	scottinfukie MacnTsDaddy tan123 We can have a great policy debate about such issues: for instance, a carbon tax could be neutral.
jason_pontin	697052402420154368	2016-02-09T13:40:18	gregkrehbiel I don't understand this right-wing argument. The change has changed in the past. But *we're* changing it now, quickly.
jason_pontin	697051483506868224	2016-02-09T13:36:38	scottinfukie MacnTsDaddy tan123 Well, the pace we burn fossil fuel reserves will contribute to how fast and how bad it will all be.

jason_pontin	697048748292182017	2016-02-09T13:25:46	scottinfukie MacnTsDaddy tan123 No. Physics is why you should worry.

jason_pontin	697037620233314305	2016-02-09T12:41:33	tan123 No, I'm claiming "at least x and as much as y". But x is not, in aggregate, a few years or decades.
jason_pontin	697037327370219521	2016-02-09T12:40:23	gregorybritten tan123 There are many, many such studies: measuring duration, decay, etc., are an observable phenomena.
jason_pontin	697036442028134400	2016-02-09T12:36:52	MacnTsDaddy tan123 Well, I'm definitionally right about whether the IPCC is an outlier about CO2 duration: it just aggregates.
jason_pontin	697034116940877824	2016-02-09T12:27:38	MacnTsDaddy tan123 All IPCC does is present the consensus view: what could be agreed to by its members.
jason_pontin	697033815559184384	2016-02-09T12:26:26	MacnTsDaddy tan123 The chart misleadingly seeks to portray IPCC as an outlier on duration by comparing it's data to actual outliers.
jason_pontin	697032368239079424	2016-02-09T12:20:41	MacnTsDaddy tan123 IPCC is *just* the consensus view; that's all it is. It's what the participants would sign their names to.
jason_pontin	697030597835952128	2016-02-09T12:13:39	MacnTsDaddy tan123 The chart is deliberately misleading: there is a strong consensus on the range of atmospheric persistence of CO2.
