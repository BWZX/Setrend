BoingBoing	721085977343692800	2016-04-15T21:21:08	Here's Apple's latest filing in EDNY iPhone case.   
BoingBoing	721087040935358464	2016-04-15T21:25:22	Apple: San Bernardino case "calls into question the credibility" of DOJ's claim that it can't unlock phones itself. 
BoingBoing	721088169308004352	2016-04-15T21:29:51	Basically, Apple says the feds have demanded its help when they haven't tried very hard to unlock phones themselves. 
BoingBoing	721085212617228289	2016-04-15T21:18:06	Apple says N.Y. case isn't about one iPhone. It anticipates "an avalanche of similar data access requests." 
BoingBoing	721081398602440705	2016-04-15T21:02:57	Apple: Maybe DOJ could ask the suspect (who's now pleaded guilty) for his iPhone passcode instead of making us help. 
BoingBoing	721080920560820229	2016-04-15T21:01:03	Apple says DOJ "has utterly failed" to show that it needs the company's help to unlock an iPhone in N.Y. drug case.
