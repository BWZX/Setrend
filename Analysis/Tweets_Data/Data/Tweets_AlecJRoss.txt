AlecJRoss	708772418928689152	2016-03-12T21:51:27	4/4 If realDonaldTrump's rise continues, we should grow MORE confrontational. And I look forward to being a part of it. God Bless America.

AlecJRoss	693967676876722176	2016-02-01T01:22:42	JennyQTa9 elitism is an inevitable byproduct of decades of success. I'm not saying it's good (obviously) 1st sentence of book will show you
AlecJRoss	693967275569868801	2016-02-01T01:21:06	trassens that is certainly true
AlecJRoss	693962624506142720	2016-02-01T01:02:37	itendr read the book. No man crush. I highlight plenty of places of disagreement. Enjoy the book! 
AlecJRoss	693962162029596673	2016-02-01T01:00:47	erick_butler there will be more places that innovate and create jobs and wealth but Silicon Valley still has a ton going for it.
AlecJRoss	693961889735430149	2016-02-01T00:59:42	erick_butler numbered? Put down the crack pipe.
AlecJRoss	693960959556198400	2016-02-01T00:56:00	JennyQTa9 but read the book and you'll get the full thinking.
AlecJRoss	693960858238611457	2016-02-01T00:55:36	JennyQTa9 also, EVERY place that has been successful has elitism, but Silicon Valley is easier to break in to based on merit than most.
AlecJRoss	693960615640109057	2016-02-01T00:54:38	JennyQTa9 I'm not agreeing with you --- I wrote a 100,000 word book with my own thoughts ;)
AlecJRoss	693958746452672512	2016-02-01T00:47:12	JennyQTa9 I think that the "global foci" for innovation will spread well beyond Silicon Valley. Book out Tuesday

AlecJRoss	693455313035485185	2016-01-30T15:26:45	My review of AlecJRoss's important new book, The Industries of the Future. 
AlecJRoss	693478674134241280	2016-01-30T16:59:34	nikhilgoya_l Good. Techies think it's too negative/dark. Bedwetters think it's too positive. Will look fwd to your thoughts.
AlecJRoss	693478273968263168	2016-01-30T16:57:59	A critical take on my book The Industries of the Future   Lots to ponder here.  
AlecJRoss	693477956409122817	2016-01-30T16:56:43	nikhilgoya_l "Unlike the typical techno-utopian fantasy or luddite jeremiad, Ross strikes a calm tone, never ceasing to consider...."

AlecJRoss	693477157373214720	2016-01-30T16:53:33	Silicon Valley dominated the world for 20 years. Who wins in the next 20 years, though, is still a very big question

AlecJRoss	693429974326325249	2016-01-30T13:46:03	mfullilove This is one of the (maybe THE) boldest predictions, but in 10 year timeframe I believe it can be true.
