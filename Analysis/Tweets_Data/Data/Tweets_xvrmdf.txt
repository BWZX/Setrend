xvrmdf	684486442760974337	2016-01-05T21:27:39	NoonSixCap Painful in the short-term, but I tend to think FX risk washes out in the long-term for a global portfolio.
xvrmdf	684484600274501632	2016-01-05T21:20:20	ALLY asset quality looks reasonable too, with losses on more recent vintages roughly in line with seasoned ones. 
xvrmdf	684483537345638400	2016-01-05T21:16:07	The liability side of the ALLY balance sheet looks to be in decent shape. 
xvrmdf	684482675231555585	2016-01-05T21:12:41	NoonSixCap I'm a lender. My take is that ~70% FX, 20% other temporary headwinds driving the downgrades. FY16 should be better.

xvrmdf	684481613242220545	2016-01-05T21:08:28	For a company that reckons it can generate 10% ROTCE &amp; 15% EPS CAGR, 0.76x P/TBV seems like an odd valuation. Market clearly very sceptical.
xvrmdf	684480891406651392	2016-01-05T21:05:36	Been doing some reading on ALLY following groditi's recommendation to DavidSchawel yesterday. The crux of it: 
xvrmdf	684479975756529664	2016-01-05T21:01:57	Seems WhatsApp is pulling in data from a business card scanning app.

xvrmdf	684465353192304640	2016-01-05T20:03:51	conorsen That's another great point. More money passive = more money blindly voting with management, diluting corporate governance.
xvrmdf	684464592622325760	2016-01-05T20:00:50	conorsen People have taken the (correct) "median manager can't beat index after fees" theorem to mean "active managers can't add value".
xvrmdf	684464005784666112	2016-01-05T19:58:30	conorsen This is the height of stupidity in credit as the most (over)indebted firms have the highest index weights.
