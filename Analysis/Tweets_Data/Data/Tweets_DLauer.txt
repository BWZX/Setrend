DLauer	720967584607248384	2016-04-15T13:30:41	DeepSkyMaven In fact, the article is doing exactly what it accuses Bernie of doing - demonizing / ad hom attacks, and ignoring real issues.
DLauer	720967357288607744	2016-04-15T13:29:47	DeepSkyMaven I just don't like the solutions he's proposed.
DLauer	720967282999083008	2016-04-15T13:29:29	DeepSkyMaven But the corruption of campaign finance, revolving door and TBTF is a tremendous problem. He's right on that.
DLauer	720967121895890945	2016-04-15T13:28:51	DeepSkyMaven I think that's over-simplifying Bernie's points. I don't think he's argued that or believes that.
DLauer	720966833914978308	2016-04-15T13:27:42	DeepSkyMaven And being a capitalist, I prefer to have companies fail, rather than bailed out by tax payers.

DLauer	720965938946908160	2016-04-15T13:24:09	DeepSkyMaven They didn't nearly destroy our economy. They haven't become an outsized portion of GDP. Also, oil industry is often attacked.
DLauer	720964750876794881	2016-04-15T13:19:26	DeepSkyMaven I agree with you that demonizing people in the industry is wrong. But the broader point is hard to argue.
DLauer	720964669058494464	2016-04-15T13:19:06	DeepSkyMaven I think the public has a right to be angry at any industry that socializes failure but privatizes success.

DLauer	697150205477650432	2016-02-09T20:08:56	mechmarkets I don't have any insight on this.
DLauer	697138716129755137	2016-02-09T19:23:16	mechmarkets I think so.
DLauer	697131715991629824	2016-02-09T18:55:27	mechmarkets Not sure. I'd argue it doesn't. We'll find out what the SEC thinks soon enough.
DLauer	697129955130482691	2016-02-09T18:48:28	mechmarkets I find it very weird that venues should be FORCED to allow firms to pay to circumvent their speed bumps.
DLauer	697129644160638976	2016-02-09T18:47:13	mechmarkets Of course it's a great idea - but you know it wouldn't stand a chance as it would threaten SRO revenues.
DLauer	697126589478408194	2016-02-09T18:35:05	mechmarkets And if the price was double the highest price? Triple? Regulators are supposed to be setting price controls?
DLauer	697126021213069313	2016-02-09T18:32:50	mechmarkets If they allow firms to pay to circumvent the speed bump, their model is identical to every exch that offers co-lo, yes?
DLauer	697125919182422016	2016-02-09T18:32:25	mechmarkets I think everyone agrees. But again, back to my point, why would IEX need to be reasonably priced? Isn't this philosophical?
DLauer	697125231463428096	2016-02-09T18:29:41	mechmarkets But haven't DFs and co-lo pricing become less and less reasonable? Doesn't appear to be much of a limit.
DLauer	697124626439266304	2016-02-09T18:27:17	mechmarkets Why should it depend on the price? As long as you can pay, "anyone can access it" right?
DLauer	697123064191049728	2016-02-09T18:21:05	So nobody wants to comment on this? Is it b/c you've run through it in your head &amp; realize exactly where it leads? 
DLauer	697115905680089088	2016-02-09T17:52:38	If IEX provided the ability for firms to pay to circumvent the speed bump, would you still have a problem with it?

DLauer	693175362533064704	2016-01-29T20:54:19	DeepSkyMaven ChristopherNagy also don't believe it matters anyway,as I don't know why everyone is so passionate to help active day traders
DLauer	693175109864067076	2016-01-29T20:53:19	DeepSkyMaven ChristopherNagy Like I said, I have no idea, all I know is what they said after Senate hearing.

DLauer	693172452436905985	2016-01-29T20:42:45	DeepSkyMaven ChristopherNagy These numbers are non-sensical. I don't know what net improvement means, but they are not giving 0.0146 in PI
DLauer	693169991810748416	2016-01-29T20:32:59	DeepSkyMaven ChristopherNagy I have no idea what their #'s will look like for 2015, they have only fully disclosed #'s for 2014.
DLauer	693167672893243392	2016-01-29T20:23:46	DeepSkyMaven ChristopherNagy dude, the PI each order receives is de-minimus. This is what TDA disclosed after Senate PSI hearing.
DLauer	693166693208756224	2016-01-29T20:19:52	DeepSkyMaven ChristopherNagy In 2014, TDA received $80M from equity PFOF ($236M total) and gave $16M of PI. That's what they've disclosed.
DLauer	693166559876005890	2016-01-29T20:19:20	DeepSkyMaven ChristopherNagy Wouldn't it be amazing if there were some sort of standardized disclosure to evaluate this? There's not.
DLauer	693165315858022400	2016-01-29T20:14:24	DeepSkyMaven ChristopherNagy For equities, yes.
DLauer	693163412709335040	2016-01-29T20:06:50	DeepSkyMaven ChristopherNagy Huh? These are on market orders. They got $16M in savings.
DLauer	693163004712591360	2016-01-29T20:05:13	DeepSkyMaven ChristopherNagy Also in 2014 AMTD paid $16M in PI, received $236M in PFOF. Hmmm.
DLauer	693162797295898624	2016-01-29T20:04:23	DeepSkyMaven ChristopherNagy discount brokers represent active traders not mom-and-pop retail. Mutual funds and ETFs represent real retail
DLauer	693162513140154368	2016-01-29T20:03:16	DeepSkyMaven ChristopherNagy shouldn't necessarily be a reason to damage market quality and chase away market makers.

DLauer	693161436382695424	2016-01-29T19:58:59	DeepSkyMaven I agree with you. Why should wholesalers benefit to the detriment of the market as a whole?
DLauer	693161297928650753	2016-01-29T19:58:26	DeepSkyMaven Totally different. Lit markets can't satisfy institutional orders w/o market impact, so dark pools have a critical role.
DLauer	693160045568212992	2016-01-29T19:53:27	DeepSkyMaven This evolution happened without study of the unintended consequences of siphoning off the most valuable order flow.
DLauer	693159964010004481	2016-01-29T19:53:08	DeepSkyMaven Nobody is entitled to it! It should hit the lit market and market makers should compete for it. You know, capitalism.
DLauer	693159188793548801	2016-01-29T19:50:03	DeepSkyMaven Of course they do. Because by capturing all of the uninformed order flow, they've killed lit market makers.
DLauer	693157888701890560	2016-01-29T19:44:53	DeepSkyMaven Huge difference. Increases lit market diversity, improves order book stability and market quality overall.
DLauer	693157761727733760	2016-01-29T19:44:23	DeepSkyMaven Wholesalers being profitable only helps the wholesaler. Lit market makers being profitable helps the entire market.

DLauer	693116496839622658	2016-01-29T17:00:24	nanexllc ThemisSal cromwellc It's worse. It's passing judgement on IEX "quantitatively" w/o considering the platform's best feature.
DLauer	693116252940849152	2016-01-29T16:59:26	RemcoLenterman I can't really speak to that. I can say that wholesalers see threat from midpt pricing, which is not captured on the IEX 605
DLauer	693115989001682944	2016-01-29T16:58:23	RemcoLenterman Discount brokers represent active traders. Not retirement savings.
DLauer	693115923776065538	2016-01-29T16:58:08	RemcoLenterman I'm not going to speak to that. But retail != discount broker. Retail is invested in mutual funds and ETFs.
DLauer	693114155595894784	2016-01-29T16:51:06	Nobody has studied if the benefits to active traders outweighs the damage to the market. You'd think regulators would be interested in that.
DLauer	693114112340037632	2016-01-29T16:50:56	That makes markets more fragile, more self-similar, and affects all participants.
DLauer	693114036548956164	2016-01-29T16:50:38	It makes market makers less like to participate, drives some away when their orders get "queue jumped". Reduces market diversity.
DLauer	693113909860024320	2016-01-29T16:50:08	PFOF siphons off most profitable order flow, removes it from lit mkts. This directly impacts mkt maker profitability, impacting mkt quality.
DLauer	693113872039964672	2016-01-29T16:49:59	Second, there is no doubt that these active traders get a good deal. That's not the issue. The issue is the damage to the market.
DLauer	693113823776079872	2016-01-29T16:49:47	First, discount brokers are not mom-and-pop retail. They are active traders. The overwhelming majority of profits come from active traders.
DLauer	693113752166764546	2016-01-29T16:49:30	So many flaws in the arguments of those who defend PFOF and current retail model. (1/5)
DLauer	693113166696431616	2016-01-29T16:47:11	RemcoLenterman I can't believe anyone argues against open competition for order flow. ThemisSal cromwellc daveweisberger
DLauer	693110496476663808	2016-01-29T16:36:34	mechmarkets cromwellc That's a big reason why they're protesting IEX, when combined with FINRA's new best ex guidance.
DLauer	693110355753594881	2016-01-29T16:36:00	mechmarkets cromwellc No - but their market orders wld hit resting midpt pegs, resulting in far more price improvement than wholesalers.
DLauer	693109803669950464	2016-01-29T16:33:49	Huge problem with this analysis. Based on 605 data, which does not include IEX midpoint orders (74% of fills). cromwellc

DLauer	692357207011282947	2016-01-27T14:43:16	nanexllc you might enjoy this article I wrote about how to quantify millisecond-level message bursts in 2008:

DLauer	692353720718344193	2016-01-27T14:29:24	ThemisSal But what I'm trying to tell you is feed delays came about because of a crazy amount of trading, which SIP infra couldn't handle
DLauer	692350763822137344	2016-01-27T14:17:40	ThemisSal The more I read the more I believe you are mistaking correlation for causation. The authors acknowledge as much in the paper.
DLauer	692349352283631616	2016-01-27T14:12:03	RemcoLenterman Well at least the CME disagrees with you. I'll spend more time on this later.
DLauer	692347626289782785	2016-01-27T14:05:11	RemcoLenterman Sounds familiar. 
DLauer	692347217080901633	2016-01-27T14:03:34	RemcoLenterman Did you read the paper? 
DLauer	692346632923385856	2016-01-27T14:01:15	RemcoLenterman I'm reading the paper now. There's a lot of correlation vs causation in here that I question.
DLauer	692343747418390529	2016-01-27T13:49:47	RemcoLenterman and I will always put "cause" in quotes when talking about non-linear, complex adaptive systems.
DLauer	692343640648241153	2016-01-27T13:49:21	RemcoLenterman I'm not saying it wasn't big, I'm just saying it wasn't the "cause"
DLauer	692343560620867584	2016-01-27T13:49:02	RemcoLenterman I don't have time today, but there have been other similarly sized orders since, and there were others before.
DLauer	692343296606244864	2016-01-27T13:47:59	ThemisSal RemcoLenterman increasing self-similarity of market making strategies. That's why there's no cause-and-effect here.
DLauer	692343226284560384	2016-01-27T13:47:42	ThemisSal RemcoLenterman There have been other sell orders since. You can't separate that "order" from the prevailing conditions, and
DLauer	692343022093275136	2016-01-27T13:46:54	RemcoLenterman You know this issue well enough to know that there's no simple explanation, and W&amp;R isn't the answer.
DLauer	692342874994794496	2016-01-27T13:46:19	RemcoLenterman Right, like those other times similar sized orders did the same thing.
DLauer	692342814580015106	2016-01-27T13:46:04	ThemisSal I believe PFOF is a root-cause issue. Get rid of it, increase market maker profitability, and increase participant diversity.
DLauer	692342603921104897	2016-01-27T13:45:14	ThemisSal That contributed to a further feedback loop, etc etc. Again, complex systems, no direct cause-and-effect.
DLauer	692342508412604417	2016-01-27T13:44:51	ThemisSal the non-linear feedback loop created by lack of diverse participants led to huge trading volumes, which overwhelmed SIP systems.
DLauer	692342400040210432	2016-01-27T13:44:25	ThemisSal I think the paper confuses causality. The feed discrepancies were magnified by the huge amount of trading.
DLauer	692342176974528516	2016-01-27T13:43:32	ThemisSal It's actually not so math-y. But this is important. Without understanding complexity of systems, we're doomed to keep repeating.
DLauer	692341765249093632	2016-01-27T13:41:54	RemcoLenterman Come on. You know that's absurd.
DLauer	692341154243854336	2016-01-27T13:39:28	ThemisSal That the Flash Crash was a non-linear feedback loop, and therefore linear causality cannot be established.
DLauer	692340700357246976	2016-01-27T13:37:40	ThemisSal Um - you left out a very important (and many would say the correct) option.
