sacca	688194024415432704	2016-01-16T03:00:16	They got a deal! Congrats to lorigreiner and beardking. That was a fun pitch and I admire the hustle of those founders.
sacca	688193550681415680	2016-01-16T02:58:23	Never. Stop. Selling. SharkTank
sacca	688193112787664897	2016-01-16T02:56:38	.hatchbaby sacca    Good things come to those who weight! SharkTank 
sacca	688192475664535552	2016-01-16T02:54:06	‚ÄúBefore you go out, would you make us an offer?‚Äù I love the gumption of these two beardking founders. Entrepreneurs: take note. SharkTank
sacca	688192205261897729	2016-01-16T02:53:02	"How do I get my money back?‚Äù ‚ÄúBy investing in us.‚Äù These two are relentless. They never ease up. Selling until they close.
sacca	688191746455371777	2016-01-16T02:51:12	These two are very likable and have built a legit product solving a real problem. It‚Äôs kinda goofy, but I‚Äôm intrigued. SharkTank
sacca	688191563386638337	2016-01-16T02:50:29	What the edit doesn‚Äôt show is that I actually got up and tried the beardking. I mean, it‚Äôs not rocket science, but it does work well.
sacca	688190922996109312	2016-01-16T02:47:56	No doubt, crystale gives me grief when my beard clippings fall all over the bathroom. I get the problem BeardKing is trying to solve.

sacca	688189495359885312	2016-01-16T02:42:16	As the pitch went on, they started bringing in all of these different business ideas. Ambition with no focus is a red flag. Out.
sacca	688183598801784832	2016-01-16T02:18:50	Chris Sacca says UBER more than Giuliani says 9/11. SharkTank sacca

sacca	688189180703186944	2016-01-16T02:41:01	darrenrovell 1.
sacca	688189062910324738	2016-01-16T02:40:33	Sharp founders, but this pitch feels way too early. Frankly, it feels too early for even a business plan competition. SharkTank
sacca	688188072161247232	2016-01-16T02:36:36	I like seeing ABCSharkTank bringing more diverse founders onto the show. It‚Äôs important.
sacca	688187341890949120	2016-01-16T02:33:42	Go now to  and get a special SharkTank deal on a hatchbaby: $100 off!
sacca	688187266896773121	2016-01-16T02:33:24	When our new daughter arrived this Fall, we got one of the first hatchbaby units. It put us immediately at ease. Huge relief.
sacca	688187072021057537	2016-01-16T02:32:38	Ann, the CEO, couldn‚Äôt be stronger. Dave, her co-founder, is bulletproof, and the product is getting rave reviews. hatchbaby wins.
sacca	688187008494125056	2016-01-16T02:32:23	Deal! Proud to be a hatchbaby investor. Since working with them, they‚Äôve quickly become one of my favorite companies ever. SharkTank
sacca	688186669061689346	2016-01-16T02:31:02	I know the need for this product, and there is no other founder I would want to back in this space. But, at $10m, the price is too rich.
sacca	688186259278176256	2016-01-16T02:29:24	I love when the other Sharks bristle about the cost of the hatchbaby. They have no idea what successful baby products cost. Advantage: Me
sacca	688186050619965440	2016-01-16T02:28:35	This CEO is a badass. Serial entrepreneur. Sold a company to J&amp;J and then ran product &amp; eng at the #1 company in the baby space. Leaning in.
sacca	688185827231285250	2016-01-16T02:27:41	I don‚Äôt care that they haven‚Äôt sold any products yet. None of my best investments were making money when I invested. SharkTank
sacca	688185720461119488	2016-01-16T02:27:16	As the other Sharks ask questions, it‚Äôs clear they are out of touch with what new moms and dads feel. That's an opportunity for me.
sacca	688184562539597826	2016-01-16T02:22:40	Stoked to meet Ann &amp; Dave from hatchbaby. Anyone building a tech company while in the three-kid club gets my full attention.
sacca	688183025939566596	2016-01-16T02:16:33	Hurts to admit this but MCuban really is responsive to SharkTank portfolio company emails. I have seen it firsthand. Respect.
sacca	688181614807916548	2016-01-16T02:10:57	When the Sharks deny a future of self-driving cars, I feel confident as ever I am going to beat them up and take their money on this show.
sacca	688181506041237509	2016-01-16T02:10:31	This guy just started pitching a second business, the legal services referral business. I always cringe when the pitch loses focus.
