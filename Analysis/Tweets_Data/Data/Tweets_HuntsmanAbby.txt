HuntsmanAbby	705544988843765760	2016-03-04T00:06:48	If it's true Romney secretly plans to block Trump at convention, there's a very real possibility it could backfire on him. We shall see..
HuntsmanAbby	705530722921160709	2016-03-03T23:10:07	A lot of talk abt Romney blocking Trump at convention, but if Trump has the votes that's a democracy, whether people like it or not. No?

HuntsmanAbby	705436402725449728	2016-03-03T16:55:19	Of course realDonaldTrump campaign theme is Rage Against the Machine, so perhaps Mitt Romney (The Machine) only fueled the Rage with that.
HuntsmanAbby	705436460573433856	2016-03-03T16:55:33	How many times did MittRomney watched iamjohnoliver 's DonaldDrumpf segment?

HuntsmanAbby	705434672315166721	2016-03-03T16:48:26	I do wonder what Rubio really thinks of Romney's speech?
HuntsmanAbby	705433586556657664	2016-03-03T16:44:08	It really does sound like this is Romney's attempt to prove he's the adult in the room to save the day. Again, all very confusing.
HuntsmanAbby	705432720999096320	2016-03-03T16:40:41	Big question: does Romney's speech pounding Trump play right into Trump's hands? Or will it have an impact?
HuntsmanAbby	705432030927003649	2016-03-03T16:37:57	This is all very confusing...sounds an awful lot like a campaign speech? Romney

HuntsmanAbby	699721293420236800	2016-02-16T22:25:31	Can't help but wonder who would be leading the polls right now if Trump never jump in the race. Amazing the impact one human being can have.

HuntsmanAbby	699383035175772162	2016-02-16T00:01:24	Jeb should keep his brother tied to his hip the next 6 days in SC. GWB clearly brings out a confidence and comfort in his brother.
HuntsmanAbby	699382170150948864	2016-02-15T23:57:57	I will say Jeb had an energy and a spirit about him no one seems to have seen so far in this campaign. Certainly not in the debates.
HuntsmanAbby	699377290057224196	2016-02-15T23:38:34	This entire speech for Jeb has been aimed directly at Trump, without ever mentioning his name directly. politics

HuntsmanAbby	699375487244771328	2016-02-15T23:31:24	GWB will no doubt help give Jeb a much needed boost, question is how much? South Carolina will be make or break for him.

HuntsmanAbby	699374619573252098	2016-02-15T23:27:57	At the very least GWB is giving his brother Jeb some much needed air time. Probably should have brought them out months ago.

HuntsmanAbby	694279678211801089	2016-02-01T22:02:29	It means everything.  
HuntsmanAbby	694245870229856256	2016-02-01T19:48:08	According to BillHemmer the last time Dems caucused in IA (2008) iPhone was only 6 months old. Wow we are getting old! IowaCaucus
HuntsmanAbby	694245196867964929	2016-02-01T19:45:28	Curious to see if Santorum and Huckabee get out tonight if things end badly, even more curious to see who they end up endorsing.
HuntsmanAbby	694168239681748992	2016-02-01T14:39:40	Incredible on so many levels! You nailed it too MarioLopezExtra. Best live tv musical I've seen! üëè

HuntsmanAbby	693969945315667969	2016-02-01T01:31:42	Is this really Boyz II Men playing the Teen Angels in GreaseLive? I feel like I'm in a dream right now this is just too good.

HuntsmanAbby	693941938953805824	2016-01-31T23:40:25	Like anything in life, people like to get behind the person most likely to "win." If Trump takes IA tomorrow, very tough to slow him down.
HuntsmanAbby	693939238287597568	2016-01-31T23:29:41	I feel strongly that GreaseLive will affect the outcome of tomorrow's caucus  How? No idea  But mark my word

HuntsmanAbby	693828041403994112	2016-01-31T16:07:50	Interesting to ponder how different this race would have been if Trump never entered. Where would Bush be for example?
HuntsmanAbby	693825486007488512	2016-01-31T15:57:41	I'm not in the betting business, but this race could be unlike anything we've experienced before.  
HuntsmanAbby	693821948716027904	2016-01-31T15:43:37	Listening to a lot of political pundits overly confident about what they think is going to happen in IA/NH. I wouldn't be so sure.
