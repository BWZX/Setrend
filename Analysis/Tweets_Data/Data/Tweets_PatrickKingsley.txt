PatrickKingsley	694877870213197824	2016-02-03T13:39:29	silver_argyro the slightly insidious thing is that this is nevertheless being presented as THE long-term solution.
PatrickKingsley	694877532441677824	2016-02-03T13:38:08	Anyway, here is the piece again. 
PatrickKingsley	694877358759809024	2016-02-03T13:37:27	Aid should not be presented as an alternative to resettlement, or an alternative to greater solidarity betwn EU states. It is a compliment.
PatrickKingsley	694877003917430787	2016-02-03T13:36:02	So let's be realistic. This aid is vital. But it should not be presented, as DFID does, as a silver-bullet – much less the only one.
PatrickKingsley	694876673645395968	2016-02-03T13:34:43	Meanwhile Lebanon is even less disposed to changing its labour laws for Syrians. “We refuse categorically to change a single Lebanese law."
PatrickKingsley	694876473455415297	2016-02-03T13:33:56	So it's not a game-changer. Just as importantly: even a pilot won't be ready until the summer. By which time another 300k cd have reached EU
PatrickKingsley	694875990502277121	2016-02-03T13:32:00	For those who do get work there, they'll be paid around 200 JD – no more than many get paid on the black market already.
PatrickKingsley	694875827742318592	2016-02-03T13:31:22	Most realistic scenario is that this creates 20k-30k jobs. That's good for those guys – but still leaves many in illegal employment.
PatrickKingsley	694875200123437056	2016-02-03T13:28:52	But look at the detail. One of the central planks of this plan is the creation of 5 econ zones in which Syrians get up to 70% of the jobs
PatrickKingsley	694874813140176896	2016-02-03T13:27:20	The UK calculation is that aid creates jobs which creates an incentive to stay in the Middle East.
PatrickKingsley	694874576195600384	2016-02-03T13:26:23	In short, tomorrow's aid is very important, but it is not the silver-bullet that DFID have presented it as.

PatrickKingsley	694789628029714432	2016-02-03T07:48:50	matthew1butcher That's a fair point. But if those papers were on their a-game, there's hay to be made even now.
PatrickKingsley	694789034699329536	2016-02-03T07:46:29	Yes exactly. The point is that if you're worried about the refugee crisis rearing its head: it already has.

PatrickKingsley	686655838031884288	2016-01-11T21:08:03	LizSly but I think people find it easier to understand this category, hence focussing on people coming from transit countries

PatrickKingsley	686538032414081024	2016-01-11T13:19:56	ABarnardNYT thanks!
PatrickKingsley	686537563050512384	2016-01-11T13:18:04	11) And we find ourselves back in the pre-Holocaust abyss.
PatrickKingsley	686537389133721603	2016-01-11T13:17:23	10) Or c) we get rid of the refugee convention.
PatrickKingsley	686537270787178496	2016-01-11T13:16:55	9) And that is likely to remain the case until a) Syrians are given proper status in the ME; b) West begins to resettle signif nos of them
PatrickKingsley	686536868670914560	2016-01-11T13:15:19	8) So with a heavy heart they leave the region they know, &amp; head for Europe––where they will at least be recognised as refugees with rights.
PatrickKingsley	686536032490270721	2016-01-11T13:12:00	7) Their kids won't go to school because they'll be selling flowers at the side of the road.
PatrickKingsley	686535878144094208	2016-01-11T13:11:23	6) And then people realise that unless they do something – they'll probably be living in legal limbo for the rest of their lives.
PatrickKingsley	686535521896644612	2016-01-11T13:09:58	5) And then the UN cuts its subsidies.
PatrickKingsley	686535206598217728	2016-01-11T13:08:43	4) But 5 years go by, and it turns out that the war won't end, and the west doesn't really resettle people out of choice.
PatrickKingsley	686534910149050368	2016-01-11T13:07:32	3) But hey, maybe they can weather that indignity while they wait for the war to end – or for the west to resettle them.
PatrickKingsley	686534575573614593	2016-01-11T13:06:12	2) In those countries, they were denied the right to work – a right they are supposed to have according to the 1951 refugee convention.
PatrickKingsley	686533809110646786	2016-01-11T13:03:09	These are the main reasons why Syrians are coming to Europe. 1) There is a war in Syria, so ppl first fled to neighbouring countries.
