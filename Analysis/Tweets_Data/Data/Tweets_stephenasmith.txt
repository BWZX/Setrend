stephenasmith	696547577228062720	2016-02-08T04:14:18	Love you marshallfaulk, but the rationale you're dropping -- albeit accurate -- on behalf of Cam doesn't wash. YOU CAN'T WALK OFF.
stephenasmith	696546783661522948	2016-02-08T04:11:09	Ya gotta remember: CameronNewton spent too much time celebrating. You just can't get up and walk off. Not the MVP -- the face -- of the NFL
stephenasmith	696546505017192448	2016-02-08T04:10:02	Oh Damn! CameronNewton just got up and walked off the podium. Totally understand! But you still can't do that. You just can't.ManUP
stephenasmith	696529497240268800	2016-02-08T03:02:27	It's over. Von Miller is the MVP of this game. Cam gets stripped and doesn't even dive for the ball. Steps back away from ball. It's over!
stephenasmith	696529228016324609	2016-02-08T03:01:23	A Cam mired w/ an off. Line that keeps getting penalties, can't protect him.
stephenasmith	696528938831630338	2016-02-08T03:00:14	Here's the bottom line: Peyton's not even trying to score. Instead, he's dating Cam Newton to best Denver's defense. It's on Cam now. Period

stephenasmith	696504482595737601	2016-02-08T01:23:03	Okay, Cam sacked 4 times in the 1st half. No dabbing this time around. Broncos defense showing they really are for real.uh pooh
stephenasmith	696494520943407104	2016-02-08T00:43:28	Lord have mercy. That hit Kuechley just put on D. Thomas had to give him memories of Kam Chancellor from 2 years ago.MyGoodness
stephenasmith	696487739970166790	2016-02-08T00:16:31	Another damn drop by a Panthers wide receiver. That's 3 I've already counted in this first quarter.
stephenasmith	696487466967179264	2016-02-08T00:15:26	Now Talib, what the hell is wrong with you. This is the Super Bowl damnit. You have the momentum. You don't jeopardize it with bad conduct.
stephenasmith	696487205888462849	2016-02-08T00:14:24	And who in the hell came up with the idea that a running back could block DeMarcus Ware?
stephenasmith	696486832507371521	2016-02-08T00:12:55	Ok! That's the 2nd time Cam has had a receiver open down field and missed him high.
stephenasmith	696485894409347072	2016-02-08T00:09:11	Great strip sack by Von Miller. No doubt. But it should not have even come to that. Bogus, horrible call in review by officials.

stephenasmith	691805346361425929	2016-01-26T02:10:22	That is what will make Cam the villain. It's called marketing. Someone to love/hate. If you can milk it, the NFL will do it. For those who

stephenasmith	691447170222985217	2016-01-25T02:27:06	Stupid play by Arizona. You don't know what would happen if you just sustain a drive. Palmer should've been picked off twice in same drive
stephenasmith	691442093328371712	2016-01-25T02:06:56	That was the second consecutive drop by Larry Fitzgerald

stephenasmith	691405036715425797	2016-01-24T23:39:41	Happiest person in the world right now? Commissioner Roger Goodell. He no longer has to worry about handing the Lombardi trophy to NE/Brady.
stephenasmith	691404027242754048	2016-01-24T23:35:40	Damn Shame! And Xtra point miss by Gostkowski -- one of the best -- prevents OT, cost NE in the end. Just sad
stephenasmith	691402906872979458	2016-01-24T23:31:13	Wow! TD to Gronk. This is just sensational. Special game. Living it. Praying for OT
stephenasmith	691401963402039296	2016-01-24T23:27:28	Wow! What a pass by Brady! What a catch. I could easily see Brady scoring a TD, then they don't get the 2-Pt conversion, they way this is
stephenasmith	691401553928937472	2016-01-24T23:25:50	Jesus! This pass rush
stephenasmith	691400654888267776	2016-01-24T23:22:16	Okay. 1:52 left. TD a 2-Pt conversion. These are the moments that nauseating dude RealSkipBayless brags about with Brady. We'll see now!
stephenasmith	691397011229253632	2016-01-24T23:07:47	This is suppose to be Brady's time. But this pass rush will not allow it
stephenasmith	691389473515552769	2016-01-24T22:37:50	Von Miller is playing like a man possessed. Patriots can't find anyone to deal with him 1-on-1. This is not looking good for Brady at all.

stephenasmith	691373649341894658	2016-01-24T21:34:57	This Broncos defense is no joke. Patriots offense looks flustered. Too much pressure on Brady. No running game making it worse.
stephenasmith	691371783937773571	2016-01-24T21:27:33	Okay. There's cause for concern. Another INT by Brady. In this quarter. Plus, he's tap dancing, and getting popped. I'm getting concerned!

stephenasmith	691365455144075265	2016-01-24T21:02:24	Damnit! Peyton is looking good. Getting in the way of my Cam/Brady SB encounter

stephenasmith	689152750010150917	2016-01-18T18:29:54	The Broncos LUCKED UP and beat the steelers. 
stephenasmith	689148046001762309	2016-01-18T18:11:12	I'm happy for AZCardinals. The matchup w/Panthers is much better for a NFC Championship game. 
stephenasmith	688869838911963137	2016-01-17T23:45:42	Gotta admit, Peyton Manning hasn't looked so bad. His receivers have dropped about 5 passes. Pleasantly surprised game is close.
stephenasmith	688863658693165056	2016-01-17T23:21:09	Good luck tonight to my man danawhite. Hope this event turns out to be a great one for you.

stephenasmith	688797116597055488	2016-01-17T18:56:44	Seattle's offense looking like it got its heart snatched right now.
stephenasmith	688794263358849024	2016-01-17T18:45:24	Another INT by Wilson. Okay, it's over. Already! Damn.
stephenasmith	688793457901436929	2016-01-17T18:42:12	I am absolutely, positively stunned by what I'm seeing. Seahawks haven't even shown up. They are getting steamrolled. This looks really bad
stephenasmith	688781377756614657	2016-01-17T17:54:12	The Seahawks were my Super Bowl pick at the beginning of the season &amp; I'm sticking w/them. 28-27 SEA. 
stephenasmith	688573913387929600	2016-01-17T04:09:48	Awwwwwwww Damn! Come on Aaron Rodgers. You are so much more better than that
stephenasmith	688572198735482880	2016-01-17T04:02:59	Now, I am fully aware that I picked AZCardinals to win this game vs packers. But that Baaaad Man has more than 3 min to win this game.Hmm
stephenasmith	688531242908798976	2016-01-17T01:20:15	I don't think the packers have what it takes to beat the AZCardinals.
stephenasmith	688465813020512256	2016-01-16T21:00:15	The Patriots will score just enough to win this game, 24-20.

stephenasmith	686546229589741568	2016-01-11T13:52:31	Hey Redskins fans, here's what folks are saying about y'all today: 
stephenasmith	686389792641187840	2016-01-11T03:30:53	So so happy to see my man, Denzel Washington honored tonight. No way deserves it more. A true inspiration to us all. Proud to know him.
stephenasmith	686352916110684160	2016-01-11T01:04:21	I guess this says it best, huh: 
stephenasmith	686352042982416384	2016-01-11T01:00:53	How bout this: packers fans at FedEx Field are chanting "YOU LIKE THAT! Btw....has Kirk Cousins ever beaten a winning team as a starter?
stephenasmith	686345074754465792	2016-01-11T00:33:12	A sack and two bad throws by Kirk Cousins in a much-needed scoring drive. Somehow, I don't think he'll be asking us: "YOU LIKE THAT!"
stephenasmith	686343266841706496	2016-01-11T00:26:01	The Baaaaaadddddd Man has returned. And as for you RealSkipBayless use my Twitter name when you put me in you tweets. Play by the rules :-)
stephenasmith	686327018388983808	2016-01-10T23:21:27	Here comes that Baaaaaaadddddd Man I've been waiting weeks for RealSkipBayless. Here he comes. Now let's see what the Redskins do!
stephenasmith	686314940118908929	2016-01-10T22:33:27	As for packers defense, I told y'all: I have no faith in them. Jordan Reed is a bad boy. He should have a field day.
stephenasmith	686314599184896000	2016-01-10T22:32:06	I must confess, even to RealSkipBayless: some of these receivers ARE actually open for Aaron Rodgers. He has just missed them. Period
stephenasmith	686306048295079936	2016-01-10T21:58:07	Nobody open for Aaron Rodgers. No protection from the off. Line. Redskins should have a field day.
stephenasmith	686293137694670848	2016-01-10T21:06:49	In full uniform, get in his car and drive straight the hell out of town. That is his ONLY JOB. It's an xtra pt from last season.Inexcusable
stephenasmith	686292812128636929	2016-01-10T21:05:31	Like it's alright that he missed the damn FG. He's actually worse that Hoyer right now. The kicker should run straight to the parking lot,
stephenasmith	686292556208996353	2016-01-10T21:04:30	OMg! I cannot believe the Vikings' kicker Walsh missed that chip-shot FG. Even more, I can't believe he's out there shaking hands with SEA..
stephenasmith	686291356034011136	2016-01-10T20:59:44	Bogus flag vs Kam Chancellor. Doesn't matter though. Too damn cold. Oh well!
stephenasmith	686233974260285442	2016-01-10T17:11:43	I feel very comfortable picking Seahawks. I see Seattle winning this game 19-9 over the vikings.
stephenasmith	686062212214042624	2016-01-10T05:49:12	I'll say this about Burfict: If Joey Porter was on the field cussing out Cincy players, Burfict is right that he should've been penalized.
stephenasmith	686050619606564864	2016-01-10T05:03:08	Control whatsoever. Totally disgraceful. Marvin Lewis is done
stephenasmith	686050087491997696	2016-01-10T05:01:01	Fans at the game applauding when Big Ben got hurt, throwing stuff at him. Burfict &amp; Pacman totally out of control. &amp; Marvin Lewis has no
stephenasmith	686049255207911424	2016-01-10T04:57:43	Now Adam Jones gets himself a penalty. This is so damn disgraceful I don't even know what to say.
stephenasmith	686047663897337856	2016-01-10T04:51:23	Burfict should be ejected immediately, and suspended. And if Bengals lose this game b/c of that hit, it's JUSTICE! No excuse!
stephenasmith	686043162629042185	2016-01-10T04:33:30	If the steelers lose this game, it's on Big Ben. You throw the ball away, there's no sack, you don't get hurt and u have a 15-pt cushion.
stephenasmith	686035831572815872	2016-01-10T04:04:22	Damn!!!
stephenasmith	686035803198328834	2016-01-10T04:04:16	Is it too much to ask for the Steelers to just throw the damn ball away? Big Ben gets hurt b/c he didn't do it and Landry just takes a sack!
stephenasmith	685979193419644929	2016-01-10T00:19:19	I mean, why is Hoyer still on the sidelines? Why doesn't he just leave the stadium right now, go home, pack and leave town for good!
stephenasmith	685964211911049217	2016-01-09T23:19:47	Almost another INT. We are literally at a point that if you're rooting for Houston, you're praying Hoyer doesn't even throw the ball.
stephenasmith	685960881348472832	2016-01-09T23:06:33	Job he did with Peyton Manning....who established his greatness 15 yrs b4 Gase ever stepped onto the scene? Really? I tell you, man.......
stephenasmith	685960520776728577	2016-01-09T23:05:07	On another note: so let me get this straight. Adam Case is the new HC in Miami b/c of the job he did with Peyton Manning (&amp; Cutler)? The...
stephenasmith	685958101015642112	2016-01-09T22:55:30	Another INT by Hoyer. This is one God-Awful performance. If bench him right now. Even if it's for the Waterboy
stephenasmith	685954283901161472	2016-01-09T22:40:20	Hey RealSkipBayless didn't I say Hoyer was good for at least 2 to's? That last one was horrendous. No wonder he's gone from Cleveland!
