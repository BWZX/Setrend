RaniaKhalek	720800302811717632	2016-04-15T02:25:58	Again, BernieSanders is one of the only national leaders in our country willing to say Israel is disproportionately violent to Palestine.

RaniaKhalek	720800257215504385	2016-04-15T02:25:47	"You evaded the question," says Sanders. The debate is "was their response disproportionate? You did not answer it." DemDebate

RaniaKhalek	720788266274930688	2016-04-15T01:38:08	Hillary Clinton is full of lies. She cozies up to NRA lobbyist 
RaniaKhalek	720754511850115072	2016-04-14T23:24:01	This is rightwing Jews attacking a left-wing Jew so hard they're calling for her to be fired all bc she dissented against Netanyahu.

RaniaKhalek	720406097337651200	2016-04-14T00:19:32	RiosJose559 IsawInfo38 djkilllist and that should be criticized harshly. But he's more amenable than anyone else. That's important.
RaniaKhalek	720405078117584900	2016-04-14T00:15:29	IsawInfo38 djkilllist HRC supports coups and death squads. Sanders doesn't. He offers more than just lesser evil.
RaniaKhalek	720404420370898946	2016-04-14T00:12:52	djkilllist I think he would be. Getting money out of politics is the greatest obstacle to changing foreign policy. He wants to do that
RaniaKhalek	720403724200312832	2016-04-14T00:10:06	RiosJose559 and that's a bad thing? Cornel West is whispering in Sanders' ear. Boeing and Wall Street are whispering in Hillary's.
RaniaKhalek	720403174989918209	2016-04-14T00:07:56	djkilllist So wouldn't it be helpful to have a president who listens to the left &amp; opposes the war industry?
RaniaKhalek	720401000348004352	2016-04-13T23:59:17	I don't understand the anti-imperialists turning their noses up at the widespread anti-war sensibilities of Bernie Sanders supporters...

RaniaKhalek	720399817986412544	2016-04-13T23:54:35	djkilllist what are you basing that on? He's far less likely to go to war than any other candidates
