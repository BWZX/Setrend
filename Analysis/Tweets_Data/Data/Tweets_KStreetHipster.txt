KStreetHipster	726249934983286784	2016-04-30T03:20:52	If they don't want to consider it part of their religion, why keep the prejudice right there in the book they call holy?
KStreetHipster	726249736240435200	2016-04-30T03:20:04	You don't even have to look hard to find it right there in the religion's own holy words. How is this even still being debated.
KStreetHipster	726249470359293954	2016-04-30T03:19:01	jefftrucks how does it cover if they aren't joining it? Also, why is the prejudice embedded in the scripture if it's not in the religion?
KStreetHipster	726249195573637120	2016-04-30T03:17:55	bcthegeek I don't really know which ones they use often üò¨
KStreetHipster	726248822435811328	2016-04-30T03:16:26	1 Corinthians 6:9-10 Leviticus 18:22 Qu'ran 7:80-84  There's your three western faiths. Of course the prejudice is religiously based.
KStreetHipster	726247501662031872	2016-04-30T03:11:12	If anti-gay prejudice isn't taught in religion, then why does scripture shame homosexuality in multiple instances? 
KStreetHipster	726246883807490048	2016-04-30T03:08:44	DAChesney well I think many religions teach a lot of prejudice. And not just gay bashing.
KStreetHipster	726246297854865409	2016-04-30T03:06:25	DAChesney if it were cultural and not religious then why do people who are religious oppose homosexuality more than those who are secular?
KStreetHipster	726245985412780033	2016-04-30T03:05:10	DAChesney in a place like here in CT you can choose from like 60 different religions. All with local churches. Doubt they all agree on gays

KStreetHipster	726245404115783682	2016-04-30T03:02:51	DAChesney why do people affiliate with specific faiths if the church views are meaningless to them?
KStreetHipster	726244206566461440	2016-04-30T02:58:06	DAChesney so u don't think Jehovahs witnesses have actually different church teachings on homosexuality that affect their views?
KStreetHipster	726244020360368129	2016-04-30T02:57:22	DAChesney it's not harsh compared to other churches! It even says it's a forgivable sin. Mormons wouldn't even let u in a temple.
KStreetHipster	726243466531872768	2016-04-30T02:55:10	DAChesney so that affects the dogma taught, no?
KStreetHipster	726243328065298432	2016-04-30T02:54:37	DAChesney instead the stratification in viewpoint seems to obviously be taught by the churches. Which is why they all differ so much.
KStreetHipster	726243184594968577	2016-04-30T02:54:02	DAChesney I'm saying people don't join a church to provide cover for their prejudices. That's not how people operate.
KStreetHipster	726243048380731392	2016-04-30T02:53:30	DAChesney I thought I framed it as acceptance not as empowerment
KStreetHipster	726242683446943744	2016-04-30T02:52:03	DAChesney but not in every religion. Only if it's taught in the religion.
KStreetHipster	726242563762446336	2016-04-30T02:51:34	DAChesney not even episcopalian???
KStreetHipster	726242482648813568	2016-04-30T02:51:15	DAChesney it's like night and day.
KStreetHipster	726242467490603008	2016-04-30T02:51:11	DAChesney here was the chart I was looking for. Compare Baptist to Church of Christ for example. 
KStreetHipster	726242030779662337	2016-04-30T02:49:27	DAChesney REALLY? Here is the data from the Pew poll on this. I'll find a better breakdown. 
KStreetHipster	726241827708231680	2016-04-30T02:48:39	DAChesney Jewish
KStreetHipster	726240581974810624	2016-04-30T02:43:42	DAChesney I think you're missing my point. I'm not sure how best to rephrase. Why is there divergence among the various faiths?
KStreetHipster	726240166361239553	2016-04-30T02:42:03	DAChesney no I mean snapshot this current moment right now. Some religions are 80% supportive of gay rights. Some only 25%.
KStreetHipster	726239964887814145	2016-04-30T02:41:15	DAChesney but all the current religions exist in the same time. And some are way more anti-gay than others. U really think it's not dogma?
KStreetHipster	726239272609550336	2016-04-30T02:38:30	DAChesney then why do different religions have such divergent views on homosexuality if religion isn't a motivating factor for the views?
KStreetHipster	726235818386300928	2016-04-30T02:24:46	I'm sorry I just don't buy that people intentionally go and join a religion just to provide fake cover for their gay-hating.
KStreetHipster	726235537627971584	2016-04-30T02:23:39	Then why do different religions have such divergent views on homosexuality?

KStreetHipster	725556087793938432	2016-04-28T05:23:46	scrubfish11 it depends on level of intoxication subjectively. And depends on continuing consent that can exist in the relationship.

KStreetHipster	725554717225426944	2016-04-28T05:18:19	scrubfish11 it should be an evidentiary matter. "Was there consent" should be a jury question.
KStreetHipster	725554538963308546	2016-04-28T05:17:36	scrubfish11 it depends on whether there is consent. It can be determined by looking a course and history, relationship understandings.

KStreetHipster	725545747362369537	2016-04-28T04:42:40	scrubfish11 all you lawyers need to grow a soul. There are more important things that semantics. Intent matters way more. Laws have meaning
KStreetHipster	725545604663799810	2016-04-28T04:42:06	scrubfish11 why would the legislature do that on purpose? The court is forced to pretend this wasn't a mistake?
KStreetHipster	725545411637702656	2016-04-28T04:41:20	scrubfish11 all they had to do was look at the facts of the case to see literally anything you do to an unconscious person is force.
KStreetHipster	725545181605322752	2016-04-28T04:40:25	BusterBroncoEsq so does this court actually think the OK legislature wanted this? It seems insane to me.
KStreetHipster	725544981952221184	2016-04-28T04:39:38	scrubfish11 in my view force includes nonconsent. I don't think that's a stretch at all.
KStreetHipster	725544851551322112	2016-04-28T04:39:07	scrubfish11 why is one interpretable and the other one not?
KStreetHipster	725544037046882304	2016-04-28T04:35:53	scrubfish11 in order to not consider them to be arms isn't that looking at something more than text?
KStreetHipster	725543795102642176	2016-04-28T04:34:55	BusterBroncoEsq but you said you agree with the ruling.
KStreetHipster	725543590873559040	2016-04-28T04:34:06	scrubfish11 all those are arms though right ?
KStreetHipster	725543485831413760	2016-04-28T04:33:41	BusterBroncoEsq I have a question. When a court reads the constitution are they limited to only text or can they look at intent instead?
KStreetHipster	725543220331991040	2016-04-28T04:32:38	scrubfish11 do you admit we sometimes look to intent in order to obtain a fair interpretation of a legal word or law?
KStreetHipster	725543036093009921	2016-04-28T04:31:54	scrubfish11 text alone would mean all weapons or even arms, no?
KStreetHipster	725542949199605760	2016-04-28T04:31:33	scrubfish11 don't we interpret "arms" in the second amendment to mean something more than the text? We use intent, no?
KStreetHipster	725542181151219712	2016-04-28T04:28:30	BusterBroncoEsq and the court could have gone with the intent instead of the obviously flawed text to provide Justice.  They failed.
KStreetHipster	725542001299476480	2016-04-28T04:27:47	I'll never understand conservatives fetish for textual semantics as a preference over fairness and justice and the spirit of the law.
KStreetHipster	725541688328888320	2016-04-28T04:26:33	BusterBroncoEsq do you always prefer textual semantics to fairness?
KStreetHipster	725541595869667329	2016-04-28T04:26:11	scrubfish11 why not read the law in a more sensible way that provides Justice? Why actually prefer textual semantics to fairness?
KStreetHipster	725541336972038144	2016-04-28T04:25:09	BusterBroncoEsq this is fucking stupid.
KStreetHipster	725541199843495936	2016-04-28T04:24:36	BusterBroncoEsq why would the lawmakers want to allow mouth rape? What's the justification?
KStreetHipster	725541097288536065	2016-04-28T04:24:12	BusterBroncoEsq or maybe they fixed one and forgot to fix the other one?
KStreetHipster	725541012894932992	2016-04-28T04:23:52	BusterBroncoEsq the law should be interpreted in a way that matches the most likely intent. That's Justice. Fixating on words is not.
KStreetHipster	725540817398452224	2016-04-28T04:23:05	BusterBroncoEsq then why assume the legislature meant to still allow it with a mouth? That doesn't even make sense.
KStreetHipster	725540428922023938	2016-04-28T04:21:32	BusterBroncoEsq even if the legislature probably didn't mean to allow unconscious oral penetration of kids faces?
KStreetHipster	725539943699750912	2016-04-28T04:19:37	BusterBroncoEsq so why not read it in such a way that fixes the obvious problem?
KStreetHipster	725539836757602304	2016-04-28T04:19:11	scrubfish11 do you really think force doesn't include lack of consent?
KStreetHipster	725539662589120512	2016-04-28T04:18:30	BusterBroncoEsq ok but there still is actual force. Lack of consent is force.
KStreetHipster	725539159452975105	2016-04-28T04:16:30	BusterBroncoEsq what?
KStreetHipster	725539045334376449	2016-04-28T04:16:02	BusterBroncoEsq aren't gaps in statutes filled with common law all the time? Isn't that why opinions are relied on as precedent?
KStreetHipster	725538705650282496	2016-04-28T04:14:41	I am stunned &amp; feeling a bit sick after reading this 
KStreetHipster	725538170637410304	2016-04-28T04:12:34	BusterBroncoEsq all they had to do was read the law in such a way that acknowledged that one form of force is lack of consent. That's easy.
KStreetHipster	725537031548489728	2016-04-28T04:08:02	Oklahoma court is ok with unconscious girls being forcibly sodomized.

KStreetHipster	725536667235311616	2016-04-28T04:06:35	JayCaruso do you think the legislature intended to create an unconsciousness loophole for nonconsentual oral penetration?
KStreetHipster	725536348535316480	2016-04-28T04:05:19	BusterBroncoEsq so?

KStreetHipster	725536129206738945	2016-04-28T04:04:27	You err on the side of the intent of the law, not the fucking text. Seek to understand and not just READ.
KStreetHipster	725535960352481280	2016-04-28T04:03:47	Like hmm, do we interpret "force" to include lack of consent and protect people, or do we care more about these  obviously mistaken words.
KStreetHipster	725535692571340800	2016-04-28T04:02:43	This is what textualism does. It forces judges to ignore the whole point of the law in favor of ill considered words. Pure pedantry.

KStreetHipster	725534132856451072	2016-04-28T03:57:58	JayCaruso yes I read the article. It's pedantic. Even their rape law has this fixed. That's not persuasive authority?
KStreetHipster	725533885711290370	2016-04-28T03:56:31	JayCaruso laws are intended to help us enforce morals. What good are they if we go so strict textualist we lose the spirit of the intent???
KStreetHipster	725533451793788929	2016-04-28T03:55:32	JayCaruso force means more than its definition in the law itself. All they had to do was use a dictionary. Lack of consent is force.
KStreetHipster	725533248642646019	2016-04-28T03:53:49	JayCaruso it's not like she chose it. It was made to happen to her. That's force in my view.
KStreetHipster	725533092773957633	2016-04-28T03:53:00	JayCaruso the law makes forcible penetration of the mouth illegal. Surely taking advantage of an unconscious girl  is force, right?
KStreetHipster	725532780038221824	2016-04-28T03:52:23	JayCaruso so you actually think there's no force involved when having sex with an unconscious person's mouth?

KStreetHipster	725531166996983809	2016-04-28T03:48:28	JayCaruso don't they have law reviews? Does nobody read them once they're passed?

KStreetHipster	725390076134322177	2016-04-27T18:24:05	thomj9 this seems like a very odd concern to me. Handle it with prosecutorial ethical rules instead of statutes of limitation. IMO.
KStreetHipster	725389514500243456	2016-04-27T18:21:51	thomj9 so... Couldn't they just threaten a person when they didn't have a past crime?
KStreetHipster	725389391607132160	2016-04-27T18:21:22	SCOTUSPlaces theglipper I guess I was thinking it was about evidence reliability instead of forgiveness. I'm all for forgiveness.

KStreetHipster	725389062933073920	2016-04-27T18:20:04	thomj9 but if prosecuted within the window you'd have to hire an attorney then too. What's the difference?

KStreetHipster	725388278304636933	2016-04-27T18:16:57	thomj9 but the charges have to be proven right? Like you still need proof beyond reasonable doubt... Don't u?
KStreetHipster	725387998901071873	2016-04-27T18:15:50	theglipper I guess I just notice it being applied to things more important than theft. Even felonies.
KStreetHipster	725387807494037504	2016-04-27T18:15:05	jefffreyspies ok but why admit evidence that's considered so unreliable it wouldn't even be permitted in other cases?

KStreetHipster	725386669956812802	2016-04-27T18:10:33	theglipper aren't concerns about finality outweighed by the need for justice? You still have to prove beyond a doubt. W/o double jeopardy.
KStreetHipster	725386245874937857	2016-04-27T18:08:52	thomj9 is proof beyond a reasonable doubt still required? How is that petty?
KStreetHipster	725386130481278976	2016-04-27T18:08:25	thomj9 it's inconsistent
KStreetHipster	725385936855425025	2016-04-27T18:07:39	But if the case is about murder, we are like, lol what worries ???
KStreetHipster	725385774275792896	2016-04-27T18:07:00	So in sum, we are SO WORRIED about evidence being out of date in the lesser crimes that we forbid persecution altogether....
KStreetHipster	725385569031712768	2016-04-27T18:06:11	Because there is no statute of limitation for homicide but there is for many lesser crimes. Inexplicably.
KStreetHipster	725385417713831936	2016-04-27T18:05:35	And despite the fact that for higher stakes cases, even capital punishment cases, we just ignore all those evidentiary concerns and allow it
KStreetHipster	725385211496669184	2016-04-27T18:04:46	Despite the fact that the burden of proof is not on the defendant, but on the prosecution. To porous guilt beyond reasonable doubt. üôÉ
KStreetHipster	725385021863809024	2016-04-27T18:04:00	And to ensure facts in the case are not so distant in time from the judicial process that the defendant is disadvantaged to defend himself.
KStreetHipster	725384735652900864	2016-04-27T18:02:52	So, here's what I learned about statutes of limitation today. The rationale behind them is abt evidence becoming less available over time.
KStreetHipster	725383979273052160	2016-04-27T17:59:52	Like, if your party is based on defense of free markets, maybe try to pick a running mate who is known for being *good* at business.

KStreetHipster	725382680829779968	2016-04-27T17:54:42	JasonVendel I find it to be entirely contradictory.
KStreetHipster	725382529243455488	2016-04-27T17:54:06	JasonVendel sounds like it should be the opposite. The stakes are so much higher in a capital case... Yet that's where we DONT limit lol
KStreetHipster	725382348280221696	2016-04-27T17:53:23	JasonVendel So we permit old evidence in a case with higher penalty (even death) but consider its consideration unfair in a lesser crime.
KStreetHipster	725381770389004288	2016-04-27T17:51:05	TheLocalCrank then why allow conviction based on evidence we literally wouldn't even allow for lesser crimes?
KStreetHipster	725381568538112000	2016-04-27T17:50:17	JasonVendel I know but it seems to me only the prosecutor should have to prove things.
KStreetHipster	725381364611047425	2016-04-27T17:49:28	JasonVendel it just seems odd. Idk. I'm not a lawyer.
KStreetHipster	725381288790626304	2016-04-27T17:49:10	JasonVendel ok but some crimes have no statute right? So isn't an ability to prove defense beyond a doubt also hard in the non-SoL crimes?
KStreetHipster	725381018182545409	2016-04-27T17:48:06	TheLocalCrank do they (defense) have better ability to show an old alibi in a murder case than a rape case? What's the difference?
KStreetHipster	725380613222486018	2016-04-27T17:46:29	JasonVendel how does one go about proving a negative? How does one produce proof of not molesting?
KStreetHipster	725380363195830272	2016-04-27T17:45:30	JasonVendel I swear I will never understand courts. This seems so backwards to me.
KStreetHipster	725380240487280640	2016-04-27T17:45:00	JasonVendel can't hey just demonstrate the prosecution hasn't met the reasonable doubt threshold...  By showing its weak
KStreetHipster	725380014657560576	2016-04-27T17:44:07	JasonVendel I... Not sure I follow. The evidence is submitted by the prosecutor, right?
KStreetHipster	725379767357169664	2016-04-27T17:43:08	JasonVendel I'm sorry I just didn't know the defense had to produce evidence to prove innocence. Got it backwards I think.
KStreetHipster	725379468513054720	2016-04-27T17:41:56	spherulitic to provide fair Justice to the victims.
KStreetHipster	725379256348364800	2016-04-27T17:41:06	TheLocalCrank I thought the defense didn't have any burden of proof? Isn't that on prosecution only?
KStreetHipster	725379089234677760	2016-04-27T17:40:26	JasonVendel I thought the defense just had to show how the prosecution didn't meet the burden? They have to prove things too?
KStreetHipster	725378873123180544	2016-04-27T17:39:34	We regularly mock bad punditry. So this might be a rare opportunity to laud pretty good punditry. mattklewis

KStreetHipster	725378016746967040	2016-04-27T17:36:10	JasonVendel then why not just let juries decide the proof is unpersuasive? They still have to surpass reasonable doubt, right?
KStreetHipster	725374417652441088	2016-04-27T17:21:52	jefffreyspies so why not limit it to cases where the only evidence is human testimony?

KStreetHipster	725373355063271424	2016-04-27T17:17:39	I find it very odd that something can go from serious felony to not even prosecutable based on it being a few calendar days later...
KStreetHipster	725373110719913984	2016-04-27T17:16:41	What is the purpose of a statute of limitations on child molestation and sexual assault?
KStreetHipster	725372903424819200	2016-04-27T17:15:51	CommsDirector I fully blame the legislature: that's a dumb law.
KStreetHipster	725372687191674881	2016-04-27T17:15:00	CommsDirector isn't that even worse? First you molest, then you try to keep it secret forever...
KStreetHipster	725372079353245696	2016-04-27T17:12:35	KStreetHipster it wasn't for the molestation, it was for the hush money stuff. The statute of limitations passed on the molestation.
KStreetHipster	725372496120176641	2016-04-27T17:14:14	fbihop hmm. Seems odd to have a limit on that.

KStreetHipster	725343965143175168	2016-04-27T15:20:52	It's not likely. But I want to say this 4:00pm announcement is a unity ticket. Cruz-Kasich.
KStreetHipster	725343003460526081	2016-04-27T15:17:02	5. It would be smart for both Cruz and Kasich to choose to do this. Helps both of them. In my view. It would be bold.
KStreetHipster	725342831431147521	2016-04-27T15:16:21	4. And they can set a new and invigorated narrative for the remaining states including Indiana. And bring aboard Cruz skeptics.
KStreetHipster	725342591932231681	2016-04-27T15:15:24	3. If Cruz/Kasich announce a ticket together, they can persuade delegates that the cumulative total outweighing Trump makes election legit.
KStreetHipster	725342276038225920	2016-04-27T15:14:09	2. This doesn't mean anything under convention rules. But if nobody reaches the magic number for 1st ballot, it's persuasive for 2nd ballot.
KStreetHipster	725341953571704832	2016-04-27T15:12:52	1. Theory: Between the two of them, Cruz and Kasich  can achieve a cumulative total of delegates that exceed Trump's number.

KStreetHipster	724685193211060224	2016-04-25T19:43:08	DAChesney ok but the law should always be followed. Especially by schools which are government agencies. It shouldn't be a choice.
KStreetHipster	724685053683363840	2016-04-25T19:42:35	They call themselves constitutionalists. And yet the deny its very words. Damn straight I'm sick of it.

KStreetHipster	724684125362229248	2016-04-25T19:38:54	DAChesney it should not be optional to follow the establishment clause.
KStreetHipster	724684061390725125	2016-04-25T19:38:38	DAChesney no I'm not persecuting. I'm asking that the law be followed. A law that protects us from religious favoritism by government.
KStreetHipster	724683896789471233	2016-04-25T19:37:59	DAChesney or like, ask politely that they not do this to kids?
KStreetHipster	724683608850464769	2016-04-25T19:36:50	DAChesney ok. So... I'm having trouble understanding your view on this. Don't sue and let it continue?
KStreetHipster	724683415446941696	2016-04-25T19:36:04	TheRunUp2016 ok where do I give the credit here? The ones who think snakes can speak Hebrew? Tell me please.
KStreetHipster	724683208667746304	2016-04-25T19:35:15	It's not just some freaking coincidence. It's a correlation.
KStreetHipster	724683106574180352	2016-04-25T19:34:51	why does it seem that every back-asswards, bigoted, scientifically illiterate, self-righteous thing in the news is spurred by scripture
KStreetHipster	724682677387812866	2016-04-25T19:33:08	TheRunUp2016 not misinformation. Not to kids. That's the opposite of education.
KStreetHipster	724682532529180672	2016-04-25T19:32:34	DAChesney do you think it's cool to let public schools teach that humans rode dinosaurs and that Noah's ark is real?
KStreetHipster	724682355374350336	2016-04-25T19:31:52	DAChesney marketplace of ideas is for college. Primary school should teach facts. Not mythology.
KStreetHipster	724681267648688129	2016-04-25T19:27:32	DAChesney "does it make some feel like an insider and others as an outsider?"   You can't play favorites with religions. It's illegal.
KStreetHipster	724681100161736704	2016-04-25T19:26:52	DAChesney not just a political point! People should be protected from indoctrination. It's Justice oconnor's formula for 1st amendment:
KStreetHipster	724680767616389120	2016-04-25T19:25:33	This is an actual frame in the museum. Where public school kids are bussed to at taxpayer expense: 
KStreetHipster	724680582957953029	2016-04-25T19:24:49	DAChesney the law is applied with force. Courts don't ask. They demand.
KStreetHipster	724680472161177600	2016-04-25T19:24:23	I don't know if I'm more sad or angry. Maybe just disappointed. These people are supposed to be professional educators.
KStreetHipster	724680202593292288	2016-04-25T19:23:18	DAChesney im saying these ones are indoctrinating kids.
KStreetHipster	724679985642921984	2016-04-25T19:22:27	Don't ppl realize that if Adam and Eve started humanity their kids would have to fuck each other to get to the third generation?

KStreetHipster	724679582620618754	2016-04-25T19:20:51	Noah's Ark was not real. Adam and Eve are fake. Dinosaurs were not ridden by humans. Snakes can't speak. Natural selection is real.
KStreetHipster	724679318589181953	2016-04-25T19:19:48	Kids should learn from scientists, not preachers. Is that TOO MUCH TO ASK
KStreetHipster	724679095859081216	2016-04-25T19:18:54	ajgenz that seems like an abuse of power.
KStreetHipster	724678988849774592	2016-04-25T19:18:29	We have basically just learned to embrace ignorance. To praise narrow mindedness. To ignore actual law in a whole state.
KStreetHipster	724678572712058880	2016-04-25T19:16:50	KStreetHipster it also has saddles on dinosaurs
KStreetHipster	724678658619633664	2016-04-25T19:17:10	ajgenz I think they should follow the law without having to be sued. It shouldn't need to be demanded.
KStreetHipster	724678356424220672	2016-04-25T19:15:58	This "museum" says Adam and Eve were real people.
KStreetHipster	724678215294291968	2016-04-25T19:15:25	ihatedeadends OH FUCK OFF
KStreetHipster	724678161888235520	2016-04-25T19:15:12	They should read the first amendment. 
KStreetHipster	724678050672078848	2016-04-25T19:14:45	ajgenz aren't the parents allowed?
KStreetHipster	724677967662608385	2016-04-25T19:14:26	Tallis_VA and that makes this ok huh
KStreetHipster	724677899429670912	2016-04-25T19:14:09	The museum literally says dinosaurs and humans coexisted. It says Noah's Ark actually happened.
KStreetHipster	724677420834426884	2016-04-25T19:12:15	nysepete they should probably follow the law. In my view.
KStreetHipster	724677259764752384	2016-04-25T19:11:37	ajgenz but don't they have attorneys?
KStreetHipster	724677141321764864	2016-04-25T19:11:08	I swear we are being swarmed by self righteous pricks everywhere. You don't get to force kids to be your religion.
KStreetHipster	724676838715318273	2016-04-25T19:09:56	And if a lawyer signs off on this, how is it not a form of malpractice? The direct precedent is from 2012. It's plain as day.
KStreetHipster	724676652228206592	2016-04-25T19:09:12	Like aren't there lawyers on school boards? Isn't that pretty freaking common?
KStreetHipster	724676529444155393	2016-04-25T19:08:43	Of all these schools, nobody said hay maybe we should consider the law? Maybe we should not indoctrinate children?
KStreetHipster	724676321008214016	2016-04-25T19:07:53	We will probably just yawn and do nothing about it. As we always seem to. Letting people get away with intentional deception.
KStreetHipster	724675862453313537	2016-04-25T19:06:04	What do they tell the children who speak up and say the museum conflicts with science? Do they ask them to shush? Do they argue the point?
KStreetHipster	724675622664953856	2016-04-25T19:05:06	How can a person be so self righteous they use a public school to indoctrinate kids in their own religion? How much gall does that take?
KStreetHipster	724675342619668482	2016-04-25T19:04:00	Do they teach the first amendment in these schools or do they skip the establishment clause altogether?
KStreetHipster	724674777085042688	2016-04-25T19:01:45	KStreetHipster If the synagogue wanted kids to visit it, it should have offered dinosaur rides. The free market has spoken.
KStreetHipster	724674870890532864	2016-04-25T19:02:07	Why do people not do things about this? They just let it happen
KStreetHipster	724674722865119232	2016-04-25T19:01:32	They're basically subsidizing a specific religion. Like entirely throwing the lemon test out the window.
KStreetHipster	724674388809801729	2016-04-25T19:00:12	The Creation Museum makes $12.95 per student. All paid for by the public.   Fucking insane.
KStreetHipster	724673957782126592	2016-04-25T18:58:29	Here kids let's go un-learn science class!
KStreetHipster	724673840106725377	2016-04-25T18:58:01	I'm *sure* these same schools went to go tour a synagogue and a mosque and a temple also. Right?
KStreetHipster	724673589002129408	2016-04-25T18:57:02	THIS IS CALLED RELIGIOUS FAVORITISM. It's indoctrination. 
KStreetHipster	724672891137064961	2016-04-25T18:54:15	Taxpayers should ask for school administrators to pay this money back.

KStreetHipster	724623616055238656	2016-04-25T15:38:27	To summarize, according to Reuters nat'l polling, Sanders is correct: poor most likely to support him, rich least. 
KStreetHipster	724663927162867712	2016-04-25T18:18:38	Literal chills ran down my spine. It's rare that television does that anymore. Very rare.
KStreetHipster	724663708622819328	2016-04-25T18:17:46	Starting to think last night's Game of Thrones ending was the best episode ending I've seen in years. Genuinely riveting, creepy, surprising
KStreetHipster	724662639289339905	2016-04-25T18:13:31	To every dude who's ever said "oh you're a writer lol don't write about me!!": HOW INTERESTING DO YOU THINK YOU ARE
KStreetHipster	724654284558606337	2016-04-25T17:40:19	In my mentions this morning. 
KStreetHipster	724653950889136128	2016-04-25T17:38:59	root_of_all_eli there's no secret that the biggest science skeptics in the world are also the most religious people. Fundamentalists.
KStreetHipster	724653789219713024	2016-04-25T17:38:21	root_of_all_eli no. I'm saying we can encourage free-thinking and demonstrate the correlation between religion and anti-intellectualism.
KStreetHipster	724653574135767040	2016-04-25T17:37:30	root_of_all_eli well it's being dogmatic to a certain extent. One can be taught faith and ritual without reading the actual bible.
KStreetHipster	724648008948666368	2016-04-25T17:15:23	The one thing we are always losing is time. Since it's gonna disappear anyway, the question is how we spend it.
KStreetHipster	724643726069366788	2016-04-25T16:58:22	DrPizza root_of_all_eli surely it teaches it, otherwise why would there be such stark differences between the faiths?
KStreetHipster	724642172100743168	2016-04-25T16:52:11	root_of_all_eli my point can be summed up easily: if gay-hate is broadly cultural, then why is it WAY magnified among ppl of faith?
KStreetHipster	724641388055289856	2016-04-25T16:49:04	root_of_all_eli when God is on your side it's hard to ever admit the non-God way of doing things is permissible.
KStreetHipster	724641267498422272	2016-04-25T16:48:36	root_of_all_eli it means religion plays a role in nudging ppl toward embracing discrimination and non-inclusive thinking. Dogma, in short.
KStreetHipster	724641057720291328	2016-04-25T16:47:45	root_of_all_eli I imagine very few ppl go to a baptist church and are all like which the trinity is not for me, imma be Pentacostal now!
KStreetHipster	724640609978318848	2016-04-25T16:45:59	root_of_all_eli but once they join, the dogma definitely changes their personal views on things. 2/2
KStreetHipster	724640468412162049	2016-04-25T16:45:25	root_of_all_eli in my experience people usually join religions based on family &amp; geography more than the ideas in the dogma. 1/2
KStreetHipster	724639900142694401	2016-04-25T16:43:10	root_of_all_eli but 83% of episcopalian are down with it. The religion seems to make a huge difference, no?
KStreetHipster	724639763550998529	2016-04-25T16:42:37	root_of_all_eli why not just admit it's religion? I can show u the differences. 30% of Baptists are ok with accepting gays in society.
KStreetHipster	724639441868877830	2016-04-25T16:41:20	root_of_all_eli but ultimately (I'm looking at a Pew Poll from 2015) 83% of "unaffiliated" support gay acceptance &amp; only 54% of Christians.
KStreetHipster	724639048631877632	2016-04-25T16:39:46	root_of_all_eli because not all religious people are the same. Some are more dogmatic, some more open to change. It's baptist vs. episcopal
KStreetHipster	724638802564673542	2016-04-25T16:38:48	root_of_all_eli I suppose they think they're carrying out god's will? He did lightning Sodom &amp; Gomorrah after all.
KStreetHipster	724636609623158784	2016-04-25T16:30:05	root_of_all_eli I disagree. The opposition to LGBT equality is also pronounced in religious minority groups. It's why CA passed prop 8.
KStreetHipster	724634631232872448	2016-04-25T16:22:13	root_of_all_eli I think most of them put their religion before the county. Not the other way around.
KStreetHipster	724634431110008832	2016-04-25T16:21:26	root_of_all_eli so ... Do you think they are pretending? In my experience church attendance has little to do with how religious a person is
KStreetHipster	724634150980866048	2016-04-25T16:20:19	agree. 
KStreetHipster	724632534567510017	2016-04-25T16:13:53	Has anyone identified a single voter who was planning to vote for Cruz/Kasich but will now switch their vote because of "the deal"?
KStreetHipster	724631485202878464	2016-04-25T16:09:43	Morning vs. Night 
KStreetHipster	724629338541314050	2016-04-25T16:01:11	root_of_all_eli I don't think knowing the bible is what makes a person religious. I think acting dogmatically does.
KStreetHipster	724629188087402496	2016-04-25T16:00:36	root_of_all_eli but it doesn't seem to be "cultural" among those who aren't religious. It's pronounced among the devout.
KStreetHipster	724628348048015361	2016-04-25T15:57:15	root_of_all_eli I don't think it's a central tenant. But it's definitely a part of all the conservative versions of the faith.
KStreetHipster	724626748059447296	2016-04-25T15:50:54	This, by alittlelilypad is required reading. I love seeing my Twitter friends get published!

KStreetHipster	724601872997212160	2016-04-25T14:12:03	Not to mention the $$$ that could be generated through revenue from more employment, higher minimum wages, etc.
KStreetHipster	724601633749893121	2016-04-25T14:11:06	The death penalty is pricy. So are settlements to wrongfully killed suspects. Plus unnecessary war is pretty expensive.
KStreetHipster	724600980700962817	2016-04-25T14:08:30	So many progressive things can be defended under the conservative banner of saving public money.

KStreetHipster	724575534714232832	2016-04-25T12:27:24	Read this story by my friend imillhiser. Just when u thought u couldn't be shocked anymore by the Justice system... 
KStreetHipster	724573271396507648	2016-04-25T12:18:24	Ain't that the damn truth. 
KStreetHipster	724572528870486016	2016-04-25T12:15:27	I like reading good news 
KStreetHipster	724516176991281152	2016-04-25T08:31:32	Fuck whoever thought this ad was a good idea. ‚Äúwhat if, right, a giant banker was taking a literal shit on the city‚Äù 
KStreetHipster	724461668680364032	2016-04-25T04:54:56	OMG DREAM SCENARIO: Cruz wins Indiana, and then backs out of the deal and competes against Kasich in Oregon and New Mexico. HeCould!
KStreetHipster	724459727921401856	2016-04-25T04:47:13	inkedtater Jesus. I would not want names attached to ballots ever. Reeks of the old machine politics days without anon voting
KStreetHipster	724458746915606528	2016-04-25T04:43:19	inkedtater how do they know which ballot was theirs? Do they put names on them? I thought it was anon?
KStreetHipster	724458532725116929	2016-04-25T04:42:28	DrPizza trump is winning fair and square
KStreetHipster	724458460998291456	2016-04-25T04:42:11	Ranked ballots would make more sense. But instead they're throwing in the towel in entire states.
KStreetHipster	724458176003731456	2016-04-25T04:41:03	inkedtater is that illegal?
KStreetHipster	724458075646623744	2016-04-25T04:40:39	This all just runs antithetical to the way elections are supposed to work. Your supposed to vote for the one you support. Not others.
KStreetHipster	724457814555422720	2016-04-25T04:39:37	So why *ever* early vote in a primary if this is something that we do now? What if at the last minute you have to vote for other people?
KStreetHipster	724457563144646656	2016-04-25T04:38:37	Like, they tried to do the right thing. They early voted. But now Kasich wants them to support Cruz. And they can't change the ballot now.
KStreetHipster	724457327949041669	2016-04-25T04:37:41	Everyone who did the responsible thing and early voted for Kasich in Indiana, is now gonna feel pretty bad about not helping Cruz.
KStreetHipster	724457011350364161	2016-04-25T04:36:25	PAONCO in my view you shouldn't be expected to just drop everything to help the other person win. It's not supposed to work like this.
KStreetHipster	724456801157021696	2016-04-25T04:35:35	PAONCO I just don't like jerking voters around like this. It seems craven.
KStreetHipster	724456675055292416	2016-04-25T04:35:05	PAONCO but now they can't go back and fix their votes, punished for voting early. Basically.
KStreetHipster	724456260775481344	2016-04-25T04:33:26	PAONCO lots of people have already voted in Indiana before tonight. It's record early voting numbers. And now all for the wrong guys.
KStreetHipster	724456038347378689	2016-04-25T04:32:33	PAONCO you don't think the ones who responsibly already voted early for their candidate will feel they helped them lose now?
KStreetHipster	724455464486850560	2016-04-25T04:30:17	tehpwbh isn't he winning fair and square? No collusion on his part, right?
KStreetHipster	724455214472933376	2016-04-25T04:29:17	It's gotta be a gut punch to have to do that. To have worked weeks only to have your won candidate ask you to vote for other people.
KStreetHipster	724454861614391296	2016-04-25T04:27:53	Kasich and Cruz supporters are now obliged to go anti-campaign? Scratch stickers off their own bumpers, post signs for the other candidate?
KStreetHipster	724454367319851008	2016-04-25T04:25:55	PatrickRuffini sure but it's gotta be a gut punch
KStreetHipster	724454184917946370	2016-04-25T04:25:12	Now you gotta go to your lawn and take down the Vote for Cruz sign you bought, so someone else can be allowed to win.
KStreetHipster	724453837000441856	2016-04-25T04:23:49	Or worse: what if you were a Cruz donor in Oregon. You got the shirt, bumper sticker, you donated $200 to the campaign.
KStreetHipster	724453149306589184	2016-04-25T04:21:05	What would it feel like to have phone-banked for days on end. Begging people to vote for your guy, only to have it all tossed away.
KStreetHipster	724452947422109696	2016-04-25T04:20:17	Imagine being a Kasich volunteer in Indiana, knuckles sore from canvassing, then hearing tonight's news. Early voting was already underway.
KStreetHipster	724451947760128001	2016-04-25T04:16:18	
KStreetHipster	724446045439041536	2016-04-25T03:52:51	tehpwbh but he is the one most of them want
KStreetHipster	724445676747120640	2016-04-25T03:51:23	It taints the convention. Empowers the argument that "you wouldn't have won but for collusion." Makes it even more of a mess.
KStreetHipster	724445152991813633	2016-04-25T03:49:18	And even if it succeeds in denying Trump the *magic number* for a first ballot win: it's an admission Kasich &amp; Cruz can't win on the MERITS.
KStreetHipster	724444877597995008	2016-04-25T03:48:13	And that, in turn, will motivate Trump's base. It plays right into his current narrative of a rigged election. Because it's literal rigging.
KStreetHipster	724444631786618882	2016-04-25T03:47:14	Coordination like this, specifically to deny a third candidate some delegates, is going to be seen by (already cynical) GOP voters as crass.
KStreetHipster	724444428924903424	2016-04-25T03:46:26	What politicians keep failing to understand is: voters see their ballot as sacred to a certain extent. Voting is tied up with identity.
KStreetHipster	724444194618494978	2016-04-25T03:45:30	This campaign collusion will go down as a historic mistake. Asking your own voters to vote for someone else is craven &amp; disrespects voters.
KStreetHipster	724442601567350788	2016-04-25T03:39:10	theglipper I just realized.... What about the companies hired by campaigns... Ad makers, consultants... Hmm.
KStreetHipster	724441053156220928	2016-04-25T03:33:01	3. Also leaves Trump with the high ground. He's the only candidate left truly running to win.

KStreetHipster	724435279738601472	2016-04-25T03:10:04	I think there's one take-away from the Kasich/Cruz alliance. Start buying stock in Paul Ryan.

KStreetHipster	724391028589916161	2016-04-25T00:14:14	davdbenjeman scholarensnared such a good point

KStreetHipster	724387586827919360	2016-04-25T00:00:33	scholarensnared ok then the down payment for a car. Instead of a car. How is that for compromise?
KStreetHipster	724387087667974145	2016-04-24T23:58:34	scholarensnared davdbenjeman right that's literally my point
KStreetHipster	724387008093659136	2016-04-24T23:58:15	scholarensnared problem being they would have to abandon anyone they provide care to. Aging parents... Etc
KStreetHipster	724386914430656512	2016-04-24T23:57:53	scholarensnared ok then. Relocation expenses to places with high quality transit systems? As a compromise?
KStreetHipster	724386144612274176	2016-04-24T23:54:49	scholarensnared I see this as very pragmatic. The car fixes the problem in many cases. No more catch 22
KStreetHipster	724386010520375296	2016-04-24T23:54:18	davdbenjeman scholarensnared   It's gotta be impossible for people in rural areas. Do they have busses in rural areas?
KStreetHipster	724385889191763968	2016-04-24T23:53:49	davdbenjeman scholarensnared   Exactly. 7am bus to daycare. Wait 30 min 8:30 bus to work, get to work at 9 unless more to walk
KStreetHipster	724384771715911682	2016-04-24T23:49:22	scholarensnared it would help actually struggling human beings
KStreetHipster	724384680741470208	2016-04-24T23:49:00	scholarensnared that's not always possible when you're raising kids or have other obligations.
KStreetHipster	724382935701311488	2016-04-24T23:42:04	scholarensnared what's wrong with a buearucracy that helps toward full employment? It's one of the reasons we have a government!
KStreetHipster	724382665281916928	2016-04-24T23:41:00	scholarensnared except this would help raise revenue. People with jobs pay taxes. So where is the problem?
KStreetHipster	723965231823622145	2016-04-23T20:02:16	This guy on the plane has the most amazing spreadsheet. 
KStreetHipster	724382109364686848	2016-04-24T23:38:47	scholarensnared the charities here provide food. I do not know a local car assistance program.
KStreetHipster	724381974291304448	2016-04-24T23:38:15	scholarensnared what about helping people get cars is bureaucracy?
KStreetHipster	724381870301962242	2016-04-24T23:37:50	scholarensnared ok and what I'm says is some people can't get jobs because of their lack of a car. That's the barrier from employment.
KStreetHipster	724381719663534080	2016-04-24T23:37:14	scholarensnared what about furniture?
KStreetHipster	724381589652664320	2016-04-24T23:36:43	scholarensnared but assistance programs don't help with access to automobiles.
KStreetHipster	724380301158285314	2016-04-24T23:31:36	scholarensnared I'm talking about the catch 22. When you don't have the money.
KStreetHipster	724380220178862081	2016-04-24T23:31:17	scholarensnared how can someone afford relocation expenses without a job? ???

KStreetHipster	724378918485028865	2016-04-24T23:26:07	scholarensnared davdbenjeman how can you do that if the job is inaccessible? How do you "work" out?
KStreetHipster	724378755817312256	2016-04-24T23:25:28	scholarensnared I'm ok with saying a thing that I see with my own eyes. There's nothing wrong with pointing it out.
KStreetHipster	724378542272696320	2016-04-24T23:24:37	JoelDScout not much no
KStreetHipster	724378489499963392	2016-04-24T23:24:24	scholarensnared PatrickRoyNEB ok and that's exactly what I'm talking about. The catch 22 or impasse whatever u want to call it.
KStreetHipster	724378249892007940	2016-04-24T23:23:27	scholarensnared why? Are you trying to say I'm making this up?

KStreetHipster	724377553251627010	2016-04-24T23:20:41	scholarensnared davdbenjeman is this workable on a morning where u gotta bring a kid to daycare first and then go to work?
KStreetHipster	724376762319171585	2016-04-24T23:17:33	scholarensnared not really, not in suburbia. Not to the level needed.
KStreetHipster	724376628843814912	2016-04-24T23:17:01	scholarensnared obviously not enough
KStreetHipster	724375537842532352	2016-04-24T23:12:41	JoelDScout KStreetHipster a LOT of places won't hire you if they find out you don't have a car. Places that aren't huge cities.
KStreetHipster	724376414879776768	2016-04-24T23:16:10	But those tools are always just barely out of reach without some help.
KStreetHipster	724376312761044992	2016-04-24T23:15:45	And then they wouldn't need either charity or government programs. They could deploy those tools to make their own way.
KStreetHipster	724376131768455168	2016-04-24T23:15:02	We could fix so many long term costs with short term Investments that makes people's lives better. A car. A leg. A house.
KStreetHipster	724375926188859392	2016-04-24T23:14:13	So instead of ANYONE HELPING the fixing the one-time cost of the prosthetic, he just stays unemployed. Another needless strain on charity.
KStreetHipster	724375555479506944	2016-04-24T23:12:45	There's a dude with a stump leg at the knee , all he needs is a prosthetic and he would be way more employable. But nah.
KStreetHipster	724375329070948352	2016-04-24T23:11:51	Other common catch 22's we just let sit there unresolved: no disability treatment means no job.
KStreetHipster	724375031292157952	2016-04-24T23:10:40	But instead of making a gov program to solve the actual problem, we just keep paying for food each week. It's inefficient.
KStreetHipster	724374545658859520	2016-04-24T23:08:44	LOTS of people get stuck in this catch 22: no car means no job, no job means no car. Solving it would help the food bank and the unemployed.

KStreetHipster	724361496394764288	2016-04-24T22:16:53	So this video shows at least half a million dollars just tossed away in a matter of seconds.
KStreetHipster	724361326579970048	2016-04-24T22:16:12	The cost of a single military humvee is about $160,000. And probably a bit more for the modified type that drop from the sky.

KStreetHipster	724342789962506240	2016-04-24T21:02:33	wjmaggos I don't see what that has to do with us.
KStreetHipster	724342633712128000	2016-04-24T21:01:56	wjmaggos I wouldn't see why.
KStreetHipster	724337433718845441	2016-04-24T20:41:16	wjmaggos then I think some targeted tariff implementation is called for. And international restrictions on access to banks and credit.
KStreetHipster	724335833478615040	2016-04-24T20:34:54	wjmaggos not sure what you mean.
KStreetHipster	724334371545575424	2016-04-24T20:29:06	wjmaggos our interest should be peace and prosperity through trade. Democracy helps, but can't be forced or imposed.

KStreetHipster	724330798095028224	2016-04-24T20:14:54	wjmaggos I think there's pretty widespread negative retrospective on the Kissinger era. We face a lot of similar challenges and can learn.
KStreetHipster	724329880217747456	2016-04-24T20:11:15	wjmaggos what do you mean by "secret"?

KStreetHipster	723989706757668864	2016-04-23T21:41:21	SMilkSyndicate Chazperin   My reading of the statute is it only works if both spouses agree to divorce. What if one says no?

KStreetHipster	723974595020087296	2016-04-23T20:39:28	Chazperin I don't see how it would be possible for most people
KStreetHipster	723974535653904384	2016-04-23T20:39:14	Chazperin that probably isn't an option for most people. Especially people with normal incomes. Just let them divorce locally!

KStreetHipster	723971896371367937	2016-04-23T20:28:45	Chazperin that's not what I was talking about. This article is about the Mississippi divorce statutes. Not the other ones
KStreetHipster	723971438928007169	2016-04-23T20:26:56	Chazperin so isn't it still possible for a beaten wife to be forced to remain married?
KStreetHipster	723971231825850368	2016-04-23T20:26:07	Chazperin because the bill to add it did not end up passing
KStreetHipster	723971136581603332	2016-04-23T20:25:44	Chazperin ok but his says they don't have that as one of the grounds, right?
KStreetHipster	723971025650614272	2016-04-23T20:25:17	Chazperin say a wife wants a divorce and husband says no. Can she still get divorced in Mississippi?
KStreetHipster	723970887188238337	2016-04-23T20:24:44	Chazperin ok I'm reading the Mississippi law and it sounds like both spouses have to agree to a no fault divorce. Trapping one right?
KStreetHipster	723970365014208512	2016-04-23T20:22:40	Chazperin then what's the rationale for not permitting spousal abuse to be a reason? But allowing drunkenness to be one?
KStreetHipster	723969853569126400	2016-04-23T20:20:38	Chazperin in all the states? Or just some?

KStreetHipster	723969203812724736	2016-04-23T20:18:03	Chazperin ok what part did I get wrong
KStreetHipster	723964827811479554	2016-04-23T20:00:40	Being forced to remain married against your will, to a violent person. A real thing in America, 2016.

KStreetHipster	723604237528096768	2016-04-22T20:07:48	BTHDerksen it's literally accurate that people refuse to look at the facts that guns make homes less safe. Why can't we just say it
KStreetHipster	723604054459314176	2016-04-22T20:07:05	BTHDerksen I don't understand how bare facts &amp; science and data can be resented. Or how sharing it &amp; wishing it was seen...is seen as bad.

KStreetHipster	723600247562350592	2016-04-22T19:51:57	When Thomas Frank wrote "What's the Matter with Kansas" he illustrated how well meaning people got bamboozled by appeals to sin &amp; grievance.

KStreetHipster	723594328845602816	2016-04-22T19:28:26	hoponmypossum rmehlinger except for the whole part where she actually was hypocritical. Trying to ban marriage despite her own divorces.
KStreetHipster	723594065304948736	2016-04-22T19:27:23	hoponmypossum rmehlinger   I wouldn't call that smug. I'd call that fair politics. I'd call it exposing hard truths.
KStreetHipster	723593936153890816	2016-04-22T19:26:52	hoponmypossum rmehlinger   In my view we have to point to hypocrisy in order to demonstrate the messenger claiming purity is actually not.
KStreetHipster	723593782344609793	2016-04-22T19:26:16	hoponmypossum rmehlinger   The view taken by the article was arrest her and let her have her say. But don't point out her hypocrisy.
KStreetHipster	723593590065111040	2016-04-22T19:25:30	hoponmypossum rmehlinger   Do you think Kim Davis was best handled via legal penalty, or by preventing her attempt to martyr herself?
KStreetHipster	723593159347834880	2016-04-22T19:23:47	Nicholas_Warino I just think we should hold people to higher standards. I don't think insisting on the facts is smug.
KStreetHipster	723592399281217537	2016-04-22T19:20:46	Ian_VdV I guess I just don't see it that way.
KStreetHipster	723592328733052928	2016-04-22T19:20:29	Nicholas_Warino ok well why soften it? Why force our points to be less hard hitting? Why soften a legitimate blow?
KStreetHipster	723591952508178432	2016-04-22T19:18:59	Ian_VdV I think we are remarkably patient. In the gun debate for example look how we always stick to facts while they ramble??!
KStreetHipster	723591742260285440	2016-04-22T19:18:09	Ian_VdV the merits of the data alone should win everyone over. Being frustrated that it DOESN'T is not smugness.
KStreetHipster	723591462122745858	2016-04-22T19:17:02	Nicholas_Warino I don't see any real difference. Sagan accused the religious of living in a "demon haunted world". He was openly satirical.
KStreetHipster	723591147461844997	2016-04-22T19:15:47	Ian_VdV well ok but how do you, for example,ask a person to believe in climate change without showing them how they're wrong using data ...
KStreetHipster	723590928531775488	2016-04-22T19:14:55	Nicholas_Warino author accuses educated liberals of lacking empathy w/o providing proof of it. She sees our reliance on facts as smugness.
KStreetHipster	723590713670164482	2016-04-22T19:14:04	iammattduff didn't beat anybody to a pulp. She became a martyr and celebrity for the anti-gay cause. That's worthy of critique!
KStreetHipster	723590563170119681	2016-04-22T19:13:28	iammattduff well it seems to me preferable to point out the hypocritical weakness of the messenger, especially when the stakes are high.
KStreetHipster	723590391409168384	2016-04-22T19:12:47	Nicholas_Warino I disagree, mostly, with the term "smug" being applied here. It's reason. Not smugness. It's being informed.
KStreetHipster	723590160663736320	2016-04-22T19:11:52	Nicholas_Warino part of it has to be to appeal to human dignity and morality. Part of it is to avoid hiding brutal economic truths.

KStreetHipster	723588990629085186	2016-04-22T19:07:13	iammattduff surely you agree it's ok to point out the hypocrisy of someone trying to make a religious-moral martyr of herself???
KStreetHipster	723588810483732480	2016-04-22T19:06:30	iammattduff sure! It's hypocrisy on the part of her pro-religion message. She wants to wave a bible but not be held to its rules herself.
KStreetHipster	723588591390093312	2016-04-22T19:05:38	rmehlinger hoponmypossum   Not writing off. Demanding a higher standard to hold all of us to. Expecting better from decent people.
KStreetHipster	723588422078595072	2016-04-22T19:04:58	rmehlinger hoponmypossum   In my view we are the ones arguing for reason &amp; sense instead of prejudice &amp; resentment to inform politics.
KStreetHipster	723588156314910720	2016-04-22T19:03:54	rmehlinger hoponmypossum   Well I don't see the left saying climate change is a hoax? How did we contribute to birtherism?
KStreetHipster	723587932422967297	2016-04-22T19:03:01	iammattduff this article is asking us to embrace a factless debate. To tolerate and bear-hug anti-intellectualism.
KStreetHipster	723587677530943488	2016-04-22T19:02:00	iammattduff who am I alienating by pointing out that evolution is real and guns don't make us safer?
KStreetHipster	723587324672503808	2016-04-22T19:00:36	rmehlinger hoponmypossum   I think it's neither of those things. It's to express *legitimate* frustration at people unmoored from reality.
KStreetHipster	723585824579678208	2016-04-22T18:54:38	KStreetHipster been waiting for you to tweet about this article. Are we just supposed to accept that people ignore facts and evidence?
KStreetHipster	723585077104365568	2016-04-22T18:51:40	The article asks for me to respect those who embrace ignorance as a virtue.

KStreetHipster	722084823460806656	2016-04-18T15:30:12	10. Education is the silver bullet. Against health risks, sexual assault, climate change, and a thousand other social ills. Not new laws.
KStreetHipster	722084396736483329	2016-04-18T15:28:30	9. More ppl will reduce sugar intake because of education than they will cuz of laws banning big sodas. It requires books &amp; time. Not laws.

KStreetHipster	722082704435470336	2016-04-18T15:21:47	4. When I wrote my article on citizenship people saw it as "oh she wants mandatory voting". No I dont. I want people to want to participate.
KStreetHipster	722082476638674944	2016-04-18T15:20:52	3. A pattern in my writing is individual responsibility to the community. Not coerced action, but **willing** action to benefit others.
KStreetHipster	722081745542057984	2016-04-18T15:17:58	2. I think the burden of solving problems lands on individual shoulders when you live in a democratic society. "We" are the ones in charge.
KStreetHipster	722081453169770496	2016-04-18T15:16:48	1. Some quick notes about the way I think about complex issues in democratic society:
KStreetHipster	722077976666374146	2016-04-18T15:02:59	The more our fortunes are tied together, the more we will understand and care for each other.

KStreetHipster	722077340268781568	2016-04-18T15:00:28	The existence of cross-border, globalized problems, which necessitate global solutions, requires diplomacy and connectedness.

KStreetHipster	720655233953587200	2016-04-14T16:49:31	It occurs to me that we will learn the VP choices a lot later than normal because of the way the primary process dragged out this year.

KStreetHipster	719329127115788289	2016-04-11T01:00:03	kerl_laura cosmicpossum what about them?
KStreetHipster	719327614905679872	2016-04-11T00:54:02	jamiepastore maybe we could all just stop celebrating wealth in the face of poverty so much.
KStreetHipster	719325549370286080	2016-04-11T00:45:50	jamiepastore maybe we could just bomb them for causing the world to be more deadly.
KStreetHipster	719325065490268162	2016-04-11T00:43:54	jamiepastore seems shun-worthy.

KStreetHipster	719320750440599556	2016-04-11T00:26:45	I'd imagine that KStreetHipster has a comment this evening .... 
KStreetHipster	719318224559407105	2016-04-11T00:16:43	kerl_laura cosmicpossum what does that even mean?? This lady worked 4 jobs and died for it. She didn't get ahead. Fucking tried tho.
KStreetHipster	719316359834800128	2016-04-11T00:09:19	Chazperin OBVIOUSLY not even nearly enough. Not even close.
KStreetHipster	719316253777596416	2016-04-11T00:08:53	dustappeal Chazperin he thinks they should be allowed to keep their wealth while those struggling just keep suffering.
KStreetHipster	719316078866800640	2016-04-11T00:08:12	Chazperin that way the playing field would be leveled and more people would livd happier &amp; longer lives.
KStreetHipster	719315876944617472	2016-04-11T00:07:23	Chazperin taxation of people capable of living lives of luxury to help those who are trying to stay alive.
KStreetHipster	719310731053666305	2016-04-10T23:46:57	Let's be honest: there isn't a crisis in public education when you live in the right zip code. 
KStreetHipster	719314992114184192	2016-04-11T00:03:53	Chazperin the $500 spent on a rooster could have bought health insurance for someone. Which is a better expense? It's not even hard.
KStreetHipster	719314693060296706	2016-04-11T00:02:41	Chazperin to me letting them suffer is unethical. It's a sin. A secular sin. The worst one we can have.
KStreetHipster	719314583903559680	2016-04-11T00:02:15	Chazperin you're damn right I'm not. Letting others suffer should not be permissible. Not while bathing in luxury!
KStreetHipster	719314354961653760	2016-04-11T00:01:21	Some of us can spare our luxuries so that others can be alive. And stay alive. It's worth it. Easily worth it.
KStreetHipster	719314070604632064	2016-04-11T00:00:13	Chazperin some of us can spare our luxuries so that others can be alive. And stay alive. It's worth it. Easily worth it.
KStreetHipster	719313905814638594	2016-04-10T23:59:34	Chazperin you aren't even listening to why I'm saying
KStreetHipster	719313594026844160	2016-04-10T23:58:19	Chazperin fair*
KStreetHipster	719313560870912000	2016-04-10T23:58:11	Chazperin do you think it's fist for people to work 3 jobs? And still to not afford basics?
KStreetHipster	719312959617433600	2016-04-10T23:55:48	Chazperin how can you not see this???
KStreetHipster	719312884421910528	2016-04-10T23:55:30	Chazperin work should produce enough to survive
KStreetHipster	719312825978527744	2016-04-10T23:55:16	Chazperin I'm just asking for fairness. People with 4 jobs should be living well not suffering
KStreetHipster	719312602438901761	2016-04-10T23:54:23	Chazperin they should see rewards too! Not just some of us.
KStreetHipster	719312459060764672	2016-04-10T23:53:49	Chazperin in saying the benefits we saw were *out of proportion* when some people work their whole lives away for a pittance
KStreetHipster	719312209810096128	2016-04-10T23:52:49	Chazperin well right now it's definitely not fair
KStreetHipster	719311975755309058	2016-04-10T23:51:53	Chazperin it's not fair for some people to afford to be Wealthy and others to barely be living
KStreetHipster	719311687346589696	2016-04-10T23:50:45	Chazperin i'm not saying spend more I'm saying tax the people who have the resources necessary to help people's lives
KStreetHipster	719311405099298816	2016-04-10T23:49:37	Chazperin I think we need to share the burdens better so that certain people don't have to suffer so much
KStreetHipster	719311206603816960	2016-04-10T23:48:50	Chazperin but other people sturgeon just to sustain their own life on minimum wage jobs. It's not really fair.
KStreetHipster	719311096868306945	2016-04-10T23:48:24	Chazperin my dad was able to afford all our luxuries on his one salary and stock options. Family of 5. He worked a normal day.
KStreetHipster	719310874075246593	2016-04-10T23:47:31	Chazperin and a great way to help is education and a healthcare safety net. Plus also more fair salaries
KStreetHipster	719310704000405504	2016-04-10T23:46:50	Chazperin in my view we should try and help the ones who need it the most. Not the ones who need it the least.
KStreetHipster	719309685904441345	2016-04-10T23:42:47	Chazperin right now we punish the poor with extra burdens and not enough pay to have *any* luxuries
KStreetHipster	719309516823592960	2016-04-10T23:42:07	Chazperin I don't think it's fair for some people to have to work 4 jobs and barely be alive and others just 1 and have luxuries too
KStreetHipster	719307315006996481	2016-04-10T23:33:22	imillhiser I guess what I meant was some folks have so much wealth they can toss it around recklessly and others so little they die.
KStreetHipster	719306493535760384	2016-04-10T23:30:06	kerl_laura I have no idea what you are talking about.
KStreetHipster	719306384005668864	2016-04-10T23:29:40	Chazperin is there something about investing in necessities instead of luxuries that hurts people? What am I missing?
KStreetHipster	719305432536190976	2016-04-10T23:25:53	All those little contrasts that illustrate the unfairness of the world should be more obvious to us
KStreetHipster	719304032532058112	2016-04-10T23:20:20	Chazperin I'm making a point about investing our resources where they are actually needed. Like education.
KStreetHipster	719303115317489664	2016-04-10T23:16:41	Chazperin not sure what you mean
KStreetHipster	719301881571356672	2016-04-10T23:11:47	myownpetard girl that's not even the worst of it. You should have seen the house I was raised in. You should have seen the backyard.

KStreetHipster	719297462628814849	2016-04-10T22:54:13	Chazperin we are rolling in resources. We just deploy them to benefit the people who already have lots of things.

KStreetHipster	717762618954539008	2016-04-06T17:15:18	KStreetHipster Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan are carrying truly enormous burdens especially given their own tense situations.
KStreetHipster	717762181761261568	2016-04-06T17:13:34	KStreetHipster and worse, you end up with situations like Calais, and commentators rushing to suggest they brought squalor with them...
KStreetHipster	717761950663348224	2016-04-06T17:12:39	What we have essentially done as an international community is punished the most generous nations with the greatest burdens.
KStreetHipster	717761642340098048	2016-04-06T17:11:25	Generous nations like Sweden and Germany would not be in such a bad spot if the rest of the countries had taken more responsibility.
KStreetHipster	717761293327925249	2016-04-06T17:10:02	We all have an obligation to help the vulnerable and especially children. Leaving them in their own personal hell is not an option.
KStreetHipster	717761005992841216	2016-04-06T17:08:53	It's easy to blame Sweden for causing their own problems by accepting too many refugees. But nations who took too few deserve more flack.

KStreetHipster	717359651013001216	2016-04-05T14:34:03	kerl_laura WKowalczykIV I thought the statistics showed that immigrants often commit less crime than domestic residents?
KStreetHipster	717356943375859714	2016-04-05T14:23:17	CouchRambo that's not actually what we do in a crisis though. Instead we lash out in nonsense ways.
KStreetHipster	717356009958694912	2016-04-05T14:19:35	CouchRambo in my view a successful terror attack could have serious consequences on foreign policy and vulnerable ppl here domestically.

KStreetHipster	717350135001276417	2016-04-05T13:56:14	PoliticsInVivo I don't know how to reduce freak out. So we have to do things to make these as infrequent as possible IMO. Should anyway.
KStreetHipster	717346323083583490	2016-04-05T13:41:05	PoliticsInVivo I don't know how to do that.
KStreetHipster	717346084016631810	2016-04-05T13:40:08	PoliticsInVivo it will result in harassment of ppl, threats. Political nationalism. Proposals for more war. It will empower the worst in us
KStreetHipster	717345799546413056	2016-04-05T13:39:00	PoliticsInVivo when 9/11 happened we went on a decade and a half path of national derangement. I'm not assured next time it won't be worse.
KStreetHipster	717345584198234113	2016-04-05T13:38:09	PoliticsInVivo see this is the crazy part. Why is it zero or nothing? How about the legitimacy of just plain reducing risk??
KStreetHipster	717345312570912768	2016-04-05T13:37:04	kevinheaslip Im not demanding or expecting perfection. What I want is for us to take threats seriously &amp; see the full range of consequence.
KStreetHipster	717344783736287233	2016-04-05T13:34:58	kevinheaslip ok whatever
KStreetHipster	717344437018316800	2016-04-05T13:33:36	PoliticsInVivo I think security is necessary to reduce risk. And I think the risk of even one successful attack has major consequences.
KStreetHipster	717344257846026241	2016-04-05T13:32:53	kevinheaslip what if it's used to extort a high level official for classified Intel?
KStreetHipster	717344146206273536	2016-04-05T13:32:26	PoliticsInVivo if studies demonstrate that the *show* actually works to deter, then I'm ok with it. doctors still prescribe placebos.
KStreetHipster	717342243598704640	2016-04-05T13:24:53	PoliticsInVivo they usually cite stats about car accidents killing more ppl than terrorism, trying to minimize the importance.
KStreetHipster	717342086115123200	2016-04-05T13:24:15	PoliticsInVivo I'm also talking about terrorism. There are folks who think less security is better, even if it makes attacks easier.
KStreetHipster	717341031629328384	2016-04-05T13:20:04	PoliticsInVivo and when I mention all the ways other nations have gotten it under control they say it's totalitarian and anti-gun.
KStreetHipster	717340427817320448	2016-04-05T13:17:40	PoliticsInVivo no it's not. I see people defend absence of gun control all the time. They think it's an exchange for Liberty.
KStreetHipster	717338286927319040	2016-04-05T13:09:09	Nope 
KStreetHipster	717339213553774592	2016-04-05T13:12:50	PoliticsInVivo do u want me to specify types? Or will it matter to u?
KStreetHipster	717336213846265856	2016-04-05T13:00:55	kevinheaslip no. In the case of a CiA director an affair is a federal crime and a national security concern. I believe ...
KStreetHipster	717332992692064256	2016-04-05T12:48:07	kevinheaslip does this really happen though?
KStreetHipster	717332888270680068	2016-04-05T12:47:42	kevinheaslip not sure I understand
KStreetHipster	717331502057398272	2016-04-05T12:42:12	kevinheaslip i dispute that security means we give up liberties.
KStreetHipster	717327734272208897	2016-04-05T12:27:13	theshaunwalker the consequences aren't just the deaths though. It effects lots of other things.

KStreetHipster	717325344169005057	2016-04-05T12:17:43	CurseYouKhan I think TSA does increase security. Mainly at airports, but planes are Obvi a target.
KStreetHipster	717324556843626496	2016-04-05T12:14:36	I'm not ok with just accepting slaughter as part of the cost of living in the world. It's an argument against trying to make things better.
KStreetHipster	717324178878140416	2016-04-05T12:13:06	They're the same people who see widespread gun deaths and mass shootings and try to tell us "oh hey but cars kill people too"
KStreetHipster	717323953451044864	2016-04-05T12:12:12	Anti-security libertarians are remarkably comfy with making attacks easier. They see it as giving us all more Liberty.

KStreetHipster	717319994309083136	2016-04-05T11:56:28	nonya_bidniss faineg I think another 9/11 would cause another decade of fucked up priorities and war and hate against immigrants.
KStreetHipster	717319733398274048	2016-04-05T11:55:26	Bsilverstrim77 a successful attack would result in more war. More security. Let's agree to at least try not to have that happen, rite?
KStreetHipster	717319521678131200	2016-04-05T11:54:35	ClancyReports I agree there are risks. I just think they are outweighed by the risks of not having that security.
KStreetHipster	717319361233420288	2016-04-05T11:53:57	nonya_bidniss faineg no I'm just not in favor of rolling back current security efforts. TSA, NSA, etc. Another 9/11 would derange us.
KStreetHipster	717319100381331456	2016-04-05T11:52:55	Bsilverstrim77 in my view the single biggest event in American politics in 40 years was 9/11.
KStreetHipster	717318857434632192	2016-04-05T11:51:57	theshaunwalker yes I agree. But we beat acknowledge that humans will human.
KStreetHipster	717318766736986117	2016-04-05T11:51:35	Bsilverstrim77 the odds go up if we reduce security. As Cato wants us to do.
KStreetHipster	717318673543737346	2016-04-05T11:51:13	Bsilverstrim77 I'm saying the risk is very high of sweeping problems due to a successful attack.
KStreetHipster	717318532275445760	2016-04-05T11:50:39	nonya_bidniss faineg and I think it would be bad for us to go through that again. Another decade of war and hysteria? Pass.
KStreetHipster	717318346421604353	2016-04-05T11:49:55	Bsilverstrim77 I'm ok with doing things on that.

KStreetHipster	717318072667738112	2016-04-05T11:48:50	theshaunwalker I think a successful attack would be bad for infrastructure spending and bad for many many other things.
KStreetHipster	717317358805729280	2016-04-05T11:46:00	KStreetHipster Yes, car wrecks do kill far more people annually - but symbolic value *matters* to humans, it always will.
KStreetHipster	717317882753855488	2016-04-05T11:48:05	b0nk_ Cato favors there being no more TSA.
KStreetHipster	717317820627812354	2016-04-05T11:47:50	b0nk_ I'm defending existing security.
KStreetHipster	717317710535794688	2016-04-05T11:47:23	theshaunwalker how much would have been spent on war instead of infrastructure after an attack or two ????
KStreetHipster	717317590368985088	2016-04-05T11:46:55	Bsilverstrim77 to me the threat of terrorism is a lot more than dead bodies from the explosion.
KStreetHipster	717317281345241090	2016-04-05T11:45:41	When you look at the wide angle lens of a successful attack's consequence, the security makes a lot more sense.
KStreetHipster	717317124151054336	2016-04-05T11:45:04	It would cause greater harassment of refugees and immigrants in the country. It would result in people's whole lives being harder.
KStreetHipster	717316649473302529	2016-04-05T11:43:10	It would effect the economy. Air travel in perpetuity. It would encourage reactionary politics. These are things to secure against.
KStreetHipster	717316424226582529	2016-04-05T11:42:17	Do we really think if the Brussels bombing happened here that the *only* problem would be the people that died? Surely not.

KStreetHipster	717315716903337984	2016-04-05T11:39:28	It's not just the risk of a tragedy that makes me support security. It's knowledge that a successful attack has political consequence.

KStreetHipster	716808128772251649	2016-04-04T02:02:30	A billionaire can make 30 Million dollars a year just earning 3% interest on their money.

KStreetHipster	716370086974468096	2016-04-02T21:01:52	How can you be a progressive and think of the workers as necessarily aligned with employers? Where did you get that?
KStreetHipster	716369749324615680	2016-04-02T21:00:32	Employees aren't generally considered vessels of their employers'. Quite the opposite: the history of labor shows the two groups in tension.
KStreetHipster	716369370964832257	2016-04-02T20:59:02	Now I've seen a version of this with the "Hillary gets money from Big Oil" smear. She's received donations from EMPLOYEES of oil companies.

KStreetHipster	716720953720381440	2016-04-03T20:16:06	DAChesney yeah that doesn't make any sense to me.
KStreetHipster	716720889690083329	2016-04-03T20:15:50	DAChesney instead of leaving the big problems to a deity, we begin to tackle them ourselves, two hands working instead of praying.
KStreetHipster	716720742151262208	2016-04-03T20:15:15	DAChesney atheism is empowering, putting the focus back in our own responsibilities to the world and each other, knowing we are all we have
KStreetHipster	716720501377249280	2016-04-03T20:14:18	DAChesney in my view tossing our responsibility to god diminishes our own role. We should do better by ourselves. Care for our planet.
KStreetHipster	716720333655375872	2016-04-03T20:13:38	DAChesney none of those things make me broken. They make me human and normal. Any moral progress I make will be done by me, not some deity.
KStreetHipster	716719586763091968	2016-04-03T20:10:40	DAChesney I find that pretty insulting tbh. I'm not broken. Children are not broken. Hard for me to take that seriously.
KStreetHipster	716719322194771968	2016-04-03T20:09:37	DAChesney ok well the "without precluding evidence" part is a problem. Because there IS evidence of evolution.
KStreetHipster	716719053528641536	2016-04-03T20:08:33	FreeThinker420 RockyinTX but I'm not an expert
KStreetHipster	716719003616448512	2016-04-03T20:08:21	FreeThinker420 RockyinTX in other words a poll of 1200 often has the same result as a poll of 50,000.
KStreetHipster	716718894405132289	2016-04-03T20:07:55	FreeThinker420 RockyinTX I think statisticians have a range of 600-1500 and after that larger sample sizes generally get the same result.
KStreetHipster	716718654159630336	2016-04-03T20:06:57	DAChesney if you don't feel compelled to base views on evidence then the sky is the limit. It encourages wild ideas to be believed.
KStreetHipster	716718144379686912	2016-04-03T20:04:56	DAChesney it's unreasonable because it's a large claim based on no evidence.
KStreetHipster	716717946362396672	2016-04-03T20:04:09	DAChesney it causes people to discriminate against gay and trans people. It's not innocuous
KStreetHipster	716717868235120645	2016-04-03T20:03:50	DAChesney we lost ten years of potential progress on stem cells due to this getting in the way
KStreetHipster	716717740103368704	2016-04-03T20:03:19	DAChesney but the tangible things that people choose to ignore because of faith are harmful! Medicine and biology!
KStreetHipster	716717549795221504	2016-04-03T20:02:34	DAChesney I'm comfy with saying "I don't know" way more than attributing mysteries to the supernatural.
KStreetHipster	716717307037294592	2016-04-03T20:01:36	DAChesney I'm not saying we can understand all things. I'm saying its a reasonable method of learning things. Quit twisting my words.
KStreetHipster	716717108873142272	2016-04-03T20:00:49	FreeThinker420 RockyinTX polls don't actually ask questions to all of the people. It's a sampling sufficient to obtain a reliable measure.
KStreetHipster	716716895936774144	2016-04-03T19:59:58	DAChesney JoeCleary2 I'm not sure what that means
KStreetHipster	716716765137383424	2016-04-03T19:59:27	DAChesney Darwin is not some kind of messiah to me. Science is honest, not infallible. We get better at it over time.
KStreetHipster	716716615916609536	2016-04-03T19:58:51	DAChesney ultimate truth? I'm not making a claim that there is not more to learn. I'm saying it's reasonable and evidence based.
KStreetHipster	716716351058944000	2016-04-03T19:57:48	DAChesney JoeCleary2 I think more people need to base their views on measurable facts if at all possible. Instead of the supernatural.
KStreetHipster	716716221937233920	2016-04-03T19:57:17	DAChesney JoeCleary2 to me it's stuff like that that causes civic discourse to be harder, not understanding separation of church/state
KStreetHipster	716715890654314496	2016-04-03T19:55:58	DAChesney JoeCleary2 because apparently enough people are taught that that most people believe it
KStreetHipster	716715752401690624	2016-04-03T19:55:25	DAChesney JoeCleary2 do you think it's ok for a majority of Americans to believe Christianity is written into the constitution?
KStreetHipster	716715552929030144	2016-04-03T19:54:38	DAChesney a full 42% of Americans think evolution is a lie. That didn't happen by accident and it's not good for education.
KStreetHipster	716715426588196864	2016-04-03T19:54:08	DAChesney look, if an ideology is causing serious social ills I'm going to point it out. Not sit idly and quiet about it.
KStreetHipster	716715171406675969	2016-04-03T19:53:07	FreeThinker420 RockyinTX it's a Gallup poll of Americans
KStreetHipster	716714989524897792	2016-04-03T19:52:24	DAChesney JoeCleary2 then why is it always the most religious people who oppose fair marriage laws? And who oppose the safety net?
KStreetHipster	716714284097536000	2016-04-03T19:49:35	DAChesney JoeCleary2 there's no doubt it has slowed down and delayed research on stem cells &amp; led to widespread science skepticism
KStreetHipster	716714077658066944	2016-04-03T19:48:46	DAChesney JoeCleary2 it's also causing many people to act in a discriminatory manner toward commonly victimized groups, like trans ppl
KStreetHipster	716713819871969280	2016-04-03T19:47:45	DAChesney JoeCleary2 in my view it causes large numbers of people to deny reality. Like evolution, for example.
KStreetHipster	716712988044959744	2016-04-03T19:44:26	DAChesney JoeCleary2 ex post facto?
KStreetHipster	716712086529642496	2016-04-03T19:40:51	DAChesney JoeCleary2 or maybe things are just pretty cool without any magic happening. IMO.
KStreetHipster	716711731939008512	2016-04-03T19:39:27	DAChesney JoeCleary2 I just think it's ok to describe that *feeling* as lacking evidence. Faith is belief in things without reason for it.
KStreetHipster	716711495040565249	2016-04-03T19:38:30	DAChesney JoeCleary2 I agree that's the case. It doesn't really make logical sense to me, but I agree most people feel that way.

KStreetHipster	716696327107846144	2016-04-03T18:38:14	Congress needs more scientists. People who are intellectually curious, methodical in approach, non-ideological.

KStreetHipster	716686855681343488	2016-04-03T18:00:36	JoeCleary2 and the fact that you aren't doesn't make me guilty of stereotyping. Im still using real data.
KStreetHipster	716686345825943553	2016-04-03T17:58:34	Especially if you're gonna do that in the context of a discussion that is literally about honesty and inquiry...

KStreetHipster	716683885141057537	2016-04-03T17:48:48	Friendly reminder that 42% think evolution is a lie. It's disingenuous to keep saying this is a small % of ppl.

KStreetHipster	716682617261674496	2016-04-03T17:43:45	JoeCleary2 that seems to conflict with the whole believing in massive claims without evidence thing. üò∂

KStreetHipster	716680309786284032	2016-04-03T17:34:35	JoeCleary2 not to mention the honesty and inquiry part at the end is often fiercely combatted by religious adherents.

KStreetHipster	716646440659869696	2016-04-03T15:20:00	But for most people who make a hobby of reading poetry, he is a guilty pleasure. In small doses. 
KStreetHipster	716646131061526528	2016-04-03T15:18:46	People avoid reading Bukowski because he was a rake and an ass. And because people excited by his poetry are often rakes and assholes.

KStreetHipster	716402337472913408	2016-04-02T23:10:02	I've done it too liberally as a cautionary measure and even in unreasonable anger. But it's necessary to an extent.
KStreetHipster	716402128038723584	2016-04-02T23:09:12	We can all do a better job of punishing bad behavior with unfollows and blocks tbh. The more we self-police, the better this place is.
KStreetHipster	716401934882570240	2016-04-02T23:08:26	I've been lucky to have built so many relationships here. It's the exception. Hard to get established into a Twitter community.
KStreetHipster	716401571018354689	2016-04-02T23:06:59	But even I know that this could change at any moment, and has before, due to bad actors. That makes me terribly sad.
KStreetHipster	716401406438080512	2016-04-02T23:06:20	As an introvert, Twitter has so much value to me. As a way to share and be social without the stress.
KStreetHipster	716401226292695040	2016-04-02T23:05:37	I thought about quitting Twitter for basically the third time. But I didnt. This place has so many redeeming features.
KStreetHipster	716400801367793664	2016-04-02T23:03:55	Someone figured out my workplace&amp; literally called my boss. To point her to my tweets. This was *after* I had been fired from a previous job
KStreetHipster	716400316443308032	2016-04-02T23:02:00	And it's not just egg accounts either. It's established tweeters. With thousands of followers. They can be scum too.
KStreetHipster	716400117410955264	2016-04-02T23:01:12	It's sad. This could be such a better place if it weren't for the 2% who abuse people. And humiliate and harass them.
KStreetHipster	716399871792521216	2016-04-02T23:00:14	But it really had an impression on me. And scared me. And has made me skeptical of sharing personal details and opening up on here.
KStreetHipster	716399557030973440	2016-04-02T22:58:59	Ever since the harassment episode before New Years... I've probably been too quick to block people. I'm trying to be less trigger happy.

KStreetHipster	716305824231006209	2016-04-02T16:46:31	The fact that they shrug at insubstantial banking reform sort of surprises me. 2008 was proof the risk is high under the status quo.

KStreetHipster	716304646965334016	2016-04-02T16:41:50	4. To me, one of the best reasons to have faith in the American Economy is that those with lots to lose have an interest in its stability.

KStreetHipster	716304114905260033	2016-04-02T16:39:43	2. Then why do interests with a stake in the economy's long term health and stability seem to shrug at regulating those higher risk sectors?
KStreetHipster	716303839763116032	2016-04-02T16:38:38	1. If we acknowledge that some sectors of the whole economy carry greater risk to the whole economy than others, like investment banking...
