jasonfried	709946895330779136	2016-03-16T03:38:24	adamwride yes, same sort of idea! So much better than going to a store to fake try a stove. You can‚Äôt even do it.
jasonfried	709946695405019136	2016-03-16T03:37:37	mitchellholder No it‚Äôs not. The car is, but the brand isn‚Äôt. Big difference.

jasonfried	709946341976182784	2016-03-16T03:36:12	staypufd gruber Yes, but it‚Äôs not the same as seeing the 4 rings in the rental car center. ‚ÄúSilvercar‚Äù is not the car brand. Audi is.
jasonfried	709945965851979776	2016-03-16T03:34:43	gruber Imagine the rental car center. Hertz, Dollar, Budget, Mercedes Benz, Alamo‚Ä¶ Easy choice if you have the money.
jasonfried	709945644387971072	2016-03-16T03:33:26	orangetrulo elonmusk Yes, except with Tesla you have to find a charger, which is difficult as a rental experience. Unpredictable.
jasonfried	709945475806273536	2016-03-16T03:32:46	gruber esp business travelers. Who go home with a new idea in their head when they get into their home car. ‚ÄúMan, that A6 was nice.‚Äù
jasonfried	709943936702238720	2016-03-16T03:26:39	phuggins silvercar Great service, but it‚Äôs not Audi the brand. Not the four rings. Not the brand language or design details.
jasonfried	709943752446468096	2016-03-16T03:25:55	‚ÄúClobbers‚Äù is such an under-appreciated word.

jasonfried	709943013254901760	2016-03-16T03:22:59	atestu Depends who you are and what you want. There are a lot of different kinds people out there.
jasonfried	709942866999582723	2016-03-16T03:22:24	brettbivens heathr gruber An ‚ÄúAudi‚Äù is not ‚ÄúAudi‚Äù. You drive one with Silvercar, yes, but the brand experience is not Audi.
jasonfried	709942159495933954	2016-03-16T03:19:35	doughamlin Not at the start, but eventually likely.
jasonfried	709941818847170563	2016-03-16T03:18:14	TLewisII Absolutely.
jasonfried	709941775079571456	2016-03-16T03:18:03	orangetrulo Yup, not the same. They rent ‚ÄúAudis‚Äù but it‚Äôs not ‚ÄúAudi‚Äù. Very different thing.
jasonfried	709941513782886400	2016-03-16T03:17:01	atestu And? By that logic none of these brands would exist. Enough people want more than A to B.
jasonfried	709939947831033856	2016-03-16T03:10:48	Justyn Yup, stuff like that. I‚Äôd buy that.

jasonfried	709938840408969217	2016-03-16T03:06:24	heathr gruber Yes, but that is not the same as Audi renting Audis. An Audi presence is different than someone renting Audis.
jasonfried	709938369753579520	2016-03-16T03:04:32	benlilley Maybe they don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre in that business, but seems like a real opportunity to me. Esp biz travelers.

jasonfried	709937467500027904	2016-03-16T03:00:56	onedurr Yup, Silvercar is great. Not what I‚Äôm talking about though.
jasonfried	709937173487702016	2016-03-16T02:59:46	jtth Absolutely! Sell the experience!
jasonfried	709937066990174208	2016-03-16T02:59:21	twbrandt silvercar Yup had a great experience with Silvercar. I‚Äôm a fan, but also because I‚Äôm an Audi fan.
jasonfried	709936991878512641	2016-03-16T02:59:03	bensternke silvercar yeah I had a great experience.
jasonfried	709936947318235136	2016-03-16T02:58:52	Fuck Hertz, Dollar, Budget, etc at the Airports. Why aren‚Äôt Audi, Mercedes, Volvo, etc there? Perfect time for an extended test drive!
jasonfried	709936623408906244	2016-03-16T02:57:35	karenbdc Yup, exactly!
jasonfried	709936528886116352	2016-03-16T02:57:13	noahchestnut So someone would have to innovate.
jasonfried	709936475266154496	2016-03-16T02:57:00	But you have to know that‚Äôs possible, and the rest of the experience (pick up, drop off, etc) was decidedly not ‚ÄúAudi‚Äù. So not the same.
jasonfried	709936325135179776	2016-03-16T02:56:24	I specifically rented with silvercar last time I was at SFO because I own an Audi and wanted a familiar experience on the road.
jasonfried	709936228729167872	2016-03-16T02:56:01	karenbdc Same!
jasonfried	709936060134875136	2016-03-16T02:55:21	anditto_h Very cool - didn‚Äôt know that.

jasonfried	709935734958886912	2016-03-16T02:54:03	twbrandt silvercar Yup it‚Äôs great, but it‚Äôs not the same, investment or not. You know what I‚Äôm trying to say here.
jasonfried	709935645179777024	2016-03-16T02:53:42	briankmcclave silvercar Have used Silvercar. It‚Äôs great, but nothing at all like I just described. Not attached to the brand.
jasonfried	709935556495597569	2016-03-16T02:53:21	iheartcrowds Right now extend that across cities when I travel.

jasonfried	709935375448350721	2016-03-16T02:52:38	dijama Yup, used them. Great service.
jasonfried	709935167880564736	2016-03-16T02:51:48	gamechange silvercar Just used Silvercar in SFO. Was great.
jasonfried	709935092882255872	2016-03-16T02:51:30	.taylorpeck Yes even that. Say I own an A4. Let me drive an A6 when I‚Äôm traveling.

jasonfried	709934639117242368	2016-03-16T02:49:42	I recognize rental may not be a biz these brands want to get into, but I‚Äôd love to see at least one do it well. Just opining.
jasonfried	709934491502907392	2016-03-16T02:49:07	‚Ä¶the brand could keep me an Audi driver, or a Tesla driver. Look at the whole experience of driving a brand, not just when I‚Äôm home.
jasonfried	709934359306895361	2016-03-16T02:48:35	If I own a Tesla in Chicago, and fly to BWI, I‚Äôd love to have a Tesla waiting for me when I arrive. That would be a driver‚Äôs experience‚Ä¶
jasonfried	709934138678059011	2016-03-16T02:47:43	‚Ä¶I‚Äôd like to drive an Audi when I travel somewhere else. Why does Audi want me renting a Benz or BMW by chance?
jasonfried	709934004707811329	2016-03-16T02:47:11	I remain surprised that car manufactures today don‚Äôt let you take their brand with you when you travel. Like if I own an Audi‚Ä¶
jasonfried	709933753166987265	2016-03-16T02:46:11	sjaay doesn‚Äôt sound future changing enough to me. Another luxury car doesn‚Äôt sound Apple enough. Too common.
jasonfried	709933279265169408	2016-03-16T02:44:18	‚Ä¶always the same brand of car (Apple), and always a quality experience. Apple-genius-style drivers - professional, courteous, trustworthy.

jasonfried	709930035495317505	2016-03-16T02:31:24	jpbobbaers Yeah - what I wasn‚Äôt clear about was your reference to REWORK and the API. That was the question I was referring to.

jasonfried	706907888300597248	2016-03-07T18:22:28	alexlmiller rossipedia so humans and tools. Tools are a lot easier to change than people.
jasonfried	706907788186791936	2016-03-07T18:22:05	alexlmiller rossipedia yes but tools are designed and those designs encourage certain behaviors, like it or not. Tools are the prob too‚Ä¶
jasonfried	706907457163960321	2016-03-07T18:20:46	jasonlynes it‚Äôs brutal. What‚Äôs worse is that a lot of companies don‚Äôt realize it yet. Lots of silent suffering.
jasonfried	706899198361243649	2016-03-07T17:47:57	efader this isn‚Äôt about slack - it‚Äôs about any group chat tool. Slack is one. Campfire inside Basecamp is another.

jasonfried	706895897947275264	2016-03-07T17:34:50	gnrlbzik There are no silver bullets. It‚Äôs a collection of small things, nudges, expectations, timing, etc.
jasonfried	706894494075990016	2016-03-07T17:29:15	Don‚Äôt expect a reaction, expect consideration. Expect complete thoughts from people. Your expectations help guide people.
jasonfried	706894211111497731	2016-03-07T17:28:08	gnrlbzik That‚Äôs cultural. Recognizing very few things matter *right now*. Giving people time to think, not expecting a reaction.
jasonfried	706894039237271552	2016-03-07T17:27:27	ferani always some exceptions, of course.
jasonfried	706893981058076673	2016-03-07T17:27:13	tristanharris chrismessina anildash Even better. Let me know how I can help. Deeply interested this. Tweaking our company around it.
jasonfried	706893831698944000	2016-03-07T17:26:37	A summary next day is too late if the *expectation* is always about right now. Chat‚Äôs problems are as much about expectation as execution.

jasonfried	706893211520774144	2016-03-07T17:24:09	yaroslav it‚Äôs shaped by both. The tools we use encourage default behaviors. You can‚Äôt separate them from the outcomes.
jasonfried	706893035460661248	2016-03-07T17:23:27	yaroslav absolutely true. Not suggesting otherwise.

jasonfried	706892833525932033	2016-03-07T17:22:39	anildash Yup, chat is wonderful at the fun stuff. I called that out in the article.
jasonfried	706892687161462784	2016-03-07T17:22:04	Giving someone your full attention is giving them your respect. Partial attention is disrespectful when someone expects your full attention.
jasonfried	706892449671589888	2016-03-07T17:21:08	oiler noahchestnut not just chat. Anything that pulls your attention. Giving someone your full attention is giving them your respect.
jasonfried	706892292766834688	2016-03-07T17:20:30	yaroslav that‚Äôs not the solution if there‚Äôs an *expectation* that you‚Äôre seeing this stuff and supposed to be responding in real-time.
jasonfried	706892194666323969	2016-03-07T17:20:07	anildash @NightCapOnTV agree with that too.

jasonfried	706891898493870080	2016-03-07T17:18:56	joshlong ‚Äúlive thinking‚Äù = reactions. Sometimes useful, no doubt. But not as the default method of communicating with a group.

jasonfried	706891154420203520	2016-03-07T17:15:59	@NightCapOnTV anildash to me it‚Äôs about emai/telework - it‚Äôs about always on (even during the day) expectations. Unhealthy.
jasonfried	706890992087994368	2016-03-07T17:15:20	sph No doubt, but tools also have default behaviors designed into them, so tools are at fault as well. Including Basecamp.

jasonfried	706878223133462528	2016-03-07T16:24:36	mmcwatters ;)
jasonfried	706876924753096704	2016-03-07T16:19:26	mmcwatters Example right there! Tweets themselves are like chat lines. Incomplete thoughts one after another.
jasonfried	706876382739976192	2016-03-07T16:17:17	mmcwatters yes, except some methods are line-by-line and others are thought-by-thought. The later leads to better outcomes in most cases.

jasonfried	705789265867730944	2016-03-04T16:17:28	cwodtke No doubt. Tools make suggestions. They behave in certain default ways.
jasonfried	705780864072855554	2016-03-04T15:44:05	cwodtke it‚Äôs not just slack - slack is an implementation. It‚Äôs *any* group chat tool - it‚Äôs the medium, not the product.
jasonfried	705780691158458368	2016-03-04T15:43:24	cwodtke all depends on how you use chat, but the way most people use it, and the way it‚Äôs encouraged to be used, it‚Äôs a black hole.
jasonfried	705780595675168768	2016-03-04T15:43:01	cwodtke Oh yeah - very bad.

jasonfried	686904581918437376	2016-01-12T13:36:29	PR3SIDENT yup which is why companies should be flexible. 8/8/8 doesn‚Äôt have to mean a continuous 8 at work.
jasonfried	686904335524061184	2016-01-12T13:35:30	_ don‚Äôt know, haven‚Äôt asked him.
jasonfried	686904236672684033	2016-01-12T13:35:06	anildash amen to that.
jasonfried	686904172990590977	2016-01-12T13:34:51	One reason people are working longer hours is because we can‚Äôt get work done at work: 
jasonfried	686903593035821057	2016-01-12T13:32:33	BobaFaux spot on.
jasonfried	686903517936758784	2016-01-12T13:32:15	anildash spot on.
jasonfried	686903368086876160	2016-01-12T13:31:39	thomasfuchs because ‚Äúhard‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean anything. If you‚Äôre talking manual labor that‚Äôs one thing. That‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre talking about.
jasonfried	686903098061754369	2016-01-12T13:30:35	gloom303 yup duration doesn‚Äôt equal effort. Pushing back agains 60 or 70 hours means you are working harder than someone who puts in 40.
jasonfried	686902875251933184	2016-01-12T13:29:42	PR3SIDENT I think it‚Äôs a human idea. Provides plenty of time for work and life outside of work. And a full night‚Äôs sleep.
jasonfried	686902504764772353	2016-01-12T13:28:13	What I‚Äôm trying to push back on is the mythology around duration equaling effort. Duration is duration. That‚Äôs it‚Ä¶
jasonfried	686901967755587585	2016-01-12T13:26:05	atestu correct!
jasonfried	686901818648084480	2016-01-12T13:25:30	GHarpreet pmarca ‚Ä¶and it often leads to failure outside of work too. Busted relationships, stress-induced health issues, etc.
jasonfried	686901667858657280	2016-01-12T13:24:54	GHarpreet pmarca Yes it can happen, but when it‚Äôs sustained I believe it may point to corporate structural failure‚Ä¶
jasonfried	686901045763698688	2016-01-12T13:22:25	Working more than 40 hours a week doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre working hard. It just means you are working more than 40 hours a week.
jasonfried	686900612173312000	2016-01-12T13:20:42	pmarca and 40 hours gives you plenty of time to work hard. And sleep well.
