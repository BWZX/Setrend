RJSzczerba	719520600935526401	2016-04-11T13:40:53	AutismU I think your approach is fine - my issue is that candidates can't find these employers and most employers don't understand autism
RJSzczerba	719520023065313280	2016-04-11T13:38:36	AutismU I know ABA very well. How does ABA help an individual get better access to companies looking to hire people with autism?
RJSzczerba	719511810290892800	2016-04-11T13:05:58	AutismU Did you even read the article? It focusses on need for technology to enable better access to jobs. This has nothing to do with ABA.
