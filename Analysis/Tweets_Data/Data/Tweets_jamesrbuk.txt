jamesrbuk	725648323558907904	2016-04-28T11:30:16	Now 21 Labour MPs have called on Corbyn to suspend Livingstone. Here's the list:  
jamesrbuk	725649565114880000	2016-04-28T11:35:12	Imagine being a Labour council, Welsh assembly or Scottish Parliament candidate today. Poor bastards.
jamesrbuk	725649199283474433	2016-04-28T11:33:45	David Cameron could use his press conference today to set fire to a puppy and he'd still not get the worst headlines of the day
jamesrbuk	725647343601745920	2016-04-28T11:26:23	Imagine being a Jewish viewer watching Labour's former London mayor discuss Hitler's more moderate "early years" approach to Jews on BBC 2.
jamesrbuk	725647995979595776	2016-04-28T11:28:58	Ken on Hitler: "He was a monster from start to finish. But it's simply the historical fact... his policy was to send Jews to Israel".
jamesrbuk	725648042569961474	2016-04-28T11:29:09	This  
jamesrbuk	725648020893761536	2016-04-28T11:29:04	‚ÄúI‚Äôve not said that Hitler was a Zionist," says Ken Livingstone. He said Hitler was "supporting Zionism". 
jamesrbuk	725646006101118976	2016-04-28T11:21:04	Question is whether Ken is confident about his position with Labour's leadership, or over-confident 
jamesrbuk	725644646186123265	2016-04-28T11:15:40	Labour has both a real problem and a PR problem with anti-semitism and is currently looking spectacularly incapable of handling either
jamesrbuk	725644425079209986	2016-04-28T11:14:47	So we're now on day three of what should've been a relatively easily handled backbench scandal for Labour. Ken has guaranteed a day four.
jamesrbuk	725643420476264448	2016-04-28T11:10:47	"A real antisemite doesn't just hate the Jews in Israel," is literally, word for word, what Ken Livingstone just said on the television.

jamesrbuk	711979573324488705	2016-03-21T18:15:32	Crabb is being reported as "no new welfare cuts". tnewtondunn quotes treasury saying "no PLANS for new welfare cuts". Huge difference.
jamesrbuk	711979312648425473	2016-03-21T18:14:30	DWP and Treasury need to quickly agree what Stephen Crabb said. If they don't manage it before first editions they've got days of mess ahead
jamesrbuk	711979100114649090	2016-03-21T18:13:40	WoutervD Yep. I did only reply at 5:30 so there's a chance it's still in transit
jamesrbuk	711977686411902976	2016-03-21T18:08:03	p26 of Budget Red Book requires ¬£3bn pa further cuts to meet Osborne welfare cap. Has he ditched that or not? Crabbe refuses to answer my Q.
jamesrbuk	711977775385726976	2016-03-21T18:08:24	WoutervD I have already replied, as it happens...
jamesrbuk	711976647768076288	2016-03-21T18:03:55	If the UC runs slow again, potential overspends are in the same ballpark as for the NHS. HMT's incentives are now to make it work. (2/2)
jamesrbuk	711975793929404416	2016-03-21T18:00:31	The Crabb announcement is, in effect, doubling down on Universal Credit. They get ¬£5b (gross) from UC reducing entitlements by 2020. (1/2)
jamesrbuk	711975469072130048	2016-03-21T17:59:14	Treasury swiftly clarifying Crabb declaration on welfare cuts. Doesn't at all mean no more cuts in this parliament, just none planned. Ah.
jamesrbuk	711976145693102080	2016-03-21T18:01:55	stephenkb ...follow GO as chancellor? There is a mess coming, even if his target is ditched (tho that would help).
jamesrbuk	711976047282135040	2016-03-21T18:01:32	stephenkb Given the horrible fiscal timebombs that have been set in 2019/20 (and even more so the few years after) who would want to...
jamesrbuk	711975845502570498	2016-03-21T18:00:44	stephenkb It's pretty unlikely for neither 2 nor 3 to happen in the next few years, imo.

jamesrbuk	711975550236147714	2016-03-21T17:59:33	adamjfarrow If you think gay men still have prejudice outside that group (which surely we do), then that rep is still valid.
jamesrbuk	711975438994776064	2016-03-21T17:59:07	adamjfarrow Even accepting premise that gay men face no prejudice with LGBT+ population (which I don't, necessarily)
jamesrbuk	711975337438158849	2016-03-21T17:58:42	adamjfarrow Looks slightly to me like the point of a gay men's rep is missed: do gay men not need a safe space?
jamesrbuk	711975093329661952	2016-03-21T17:57:44	stephenkb It would be a lot easier if you just read my argument (which is about 5 tweets long) rather than guessed at it instead.

jamesrbuk	711973854982369283	2016-03-21T17:52:49	Gov currently has ¬£4.4bn to find from PIP u-turn &amp; ¬£3.5bn in unspecified departmental cuts. Scrapping UC would now be *expensive*.
jamesrbuk	711973146652491777	2016-03-21T17:50:00	Universal credit cuts are already costed in and worth ¬£2.7bn a year (twice was PIP cuts were). They'd hit hard:

jamesrbuk	711972272366608384	2016-03-21T17:46:32	The main welfare cut slated by the government is the "scrapped" tax credit cuts, which are now being phased in with universal credit.
jamesrbuk	711972134826975232	2016-03-21T17:45:59	Big, but not as big as it sounds: there are *huge* future cuts already on the slate.
