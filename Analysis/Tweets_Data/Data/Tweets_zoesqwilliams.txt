zoesqwilliams	705368695040811009	2016-03-03T12:26:16	Kate_Butler I would say, can I find a way to feel differently about this?
zoesqwilliams	705368553780854785	2016-03-03T12:25:42	Kate_Butler And at all levels of journalism. But I certainly wouldn't blame the entire readership, and say, "in future, I'll just shut up"

zoesqwilliams	705368130864979972	2016-03-03T12:24:02	Kate_Butler there is nothing insulting about discussing it, any more than discussing any other theory of mind - freudianism, say.

zoesqwilliams	694113607387320320	2016-02-01T11:02:34	Sarah29Collins PCollinsTimes jennirsl johnmcternan the point is, is there common ground you could work on? Or nothing but dissonance? &gt;

zoesqwilliams	685228374046969859	2016-01-07T22:35:49	jessbrammar iainmartin1 I won't bore on all night! But there is a difference between reporting resignation and eliciting it on air.
zoesqwilliams	685228253817233408	2016-01-07T22:35:21	jessbrammar iainmartin1 persuading him to resign on air.
zoesqwilliams	685227978339532800	2016-01-07T22:34:15	RKWinvisibleman iainmartin1 'kay. He is a jerk, then. Daily Politics fulfils its brief of broadcast impartiality. *almost convinced*
zoesqwilliams	685227638106009600	2016-01-07T22:32:54	iainmartin1 MsLesleySmith DENZIL WASHINGTON?
zoesqwilliams	685227528743706624	2016-01-07T22:32:28	iainmartin1 of course, then the q is, professional compunction from the impartial beeb or from the politicians?
zoesqwilliams	685227432291483648	2016-01-07T22:32:05	iainmartin1 me either. It seems to me like some professional compunction must've stopped this happening before
zoesqwilliams	685226812734091264	2016-01-07T22:29:37	RupertMyers goddammit
zoesqwilliams	685226258511343616	2016-01-07T22:27:25	To illustrate that this isn't normal for the BBC: how many ministers can you think of who have resigned on air? 
zoesqwilliams	685224957366931456	2016-01-07T22:22:15	MsLesleySmith you too! hope you're well
zoesqwilliams	685224915914637312	2016-01-07T22:22:05	MsLesleySmith but it is, and remains, in a unique position of responsibility
zoesqwilliams	685224792329437186	2016-01-07T22:21:36	MsLesleySmith i guess that's why I am not  as trenchant as I normally would be, that the impartiality of the beeb is partially tacit
zoesqwilliams	685224702495862784	2016-01-07T22:21:14	MsLesleySmith there's a distinction between ofcom rules and the tacit + stated rules of the publicly funded, public service broadcaster
zoesqwilliams	685223881850904576	2016-01-07T22:17:58	RKWinvisibleman winkythehouself highburyonfoot no no no! they asked him to resign on earth
zoesqwilliams	685222829785243648	2016-01-07T22:13:48	MsLesleySmith no they're allowed to break stories! but manufacturing them is a little bit different
zoesqwilliams	685222387806277632	2016-01-07T22:12:02	MsLesleySmith but as I say, I don't know where I stand
zoesqwilliams	685222298123661312	2016-01-07T22:11:41	MsLesleySmith that is, using the prog like an advert, for his profile. which would have been fine from channel four, but beeb....
zoesqwilliams	685222112198574081	2016-01-07T22:10:57	MsLesleySmith and the second difference is that he was considering resigning, and then she persuaded him to for on air impact
zoesqwilliams	685222027238739973	2016-01-07T22:10:36	MsLesleySmith i think the first difference is that we're not politically impartial and they are.

zoesqwilliams	685218313362878464	2016-01-07T21:55:51	RKWinvisibleman winkythehouself highburyonfoot but I'm not saying that the BBC shouldn't have room for less reputable ones.
zoesqwilliams	685218259805843462	2016-01-07T21:55:38	RKWinvisibleman winkythehouself highburyonfoot so I guess I'm saying that a reputable BBC broadcaster wouldn't do it
zoesqwilliams	685218144282120192	2016-01-07T21:55:10	RKWinvisibleman winkythehouself highburyonfoot well...  put it this way, if someone like Eddie Mair did it, I'd be really surprised
