VolSlinger	720388521060642816	2016-04-13T23:09:42	Of course, I'm talking my book as I'm close to max long theta currently
VolSlinger	720388394237456385	2016-04-13T23:09:12	It might not payout but given the in progress and impending breakouts in some stks, combined with cheap vol, you'd be nuts not 2b long gamma

VolSlinger	709072286159134720	2016-03-13T17:43:01	The index moves are masking a lot of what's going on under the surface (see factor baskets)

VolSlinger	705578111296008192	2016-03-04T02:18:25	The real answer is probably more along the lines of, those who have even a shred of a clue, stay far away from politics
