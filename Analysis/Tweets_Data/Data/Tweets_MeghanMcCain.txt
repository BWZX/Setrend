MeghanMcCain	704297028369715200	2016-02-29T13:27:51	Here's our piece on Trump from last night...
MeghanMcCain	704365014581440513	2016-02-29T17:58:00	Since everything in this election cycle is lowest common denominator - Donald Trump really has the grossest, stubbiest, sausage hands
MeghanMcCain	704331627057520640	2016-02-29T15:45:20	Coburn spent his political career fighting to improve the country with conservative solutions. Glad to have him on TeamRubio. NeverTrump
MeghanMcCain	704325990420344832	2016-02-29T15:22:56	Coburn was a principled populist long before it was cool, and he loathes Donald Trump's con game on voters. 
MeghanMcCain	704324710113239040	2016-02-29T15:17:51	This is the real Marco. Wished he'd ditched the talking points earlier, and just called Trump "Stubbyfingers" on debate stage.
MeghanMcCain	703941843348647936	2016-02-28T13:56:28	Meg Whitman, Christie's national finance co-chair, slays both Christie and Trump in one statement. h/t JGreenDC 
MeghanMcCain	703956192570245121	2016-02-28T14:53:29	Trump RT'd a Nazi, quoted Mussolini, attacked judge for being 'Spanish', and refused to condemn the KKK.   That was just the last 24 hours.
MeghanMcCain	703967369824067584	2016-02-28T15:37:54	So everything Trump is saying now is just politics, too? What's for real? What's his true position? 
MeghanMcCain	703395482379427840	2016-02-27T01:45:26	GOP has 2 paths on Trump: Join or die. Either fight like hell to keep Trump from POTUS or join him w/ the hope of mitigating the disaster

MeghanMcCain	703335413549768705	2016-02-26T21:46:44	Christie told McQuaid, who put himself out there when the Union Leader endorsed him,the day after NH primary that he would never back Trump
MeghanMcCain	703334010714456065	2016-02-26T21:41:10	This is what it looks like when the party starts coming apart. A fraction of the party will splinter, costing the GOP seats. Dem Romp.

MeghanMcCain	703329338805063680	2016-02-26T21:22:36	Millennials are also flocking to Sanders because of politicians like Christie - who recently said a vote for Trump is a vote for Hillary.
