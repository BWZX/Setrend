SniperInMahwah	694920414523441152	2016-02-03T16:28:32	What happens around the Banana Land and my backyard is crazy. If I can't turn the story into a TV series, I'lll definitively write a book.

SniperInMahwah	694123206916050944	2016-02-01T11:40:43	RemcoLenterman True.
SniperInMahwah	694122026550820865	2016-02-01T11:36:01	RemcoLenterman Is it true that in 2009, 51% of BATS rebates were paid to 1 single (and affiliated) HFT? 2
SniperInMahwah	694121911568179200	2016-02-01T11:35:34	RemcoLenterman And wasn’t too because BATS and DE were owned by HFT firms who seeded the venues? 1

SniperInMahwah	694079373251612672	2016-02-01T08:46:32	RemcoLenterman I suppose it’s marketing, and such a project (the ‘exchange') needs a lot of marketing? (my supposition)

SniperInMahwah	693027834860867585	2016-01-29T11:08:06	“HFT in the Banana Land” will definitively be a long spin-off of “HFT in my backyard”. Stay tuned if you want to have fun.
