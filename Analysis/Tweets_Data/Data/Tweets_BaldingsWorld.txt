BaldingsWorld	702124971171123200	2016-02-23T13:36:52	prchovanec agscribbler maybe a little but on a cash basis for trade and the overall economy, very accurate headline. Cash is what matters

BaldingsWorld	702124272672759808	2016-02-23T13:34:06	prchovanec agscribbler I believe that is correct. I think this means on real basis no change, on cash basis large negative.
BaldingsWorld	702121004793987074	2016-02-23T13:21:06	prchovanec agscribbler pretty sure they are not real physical imports, just payments

BaldingsWorld	702117644594520064	2016-02-23T13:07:45	prchovanec many sticky parts. For instance, on a cash basis then, this means cashflow not the cashflow of a 7% growth economy
BaldingsWorld	702117370014339074	2016-02-23T13:06:40	prchovanec sticky. According to bank payments: real trade deficit. Reality: most likely goods trade payments disguising capital movements
BaldingsWorld	702114670770044929	2016-02-23T12:55:56	prchovanec By that I mean, people are taking money off the table and leaving China. SOEs wanting to invest don't need to do this.
BaldingsWorld	702114547453317125	2016-02-23T12:55:27	prchovanec The primary reason I think this is negative for China is that this appears to be permanent capital flight. 1/2
BaldingsWorld	702113645715660800	2016-02-23T12:51:52	prchovanec payment and customs discrepancy on goods imports is almost $1t in overpayment=disguised capital outflows. CA free, KA restricted
BaldingsWorld	702113357550080001	2016-02-23T12:50:43	prchovanec disguised. Basically payment discrepancies in most current account between customs and banks are small, except goods imports.

BaldingsWorld	699265273476575232	2016-02-15T16:13:27	6) I'll buy the Beijing competence argument after they untangle some problems not just mandate an asset price. Chinese obviously don't buy
BaldingsWorld	699264918843977728	2016-02-15T16:12:03	5) judging by the past year, Beijing would get a D-, generously. If you're depending on their competence to save, you need a better argument
BaldingsWorld	699264540366741509	2016-02-15T16:10:32	4) anyone can look brilliant following a rising market/setting asset prices. Test when you can't. In past year Beijing's "brilliance" tested
BaldingsWorld	699264047921938432	2016-02-15T16:08:35	3) now Beijing trying to normalize price and people no longer just accepting the limits of the price and conditions.
BaldingsWorld	699263470034907136	2016-02-15T16:06:17	2) As money flooded in people claimed Beijing was brilliant. No, they set an artificially low price and money flooded in.
BaldingsWorld	699263027993038848	2016-02-15T16:04:32	1) China very simple in some ways. Beijing set an asset price (RMB) and for many years people accepted that and made money. Everyone happy
