rationalwalk	703609733593358336	2016-02-27T15:56:47	This is a good sign for repurchases in place of dividends in the medium-to-long term up to IV, not just up to 1.2x BV. More tax efficient.

rationalwalk	703609199113183232	2016-02-27T15:54:40	Historically, I have not included any u/w profits (assumed combined ratio of 100%) when looking at the valuation. Will consider changing.
rationalwalk	703609010168209408	2016-02-27T15:53:55	Inclusion of normalized u/w profits seems reasonable as subs. for y-to-y u/w profits which would create unjustified volatility in true IV.
rationalwalk	703596951477067776	2016-02-27T15:06:00	HardcoreValue I think that at least a conservative normalized u/w profit could plausibly be considered. But it is less conservative.
rationalwalk	703596534923976704	2016-02-27T15:04:20	Most significant item in Buffett's letter from valuation standpoint is acknowledgement that u/w profits should be incl in 2-col valuation.

rationalwalk	698551274208231424	2016-02-13T16:56:16	The_Analyst yes, too high. Here's the article I read 
rationalwalk	698551031567757313	2016-02-13T16:55:19	The_Analyst I read that he was a 50 basis point tax on stock trades and 10 bps on bonds. That seems high to me.

rationalwalk	698521746014470145	2016-02-13T14:58:56	Investors often retroactively rationalize past convictions, converting (usually unintentionally) to something more congruent w/what happened

rationalwalk	698520098923917312	2016-02-13T14:52:24	BRKA BV growth is nearly 10% over the ten year period, but P/B compression reduces the gain on shares to a bit over 8%.
rationalwalk	698519877212991488	2016-02-13T14:51:31	Still, the float based model was pretty naive and not all that conservative. P/b was around 1.5x at the time.
rationalwalk	698519440757956608	2016-02-13T14:49:47	BRKA traded at $88.8K when I wrote the analysis, so compound rate up to today is just over 8%. I guess not too bad considering '08-'09.

rationalwalk	692504734222127104	2016-01-28T00:29:29	Try as I might, I've never understood liking horrible news on FB . Welcome change 
rationalwalk	692504403841060866	2016-01-28T00:28:10	ezyrider well of course they are hoping for the high end. Maybe you should look at luxury autos, both gas &amp; electric rather than just tesla
rationalwalk	692503139623264256	2016-01-28T00:23:09	ezyrider and of course tesla is a small sample size. Maybe include BYD as well although it's not pure play electric.
rationalwalk	692502787456897026	2016-01-28T00:21:45	ezyrider so wouldn't it be better for Apple to buy Tesla even at a premium to market vs developing in house? Maybe that isn't an open.
rationalwalk	692496421950525441	2016-01-27T23:56:27	ezyrider Yes - are you saying economics of electrics will be radically different? If so where is the evidence?
rationalwalk	692496006458556416	2016-01-27T23:54:48	ezyrider Apple very well COULD achieve great success in autos. I have no evidence to think that so at this time. I could very well be wrong
rationalwalk	692495818268475392	2016-01-27T23:54:03	ezyrider Industry since inception  Look at the history and economics.  It is a terrible business for the most part, with some exceptions.
rationalwalk	692495379011649538	2016-01-27T23:52:18	ezyrider If that's not clear enough, I can't provide any more explanation to make it more clear. Sorry.
rationalwalk	692495285654781954	2016-01-27T23:51:56	ezyrider And that I will change opinion if and when information comes to light that leads me to believe Apple can achieve better economics.
rationalwalk	692495194021851140	2016-01-27T23:51:34	ezyrider we are talking in circles. I said that I do not agree with the decision to go into autos based on what I know of the base rates.
rationalwalk	692494037245378560	2016-01-27T23:46:59	ezyrider It goes into Munger's "too hard" pile for me.  And I'm ok with missing upside. If they break through, great, more power to them.
rationalwalk	692493679831990273	2016-01-27T23:45:33	ezyrider even if Jobs was alive, assumption will be that autos are lousy until proven otherwise. Approach DOES limit upside but that's ok.
rationalwalk	692493443269025793	2016-01-27T23:44:37	ezyrider We have evidence Jobs disrupted multiple industries. Not post-Jobs. Not yet. And certainly not in something as different as autos.
rationalwalk	692492739951329280	2016-01-27T23:41:49	ezyrider Again: I approach entry by examining base rates; evidence is required for me to deviate from conclusions I draw from base rates.
rationalwalk	692491908493529093	2016-01-27T23:38:31	ezyrider there is no evidence to convince me that the economics extends to autos. That could change. I'm OK with "missing out" if I'm wrong
rationalwalk	692491323287441410	2016-01-27T23:36:11	ezyrider In other words, I assume the auto business is poor unless presented with information that convinces me otherwise. To each his own.
rationalwalk	692491191082958848	2016-01-27T23:35:40	ezyrider Of course they have done analysis. Point is, my assumption on success in autos corresponds to the base rate (terrible economics).
rationalwalk	692476273306816512	2016-01-27T22:36:23	ezyrider What's base rate wrt to autos being good business? Then, what are  reasons from diverging from base rate in terms of expectations?
rationalwalk	692475739950694402	2016-01-27T22:34:16	ezyrider You have to make decisions w/less than perfect info, even if the decision is to punt. Punting is a decision.
rationalwalk	692473755080249344	2016-01-27T22:26:23	ezyrider In any event, I'm an observer, not a shareholder, just a guy in the peanut gallery along with everyone else.  We will see.
rationalwalk	692473682338410500	2016-01-27T22:26:06	ezyrider Right, we don't have all the information.  That doesn't mean we cannot have opinions based on what we do know.
rationalwalk	692473462212947969	2016-01-27T22:25:13	ezyrider We don't know the specifics. Could be the most amazing revolutionary car since the Model T. We will see. But I doubt it.
rationalwalk	692473371796357126	2016-01-27T22:24:52	ezyrider this indicates that they will invest a large amount of capital in a historically poor business.  That's what we know.
rationalwalk	692473278175277057	2016-01-27T22:24:29	ezyrider We know they have committed to shipping a car by 2019. We know that. We know that they have hired large numbers of engineers.
rationalwalk	692472657657360384	2016-01-27T22:22:01	ezyrider Given Apple's secrecy, will we know anything until they unveil a product? Maybe through leaks, but probably very few.
rationalwalk	692472518096076802	2016-01-27T22:21:28	ezyrider I think that people jump to conclusions about future capex based on number of engineers they have already hired. A large number.
rationalwalk	692471748390969345	2016-01-27T22:18:24	ezyrider well we will see. Jobs isn't around now, remember that.
rationalwalk	692471077885366272	2016-01-27T22:15:45	ezyrider economics has been historically poor. Capital intensive, poor returns on capital, fickle consumer taste, many established brands.
rationalwalk	692469560285491201	2016-01-27T22:09:43	ezyrider I think they should stay away from autos, yes.

rationalwalk	692416528843722753	2016-01-27T18:38:59	ezyrider I think FB more popular because it is more conducive to personal networking than FB. I don't connect w/friends on Twitter usually.
rationalwalk	692416212802768896	2016-01-27T18:37:44	Answer is obvious: Even if a Buffett disciple, if you care about reporting annual results you will always speculate on short term movements.
