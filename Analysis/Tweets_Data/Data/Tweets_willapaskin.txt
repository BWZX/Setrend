willapaskin	688787599947857921	2016-01-17T18:18:55	joereid Memles art is just the word we use to assert tv's right to be taken seriously. When it should be taken seriously bc it's central
willapaskin	688787410931560448	2016-01-17T18:18:10	joereid Memles it can be! Mostly it's like everything else: trashy, junky, fun, bad, entertaining, good in non arty ways.
willapaskin	688787079715749888	2016-01-17T18:16:51	joereid Memles I love a lot that's not. And ignoring the rest is ignoring the stuff that is really in people's lives
willapaskin	688786967975301121	2016-01-17T18:16:24	joereid Memles You have gotten to the heart of a thing about tv criticism! I'm glad tv is sometimes art: most is not...
willapaskin	688786481758994433	2016-01-17T18:14:28	joereid Memles I think that's... trying to smash tv, it's complications, the way it is so lovable when so bad, into another form's praises
willapaskin	688785690654568448	2016-01-17T18:11:20	joereid Memles agree. But knowing reach matters. Mass taste can be bad, of course. But at least we're not pretending niche nbc is mass
willapaskin	688785098850877440	2016-01-17T18:08:59	joereid Memles I like that bubble. But Netflix enables us to pretend the bubble isn't there. And that's, like, dereliction of duty
willapaskin	688784799205556224	2016-01-17T18:07:47	joereid Memles I actually think this is so important! To assume media taste is mass taste is to hide out in a bubble
willapaskin	688784476160290816	2016-01-17T18:06:30	joereid Memles with Mad Men at least we knew it was a fantasy, and we proceeded
willapaskin	688783524946690048	2016-01-17T18:02:43	joereid Memles the reason they actually matter is to puncture the fantasy that "everyone" is watching something only a few people are
