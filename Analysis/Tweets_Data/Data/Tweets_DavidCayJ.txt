DavidCayJ	717151478100729856	2016-04-05T00:46:51	Made all three network news shows tonight. I've been on this for 40 years. More soon. 
DavidCayJ	717151132020318209	2016-04-05T00:45:28	I have not blocked anybody. Not my nature. 
DavidCayJ	717128581613273088	2016-04-04T23:15:52	Readers/viewers need to press the press to get back some spine. They hear being 2 tuff; trust me, absurd as that is 
DavidCayJ	717127963045720064	2016-04-04T23:13:24	Our Congress acts when we demand - Not power onto itself. SBAnthoby, FDouglass, MLK showed way. Make govt acctable 
DavidCayJ	717126903249903617	2016-04-04T23:09:11	Valid issue but I'm dealing w/ latest column. Not  w/ my Trump exposes,  either. 1 issue per piece.  
DavidCayJ	717126133758689280	2016-04-04T23:06:08	Be informed. Insist ALL candidates disclose. Ask Cong to mandate disclosure, etc.  
DavidCayJ	717125516277452801	2016-04-04T23:03:41	Be informed. Insist all candidates disclose fully.  
DavidCayJ	717125377211166721	2016-04-04T23:03:08	No. But Sanders knows Nixon/Agnew &amp; says he's for transparency. His conduct makes holding back easier.  
DavidCayJ	717122504578506752	2016-04-04T22:51:43	ACA not an issue in this; integrity in WH, disclosure standards  &amp; Bernie judgment on issue he knew would arise are 
DavidCayJ	717121240180342785	2016-04-04T22:46:41	Now you join Trump in just making stuff up while ignoring actual issues.  
DavidCayJ	717110801040084992	2016-04-04T22:05:12	Also read my AJAM column on gratuitous threat to Indian Point safety via huge pipeline a few feet away  
DavidCayJ	717110356288610304	2016-04-04T22:03:26	Wrong again. Please read my column.  It's on issues, central to our republic always.  
DavidCayJ	717109528442105856	2016-04-04T22:00:09	R u a 1-issue voter? Or want rounded info? Have u read my column?  
DavidCayJ	717101233518022657	2016-04-04T21:27:11	Read my column. You are imagining not  learning.  
DavidCayJ	717101029305794560	2016-04-04T21:26:23	Again you miss point completely. Bernie us helping Trump, Kasich, Cruz &amp; future Cheneys.  
DavidCayJ	717098908799905793	2016-04-04T21:17:57	No you did not see his 2014 tax return. You saw Form 1040. That's not a tax return it's a summary.  
DavidCayJ	717098452694372352	2016-04-04T21:16:08	You are completely missing the point. Not what you imagine. Please read 1st, then Tweet 
DavidCayJ	717097621739937793	2016-04-04T21:12:50	Read my column to see reasons this is important. NationalMemo 
DavidCayJ	717097323868852224	2016-04-04T21:11:39	Mortgages not in Senate fin disclosures until Bernie filed numerous amendments, all in my column

DavidCayJ	717013882464780289	2016-04-04T15:40:05	LizMednick sunnysingh_nw3 You really miss the points: candor, WH crooks, poor issue mgment, aid to Trump/Cruz/Kasich, etc.
DavidCayJ	717013399968882689	2016-04-04T15:38:10	You miss  pt -- WaPo Bernie asked for returns a long time ago &amp; as he knew this would come up, failed to prepare. 
DavidCayJ	716913535201255424	2016-04-04T09:01:21	Read carefully - only Form 1040 &amp; state equivalent, WaPo notes, not tax return, which is full filing 
DavidCayJ	716912954231402496	2016-04-04T08:59:02	obbiecole Fools, idiots &amp; zealots belive crazy things. Tax deniers sed IRS paid me; disgraced author wrote drug cartels paid me, etc.

DavidCayJ	716887309963161600	2016-04-04T07:17:08	Interesting graphic but what is source -- to verify?  
DavidCayJ	716835954573574145	2016-04-04T03:53:04	Not likely. My Reuters columns then explained; similar to why Trump will never release   
DavidCayJ	716835139318366208	2016-04-04T03:49:50	Which I was writing about MANY years before it became popular issue.., 
DavidCayJ	716834209407639557	2016-04-04T03:46:08	You think judgment in this not relevant?  
DavidCayJ	716832428443242496	2016-04-04T03:39:03	Wrong. Used to be standard. Cheney only some years. Romney not, for reasons I explained  in 2012. All should.  
DavidCayJ	716831478588522497	2016-04-04T03:35:17	2/ political donations NOT tax deductible so not on tax returns  
DavidCayJ	716831321201500161	2016-04-04T03:34:39	1/ Sanders is a democratic socialist; means market economics w/rules to control predators; strong safety net;   
DavidCayJ	716829598756028416	2016-04-04T03:27:49	No idea &amp; not affect my work. Like every place since 19 (except Philly Inky) they came to me.   
DavidCayJ	716828960995336192	2016-04-04T03:25:16	Wrong. Newt, GWB... Go to tax  
DavidCayJ	716828484274884609	2016-04-04T03:23:23	Goes to Bernie's judgment. He knew this would come up so why not meet high standard? Why like Cruz/Kasich? 
DavidCayJ	716827441050812417	2016-04-04T03:19:14	Why? He should've  put them out last summer. Bernie around for Nixon/Agnew, knows the drill.  
DavidCayJ	716825398911352833	2016-04-04T03:11:07	Probably but w/o returns no way to tell. If nothing there why not release? Bernie was around for Nixon/Agnew... 
DavidCayJ	716822387086516225	2016-04-04T02:59:09	Not at all. Think Teddy Roosevelt, FDR or poor boy/rich man LBJ or ~1%er me who remembers where I came from. 
DavidCayJ	716821010738253824	2016-04-04T02:53:41	Thank you for explaining.

DavidCayJ	716819062551158784	2016-04-04T02:45:57	Low on Senate wealth ladder, but irrelevant to point if my column.  
DavidCayJ	716818736133615616	2016-04-04T02:44:39	I invite criticism; push back when people comment w/o reading, get facts wrong or make stuff up. That's debate.  
DavidCayJ	716815876784320512	2016-04-04T02:33:17	HRC had nothing to do with my column. Never spoken to her or her campaign. I do my own work.  
DavidCayJ	716814458887258112	2016-04-04T02:27:39	Exposed what? Holding all pols to same standard?

DavidCayJ	711558875468734464	2016-03-20T14:23:50	RADIOPLUG1: What might be lurking in Trump's tax returns? David Cay Johnston has some ideas.  DavidCayJ
DavidCayJ	711190145651777536	2016-03-19T13:58:38	Right! Dearth of pro reporting, espec beats = fading accountability 4 Gov, Biz &amp; Nonprofits. Kleptos ❤️ it.

DavidCayJ	710958672277405696	2016-03-18T22:38:51	Threats against realDonaldTrump are reprehensible. We ALL need to denounce, urge civil debate.
DavidCayJ	710958081442643968	2016-03-18T22:36:30	Underfunding public defenders is not justice; too many guilty get away while too many innocent get  jail

DavidCayJ	709968481526136832	2016-03-16T05:04:11	LiberalBadIdeas I responded to your assertion story not covered. Evidently that is not so. Lead is awful. factsmatter
DavidCayJ	709965644184297472	2016-03-16T04:52:54	Well you're changing the subject, as tweeted earlier, that's a good point. 
DavidCayJ	709965014711586816	2016-03-16T04:50:24	You mischaracterize. Nuance matters.  
DavidCayJ	709964790215606272	2016-03-16T04:49:31	And yet I never denied there was a connection… 
DavidCayJ	709964693708865536	2016-03-16T04:49:08	Of course tax rate cuts are central to our dangerous infrastructure – it's in my books &amp; 100s of articles 
DavidCayJ	709964318100615168	2016-03-16T04:47:38	That is dissing. Lets elevate quality of debate via engagement  
DavidCayJ	709963686669111296	2016-03-16T04:45:08	To clarify, I don't think I'm digging a hole deeper. I think this is engaging &amp; encouraging thoughtfulness 
DavidCayJ	709963281277067265	2016-03-16T04:43:31	So, again, LiberalBadIdeas what say you about your claim story ignored?  
DavidCayJ	709963007078563841	2016-03-16T04:42:26	I never said he was moderate.  
DavidCayJ	709962872412119040	2016-03-16T04:41:53	Huh? I didn't diss anyone. I wrote  we should engage w/ others... 
DavidCayJ	709962182344253440	2016-03-16T04:39:09	Great to know. What say LiberalBadIdeas ? 
DavidCayJ	709961859315712004	2016-03-16T04:37:52	I think it's better to engage with people then dismiss or ignore them. Opinions about that approach vary 
DavidCayJ	709961360411643905	2016-03-16T04:35:53	My Google  search showed 3; glad more.  
DavidCayJ	709961104789782528	2016-03-16T04:34:52	I think engaging people is what we all should be doing - not dissing, shaming or ignoring.  
DavidCayJ	709960478143991808	2016-03-16T04:32:23	Now you're changing the subject… 
DavidCayJ	709960271738093575	2016-03-16T04:31:33	Does anyone here get the difference between defending &amp; explaining? Between choosing among disliked options? 
DavidCayJ	709960027239530498	2016-03-16T04:30:35	I never said what you wrote below. I wrote the exact opposite.  
DavidCayJ	709959706152996864	2016-03-16T04:29:19	Cuz the D might lose?  
DavidCayJ	709959280322093056	2016-03-16T04:27:37	Thank you fir YouTube song.  
DavidCayJ	709958924242448388	2016-03-16T04:26:12	2. Because we live in an imperfect world. In a democracy you have to persuade people or suffer THEIR choices 
DavidCayJ	709958562806669315	2016-03-16T04:24:46	1. You keep trying to create an issue where none exists. I'm 100% choice.  
DavidCayJ	709958250834354176	2016-03-16T04:23:32	Strange how those with such attitudes are often men who  participate. willfulblindness 
DavidCayJ	709957698624884737	2016-03-16T04:21:20	To be clear, I didn't write that, I criticized it. And I think you mean birth not birch  
DavidCayJ	709957378729443329	2016-03-16T04:20:04	ANY 1 issue voting indicates zealotry. We should weigh (often bad) options. See new thought experiment. 
DavidCayJ	709956400676474880	2016-03-16T04:16:10	Again, I never even hinted they are. Please read w/ care.  
DavidCayJ	709956068969992193	2016-03-16T04:14:51	Choose most/least among GOP 3, please. Look at all issues not one.  
DavidCayJ	709955678836809728	2016-03-16T04:13:18	Do you try reading when I actually wrote rather than what you imagine… Please. About 20 Tweets u can read.  
DavidCayJ	709955407163293696	2016-03-16T04:12:14	One of the reasons I just made a multi year &amp; big - for me - pledge to PP.  
DavidCayJ	709955012915568640	2016-03-16T04:10:40	How did you miss my repeatedly stating exactly that?  
DavidCayJ	709954874453139458	2016-03-16T04:10:07	Writing about something once or a few times is not covering – this should be a continuing story with major play 
DavidCayJ	709954686548361218	2016-03-16T04:09:22	Below is offensive misogynist nonsense.   
DavidCayJ	709954417437622272	2016-03-16T04:08:18	Again, read my ~12 Tweets; repro rights BIG, but not only, issue. See new thot experiment.  
DavidCayJ	709953922836930560	2016-03-16T04:06:20	If you read my writing about decades of wrongdoing by GS? 
DavidCayJ	709953716623908869	2016-03-16T04:05:31	Thought experiment; 100% right to choose, but Prexy builds walls, invades Syria; spies on prayers; ends Medicare; closes EPA &amp; OSHA. Ponder.
DavidCayJ	709951993780035589	2016-03-16T03:58:40	Seriously, go read what I actually wrote with care, please. I've done about a dozen tweets now… 
DavidCayJ	709951837244432384	2016-03-16T03:58:02	You make a giant, fact-free leap below; come to absurd, false observation.  
DavidCayJ	709951411388354560	2016-03-16T03:56:21	I spend a lot more than 5 mins + a lot of $ on repro rights; my point was about 1 issue voters.  
DavidCayJ	709950617167462400	2016-03-16T03:53:12	Primary does not equal one. Get a dictionary, please.  
DavidCayJ	709950326112124928	2016-03-16T03:52:02	Sam, what makes you think I want to punch Russia? Did Martians take over your account? 
DavidCayJ	709950062986715136	2016-03-16T03:50:59	I asked 50+ Cong Dems about Kasich; all dislike views but respect competence &amp; integrity.  
DavidCayJ	709949246477361153	2016-03-16T03:47:45	Try nuance. Kasich expanded Medicare, nit urge violence, walls, etc. Walks his consistent talk.  
DavidCayJ	709948376528195584	2016-03-16T03:44:17	You must have misread then.  
DavidCayJ	709947830903840768	2016-03-16T03:42:07	Yes and that contradicts their stated claim of promoting liberty. But it's not the only issue. 
DavidCayJ	709947653874851840	2016-03-16T03:41:25	You missed I said women should have right to choose; I donate to PP. Read w/ care, please  
DavidCayJ	709947195470909440	2016-03-16T03:39:36	Cuz u disagree on 1 issue does not vitiate my point. Every pro Dem I asked (50+) respects him, not Trump or Cruz 
DavidCayJ	709946384464482304	2016-03-16T03:36:22	Thank u; Twitter NOT  good for nuance. BTW, just made a PP multi year pledge... 
DavidCayJ	709945867139088384	2016-03-16T03:34:19	Cruz anti even when rape; Kasich 4 rape exception; Trump fudges. Disagree w/ all 3, but they not identical positions 
DavidCayJ	709944466954592256	2016-03-16T03:28:45	Sorry, but you are wrong. See my thought experiment Tweet.  
DavidCayJ	709944154139131904	2016-03-16T03:27:31	bchek833 a question Is never wrong; moments  later I Tweeted Bernie was in fact ignored...
DavidCayJ	709943611744329729	2016-03-16T03:25:21	Did I miss something – Cruz and Trump didn't appear to say anything new either; HRC partly new stump speech  
DavidCayJ	709943065272684544	2016-03-16T03:23:11	Thought experiment for 1 issue voters: you must choose as Prexy Cruz, Kasich or Trump. Stick to rule
DavidCayJ	709942366128381955	2016-03-16T03:20:24	Again, please read carefully. Was about lead, widespread problem, not right to control own body.  
DavidCayJ	709941979707154432	2016-03-16T03:18:52	Issue was lead in water, not freedom to choose about own body; read carefully please 
DavidCayJ	709940517157515264	2016-03-16T03:13:04	You misread 
DavidCayJ	709940322759913473	2016-03-16T03:12:17	Then organize to expand Roe; freedom side losing ground; anti winning cuz organize, work w/focus &amp; bug campaign $ 
DavidCayJ	709937699646345216	2016-03-16T03:01:52	Neither Trump or Cruz said anything new, but cable ran them.  
DavidCayJ	709936227667980288	2016-03-16T02:56:01	Good point. Bernie ignored again by the "liberal" news media.  
DavidCayJ	709935483879596032	2016-03-16T02:53:03	Has Bernie spoken yet? 
DavidCayJ	709935362144124928	2016-03-16T02:52:34	.princeeditor asks, What if journalists if color ran campaign coverage? 
DavidCayJ	709933313914507264	2016-03-16T02:44:26	Women should control their bodies; but 1 issue does not politics make -- except for zealots  
DavidCayJ	709931817256800256	2016-03-16T02:38:29	Civility ≠ false equivalency.  
DavidCayJ	709924588776509442	2016-03-16T02:09:46	Vets treated badly, says Trump - who cut VA budget? Who sent soldiers to unnecessary war w/ bad safety gear?
DavidCayJ	709923915003523072	2016-03-16T02:07:05	Many cities suffer w/ lead; disregard widespread, not unique to Kasich. Rare in rich white suburbs, not unknown.  
DavidCayJ	709922897226240001	2016-03-16T02:03:03	Nothing new 2nite from realDonaldTrump who opens w/ Northern Marianas, says "if" wins; low energy
DavidCayJ	709922171020247042	2016-03-16T02:00:09	Ask Plain Dealer, local TV, public radio why not MORE coverage. Picket PeeDee maybe.  
DavidCayJ	709919855827226624	2016-03-16T01:50:57	Agreed.   
DavidCayJ	709919600054415360	2016-03-16T01:49:56	Absolutely true; also expanded Medicaid, embraced ACA.  Be civil, respectful; avoid Trumpism. 
DavidCayJ	709919032867049473	2016-03-16T01:47:41	"Winner" realDonaldTrump never gets GOP majority; Illinois &amp; NC 60% for others; Fla 54% others; MO 57% others.
DavidCayJ	709917190221373440	2016-03-16T01:40:22	You don't have to agree with someone on any issue to recognize dignity &amp; principle; contrast JohnKasich w/DJT  
DavidCayJ	709916573469974528	2016-03-16T01:37:55	Conservative ≠ evil. Respect people you disagree with when they are principled. Expect same from others.  
DavidCayJ	709914305915920384	2016-03-16T01:28:54	Will GOP turn to competent, decent JohnKasich in July -- or in 2020? 2024?
DavidCayJ	709912678161059841	2016-03-16T01:22:26	HRC gave her best speech 2nite. Made pts clearly &amp; w/o rancor swiped at DJT, Bernie, appeal to our best. Kasich gentlemanly &amp; competent.
