amandacarpenter	726120403538612225	2016-04-29T18:46:09	The Russians are mocking us on an almost daily basis. And Trump wants to be buddies.
amandacarpenter	726120030837063681	2016-04-29T18:44:40	First on CNN: Russians 'barrel roll' over another U.S. Air Force plane  
amandacarpenter	726083550198386691	2016-04-29T16:19:43	Kirk4Defiance I hear ya
amandacarpenter	726082543741591555	2016-04-29T16:15:43	Fun story. Mike Pence's folks were the first real actual Republicans to reach out to me when I was doing my college activism at Ball State
amandacarpenter	726082359716532224	2016-04-29T16:14:59	I miss Mike Pence.
amandacarpenter	726075763733106688	2016-04-29T15:48:46	Holly10410 Thanks--very kind of you. As always, there are far more good people (like you!) than bad when it comes to this type of thing :)
amandacarpenter	726072871005511680	2016-04-29T15:37:16	Not happening. I'm going to do what I have always done. Support clear, principled conservative values.  
amandacarpenter	726068562599665664	2016-04-29T15:20:09	Sigh. The lesson Ted Cruz still hasn't learned. From me CR 
amandacarpenter	725835170801025026	2016-04-28T23:52:44	An uncharacteristically agitated Mike Lee calls in to Mark Levin's show to rail against Boehner over Cruz comments: 
amandacarpenter	725835723648069632	2016-04-28T23:54:56	Mike Lee: "I've had it. I've absolutely had it. It is time for us to expose people like John Boehner." 
amandacarpenter	725714386996834310	2016-04-28T15:52:47	BINGO 
amandacarpenter	725714230335430656	2016-04-28T15:52:10	I'm glad everyone can see what we were dealing w/ when Boehner was Speaker now. Everyone can see true colors.  
amandacarpenter	725711443623075840	2016-04-28T15:41:05	Paul Ryan touts Congress' recent accomplishments.  Can't help but notice that nothing he mentioned has been accomplished this year...
amandacarpenter	725699991130492928	2016-04-28T14:55:35	All that said, I've always hated the SOB expression. Why bring someone's mother into it? It's just a bad expression.
amandacarpenter	725699403458174977	2016-04-28T14:53:15	But if he wasn't maybe someone should offer him a glass and ask him how he REALLY feels about Ted Cruz. Can we livestream that? drinkswJohn
amandacarpenter	725699087916486657	2016-04-28T14:52:00	If you told me Boehner was into his 2nd bottle of red when he made the Lucifer comment I'd forgive him pretty quick. He's retired after all
amandacarpenter	725474317325225989	2016-04-27T23:58:50	Listened to Trump's rally speech. Notably absent: any attacks against Carly. Scared?
amandacarpenter	725438668161179648	2016-04-27T21:37:11	If ever there was a piece that perfectly sums up Trump's candidacy, this is it. Well done amandacarpenter 
amandacarpenter	725403474985263104	2016-04-27T19:17:20	I'll be joining jaketapper on TheLeadCNN in the 4pm hour. :)
amandacarpenter	725382362570301444	2016-04-27T17:53:26	Critical that GOP women stand up to Trump and say, no, this isn't how men in our party can treat us. No sir. Thank you Carly!
amandacarpenter	725382037331386368	2016-04-27T17:52:09	So many other Republicans have surrendered to the idea of Trump. She wouldn't. Thank you Carly!!!
amandacarpenter	725381741737828353	2016-04-27T17:50:58	Props to Carly. She stepped up, has been campaigning hard to stop Trump instead of going into hiding like other candidates. She's a fighter

amandacarpenter	725312335473156096	2016-04-27T13:15:11	Trump is just another liberal Republican. I'll treat him just like all of the other RINOs we've come across.  
amandacarpenter	725311191355109380	2016-04-27T13:10:38	SteveDeaceShow Thanks, Steve.

amandacarpenter	725310279224057856	2016-04-27T13:07:00	"I can't tell you what I'm going to do because I don't know."-The most honest thing Trump has said in a long time.
amandacarpenter	725309677790199808	2016-04-27T13:04:37	I would crack a joke about Trump and his surrogates being low-energy today but I think they are just hungover.
amandacarpenter	725305535906611200	2016-04-27T12:48:09	A campaign devoid of policy is wholly driven by personality. The cult of Trump. - See more at: 
amandacarpenter	725304569786470400	2016-04-27T12:44:19	No. I'm not the reason. Really. He's so big and amazing and powerful, like you all say. He doesn't need me.  
amandacarpenter	725303589728575489	2016-04-27T12:40:25	Trump is far more comfortable appeasing the transgender bathroom lobby than attempting to unify the different wings of the GOP.
amandacarpenter	725303341673287681	2016-04-27T12:39:26	President Trump won’t be much like Ronald Reagan; he would probably be a lot more like Lyndon Johnson. From me CR 
amandacarpenter	725303009496944646	2016-04-27T12:38:07	Conservatives don't need to help Trump. He doesn't want to win with them in his coalition anyway. From me at CR 
amandacarpenter	725301377354858496	2016-04-27T12:31:38	For a party that pretended to stand for freedom &amp; pluralism, this is an ironic and dispiriting impasse. 
amandacarpenter	725109914658545664	2016-04-26T23:50:50	
amandacarpenter	724961917991682048	2016-04-26T14:02:45	This whole idea still seems silly to me. 
amandacarpenter	723553353850986497	2016-04-22T16:45:37	"The fitting unity ticket would never be Trump-Cruz. It would be Clinton-Trump." Well said, amandacarpenter 
amandacarpenter	723541966256893952	2016-04-22T16:00:22	Trump May Be an Outsider, But He’s Still a Squish says amandacarpenter   . 
amandacarpenter	722791692160671744	2016-04-20T14:19:02	I'll be on CNN with JohnBerman and KateBolduan in the 11am hour
amandacarpenter	722615709063360512	2016-04-20T02:39:45	Just stylistically speaking, judging Trump's speech versus Clinton's is like Bad News Bears versus New York Yankees.
amandacarpenter	722601887871156229	2016-04-20T01:44:50	I expect Hillary's victory speech will be quite a contrast to Trump's. Entry level versus seasoned professional.
amandacarpenter	722601457166479360	2016-04-20T01:43:07	Trump's shortest speech ever?

amandacarpenter	720947881583243266	2016-04-15T12:12:24	I owe a lot to rupertmurdoch. But the normalization of Trump by Fox/NYPost/WSJ is a disservice to his legacy and the country he loves.

amandacarpenter	720789473458589696	2016-04-15T01:42:56	Democrats are having a substantive, exciting, necessary debate on the issues. Why won't Trump agree to let the GOP do the  same? CNNDebate

amandacarpenter	720447891895119872	2016-04-14T03:05:37	That's of course a joke. But a wonderful event. CNN's family town halls were great all around. So refreshing.
amandacarpenter	720447754791751680	2016-04-14T03:05:04	Consensus is Heidi Cruz killed it in the CNN family town hall. Can "Cruz for President" mean Heidi Cruz? Secret convention white knight?

amandacarpenter	719941882164469760	2016-04-12T17:34:55	It would be nice if those who talk about Cruz's "New York values" attack considered the origins of it. From me cr 
amandacarpenter	719917923708436480	2016-04-12T15:59:43	The easiest way for Ryan to rule out a bid would be to endorse someone but needing to run the convention impartially nixes that.
amandacarpenter	719917117324197888	2016-04-12T15:56:30	Quit asking Paul Ryan if he is running for President. Ask him what he's doing right now as Speaker.

amandacarpenter	717554323866030081	2016-04-06T03:27:36	How is it that Trump projects "strength" when he constantly threatens lawsuits, accuses others of crimes and actually does nothing about it?
amandacarpenter	717553917140213761	2016-04-06T03:26:00	More bluster. 
amandacarpenter	717548434610204672	2016-04-06T03:04:12	This is a classy statement to issue in the face of a loss. Compare and contrast to Trump. 
amandacarpenter	717547888318885888	2016-04-06T03:02:02	I figured it out. Sarah Palin wrote Trump's statement tonight.
amandacarpenter	717547267431878656	2016-04-06T02:59:34	So what was Donald's "big surprise"?

amandacarpenter	705584528295903233	2016-03-04T02:43:55	Good question for the crowd. I was a waitress, too!
amandacarpenter	705583462581981184	2016-03-04T02:39:41	Is there any reporter arguing that Trump should not release the NYT from their off/record agreement out of respect for them?
amandacarpenter	705581881891397633	2016-03-04T02:33:24	Trump: "No, it's OK because I was just paying off liberals so that I could enrich myself!" Oh OK, well that's fine then. GOPDebate
amandacarpenter	705583127947669504	2016-03-04T02:38:21	Trump won't release the tape, won't release his tax returns. He doesn't want voters to know.
amandacarpenter	705580152764416004	2016-03-04T02:26:32	Caitlin! CNN is killing it w/ conservative women on air. amandacarpenter secupp mkhammer 
amandacarpenter	705582121990000640	2016-03-04T02:34:21	Trump acts like going off the record reporters is for their benefit. "I will always honor it."Believe me, the reporters prefer on the record
amandacarpenter	705582132547219456	2016-03-04T02:34:24	Trump basically admits it
amandacarpenter	705582133939539969	2016-03-04T02:34:24	Trump echoes Obama: I will have flexibility after the election.

amandacarpenter	705579241451216896	2016-03-04T02:22:54	Make no mistake. Trump will treat you the way he treats Marco if you don't, let's say, get on your knees. NeverTrump
amandacarpenter	705577578715742208	2016-03-04T02:16:18	Kasich has assumed the Carson position, complaining about time, wasting the time he gets.
amandacarpenter	705558370300862464	2016-03-04T00:59:58	I'm on AC360 in this hour and back at 11!
amandacarpenter	705476344667312129	2016-03-03T19:34:02	Trump on Celebrity Apprentice ... "dropping to your knees" .. 
amandacarpenter	705475643476189184	2016-03-03T19:31:15	Trump: “A lot of people don’t sue me because they say it’s so hard.” If you are this person, please give me a call.
amandacarpenter	705475313199808512	2016-03-03T19:29:56	It doesn't matter if Trump meant "on your knees" as begging and not oral sex. A President must be precise w/ his language.
amandacarpenter	705474303043604480	2016-03-03T19:25:55	The guy who talks about Mitt Romney being "on his knees" is DEFINITELY who should campaign against Hillary. Sure. Sure. Kill me now.
amandacarpenter	705473997039751168	2016-03-03T19:24:42	How many people want to defend a presidential candidate making oral sex jokes in a general election. Anyone..?! Against Hillary Clinton...?
amandacarpenter	705473510144016384	2016-03-03T19:22:46	Trump is doing *exactly* what Romney predicted he would.
amandacarpenter	705471481828868096	2016-03-03T19:14:42	"Trump Time:" The mins you have to add to the start of his speech to account for time needed to throw people he doesn't like out of the room
amandacarpenter	705469199750017025	2016-03-03T19:05:38	The numbers are the numbers.  
amandacarpenter	705468320963649537	2016-03-03T19:02:09	Lots of 'mo behind the idea of "Never Trump." But if not Trump, who? Trump has 319 delegates. Cruz has 226. This isn't hard to figure out
amandacarpenter	705416126856036352	2016-03-03T15:34:45	This photo of Trump Jr holding a bloody piece of dismembered elephant may be the best accidental metaphor ever. 
amandacarpenter	705454643091009536	2016-03-03T18:07:48	Kasich on lack of media attention for his campaign: "You don’t even put me in the stories anymore"
amandacarpenter	705446045367468032	2016-03-03T17:33:38	Seems like a big deal. 
amandacarpenter	705441103617642498	2016-03-03T17:14:00	Here's Mitt Romney's takedown of Trump, full text: 
amandacarpenter	705441594518872065	2016-03-03T17:15:57	That's really it. Trump is a "bad influence." If he were a kid in high school, I wouldn't let my kids hang out with him.
amandacarpenter	705441387194351617	2016-03-03T17:15:07	"Little Marco." It is sick how people are adopting Trump's crude language. He's a bad influence on our country. 
amandacarpenter	705440814990794756	2016-03-03T17:12:51	We don't. 
amandacarpenter	705440416594694144	2016-03-03T17:11:16	I can pretty confidently predict whether someone is a Trump supporter or not with the use of vulgar terms he/she directs at me.
amandacarpenter	705440150696759296	2016-03-03T17:10:13	Feel like I've been on the Internet a while &amp; I've never been regularly attacked with sexist and gross terms as I've been with Trump ppl
amandacarpenter	705439813114003456	2016-03-03T17:08:52	Oh, ok. That makes a such a big difference. Sure. 
amandacarpenter	705439424042012672	2016-03-03T17:07:19	Yep. We will never forget how you called him a child molester.  
amandacarpenter	705438003208933377	2016-03-03T17:01:41	Trump channeles that anger at anyone or anything in his way. Cruz channels it at Washington, pushing for change there.
amandacarpenter	705437830919532544	2016-03-03T17:00:59	I've talked about this a few times on CNN. Candidates can't ignore the voter anger, but it matters where you direct it
amandacarpenter	705437713902600192	2016-03-03T17:00:32	I loved Romney's remarks about how voter anger is channeled.
amandacarpenter	705436121514115072	2016-03-03T16:54:12	Trump supporter on CNN says Romney's speech was a play to "steal the nomination." Um, he hasn't won it!
amandacarpenter	705433127238262784	2016-03-03T16:42:18	It is incredibly helpful that Romney is stepping up to be an attack dog the day of a debate
amandacarpenter	705432944404369408	2016-03-03T16:41:34	Mitt Romney is doing a great service for Cruz and Rubio today--putting it all out there so they don't get bogged down with this.
amandacarpenter	705432765018181632	2016-03-03T16:40:52	"Evil trumping good"
amandacarpenter	705432296942227456	2016-03-03T16:39:00	So true. 
amandacarpenter	705431866254315521	2016-03-03T16:37:17	Shorter Romney: I'm better at business than you, Trumpster.
amandacarpenter	705431713271250944	2016-03-03T16:36:41	Yes, thank you Romney for reminding that Trump is too cowardly to touch entitlements. Remember that, Chris Christie?!
amandacarpenter	705431427681120256	2016-03-03T16:35:33	Yes, it's a little stiff. Scripted. But, it's respectful.
amandacarpenter	705431354234671104	2016-03-03T16:35:15	Listening to Romney speak we are reminded a bit of what a presidential candidate should sound like. NeverTrump
amandacarpenter	705427880226983937	2016-03-03T16:21:27	New Jersey's largest newspaper--the Newark Star-Ledger--joins six other papers in calling on Christie to resign 
amandacarpenter	705428095101042689	2016-03-03T16:22:18	Of course. Trump is the big threat.  
amandacarpenter	705427023192133632	2016-03-03T16:18:03	Give it up for Romney for speaking out to stop what he feels is wrong. Where is everyone else? NeverTrump
amandacarpenter	705426864987213824	2016-03-03T16:17:25	And, you have to admit, Romney is showing some good backbone doing this. I like seeing ppl go out on a limb.
amandacarpenter	705426644521996288	2016-03-03T16:16:32	I know a lot of people are dismissing Romney's speech but I do care what he has to say. Millions of GOP voted for him, sheesh.
amandacarpenter	705411265338986496	2016-03-03T15:15:26	Before he railed about jobs going overseas, Trump defended the practice as good for business

amandacarpenter	705194382907998213	2016-03-03T00:53:37	Yeah, I am still kinda stunned. :) 
amandacarpenter	705165296261316608	2016-03-02T22:58:02	If Rubio were in Cruz's position of delegates and cash, i guarantee you Cruz and Kasich would have been out by close of business today
amandacarpenter	705192425686323200	2016-03-03T00:45:50	You have a candidate on Trump's very heels who can win if people would only wake up and see the treasure in front of them.

amandacarpenter	705005588212817920	2016-03-02T12:23:25	Just weeks ago Graham was running around trashing Cruz to anyone who would listen. Amazing development. 
amandacarpenter	705005048670113792	2016-03-02T12:21:16	Disturbing and gross.

amandacarpenter	700013429839544321	2016-02-17T17:46:21	Can't wait till Trump tells the IRS &amp; Department of Justice to silence those who hold him accountable. That'll be great for the free speech.
amandacarpenter	700012867714740224	2016-02-17T17:44:07	Trump also issues a cease and desist letter to the Club for Growth. Where did that complaint go? Nooooowhhheeerre.

amandacarpenter	699764363859771393	2016-02-17T01:16:39	I say this out of love. Marco Rubio is not going to elevate discourse or promote unity by parroting Trump's "liar" remarks.

amandacarpenter	699734955048435712	2016-02-16T23:19:48	The GOP field can beat Trump, but not as long as there are 6 people. So the field needs to thin quickly.. until then Trump is going to roll.
amandacarpenter	699733061567700992	2016-02-16T23:12:16	It doesn't have to be this way. I don't believe it's in Marco's heart, but he is doing it, perhaps goaded by consultants, nonetheless
amandacarpenter	699732473786318852	2016-02-16T23:09:56	Marco is probably the most negative campaigner in the race now. He has no wins. His optimistic attitude is evaporating as he mimics Trump.
amandacarpenter	699732037683539971	2016-02-16T23:08:12	I feel like Marco Rubio is the GOP primary's new Chris Christie. He only wants to damage Cruz and has no path to the nomination.

amandacarpenter	699701761246756864	2016-02-16T21:07:54	Think about it: Trump would rather hang out with Mika than Megyn Kelly. Speaks volumes.
amandacarpenter	699701619722575873	2016-02-16T21:07:20	Trump is not campaigning for the GOP nomination. He's campaigning to destroy the GOP. Look at who he is trying to appeal to.

amandacarpenter	699699336188329984	2016-02-16T20:58:16	So, Trump attributed a fake quote to Dr. Coburn that called Cruz a liar. One might call that...gee..what is the word? It starts with an L...

amandacarpenter	699639868004020225	2016-02-16T17:01:57	Gotta say, I don't have much patience left for Rubio ranting "liar liar" at Cruz while ignoring Trump who is the real threat to the GOP.
amandacarpenter	699639292243480576	2016-02-16T16:59:40	For all those who are yelling at me that Cruz hasn't attacked Trump enough, when has Marco Rubio ever laid a glove on him?

amandacarpenter	699599473366986753	2016-02-16T14:21:27	Had GOP engaged in "Oh, let's see who the nom is" we'd be toast. GOP wins when unafraid to fight HARD, make strong, clear positions known
amandacarpenter	699599126061838337	2016-02-16T14:20:04	Because Republicans outright rejected a 2016 SCOTUS nom, the media is saying "Who would want the nomination." Principles matter.

amandacarpenter	699591923292639232	2016-02-16T13:51:26	I get that Trump's supporters may not care he flip flops around on important issues but the media should.
amandacarpenter	699590986620653568	2016-02-16T13:47:43	Trump: DACA "is great" Oh, he doesn't support it. He'll sue Cruz. Maybe not. Bush lied. Well, he doesn't know. This is crap ppl.
amandacarpenter	699589990301483009	2016-02-16T13:43:46	That's not "softening tone." That's another sign of an incoherent blowhard who can't keep this thoughts straight.

amandacarpenter	699339372785590272	2016-02-15T21:07:54	Saying DACA "is great" is pretty declarative. Let Trump explain what he meant and how, exactly, he would handle the policy.
amandacarpenter	699339097211428864	2016-02-15T21:06:48	Don't let a spox walk it back for him. He probably doesn't know what it is.

amandacarpenter	699338029740109826	2016-02-15T21:02:34	Trump is for touchback amnesty and Obama's executive-order issued DACA amnesty. Let's talk about issues; not insults.
amandacarpenter	699336178718277632	2016-02-15T20:55:12	People defending Trump say he might now know what DACA is. Well, he certainly won't stop Obama's amnesty if he doesn't even know what it is!
amandacarpenter	699335762316124161	2016-02-15T20:53:33	Everyone going crazy over the threat of Trump's conspiracy birther suit missed the story. Trump supports Obama's DACA amnesty!
amandacarpenter	699335371931267072	2016-02-15T20:52:00	Ted Cruz says he will rescind DACA. Trump says "it's great."
amandacarpenter	699335211692068864	2016-02-15T20:51:22	Donald Trump is supposed to be the immigration candidate, but he's completely supportive of Obama's unilateral DACA amnesty. "It's great."
amandacarpenter	699335028656857088	2016-02-15T20:50:38	Got that? Trump thinks Obama's Amnesty is "great." This is what happens when ppl ask him about issues.  
amandacarpenter	699328764669333504	2016-02-15T20:25:45	Trump is literally blackmailing his opponent. But remember, Ted Cruz is the "nasty" one. 
amandacarpenter	699324597112418304	2016-02-15T20:09:11	It was not amazing. It was unhinged.

amandacarpenter	699318690001457152	2016-02-15T19:45:43	Trump suggests USA is losing 19-0 against terrorists. What a great moral leader.
amandacarpenter	699318157995945984	2016-02-15T19:43:36	Trump focuses almost only on Cruz and Jeb. Not Rubio. That's who he views as his competition in SC.
amandacarpenter	699316743487926272	2016-02-15T19:37:58	I can tell you what Trump's litmus test for SCOTUS would be: complete allegiance to Trump; screw the Constitution.
amandacarpenter	699316550403170304	2016-02-15T19:37:12	Trump wasn't threatening a lawsuit against Cruz in NH. Only IA and SC, where Cruz threatens him. Trump's view of the courts is sick
amandacarpenter	699315818165764096	2016-02-15T19:34:18	Parroting Trump talking points is basically like taking cues from Media Matters. 
amandacarpenter	699315504658288640	2016-02-15T19:33:03	What court is going to say, "Why yes Donald, I will settle this dispute because you are openly irritated about negative ads." Right.
amandacarpenter	699315120451637248	2016-02-15T19:31:32	How many lawsuits has Trump threatened against people this cycle over the fact he simply disagrees with them about something?
amandacarpenter	699313711698173952	2016-02-15T19:25:56	Trump loves using the court system for his personal gain. Ask him about the Supreme Court and the cases that hang in the balance.
amandacarpenter	699313587026685952	2016-02-15T19:25:26	Ask Trump what SCOTUS court cases he is following. Try it.
amandacarpenter	699313276811759616	2016-02-15T19:24:12	Anybody going to ask Trump about, dunno, his views on the Supreme Court decisions instead of doing his stenography today?
amandacarpenter	699312796496834561	2016-02-15T19:22:17	Trump complains about negative ads and says Cruz is unstable. Zero self-awareness.
amandacarpenter	699299982818594816	2016-02-15T18:31:22	To borrow a phrase, let's dispense with the fiction that Donald Trump doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing.
amandacarpenter	699299697702387712	2016-02-15T18:30:14	The last 7 months of our politics news cycles have been dominated by two words: "Trump says."

amandacarpenter	699254287797321728	2016-02-15T15:29:48	Marco keeps running away from his bill. Says Cruz supported it (um, no). Now it's he never wanted it to pass as is. He's not owning it.
amandacarpenter	699253941008109569	2016-02-15T15:28:25	The truth is, if Congress sent President Rubio another Go8 bill, as is, he wouldn't veto it. He'd sign it.
amandacarpenter	699253530281046017	2016-02-15T15:26:47	If Marco were right, the Gang would have accepted Ted's amendments to strip citizenship out of the bill. They didn't.
amandacarpenter	699253320779587584	2016-02-15T15:25:57	Let me explain why Marco is saying he thinks the House and Senate would have fixed Go8: He doesn't want to own that crapsandwich

amandacarpenter	698930922809397248	2016-02-14T18:04:52	McConnell must reconvene the Senate ASAP to block a SCOTUS recess appointment 
amandacarpenter	698929367745851392	2016-02-14T17:58:41	The Senate has complete and final discretion in whether to accept or approve a nomination. 
amandacarpenter	698929385739546625	2016-02-14T17:58:45	It's "Advise and consent." Not "advise and concede" as the Democrats are pretending.
amandacarpenter	698885546207277057	2016-02-14T15:04:33	Here is the notice showing inspection expiration for the elevator I was trapped inside. Thx Amtrak 
amandacarpenter	698885187522990081	2016-02-14T15:03:08	I'm finally out 
amandacarpenter	698871105105346562	2016-02-14T14:07:10	Guys. I'm trapped in an amtrak elevator at Bwi airport. Help?
amandacarpenter	698869033345667072	2016-02-14T13:58:56	Did you miss the part where Trump yelled "Bush lied!"...? Just a note from one bimbo to another, Ann. 
amandacarpenter	698861495338319872	2016-02-14T13:28:59	This morning, amandacarpenter writes that Sen. McConnell needs to be "boxed in" on blocking any Obama SCOTUS pick 
amandacarpenter	698859767595405313	2016-02-14T13:22:07	Credit to JohnKingCNN who just fact-checked Trump’s claim of being vocal critic before Iraq invasion. King says “no public record” of it.

amandacarpenter	698851861592412160	2016-02-14T12:50:42	.amandacarpenter is exactly right  
amandacarpenter	698850942205214721	2016-02-14T12:47:03	In the wake of Scalia’s death, candidates should speak frankly about their legal philosophy; it is their moral philosophy as well.
amandacarpenter	698850661723729920	2016-02-14T12:45:56	Dickerson was more interested in nitpicking Cruz than exploring the thoughts of the most accomplished legal mind on the stage
amandacarpenter	698850405854400513	2016-02-14T12:44:55	McConnell needs to be boxed in and the presidential candidates are in a position to do it.

amandacarpenter	698847224877330433	2016-02-14T12:32:17	The liberals have people like Gloria Steinem saying stupid things about young women. We have Ann Coulter. I'll ignore them both, thanks.
amandacarpenter	698847008962977792	2016-02-14T12:31:25	Coulter said women like me shouldn't vote. Maybe that's the reason why so many people don't listen to her anymore. Irrelevant.
amandacarpenter	698846804314460161	2016-02-14T12:30:36	BTW I did notice Ann Coulter called me a "bimbo" last night for being upset the candidates (Trump) were yelling so much.
amandacarpenter	698846101353287680	2016-02-14T12:27:49	This isn't a time that history should  repeat itself. 
amandacarpenter	698844547263045633	2016-02-14T12:21:38	They don't. Obama went around Congress too many times. Now the GOP can stop the Obama agenda in its tracks.  
amandacarpenter	698842945881903105	2016-02-14T12:15:16	During trying times Trump stood with Michael Moore and Nancy Pelosi. This is not OK. 
amandacarpenter	698755943530631168	2016-02-14T06:29:33	It is unreal how liberals believe Obama "has a right" to fill his vacancy. The Senate gets to decide who it is filled by. And when.
amandacarpenter	698753170739240960	2016-02-14T06:18:32	Block Obama's nom. Yes, things could be uncomfortable for a year. Better than losing the court for decades.
amandacarpenter	698748126560124928	2016-02-14T05:58:30	Obama won an election. GOP senators won elections. He can name whoever he wants to SCOTUS. They can withhold consent if they want. The end.

amandacarpenter	698713825483354113	2016-02-14T03:42:12	People who follow politics a lot are used to Trump's unhinged moments, but debate audiences haven't seen 2-hour meltdown like this.
amandacarpenter	698711772161818624	2016-02-14T03:34:02	So the moderator just begged GOP candidates to say something controversial.
amandacarpenter	698711262251843584	2016-02-14T03:32:01	But this debate is too much of a brawl because the moderators can't control it. At all.
amandacarpenter	698711134447210496	2016-02-14T03:31:30	No one else is confronting Donald Trump tonight as aggressively as Ted Cruz.
amandacarpenter	698710320026644480	2016-02-14T03:28:16	Bring it home, Ted!
amandacarpenter	698710097149698048	2016-02-14T03:27:23	Cruz takes it to Trump on his liberal record. Trump screams "nasty man!"
amandacarpenter	698709203544891394	2016-02-14T03:23:50	These. Are. Dumb. Questions.
amandacarpenter	698706273852919809	2016-02-14T03:12:11	When Marco lies about Cruz's record on amnesty, he's lying about what many conservatives worked to do, including me.
amandacarpenter	698706085365075968	2016-02-14T03:11:26	I want to support Marco on things where he is good, but it is infuriating to watch him lie about what Cruz did to stop Gang of 8.
amandacarpenter	698704822032338945	2016-02-14T03:06:25	Here's Rubio misconstruing the record for the millionth time.
amandacarpenter	698704090692526080	2016-02-14T03:03:31	Nice of CBS to flash Marco's talking points for him.
amandacarpenter	698702162495475712	2016-02-14T02:55:51	Which means the Senate may choose to decline a nominee. That's the process. Checks and balances. 
amandacarpenter	698701481634045952	2016-02-14T02:53:09	Did we want to see a debate between Jeb and Trump over George Bush with a side of Kasich? NO.
amandacarpenter	698701300234633216	2016-02-14T02:52:25	If this were the last big GOP public TV event before the SC primaries the voters in SC would be given a disservice.
amandacarpenter	698701045439012864	2016-02-14T02:51:25	I"m very happy Anderson Cooper is hosting GOP town halls this week because these moderators are taking this debate nowhere.
amandacarpenter	698699813488033794	2016-02-14T02:46:31	Pretty deliberate shot at Trump by Cruz.
amandacarpenter	698699551897755650	2016-02-14T02:45:29	Trump won't even say we need to raise the age of SS? What a copout.
amandacarpenter	698698022369259520	2016-02-14T02:39:24	I thought the GOP needed to look forward. Not go back and fight over Bush's mistakes. Oh, wait.
amandacarpenter	698697705628037121	2016-02-14T02:38:08	God, that was probably the worst debate exchange yet. Of all nine so far. Ugh.
amandacarpenter	698697388874145792	2016-02-14T02:36:53	Omg this is a brawl over the Bush Wars.
amandacarpenter	698697008035557376	2016-02-14T02:35:22	Trump was very comfortable with the 2006 Democrats who came into power trashing Bush.
amandacarpenter	698695782980046848	2016-02-14T02:30:30	CBS likes giving Cruz follow-ups. Others not so much..
amandacarpenter	698695246675365888	2016-02-14T02:28:22	We are still litigating Bush foreign policy. A major undercurrent in this election.
amandacarpenter	698694498478661633	2016-02-14T02:25:24	It's amazing how little time the frontrunners are getting in this debate so far.
amandacarpenter	698694051277701120	2016-02-14T02:23:37	Yes, but the nominating process started in 87. Wasn't a completely a lame duck event.

amandacarpenter	698691504584400896	2016-02-14T02:13:30	Why are we going to everyone EXCEPT the guy who as argued at SCOTUS? CruzCrew
amandacarpenter	698690962269347840	2016-02-14T02:11:21	This is where Rubio does the "let me tell you what I know" instead of what we should do talk.
amandacarpenter	698690782597877760	2016-02-14T02:10:38	Cruz has to be dying. Dying with eagerness to talk about this.
amandacarpenter	698690625366073345	2016-02-14T02:10:00	Whiff. Whiff. Whiff.
amandacarpenter	698690412421259264	2016-02-14T02:09:10	Kasich lives in fantasy land. Like Obama isn't going to push a nom. FANTASY LAND.
amandacarpenter	698690266941800448	2016-02-14T02:08:35	Got it. Kasich wants to pretend Obama isn't going to play brutal bareknuckled politics on a nom. Move on pls.
amandacarpenter	698690038268370944	2016-02-14T02:07:40	Why are we asking Kasich and Trump questions about SCOTUS when you have two senators sitting right there? This is dumb.
amandacarpenter	698689882697371648	2016-02-14T02:07:03	A reminder of how much moderator Kim Strassell loathes conservative activists 
amandacarpenter	698689199587856385	2016-02-14T02:04:20	So CBS didn't bother to introduce candidates before walkouts and oddly, took a break immediately after intros
amandacarpenter	698681753507069956	2016-02-14T01:34:45	Toobin/Borger on CNN: “Who would take this nomination to take batting practice from the Republicans”
amandacarpenter	698662196138475520	2016-02-14T00:17:02	Beyond its legal value, this is also a nice, concise critique of progressivism in general 
amandacarpenter	698662259774615552	2016-02-14T00:17:17	We are in the middle of contemplating the future of the highest court in the land. Someone pls clue in realDonaldTrump
amandacarpenter	698661860283977729	2016-02-14T00:15:42	Let us all follow Scalia's example. Fight like hell for what we believe in while never hesitating to show humor and kindness to all.
amandacarpenter	698661588849594368	2016-02-14T00:14:37	This is truly a clarifying moment about what's at stake this election. An opportunity for the GOP to come together.
amandacarpenter	698655089037283328	2016-02-13T23:48:48	For anyone wondering, if there's a 4-4 vote in the US Supreme Court, the lower court's ruling would stand
amandacarpenter	698655773983907840	2016-02-13T23:51:31	The Senate, contrary to proliberal belief, does not exist to rubberstamp Obama's wishes and demands.
amandacarpenter	698655504827084804	2016-02-13T23:50:27	Yes, "proliberals." Did I just coin that? Progressive, liberal, all the same.
amandacarpenter	698655228531449857	2016-02-13T23:49:21	For all the proliberals screaming in my feed: The Senate has no obligation, none, to confirm a nominee. That's their power.
amandacarpenter	698648507847036928	2016-02-13T23:22:39	Don't let McConnell hedge language. This is too important. He must say "the Senate WILL NOT fill the vacancy this year." Not "should not."
amandacarpenter	698647825073065986	2016-02-13T23:19:56	I don't want to hear McConnell say "should not." He must say "will not."
amandacarpenter	698647138167820288	2016-02-13T23:17:12	McConnell statement: “this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President.”
amandacarpenter	698645021944377344	2016-02-13T23:08:48	But given the post-legal nature of this President I want McConnell to make a full year commitment to block noms till 2017.
amandacarpenter	698644660026241029	2016-02-13T23:07:21	It's my understanding that per Thurmond rule (no lifetime appt 6 months from election) Senate needs to hold till July
amandacarpenter	698643693776084993	2016-02-13T23:03:31	The best way to honor Scalia is to be as tough and determined as he was to get another Scalia on the court.
amandacarpenter	698643153872691201	2016-02-13T23:01:22	Senate must move quickly to make it known that no nominee will be confirmed this year. Now. Do not let it become about whoever Obama names.
amandacarpenter	698641554278379520	2016-02-13T22:55:01	2 Q's for Mitch: will his GOP Senate exercise power not to confirm a nominee and will he stop it from going into recess at any point in '16?
amandacarpenter	698640952127307777	2016-02-13T22:52:37	McConnell must also make a commitment not to allow the Senate to go into recess until next year. No recess appointments from Obama.
amandacarpenter	698640457178423297	2016-02-13T22:50:39	We should celebrate Scalia's legacy. At the same time, we need a commitment  from GOP Senate leadership: no confirmation this year.
amandacarpenter	698639163554447361	2016-02-13T22:45:31	Mitch McConnell, you have a chance to redeem yourself. Hold. The. Line.
amandacarpenter	698638486958686209	2016-02-13T22:42:50	No nominees until we get a new President. The GOP Senate should not confirm a SCOTUS nom for a lame duck POTUS.
amandacarpenter	698632133515071492	2016-02-13T22:17:35	Gut punch. Rest in peace Justice Scalia.
amandacarpenter	698623042117877760	2016-02-13T21:41:27	When I advise candidates, I remind them that elections are not about what you've done. Bless you. It's about where do we go from here!

amandacarpenter	698606038178734081	2016-02-13T20:33:53	I'm in the activist conservative camp. Always have been. Always will be. I'm a Human Events, Townhall, TWT, DeMint, Cruz alum.
amandacarpenter	698605455870976001	2016-02-13T20:31:34	Cruz and Rubio have used their time much differently in the Senate. That's OK to talk about, too. What's NOT OK is a Trump nominee! :)
amandacarpenter	698605313700839425	2016-02-13T20:31:00	Cruz and Rubio are both conservatives. But they have real disagreements over immigration, security, and tactics. It's OK to talk about.
amandacarpenter	698605033647120384	2016-02-13T20:29:54	It was a great line! Loved it. Like many folks, I continue to hope the race comes down to Cruz and Rubio. NOT TRUMP. 
amandacarpenter	698603734205665280	2016-02-13T20:24:44	RightHandManSJ Ha
amandacarpenter	698603065641996292	2016-02-13T20:22:04	Yep. They are better at this than we are.  
amandacarpenter	698601682809262080	2016-02-13T20:16:35	Waiting for GOP to have WH, House, and 67 R's in Senate is a recipe to never accomplish anything.
amandacarpenter	698601494233354240	2016-02-13T20:15:50	At some point there has to be enough ppl to draw a line and say, "We are not doing this."
amandacarpenter	698601270660239361	2016-02-13T20:14:56	This isn't a critique aimed at Rubio, I promise. But, ask yourself, why is PP funded while GOP controls Congress? Why?
amandacarpenter	698600856875372544	2016-02-13T20:13:18	Is the ink organic? 
amandacarpenter	698599556880011264	2016-02-13T20:08:08	conradclose I know what they said. I also know what I saw in the US Senate. I can think for myself.
amandacarpenter	698598641599062016	2016-02-13T20:04:30	The Rubio camp is really going to accuse Cruz of "lying" about the fact Rubio wasn't actively pushing a gov't shutdown over PP?
amandacarpenter	698596378021404672	2016-02-13T19:55:30	With Clinton emails climbing to ~1,700, her decision to exclusively conduct official biz on an unsecure server looks even more reckless
amandacarpenter	698593191956758533	2016-02-13T19:42:50	Expanding Medicaid by exec order of GOP legislatures objections is awfully close. Tyrannical.

amandacarpenter	698315853444554752	2016-02-13T01:20:48	cj_s10 well luckily Cruz didn’t say one thing about how pro-life Rubio is. He criticized him not supporting shutdown to defund PP. lheal
amandacarpenter	698296294335361024	2016-02-13T00:03:04	This article contains much of the same explanation I was relaying here on Twitter.  
amandacarpenter	698292851231162369	2016-02-12T23:49:24	No. There is always a disagreement with tactics. Fine. The Rubio supporters are blowing up at me. Not me at them. 
amandacarpenter	698291375679254529	2016-02-12T23:43:32	So, yes, I'd like to see R's threaten a shutdown to defund it. That's me. That's my belief. Has nothing to do w/ Cruz.
amandacarpenter	698291199510126592	2016-02-12T23:42:50	I believe if the party isn't willing to fight for life, there should be no party. It's one of those kinds of issues.
amandacarpenter	698291034241966080	2016-02-12T23:42:10	Listen, there are differences of opinion. I personally believe a gov't shutdown would be worth defunding PP. Others disagree. Fine.
amandacarpenter	698289064080900096	2016-02-12T23:34:21	I'm not questioning whether Rubio is pro-life, but he definitely missed some opportunities to work to defund PP in the Senate. That's all.
amandacarpenter	698288720315752448	2016-02-12T23:32:59	Here's a Des Moines Register piece about Rubio skipping votes to defund Planned Parenthood

amandacarpenter	698287598066802688	2016-02-12T23:28:31	As with everything, there's a big difference between merely voting for a bill and messaging, organizing, and gathering support for the vote.
amandacarpenter	698287358324535296	2016-02-12T23:27:34	People looking at Rubio versus Cruz on life? I do remember these questions from last Sept 
amandacarpenter	698285994861199360	2016-02-12T23:22:09	RobColeDC To be clear, he is not complaining about it. I am. Just me.
amandacarpenter	698284429911986176	2016-02-12T23:15:56	amandacarpenter Kind of like, "Sell me this property, or I will get my political cronies to take it from you."
amandacarpenter	698284027032129536	2016-02-12T23:14:20	Trump has a demand. He wants Cruz to comply, or he will take Cruz to court for an unrelated matter. It's pretty gross.
amandacarpenter	698283721883934720	2016-02-12T23:13:07	What if Trump said "Give me a $1M or I'll take you to court over some other completely unrelated matter." It's legal extortion.
amandacarpenter	698283566690492416	2016-02-12T23:12:30	Trump isn't going to use the courts to settle any legal question. He wants to use it as a weapon of political warfare.
amandacarpenter	698283398003986432	2016-02-12T23:11:50	Trump says Cruz has to stop the ads or he'll sue over citizenship. Surely the courts would consider Trump's political motivation...
amandacarpenter	698272319857233920	2016-02-12T22:27:48	Team Jeb: Rubio is a phony on family values given some of the hip-hop he listens to  This is nonsense. Full stop.

amandacarpenter	698213054492749824	2016-02-12T18:32:19	The better question is why Trump, with all his money, wasn't willing to support a conservative group such as the Club for Growth?
amandacarpenter	698212416530882562	2016-02-12T18:29:46	Jeb's camp pushing an internal poll showing them a distant third and just two ahead of Rubio. How bad are things for Jeb that this is good?
amandacarpenter	698211779885699072	2016-02-12T18:27:15	Donald Trump is the only person who thinks the Club would have changed their message in exchange for his money.
amandacarpenter	698211679583121410	2016-02-12T18:26:51	Lemme get this straight. Club for Growth asked Trump for $ to promote free markets. He declined. They still promote free markets.

amandacarpenter	698145929136726016	2016-02-12T14:05:35	No. Not at all. Strassel was obviously bidding for Rubio and smearing Cruz with terrible, embarrassing analysis. 
amandacarpenter	698144510275006464	2016-02-12T13:59:56	Yes, last line of Strassel's column on 11/19 says Cruz's "record closer to Bernie Sanders than to the GOP." And she's moderating tomorrow.
amandacarpenter	698143447941689345	2016-02-12T13:55:43	Oh, and how can I forget. Strassel also said Cruz and Bernie Sanders have the same position on national security. That was a good one.
amandacarpenter	698142702030827521	2016-02-12T13:52:45	In this piece she called Cruz, Heritage, Freedomworks and many others "suicidal" over the defund effort 
amandacarpenter	698142225738235904	2016-02-12T13:50:52	Oh, I'm also reminded that WSJ's Kim Strassell, and reliable Cruz basher, is a debate moderator tomorrow. But Cruz isn't crying about it.

amandacarpenter	698129893867933696	2016-02-12T13:01:51	I see Trump's new positive campaign strategy is to stamp his feet and cry that Cruz is a liar over and over again.

amandacarpenter	695418422591561728	2016-02-05T01:27:26	Perhaps Trump has come to the conclusion his negative tactics against Cruz didn't work and he needs to go positive. We shall see!

amandacarpenter	694891947048173568	2016-02-03T14:35:25	So Trump woke up and realized he wasn't in the headlines. Here's the media's new assignment for the day.
amandacarpenter	694891374727057408	2016-02-03T14:33:08	Fraud! Trump is accusing Cruz of voter fraud. Trump can take that to the same court where he brings his crazy tinfoil birther lawsuit, too

amandacarpenter	694671851474305028	2016-02-03T00:00:50	IMHO Cruz never needed to apologize for not clarifying confusion Carson himself caused, but Cruz is taking the high road. Good on him.
amandacarpenter	694671582321643520	2016-02-02T23:59:46	Good for Carson accepting Cruz's apology. Somewhat maddening to see him still accuse Cruz of dirty tactics, but whatever, time to move on.

amandacarpenter	692899298611060736	2016-01-29T02:37:20	If Cruz's joke about leaving the debate didn't land, then Trump's actual decision to abandon the debate won't play in Iowa, either.
amandacarpenter	692899034093064193	2016-01-29T02:36:17	It was a joke.  
amandacarpenter	692898136348561408	2016-01-29T02:32:43	Why does it feel like this is the first time Kasich has been on the debate stage?
amandacarpenter	692895496306692096	2016-01-29T02:22:14	This is so so tame compared to the first Fox debate.

amandacarpenter	692894166129377284	2016-01-29T02:16:57	His charity..? Because Trump still hasn't designated the vets charity, right...? 
amandacarpenter	692893976400007169	2016-01-29T02:16:11	Fox needs to mix this up a little more if they want this to be exciting sans Trump.
amandacarpenter	692893631657615364	2016-01-29T02:14:49	Debate lesson #1: Never be fooled by reaction in the room.  Campaigns can stack the deck there.
amandacarpenter	692893742005485569	2016-01-29T02:15:16	As I watch this debate, I keep picturing Trump sitting all alone in his fancy plane.
amandacarpenter	692844729726214144	2016-01-28T23:00:30	You can watch Trump, Huckabee, and Santo or...everyone else. I choose everyone else.
amandacarpenter	692844627569672193	2016-01-28T23:00:06	Trump is now essentially holding an undercard event with vets as the audience.
amandacarpenter	692844500641656833	2016-01-28T22:59:36	Doesn't it look bad for Trump to be appearing at a non-debate event with the two lowest polling candidates in the field?

amandacarpenter	692831959983091712	2016-01-28T22:09:46	I am dreading watching the Trump vet event. It feels so crass. Showy. Exploitative. Wrong.
amandacarpenter	692830524897820674	2016-01-28T22:04:03	Recommendation for candidates: if Fox asks you a Trump question tonight, simply state "He's not here. I am" and let the silence build.
amandacarpenter	692830072412180480	2016-01-28T22:02:16	GOP candidates. Pls go ahead and ignore Trump tonight. The media is giving him far too much attention as it is.
amandacarpenter	692829147912146945	2016-01-28T21:58:35	Of course. Trump brings it back to birtherism. What a nut. 
amandacarpenter	692828008592310273	2016-01-28T21:54:04	Trump is shielding himself with veterans to avoid criticism for his stupid pissing match with Ailes &amp; skipping the debate
amandacarpenter	692827632270983168	2016-01-28T21:52:34	Listen, I don't doubt that Trump wants to help vets--and has in the past. But using them to give himself political cover is unseemly.
amandacarpenter	692823414109818880	2016-01-28T21:35:48	I mean, just encourage people to donate directly to the veterans. Or maybe make a pledge. Why must it go thru Trump's 501c3?
amandacarpenter	692823191207698433	2016-01-28T21:34:55	Why is Donald Trump making people donate to the Donald J. Trump foundation in order to help vets? 
amandacarpenter	692810989822185473	2016-01-28T20:46:26	Trump isn't just using vets as political props. He's also using them to fundraise for his own personal foundation.

amandacarpenter	692724919881207808	2016-01-28T15:04:25	My question. Why on Earth is the Trump campaign going after an executive's daughter? Is Ivanka fair game now? Is this how we play?
amandacarpenter	692724637029892096	2016-01-28T15:03:18	Guys. Fox is not throwing the election because one executive's daughter is working for Rubio. This is asinine.

amandacarpenter	692721409089404928	2016-01-28T14:50:28	Trump isn't using his great platform to make the case for conservative victory. It's about losers and bimbos, all the time. It's gross!
amandacarpenter	692721067484286976	2016-01-28T14:49:07	It's all about Trump, all the time And his fights with Fox. Fox is not the enemy! The Democrats are! Wake up, people!
amandacarpenter	692720941822902272	2016-01-28T14:48:37	Trump is not channeling the attention on himself for any common good. Dems are getting a big, fat free pass on everything!
amandacarpenter	692720825913331712	2016-01-28T14:48:09	Going to scream. We are SO FOCUSED on Trump. Meanwhile, a friggin socialist held a presser outside the WH Weds--about his great campaign!
amandacarpenter	692719548009730048	2016-01-28T14:43:05	Amazing that Rubio is on upswing in IA, despite RTR $$ dropped on him. So far Bush $$ has neither helped him nor hurt Rubio (at least in IA)

amandacarpenter	692360648899039233	2016-01-27T14:56:56	Voters like many things about Trump. But worry about unpredictability, erratic behavior, impulsiveness. Debate gambit could intensify doubt.
amandacarpenter	692359733819346947	2016-01-27T14:53:18	Important: despite Bernie &amp; Trump's claims of exciting new voters, registration in IA has DROPPED for both parties.

amandacarpenter	692149613424447488	2016-01-27T00:58:22	What just happened: Ted Cruz pounces on Trump news to call him CHICKEN and challenge him to a one-on-one debate on marklevinshow.
amandacarpenter	692147969055932417	2016-01-27T00:51:49	Ted Cruz just challenged Donald Trump t o a one-on-one, "mano-a-mano" debate on talk radio.

amandacarpenter	692139907284869120	2016-01-27T00:19:47	I'm thrilled Trump is boycotting. The best parts of previous debates have been when he's not talking.

amandacarpenter	692092046388006916	2016-01-26T21:09:36	Of course this won't happen. Both Fox and Trump want the drama of the "will he or won't he," but it is awfully silly, right?
amandacarpenter	692091579809411076	2016-01-26T21:07:45	We're two days out. Shouldn't the candidate have decided if he's going to appear or not? Enough w/ the last minute theatrics.
amandacarpenter	692091465380425729	2016-01-26T21:07:18	At this point with all the fighting between Fox and Trump, maybe Fox ought to say, you know what, you're disinvited.
amandacarpenter	692089261722456064	2016-01-26T20:58:33	Conservatives had to get drunk and vote for John McCain before. Well, if it's Cruz or Rubio, I'll buy a round for these geezers this time.
amandacarpenter	692089024794619904	2016-01-26T20:57:36	If the GOP isn't successful it's because these power hungry, legacy, relics strangle new conservative leaders in the cradle.
amandacarpenter	692088821790298112	2016-01-26T20:56:48	I've said many times I'd like to see the race come down to Cruz and Rubio. It is disgusting what the old bulls are doing to them both
amandacarpenter	692088663778263040	2016-01-26T20:56:10	Bob Dole had his shot. And he didn't become President Dole, either.

amandacarpenter	684930982726746112	2016-01-07T02:54:06	I'm so entertained by this. 
amandacarpenter	684929064071737345	2016-01-07T02:46:28	Of course.  
amandacarpenter	684924903389294598	2016-01-07T02:29:56	John McCain isn't sure Cruz is eligible to be President because he hasn't decided where "wacko birds" originate from.

amandacarpenter	684869865191174144	2016-01-06T22:51:14	Earlier, I basically accused Cruz of flip-flopping on ethanol. After further review, I think I was wrong: 
amandacarpenter	684870012335734785	2016-01-06T22:51:49	CORRECTED: Cruz still favors slashing ethanol mandate every year for five years |  mea culpa
amandacarpenter	684871572050477056	2016-01-06T22:58:01	amandacarpenter Carney’s got a great response to the claim here: 
amandacarpenter	684871362209386496	2016-01-06T22:57:11	ChrisMField ah gotcha. I disagree with Jazz. Ha.
amandacarpenter	684870660644966400	2016-01-06T22:54:24	ChrisMField no he didn't. He's supported the phase out for a long time
amandacarpenter	684848188365221888	2016-01-06T21:25:06	In Spirit Lake, Cruz is asked again about ethanol. Citing DMR op-ed out this PM, he gets applause for saying he wants to phase out RFS.

amandacarpenter	684844338086567936	2016-01-06T21:09:48	Lobbyists gotta justify their salaries somehow! 
amandacarpenter	684841401985675265	2016-01-06T20:58:08	Darn it, young women! DWS wants you to get excited about abortion and vote Hillary! Get with it! 
amandacarpenter	684841195697213441	2016-01-06T20:57:19	DWS: I see a complacency among the generation of young women whose entire lives have been lived after Roe v. Wade was decided.
amandacarpenter	684840970798632961	2016-01-06T20:56:25	Here is the link where DWS blames the enthusiasm gap on young women who aren't enthusiastic about baby killing 
amandacarpenter	684840659493253120	2016-01-06T20:55:11	HA. DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz says young women aren't enthusiastic about Hillary is because they are "complacent" about abortion
amandacarpenter	684832049027506176	2016-01-06T20:20:58	This is correct. Repeal it, phase it out, just get rid of it.  
amandacarpenter	684831794773012481	2016-01-06T20:19:58	You can read all about Cruz's 2014, repeat 2014 bill, to phrase out RFS over 5 yrs here. It's point #3 
amandacarpenter	684831340970250240	2016-01-06T20:18:09	I'm just thrilled to see so many people want Cruz to end RFS faster. What other candidates are talking to Iowans about ending it?
amandacarpenter	684831080935985152	2016-01-06T20:17:07	AG_Conservative allahpundit Yes, and then his OWN bill in 2014 called for a phase out. Pursuing all options to end it.
amandacarpenter	684829560764907520	2016-01-06T20:11:05	Still supports phase out.  It's just that 2017+5=2022 so ARF is acting like he's agreeing with them. Nonsense 
amandacarpenter	684827692194086912	2016-01-06T20:03:39	It honestly feels like a pressure group trolled Cruz and asked reporters who don't cover ethanol (uh, hi) to fall for it.
amandacarpenter	684827341789343744	2016-01-06T20:02:16	Don't understand the "Cruz flip-flopped on RFS" charge. He's always been for a 5-year phase-out. If he takes office in 2017, that ends 2022.
amandacarpenter	684827236906708993	2016-01-06T20:01:51	Cruz has both called for repeal and a phase out for RFS. He'll end it whatever way he can, is the main point. How will the other candidates?
amandacarpenter	684826937039171584	2016-01-06T20:00:39	TPCarney His comprehensive 2014 energy bill had the five year phase out 
amandacarpenter	684825577216434177	2016-01-06T19:55:15	And just for good measure...here is Cruz's release, from 2014, that calls for a 5-year RFS phase out 
amandacarpenter	684825274299641858	2016-01-06T19:54:03	Txsleuthe No the position has always been repeal the subsidies and phase out RFS mandate over 5 years.
amandacarpenter	684825163309944834	2016-01-06T19:53:37	Here is a link to a bill Cruz sponsored with Rep. Bridenstine to  phase out and repeal RFS over 5 years 
amandacarpenter	684824720722755584	2016-01-06T19:51:51	It is now the year 2016. 2016+5 years is the year 2021. Someone wants to make that seem like Cruz supports full RFS till 2022.
amandacarpenter	684824370632617985	2016-01-06T19:50:28	I just listened to the Cruz audio. He said what he's always said. RFS should be a 5-year phase out. It's what his legislation said in 2014
amandacarpenter	684822725601456128	2016-01-06T19:43:55	Cruz position: end energy subsidies now, phase out the RFS mandate. How are the other candidates going to do it?
amandacarpenter	684821628694478853	2016-01-06T19:39:34	Cruz also argues mandates HURTS Iowa farmers. Which is confusing for ppl who want to believe Cruz hates Iowa farmers.
amandacarpenter	684821370488885249	2016-01-06T19:38:32	Cruz wants to phase out RFS, that's nothing new. Phasing out is the responsible way to end the mandate
amandacarpenter	684821069224632320	2016-01-06T19:37:20	This is Cruz's position on ethanol. DMR op-ed posted less than an hour ago 
amandacarpenter	684736674925015040	2016-01-06T14:01:59	This by KirstenPowers, "Cosby, Clinton and predatory men," is potentially devastating to HillaryClinton's chances. 
amandacarpenter	684721002203471872	2016-01-06T12:59:43	I'm old enough to remember when the first Clinton administration was bragging about stopping the North Korean nuclear program.

amandacarpenter	684515474420404227	2016-01-05T23:23:01	But, as Trump says, if someone gains in the polls he has to criticize them for something! So, flip flopperyoo it is

amandacarpenter	684513774926172161	2016-01-05T23:16:16	I'm just gonna say that if the election comes down to a YouTube/GIF war with Trump, my $ is on MrJoshPerry
amandacarpenter	684513637650817024	2016-01-05T23:15:43	Trump again says something stupid about Cruz, Cruz replies with a funny video. I like this game. It's a convo stopper.
