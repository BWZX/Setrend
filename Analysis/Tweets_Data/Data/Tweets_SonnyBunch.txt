SonnyBunch	724664005198008321	2016-04-25T18:18:57	I’m ambivalent about Prince, the musician. But I really, really respected Prince the artist/businessman.

SonnyBunch	724658317436571648	2016-04-25T17:56:21	cjane87 yeah but that had the drawback of looking like it was shot in front of a green screen in someone’s basement

SonnyBunch	724655825269215233	2016-04-25T17:46:26	TNG’s peaks were higher, but DS9’s linked storytelling made for a more satisfying multi-season run.

SonnyBunch	722501318074634240	2016-04-19T19:05:12	The only way to solve this mystery is for Shaun King’s editors at the NYDailyNews to release his raw copy. I imagine it’d be illuminating.
SonnyBunch	722500417133928448	2016-04-19T19:01:37	I don’t find it hard to believe that Shaun King is such a terrible writer his editor has no idea where quotes start. 
SonnyBunch	722500223831044102	2016-04-19T19:00:51	Oh, also, that formatting error removed a citation to the Daily Beast.  
SonnyBunch	722500020637982721	2016-04-19T19:00:02	Maybe it was a formatting error that stripped out the link/blockquote! As it appears, though, it’s 100% plagiarism.

SonnyBunch	722440700873326592	2016-04-19T15:04:20	2/2: Chuck also hates Jimmy because Jimmy doesn’t respect the law, as a concept. “He hurt the client!” is Chuck’s (correct!) refrain.

SonnyBunch	713929948684222464	2016-03-27T03:25:38	Jsalow14 I have thoughts but I put most of the blame on WB writ large.
SonnyBunch	713929762708787202	2016-03-27T03:24:54	$170M + 67% drop in weekend one + 67% drop in weekend two = modest disappointment, but not enough of one to learn the needed lesson.
SonnyBunch	713928281897218049	2016-03-27T03:19:01	Hopefully, this means WB will just ignore all the things that were wrong about BvS. The Al-Ighty Ollar has spoken!

SonnyBunch	710112904104828928	2016-03-16T14:38:04	As Anton Chigurh once said, "That's the best deal your gonna get." Friendo. 
SonnyBunch	710109673807028224	2016-03-16T14:25:14	Beautiful, moving and heartfelt Medium post from my friend evepeyser: 
SonnyBunch	710109049220669440	2016-03-16T14:22:45	Best. Nominee. Ever. 
SonnyBunch	710108073675923457	2016-03-16T14:18:52	This how Third World strongmen act  
SonnyBunch	710107842364235776	2016-03-16T14:17:57	POTUS should have picked this guy 
SonnyBunch	710107108310716416	2016-03-16T14:15:02	My excitement level for a protracted nominee fight is, frankly, relatively low after last night.
SonnyBunch	710105998153932802	2016-03-16T14:10:37	Smart!  
SonnyBunch	710103100279885824	2016-03-16T13:59:06	Low-energy Dan Drezner is now openly begging book publishers for a shot at fame. No wonder BuzzFeed fired him. Sad! 
SonnyBunch	710092617862676481	2016-03-16T13:17:27	"Trump is like the emotionally reactive ectoplasm from 'Ghostbusters II.'" Me on Trump v Breitbart AND protestors: 
SonnyBunch	710088895371747328	2016-03-16T13:02:40	Whoa, Saul Alinsky's corpse is Obama's SCOTUS pick? Bold strategy, Cotton!
SonnyBunch	710085637408423936	2016-03-16T12:49:43	dandrezner JeffreyGoldberg Easily the reason I resent him most tbh.
SonnyBunch	710082628028932096	2016-03-16T12:37:45	It's Trump.  
SonnyBunch	710082133994446848	2016-03-16T12:35:48	I take it I'm Aquaman in this scenario.  
SonnyBunch	709978681993764865	2016-03-16T05:44:43	Won whites without college degrees. 
SonnyBunch	709956019451994117	2016-03-16T04:14:40	Anti-Trump forces will fight to deny him nomination. And will move on Track Two-an Independent Republican candidate. 
SonnyBunch	709955191282470913	2016-03-16T04:11:22	RalstonReports very very strongly
SonnyBunch	709955108470185984	2016-03-16T04:11:02	And the Seven Society claims it has power.  
SonnyBunch	709954525159940098	2016-03-16T04:08:43	I’m a VERY SPECIFIC kind of idiot, thank you.  
SonnyBunch	709954255151636480	2016-03-16T04:07:39	makes sense these are the end times 
SonnyBunch	709953669421084672	2016-03-16T04:05:19	my understanding is that wmata is shutting down service for 24 hours so as to institute a series of midnight meat trains

SonnyBunch	709952394939871232	2016-03-16T04:00:15	petersuderman it’s not weird so much as convoluted
SonnyBunch	709952193982390272	2016-03-16T03:59:27	petersuderman So, w/r/t movies, it’s like “bad movies should be rewarded for punishing bad people in good ways"
SonnyBunch	709951968794443776	2016-03-16T03:58:34	petersuderman yah, but it’s more complicated in that I think bad people should be punished in bad movies
SonnyBunch	709951467998674944	2016-03-16T03:56:34	seanmdav he’s smarter than me tbh
SonnyBunch	709951377900830720	2016-03-16T03:56:13	The Bunch Theory of Politics: “Bad people should be punished." 
SonnyBunch	709951113051525120	2016-03-16T03:55:10	I hope we go to a contested convention.  And Trump is denied a spot on the ballot.  Because he is bad.  And bad people should be punished.
SonnyBunch	709950113464987649	2016-03-16T03:51:11	AntonVuljaj Yeah, I mean, it’s not rocket science. You just say the things you’re supposed to say. All it requires is a lack of shame.
SonnyBunch	709949975954731008	2016-03-16T03:50:39	JohnEkdahl EsotericCD only because noted squish B_M_Finnigan runs it
SonnyBunch	709949583405658113	2016-03-16T03:49:05	JohnEkdahl EsotericCD tbh i would probably put you both in the middle circle of The Chart
SonnyBunch	709949338462461953	2016-03-16T03:48:07	This isn’t sarcasm: this is analysis. Katrina Pierson's really good at her job.  
SonnyBunch	709949224041848832	2016-03-16T03:47:39	Katrina Pierson is a good spokeswoman because she blindly repeats what she is told to blindly repeat.
