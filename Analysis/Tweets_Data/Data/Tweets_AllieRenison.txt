AllieRenison	726072732417449984	2016-04-29T15:36:43	jamieamartin1 CharlotteV now im happy to concede, as Swiss ex. also showed, that current projects not suddenly stripped of ongoing funds

AllieRenison	719563146021715969	2016-04-11T16:29:57	Ridiculous line: "It’s China’s influence on the global price of steel that matters, not its share of UK imports"

AllieRenison	719559895633260544	2016-04-11T16:17:02	Mancman10 for every 1 job tariffs save in steel production (less than a tenth of UK GDP and 1% of manufacturing output*), 8 lost in wider

AllieRenison	719558645793583104	2016-04-11T16:12:04	Mancman10 glad to see you putting politics ahead of economics and long term perspective
AllieRenison	719557882174435328	2016-04-11T16:09:02	Javid: "We have consistently opposed tariffs on unfairly dumped Chinese steel". Key word being unfairly. As in proven. The appropriate gauge

AllieRenison	719556811246985216	2016-04-11T16:04:47	However, Javid is right to remind us that Tata could very well have gone with the nuclear option perspective

AllieRenison	701907945819344897	2016-02-22T23:14:29	Can't help but wonder if the PM had just committed to a straight In/Out ref, whether there would be less backbenchers supporting Out.
AllieRenison	701900724196737029	2016-02-22T22:45:47	So the arg. against TTIP is now that the EU is willing to eliminate its import tariffs? Good heavens that does it 
AllieRenison	701876487725707264	2016-02-22T21:09:29	Paint watches Michael Owen dry.
AllieRenison	701881634031857664	2016-02-22T21:29:56	mjhsinclair like the burden reduction targets. Vagueness refers to the lack of detail on how the two other mechanisms will work in practice
AllieRenison	701881504926978048	2016-02-22T21:29:25	mjhsinclair the summary references commitments in the Competitiveness section being vague and then focuses on what there was on specifics
AllieRenison	701879764454342657	2016-02-22T21:22:30	mjhsinclair they're not thinking again about annual burden reduction targets, they've committed to them.
AllieRenison	701878610509094913	2016-02-22T21:17:55	mjhsinclair from a business point of view, things like process, method, treaty change or not is irrelevant. Policy outcomes are what matter
AllieRenison	701878496948264961	2016-02-22T21:17:28	mjhsinclair kinda feel your splitting hairs there w/respect to the fact it cd have come from reneg or cd at some point in future from Comm
AllieRenison	701876575051112449	2016-02-22T21:09:50	mjhsinclair because under their Better Regulation action plan and Work Programme for 2016 they decided against targets despite biz lobbying
AllieRenison	701876417676623872	2016-02-22T21:09:12	mjhsinclair they know overhaul wont happen overnight
AllieRenison	701876378900242432	2016-02-22T21:09:03	mjhsinclair from talking to biz up and down the country every day amongst our members, what they want are steps in the right direction and
AllieRenison	701876255197630464	2016-02-22T21:08:34	mjhsinclair and IMHO the Commish has been taking progressive steps in the right direction ever since the new one came in
AllieRenison	701876122515066882	2016-02-22T21:08:02	mjhsinclair to me, more in that basket of relevance to biz than I expected, IoD members seemed to agree, they're steps in right direction
AllieRenison	701875005743886338	2016-02-22T21:03:36	mjhsinclair let's revert in a few months time to see whether they have or not, i'm willing to bet they will have
AllieRenison	701874455291830273	2016-02-22T21:01:24	mjhsinclair i mean i can show where you in the most recent IIA agreed in December they refused targets. now will be absorbed into agreement
AllieRenison	701874332138606592	2016-02-22T21:00:55	mjhsinclair i expected it to be a restatement of things it was doing, and the targets and mechanism require new action
AllieRenison	701873299446431754	2016-02-22T20:56:49	mjhsinclair no, but i was disputing your claim it was a bogus reform
AllieRenison	701873212058169344	2016-02-22T20:56:28	mjhsinclair they#d refused targets. subsidiarity and burden reduction mechanism and requirement to w/draw measures annually is substantive
AllieRenison	701872165096919041	2016-02-22T20:52:18	Also, could Jurgen Maier and other Inners *please* refrain from going as far as saying Brexit = cutting UK off from EU/Single Market

AllieRenison	701799555130589188	2016-02-22T16:03:47	Would humbly suggest the PM not agree with Ken Clarke's impressive level of scaremongering there

AllieRenison	701381947575160833	2016-02-21T12:24:22	ajcdeane edwardbowles1 i know. But implication from many is there. Being called a sell-out as a joke (by some) goes to heart of problem
AllieRenison	701381429431812096	2016-02-21T12:22:18	ajcdeane edwardbowles1 however, while I lean towards In, not sold just yet. EU court the biggest thing keeping me from an enthusiastic In

AllieRenison	701370411007799296	2016-02-21T11:38:31	ScottJFletcher RCorbettMEP arguing for Brexit on basis of more trade deals and then opposing TTIP aint exactly consistent. Best of luck

AllieRenison	701369270350045184	2016-02-21T11:33:59	ScottJFletcher RCorbettMEP by that measure we should oppose any trade deal, whether European or not
AllieRenison	701369039138983936	2016-02-21T11:33:04	ScottJFletcher RCorbettMEP if u look at the studies, UK has more to gain from TTIP than many continental countries
AllieRenison	701368876483874816	2016-02-21T11:32:25	ScottJFletcher RCorbettMEP are you aware that UK and EU objectives are one and the same on a trade deal with the US?
AllieRenison	701368670434500608	2016-02-21T11:31:36	ScottJFletcher RCorbettMEP let me get this straight - u think TTIP wd be bad b/c EU is negotiating but US/UK one wd be OK?

AllieRenison	701367636542803968	2016-02-21T11:27:29	ScottJFletcher RCorbettMEP at the facts of their record. Ive had US negotiators tell me TTIP is 1st time they look at other side as equal
AllieRenison	701367380581212161	2016-02-21T11:26:28	ScottJFletcher RCorbettMEP trade deals? US very good at extracting a lot and not giving much up to small countries. UK wd struggle. Look

AllieRenison	701366410031792129	2016-02-21T11:22:37	ScottJFletcher RCorbettMEP it's a fact that outside the EU we cd do our own trade deals. It's also a fact that we havent done one in 40
AllieRenison	701366182587330560	2016-02-21T11:21:43	ScottJFletcher RCorbettMEP there are facts on all sides and we can quote them at each other all day :)
AllieRenison	701366070708404224	2016-02-21T11:21:16	ScottJFletcher RCorbettMEP what about the fact that free movement is a corollary of having *fuller* access to the Single Market?

AllieRenison	701361002496073728	2016-02-21T11:01:08	AgnesCPoirier i know. But im afraid you are an exception to the rule, and will be judged as having a diff view b/c of the French connexion
AllieRenison	701359260639301632	2016-02-21T10:54:13	At least indyref had emotional patriotic case for defenders of the Union to make. Just doesnt inherently exist for EU in UK's social fabric
