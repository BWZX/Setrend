izakaminska	724216621594738688	2016-04-24T12:41:12	indysmith Frances_Coppola but I suspect it's not practically realistic.
izakaminska	724216566385094656	2016-04-24T12:40:59	indysmith Frances_Coppola it's a nice idea to try pass costs over to those who r dumb and rich enough to not realise they're being duped
izakaminska	724216413360144384	2016-04-24T12:40:22	indysmith Frances_Coppola it can only work if some portion of those speculators are permanently mislead about the costs of system
izakaminska	724216297618284544	2016-04-24T12:39:55	indysmith Frances_Coppola yes. Precisely. Idea that the speculative free market will permanently underwrite trade altruistically is naive

izakaminska	724214723638661120	2016-04-24T12:33:40	indysmith Frances_Coppola well, some people think a speculator funded virtual bridging currency could do the trick.
izakaminska	724199409324556288	2016-04-24T11:32:48	Frances_Coppola the alternative tho is a world with no intl bridging currency which would seriously increase cost of trade/transaction

izakaminska	716633769738964992	2016-04-03T14:29:39	cjenscook Frances_Coppola yes they do if it works, but they also put their capital at risk if it doesn't work.
izakaminska	716633620480466944	2016-04-03T14:29:04	cjenscook Frances_Coppola It works maybe on a small scale, but not on a large international global banking scale.
izakaminska	716633543309398017	2016-04-03T14:28:45	cjenscook Frances_Coppola Sorry, I genuinely don't see how it's 3.0. The mutation of the p2p lenders into banks proves suggests otherwise
izakaminska	716633164865732608	2016-04-03T14:27:15	cjenscook Frances_Coppola The rules of banking are determined on a collective bottom up basis for risk mgmt reasons
izakaminska	716633055411179521	2016-04-03T14:26:49	cjenscook Frances_Coppola if there's a regulator, you're basically describing a banking system by another name.
izakaminska	716632825714311168	2016-04-03T14:25:54	cjenscook Frances_Coppola I have no idea what that means.
izakaminska	716632707061645312	2016-04-03T14:25:26	cjenscook Frances_Coppola These structures evolve into banks for a reason. Because the cover has to be invested somewhere.
izakaminska	716631789612228608	2016-04-03T14:21:47	cjenscook Frances_Coppola If you're arguing against passive investors being allowed to be shareholders I totally disagree.
izakaminska	716631277420593152	2016-04-03T14:19:45	cjenscook Frances_Coppola you're just arguing in favour of unregulated shadow banking which is where all the problems begin
izakaminska	716631063460753408	2016-04-03T14:18:54	cjenscook Frances_Coppola banking is done by regulated institutions for a reason
izakaminska	716630816554672129	2016-04-03T14:17:55	cjenscook Frances_Coppola the problem with all cover pool based systems is how the cover is invested in the interim.
izakaminska	716630583426826241	2016-04-03T14:17:00	cjenscook Frances_Coppola only when everyone is benefiting from positive sum game
izakaminska	716630485598912512	2016-04-03T14:16:36	cjenscook Frances_Coppola the structure is no different to a cover pool. And that's what a reserve system is.
izakaminska	716629253962526720	2016-04-03T14:11:43	cjenscook Frances_Coppola and when sacrifices are big the game theory encourages you to break contract and look after yourself.
izakaminska	716629103403802624	2016-04-03T14:11:07	cjenscook Frances_Coppola you can't change the fact that if the system goes broke, someone has to make sacrifices
izakaminska	716628869684572160	2016-04-03T14:10:11	cjenscook Frances_Coppola without any enforcement authority! When things go bad you just walk away.
izakaminska	716628759944826880	2016-04-03T14:09:45	cjenscook Frances_Coppola tokens are endogenous and will always manifest.
izakaminska	716628640180662273	2016-04-03T14:09:16	cjenscook Frances_Coppola and no other networks to tap for funding.
izakaminska	716628544940601344	2016-04-03T14:08:54	cjenscook Frances_Coppola there is just you having to do all your own leg work a la Mad Max coz if it goes wrong no reserves to draw on
izakaminska	716628308897693696	2016-04-03T14:07:57	cjenscook Frances_Coppola without a defined guarantor or an entity who agrees to go without in a crisis, there is no financial mkt
izakaminska	716627755081809921	2016-04-03T14:05:45	cjenscook Frances_Coppola having everyone audit everyone else all the time is a really inefficient system. NOT triple entry
izakaminska	716627303271411712	2016-04-03T14:03:58	cjenscook Frances_Coppola but you can't remove tokens. You just have to understand they have relative value.
izakaminska	716627057824907265	2016-04-03T14:02:59	cjenscook Frances_Coppola tokens are the confusion in the system because they create the illusion of absolute value
izakaminska	716626923972112386	2016-04-03T14:02:27	cjenscook Frances_Coppola yes &amp; u need both for a financial system. You can't just operate in a backward or forward looking only universe
izakaminska	716626019235598336	2016-04-03T13:58:51	cjenscook Frances_Coppola yes, but that's irrelevant. You can't just have unfunded credits, and you can't have just funds without credit
izakaminska	716625782496485377	2016-04-03T13:57:55	cjenscook Frances_Coppola you have to have proof that the value has been created before you can go about distributing it. That's funding
izakaminska	716625645942534144	2016-04-03T13:57:22	cjenscook Frances_Coppola that's always been the risk in the system. Off chain/off balance sheet/parallel dark networks.
izakaminska	716625509094973440	2016-04-03T13:56:50	cjenscook Frances_Coppola and Blockchain is not triple entry in my opinion. It's just a token based audit, vulnerable to off chain leaks
izakaminska	716625266743906304	2016-04-03T13:55:52	cjenscook Frances_Coppola this idea you can take risk out of the system is totally naive in my opinion.
izakaminska	716625188608196608	2016-04-03T13:55:33	cjenscook Frances_Coppola someone still has to take risk. Without risk there is no growth or even sustained value replacement.
izakaminska	716624920386662401	2016-04-03T13:54:29	cjenscook Frances_Coppola I disagree. Money has to be both backward looking proof and future looking credit.

izakaminska	713379557399793664	2016-03-25T14:58:35	TheBondFreak JoMicheII yes . Much like the tobacco issue. Here more on leptin resistance

izakaminska	713374269200318464	2016-03-25T14:37:34	JoMicheII the addictive aspect increases as your leptin gets skewed. In that sense it's like alcohol abuse

izakaminska	712951590806749184	2016-03-24T10:37:59	bengraham not what a lot of very respected scientists say. All sugar bad, but some sugars and delivery mechanisms worse than others
izakaminska	712951291174076416	2016-03-24T10:36:48	bauhiniacapital BaldingsWorld errr. Carbon taxes?

izakaminska	712950404674359297	2016-03-24T10:33:17	bengraham yes exactly. And fruit juice is equally bad. And sugar tax campaigners say the only flaw in the tax is the juice exception

izakaminska	712949940603985920	2016-03-24T10:31:26	Wikisteff The world at large witnessed this trade. But guess what, tracyalloway didn't use a CCP. And i didn't pledge any collateral.
izakaminska	712949412444704768	2016-03-24T10:29:20	.Wikisteff speaking of which I bought oil from tracyalloway for march delivery for $49.78. Today's price is $39.98.
izakaminska	712947854827003904	2016-03-24T10:23:09	Wikisteff i really don't have to time to continue this convo. But you're getting bogged down in the technicalities and missing the big pic
izakaminska	712947686694068225	2016-03-24T10:22:29	Wikisteff spending development money on solving a problem which is not a problem is stupid.
izakaminska	712947532368912385	2016-03-24T10:21:52	Wikisteff yes but that's an irrelevance. It's only one side of the coin. And the least important side.
izakaminska	712947412445343745	2016-03-24T10:21:23	Wikisteff contracts don't fail coz there is a lack of evidence the contract existed. They fail coz ppl made promises they couldn't deliver
izakaminska	712947189614514176	2016-03-24T10:20:30	Wikisteff steffen you're missing the point. ETH has no authority or skin in the game w/ respect to contract performance. That's the issue
izakaminska	712946932910571522	2016-03-24T10:19:29	bauhiniacapital BaldingsWorld true, regarding people who are already addicted. But it can put off new addicts. And that's important.
izakaminska	712946659798425600	2016-03-24T10:18:24	Wikisteff in other words it requires pre-funding for everything. Which is entirely stupid.
izakaminska	712946591682924544	2016-03-24T10:18:08	Wikisteff the only way it can do so is by checking i hv fairy abilities already. But then the point of a conditional contract is null/void
izakaminska	712946363202453505	2016-03-24T10:17:13	Wikisteff ETH has no authority to enforce the contracts. Which means it has no ability to guarantee the performance of that contract
izakaminska	712946213167955968	2016-03-24T10:16:37	Wikisteff but this is an irrelevance! I can write a contract with you that i will turn into a fairy by March 30. It means nothing.
izakaminska	712945877963374592	2016-03-24T10:15:17	Wikisteff applying hierarchy to a blockchain is like going back to the very thing you were claiming was ineffective.
izakaminska	712945710207991808	2016-03-24T10:14:37	Wikisteff trees in historic chain sense are something different to balance sheet (snap shot) distribution trees.
izakaminska	712945410218831872	2016-03-24T10:13:26	bauhiniacapital BaldingsWorld except our metabolism and our liver wasn't designed for this sort of energy injection.
izakaminska	712945168123564032	2016-03-24T10:12:28	Wikisteff because turns out open flat structures create tragedy of the commons effects. (Highly predictable)
izakaminska	712945076490604544	2016-03-24T10:12:06	Wikisteff precisely. And the only public open system we have that supposedly works is bitcoin. And that's running into governance issues
izakaminska	712944863298330624	2016-03-24T10:11:15	Wikisteff arguing introduction of hierarchy is somehow revolutionary is dumb....  We've known this is the optimum structure for years
izakaminska	712944657123164160	2016-03-24T10:10:26	Wikisteff and btw, that's exactly how current system works. Every bank is a subchain which squares up against a master cbank ledger
izakaminska	712944520837640192	2016-03-24T10:09:54	Wikisteff subchains are just tech jargon for risk outsourcing.
izakaminska	712944314922479617	2016-03-24T10:09:05	Wikisteff this is no different to the current structure which uses division of labour to spread trust across network w/ division of labour
izakaminska	712944115571359744	2016-03-24T10:08:17	Wikisteff and fraud on that front is not solvable by blockchain.
izakaminska	712944018238357506	2016-03-24T10:07:54	Wikisteff in DNS certification all that matters is the duplication of the certificate. In markets the value of the deliverable also matters
izakaminska	712943616767950848	2016-03-24T10:06:18	Wikisteff chained authentication is meaningless in a market sense. Because it's completely different kettle of fish you're dealing with
izakaminska	712943432990232576	2016-03-24T10:05:34	Wikisteff and private blockchains might as well just be called corporate consolidation. Aka. M&amp;A.
izakaminska	712943286596583424	2016-03-24T10:05:00	Wikisteff something like ETH is quasi private because it has inherent concentration issues.
izakaminska	712941072914202624	2016-03-24T09:56:12	wooglooskr yes sorry. Also Twitter not best format for this conversation.
izakaminska	712940971613417473	2016-03-24T09:55:48	wooglooskr An truly flat eco-system only exists in an organic state. "He ain't heavy, he's my brother" -- coz he shares my gene-code
izakaminska	712940806571692032	2016-03-24T09:55:08	wooglooskr and that's because for any medium of exch to be liquid, someone somewhere has to be prepared to take imbalance risk
izakaminska	712940721196634112	2016-03-24T09:54:48	wooglooskr ... over time the imbalances in the network become a problem for those who feel they are offering risk subsidies to the others
izakaminska	712940605937225729	2016-03-24T09:54:20	wooglooskr because no network has perfectly harmonised values. The Euro experiment proves that unless network is highly assimilated ...
izakaminska	712940383953674240	2016-03-24T09:53:27	wooglooskr money is and always has been a claim on a network of people who share similar values. But there are always imbalances.
izakaminska	712939874249281536	2016-03-24T09:51:26	wooglooskr look, we started off talking about Ripple. I've got to go now. This is a bottomless pit discussion.
izakaminska	712939719991169024	2016-03-24T09:50:49	wooglooskr which is sad because gold is actually an excellent conductor.
izakaminska	712939656313225216	2016-03-24T09:50:34	wooglooskr ironically it's because gold is so over-valued as a store of value, that prevents its wider use in industry
izakaminska	712939571277905920	2016-03-24T09:50:14	wooglooskr gold's industrial use is pretty minimal. But that consumption ultimately represents the break-even price floor.
izakaminska	712939370790133760	2016-03-24T09:49:26	wooglooskr commodity supply matters for consumable commods. Silver is more industrial, so that's the underlying support factor
izakaminska	712939006493851648	2016-03-24T09:47:59	wooglooskr no. And again, that's my point. What turned silver into money was the endorsement not the commodity aspect.
izakaminska	712938805322465280	2016-03-24T09:47:11	wooglooskr if economic conditions don't justify the supply, they rein it in. If econ conditions justify more supply, they add it.
izakaminska	712938651290836992	2016-03-24T09:46:34	wooglooskr which is why we have created central banks that "endorse" or "un-endorse" money according to economic conditions
izakaminska	712938395543199744	2016-03-24T09:45:33	wooglooskr or you can agree that it's the capitalisation of the endorser that matters not the commodity supply.
izakaminska	712937992407629824	2016-03-24T09:43:57	wooglooskr china/japan have a long history of paper/commodity switches. Paper was easily over issued. Commods were too restrictive.
izakaminska	712937693093695488	2016-03-24T09:42:46	BaldingsWorld the issue is that sugar delivered by fluid into bloodstream hits the liver directly. Also prevents satiation.
izakaminska	712937497240739840	2016-03-24T09:41:59	wooglooskr silver/copper was used because of its flexible supply. Gold's inflexibility creates cross of gold probs.
izakaminska	712937198627250176	2016-03-24T09:40:48	JohnPReade this is just a flavour of the view 
izakaminska	712937079362166784	2016-03-24T09:40:20	JohnPReade this is genuinely worth your time , and it's the source of the new thinking on these matters
izakaminska	712936585222819840	2016-03-24T09:38:22	NARNfan here you go  
izakaminska	712936161262571520	2016-03-24T09:36:41	wooglooskr you do know about Spain's "silver discovery" linked economic crisis?
izakaminska	712935961622147072	2016-03-24T09:35:53	wooglooskr dealing w/ the counterfeiting prob (the double counting of its day) was a bit of an obsession for Newton when head of Royal Mint
izakaminska	712935749209952256	2016-03-24T09:35:02	wooglooskr they also suffered from their own counterfeiting problems. 
izakaminska	712935549938573312	2016-03-24T09:34:15	wooglooskr silver and copper were too abundant to have value as money without such an endorsement. It was representative
izakaminska	712935358145695744	2016-03-24T09:33:29	BaldingsWorld sugar is doubly harmful when consumed in liquid fizzy drink form. It is not regressive to tax that specific type of delivery
izakaminska	712935212343234560	2016-03-24T09:32:54	BaldingsWorld how much do you know about leptins and receptors and the effects they have on the metabollic state?
izakaminska	712934989558583298	2016-03-24T09:32:01	wooglooskr silver/copper only became a medium of exchange when endorsed by a guarantor.
izakaminska	712934779046465536	2016-03-24T09:31:11	wooglooskr they did. Because they were usually coin of the realm. Give unto caesar that which is his.
izakaminska	712934279710445569	2016-03-24T09:29:12	izakaminska cc tylercowen The soda tax works because sugar in fizzy drinks has entirely different metabolic effects than it does in food.
izakaminska	712933935093850113	2016-03-24T09:27:50	wooglooskr here you go 
izakaminska	712933813614223360	2016-03-24T09:27:21	wooglooskr (i'm actually more of a historian. I can promise you gold was never a liquidity thing. Silver/copper always preferred as money)
izakaminska	712933622223872000	2016-03-24T09:26:35	wooglooskr exactly. And gold was a rubbish medium of exchange for that reason.
izakaminska	712933536332922880	2016-03-24T09:26:15	wooglooskr no prob. Always happy to engage in constructive/civilised debate. Also, i'm providing critique mostly because no-one else is
izakaminska	712933122766159872	2016-03-24T09:24:36	Yet again, economists butting into the soda sugar tax issue &amp; missing the science factor. It's not substitutable!  ?
izakaminska	712925087289180161	2016-03-24T08:52:40	wooglooskr it's almost never the dispute the factor. The issue is under-capitalisation and legit claims being unserviceable
izakaminska	712923691189936128	2016-03-24T08:47:08	cjenscook enjoy geneva airport. And all the ads of luxury watches and George Clooney.
izakaminska	712923404739993600	2016-03-24T08:45:59	wooglooskr the SDR accounts r publicly visible to everyone. Ledger controlled by IMF. If IMF was to change it, everyone would notice.
izakaminska	712923215170023425	2016-03-24T08:45:14	wooglooskr and BC doesn't create any commitment structures at all. It avoids the "legal" factor entirely.
izakaminska	712923040338874368	2016-03-24T08:44:32	wooglooskr it's about the capitalisation which supports the claim.
izakaminska	712922969421570048	2016-03-24T08:44:16	wooglooskr but your record doesn't have to exist in multiple places. Again the issue is never about the unprovability of the claim.
izakaminska	712922778194804736	2016-03-24T08:43:30	wooglooskr the risk has never been associated with the ledger keeping. It's always been associated with the capitalisation!
izakaminska	712920214481072128	2016-03-24T08:33:19	wooglooskr and that illusion creates a "no skin in the game" issue for the platform provider.
izakaminska	712920031412228096	2016-03-24T08:32:35	wooglooskr none of that makes the risk of the cost of capital go away. It's just a clever way of pretending it has
izakaminska	712919934582566912	2016-03-24T08:32:12	wooglooskr I disagree. It is a market structure based solution which only looks neutral because of the capital/risk  outsourcing
izakaminska	712918856881348608	2016-03-24T08:27:55	wooglooskr so basically they're more useful as a mechanism for cheap FX exchange for the MMs then as investable assets
izakaminska	712918721522700288	2016-03-24T08:27:23	wooglooskr yes but dumb investors end up funding the capital which supports the frictionless liquidity provision in the exchange
izakaminska	712918485488254976	2016-03-24T08:26:26	wooglooskr all you are doing here is providing an uncollateralized CCP solution for a bilateral FX mkt
izakaminska	712918268550516738	2016-03-24T08:25:35	wooglooskr OTC markets have always been P2P! And they use CCPs to inject trust. But ccp needs collateralisation for a reason

izakaminska	712917471741812736	2016-03-24T08:22:25	wooglooskr btw currency ETFs r equally stupid. Here cost of capital is outsourced to dumb investors who don't know how 2 use FX platforms
izakaminska	712917214740004864	2016-03-24T08:21:24	wooglooskr yes. If you deconstruct most of these things they r the same old same old with new marketing names
izakaminska	712917005884596224	2016-03-24T08:20:34	wooglooskr and btw the skin in the game factor is the problem with all the blockchain solutions. It creates rule by committee opacity
izakaminska	712916851790057473	2016-03-24T08:19:57	wooglooskr I don't see how outsourcing capital cost provision to outsiders makes it more trustworthy. No skin in the game
izakaminska	712916565218426880	2016-03-24T08:18:49	wooglooskr yes I spoke to the CEO at length. I will eventually do a story about this.
izakaminska	712916442161799168	2016-03-24T08:18:19	wooglooskr but there is no commitment here, which means the capital discounting MMs only come in when it's worth their while
izakaminska	712916122295775232	2016-03-24T08:17:03	wooglooskr if I can do a Jedi mind trick to get others to fund the cost of carrying idle float I can always look a genius
izakaminska	712915866619408384	2016-03-24T08:16:02	wooglooskr the same exact way uber does
izakaminska	712915818791759872	2016-03-24T08:15:51	wooglooskr and it's down to treating the capital costing side of a balance sheet as an inconvenience
izakaminska	712915613673500672	2016-03-24T08:15:02	wooglooskr and here they are bamboozling everyone by pretending they can operate without taking risk
izakaminska	712915498497871872	2016-03-24T08:14:34	wooglooskr a blockchain in this sense is just a euphemism for a balance sheet.
izakaminska	712915237306048513	2016-03-24T08:13:32	wooglooskr and every pivot makes them more like a standard fx platform and less reliant on the stupid bridging currency
izakaminska	712915138484023297	2016-03-24T08:13:08	wooglooskr in the world platform exchanges none of this is new. And btw they've pivoted a 100x to get here
izakaminska	712914958019903488	2016-03-24T08:12:25	wooglooskr all they've done is outsource it to select market counterparties.
izakaminska	712914829850320896	2016-03-24T08:11:55	wooglooskr they are being disingenuous by going around claiming to have solved the liquidity problem
izakaminska	712914723419865088	2016-03-24T08:11:30	wooglooskr and as we know uncommitted market maker liquidity tends to vaporize when things get tough
izakaminska	712914577567166464	2016-03-24T08:10:55	wooglooskr errrr not really. It's absolutely no different to a currency ETF. The resilience comes from the market makers
izakaminska	712914452287500288	2016-03-24T08:10:25	thickopedia they will either be using a proxy or a dollar dealing foreign bank.
izakaminska	712914189774356480	2016-03-24T08:09:22	thickopedia so where exactly do I send my dollars if I want to open a BTC-E account?! Surely not in an envelope
izakaminska	712914044840198144	2016-03-24T08:08:48	thickopedia not in Eurodollar. But in Bitcoin for it to be usually you need a conversion. Also money has to come in.
izakaminska	712913755923996672	2016-03-24T08:07:39	Wikisteff it's just all reinvention of the wheel for nothing more than security purposes.
izakaminska	712913650751840256	2016-03-24T08:07:14	Wikisteff thanks. But again we already hv such balancing currency it's called the SDR.
izakaminska	712913280096972801	2016-03-24T08:05:45	Wikisteff none of this is news to me
izakaminska	712913152397152257	2016-03-24T08:05:15	Wikisteff except instead of relying on a common counterparty they're melding all their software. Which is effectively be is akin to M&amp;A
izakaminska	712912946087796737	2016-03-24T08:04:26	Wikisteff those that waive those issues as unimportant or go "private" are just recreating bank cartel structures
izakaminska	712912776654675969	2016-03-24T08:03:45	Wikisteff the problems that affect BTC will affect other public blockchains. The issue is concentration and control
izakaminska	712912453923901442	2016-03-24T08:02:28	Wikisteff you're talking about private blockchains and I've written about this before. There's not a single working prototype
izakaminska	712912157978050560	2016-03-24T08:01:18	Wikisteff not convinced those don't suffer from exactly the same problems.
izakaminska	712911920588787712	2016-03-24T08:00:21	thickopedia but if I want to cash my BTC out on such an exchange for dollars they need access to dollar account or paper
izakaminska	712911123348070400	2016-03-24T07:57:11	wooglooskr it's really not that revolutionary. They've just turned an ordinary platform liability used for float into a "bridging currency"
izakaminska	712909491071815680	2016-03-24T07:50:42	wooglooskr yes I've looked at ripple and it's just an fx platform that outsources liquidity responsibility to markets
izakaminska	712797583169699841	2016-03-24T00:26:01	Wikisteff what do you mean?
izakaminska	712796731273056258	2016-03-24T00:22:38	TheAnalytic that link is leading to something very strange. :-/
izakaminska	712796511470485504	2016-03-24T00:21:46	TheAnalytic confused
izakaminska	712796288266452994	2016-03-24T00:20:52	TheAnalytic thank you
izakaminska	712795854164328448	2016-03-24T00:19:09	TheAnalytic very interesting! Do you have a further reading link on that?
izakaminska	712795648001761281	2016-03-24T00:18:20	izakaminska I'm thinking dollar accounts outside of US system or with actual physical cash?
izakaminska	712795214751080448	2016-03-24T00:16:36	izakaminska which does make one wonder how BTC exchanges w/out access to US bank accounts guarantee convertibility???
izakaminska	712795009762910208	2016-03-24T00:15:48	izakaminska with Bitcoin i guess convertibility is guaranteed by dollar cash reserves of Bitcoin exchanges. Aka dollar bank deposits
izakaminska	712794792732860417	2016-03-24T00:14:56	izakaminska although unlike Bitcoin, Eurodollar used to guarantee convertibility through the repo inventory in the system.
izakaminska	712794319900553216	2016-03-24T00:13:03	izakaminska to a bitcoiner.... Bitcoin being a new type of Eurodollar zero-reserve incarnation.
izakaminska	712794044833857538	2016-03-24T00:11:58	izakaminska it's old (Jan 16) but I came across it while trying to explain variability of offshore rates
izakaminska	712792146127024128	2016-03-24T00:04:25	This is excellent on the emergence &amp; transformation of the Eurodollar mkt into an unaccountable parallel fin system 
izakaminska	712791433938395136	2016-03-24T00:01:35	MashuriBC I'm not. You obviously don't understand how or what determines a positive rate of return in a cash flow stream
izakaminska	712791191897681922	2016-03-24T00:00:37	MashuriBC but since you're obviously a libertarian who thinks every man is an island I'm withdrawing from this conversation
izakaminska	712790992924094464	2016-03-23T23:59:50	MashuriBC because the government reg system is just a subsidisation system.
izakaminska	712790866386161664	2016-03-23T23:59:20	MashuriBC no. It's not the govt, it's the social construct which is something no system can escape.
izakaminska	712790682285580288	2016-03-23T23:58:36	MashuriBC the cash flow streams are variable. That's the point. Here educate yourself 
izakaminska	712790525758324736	2016-03-23T23:57:59	MashuriBC  you really don't seem to know the history and inner workings of the Eurodollar mkt, which was a precursor for all of this,
izakaminska	712787687980273665	2016-03-23T23:46:42	MashuriBC and we've been here before. It's called the Eurodollar market. Aka dollars that trade outside of the US regulated system.
izakaminska	712787503628099584	2016-03-23T23:45:58	MashuriBC ... Turns out it is no more frictionless than standing system, potentially less.
izakaminska	712787234596982784	2016-03-23T23:44:54	MashuriBC and in that sense it is an entirely self defeating clearing system. When protection layers r reintroduced ...
izakaminska	712786902164840448	2016-03-23T23:43:35	MashuriBC thus it is a mythos that Bitcoin is frictionless. Its frictionless state comes at cost of introducing predators to the Econ zone
izakaminska	712786541400162305	2016-03-23T23:42:09	MashuriBC frictions come about whenever you exchange cash flows from one set of productivity value sets to another
izakaminska	712786367026167808	2016-03-23T23:41:27	MashuriBC that friction exists for a reason: fair distribution of economic surplus to those who earned it.
izakaminska	712778325345902596	2016-03-23T23:09:30	Bootvis it would invert only with a significant hard currency deposit deposit. Premium for absolute privacy.
izakaminska	712778050451202048	2016-03-23T23:08:24	MashuriBC no I'm not. That's an entirely different risk based on entity capitalisation. This is about economic drag
izakaminska	712713238497136642	2016-03-23T18:50:52	MashuriBC and that is precisely why the Eurodollar trades at a discount to the dollar.
izakaminska	712713065947656192	2016-03-23T18:50:11	MashuriBC to the contrary mkts reward well run Econ systems w/ low predatory footprints over those badly run w/ with high predatory prints
izakaminska	712712643459547137	2016-03-23T18:48:30	t0nyyates if you extrapolate that to a mkt indicator of how robust KYC is at each exchange, it's only one part of the value creation story
izakaminska	712712201543487488	2016-03-23T18:46:45	t0nyyates tho if you are suggesting left to their own devices markets discount dark cash streams vs light ones, I agree.
izakaminska	712710729204367361	2016-03-23T18:40:54	t0nyyates partly disagree. People don't treat those streams as representative of a different economic profile.
izakaminska	712709100463906817	2016-03-23T18:34:25	t0nyyates all the euro mess we are in is because of the blurring of the lines of these subsidies as well.
izakaminska	712708542524964864	2016-03-23T18:32:12	MashuriBC no it's not. It's mkts, which always favour regulated jurisdictions which create/protect value over those which don't
izakaminska	712708087682113536	2016-03-23T18:30:24	t0nyyates we wisely keep them segregated, rather than fuse them into one giant cross subsidised currency stream
izakaminska	712707927119962113	2016-03-23T18:29:45	t0nyyates no it's exactly the same. But at least (apart from the Eurodollar mkts) we don't blur the lines between those cash flows
izakaminska	712706215986511872	2016-03-23T18:22:57	izakaminska aka bitcoins which trade outside of jurisdictions with strict KYC/AML rules are discounted vs those which do.
izakaminska	712705595749638144	2016-03-23T18:20:30	izakaminska at the same time fails to observe that the BTC-E discount is comparable to the "Eurodollar" discount.
izakaminska	712705362961514497	2016-03-23T18:19:34	In which NY Fed observes spread differential between Bitcoin exchanges and concludes Bitcoin is not so frictionless 
izakaminska	712603284473790464	2016-03-23T11:33:57	This Paul Tucker speech from Feb 24 (ICYMI) is worth your time 
izakaminska	712384475196432384	2016-03-22T21:04:29	DanielaGabor not really. It's just a temporal anomaly in cash claim allocation
izakaminska	712381822823321601	2016-03-22T20:53:56	DanielaGabor this is just a reflection of foreign cash claim demand on US economy which has to be funded by the demotion of other claims
izakaminska	712374119560511488	2016-03-22T20:23:20	Bjenkins120 mark_dow rszbt I worry about UST/cash balancing velocity
izakaminska	712200680564518912	2016-03-22T08:54:08	darioperkins tho we are also part of the pattern. In fact I may just shut up for the next 24hrs. Last thing anyone needs is spam
izakaminska	712200262249783296	2016-03-22T08:52:29	darioperkins and then there are tweets like this :-/ 
izakaminska	712199928810971136	2016-03-22T08:51:09	darioperkins next in the pattern: jesuisbrussels, Facebook safety check, false reports, westandtogether, Belgian flag
izakaminska	712199561570336769	2016-03-22T08:49:42	CuchetEric serves me right for ever trusting a Daily Mail tweet/headline.
izakaminska	712199352853381120	2016-03-22T08:48:52	darioperkins I am saddened that the social media response to these things is now so formulaic, predictable and "all about us" (the voyeurs)
izakaminska	712198612655202304	2016-03-22T08:45:55	Where apparently MailOnline fails to check authenticity of video and propagates one from Moscow in 2011 Brussels

izakaminska	711535623212027904	2016-03-20T12:51:26	Polybius, Anacyclosis and ochlocracy are gaining mainstream attention 
izakaminska	711177939426131968	2016-03-19T13:10:08	45d5f4caa6ea48c you know what. A lot of the trolls I encounter tend to be obsessed with justifying hoarding. Gold. Bitcoin. This case fat.
izakaminska	711168339515723776	2016-03-19T12:31:59	45d5f4caa6ea48c there's no point arguing with someone who is not open to looking at stats.
izakaminska	711168028776538113	2016-03-19T12:30:45	Rolo_Tamasi you popped up in my direct feed, making the accusation: so that stands to reason!
izakaminska	711167813889744896	2016-03-19T12:29:54	Rolo_Tamasi that's because of labeling laws, and thank god for that. But that's a recent innovation.
izakaminska	711167688844963840	2016-03-19T12:29:24	Rolo_Tamasi show me a sugar consumption chart which includes total sugar consumption incl sugar in natural juices, cereals and produce
izakaminska	711167518312939520	2016-03-19T12:28:43	Rolo_Tamasi  I calorie and sugar count every day. So I know exactly how much sugar is secretly embedded into products.
izakaminska	711166632119369728	2016-03-19T12:25:12	Rolo_Tamasi yes and please put up the methodology too. The anti sugar argument is more sugar is hidden, not added consciously.
izakaminska	711166168933990400	2016-03-19T12:23:22	Rolo_Tamasi so sugar increasingly arrives in imported goods. There are no UK stats that cover total sugar consumption.
izakaminska	711165775869026304	2016-03-19T12:21:48	Rolo_Tamasi those are figures for sugar as an independent input. But sugar has been embedded into the products. Stats don't unbundle that.
izakaminska	711162010457792512	2016-03-19T12:06:50	Rolo_Tamasi sorry I didn't engage you. You engaged first. Again, some disrespect there for the facts.
izakaminska	711161169936048128	2016-03-19T12:03:30	Rolo_Tamasi and I say flying fairies have an inverse correlation w/ barking dogs. Because without the supporting stats I can say anything.
izakaminska	711160492929228801	2016-03-19T12:00:48	Rolo_Tamasi well at this point I discontinue this conversation.
izakaminska	711159495775412224	2016-03-19T11:56:51	Rolo_Tamasi actually the science suggests otherwise. I urge u 2 watch RobertLustigMD 's game changing presentation

izakaminska	711130802046771200	2016-03-19T10:02:50	chattychd basically the option to spec a normal 911 in this way would lead to significantly fewer sales, and they'd all be different
izakaminska	711130520369930240	2016-03-19T10:01:42	chattychd this is interesting  suggests it's about creating a fungible standard purist model

izakaminska	711111426212012032	2016-03-19T08:45:50	izakaminska just kidding. I adore Bake Off precisely because it lets me indulge in sugar by proxy.
izakaminska	711111105599381504	2016-03-19T08:44:34	Though I suspect the real culprits to blame for the nation's sugar addiction are ...

izakaminska	711096913723002880	2016-03-19T07:48:10	chattychd yes. So most people by an avg depreciating Porsche, the VIPs get appreciating assets instead
izakaminska	711096640086663169	2016-03-19T07:47:05	chattychd probably because the intention is to create capital appreciating assets for select customers. But why?!?
izakaminska	711096075348791296	2016-03-19T07:44:50	chattychd I just don't understand why they don't raise the price to begin with?

izakaminska	710707170103455744	2016-03-18T05:59:28	dpinsen he was an extremist. He wanted to go from one extreme to the other.
izakaminska	710706911352659968	2016-03-18T05:58:26	dpinsen the issue is balance. SV is either radically leftist/communistic or radically libertarian/individualistic. There is no balance.
izakaminska	710706637451952128	2016-03-18T05:57:21	dpinsen central decisions are fine, providing they occur in a publicly accountable environment. Not behind closed doors.
izakaminska	710706482661203968	2016-03-18T05:56:44	dpinsen he wanted us to live in cabins and to never create social bonds, and hated the govt. hardly the same thing.
izakaminska	710706201831596036	2016-03-18T05:55:37	dpinsen to some degree yes. And not just VC. Conglomerisation.
izakaminska	710706020130156544	2016-03-18T05:54:54	dpinsen we do not have a debate about apps SV seems worthy of subsidisation for what they deem public good/future addiction
izakaminska	710705788285796352	2016-03-18T05:53:58	dpinsen we have a democratic process about what public spending should be undertaken for public good.
izakaminska	710705633432084480	2016-03-18T05:53:21	dpinsen if something is profitable it says people want it. Not profitable: it needs to be subsidised to be provided for our own good.
izakaminska	710705347493797889	2016-03-18T05:52:13	dpinsen no. Whether it's a company or govt makes no difference. It's passing something off as profitable when it isn't
izakaminska	710705072435568640	2016-03-18T05:51:08	dpinsen the issue is SV making choices on our behalf and then brain washing us into thinking we wanted them to begin with
izakaminska	710704894269857792	2016-03-18T05:50:25	dpinsen if society thru democracy transparently decides to ban/constrain X, that's fine.
izakaminska	710704765764816896	2016-03-18T05:49:55	dpinsen to be clear, I don't have prob w/ freedom losses such as sugar taxes. I have prob w/ ppl pretending loss of freedom as empowerment

izakaminska	710702415583035393	2016-03-18T05:40:34	dpinsen I suspect the libertarians are a counter movement to the open source/flat system focused tech hippies.
izakaminska	710701673488973824	2016-03-18T05:37:37	dpinsen I'm trying to understand how logicians rationalize this continuous contradiction and how this came about
izakaminska	710701381611610113	2016-03-18T05:36:28	dpinsen SV politics r convoluted/paradoxical, &amp; mostly an excuse 2 slip in radical commune-leaning policies under guise of libertarianism
izakaminska	710700642726252544	2016-03-18T05:33:32	dpinsen tax spending on the other hand is at least publicly scrutinized and held accountable to the electoral process.
izakaminska	710700384818470913	2016-03-18T05:32:30	dpinsen that's the irony. It's some central process at Google which decides how better they can "invest" the money rather than pay taxes.
izakaminska	710700081947799552	2016-03-18T05:31:18	dpinsen well it is. Google is a mini command economy. As is Amazon. The execs are central planners.

izakaminska	710698880170631169	2016-03-18T05:26:31	dpinsen the issue isn't just central planning, it's centralised subsidisation based on views of boards/committees ..

izakaminska	707535162482008064	2016-03-09T11:55:02	PaulJDavies micro insurance makes the risk much harder to hedge/diversify i would have thought.
izakaminska	707213123741212672	2016-03-08T14:35:22	Wolf_InTheWilds I am extremely familiar with the Merc/Citi deal, and that I would argue is besides the point to the overall effect.
izakaminska	707202226817736704	2016-03-08T13:52:04	Wolf_InTheWilds point is it's the financier who takes ownership of the collateral who hedges the commods, not the cash borrower.
izakaminska	707201678777434112	2016-03-08T13:49:54	Wolf_InTheWilds when Citi lost its phys collateral in Quingdao scandal, it retained the deriv exposure.
izakaminska	707201359846760448	2016-03-08T13:48:38	Wolf_InTheWilds The derivs are bundled into the trade by the foreign counterparty, not the chinese operator.
izakaminska	707200964256780290	2016-03-08T13:47:03	Wolf_InTheWilds This is simply not true, the aim here was outright speculation from outset, on exchange rate and commod price
izakaminska	707200294900396032	2016-03-08T13:44:24	Wolf_InTheWilds there was plenty of price action. Hence the bullish effect on commods. This was outright position taking!
izakaminska	707199735342436353	2016-03-08T13:42:10	Wolf_InTheWilds do see the case of Mercuria vs Citi.
izakaminska	707199696528392192	2016-03-08T13:42:01	Wolf_InTheWilds no i didn't. There was no CME hedge. Or the embedded derivs were taken out by the financier.
izakaminska	707199424229937152	2016-03-08T13:40:56	Wolf_InTheWilds a lot of the time there wasn't a copper hedge. Whole thing structured as a buyback, expectation 4 it to be rolled
izakaminska	707198508059729920	2016-03-08T13:37:18	drenerbas Jim_Edwards that insensitive market is not large enough to make this economic. That's the point. Hence Concorde.
izakaminska	707198370138480641	2016-03-08T13:36:45	Wolf_InTheWilds the heart of the issue is that the collateral was technically overvalued in dollar terms to begin with.
izakaminska	707198170355388416	2016-03-08T13:35:57	Wolf_InTheWilds the dollar short creates a mismatch which can only prevent RMB depreciation by the dumping of reserve dollars into system
izakaminska	707197782793256960	2016-03-08T13:34:25	Wolf_InTheWilds the trade has an FX reserve impact because when it goes the WRONG way, the carry traders are left SHORT dollars.
izakaminska	707197445881597952	2016-03-08T13:33:04	Wolf_InTheWilds there is a flow, because of the HKMA channel.
izakaminska	707196977549852672	2016-03-08T13:31:13	drenerbas Jim_Edwards and if you're using Uber as a substitute for your own car, you're even more price sensitive.
izakaminska	707196648309583872	2016-03-08T13:29:54	drenerbas Jim_Edwards having the urban population transport itself around in taxis is never going to be as economic as mass transport
izakaminska	707196454536921089	2016-03-08T13:29:08	drenerbas Jim_Edwards When prices go up, ppl will start taking bus or the train again.
izakaminska	707196221060939776	2016-03-08T13:28:12	Wolf_InTheWilds the frauds came along when the carry trade began to breakdown because the commod collateral started losing value.
izakaminska	707195999413002240	2016-03-08T13:27:19	Wolf_InTheWilds Yes I appreciate that. But the whole point of the trade is the anticipated mismatch between the two components
izakaminska	707195608814243841	2016-03-08T13:25:46	Wolf_InTheWilds whole point of the carry trade (alongside RMB yield) is exposure to what was until recently guaranteed RMB appreciation.
izakaminska	707195104600190976	2016-03-08T13:23:46	drenerbas Jim_Edwards the Uber price hasn't gone up significantly enough. If it got to breakeven cost there would be substitution.
izakaminska	707194843399897089	2016-03-08T13:22:44	Wolf_InTheWilds and in some cases they double-pledge the same collateral as well, and double monetise it.
izakaminska	707194740404572160	2016-03-08T13:22:19	Wolf_InTheWilds And they do monetise collateral onshore, that's the whole point.
izakaminska	707194405350989824	2016-03-08T13:20:59	Wolf_InTheWilds there is, because of the FX rate effect. The band has to be actively policed by the PBoC.
izakaminska	707194098676060161	2016-03-08T13:19:46	drenerbas Jim_Edwards well, I totally disagree with that. Uber's model thrives on the exploitation of drivers.
izakaminska	707193905251536896	2016-03-08T13:19:00	drenerbas Jim_Edwards we can all take the convenience 4 granted 4 as long as it's subsidised. Doesn't make it economic on standalone basis
izakaminska	707193636589576192	2016-03-08T13:17:56	drenerbas Jim_Edwards if you were to get people to pay what it really costs to provide this service, it would create a Concord effect
izakaminska	707193510563356672	2016-03-08T13:17:26	drenerbas Jim_Edwards the point is the delivery priced do not reflect the true cost of provision due to subsidisation.
izakaminska	707193311325462528	2016-03-08T13:16:39	drenerbas Jim_Edwards we are all prepared to pay for a luxury every now and then, not so much on a regular basis
izakaminska	707192669286567936	2016-03-08T13:14:06	drenerbas Jim_Edwards i suspect the fact that people are happy to use an uneconomic service is besides the point.
izakaminska	707192522616008704	2016-03-08T13:13:31	Wolf_InTheWilds there are many incarnations of this trade, but the core consequence is RMB support vs the USD.
izakaminska	707191873195155457	2016-03-08T13:10:56	Wolf_InTheWilds The collateral is funded on dollar-denominated credit and used to raise RMB with a clear basis swap exposure.
izakaminska	707191329265156096	2016-03-08T13:08:46	Wolf_InTheWilds It absolutely does. because it contributes to the inflow of dollars into the onshore mkt and its conversion into RMB.
izakaminska	707191190421168128	2016-03-08T13:08:13	Wolf_InTheWilds The PBoC's $ sterilisation policy doesn't discriminate between borrowed $ or earned $. And effects 4 reserves are the same
izakaminska	707190903933378561	2016-03-08T13:07:05	Wolf_InTheWilds Of course it impacts reserves. Because dollars are raised and swapped into RMB and reinvested in higher yielding RMB assets
izakaminska	707190705387642885	2016-03-08T13:06:17	Wolf_InTheWilds .. that things have got exacerbated. But it's not a coincidence that the unwind coincides with metal weakness &amp; commodchaos
izakaminska	707190474407284737	2016-03-08T13:05:22	Wolf_InTheWilds It's because it's been misinterpreted as an prtflo outflow rather than the unwind of a MULTI-yr commod collateral trade...
izakaminska	707190134748356608	2016-03-08T13:04:01	Wolf_InTheWilds When it was shut down in LATE 2014, the unwind began. That's my whole point.
izakaminska	707190066012102656	2016-03-08T13:03:45	Wolf_InTheWilds again, this trade can be replicated in inventory, commods or almost anything store-able.
izakaminska	707189793894109184	2016-03-08T13:02:40	Wolf_InTheWilds It works like this 
izakaminska	707189736079757313	2016-03-08T13:02:26	Wolf_InTheWilds the fake invoices just one part of story. This trade mostly financed via commodity collateral stashed in bonded warehouses
izakaminska	707189396408295424	2016-03-08T13:01:05	Wolf_InTheWilds These aren't "fake invoices". These are a melange of collateral repo trades, and LC funded carry trades.
izakaminska	707189194574135298	2016-03-08T13:00:17	Wolf_InTheWilds Not necessarily, because this was all done via the freeport system, with collateral kept outside of domestic territory
izakaminska	707188883893657600	2016-03-08T12:59:03	Wolf_InTheWilds this has been a primary mechanism for playing the dollar funding trade thing since 2009.
izakaminska	707188738766540800	2016-03-08T12:58:28	Wolf_InTheWilds and ever since then, the carry trade has been unwinding, and w/ it surplus commod 4 collateral demand.
izakaminska	707188356237684736	2016-03-08T12:56:57	Wolf_InTheWilds the point is that this was a major way to get dollar carry trade exposure since 2008. It was nipped in the bud in 2015
izakaminska	707188124984545282	2016-03-08T12:56:02	Wolf_InTheWilds well yes, in line w/ the PBOC objective to rein this sort of stuff in. Hence the unwind! This was clearly expressed in '14
izakaminska	707187023879282688	2016-03-08T12:51:40	Wolf_InTheWilds and that's because importers have special dispensation for dollar accounts and exchange for CNY.
izakaminska	707186802059300868	2016-03-08T12:50:47	Wolf_InTheWilds Yes, I know that. But the whole point here is that dollar for CNY exchange can creep into the system via trade/collateral
izakaminska	707186509506592768	2016-03-08T12:49:37	HSBC's bold call on online grocery delivery  (FTAV team was debating this v. thing internally last week)
izakaminska	707174771591684097	2016-03-08T12:02:58	Wolf_InTheWilds offshore feeds into onshore via the RMB yield and commod LC game. So not entirely sure about that.
izakaminska	707162317830619136	2016-03-08T11:13:29	Wolf_InTheWilds it has as Pettis has noted led to a temp technical overvaluation not a fundamental one.
izakaminska	707156270822907909	2016-03-08T10:49:27	Wolf_InTheWilds I'm not sure about that. But I guess we shall see. I'm not a China bear, I'm a China pragmatist.
izakaminska	707156002613927937	2016-03-08T10:48:24	Wolf_InTheWilds i agree. That's why I think the carry trade unwind is key.
izakaminska	707155811240448000	2016-03-08T10:47:38	Wolf_InTheWilds but my point is that qualified investor outflows are actually desirable. Not a problem
izakaminska	707144643155197952	2016-03-08T10:03:15	Wolf_InTheWilds dasvee DanielaGabor BaldingsWorld err no. That's my point. FDI not an issue &amp; foreign portfl positions were cap cntrld
izakaminska	707141656529772546	2016-03-08T09:51:23	Wolf_InTheWilds dasvee DanielaGabor BaldingsWorld carry unwind began end of 2014 and was actively encouraged by PBOC
izakaminska	707141317139308544	2016-03-08T09:50:02	Wolf_InTheWilds dasvee DanielaGabor BaldingsWorld I'm not entirely convinced that's a bad thing. It allows for more diversification
izakaminska	707141220603203584	2016-03-08T09:49:39	Wolf_InTheWilds dasvee DanielaGabor BaldingsWorld what were once foreign assets owned by state become privately owned foreign assets
izakaminska	707140987282395137	2016-03-08T09:48:44	Wolf_InTheWilds dasvee DanielaGabor BaldingsWorld also, aside from any FDI reversal outflows mainly represent a public to private swap
izakaminska	707140653839486976	2016-03-08T09:47:24	Wolf_InTheWilds dasvee DanielaGabor BaldingsWorld there very well may be at this point, but my hunch is it didn't start off this way
izakaminska	707139773832503300	2016-03-08T09:43:54	BaldingsWorld boundryrunner DanielaGabor we are all just trying to make sense of this murky and opaque situation
izakaminska	707139505736847360	2016-03-08T09:42:50	Wolf_InTheWilds dasvee DanielaGabor BaldingsWorld just coz BIS doesn't capture entire thing doesnt mean carry trade unwind not the issue
izakaminska	707139092509806592	2016-03-08T09:41:12	Wolf_InTheWilds dasvee DanielaGabor BaldingsWorld agree. The stats show a teeny tiny window into the bigger picture.
izakaminska	707136977599143936	2016-03-08T09:32:48	BaldingsWorld DanielaGabor obviously the dollar debt pay down is only one factor, the issue is whether it influenced other factors
izakaminska	707136341478400001	2016-03-08T09:30:16	ramonbloomberg haha :) will have to watch that indicator.
izakaminska	707135991157493760	2016-03-08T09:28:52	DanielaGabor BaldingsWorld ... A fear induced rush for the exits.
izakaminska	707135888552284161	2016-03-08T09:28:28	DanielaGabor BaldingsWorld but the data does provide us with a snippet of the real situation. An unwinding carry trade isnt same as..
izakaminska	707135612093120512	2016-03-08T09:27:22	DanielaGabor BaldingsWorld nobody is suggesting BIS observation equates to the whole carry trade (which is based on dollar indebtedness)
izakaminska	707135369771405312	2016-03-08T09:26:24	DanielaGabor BaldingsWorld  that most of the carry trade wasn't captured in xborder stats doesn't mean unwind doesn't equate to $ payback
izakaminska	706925128777601026	2016-03-07T19:30:59	zkim229 shucks. Will try to minimize in that case.
izakaminska	706606119687462913	2016-03-06T22:23:21	jmuller dgwbirch and btw, by offering credit they become pseudo banks, and lose their transmission agent status.
izakaminska	706605967849431041	2016-03-06T22:22:45	jmuller dgwbirch those subsidises are no longer as healthy as they used to be. To avoid hiking fees they hv no choice but 2 go into credit
izakaminska	706605758541078528	2016-03-06T22:21:55	jmuller dgwbirch and it's there very clearly in the original paypal docs and in their risk factors
izakaminska	706605674260787200	2016-03-06T22:21:35	jmuller dgwbirch Yes, they make money from tx fee. But they also used to massively supplement those fees with interest rates from float.
izakaminska	706600269895876609	2016-03-06T22:00:06	tradewithdave i have no idea what that means. Prepay can't cover the float. u have 2 hv private sector reinvestment or u end up w/ gosplan
izakaminska	706599867313950721	2016-03-06T21:58:31	dgwbirch you can't have the public sector be responsible for all money creation-focused wealth distribution. It's like insurance
izakaminska	706599685960634368	2016-03-06T21:57:47	dgwbirch if you take the banks out of the picture you have to back every liability with a liquid asset which is basically impossible
izakaminska	706599550618902528	2016-03-06T21:57:15	dgwbirch Dave the point is that the cash float is the net differential of all liabilities/assets that square off.
izakaminska	706598963420463108	2016-03-06T21:54:55	dgwbirch errr ... No. There is an RWA component these days. But previously no. It was loan book.
izakaminska	706598657181745153	2016-03-06T21:53:42	dgwbirch &amp; btw that's the reason y we have neg rates. There aren't enough gilts to cover the float. So unless you want endless govt debt..
izakaminska	706598248149094400	2016-03-06T21:52:04	dgwbirch it's easier to create your own assets to back the float when there is a scarcity of other people's safe assets.
izakaminska	706598131677446144	2016-03-06T21:51:37	dgwbirch hence why MMFs are busting the buck and why orgs like PayPal are moving into credit provision.
izakaminska	706598026362691586	2016-03-06T21:51:12	dgwbirch but there simply aren't enough liquid low risk securities to park the nation's entire float in them. That's the core issue today!
izakaminska	706597827049349120	2016-03-06T21:50:24	dgwbirch the deposits have to be invested in something. Narrow banking invests the float (like PayPal or MMFS) in liquid securities.
izakaminska	706597570047569921	2016-03-06T21:49:23	dgwbirch offbalancetweet but this confused shop assistants so they had to put the silly symbol on the cards anyway
izakaminska	706597469895970816	2016-03-06T21:48:59	dgwbirch offbalancetweet yes they've always had accounts. They used to have debit cards from BoE without a check guarantee symbol.
izakaminska	706597267923410944	2016-03-06T21:48:11	dgwbirch offbalancetweet the float has to be invested in something. One party should not make these decisions alone. Hence banks.
izakaminska	706597099819962368	2016-03-06T21:47:31	dgwbirch offbalancetweet that's not really the issue Dave. The issue is the Neg feedback loops of centralised float management
izakaminska	706593534267228160	2016-03-06T21:33:21	tyillc I don't really agree but perhaps this isn't a conversation for Twitter.
izakaminska	706593266934935553	2016-03-06T21:32:17	offbalancetweet dgwbirch I don't think the public having cbank accounts helps anyone with anything btw.
izakaminska	706593152082300928	2016-03-06T21:31:49	offbalancetweet dgwbirch they do, but I believe they've been reducing the number of these accounts recently. I think I read that somewhere
izakaminska	706556439100301312	2016-03-06T19:05:56	colingplatt if you have to read the T&amp;Cs of every single thing to ensure you're not be conned, you'd never do anything.
izakaminska	706556357873438721	2016-03-06T19:05:37	colingplatt and liquidity is needed to make trade happen at a rate that suits our pace of life.
izakaminska	706556260812980228	2016-03-06T19:05:14	colingplatt the point here is precisely that without someone insuring the network, or taking risk, liquidity grinds to a halt.
izakaminska	706556110157844481	2016-03-06T19:04:38	colingplatt yes i know. And he's raising the point that there is a lot economists who think that's highly dangerous.
izakaminska	706550004396249088	2016-03-06T18:40:22	tyillc it thus runs contrary to division of labour economic scaling. If i'm a tennis coach, i shouldnt have to worry about money quality.
izakaminska	706549872544104449	2016-03-06T18:39:51	tyillc because everyone has to do due diligence since there's no one willing to guarantee stupid decisions for you.
izakaminska	706549797583458304	2016-03-06T18:39:33	tyillc as for liquidity, I think there's a good argument that overt transparency with no guarantee clogs the system
izakaminska	706549652506746881	2016-03-06T18:38:58	tyillc and i can make plenty of stupid decisions if i don't have the bandwidth to process the info.
izakaminska	706549585771155458	2016-03-06T18:38:42	tyillc Well, I'm not so sure about that. Just because the info is out there doesn't mean it's been processed.
izakaminska	706549422587551744	2016-03-06T18:38:04	tradewithdave money has to have a credit component because that's what money is: an insurance platform
izakaminska	706549243172036608	2016-03-06T18:37:21	tradewithdave prepaid can't reflect the whole system, because it's tantamount to stock (which is subject to depreciation)
izakaminska	706545898025787392	2016-03-06T18:24:03	tyillc there's also the countervailing view that perfect transparency is impossible... nor advisable for liquidity.
izakaminska	706543090828451841	2016-03-06T18:12:54	I think the key issue that a lot of the digital enthusiasts don't get, which Broadbent flags, is this one: 
izakaminska	706541995985145856	2016-03-06T18:08:33	Finally caught up on this Broadbent piece on digital money (h/t dgwbirch )  Worth a read. Raises many good points.

izakaminska	705962452446552064	2016-03-05T03:45:39	junseth oh yes. Couldn't agree more. But again this is how we end up with a tutorial for why current system works how it does.
izakaminska	705962135315193857	2016-03-05T03:44:23	Matbythesea junseth sorry, but you can't solve the under serviced problem with a strategy that amounts to charity.
izakaminska	705961840187219968	2016-03-05T03:43:13	junseth i don't have a problem with coinbase charging a fee. The hypocrisy is they clear through off chain netting.
izakaminska	705961696939143169	2016-03-05T03:42:39	junseth to be fair NIRP in real world is the result of decades of cross-subsidizing strategies which under priced true cost of deposits
izakaminska	705959946400169984	2016-03-05T03:35:41	junseth bitcoin's much bigger problem is that it's repeating the Asian Financial crisis mistake. Capital inflows eventually run out.
izakaminska	705959708545458176	2016-03-05T03:34:45	junseth there's getting rich and then there's just breaking even and not depending on endless capital inflows.
izakaminska	705959324657520640	2016-03-05T03:33:13	junseth coinbase is the archetypal hypocrisy of the whole movement and always was. (Goldman Sachs of Bitcoin)
izakaminska	705959103089287168	2016-03-05T03:32:20	junseth lots of crazy things work on a small scale but have no ability to scale because of lack of education, custom or inefficiency.
izakaminska	705958810146488320	2016-03-05T03:31:11	junseth yes. And I would agree. But this was kinda obvious from the outset.
izakaminska	705958628080164864	2016-03-05T03:30:27	junseth but you have to admit there was a lot of militancy/conversion/moon "we will overcome" vitriolic-based campaigning AND investing!
izakaminska	705958354586361856	2016-03-05T03:29:22	junseth if you're suggesting Bitcoin was only ever supposed to be a small scale boutique product... Fine.
izakaminska	705958074457128960	2016-03-05T03:28:15	junseth that might be the case, but I'm not convinced an admission that you can't have the perfect system helps anyone either
izakaminska	705957861524905984	2016-03-05T03:27:24	junseth we've always know the financial system can't be perfect. And right now what we hv with Bitcoin is a worse system than standing one
izakaminska	705957697653444608	2016-03-05T03:26:45	junseth the more realistic you get, and admit there is no perfect financial system, the more it reduces the whole thing to a waste of time
izakaminska	705957521257848832	2016-03-05T03:26:03	junseth sadly, the Bitcoin mythos was always (to us establishment cronies) based on proposition you had perfected the financial structure
izakaminska	705957149944504320	2016-03-05T03:24:35	junseth and from an external perspective, there's a lot of schadenfreude here because the realistic element just looks like a cop out.
izakaminska	705956716769316864	2016-03-05T03:22:51	junseth to be fair I think the realistic pragmatic part of the community isn't. But there is a core idealistic side which doesn't.
izakaminska	705956404365037569	2016-03-05T03:21:37	junseth he says in the piece that the high IQ developers want nothing short of perfection. This fits w/ my experience of some Bitcoin ppl
izakaminska	705955858384068609	2016-03-05T03:19:27	junseth 
izakaminska	705955147638251520	2016-03-05T03:16:37	junseth to be fair the vulnerability of systems which demand perfection is a longstanding concept. More recently also expressed in Tron

izakaminska	705843621338206209	2016-03-04T19:53:27	kltblom that's the issue. It's much easier to break promises to people you don't have to look in the eye.

izakaminska	705195736841981953	2016-03-03T00:59:00	indysmith the irony is that the current system is actually pretty decentralized as it stands.

izakaminska	698436968196268032	2016-02-13T09:22:04	cjenscook the unit of account can't be fixed. That's the issue.
izakaminska	698436822020583424	2016-02-13T09:21:29	cjenscook we have this already though. IMF and BIS
izakaminska	698436575357702144	2016-02-13T09:20:30	BaldingsWorld precisely. This is all down to a mis-estimation of their appeal to foreign hot money investors. As opposed to FDI
izakaminska	698436131361333248	2016-02-13T09:18:44	cjenscook I'd argue 2 b efficient money has to be both backward looking (check the value isn't fake) and fwd looking (invest 2 protect par)
izakaminska	698435809519759360	2016-02-13T09:17:27	BaldingsWorld yup. It also just encourages value to be removed via real goods/commods/human capital rather than in money form.
izakaminska	698435407181123584	2016-02-13T09:15:52	BaldingsWorld isn't the real issue that they wrongly assumed that liberalization wd encourage more inflows than it really is doing?
izakaminska	698435123985915904	2016-02-13T09:14:44	BaldingsWorld clemtan I'd also argue a lot of the outflows are happening through legitimate channels (part of qualified investor route)
izakaminska	698434741540888576	2016-02-13T09:13:13	BaldingsWorld clemtan I used to think that. But all it does is bifurcates society and encourages parallel shadow networks
izakaminska	698434579913379840	2016-02-13T09:12:34	cjenscook they focus only on the past participle of money failing to recognize money had to be backward &amp; forward looking to be successful
izakaminska	698434189755080704	2016-02-13T09:11:01	cjenscook but I also don't see why we need a global currency either. We need at most a global BoP squaring currency, which we have. The SDR
izakaminska	698433983055532032	2016-02-13T09:10:12	cjenscook yes. Absolutely agree. It all links back to fixed abode factors.

izakaminska	698423505113767936	2016-02-13T08:28:34	went1955 remittance challenge is a risk and independence challenge. Remittances wd be cheaper if EMs had more independence not less.
izakaminska	698422872356876288	2016-02-13T08:26:03	went1955 I'd add it totally misses the remittance challenge as well, which is about risk management.

izakaminska	695027621596381185	2016-02-03T23:34:32	oditorium are you trying to say that since a new entrant can't raise cheap equity it has no choice but to deweight its RWA?
izakaminska	695021057451900929	2016-02-03T23:08:27	oditorium it also renders you entirely dependent on credit evaluation capacity of mkt not internal procedures
izakaminska	695020924228206594	2016-02-03T23:07:55	oditorium &amp; shipping in AAA floating or fixed in a low rate environment exposes you to either unexpected risk levels or spread compression
izakaminska	695020553644679168	2016-02-03T23:06:27	oditorium but that's besides the point. The point of the article is they r importing assets not creating them
izakaminska	695020297142063105	2016-02-03T23:05:26	oditorium which it is either way!
izakaminska	695020032099803137	2016-02-03T23:04:23	oditorium and my point is that if you carry float you replace op cost with credit exposure
izakaminska	695019766826803200	2016-02-03T23:03:19	oditorium I have no idea what you are showing here.

izakaminska	695018822563205121	2016-02-03T22:59:34	oditorium I only saw a ref to AAA in the accounts I saw. But RMBS AAA floating is a non sequitur
izakaminska	695018460582010881	2016-02-03T22:58:08	ManeeshJuneja no because I don't like the world hearing my thought process

izakaminska	695017942388469760	2016-02-03T22:56:04	oditorium that's the point.
izakaminska	695017794333704192	2016-02-03T22:55:29	1867ben it is utterly paradoxical.
izakaminska	695017699244691456	2016-02-03T22:55:06	1867ben errr no. Banks are security guards for value. You can't lower barriers without lowering defences

izakaminska	695016241497575424	2016-02-03T22:49:19	oditorium there are enough floating rate notes to ensure this is true. Banks buy normal notes and hedge with swaps

izakaminska	695010590620835840	2016-02-03T22:26:52	In that context is sandbox a euphemism 4  "loophole", "controlled loophole" or "loophole that we could extend to others if nobody notices"?

izakaminska	693023287371264005	2016-01-29T10:50:02	jonmatonis bank cartels are inherent to the system, without them you can't have financial scaling.
izakaminska	693022808406818816	2016-01-29T10:48:07	jonmatonis and not without introducing massive delays to the clearing system
izakaminska	693022727553335299	2016-01-29T10:47:48	jonmatonis not without the global economy spending more on managing the blockchain than on actually creating output.

izakaminska	693016120349962240	2016-01-29T10:21:33	prestonjbyrne hashingitcom you end up in an Alpha60 universe (see pinned tweet)
izakaminska	693016020831744000	2016-01-29T10:21:09	prestonjbyrne hashingitcom but I don't think that that should necessarily be a goal
izakaminska	693015805999583233	2016-01-29T10:20:18	prestonjbyrne hashingitcom I think we are at point where growth is suppressed in scaling terms w/out further synchronization
izakaminska	693015341987926016	2016-01-29T10:18:27	prestonjbyrne hashingitcom but there are limits to synchronization.
izakaminska	693015246982758400	2016-01-29T10:18:05	prestonjbyrne hashingitcom I like this idea that civilisation emerged musically. Ability to work cooperatively in synchronized beat...
izakaminska	693015087804735490	2016-01-29T10:17:27	prestonjbyrne hashingitcom I'm also not convinced it solves the problem of non synchronization

izakaminska	693007764499623937	2016-01-29T09:48:21	@lchikako ooooh. How come not the fed? One of the key temporal discrepancies was w/ dollar fx i noticed
izakaminska	693005432575623168	2016-01-29T09:39:05	JeremyWarnerUK the system needs slack.
izakaminska	693005375365341184	2016-01-29T09:38:51	JeremyWarnerUK I don't think blockchain will reduce any of the temporal risk or cost. I think it will make it worse.
izakaminska	693005091897483264	2016-01-29T09:37:43	hashingitcom yes well I think just doubling up makes the point. But def appreciate the point
izakaminska	693004841581436928	2016-01-29T09:36:44	JeremyWarnerUK errr. I'm not a convert

izakaminska	693004668893552640	2016-01-29T09:36:03	izakaminska the banks will be slow but they will at least always all have seats.
izakaminska	693004572718153728	2016-01-29T09:35:40	izakaminska but netting carries its own risks. It's efficient but deadly w/ respect to last man standing without a seat risk
izakaminska	693004385887109121	2016-01-29T09:34:55	izakaminska which is why fintech systems r largely outcompeting banks by discovering the "magic" of netting.
izakaminska	693004220811853824	2016-01-29T09:34:16	What we have learnt is that a real-time gross system is economically expensive in terms of prefunding op cost if it's to avoid systemic risk
izakaminska	693003091340365832	2016-01-29T09:29:47	@lchikako except RTGS exposed the limits cbank control, by pushing risk into collateral markets.
izakaminska	693001814447374336	2016-01-29T09:24:42	izakaminska I'm starting to think it's a diminishing return problem.
izakaminska	693001580975636481	2016-01-29T09:23:46	izakaminska but I'm not convinced blockchain can create best of both worlds. Batching and gross
izakaminska	693001201999306753	2016-01-29T09:22:16	izakaminska just formalise decentralized verification processes already going on.
izakaminska	693001042804482049	2016-01-29T09:21:38	izakaminska hence why blockchain would not technically replace a centralised system at all
izakaminska	693000889523634176	2016-01-29T09:21:02	izakaminska what I underestimated in my criticism of blockchain is degree to which banks already double up on verification/costs...

izakaminska	691173523566518272	2016-01-24T08:19:44	Inthegorsebush no. My call was always that everything PBOC was doing was response to this underlying issue
izakaminska	691173277289598976	2016-01-24T08:18:45	CardiffGarcia how is that snow blizzard going?
izakaminska	691173117226541056	2016-01-24T08:18:07	agscribbler MarkHar13514700 but ppl also forget that a lot of the productive assets in China are actually owned by foreigners (FDI)
izakaminska	691172890864128000	2016-01-24T08:17:13	agscribbler MarkHar13514700 yes it's the phantom black hole argument. Technically I agree.
izakaminska	691172107510759424	2016-01-24T08:14:06	Who wants another post Davos rant? (I've got at least two more but I know there's only so much D the world can take)
izakaminska	691171824248475648	2016-01-24T08:12:58	JohnRoss43 no
izakaminska	691171612813557761	2016-01-24T08:12:08	agscribbler MarkHar13514700 you are referring to the black hole in the balance of payments coz of devaluation skews?
izakaminska	691171469175427072	2016-01-24T08:11:34	agscribbler MarkHar13514700 please expand on the point? I think I understand what you are getting at but want to be clear
izakaminska	691170717807874048	2016-01-24T08:08:35	bauhiniacapital and yet the wider market doesn't half opine a lot about stuff is doesn't know. Often in a very rude derisive manner
izakaminska	691170483975405569	2016-01-24T08:07:39	BFFEIN not really the point. Point is that having diversified private capital owners invest Chinese surplus diminishes elephant effect
izakaminska	691170154055622656	2016-01-24T08:06:20	izakaminska on that note, I'd be more worried about Switzerland which already has the bulk of its current ac surplus in private hands
izakaminska	691169640664408064	2016-01-24T08:04:18	My absolutely last point on Chinese cap outflows is that they mainly represent a public/private China asset switch.
izakaminska	691169359239184384	2016-01-24T08:03:11	RMB roll call is about those who realised that 4 China to be a more mkt-based economy, those reserves wd have to be unwound via FX pressures
izakaminska	691168891167457281	2016-01-24T08:01:19	Last of all, the RMB Cassandra roll call is not the same as a China bear case roll call. The bear case not yet proven at all.
izakaminska	691168521884143616	2016-01-24T07:59:51	alialsalim it's way too early to say if bear case is proven. The RMB issue is removed from the bear case
izakaminska	691168363905703936	2016-01-24T07:59:13	alialsalim this isn't a roll call of China bears. This is not a bear story. This is a RMB valuation story
izakaminska	691168196888547328	2016-01-24T07:58:34	alialsalim high hendry's analysis rested on general overcapacity issues. Not the specifics of the RMB framework.
izakaminska	691167962737307648	2016-01-24T07:57:38	izakaminska five years of PBOC counter repositioning in a bid to stop the inevitable has however now failed.
izakaminska	691167832529334272	2016-01-24T07:57:07	Last of all, I want to stress the forces which started this can be traced to Dec 11. 
izakaminska	691166921794916352	2016-01-24T07:53:30	C) it's the analysis, stupid. In the face of overwhelming "but the fx money pile is still growing" retaliatory commentary.
izakaminska	691166639442784256	2016-01-24T07:52:22	B) apart from sector specialists nobody in wider mkt understood the significance and ETF-like structure of the CNH-CNY corridor.
izakaminska	691166236974120960	2016-01-24T07:50:46	A) this analysis wasn't focus on trade recommendations. These were explainers of what the RMB framework rested on.
izakaminska	691166017582686208	2016-01-24T07:49:54	Now to all the market timing "traders" with their predictable stopped clock assertions...
izakaminska	691165856886317057	2016-01-24T07:49:16	There are probably more, but those are the ones I noted. I remember cause saying this back then invited much derisory feedback.

izakaminska	691163707049648128	2016-01-24T07:40:43	My roll call of largely uncredited, sometimes derided, lone voices on RMB valuation: no 1, Jim Chanos. 
izakaminska	691162630459899904	2016-01-24T07:36:26	That was the contextual preamble. Here's the Chanos quote

izakaminska	691161687261646848	2016-01-24T07:32:42	In the spirit of giving credit where it is due, here's what Chanos was saying in 2012!

izakaminska	691160820844199936	2016-01-24T07:29:15	izakaminska I remember because when I came up with the analysis myself, I did many google searches seeking ppl w/similar concerns
izakaminska	691160584314863616	2016-01-24T07:28:19	izakaminska absolutely NOBODY was registering this. APART FROM Jim Chanos 
izakaminska	691160432376156160	2016-01-24T07:27:42	This year's key talking point was RMB depreciation risk. I just want to stress that in 2012 (when this phenomenon can be traced back to)...

izakaminska	689957631948124161	2016-01-20T23:48:12	dgwbirch good point. Link here 
izakaminska	689940772783833088	2016-01-20T22:41:13	jtmoneyfosho nice trolling. You're now on mute.
izakaminska	689940675975057409	2016-01-20T22:40:50	jtmoneyfosho it's not my paper. It's a paper that i happen to agree with and which sums up the issue.
izakaminska	689940555195899904	2016-01-20T22:40:21	jtmoneyfosho I'm not biting. I've written plenty publicly on remittances. Good night
izakaminska	689940170334945280	2016-01-20T22:38:49	jtmoneyfosho look i really don't have time to hand hold you. If you disagree fine. What do i care.
izakaminska	689940045118214144	2016-01-20T22:38:19	jtmoneyfosho it was about saying this risk is the equivalent of this risk, i can hedge that. Oops, not equivalent at all. Oops basis risk.
izakaminska	689939854348677120	2016-01-20T22:37:34	jtmoneyfosho because the Whale was an internalisation story. It was JPM diversifying with itself. Not with others.
izakaminska	689939638044225537	2016-01-20T22:36:42	jtmoneyfosho look im busy, you're totally going off topic. Read the paper. Bureaucracies are our defences against fraud/predators.
izakaminska	689939477079461892	2016-01-20T22:36:04	jtmoneyfosho if you just kept the apple, it would rot.
izakaminska	689939403532300289	2016-01-20T22:35:46	jtmoneyfosho If you give someone an apple you don't want today, they owe you an equivalent apple when you need it. Life of apple extended
izakaminska	689939249244835842	2016-01-20T22:35:10	jtmoneyfosho yes they can. That's the WHOLE point of risk sharing.
izakaminska	689939154134777856	2016-01-20T22:34:47	jtmoneyfosho scaling should increase productivity.But there's no sign of productivity being improved at all.
izakaminska	689938786281771013	2016-01-20T22:33:19	jtmoneyfosho yes, good technology does. But Bitcoin unscales the system. And digital systems yet to be proven on scaling
izakaminska	689938572703571968	2016-01-20T22:32:28	jtmoneyfosho irrelevant to the conversation. Already explained the consensus problem.
izakaminska	689938053767544832	2016-01-20T22:30:25	jtmoneyfosho no. Whale is an entirely different story.
izakaminska	689937983529697281	2016-01-20T22:30:08	jtmoneyfosho Wealth perishes if it's not invested in something. Money is a claim on real goods and services which need maintaining
izakaminska	689937738984980480	2016-01-20T22:29:10	jtmoneyfosho because it has to invest in something if it's to protect wealth, and that investment is always gonna be a gamble
izakaminska	689937524442173441	2016-01-20T22:28:18	jtmoneyfosho seriously, it's carrot and stick stuff we teach children. You can't have stability without it.
izakaminska	689937438052081665	2016-01-20T22:27:58	jtmoneyfosho If you have no-one to protect your wealth you'll get robbed. Protection = fear of consequences
izakaminska	689937051538604033	2016-01-20T22:26:26	jtmoneyfosho wealth has to be constantly reinvested if it's to grow or stay constant. Otherwise it depreciates.
izakaminska	689936870390784000	2016-01-20T22:25:42	jtmoneyfosho it's the investing in the future part which creates economies of scale, which is the point of a financial system
izakaminska	689936659899613185	2016-01-20T22:24:52	jtmoneyfosho finance is simultaneously backward and forward looking. It's about taking existing wealth (backward) and investing in future
izakaminska	689936417565327360	2016-01-20T22:23:55	jtmoneyfosho absolutely not. The past is a sure thing. It's the future which we don't know about.
izakaminska	689936305451634688	2016-01-20T22:23:28	jtmoneyfosho it's the equivalent of forcing the bank to pledge a deposit before it can play at the casino, which it can lose if it's risky
izakaminska	689936150346207233	2016-01-20T22:22:51	jtmoneyfosho It doesn't, it provides a risk absorbing layer of capital which knows it  can be lost if bank misperforms
izakaminska	689935917293895686	2016-01-20T22:21:55	jtmoneyfosho if they are undeserving, they won't be able to raise capital will they?
izakaminska	689935675496488961	2016-01-20T22:20:58	jtmoneyfosho errr... forcing them to capitalise themselves means raising their own capital to back the system. Exact opposite.
izakaminska	689935341294370816	2016-01-20T22:19:38	jtmoneyfosho you end up with oligarchies either way. Just ones with really shoddy values. Read the paper.
izakaminska	689935244028465153	2016-01-20T22:19:15	jtmoneyfosho decentralisation and anarchy never create prosperity. They self organise to create order, whether fiefs, Lords or pirates.
izakaminska	689934985831280640	2016-01-20T22:18:13	jtmoneyfosho and i don't consider proof of work the same as skin in the game. It's backward looking not forward looking.
izakaminska	689934059565350912	2016-01-20T22:14:32	jtmoneyfosho if you know your bank is also invested in the same thing he's asking you to invest in, that controls risk
izakaminska	689933878451134464	2016-01-20T22:13:49	jtmoneyfosho (... take risk with other people's money more specifically). Hence why we are forcing banks to capitalise up.
izakaminska	689933745114234880	2016-01-20T22:13:17	jtmoneyfosho black swans etc. Skin in the game. If it doesn't cost you to play, you have nothing to lose, you take undue risk
izakaminska	689933349499080708	2016-01-20T22:11:43	jtmoneyfosho it's a zero sum game. You either distribute risk or you don't.
izakaminska	689933094493773825	2016-01-20T22:10:42	jtmoneyfosho sec stag simply makes it impossible to create rates of return. You end up in a steady maintenance focused state.
izakaminska	689932797612523521	2016-01-20T22:09:31	jtmoneyfosho growth is real and quantifiable. Sec stag has nothing to do with long cons.
izakaminska	689932606255828992	2016-01-20T22:08:46	jtmoneyfosho errr... no.
izakaminska	689932478669275136	2016-01-20T22:08:15	jtmoneyfosho you need a stable system without too much flux to create wealth.
izakaminska	689932404493000704	2016-01-20T22:07:58	jtmoneyfosho prosperity. For third time today, I refer to this  
izakaminska	689932254018191361	2016-01-20T22:07:22	jtmoneyfosho risk mgmt is like insurance, it only works if u all have different views. If you all bet on black, you all win or you all lose
izakaminska	689932105883783172	2016-01-20T22:06:47	jtmoneyfosho usually that's precisely what happens. Problem in 08 was network failure coz of group think about risk.
izakaminska	689931934114451457	2016-01-20T22:06:06	jtmoneyfosho survival of the fittest. poor service providers die. time always tells in the end if you protected par value or not.
izakaminska	689931560573911040	2016-01-20T22:04:37	jtmoneyfosho if anything centralises and standardises systems into a monoculture it's network protocols.
izakaminska	689931462389399552	2016-01-20T22:04:13	jtmoneyfosho the banking system is so decentralised each bank's process is different, hence why it takes ages to settle.
izakaminska	689931271976402944	2016-01-20T22:03:28	jtmoneyfosho the fact they self-insure the variance factor in the value for fungibility purposes is about risk-pooling
izakaminska	689931171027881985	2016-01-20T22:03:04	jtmoneyfosho and each bank issues its own digital currency. Or in banking terminology "liabilities"
izakaminska	689931010243432448	2016-01-20T22:02:25	jtmoneyfosho if the banking system was centralised we would have only one bank and one digital currency. We have 10000s of banks
izakaminska	689930823005532160	2016-01-20T22:01:41	jtmoneyfosho the banking system is not centralised. It's a decentralised system which squares off a master ledger. Total dif issue
izakaminska	689930263271477248	2016-01-20T21:59:27	jtmoneyfosho the problem isn't the banks. It's the growth model. The issue is secular stagnations and the limits 2 further scaling
izakaminska	689930026859532288	2016-01-20T21:58:31	jtmoneyfosho that is true. But controlled oligarchy is the one with the most tolerable flux. And one which can create prosperity.
izakaminska	689929751352442880	2016-01-20T21:57:25	jtmoneyfosho if you have a rep of stealing your customers' money you don't last long. See bitcoin businesses.
izakaminska	689929609698250752	2016-01-20T21:56:51	jtmoneyfosho once rep is gone, the game is roiled. But before that incentive is to defend reputation with upstanding behaviour.
izakaminska	689928246599815168	2016-01-20T21:51:26	jtmoneyfosho and there may be much bigger phenomena that led to group think in terms of risk. Like the onset of secular stagnation.

izakaminska	687558828003606529	2016-01-14T08:56:13	JoshCrumb cjenscook money has to be both about past value created and future value about to be created.
izakaminska	687558653189197824	2016-01-14T08:55:31	JoshCrumb cjenscook wealth depreciates unless it is constantly maintained/replenished. Past gold extraction is meaningless
izakaminska	687558383357014016	2016-01-14T08:54:27	JoshCrumb cjenscook what you gold ppl fail to understand is system depreciation. You cant just create wealth and sit on your butt forever

izakaminska	687032737287565317	2016-01-12T22:05:43	LonerganRoy that had absolutely nothing to do with the core point which is about replacement of private cars by fleet car rental

izakaminska	687032316036804609	2016-01-12T22:04:03	LonerganRoy will some portion of society benefit from better generic goods. Of course. But it won't stop ppl wanting better
izakaminska	687032129407074304	2016-01-12T22:03:18	LonerganRoy that's very different to absolutist statements that no one will own a car
izakaminska	687031917930246145	2016-01-12T22:02:28	LonerganRoy yes well as a physicist you should know a transporter would not be cost efficient for every day travel
izakaminska	687031602002673671	2016-01-12T22:01:13	LonerganRoy and that respects people's rights to own cars and homes exclusively if they want to.
izakaminska	687031490673262598	2016-01-12T22:00:46	LonerganRoy btw I am not anti Star Trek. My point is that diversity and balance make a prosperous society.
izakaminska	687031254269689856	2016-01-12T21:59:50	LonerganRoy or so we all wear Star Trek uniform in your communist utopia?
izakaminska	687031010861682689	2016-01-12T21:58:52	LonerganRoy Veblen goods are inherent to society. Are you going to ban fashion as well? That's a Veblen good you know
izakaminska	687030808150945792	2016-01-12T21:58:03	LonerganRoy omg. That wasn't my point! 
izakaminska	687030593406779396	2016-01-12T21:57:12	LonerganRoy it won't because full optionality is always going to be preferable to on-call use of a public car which might arrive gross
izakaminska	687030307082625025	2016-01-12T21:56:04	LonerganRoy tech utopia is never going 2 happen as long as we hv unequal wealth distribution &amp; obsession with undercutting life standards
izakaminska	687029962134650884	2016-01-12T21:54:42	LonerganRoy do see my beyond scarcity series from when I was in my tech utopian deluded phase
izakaminska	687029844065038336	2016-01-12T21:54:13	LonerganRoy yes well i was extremely 24th century until I actually sat down and thought about it.
izakaminska	687029696236752900	2016-01-12T21:53:38	LonerganRoy and btw car rental biz model highly unprofitable/volatile. It's only through insurance they really make their money.
izakaminska	687029495962927105	2016-01-12T21:52:50	LonerganRoy and I say they will never displace private car ownership desire
izakaminska	687029388798472193	2016-01-12T21:52:25	LonerganRoy I meant Veblen the writer about conspicuous consumption
izakaminska	687029216949481473	2016-01-12T21:51:44	LonerganRoy I used to advocate outright emoney, I don't anymore because surveillance society is not compatible with freedom
izakaminska	687028727704883201	2016-01-12T21:49:47	LonerganRoy you work in underwriting or sales?
izakaminska	687028538583695361	2016-01-12T21:49:02	LonerganRoy if everyone substitutes to common public cars you get the gross mean, and no adv of having a car structured to your needs
izakaminska	687028208693342209	2016-01-12T21:47:43	LonerganRoy cars are used on highly bespoke terms. Kid car seats, temp storage, dogs, messy, super clean, smokey...
izakaminska	687027951121072128	2016-01-12T21:46:42	LonerganRoy universal base goods are cheap because they require ppl to compromise on bespoke needs
izakaminska	687027767741935617	2016-01-12T21:45:58	LonerganRoy yes that's how the communists justified the one size fits all model too.
izakaminska	687027577677049856	2016-01-12T21:45:13	LonerganRoy the more bespoke and personalised something is the more expensive it usually is. Veblen
izakaminska	687027375863914496	2016-01-12T21:44:25	LonerganRoy markets orientate towards facilitating access to bespoke preferences at a premium.
izakaminska	687027110783901696	2016-01-12T21:43:22	LonerganRoy unsupervised sd car fleets will suffer a tragedy of the commons effect. Trash, misuse, wait times.
izakaminska	687026901337149440	2016-01-12T21:42:32	LonerganRoy there's no way you can have full optionality as a consumer which means exclusive ownership will remain desirable
izakaminska	687026716074741762	2016-01-12T21:41:48	LonerganRoy have you ever spent time operating a capital intensive business?
izakaminska	687026553302155264	2016-01-12T21:41:09	LonerganRoy full optionality is not available to customers via sd cars coz demand is variable
izakaminska	687026377573437440	2016-01-12T21:40:27	LonerganRoy but uber will never make the economics of SD cars work coz its model is based on suckers picking up capital/risk cost instead
izakaminska	687026087600218112	2016-01-12T21:39:18	LonerganRoy if they're about to get displaced by robot cars all the more reason they are getting screwed over
izakaminska	687025973863301120	2016-01-12T21:38:51	LonerganRoy who last I checked we're humans
izakaminska	687025936949211136	2016-01-12T21:38:42	LonerganRoy we entered into this conversation talking about the rights of uber drivers
izakaminska	687025871794892800	2016-01-12T21:38:26	LonerganRoy I've already had this discussion and written loads on this
izakaminska	687025726244130817	2016-01-12T21:37:52	LonerganRoy there isn't a successful car fleet company in the world that doesn't adjust fleet dynamically to avoid idle capacity costs
izakaminska	687025507909681152	2016-01-12T21:37:00	LonerganRoy b) I changed my mind because I realised all these initiatives overlook fleet mgmt costs and fact breakeven costs prevail
izakaminska	687025212647411712	2016-01-12T21:35:49	LonerganRoy a) I'm more than familiar with the argument coz I myself was arguing it 2 yrs ago
izakaminska	687024580238639104	2016-01-12T21:33:18	LonerganRoy yes the universal trabant was a great example of consumers choosing functionality over design diversity and quality
izakaminska	687024140390412289	2016-01-12T21:31:34	LonerganRoy the maintenance costs r reduced for everyone equally. The adv of owning one outright is cheaper too.
izakaminska	687023891022221312	2016-01-12T21:30:34	LonerganRoy even if production scales up -- dependent on battery availability -- u still have to compete w/ eqlbrm of everyone owning them
izakaminska	687023399353319424	2016-01-12T21:28:37	LonerganRoy electric cars still need maintenance. And electric cars r premium vehicles thus far
izakaminska	687007678443450370	2016-01-12T20:26:09	LonerganRoy not without compromising on car design and variety.
izakaminska	687007531357573121	2016-01-12T20:25:34	LonerganRoy and it's simply not true btw. Car service mechanics are not being disrupted any time soon 
izakaminska	687006844213149696	2016-01-12T20:22:50	LonerganRoy not at a standard that compensates for quality human touch care.
izakaminska	686995588865507328	2016-01-12T19:38:06	LonerganRoy but if they're sentient, they might very well rebel and become decepticons.
izakaminska	686995482401439744	2016-01-12T19:37:41	LonerganRoy unless the cars are self sentient and clean, fuel and manage themselves...
izakaminska	686995397831692288	2016-01-12T19:37:21	LonerganRoy i've written extensively about this, and i don't believe that's the case either. Capital costs don't go away.
izakaminska	686994058959581185	2016-01-12T19:32:02	LonerganRoy the technology does nothing to reduce the cost of supplying the market. S&amp;D is not matched.
izakaminska	686991328077606912	2016-01-12T19:21:10	LonerganRoy totally disagree. Long term prices will converge back to the equilibrium rate. If they become a monopoly, they become a cartel
izakaminska	686991146757812224	2016-01-12T19:20:27	stianwestlake changeist the descaling effects of airbnb don't. Ultimately it is a luxury vs the scaled up structure of the hotel network
izakaminska	686990998631780353	2016-01-12T19:19:52	stianwestlake changeist hotels have economies of scale and well negotiated replacement contracts that account for this
izakaminska	686990896320147457	2016-01-12T19:19:28	stianwestlake changeist but that cost of depreciation eats into the profitability of renting things in the first place.
izakaminska	686990761070583808	2016-01-12T19:18:55	stianwestlake changeist rental property depreciates more quickly than personal property.
izakaminska	686989223245787136	2016-01-12T19:12:49	changeist stianwestlake that's a non sequitur, unless you mean because of increased wear and tear?
izakaminska	686979891796000768	2016-01-12T18:35:44	stianwestlake i don't think it will yet be major factor. Who knows. Would have to chase the numbers.
izakaminska	686978283523682304	2016-01-12T18:29:20	stianwestlake  and don't forget toyota hybrids.
izakaminska	686978088396283904	2016-01-12T18:28:34	LonerganRoy  yes, that's right. But it's the consequences of all this on mkt prices that i'm interested in
izakaminska	686975276304183296	2016-01-12T18:17:23	LonerganRoy t0nyyates Gilesyb stianwestlake someone takes the loss. Whether it's the car company or the driver.
izakaminska	686973715125551104	2016-01-12T18:11:11	Gilesyb stianwestlake either way, you end up with drivers leaving the network. And when that happens prices go up.
izakaminska	686973574092075008	2016-01-12T18:10:38	Gilesyb stianwestlake errr... it certainly does. Labour self-regulates. Either via union, or via going bust.
izakaminska	686973405518782464	2016-01-12T18:09:57	Gilesyb stianwestlake as per my closing line. "if and when they unionise"  -- and indicators suggest they are.
izakaminska	686973220927488001	2016-01-12T18:09:13	Gilesyb stianwestlake and for as long as corps like Uber pretend this is viable alternative to a stable job.
izakaminska	686973119735660545	2016-01-12T18:08:49	Gilesyb stianwestlake who are investing in private businesses which will never break-even for as long as market supply is open-ended.
izakaminska	686973013061951488	2016-01-12T18:08:24	Gilesyb stianwestlake and my point is that the current price competitiveness of Uber is based on the blood sweat &amp; tears of its workers.
izakaminska	686972834564943872	2016-01-12T18:07:41	Gilesyb stianwestlake they keep going until they default.
izakaminska	686972635562012672	2016-01-12T18:06:54	Gilesyb stianwestlake the one in which the gig economy completely strips the labour economy off basic worker rights and standards.
izakaminska	686972426492735489	2016-01-12T18:06:04	Gilesyb stianwestlake uber drivers r often business amateurs who don't realise income is not continuous.
izakaminska	686972303775805440	2016-01-12T18:05:35	Gilesyb stianwestlake the difference here is that an employer accounts for staff cost and variable income flow when hiring.
izakaminska	686972211278684161	2016-01-12T18:05:13	Gilesyb stianwestlake also, lifestyles have to be rearranged. Stable curry careers have to be abandoned.
izakaminska	686972069192568832	2016-01-12T18:04:39	Gilesyb stianwestlake errr. there are sunk costs with uber. Someone has to take a loan for a car. Those cars hv to be produced
izakaminska	686971943459917824	2016-01-12T18:04:09	Gilesyb stianwestlake it's just like the gold rush.
izakaminska	686971812748607488	2016-01-12T18:03:38	Gilesyb stianwestlake then they are surprised about how little they are actually making.
izakaminska	686971754976247808	2016-01-12T18:03:24	Gilesyb stianwestlake yes, eventually, there will be a correction, but most drivers look at the gross revs, not net.
izakaminska	686971565074944001	2016-01-12T18:02:39	Gilesyb stianwestlake tell that to the leaseholders who are locked into 6/12 month lease deals or more!
izakaminska	686971381209235456	2016-01-12T18:01:55	Gilesyb stianwestlake i'm totally apolitical btw. I am looking at it extremely simplistically from a market supply/demand point of view.
izakaminska	686971208810782720	2016-01-12T18:01:14	Gilesyb stianwestlake just like shale producers don't operate below cost, neither can people. Especially within in a welfare state.
izakaminska	686971076950278145	2016-01-12T18:00:42	Gilesyb stianwestlake well, i see these happening now because break-even costs are a reality.
izakaminska	686970080652070913	2016-01-12T17:56:45	Gilesyb stianwestlake the return of the guild is coming. The only alternative is basic income.
izakaminska	686969657656475648	2016-01-12T17:55:04	stianwestlake Gilesyb GroomB MalcolmMoore but flexibility doesn't mean much if it turns into having to worker longer hours
izakaminska	686969561577566208	2016-01-12T17:54:41	stianwestlake Gilesyb GroomB MalcolmMoore there is obv substitution from one job vs the other. Uber life is flexible. That's attractive
izakaminska	686969336741892096	2016-01-12T17:53:47	Gilesyb stianwestlake it's entirely relevant! You can't subsidise a luxury vehicle if your wage can't afford it.
izakaminska	686969094982217728	2016-01-12T17:52:50	Gilesyb stianwestlake err.. disagree. Proves my point it's a cyclical phenomenon!
izakaminska	686968992699953152	2016-01-12T17:52:25	Gilesyb stianwestlake and i totally disagree. There r major diminishing returns in the long run either way.
izakaminska	686968745202454528	2016-01-12T17:51:26	Gilesyb stianwestlake they are hand to mouth. Pay for their insurance on a weekly basis.
izakaminska	686968684972212224	2016-01-12T17:51:12	Gilesyb stianwestlake how many minimum wage workers do you know who can drive a Mercedes E-class?!
izakaminska	686968608984006656	2016-01-12T17:50:54	Gilesyb stianwestlake uber drivers rent their cars for business purpose. Cars they could never afford personally.
izakaminska	686968407900733440	2016-01-12T17:50:06	Gilesyb stianwestlake i'm talking in the long term, absolutely. Hence Guilds. Hence Cartels. Hence unions. Hence dole.
izakaminska	686968215587688448	2016-01-12T17:49:20	Gilesyb stianwestlake if you r forgoing public transport for a taxi, well then it's clearly additional traffic.
izakaminska	686968106779062277	2016-01-12T17:48:54	Gilesyb stianwestlake if you start taking an Uber to work instead, that's an additional car in the public space which needs resting space
izakaminska	686967897974026240	2016-01-12T17:48:04	Gilesyb stianwestlake if you were driving habitually from A-B, you wd be doing so from private parking spot to private parking spot.
izakaminska	686967713906995200	2016-01-12T17:47:20	Gilesyb stianwestlake it doesn't because in total there are 20,000 additional cars on the road, either in parked spots or on the road.
izakaminska	686967344674041856	2016-01-12T17:45:52	Gilesyb stianwestlake that's besides the point. Making unions and worker collusion strikes illegal doesn't exactly help
izakaminska	686966898026778625	2016-01-12T17:44:06	Gilesyb stianwestlake a barrista union is gonna be extremely hard to organise. As is a cleaner union.
izakaminska	686966706611314690	2016-01-12T17:43:20	Gilesyb stianwestlake like i said, everything is relative. We have other social protections. And the key point is substitution.
izakaminska	686966253613891585	2016-01-12T17:41:32	Gilesyb stianwestlake and having 20,000 additional cars on the road adds traffic and/or parking somewhere in the capital.
izakaminska	686965901095251972	2016-01-12T17:40:08	Gilesyb stianwestlake it's not. That's the point. Because nothing beats public transport.
izakaminska	686965702566277122	2016-01-12T17:39:21	Gilesyb stianwestlake have no idea what you mean.
izakaminska	686965567287357441	2016-01-12T17:38:49	Gilesyb stianwestlake these things are a) entirely cyclical and b) tied to other national protections and fail safes.
izakaminska	686965232418295808	2016-01-12T17:37:29	Gilesyb stianwestlake and the point is?
izakaminska	686965146367995904	2016-01-12T17:37:08	Gilesyb stianwestlake for example 
izakaminska	686965114755481600	2016-01-12T17:37:01	Gilesyb stianwestlake and where do you think Uber drivers go when they are not in use? They have to park somewhere too.
izakaminska	686964872056279040	2016-01-12T17:36:03	Gilesyb stianwestlake I have no problem talking about cultural standards we take for granted in the west.
izakaminska	686964571513434112	2016-01-12T17:34:51	Gilesyb stianwestlake but so do cars which are supposed to be employed for earnings generation not personal use!
izakaminska	686964332228423680	2016-01-12T17:33:54	Gilesyb stianwestlake some industries are partial to cartelisation for a reason.
izakaminska	686964292684484608	2016-01-12T17:33:45	Gilesyb stianwestlake workers organise to protect their rights and their wages. It's called collective bargaining power or cartels.
izakaminska	686964084756099072	2016-01-12T17:32:55	Gilesyb stianwestlake ... it would be unaffordable.
izakaminska	686964052149563392	2016-01-12T17:32:47	Gilesyb stianwestlake for every person to have a taxi to meet potential peak demand, the system would have so much slack offpeak ...
izakaminska	686963779414945794	2016-01-12T17:31:42	Gilesyb stianwestlake really? I have full use of my car exclusively whenever i want. W/ taxis I am always subject to a run on capacity
izakaminska	686963608455122944	2016-01-12T17:31:02	Gilesyb stianwestlake taxis are and will remain a variable market, with major peak/offpeak swings. The more users, the bigger the swing
izakaminska	686963479115337728	2016-01-12T17:30:31	Gilesyb stianwestlake uber says they're still adding new users to justify the expanding network. But that's not really the point.
izakaminska	686963361347670016	2016-01-12T17:30:03	Gilesyb stianwestlake yes, and they'll be super depressed with their less than minimum wages because supply has to be managed.
izakaminska	686963048737824768	2016-01-12T17:28:48	Gilesyb stianwestlake "what market can bear" is tantamount to what sort of poverty we can tolerate in a civilised economy.
izakaminska	686962849558728704	2016-01-12T17:28:01	stianwestlake Gilesyb rental car companies downsize their fleets regularly and expand them on demand. No constant fleet size.
izakaminska	686962765823623168	2016-01-12T17:27:41	stianwestlake Gilesyb black cab drivers often share the same cab to maximise capital utilisation.
izakaminska	686962553524760577	2016-01-12T17:26:50	stianwestlake Gilesyb we know this because idle plants get mothballed and decommissioned.
izakaminska	686962467952586752	2016-01-12T17:26:30	stianwestlake Gilesyb you can't run a biz competitively based on supplying peak demand perfectly, whilst carrying idle capacity offpeak
izakaminska	686962267271872513	2016-01-12T17:25:42	stianwestlake Gilesyb we either have minimum wage standards based on quality of life or we dont
izakaminska	686962173541789697	2016-01-12T17:25:19	stianwestlake Gilesyb .. supply will withdraw and go work minimum wage/seek benefits.
izakaminska	686962094516875264	2016-01-12T17:25:01	stianwestlake Gilesyb unsurprisingly totally disagree. Service costs are a reality. Minimum wage is a reality. If costs r not covered..

izakaminska	685153036084342784	2016-01-07T17:36:27	m0veablebeast err no! Peak demand is never predictable. And dont fool yourself with business. rental peak demand is vacations. Incl Zipcar
izakaminska	685149899059523584	2016-01-07T17:24:00	m0veablebeast if you did cost average, you'd end up with a price that's similar or more expensive than standard taxi rate (human driven)
izakaminska	685149718859616257	2016-01-07T17:23:17	m0veablebeast you can't because peak demand is unpredictable. So unless you force people to preplan journeys you can't cost average
izakaminska	685149549103558656	2016-01-07T17:22:36	m0veablebeast missing the point. Uber "disrupted" market by bringing shed loads of additional supply, which won't breakeven.
izakaminska	685149408225312769	2016-01-07T17:22:03	m0veablebeast refineries/power plants only run when it's cost effective to run. And that's why SD cars won't be any cheaper.
izakaminska	685149269448343554	2016-01-07T17:21:29	m0veablebeast there are economics here which are ages old. They are the same as capacity that serves variable energy demand.
izakaminska	685149109251084288	2016-01-07T17:20:51	m0veablebeast but you can't just make offpeak supply vanish when it's not needed.
izakaminska	685149007702814720	2016-01-07T17:20:27	m0veablebeast car fleet companies manage this by disposing assets in offpeak periods. Taxi networks by controlling supply.
izakaminska	685148902400651265	2016-01-07T17:20:02	m0veablebeast if you had enough capacity to perfectly meet peak demand, you would have a surplus in offpeak times which has to be funded
izakaminska	685148743784624128	2016-01-07T17:19:24	m0veablebeast and that's because it's a peak/ offpeak business. The peak rate has to compensate for the offpeak non business.
izakaminska	685148612645367808	2016-01-07T17:18:53	m0veablebeast which is why nobody depends on NYC cabs. The only way this market works profitably is if it's purposely undersupplied!
izakaminska	685148438628007936	2016-01-07T17:18:11	m0veablebeast That's because they have a limited supply! Which is why you can never get one when you need one.
izakaminska	685147551289458689	2016-01-07T17:14:40	m0veablebeast taxi drivers also subsidise the capital cost cause they use their cars personally. That would be gone.
izakaminska	685147475934613505	2016-01-07T17:14:22	m0veablebeast taxi drivers are fleet managers at their own cost. You remove them you have to pay for the fleet management
izakaminska	685147156001460225	2016-01-07T17:13:06	m0veablebeast the price has to cover your break even cost. And your costs are  capital/energy to maintain the network
izakaminska	685147001160359936	2016-01-07T17:12:29	m0veablebeast but we've done that already. That system is called a bus network
izakaminska	685146942209454080	2016-01-07T17:12:15	m0veablebeast unless you make people take journeys only when you want them to, you can't improve on this
izakaminska	685146820650102785	2016-01-07T17:11:46	m0veablebeast fleet management and depreciation represents the single largest expense of most rental companies, incl zipcar
izakaminska	685146427031437316	2016-01-07T17:10:12	m0veablebeast there is such a thing as a break-even cost. You can't operate a business below cost without subsidisation from somewhere
izakaminska	685142270849511425	2016-01-07T16:53:41	m0veablebeast no, i'm saying SD car taxi fleets will be loss-making business unless they're subsidised by the state.
izakaminska	685141243425325056	2016-01-07T16:49:36	m0veablebeast driverless uber would never work because uber is only cheap cause of the driver contractor subsidy !!
izakaminska	685133611599851520	2016-01-07T16:19:16	m0veablebeast for many people that privacy factor justifies the capital cost of owning a car outright.
izakaminska	685133516531744772	2016-01-07T16:18:54	m0veablebeast but cars are also used in a personal capacity for storage, shopping, locking of personal items at location
izakaminska	685133322343809025	2016-01-07T16:18:07	m0veablebeast Taxis are the second most efficient way, but are always going to be more expensive than public transport
izakaminska	685133165757894659	2016-01-07T16:17:30	m0veablebeast public (buses, trains, planes) transport is the most cost efficient way to transit people.
izakaminska	685131668508831748	2016-01-07T16:11:33	m0veablebeast or in doubling up on total driven miles because of a lot more one-way tripping.
izakaminska	685131594521292801	2016-01-07T16:11:15	m0veablebeast SD cars cannot be provided on as need basis to people without someone funding that idle period when not in use
izakaminska	685131470009184256	2016-01-07T16:10:46	m0veablebeast if public transport was entirely reliable/as convenient noone would own cars.
izakaminska	685131330984738817	2016-01-07T16:10:13	m0veablebeast again, missing the point. Owning cars is about certainty of supply when u need it. U hv to fund that capital when idle
izakaminska	685130355813289984	2016-01-07T16:06:20	tomashirstecon alanbeattie exactly. Or if we all pay an SD tax.
izakaminska	685130247453470720	2016-01-07T16:05:54	alanbeattie because the resale is based on sale from corp to private individual. The whole point w/ SD is to disrupt individual ownership.
izakaminska	685125288255209472	2016-01-07T15:46:12	m0veablebeast and SD cars will only add to the problem not improve it.
izakaminska	685125216465465344	2016-01-07T15:45:55	m0veablebeast actually, i;m saying public transport is and always will be the most sustainable and cost efficient transport
izakaminska	685125054208851969	2016-01-07T15:45:16	alanbeattie the buyback discount is an effective depreciation hedge on the capital investment
izakaminska	685124916648259588	2016-01-07T15:44:43	alanbeattie it's all about keeping the depreciation rate predictable and constant. One reason cars depreciate is coz of these buybacks
izakaminska	685124801074212864	2016-01-07T15:44:16	alanbeattie in rental car world fleet adjusts seasonally through secondary market sell off of assets into well placed resale venues
izakaminska	685124656114839552	2016-01-07T15:43:41	alanbeattie the capital cost of the fleet is a ball and chain. It's more akin to refinery economics. u only enter mkt when price worth it
izakaminska	685124483003363328	2016-01-07T15:43:00	alanbeattie the bigger point is that car rental companies fluctuate the size of their fleets to respond to demand.
izakaminska	685124376287670272	2016-01-07T15:42:34	m0veablebeast it would be a hugely complex, non-consumer friendly business model.
izakaminska	685124316544036865	2016-01-07T15:42:20	m0veablebeast a SD fleet would be constant. It would have to manage the variable Supply/Demand shift via surcharging in peak time
izakaminska	685124200428892164	2016-01-07T15:41:53	m0veablebeast this is managed through car trading teams which dispose of non profitable assets in bulk or resale back to manufacturers
izakaminska	685124024800796672	2016-01-07T15:41:11	m0veablebeast In 2014 Avis's car rental fleet in jan was 433k vehicles, in summer it was 616k.
izakaminska	685123793635962880	2016-01-07T15:40:16	m0veablebeast car rental companies cover that cost via fluctuating the size of their fleet through lease ownership of assets.
izakaminska	685123658889707520	2016-01-07T15:39:43	m0veablebeast you miss the point. Someone has to fund the capital investment when it's not in use, and car use is variable. Hugely.
izakaminska	685120616232521728	2016-01-07T15:27:38	m0veablebeast we could have a citizen tax for a government managed fleet, but ppl don;t tend to like taxes
izakaminska	685120302762819585	2016-01-07T15:26:23	m0veablebeast also a SD car has to make some portion of a double journey, so increases traffic.
izakaminska	685120105957687296	2016-01-07T15:25:36	m0veablebeast and thats cause car rental is barely profitable as it is, and relies on all sorts of cross-subsidisations
izakaminska	685119943571050497	2016-01-07T15:24:58	m0veablebeast my point, if you actually followed, is that SD cars will not be competitive w/ ones humans drive themselves on a fleet basis
izakaminska	685117769784909824	2016-01-07T15:16:19	m0veablebeast alanbeattie FYI When Avis bought Zipcar it was not profitable.
izakaminska	685117422173589504	2016-01-07T15:14:56	m0veablebeast utilisation = more mileage, which equals more service cost. There's no free lunch here.
izakaminska	685117273321902080	2016-01-07T15:14:21	m0veablebeast alanbeattie Exactly! That's coming at someone's burden. A hidden subsidy which won't be around w/ SD cars
izakaminska	685116954588385280	2016-01-07T15:13:05	m0veablebeast alanbeattie also a personal car is always treated more respectfully than a shared car. Wear &amp; tear is more extreme
izakaminska	685116791023087616	2016-01-07T15:12:26	m0veablebeast alanbeattie yes, but it's not cheap 2 own a rental fleet either. Cost doesn't disappear. It's how you distribute it
izakaminska	685116511955062784	2016-01-07T15:11:19	m0veablebeast alanbeattie those cars still have to be serviced and repositioned in hubs. See boris bikes operating costs
izakaminska	685116404572532736	2016-01-07T15:10:54	m0veablebeast alanbeattie Zipcar works cause members take personal responsibility and pay a monthly rate.
izakaminska	685116211521273857	2016-01-07T15:10:08	m0veablebeast alanbeattie so the coders managing the networks will all work from home I presume?
izakaminska	685116016351932417	2016-01-07T15:09:21	alanbeattie m0veablebeast My other hunch: IT personnel not that cheap, and liability from potential hacking of an SD car huge.
izakaminska	685115760428072960	2016-01-07T15:08:20	alanbeattie m0veablebeast yes indeed. And my hunch is that the costs at the end of the day won't make SD cars that compelling.
izakaminska	685115528634064896	2016-01-07T15:07:25	m0veablebeast alanbeattie so basically you're proposing that rather than pay as i go, we all subscribe to a SD monthly taxi tax?
izakaminska	685114767950872577	2016-01-07T15:04:24	m0veablebeast alanbeattie zipcar doesn't have maintenance costs? Hmmm....

izakaminska	685107949161820160	2016-01-07T14:37:18	Sapere_vivere not sure that changes the point.
izakaminska	685107547041361920	2016-01-07T14:35:42	MayfairCynic then there are weather related maintenance factors. Defreezing the sensors. Winter tyres, snow undigging.
izakaminska	685107222553165824	2016-01-07T14:34:25	MayfairCynic not just that. Public cars on the road way more than normal cars. Mileage. There's also tyre wear &amp; tear (tyres not cheap)
izakaminska	685107003803451392	2016-01-07T14:33:33	Sapere_vivere to a degree yes. But it was generally very insightful.
izakaminska	685106927668432897	2016-01-07T14:33:14	jonathanglick yes, but i doubt very much it will be cheaper than a business operated by human drivers.
izakaminska	685102614707630081	2016-01-07T14:16:06	makhno4ever all the more reason why imho the costs won't work. Non SD journeys will be cheaper.
izakaminska	685101694502440960	2016-01-07T14:12:27	jonathanglick you miss the point. The subsidy is removed if you have to hire a professional maintenance team.
izakaminska	685101374615453697	2016-01-07T14:11:10	Macr0man well exactly.
izakaminska	685101207262769152	2016-01-07T14:10:31	MayfairCynic t0nyyates just because a car can drive itself doesn't mean it can maintain itself.
izakaminska	685101044754427904	2016-01-07T14:09:52	MayfairCynic t0nyyates I am talking about rental cars. They're public. And the core cost is turnaround maintenance, cleaning, servicing
izakaminska	685100685902385152	2016-01-07T14:08:26	MayfairCynic t0nyyates human driven taxis can get additional rev from advertising too. Not a unique auxiliary.
izakaminska	685100453562982400	2016-01-07T14:07:31	MayfairCynic t0nyyates they are not tiny. You're deluded if you think maintenance costs of public vehicles r tiny.
izakaminska	685100302085652480	2016-01-07T14:06:55	Macr0man but then i'd rather take taxis where i don't have to have a deposit sliced off my card every time i use them.
izakaminska	685100159894712320	2016-01-07T14:06:21	Macr0man I agree. But I was preempting the SD defence being they won't need insurance
izakaminska	685100004558540800	2016-01-07T14:05:44	t0nyyates I'd rather take the human driven taxi that doesn't charge me an insurance excess because cost bundled in to service
izakaminska	685099783573401600	2016-01-07T14:04:51	jonathanglick i'm sure we've had this discussion before. I'm saying Uber/Lyft isn't profitable if it has to own and maintain own fleet
izakaminska	685099579709198336	2016-01-07T14:04:02	t0nyyates will self-driving cars not need summer/winter tyres changed? They will. Someone has to pay for that.
izakaminska	685099402529214464	2016-01-07T14:03:20	t0nyyates that doesn't improve the profitability. The wear and tear and maintenance costs are the issue.
izakaminska	685099184173793281	2016-01-07T14:02:28	jonathanglick rental companies make it work via auxiliaries, like fuel surcharge and insurance
izakaminska	685099119686348800	2016-01-07T14:02:13	jonathanglick it's the same point as before. Owning capital intensive fleets in a variable market is not profitable on car scale
izakaminska	685098598749581312	2016-01-07T14:00:09	izakaminska to wit, if self-driving cars are so safe they don't need to sell insurance, methinks there's a profitability prob

izakaminska	684632329541828608	2016-01-06T07:07:21	TamasBlummer somebody else has to fund your eccentricities. If your system was valuable it would be able to fund itself w/out dilution

izakaminska	684164582592626689	2016-01-05T00:08:42	pkedrosky professional retailers provide an expert curation/selection service which is also under appreciated.
izakaminska	684164440066002944	2016-01-05T00:08:08	pkedrosky you increasingly have to be in a professional niche to make it worth your time trawling the 1000s of options
izakaminska	684164173882851330	2016-01-05T00:07:04	pkedrosky I do say the same. The reach has been compromised by the filtering power of the search engines

izakaminska	684162429740290048	2016-01-05T00:00:09	pkedrosky it's extremely debatable whether Airbnb is actually any cheaper vs professionally run capacity as well.
izakaminska	684162019034021888	2016-01-04T23:58:31	pkedrosky and in particular general risk, maintenance, health, safety, cleaning &amp; turnaround costs.

izakaminska	684074921358684160	2016-01-04T18:12:25	tyillc oditorium indeed. That's the point of division of labour, no? :)
izakaminska	684074377265152000	2016-01-04T18:10:15	tyillc oditorium you can take the horse to water, but you can't make it drink.
izakaminska	684074334692978688	2016-01-04T18:10:05	tyillc oditorium yes of course. But it's wrong to mistake universal access to info as a "problem solved" scenario for society
izakaminska	684073642234392576	2016-01-04T18:07:20	tyillc oditorium you need to be a buyer or prospective buyer to get the info, which creates evaluation bias
izakaminska	684073526496747520	2016-01-04T18:06:52	tyillc oditorium I think this is a big problem with current demise of public markets in silicon valley land 
izakaminska	684073255297224704	2016-01-04T18:05:48	tyillc oditorium this is exactly the same problem we're going to have with rise of liquid "private security markets"
izakaminska	684073136917233664	2016-01-04T18:05:19	tyillc oditorium tell me about it. I remember the days. :-(
izakaminska	684073031908651011	2016-01-04T18:04:54	tyillc oditorium access to information is no substitute for knowledge (which is processed information for informing purposes)
izakaminska	684072881463103488	2016-01-04T18:04:19	tyillc oditorium that's the basis of this post btw: 
izakaminska	684072744548478977	2016-01-04T18:03:46	tyillc oditorium he doesn't. He's feeling in the dark. Or has to conduct his own market research, which is expensive
izakaminska	684072546703118338	2016-01-04T18:02:59	tyillc oditorium nor did it help that everything was parked in off B/S structures with prospectuses impossible to get hold of by press.
izakaminska	684072236236537856	2016-01-04T18:01:45	oditorium ... and same applies to shoddy de-risking processes that haven't yet proven their worth in performance terms.
izakaminska	684072061640245248	2016-01-04T18:01:03	oditorium .. that get everyone to agree something has value, whether it does or not.
izakaminska	684071996242694145	2016-01-04T18:00:48	oditorium  the point is emperor's clothes. Counterfeiting is about creating illusion of value by mimicking known processes ..
izakaminska	684071517936840705	2016-01-04T17:58:53	oditorium and a counterfeit is cheap for a reason, just like a missold security is.
izakaminska	684071391625392129	2016-01-04T17:58:23	oditorium no, the point is caveat emptor applies in all cases. If it looks too good to be true it probably is.
izakaminska	684071227242233856	2016-01-04T17:57:44	oditorium that's totally not a defence!  There are limits to caveat emptor!! Otherwise i'd spend 180 hours a week reading T&amp;Cs
izakaminska	684070973432328196	2016-01-04T17:56:44	oditorium and the cosy terms between ratings agencies and originators had a lot to do with the probs. Much like cryptocurrency madness
izakaminska	684070792972361729	2016-01-04T17:56:01	oditorium that the ratings agencies were stupid is another matter entirely.
izakaminska	684070401492840449	2016-01-04T17:54:27	oditorium It was the accountability/reputation trail meanwhile which forced banks to recognise and back these failing assets unexpectedly
izakaminska	684069932854808576	2016-01-04T17:52:36	oditorium whether they were stupid is another matter entirely. But accepting counterfeit goods is equally stupid.
izakaminska	684069855872561152	2016-01-04T17:52:17	oditorium which there was plenty of because asset managers had no idea what they were buying and trusted the sales teams of the originators
izakaminska	684069707868192775	2016-01-04T17:51:42	oditorium  That the crap tranche acted as expected is not the point
izakaminska	684069548396535808	2016-01-04T17:51:04	oditorium that is totally not true. The AAA tranches were completely missold as being near risk-free.
izakaminska	684069318791921665	2016-01-04T17:50:09	oditorium caveat emptor applies both to acceptance of counterfeits and shoddy goods misrepresented as good ones.
izakaminska	684069194296651776	2016-01-04T17:49:39	oditorium you are performing the same trick to some degree.
izakaminska	684069103519281153	2016-01-04T17:49:18	oditorium if you are creating an asset and guaranteeing it will protect par value (monolines, complex structures etc which magic risk away)
izakaminska	684068958085976064	2016-01-04T17:48:43	oditorium the good he sells has no further resale or utility value, even tho it may have been sold on premise it does. (Ponzis etc)
izakaminska	684068818197590016	2016-01-04T17:48:10	oditorium a snake oil salesmen knows he is selling crap value, but runs off before he can be caught.
izakaminska	684068718519959553	2016-01-04T17:47:46	oditorium IMO if the asset has been miss-sold in terms of risk it is as good as a counterfeit asset. The only dif is accountability
izakaminska	684068012798930944	2016-01-04T17:44:58	oditorium this is a debate about the underpinnings of the subprime crisis and misselling of such securities. Not having that today.
izakaminska	684060468873400320	2016-01-04T17:14:59	oditorium i'm actually mostly interested in how financial hackers manufacture fake assets to create false deposits w/ purchasing power
izakaminska	684060191143374853	2016-01-04T17:13:53	oditorium unless (of course) the low quality is perfectly priced in, and it's transparent that it's low quality.
izakaminska	684060021089517569	2016-01-04T17:13:12	oditorium and specifically connection between asset quality and justifiable "money". The lower the quality, the more counterfeit-like
izakaminska	684059780768493570	2016-01-04T17:12:15	oditorium like i said, I'm interested only in the fact people r making connection between asset origination and money supply...
izakaminska	684059481270030336	2016-01-04T17:11:04	oditorium if you have crappy standards but pretend like you don't (subprime), you're creating unsupportable liabilities into the system
izakaminska	684059235349573632	2016-01-04T17:10:05	oditorium i think you're taking this too literally. For me, this is about quality control.
izakaminska	684058839143047168	2016-01-04T17:08:31	oditorium the real difference is that the originators are known, so can theoretically be accountable.
izakaminska	684058665779871744	2016-01-04T17:07:49	oditorium manufacturing assets that are perceived less risky than they really are, adds unsupported liabilities into the system.
izakaminska	684058273004294144	2016-01-04T17:06:16	oditorium if the system can handle that liability (i.e. there is no inflation) it's wealth distributing dilution (albeit to counterfeiters)
izakaminska	684057918891814914	2016-01-04T17:04:51	oditorium regular counterfeiters add notes into circulation which are nobody's direct liability.
izakaminska	684057783927439362	2016-01-04T17:04:19	oditorium the point I'm interested in is how counterfeiting relates to quality of assets created.
izakaminska	684057475188953088	2016-01-04T17:03:05	oditorium well the bonds weren't entirely valueless, just not as valuable as expected.
izakaminska	684056470011428864	2016-01-04T16:59:06	oditorium i can't vouch for quality of source, but the counterfeiting/origination logic is sound.
izakaminska	684051616832589824	2016-01-04T16:39:49	izakaminska cyber fraudsters understand this.
izakaminska	684051319838130179	2016-01-04T16:38:38	Counterfeiting digital cash is all about the origination procedure (ppl starting 2 get it) 
izakaminska	684001051394084864	2016-01-04T13:18:53	prestonjbyrne that was indeed my impression.
izakaminska	683987912367673345	2016-01-04T12:26:40	HemmensBen so it's not the evidence that's important outright, but the interpretation of evidence? Do you have a link to popper citation?
izakaminska	683987126065717248	2016-01-04T12:23:33	HemmensBen also what's considered right/wrong changes all the time, as standards of society change.
izakaminska	683986823203450880	2016-01-04T12:22:21	HemmensBen it posits this is different to science, which is about discovering evidence-based absolutes on preponderance of evidence basis
izakaminska	683986618190004224	2016-01-04T12:21:32	HemmensBen yup. The piece reflects on how subjectivity is at the heart of the legal system, coz right/wrong is itself subjective
izakaminska	683982757270261762	2016-01-04T12:06:11	delmoi HemmensBen google suggests otherwise. Direct me to peer reviewed work that says subjectivity not a debate topic or stop bugging me
izakaminska	683965912840552448	2016-01-04T10:59:15	delmoi HemmensBen I may not be a scientist but I'm fairly confident there's a hell of a lot of scientific debate about subjective reality
izakaminska	683965422417383424	2016-01-04T10:57:18	delmoi HemmensBen or reveal your own credentials which allow you to state as much and have a lay person like me trust you on it
