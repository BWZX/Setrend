Fritz_100	717954528042045440	2016-04-07T05:57:53	@terrytrading I have a theory... or perhaps biased observation... that many very smart people eat light but may have a certain drug habit
Fritz_100	717954078723088385	2016-04-07T05:56:05	@terrytrading If you look at people who lived longest, many drank a lot, smoked a lot.... Smart people: Jim Simons, Ingvar Kamprad
Fritz_100	717945962195394560	2016-04-07T05:23:50	@terrytrading There's so much we don't know. Perhaps drugs help us reduce reliance on even more harmful food? Best is to rely on base rates
Fritz_100	717945755651039232	2016-04-07T05:23:01	@terrytrading With food, drugs I think it's best to play safe... look at random sample of x people. Who's leading healthy, good lives. Copy
Fritz_100	717945514847653889	2016-04-07T05:22:04	@terrytrading I think that's true, but there is also no proof that it *doesn't do* any harm long-term

Fritz_100	717938697891479553	2016-04-07T04:54:58	@terrytrading I'm too rational to accept religion, but ppl seem to feel comfortable "knowing" there's someone watching over you
Fritz_100	717937302303940608	2016-04-07T04:49:26	@terrytrading That is to say, make sure you push yourself to get rewards that are long-term beneficial or you. Eg avoid drugs, cynicism

Fritz_100	713277009850314752	2016-03-25T08:11:05	Asset purchases by central banks (including EM). Would love to see an updated chart 
Fritz_100	713255459466022912	2016-03-25T06:45:27	eboroian The bulls argue they can close the capital account entirely. I'm skeptical tho don't really know. Didn't work in Thailand 1997
Fritz_100	713255115986063360	2016-03-25T06:44:05	eboroian The only issue with solving debt problem with more debt is 1) delay the problem 2) M2/FX reserve ratio worse so capital outflows
Fritz_100	713254966362710016	2016-03-25T06:43:30	eboroian Perhaps it will be a few years delayed. Lower rates to zero can perhaps boost consumer borrowing further. Fiscal stimulus too
Fritz_100	713254589059829761	2016-03-25T06:42:00	eboroian I lived in China for many years so perhaps a bit biased. Base rates imply high probability of trouble after such a credit boom
Fritz_100	713254155586940928	2016-03-25T06:40:16	eboroian So whoever borrowed in USD ($5 trill in corp debt?) must be bullish EM/commo/bearish USD. That's a big force (tho not only one)
Fritz_100	713253839005069312	2016-03-25T06:39:01	eboroian I don't care too much about sentiment but rather positioning. Only natural that USD/EUR/JPY appreciate after years of massive QE

Fritz_100	713036268532142080	2016-03-24T16:14:28	eboroian Re EM in general, commodity prices unlikely to reverse, esp not when Chinese demand drops off. Liquidity is tight QE little effect
Fritz_100	713035536672235521	2016-03-24T16:11:34	eboroian I'm guessing other factors may overshadow the rate differential effect. As you say, eventually we get a risk off climate
Fritz_100	713035007166550016	2016-03-24T16:09:27	eboroian Eventually Fed will lower rates, lowering yield differential between US and other funding currencies. But ST inflation up probably
Fritz_100	713034565627957248	2016-03-24T16:07:42	eboroian  2. Nominal yields in US vs Europe vs Japan 3. Quantitative easing now having stopped 4. Reversing QE flows as corp debt repaid
Fritz_100	713034468353683457	2016-03-24T16:07:19	eboroian I think there 4 factors at play: 1. Current account deficit changing due to less net energy exports. USD is an inverse of oil px
Fritz_100	712984524309684224	2016-03-24T12:48:51	eboroian For USD to weaken substantially, need much higher US energy imports (unlikely). Then 5trillion of USD corp debt maturing (2018-19)
Fritz_100	712983745482006528	2016-03-24T12:45:46	eboroian Could be a short-term respite due to higher oil. But just like natgas since 08, I'd guess oil price will stay low longer-term
Fritz_100	712983203133267968	2016-03-24T12:43:36	eboroian How do you know Fed will be more hawkish than the market expects? Perhaps a higher oil price will give rise to inflation pressure?

Fritz_100	704555221800751106	2016-03-01T06:33:49	bauhiniacapital All valid points...
Fritz_100	704554210323369986	2016-03-01T06:29:48	bauhiniacapital So perhaps his point was that GDP growth in the US is worth a lot more than in eg China. Again, speaks for elevated ratio
Fritz_100	704553931452461057	2016-03-01T06:28:41	bauhiniacapital Actually, he explained the statement by saying that if China builds a useless bridge it adds to GDP but no value
Fritz_100	704553661515476993	2016-03-01T06:27:37	bauhiniacapital Possibly, I have no idea. I assume he was comparing mkt cap/GDP ratios with those of other countries (eg China, Japan, etc)
Fritz_100	704542142853566464	2016-03-01T05:41:51	bauhiniacapital Not exactly sure either what he meant (Mark Hart). But clearly mkt cap/GDP should be higher if margins are higher cet par

Fritz_100	701662876415602688	2016-02-22T07:00:40	Sparticuszorro Which causes the buying to become exponential. And LTVs improving, paving way for further credit growth. Bubble dynamics
Fritz_100	701662704931504128	2016-02-22T06:59:59	Sparticuszorro I think so. Property the asset class most exposed to speculative epidemics... trigger to buy usually comes via word-of-mouth

Fritz_100	699431270493736960	2016-02-16T03:13:04	anatocismos Yes. Probably half-way through the correction. My bet would be that hot money flows to the sector reverse to starting point
