sahilkapur	715037499744239617	2016-03-30T04:46:39	EricaGrieder I appreciate that, but your expertise on Texas far outstrips mine on any particular topic!

sahilkapur	715035674001465348	2016-03-30T04:39:24	EricaGrieder DougHeye I think the lesson is we can’t take our cues from a narrow set of people, especially if they’re out of sync w/base.
sahilkapur	715035482703405056	2016-03-30T04:38:38	EricaGrieder DougHeye that’s part of my point—Obama was well-liked by Dem elites. Unlike Cruz he had endorsements. Opposition was weaker.
sahilkapur	715034769935958016	2016-03-30T04:35:48	reidepstein DougHeye SteveKornacki usually sunlight = best disinfectant. Coverage of Trump prompted a very diff reaction w/ GOP voters.
sahilkapur	715033686203371526	2016-03-30T04:31:30	DougHeye SteveKornacki attracting *attention* is one thing; media contributed. Attracting *support* is another; that’s about the party.
sahilkapur	715032664080793606	2016-03-30T04:27:26	EricaGrieder DougHeye who, Cruz? I don’t think that’s the issue. Disconnect is many take cues from party elites, who insisted he was DOA.
sahilkapur	715031237354766338	2016-03-30T04:21:46	EricaGrieder DougHeye true - if anything most reporters underestimated Cruz (and overestimated, say, Rubio) every step of the way.
sahilkapur	715030961113665537	2016-03-30T04:20:40	.DougHeye He got vast amounts of of critical coverage that would’ve sunk any other modern candidate. Examples: 
sahilkapur	715030024177459209	2016-03-30T04:16:57	For an exact quote, here's how Trump set up his escape hatch from the "pledge" back in September. 
sahilkapur	715028834173730816	2016-03-30T04:12:13	Question for the “media is to blame for Trump” crowd—only viable alternative is about as detested by GOP elites. Did media create him too?
sahilkapur	715025987839344640	2016-03-30T04:00:54	Remember how Trump’s gigantic caveat to the loyalty pledge was that he must be treated “fairly”? He just cited that to break the pledge.
sahilkapur	715007145205493760	2016-03-30T02:46:02	“I don’t want to get into how courageous I am.” —JohnKasich
sahilkapur	715007006000750592	2016-03-30T02:45:29	Kasich was just asked to support personhood rights for the unborn. He didn’t bit, maintained exceptions for rape, incest, mother’s life.
sahilkapur	715005871261093892	2016-03-30T02:40:58	So, Trump and Kasich basically just lit the RNC nominee pledge on fire, while Cruz kinda tiptoed away from it.
sahilkapur	715005514153742341	2016-03-30T02:39:33	KASICH also backs off RNC pledge: “I gotta see what happens. If the nominee’s somebody who’s…hurting the country I can't stand behind them.”
sahilkapur	715003337486286849	2016-03-30T02:30:54	John Kasich would like you to know that he’s a leader.
sahilkapur	715001364271775744	2016-03-30T02:23:03	Kasich gets a good question: is a European-style anti-immigration movement materializing in the US? (Spoiler: yes.) 
sahilkapur	715000936654090240	2016-03-30T02:21:22	Kasich gets seriously annoyed when a questioner reduces his Medicaid expansion decision to a surrender to Obamacare.
sahilkapur	714999964506714117	2016-03-30T02:17:30	(Apologies, I’m told the “tweet-happy” quote was about Kasich’s aide, not Trump. I deleted to avoid confusion.)
sahilkapur	714993665073090560	2016-03-30T01:52:28	QUESTION: When was the last time you actually apologized for something?  TRUMP: Oh. Uh…  Then says he’s apologized to his mother and wife.
sahilkapur	714993204957937664	2016-03-30T01:50:38	“I’ve changed course on many, many things,” Trump correctly admits, referencing his shift on abortion.
sahilkapur	714992417779228672	2016-03-30T01:47:30	That sound you just heard is Reince having a heart attack.  If Trump turns on the GOP, the GOP is dead. 
sahilkapur	714992171406004225	2016-03-30T01:46:32	Trump (accurately!) says Cruz seemed "tormented" on the nominee pledge: "I don't want his support," Trump says. "I don't need his support."
sahilkapur	714991678491398145	2016-03-30T01:44:34	"I have been treated very unfairly," Trump says of breaking his pledge, "by basically the RNC, the Republican Party, the establishment."
sahilkapur	714991280275779584	2016-03-30T01:42:59	Huh, Trump just said he won’t promise to support the nominee if it’s Cruz (he signed a pledge saying he’d back the nominee.)
sahilkapur	714989924924198913	2016-03-30T01:37:36	"The United States cannot afford to be the policeman of the world anymore folks. We have to rebuild our own country,” says realDonaldTrump.

sahilkapur	714978346338226177	2016-03-30T00:51:36	Over the campaign Cruz has gotten better at expressing empathy for questioners who reveal their suffering. Rubio mastered this craft early.
sahilkapur	714977673030856706	2016-03-30T00:48:55	teddyschleifer yeah
sahilkapur	714977598330290176	2016-03-30T00:48:37	In other words, Cruz hasn't disavowed his pledge to support the nominee if it's Trump. He just doesn't want to reiterate or discuss it.
sahilkapur	714977329328611329	2016-03-30T00:47:33	Cruz has gone from saying plainly he'd support the nominee even if it's Trump to dodging the question and saying he'll defeat him.
