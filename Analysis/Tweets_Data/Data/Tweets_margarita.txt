margarita	725146139679461377	2016-04-27T02:14:46	bookoisseur BrettRedacted raju all journalists should get paid training for multimedia production, to avoid print versus video cuts
margarita	725144892155023361	2016-04-27T02:09:49	BrettRedacted bookoisseur raju don't think any person in a bustling newsroom today would say there's one holy grail medium. Just false
margarita	725143598623240192	2016-04-27T02:04:41	tcarmody raju i think this may happen, obviously, leading to job losses like it did with YouTube
margarita	725143290748764160	2016-04-27T02:03:27	Anyway, consider me very pro social networks paying for ad-free video production with no editorial side strings!
margarita	725143065397202946	2016-04-27T02:02:33	tcarmody raju yeah I hope people remember what happened next
margarita	725142860803235842	2016-04-27T02:01:45	bookoisseur raju one could argue Facebook paying for ad free video is the ideal ugh ugh
margarita	725141974827827200	2016-04-27T01:58:13	margarita not new per se. Google gave tens of millions for news cos to create youtube channels/unique content about 5 years ago. Seductive
margarita	725142087608442885	2016-04-27T01:58:40	raju yes, I remember what happened, too.
margarita	725142002413768704	2016-04-27T01:58:20	The only question I have is, does a publicly traded company need to disclose when it pays third parties to use or test products? No, right?
margarita	725141471448469504	2016-04-27T01:56:13	Sometimes if you want buy in, you have to buy people in. That's common in other industries.

margarita	725140396532191232	2016-04-27T01:51:57	jledbetter no I didn't!
margarita	725139840044568581	2016-04-27T01:49:44	Until it can offer video ads, it looks like Facebook is paying media companies tens of thousands of dollars to use Facebook Live.
