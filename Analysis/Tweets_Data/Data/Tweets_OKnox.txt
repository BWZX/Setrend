OKnox	725662482145095680	2016-04-28T12:26:32	jdirish5oh I don't think that's correct. As for feelings, in your own words: 
OKnox	725662079273816065	2016-04-28T12:24:56	19Pam56 Oh, I meant the 28 pages.
OKnox	725658506666348544	2016-04-28T12:10:44	[somewhere, a US senator who fakes phone calls to escape reporters is taking note of whether this works]

OKnox	725656434743103489	2016-04-28T12:02:30	19Pam56 I dunno, Pam. "Raw" files are basically every allegation, untested. Not great information value until processed.
OKnox	725656060757991424	2016-04-28T12:01:01	jdirish5oh You're simultaneously misremembering 2008 (Rev Wright, anyone?) &amp; misunderstanding 2016. While fantasizing about my "feelings."
OKnox	725655092779687936	2016-04-28T11:57:10	Interesting read from RichardGrenell on Trump foreign policy. (But why the teleprompter mention?) 
OKnox	725643149515825160	2016-04-28T11:09:43	jdirish5oh nah, I'm just too old to go for "OMG talk about this other thing" misdirection plays.
OKnox	725526303005413376	2016-04-28T03:25:24	jdirish5oh so you *do* think the Moon landing was faked. Can't say I'm surprised.
OKnox	725513683250610176	2016-04-28T02:35:16	I see that the feeling is rather widespread  
OKnox	725512100156694528	2016-04-28T02:28:58	jdirish5oh campbell_brown politico yes! Very much! I'm almost as heartbroken as when that other reader said the Moon landing was fake!

OKnox	725507959598551040	2016-04-28T02:12:31	...ONLY disclosing them (without also disclosing results of US efforts to corroborate unverified "raw" info) would be bad

OKnox	725506307147616256	2016-04-28T02:05:57	jdirish5oh campbell_brown politico thanks for the garbage take.
OKnox	725502010544545792	2016-04-28T01:48:53	realchriswilson right, if the amount of coverage after his announcement was all "he says Mexicans are rapists" but his popularity rose...
