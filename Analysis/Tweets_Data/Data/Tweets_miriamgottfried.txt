miriamgottfried	709757132208521216	2016-03-15T15:04:21	Another side effect of original content growing at 5x the rate of TV watching may also be a much lower ROI on original content.
miriamgottfried	709752657313927169	2016-03-15T14:46:34	max02050 What do you think of DTV's TV everywhere and its plans for various OTT bundles?
miriamgottfried	709750539588866049	2016-03-15T14:38:09	max02050 Yes, fragmentation is bad for the value of TV/video inventory.
miriamgottfried	709749725906509824	2016-03-15T14:34:55	eriks Yes. But some of the original content being watched outside of traditional TV is also owned by the major media cos.
miriamgottfried	709749561770827776	2016-03-15T14:34:16	That would be traditional TV, of course. Not sure if that number includes time spent on apps owned by major media cos.

miriamgottfried	709480447173120001	2016-03-14T20:44:54	jason_kint WSJ Google not bound by Cable Act is my understanding. But even if Fiber is, set-top box collection probably wouldn't be.
miriamgottfried	709477697018327040	2016-03-14T20:33:59	jason_kint WSJ As I understand, there is no distinction. Same privacy policy applies 
miriamgottfried	709476747092353024	2016-03-14T20:30:12	jason_kint WSJ Many say FCC can't enforce this bc Google isn't in law. FCC is asking MVPDs to verify that Google and others are following.
miriamgottfried	709472987381157890	2016-03-14T20:15:16	Bmuni83Weiss That's because of a deal that was struck in 2012. Not clear that Disney would do that deal today.

miriamgottfried	709468549841031168	2016-03-14T19:57:38	jason_kint WSJ The FCC rule wouldn't necessarily benefit digital programmers, though. It would more clearly benefit big tech.
miriamgottfried	709468277039300609	2016-03-14T19:56:33	jason_kint WSJ Yes. Cable cos are prevented by statute from collecting personally identifiable info. Not true of Google Fiber.

miriamgottfried	709466783468617728	2016-03-14T19:50:37	Bmuni83Weiss But what if media cos go direct to consumer and cut out Netflix? Ubben was saying they'll have the power to do that.
miriamgottfried	709463932587610112	2016-03-14T19:39:17	amitdillo Yeah, that's pretty subjective. I mean, if you base it on critical acclaim or Emmys, other nets still have lots of good shows.

miriamgottfried	709462477919096833	2016-03-14T19:33:30	Chris_Ciaccia He was talking about media companies going direct to consumer. His point was that they don't need aggregators.
miriamgottfried	709462366681849856	2016-03-14T19:33:04	amitdillo True, and CNBC asked him about that. But Netflix still relies heavily on other people's content.
miriamgottfried	709462058526502913	2016-03-14T19:31:50	Chris_Ciaccia It was preceded by a question from Kelly about his feelings on Netflix. Ubben said he didn't like Netflix.
miriamgottfried	709461426512007168	2016-03-14T19:29:19	Ubben of ValueAct prefers media cos like FOXA over NFLX, w idea that content owners will be more powerful than aggregators in Internet TV.

miriamgottfried	709425127298048000	2016-03-14T17:05:05	CalebMelby Makes sense
miriamgottfried	709424520738820096	2016-03-14T17:02:40	Another point: Stock-price declines can be related to factors outside management control. That makes performance vs peers more meaningful.
miriamgottfried	709424299761913856	2016-03-14T17:01:48	Tying exec comp to stock price is more controversial than I thought. People pointing out it creates disincentive to take needed risks.

miriamgottfried	691740650379857920	2016-01-25T21:53:17	eric_analytics tomfgoodwin Agree. But that fragmentation makes it difficult for Apple to capture much more value from the TV ecosystem.
