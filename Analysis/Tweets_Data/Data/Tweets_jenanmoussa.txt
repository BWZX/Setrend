jenanmoussa	708022506393886720	2016-03-10T20:11:34	So in this context, using the word "killing" rather than "martyrdom" is logical. It does not contradict IS-ideology.
jenanmoussa	708022226474369024	2016-03-10T20:10:27	Basically, they dont want 2 sit in God's place by saying somebody is a martyr. IS believes it is up to God to decide if someone is a martyr.
jenanmoussa	708021830485995524	2016-03-10T20:08:53	IS never called any of its dead fighters a martyr. They say in Arabic: "We consider him accepted by God as martyr: نحسبه عند الله شهيد'

jenanmoussa	707957017219112960	2016-03-10T15:51:20	IS docs: some analysts pointing to spelling mistakes in forms. Don't forget some fighters have only elementary/ high school education. &gt;
