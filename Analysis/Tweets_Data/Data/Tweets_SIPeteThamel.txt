SIPeteThamel	716417425533571072	2016-04-03T00:09:59	Syracuse isn't exactly an underdog from central casting. But will Nova fans and neutral fans rally behind them tonight?
SIPeteThamel	716416431684866048	2016-04-03T00:06:02	Before we overreact about Buddy Hield's NBA stock, remember Dwyane Wade's college career ended in a Final Four blowout.
SIPeteThamel	716415515510505472	2016-04-03T00:02:23	There are AAU teams appalled at Oklahoma's defensive intensity
SIPeteThamel	716415736470642688	2016-04-03T00:03:16	Sometimes sports don't make sense. Oklahoma blew out A&amp;M and Oregon last week. Now, a suffer a historic Final Four loss. 90-49
SIPeteThamel	716410261792358401	2016-04-02T23:41:31	He drips with potential. Loved watching him at Big East Tournament. There's a pinch of Hakim Warrick in that frame.

SIPeteThamel	716398274685440000	2016-04-02T22:53:53	Nova shooting 66.7-percent from the field. Somewhere Ed Pinckney is smiling.
SIPeteThamel	716397774086901760	2016-04-02T22:51:54	Nova leads Oklahoma 42-28. Jay Wright's plan to make this more of a business trip than a joyride appears to have worked.
SIPeteThamel	716388616562286592	2016-04-02T22:15:30	The book on Buddy is to force him to become a playmaker. He had 0 assists and 6 turnovers against Oregon. (But he scored 37.....)

SIPeteThamel	715619607176843264	2016-03-31T19:19:44	Classic Boeheim. Sarcasm. Swearing. Deprecation. Attempted to distinguish NCAA cheating from rule violating. Always. Fills. Notebook.

SIPeteThamel	714421492268867584	2016-03-28T11:58:51	How do you explain the inexplicable? BrianHamiltonSI gives this impossible Syracuse team a shot.  
SIPeteThamel	714291534762549251	2016-03-28T03:22:27	Houston, we have our matchups.  
SIPeteThamel	714287803710967809	2016-03-28T03:07:37	SU is playing in Indianapolis and Houston. That costs a lot of money for travel. Donate to The D.O. travel fund! 
SIPeteThamel	714274897032318976	2016-03-28T02:16:20	Sticking with the Burn paid off. ND will be loose, just like Cuse.

SIPeteThamel	714247627152498690	2016-03-28T00:27:59	Charles Barkley thinks Syracuse would be better playing man-to-man instead of zone. Must have missed the Le Moyne game.
SIPeteThamel	714246338809081856	2016-03-28T00:22:51	A 16-point deficit against UVA is like a 25-point deficit against anyone else. Richardson had a day for the ages. 
SIPeteThamel	714244472838733825	2016-03-28T00:15:27	Syracuse is headed to Houston, beats No. 1 Virginia 68-62. First No. 10 seed to ever reach the Final Four.
SIPeteThamel	714243050755727364	2016-03-28T00:09:47	Syracuse and free throws. A tumultuous relationship about to unfold again on a big stage.
SIPeteThamel	714240072262950913	2016-03-27T23:57:57	Syracuse now has pucker power on its side. Cuse is playing loose. UVA flat footed.
SIPeteThamel	714220916998148096	2016-03-27T22:41:50	Syracuse struggles with teams that play UVA's style. I think back to Marquette in Big East days and Pitt. Deliberate and exacting teams.
SIPeteThamel	714219624988971009	2016-03-27T22:36:42	This perfectly sums up this game so far. Cuse on offense an exercise in futility.

SIPeteThamel	713877807470751745	2016-03-26T23:58:27	Oklahoma was stalling on offense and looking a bit harried. Then Buddy drains the dagger. 73-57. He's got 33 on 18 shots.
SIPeteThamel	713873144000327680	2016-03-26T23:39:55	Expect Oregon to make a push here. They are only down 14, and Buddy has to be human for a stretch. Right?
SIPeteThamel	713871776103542785	2016-03-26T23:34:29	Brooks just returned with 3 fouls. He's been invisible today for Oregon. They need his energy down 61-44.
SIPeteThamel	713871089672134656	2016-03-26T23:31:45	Nineteenth time this year Buddy has scored at least 25. NINETEENTH.
SIPeteThamel	713871130017144832	2016-03-26T23:31:55	Buddy has 26 in just over 25 minutes. He's done it on 13 shots. Let the show continue.
SIPeteThamel	713870065959997441	2016-03-26T23:27:41	Nothing left to say about Buddy. He's been resplendent. He has 23 on 9-12 shooting. Sooners lead 56-41.
SIPeteThamel	713868934353657856	2016-03-26T23:23:11	If Oklahoma advances to Final Four, Lon Kruger will coach Final Four teams 22 years apart. Second only to DePaul's Ray Meyer, 36 years apart

SIPeteThamel	713862086695084033	2016-03-26T22:55:59	Oregon is pressing out of desperation and..... no bueno. OU slicing and dicing and leads 45-28. Brooks has two fouls.
SIPeteThamel	713859534872162304	2016-03-26T22:45:50	Buddy Hield is not off. He just drilled a 3 and held his follow through. Buddy is art. He's got 14. OU up 37-21.
SIPeteThamel	713859239295365120	2016-03-26T22:44:40	Dillon Brooks has been quiet for Oregon. Two points. No rebounds. He did just rip Hield, but he's off today.
SIPeteThamel	713855877212545025	2016-03-26T22:31:18	Great point by Clark. Buddy's impact transcends the crazy 3s.  
SIPeteThamel	713852209289531392	2016-03-26T22:16:44	Buddy Ball: NBA 3, a downright silly stepback 3 and then a putback where he grabbed board with left hand. Finished with right. 12-8 OU.

SIPeteThamel	713178337225482240	2016-03-25T01:39:00	No comeback for Texas A&amp;M this time. And not much pulse. Sooners roll the Aggies, 77-63. Buddy with 17. Woodard with 22.

SIPeteThamel	713158590815555584	2016-03-25T00:20:32	Texas A&amp;M has eight field goals. Or just two more than in the final 34 seconds against Northern Iowa.
SIPeteThamel	713157682375450624	2016-03-25T00:16:55	Not a whole lot of skill or sophistication to Texas A&amp;M on offense. They've scored nine in past 11 minutes.
SIPeteThamel	713155942909485060	2016-03-25T00:10:01	OU jumps out 32-22. Kennedy calls time out, as Aggies have gone flat. Woodard leads OU with nine. Buddy has 5.

SIPeteThamel	711295384199557121	2016-03-19T20:56:49	Valiant effort by Yale. Cut a 27-point lead to a one-possession game. But not quite enough. Talented but flawed Duke advances, 71-64.
SIPeteThamel	711294252987318276	2016-03-19T20:52:19	I believe March tipped in that Yale free throw, which cut the Duke lead to 3. Ingram calmly swishes 2 to answer.
SIPeteThamel	711292776185536513	2016-03-19T20:46:27	Makai Mason has seven assists. But he's 0-4 from 3, and that one will haunt him. Couldn't have been more open.

SIPeteThamel	711287960617013249	2016-03-19T20:27:19	Bizarre world when Yale should have pressed Duke more.  
SIPeteThamel	711287063874818048	2016-03-19T20:23:45	Duke went to Ingram on consecutive possessions out of the timeout. He didn't start in the first game. He's come a long way.
SIPeteThamel	711286160656621568	2016-03-19T20:20:10	This would be the biggest comeback in NCAA Tournament history. BYU rallied from 25 down to beat Iona in 2012.

SIPeteThamel	711251756169224193	2016-03-19T18:03:27	If Miami holds on to win, Davon Reed should take a bow. His blocked shot on Kelly and subsequent 3 were double-order onions.
SIPeteThamel	711251233479200769	2016-03-19T18:01:23	Best sign of Miami's ornery D? So many Wichita shots have been taken as shot clock expired. That was another. 55-50 Canes with 3:36 left
SIPeteThamel	711249981269798915	2016-03-19T17:56:24	Miami's age and experience are its biggest strength. McClellan, 23, never flinched. UM leads 52-45.
SIPeteThamel	711247511718141953	2016-03-19T17:46:35	That Rodriguez to McClellan alley oop was of Dunk City difficultly proportions. Miami gets some juice and re-takes lead. 44-43
SIPeteThamel	711246482947633152	2016-03-19T17:42:30	Maybe that T energizes Miami? They need it. Stuck in cruise control after early 21-point lead. 42-40 Canes.

SIPeteThamel	711235626914414592	2016-03-19T16:59:22	Miami heads to halftime up 32-19. All things considered for Wichita, it could be much worse. Miami's D the story. WSU 7-29.

SIPeteThamel	686823936449970176	2016-01-12T08:16:01	Move over, Bear? Saban could be Alabama's most accomplished coach  
SIPeteThamel	686802047279038465	2016-01-12T06:49:02	Clemson was 85-0-1 all time in games gaining at least 500 yards prior to tonite. Had 550 against Alabama's #2 total defense but lost .

SIPeteThamel	686781666015117312	2016-01-12T05:28:03	That's four national titles in seven years for Bama. One of the most impressive runs in college football history.
SIPeteThamel	686774327245680640	2016-01-12T04:58:53	Deshaun Watson has never lost a game that he has started and completed.
SIPeteThamel	686773850084753409	2016-01-12T04:57:00	Alabama has a 38-35 lead. These games always come down to the trenches. And we'll find out real soon who is better and deeper there.
SIPeteThamel	686771813498490880	2016-01-12T04:48:54	Kenyan Drake for 95 yards on the kickoff. Bama leads 38-27, and 4Q special teams will be the story of the game.
SIPeteThamel	686769273218318336	2016-01-12T04:38:48	So the perfect ending here is a Clemson TD and going for 2 to win, right?
SIPeteThamel	686768828697554944	2016-01-12T04:37:02	Saban's on-side kick call may go down as one of the best -- and gutsiest -- decisions in college football history. Big onions.
SIPeteThamel	686766770321899520	2016-01-12T04:28:52	Popular thought was Bama would wear down Clemson. We'll find out soon if that's true.
SIPeteThamel	686760010597044225	2016-01-12T04:02:00	For Clemson to win tonight, Deshaun Watson had to channel a Vince Young  performance. So far, he's having that kind of night. Clemson 24-21
SIPeteThamel	686753231645507585	2016-01-12T03:35:04	More bad news for Clemson. Star CB Alexander is not coming back. Everything trending wrong for Clemson. Can Watson bail them out?
SIPeteThamel	686752999952138240	2016-01-12T03:34:09	Clemson's T.J. Green appeared to freeze there, allowing Bama the gift TD and 21-14 lead. Two huge D busts by Clemson the difference.
SIPeteThamel	686742993634594816	2016-01-12T02:54:23	And they did it again. Clemson gave Bama 30 extra seconds. Let's see if that looms large here.
SIPeteThamel	686742813061431296	2016-01-12T02:53:40	Clemson should have let the final 15 seconds tick off the play clock. That was foolish.

SIPeteThamel	686739201140764672	2016-01-12T02:39:19	Is that big?  
SIPeteThamel	686738910182019073	2016-01-12T02:38:09	Who is Hunter Renfrow?  Get to know the walk-on WR with two TDs for Clemson:  
SIPeteThamel	686737754995068928	2016-01-12T02:33:34	Henry tumbles in from one yard out. What a duel so far of Heisman finalists. Watson two TD passes. Henry has 98 and 2 TDs. Buckle up.
SIPeteThamel	686735980254986241	2016-01-12T02:26:31	In soccer, that would have been a red card. Henry was gone.
SIPeteThamel	686735212235984896	2016-01-12T02:23:28	I'm curious if Clemson adjusts here and stops trying to run up the middle. Only thing that's slowed their offense so far.
SIPeteThamel	686734905263296512	2016-01-12T02:22:14	Ohio State racked up 537 on Bama in the Sugar Bowl last year. Clemson on pace for 588 after first quarter.
SIPeteThamel	686732866030444544	2016-01-12T02:14:08	Watson was straight clinical on that drive. Hits Renfrow for his second TD of the game. Really impressive so far. 14-7 ClemsonFB leads.
SIPeteThamel	686732299312869376	2016-01-12T02:11:53	Those were back-to-back high-end NFL throws by Watson.
SIPeteThamel	686729548658905089	2016-01-12T02:00:57	Watson is an elite thrower of the deep ball. Such touch and polish. Clemson is a "shots" team. And they'll need shots like that to win. 7-7
SIPeteThamel	686727861202374656	2016-01-12T01:54:15	What does the NFL think of Deshaun Watson, the potential first QB off the board in 2017? 
SIPeteThamel	686727443407699968	2016-01-12T01:52:35	Derrick Henry went 50 yards for a Bama touchdown. His dreadlocks may have been the only thing touched on that. Not a good sign.
SIPeteThamel	686725949027569665	2016-01-12T01:46:39	Bama's opponents this year stressed the importance of not bothering to run inside. Doesn't work. Clemson didn't get the memo.

SIPeteThamel	682983864042668032	2016-01-01T17:56:57	Oklahoma CB Zack Sanchez will declare for the NFL draft  
SIPeteThamel	682983231516479488	2016-01-01T17:54:26	The big CFP fumble here was not moving the games this year to Jan. 2. Any defense of that has been comically bad.
SIPeteThamel	682982865592840192	2016-01-01T17:52:59	This was the feedback I got the most on the "New Tradition." Looks to have backfired.  
SIPeteThamel	682982427753603072	2016-01-01T17:51:14	My story on the games going to NYE includes interesting perspective on why ratings matter less on cable. 
SIPeteThamel	682981589463109632	2016-01-01T17:47:54	Early read is that ESPN's NY Eve ratings tanked. Both semis were more than 15 last year. Both below 10 this year. Dick Clark &gt; Nick Saban

SIPeteThamel	682733969071325184	2016-01-01T01:23:57	Bob Stoops just walked into clemson locker room to congratulate Venables. Classy
SIPeteThamel	682711903064440832	2015-12-31T23:56:16	Again, Hunter Renfrow. He’s doing this for him and all his 68 cousins! 
SIPeteThamel	682711872961966080	2015-12-31T23:56:09	Watson just made a big-time pass to Renfro there, who turned the corner for a touchdown. What a bullet. Clemson leads 30-17.
SIPeteThamel	682710107168354304	2015-12-31T23:49:08	Perine just jogged back on the field after being stretched out by trainers. Mixon out for now.
SIPeteThamel	682707185231597568	2015-12-31T23:37:31	Flurries of momentum shifts have defined this game so far. Clemson can deliver a giant swing here after strong D possession.
SIPeteThamel	682706460485259264	2015-12-31T23:34:38	Trainers helping Perine off the field. Looks like a left ankle injury. He has 44 yards on 11 carries and 1 TD.
SIPeteThamel	682705920191807488	2015-12-31T23:32:30	Clemson's D.J. Reader just crushed Perine at line of scrimmage. Perine is down on the ground. Injury looks serious.

SIPeteThamel	682702613993910273	2015-12-31T23:19:21	DE Shaq Lawson will not return for Clemson. Led the nation is TFLs this year. Huge blow. Second best player on Tigers.

SIPeteThamel	682696392264019969	2015-12-31T22:54:38	Watson forced the issue there. Bad decision could well haunt the Tigers. Cost them three points in a 17-16 game.
SIPeteThamel	682694142460309504	2015-12-31T22:45:42	Only bad part of that lightening TD drive by OU is that Clemson has 1:34 and two time outs to answer. Sooners lead 17-16.
