Yair_Rosenberg	722480700704890880	2016-04-19T17:43:16	I cannot imagine why Sanders supporters are having trouble converting skeptics to their cause. 
Yair_Rosenberg	722479464081448960	2016-04-19T17:38:21	There's a weird corner of the Internet where Bernie Sanders is winning and the media is lying to you.

Yair_Rosenberg	722454362421911552	2016-04-19T15:58:37	Ironically, Sanders' campaign is systematically disproving one of its own rationales: that money buys elections

Yair_Rosenberg	722104678415208448	2016-04-18T16:49:06	Unfortunately, not looking like the Jerusalem bus explosion was the result of a technical failure.

Yair_Rosenberg	713385806304567296	2016-03-25T15:23:24	sarahposner PeterBeinart Normally when a group wrongly claims to represent a religious minority, we don't blame the minority.

Yair_Rosenberg	713385210168086528	2016-03-25T15:21:02	sarahposner It's not just the headline. Alleged "Most dominant American Jewish org" doesn't represent American Jews or deliver their votes.

Yair_Rosenberg	713383680195108864	2016-03-25T15:14:58	sarahposner We're saying different things. Of course there's what to criticize *AIPAC* about. Problem is people who attacked American Jews.
Yair_Rosenberg	713383278988935168	2016-03-25T15:13:22	sarahposner But the rabbis did walk out! The point is, AIPAC isn't a Jewish org, it's a pro-Israel one: 
Yair_Rosenberg	713382586404483072	2016-03-25T15:10:37	sarahposner Absolutely! But it needed to be discussed intelligently. This line of argument was not: 
Yair_Rosenberg	713380811966390273	2016-03-25T15:03:34	Those think pieces about AIPAC's Trump reception being an "American Jewish failure" looking pretty dumb right now

Yair_Rosenberg	712115733384339456	2016-03-22T03:16:35	My latest: Why Trump's transformation at AIPAC should scare you  
Yair_Rosenberg	712112837628399616	2016-03-22T03:05:05	Don't really get why Trump bashed the UN. Between the self-important, the incompetent, the corrupt, and the autocratic, he'd fit right in.
Yair_Rosenberg	712111258322018305	2016-03-22T02:58:49	So realDonaldTrump bashed the UN at AIPAC today. But he's called himself a "big, big fan" of the body in the past 
Yair_Rosenberg	712106800783339520	2016-03-22T02:41:06	This is honestly how I understood Clinton's "ugly legacy of last 8 years" too—referred to GOP obstruction, not Obama 
Yair_Rosenberg	712101365909159936	2016-03-22T02:19:30	Trump's speech at AIPAC was the first time I thought he could possibly beat Hillary. That should scare all of us. 
Yair_Rosenberg	712091615125438466	2016-03-22T01:40:45	I didn't actually call Trump a Nazi, but this may be the worst defense against that charge I've ever seen:

Yair_Rosenberg	712078455421149184	2016-03-22T00:48:28	chrislhayes Kudos for asking this question, Chris. BernieSanders
Yair_Rosenberg	712078395761418240	2016-03-22T00:48:13	This is exactly right. Not all Israel boycotters are anti-Semitic, but too many are, and aren't condemned.  
Yair_Rosenberg	712058453968220160	2016-03-21T23:28:59	This is undeniably true: Joe Biden gave a far more honest speech to AIPAC reflecting his true beliefs than Donald Trump
Yair_Rosenberg	712057707906342912	2016-03-21T23:26:01	I expect she'll get 80-85% of Jewish vote based on her familiarity to American Jews + hostility to Trump. 
Yair_Rosenberg	712055270533406720	2016-03-21T23:16:20	There are several signatories to the Iran deal. US partners would not go along with its disavowal.
Yair_Rosenberg	712054852503920645	2016-03-21T23:14:40	Cruz just got a standing ovation from AIPAC for attacking Trump's neutrality on Israel line.
Yair_Rosenberg	712051647866916864	2016-03-21T23:01:56	The bar was so low for Trump today that the fact he can read is winning Twitter right now.
Yair_Rosenberg	712050566411776000	2016-03-21T22:57:38	HalpernAlex No, but applause by some in the hall for pro-Israel cliches does not indicate Jewish recruits to Nazi Twitter...
Yair_Rosenberg	712050263096487936	2016-03-21T22:56:26	HalpernAlex Hillary got just the same reception.
Yair_Rosenberg	712050060645834753	2016-03-21T22:55:38	And Trump concludes his AIPAC speech. Thoughts and prayers to Nazi Twitter at this trying time.
Yair_Rosenberg	712049719078461440	2016-03-21T22:54:16	Crowd gave Hillary multiple standing ovations this morning.   
Yair_Rosenberg	712049323505270784	2016-03-21T22:52:42	Especially considering size of arena in relation to amount of applause 
Yair_Rosenberg	712049467789332480	2016-03-21T22:53:17	When Hillary gets 75% of the Jewish vote (as Democrats do), all the think pieces you'll see about Trump after AIPAC will look pretty silly.
Yair_Rosenberg	712048526746918913	2016-03-21T22:49:32	I look forward to ill-informed stories suggesting that AIPAC applause means Jewish voters might move towards Trump.
Yair_Rosenberg	712048312069853184	2016-03-21T22:48:41	lrozen Just as much, if not more for Hillary. And no one walked out on her.
Yair_Rosenberg	712048192158887940	2016-03-21T22:48:12	When Donald Trump becomes President, he will reinstitute torture in the form of subjecting captured combatants to this speech on loop.
Yair_Rosenberg	712047907982204928	2016-03-21T22:47:05	So what happens when the lady Trump supporter with the white power tattoos hears about this speech for the Jewish lobby? AIPAC2016
Yair_Rosenberg	712047271592984576	2016-03-21T22:44:33	Hillary said she'd oppose an imposed UN resolution this morning too. 
Yair_Rosenberg	712046884983062528	2016-03-21T22:43:01	One huge problem of reporters parachuting in for Trump: they have no basis for comparing his reception to Hillary's or anyone else's.
Yair_Rosenberg	712045776369750016	2016-03-21T22:38:36	This feeling of incredulity and dread you feel at Trump playing a politician is going to be so much worse if he gets to debate Hillary.
Yair_Rosenberg	712044879229153281	2016-03-21T22:35:03	As I've said, the sole silver lining of this Trump speech at AIPAC is that it is driving his neo-Nazi supporters berserk.
Yair_Rosenberg	712044091178151937	2016-03-21T22:31:55	Trump reading from a teleprompter makes him seem more like a real politician in that it forces him to angle his head the same way they do
Yair_Rosenberg	712043764970340357	2016-03-21T22:30:37	People are walking out as Trump enters. Can see them at all the exits. Most remain seated.

Yair_Rosenberg	712041593025519616	2016-03-21T22:21:59	My understanding is that when all the GOP candidates are on stage, AIPAC will lower a cage &amp; have them fight it out 
Yair_Rosenberg	712040044995940354	2016-03-21T22:15:50	lizaveta9 I know you're not really interested in the answer, but this is it: 
Yair_Rosenberg	712039192965095426	2016-03-21T22:12:27	zackbeauchamp As ever, Israel plays a symbolic, totemic role in broader worldview. Feelings about Israel often reflect those about US role.
Yair_Rosenberg	712037714506416130	2016-03-21T22:06:34	This is why cutting Israeli aid is such a non-starter in Congress. It would cut American jobs.  
Yair_Rosenberg	712036469137920000	2016-03-21T22:01:37	AIPAC video on US aid to Israel notes 75% of it is spent in America, a fact always omitted by Israel's detractors who accuse it of mooching.

Yair_Rosenberg	711923479977795585	2016-03-21T14:32:39	Hillary just killed it at AIPAC.

Yair_Rosenberg	711890287694581760	2016-03-21T12:20:45	Today, 3 hours from now, we are burying my cousin, Yonatan (Yoni) Suher, who was murdered at the terror attack in Istanbul two days ago.

Yair_Rosenberg	711730267942219776	2016-03-21T01:44:53	EFRalph Basically, Israel has similar poll numbers on Hillary vs. Trump to America, which shows they have something in common...
Yair_Rosenberg	711729925275967489	2016-03-21T01:43:32	EFRalph True. But at the very least, the headline is a slander on Israel and its people. He loses to HRC by *double digits* in the polls.
Yair_Rosenberg	711728432934166528	2016-03-21T01:37:36	jessicaschulb I wouldn't have complained if he didn't. It's a great story.

Yair_Rosenberg	711725433100886018	2016-03-21T01:25:41	EFRalph "Israelis Love Trump" is the rare trend story that is, in fact, the very opposite of the documented trend.
Yair_Rosenberg	711725272081506304	2016-03-21T01:25:02	EFRalph And obviously Trump is second. Most Israelis don't know who any of the other Republican candidates are! Largely name recognition.
Yair_Rosenberg	711725098537984000	2016-03-21T01:24:21	EFRalph Missed that! Thanks. Of course, there's another one (bottom here):

Yair_Rosenberg	711717740248219649	2016-03-21T00:55:07	Wow, Joe Biden basically runs into the AIPAC arena and onto the stage. We should all be half as irrepressible as he is in our seventies.
Yair_Rosenberg	711716049033555968	2016-03-21T00:48:23	What are the chances Joe Biden tells AIPAC2016 his story about meeting Golda Meir?
Yair_Rosenberg	711714822656802818	2016-03-21T00:43:31	ashirak Pretty sure they both were on the main stage. The rabbi spoke, though not to tell a story (none of the faith leaders did).
Yair_Rosenberg	711714500379066368	2016-03-21T00:42:14	Hey AIPAC, your internet in the press section is absolutely terrible for PCs. Please fix by tomorrow. Sincerely, the press. AIPAC2016

Yair_Rosenberg	711712843339571201	2016-03-21T00:35:39	AIPAC has so far featured African-Americans, Latinos &amp; WWII heroes, celebrating America &amp; its diversity—pretty much opposite of Trump rally

Yair_Rosenberg	711690242542202881	2016-03-20T23:05:51	If you think AIPAC looks insane now, just wait until Donald Trump enters on a flying hoverboard from the ceiling.

Yair_Rosenberg	711634236571258880	2016-03-20T19:23:18	Well, he kind of makes AIPAC's point about shared American and Israeli interests for them.

Yair_Rosenberg	706899295811858432	2016-03-07T17:48:20	Very unlikely, but smart play for Rubio given his poor Michigan polling would be to tell his backers there to vote Cruz/Kasich to beat Trump

Yair_Rosenberg	705599173748531200	2016-03-04T03:42:07	The Cruz "breath and count to 10" routine works on Trump because it infantilizes him. Treats him like a child rather than a candidate.
Yair_Rosenberg	705593565259440128	2016-03-04T03:19:49	Kasich seems to have saved his best material for a less-crowded stage when there would actually be space to be heard.
Yair_Rosenberg	705589572349136896	2016-03-04T03:03:57	Trump forgot the other questions just like he forgot what he said on all those issues. Ask him if he's senile!
Yair_Rosenberg	705588109401038848	2016-03-04T02:58:09	So Trump is becoming more liberal on immigration, more lawless on executive powers, and more barbaric on torture just in this debate.
Yair_Rosenberg	705587651638902784	2016-03-04T02:56:19	Whenever Trump says "right from the beginning, I said..." whatever follows is always a lie.

Yair_Rosenberg	705583060989964288	2016-03-04T02:38:05	Trump has so much respect for the off the record process that he called the media "the most disgusting people" he knows.

Yair_Rosenberg	705475080369922050	2016-03-03T19:29:00	Note to media: Trump made his risque reference b/c he doesn't want to talk about Romney's attacks. Be sure to point this out and list them.

Yair_Rosenberg	704144770772369409	2016-02-29T03:22:50	The idea that Rubio should just sit back and do nothing about the giant press imbalance in terms of coverage is laughable.

Yair_Rosenberg	703309185849626625	2016-02-26T20:02:31	eddlest PatrickRuffini Thanks! This is why if I'm Rubio, I just keep doing what I'm doing, competing with Trump for media attention.
Yair_Rosenberg	703306470562111488	2016-02-26T19:51:44	State of play is still the same: Rubio needs to blanket the upcoming primary states with anti-Trump messaging, keep grabbing media attention
Yair_Rosenberg	703305120340115456	2016-02-26T19:46:22	Maybe we should stop taking the conventional wisdom about this election seriously and just stop Trump. 
Yair_Rosenberg	703303911705186305	2016-02-26T19:41:33	From the way a lot of Democrats talk about Trump, you’d think he was 20 points behind Clinton in a head to head, instead of …. 3.
Yair_Rosenberg	703303821120954368	2016-02-26T19:41:12	Liberal idea that it's worth risking Trump in general election b/c Hillary has good chance of beating him is insane

Yair_Rosenberg	703300093731082240	2016-02-26T19:26:23	Like Trump, Christie's insults are invariably projections of his own failings onto others

Yair_Rosenberg	703291237433008129	2016-02-26T18:51:12	It's time to stop dismissing Trump as a crazy buffoon.  He's deadly serious about this "President Trump" stuff.
Yair_Rosenberg	703290437344301056	2016-02-26T18:48:01	chrislhayes Sounds about right, but Christie is obviously Secretary of Transportation
Yair_Rosenberg	703289224217370624	2016-02-26T18:43:12	Would Rubio campaign counter Christie w/ a big Jeb+Romney+? endorsement, to keep establishment in line? Or do they not want the association?

Yair_Rosenberg	703283864828047360	2016-02-26T18:21:54	A Trump-Christie administration is more disturbing than just a Trump one. They both have no scruples, but Christie is actually competent.
Yair_Rosenberg	703282880114511873	2016-02-26T18:17:59	Well, one thing's for sure: if Marco Rubio gets the nomination, he will have earned it.

Yair_Rosenberg	703280026322661377	2016-02-26T18:06:39	Christie going after Rubio over and over without even mentioning Cruz is cementing Rubio as the anti-Trump alternative, for what it's worth.
Yair_Rosenberg	703277323139870720	2016-02-26T17:55:54	One wonders if any of Christie's former staff who took the fall for him for Bridgegate will come forward after this.

Yair_Rosenberg	703264310915682304	2016-02-26T17:04:12	Oh man, Rubio reads and mocks Donald Trump's mean tweets about him, misspellings and all, at campaign rally

Yair_Rosenberg	703217252259250180	2016-02-26T13:57:12	Guys, I think Rubio broke the Donald. He's steadily losing control of the English language.

Yair_Rosenberg	703205804648824832	2016-02-26T13:11:43	Trump chokes attempting to go after Rubio, misspells "chocker" 
Yair_Rosenberg	703198805055971328	2016-02-26T12:43:54	Rubio’s attacks on Trump aren’t about swaying Trump voters. They’re about swaying everyone else.

Yair_Rosenberg	703087004557434880	2016-02-26T05:19:39	What Rubio meant, of course, is if you approach Israel-Palestine like a real estate deal, leaving out history, religion, etc, you will fail.
Yair_Rosenberg	703079205312065536	2016-02-26T04:48:39	Also, with Rubio succeeding where Jeb failed against Trump, tonight was more evidence that he was the superior candidate all along.

Yair_Rosenberg	692821482041401344	2016-01-28T21:28:07	drewlevin I actually had line in the origin draft that got cut about how gays/Roma/dissidents underscore the universalist message.

Yair_Rosenberg	692819486307663872	2016-01-28T21:20:12	drewlevin Seriously, you're welcome to defend commemorating the Holocaust without mentioning Jews. I doubt you'll find many takers.
Yair_Rosenberg	692818109506457600	2016-01-28T21:14:43	drewlevin I'd have written the exact same thing if someone had decided to commemorate slavery without mentioning blacks. Same principle.

Yair_Rosenberg	692813602248597505	2016-01-28T20:56:49	drewlevin Regardless, idea that one would commemorate the Holocaust w/o mentioning Jews is as odd as recalling slavery and omitting blacks
Yair_Rosenberg	692812892245221376	2016-01-28T20:54:00	drewlevin If you want to argue the death toll of Jews across millenia of history is equivalent to other groups, that's a hard case to make.
