alexismadrigal	716133781426429954	2016-04-02T05:22:53	Celtics are good. And they have the kind of lineup that gives the Ws fits: multiple guards who can drive + stretch big men.

alexismadrigal	705953647193001984	2016-03-05T03:10:40	dansinker I wonder if it is better captured by industry or tech
alexismadrigal	705953549801299968	2016-03-05T03:10:16	dansinker it's interesting how different the spin is: I was thinking of the big Boorstin book about American tech
alexismadrigal	705953256158031872	2016-03-05T03:09:06	Dan_E_Solo it's a good question. Few would go at all 3. I can't even think of anyone really (except Pynchon as someone pointed out)
alexismadrigal	705953046539276288	2016-03-05T03:08:16	tcarmody I hear that. One thing that seems more clear to me now: it was the ~50-75 yr threat of re-colonization that drove so much
alexismadrigal	705952749049946112	2016-03-05T03:07:05	BrevetCaptain the almost missing concept might be "nature," but maybe you back into it via tech

alexismadrigal	705952422305214464	2016-03-05T03:05:48	dansinker that's interesting: I thought about quantification replacing tech in that tweet. Industry is an interesting shift.
alexismadrigal	705952243841798144	2016-03-05T03:05:05	tcarmody the weird thing for me is: does the revolution explain as much as it seems it should? The longer I go, the less it seems to

alexismadrigal	696016450100695041	2016-02-06T17:03:47	BenedictEvans the problem, as I see it, is the feeing that one could be attacked at any time. Leads to disinvestment and disengagement

alexismadrigal	696010934565744640	2016-02-06T16:41:52	I still believe that. Can Twitter the product fulfill that potential? Will it the become the noosphere? A real time network of minds?

alexismadrigal	693665462098395137	2016-01-31T05:21:48	tcarmody in the new NBA world, the ideal Bron lineup might be: Kyrie, Smith, 6'8" wing guy, Bron, athletic center?
alexismadrigal	693665054785318912	2016-01-31T05:20:11	tcarmody Mozgov, Varejao, Love, Thompson... And yet those guys take up a huge chunk of their budget

alexismadrigal	693664717487738880	2016-01-31T05:18:50	tcarmody there have rumblings for a while, but it's mostly that they have too many expensive big slow guys
alexismadrigal	693664523211792384	2016-01-31T05:18:04	YAppelbaum that makes for some truly brutal reading
alexismadrigal	693662377313611776	2016-01-31T05:09:33	tcarmody still missing the right 3 though. Maybe a 3 way deal: Mozgov for Deng, Crowder or Bazemore?
alexismadrigal	693660893960253440	2016-01-31T05:03:39	tcarmody Mozgov is worth nothing to the Clips tho
alexismadrigal	693659793345552384	2016-01-31T04:59:16	tcarmody they obviously wouldn't want to give up Drummond

alexismadrigal	693652179505123328	2016-01-31T04:29:01	So who is the best player the Cavs could get for Mozgov?

alexismadrigal	693458637650468864	2016-01-30T15:39:57	YagoColas my bet/hope is that Steph being so open with Riley will make it easier for other NBA dads. Remember the shit he got for it?
