eminiplayer	685118702254084098	2016-01-07T15:20:02	Yep. Big move already took place overnight. Now we're just playing the high-probability reactions as ES consolidates 
eminiplayer	685118418219999234	2016-01-07T15:18:54	Same here. Got filled at 60.50 (resting order), out at 52.50 for +4R. Also shorted 58 with wider stop, scratched it 
eminiplayer	685118062912131072	2016-01-07T15:17:29	31 is a stretch (low odds). The highest odds target was 53. Below 52-53, 45-49.50 (opening range) and 38-39 extended 
eminiplayer	685115305866076160	2016-01-07T15:06:32	From today's plan: " 1958-1960 and 1965-1968 are high-odds Short setups on first test."
eminiplayer	685115021567770624	2016-01-07T15:05:24	58-61 Zone $$
eminiplayer	685112702541234176	2016-01-07T14:56:11	Break of 53 is needed for some downside acceleration. 58-61 Zone working nicely.

eminiplayer	684788938834194432	2016-01-06T17:29:40	I personally didn't trade on the Long side today but captured some very nice Short trades off the Resistance Zones. Every Zone provided edge
eminiplayer	684788294794649600	2016-01-06T17:27:06	Important to remain flexible and plan for 2-3 high-odds scenarios along with the signals that would alert you to which scenario is in-play
eminiplayer	684787907236741120	2016-01-06T17:25:34	Buyers showed up in force off the open and the balancing at lower prices scenario played out.
eminiplayer	684787808037277696	2016-01-06T17:25:10	But in the event that Buyers showed up, Sellers would still likely be active at Resistance and ES could then balance at lower prices.
eminiplayer	684787659084972033	2016-01-06T17:24:35	Today's trade plan was Bearish but cautioned that Buyers could be active off that LTF support at 72.25
