TheRickWilson	720974327982747649	2016-04-15T13:57:29	TheRickWilson nypost I think you're wrong about that, pretty sure Trump's spray tan booth has a 'presidential' setting.

TheRickWilson	720974153105453056	2016-04-15T13:56:47	6/ Nothing in Trump's record indicates this is true. Literally, nothing.  
TheRickWilson	720973634282590212	2016-04-15T13:54:44	By which we mean "every level" 
TheRickWilson	720973531157295104	2016-04-15T13:54:19	Indeed 
TheRickWilson	720972359235170304	2016-04-15T13:49:40	therickwilson nypost sonnybunch Great endorsement: “he’s a lying jackass but its totally just an act or something”.

TheRickWilson	720973134422216704	2016-04-15T13:52:44	5/ The Evil Establishment. The wily mandarins of CHY-na. The Mexican rapist army. Megyn Kelly. 75% of his TL is "Whaaa I'm a victim!"
TheRickWilson	720972690962673665	2016-04-15T13:50:59	4/ Laugh line: "He’s challenging the victim culture"...Trump's endless whine is nothing BUT a complaint about imagined victimization.

TheRickWilson	720971784015781888	2016-04-15T13:47:22	3/ The Post, reflecting the sensibility that informs Trumpisma, flatly admits he's an uninformed, dangerous a-hole. They. Don't. Care.
TheRickWilson	720971225665822720	2016-04-15T13:45:09	2/ In what world does anyone expect Trump to magically become "less thin-skinned." It's definitional to his character.
TheRickWilson	720970937592635394	2016-04-15T13:44:01	1/ nypost endorsement is absurd. One doesn't wave a wand and become "more presidential"  
TheRickWilson	720970185864253440	2016-04-15T13:41:01	Correct. It wasn't even close to Trump's voice.

TheRickWilson	717065825820282880	2016-04-04T19:06:29	7. No matter how much I denounce racists, the left will never love me. True enough. Somehow I will still find the will to live.
TheRickWilson	717065234784059392	2016-04-04T19:04:09	6. Statistics showing lower crime, higher income, education prove whites are superior to blacks. Also that Asians are the Master Race.
TheRickWilson	717064937256960004	2016-04-04T19:02:58	5. Everything lefty historians ever said about the Founders being racists was totally true. But we're the only alternative to the left!
TheRickWilson	717064787105095683	2016-04-04T19:02:22	4. Yeah, well, blacks care about racial identity, and so do the Joooos! So why not whites? Because Tu Quoque is a totally valid argument.
TheRickWilson	717064533303562240	2016-04-04T19:01:21	3. Alt-righters don't care if I call them racist, as they tell me over and over in angry responses to my article calling them racists.
TheRickWilson	717064319163359232	2016-04-04T19:00:30	2. I denounce alt-right because I'm a filthy Jew. Or "goyim traitor." One of the two. But it's totally wrong to say alt-right are racists.
TheRickWilson	717064184119341056	2016-04-04T18:59:58	1. Photos of black people are scary. Photos of whites among blacks are super-scary. But it's totally wrong to say alt-right are racists.
