DowdEdward	724374271020015618	2016-04-24T23:07:39	k1tCapital got it. We did not make new highs.
DowdEdward	724372287609163776	2016-04-24T22:59:46	k1tCapital this is very bullish otherwise.
DowdEdward	724370866260205568	2016-04-24T22:54:07	k1tCapital in the long term. Not the short term.
DowdEdward	724370720399085568	2016-04-24T22:53:32	k1tCapital looks like being bearish is foolish.
DowdEdward	724360379900391424	2016-04-24T22:12:27	Eternity100000 if they don't then highs are not in.
DowdEdward	724360023426502657	2016-04-24T22:11:02	OntheMoneyUK risk Reward not favorable.
DowdEdward	724358281624358913	2016-04-24T22:04:06	Eternity100000 both? To get new high?  Are you expecting that.
DowdEdward	724356938901782528	2016-04-24T21:58:46	Eternity100000 so Vxx needs to make new low this week below 15.48
DowdEdward	724356156391452672	2016-04-24T21:55:40	Eternity100000 so if Vxx makes new low we get highs. If not we may top. Got it.
DowdEdward	724352639857627136	2016-04-24T21:41:41	Eternity100000 so the rule is if they don't then the top may be in.
DowdEdward	724272730942525440	2016-04-24T16:24:10	TheEuchre same.
DowdEdward	724250983312687106	2016-04-24T14:57:45	ggreenwald I saw a report once that showed they over time have given more to Dems.
DowdEdward	724054291724410880	2016-04-24T01:56:10	Eternity100000 so Vxx can't break below 52 week low of 15.48 but UVXY does then top is in. If we get new low in Vxx then top is not in?
