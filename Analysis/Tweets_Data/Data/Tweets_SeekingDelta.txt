SeekingDelta	695287791572406272	2016-02-04T16:48:21	EconomPic I'm with you re: "everyone's active" no argument there. I simply meant w/r/t "dry powder" that's less of a reason for me.
SeekingDelta	695287061960593408	2016-02-04T16:45:28	EconomPic Yes
SeekingDelta	695286641745870848	2016-02-04T16:43:47	EconomPic But not everyone has a lot of activity. I didn't mean active vs. passive....i meant it in the sense of the # of changes 1 makes.
SeekingDelta	695286307686322176	2016-02-04T16:42:28	EconomPic Nothing is without risk but i do view it as low risk for those w/out a short time horizon.
SeekingDelta	695286085161721856	2016-02-04T16:41:35	EconomPic You are probably more active than I.
SeekingDelta	695285896271257600	2016-02-04T16:40:50	EconomPic For me it's much closer to zero.
SeekingDelta	695285414001819650	2016-02-04T16:38:55	EconomPic Yes, Japan is probably the cutoff.
SeekingDelta	695284772197818368	2016-02-04T16:36:22	EconomPic True. IMO a strategic allocation to Int term bond provides both protection and yield.
SeekingDelta	695283876848078848	2016-02-04T16:32:48	EconomPic True, but Agg is north of 2% so, it's still a sizable diff. If rates rise is a big IF...we've been waiting on that for awhile.
SeekingDelta	695281315290152961	2016-02-04T16:22:37	EconomPic Unless you have a very short time horizon, why give up 1%? Agg yields 2+% currently as well.
