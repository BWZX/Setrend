Annaleen	723366915993817090	2016-04-22T04:24:46	thelancearthur good point
Annaleen	723366771370000385	2016-04-22T04:24:12	tcarmody I mean where the "tension" is that the guy is always showing off and the woman comes to accept this failing because love.

Annaleen	719333053919731712	2016-04-11T01:15:39	Just saw Hardcore Henry and it was perfect. A no-nonsense goofball violence film, not trying to be anything but a cartoony cyborg beatdown.

Annaleen	687060544398819329	2016-01-12T23:56:13	trekonomics Noahpinion Both are worth paying attention to, though.
Annaleen	687060416128667648	2016-01-12T23:55:42	trekonomics Noahpinion But debate/social exchange online is also severely constrained by many forces: social, economic, infrastructural.
Annaleen	687060232451670016	2016-01-12T23:54:59	trekonomics Noahpinion I think one of the pernicious myths of the internet is that the “social” part sets us free from hegemony.
Annaleen	687060028541435904	2016-01-12T23:54:10	trekonomics Noahpinion But ideology can be social and interactive. Think of the panopticon.

Annaleen	687058934520102912	2016-01-12T23:49:49	Noahpinion also I think there are hegemonies on the internet … Facebook would be one, with its ideas about what constitutes “a life."
Annaleen	687058596547264512	2016-01-12T23:48:29	trekonomics Noahpinion Habermas nerd = yay
Annaleen	687058478674755584	2016-01-12T23:48:00	Noahpinion ah so I think you mean hegemony, not ideology … (sorry Marxist nerd)
Annaleen	687057548650872832	2016-01-12T23:44:19	Noahpinion But … that’s still ideology. Indeed, the notion that one can create a bespoke ideology is perfect example of internet ideology.
Annaleen	687056935938465792	2016-01-12T23:41:53	Noahpinion So…you think we’re outside ideology now? With pure, unfettered access to universal truth? I’m confused.
Annaleen	687056510547922944	2016-01-12T23:40:11	trekonomics Noahpinion To the extent that the internet expresses our culture, it has to be ideological, no?
