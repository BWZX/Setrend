s1moncox	725171806886305793	2016-04-27T03:56:46	prchovanec I'd say poor wages are analogous to negative investment returns. Unemployment is more analogous to stuffing cash in the mattress

s1moncox	725170828917243904	2016-04-27T03:52:53	prchovanec Wages can send signals. Also, there can be lots of gross job losses without a net rise in unemployment.
s1moncox	725165659634700288	2016-04-27T03:32:20	ANicholson_IG I'd argue that unemployment can be (sadly) necessary to curb excessive wage inflation.
s1moncox	725165207102849026	2016-04-27T03:30:32	ANicholson_IG But then we'd be seeing strong wage inflation in other sectors that need workers but can't get them because they're at SOEs.
s1moncox	725163699242196992	2016-04-27T03:24:33	prchovanec Unemployment represents a failure to allocate resources at all, not a failure to allocate them well.

s1moncox	725162428988809216	2016-04-27T03:19:30	ANicholson_IG You can switch jobs without falling into unemployment first.
s1moncox	725161730381348864	2016-04-27T03:16:44	markerdmann In any case, inflation is subdued, which suggests underemployment or wages not outstripping productivity.

s1moncox	725158997406437376	2016-04-27T03:05:52	Dear China-watchers: under what conditions is unemployment more efficient than employment in an overcapacity sector?
s1moncox	725115171170074625	2016-04-27T00:11:43	Wolf_InTheWilds Only because if the outflow is big enough (relative to past reserve accumulation) it'll put downward pressure on the yuan
s1moncox	725002760450514944	2016-04-26T16:45:02	zerohedge The math is wrong. Q1 capital outflows were presumably bigger than the $118bn fall in reserves but were offset by CA surplus IIF
s1moncox	724978797993295872	2016-04-26T15:09:49	FinanceCam Hidden capital outflows are disguised as imports not exports (or they presumably appear in net errors &amp; omissions)
s1moncox	724977640919035905	2016-04-26T15:05:13	FinanceCam It seems to me ZH argument rests on failing to count the current-account surplus

s1moncox	724520438886330368	2016-04-25T08:48:28	ryanavent OK. But then you are one of v.few people who think China may stagnate because Beijing lacks the political will to stimulate.
s1moncox	724519269547925504	2016-04-25T08:43:49	ryanavent (FWIW bears are equally prone to arguing that China is different: eg hi saving &amp; investment=bad; monetary easing=deflation.)
s1moncox	724517203970646016	2016-04-25T08:35:36	ryanavent If bank nationalisation would've helped in the US, why not in China? If labour mobility would've helped in EU, why not in China?
s1moncox	724515222694711296	2016-04-25T08:27:44	ryanavent I believe China is subject to the same economic principles as everywhere else.
s1moncox	724504572937551872	2016-04-25T07:45:25	macropru2 ryanavent Hukou can be relaxed. But it mostly stops people accessing public services. Plenty of people still move for jobs.
s1moncox	724501664502284288	2016-04-25T07:33:52	ryanavent Eg it was hard for Europe to reallocate labour. But China's workforce is mind-bogglingly mobile.
s1moncox	724500937604132864	2016-04-25T07:30:58	ryanavent Eg it was hard for Japan to cut interest rates far enough below the neutral rate. But China's neutral rate is presumably higher.
s1moncox	724500438557450241	2016-04-25T07:28:59	ryanavent Eg, it was hard for the US to nationalise the banks &amp; unclog credit. I'm fully confident China can nationalise the banks.
s1moncox	724498322526892032	2016-04-25T07:20:35	ryanavent Several of the reasons it's been hard for other countries don't apply in China
s1moncox	724496985965756416	2016-04-25T07:15:16	ryanavent History also offers few egs of catchup economies with trade surpluses &amp; little fx debt that suffer Japan-style liquidity traps.
s1moncox	724495941424697344	2016-04-25T07:11:07	ryanavent They've done it before. But it's fair to say I'm less confident than I was before they let nominal growth slow so dramatically.
s1moncox	724492623520493568	2016-04-25T06:57:56	ryanavent TBF China has only just begun to suffer the dire fate the FT describes. Thus Beijing has only just begun to respond as I describe
s1moncox	724484084492173317	2016-04-25T06:24:00	BaldingsWorld Agreed. That's one reason why I'd have preferred bigger tax cuts &amp; social-spending hikes to keep growth at potential
s1moncox	724479130176090112	2016-04-25T06:04:19	BaldingsWorld There's a useful micro/macro distinction at stake here that you might be neglecting
s1moncox	724477177547255808	2016-04-25T05:56:33	BaldingsWorld peter_tl I don't think that's the claim. It's more like: can China's SOEs/SOBs be made more rational without crisis?
s1moncox	724476053515694080	2016-04-25T05:52:05	hzsong Yes, FAI of SOEs was very strong in q1. But FAI is not GCF and I don't think we yet know what happened to GCF in 2015.

s1moncox	724474509059710976	2016-04-25T05:45:57	hzsong There is some level of AD that can prevent broad deflation even in an economy suffering from overcapacity in several industries.
s1moncox	724473148649824256	2016-04-25T05:40:33	hzsong I'd stimulate because I think wage growth could be stronger with stimulus and might soon weaken without it
s1moncox	724472118818131968	2016-04-25T05:36:27	BaldingsWorld Fine. But it would be a bigger problem if local and central data matched perfectly.

s1moncox	724467704808103936	2016-04-25T05:18:55	peter_tl Maybe. It's important that an overhang of bad past loans doesn't inhibit good future loans. Not sure India is passing that test.

s1moncox	724447622757376000	2016-04-25T03:59:07	peter_tl It depends on which SOEs are allowed to swap debt for equity + the swap might make banks more responsible.

s1moncox	724442501126316032	2016-04-25T03:38:46	peter_tl I agree: without reform, there will be bailouts. But with bailouts, there can still be reform.
s1moncox	724428113560530945	2016-04-25T02:41:36	peter_tl Is it possible to give market forces a more decisive role in China's economy without suffering a banking crisis?
s1moncox	724427229145366528	2016-04-25T02:38:05	peter_tl Most governments bail out their banks in a crisis. So few governments give market forces a decisive role by those standards.
s1moncox	724425717413335045	2016-04-25T02:32:04	peter_tl Can an economy with $8000 GDP per head prosper with state-directed lending? If not, can it commercialise banking without a crisis?
s1moncox	724423307374645248	2016-04-25T02:22:30	peter_tl I don't think banking crises or liquidity traps improve microeconomic efficiency.

s1moncox	724410279690264576	2016-04-25T01:30:44	peter_tl So China will endure a lost decade to teach banks a lesson?

s1moncox	724069310348464128	2016-04-24T02:55:50	hzsong In principle, it requires only a rise in the level of aggregate demand, not a shift in the mix of demand (although that'd be nice)
s1moncox	723327176846667777	2016-04-22T01:46:52	On the other hand, deleveraging without keeping demand up will be really hard too. 
s1moncox	723321092664745985	2016-04-22T01:22:41	darpanbiswas Yes but then the economy would fall short of its potential and stimulus would be appropriate.
