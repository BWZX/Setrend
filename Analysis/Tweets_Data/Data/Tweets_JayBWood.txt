JayBWood	724276450577264640	2016-04-24T16:38:56	The behavior is abhorrent. I just don't get why it's news. News would be finding out HOV was 100% faithful.  
JayBWood	724270029227843584	2016-04-24T16:13:25	The flaw is you projecting a level of morality on someone you don't know. 90% odds he was chronically unfaithful 
JayBWood	724267829164384257	2016-04-24T16:04:41	Anyone that likes Jay Z less today is in dire need of a reality check. Did you really think he was faithful!?!?!? If so, that's on you

JayBWood	721040178958233600	2016-04-15T18:19:09	julianlytle kharyrandolph so it's wrong of her to accept a major role playing a cartoon depiction? Like, we all realize this isn't real?

JayBWood	714145873261780992	2016-03-27T17:43:39	Agreed, Iron Man 3 was legitimately bad. Avengers 2 wasn't very good either

JayBWood	713407529989091328	2016-03-25T16:49:44	Funny that when someone likes a film with a 67 rotten tomatoes they're not accused of being on the bandwagon
JayBWood	713406983790075905	2016-03-25T16:47:34	Sorry. I’m a huge DC fan and disliked a movie. Has nothing to do with a bandwagon.

JayBWood	712840680536731650	2016-03-24T03:17:16	Overlong, underdeveloped and almost entirely humorless

JayBWood	712776576665051137	2016-03-23T23:02:33	JayBWood ThatDaveJordan I expected a divisive movie with critics but what we got instead is shaping up to be a consensus.
JayBWood	712769749260828673	2016-03-23T22:35:25	Is that supposed to be Snyder's choice for Catwoman? Can't be worse than his choice for Luthor  
JayBWood	712769450680971264	2016-03-23T22:34:14	You really think major movie critics were clamoring to take this film? 
JayBWood	712759528002084865	2016-03-23T21:54:48	In a perverse way I'm MORE interested in seeing it now that the reviews are bludgeoning. See for myself.

JayBWood	712646897777950721	2016-03-23T14:27:15	Agreed. I've been through this debate before, and part of me thinks it's a fool's errand. But if not now, when? 
JayBWood	712642704765751298	2016-03-23T14:10:35	The ONLY way this doesn't continue is if we don't preorder the book. And a LOT of us have to follow through.
JayBWood	712642558065778688	2016-03-23T14:10:00	$6 is more than most would pay for a single movie on demand. It's almost as much as a month of Netflix. It's more than almost any ios game.

JayBWood	712632361201102848	2016-03-23T13:29:29	bobbyshortle and this whole "56 page" thing is a classic bait and switch. Condition buyers to the price, then reduce value/price
JayBWood	712614198015078401	2016-03-23T12:17:19	The 56-pages in Civil War 2 #1 does not excuse the $5.99 price. They'll go to 48 and then 40, etc...conditioning us to new price point
JayBWood	712595799906074625	2016-03-23T11:04:12	JayBWood JeremyBigmouth Once they establish a price point it becomes a game of diminishing returns. $6 gets 56 pgs, then 48, then 40, etc.

JayBWood	709569654587527168	2016-03-15T02:39:23	4 days until c2e2...I apologize in advance for buying ALL THE ART.
JayBWood	709566638060920833	2016-03-15T02:27:24	Thanks jorge_molinam for the kick-ass A-Force pages! And to GWillowWilson for writing a great series. 
JayBWood	709471854629675008	2016-03-14T20:10:46	I'm a fan of dynamic pricing generally (my investor hat, that is) so this intrigues me.  
JayBWood	709470631654531072	2016-03-14T20:05:54	Interesting...Eagles moving to a tiered pricing structure this year, charging more for "premium" games.
JayBWood	709218911133310976	2016-03-14T03:25:39	gabrielhardman thanks, it's sitting on my Regina pile right now
JayBWood	709207310854463488	2016-03-14T02:39:33	gabrielhardman spill the beans
JayBWood	709193027621883904	2016-03-14T01:42:48	I think it's bonkers that C. Correa is going in the 1st round. By all means, league mates. By all means.
JayBWood	709127611918602240	2016-03-13T21:22:52	I wish it was Image Expo like tomorrow. Never been this excited for an announcement.
JayBWood	709126880927080448	2016-03-13T21:19:58	graubart I fear I may have become excited by a fake Twitter screenshot showing both disavowing him
JayBWood	709125670316740608	2016-03-13T21:15:09	NeverWanderer that's not what he said today, but I guess the proof will be in the pudding
JayBWood	709122978060111872	2016-03-13T21:04:27	Wow...can't believe Rubio and Cruz have officially said they won't support Trump if he gets nom. Impressed (and shocked).
JayBWood	709117705161449472	2016-03-13T20:43:30	Stelfreeze it's an immense pleasure to see your artistry on one of my favorite characters.

JayBWood	709048394430484480	2016-03-13T16:08:05	Yeah we socialize a lot in my community  
JayBWood	708776582224150528	2016-03-12T22:08:00	If you'd told me that 2016 would see 5% unemployment and $2 gas, I probably wouldn't have predicted populist disruptions of both parties.
JayBWood	708874435978113024	2016-03-13T04:36:50	Trump on protesters: "I hope you arrest them, I'll file whatever charges you want." This is the scariest person in America.
JayBWood	708892281277788160	2016-03-13T05:47:45	A neighbor just cited the AMAC as his source for why Trump's imbecilic views on immigration were valid. TimeToMove
JayBWood	708883406214443010	2016-03-13T05:12:29	I would laugh at this if my Birds weren't paying Bradford $18mm per...  
JayBWood	708880330900561920	2016-03-13T05:00:15	GarryBoom was it? Good to hear, I was worried bc of the rewrites to tie it into Cloverfield
JayBWood	708878968594829313	2016-03-13T04:54:51	Wait, why are you retweeting jasonlatour Adam? My two worlds are colliding!

JayBWood	708675856399470592	2016-03-12T15:27:45	I need to get on this with the quickness then 
JayBWood	708675788187504640	2016-03-12T15:27:29	Taking this year off...heading back to c2e2 for first time in 3 years. Taking fam to Costa Rica (I think) in summer 
JayBWood	708675131107835904	2016-03-12T15:24:52	As a technology investor for 20 years, and an avid Twitter user...I spend a lot of time thinking about how I would re-ignite the platform
JayBWood	708674920973258754	2016-03-12T15:24:02	donaldjmock I have a feeling we would be great friends if we were in close proximity. Music tastes aside ;)
JayBWood	708674432584306688	2016-03-12T15:22:05	donaldjmock love the Bieber...kid can sing. Reminds me of Timberlake
JayBWood	708673093150048262	2016-03-12T15:16:46	More essential than the RSP?!?!? 
JayBWood	708671897542725632	2016-03-12T15:12:01	I'm in too good a mood to think about Trump. But let's just say that this lifelong Republican is going to be stumping for Hillary if need be
JayBWood	708671034275307520	2016-03-12T15:08:35	One of my mentors always told me that predicting the price of oil was the ultimate fool's errand.  
JayBWood	708669484786171904	2016-03-12T15:02:26	RESPECT!!!!!!!!!!

JayBWood	708668146069200896	2016-03-12T14:57:07	But...every now and then a song on the charts hits home. Loving this 7 Years joint. Right up my alley.
JayBWood	708668041303826432	2016-03-12T14:56:42	I always swore I wouldn't be that old man who doesn't like the most popular music. But I've become that guy, for the most part
JayBWood	708390474659340289	2016-03-11T20:33:45	c2e2 in six days y'all. SIX DAYS.

JayBWood	707054498091552768	2016-03-08T04:05:03	Howie Roseman has a long way to go to gain my confidence, but dumping Murray, Maxwell and Alonso for draft picks is an AWESOME first step
JayBWood	706336256783998980	2016-03-06T04:31:01	Ted Cruz is a great choice for people who are put off by Donald Trump but still want to vote for someone horrible.
JayBWood	706622153211432960	2016-03-06T23:27:04	AnnieW my pleasure

JayBWood	704873392407748608	2016-03-02T03:38:07	tomfowlerbug fair enough. I'm talking about pure aping, someone not yet finding their own style. Lacking confidence.
JayBWood	704871367301337088	2016-03-02T03:30:04	Yoooo, the final scenes of Walking Dead (two weeks ago) were straight DAFUQ!?!?!?!
JayBWood	704869867300720640	2016-03-02T03:24:06	julianlytle not when the styles are so clearly just aping other artists. Artists need to find THEIR voice.
JayBWood	704869734320381952	2016-03-02T03:23:35	julianlytle me too, fam. Me too. Cannot believe this maniac is going to get the GOP nod.
JayBWood	704869081854427136	2016-03-02T03:20:59	Young artists need to pick a style. Nothing turns me off more than seeing a gallery with images that appear to be from 20 different artists
JayBWood	704785214543962112	2016-03-01T21:47:44	For all the talk about the need for an elite quarterback, worth noting that Tom, Ben and Peyton each won a Bowl as average (at best) QBs

JayBWood	703386419557826560	2016-02-27T01:09:25	So baffled and disappointed that ChrisChristie endorsed Trump. It's an affront to those of us who take the election seriously
JayBWood	703386068662353920	2016-02-27T01:08:01	Yes, I am understandably elated of the news Domino will be in the Deadpool sequel.

JayBWood	701608915113381888	2016-02-22T03:26:15	BrettAIsrael not about going straight to the top. WWE hasn't gotten anyone over in years b/c of the booking.
JayBWood	701608045508476929	2016-02-22T03:22:47	BrettAIsrael how is that not a fair comparison!?!?!? WWE should have the best talent, best bookers. Lack of it hardly excuses criticism
JayBWood	701604716086697985	2016-02-22T03:09:34	voiceswrestling does it baffle you how quickly WWE can make AJ just another guy? So disappointed.
JayBWood	701604509487906816	2016-02-22T03:08:44	Again...WWE's fault. Whether it's the Styles Clash kick out or the 45-year old opponent or the intro or... 
JayBWood	701603935484825601	2016-02-22T03:06:28	Relative to the matches AJ has put on in New Japan over the last two years? Not extreme, at all.  
JayBWood	701603425767845889	2016-02-22T03:04:26	TheChrisSnell that's WWE's fault. He's the reigning Observer Wrestler of the Year. One of the best workers in the world.
JayBWood	701603174399000579	2016-02-22T03:03:26	thewadekeller I suspect that's because many people didn't watch him in New Japan. Vs that? This was awful.
JayBWood	701601972005289984	2016-02-22T02:58:39	How can the WWE turn the best wrestler in the world into just another WWE midcarder in two months!?!?!
