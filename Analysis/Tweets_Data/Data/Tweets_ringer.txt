ringer	726093809768091648	2016-04-29T17:00:29	Today from DavidShoemaker: How WWE finally realized there's life outside WWE 
ringer	725892625912360961	2016-04-29T03:41:03	Well, that was...something. Gonna spend the rest of the night piecing together what the hell just happened. Thanks for hanging out!
ringer	725888579126206464	2016-04-29T03:24:58	Last time Arizona "gambled" on a guy with "character issues" it ended with Tyrann Mathieu. Steve Keim just stays winning in the draft, man.
ringer	725886856894648322	2016-04-29T03:18:07	The 49ers just traded up for a guard. In other news: I'm now running the 49ers.

ringer	725884960712712192	2016-04-29T03:10:35	Travel plans are ready. 
ringer	725883761213067264	2016-04-29T03:05:49	In terms of scheme, Paxton Lynch to Denver makes a lot of sense. In Kubiak's ideal world, his quarterback moves well, and Lynch does.
ringer	725877645066432513	2016-04-29T02:41:31	Kirk Cousins now has Doctson, DeSean, Garcon, and Jordan Reed. He could punt the ball every play and complete 60 percent of his passes.
ringer	725876556007002114	2016-04-29T02:37:11	Just to recap: Myles Jack is still available, and no one has even mentioned Robert Nkemdiche tonight.
ringer	725874504124112897	2016-04-29T02:29:02	Todd Bowles is going to turn Darron Lee loose after quarterbacks, and it has a chance to be glorious.
ringer	725874006855835648	2016-04-29T02:27:03	SeanFennessey Pretty bummed that we don't get this.
ringer	725870761655689216	2016-04-29T02:14:10	If Myles Jack falls to the Packers, I'm moving to Mars.
ringer	725870520458080256	2016-04-29T02:13:12	Guessing Ryan Grigson was heartbroken when Corey Coleman went off the board, but Ryan Kelly is a decent consolation prize.
ringer	725868226777747456	2016-04-29T02:04:05	Lions' right tackle might have been the worst position in the league last year. It's nice to see they want Matt Stafford to keep living.
ringer	725864472066154496	2016-04-29T01:49:10	Pretty much everything about my fantasy of Tunsil landing on the Cowboys' line applies to the Raiders. We were so close.
ringer	725863975133421569	2016-04-29T01:47:12	Dolphins G.M. Chris Grier, looking around at his staff, confused: "Umm...OK, if no one else is going to."
ringer	725860612564099072	2016-04-29T01:33:50	Hargreaves always made sense for the Bucs. They desperately needed a corner, and Mike Smith hasn't shied way from smaller guys (Trufant).
ringer	725856067196841984	2016-04-29T01:15:46	Don't worry, I got my Leonard Floyd rationalizing out of the way last night. I'm all set. 
ringer	725855697544450048	2016-04-29T01:14:18	This is insanity. 
ringer	725854143554805760	2016-04-29T01:08:08	The Bears just traded for the pick, and I'm letting everyone know right now that I'm not responsible for what happens next.
ringer	725852948509523968	2016-04-29T01:03:23	The Titans really got Tunsil anyway. It actually happened.
ringer	725851178441920512	2016-04-29T00:56:21	Seriously, someone go check on her. 
ringer	725851089757564928	2016-04-29T00:56:00	We've now entered a world in which Laremy Tunsil is in play for my Bears at 11, and I'm starting to hyperventilate.
ringer	725847758679080960	2016-04-29T00:42:45	Forget value for a sec. Darren McFadden rushed for 1,100 yards behind the Cowboys' line last year. Without Romo. This could be silly.
ringer	725846724887990274	2016-04-29T00:38:39	Oh my god. Jerry did it.
ringer	725845904670912513	2016-04-29T00:35:23	The Chargers have money tied up in tackles through '18 and just signed another good corner. This isn't THAT crazy.

ringer	725840910139809793	2016-04-29T00:15:33	These waits are awful, but at least you guys get TV. At the draft, we get "Bust a Move" on the PA and Michael Irvin as hype man.

ringer	725746514199498752	2016-04-28T18:00:27	Baalke spent a few drafts taking every injured player, now Jaylon Smith is available and badly injured. Sign him up! 
ringer	725746154491809792	2016-04-28T17:59:01	Two moves already made: The Rams and Eagles trading up for QBs I would characterize as "completely fine."  
ringer	725745695597146112	2016-04-28T17:57:12	Over. Someone will get desperate and trade back into first to grab Lynch. It'll be a huge mistake but it will be fun 
ringer	725745046629277696	2016-04-28T17:54:37	They trade an absolute haul for Lynch, who then loses a QB competition to Geno Smith.  
ringer	725744438379687936	2016-04-28T17:52:12	Good question. Buckner is slightly bigger but less explosion. Gonna go Bosa if he's willing to jump off cell (he is) 
ringer	725743933502951425	2016-04-28T17:50:12	To a smart team that figures out 4-5 years of Jack is better than  decade of another LB you can get in bottom 1st. 
ringer	725743387001892864	2016-04-28T17:48:01	Someone like safety Sean Davis. But BillSimmons' idea of using a pick to rip Goodell at podium should be on table. 
ringer	725742977973424129	2016-04-28T17:46:24	Depends: How many slow linebackers from big schools are available? 
ringer	725742638046044160	2016-04-28T17:45:03	I would take Ramsey and figure out the rest. Those guys who can play anywhere on field are the key to modern NFL D. 
ringer	725742041876058112	2016-04-28T17:42:41	If history is any indication: Someone they don't need. (But for their sake, maybe Shaq Lawson.) 
ringer	725741836803919872	2016-04-28T17:41:52	Don’t think so. Treadwell has speed questions. Doctson is great, but I don't think any team will panic and overdraft 
ringer	725741234850004992	2016-04-28T17:39:28	They could be contenders with pass rush (Bosa) or DB help (Ramsey). Elliott, of course, is flashy. So he'd take him. 
ringer	725740754904166400	2016-04-28T17:37:34	Top 2 QBs are getting overdrafted. I could see a run on DBs and someone average like M. Alexander going in late 1. 
ringer	725740406122647553	2016-04-28T17:36:11	If Browns keep trading down over and over and eventually collect the draft's last 200 picks, yes, they will all bust 
ringer	725740035476197376	2016-04-28T17:34:42	Goff: Cheese. Totally fine.  Wentz: Leftover pepperoni. High ceiling but definite risks Lynch: anchovies, because no
