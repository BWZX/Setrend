jpwwhite123	686423954320326658	2016-01-11T05:46:38	MichalakisCon it can create assets for that without selling reserves? the debts are RMB denominated. I think weak CNY is CA opening related
jpwwhite123	686406431419940864	2016-01-11T04:37:00	JeffCNYC China's 20% of global trade but 3% of global assets (B of England). The adjustment is RMB negative. CN's working against the -ve.
jpwwhite123	686405777930620932	2016-01-11T04:34:24	JeffCNYC I see it this way. China is allowing reserves to shift from the public BS (reserves) to the private BS (global equities/RE).
jpwwhite123	686402020643749888	2016-01-11T04:19:29	JeffCNYC agree. It's interesting how poorly bonds have performed in this environment. But 15% lower CNY does nothing for industrial growth.
jpwwhite123	686397966609809408	2016-01-11T04:03:22	If China were to run out of reserves; where would the currency be? On December's run rate; 7.6 to the US$ in June-18. 16% lower.

jpwwhite123	686292905829388288	2016-01-10T21:05:54	RobertCandelori in particular services are measured very badly meaning growth is under-measured. More GDP would lead to higher productivity
jpwwhite123	686292551582666752	2016-01-10T21:04:29	RobertCandelori me: innovation changes the shape of an economy. Statistics don't pick this up. Tech has changed the economy's shape
jpwwhite123	686291146083979264	2016-01-10T20:58:54	RobertCandelori I'd argue the opposite but it's hard to win because the positives from innovation don't show up in the statistics.
