owenthomas	699259503871590400	2016-02-15T15:50:31	karangoel robinwauters The EMC/VMware structure remains uncommon. Complete split like eBay/PayPal or HPE/Hewlett-Packard is more common.
owenthomas	699259118301753344	2016-02-15T15:49:00	karangoel robinwauters You might have a segment report independently as a prelude to a partial spinoff or issuance of tracking stock.
owenthomas	699258831906279424	2016-02-15T15:47:51	karangoel robinwauters Nope nope. Independently reporting segment is not the same thing as separately trading stock. That's the error.
owenthomas	699258377302515713	2016-02-15T15:46:03	karangoel robinwauters Best analogy is how EMC bought VMware in 2003 and spun out a minority stake in 2007, keeping 80% of company
owenthomas	699257639704768513	2016-02-15T15:43:07	karangoel robinwauters So say that Alphabet bought everything but Dorsey's and other employees' stakes, leaving it publicly traded

owenthomas	699255758563577856	2016-02-15T15:35:39	robinwauters karangoel So I guess Alphabet would acquire a controlling stake but leave TWTR publicly traded? Otherwise makes no sense.
