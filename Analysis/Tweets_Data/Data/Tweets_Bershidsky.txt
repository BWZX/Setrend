Bershidsky	709730136954904576	2016-03-15T13:17:05	DDERSS tggrove Because it's not a real withdrawal and because the air force can return within days. It's an empty gesture.
Bershidsky	709729596661374977	2016-03-15T13:14:56	DDERSS tggrove Since a "partial" withdrawal is not really a withdrawal, no announcement needed to be made. It's a ploy

Bershidsky	694155898172772353	2016-02-01T13:50:37	MisterSplashy skrodolies So what would disclosure change now, except reveal the model as non-viable without huge cash infusions?
