LorenAdler	701142443710873601	2016-02-20T20:32:39	gloryhole_abyss The general economic consensus is the people would simply hold capital longer before realizing, reducing revenue.
LorenAdler	701134549535707136	2016-02-20T20:01:17	gloryhole_abyss That's from JCT models. ~30 percent is actually the revenue-maximizing rate by their estimates: 
LorenAdler	701131177160261633	2016-02-20T19:47:53	sonimfan That's my analysis (former job) and is all simple CBO estimates. Still raises a ton, just not enough to pay for new spending.

LorenAdler	701101989313302528	2016-02-20T17:51:54	robprather Oh yes, but the dynamics done so far have been very modest. E.g., huge Camp tax overhaul only raised an add'l ~$200B dynamically
LorenAdler	701101212674998272	2016-02-20T17:48:49	sonimfan So his proposed taxes don't raise as much as claimed:  (But his econ impact ests are the "fantasy math")

LorenAdler	701092634077474816	2016-02-20T17:14:44	MattVallone Generally they outline how to "achieve" the savings, though it's through very unrealistic means like aggressive block granting.
LorenAdler	701092506977456129	2016-02-20T17:14:13	MattVallone Tough to judge on that side since a budget isn't technically supposed to do more than give committees topline numbers, but ...

LorenAdler	694947705177694208	2016-02-03T18:16:59	Real_JMOOB That's cause all the "ifs" in this analysis operate in the opposite direction, so our estimate serves as a good upper bound.
LorenAdler	694945376642670592	2016-02-03T18:07:43	Real_JMOOB The taxes Sanders explicitly proposes are straightforward to score. That's what we show, just like we do for GOP tax plans.
LorenAdler	694944305291616256	2016-02-03T18:03:28	Real_JMOOB Are you just saying you support something that's actually closer to Medicare for all rather than Bernie's proposal?
LorenAdler	694944174794280964	2016-02-03T18:02:57	Real_JMOOB Well yes, but they wouldn't be able to do any of this under many iterations of single-payer.
LorenAdler	694943358033199104	2016-02-03T17:59:42	Real_JMOOB Yes, but are you saying they have a proposal? Their main proposal I've seen is an ACO-like reform to Medicare.
LorenAdler	694940367280586752	2016-02-03T17:47:49	Real_JMOOB Do you have a link to details on it? Would be curious to read.
LorenAdler	694940033472716800	2016-02-03T17:46:29	Real_JMOOB Curious separate from this analysis. Have you seen public proposals for a pay-for-performance single-payer plan in US?
LorenAdler	694937838622785536	2016-02-03T17:37:46	Real_JMOOB What makes you say Bernie's single-payer plan would have a pay-for-performance component? It sounds like FFS from his documents.
LorenAdler	694936792466849792	2016-02-03T17:33:37	Real_JMOOB Huh? We didn't include any economic effects in the score. This is meant to be a high-end CBO/JCT static score.
LorenAdler	694933638832611330	2016-02-03T17:21:05	YeaYouRite Making sure the ACA stays law is a pretty huge step in that direction.
LorenAdler	694933223189659648	2016-02-03T17:19:26	Real_JMOOB Universal health care is a very reasonable goal. Our analysis is simply math.
LorenAdler	694932820133810176	2016-02-03T17:17:50	Real_JMOOB The impacts of single-payer would just be a stronger version's of the ACA's in this case. Doesn't make it a bad policy.
LorenAdler	694931570201903104	2016-02-03T17:12:52	Real_JMOOB Or the mainstream economic consensus: 
LorenAdler	694931310024986624	2016-02-03T17:11:50	Real_JMOOB Yes, an analysis that purports magically astronomical savings from single-payer, incl nearly eliminating all drug spending.
LorenAdler	694930835359801344	2016-02-03T17:09:56	Impt to note: Even our estimates are overly optimistic on his plan's revenue by not accounting for dynamic impacts. 
LorenAdler	694930443662139392	2016-02-03T17:08:23	Real_JMOOB Huh? Even Sanders says his plan would cost the fed govt $14 trillion, but doesn't propose enough taxes to pay for that.
LorenAdler	694930135573778432	2016-02-03T17:07:10	Real_JMOOB Though there's also debate over that first question since some more ppl would stay out of labor force if free h'care was avail.
LorenAdler	694929991390359553	2016-02-03T17:06:35	Real_JMOOB The real economic drag is from huge tax rate increases, above even their revenue-maximizing levels (according to Diamond/Saez).
LorenAdler	694929590528167936	2016-02-03T17:05:00	Real_JMOOB His tax offsets simply don't raise as much as claimed. It's early in campaign, so plenty of time to propose add'l pay-fors.
LorenAdler	694929270771212288	2016-02-03T17:03:43	Real_JMOOB Our analysis is purely of his proposed taxes. The $3T hole takes Sanders' estimates of the plan's costs at face value.
LorenAdler	694928681920237568	2016-02-03T17:01:23	Real_JMOOB In what way? They are very close to what JCT/CBO would say, which is the point of the estimates.
LorenAdler	694927498493165571	2016-02-03T16:56:41	Real_JMOOB Our estimates are actually still overly optimistic, don't account for declining marginal rev from rate ↑ or the huge econ drag.
LorenAdler	694924557325574144	2016-02-03T16:45:00	delmoi RedwoodGirl We support fiscally-responsible proposals. We've also consistently attacked the GOP tax cuts:

LorenAdler	694918297133850624	2016-02-03T16:20:07	And here's why his numbers don't add up, even under extremely generous assumptions:

LorenAdler	694907158740205570	2016-02-03T15:35:52	MrQuindazzi RedwoodGirl Bipartisan, actually. And the analysis is just simply arithmetic based on neutral scorekeeper CBO's estimates.
LorenAdler	694903832090931201	2016-02-03T15:22:38	fleetadmiralj gus_802 Sorry, the title of that line in the table isn't great. It's because he's replacing the AMT, PEP, and PEASE.
LorenAdler	694900636861775872	2016-02-03T15:09:57	And these estimates are before accounting for dynamic effects that would inevitably increase the discrepancy.

LorenAdler	692757586349834242	2016-01-28T17:14:14	weinerja julial_mitchell Now that it's deductible, it's nearly equivalent to a cap on the exclusion (rather than more onerous).

LorenAdler	692129534720741376	2016-01-26T23:38:34	E__Strobel Oh yes, the phrasing is odd. The drug manufacturer has to pay a % of the drug's cost back to plan/government.

LorenAdler	692111727350157312	2016-01-26T22:27:49	PolicyRx I've actually seen such a score, presumably because lawmakers are reluctant to go out on such a limb.

LorenAdler	692099541332561921	2016-01-26T21:39:23	Although, as afrakt reports on recently, simply making a ruckus about drug prices can help subdue them a little:
