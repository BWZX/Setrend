t0nyyates	726078990155452417	2016-04-29T16:01:35	asentance D_Blanchflower yes but wd normally think structural moves at low frequencies

t0nyyates	726068598058418177	2016-04-29T15:20:18	asentance D_Blanchflower well, falling or not it's still &gt; natural rate, and growing or not, output gap&lt;0, hence weak inflation.

t0nyyates	726062752289148929	2016-04-29T14:57:04	asentance D_Blanchflower see, for example, Eggertson/Krugman QJE.
t0nyyates	726062566703816709	2016-04-29T14:56:20	asentance D_Blanchflower mild deflation, since it increases real value of nominal debts, reducing demand further, v bad, esp close to zlb.
t0nyyates	726062129485328384	2016-04-29T14:54:35	asentance D_Blanchflower structural problems are no worse than before the crisis;  increase in u/e since then is demand induced.

t0nyyates	725983776938037249	2016-04-29T09:43:15	ryanavent :) as fellow N.S., i just take the spread of these bad model estimates as routine, and vote accordingly.
t0nyyates	725983383373926401	2016-04-29T09:41:41	ryanavent now, no room.  and fiscal policy hands tied behind back.  the depreciation would be 'real', not 'monetary'.
t0nyyates	725983175462273029	2016-04-29T09:40:51	ryanavent in the past, rates were far above the zero bound, and could engineer a monetary depreciation to curtail effects of a recession.
t0nyyates	725982944230297600	2016-04-29T09:39:56	ryanavent here - as with most sudden stops - it would be the big demand shock causing a slump and the depreciation [potentially]
t0nyyates	725982608966950912	2016-04-29T09:38:36	ryanavent it is massive.  i don't know what the effects of those past calamities/successes was, though.  it's hard to tell, isn't it?
t0nyyates	725982352820854784	2016-04-29T09:37:35	ryanavent true, but the empirical estimates of openness on trade are what they are.  and it may be non-tariff factors that r most important
t0nyyates	725980470643675141	2016-04-29T09:30:06	.ryanavent 13/ there's considerable spread estimates of both legs.  But why is either 'wildly implasible'? [Ending reply on no 13].
t0nyyates	725980076731420672	2016-04-29T09:28:33	.ryanavent 12/ leg 1 is the link between trade and openness, leg 2 is the link between trade and GDP/head.
t0nyyates	725979678893326336	2016-04-29T09:26:58	.ryanavent 11/ To mount a telling attack on the economics, you need to interrogate the two key legs of the calculations...
t0nyyates	725979059709181952	2016-04-29T09:24:30	.ryanavent 10/ + there could be countless further event risks as key decisions are made.
t0nyyates	725978771539513344	2016-04-29T09:23:21	.ryanavent 9/ Plausible that those costs could weigh as heavily as the central 'certainty' estimates so far published IMO.
t0nyyates	725978614701916161	2016-04-29T09:22:44	.ryanavent 8/ NB Brexit estimates miss out uncertainty costs of not knowing precisely which scenario UK will end up on.
t0nyyates	725978377895694336	2016-04-29T09:21:47	.ryanavent 7/ Not clear how BoE 'doing its job properly' would change much.  Rates are near ZLB;  QE of dubious value now.
t0nyyates	725978171062018048	2016-04-29T09:20:58	.ryanavent 6/ what we may be talking about is a sudden stop.  ie fall in confidence, demand, capital outflow.  This cd be a disaster.
t0nyyates	725977878815473664	2016-04-29T09:19:48	.ryanavent 5/I think you are incredibly sanguine about the post Brexit shock, pointing only to the beneficial effects of lower Â£.
t0nyyates	725977624716152832	2016-04-29T09:18:48	.ryanavent 4/ the estimates are only 'spuriously precise' if you take them to be precise. They are central estimates, with distributions.
t0nyyates	725977400245407744	2016-04-29T09:17:54	.ryanavent 3/ don't at all get your argument that 'flexibility' [something common to in and out scenarios] mitigates costs of out scenarios
t0nyyates	725977122842546176	2016-04-29T09:16:48	.ryanavent u think 10% wildly implausible, but which bit of the calculation used to get there is implausible? Evidence for an alternative?
t0nyyates	725976836635787264	2016-04-29T09:15:40	.ryanavent 1/ lots to agree with in your column, but not the economics.  You don't raise any specific objection to the models.

t0nyyates	715568419580551168	2016-03-31T15:56:20	M_C_Klein 4.  oscar's idea is to shortcut that and regress y_t on the shock_t-10 directly, or similar;  and same for other horizons.
t0nyyates	715568109143334912	2016-03-31T15:55:06	M_C_Klein 3.  but doing this makes the effect of shock 10 periods out a function of rho^10.  Mis-estimations of rho get amplified greatly.
t0nyyates	715567741835616260	2016-03-31T15:53:38	M_C_Klein 2.  that's y_t=rho*y_t-1+shock_t.  then to project out the effect of the shock for 10 periods by repeatedly substituting in.

t0nyyates	712667667430313985	2016-03-23T15:49:47	dandolfa yes, I agree, you can, for inflation targeting, just do it, as Ben Mc said.  So I am going out on a limb.  I accept that.
t0nyyates	712667470981632001	2016-03-23T15:49:00	ndls61 georgeeaton a price which you might well feel wd be worth it.  Â£ not being everything and all that.
t0nyyates	712667179586551808	2016-03-23T15:47:50	ndls61 georgeeaton in fact, to reiterate, the pt is to say 'this cd not continue', and to express the price you'd pay for indy.
t0nyyates	712667010417745920	2016-03-23T15:47:10	ndls61 georgeeaton the 9.4 is not a prediction, that's data, where we start now.  no-one is saying spending/taxes wd continue.
t0nyyates	712666827780960256	2016-03-23T15:46:27	dandolfa it can be, i concede.  it's also potentially cheap.  but that applies to the inflation target too, initially.
t0nyyates	712666657618075648	2016-03-23T15:45:46	ndls61 georgeeaton sure, wd not question those who put value on indy for its own political sake, but the numbers tell you the price.
t0nyyates	712666413379530752	2016-03-23T15:44:48	dandolfa well, you aren't promising a path;  you're saying what your target promise implies for your instrument
t0nyyates	712666127214751744	2016-03-23T15:43:40	dandolfa and, if you'd bowed to time-consistency fatalism, you might not have built that reputation.
t0nyyates	712665853653819392	2016-03-23T15:42:34	dandolfa i was saying, in a flippant way, that you had to start somewhere with those promises.  so, likewise, you can sart now with this.

t0nyyates	712665272495259648	2016-03-23T15:40:16	ndls61 georgeeaton well, in absence of a date, we r using the IFS to say this is what it wd be like now, and for the next x years.
t0nyyates	712664535539310592	2016-03-23T15:37:20	ndls61 georgeeaton certainly, you wd not have anything like what was in that white paper.
t0nyyates	712664404697997313	2016-03-23T15:36:49	ndls61 georgeeaton not sure my tweet got through;  pt is wd you have much higher taxes, much lower spending, or some combination?
t0nyyates	712663328519299073	2016-03-23T15:32:32	ndls61 georgeeaton and that isn't the end of it, as there'd be a scottish risk premium to deal with, nastily related to that gap.
t0nyyates	712663165197230081	2016-03-23T15:31:53	ndls61 georgeeaton A:1.roughly same debt/GDP;2. Pt is to show what you'd have to do to taxes/spending to close this gap.

t0nyyates	712661489266589696	2016-03-23T15:25:14	EdConwaySky remember this is a lower bound;  excludes scottish indy risk premium, which cd have been quite large.
t0nyyates	712658776659202048	2016-03-23T15:14:27	dandolfa yes, but suppose Paul V had listened to your clever lift pitch 'why bother with this 'low and stable inflation' crap?!'
t0nyyates	712658305622151168	2016-03-23T15:12:35	dandolfa you're just saying that.
t0nyyates	712658231697481728	2016-03-23T15:12:17	dandolfa yes, ok.  don't beat me up with that.
t0nyyates	712658037773844480	2016-03-23T15:11:31	dandolfa well fair point.  but why bother saying 'inflation target'.  in fact, why bother at all.  ok, off to slit my throat.
t0nyyates	712657433454362624	2016-03-23T15:09:07	dandolfa well, supposing their are limits to QE, and you buy, roughly, some version of the NK model....
t0nyyates	712657219905581056	2016-03-23T15:08:16	dandolfa rather than 'oh sh1t, can't move R now.  let's try to blag about long rate and hope they buy it!'
t0nyyates	712657078641369088	2016-03-23T15:07:42	dandolfa and, in vicinity of the zero bound, you need to shift long rates around.  you'll do that more credibly if you have built faith b4
t0nyyates	712656656979640320	2016-03-23T15:06:02	dandolfa well, you also have what you figure out privately you are going to need to do.  so tell us what that is.  maybe we can help.
t0nyyates	712656218360266761	2016-03-23T15:04:17	dandolfa saying 'trust me, we'll do what it takes' isn't enough.  i want to know about the mad toys you play with to figure out what to do.

t0nyyates	712655713978478592	2016-03-23T15:02:17	dandolfa true, but, they help us figure out what state contingent policy is, in conjunction with other necessarily imprecise information

t0nyyates	712654595927982080	2016-03-23T14:57:50	dandolfa well, low and stable inflation, in choppy seas, might mean f!cking wildly girating interest rates, which wd be a fact of note.

t0nyyates	712653095902322689	2016-03-23T14:51:53	georgeeaton has to be considered a lower bound, since effects of a Scottish risk premium on debt service could have been quite large.
t0nyyates	712652506707394561	2016-03-23T14:49:32	sjwrenlewis that is a fair point, since skewed towards ex BoE who have been similarly indoctrinated.

t0nyyates	710190191886077952	2016-03-16T19:45:11	D_Blanchflower andrewtlevin what i don't believe in most of all is people voting for their regions interests.
t0nyyates	710190062818992128	2016-03-16T19:44:40	D_Blanchflower andrewtlevin I guess the regional Fed thing is an anachronistic states' [with banks] rights thing.
t0nyyates	710189867611856898	2016-03-16T19:43:53	D_Blanchflower andrewtlevin i'm just saying that the bank thing isn't a factor now.  starting from scratch, sure, have national MPC.
t0nyyates	710188385915310080	2016-03-16T19:38:00	D_Blanchflower andrewtlevin true that.
t0nyyates	710187667879813120	2016-03-16T19:35:09	D_Blanchflower andrewtlevin plus, don't think there's such a wedge between bank and Fed interests here.
t0nyyates	710187538770759680	2016-03-16T19:34:38	D_Blanchflower andrewtlevin always going to get a spread of opinion.  even on uk mpc that is/was true.
t0nyyates	710187397078773760	2016-03-16T19:34:04	D_Blanchflower andrewtlevin highly unlikely George voting 'for' banks.  Too many others to keep quiet and compliant in the conspiracy.
t0nyyates	710187141914038272	2016-03-16T19:33:03	D_Blanchflower ...all that audit the Fed nonsense, GOP nominee stuff on gold standard, last thing we need is congress appointing.
t0nyyates	710186995692265472	2016-03-16T19:32:29	D_Blanchflower though indirect route less good than direct route.  Pragmatically, at the moment, with GOP nuttiness on monetary policy...
t0nyyates	710186836262518786	2016-03-16T19:31:51	D_Blanchflower not directly, but, via Fed Chair, who is, and wd have a controlling say.
t0nyyates	710186517289902080	2016-03-16T19:30:35	D_Blanchflower andrewtlevin agree that it doesn't look good.  But the regional Fed boards wd not go against board of govs itself IMO.
t0nyyates	710185931224059904	2016-03-16T19:28:15	D_Blanchflower I don't think the bank thing makes any difference given FRB oversight.  Not much different from MPC.

t0nyyates	702091468236791808	2016-02-23T11:23:44	This consideration, stimulation per unit of fiscal risk taken, cd easily mean sectoral skews.  [eg towards banks, or small corp issuers].
t0nyyates	702091211700617216	2016-02-23T11:22:43	But also - that purchases wd be aimed where financial frictions were hitting hardest, ie 'bang for buck'.
t0nyyates	702090959732023296	2016-02-23T11:21:43	On Carney's point as to whether non-gilt purchases shd be neutral by sector.  Two considerations.  The one he gave - avoiding 'favouritism'.
t0nyyates	702089772177694720	2016-02-23T11:17:00	However, like many things, much eaiser to imagine than to do!
t0nyyates	702089649217531904	2016-02-23T11:16:31	In principle, one cd imagine separating out 'bank profit' and monetary policies.  MPC cut with abandon, HMT/BoE compensate banks.

t0nyyates	702086122164383744	2016-02-23T11:02:30	On risk mgt grounds, therefore, safer to have looser fiscal, so that interest rates can be raised higher about the 0-ish bound.
t0nyyates	702085715983736832	2016-02-23T11:00:53	Because -eg as Jan V said in his Q&amp;A at the LSE - likelihood is that QE and similar are not perfect substitutes for interest rate policy.
t0nyyates	702085478057713664	2016-02-23T10:59:56	Carney rightly sidesteps Rees Mogg's q on fiscal policy, but answer lurking is that fiscal policy wd ideally be more stimulative...
t0nyyates	702083071076646912	2016-02-23T10:50:22	Jan Vlieghe gives textbook 'source of the shock' account of why fall in Â£ isn't necessarily net stimulative.  Quite right.
t0nyyates	702082322967961600	2016-02-23T10:47:24	That view was grounded in the [IMO incorrect] idea that what was important was expansion of reserves, not the assets bought.
t0nyyates	702081986035318784	2016-02-23T10:46:04	What's interesting is that it's an 'MPC view'.  That's as it shd be IMO, not, as it was when QE instigated, a BoE exec decision.
t0nyyates	702081757189955585	2016-02-23T10:45:09	Shafiq makes interesting comment about gilt rollover, that MPC view is to replace gilts with gilts, not with other assets.
t0nyyates	702081510761963520	2016-02-23T10:44:10	But that leaves me guessing we would not up at the upper end of the 7-22% range absent IOR.
t0nyyates	702081123220852736	2016-02-23T10:42:38	However, climate of increased uncertainty wd lead to somewhat greater precautionary demand for given rate.  And rates will be low.
t0nyyates	702080687302713344	2016-02-23T10:40:54	In long run, we'd expect QE to unwind completely.  So that takes us back to 7% of GDP.  At that pt no reason for IOR other than fine tuning.
t0nyyates	702080337816453120	2016-02-23T10:39:31	Remember real reason for IORs is to allow QE purchases without pushing market rates below &gt;0 floor.
t0nyyates	702080032840224770	2016-02-23T10:38:18	Minouche Shafiq put on the spot somewhat.  Tricky to forecast long run size.
