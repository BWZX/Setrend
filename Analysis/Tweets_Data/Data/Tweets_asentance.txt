asentance	726079323178975232	2016-04-29T16:02:55	t0nyyates D_Blanchflower Exactly - French, Spanish and Italian unemployment has been high for many years.

asentance	726062918639427584	2016-04-29T14:57:44	D_Blanchflower There's a long literature on Euro structural unemployment. Sub-zero inflation driven by weak energy/food prices helps growth
asentance	726057330845048833	2016-04-29T14:35:31	D_Blanchflower t0nyyates Euro area unemp high because of economies with structural problems, but it's coming down, Mild deflation is good.

asentance	684829280384237568	2016-01-06T20:09:58	MarkGregoryEY Consumer always largest growth contributor, with 60%+ GDP! But investment+exports still contributing more in this recovery.
asentance	684825256377331712	2016-01-06T19:53:59	MarkGregoryEY Not so. Recovery still export/investment led. Since end-2012, Inv +5.5% pa; Exp + 3.7%; Consumers +2.5%; Gov't/other +1.1%.

asentance	684757391699767298	2016-01-06T15:24:19	UK recoveries normally consumer-led but different this time. Investment &amp; exports have contributed most to growth.
