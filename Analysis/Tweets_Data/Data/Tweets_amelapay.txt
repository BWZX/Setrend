amelapay	684032948451033091	2016-01-04T15:25:38	shaneferro oops. my friend gave mother at Costco a $10 bill to buy her kid cash-only pizza slice, she then bought whole pie!!
amelapay	684032629679722496	2016-01-04T15:24:22	shaneferro because they're only impacting people who have credibly committed to pay by ordering already
amelapay	684032516114780160	2016-01-04T15:23:55	shaneferro we agree do-gooders should buy giftcards to distribute instead. otherwise, no one who wouldn't otherwise get that sbucks does

amelapay	684032250246225920	2016-01-04T15:22:51	zwinst my mom only drinks small plain coffees so hers was like &lt; $2, she could have paid well over $5 depending on what next person ordered
amelapay	684032089101086720	2016-01-04T15:22:13	zwinst I guess that's why it happens at the drive through and not inside. inside, you'd have to just guess and give cashier $5 or something
amelapay	684031856250122240	2016-01-04T15:21:17	zwinst because they've taken the order already, it's being made, so the sbucks person can just tell them
amelapay	684031607829823488	2016-01-04T15:20:18	zwinst then the next person pulls up, is told they owe nothing, and often opts to do it again.
amelapay	684031439902486528	2016-01-04T15:19:38	zwinst it's usually in the drive through, and starts when someone pays for her own order and asks to pay for the one behind her too

amelapay	683357518618324993	2016-01-02T18:41:43	JAMyerson a zillion years ago you asked me what I think about Georgism and I still don't know what I think. what should I read?
amelapay	683349085798043648	2016-01-02T18:08:12	joonian maybe, except by neoliberals who don't like it for whatever reason and have tried to foist it onto libertarians
amelapay	683348597920952324	2016-01-02T18:06:16	JAMyerson for those not viscerally repulsed by assuming tax structure endogenous to business environment, they seem straight up capitalist
amelapay	683348310560759808	2016-01-02T18:05:07	JAMyerson will avoid if at all possible, but roll over if not and treat it as a cost of doing business instead of an extreme injustice
amelapay	683348196303704066	2016-01-02T18:04:40	JAMyerson IME libertarians' resistance to understanding valley technologists as libertarians is because they are pretty tax deferent
