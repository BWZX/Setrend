NickBaumann	722622984490496000	2016-04-20T03:08:39	My neighborhood is tied!

NickBaumann	722625596224839680	2016-04-20T03:19:02	When will Billy Corgan be a guest on Coast to Coast
NickBaumann	722625732271149056	2016-04-20T03:19:34	UPDATED POPULAR VOTE:  Clinton: 10,291,726 Sanders: 7,641,551
NickBaumann	722625725141016576	2016-04-20T03:19:33	No he retired in 2009 and was never heard from again. 
NickBaumann	722625489022644224	2016-04-20T03:18:36	Look at it this way, if EVERYONE voted for Bernie, it wouldn't be nearly as cool
NickBaumann	722423962236493825	2016-04-19T13:57:49	comments that aren't from trolls, just people who have no idea what The Toast is ABOUT, will never stop being funny 
NickBaumann	722625297758162944	2016-04-20T03:17:51	(They started walking it back within the hour.) 
NickBaumann	722624882975055872	2016-04-20T03:16:12	ryanlcooper But that's a high order.
NickBaumann	722624840063184897	2016-04-20T03:16:02	ryanlcooper I think we could moderate it if someone could figure out how to make voters less afraid of terrorism.
NickBaumann	722624422813765632	2016-04-20T03:14:22	ryanlcooper but seriously this seems like a complex problem to solve.
NickBaumann	722624314470699009	2016-04-20T03:13:56	ryanlcooper Trump 2016, then?
NickBaumann	722623854435311616	2016-04-20T03:12:07	.taddevine to me post-NY: "Next week is a big week. We'll see how we do there &amp; then we'll be able to sit back &amp; assess where we are."
NickBaumann	722623830129291264	2016-04-20T03:12:01	ryanlcooper I think we agree on the correct policy here but what's the change that would fix the political behavior?
NickBaumann	722623602521202688	2016-04-20T03:11:07	So, one top Sanders official is saying they'll assess where they are after next week; another one is saying they're going to the convention.
NickBaumann	722623383859384321	2016-04-20T03:10:15	This is the type of thing that makes voters cynical. 
NickBaumann	722623193547194369	2016-04-20T03:09:29	Keep handy  1920 Cox 34.1% 1936 Landon 36.5% 1992 Bush 37.4% 1972 McGovern 37.5% 1964 Goldwater 38.4% 1984 Mondale 40.6% 1928 Smith 40.8%
NickBaumann	722622956623437825	2016-04-20T03:08:33	For a winner, Clinton sure seems to be reading out of a...  (‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢) / ( ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢)&gt;‚åê‚ñ†-‚ñ† / (‚åê‚ñ†_‚ñ†)   Silver Linings Playbook.  
NickBaumann	722622897941037056	2016-04-20T03:08:19	(She lost this argument.) 
NickBaumann	722622616855568384	2016-04-20T03:07:12	John Kasich will not be the Republican nominee, though. 
NickBaumann	722622186188619776	2016-04-20T03:05:29	NickBaumann Pretty much our takes!  
NickBaumann	722622153758273536	2016-04-20T03:05:21	HuffPollster Poll Averages VS actual votes for NY: Clinton 55 | 57 Sanders 42 | 43 Undecided 4   Pretty dead on.
NickBaumann	722621810693521408	2016-04-20T03:03:59	The important thing to remember is whoever wins is lying to you now and will lie to you a lot in office.
NickBaumann	717768687332163584	2016-04-06T17:39:25	My guess: Trump will get &lt;44% in NY and not reach expectations.
NickBaumann	722621493943869440	2016-04-20T03:02:44	Look, a population map! 
NickBaumann	722621244676255744	2016-04-20T03:01:45	You mean where the people live? 
NickBaumann	722620763107418113	2016-04-20T02:59:50	The last thing Democrats want is a contested convention mess like Republicans.
NickBaumann	722621098634977280	2016-04-20T03:01:10	What are the odds that Bernie surrogates are walking back Weaver's comments tomorrow?
NickBaumann	722620992779132928	2016-04-20T03:00:44	Taniel i trust you and impossible is too strong
NickBaumann	722620826093117441	2016-04-20T03:00:05	Yeah there was a problem with the composition of congress, I can't recall exactly what the issue was... 
NickBaumann	722620592067883008	2016-04-20T02:59:09	Taniel IN seems impossible.

NickBaumann	722620041724882949	2016-04-20T02:56:58	It‚Äôs important that Fox News receive full, enduring, and indelible credit for making Donald Trump the 2016 Republican nominee
NickBaumann	722620014675800065	2016-04-20T02:56:51	Some political consultants sure are making a lot of money off of Bernie Sanders' donors right now though.
NickBaumann	722619720357294080	2016-04-20T02:55:41	Prediction: Sanders and Obama will give great speeches endorsing Clinton in Philly in July. GOP Convention will be utter clusterfuck.
NickBaumann	722619178398703616	2016-04-20T02:53:32	Whether you support Bernie or Hillary let's all come together and agree that what Billy Corrgan said was fucking nuts.
NickBaumann	722619060114956289	2016-04-20T02:53:04	Trump still *eight votes* over the threshold for all three delegates in the 13th district.

NickBaumann	722618943806971904	2016-04-20T02:52:36	Prediction: They won't actually do this and it won't work if they do. 
NickBaumann	722618399243780097	2016-04-20T02:50:26	that's an interesting take 
NickBaumann	722618269354565633	2016-04-20T02:49:55	It's amazing the reactions that simple statements of fact about guns, abortion, or Israel provoke. 
NickBaumann	722617789291356160	2016-04-20T02:48:01	Trump‚Äôs likely NY haul lowers his percentage needed in the remaining states. But he still needs ~63.5% of the remaining bound delegates.
NickBaumann	722607586374197248	2016-04-20T02:07:28	It is now mathematically impossible for Ted Cruz to clinch the GOP nomination before the convention using only bound delegates.
NickBaumann	722617503415934977	2016-04-20T02:46:53	Great headline. 
NickBaumann	722617154407952384	2016-04-20T02:45:29	Remroum So no change from current policy, then.
NickBaumann	722616867844657153	2016-04-20T02:44:21	CT primary is next week. That's the state where 20 kids were murdered + then the president tried to change gun laws + Congress stopped him.

NickBaumann	722613351357026304	2016-04-20T02:30:23	Hillary Clinton devotes a portion of her speech to explicitly standing up for Muslims and Muslim Americans.
NickBaumann	722612708739256322	2016-04-20T02:27:49	Clinton quotes best line from husband's inaugural: "There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America."
NickBaumann	722612375610880000	2016-04-20T02:26:30	I still stand by this as the correct market play. 
NickBaumann	722608512816193536	2016-04-20T02:11:09	John Kasich's strategy is LOOK A BLIMP! DID YOU SEE THAT BLIMP IT WAS SO, SO...BLIMPLIKE. Wow. What a blimp.

NickBaumann	722607336003645440	2016-04-20T02:06:28	I'm not 1000% sure, but impossible to separate from fact that she really doesn't seem to want it. 
NickBaumann	722607310535860226	2016-04-20T02:06:22	Good point. 
NickBaumann	722607112438837248	2016-04-20T02:05:35	Pretty clear Elizabeth Warren could've been the Democratic presidential nominee, no?
