arindube	714278576531578880	2016-03-28T02:30:57	JWMason1 rortybomb It's quite surprising to me that your notion of benefits ignores the fact cost of living higher in high wage areas.

arindube	714276386672873476	2016-03-28T02:22:15	JWMason1 ModeledBehavior I think the risk of job loss rises with how binding the minimum wage is; and it's more binding in low wage areas.

arindube	714275432024170496	2016-03-28T02:18:28	JWMason1 Here's my suggestion. I suggest you support a nominally constant minimum wage over time. Why privilege people in 2020 over 2016?
arindube	714274926467932164	2016-03-28T02:16:27	JWMason1 Here's a suggestion: just deflate your nominal wages using the RPP. Then your argument mostly disappears.
arindube	714274395464839168	2016-03-28T02:14:21	JWMason1 Let me put it this way. To rationalize your uniform minimum wage, you need to really dislike workers in NYC where you live :-)
arindube	714273942979145728	2016-03-28T02:12:33	rortybomb JWMason1 True, I mean if you don't like geography, no reason to oppose uniform wage standard across the world.
arindube	714273259173314561	2016-03-28T02:09:50	JWMason1 I think your preference to set min wage w/o attention to cost of living is substantially different from most voters, and myself.
arindube	714272969296621568	2016-03-28T02:08:41	JWMason1 I find it odd that you think it shouldn't matter in setting minimum wages that an apt. in NY costs a lot more in rent than in AL.

arindube	714272043236212736	2016-03-28T02:05:00	JWMason1 Does not follow. "Job losses small" is not a statement about relative size of job loss by labor market. More binding=larger.
arindube	714271280955015169	2016-03-28T02:01:58	JWMason1 Prices reflect wages. That's the nature of spatial equilibrium. Stuff costs a lot more in NYC than in rural Alabama.
arindube	714270908966371329	2016-03-28T02:00:29	JWMason1 We've gone over this before: labor markets are geographic in nature, so marginal costs different by geography (employment, prices)
arindube	714269688805597185	2016-03-28T01:55:38	JWMason1 But $15 in NYC is a very different thing than $15 in rural Alabama. This is a very uncontroversial statement!
arindube	714268922690867200	2016-03-28T01:52:36	JWMason1 I find it odd to advocate for having huge variation in how binding the minimum wage should be across different labor markets.
arindube	714268733913567232	2016-03-28T01:51:51	JWMason1 For many reasons, incl size of job loss, makes little sense to have 50% of workers earning min wage in 1 place, but 20% in another
arindube	714264482554445825	2016-03-28T01:34:57	JWMason1 Hard to say. But if there's job loss, more likely to be in lower wage areas than in higher wage ones.

arindube	710324537821413377	2016-03-17T04:39:01	JWMason1 Min wage's not a great tool to make AL wage structure like MA. Only affects very bottom. Dont ask 1 policy to solve all problems!
arindube	710322537910149120	2016-03-17T04:31:04	JWMason1 I am sorry you don't like the empirical fact that labor markets are constrained by geography!
arindube	710321890741587968	2016-03-17T04:28:30	JWMason1 no. i am assuming that whatever cost increases with bindingness of minimum wage. this is a pretty weak assumption!
arindube	710320943286059008	2016-03-17T04:24:44	JWMason1 well, if you're sure there's no marginal COST at 15 minimum wage anywhere in US then talking about optimal minimum wage pointless!
arindube	710319640023580673	2016-03-17T04:19:33	JWMason1 debate is what level min wage should be. I find it hard to believe an argument that the ideal minimum wage in AL is same as in MA.
arindube	710318991621935104	2016-03-17T04:16:59	JWMason1 my point is not size of optimal RAISE. It's about optimal level of minimum wage. Should be higher in high wage areas.
arindube	710318525425065984	2016-03-17T04:15:08	JWMason1 And labor market flows would strongly go against notion that low wage sectors like restaurant &amp; retail are distinct labor markets
arindube	710317957755305984	2016-03-17T04:12:52	JWMason1 look at actual worker flows. Labor markets for low wage workers are geographically constrained, cross state mobility low.
arindube	710317018596114432	2016-03-17T04:09:08	Because it is an empirically verifiable fact that many lo wage workers switch between McD and WalMart but not bet. MA and CA ..
arindube	710316503065829376	2016-03-17T04:07:06	JWMason1 because most notion of optimal minimum wages relate to labor market wide impact, not for 1 employer or 1 group
arindube	710316071287451648	2016-03-17T04:05:23	JWMason1 hard to see why you'd want 40% of workers to earn min wage in one labor market and 10% in another
arindube	710315614901030912	2016-03-17T04:03:34	JWMason1 employers or groups WITHIN labor market are not the same thing as comparing ACROSS labor markets
arindube	710315376920420352	2016-03-17T04:02:37	JWMason1 if wage distributions across areas are shifted by constant, easy to see why you'd set minimum higher in higher median wage area
