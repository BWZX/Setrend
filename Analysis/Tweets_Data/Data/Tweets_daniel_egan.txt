daniel_egan	694568853620330496	2016-02-02T17:11:33	bencasselman FiveThirtyEight I just wish that story had some weightier ambiguity/uncertainty about what I should take away from it.
daniel_egan	694568708799369216	2016-02-02T17:10:59	bencasselman FiveThirtyEight 8/ I'm not as negative/critical as this probably sounds. You did a great job telling a story.
daniel_egan	694568569774948352	2016-02-02T17:10:26	bencasselman FiveThirtyEight 7/ And you have done transition matrices before, though perhaps low traction? 
daniel_egan	694568367324315648	2016-02-02T17:09:37	bencasselman FiveThirtyEight 6/ Which is tough, sure. But maybe the 'wide public' needs benchmark/framing?
daniel_egan	694567288259940352	2016-02-02T17:05:20	bencasselman FiveThirtyEight 6/ Which is what transition matrices show well:   
daniel_egan	694566924978622464	2016-02-02T17:03:54	bencasselman FiveThirtyEight 5/ The unexamined question is 'what's the right baseline?' If 50% of quart1 move to quart3, is that 'good'?
daniel_egan	694566299373019136	2016-02-02T17:01:24	bencasselman FiveThirtyEight  4/ Assortative mating is increasing, and nature (genes) plays a big primary role, undiscussed in there.
daniel_egan	694565963203764224	2016-02-02T17:00:04	bencasselman FiveThirtyEight 3/ In the absence of any social/nurture effects, one would still expect the average mobility relationship.
daniel_egan	694565786178949120	2016-02-02T16:59:22	bencasselman FiveThirtyEight  2/ Mobility varies greatly across circumstances, meaning simple averages obscure real story.
daniel_egan	694565503344443392	2016-02-02T16:58:15	bencasselman FiveThirtyEight  (deep breath) 1/ The study and write-up were mostly great, but the last para held the key caveat.
daniel_egan	694563821940244481	2016-02-02T16:51:34	bencasselman FiveThirtyEight I know you don't think inequality readers can't handle error bars, but basketball readers can.
daniel_egan	694563542876430337	2016-02-02T16:50:27	bencasselman FiveThirtyEight  Your frequent use of error bars for "wide public" are setting the right standard!
