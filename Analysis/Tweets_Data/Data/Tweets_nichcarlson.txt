nichcarlson	697238436479164416	2016-02-10T01:59:31	Be honest. This is anonymous. Back in June, when Trump entered the race, did you believe he'd ever win a primary?
nichcarlson	697521876797693952	2016-02-10T20:45:49	As a producer of Twitter videos that get buried way too quickly, I’m very, very happy Twitter is trying an algorithm.
nichcarlson	697520445353029632	2016-02-10T20:40:08	seanludwig Maybe. But Bernie’s success makes it clear she had a path this year. Never know what can happen in 4 years. Ask Christie
nichcarlson	697519453274296320	2016-02-10T20:36:11	Similarly…Elizabeth Warren’s time was 2016. If she has presidential ambitions, she blew it not diving in this year.
nichcarlson	697519255357624321	2016-02-10T20:35:24	Chris Christie’s time was 2012, if ever.
nichcarlson	697485774435065861	2016-02-10T18:22:21	rabois Not saying Cruz wouldn’t win in the scenario. Just saying someone could get to 270 by winning 33% in a lot of states.
nichcarlson	697484143752515586	2016-02-10T18:15:53	gaberivera Was that a punch in the face or a tweet? wowza
nichcarlson	697483532969582592	2016-02-10T18:13:27	rabois No reason someone couldn’t get a plurality of the popular vote but a big majority of the electoral vote.

nichcarlson	697464260092366848	2016-02-10T16:56:52	nichcarlson jonathanglick so if you get 25% in FL, you win all of FL’s votes
nichcarlson	697464206862503944	2016-02-10T16:56:39	jonathanglick 25% of each electoral contest
nichcarlson	697462945568202752	2016-02-10T16:51:39	rabois I haven’t done the math. The crazy thing is that such a scenario is not crazy.
nichcarlson	697461153061085185	2016-02-10T16:44:31	Judahe But also Trump and Bernie and Cruz
nichcarlson	697461043128311808	2016-02-10T16:44:05	nichcarlson It might take only 25% to win the vote. Scary!
nichcarlson	697460677628268545	2016-02-10T16:42:38	What if 4 people end up running in the “general” election…Cruz as GOP, Sanders as DEM, Bloomberg as IND, and Trump as IND.
nichcarlson	697457097999523840	2016-02-10T16:28:24	Rubio can’t save himself. He can’t suddenly stop being who he is, and he is Marco Roboto.

nichcarlson	697256007165157376	2016-02-10T03:09:21	I like Trump’s logic: things must be worse than official stats show because otherwise why would people be crazy enough to vote for me?
nichcarlson	697255867746545664	2016-02-10T03:08:47	Jesus, Trump is still pushing the 42% unemployment line. Just crazy.

nichcarlson	682583478517526528	2015-12-31T15:25:57	JoeBucsFan Also, the Bucs haven’t really played any meaningful games since the loss to Saints.  Should JW have been on bench since then?
nichcarlson	682583098786185216	2015-12-31T15:24:27	JoeBucsFan Yep, that’s a scary reality. But…that’s football.
nichcarlson	682581903602528256	2015-12-31T15:19:42	JoeBucsFan I would yes. Jameis needs to get as familiar with the best team in the division as he can. What works against them? What doesn't
nichcarlson	682564794214412288	2015-12-31T14:11:43	sgw94 It was like he was watching a different game
nichcarlson	682557565448884224	2015-12-31T13:42:59	JoeBucsFan Love you guys but benching Jameis is a terrible idea. This whole season served one purpose: getting him reps. Why stop now?
