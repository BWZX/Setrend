sethmnookin	704841387993333761	2016-03-02T01:30:56	Put simply: Ryan's rhetoric doesn't square w/bogus voter ID efforts, spending 8 yrs treating Obama as illegitimate. Paved way for Trump.
sethmnookin	704840931380498432	2016-03-02T01:29:08	Problem with Paul Ryan saying GOP has no room for racists/is party of Lincoln is it ignores dog whistles of last decade.
