elidourado	720639164031610881	2016-04-14T15:45:40	ivorytowerstyle And it should worry people that our political system is so dysfunctional, yes?
elidourado	720638936838750208	2016-04-14T15:44:46	ivorytowerstyle 90+% of what we spend on is negative sum. So you are hanging your hat on relatively tiny marginal good investments.
elidourado	720638728008572930	2016-04-14T15:43:56	ivorytowerstyle OK, but here’s why I think it’s absurd to focus on that:
elidourado	720638645774983169	2016-04-14T15:43:36	ivorytowerstyle Ideally, LVT, but would even settle for a flat VAT, at whatever rate necessary to balance.
elidourado	720638533778677760	2016-04-14T15:43:09	ivorytowerstyle I would favor a more efficient tax system that raised the revenue necessary to balance the budget.
elidourado	720638004759552000	2016-04-14T15:41:03	ivorytowerstyle I want lower spending of most kinds, and by symmetry, others don’t want lower social spending.
elidourado	720637999520882689	2016-04-14T15:41:02	ivorytowerstyle I am worried about our political ability to manage our long-run fiscal health, including unfunded liabilities.
elidourado	720636573851758592	2016-04-14T15:35:22	ivorytowerstyle Yes. Which is why the “crazy” talk is not helpful.
elidourado	720636476799762432	2016-04-14T15:34:59	ivorytowerstyle Government is wasting resources faster than the market is giving money away.
elidourado	720636150159917056	2016-04-14T15:33:41	ivorytowerstyle Whatever, you can talk about it conceptually. In any case, makes no sense to exclude spending from discussion of deficits.
elidourado	720635724580708352	2016-04-14T15:32:00	ivorytowerstyle And in any case, more investment could come out of spending cuts just as easily as out of tax revenue.
elidourado	720635601461125121	2016-04-14T15:31:30	ivorytowerstyle Sure it does. If we are spending inefficiently, it leaves welfare on the table.
elidourado	720635338117541889	2016-04-14T15:30:28	ivorytowerstyle I said spending.

elidourado	720634551656148993	2016-04-14T15:27:20	ivorytowerstyle LOL, riiiiight.
elidourado	720634057999179776	2016-04-14T15:25:22	ivorytowerstyle And are you equally concerned about spending we are doing with negative returns?
elidourado	720632976502059009	2016-04-14T15:21:04	ivorytowerstyle Let me put it this way: I’m more worried about fiscal politics than fiscal economics.
elidourado	720630245909512195	2016-04-14T15:10:13	USA is still the leper with the most fingers. No crisis soon. Still, it’s not crazy to worry about America’s long-run fiscal health.
elidourado	720627830942511104	2016-04-14T15:00:38	evelyn_a_smith Correct. Also any talk of cutting spending threatens their favorite programs, and so deficit talk must be opposed.

elidourado	693498946220523520	2016-01-30T18:20:08	Hunger isn’t in your stomach or your blood-sugar levels. It’s in your mind. 
elidourado	693495751016484864	2016-01-30T18:07:26	Noahpinion ModeledBehavior When we markets based on Bayesian networks, they will be more accurate.
elidourado	693495567884931072	2016-01-30T18:06:42	Noahpinion ModeledBehavior Another problem of course is that it’s costly to explicitly arbitrage these conditional markets.
elidourado	693495326473228289	2016-01-30T18:05:45	Noahpinion ModeledBehavior Right, right. I’m with you.
elidourado	693493519550275584	2016-01-30T17:58:34	Noahpinion ModeledBehavior Yep, which is why I made illiquid markets lightly colored. I hope people won’t pay much attention to them.

elidourado	693098890275504132	2016-01-29T15:50:27	bergmayer Ha! Well, CRISPR is coming, but I don’t think too many people will volunteer for that.

elidourado	692869000137543681	2016-01-29T00:36:57	knowledgeprob SamuelPatt It’s just that some people think you can have a secure blockchain without a currency at all. I don’t see it.
elidourado	692868714522226689	2016-01-29T00:35:49	pierre_rochard That’s true, but keep in mind that markets are measuring probability over all world states.
elidourado	692868529662464002	2016-01-29T00:35:05	nktpnd The conditional estimate assumes the only path to victory is through a major party, so not surprising.

elidourado	692852508360728576	2016-01-28T23:31:25	SamuelPatt knowledgeprob Right, exactly. My beef is with people who are pro-blockchain but anti-bitcoin.
elidourado	692842498029301764	2016-01-28T22:51:38	In that sense, it's unclear whether we should blame trade, or broken reallocation mechanisms
elidourado	692833326403555328	2016-01-28T22:15:11	knowledgeprob A lot of non-currency applications are important, but people must remember that they’re not separable from Bitcoin-as-money!
elidourado	692828648328531968	2016-01-28T21:56:36	knowledgeprob #5 is interesting but again I’m not sure it’s a blockchain exactly. Ordinary p2p network should be fine.
elidourado	692828636039233536	2016-01-28T21:56:33	knowledgeprob #4 can be done on Bitcoin and is indeed already being done on Bitcoin. 
elidourado	692828616628027393	2016-01-28T21:56:28	knowledgeprob #2 is just Bitcoin. #3 is interesting and we have some research forthcoming on it.
elidourado	692828608667205632	2016-01-28T21:56:27	knowledgeprob I am a fan of #1, p2p exchanges (such as OpenBazaar), but they are not blockchains as far as I can tell, just p2p.

elidourado	692057396307451904	2016-01-26T18:51:55	ivorytowerstyle Noahpinion Correct, totally agree.
elidourado	692056841325580290	2016-01-26T18:49:43	ivorytowerstyle Noahpinion Yeah, I’m not saying 100% regulations. 1950s-style education system also dampens dynamism, for instance.
elidourado	692055631126253568	2016-01-26T18:44:54	ivorytowerstyle Noahpinion If we doubled the current “level” of regulation, do you think it would have a negative effect? I do.
elidourado	692055479737061376	2016-01-26T18:44:18	ivorytowerstyle Noahpinion Time series are hard, measuring regulations is hard, measuring economies is hard, etc.
elidourado	692054131134042112	2016-01-26T18:38:57	ivorytowerstyle Noahpinion It’s a very interesting result. I know the RegData guys well.
elidourado	692053684977549312	2016-01-26T18:37:10	ivorytowerstyle Noahpinion We’re both familiar with that paper, but also doesn’t capture lots of occupational licensing, etc.
elidourado	692051859117314048	2016-01-26T18:29:55	Noahpinion Not even free solar panels?
elidourado	692050739217195008	2016-01-26T18:25:28	Noahpinion Maybe. But also if China decided to just give us a bunch of free stuff, I think we should accept and adjust, no?
elidourado	692050160071892995	2016-01-26T18:23:10	Noahpinion I say keep free trade and work on getting markets to adjust more quickly. As you might say, MOAR DYNAMISM.
elidourado	692048803155808256	2016-01-26T18:17:46	Noahpinion To what extent do you think slow labor market adjustment to trade shocks is caused by labor regulations?

elidourado	692022505884745730	2016-01-26T16:33:17	binarybits In any case, very good piece.
elidourado	692022271540617217	2016-01-26T16:32:21	binarybits Fair enough, possibly wishful thinking on my part.
elidourado	692007472777859072	2016-01-26T15:33:33	pierre_rochard bitstein I suspect if Core doesn’t compromise, people will shift to Classic.
elidourado	692006042566311936	2016-01-26T15:27:52	pierre_rochard I think Core is going to have to compromise on the order.
elidourado	692005558816260096	2016-01-26T15:25:56	pierre_rochard The extreme small blockist position as I understand it: We won’t tolerate 2MB until after SegWit and Lightning are deployed.
elidourado	692004420033351680	2016-01-26T15:21:25	pierre_rochard But that’s a lead-in to his SegWit reference. That’s not the kind of compromise I mean.
elidourado	692003240691507201	2016-01-26T15:16:44	It’s not just one side vs. another side. It’s two extremes plus moderates who realize that compromise will be necessary.
elidourado	692003070180507649	2016-01-26T15:16:03	I think binarybits misses the fact that there is a growing contingent of moderates that want 2MB + SegWit + Lightning + RBF.

elidourado	688714273015644161	2016-01-17T13:27:33	topynate starkness binarybits jacoxnet That’s fair. Still I don’t find the affirmative case *for* soft forks to be persuasive.
elidourado	688712440264130561	2016-01-17T13:20:16	topynate starkness binarybits jacoxnet That’s part of it. Also that alleged benefits of soft fork are not a free lunch.
elidourado	688711443882049536	2016-01-17T13:16:18	topynate starkness binarybits jacoxnet Right, some majority rejects, some minority accepts, there is a fork, takes time to resolve.
elidourado	688710335033913344	2016-01-17T13:11:54	topynate starkness binarybits jacoxnet Soft fork mentality lulls people into thinking it’s OK to use outdated software. It’s not.
elidourado	688710042569289729	2016-01-17T13:10:44	topynate starkness binarybits jacoxnet Another way to put it is that hard forks create stronger network effects.
elidourado	688709908947202048	2016-01-17T13:10:12	topynate starkness binarybits jacoxnet Mining power of the chain gets split for no good reason. Less security on the main chain.
elidourado	688709901447774209	2016-01-17T13:10:10	topynate starkness binarybits jacoxnet No. Say they’re running up to date client, but malicious actor is publishing invalid tx.
elidourado	688709088226754560	2016-01-17T13:06:56	topynate starkness binarybits jacoxnet How about ordinary users, who then have to wait fewer confirmations?
elidourado	688708701021167617	2016-01-17T13:05:24	topynate starkness binarybits jacoxnet Therefore, better for “the network” in some sense, yes?
elidourado	688708615440584705	2016-01-17T13:05:04	topynate starkness binarybits jacoxnet Hard forks lead to faster and more reliable network consensus, require fewer confirmations, etc.
elidourado	688708277119619073	2016-01-17T13:03:43	topynate starkness binarybits jacoxnet The penalty for individual miners is worse. Network ends up with stronger security.
elidourado	688707697462620160	2016-01-17T13:01:25	topynate starkness binarybits jacoxnet Hard forks create stronger incentives to upgrade nodes, yes?
elidourado	688707602063183876	2016-01-17T13:01:02	topynate starkness binarybits jacoxnet Whether they will or not is endogenous to whether it’s a hard or soft fork!
elidourado	688707011362615297	2016-01-17T12:58:41	topynate starkness binarybits jacoxnet Which is why hard forks should be announced well in advance and triggered by large majority.
elidourado	688705939785011200	2016-01-17T12:54:26	topynate starkness binarybits jacoxnet Meanwhile, a malicious actor can repeatedly cause blockchain forks after a soft fork.
elidourado	688705924723269633	2016-01-17T12:54:22	topynate starkness binarybits jacoxnet So nodes are forced to upgrade and then they get their money back. 1-time problem.
elidourado	688704616003932160	2016-01-17T12:49:10	topynate starkness binarybits jacoxnet Yes, *after* a race between forks. In short run, weaker chain can pull ahead.
elidourado	688703684046381056	2016-01-17T12:45:28	topynate starkness binarybits jacoxnet Probably because miners have in fact all upgraded and are validating. Same as hard fork.
elidourado	688702869978091520	2016-01-17T12:42:14	starkness binarybits jacoxnet Soft forks mean some nodes no longer fully validate. Easy attack: invalid segwit tx. Forks the blockchain.
elidourado	688591728257974273	2016-01-17T05:20:36	starkness binarybits jacoxnet I’m familiar with segwit, but I don’t buy the argument that soft forks are better than hard forks.

elidourado	688095620805083140	2016-01-15T20:29:14	jacoxnet Noahpinion binarybits True! And to be clear, I support moderately bigger blocks. Just explaining the opposite position.
elidourado	688094979512745984	2016-01-15T20:26:41	jacoxnet Noahpinion binarybits But this is most harmful when it decreases the number of miners.
elidourado	688094886474682372	2016-01-15T20:26:19	jacoxnet Noahpinion binarybits Correct, it’s the full validation that becomes expensive.
elidourado	688034379667488770	2016-01-15T16:25:53	Weird. I just made a Bitcoin transaction. Paid a low fee, was confirmed within a couple of minutes. Could have sworn I read Bitcoin failed?

elidourado	688090186669027328	2016-01-15T20:07:39	Noahpinion binarybits Of course, it depends on the elasticity! Q up, P down, revenue ambiguous.
elidourado	688090082704781312	2016-01-15T20:07:14	Noahpinion binarybits The decline in the block subsidy is “necessary” to cap total supply, yes.
elidourado	688089939876130820	2016-01-15T20:06:40	Noahpinion binarybits Possibly. Let’s say blocks were 1GB right now. Very few miners, and lots of space in blocks so little fee revenue.
elidourado	688089782803656704	2016-01-15T20:06:02	Noahpinion binarybits But that will change, eventually go down to zero. Will be 12.5 later in 2016.
elidourado	688089664373305344	2016-01-15T20:05:34	Noahpinion binarybits The miner revenue is not really a big deal right now, because each block has a reward of 25 BTC + tx fees.
elidourado	688089207215157249	2016-01-15T20:03:45	Noahpinion binarybits It’s not subgame perfect to exclude a transaction a block you mine if there is space and the transaction fee &gt; 0!
elidourado	688088697904979968	2016-01-15T20:01:44	Noahpinion binarybits Less miner revenue means less hashing which means less security, a lower cost of attacking the network.
elidourado	688088693106708480	2016-01-15T20:01:43	Noahpinion binarybits Furthermore, big blocks decrease the price of transaction fees and therefore may harm miner revenue.
elidourado	688088682797072384	2016-01-15T20:01:40	Noahpinion binarybits They can threaten to jail the handful of big miners if they process a transaction in some prohibited class.
elidourado	688088676627263488	2016-01-15T20:01:39	Noahpinion binarybits When the network becomes more centralized, then it becomes easier for governments to censor.
elidourado	688088671854137344	2016-01-15T20:01:38	Noahpinion binarybits If it’s more expensive to be a miner, fewer people will do it, and the network will become more centralized.
elidourado	688088666900684800	2016-01-15T20:01:36	Noahpinion binarybits Mostly because it takes more resources to be a fully validating miner when there are big blocks.
