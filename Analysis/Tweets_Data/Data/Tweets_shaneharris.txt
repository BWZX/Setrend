shaneharris	704451998192705536	2016-02-29T23:43:39	This is a decisive win for Apple. I see no other way to read it—but welcome suggestions. Eviscerates the government's position.
shaneharris	704451705145040896	2016-02-29T23:42:29	Important: Judge also sides w/ Apple that even if AWA applied, complying w/ warrant would impose "undue burden" on Apple.

shaneharris	704445382210691073	2016-02-29T23:17:21	PS, Apple is right on the history of that argument. Congress had the chance to apply the law to "info services" providers and said no.
shaneharris	704444663466307584	2016-02-29T23:14:30	Judge agrees w/ key Apple argument: Congress considered, but declined, to adopt law that wld explicitly force it to assist w/ the warrant.

shaneharris	702964885248868352	2016-02-25T21:14:23	shaneharris Perhaps, but no one knows what the limits are of the all writs act, if DOJ prevails.
shaneharris	702966701957234688	2016-02-25T21:21:36	maxjrosenthal True. But I"m not sure Apple really believes such dire scenarios would come to pass. This brief is rather artful.
