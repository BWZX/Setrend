syouth1	725823018023395328	2016-04-28T23:04:27	EconomPic TMFHousel this is more consistent with the data. Higher active share correlates with wider dispersion of returns not success.
syouth1	725822080902676485	2016-04-28T23:00:43	EconomPic TMFHousel yep I agree. I think the point I'm trying to make, feebly at that, is about the linearity of relationship as AS rises
syouth1	725821678496940032	2016-04-28T22:59:07	EconomPic TMFHousel I don't think the data supports that. Active share calc also very sensitive to BM chosen.

syouth1	697426440300716032	2016-02-10T14:26:35	ScopeHockey michaelbatnick Good ? It is much more focused/deep value (cheapest 20 wide-moat stocks on qtrly basis) than broader WM index.
syouth1	697425105484443648	2016-02-10T14:21:17	michaelbatnick Those are M* indexes that contain stocks that M* analysts have rated by quality. Unfortunately, only goes back to early-00s.
syouth1	697424927520071681	2016-02-10T14:20:34	michaelbatnick This is pretty crude/unsophisticated, but some stats on equity perf by 'quality' (as we define it).

syouth1	697419702084231168	2016-02-10T13:59:49	michaelbatnick We have our own 'quality' definition here ('moat' we call it) and indexes tied to that. Cld look at downside capt of those?

syouth1	697215572837339136	2016-02-10T00:28:40	ServoWealth I'll take a look at the data when I get home. My guess is you've got some outliers pulling the avg down but perhaps I'm wrong!
