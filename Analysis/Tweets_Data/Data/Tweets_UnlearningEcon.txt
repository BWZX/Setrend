UnlearningEcon	704442749634875395	2016-02-29T23:06:54	Noahpinion I could name more mainstream economists who I think argue in good faith than you've had hot dinners
UnlearningEcon	704430838562291712	2016-02-29T22:19:34	Noahpinion there it is again, that switch between methodology and particular theories. This is why I think you're arguing in bad faith
UnlearningEcon	704426677217181696	2016-02-29T22:03:02	Noahpinion but even science is home to a variety of methods. Asking PKs for a unified one is a snipe hunt
UnlearningEcon	704425628284624898	2016-02-29T21:58:52	Noahpinion I wish I could believe that, but I don't see much evidence that you're engaging in good faith. It's not even clear what you want

UnlearningEcon	704423298688524289	2016-02-29T21:49:36	Noahpinion besides, where is this concise, coherent statement of mainstream methodology? Economists basically never discuss methodology
UnlearningEcon	704423170279907328	2016-02-29T21:49:06	Noahpinion methodology comes with jargon. You don't like it, don't ask for methodology. But don't call everything you're unfamiliar with BS
UnlearningEcon	704422451594338304	2016-02-29T21:46:14	Noahpinion we can't win. If we give you theories it's 'but there's no unified methodology!' if methodology 'ew airy jargon!'

UnlearningEcon	703881455680806912	2016-02-28T09:56:31	dave_chivers Noahpinion also Minsky is inherently disequilibrium. Hence when Krugman put Minsky in an OLG model he completely botched it

UnlearningEcon	703880547697876994	2016-02-28T09:52:54	Noahpinion not at all, but intuition and feeling around a problem are often a starting point to something more systemic. See: John Snow

UnlearningEcon	703879550833442816	2016-02-28T09:48:57	Noahpinion but there is a lot of intuition pandering in mainstream econ, too. At the risk of sounding trite, the world is v. complex &amp;

UnlearningEcon	697179082916761601	2016-02-09T22:03:40	m0veablebeast smart folks argue for religion, too, don't make it right. I'd prefer debt write offs, fiscal stimulus &amp; financial reform
UnlearningEcon	697178567927603201	2016-02-09T22:01:38	DanMKervick also odd given that they seem to be insisting contemporary CBs are largely incompetent

UnlearningEcon	697176313015230464	2016-02-09T21:52:40	What's worst about this view is that no matter what happens, its proponents can still insist that the policy wasn't truly followed
UnlearningEcon	697176071045804032	2016-02-09T21:51:42	This view is so wrong and I really fear it will eventually become policy:

UnlearningEcon	696454709981405184	2016-02-07T22:05:17	pdmsero JoMicheII bswud the piece simply suggests they think 'secular stagnation' is more recent than the period analysed in the paper

UnlearningEcon	696447900986044417	2016-02-07T21:38:13	JoMicheII pdmsero bswud exactly. The point is not that growth has never been exponential but that in recent decades it may have changed..
UnlearningEcon	696439948417835008	2016-02-07T21:06:37	It's worrying that economists spend so little time formally testing fundamental assumptions such as exponential growth
