mattocko	714214420008673280	2016-03-27T22:16:01	14/ In summary: US laws blocking construction do exist, their effects are not always good, and they increase price of basic infrastructure.
mattocko	714213856038375424	2016-03-27T22:13:47	13/ Third, "moar roads" aren't even possible in the US. $787B meant nothing. Building fast &amp; cheap is illegal. 
mattocko	714213605302886400	2016-03-27T22:12:47	12/ That is: self-driving cars, ride-sharing, drone delivery, and hyperloops take cars *off* the roads. Like email reduced need for postmen.
mattocko	714213426654896129	2016-03-27T22:12:05	11/ Second, "moar roads" is to self-driving cars roughly what "moar postmen" is to email.
mattocko	714213137671532544	2016-03-27T22:10:56	10/ First, roads aren't innovation. The Interstate Highway was innovative in 1950. Not anymore. Every country has roads. Table stakes.
mattocko	714212683940147200	2016-03-27T22:09:07	9/ As for the non-sequitur of "moar ROADS", it's so dumb that it will require a few tweets to disassemble.
mattocko	714212489194438656	2016-03-27T22:08:21	8/ So that's why if you want to build a hyperloop, you go abroad. Exit the US and the West.  
mattocko	714211697158807552	2016-03-27T22:05:12	7/ If Obama + $787B can't build a bridge, how hard do you think it is to build a hyperloop?  
mattocko	714210273582649344	2016-03-27T21:59:33	6/ Point: it's not the cost of raw material that is driving the high price of US infrastructure. It's the cost of antiquated US laws.
mattocko	714210084520210432	2016-03-27T21:58:48	5/ The less obvious result is that these laws push innovation in construction overseas. For example: 
mattocko	714209798409965568	2016-03-27T21:57:39	4/ The obvious consequence is to increase the price of building basic infrastructure to the point of infeasibility. 
mattocko	714208773779300352	2016-03-27T21:53:35	3/ First, for specific laws hindering construction, this is a good overview.
