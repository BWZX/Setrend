JosephineCumbo	725252455123001345	2016-04-27T09:17:14	Altmann asked if she was still pension minister in 2020, what would her gut instinct be on the future of the triple lock.

JosephineCumbo	707523458096369665	2016-03-09T11:08:32	Altmann says "I am clear we need to get to 8% first. You don't want to make it so draconian at first that people opt out."

JosephineCumbo	707519338908160000	2016-03-09T10:52:10	What Altmann may be referring to is the fact the Regulator does not have power to require schemes to hand over data.
JosephineCumbo	707519256288579584	2016-03-09T10:51:50	Altmann says she would like the Regulator to have powers to require schemes to do certain things, which they currently can't.
JosephineCumbo	707519009021960193	2016-03-09T10:50:51	An MP says that we have "opened a powerful stream" of worry on Master Trusts.
JosephineCumbo	707518837873319937	2016-03-09T10:50:10	Altmann says she is keen to give the Pensions Regulator more powers.
JosephineCumbo	707518556519407616	2016-03-09T10:49:03	Altmann says the costs of a Master Trust wind up could be borne by members, under current framework.
JosephineCumbo	707518294450950144	2016-03-09T10:48:01	One MP states "It is incredible that we have got to this point" with a vulnerability (Master Trust regulation) hard-wired into the system.
JosephineCumbo	707518088971943936	2016-03-09T10:47:12	Altmann says the concerns with the Master Trust market are with the small providers.
JosephineCumbo	707517707042824193	2016-03-09T10:45:41	Great question from the Committee.  Why wasn't the issue of Master Trust market dealt with much earlier?
JosephineCumbo	707517566600744960	2016-03-09T10:45:07	Altmann says there is not protection for pension savers in the event of a wind up of a Master Trust.
JosephineCumbo	707517050143510529	2016-03-09T10:43:04	pensionschamp stevewebb1 may have some thoughts on this.

JosephineCumbo	707515451572666372	2016-03-09T10:36:43	With both Regulator &amp; pensions minister expressing concerns about Master Trust market, why is Govt not creating space 4 legislation now?
JosephineCumbo	707514832191356929	2016-03-09T10:34:15	The Committee did not ask what the ramifications were if legislation to strengthen Master Trust market could not be put in place this year.

JosephineCumbo	707514429366267904	2016-03-09T10:32:39	Altmann is concerned that the costs of a Master Trust wind up "don't fall on members. Legislation is needed to do this.
JosephineCumbo	707514229973245952	2016-03-09T10:31:52	Altmann is still bidding for a Pensions Bill to enact greater protections for the Master Trust market.

JosephineCumbo	707513961521004544	2016-03-09T10:30:48	Altmann says legislation is needed to put in place proper protections in the Master Trust market.
JosephineCumbo	707513776493498368	2016-03-09T10:30:03	"There is an issue with Master Trusts and I am very anxious that we have proper protections in place," said Altmann.
JosephineCumbo	707513375287328768	2016-03-09T10:28:28	Altmann says she wants providers to look after their products and offer good pensions.
JosephineCumbo	707513307943534592	2016-03-09T10:28:12	Helping employers understand what automatic enrolment is all about is a key issue alongside keeping people in the pension, says Altmann.
JosephineCumbo	707513100979867648	2016-03-09T10:27:22	"I don't want to see lots of small employers facing fines for not doing something inadvertently or because it was 2 difficult" says Altmann.
JosephineCumbo	707512931664207872	2016-03-09T10:26:42	Altmann says with a programme as 'massive' as automatic enrolment, there are a 'huge number of areas of concern' about its roll out.

JosephineCumbo	707509386940440576	2016-03-09T10:12:37	Titcomb said the Regulator only hears from HMRC that a new Master Trust has been registered. "There are no gateway checks" she says.
JosephineCumbo	707509107398479872	2016-03-09T10:11:30	Lesley Titcomb was frank about the shortcomings of Master Trust regulation, repeating concerns that some are unsustainable.

JosephineCumbo	707508650500300800	2016-03-09T10:09:41	Making the Master Trust Assurance framework mandatory is one of the options being considered by the DWP and the Regulator.
JosephineCumbo	707508323696943104	2016-03-09T10:08:23	Titcomb says they are going out and speaking to Master Trusts and asking them about their business models.

JosephineCumbo	707506382237515776	2016-03-09T10:00:41	Counsell asked about the outcome of those investigations?  He says one employer was asked 'to put right what had gone wrong'.
JosephineCumbo	707506238888742916	2016-03-09T10:00:06	About half of those 60 whistle-blowing reports are being investigated.
JosephineCumbo	707506050514157568	2016-03-09T09:59:21	Regulator has received about 60 whisteblowing reports about employers wrongly inducing staff to opt out.
JosephineCumbo	707505739754049536	2016-03-09T09:58:07	Titcomb says Regulator keeps records of letters sent to employers about auto-enrolment. The letters are in brown envelopes, like HMRC.
JosephineCumbo	707505556978868226	2016-03-09T09:57:24	How many small businesses will we hear who weren't told about auto-enrolment asks Richard Graham MP? "There will be some" replies Counsell.
JosephineCumbo	707505327714004992	2016-03-09T09:56:29	Employers are more likely to incur costs if they leave their auto-enrolment duties to the last minute says Counsell.
JosephineCumbo	707504836665806853	2016-03-09T09:54:32	In the first quarter of this year, 100,000 employers will need to stage, and in total 500,000 will over 2016.

JosephineCumbo	707503336833097728	2016-03-09T09:48:34	Counsell says if an employer has a higher than average opt out rate for the pension, that is a red flag.
JosephineCumbo	707503117521256448	2016-03-09T09:47:42	Counsell says the Regulator has received whisteblowing complaints from people concerned about employers inducing staff to opt out of pension
JosephineCumbo	707502961958772737	2016-03-09T09:47:05	Non compliance levels "much lower" than initial projections, says Counsell.
JosephineCumbo	707502753413799936	2016-03-09T09:46:15	Titcomb says they are also relying on whisteblowers to alert them to employers avoiding the duties.
JosephineCumbo	707502582361673728	2016-03-09T09:45:35	Counsell says switching PAYE schemes can push back staging date. "It is not really a helpful thing for the employer to do".
JosephineCumbo	707502491785687045	2016-03-09T09:45:13	Lesley Titcomb says regulator has seen examples of people switching PAYE schemes to avoid automatic enrolment duties.
JosephineCumbo	707502314622418944	2016-03-09T09:44:31	Counsell says different approach taken with people employing care assistants. "They may need more help to become compliant".
JosephineCumbo	707501809099739136	2016-03-09T09:42:30	Compliance letters which are sent out are like 'red gas bills' says Charles Counsell of the tPR.

JosephineCumbo	707501000647700480	2016-03-09T09:39:17	Counsell says communications are tailored for specific types of employers - such as those employing care assistants.
JosephineCumbo	707500592613236736	2016-03-09T09:37:40	Counsell says through HMRC data, the Regulator does know who is and who isn't engaging with their automatic enrolment duties.
JosephineCumbo	707500304246374400	2016-03-09T09:36:31	Lesley Titcomb says the regulator will tweak its communications if it needs to.
JosephineCumbo	707500213892751362	2016-03-09T09:36:10	Counsell says the Regulator is targeting smaller employers via direct mail outs, trade bodies and regional media.

JosephineCumbo	706022299254784001	2016-03-05T07:43:28	The fact that Treasury was looking at idea of restricting the Pension ISA to young people showed they were looking for ways to introduce.
JosephineCumbo	706022134666141697	2016-03-05T07:42:48	paullewismoney I cannot see a wholesale switch to the Pension ISA ever getting off the ground. There was too much opposition.

JosephineCumbo	706019362537381890	2016-03-05T07:31:47	I quite liked the idea of "tax relief", which is poorly understood, being re-branded a 'top up' or 'savers' bonus' as many suggested.
JosephineCumbo	706018740308148224	2016-03-05T07:29:19	There is still room for Osborne to tinker in the Budget - he could look to again restrict the Lifetime or Annual Allowances.
JosephineCumbo	706017994787446786	2016-03-05T07:26:21	Osborne has a stack of ideas to reform the system; to make it simpler, more transparent and fairer. We may yet see an options paper.
JosephineCumbo	706017453315334144	2016-03-05T07:24:12	The consultation did flush out a large body of support for a switch to a more progressive flat rate of tax relief, even among Tory MPs.
JosephineCumbo	706016951261384705	2016-03-05T07:22:12	However, it is difficult to see how the Pension ISA could be carried forward at a later date, given strength and depth of opposition to it.

JosephineCumbo	697428460998959104	2016-02-10T14:34:37	Govt also flags up the prospect of a a 'whitelist' of approved pension providers.
JosephineCumbo	697426850675613696	2016-02-10T14:28:13	40% of consumers who took part in an online survey run by HMT said their pension transfer took more than 91 days.
JosephineCumbo	697425080096288768	2016-02-10T14:21:11	HMT: Many providers, company occupational schemes and trade bodies did not support either a cap on all early exit fees or a flexible cap.

JosephineCumbo	697422211343372289	2016-02-10T14:09:47	HMT: This evidence suggests that consumers and providers may have different perceptions about the impact of an early exit charge.
JosephineCumbo	697422069185777664	2016-02-10T14:09:13	Conversely, a "large number" of consumers told HMT that their early exit charge made it too expensive to exercise the pension freedoms.
JosephineCumbo	697421829611376640	2016-02-10T14:08:16	Most providers who responded to HMT's consultation said early exit charges had not impacted on members’ decisions to access pension freedoms
JosephineCumbo	697420643965517824	2016-02-10T14:03:33	The Pension Regulator does not powers to require pension schemes to provide data - a nugget from HMT's consultation response today.
JosephineCumbo	697419930652823552	2016-02-10T14:00:43	HMT: Average pension transfer times for contract-based pensions schemes is 16 days versus 39 days for trust-based pension schemes.

JosephineCumbo	683590968398970880	2016-01-03T10:09:22	sippyslicker pensionmonkey pensionschamp yes clearly it's a 'means to an end' strategy. Point that out &amp; your motives are questioned.
