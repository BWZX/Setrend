ananavarro	712610997777907713	2016-03-23T12:04:36	Wait. I thought BernieSanders was all but politically dead in primary. Seems Democrats in Idaho &amp; Utah didn't get the memo. FeelTheBern
ananavarro	712609938028290048	2016-03-23T12:00:23	Wow. Last night there was a state where the voting was all screwed-up &amp; lines lasted hours...and it wasn't Florida!

ananavarro	712300271490228224	2016-03-22T15:29:53	True. 
ananavarro	712300130620325888	2016-03-22T15:29:19	May be different answers, but Brussels reminds us when voting, we should ask: Who has the temperament, grit &amp; ability to combat terrorism?

ananavarro	706301454051635200	2016-03-06T02:12:43	Marco needs stellar debate on Thurs. He'll have wind in his sails from home town crowd. And he's done well in debates when back against wall
ananavarro	706300649152094208	2016-03-06T02:09:31	He'd be crazy to exit B4 FL. Stands chance of winning state. Whatever may happen after that, he'd have big victory. 
ananavarro	706299126493929472	2016-03-06T02:03:28	Think it's true. GOP absentees so impt in FL. Organization really matters. Marco has a good one. Trump, not so much. 
ananavarro	706298294801199105	2016-03-06T02:00:10	Note to katiepack...I got a passing grade in high school  math. 
ananavarro	706297205137739776	2016-03-06T01:55:50	Marco has best ground op in FL. But tonight's narrative will hurt. What's antonym for "momentum"...Shit out of luck?

ananavarro	706290673306173440	2016-03-06T01:29:53	What for? 1) makes no difference; 2) I'll support last survivor on the island w/path to nomination, who isn't Trump. 
ananavarro	706289221837914112	2016-03-06T01:24:07	Don't know what Jeb will do. No fairy-godfather. Can't sprinkle magic dust on MR &amp; poof! path 2 nomination appears. 
ananavarro	706285661599440896	2016-03-06T01:09:58	Well, yes. There's that. 
ananavarro	706285590090792961	2016-03-06T01:09:41	Yeah, right. And I could be the next Olympic ice skating gold medal winner.... 
ananavarro	706285017672974336	2016-03-06T01:07:25	He's not going anywhere B4 FL. If beats Trump in our homestate, he'll have a good night. It's for all the marbles.

ananavarro	706249221607915520	2016-03-05T22:45:10	Getting in mud w/Trump didn't help either. Hard to out-mud-sling Trump &amp; paid cost of looking unserious &amp; juvenile. 
ananavarro	706230382518206466	2016-03-05T21:30:18	Don't think he'd sweep. But undoubtedly, a Trump win in FL would make it a yuge good night for him 
ananavarro	706227701229740035	2016-03-05T21:19:39	No se. Marco endorsed by GOP Gov in KS &amp; getting beat like a drum. Not sure endorsements help much anywhere this yr. 
ananavarro	706226386357395456	2016-03-05T21:14:26	Doubt it. His invested and has a lot riding on FL, 9 days away.

ananavarro	706223040800149504	2016-03-05T21:01:08	Oy. I think we just officially scraped the bottom of the barrel. 
ananavarro	706217394868494338	2016-03-05T20:38:42	Winning your home state is a litmus test. Cruz passed it in TX. Cruz playing in FL in hopes Marco fails &amp; exits. 
ananavarro	706214972615958528	2016-03-05T20:29:04	Hmmm...good point. Given my record this cycle, my gut telling me Marco organized &amp; closing gap in FL = He's screwed. 
ananavarro	706212810099978242	2016-03-05T20:20:29	My gut tells me this is right. Organization matters in getting out vote, incl absentees in FL. Marco well organized. 
ananavarro	706144873305481216	2016-03-05T15:50:31	Good for donnabrazile on the ground, helping out in Flint today. Jean &amp; Lionel wld be proud.

ananavarro	705789320532238336	2016-03-04T16:17:41	Saw Cruz presser. I don't much agree w/him or like his style. But at least has base of knowledge, isn't crass &amp; disgusting. Low-bar in 2016.
ananavarro	705763808002838529	2016-03-04T14:36:18	It's not even 10AM and Trump already talking about "Little Marco" and "Lyin' Ted". The man knows branding.

ananavarro	703036678819020801	2016-02-26T01:59:40	Cruz may not speak Spanish well, but I think the dude had his Cuban coffee tonight. He came ready and fully loaded.
ananavarro	703036402997399552	2016-02-26T01:58:34	Cruz and Rubio effectively tag-teaming Trump, but Trump getting some still managing to get some shots in.
ananavarro	703036135279194113	2016-02-26T01:57:31	Cruz already doing better in this debate than the last two lackluster performances.
ananavarro	703035759566041088	2016-02-26T01:56:01	Took a while, but glad to see Marco finally taking the gloves off and going after Trump.

ananavarro	702267280755916802	2016-02-23T23:02:21	"Nevada" Sounds pretty much the same in Spanish regardless which country you are from. 
ananavarro	702266107097444352	2016-02-23T22:57:42	Look folks, if it gets to hard just use Spanish pronunciation of "Nevada". We only have one way to say it. 
ananavarro	702220125236240384	2016-02-23T19:54:59	Nah. Not really. Way too many body issues to spend any time looking at my reflection in the water. üôà

ananavarro	701981526217650177	2016-02-23T04:06:52	Every so often, need to leave the political bubble and read an inspirational story that does the heart good. 
ananavarro	701979189205983232	2016-02-23T03:57:35	Good piece by AshleyRParker. Captures my friend, jebbush, his warts &amp; authenticity. He fought &amp; lost on his terms.

ananavarro	701391648706719746	2016-02-21T13:02:54	I suspect he'd rather pluck his eyes out than be in the U.S. Senate. Endless debate &amp; pace would be torture for Jeb.
