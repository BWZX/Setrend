GreekFire23	702279534830362625	2016-02-23T23:51:03	Not_Raven the market is searching for the right price to where it's left in the ground
GreekFire23	702279129220177920	2016-02-23T23:49:26	Not_Raven if you don't drill you don't have revenue, you're saying a grocer is selling groceries because they need cash flow
GreekFire23	702278724780236800	2016-02-23T23:47:50	Not_Raven no producer delivers on a forward contract, if they sold forward that was a hedge. The oil comes out of the ground non-stop
GreekFire23	702278464683040772	2016-02-23T23:46:48	Not_Raven a commodity that has inventories overflowing everywhere goes lower, pick a price between $0 and $31
GreekFire23	702278093730422788	2016-02-23T23:45:19	Not_Raven no, they are selling at spot because they have production coming out of the ground and they don't have storage and need revenue
GreekFire23	702277885139296257	2016-02-23T23:44:30	Not_Raven when oil comes out of the ground you have to market it and sell it at spot. They all sell current production at spot
GreekFire23	702277579378704385	2016-02-23T23:43:17	Not_Raven yes for planning purposes companies assume the forward curve not the spot price today
GreekFire23	702277262029299712	2016-02-23T23:42:01	Not_Raven inventories are that bad, Cushing full, Rotterdam full, OECD total 388 million barrels above 5yr average
GreekFire23	702277040934940673	2016-02-23T23:41:08	Not_Raven the spot price is about inventories the contango out the curve is about future expectations of inventories, supply and demand
GreekFire23	702276374485143552	2016-02-23T23:38:29	Not_Raven how do you know producers are selling forward at $35, they aren't. And the 10% front month contango is because of inventories

GreekFire23	683777788998975492	2016-01-03T22:31:43	YiorgosZal a conversation over lunch, not with 140 characters
GreekFire23	683777600259506177	2016-01-03T22:30:58	Copernicus2013 OK chigrl
GreekFire23	683776133557518336	2016-01-03T22:25:08	Copernicus2013 not a trend when the fundamentals are lousy. And money managers are not positioned bearish as you suggest chigrl
GreekFire23	683775491237634048	2016-01-03T22:22:35	Copernicus2013 not for 6 straight years chigrl
GreekFire23	683774532675592192	2016-01-03T22:18:47	RobDemovsky he should give it a go, there's only two games left this season
GreekFire23	683772262642769921	2016-01-03T22:09:45	chigrl Amazing in that it took central banks over 100 years to figure this out
GreekFire23	683771179182755840	2016-01-03T22:05:27	chigrl only commodities still trade on fundamentals....and long bonds. Nothing else.
GreekFire23	683770327646781440	2016-01-03T22:02:04	chigrl overwhelming doom and gloom, you follow the wrong crowd :)
GreekFire23	683768000533639169	2016-01-03T21:52:49	Copernicus2013 still barking up the wrong trees chigrl
GreekFire23	683765727774535681	2016-01-03T21:43:47	YiorgosZal and nobody cares about this subjective and soft OECD data of what they think are reforms
GreekFire23	683765358772248576	2016-01-03T21:42:19	YiorgosZal we've already discussed this before. Your definition of reforms and mine are different.

GreekFire23	683696584161398784	2016-01-03T17:09:02	themostmitsos if Greeks had a leader they trusted to guide them out of the Euro people would go, but right now they feel they have to stay
GreekFire23	683687121635401729	2016-01-03T16:31:26	themostmitsos one day the Greeks will decide to leave the Euro and when that happens real reforms will take place because it'll have to
GreekFire23	683673542156771328	2016-01-03T15:37:29	EU bought time by giving Greece the money they needed to mature the bonds held by EU banks. Greece then hoped to borrow again &amp; never reform
GreekFire23	683672248918618112	2016-01-03T15:32:20	EU strategy with Greece was to cut the deficit, without real reforms, in hopes the markets would then be fooled into buying Greek govt bonds
GreekFire23	683671314972938241	2016-01-03T15:28:38	Greece has done no real reforms since day 1 of the crisis in 2010. Strategy has always been to buy time hoping to borrow again from markets

GreekFire23	683668836785229824	2016-01-03T15:18:47	zerohedge but healthcare services are not transported on rail so this doesn't matter anymore
GreekFire23	683666606686355456	2016-01-03T15:09:55	Always act tough after the bailout, when you run out of money give in and stay in the Euro 
GreekFire23	683534492062093314	2016-01-03T06:24:57	dgenr818 that's different. They are reinvesting pay downs and if people stopped paying their mortgage those bonds stop cash flowing
GreekFire23	683484175144501249	2016-01-03T03:05:00	StvZissou totally. It's asinine finance. But nothing will ever change because investors have one year horizons and want yield
GreekFire23	683483402675339264	2016-01-03T03:01:56	StvZissou the synthetics were created because investors wanted that paper and its yield. People forget wallSt will "create" what ppl demand
GreekFire23	683482547486101508	2016-01-03T02:58:32	StvZissou what made it bad was the on the ground collapse happened just as fast as the market asset prices collapse. You had both dynamics
GreekFire23	683482338064465920	2016-01-03T02:57:42	StvZissou agree, it would've caused a bad recession, the multi-bank collapse probably avoided
GreekFire23	683481872656130049	2016-01-03T02:55:51	StvZissou it was just more fuel to the fire. Without it there'd still be a huge fire

GreekFire23	683475111526154240	2016-01-03T02:28:59	johnidahotweets a popular response so far
GreekFire23	683474916402970624	2016-01-03T02:28:13	15thAveProp hard to say going forward out two years. The current cycle is slowing down again, may or may not drop into recession. Not clear
GreekFire23	683474136690200576	2016-01-03T02:25:07	15thAveProp good stuff...
GreekFire23	683472592167120896	2016-01-03T02:18:58	15thAveProp tell me more...
GreekFire23	683472445098049537	2016-01-03T02:18:23	SalSagev_ who doesn't think the Fed would launch QE4 in a second if there was a major down tick? Their credibility is through the roof.
GreekFire23	683471314569531392	2016-01-03T02:13:54	michaeljordaned true. But when the person stops paying their mortgage and thus stops cash flowing the CDO, it doesn't matter if Fed buys it
GreekFire23	683471040463372288	2016-01-03T02:12:48	The "last" Big Short?.....central banks are too hyper-proactive, too hyper-sensitive to every down tick
GreekFire23	683469126577352704	2016-01-03T02:05:12	JoshBoyd37 but the student loans are federal loans, if there are losses Fed gives money to the Treasury, so that wouldn't work either
GreekFire23	683468385733197824	2016-01-03T02:02:16	elprocurador yes, but people pay their car loans first, even before their mortgage, and they are very short term
GreekFire23	683467053890703360	2016-01-03T01:56:58	What made the Big Short big was it was concentrated in an asset class the Fed couldn't buy; everyone's mortgage. What else can't Fed buy?
GreekFire23	683323761911795713	2016-01-02T16:27:35	WellingtonRandy MktOutperform previous "eras" like 2001-2007? Has more to do with in previous eras stocks were crashing with this data
GreekFire23	683319190627942401	2016-01-02T16:09:25	Another data point in a very long list of data points "not happening ever before outside recession": 
GreekFire23	683318598002159616	2016-01-02T16:07:03	When you predict every year it will be up 8-10% you're not trying to be right
