Beljevina	723538731508977664	2016-04-22T15:47:30	Apparently, ES_F felt it far more important to pause at the textbook tick of last week's close

Beljevina	723181597692829698	2016-04-21T16:08:23	That was a somewhat unexpected ~80¢ trip from 43.1x. Thinking CL_F can't get past pit open as long as ES_F is drip-downing. Watching DX_F

Beljevina	723175700228911104	2016-04-21T15:44:57	gmax1mum It's a judgement call if you're watching the footprint, &amp; can see high (bid) volume (for the session), and then moving price north
Beljevina	723174526155165698	2016-04-21T15:40:17	gmax1mum Yes, sellers were hitting the bid, but, they ran out of (sell) firepower, and, passive bid replenishment held the price

Beljevina	722870314011607040	2016-04-20T19:31:27	They sold &gt;6K+ contracts into that 2105. That's a great topping sign on ES_F CD; likely to hold into the close.

Beljevina	713004176196771840	2016-03-24T14:06:57	The swing low here on CL_F into ~38.50 had lots of reasons to hold; early buy absorption walking us up.

Beljevina	711732693336199169	2016-03-21T01:54:32	chrisadams5656 Depends on the time of day, instrument, &amp; how algos behave in each. IMHO this (asia) 40.65 is real, will get hit, &amp; filled.
Beljevina	711731796585680898	2016-03-21T01:50:58	chrisadams5656 It needs a currently not-present volume of sellers2push down in2it; if they "hit",CL_F can spike down lower,to leave a doji
Beljevina	711731007624380421	2016-03-21T01:47:50	chrisadams5656 Given it is hugely disproportionate to normal Asia bid sizes, filling that can be tough, hence, it may represent a floor.
Beljevina	711730699879845889	2016-03-21T01:46:36	chrisadams5656 Not necessarily. May be some stops, but, someone could also have no qualms about getting filled as a (big) passive buyer.
Beljevina	711730304961126400	2016-03-21T01:45:02	chrisadams5656 Not necessarily.

Beljevina	709794738094735360	2016-03-15T17:33:47	spz_trader Indeed, and Janet for sure can and will, change everything.

Beljevina	708330688450306048	2016-03-11T16:36:10	CL_F price has now bounced 78% off the day's low or range; cmDelta buy pressure far far weaker:it's the index melt-up that's the cause IMHO
Beljevina	708325392176844800	2016-03-11T16:15:08	CL_F now flat on ON cmDelta. 38.21is 78% of yest range &amp; .16=78% of today range.That confluence means she bouncy :)

Beljevina	708301563719245824	2016-03-11T14:40:27	That ES_F to CL_F linkage could be crucial here; a WTI thrash past ~39.10/.28 could mean short is not right.

Beljevina	708139094585507840	2016-03-11T03:54:51	CL_F 38.70-90 is: 1) 161% of last week 2) 127% of last month 3) 127% of Thurs ETH. Won't go much higher IMHO 
Beljevina	708137549747908608	2016-03-11T03:48:43	@CashOutAndRun Yes, but on the whole, a relationship between the two has been indeterminate

Beljevina	707660027138543617	2016-03-09T20:11:12	CTfutures Overall, it is a selling-into-strength story. Eventually, cmDelta direction will carry it back down IMHO 
Beljevina	707657938631004161	2016-03-09T20:02:54	That was about 5000 CL_F contracts sold into the close, into stops. A significant cmDelta doji. Wow.
