adamnagourney	696150203334668288	2016-02-07T01:55:16	This Rubio answer on immigration/gang of 8 is a little hard to diagram.
adamnagourney	696148053431033856	2016-02-07T01:46:44	Rubio appears more rattled than in any other debate by far

adamnagourney	695431533331501057	2016-02-05T02:19:32	I asked BernieSanders yesterday if Obama was a progressive yesterday and he said "generally."
adamnagourney	695430219566419968	2016-02-05T02:14:19	Worth noting: Clinton is definitely not smiling the way she did at earlier debates when asked tough questions. Doubt that's a coincidence.
adamnagourney	695429639288676352	2016-02-05T02:12:01	Wonder how Obama reacts hearing fairly harsh criticism from a Democrat on how Obamacare is working.
adamnagourney	695429318239870980	2016-02-05T02:10:44	So strange, given Clinton's history on healthcare, to hear Sanders portray her as insufficiently ardent on universal coverage. Not right.
