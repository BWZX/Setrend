spencerrascoff	691661436888727552	2016-01-25T16:38:31	MarcyRUrban if you want better data on Zillow, MLS should send a feed. Ending feed makes data worse -- bad for agents and clients.

spencerrascoff	691647472633036800	2016-01-25T15:43:02	CalamariHomes Zillow includes listing agent more prominently than MLS sites or Rupert Murdoch's website.
spencerrascoff	691646875796164612	2016-01-25T15:40:40	MarcyRUrban why does your MLS send a feed to News Corp and rupertmurdoch but not zillow when Zillow has many more homebuyers?
spencerrascoff	691627099598278656	2016-01-25T14:22:05	jonoringer yup. davebei is zillow. In NY, you should also connect w/ Matt streeteasy for easy local note-sharing.
spencerrascoff	691626862896922624	2016-01-25T14:21:08	saketmehta_ jonoringer yes there is one team that just does tech debt. Themselves, and they prod other teams too.
spencerrascoff	691624470835023872	2016-01-25T14:11:38	CalamariHomes You have a friend zillow. We are here to help.
spencerrascoff	691624327674986496	2016-01-25T14:11:04	jonoringer Trulia and StreetEasy product teams don't have a specific tech debt team. Shared responsibility. Also about 10% tho.
spencerrascoff	691624202001072128	2016-01-25T14:10:34	jonoringer Zillow has a dedicate team focused on it. They make sure other product teams do it too.
spencerrascoff	691624061592571904	2016-01-25T14:10:00	jonoringer I'd estimate around 10% of prod dev resources go towards paying down tech debt.
