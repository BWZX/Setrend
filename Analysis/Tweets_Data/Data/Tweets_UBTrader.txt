UBTrader	725357418541101057	2016-04-27T16:14:19	Macroandchill idk either but curious to see how it plays out.
UBTrader	725351200724496385	2016-04-27T15:49:37	Macroandchill if it continues to play out like last year at this time it's got a lot further to go?

UBTrader	724954373898534912	2016-04-26T13:32:46	LongTplexTrader totally agree. This drift and grind the precursor to an extreme exaggerated move. Just hoping I catch some of it correctly.

UBTrader	724372213386907649	2016-04-24T22:59:28	UBTrader that epic day may 7 last year bunds had a 300 tick hi lo range that day.
UBTrader	724371728449806336	2016-04-24T22:57:32	Bunds been behaving a lot like last year in April at this time. Curious to see if a grind lower escalates into a crescendo like May 7, 2015?
UBTrader	722628228947537920	2016-04-20T03:29:30	IronFlies lol. Just sharing the useless info I saw scroll across CNBC earlier today in regards to peroni brand.

UBTrader	722622364920451072	2016-04-20T03:06:12	markberrytweets wish we had the TFSA here in US. Closest we have is Roth IRA but w/d b4 59 1/2 is limited to contributions only w/o fees.

UBTrader	721479618029596672	2016-04-16T23:25:20	Bernie Sanders tax rate of 13.5% is pathetic for a socialist like himself. Hypocrite. Pay 90% or higher so you can walk the walk correctly.
UBTrader	721475156556779520	2016-04-16T23:07:36	FadeTrader Japan's earthquakes been getting surprisingly little coverage on news. Any time I turned news on it's politics coverage. Sad.
UBTrader	721474431734964224	2016-04-16T23:04:43	Japan's earthquakes, Brazil's impeachment proceedings, and Doha meeting. Will Sunday night's open be out of control or just normal night????

UBTrader	720258403080224768	2016-04-13T14:32:39	It was Fri Apr 17 last year when bund yields hit their intraday low yields. Of course extreme reversal moves followed late Apr/early May.
UBTrader	720256310047088640	2016-04-13T14:24:20	CL shenanigans about to commence in a few minutes. Time to get the popcorn ahead of EIA.

UBTrader	719611933813563394	2016-04-11T19:43:49	Another interesting day in Tplex if that's what you want to call it. Walking away after the first few hours of the morning may be best.
UBTrader	719552749608767489	2016-04-11T15:48:38	Here we go Tplex.
UBTrader	719222261803323392	2016-04-10T17:55:24	DavidSchawel but another chance down here at these yields now to try a short again on bunds.

UBTrader	718491753838485504	2016-04-08T17:32:37	Looks like this will be the first week since Christmas and New Years weeks that ZN didn't do at least 1 mil contracts at least 1 day of week

UBTrader	717348250114789377	2016-04-05T13:48:45	I keep telling myself flat is a position too but it's not providing me comfort now looking at this Tplex rally.

UBTrader	717001417504997377	2016-04-04T14:50:33	Such a tricky market today ZB UB. Not a day to overstay your welcome imo.
UBTrader	716980315609284608	2016-04-04T13:26:42	MontyLaw I concur. Best to stay flat until we get a directional break. Tempting to take the bait a few times but remaining flat for now.
UBTrader	716978053709225985	2016-04-04T13:17:43	Couple head fakes already this morning ZB UB.

UBTrader	716454490694664192	2016-04-03T02:37:16	inner_scorecard etleggett no. Unfortunately they stayed on the sidelines all these years. Money market funds paying nothing. Pure fear
UBTrader	716453197477519360	2016-04-03T02:32:07	inner_scorecard etleggett exactly. Hight of dotcom days back then too so stocks were starting to get talked about "everywhere" back then.
UBTrader	716452967692570624	2016-04-03T02:31:13	etleggett yep they missed out on lots but that one hard early lesson kept them from participating since. Too gun shy all those years since.
UBTrader	716452664180125697	2016-04-03T02:30:00	inner_scorecard etleggett and made their first stock purchase and were feeling good about it for a few short weeks.
UBTrader	716452527324135424	2016-04-03T02:29:28	inner_scorecard etleggett honestly they didn't do their own due diligence and just blindly followed what was being touted and opened acct
UBTrader	716452348927860736	2016-04-03T02:28:45	inner_scorecard etleggett it was the "stock du jour" of the time at highs being pumped in financial media. They had zero experience and
UBTrader	716450591648690176	2016-04-03T02:21:46	etleggett lol. True story here. My sister and brother in law's first and only stock was buying Enron at highs. No stocks for them since.
UBTrader	716448894310285316	2016-04-03T02:15:02	These Final Four games lacking in drama so far. Barely paying attention to them.

UBTrader	715960925707218944	2016-04-01T17:56:01	LongTplexTrader you clawed back like a champ from that first neg PnL you posted. We've all been there before letting a bad trade get worse.
UBTrader	715957998414381056	2016-04-01T17:44:23	LongTplexTrader nice claw back today man. I know it was rough day for you/stressful. Going forward I'll be taking off NFP days myself.

UBTrader	715888863571537920	2016-04-01T13:09:40	LongTplexTrader I think 165-20 a possibility here.

UBTrader	712698104928075776	2016-03-23T17:50:44	govttrader you are not the only one. I took profits too soon in both ZN and UB today. Been a one way ride up and hard to get good re entry.
UBTrader	712643550626746369	2016-03-23T14:13:57	LongTplexTrader 08 to the tick so far. Curious if we bust through later. Nice call on the levels.
UBTrader	712630992159158272	2016-03-23T13:24:03	govttrader gotcha. Kind of confused me today given recent correlation.
UBTrader	712630262597701632	2016-03-23T13:21:09	Yen not playing with Tplex today?

UBTrader	712341672990904320	2016-03-22T18:14:24	GE490 yep same scenario here and just as confused.
UBTrader	712339145234886656	2016-03-22T18:04:21	UBTrader this move def woke me up in Tplex.
UBTrader	712319739444355072	2016-03-22T16:47:14	Tplex not moving at all. Zzzzzzz.
UBTrader	712047930123935745	2016-03-21T22:47:10	UBTrader and here it is albeit after Mon Globex close. So expected to get these prints down here mon during day session but got them now.

UBTrader	712017752769167360	2016-03-21T20:47:15	ZN held Thur lows of 129-000. Thought it would push a tad lower than that honestly but on low volume day not enough to get through it.
UBTrader	712015650441433090	2016-03-21T20:38:54	bondskew agreed def sucked after then
UBTrader	712006834811305985	2016-03-21T20:03:52	bondskew unfortunately I covered my short about 12-14 ticks too soon on my earlier UB short and I didn't catch the exact low.
UBTrader	712006553985884160	2016-03-21T20:02:45	bondskew I was talking specifically about UB as it hit LOD at 2:47 2:48  pm EST but ur right anemic volume and not enough force 4 all Tplex
UBTrader	712001422401736706	2016-03-21T19:42:22	bondskew nice call earlier. We got the new lows as you said. Took some patience to wait it out but paid off if one waited.
UBTrader	711978219570745344	2016-03-21T18:10:10	GE490 first day back from vacay always rough in trading imo or at least that first day back never been kind to me in the past either.
UBTrader	711974973716303876	2016-03-21T17:57:16	__i960 I remember that show Fame and that tune. Lol. Got that tune in my head now.
UBTrader	711973093338525698	2016-03-21T17:49:47	GE490 welcome back from vacay. Agreed unless one caught that early morning move lower in Treasuries it has been rough. Slow day after that.
UBTrader	711971019997622272	2016-03-21T17:41:33	__i960 fine by me. There is pain either way and one must choose which pain hurts less.
UBTrader	711970865215197185	2016-03-21T17:40:56	Been looking for ZN to take out LOD and at least get a 128-310 print and maybe lower.
UBTrader	711938046006931457	2016-03-21T15:30:31	Trading can be summed up by the following quote-"the pain of discipline or the pain of regret." Simple as that.

UBTrader	711937051449405440	2016-03-21T15:26:34	bondskew MontyLaw I agree lower later but just being patient for that perfect entry so hard after I missed the initial move down.
UBTrader	711936572476657664	2016-03-21T15:24:40	bondskew MontyLaw good strategy today. If missing the initial move down then it's been an exercise in patience today.
UBTrader	711936091822039040	2016-03-21T15:22:46	MontyLaw bondskew crazy thin. That was scary fast. Was just getting ready to attempt a short scalp before that move. Thank goodness not.
UBTrader	711934833358843904	2016-03-21T15:17:46	GE490 lol. That was quick and sudden.

UBTrader	699975188084092928	2016-02-17T15:14:24	IronFlies LongTplexTrader yeah I got this one way wrong. I thought ZB would climb back up to 168-00 first then make run down to 163-00.
UBTrader	699794281834377217	2016-02-17T03:15:32	LongTplexTrader I would be highly surprised to see it go significantly over 168-00 give or take a few tics. We will see.
UBTrader	699792845935349760	2016-02-17T03:09:50	LongTplexTrader I think it will take a few days for it all to play out obviously.

UBTrader	692511326166474752	2016-01-28T00:55:41	spz_trader FatF1nger ditto for me as well. Never had FB account. It's a small club of folks who haven't.
UBTrader	692432192539074560	2016-01-27T19:41:14	Bunds new high of day.
UBTrader	692344883365945344	2016-01-27T13:54:17	Econghost no doubt. Crazy to see selling in bunds.
UBTrader	692335314354962432	2016-01-27T13:16:16	What is this? Bunds down a tick? I'm not used to this.
UBTrader	692087552736628739	2016-01-26T20:51:45	RanchoDinero lmao. Agree.
UBTrader	692087422117617664	2016-01-26T20:51:14	RanchoDinero what no love for the Australian band Air Supply?
UBTrader	692043461994876929	2016-01-26T17:56:33	ag_trader FadeTrader how long before bund yields less than JGBs again?
UBTrader	692040810800488449	2016-01-26T17:46:01	hayitsDavey agreed. Was short early am and covered. Been sitting on my hands since.
UBTrader	692039542879195136	2016-01-26T17:40:59	7573bob gotcha. Time frames don't matter as long as one is profitable on their chosen timeframe/risk tolerance in my opinion.
UBTrader	692038521838813185	2016-01-26T17:36:55	moodilka one would think but hard to say. I don't trade ES. Too hot to handle for me. I stick with ZN ZB UB and occasionally bund only.
UBTrader	692037789857288194	2016-01-26T17:34:01	7573bob don't know.I'm flat right now just observing.I mainly trade intraday so projections/speculation beyond 24 hours above my pay grade.
UBTrader	692036184575479808	2016-01-26T17:27:38	InterestArb a head scratcher for sure. My fragile little brain hurts.
UBTrader	692034818629066752	2016-01-26T17:22:12	ZN ZB UB don't care what ES and CL doing. Tough trade in Tplex if you are watching CL ES. The afternoon might get weird in treasuries.
UBTrader	690615789460819970	2016-01-22T19:23:29	InterestArb LongTplexTrader weird price action for sure given oil and equity action.
UBTrader	690610695956774913	2016-01-22T19:03:15	bmiller22 I forgot the exact percentages but each buzz word had a percentage increase associated with it.
UBTrader	690610484417073153	2016-01-22T19:02:25	bmiller22 agreed. I read an article one time about the amount of costs an avg consumer will pay extra 4 if those words are on a product.
UBTrader	690609618532372480	2016-01-22T18:58:58	bmiller22 to be found in the quinoa, kale, gluten free non GMO artisanal aisles soon.
UBTrader	690608746033221632	2016-01-22T18:55:30	jay_harring I was noticing that as well. With oil at new HOD seems like bonds would have broken just a little bit lower but bonds steadynow
UBTrader	690539641494183941	2016-01-22T14:20:54	What was that oil? Wow.
UBTrader	690539505170907136	2016-01-22T14:20:22	Oil
UBTrader	690023974386933760	2016-01-21T04:11:50	Mike_Ocsbig agree
UBTrader	690005241320861697	2016-01-21T02:57:23	But then again a capitulation day is like porn-I'll know it when I see it.
UBTrader	690005064325427201	2016-01-21T02:56:41	We've become desensitized to large moves. Today ES down 60 plus handles at one point and still the selling was orderly. Capitulation-150 ES?
UBTrader	689978935183085569	2016-01-21T01:12:51	The nightly fix in a few.  China currency fix that is.
UBTrader	689908488680685569	2016-01-20T20:32:56	InterestArb it would be but doubt it happens.
UBTrader	689907834889375744	2016-01-20T20:30:20	tweetstar10 nice call earlier.
UBTrader	689907618693943296	2016-01-20T20:29:28	InterestArb somebody made some money today with that. Sure wasn't me.
UBTrader	689907257836969984	2016-01-20T20:28:02	Kudos to you ES traders that bought at the bottom today and still holding. Bravo. Well done.
UBTrader	689905716715507712	2016-01-20T20:21:55	Hero_Hedge yep. Totally insane day.
UBTrader	689905476247646209	2016-01-20T20:20:58	Hero_Hedge looking that way
UBTrader	689902047886512128	2016-01-20T20:07:20	bmiller22 several
UBTrader	689901706755346433	2016-01-20T20:05:59	hayitsDavey lmao. I thought I was doing good today because I only lost 10% of what I lost yesterday. Smaller losses. The new winning!!!!!!!
UBTrader	689898918851821569	2016-01-20T19:54:54	Trader_Dante nervous pee jokes prior to ECB or not?
UBTrader	689898671027126272	2016-01-20T19:53:55	Trader_Dante tell a new trader they are still on a demo but secretly they are really live and you wait to tell them after a month. It works
UBTrader	689862481343291392	2016-01-20T17:30:07	GE490 there are many trust me.
UBTrader	689858120932331522	2016-01-20T17:12:47	UBTrader covered at 129-030 for a couple tick loss.
UBTrader	689857952329646080	2016-01-20T17:12:07	drveen I just covered at '030 for a 2 tick loss.
UBTrader	689852248046829568	2016-01-20T16:49:27	drveen agreed
UBTrader	689848069895102465	2016-01-20T16:32:51	drveen I'm thinking we get a little buying action in ES off here so I'm trying for a decent sized move down in ZN. We will see?
UBTrader	689842706466611204	2016-01-20T16:11:32	Short ZN at 129-010. Dipping my toes in the water. Yes I usually trade UB ZB but shorting up here going to do it with ZN on a day like this.
UBTrader	689837171382034432	2016-01-20T15:49:32	LongTplexTrader totally agree
UBTrader	689835938944552961	2016-01-20T15:44:39	Is it too late to do some of those after the fact hedging trades I see advertised? Asking for a friend and myself.
UBTrader	689766884787539972	2016-01-20T11:10:15	etleggett totally nuts. Expect we will see some more fireworks during the day session here.
UBTrader	689764280753885184	2016-01-20T10:59:54	Looks like the overnight trade was the trade again.

UBTrader	689548063262769153	2016-01-19T20:40:44	Not going to lie. I got my butt royally kicked in the markets today. My own fault though. It's ok I'll be back to take a shot tomorrow.

UBTrader	688071172123148288	2016-01-15T18:52:05	Kind of thought bonds would have pushed harder higher by now. Thoughts of that late afternoon push down in bonds on Wed weighs on my mind???

UBTrader	686974332564811776	2016-01-12T18:13:38	Ok I admit I got no business commenting on oil. I trade bonds only. All I know is I have to watch oil to trade bonds these days.
UBTrader	686972975145422850	2016-01-12T18:08:15	@Mindsetrisk agreed. Hit into em with 70 or less and it folds like a cheap suit.
UBTrader	686972174217965569	2016-01-12T18:05:04	Never seen Tplex traders be so quiet going into auction like we just had on 3 yr note auction. CL is at the front of everyone's minds now.
UBTrader	686962261521489920	2016-01-12T17:25:40	@GalacticMacro don't leave the screen. Too dangerous. You may miss it.
UBTrader	686961977713913856	2016-01-12T17:24:33	S0123456789123 no more Asia sessions for me. A week and a half into the new year and I'm already exhausted.
UBTrader	686960754109579264	2016-01-12T17:19:41	Let's do this now oil. Get it over with. A massive swoosh down then catching a late afternoon short covering bid higher.
UBTrader	686958412178010112	2016-01-12T17:10:23	MontyLaw unfortunately health care premiums eating away at all my gas savings so no real net benefit for me. My anecdotal take only.
UBTrader	686958155633393666	2016-01-12T17:09:22	MontyLaw lmao. I could fill up my tank for free and I would still be net negative each month due to higher insurance monthly premiums etc..
UBTrader	686956587735494656	2016-01-12T17:03:08	MontyLaw yes all about the timing. In the meantime I feel hostage to this oil move before I can get comfortable with a short in UB.
UBTrader	686955855938514944	2016-01-12T17:00:13	MontyLaw I'm looking to get short but waiting for higher if I can get it. We will see.
UBTrader	686955537787973633	2016-01-12T16:58:57	spz_trader agree.
UBTrader	686954234064011264	2016-01-12T16:53:47	Everyone on twitter will be disappointed now it seems if we don't get some kind of $29 something print in oil today.
UBTrader	686953701337108481	2016-01-12T16:51:40	BHN34 LongTplexTrader I too was hoping for it today but I'll take it tomorrow or Thur.
UBTrader	686953467152318464	2016-01-12T16:50:44	BHN34 LongTplexTrader yep. I do think this sets up for a monster short in the next day or so in long end with supply a cometh.
UBTrader	686951203893293056	2016-01-12T16:41:44	BHN34 LongTplexTrader and I only brought my bare hands no weapon at all to this madness.

UBTrader	686923657378197505	2016-01-12T14:52:17	TeaSpreader yes this back and forth action in bonds frustrating. We will see how the day unfolds from here.
UBTrader	686916081580163073	2016-01-12T14:22:10	One of these days we will get a sustained direction in bonds without the whipsaws. Thought maybe today would happen with oil and spoos bid??
UBTrader	686915462765113345	2016-01-12T14:19:43	GE490 true
UBTrader	686911106640666624	2016-01-12T14:02:24	That was a nasty reversal in bonds off the lows. I think we retest lows later but it wants to your patience first. Need bunds to take dive2.
UBTrader	686722790913871872	2016-01-12T01:34:06	etleggett deep thoughts I like it.

UBTrader	686622359508414464	2016-01-11T18:55:01	Crude oil and synonyms for carnage are: massacre, annihilation, blood bath, havoc, extermination, and destroy just to name a few.

UBTrader	684928627385970688	2016-01-07T02:44:44	FadeTrader your emoji game has been on point lately.
UBTrader	684829552351297537	2016-01-06T20:11:03	ACTFutures at this point in the day though just thinking I'd rather go home flat tonight and reassess first thing in morning.
UBTrader	684828576374484992	2016-01-06T20:07:10	ACTFutures I was thinking of a short but was wanting to try to get short at around 155-25. Not sure if it gets there today.

UBTrader	684457539593990145	2016-01-05T19:32:48	Hero_Hedge think this is a sign imo. Nasty selloff in ZB UB in the next day or so pre NFP.
UBTrader	684457350640566273	2016-01-05T19:32:03	Hero_Hedge not sure except ES mini ramp up and flattening earlier today. Also yesterday long end had quite the pullback given ES carnage.
UBTrader	684456013865553920	2016-01-05T19:26:44	Long end smacked back down.
UBTrader	684414135950536704	2016-01-05T16:40:20	LongTplexTrader how is that possible? Slow news day?
UBTrader	684388709500850178	2016-01-05T14:59:18	Bonds getting whippy again. Hands off mouse. Don't want to get caught off guard here.
UBTrader	684387561637294080	2016-01-05T14:54:44	LongTplexTrader bunds not cooperating here with long end.
UBTrader	684387419089711104	2016-01-05T14:54:10	Copernicus2013 certainly caused a little confusion earlier(for me at least).
UBTrader	684377752431104000	2016-01-05T14:15:45	MarcoMNYC that would be nice
UBTrader	684376038231666688	2016-01-05T14:08:57	drveen yes sir
UBTrader	684375624182546432	2016-01-05T14:07:18	I trade mainly UB ZB  but feel I spend most of my time watching bunds and oil.
UBTrader	684375383941214208	2016-01-05T14:06:21	With bunds bid feels like it's going to be hard for long end to sustain sell offs. Oil not helping long end shorts here either.
UBTrader	683987538390958080	2016-01-04T12:25:11	@ReversalTrend lmao. That's hilarious.
