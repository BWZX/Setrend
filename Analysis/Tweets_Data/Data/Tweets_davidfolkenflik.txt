davidfolkenflik	714085333663629312	2016-03-27T13:43:05	12/ but you can't see record ratings and record clicks around political coverage and say media is irrelevant here. It's not.
davidfolkenflik	714085008315703300	2016-03-27T13:41:47	11/ That holds for before this campaign too
davidfolkenflik	714084903298719745	2016-03-27T13:41:22	10/ To say media "created" Trump misses the mark. He's a self-created animal of the media - which has happily feasted on his spectacle

davidfolkenflik	714082933166964736	2016-03-27T13:33:32	6/ I also think those expecting news organizations to "stop Trump" misunderstand how most news orgs are configured and view themselves
davidfolkenflik	714082564743540736	2016-03-27T13:32:05	5/ "media" obviously too unwieldy a category to lump all together - cable TV in particular susceptible to reacting to Trump outrage du jour
davidfolkenflik	714081850235478016	2016-03-27T13:29:14	4/ ... Media helped enable DT rise with often blanket coverage that typically reactive and as a result generally insubstantial.
davidfolkenflik	714081280451874817	2016-03-27T13:26:58	3/ I think it's too binary... media largely missed legitimate story of his rise and also helped enable it....
