TheBubbleBubble	715987277252575233	2016-04-01T19:40:43	It's beyond a false choice - it's an oxymoron. Corruption can only exist when the state has intervention to sell.

TheBubbleBubble	715987551006408704	2016-04-01T19:41:49	Exactly. As instapundit says, the problem with limited/small govt is there's insufficient opportunity for graft 
TheBubbleBubble	715986316626956289	2016-04-01T19:36:54	"End the corruption and graft...but you have to have socialism." No, that's a false choice.

TheBubbleBubble	715980250816102400	2016-04-01T19:12:48	.TomSiebert That's what's deceiving so many people into supporting the socialist side of him.
TheBubbleBubble	715979633393606656	2016-04-01T19:10:21	TheBubbleBubble - So there are elements of what he says that appeal to me. Plus he's fundamental less dishonest than anyone other candidate
TheBubbleBubble	715978693756198912	2016-04-01T19:06:37	.TomSiebert And I agree with him on that (it's common sense), but his socialist ideas are flat out garbage.

TheBubbleBubble	715975922315313153	2016-04-01T18:55:36	.MusashiDesigns For the millionth time I've said this, that is NOT capitalism. We have Bubble Capitalism thanks to central banking.

TheBubbleBubble	715974515822632960	2016-04-01T18:50:01	The problem is that the Bernie supporters don't believe in hustling. They want "the man" (IRS) to steal for them: 
TheBubbleBubble	715973769211281408	2016-04-01T18:47:03	My parents never handed me money or paid for my college. I graduated into a huge crisis, but I hustled and things are really looking up.

TheBubbleBubble	715907171226161153	2016-04-01T14:22:25	Qsidewater True - I need one.
TheBubbleBubble	715907065395474432	2016-04-01T14:21:59	laokoon2 Thank you!
TheBubbleBubble	715907016313737216	2016-04-01T14:21:48	ebenbayer Working toward that.
TheBubbleBubble	715890137830449152	2016-04-01T13:14:44	LawrencePerspec I agree

TheBubbleBubble	715887499432869888	2016-04-01T13:04:15	TomTheProducer1 I like that.
TheBubbleBubble	715887015204675584	2016-04-01T13:02:19	kcbill That's just one part of it.

TheBubbleBubble	715886037617221632	2016-04-01T12:58:26	JeffLee2020 Same here...but I don't post pictures of those because I live in a communist state ;)
TheBubbleBubble	715885648503287809	2016-04-01T12:56:53	kcbill Basically, get your preps taken care of first before thinking about extravagances.
TheBubbleBubble	715885486833852417	2016-04-01T12:56:15	Blazing_Ben But in what regards? Body deterioration? State of mind?
TheBubbleBubble	715885190741168128	2016-04-01T12:55:04	JPrice02 It's a noble cause, but I literally don't have the time to write much more these days...
TheBubbleBubble	715885067193753600	2016-04-01T12:54:35	Blazing_Ben Why do you say that?
TheBubbleBubble	715884911757037569	2016-04-01T12:53:58	I'm a genuine prepper. I wouldn't even think about luxuries until you are prepared for what's ahead. Don't put the cart before the horse.
TheBubbleBubble	715884098074644481	2016-04-01T12:50:44	Turning 30 has been a huge wake-up call for me. I was always about prudence, planning, etc...but I realize that I never really LIVED.
TheBubbleBubble	715883102841790465	2016-04-01T12:46:46	.@roguewail Don't worry - I have all that covered. But you also have to live in the present, which is something I've been learning lately.
TheBubbleBubble	715879912637407232	2016-04-01T12:34:06	kumararepublic I agree - that's why you should get one that is ~2 years old so that you have less depreciation. sdesai777
TheBubbleBubble	715878324820701184	2016-04-01T12:27:47	JeffLee2020 It's very possible if history is any indication. sdesai777
TheBubbleBubble	715877774465056768	2016-04-01T12:25:36	.JeffLee2020 That's exactly my point. Don't pay inflated prices for luxuries today when you can buy them cheaper later. sdesai777

TheBubbleBubble	715875164257435648	2016-04-01T12:15:14	.sdesai777 "should have got Porsche." Sure...but after the bubbles pop. Why go all out now when you can get tremendous bargains later?
TheBubbleBubble	715856648494047232	2016-04-01T11:01:39	TheBubbleBubble should have got Porsche. There is no substitute
TheBubbleBubble	715873596695003136	2016-04-01T12:09:00	Biotravis Meh - the Tesla is too quiet. It has no soul.
TheBubbleBubble	715768000037724161	2016-04-01T05:09:24	HorseInRain why shouldn't people strive for an exciting life? A normal life is boring.
TheBubbleBubble	715752591033024512	2016-04-01T04:08:10	nosyass I've lived both ways...and the drab, plain lifestyle is boring as hell. I crave elegance in my life.
TheBubbleBubble	715751730009546752	2016-04-01T04:04:45	nosyass There's nothing wrong with nice things. I'm a capitalist. I have a problem w/how our culture ONLY values material over intellect.
TheBubbleBubble	715751181922992129	2016-04-01T04:02:34	colkt Ok - thank you :)
TheBubbleBubble	715744580122054656	2016-04-01T03:36:20	colkt Nothing wrong with it if a person is authentic. I'm just referring to people who try to be "hip" and cool by using terms like that.
TheBubbleBubble	715744375658168321	2016-04-01T03:35:31	colkt That they try to be neo-hippies and take bits of different religions and philosophies. Basically, that they are a stereotype.
TheBubbleBubble	715743741789736961	2016-04-01T03:33:00	v_a_saxena No, not at all. I have many great Indian friends and I respect the culture. Hipsters on the other hand ;)
TheBubbleBubble	715743107577462784	2016-04-01T03:30:29	colkt I'm just not a fan of hipsters...haha
TheBubbleBubble	715742937158709249	2016-04-01T03:29:48	colkt Sure: I respect the actual meaning behind the word; I'm just referring to the cliche of U.S. hipsters who use that.
TheBubbleBubble	715742019608584193	2016-04-01T03:26:09	beastumfan I like both, but happened to get a very good deal that I couldn't refuse.

TheBubbleBubble	715585949896425472	2016-03-31T17:06:00	AsianFusionGirl For now. I don't want to live in NYC at this point (it's completely bubbled up).
TheBubbleBubble	715584850074402821	2016-03-31T17:01:37	india_jain Well said

TheBubbleBubble	715584632427843584	2016-03-31T17:00:45	hardassettimes Ugh
TheBubbleBubble	715582586085617664	2016-03-31T16:52:38	hardassettimes I believe it...at least until the next QE.
TheBubbleBubble	715582527109472256	2016-03-31T16:52:24	AsianFusionGirl Yes, so true. It's very possible to spend years if not an entire lifetime in isolation.
TheBubbleBubble	715581935976902656	2016-03-31T16:50:03	JoeyTimlin Exactly - so many people live depressed, empty lives.
TheBubbleBubble	715581840673939457	2016-03-31T16:49:40	AsianFusionGirl Very true. It helps to be surrounded by people who support you and have similar values.

TheBubbleBubble	715579033245757440	2016-03-31T16:38:30	TheBubbleBubble my father n law was CEO of a very large privately held company. His favorite saying "bullshit baffles brains".

TheBubbleBubble	715568785579761664	2016-03-31T15:57:47	TheBubbleBubble like I've said, we're judged on our appearance.
TheBubbleBubble	715568997220163584	2016-03-31T15:58:38	Sure, you can be a rebel, but then you will become completely isolated from the culture. It's a tough choice.

TheBubbleBubble	715566882674356227	2016-03-31T15:50:14	We live in such a fake culture that you actually have to adapt to it somewhat to survive, even if you're not a true believer.

TheBubbleBubble	715563538299949057	2016-03-31T15:36:56	.MishoMoney I agree w/you, but being an intellectual counts as points against you in this culture (I say this from decades of experiences).

TheBubbleBubble	715261759611912198	2016-03-30T19:37:47	GabrielDVine What makes you think that they're mutually exclusive? That's very simplistic ("either you have one OR the other") Not true!
TheBubbleBubble	715259612832866307	2016-03-30T19:29:15	Being a striver isn't considered cool now because that's emblematic of capitalism, which millennials hate (see the FeelTheBern movement).
TheBubbleBubble	715259390408962049	2016-03-30T19:28:22	GabrielDVine Yeah, so everything is swell in this world...NOT
TheBubbleBubble	715257291377868800	2016-03-30T19:20:01	Why do I discuss today's culture/society and my personal experience? Because they're inextricably interlinked with our economy.
TheBubbleBubble	715256646553976832	2016-03-30T19:17:28	Just like we have a completely fake economy, we also have a fake culture. It goes hand-in-hand, I guess.
TheBubbleBubble	715254341888815104	2016-03-30T19:08:18	Because so many millennials are flat broke (not even $100 to their names), the hipster/hobo lifestyle is chic. I'm the antithesis of that.
TheBubbleBubble	715253251147476994	2016-03-30T19:03:58	Obviously, intellect isn't respected in this culture (as I learned junior high), so I learned to develop other areas too. Doesn't matter.
TheBubbleBubble	715252811026530304	2016-03-30T19:02:13	I am really, really growing to hate this generation. I just can't handle the dysfunction anymore. There really is something wrong here.

TheBubbleBubble	715251599061475328	2016-03-30T18:57:24	Actually, I would do much better if I carried myself like a hobo...because that's the millennial style now (which I detest with a passion)!
TheBubbleBubble	715250831189221376	2016-03-30T18:54:21	And I don't exactly look or carry myself like a hobo. None of that matters now...

TheBubbleBubble	706201335335620609	2016-03-05T19:34:53	It is erroneous to consider housing as a hard asset, like many people do, because it ignores the massive debt that is supporting prices.
TheBubbleBubble	706200912268816385	2016-03-05T19:33:12	I don't like housing as a investment right now, however. It's an overvalued market inflated by a long-term mortgage bubble (in many areas).

TheBubbleBubble	706189600243339264	2016-03-05T18:48:15	incantevoleeee It isn't necessarily a bubble itself, but b/c much of society's wealth is inflated, it creates artificial buying power.

TheBubbleBubble	706183354111172608	2016-03-05T18:23:26	Even selective cosmetic procedures (nothing radical) can be of value for some people. Facials, chemical peels, photofacials, eye lift, etc.
TheBubbleBubble	706182110298689536	2016-03-05T18:18:29	Wearing quality, well-fitted clothes and shoes makes you feel more confident and taken more seriously, which can translate to higher income.

TheBubbleBubble	706174281030496256	2016-03-05T17:47:23	I do believe in "selective extravagances" though. Nice clothes &amp; shoes, nice watch, a sporty car, eating out often, are worth it to me.

TheBubbleBubble	704804638760050688	2016-03-01T23:04:55	MichalakisCon Ok, so econ views are only valid from the 50 and up crowd? After all, they've been such great stewards of our economy.

TheBubbleBubble	704803763802996736	2016-03-01T23:01:26	MichalakisCon Let me guess: you wouldn't be debating me if I said "buy stawks and real estate...they go up!"
TheBubbleBubble	704803502397243396	2016-03-01T23:00:24	MichalakisCon Yeah, I'm also the dude who warned about the EM crisis:  &amp; oil:  Did you?
TheBubbleBubble	704801108099727360	2016-03-01T22:50:53	MichalakisCon Yup...Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were "kids" when they ate IBM's lunch in the 1980s.
TheBubbleBubble	704800939610382336	2016-03-01T22:50:13	MichalakisCon No, I warned about the financial crisis on a large scale as a college student. I also watched the 2001 crash closely.

TheBubbleBubble	704797607219044353	2016-03-01T22:36:58	MichalakisCon I'm just saying when they reach extremes in collective positioning. It's not a commentary on individual CTAs. See my article.
TheBubbleBubble	704796864038703104	2016-03-01T22:34:01	MichalakisCon They are...when they reach extreme points. I explained it here: 
TheBubbleBubble	704796699315855361	2016-03-01T22:33:22	MichalakisCon I'm a private investor for now. I want to start a value fund after the bubbles pop.
TheBubbleBubble	704796280493576195	2016-03-01T22:31:42	MichalakisCon Mostly trend-following CTAs. Hedgers are the oil producers and users (they mostly do the opposite of the specs).

TheBubbleBubble	704722272825819136	2016-03-01T17:37:37	lynn0p Good point
TheBubbleBubble	704722228705935360	2016-03-01T17:37:27	.CMIDavid I respectfully disagree. In June 2014, I showed that the dumb money was bullish, smart money bearish: 
TheBubbleBubble	704721864443060224	2016-03-01T17:36:00	TheBubbleBubble Just remember that the "smart money" was long oil in the summer of 2014...
TheBubbleBubble	704721265383366657	2016-03-01T17:33:37	Similarly, I cannot get excited about an oil bottom while the smart money is still short. Common sense. USO WTI 
TheBubbleBubble	704720306552889345	2016-03-01T17:29:48	So, this stock/risk asset bounce is predicated on a so-called crude oil bottom when there hasn't even been a capitulation? Good luck w/that.
TheBubbleBubble	704719106642018304	2016-03-01T17:25:02	TheBubbleBubble Agreed.  I think there needs to be a complete scary washout and by all rights that event should still be coming.

TheBubbleBubble	703628765042241536	2016-02-27T17:12:25	.modern_rock Read my article to see how I can both warn about bubbles AND stay on the right side of the market: 
TheBubbleBubble	703628521000865792	2016-02-27T17:11:26	.modern_rock I explained in detail years ago that we were on the verge of a bubble-driven bull market: 
TheBubbleBubble	703625568655273985	2016-02-27T16:59:42	TheBubbleBubble from when you grad in 2008 to now the mkts went on a crazy bull run almost doubling. But u been warning all that time too?
TheBubbleBubble	703623154737008642	2016-02-27T16:50:07	The vast majority of mainstream media journalists do not have their own online presence, following, and traffic that I personally have.
TheBubbleBubble	703622304572514307	2016-02-27T16:46:44	Not only do I have a very large following, but I'm getting these bubble warnings right (it's only getting started). This is my frustration.
TheBubbleBubble	703620513256644609	2016-02-27T16:39:37	There's this strange dichotomy where I have a huge online following, traffic, etc., but it is being ignored by the mainstream media.
TheBubbleBubble	703619778053804032	2016-02-27T16:36:42	I'm not ashamed to say that I want much more media attention...not for my own ego, but to raise awareness for this cause! Is that crazy?
TheBubbleBubble	703619415489822720	2016-02-27T16:35:15	The mainstream media has ignored the message of economic skeptics like myself, so we have to bypass them with non-traditional PR/media.
TheBubbleBubble	703618767671189504	2016-02-27T16:32:41	My SEO skills have allowed me to rank at the top of Google &amp; other search engines for my important keywords: 
TheBubbleBubble	703616963910701056	2016-02-27T16:25:31	I'm basically a "multipreneur" and private investor. I am always looking to grow, build new businesses/income streams, consulting, etc.
TheBubbleBubble	703616263986274305	2016-02-27T16:22:44	I am also paid for writing my Forbes column and receive residuals from that. I'm also planning to write ebooks, and much, much more.
TheBubbleBubble	703615832233025541	2016-02-27T16:21:01	So, I actually do "work" outside of warning about bubbles. I've also built up residual online income streams, trade the markets, etc.
TheBubbleBubble	703615430229946368	2016-02-27T16:19:25	I used my web marketing skills to build awareness for causes I believe in (bubbles), but it has also allowed me to make a nice living.
TheBubbleBubble	703615126004486145	2016-02-27T16:18:13	In addition to my finance/econ studies, I became a skilled web marketer (branding, SEO, social media, etc.). I did this throughout college.
TheBubbleBubble	703614706821500933	2016-02-27T16:16:33	I didn't believe in the long-term viability of Wall Street and mainstream financial careers - and I still don't. I wanted an alternative.
TheBubbleBubble	703614524956483584	2016-02-27T16:15:49	I graduated college in 2008 into the economic crisis (that I warned about). For a few years, I was confused &amp; was skeptical of Wall St.
TheBubbleBubble	703614203567935489	2016-02-27T16:14:33	Many people ask how I make a living outside of warning about bubbles. I tend to be private (for now), but I think it's important to explain.

TheBubbleBubble	703606760272228352	2016-02-27T15:44:58	One of the issues is that many alternative investments/crisis hedges tend to be illiquid.
TheBubbleBubble	703606467031605249	2016-02-27T15:43:48	I'm a big fan of alternative investments outside of the typical stocks, bonds, etc. I'm always looking for alternatives, even if exotic.

TheBubbleBubble	700330786898055168	2016-02-18T14:47:25	Agreed. Markets back to overbought and continue to build a downtrend. ShortCovering rallies are not bullish.
