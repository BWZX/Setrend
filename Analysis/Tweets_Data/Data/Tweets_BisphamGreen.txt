BisphamGreen	712386091526070272	2016-03-22T21:10:54	Manu_CB BTabrum agree. They could do a better job of managing perceptions though

BisphamGreen	712265035624673280	2016-03-22T13:09:52	Manu_CB BTabrum the [unrealised] profit on FX reserves is not and i presume cannot be transferred
BisphamGreen	712261223233011713	2016-03-22T12:54:43	BTabrum Manu_CB but the net debt / GDP figures are (I think) not adjusted for the FX swap stock
BisphamGreen	712260803764867072	2016-03-22T12:53:03	BTabrum Manu_CB however, the gain on FX assets does show up in the net debt / GDP figures
BisphamGreen	712260512273174528	2016-03-22T12:51:53	BTabrum Manu_CB yes. The swaps are reflected in the deficit, but as we were discussing yesterday, the gain on FX assets is not
BisphamGreen	712260320241254400	2016-03-22T12:51:08	BTabrum Manu_CB since 2013, FX depreciation has reduced net debt / GDP by about 9.5pp.
BisphamGreen	712259863729053696	2016-03-22T12:49:19	BTabrum Manu_CB I worked this out. The do recognise gain from FX depreciation but through balance sheet, not fiscal accounts
BisphamGreen	712256410738884608	2016-03-22T12:35:36	BTabrum Manu_CB just looked at the figures. Both FX reserves and BNDES (+others) are in there subtracting 24.8% and 9.4% GDP respectively
BisphamGreen	712040298138968070	2016-03-21T22:16:50	barnejek macrokurd boes_ makes you wonder what the historically derived probabilities are for any given year / 2 year / 3 year period
BisphamGreen	712036990179516416	2016-03-21T22:03:42	Manu_CB BTabrum regardless, I think we all agree about Brazil
BisphamGreen	712032642980560896	2016-03-21T21:46:25	Manu_CB BTabrum from memory Hungary had/has reserves/GDP at least 30%. I guess sterilisation cost a little less
BisphamGreen	712029780154179585	2016-03-21T21:35:03	BTabrum although somewhere like Hungary should look into using it. Govt debt net of FX reserves would look a lot healthier
BisphamGreen	712029377106735104	2016-03-21T21:33:27	BTabrum nope. I guess the most mentioned FX reserves are those of China wrt bank recapitalisation
BisphamGreen	712018347974590464	2016-03-21T20:49:37	Manu_CB BTabrum ericbeebo I blame bbg quoting the statistic
BisphamGreen	712016188730171392	2016-03-21T20:41:02	BTabrum Manu_CB ericbeebo ha. But seriously, who nets govt debt with FX reserves?
BisphamGreen	712015567671189504	2016-03-21T20:38:34	BTabrum Manu_CB ericbeebo but even so, I don't like netting with FX reserves. Reserves are owned by the country, not the govt
BisphamGreen	712015257347223553	2016-03-21T20:37:20	BTabrum Manu_CB ericbeebo hmm. OK. I thought it was net of govt lending
BisphamGreen	712014806417592320	2016-03-21T20:35:33	BTabrum BisphamGreen Manu_CB ericbeebo no the govt debt numbers which are net of Caixa et al
BisphamGreen	712014429844537344	2016-03-21T20:34:03	Manu_CB BTabrum ericbeebo and of course the laughable "net debt" statistic
BisphamGreen	712013389040656384	2016-03-21T20:29:55	Manu_CB BTabrum ericbeebo as ever with these things it depends on which gives the most the most horrific result
BisphamGreen	712005748952272896	2016-03-21T19:59:33	BTabrum Manu_CB ericbeebo totally agree. It might seem a conservative accounting method but they are shooting themselves in the foot
BisphamGreen	712004757792104450	2016-03-21T19:55:37	BTabrum Manu_CB ericbeebo except they don't (but maybe should) recognise the [larger] gain on the (much larger) stock of FX reserves
BisphamGreen	712003671798771712	2016-03-21T19:51:18	BTabrum Manu_CB ericbeebo fiscally, increasing (not reducing) swaps is good as it offsets negative carry of FX reserve sterilisation
BisphamGreen	711996725490294784	2016-03-21T19:23:42	Manu_CB ericbeebo BTabrum would imagine they reduce roll further as USDBRL declines further. Imagine they definitely don't want it &lt; 3
BisphamGreen	711992647167188993	2016-03-21T19:07:29	Manu_CB ericbeebo BTabrum they've used it before in periods of BRL strength over the past 2-3 years. Passively letting swaps roll off
BisphamGreen	711986788986986496	2016-03-21T18:44:13	deadlyfrom80yds fxmacro I think they try to cover as many bases as possible. Allows them to change view without being "wrong"

BisphamGreen	711979684330917888	2016-03-21T18:15:59	joshuademasi fair. My point was more that the headline is not dovish
BisphamGreen	711979115314868226	2016-03-21T18:13:43	This is consistent with tightening in April. Wage growth acceleration would require something rather more drastic  
BisphamGreen	711972158059241473	2016-03-21T17:46:04	Manu_CB depends if they can find a sponsor to take a chunk I guess

BisphamGreen	692306898918449152	2016-01-27T11:23:21	FadeTrader yeah not great but not disastrous either. And 2% probably pretty close to potential
BisphamGreen	692300234312015872	2016-01-27T10:56:52	FadeTrader trouble is interest rate sensitive parts of the US economy are doing just fine. Not a lot the Fed can do about exports or oil

BisphamGreen	688292545395200002	2016-01-16T09:31:45	Manu_CB for me, monetary loosening in Brazil is only appropriate if they also stop TJLP-linked lending. Until then it is not tight enough

BisphamGreen	688284698867466241	2016-01-16T09:00:34	Manu_CB Emergingtrends yup. France and Germany have insolvent state pension systems, so EU encourages everyone else to have the same
BisphamGreen	688284378418446336	2016-01-16T08:59:18	Manu_CB there will be more. Just saying that we can't expect "emergency" hikes in response to latest volatility

BisphamGreen	688280597479862272	2016-01-16T08:44:16	BisphamGreen inflation and hikes will come, but after the event
BisphamGreen	688280040090415105	2016-01-16T08:42:03	BisphamGreen thus i doubt many authorities will stand in the way. for now, EMFX will all be about the broader market risk-off and recovery
BisphamGreen	688276712363298816	2016-01-16T08:28:50	Emergingtrends it's a great example of the value of the relationship with rating agencies vs actual fundamentals. SA knows this well
BisphamGreen	688276294732099584	2016-01-16T08:27:10	BisphamGreen  especially as inflation is low and after almost 5 years of depreciation, the marginal cost of more is probably close to zero
BisphamGreen	688275616190185472	2016-01-16T08:24:29	BisphamGreen fighting depreciation through intervention or hikes is costly and probably counterproductive and even ineffective
BisphamGreen	688274963711836160	2016-01-16T08:21:53	BisphamGreen in most EM, allowing FX depreciation within acceptable financial stability limits has been the best/only response
BisphamGreen	688272424400334848	2016-01-16T08:11:48	BisphamGreen like in January 2014, US monetary policy is a factor but this time commodities/growth concerns loom large

BisphamGreen	688070574657155072	2016-01-15T18:49:43	For all the "it's 2008!" comparisons, this actually feels like Q1 2009 when the market just went down every day. So depressing

BisphamGreen	688039959949930496	2016-01-15T16:48:04	Manu_CB it all feels like a massive overreaction. And fuels anti-EU sentiment

BisphamGreen	683666369011953664	2016-01-03T15:08:58	BaldingsWorld yes I understand. I guess my main view is that China isn't losing its exporting edge
BisphamGreen	683646564758335491	2016-01-03T13:50:17	BaldingsWorld Fair enough, but I guess the fact that this is market share rather than value shows China still v competitive
