_BenWright_	725502108355665922	2016-04-28T01:49:16	Confused by Brexit? Here’s why voting Remain is the sensible option… for now: My column in telebusiness 
_BenWright_	723937961084071936	2016-04-23T18:13:54	British_Airways But if I don't I definitely miss meeting it's taken two months to arrange. What would you do?
_BenWright_	723937755982626820	2016-04-23T18:13:05	British_Airways Kicker is: if I take Air China and (probably) miss meeting, there's no recourse b/c technically you got me there.
_BenWright_	723937344626282497	2016-04-23T18:11:27	British_Airways Given choice b/ween Air China flight lands hour b4 meeting or BA flight 2morrow that lands after interviewee leaves country
_BenWright_	723929902546821122	2016-04-23T17:41:53	Hi British_Airways After waiting 4 hrs I HAVE been bumped off flight. Still curious how reading T&amp;Cs would have helped. Enjoy rest of w/e.
_BenWright_	723914148925562880	2016-04-23T16:39:17	.British_Airways Ok, mea culpa, didn't read T&amp;Cs. But I would have sat here for 3 hrs even if I had. So, what difference does it make?
_BenWright_	723908552289599488	2016-04-23T16:17:03	ToFlyToServeSubjectToOurT&amp;CsUnderSection3c7 Biz_Hack British_Airways
_BenWright_	723902555357622272	2016-04-23T15:53:13	British_Airways Fantastic! Something to read as I while away the long hours in Terminal 5. Any other recommendations?
_BenWright_	723901788978556928	2016-04-23T15:50:10	British_Airways Just spoke to 5th member of BA staff. Further delay. Word "sorry" again conspicuous by absence (Tho I appreciate u used it)
_BenWright_	723893456519761920	2016-04-23T15:17:03	British_Airways So, in this particular case (small sample), I am enjoying all of the downside and none of the benefits of yr business model
_BenWright_	723892887012794370	2016-04-23T15:14:48	British_Airways Thanks. I am aware of that. I am a business reporter. But I had to pay twice for this ticket because of zero flexibility.
_BenWright_	723888440488636416	2016-04-23T14:57:08	British_Airways "Oversubscribed" suggests it is your customers' fault. "Oversold" is more accurate. Don't sell more tickets than seats.
_BenWright_	723867294938615808	2016-04-23T13:33:06	Biz travelling on Sat. Told flight's delayed. Then it's "oversold". Then 3 hr wait to see if you're even going. Thanks British_Airways !!!

_BenWright_	722698556524621824	2016-04-20T08:08:57	Michael Gove is wrong:cool-headed evaluation of Brexit risks is not unpatriotic. My column on Brexit costs 
_BenWright_	722444808401326080	2016-04-19T15:20:39	Here's the key passage in the Open Europe report: 
_BenWright_	722444586543685632	2016-04-19T15:19:46	Treasury report said key to growth within EU is high immigration.   Open Europe said key to growth outside the EU is high immigration.

_BenWright_	722094716251201536	2016-04-18T16:09:30	3. Instead it builds economic case based on immigration numbers it disavows, allowing Remain to steal its trump card.
_BenWright_	722094327078526976	2016-04-18T16:07:58	2. Remain could have stolen Leave's trump card by making +ve economic case for immigration
_BenWright_	722094229779034115	2016-04-18T16:07:34	1. Remain's trump card = the economy (and the risks posed to it by Brexit)  Leave's trump card = immigration
