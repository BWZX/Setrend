dickc	687819974056914944	2016-01-15T02:13:55	brianp what's "pace" in the comparison? Was wondering where they were compared to that Bulls team (I was in Chicago for that!)

dickc	686712159741456384	2016-01-12T00:51:52	krjepsen yes. Just noticed that.  Different moment, still better shot :)
dickc	686711040369770496	2016-01-12T00:47:25	dickc better version and view of this moment

dickc	685959289626689536	2016-01-09T23:00:13	BillSimmons crazy 2nd &amp; 3rd down calls with over a minute left, near midfield, and the Texans' currently inept offense. Yikes

dickc	684134007726972930	2016-01-04T22:07:12	mims not sure why the intersection of the supply/demand curve is uber's problem - like saying "man outraged by price of Cartier watch"
