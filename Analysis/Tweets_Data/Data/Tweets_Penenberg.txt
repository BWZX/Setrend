Penenberg	719922617457709056	2016-04-12T16:18:22	It’s ludicrous. We had been paying off our mortgage every month, never a late payment. We simply were trying to take advantage of lower rate

Penenberg	719922042397659138	2016-04-12T16:16:05	Then we refinanced with another bank, which was only modestly better. Same low rate, though, so in the end we came out ahead.
Penenberg	719921830367203328	2016-04-12T16:15:14	Ultimately we gave up after the 6th or 7th time that paperwork we had submitted “expired" due to their inaction.
Penenberg	719921658551791616	2016-04-12T16:14:33	Funny thing was we already had a mortgage with this bank and were “preferred clients.” We were simply trying to lower our rates.
Penenberg	719921184163368961	2016-04-12T16:12:40	After resubmitting paperwork other paperwork would expire. We were told to resubmit. We did. Then other paperwork expired. Rinse, repeat.
Penenberg	719921016785498113	2016-04-12T16:12:00	OK, sounded good. We submitted all the paperwork. Then waited. Bank would tell us some paperwork expired so we had to resubmit. We did.
Penenberg	719920867963191297	2016-04-12T16:11:25	We remortgaged recently. In our case my bank approached us and suggested we remortgage to take advantage of lower rates.
