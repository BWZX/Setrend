ExumAM	719257296640061440	2016-04-10T20:14:37	.ExumAM Such an interesting thread you started. Sometimes I think reporting is just reporting: Curiosity, humility compassion.
ExumAM	719275395531599872	2016-04-10T21:26:32	LizSly Totally agree. Would also say this is why the best war reporting I have seen is often done by teams.
