jnvest	684013353891676161	2016-01-04T14:07:46	@HuckFund I think FrancoOlivera mentioned at some point that he's a competitive manager
jnvest	684013210802978816	2016-01-04T14:07:12	@HuckFund Also, Ramos joined quite recently so I think there could be some potential on rationalizing/enhancing the operations

jnvest	683734736016142336	2016-01-03T19:40:38	Uluwatuu Yeah probably, this is why I wonder about the fund (or the perception of it) because it has had tailwinds from lower NOK as well
jnvest	683730250228981760	2016-01-03T19:22:49	Uluwatuu I think having edge in macro requires understanding other speculators/investors &amp; flows in addition to nailing the fundamentals
jnvest	683724874716700673	2016-01-03T19:01:27	Uluwatuu Really jealous about Norway gov/officials, econ. policies seem reasonable to outsider. In Fin oil $ would have been spent already
jnvest	683723816380575745	2016-01-03T18:57:15	Uluwatuu Problem is when something becomes clear to the mkt, its often too late. Might still try it out, pay some tuition $ and learn more
jnvest	683721577003937792	2016-01-03T18:48:21	Uluwatuu Great, these help. I also have to ponder the EUR angle here, which helps as long as it doesnt get strong, still feel bearish on it

jnvest	683020232890429442	2016-01-01T20:21:28	jnvest When something looks clear to most people in market, it's probably already too late (ht someone I forgot)
jnvest	683020091873734660	2016-01-01T20:20:54	jnvest If you think you are smarter than the market and feel arrogant, consider possibility of being wrong

jnvest	683019336261480448	2016-01-01T20:17:54	jnvest Just b/c Buffett/someone else says he ignores macro/whatever doesn't mean you shouldn't learn/make your own conclusions
jnvest	683019237154287616	2016-01-01T20:17:30	jnvest Also, just because someone wrote something x years ago doesn't mean they think so today
jnvest	683019145634516993	2016-01-01T20:17:08	jnvest Just because Buffett said something smart 20 years ago doesn't mean it fits every context
jnvest	683019017125249024	2016-01-01T20:16:38	jnvest Be careful when listening to smart investors &amp; putting them on pedestal:
jnvest	683018943116787713	2016-01-01T20:16:20	jnvest If you don't enjoy the process, it's probably not worth it
jnvest	683018829518270466	2016-01-01T20:15:53	jnvest Tracker position creates a good incentive for further DD &amp; to follow the stock more closely

jnvest	683017511852441600	2016-01-01T20:10:39	jnvest Always analyze what you did wrong. "Bad luck" is the worst excuse, there are almost always signs
jnvest	683017261112782848	2016-01-01T20:09:39	jnvest Appreciate your mistakes because they are usually the best lessons you get
jnvest	683017183627186176	2016-01-01T20:09:21	jnvest It might be a mistake to only look 1-2 years forward instead of 5+ years
jnvest	683017078270488577	2016-01-01T20:08:55	jnvest It's amazing how often a lot of bad news surface in short period of time (headline risk)
jnvest	683016992538935297	2016-01-01T20:08:35	jnvest Be careful w/ biz that public perceives to "exploit the weakest" (scrutiny, political points)
jnvest	683016839614611457	2016-01-01T20:07:59	jnvest No need to label yourself - it's counterproductive at best
jnvest	683016765320880130	2016-01-01T20:07:41	jnvest Different styles aren't mutually exclusive
jnvest	683016670684823552	2016-01-01T20:07:18	jnvest Don't dismiss short-selling either without experimenting. If you can't get comfortable, try to understand why
jnvest	683016574379388928	2016-01-01T20:06:55	jnvest A lot of people/algos trade according to charts, it's foolish not to study what they do/how they think
jnvest	683016466950676480	2016-01-01T20:06:30	jnvest Pay attention to trends, humor yourself with drawing trendlines. You might be surprised
jnvest	683016375120572417	2016-01-01T20:06:08	jnvest If you look down to or get a negative reaction about different style, ask yourself why. It might not be rational
jnvest	683016193234595840	2016-01-01T20:05:24	jnvest Don't dismiss them w/o understanding or experimenting with their style / Seek to know what the other side of your trade is thinking
jnvest	683016027358269440	2016-01-01T20:04:45	jnvest Follow different kinds of investors in fintwit/elsewhere, try to understand how they think
