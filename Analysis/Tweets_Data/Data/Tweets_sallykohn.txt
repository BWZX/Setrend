sallykohn	709528144110350336	2016-03-14T23:54:26	You can agree or disagree w protest tactics, whichever side is the target. But violence against protesters is wrong!

sallykohn	709484550678831105	2016-03-14T21:01:13	Thank you AshleyRParker for this important, evocative and haunting reflection on violence at Trump rallies: 
sallykohn	709397479230455808	2016-03-14T15:15:13	Mr "Protesters Are Infringing On My Right To Free Speech" Trump wants to change libel law so can sue anyone who says things he doesn't like

sallykohn	709376875773222912	2016-03-14T13:53:21	So when armed militia takes over govt property, right says hands off. But protester at Trump rally? "Next time we might have to kill him"?!?
sallykohn	709369378379317248	2016-03-14T13:23:33	"In Germany, they came first for the Communists, And I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist..." 
sallykohn	709366731614068737	2016-03-14T13:13:02	Protesting hate in both instances. And standing up for equality and justice. Comparison seems pretty clear.
