IcebergResear	720898212828065794	2016-04-15T08:55:02	Fenwick61 AdamBakhtiarCNA Indeed. Noble should be cautious when they talk about regulation. Their actions should lead to investigations.
IcebergResear	720891144700190720	2016-04-15T08:26:57	Kudos AdamBakhtiarCNA for being the first journalist to ask: why do you sue Iceberg? They seem to have a point. 
IcebergResear	720459800375607303	2016-04-14T03:52:56	Every 3 months, Noble's chairman picks a different newspaper and repeats the crisis is over. Funny answers:  
IcebergResear	720075170040426496	2016-04-13T02:24:33	For Noble's AGM tomorrow, we asked 13 questions to management.

IcebergResear	712658735236194304	2016-03-23T15:14:17	In its annual report Noble mentions a 25-year coal contract in Indonesia.  They have trouble performing six months contracts there!
IcebergResear	712580717285224448	2016-03-23T10:04:16	@KeshikCapital humenm because the market does not realise yet that Noble will be working for the banks going forward.
IcebergResear	712579619380011008	2016-03-23T09:59:55	@KeshikCapital humenm Noble is probably under watchlist in all these banks.
IcebergResear	707511119435333633	2016-03-09T10:19:30	BlakeFox7 Bond and equity holders can worry. They are the first victims here.
IcebergResear	707509672362659841	2016-03-09T10:13:45	BlakeFox7 Would be a perfectly normal reaction for the banks. If the balance sheet is not reliable, collateral needs to be provided.
IcebergResear	707499474713714689	2016-03-09T09:33:14	Noble Group asked to pay almost 300bps all-in for a secured facility. That is incredibly expensive.

IcebergResear	704286517674516480	2016-02-29T12:46:05	Awkward: Noble Group quotes an investor who wants to sell his wife and buys Noble's shares. Weekend screenshot. 
IcebergResear	703205002253193217	2016-02-26T13:08:32	Translation: that was a good magic show but now we understand the tricks so we don't want to watch it anymore.

IcebergResear	701941122894008320	2016-02-23T01:26:19	Oh and by the way Noble Group is still suing us. So they must be right and we must be wrong.
IcebergResear	701940612493348865	2016-02-23T01:24:18	Explanations given to justify the $1.2b loss of Noble will make any commodity specialist laugh.
IcebergResear	701940221538136064	2016-02-23T01:22:44	$1.2b of impairment for Noble's fair values. This number is only a compromise with the auditor. Problem much bigger than that.

IcebergResear	691948631054749697	2016-01-26T11:39:44	Update on Noble Group coming tomorrow
IcebergResear	690487847216742401	2016-01-22T10:55:06	AbsoluteAlpha92 there is no point with equity. These contracts are vastly overvalued and counterparties are... Sundance Resources...
IcebergResear	690484245672755200	2016-01-22T10:40:47	Elman: It takes time to bring investors. Oh really?  It's a $5b equity company and it's worth $1.3b. It's a bargain. Why is that so hard?
IcebergResear	690480656086728704	2016-01-22T10:26:31	2015 Elman prediction: "The Iceberg matter is finished". Share price down 67% since. 2016 Elman prediction: "We feel that it's behind us."

IcebergResear	685116107326275584	2016-01-07T15:09:43	Our comments after S&amp;P's downgrade. Debt crisis and lack of management credibility slowly drive Noble to bankruptcy. 
IcebergResear	685048106639962113	2016-01-07T10:39:30	Noble Group downgraded to junk by S&amp;P. We were defamed, sued, attacked by this management. For what? All our arguments validated one by one.
IcebergResear	685045842995118080	2016-01-07T10:30:31	BlakeFox7 Interesting idea. We wont tell any story and if there is some value, the market will believe us. But they are still suing us...
IcebergResear	684978846081261568	2016-01-07T06:04:17	Noble's share price down 71% since our first report and will continue to fall.
IcebergResear	681902219164278789	2015-12-29T18:18:52	@b1anking they have positive OCF and positive FCF. They sit on tangible assets. Much better risk.
IcebergResear	681886117835194368	2015-12-29T17:14:53	And no Noble isn't asset light in reality.  Exposure to poor counterparties (behind the MTM) makes them very vulnerable to low commo prices.
IcebergResear	681883246054010880	2015-12-29T17:03:29	Noble downgraded to junk by Moody's. This has never been investment grade. A late but necessary adjustment. Rating should be much worse.
IcebergResear	681873651126386688	2015-12-29T16:25:21	Boom. Moody's cuts Noble to junk status. 
IcebergResear	679865283813752832	2015-12-24T03:24:49	@b1anking Many others. FFO include mark-to-market which makes it an irrelevant metric for Noble
IcebergResear	679851484687790080	2015-12-24T02:29:59	@b1anking we dont. A trader always needs inventories and suppliers need to be paid with inventory proceeds. A zero-stock trader is a fiction
