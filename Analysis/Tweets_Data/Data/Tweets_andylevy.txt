andylevy	726174752184770561	2016-04-29T22:22:07	jktrotter MikeIsaac lol
andylevy	726174199895588864	2016-04-29T22:19:55	jktrotter oh sure don't copy mike on the one that says 'fair!'
andylevy	726173148274561025	2016-04-29T22:15:44	jktrotter MikeIsaac and i said i agreed that he shouldn't have asked for it to be taken down, nor should esquire have done so
andylevy	726172981894893569	2016-04-29T22:15:05	DKThomp MikeIsaac right, i said i agreed that jarvis shouldn't have asked to have it taken down
andylevy	726172391378849792	2016-04-29T22:12:44	jktrotter MikeIsaac i mean regardless of how u feel, that's a garbage disclaimer
andylevy	726172221970866176	2016-04-29T22:12:04	DKThomp MikeIsaac that was added after jarvis complained
andylevy	726172084821319680	2016-04-29T22:11:31	jktrotter MikeIsaac right but it's not strictly satirical, so absent a disclosure, it's not unreasonable to think that some ppl won't know
andylevy	726169238340161537	2016-04-29T22:00:12	MikeIsaac agree. but i seem to be in the minority in thinking that he wasnt wrong in asking that it be made clearer that he didn't write it
andylevy	726168864166318080	2016-04-29T21:58:43	MikeIsaac yeah ur right 
andylevy	726168201499811840	2016-04-29T21:56:05	MikeIsaac agree, but wasn't jarvis' original complaint that there wasn't any such disclaimer?
andylevy	726167790256713728	2016-04-29T21:54:27	MikeIsaac the problem with that trump example is that 'the onion' is a recognized humor/satire site

andylevy	690427782216728576	2016-01-22T06:56:25	JeffSharlet agree that ultimately it won’t mean much but i think it’s aimed at cons/righties who are considering trump but aren’t 100% sure
andylevy	690412516703408128	2016-01-22T05:55:45	MZHemingway yeah there’s a lotta that going around tonight on the left
andylevy	690412028255682560	2016-01-22T05:53:49	JeffSharlet no, i disagree with ur characterization of it being an “elite” attack on tackiness, tho i’m sure trump supporters agree with u
andylevy	690411352884641793	2016-01-22T05:51:08	JeffSharlet ok. completely disagree
andylevy	690410988588367872	2016-01-22T05:49:41	JeffSharlet …and i’m all for anyone making that case
andylevy	690410713806958592	2016-01-22T05:48:36	JeffSharlet i dunno. i just feel like it’s not aimed at u (or me) - it’s meant to present a conservative case why trump is no good…
andylevy	690409758566785024	2016-01-22T05:44:48	JeffSharlet have u read it?
andylevy	690407996304822273	2016-01-22T05:37:48	JeffSharlet i do not at all understand the liberal/lefty attacks on NR over this. would u prefer they stayed silent?
