ryantate	724398433331732480	2016-04-25T00:43:39	hamiltonnolan Yes. Great if you can get more building investment despite serious downside risk. But current pipeline is healthy.
ryantate	724397783210450944	2016-04-25T00:41:04	TaraMikk ... I just think regulation in SF particularly gets way too much blame and progress too little recognition. It's densifying slowly
ryantate	724397448957927425	2016-04-25T00:39:45	TaraMikk I'd love more housing all over BA; density huge reason I moved to nyc in '14. S. Bay and N. Bay probably worst. That said...
ryantate	724396646348533762	2016-04-25T00:36:33	hamiltonnolan it certainly doesn't mean fully meeting demand (driven by dumb VCs) that will implode in next few years and crater rents
ryantate	724396245121413120	2016-04-25T00:34:58	Jerry Brown built 10,000 units in downtown Oakland in 8 years. Lots of towers. Was insane pace by all accounts. Rents insane there too.
ryantate	724395910650798080	2016-04-25T00:33:38	Anyway it's funny when people who paid SF no mind 2001-2012 (when I wrote on building) claim it doesn't built dense housing. Built loads!
ryantate	724395268930699265	2016-04-25T00:31:05	In how many of these "just build more housing" pieces are credible economists - or any economists - ever quoted? Basically never.
ryantate	724394716201127936	2016-04-25T00:28:53	It is an incredibly attractive city with global demand, not some closed system. Supply will always pale; building will always sell steeply.
ryantate	724394252134940676	2016-04-25T00:27:02	Also, as a Berkeley prof explained to me ~10 yrs ago, SF cannot build its way to affordability. Lower prices just lure even more outsiders.
ryantate	724393761153925120	2016-04-25T00:25:05	.... Early 80s, it has happened time and time again in SF since the gold rush. So the city embraces rational defenses like rent control.
ryantate	724393563447025668	2016-04-25T00:24:18	There is no healthy way to meet that market, no matter how much you deregulate. It is an idiot wind. Passed through 2010s, 2000, early 90s
ryantate	724393325919408130	2016-04-25T00:23:22	The problem is bad unsustainable investments made en masse by idiot VCs during bubbles funding renters who will exodus in 1-3 years.
ryantate	724392934230134792	2016-04-25T00:21:48	But sure they will use the spike in rents to clamor for the usual deregulation all big business loves. But regulation is not the problem.
ryantate	724392772678103040	2016-04-25T00:21:10	The thing is, SF landlords are on to the VC scam. They do not want to build housing at rents that will collapse when dumb companies implode.
ryantate	724388726353350657	2016-04-25T00:05:05	hamiltonnolan the development pipeline has been quite healthy for &gt; decade
ryantate	724328028231360514	2016-04-24T20:03:53	They've been building housing guys. Willie Brown and Jerry Brown were not known for doing things by the book. Nor was Gavin Newsom!
ryantate	724327826363682816	2016-04-24T20:03:05	Look up the history of Four Seasons SF on . Or Oakland's never built Essex. So many others i could list.
ryantate	724327633467641856	2016-04-24T20:02:19	Anyway I covered SF after the 2000 bust. I wrote about so many instances where a developer built tower to serve dot com economy, took bath
ryantate	724327338633207808	2016-04-24T20:01:09	A city like Houston or Phoenix (both boomtowns) can build their way out of housing price spikes. But they have space. Can build single story
ryantate	724326845823496192	2016-04-24T19:59:12	(Yes regulation can easily add 1-2 years. But most of that is state CEQA environmental law not SF specific.)
ryantate	724326598862868481	2016-04-24T19:58:13	2. It takes a lot of time to physically build a steel tower. Two years is not unusual. Meanwhile market can, probably will tank.
ryantate	724326322978316288	2016-04-24T19:57:07	1. It's a boom bust economy. Has been for decades. This makes investing in big towers even more risky that usual.
ryantate	724326033164476417	2016-04-24T19:55:58	There are sufficient *market based* reasons SF housing prices have spiked. If you actually stick around the Bay Area they become obvious.
