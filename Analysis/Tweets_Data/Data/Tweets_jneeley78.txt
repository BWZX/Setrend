jneeley78	724332385903353856	2016-04-24T20:21:12	8. And it's not just explicit sex. GoT is also part of a larger trend towards gruesomeness in popular culture: 
jneeley78	724332309713809408	2016-04-24T20:20:54	7. I don't say any of this to judge people. It's just an indication of how much the culture has changed in recent decades
jneeley78	724332245079584768	2016-04-24T20:20:39	6. What's amazing is not that this stuff exists, but how mainstream it's become. I know lots of conservative Christians who watch GoT

jneeley78	724331985129213953	2016-04-24T20:19:37	4. Now 2010 has come and gone, and Fox hasn't exactly turned into a hardcore sex channel. But HBO? Well...
jneeley78	724331902061039616	2016-04-24T20:19:17	3. And Marge says to Homer "You know, Fox turned into a hardcore sex channel so gradually, I didn't even notice."
jneeley78	724331840127934464	2016-04-24T20:19:02	2. There's a scene in the episode where Homer and Marge are watching tv, and you can hear stereotypical porn music coming from the tv.
jneeley78	724331732208484352	2016-04-24T20:18:37	1. So there's a Simpsons episode from a couple of decades ago called "Lisa's Wedding." It's set in the (then future) of 2010.
