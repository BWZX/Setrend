AnthonyQuintano	720302280516308993	2016-04-13T17:27:00	MatthewKnell Facebook is basically rebuilding Hangouts from scratch
AnthonyQuintano	720302196902862848	2016-04-13T17:26:40	MatthewKnell Appreciate that. I went through lots of tech conversations with Google when Hangouts launched.
AnthonyQuintano	720301449544990722	2016-04-13T17:23:42	MatthewKnell it's all good! This is the one area that i'm actually knowledgable in üòâ
AnthonyQuintano	720300795925700608	2016-04-13T17:21:06	MatthewKnell The Mevo itself doesn't have an audio in. It will take audio from your iPhone if you plugin in audio device there, over Wifi
AnthonyQuintano	720300384787431428	2016-04-13T17:19:28	MatthewKnell see the "via iOS device"
AnthonyQuintano	720299809081397249	2016-04-13T17:17:11	AdamBritten BuzzFeed yep
AnthonyQuintano	720299636309696513	2016-04-13T17:16:30	MatthewKnell also depending on what type of connection it is, you are fighting the same battled with the phones.
AnthonyQuintano	720299439500308481	2016-04-13T17:15:43	MatthewKnell audio out? That doesn't help. You need an audio input.
AnthonyQuintano	720299308579299329	2016-04-13T17:15:12	Apparently a lot of reporters got burned by a guy who tweeted about a McDonald's millshake. üòÇ Now reporters are angry.

AnthonyQuintano	719994864989921280	2016-04-12T21:05:27	MatthewKnell I miss our talks dude :) hope to see you in August when i visit NYC
AnthonyQuintano	719993899272396800	2016-04-12T21:01:37	MatthewKnell I don't think so. Most you had to build your audience. With Facebook many already have millions.
AnthonyQuintano	719993567662333952	2016-04-12T21:00:18	MatthewKnell We went through all this with Google+ Hangouts and  and ustream before that.
AnthonyQuintano	719993474691411968	2016-04-12T20:59:55	MatthewKnell Most already have the equipment to broadcast with pro audio and video.
AnthonyQuintano	719993252854673408	2016-04-12T20:59:02	MatthewKnell Depends. Either way you're going to want people to be able to hear what your broadcasting.
AnthonyQuintano	719993026592903170	2016-04-12T20:58:09	MatthewKnell incorrect. The software allows you to hook to a computer which will allow more options of pro tools from pro cams to audio
AnthonyQuintano	719992877300862978	2016-04-12T20:57:33	MatthewKnell Correct on broadcasting, but not sure what that has to do with the functionality of the mevo
AnthonyQuintano	719992415650603008	2016-04-12T20:55:43	MatthewKnell Audio will be terrible from that little toy.
AnthonyQuintano	719992369983004672	2016-04-12T20:55:32	MatthewKnell Absolutely. Especially when using outdoors. That built-in mic will not do the trick. Also with wide angle, cam has to be far
AnthonyQuintano	719991919183400960	2016-04-12T20:53:44	Especially ones that are in video/television. The other developer options for streaming to Facebook will be the go-to options with pro gear
AnthonyQuintano	719991766066171904	2016-04-12T20:53:08	The Mevo is cool and all but does not allow for pro audio which everyone is struggling with currently. I don't feel many media orgs will use

AnthonyQuintano	718406710210142208	2016-04-08T11:54:41	LivaJudic the problem is that hard news doesn't drive traffic. The fluff does. There is no reason why a publisher can't support both.
