Gartenberg	724956762344951809	2016-04-26T13:42:15	Gartenberg favourite features: turn-by-turn walking directions on the wrist &amp; increased phone battery life from leaving it in pocket more
Gartenberg	724956527170338816	2016-04-26T13:41:19	Gartenberg Wearing it very day. Love it. Setting timer in kitchen is great. Notifications are essential, no more pocket buzzing.
Gartenberg	724956212987584512	2016-04-26T13:40:04	Gartenberg Yes. Best feature is very fine tuned notifications. It’s a terrible “watch” though, lots of room for improvement.

Gartenberg	711971063912071168	2016-03-21T17:41:44	Joz humor falling a little flat today.
Gartenberg	711971007989473280	2016-03-21T17:41:30	Like the Night Shift feature but it’s another thing developers havn’t been able to trap into
Gartenberg	711970798576259073	2016-03-21T17:40:40	Hi reneritchie wave please
Gartenberg	711970712836296705	2016-03-21T17:40:20	The 80% iOS number is excellent and shows the weakness of new Android OS adoption
Gartenberg	711970561853882369	2016-03-21T17:39:44	$17 installment price is pretty sweet. Can definitely drive some new iPhone sales and push some upgrades who didn’t want big
Gartenberg	711970276045676545	2016-03-21T17:38:36	No 128gb model for the SE. Nope, won’t be the device for me
Gartenberg	711970013368836096	2016-03-21T17:37:33	Gartenberg I didn't upgrade to iPhone 5 (or beyond) because I felt it was too big. But now I'm finally willing to upgrade.
Gartenberg	711970028250337281	2016-03-21T17:37:37	SE stuff would sound awesome against the 5s, except we’ve heard them all before.
Gartenberg	711969831722033152	2016-03-21T17:36:50	Rose Gold still looks pink to me

Gartenberg	711969627090202627	2016-03-21T17:36:01	All the new radios too, LTE Advanced, 802.11ac. Apple Pay built in!
Gartenberg	711969615782551561	2016-03-21T17:35:58	Hmmm pschiller joke fell flat
Gartenberg	711969465240559617	2016-03-21T17:35:22	Anyone want to trade me an SE for a 6s+?
Gartenberg	711969364329799680	2016-03-21T17:34:58	If I were buying today, I’d opt for an iPhone SE. I just don’t think I’d trade in my existing 6s+ for it…
Gartenberg	711969170984996864	2016-03-21T17:34:12	The SE is pretty much the 6s minus 3D Touch as expected.
Gartenberg	711969020791144452	2016-03-21T17:33:36	iPhone SE name leak was dead on
Gartenberg	711968845087576064	2016-03-21T17:32:55	Joz trivia. Please name the year and venue of his keynote debut
Gartenberg	711968723305947136	2016-03-21T17:32:26	4″ iPhone, yep some folks just want smaller phones and some will be first timers.
Gartenberg	711968600513454080	2016-03-21T17:31:56	It’s JOZ! Long time Apple guy who’s awesome. Nice to see him back on stage
Gartenberg	711968387342192641	2016-03-21T17:31:05	New version of TV OS adds some nice features but 9.3 has already been talked about to death

Gartenberg	711968060412981248	2016-03-21T17:29:47	AG Drive is fantastic on Apple TV. Just buy it OK, then delete Ridge Racer
Gartenberg	711967927436759040	2016-03-21T17:29:16	I agree apps are the future of television but we’re not there just yet. Apple TV just not good enough to take input  one
Gartenberg	711967658304995328	2016-03-21T17:28:12	Apple TV is awesome. 5,000 apps so pretty impressive

Gartenberg	711967475378884608	2016-03-21T17:27:28	Apple Watch down to $299 is important. Certainly will help drive adoption
Gartenberg	711967320986533888	2016-03-21T17:26:51	New bands are pretty cool . I’m in
Gartenberg	711967239449214976	2016-03-21T17:26:32	dmoren Awesome, Amazing also drink

Gartenberg	711966997395931137	2016-03-21T17:25:34	Almost 30 minutes in and not a mention of a new product.
Gartenberg	711966710782296064	2016-03-21T17:24:26	“Today, we’d like to announce a new way to help you ensure your place in the afterlife: We call it SoulKit.”
Gartenberg	711966654540992516	2016-03-21T17:24:12	CareKit will be open source and available in April. Looks fantastic. A new generation of care.
Gartenberg	711966699960971264	2016-03-21T17:24:23	There’s a lack of energy I think… Is it just me?
Gartenberg	711965693563031553	2016-03-21T17:20:23	If this Apple event does not end with a commercial about the spaceship campus lifting off and letting us colonize Mars, I’m out.
Gartenberg	711965667621269508	2016-03-21T17:20:17	ShawnKing I do. And can drive new sales of existing users
Gartenberg	711965582820769792	2016-03-21T17:19:57	Privacy, Environmental responsibility, health are 3 areas I hope other companies try to copy Apple, not just hardware design AppleEvent
Gartenberg	711964921051926529	2016-03-21T17:17:19	Recycling is awesome, and another way to drive new users
Gartenberg	711964746778591232	2016-03-21T17:16:37	Good way to fill in the time without beating the chest about numbers  
Gartenberg	711964357416996864	2016-03-21T17:15:05	The environmental and health segments in this event are taking the place of the usual "we've sold SO MANY THINGS" segment.
Gartenberg	711964231696928770	2016-03-21T17:14:35	Yay Apple Renew. This is radical. Thank you, Apple, for making hardware recycling convenient and easy.
Gartenberg	711964576858902528	2016-03-21T17:15:57	Health follows privacy,  and environment. Great opening but portends an event that might be product light
Gartenberg	711964234163167233	2016-03-21T17:14:35	Not bad, privacy and the environment to kick off a product launch
Gartenberg	711963892197560320	2016-03-21T17:13:14	The green Apple stem on the end of the Liam video was pretty great. AppleEvent
Gartenberg	711964047344869376	2016-03-21T17:13:51	Liam knows more about helping the environment than any candidate running for president. OnlyApple
Gartenberg	711963783883653120	2016-03-21T17:12:48	No new iPhone is going to be as cool as the fact that APPLE BUILT AN iPHONE RECYCLING ROBOT.
Gartenberg	711963715042742272	2016-03-21T17:12:31	Liam is another great Apple hire. He’s expected to be fully sentient around 2018
Gartenberg	711963489749835776	2016-03-21T17:11:38	Lisa Jackson embodies Tim’s philosophy that Apple’s mission is to make the world a better place, not just great products.
Gartenberg	711962928182767618	2016-03-21T17:09:24	Thrilled to see Apple’s VP of Environmental, Policy, and Social Initiatives Lisa Jackson on stage. Huge day for Apple’s many great women.
Gartenberg	711963030188396544	2016-03-21T17:09:48	Lisa’s certainly not just a token woman on stage. She’s the real deal and former head of the EPA. One of TIm’s best hires
Gartenberg	711962261296848897	2016-03-21T17:06:45	Seems Gartenberg was on the money about women (appropriately) being given stage time today. Lisa Jackson up now.
Gartenberg	711962611613622272	2016-03-21T17:08:08	I don’t know of another company that would use a product launch to talk about their 100% renewable energy efforts
Gartenberg	711962402208817154	2016-03-21T17:07:18	I’ve had the privilege of working with Lisa Jackson. There’s no one more suited for this role.
Gartenberg	711962200966045697	2016-03-21T17:06:30	Tim’s talking about Apple and the environment. Lisa Jackson taking the stage.
Gartenberg	711962069520785408	2016-03-21T17:05:59	Apple’s getting a lot of applause for Tim’s comments.
Gartenberg	711961856089399296	2016-03-21T17:05:08	Gartenberg that's an accomplishment for Apple for sure, but keep in mind Android hit 1B devices globally in 2014. perspective
Gartenberg	711961888209375232	2016-03-21T17:05:16	You rarely see Tinm Cook in a sweater onstage
Gartenberg	711961773067411457	2016-03-21T17:04:48	Good moment for Tim to take the time and talk about the battle with the FBI
Gartenberg	711961642922336257	2016-03-21T17:04:17	I can vouch that Apple’s goal is to create products that change and impact people’s lives in a positive way
Gartenberg	711961481621970945	2016-03-21T17:03:39	1 billion Apple devices in use around the world. Pretty incredible
Gartenberg	711961386461634565	2016-03-21T17:03:16	Very unusual for Apple to ever look back, it’s always been about what’s next
Gartenberg	711961270463930368	2016-03-21T17:02:49	Fun start to the keynote 40 years in 4o seconds. Newton shtick was especially fun Apple
Gartenberg	711960938895831041	2016-03-21T17:01:30	I suspect there won’t be underdressed  women at today’s event.
Gartenberg	711960689653456897	2016-03-21T17:00:30	chuq heh heh. I’d put really good money and say that would never ever happen at Apple
Gartenberg	711960515346612224	2016-03-21T16:59:49	And jsnell is in the house. His analysis last week of Apple events was awesome.  
Gartenberg	711960229701771264	2016-03-21T16:58:40	Nice to have live Apple event commentary from gartenberg once again! 
Gartenberg	711960331854032896	2016-03-21T16:59:05	Chris_Ciaccia some of that has to do with uh, body type and who’s been hiring the fitness center :)
Gartenberg	711960070138019840	2016-03-21T16:58:02	Past criticism of Apple events was the lack of women on stage. I wonder if that changes today.
Gartenberg	711959935303688192	2016-03-21T16:57:30	One key question today will be who is tucked and who is untucked.
Gartenberg	711958483386687489	2016-03-21T16:51:44	ShawnKing I needed to reboot
Gartenberg	711958095975550977	2016-03-21T16:50:12	ShawnKing hmmm.. Mine is silent….
Gartenberg	711957821865254913	2016-03-21T16:49:06	crazy fact: today marks the 18th anniversary of the first rumor that the thunderbolt display would be updated
Gartenberg	711957540024807424	2016-03-21T16:47:59	Gartenberg Hey, if analysts aren't going to share photos of analysts, somebody has to fill the void.

Gartenberg	711932197574467584	2016-03-21T15:07:17	chuq hmmmm. Perhaps both although now that you mentioned if I never thought  about it becoming a marketing stunt.
Gartenberg	711931972076097536	2016-03-21T15:06:23	justindrew yep. And doesn't work very well in general. Hue and WeMo controlled by Alexa here.

Gartenberg	711907683931136000	2016-03-21T13:29:53	PS Vue makes a good argument for cord cutting. Apple TV with a PS Vue service could be a contender for input 1 on my TV. You?
Gartenberg	711907446642573312	2016-03-21T13:28:56	PS Vue does support local networks in NY but no CW and no mobile live streaming for the networks.
Gartenberg	711907272209866753	2016-03-21T13:28:14	PS Vue is odd. Doesn't support AirPlay on iOS but will do Chromecast. Even stranger is no native Android app.

Gartenberg	711899108253016064	2016-03-21T12:55:48	ICYMI, the Apple Store is down. I Wonder why?
Gartenberg	711898788626087936	2016-03-21T12:54:32	steve_haney yep, Pencil is awesome but of limited appeal to attract users IMHO. Of course could be more than one iPad event this year?
Gartenberg	711898556102275073	2016-03-21T12:53:36	bermaniastudios now that would be interesting.

Gartenberg	711898249867730944	2016-03-21T12:52:23	steve_haney yep but if  users don't perceive innovation, perhaps it's not there.
Gartenberg	711898051355549696	2016-03-21T12:51:36	Trixxy and some nice tie ins go advance HomeKit. Alexa would be out of work for me
Gartenberg	711897894878650370	2016-03-21T12:50:59	steve_haney lots of cool stuff in the Pro and latest models with new OS should have ignited more interest

Gartenberg	711897169033306113	2016-03-21T12:48:06	davewiner a good point. Mindshare leads to market share.
Gartenberg	711897075865296896	2016-03-21T12:47:43	Trixxy useful but things like "hey Siri" or universal sign in to apps would have been more interesting to me.
Gartenberg	711896426427621377	2016-03-21T12:45:09	much of Apple's past success was the ability to explain new products in a compelling way. Apple needs a teacher not a visionary. Agree?
Gartenberg	711895902928171009	2016-03-21T12:43:04	hamsterRelish I could talk about the holograph experiments but I'd be killed
Gartenberg	711895799739899904	2016-03-21T12:42:39	eliasmakos truth is, there's a lot of difference in new devices. Apple just hasn't explained them at all.
Gartenberg	711895610694213632	2016-03-21T12:41:54	saschasegan makes sense to me actually. Perhaps why Apple pushing 3D Touch hard in ads. Still very iterative.
Gartenberg	711895407710887937	2016-03-21T12:41:06	pigduck I don't think I buy that theory. I think Steve was a great salesperson who knew how to teach and to sell.
Gartenberg	711895129305518080	2016-03-21T12:39:59	Techgasms mine too. If you have a Pro, today's news would excite. If you don't have one, Apple seriously needs to teach why you would.
Gartenberg	711894889500450817	2016-03-21T12:39:02	WarnerCrocker selling more phones would be good for Apple but won't generate much enthusiasm.
Gartenberg	711894720021176321	2016-03-21T12:38:22	davezatz saschasegan   It will be interesting if it's essentially a 6s in a smaller form but lacks 3D Touch
Gartenberg	711894259423698944	2016-03-21T12:36:32	justindrew I'd see more Siri features folded into Apple TV but needs a serious "hey Siri" mode to compete.
Gartenberg	711894075918589953	2016-03-21T12:35:48	justindrew I wonder if Echo is seen as a threat. If there's a comparable product would be a major coup for the day
Gartenberg	711893775208026113	2016-03-21T12:34:37	saschasegan potential for Apple is real to sell more phones but hard to get excited over.
Gartenberg	711893669020876801	2016-03-21T12:34:11	saschasegan I think has potential to fill a low end only. Users still have to choose larger form for latest features like 3D Touch.
Gartenberg	711893344557928449	2016-03-21T12:32:54	More important than a single product would be a clear message around iPad. I'm not sure users understand why they need a new tablet
Gartenberg	711893066794278912	2016-03-21T12:31:48	A smaller 6s would have been interesting to me.
Gartenberg	711892963035648000	2016-03-21T12:31:23	New watch bands, a small iPhone 6, a small iPad iPad Pro with minor updates to the platforms will be hard to get users excited over.
Gartenberg	711892734932611072	2016-03-21T12:30:28	Speculated products at today's Apple event don't feel revolutionary, or even evolutionary.

Gartenberg	701822037959036929	2016-02-22T17:33:07	riptari virtual Dad. New TV show idea.

Gartenberg	701802738691153920	2016-02-22T16:16:26	so far Surface 3 hardware is wonderful, latest update to Windows 10 are nice once you learn the paradigm but lack of apps drives me crazy
Gartenberg	701802546155933698	2016-02-22T16:15:40	DrPizza yeah, I found out my old client of choice no longer works at all. Once again, lack of native is a weak spot
Gartenberg	701802396540936192	2016-02-22T16:15:04	jsnell Dedo you know how many unqualified degrees we have together. We can do this. Know anyone who wants in on the spinal stuff?
Gartenberg	701802186515333120	2016-02-22T16:14:14	Definitely time for to weigh in with a few thousand words on MSFT, Windows, Office and you
Gartenberg	701802009297551362	2016-02-22T16:13:32	Wow, Windows 10 Office Tablet apps are awful compared to iPad version. Of course, Surface runs full Office so there’s that. fxshaw
Gartenberg	701801912681807872	2016-02-22T16:13:09	Today is Windows 10 day here. Best Twitter client? Anyone?
Gartenberg	701801555469713408	2016-02-22T16:11:44	harrymccracken  PBJ issue is nasty there. Jet BLue for the win and fan tasting WiFi. Pro top seat6b in coach is the best seat on plane
Gartenberg	701801075326611456	2016-02-22T16:09:49	Great advice from Flipboard's CEO. Reason #146 why I'm grateful to work for this company.  
Gartenberg	701801117861203969	2016-02-22T16:09:59	bermaniastudios yeah but then I’d have to go jdalrymple and there’s no going back once you start down that path
Gartenberg	701800972067205121	2016-02-22T16:09:25	jsnell nedwards harrymccracken what makes you think you’re safe if you’re unplugged :) I’d toss a burlap sack over it too
Gartenberg	701800847190183937	2016-02-22T16:08:55	I think I’d like to be a neurosurgeon. After all do have three advanced degrees, just not in anything related to neurosurgery.
Gartenberg	701800725110792193	2016-02-22T16:08:26	Also told I can no longer pull off “guy with beanie look” Also told I could never pull it off…. *sigh*
Gartenberg	701800525453512706	2016-02-22T16:07:38	Sadly the time has come when it no longer looks like hipster scruff, just a guy who didn’t shave. Grow a beard or shave it off
Gartenberg	701800339230629889	2016-02-22T16:06:54	nedwards jsnell harrymccracken so they say… So they say… This is how it starts. #1984
Gartenberg	701800267487035392	2016-02-22T16:06:37	jsnell harrymccracken me too, but I can live with it. Better wide angle &amp; low light. And no GOOG tinfoilhat
Gartenberg	701799839038832640	2016-02-22T16:04:55	harrymccracken jsnell I just have Alexa keep on eye on the place. Also like Canary at lot
Gartenberg	701799657844957184	2016-02-22T16:04:11	Set dressers simply like Apple products so they tend to use them. No conspiracy theories there.
Gartenberg	701799505721737216	2016-02-22T16:03:35	carlfranzen yes, it was a key element in the season… And played on an iPad :)
Gartenberg	701799285097107457	2016-02-22T16:02:43	Problem with a a standard like Miracast, it’s not a standard. Yes, iOS works flawlessly with Apple TV and OS X. AirPlay
Gartenberg	701799110983163904	2016-02-22T16:02:01	Miracast to wireless preojector test. Samsung Galaxy Edge - worked flawlessly with all content and network apps (except ABC)
Gartenberg	701798958541238273	2016-02-22T16:01:25	Miracast to wireless preojector test. IOS - Fail (but knew that going in) Windows 10 - Success but won’t play video from Hulu, Netflix, MSFT
Gartenberg	701798661475454976	2016-02-22T16:00:14	House of Cards really is an awesome Apple commercial. Also, only place anyone uses a Windows Phone
Gartenberg	701796190304600064	2016-02-22T15:50:25	"Apple is a uniquely American company." Yeah, it is 
Gartenberg	701795273820000256	2016-02-22T15:46:46	nice phone at a good price but a shame carriers won't likely carry it and I wonder if it will be in MSSFT retail  
Gartenberg	701794638173175808	2016-02-22T15:44:15	Another sign  how. Tim Cook is putting his imprimatur on Apple as CEO  
Gartenberg	701793683830603776	2016-02-22T15:40:27	bermaniastudios agree, so DON’T WORK THERE
Gartenberg	701793348248596481	2016-02-22T15:39:07	bermaniastudios the fact you looked at a second major says something in and of itself
Gartenberg	701793152588451840	2016-02-22T15:38:20	jsnell harrymccracken sure, they it’s not always on… I’d say that too if I were an evil company
Gartenberg	701786924294545408	2016-02-22T15:13:35	bermaniastudios you’re the exception of your generation that proves the rule :) I *know* that
Gartenberg	701786807357337600	2016-02-22T15:13:08	bermaniastudios don’t work in a startup if you don’t want that lifestyle. No one’s forcing here to work there or live beyond her means.
Gartenberg	701786539408420865	2016-02-22T15:12:04	bermaniastudios you also studied hard, in  a course of study that’s demanding. GPA’s don’t matter IMHO, work ethic and skill does
Gartenberg	701786361045581824	2016-02-22T15:11:21	bermaniastudios I agree, college is a waste for most people Or get a degree that prepare you for life. I don’t think you majored in English
Gartenberg	701786085492465665	2016-02-22T15:10:15	bermaniastudios no sympathy for the CEO. But don’t work there looking for a dream. Take a job you might think is below your useless degree
