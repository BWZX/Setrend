NewRepublic	717037329756647425	2016-04-04T17:13:15	Thanks to HeerJeet for taking over our Twitter account! Here's his piece on TrumpFear:  
NewRepublic	717037292154695682	2016-04-04T17:13:07	At Princeton, Woodrow Wilson isn’t going anywhere.  
NewRepublic	717035111670218752	2016-04-04T17:04:27	Okay folks, that's a wrap. TrumpFear has left the building.
NewRepublic	717034860406243328	2016-04-04T17:03:27	Interesting point. I do think Trump use of xenophobia as entertainment is part of a tradition.  TrumpFear 
NewRepublic	717034120140947456	2016-04-04T17:00:30	emjayemjay Other way to look at it is Trumpism is attitude from those wars coming back to USA.
NewRepublic	717033894126727168	2016-04-04T16:59:36	Okay, about to bring TrumpFear to a close. Any last questions?
NewRepublic	717032975515430916	2016-04-04T16:55:57	NewRepublic FOmyronpitts I fear Islamophobia becomes a partisan issue (real bias vs "political correctness"). Eventually GOP wins, I lose
NewRepublic	717033581596557312	2016-04-04T16:58:22	That's true. Optimistically, I'd say that Islamophobia will generate opposition from many minority groups 
NewRepublic	717032652843393024	2016-04-04T16:54:40	That's true. Which is why Trump wasn't able to specialize.  
NewRepublic	717032115733454852	2016-04-04T16:52:32	On the question of Trump's xenophobia: I rest my case.  
NewRepublic	717031733091299328	2016-04-04T16:51:01	The problem with Bernie Sanders’s campaign was that he never thought he’d win.  
NewRepublic	717031601960534016	2016-04-04T16:50:30	Fair point. Although I worry that a shrewd future Trumpian could exploit, say, Islamophobia to divide &amp; conquer. 
NewRepublic	717030334148120577	2016-04-04T16:45:28	NewRepublic goethean Yes it will exist but as the country continues to change we will whittle away at that strongman demo.
NewRepublic	717030545595744257	2016-04-04T16:46:18	Interesting point.  
NewRepublic	717030417581346816	2016-04-04T16:45:47	2. That Trump faction might split with GOP this year if Trump not nominee but other candidates will solicit them in future.
NewRepublic	717030076756398081	2016-04-04T16:44:26	1. Even if Trump isn't nominee, he's energized a large faction of GOP (roughly a third of party). 
NewRepublic	717029635998003201	2016-04-04T16:42:41	Well, saying you won't admit a particular religion (as Trump did with Islam) is certainly xenophobic. TrumpFear 
NewRepublic	717029352538550277	2016-04-04T16:41:34	A future Trump could overcome demographics by being more selective &amp; target small unpopular minority TrumpFear 
NewRepublic	717028800115175424	2016-04-04T16:39:22	California looks like a good state for Trump. California GOP already went down xenophobia path years ago. TrumpFear 
NewRepublic	717028561908076544	2016-04-04T16:38:25	I think the best hope for this is through a revitalized union movement. But that'll take work. TrumpFear 
NewRepublic	717028069647728640	2016-04-04T16:36:28	I think this is true. Even if Trump fails (as I think he will) there is good chance of a Trumpist president later.  
NewRepublic	717027859538309120	2016-04-04T16:35:38	True. Obama as 1st black president (and larger cultural challenges to white supremacy) helped ignite this backlash.  
NewRepublic	717026057606443009	2016-04-04T16:28:28	NewRepublic In a lib-dem it would seem rather self-defeating to not accommodate in some manner the values and beliefs of large segment
NewRepublic	717027436014276609	2016-04-04T16:33:57	3. So Trumpism rose after Wallace voters joined GOP but also GOP elite abandoned even small policies benefitting white working class jbouie
NewRepublic	717027122162872320	2016-04-04T16:32:42	2. Nixon &amp; even Reagan style conservatism offered economic nationalism to white working class (Reagan had some protectionism).
NewRepublic	717026747108225024	2016-04-04T16:31:12	That's a fair point. In terms of chronology, the racial resentment did precede the economic concerns 
NewRepublic	717026481281622017	2016-04-04T16:30:09	1. Well, I think Nixon's great innovation was in co-opting Wallace message &amp; bringing those voters in. 
NewRepublic	717025990686412802	2016-04-04T16:28:12	Paleos &amp; Trumpists admire Putin's aggressive foreign policy (proof of manliness) &amp; Russia's demographic revival 
NewRepublic	717025711186382850	2016-04-04T16:27:05	I don't see how open racists &amp; xenophobes can be absorbed in political system as it stands, without huge damage. 
NewRepublic	717025267605225472	2016-04-04T16:25:20	Because of shared neo-liberalism of 2 parties, Wallace type voters now GOP, hence space for Trumpism. TrumpFear 
NewRepublic	717024945977573377	2016-04-04T16:24:03	True but those Long &amp; Wallace voters were mostly Democrats. Neo-liberalism allowed them to move to GOP TrumpFear 
NewRepublic	717024773893697536	2016-04-04T16:23:22	That's true but we also need to explain why Trumpism rose now. TrumpFear 
NewRepublic	717024236557217796	2016-04-04T16:21:14	NewRepublic HeerJeet I think this understates the degree to which the impulse behind Trumpism is a recurring part of 20th century US
NewRepublic	717024468854521857	2016-04-04T16:22:09	A fair point. Under white supremacy, white working class gets real rewards for their racial status. TrumpFear 
NewRepublic	717021327559933953	2016-04-04T16:09:40	Which ties into DougHenwood 3rd question: I think Bernie Sanders style populism has to be part of mix to defuse Trumpism. TrumpFear
NewRepublic	717021124656238592	2016-04-04T16:08:52	On DougHenwood's 2nd point, yes, I'd say Democrats shift to neo-liberalism opened space for Trumpism. TrumpFear
NewRepublic	717020744241266688	2016-04-04T16:07:21	Trump's political appeal to white working class is he promises to remedy both economic &amp; psychic dislocation.
NewRepublic	717020426333978624	2016-04-04T16:06:05	Traditionally in America, white supremacy or superiority is part of "wages of whiteness" -- i.e. psychic consolation white working class
NewRepublic	717020051778437121	2016-04-04T16:04:36	On DougHenwood first question: Trump's base is motivated by fusion of class &amp; race fears, economic displacement &amp; racist resentment.
