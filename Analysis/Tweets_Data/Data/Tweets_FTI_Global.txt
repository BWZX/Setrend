FTI_Global	692071388341899264	2016-01-26T19:47:31	Don Taylor: Current Fed’s track record is to try to calm markets by not raising rates when volatility rears up.  
FTI_Global	692057378166956032	2016-01-26T18:51:51	Don Taylor: I think Fed may be rattled by lukewarm US economy, market dips and postpone rate rises near term.
