jimtankersley	702508029800030208	2016-02-24T14:59:00	EricaGrieder BrendanNyhan All good points. But VP unquestionably makes him a nomination front-runner for POTUS in way gov doesn't.
jimtankersley	702506229214650368	2016-02-24T14:51:51	EricaGrieder BrendanNyhan and vice versa
jimtankersley	702506156573511680	2016-02-24T14:51:34	EricaGrieder BrendanNyhan The strategic upside for Cruz would rise if Rubio started to surge/Cruz dropped to clear 3rd.
jimtankersley	702499633860374529	2016-02-24T14:25:39	EricaGrieder BrendanNyhan So would you say Rubio/Cruz both see the other as more electable than Trump? (Or should?)

jimtankersley	702498279783862272	2016-02-24T14:20:16	BrendanNyhan But there, both men clearly believe they have better case to be on top of ticket.
jimtankersley	702498062946705409	2016-02-24T14:19:24	BrendanNyhan The obvious (strategy-only) deal here is for Rubio and Cruz to run on the same ticket.
jimtankersley	702497793584275456	2016-02-24T14:18:20	BrendanNyhan Take that with enormous grains of salt obvs
jimtankersley	702497744271876096	2016-02-24T14:18:08	BrendanNyhan Polls at least suggest big Nov advantage for Cruz over Trump. (And majority GOP voters say Trump has best chance to win)
jimtankersley	702497492315852801	2016-02-24T14:17:08	BrendanNyhan Right.
jimtankersley	702496596416733188	2016-02-24T14:13:34	BrendanNyhan Go on...
jimtankersley	702496073416359936	2016-02-24T14:11:30	Yes. I always wanted to be a Tenenbaum, you know? 
jimtankersley	702495395889471488	2016-02-24T14:08:48	BrendanNyhan ...and risk his counter-attacks, which could sink your campaign? Your pref is to beat him by sinking 3rd guy/taking his votes
jimtankersley	702495143446880257	2016-02-24T14:07:48	BrendanNyhan RIght. Tho you can extend to attacking Trump (which I might do in a follow up). Logic is, why be the 1 who attacks him...
jimtankersley	702494916476321792	2016-02-24T14:06:54	BrendanNyhan Because there's an argument that a Trump win is either Cruz or Rubio's second-best scenario.
jimtankersley	702494800738705409	2016-02-24T14:06:26	BrendanNyhan And appealing to either of them to drop out because "Trump might win if you stay" might not work...
jimtankersley	702494659927515136	2016-02-24T14:05:53	BrendanNyhan Logic is, Cruz/Rubio both have high incentive to stay in race long term, even if that raises odds of Trump win....
jimtankersley	702494339247808512	2016-02-24T14:04:36	Bottom line: Trump has a better chance of winning the longer Cruz/Rubio both stay in race. And the incentives are high for them to stay.
jimtankersley	702493587007741952	2016-02-24T14:01:37	BrendanNyhan That's the point. You play for the win now, even if it raises the chance of a Trump win, bc you don't fear Trump win so much
jimtankersley	702492932411170817	2016-02-24T13:59:01	Interesting but speculative  I'd still bet odds of win now &gt; P(Trump loss &amp; you get next nom) 
jimtankersley	702493278399283201	2016-02-24T14:00:23	Because the 'downside' of prolonging the race - poss Trump nomination - doesn't affect their utility same as it affects others in GOP.
jimtankersley	702492884315021312	2016-02-24T13:58:49	It's not that Rubio/Cruz have incentives to play for 2nd/Trump win, in that scenario. They just have more incent to stay in race. DCCyclone
jimtankersley	702491665605459968	2016-02-24T13:53:59	8) Then you have a whole new problem, and one that makes it much more likely for Trump to win nomination. 
jimtankersley	702491491348963329	2016-02-24T13:53:17	7) Same for Cruz, with Rubio.
jimtankersley	702491433572425729	2016-02-24T13:53:04	6) What if it's more in Rubio's interest for Trump to win than Cruz? Because a Trump win makes it more likely Rubio will someday be POTUS?
jimtankersley	702491119343509504	2016-02-24T13:51:49	5) My piece asks, what if that's not true?
jimtankersley	702491041610465282	2016-02-24T13:51:30	4) In other words, winning is everyone's first choice, stopping Trump from winning is everyone's second choice.
jimtankersley	702490940276142080	2016-02-24T13:51:06	3) For that to be true, though, you have to believe every non-Trump candidate wants Trump to lose, if that candidate can't win...
jimtankersley	702490719802544128	2016-02-24T13:50:13	2) Trump has long appeared to be a classic 'collective action problem' for GOP - everyone wants to stop him, but field unwilling to do it

jimtankersley	697848140381188096	2016-02-11T18:22:16	Huge caveat is TPC isn't modeling potential growth effects from Rubio's tax plan.
