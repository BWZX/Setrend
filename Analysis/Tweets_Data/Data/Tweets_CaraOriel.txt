CaraOriel	713377135252152320	2016-03-25T14:48:57	MarkGio1 FT perhaps if he were a cpa things would have evolved differently.

CaraOriel	711184321558794240	2016-03-19T13:35:30	DorsiaCapital let's go through them. I'll give you my sense.

CaraOriel	711183227210371072	2016-03-19T13:31:09	DorsiaCapital but i cannot think of someone fired for missing numbers in the 4/5 years of following like a hawk. I'd say unfortunately
CaraOriel	711181758126034944	2016-03-19T13:25:18	DorsiaCapital go to the authorities if you are ethical don't hoard cash
CaraOriel	711181684998336512	2016-03-19T13:25:01	DorsiaCapital relatively wealthy and hyper ethical.
CaraOriel	711181601124782080	2016-03-19T13:24:41	DorsiaCapital he was expecting to get a big payday in my opinion. I've thought about that guy a lot and the article depicting him as
CaraOriel	711181462133932033	2016-03-19T13:24:08	DorsiaCapital but yes the guy has balls. He got screwed - pretending to have had no clue as to Philidor practices however, bs
CaraOriel	711181179504959488	2016-03-19T13:23:00	DorsiaCapital unsure if that much I think he was pretty desperate and was told he would be included by the idiots at Philidor.
CaraOriel	711180752721985536	2016-03-19T13:21:19	DorsiaCapital no I don't think Mike would ever encourage that.  More like work as hard as I do.
CaraOriel	711180626855075840	2016-03-19T13:20:49	DorsiaCapital ah. Yeah I think there is likely truth to it. But like all things, something in btwn. Risk the company's solvency to make s?
CaraOriel	711180213980422144	2016-03-19T13:19:10	DorsiaCapital ah apologies let me read it and reply with wifi. Want to be thoughtful. Reitz is the Cali guy I guess.
CaraOriel	711179533882413056	2016-03-19T13:16:28	DorsiaCapital I'm so happy that I seem to be forgetting some of the names.
CaraOriel	711179467096514560	2016-03-19T13:16:12	DorsiaCapital I have terrible reception cannot open but I think I answered. I'm not sure about him and his motivations at all.

CaraOriel	711178823119851522	2016-03-19T13:13:39	DorsiaCapital I think there is a lot more to his personal finances then NYer reported. I also think he was very angry not to have been
CaraOriel	711178304720609280	2016-03-19T13:11:35	DorsiaCapital the California R+O guy?
CaraOriel	711178163011903488	2016-03-19T13:11:01	My list of lessons is so long already
CaraOriel	711177910619656192	2016-03-19T13:10:01	DorsiaCapital right now a lot of educated / motivated guesses.
CaraOriel	711177846501318657	2016-03-19T13:09:46	DorsiaCapital yes. In so many ways. I think the real education is far from over. A stock can trade at any price at anytime.
CaraOriel	711177476920184832	2016-03-19T13:08:18	DorsiaCapital I think we are waiting to better understand but if it was, by whom? I do not believe vrx CEO encouraged that at all.
CaraOriel	711176325583802368	2016-03-19T13:03:43	DorsiaCapital but without a doubt this has been a hell of a clusterf%ck
CaraOriel	711176152656842752	2016-03-19T13:03:02	DorsiaCapital brianfires Mike never sold a share. Intentional manipulation is very very hard to fathom. Why?
CaraOriel	711174371533058049	2016-03-19T12:55:57	DorsiaCapital brianfires worth raising in ire. I don't think Brian believes it is either. But of course you exclude nothing.
CaraOriel	711174250737049600	2016-03-19T12:55:29	DorsiaCapital brianfires no we can't exclude anything but I'm relatively sure that is not on the painfully long list of credible items
CaraOriel	711173123014586369	2016-03-19T12:51:00	DorsiaCapital just slid 2 generations to the right...
CaraOriel	711172504891613184	2016-03-19T12:48:32	brianfires ok. Diversions are important. Ciao.

CaraOriel	711171383208910848	2016-03-19T12:44:05	brianfires Brian + vrx = 
CaraOriel	711169913642209280	2016-03-19T12:38:14	brianfires I was talking the same apples you were in your vrx comment. But not important. Try to enjoy spring a bit. I know it's hard.
CaraOriel	711168379164479488	2016-03-19T12:32:09	brianfires I'm not particularly endeared but ok :-). Take a break from vrx maybe. Just a few hours. Trying to help.
CaraOriel	711167843912585216	2016-03-19T12:30:01	brianfires ok BRIAN. Ok. I was simply saying vrx "gaap cash flow" is not at issue, as far as I'm aware, differently from what you wrote.
CaraOriel	711167449937387520	2016-03-19T12:28:27	brianfires pls don't be sexist.
CaraOriel	711167215685476352	2016-03-19T12:27:31	brianfires is it a nice day there? Maybe chg of scenery? Here is piazza Del carmine. 
CaraOriel	711166852970504192	2016-03-19T12:26:05	brianfires vrx you are angry. That is very clear. And you have a right to be.
CaraOriel	711166691879862276	2016-03-19T12:25:26	brianfires vrx ok u r saying something different. fine. I'm just suggesting you itemize the real issues rather than tossing darts.
CaraOriel	711166342934732800	2016-03-19T12:24:03	brianfires vrx on the b/s is not real. If you attack the cash flow reporting which drives chg in cash you're saying the cash is false
CaraOriel	711166073350000640	2016-03-19T12:22:59	brianfires vrx not defending just correcting cash flow must tie to change in cash or you have true fraud. Nobody has suggested the cash
CaraOriel	711165800351186944	2016-03-19T12:21:54	brianfires vrx was presenting cash metrics that excluded restructuring costs etc because of large delta btwn eps and cf.
CaraOriel	711165345130803200	2016-03-19T12:20:05	brianfires Gaap earnings, not cash flow, are at issue
CaraOriel	711165211609317376	2016-03-19T12:19:33	brianfires what is bullshit, Brian?

CaraOriel	699647513222127616	2016-02-16T17:32:20	@GirlsCanTrade AndrewCuomoNews I agree. We don't know if he is religious he doesn't discuss it.

CaraOriel	699645334423785472	2016-02-16T17:23:41	@GirlsCanTrade AndrewCuomoNews Perhaps. But Scalia set aside religious views. The GOP is out of control. He is rolling in his grave.
CaraOriel	699645045725655046	2016-02-16T17:22:32	@GirlsCanTrade AndrewCuomoNews his best friend was Ruth Bader Ginsburg
CaraOriel	699644897045962752	2016-02-16T17:21:56	@GirlsCanTrade AndrewCuomoNews Scalia had integrity. He interpreted the constitution literally siding with both parties at times

CaraOriel	699644542597931008	2016-02-16T17:20:32	@GirlsCanTrade AndrewCuomoNews I think it is worth pointing out that not even Scalia would approve of their behavior
CaraOriel	699641889092431872	2016-02-16T17:09:59	@GirlsCanTrade AndrewCuomoNews the constitution gives Obama the right to appoint a new Supreme Court justice. That is the only point.
CaraOriel	699641665288605696	2016-02-16T17:09:06	@GirlsCanTrade AndrewCuomoNews about what you think of Scalia.
CaraOriel	699641604936744960	2016-02-16T17:08:51	@GirlsCanTrade AndrewCuomoNews I respect Scalia for his intellectual prowess independent of his views, but the point is absolutely not

CaraOriel	699641332478910469	2016-02-16T17:07:47	@GirlsCanTrade AndrewCuomoNews I don't agree with many of scalia's views. But the point is not that. It is the opposite. Republicans

CaraOriel	694769279418421248	2016-02-03T06:27:59	DorsiaCapital well, that is an operation that went rogue to what extent I don't know. I strongly believe Mike was shocked by it.

CaraOriel	694720239112732672	2016-02-03T03:13:06	DorsiaCapital common. He never made a billion. Rent, staff, distribution.......
CaraOriel	694719856030150656	2016-02-03T03:11:35	DorsiaCapital gotta work. Will educate myself more later.
CaraOriel	694719789625909248	2016-02-03T03:11:19	DorsiaCapital which is a fact. No investor ever got a dividend. He lives humbly wu-tang album aside
CaraOriel	694719633056780288	2016-02-03T03:10:42	DorsiaCapital and then what he doesn't say is reinvesting every penny in r&amp;d
CaraOriel	694719501456252928	2016-02-03T03:10:11	DorsiaCapital but look at what he did with profits. 60% r+d to sales.
CaraOriel	694719287408328704	2016-02-03T03:09:20	DorsiaCapital I saw
CaraOriel	694719164678828033	2016-02-03T03:08:50	DorsiaCapital one could make a legitimate case that he is not worthy of scrutiny.
CaraOriel	694719052808331264	2016-02-03T03:08:24	DorsiaCapital absolutely.
CaraOriel	694718958532980736	2016-02-03T03:08:01	DorsiaCapital always two sides to every story.
CaraOriel	694718911456092160	2016-02-03T03:07:50	DorsiaCapital he gave away 70% of volumes for free.
CaraOriel	694718844347269120	2016-02-03T03:07:34	DorsiaCapital he invested heavily to reformulate it so as to cut down or eliminate the massively troublesome side effects.
CaraOriel	694718666605203456	2016-02-03T03:06:52	DorsiaCapital you know, shkreli is quite arrogant but he plowed all profits into r+d and bought the drug that was very unsafe.
CaraOriel	694718389059743744	2016-02-03T03:05:45	DorsiaCapital no. I think it was a confluence of multiple factors. Hedge fund hotel made it a particularly attractive target.
CaraOriel	694718146834513920	2016-02-03T03:04:48	DorsiaCapital yes. Stands to reason.
CaraOriel	694717916391038978	2016-02-03T03:03:53	DorsiaCapital ah I'm multi-tasking. I'll take a look in a half hour.
CaraOriel	694717760778190850	2016-02-03T03:03:16	DorsiaCapital PA? Are there emails and to who. I am certain Mike had no idea that Philidor was engaging in questionable practices.
CaraOriel	694717438886305792	2016-02-03T03:01:59	DorsiaCapital yes
CaraOriel	694717373639692289	2016-02-03T03:01:43	DorsiaCapital it's my recall that Mike would go through every single number and find mistakes and sit in excel himself.
CaraOriel	694717157922443264	2016-02-03T03:00:52	DorsiaCapital I think a strategic genius with 200% commitment to the company is an apt professional description.
CaraOriel	694716758763118593	2016-02-03T02:59:17	DorsiaCapital let them respond tomorrow or tonight. Let's see if I'm at all on target.
CaraOriel	694716597647339520	2016-02-03T02:58:38	DorsiaCapital Mike was Ceo CFO business development accounting, etc. I rely on nothing anyone else says.
CaraOriel	694715900520435712	2016-02-03T02:55:52	DorsiaCapital per the banker?
CaraOriel	694715704927457283	2016-02-03T02:55:05	DorsiaCapital he does swallow his words and is an introvert. A high integrity businessman whose strategy has enraged a lot of ppl.
CaraOriel	694715459262898176	2016-02-03T02:54:07	DorsiaCapital I have witnessed a level of precision that goes above and beyond necessary. That analogy is laughable.
CaraOriel	694715070023102465	2016-02-03T02:52:34	DorsiaCapital sure.... Long term weighing machine
CaraOriel	694714963894599680	2016-02-03T02:52:09	DorsiaCapital :-)
CaraOriel	694704990829572096	2016-02-03T02:12:31	DorsiaCapital I try to be objective and believe I am. I'm not blinded by having know the people. I both bought and sold because I know them
CaraOriel	694704798566912001	2016-02-03T02:11:45	DorsiaCapital sorry those thoughts are a bit all over the place. Twitter is not the ideal format to express a number of reactions.

CaraOriel	694704383167184896	2016-02-03T02:10:06	DorsiaCapital but often not. Lastly, a critique. Valeant needs a deeper bench. To the extent a calc error was made, it is a reflection
CaraOriel	694704193563709440	2016-02-03T02:09:21	DorsiaCapital I found it hard to follow the references to price increases because sometimes they were explicitly indicated as gross or net
CaraOriel	694703895361241088	2016-02-03T02:08:10	DorsiaCapital 6) Evercore is really smart. I have not seen their piece. I would want to see what Rohit says, he is objective and detailed
CaraOriel	694703643312922624	2016-02-03T02:07:10	DorsiaCapital 5) Mike Pearson, love or hate him, does not lie.  He is paid 0 salary and has his entire net worth in the company.
CaraOriel	694703463897382912	2016-02-03T02:06:27	DorsiaCapital 4) I do not know Howard personally but he was my partners boss at Goldman Sachs and has tremendous integrity
CaraOriel	694703318006919168	2016-02-03T02:05:52	DorsiaCapital 3) as Salix is part of the company the price/vol mix changes drastically with each week. Dates apples 2 apples?
