chrisnelder	717535706231353344	2016-04-06T02:13:38	AloysiusFekete drvox Apparently not. ;-)
chrisnelder	717511188582518784	2016-04-06T00:36:12	Thanks to the price slump, the cost of halting all new coal &amp; gas projects in Oz is now A$290m vs. A$1.5bn in 2013. 
chrisnelder	717499256760721408	2016-04-05T23:48:47	ericgarland masoninman While EVs played almost no role at all. So all the simple narratives were wrong &amp; nobody offered a better one.
chrisnelder	717499028879974400	2016-04-05T23:47:53	ericgarland masoninman And it got people saving rather than spending, changed their travel &amp; living patterns. Gas prices were late effect.
chrisnelder	717498738852245504	2016-04-05T23:46:44	ericgarland masoninman Personally, I think that's the smoking gun here. It depressed vehicle sales 2008/9/10, which then bounced hard.
chrisnelder	717498570484482048	2016-04-05T23:46:04	ericgarland As masoninman observed, the recession always seems to get left out of the popular narratives...like it never happened.
chrisnelder	717498457137655808	2016-04-05T23:45:37	ericgarland masoninman Fully agree on that (and wasn't entirely sure what point you were making).
chrisnelder	717497772983787520	2016-04-05T23:42:54	ericgarland Yes, VMT is an important tell here...and does correlate well with fuel prices.
chrisnelder	717490690456850433	2016-04-05T23:14:45	ericgarland I'm not a fan of annualizing sales from a single month. Full year data is better and 17.5m in 2015 kinda says it all.

chrisnelder	717433825660284929	2016-04-05T19:28:47	alexqgb Just bear in mind that 99,000 luxury vehicles was 0.6% of the 2015 U.S. light duty vehicle market.

chrisnelder	715734603340713984	2016-04-01T02:56:41	andrew_leach Oh, undoubtedly. I'm not even talking about other options right now...just the cost of CO2. CCS would be my last choice.
chrisnelder	715734160128679938	2016-04-01T02:54:56	Oh, and the CO2 pricing model I speak of? Right here: 
chrisnelder	715733982894108672	2016-04-01T02:54:13	So...if carbon were anywhere near accurately priced (let's say $200/tonne and up) then CCS would pencil out. But who'd price CO2 accurately?
chrisnelder	715733716610326528	2016-04-01T02:53:10	FWIW, I'm only aware of one price schedule that even comes close to $125/tonne for CO2, and that's an outlier model (but a good one).
chrisnelder	715729181359939584	2016-04-01T02:35:09	To make CCS work, TransAlta needed $30/tonne credit for sequestration, $30/tonne in CO2 sales for EOR, and a $65/tonne subsidy from govt.

chrisnelder	712018561292611586	2016-03-21T20:50:28	So, at a (low) $2/MMBtu and $1m/mile, North Dakota has been flaring enough gas to pay for 248 miles of pipeline per year. But nooooo.

chrisnelder	711370690620817408	2016-03-20T01:56:03	drvox Right. Divide the 2008 number by 15, and that's what it actually was back then. bserrurier taykuy

chrisnelder	711350326381547521	2016-03-20T00:35:08	drvox taykuy You have to "split-adjust" your numbers. So your $1,079/sh in 2011 a) was not the peak, and b) is wrong by a factor of 15.
chrisnelder	711349967948898304	2016-03-20T00:33:43	drvox taykuy Once again: It means split. There was a 1-for-15 reverse split on Sep 30, 2015. So actual price on Jun 27, 2008 peak was $84,
chrisnelder	711295253332930560	2016-03-19T20:56:18	drvox taykuy You have to look a little harder and understand the meaning of that little purple S at the bottom. BTU peaked at $84.
chrisnelder	711290641418858497	2016-03-19T20:37:58	taykuy drvox Actually a 1-for-15 reverse split on Sep 30, 2015...so call it $84 at the Jun 27, 2008 peak, yes?

chrisnelder	710248722374852608	2016-03-16T23:37:45	bradplumer A_H_Goldstein There are a lot of thorny questions in there, usually elided in favor of a pleasing narrative about efficiency.
chrisnelder	710248275304062976	2016-03-16T23:35:59	bradplumer A_H_Goldstein Does less labor per unit of manufacturing output increase or reduce electricity use? Not sure.
chrisnelder	710248111570956288	2016-03-16T23:35:20	bradplumer A_H_Goldstein Don't know. More efficient motors, sure, but also more electricity-using robots...
chrisnelder	710247564935757825	2016-03-16T23:33:09	bradplumer Then you'd want to find a different metric than GDP before you started making claims about efficiency...
chrisnelder	710247196126420992	2016-03-16T23:31:41	A_H_Goldstein bradplumer Possible. Also: De-industrializing &amp; offshoring.

chrisnelder	708335150409523200	2016-03-11T16:53:54	JonFerris2 Well PPChef has written quite a bit on that data, for example  
chrisnelder	708323613544321024	2016-03-11T16:08:04	JonFerris2 Germany could make that happen in an instant by eliminating electricity exports. But the real world is complicated.

chrisnelder	708321360154525697	2016-03-11T15:59:06	JonFerris2 Right. A temporary reversal in a long-running transition. But that's not the story that anti-Energiewende folks were telling.
chrisnelder	708318899184336898	2016-03-11T15:49:20	JonFerris2 Except Germany's decision to phase out nuclear, and renewables replacing nuclear, preceded Fukushima.

chrisnelder	703667600757100544	2016-02-27T19:46:44	bradplumer But that seems so obvious I suspect that's not what you were asking...
chrisnelder	703667510797688833	2016-02-27T19:46:22	bradplumer OK, so: vs. biking or not taking the trip: Avg CO2/mi * (avg miles to pick up fare + length of trip)

chrisnelder	702224127189385216	2016-02-23T20:10:53	chrishelman Which is not to say that the next cycle won't favor small shale E&amp;Ps. It could. But that's pure speculation at this point.

chrisnelder	702223755339108352	2016-02-23T20:09:24	chrishelman A possible thesis, but right now the evidence says that deep-pocketed E&amp;Ps pursuing the megaprojects are the survivors.
chrisnelder	702222664488787968	2016-02-23T20:05:04	chrishelman That would be the same Mark Papa whose company is now down to one rig in North Dakota.

chrisnelder	694573417773666304	2016-02-02T17:29:42	davidgaffen I think only the deep-pocketed supermajors can even think about expanding market share right now, so it's opportunistic.
chrisnelder	694570457874345985	2016-02-02T17:17:56	davidgaffen Personally, I am surprised their capex cuts haven't been deeper. Looks like they're aiming to drill for higher  market share.
chrisnelder	694569420581015552	2016-02-02T17:13:48	davidgaffen You expected larger capex cuts to maintain higher buyback rate?

chrisnelder	691750239946977281	2016-01-25T22:31:23	maoxian Terrible harvests in Italy the past few years only give Cali even more of an edge... 
chrisnelder	691749923180515328	2016-01-25T22:30:08	maoxian Thanks. Yes it's a burgeoning industry...I've watched olive trees getting planted all over Sonoma for the past 15 yrs or so.
chrisnelder	691747910292082688	2016-01-25T22:22:08	Or, as I wrote almost 6 years ago: Peak demand, yes; but not the nice kind.  
chrisnelder	691746540604432384	2016-01-25T22:16:41	BrattleStCap That's right. There are any number of ways to make a comparison, and they all have plusses and minuses...including WTI.
chrisnelder	691745472420012032	2016-01-25T22:12:27	BrattleStCap EddyElfenbein They are. But the magnitudes are different so it's hard to see. Is this better? 
chrisnelder	691740908874665984	2016-01-25T21:54:19	EddyElfenbein Long term, the correlation is usually close. Gaps get closed. Why should it be different now? 
chrisnelder	691737455058243584	2016-01-25T21:40:35	EddyElfenbein What's your reasoning for that?
chrisnelder	691737171057725440	2016-01-25T21:39:28	ToddSullivan EddyElfenbein ?? Returning to close correlation WAS the mean reversion.

chrisnelder	691705212222898176	2016-01-25T19:32:28	jdmarkman howardlindzon Time to revive QUITR?
chrisnelder	691704795732639744	2016-01-25T19:30:49	stacey_mc27 Ed_Crooks That makes sense. Thanks Stacey.
chrisnelder	691704088782721024	2016-01-25T19:28:00	JeffALewis Ed_Crooks That's a different question. My question is: Is it reservoir damage, or just project damage?
chrisnelder	691703551639224321	2016-01-25T19:25:52	JeffALewis Ed_Crooks It would just mean that you'd need to pump in extra heat on restart to motivate the additional fluid.
chrisnelder	691703250202943488	2016-01-25T19:24:40	JeffALewis Ed_Crooks That was my guess: You'd wind up with cold, watery bitumen downhole. But I wouldn't consider that "reservoir damage"
chrisnelder	691701751079006208	2016-01-25T19:18:43	Ed_Crooks Yes but I had always imagined e.g., SAGD happening in a clay/sand formation, where rigidity was low &amp; fracturing rare.
chrisnelder	691700655413526528	2016-01-25T19:14:22	Ed_Crooks Huh. I hadn't heard that before...didn't realize that fracturing was so much of an issue with tar sands. Thanks.
chrisnelder	691700117980581888	2016-01-25T19:12:13	Ed_Crooks Hm. Are you sure that shutting down an in-situ project actually damages the reservoir (and not just the equipment/project)?

chrisnelder	691446883823136769	2016-01-25T02:25:58	sharethesolar I think it would be a waste of a PV asset to heat water with them.

chrisnelder	691338901089177600	2016-01-24T19:16:53	JasonBordoff Right. As I said earlier to Ed_Crooks, I'm done with the Kabuki theatre of characterizations. Just cite the data &amp; stop there

chrisnelder	691306143373774850	2016-01-24T17:06:43	Ed_Crooks andrew_leach I think that's right Ed. We just have to wait &amp; find out exactly what kind of rebound shale can do...
chrisnelder	691305995780386818	2016-01-24T17:06:07	andrew_leach Ed_Crooks But there's a limit to those too...can't revive a dead horse.
chrisnelder	691305616514641920	2016-01-24T17:04:37	andrew_leach Ed_Crooks Stripper wells are arguably the fastest and most responsive to crank up...IF you do them at the right time.
chrisnelder	691305385035218944	2016-01-24T17:03:42	andrew_leach Ed_Crooks What's "resilient" or "faster" or "responsive" or "significant" or...? It's all just narrative.
chrisnelder	691305043476226049	2016-01-24T17:02:20	andrew_leach Ed_Crooks Which is why I prefer to stick to the data than work with characterizations. Is it bigger than a breadbox?
chrisnelder	691304800324050944	2016-01-24T17:01:22	Ed_Crooks If all you're doing is ramping up/down rigs &amp; fracking gear, then yeah, it's more responsive. But I think we're past that pt now.
chrisnelder	691304548850335744	2016-01-24T17:00:22	Ed_Crooks In reality, it takes years to secure leases, build up capital, production assets, labor, offtake capacity, etc.
chrisnelder	691304269006376965	2016-01-24T16:59:16	Ed_Crooks We don't really know what it can do. And it's only "a matter of months" if you start the clock when a drill rig show up.
chrisnelder	691304070091554817	2016-01-24T16:58:28	Ed_Crooks The assertion that US supply can rebound nimbly when prices rise again is more industry propaganda than historical fact IMO.

chrisnelder	685485890194419712	2016-01-08T15:39:06	bradplumer But yes - far too early to say. This is just a glimmer of an idea so far, from what I can tell.
