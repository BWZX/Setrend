ATMcharts	688084115971780608	2016-01-15T19:43:31	jstrauss right, which leads us to (at least) a cyclical bear market vs the typical recent bull market correction

ATMcharts	687721029645529088	2016-01-14T19:40:45	jstrauss for sure.  It's a legit concern that will limit buying.  We should write a post...
ATMcharts	687720464320466944	2016-01-14T19:38:30	jstrauss we should make a list

ATMcharts	687719969157693442	2016-01-14T19:36:32	jstrauss i care less about multiples and more about business trajectory right now...mainly because so many have gone south..
ATMcharts	687719648956157952	2016-01-14T19:35:16	jstrauss this is a hard market.  200 has been a decent reference point though. Lots of panic breadth.  I bought 201s. We'll see how it goes
ATMcharts	687718892169486336	2016-01-14T19:32:15	jstrauss sure, absolutely.  And if that is the case instead of 20% off the high we could see something like 50-60% off.
ATMcharts	687718488589340672	2016-01-14T19:30:39	jstrauss don't get me wrong.  I think you are correct if lower valuations are coming
ATMcharts	687717838874931200	2016-01-14T19:28:04	jstrauss interesting take.  I guess I wonder why multiples will contract?  Especially if long term yields drop.
