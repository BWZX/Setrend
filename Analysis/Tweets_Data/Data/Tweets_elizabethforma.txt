elizabethforma	722536265430777858	2016-04-19T21:24:04	Hey TedCruz: Maybe you should spend less time complaining about your "significant sacrifices" - &amp; more time doing something about theirs.
elizabethforma	722536176532471809	2016-04-19T21:23:43	You chose to run for President, TedCruz. You chose to make your “sacrifices.” Working people don't have a choice.
elizabethforma	722536059020644352	2016-04-19T21:23:15	They don't throw tantrums or try to shut down their workplace because they don't get their way - &amp; then turn around &amp; demand promotions.
elizabethforma	722535920612872192	2016-04-19T21:22:42	And TedCruz? Working people work more, get paid less, can't save, get mistreated, struggle with illness &amp; family - but they don't whine.
elizabethforma	722535807047835652	2016-04-19T21:22:15	Know who’s facing "constant attacks," TedCruz? Hardworking American immigrants, Muslims, LGBT folks, women. Your constant attacks.
elizabethforma	722535675594149888	2016-04-19T21:21:43	Know who gets no family time, TedCruz? Moms w/ unfair schedules who drop kids at daycare &amp; find their hrs cancelled. GOP won't help.
elizabethforma	722535559911051264	2016-04-19T21:21:16	Know who gets no personal time? People who work 2 min wage jobs to support their families. TedCruz opposes giving them a raise.
elizabethforma	722535430000943104	2016-04-19T21:20:45	Know whose sleep is limited? Working parents who stay up worrying about getting kids thru college w/o big debt. TedCruz blocked refi.
elizabethforma	722535329949958145	2016-04-19T21:20:21	Know whose health is limited? Workers w/ no paid leave who can't stay home when sick or caring for kids. TedCruz won't support it.
elizabethforma	722535212601765888	2016-04-19T21:19:53	Are you kidding me, TedCruz? We’re supposed to pity you because trying to be the leader of the free world is hard?! 2 words: Boo hoo.
elizabethforma	722535080758009856	2016-04-19T21:19:21	.TedCruz whined about facing constant attacks, nonexistent family time, limited health and sleep, and no personal time.
elizabethforma	722534798032506880	2016-04-19T21:18:14	Yesterday TedCruz sent a campaign email whining about the “significant sacrifice” he’s made to run for President. 
elizabethforma	719194493384290305	2016-04-10T16:05:03	Does the front page of the BostonGlobe Ideas section scare you? It should.  
elizabethforma	718219179803996160	2016-04-07T23:29:30	Read my new BostonGlobe op-ed telling Senate_GOPs to doyourjob. 
elizabethforma	718218999524364288	2016-04-07T23:28:48	.Senate_GOPs can start proving they can govern responsibly by doing their jobs &amp; considering POTUS's nominee to the Supreme Court.
elizabethforma	718218883866435584	2016-04-07T23:28:20	If the Senate_GOPs don't like having to pick between Donald Trump &amp; Ted Cruz, they should stand up to extremists in their party.

elizabethforma	712002249271197696	2016-03-21T19:45:39	We cannot elect wannabe tyrants to the White House. Not now, not ever. It’s up to all of us us to stop realDonaldTrump .
elizabethforma	712002109277872128	2016-03-21T19:45:05	.RealDonaldTrump is “cool with being called an authoritarian,” isn't upset at Hitler comparisons &amp; thinks we won’t fight back? WRONG!
elizabethforma	712001961822965760	2016-03-21T19:44:30	Why is it that realDonaldTrump can call himself the “unity” candidate while basing his campaign on racism, sexism, xenophobia &amp; hatred?
elizabethforma	711951221490372609	2016-03-21T16:22:53	The way I see it, it’s our job to make sure realDonaldTrump ends this campaign every bit the loser that he started it.
elizabethforma	711951101524840448	2016-03-21T16:22:24	Many of history’s worst authoritarians started out as losers – and realDonaldTrump is a serious threat.
elizabethforma	711951004749664256	2016-03-21T16:22:01	.RealDonaldTrump stands ready to tear apart an America that was built on values like decency, community, and concern for our neighbors.
elizabethforma	711950874428497920	2016-03-21T16:21:30	But just because realDonaldTrump is a loser everywhere else doesn’t mean he’ll lose this election.
elizabethforma	711950735798304768	2016-03-21T16:20:57	.RealDonaldTrump knows he’s a loser. His insecurities are on parade: petty bullying, attacks on women, cheap racism, flagrant narcissism.
elizabethforma	711950632857550848	2016-03-21T16:20:32	Listen to experts who say realDonaldTrump might have more money today if he’d put his inheritance in an index fund &amp; left it alone.
elizabethforma	711950468369539073	2016-03-21T16:19:53	See how realDonaldTrump kept his father’s empire afloat using strategic corporate bankruptcies to skip out on debt.
elizabethforma	711950372051558400	2016-03-21T16:19:30	Let’s be honest - realDonaldTrump is a loser. Count all his failed businesses. See how he cheated people w/ scams like Trump U.
elizabethforma	711568869551247360	2016-03-20T15:03:33	People ask me whether I regret my big decision, but it's too late: I'm here again at the BostonStPats breakfast. 
elizabethforma	704169916060946432	2016-02-29T05:02:45	And no Best Picture award, but TheBigShort made clear we will not forget that Wall St broke our economy. This ain't over. Oscars

elizabethforma	685510117048119301	2016-01-08T17:15:22	This is business as usual for Wall Street and Washington insiders, and it stinks.
elizabethforma	685510044495024129	2016-01-08T17:15:05	Not sure what’s more disgusting: That Jeb is pinning his 2016 hopes on his bro’s bailout $, or that bailed-out CEOs want to buy elections.
elizabethforma	685509950504833024	2016-01-08T17:14:43	And now, Greenberg is giving $10 million of his AIG fortune to try to save Jeb Bush’s dying Presidential campaign. 
elizabethforma	685509801498009601	2016-01-08T17:14:07	Once his GOP friends left office, Greenberg sued the Obama Administration because – get this – the bailout wasn’t generous enough for him…
elizabethforma	685509700251742210	2016-01-08T17:13:43	Hank Greenberg left his company just before AIG took a $182 billion bailout from the Bush Administration…
elizabethforma	685509624666144768	2016-01-08T17:13:25	Let's get this straight: CEO Hank Greenberg ran AIG as it recklessly gambled on mortgage-backed securities...
elizabethforma	684776792943652864	2016-01-06T16:41:24	I'm glad that ALL the Dem candidates for president – HillaryClinton, BernieSanders &amp; MartinOMalley – are fighting for Wall St reform.
elizabethforma	684753886285029378	2016-01-06T15:10:23	We need to level the playing field and end too big to fail.
elizabethforma	684753840718090240	2016-01-06T15:10:12	I'm glad BernieSanders is out there fighting to hold big banks accountable, make our economy safer, &amp; stop the GOP from rigging the system.
elizabethforma	684753760325910528	2016-01-06T15:09:53	But the 2016 Republicans claim they'll repeal all the new financial regulations – hoping to be chosen as Wall Street's favorite candidate.
elizabethforma	684753630969335809	2016-01-06T15:09:22	11 big banks are still so risky that if any one started to fail, they'd need a gov bailout or risk taking down the economy – again.

elizabethforma	673879558035218432	2015-12-07T14:59:41	I agree with HillaryClinton: “President Obama &amp; congressional Democrats should do everything they can to stop these efforts.”
elizabethforma	673879136499290112	2015-12-07T14:58:00	.HillaryClinton is right to fight GOP efforts to sneak financial reform rollbacks into the funding bill.
