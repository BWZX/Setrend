NelsonSchwartz	698246087216386048	2016-02-12T20:43:34	retheauditors I know you disagree re fiduciary duty - that's a secondary point. What do you think companies under pressure now should do?
NelsonSchwartz	698245485493166085	2016-02-12T20:41:11	retheauditors They gave up because they lost a shareholder vote. Timken had done well - beat S&amp;P - but not well enough for the activists.
NelsonSchwartz	698243460474789888	2016-02-12T20:33:08	retheauditors Timken fought the activists - hard - and lost. I'm not sure they had a choice.
NelsonSchwartz	698243018248364033	2016-02-12T20:31:22	retheauditors My Timken story was 4,371 words - everyone's quoted, from workers and suppliers to execs and activists. What is your point?
NelsonSchwartz	698241259903778816	2016-02-12T20:24:23	retheauditors I guess DuPont, Xerox,and all the other companies that basically gave in to activists just didn't understand the rules.

NelsonSchwartz	581523608108929025	2015-03-27T18:30:07	ssupak DeanBaker13 Exports are up, which helps growth. Just because imports are up too doesn't change that.
