CramersShirt	716986095385206784	2016-04-04T13:49:40	34bps did you see how that all started
CramersShirt	716984398801870848	2016-04-04T13:42:56	34bps ok, how would determine the size of a city?
CramersShirt	716982875824861184	2016-04-04T13:36:53	34bps so then take JAX land area and find Miami, TB, Orlando... It's not that hard
CramersShirt	716982674401861632	2016-04-04T13:36:05	34bps look at the land area..JAX is 25% larger than HOU
CramersShirt	716982317227442176	2016-04-04T13:34:39	34bps have you been to JAX? I lived an hour and a half way for 3 years. Or 45 minutes to "Welcome to JAX?"
CramersShirt	716979540887674880	2016-04-04T13:23:38	Maybe let's see if he actually has the capacity to fill these orders.

CramersShirt	716978472598376448	2016-04-04T13:19:23	34bps I never said population didn't matter, I said JAX population is distorted by the sheer size of land area of city boundary

CramersShirt	716971034201559040	2016-04-04T12:49:49	34bps michaelsantoli no, it's the best, JAX is "biggest" because of sheer land mass and amount of people it encompasses
CramersShirt	716969085762822145	2016-04-04T12:42:05	Booooo 
CramersShirt	716967206295183360	2016-04-04T12:34:37	34bps michaelsantoli by land, JAX might be biggest in country, population counts is what matters. Chicago will be 4th soon enough.
