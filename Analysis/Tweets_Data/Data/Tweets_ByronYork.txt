ByronYork	720955730895978496	2016-04-15T12:43:35	So from there Trump went to WI, made mistake attacking Walker, ran into wall of talk radio opposition, made epic blunder on abortion.

ByronYork	720955566366015492	2016-04-15T12:42:56	Problem was not that one tweet could bring Trump down; NeverTrumpers had long abandoned that hope.
