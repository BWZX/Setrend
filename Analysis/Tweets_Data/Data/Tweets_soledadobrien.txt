soledadobrien	725524846398988288	2016-04-28T03:19:37	.soledadobrien andrewkolodny Treatment of underlying issues &amp; some honesty. In addicted teens' own words:

soledadobrien	725518542708330496	2016-04-28T02:54:34	soledadobrien Thank you Soledad for asking me great questions and for helping raise awareness about opioid addiction epidemic.
soledadobrien	725518991335124992	2016-04-28T02:56:21	Bentonville Film Festival.  
soledadobrien	725518386768175106	2016-04-28T02:53:57	Big thanks to Dr. Andrew Kolodny (from Phoenix House) andrewkolodny   Appreciate it.
soledadobrien	725518064389787648	2016-04-28T02:52:40	But rehab is sooo expensive and often fails the first several times... 
soledadobrien	725517533248266240	2016-04-28T02:50:34	andrewkolodny final question: what has to chg to end this epidemic?
soledadobrien	725517002484387840	2016-04-28T02:48:27	soledadobrien True. The response to crack cocaine epidemic &amp; heroin in 70s was war on drugs (&amp; users).
soledadobrien	725516374030864384	2016-04-28T02:45:57	soledadobrien More than 4 out 5 heroin users developed opioid addiction from pills before switching to heroin.
soledadobrien	725516462857711618	2016-04-28T02:46:18	Ugh 
soledadobrien	725516355366060032	2016-04-28T02:45:53	andrewkolodny seems like local law enforcement became more compassionate to addicts when problems shifted to suburban whites. True?
soledadobrien	725515993519415297	2016-04-28T02:44:26	soledadobrien Short rehab stays and detox don't work well. Long-term treatment required. Treatment with buprenorphine (Suboxone) helps many
soledadobrien	725515762132115457	2016-04-28T02:43:31	andrewkolodny What percentage of heroin addicts started as rx pill addicts ?
soledadobrien	725514931269984257	2016-04-28T02:40:13	soledadobrien mattdpearce We're in the midst of the worst drug addiction epidemic in US history. More than 250,000 OD deaths since 1999.
soledadobrien	725515302335877120	2016-04-28T02:41:42	soledadobrien The opioid addiction epidemic was caused by overexposing US population to Rx opioids.
soledadobrien	725515331968495616	2016-04-28T02:41:49	andrewkolodny Are there known effective treatments for opioid addicts? Many i've interviewed were in rehab 10-12 times. Or more.
soledadobrien	725514952358797313	2016-04-28T02:40:18	andrewkolodny ASAM says 48k lethal drug overdoses. How much of this problem linked to over prescribing of rx drugs?
soledadobrien	725514200148123648	2016-04-28T02:37:19	mattdpearce andrewkolodny is the expert on this.  I'm twitter-interviewing you, Doctor. How bad is this opioid problem in the US right now
soledadobrien	725511414677282817	2016-04-28T02:26:15	mattdpearce that nimber is lethal drug over doses. More than 18k overdoses from rx drugs. More than 10k heroin overdoses. Epidemic
soledadobrien	725508386125545472	2016-04-28T02:14:13	47,055 people died of opioid overdose in 2014.

soledadobrien	725305483746111488	2016-04-27T12:47:57	Well--the silver lining is racism and discrimination have kept opioid/heroin addiction among blacks lower.

soledadobrien	710468224886898688	2016-03-17T14:09:59	OK, that‚Äôs enough for now
soledadobrien	710467634626605058	2016-03-17T14:07:38	15) Instead, the "change-nothing" faction has lost control of their own presidential nomination. We‚Äôll see what more there is left to lose.
soledadobrien	710466759661363200	2016-03-17T14:04:09	14) The dominant faction on my side of the argument, however, has insisted that it can win all, by changing none.
soledadobrien	710466088509767680	2016-03-17T14:01:29	13) I‚Äôve spent a lot of time being dismissed as a RINO squish, or worse, because I think to save most of conservatism, we must change some.
soledadobrien	710465571435978752	2016-03-17T13:59:26	12) Yet even as the R elite sees what‚Äôs probably coming, it won‚Äôt believe it. What worked in 1980 must work again. It just *must*.
soledadobrien	710464981708492800	2016-03-17T13:57:06	11) The big clarifying election Ryan yearns for is much more likely to consolidate D control than R control- as he must see.
soledadobrien	710464793707200512	2016-03-17T13:56:21	10) But (as Ryan told Harwood), desperately as GOP elites seek an escape, they cannot see it. They will allow themselves to be dragged
soledadobrien	710464344136523777	2016-03-17T13:54:34	9) Trump being a candidate whom most Republicans elite regard as a Goldwater-style disaster who will drag whole party to defeat after him
soledadobrien	710464091299717120	2016-03-17T13:53:33	8) So as GOP generals stood at Armageddon to battle for the Lord, i.e. Reagan, their troops were deserting to Donald Trump
soledadobrien	710463624171622400	2016-03-17T13:51:42	7) The problem was, that the Republican leadership‚Äôs version of a right turn - Paul Ryan‚Äôs version - was not what the base had in mind

soledadobrien	708707953570926592	2016-03-12T17:35:17	Coming April 21st... 
soledadobrien	709440662261866496	2016-03-14T18:06:49	Ah then our tweets crossed. Apologies. Appreciate the love. Xo 
soledadobrien	709434253549801473	2016-03-14T17:41:21	Yes--I bet!  Good luck w the radio show.  
soledadobrien	709390597057024000	2016-03-14T14:47:52	Should have been more clear: your point is accurate. But it's not the conversation you jumped into.  
soledadobrien	709390166843125760	2016-03-14T14:46:10	Tony4Ray I can think of a bunch of well-off black people who'll regale you of stories of police interactions that were terrifying.
soledadobrien	709389476385181696	2016-03-14T14:43:25	Thanks for the interview. Have a great day  
soledadobrien	709389410069057538	2016-03-14T14:43:09	Oh--thanks!! That show was 'ahead of its time' (cancelled!) lol. Thanks re: GS piece. I've had a lot of fun gigs 
soledadobrien	709387943002181632	2016-03-14T14:37:20	soledadobrien As a largely irish white guy, I did better with "How the Irish Became White", by Ignatiev.  Helps to know who you are.
soledadobrien	709388799760007168	2016-03-14T14:40:44	But many of our favorite companies do exactly this--and we love and support them. So contradictory, yes?  
soledadobrien	709388529311338497	2016-03-14T14:39:39	Literally--to not be oppressed is a sort of privilege, actually.  
soledadobrien	709388040146436097	2016-03-14T14:37:43	Not sure I'm understanding you 
soledadobrien	709387735518351360	2016-03-14T14:36:30	Oh yes--I agree. That's where race comes in.  
soledadobrien	709387605952110592	2016-03-14T14:35:59	Hi Michael. How are you?  
soledadobrien	709387444068749312	2016-03-14T14:35:21	Nope--you're totally in error on this.  
soledadobrien	709387310744412160	2016-03-14T14:34:49	Right. That to me explains a lot of the anger we are seeing (among all races).  
soledadobrien	709387086697205760	2016-03-14T14:33:55	No boo, look at PBS reporting on transition from indentured servitude to slavery in the original colonies.That's it 
soledadobrien	709386483455664128	2016-03-14T14:31:32	If jobs are negotiated away (i.e. the many biz who head overseas for cheap labor) leaving under educ pop jobless? 
soledadobrien	709385993565179904	2016-03-14T14:29:35	Right. So if you're a parent trying to get your kid a good educ and your kids' school sucks--isn't that blame worthy 
soledadobrien	709385326721175552	2016-03-14T14:26:56	Thanks! Here's an interesting story on a Trump voter.  
soledadobrien	709385059405578240	2016-03-14T14:25:52	Are there are some issues that deserve blaming--poor schools? Job opportunities negotiated away? Regardless of race 
soledadobrien	709384508588613632	2016-03-14T14:23:41	Did you read the washingtonpost story I tweeted earlier? Thoughts?  
soledadobrien	709383981494575105	2016-03-14T14:21:35	I feel I'm losing control of this interview! Lol. Anyway--so Q at end of article. What if trump loses. What happens? 
soledadobrien	709383605894705153	2016-03-14T14:20:06	Said with love, but you have no clue what you're talking about. You've jumped into the middle of my conversation. Xo 
soledadobrien	709381957226987520	2016-03-14T14:13:32	Oh THIS guy. Just block him. Not worthy of your time.  
soledadobrien	709381549775519744	2016-03-14T14:11:55	I asked him a question. We are discussing the Trump voter and an excellent article in the washingtonpost 
soledadobrien	709381243184553984	2016-03-14T14:10:42	We've already established that.  
soledadobrien	709380873410453504	2016-03-14T14:09:14	Oh crap--I muted you and here you are again. Go away. I'm having an interesting conversation.  
soledadobrien	709380572834111488	2016-03-14T14:08:02	You're agreeing with each other.  
soledadobrien	709380415493169152	2016-03-14T14:07:25	Yes. That's been a national narrative for a while. (Your first sentence).  
soledadobrien	709380088719081472	2016-03-14T14:06:07	Yes. My experiences reporting on these voters and frankly over the past 15 years or so would have me agree.  
soledadobrien	709379769977212928	2016-03-14T14:04:51	I hear ya--but literally--that wasn't the conversation we were having. We were discussing economic privilege.  
soledadobrien	709379365046456320	2016-03-14T14:03:14	And how does that intersect with racial (sometimes racist) and other vile discourse? 
soledadobrien	709378954277330945	2016-03-14T14:01:36	People: we are literally discussing economic privilege  at this moment-- and comparing two white men.  
soledadobrien	709378506103398400	2016-03-14T13:59:50	Here's my question: folks you grew up with, who didn't leave home, college, etc. What are their political views?  
soledadobrien	709378113453617152	2016-03-14T13:58:16	Hmmm--then every American has the privilege to spew hatred, correct? So--circular logic. Moving on.. 
soledadobrien	709377652302462977	2016-03-14T13:56:26	Lord, never. I'm appreciating this conversation. The 140 characters is killing me.  
soledadobrien	709377341747638272	2016-03-14T13:55:12	Since he's discussing the comments of another white man, I think you may be losing some context here. But--Twitter.  
soledadobrien	709376669988085760	2016-03-14T13:52:32	Ah got it. I think where race intersects class is also driving this issue. Changing racial dynamic is scaring some.  
soledadobrien	709376121146621952	2016-03-14T13:50:21	I'm sorry--you lost me. What are you disagreeing with?  
soledadobrien	709375824839966720	2016-03-14T13:49:10	I think that's definitely part of it.  
soledadobrien	709375038777069568	2016-03-14T13:46:03	ewdrew1977 soledadobrien rebeccarnelson I grew up black mid class and still realized world  changing around me.

soledadobrien	709372727463952385	2016-03-14T13:36:52	I think this is also about America's class divide. The struggle to not fall out of America's middle class.  
soledadobrien	709368313068048385	2016-03-14T13:19:19	This is a really great article:  
soledadobrien	709366945552965633	2016-03-14T13:13:53	I knew it! Lol 
soledadobrien	709352157452115968	2016-03-14T12:15:08	From my trump-supporter intvs: 1. we need someone who fights for us.  2. Changing demographics of US are upsetting.

soledadobrien	709148456305172480	2016-03-13T22:45:41	This is quite true.

soledadobrien	709147833492967426	2016-03-13T22:43:13	Yes--maybe worse. To just be ignored.  
soledadobrien	709147530379005952	2016-03-13T22:42:01	Doesn't make it 'reverse' anything.  
soledadobrien	709147352171462656	2016-03-13T22:41:18	I would imagine that Disabled Anerican Veterans are routinely discriminated against--white, black, and all.  
soledadobrien	709145444203536384	2016-03-13T22:33:43	There literally is no such thing as 'reverse discrimination'. Discrimination is discrimination.  
soledadobrien	709113583154679808	2016-03-13T20:27:07	You should. Winter here is really miserable.

soledadobrien	708840566176542721	2016-03-13T02:22:15	That said--a calm, experienced horse won't mind and will take good care of a nervous rider.

soledadobrien	708800729851371520	2016-03-12T23:43:57	Correct--what's the 'conventional wisdom' around the number of Latino voters a GOP candidate needs to win general? 
soledadobrien	708797360244011010	2016-03-12T23:30:34	Yup. Horses can definitely sense anger or anxiety. I think she recognizes me--though she's sweet to everybody!

soledadobrien	691659922451275777	2016-01-25T16:32:30	@IamDonCheadle your stories don't matter. You're not part of the national narrative.People making decisions don't want to really 'normalize'
soledadobrien	691659350230724608	2016-01-25T16:30:14	Basically it's (historic and current) white supremacy at work at every level in a specific industry.  
soledadobrien	691658401789546497	2016-01-25T16:26:28	@IamDonCheadle to be honest. You need pre-teens if you want to know all the shorthand babe. Lol

soledadobrien	688925042546241536	2016-01-18T03:25:04	Sanders can just barely keep his head above water on foreign policy questions. Denounces Iraq war instead of analyzing Iran cogently.

soledadobrien	688916755603976192	2016-01-18T02:52:08	Yes. But one has to examine the national picture.  
soledadobrien	688916548979916800	2016-01-18T02:51:19	It's literally not about class. One reason Heroin getting so much attn is it's hitting middle class whites.
