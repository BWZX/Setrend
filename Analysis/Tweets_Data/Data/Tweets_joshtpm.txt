joshtpm	725138290832199680	2016-04-27T01:43:35	3/ a decade later they were still trying to get word back to friendly settlers in Massachusetts for help getting back. They were still ...
joshtpm	725137862539235328	2016-04-27T01:41:53	2/ but for various reasons the ship couldn't find anywhere to sell them. So they ended up being dumped in Tangier, in other words in Morroco
