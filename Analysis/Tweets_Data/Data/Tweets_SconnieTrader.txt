SconnieTrader	691654762773757952	2016-01-25T16:12:00	Just to be clear, the CEO of JCI who will be leading the combined company was apparently almost fired for his dealings w/ a Ponzi scheme.

SconnieTrader	691402379212775425	2016-01-24T23:29:07	VincePagano it was at that value and price! Haha. But I think shareholders would pass.

SconnieTrader	691397499102314500	2016-01-24T23:09:43	tangentstyle IPO was 2013 and there has been triple digit rev growth. Don't think the IPO price matters.
SconnieTrader	691397087477526528	2016-01-24T23:08:05	tangentstyle I disagree. Everyone is already so negative on it. I bought this week at 16.
SconnieTrader	691395861260193792	2016-01-24T23:03:13	tangentstyle it's down from over 70 to 18 with the 70 pct revenue growth.

SconnieTrader	691304380289683460	2016-01-24T16:59:42	LongVollllll they expecting 10 pct EPS growth for next few heads and returning a lot of money to shareholders.
SconnieTrader	691303552124375041	2016-01-24T16:56:25	LongVollllll it's impressive. Was a bit early in the name but it was SO undervalued and trading for yrs as if it wouldn't ever grow again.
SconnieTrader	691302923737894912	2016-01-24T16:53:55	BrattleStCap agreed. It already does trade WAY above its (depressed)  5 year avg multiple.
SconnieTrader	691302427312652288	2016-01-24T16:51:57	LongVollllll has to be higher margins and buyback because they aren't getting double digit rev growth.
SconnieTrader	691302126211956737	2016-01-24T16:50:45	LongVollllll not nearly enough to justify that. Cloud business will grow by leaps and bounds but it's from a low base.
SconnieTrader	691300862111715329	2016-01-24T16:45:43	BrattleStCap so hard to say. I mean with AMZN AWS wasn't worth but now it's all the upside/ worth 1/3rd the stock price?
SconnieTrader	691299904157847552	2016-01-24T16:41:55	LongVollllll it is odd/interesting that they think it'll trade at a premium multiple.
SconnieTrader	691299172264349696	2016-01-24T16:39:01	I'm sure we'll hear a lot about strong dollar from consum staples. Tech companies hopefully gonna show us they still have growth. Earnings

SconnieTrader	691296528586137600	2016-01-24T16:28:30	SconnieTrader MS doesn't seem as concerned about the MSFT multiple as I am. 
SconnieTrader	691295877214924800	2016-01-24T16:25:55	SconnieTrader would need incredible cloud growth for it to trade at that multiple.
SconnieTrader	691295711577706496	2016-01-24T16:25:15	SconnieTrader MSFT has done a very good job and we've been happy with it but 20x is overly ambitious and well above its 5 yr multiple.
SconnieTrader	691295173230333952	2016-01-24T16:23:07	MS targets on MSFT ahead of earnings. Think that the $60 area means time to get out. 20x seems overly generous. 
SconnieTrader	691270112104570880	2016-01-24T14:43:32	34bps so stupid. Until very recently companies this big just laughed at activists anyway. This going after mega caps is a new thing.
