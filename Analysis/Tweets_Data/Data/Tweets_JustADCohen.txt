JustADCohen	698649536441352192	2016-02-13T23:26:44	By my count, 18 Supreme Court Justices have been confirmed by the Senate during presidential election years 
JustADCohen	698652843927040001	2016-02-13T23:39:52	Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia talks about his life and career in this revealing 2008 60Minutes interview: 
JustADCohen	698652093830209537	2016-02-13T23:36:54	Toobin says Scalia's greatest failure was his failure to convince the Court to overturn Roe v. Wade.
JustADCohen	698651984446894080	2016-02-13T23:36:28	Toobin says Heller ruling in 2008 on Second Amendment was Justice Scalia's most significant majority opinion.

JustADCohen	698646507268902912	2016-02-13T23:14:42	Tom Goldstein says it's not realistic to think Senate would confirm even a consensus Scotus pick given atmosphere: 
JustADCohen	698646158202138624	2016-02-13T23:13:18	So many questions going forward: What does Scalia's death mean for the climate change case the Court just interceded in last week?
JustADCohen	698645459246538752	2016-02-13T23:10:32	But an Obama appointee surely would be less conservative than Scalia so post-confirmation things might be different. 
JustADCohen	698645149451071488	2016-02-13T23:09:18	I wonder what went through Edie Windsor's mind when she learned of the death of Justice Scalia....
JustADCohen	698644727873216512	2016-02-13T23:07:37	It took the death of this justice, altering the balance on this Court, to finally make SCOTUS a prime point of a presidential campaign.
JustADCohen	698644326960631808	2016-02-13T23:06:02	No because 4-4 split would just leave lower rulings in place-- and lower rulings usually equal execution.

JustADCohen	698643131512664066	2016-02-13T23:01:17	I wonder how Justice Scalia's great friend, Justice Ginsburg, heard the news; looking forward to her public comment.
JustADCohen	698641724516618240	2016-02-13T22:55:41	Don't forget that Justice Scalia, at 79, was not the oldest on Court. Justice Ginsburg is older. Justice Kennedy just four months younger.

JustADCohen	698641107484184576	2016-02-13T22:53:14	Until the day he died, perhaps, Justice Scalia evidently believed America had never executed an innocent man:

JustADCohen	698639836870111232	2016-02-13T22:48:11	A 4-4 split on the Court means lower court rulings stay in place so this ensures a little more status quo this term than predicted.

JustADCohen	698638658040156161	2016-02-13T22:43:30	Now in the middle of an angry primary season begins the debate over how quickly a president can/should fill a vacant Scotus seat.
JustADCohen	698638072452247552	2016-02-13T22:41:11	It would be interesting to know how many Supreme Court justices have been nominated/confirmed in a president's last  year in office.
JustADCohen	698637638232702976	2016-02-13T22:39:27	Now longest serving justice is Anthony Kennedy, also nominated by Reagan, who for now loses his spot as the Court's swing justice.
JustADCohen	698637432695058432	2016-02-13T22:38:38	He was the oldest serving justice, made it nearly 30 years, enhanced the conservative revolution that Rehnquist had continued from Berger.
JustADCohen	698637129056792576	2016-02-13T22:37:26	Everything can change in a moment. The Court's slim conservative majority is no more. And the 4-4 split upsets all predictions this Term.
