SopanDeb	721809557303873538	2016-04-17T21:16:23	In Poughkeepsie, Trump said if he wanted to, he could make the WY state chairman his best friend within 10 minutes: 
SopanDeb	721808497051099136	2016-04-17T21:12:10	I have never seen this car in my life. 
SopanDeb	721806572679270400	2016-04-17T21:04:32	Trump did a little shimmy walking onto an ice rink to address an overflow crowd in Poughkeepsie:

SopanDeb	721793515412406272	2016-04-17T20:12:39	This was hilarious in Poughkeepsie. Here's Trump when a local sheriff walked on stage uninvited: 
SopanDeb	721781703174266880	2016-04-17T19:25:42	Trump calls super PACs "disgrace to democracy." Leaves out there is one that is aligned with him that has spent at least $1 mill on him.

SopanDeb	721779051384463361	2016-04-17T19:15:10	Guy in a Trump mask trying to get Trump's attention during the speech: 
SopanDeb	721777145874378752	2016-04-17T19:07:36	Trump has said "Crooked Hillary" about four or five times in this speech. He seems to like this nickname.
SopanDeb	721776955457159169	2016-04-17T19:06:50	Trump: "If Kasich would get a little dose of some ads, he would sink like a rock."
SopanDeb	721776271559155712	2016-04-17T19:04:07	It's amazing. Trump really has the mic skills of Steve Austin/The Rock in their primes. Similar pops. Similar crowd reaction, chanting.
SopanDeb	721776009486471169	2016-04-17T19:03:05	Trump is priming the crowd. "Are you ready?" As he gets ready to ask the question..."Who is gonna pay for the wall?!" "Mexico!"
SopanDeb	721775424473284608	2016-04-17T19:00:45	Some people in the audience are mimicking Trump's hand motions as he does his Cruz comes in "holding the Bible high" bit.

SopanDeb	721727484157235200	2016-04-17T15:50:15	In Pennsylvania, Trump is at 46%, in a state where most delegates are unbound.

SopanDeb	721712676989243392	2016-04-17T14:51:25	On Fox, this answer from Lewandowski strikes me as him defending own job performance as much as it's selling Trump:

SopanDeb	721469490031116288	2016-04-16T22:45:05	icowrich But when you do run for delegate, you can run "undeclared" rather than for a candidate.
SopanDeb	721469359823134720	2016-04-16T22:44:34	icowrich functionally the same thing. What I meant in initial tweet: WY gets 3 unpledged delegates regardless, if that makes sense.

SopanDeb	701227524035108864	2016-02-21T02:10:44	PeterKingCBS I'd be shocked if he didn't know. Timed speech to come after Bush's.

SopanDeb	701216062390407168	2016-02-21T01:25:11	Should be noted that Club For Growth, Our Principles, Right To Rise all ran negative ads against Trump in SC this week. Didn't stick.
SopanDeb	701215592238297088	2016-02-21T01:23:19	DavidMDrucker Club For Growth, Our Principles Pac, Right To Rise - all ran ads in South Carolina. It didn't do much, if any damage.
SopanDeb	701215365422936064	2016-02-21T01:22:25	On the notion that the GOP hasn't targeted Trump enough, multiple huge ad campaigns in SC were put up. Didn't do much/if any damage.
SopanDeb	701215239589638145	2016-02-21T01:21:55	DavidMDrucker Every candidate has gone after him. Rand Paul. Cruz has held entire pressers targeting him. Just hasn't stuck.
SopanDeb	701215149693075456	2016-02-21T01:21:34	DavidMDrucker I keep seeing this, and I don't think it's true. Jindal, Perry gave speeches targeting Trump. Graham called him an idiot.

SopanDeb	701214293648216064	2016-02-21T01:18:10	alexburnsNYT For how much longer? At some point, perception matters little. Feels like we've reached that point.

SopanDeb	701209448358936576	2016-02-21T00:58:54	For the anti-Trump folks that follow me - indulge me and finish this sentence. "Donald Trump won't win the GOP nomination because..."
SopanDeb	701208375246372866	2016-02-21T00:54:39	There is still the possibility that a strong alt could consolidate anti-trump vote — but would have to capture rivals' votes by March 15 3/3
