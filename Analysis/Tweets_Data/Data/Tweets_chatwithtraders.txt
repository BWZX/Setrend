chatwithtraders	715004596725399552	2016-03-30T02:35:54	MaxeyAdam1 this is why it doesn't make sense. How can you apply a &lt;7% limit across all stocks... Volatility is different for each stock!
chatwithtraders	715002894798426113	2016-03-30T02:29:08	CrumbCaptial okay... might have to get back on the phone, see if I can get this sorted out.

chatwithtraders	715002028146237440	2016-03-30T02:25:42	CrumbCaptial yeah I recently jumped ship from Saxo, cause commissions were too high.
chatwithtraders	715001815348166657	2016-03-30T02:24:51	CrumbCaptial okay, I'm following. That's why it seems strange, cause I'm not with a big bank broker...

chatwithtraders	714999827684319233	2016-03-30T02:16:57	CrumbCaptial are you saying "server expense" is generally the reason they don't allow this?
chatwithtraders	714999610293501952	2016-03-30T02:16:05	hillmf SPEEROTHEKID Right, okay. I've never touched OTC's, this was with an ASX listed company.

chatwithtraders	714998964253286401	2016-03-30T02:13:31	falafeldiaper1 I don't think it's across the board, likely broker specific.
chatwithtraders	714998802298630147	2016-03-30T02:12:53	scor_zone I know right. Broker specific limitation seems to be the general consensus.
