deray	725643099519635456	2016-04-28T11:09:31	No organization led the unrest here. Young people led the unrest last April. I was there as it unfolded in real time. Young people led.
deray	725642826919206912	2016-04-28T11:08:26	I'd never been shot at with pepper balls until the BaltimoreUprising. And I'd never seen green smoke as a police weapon until then either.

deray	725641984975593472	2016-04-28T11:05:05	It's such an odd experience to see pictures of people speaking authoritatively about the unrest who weren't actually there during it.
