PipCzar	707977869172064258	2016-03-10T17:14:12	PipCzar What about the "forward guidance" element of communication from CBs, allows markets to build expectations,which fail to materialise

PipCzar	707977330090582016	2016-03-10T17:12:03	I agree. Fiscal policies are probably next to change in a big way 
PipCzar	707977136317935619	2016-03-10T17:11:17	Ch2Christo This is the most bearish price action I have seen in a long ass time

PipCzar	695250511423893504	2016-02-04T14:20:13	8XD23 yes, the irrelevance of the BOJ is stunning the FX market
PipCzar	695250281106255872	2016-02-04T14:19:18	NCheron_CMC maybe a bit of a stretch ;^)
PipCzar	695249234350608385	2016-02-04T14:15:09	However, long EUR/GBP is in my wheelhouse of "no USD positions ahead of NFP" ;^)
PipCzar	695249032713605120	2016-02-04T14:14:21	This is exactly how I see the DXY. It's in a wedge, and we are at the lower end of it now. So careful bulls/bears. 
PipCzar	695248641519255552	2016-02-04T14:12:47	I will not have any USD positions into tomorrow's NFP. In my opinion, tomorrow's number is a do or die for the DXY for next 1-2 months
PipCzar	695248420085198848	2016-02-04T14:11:55	TsaniasFX Yes, for now. A lot depends on tomorrow's NFP. Make or break it!

PipCzar	687631240602632192	2016-01-14T13:43:57	EUR/CAD tweezer top 4 hour chart. These candlestick patterns are hard to come by. If you think Crude is bouncing... 
PipCzar	687628900571074560	2016-01-14T13:34:40	Crude oil, if it is going to squeeze, this is the level it needs to break higher today (right here) -----&gt;

PipCzar	687610058046181376	2016-01-14T12:19:47	Another divergence is the USD/JPY and the SPX futures as well. USD/JPY did NOT hit a new trend low 
PipCzar	687609236461719552	2016-01-14T12:16:31	Notice the divergence between the USD/MXN and SPX futures. USD/MXN suggests that the SPX may be due for a bounce
