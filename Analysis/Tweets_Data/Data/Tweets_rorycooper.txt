rorycooper	714835839692484608	2016-03-29T15:25:19	Team Trump's handling of the Fields incident is basically a blueprint for turning a minor airspace issue w/China into thermonuclear war.
rorycooper	714823625023561728	2016-03-29T14:36:47	Yes, more interaction with his erratic, dishonest and violent staff will do the trick.

rorycooper	714457410505728001	2016-03-28T14:21:35	Like Louisiana, the GOP convention will be rules driven and represent a party. And if Trump can't accept that, he should leave now. 9/9
rorycooper	714456851123933185	2016-03-28T14:19:21	Trumps's supporters deserve a voice. But so do the more than half of Republicans who will never support him. 8/
rorycooper	714456579744120834	2016-03-28T14:18:17	Running as an independent is even harder, which is why Trump's threats were always baseless. His whole life has been easy. He needs easy. 7/
rorycooper	714456177397133312	2016-03-28T14:16:41	More than half of Republicans continue to vote against Trump. And if he loses at the convention, his petulant response won't change that. 6/
rorycooper	714455605851856897	2016-03-28T14:14:25	Trump claims to be a savvy businessman and negotiator, but he and his advisers can't figure out a really simple process. That's on them. 5/
rorycooper	714455225667596288	2016-03-28T14:12:54	Nothing un-democratic about a candidate who falls short of delegate majority losing nomination, or losing delegate selection process. 4/
rorycooper	714454824184578051	2016-03-28T14:11:18	He's running for a party's nomination. Could've run as an independent, but he wants party infrastructure. Playing by rules is tradeoff. 3/
rorycooper	714454416972193800	2016-03-28T14:09:41	Trump's tweet suggests he 1) has no idea how the nomination process works 2) will use lies and threats to challenge legitimate process.

rorycooper	713420705052893184	2016-03-25T17:42:05	Trump attacks are always more about him than his opponent. Low energy, lying, repetitious, incompetent, cheater...he's describing himself.

rorycooper	703064752990216192	2016-02-26T03:51:14	This was by far the most important debate of the cycle. And Rubio nailed it. Had Trump on the ropes the entire time and he never let up.
rorycooper	703063662685065216	2016-02-26T03:46:54	People taking pictures with Cruz in the break and his girls are making faces and bunny ears behind them and it's really cute.
rorycooper	703061170903605248	2016-02-26T03:37:00	On every issue, Rubio knows 10x as much as the person asking the question.

rorycooper	703056291770404864	2016-02-26T03:17:36	Trump looks tired. Low energy. Sad!
rorycooper	703055831869227008	2016-02-26T03:15:47	No legit reason realDonaldTrump can't release returns while being audited, but if scared, release earlier returns no longer under audit.

rorycooper	703051755114754048	2016-02-26T02:59:35	Finally someone is demanding a plan on the national debt. Rubio exactly right. Huge problem next President will have to tackle.
rorycooper	703051029672173568	2016-02-26T02:56:42	Trump doesn't want any more questions. Waving the towel.

rorycooper	703046817022259200	2016-02-26T02:39:57	Rubio has Trump on the ropes and owns the crowd right now. It's incredible.
rorycooper	703044918051115008	2016-02-26T02:32:25	You could hear audible gasps in the room, from his supporters, when Trump started defending Planned Parenthood.
rorycooper	703044418442436609	2016-02-26T02:30:25	Rubio says you can't trust Trump to appoint conservative justices. Trump responds by defending Planned Parenthood. Wow.
rorycooper	703043191285555200	2016-02-26T02:25:33	Cruz should be crushing the Supreme Court exchange...and he's just not.
rorycooper	703042255498575872	2016-02-26T02:21:50	Trump says he'll bring back jobs from China, except the ones that make his ugly ties.
rorycooper	703039406194741250	2016-02-26T02:10:30	I have been very tough on Rubio on immigration in the past. But he nailed the facts on that DACA answer.
rorycooper	703038299435311104	2016-02-26T02:06:07	Wow, Rubio’s really bringing it to Trump. He came prepared, like an oppo bazooka.
rorycooper	703038324466778112	2016-02-26T02:06:13	Rubio has Trump on tilt.
rorycooper	703037128054169600	2016-02-26T02:01:27	It's like we're taking a break to take a look in on the undercard debate.
rorycooper	703034623203278848	2016-02-26T01:51:30	That's the best answer on immigration Rubio has given in any debate and he took it to Trump at the same time.

rorycooper	702873890263945217	2016-02-25T15:12:48	Pretty simple, if you want to be in a two-person race against Trump, you have to show what that will look like tonight.
