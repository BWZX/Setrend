thomaswright08	716036059755360256	2016-04-01T22:54:34	jonfavs AriMelber  implication of that frame is he can learn on the job. Alt frame: he is driven by a dangerous ideology
thomaswright08	716035297805516801	2016-04-01T22:51:32	This is correct. Current US doctrine reserves the right to use nukes to defend NATO allies, including first use.

thomaswright08	715599799995789315	2016-03-31T18:01:02	And having a majority of voters means he gets to redefine terrorism as a club against his critics?! Turkey2023

thomaswright08	687369469354717184	2016-01-13T20:23:46	lldzne  interesting, thank you. As I mentioned in an earlier response, I have a different view 
thomaswright08	687368707794927617	2016-01-13T20:20:45	GerardAraud KoriSchake Agreed. I was trying to argue exactly that-- it is needed but the work of academic realists has hurt, not helped

thomaswright08	687366559216566272	2016-01-13T20:12:13	GerardAraud KoriSchake Yes but the whole point of the article is that US academic realism has departed from that mainstream

thomaswright08	687113071135997953	2016-01-13T03:24:56	Seems like a good time to tweet my July 2014 essay in TheAtlantic on why the "ancient hatreds" thesis is dangerous: 
thomaswright08	687111455901138948	2016-01-13T03:18:31	End of the speech was strong. Lots of good parts but the foreign policy section fell short. SOTU
thomaswright08	687107026074382341	2016-01-13T03:00:55	alexwardb premise is deeply flawed imo. About interests and the U.S. led liberal order, not just direct threats to homeland or even allies
thomaswright08	687106027662262272	2016-01-13T02:56:57	The big foreign policy story missing in tonight's speech is the intensification of geopolitical rivalry in the M East, Europe, &amp; E Asia.
thomaswright08	687103515584540672	2016-01-13T02:46:58	Exactly. And these are not failed states 
thomaswright08	687102969943306240	2016-01-13T02:44:48	It's conventional wisdom to say failed states are more of a threat/ challenge than strong states but it is not true 1/2
thomaswright08	687094960093577217	2016-01-13T02:12:58	Exactly. People said the same about the Balkans. All wars have history but they are made &amp; unmade by people. 
thomaswright08	687094321322024960	2016-01-13T02:10:26	First half: true. Second half: cynical, self serving and wrong. US should not echo such essentialist errors.

thomaswright08	687092981116067840	2016-01-13T02:05:06	Bad line. "Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia"
thomaswright08	686970750830534657	2016-01-12T17:59:24	keohanedan nueni pretty sure the Swiss and Germans don't consider what the Irish (or British) eat is actually chocolate
thomaswright08	686747908662767616	2016-01-12T03:13:55	speechboy71 yes. And his 1989 interview I tweeted about earlier is truly extraordinary in that regard.
thomaswright08	686747232222220288	2016-01-12T03:11:13	speechboy71 fair point. Wld note the definitive long-form piece on his political evolution or lack thereof has yet to be written.
thomaswright08	686746100506693632	2016-01-12T03:06:44	Politically, Trump has always been a protectionist, nationalist, pro-authoritarian, self styled tough guy. He hasn't really changed.  2/2
thomaswright08	686745207371644928	2016-01-12T03:03:11	Good line but reading Trump's old interviews, I'm struck at how little he has changed his views over 30 years 1/2 
thomaswright08	686729267913293824	2016-01-12T01:59:50	Very surprised to learn David Bowie was responsible for bringing down the Berlin Wall. I had understood it was David Hasselhoff.

thomaswright08	686670520050446336	2016-01-11T22:06:24	Also from that Trump interview 
thomaswright08	686669077750910976	2016-01-11T22:00:40	One of the amazing things about this interview w/ Trump from 1989 is how consistent his views are. 
thomaswright08	686653006738288640	2016-01-11T20:56:48	Those surprised Chris Hughes announced TNR sale on Medium forget he published his response to the mass resignations in the washingtonpost
