Emergingtrends	722445470577111040	2016-04-19T15:23:17	mcar20156 well.. The magnitude of inflows isnt that spectacular - mostly etfs... True cause is lack of mkt liquidity imo
Emergingtrends	722396077094211589	2016-04-19T12:07:00	stojeipatrze perhaps but think its also 1) momentum and 2) complete lack of liquidity 3) low willingness to fade given poor q1 perf by hf's

Emergingtrends	714923198635196418	2016-03-29T21:12:27	boes_ yes on the latter but not the former? And i cant see how she should be happy with mkt pricing in just one hike over 12m when that is
Emergingtrends	714920264216260610	2016-03-29T21:00:48	Emergingtrends Yellen was dovish, but was she as dovish as the Bberg headline emphasis?!

Emergingtrends	714893810162135040	2016-03-29T19:15:41	Quite bizarre that Yellen feels the need to send mkts into a frenzy that's resulting in curve pricing considerably less than the Dots median

Emergingtrends	710909554532421632	2016-03-18T19:23:40	GMacTrading haha classic
Emergingtrends	710900712989978624	2016-03-18T18:48:32	Emergingtrends the chart is contribution to mom core in bps
Emergingtrends	710900546014736385	2016-03-18T18:47:52	Emergingtrends the significance of this is that the two that have trended higher are more likely to stay high
Emergingtrends	710900276098682880	2016-03-18T18:46:48	Emergingtrends only apparel looks like a random spike up to me.. Whereas the two others that have picked up have trended up
Emergingtrends	710899997143863297	2016-03-18T18:45:41	Yellen wrong 2 be relaxed abt core CPI? Chart shows contrib to mom core of 3 now-higher contrib'ing infl categories 
Emergingtrends	710898716643819520	2016-03-18T18:40:36	econhedge apart from apparel
Emergingtrends	710898671970328577	2016-03-18T18:40:25	econhedge youre not wrong about false dawns - what strikes me this time is the categories that have moved up have trended not spiked up
Emergingtrends	710882198375833600	2016-03-18T17:34:58	econhedge her arguments on core cpi are rather weak too - only the apparel category looks like a random spike recently

Emergingtrends	710197767617056768	2016-03-16T20:15:17	One thing that is fairly clear is that EURUSD is going to 1.15 and beyond...
Emergingtrends	710197654622478336	2016-03-16T20:14:50	Emergingtrends interpreted very hawkishly. And now the mkt pricing leas than one hike this year - clever!
Emergingtrends	710197437554663425	2016-03-16T20:13:58	Emergingtrends so a switch of two fomc members to 3 hikes would lead to a median of 3 hikes, which of course the mkt would have
Emergingtrends	710197272689115136	2016-03-16T20:13:19	Interesting that the median dot was not far at all from being a 3 hikes this year... 7 expect more than 2, 9 are at 2 hikes, 1 at 1 hike

Emergingtrends	697018259825172480	2016-02-09T11:24:37	@KeshikCapital exactly
Emergingtrends	697018210210738176	2016-02-09T11:24:25	Emergingtrends lot of trying to fit a story to the moves (Coco bonds, obscure Portuguese bank credit event)... These merely a trigger
Emergingtrends	697018024214339584	2016-02-09T11:23:41	The moves in EZ banks in my view looks to be down to position unwinding - investors were heavily long EZ banks going into this.
Emergingtrends	697017743653105664	2016-02-09T11:22:34	BisphamGreen joshuademasi stay out of both

Emergingtrends	696760550127235072	2016-02-08T18:20:34	BisphamGreen joshuademasi no i dont... But implicitly if you r going to go long em outright you have to be confident that DM will be ok
Emergingtrends	696758409585098752	2016-02-08T18:12:04	BisphamGreen joshuademasi sorry but outright long (ie not rv) is crazy if developed mkts/econs trip up
Emergingtrends	696757134843887617	2016-02-08T18:07:00	joshuademasi BisphamGreen yes cos EM isnt dependent on the ROW is it?! I hope you are not outright long

Emergingtrends	696267847635435520	2016-02-07T09:42:45	georgemagnus1 George how do you think the source of outflow has chgd? At the start it was corps paying off debt.. Now mainly individuals?

Emergingtrends	694603692075540480	2016-02-02T19:29:59	BisphamGreen exactly - completely agree... And yet some say the banxico is the highest quality em cb
Emergingtrends	694600491653808128	2016-02-02T19:17:16	BisphamGreen an implied yield differential of 3% frankly is a joke for a currency this volatile
Emergingtrends	694586249269616640	2016-02-02T18:20:41	astonjonathanp yeah diff to tell in which they r larger though - would think equity futures as greater liquidity there
Emergingtrends	694582071050817537	2016-02-02T18:04:05	astonjonathanp sure oil cud be in there so their actual eq positions may be smaller than indicated here. Still, id guess theyre still big

Emergingtrends	694579737772032001	2016-02-02T17:54:48	astonjonathanp hmm not sure high yield would be a main position - too illiquid. Oil perhaps one of them. But hard to disentangle given high
Emergingtrends	694466550275969028	2016-02-02T10:25:02	Emergingtrends it is extremely worrying if computers could be behind a move that might tip global economic sentiment over the edge

Emergingtrends	693157203453308929	2016-01-29T19:42:10	Interesting that the US front end is still at the lows (in rates) given two of the concerns for the Fed are alleviating: oil and markets

Emergingtrends	692327883042373633	2016-01-27T12:46:44	Interesting that despite all the focus on oil, its only down 5 USD since the last Fed meeting. Plus data hasnt been universally weak at all
