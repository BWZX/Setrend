piersmorgan	715535053758074880	2016-03-31T13:43:45	Can't bear Piers Morgan. He's an arsehole- but he is also right; standing topless flicking your middle finger doesn't promote feminism.
piersmorgan	715534544045092864	2016-03-31T13:41:43	I love women &amp; 100% support gender equality. But pretending that topless bird-flicking selfies promote feminism is ridiculous.
piersmorgan	715533754442211328	2016-03-31T13:38:35	Kim/Emily aren't posting these photos to 'empower' women in the cause of feminism. They're doing it to make money. 
piersmorgan	715533075543797760	2016-03-31T13:35:53	Well, if Tom Hiddleston began tweeting endless photos of himself topless &amp; flicking the bird, would everyone find it 'empowering' or tragic?
piersmorgan	715532918492241920	2016-03-31T13:35:16	I see my 'RIP feminism' tweet is garnering a lot of attention.  Many women asking what I'd feel if a man did this: 
piersmorgan	715531135816601601	2016-03-31T13:28:11	EmilyJaneBond82 C_C_Gill would women still love him if he started posting endless photos of himself topless &amp; flicking the bird?
piersmorgan	715530610165436416	2016-03-31T13:26:06	Never seen anyone make people instinctively smile on sight quite like Ronnie Corbett.  A universally popular &amp; beloved man.  Very sad day.
piersmorgan	715529025200893956	2016-03-31T13:19:48	Ronnie Corbett - an impeccably mannered gentleman and a rascally spirit.

piersmorgan	715354928307240960	2016-03-31T01:48:00	Correct.  
piersmorgan	715354111953080320	2016-03-31T01:44:45	If women genuinely think this photo advocates women's rights &amp; equality, then feminism as it was intended is dead. 
piersmorgan	715353483939942401	2016-03-31T01:42:15	It's supposed to be the advocacy of women's rights &amp; equality with men.  Not, I dare to suggest, topless selfies.

piersmorgan	715283473632591873	2016-03-30T21:04:04	Oh Emily, enough of this nonsensical pseudo-feminist gibberish. If not for me, then for Emmeline.  
piersmorgan	715280789517107201	2016-03-30T20:53:24	Why should all choices be respected?  If I make a bad choice, I get rightly disrespected.  
piersmorgan	715280534377631744	2016-03-30T20:52:23	Thanks Ms Tobin. It's sunny in Beverly Hills with a dash of nimbus.  
piersmorgan	715280392308137985	2016-03-30T20:51:49	I don't dispute their right to get their kit off &amp; flick the bird to millions of strangers.  It's just tacky.  
piersmorgan	715279543951429633	2016-03-30T20:48:27	I said I totally disagree with him about abortion. As I do on a number of other issues.  
piersmorgan	715273086132555776	2016-03-30T20:22:47	Well I'd never make abortion illegal to start with.  But if you break a law, you are normally punished in some way.  
piersmorgan	715266048853848064	2016-03-30T19:54:49	Thanks mate. If Wenger stays on then I doubt it.  
piersmorgan	715265584359821312	2016-03-30T19:52:58	Most Republicans want abortion banned. I'd be fascinated to hear how they believe such a ban should be enforced without punishment?
piersmorgan	715263250145783808	2016-03-30T19:43:42	If you break the law you get punished. If abortion's made illegal, offenders  must be punished. Which is why it must never be made illegal.
piersmorgan	715261041723068416	2016-03-30T19:34:55	100% disagree with Trump re abortion but if something's made illegal there has to be punishment for doing it or how else do you enforce law?
piersmorgan	715259296544501760	2016-03-30T19:27:59	RIP feminism. 
piersmorgan	715257704231604225	2016-03-30T19:21:40	piersmorgan emrata so they choose to express their freedom topless in a loo! 🙄
piersmorgan	715256357264330752	2016-03-30T19:16:19	Yes, luv. But giving the bird to millions of strangers as you stand topless &amp; gormless probably isn't the best way.  
piersmorgan	715254104549761026	2016-03-30T19:07:21	Just a thought KimKardashian emrata - but you could always try wearing a little dignity?

piersmorgan	714930228422795264	2016-03-29T21:40:23	For some reason Lord_Sugar keeps popping up in my "who to follow" list -- and I blame you, piersmorgan
piersmorgan	714927208905646080	2016-03-29T21:28:23	If this is criminal battery, I'm an Aardvark.  Fields Lewandowski Trump
piersmorgan	714926634827190272	2016-03-29T21:26:07	Piers Morgan and the Trump campaign say Michelle Fields should "toughen up" 
piersmorgan	714921954956849153	2016-03-29T21:07:31	Doesn't make her any less noisy.  
piersmorgan	714921488277643264	2016-03-29T21:05:40	Many things, but this 'scandal' is absurd nonsense.  
piersmorgan	714920867407470592	2016-03-29T21:03:12	Much anticipated piersmorgan interview with realDonaldTrump just started on UTVIreland now. Should be interesting!

piersmorgan	714920877482086401	2016-03-29T21:03:14	I don't support journalist wusses.  
piersmorgan	714920574393257988	2016-03-29T21:02:02	Why Michelle Fields let herself &amp; her profession down over this Trumped-up battery nonsense. My new column: 
piersmorgan	714919156206800898	2016-03-29T20:56:24	Toughen Up, Ms Fields! That  police Trump video makes your 'battery' claim look ridiculous. My new column:  
piersmorgan	714917030269464577	2016-03-29T20:47:57	President Trump will deport Piers Morgan last. 
piersmorgan	714917248222302210	2016-03-29T20:48:49	Trump speaking to reporters aboard plane: I know piersmorgan and many, many people saw that tape and said 'you gotta be kidding.'
piersmorgan	714917010413592577	2016-03-29T20:47:52	Trump just cited piersmorgan's opinion of the video
piersmorgan	714915381522071552	2016-03-29T20:41:24	1 of Trump's main campaign msgs: loyalty to his ppl. That's what he'll say at GOPTownHall, right? He's being loyal  
piersmorgan	714911504730951680	2016-03-29T20:25:59	My new DailyMail column about Michelle Fields &amp; Corey Lewandowski is finished. Posting soon.
piersmorgan	714883275232129025	2016-03-29T18:33:49	This is so absurd, I'm going to have to write a column about it. Lewandowski battery
piersmorgan	714880977558896640	2016-03-29T18:24:41	That's racist.  
piersmorgan	714880651783049216	2016-03-29T18:23:23	Mate, I really wouldn't get into an aesthetic argument with that head.  Now pipe down.  
piersmorgan	714879774410145792	2016-03-29T18:19:54	That's verbal battery.  I'm pressing charges.  
piersmorgan	714879136523689984	2016-03-29T18:17:22	Can you imagine Barbara Walters, Katie Couric or Diane Sawyer claiming 'battery' for this? Just ridiculous.  
piersmorgan	714878665314533376	2016-03-29T18:15:30	Now THAT'S battery.  By a Segway.  
piersmorgan	714877008455421952	2016-03-29T18:08:55	It was 5 ribs, actually.  
piersmorgan	714876492887425024	2016-03-29T18:06:52	That's Piersaphobic.  
piersmorgan	714874988579258368	2016-03-29T18:00:53	If a male reporter tried to claim this was 'battery', he'd be rightly mocked.  Toughen up, MichelleFields.  
piersmorgan	714873407347642368	2016-03-29T17:54:36	That's it? This constitutes a criminal charge of 'battery'? How utterly pathetic.    
piersmorgan	714864925940711424	2016-03-29T17:20:54	Is this in order of importance? 
piersmorgan	714825555271507968	2016-03-29T14:44:27	How many more years of PL &amp; CL failure does Wenger preside over before he has to go? 2, 5, 10, 20... 50 (by then he'd be 116)?   afc
piersmorgan	714823973490429952	2016-03-29T14:38:10	So Wenger insists he's going nowhere. Why is it HIS decision? afc
piersmorgan	714823412506451969	2016-03-29T14:35:56	I know it shouldn't, but this made me laugh. Imagine having the cojones to take a selfie in that situation....

piersmorgan	714639317310660608	2016-03-29T02:24:25	Watching frankrichny on donlemon. Such a smart guy, used to love chewing the political fat with him at CNN.
piersmorgan	714637367278055424	2016-03-29T02:16:40	On another note: there is literally almost no better feeling than cleaning your ears after you get out of the shower 🙃👌🏽
piersmorgan	714636551867670530	2016-03-29T02:13:25	My favourite parody account. Though very hard to work out it's a parody.  
piersmorgan	714632631044874241	2016-03-29T01:57:51	And why an indictment is surely a big possibility? 
piersmorgan	714632030445838337	2016-03-29T01:55:27	I really love watching GeraldoRivera dance. I'm dead serious.

piersmorgan	714610916566769664	2016-03-29T00:31:33	I like him personally &amp; think he's done an OK job. But very weak re issues like gun control &amp; terrorism.  
piersmorgan	714609613576929280	2016-03-29T00:26:23	It is, but not with me. I'm in Beverly Hills where it's only 5.26pm.  
piersmorgan	714609130212696064	2016-03-29T00:24:28	One of them was giving an honest opinion.....I suspect it wasn't POTUS. 
piersmorgan	714602099867258881	2016-03-28T23:56:31	I agree piersmorgan PC culture: an excuse for lazy intellect at best, at worst actually perpetuates 'isms.'

piersmorgan	713471938971045888	2016-03-25T21:05:40	Of course I know this, but there are still many illegal immigrants coming over Mexican border. Just a fact.  
piersmorgan	713471411470241792	2016-03-25T21:03:34	Trump seems to be doing just fine in this race without needing me to enable him.  
piersmorgan	713471195081940992	2016-03-25T21:02:43	Among questions I ask Trump tonight: 1) Do you hate Muslims? 2) How would you reduce gun violence? 3) Why have you never drunk alcohol?
piersmorgan	713470708651679745	2016-03-25T21:00:47	I'm not his spokesman, I'm promoting a major interview I have with him on ITV tonight.

piersmorgan	713464249406742528	2016-03-25T20:35:07	He'd make a deal. Trump's one of the best deal-makers in America.  
piersmorgan	713463241389637636	2016-03-25T20:31:06	That's nonsense. America has around 5 million Muslims who've largely integrated very well.

piersmorgan	713462917992026112	2016-03-25T20:29:49	To stop the flood of illegal immigrants coming in over the border. Most Americans share his concern on that.  
piersmorgan	713462725188259840	2016-03-25T20:29:03	Trump said it after this massacre:  
piersmorgan	713461657343643649	2016-03-25T20:24:49	I believe he was referring to radicalised Islamic extremists murdering people in their communities.

piersmorgan	713354324865261569	2016-03-25T13:18:19	Yes, and will continue to do so if he wins the nomination. Trump's not considered very right wing in the U.S.
