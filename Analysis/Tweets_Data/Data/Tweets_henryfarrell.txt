henryfarrell	695230023549194240	2016-02-04T12:58:49	swarthmoreburke But given how this started and continued, this doesn’t feel like that kind of debate right now, so I’m going to bow out.

henryfarrell	695229680719380480	2016-02-04T12:57:27	swarthmoreburke It’d be nice for starters if you would acknowledge this basic initial error. Then, if you want to go on and write …
henryfarrell	695229488213446656	2016-02-04T12:56:41	swarthmoreburke You claimed that the post said something that it explicitly was not saying. This is now being retweeted because: take sides
henryfarrell	695225703785218049	2016-02-04T12:41:39	swarthmoreburke again we could have that argument - but “Africa had states you fool” weak rejoinder to piece that explicitly said just that
henryfarrell	695224855223001088	2016-02-04T12:38:16	swarthmoreburke but by all means we could have the usual (and sometimes useful) history vs pol sci fight over this.

henryfarrell	695222150408617984	2016-02-04T12:27:31	swarthmoreburke Key issue is whether there was a _state system_ - very different question

henryfarrell	693455399698198528	2016-01-30T15:27:05	5. As henryfarrell notes, Mill's response to famine was "to contemn in the harshest terms efforts to help" people starving to death
henryfarrell	693453453474009088	2016-01-30T15:19:21	4. We can appreciate the exact nature of Mill's "benevolent" imperialism by reading him on the Irish potato famine: 
henryfarrell	693452986215993344	2016-01-30T15:17:30	3. According to Gopnik, Mill was "a servant of British imperialism, but a benevolent kind."
