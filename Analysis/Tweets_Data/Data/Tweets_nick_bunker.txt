nick_bunker	699977183675203588	2016-02-17T15:22:20	DannyVinik I think one of the old CAP proposals was to target half the average. But everyone seems to have shifted to median.
nick_bunker	699976399378128900	2016-02-17T15:19:13	Martin’s right that SWFs could align public and private incentives. Emphasis on the *could*. But that’d require just a touch of socialism.

nick_bunker	695614884189442048	2016-02-05T14:28:06	JHWeissmann man, I really need to actually write this “case for nominal wage growth” post
nick_bunker	695614602021838848	2016-02-05T14:26:59	JHWeissmann because we want to see how much of increasing wage growth is from tightening labor market vs. low inflation
nick_bunker	695613858589835264	2016-02-05T14:24:02	JHWeissmann same. I’d wager inflation would tick up before we get there.
nick_bunker	695613350085001216	2016-02-05T14:22:01	And u6-u3, a decent measure of labor market slack, ticked up. But that’s b/c u3 dropped while u6 is stuck at 9.9%

nick_bunker	695601573985185792	2016-02-05T13:35:13	Here there. Prime-age EPOP jumped up to 77.7% from 77.4%

nick_bunker	694961266444623872	2016-02-03T19:10:52	JoshZumbrun agreed!
nick_bunker	694961099825897474	2016-02-03T19:10:12	JoshZumbrun also I think this would be  more a pro-cyclical phenomenon: it’d give more leverage during the good times.
nick_bunker	694960965545299969	2016-02-03T19:09:40	JoshZumbrun differs from prob of getting job from unemployment for other reasons (2/2)
nick_bunker	694960887493435392	2016-02-03T19:09:21	JoshZumbrun ah, ok, gotcha. It would depend upon whether you think the likelihood of getting a job from unemployment after quitting (1/2)

nick_bunker	694929614926385153	2016-02-03T17:05:06	JoshZumbrun well, remember replacement rate for UI ain’t exactly high &amp; your UI benefits will run out eventually
nick_bunker	694928174635941888	2016-02-03T16:59:22	JoshZumbrun if UI increases the propensity to quit &amp; employer knows it, then that increases worker bargaining power
nick_bunker	694927720711614470	2016-02-03T16:57:34	ModeledBehavior salimfurth agreed. Outright, total ban would be too blunt.
nick_bunker	694927558928961536	2016-02-03T16:56:55	JoshZumbrun also could improve job-worker matching efficiency which also helps wage growth
nick_bunker	694927377781121025	2016-02-03T16:56:12	JoshZumbrun agreed, I think in the absence of a tighter labor market, increased access to UI would improve leverage
nick_bunker	694927023895089152	2016-02-03T16:54:48	JoshZumbrun I don’t think quitting itself is good but rather we should seek to recreate the situations where people feel like they can quit
nick_bunker	694926468586037249	2016-02-03T16:52:35	ModeledBehavior salimfurth yes, in some instances. They just should be pared back significantly.

nick_bunker	694924750448152576	2016-02-03T16:45:46	UI needs an overhaul, like, yesterday. Just a wildly complex system with tons of gaps that unemployed workers fall through.
