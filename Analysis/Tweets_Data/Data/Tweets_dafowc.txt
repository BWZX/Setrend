dafowc	726006326120308736	2016-04-29T11:12:51	Someone about to criticize me over predictive text fail. B/c they're experiencing cognitive dissonance, will grasp at any empty diversion.
dafowc	726004806381395968	2016-04-29T11:06:49	PiffleRMe b/c you're certainly not here to learn from me. Ask yourself what you're real objectives are and why i would bother to help you
dafowc	726004367959162880	2016-04-29T11:05:04	PiffleRMe what would be the point of that exactly? Use conflict to ameliorate your insecurity? Give you platform for further embarrassment?
dafowc	725678011815739392	2016-04-28T13:28:15	PiffleRMe and that's enough for me. Educate yourself. I hope you find peace as you grow.
dafowc	725677755958960128	2016-04-28T13:27:14	PiffleRMe I don't disagree that theory of mind is incomplete, but it's also true and compatible. You'll realize it someday. .
dafowc	725677430141280259	2016-04-28T13:25:56	PiffleRMe fwiw, you clearly don't apprehend the topic with sufficient depth. Just rationalizing what you want to be true.
dafowc	725676851411226624	2016-04-28T13:23:38	PiffleRMe you are advertising your insecurity about your intelligence and education. Know that. Discreditable.
dafowc	725639129686523905	2016-04-28T10:53:44	PiffleRMe but do what you will. The science is there for you to learn. Growing up is hard.
dafowc	725638746046103553	2016-04-28T10:52:13	PiffleRMe worse, a transparently insecure statement. "I don't have to do learn because iamverysmart, see? See?".  Unimpressive.
dafowc	725638263403368448	2016-04-28T10:50:18	PiffleRMe it's saying b/c you took an undergrad degree you understand all scientific argument. Ridiculous. Makes you look dumb.
dafowc	725346722940096512	2016-04-27T15:31:49	PiffleRMe but it doesn't solve that. only ppl who think a B.S. works as appeal to authority are college kids. outs you as inexperienced
dafowc	725328812922273793	2016-04-27T14:20:39	PiffleRMe believe me, Fathers of the Church well understood these 'mind tricks'. there's nothing about them that undermines the Holy Church
dafowc	725328398973808640	2016-04-27T14:19:00	PiffleRMe dismissal of truths as 'mind tricks' b/c don't like/understand implications is exactly how people work against their own advocacy
dafowc	725327931799654400	2016-04-27T14:17:09	PiffleRMe Catholicism doesn't need to stand against what we know to be true to be relevant. just the opposite, in fact.
dafowc	725327571181789184	2016-04-27T14:15:43	PiffleRMe but here's one line from my resume: Catholic. you don't have to convince me of the merits of institutional religion.
dafowc	725327265979064320	2016-04-27T14:14:30	PiffleRMe you don't have to give me your resume. i'll evaluate your argument on its merits, not yours.
dafowc	725327078439145472	2016-04-27T14:13:46	PiffleRMe no, premise is false b/c there is now plenty of evidence in neuroscience that altruism is hardwired.

dafowc	725016239312130048	2016-04-26T17:38:36	PiffleRMe in this case, the need is survival in civilization as opposed to tribalism ScottAdamsSays johndurant
dafowc	725015870062354432	2016-04-26T17:37:08	PiffleRMe that is source of religious construction. We invent assumptions we need to reach conclusions we need ScottAdamsSays johndurant
dafowc	725014984527339520	2016-04-26T17:33:37	PiffleRMe a priori makes immense diff in conclusion of reasoning. So we use conclusions to reach assumptions ScottAdamsSays johndurant
dafowc	725013889356812288	2016-04-26T17:29:15	PiffleRMe altruism part of our hardwiring. But that goes to ScottAdamsSays point that reason is just rationalizing our nature johndurant
dafowc	724989925590982656	2016-04-26T15:54:02	PiffleRMe which is why we have always been tasked in religion with transcending our mean nature ScottAdamsSays johndurant
dafowc	724989744485158912	2016-04-26T15:53:19	PiffleRMe implying that God built us as moral agents? Perhaps, but that's not how our nature is optimized ScottAdamsSays johndurant
dafowc	724949132658495488	2016-04-26T13:11:56	PiffleRMe all ScottAdamsSays is observing is that human nature is derived with different ends in mind than morality is. johndurant
dafowc	724948410567135232	2016-04-26T13:09:04	PiffleRMe yes, but key observation is that human control system is built with other ends in mind ScottAdamsSays johndurant
