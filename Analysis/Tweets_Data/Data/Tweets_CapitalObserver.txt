CapitalObserver	684400758712889345	2016-01-05T15:47:11	And another one. The consensus is becoming very cozy  
CapitalObserver	684400390289358848	2016-01-05T15:45:43	hmeisler I agree. SPX doesn't want to go down. Its being dragged kicking and screaming
CapitalObserver	684400114866192384	2016-01-05T15:44:37	At some point Europe will gain its footing (possibly at lower levels). At that point i believe SPX will rip
CapitalObserver	684399916425342976	2016-01-05T15:43:50	From where I sit Europe is the biggest problem for the SPX. DAX down 6% YTD in USD. Hard for SPX to rally when that happens
CapitalObserver	684397862101344257	2016-01-05T15:35:40	sharkbiotech gavparks And EWG down 2% today so roughly tracking DAX
CapitalObserver	684391279791325184	2016-01-05T15:09:31	IWM trying to make up some of yesterdays underperformance
CapitalObserver	684387283206815745	2016-01-05T14:53:38	I think everyone playing defense which is typically a good thing for the market. I'm feeling quite bullish &amp; positioned that way
CapitalObserver	684372134630682625	2016-01-05T13:53:26	17thStCap I hate the blaming algos excuse though. But more important that they did well for investors so not taking anything away
CapitalObserver	684367248052629504	2016-01-05T13:34:01	NorthmanTrader When the sell side is saying buy the dip is over you do the opposite.
CapitalObserver	684360761095925760	2016-01-05T13:08:14	sharkbiotech gavparks EWG was down 1.5% between Europe close on Thursday &amp; US close. EWG -2.41% yesterday &amp; another 0.86% this morning
CapitalObserver	684359698464784384	2016-01-05T13:04:01	gavparks DAX actually down 1% in USD this morning still. 6% YTD with SPX down 1%
CapitalObserver	684311455274024961	2016-01-05T09:52:19	gavparks I think we need to decouple from Europe. Europe is too overloved and could be weak
CapitalObserver	684306711486828544	2016-01-05T09:33:28	So China was able to close flat and Europe can't hold a gain after collapsing yesterday?
CapitalObserver	684128540854476804	2016-01-04T21:45:29	gavparks I'm guessing long IWM / short SPY works for rest of Jan
CapitalObserver	684127384845578241	2016-01-04T21:40:53	gavparks I thought small caps were supposed to outperform in January
CapitalObserver	684125876288647168	2016-01-04T21:34:54	Is it me or did a lot of stocks sit out that last hour rally

CapitalObserver	684069798167363584	2016-01-04T17:52:03	All the green stocks on my screen are 2015 losers
CapitalObserver	684068950993408000	2016-01-04T17:48:41	hmeisler sharkbiotech The China news gave it a great excuse to sell off if it wanted to. They do a lot of biz there
CapitalObserver	684065313361625088	2016-01-04T17:34:14	michaelsantoli modestproposal1 I remember from my stats class that you get a decent estimate from what seems like a small sample
CapitalObserver	684049615881158660	2016-01-04T16:31:52	DAX down 5% in USD to start the new year
CapitalObserver	684048525148172288	2016-01-04T16:27:32	gavparks Amen
CapitalObserver	684036775443062784	2016-01-04T15:40:50	They buying puts hand over fist at ISE today. ISEE total 51, equity only 90. They very good at closing door after horses have left
CapitalObserver	684034307426533377	2016-01-04T15:31:02	FANG stocks down about 5% on average today. Looks like people wanted to wait until 2016 to take profits to defer taxes a year
CapitalObserver	684030805035872260	2016-01-04T15:17:07	EricSteiman sharkbiotech My argument is that the 7X earnings ex-cash valuation accounts for that but its a moot point. Wouldnt buy yet
CapitalObserver	684018550273617921	2016-01-04T14:28:25	sharkbiotech EricSteiman I don't disagree
CapitalObserver	684018137117921280	2016-01-04T14:26:46	EricSteiman sharkbiotech One can argue the sustainable revenue stream deserves a higher than market multiple
CapitalObserver	684017926198980608	2016-01-04T14:25:56	sharkbiotech I'm just taking an axe to it to prove a point but I still wouldn't step in here
CapitalObserver	684017537445675008	2016-01-04T14:24:24	sharkbiotech Even if long term EPS are $6 &amp; you stick a market multiple on that and add cash you get over $120
CapitalObserver	684016837823205376	2016-01-04T14:21:37	sharkbiotech Long term i think AAPL is cheap because even once numbers get cut valuation low but no reason to step in front
CapitalObserver	684016243733598208	2016-01-04T14:19:15	jonsticha Equal weight has been outperforming forever as megacaps went from a huge premium in 2000 to a huge discount in 2014
CapitalObserver	684015063137685504	2016-01-04T14:14:34	sharkbiotech There's not a sell side analyst out there that doesn't think they will lower numbers. Question is if retail is ready for it
CapitalObserver	684012957085380609	2016-01-04T14:06:11	Unfortunately switching the calendar to 2016 has not helped one bit

CapitalObserver	683985160640020480	2016-01-04T12:15:44	DAX is down 4.5% this morning. How much longer will we need to hear about how everyone is overweight Europe?
CapitalObserver	683975000890675200	2016-01-04T11:35:22	ZoomZoomDoom I don't know. I would have to see when we get there
CapitalObserver	683970600516370432	2016-01-04T11:17:53	ZoomZoomDoom No options. I don't have a stop loss in mind

CapitalObserver	683968683648094208	2016-01-04T11:10:16	bobbyshea62 Not sure why it matters. We don't really compete with China nor sell that much stuff there
CapitalObserver	683968458225266689	2016-01-04T11:09:22	ZoomZoomDoom This is a trade although I do have a core long. Holding a lot of March bullish risk/reversals &amp; some beat up names
CapitalObserver	683966761939644416	2016-01-04T11:02:38	Bought SPY into the happy new year mess
CapitalObserver	683789032313221120	2016-01-03T23:16:24	sharkbiotech These days a war between Saudi &amp; Iran means who can pump more oil to screw the other one

CapitalObserver	683645203551514624	2016-01-03T13:44:52	Now just an unwinding of the late year plunge puts the under invested behind the 8-ball to start the year
CapitalObserver	683645146165047296	2016-01-03T13:44:39	2015 closing on a down note was the worst thing that could happen to the bears
CapitalObserver	683644158146383872	2016-01-03T13:40:43	Kenaschmidt Those were the best times to get long
CapitalObserver	683644034376699904	2016-01-03T13:40:13	Kenaschmidt There were periods where people became very bearish. All the Europe scares especially 2011, taper tantrum etc.
CapitalObserver	683636020043198468	2016-01-03T13:08:23	Fundamentally I agree with the bears. High valuations, late cycle, leverage, credit cracking etc. But too many people singing the same tune
CapitalObserver	683635739448504320	2016-01-03T13:07:16	Would be a lot easier for me to join the bearish camp if we rallied in first few months of the year &amp; sucked in all the newly minted bears
CapitalObserver	683635223167381505	2016-01-03T13:05:13	The vast majority of the 2016 forecasts I have seen have been bearish (other than perma bulls). That is the most bullish thing out there
CapitalObserver	683430418285228032	2016-01-02T23:31:23	If this investing thing doesn't pan out I'm going to try and convince BarbarianCap to open a restaurant with me
