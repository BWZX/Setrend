george_cooper__	724136424702926848	2016-04-24T07:22:32	georgemagnus1 thanks but it's the flippers I'm interested in. I suspect few of those.
george_cooper__	724135465096458240	2016-04-24T07:18:43	deonopperman6 that one I've missed entirely. I will ask a friend.
george_cooper__	724135210326065152	2016-04-24T07:17:42	deonopperman6 I doubt it's moved the needle at all. Just hardened existing positions &amp; telling that no European can be drafted for +ve case
george_cooper__	724133664767008768	2016-04-24T07:11:34	LondonAnalyst but I guess no vote shift? So far I know of one vote flip (into Brexit camp)
george_cooper__	724131337305767936	2016-04-24T07:02:19	Out of interest: has anyone shifted their opinion on Brexit following Obama's speech, in either direction?
george_cooper__	724104716620292096	2016-04-24T05:16:32	george_cooper__ Poor policy (endog) exacerbating normal cycles (exog). Delay the inevitable and the inevitable becomes worse.

george_cooper__	723896656626913280	2016-04-23T15:29:46	deonopperman6 oh I agree. I just think the insights are now so deeply buried, rewritten &amp; distorted that there's little recoverable value
