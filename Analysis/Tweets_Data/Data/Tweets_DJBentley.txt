DJBentley	230525080923430913	2012-08-01T04:47:16	parislemon Prediction time... I think FB may hover around $17-18 with current projection. Mid-term $24. Not stellar price movement...
DJBentley	230523948444549120	2012-08-01T04:42:46	If Facebook hits $20, I'm buying.  I haven't owned a pubic stock in a long time.
