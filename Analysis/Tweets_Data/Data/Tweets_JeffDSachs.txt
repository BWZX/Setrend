JeffDSachs	717819038160838658	2016-04-06T20:59:29	ofernandezfdez FYI, I was a social democrat then and now. Please see p. 88 of this 1989 interview: 
JeffDSachs	717818036552667136	2016-04-06T20:55:30	christe4  HRC's foreign policy record is awful.  She had the chance to pursue peaceful solutions as Secretary of State but did otherwise.
JeffDSachs	717816236474765312	2016-04-06T20:48:21	christe4 I judge candidates by their records: what they supported, opposed, advocated, rejected.  She has consistently been for war.
JeffDSachs	717815123776249856	2016-04-06T20:43:56	christe4 Please read a little bit.  She was a major cheerleader for the bombing.  Called Bill to encourage him.
JeffDSachs	717814986547073024	2016-04-06T20:43:23	benjaminkatzeff Thanks.  I'll read this too.  It's a very important topic.  I greatly admire Sweden! Like how it ticks.
JeffDSachs	717814438875820033	2016-04-06T20:41:13	christe4 All supported by her.  Should we be impressed?  What a miserable record and poor judgment.
JeffDSachs	717813911593086976	2016-04-06T20:39:07	benjaminkatzeff Thanks.  I'll read it with interest.
JeffDSachs	717813681443237888	2016-04-06T20:38:12	christe4  Serbia bombing, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Libya. NATO enlargement. CIA supporter, buddy of Saudis. Warmonger. No thanks.
JeffDSachs	717809556827598848	2016-04-06T20:21:49	benjaminkatzeff Yes it is.  Social democracy is one of the greatest innovations of modern history.
JeffDSachs	717805012164943872	2016-04-06T20:03:45	benjaminkatzeff Did you actually read what I said?  I said that I prefer a system like Sweden's.
JeffDSachs	717804633318690816	2016-04-06T20:02:15	benjaminkatzeff I did not advocate a "free financial system." I advocated a market financial system, with regulations.  Of course.

JeffDSachs	717802242712215552	2016-04-06T19:52:45	christe4 Her foreign policy record is one of the worst in modern US history.  War, war, war, and war.
JeffDSachs	717801798623477760	2016-04-06T19:50:59	kitcatjam prema46 SenSanders Hillary is for war and Wall Street.  Enough of that already.  It's corrupted the Democrats since 1992.
