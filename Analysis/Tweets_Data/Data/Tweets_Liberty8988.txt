Liberty8988	722582861811814401	2016-04-20T00:29:13	BKBrockway BluegrassCap true, but I’d say everything in the markets much more developed than it was

Liberty8988	722573048684019712	2016-04-19T23:50:14	BluegrassCap ie. Why isn’t everyone who read about Teledyne doing what Singleton did? Because actually much harder in practice than theory
Liberty8988	722572839178489856	2016-04-19T23:49:24	BluegrassCap I hope I’m not misunderstanding your question. I think there’s rarely a real moat around a model, usually around execution
Liberty8988	722572482230640640	2016-04-19T23:47:59	SkeleCap jay_21_ BluegrassCap yeah, but what they do fairly obvious, so why isn’t everyone else doing it too? I think it’s just hard…
Liberty8988	722571950342610945	2016-04-19T23:45:52	BluegrassCap agreed, but goes back to “why isn’t X doing better?” Answer probably: Because they’re not good enough.
