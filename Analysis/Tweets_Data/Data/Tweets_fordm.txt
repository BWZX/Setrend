fordm	724114036313350144	2016-04-24T05:53:34	rhcm123 Totally. But I can forgive a lot of that for a soft reboot far, far away from the prequels.

fordm	724027795853201408	2016-04-24T00:10:52	There's a pothole on your street. You tell an alderman you want it fixed. Imagine if he replied, "Oh? With what kind of asphalt slurry?"
fordm	724026507165728768	2016-04-24T00:05:45	Is he going to let BLM activists draft legislation or negotiate consent decrees? At some point, elected officials have to take initiative.
fordm	724024260910440448	2016-04-23T23:56:50	Beyond that, what's really strange here is how much of the onus for crafting policy he puts on activists, not elected officials.
fordm	724022540130115584	2016-04-23T23:49:59	Not that he doesn't have a role, of course. But very little of the U.S. criminal-justice system is run by the White House.
fordm	724022144754032640	2016-04-23T23:48:25	Plenty of BLM activism has pushed for substantive, specific changes. But most of those changes aren't for Obama to make.

fordm	697318959779975168	2016-02-10T07:19:30	Trump could appoint more Kennedys than Scalias, for example. But he's also more likely to defy the Supreme Court if it ruled against him.

fordm	697314426714611712	2016-02-10T07:01:29	Sanders' win is historic. But he poses far fewer challenges to American civic fabric than Trump does.
