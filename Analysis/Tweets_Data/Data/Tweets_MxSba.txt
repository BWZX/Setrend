MxSba	719887128184926208	2016-04-12T13:57:20	AnnaDi_Mario fwred I read German media too you know. Anyway, go and tell CDU members Weidmann is their next FinMin. Please record it ;-)
MxSba	719886643499507712	2016-04-12T13:55:25	China is ONLY major economy with IMF growth forecasts revised up. Rest got cut. 
MxSba	719884262309249024	2016-04-12T13:45:57	AnnaDi_Mario fwred Friedrich, Tillmann, von der Leyen, to name a few potential examples. Really, forget about Weidmann.
MxSba	719882817220567040	2016-04-12T13:40:13	AnnaDi_Mario fwred I still don't get it: why Weidmann? There's plenty of other CDU people able to take over from Schaeuble.
MxSba	719877888909160450	2016-04-12T13:20:38	AnnaDi_Mario fwred well to do so he has to become at least a CDU heavyweight. Don't see how especially is such short notice. Not happening
MxSba	719875833188507648	2016-04-12T13:12:27	AnnaDi_Mario fwred Tricky but too soon to rule him out. In any case, he has more chance to become ECB head than CDU heavyweight.
MxSba	719873783708983296	2016-04-12T13:04:19	AnnaDi_Mario fwred your argument works for Asmussen, not Weidmann. Also: remember Germany has been long waiting for ECB presidency...
MxSba	719872041961287680	2016-04-12T12:57:24	AnnaDi_Mario fwred So assuming Weidmann is as he is because he wants to be elected Chancellor in the future is just plain wrong IMHO.
MxSba	719871772141731840	2016-04-12T12:56:19	AnnaDi_Mario fwred And I don't know if you have met him but he's no politician at all. And that's what makes him a good central banker.
MxSba	719871409867091968	2016-04-12T12:54:53	AnnaDi_Mario fwred yes, but he went to Buba after the Kanlzei. He didn't take a government position. He made a clear choice.
MxSba	719869775367823360	2016-04-12T12:48:23	AnnaDi_Mario fwred I knew it. Disagree: he has no political profile, little party connection. And Buba officials don't go into politics.
