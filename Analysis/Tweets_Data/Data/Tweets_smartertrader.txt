smartertrader	721904880470921216	2016-04-18T03:35:10	BrianGooding and Amzn misses earnings and stk at 540.
smartertrader	721904801555038209	2016-04-18T03:34:51	BrianGooding that would be real bad for Amzn.  If you can start and stop streaming and get free shipping then you only get during Christmas
smartertrader	721904444095537152	2016-04-18T03:33:26	Jersey_Drew I understand that your just telling me.  May be bezo's is a genius. And the get 1m to pay for streaming w no free shipping.
smartertrader	721903907732070401	2016-04-18T03:31:18	Jersey_Drew that makes 0 sense.  Completely stupid.  Pay more for streaming 108 then for prime .. Free shipping and streaming.   Ok.  Lol.
smartertrader	721902225740689408	2016-04-18T03:24:37	Remember lots of stupid exists.  How many will get standalone Amzn streaming and pay more the prime lol.

smartertrader	721901662047182848	2016-04-18T03:22:23	So I'm confused.  Amzn prime 99 bucks.  Amzn stand alone streaming i9 x 12 or 108.  So costs more then prime w free shipping and streaming

smartertrader	702332993730269184	2016-02-24T03:23:29	Bullshark_2012 petenajarian just like they were accurate yesterday.  Bet in next 30 days exposure levels 3x at GS ms bac
smartertrader	702332706672103424	2016-02-24T03:22:20	Bullshark_2012 petenajarian jpm makes 20 a yr profit of they lose 45b due to oil they make no profit for 2 yrs.  so stk at 20
smartertrader	702332482083901440	2016-02-24T03:21:27	Bullshark_2012 petenajarian never said Jpm or GS are fraud.  Saying they are not divulging 100% of risk....
smartertrader	702332043087077377	2016-02-24T03:19:42	Bullshark_2012 so did all of leh loans. And so did all Enron financials.  Rock solid
smartertrader	702331616656371712	2016-02-24T03:18:00	Let's see.  in 30 days jmp goes from everything great &amp; 5b in exposure to 45b 25% down invest fees and 20% down rev and you think fine

smartertrader	702330464078426112	2016-02-24T03:13:25	Bullshark_2012 petenajarian in 2008 leh and bear sterns had rah rah meeting and 75% of managers thought all was fine All clueless managers
smartertrader	702330145705586690	2016-02-24T03:12:10	Bullshark_2012 I like you.  But listen.  Pretty sure I'm smarter than 95% of every manager above you all way to CEO.
smartertrader	702329738992308224	2016-02-24T03:10:33	Bullshark_2012 petenajarian department books can be cooked so easily on backs it's really pretty sad.
smartertrader	702329581663944704	2016-02-24T03:09:55	Bullshark_2012 petenajarian not picking on you. So if your a big wig making 1m a yr at bank and you know you get fired do you disclose
smartertrader	702329313224294400	2016-02-24T03:08:51	Bullshark_2012 petenajarian Let me tell you, Your young, so Learn you really don't have clue.  Just like no one knew about London whale
smartertrader	702328440641302528	2016-02-24T03:05:23	chute75llc lol

smartertrader	702327505147932672	2016-02-24T03:01:40	Bullshark_2012 petenajarian not a chance. If you believe that your severely mistaken.
smartertrader	702327290856800256	2016-02-24T03:00:49	Agree 100%.  If Saudi owns the derivatives the want oil at 20. They get 50 trillion  
smartertrader	702326995531669504	2016-02-24T02:59:38	Can't make up stupid.  if Chesapeake misses payment on mar 15 this will start the bankruptcy's in oil and could have a 1000 pt down day
smartertrader	702326290645299200	2016-02-24T02:56:50	All these oil ministers are complete idiots.   If the Saudi guy says nothing oil stays up.  What's to gain by saying no cut.  Why comment.
smartertrader	702325955600121856	2016-02-24T02:55:31	And if oil breaks 26. Run. Spx 1700 fast.   Why because no one trusts exposure.  If chase says 45b. I bet it's 90.
smartertrader	702325672535056384	2016-02-24T02:54:23	So let's see. Chase says bad..  Now the day gs ms citi bac all have to disclose too. That's 4 huge down days coming.
smartertrader	702325309043904512	2016-02-24T02:52:56	If you got f'ed last crisis by banks or know someone who did. Would you let this happen again..Only fast money fools keep saying banks fine
smartertrader	702324944957370369	2016-02-24T02:51:30	If GS investment bank fees down 25%.  Here comes 130 fast.   And the next crisis.   Only the truly stupid buy banks now
smartertrader	702324697489215488	2016-02-24T02:50:31	Chase says investment bank fees Down 25% this q and revenue down 20% while taking Charges for reserves. Why is this not down 10.
smartertrader	702324260266573825	2016-02-24T02:48:46	The CEO of banks know there is no real reason to disclose.   Just like bear sterns and leh till their final days kept saying all good
smartertrader	702323843927379968	2016-02-24T02:47:07	Jpm lied   Now came clean.  From little exposure to 45b. GS next .. Pretty sure at oil 20 bucks tons of banks can get slaughtered
smartertrader	702187441994661888	2016-02-23T17:45:06	who cares about pe   stephanie   needs  counseling  on fast money  meaningless  gpro pe  was 1/2  what it was at 90   at 45   silly people

smartertrader	702178431656562688	2016-02-23T17:09:18	petenajarian it fine to differ..if oil at 18  jpm under 30   and he can buy more      NOT SAYING  oil under 20   but massive risk
smartertrader	702178104140128256	2016-02-23T17:08:00	petenajarian jpm HAS  45B EXPOSURE   19b high risk   they have 1.5b  if  oil at 20  JPM loses  20b  they make 20b a yr  so no earnings
smartertrader	702177778976722944	2016-02-23T17:06:42	petenajarian LEH ceo bought tons stk too so did bear sterns ceo. Dimon buy meaning less he betting oil doesnt break 26 at 20 jpm 35 bucks
smartertrader	702152391991259138	2016-02-23T15:25:50	NOW remember  exposure  doesnt means  they get triggered
