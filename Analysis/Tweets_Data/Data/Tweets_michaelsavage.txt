michaelsavage	711860146574639104	2016-03-21T10:20:59	Still think one of most egregious moves by Osborne in botchedbudget was corp tax manipulation, which gives him 60% of his 2019-20 surplus.

michaelsavage	710935468796469248	2016-03-18T21:06:38	Iain Duncan Smith resigns over disability cuts row. His resignation is aimed directly at Osborne for slashing welfare for political reasons.
michaelsavage	710927587468570624	2016-03-18T20:35:19	Interesting Osborne has acted so quickly - clear attempt to learn from 2012 Budget backlash. But a bracing weekend ahead for the chancellor.

michaelsavage	710496899233619968	2016-03-17T16:03:55	Part of Osborne's problem - some Tories backed other welfare cuts this month thinking the disabled could rely on PIP. Undermined by new cut

michaelsavage	710108815191117824	2016-03-16T14:21:49	Basically, Osborne has delayed loads of income - replacing it with more borrowing in years he's already borrowing - to protect that surplus.
