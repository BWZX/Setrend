katienotopoulos	711223811274907648	2016-03-19T16:12:25	GovernorGhoul the issue is the system right now allows predators to exploit vulnerable people

katienotopoulos	687715410507108353	2016-01-14T19:18:25	josiahhughes both definitions are acceptable in american slang
katienotopoulos	687710726862061568	2016-01-14T18:59:48	JoshThorne Sneakernets it just seems like american 80s schoolyard slang and fin de ciecle british colonial slang might not be related
katienotopoulos	687710340587585536	2016-01-14T18:58:16	JoshThorne Sneakernets no i know, i‚Äôm just skeptical of the claim that the two usages are linked and not coincidental
katienotopoulos	687709595087810560	2016-01-14T18:55:19	JoshThorne Sneakernets people are telling me the penis version is actually ‚Äúchode"

katienotopoulos	687706213656715264	2016-01-14T18:41:52	JoshThorne huh never heard that. it‚Äôs sort of like a reverse schmuck, where it meant penis first then applied to people
katienotopoulos	687705972224167936	2016-01-14T18:40:55	JoshThorne people also use choad for ‚Äútaint‚Äù, it seems like the word may just have several meanings?
katienotopoulos	687705822193926148	2016-01-14T18:40:19	Bernstein hmmmm not so sure about that eventi
katienotopoulos	687705560469385221	2016-01-14T18:39:17	Has anyone seen a choad (a weener that is wider than it is long) in the wild?
