ZachLowe_NBA	726244955203719169	2016-04-30T03:01:04	That was a "find a way" win for Heat. Every possession was a grind-- Dragic going around screens 2- 3 times to find anything. Wade 3s. Wow.

ZachLowe_NBA	724241793039130624	2016-04-24T14:21:13	Blake looked weirdly tentative to roll on PNRs during his short stint at C. POR defended those plays well, but he seemed a little off.
ZachLowe_NBA	724241486531944450	2016-04-24T14:20:00	Super smart Hack-DJ by Stotts when DJ got the under 2-min at the elbow. Harkless made Clips pay for playing Jamal at SF.

ZachLowe_NBA	723870676910768129	2016-04-23T13:46:32	Given ATL's non-interest in ORBs, wonder if Stevens plays Jerebko at C even more. ATL has to find a way to post up, use size.
ZachLowe_NBA	723870443812347904	2016-04-23T13:45:37	Incredible stuff from The Little Guy last night. BOS struck perfect balance b/w having him on and off ball. Roasted Teague.

ZachLowe_NBA	723688926423179264	2016-04-23T01:44:20	Solano_56 Last 5 mins was either LBJ PNR after dribbling a ton, or Kyrie PNR after dribbling a ton, basically. Some exceptions, obviously
ZachLowe_NBA	723688712203341824	2016-04-23T01:43:29	Was fascinating to see the Pistons play LeBron like the '13 Spurs in Finals. He made some Js, but has to get full confidence back ASAP.
ZachLowe_NBA	723688397462757376	2016-04-23T01:42:14	Pistons will regret that loose ball Thompson just picked up, and then Reggie falling over -- both in last 2:30 or so. But they fought hard.
ZachLowe_NBA	723688295457296384	2016-04-23T01:41:49	DET made that really fun. CLE's offense got a bit gummy w/ the your-turn, my-turn vibe late, but they scored enough.
ZachLowe_NBA	723688115370602496	2016-04-23T01:41:06	wayneosborne18 He was great. Are you pretending he wasn't barking at everyone late in the season? B/c even coaches said he was.
ZachLowe_NBA	723536138636419072	2016-04-22T15:37:12	ebehoops I may not be as sedentary as you think, amigo. But they did put me in the freezing chamber, and I can confirm it was freezing.
ZachLowe_NBA	723531970320330752	2016-04-22T15:20:38	And I've written how Favors is the most explosive big P3 has ever tested by some measures. But as TH notes, not all! 
ZachLowe_NBA	723531768129671168	2016-04-22T15:19:50	Great stuff from Tom. I visit P3 every year, at least once, and those guys are beyond impressive.  
ZachLowe_NBA	723501269822787584	2016-04-22T13:18:39	Obvious problem w/ going small is that it means Dirk is either sitting, or playing center against a brute like Kanter or Adams.
ZachLowe_NBA	723501138864017408	2016-04-22T13:18:08	Wes + JA have played only 10 mins together total. DAL obviously wants multiple handlers, but might try more of this --maybe in small lineups
ZachLowe_NBA	723500458652790785	2016-04-22T13:15:25	DAL hasn't been able to score, period, but: Dirk on court: 94 points/100 possessions. On bench: (gulp) 78. Adjustment for Rick: Clone Dirk!
ZachLowe_NBA	723233038822330368	2016-04-21T19:32:48	ICYMI yesterday: tomhaberstroh + I bounce around the playoffs, including a bunch of stuff on OKC-Mavs ahead of G3: 
ZachLowe_NBA	723158820457844737	2016-04-21T14:37:53	Should the Bulls have tried harder to keep the man behind the Benny mask? I say yes. 
ZachLowe_NBA	723146528152530944	2016-04-21T13:49:02	Thought POR actually tried some interesting anti-trap stuff on offense, but Harkless/Aminu combo just doesn't have enough shooting.
ZachLowe_NBA	723146237948645376	2016-04-21T13:47:53	POR may have to think re trying Plumlee on Blake, even though it screws up ability to switch PNR. If they don't, Clips should post BG more
ZachLowe_NBA	723127586763759620	2016-04-21T12:33:46	Preach, Steve Clifford: 
ZachLowe_NBA	723116319554547712	2016-04-21T11:49:00	DJ has played some of the best defense of his career in this series for the Clips.
ZachLowe_NBA	722953154132873216	2016-04-21T01:00:38	It's only 2Q, but that is the kind of stretch that can cost you a game.
ZachLowe_NBA	722953007642619904	2016-04-21T01:00:03	hank_walker7 Maybe I should pin my official prediction tweets or something.
ZachLowe_NBA	722952846321262594	2016-04-21T00:59:25	I know Harris was in foul trouble, but a LeBron small-ball lineup crushing a Pistons all-bench lineup was...predictable.
ZachLowe_NBA	722952563520344064	2016-04-21T00:58:17	hank_walker7 I picked Heat in 7.

ZachLowe_NBA	722830624546025472	2016-04-20T16:53:45	elandfried This will be discussed. It's a good question.
ZachLowe_NBA	722829791754366976	2016-04-20T16:50:26	This is an interesting discussion heading into G2. tomhaberstroh and I will hit on upcoming pod.

ZachLowe_NBA	722818951290466304	2016-04-20T16:07:21	celticsblog I think it was clear I meant they are going back to Boston, and their home court. But, yeah, accidental double meaning
ZachLowe_NBA	722807785080164352	2016-04-20T15:22:59	On the loss of Avery Bradley, and how the Hawks can relate: 
ZachLowe_NBA	722788163777904640	2016-04-20T14:05:01	Spurs should be nice and at least play knifey-spoony. They even have Patty Mills!

ZachLowe_NBA	722594965617057792	2016-04-20T01:17:19	Congrats to fellow Grantlanders Jpdabrams and billbarnwell on signing new deals. Tremendous talents, better people.
ZachLowe_NBA	722594165108903936	2016-04-20T01:14:08	So much this. 
ZachLowe_NBA	722582188005437440	2016-04-20T00:26:33	If this game gets close, Isaiah needs to play as much as he possibly can. Cs can barely afford to sit him.
ZachLowe_NBA	722581519466962944	2016-04-20T00:23:53	Cs had to try going 5-out, with Jerebko at C, to get any spacing with both Turner and Smart on the floor. Crowder also clearly limited.
ZachLowe_NBA	722581341913673728	2016-04-20T00:23:11	Amazing how much more pronounced lack of shooting can feel in playoffs vs reg season. BOS could not afford to lose one outside shooter (AB)
ZachLowe_NBA	722516883535228928	2016-04-19T20:07:03	NateDuncanNBA I'm going to talk a bit about it tomorrow w/ tomhaberstroh. It was like he wasn't even paying attention to the game.
ZachLowe_NBA	722514664370933761	2016-04-19T19:58:14	steventurous Jared_Wade I never really liked it. It was fine. I kept waiting to love it, never did, hit eject.
ZachLowe_NBA	722513245983096832	2016-04-19T19:52:36	The opposite. Never read one page of books, and punted the show after 3 seasons. Fascinated by show moving ahead 
ZachLowe_NBA	722512809540640770	2016-04-19T19:50:52	This is so weird, it almost makes me want to catch up with the show.  
ZachLowe_NBA	722508597259870208	2016-04-19T19:34:07	Here's Wade doing it (along baseline) in a GIF I had hoped to put in yesterday's column: 
ZachLowe_NBA	722508247106789377	2016-04-19T19:32:44	This piece:  mentions "The Danny Green Cut" thing I wrote on yesterday (at the bottom): 
ZachLowe_NBA	722490521785143297	2016-04-19T18:22:18	So, I have known about this for a while, and kept it quiet, and I am very sad:

ZachLowe_NBA	722477893973078016	2016-04-19T17:32:07	ChrisVernonShow kevinarnovitz Great article, all the Verno loved well-deserved. VERNO IS A TASTE-MAKER
ZachLowe_NBA	722461427290804226	2016-04-19T16:26:41	royceyoung Those are interrelated issues, too. Harder to cut if no one can shoot, all the good territory is cluttered.
ZachLowe_NBA	722461240375844864	2016-04-19T16:25:57	Yes, this is Felton on KD. Good! But no one moved. There is 11 on shot clock. Try to generate another good option 
ZachLowe_NBA	722460142156046336	2016-04-19T16:21:35	Like, if KD has the ball in the post, and the entire D is loaded to him b/c OKC only has 1 other shooter on the floor, SOMEONE FREAKING CUT
ZachLowe_NBA	722459614432862209	2016-04-19T16:19:29	(2/2) But they are all predictable, slow to unfold, and the side players NEVER move/cut/screen.
ZachLowe_NBA	722459489627217920	2016-04-19T16:18:59	(1/2)OKC has 3 basic crunch-time sets: 1. RW spread PNR 2.Some sort of pindown/screen for KD 3.KD/RW PNR. Paradox: Those are all good plays!
ZachLowe_NBA	722458696274599936	2016-04-19T16:15:50	Dion Waiters might as well be sitting down, eating a snack on these crunch-time OKC possessions. Literally does nothing.

ZachLowe_NBA	722437313104605184	2016-04-19T14:50:52	Matthews missed two of the easiest 3s of his season when KD just spaced out and he cut. Watch RW's defense last 5 minutes. Just out of it.
ZachLowe_NBA	722437080756940801	2016-04-19T14:49:56	OKC was "unlucky" in KD having  career-worst night. But their defense was way worse than DAL point total shows. DAL missed ton of open looks
ZachLowe_NBA	722422057917673472	2016-04-19T13:50:15	NicoleAuerbach As a former swimmer/water polo player, do you know how much I want to cover these sports for the Olympics? SO JEALOUS
ZachLowe_NBA	722419278075572225	2016-04-19T13:39:12	Valanciunas took 80 shots directly out of the PNR in 60 regular season games, per Synergy. Took 5 last night. Lowry's passing was great
ZachLowe_NBA	722398926851088384	2016-04-19T12:18:20	Draymond spins past a flat-footed, possibly asleep Harden in the post, Dwight on weak side is like, "Nah." Draymond dunks. Goodbye.
ZachLowe_NBA	722393633043980288	2016-04-19T11:57:18	JonathanTjarks Probably also concerns about Capela guarding PFs, but, again, HOU isn't guarding anyone regardless.
ZachLowe_NBA	722393496716460032	2016-04-19T11:56:45	JonathanTjarks Nothing beyond the obvious -- that it kills their spacing. But so does basically any combo they are using anyway
ZachLowe_NBA	722379352340566016	2016-04-19T11:00:33	Can't be about creating a cross-match, b/c HOU has to know GSW is fine with Draymond on Harden/Iggy on Smith
ZachLowe_NBA	722378708305190913	2016-04-19T10:57:59	Watching HOU-GSW now, very confused immediately why Harden is on Draymond/Josh on Iggy. It's killing HOU, unnecessary w/o Curry PNR threat
ZachLowe_NBA	722261126155788288	2016-04-19T03:10:46	RobertSotelo765 L0rv DarnellMayberry Failing to attack Dirk enough in the PNR, probably not enough opportunistic small-ball.
ZachLowe_NBA	722260589297418240	2016-04-19T03:08:38	RobertSotelo765 L0rv DarnellMayberry Too much Kanter late, too much Roberson, that one horrid non-shooting lineup w/ KD, ATO for RW 3
ZachLowe_NBA	722258884950429696	2016-04-19T03:01:51	The Mavs find weird ways. Not sure we'll ever see KD have a game like that again. Didn't  like Westbrook's D, or some key Donovan decisions.
ZachLowe_NBA	722239063181389824	2016-04-19T01:43:05	CoJo and Patterson have been awesome. Great response by Toronto. Indy may need to play Miles more. Too many non-shooters in 2nd unit.
ZachLowe_NBA	722219159770251264	2016-04-19T00:24:00	Much closer to 56-win Raps. Good energy, random cutting, sneaking around in the gaps. Indy D made mistakes, but good energy creates mistakes

ZachLowe_NBA	721867358487384064	2016-04-18T01:06:04	Heat's energy and physicality were overwhelming today. Every time CHA goes "down" a position -- Lin at SG, Lee at SF -- MIA can punish.
ZachLowe_NBA	721830788313047040	2016-04-17T22:40:45	Was kinda cool to see LBJ hand the keys to the crunch-time offense to the Kyrie/Love PNR for so long. Lue better go back to Love at C

ZachLowe_NBA	721794867303706625	2016-04-17T20:18:01	DET obviously not gonna keep shooting like this, but not an encouraging start for CLE's mission of locking down the D in playoffs.

ZachLowe_NBA	721013668205334528	2016-04-15T16:33:48	What up, Beck/Becks 
ZachLowe_NBA	721006286410612736	2016-04-15T16:04:28	For rapid-fire analysis of the other 7 series (whoops!), coachthorpe joined the Lowe Post yesterday evening: 
ZachLowe_NBA	721005934923816960	2016-04-15T16:03:05	lloyd145 I apologize for the error.
ZachLowe_NBA	721005775619919873	2016-04-15T16:02:27	YUNGBOMBAYPAPI Because, as I tweeted yesterday and today, I broke down every other matchup on a pod yesterday.
ZachLowe_NBA	721005611068960769	2016-04-15T16:01:47	DET is also pretty well-suited to deal w/ LBJ at PF w/o rejiggering their lineup. Does Lue have guts to do that, plus Love or Frye at C?
ZachLowe_NBA	721005382491963392	2016-04-15T16:00:53	Will CLE ever resort to hacking Drummond? SVG has played Baynes more, and longer, when that happens.
ZachLowe_NBA	721005197170843649	2016-04-15T16:00:09	Nickyds23 Having written frequently about that, I'm aware.
ZachLowe_NBA	721004957193768960	2016-04-15T15:59:12	patriots2345 I already did, on a podcast yesterday.
ZachLowe_NBA	721004873626443776	2016-04-15T15:58:52	Does SVG have to leave 2 starters w/ bench units, especially if CLE has both Kyrie and Love on floor when LBJ rests? Can DET bench survive?
ZachLowe_NBA	721004382469246976	2016-04-15T15:56:55	Is Drummond ready to fight, every game, every possession, against Thompson -- a dude who does nothing but fight?
ZachLowe_NBA	721004235756732416	2016-04-15T15:56:20	DET well suited to switch LBJ-Love PNR. Can Harris stick w/ LBJ at all on switches? Can Love gain any traction in the post/elbows?
ZachLowe_NBA	721003910454841344	2016-04-15T15:55:02	DET-CLE thoughts: How often will PGs guard each other? Any cross-matches to exploit in transition? Shump on RJ may happen more than expected

ZachLowe_NBA	720654857917624320	2016-04-14T16:48:01	jazziliad I don't think I matter. I do think it makes for an interesting column that people read. It's really not that complicated.
ZachLowe_NBA	720653957807386625	2016-04-14T16:44:27	TheRobVera I mean, it's just hoops, but it's pretty high-level hair-splitting. Imperfect exercise for sure.
ZachLowe_NBA	720653553359040512	2016-04-14T16:42:50	TimBontemps I'm kinda jealous you snuck LMA in.
ZachLowe_NBA	720653385570066432	2016-04-14T16:42:10	And the brains at CBS made their choices here:  Votes are rolling in.
ZachLowe_NBA	720653314594103296	2016-04-14T16:41:53	Excited to see where Tim ended up. His awards pieces have been interesting/thoughtful.  
ZachLowe_NBA	720653131969916928	2016-04-14T16:41:10	TheRobVera It's hard.
ZachLowe_NBA	720652764200755200	2016-04-14T16:39:42	TimBontemps Did you put our your All-NBA teams yet?
ZachLowe_NBA	720651861875945472	2016-04-14T16:36:07	AndymanLees It was a hard choice. Defense -- and that stat you picked is a bad one -- and team culture matter, too.
ZachLowe_NBA	720651598872100864	2016-04-14T16:35:04	jarg0naut There is room for polite disagreement on things like this. It was a hard decision.

ZachLowe_NBA	720635430681645056	2016-04-14T15:30:50	This is what I said on TheJump the other day -- that CHI team played Rodman at C more than people remember 
ZachLowe_NBA	720616367335059456	2016-04-14T14:15:05	MPrvan You're asking someone who mentioned him in my MIP analysis, so...
ZachLowe_NBA	720612987346817024	2016-04-14T14:01:39	When the conspiracy is finally revealed, remember this, everyone: it starts with the 12:30 pm tip time for Game 1. CSM sets it.
ZachLowe_NBA	720612752281235457	2016-04-14T14:00:43	Playoffs haven't started, and I already have TOR fans tweeting at me about the NBA's massive conspiracy against Raptors. MULDER TDOT BRANCH

ZachLowe_NBA	720352561774125056	2016-04-13T20:46:48	NicByerley You realize you could have signed those free agents w/o making that trade, right?
ZachLowe_NBA	720352092867592193	2016-04-13T20:44:57	NicByerley Sure thing. That Philly trade was great. Showed a top-notch knowledge of the cap. Lost picks means nothing. Kool-aid.
ZachLowe_NBA	720351529941786624	2016-04-13T20:42:42	NicByerley So stable, he made a farce of a trade w/ Philly, screwed up free agency so badly they're about to hire a real GM.
ZachLowe_NBA	720347800463142912	2016-04-13T20:27:53	Was a fun show today. Rachel is so good at this.  
ZachLowe_NBA	720300932425056257	2016-04-13T17:21:39	Topic that may come up on TheJump today: if you think of one Kobe shot/moment, what it is? What's his version of MJ/Cavs, or MJ/'98 Finals?
ZachLowe_NBA	720298260334776320	2016-04-13T17:11:02	darvinpin No one disputes his production/numbers. If "group-think" you speak of is about his defense, well...that is just  true thing.
ZachLowe_NBA	720298062703276032	2016-04-13T17:10:15	DDollars2342 Ha, sorry!
ZachLowe_NBA	720297167471161344	2016-04-13T17:06:41	George Karl becomes like the third Kings coach who just play 4-on-5 defense in his final game, knowing he's out. Shoot 100 3s. Whatever.
ZachLowe_NBA	720289736657604609	2016-04-13T16:37:10	darvinpin I think making decisions on a single game on April 12th is probably very smart.
ZachLowe_NBA	720277756487950338	2016-04-13T15:49:33	Without deadlines, I might just give up on these things and start drinking copiously.  
ZachLowe_NBA	720271770981396480	2016-04-13T15:25:46	For sure. Crafting a message. But if the Raptors don't beat Indiana, it's the biggest disappointment yet.  
ZachLowe_NBA	720271275277594626	2016-04-13T15:23:48	I get what he's saying, but the Raptors should beat the Pacers. Indy has never found any consistency this season.  
ZachLowe_NBA	720246042185175040	2016-04-13T13:43:32	engnmart What award did I give him so far, again?
ZachLowe_NBA	720240797245804544	2016-04-13T13:22:42	teamziller Pflanns These are such hard choices.
ZachLowe_NBA	720239749659828224	2016-04-13T13:18:32	The great Pflanns + teamziller pick their awards. Interesting: no mention of Brow at all. Tide may be against him: 
ZachLowe_NBA	720078097421352960	2016-04-13T02:36:11	Polled a bunch of coaches and scouts before Clips-Grizz re: centers and guards for All-Defense. No consensus. All over the map.

ZachLowe_NBA	719919495725387776	2016-04-12T16:05:57	Some interesting choices from Tom here.  
ZachLowe_NBA	719918761193709568	2016-04-12T16:03:02	There is room for disagreement on Jamal Crawford and Russ Westbrook. We're splitting really, really thin hairs. Both were really good.
ZachLowe_NBA	719917720452603904	2016-04-12T15:58:54	greisas_ariel Yes, no respect, that's why I said what a great job he did in there. Even Stevens said Kerr-Pop should go 1-2.
ZachLowe_NBA	719917502957035520	2016-04-12T15:58:02	kenkenhall Just dropping profanity at a stranger, I guess. Cool, cool
ZachLowe_NBA	719917397260558337	2016-04-12T15:57:37	iyellyahtzee He was.
ZachLowe_NBA	719915076518551552	2016-04-12T15:48:24	Also, I think Mindy and davidstassen (w/ one assist from me) combined to break Geno's Lowe Post profanity record: 
ZachLowe_NBA	719914779851284480	2016-04-12T15:47:13	kenkenhall OK!
ZachLowe_NBA	719913535581642752	2016-04-12T15:42:16	TBrown2334 Don't think I said anything like that.
ZachLowe_NBA	719913224582205440	2016-04-12T15:41:02	Also, my fault, but if you need to avoid a "Mad Men" spoiler, skip the 5 minutes when Mindy talks about Leo DiCaprio's group of friends.
ZachLowe_NBA	719912684477673473	2016-04-12T15:38:53	Among topics we hit: Dartmouth, NBA crushes, fave "Office" eps, Dr. Katz, Laker games, Robert Parish, karaoke, dumb magazine article tropes.
ZachLowe_NBA	719912118527594496	2016-04-12T15:36:39	Lowe Post podcast: mindykaling and davidstassen on NBA randomness, comedy process, "The Mindy Project," much more:

ZachLowe_NBA	719911240949243904	2016-04-12T15:33:09	PrinceLifer I gave my reasoning. If you don't agree, that's fine. But I've done my work, and done my best.
ZachLowe_NBA	719907912907427840	2016-04-12T15:19:56	dixjeff Unfortunately, "since the All-Star" break encompasses about 25 games of an 82-game season.

ZachLowe_NBA	719905458262290432	2016-04-12T15:10:11	This is always a really hard exercise. Before you accuse me of not considering your guy, at least do a control-F. I did my best.

ZachLowe_NBA	719901632750862340	2016-04-12T14:54:59	Watching CHA-BOS from last night. Appeal of the BOS/ATL/MIA/CHA muddle is that w/ all 4 of them, when they look good, they look REALLY good.
ZachLowe_NBA	719728923379163137	2016-04-12T03:28:41	Dirk, Carlisle, Mavs, playoffs, every damn year, no matter what. What a crusher for Utah. Houston in prime position to back in vs tank-Kings

ZachLowe_NBA	719699744969342976	2016-04-12T01:32:45	Just recorded a live, all-over-the-place podcast w/ mindykaling and davidstassen: NBA randomness, comedy talk, more. Up tomorrow.
ZachLowe_NBA	719636035789934592	2016-04-11T21:19:35	FYI, league's official stance, I'm told, is that voters can list Draymond Green at center for All-NBA and other awards if they prefer.
ZachLowe_NBA	719629364439162880	2016-04-11T20:53:05	ZachLowe_NBA nerlens was 1.47 so technically below if you don't round which the search probably doesn't.
ZachLowe_NBA	719628903556325376	2016-04-11T20:51:15	Correction: Nerlens Noel also hitting the 1.5-1.5 double. Musta screwed up something in the search criteria.
ZachLowe_NBA	719628532201029632	2016-04-11T20:49:46	bdetrick hmm, not sure why his name didn't come up. Thought he might make the legendary 2-2 club this season
ZachLowe_NBA	719587464915132417	2016-04-11T18:06:35	RL__MARS He's a candidate. There are lots of candidates.

ZachLowe_NBA	719492317753839616	2016-04-11T11:48:30	mindykaling I get to ask the questions!
ZachLowe_NBA	719248778079944705	2016-04-10T19:40:46	haralabob Ha. I think of him more as a shark. And I've always wondered if he really believed it. NYK/Lowry talks indicate tank mindset, tho
ZachLowe_NBA	719247807203405824	2016-04-10T19:36:54	Tricky_Roma Really? Dig up his quotes.
ZachLowe_NBA	719247716707143682	2016-04-10T19:36:33	Lifeshtock Just read his quotes.
ZachLowe_NBA	719247397092794368	2016-04-10T19:35:17	haralabob JonathanTjarks He thought the move would make them worse, and has been pretty open about that.
ZachLowe_NBA	719247063746232324	2016-04-10T19:33:57	haralabob JonathanTjarks Also worth noting Masai thought trading Gay would help tank the team, and was 100% wrong.

ZachLowe_NBA	705746263787098112	2016-03-04T13:26:36	Amazing how GSW turned that game into a blowout. Did not like OKC's offense when KD sat. Strange OKC went from 2 backup PGs to 0.

ZachLowe_NBA	702887388884766721	2016-02-25T16:06:27	Would require shaking up a bench that has been dominant, but seems like there's a middle way of minutes distribution somewhere.
ZachLowe_NBA	702886966241525760	2016-02-25T16:04:46	One of the more interesting questions left in the season is if/when Toronto changes its starting lineup. Getting smoked every game.

ZachLowe_NBA	700370028458287104	2016-02-18T17:23:21	So DET gave its protected 1st for a guy who has barely played this year due to back injury, and not for Tobias Harris?

ZachLowe_NBA	699676446881640448	2016-02-16T19:27:18	Detroit sacrifices some cap space, but can look at Harris essentially as a free agency signing they lock in w/o bidding under higher cap.

ZachLowe_NBA	685854712961306626	2016-01-09T16:04:40	TheStudioKidA A truly wonderful joke.
