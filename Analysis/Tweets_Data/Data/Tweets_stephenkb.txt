stephenkb	711194554700046337	2016-03-19T14:16:09	tomcutterham I mean, actually think about it, not pause for 15 minutes and then return to it.
stephenkb	711194447799836672	2016-03-19T14:15:44	tomcutterham And I'll say again: you should think more self-critically about the assumption at the heart of your argument.
stephenkb	711194360646397953	2016-03-19T14:15:23	tomcutterham This is ridiculous. Like saying the word "rebrand" should be confined to the left.
stephenkb	711189646923796480	2016-03-19T13:56:39	tomcutterham Saying "there's nothing modern about austerity" is a category error.
stephenkb	711189453151334400	2016-03-19T13:55:53	tomcutterham No, you simply haven't got it. Not about austerity and privatisation. It is not an external term but a battle in a party.
stephenkb	711184409228083200	2016-03-19T13:35:50	Brutal but not unfair from stephenkb on IDS: 
stephenkb	711182074196201472	2016-03-19T13:26:34	tomcutterham The existence of a New Left didn't stymie the birth of the New Right.
stephenkb	711181735900405760	2016-03-19T13:25:13	tomcutterham It's not either/or. McDonnell is attempting to modernise from "left of Benn", but process is still modernisation.
stephenkb	711177484734210048	2016-03-19T13:08:20	tomcutterham But I simply don't buy that there are NS readers who see the phrase "Cameroon moderniser" &amp; do not see the same baggage I do.
stephenkb	711175822053343232	2016-03-19T13:01:43	tomcutterham It is an argument built around an imagined reader who you think less capable and informed than yourself.
stephenkb	711174322237390850	2016-03-19T12:55:46	tomcutterham Couple of problems here, not least that the word is not used "without caveat" in the piece.
stephenkb	711171844422950916	2016-03-19T12:45:55	Wonkypolicywonk Just read this. You have missed my point but understand it's a stressful time. Best wishes with it: 
stephenkb	711168276081078273	2016-03-19T12:31:44	Wonkypolicywonk Not a problem with comments - I just don't get why you are ignoring point of the article, which is not "DWP did nothing".
stephenkb	711167797007622144	2016-03-19T12:29:50	tomcutterham An argument that only appears in my mentions alongside a white male face. I wish you'd think critically about why that is.
stephenkb	711167566404780032	2016-03-19T12:28:55	tomcutterham And in this case, as so often, accompanied with the idea that I think "uncritically" about the Cameroon project. (3/?)
stephenkb	711166984461918209	2016-03-19T12:26:36	tomcutterham ...but other people see it and are gulled into thinking "they're lovely". (2/?)
stephenkb	711166493329891328	2016-03-19T12:24:39	tomcutterham ...superficial warm noises on climate change, development, rights agenda to remove "nasty party" problem...
stephenkb	711166319291453441	2016-03-19T12:23:58	tomcutterham Well, no, again, I don't accept your macro-argument, which is that you see moderniser and think... (1/?)

stephenkb	711163029103222784	2016-03-19T12:10:53	tomcutterham In the minds of whom? Not yours clearly. An imagined audience you think less intelligent than yourself, or the author's?
stephenkb	711161310214496257	2016-03-19T12:04:03	tomcutterham "Moderniser", as is clear from context, refers to internal Tory party balance. Do you think "old right" are literally old?
