zeynep	725770663777210368	2016-04-28T19:36:25	Matt_Cagle emptywheel Yep. It's where censorship that means something is, for now. In Turkey FB &amp; Twitter staying open is a plus, for now.
zeynep	725769739197362176	2016-04-28T19:32:44	Matt_Cagle emptywheel I see FB takedowns as having real effects, unlike government takedown requests which are .. meh. Not good but meh.
zeynep	725769540152508417	2016-04-28T19:31:57	Matt_Cagle emptywheel FB takes stuff down all the time including political content. Some defensible some not but always unaccountable.
zeynep	725769257276084224	2016-04-28T19:30:49	Matt_Cagle emptywheel I don't think there is global consensus to be ruled by US law only. I am worried about FB law aka TOS plus opacity.
zeynep	725769069069225986	2016-04-28T19:30:04	Matt_Cagle emptywheel And hate speech laws (in Europe) look odd to Americans but American IP law looks crazy to rest of world.
zeynep	725768900152053760	2016-04-28T19:29:24	Matt_Cagle emptywheel And "censored by govt request" rarely seems to be an impediment to diffusion. TOS account takedowns are real though.
zeynep	725768641040490497	2016-04-28T19:28:22	Matt_Cagle emptywheel My political sense (from Turkey) is that "we defy your laws, but obey US/EU laws" is not effective or sustainable.+
zeynep	725767567420346369	2016-04-28T19:24:06	Matt_Cagle emptywheel I share unease about intermediary censorship. But real issue is often TOS, IP etc. not government legal requests.
zeynep	725767228440907776	2016-04-28T19:22:46	Matt_Cagle emptywheel US intellectual property censorship (that's what it is) makes little sense, hard to defend. Should FB defy that law?
zeynep	725766892565180416	2016-04-28T19:21:25	Matt_Cagle emptywheel Do you think the world would be less censored if they defied laws, and got shut down? Including in the US?
zeynep	725765845255917568	2016-04-28T19:17:16	Matt_Cagle emptywheel It's demonization of medium, tight control of mass media, punishing a few high-profile dissidents etc. that works.
zeynep	725765621468782592	2016-04-28T19:16:22	Matt_Cagle emptywheel I don't support political censorship, obviously, but item take-downs have little to no effect. Accounts, some.
zeynep	725765378153046016	2016-04-28T19:15:24	Matt_Cagle emptywheel Hmm. "Given an inch they take a mile" doesn't really work online. That's not the government tactic most of the time.

zeynep	725326132166463488	2016-04-27T14:10:00	I can list many countries. People have reasons to be unsettled, and often lacking alternative politics, they turn to "iron fist" parties.

zeynep	725318095045312512	2016-04-27T13:38:04	One hopes what's happening across the world will spur strong, healthy movements and shifts among the elite. History says you need need both.
zeynep	725316076607791106	2016-04-27T13:30:03	Not a US anomaly. EU elections are being swept by "strongman" parties. Elsewhere too. That it's come to US shows how deep the problem is.

zeynep	725314406729584640	2016-04-27T13:23:24	Internet means that old methods of control via elite gatekeeping of public discourse won't work. I wrote about it:

zeynep	724978045518487552	2016-04-26T15:06:50	alexhanna alsothings ordinary people drop out; people who want to break windows attracted; informants break windows... Seen it bazillion X
zeynep	724977828853329921	2016-04-26T15:05:58	alexhanna alsothings Two people break one window; nobody can ID thus disown them; intense media focus; effective counter-propaganda..+
zeynep	724977583595642880	2016-04-26T15:05:00	alexhanna alsothings Protesters cannot police their own protest in masked environments. Almost always goes in one direction.
zeynep	724977469883842563	2016-04-26T15:04:32	alexhanna alsothings It comes sometimes from informants, sometimes police agents, sometimes few unhinged people.
zeynep	724977268737581056	2016-04-26T15:03:44	alexhanna alsothings the masks and high security environments and violence is a strong correlation historically. Not a coincidence.
zeynep	724977161396998144	2016-04-26T15:03:19	alexhanna alsothings In most any environment where you have masks, you steer into violence. Participants do, informants do, someone does.
zeynep	724977015535837184	2016-04-26T15:02:44	alexhanna alsothings Hence theory of protest. I guess I'm not saying you can't show up and get away with it. Sure.
zeynep	724976860304670721	2016-04-26T15:02:07	alexhanna alsothings Black bloc helped destroy the anti-corporate globalization movement. "Non-mask" type people stopped attending.
zeynep	724976707699093504	2016-04-26T15:01:31	alexhanna alsothings Tell me of historical protests with strong outcomes in environments that required high security or people wore masks.
zeynep	724976449405509634	2016-04-26T15:00:29	alexhanna alsothings You can do all that, but how you see effectiveness depends on your theory of how a protest works. Too hard in 140.
zeynep	724976186280005633	2016-04-26T14:59:26	alexhanna alsothings I guess I'll disagree. Basing this on my theory of protests, history of masked protests, and having seen many.
zeynep	724975924865847296	2016-04-26T14:58:24	alexhanna alsothings It absolutely changes who participates and how it feels like, though. Delegitimizes and marginalizes.
zeynep	724975756904939520	2016-04-26T14:57:44	alsothings alexhanna Protests are a demonstration of legitimacy &amp; strength—no other magic in them. Masks go against that in most contexts.
zeynep	724975295808299009	2016-04-26T14:55:54	alexhanna alsothings I think black bloc's history and role speaks to the point, as well as any place where stakes can be raised like this.
zeynep	724974647536660481	2016-04-26T14:53:20	alsothings alexhanna Protests aren't robberies, their power isn't from whether you can get away. In most contexts, masks defeat point.
zeynep	724974071088320512	2016-04-26T14:51:02	alsothings alexhanna Sure but that's a losing game. If only protesters are those willing to paint on eyes or black bloc, they already won.
zeynep	724972911879184384	2016-04-26T14:46:26	SteveBellovin alexhanna yeah.
zeynep	724972288412667905	2016-04-26T14:43:57	alexhanna It likely won't matter that much if it's right. It's a problem when it's right, it's a problem when it's a false positive.
zeynep	724970501349752832	2016-04-26T14:36:51	Oh, look, they are already here as mall cops. h/t kjhealy

zeynep	724969012652838912	2016-04-26T14:30:56	Oh, what could go wrong if the world goes down this path? (Not that I think this is one is that functional ... yet).

zeynep	724660525347553285	2016-04-25T18:05:07	csoghoian ncweaver Yes. I would have written "the implicit dangle" had it not been for 140. It's a permanent dangle that's just there.
zeynep	724656438501609472	2016-04-25T17:48:53	Besides, flooding elections with money isn't as powerful as people think. Influencing policy makers by dangling future jobs is more potent.
zeynep	724653521178615808	2016-04-25T17:37:17	jilliancyork ALangleyShields ..a lot of blanket rules are being enforced in really an uneven way. A lot of concentrated power here.

zeynep	724653122522587141	2016-04-25T17:35:42	A strong ban on revolving doors would probably help clean up politics more than focusing on big money. Eventually, people make policy.

zeynep	724638786391531520	2016-04-25T16:38:44	ALangleyShields jilliancyork I know about the German, Austrian laws. Even there, you can do research, publish in that context.

zeynep	722846007692627969	2016-04-20T17:54:52	It might be the same boat. Awful part is we don't even know how many have died. 500 here, 400 there. World shrugs. 
zeynep	722844976179118081	2016-04-20T17:50:46	Callous lack of management isn't stopping the wars that cause refugee waves; not helping the refugees; nor is it minimizing the backlash.
zeynep	722844645898604544	2016-04-20T17:49:28	The international community's response to the refugee tragedy is cruel, ineffective and is just making the consequences worse for all.
zeynep	722844120461365249	2016-04-20T17:47:22	Worst: The refugee tragedy—and the underlying horrible wars fuel it—are so huge that this cruel game of whack-a-mole won't make a dent.
zeynep	722843495749189633	2016-04-20T17:44:53	It's 2016 and about a 1,000 people have just died in two days in the Mediterranean trying to flee wars &amp; unbearable conditions. Barely news.
zeynep	722843128995024896	2016-04-20T17:43:26	We celebrate heroes who save people fleeing war—long after they're dead. Now, we're acting like the villains in those heroism movies.
zeynep	722842234509393921	2016-04-20T17:39:53	Letting millions pile up in poor, mostly small neighboring countries is not a tenable solution. Neither is treating this like whack-a-mole.
zeynep	722841988068806657	2016-04-20T17:38:54	Millions of people fleeing horrific wars, mostly in four or five countries. Huge tragedy and a colossal mistake not to manage this well.

zeynep	722452698122035200	2016-04-19T15:52:00	mikehorton No, but it may force the airlines to find an expedient solution rather than dumping the whole cost on the victim and moving on.
zeynep	722443575854829569	2016-04-19T15:15:45	GrantGambling BlairReeves It would be wrong, but it would show the role of airline crew in deciding, rather than merely responding.
zeynep	722443190989680640	2016-04-19T15:14:13	.academicdave We want people to report. Shoe bomber idiot was flagged by passengers. But this empowers the paranoid, all costs to victim.
zeynep	722442477563691008	2016-04-19T15:11:23	.ClaytonNicholas SouthwestAir I get why airlines are compelled to investigate even when baseless. But price shouldn't be paid by victim.
zeynep	722442207203090432	2016-04-19T15:10:19	BlairReeves Really want to do an audit study where people finger random white people and see if they are thrown off the plane. :-(
zeynep	722441545492905984	2016-04-19T15:07:41	If baseless and paranoid suspicions of random passengers started delaying planes and everyone in them, we'd soon have a higher bar.
zeynep	722441278336708608	2016-04-19T15:06:37	Instead, SouthwestAir plane—and all passengers—should get stuck while authorities investigate and then person should be let back on plane.
zeynep	722440804044824576	2016-04-19T15:04:44	At the moment: Random passenger: "Man flying while brown is a threat."  SouthwestAir "Okay, we will make him suffer even if it's baseless."
zeynep	722440330105262080	2016-04-19T15:02:51	If a person is "suspected" then plane should wait till issue cleared. If this hurts *everyone*, things will change.

zeynep	722066168090140672	2016-04-18T14:16:04	So I wouldn't be surprised if there was another wave of movements that combined this experience with new energy and deep use of tech. /end

zeynep	722064723408265220	2016-04-18T14:10:20	Here—as in other places in the world—new tech allows movements to grow without a strategic plan for engagement with the system as it exists.
zeynep	722064391336763392	2016-04-18T14:09:00	As jbouie says, there has always been this wing in the US. Difference is now you can get far in the campaign without other infrastructure.+

zeynep	721019909791203328	2016-04-15T16:58:37	covrter So Twitter makes it hard to refine the permissions? I reject DM access on principle, and rest is fine with me but is security hole.

zeynep	718064767584309249	2016-04-07T13:15:56	Roddy_Campbell Noahpinion It'll backfire politically and misses the 99% of the improvement that can be done to trade policies &amp; help more.
zeynep	718064569529315328	2016-04-07T13:15:09	Roddy_Campbell Noahpinion "Neoliberal trade helped the world's poor from horrific baseline" is not a great argument. I explained why.

zeynep	718058835278237700	2016-04-07T12:52:21	Finally, trade as it is practiced is one part of multiple, multi-decade forces weakening employer/worker leverage vis-a-vis corporations.
zeynep	718058443857334272	2016-04-07T12:50:48	It's 2016. We should be able to discuss the politics of global trade without mercantilist strawmen on the table, no? Noahpinion
zeynep	718058062284791809	2016-04-07T12:49:17	Anyone arguing trade is awesome as is as it helped world's poor—much less than it could—needs to outsource own job first to show sincerity.
zeynep	718057329481162752	2016-04-07T12:46:22	There is an enormous amount of improvement possible to global trade policies if we can just accept a teeny bit less corporate profit.
zeynep	718056976094244864	2016-04-07T12:44:58	(Economists can't argue corporations won't do trade for less profit. Yes they would, and, hey, marginal utility idea says they would)
zeynep	718056713719513088	2016-04-07T12:43:56	A reasonable trade policy that truly lifted more boats in poor countries &amp; cushioned first-world workers would still make lot of profit.
zeynep	718056478276460544	2016-04-07T12:42:59	I'm guessing Noahpinion wouldn't voluntarily vote to turn over his job to 10 Indian economists at $10K a piece? Can't have such politics.

zeynep	718055871645892608	2016-04-07T12:40:35	Of course trade is beneficial in many ways. The issue is straightforward: most of its benefits have been accruing to large corporations.

zeynep	715543119756795904	2016-03-31T14:15:48	thegrugq GonzoHacker Wow. Though not surprised. What a world.
zeynep	715537636912398337	2016-03-31T13:54:01	This is not a US-only process. Gatekeepers everywhere are growing weaker. Increased direct repression is a sign and a response to this.

zeynep	715536743282384896	2016-03-31T13:50:28	I argue that Trump's rise is more a symptom mass media's weakness in patrolling limits of discourse than its power.

zeynep	714996256863428608	2016-03-30T02:02:46	That is a winning position among a substantial section of the GOP base. This is a base/elite split in Trump's favor.

zeynep	714805742507663360	2016-03-29T13:25:44	emptywheel Yeah. Though the problem is pool isn't small. It's really not like US. There *is* a pool there. Long story why but here we are.

zeynep	714803995936591872	2016-03-29T13:18:47	Another detail: ISIS recruits in Europe are given "complete tactical autonomy". So you gotta identify them, since they are not calling home.
zeynep	714803031745888257	2016-03-29T13:14:57	TrueCrypt is not for communication, so something else? Article also says the guy used Facebook chat, so there's that.
zeynep	714802612953079809	2016-03-29T13:13:17	So ISIS used TrueCrypt. (With password on a paper in Mom's house🙄). But article doesn't say which messaging tool.

zeynep	712736879133777920	2016-03-23T20:24:48	obotheclown It is more relevant. It's the darn profile. Second gen, been to prison or been to Syria. But I guess we leave it here.

zeynep	712735211008688128	2016-03-23T20:18:10	obotheclown Because that's THE PROFILE, not refugees. Poland is refusing refugees. Not sure how many more times I can say this.

zeynep	712732433267957760	2016-03-23T20:07:08	obotheclown As for now, colonial history is obviously part of this, but so are many many things, most of it in the past 20 years.
zeynep	712732198999310336	2016-03-23T20:06:12	obotheclown Poland shuts borders to refugees. I reminded that the attackers are European, with parents from colonies. Not refugees.

zeynep	712725336807440388	2016-03-23T19:38:56	obotheclown What do the refugees have to with it? Why are we punishing the most desperate victims? That's what I responded to.
zeynep	712725052681113600	2016-03-23T19:37:49	obotheclown The common attacker profile is second gen European, parents from from colonies. It's not an excuse, it's the profile.
zeynep	712723569763946497	2016-03-23T19:31:55	obotheclown Neither are the refugees. They're fleeing bombs. ISIS kills more Muslims than any other group. No doubt they are a threat.
zeynep	712722526372241408	2016-03-23T19:27:46	obotheclown Many of the attackers had nothing to with migration or seeking refuge. Part of another history we pretend doesn't exist.

zeynep	712719179040817156	2016-03-23T19:14:28	obotheclown The profiles of these people is one thing. (Mostly second gen/loser/petty criminal with Syria or prison pipeline to terrorism).
zeynep	712717606000701440	2016-03-23T19:08:13	zeynep there's another bit of relevant European history.  Terrorism in the seventies.  It felt unstoppable until it stopped.

zeynep	712666458711527424	2016-03-23T15:44:59	evanchill tomgara That may well be, but the fact that his point was correct is important.
zeynep	712665318104109056	2016-03-23T15:40:27	tomgara evanchill I think the objection to that "document" as any evidence of anything is correct.

zeynep	712664740326191105	2016-03-23T15:38:09	tomgara evanchill The issue isn't "Is ISIS using encryption". I'd say very likely. But a gibberish document isn't the proof.
zeynep	712664455407149056	2016-03-23T15:37:01	tomgara evanchill *That* makes perfect sense. (Though it's not in the excellent NYT piece? It should be). That doc in thread? Gibberish.

zeynep	712245626529062912	2016-03-22T11:52:44	Yes, the goal of terrorism is to create fear, panic and overreaction. The antidote is information, straight-talk and long-term prevention.

zeynep	712244085780844544	2016-03-22T11:46:37	This makes me sad. In Turkey, social media gets throttled after attacks just as people are desperate for news. :-(

zeynep	711954952084725760	2016-03-21T16:37:42	thegrugq As with most terrorism worth worrying about, this is mostly going to depend on how deep the pool, and how alienated/angry.

zeynep	711954530510962693	2016-03-21T16:36:02	thegrugq I certainly hope you are right. The lack of sophistication so far has been striking, and very lucky for us. Another issue is +
zeynep	711953700567257088	2016-03-21T16:32:44	thegrugq I agree. Why I focus on the sophistication displayed. If there exists: sophistication and numbers; there will exist: workaround.
zeynep	711953102287540224	2016-03-21T16:30:21	thegrugq SteveBellovin How long before they realize they can purposefully open that loop? Wrong numbers, etc?
zeynep	711952942274846720	2016-03-21T16:29:43	thegrugq SteveBellovin ..and if they gain some rudimentary opsec, and then go to Syria and get weapons training and learn to be calm.
zeynep	711952798057951233	2016-03-21T16:29:09	thegrugq SteveBellovin That's why the citizenship crisis is so potent. If there are clusters of existing strong-tie networks...
zeynep	711952585717129216	2016-03-21T16:28:18	thegrugq SteveBellovin Yeah, I'm guessing focusing on burners is the first obvious step we'll see. But you'd need to turn off roaming too.
zeynep	711952375720894464	2016-03-21T16:27:28	thegrugq SteveBellovin Well, so, that's what Turkey does (as does many European countries). Only an obstacle, not an absolute wall.

zeynep	711945976630611969	2016-03-21T16:02:02	thegrugq SteveBellovin But how long before terrorists realize then can open closed loops on purpose? Comes down to sophistication again.
zeynep	711945872150556673	2016-03-21T16:01:37	thegrugq SteveBellovin Agencies will be even more reluctant to give up bulk, if burners available. They'd give up encryption before bulk.
zeynep	711945674473021440	2016-03-21T16:00:50	thegrugq SteveBellovin If you can discard burners fast enough, encryption *almost* irrelevant. Once again, sophistication will matter.
zeynep	711945418528133120	2016-03-21T15:59:49	thegrugq SteveBellovin You know they sift through bulk metadata for closed loops to identify burner to burner suspects? Many implications.
zeynep	711945005032726529	2016-03-21T15:58:11	It's almost like this: if you have true burner phones easily available—and sophisticated terrorists—encryption is almost irrelevant. Almost.
zeynep	711944753470906368	2016-03-21T15:57:11	Also note intelligence agencies are using "burner-to-burner" closed loops to identify suspects. But won't work if burners discarded fast.
zeynep	711942980739964929	2016-03-21T15:50:08	.sladner Yes, also! Many platforms don't really understand their users or uses. To be honest, Facebook most improved in this regard lately.
zeynep	711942077773422592	2016-03-21T15:46:33	Also, better search? Spelling correction? Search within a list? Search people who follow me? Easier creation and sharing of lists? etc.
zeynep	711941664357613568	2016-03-21T15:44:54	SteveBellovin Search for something. Click on "more options." Some useful options. 
zeynep	711941447277268994	2016-03-21T15:44:02	SteveBellovin This is available on Twitter native. (Gave up on Tweetdeck after Twitter started neglecting it. Another rant).
zeynep	711941047375564801	2016-03-21T15:42:27	SteveBellovin You can search "from people I follow"--which is terribly useful and I use it all the time. But kinda hidden function.
zeynep	711940634274353154	2016-03-21T15:40:49	My positive wish for a Twitter I'd love more: more support for its core function: conversation. Lists, co-discovery and more is neglected.
zeynep	711922875163418625	2016-03-21T14:30:14	This is important, folks. This is a more potent method. This also shows exclusive focus on encryption was misguided.

zeynep	709367710900219904	2016-03-14T13:16:56	I mean George Wallace in past? And  wave of racism against the first black president? Remember, Trump embraced by Romney while a "birther".

zeynep	709366464634036224	2016-03-14T13:11:59	I agree except I think "nobody represents us" is also huge part of it. There was research research showing this to be true among Trump fans.

zeynep	709364926930939904	2016-03-14T13:05:52	When you have a nominal democracy that is in fact captured by the powerful *and* significant social change.. You get these complex effects.
zeynep	709364323634847745	2016-03-14T13:03:28	Academic research bears this out: legislators respond to donors and wealthy constituents. (So mundane that you don't need research to know).
zeynep	709364144437338113	2016-03-14T13:02:46	The number of protests globally since 2006 are triple the 10 years before. You constantly hear: "nobody represents us." Everywhere.

zeynep	708640633670516736	2016-03-12T13:07:47	Few protesters one-by-one: works for Trump. Large group: different. New phase. Will happen again. KC tonight. 
zeynep	708511326956621824	2016-03-12T04:33:58	Few protesters being kicked out surrounded by his adoring fans he can handle. But sustained booing from a hostile crowd dents "winner" aura.

zeynep	708306123141586945	2016-03-11T14:58:34	KatzOnEarth Have no idea! I'll use different word since it seems to imply joviality? Not my intent at all.

zeynep	708305365839048704	2016-03-11T14:55:33	KatzOnEarth Performance? Theatrics? I don't use it to make light of it; but to highlight its repetitive, central role in his crowd methods.
zeynep	708304405297287168	2016-03-11T14:51:44	Also: it's true for protests and rallies. On-the-ground is a different—usually more limited view—than what you piece together next morning.

zeynep	708303173979652096	2016-03-11T14:46:50	KatzOnEarth The tactic:  Provoking confrontation with protesters as a means to energize rally/movement.
zeynep	708302840201093121	2016-03-11T14:45:31	KatzOnEarth I wouldn't call it a joke, but it was certainly a show. (I'm quoting Nazi use of the method so obviously not finding it funny).
zeynep	708302707891769344	2016-03-11T14:44:59	laurenbraden It's an old tactic; he probably realized that such tensions energized the rally? No need to study, really.
zeynep	708302440903401472	2016-03-11T14:43:56	GerardHarbison KatzOnEarth That's my point; there is no accident, it's part of this performance, edging on the protester/crowd dynamic.
zeynep	708302313774047232	2016-03-11T14:43:25	KatzOnEarth He was calm, never missed a beat. He turned, waited, joked. I think he knew what he was doing. To me, he seemed to relish it.
zeynep	708301821043941376	2016-03-11T14:41:28	KatzOnEarth Do you disagree with that part, or how I use the word shtick? (Which I may be misusing?).
zeynep	708301686079627265	2016-03-11T14:40:56	KatzOnEarth What I mean by shtick:"he knew it was coming, he was ready for it, he was well-practiced, he performed exactly as he intended."
zeynep	708301051137499136	2016-03-11T14:38:24	So, he can't &amp; won't bring the protester/crowd tensions down. If it came down, he'd probably go try to provoke it up, or, heck, hire people.
zeynep	708300677903224832	2016-03-11T14:36:55	Trump is a great stage-manager, connects to crowd. He wants &amp; needs the protesters/"his people" tension. He waits for it. He pivots from it.
zeynep	708299997964582913	2016-03-11T14:34:13	The confrontations and the "I don't condone punches but my very good, the best people are angry" is not incidental—it's central to the show.
zeynep	708299618849853440	2016-03-11T14:32:43	I watched his rally. The whole performance depends upon being interrupted by protests every 2-3 minutes, and the resulting energy/tension.
zeynep	708299244793372672	2016-03-11T14:31:14	You know who else provoked brawls with protesters to energize his rallies? No I'm serious. It's an old tactic. 
zeynep	708139360672215041	2016-03-11T03:55:54	Trump says 51% of the delegates was a "random number someone picked" Well, 1237 *is* a prime number. See, it all makes sense now. *lalala*

zeynep	708134335736631296	2016-03-11T03:35:56	I was at rally protester got punched. It wasn't visible to the crowd. Trump did say: "If a protester punches, I hope we could punch back".

zeynep	707985830229499904	2016-03-10T17:45:50	LindiEmoungu Lep. They feel "indignant" at interruptions, entertained by the theater. But also: "look, we are so many yet they walk out."
zeynep	707985595646283776	2016-03-10T17:44:54	LindiEmoungu Thank you! His crowd would deport me because of country of origin—I guess—but I believe in deciphering rather than projecting.
zeynep	707985308709687296	2016-03-10T17:43:45	LindiEmoungu So, if they learn protester punched? Meh—they approve or don't care too much. But also angry that it gets a lot of media play.
zeynep	707985139385638912	2016-03-10T17:43:05	LindiEmoungu His supporters complained that media only reports "tiny, isolated" incidents, not their candidate's message. +
zeynep	707984940097540096	2016-03-10T17:42:18	LindiEmoungu (Of course, normalizing violence creates feedback; these things can't just be squeezed back into the toothpaste tube, scary).
zeynep	707984784992108544	2016-03-10T17:41:41	LindiEmoungu I think open, persistent violence would scare some portion, but might draw some more. Not uniform. My sense from one night.
zeynep	707984564623433730	2016-03-10T17:40:48	LindiEmoungu No doubt some would welcome the violence but there was a "high horse" feel in the crowd. We're trying to talk, they interrupt.
zeynep	707984179183665152	2016-03-10T17:39:16	LindiEmoungu He ..rambles a lot, but it's like he almost waits for a protest. He stops, comments, roars, laughs and goes on. Cheered on.
zeynep	707983967832641536	2016-03-10T17:38:26	LindiEmoungu Both. The punching was not noticed in the room. But there were 16+ protests, used by Trump as theater, energized the crowd.

zeynep	707981488738967553	2016-03-10T17:28:35	"To understand" doesn't necessarily mean to sympathize. It also means, "to decipher how something works." I'm unapologetic about that.

zeynep	707979572034342912	2016-03-10T17:20:58	How "on the ground" diverges from later media story: I had no idea of the punching incident despite line of sight. 
zeynep	707960199819206657	2016-03-10T16:03:59	nathanjurgenson There are different uses of it. And I wasn't just talking about Twitter. The whole thing is one-to-many organized.
zeynep	707959659727097856	2016-03-10T16:01:50	Rally yesterday also helped me conclude that while Trump uses Twitter to "hack" mass media attention, he is very much a broadcast candidate.
zeynep	707959203814625284	2016-03-10T16:00:02	Also: Trump never says "Marco" without "little" and "Ted" without "lying." (LY-EN). What's their shorthand for what's wrong with Trump?

zeynep	707944928786124800	2016-03-10T15:03:18	So, if you are wondering what Trump supporters think about the punching? They don't see it because it's a short event that you don't notice.
zeynep	707944496441516032	2016-03-10T15:01:35	To Trump supporters in the room: an energized rally, many lighthearted moments. Next day media: protester punched. There: you don't see it.
zeynep	707944052503797761	2016-03-10T14:59:49	The way an event feels on the ground, and the way media—including new media— depict an event can diverge a lot. Trump rallies: absolutely.
zeynep	707942009990991872	2016-03-10T14:51:42	My observation: Trump has lines: "Who's going to pay for the Wall?", some politics, some ramblings &amp; protests to carry through his rallies.
zeynep	707941313874939904	2016-03-10T14:48:56	Roger_Davis2 Yeah, same, I'm just putting out what I saw.
zeynep	707941236313821184	2016-03-10T14:48:38	I believe protesters can (and often do) think tactically.I'm putting out my observations. RT Roger_Davis2 does this justify not protesting?
zeynep	707940821132320768	2016-03-10T14:46:59	He jokes about the protesters, "Look, another one, nice shirt", roars: "get her out." Police do, the crowd goes wild. Total shtick by now.
zeynep	707940497151692800	2016-03-10T14:45:42	He said the cameras otherwise focus on his face, and protesters make the cameras "turn like pretzels" to show the crowd to the folks home.
zeynep	707940151092256768	2016-03-10T14:44:19	Trump jokes about them: how they make the media cameras turn to show the large crowd. "I love the protesters" he said, many times.
zeynep	707940047589396480	2016-03-10T14:43:54	Note again we had no idea anyone had been punched. For the observer anywhere outside few seats, it's commotion, Trump comment, slogans, out.
zeynep	707939850951983104	2016-03-10T14:43:08	I counted 16 or 17 protester interruption. Sad to say: They've become part of his schtick. They make his rallies work &amp; become energized.
zeynep	707939479709990912	2016-03-10T14:41:39	I didn't know until this morning that someone had been punched, for example. You hear a commotion, that's it. Only immediate vicinity knows.
zeynep	707939273010446336	2016-03-10T14:40:50	I was at this rally as an observer. Not even from this, but it doesn't play in the room the way it looks on media.

zeynep	707773891003940864	2016-03-10T03:43:40	The tl;dr is this: Trump is a much much better politician than he comes off on TV. Also, wow, no organizational chops. Both were striking.

zeynep	706844765946572802	2016-03-07T14:11:39	But just like "The Party Decides" was an era *in response* freeing of primaries, the elites will respond to this challenge. They always do.
zeynep	706844569141387264	2016-03-07T14:10:52	Soo, whatever else happens. You can bet that the next time around, there will be more attempts. On both sides. The path is obvious now.

zeynep	706843564316217344	2016-03-07T14:06:52	The need people felt to do this wouldn't be so high if the elite failure in governance had not reached such a (miserable) peak.
zeynep	706843411513536512	2016-03-07T14:06:16	The "invisible primary"--the elites putting money &amp; media behind a candidate before the first primary vote--can obviously be upended now.
zeynep	706843236434890752	2016-03-07T14:05:34	"The Party Decides" wasn't wrong: it described an era. Eras end, as things build up and new tools, and organizational methods spring up.
zeynep	706842958604144640	2016-03-07T14:04:28	Whatever else happens, one thing is clear: "The Party" can no longer hold back the strategic weakness of primaries to the "establishment."

zeynep	704684938411556864	2016-03-01T15:09:16	SeanTrende Add all the race issues that really bubbled after Obama election. Trump coalition is .. almost mundane. Except Trump isn't.
zeynep	704684722312630272	2016-03-01T15:08:24	SeanTrende Tax-cut/trickle down/~trade/war abroad had not served base. Took very long to finally surface, actually. "The Party" held back.
zeynep	704683775213637633	2016-03-01T15:04:39	SeanTrende Tea Party base wasn't concerned Party "not conservative enough" by elite definition but something else: 
zeynep	704683521286217728	2016-03-01T15:03:38	SeanTrende Hmm. I think the R coalition had long fractured, and the Tea Party wasn't what the "Party" projected onto it.
zeynep	704676031538601984	2016-03-01T14:33:52	Also, "The Party" may yet somehow carry Rubio over the finishing line, but after all this, I don't see how the fracture goes away quietly.
zeynep	704675265205682176	2016-03-01T14:30:50	emilydshaw cshirky Yep. Global phenom.
zeynep	704675014004629506	2016-03-01T14:29:50	Also the R primary calendar is front-loaded &amp; greased for the front-runner (assumed to be who "The Party" decided.) But, this year, oops.
zeynep	704674461073731584	2016-03-01T14:27:38	SeanTrende ? I don't think party policies were generally representing voter concerns, probably more severe on the R side.
zeynep	704673964497444864	2016-03-01T14:25:40	.@DrT_Sociology But that's also because of crisis of representation and "The Party Decides." Turnout spikes if opportunity shows up.

zeynep	701793446785376256	2016-02-22T15:39:31	Chanders Guess I'd say that the argument from tech isn't all bluster and PR. Stuff isn't infinitely malleable, tech specifics matter.

zeynep	701785898233544704	2016-02-22T15:09:31	Chanders Finally, as I read details, I'm now convinced government picked case for PR value, not investigatory need. Makes it worse.

zeynep	701771855229755392	2016-02-22T14:13:43	Historical, transformative nature of encryption isn't that it keeps things private—like a safe—but that it's mundane to everything online.
zeynep	701771637377654786	2016-02-22T14:12:51	Interesting physical analogy but difference is scale. Scale changes stakes. No encryption=can't function online.

zeynep	701451410651672576	2016-02-21T17:00:23	SeanOQuin Yeah, numbers are clear. Unsecured guns cause many accidents of the most tragic kind, and facilitate successful youth suicides.
zeynep	701447767835680770	2016-02-21T16:45:54	SeanOQuin Also, for these deranged killers, there's the infamy angle. Sensationalized coverage breeds copycats. 
zeynep	701447576927793153	2016-02-21T16:45:09	GSlutkin I don't disagree. 
zeynep	701447396107141120	2016-02-21T16:44:26	SeanOQuin I know larger issue hard to budge but at a bare minimum, I'd want very strict lock &amp; put away rules, esp. homes with kids/teens.
zeynep	701446793956032516	2016-02-21T16:42:02	SeanOQuin But as you note, this is more about the psychology. Data also suggests a small minority is buying a lot of guns.. as you observe.
zeynep	701446647214161921	2016-02-21T16:41:27	SeanOQuin Not at work but I can look at it on Monday. Guns at home facilitate more accidental or suicide deaths than prevent intrusion.

zeynep	701430604345253888	2016-02-21T15:37:42	SeanOQuin And then the arms race aspect: the more guns around, the more people think they need one for protection. So it goes...
zeynep	701429800381059073	2016-02-21T15:34:31	SeanOQuin But then there's the political psyche of this country, the gun lobby and a lot of people who think "for me, that's not the case."
zeynep	701429506310086656	2016-02-21T15:33:20	SeanOQuin I tend to think statistically about such questions. The numbers are pretty clear, more guns around more senseless, tragic deaths.
zeynep	701427559238606849	2016-02-21T15:25:36	SeanOQuin Hard truth is that it's really hard to stop or prevent deranged armed people. Fortunately, it's very rare. Still horrible.
zeynep	701426493214367745	2016-02-21T15:21:22	SeanOQuin Statistically,  more guns around the more people killed. Even highly trained people kill bystanders in such situations.

zeynep	701416902221033472	2016-02-21T14:43:15	I don't mean to say there's no such thing as political terrorism. These categories bleed into each other.

zeynep	700407888410447877	2016-02-18T19:53:48	ncweaver schlockdaddy I think the propaganda value is key, though. "We'd catch terrorists if only it wasn't for Apple/Google etc."
zeynep	700407707078103040	2016-02-18T19:53:04	emilesnyder That helps, but brute force is an arms race that moves fast.
zeynep	700406825817137152	2016-02-18T19:49:34	emilesnyder Sure, but the FBI wants to use firmware update to circumvent whatever you do. So defense would be moving to hardware.
zeynep	700406658728648704	2016-02-18T19:48:55	emilesnyder Fascinating part: there is no blanket argument for always denying all governments all access. But this case isn't about access.
zeynep	700406433205108737	2016-02-18T19:48:01	emilesnyder I don't know: 8 digits/chars that hard to use? Also, most people's threat model isn't the FBI/NSA (why should it be?)
zeynep	700405606201618432	2016-02-18T19:44:44	ncweaver Problem is more radicalization of deranged/criminal/lost via open media than conspiracy to commit terrorism via encrypted channel.
zeynep	700405004927115264	2016-02-18T19:42:20	ncweaver Guess it's the first case they can label terrorism; that it is investigatorily weak is fascinating and revealing, no?
zeynep	700401438887911428	2016-02-18T19:28:10	The FBI is unlikely to find much in the messages of two deranged "American-style" workplace shooters. But access to tech updates... Wow.
zeynep	700400869049819136	2016-02-18T19:25:54	Look, Apple vs FBI is about using updates to undermine protections. ncweaver:  &amp; csoghoian: 
zeynep	700399701787598848	2016-02-18T19:21:16	ncweaver Yep. Messing with the update mechanism=messing with vaccines. csoghoian made this point in PDF: 
zeynep	700398937556021249	2016-02-18T19:18:14	SLevelt link?
zeynep	700398843259699200	2016-02-18T19:17:51	Bill_Owen The method demanded in this case makes this different.
zeynep	700398187299893248	2016-02-18T19:15:15	So pretty obvious the stakes are more the precedent than the access itself. And the path, a firmware update, is so fraught with issues.
zeynep	700397754686820354	2016-02-18T19:13:32	On the case, the optics look good for FBI ("known killers! let us in!") but the stakes for them are low. Killers dead, seem deranged &amp; lone.
zeynep	700397191496654849	2016-02-18T19:11:17	Is everyone else just as fascinated by Apple vs FBI? Especially since it's not true this would apply only to 5/5c.

zeynep	696004494040162306	2016-02-06T16:16:17	nathanjurgenson Absolutely do. I also use lists. I also (as part of research) go look at conversations in many places.

zeynep	696001792874844168	2016-02-06T16:05:33	nathanjurgenson I disagree. I would hide metrics myself but nothing is like Twitter for public, real-time conversation.

zeynep	695998174629068801	2016-02-06T15:51:10	There is a lot of things algorithms could help with. The problem is core product is neglected. FB never does that. 
zeynep	695997911436496896	2016-02-06T15:50:07	nathanjurgenson I disagree. Enormous amount of conversation, and RT's bring on more conversation. Never seen it go down.

zeynep	695996008505991169	2016-02-06T15:42:34	If Twitter becomes a place that values "engagement" defined as viewership over conversation, how can it compete with Facebook? FB is better.
zeynep	695995704586665984	2016-02-06T15:41:21	Why this instead of fixing basics, focusing on conversation tools, empowering users: lists; better tools for mute/block; better threading?
zeynep	695995282589421568	2016-02-06T15:39:40	Whatever plays well to the algorithm will go further since more will see it.  There is no getting around this feedback loop.
zeynep	695994743453577216	2016-02-06T15:37:32	Look, I liked &amp; used the algorithmic discovery tab. Problems with algorithm as default feed (opt-in or out) is it'll change the ecosystem.

zeynep	695804045039116288	2016-02-06T02:59:46	Breaking user experience into segments will make problems multiply and kill core. FIX basic issues, ADD features.
zeynep	695803480334843905	2016-02-06T02:57:31	Then add a tab, like discovery. ADD. If half is algorithmic, half chronological, it won't work the same. ADD A TAB. 
zeynep	695802226988732416	2016-02-06T02:52:32	How about fix the most basic stuff. Like thread this quoted tweet where it should go? Improve lists? On boarding? 
zeynep	695802017927852032	2016-02-06T02:51:43	Like my Facebook page please! Really! 😀😀 If dealing with an algorithm anyway, I'll invest time in bigger platform. 
zeynep	695800557903155200	2016-02-06T02:45:55	Twitter product: stagnant; bugs unsolved; innovation meager.Yet here we are, by the millions. Algorithmic default feed will kill our reason.
zeynep	695800022412165120	2016-02-06T02:43:47	Twitter can ADD  algorithmic "discovery" tab, support conversation, onboarding, lists, user tools. Instead: kill what keeps us coming back?
zeynep	695799573671972864	2016-02-06T02:42:00	Twitter's core, it's beating heart, is conversation, it's human filters, and real-time interaction. Algorithm kills all that.
zeynep	695799249758461952	2016-02-06T02:40:43	And your power users? They'll go to Facebook. Facebook has a huge upside. If we're fighting algorithms, might as well go there.
zeynep	695799003557060608	2016-02-06T02:39:44	If Twitter makes algorithmic filter default and allow opt-out, it still won't be Twitter. Most will see a few things in a feedback loop. ugh
zeynep	695797966616051712	2016-02-06T02:35:37	What? No no no. This won't make it Facebook. It'll lose Twitterness without becoming FB. What a shortsighted move.

zeynep	695684900696023041	2016-02-05T19:06:20	jessecshore GabrielRossman NAChristakis barrywellman Also. FB changed a lot for many; I see it in literature, my research &amp; own life.
zeynep	695682240756342784	2016-02-05T18:55:46	jessecshore GabrielRossman NAChristakis barrywellman That is exactly my point.
zeynep	695682105158668288	2016-02-05T18:55:13	GabrielRossman NAChristakis barrywellman Yea. 20th century was weird. High mobility, low connectivity. Now high-high. Before low-low.
zeynep	695681575447502848	2016-02-05T18:53:07	jessecshore GabrielRossman NAChristakis barrywellman So they are not fully interchangeable.

zeynep	695680985325645824	2016-02-05T18:50:46	GabrielRossman NAChristakis barrywellman I'm in close contact with almost my entire small high school class. Real friends. No FB no way.
zeynep	695680759923765248	2016-02-05T18:49:52	GabrielRossman NAChristakis barrywellman Not sure by how much but it would reduce, and ~1 is a big reduction.
zeynep	695679972891979776	2016-02-05T18:46:45	GabrielRossman NAChristakis barrywellman Also, larger weak tie pool may mean more robust strong tie networks. More to choose/replace.

zeynep	695678981710807041	2016-02-05T18:42:48	duncanjwatts NAChristakis barrywellman See thread. The argument has been this no is stable, FB doesn't alter "reality".  Don't see why.
zeynep	695678467568857088	2016-02-05T18:40:46	GabrielRossman NAChristakis barrywellman +And weak ties are integral to Milgram. Also why would a 1953 measure be so stable?
zeynep	695678013745180672	2016-02-05T18:38:58	GabrielRossman NAChristakis barrywellman Even if we assume stable strong primary network size, meaningful weak tie networks are larger.+
zeynep	695677774611099648	2016-02-05T18:38:01	GabrielRossman NAChristakis barrywellman FB allows continuing ties that would be lost in 20th century—we moved but had less connectivity.

zeynep	695618097646972928	2016-02-05T14:40:53	duncanjwatts NAChristakis barrywellman Have not read their full paper (not sure if it is out). I buy that "6" can and will change.
zeynep	695617812677562369	2016-02-05T14:39:45	AmarDhand NAChristakis But I repeat my question: if you think 6 is stable &amp; immutable, since when? Modernity? Bronze Age? Since 1953?
zeynep	695617403657400324	2016-02-05T14:38:07	AmarDhand NAChristakis Connectivity—telephone, Facebook, railroads, etc—change where your nodes are. Obviously that changes.

zeynep	695610567315189761	2016-02-05T14:10:57	AmarDhand NAChristakis Unless the argument is that "6" represents an immutable number since the Pleistocene, why can't it change? It can.
zeynep	695610251366633473	2016-02-05T14:09:42	AmarDhand NAChristakis Cognitive constraints on feelings of being close are a different question. Again, "6" wasn't the number in 1643.
zeynep	695593487866068992	2016-02-05T13:03:05	NAChristakis I don't see why they would no count in a six degree experiment. They are my friends because we've been able to stay in touch.

zeynep	695592738150969345	2016-02-05T13:00:06	NAChristakis Presumably, the number wasn't 6 before invention of the steam ship &amp; railroad? So it changed over time. I can change again.
zeynep	695592376958525440	2016-02-05T12:58:40	NAChristakis I accept role of evolutionary heritage but don't see why 1953 (Milgram six degrees) best represents an immutable Pleistocene.

zeynep	695484341611134977	2016-02-05T05:49:23	NAChristakis I don't see how dramatic ease of connectivity, even better than phones &amp; little cost, doesn't impact network shape.
zeynep	695483918389121024	2016-02-05T05:47:42	NAChristakis I keep in touch with friends I'd absolutely would not have without FB. This is like saying phones don't change connectivity.
zeynep	695483460849303552	2016-02-05T05:45:53	NAChristakis barrywellman So it has to be an underestimate but I'm not sure why it would be that much.
zeynep	695483223439114241	2016-02-05T05:44:56	NAChristakis barrywellman Did anyone recently find 6? Big problem with FB study is the population. FB people are online, more connected.
zeynep	695482755413467137	2016-02-05T05:43:04	jimiadams That's national. More migratory globally. More importantly, we move without losing touch.
zeynep	695482437179039744	2016-02-05T05:41:49	NAChristakis barrywellman There was a global instant messaging study that found, iirc, around 3-4. IM more intimate than even Facebook.

zeynep	694508947714236416	2016-02-02T13:13:31	ncweaver Now, it was wrapped up in the racism (not an  uncommon pairing) and he is not, well, read up on stuff. But it's ...indicative.
zeynep	694508702070611968	2016-02-02T13:12:32	ncweaver That's not completely true, imo. He talked about immigration, taxing the rich, health care, etc. A bread with GOP elite orthodoxy.
zeynep	694508414479790080	2016-02-02T13:11:24	If we can get past meaningless 1-2% differences, theme of this election is the major, global fractures causing great anxiety. Yuuuge story.
zeynep	694507668862586880	2016-02-02T13:08:26	I know "horse-race" coverage makes for better narrative writing but it's particularly pernicious when there is just about one para to write.

zeynep	694341494694617088	2016-02-02T02:08:07	nathanjurgenson Yeah noticed that. Not sure because it's a longer list or more consequential or random. Not alphabetical.

zeynep	693861232605057024	2016-01-31T18:19:43	staeiou blocktogether It should be a standard Twitter function.
zeynep	693854076430356481	2016-01-31T17:51:17	yet Everything shouldn't get called/filed under harassment. There is real harassment, a real issue, but probably much rarer than annoying.
zeynep	693853712528326656	2016-01-31T17:49:50	yet So I learned about rule! I guess Twitter has to sort private/non-private email.Rule is fine but suspension should clearly state reason.

zeynep	693852545916223491	2016-01-31T17:45:12	_ch_ase brian_carnell dongohuber I've had to counsel women who received 1000+ weird threats. So unnerving! (I could tell it was a script)
zeynep	693851487798071296	2016-01-31T17:41:00	brian_carnell dongohuber _ch_ase And then there is that. Not only are the tools too coarse, they don't even work well.
zeynep	693851280964501504	2016-01-31T17:40:11	dongohuber _ch_ase As I said, we need more intermediate choices. At the moment things are at extreme ends. So easily doable too.
zeynep	693851067579244544	2016-01-31T17:39:20	dongohuber _ch_ase People have a right not to pay  attention. Having to mute/block 100s, especially if they say horrible things is taxing.
zeynep	693850739022626818	2016-01-31T17:38:01	dongohuber _ch_ase But that's too extreme: all private (nobody can see your tweets) vs all open. A bit more fine tuning would help.
zeynep	693850188847382528	2016-01-31T17:35:50	.dongohuber _ch_ase I understand there can be scripts etc. but making people work to send unwanted communication would reduce volume.
zeynep	693850063190265860	2016-01-31T17:35:20	.dongohuber _ch_ase Nah, it's too easy for one person to keep creating egg accounts, creating a much bigger impression than they deserve.
zeynep	693845572302802945	2016-01-31T17:17:30	So there is a rule about publishing non-public email addresses. (Not a bad rule but the suspensions should clearly state reason, remedy).
zeynep	693844298694004736	2016-01-31T17:12:26	zeynep yet Here are the relevant twitter rules.  
zeynep	693843504909410305	2016-01-31T17:09:17	.yet So there is a Twitter rule that people can't publish anyone else's email address? If so, well, let us know. And what a can of worms.
zeynep	693841197400465408	2016-01-31T17:00:07	AGoldmund Empower users to better control what they see. At the moment, they are—as far as I can see—going trigger happy with suspensions.
zeynep	693840579382374401	2016-01-31T16:57:39	Also, trust me, too quick trigger on the suspensions will quickly turn to a political censorship tool--even spam reporting is used that way.
zeynep	693840154574848001	2016-01-31T16:55:58	People should be able to control their mentions much better. Going at the problem with suspensions is harder, and will create more problems.
zeynep	693839950392004610	2016-01-31T16:55:09	Suspending accounts should for true harassment rather than unwanted communication. For unwanted communication: empower people not to see it.
zeynep	693839711220154368	2016-01-31T16:54:12	Also Twitter should have an option not to see tweets from egg accounts, accounts with less than x followers, etc. Allow folks to opt-out.
zeynep	693839350723907584	2016-01-31T16:52:46	Why? Real harassment should be dealt with but not overly thin-skins. (For thin skins: empower user not to see).

zeynep	692725787372421120	2016-01-28T15:07:52	camharris_us You are probably right but worth a question mark for me if that's changed a bit, from what I've seen in other countries.
zeynep	692724691937656832	2016-01-28T15:03:31	No. 
zeynep	692724626191941633	2016-01-28T15:03:15	camharris_us I do write about importance of infrastructure a lot, I'm not discounting it at all. But the yardsticks may have moved.
zeynep	692724464006664192	2016-01-28T15:02:37	camharris_us US is certainly a high apathy voting environment but many would have said Jeb was predictable ten months ago.
zeynep	692724198121283584	2016-01-28T15:01:33	camharris_us If the persuasion has been strong enough, mobilization may matter somewhat less. We shall see.

zeynep	692723802753634304	2016-01-28T14:59:59	camharris_us So this will be fascinating to watch, but in other countries I've watched social movements with no traditional infrastructure+
zeynep	692723632846606337	2016-01-28T14:59:18	"They don't have the infrastructure" is important but less of a force especially in small-scale events like IA caucuses. We'll see.
zeynep	692723335969521669	2016-01-28T14:58:08	Of course, there is a queuing effect the consider. If the other candidates have motivated voters *and* logistics, they'll outnumber.
zeynep	692722921228353536	2016-01-28T14:56:29	Logistics has been a barrier to voting, favoring the organizationally prepared. But from other social movements we know this has changed.
zeynep	692722678441054208	2016-01-28T14:55:31	Given role of digital tools, I'm not convinced that this is as much a barrier as before if folks *are* motivated.

zeynep	692361767511552000	2016-01-27T15:01:23	Twitter needs better tools for user to control what they see. Why is it 3 clicks to block someone? It used to be two, btw. Should be one.
zeynep	692361319308267521	2016-01-27T14:59:36	What's core to Twitter? Conversation. Conversation people participate or watch. Quoting tweets breaks threads which breaks conversation.

zeynep	692357522385190912	2016-01-27T14:44:31	Twitter: way late to the group messaging. Lists which can be so useful and help new users, mostly ignored. Where's a one click "buy" tweet?

zeynep	689476274671198209	2016-01-19T15:55:28	Turkey had prior "academics mass sign petition criticizing government" crisis in 1984—when it was under martial law. 
zeynep	689475481683529733	2016-01-19T15:52:19	At this rate, 1000+ academics in Turkey may lose their jobs for signing a petition criticizing the government. They may also face jail.
zeynep	689475079638491136	2016-01-19T15:50:43	Detentions &amp; charges came after Pres. Erdogan called the academics "vile &amp; despicable." Update—potential dismissals: 
zeynep	689474446927749121	2016-01-19T15:48:12	1100+ academics in Turkey signed a petition critical of gov't policy in Kurdish regions. Some were detained, many face changes &amp; dismissal.
zeynep	689211948760715265	2016-01-18T22:25:08	brianmcc Okay, I will put this on stuff I listen to!
zeynep	689211556370993154	2016-01-18T22:23:34	brianmcc That makes sense. It's kind of incongruous there. (Though the rest of tech is actually .. the same).
zeynep	689211258617352192	2016-01-18T22:22:23	brianmcc Yes, seriously, so much history to write. The Juniper backdoor saga on Twitter was better than anything on Netflix. Great stories!
zeynep	689211027074985984	2016-01-18T22:21:28	nathanjurgenson mattdpearce It went downhill/uphill after the invention of writing. (Also Plato/Aristotle will provide a Trump hot take).

zeynep	689210424902987776	2016-01-18T22:19:04	brianmcc Will do! Sounds great. So much of this history is actually so recent. I'm not even close to retirement! :-D
zeynep	689209482887479296	2016-01-18T22:15:20	brianmcc I would love to listen to that. I connected to some very early BBS's myself, trying to remember how fast my modem was. (NOT fast).
zeynep	689206670233325570	2016-01-18T22:04:09	brianmcc I know. Kind of surprising they had a modem in there at all? Were there some BBS in the US? Nothing in Turkey for sure.
zeynep	689206499160240128	2016-01-18T22:03:28	sirosenbaum :-) and &lt;3 back. (Demonstrating proper use of punctuation and numbers on Twitter haha).
zeynep	689205322347601922	2016-01-18T21:58:48	sirosenbaum Yep. That's why I posted about someone whose momentous role at the time was basically swept under.

zeynep	689203617828630528	2016-01-18T21:52:01	sirosenbaum Ok. I don't like the postcard version of yesterday—but the past was very messy &amp; tough. To be evaluated in their own context...
zeynep	689202547274444800	2016-01-18T21:47:46	sirosenbaum chipgoines There'd be no "today's movement" without yesterday's gains which came through sacrifice &amp; different strategies.
zeynep	689193087122411521	2016-01-18T21:10:11	It's still the same, tbh, (smaller, more powerful but same). The overlooked magic was in the modem: the network.

zeynep	684504466859528192	2016-01-05T22:39:17	I'd first have tried charging 1 cent per extra character (seamlessly paid) up to, say, ~160 chars. I'd pay once a day, at least. 😂
zeynep	684503735825899520	2016-01-05T22:36:22	MaxToomey You want to read h0d3r
zeynep	684503168206548992	2016-01-05T22:34:07	Also, screenshots (which I use and study) have natural limits, too much text &amp; it did not work. Sometimes attention economy thrives on less.
zeynep	684502632828817408	2016-01-05T22:31:59	.mattblaze Better collective messaging earlier would have helped with the abuse problem, too, because one key to that is empowering groups.
zeynep	684502527736299520	2016-01-05T22:31:34	mattblaze They missed the boat on this by not making it more functional and allowing group DM messaging. Would have made people stay more.
zeynep	684501466019565568	2016-01-05T22:27:21	Messaging: so slow to roll out properly, missed boat. Can't quote tweet &amp; have it attach to thread. Blocked/mute people come back. Etc. etc.
zeynep	684501040931024902	2016-01-05T22:25:40	I can't wave magic wand to change the ad-based financing, but I'm usually baffled by Twitter's slowness of product. Wish could fix that.
zeynep	684500422086623232	2016-01-05T22:23:12	.noahmccormack AlexJamesFitz Yep. This is the kind of thing that may kill ~The Baffler, or transform it dramatically. We'll see.
zeynep	684499836977061888	2016-01-05T22:20:53	Also, jack. Screenshots will live. Sometimes the point is not to be searchable. My paper:  
zeynep	684498942604673024	2016-01-05T22:17:19	As usual, it's follow the financing model. I've written this before: we need to make the creator/user the customer. 
zeynep	684497976673177600	2016-01-05T22:13:29	._Almaqah Yep. Ad-driven platforms need huge scale and also to keep users within walls. I don't like it but here it is.
zeynep	684497752168873984	2016-01-05T22:12:36	.AlexJamesFitz I disagree: for some types of content Twitter drives links. Facebook traffic already reported lower; guess they want same.
zeynep	684497196264230913	2016-01-05T22:10:23	.BrendanEich It will effectively kill linking out, over time, for many types of content; at least that's what they *all* are trying to do.
zeynep	684496699495075841	2016-01-05T22:08:25	.BrendanEich Instead of blogging on Medium or publishing on your site, Twitter wants you to post content to its walled garden. The usual.
zeynep	684496029983506432	2016-01-05T22:05:45	(No inside knowledge but pretty sure). Twitter won't explode the timeline. Like all ad-driven platforms, It wants your attention, to sell.
zeynep	684495581432033280	2016-01-05T22:03:58	Twitter is not removing the character limit. It's killing the link. It's the walled garden for eyeballs, not length. 
zeynep	684490262144512004	2016-01-05T21:42:50	Absolutely devastating.

zeynep	684405262292107264	2016-01-05T16:05:04	FreglisPlethon Problem is safe, managed passage and global distribution to a distraught, desperate population. Rest is details, excuses.
zeynep	684405092171124736	2016-01-05T16:04:24	FreglisPlethon Sturdy ships cross all the time. Then let them come over land, as they asked, marching to Greek border. Denied.
zeynep	684404783382331392	2016-01-05T16:03:10	Great news! Meanwhile, there is close to no reporting from Turkey's major Kurdish towns under indefinite curfew. 
zeynep	684402257174081536	2016-01-05T15:53:08	FreglisPlethon It's a very short ride. Would be safe on regular boats. Those were used. Sunk/confiscated. No safe passage allowed.
zeynep	684400683878072320	2016-01-05T15:46:53	FreglisPlethon You're not following the issue. Safe/sturdy boats were used. (I don't condone smugglers). Sunk/confiscated on Greek side.
zeynep	684394377905606656	2016-01-05T15:21:49	FreglisPlethon They marched to the Greek land border, demanding safe passage. Denied, they went back to these boats. That's the issue.
zeynep	684394229641117696	2016-01-05T15:21:14	FreglisPlethon Wrong focus. The refugees themselves are knowingly taking this risk, and will continue to do so lacking safe passage.

zeynep	683686264327933959	2016-01-03T16:28:02	Thoughtful essay by zeynep on the importance of infrastructure in fostering innovation:  
zeynep	683672205822156800	2016-01-03T15:32:10	jeffjarvis An enormous amount of things in US depend on reliable, cheap and universal mail. Shifting to something else? Not soon.
zeynep	683671342961569793	2016-01-03T15:28:44	jeffjarvis Healthcare would allow more innovation, too! Anyway, taxation globally has gone so lopsided that much room for improvement.
zeynep	683670502645350401	2016-01-03T15:25:24	jeffjarvis This is a very rich country. A bit better taxation and it can easily do both. The work it would generate would help too.
zeynep	683670234566389761	2016-01-03T15:24:20	jeffjarvis Infrastructure allows innovation to thrive. That's my point. USPS can get better, sure. That's another level.
zeynep	683669699180261377	2016-01-03T15:22:12	jeffjarvis Anyway, no public infrastructure, no basis for innovation. NSF to USPS to universities. That's what made Google possible...
zeynep	683669395848216580	2016-01-03T15:21:00	jeffjarvis this can't be discussed by ignoring the deliberate attempt to bankrupt it via 75 years in advance retirement funds.
