caseyjohnston	713108223142862849	2016-03-24T21:00:23	tylercoates hmm i don't understand the question
caseyjohnston	713106979166765061	2016-03-24T20:55:27	tylercoates it could be but not based on the message board format? based on the content of what people are saying?
caseyjohnston	713106631224139776	2016-03-24T20:54:04	tylercoates would reddit criticizing an article be harassment
caseyjohnston	713105377169186816	2016-03-24T20:49:05	tylercoates ... i'm not sure how this is materially different from, say, criticizing something this way 
caseyjohnston	713104873714225152	2016-03-24T20:47:05	tylercoates it's also not about preventing people from responding to you; obviously they can't say whatever they want but...
caseyjohnston	713104542599102464	2016-03-24T20:45:46	tylercoates oh yes definitely! i mean my point is harassment isn't about juxtaposition
caseyjohnston	713103540265349121	2016-03-24T20:41:47	tylercoates BoobsRadley that definitely falls under harassment, but i thought your point was about where the information appears

caseyjohnston	713101119212429312	2016-03-24T20:32:10	tylercoates petersterne i mean yes harassment isn't about positioning; if someone puts my address anywhere on the internet and says...

caseyjohnston	713096411873742848	2016-03-24T20:13:27	tylercoates petersterne interesting, would you say the victim's feelings matter the most in this scenario? more than other factors

caseyjohnston	713086472715370497	2016-03-24T19:33:58	tylercoates petersterne i mean twitter should do a lot of things differently, twitter is not a great example
