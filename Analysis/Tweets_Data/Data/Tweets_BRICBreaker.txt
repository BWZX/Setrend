BRICBreaker	725034054148624384	2016-04-26T18:49:23	valeria_ypunto ...you guys have $5 million in a Swiss bank account. And I have about $15,000 (por ai) less in my PBR stocks.
BRICBreaker	725033905305358336	2016-04-26T18:48:48	valeria_ypunto If PBR has last oil, then it has less oil to turn into gas. BUT, PBR blew it on refineries. Instead of refineries...
BRICBreaker	725033709267750917	2016-04-26T18:48:01	valeria_ypunto ...Inflation and the fact that PBR never invested in refineries. So it has to import gasoline. Which means higher gas price.
BRICBreaker	725033611079127041	2016-04-26T18:47:38	valeria_ypunto Two points. PBR can drill in Gulf of Mexico and take the oil to Brazil if it wants. No problem. Problem in BR is...

BRICBreaker	725026091321200640	2016-04-26T18:17:45	valeria_ypunto I do think that a PMDB or PSDB gov will see ANP allow for foreign oil in pre-sal w/o PBR's 30% share. Thats possible.
BRICBreaker	725025923465093120	2016-04-26T18:17:05	valeria_ypunto its always oil, isnt it? That would be some conspiracy. And lets not forget, no one forced PT &amp; allies to rob PBR blind. ; )

BRICBreaker	725019277762387969	2016-04-26T17:50:40	Lulivianna I didnt know that and never heard that. What might happen is ANP opens pre-salt to all, w/o partnering with PBR. Possible.
