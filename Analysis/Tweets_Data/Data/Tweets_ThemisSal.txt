ThemisSal	692353378878357504	2016-01-27T14:28:03	ThemisSal nanexllc i know the answer  :)
ThemisSal	692353281339822080	2016-01-27T14:27:40	nanexllc what did 9/28/08 look like  volatile?
ThemisSal	692352326066114560	2016-01-27T14:23:52	DLauer it is a fools game to fine the ONE cause. I guess i am unclear. I am saying that without (D), we no flash crashy.

ThemisSal	692351709222432768	2016-01-27T14:21:25	pressure collapses, and aggressive leaning and exacerbating. Which is legal. But maybe that type of trading should not have short sale (3)
ThemisSal	692351532164104193	2016-01-27T14:20:43	Ilke indexarby stuff perhaps. And some high speed prop trading is aggressive, opportunistic, sensing and seeking potential for book (2)
ThemisSal	692351328459345920	2016-01-27T14:19:54	Also thinking out loud ... tangent here... Some aspects of high speed prop trading is market making, and worthy of short sale exemptions (1)

ThemisSal	692348865484361729	2016-01-27T14:10:07	RemcoLenterman hmm  So all WDR had to do is make 3 calls?
ThemisSal	692348180927795203	2016-01-27T14:07:24	RemcoLenterman maybe in 5 year lost we will have to trade in 10 share odd lots to only have a little impact? Hope not.
ThemisSal	692347846331371520	2016-01-27T14:06:04	monge25 uncertain market data... uncertainty. liquidity withdrawal very quickly. combined with book pressure = no bueno ModernMarkets

ThemisSal	692344563135074304	2016-01-27T13:53:01	RemcoLenterman or maybe it is huge today, as 6 billion today does not mean 6 times liquidity in the 90s? ie volume no equal liquidity?

ThemisSal	692342378812825600	2016-01-27T13:44:20	DLauer maybe systems should not be so complex then? maybe no PFOF. Maybe a little slower too.
ThemisSal	692342122415034368	2016-01-27T13:43:19	or.. i should say... if there was no (d), then we would not have flash crashed and rebounded.
