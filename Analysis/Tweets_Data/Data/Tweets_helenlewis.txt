helenlewis	710951525959471104	2016-03-18T22:10:27	alexmassie Yes, the multiple happy outcomes may just have coincided.
helenlewis	710951087700844544	2016-03-18T22:08:42	Hmm... Source at the DWP doesn't believe IDS's stated reasons. Says he has felt humiliated over Brexit &amp; looking for an excuse for weeks.
helenlewis	710950119810666497	2016-03-18T22:04:52	OssieSaysStuff No response to this? Last post on opposing PIP 2 hours ago... unless I can't see it?
helenlewis	710948789557841920	2016-03-18T21:59:34	rorybremner Personally think the cut was indefensible, but then I'm not a Tory! But it was clear backbenches were struggling to defend it.

helenlewis	710938176458792960	2016-03-18T21:17:24	Feeling a genuinely disorienting sensation - agreeing with IDS. (It *was* barmy to put disability cuts alongside all those giveaways.)
helenlewis	710937963224539136	2016-03-18T21:16:33	mrianleslie Happily was halfway through my "PIP U-turn" story when I had the chance to do a U-turn of my own.
helenlewis	710935641001959425	2016-03-18T21:07:20	Iain Duncan Smith resigns with a swipe at George Osborne - 
helenlewis	710932681735999490	2016-03-18T20:55:34	Woah... wonder if this is a response to the Treasury dumping the PIP u-turn on the DWP? 
helenlewis	710886216397430788	2016-03-18T17:50:56	Spent this afternoon in the podcast bunker, talking about the best century . . .

helenlewis	710765550956388352	2016-03-18T09:51:27	dats AbiWilks So publishers are as irritated as consumers. But there's an advantage for ad buyers who break rules. Prisoners dilemma.
helenlewis	710765140736606210	2016-03-18T09:49:49	dats AbiWilks It inevitably takes time to identify and ban the advert in question. And there's no comeback from law/regulator.
helenlewis	710764921500336128	2016-03-18T09:48:57	dats AbiWilks It's not deliberate. Realtime bidding on MPUs means companies buy a slot &amp; run unauthorised code in it.
helenlewis	710750866295365632	2016-03-18T08:53:06	mrianleslie Enjoy: 
helenlewis	710738752411443200	2016-03-18T08:04:58	Also, in 2013 the NewStatesman spoke to several Paralympians who used the predecessor to PIP (DLA) to eg modify a car to get to training.
helenlewis	710737565310197760	2016-03-18T08:00:15	BTW, not sure everyone knows what PIP is for. Lots claiming it are in work &amp; will struggle to keep jobs if it's cut. 
helenlewis	710735977690624000	2016-03-18T07:53:56	Gilesyb stephenkb Scrapping the 50p rate showed there was money. Made other decisions look ideological rather than "sadly necessary".

helenlewis	710598746086764545	2016-03-17T22:48:38	PeteNewbon mjrobbins Basically I suspect you'll be able to cherry pick evidence for whatever thesis you want to advance.
helenlewis	710598582114623488	2016-03-17T22:47:58	PeteNewbon mjrobbins Suspect instead it will do OK; plus maybe win London; power-share in Wales; come 3rd in Scotland. Total mixed bag.
helenlewis	710598330338906112	2016-03-17T22:46:58	PeteNewbon mjrobbins *Nate Silver face* Yes &amp; no. They're in disproportionately Labour-leaning areas, so party *should* do v v well.

helenlewis	710372481786388481	2016-03-17T07:49:32	This feels pretty grim in a Budget which raised the 40p tax threshold to £45,000 -a cut for upper-middle class.

helenlewis	709684518186307584	2016-03-15T10:15:49	tomwhx Not sure they're easily disentangled. The policy was developed very fast, which inevitably means stuff was done "on the hoof".
helenlewis	709645645234233344	2016-03-15T07:41:21	Important read (particularly if you support free schools). Seeing how sausage is made = better policy in future.

helenlewis	706046188412346368	2016-03-05T09:18:23	susangardenct Yes, although statistically the vast majority of sex-buyers are men. I think the voices of buyers should be heard more.

helenlewis	685802895325937665	2016-01-09T12:38:46	magpie_ms sharpeleven The whole thrust of the floods discussion was criticising the govt &amp; govt agencies. V misleading not to say that.

helenlewis	685772855439683584	2016-01-09T10:39:24	@steffanjohn Really? Was a big debate 5 years ago. 
helenlewis	685771406194380802	2016-01-09T10:33:38	A more active refugee policy could engage with this as a policy challenge, as Canada has done. 
helenlewis	685770946251255808	2016-01-09T10:31:49	So the demographics of the refugee crisis do present a challenge. Places like Calais camps are disproportionately full of young men.
helenlewis	685770424790179840	2016-01-09T10:29:44	JS Mill wrote about it in Subjection of Women (h/t boodleoops) 
helenlewis	685770181109506048	2016-01-09T10:28:46	It drives Gamerg*ate &amp; much men's rights activism and anti-feminism ("why are m/c ladies complaining, they should move to Saudi Arabia")…
helenlewis	685769778439569408	2016-01-09T10:27:10	But there is an important point. Again &amp; again we see men who feel marginalised, disrespected &amp; who have lost status take that out on women.
helenlewis	685769562084765696	2016-01-09T10:26:19	Also, on Cologne (and on the tiresome idea "feminists have nothing to say about it"), this is badly worded IMO 
helenlewis	685766576696606722	2016-01-09T10:14:27	alexmassie But try arguing "Labour only winning the mayoralty by a whisker shows Corbyn is a liability". It won't wash with grassroots.
helenlewis	685766364171218944	2016-01-09T10:13:36	alexmassie Yes, definitely. Labour *ought* to walk it, given demographics &amp; the massive boost to CLP membership since August.
helenlewis	685765866227675136	2016-01-09T10:11:38	LouieWoodall montie It's also possible the local results will be merely dreary rather than apocalyptic.
helenlewis	685762494825119744	2016-01-09T09:58:14	So even if local results are dire, the overall mixed picture means you can cherry pick results to suit whatever narrative you want.
helenlewis	685762137508163584	2016-01-09T09:56:49	Sadiq Khan currently 10pts ahead of Zac Goldsmith; Labour likely to remain in govt in Wales; and Scottish bloodbath already "priced in".
helenlewis	685761806988668928	2016-01-09T09:55:30	On the elections, my takeaway is that any Corbyn critics hoping bad election results will prompt a backlash &amp; a coup will be disappointed.
