TheFemKilljoy	723247723898646528	2016-04-21T20:31:09	So I think I've decided not to retake.
TheFemKilljoy	723247608748249088	2016-04-21T20:30:41	It's uncomfortable. And I feel so terrible about infringing on what little space they have.

TheFemKilljoy	723246694238957569	2016-04-21T20:27:03	And right now my life is kind of in limbo.
TheFemKilljoy	723246577570160643	2016-04-21T20:26:36	But now I feel like going has done more harm than good. Because it gave everyone unrealistic expectations, myself included.
TheFemKilljoy	723246358245847045	2016-04-21T20:25:43	I figured in the very least, a trial run couldn't hurt.

TheFemKilljoy	719285711468437504	2016-04-10T22:07:31	As in rapidly trying to process that my father is for better or worse a gas station fried chicken connoisseur, 2007 hits me like a brick

TheFemKilljoy	719283210836971520	2016-04-10T21:57:35	That was 8.5 years ago, when my father first moved me to Oxford. Today, he moved me out of Oxford.

TheFemKilljoy	716375466106560512	2016-04-02T21:23:15	So I grab my change and run to the bathroom and sweet jesus

TheFemKilljoy	716374815523926018	2016-04-02T21:20:40	And the employee says "for paying customers only"
TheFemKilljoy	716374663195201536	2016-04-02T21:20:03	And I ask if they have a restroom.
TheFemKilljoy	716374584489078786	2016-04-02T21:19:45	So I run in this pet store not far.

TheFemKilljoy	711226081685143552	2016-03-19T16:21:26	Bae said "You can just get new plants, honey," and I gasped in horror like he just told me he was a child murderer.

TheFemKilljoy	711225454565392384	2016-03-19T16:18:56	I'll get some much needed beach time while I line up a job and finding a place. I've been homesick for years. This will be so great for me.
TheFemKilljoy	711223670283354113	2016-03-19T16:11:51	First and most important thing is to get me outta this fucking mold so I can recover completely and finally be in good health. Jfc
TheFemKilljoy	711221584099463170	2016-03-19T16:03:34	Oxford has been good to me. This University has been soo good to me. But I've done all I came here to do.
TheFemKilljoy	711221165566664704	2016-03-19T16:01:54	I could stay here, comfortable, being great at serving people food in North Mississippi. But I am capable of so much more and now I'm ready.
TheFemKilljoy	711220625017331713	2016-03-19T15:59:45	I could easily get complacent here. It's not a bad life, so that would be easy to do. But this is not what I set out to do.
TheFemKilljoy	711219876334067712	2016-03-19T15:56:47	I've lived in Oxford longer than anywhere else in my life. I did the math and . 1/3 of my life. A damn third!
TheFemKilljoy	711219292134625284	2016-03-19T15:54:27	And let's be honest, it's time.
TheFemKilljoy	711218997325389824	2016-03-19T15:53:17	I will do this. One day at a time. And with the unrelenting support of unbelievable family &amp; friends. Just like everything else I have done.
TheFemKilljoy	711218223862169600	2016-03-19T15:50:13	Anyway, I still feel this is the right decision. To move. My mental Macarena has not changed anything. Forward, I shall go.

TheFemKilljoy	711217647376048128	2016-03-19T15:47:55	I dream of the day my life no longer revolves around exam taking.
TheFemKilljoy	711217521215545345	2016-03-19T15:47:25	dmarknewman I was like OH COME ON
TheFemKilljoy	711217179610517504	2016-03-19T15:46:04	However, this pencil still far superior than the pencil they gave me for Bar exam WITH TEETH MARKS.
TheFemKilljoy	711216793642258433	2016-03-19T15:44:32	This here pencil is gonna take you to the top, FKJ. It will do.
TheFemKilljoy	711216554122321920	2016-03-19T15:43:34	I have no idea where that pencil even came from. I probably found it in a drawer 20 years ago.
TheFemKilljoy	711216274462920704	2016-03-19T15:42:28	Let me show y'all this pencil I was prepared to try to become a lawyer with. Passport for size comparison. 
TheFemKilljoy	711215817984180224	2016-03-19T15:40:39	I was able to locate one no. 2 pencil in my house. ONE. In my toolbox. For handy work and home projects.
TheFemKilljoy	711215581597405184	2016-03-19T15:39:43	"Well…shit."
TheFemKilljoy	711215453515988993	2016-03-19T15:39:12	Remember that slew of just adorably decorative pencils I posted yesterday? Nowhere on them or their packaging is it confirmed they're no. 2.
TheFemKilljoy	711215190721892352	2016-03-19T15:38:09	Then, in the midst of that meltdown, I noticed on my instructions for my exam this morning that you're to bring your own no. 2 pencils.
TheFemKilljoy	711214950610542593	2016-03-19T15:37:12	"PLANTS CAN'T SURVIVE IN A STORAGE UNIT. THEY NEED SUNLIGHT. THAT'S HOW THEY LIVE!"
TheFemKilljoy	711214723593871360	2016-03-19T15:36:18	Ultimately fretting over "What about my plants? What's going to happen to my plants?!"
TheFemKilljoy	711214541888229378	2016-03-19T15:35:35	I went through about 17,000 more what if's.
TheFemKilljoy	711214425852792835	2016-03-19T15:35:07	"Hmm, well I don't have a job. Or a home."
TheFemKilljoy	711214360354557953	2016-03-19T15:34:51	I realized errrthang is about to change. Then my mind could just nottt be detonated.
TheFemKilljoy	711214145845198849	2016-03-19T15:34:00	So p sure last night I experienced a 6-hour long anxiety attack.

TheFemKilljoy	710992571728703488	2016-03-19T00:53:33	Personally I was stunned they don't get that question like, all the time.
TheFemKilljoy	710992442762264577	2016-03-19T00:53:02	After several seconds of awkward silence, they burst into laughter.
TheFemKilljoy	710992334305951744	2016-03-19T00:52:36	I had to trade in my old phone so I said, "Wait should I delete my nudes?" The two employees paused, looked at each other. +
