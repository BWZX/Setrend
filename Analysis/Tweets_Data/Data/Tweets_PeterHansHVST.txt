PeterHansHVST	679686968473616384	2015-12-23T15:36:15	gwestr jbaksht it's one of those overhangs that can't be alleviated with a catalyst and I see growth assumptions being scrutinized
PeterHansHVST	679686704156950528	2015-12-23T15:35:12	gwestr jbaksht there is certainly a lot of growth assumed in the current valuation. I don't think more cases is needed
