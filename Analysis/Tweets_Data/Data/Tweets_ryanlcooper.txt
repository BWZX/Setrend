ryanlcooper	724986478825189376	2016-04-26T15:40:20	delong meaning "is more fiscal stimulus good/bad" instead of 20 pages of equations about whether Friedman's model was right

ryanlcooper	723588888212725760	2016-04-22T19:06:49	currently being trolled by the limpest conservative in history. I had to teach him how to reply to tweets
ryanlcooper	723588726711046144	2016-04-22T19:06:10	MattBruenig (ironically it would have been way more expensive for me to go to public school in CO due to huge need-based aid @ Reed)

ryanlcooper	723586580087185408	2016-04-22T18:57:38	nmiamifl amazing how a couple tweets didn't convince someone to burn down a worldview built up over decades of reading and learning
ryanlcooper	723586372301365248	2016-04-22T18:56:49	MattBruenig I would have guessed, rich private schools generally have a whole fluffy surveillance apparatus looking after people
ryanlcooper	723585976640122887	2016-04-22T18:55:15	nmiamifl nope, I disagree. big government is good and how decent countries provide for their citizens

ryanlcooper	723585571826896896	2016-04-22T18:53:38	MattBruenig I imagine state schools don't have that same fussy oversight
ryanlcooper	723585325927403520	2016-04-22T18:52:39	MattBruenig hahah shootfire. I recall a couple people akin to that at Reed, but people would always help them out w/leftovers and such

ryanlcooper	723583661325557761	2016-04-22T18:46:03	nmiamifl what are you attempting to accomplish with these tweets
ryanlcooper	723583137087938567	2016-04-22T18:43:58	nmiamifl actually national debt is too small
ryanlcooper	723582587873140740	2016-04-22T18:41:47	MattBruenig on purpose, or just lacking food?
ryanlcooper	723581870601048065	2016-04-22T18:38:56	MattBruenig you gone that long? I've never made it more than 1 day myself
ryanlcooper	723581684805959684	2016-04-22T18:38:11	nmiamifl but we can get paid leave, a child allowance, and free college first from the rich first :-D
ryanlcooper	723581405683417088	2016-04-22T18:37:05	nmiamifl eventually probably yeah, can't get taxes up to ~45% of GDP without the middle class chipping in

ryanlcooper	723575839800045568	2016-04-22T18:14:58	Nicholas_Warino yeah, getting costs down would really help with that first initial bite, which could be *massive*

ryanlcooper	723575398802558976	2016-04-22T18:13:13	nmiamifl I mean *sort of,* but mostly because I hate giving rich people money they don't need
ryanlcooper	723575180359024640	2016-04-22T18:12:21	Nicholas_Warino I couldn't tell you, frankly. I know a larger market would make it somewhat easier, but the tax hikes would be real big

ryanlcooper	722553857499209728	2016-04-19T22:33:58	karengeier yeah, it's a damn pain -- and also applies to stuff like punishment for murder and how bail works and such

ryanlcooper	722266292883963905	2016-04-19T03:31:17	but some do, but still do both at the same time. for example: 
ryanlcooper	722266101602742273	2016-04-19T03:30:32	most wonks are generalists/popularizers with some surface knowledge but not actual hardcore expertise

ryanlcooper	722263610316165120	2016-04-19T03:20:38	chrislhayes perhaps because it was adopted by generalists who do not actually have much detailed policy expertise!
ryanlcooper	722263040385802240	2016-04-19T03:18:22	chrislhayes true, but I'm referring to wonk not as "expert," but as the Gatekeepers of Economic Policy Consensus

ryanlcooper	714985059850137600	2016-03-30T01:18:16	JonathanCohn no, they have grades and GPAs. they don't tell you what they are though unless you specifically ask
ryanlcooper	714983953782820864	2016-03-30T01:13:52	JonathanCohn I probably only took about 5 non-quantitative courses during my college years, heh
ryanlcooper	714982817260654593	2016-03-30T01:09:22	JonathanCohn fair

ryanlcooper	714980281380245504	2016-03-30T00:59:17	TheGreatLarue1 JonathanCohn right, that's just what my p-chem prof used to say. subject goes on for like 4 more grad courses
ryanlcooper	714979859408158720	2016-03-30T00:57:36	JonathanCohn (I should mention that they generally didn't even tell you your grade, unless you failed)
ryanlcooper	714979692386758656	2016-03-30T00:56:57	JonathanCohn I couldn't disagree more. it was the best, fairest, least competitive learning environment I've ever experienced
ryanlcooper	714978718972641281	2016-03-30T00:53:04	JonathanCohn the point being to make them so hard that they were an extreme challenge even for the extremely bright students
ryanlcooper	714978511086223360	2016-03-30T00:52:15	JonathanCohn again, you're using a wrong definition of failure here. 50% in statistical thermodynamics was good and worthy of praise
ryanlcooper	714977561399328768	2016-03-30T00:48:28	JonathanCohn if the average was 50% then that was usually a C+ or so, not failing
ryanlcooper	714977371393122304	2016-03-30T00:47:43	JonathanCohn I would strongly disagree. there's nothing wrong with deliberate difficulty so long as the curve is fair

ryanlcooper	714976584654987264	2016-03-30T00:44:36	JonathanCohn yeah, that's less good. way it was at Reed was the tests were incredibly hard and the average was usually like 50

ryanlcooper	714975784859873280	2016-03-30T00:41:25	JonathanCohn not exactly. if everyone at Harvard gets an automatic 3.7, then they get a leg up on other grads regardless of inflation

ryanlcooper	712420830886494208	2016-03-22T23:28:56	AngryBlackLady well, sorry to come across like that. I just think it's a mistake to be dismissive of class issues
ryanlcooper	712420388039303169	2016-03-22T23:27:11	AngryBlackLady your article is pretty good! if that perspective came through in your tweet I would have no criticism

ryanlcooper	712418158699622401	2016-03-22T23:18:19	AngryBlackLady of course people are free to set their personal priorities, just don't be dismissive of class issues is my argument
ryanlcooper	712417867107467264	2016-03-22T23:17:10	AngryBlackLady the foreclosure crisis has hit black people by far the hardest. I'd say insiders have an obligation to recognize that
ryanlcooper	712417555982344194	2016-03-22T23:15:56	AngryBlackLady "I literally don't care about big banks" is a pretty categorical statement even coupled to concern about police violence
ryanlcooper	712416958692524032	2016-03-22T23:13:33	I see the late 90s and see a potentially attainable goal. others see it as an outlier to be preemptively dismissed as impossible

ryanlcooper	712411341412114432	2016-03-22T22:51:14	KillerMartinis yeah, and this especially holds for low-class people who don't have options
ryanlcooper	712411166656466944	2016-03-22T22:50:32	purely hypothetically, I'd make common cause with former foreclosure attorneys -- but not ones who say "I don't care about big banks"

ryanlcooper	712068769611272192	2016-03-22T00:09:58	rbottoms haha
ryanlcooper	712068548919566336	2016-03-22T00:09:06	jbouie tanehisicoates yes, and that's why it sucks so much!
ryanlcooper	712068411610664962	2016-03-22T00:08:33	socialists are often somewhat un-woke on racial issues but liberals just as often have the same problem on class
ryanlcooper	712067847791316992	2016-03-22T00:06:19	if there's one argument that I hate, it's "New Deal was racist -&gt; all economic egalitarian policy is racist"
ryanlcooper	712067544832565249	2016-03-22T00:05:06	rbottoms well, I'm trying to get poor whites to sign up with social democracy. might not work but worth a shot
ryanlcooper	712066797176926209	2016-03-22T00:02:08	rbottoms and now their literal lives 
ryanlcooper	712066708421226497	2016-03-22T00:01:47	rbottoms yes, at the cost of the destruction of their moral lives and common decency
ryanlcooper	712066007070707712	2016-03-21T23:59:00	rbottoms racism sort of "helped" them in a transitory way, but the side effects were grotesque and ongoing
ryanlcooper	712065807870627841	2016-03-21T23:58:12	rbottoms no, it was something a great many whites wanted, but it's akin to an alcoholic and liquor
ryanlcooper	712064968200314880	2016-03-21T23:54:52	rbottoms this is pretty much exactly my argument. racism has prevented working class unity and thus any sort of socialism
ryanlcooper	712064579354775552	2016-03-21T23:53:19	I keep returning to this surlyurbanist post on class &amp; race 
ryanlcooper	712063254604845057	2016-03-21T23:48:04	tanehisicoates poor whites were definitely complicit, but lack of a decent welfare state is literally killing them 
ryanlcooper	712062715590606848	2016-03-21T23:45:55	rbottoms I know all about midcentury economic trends, what does this have to do with the practicality of universalist socialism
ryanlcooper	712060784130412544	2016-03-21T23:38:15	tanehisicoates dylanmatt how about "racism prevented the working-class equality upon which any socialist movement must be based"
