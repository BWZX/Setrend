DLind	726093000082857984	2016-04-29T16:57:16	germanrlopez I am not at all convinced that most Dems want broad reform, either (tho Leahy certainly does).

DLind	725360690576412672	2016-04-27T16:27:19	If your problem re Hastert is NOT child molestation, but something else (hypocrisy? refusal to make amends?), I want you to own that too.

DLind	720657632000802817	2016-04-14T16:59:03	And look. I'm torn on this. Because at the federal level, reducing drug sentences really is where it's at. 
DLind	720656280549986304	2016-04-14T16:53:41	If that Grassley memo on CJ reform's correct, Senate's giving in wholly to dangerous myth of the "violent" offender.

DLind	718434548715917312	2016-04-08T13:45:18	jefffreyspies +Furthermore, it's arguably more sensible to talk abt crime rates as absolutes — "crime is too high" — rather than deltas.

DLind	716674027306270725	2016-04-03T17:09:37	DougSaunders But that plays into idea that 9/11 was a "wakeup call," whereas it was more like a running to a parent's bed for rest of night
DLind	716672836367200259	2016-04-03T17:04:53	13. To sum: 9/11 wasn’t our Pearl Harbor, it was backwards D-Day. We lived the 1940s in reverse. (&amp; now are in the 1970s, go figure.)
DLind	716672485618540544	2016-04-03T17:03:30	12. From there: Obama-era protest movements (Tea Party/Occupy/BLM/campus activism) go from more-&gt;less tied to politics/policy.

DLind	716672116859539458	2016-04-03T17:02:02	9. Re a) took til GWB’s 2nd term for antiwar dissent to be effectual. &amp; public opinion flipped quickly. So still no deep, equal divide.
DLind	716671742731804673	2016-04-03T17:00:33	8. &amp; circa-2004 “red/blue America” talk obscured a) relative similarity of parties; b) lack of ideological conflict outside politics.
DLind	716671685659860993	2016-04-03T17:00:19	7. 9/11 ruptured that in some ways. But replacing unity of Everybody’s Doing Fine w/unity of Patriotism is still a hegemony.
DLind	716671546325078016	2016-04-03T16:59:46	6. (Clinton’s impeachment seems like it ought to complicate this? Not sure; someone else should consider.)
DLind	716671467296043008	2016-04-03T16:59:27	5. w/20 years hindsight, it seems to be true that late 1990s were comparably quietist to 1950s.
DLind	716671362895593472	2016-04-03T16:59:02	4. 9/11 was crammed down our throats as Defining. It wasn’t. Iraq War? Sure, but not as much, I think, as we thought/were told at time.
DLind	716671284713824261	2016-04-03T16:58:44	3. This shift’s been hard to spot in part, I think, bc our cohort was told by elders that defining events of our gen had already happened.
DLind	716671232628944896	2016-04-03T16:58:31	2. There was activism, but not consensus that what happens on campuses is extension/intensification of national mood.
DLind	716671139536367617	2016-04-03T16:58:09	1. To state the obvious: relative to now, those of us who went to college pre-Great Recession lived under political quietism.
DLind	716662090212241408	2016-04-03T16:22:11	loisbeckett Money, mostly. Pubs rarely seem interested in "sending X to report on Y" when X is usually an "expert" or "critic."

DLind	716661392510754817	2016-04-03T16:19:25	loisbeckett Yes. Investing in reporting seems esp relevant to me bc even eg academics with access to brands don't have access to that

DLind	715264186327105536	2016-03-30T19:47:25	nhsilk Not necessarily. Extend idea of mitigating circumstances: still a crime, but more understandable for X reason, so less punishment.
