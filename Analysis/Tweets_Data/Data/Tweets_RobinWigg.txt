RobinWigg	721467443349168128	2016-04-16T22:36:57	georgepearkes yeah...

RobinWigg	721460402392023040	2016-04-16T22:08:58	IvanTheK mark_dow yeah agree on that one.
RobinWigg	721460218341826560	2016-04-16T22:08:14	mark_dow IvanTheK oh yes totally but that IS illegal. It's more they see part of an order executed one venue and race to bid up elsewhere.
RobinWigg	721459903055978497	2016-04-16T22:06:59	mark_dow IvanTheK But the leakage is that someone sees an infinitesimal difference between the price on two venues and arbs it.
RobinWigg	721458901099655168	2016-04-16T22:03:00	mark_dow IvanTheK But how? If you see UST 5s and 10s out of whack should it be illegal for you to take advantage?

RobinWigg	721454561425297408	2016-04-16T21:45:46	IvanTheK mark_dow But people only see executed bit of order so they have to guess whether more coming? That's where anticipation comes in.
