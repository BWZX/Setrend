TFMkts	723654265332445184	2016-04-22T23:26:36	munilass lcdnews also why I never think distressed should be expressed as spread or yield - misleading

TFMkts	723624681115377665	2016-04-22T21:29:02	Pgrills24 nothing wrong with it - I understand it and could see doing it too - just wild vix flows dwarf equity ETF/ETN flows ytd
TFMkts	723624233637650432	2016-04-22T21:27:16	TFMkts -You are right.  You have got fascinated as well. I've played vol in the PA, but measured and not levered.
TFMkts	723624284317442048	2016-04-22T21:27:28	RobInTheBlack selling_theta yes though 13 to 20 is some insane percentage move (especially leveraged) which I guess is the appeal
TFMkts	723623904711983106	2016-04-22T21:25:57	Pgrills24 I think we are seeing the creation of a new dynamic that is largely being ignored - I'm just trying to understand it :)
TFMkts	723623728865751041	2016-04-22T21:25:15	Pgrills24 it reminds me of CDX when IG bond people mocked it or HYG JNK when HY people ignored

TFMkts	723621499119243268	2016-04-22T21:16:24	georgepearkes selling_theta yes, but it would be better if it portrayed what was invested in and how they worked - Not VIX
TFMkts	723621322488684545	2016-04-22T21:15:42	RobInTheBlack selling_theta one thing that annoys me is I see these products &amp; graphs of vix attached - rarely of index they follow
