zervoscorfu	714855819553214464	2016-03-29T16:44:43	All in, this speech is about as dovish as you could get. It completely nullifies the Bullard/Williams/Lockhart hawkish pivots post the FOMC!
zervoscorfu	714855039169392640	2016-03-29T16:41:37	Janet's 2016 actual inflation expectations are very dovish. And her worries on measures of inflation expectations are dovish as well!
zervoscorfu	714854649543700480	2016-03-29T16:40:04	Janet's statement on uncertainty surrounding Chinese currency policy suggests our "detente" concept is very much alive &amp; well.
zervoscorfu	714853969324032006	2016-03-29T16:37:22	Janet's discussion on asymmetries in the ability of policy to react is extremely dovish!
zervoscorfu	713469807174156288	2016-03-25T20:57:12	Cool piece - makes sense. A neo-Fisherian view of why lower oil prices didn't cause much of a pop in eco activity.

zervoscorfu	701105559165124614	2016-02-20T18:06:05	Hope Fed officials go full dovish on rate outlook this week. DXY sharply lower will FINALLY then force the ECB &amp; BoJ to do the right thing!

zervoscorfu	698158414199914496	2016-02-12T14:55:11	Borrowing at -2 and lending at +2 is the same as borrowing at 0 and lending at +4 for a bank. All this whining over NIRP seems misplaced!

zervoscorfu	697455176811225088	2016-02-10T16:20:46	Never seen both sides hate so much on the Fed. They blame every problem of their own creation on the Fed. Insanity 
zervoscorfu	697419325528023040	2016-02-10T13:58:19	I love how in the last sentence Janet uses "effective lower bound" and not "zero lower bound"!!!

zervoscorfu	694537977616338944	2016-02-02T15:08:52	Interesting RyanDetrick. I guess 12% in two was just too much to keep SPX stable. But -25 on spoos not too bad! 
zervoscorfu	694258843535151105	2016-02-01T20:39:41	ES +0.5% &amp; CL -6.5% today - maybe people FINALLY waking to the the fact that lower oil is actually GOOD for the US!!
zervoscorfu	694234494308610048	2016-02-01T19:02:56	Nice read from ojblanchard1. Basically making the argument that multiples shud be higher give the rate structure!

zervoscorfu	690974820998254592	2016-01-23T19:10:09	RajaKorman I missed it where Lagarde called for additional capital controls in China. Can u point that out please?
zervoscorfu	690960166678851585	2016-01-23T18:11:55	Tolu_Bu "Awkward" seems awfully polite in this situation!!
zervoscorfu	690956868676620288	2016-01-23T17:58:49	Are we suppose to worry when the head of a G3 central bank proposes capital controls as the best solution?

zervoscorfu	690177542049918976	2016-01-21T14:22:03	Draghi Q&amp;A basically saying he's locked &amp; loaded. Helpful, but in a few minutes we all go back to trading CL futures &amp; the oil margin call
zervoscorfu	690167194295144448	2016-01-21T13:40:56	Love Draghi's intonations!! So much more supportive than Dec. He is seeking redemption!! Can't wait for the Q and A!
