ThePlumLineGS	726117635449040901	2016-04-29T18:35:09	DailyTrix let's see what happens in the next couple of weeks
ThePlumLineGS	726116319515557889	2016-04-29T18:29:55	DailyTrix Sorry, but I don't think he's uniformly awful. I'll try to be more simplistic and un-nuanced going forward.
ThePlumLineGS	726114445261414400	2016-04-29T18:22:28	armandodkos Stop playing games. You know full well that Bernie and his top advisers have all said they won't go Bernie or Bust.

ThePlumLineGS	726113921451569153	2016-04-29T18:20:24	armandodkos not sure why you'd tweet this at me, since I think Bernie should concede before convention and have said so repeatedly

ThePlumLineGS	726107235336724480	2016-04-29T17:53:49	KevinMFeeney kdrum I'm arguing that this is not necessarily true.
ThePlumLineGS	726107122862161920	2016-04-29T17:53:23	KevinMFeeney  I'm responding by pointing out there are many positives to how he's handled this, and he can make it better going forward
ThePlumLineGS	726106576340287489	2016-04-29T17:51:12	KevinMFeeney right -- I'm arguing that he is a vehicle for entry. and that he can turn that into a positive thing going forward.
ThePlumLineGS	726105937375842305	2016-04-29T17:48:40	KevinMFeeney that is irrelevant. they are voting for him, and not for her. please stop citing this fact as if it says anything.

ThePlumLineGS	725729791224205312	2016-04-28T16:54:00	howserob Okay. Apparently you're either being willfully dishonest or you struggle with basic reading comp. Either way, I'm done.
ThePlumLineGS	725729497778163712	2016-04-28T16:52:50	howserob This is silly. Look, if you want to go around baselessly accusing people of deception, that's up to you. I'll move on now.
ThePlumLineGS	725729157691355136	2016-04-28T16:51:29	SethAbramson I think both camps bear responsibility for making it go smoothly. Do you?
ThePlumLineGS	725728598255108096	2016-04-28T16:49:15	SethAbramson I have repeatedly said Clinton should not be dismissive of Bernie's achievements.
ThePlumLineGS	725728398857916417	2016-04-28T16:48:28	howserob Right -- I predict it will end soon after California. That doesn't mean the Sanders campaign has made any "decisions."
ThePlumLineGS	725727989565153285	2016-04-28T16:46:50	SethAbramson I disagree -- I think his voice carries weight among progressives nationally.
ThePlumLineGS	725727827212029952	2016-04-28T16:46:12	howserob I never said otherwise. I said their top supporters are signaling how a potential reconciliation might happen when it's all over.

ThePlumLineGS	725334164602494977	2016-04-27T14:41:55	MinortyMajority ed_kilgore We have to get past this idea that this is about what to do "for Bernie."

ThePlumLineGS	725332565327007744	2016-04-27T14:35:34	we_are_toast ed_kilgore this "hostage" claim is silly. He did no such thing.
ThePlumLineGS	725331755671150595	2016-04-27T14:32:21	thebao ed_kilgore Really? None? What about this one: 
ThePlumLineGS	725330911349342208	2016-04-27T14:28:59	tinaissa thanks!
ThePlumLineGS	725328582562746368	2016-04-27T14:19:44	tinaissa no, the point is that her "actions" over the years present a much more complex picture than the one you are presenting.
ThePlumLineGS	725326252052197376	2016-04-27T14:10:29	tinaissa Absurdly oversimplified version of who she is and what she stands for. Sherrod is much closer to  the mark.
ThePlumLineGS	725325874883649536	2016-04-27T14:08:59	I think ed_kilgore is right: It wouldn't be hard for Clinton to make meaningful unity moves towards Sanders:

ThePlumLineGS	725320955262828545	2016-04-27T13:49:26	DKThomp Beyond Ross, Trump has widely been treated for months as if he exists in a vacuum, with voters/GOP leaders playing no role
ThePlumLineGS	725320635770101761	2016-04-27T13:48:10	DouthatNYT Sure. More generally there has been this odd tendency to cover/lament/rail at Trump as if he exists in a vacuum
ThePlumLineGS	725320473098240001	2016-04-27T13:47:31	DouthatNYT Ahh. That makes more sense, thanks
ThePlumLineGS	725320051298041858	2016-04-27T13:45:50	Love this idea that Trump is "killing" this or that ideology.  As if GOP voters have no hand in choosing Trump over the alternatives.

ThePlumLineGS	725313586445336576	2016-04-27T13:20:09	Trump's core delusion here is that he really thinks it projects strength, when in fact it reveals weakness: 
ThePlumLineGS	725311311618408449	2016-04-27T13:11:06	Trump just said he'll have to "get used" to Hillary's "shouting." That says a lot about the fight to come:

ThePlumLineGS	725304936624455680	2016-04-27T12:45:47	mtomasky Nobody is saying "placate"; the question is what's in the best interests for the party

ThePlumLineGS	724994181609971712	2016-04-26T16:10:57	langwiser Or maybe, just maybe, she did the right thing?
ThePlumLineGS	724987921028288512	2016-04-26T15:46:04	jujueyeball I don't know, but she supports overturning CU and expanding Dodd Frank.

ThePlumLineGS	724986966777946116	2016-04-26T15:42:17	jujueyeball True. I don't claim they don't have differences. I'm just saying they aren't as vast as some say they are.
ThePlumLineGS	724986588472709120	2016-04-26T15:40:46	jujueyeball that's probably true, but we are not getting single payer anytime soon no matter who is president

ThePlumLineGS	724986217859833857	2016-04-26T15:39:18	jujueyeball It's a difference, but both want universal health care.
ThePlumLineGS	724985094507778048	2016-04-26T15:34:50	jujueyeball Hillary: $12-$15 minimum wage; legalize 11 million; implement global climate deal; pay equity; build on Dodd-Frank

ThePlumLineGS	724941817901404160	2016-04-26T12:42:52	peterdaou Whatever "the narrative" is, Bernie's achievements with young voters should not be sneered at.
ThePlumLineGS	724941643053436928	2016-04-26T12:42:11	armandodkos neeratanden I thought you were fine with him continuing through CA?
ThePlumLineGS	724941366191599616	2016-04-26T12:41:05	neeratanden Hesiod2k11 that's fair
ThePlumLineGS	724940968160583681	2016-04-26T12:39:30	peterdaou The piece that Neera is responding to said that explicitly.
ThePlumLineGS	724940585933615104	2016-04-26T12:37:59	neeratanden Yes, and he went too far at times. But this is a campaign. This sort of thing happens!
ThePlumLineGS	724940322275479552	2016-04-26T12:36:56	Hesiod2k11 This is just misdirection; I have zero interest in continuing this. Bye.
ThePlumLineGS	724939895215677440	2016-04-26T12:35:14	Hesiod2k11 neeratanden If your point is that Clinton should smugly take the support of Bernie backers for granted, I disagree.
ThePlumLineGS	724938642834243584	2016-04-26T12:30:15	neeratanden I think Bernie has gone too far in that dept, but Clinton peeps shouldn't have heads in sand about larger importance of this
ThePlumLineGS	724935664953888768	2016-04-26T12:18:25	MicrowavedBageI let's not go overboard with the grievance.
ThePlumLineGS	724932858540888064	2016-04-26T12:07:16	RightonCarl it actually could matter in the general election; Clinton supporters should not have heads in sand about it.
ThePlumLineGS	724928386552991745	2016-04-26T11:49:30	Sanders viewed favorably by 54% of young voters nationwide (all parties). Clinton viewed unfavorably by 53% of them 
ThePlumLineGS	724924057452482560	2016-04-26T11:32:18	Vanna_Black I never said anything remotely like that.
ThePlumLineGS	724923576835543040	2016-04-26T11:30:23	In one very important sense, Bernie Sanders has already won:  
ThePlumLineGS	724918816422137856	2016-04-26T11:11:28	Punditry:  1) Draw specious Trump/Sanders equivalence  2) Smugly claim voters want "third party" &amp; "disruption"  3) Get booked on cable

ThePlumLineGS	724682756370890752	2016-04-25T19:33:27	This poll also has data that goes to the heart of the questions jbouie raises about future of Bernie movement: 
ThePlumLineGS	724670713592950785	2016-04-25T18:45:36	This poll suggests young voters may be engaged by Bernie's call for fundamental rewrite of the social contract:

ThePlumLineGS	724637179260076032	2016-04-25T16:32:21	Yup. Must read from fdwilkinson: 
ThePlumLineGS	724637064172580867	2016-04-25T16:31:53	PoliticoScott nickconfessore Great piece but nomination process reform also potentially key to this: 
ThePlumLineGS	724635996499927040	2016-04-25T16:27:39	txoffender I'm fine with him staying in until the end: 
ThePlumLineGS	724631564752171008	2016-04-25T16:10:02	Read paulwaldman1 on how Hillary's new "hugs" ad shows how she'll go after the GOP in the general: 
ThePlumLineGS	724618956380733440	2016-04-25T15:19:56	armandodkos brianbeutler is right -- most of this is tame by 2008 standards: 
ThePlumLineGS	724618509422993409	2016-04-25T15:18:10	armandodkos "I would hope that all of our people would focus on the real issues"
ThePlumLineGS	724618088205934594	2016-04-25T15:16:29	armandodkos borderline. he called on all his supporters to stop these sorts of attacks
ThePlumLineGS	724617703458222080	2016-04-25T15:14:57	armandodkos He did disavow what she said on one of the Sunday shows.
ThePlumLineGS	724617341833732096	2016-04-25T15:13:31	armandodkos also plenty about what Bernie should do, even though you resolutely continue to pretend otherwise.
ThePlumLineGS	724617071456358400	2016-04-25T15:12:27	armandodkos Sure, but this debate is also a rabbit hole I have little interest in going down
ThePlumLineGS	724616177855696896	2016-04-25T15:08:54	armandodkos not sure why I'm responsible for what other people said eight years ago or why that has any bearing on current debate
ThePlumLineGS	724614897456304132	2016-04-25T15:03:48	TVHilton there is no "hostage taking" here. stop with this nonsense already.
ThePlumLineGS	724614528818905088	2016-04-25T15:02:21	armandodkos there is no "special concern." both are responsible.
ThePlumLineGS	724614201814204416	2016-04-25T15:01:03	armandodkos But you agree with that point, right?
ThePlumLineGS	724613840319713281	2016-04-25T14:59:36	armandodkos My argument is that both of them are responsible to some degree for how this ends. You really disagree with that?
ThePlumLineGS	724613654105198597	2016-04-25T14:58:52	armandodkos AntLorenzoGreen then you aren't reading very carefully, or perhaps aren't reading in good faith
ThePlumLineGS	724613413498920962	2016-04-25T14:57:55	AntLorenzoGreen armandodkos You can't possibly have actually read this piece that way.
ThePlumLineGS	724612916431958018	2016-04-25T14:55:56	armandodkos The discussion about what Hillary and Bernie both need to do goes to core of what is good for *her* candidacy.
ThePlumLineGS	724612631533899776	2016-04-25T14:54:48	armandodkos No. He needs to help unite the party behind her.
ThePlumLineGS	724612231346970624	2016-04-25T14:53:13	armandodkos Absurd. It says he should not take it to the convention floor, because that would be "potentially destructive."
ThePlumLineGS	724611555669741568	2016-04-25T14:50:32	armandodkos You mean like this? 
ThePlumLineGS	724610603839590400	2016-04-25T14:46:45	Will conclusion of primaries damage Dems? That's not just up to Bernie. It's also up to Hillary: 
ThePlumLineGS	724607346475958272	2016-04-25T14:33:48	jinyll SilentMars So Sanders is wrong or lying when he says Trump or Cruz would be far worse?
ThePlumLineGS	724606401549615104	2016-04-25T14:30:03	jinyll SilentMars Or maybe Sanders' claims about Cruz or Trump being far worse might end up actually meaning something to his supporters.
ThePlumLineGS	724591178574901249	2016-04-25T13:29:33	philipsturner interesting, thanks
ThePlumLineGS	724588843429683200	2016-04-25T13:20:17	philipsturner what might that look like in specific terms?
ThePlumLineGS	724586375811633153	2016-04-25T13:10:28	ThePlumLineGS Totally. But you get the sense they still don't know how they want to land the plane -- even after NY results
ThePlumLineGS	724586609165918208	2016-04-25T13:11:24	mmurraypolitics yep. will be interesting to see if approach changes after tomorrow
ThePlumLineGS	724586082906570752	2016-04-25T13:09:18	KevinMFeeney eh, I read that more as, "here's what my supporters may want to hear"
ThePlumLineGS	724585939515924480	2016-04-25T13:08:44	mmurraypolitics True. But note that he's moved from "taking it to convention" to "taking it to California"
ThePlumLineGS	724584779719544832	2016-04-25T13:04:08	KevinMFeeney I don't think it will be presented that way
ThePlumLineGS	724582037567488000	2016-04-25T12:53:14	This, from the Sanders campaign, is good.  
ThePlumLineGS	724582185114689537	2016-04-25T12:53:49	scarylawyerguy That's silly. He has every right to try to influence the convention and the platform.
ThePlumLineGS	724579829371310080	2016-04-25T12:44:28	Bernie's vow to take it all the way to the convention appears to be receding into the background: 
ThePlumLineGS	724577864339824641	2016-04-25T12:36:39	WadeChapman15 that's exactly what the piece says, multiple times
ThePlumLineGS	724577228084940801	2016-04-25T12:34:07	Bernie is now plainly ratcheting *down* expectations for how this will end. Here's the key tell:

ThePlumLineGS	723899173305614337	2016-04-23T15:39:46	armandodkos good point

ThePlumLineGS	722755973929115648	2016-04-20T11:57:06	BrentWoodcox okay
ThePlumLineGS	722755661461852160	2016-04-20T11:55:52	MABlumenfeld jpodhoretz True. But the demographics matter too. Dem groups going up; GOP groups going down.

ThePlumLineGS	722154413016670208	2016-04-18T20:06:43	armandodkos it's consistent with pushing for a resolution later that includes reforms

ThePlumLineGS	722138632270802944	2016-04-18T19:04:01	tclark692 it's not a polling average if we don't include all the polls

ThePlumLineGS	722130649214279680	2016-04-18T18:32:17	FrederickPoland DavidKaib Her position is that "we're all good," but only provided we reach universal health care with Ocare 1/2
ThePlumLineGS	722128041334452225	2016-04-18T18:21:56	FrederickPoland DavidKaib Hillary is not saying an expansion of Obamacare will "never" happen. She's saying that about single payer.
ThePlumLineGS	722127811809579008	2016-04-18T18:21:01	PaulHRosenberg Yeah, see, I reject that interpretation of what happened.
ThePlumLineGS	722125123323633665	2016-04-18T18:10:20	DavidKaib My point was it's questionable to hold up SS as example proving that current "incremental" liberalism is relatively insufficient
ThePlumLineGS	722123884120694784	2016-04-18T18:05:25	DavidKaib Social Security was a "huge achievement," but it fell short in its initial incarnation, and had to be expanded later.
ThePlumLineGS	722123623062990853	2016-04-18T18:04:22	PaulHRosenberg Obamacare was also a major achievement, despite requiring further improvement.
ThePlumLineGS	722123192995856384	2016-04-18T18:02:40	DavidKaib So Obamacare wasn't a large leap? Got it.

ThePlumLineGS	722054227133100034	2016-04-18T13:28:37	stevesingiser see the arguments in the link about climate and young people
ThePlumLineGS	722053788866080769	2016-04-18T13:26:53	wccubbison right that's what the piece argues
ThePlumLineGS	722053689809235969	2016-04-18T13:26:29	stevesingiser right -- I think he's keeping his supporters engaged. That's understandable

ThePlumLineGS	722050396290740224	2016-04-18T13:13:24	Bernie has now signaled explicitly that he will take it all the way to convention floor. My take: 
ThePlumLineGS	722028014725394432	2016-04-18T11:44:27	Actually, polarization is also because Republicans such as yourself are overly cavalier with this charge.

ThePlumLineGS	721711999504265216	2016-04-17T14:48:44	armandodkos Sanders should not divide the convention. But I don't see any reason why unity talks shouldn't take place in June. Okay?
ThePlumLineGS	721711554169802752	2016-04-17T14:46:57	armandodkos It's not going to come to that.

ThePlumLineGS	721703827129376768	2016-04-17T14:16:15	armandodkos neeratanden a lot depends on what Sanders actually means by this. Has he explained?

ThePlumLineGS	721471225416060928	2016-04-16T22:51:59	Pachacutec_ I apologized to her. I think you are inclined to think the burden is on Hillary to disprove Sanders's claims.
ThePlumLineGS	721467234695147520	2016-04-16T22:36:07	bmaz emptywheel dooglives heh
ThePlumLineGS	721464391330373632	2016-04-16T22:24:49	Pachacutec_ It's interesting that you see no need to scrutinize anything Sanders is saying here
ThePlumLineGS	721462263014690816	2016-04-16T22:16:22	Pachacutec_ 3) Is Hill right that corrupt system can be reformed from within? Is Sanders right that it *can't* be done by pols who benefit?
ThePlumLineGS	721461825305448448	2016-04-16T22:14:37	Pachacutec_ 1) Is Sanders saying Hillary's policy choices are directly linked to the money she benefits from/earned? 2) If so, is it true?
ThePlumLineGS	721460445635309568	2016-04-16T22:09:08	Pachacutec_ jayrosen_nyu "money shapes policy" is too vague a claim to answer the question at issue here, sorry
ThePlumLineGS	721458851472666624	2016-04-16T22:02:48	Pachacutec_ jayrosen_nyu also, are you saying that any and all public officials who benefit from corporate $ are unduly influenced by it?
ThePlumLineGS	721458497829867520	2016-04-16T22:01:24	Pachacutec_ as opposed to a corruption rationale. explained here: 
ThePlumLineGS	721458340174368768	2016-04-16T22:00:47	Pachacutec_ jayrosen_nyu despite his first sentence, there is an argument for campaign reform based on a political equality rationale
ThePlumLineGS	721413006391959552	2016-04-16T19:00:38	Pachacutec_ emptywheel dooglives fair
ThePlumLineGS	721412888682971138	2016-04-16T19:00:10	JW_DTLA yup. Political equality rationale may be preferable per rickhasen
ThePlumLineGS	721412609573044224	2016-04-16T18:59:03	Apinak either would nominate justice who'd overturn CU. in any case I prefer political equality rationale to corruption rationale
ThePlumLineGS	721411628290482176	2016-04-16T18:55:10	emptywheel dooglives maybe you could see differences on budget deals/entitlements? Open to hearing what other differences would result
ThePlumLineGS	721411297112387584	2016-04-16T18:53:51	emptywheel dooglives agree on FP. I guess I'm skeptical either could accomplish much more w/GOP House than infrastructure and immig reform
ThePlumLineGS	721407966713352192	2016-04-16T18:40:37	leahmcelrath can't DM now will try later or tomorrow
ThePlumLineGS	721406560824651777	2016-04-16T18:35:01	emptywheel I apologize for suggesting your reading was motivated by partisanship
ThePlumLineGS	721405774975655938	2016-04-16T18:31:54	akpak29 probably the former. Yes on health reform, Dodd Frank, global climate deal, Clean Power Plan
ThePlumLineGS	721405090448453633	2016-04-16T18:29:11	emptywheel dooglives Im talking more about how outcomes under either as prez would be similar
ThePlumLineGS	721404691247198209	2016-04-16T18:27:36	akpak29 dooglives emptywheel yes
ThePlumLineGS	721404227357171712	2016-04-16T18:25:45	dooglives emptywheel also based on basic structural constraints. And on fact that Bernie/Hillary  closer to each other than she is to GOP
ThePlumLineGS	721403615395594240	2016-04-16T18:23:19	emptywheel dooglives this is a fair argument. I think it has enormously improved the debate that Sanders has elevated this critique
ThePlumLineGS	721402964460617728	2016-04-16T18:20:44	dooglives emptywheel I don't claim to know what's in her heart. My take is we get similar outcomes with either Hillary or Bernie in WH
ThePlumLineGS	721400429251334144	2016-04-16T18:10:39	dooglives emptywheel well, they differ on core Q of whether one can work within corrupt system to reform it. Legit disagreement.
ThePlumLineGS	721400112623300610	2016-04-16T18:09:24	emptywheel this is why I keep maintaining my reading is reasonable
ThePlumLineGS	721399938744250370	2016-04-16T18:08:43	emptywheel whole exchange = allegation that bought access also bought her position. Add in the ad and his meaning is unmistakable. 2/2
ThePlumLineGS	721399253835390976	2016-04-16T18:05:59	emptywheel I agree $ risks buying increased access which can lead to favorable predisposition. Piece says that 1/2
ThePlumLineGS	721397921426587649	2016-04-16T18:00:42	dooglives SandraHelena39 emptywheel I agree with your last sentence, mostly
ThePlumLineGS	721397052517785600	2016-04-16T17:57:14	dooglives SandraHelena39 emptywheel that's a fair argument. Bernie is going farther.
ThePlumLineGS	721396874687750144	2016-04-16T17:56:32	SandraHelena39 emptywheel right. They give her money because of this. That's reason to vote against her. Doesn't mean positions are bought
ThePlumLineGS	721396156660596737	2016-04-16T17:53:41	emptywheel oh my God. By YOUR reading, the meaning is the money bought favorable disposition that translated into vote/stance banks wanted.
ThePlumLineGS	721394615211921408	2016-04-16T17:47:33	SandraHelena39 emptywheel I agree with this . She is *genuinely* predisposed *by instinct* to be less punitive towards Wall Street
ThePlumLineGS	721394232502718465	2016-04-16T17:46:02	SandraHelena39 that's an overly vague description of the question at issue
ThePlumLineGS	721393609161994240	2016-04-16T17:43:33	emptywheel "decision that shows she favored banks" = a policy stance or vote, "because of the money." Your parsing is strained.
ThePlumLineGS	721391603345133568	2016-04-16T17:35:35	emptywheel Maybe we can also look up "decision" and "because of the money"
ThePlumLineGS	721390073544105984	2016-04-16T17:29:30	emptywheel fine...I think *your* analysis is bad. Now what?
ThePlumLineGS	721389826340229121	2016-04-16T17:28:32	emptywheel again, there aren't word games in the piece. It's a perfectly reasonable use of direct quote, embedded vid and legit summarizing
ThePlumLineGS	721389252450381824	2016-04-16T17:26:15	emptywheel except it doesn't do that.
ThePlumLineGS	721389075274534912	2016-04-16T17:25:32	emptywheel Piece is perfectly reasonable reading of exchange + ad. Your interpretation runs interference for *Sanders's* ongoing word games
ThePlumLineGS	721388380441980930	2016-04-16T17:22:47	emptywheel "Hillary press release" = piece that says Sanders raises legit Qs she should address more directly.
ThePlumLineGS	721388002040287232	2016-04-16T17:21:17	emptywheel FWIW I never used QPQ in the piece, just in the tweet. That might have gone too far.
ThePlumLineGS	721387659877335042	2016-04-16T17:19:55	emptywheel Yeah, okay. And I think you are pretending not to know exactly what Bernie is doing here.
ThePlumLineGS	721386508935163905	2016-04-16T17:15:21	emptywheel lets get to the point. you dont think that exchange + that ad, taken together, = the charge of direct link betw $ and positions?
ThePlumLineGS	721385959510708225	2016-04-16T17:13:10	emptywheel "misquotation" ... except the piece reproduces the whole sentence of her question. You're making it up at this point.
ThePlumLineGS	721384999195381760	2016-04-16T17:09:21	Pachacutec_ jayrosen_nyu that's not a reasonable reading of that piece
ThePlumLineGS	721382704940507138	2016-04-16T17:00:14	Pachacutec_ here's what I've done on that: 
ThePlumLineGS	721380754614272001	2016-04-16T16:52:29	Pachacutec_ well, in my judgment, Bernie made this allegation. That's my reading of that exchange + the ad
ThePlumLineGS	721379918811148288	2016-04-16T16:49:09	Pachacutec_ Bernie made the allegation of a direct link between $ and her positions. He went beyond the broad critique you are offering
ThePlumLineGS	721374719350566912	2016-04-16T16:28:30	Pachacutec_ I absolutely agree with his broader critique of money/influence. Piece says that.
ThePlumLineGS	721374304911417344	2016-04-16T16:26:51	jaytingle I'm asking you to stop pretending Bernie isn't saying what he is actually saying.
ThePlumLineGS	721372519438151681	2016-04-16T16:19:45	jaytingle  just own Bernie's positions already.
ThePlumLineGS	721370079171059712	2016-04-16T16:10:03	emptywheel If you don't see this piece as balanced and a good faith effort to be fair to both sides, we'll have to agree to disagree.
ThePlumLineGS	721368187565170690	2016-04-16T16:02:32	emptywheel Pachacutec_ asked for a "decision" she made "because" of money, Sanders explicitly cited her position on banks + speaking fees.
ThePlumLineGS	721367495744077824	2016-04-16T15:59:48	emptywheel Pachacutec_ I already justified it. You are now running interference for his *explicit claims.*
ThePlumLineGS	721366813192384512	2016-04-16T15:57:05	emptywheel Pachacutec_ what about asking Sanders camp for clarification: what is the nature of the link you see between $ and her stances?
ThePlumLineGS	721366163515654144	2016-04-16T15:54:30	emptywheel Pachacutec_ my reading of the exchange is at least as reasonable as yours is. But here's what I propose. 1/2
ThePlumLineGS	721364645005680640	2016-04-16T15:48:28	emptywheel Pachacutec_ Bash said, name a "decision" she made "because of money received." He supplied her position on banks and cited fees
ThePlumLineGS	721362044025466880	2016-04-16T15:38:08	emptywheel Pachacutec_ Bernie answers, "sure, sure" and then provides the example of not breaking up banks/speaking fees
ThePlumLineGS	721361844825415680	2016-04-16T15:37:20	emptywheel Pachacutec_ Read the exchange where Bash asks for a specific example of a Hillary policy "because of the money she received"
ThePlumLineGS	721360382435065860	2016-04-16T15:31:32	emptywheel Pachacutec_ 2) the ad also says that big banks "get" tax breaks in return for speaking fees
ThePlumLineGS	721360252906569728	2016-04-16T15:31:01	emptywheel Pachacutec_ 1) the ad says that big banks "get" a rigged economy in return for speaking fees.
ThePlumLineGS	721359884545986560	2016-04-16T15:29:33	emptywheel Pachacutec_ Now you're just running interference for him. By contrast, I acknowledge the force of much of his argument.
ThePlumLineGS	721358525792825348	2016-04-16T15:24:09	emptywheel @Pachacutec_Because Bernie SAID THIS. Why won't Bernie supporters own his actual positions?
ThePlumLineGS	721358429063778306	2016-04-16T15:23:46	emptywheel right, the piece acknowledges the force of that latter argument.
ThePlumLineGS	721358076029177856	2016-04-16T15:22:22	emptywheel Pachacutec_ And that's a legitimate criticism. Do you agree that her position on banks is directly linked to speaking fees?
ThePlumLineGS	721357739792818176	2016-04-16T15:21:02	emptywheel Pachacutec_ Thats fair point. But Bernie agreed at debate that Hillary opposes breaking up banks precisely b/c of speaking fees

ThePlumLineGS	721347178745212933	2016-04-16T14:39:04	Pachacutec_ jayrosen_nyu yes -- this is open for dispute. Indeed, Bernie himself has often refrained from treating it as a settled issue.

ThePlumLineGS	721000019059470337	2016-04-15T15:39:34	gl33p Carl Bernstein's is very good. He's sympathetic to her but it's very warts-and-all: 
ThePlumLineGS	720996828079124480	2016-04-15T15:26:53	gl33p You should read a biography about her if you haven't already
ThePlumLineGS	720996590605975553	2016-04-15T15:25:57	.washingtonpost got 988 million page views in March: 
ThePlumLineGS	720995630743687169	2016-04-15T15:22:08	gl33p right -- the uncharitable interpretation is that he believes she is corrupt but won't say so b/c it might compromise his image
ThePlumLineGS	720993786642436097	2016-04-15T15:14:48	gl33p Hah. Point is, Bernie proably suspects many D voters won't believe it. That's why he refrained from saying it directly
ThePlumLineGS	720993395003559936	2016-04-15T15:13:15	gl33p Even Bernie refrained from making that claim for many months
ThePlumLineGS	720992673302188033	2016-04-15T15:10:23	gl33p and so, they accept her argument that she can work within corrupt system to reform it 2/2
ThePlumLineGS	720992579383377920	2016-04-15T15:10:00	gl33p I think that Dem voters agree that money in politics has corrupting potential but don't necessarily think she's been corrupted 1/2
ThePlumLineGS	720992038448197632	2016-04-15T15:07:52	Frankie78209 no prob
ThePlumLineGS	720991764270747648	2016-04-15T15:06:46	gl33p Apparently they do, since they are voting for her.
ThePlumLineGS	720990827179286528	2016-04-15T15:03:03	Frankie78209 I'm not a Hillary surrogate. Have written many pieces criticizing her.
ThePlumLineGS	720990056991846400	2016-04-15T14:59:59	MarshallLocke equally remarkable that Bernie Sanders doesn't think it's an issue.

ThePlumLineGS	720988869269852161	2016-04-15T14:55:16	Bottom line on the debate: Dem voters are unlikely to believe the very worst about Hillary: 
ThePlumLineGS	720982988109037568	2016-04-15T14:31:54	HookLib definitely agree. he makes the broader case better
ThePlumLineGS	720982266051170304	2016-04-15T14:29:02	HookLib yeah except he explicitly cited the Goldman speaking fees. Also made it explicit at debate last night
ThePlumLineGS	720976571666931713	2016-04-15T14:06:24	HookLib yes -- he really struggles when it becomes about her specifically. This problem has been obvious for months
ThePlumLineGS	720975875165011969	2016-04-15T14:03:38	HookLib I would also add that there is a political equality argument for reform, beyond the corruption argument ggreenwald
ThePlumLineGS	720975561355616260	2016-04-15T14:02:23	HookLib I dealt with that in the piece; I don't necessarily think that follows, though I respect ggreenwald's argument
ThePlumLineGS	720972284970799104	2016-04-15T13:49:22	baseballcrank Clinton favors preserving/building on Dodd Frank. Rs would repeal it. Is their position directly shaped by corporate $$?
ThePlumLineGS	720971353793433600	2016-04-15T13:45:40	DavidMDrucker yeah I think so. I don't think they view the argument over big money in the terms Sanders does
ThePlumLineGS	720970500692910081	2016-04-15T13:42:17	mmurraypolitics Exactly. Sanders explicitly says Obama-era change fell well short
ThePlumLineGS	720970335403786240	2016-04-15T13:41:37	baseballcrank They don't believe Bernie's argument that her policy positions are directly shaped by Wall St money.
ThePlumLineGS	720969843755888640	2016-04-15T13:39:40	Hillary says she can work within corrupt system to reform it. Bernie simply doesn't believe this is possible: 
ThePlumLineGS	720967264548364289	2016-04-15T13:29:25	Bernie goes there: Hillary is hopelessly captive to our corrupt system. But Dem voters might not believe it:

ThePlumLineGS	720946009732485120	2016-04-15T12:04:57	IFThunder overly simplistic and not particularly interesting
ThePlumLineGS	720945029813051393	2016-04-15T12:01:04	IDreamOnDemand it says that explicitly, numerous times
ThePlumLineGS	720944287689678848	2016-04-15T11:58:07	IDreamOnDemand also discussed in the piece
ThePlumLineGS	720944136594026496	2016-04-15T11:57:31	IDreamOnDemand yes, all of that is discussed extensively in the piece.

ThePlumLineGS	720928190257106944	2016-04-15T10:54:09	Yep. The rancor is very real. But here's one way it might end up being resolved:  
ThePlumLineGS	720924311519903744	2016-04-15T10:38:44	Giving GOP nomination to anyone other than Donald Trump would be an illegitimate outcome, says Donald Trump:

ThePlumLineGS	720809198871842816	2016-04-15T03:01:19	NorwoodJenn I'm simply pointing out that Sanders should not be dismissing the importance of her southern wins

ThePlumLineGS	720808272442322944	2016-04-15T02:57:38	7im yeah that too
ThePlumLineGS	720808216754589696	2016-04-15T02:57:25	contrariancont she won in the south partly because of African Americans
ThePlumLineGS	720807917717450754	2016-04-15T02:56:14	Hillary's wins in the south also included VA, FL, and NC, all of which are kind of important in the general election.
ThePlumLineGS	720805837997019137	2016-04-15T02:47:58	Folks, Bernie has previously said he would ask Obama to withdraw Garland nomination:  
ThePlumLineGS	720804422536851457	2016-04-15T02:42:20	JRTomlinAuthor It was a dumb response. And yeah, bye.
ThePlumLineGS	720803841592201216	2016-04-15T02:40:02	JRTomlinAuthor Another criticism, without having read my stuff. I wouldn't feel comfortable doing that, but that's just me.
ThePlumLineGS	720803605100503040	2016-04-15T02:39:05	JRTomlinAuthor Then you would be wrong. Which you'd know if you read my stuff on this primary before popping off (crazy request, I know).
ThePlumLineGS	720802996834197504	2016-04-15T02:36:40	JRTomlinAuthor "shifting the boundaries of legitimate debate" is a criticism in your view?
ThePlumLineGS	720799190306201600	2016-04-15T02:21:33	Bernie saying Israel's military responses are "disproportionate" is an example of him trying to shift boundaries of legitimate debate
ThePlumLineGS	720797669954883584	2016-04-15T02:15:30	kullfarr Even if that's true, he was still overly dismissive of it.
ThePlumLineGS	720797186481602560	2016-04-15T02:13:35	Bernie:  "I know you keep referring to Barack Obama all night here"
ThePlumLineGS	720797069900980224	2016-04-15T02:13:07	kullfarr The fact that the deal does not *guarantee* success does not mean it is not a major accomplishment.
ThePlumLineGS	720795297958510593	2016-04-15T02:06:05	kullfarr of course. the deal builds in a framework to ratchet up the goals.
ThePlumLineGS	720793582307844096	2016-04-15T01:59:16	Bernie says "of course" the global climate deal is a "step forward."  I'd say it's a little bit more than that.

ThePlumLineGS	720789963999223808	2016-04-15T01:44:53	When it comes to his own votes, Bernie makes a persuasive case that decisions on major legislation are complex and morally ambiguous.
ThePlumLineGS	720787622227021825	2016-04-15T01:35:35	amysalv yeah -- she already supported a national minimum of $12 and a $15 minimum in some areas
ThePlumLineGS	720787253287587840	2016-04-15T01:34:07	Yup. And I think Sanders can justifiably take some credit for this: 
ThePlumLineGS	720785491822559233	2016-04-15T01:27:07	Folks, let's not be children here. No matter WHAT is in the super secret speech transcripts, releasing them = cave + weakness.
ThePlumLineGS	720784600738459648	2016-04-15T01:23:35	Area people pretending to be too naive to know that the demand to release speech transcripts is designed *not* to be met.
ThePlumLineGS	720783703992086528	2016-04-15T01:20:01	froomkin yes, but also a battle over whether Sanders's assessment of the Obama era is reasonable
ThePlumLineGS	720782671136321536	2016-04-15T01:15:54	The dispute you're hearing right now between Bernie and Hillary, summed up:  
ThePlumLineGS	720781939251261440	2016-04-15T01:13:00	petersuderman Yep, true. Sanders has to be careful not to be too direct about Obama
ThePlumLineGS	720781550414131201	2016-04-15T01:11:27	petersuderman They're even explicit critiques. Sanders says Obama-era change fell well short b/c of continued D dependence on $$$
ThePlumLineGS	720780562814935040	2016-04-15T01:07:32	Gonna say this again: Sanders's argument for nine months has been that *no one* in thrall to plutocratic $$$ can solve our problems.
ThePlumLineGS	720778996502245376	2016-04-15T01:01:18	I'll repeat again: You fecking millennial women don't know what Hillary did for our rights to wear pants suits. She still dresses well.

ThePlumLineGS	720259137171537920	2016-04-13T14:35:34	rossaaaanderson ryanlcooper I've questioned Hillary camp's approach to his supporters. But they'll fix it.
ThePlumLineGS	720258648413306880	2016-04-13T14:33:38	rossaaaanderson ryanlcooper they'll bend over backwards to win Sanders' supporters, you'll see
ThePlumLineGS	720258124867706880	2016-04-13T14:31:33	rossaaaanderson ryanlcooper well, I think concessions should be made to him. have said so repeatedly
ThePlumLineGS	720257717470932992	2016-04-13T14:29:56	rossaaaanderson ryanlcooper That's fine. Whole piece argues he can/should wait as long as possible.
ThePlumLineGS	720257270861279234	2016-04-13T14:28:09	rossaaaanderson ryanlcooper If Clinton wins nom, Bernie will rightly say we must elect her for good of planet. And *then* you'll nod along
ThePlumLineGS	720256796636680192	2016-04-13T14:26:16	rossaaaanderson ryanlcooper weird I guess I take Sanders's claim that climate change is threat to planet seriously

ThePlumLineGS	720255463732850691	2016-04-13T14:20:58	hey_itsthatguy well, I generally agree he went too far but he now seems to be dialing it down

ThePlumLineGS	720254706568835073	2016-04-13T14:17:58	dooglives There is no convincing way to measure this. It's an argument I'm just not really interested in having.
ThePlumLineGS	720254505170771969	2016-04-13T14:17:10	armandodkos Real_Food yeah I think that's a fair post-April 26th standard
ThePlumLineGS	720254336157229057	2016-04-13T14:16:30	Real_Food armandodkos I think so, yeah
ThePlumLineGS	720254243471372288	2016-04-13T14:16:07	dooglives here, why don't you read this instead 
ThePlumLineGS	720254135329808384	2016-04-13T14:15:42	dooglives Sanders supporters do engage in same tactics Clinton supporters do. If you don't want to admit this, I'll move on.
ThePlumLineGS	720253187932880896	2016-04-13T14:11:56	armandodkos well, exactly. they'll be registering support for his message, as I tried to argue
ThePlumLineGS	720253049592287232	2016-04-13T14:11:23	dooglives no argument could dissuade you from the idea that your political impulses are purer and more noble than those of HRC backers
ThePlumLineGS	720252776203333632	2016-04-13T14:10:18	Hesiod2k11 will do
ThePlumLineGS	720252188463861760	2016-04-13T14:07:58	Hesiod2k11 I assume he'll temper message a bit after April 26
ThePlumLineGS	720251919164448768	2016-04-13T14:06:53	Hesiod2k11 if people want to send money in support of his basic underlying idea, that's fine
ThePlumLineGS	720251437754679296	2016-04-13T14:04:59	armandodkos at that point he should temper his message, I would agree
ThePlumLineGS	720251146074529792	2016-04-13T14:03:49	Hesiod2k11 I tried to make that case in the piece, but maybe I wasn't persuasive
ThePlumLineGS	720251054038913024	2016-04-13T14:03:27	armandodkos no, it says that it's fine for him to argue that now. And then qualified in the following graf
ThePlumLineGS	720250877622239233	2016-04-13T14:02:45	Hesiod2k11 meh, disagree, for reasons outlined in post
ThePlumLineGS	720250772139700224	2016-04-13T14:02:20	armandodkos let's see what he says after April 26. Then I might agree with you.
ThePlumLineGS	720250401367396352	2016-04-13T14:00:51	dooglives oh, nonsense.
ThePlumLineGS	720250324796084224	2016-04-13T14:00:33	armandodkos I thought I tried to answer that Q, but I guess I wasn't persuasive
ThePlumLineGS	720250067618279424	2016-04-13T13:59:32	SandraHelena39 are you seriously pretending that Sanders backers don't also engage in this?
ThePlumLineGS	720249864605548544	2016-04-13T13:58:43	dooglives actually, in this case, they do, unless you want to pretend that somehow you are part of a superior class of people
ThePlumLineGS	720249677615144960	2016-04-13T13:57:59	thomascbowen I thought I tried to answer that Q in the post, but maybe I failed to be persuasive
ThePlumLineGS	720249537009463298	2016-04-13T13:57:25	TheLoki47 I guess my piece didn't persuade you, then

ThePlumLineGS	720219453703725056	2016-04-13T11:57:53	ggreenwald Yeah, it's ugly
ThePlumLineGS	720219130830438400	2016-04-13T11:56:36	AntLorenzoGreen davidplouffe right...that's in the piece

ThePlumLineGS	719858522423443457	2016-04-12T12:03:40	What Democrats have to say on the matter might also be relevant:  
ThePlumLineGS	719858184106561536	2016-04-12T12:02:20	JoeTrippi certainly possible
ThePlumLineGS	719856946493440000	2016-04-12T11:57:24	Similar intra-party recriminations possible on Dem side:  
ThePlumLineGS	719855735920836609	2016-04-12T11:52:36	JoeTrippi but there are plainly problems with the process that need examination, no?
ThePlumLineGS	719854251174969344	2016-04-12T11:46:42	JoeTrippi Right, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't look at the flaws in the process, does it?

ThePlumLineGS	719616847327453184	2016-04-11T20:03:20	PCalith armandodkos I understand that view. There are other problems with open primaries, too
ThePlumLineGS	719616754327121920	2016-04-11T20:02:58	armandodkos I'm not saying they will

ThePlumLineGS	719616294526590980	2016-04-11T20:01:09	armandodkos that is possible. I'm just floating some ideas as to what might be discussed or attempted
ThePlumLineGS	719616190847561730	2016-04-11T20:00:44	allanbrauer right, I've debunked it, too 
ThePlumLineGS	719615687749169153	2016-04-11T19:58:44	SilentMars KevinSoup100 I think you've lost the plot
ThePlumLineGS	719615412833554432	2016-04-11T19:57:38	allanbrauer he isn't calling for that.
ThePlumLineGS	719615317241159680	2016-04-11T19:57:16	armandodkos I'm torn. Not crazy with how this is playing out in NY.

ThePlumLineGS	719614074644996096	2016-04-11T19:52:19	Mypes45 well, that would certainly represent reform!
ThePlumLineGS	719613953123479552	2016-04-11T19:51:50	KevinSoup100 but the super delegates did not throw the nomination to the person with *fewer* pledged dels

ThePlumLineGS	719611381780189184	2016-04-11T19:41:37	matt_didato dunno, all of this might be debated. this is not an official reform blueprint
ThePlumLineGS	719611241778569216	2016-04-11T19:41:04	PtolemysWrath irenelegal not a matter of a non-D "demanding" anything. A lot of Bernie supporters are Dems
ThePlumLineGS	719611069304545280	2016-04-11T19:40:23	GidiTaff that's the nuance. as part of a broader package of reforms, maybe
ThePlumLineGS	719610939243421696	2016-04-11T19:39:52	matt_didato all the reasons are spelled out in the piece
ThePlumLineGS	719606869266792448	2016-04-11T19:23:41	ThePlumLineGS That should open them up while also minimizing ratf*cking. but yes, kill off caucuses, period.
ThePlumLineGS	719606109439467524	2016-04-11T19:20:40	If Sanders takes this to convention, he might push for reforms to Dem nominating process. A few ideas:

ThePlumLineGS	719557853946712064	2016-04-11T16:08:55	mmurraypolitics worth noting that Sanders camp says he'll try to flip super dels even if he trails in pop vote *and* pledged dels
ThePlumLineGS	719542071045066752	2016-04-11T15:06:12	Don't ever let it be said that Trump doesn't stand up for persecuted minorities:  
ThePlumLineGS	719539877717680128	2016-04-11T14:57:29	MattBruenig PhilPerspective Gotcha. Looks to me like we're in for stalemate (with some exceptions) until the 2020s, if either D wins
ThePlumLineGS	719539586888822786	2016-04-11T14:56:20	MattBruenig PhilPerspective I'm not saying otherwise
ThePlumLineGS	719538824095932416	2016-04-11T14:53:18	PhilPerspective MattBruenig I'm generally skeptical opposition would break, but I think there could be some targeted compromising
ThePlumLineGS	719538598069071872	2016-04-11T14:52:24	PhilPerspective MattBruenig Not really. The Q is, if they lose again, do they decide they want to only be Congressional party from now on
ThePlumLineGS	719533869054193664	2016-04-11T14:33:37	ZaidJilani MattBruenig definitely
ThePlumLineGS	719533442518683649	2016-04-11T14:31:55	MattBruenig if they suffer historic losses three straight times among Latinos at some point those who actually want reform will force issue
ThePlumLineGS	719533287925030912	2016-04-11T14:31:18	MattBruenig Yeah, I'm skeptical of that. I do think that with Ryan as speaker there's a marginally better chance on immigration 1/2
ThePlumLineGS	719532872554651648	2016-04-11T14:29:39	MattBruenig that's true. I think she should be pressed to say with more specificity how she would get stuff done (and he should too)
ThePlumLineGS	719531501466083328	2016-04-11T14:24:12	MattBruenig FWIW, some of us have argued that Hillary also probably can't get much done b/c of GOP Congress

ThePlumLineGS	719522809916059649	2016-04-11T13:49:40	amk44139 nah, only helps Trump w/GOP primary voters if Hillary attacks him
ThePlumLineGS	719521271587946496	2016-04-11T13:43:33	smenor If she wins, I expect Bernie will play big role in trying to change this

ThePlumLineGS	719514617664389120	2016-04-11T13:17:07	In a subtle way, it also asks Dem NY voters to consider who would  be "tough enough to stop Trump."

ThePlumLineGS	718829578094047233	2016-04-09T15:55:01	karlhenning it is still highly unlikely, and other news orgs have their own current counts not much higher than Sanders camp does

ThePlumLineGS	718106416221921281	2016-04-07T16:01:26	daddy18880 I'm sure she is, but he's unlikely to win the nomination
ThePlumLineGS	718105574483877888	2016-04-07T15:58:05	Here philipaklein says Bernie's "unqualified" line will be used in GOP ads against Hillary. There's precedent: 
ThePlumLineGS	718104462620037120	2016-04-07T15:53:40	DouthatNYT geoffgarin Hillary is deeply flawed, but she may be seen as preferable to Ted "make the sand glow" Cruz
ThePlumLineGS	718103943688101890	2016-04-07T15:51:36	DouthatNYT Coincidentally, "steady hand" is exactly the phrase geoffgarin uses to describe Hillary-Cruz contrast
ThePlumLineGS	718102069639581697	2016-04-07T15:44:09	politicswthsoul possibly, but probably worse down ticket than Cruz
ThePlumLineGS	718101425201487876	2016-04-07T15:41:36	blucaller I wrote about it this AM, including what Hillary really said
ThePlumLineGS	718101295069077505	2016-04-07T15:41:05	StephenWHudson1 I suppose. Seems to me like that was subset of claiming she's captive to plutocracy
ThePlumLineGS	718100729471361024	2016-04-07T15:38:50	daaitoulaam It says, "he hasn't gotten much done." This is now out of bounds?
ThePlumLineGS	718100247247978497	2016-04-07T15:36:55	Good case that Cruz would be nearly as bad as Trump here from jonathanchait. Top Ds agree:  
ThePlumLineGS	718100013860171777	2016-04-07T15:35:59	jonathanchait True! Also, Priorities USA's pollster laid out a whole case to that effect, too: 
ThePlumLineGS	718099092493176832	2016-04-07T15:32:19	daaitoulaam this tweet says nothing of the kind.
ThePlumLineGS	718098990701658112	2016-04-07T15:31:55	StephenWHudson1 you think her ideology is disqualifying? That isn't really what Sanders said, though
ThePlumLineGS	718097723858223104	2016-04-07T15:26:53	StephenWHudson1 well, I'm arguing this is the logical extension of the argument Sanders has made for nine months 
ThePlumLineGS	718096869470154757	2016-04-07T15:23:29	StephenWHudson1 who the hell cares
ThePlumLineGS	718096071466082304	2016-04-07T15:20:19	NickRiccardi probably not
ThePlumLineGS	718096004151656449	2016-04-07T15:20:03	stuart_zechman I did a whole thing about this this AM
ThePlumLineGS	718095347025838081	2016-04-07T15:17:26	This flap over "unqualified" is really scraping the bottom of stupid at this point.
ThePlumLineGS	718069440278110210	2016-04-07T13:34:30	Nice ThePlumLineGS piece on the path to the "unqualified" flap. 
ThePlumLineGS	718090089004404736	2016-04-07T14:56:33	daaitoulaam examples?
ThePlumLineGS	718087985271537668	2016-04-07T14:48:11	daaitoulaam emptywheel Can you cite the quote in which she says that? (Seriously.)
ThePlumLineGS	718087788709679105	2016-04-07T14:47:24	emptywheel Sure.
ThePlumLineGS	718087579346845698	2016-04-07T14:46:34	emptywheel I'm not "demanding" anything. I'm trying to be responsive to your criticism.
ThePlumLineGS	718087150563160064	2016-04-07T14:44:52	emptywheel I really wish you would be a bit clearer on what your objection is
ThePlumLineGS	718086612412997632	2016-04-07T14:42:44	kayaker007 I guess you must have missed this post from yesterday, then: 
ThePlumLineGS	718086331142955008	2016-04-07T14:41:37	emptywheel Not sure what that's supposed to mean, but I've done a number of posts questioning Hillary on policy
ThePlumLineGS	718085569188859904	2016-04-07T14:38:35	emptywheel Okay. Can you define "wonk policing" then?
ThePlumLineGS	718085153025826818	2016-04-07T14:36:56	kayaker007 Sorry, I'll never quote Bernie's actual words again.
ThePlumLineGS	718084990811115520	2016-04-07T14:36:17	emptywheel I would just add that I've repeatedly said over the months that describing Bernie's ideas as "unrealistic" misses the big point
ThePlumLineGS	718084822686703617	2016-04-07T14:35:37	emptywheel Okay. Please explain.
ThePlumLineGS	718084768697618433	2016-04-07T14:35:24	SybilT2 ryanlcooper it'll be fine
ThePlumLineGS	718084529550962690	2016-04-07T14:34:27	emptywheel you're saying the "wonk police" are declaring that they get to decide the acceptable boundaries of the policy debate, right?
ThePlumLineGS	718084227800104962	2016-04-07T14:33:15	emptywheel I'm aware of it, I just don't accept your interpretation of it. But if you want to convince me otherwise, I'm open to that
ThePlumLineGS	718083978616520704	2016-04-07T14:32:16	emptywheel I just don't see the "wonk policing" in this light. It's a disagreement, not a claim that only one side's claims are legitimate
ThePlumLineGS	718083381028864000	2016-04-07T14:29:54	emptywheel What quote in particular from Hillary or her supporters do you object to? Just point to it.
ThePlumLineGS	718071628689702914	2016-04-07T13:43:12	I think ThePlumLineGS is right that this fight is mostly just a lot of hot air  
ThePlumLineGS	718083052333883393	2016-04-07T14:28:35	emptywheel she says he doesn't grasp the nuances of policy. right or wrong that's a degree short of "unqualified"
ThePlumLineGS	718082885350264832	2016-04-07T14:27:55	OccupyFortWorth Point to the quote where she described him as unqualified.
ThePlumLineGS	718082515492343808	2016-04-07T14:26:27	emptywheel Hillary does not say Bernie is unqualified; she says his ideas are unrealistic.
ThePlumLineGS	718082116563693568	2016-04-07T14:24:52	emptywheel Another reax from a prominent Bernie supporter ^google|twcamp^serp|twgr^tweet
ThePlumLineGS	718081641592328196	2016-04-07T14:22:59	emptywheel In what sense is this an unfair characterization of Bernie's broader argument?
ThePlumLineGS	718081308593950721	2016-04-07T14:21:39	emptywheel I'm not sure why I'm responsible for that. I've defended Bernie on a number of occasions
ThePlumLineGS	718081025826562048	2016-04-07T14:20:32	grilodan mmurraypolitics Mark is saying that Sanders *both* criticizes *and* praises Obama
ThePlumLineGS	718080762029932545	2016-04-07T14:19:29	emptywheel out of hand on both sides, I'd say
ThePlumLineGS	718080606823911424	2016-04-07T14:18:52	emptywheel If anything, this piece is sympathetic to Bernie's argument. Come on. This sensitivity is getting out of hand.
ThePlumLineGS	718080284793683972	2016-04-07T14:17:35	emptywheel Doing the same in what sense?
ThePlumLineGS	718079703899369472	2016-04-07T14:15:17	emptywheel Let's back up. What's your problem with my piece? (A number of Bernie backers have tweeted it approvingly, BTW.)
ThePlumLineGS	718079391679426561	2016-04-07T14:14:02	emptywheel Fine, but it is not INHERENTLY out of bounds or illegitimate.
ThePlumLineGS	718079059616509953	2016-04-07T14:12:43	emptywheel This "wonk policing" is simply *argument.* I'm not endorsing their view, just saying it's not inherently out of bounds
ThePlumLineGS	718078783522279424	2016-04-07T14:11:37	mpmt3102 Who called on Bernie to apologize for Sandy Hook?
ThePlumLineGS	718078613468393472	2016-04-07T14:10:57	emptywheel I'm skeptical of this idea that "wonk policing" is inherently illegitimate. It seems like the policy argument we want to have
ThePlumLineGS	718078143991570432	2016-04-07T14:09:05	If this disqualifies Hillary, it also disqualified Obama. And that's basically the point Sanders is making: 
ThePlumLineGS	718077362588499969	2016-04-07T14:05:59	emptywheel well, they keep saying it's a response to Hillary's supposed claim that he's unqualified...
ThePlumLineGS	718077165775020032	2016-04-07T14:05:12	mpmt3102 you seem to be deeply confused about who said what in this battle.
ThePlumLineGS	718074427607527424	2016-04-07T13:54:19	Bernie has been basically calling Hillary unqualified for the presidency for nine months: 
ThePlumLineGS	718073304834306048	2016-04-07T13:49:51	mpmt3102 wait, people actually voted for her?
ThePlumLineGS	718071914749624321	2016-04-07T13:44:20	TPG9999 well, sure -- I think he'll find a way out of it, though
ThePlumLineGS	718070898197192705	2016-04-07T13:40:17	ThusBloggedA KevinMKruse the piece actually talks about the Post headline
ThePlumLineGS	718070265134129152	2016-04-07T13:37:46	Bernie's claim that Hillary is not "qualified" perfectly captures core tension of his whole argument: 
ThePlumLineGS	718068290657058816	2016-04-07T13:29:56	.ThePlumLineGS gets this right. And now the media is screaming “FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! ”  
ThePlumLineGS	718068600209326080	2016-04-07T13:31:10	borosage Well, my point is that Bernie doesn't believe that anyone who participates in the corrupt system can get the job done.
ThePlumLineGS	718067994207895553	2016-04-07T13:28:45	NoPublicDuty that must also be why she leads him by so much in the popular vote
ThePlumLineGS	718067305473785857	2016-04-07T13:26:01	Going nuclear: Bernie's claim that Hillary is unqualified is logical extension of his whole candidacy:

ThePlumLineGS	718030851972415489	2016-04-07T11:01:10	graygoods yeah, I mean, there's something to that, but I also think Sanders downplays importance of real obstacles to change

ThePlumLineGS	717846572889939968	2016-04-06T22:48:54	MadeleineGSLAK go read the passage in the book and tell me it wasn't an apology
ThePlumLineGS	717846450915381248	2016-04-06T22:48:25	MadeleineGSLAK look, I'm all for scrutinizing her on policy. And her hawkishness is definitely cause for serious concern.
ThePlumLineGS	717845145731858432	2016-04-06T22:43:14	MadeleineGSLAK oh, come on. this is a semantic game.
ThePlumLineGS	717845047568437249	2016-04-06T22:42:50	MadeleineGSLAK I think we should focus on the policy. She was wrong. Bernie was right.
ThePlumLineGS	717844538254032896	2016-04-06T22:40:49	Very interesting data point ---&gt; 
ThePlumLineGS	717844428103266304	2016-04-06T22:40:23	whatstherukkus Okay, that's fine. I'm just saying it's wrong to say she didn't apologize, even if her apology was insufficient (it was)
ThePlumLineGS	717844255557951488	2016-04-06T22:39:42	Alexand3rTheMeh If I didn't know any better, I'd conclude you don't actually *want* it to be true that she apologized. Strange, but okay.
ThePlumLineGS	717843724303273984	2016-04-06T22:37:35	whatstherukkus Ah, I didn't realize we were on to motive. I thought we were just talking facts.
ThePlumLineGS	717843584687480833	2016-04-06T22:37:02	MadeleineGSLAK the book uses the word "regret." go ahead and spin that away.
ThePlumLineGS	717843432266444801	2016-04-06T22:36:25	whatstherukkus I sort of agree with that. I think she's played it too cute by half in many ways. But not fair to say she didn't apologize
ThePlumLineGS	717841063956914176	2016-04-06T22:27:01	whatstherukkus Is the word "regret" good enough, or are we supposed to play along with your disingenuous game?
ThePlumLineGS	717840952094822401	2016-04-06T22:26:34	YeaYouRite epmurph AM_ProHuman I don't doubt that he was *also* talking about Iraqi victims. And he's right to do that.
ThePlumLineGS	717840528264577024	2016-04-06T22:24:53	I apologize for tweeting a link to a Hillary quote in hopes of adding facts to the discussion. I'll never let it happen again.
ThePlumLineGS	717840179747270658	2016-04-06T22:23:30	YeaYouRite epmurph AM_ProHuman Maybe, but we don't have his direct quote. Even so, he's also talking about Americans, no?
ThePlumLineGS	717839785134538753	2016-04-06T22:21:56	epmurph AM_ProHuman So Bernie wasn't talking about Americans? Have you verified that?
ThePlumLineGS	717838753864290308	2016-04-06T22:17:50	Alexand3rTheMeh the book uses the term "regret"
ThePlumLineGS	717837811077005312	2016-04-06T22:14:05	IanCeraolo Sure. See my last tweet.
ThePlumLineGS	717836885574479873	2016-04-06T22:10:24	YeaYouRite True. And she apologized too late. And her rationale for the initial vote was dodgy.
ThePlumLineGS	717836619579990016	2016-04-06T22:09:21	ThePlumLineGS this is not quite a direct apology to the victims, but fair enough... 
ThePlumLineGS	717836207439347712	2016-04-06T22:07:43	YeaYouRite yes, it's in the link
ThePlumLineGS	717835940723613696	2016-04-06T22:06:39	Actually, the passage in the book includes a direct reference to how her mistake impacted victims' families. 
ThePlumLineGS	717834857997533184	2016-04-06T22:02:21	RebeccaShabad yep, good point!

ThePlumLineGS	717828064059777024	2016-04-06T21:35:21	Ivy_B NPR hah not surprised
ThePlumLineGS	717821101431242752	2016-04-06T21:07:41	PaulSchmehl let's take this off twitter, if you wanna keep this going by email, I'm game
ThePlumLineGS	717820917582315520	2016-04-06T21:06:57	Great idea: Drive a lot of headlines with national Dem poll that includes indys, right before final string of mostly closed primaries.
ThePlumLineGS	717820652212920320	2016-04-06T21:05:54	PaulSchmehl It's not a question of "belief." The facts of the proposals are readily available.
ThePlumLineGS	717820377494384641	2016-04-06T21:04:49	PaulSchmehl Not really. They are voting for proposals which, while very liberal, are not "communist" in any meaningful sense.
ThePlumLineGS	717819891940724737	2016-04-06T21:02:53	PaulSchmehl That's hard to say. But he is very unlikely to win the nomination in any case
ThePlumLineGS	717819465140944897	2016-04-06T21:01:11	PaulSchmehl The red baiting consists in your description of the mainstream Dem agenda as "communism," which is itself an extreme position.
ThePlumLineGS	717818953645629442	2016-04-06T20:59:09	PaulSchmehl Ignoring your red baiting for the moment, Dems/progressives don't own the constitution either, and they should not claim to.
ThePlumLineGS	717818718458351616	2016-04-06T20:58:13	PaulSchmehl I'm saying, what's your alternative to judicial review?
ThePlumLineGS	717818164583776256	2016-04-06T20:56:01	PaulSchmehl What's your alternative?
ThePlumLineGS	717818107834851329	2016-04-06T20:55:47	PaulSchmehl No, actually, it's not. It wasn't even simple for the people who framed and ratified it.
ThePlumLineGS	717817979048738816	2016-04-06T20:55:17	PaulSchmehl No "worship." Just deference/acceptance, because it's the best possible option, at least that I'm aware of.
ThePlumLineGS	717817668418609152	2016-04-06T20:54:03	PaulSchmehl Okay, then, so you want to junk judicial review. Now what do you propose to do?
ThePlumLineGS	717817495504232449	2016-04-06T20:53:21	PaulSchmehl Yes, I struggle with reading, as do generations of SCOTUS justices who have upheld my views, and not yours.
ThePlumLineGS	717817253723504642	2016-04-06T20:52:24	PaulSchmehl Fortunately, the courts have mostly declined to read the Constitution Ted Cruz's way, which is what matters.
ThePlumLineGS	717817017756217344	2016-04-06T20:51:28	PaulSchmehl Right, because claiming you own the Constitution and the meaning of the founding makes it true. Poof! Magic!
ThePlumLineGS	717816505157689344	2016-04-06T20:49:25	PaulSchmehl you mean, your idealized version of the founding fathers
ThePlumLineGS	717814550079389698	2016-04-06T20:41:39	stuartpstevens no, my bad, I botched it in the tweet

ThePlumLineGS	717809421397700608	2016-04-06T20:21:16	sethdmichaels DLind truth
ThePlumLineGS	717808218488107012	2016-04-06T20:16:30	.DLind makes a point that eludes a lot of people: Trump actually has real immigration policies: 
ThePlumLineGS	717806445119606784	2016-04-06T20:09:27	Red4Liberty Ah. My apologies then.
ThePlumLineGS	717806079791513600	2016-04-06T20:08:00	SethAMandel The odd thing about that is the demographics will continue going in the other direction...
ThePlumLineGS	717803733900374016	2016-04-06T19:58:40	Some legit lines of attack on Cruz here. One thing people should remember...Cruz gets a turn at bat against Hillary. 
ThePlumLineGS	717805742280065024	2016-04-06T20:06:39	SethAMandel you mean nominees keep moving rightward?
ThePlumLineGS	717805605805826050	2016-04-06T20:06:07	JimPethokoukis SethAMandel Dammit. The internet never forgets.
ThePlumLineGS	717805406391771137	2016-04-06T20:05:19	SethAMandel trend will continue in what sense?
ThePlumLineGS	717804796854595584	2016-04-06T20:02:54	Red4Liberty It's just a tiresome delusion that only conservatives "adhere to the Constitution."
ThePlumLineGS	717803417134055424	2016-04-06T19:57:25	justturnright pretty good case against Cruz, though
ThePlumLineGS	717803044948283396	2016-04-06T19:55:56	SethAMandel Yeah, I agree. Rubio's quite conservative, but his heart is not in social and constitutional conservatism the way Cruz's is
ThePlumLineGS	717802536300855296	2016-04-06T19:53:55	CharlemagSteak Sanders is very unlikely to win the nomination, as much as Rs hope otherwise
ThePlumLineGS	717802293207416832	2016-04-06T19:52:57	hughhewitt good to hear, thanks
ThePlumLineGS	717802039854645248	2016-04-06T19:51:57	SethAMandel my bad. it's accurate in the story, luckily!
ThePlumLineGS	717801842906906624	2016-04-06T19:51:10	SethAMandel sorry, the quote should be "MODERN American history"
ThePlumLineGS	717801706944405509	2016-04-06T19:50:37	DrewMTips well I think they see some key differences between the two. see on the econ, for instance
ThePlumLineGS	717801534889857024	2016-04-06T19:49:56	CharlemagSteak funny thing is your delusion to this effect will lead you right into the delusion that only a True Conservative can win
ThePlumLineGS	717801200733782016	2016-04-06T19:48:37	SethAMandel he makes the case at length in the link
ThePlumLineGS	717800970865020929	2016-04-06T19:47:42	madlaw1071 general election polls this far out mean almost nothing, and that isn't even true anyway: 
ThePlumLineGS	717800173037043712	2016-04-06T19:44:31	DanaPerino DrewMTips Heh. I mean, they'd say it about any R, but in Cruz's case it's arguably true!
ThePlumLineGS	717799341470121984	2016-04-06T19:41:13	By any sensible metric, no one else would come close. (I'm fairly certain Cruz wouldn't disagree with the thesis.) 
ThePlumLineGS	717799605258170368	2016-04-06T19:42:16	polititrolls Yes, true in a way. But I think bringing up the Goldwater Girl stuff, while true, doesn't do justice to her whole career
ThePlumLineGS	717799435842031618	2016-04-06T19:41:36	DrewMTips fair Q, but in the post there's some interesting stuff re how they'd go against Cruz
ThePlumLineGS	717799220128980992	2016-04-06T19:40:44	Here's the case Dems will make against Ted Cruz, from Hillary Super PAC pollster geoffgarin: 
ThePlumLineGS	717798768205242368	2016-04-06T19:38:57	polititrolls I didn't take anything out; I misquoted him in the initial tweet, which I have since deleted.
ThePlumLineGS	717798148836601857	2016-04-06T19:36:29	Top Hillary-world pollster: Cruz would be "most extreme right wing nominee in American history": 
ThePlumLineGS	717778129423564805	2016-04-06T18:16:56	karpmj fair enough. agree with this balance? 
ThePlumLineGS	717776758762774528	2016-04-06T18:11:29	karpmj Okay. Will you allow that saying Bernie is stronger requires *some* measure of speculation?
ThePlumLineGS	717776018304589825	2016-04-06T18:08:33	karpmj and saying Sanders is viewed positively only goes so far. But again, I'm not arguing he's unelectable
ThePlumLineGS	717775734744461318	2016-04-06T18:07:25	karpmj only just skimmed it, but if she faces image deficit *and* she leads in many polls, that would seem to speak *for* her electability
ThePlumLineGS	717775080382722048	2016-04-06T18:04:49	ipikak1 that's not "truth," sorry
ThePlumLineGS	717774766673948672	2016-04-06T18:03:34	julia_azari thanks! maybe karpmj will respond
ThePlumLineGS	717774122265272322	2016-04-06T18:01:01	YeaYouRite karpmj Right, and I think that's weak as basis for saying he's more electable than she is, b/c there are so many other factors
ThePlumLineGS	717773902672486400	2016-04-06T18:00:08	karpmj YeaYouRite But is there serious evidence that he is *more* electable than she is? That's the Q.
ThePlumLineGS	717773749748105216	2016-04-06T17:59:32	YeaYouRite karpmj Ive never said Bernie is unelectable b/c "zomg socialist." I'm saying not enough evidence he's *more* electable than HRC
ThePlumLineGS	717772547148890112	2016-04-06T17:54:45	YeaYouRite karpmj Matt, do you think there is any basis for arguing that Bernie is vastly more electable than Hillary is?
ThePlumLineGS	717772156957036546	2016-04-06T17:53:12	karpmj the point is not to say that Bernie is unelectable. at least, that's not my point. 2/2
ThePlumLineGS	717772033606680576	2016-04-06T17:52:43	karpmj the point is that general elex polls alone are not good enough to make case that Bernie is vastly more electable than Hillary is 1/2
ThePlumLineGS	717766221039550465	2016-04-06T17:29:37	Steve King: A "good chunk" of remittances to Mexico are "laundered drug money":   
ThePlumLineGS	717766067595124736	2016-04-06T17:29:00	baseballcrank yeah I botched it...meant the remittances plan
ThePlumLineGS	717763633044930560	2016-04-06T17:19:20	jbview Agree. "not quite dead" =/= "lock"
ThePlumLineGS	717762073690836992	2016-04-06T17:13:08	JGreenDC definitely. point is that winning it all is still possible

ThePlumLineGS	717760401937711105	2016-04-06T17:06:29	rggoB8ycaIHwcSY I know, but he could take all the delegates. A big deal
ThePlumLineGS	717760264955904000	2016-04-06T17:05:57	karpmj I just don't see any basis for using general elex polling now to conclude that Bernie has better chance in Nov than Hillary does
ThePlumLineGS	717759969400061952	2016-04-06T17:04:46	New Monmouth poll of NY:  Trump 52 Kasich 25 Cruz 17    Maybe Trump is not dead quite yet
ThePlumLineGS	717759113803988992	2016-04-06T17:01:22	karpmj Yes. Good Q. I just think we should be cautious in both directions about Bernie. It's a bit of a unique situation.
ThePlumLineGS	717756726955663362	2016-04-06T16:51:53	karpmj And by "ask," I mean, ask. I don't know the answer.
ThePlumLineGS	717756648023003136	2016-04-06T16:51:34	karpmj One also has to ask whether fact that Bernie genuinely is significantly to the left might render polls less predictive 1/2
ThePlumLineGS	717756297270132738	2016-04-06T16:50:11	karpmj Understood, and agreed, which is why I tweeted my piece at you, to underscore that I don't lean that way
ThePlumLineGS	717755487635288065	2016-04-06T16:46:58	karpmj Right. My quarrel is with saying, "these general elex polls seven months out prove Bernie is more electable than Hillary is"
ThePlumLineGS	717754933827747840	2016-04-06T16:44:46	Very, very good paulwaldman1 piece sorting out the Hillary-Bernie dispute over guns: 
ThePlumLineGS	717754447544365056	2016-04-06T16:42:50	karpmj not quite sure what you're referring to here
ThePlumLineGS	717754002155421696	2016-04-06T16:41:03	leliorisen SteveOfTheFera nah. there are better arguments to make for Bernie than that.
ThePlumLineGS	717753791899115524	2016-04-06T16:40:13	karpmj Ah, yes, true.
ThePlumLineGS	717753633710936065	2016-04-06T16:39:36	weslata karpmj I guess you didn't read the piece, which talks about both enthusiasm among young and high HRC negatives
ThePlumLineGS	717753361462861824	2016-04-06T16:38:31	karpmj no, actually, it doesn't do that. it nowhere states that this is a valid premise; it says that this *has been argued.*
ThePlumLineGS	717753037725499396	2016-04-06T16:37:14	Here's paulwaldman1, defending Bernie (mostly) in the battle over guns with Hillary: 
ThePlumLineGS	717752716576034816	2016-04-06T16:35:57	karpmj you think it's valid methodology to use only current gen elex polling to decide Bernie has better chance in general than HRC?
ThePlumLineGS	717751054281142273	2016-04-06T16:29:21	karpmj right, I have not done that. I've done the opposite.
ThePlumLineGS	717750846608556032	2016-04-06T16:28:31	karpmj there are good arguments to make for why Sanders is electable and why Hillary could be weak 
ThePlumLineGS	717749885009850368	2016-04-06T16:24:42	karpmj ....also, some general elex polls show Clinton beating Trump or Cruz easily, so...
ThePlumLineGS	717749679895756800	2016-04-06T16:23:53	karpmj this is my view of the argument over electability 
ThePlumLineGS	717748531960918016	2016-04-06T16:19:19	karpmj debatable whether weakness "disappears" entirely, but even if true, many of these polls predate April
ThePlumLineGS	717747864605208577	2016-04-06T16:16:40	SteveOfTheFera Not sure exactly where the hard deadline is. But seven months out is way too far
ThePlumLineGS	717746612244770817	2016-04-06T16:11:42	YeaYouRite There are actually some GOOD arguments to make for why Sanders could be electable. They're here: 
ThePlumLineGS	717746296543711233	2016-04-06T16:10:26	SteveOfTheFera this is my effort to sort out the electability argument: 
ThePlumLineGS	717745499563024384	2016-04-06T16:07:16	SteveOfTheFera come on...basing an electability argument solely on general election polling this far out is just silly.
ThePlumLineGS	717744467193806848	2016-04-06T16:03:10	Area Sanders supporter throws political science out window to keep pumping up his hero 
ThePlumLineGS	717744000346812418	2016-04-06T16:01:19	Per taniel, Bernie netted 11 delegates last night: 
ThePlumLineGS	717730715442540544	2016-04-06T15:08:32	OccupyFortWorth bmaz also progressive in key ways. fought early for univ health care. pushed against deficit hawks inside Clinton admin
ThePlumLineGS	717730153066053632	2016-04-06T15:06:17	JMJLyons GreenPartyUS I hope she will prove that to all of us!
ThePlumLineGS	717730025756340224	2016-04-06T15:05:47	OccupyFortWorth bmaz also, I asked whether Bernie's attack on her fossil fuel money = "sliming."
ThePlumLineGS	717729858781057025	2016-04-06T15:05:07	OccupyFortWorth bmaz If you have followed Hillary closely over the years, you'll know that she isn't merely a "conservative"
ThePlumLineGS	717729685044649985	2016-04-06T15:04:26	JMJLyons Cool! If Hillary is the nominee, will you vote for her?
ThePlumLineGS	717728645683527680	2016-04-06T15:00:18	OccupyFortWorth bmaz let's back up. What is your point, exactly?
ThePlumLineGS	717728053758205952	2016-04-06T14:57:57	OccupyFortWorth bmaz I think I'll take word of Open Secrets over Sanders supporters on question of whether Bernie's criticism is fair
ThePlumLineGS	717727242479149057	2016-04-06T14:54:43	OccupyFortWorth When someone says Bernie has been "slimed," that's kind of the implication. Try again.
ThePlumLineGS	717726916682375172	2016-04-06T14:53:26	bmaz OccupyFortWorth thanks, likewise
ThePlumLineGS	717726420538101760	2016-04-06T14:51:28	OccupyFortWorth Note to you: Stop with the phony piety about one side supposedly being unfairly "attacked." It's deeply boring.
ThePlumLineGS	717725687025635328	2016-04-06T14:48:33	When Hillary told GlennThrush Bernie is not a Dem, it highlighted a critical point:  
ThePlumLineGS	717724158520590336	2016-04-06T14:42:28	cdub2439 Diggles do all those Democrats who voted for Hillary (more than for Bernie) count as "the base"
ThePlumLineGS	717723675370397696	2016-04-06T14:40:33	DerekBassett Party was more divided in 2008, and it united. Same will happen again, and D-leaning indys will be alienated by Trump or Cruz
ThePlumLineGS	717722293976371201	2016-04-06T14:35:04	Diggles yep. I noted in there that this is a crucial part of her pitch
ThePlumLineGS	717715387991728128	2016-04-06T14:07:37	Less cyncially, the Clintons have always been party builders. And Dems really need that now.  
ThePlumLineGS	717716011475185664	2016-04-06T14:10:06	Danjanison THE CHORUS!!! I miss the chorus.
ThePlumLineGS	717714212915687424	2016-04-06T14:02:57	luismadrb My point is that looking at Sanders's actual mathematical situation is not somehow anti-Sanders.
ThePlumLineGS	717713376089079808	2016-04-06T13:59:37	DerekBassett I think they'll take the necessary steps to repair any damage done
ThePlumLineGS	717712225910321152	2016-04-06T13:55:03	luismadrb Your suggestion that pointing out mathematical realities = campaigning for Hillary says more about you than me
ThePlumLineGS	717711704918990848	2016-04-06T13:52:59	jacobraleigh maybe, though that also includes pledged delegate totals...
ThePlumLineGS	717711370280689664	2016-04-06T13:51:39	This from ThePlumLineGS is spot-on. Do you see Democrats as fighting the good fight? Or part of the problem?  
ThePlumLineGS	717711465441001472	2016-04-06T13:52:02	mlow29 it's a tough, contested primary. so?

ThePlumLineGS	717710505184530432	2016-04-06T13:48:13	Here's mmurraypolitics, on what Bernie won last night:  
ThePlumLineGS	717707466369269760	2016-04-06T13:36:08	Clinton blasted Sanders for not being a Democrat, because it is a fundamental difference.  
ThePlumLineGS	717706879728803840	2016-04-06T13:33:49	bmaz I'm just hoping we can move beyond this pious idea that one is more guilty of "sliming" the other
ThePlumLineGS	717706051961950209	2016-04-06T13:30:31	bmaz Open Secrets says Bernie criticism of fossil fuel lobbyist money is "disingenuous," not sure why this doesn't qualify as "sliming"
ThePlumLineGS	717705489069522944	2016-04-06T13:28:17	@AmKonDotNet bye, blocked
ThePlumLineGS	717705378721566720	2016-04-06T13:27:51	bmaz Weird, those Hillary shills at Open Secrets said Bernie's criticism is "disingenuous." Is that "sliming," too?

ThePlumLineGS	717704998499532800	2016-04-06T13:26:20	davidaxelrod Yep, in fact, Hillary has already telegraphed this: 
ThePlumLineGS	717704804919873538	2016-04-06T13:25:34	This attack is more than a rank partisan appeal. It gets at a fundamental difference between the two: 
ThePlumLineGS	717704427667398656	2016-04-06T13:24:04	bmaz Right, because Clinton's entire career can be summed up by "Goldwater Girl"
ThePlumLineGS	717704093049950208	2016-04-06T13:22:44	asaar23 Well, on health care they have a genuine difference over whether pushing for single payer is desirable right now
ThePlumLineGS	717703590161342465	2016-04-06T13:20:44	asaar23 thanks. Look, pushing for more is good and important. But I'm not comfortable with reductive interpretations of Obama era
ThePlumLineGS	717702763971477505	2016-04-06T13:17:27	asaar23 JamilSmith If you actually read the piece, you might discover that it's fair to Bernie. Disappointing, right?
ThePlumLineGS	717702646254149632	2016-04-06T13:16:59	asaar23 JamilSmith Bernie and Hillary fundamentally disagree about the value of Obama's achievements
ThePlumLineGS	717702314459578372	2016-04-06T13:15:40	asaar23 JamilSmith I think Obama era advances were actually important and worth preserving, but I guess that's just me.
ThePlumLineGS	717700722343743492	2016-04-06T13:09:21	Hillary just hammered Bernie for not being a real Democrat. It's all about the map to come:

ThePlumLineGS	717686183178932224	2016-04-06T12:11:34	This is in response to Hillary's suggestion to GlennThrush that Bernie is misleading young voters:

ThePlumLineGS	717443197232881664	2016-04-05T20:06:02	via ThePlumLineGS, Trump's wall/remittance plan would require banks and wire services to profile Mexican-Americans. 
ThePlumLineGS	717443688545325056	2016-04-05T20:07:59	JoshVoorhees Good stuff but note that Devine says he'll try for super dels even if trailing in pledged dels:

ThePlumLineGS	717434654048051200	2016-04-05T19:32:05	Trump's new Mexico proposal is much crazier and more nightmarish than you thought

ThePlumLineGS	717423794403602435	2016-04-05T18:48:56	And experts think his remittance policy would actually lead to more illegal immigration:  
ThePlumLineGS	717422891055333381	2016-04-05T18:45:20	proteinwisdom the thing I'd like to see clarified is whether this means only transfers to Mexico
ThePlumLineGS	717421711386288128	2016-04-05T18:40:39	proteinwisdom It seems like that is what it would require at a minimum, yes
ThePlumLineGS	717420507155591168	2016-04-05T18:35:52	Or it might require literally every single person transferring $$ abroad to provide proof of lawful presence: 
ThePlumLineGS	717420223788359680	2016-04-05T18:34:45	ForecasterEnten Right. It would either require this or it would subject every transfer of $ anywhere to be subjected to this check
ThePlumLineGS	717419914139734016	2016-04-05T18:33:31	Trump's new proposal might require private businesses to profile Mexicans, for instance:

ThePlumLineGS	717367621918801920	2016-04-05T15:05:43	Doublebeekabug BernieSanders I have actually made that case at length: 
ThePlumLineGS	717366517948661762	2016-04-05T15:01:20	Doublebeekabug yeah I think that's mostly a fantasy, but we'll see
ThePlumLineGS	717366155636252672	2016-04-05T14:59:54	Doublebeekabug Your contempt for all those who voted for her is surprising given your anger at how she has allegedly treated Bernie backers

ThePlumLineGS	717364820169920512	2016-04-05T14:54:35	Doublebeekabug So you're saying that even if Bernie is behind in pledged dels and pop vote, superdelegates should swing nom to him?

ThePlumLineGS	717359320137121792	2016-04-05T14:32:44	Doublebeekabug so it's okay for Bernie to behave like an evil Clinton?

ThePlumLineGS	716994779813429248	2016-04-04T14:24:11	rggoB8ycaIHwcSY um, okay then, you tell yourself that
ThePlumLineGS	716993612463087616	2016-04-04T14:19:32	CarlPaulus the point is, this notion that Bernie should have attacked her "earlier" is bullshit.
ThePlumLineGS	716993186414125057	2016-04-04T14:17:51	Folks, Bernie attacked Hillary as too beholden to Wall Street literally days after he announced, last May:

ThePlumLineGS	716943080675483650	2016-04-04T10:58:45	Also think Sherrod (and Liz Warren) could play key role in uniting Hillary/Bernie forces:  
ThePlumLineGS	716675248528232448	2016-04-03T17:14:29	i'm surprised by both. Sanders should be up bigger in Wis; Clinton should be up bigger in NY

ThePlumLineGS	716618592519856128	2016-04-03T13:29:21	Still, I'm skeptical Hillary is up in Wisconsin. Seems very unlikely.

ThePlumLineGS	716272472539209728	2016-04-02T14:33:59	armandodkos Read the piece if you want, it spells that out.
ThePlumLineGS	716272322899013633	2016-04-02T14:33:24	armandodkos Once again, I'm not agreeing with Sanders on that point. Nonetheless, he *still* raises valid Qs about system's problems.

ThePlumLineGS	716271586278510593	2016-04-02T14:30:28	armandodkos Oh, that's just silly. Because winning at SCOTUS is a long way off, we shouldn't debate the issue?

ThePlumLineGS	716270634620293120	2016-04-02T14:26:41	armandodkos I pointed out that Bernie's *larger critique* of the system raises fair questions, while arguing his attacks on her are unfair.

ThePlumLineGS	716021178893250561	2016-04-01T21:55:26	OccupyFortWorth He should clarify that he doesn't think her positions are direct result of $ (which I imagine he believes)
ThePlumLineGS	716021036748292096	2016-04-01T21:54:52	OccupyFortWorth My view is that Bernie should be saying that participating in this system *risks* falling sway to undue influence.
ThePlumLineGS	716020538670518272	2016-04-01T21:52:54	OccupyFortWorth right, this is the game he's playing. that's my point.
ThePlumLineGS	716020207970566145	2016-04-01T21:51:35	These big hauls are very impressive. Bernie has every justification to take this all the way to convention. 
ThePlumLineGS	716019902377816064	2016-04-01T21:50:22	OccupyFortWorth True, and she fought dirty in 2008.
ThePlumLineGS	716019727638863872	2016-04-01T21:49:40	OccupyFortWorth I simply want to know if he believes her positions are the direct result of the $$$ she's taking. Too much to ask?
ThePlumLineGS	716019524471009280	2016-04-01T21:48:52	JakeMadtown Yes, and many of these differences are legitimate and worthy of hashing out. I object to the innuendo being employed here.
ThePlumLineGS	716019186418458624	2016-04-01T21:47:31	OccupyFortWorth that said, I think Bernie makes important larger points about the campaign finance system: 
ThePlumLineGS	716018892125184000	2016-04-01T21:46:21	OccupyFortWorth this is a game Bernie has been playing for months, and his supporters should be willing to admit it. 2/2
ThePlumLineGS	716018787867303936	2016-04-01T21:45:56	OccupyFortWorth I agree with you on that. Sometimes Clinton camp is too quick to whine about "attacks." But 1/2
ThePlumLineGS	716018477199462400	2016-04-01T21:44:42	OccupyFortWorth Sanders backers are screaming that it is unfair to suggest that he is trying to imply she is corrupt w/o saying so directly
ThePlumLineGS	716017857767817216	2016-04-01T21:42:14	JakeMadtown thanks for saying it's even handed, though. tell that to your Sanders-supporting buddies ;)
ThePlumLineGS	716017641920602112	2016-04-01T21:41:23	JakeMadtown right. but motive of donors separate issue from whether the money buys policy positions.

ThePlumLineGS	716016456916406272	2016-04-01T21:36:40	JakeMadtown my piece says that Sanders makes some legit larger points about the system, so...
ThePlumLineGS	716016305216888833	2016-04-01T21:36:04	OccupyFortWorth correct, and I that's a fair argument to make. But you really have to play dumb to ignore the added layer of innuendo here
ThePlumLineGS	716016082016972802	2016-04-01T21:35:11	JakeMadtown My piece says Sanders makes a legit larger argument about the system. I just object to the innuendo.

ThePlumLineGS	715997034000609280	2016-04-01T20:19:30	thehuntinghouse ActuallyImGood I think the better argument for campaign finance reform is in the name of political equality.
ThePlumLineGS	715996625357897728	2016-04-01T20:17:52	thehuntinghouse ActuallyImGood ZephyrTeachout I'm familiar with these issues, friend. I'm with rickhasen. Defining corruption difficult.

ThePlumLineGS	715993208807931904	2016-04-01T20:04:18	thehuntinghouse ActuallyImGood So your position is that her policy positions are directly shaped by the donations, right?
ThePlumLineGS	715992985331220480	2016-04-01T20:03:24	JohnMayVT armandodkos right, and he initially made same point about Bernie's criticism of Hillary on fossil fuels
ThePlumLineGS	715992559546445824	2016-04-01T20:01:43	thehuntinghouse ActuallyImGood armandodkos defining corrupt here as: her positions are shaped directly by the money
ThePlumLineGS	715992335675473921	2016-04-01T20:00:49	thehuntinghouse ActuallyImGood I don't believe she is, but it's deeply odd that you care more what I think than what Saint Bernie thinks

ThePlumLineGS	715991719456727042	2016-04-01T19:58:23	thehuntinghouse ActuallyImGood armandodkos Not even Bernie Sanders will say that.

ThePlumLineGS	715986747784577024	2016-04-01T19:38:37	ActuallyImGood It's complicated. Rick Hasen's book this is very good

ThePlumLineGS	715985407046000641	2016-04-01T19:33:18	thehuntinghouse armandodkos it must be really dispiriting to you that Bernie refuses to say whether he thinks she's been corrupted.

ThePlumLineGS	715925179046760448	2016-04-01T15:33:58	From Open Secrets: 
ThePlumLineGS	715925027338731521	2016-04-01T15:33:22	blucaller BostonBoomer well, I have repeatedly said that Sanders is attacking her character without admitting that's what he's doing
ThePlumLineGS	715922385778642944	2016-04-01T15:22:52	blucaller well, my thing says she has a legitimate beef with the innuendo Sanders has been using
ThePlumLineGS	715918306616717312	2016-04-01T15:06:40	armandodkos I definitely think Sanders' rhetoric on ABC was slippery and innuendo-laden.
ThePlumLineGS	715917857524215810	2016-04-01T15:04:53	armandodkos I understand that argument. This is why I've been asking them to clarify what they meant.
ThePlumLineGS	715917416077926400	2016-04-01T15:03:07	armandodkos I think "innuendo" is the fairer word for it. But I'm open to hearing why that's wrong
ThePlumLineGS	715917129690779650	2016-04-01T15:01:59	armandodkos The Sanders camp claims it is referring to money bundled by lobbyists. If that is true, then "lie" might be too strong.

ThePlumLineGS	713371158347923456	2016-03-25T14:25:12	philipaklein DouthatNYT I really wonder whether the threats of violence you talked about are designed to help get unbounds

ThePlumLineGS	713370263119912961	2016-03-25T14:21:39	DouthatNYT philipaklein right
ThePlumLineGS	713370181599408128	2016-03-25T14:21:19	GerryDales we'll see about that, but even beyond that, bigger his lead, better chance he riles up supporters and does more damage
ThePlumLineGS	713369935632793600	2016-03-25T14:20:21	DouthatNYT philipaklein I can see that. Just saying strategy to minimize latter potentially makes former bigger. Crux of dilemma
ThePlumLineGS	713369399621718016	2016-03-25T14:18:13	GerryDales sure. and both staying in accomplishes that best. but there is *also* a downside to it. that's my point
ThePlumLineGS	713369156444418048	2016-03-25T14:17:15	philipaklein Right. I can see that. But downside is Trump ends up with larger lead over runner up. That's the crux of the dilemma.
ThePlumLineGS	713368993009123328	2016-03-25T14:16:36	philipaklein right...seems like there's no single clear uniformly advantageous strategy here
ThePlumLineGS	713368715803430912	2016-03-25T14:15:30	GerryDales downside to *both* staying in, not to *either in particular* staying in
ThePlumLineGS	713368377620893696	2016-03-25T14:14:09	GerryDales in this analysis, no one is saying there's a downside to Cruz in particular staying in.
ThePlumLineGS	713368154764931072	2016-03-25T14:13:16	GerryDales In fact, Spies explicitly makes your point *and* his own point.
ThePlumLineGS	713367890360188928	2016-03-25T14:12:13	GerryDales nobody is arguing against that point. rather, they're saying that that there is *also* a downside to Cruz/Kaisch staying in.
ThePlumLineGS	713367404810780672	2016-03-25T14:10:17	GerryDales see the quotes from Charlie Spies here 
ThePlumLineGS	713366750931378176	2016-03-25T14:07:41	GerryDales sure. but the larger the margin, the *stronger* his case.
ThePlumLineGS	713366613484040192	2016-03-25T14:07:09	philipaklein right, I didn't say he'd definitely succeed; just said that his chances *increase* with a larger delegate lead
ThePlumLineGS	713364537987239937	2016-03-25T13:58:54	Neoavatara understandable!
ThePlumLineGS	713363719057776640	2016-03-25T13:55:38	The deeper problem here: If Kasich/Cruz divide up non-Trump delegates, he seems like clearer victor:

ThePlumLineGS	713353859985485824	2016-03-25T13:16:28	cshields11 my sense is a lot of Rs genuinely think Trump nomination is worst possible outcome, so willing to risk contested convention

ThePlumLineGS	712725149808738304	2016-03-23T19:38:12	red_boxer0 eh, not really. I'm just saying that Ryan didn't really make any concessions to the reformocons to speak of, and 1/2
ThePlumLineGS	712724562992107520	2016-03-23T19:35:52	red_boxer0 so, for instance, the reformocons want both more progressive taxation and proactive policies (Ryan not there on either yet)
ThePlumLineGS	712723954985791488	2016-03-23T19:33:27	red_boxer0 but reformocons want Rs to break with the general idea that only free markets and lower taxes are the answer
ThePlumLineGS	712723587942203392	2016-03-23T19:31:59	red_boxer0 right, but the reformocons want Rs like Ryan to accept that proactive government policy actually can help people economically
ThePlumLineGS	712723307066441728	2016-03-23T19:30:52	red_boxer0 no, the harder half is the idea that government policy can actually help some of these struggling voters
ThePlumLineGS	712723055374630912	2016-03-23T19:29:52	Hmmm. Because GOP voters want to hear this stuff? How many polls have to show this before you'll believe it? 
ThePlumLineGS	712722752634011648	2016-03-23T19:28:40	red_boxer0 sure. I'm just saying that Ryan is not offering any serious proactive middle class agenda.

ThePlumLineGS	712241772756393984	2016-03-22T11:37:26	mtracey Understandable! But W. was an incumbent and economy was growing. Look, anything is possible...I think it'll (probably) be okay.

ThePlumLineGS	712240979907051520	2016-03-22T11:34:17	rtraister fair enough...Trump as president merits erring on the side of worry!
ThePlumLineGS	712240768073785344	2016-03-22T11:33:26	mtracey fair enough. but the data suggests that might not impact the specific choice voters will likely face this fall

ThePlumLineGS	712238273960255488	2016-03-22T11:23:31	rtraister fwiw, our polling found Hillary more trusted on terrorism than Trump

ThePlumLineGS	712235923707142144	2016-03-22T11:14:11	There is zero reason to simply assume terrorism helps Trump against Hillary, if she's nominee. Trump blustering isn't predictive.

ThePlumLineGS	711969595012227072	2016-03-21T17:35:53	applesurvivor that's a strange response to a piece that criticizes Clinton.
ThePlumLineGS	711969478976933889	2016-03-21T17:35:26	Real_JMOOB there is always some justification for the fantasy that demographics (in national elections) will suddenly reverse direction.
ThePlumLineGS	711967022360469504	2016-03-21T17:25:40	Real_JMOOB okay, so ignore the data then!
ThePlumLineGS	711966786124701696	2016-03-21T17:24:44	TyHealey that doesn't really make sense as a model
ThePlumLineGS	711964859122978816	2016-03-21T17:17:04	ggreenwald it was even somewhat critical!
ThePlumLineGS	711964773911494656	2016-03-21T17:16:44	robertagreer nah, not against Hillary (versus against Obama), and at any rate, all the assumptions used here are overly generous to Trump
ThePlumLineGS	711964223417540608	2016-03-21T17:14:33	ggreenwald Paul's piece was not particularly complimentary
ThePlumLineGS	711962217181290496	2016-03-21T17:06:34	Excellent dissection of Hillary's speech to AIPAC (she got to Trump's RIGHT) from paulwaldman1: 
ThePlumLineGS	711959851426041856	2016-03-21T16:57:10	ZecTurd pbump True, but there's always a justification for this, and it hasn't proven right yet (in national elections)
ThePlumLineGS	711959542473617408	2016-03-21T16:55:57	ZecTurd pbump I'd argue it's more likely that everything Trump says/does to drive up white turnout will also drive up nonwhite turnout
ThePlumLineGS	711959368363859969	2016-03-21T16:55:15	ZecTurd pbump washingtonpost we'll see, but Rs subscribed to similar demographic fantasies in the last national election (2012)

ThePlumLineGS	711953601120313344	2016-03-21T16:32:20	ddrenle yes, he probably will need to win one of PA, WI, and MI.
ThePlumLineGS	711952755468984321	2016-03-21T16:28:59	ddrenle rust belt is his *best* hope for inroads. will probably need more than OH.

ThePlumLineGS	711949377330401281	2016-03-21T16:15:33	ddale8 not really. I think it's daunting for Trump but also that Ds need to focus on the true source of his appeal
ThePlumLineGS	711947428237332481	2016-03-21T16:07:48	SilvestriWoman sure, but the point is that he needs to run up enormous margins among those voters
ThePlumLineGS	711945059898359809	2016-03-21T15:58:24	SilvestriWoman look at the numbers...Trump has to run up truly huge margins among blue collar whites, even in swing states

ThePlumLineGS	711923256043896836	2016-03-21T14:31:45	MABlumenfeld JGreenDC Def. This analysis presumes (in first half) Hillary wins same share of college whites Obama did (generous to Trump)
ThePlumLineGS	711922685165641728	2016-03-21T14:29:29	MABlumenfeld JGreenDC yeah -- it's unlikely but even if it did happen it would have to be astronomical
ThePlumLineGS	711922508178563072	2016-03-21T14:28:47	xpostfactoid1 nah he kept it constant
ThePlumLineGS	711922431213105153	2016-03-21T14:28:29	JGreenDC MABlumenfeld yep. Teixeira projects that as well (see his quote at the end)
ThePlumLineGS	711921947907637248	2016-03-21T14:26:33	xpostfactoid1 definitely agree
ThePlumLineGS	711921681632247809	2016-03-21T14:25:30	xpostfactoid1 yeah, of course, always. but not sure even a major shock does it, if Dem is Hillary
ThePlumLineGS	711921027387932672	2016-03-21T14:22:54	awzurcher Heh, understood. I'd argue Rubio or Jeb could have plausibly made real inroads among young/Latino/college educated whites
ThePlumLineGS	711908988967849984	2016-03-21T13:35:04	Yep. Already near upper boundary. 
ThePlumLineGS	711918712224407552	2016-03-21T14:13:42	RyanDEnos that's a fair argument, but it's plausible that Trump takes care of that drop off problem
ThePlumLineGS	711918524931960833	2016-03-21T14:12:57	RyanDEnos right. it's more likely that if Trump is nominee, turnout works to Dems' benefit.
ThePlumLineGS	711918303636295682	2016-03-21T14:12:05	RyanDEnos I think Rubio or Jeb could have plausibly made real inroads among Latinos &amp; young voters. Trump's only hope is blue collar whites
ThePlumLineGS	711917855336435713	2016-03-21T14:10:18	RyanDEnos no, it's that TRUMP would face an uphill battle because of demographics. Is that not clear?
ThePlumLineGS	711917709668253696	2016-03-21T14:09:43	awzurcher Also, you forgot to bring your withering snark to bear on this piece: 
ThePlumLineGS	711915544602136576	2016-03-21T14:01:07	"All of things that Trump might say and do to drive up white turnout... would also likely drive up nonwhite turnout" 
ThePlumLineGS	711916476475772928	2016-03-21T14:04:49	awzurcher Actually, I was advising that folks should take Trump seriously last summer. Were you?
ThePlumLineGS	711916176700477441	2016-03-21T14:03:37	DouthatNYT SeanTrende also note that this presumes Hillary wins same share of college whites that Obama did, which is generous to Trump
ThePlumLineGS	711915889789108225	2016-03-21T14:02:29	DouthatNYT SeanTrende right. nor does it seem optimized for boosting white turnout but not nonwhite turnout
ThePlumLineGS	711915684763181056	2016-03-21T14:01:40	SeanTrende right, gotcha
ThePlumLineGS	711915477539397632	2016-03-21T14:00:51	DavidBGail this analysis does not presume that, it presumes the same share for both
ThePlumLineGS	711915343267102720	2016-03-21T14:00:19	SeanTrende right. I recognize/agree that anything can happen
ThePlumLineGS	711915243107127296	2016-03-21T13:59:55	mgoblue7777777 actually, it directly addresses the turnout question. you must have missed it
ThePlumLineGS	711914244049149954	2016-03-21T13:55:57	SeanTrende you'd need these jumps and you'd need nonwhite spread to remain constant, right?
ThePlumLineGS	711913431935406080	2016-03-21T13:52:43	ron_fournier byelin the point is that the specific argument about shifting map by running up the white vote is the "pipe dream"
ThePlumLineGS	711912885421740033	2016-03-21T13:50:33	SeanTrende I hope you'll look at Ruy's analysis, interested in your thoughts on it 
ThePlumLineGS	711912710125051904	2016-03-21T13:49:51	If this election is not close, it will blow up the "both sides" sham, apparently

ThePlumLineGS	711910230007922689	2016-03-21T13:40:00	TheRickWilson Right. This analysis presumes Hillary does same as Obama among nonwhites AND college educated whites. Generous to Trump.
ThePlumLineGS	711909893662441473	2016-03-21T13:38:39	jarsthemule you are right, the Trump Rust Belt fantasy is precisely that
ThePlumLineGS	711909189925380099	2016-03-21T13:35:52	TheRickWilson Ruy Teixeira concludes that he'd have to improve over Romney by double digits among white working class
ThePlumLineGS	711908250170626053	2016-03-21T13:32:08	Trump would need to improve over Romney by double digits among working class whites in most Rust Belt states: 
ThePlumLineGS	711907554222338048	2016-03-21T13:29:22	The idea that Trump can change the map by running up white votes is a pipe dream, new analysis shows: 
ThePlumLineGS	711886166065176580	2016-03-21T12:04:22	That might be different if more than two questions about climate change had been asked during the debates.

ThePlumLineGS	710820864875503617	2016-03-18T13:31:15	JoshuaGreen exactly. the only thing they agree on is deny Trump nomination outright. then what?
ThePlumLineGS	710819631653642241	2016-03-18T13:26:21	The Stop Trump movement is falling apart. The signs are everywhere:

ThePlumLineGS	710812983363026944	2016-03-18T12:59:56	Podcast alert: I chatted about the election with brianbeutler here, hope you enjoy: 
ThePlumLineGS	710801449140137985	2016-03-18T12:14:06	Awwwwwww. White dudes think Hillary doesn't care about them enough. BRB finding my tiny violin. 
ThePlumLineGS	710799931745894402	2016-03-18T12:08:04	Davidzteich the WH strongly believes Rs will cave before elex, so he might have seen this as very unlikely 2/2
ThePlumLineGS	710799819804176384	2016-03-18T12:07:37	Davidzteich That's possible. But it's also possible he told him that he'd have to defer to HRC if she wins 1/2
ThePlumLineGS	710799568963772416	2016-03-18T12:06:37	ClayHarper in this scenario, Obama would simply be deferring to the Dem who won the election (could be Hillary)
ThePlumLineGS	710799383823060992	2016-03-18T12:05:53	Davidzteich all he would be doing is deferring to Hillary.
ThePlumLineGS	710798977223041024	2016-03-18T12:04:16	truesubmariner Arianna8927 washingtonpost right, but liberals are likely to call on him to do that even if Hillary wins

ThePlumLineGS	710796893652185088	2016-03-18T11:56:00	5thCircAppeals the scenario of Garland getting confirmed before election is also outlined in my thing
ThePlumLineGS	710795996331155456	2016-03-18T11:52:26	talhamkhan no,this would presumably apply if Hillary won, too. all explained in the link
ThePlumLineGS	710795166639120389	2016-03-18T11:49:08	Arianna8927 no, presumably that would also be in effect if Hillary won 
ThePlumLineGS	710795011319861248	2016-03-18T11:48:31	DouglasLevene It's not a question of "right." After the election, Obama could choose to defer to Hillary (or Bernie) if one of them wins

ThePlumLineGS	710791395901100032	2016-03-18T11:34:09	EtreEtro but liberals may call on Obama to do this if Hillary is elected

ThePlumLineGS	710783917943607297	2016-03-18T11:04:26	stahlscott AdamSerwer nytimes I did a whole thing on that, if interested: 
ThePlumLineGS	710783646018441216	2016-03-18T11:03:21	GOP voters are betraying conservatism by backing Trump. But Paul Ryan will support him, anyway:

ThePlumLineGS	710571875777298433	2016-03-17T21:01:51	ffa0213 NormOrnstein right, that scenario is in there, see last graf
ThePlumLineGS	710571643706408960	2016-03-17T21:00:56	Zachy224 NormOrnstein doesn't have to be cynical. He'd prefer MG confirmed now; if not, and she wins elex, he defers to her
ThePlumLineGS	710563556157169666	2016-03-17T20:28:48	here's theplumlineGS on my Ryan intvw: R voters are spoiling Paul Ryan's dream of grand triumph for conservatism 
ThePlumLineGS	710560260055015426	2016-03-17T20:15:42	RJVanAuken majorajam yep! No prob
ThePlumLineGS	710554678782791680	2016-03-17T19:53:31	RJVanAuken majorajam hah, maybe. I think it would be defensible. But he probably won't do it anyway
ThePlumLineGS	710554442769289216	2016-03-17T19:52:35	RJVanAuken majorajam That is possible. But I don't think it would have to look bad. Still, he probably won't do it anyway, so...
ThePlumLineGS	710553821387296768	2016-03-17T19:50:07	toaeroplano jbouie I agree. Have repeatedly argued Ds should not underestimate Trump
ThePlumLineGS	710553691691094017	2016-03-17T19:49:36	RJVanAuken majorajam That's fair. My point is that it would not be crazy to defer to next prez after Rs declined to act before elex
ThePlumLineGS	710552909897994240	2016-03-17T19:46:29	carsonstanwood 
ThePlumLineGS	710552732382396416	2016-03-17T19:45:47	RJVanAuken majorajam This is silly. Obama is allowed to withdraw nom for whatever reason he chooses. Now I'm really done with this
ThePlumLineGS	710551403425562626	2016-03-17T19:40:30	RJVanAuken majorajam it doesn't politicize the court at all; it simply defers the choice to the newly elected president
ThePlumLineGS	710551284844261377	2016-03-17T19:40:02	jbouie yep. this is Benenson's argument against the whole alleged "blue collar white" problem...a lot of these Rs are blue collar whites
ThePlumLineGS	710550961312436225	2016-03-17T19:38:45	RJVanAuken majorajam I gotta run, let's pick this up some other time
ThePlumLineGS	710550553198256135	2016-03-17T19:37:07	RJVanAuken majorajam He has no constitutional duty to stick with the same nominee after the election is over.
ThePlumLineGS	710550357345234944	2016-03-17T19:36:21	RJVanAuken majorajam Right, but in that scenario, Hillary would also support that nominee!
ThePlumLineGS	710550064507260929	2016-03-17T19:35:11	RJVanAuken majorajam If more Dems liked Garland, then Hillary would also probably pick him. Your point is pretty much meaningless
ThePlumLineGS	710549204125556736	2016-03-17T19:31:46	RJVanAuken majorajam what on earth are you talking about? in that scenario, Rs *wouldn't* act on Obama's nominee in the lame duck.
ThePlumLineGS	710549078476767232	2016-03-17T19:31:16	Also in this piece: Paul Ryan makes it clear in a new interview that he'll accept Trump as nominee: 
ThePlumLineGS	710548913737048066	2016-03-17T19:30:37	RJVanAuken majorajam It's not even clear what you mean by "political," other than, "bad, somehow"
ThePlumLineGS	710548697759797250	2016-03-17T19:29:45	RJVanAuken majorajam that doesn't make it "political," whatever you even mean by that. It would be deferring to Clinton, full stop.
ThePlumLineGS	710547948946456577	2016-03-17T19:26:47	RJVanAuken majorajam If Obama decided to defer to Clinton after she won, why would that be "political"?
ThePlumLineGS	710546290615173121	2016-03-17T19:20:11	NEW: Paul Ryan's dream of a grand triumph for conservatism is being dashed...by GOP voters: 
ThePlumLineGS	710510147345506305	2016-03-17T16:56:34	Trump v. Clinton could produce the biggest gender gap in history:  And I made a chart! 
ThePlumLineGS	710506703712886788	2016-03-17T16:42:53	Good stuff. And it's supported by the data, too:  
ThePlumLineGS	710505578460798976	2016-03-17T16:38:25	If GOP nominates Trump, it could produce an unprecedented gender gap. paulwaldman1 brings the chart: 
ThePlumLineGS	710502753215389696	2016-03-17T16:27:11	Chiara09 that would not be disrespecting him
ThePlumLineGS	710502187244376064	2016-03-17T16:24:56	Mitch McConnell demolishes GOP argument for considering Garland in lame duck:  
ThePlumLineGS	710492410283950080	2016-03-17T15:46:05	shocked, shocked 
ThePlumLineGS	710490399954100224	2016-03-17T15:38:06	Good RonBrownstein on how Trump might compete in Rust Belt:   FWIW, benensonj disagrees: 
ThePlumLineGS	710484784229847040	2016-03-17T15:15:47	BBQchknMadness yes.
ThePlumLineGS	710484727841603584	2016-03-17T15:15:33	RJVanAuken nah, he'd simply be deferring to Hillary at that point. That's all.
ThePlumLineGS	710484126286094337	2016-03-17T15:13:10	beth4158 yeselson indeed!
ThePlumLineGS	710483448700518400	2016-03-17T15:10:28	RJVanAuken no because at that point, election would have already happened
ThePlumLineGS	710483364764098560	2016-03-17T15:10:08	nazeem_z I know that. I'm saying this is what might happen instead. Merely floating an interesting possibility
ThePlumLineGS	710481280576704512	2016-03-17T15:01:52	Southfive Of course Hillary might fully support him at that point, too, so this could all be moot 2/2
ThePlumLineGS	710481190445260800	2016-03-17T15:01:30	Southfive yes, though Obama could theoretically say he's deferring to Hillary at that point (the election would have already happened) 1/2
ThePlumLineGS	710479830203154433	2016-03-17T14:56:06	Southfive Yeah. My basic point is that if Rs don't consider him, you might see pressure to pull pick after elex and let Hillary decide
ThePlumLineGS	710479313188089858	2016-03-17T14:54:02	Southfive in fairness, a lot of liberals are *currently* criticizing Garland pick
ThePlumLineGS	710479182631989250	2016-03-17T14:53:31	ColumbusNYC achadjohnson it's plausible that Obama would not give any assurances about what Hillary would want
ThePlumLineGS	710478445642432512	2016-03-17T14:50:36	This is the argument that we will probably hear more of ---&gt; 
ThePlumLineGS	710478106679713792	2016-03-17T14:49:15	tchanta drewbreess I don't think it would be a backstab; he's simply defer to Hillary (theoretically)
ThePlumLineGS	710477848319016960	2016-03-17T14:48:13	hangingsliders definitely possible
ThePlumLineGS	710477485402693632	2016-03-17T14:46:47	IrishJimmy2 certainly possible!
ThePlumLineGS	710476676237492224	2016-03-17T14:43:34	kptrease certainly possible she'd support him in this scenario!
ThePlumLineGS	710463012000415745	2016-03-17T13:49:16	 cc ThePlumLineGS 
ThePlumLineGS	710476129447100416	2016-03-17T14:41:23	kptrease maybe. but election would have happened. plausible to take HRC's views into account (if she won)
ThePlumLineGS	710475679817703424	2016-03-17T14:39:36	tchanta drewbreess theoretically, b/c Rs would have said No, and the election would have happened at that point. not predicting it.
ThePlumLineGS	710475346567626754	2016-03-17T14:38:17	section_sign not at all. O actually wants him confirmed
ThePlumLineGS	710474532449087490	2016-03-17T14:35:03	Possible permission structure for Rs to confirm Garland before elex: "dastardly O will shaft us in lame duck" 
ThePlumLineGS	710473841798201345	2016-03-17T14:32:18	jonowles88 maybe, unlikely but at least possible
ThePlumLineGS	710473714522050560	2016-03-17T14:31:48	deeeebers17 it's certainly possible that she'd pick him
ThePlumLineGS	710473355334279168	2016-03-17T14:30:22	ThePlumLineGS well..that's a pretty common feature of a WH press briefing. still definitely an interesting/possible scenario to write about
ThePlumLineGS	710473583844270080	2016-03-17T14:31:17	justinsink heh, fair point. thanks
ThePlumLineGS	710473518413168640	2016-03-17T14:31:01	drewbreess he'd be merely deferring to Hillary, that's all
ThePlumLineGS	710472816240562177	2016-03-17T14:28:13	justinsink definitely. also, it's pretty interesting/revealing that he needed to be pushed, isn't it?
ThePlumLineGS	710472553681326080	2016-03-17T14:27:11	deeeebers17 not at all...he's simply deferring to Hillary at that point
ThePlumLineGS	710472402489180160	2016-03-17T14:26:35	beth4158 yeselson that's not the argument at all. he would sincerely have preferred Garland get confirmed earlier; now deferring to HRC
ThePlumLineGS	710472179842940928	2016-03-17T14:25:42	justinsink These things change
ThePlumLineGS	710470901708361728	2016-03-17T14:20:37	johnmcquaid yeselson good point
ThePlumLineGS	710470381480574976	2016-03-17T14:18:33	another interesting possibility 
ThePlumLineGS	710470271258533888	2016-03-17T14:18:07	bmaz Will_Bunch jadler1969 probably true eventually
ThePlumLineGS	710470030555746304	2016-03-17T14:17:09	PeteB2 he could simply argue the election has already happened
ThePlumLineGS	710469940185325568	2016-03-17T14:16:48	markjgreen not really, because the election would have already happened
ThePlumLineGS	710469554175135744	2016-03-17T14:15:16	bmaz Will_Bunch jadler1969 are they doing that? I hear a lot of liberal criticism of him
ThePlumLineGS	710469088544493568	2016-03-17T14:13:25	IpsoFractal dunno...some say he'd never do it
ThePlumLineGS	710468911876214784	2016-03-17T14:12:43	yeselson might be a lot of liberal pressure on him to do this
ThePlumLineGS	710467835517149184	2016-03-17T14:08:26	GrahamDavidA Not really. Remember, this would come *after* election took place
ThePlumLineGS	710467558336565252	2016-03-17T14:07:20	bmaz Will_Bunch jadler1969 Perhaps, but even so, prospect of liberal pressure on him to do this post-big win in Nov is itself interesting
ThePlumLineGS	710467170619281408	2016-03-17T14:05:47	Interesting. Lot of liberals in my feed are saying they'd hope Obama would withdraw Garland if Ds win big in November.
ThePlumLineGS	710466289819586560	2016-03-17T14:02:17	PuestoLoco you aren't following the argument
ThePlumLineGS	710466176904773633	2016-03-17T14:01:51	kcivey bmaz jadler that's certainly possible
ThePlumLineGS	710466040958984195	2016-03-17T14:01:18	130delmar I agree to some degree, it's not entirely clear to me exactly how HRC camp really views it
ThePlumLineGS	710465657985437696	2016-03-17T13:59:47	I suspect this sentiment would be widespread among Dems if Rs try to confirm Garland in lame duck: 
ThePlumLineGS	710465180099080192	2016-03-17T13:57:53	ryanlcooper bmaz jadler1969 just floating a possible scenario
ThePlumLineGS	710465082757615616	2016-03-17T13:57:30	CahnEmily Heh. Well, this is definitely not the outcome Obama would prefer...he'd prefer confirmation now...
ThePlumLineGS	710464893414215680	2016-03-17T13:56:45	OKnox fair point. worth considering, though, that liberal pressure on Obama to withdraw might be fierce, espec after big election win
ThePlumLineGS	710464397295132672	2016-03-17T13:54:46	datadivajf well, I don't think this is the endgame Obama prefers. I think he wants him confirmed now.
ThePlumLineGS	710464243527770113	2016-03-17T13:54:10	OKnox Garland is already causing partisan nuclear war; we get partisan nuclear war no matter who nominee is
ThePlumLineGS	710464060014399488	2016-03-17T13:53:26	ddayen that's not the assumption; he'd prefer Garland but allow Hillary to pick, in this hypothetical
ThePlumLineGS	710463385205399552	2016-03-17T13:50:45	bmaz jadler1969 certainly possible. just floating another possibility.
ThePlumLineGS	710463289441046528	2016-03-17T13:50:22	KennethBaer sam_baker this functions as a way for McConnell to cave: "that dastardly Obama will screw us in lame duck, so..."
ThePlumLineGS	710462992060686336	2016-03-17T13:49:11	markdwags see adler's quote
ThePlumLineGS	710462923479638016	2016-03-17T13:48:55	bmaz it's jadler1969 and there might be heavy pressure from liberals to do this
ThePlumLineGS	710462759360659456	2016-03-17T13:48:16	Huerts31 jadler1969 GOP exactly the point. see the piece. As Adler says, it becomes "game of chicken"

ThePlumLineGS	710462462827560961	2016-03-17T13:47:05	bmaz jadler1969 the argument is that the nominee could be withdrawn at that point
ThePlumLineGS	710462198624161792	2016-03-17T13:46:02	Liberals may pressure Obama to do this ---&gt; 
ThePlumLineGS	710462041920806913	2016-03-17T13:45:25	USANancy there may be heavy liberal pressure to do so
ThePlumLineGS	710461944713580544	2016-03-17T13:45:02	Bjornapoor not sure about that
ThePlumLineGS	710461889441042436	2016-03-17T13:44:48	hugh_brice thanks, appreciate it
ThePlumLineGS	710461777172107264	2016-03-17T13:44:22	sam_baker that's not what they would say. see jadler1969's quote
ThePlumLineGS	710461112555278340	2016-03-17T13:41:43	hugh_brice zzzzz, no end to the rank dissembling.
ThePlumLineGS	710461022272921601	2016-03-17T13:41:22	hugh_brice note that jadler1969 says this could happen. he's not exactly a liberal.
ThePlumLineGS	710460869491212288	2016-03-17T13:40:45	hugh_brice my point is that this is how Rs screw themselves. come on man, this is not difficult
ThePlumLineGS	710460746455506946	2016-03-17T13:40:16	sam_baker ...and Obama would not be withdrawing him on the merits; he'd be bowing to liberal pressure to do so
ThePlumLineGS	710460519543603200	2016-03-17T13:39:22	hugh_brice No, Obama still thinks he's worthy, but defers to the president who has now been elected.
ThePlumLineGS	710460182124437504	2016-03-17T13:38:01	hugh_brice yes, IF they don't act.
ThePlumLineGS	710459991069687808	2016-03-17T13:37:16	sam_baker not true at all. election would have already happened.
ThePlumLineGS	710459920743845888	2016-03-17T13:36:59	hugh_brice But thank you for admitting that it's wrong to base current calculation on hopes of who will win next election, as Rs are doing.
ThePlumLineGS	710459750257971200	2016-03-17T13:36:18	hugh_brice huh? he has nominated someone. he would only withdraw if/when Rs don't act on him.
ThePlumLineGS	710459451988439040	2016-03-17T13:35:07	@mikawirsen why? because people who support Hillary can't have valid opinions?
ThePlumLineGS	710459358539292674	2016-03-17T13:34:45	hugh_brice It is not saying "f-you," it's allowing the already elected new president to choose.
ThePlumLineGS	710459145271566336	2016-03-17T13:33:54	rjemhof it doesn't do that -- election will have already happened
ThePlumLineGS	710459070134820865	2016-03-17T13:33:36	jnelsonw that's a fair point. I mean, the pressure on him from liberals after a big victory to do this might be intense
ThePlumLineGS	710458775417835523	2016-03-17T13:32:26	chrisswartout dunno, I assume so, worth figuring out
ThePlumLineGS	710458498086256640	2016-03-17T13:31:20	hugh_brice of course it wouldn't. they'd have had their chance.
ThePlumLineGS	710458307455160322	2016-03-17T13:30:34	eliasisquith potentially a lot of pressure on Obama from liberals to do so, though.
ThePlumLineGS	710458219873902593	2016-03-17T13:30:13	fordm possibly. but might be a lot of liberal pressure on him to do so at that point.
ThePlumLineGS	710458035551006720	2016-03-17T13:29:30	DARTHKOOLAID no, because at that point, the election would have already happened

ThePlumLineGS	710156075362885632	2016-03-16T17:29:37	lepton939 the point is that they would do this in the lame duck, when the only other option is Hillary picking. do you get that?
ThePlumLineGS	710154742446604288	2016-03-16T17:24:19	lepton939 your response shows clearly that you didn't actually read the piece

ThePlumLineGS	710109138915880961	2016-03-16T14:23:06	brianbeutler mattyglesias worth pondering that reformocons have mostly dropped ball on staking out serious critique of GOP on immigration
ThePlumLineGS	710108764695879681	2016-03-16T14:21:37	Yup, this is now what Trump is saying *explicitly*: 
ThePlumLineGS	710107096906375168	2016-03-16T14:14:59	GOP has no known reason to reject Garland, much less to refuse to even consider him.   If you don't want to govern, get out of government

ThePlumLineGS	710097807668019201	2016-03-16T13:38:04	Trump's new hint of violence at convention represents much bigger threat to GOP than it first appears: 
ThePlumLineGS	710093018146213889	2016-03-16T13:19:03	jpodhoretz Maybe. Or danger is Clinton may pick someone more liberal with Senate majority behind her if GOP sticks with current plan.

ThePlumLineGS	709501210806583298	2016-03-14T22:07:25	mlow29 utterly baseless suggestion, rooted in zero evidence

ThePlumLineGS	709443781620318209	2016-03-14T18:19:13	law_comedy yes, but arguably, not voting at all on nominee constitutes withholding consent (which Senate can do if it pleases) 1/2

ThePlumLineGS	708994463096545280	2016-03-13T12:33:47	ggreenwald emptywheel Sure. But even if that were true, it could also be true that they'd prefer Kasich to her
ThePlumLineGS	708994267537141764	2016-03-13T12:33:00	billeniumbeach If you really think Wall Street would prefer Hillary to a mainstream Republican president, we'll have to agree to disagree
ThePlumLineGS	708994106320625665	2016-03-13T12:32:22	ggreenwald emptywheel I think they'd prefer Kasich, but I can't prove that (giving not a good metric, b/c Wall St betting Kasich cant win)

ThePlumLineGS	708411636135100416	2016-03-11T21:57:50	dws3665 well, she's retracted now, which is good. But initial comments seemed political
ThePlumLineGS	708410880434765826	2016-03-11T21:54:50	dws3665 it was not a direct comparison, it was meant to highlight her opportunism on Reagans in both cases
ThePlumLineGS	708408825318084608	2016-03-11T21:46:40	dws3665 huh? I'm pointing out the inconsistency here

ThePlumLineGS	708382147514601472	2016-03-11T20:00:39	Good SimonMaloy take on the "cruel ironies" at the heart of the NeverTrump movement: 
ThePlumLineGS	708378586995150848	2016-03-11T19:46:30	I'm so old I can remember when the Hillary campaign in 2008 slammed Obama for praising Reagan  
ThePlumLineGS	708376010731950081	2016-03-11T19:36:16	If big donors get back Trump, he "will probably argue that they don’t control him; he controls them" ThePlumLineGS: 
ThePlumLineGS	708374819394424832	2016-03-11T19:31:32	Hah. Literally seconds ago I posted something speculating this might be their excuse:  
ThePlumLineGS	708374362487971840	2016-03-11T19:29:43	Big GOP donors are looking to get on the Trump Train, a new report says. Here's how the dance will work:

ThePlumLineGS	708353093734440960	2016-03-11T18:05:12	fleetadmiralj hah, good luck with this stance if Trump tightens grip on nomination and Obama rolls out a nominee

ThePlumLineGS	708350657154195458	2016-03-11T17:55:31	SteveKaszycki RichLowry I read this as giving up on Rubio being able to do it even at convention. Is that right, Rich?
ThePlumLineGS	708350132987797504	2016-03-11T17:53:26	It looks like RichLowry and National Review think Rubio is done, even if he wins FL:  
ThePlumLineGS	708348683121762304	2016-03-11T17:47:41	Dave_Loren that's important, too, but you'll see a whole different level of battering that Trump will be subjected to
ThePlumLineGS	708347932555272192	2016-03-11T17:44:42	Dave_Loren my whole point is that he's running into a buzz saw with the *general election audience,* not with his supporters
ThePlumLineGS	708345254043320322	2016-03-11T17:34:03	Will Donald Trump's self-proclaimed large hands soon be facing elect-ile dysfunction?  ThePlumLineGS thinks so:

ThePlumLineGS	708337501870628865	2016-03-11T17:03:15	Still not getting this divide-up-the-states strategy. Why would voters deliberately not vote their preference? Seems unlikely.

ThePlumLineGS	708316213613608961	2016-03-11T15:38:39	GlennThrush Cmon, we all were guilty at one point or another of not taking him seriously enough and/or writing about him for clicks
ThePlumLineGS	708315438619430912	2016-03-11T15:35:35	GlennThrush we are in some ways all complicit
ThePlumLineGS	708314360381370368	2016-03-11T15:31:18	So let's stop making him what he is, then. 
ThePlumLineGS	708300478694690816	2016-03-11T14:36:08	How Trump will face a "buzz saw" in the general, when (if?) he faces an opponent who doesn't talk nonsense on policy 
ThePlumLineGS	708299163004510208	2016-03-11T14:30:54	yep. his unfavorables are thru the roof and he hasn't even faced a smart, sustained attack campaign  
ThePlumLineGS	708298122900930560	2016-03-11T14:26:46	Truer words never written. 
ThePlumLineGS	708297368593158144	2016-03-11T14:23:46	Trump's been seduced by soft GOP primary debate. He's gonna run into buzz saw of reality soon enough: 
ThePlumLineGS	708296978950713344	2016-03-11T14:22:13	IFThunder if you read the piece, you'll see I'm talking about the general election
ThePlumLineGS	708295970690306048	2016-03-11T14:18:13	GOP debate only revealed how *little* policy scrutiny Trump has endured. He's about to run into a buzz saw: 
ThePlumLineGS	708032198792896512	2016-03-10T20:50:05	56% of GOP voters want to raise taxes on people earning &gt; $250,000. 100% of GOP candidates want to cut those taxes. 
ThePlumLineGS	708277613018652672	2016-03-11T13:05:16	Godfather of individual mandate is last hope for stopping only GOP candidate who doesn't think it's pure evil. 
ThePlumLineGS	708275257325527040	2016-03-11T12:55:55	On a more serious note, I think stuff like this is an indication some pundits will treat Trump as basically normal. 
ThePlumLineGS	708271320518230016	2016-03-11T12:40:16	owillis yeah
ThePlumLineGS	708270368075718657	2016-03-11T12:36:29	owillis What's the fix, do you think?
ThePlumLineGS	708266133485445120	2016-03-11T12:19:39	ByronYork Serious Q: Is there any sense that maybe "generational choice" isn't a good message to struggling working class Rs?
ThePlumLineGS	708265939100442624	2016-03-11T12:18:53	asoukuptx probably right. see first graf
ThePlumLineGS	708264103622615040	2016-03-11T12:11:35	White voters like *their* entitlements, blame immigrants for changing "their" country. 
ThePlumLineGS	708262954421121025	2016-03-11T12:07:01	Exactly my point. 
ThePlumLineGS	708258779377373184	2016-03-11T11:50:26	Trump's combo of nativism/protecting entitlements works among R voters, new study finds:  
ThePlumLineGS	708138132793901056	2016-03-11T03:51:02	Trump: I know the system is bought-and-paid-for, because I've bought and paid for politicians myself.  This is his explicit message.
ThePlumLineGS	708136671276044288	2016-03-11T03:45:13	Cruz just stuck a knife in Rubio and the divide-up-the-states-among-those-who-can-win-them strategy.
ThePlumLineGS	708135856075362305	2016-03-11T03:41:59	ThePlumLineGS the ultimate circular argument
ThePlumLineGS	708132881395154946	2016-03-11T03:30:10	Rubio: We can't act on climate, b/c other countries won't do their part.  Rubio, on global climate deal: 
ThePlumLineGS	708130433830100992	2016-03-11T03:20:26	Rubio sounds very reasonable about climate, until he derides...  "passing law in Washington to change the weather."
ThePlumLineGS	708130146868457472	2016-03-11T03:19:18	BresPolitico really important aspect of Trump's message is he's pro *good* dealmaking, not anti-dealmaking
ThePlumLineGS	708129849857204224	2016-03-11T03:18:07	philipaklein Yes. He's having a very good night. A lot of ground to make up, though, if polls are right (if)
ThePlumLineGS	708129442552553472	2016-03-11T03:16:30	philipaklein explain?
ThePlumLineGS	708129187878604800	2016-03-11T03:15:29	bmaz agree
ThePlumLineGS	708129030894125056	2016-03-11T03:14:52	notcharchar I didn't say "serious," I said, "real" :)
ThePlumLineGS	708128829311684612	2016-03-11T03:14:03	dansheehan yeah
ThePlumLineGS	708128774274093056	2016-03-11T03:13:50	sluggahjells there are degrees of clownery
ThePlumLineGS	708127963150204928	2016-03-11T03:10:37	Ds should note that the Republicans are actually having a real debate.  Can't count on GOP side being a clown show forever.
ThePlumLineGS	708127504993804288	2016-03-11T03:08:48	kristina_wong thanks
ThePlumLineGS	708126961080668161	2016-03-11T03:06:38	Has Trump just been more specific than any other GOP candidate about how many ground troops he'd send in against ISIS?
ThePlumLineGS	708125806506205185	2016-03-11T03:02:03	BresPolitico Maybe Trump is the optimist in this race!
ThePlumLineGS	708125518785339392	2016-03-11T03:00:54	Would be fascinating to know how the Trump/Rubio positions on Israel (such as they are) poll among GOP primary voters.
ThePlumLineGS	708123026559279104	2016-03-11T02:51:00	Glad to see Rubio endorse idea that presidents must weigh words carefully to avoid alienating allies and creating more terrorists.
ThePlumLineGS	708120480524472320	2016-03-11T02:40:53	"It's not free trade, it's stupid trade."  Can't be overstated how key this idea is to Trump's whole approach: 
ThePlumLineGS	708119774014926848	2016-03-11T02:38:05	Yes. I'm pretty sure brianbeutler was first to identify the collective-action problem Rs faced w/Trump. 
ThePlumLineGS	708119271482789888	2016-03-11T02:36:05	When Trump says, "I can't believe how civil it is up here"  he really means  "these wimps and losers have been crushed under my boot"
ThePlumLineGS	708118149946855424	2016-03-11T02:31:37	narents yeah
ThePlumLineGS	708117623515582468	2016-03-11T02:29:32	"The numbers don't add up."  -- candidate who pledges Balanced Budget Amendment + deficit-busting tax cuts, including on wealthiest
ThePlumLineGS	708116618719662081	2016-03-11T02:25:32	Trump once again pledges not to touch Social Security. New study shows this resonates with his GOP backers: 
ThePlumLineGS	708115580587515905	2016-03-11T02:21:25	President Cruz will have a busy Day One:  Scrap Iran deal Scrap global climate deal Cancel all of Obama's exec actions End Common Core
ThePlumLineGS	708115159810772992	2016-03-11T02:19:44	ScottChalleen agree
ThePlumLineGS	708113818833051648	2016-03-11T02:14:25	Calm, emotionally stable, presidential Trump is a lot scarier than narcissistic, rambling, manic-up-and-down Trump.
ThePlumLineGS	708113523960893445	2016-03-11T02:13:14	alexhazanov I don't think he has a good chance of winning the general.
ThePlumLineGS	708112846517772288	2016-03-11T02:10:33	But at a gut level, I imagine his “I’ll turn my greed outward for America” line has broad appeal.
ThePlumLineGS	708113261443551233	2016-03-11T02:12:12	hangingsliders I will!
ThePlumLineGS	708113194066288642	2016-03-11T02:11:56	alexhazanov Right, because the fact that he's on track to win the GOP nomination says nothing about whether his approach works.
ThePlumLineGS	708112827358248961	2016-03-11T02:10:28	hangingsliders thanks! too kind
ThePlumLineGS	708112408850653184	2016-03-11T02:08:49	Yeah. Attacks on him as a scummy businessman may lead voters to say, "cool -- be scum on my behalf, please." 
ThePlumLineGS	708111957333774336	2016-03-11T02:07:01	Yes! I'm a monster, but I'm YOUR monster. 
ThePlumLineGS	708111543376977920	2016-03-11T02:05:22	Trump's message: I get how the scam works from the inside, and I'm here to bust up the elites' party.
ThePlumLineGS	708109863512104961	2016-03-11T01:58:42	Not really. Making it even worse, there's a wishful-thinking quality to it. 
ThePlumLineGS	708109170004852737	2016-03-11T01:55:56	Curious to see how Cruz goes about discrediting Rubio's inevitable claim that voting for him is only way to deny Trump Florida
ThePlumLineGS	708108906753597440	2016-03-11T01:54:54	sgw94 yeah, would be interesting if he were pressed on it, for sure
ThePlumLineGS	708108225338601473	2016-03-11T01:52:11	JBenKelley Hah, I followed Trump closely in the late 90s, as a reporter in NYC. He was entertaining. He was easy to get on the phone.
ThePlumLineGS	708107977564282880	2016-03-11T01:51:12	sgw94 I doubt it. He's only saying the party will support the nominee when he has won nomination. Could be through contested conv.
ThePlumLineGS	708107081912598529	2016-03-11T01:47:38	Reince confirms he is not a member of NeverTrump.
ThePlumLineGS	708106648599003136	2016-03-11T01:45:55	JBenKelley Sure, of course. I just thought that was a bit of a Trumpian tactic.
ThePlumLineGS	708106501529968641	2016-03-11T01:45:20	BlameBigGovt Well, yes. I can see that happening. I wonder if he's going to lay off any attacks on his character (eg unfit for presidency)
ThePlumLineGS	708105330778107904	2016-03-11T01:40:41	joanmccarter Hah, true. A couple polls today put it in high single digits
ThePlumLineGS	708105225383645186	2016-03-11T01:40:16	BlameBigGovt so, he's not gonna do that?
ThePlumLineGS	708104743810371585	2016-03-11T01:38:21	joanmccarter Hah. I don't know -- I would not rule out a surprise Rubio win there!
ThePlumLineGS	708104587044114433	2016-03-11T01:37:44	joanmccarter if he loses Florida
ThePlumLineGS	708104284932612097	2016-03-11T01:36:32	Wondering whether Rubio will go with a pristine high-road approach tonight, so he can exit with dignity (if he does lose).
ThePlumLineGS	708101826651013120	2016-03-11T01:26:46	JBenKelley 
ThePlumLineGS	708080135250042882	2016-03-11T00:00:34	Ben Carson presser endorsing Trump almost seems designed to drown out any negative news coming out of tonight's debate

ThePlumLineGS	708066315257380865	2016-03-10T23:05:39	Striking: Cruz Super PAC is so sure Rubio will lose FL that it's not spending there, teddyschleifer reports:

ThePlumLineGS	708063611512594432	2016-03-10T22:54:54	ForecasterEnten Yeah, figured. FWIW, this just popped 
ThePlumLineGS	708063303348690944	2016-03-10T22:53:41	Anyone know if Opinion Savvy is a reputable pollster?
ThePlumLineGS	708059564416040960	2016-03-10T22:38:49	Transcript of Lewandowski/Fields incident, via Hadas_Gold, seems to leave no doubt as to what happened: 
ThePlumLineGS	708056713019191296	2016-03-10T22:27:30	EdinaMNguy no need to do that
ThePlumLineGS	708055743753297921	2016-03-10T22:23:39	JosephMainez yeah, or the opposite of that.
ThePlumLineGS	708055384280449024	2016-03-10T22:22:13	This is not going to end well, is it.
ThePlumLineGS	708054418487382018	2016-03-10T22:18:23	Clarifying this. I don't mean to draw an equivalence. My point was this was a kind of Trumpian belittling tactic. 
ThePlumLineGS	708053470868324352	2016-03-10T22:14:37	samfbiddle sure. I don't mean to draw a direct equivalence
ThePlumLineGS	708053093670395906	2016-03-10T22:13:07	samfbiddle no, my point was that this was kind of a Trumpian belittling aside
ThePlumLineGS	708052503171047425	2016-03-10T22:10:46	Good bterris look at the, shall we say, heavy handed tactics of the Trump inner circle: 
ThePlumLineGS	708048451788005376	2016-03-10T21:54:40	igorbobic I'm kind of trolling. But not crazy about mockery of that
ThePlumLineGS	708047888983715840	2016-03-10T21:52:26	mckaycoppins I didn't say you were chortling!
ThePlumLineGS	708047546237714432	2016-03-10T21:51:04	Area people who profess to be horrified by Trumpism gleefully chortle at this ---&gt; 
ThePlumLineGS	708046252882075648	2016-03-10T21:45:56	Sounds like the sort of thing Trump himself might casually mention 
ThePlumLineGS	708045829299441666	2016-03-10T21:44:15	@AmKonDotNet I don't know -- I think Hillary has been subjected to some pretty tough scrutiny, which is as it should be
ThePlumLineGS	707950359432601600	2016-03-10T15:24:53	The most important takeaway, of course, is I have a podcast, and you should subscribe to it.  
ThePlumLineGS	708045412423352320	2016-03-10T21:42:35	@AmKonDotNet have written a bunch of pieces questioning Hillary and Trump
ThePlumLineGS	708040629729804288	2016-03-10T21:23:35	XLProfessor interesting thanks
ThePlumLineGS	708039444587094016	2016-03-10T21:18:52	Why Republican establishment doesn't know what to do about Trump: 
ThePlumLineGS	708034243784531968	2016-03-10T20:58:13	Everyone (apart from elites and Ayn Rand fanboys) opposes cutting entitlements. 
ThePlumLineGS	708031747917811712	2016-03-10T20:48:17	steven06639 definitely important reason
ThePlumLineGS	708031363899891712	2016-03-10T20:46:46	Why attacks on Trump fail: Rs who back him are nativist and oppose cutting entitlements, a new study finds: 
ThePlumLineGS	708029826536509440	2016-03-10T20:40:39	Also in this piece: This is the real reason why GOP attacks on Trump miss the mark: 
ThePlumLineGS	708029452232556544	2016-03-10T20:39:10	LDoren yeah, I think I agree. check out the argument in the piece
ThePlumLineGS	708026599355117568	2016-03-10T20:27:50	colinkalmbacher YeaYouRite thanks
ThePlumLineGS	708025485918343168	2016-03-10T20:23:24	colinkalmbacher YeaYouRite The point I'm making is that immigration lawyers can help shed light on the Const Qs. True, or not?
ThePlumLineGS	708024943070617602	2016-03-10T20:21:15	colinkalmbacher YeaYouRite right, I acknowledge that. I'm just saying that immig lawyers have something important to tell us here.
ThePlumLineGS	708023840677437440	2016-03-10T20:16:52	colinkalmbacher please explain to YeaYouRite that what is in the INA is relevant to the Constitutional Q at issue.
ThePlumLineGS	708023381443084288	2016-03-10T20:15:03	YeaYouRite You are the one who is confused about it, friend.
ThePlumLineGS	708020978392166400	2016-03-10T20:05:30	colinkalmbacher YeaYouRite He is saying that immigration lawyers' knowledge has no relevance to this discussion; I'm saying it does.
ThePlumLineGS	708020842173743104	2016-03-10T20:04:57	YeaYouRite That's fine -- this is why what immigration lawyers have to say about this topic is relevant. They know what's in the INA!
ThePlumLineGS	708019917916921856	2016-03-10T20:01:17	YeaYouRite I don't understand your objection. Core point is, admin is citing INA as conferring the discretion on the exec to implement DAPA
ThePlumLineGS	708019644758671364	2016-03-10T20:00:12	colinkalmbacher Isn't one of the arguments the admin is making that the INA gives exec the discretion to implement DACA and DAPA?
ThePlumLineGS	708017862187864064	2016-03-10T19:53:07	YeaYouRite read from page 42 on. that's the part where it talks about the INA as the source of the exec's enforcement discretion
ThePlumLineGS	708015836158681088	2016-03-10T19:45:04	YeaYouRite will get to this as soon as I can, tied up
ThePlumLineGS	708014346014728192	2016-03-10T19:39:09	YeaYouRite got a link to the brief handy?
ThePlumLineGS	708014109607010304	2016-03-10T19:38:12	YeaYouRite colinkalmbacher you are wrong, no matter how many times you "explain" it
ThePlumLineGS	708013438103109632	2016-03-10T19:35:32	colinkalmbacher I recognize all that. There is standing, admin law Q and also what's in the INA. Right?
ThePlumLineGS	708010148393050113	2016-03-10T19:22:28	bmaz sbagen yeselson It's possible. I hope not.
ThePlumLineGS	708009620120461313	2016-03-10T19:20:22	bmaz yeselson sbagen Right. I think that's fair. Sanders goes a good deal farther. A bit reckless IMHO.
ThePlumLineGS	708009078946144262	2016-03-10T19:18:13	sbagen bmaz yeselson yes. that's the problem.
ThePlumLineGS	708008972452818948	2016-03-10T19:17:47	bmaz yeselson sbagen humor me. as someone who knows the law, do you think that would survive the courts?
ThePlumLineGS	708008685302374400	2016-03-10T19:16:39	sbagen YeaYouRite thank you.
ThePlumLineGS	708008368309460993	2016-03-10T19:15:23	bmaz yeselson sbagen Do you think Sanders should be arguing that DAPA can be expanded to cover 9 million? Would that survive courts?
ThePlumLineGS	708008134099542017	2016-03-10T19:14:27	sbagen YeaYouRite Sam, does the Constitutional question turn in part on what the statute says?
ThePlumLineGS	708007093278806016	2016-03-10T19:10:19	bmaz yeselson sbagen it's also deeply puzzling to hit Clinton for overpromising on this, but not hit Sanders for the same.
ThePlumLineGS	708006844871135232	2016-03-10T19:09:20	bmaz yeselson sbagen There is an enormous difference between asserting enforcement priorities and vowing to expand DAPA. Enormous.
ThePlumLineGS	708006448874311680	2016-03-10T19:07:46	YeaYouRite sbagen just go read the administration's arguments in its legal papers. their case is rooted in what the statute says
ThePlumLineGS	708005763269132290	2016-03-10T19:05:02	bmaz yeselson sbagen I agree she should be pressed for further clarification. But she didn't say what Sanders says. That's just factual.
ThePlumLineGS	708005444242038784	2016-03-10T19:03:46	bmaz yeselson sbagen sanders has *explicitly* said he'd expand DAPA to cover 9 million. Clinton has not said that.
ThePlumLineGS	708005349899501569	2016-03-10T19:03:24	bmaz yeselson sbagen disingenuous. in what universe does "stop deportations" automatically = "here are work permits"?
ThePlumLineGS	708005209625198592	2016-03-10T19:02:50	YeaYouRite sbagen the statutes absolutely do set parameters for discretion in immigration law. and the dispute turns on what they are.
ThePlumLineGS	708004727183831041	2016-03-10T19:00:55	yeselson bmaz sbagen As I tried to explain, that could merely have been reassertion of Morton Memo: 
ThePlumLineGS	708004418193592320	2016-03-10T18:59:42	bmaz sbagen yeselson No, actually, she does not quite get there. But she should be pressed for further clarification.
ThePlumLineGS	708004177084022785	2016-03-10T18:58:44	YeaYouRite sbagen yeselson That's false. Admin's argument is that the statute delegates the discretion to the exec that he's exercising
ThePlumLineGS	708003581799112704	2016-03-10T18:56:22	YeaYouRite sbagen yeselson I give up, man.
ThePlumLineGS	708003381432995840	2016-03-10T18:55:34	YeaYouRite sbagen yeselson Just go ask a Constitutional expert: What relevance does the statute have to the Const question here?
ThePlumLineGS	708003259018059776	2016-03-10T18:55:05	YeaYouRite sbagen yeselson But in the statute, Congress loosely defines the discretion of the executive. That's central to Q here.
ThePlumLineGS	708002760634056704	2016-03-10T18:53:06	YeaYouRite sbagen yeselson The relevant part of the statute resides in what enforcement discretion Congress delegated to executive.
ThePlumLineGS	708002487349944320	2016-03-10T18:52:01	YeaYouRite sbagen yeselson Dude. The resolution of the Const question turns partly on what discretion *the statute* gives the executive.
ThePlumLineGS	708002131572297731	2016-03-10T18:50:36	YeaYouRite sbagen I'll just refer you back to the previous tweets.
ThePlumLineGS	708001835152515072	2016-03-10T18:49:26	sbagen YeaYouRite yeselson bingo. thank you.
ThePlumLineGS	708001733784576001	2016-03-10T18:49:02	YeaYouRite sbagen yeselson The question of whether the exec faithfully executed law turns partly on what the law itself says
ThePlumLineGS	708001403852165121	2016-03-10T18:47:43	YeaYouRite sbagen yeselson If you read the administration's arguments, you'll see constant references to immigration statute
ThePlumLineGS	708001127464304640	2016-03-10T18:46:37	YeaYouRite sbagen yeselson nope, false
ThePlumLineGS	708001019595198466	2016-03-10T18:46:11	YeaYouRite That is *part* of the dispute, but not *all* of it. A key question is, What discretion did Congress give to executive?
ThePlumLineGS	708000885578866688	2016-03-10T18:45:39	sbagen YeaYouRite yeselson He doesn't think what's in immigration statute is relevant to this dispute. was hoping you'd explain it to him
ThePlumLineGS	708000111125725184	2016-03-10T18:42:35	YeaYouRite Again, a controlling question is how much discretion Congress gave to the executive, which is a Q about what's in *immig law*
ThePlumLineGS	707999942456053760	2016-03-10T18:41:54	dooglives my experience has been that pieces showing skepticism of Clinton are not met with the same backlash. speaking for myself only
ThePlumLineGS	707999721860808704	2016-03-10T18:41:02	sbagen yeselson Sam, would you mind explaining to YeaYouRite that what's in immigration law is relevant to this debate?
ThePlumLineGS	707999458856968192	2016-03-10T18:39:59	yeselson sbagen Right. She could have merely been reasserting enforcement priorities, as opposed to saying she'd expand DAPA
ThePlumLineGS	707999294150811648	2016-03-10T18:39:20	YeaYouRite Because you say immigration lawyers have no relevant expertise. Flat out wrong. This is partly about what's in immig law.
ThePlumLineGS	707998980039446528	2016-03-10T18:38:05	sbagen yeselson Right. Sanders is saying clearly he'd expand DAPA. Clinton not saying that, I think
ThePlumLineGS	707998843036639232	2016-03-10T18:37:32	YeaYouRite I have talked to more of them than you have.
ThePlumLineGS	707998733510819840	2016-03-10T18:37:06	dooglives Okay, cool. But can you remember this the next time? :)
ThePlumLineGS	707998547669598208	2016-03-10T18:36:22	yeselson sbagen well, not clear to me. I feel like she didn't say whether she's talking about expanding DAPA. clarification required
ThePlumLineGS	707998441532747776	2016-03-10T18:35:57	dooglives Let me be clear: I'm talking only about handful of people who shout down any skepticism towards Sanders. And I'm having fun.
ThePlumLineGS	707998258472292353	2016-03-10T18:35:13	YeaYouRite I don't understand. What is your basis for saying you should be taken seriously on the topic?
ThePlumLineGS	707998179678150656	2016-03-10T18:34:54	dooglives Oh, come on, I'm not smearing an entire group, I'm talking about that "few online," and it's only in fun anyway.
ThePlumLineGS	707997952086818816	2016-03-10T18:34:00	sbagen yeselson Exactly.
ThePlumLineGS	707997892175380480	2016-03-10T18:33:46	YeaYouRite pretty funny that you are telling others to call experts while lecturing people about the topic yourself.
ThePlumLineGS	707997639015530496	2016-03-10T18:32:45	dooglives Look, why not just admit that you don't want Sanders subjected to any skepticism, and defend it?
ThePlumLineGS	707997487253086208	2016-03-10T18:32:09	sbagen yeselson This is exactly what is so galling about it.
ThePlumLineGS	707997368856276992	2016-03-10T18:31:41	Exactly. cc YeaYouRite 
ThePlumLineGS	707997044795969537	2016-03-10T18:30:24	YeaYouRite Not really. If you are not employing the same level of resources towards enforcement as before, it isn't discretion anymore
ThePlumLineGS	707996772828889088	2016-03-10T18:29:19	dooglives Not crying, pointing and laughing.
ThePlumLineGS	707996584571752448	2016-03-10T18:28:34	YeaYouRite Because one is prosecutorial discretion, and the other isn't.
ThePlumLineGS	707996425418833921	2016-03-10T18:27:56	The Sanders strike force is back to smite down anyone who expresses skepticism of both Bernie and Hillary, as opposed to just Hillary!
ThePlumLineGS	707996283143888896	2016-03-10T18:27:22	YeaYouRite zzzzzzz
ThePlumLineGS	707995729474797568	2016-03-10T18:25:10	Bernie and Hillary made deeply ridiculous promises about immigration last night. Does that matter? 
ThePlumLineGS	707991517164642304	2016-03-10T18:08:26	ScottPaterno okay
ThePlumLineGS	707990023581384704	2016-03-10T18:02:30	Great jonathanchait piece on how Rs can't attack Trump tax plan:   Romney proves it: 
ThePlumLineGS	707980685785567236	2016-03-10T17:25:23	Here's my assessment of the prospects for Trump's general election makeover: 
ThePlumLineGS	707982846414094336	2016-03-10T17:33:58	Good Q. Did Rubio give Lee the green light here? 
ThePlumLineGS	707982258100183040	2016-03-10T17:31:38	KevinMFeeney fleetadmiralj good point. Q did show Rubio losing ground
ThePlumLineGS	707981204956565504	2016-03-10T17:27:27	whstancil agree
ThePlumLineGS	707981057895833600	2016-03-10T17:26:52	fleetadmiralj the ones showing double digits are a day are two more recent than the WaPo poll, FWIW
ThePlumLineGS	707980735211249665	2016-03-10T17:25:35	fleetadmiralj Not sure, there would have to be some reason for believing these polls rather than the ones that have Trump up double digits
ThePlumLineGS	707980442486624256	2016-03-10T17:24:25	Can Trump do an extreme general election makeover? It's not impossible. paulwaldman1 explains: 
ThePlumLineGS	707978386052878336	2016-03-10T17:16:15	Worth noting that Suffolk poll is more recent: Taken March 7-9. 
ThePlumLineGS	707976995615993856	2016-03-10T17:10:43	PatMcMahonDC one would hope so. it's his home state and he's devoting everything he has to it.
ThePlumLineGS	707976528278249473	2016-03-10T17:08:52	New Suffolk poll of FL:  Trump 36 Rubio 27    New WaPo poll of FL:  Trump 38 Rubio 31  
ThePlumLineGS	707975954384158721	2016-03-10T17:06:35	davidpaleologos Is this poll online yet?
ThePlumLineGS	707975045843447808	2016-03-10T17:02:59	jbarro FWIW, since we discussed this yesterday, I tried to get to the bottom of it here: 
ThePlumLineGS	707973536468615169	2016-03-10T16:56:59	New Reuters/Ipsos poll of GOP voters nationally:  Trump 41 Cruz 24 Rubio 13 Kasich 13  Pollster email: "Cruz has rallied past Rubio"
ThePlumLineGS	707961677975789568	2016-03-10T16:09:51	Useful mmurraypolitics road map showing why Trump/Clinton may not clinch nominations anytime soon: 
ThePlumLineGS	707960098359013378	2016-03-10T16:03:35	johnwow agreed
ThePlumLineGS	707959350552305665	2016-03-10T16:00:37	We gotta be better than this. No need for either of them to make empty promises/pander this way. 
ThePlumLineGS	707959950870515713	2016-03-10T16:03:00	LPDonovan WilliamNyikuli Right. Does it renew talk that Rubio is the guy to get the nom at a contested convention, though?
ThePlumLineGS	707959252107862019	2016-03-10T16:00:13	johnwow point being?
ThePlumLineGS	707958505832108032	2016-03-10T15:57:15	LPDonovan yeah, seems fair. also the Michigan polling debacle more of a reason to be skeptical that we know anything...
ThePlumLineGS	707958130634825729	2016-03-10T15:55:46	LPDonovan placing stock in a model that puts him down nine in his home state doesn't seem like it speaks to his strength...
ThePlumLineGS	707957123058167808	2016-03-10T15:51:46	LPDonovan seems likely it's somewhere in between the two, no?
ThePlumLineGS	707956875803959296	2016-03-10T15:50:47	AndrewHurd hah thanks
ThePlumLineGS	707956665568665600	2016-03-10T15:49:56	AndrewHurd Come on man. Here: a lot of what Trump says is bullshit. Okay?
ThePlumLineGS	707955922413473792	2016-03-10T15:46:59	AndrewHurd Heh. have used the words "xenophobia" and "demagoguery" regularly
ThePlumLineGS	707954761220399106	2016-03-10T15:42:22	I'm a shill for Republicans now, apparently. 
ThePlumLineGS	707954698540683265	2016-03-10T15:42:07	AndrewHurd Are you kidding me? I've been doing that ever since Trump entered the race.
ThePlumLineGS	707952733169586176	2016-03-10T15:34:19	Sorry, but the Bernie-Hillary immigration exchange in Miami was loaded up with bullshit promises: 
ThePlumLineGS	707952148227690498	2016-03-10T15:31:59	CGasparino thanks
ThePlumLineGS	707950924824756224	2016-03-10T15:27:08	CGasparino do they believe he has any way of getting the nomination at a contested convention?
ThePlumLineGS	707950485806964736	2016-03-10T15:25:23	CGasparino thanks much, interesting reporting!
ThePlumLineGS	707950216784248832	2016-03-10T15:24:19	CGasparino interesting, thanks. they still want him out before Tuesday?
ThePlumLineGS	707949521662287873	2016-03-10T15:21:33	CGasparino anything new on what you reported last night?
ThePlumLineGS	707944367378399235	2016-03-10T15:01:04	Both campaigns should be pressed for clarifications about their positions.  
ThePlumLineGS	707944568822611968	2016-03-10T15:01:52	MarkGisleson Yes, this is a piece about one specific issue that matters a lot. Get back to me when you have a real objection.
ThePlumLineGS	707944190316048384	2016-03-10T15:00:22	conncarroll Bernie's promises are bigger than Hillary's, though
ThePlumLineGS	707943909184442368	2016-03-10T14:59:15	ManerdM from Central America...it says that in there
ThePlumLineGS	707943252641636352	2016-03-10T14:56:39	MarkGisleson Yeah, it's crazy to hold them accountable for trying to get them to explain how they'd meet their big promises.
ThePlumLineGS	707940025984536576	2016-03-10T14:43:49	Spot on analysis of the immigration portion of the DemDebate in Miami. 
ThePlumLineGS	707942012578865152	2016-03-10T14:51:43	Also: Another wave of migrants is expected this summer. It will go BOOM in the presidential race: 
ThePlumLineGS	707940298723352576	2016-03-10T14:44:54	ktumulty Thanks! Great debate last night, congrats!
ThePlumLineGS	707938861922525184	2016-03-10T14:39:12	The Bernie-Hillary immigration slugfest in Miami was a big, hot mess. I try to sort it out here: 
ThePlumLineGS	707937905159892992	2016-03-10T14:35:24	Bernie and Hillary made big immigration promises last night. You shouldn't believe either of them: 
ThePlumLineGS	707915684429369344	2016-03-10T13:07:06	sgw94 It's a big outrage and a big overreach...now that Hillary has sorta said the same thing
ThePlumLineGS	707914888480497664	2016-03-10T13:03:56	For anyone interested, here is the immigration promise that Bernie has made for months (repeated last night): 
ThePlumLineGS	707913356162830336	2016-03-10T12:57:51	Sanders has been pushing no-deportation line for months: Yet it's only deemed outrageous by media now that Hillary has edged towards it.
ThePlumLineGS	707897151309930497	2016-03-10T11:53:27	If so, Rs are going to get hit by more TV ads like this one starring Trump:  
ThePlumLineGS	707779743282819072	2016-03-10T04:06:55	kalhan true, but Sanders has already made this promise:  gotta run...back tomorrow
ThePlumLineGS	707777341221642241	2016-03-10T03:57:22	Don't worry, Ann, Donald Trump will make America great again. 
ThePlumLineGS	707776911913705472	2016-03-10T03:55:40	BuzzFeedBen still unclear precisely what she promised. But we know for sure that Sanders has already promised it :)
ThePlumLineGS	707776516365656065	2016-03-10T03:54:06	seungminkim BuzzFeedBen jbarro Right. But if I understand this right, Clinton would not expand eligibility for DAPA, just smooth process
ThePlumLineGS	707776293803270144	2016-03-10T03:53:12	Clinton/Sanders deportation comments need clarification. Not clear if they're saying all undocumenteds w/o record would get DAPA.
ThePlumLineGS	707775571749675008	2016-03-10T03:50:20	manyoso Senate bill iss where I'm getting the number...I'm not sure what the hard number of all w/o a record would be
ThePlumLineGS	707775058702438400	2016-03-10T03:48:18	manyoso the nine million is a reference to all who would be legalized under Senate bill
ThePlumLineGS	707774642837180416	2016-03-10T03:46:39	seungminkim BuzzFeedBen jbarro So, couldn't she be basically reasserting Morton memo, w/o saying, "here's DAPA for all of you"?
ThePlumLineGS	707774082897596416	2016-03-10T03:44:25	BuzzFeedBen seungminkim jbarro Yeah. Question is whether she's saying all of them would get formal deportation relief and work permits
ThePlumLineGS	707773800000126981	2016-03-10T03:43:18	jbarro seungminkim evoinvitro depends...see last tweet
ThePlumLineGS	707773695855632385	2016-03-10T03:42:53	seungminkim evoinvitro jbarro Think Q is whether she's merely reasserting broad enforcement priorities or saying she'd expand DAPA to all
ThePlumLineGS	707772628266831872	2016-03-10T03:38:39	seungminkim jbarro heh, thanks
ThePlumLineGS	707772537225220098	2016-03-10T03:38:17	jbarro seungminkim I think you're right. If so, it's a new position for her. Not for Sanders, though
ThePlumLineGS	707772381612347396	2016-03-10T03:37:40	seungminkim jbarro wait, what? ;)
ThePlumLineGS	707772089722413056	2016-03-10T03:36:30	jbarro seungminkim Yeah. I think maybe lines got crossed between discussion of unaccompanied kids and fate of broader population
ThePlumLineGS	707771782833557504	2016-03-10T03:35:17	seungminkim jbarro Here's my Q: Did Clinton go quite as far as Sanders did? Think she might have stopped just short. Need to see transript
ThePlumLineGS	707771495163023360	2016-03-10T03:34:08	seungminkim jbarro Agree -- comprehensive legislative reform is the way to go! I don't think they should be promising DACA for 9 million
ThePlumLineGS	707770942630600704	2016-03-10T03:31:57	jbarro to be clear, I'm skeptical of the promise of deportation relief for 9 million. Not sure it holds up in court
ThePlumLineGS	707770492703395841	2016-03-10T03:30:09	jbarro well, so does executive action...basic idea is, Class A gets deportation relief, and we focus *harder* on deporting other classes
ThePlumLineGS	707770133163470848	2016-03-10T03:28:44	jbarro Not clear...you could say the same thing about legislative legalization, which many in both parties support
ThePlumLineGS	707769790413344769	2016-03-10T03:27:22	MadaGasp that is a real possibility, but it is by no means inevitable
ThePlumLineGS	707769503669686272	2016-03-10T03:26:14	jbarro if you were to expand those as Sanders wants to, that would also be limited to certain categories, depending how it's designed 2/2
ThePlumLineGS	707769292020908032	2016-03-10T03:25:23	jbarro It's hard to answer that Q. DACA and DAPA only apply to certain categories, not unlimited new arrivals 1/2
ThePlumLineGS	707767646134079488	2016-03-10T03:18:51	No one will care, but twitter, deportation relief for the nine million (putting aside whether it's legal) does not = "open borders."
ThePlumLineGS	707767022608916480	2016-03-10T03:16:22	Welcome clarity on the most important question of the evening. 
ThePlumLineGS	707766272038191104	2016-03-10T03:13:23	NickRiccardi hey, I'm here to help. I've done all the work right here ;) 
ThePlumLineGS	707766001585283076	2016-03-10T03:12:19	NickRiccardi Or maybe no one paid attention when Sanders said it
ThePlumLineGS	707765426911059968	2016-03-10T03:10:02	Area reporters suddenly outraged by anti-deportation position that Sanders has held for months, now that Hillary has edged towards it.
ThePlumLineGS	707765217766281216	2016-03-10T03:09:12	NickRiccardi nickconfessore Sanders has been saying this for months: 
ThePlumLineGS	707764401693134848	2016-03-10T03:05:57	I wonder why moderators didn't quote Benghazi family members who said Hillary did NOT cite video: 
ThePlumLineGS	707763604146298880	2016-03-10T03:02:47	Since Ramos is asking about Benghazi families, here is what the families themselves say, per GlennKesslerWP: 
ThePlumLineGS	707763199324639234	2016-03-10T03:01:10	MichaelHansen Okay. I will review the transcript when there is one
