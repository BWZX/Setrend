hassankhan	725797442441060352	2016-04-28T21:22:49	ajetsetgirl It’s the getting “in” where whiteness helps. (quotes bc using end-arounds)
hassankhan	725797387462164480	2016-04-28T21:22:36	ajetsetgirl You’re probably right. Though, I think in SV, once you’re “in” being brown/asian doesn’t hurt.
hassankhan	725796344607178754	2016-04-28T21:18:27	ajetsetgirl I agree that that mechanism is blunted through formal application processes but networking is an end-around.
hassankhan	725796246259163138	2016-04-28T21:18:04	ajetsetgirl did you listen to the interview? This isn’t about formal applications. This is about “being seen” via networking.

hassankhan	725795744758796292	2016-04-28T21:16:04	ajetsetgirl I think there are two aspects at play here. One is the assumption of competence which I think white men get. But w/ whiteness..

hassankhan	723510931129556992	2016-04-22T13:57:02	how much of a drag on the economy are overly vigilant police forces? 
hassankhan	723506622354608128	2016-04-22T13:39:55	grodaeu yeah, my firm went belly-up too and didn’t do much to impact solar either :/
hassankhan	723506480821968898	2016-04-22T13:39:21	BornEricG will do, thanks!
hassankhan	723506390837407744	2016-04-22T13:39:00	but imagine a financial system that doesn’t incentivize homeowners getting solar and the technology of solar looks really different, too
hassankhan	723506286357303296	2016-04-22T13:38:35	solar “took off” when a) the supply disruption in silicon wafers went away b) firms figured out new ways to finance installs
hassankhan	723504633939898369	2016-04-22T13:32:01	grodaeu explain? I don’t know that much about SUNE, more about solar tech
hassankhan	723504444034441216	2016-04-22T13:31:16	But, have finance advances left solar technology in a local minima as other technologies fell by the wayside?
hassankhan	723504165809491968	2016-04-22T13:30:09	pnuts_mama see the following two tweets
hassankhan	723503938717265920	2016-04-22T13:29:15	There’s a related discussion about how we talk about progress and innovation in industries driven by finance vs tech advances
hassankhan	723503611146280961	2016-04-22T13:27:57	One reason solar firms do basically no R&amp;D has to be the success financing vehicles have had in spreading existing technology
hassankhan	723503416572534784	2016-04-22T13:27:11	I’m particularly interested in how these financial instruments impacted technology trajectories in the industry
hassankhan	723503151328964609	2016-04-22T13:26:07	Has anyone written about the impact SUNE had on solar adoption/deployment even as its model broke down

hassankhan	723492225838125058	2016-04-22T12:42:43	CarsonSieving which isn’t to say I don’t care but the marginal value of another firm having data declines, I guess?
hassankhan	723492116899438592	2016-04-22T12:42:17	CarsonSieving but it’s not like your phone company doesn’t already have that data and Google/Apple (from maps)
hassankhan	723492020807995393	2016-04-22T12:41:54	CarsonSieving yeah I was concerned about that too and would like to see that data scrubbed after some time (like 2 months?)

hassankhan	722195931639230464	2016-04-18T22:51:42	SoBendito well, Uber did both (in many cities it would instruct drivers to break the law and it would directly reimburse drivers for fines)

hassankhan	710847105473060864	2016-03-18T15:15:31	pnuts_mama same! buying tops is fun but pants are a) mostly boring anyway (for men) and b) never fit me right
hassankhan	710846994487627776	2016-03-18T15:15:05	petermorency without much thought. i hate buying pants.
hassankhan	710846943346429952	2016-03-18T15:14:52	petermorency e.g. I have a pair of broken-in khakis from Gap that i wanted to like but they fit me super weird. idk, I just want good pants
hassankhan	710846932097359873	2016-03-18T15:14:50	k_ved juliakatherine “had to get my pants tailored” is a pretty cool reason to leave the state
hassankhan	710846594153910272	2016-03-18T15:13:29	k_ved juliakatherine maybe I just buy them and use the tailoring as an excuse to come to NYC
hassankhan	710846097523085312	2016-03-18T15:11:31	I hope when I get around to having kids I have good stories of my youthful indiscretions and failures to tell them.
hassankhan	710845269240315908	2016-03-18T15:08:13	juliakatherine wow check your NY privilege, Julia. (there aren’t any here :| )
hassankhan	710844936237752320	2016-03-18T15:06:54	juliakatherine the problem is they only sell in 34” inseams so need tailoring which, let’s be honest, I’m not gonna do but maybe I should
hassankhan	710844440999534592	2016-03-18T15:04:56	it feels like men’s pants are all bad, where do I buy not terrible pants. thank you.
hassankhan	710844195750150144	2016-03-18T15:03:57	juliakatherine yo, on the real, my mom has way more friends than me. she’s super popular and women our age LOVE her. so, yeah.

hassankhan	710840414861959168	2016-03-18T14:48:56	it’s so infuriating how condescending pundits are toward the impoverished in this country 
hassankhan	710838762620788736	2016-03-18T14:42:22	christinatoms yeah but it took like 100 hours of effort from me to train her on it, only now paying dividends
