SenSanders	726211216906031109	2016-04-30T00:47:01	All over this country there are communities struggling with clean water. In America, in the year 2016 that is unacceptable and must change.
SenSanders	726177496060858369	2016-04-29T22:33:01	I don't care whether you're conservative or progressive, no candidate should have to beg billionaires for contributions.
SenSanders	726141006492635137	2016-04-29T20:08:01	It's time for the United States to catch up with the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee paid family and medical leave.
SenSanders	726104770298175488	2016-04-29T17:44:02	It's disgraceful for billionaires with lower tax rates than their secretaries to say deficit reduction must start with Social Security cuts.
SenSanders	726069813865549824	2016-04-29T15:25:08	I’ve been criticized for this point, so allow me to repeat it: Yes, health care is a right of all people.
SenSanders	726036363167064064	2016-04-29T13:12:12	I want to see America have one of the highest voter turnouts in the world not one of the lowest. We need automatic voter registration.
SenSanders	725846816906948608	2016-04-29T00:39:01	It's cruel for the GOP to blame the poor for a deficit they themselves caused by forgetting to pay for 2 wars and giving the 1% tax breaks.
SenSanders	725810360742219776	2016-04-28T22:14:09	Income should not determine whether you can go to college or see a doctor, or whether your elected representatives listen to your concerns.
SenSanders	725774397374648322	2016-04-28T19:51:15	It's not a radical idea for the United States to provide health care as a right, and 48 percent of millennials agree.
SenSanders	725740124273790977	2016-04-28T17:35:03	Bankers on Wall Street may be fraudulent but they're not dumb. They spend millions lobbying Congress because they know a good investment.
SenSanders	725716980007882752	2016-04-28T16:03:05	I’m proud that Vermont is once again leading the nation by making it easier for people to participate in the political process.
SenSanders	725712515049598977	2016-04-28T15:45:21	NEWS: Sanders Statement on Vermont’s New Automatic Voter Registration Law  
SenSanders	725705702925307904	2016-04-28T15:18:17	In a thousand different ways, we are taught to think small. We are taught to think we can’t change the status quo. That does not have to be.
SenSanders	725636685778690048	2016-04-28T10:44:02	Bernie Sanders: still the most popular senator in America  
SenSanders	725491581718028288	2016-04-28T01:07:26	We must overturn Citizens United so that elections are truly decided by one-person, one-vote, and not by a small number of wealthy families.
SenSanders	725454246888542209	2016-04-27T22:39:05	There is something immoral and unsustainable about our economic system when the top 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom 99 percent.
SenSanders	725413158647676929	2016-04-27T19:55:49	Why is it that in the wealthiest country in the world, people are working two to three jobs just to get by? The answer is corporate greed.
SenSanders	725383544395149313	2016-04-27T17:58:08	We must no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that has been rigged by Wall Street to benefit the wealthiest Americans.
SenSanders	725349328924061696	2016-04-27T15:42:11	Now that a college degree is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50 years ago we must ensure higher education is affordable for all.
SenSanders	725311349987880961	2016-04-27T13:11:16	It's saddening to see 59% of millennials agree that women still face barriers to advancement. We must put an end to gender discrimination.
SenSanders	725128614656790528	2016-04-27T01:05:08	We must never forget that the United States government belongs to all of us and not just the 1 percent.
SenSanders	725094388355969024	2016-04-26T22:49:08	Polls clearly show that progressives and conservatives are united in the belief that it is necessary to reform our campaign finance system.
SenSanders	725059627147255808	2016-04-26T20:31:00	Something is fundamentally wrong with our global economy when the wealthiest 60 people own as much wealth as 3.5 billion people.
SenSanders	725023420778483712	2016-04-26T18:07:08	My parents never had much money but were able to send their kids to college. That dream is no longer a reality for many folks in America.
SenSanders	724987167345356800	2016-04-26T15:43:04	Many politicians' job day after day is calling wealthy folks to ask for donations. Inevitably their worldview is shaped by those people.
SenSanders	724949928292790274	2016-04-26T13:15:06	We must create a government that works for all of us, not just powerful special interests. 
SenSanders	724756634644418560	2016-04-26T00:27:01	People are not truly free when they are unable to feed their family. People are not truly free when they are unable to retire with dignity.
SenSanders	724720974046867456	2016-04-25T22:05:19	Democratic socialism means that we must reform a political system in America which isn't only grossly unfair, but in many respects, corrupt.
SenSanders	724720056496738308	2016-04-25T22:01:40	Americans deserve affordable cable and internet access. This merger will lead to fewer options and higher prices. 
SenSanders	724689030672166912	2016-04-25T19:58:23	People who get sick shouldn't have to worry about cost. They should not end up in an emergency room because they couldn't afford a check-up.
SenSanders	724655994689708032	2016-04-25T17:47:07	It is not acceptable that hedge fund managers who make millions pay a lower effective tax rate than nurses or truck drivers. Period.
SenSanders	724621001045217282	2016-04-25T15:28:04	Nobody who works 40 hours a week should be living in poverty. It's simple. We must raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour.
SenSanders	724584780642299905	2016-04-25T13:04:08	There’s always money for war and for tax breaks for billionaires. But somehow there’s never enough money to rebuild the inner cities.
SenSanders	724399577504317441	2016-04-25T00:48:12	The truth is, we have a rigged economy. It is unsustainable. It is not moral. And it's not the economy we need to be a great nation.
SenSanders	724365054414610432	2016-04-24T22:31:01	Unless Congress stands up for the middle class that's getting stepped on by the billionaire class, soon there won't be a middle class left.
SenSanders	724329863272882177	2016-04-24T20:11:11	It is not a radical idea for every man, woman and child in the United States to have a decent standard of living.
SenSanders	724294433349492736	2016-04-24T17:50:24	The rising cost of college sends the terrible message to young people that your family's wealth should determine your success.
SenSanders	724261115421663232	2016-04-24T15:38:00	Any politician who passes laws to suppress the vote is a political coward and needs to get another job.
SenSanders	724224131701551104	2016-04-24T13:11:03	The time is long overdue for tax reform which says to the wealthy and large corporations that they have to begin paying their fair share.
SenSanders	724039935578279938	2016-04-24T00:59:07	Real change does not take place by sitting down with Mitch McConnell. Real change has always taken place when millions of people demand it.
SenSanders	724008500280606720	2016-04-23T22:54:12	We can combat voter suppression and increase turnout by ensuring that anyone who is of voting age is automatically registered to vote.
SenSanders	723973513384620032	2016-04-23T20:35:11	Freedom of speech, in my view, does not mean the freedom to buy the United States government.
SenSanders	723936559964250113	2016-04-23T18:08:20	You want to know something that is radical: You are living in the only major country that doesn't guarantee health care as a right.
SenSanders	723898007410880512	2016-04-23T15:35:08	Climate change is a global crisis. We've got to move in a bold way to transform our energy system. We have to do it yesterday.
SenSanders	723863807047643136	2016-04-23T13:19:14	My platform isn't radical. Radical is that based on a series of lies we invaded Iraq and hundreds of thousands of people died.
SenSanders	723680309422764032	2016-04-23T01:10:05	We have the moral obligation to leave a habitable planet for our kids and our grandchildren. We must put an end to our use of fossil fuels.
SenSanders	723648095700037632	2016-04-22T23:02:05	Change never comes easily, but in America we've made progress that was once unimaginable -- and we can do so again.
SenSanders	723612095925858304	2016-04-22T20:39:02	What message are we sending kids from poor and middle-class families by saddling them with insurmountable debt for getting an education?
SenSanders	723576127369940993	2016-04-22T18:16:06	Despite living in the most technologically advanced economy in human history, Americans are still worker longer hours for lower wages.
SenSanders	723538161964560384	2016-04-22T15:45:15	It's insane that while McDonald's has opposed an $15 an hour minimum wage for its employees, its CEO received a 368% raise last year.
SenSanders	723502892716531712	2016-04-22T13:25:06	If we're serious about reducing income inequality and rebuilding the middle class, we must increase the number of union jobs in this country
SenSanders	723313647267749889	2016-04-22T00:53:06	We need to make certain every kid in this country, regardless of income, can go to college and leave school without crushing financial debt.
SenSanders	723276180275748864	2016-04-21T22:24:13	It makes no sense to me that CEOs can see their salaries increase by 1000% over 36 years while workers make starvation wages of $7.25/hour.
SenSanders	723243717159706625	2016-04-21T20:15:14	Big, powerful donors are so invested in the status quo that we aren't going to change America unless millions of us fight for that change.
SenSanders	723209499113324544	2016-04-21T17:59:15	We must recognize that allowing all qualified students to achieve a higher education is an investment in our nation's economic prosperity.
SenSanders	723193182138200064	2016-04-21T16:54:25	Change always happens when millions of people demand it. When the American people stand up and fight, they win. 
SenSanders	723176573948596224	2016-04-21T15:48:25	I didn't hear folks in Congress calling wealth redistribution "radical" as $1 trillion got transferred from the middle class to the top 1%.
SenSanders	723140072166531072	2016-04-21T13:23:23	Why is it that only we can't have universal health care? If Germany, if Scandinavia, if every major country does it, then we can do it.
SenSanders	722948473868390401	2016-04-21T00:42:02	When labeling genetically modified food is required in 64 countries around the world, why is it not required in the United States?
SenSanders	722908199632801792	2016-04-20T22:02:00	It's insane people work two or three jobs just to cobble together enough income and some health care benefits to survive. This must end.
SenSanders	722874743527993344	2016-04-20T19:49:03	Forcing parents of a newborn baby to go back to work days after their kid is born is not a family value. We must guarantee paid family leave
SenSanders	722838295403749380	2016-04-20T17:24:13	It's grossly unfair that interest rates on student loans are two to three times higher than on auto loans.
SenSanders	722804829177954304	2016-04-20T15:11:14	When we reform campaign finance, we create a more efficient Congress whose members will no longer need to spend half their time fundraising.
SenSanders	722773088425943050	2016-04-20T13:05:07	The US has got to join every other major industrialized country and guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege.
SenSanders	722585853684531200	2016-04-20T00:41:07	Campaign finance isn't an arcane debate. It has real effects on each working person whose interests are disregarded for big donors.
SenSanders	722555132274192387	2016-04-19T22:39:02	In a democracy, spending millions of dollars on lobbyists should not be the most profitable investment that a corporation can make.
SenSanders	722536738305019904	2016-04-19T21:25:57	I’m pleased the president signed an extension of the Older Americans Act into law today. In this rich nation, no senior should go hungry.
SenSanders	722519416764829696	2016-04-19T20:17:07	It's ludicrous that Morgan Stanley paid nothing in federal income taxes last year, but received $604 million refund from the IRS.
SenSanders	722485709639168001	2016-04-19T18:03:10	It is high time we understood that we have to invest in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration.
SenSanders	722452265156636672	2016-04-19T15:50:17	It is absolutely vital that we act boldly to move our energy system away from fossil fuels. KeepItInTheGround. 
SenSanders	722449178799009792	2016-04-19T15:38:01	Our vision for democracy should be one in which politicians are improving the lives of every day Americans, not just wealthy billionaires.
SenSanders	722414266112983041	2016-04-19T13:19:17	The 12.2% rise in drug spending last year was due in large part to price hikes on existing medication. Big drug companies are ripping us off
SenSanders	722219713934307329	2016-04-19T00:26:12	Rather than an economy aimed at the common good, deregulation and Reaganomics have left us with an economy operated by and for the top 1%.
SenSanders	722180693346934785	2016-04-18T21:51:09	Just 50 people give 41% of super PAC donations. Citizens United has given a few ultra-wealthy people unprecedented power over our democracy.
SenSanders	722151782214971394	2016-04-18T19:56:16	Transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels will not only protect the environment but create good-paying jobs.
SenSanders	722119520811409408	2016-04-18T17:48:04	When your kid gets sick, you should know that you can take them to the doctor. Do you know what kind of load that is off parents' shoulders?
SenSanders	722098436112297985	2016-04-18T16:24:17	As a nation built by immigrants, we must strive for humane immigration policies that unify families, not tear them apart. FightForFamilies
SenSanders	722086798214737920	2016-04-18T15:38:03	The reality is that for 40 years there’s been an enormous transfer of wealth from the middle class and poor to the rich.
SenSanders	722050575723020288	2016-04-18T13:14:06	The U.S. can create the necessary revenue needed to create millions of jobs to rebuild our infrastructure by closing corporate tax loopholes
SenSanders	721857294112288768	2016-04-18T00:26:05	Maybe before we demand cuts to Social Security, we should end the blatant outrage of offshore tax havens that cost us $100 billion per year.
SenSanders	721821603089289220	2016-04-17T22:04:15	We can create million of jobs and fight climate change by transforming our energy system away from oil, coal and gas to renewable energy.
SenSanders	721789841369886720	2016-04-17T19:58:03	How do we make the American dream a reality again? We can start by making college tuition free so every American can get an education.
SenSanders	721757904114737152	2016-04-17T17:51:08	Corporations should not be able to buy their own tax rate with lobbyists. In a democratic society, everyone must pay their fair share.
SenSanders	721724147777335296	2016-04-17T15:37:00	There is something massively wrong when the 62 richest folks in the world own more wealth than the bottom 3.5 billion.
SenSanders	721690191551930369	2016-04-17T13:22:04	The middle class in America is angry because for decades their wages have stagnated while the rich got richer.  That must change.
SenSanders	721498169339691009	2016-04-17T00:39:03	Every working person in the United States should have a chance at a decent life through guaranteed paid medical, family and sick leave.
SenSanders	721461707030310912	2016-04-16T22:14:09	It's appalling that nearly half of Americans have less than $10,000 in savings and no idea how they will be able to retire with dignity.
SenSanders	721428239273574402	2016-04-16T20:01:10	The biggest banks spent over $20 million on lobbying every year. It would be naive to suggest they aren't expecting anything in return.
SenSanders	721395047137177600	2016-04-16T17:49:16	All the time, I see billionaires pushing policies that make themselves richer and others poorer. That’s not what human life should be about.
SenSanders	721358998595891200	2016-04-16T15:26:02	The challenges facing our planet are not mainly technological or even financial. Our challenge is mostly a moral one.
SenSanders	721329353540440064	2016-04-16T13:28:14	Why did the 50 largest companies spend $2.7 billion lobbying elected officials? To get $337 billion in tax breaks. 
SenSanders	721148384355201026	2016-04-16T01:29:07	It's a disgrace that the tax dodging of multinational corporations costs the U.S. approximately $111 billion each year. This must end.
SenSanders	721129721216393216	2016-04-16T00:14:58	What the pope is saying and I'm saying is that our lives should be about more than just the accumulation of wealth. 
SenSanders	721096769157914625	2016-04-15T22:04:01	It's a national disgrace that 70 percent of undergraduates leave college with heavy debts that will burden them for decades.
SenSanders	721091240851349505	2016-04-15T21:42:03	Bernie Sanders joins world leaders, celebrities in call for overhaul of global drug policy  
SenSanders	721045466432069633	2016-04-15T18:40:10	What do Bernie &amp; the pope have in common? SenSanders explains in an annotated speech.   
SenSanders	721061288999260160	2016-04-15T19:43:02	62% of Americans have less than $1,000 in their savings accounts and unlike big banks they don't get to go to Congress for a bailout check.
SenSanders	721028606340820992	2016-04-15T17:33:10	It's alarming that just 62 individuals have the same wealth as 3.6 billion people. That's nearly half of humanity.
SenSanders	721016251863142400	2016-04-15T16:44:04	Bernie Sanders: I annotated a speech by Pope Francis  
SenSanders	720996610478616576	2016-04-15T15:26:02	If corporations can be American when they need a bailout from the American people, then they can pay their fair share of U.S. taxes too.
SenSanders	720990037542875137	2016-04-15T14:59:54	It is outrageous that the kid who smokes marijuana gets arrested but the crooks on Wall Street get off scot free. 
SenSanders	720970577780023298	2016-04-15T13:42:35	Top 50 US companies stash $1.4 TRILLION in taxhavens. Here's what it costs poor countries →  
SenSanders	720966197328678913	2016-04-15T13:25:11	No full-time worker deserves to live in poverty. We have got to raise the federal minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour.
SenSanders	720768853731577856	2016-04-15T00:21:00	It's outrageous that one-fifth of large corporations in America paid nothing in taxes between 2008 to 2014. They must pay their fair share.
SenSanders	720735885013164033	2016-04-14T22:10:00	Women in America want the whole damn dollar. And they're right. Equal pay is an issue of basic equality not a radical idea.
SenSanders	720703670464212994	2016-04-14T20:01:59	It’s time to tell Wall Street that if they do not end their greed, we will end it for them.
SenSanders	720672773333520384	2016-04-14T17:59:13	Thanks to Bernie Sanders, we now know how many big corporations don’t pay taxes  
SenSanders	720667715376193538	2016-04-14T17:39:07	The millionaire class and billionaire class increasingly own the political process, and they own the politicians that go to them for money.
SenSanders	720633556431683584	2016-04-14T15:23:23	My "radical" $5 billion youth jobs plan costs 1/120th the amount of potential tax revenue we let corporations hide overseas.
SenSanders	720613076274294786	2016-04-14T14:02:00	BIG thanks SenWarren CoryBooker SenSanders for joining 1,000+ others urging UN to end the drug war.  UNGASS2016
SenSanders	720587919145177088	2016-04-14T12:22:02	Who said it:  Bernie Sanders or the Pope?  
SenSanders	720598786461052928	2016-04-14T13:05:13	When you organize at the grassroots level, whether it's gay rights or raising the minimum wage, that's when change takes place.
SenSanders	720430198890631168	2016-04-14T01:55:19	I know that people aren't comfortable when I say this, but I worry very, very much about the future of democracy in our country.

SenSanders	715167738583449600	2016-03-30T13:24:10	There are fair ways to reduce deficits but cutting programs that benefit the vulnerable while giving the rich tax breaks is not among them.
SenSanders	714975425827573760	2016-03-30T00:39:59	I do not believe that men and women fought and died for our right to vote so billionaires could buy elections to protect the powerful.
SenSanders	714938256664764416	2016-03-29T22:12:17	My parents' dream was that if they worked hard as parents they'd see their kids go to college. We must keep that promise to every family.
SenSanders	714904465493598208	2016-03-29T19:58:01	Common sense dictates that elections should be determined by who has the best ideas, not who can hustle the most money from the wealthy.
SenSanders	714872295492288512	2016-03-29T17:50:11	Social Security, the minimum wage and Medicare are just a few of the benefits workers won thanks in large part to the trade union movement.
SenSanders	714857712857833472	2016-03-29T16:52:14	We must make it easier, not harder, to form a union. We must confirm a justice who will give working people a voice. 
SenSanders	714838807661690881	2016-03-29T15:37:07	We must significantly cut carbon emissions and break our dependence on fossil fuels. We must commit to keep fossil fuels in the ground.

SenSanders	714474727390199808	2016-03-28T15:30:23	It’s not just planes, tanks and guns that are a cost of war. The cost of war is taking care of those people who were injured in that war.

SenSanders	714225743853666304	2016-03-27T23:01:01	If we are serious about protecting the planet and improving our economy, America must focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy.
SenSanders	714187013008801792	2016-03-27T20:27:07	We need to fundamentally change the way Wall Street does business. We should not risk our economy on casino-style gambling.
SenSanders	714151549837176832	2016-03-27T18:06:12	We must do away with the corporate loopholes that currently exist, which enable corporations to pay next to nothing in federal taxes.
SenSanders	714117287335305216	2016-03-27T15:50:03	There is no reason the United States must maintain a bloated military budget which spends almost as much as the rest of the world combined.
SenSanders	714082324539949057	2016-03-27T13:31:07	It is important that the American people stand together and end bigotry.
SenSanders	713892294362066944	2016-03-27T00:56:01	It's absurd that over the past decade the net worth of the top 400 billionaires in this country has doubled to an astronomical $1 trillion.
SenSanders	713858102551035908	2016-03-26T22:40:09	The bottom line is, if we hope to compete in the global economy, we must increase our investment in our transportation infrastructure.
SenSanders	713824402417270785	2016-03-26T20:26:14	Despite advances in technology and increases in productivity, millions of Americas today are still working longer hours for lower wages.
SenSanders	713788437413937157	2016-03-26T18:03:19	A student who studies hard gets hit with insurmountable debt, yet bankers who crashed our economy got a bailout and bonuses.

SenSanders	713463967193178112	2016-03-25T20:33:59	We have got to fundamentally rewrite our trade policy laws so that American products, not jobs, are our number one export.
SenSanders	713428235527319553	2016-03-25T18:12:00	Fossil fuel companies are willing to destroy the planet for short-term profits. That is incomprehensible.
SenSanders	713389778931163136	2016-03-25T15:39:12	Offshore drilling does not achieve the goals its advocates claim and is not worth the risk. Time to move away from oil, not drill for more.
SenSanders	713352795383013376	2016-03-25T13:12:14	If our democracy is to survive, we need to make this clear: our elections are not, and must never be, for sale to the highest bidder.
SenSanders	713163089429008384	2016-03-25T00:38:25	Between you and me, and everyone else in America, corporations are not people. They don't get a vote and shouldn't be able to buy elections.
SenSanders	713138868393025541	2016-03-24T23:02:10	We must ask the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share into Social Security by lifting the income payroll tax to $250,000.
SenSanders	713125795477192705	2016-03-24T22:10:13	My advice for climate change deniers in Congress is to worry more about their children's future and less about their campaign contributors.
SenSanders	713095835073044482	2016-03-24T20:11:10	Our political system by and large is owned and controlled by big money interests.
SenSanders	713076781507612672	2016-03-24T18:55:27	The Exxon Valdez oil spill cost up to $7 billion and the consequences persist today. The evidence is clear. We must keep it in the ground.
SenSanders	713056789831532545	2016-03-24T17:36:01	CEOs are seeing their salaries soar and the gap between the rich and the poor grows wider. That has to do with campaign finance reform.

SenSanders	713023701462204416	2016-03-24T15:24:32	Our country should tell young people: "You can run for office without begging the rich and powerful for campaign contributions."
SenSanders	712991982981877760	2016-03-24T13:18:30	To discourage young people from going to college due to cost isn't just a tragedy for those individuals. It will be a tragedy for our nation
SenSanders	712801222307225601	2016-03-24T00:40:29	Apparently for many in the top 1%, owning and controlling our economy is not enough. They now want to own and control the government.
SenSanders	712769929179693056	2016-03-23T22:36:08	As the threat of oligarchy increases, the major political task we face is to protect our democracy.
SenSanders	712730208676290561	2016-03-23T19:58:18	I have real concerns about the war on drugs, which has destroyed the lives of many people who were never involved in violent activity.
SenSanders	712710681221578752	2016-03-23T18:40:42	Climate change is ultimately not a political issue. It's moral. Now is the time for bold action to save our planet. 
SenSanders	712698939657596928	2016-03-23T17:54:03	New tax breaks for the rich and big corporations may be popular in country clubs, but it's way out of touch with what most Americans want.

SenSanders	712626261336653824	2016-03-23T13:05:15	America is not about attacking the most vulnerable people in our country. We cannot allow that to happen.
SenSanders	712447435143057408	2016-03-23T01:14:39	The government must be vigorous in protecting the American people from terrorism, but you can do that without undermining the Constitution.
SenSanders	712414108033949696	2016-03-22T23:02:14	For far too long, Congress has been set by powerful corporate interests and a right wing that doesn't represent the needs of most Americans.
SenSanders	712369014983548929	2016-03-22T20:03:03	We are fighting a terrorist organization, a barbaric organization that is killing innocent people. We are not fighting a religion.
SenSanders	712356485209202688	2016-03-22T19:13:15	We can feed a senior for an entire year for the cost of one day in the hospital. Let’s expand and support Meals on Wheels.
SenSanders	712338057278709760	2016-03-22T18:00:02	No one will be successful in dividing us. America becomes a greater nation, a stronger nation, when we stand together as one people.

SenSanders	712072825998286848	2016-03-22T00:26:06	While other nations are guaranteeing health care as a right, we spend more on our military than the next nine nations combined.
SenSanders	712036584720355328	2016-03-21T22:02:05	We should end the regressive policy of government making billions in profits off student loans taken out by low and middle income families.
SenSanders	712004926055047168	2016-03-21T19:56:17	It is not acceptable that as workers have become more productive, their wages and benefits have gone down and profits went to those on top.
SenSanders	711966871340371968	2016-03-21T17:25:04	Congress must begin listening to the majority of Americans who are saying they do not want cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
SenSanders	711965246521536514	2016-03-21T17:18:37	Verizon made $39 billion in profit in 3 years. The workers who made that possible deserve a fair contract.

SenSanders	711900953377644544	2016-03-21T13:03:08	The wealthy have seen their incomes rise immensely in the last 30 years. It is not class warfare to say they don't need another tax break.
SenSanders	711719560802660353	2016-03-21T01:02:21	In a world of so much violence, I just don't believe that government itself should be part of that. We must abolish capital punishment.
SenSanders	711685518212337664	2016-03-20T22:47:04	Mexico's agricultural sector lost 1.3 million jobs in the 10 years after NAFTA. It was a lose-lose for working people both here and there.
SenSanders	711650561452601344	2016-03-20T20:28:10	It's unacceptable that the richest 16,000 families in the U.S. now own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.
SenSanders	711614528878997504	2016-03-20T18:04:59	We can't grow jobs if people don't have enough money to buy products made by other people. Raising the minimum wage is basic economic sense.
SenSanders	711580606321262594	2016-03-20T15:50:11	If we are to prosper in a global economy, we must have the best educational system in the world from childcare through college.
SenSanders	711545077370380288	2016-03-20T13:29:00	It is class warfare when the wealthy buy our elections to get tax breaks for themselves and cut spending to programs the rest of us need.
SenSanders	711357896362172416	2016-03-20T01:05:13	When the United States already requires labeling of more than 3,000 ingredients, there is no practical reason GMOs cannot join that list.

SenSanders	710820633630924800	2016-03-18T13:30:20	The Republican perspective for decades has been that the poor are to blame for the deficit and they have written their budgets accordingly.
SenSanders	710639420060336129	2016-03-18T01:30:15	Boeing pays no taxes. Verizon gets a refund. Pfizer stashes their money abroad. It is high time we ask these groups to pay their fair share.
