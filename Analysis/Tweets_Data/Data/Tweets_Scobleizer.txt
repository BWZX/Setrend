Scobleizer	696021536919023616	2016-02-06T17:24:00	thegadgeteur most of your content isn't focused. It isn't all of equal value.
Scobleizer	696021384552525824	2016-02-06T17:23:24	jmarovt cdevroe I miss nothing. I use Nuzzel and Techmeme. :-)
Scobleizer	696021230005067776	2016-02-06T17:22:47	bingmert my Facebook has NONE of that which shows you haven't put in the time
Scobleizer	696020838416457728	2016-02-06T17:21:13	cdevroe I mostly use lists here on Twitter. With only a few hundred on each. Filtering still needed.
Scobleizer	696020499491454977	2016-02-06T17:19:53	the_spinmd I am sure Twitter will still show that.
Scobleizer	696020385666433024	2016-02-06T17:19:26	People who argue against filters must not use Gmail. It filters out spam very efficiently.
Scobleizer	696020071366262785	2016-02-06T17:18:11	thegadgeteur Kosmatos really? Every use Gmail? Its spam filters do an amazing job!
Scobleizer	696019727093661696	2016-02-06T17:16:49	the_spinmd in my experience important stuff always gets through. Shows that you don't understand filtering.
Scobleizer	696019087718154240	2016-02-06T17:14:16	Kosmatos Facebook is way better than Twitter. You just haven't put in the time.
Scobleizer	696018921296506880	2016-02-06T17:13:36	jasonventer it doesn't work well for most.
Scobleizer	696018636239085568	2016-02-06T17:12:28	ToddKlindt I am sure there will be a way to get non filtered feed. On Facebook lists are not filtered.
Scobleizer	696018114618617857	2016-02-06T17:10:24	I don't get the hate over filtering that Twitter is rumored to being turned on. Most of your shit (and mine) SHOULD be filtered!
Scobleizer	695641994505404416	2016-02-05T16:15:50	It's worth watching at least the first few min of Scobleizer's reaction to metaglasses AR demo he got yesterday.

Scobleizer	692527724963962880	2016-01-28T02:00:50	BrainScraps sarahcuda Well that's one way to look at it. Another way is that it needs to hire tech talent. Self driving makes it easier.

Scobleizer	692521801050689536	2016-01-28T01:37:18	sarahcuda I think Uber thinks there's infinite supply of labor. It might be right, actually. Anyway, Lyft is working on this too.
