jay_21_	726078375039750144	2016-04-29T15:59:09	VegaVandal I dont think they have good intl distribution so using NFLX and Hulu overseas makes sense

jay_21_	726067487582879744	2016-04-29T15:15:53	nuggy5 IDK - they have the audio and video library Do they license it? Stream it? IDK - but I think it will be impactful
jay_21_	726062159466213376	2016-04-29T14:54:43	nuggy5 Im not sure honestly Video-wise Im thinking what are they going to do with Stern's library which is near term event

jay_21_	726053816211218433	2016-04-29T14:21:33	nuggy5 Biggest source of upside in near term is re-levering. They got some room to step on the gas for repurchases or acquire something
jay_21_	726053094908432384	2016-04-29T14:18:41	nuggy5 Do I see 20% returns? No - but think its a good shot at mid double digits for a fair amt of time (almost off current FCF alone)
jay_21_	726052721028141056	2016-04-29T14:17:12	nuggy5 I look at what they did with DTV and say "Hey a non capital intensive highly scalable communication platform is valuable"

jay_21_	726052360108294144	2016-04-29T14:15:46	nuggy5 Upside is so ephemeral: intl, video, streaming platform, ad-supported radio for nonsubs, connected car? One of those should be big

jay_21_	726050301095108608	2016-04-29T14:07:35	nuggy5 Cant help but look at current penetration and think they have plenty of room to grow subs

jay_21_	722913802497302529	2016-04-20T22:24:16	Summary of Wheeler's comments on broadcasters today: 
jay_21_	722913584280240128	2016-04-20T22:23:24	NoonSixCap Think he has a new account
jay_21_	722896084322820096	2016-04-20T21:13:51	PlanMaestro Underrated response. I enjoyed it
jay_21_	722871559833067521	2016-04-20T19:36:24	LucreSnooker Its what I am doing currently As retrans grows the value prop of broadcasters will shrink so Im curious what happens next
jay_21_	722863919807639552	2016-04-20T19:06:03	SSCapital13 JohanHjortsson Same Like Legacy cos the most bc of leverage &amp; discount then CHUB then SIRI Never spent too much time on OTAs
jay_21_	722862367172747264	2016-04-20T18:59:53	Broadcasters have such an interesting history: PE -&gt; Distressed Debt -&gt; Hedge Fund -&gt; ? 
jay_21_	722861718632726530	2016-04-20T18:57:18	SSCapital13 JohanHjortsson Obviously we dont know the prices on the post Ventures spins yet so maybe you cant have a full view now
jay_21_	722861574336065536	2016-04-20T18:56:44	SSCapital13 JohanHjortsson Dont think I have picked your brain yet on favorites post LVNTA &amp; LMCA spin Anything really interesting?
jay_21_	722855936562323457	2016-04-20T18:34:19	Why are broadcast channels a main part of skinny bundles when you get them over the air? Optimal skinny bundle = an antenna + HBO / NFLX?
jay_21_	722849101587574784	2016-04-20T18:07:10	SSCapital13 JohanHjortsson It's a leap of faith. If the flywheel starts turning its going to be very valuable If doesn't its going to suck
jay_21_	722845252512559104	2016-04-20T17:51:52	SSCapital13 JohanHjortsson Meant more they have acquisitions in mind that synergize with or complement LYV
jay_21_	722828663583031296	2016-04-20T16:45:57	SSCapital13 JohanHjortsson That's what LMCA is right now Even LYV is a deal making option

jay_21_	722807501758943232	2016-04-20T15:21:52	hackcelerity jnvest LevontinCapital SkeleCap I mean by year end you could be looking at $1b-ish and liquid cash to do something with
jay_21_	722807372624764930	2016-04-20T15:21:21	hackcelerity jnvest LevontinCapital SkeleCap No - the Braves will pay the note to LMCA back using the rights offering proceeds

jay_21_	722615620769026050	2016-04-20T02:39:24	SkeleCap Ok - that makes sense Thanks
jay_21_	722615380808724480	2016-04-20T02:38:26	SkeleCap Whoops wrong column in my spreadsheet. Closer to parity than 100
jay_21_	722614880474435584	2016-04-20T02:36:27	SkeleCap Yeah - and its trading 100bp behind Viacom which doesnt make sense to me
jay_21_	722614680003440642	2016-04-20T02:35:39	SkeleCap DISCA is seen as more business risky vs Viacom?
jay_21_	722613985074376704	2016-04-20T02:32:54	SkeleCap But why not DISCA or another media co which has less tail risk imo has a higher yield and less risk imo
jay_21_	722612981822058496	2016-04-20T02:28:55	SkeleCap It just looks odd and usually odd things dont stay that way
jay_21_	722612729559805954	2016-04-20T02:27:54	SkeleCap Heres an instance where you want to be on the sell side for once

jay_21_	722578426058686464	2016-04-20T00:11:36	covenantlite Agree - they did but they weren't growing premiums to surplus at crazy rates They were disciplined
jay_21_	722576134718758912	2016-04-20T00:02:29	covenantlite When rates were high people would bleed out underwriting losses left and right Sucked then too

jay_21_	722574292068737027	2016-04-19T23:55:10	Everyone looks at BRK and says insurers should be great investments but no one looks at M&amp;T or Home Depot and rushes into banking or retail

jay_21_	722571314670735360	2016-04-19T23:43:20	SkeleCap Liberty8988 BluegrassCap MKL is the closest and they will struggle to do 10-12% over the long term
jay_21_	722571108776615936	2016-04-19T23:42:31	SkeleCap Liberty8988 BluegrassCap GLRE Third Point SAC etc Yeah
jay_21_	722570204698570753	2016-04-19T23:38:56	Liberty8988 BluegrassCap IMO There's no BRK clones bc insurance is a shitty industry and stock pickers can make more running a fund
jay_21_	722567675042512896	2016-04-19T23:28:53	BluegrassCap giovfranchi Corp governance might be an issue But I agree Eventually they will merge anyways

jay_21_	722518472819875840	2016-04-19T20:13:22	ValueDude Yeah but why not make the initial one bigger? Now they have to go back to the board and get approval
jay_21_	722516913600012288	2016-04-19T20:07:10	ValueDude So small and they completed it in three weeks Its just ridiculous Why not actually make it substantive

jay_21_	722491744403722240	2016-04-19T18:27:09	How attractive is the LSXMA event path? Dont you get taken out at NAV? Its a bonus but not a thesis? 
jay_21_	722480629208784896	2016-04-19T17:42:59	Reflexive situation here...if you get dropped you lose scale If you concede, then all future negotiations are worse

jay_21_	722460221830991872	2016-04-19T16:21:54	17thStCap Find_Me_Value Absolutely - they own a real estate development and a piece of MLBAM which are the only cash flowing aspects to it

jay_21_	722067469117034496	2016-04-18T14:21:14	jnvest Yeah - Im at something similar. BATs was a at a big discount but i dont really like that asset tbh

jay_21_	721406615824572416	2016-04-16T18:35:14	17thStCap Makes sense. Choosing something with 30 to 80 for the next one
jay_21_	721405749973229568	2016-04-16T18:31:48	17thStCap Obviously something I wouldnt pitch to deep value or distressed shop but maybe an event driven shop (altho they know it already)
jay_21_	721405521614544898	2016-04-16T18:30:54	17thStCap It was also to highlight a post-spin opportunity with more upside due to a settlement But that idea didnt play out
jay_21_	721405262012268544	2016-04-16T18:29:52	17thStCap 1 year price target based on NAV discount. Further upside driven by underlying asset appreciation
jay_21_	721403422084374528	2016-04-16T18:22:33	covenantlite Thats my theory. 5 to 10% NAV discount a la Broadband
jay_21_	721403195487031296	2016-04-16T18:21:39	covenantlite Most likely outcome is some type of merging trust where the two are combined and margin gets paid from SIRIs B/S No tax

jay_21_	721377012657569792	2016-04-16T16:37:37	covenantlite Was thinking whats tax treatment on discount bonds Think some the accretion is taxable? If not thats source of deferred taxes
jay_21_	721373995174662145	2016-04-16T16:25:37	covenantlite Too hard to put on as retail so we are stuck with doubleline, BDCs, busted REITs, and the skele's of the world
jay_21_	721373823321448449	2016-04-16T16:24:56	covenantlite Think basket of HY fixed income (PL resi, Non-IG CLOs, and selective HY bonds) would be a better risk / reward

jay_21_	704740012412301313	2016-03-01T18:48:07	PlanMaestro so also not sure how much they will be able to implement very expensive software and security teams
jay_21_	704739879322836993	2016-03-01T18:47:35	PlanMaestro True - I know some of my friends in bank consulting said small banks cant handle the DFAST costs etc
jay_21_	704739209765060610	2016-03-01T18:44:55	PlanMaestro Yeah - I was just thinking how much security / software costs are coming down the pipe

jay_21_	704475879993376768	2016-03-01T01:18:32	@KeshikCapital PlanMaestro Yeah - thought MCO indicated something greater than what I remember from looking through SUNEs ppts
jay_21_	704475182967160832	2016-03-01T01:15:46	PlanMaestro But never really dove into SUNE to figure out how much that would affect them
jay_21_	704475073860800513	2016-03-01T01:15:20	PlanMaestro Thanks! Thought Moody's suspicion that a lot of the cash they had was trapped in projects was very concerning
jay_21_	704470443139469312	2016-03-01T00:56:56	PlanMaestro Probably not going concern so I can only think corp governance issues   But really no clue

jay_21_	704469897405964289	2016-03-01T00:54:46	PlanMaestro Yes - but GLBL has a dividend strike at 1.10 so its only TERP they can get divi's from

jay_21_	701221006275432448	2016-02-21T01:44:50	hackcelerity jschembs Agree but I think content cos are putting pressure on the bundle along with a consumer preference shift towards VOD
jay_21_	701218005544525824	2016-02-21T01:32:55	hackcelerity jschembs Turner networks seem closest to VIA but I think sports and good curation have saved them
jay_21_	701217670138634240	2016-02-21T01:31:35	hackcelerity jschembs Someone is clearly wrong about their pricing power Not sure who at this point (everyone has written off VIA already)
jay_21_	701217413606592512	2016-02-21T01:30:34	hackcelerity jschembs My view: the bundle is expensive and everyone thinks they have untapped pricing power based on some metric
jay_21_	701208051726946304	2016-02-21T00:53:22	hackcelerity jschembs Is current cable share the right metric? How do networks change when broadcasters are asserting their pricing power?
jay_21_	701195559512711169	2016-02-21T00:03:43	hackcelerity jschembs I am. Anyone reliant on scripted dramas gets extra scrutiny. Starz is probably too cheap tho
jay_21_	701193150493282305	2016-02-20T23:54:09	hackcelerity jschembs Agree - they still dominate an over saturated market but that point was more how does Turner stay relevant?
jay_21_	701192690558488576	2016-02-20T23:52:19	hackcelerity jschembs Right - i dont think its a good short b/c NFLX=HBO isnt in the stock and theres takeout risk (also mildly cheap)
jay_21_	701192359216816128	2016-02-20T23:51:00	hackcelerity jschembs And whats the risk of overproducing content and burning capital?
jay_21_	701191722777321473	2016-02-20T23:48:28	jschembs hackcelerity Yeah - if more weight was given to that argument and there was no takeout risk it would probably be a short
jay_21_	701191175726878726	2016-02-20T23:46:18	hackcelerity jschembs Now that the HBO spin was put on hold where is the upside? You can make a case for $80, but nothing to get it there?

jay_21_	698193165971488769	2016-02-12T17:13:17	victoriouscake Yes
jay_21_	698192052283117568	2016-02-12T17:08:51	victoriouscake They also hold TERP so they need to extract more dollars than dollar value of pain inflicted on TERP to be NPV positive
jay_21_	698191785269530624	2016-02-12T17:07:48	victoriouscake I get what you are saying and agree to a certain extent but think its a very low probability event (could be wrong)
jay_21_	698191489332023296	2016-02-12T17:06:37	victoriouscake Its really difficult to execute that at today's prices 1 $ of projects at 10% IRR would need 1 $ of equity at 15+% IRR
jay_21_	698190862963101696	2016-02-12T17:04:08	victoriouscake Agree - but I think their options are limited to do anything Very hard to keep pushing down on them Cant do VSLR easily
jay_21_	698187005797277696	2016-02-12T16:48:48	victoriouscake Huge breach of fiduciary duty to issue equity at these prices They would indict themselves (especially with Tepper watching)
jay_21_	698185526935998466	2016-02-12T16:42:55	victoriouscake Outside Vivint, this isnt material risk anymore imo And at this price runoff may be a decent IRR so new projects matter less
jay_21_	698183420577501184	2016-02-12T16:34:33	victoriouscake They should be able to answer first question now, which would probably cause some price upside
jay_21_	698183277463654401	2016-02-12T16:33:59	victoriouscake In long term, yes Near term bankruptcy causes uncertainty / negativity: what happens to PPAs? what happens to SUNE's stake?
jay_21_	698178709895958530	2016-02-12T16:15:50	victoriouscake SUNE overhang is very real and they should be getting out in front of it and explaining potential scenarios
jay_21_	698178597513793536	2016-02-12T16:15:23	victoriouscake If TERP was being run for their own shareholders, they would be communicating with investing community way better

jay_21_	688764790664228864	2016-01-17T16:48:17	WallStCynic John_Hempton Didnt mean to pick on you specifically Residual/renewal risk seems commonly cited and I dont see much
jay_21_	688764558975078400	2016-01-17T16:47:22	WallStCynic John_Hempton I dont think the bet is on lease renewal. You can generate high single digits ROEs without it
jay_21_	688759994066534400	2016-01-17T16:29:13	jay_21_ The pillars I mentioned 
jay_21_	688759661911236608	2016-01-17T16:27:54	jay_21_ Fox's international growth 
jay_21_	688747257571729408	2016-01-17T15:38:37	After some research this does not appear to be right. Solar projects seem to earn mid-single digit IRRs w/o residual 
jay_21_	688561418816360449	2016-01-17T03:20:09	jay_21_ And the types of products will be more expensive / higher margin: VOD, premium scripted dramas, HD TV, etc
jay_21_	688561188154814464	2016-01-17T03:19:14	jay_21_ Lastly international markets are mostly developing markets. They will grow in size and income Content consumption will increase
jay_21_	688560900425560065	2016-01-17T03:18:06	jay_21_ The key is having content that appeals to a lot of people because you get to exploit scale economics
jay_21_	688560795903504384	2016-01-17T03:17:41	jay_21_ The development costs are near zero, which makes content very profitable in new markets
jay_21_	688560635538468864	2016-01-17T03:17:03	jay_21_ And then you start thinking about content portability. A lot of content will be imported into international markets
jay_21_	688560412787392512	2016-01-17T03:16:09	jay_21_ Its less about whats best and more about whats available. The competitive forces are diminished.
jay_21_	688560206343573504	2016-01-17T03:15:20	jay_21_ However, OTA can work just fine because it means network / linear TV is viable You do not have a VOD component
jay_21_	688559994292301825	2016-01-17T03:14:30	jay_21_ This is both an opportunity and a threat. Pay TV is naturally good because it adds an additional revenue stream
jay_21_	688559872837824512	2016-01-17T03:14:01	To expand a little on my international versus domestic content point: Some markets are not fully penetrated with Pay TV

jay_21_	685159413267697664	2016-01-07T18:01:48	@fakehfm My biggest concern with BRK is size Too diversified, hard to move the needle, less opportunities, etc Still bullish tho
jay_21_	685158097028026368	2016-01-07T17:56:34	@fakehfm Curious on your FV or P/BV for BRK Think banks here are cheap but agree with mkt that there are unclear growth drivers/ROE impacts

jay_21_	685130881388929025	2016-01-07T16:08:25	MarAzul_90 SkeleCap MarZaul - why wasnt ESG that great? Margins looked pretty good during the boom
jay_21_	685127364922241024	2016-01-07T15:54:27	SkeleCap MarAzul_90 Good pt Skele. From equity persepective, glad they locked up a revolved and have tons of cash to do whatever
jay_21_	685126231004712960	2016-01-07T15:49:57	MarAzul_90 SkeleCap One way to think about it is if a consulting firm goes BK, just hire the consultants and dont buy the business itself
jay_21_	685126037341126656	2016-01-07T15:49:10	MarAzul_90 SkeleCap 2/ Now its cheaper to expand by buying equipment and hiring teams than acquiring other businesses outright
jay_21_	685125918931742720	2016-01-07T15:48:42	MarAzul_90 SkeleCap 1/ Possible - but equally likely is they secured the geographies and business lines they want
jay_21_	685125468534771712	2016-01-07T15:46:55	MarAzul_90 SkeleCap They said if they acquire it would be in aero. His statement today confirmed they can still do an aero deal
jay_21_	685125368760659971	2016-01-07T15:46:31	MarAzul_90 SkeleCap Not really though. They are bringing capex down a lot and said they wont acquire new businesses
jay_21_	685124974504505345	2016-01-07T15:44:57	SkeleCap Effectively acquiring without paying for a whole business. Wish I had more insight into how good the business is
jay_21_	685124840957833216	2016-01-07T15:44:25	SkeleCap I actually like their energy stance here. Instead of buying businesses outright, they are buying equipment and personnel
jay_21_	685124581053599745	2016-01-07T15:43:23	SkeleCap Purely price driven imo. Not even all of this years FCF. And they have been saying no energy business buys

jay_21_	684067871266332672	2016-01-04T17:44:24	MebFaber DavidSchawel Interesting. Can you list the 10? Thanks
jay_21_	684064602049638401	2016-01-04T17:31:25	robertqking Good point. I remember that as well. Its more I think GM is not interested

jay_21_	683773722109554688	2016-01-03T22:15:33	SkeleCap stockthoughts81 Interesting connection between Big Short and Thorndike/Outsiders. Definitely not the amateurs Lewis portrays
jay_21_	683728541855444992	2016-01-03T19:16:02	Lots of things down this year. Dispersion in stocks returns presents opportunities for stock pickers 
jay_21_	683693291792142336	2016-01-03T16:55:57	yitechang jamiepastore Sure But what counterparty would be on those CDS? If you think financial world fails hard to find counterparties
jay_21_	683672291654385664	2016-01-03T15:32:31	jamiepastore No but aligns with my understanding that Lewis was too negative in his portrayal

jay_21_	683382145683861504	2016-01-02T20:19:34	liebo7 I think the ppl that did long SUB long SEN CDS probably had on the best trade b/c of positive carry and very asymmetrical payoff
jay_21_	683381620691238912	2016-01-02T20:17:29	liebo7 It was like 2-3x upside and a 0 if wrong that paid out in 2-3 years. Given his track record, the opp cost of the bet was very high
jay_21_	683380583011991552	2016-01-02T20:13:22	liebo7 Yes, but also his drawndown was ~50% so really like 250% which is still phenomenal
jay_21_	683366054232338432	2016-01-02T19:15:38	WineRex Recent short? Nice call if so
jay_21_	683363094018445316	2016-01-02T19:03:52	WineRex Yup - think in the movie it was a carry of 100m on 500m AUM Didnt help that he paid too much and probably should have got ~50-70m
jay_21_	683360258694057984	2016-01-02T18:52:36	WineRex If he was off by one year or two, the fund might have gone close to zero. Good analysis on the resets but sizing was gigantic
jay_21_	683358239438716928	2016-01-02T18:44:35	mystcrich Cost of carry very high relative to AUM. Notional exposure = 3x AUM
jay_21_	683351894366883840	2016-01-02T18:19:22	If the Big Short movie accurately depicted Burrys exposure, it was very imprudent
