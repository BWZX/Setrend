fundamentalmac	690604214234550272	2016-01-22T18:37:30	boes_ Yeah, smalls up
fundamentalmac	690603632128049156	2016-01-22T18:35:11	boes_ GS FCI including oil is flat YTD
fundamentalmac	690603500099784705	2016-01-22T18:34:39	boes_ I am betting they don't do much tho in their calcs. IG spreads not that much wider. And silly to put much weight on equity move
fundamentalmac	690602873370066944	2016-01-22T18:32:10	boes_ unfortunately they don't give the details, but assume almost entirely due to stronger dollar. 4 hikes overplaying it IMO

fundamentalmac	690477576612089856	2016-01-22T10:14:17	thalesians Thanks mate. When I wrote this one a few weeks ago it felt very consensus. Not so much now. :)
fundamentalmac	690477303562944513	2016-01-22T10:13:12	LadyFOHF Thanks v much. :)
fundamentalmac	690476305532522496	2016-01-22T10:09:14	A longish blog post on monetary policy divergence: 
fundamentalmac	682543184392667136	2015-12-31T12:45:50	thalesians thanks mate. and to you too.
fundamentalmac	682538213458751488	2015-12-31T12:26:05	2015 blog review (hopefully this link works). Thanks to everyone who supported my blog in 2015: 
fundamentalmac	682537280410640384	2015-12-31T12:22:23	thalesians Something weird going on with the post. But should be working now.
fundamentalmac	682537204653121539	2015-12-31T12:22:05	t0nyyates Something weird going on, but it should work now.
fundamentalmac	682535262866554881	2015-12-31T12:14:22	thalesians hey Saeed. The one in the blog post itself?
fundamentalmac	682534690444718082	2015-12-31T12:12:05	2015 in review 
fundamentalmac	672501279722184704	2015-12-03T19:42:54	DavidTaggart expectations were too high. And positioning extended again, but these are big moves.
fundamentalmac	672501130153304064	2015-12-03T19:42:18	DavidTaggart I thought they would do exactly what was delivered. I didn't think it would get this mkt reaction tho
fundamentalmac	672500677835399169	2015-12-03T19:40:30	JeremyWS it might be 100% priced if FF only goes up to the bottom of the band.
fundamentalmac	671757231470354433	2015-12-01T18:26:19	ericbeebo thanks. There was a good piece out from Barclays today on this issue.
fundamentalmac	671463133727334400	2015-11-30T22:57:40	boes_ ericbeebo libor-OIS forwards not done anything much tho
fundamentalmac	671456488787955713	2015-11-30T22:31:16	boes_ plus central bank swap lines should cap the extent that xccy can blow out now
fundamentalmac	671455655597842436	2015-11-30T22:27:57	boes_ not enough stress for individual or collective $ funding prob. Unless $ getting sucked out elsewhere. Maybe petro$ reversal I guess
fundamentalmac	671454531205599233	2015-11-30T22:23:29	martin_whetton JeremyWS bearish! I hope your right!
fundamentalmac	671454239265267712	2015-11-30T22:22:20	boes_ xccy doing odd things everywhere atm. Like there is a $ squeeze. But there can't be??
fundamentalmac	671453356691480577	2015-11-30T22:18:49	martin_whetton JeremyWS do you guys still have one more cut in your central case? Or are you now no change next year?
fundamentalmac	671452730096017413	2015-11-30T22:16:20	JeremyWS martin_whetton ...maybe the NAB sentiment bounce is just a Turnbull honeymoon reaction and will reverse again
fundamentalmac	671452477359792128	2015-11-30T22:15:20	JeremyWS martin_whetton if capex is a sign of things to come, then I think you are right...
fundamentalmac	671451679074689024	2015-11-30T22:12:09	JeremyWS martin_whetton with no meeting in Jan, we could see a bit of jawboning tom, but I still think they hope the Fed will help out.
fundamentalmac	670341129112547329	2015-11-27T20:39:14	DuncanWeldon just saw your job news. Congratulations! Hope you get to have a break first.
fundamentalmac	664395245036118016	2015-11-11T10:52:24	DavidTaggart thanks. Still to be determined. But hopefully in some capacity.
