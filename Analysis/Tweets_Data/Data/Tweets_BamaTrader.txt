BamaTrader	723234197058498561	2016-04-21T19:37:24	IvanTheK Sort of sets aside the finite limits of the system.
BamaTrader	723234069585235968	2016-04-21T19:36:53	IvanTheK Agree. And that's the failure of a "central planning" construct, imo - our expectations without considering what sys can provide.
BamaTrader	723233502611791873	2016-04-21T19:34:38	CrmOneOne4 IvanTheK Why Americans continue to believe that we're going to get a solution from gov alone astounds me.
BamaTrader	723229550683910145	2016-04-21T19:18:56	IvanTheK BamaTrader I spent 10 years in NZ, which is a hybrid system. You'd think that the creative forces here could make that idea work
BamaTrader	723232625024966662	2016-04-21T19:31:09	IvanTheK Additionally, the elephant in the room is supply/demand of the Healthcare system itself.
BamaTrader	723232416765190144	2016-04-21T19:30:19	IvanTheK I think it's the (basically) one size fits all approach I think can't work.
BamaTrader	723232079572557824	2016-04-21T19:28:59	IvanTheK We agree there. But that's not happening now with the HCA. So, again, what has the govt achieved?
BamaTrader	723216325879959552	2016-04-21T18:26:23	IvanTheK I want a menu and a choice. Just like we buy everything else.
BamaTrader	723215957615906816	2016-04-21T18:24:55	IvanTheK What is the biggest problem?  Pre-existing?
BamaTrader	723215685397168128	2016-04-21T18:23:50	IvanTheK Who says they have to have Scale?  With re-insurance, boutique insurers could offer exactly what insured want.
BamaTrader	723215302138441728	2016-04-21T18:22:19	IvanTheK Correct. Why the duplicate operations in each State like BC/BS? That cost is incredible.
BamaTrader	723214899002900480	2016-04-21T18:20:43	IvanTheK What if you could only buy a vehicle that was distributed by a dealer located in your State?

BamaTrader	723214344465592320	2016-04-21T18:18:31	IvanTheK Because it hasn't been allowed to. Interstate commerce must be allowed into the equation. We can't just throw that aside.
BamaTrader	723214067851210752	2016-04-21T18:17:25	IvanTheK It was a "closed-system", with no outside input allowed other than Democrats and Lobbyists. No good solution was to come of it.
BamaTrader	723213717962416129	2016-04-21T18:16:01	IvanTheK I'm not convinced of that. Do you remember watching the 'live' Congressional write-up sessions?
BamaTrader	723213322506637313	2016-04-21T18:14:27	IvanTheK I believe so deeply in "smartness" bubbling to the top of innovation and disruption outside of gov interference.
BamaTrader	723212899171336192	2016-04-21T18:12:46	IvanTheK Sure there is. We wouldn't have an iPhone if the govt mandated and regulated our cell phones.
BamaTrader	723212420341223424	2016-04-21T18:10:52	IvanTheK Do you think Obamacare changed Healthcare for the better, or are the majority of families worse off than before it?
BamaTrader	723211990425055232	2016-04-21T18:09:09	IvanTheK No, if you have - DM it to me.  I have a grandfathered plan, pre Obamacare, that we have stayed with.
BamaTrader	723190499297886208	2016-04-21T16:43:45	IvanTheK As we celebrate disruption in all variants of our lives - Healthcare has been set aside to reman bound to the 20th century.
BamaTrader	723190079498407936	2016-04-21T16:42:05	IvanTheK Obamacare slammed the door, locked it and swallowed the key for the next gen of disruption where we need it the most.

BamaTrader	682457794746953729	2015-12-31T07:06:32	Don't invent a new form of silly. It's tv you can watch when you want to.

BamaTrader	682454107379097600	2015-12-31T06:51:53	Financial TV is NOT for investors. It appears to be like an incestual orgy where only those involved get off on a regular basis.

BamaTrader	682449477890867202	2015-12-31T06:33:29	If you can't take it, or offend easily - get hard, buck up, grow a pair and get in the conversation.
