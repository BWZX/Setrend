FranklinFoer	700163383291547648	2016-02-18T03:42:13	JamesGleick True. But the government's threat to privacy is nothing next to the mass of information that SV companies collect and sell.

FranklinFoer	700159945627430912	2016-02-18T03:28:34	Apple will trash your privacy far more than the government ever will.
FranklinFoer	700158950486847488	2016-02-18T03:24:36	Since the info Apple possesses is so sacrosanct, I think they should submit to a new regulatory regime to ensure that they don't exploit it.

FranklinFoer	696414268246376448	2016-02-07T19:24:34	Marco Rubio gets credit for his optimism--i'd call him a chirpy Jeremiah or a bubbly apocalyptic.
FranklinFoer	696412588276629504	2016-02-07T19:17:54	The thing about Marco Rubio's stump speech....it's actually really well crafted and well delivered.
FranklinFoer	696411676611055616	2016-02-07T19:14:17	Marco Rubio is bouncy this afternoon.
FranklinFoer	696410496031916035	2016-02-07T19:09:35	Thirty seconds into his stump speech Marco Rubio is reciting his stump speech.

FranklinFoer	696405834897690624	2016-02-07T18:51:04	Guy introducing Rubio: Every time I hear him, I hear something A LITTLE different.
FranklinFoer	696344688467513344	2016-02-07T14:48:05	Once again, Chris Christie proves the ferocity of his hatred for his political enemies. He just shut Marco Rubio's lane to the nomination.
FranklinFoer	696183887865712640	2016-02-07T04:09:07	3-2-oops!
FranklinFoer	696183382494093312	2016-02-07T04:07:07	Rubio was a media pet. That was a pillar of his strategy for concocting momentum. It's a big deal that the media has decided to crush him.

FranklinFoer	696178141589565440	2016-02-07T03:46:17	The establishment never fully rallied around Rubio. Maybe it knew something.

FranklinFoer	696172369765916672	2016-02-07T03:23:21	All I want for my catastrophic debate performance is a canned anecdote about two front teeth.

FranklinFoer	696161255128764416	2016-02-07T02:39:11	Donald Trump has been lazy about campaigning the past few days. Maybe that's why he looks fresher than the rest.
FranklinFoer	696160395065757696	2016-02-07T02:35:46	Dr. Carson, somehow I doubt you were the first to talk about Libya.

FranklinFoer	696155425792729088	2016-02-07T02:16:02	Trump is the least convincing Burkean in America.
FranklinFoer	696155059814604800	2016-02-07T02:14:34	Is the problem Rubio's strategy or is it just Rubio?
FranklinFoer	696152656381870080	2016-02-07T02:05:01	Jeb Bush has come to believe the righteousness of his critique of Trump. He's much more confident and adept on the offensive.
FranklinFoer	696152428689891329	2016-02-07T02:04:07	Eminent Domain is the doctrine that Trump cares about most deeply.
FranklinFoer	696152005270773760	2016-02-07T02:02:26	Probably time for Fox News to interrupt the debate and assure viewers that Rubio won

FranklinFoer	696150262889713664	2016-02-07T01:55:31	Rubio is talking gibberish. No, he's stammering gibberish.
FranklinFoer	696149137767718912	2016-02-07T01:51:02	Single-spaced plans are more serious.
FranklinFoer	696147643546918912	2016-02-07T01:45:06	As Bush has stalled, he's grown ever more hawkishness. He may even be more neocon than his brother now.
FranklinFoer	696147064590303232	2016-02-07T01:42:48	Now that they have hit Rubio on his memorization, Trump will ding him for sweatiness. Watch! Amnesty attack will appear soon after.
FranklinFoer	696145081053552640	2016-02-07T01:34:55	Rubio failed the Turing Test... GOPDebate
FranklinFoer	696145269642149889	2016-02-07T01:35:40	Chris Christie was Donald Trump-like in seizing on Rubio's greatest weakness.
FranklinFoer	696144830309789696	2016-02-07T01:33:55	This memorization meme is a good one. More, please!
FranklinFoer	696144693911023616	2016-02-07T01:33:23	Marco Rubio DOES memorize his lines. It's a pretty impressive feat.
FranklinFoer	696144454013554689	2016-02-07T01:32:26	Marco Rubio can't even counterpunch with reverting to his stump speech.
FranklinFoer	696142191199195136	2016-02-07T01:23:26	Question: Will Trump ding Rubio tonight? He's shown exceedingly little interest in messing with the golden boy.
FranklinFoer	696141851695439872	2016-02-07T01:22:05	Handed a chance to nail Trump, Cruz demurs. He knows that Trump is deflating without a pin prick from him.
FranklinFoer	696025392436662272	2016-02-06T17:39:19	Jeb first denies that he's part of the "warmongering crowd," ten minutes later he pledges to escalate the campaign against Isis into war.
FranklinFoer	696022669523816452	2016-02-06T17:28:30	You know, I actually find Jeb more authentic than his competitors--patrician, goofy, a little flummoxed.
FranklinFoer	696018573018427393	2016-02-06T17:12:13	Jeb says people who have a problem with him because he's a Bush and "establishment" need therapy
FranklinFoer	696018365068943360	2016-02-06T17:11:24	Jeb: "the Bush thing, people need to get over it." Umm, no problem there, it seems.
FranklinFoer	696017847663767553	2016-02-06T17:09:20	jasoncherkis the question was true. The answer was snark, maybe smarm.
FranklinFoer	696016483344777216	2016-02-06T17:03:55	Jeb says his policy booklet was used to beat a pit bull. So, see, it will have some utility after Tuesday.
FranklinFoer	696014464555024386	2016-02-06T16:55:54	Are politicians affected by money in Bush politics, Jeb is asked. No the problem is money can't affect politics, he answers.
FranklinFoer	696014080688185344	2016-02-06T16:54:22	The charming part of Jeb is that he still speaks in the old Bush language of high WASP noblesse oblige--purpose, servitude.
FranklinFoer	696013479640231937	2016-02-06T16:51:59	Bush's stump speech is a dialogue with the base about its misguided deeply instinctual craving for domineering, slap-happy strongmen.
FranklinFoer	696012876138602498	2016-02-06T16:49:35	Jeb says Trump needs therapy. The truth is only medication would work.
FranklinFoer	696011774152351744	2016-02-06T16:45:12	Jeb: when we had hurricanes, we didn't cut and run...he bravely resisted moving to Alabama.
FranklinFoer	696011759505768448	2016-02-06T16:45:09	Jeb: we have sophisticated weapons, we don't need to carpet bomb now.
FranklinFoer	696011644367986688	2016-02-06T16:44:41	Jeb Bush next president "needs to be a little quieter" as he has modeled in those debates.
FranklinFoer	696010847731195904	2016-02-06T16:41:32	Jeb rejects that he's part of the "warmongering crowd" while saying that he'll play offense.
FranklinFoer	696008864009949184	2016-02-06T16:33:39	Jeb's closing argument is almost painfully straight forward compared to the artful jabbing and tactical gamesmanship of his competitors.
FranklinFoer	696007983977930752	2016-02-06T16:30:09	Jeb's message is all about family. It's the dynasty that never says dienasty.

FranklinFoer	695761614243495936	2016-02-06T00:11:10	Ted Cruz's theatrical oratory is both campy and strangely mesmerizing.
FranklinFoer	695758104269602817	2016-02-05T23:57:13	Credit to Cruz, he's had his eyes on Rand Paul voters for months.  The guy has tactical savvy.

FranklinFoer	695475259491758080	2016-02-05T05:13:17	When George W. Bush ran, incuriosity about the world was a warning sign. I don't expect Sanders to launch invasions. But it's still lame...
FranklinFoer	695467778904489984	2016-02-05T04:43:34	Voter fraud was once  the GOP narrative for general elections, now it's how they understand their own.... 
FranklinFoer	695465965929103360	2016-02-05T04:36:22	Hillary has grown and improved in most every way, except her deep inability to understand and accept the political virtues of transparency.
FranklinFoer	695454719016333312	2016-02-05T03:51:40	What about Rubio saying he changed his mind on Mexican immigration because of ISIS? 
FranklinFoer	695454338932740096	2016-02-05T03:50:09	To answer the question Todd asked and Clinton evaded: yes, she will flip-flop back again and support TPP if elected.
FranklinFoer	695452118124089344	2016-02-05T03:41:20	It's ok if debates aren't comprehensive tours of the horizon; this has been substantive and good.

FranklinFoer	695448766397050880	2016-02-05T03:28:01	A kind word for electability questions: Voters deserve to know their standard barer has a theory of winning, or is on a quixotic bender.
FranklinFoer	695448308001538049	2016-02-05T03:26:12	I mean, let me just retweet this AGAIN for emphasis: 
FranklinFoer	695448014224109572	2016-02-05T03:25:02	Foreign policy flailing is emblematic: Sanders is morally right about so many things, but so uninterested in the practical details.
FranklinFoer	695445393509777408	2016-02-05T03:14:37	Senator Sanders, can you please release the transcripts of your foreign policy speeches?
FranklinFoer	695444025852080128	2016-02-05T03:09:11	Sanders could become the Democratic nominee. It would be nice if he spent thirty seconds thinking about running American foreign policy.
FranklinFoer	695443544417312768	2016-02-05T03:07:16	We know Bernie's core foreign policy conviction: Break up the banks.
FranklinFoer	695442863350362113	2016-02-05T03:04:33	I had a paragraph on foreign policy buried in my disquisition on socialism.
FranklinFoer	695438696405798916	2016-02-05T02:48:00	This this this. 
FranklinFoer	695438876169469956	2016-02-05T02:48:43	I'd bet those paid speeches are utter pablum, but it would be so Clinton to refuse to release transcripts until issue has badly wounded her
FranklinFoer	695106746218606592	2016-02-04T04:48:57	Best way to punish the banks is to bilk them for exorbitant speaking fees.
FranklinFoer	694895282148872192	2016-02-03T14:48:40	Once you split off the crucial "race war" vote (Trump) and goldbug vote (Cruz), the libertarian coalition didn't have much left for Rand.
FranklinFoer	694893176067219456	2016-02-03T14:40:18	Curious what TheJusticeDept antitrust officials think upon reading news like this

FranklinFoer	694367108591800321	2016-02-02T03:49:54	Marco Rubio congratulates Hillary Clinton on a hard fought campaign. Says her supporters will be heard by his administration.
FranklinFoer	694353109817151492	2016-02-02T02:54:16	Keep in mind: the reason Rubio's been going after Cruz rather than Trump was that it was far better for Rubio if Trump won Iowa.
FranklinFoer	694350464540803072	2016-02-02T02:43:45	I just hope a Cruz win doesn't make the guy smug and unlikeable
FranklinFoer	692898458567487488	2016-01-29T02:34:00	Google must be so proud of its role in tonight's proceedings.
FranklinFoer	692896716064956416	2016-01-29T02:27:05	This undercard debate is a snooze.
FranklinFoer	692519844965715969	2016-01-28T01:29:32	Trump hardly seemed to have much conviction about his reasons for skipping. It felt pretty clear that he's being tactical.
FranklinFoer	692517804482891778	2016-01-28T01:21:25	Not lying: Bill O'Reilly boasting now about how Trump owes him a lot of Vanilla milkshakes.
FranklinFoer	692143742208348161	2016-01-27T00:35:02	HeerJeet that came off wrong. The craziness was imputed to the base, not you, of course. You're a judicious polymath.

FranklinFoer	692142737240518657	2016-01-27T00:31:02	Edsall I've been scratching my head on that one for some time.
FranklinFoer	692141768217878528	2016-01-27T00:27:11	A fine moment to test the proposition: Is Donald Trump a crazy genius or just a lucky lunatic?

FranklinFoer	688932797134823424	2016-01-18T03:55:53	Network post-debate self-congratulation is some of the lamest stuff to come from the spin room.

FranklinFoer	688930853678878720	2016-01-18T03:48:09	Sanders depicts politics as being like House of Cards. Clinton depicts it as being like Veep. Clinton is correct.
FranklinFoer	688930722787233792	2016-01-18T03:47:38	Bernie's genuinely pained reaction to the WJC thing really makes me like him and hate politics.

FranklinFoer	688920644491329536	2016-01-18T03:07:35	Clinton's defense of Dodd-Frank is persuasive. Her attempt to paint Sanders as in hoc to Wall Street is laughable.
