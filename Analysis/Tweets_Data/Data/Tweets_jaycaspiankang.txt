jaycaspiankang	718085791948222464	2016-04-07T14:39:28	michaelbd eh, I reject this. they made this bed by refusing to adjust in anything resembling journalistic good faith
jaycaspiankang	718084422575108096	2016-04-07T14:34:02	michaelbd youre really doing some backflips here. you really dont think baseball media hiring and culture was, in any way, biased?
jaycaspiankang	718082993852518400	2016-04-07T14:28:21	michaelbd I doubt that's true at all. Overlap between ppl hired into those positions, yes, but that's not even close to the same thing.
jaycaspiankang	718082765728579584	2016-04-07T14:27:27	michaelbd it's not charity to learn how to cover 30% of the league. It's your job and it's good business and they still are slow to change
jaycaspiankang	718082582672334848	2016-04-07T14:26:43	michaelbd what I drives me crazy is that speaking Spanish for a baseball writer is the biggest advantage one could have
jaycaspiankang	718082116781670402	2016-04-07T14:24:52	michaelbd they've had 25 years to adjust. Eric Nadel did it. Also you can hire Spanish speaking reporters?
jaycaspiankang	718081290277298176	2016-04-07T14:21:35	michaelbd the Latin players that became stars did so in spite of the media, not because of it.
jaycaspiankang	718081183620333568	2016-04-07T14:21:10	michaelbd the structure isn't the problem - it is immutable, at least imho. The problem is that the media ignored 30% of the league
jaycaspiankang	718080544823640065	2016-04-07T14:18:37	michaelbd maybe. The current structure provides a choice for young fans. I think it's funny when Gossage or papelbon get red assed
jaycaspiankang	718080128002097152	2016-04-07T14:16:58	michaelbd of course other things matter- this is a column making one argument. Your response is to say 'the world is complicated'
jaycaspiankang	718079971852333056	2016-04-07T14:16:21	michaelbd and frankly it pisses me off  when convos about race are derailed by people saying 'hey other things matter!'
jaycaspiankang	718079656407085057	2016-04-07T14:15:06	michaelbd I enjoy your work and hate being defensive of my own, but I think you just misread the piece or skipped the last line
jaycaspiankang	718079119892676608	2016-04-07T14:12:58	michaelbd which I addressed at lengthy
jaycaspiankang	718079042688159745	2016-04-07T14:12:39	michaelbd C) there are less conflicts, however dumb, for people to rally around D) less Cam dabbing moments
jaycaspiankang	718078782020542464	2016-04-07T14:11:37	michaelbd yes A) baseball demos are changing and media has done shit job covering Latin players B) baseball becomes whiter
jaycaspiankang	718078288397082624	2016-04-07T14:09:39	michaelbd it is literally the lease sentence of the piece 
jaycaspiankang	718077809948626944	2016-04-07T14:07:45	michaelbd I said it was the catalyst that drives interest- not sure how I could have been more clear
jaycaspiankang	718077710526861313	2016-04-07T14:07:22	michaelbd exactly! Young people make choices in the culture war
jaycaspiankang	718077286105255936	2016-04-07T14:05:40	michaelbd that's exactly the point. How does the media portray it, regardless of what the source actually is? What becomes 'scandal?'
jaycaspiankang	718076697120153600	2016-04-07T14:03:20	michaelbd and he is trying to jack swagger from black and Latino athletes
jaycaspiankang	718076074421137408	2016-04-07T14:00:52	michaelbd and you're using the one counter example to disprove the rule. Who cares about his popularity?
jaycaspiankang	718075883605524480	2016-04-07T14:00:06	michaelbd if you don't think that has everything to do with race, I don't know what to tell you
jaycaspiankang	718075723848650752	2016-04-07T13:59:28	michaelbd more to the point, he wants to be Cam or Steph and doesn't get why he's not as popular
jaycaspiankang	718075472693735425	2016-04-07T13:58:28	michaelbd I don't see a single thing in there except other players think he's overrated?
jaycaspiankang	718074671950737409	2016-04-07T13:55:17	michaelbd craigcalcaterra Harper is taking a cue from Bautista - do you really think he does this if Bautista doesn't toss his bat?
jaycaspiankang	718074247273324546	2016-04-07T13:53:36	michaelbd craigcalcaterra that's  the point - the culture wars, however silly, DO help drive interest in baseball. It presents a choice
jaycaspiankang	718073900777676801	2016-04-07T13:52:13	michaelbd craigcalcaterra also Michael, of course it's the conventional belief of kids to side with Griffey and Pedro etc.
jaycaspiankang	718073627363573760	2016-04-07T13:51:08	michaelbd craigcalcaterra bogcommenter re: Harper. He proves the point. The players he cites are mostly black and Latino.
