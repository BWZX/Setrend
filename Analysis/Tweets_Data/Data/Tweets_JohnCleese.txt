JohnCleese	725457043008708608	2016-04-27T22:50:12	I quote Andy Burnham on Hillsborough : 'This cover-up goes right to the top'  And the thrice-accursed Sun keeps it off the the front page !
JohnCleese	725439383562772480	2016-04-27T21:40:01	It's in my tweets here and there if you know how to spot it  If not,try a joke book. There's nothing else in them 
JohnCleese	725437777266020352	2016-04-27T21:33:38	Naughty ! Especially for one so young...  But last night's frites were really the best I've ever eaten 
JohnCleese	725437215489331200	2016-04-27T21:31:24	I was going to and the Flemish backstage guy said he'd NEVER heard of it.I'll re-instate it. Thanks... 
JohnCleese	725436326150033409	2016-04-27T21:27:52	..at which Greig's MoS won the Best Newspaper of the Year Award. Motive for the boycott ? Envy ? Punishment ? Or just another heart attack ?
JohnCleese	725435301271851008	2016-04-27T21:23:48	...when most people thought Greig would be Dacre's successor.  And all this just after Dacre and his gang boycotted the Press Awards...
JohnCleese	725434622193098752	2016-04-27T21:21:06	And how odd that just after Greig runs Whittingdale,Dacre steals Greig's no 2 at the MoS,to groom as his successor at the Daily Mail.......
JohnCleese	725433639593480194	2016-04-27T21:17:12	And is it a coincidence that the editor of the Independent also completely changed his mind after a lunch with Dacre. Dacre frightens people
JohnCleese	725432988360708098	2016-04-27T21:14:36	Judge for yourself. Is it more likely that Greig completely changed his mind,or that Paul Dacre had a word with him ? Isn't it a no brainer?
JohnCleese	725431843978366976	2016-04-27T21:10:04	You make a judgement. I believe Geordie Greig told his staff that Whittingdale was a test of a newspaper's mettle... 
JohnCleese	725429270399619077	2016-04-27T20:59:50	Very warm reaction from the Antwerps tonight,including a great sitting ovation.  Maybe I'll try a new opening,instead of " Hallo,Belgians !'
JohnCleese	725344775570907136	2016-04-27T15:24:05	Today's news : 'Desserts' spelled backwards makes 'stressed' ;  Flemish is identical to Dutch,when written Aliquid semper novi ex Antwerp

JohnCleese	725341612990160896	2016-04-27T15:11:31	Apologies for my lack of clarity.Roy said the allegations that a press conspiracy was the reason for the original suppression of the story
JohnCleese	725340095235166208	2016-04-27T15:05:29	As Cathcart maintains,there are five valid reasons why the Whittingdale story was in the public interest.Please answer these,Roy Greenslade
JohnCleese	725339128104099841	2016-04-27T15:01:38	Greenslade dismissed allegations of press skulduggery as a 'conspiracy' and he doesn't believe in them  What does he think of Hillsborough?
JohnCleese	725337975219994626	2016-04-27T14:57:04	Saw the BBC debate between Guardian media correspondent Roy Greenslade and Brian Cathcart,where they discussed the Whittingdale 'conspiracy'
JohnCleese	725048726025342976	2016-04-26T19:47:41	Mark...this is a fine poster.Dr Chapman would have approved   How can  get one ?   
JohnCleese	725047887340666880	2016-04-26T19:44:21	Been and gone ! Sorry... The damn rotters were a friendly,if undemonstrative audience But it was a Sunday night... 
JohnCleese	725046812885811200	2016-04-26T19:40:05	No,Cameron sacked him before the election  Revealing how the Tories behave without decent people to restrain them

JohnCleese	724345166337839107	2016-04-24T21:11:59	I'm very touched.Thank you 
JohnCleese	724344859079925760	2016-04-24T21:10:46	Dear Pablo Sorry the comparative breadth of my interests irritates you,but most of my twits are similarly inclined 
JohnCleese	724262681960697856	2016-04-24T15:44:14	Whippingdale expresses his admiration for Murdoch,and Cameron backs him  Am I being naive in detecting a possible bias on Cameron's part ?
JohnCleese	724259580696530944	2016-04-24T15:31:54	I just want to make sure that I've got this right... Vince Cable expresses antagonism towards Murdoch and Cameron replaces him Whereas...
JohnCleese	723755246690926592	2016-04-23T06:07:52	Which is...? 
JohnCleese	723639171219357696	2016-04-22T22:26:37	Yes,I always wondered why he never mentioned that.It's not the sort of thing that would easily slip your mind. 
JohnCleese	723637188202782720	2016-04-22T22:18:44	Any urgency ? 
JohnCleese	723636625067114496	2016-04-22T22:16:30	Excellent Zelo Street piece today on the Telegraph.This once-great paper is now the propaganda sheet of the money-grubbing Barclay brothers

JohnCleese	723271699295272960	2016-04-21T22:06:25	Can someone explain this to me? Why are so many Christians obsessed with sexuality,when Christ himself seems to have said so little about it
JohnCleese	723270263538876420	2016-04-21T22:00:43	Very good 
JohnCleese	723270112577462272	2016-04-21T22:00:07	And I did it myself !  ( This is a dreadful lie )         (  Details later from Swedish TV guy called Andrew )   
JohnCleese	723269065553358848	2016-04-21T21:55:57	I knew he'd enjoy it 
JohnCleese	723268396742238208	2016-04-21T21:53:18	As usual,Zelo Street's piece on Whittingdale superb.Hits the nail on the head  It's so much clearer and better written than the DM or DTel
JohnCleese	723128181578846208	2016-04-21T12:36:08	Good to see that Terry Gilliam's still working! 
JohnCleese	722805890156331010	2016-04-20T15:15:27	Nobody knows more about the British Press than Hislop,and he absolutely destroys their hastily erected defence,using common sense and humour
JohnCleese	722804682003914752	2016-04-20T15:10:39	Shocked by news of Victoria Wood. I worked with her last year and was reminded of just what a superlative performer she was.Only 62 !
JohnCleese	722701102622380032	2016-04-20T08:19:04	The right wing Press dismissed the Whittingdale story as 'not in the public interest.' Watch Ian Hislop

JohnCleese	722656313466077184	2016-04-20T05:21:06	Sir Harold Evans,the greatest Editor in my lifetime,has spoken eloquently of the press's dishonesty over Leveson... 
JohnCleese	722655024870985732	2016-04-20T05:15:58	Well,it's important to remember that philistines are not apathetic about Culture.No,they actively hate it,since it's so hard to monetise...
JohnCleese	722653613647114240	2016-04-20T05:10:22	I suppose it would take a Tory Minister of Culture to consider Lap-dancing to fall within his remit.Why does Cameron appoint philistines ?
JohnCleese	722024654949511169	2016-04-18T11:31:06	Monday morning, typical bustling Gothenburg scene. 
JohnCleese	721733043162112000	2016-04-17T16:12:21	No,that's Palin.He's the little bandy-legged one,who yesterday celebrated 50 years marriage to his poor wife,Helen 
JohnCleese	721732507784376320	2016-04-17T16:10:13	He told me once he'd never read a book,and he was a terrible ( good-natured ) bull-shutter,but... he knew his media 
JohnCleese	721730680439324672	2016-04-17T16:02:57	As all their best journalists have left or been fired,the Barclay brothers do now need to hire at least one really good one,for emergencies
JohnCleese	721730016422326272	2016-04-17T16:00:19	I wonder if the Daily Torygraph still feels that the BBC is 'pursuing an agenda' over John Whittingdale. What a bunch of ideological clowns
JohnCleese	721658965369757697	2016-04-17T11:17:59	...it's satisfying to learn about the warfare between the DM and the MoS. Michael Winner always told me that they hated each other.  Now...
JohnCleese	721653793495072768	2016-04-17T10:57:26	The Mail has always been keen to find discord in the Python team - not difficult,since we don't agree on much,though we laugh a lot  So...
JohnCleese	721653040340725760	2016-04-17T10:54:27	Really good,clear story in Private Eye about Whittingdale,clarifying a little the process by which the Independent Editor spiked the story.
JohnCleese	721604473131556864	2016-04-17T07:41:27	I hope David Cameron continues to stand behind Whittingdale - but only for as long as he stood by Andy Coulson
JohnCleese	721599432844787716	2016-04-17T07:21:26	( Smart career move,Geordie )
JohnCleese	721599070293401600	2016-04-17T07:19:59	I'll let you know in a couple of weeks... 
JohnCleese	721598695867817984	2016-04-17T07:18:30	Oh,no ! Sorry !! It's the Mail on Sunday,not Hacked Off.That's all right then...  Maybe the Telegraph will show the BBC is behind it all
JohnCleese	721597775209721856	2016-04-17T07:14:50	Embarrassed that Hacked Off, in their own narrow self-interest,are hounding poor Whittingdale again,after the Telegraph proved him innocent
JohnCleese	721415159298813952	2016-04-16T19:09:11	No,my parents-in-law were definitely not stupid.Just naive  So,how can I become more self-unimportand while tweeting 
JohnCleese	721413015342616578	2016-04-16T19:00:40	JohnCleese My parents-in-law were certainly not morons.But they were naive  BTW,how can I become more self-unimportant when tweeting ?
JohnCleese	721412288297754624	2016-04-16T18:57:47	When you propagate poverty,humility and tolerance,you need a very rich,powerful,authoritarian organisation to do it 
JohnCleese	721266582605926400	2016-04-16T09:18:48	Quite a nice shower, but no soap dish. How's this possible? Were they distracted by other important work? 
JohnCleese	721266211938574336	2016-04-16T09:17:20	It's not a hotel. It's a construction site with optional accommodation. 
JohnCleese	721265851891130368	2016-04-16T09:15:54	In marked contrast to elitehotels Linkoping. Here's the view into the corridor from my room. 
JohnCleese	721264554886434816	2016-04-16T09:10:44	Just stayed in excellent hotel the elitehotels Karlstad. Efficient, friendly, very good food. Nice 14th century lifts, too...
JohnCleese	721260829379805184	2016-04-16T08:55:56	Nice to see the Vatican being so accepting of the people of Lesbos
JohnCleese	721245474292920320	2016-04-16T07:54:55	Re-write,please 
JohnCleese	721245042661277696	2016-04-16T07:53:12	I delighted by how many of you are saying this 
JohnCleese	721244866404073473	2016-04-16T07:52:30	Noted 
JohnCleese	721244798208864256	2016-04-16T07:52:14	Noted 
JohnCleese	721233561618157569	2016-04-16T07:07:35	I think its naivety.My parents-in-law used to take it till they started reading 'stories' they know something about 
JohnCleese	721231519524732928	2016-04-16T06:59:28	It's quite simple : you have to read a bit and then make a choice between Professor Brian Cathcart and foul-mouthed'millionaire' Paul Dacre
JohnCleese	721227038804287488	2016-04-16T06:41:40	I wonder...is there a single Daily Mail reader who can see what's going on,or are they all too distracted by reports that food causes Cancer
JohnCleese	721225064159514625	2016-04-16T06:33:49	May I suggest that Hacked Off publishes a list of their current supporters - something that is usually censored by the mendacious UK  Press
JohnCleese	721224407050530816	2016-04-16T06:31:12	Dacre tries to demonise 'millionaire' JK Rowling.Since when was 'millionaire' a term of abuse for a right-wing paper owned by Rothermere ?
JohnCleese	721223038499471360	2016-04-16T06:25:46	As Lord Acton said 'Power corrupts,and absolute power corrupts absolutely' What enrages Dacre is that he is now less powerful than he was
JohnCleese	721222548877361152	2016-04-16T06:23:49	Contrast it with a classic mad piece from Dacre - a splenetic hatchet job on Max Mosley,the progeny of pin-ups of the Daily Mail itself
JohnCleese	721220775773081600	2016-04-16T06:16:47	A really fine piece by Professor Brian Cathcart in the Guardian today,laying out with great clarity exactly what has been going on recently
JohnCleese	720981326774538241	2016-04-15T14:25:18	Funny that this should have appeared during a tour called 'Last time to see me before I die'.
JohnCleese	720971118442586112	2016-04-15T13:44:44	Apology. It was joke... The swelling is real, but it's an allergy. Started 2 days ago.
JohnCleese	720951697951092736	2016-04-15T12:27:34	Audience last night in Linkoping were a bit hostile. 
JohnCleese	720245425685577728	2016-04-13T13:41:05	This principle is resisted  by the papers,who regard Leveson as a threat to 'Freedom of the Press' - Freedom to do whatever they want......
JohnCleese	720244286172700672	2016-04-13T13:36:33	...so that only 2% of the readers of the original piece will see it  I believe Leveson will compel British papers to become more truthful
JohnCleese	720243529994272769	2016-04-13T13:33:33	If papers lose a court case (which few people can afford anyway) all they do is hide a tiny correction somewhere at the borrow of a page..
JohnCleese	720242191822667776	2016-04-13T13:28:14	The Leveson proposals are intended to make the papers print proper corrections when they get libellous stories wrong,which never happens now
JohnCleese	720241223559168000	2016-04-13T13:24:23	It's the possible (probable ) blackmail that is the scandal.The dalliance is merely the blackmail weapon the Press has probably been using
JohnCleese	720240680208068608	2016-04-13T13:22:14	Just to clarify (Since even the Huffington Post is muddled ) the Whittingdale scandal is about possible blackmail by the Press of a Minister
JohnCleese	720147162080931840	2016-04-13T07:10:37	I wish the Press would tell us...  What was the last time they spiked a story like this.David Mellor ? Oh,no...
JohnCleese	720146757615792128	2016-04-13T07:09:01	So...how are they going to blackmail Whittingdale now?  They will do anything- ANYTHING - to kill Leveson."In the public interest,of course"
JohnCleese	720145077151080448	2016-04-13T07:02:20	"Not in the public interest" ! What a load of eyewash..  It wasn't in the Press's interest,so they censored the story as long as they could
JohnCleese	720005175587577856	2016-04-12T21:46:25	Nick,I've just read your other tweets You haven't a clue  Start by trying to understand Cathcart and James Cusick 
JohnCleese	720003536289992704	2016-04-12T21:39:54	What wonderful news ! More power to their elbows.Buy Private Eye........NOW !!! ( Or,rather,tomorrow ) 
JohnCleese	720002972235776003	2016-04-12T21:37:40	You haven't understood the enormous implications.Just read Professor Brian Cathcart at Press Gazette 
JohnCleese	719915964943482880	2016-04-12T15:51:56	Interesting contribution to the debate... 
JohnCleese	719915484691501057	2016-04-12T15:50:01	Andrew....Just read Brian Cathcart's piece and all will be revealed 
JohnCleese	719892828608966656	2016-04-12T14:19:59	BBC still sitting on the biggest scandal for 50 years.Weak jobsworths.  Just read Professor Brian Cathcart's piece in The Press Gazette.
JohnCleese	719844451288489985	2016-04-12T11:07:45	Do take a look.You won't find any of this in the papers, as they are carrying out a massive censorship in the name of 'Editorial Discretion'
JohnCleese	719843969174212608	2016-04-12T11:05:50	A wonderfully clear piece in Press Gazette by Professor Brian Cathcart about the odd wall of silence concerning the Press and Whittingdale
JohnCleese	719650215742074880	2016-04-11T22:15:56	I disagree.The dam will burst and there will be cleansing on a very large scale.We just need one gutsy Dambuster...  
JohnCleese	719645629543264256	2016-04-11T21:57:43	Lovely couple in the front row at Aarhus show tonight. Held hands throughout the show, just looking...content. Plus - the guy smiled TWICE!

JohnCleese	719643170968088576	2016-04-11T21:47:56	I'm wondering if one of those 'fearless,hard-hitting' journalists at the DM,like SS or Hardstuff or M-organ, might turn out to be a hero
JohnCleese	719639705386676225	2016-04-11T21:34:10	I'm pleased how many of my friends are saying that my moaning about the press has been,to their surprise,'spot on'  When will the BBC act ?
JohnCleese	719637979346661376	2016-04-11T21:27:19	I'm tempted to ask them for a waste paper basket, but I don't want to push my luck
JohnCleese	719637411484078080	2016-04-11T21:25:03	Radisson found a lovely sharp knife. But I had to use the corkscrew they brought right away, as  "It's the only one we've got in the hotel"

JohnCleese	719634256880906245	2016-04-11T21:12:31	Staying at Aarhus Radisson.Asked room service for a sharp knife.Response 'I'll see what I can do'  Will they unearth one,against all odds ?

JohnCleese	719267707191967744	2016-04-10T20:55:59	The BBC is frightened of everyone.But this is good because it means they're frightened of us too.Make some noise !!! 
JohnCleese	719180948617760770	2016-04-10T15:11:14	Don't let us down BBC News...
JohnCleese	719172255880769536	2016-04-10T14:36:42	I'm anxious to know what Viscount Rothermere thinks about all this.Especiallywhether he's worried that the Editor of the DM might be jailed
JohnCleese	719171416386572288	2016-04-10T14:33:21	Pity about Geordie Greig chickening out.Some of us had hopes for him,believe it or not

JohnCleese	719169708566671360	2016-04-10T14:26:34	Tell us more... 
JohnCleese	719169551934582784	2016-04-10T14:25:57	They'll try to under-report it, and hope it will go away.Most of them are jobsworths.  The public must keep at them 
JohnCleese	719151199665201153	2016-04-10T13:13:01	Really ? I'm not clear how you came to that conclusion... 
JohnCleese	719150980542111746	2016-04-10T13:12:09	This is the most perfect drivel I've ever read.Corruption is destabilising,not revealing it.  
JohnCleese	719135830544097281	2016-04-10T12:11:57	I am ashamed of the people who run this country.I used to be so proud of being British.Every SINGLE newspaper collaborated in this cover-up
JohnCleese	719134585041395712	2016-04-10T12:07:00	Everything that is most corrupt about The London Press and Whittingdale is exposed today by James Cusick on the Byline website.Sickening...
JohnCleese	719051278089850880	2016-04-10T06:35:58	Thank you,LeakyJim 
JohnCleese	718941899034357761	2016-04-09T23:21:20	No." We'll kill a story if suppressing it gives us leverage over the Minister responsible for implementing Leveson" 
JohnCleese	718940756090691584	2016-04-09T23:16:48	So Paddy Ashdown is pretty much the equivalent of Robert Mugabe...I'd never got that impression 
JohnCleese	718938977080844292	2016-04-09T23:09:44	Dearest,dearest Twits...If you care even the teeniest bit about the state of Britain,do read Byline and Zelo Street this Sunday.Explosive !!
JohnCleese	718935998906920960	2016-04-09T22:57:53	zelo_street Good luck !!
JohnCleese	718834974179397632	2016-04-09T16:16:27	Normally,agree 100%  But not when the press can use it to blackmail the person responsible for implementing Leveson 
JohnCleese	718834293674532865	2016-04-09T16:13:45	Very likely.They probably did just enough... 
JohnCleese	718831714110414849	2016-04-09T16:03:30	Chris...there has been coverage on the BBC,according to: John,Myles,Richard,Ness,John and Dabe.Sorry, I'm in Jonkoping.( Sweden? )
JohnCleese	718829880356577280	2016-04-09T15:56:13	Maybe because the BBC is frightened of the Government,who are frightened of the press,who are frightened of Leveson. 
JohnCleese	718826842036244480	2016-04-09T15:44:08	Chris...are you SURE the BBC haven't covered it ? If not,will they cover the Whittingdale scandal surfacing tomorrow 
JohnCleese	718825384121397249	2016-04-09T15:38:21	Excellent... 
JohnCleese	718821716919762944	2016-04-09T15:23:47	Chris Grayling, leader of the Commons,is confused. People are not making a mountain out of a molehill ; he'd trying to do the reverse
JohnCleese	718752182498156544	2016-04-09T10:47:28	Any idea of the cost of a two-bedroom flat in downtown Reykavik. WITH central heating... 
JohnCleese	718750477861711873	2016-04-09T10:40:42	A full-blooded Tempranillo,with hints of sherry,paella and scorched heretic,and a long holier-than-thou aftertaste 
JohnCleese	718746098081378304	2016-04-09T10:23:18	From Sweden: I think the Tories would be startled by how content the Scandis seem.And the GOP wouldn't believe it... 
JohnCleese	718534516814561280	2016-04-08T20:22:33	Somebody told me tonight how much he admired,and indeed envied, the Icelandic public's response to the Panama Papers revelations.
JohnCleese	718434875687243776	2016-04-08T13:46:36	Usual problem,this time at the Elite Stora Hotel,Jonkoping.I can't find anyone in the hotel who knows how the temperature control works !!
JohnCleese	718434357946511360	2016-04-08T13:44:33	Question for the Editor of the Press Gazette : Why did the Guardian drop the Whittingdale story,only after its Editor had met with Dacre ?
JohnCleese	718433357818896384	2016-04-08T13:40:35	But they cannot take it themselves.Being so thin-skinned they hush up media stories,claiming this is not censorship,but editorial discretion
JohnCleese	718432394093707264	2016-04-08T13:36:45	Traditionally the Press hands out criticism to everyone else - politicians,civil servants,the Church,the NHS,football managers,businessmen -
JohnCleese	718431634484277249	2016-04-08T13:33:44	Evening Standard has dropped Roy Greenslade's weekly media column,as the Press 'retreats from scrutinising itself' See Press Gazette
JohnCleese	718423404634861568	2016-04-08T13:01:01	I wonder if Lord Rothermere,owner of the DM realises that his editor could now get sent to prison, as a blackmailer.Good for circulation,tho
JohnCleese	718422535130521600	2016-04-08T12:57:34	I applaud my twits. One thousand,four hundred of them 'like' Caspar,and 150 are interested in the biggest scandal since John Profumo in 1963
JohnCleese	718421430866735104	2016-04-08T12:53:11	I'm pleased you all like Caspar.An interesting name,chosen by my wife.So no arguing there  He is an cat of very little colour,who loves Fish
JohnCleese	718417305613529089	2016-04-08T12:36:47	I knew someone had taken it... 
JohnCleese	718417141364559872	2016-04-08T12:36:08	What !?!? 
JohnCleese	718378980362043392	2016-04-08T10:04:30	Our fifth child, who was born yesterday. 
JohnCleese	718336026083794945	2016-04-08T07:13:49	Will our right-wing press successfully censor all the news about their attempts to censor the Whittingdale scandal ? Er..without Leveson,yes
JohnCleese	718334618160783360	2016-04-08T07:08:13	W story all over the Internet.Try Zelo Street and Byline,It all gives a pretty clear picture of the state of Journalistic Ethics in England
JohnCleese	718333573661593600	2016-04-08T07:04:04	The DM is hushing up Whittingdalegate,in exchange for W's help over the Leveson proposals.And it's just been voted Newspaper of the Year !!!
JohnCleese	718331821033988096	2016-04-08T06:57:06	Usual hypocrisy in DM today.Dacre angry he can't name somebody in minor sex story,while he organises censorship of the Whittingdale scandal
JohnCleese	718330413316497408	2016-04-08T06:51:31	Touching to see both Ephraim Hardcastle and Seb Shakespeare sticking up for Cameron.But then the DM owners avoid paying tax in the UK too...
JohnCleese	717741738358652928	2016-04-06T15:52:20	My thanks to my friends in Northern Europe.26 out of my 27 shows now sold out.Seats only available in Brussels.Rave review in Malmo !!!!!!!!
JohnCleese	717711664469188612	2016-04-06T13:52:49	JohnCleese Quelle surprise. 
JohnCleese	717712376099946496	2016-04-06T13:55:39	...he tries to EQUATE the two.His confusion,the result of killing braincells for 50 years in traditional journalistic style,is embarrassing
JohnCleese	717709008019320833	2016-04-06T13:42:16	...and the decades-long dealing between the Camerons and a dodgy,highly secretive Panamanian law firm,used by Gaddhafi and suchlike...
JohnCleese	717708377145663488	2016-04-06T13:39:46	Poor McHardstuff. Unable to distinguish between a brief sojourn in Monaco,under the guidance of Farrer's,solicitors to Her Majesty the Queen
JohnCleese	717302642804973568	2016-04-05T10:47:31	JohnCleese philcross78 
JohnCleese	717296093608980480	2016-04-05T10:21:30	Yes,but it didn't matter because everyone else was late too,so it had to be postponed.Like the Apathy League dinner 
JohnCleese	717295481215389697	2016-04-05T10:19:04	Ole !! 
JohnCleese	717293745444634624	2016-04-05T10:12:10	Yes, English Conservatives are well ahead of the Murderous Dictators in that area,with the Camerons leading the way! 
JohnCleese	717276324507885568	2016-04-05T09:02:56	Not for me.I remember the first time Somerset won a trophy.I felt bewildered,panicky and bereft for several months 
JohnCleese	717272595666747392	2016-04-05T08:48:07	But we came last in The Worled Speling Ollimpycs... 
JohnCleese	717271996787204096	2016-04-05T08:45:44	Don't ! I derive great delight from all you Twits.Half an hour with you always puts a smile on my face.Bless you all 
JohnCleese	716717281192095744	2016-04-03T20:01:30	If you want evidence of this seemingly unlikely claim,just peruse back copies of Private Eye.It's a pity more Daily Mail readers don't do so
JohnCleese	716715829883088896	2016-04-03T19:55:44	BTW...does anyone know why Paul Dacre refers to his DM employees as female genitalia ? Odd for the editor of Britain's foremost family paper
JohnCleese	716714584401383424	2016-04-03T19:50:47	Agreed.I hope he plays for us into his 60s 
JohnCleese	716714337222729728	2016-04-03T19:49:48	Exactly ! But thanks for spelling it out... 
JohnCleese	716713845696425984	2016-04-03T19:47:51	What a wonderful match ! I'd much rather lose a game like that than win on a dodgy decision.Never been so proud of a losing England team...
JohnCleese	716520362629005312	2016-04-03T06:59:01	All is explained... 
JohnCleese	716517593117548544	2016-04-03T06:48:01	JohnCleese fantastic.. My phone is running out of ba
JohnCleese	716517464251756545	2016-04-03T06:47:30	A UK journalist tells me Paul Dacre is known in Fleet Street as 'Two-day' Dacre,now that the DM scavenges stories already printed elsewhere
JohnCleese	716515593705361408	2016-04-03T06:40:04	For travellers : If you plan to stay at the Elite Plaza Hotel in Malmo,remember to bring your own adaptor.This is not a service they provide
JohnCleese	716514284721815552	2016-04-03T06:34:52	Thanks for the many recommendations that Saleh should get a Nobel Peace Prize.But I find this one the most touching 
JohnCleese	716177204812627969	2016-04-02T08:15:26	I see Salah Abdeslam says he decided not to blow himself up,in order to save other people's lives. Is there any way we can all thank him ?
JohnCleese	715634444984590336	2016-03-31T20:18:42	Very touching...he'll certainly be up there..with the other greats. 
JohnCleese	715529816917803008	2016-03-31T13:22:56	Fantastic blog from my friend Will Travers about the trophy hunting issue &amp; what the European Union can do about it: 
JohnCleese	715506072920915969	2016-03-31T11:48:35	Just heard about Ronnie C.So sad.He had the best timing I've ever watched.He was a great, kind mentor and a wonderfully witty companion.
JohnCleese	714572731916820480	2016-03-28T21:59:50	Found a wonderful Indian restaurant in Wellington.Next time you're there,visit Great India at 141 Manners Street.Worth the detour...

JohnCleese	713135016545361920	2016-03-24T22:46:52	and get away with it for a long time,that means you're entitled to go on doing it. Like the print unions pre-Wapping,or the London press now
JohnCleese	713133812461383680	2016-03-24T22:42:04	People are amazed.But it's an example of a surprising human tendency - to believe that if you do something wrong... 
JohnCleese	713133178773372930	2016-03-24T22:39:33	Not at all,unless you make more than a million out of it.( I wish I could still do it,too,but my great age forbids ) 
JohnCleese	713132132021833729	2016-03-24T22:35:24	A lovely chap to spend time with,too.Naughty,but sweet with it

JohnCleese	712972485348569089	2016-03-24T12:01:01	I've never minded student and amateur groups using FT material,but when I find professionals making a small fortune out of it,that's not OK
JohnCleese	712971503797555201	2016-03-24T11:57:07	No.I don't have enough money yet to carry out work on the flat we bought in Bath.Didn't you realise ?    
JohnCleese	712869871302885378	2016-03-24T05:13:16	I've just read that I should have contacted them ! Sorry ! I'd assumed it would be the other way round...
JohnCleese	712869544189145088	2016-03-24T05:11:58	Warning : I have already registered the Trade Mark 'Mindy Pylon's Frying Experience' for a chain of Fish-and-Chip shops
JohnCleese	712868365879132160	2016-03-24T05:07:17	Funny ! But I wouldn't want to show such 'vitriol' towards them  Anyway, it's fun when people start talking claptrap 
JohnCleese	712865366897213440	2016-03-24T04:55:22	I'm always learning.I had never realised that 'tribute' is a synonym for 'rip-off'

JohnCleese	712447258869022720	2016-03-23T01:13:57	This is a good way of giving more publicity to the 'Faulty Towers Rip-Off Experience' I'd love more reports.Thanks

JohnCleese	712444002843418624	2016-03-23T01:01:01	Exactly.So let's give it a go,and see.... 
JohnCleese	712443828477759488	2016-03-23T01:00:19	I've heard of someone called something like this... 
JohnCleese	712431933314220033	2016-03-23T00:13:03	I've just found out from an Aussie journalist the astonishing financial success of the 'Faulty Towers Rip-Off Dining Experience'.Had no idea
JohnCleese	712431262338834433	2016-03-23T00:10:23	Let's find out for sure After all, the money should go to the best players,shouldn't it ? Or am I missing something? 
JohnCleese	712429419432951808	2016-03-23T00:03:04	Anyone can have an off-day... 
JohnCleese	712429227157688320	2016-03-23T00:02:18	And in the UK it's called the Spanish Inquisition ( Private ) 
JohnCleese	712202623710044161	2016-03-22T09:01:52	Agreed ! When do we start ? 
JohnCleese	712201126708428800	2016-03-22T08:55:55	May I assume I'm a perp ? I suspect I am,but what did I do ? I need to know if I am to offer a satisfactory apology 
JohnCleese	712200327559311361	2016-03-22T08:52:44	Yes,Billie-Jean did.And WON.So what went wrong ? 
JohnCleese	712199172879994880	2016-03-22T08:48:09	So Tories want to define 'achievement' in terms of cash.Still,even if money-minded people need to believe this, we don't have to follow suit
JohnCleese	712196161709481984	2016-03-22T08:36:11	Thanks Oz for your friendliness while I was in your great country. In one month, only ONE person shouted rude things. And that was Eric Idle

JohnCleese	710613164757364736	2016-03-17T23:45:55	JohnCleese thought grandfather.
JohnCleese	711348850775031809	2016-03-20T00:29:16	Her mother is still in hiding,as she is trying to avoid a maternity suit. 
JohnCleese	711348180810502145	2016-03-20T00:26:37	Would you prefer that I referred to my wife as Mrs John Cleese ? I thought this was considered a little out-dated... 
JohnCleese	711347531737735168	2016-03-20T00:24:02	Is this simply what Rupert and Rebekah have demanded ? Or is it a knee-jerk Conservative tendency to favour rich and powerful individuals?
JohnCleese	711345465875243009	2016-03-20T00:15:49	Odd that Cameron is trying to limit the independence of the BBC at the same time that he is hostile to independent supervision of the Press

JohnCleese	708615069387476992	2016-03-12T11:26:12	Help-a-comic-in LA !!! 
JohnCleese	708249417036337152	2016-03-11T11:13:14	I'd missed that.I was rather harassed at the time  This confirms it was a DM 'journalist' Fits the profile perfectly 
JohnCleese	707948851911479296	2016-03-10T15:18:54	I think it IS a DM journalist : there are 3 punctuation mistakes,and it's the most vulgar tweet I've ever received 
JohnCleese	707947600935190528	2016-03-10T15:13:55	Dear Drug Dealer Cat,my wife says our Maine Coons are really keen to get in touch with you.Where are you based ? 
JohnCleese	707845031831339009	2016-03-10T08:26:21	Always pleased when a DM enthusiast joins our conversation,but I would appreciate clarification of the last sentence 
JohnCleese	707844024565039104	2016-03-10T08:22:21	Special request to Idle and Cleese fans in Auckland...  Please buy any remaining tickets for second show or we'll have to do more publicity.
JohnCleese	707213627116244992	2016-03-08T14:37:22	Maybe he should take a look at the 'extremists' who support Hacked Off.Like David Attenborough,Tom Stoppard,Alan Bennett and Joanna Lumley
JohnCleese	707212647096160256	2016-03-08T14:33:29	He has a closed mind,doesn't listen and regards Hacked Off as left wing extremists. So he's a perfect choice for the Fleet Street Editors
JohnCleese	707045189567709185	2016-03-08T03:28:04	Re : Sir Alan Moses  Thank you Mira 
JohnCleese	707044623256948737	2016-03-08T03:25:49	Brilliant photo ! Thank you,Barman 
JohnCleese	707014987105980416	2016-03-08T01:28:03	Saw a sign in a wet fish shop in Perth yesterday: 'If you buy a fish here,we will throw it at you so you can say you caught it yourself'
JohnCleese	707013542273110016	2016-03-08T01:22:18	The head of IPSO,Sir Alan Moses,has betrayed the British public by becoming the puppet of the London Press Establishment.Read Zelo Street !!
JohnCleese	706819077436805121	2016-03-07T12:29:34	A funny book about the DM which R. Liddle calls ‘Magnificent’? Must be worth checking out. "According to the Daily Mail” by enterstageleft"
JohnCleese	706815711814000640	2016-03-07T12:16:12	Captured at Jamala Wildlife Lodge, near Canberra 
JohnCleese	705028023381168129	2016-03-02T13:52:34	Go and stand in the corner,Lock 
JohnCleese	703439575721480192	2016-02-27T04:40:38	Don't know anything about his,but it could be fun... 
JohnCleese	703421455338307584	2016-02-27T03:28:38	Our choices are : Sack the Conservatives ; emigrate ; stay in the EU ; or elect Corbyn  The Samaritans are going to be busy this week......
JohnCleese	703417201877868545	2016-02-27T03:11:44	This is what Murdoch told Anthony Hilton of the Evening Standard.It raises the question : Would you prefer this country was run by Rupert ?
JohnCleese	703416249825366016	2016-02-27T03:07:57	The Indie : Rupert Murdoch on why he opposes the EU... "When I go to number 10,they do what I say.When I go to Brussels they take no notice"
JohnCleese	702693440979480576	2016-02-25T03:15:46	Another thing that would account for it, is a narrow waist.I think Occam's Razor is applicable here,not a scalpel 
JohnCleese	702692705948684289	2016-02-25T03:12:51	I think you can use either now,and I prefer 'ass' It's a neater,crisper word.'Arse' sounds too much like yokel-speak 
JohnCleese	702692146449481728	2016-02-25T03:10:37	He said the picture of the unknown model was photoshopped.It wasn't,but he's one of those over-confident types... 
JohnCleese	702468179906293760	2016-02-24T12:20:39	Are you prepared to put money where your mouth is ? Because I maintain you are talking with your head up your ass... 
JohnCleese	702466703708463106	2016-02-24T12:14:48	Brilliant.English chef,of course.He mixes chicken liver with duck liver to take away some of the latter's sweetness 
JohnCleese	702465417994874881	2016-02-24T12:09:41	Slowly... 
JohnCleese	702273704017862660	2016-02-23T23:27:53	StartUp365 continues to use stolen email address to send me ads about their cheesy 'financial advice' company.Can I report this to anyone ?
JohnCleese	701753908729933825	2016-02-22T13:02:24	Here is the lovely creature 
JohnCleese	701753755797233664	2016-02-22T13:01:47	Very sad to report that Robin Birley's dog Chester, a loyal companion for over 17 years has finally kicked the bucket..
JohnCleese	701719742378176512	2016-02-22T10:46:38	I can't find a link to the DM NYC court story.All the papers co-operate in hushing up embarrassing stuff like this 
JohnCleese	701683062195806209	2016-02-22T08:20:53	This kind of classy comment raises the tone of this Twitter page.More of this please,and less mindless Python quotes 
JohnCleese	701682337151631361	2016-02-22T08:18:00	More please ! Was this to do with the MCG ? 
JohnCleese	701682013724667904	2016-02-22T08:16:43	Soap ? Chocolate ? Mitzvah ? And who are the three of you ? And why are you using a living legend as cut-price eBay 
JohnCleese	701679518264619008	2016-02-22T08:06:48	In answer to several comments,I should say that my wife,the Fish,loves Sydney too.So we can set up a menagerie a trois and all live together
JohnCleese	701678772572069888	2016-02-22T08:03:50	Robin,my secret is that at the age of 76,I have finally come out of the closet.I have fallen in love with Sydney 
JohnCleese	701659159310135296	2016-02-22T06:45:54	To encourage people to come to Brisbane's second show though,I am organising a special surprise.Don't tell Eric.It's a surprise for him too
JohnCleese	701658014516776960	2016-02-22T06:41:21	Bad news.The 3 shows Eric and I are doing in Sydney are 99% sold,100% sold and 99% sold. Plenty of room in Canberra,though.Surprise !!!!!!!!
JohnCleese	700628087029919745	2016-02-19T10:28:47	Not much news yet about the New York court case where the Mail is suing s former employee for telling what it's really like to work there
JohnCleese	700626708894863360	2016-02-19T10:23:19	When I appeared on 'Sunrise' with Eric,it was the most fun I ever had on a TV interview ! But the Mail onLine was nasty about presenter Sam
JohnCleese	700514476403994624	2016-02-19T02:57:20	I said recently that my favourite city in the world is Bath.Correction: Bath and Sydney,first equal..  Apologies to all friends in Melbourne
JohnCleese	700513465773895684	2016-02-19T02:53:19	We're holding auditions and are stunned by just how many really good, funny Aussie performers there are.The FT tour opens Aug 20th in Sydney
JohnCleese	700511072545968128	2016-02-19T02:43:49	Thanks.Camilla and I really appreciate that.C is with me here in Sydney, putting together a Fawlty Towers stage show 
JohnCleese	700224570964385792	2016-02-18T07:45:21	Close enough for Paul Dacre,anyway. 
JohnCleese	700224195112919040	2016-02-18T07:43:52	Dear Barbara sadly died two years ago.But it's the kind of minor mistake anyone could have made if they'd drunk enough. Bottoms Up Ephraim !
JohnCleese	700223429992054784	2016-02-18T07:40:49	Peter 'Hardstuff' Mackay,using an 18 month old photograph in the DM today identifies my wife Jennifer as my former wife Barbara Trentham.
JohnCleese	699312277640474624	2016-02-15T19:20:14	StartUp365 is still using stolen email addresses
JohnCleese	697232020431314948	2016-02-10T01:34:02	Thank you Jack.I applaud this,and congratulate the SNP on this astonishingly unselfish attitude 
JohnCleese	696719730657398785	2016-02-08T15:38:22	Our right-wing press derided Proportional Representation,remember ? So:  UKIP +Greens 5 million votes - 2 seats   SNP 1.5 million votes - 54
JohnCleese	696716147157241856	2016-02-08T15:24:08	I'd be against giving back all the Greeks in London too 
JohnCleese	696522114577408001	2016-02-08T02:33:07	Please don't offend me by insulting Cheese ! It's a super name and my father only changed it because he got bored 
JohnCleese	696472121028038660	2016-02-07T23:14:28	Sorry Chris,but I don't think it would work to be called 'Honky' by a person of very little colour 
JohnCleese	696469548309094400	2016-02-07T23:04:14	I've just had an idea ! I want to arrange an offending when I am in Minneapolis.Is there someone there who is prepared to call me "Honky' ?
JohnCleese	696468519173693440	2016-02-07T23:00:09	Ian,can you suggest something from today's tweets that I could be offended by, without getting too upset to eat 
JohnCleese	696467043483303937	2016-02-07T22:54:17	Just ENJOY the feeling.There is no need to rationalise it.The warm angry glow of moral superiority becomes addictive 
JohnCleese	696422378285506560	2016-02-07T19:56:48	Now, come on ! Be fair, I have made a living out of it...   
JohnCleese	696421403713736704	2016-02-07T19:52:56	Better 'out' that 'in', eh ? Adolf's motto !  Not THE Adolf,of course... 
JohnCleese	695999026295136256	2016-02-06T15:54:33	...I can follow ball-by-ball by watching the SCORECARD! England,need 8 to win,hit 2 4s !   BBC sums up "Close.England leading by one run"
JohnCleese	695996477051682816	2016-02-06T15:44:25	Trying to 'watch' the England vs SA game on the website.Technical problems for the last half hour,so no over-by-over summaries.But....
JohnCleese	695835710868299776	2016-02-06T05:05:36	This is my agent  Nag,nag,nag... 
JohnCleese	695793109024829441	2016-02-06T02:16:19	That's exactly what my agent says  Truth is... I get more good laughs each night from you lot than I'd get from TV 
JohnCleese	695791874519535617	2016-02-06T02:11:24	'Deaf' is offensive,and derogatory.I prefer to be called 'a person of apparently challenged auditory perceptions' 
JohnCleese	695790203538120705	2016-02-06T02:04:46	I straddle it with care.trying to avoid the knee-jerk posturing that allows one the warm glow of moral righteousness 
JohnCleese	695787059739496448	2016-02-06T01:52:16	Please explain yourself, strange person.The Genoese crossbowmen got their strings wet, OK ? Now,what are the symbols 
JohnCleese	695784832794816512	2016-02-06T01:43:25	There's a rumour abroad that I dislike 'Political Correctness' This is a complete distortion of my views... I absolutely fucking abhor it
JohnCleese	695783325789650944	2016-02-06T01:37:26	A lot ! I'm a bit deaf.Well..truthfully...half way to 'stone'.My left ear is a wash-out.I only use it for balancing 
JohnCleese	695781383516643328	2016-02-06T01:29:43	Sorry ! '...whispering to their own SHOES...'  First show in Malmo on April 4th.Bring your own pickled herring...
JohnCleese	695780645860208640	2016-02-06T01:26:47	My experience with Nordics is that they spend most of their time whispering to their own shows.You have to mike them 
JohnCleese	695776292554305537	2016-02-06T01:09:29	They were.But I am not bi-polar.I did the quiz in Cosmoplitan 
JohnCleese	695775140118982657	2016-02-06T01:04:54	It is also contrary to various UN resolutions.I am a person of being and of impeccable gender, and I demand my right to have people talk 2me
JohnCleese	695774095124856832	2016-02-06T01:00:45	Good point.But I don't like people talking AT me, Clever-Dick.It robs me of my Humanity an,infringes my Human Rights 
JohnCleese	695772434566377476	2016-02-06T00:54:09	Hooray ! Hooray !! Fedex have found my package  Thank you nice,kind,helpful Fedex.I won't kill myself now.I'll have a coconut sorbet instead
JohnCleese	695734288252342272	2016-02-05T22:22:35	I don't understand.Why do I have to put @ in front of things? I am not John Cleese.I AM John Cleese.I don't live AT me,I'm already there...
JohnCleese	695732772799963137	2016-02-05T22:16:33	Yes !! It's there,just above the trolley ! Hooray !!! 
JohnCleese	695732163464056832	2016-02-05T22:14:08	Because he's played a corpse on stage in a West End production, and had learned exactly how to do it.He was perfect 
JohnCleese	695596293545160704	2016-02-05T13:14:14	In particular,dear,kind,thoughtful,helpful Fedex folk,please do not send it back to the Caribbean.It was hard enough getting it out of there
JohnCleese	695595482400366592	2016-02-05T13:11:01	Help ! I  sent,via Fedex, an envelope containing a script,addressed to Victoria Strouse in Santa Monica.Please try to find it,nice Fedex....
JohnCleese	695029500141289472	2016-02-03T23:42:00	New Yorkers Alpaca lovers,heed this ! 
JohnCleese	695025564848148481	2016-02-03T23:26:22	What do you read ? 
JohnCleese	695025466944651264	2016-02-03T23:25:58	I agree.What's the point of a licence fee if they just dumb down with the rest of the herd ? 
JohnCleese	695024304820502528	2016-02-03T23:21:21	What do you read ? 
JohnCleese	695024144430292993	2016-02-03T23:20:43	Any suggestions ? What do you read ? 
JohnCleese	694923513078087683	2016-02-03T16:40:51	It's really interesting to read all your comments about British journalism and to learn just how disillusioned you are with it.What's next ?
JohnCleese	694920731218599936	2016-02-03T16:29:47	Meanwhile the Torygraph pinches an interview I gave in LA in November. Is sitting at your desk copying 2-month old stories good journalism ?
JohnCleese	694500102203928576	2016-02-02T12:38:22	Now that the DM has abandoned traditional journalism,they have to get their stories by pinching stuff off Twitter,and recycling it
JohnCleese	694498954365571072	2016-02-02T12:33:48	Here is Llama Whisperer.Jayme ! I had a 'cuddler' on 'Fierce Creatures' One of the most affectionate people I've met 
JohnCleese	694196419545165826	2016-02-01T16:31:38	From what I've been reading,I should guess this is a fairly common experience,assuming that one can persuade oneself 
JohnCleese	694188591166144512	2016-02-01T16:00:32	Re football tweets.I see today that Premier League clubs have spent more than £1billion on transfer fees this season
JohnCleese	694175790066462721	2016-02-01T15:09:40	Jayme How do I address you? Are you of any particular persuasion,gender-wise ? I keep thinking of Jayme Mansfield 
JohnCleese	694174464431513601	2016-02-01T15:04:24	Mucho,mucho mas grande que ranas ! 
JohnCleese	693999802296766464	2016-02-01T03:30:21	Where are you working, Jayme ? Do you have pictures for us ? Are the Alpacas Green Bay ones ? Why the llama paucity? 
JohnCleese	693998727548276736	2016-02-01T03:26:05	Oh, no ! They mean it as a compliment. In Peru people who have large llama turd collections are highly regarded 
JohnCleese	693984075535749120	2016-02-01T02:27:51	Apparently the Khazakhstanis call them 'Llama Turd Collectors'.  (That's what Peruvians call the Northern Irish) 
JohnCleese	693977776223838210	2016-02-01T02:02:49	No,you're thinking of Malayonnaise.They make in in KL from olive oil,egg yolks and rubber.Delicious but a bit sticky 
JohnCleese	693973849491279872	2016-02-01T01:47:13	In case people think this is a racist attack on the Malays,nothing could be further from my  has to be so careful now
JohnCleese	693973490190413824	2016-02-01T01:45:48	Exactly.But Britain now is run by people who know the price of everything and the value of nothing.Hence the malaise 
JohnCleese	693971450110287872	2016-02-01T01:37:41	How about the discrimination against Persons of  Restricted Growth ? It's the most pernicious form of height elitism 
JohnCleese	693968705336774656	2016-02-01T01:26:47	It meant the fans felt really connected with the players and the team.It wasn't all about money then.Now the Premiership is like the NBA
JohnCleese	693967232158793728	2016-02-01T01:20:56	 played at Ashton Gate,in Bristol.In 1956 they had six Bristolians in the team.I loved this 
JohnCleese	693903559629410304	2016-01-31T21:07:55	I can pronouce them,but I can't spell it
JohnCleese	693903279256899585	2016-01-31T21:06:48	No,I've gone back to Bristol City, because I can pronouce most of the players' names. 
JohnCleese	693902704997994497	2016-01-31T21:04:31	Little,as in 1,200 square feet.Or rather,1,200, minus what the three Maine Coons have staked out... 
JohnCleese	693897208450695168	2016-01-31T20:42:41	I remember one morning driving to work,and at a red light I looked around and all the other drivers were laughing.Terry was on the radio.
JohnCleese	693582640293740544	2016-01-30T23:52:42	Sad ! Where is Patrick now ? That was such a great restaurant.Patrick cooked my favourite dish,Badger and Cornflakes 
JohnCleese	693581648068218881	2016-01-30T23:48:45	In a little flat just off Sloane Square,in Chelsea,and we just got a basement flat in the Royal Crescent in Bath 
JohnCleese	693441499153981440	2016-01-30T14:31:51	Very funny,Mr HalfDuvet... 
JohnCleese	693440906205229061	2016-01-30T14:29:30	An excellent point,sir ! And if you do follow them,after a time you probably get a vague idea of where they live. 
JohnCleese	693412870726508544	2016-01-30T12:38:06	Because I stopped living in Santa Barbara six years ago,and in any case I am not interested only in local matters 
JohnCleese	693273589278228481	2016-01-30T03:24:38	No, a different idea: as Mother used to say "There's good and bad in everyone" Or JC:'Let him who is without sin...' 
JohnCleese	693271302644305920	2016-01-30T03:15:33	And it's fine by the Conservatives - in fact,a very good deal for them,because they're still second-in-charge. 
JohnCleese	693175732177076224	2016-01-29T20:55:47	I will try to become a reformed character but sometimes the letter limitation requires cheating while tweating 
JohnCleese	693175221638008833	2016-01-29T20:53:46	It's a long way to come for one show. How about a tour ? Then I'll forgive the Black Hole of Calcutta for free... 
JohnCleese	693158910660841472	2016-01-29T19:48:57	I assume you're talking about the Brummie-accented version 
JohnCleese	693158264834494465	2016-01-29T19:46:23	That made me laugh out loud.For the first time since I read the news.  You know,I used to be so proud of England 
JohnCleese	693156793690759168	2016-01-29T19:40:32	English is a lovely language.Why get it wrong? Three missing capitals,a missing conjunction,and 'stuff is people' ? 
JohnCleese	693154673805660160	2016-01-29T19:32:07	I shall tell her you said that 
JohnCleese	693153698487406592	2016-01-29T19:28:14	Dugi,I have to admit that had occurred to me.I mean, if you can own the Cabinet,why not ? 
JohnCleese	693152982444216321	2016-01-29T19:25:23	I guess I don't leave them when I am writing longhand.But you are right and I shall try to amend my ways,     Maxine 
JohnCleese	693151850774839296	2016-01-29T19:20:54	James Murdoch to head Sky already ! I thought he was still inside...
JohnCleese	693151256815243264	2016-01-29T19:18:32	Now I understand.Thank you,Nicole,and Good Luck ! 
JohnCleese	693149659297140740	2016-01-29T19:12:11	Only one spelling mistake this time,Johnny ! We're getting there...

JohnCleese	692872899288367104	2016-01-29T00:52:26	Daily Mail on Line,where Britain's middle-cless values are valiantly upheld against the assault of tabloid vulgarity 
JohnCleese	692839918012239873	2016-01-28T22:41:23	How can I find out more ? I was best friends with Mike at school in Bristol in the 1880s  Is RT Reversal Theory ?  
JohnCleese	692838310083887104	2016-01-28T22:35:00	I've been warned that we're all leaving my Daily-Mail-reading twits behind...  Both of them..  Bye bye !
JohnCleese	692837388943360004	2016-01-28T22:31:20	Yes ! Merlot-Conti,with suppler tannins than Merleau-Ponty.What have the Romanees ever done for us ? 
JohnCleese	692833707502100481	2016-01-28T22:16:42	Kathryn,you are a wonderful human being. 
JohnCleese	692784387428126720	2016-01-28T19:00:43	He loved MP because he was the only French phenomenologist to have his own sketch show "Merleau Ponty's Airborne Menagerie" It obsessed him!
JohnCleese	692781807939534848	2016-01-28T18:50:28	That's what I read in the Mail.His wife was showing some side-boob,too.`But Eric has been obsessed with MP for years 
JohnCleese	692721224418512897	2016-01-28T14:49:44	Warning to all my Twits: the new picture on Eric Idle's twitter site is not of him.It's an old photo of the French philosopher Merleau-Ponty
JohnCleese	692717364387942401	2016-01-28T14:34:24	This sound like the sort of thing Justin would approve of...  Though I think the US is in greater need  I apologise! 
JohnCleese	692526581399621632	2016-01-28T01:56:18	Thanks for all your kind piscatorial wishes.Very touching.You made an old man and a young woman happy,dear Twits 
JohnCleese	692521970366320642	2016-01-28T01:37:58	Cheeky ! But you're right,they do.It's going to be 'empty aquarium' syndrome any day now,and I'll be put  in a home 
JohnCleese	692519804884930561	2016-01-28T01:29:22	She thought it was disparaging to call them 'Mere cats',so she changed the spelling.If only she'd copyrighted it... 
JohnCleese	692518911271649283	2016-01-28T01:25:49	No,it's one of the current ones 
JohnCleese	692518694937829376	2016-01-28T01:24:57	When I said "I have to keep this short.I'm on stage in front of 2,500 people"...she said "Yes,I know"  
JohnCleese	692384390597443585	2016-01-27T16:31:17	It's not called Eric.It is a person of traditionally feminine gender,and her name is Jennifer and she is 67 today !! 
JohnCleese	692380176819326976	2016-01-27T16:14:32	Happy Birthday to my Fish !!
JohnCleese	691798972340506624	2016-01-26T01:45:02	Let's see what Jerry Hall can do... 
JohnCleese	691795605816000513	2016-01-26T01:31:40	Try shining spotlights on the Press,when they control IPSO,which was set up by them,to make themselves behave better 
JohnCleese	691791665229631489	2016-01-26T01:16:00	Care ? 
JohnCleese	691785176251260928	2016-01-26T00:50:13	Seriously,we all know what happened to Vince Cable when he said he'd stand up to Murdoch.Cameron just had him replaced.This is Britain today
JohnCleese	691783553164644353	2016-01-26T00:43:46	Obviously Murdoch and Osborne were discussing their concern that 85% of the British press is controlled by three foreign based billionaires
JohnCleese	691615434752315394	2016-01-25T13:35:43	You're right Raphael ! Silly me ! Blame age,the lateness of the hour,and Chateau de Chasselas 
JohnCleese	691614557052276740	2016-01-25T13:32:14	I'd just been watching Trump !  Thank you 
JohnCleese	691428205799043072	2016-01-25T01:11:45	I asked an Aussie why they're asking Her Majesty to abdicate.He says they're embarrassed having to admit they've got an old Queen in charge
JohnCleese	691425230011654145	2016-01-25T00:59:55	That's right,but she refused point blank to tell me where she got hers from.If only I could have found the source... 
JohnCleese	691424842290237441	2016-01-25T00:58:23	What a shame ! I loved you name.My Dad changed the family name from Cheese.I 'd prefer to be a fermented curd.Sad... 
JohnCleese	691422897362112512	2016-01-25T00:50:39	Cleverdick... 
JohnCleese	691043967371186176	2016-01-23T23:44:55	They're all old unless you haven't heard them 
JohnCleese	691043327735664641	2016-01-23T23:42:22	Brilliant !!!! 
JohnCleese	691042728742879233	2016-01-23T23:40:00	Brilliant !!! 
JohnCleese	691039495899185152	2016-01-23T23:27:09	Thinking of Andy Coulson...I think it's great when people want to give something back to society.
JohnCleese	691037991138099204	2016-01-23T23:21:10	And thank you too,Chris.But what claim do you have to Pythonhood ? We had to license it from the Oracle at Delphi 
JohnCleese	691037118655795201	2016-01-23T23:17:42	And not as pompous as 'antepenultimate',which is an execrable exemplar of sesquipedalianism,Monsieur Grenouille ! 
JohnCleese	691035990274744320	2016-01-23T23:13:13	This seems to be the best bet. Coulson has set up a PR company.So... now he's going to teach other people to lie  
JohnCleese	690965657517735936	2016-01-23T18:33:44	Can anyone explain to me why my last-but-one- tweet is 'unavailable' ?
JohnCleese	690623671338139648	2016-01-22T19:54:49	My profoundest thanks to JK Rowling and Max Mosley for providing the chance for Britain to have a better,fairer and more optimistic press
JohnCleese	690282034296668161	2016-01-21T21:17:16	Barry,it was a joke.Tip:  if you don't 'get' a joke,and bright people are laughing,it's smart to stay nice and quiet 
JohnCleese	690254423537352704	2016-01-21T19:27:33	I implore all my British twits to read Zelo Street today.Please,please,please.......
JohnCleese	689999694056026112	2016-01-21T02:35:21	You see,I was right.I'm for it now... 
JohnCleese	689937200566378496	2016-01-20T22:27:01	At last,,,a shaft of hope (from someone from the Worldwide Cleese Tribe 
JohnCleese	689858624508796931	2016-01-20T17:14:47	For those who don't know what the DailyMail is like, here's a potted history JohnCleese 
JohnCleese	689837708060053505	2016-01-20T15:51:40	Are you saying worms are frigid ? This is deeply offensive to invertebrates.Worms do a fine and often thankless job 
JohnCleese	689836154011697152	2016-01-20T15:45:30	Remember,the Daily Mail is in court tomorrow in New York ! They're defending themselves against accusations of behaving like the Daily Mail
JohnCleese	689834866452631553	2016-01-20T15:40:23	I'm afraid so.The entire organising committee committed suicide,so it has been cancelled.It's a mournful business..  
JohnCleese	689833896737902592	2016-01-20T15:36:32	You people are always kvetching.Look,you don't have a mind.You have a brain.What you think is your mind is imaginary 
JohnCleese	689579223506354176	2016-01-19T22:44:33	I find my tweets tonight are inhibited by my fear of giving offence to people of gender
JohnCleese	689577787494158336	2016-01-19T22:38:50	They're not talking about our chess,Eric.It's a new American game called Extreme Contact Cage Chess.Catching on fast 
JohnCleese	689575194990637056	2016-01-19T22:28:32	I apologise for my last tweet.It was reprehensible,and tasteless and politically incorrect and probably racist.My only excuse is :It's funny
JohnCleese	689574366095499264	2016-01-19T22:25:15	Nine Israeli travel agents are suspected of fixing high prices for students wanting to travel to Auschwitz.You've got to laugh,haven't you ?
JohnCleese	689573586848317441	2016-01-19T22:22:09	I see Palin has endorsed Trump.
JohnCleese	689266061376622592	2016-01-19T02:00:09	Hallo Aussies ! Eric and I are adding shows in all major cities except Canberra.Jocks and politicians,right ? Not much of a soh ? No worries
JohnCleese	689197674663383040	2016-01-18T21:28:24	That is brilliant ! What shall I call my next ? "Surrounded by Fools" "24 hours from Normal" Michael Palin's Dairies 
JohnCleese	689192894775840777	2016-01-18T21:09:25	An ex-employee has made allegations against the Mail ; it claims he made made them up maliciously.  But isn't that why the Mail HIRED him ??
JohnCleese	689191217624674310	2016-01-18T21:02:45	The Daily Mail is in court in New York on Thursday,defending itself against allegations of unethical and unprofessional behaviour !!
JohnCleese	689172730328051712	2016-01-18T19:49:17	Isn't my twitter page a site ? I don't understand . But I am passionate about ceviche, violet and radical moderation 
JohnCleese	689171524117463042	2016-01-18T19:44:30	Its ringing a bell,or at least tolling one.Give me a clue 
JohnCleese	689170643653398528	2016-01-18T19:41:00	Did you read Terry Gilliam's,then.  He drew it himself ! 
JohnCleese	689170237577629697	2016-01-18T19:39:23	AllyHirschlag Ally - and I'm always looking for friends - my hint is : Tooky hebub. (anag ) p 357
JohnCleese	689167137525608448	2016-01-18T19:27:04	Dear Squideye and Jeromy French....Thanks,Gracias,Danke schon,Merci,Grazie,Shodvink srapootrfish cettlebom yaktoper 
JohnCleese	689101797403787264	2016-01-18T15:07:26	I'm quite proud that my tweets have received 23 million 'impressions' in the last 4 weeks. I only wish I knew what it meant.Impressionists?
JohnCleese	689100862241792000	2016-01-18T15:03:43	I wonder why,for the first time,one of my tweets has become 'unavailable'.Will my Scandi friends tell me if the word 'Viking' is racist ?
JohnCleese	689099387537068033	2016-01-18T14:57:51	Disappointed by Twitter's news values.There are better items for my site than a 2011 pap story,and an 18-month-old one-day put-down of Moron
JohnCleese	688442087176560640	2016-01-16T19:25:58	I wish I'd said that 
JohnCleese	688168730849746950	2016-01-16T01:19:45	JohnCleese Spitbucketrichy I wish I had said that!
JohnCleese	688169905825296384	2016-01-16T01:24:25	Stop pretending you're related to me,Damo 
JohnCleese	688168230871904256	2016-01-16T01:17:46	Are you by any chance related to Oscar Wilde ? 
JohnCleese	688167676108132352	2016-01-16T01:15:34	Very good ! Didn't see that one coming... And the Guardian is one of the few papers not hushing up this nastiness 
JohnCleese	688166105462915072	2016-01-16T01:09:19	Disappointingly illiterate and inaccurate, but nevertheless good to have a journalist contribute.Good luck in re-hab 
JohnCleese	688132169529602049	2016-01-15T22:54:28	You may ask "How can they look themselves in the mirror every morning"  Answer : "Easily,because they are sociopaths"  I hope they'll sue..
JohnCleese	688130870180364292	2016-01-15T22:49:18	It shows that Sun journalism is heading back to its worst excesses,led by Tony Gallager. He was recently appointed Editor by Rebekah Brooks
JohnCleese	688123869840838657	2016-01-15T22:21:29	The whole nauseating tale of cajoling,and then lying,and then threatening,is told in all its scummy detail on the excellent Zelo Street site
JohnCleese	688122659373121538	2016-01-15T22:16:41	The horrible story about the Lineker family in the Sun was entirely invented by Editor Tony Gallagher and show biz 'Editor' Natalie Edwards
JohnCleese	687763187534544897	2016-01-14T22:28:16	I think this strange Viking contribution is a rather poor example of science as a method of inquiry. 
JohnCleese	687761162939822080	2016-01-14T22:20:13	I love the original idea of scepticism as a philosophy,but its meaning has changed to imply opposition to something 
JohnCleese	687758353091670016	2016-01-14T22:09:03	Thanks for comments.I'm puzzled by the difference between a skeptic and a sceptic.Does the former require certainty,while the latter doesn't
JohnCleese	687756461221490688	2016-01-14T22:01:32	Tell me more,but be a little more specific if you can 
JohnCleese	687755822001164289	2016-01-14T21:59:00	If you are referring to Popper's ideas I am right with you 
JohnCleese	687743574021148672	2016-01-14T21:10:20	I'm interested.Why do you think he is a 'poor source of info' Ai least he doesn't think science is a belief system 
JohnCleese	687737997446483969	2016-01-14T20:48:10	I'm touring Europe in three months,so contact the London Speakers Bureau.They have my schedule 
JohnCleese	687655869509693445	2016-01-14T15:21:49	JohnCleese When Piers was on CNN I actually tore the tv plug out of the wall because I couldn't find the remote. Dark times.
JohnCleese	687735963674611712	2016-01-14T20:40:05	Thanks Kat-Lady 
JohnCleese	687730580482568193	2016-01-14T20:18:42	How can I find out more about this,John ? 
JohnCleese	687730062842531840	2016-01-14T20:16:39	How about the September 2015 edition of Nature ? The famous one with the cartoon  Does that count ? 
JohnCleese	687712392831209472	2016-01-14T19:06:26	You can find most of the story - at least four whistleblowers - on Byline
JohnCleese	687712072092770304	2016-01-14T19:05:09	Surprising that the Independent is the only London newspaper to carry the development in the Rebecca Brooks story.Censorship by the press ?
JohnCleese	687655425949470721	2016-01-14T15:20:04	I hear Piers Morgan didn't like the Specsavers ad.That's OK. I didn't like his Insider Trading,even if the Mail had no qualms about it
JohnCleese	687442112527360001	2016-01-14T01:12:26	I'm doing a Creativity seminar in Minneapolis in a few weeks.Can anyone from that area tell me how I can get a licence to hunt a dentist ?
JohnCleese	687438240878587904	2016-01-14T00:57:03	Heard about the amazing replicability crisis in science ? The papers aren't interested.If you are, visit http:/sciencesetfree.tumblr.com
JohnCleese	687434211880513541	2016-01-14T00:41:02	So pleased that Bob Mortimer and Vic Reeves aref on tour again.Two of the most original comics the UK has produced - nothing else like them
JohnCleese	686189273545052160	2016-01-10T14:14:06	The left brain rules ! 
JohnCleese	685818771144052737	2016-01-09T13:41:51	Is 'kipper' an antonym for 'insomniac' ?
JohnCleese	685538835569205248	2016-01-08T19:09:29	Will you all please start following Dawn French immediately? Nought to five million in 60 seconds sort of thing.Go!  
JohnCleese	685508246422065152	2016-01-08T17:07:56	Top Comedy site The Interrobang rates “Together Again…” in the Best Ten Comedy Tours of 2015.Aussie fans please note 
JohnCleese	685258398296883200	2016-01-08T00:35:08	Maybe there are two types of people : those who believe in the concept of 'enough money'; and those who are miserable (but highly motivated)
JohnCleese	685233690901884928	2016-01-07T22:56:57	But is that some organisations don't regard 'sufficient profit' as sufficient ? Or would that be insufficient profit 
JohnCleese	685119349754081284	2016-01-07T15:22:36	Remember though...Whoever has the most things when he dies,WINS !!
JohnCleese	685119188566970368	2016-01-07T15:21:58	Incidentally,I saw Rupert Murdoch recently in Mustique.He's absolutely TINY ! We're talking quantum particles..  So all is finally explained
JohnCleese	685117526657921024	2016-01-07T15:15:21	I'm sure all my 5.04 Million twit-followers would want to wish Charlie Mayfield a Sufficiently Prosperous New Year...and a VERY Happy One
JohnCleese	685115130024214528	2016-01-07T15:05:50	A Merry International Silly Walk Day to all my twits This event is endorsed by the All-American Chiropractic and Sports-Injuries Association
JohnCleese	685096859111690240	2016-01-07T13:53:14	Charlie Mayfield of John Lewis says 'Maximisation of profit is not our goal.Our aim is to make sufficient profit.' An outbreak of sanity !!!
JohnCleese	684735111485587457	2016-01-06T13:55:46	I like 'hard of tweeting' I shall steal it and use it profusely 
JohnCleese	684492223640125440	2016-01-05T21:50:38	I keep finding myself wondering "What sort of qualifications does one need in order to become Greg Dyke ?"
JohnCleese	684490884864409600	2016-01-05T21:45:18	Oh,yes ! And slowly,too.But only,maybe,four or five million.Stalin wouldn't have crossed the road to kill that many. 
JohnCleese	684489802251681792	2016-01-05T21:41:00	I was too.Pity it wasn't me 
JohnCleese	684489100003508224	2016-01-05T21:38:13	It could only be a disappointment.And I don't have the energy any more.But I'm delighted it still makes people laugh 
JohnCleese	684488127629623299	2016-01-05T21:34:21	That's good.I never heard that one ! 
JohnCleese	684485263914041345	2016-01-05T21:22:58	This is too clever for me,Steve.Could you explain ? 
JohnCleese	684484691861368832	2016-01-05T21:20:42	Yes it does,but as we all know,Hitler and Stalin and Mao killed more than the Church of England could ever aspire to 
JohnCleese	684483418923659266	2016-01-05T21:15:38	I agree.But I shudder to think of the obstacles he faces within his church.Still,it's lovely to have moments of Hope

JohnCleese	684372315547779074	2016-01-05T13:54:09	My other hope for 2016 is that organised religion will start trying to put the 'Christ' back into 'Christianity' Uphill struggle though...
JohnCleese	684371093453406209	2016-01-05T13:49:18	Interesting criticisms of Specsavers ad.Someone asks " Why was one of the policemen wearing a Royal Engineers insignia on his cap ?" Sorry !
