HaimBodek	696808615311773696	2016-02-08T21:31:34	Ya know, I think I am gonna blame Rita Hayworth for HFT also. 
HaimBodek	696801156241190912	2016-02-08T21:01:56	mechmarkets daveweisberger But keep in mind that the orig concept of Thor used HFT weaponry for RBC custs. IEX is keeping w/ tradition (2)
HaimBodek	696800487979483143	2016-02-08T20:59:16	mechmarkets daveweisberger I probably agree w/ u guys on IEX marketing being at odds w/ the provision of tools to pick off the mkt. (1)
HaimBodek	696798819300806656	2016-02-08T20:52:39	daveweisberger Then IEX fits right into the exch innovation tradition competing w/ features favoring one type of participant over others(5)
HaimBodek	696798402567401472	2016-02-08T20:50:59	daveweisberger If we are going to have a liberal interpretation of Reg NMS w/ post only iso, queue jumping, 1sec exceptions,latency arb(4)
HaimBodek	696797920197271552	2016-02-08T20:49:04	daveweisberger So I don't see much of a prob w/ IEX innovating to upset the apple cart&amp;eating into the value of the HFT latency premium (3)
HaimBodek	696797543393529858	2016-02-08T20:47:34	daveweisberger However,exchs compete heavily creating asym environments forcing all exchs to adopt perverse features(eg post only isos) (2)
HaimBodek	696796569241264128	2016-02-08T20:43:42	daveweisberger Generally,I don't like exch routers w/ exclusive advantages over other members as I indicated in my R611 comment letter (1)
HaimBodek	695730785870073856	2016-02-05T22:08:40	mkt_strctr_guy Just saying you will never beat ISO sweep w/o short term quant alpha no matter how much anti-HFT feature u build into mkt(4)
HaimBodek	695730513567485953	2016-02-05T22:07:35	mkt_strctr_guy Don't get me wrong. I see latency arb oriented strats as a scam. (3)
HaimBodek	695730185451237376	2016-02-05T22:06:16	mkt_strctr_guy Lat arb speedbumps will just move the bleed from HFT slippage over micros to quant strat slippage over millis
HaimBodek	695730027980333056	2016-02-05T22:05:39	mkt_strctr_guy There is no way to avoid short term adverse selection w/o short term alpha. (1)
HaimBodek	695728889566511104	2016-02-05T22:01:07	mkt_strctr_guy The better firms aren't waiting until the ISO sweep to cancel. They are off that side of the market 500ms beforehand

HaimBodek	695665320908955649	2016-02-05T17:48:31	If those IEX SOR msecs really matter to u,your biz model is already obsolete.No different than those fighting to protect floor in 2005 (4)
HaimBodek	695664781966118912	2016-02-05T17:46:23	Sort of like having one more HFT nudge themselves into the club in 2011, no? (3)
HaimBodek	695664637363298305	2016-02-05T17:45:49	Yeah a smart router aimed at the other exchs is irritating, increases sweep risk, especially when combined with an exclusive edge. (2)
HaimBodek	695664232424202242	2016-02-05T17:44:12	IEX is so much less a threat to exch competition than BATS wuz to NYSE. Anyone complaining about IEX app is showing their hand (1)
