jbouie	724945388168470532	2016-04-26T12:57:04	Sorry, my mistake, 25 years. That's still a long-ass time.

jbouie	724945249743835136	2016-04-26T12:56:31	harryh I think that's fair
jbouie	724945124967460864	2016-04-26T12:56:01	In NC, for instance, a teacher with a masters + certification can top out at $61K (from a start of $42K) after 34 years. 34!
jbouie	724944896294051841	2016-04-26T12:55:06	ArthurBarnhouse also, they aren't paid for those months off!
jbouie	724944539853688832	2016-04-26T12:53:41	A related problem are the salary schedules in states like NC and VA. Takes *decades* to get from base pay to something reasonable.
jbouie	724944300581224449	2016-04-26T12:52:44	Which, watching my fiancee work and prep for her classroom, is insane.

jbouie	724943859256532993	2016-04-26T12:50:59	harryh And again, "summer vacation" is unpaid.
jbouie	724943700187578373	2016-04-26T12:50:21	harryh A $35,000 starting salary for a college educated worker that grows to $50K over 35 years is bad.
jbouie	724943426735722496	2016-04-26T12:49:16	harryh "summer vacation" is the equivalent of a 2 month (at most) furlough that usually includes some amount of training and prep.

jbouie	724942756406300673	2016-04-26T12:46:36	jbouie People think of teaching as a calling rather than a profession which instills the idea that they should be very self sacrificing.
jbouie	724942819748642819	2016-04-26T12:46:51	GroverManheim I think this would disadvantage elementary and middle school teachers quite a bit.
jbouie	724942603637145601	2016-04-26T12:46:00	StefanSasse Which seems totally reasonable to me.
jbouie	724942515997167618	2016-04-26T12:45:39	harryh The average obscures the extent to which new teachers are paid very little.
jbouie	724942058612477952	2016-04-26T12:43:50	NEwertKrocker Which, at least for the teachers I know, isn't a problem. They just would like to be compensated for it!

jbouie	723630592923959297	2016-04-22T21:52:32	Elite liberal conversation definitely is. Elite liberal conversation ≠ liberalism.

jbouie	723628888195235840	2016-04-22T21:45:45	Smug liberalism is influential and annoying among a narrow segment of college educated urban types.
jbouie	723628748864626690	2016-04-22T21:45:12	And people mistake influence *among themselves* with meaningful influence at large.

jbouie	723180704792739840	2016-04-21T16:04:50	No, it doesn't. 
jbouie	723180587050254336	2016-04-21T16:04:22	Kaine is more liberal and less of a Wall Street guy than Warner. 
jbouie	723180401804623872	2016-04-21T16:03:38	He's almost wasted in the Senate, in a lot of ways.
jbouie	723180242689490944	2016-04-21T16:03:00	He's an able former executive and solid legislator with strong relationships and two feet firmly in the party structure up and down ballot.
jbouie	723180061101314049	2016-04-21T16:02:17	Okay, beyond qualifications, the case for Tim Kaine is that—like Biden—he's 100% suited to the role of the modern vice president.
jbouie	723179592522014720	2016-04-21T16:00:25	TwanTargaryen I think he's too inexperienced.
jbouie	723179252095528960	2016-04-21T15:59:04	whyyyy would you dooooo this? does no one understand hot gotdamn influential a powerful senator can be? 
jbouie	723179150421446656	2016-04-21T15:58:40	VP choices never enhance electability only undermine it. "Do no harm" is the first rule of a pick. 
jbouie	723178910821666816	2016-04-21T15:57:43	jbouie on that note, Booker is possibly the most popular non-prez candidate among Silicon Valley elites going by FEC records

jbouie	723177447328374784	2016-04-21T15:51:54	Kaine has been good VA gov, held nutjob GOP at bay. Screwy VA governor elections mean he can't be re-elected. 
jbouie	723177748928311296	2016-04-21T15:53:05	ChrisHornb nah, if a special election is held this year, that seat is safe.

jbouie	723177036420919296	2016-04-21T15:50:16	Yeah, if you back or are sympathetic to Sanders than Booker is like the worst possible choice here. 
jbouie	723176405824069632	2016-04-21T15:47:45	noonanville and to answer your question, "less."
jbouie	723176289591549953	2016-04-21T15:47:18	I'm also not going to go into it (again), but I think Tim Kaine is simultaneously the most rational and best choice for VP.
jbouie	723176122729508864	2016-04-21T15:46:38	noonanville deleting that last reply because I think I misread your tweet. Sorry!
jbouie	723175001499807744	2016-04-21T15:42:10	Warren is an excellent senator who stands to be a very powerful one in 2017. That's way more important than VP. 
jbouie	723174863339397120	2016-04-21T15:41:38	(Or other Republicans, for the other side.)
jbouie	723174817357246464	2016-04-21T15:41:27	So pick the person who could best do the job and doesn't alienate other Democrats.
jbouie	723174764576169984	2016-04-21T15:41:14	In an era of polarization and negative partisanship, balancing and such just doesn't matter.
jbouie	723174645290176512	2016-04-21T15:40:46	And as I say all the time, I think the only value that matters for picking a VP is whether the person could be president.
jbouie	723174077247160320	2016-04-21T15:38:30	(This also goes for Sherrod Brown)
jbouie	723173833155420160	2016-04-21T15:37:32	For the life of me I will never understand liberals who don't want to keep Warren in the Senate. 
jbouie	723173298142646272	2016-04-21T15:35:24	TimFernholz huh, that is plausible!

jbouie	723157585537458176	2016-04-21T14:32:58	Kaiten1978 ah, I think that is very wrong
jbouie	723157067243106304	2016-04-21T14:30:55	That’s it for now, more later on this book.

jbouie	723156172602249216	2016-04-21T14:27:21	Basic premise is that the New Deal era was an anomaly—product of profound deprivation of the Depression, which submerged potent divisions…
jbouie	723155692530618368	2016-04-21T14:25:27	I will say more about this later, but Jefferson Cowie’s “The Great Exception” is a must read for anyone on or of the left in the US.

jbouie	723141439291576320	2016-04-21T13:28:49	emmettrensin and the central tension of the new deal coalition was the inclusion of black Americans
jbouie	723141361231380480	2016-04-21T13:28:30	emmettrensin of course it doesn’t. but attempted inclusion of minorities in 30s and 40s unionization nearly tore unions apart
jbouie	723141197670277120	2016-04-21T13:27:51	emmettrensin And “white working class doesn’t really have a group mind” is a non-response in a discussion of broad demographic trends.
jbouie	723141030502121472	2016-04-21T13:27:11	emmettrensin Yeah, but here the over determination is tied tightly to race.
jbouie	723139538466562049	2016-04-21T13:21:15	I am just starting this but I’ll say the white working class abandoned Dems over attempted inclusion of minorities.

jbouie	722602002954366977	2016-04-20T01:45:17	...is to just abuse language. It is not suppression or disenfranchisement to adhere to straightforward and fairly applied electoral rules.
jbouie	722601819604692992	2016-04-20T01:44:33	It should be easy and straightforward to participate in party primaries. But to call broad limits—closed primaries, mainly—"suppression"...
jbouie	722601058258796544	2016-04-20T01:41:32	jbouie *particularly* in primaries where most races are decided.
jbouie	722600960812523520	2016-04-20T01:41:08	jbouie agree w all of that. NY is a different beast entirely, but it's one that, for its own reasons has been designed to keep turnout low
jbouie	722600264901988353	2016-04-20T01:38:23	MattBruenig jbouie noonanville Wrong. Specification of narrow evidentiary routes to eligibility is different in kind from deadlines.
jbouie	722600831661535232	2016-04-20T01:40:38	And beyond that, federal elections exist under an entirely different standard of scrutiny than party primaries.
jbouie	722600614128001024	2016-04-20T01:39:46	More broadly, targeted requirements for *any participation*—that are intended to be burdensome—are different in kind from deadlines.
jbouie	722600107821109248	2016-04-20T01:37:45	This just isn't equivalent to closed primaries or reasonable deadlines for registration. (With quick note that 6-month party switch is bad)

jbouie	722586373094387712	2016-04-20T00:43:11	Yes. "suppression" and "disenfranchisement" are actual things that are distinct from questions of primary design. 
jbouie	722586204294619136	2016-04-20T00:42:30	This is common. Fundamental misunderstanding of what a presidential primary is. It is not first stage voting.

jbouie	722576608217837568	2016-04-20T00:04:22	"You should belong to the party whose primary you want to vote in" isn't "arbitrary." 
jbouie	722576515620163584	2016-04-20T00:04:00	As a general rule, "Oh shit, I forgot to register" is not disenfranchisement.  
jbouie	722576009594187776	2016-04-20T00:02:00	That you're not eligible to vote in a primary because you chose to be an independent isn't disenfranchisement. 
jbouie	722571267308519424	2016-04-19T23:43:09	Probably not. But "not being able to vote for your favorite candidate" doesn't equal "disenfranchisement."

jbouie	722492042488713216	2016-04-19T18:28:20	jbouie bdbreedlove This is what a closed primary that disenfranchised voters looked like  
jbouie	722492162471030790	2016-04-19T18:28:49	anthonyresnick Because the actual general election is meaningless. There is no option for people who aren't Democrats.
jbouie	722491949605896193	2016-04-19T18:27:58	Congrats, I guess? 
jbouie	722491880164978688	2016-04-19T18:27:42	emmettrensin But caucuses, by their design, are extremely undemocratic. They filter out all but people with time and resources.
jbouie	722491442057318400	2016-04-19T18:25:57	emmettrensin It is an argument about popular will, and when juxtaposed with an argument against closed primaries it shows a tension.
jbouie	722491264990593026	2016-04-19T18:25:15	SamAdlerBell fair!
jbouie	722491144240832512	2016-04-19T18:24:46	But in circumstances like a presidential primary, the case for openness *as a rule* just doesn't hold up.
jbouie	722490985553469440	2016-04-19T18:24:08	There are exceptions to this. In DC, the Democratic mayoral primary is the election. Here, I think it should be open.
jbouie	722490790648422404	2016-04-19T18:23:22	Because party primaries are mechanisms for choosing nominees, not first-stage elections. 
jbouie	722490648146919425	2016-04-19T18:22:48	MattYaspan prof_carrington that is a distinct issue that is disenfranchisement!
jbouie	722490439966859264	2016-04-19T18:21:58	This, precisely. 
jbouie	722490401349885952	2016-04-19T18:21:49	That's fair! But then you're making a choice not to be affiliated with a party. 
jbouie	722490284530130944	2016-04-19T18:21:21	emmettrensin Err, everywhere on social media. "Bernie has won 8 of 9 last primaries." "Closed primary is unfair."
jbouie	722489882510245888	2016-04-19T18:19:45	emmettrensin "Our consistent caucus wins show that we are the majority choice but closed primaries are unfair and undemocratic."
jbouie	722489695050055680	2016-04-19T18:19:01	Part of the problem really is that primaries are quasi-public events on behalf of quasi-public institutions.
jbouie	722489545317597184	2016-04-19T18:18:25	Again, in the context of a presidential primary, no one is being "disenfranchised" here. 
jbouie	722489083247923202	2016-04-19T18:16:35	emmettrensin But I find it hard to take "closed primaries are bad" from folks who were championing caucus victories two weeks ago.
jbouie	722488966876946432	2016-04-19T18:16:07	emmettrensin I mean, the anti-closed primary. I, myself, am pro-closed primaries and pro-caucuses b/c majoritarianism ≠ democracy
jbouie	722488597274824704	2016-04-19T18:14:39	emmettrensin You'll forgive me if I think the anti-open primary argument is extremely opportunistic in this particular case.
jbouie	722487931655467009	2016-04-19T18:12:00	DavidAParker9 Oh, and congrats, you're blocked.
jbouie	722487898998775808	2016-04-19T18:11:52	DavidAParker9 
jbouie	722487685957423104	2016-04-19T18:11:02	You can totally vote for whoever you want in the general election! 
jbouie	722487609461764096	2016-04-19T18:10:43	DavidAParker9 Everyone can make silly analogies.
jbouie	722487540171845632	2016-04-19T18:10:27	WilliamFreeland ThusBloggedA TrexPushups pareene Please take this out of my mentions.
jbouie	722487287121100800	2016-04-19T18:09:27	DavidAParker9 Nah, I really don't.
jbouie	722487197371351042	2016-04-19T18:09:05	Which is totally fair. I do not *begrudge* independents. But if that's how you are going to roll, then you are giving up something too!
jbouie	722486855082635265	2016-04-19T18:07:44	It's not a restriction on voting that you can't participate in a primary, sans party ID. 
jbouie	722486667945361408	2016-04-19T18:06:59	theseantcollins I think that's fair, and why I think open primaries make sense for local elections.
jbouie	722486333583802368	2016-04-19T18:05:39	We are looking at people who are partisans, but just don't want to have to say they're on one side or another.
jbouie	722486160845586433	2016-04-19T18:04:58	So we're not looking at people who are independent *in practice*...
jbouie	722485833354330112	2016-04-19T18:03:40	One reason I am unsympathetic to self-described "independents" is because they tend to be reliable partisan voters on either side.
jbouie	722485676063776768	2016-04-19T18:03:02	RobbTufts No.
jbouie	722485353479868416	2016-04-19T18:01:46	RobbTufts This is silly and you know it.
jbouie	722484350567190528	2016-04-19T17:57:46	It really isn't, but thanks for reading. 
jbouie	722452185137569792	2016-04-19T15:49:58	SWGoldman also, underlying idea of Constitution is that majoritarianism and democracy are not synonyms.
jbouie	722451447464488964	2016-04-19T15:47:02	Basic tension in US politics: the Constitution provides for a federal and republican govt, not a national and democratic state. Discuss.
jbouie	722451386349137921	2016-04-19T15:46:47	But in the specific occasion of a POTUS primary, where the partisanship of your state has no real bearing, I think the case is way weaker.
jbouie	722451068588691456	2016-04-19T15:45:31	There are times when open primaries make sense! One-party cities, gubernatorial elections in one-party states, etc.
jbouie	722450854188417024	2016-04-19T15:44:40	_johncarlo In this particular instance, however, it isn't the only game in town.
jbouie	722450255984197632	2016-04-19T15:42:18	This! 
jbouie	722449687727443968	2016-04-19T15:40:02	jbouie CGP Grey has good coverage of how two-party systems happen in first past the post and how ranked votes work. 
jbouie	722448495915847681	2016-04-19T15:35:18	god yes 
jbouie	722447590189445120	2016-04-19T15:31:42	jbouie Not to mention registered independents have representation. They have the right to vote in elections.
jbouie	722447796670844928	2016-04-19T15:32:31	Maybe I should write a quick primer on why a winner-take-all system without ranked choices leads inevitably and immediately to two choices?
jbouie	722447662734188544	2016-04-19T15:31:59	Again, blame winner-take-all without ranked choices. 
jbouie	722447552398819328	2016-04-19T15:31:33	jasonmcclellan Already answered that question, look at my replies.
jbouie	722447461059432448	2016-04-19T15:31:11	Your beef is with winner-take-all voting without ranked choices, not with the parties per se. 
jbouie	722446390467506177	2016-04-19T15:26:56	I don't have a problem with the caucus process, but yeah. Curious inconsistency. 
jbouie	722445704547934213	2016-04-19T15:24:13	jbouie Also, winning a primary doesn't empower anyone to levy taxes.
jbouie	722445374225428484	2016-04-19T15:22:54	As long as non-affiliated voters have a reasonable opportunity to choose a party, I don't see the problem. 
jbouie	722445121413730306	2016-04-19T15:21:53	chelseaadelaine :-)
jbouie	722445005067915265	2016-04-19T15:21:26	Preventing a ton of Democrats from meddling in the GOP primary, and vice versa.  
jbouie	722444826055020545	2016-04-19T15:20:43	You chose to be an independent voter. 
jbouie	722444502091169792	2016-04-19T15:19:26	I agree. I would move up party switch deadline to two or three months before, and have same-day registration. 
jbouie	722443640744730624	2016-04-19T15:16:00	I guess I am a crazy person who thinks political parties should be allowed to limit their primaries to members? 
jbouie	722442885803565057	2016-04-19T15:13:00	RamblinDash I do, but again, I don't think this process ought to be purely majoritarian
jbouie	722442253583560704	2016-04-19T15:10:30	pbriggsiam psephologist Since there is no amount of evidence that will convince you otherwise, don't tweet at me.
jbouie	722441865434271744	2016-04-19T15:08:57	Eh, not really. Nomination process is a deliberation and caucuses offer a needed and useful perspective. 
jbouie	722441275870289920	2016-04-19T15:06:37	pblest I...don't think so.
jbouie	722441057892339712	2016-04-19T15:05:45	Thesixler I disagree.
jbouie	722440780883714048	2016-04-19T15:04:39	theotaylorr They are not letting independents vote in the Democratic Party primary, no.
jbouie	722440208285708289	2016-04-19T15:02:22	jbouie Whatever is good for my candidate is fair and democratic. But, if it's bad for my candidate, it's voter suppression. Simple!
jbouie	722440475660058628	2016-04-19T15:03:26	I have said this before but I don't think the primary process should be purely majoritarian. Caucuses are good! 
jbouie	722440232226848768	2016-04-19T15:02:28	If a closed primary win is less legitimate than an open primary win, then so is a caucus for the same reasons, by an order of magnitude.
jbouie	722439920711655425	2016-04-19T15:01:14	And, if closed primaries *are* "voter suppression," then are so are caucuses.
jbouie	722438739750887424	2016-04-19T14:56:32	Two things are true.   New York should make it easier to vote.   Closed party primaries are not "voter suppression."
jbouie	722437401046593536	2016-04-19T14:51:13	Whatever your opinion of closed vs open primaries, NY needs reforms like early voting &amp; same-day voter registration 
jbouie	722437901854842880	2016-04-19T14:53:12	Totally false. Confederate soldiers purged people even *suspected* of being mixed. 
jbouie	722436104662753285	2016-04-19T14:46:04	Process arguments are almost always about narrow political advantage. 
jbouie	722406444616839168	2016-04-19T12:48:12	jbouie MattBruenig imagine if sanders has been advantaged by holding the first two contests in small, white, rural states
jbouie	722405555143368704	2016-04-19T12:44:40	Great piece. Counterarguments all = "process would be fairer if black voters in the South were forced to go last." 
jbouie	722400987671998464	2016-04-19T12:26:31	MattBruenig fivefifths But then, an alternative ordering also distorts! "Distorting is OK for my guy" is not a sound argument.
jbouie	722400351165554688	2016-04-19T12:23:59	MattBruenig jbouie you have to sequence absurdly to turn a 40/60 vote deficit into a massive delegate lead
jbouie	722400584268009472	2016-04-19T12:24:55	MattBruenig That's not the case at all. Your counter factual depends on identical behavior facing a different calendar.
jbouie	722400041638473728	2016-04-19T12:22:46	jbouie MattBruenig have you seen this that randomizes the states? Clinton leads after Super Tuesday 90% of time 
jbouie	722400200858316800	2016-04-19T12:23:24	MattBruenig And those states are far from uniformly advantageous to Clinton.
jbouie	722400103172935680	2016-04-19T12:23:00	MattBruenig But that's...not a good definition. Better might be "states demographically favorable to Clinton."
jbouie	722399979948519424	2016-04-19T12:22:31	MattBruenig Your definition of "front loaded states" seems to be "states Sanders didn't win."
jbouie	722399606932250624	2016-04-19T12:21:02	MattBruenig Neither Oklahoma nor Texas nor Virginia fit the profiles of "Deep South." And BS competed in each, vigorously.
jbouie	722399468339900417	2016-04-19T12:20:29	MattBruenig But state sequence wasn't actually front loaded for opponent. IA, NH, NV, SC followed by this: 
jbouie	722398718314418176	2016-04-19T12:17:30	ICUDrEd MattBruenig yep
jbouie	722398674119032832	2016-04-19T12:17:20	VerbDC autofocus! It's a tiny little point and shoot with a good meter that I pop slide film in
jbouie	722398163827449856	2016-04-19T12:15:18	MattBruenig Sure. But then there's no particular basis for Sanders' argument.
jbouie	722398014728314880	2016-04-19T12:14:42	VerbDC Nah, I send it off to a lab
jbouie	722397805856206848	2016-04-19T12:13:53	MattBruenig Still not sure what this is supposed to prove. It's also true Team Sanders made a strategic decision not to compete in South.
jbouie	722397401512738818	2016-04-19T12:12:16	MattBruenig I don't know what this is supposed to demonstrate.
jbouie	722396860841758722	2016-04-19T12:10:07	MattBruenig And, it's worth noting, the first two states were Iowa and New Hampshire.
jbouie	722396774850166788	2016-04-19T12:09:47	MattBruenig But then, that's a "distortion" too.
jbouie	722395179659821057	2016-04-19T12:03:26	One thing I want to emphasize is that for black Southern voters, the Dem primary is one of the few times their vote really matters.
jbouie	722395010449039360	2016-04-19T12:02:46	I wrote about what's wrong with the argument that the South "distorted" the Dem primary.

jbouie	722265075101380608	2016-04-19T03:26:27	The real lesson of this tweet thread, of course, is that I love Duran Duran.
jbouie	722264884348628992	2016-04-19T03:25:42	And "Goodbye Lovers and Friends" might as well be a hidden track on "The Wedding Album."
jbouie	722264483436093441	2016-04-19T03:24:06	But if that first record was an homage to Gang of Four, then by the time we get to "No You Girls" we are deep into "Rio" territory.

jbouie	722122561811832832	2016-04-18T18:00:09	Yes! But abolitionists are part of the reason emancipation was seriously considered and adopted.  
jbouie	722122188711534593	2016-04-18T17:58:40	jbouie PaulHRosenberg I mean abolition was also a story of revolutionaries at the grassroots too
jbouie	722121469099163649	2016-04-18T17:55:49	What's funny is story of abolition is of hard, painstaking work over a century that sowed ground for emancipation.

jbouie	722116050574295040	2016-04-18T17:34:17	ryanlcooper Oh, it is weaker, definitely. A modest majority versus a super majority.
jbouie	722115943598530560	2016-04-18T17:33:51	BlobertP ryanlcooper as always, polling averages are your best guide. those show a large NY lead and modest national advantage.
jbouie	722114947895975936	2016-04-18T17:29:54	ryanlcooper Clinton’s totals in every state with a substantial Hispanic population imply something like majority support.
jbouie	722114798637420545	2016-04-18T17:29:18	ryanlcooper I suppose at this stage I am relying less on national polls and more on voting behavior.
jbouie	722113910011088897	2016-04-18T17:25:47	jbouie It sort of seems to me that everyone, everywhere describes people who they politically disagree with as uninformed/unsophisticated.
jbouie	722113132529778688	2016-04-18T17:22:41	Amazing to see people still insist that POC Democrats (who vote for Clinton) are just unsophisticated and uninformed 
jbouie	722112576813838338	2016-04-18T17:20:29	ryanlcooper In Texas and Florida she won 71 percent and 68 percent respectively.
jbouie	722111481219833857	2016-04-18T17:16:07	I will continue to say that these arguments really need to grapple with HRC’s backing among the bulk of the Dem-voting working-class.
jbouie	722111230706626560	2016-04-18T17:15:08	“Most reliable” doesn’t equal largest, which is the implication of that line. HRC’s largest base of support are black and Latino Democrats.
jbouie	722110993728421888	2016-04-18T17:14:11	zachdcarter oh! haha, yes yes
jbouie	722110913332035584	2016-04-18T17:13:52	My other major disagreement? This, which is misleading. 
jbouie	722110210287001600	2016-04-18T17:11:04	zachdcarter They vary very much by belief and temperament, but they all tapped into the same segment of the Democratic Party.
jbouie	722110102124249089	2016-04-18T17:10:39	zachdcarter I didn’t argue that! I argued they occupied the space of the liberal insurgent.
jbouie	722108095950954499	2016-04-18T17:02:40	LBJ &amp; FDR were masters of coalition politics on a level unsurpassed by anyone other than Lincoln. That matters as much as their liberalism.
jbouie	722107378397814785	2016-04-18T16:59:49	SusannahKnox4 definitely possible.
jbouie	722107235090960384	2016-04-18T16:59:15	One major disagreement I have with that piece: Elevates ideology of LBJ and FDR when ability to play politics at high level more important.
jbouie	722106392962822144	2016-04-18T16:55:54	BrianRWasik Their liberalism less important than their capacity for strategic thinking.
jbouie	722106307654893568	2016-04-18T16:55:34	BrianRWasik Righf, I think that is correct. Ability to assess advantage and grasp moments where broad victory is possible
jbouie	722101878687940608	2016-04-18T16:37:58	jbouie This piece, to me, was by far the best lefty case for Obama in 2008 when it was clear Bush collapse was a historic opportunity

jbouie	722099862666395648	2016-04-18T16:29:57	I do think it’s odd to define Obama as a not-technocratic liberal in order to make an argument against a candidate offering Obamaism.

jbouie	722099059490734081	2016-04-18T16:26:46	This has been in the works for a bit but it acts as an able and persuasive rejoinder to my piece on Sanders.

jbouie	719729659865362432	2016-04-12T03:31:37	The simple fact of fighting in the slave South radicalized them, with consequences that were felt all the way back in Washington.
jbouie	719729501584957440	2016-04-12T03:30:59	And on the other end, white Union soldiers who joined just to beat the South encountered human misery on an unimaginable scale.
jbouie	719729331774320640	2016-04-12T03:30:19	Blacks began to free themselves by taking advantage of Union proximity, forcing Union officers to make a choice: Send them back or not.
jbouie	719729171778387969	2016-04-12T03:29:41	FWIW, it is pretty easy to see how a war to save the Union became a war of liberation.
jbouie	719727426792787968	2016-04-12T03:22:45	Except, when that one word encapsulates the central political conflict of the US from 1814 to 1860, it isn't. 
jbouie	719725250846527488	2016-04-12T03:14:06	As a matter of fact...  
jbouie	719724723060502528	2016-04-12T03:12:00	And critical to note that this is driven by the actions of blacks, slave and free. Blacks forced the issue for North 
jbouie	719724061799161857	2016-04-12T03:09:22	That made "saving the Union" into a revolutionary act though. 
jbouie	719724345216606208	2016-04-12T03:10:30	Slavery, in terms of social significance, was like homeownership. Men with means owned them, men with hopes wanted 
jbouie	719724150173089794	2016-04-12T03:09:43	I see this a lot and it is a mistake that stems from deemphasizing the place of slavery in Southern society 
jbouie	719723759104618496	2016-04-12T03:08:10	This is what Lincoln means when he says "a new birth of freedom." Civil War is crucible through which Americans purge last vestiges of old.
jbouie	719723559296348160	2016-04-12T03:07:23	Right. In a sense, the meaning of what it meant to "save the Union" expanded to include abolition.  
jbouie	719723252508192769	2016-04-12T03:06:09	Well, it has already been resolved, I am just relaying the information. 
jbouie	719722646770823168	2016-04-12T03:03:45	jbouie "These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war." -Lincoln
jbouie	719722925948026880	2016-04-12T03:04:52	Specifically, the fact that blacks began to free themselves in the wake of Union movements transformed war. 
jbouie	719722760923127808	2016-04-12T03:04:12	And assuming that Union war goals are static. The course of the war transformed war goals.  
jbouie	719722490726084609	2016-04-12T03:03:08	mtsw That really is only true until 1863.
jbouie	719722293166018561	2016-04-12T03:02:21	But by 1862 it is clear that Lincoln has been convinced that this is ultimately a war of abolition.  
jbouie	719722159799709696	2016-04-12T03:01:49	Slavery is the basic political conflict driving all sides, Lincoln's particular decision to go to war is for Union.  
jbouie	719721528372367360	2016-04-12T02:59:18	Slavery is literally the only thing in American society that would have inspired people to murder each other by the hundreds of thousands.
jbouie	719721310100828160	2016-04-12T02:58:26	And honestly, do people believe we would have fought a bloody, brutal war over...tariffs? "States' rights?"
jbouie	719720756716957698	2016-04-12T02:56:14	jbouie Straightforward, but I don't think ppl in this countrywere taught how slavery infected everything nationwide.
jbouie	719720533785518082	2016-04-12T02:55:21	People want it to be more complex, but it really is that straightforward.
jbouie	719720151642415104	2016-04-12T02:53:50	The degree to which a lot of people still want to make the Civil War about anything other than just slavery is astounding.

jbouie	719257274431119360	2016-04-10T20:14:32	jbouie The case of the South as monolithic is overstated. Clinton won AR, LA &amp; TN. Obama won NC &amp; VA. Things change over time, even there.

jbouie	718912401823907840	2016-04-09T21:24:07	Another thought: The death of Wayne's parents is handled so much more tastefully than Snyder's weird indulgence.

jbouie	718792893431996418	2016-04-09T13:29:14	tanehisicoates And it is also true that states act as drivers for how federal government reacts as much as the reverse
jbouie	718792785781006336	2016-04-09T13:28:49	tanehisicoates That makes sense. But signaling only works if there are efforts on the ground to drive changes where it has an impact

jbouie	718789839232114692	2016-04-09T13:17:06	tanehisicoates leoncrawl I think it might be more accurate to say that the crime bill was lubricant for the trend, but not a driver.

jbouie	718789065588543488	2016-04-09T13:14:02	We can both criticize WJC for the crime bill as a symbolic action that made draconian policies fully mainstream AND acknowledge that...

jbouie	718159452193611776	2016-04-07T19:32:10	ChuckLane1 I mean internally divided.
jbouie	718159062299504640	2016-04-07T19:30:37	Black communities and elites at the time were divided about what to do on crime, and I think that's been lost in our look back.
jbouie	718158953641852932	2016-04-07T19:30:11	And, as always, I think the present convo over 1990s crime laws would be improved by taking seriously the views of black voters at the time.
jbouie	718158226596859904	2016-04-07T19:27:18	Anyway, not a defense or criticism of WJC here, just a quick look at what this moment says about the direction of the politics of crime.
jbouie	718157803966304256	2016-04-07T19:25:37	As that has become clear, the politics around this have changed. But WJC, for all his political and emotional intelligence, can't see it.
jbouie	718157626966614017	2016-04-07T19:24:55	The problem, of course, is that racial bias is deeply embedded in the criminal justice system, so expansion made some things *worse*.
jbouie	718157416341188609	2016-04-07T19:24:05	"Your communities deserve to have the same police protection as white ones do" was part of his pitch for the crime bill.
jbouie	718157220366561280	2016-04-07T19:23:18	When WJC sold the crime bill in the 1990s, he used language just like this with black audiences, and many backed him!
jbouie	718157077781291009	2016-04-07T19:22:44	This really illustrates just how profoundly the politics of crime have changed since Clinton was in the White House.

jbouie	718057334287695872	2016-04-07T12:46:24	dan_munz The larger point is that political change isn’t primarily about ideology.
jbouie	718057055077031936	2016-04-07T12:45:17	dan_munz Conservatives won because they out organized the left, and in winning, they made themselves mainstream.

jbouie	717760948874977280	2016-04-06T17:08:40	tressiemcphd It's a simple case of "meet voters where they are not where you want them to be"
jbouie	717760413908275200	2016-04-06T17:06:32	almost like calendar and demographics determine "momentum" or something I dunno 
jbouie	717759234910367744	2016-04-06T17:01:51	hurray for sophistry 
jbouie	717758472163471365	2016-04-06T16:58:49	nberlat I think this gets to the key observation that "momentum" means everything and nothing.
jbouie	717758017186336768	2016-04-06T16:57:01	nberlat Candidates have to be *credible* after all, but that's not the same as "momentum."
jbouie	717757940115972096	2016-04-06T16:56:42	nberlat But is that "momentum"—since it didn't lead to a subsequent victory—or just meeting a viability threshold?
jbouie	717757628479315968	2016-04-06T16:55:28	HeerJeet Who is asserting that?
jbouie	717757430550151168	2016-04-06T16:54:41	nberlat But notably those wins did not beget wins in places where Obama wasn't favored.
jbouie	717757368235200513	2016-04-06T16:54:26	nberlat The Obama campaign took advantage of the fundamentals of contests on the calendar to build a delegate lead in most favorable places
jbouie	717757263838973952	2016-04-06T16:54:01	nberlat That is not what happened in the Obama campaign.
jbouie	717757081281900544	2016-04-06T16:53:18	HeerJeet This year, it's not that a left economic program didn't make headway with black voters, it's that *Sanders* the person didn't.
jbouie	717756986553569285	2016-04-06T16:52:55	HeerJeet I mean, sure. But has that ever really been in doubt?
jbouie	717756632109699072	2016-04-06T16:51:31	HeerJeet A Sanders-type with long-standing ties to the black church might in some sense be a more conventional politician.
jbouie	717756524471300096	2016-04-06T16:51:05	HeerJeet But that's the rub: If Sanders were that kind of candidate, would he even be Sanders?
jbouie	717756077190807554	2016-04-06T16:49:18	jbouie while we’re on momentum grievances, if people mean the tendency for things to continue at current speed, that’s closer to “inertia”
jbouie	717755679667306496	2016-04-06T16:47:43	ptrchn1 Again I think the problem here is that "momentum" is defined as whatever people want it to mean in that moment
jbouie	717754893461663746	2016-04-06T16:44:36	jbouie coreybowers and to what extent the phenomenon does exist it likely is because people believe it exists.
jbouie	717754259224158208	2016-04-06T16:42:05	jbouie just more confusion - BS may have picked up in polling as more ppl learned about him, but still not momentum, win not beget win

jbouie	717753380110598144	2016-04-06T16:38:35	that's fair. "momentum" seems to mean whatever people want it to mean. 
jbouie	717753094667386885	2016-04-06T16:37:27	jbouie I call it electoral pareidolia - imposing a pattern on random or unconnected events. Like seeing faces in clouds.
jbouie	717753083552370688	2016-04-06T16:37:24	I'm still waiting for your example of where momentum changed structure of a race. 
jbouie	717752244825944065	2016-04-06T16:34:05	jbouie Could argue that wins can establish credibility which could lead to further wins but you could argue same about debate presence.
jbouie	717752242531659776	2016-04-06T16:34:04	jbouie momentum is just something we read into clusters of success. Has no predictive power
jbouie	717752748796743680	2016-04-06T16:36:05	theshrillest they may invest in one state more than another and you may have some variation in individual state outcomes.
jbouie	717752639514128385	2016-04-06T16:35:39	theshrillest no, since if we're shuffling the calendar campaigns might make different strategic decisions.
jbouie	717752283375792130	2016-04-06T16:34:14	xpostfactoid1 or maybe that's just viability?
jbouie	717752240937820162	2016-04-06T16:34:04	xpostfactoid1 that's a fair point. I think the most you can say is something like momentum exists in the very early stages
jbouie	717751370380484608	2016-04-06T16:30:36	Follow jbouie line of thought here. IMO Momentum is only "real" when you look back and try to make sense of a race 
jbouie	717751858391961601	2016-04-06T16:32:32	theshrillest Yes, I think the final outcome—who ultimately won, who ultimately lost—would be unchanged.
jbouie	717751675897778176	2016-04-06T16:31:49	Show me an election where "momentum" overcame fundamentals of a given contest to deliver a victory? 
jbouie	717751540207890432	2016-04-06T16:31:17	Uh, no? This is how it's used in political conversation. 
jbouie	717751392136343553	2016-04-06T16:30:41	No doubt that winning tied to increased fundraising and support, but those are subordinate to fundamentals. 
jbouie	717750893525995520	2016-04-06T16:28:42	Agree w jbouie: Geography, demographics. and type of contest matter more than momentum.  Was true in '08, too.  
jbouie	717750590537908228	2016-04-06T16:27:30	I am saying there is no such thing as political momentum period, for any candidate. 
jbouie	717750406777028608	2016-04-06T16:26:46	RoostVineyard bromiust I never said it was related to physics.
jbouie	717750342654496768	2016-04-06T16:26:31	Again, if winning produced more winning, then why were HRC's March 15 wins followed by major losses a week later?
jbouie	717750080942551040	2016-04-06T16:25:29	But it doesn't at all. Wins are a function of fundamentals, from demographics to campaign organization.
jbouie	717749966668742657	2016-04-06T16:25:01	Or that winning a sequential number of primaries implies future wins. bromiust
jbouie	717749847009300480	2016-04-06T16:24:33	That isn't "momentum" though. Momentum is the idea that winning *begets* winning. 
jbouie	717748506442735617	2016-04-06T16:19:13	bromiust That was me essentially saying that it isn't real.
jbouie	717747908934807552	2016-04-06T16:16:51	jbouie the problem for her in 2008 (and Bernie now) wasn't failing to win states, but failing to lose states by a narrow enough margin.
jbouie	717748018250907652	2016-04-06T16:17:17	Exactly, vital to understand that *sequential* events aren't necessarily *linked* events. 
jbouie	717747908259528705	2016-04-06T16:16:51	Ah yes, that thing when you're a shill for *not* cheerleading for a candidate. 
jbouie	717747216362942464	2016-04-06T16:14:06	Late in the 2008 race HRC won 6 of 10 primaries. Did she have momentum? 
jbouie	717746814011764736	2016-04-06T16:12:30	Heh, this is good! "Momentum" really doesn't exist. 
jbouie	717746704921939968	2016-04-06T16:12:04	jbouie what about Joementum 
jbouie	717746511673593857	2016-04-06T16:11:18	Obama went through a long losing streak in 2008 as well. 
jbouie	717746221037850628	2016-04-06T16:10:08	jbouie Also, go ask GHWB about his "Big Mo" in 1980
jbouie	717746295205552128	2016-04-06T16:10:26	Hell, if momentum were real, how come this year's Democratic race didn't end after March 15, when HRC ran the table?

jbouie	717201159090540544	2016-04-05T04:04:15	ramsincanon But I don't have an issue with Sanders' broad moral vision.

jbouie	717199946974363650	2016-04-05T03:59:26	Yeah, a critique of Sanders ≠ an endorsement of HRC. 
jbouie	717198812587155456	2016-04-05T03:54:56	jbouie Starting a movement is one thing. Building it into an organization that lasts and enacts change is something else entirely.

jbouie	717198335338262536	2016-04-05T03:53:02	lol no it isn't. it's an argument that you have to know the system to utilize it and beat it. 
jbouie	717198142089904130	2016-04-05T03:52:16	I do, and I think that is vital and necessary. But I do not believe it is sufficient. 
jbouie	717197730607669248	2016-04-05T03:50:38	Yep, that's it. That's me, the tepid neoliberal. 
jbouie	717197097406238721	2016-04-05T03:48:07	And yes, that leads me to be skeptical of claims that the system can be overcome through "tough deals" or "revolution."
jbouie	717196757977927680	2016-04-05T03:46:46	My approach to politics can be summed up as "Pluralism is real, opposition is real, and you have to deal with the system as it exists."
jbouie	717196550246699009	2016-04-05T03:45:57	Yep, that's it. I just hate Bernie Sanders so much. 
jbouie	717196102982889473	2016-04-05T03:44:10	emmettrensin Because that's what being in a coalition means sometimes.
jbouie	717195685574131714	2016-04-05T03:42:30	emmettrensin Again, I'm not sure how Sanders is supposed to get his agenda through if he is not going to work to elect Democrats.
jbouie	717195481105956864	2016-04-05T03:41:42	PabloDeTejas_ I don't think she can, but it is also worth noting she isn't promising extraordinary changes on the basis of revolution.

jbouie	717191877645242368	2016-04-05T03:27:23	mind_is_moving You should read the rest of the thread which isn't actually about higher ed.
jbouie	717191515433472000	2016-04-05T03:25:56	Because Sanders is the only one who replies "political revolution." 
jbouie	717190820177256448	2016-04-05T03:23:10	davidgross_man Clinton's answer to "how will you accomplish this" isn't "political revolution."
jbouie	717190329275965440	2016-04-05T03:21:13	jjsattorney You should read the actual conversation, which isn't about higher ed.
jbouie	717190232546942981	2016-04-05T03:20:50	And Bernie Sanders refuses to answer the question of "what do you do next?" If you back him, doesn't this concern in the least?
jbouie	717190131816464384	2016-04-05T03:20:26	Maybe it *should* be enough. But in American government as it exists, it isn't. So what do you do next?
jbouie	717190038564511745	2016-04-05T03:20:04	And that they are things *privileged* in the American system. So it actually isn't enough to say you'll have "the people" behind you.
jbouie	717189953558548480	2016-04-05T03:19:44	I am not saying that "Sanders has bad ideas." I am saying, political opposition is a thing. Entrenched interests are a thing.
jbouie	717189113825402884	2016-04-05T03:16:24	ramsincanon Sanders is positing something that has actually never happened, so I think some skepticism is warranted.
jbouie	717189036268470272	2016-04-05T03:16:05	ramsincanon But it isn't true of every POTUS candidate. Ted Cruz has an easy answer "I will have a Republican Congress that backs me."

jbouie	717187847267160064	2016-04-05T03:11:22	If you want Sanders to accomplish anything maybe he should be pressured for details beyond "political revolution." 
jbouie	717187433138364416	2016-04-05T03:09:43	RowanKaiser I don't think it's holding him to a "higher standard" to say "a political revolution" isn't answering the question
jbouie	717187184349065216	2016-04-05T03:08:44	There is so much wrong with this. 
jbouie	717187021643640833	2016-04-05T03:08:05	The price of not dealing with them is seeing good ideas—single-payer health insurance, free college—go down in flames.
jbouie	717186947530285057	2016-04-05T03:07:47	They don't become irrelevant because you have "the people"—a vague, unhelpful concept—on your side. You have to actually deal with them.

jbouie	717186603005972480	2016-04-05T03:06:25	There is a non-trivial chance that Sanders becomes president. We are at the stage where we should take his rhetoric seriously.

jbouie	717185373806465025	2016-04-05T03:01:32	mcyost This is a conversation about pluralism using free college as an example. Not a conversation about free college.

jbouie	717184808468750340	2016-04-05T02:59:17	I see no evidence that Sanders has really reckoned with what happens when millions of well-meaning Americans push their reps to oppose him.
jbouie	717184639505416192	2016-04-05T02:58:37	What people say in an opinion poll says little about how folks will actually react to massive changes in the status quo.

jbouie	717183975127691264	2016-04-05T02:55:58	Yes, this too. How does Sanders handle the predictable and *reasonable* opposition to his agenda? 
jbouie	717183725960704000	2016-04-05T02:54:59	Is every stakeholder in the status quo a tool of "special interests?"

jbouie	717036071364780032	2016-04-04T17:08:15	HeerJeet The only way that could possibly work is through an American nationalism that isn't tied to a defense of white supremacy.
jbouie	717035604912041985	2016-04-04T17:06:24	HeerJeet The more sophisticated argument is: "What you perceive/believe to be black interests ≠ black interests"

jbouie	715938047112650758	2016-04-01T16:25:06	Love the formulation that democracy is an act, not a passive state. 
jbouie	715937645134741505	2016-04-01T16:23:30	Anyway, I just think that people contain multitudes and part of doing democracy means taking that seriously and working from there.
jbouie	715937179265052672	2016-04-01T16:21:39	So ? isn't "How do we get folks to vote for their interests?" It's, "how do we make our politics feel commiserate with their sense of self?"
jbouie	715937017473970176	2016-04-01T16:21:01	Honestly, most folks don't have mechanistic sense of "interests." They vote communities &amp; values &amp; self-conception. 
jbouie	715936770383331328	2016-04-01T16:20:02	Sure! But this just raises an additional question: If it is wrong, why are people still attracted to it? 
jbouie	715936618952200192	2016-04-01T16:19:26	This rhetoric doesn't persuade or convert or anything. It just insults.

jbouie	715936099265282048	2016-04-01T16:17:22	This is extremely difficult! (Again, it's why the decline of unionism is a terrible problem for liberals and lefties)
jbouie	715935869069340672	2016-04-01T16:16:27	You won't agree on religiosity but maybe you can show how Ryan-style politics makes it harder to sustain families and communities.
jbouie	715935601279832064	2016-04-01T16:15:23	Either way, declaring they've voted against their interests is unhelpful. You want to make their other interests more salient to them.
jbouie	715935329522425857	2016-04-01T16:14:18	Maybe that person is voting against their "interests." Maybe they've simply ranked them differently.
jbouie	715935012621778944	2016-04-01T16:13:03	Maybe a GOP voter doesn't agree with the Ryan budget, but they believe conservative religiosity should be more central in civic life.
jbouie	715934759235362817	2016-04-01T16:12:02	1 thing folks must get is that  individuals and communities have a variety of interests, of which economics is one. 
jbouie	715934553127391233	2016-04-01T16:11:13	jbouie Exactly so. This blame-the-media shtick on Trump wears thin. He is delivering a message that a certain plurality very much believes.
jbouie	715934290404630528	2016-04-01T16:10:10	RyanFredM What's difficult about it?
jbouie	715933907217203200	2016-04-01T16:08:39	And they were a space for people to organize around a common interest—labor—to pursue things common to each other's "good."
jbouie	715933665264578560	2016-04-01T16:07:41	1 reason unions were so valuable is they were a civic space where people of very different backgrounds could interact and see commonalities.
jbouie	715933426482823168	2016-04-01T16:06:44	As a general point, IMO it is possible to both take seriously others' views and acknowledge shaping effect of elites 
jbouie	715933405309960192	2016-04-01T16:06:39	Which doesn't mean you don't try change, but it does mean you have to meet people where they are and work hard to move them your way.

jbouie	715534612454383618	2016-03-31T13:42:00	jdvdub austinjmichaels Sure, but why shouldn't elected party officials have an independent say in *their party's* nomination?
jbouie	715534393809440768	2016-03-31T13:41:08	No, this doesn't result in instant change. But over time, it can transform these institutions.
jbouie	715534263475515392	2016-03-31T13:40:37	You're much more likely to change a party's direction by becoming an indispensable part of it than by withdrawing from it entirely.
jbouie	715534214481977344	2016-03-31T13:40:25	When you win elections for the party and expand participation, you also win influence.

jbouie	715533007214485507	2016-03-31T13:35:37	And while the Democratic Party is a deeply flawed, compromised institution, it also—in the fashion of American parties—is highly porous.
jbouie	715532861663748096	2016-03-31T13:35:02	Electoral politics are not the sine qua non of making change but they are a large and important part of it.
jbouie	715532440417280000	2016-03-31T13:33:22	MattBruenig this is only true if you equate "the party" with its national arms.

jbouie	715503283725533184	2016-03-31T11:37:30	I think one of Obama’s great weaknesses is he hasn’t been the best party leader—he has neglected building up the Democratic Party.

jbouie	715499599478317056	2016-03-31T11:22:52	And so, spurning the party in fundraising will somehow make them more amenable to working with him?

jbouie	715499046312546304	2016-03-31T11:20:40	Sure! But like, a Sanders agenda will need those $25K a plate people too if it is going to make it through Congress. 
jbouie	715497784179351552	2016-03-31T11:15:39	Well, if Trump is as disastrous as he looks, and he wins the nomination, maybe not.

jbouie	715497058468302848	2016-03-31T11:12:46	Fundraising for the party builds allies. And you need allies to accomplish anything. Even a revolution.

jbouie	715231216853774337	2016-03-30T17:36:25	People can like “BvS” or whatever, but I think this is the right take. Snyder hates the idea of a hero who acts because it is right.

jbouie	715190158350487559	2016-03-30T14:53:15	MattBruenig Together in a coalition, they jockey for relative influence over priorities. But they both influence priorities.
jbouie	715189896856645632	2016-03-30T14:52:13	MattBruenig Let's bring this back to actual US politics. Neither liberal centrists nor lefties have the votes to win a national election.
jbouie	715188691002650624	2016-03-30T14:47:26	MattBruenig Unless you believe that the person at the head of the coalition has no obligations to its members.
jbouie	715188630231379968	2016-03-30T14:47:11	MattBruenig Well, no. She's a majority president representing a coalition of interests.
jbouie	715187407742754816	2016-03-30T14:42:20	MattBruenig You are going to have to walk me through that because I don't see it.
jbouie	715187157581840384	2016-03-30T14:41:20	MattBruenig as a matter of course
jbouie	715187086387716096	2016-03-30T14:41:03	MattBruenig as a single party winning the presidency with 40% of the vote.
jbouie	715187023431249920	2016-03-30T14:40:48	MattBruenig Coalition wrangling within a single party that attains 50% of the vote to win a single office is not the same thing...
jbouie	715186911124520960	2016-03-30T14:40:21	MattBruenig I'm specifying presidential elections.
jbouie	715186448249413634	2016-03-30T14:38:31	But American parties aren't factions, they are broad coalitions that contain factions. 
jbouie	715186310491848704	2016-03-30T14:37:58	I'm also not sure the purpose of democracy is for every preference to have a voice. 
jbouie	715185759255470080	2016-03-30T14:35:47	And in a presidential system without ranked-choice voting, it would lead to modest pluralities taking national power.
jbouie	715185621275451393	2016-03-30T14:35:14	All this would effectively do is move locus of coalition building from within two parties to outside them. 
jbouie	715182811234308096	2016-03-30T14:24:04	tanehisicoates jbouie ...and coalition politics is *painful*.  Fantasy politics avoids that. 
jbouie	715182150241353728	2016-03-30T14:21:26	RamblinDash I said it would be okay for the GOP to take nomination from Trump if he didn't reach the delegate threshold.
jbouie	715182037397798913	2016-03-30T14:20:59	Jeff is being kind. It's worse than that. 
jbouie	715181567740624897	2016-03-30T14:19:07	RamblinDash i don't know why you think i'm arguing against primaries
jbouie	715180443516149760	2016-03-30T14:14:39	I think the difference I have is that the existing parties are themselves coalitions. 
jbouie	715176106408747008	2016-03-30T13:57:25	jbouie Two parties or two hundred, coalitions gonna coalition.
jbouie	715174521452503041	2016-03-30T13:51:07	I'll be honest, I don't really understand the fixation with third parties. 
jbouie	715174009122504708	2016-03-30T13:49:05	austinjmichaels well, I don't there's any other kind of workable democratic politics other than pluralistic politics.
jbouie	715173343612289024	2016-03-30T13:46:27	austinjmichaels that's my view of how it largely is
jbouie	715173012971061248	2016-03-30T13:45:08	DrO_aorzoff tanehisicoates i would love a copy too!
jbouie	715171632420098048	2016-03-30T13:39:39	And this in particular. 
jbouie	715171233332084736	2016-03-30T13:38:03	Okay, if you want a pretty good sense of how I view American politics, this is a great start. 
jbouie	715170277991313410	2016-03-30T13:34:16	tanehisicoates exactly. you don't have to organize them and direct them.
jbouie	715170082070994944	2016-03-30T13:33:29	tanehisicoates leaves you unprepared for organized opposition if you think that your interests should prevail because it is "the people"
jbouie	715169867519889408	2016-03-30T13:32:38	tanehisicoates Broadly, I think that aversion to thinking of politics in terms of interests and groups makes action more difficult
jbouie	715169707100389376	2016-03-30T13:32:00	tanehisicoates You don't have to pretend that X isn't a special interest if you want X to have more power and influence.
jbouie	715169608832000000	2016-03-30T13:31:36	tanehisicoates And critically, that all interests are special doesn't mean that some aren't more worthy than others.
jbouie	715168859926437888	2016-03-30T13:28:38	tanehisicoates Okay, I need to read "The Process of Government" because it basically is what I think about politics.
jbouie	715167132510773248	2016-03-30T13:21:46	(and by definition, democracy in the united states constitutes mediating and working between and with those interests)
jbouie	715166919268122625	2016-03-30T13:20:55	(tl;dr: in a huge, pluralistic, liberal democracy like the United States, literally all interests are "special interests")
jbouie	715166650660691968	2016-03-30T13:19:51	I have work to do, but I have a rant in me about the term "special interests" that I should probably do sometime. 
jbouie	715166278454001664	2016-03-30T13:18:22	CoreyAtad Your tweet has nothing to do with what I just said.
jbouie	715165807584624641	2016-03-30T13:16:30	Anyway, none of this would truly solve the GOP's Trump problem because he is winning because actual Republican voters back him.
jbouie	715165577246072832	2016-03-30T13:15:35	But if you believe superdelegates are unfair, then I think you should close the primary to people who are registered with the party.
jbouie	715165009479921664	2016-03-30T13:13:20	I think as long as you're going to let non-party voters ("independents") choose in a primary, something like superdelegates makes sense.
jbouie	715164796862205952	2016-03-30T13:12:29	Maybe. The Democratic Party process hasn't faced a situation like Trump, or had to decide between a tie. 
jbouie	715164688313659392	2016-03-30T13:12:03	pegobry ElbyLebster Please don't have this conversation in my mentions.
jbouie	715164196212707328	2016-03-30T13:10:06	jbouie A party, after all, is a coalition of groups. Not an amorphous pool of voters.
jbouie	715164346796621824	2016-03-30T13:10:42	jbouie Some people have the mistaken idea that democracy=elections. It's not. It's elections plus rules, norms, institutions.
jbouie	715164088863760384	2016-03-30T13:09:40	The other part of me is "Voters believe that nominees have to have some broader democratic legitimacy." 
jbouie	715163835905228800	2016-03-30T13:08:40	Exactly, this is the key objection to this. 
jbouie	715163612667518976	2016-03-30T13:07:47	jbouie Also, the point of a *party* is to win elections, not hold them. Primaries are nice legitimizing mechanisms, but not essential.
jbouie	715163410565042176	2016-03-30T13:06:58	.jbouie Canadians don't have this weird idea that voters choose the party leader. They choose the party, and the party chooses the leader.
jbouie	715163444572528640	2016-03-30T13:07:06	That process is more democratic than its been, but in important sense there's no requirement that it needs to be fully democratic.
jbouie	715163079005368320	2016-03-30T13:05:39	The point of the primary, after all, is for the *party*—its voters, its lawmakers, its elites—to settle on a nominee.
jbouie	715162830803234816	2016-03-30T13:04:40	Part of me thinks it would be well within GOP's rights to deny nomination to Trump at convention as long as they give to runner-up.
jbouie	715160862235951104	2016-03-30T12:56:51	Somehow I missed this story on how the legions of garbage men on the internet ruined the old Esurance mascot.

jbouie	714999783841275904	2016-03-30T02:16:47	Except that we aren’t. The GOP is gripped by animal spirits, but most Americans are repulsed by Trump. 
jbouie	714993622328950784	2016-03-30T01:52:18	Trump only signed that pledge to embarrass the RNC, he was never going to abide by it
jbouie	714994238044278784	2016-03-30T01:54:44	Trump dropped his GOP pledge as soon as he extracted promises from the field to support him. Duh.
jbouie	714985943602700288	2016-03-30T01:21:47	Can't believe Trump is a weenie who sees phantom threats everywhere. This will turn off GOP voters who think Muslims want to 9/11 them.

jbouie	714888429218217988	2016-03-29T18:54:18	I don't think is quite right. 
jbouie	714888210170642432	2016-03-29T18:53:25	This! Superheroes are about inspiring people and this scene gets to the core of that. 
jbouie	714887933480865793	2016-03-29T18:52:19	Haven't seen it yet! 
jbouie	714887419812847616	2016-03-29T18:50:17	jbouie Not afraid of simplicity. Most superhero movies cram in tons of "ideas" that go nowhere, instead of just picking one and going w it.
jbouie	714887353463148548	2016-03-29T18:50:01	MaGuire, no question. 
jbouie	714887244490870784	2016-03-29T18:49:35	jbouie Raimi also injected the right amounts of humor into his first two Spidey films. However serious they got, they were always fun.
jbouie	714886996246851584	2016-03-29T18:48:36	But that within that you can have drama and tragedy and pathos, as with Molina's Doc Ock.
jbouie	714886761869127684	2016-03-29T18:47:40	It takes as a given that superheroes are *heroes* and they are supposed to be fun.
jbouie	714886692314988545	2016-03-29T18:47:24	I know a lot of folks who don't like Raimi's Spider-Man films and I think it has a lot to do with their tone—it's serious but not somber.
jbouie	714886115333971968	2016-03-29T18:45:06	mikeduncan It's so good and I think has the exact right tone for a superhero flick.
jbouie	714885766271410179	2016-03-29T18:43:43	Train scene gets to the core of Spidey's character. It's great. 
jbouie	714885578379161602	2016-03-29T18:42:58	EvanSusser Also, feel free to unfollow me. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
jbouie	714885240825757696	2016-03-29T18:41:37	It's okay to like a movie. 
jbouie	714884961925537792	2016-03-29T18:40:31	Raimi's Spider-Man 2. 
jbouie	714884897190584320	2016-03-29T18:40:16	Yep. Just because a movie is a bit silly doesn't mean it has to be a cynical cash grab. 
jbouie	714884139896451072	2016-03-29T18:37:15	As the guys at WHMPodcast like to say, "it's okay to like a movie."
jbouie	714883780079648768	2016-03-29T18:35:49	Really my favorite thing about disliking "Batman v Superman" are all the film's fanboys. 
jbouie	714882129935667200	2016-03-29T18:29:16	MaraWritesStuff hahaha, that's incredible
jbouie	714881699360808960	2016-03-29T18:27:33	thejoshl Because...this is my Twitter feed?
jbouie	714881085507813381	2016-03-29T18:25:07	But I am being 100% sincere when I say I think "Batman v. Superman" is a failure on almost every level.
jbouie	714880952149876739	2016-03-29T18:24:35	(I am a big apologist for Raimi's Spider-Man 3, for instance)
jbouie	714880867265552386	2016-03-29T18:24:15	I can agree to disagree about lots of movies, and I'm always trying to find glimmers of the good in failures.
jbouie	714880599719288833	2016-03-29T18:23:11	thejoshl I know it's dismissive and I'm sticking to it.
jbouie	714879688640962562	2016-03-29T18:19:34	Fair enough. I think "BvS" fails on those counts too. 
jbouie	714878683228585984	2016-03-29T18:15:34	"Miracleman" and "The Dark Knight Returns" use darkness to explore an idea. Snyder uses it because its *guitar lick* sweet as hell brah.
jbouie	714878386607407104	2016-03-29T18:14:23	Exactly. To say "BvS" is critique is to pretend like Snyder doesn't enjoy—and want you to enjoy—the wanton murder. 
jbouie	714877861795115011	2016-03-29T18:12:18	Relatedly, my hottake is that philosophy 101 musings on nihilism ≠ taking superheroes seriously
jbouie	714877492704722948	2016-03-29T18:10:50	You are giving Snyder entirely too much credit. 
jbouie	714875641502547968	2016-03-29T18:03:29	not a hot take! 
jbouie	714875474686701568	2016-03-29T18:02:49	the perfect superhero movie, apparently, would just be 2 hours of disjointed scenes of "heroes" wantonly murdering bad guys
jbouie	714875299503206400	2016-03-29T18:02:07	"actually, you don't need to tell stories at all. nihilistic violence is what movies are for" 
jbouie	714873948605980673	2016-03-29T17:56:45	jbouie Yes! Things happen, but there is no narrative structure to support why they are happening or why we should care.
jbouie	714873981707358209	2016-03-29T17:56:53	I disagree. Nolan's Batman trilogy work as films. The best Marvel flicks work as films. Raimi's Spider-Man as well. 
jbouie	714873427497205760	2016-03-29T17:54:41	There is almost no narrative structure for the first 90 minutes (you heard me right) of the film. 
jbouie	714873151956586496	2016-03-29T17:53:35	annaleighclark jblumgart man, this left wing political correctness is out of control
jbouie	714872743817322496	2016-03-29T17:51:58	jbouie I'll take a thousand BATMAN &amp; ROBINs over a film without any sense of humor or style.
jbouie	714872724410208256	2016-03-29T17:51:53	The problems with BvS have nothing to do with source &amp; everything to do with basic narrative &amp; structural failures. 
jbouie	714872422558789635	2016-03-29T17:50:41	Schumacher's Batman films are at least bad in an enjoyable way! 
jbouie	714871697275490304	2016-03-29T17:47:48	I'd rather watch one of the Joel Schumacher Batman films. At least they have style and a plot that moves logically.
jbouie	714871381037608960	2016-03-29T17:46:33	I honestly don't know how anyone could watch "Batman v Superman" and think it holds up as a *movie*.
jbouie	629521369269579776	2015-08-07T05:16:05	my god 
jbouie	714866655344635909	2016-03-29T17:27:46	Also, this on "Batman v Superman" fully sums up my thoughts on that turgid waste of a movie. 
jbouie	714866517058437120	2016-03-29T17:27:13	"Michael Bay thinks explosions are awesome and stories are dumb. Zack Snyder actually hates you." 
jbouie	714863144800157696	2016-03-29T17:13:49	You spoke this one into existence, AdamSerwer.

jbouie	714850904009228288	2016-03-29T16:25:11	Why Supergirl is a better Superman story than Batman v Superman:  
jbouie	714861770456870913	2016-03-29T17:08:22	I have yet to see evidence that Trump has any appeal outside of a plurality of the GOP primary electorate.

jbouie	714821247423655936	2016-03-29T14:27:20	jdvdub lazchance this is the exact analogy I always use!
jbouie	714821170667847680	2016-03-29T14:27:02	jbouie lazchance Think of our parties as governing coalitions formed before the election rather than after as in parliament system.
jbouie	714820934968979456	2016-03-29T14:26:06	Clinton in 2008: "You should be willing to debate anytime, anywhere." 
jbouie	714820244271968256	2016-03-29T14:23:21	Yes, I keep saying this, but remaining "Reagan Democrats" are either dead or Republicans. 
jbouie	714819409806827520	2016-03-29T14:20:02	flotisserie thank you!
jbouie	714819233553760256	2016-03-29T14:19:20	mosjev Check back in six months, I suppose.
jbouie	714818888924585984	2016-03-29T14:17:58	mosjev I apologize that my 140 character tweet oversimplified something.
jbouie	714818786147377152	2016-03-29T14:17:33	mosjev Again, none of this is mutually exclusive.
jbouie	714818380985942017	2016-03-29T14:15:57	Within that, there is a lot room to be an "entrepreneur." To grab opportunities and push particular interests as far as they can go.
jbouie	714817746446467076	2016-03-29T14:13:26	Individual politicians have different priorities, interests, and temperaments, but they are bounded by their coalitions.
jbouie	714817292455034880	2016-03-29T14:11:37	Anyway, the tl;dr of those tweets is that it is important to look at presidential elections in terms of coalitions as much as individuals.
jbouie	714817061344702465	2016-03-29T14:10:42	It's worth saying that coalitions respond to unreliable coalition partners by finding new partners. 
jbouie	714816718598750208	2016-03-29T14:09:21	mosjev They understood, correctly we now know, that this combination of voters was large enough to win a primary and a national election.
jbouie	714816546447749120	2016-03-29T14:08:39	mosjev It doesn't diminish Obama to say that he and his team built on a prior campaign and took in its lessons.
jbouie	714816427644088320	2016-03-29T14:08:11	mosjev This is just a fact. Obama and his advisors come out of Chicago politics. They are intimately familiar with the Jackson campaigns.
jbouie	714816285775933441	2016-03-29T14:07:37	mosjev Obama disproved that conventional wisdom by taking the embryo of the Rainbow Coalition &amp; expanding it into something broad &amp; durable
jbouie	714816159267364864	2016-03-29T14:07:07	mosjev I don't know what else to say? Conventional wisdom was that a black Democrat couldn't assemble the votes to win nomination.
jbouie	714815464694800384	2016-03-29T14:04:22	mosjev These two things aren't mutually exclusive, but OK.
jbouie	714814023611625473	2016-03-29T13:58:38	Oh, my Twitter photo is posted with a heaping dose of irony. 
jbouie	714813346441203712	2016-03-29T13:55:57	A "Sister Souljah" moment is now inconceivable.  
jbouie	714813737690140673	2016-03-29T13:57:30	mosjev You are reading a lot of intent into my tweet. I didn't say it was *easy*.
jbouie	714813567544004608	2016-03-29T13:56:49	mosjev Of course it did. But that's in part because that coalition was larger in 2008 than twenty years prior.
jbouie	714812796219875328	2016-03-29T13:53:45	mosjev And yes, the Rainbow Coalition presages Obama's coalition.
jbouie	714812732659339265	2016-03-29T13:53:30	mosjev I don't know what's ridiculous about it? I'm not comparing Jackson to Obama, I'm comparing their coalitions.
jbouie	714812145481940992	2016-03-29T13:51:10	When we're thinking about how a Sanders or Clinton presidency would look, keep in mind they are vying for leadership of Obama coalition.

jbouie	714810561498914816	2016-03-29T13:44:53	(Parenthetical: Jesse Jackson is probably most important Democrat of the late 20th century.)
jbouie	714810465172500480	2016-03-29T13:44:30	What's also interesting is that both Sanders and HRC have legit claims to representing Jackson political legacy. 
jbouie	714810127187066883	2016-03-29T13:43:09	There are no present or prospective Senate Democrats as conservative as Sam Nunn, Jim Sasser, Wendell Ford, or J. Bennett Johnston, etc.
jbouie	714809373357318144	2016-03-29T13:40:09	jbouie Dude. In any notional U.S. parliament, there would be a large 'White Ethno-nationalist' party, plus Libertarians, Greens, NRA.
jbouie	714809163080212480	2016-03-29T13:39:19	Barack Obama leads a Democratic Party that's effectively the Jesse Jackson coalition gone national.
jbouie	714809079986831360	2016-03-29T13:38:59	Bill Clinton led a Democratic Party that still held real roots in the white South, where blacks and liberals were modest partners at best.
jbouie	714808908481708032	2016-03-29T13:38:18	jbouie *way* more important. The coalition determines who the candidates *will* be, both down-ballot and up-, in future elections.
jbouie	714808815468855296	2016-03-29T13:37:56	I continue to think folks vastly understate how the Democratic coalition has changed over the last 30 years.
jbouie	714808755884531712	2016-03-29T13:37:42	overlayered No.
jbouie	714808268040839169	2016-03-29T13:35:46	It's why Republicans are panicked at the idea of Trump, who represents a fundamentally different coalition.
jbouie	714808143289708544	2016-03-29T13:35:16	The last three retweets are key. Coalitions are just as (if not more) important than the people who lead them.
jbouie	714808029322088449	2016-03-29T13:34:49	Because there are other elections that aren't for the presidency.

jbouie	714807502018363392	2016-03-29T13:32:43	jbouie This is a larger discussion but Lincoln said a lot of different stuff to a lot of people. But he's a good example of why relying 1/2
jbouie	714807686798381057	2016-03-29T13:33:27	But! Lincoln's lesser evil was still vastly superior to Douglas' straight up accommodation with evil. And they chose accordingly.
jbouie	714807499065532416	2016-03-29T13:32:42	Abolitionists thought Lincoln was a sell out, hardly better than Democrats who sought to preserve slavery.
jbouie	714807251861696513	2016-03-29T13:31:43	Eh, that's a real fast way to becoming a failed president. 
jbouie	714806957593522176	2016-03-29T13:30:33	Lincoln wanted to compensate slaveholders and relocate black people to Africa.
jbouie	714806675975376896	2016-03-29T13:29:26	To use a historical example: Abraham Lincoln was the prime instance of a "lesser evil" in the 1860 election.
jbouie	714806577073688576	2016-03-29T13:29:03	He would have to make severe compromises—even sell out, at times—in the course of his presidency.
jbouie	714806268888805377	2016-03-29T13:27:49	Even President Bernie Sanders would stand at the head of a massive military establishment with deeply entrenched interests and practices.
jbouie	714806116740374528	2016-03-29T13:27:13	People should work to make the "lesser evil" choice less evil, but it's difficult to avoid "lesser evilism" full stop.
jbouie	714804198970429440	2016-03-29T13:19:36	2. PeterBeinart nails it. Literal Reagan Democrats are now few in number and dying off. Figurative Reagan Democrats are not Democrats.
jbouie	714804729163948032	2016-03-29T13:21:42	No, this is just how two-party systems work! Like, those are the mechanics of it. 
jbouie	714804246970036224	2016-03-29T13:19:47	mattdfreund MiddleClassDem yep
jbouie	714804085808041984	2016-03-29T13:19:09	I mean, it could. I don't think it would actually change American politics all that much. 
jbouie	714803136964202496	2016-03-29T13:15:22	The fact of the matter is that not that many people participate in the grunt work of politics. Doing so gives you a lot of leverage.
jbouie	714802994974474240	2016-03-29T13:14:49	From the bottom up, both the Democratic Party and the GOP are *vulnerable* to dedicated groups and interests.
jbouie	714802579939729408	2016-03-29T13:13:10	I don't actually think we're seeing that. 
jbouie	714802514302992384	2016-03-29T13:12:54	Eh, "supplant" is a gentle word to use for "tensions over slavery destroyed the Whig party" 
jbouie	714802390403252224	2016-03-29T13:12:24	WITH THAT SAID, I will repeat my refrain that American political parties are unusually porous.
jbouie	714802270781775872	2016-03-29T13:11:56	Without ranked choice voting or multiple member districts, the logic of the system points toward two choices.
jbouie	714802100815978496	2016-03-29T13:11:15	I mean, there's a reason why the United States almost *immediately* sorted itself into two parties.
jbouie	714801789145587712	2016-03-29T13:10:01	Winner-takes-all without ranked choice voting = a system that organizes itself into two dominant choices.
jbouie	714801699697860610	2016-03-29T13:09:40	zrahul2020 
jbouie	714801598870978560	2016-03-29T13:09:16	Anyway, if you want third parties to be viable you actually need to straight up change the voting system.

jbouie	714800256647565312	2016-03-29T13:03:56	Yep, lots of archival campaign memos talk abt minority voter apathy as an election strategy. 
jbouie	714799325050744832	2016-03-29T13:00:14	That doesn't mean you shouldn't abstain! There are legitimate reasons to do so! But that's the practical consequence.
jbouie	714798708718747650	2016-03-29T12:57:47	Fundamental point, via mattyglesias, that pro-Trump racial resentment and economic anxiety are the same thing

jbouie	714798444452450305	2016-03-29T12:56:44	It's just a fact that in a two-party, winner-takes all election, an abstention is effectively a vote for opponent.

jbouie	714575611910610945	2016-03-28T22:11:16	THIS IS PRECISELY IT 
jbouie	714575396189003776	2016-03-28T22:10:25	Eh, a movie can be trash for reasons that go beyond the technical. 
jbouie	714574505264431106	2016-03-28T22:06:52	One egregious scene, where he essentially disavows the planet. 
jbouie	714574280558841857	2016-03-28T22:05:59	It was more like my lunch. I snuck a falafel wrap into the theater.

jbouie	714573912521248770	2016-03-28T22:04:31	I won’t spoil it for you, but if you saw the film, I bet you can guess.
jbouie	714573796208984065	2016-03-28T22:04:03	And as an aside, there is a scene in the film that is so antithetical to the idea of Superman that I almost through my snack at the screen.
jbouie	714573490599362560	2016-03-28T22:02:50	byharryconnolly right?
jbouie	714573233287217154	2016-03-28T22:01:49	Snyder then has the gall to end on a somber note of hope, as if the movie earned it in the least.
jbouie	714572983730307073	2016-03-28T22:00:50	And all of this is (boring) window dressing for a forgettable fight between our heroes and a CGI cave monster.
jbouie	714572795582291968	2016-03-28T22:00:05	Batman is angry! Superman is angry! They fight, the fight is resolved in the stupidest way possible.
jbouie	714572654582317056	2016-03-28T21:59:31	Then suddenly we are treated to the villain’s scheme, which is convoluted and dumb, and sets up a fight with ZERO stakes.
jbouie	714572424826761220	2016-03-28T21:58:36	The film asserts all of its premises through clunky exposition in an hour of disjointed snippets with no tissue between them.
jbouie	714571923196350464	2016-03-28T21:56:37	Right! It is bad in that studio blockbuster way. Baffling editing aside, it is competently made. Not a disaster.

jbouie	714567957490352129	2016-03-28T21:40:51	I want to have strong feelings about it, but I don’t, at all. It is completely forgettable.
jbouie	714567605923799040	2016-03-28T21:39:27	There is no story. 
jbouie	714567476466556929	2016-03-28T21:38:57	Somehow, Warner Bros. and Zack Snyder made a 150 minute movie with no stakes, story or emotional investment.
jbouie	714567200808509440	2016-03-28T21:37:51	“Batman v. Superman” is worse than trash—it’s boring. Turgid, cynical, &amp; boring. There are glimmers of something interesting, but that’s it.
jbouie	714541238297485312	2016-03-28T19:54:41	On the bright side, Batfleck is actually pretty good. Cavil is forgettable. Amy Adams is great. I kind of like Eisenberg’s Luthor?
jbouie	714541032046784512	2016-03-28T19:53:52	So far in BvS, I fee like I have watched 20 different openings to 20 different movies, with nary a coherent story between them.

jbouie	713349237283676160	2016-03-25T12:58:06	Eh, HRC is very popular with Democrats. Among Republicans, Trump isn't especially popular.
