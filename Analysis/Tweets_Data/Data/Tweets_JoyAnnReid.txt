JoyAnnReid	725405165168300034	2016-04-27T19:24:03	Huh. This online mag of the left has joined the right in hoping for an electoral Deus ex machina by indictment.  
JoyAnnReid	725403550982017026	2016-04-27T19:17:38	Yes indeed. And thank you Toure for the heads up that it was going to be on. So glad to have experienced that.  
JoyAnnReid	725403030582120448	2016-04-27T19:15:34	Your total truth of the day:  
JoyAnnReid	725396192666988548	2016-04-27T18:48:24	ShaunKing what's mystifying is how a man with that monstrosity in his past felt free to pursue even more, and more public, power.
JoyAnnReid	725396024437649409	2016-04-27T18:47:44	ShaunKing exactly. And trying to appear doddering, as if that justifies the predation when he had absolute power over children.
JoyAnnReid	725395725413179394	2016-04-27T18:46:32	This. Right. Here. 
JoyAnnReid	725395542629584896	2016-04-27T18:45:49	ShaunKing and the fact that anyone would put the relatively sympathetic treatment down to his age... Hell, he nearly died a free man. SMH.
JoyAnnReid	725394723532361729	2016-04-27T18:42:33	blp112434 probably true.
JoyAnnReid	725394600840577024	2016-04-27T18:42:04	ShaunKing can't decide whether to applaud or rage. His victims deserve better.
JoyAnnReid	725394362201419776	2016-04-27T18:41:07	.alphoj no way McCain would do it IMO. That government shut down poisoned the well for Cruz with institutionalists like McCain.
JoyAnnReid	725394106898341888	2016-04-27T18:40:06	Meanwhile, Dennis Hastert getting 15 months in prison feels somewhere between appropriate come-uppance and total judicial inadequacy.

JoyAnnReid	725387330241060866	2016-04-27T18:13:11	On a serious note, for this gambit to work, Cruz probably needed to pick a "pro-governing(ish) conservative," like a Mike Lee or Joni Ernst.

JoyAnnReid	724810730172764162	2016-04-26T04:01:59	Yes indeed. 
JoyAnnReid	724810662178906113	2016-04-26T04:01:42	I remember one Halloween my kids watched it for the first time (when they were all under 10). Priceless! 
JoyAnnReid	724810261392150528	2016-04-26T04:00:07	Haha!! Well, you know... lol 
JoyAnnReid	724810171915063296	2016-04-26T03:59:45	Classic! 
JoyAnnReid	724810112125259776	2016-04-26T03:59:31	mrpshropshire it's you who is emotionally attached to a candidate. I am entirely, utterly, emotionally indifferent to both of them.
JoyAnnReid	724809953110843392	2016-04-26T03:58:53	mrpshropshire you're projecting your emotional attachments onto me. I never said I "trust" anybody and never mentioned TPP or fracking.
JoyAnnReid	724809794771636226	2016-04-26T03:58:16	Me too. We had a show called "Teletunes" in Denver (truestory) that played lots of UK clips, +"New York Hot Tracks!" 
JoyAnnReid	724809467657859072	2016-04-26T03:56:58	Sometimes hipster wisdom is actually true. In this case, yep. 
JoyAnnReid	724809343560998916	2016-04-26T03:56:28	Oh yeah! Who could forget "Hungry like the wolf"! :)  
JoyAnnReid	724809096856264704	2016-04-26T03:55:29	So did Rod Stewart. But they were often focused on the performance, not a companion artistic statement. Beatles did. 
JoyAnnReid	724808926961778689	2016-04-26T03:54:49	I guess you can tell I'm a music video generation baby. :)
JoyAnnReid	724808820850040832	2016-04-26T03:54:23	There are a few exceptions: Sade has some great current "video records" (as does Solange Knowles, interestingly enough). But not many.
JoyAnnReid	724808468620783617	2016-04-26T03:52:59	But today, music videos often feel like an afterthought (in part because MTV got away from the genre). Few really make statements with them.
JoyAnnReid	724808258821718017	2016-04-26T03:52:09	BTW, the Beatles very, very early on sensed the potential of video/film to enhance the experience of their music. Queen did, too.
JoyAnnReid	724808079397797888	2016-04-26T03:51:27	There are a handful of musical artists who maxed video's potential: MJ, Prince, Bowie, Madonna, Janet, early Gaga... but today? All Beyonce.
JoyAnnReid	724807480438562817	2016-04-26T03:49:04	CatchGifUCan well thank you! :)
JoyAnnReid	724807394597978112	2016-04-26T03:48:43	Yes (learned from Prince too!) &amp; reflects their sense of music vid's artistic potential &gt; any current artist IMHO. 
JoyAnnReid	724804219451150336	2016-04-26T03:36:06	This is entirely true. And this in a medium (music video) that long ago lost its tradition of Big Artistry. 
JoyAnnReid	724797380634222592	2016-04-26T03:08:56	Honored to be part of this "Call and Response w/ mharrisperry: The Pain and the Power of Lemonade"  ElleMagazine
JoyAnnReid	724795760387170305	2016-04-26T03:02:29	surgesoda what? What makes you think I don't care about that?
JoyAnnReid	724790146302906369	2016-04-26T02:40:11	Sad but true. 
JoyAnnReid	724790031731331072	2016-04-26T02:39:44	the Clinton camp will surely argue they already fundamentally agree on most issues and push BS to do so too. 2/2 
JoyAnnReid	724789800583180288	2016-04-26T02:38:49	No not unfair, but probably unrealistic on some specific items like free college. 1/2 
JoyAnnReid	724788293905321984	2016-04-26T02:32:49	GilWhitesid thanks!

JoyAnnReid	724788159997947908	2016-04-26T02:32:17	Haha! Exactly! 
JoyAnnReid	724787454838984706	2016-04-26T02:29:29	Fluffmuffin94 respectfully that's kind of vague. You want her to specifically adopt his "revolution" rhetoric?
JoyAnnReid	724787241940320260	2016-04-26T02:28:39	Don't be so sure. Depends on what they think they need, i.e., shoring up white working class or white liberal vote. 
JoyAnnReid	724786857691766785	2016-04-26T02:27:07	nsw43 depends. Typically Dems would make the calculation they don't need him to deliver NJ, and AA are already strongly with Clinton.
JoyAnnReid	724786333496020993	2016-04-26T02:25:02	HughGRexion1 PCalith you really should read the pbump article. Seriously.
JoyAnnReid	724786222909014016	2016-04-26T02:24:36	HughGRexion1 PCalith um... the DNC doesn't control a single election process. Primaries are run by states; caucuses by state parties.
JoyAnnReid	724786000740913152	2016-04-26T02:23:43	Separate is a nice way of putting it. "Ran screaming in the other direction" might be more apt...  
JoyAnnReid	724785818120937472	2016-04-26T02:22:59	Fluffmuffin94 Ok I think the candidates agree on those ideas. Is there a specific thing you'd want to hear differently?
JoyAnnReid	724785622901252097	2016-04-26T02:22:13	Well if the Dems lose in November it will be a Census year combined w/ a GOP presidential re-elect. Tough sledding. 
JoyAnnReid	724785224945688576	2016-04-26T02:20:38	A combination of that, to be sure, and a cyclical drop-off in midterm voting among Dems that goes back decades. 
JoyAnnReid	724784908300857345	2016-04-26T02:19:22	No, he's not. He's just actually not. 
JoyAnnReid	724784822145654784	2016-04-26T02:19:02	UMBIGSCOTT Nanbp thanks!
JoyAnnReid	724784633901096962	2016-04-26T02:18:17	Indeed. And for a decade, as it was a Census year. 
JoyAnnReid	724784011713859584	2016-04-26T02:15:48	iamgh0st_ big fan of U. Maryland! Did a Knight Center fellowship there in 2003. If invited, I'll be there!
JoyAnnReid	724783877907185664	2016-04-26T02:15:16	Sadly, the notion of the all-powerful executive has become a civic religion. Hard to shake people from it. 
JoyAnnReid	724783589225844736	2016-04-26T02:14:08	KatDBishop indeed.
JoyAnnReid	724783434279825408	2016-04-26T02:13:31	Fluffmuffin94 what in your view would that something be? Honest inquiry. Particularly interested in what issues you prioritize.

JoyAnnReid	724778229664505858	2016-04-26T01:52:50	Some of this seems really off base. O'Malley didn't do well &amp; MD will already go Dem. Zero chance of Clinton-Sanders

JoyAnnReid	724777555203657729	2016-04-26T01:50:09	Question about keeping jobs from going overseas: Clinton says U.S. can employ millions in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing.
JoyAnnReid	724777312915472388	2016-04-26T01:49:11	Audience member at DemTownHall shouts a question about family detention for immigrants, which Hillary Clinton says she opposes.

JoyAnnReid	724773914547773440	2016-04-26T01:35:41	Has anyone figured out which collection of hedge funds and Wall Street baddies is behind those anti-Puerto Rico debt deal ads?
JoyAnnReid	724773595952599040	2016-04-26T01:34:25	Hillary Clinton to Dems: "vote against people who give in to the gun lobby all the time."

JoyAnnReid	724773004731944964	2016-04-26T01:32:04	It's early enough that it doesn't really impact much. If that's the stance in July or in the fall, different story. 
JoyAnnReid	724771890154319872	2016-04-26T01:27:38	Dakinikat now_justice for real.
JoyAnnReid	724771809313349634	2016-04-26T01:27:19	Yes. 
JoyAnnReid	724771471478939649	2016-04-26T01:25:59	Yogotobekidding FisherBurton I wrote a book that was in large part about that campaign. Based on direct interviews and research it's true.
JoyAnnReid	724770988332863490	2016-04-26T01:24:03	Would be so helped by universal registration, robust early voting days and hours and a restored VRA. 
JoyAnnReid	724770221668614144	2016-04-26T01:21:01	It's the single biggest way Democratic-leaning citizens aid and abet the policies they then bear the brunt of.

JoyAnnReid	724767927157796866	2016-04-26T01:11:54	Not quite accurate. He has been clear that she would have to make commitments on some of his issue positions.  
JoyAnnReid	724767464308019201	2016-04-26T01:10:03	expatina BeachPeanuts In his sleeping gown! Lol
JoyAnnReid	724767312797163520	2016-04-26T01:09:27	Is it me or is Hillary Clinton is about to rip her wig off and toss it on the floor? üëÄ
JoyAnnReid	724767054952280064	2016-04-26T01:08:26	Ooh, now we do have an answer: Hillary Clinton says she didn't demand conditions from Barack Obama in 2008 (implication: back off, Bernie.)
JoyAnnReid	724766672217841664	2016-04-26T01:06:54	Hillary Clinton now picks up the "I heard what you asked me, but now here are the points I came here to make" baton from Sen. Sanders.
JoyAnnReid	724766176774070272	2016-04-26T01:04:56	Yep. 
JoyAnnReid	724766119186280448	2016-04-26T01:04:42	Wouldn't that be refreshing? 
JoyAnnReid	724765500555800577	2016-04-26T01:02:15	üëÄ 
JoyAnnReid	724765103820775424	2016-04-26T01:00:40	But of course it does. No better promotion on earth.

JoyAnnReid	724763927402405888	2016-04-26T00:56:00	I also admit to bothering God too much with pleas to bless America.  
JoyAnnReid	724763575504527361	2016-04-26T00:54:36	Exactly. 
JoyAnnReid	724763473234804736	2016-04-26T00:54:12	You're going to give the legislatures of about two dozen states agita. 
JoyAnnReid	724762922472329216	2016-04-26T00:52:00	Trueness.  
JoyAnnReid	724762800573284357	2016-04-26T00:51:31	That's often the promise (ie the lottery to education funding) but it's a good bet it winds up in the general fund. 
JoyAnnReid	724762247545888768	2016-04-26T00:49:19	The hardest thing to do is to get a politcian to admit they've ever made an error. I guess they fear the quote will wind up in an ad.
JoyAnnReid	724761798562484227	2016-04-26T00:47:32	Sanders grudgingly admits to one voting error (on deregulating swaps). But he still parses his crime bill vote &amp;pivots to attacking Clinton.
JoyAnnReid	724761383020142592	2016-04-26T00:45:53	The challenge is always that those taxes are harder to pass. 
JoyAnnReid	724760955914215424	2016-04-26T00:44:11	chrislhayes I'd subscribe to that podcast. But you might need two hours.
JoyAnnReid	724760581933293568	2016-04-26T00:42:42	Indeed. 
JoyAnnReid	724760382406021121	2016-04-26T00:41:55	Still, Sanders has a point about the regressive tax part of the calculation.
JoyAnnReid	724760256455254016	2016-04-26T00:41:25	And it's easier to imagine statewide voters passing a consumption tax (tho still hard to do) than our inert congress passing a Wall St tax.
JoyAnnReid	724759728501460996	2016-04-26T00:39:19	It's an interesting Q/dilemma for liberals, who generally favor taxing harmful products (cigarettes, gasoline...) to fund progressive progs.
JoyAnnReid	724758981235867649	2016-04-26T00:36:21	But consumption taxes are regressive, no matter how you slice it. They just hit less wealthy people more. 2/2
JoyAnnReid	724758757427810304	2016-04-26T00:35:27	The arguments for the soda consumption tax make sense (hit an unhealthy product with an enactable tax to fund pre-school for all)... 1/2
JoyAnnReid	724758317764063233	2016-04-26T00:33:42	The "soda tax for preschool" issue elicits Sanders' strongest answer so far; basically, make Wall St pay for universal pre-K, not families.
JoyAnnReid	724757562369953792	2016-04-26T00:30:42	Could be, Mr. Gray. Could be... 
JoyAnnReid	724757207175315461	2016-04-26T00:29:18	Can a man really live in two bags at once? Are the bags adjacent to each other at least? 
JoyAnnReid	724756672909041664	2016-04-26T00:27:10	And I'm guessing no one reallzed it until they read it on the Twitters. Now had she turned up in the men's room... 
JoyAnnReid	724755880328224768	2016-04-26T00:24:01	talexander_au it's incredibly frustrating, this need and demand that the media universe bend toward people's desired outcome.

JoyAnnReid	723331403765657601	2016-04-22T02:03:40	Janet and Madonna are what remains of the icons for 80s kids. Aretha, Patty, Gladys and Stevie for a generation up.

JoyAnnReid	723328410655793152	2016-04-22T01:51:46	Sinead's version was haunting and iconic too, but Prince and Rosie invested it with magical soul. 
JoyAnnReid	723327722269843456	2016-04-22T01:49:02	Listening to Prince's version of "Nothing compares to you," with Rosie Gaines. Just crushing sadness. The world has been robbed.

JoyAnnReid	722964804235718656	2016-04-21T01:46:56	Just wondering.
JoyAnnReid	722964764884799488	2016-04-21T01:46:46	Will the Michigan A.G. be willing to scrutinize the administration that seized control of Flint and whose manager ordered the water switch?
JoyAnnReid	722964569878986753	2016-04-21T01:46:00	So the Republican attorney general of Michigan is throwing the proverbial book at low level functionaries over Flint. What about the bosses?
JoyAnnReid	722962367542218753	2016-04-21T01:37:15	Actually Guam is a primary:  
JoyAnnReid	722960947275505664	2016-04-21T01:31:36	Three: Virgin Islands (6/4), Puerto Rico (6/5) and North Dakota (6/7). 
JoyAnnReid	722960397049978881	2016-04-21T01:29:25	From a messaging perspectivw, IMHO the Sanders team is on firmer ground saying they want to allow people in all of the states to vote.
JoyAnnReid	722959819674669056	2016-04-21T01:27:07	The Sanders campaign seems to be embracing less and less democratic methods of gaining the nomination. Caucuses, conventions not votes?

JoyAnnReid	722660742873399298	2016-04-20T05:38:42	I've asked people in the Sanders orbit this question and they categorically rule it out.

JoyAnnReid	722652806663008256	2016-04-20T05:07:10	Not winning a demographic doesn't imply not having *any of that demographic.  
JoyAnnReid	722652662915801089	2016-04-20T05:06:35	That's true. He does much better with POC under 40. But overall he's not breaking 30% with black voters. 
JoyAnnReid	722652244198428672	2016-04-20T05:04:55	Sanders has already pulled the race and Clinton onto his territory ITO issues. Question is what next? The coming weeks will be interesting.
JoyAnnReid	722651456038379521	2016-04-20T05:01:47	The reality though, is that the two coalitions clearly are unlikely to dramatically change, and the larger one has the math on its side.
JoyAnnReid	722651095537987587	2016-04-20T05:00:22	Team Sanders now has to decide what to do next: keep their base fueled by continuing to attack Clinton, or try to grow it some other way.
JoyAnnReid	722650527348224000	2016-04-20T04:58:06	...but smaller than Clinton's coalition of solid Dems, including black voters, +40/45 YOs esp women, and moderates, esp. in big states.
JoyAnnReid	722649723551760386	2016-04-20T04:54:54	One conclusion is that Sanders' coalition of young ppl/collegians, liberal Dems/independents, and blue collar white voters is vibrant...

JoyAnnReid	722521667742867460	2016-04-19T20:26:04	SonofBaldwin the lesson here: don't assume anything, even with an indictment. D.A.s are still aligned with police departments.

JoyAnnReid	721418594735632384	2016-04-16T19:22:50	This right here.  
JoyAnnReid	721418511294312448	2016-04-16T19:22:31	PremiereBAgency exactly.
JoyAnnReid	721418360861429761	2016-04-16T19:21:55	DanaHoule hey if I was at that conference and I thought there was a chance of meeting Pontifex I'd have waited around too. Real talk.
JoyAnnReid	721418095844270080	2016-04-16T19:20:52	AriRussell I completely agree. And people only see evil in their opponent. They all pander and take advantage of opportunities. All of them
JoyAnnReid	721417754390228997	2016-04-16T19:19:30	AriRussell Audnumber Clinton wld jump at the invite too. Who wouldn't? The issue is the characterization, which the Vatican objected to.
JoyAnnReid	721417400399347714	2016-04-16T19:18:06	AriRussell the reason for the discussion is that the campaign and candidate implied it was a papal invite. Same deal if Clinton did that.
JoyAnnReid	721417111290134528	2016-04-16T19:16:57	dklaw4heat I think that's perfectly fair.
JoyAnnReid	721416980595621890	2016-04-16T19:16:26	Check the polls. One more day wouldn't be make or break.  
JoyAnnReid	721416657743298561	2016-04-16T19:15:09	Being mad about Sanders going to Rome is as silly as hating George Clooney for raising money for state and national Dems. Both are AOK.
JoyAnnReid	721415879645388802	2016-04-16T19:12:03	And to reiterate, I'm glad Senator Sanders had the opportunity. At 74 he is finding a global audience for his ideas. Why not go to Rome?
JoyAnnReid	721415467311697920	2016-04-16T19:10:25	This is actually a good, balanced read. This wasn't "stalking", not an invite. It was serendipity and persistence.

JoyAnnReid	721410319764099072	2016-04-16T18:49:58	You're now calling the pope a liar, and saying you know he secretly summoned a US presidential candidate. Mkay.

JoyAnnReid	721409872361889792	2016-04-16T18:48:11	roglyn what a ridiculous tweet. The facts are clear. You want them to fit your religious zeal and for me to worship with you. No thanks.
JoyAnnReid	721409564453814273	2016-04-16T18:46:57	Sometimes just let cool things be cool. Bernie had a hell of an opportunity and clearly stuck around to get to meet the pope. Happy 4 him.
JoyAnnReid	721409105668259840	2016-04-16T18:45:08	There were two presidents at that conference. The Vatican has made it clear why he didn't go, and that he summoned no one.
JoyAnnReid	721408892098473985	2016-04-16T18:44:17	The pope is essentially the head of a government. Why would he summon a presidential candidate? That would be interfering in an election.
JoyAnnReid	721408560698126336	2016-04-16T18:42:58	I think it's very cool that Bernie Sanders got to speak at a Vatican forum and meet Pontifex. But why try to remake it into a papal invite?

JoyAnnReid	721406504348295168	2016-04-16T18:34:48	True. 
JoyAnnReid	721406503933100032	2016-04-16T18:34:48	sydj1405 DLN7527 not worthwhile to feed the zealots, my friend. No point in spending quality time debating them about their religion.

JoyAnnReid	721404784083865600	2016-04-16T18:27:58	True but not all of them (Ms Sarandon for example). And many Sanders fans are too young to remember that.  
JoyAnnReid	721404204645003265	2016-04-16T18:25:40	Indeed. And people may have forgotten but feelings were raw in '08 too. Still, the hatred is intense...

JoyAnnReid	720817241466527744	2016-04-15T03:33:17	I don't think the demdebate will change many minds or create new converts for either candidate. It was just too nasty to sell newbies.
JoyAnnReid	720817048947924992	2016-04-15T03:32:31	Worst moments for each: Clinton - SocSec cap (she seemed to dodge the answer); Sanders: non-answers on banks break-up, healthcare funding.
JoyAnnReid	720816746068865026	2016-04-15T03:31:19	Ok my quick take on the DemDebate: Best moments for each candidate: Clinton - guns (she clearly won that xchg). Sanders - Israel-Palestine.
JoyAnnReid	720816129862680576	2016-04-15T03:28:52	aacoek :-)
JoyAnnReid	720815962660933632	2016-04-15T03:28:12	HouseOfRakes I don't know. I got bored with whatever it is they were saying and stopped reading :)
JoyAnnReid	720815788551233536	2016-04-15T03:27:30	erick70115 Clarknt67 yep. Completely serious. Including in the face of non-sequiturs.
JoyAnnReid	720815524276518913	2016-04-15T03:26:27	Perfect answer.  
JoyAnnReid	720815312531255296	2016-04-15T03:25:37	1. Yes I do get paid to give my point of view. 2. ... oh actually I just lost interest in your tweet. 
JoyAnnReid	720814277179895809	2016-04-15T03:21:30	ChrisMacDen illianomaly that's ok Chris. I've muted the right righteous Riel already.
JoyAnnReid	720813945943154689	2016-04-15T03:20:11	pk921 thanks :)
JoyAnnReid	720813729470930944	2016-04-15T03:19:19	Exactly. 
JoyAnnReid	720813544367853568	2016-04-15T03:18:35	So what if they are? Are there votes and decisions on a Dem nominee less valuable? Same could be said in Utah, Idaho 
JoyAnnReid	720813298736869376	2016-04-15T03:17:37	Pro-tip to candidates: implying there's something defective about voters who don't choose you isn't a great way to broaden your appeal.
JoyAnnReid	720812650490380288	2016-04-15T03:15:02	You become a party's nominee by winning in lots of states in lots of regions. Let's stop parsing voters that way. They all count.
JoyAnnReid	720812483599052800	2016-04-15T03:14:22	Not to mention the fact that white Democrats are all-but an endangered species in the south. Their votes matter as much as Wisconsans.
JoyAnnReid	720812327373783040	2016-04-15T03:13:45	Southern blacks in states like Mississippi literally died for the right to vote. Let's not dismiss southern votes as "conservative" piffle.
JoyAnnReid	720812067633172480	2016-04-15T03:12:43	Jesse Jackson's 1984 &amp; 1988 campaigns, not to mention the voting rights movement of the 1960s, were about registering southern black voters.
JoyAnnReid	720811733540073472	2016-04-15T03:11:23	Oceanfrontfit nope. Wrong. And goodbye.
JoyAnnReid	720811642993393666	2016-04-15T03:11:02	Welp... what did you think of that melee, tweeps? demdebate

JoyAnnReid	720810728047931392	2016-04-15T03:07:24	aweiser278 re-read that tweet. Maybe you will figure out why I'm blocking and reporting you.
JoyAnnReid	720810551648063489	2016-04-15T03:06:42	Correct. In fact, what Dems remain down south are either more liberal white voters, or voters of color. 
JoyAnnReid	720810256322928641	2016-04-15T03:05:31	Indeed. And no one is saying "oh well they're conservative states, forget them." 
JoyAnnReid	720810102245212160	2016-04-15T03:04:55	Which is precisely why voters there should have every opportunity to weigh in on the nominee and not be dismissed. 
JoyAnnReid	720809939871141888	2016-04-15T03:04:16	Ohio is a less reliable Democratic state than Florida: it has gone D four times since 1976, while Florida has gone D five times. thesouth
JoyAnnReid	720808768108412928	2016-04-15T02:59:36	The Sanders campaign would come to regret giving the back of the hand to the south if he were to be the nominee. NC, FL, VA all in play.
JoyAnnReid	720808389220155392	2016-04-15T02:58:06	Southern Dem voters have got to be wondering what they did to get dismissed so summarily. No one says these things about Utahns.
JoyAnnReid	720808120314949632	2016-04-15T02:57:02	Clinton touts her lead in pledged delegates, starts citing non-southern states where her campaign also won. demdebate

JoyAnnReid	720806723586494464	2016-04-15T02:51:29	@Magi_Eskand so you're actually instructing me what to tweet now? Why don't you just send tweet by tweet instructions to improve obedience.
JoyAnnReid	720806454924587008	2016-04-15T02:50:25	Sanders answers Q re whether he is a Dem with snark: "well why would I be running for the nomination of the Democratic Party?" demdebate

JoyAnnReid	720801271687602176	2016-04-15T02:29:49	Gotta say, that was the most interesting exchange on Israel-Palestine that I've seen in a debate in a very long time. demdebate
JoyAnnReid	720800741179449344	2016-04-15T02:27:43	Completely subjective. That's why I wrote it in my very own Twitter feed, not in a news story. 
JoyAnnReid	720800373653577728	2016-04-15T02:26:15	Sanders going after Clinton's AIPAC speech, says "I heard virtually nothing about the Palestinian people." demdebate
JoyAnnReid	720800070619295746	2016-04-15T02:25:03	The question on the Clinton deal offered to Arafat and the Palestinians is more nuanced than Sec'y Clinton explained. But there you go.

JoyAnnReid	720799197025419264	2016-04-15T02:21:35	For real.  
JoyAnnReid	720799158072918016	2016-04-15T02:21:25	Sanders' view on Israel-Palestine is, by any measure, far more humane and even-handed than most Democrats, Clinton included. demdebate

JoyAnnReid	720798686960332804	2016-04-15T02:19:33	The crowd at the demdebate tired themselves out the first hour, apparently. Much calmer now.
JoyAnnReid	720798463420678144	2016-04-15T02:18:40	Great question. And that goes for every single debate for many election cycle.  
JoyAnnReid	720798046167113728	2016-04-15T02:17:00	Expect more reverb on this.

JoyAnnReid	720796832348127232	2016-04-15T02:12:11	So politifact ruled Clinton's claim that Sanders voted for Libya regime change "mostly true" - 
JoyAnnReid	720796587459522561	2016-04-15T02:11:12	Hillary Clinton says Senate took a vote re supporting Libyan people's quest to oust regime and Sanders voted for it. Googling! demdebate

JoyAnnReid	720789645970300928	2016-04-15T01:43:37	Quite likely. 
JoyAnnReid	720789509470859267	2016-04-15T01:43:05	Sanders' pivot back to the assault weapons ban in 1994 is actually not an effective answer to the liability issue. It's a dodge. demdebate

JoyAnnReid	720787153941315585	2016-04-15T01:33:43	This right here. Particularly since the campaigns and supporters will all try to pack them to their advantage.

JoyAnnReid	720782166234411009	2016-04-15T01:13:54	Sanders is very adept at asserting the points he wants to make, rather than answering the question he's been asked. demdebate
JoyAnnReid	720782035250450432	2016-04-15T01:13:23	Sanders not waiting til the end of the question to launch hellfire missiles at Goldman Sachs. demdebate

JoyAnnReid	720775106352517120	2016-04-15T00:45:51	Ok tweeps: which issue do you think will draw the most heat at tonight's DemDebate:
JoyAnnReid	720655470248267776	2016-04-14T16:50:27	Sanders gets chants of "Bernie! Bernie!" as he leaves the podium. I think his campaign will be pleased with the response at NAN25
JoyAnnReid	720655161987895296	2016-04-14T16:49:14	Sanders in side swipe at Clinton: "if you elect me you get a president who will take on the billionaire class, not take their money." NAN25
JoyAnnReid	720654950590754816	2016-04-14T16:48:23	Sanders mentions knowing Hillary Clinton 25 years and them being friends, adds "but" we can't be a nation for the 1 percent. NAN25

JoyAnnReid	720654580988669952	2016-04-14T16:46:55	Jesse Jackson gets his second shout out from Sanders, who mentions endorsing Jackson in '88. NAN25
JoyAnnReid	720654319264145408	2016-04-14T16:45:53	Sanders going after Clinton in side swipe at "big money candidate" gets only a smattering of applause. NAN25
JoyAnnReid	720654002673840128	2016-04-14T16:44:37	Another stylistic difference: Hillary Clinton spent a lot of time talking up individuals she has worked with; Sanders sticking to his ideas.
JoyAnnReid	720653577610530816	2016-04-14T16:42:56	So it's a smaller crowd, but Sanders is getting a good response. NAN25
JoyAnnReid	720653404381556738	2016-04-14T16:42:15	One diff from yesterday is crowd size. Yesterday there was about a 400-person overflow who couldn't get in and security was crazy. NAN25
JoyAnnReid	720652488341331968	2016-04-14T16:38:36	Sanders doing basically the speech he did last night, but shorter, so won't retweet it line by line. Going over well in the room. NAN25

JoyAnnReid	720651944143036416	2016-04-14T16:36:27	Sanders on policing says police who break the law should be held accountable, slams militarization and private prisons, calls for training.
JoyAnnReid	720651218192875521	2016-04-14T16:33:34	Sanders cites high youth unemployment, says "we are gonna invest in education for our kids not prisons." NAN25

JoyAnnReid	720447339236892672	2016-04-14T03:03:25	Many of these are marginally attached or first time voters. The campaigns had a responsibilty to organize, though.

JoyAnnReid	720446303201845249	2016-04-14T02:59:18	MonteSpice highly doubt it.
JoyAnnReid	720445983071584256	2016-04-14T02:58:02	The saddest thing is some people are only now realizing it, and it's too late.

JoyAnnReid	720440665772048384	2016-04-14T02:36:54	.Lawrence is absolutely right. These presidential candidates should visit a public housing project to better understand urban poverty.
JoyAnnReid	720440273596215296	2016-04-14T02:35:21	Indeed. But the campaigns have to organize their strategies accordingly. 
JoyAnnReid	720428624554242048	2016-04-14T01:49:03	I did talk to some unregistered young Sanders supporters and a couple volunteers who are seeing small pockets of unregistered supporters.
JoyAnnReid	720428240385478657	2016-04-14T01:47:32	One big question for Sanders is what percentage of the very enthusiastic young NY supporters regjstered as Dems by the Oct deadline.

JoyAnnReid	720296802692526084	2016-04-13T17:05:14	Indeed. But I'm talking even before he was president. Perhaps the constraints of future goals but still true.

JoyAnnReid	720296064553603073	2016-04-13T17:02:18	Last point: Hillary Clinton has long been very blunt about putting things in explicitly racial terms (moreso than Obama until recently.)
JoyAnnReid	720295628459225088	2016-04-13T17:00:34	The things that don't work for her in a huge rally setting do work in these kinds of settings. NAN25

JoyAnnReid	720037218698571777	2016-04-12T23:53:45	Yep. It's 45 percent Dem, 29 percent Republican. (By compar: Bronx 78% D, Manh 70%, Bk about 73%) 
JoyAnnReid	720036825293811712	2016-04-12T23:52:11	It's a hell of an interesting season in politics.
JoyAnnReid	720036695161380865	2016-04-12T23:51:40	And their second choice is frequently Sanders, who also speaks to their economic frustration. 
JoyAnnReid	720036454580232192	2016-04-12T23:50:43	The ones I've met by and large have seen their job and financial prospects dim, and in their view the US "weaken." 
JoyAnnReid	720036219745243136	2016-04-12T23:49:47	I've talked to them. White, blue collar Dems who voted for Bill Clinton, even some Obama, and now support Trump.  
JoyAnnReid	720035692575911936	2016-04-12T23:47:41	I think it speaks to frustration with the limits of politics, and its failure, in their view to improve their lives. 
JoyAnnReid	720035328682299392	2016-04-12T23:46:14	One remarkable thing I've noticed is how many Trump Democrats still like Bill Clinton, but detest, or at least distrust, Hillary.
JoyAnnReid	720034772676960256	2016-04-12T23:44:02	Boom. And much love to club_reid and all the reiders! 
JoyAnnReid	720034619878465536	2016-04-12T23:43:25	I think that fact will, on the margins, help Sanders, who was nearly all of their second choice. 
JoyAnnReid	720034429121531904	2016-04-12T23:42:40	I will say many seem loosely connected to the political process. Many didn't realize they couldn't vote for him 4/19 
JoyAnnReid	720034208559796224	2016-04-12T23:41:47	I've met a fair number of them, especialy yesterday in Staten Island. Couldn't quantify it, though.

JoyAnnReid	718490481932562433	2016-04-08T17:27:34	Bottom line: we have to tackle mass incarceration as a society, from localities to states to the federal gov't. No POTUS can magic wand it.

JoyAnnReid	718443429701763075	2016-04-08T14:20:36	But even with all of that said, if you really want to locate the main source of mass incarceration, look at state legislators and governors.
JoyAnnReid	718443045574860800	2016-04-08T14:19:04	But even Reagan doesn't deserve all the blame. There's also the draconian Rockefeller drug laws of the early 1970s &amp; Nixon's "war on drugs"

JoyAnnReid	718246002910748672	2016-04-08T01:16:06	JayBirdman_ if you objectively think Bill Clinton was bad at being president I'm not sure what to tell you. And she is running, not him.

JoyAnnReid	718243075575955458	2016-04-08T01:04:28	That's got to be a weird place for a once popular two-term president to be, especially one as combative as BC.  
JoyAnnReid	718242869585252352	2016-04-08T01:03:39	The point is I'm sure he expected it to work in Hillary's favor everywhere, and now finds the whole era rejected. 
JoyAnnReid	718242474506993664	2016-04-08T01:02:04	JayBirdman_ having studied the history of it, DOMA was defensive by the White House, not a move made on offense. I can't read minds though.
JoyAnnReid	718240780725444610	2016-04-08T00:55:21	JayBirdman_ I was talking about the crime bill not DOMA, which btw was at the time a way to short circuit a constitutional amendment.

JoyAnnReid	718238579512721409	2016-04-08T00:46:36	More on the Bill Clinton rant here: 
JoyAnnReid	718238452072976384	2016-04-08T00:46:05	...which has been to concede that huge chunks of Clinton era policy were well meaning but wrongheaded. 2/2
JoyAnnReid	718238247470686213	2016-04-08T00:45:17	Based on how combative he was in 2008, it wouldn't surprise me if Bill Clinton is eager to defend his presidency vs the campaign's tack 1/2
JoyAnnReid	718237926677704704	2016-04-08T00:44:00	Another point: the Bill Clinton rant hints at what could be a strategic rift btwn the fmr prez &amp; the campaign on whether to defend the 90s.

JoyAnnReid	717724866951122944	2016-04-06T14:45:17	But keep in mind WI is 88 percent white, 6.6 percent black, about 5 percent Hisp, and remainder API and Native Am. 
JoyAnnReid	717724518022782978	2016-04-06T14:43:54	I think Sanders got 58 percent of the white vote and Clinton got 74 percent of the black vote in WIPrimary 
JoyAnnReid	717724106360274944	2016-04-06T14:42:16	Then Dems and POC will keep getting the status quo: advancement then retrenchment every two years. 
JoyAnnReid	717723713408540672	2016-04-06T14:40:42	It will be very difficult. Not completely impossible I guess. He needs to run the table in the big states, 60-40+. 
JoyAnnReid	717723222842732544	2016-04-06T14:38:45	brimajr AliciaNicoleBK :-)
JoyAnnReid	717723181860171780	2016-04-06T14:38:35	True. It's what you might call an "unknown unknown..."  
JoyAnnReid	717723026192801792	2016-04-06T14:37:58	Same thing happened when Obama won there by 17 points in '08. 
JoyAnnReid	717722889903071232	2016-04-06T14:37:26	It would probably be over, or close to it, since Clinton won the biggest, high delegate states: OH, FL, SC, IL, etc. 
JoyAnnReid	717722392764743683	2016-04-06T14:35:27	fakedansavage I personally did segments on it with Tony. And chrislhayes covered it on the ground as well.
JoyAnnReid	717722194390986752	2016-04-06T14:34:40	You may have missed the great reporting by tonydokoupil who actually followed people ensnared by the process. 
JoyAnnReid	717721838227431424	2016-04-06T14:33:15	AliciaNicoleBK that's the system they all signed up for. It's all about pledged delegates.

JoyAnnReid	717721377512534020	2016-04-06T14:31:25	They are electeds, yep. 
JoyAnnReid	717721174629814273	2016-04-06T14:30:37	It was a travesty. Worked exactly as intended: to harry college students, black and brown voters. 
JoyAnnReid	717720949060210688	2016-04-06T14:29:43	True indeed. 
JoyAnnReid	717720852226289664	2016-04-06T14:29:20	But he only gets a share. That means win or lose, Clinton gets delegates. So a 200 delegate lead is actually a lot. 
JoyAnnReid	717720576241057792	2016-04-06T14:28:14	For example: if Bernie could have gotten ALL the delegates from the last seven states he could close in. 2/2 
JoyAnnReid	717720291879829505	2016-04-06T14:27:06	But in delegate math 200 is a lot. It's likely prohibitive, due to proportional allocation. 1/2 
JoyAnnReid	717719956033552384	2016-04-06T14:25:46	They did exactly that in 2008. Clinton won the popular vote, Obama won the pledged delegates. They went with Obama.

JoyAnnReid	717717195309117443	2016-04-06T14:14:48	She actually is winning by a lot - by more than double Obama's '08 pledged delegate lead over her. 
JoyAnnReid	717716805926694913	2016-04-06T14:13:15	pachiche1 how is that argument, which is based on actual convos w: SDs, weak? Be specific.
JoyAnnReid	717716581892100096	2016-04-06T14:12:22	It was put in place to guard against what you're seeing on the R side: seizure of the party by an unwanted force. 
JoyAnnReid	717715346128564224	2016-04-06T14:07:27	So they are counting the SD's who have made it known who they support. Both candidates have them BTW. 
JoyAnnReid	717713587402366977	2016-04-06T14:00:28	steakhousegirl I think people are lashing out at the process in frustration. When you really want something it's hard to hear it may not be

JoyAnnReid	717713094051495936	2016-04-06T13:58:30	It's definitely a mechanism to keep people in the parties, whether they like it or not.  
JoyAnnReid	717712901860098048	2016-04-06T13:57:44	I voted in Florida for 14 years - closed primaries there and now here in NY. And here we don't even have early vote. 
JoyAnnReid	717712155253030913	2016-04-06T13:54:46	It was a decision made above my pay grade. I personally choose to tweet &amp; write about pledged delegates *plus* SDs.  
JoyAnnReid	717711485204561920	2016-04-06T13:52:07	By "acknowledge" you mean ensuring that your candidate wins? Because open primary states DO acknowledge indies. 
JoyAnnReid	717711233386983425	2016-04-06T13:51:07	Those things will take considerable time, patience &amp; Dem voters actually participating in midterms &amp; local elections 
JoyAnnReid	717710677499052032	2016-04-06T13:48:54	Thanks, though I'm starting to wonder if people are intersted in reason anymore... (Sigh) 
JoyAnnReid	717710386011750400	2016-04-06T13:47:45	What are you even talking about? Have you been reading the thread or is this just your id typing?  
JoyAnnReid	717709932464893954	2016-04-06T13:45:56	If Sanders somehow overtakes Clinton in pledged delegates, he'll get the vast maj of supers. That's how it works. 
JoyAnnReid	717709682626924544	2016-04-06T13:44:57	I think it already has! Considerably, particularly at the grassroots level. Party elites have no choice but to folo. 
JoyAnnReid	717709382272872452	2016-04-06T13:43:45	And by the way, they don't even count until the convention, when they will vote en masse for whoever is ahead in pledged delegates.
JoyAnnReid	717709153066688512	2016-04-06T13:42:51	They're not evil henchmen plotting to quash the revolution. They're just avid party people who want a Dem president and more elected Dems.
JoyAnnReid	717708813877555200	2016-04-06T13:41:30	Supers I've talked to -- the ordinary folks, who are local and precinct level activists, emphasize that party building aspect 1st &amp; foremost
JoyAnnReid	717708375128162304	2016-04-06T13:39:45	There are definitely Dems who want to build a progressive movement from *within* the party, and some of them are w/ Sanders as superDs.
JoyAnnReid	717707942888345600	2016-04-06T13:38:02	Sanders is building a movement. He's not trying to build the Democratic Party. So his and superD's interests don't necessarily align.
JoyAnnReid	717707715406143488	2016-04-06T13:37:08	Don't underestimate the party building aspect among superdelegates. They are party activists whose goal is to elect lots more Democrats.
JoyAnnReid	717707420869505025	2016-04-06T13:35:58	Sure, but many of them also have a long, personal relationship with Clintons. Also she's the Dem, and they are Dems. 
JoyAnnReid	717706127782330373	2016-04-06T13:30:49	In fact, Clinton went on a huge winning streak at the end of the '08 cycle, going 6 for 9 and she actually closed winning the popular vote.
JoyAnnReid	717705852782772225	2016-04-06T13:29:44	Remember 2008 started earlier and was more front-loaded than the current cycle. By this point in '08 Clinton was winning states to no avail.
JoyAnnReid	717705439786483712	2016-04-06T13:28:05	That's actually not true. Obama had an insurmountable delegate lead before March. Flashback:  
JoyAnnReid	717703804276203521	2016-04-06T13:21:35	Pennypark why unfair?

JoyAnnReid	717702725459435520	2016-04-06T13:17:18	I do agree the mass media has a lot of leverage though, ITO who gets incl in polls &amp; debates, who gets coverage etc. 
JoyAnnReid	717702319710867456	2016-04-06T13:15:41	Y and N re the DNC chair. States &amp; state parties control a lot of the process. Good primer:  
JoyAnnReid	717695190211936261	2016-04-06T12:47:22	Except that isn't happening. The same person has more votes, more pledged delegates and more superdelegates. 
JoyAnnReid	717694754536996864	2016-04-06T12:45:38	kocoluv recbrasil5 elyse4design also that.
JoyAnnReid	717670177819766784	2016-04-06T11:07:58	And generally the young. That's why Sanders wins them vs Clinton but turnout is &lt; Republicans 
JoyAnnReid	717669783920054273	2016-04-06T11:06:24	So the votes of southern Democrats should count less than those in Utah or Idaho? Why?  
JoyAnnReid	717669253705543681	2016-04-06T11:04:18	So given that relatively tiny numbers of people caucus, one caucus delegate is valued at many thousands of ppl too.  
JoyAnnReid	717668949240971264	2016-04-06T11:03:05	The proportion of people who have the time to caucus vs vote in primaries is tiny, and favors wealthier, older etc. 
JoyAnnReid	717668358242566144	2016-04-06T11:00:44	Oh girl, yes I do.  
JoyAnnReid	717668090566348804	2016-04-06T10:59:41	And just by way of information, superdelegates aren't the source of Clinton's 200+ lead. Regular delegates are.  
JoyAnnReid	717667813377359872	2016-04-06T10:58:34	Caucuses aren't exactly democratic either, yet they've lingeres since the 18th century.

JoyAnnReid	717655566898868224	2016-04-06T10:09:55	So don't hate on proportionality. It's just math being math.
JoyAnnReid	717655379509977088	2016-04-06T10:09:10	Without proportionality, and given that she's won more (20-16) and much larger states, Hillary Clinton would be much further ahead.
JoyAnnReid	717655050722611201	2016-04-06T10:07:52	This is the proportionality won by Jesse Jackson in 1984, and while it may not seem like it this cycle, it actually helps insurgents.
JoyAnnReid	717654471103393792	2016-04-06T10:05:33	For context: Barack Obama shellacked Hillary Clinton by 17 points in 2008 but like Sanders, he too netted just +10 delegates.
JoyAnnReid	717654163442765824	2016-04-06T10:04:20	Clinton also has commitments from seven unpledged/superdelegates in Wisconsin so the final tally will be 46-43 at the convention.

JoyAnnReid	717164265954742272	2016-04-05T01:37:39	regwag2003 I say this without pejorative: no, I don't think he has thought through those things. I think he is going on belief.
JoyAnnReid	717164096555249664	2016-04-05T01:36:59	MonzterofSurrey the answer "revolution" and "millions of people will demand it" is the general response.
JoyAnnReid	717164017287106561	2016-04-05T01:36:40	MonzterofSurrey I'm no millionaire. And if you read the NYDailyNews interview, he repeatedly can't or won't explain how he'd do any of it.
JoyAnnReid	717163824911097857	2016-04-05T01:35:54	cliff_OP I get it, you're a zealot. But the fact is people know little about Sanders but the gauzy '60s narrative. Hence his high positives
JoyAnnReid	717162879506595840	2016-04-05T01:32:09	Great to see Yamiche on maddow right now talking about the big nytimes piece she cowrote.
JoyAnnReid	717162723042279425	2016-04-05T01:31:32	He also happens to be running against someone who has spent decades wonking out about policy, and being a Democrat.
JoyAnnReid	717162209005146112	2016-04-05T01:29:29	He was a message candidate. Clearly at some point that changed and the "how" (plus going negative, against his original id) has tripped him.
JoyAnnReid	717161851952488449	2016-04-05T01:28:04	But the nytimes piece from yesterday makes it clear he didn't initially run thinking he would actually be president. He wasn't a "how" cand
JoyAnnReid	717161682640969728	2016-04-05T01:27:24	One more note on that NYDailyNews Sanders interview: I do think it is vintage Sanders; long on true belief, short on the "how."
JoyAnnReid	717151984915202049	2016-04-05T00:48:51	Kiriende Tess30684384 bgolshahi1 Karoli the church folks will tell it, won't they?

JoyAnnReid	717151393790959616	2016-04-05T00:46:30	ThomboyD WolfNW and it is what attracted people to him. Going negative, in hopes of taking Clinton down, has detracted from that.
JoyAnnReid	717151063078473728	2016-04-05T00:45:12	ThomboyD WolfNW it gives the interview the vibe of talking to an activist, not a presidential candidate. But I think it is classic Sanders
JoyAnnReid	717150946791399424	2016-04-05T00:44:44	ThomboyD WolfNW I think he clearly hasn't thought through the finer details of what he wants to do in terms of governing. ...

JoyAnnReid	717150146748932096	2016-04-05T00:41:33	If you distill the NYDailyNews piece with the gloomy nytimes read, you could conclude Sanders' campaign was at some pt, taken off course.
JoyAnnReid	717149754204024833	2016-04-05T00:40:00	This NYDailyNews int is well worth a read: Sanders as he originally ran: w/ a coherent, singular, liberal worldview 
JoyAnnReid	717149138593390592	2016-04-05T00:37:33	It's actually an extraordinary interview and I think captures Sanders at his best: passionate about his core issues. 
JoyAnnReid	717141454183915521	2016-04-05T00:07:01	maramcewin well thank you :)

JoyAnnReid	717140271616638976	2016-04-05T00:02:19	Correct. And you see how well that worked out for her. 
JoyAnnReid	717140055387668480	2016-04-05T00:01:27	Your thoughts on Utah and Idaho? 
JoyAnnReid	717139728462712832	2016-04-05T00:00:09	A dose of electoral reality:

JoyAnnReid	717138601281249280	2016-04-04T23:55:40	Indeed, the dismissal doesn't hold up when you win a red state, and *all these voters deserve a chance to weigh in. 
JoyAnnReid	717138181964042240	2016-04-04T23:54:01	waltb31 bgolshahi1 Karoli what Robbins said was bigger than that -- that SC isn't important, period.
JoyAnnReid	717137975742738433	2016-04-04T23:53:11	.bgolshahi1 Karoli Synergism3 lastly, I take it you don't think Idaho, which will likely go Republican in November, is important?
JoyAnnReid	717137668891623425	2016-04-04T23:51:58	.bgolshahi1 Karoli not to mention the fact that South Carolina has been among the most predictive states for both party's nominees.

JoyAnnReid	717137019416219650	2016-04-04T23:49:23	.bgolshahi1 Karoli and since we're front-dot debating now, SC is the first state in the calendar with a significant number of black voters
JoyAnnReid	717136914290249728	2016-04-04T23:48:58	.bgolshahi1 Karoli and yet no one dismisses the results out of those states as "exaggerated in importance."
JoyAnnReid	717136813811494912	2016-04-04T23:48:34	.bgolshahi1 Karoli the importance given to SC is the same clout given to IA and NH, which are much less representative.

JoyAnnReid	717136475473715204	2016-04-04T23:47:14	bgolshahi1 Synergism3 Karoli docrocktex26 particularly since in doing so, one is dismissing a whole lot of black voters, and for what?

JoyAnnReid	717114364407463936	2016-04-04T22:19:22	MonteSpice one mustn't state facts that don't advance the cause. That apparently is the rule.
JoyAnnReid	717114223655067649	2016-04-04T22:18:48	miekezylstra smoothkobra I think what you've done there is to say "when my guy does it, it's pure." So thanks for playing.
JoyAnnReid	717114008239751169	2016-04-04T22:17:57	JonathanJewel MSNBC meant "hi there." :)
JoyAnnReid	717113968465211392	2016-04-04T22:17:48	@JonathanJewel um, high there. This is a simple fact about campaigns. Do you want such facts ignored because they don't favor your guy?
JoyAnnReid	717113593850933253	2016-04-04T22:16:18	Exactly. No matter what her policy ideas the charge is donations are more influential. Whither personal investments? 
JoyAnnReid	717113189582901248	2016-04-04T22:14:42	miekezylstra smoothkobra personal finances make him a tool of those industries? The logic of it only works that one way.

JoyAnnReid	717113017272569856	2016-04-04T22:14:01	miekezylstra smoothkobra makes her a tool of those industries, even though such donations don't benefit her personal finances. So...
JoyAnnReid	717112918895144960	2016-04-04T22:13:37	miekezylstra smoothkobra but that IS the logic. He says Clinton taking campaign donations from individuals who work in "bad" industries...
JoyAnnReid	717112627625852928	2016-04-04T22:12:28	JSlip1 indeed.
JoyAnnReid	717112526299926532	2016-04-04T22:12:04	mcnamee_kevin the theory of crossover voting is almost always more powerful than the fact of it.
JoyAnnReid	717112459224547329	2016-04-04T22:11:48	mcnamee_kevin maybe. It's hard to say. You have to start with the proposition that most Rs will vote R (and most Ds D) no matter what.
JoyAnnReid	717112260553007104	2016-04-04T22:11:00	JSlip1 exactly. He (and Ms. Palin) speak English the way I speak Spanish -- like they're hunting for the right words mid-sentence.

JoyAnnReid	717044184377663488	2016-04-04T17:40:30	JimmyFNmac I think it should. That's as valid an issue as any. Particularly since it goes directly to his message and brand.
JoyAnnReid	717043849869320192	2016-04-04T17:39:10	Byarr15 jfreewright well it's not like cronyism and corruption weren't rampant in the parties during his time (and before) as well.
JoyAnnReid	717043568972529665	2016-04-04T17:38:03	JimmyFNmac I tweeted that out earlier. I think it's an inevitable backlash to the Sanders campaign going negative. More scrutiny on him.
JoyAnnReid	717042672834371586	2016-04-04T17:34:29	Indeed. 
JoyAnnReid	717042526679613440	2016-04-04T17:33:55	@iamdanielsj remember, John Lewis as a SNCC leader was more radical than King was. King and others were called on to reign him in.
JoyAnnReid	717042318952554496	2016-04-04T17:33:05	@iamdanielsj indeed, considerably more radical. But he was also a hard-nosed pragmatist when he needed to be.
JoyAnnReid	717040741013446657	2016-04-04T17:26:49	.mcnamee_kevin campaign operatives always want their candidate to attack. But attacking raises your negatives along w/ your opponent's.
JoyAnnReid	717040607781380096	2016-04-04T17:26:17	The thing is, when you go negative, you get a response, both from your opponent, and ITO more scrutiny from media. 
JoyAnnReid	717040498620440576	2016-04-04T17:25:51	Well a year in, he really hasn't faced any. I think his supporters have become accustomed to that environment. 
JoyAnnReid	717040281439379460	2016-04-04T17:24:59	AlienMarmoset no kidding.
JoyAnnReid	717039909421379586	2016-04-04T17:23:31	King was the ultimate pragmatist, not an anarchist. Rewrite him to suit your campaign preferences all you want, tho. 
JoyAnnReid	717039741972180992	2016-04-04T17:22:51	King had no problem ... zero ... negotiating with power, or spurning it (namely LBJ on Vietnam) when necessary. 
JoyAnnReid	717039575496073216	2016-04-04T17:22:11	First, never once have I "suggested" let alone told people who to vote for. Second, King worked closely with LBJ. 
JoyAnnReid	717039326828302337	2016-04-04T17:21:12	I rather doubt it. By 1967, George Wallace had higher Gallup ratings than King. The right despised him. 
JoyAnnReid	717038498054860800	2016-04-04T17:17:54	Among them many perils of negative campaigning is that it triggers more scrutiny of you. Sanders' Wall St. petard: 
JoyAnnReid	717037790119268352	2016-04-04T17:15:05	Indeed. And King was clear in pushing the unheard to fight for the vote, and then to use it. He was no anarchist. 
JoyAnnReid	717036057817165824	2016-04-04T17:08:12	Indeed. 
JoyAnnReid	717035981279469569	2016-04-04T17:07:54	ICYMI:

JoyAnnReid	717032511621214208	2016-04-04T16:54:07	TimFromLA and thanks for the love :)
JoyAnnReid	717032479962611712	2016-04-04T16:53:59	TimFromLA in a way, yes, since that's normally the basis of apportioning representatives. The plaintiffs wanted to change that.
JoyAnnReid	717032244125310979	2016-04-04T16:53:03	T_FisherKing Synergism3 ok thanks
JoyAnnReid	717032070392971265	2016-04-04T16:52:22	@OliverWestLFC well.... he wrote a concurring opinion opposing the "one person one vote" standard. So he didn't really agree in total.
JoyAnnReid	717031792025452545	2016-04-04T16:51:15	TimFromLA hope that helps!
JoyAnnReid	717031766599548928	2016-04-04T16:51:09	TimFromLA the court ruled that TX can't be required to draw districts that way. But it didn't rule they CAN'T. So in future, states may try
JoyAnnReid	717031621589934081	2016-04-04T16:50:35	TimFromLA the plaintiffs wanted to REQUIRE Texas to draw state districts that way. It would have all but guaranteed GOP rule in perpetuity.
JoyAnnReid	717031480120250369	2016-04-04T16:50:01	TimFromLA and that is the goal. If you exclude large swaths of young people, POC etc from the pool you can draw more Republican districts.
JoyAnnReid	717031307935612929	2016-04-04T16:49:20	TimFromLA that would shrink the population TX based its reps on, especially in areas w/ large, unregistered Hispanic populations...
JoyAnnReid	717031155195838469	2016-04-04T16:48:43	TimFromLA which would mean the number of state reps/state senators would be based only on citizen adults, non-felons, etc....
JoyAnnReid	717030912114999296	2016-04-04T16:47:45	TimFromLA don't discount yourself. Basically, the TX plaintiffs wanted the state to draw districts based only on eligible voters...
JoyAnnReid	717030647282470912	2016-04-04T16:46:42	LOL yes! That is absolutely true! ;) 
JoyAnnReid	717029021855399937	2016-04-04T16:40:15	T_FisherKing Synergism3 do you have a link? Who is the author?
JoyAnnReid	717027354292449281	2016-04-04T16:33:37	BARBOHIO5 cheers :)
JoyAnnReid	717027228891090944	2016-04-04T16:33:07	In other words, Evenwell likely isn't the end. It's probably the beginning. Watch for round two. VotingRights
JoyAnnReid	717027046459838464	2016-04-04T16:32:24	And the bottom line, from paulwaldman1 (Full article: ) 
JoyAnnReid	717026853836468225	2016-04-04T16:31:38	2/3 from paulwaldman1 
JoyAnnReid	717026755354234881	2016-04-04T16:31:14	First of three key points from paulwaldman1 1/3 
JoyAnnReid	717026616182964225	2016-04-04T16:30:41	Very important article -- and warning -- re today's Evenwell SCOTUS decision on population-based representation. 
JoyAnnReid	717025296831148032	2016-04-04T16:25:27	to_nourish Sonia6349 "you're"...
JoyAnnReid	717025173329813505	2016-04-04T16:24:57	jfreewright indeed. Thank God he knows what's best for our people. What would we do without his largesse?
JoyAnnReid	717024909189361664	2016-04-04T16:23:54	EllenMignone chrislhayes jheil MarkHalperin costareports thank you :)
JoyAnnReid	717024713999040512	2016-04-04T16:23:08	Synergism3 yeah I don't even venture onto Reddit. Not interested in imbibing that much bile.
JoyAnnReid	717023201285566464	2016-04-04T16:17:07	Synergism3 it has a real Gamergate vibe to it. Same thing happened there.
JoyAnnReid	717023054338121728	2016-04-04T16:16:32	Gavrielia CapehartJ I'm not sure. I've seen Twitter rumblings of Tom foolery there, but hard to substantiate them.
JoyAnnReid	717021942671347712	2016-04-04T16:12:07	Synergism3 but yes, it's also the Messianic vibe that campaign has taken on. It encourages and exacerbates the online mobbing.
JoyAnnReid	717021790074191872	2016-04-04T16:11:31	Synergism3 I think part of it is age - and the aggressive, unfiltered environment they've been nurtured in on social media.
JoyAnnReid	717020811761156096	2016-04-04T16:07:37	FDRforever if you have access to fresh ginger, a good, hot-boiled ginger tea with honey works WONDERS.

JoyAnnReid	717020139552694273	2016-04-04T16:04:57	Synergism3 well unless Jesus The Christ gets on the ballot in New York, I'm not down for worship. Not even on Sundays.
JoyAnnReid	717019416312090624	2016-04-04T16:02:05	This too. All of this. 
JoyAnnReid	717018705704706048	2016-04-04T15:59:15	I feel the need to do this again. You love your candidate? Bully for you. Do save the racist, sexist, holier-than-thou crap for your Tumblr.
JoyAnnReid	717018027544485888	2016-04-04T15:56:33	Thank you!

JoyAnnReid	717014285243781121	2016-04-04T15:41:41	Here's a great primer on the Evenwell case the court just ruled on:

JoyAnnReid	717012974603468801	2016-04-04T15:36:29	BarnesJhbtre debdlund will also find and post some good links for quick reads.
JoyAnnReid	717012905422618624	2016-04-04T15:36:12	I recommend following AriBerman (and reading his book "Give us the ballot), Sifill_LDF &amp; SCOTUSblog for starters 
JoyAnnReid	717012309080739841	2016-04-04T15:33:50	tmwinsett for real :)
JoyAnnReid	717012260057702401	2016-04-04T15:33:38	tmwinsett AdamSerwer wouldn't you love to put him in a time machine and read his concurring opinion on Dred Scott?
JoyAnnReid	717012020923645953	2016-04-04T15:32:41	Yeah, he pretty much slays at ironic thinking.  
JoyAnnReid	717011813573988352	2016-04-04T15:31:52	Llorac11 mostly I'm just really glad you're engaged and participating. Please don't get discouraged!
JoyAnnReid	717011706841575425	2016-04-04T15:31:27	Llorac11 it's not the best system (and IMO caucuses are much worse than primaries) but your vote does count for something, believe me.
JoyAnnReid	717011490285490177	2016-04-04T15:30:35	Llorac11 so basically, they're divided up according to the share of the vote each candidate wins. Then they vote at the nat'l convention.
JoyAnnReid	717011254859153409	2016-04-04T15:29:39	Llorac11 an unfortunate artifact of America's original, elitist system for picking presidents. But they are picked based on your vote.
JoyAnnReid	717010837332967425	2016-04-04T15:27:59	And by the way the ruling was unanimous (though Alito and Thomas wrote concurring opinions rather than joining RBG). 
JoyAnnReid	717009467490041857	2016-04-04T15:22:33	Yes, this was a good day for voters. SCOTUS 
JoyAnnReid	717009335856054274	2016-04-04T15:22:01	Llorac11 it means everything, actually! Especially if you keep doing it - in every election, local, state and federal. Be encouraged.

JoyAnnReid	716842402435170304	2016-04-04T04:18:41	joe_nilo FiveThirtyEight that's the outcome I've been assuming. Just an odd confluence of gloom from Sandersland.
JoyAnnReid	716842230686855168	2016-04-04T04:18:00	Indeed. It's a hazard of the profession, unfortunately. But annoying nonetheless. 
JoyAnnReid	716841992123244544	2016-04-04T04:17:03	Even worse timing: the gloomy, leaky Times piece comes as Clinton supporters begin hammering Sanders for not releasing his tax returns.
JoyAnnReid	716841514991755264	2016-04-04T04:15:10	AModelsMom2011 mzbitca correct. And they know she can take a punch. Sanders has yet to be swung at, let alone hit.
JoyAnnReid	716841365854896128	2016-04-04T04:14:34	Tell me about it... just still galls me!  
JoyAnnReid	716841269553659904	2016-04-04T04:14:11	@iamdanielsj perhaps!
JoyAnnReid	716841111122284544	2016-04-04T04:13:33	PCalith SharonJ44257163 interesting.
JoyAnnReid	716840786265030656	2016-04-04T04:12:16	Meanwhile, WI getting more interesting for the Ds, with FiveThirtyEight posting conflicting forecasts: 
JoyAnnReid	716839928575959040	2016-04-04T04:08:51	And like senior advisers throwing their own candidate under the bus ... 
JoyAnnReid	716838669668249600	2016-04-04T04:03:51	SharonJ44257163 yes, I believe Kerry is a Clinton endorser.
JoyAnnReid	716838314997841920	2016-04-04T04:02:27	BlackBizNow I don't "have" to support anyone, nor do I. I write and tweet what I think is going on. But thanks and have a good night.
JoyAnnReid	716837906963369984	2016-04-04T04:00:49	I'm now wondering if that 2-point CBS poll today is more telling than a little bit. WIPrimary 
JoyAnnReid	716837600733110273	2016-04-04T03:59:36	And wasn't it just today the campaign was implying they're about to hold a massive rally in Central Park, w/ Sanders vowing to win NY?
JoyAnnReid	716836983696461824	2016-04-04T03:57:09	Just a strange, strange thing to read on my TWD night!
JoyAnnReid	716836818155601920	2016-04-04T03:56:30	Especially one that reads like Sanders' high priced advisers prepping to blame the candidate for not letting them damage his brand earlier.
JoyAnnReid	716836657966751745	2016-04-04T03:55:52	But seriously, I find it really strange that multiple people close to the Sanders campaign would feed an obit before Wisconsin even happens.
JoyAnnReid	716836291854409728	2016-04-04T03:54:24	And see? I wasn't gonna tweet about politics tonight. Thanks, nytimes üòñ
JoyAnnReid	716835166484869120	2016-04-04T03:49:56	Indeed! I still remember losing a seventh grade spelling bee by adding an extra "n" to Renaissance. Ruined my day :( 
JoyAnnReid	716834686392213504	2016-04-04T03:48:02	Interesting, though in the world of politics, not surprising. 
JoyAnnReid	716833795404611584	2016-04-04T03:44:29	I found it strange, frankly. Reads like an '08 Mark Penn lament over the candidate not getting dirtier earlier.  
JoyAnnReid	716829499510374400	2016-04-04T03:27:25	Congratulations, young man! *throws confetti*

JoyAnnReid	716691509672878080	2016-04-03T18:19:06	Agreed. Would love to see a strong piece from an expert! 
JoyAnnReid	716691388218388481	2016-04-03T18:18:37	The whole process is too antiquated for a modern democracy, frankly. 
JoyAnnReid	716691062530711552	2016-04-03T18:17:19	Not enough to change anything. The 20 states Clinton won are larger and have more delegates than Sanders' 15. 
JoyAnnReid	716690651761491968	2016-04-03T18:15:41	Yep 
JoyAnnReid	716690583738302464	2016-04-03T18:15:25	BTW it won't matter really, given Clinton's 220+ delegate lead. But it's a peek into the arcane caucus/delegate election process.
JoyAnnReid	716690253864677380	2016-04-03T18:14:06	Correct. 
JoyAnnReid	716690201377157120	2016-04-03T18:13:54	Girl...  
JoyAnnReid	716690141566386176	2016-04-03T18:13:39	Important clarification: 
JoyAnnReid	716689998335098883	2016-04-03T18:13:05	Nope 
JoyAnnReid	716689857964285953	2016-04-03T18:12:32	True indeed 
JoyAnnReid	716689297399631874	2016-04-03T18:10:18	JoyAnnReid so some areas had no representatives But the outcome for 4th Congressional District remained same 3 for Bernie and 2 for HRC 4/
JoyAnnReid	716689577981808641	2016-04-03T18:11:25	Odd...  
JoyAnnReid	716689304110698496	2016-04-03T18:10:20	Hence, the North Dakota state convention, where maybe 1600 people will select 28 delegates to the national convention.
JoyAnnReid	716688980117491712	2016-04-03T18:09:02	That and the state convention chaos ...  
JoyAnnReid	716688637019222016	2016-04-03T18:07:41	Correct! And with Ron Paul and Mitt Romney, I believe in Maine? Produced a walkout protest on the RNC floor, even!  
JoyAnnReid	716688413190176769	2016-04-03T18:06:47	You know what they used to call primaries? "Beauty contests." üëØüëØüëØ
JoyAnnReid	716688011178745860	2016-04-03T18:05:11	And by the way, caucuses and state conventions, not large, higher participation primaries, are the way US elections ran until the 1960s.
JoyAnnReid	716687793737572352	2016-04-03T18:04:20	And so while abt 80,000 Dems participated in the Nevada caucuses, &lt;6,000 people will pick the national delegation. 
JoyAnnReid	716687389608046592	2016-04-03T18:02:43	But the people who got elected as delegates on caucus night actually have to show up at the convention. If not... 
JoyAnnReid	716687115497705472	2016-04-03T18:01:38	So Hillary Clinton wins Nevada 52.6%-47.3%, right? But that's just the election for the STATE convention, where... 
JoyAnnReid	716686455125446656	2016-04-03T17:59:00	Why many people think caucuses are undemocratic, in three tweets, via that theinquisitr article sanacardi sent me. Here we go...

JoyAnnReid	716101529351155713	2016-04-02T03:14:43	nenagerman girl, I shudder to think...
JoyAnnReid	716101473491398657	2016-04-02T03:14:30	MrsRochesterNY kpoldy RiseUp2000 davidsirota I think he's what we used to call an "emoprog." So I don't pay him any attention.
JoyAnnReid	716101205143982081	2016-04-02T03:13:26	Only4RM PragObots I'm not even sure it's all that low key...
JoyAnnReid	716101073342169088	2016-04-02T03:12:55	daddio7775 I wouldn't be surprised if one or more new parties emerges, on left and right. Question is size and electability.
JoyAnnReid	716100821000306688	2016-04-02T03:11:54	clarlune most are full-time. Has been that way for quite a while: 
JoyAnnReid	716100525394034688	2016-04-02T03:10:44	chilov true. You can't heap the 90s on her. She has a record of her own that extends through 2014.
JoyAnnReid	716100385656582145	2016-04-02T03:10:11	ABswl16 PragObots Only4RM I have no idea. I do think his general view seems to be that current/Obama economic policies are inadequate.
JoyAnnReid	716100071130066944	2016-04-02T03:08:56	PragObots Only4RM meanwhile, a smallish number of white working class conservatives are in full-on revolt.
JoyAnnReid	716099942679519232	2016-04-02T03:08:25	PragObots Only4RM the relatively good economy, eased war footing and stable current president leave few Dems feeling like rebelling.
JoyAnnReid	716099684545089536	2016-04-02T03:07:23	PragObots Only4RM most voters view this as merely an election (or a bid to stop Trump) not a revolutionary overthrow of entrenched systems
JoyAnnReid	716099379950657536	2016-04-02T03:06:11	Only4RM PragObots I think the biggest issue is that only a small number of people are up for a full-on overthrow of the parties.
JoyAnnReid	716098023261138944	2016-04-02T03:00:47	Jesus, take the wheel... 
JoyAnnReid	716096780832743424	2016-04-02T02:55:51	New pewresearch poll finds grave doubts among Republicans that their party will unite behind Trump. Not so, Dems: 
JoyAnnReid	716093824494387200	2016-04-02T02:44:06	In her interview on allinwithchris, Michelle Alexander calls for the creation of a new political party &amp; movement 
JoyAnnReid	716087393657421824	2016-04-02T02:18:33	Come on over! Hope to see you there :) 
JoyAnnReid	716080021249638400	2016-04-02T01:49:15	Exactly. Politicians, compromises, mistakes. Even the best of them. 
JoyAnnReid	716079422181416961	2016-04-02T01:46:53	Or the violent rollback of Reconstruction from the 1870s to the 1890s? Every era has its thorns. 
JoyAnnReid	716079296595562497	2016-04-02T01:46:23	What about the ugly racial compromises embedded in the New Deal, which involved deliberately excluding black people? 
JoyAnnReid	716079117091913730	2016-04-02T01:45:40	If I wasn't writing in Shirley Chisholm on April 19th, that's what I'd do :)
JoyAnnReid	716079016097226752	2016-04-02T01:45:16	Best to judge these candidates on what they are promising to do; and on their preparation, backgrounds, temperament and overall legacy, no?
JoyAnnReid	716078844743127041	2016-04-02T01:44:35	And most importantly, it's pretty disingenuous to lay the entire rap for the bad parts of the 90s on the then first lady.
JoyAnnReid	716078572822204416	2016-04-02T01:43:30	Mistakes that we're only now realizing the magnitude of. But policy mistakes have been made in every era, including the New Deal.
JoyAnnReid	716078373441773569	2016-04-02T01:42:42	It's just not accurate to recast them as this dismal hellscape. That said, many mistakes were made in policy by the Dem administration.
JoyAnnReid	716078278331789316	2016-04-02T01:42:20	If you're my age, the 90s were the business. Lots of jobs, Internet startups, opportunity (really good hip-hop...)
JoyAnnReid	716077925716660225	2016-04-02T01:40:56	But also an economic boom, 22 million net new jobs, record AA home ownership, new business starts &amp; elected offices. 
JoyAnnReid	716077613157072897	2016-04-02T01:39:41	MikeLucey21 when have I trashed Senator Sanders? Show your work: links please. I'll wait.
JoyAnnReid	716077356864110592	2016-04-02T01:38:40	People forget that, because it was such a walk back from what candidate Bill Clinton promised, but yes. 
JoyAnnReid	716077084242755584	2016-04-02T01:37:35	Black pastors, mayors, half the CBC... yes, there was definitely black support for the crime bill. itscomplicated 
JoyAnnReid	716076928176881664	2016-04-02T01:36:58	That too is true. Again, all politics and political legacies are complicated.  
JoyAnnReid	716076697842491392	2016-04-02T01:36:03	Love that. Supreme Commander! Not saying everyone feels any certain way, just relating what I *tend* to find. 
JoyAnnReid	716076527226630144	2016-04-02T01:35:22	'08 Obama would never have run on opening Cuba, doing a nuke deal with Iran, repealing DOMA... he'd have lost. 
JoyAnnReid	716076249530150912	2016-04-02T01:34:16	All political decisions of any importance are difficult and often involve painful compromises. There is no purity. 
JoyAnnReid	716075930456821760	2016-04-02T01:33:00	sanacardi true. You can't pick a candidate based on what they were doing 30 or 50 years ago alone.
JoyAnnReid	716075589459951616	2016-04-02T01:31:39	.IJefTomI hence the call from some including Sanders, Cornel West etc to primary Pres. Obama in '12.
JoyAnnReid	716075263478603776	2016-04-02T01:30:21	Indeed. And clearly some liberals see him as an agent of neoliberalism "posing" as a progressive. 1/2 
JoyAnnReid	716074792361791488	2016-04-02T01:28:29	You had me at "dialectical materialism" :) nerdsrule 
JoyAnnReid	716074422239674368	2016-04-02T01:27:00	Absolutely right. And the movement is incremental at the same time it is seismic. 
JoyAnnReid	716074227087118336	2016-04-02T01:26:14	Sanders is tapping into people, many outside the two-party system, who are rebelling against much more systemic forces larger than parties.
JoyAnnReid	716073760558878720	2016-04-02T01:24:23	So any "revolution" would be against the era that already repudiated the Clinton era. Most Dems see no need for that. Hence, Hillary's lead.
JoyAnnReid	716073343292719104	2016-04-02T01:22:43	Case in point: Hillary Clinton is running more as an Obama Democrat than a Clinton Democrat. And even Obama is more liberal than '08 Obama.
JoyAnnReid	716073073712242693	2016-04-02T01:21:39	The Obama era in many ways represents a belated victory of the Democratic left in nudging the party leftward post Bill Clinton.
JoyAnnReid	716072838998986752	2016-04-02T01:20:43	That's partly because so many of the compromises of that era, on LGBT rights and criminal justice, have been repudiated in the Obama era.
JoyAnnReid	716072716021940224	2016-04-02T01:20:14	One of the "who woulda thunk it" aspects of this cycle is how the 90s, as a thing, have been cut off from Hillary Clinton as an asset.
JoyAnnReid	716072283060772865	2016-04-02T01:18:30	.RiseUp2000 I do think media in general has a narrative of Bernie as saint and Hillary as suspect, which serves neither one of them well.
JoyAnnReid	716071845989117952	2016-04-02T01:16:46	And people forget, Bill Clinton's econ policies involved injecting $ directly into cities, where most AAs live. 
JoyAnnReid	716071584289542144	2016-04-02T01:15:44	It was a good era economically for AAs; the best in a very long time. And as Alexander points out, ITO WH access. 
JoyAnnReid	716070432550625281	2016-04-02T01:11:09	I go into my analysis of the 2016 Dem primary believing that neither candidate is all saint or all sinner. They're ... complicated.
JoyAnnReid	716070127213625345	2016-04-02T01:09:56	I think people should take ALL of the info into account (and find more than the info media are giving you) and vote. 
JoyAnnReid	716069925119459329	2016-04-02T01:09:08	However, I think decisions on voting are more complex than that, as are the Clinton legacy, and Sanders' record. 2/2 
JoyAnnReid	716069551046262785	2016-04-02T01:07:39	I can't/don't tell anyone what to do. Having written touching heavily on that era, I relate to the ambivalence. 1/2 
JoyAnnReid	716069118114447360	2016-04-02T01:05:56	Could be that younger black Americans are "discovering" the Clinton era via works like Michelle Alexander's and not liking what they see.
JoyAnnReid	716068822483091460	2016-04-02T01:04:45	The interesting thing I've found traveling around the country is that AA Clinton ambivalence seems to decline with age.
JoyAnnReid	716068588642295808	2016-04-02T01:03:50	Alexander correctly articulates the core of ambivalence by some African-Americans (particularly GenX and younger) about the Clintons.
JoyAnnReid	716068429661413376	2016-04-02T01:03:12	...of the Democratic takeover of Nixon era "tough on crime" politics, aimed at trading black pain for white suburban votes.
JoyAnnReid	716068196495847424	2016-04-02T01:02:16	Michelle Alexander recounted the dark side of the Clinton era, which were both the first opening of WH power to black America and the start
JoyAnnReid	716067406100172800	2016-04-02T00:59:08	politicswthsoul allinwithchris wait, quotes are forbidden now??? Ah, the policing of punctuation....

JoyAnnReid	716059653239652353	2016-04-02T00:28:19	Karma indeed. It's upside-down 2012!  
JoyAnnReid	716059373009768448	2016-04-02T00:27:12	And btw that ugly campaign tipping point usually is reached at the point where the math meets the president a candidate sees in the mirror.
JoyAnnReid	716057436076052482	2016-04-02T00:19:31	Remember the "shame on you, Barack Obama!" 3am call, likeable enuf, spittle-flecked phase of the '08 campaign? Clinton and Sanders are there

JoyAnnReid	716055242018832384	2016-04-02T00:10:48	skepticalarrow it's an awkward trick runnning inside a party that's not your own, and that you didn't sign up to "build."
JoyAnnReid	716055033717121024	2016-04-02T00:09:58	skepticalarrow I think that's a very valid point. And maybe some will prefer to see money go to indies or greens even in the fall.

JoyAnnReid	716051547231281152	2016-04-01T23:56:07	Reality: hard to run for office without money. Every pol has funders they don't love. And yes, winning is the point. 
JoyAnnReid	716051216711688192	2016-04-01T23:54:48	Ask the finserv and hedge fund people who gave heavily to Obama in 2008, but hated his guts by 2012 over Dodd Frank, no WH invites etc.
JoyAnnReid	716050934858653697	2016-04-01T23:53:41	But the bottom line is these industries give to everyone, in hopes they'll have some access and influence. Sometimes they win, s'times not.
JoyAnnReid	716050446419361792	2016-04-01T23:51:44	.BeachPeanuts KevinDarryl looked at that way it's spectacular how wrong they've been re Repubs. And yes, some did place bets on Sanders.
JoyAnnReid	716050110459867136	2016-04-01T23:50:24	Another way to read this kind of data is as a gauge of who the industry believes it will be dealing with in the WH. 
JoyAnnReid	716048383526498304	2016-04-01T23:43:32	Donald Trump unpopularity watch. 
JoyAnnReid	716048944539770880	2016-04-01T23:45:46	Agreed. Literally going into interviews cold. Bizarre at any level; insane at the presidential tier.

JoyAnnReid	716019989636128769	2016-04-01T21:50:43	This is true. 
JoyAnnReid	716019872770179072	2016-04-01T21:50:15	A few people tweeting it, but I see zero chance of Sanders on the ticket. Rem Kerry-Edwards? Rancorous, oppositional tickets don't work.

JoyAnnReid	716018523592589312	2016-04-01T21:44:53	I tend to agree. Though I see nothing but rising power and influence for her no matter what. 
JoyAnnReid	716017932506173440	2016-04-01T21:42:32	Indeed. I'd rather be a big city mayor than a Senator any day!  
JoyAnnReid	716017836829904896	2016-04-01T21:42:09	Because picking them put their governorships in play, and Dems lost both. 
JoyAnnReid	716017656407654404	2016-04-01T21:41:26	I don't know much about Malloy, but I doubt they'd go with a blue state governor. They'll already win CT. 
JoyAnnReid	716017279494959104	2016-04-01T21:39:57	Not even close. Their party is about 90 percent white in terms of voters. 
JoyAnnReid	716016919162257409	2016-04-01T21:38:31	Backstorymom1 z_hall1 Dems always win New England. And they definitely win MA.

JoyAnnReid	716016239827632128	2016-04-01T21:35:49	Lawrence EdgeofSports bijancbayne very true, but in this case, she seems to view her power base as centered there, not the WH.
JoyAnnReid	716015807122292736	2016-04-01T21:34:06	francisregan I think if the central issue weren't Wall Street, maybe someday? but even then unlikely. Dems want a Dem.
JoyAnnReid	716015467425611783	2016-04-01T21:32:45	.z_hall1 I think he has almost no chance - two people over 60 seems highly unlikely, and the race has gotten too negative for it to work.
JoyAnnReid	716015222268567552	2016-04-01T21:31:46	.z_hall1 I've written that this primary has elements of 1988, with Bernie in the role of Jesse Jackson, who also pushed for the veep nod.
JoyAnnReid	716015011731218432	2016-04-01T21:30:56	Will be looking to see if Bernie makes a play for it but I'd be shocked if HRC considered it, given the rancor now.

JoyAnnReid	716014321671741440	2016-04-01T21:28:11	PTAZGuy uh ok. See ya (or not). BTW not talking about race is no way to end racism. Heads in sand aren't helpful either.
JoyAnnReid	716014007535144960	2016-04-01T21:26:56	Agreed. 100 percent. 
JoyAnnReid	716013947904724992	2016-04-01T21:26:42	Thanks! Will give it a read :) 
JoyAnnReid	716013838039171076	2016-04-01T21:26:16	Remember the era of the big city Democratic mayor? That's where the Dem all-stars used to be grown. 
JoyAnnReid	716013756178890754	2016-04-01T21:25:57	That's certainly been the case as long as I've been paying attention to politics. Didn't used to be that way though. 
JoyAnnReid	716013584577376257	2016-04-01T21:25:16	Can't see that happening. He's still a Republican and she doesn't need foreign policy gravitas (or Iraq reminders). 
JoyAnnReid	716013330394120193	2016-04-01T21:24:15	A fair point. 
JoyAnnReid	716013269023072257	2016-04-01T21:24:00	That's part of why the Dems, the Clintons (and the Clooneys) are fundraising like crazy. 
JoyAnnReid	716013141054922753	2016-04-01T21:23:30	I just can't see it happening. He brings nothing (she has New York already), and he's not that progressive. 
JoyAnnReid	716012916772904960	2016-04-01T21:22:36	True indeed, but there are still plenty of people who want it. Power, even a little bit of power, is tempting. 
JoyAnnReid	716012755971604480	2016-04-01T21:21:58	Not a thing. I think he still is floating around. I'm just hearing buzz re Clintonworld focusing on other demos. 
JoyAnnReid	716012499603177473	2016-04-01T21:20:57	Virginia does have this mystical hold on Clinton and Obamaworld (the latter via Terry McAuliffe). But Warner brings? 
JoyAnnReid	716012306635866113	2016-04-01T21:20:11	.t_bladel thebillforeman EdgeofSports bijancbayne Dems don't view a Dem POC as a special commodity. And they take POC votes for granted.
JoyAnnReid	716012180785725440	2016-04-01T21:19:41	Because Republicans have more of a need for the appearance of diversity, and non-white conservs are a valuable find. 
JoyAnnReid	716011868171673600	2016-04-01T21:18:26	LOL egads.  
JoyAnnReid	716011813855477760	2016-04-01T21:18:13	Now that is some out of the box thinking! I don't see him doing that, though. And not with Clinton. 
JoyAnnReid	716011702500913155	2016-04-01T21:17:47	Yes. But that's why i'm so fixated on local elections. That's where the bench begins. 
JoyAnnReid	716011603217526785	2016-04-01T21:17:23	Karoli Warren is already, arguably, the most powerful Democrat in the Senate outside of Harry Reid. Sanders would join her in that echelon.
JoyAnnReid	716011210408374272	2016-04-01T21:15:50	ICUDrEd bijancbayne EdgeofSports I think their thinking would be: white male fix, progressive enthusiasm fix, regardless of age.
JoyAnnReid	716011023883485185	2016-04-01T21:15:05	ICUDrEd bijancbayne EdgeofSports I don't think that's how they're necessarily thinking about it. You don't want a Dan Quayle vibe.
JoyAnnReid	716010888273215488	2016-04-01T21:14:33	@hersheycrisses I go back and forth on that. Part of me really believes Garland is who Obama really wants. Part thinks strategy.
JoyAnnReid	716010688922128384	2016-04-01T21:13:45	Krisellyn doesn't matter. This cycle is the denouement of the Occupy movement. Hence, Sanders' and Warren's popularity.
JoyAnnReid	716010463369232387	2016-04-01T21:12:51	It's actually a scandal how few people of color the party has successfully fielded for positions on deck for POTUS. 
JoyAnnReid	716010325737390081	2016-04-01T21:12:19	The real problem for Democrats is the shocking lack of a deep bench of candidates of color in statewide offices. 
JoyAnnReid	716010176646619137	2016-04-01T21:11:43	TheSethGrossman Jewish voters go 70-90 percent Dem. Obama hit the "low point" of 67 percent in 2012.
JoyAnnReid	716010036074561536	2016-04-01T21:11:10	TimDNiles they always say no. But in reality I don't think he and Clintonworld get along. Not that that's prohibitive either.
JoyAnnReid	716009910731935745	2016-04-01T21:10:40	If you look at Obama's SCOTUS nom, it tells a story. Dems have a way of focusing on white indies at crunch-time. 
JoyAnnReid	716009649301020673	2016-04-01T21:09:37	I think that's his problem - and too many Wall Street ties.  
JoyAnnReid	716009482296434694	2016-04-01T21:08:58	Thanks. Well that doesn't help Sherrod Brown's chances. Dems likely won't take risks with retaking the Senate. 
JoyAnnReid	716009260132524034	2016-04-01T21:08:05	Oh I think it makes perfect sense. And he gives you a charismatic figure who knows media, has great name ID, is prog 
JoyAnnReid	716008961573519360	2016-04-01T21:06:53	Another good choice - progressive, and from a state with a Democratic governor who presumably could pick his repl. 
JoyAnnReid	716008587018039296	2016-04-01T21:05:24	I'm guessing Kasich would get the pick, which would be problematic. Any Ohioans know the answer? 
JoyAnnReid	716008383099363330	2016-04-01T21:04:35	Clintonworld and Obamaworld have this affinity for Virginia, for whatever reason. Not a 'charisma" choice at all LOL 
JoyAnnReid	716008110779998208	2016-04-01T21:03:31	The thing I would be dubious about would be Warren. Two women a tough sell, and why would Warren give up the Senate? 
JoyAnnReid	716007854935838720	2016-04-01T21:02:30	Stipulating that Biden should be VP for Life I doubt he'd do it. Cuomo is anti-charismatic &amp; she doesn't need Clark. 
JoyAnnReid	716007581433610240	2016-04-01T21:01:24	.EdgeofSports bijancbayne if they go that route, you might start seeing names like Tim Kaine and (I'd say stronger pick) Sherrod Brown.
JoyAnnReid	716007239857934338	2016-04-01T21:00:03	So I used to think Castro had the inside track, but now thinking they may look to fix their "white male problem."

JoyAnnReid	716006658535723008	2016-04-01T20:57:44	I hate to say this, but I doubt Trump would pick Brewer, given her age plus his stilted view of women's core asset. 
JoyAnnReid	716006377974579202	2016-04-01T20:56:37	I love this gif!

JoyAnnReid	716003961950638080	2016-04-01T20:47:01	The reporting I have suggests he loathes Trump. With a capital "L".

JoyAnnReid	716002887562895361	2016-04-01T20:42:45	Interesting (also frightening) thought experiment: who might marry their brand to Trump's as his running-mate?

JoyAnnReid	715774452341030913	2016-04-01T05:35:02	Not even close. 
JoyAnnReid	715774395625705472	2016-04-01T05:34:49	Instead, he gave the anti-abortion message straight, no chaser, taken to its logical conclusion.
JoyAnnReid	715774064879599616	2016-04-01T05:33:30	Had Trump been a movement conservative for the past 20 years he'd have known to give hardball_chris the "doctor bad" version re abortion.
JoyAnnReid	715773443271233537	2016-04-01T05:31:01	We in media are too quick to label people like Kasich, Rubio or Jeb as "moderate" based on presentation, no matter how far right on policy.
JoyAnnReid	715772045045399552	2016-04-01T05:25:28	Kasich, unlike Trump, is a textbook example of how better-marketed conservatism becomes "moderation" via the media.

JoyAnnReid	715764371889238016	2016-04-01T04:54:59	Heh. :) 
JoyAnnReid	715764313886162945	2016-04-01T04:54:45	Correct. 
JoyAnnReid	715764090241736705	2016-04-01T04:53:52	It's remarkable to watch. Truly. 
JoyAnnReid	715764005810409472	2016-04-01T04:53:31	Conversely, the attraction of a Reagan, Dubya, Paul Ryan or for a time, Rubio, was the ability to make many of those same ideas marketable.
JoyAnnReid	715763256074313728	2016-04-01T04:50:33	The real political sin of people like Trump, Todd Akin &amp; Romney (47%!) is revealing aspects of conservatism that can read as simple cruelty.
JoyAnnReid	715761198814339072	2016-04-01T04:42:22	It's all in the sales pitch. Always leave the side effects disclaimer 'til the end. 
JoyAnnReid	715761054958149636	2016-04-01T04:41:48	Bingo. 
JoyAnnReid	715760975744536577	2016-04-01T04:41:29	All of the above, plus it was almost April Fool's Day, so he was just doing a funny... :) 
JoyAnnReid	715760773474164737	2016-04-01T04:40:41	The initial excommunication of this nun implies that 4 the true believer the woman must die:  
JoyAnnReid	715760134870405121	2016-04-01T04:38:08	Because he broke the rules of anti-abortion, conservative politics, and his campaign was scrambling to fix it. 
JoyAnnReid	715759691666690049	2016-04-01T04:36:23	Hence, per Pat Robertson, the shift to focusing on the "abortion provider." Politics. It's more finger painting art than science.
JoyAnnReid	715759538033573888	2016-04-01T04:35:46	In other words: it would make it hard to elect anti-abortion conservatives if they admitted their policy plans would land women in prison.
JoyAnnReid	715759299293802496	2016-04-01T04:34:49	Best part is, Robertson admits in that clip that the reason the anti-abortion movement downplays the "criminal woman" part is politics.
JoyAnnReid	715759125272117248	2016-04-01T04:34:08	In fact, here's Pat Robertson making that very point, on the teevee: 
JoyAnnReid	715759022956273665	2016-04-01T04:33:43	Simply put: if you believe abortion is murder, than the woman seeking one has to be a criminal, presuming you believe she has agency.
JoyAnnReid	715758854173229057	2016-04-01T04:33:03	Trump, because he's not schooled in conservative politics, simply forgot to hide the "prosecute the woman" part of the anti-abortion cause.
JoyAnnReid	715758694856802305	2016-04-01T04:32:25	So maddow tonight said what the team and I were discussing in the office today: that Trump's abortion "gaffe" was no gaffe...

JoyAnnReid	715373176482635776	2016-03-31T03:00:30	bettybrite121 well I think even before tonight the only way you'd see them switch en masse is if he crushed HRC in NY, PA, MD and CA.
JoyAnnReid	715372453896327169	2016-03-31T02:57:38	That's certainly fair and possible. But it he's litmus testing downticket candidates, how to demand their support?

JoyAnnReid	715366504099942400	2016-03-31T02:34:00	The irony is that Sanders' "political revolution" is at least in part based on retaking congress, meaning electing downticket Dems.
JoyAnnReid	715366134028087298	2016-03-31T02:32:31	Sekhmara Tim_Canova Picus4Congress who's "we"? This was a question from Rachel Maddow to Senator Sanders.
JoyAnnReid	715365853911449600	2016-03-31T02:31:25	The Sanders answer on Dem party fundraising is interesting given that his campaign is pitching superdelegates, who are downticket Dems.

JoyAnnReid	715350467082121218	2016-03-31T01:30:16	Joseph100960 so you really did read it for the articles, then? :-)
JoyAnnReid	715350269345837056	2016-03-31T01:29:29	ABswl16 it's definitely unique in modern American politics. I'll give you that.
JoyAnnReid	715350052319936513	2016-03-31T01:28:37	ABswl16 in many ways, though, this group is different. They're much younger, w/ elements of Occupy and even Gamergate mixed in.
JoyAnnReid	715349402307665920	2016-03-31T01:26:02	ABswl16 ironically enough, the pro-Hillary PUMAs in 2008 were just as vile and vicious, and just as destructive to that campaign.
JoyAnnReid	715349069913317376	2016-03-31T01:24:43	scooniepenn thinking you're probably right ... :)

JoyAnnReid	715348326024159234	2016-03-31T01:21:46	ABswl16 and they may not even realize how much damage they're doing, among journalists, superdelegates, voters, etc.
JoyAnnReid	715348139570540545	2016-03-31T01:21:01	ABswl16 I'd say they are the single most unpleasant, unhelpful element of his campaign. They're creating no converts with their hysterics.

JoyAnnReid	715343646745296896	2016-03-31T01:03:10	jayctigerfan because people have turned campaigns into a kind of religion. And the politically religious are the worst kind of zealots.

JoyAnnReid	715342952734859264	2016-03-31T01:00:25	The thing about political zealotry, of all kinds, is that the aggressive sanctimony involved makes you completely unbearable.
JoyAnnReid	715341888899911681	2016-03-31T00:56:11	WillevaLindsey PoliticsPeach CAS2328 I blocked you? So how am I seeing this tweet? Happy to do it though if you'd prefer.

JoyAnnReid	715336344315236352	2016-03-31T00:34:09	PoliticsPeach CAS2328 my advice to you is that you tweet your rage and zealotry among your actual friends. I'm not really interested.

JoyAnnReid	715322570669703168	2016-03-30T23:39:25	plcarman I actually disagree on that. Having just research a book substantially about her, her ideology is more complicated than that.
JoyAnnReid	715322420043902976	2016-03-30T23:38:49	This is either a sign that John Kasich is great at reaching across the aisle, or an indication he only knows one black Ohio Democrat...
JoyAnnReid	715322221258997760	2016-03-30T23:38:02	And.... Kasich name checks ninaturner! I think he's done this in every debate and town hall so far. msnbctownhall

JoyAnnReid	715320965832581120	2016-03-30T23:33:02	Agreed. He's a much more disciplined communicator and wouldn't have made the "47 percent" or "self deport" gaffes.

JoyAnnReid	715320491809091584	2016-03-30T23:31:09	Completely. 
JoyAnnReid	715320156059250688	2016-03-30T23:29:49	Indeed. 
JoyAnnReid	715320076132597760	2016-03-30T23:29:30	ndarmour heh.
JoyAnnReid	715319996398837764	2016-03-30T23:29:11	I think they do. Kasich is despised by conservatives who equate his "talking to his left" with scolding the right. 
JoyAnnReid	715319703808385026	2016-03-30T23:28:02	...the only way Trump is to the right of the pack is on abortion (now) nukes &amp; open courting of ethno-nationalists. 
JoyAnnReid	715319423817662464	2016-03-30T23:26:55	Not really. On domestic issues (trade, social security, Medicare, even Obamacare) he is to their left. 
JoyAnnReid	715319091691696129	2016-03-30T23:25:36	A good reader for you as you watch the msnbctownhall: "John Kasich is no moderate" slate 
JoyAnnReid	715318586630344704	2016-03-30T23:23:35	Girl, I can't even begin. Again, cue the robot invasion. I'm ready. 
JoyAnnReid	715318437246058496	2016-03-30T23:23:00	I think we in media should self-examine re how much of this presidential election focused on "style" and "authenticity" rather than policy.
JoyAnnReid	715318185352945664	2016-03-30T23:22:00	...though you wouldn't know it from the coverage, which focuses on Kasich as "moderate."  
JoyAnnReid	715317939734454274	2016-03-30T23:21:01	Correct. Kasich (and Ted Cruz, and Scott Walker and Marco Rubio) are about as far right as it gets on abortion.  
JoyAnnReid	715317689749782528	2016-03-30T23:20:01	Unfortunately for Kasich (and Jeb) this was a rough year for moderate-sounding conservatives. The GOP base wants red meat. MSNBCtownhall

JoyAnnReid	715317402658021376	2016-03-30T23:18:53	Bingo. 
JoyAnnReid	715317342255886338	2016-03-30T23:18:39	People also forget that Kasich has media training. He used to host a cable TV show. He's not unskilled at communication. MSNBCtownhall
JoyAnnReid	715317092233388032	2016-03-30T23:17:39	John Kasich's special skill is to come across as a moderate everyman, and to completely obscure how right wing he is. msnbctownhall

JoyAnnReid	715005005435052033	2016-03-30T02:37:32	keyfobz that's very kind, thank you :)
JoyAnnReid	715004873272594437	2016-03-30T02:37:00	@AmKonDotNet I think voters can make their own decisions. Information isn't dangerous. It's just information.
JoyAnnReid	715004536881070080	2016-03-30T02:35:40	None, actually. 2008 was the closest ever. 2nd was 1988 (1st year of proportionality, when Jackson lost by 600 +/-) 
JoyAnnReid	715003306612027392	2016-03-30T02:30:47	Well that's the real problem. By the time we get to June, the incremental ups and downs could WIDEN her lead /or not

JoyAnnReid	715002716179836928	2016-03-30T02:28:26	ageezy3000 mattcorey1121 NomikiKonst @AmKonDotNet correct. Obama was the insurgent. She was supposed to have it locked up from the start.
JoyAnnReid	715002454279122949	2016-03-30T02:27:23	You know what I do support? Math. I really support math. :) 
JoyAnnReid	715002302084620288	2016-03-30T02:26:47	Correct. 
JoyAnnReid	715002171692093443	2016-03-30T02:26:16	Wind2Energy JeffersonObama tcooper9999 joanwalsh well great news for you. I'm sure you're very happy. Doesn't change the math.
JoyAnnReid	715001862597033986	2016-03-30T02:25:02	That's actually not quite true. She lost because he had a 100+ lead in PLEDGED delegates. Supers was just the icing. 
JoyAnnReid	715001551199334400	2016-03-30T02:23:48	Correct. 
JoyAnnReid	715001424002826240	2016-03-30T02:23:18	Then Barack Obama would not have been the Democratic nominee in 2008. 
JoyAnnReid	715001312820199427	2016-03-30T02:22:51	Sure. If he wins CA 60-40% he will get 285 of those delegates. If that happens it will be a major, top story. 
JoyAnnReid	715000978198700032	2016-03-30T02:21:31	Oh no, I'm waiting with popcorn at the ready for you to share the TRUTH! BTW have we ever even met? No? Ok DO go on. 
JoyAnnReid	715000652485816323	2016-03-30T02:20:14	Correct. It started decisively with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, whose districts Obama won 3-1. 
JoyAnnReid	715000541106061312	2016-03-30T02:19:47	I'm thinking Republican leaders wish they had some superdelegates right about now... 
JoyAnnReid	715000429013311488	2016-03-30T02:19:20	.fuckvogel ShaunGains oh do tell. Since you apparently know what's deep inside the recesses of my mind...
JoyAnnReid	715000257977909248	2016-03-30T02:18:40	respect4all I'm not sure I even understand the line of argument, frankly.
JoyAnnReid	715000171575250944	2016-03-30T02:18:19	The notion that Sanders didn't compete in states like Florida is easily disproven by any reporter who was there. 
JoyAnnReid	714999918847516673	2016-03-30T02:17:19	.theyoooooshow and remember, HRC didn't explicitly run on making history as a woman, until the very end of the race, when it was too late.
JoyAnnReid	714999803760001025	2016-03-30T02:16:51	Many supers, particularly black electeds, felt they could not resist that tide of history.  
JoyAnnReid	714999655575207937	2016-03-30T02:16:16	Well in 2008, he had an insurmountable lead in pledged delegates, plus the tug of history, particularly for POC. 
JoyAnnReid	714999327563849730	2016-03-30T02:14:58	.williams1977 politics can make you seriously disillusioned when the minutiae and rules bog down your sense of excitement and hope.
JoyAnnReid	714999182248042496	2016-03-30T02:14:23	.williams1977 I'm more than happy to do it. I'm glad people are getting involved, and get that some are unfamiliar with the process.
JoyAnnReid	714998858414178304	2016-03-30T02:13:06	BTW it's not to say it can't be done. The Clinton team has been felled by overconfidence before (hello, Michigan!)  
JoyAnnReid	714998681129365504	2016-03-30T02:12:24	Well herein lies the tough sledding for Sanders. He needs to win most of those states, in landslide fashion. 
JoyAnnReid	714998492264062977	2016-03-30T02:11:39	I can only tell you they aren't actually changing the trajectory of the race. Hope that's somewhat helpful. :) 
JoyAnnReid	714998194179072000	2016-03-30T02:10:28	And I see your point, truly. But SDs are simply expressing their personal preference &amp; support, just like voters do. 
JoyAnnReid	714997989786394624	2016-03-30T02:09:39	But even if he'd gotten all of the supers from CO it wouldn't cut into Clinton's lead enough to change anything. 
JoyAnnReid	714997509668601856	2016-03-30T02:07:44	If Sanders overtakes Clinton in pledged delegates, superdelegates will vote for him, bc he will be the nominee. 
JoyAnnReid	714997354026369024	2016-03-30T02:07:07	Also, the supers don't actually count until the convention, where they show up, and vote for whoever is the nominee. 
JoyAnnReid	714997103836180480	2016-03-30T02:06:08	No. Without them, she'd still be ahead by a prohibitive margin (1243 to 975, vs 1712 to 1004). 
JoyAnnReid	714996586170990593	2016-03-30T02:04:04	Best ad line in decades. 
JoyAnnReid	714996490448551937	2016-03-30T02:03:41	Y'all do know that wanting something to happen and it being the "only right and fair thing" to have happen are two different things, right?
JoyAnnReid	714996284478849025	2016-03-30T02:02:52	JETBallin thank you :)
JoyAnnReid	714996229181145088	2016-03-30T02:02:39	Then you think Sanders should get no superdelegates out of South Carolina, or Ohio, for example? 
JoyAnnReid	714996042870235136	2016-03-30T02:01:55	OmanReagan donaltc Only4RM NailzConnelly that's not how any of this works.
JoyAnnReid	714995996808323072	2016-03-30T02:01:44	So they should take undemocratic action to award the nomination to the person who didn't win, because you prefer it? 
JoyAnnReid	714995740788060161	2016-03-30T02:00:43	Only if what you want from media is that they take proactive steps to make your preferred candidate the frontrunner. 
JoyAnnReid	714995499456204800	2016-03-30T01:59:45	donaltc edixon1213 ShaunKing BTW the methodology on my chart was to award all superdels from each state to the winner of its prim/cauc.

JoyAnnReid	714988749881544705	2016-03-30T01:32:56	Correct. It's an honorific that comes automatically with getting elected to a political or party position. 
JoyAnnReid	714988515323482112	2016-03-30T01:32:00	Polls don't back up your assertion. Dems consistently report satisfaction with with either nominee. 
JoyAnnReid	714987994751565825	2016-03-30T01:29:56	...one of the inventors of the superdelegate system was Sen. Sanders' chief strategist Tad Devine. 2/2

JoyAnnReid	714986219852144640	2016-03-30T01:22:53	Correct. And this despite her lead in the popular vote.  
JoyAnnReid	714986022078128128	2016-03-30T01:22:06	There are a number of sites posting the pledged delegates by state. Clinton is ahead in every count.  
JoyAnnReid	714985837251981312	2016-03-30T01:21:22	Not sure how you'd get that calculation. He has won 15 states vs Clinton's 20, and the latter are larger/more dels.

JoyAnnReid	714940820911165440	2016-03-29T22:22:29	Hell, the "founders" would be appalled at like 70 percent of us (women, black people, non-land-owners) voting at all!
JoyAnnReid	714940397663952896	2016-03-29T22:20:48	Binding popular primaries and caucuses are a very recent thing. The Founders are a poor groip to go to in search of "fairness" in elections.
JoyAnnReid	714940010714251264	2016-03-29T22:19:16	...and state party conventions, then as now, were really just to select delegates to the national convention, where party bosses still chose
JoyAnnReid	714939811459702784	2016-03-29T22:18:28	Even after the addition of "beauty contest" primaries in maybe a dozen states in the early 1900s, they weren't binding at all...
JoyAnnReid	714939599030759426	2016-03-29T22:17:38	From around the 1840s, state party conventions did, but those were run by party bosses who decided who participated and who got nominated.
JoyAnnReid	714939411469889540	2016-03-29T22:16:53	Re tying "fairness" to the Founders, for the first 65 years or so in the U.S., party caucuses in congress picked the party nominees.
JoyAnnReid	714936414006325249	2016-03-29T22:04:58	The founders didn't anticipate polling, or primaries. Small groups of grandees picked the nominees until the 1960s.

JoyAnnReid	714908825845899264	2016-03-29T20:15:21	donaltc I did the calculation earlier today. It wouldn't change the margin at all. 
JoyAnnReid	714908613928742917	2016-03-29T20:14:30	.Rubyguggenheim Mathemagicianme sure. And if he wins every state, esp big states, from here on in by lopsided margins, that could change.
JoyAnnReid	714908423700217857	2016-03-29T20:13:45	.Sekhmara the challenge for Sanders is that even if supers did go along with him in states he won, he'd still be behind by more than 380.
JoyAnnReid	714908079909953536	2016-03-29T20:12:23	That did indeed happen, particularly after he won SC, and amid huge, lopsided Obama margins in their cong districts. 
JoyAnnReid	714907518913417217	2016-03-29T20:10:09	SoulCodesMSW if you think that tweet is divisive, I don't know what to tell you. Twitter is going to be a tough neighborhood for you.

JoyAnnReid	714906779533119489	2016-03-29T20:07:13	True. And they have become a symbolic, emotional issue this cycle, of establishment vs outsider campaigns. 
JoyAnnReid	714906254880190466	2016-03-29T20:05:08	That's true. But some Sanders supporters believe that's not the case and that superdelegates are skewing the numbers 
JoyAnnReid	714905947496398848	2016-03-29T20:03:54	sharecropperson Chy_369 well maybe you should join the field and show us how it's done?
JoyAnnReid	714905816533438464	2016-03-29T20:03:23	Candidates who aren't polling at viability don't get coverage. There are probably 22 people running besides her btw. 
JoyAnnReid	714905615806672898	2016-03-29T20:02:35	The bottom line is superdelegates are literally having no impact on the trajectory of the Democratic campaign. 
JoyAnnReid	714905506129780739	2016-03-29T20:02:09	Indeed. The issues are the number of states won by each candidate (20 HRC vs 15 BS), and the relative state sizes.

JoyAnnReid	714904567427809280	2016-03-29T19:58:25	I think journalists have tried to point out when campaigns are lying. To what campaigns and lies are you referring? 
JoyAnnReid	714904389606096896	2016-03-29T19:57:43	It's a thought experiment based on the fact that Sanders supporters are calling on supers to vote as their state did

JoyAnnReid	714301132781256704	2016-03-28T04:00:35	In my neighborhood, we achieved that by pouring the Kool-Aid mom bought into baggies and sneaking them into class :)

JoyAnnReid	714297394591088644	2016-03-28T03:45:44	Surprised no one has mentioned Mountain Dew, which I'm pretty sure is the reanimating fluid Dr. Frankenstein used.
JoyAnnReid	714297156484653056	2016-03-28T03:44:47	Jolt got me through college freshman year. :)

JoyAnnReid	714295795202306049	2016-03-28T03:39:23	This is absolutely true. 
JoyAnnReid	714295752210714625	2016-03-28T03:39:12	Oh wow, you really reached back into the crates!  
JoyAnnReid	714295663777955841	2016-03-28T03:38:51	LoriDeeCee it just makes a body weary at a certain point :)

JoyAnnReid	714295000104828929	2016-03-28T03:36:13	We haven't even mentioned root beer! A&amp;W used to have an entire restaurant in Denver, with root beer on tap :)
JoyAnnReid	714294734928347136	2016-03-28T03:35:10	No, hadn't heard of that one!  
JoyAnnReid	714294667655950336	2016-03-28T03:34:54	Is it me, or does orange soda taste exactly like regular orange soda? 
JoyAnnReid	714294530439311364	2016-03-28T03:34:21	Yeah, changing the name just seems silly. Maybe they wanted to make it seem less stodgy?  
JoyAnnReid	714294367398273024	2016-03-28T03:33:42	OMG Pepsi Free! Like "New Coke" -- an example of epic corporate malfeasance. 
JoyAnnReid	714294165010575361	2016-03-28T03:32:54	Well it is a grain ... yes, I think we can survive on that. 
JoyAnnReid	714294037138841601	2016-03-28T03:32:24	Which best describes your memories of TaB?
JoyAnnReid	714293294344376320	2016-03-28T03:29:26	Amazing how something as simple as soda (which will always be "pop" to me) evokes so many childhood memories :) 
JoyAnnReid	714293131668287489	2016-03-28T03:28:48	Fresca is actually really good. Better than Sprite :) 
JoyAnnReid	714292965464739840	2016-03-28T03:28:08	Madness. Even sitting near a can of that stuff is all kinds of wrong. 
JoyAnnReid	714292759557963776	2016-03-28T03:27:19	GRASSGURU I'm not even sure it was sugar! I think it was saccharin!
JoyAnnReid	714292646022406144	2016-03-28T03:26:52	Perfect description. Blech. 
JoyAnnReid	714292593320935424	2016-03-28T03:26:39	They did indeed. That's how they achieved brand dominance.

JoyAnnReid	714291601619685376	2016-03-28T03:22:43	Egads... 
JoyAnnReid	714291454856847364	2016-03-28T03:22:08	It was consistently ranked the best tasting Cola. But couldn't compete with Coke and Pepsi's economies of scale. 
JoyAnnReid	714291267266600960	2016-03-28T03:21:23	Didn't know that!

JoyAnnReid	714290804668375040	2016-03-28T03:19:33	OMG Mellow Yellow! Grapefruit soda. Who comes up with grapefruit soda??? 
JoyAnnReid	714290701035577345	2016-03-28T03:19:08	Ah, jingles!  
JoyAnnReid	714290641384128516	2016-03-28T03:18:54	Mr. Pibb! That's still served in some fast food joints. It's like lowbrow Dr. Pepper :) 
JoyAnnReid	714290524858028032	2016-03-28T03:18:26	My babysitter used to drink the stuff and let my sister and I give it a try. As vile a brew as there ever was.

JoyAnnReid	714288596753256448	2016-03-28T03:10:46	It used to regularly win taste tests &amp; is nearly as old as Coca-Cola! (I once worked for a beverage consultancy) :)

JoyAnnReid	714151300498370561	2016-03-27T18:05:12	BeachPeanuts it's a demand for a 24/7 infomercial. Anything less is a counterrevolutionary conspiracy.
JoyAnnReid	714150969358032897	2016-03-27T18:03:54	That this was even a question is stunning.

JoyAnnReid	714147895054843904	2016-03-27T17:51:41	Only4RM exactly. People don't want coverage-they want the media to join and promote their cause. To do otherwise is to "forsake journallsm"
JoyAnnReid	714147459539271680	2016-03-27T17:49:57	brandi_e_hudson unless we run a 24/7 infomercial about how awesome their candidate is and why people must vote for him? Nope.
JoyAnnReid	714146347654447105	2016-03-27T17:45:32	We did cover it. I did so personally. chrislhayes interviewed the recorder who was responsible for it. 
JoyAnnReid	714145969479294976	2016-03-27T17:44:01	I did TV all day between hosting and guesting, from 10am to 7:30 pm. We covered the caucuses all day, then til 9pm.

JoyAnnReid	714141161368199168	2016-03-27T17:24:55	Based on how people click and watch anything about him... Sadly this seems to be at least partly the case.  
JoyAnnReid	714137608390066177	2016-03-27T17:10:48	Indeed.  
JoyAnnReid	714137491687751680	2016-03-27T17:10:20	Dang. 
JoyAnnReid	714137330374807552	2016-03-27T17:09:42	BTW, here are the various candidates' sunday show exposure to date: 
JoyAnnReid	714136130933927936	2016-03-27T17:04:56	I mean really, what other candidate would have an entire news cycle dedicated to a bird landing on their podium?
JoyAnnReid	714135907746648064	2016-03-27T17:04:03	Once Sanders started looking more viable he got more coverage. And unlike Clinton's, it was almost all positive: 
JoyAnnReid	714135565650804736	2016-03-27T17:02:41	The political media places embeds with every campaign. But the airtime goes to the frontrunners.
JoyAnnReid	714135373434249216	2016-03-27T17:01:55	.aravosis you could argue Rubio got more coverage than he was due - but it was because media people (though I disagreed) thot he could win.
JoyAnnReid	714135116067553280	2016-03-27T17:00:54	.aravosis highly unlikely to win. Martin O'Malley got even less coverage, for the same reason. On the R side, ditto Ben Carson, Jindal etc.
JoyAnnReid	714134883040362496	2016-03-27T16:59:58	.aravosis Trump got lots of coverage immediately because he is a human TV show: he rates. Sanders didn't initially bc he was seen as ...
JoyAnnReid	714134528625926145	2016-03-27T16:58:34	I would argue both are phenomena, and in some ways two sides of the same one: working class disillunsionment. 
JoyAnnReid	714133118161170436	2016-03-27T16:52:57	That said, the idea that there's some media conspiracy to not cover the Sanders weekend caucus results is ridiculous. Sorry, just is.
JoyAnnReid	714132559240818688	2016-03-27T16:50:44	..to NickKristof's point, we don't cover things like economic and racial/ethnic anxiety nearly enough, or bluntly enough.
JoyAnnReid	714132250351288321	2016-03-27T16:49:31	I personally never found him "entertaining" but that was certainly a narrative. People were surprised by his durability in part because 1/2
JoyAnnReid	714131991080407041	2016-03-27T16:48:29	BTW I think NickKristof made some really important points in his nytimes column about particularly the early media reaction to Trump.
JoyAnnReid	714131135056449537	2016-03-27T16:45:05	BillNeelyNBC :-) thanks!

JoyAnnReid	714130972254593024	2016-03-27T16:44:26	Then another round of election coverage that I believe ran til 9pm.  
JoyAnnReid	714130702221119488	2016-03-27T16:43:21	Rather than go to Lockup as usual, we had special election coverage from 5 til 7:30 (extended to run the speech)... 
JoyAnnReid	714130103496806400	2016-03-27T16:40:59	BTW major, major kudos to BillNeelyNBC for your coverage and analysis on Brussels today. I'm now an even bigger fan of your work.
JoyAnnReid	714129774323638273	2016-03-27T16:39:40	Where has our collective sense of proportionality gone?
JoyAnnReid	714128980895539204	2016-03-27T16:36:31	But again, that's not how it works. You want a 24 hour infomercial. Media covers results when they come in. 
JoyAnnReid	714128722463469568	2016-03-27T16:35:29	Correct. Kornacki picked it up from Ari at 7:30pm. And again, the results in 2 of 3 were in by 7pm or even earlier. 
JoyAnnReid	714128310469574659	2016-03-27T16:33:51	Why would he go on after midnight? We do that during weeknights when polls close late atnight. 1st closings were 1pm 
JoyAnnReid	714127486070685696	2016-03-27T16:30:35	We were on even past the planned terminal break. Left the set at 7:30 pm ET. Lockup normally starts at 5. 
JoyAnnReid	714127210672758784	2016-03-27T16:29:29	Thank you Lisa!! Much love to you sis üòä 
JoyAnnReid	714126760078610432	2016-03-27T16:27:42	Will keep following up on this, and the civic and economic consequences. 
JoyAnnReid	714126580583428096	2016-03-27T16:26:59	False. And I know because I was sitting on set with AriMelber when the results came in, and we broadcast for hours.

JoyAnnReid	714085449602564096	2016-03-27T13:43:32	Per ChrisJansing the peaceful group are now holding the square, as Belgian police calmly move the right wing group away.
JoyAnnReid	714085057737175040	2016-03-27T13:41:59	Riot police briefly used water canons to push back the far right group and separate them from the peaceful group.

JoyAnnReid	712981941507788800	2016-03-24T12:38:36	Another great point, although I don't think many DC Republicans see government shutdown Cruz as a team player. 
JoyAnnReid	712981485888868357	2016-03-24T12:36:47	Firestorm is a good term for it. 
JoyAnnReid	712981034409848832	2016-03-24T12:34:59	Yep the theory has serious flaws; mainly, the notion that the elites can simply resume their former role unscathed. 
JoyAnnReid	712980084475490305	2016-03-24T12:31:13	.DemFromCT StuPolitics there's definitely an argument that Cruz offers a different but equally potent comeuppance for the GOP.
JoyAnnReid	712979844972339200	2016-03-24T12:30:16	Being of "the no compromise, anti-establishment wing" Cruz="the clear choice ...conservatives claim they never had."

JoyAnnReid	712976815493685250	2016-03-24T12:18:13	Yep. Sure is. 
JoyAnnReid	712976583011786753	2016-03-24T12:17:18	Or this. 
JoyAnnReid	712976488447000577	2016-03-24T12:16:55	The hope being that once the rebels defeat the "the rabble" and are themselves defeated, the monarchs can rule anew.

JoyAnnReid	712056314550198272	2016-03-21T23:20:29	Trump's speech was a full pander. Cruz is basically calling for utterly breaking the Palestinian people &amp; killing any notion of sovereignty.

JoyAnnReid	711947318094913536	2016-03-21T16:07:22	RGC_BPPA interesting and creative reading of my post. But ok you do you.
JoyAnnReid	711947152457601024	2016-03-21T16:06:43	The saturation coverage of Trump has allowed his opponents to go largely unexamined. Case in point: 
JoyAnnReid	711946234756472833	2016-03-21T16:03:04	The upshot from Brownstein: Trump isn't bringing in new voters, he's turning out more blue collar white Republicans: 
JoyAnnReid	711945892446732289	2016-03-21T16:01:42	Thanks! Just re-read it and yes, it's a must-read from the brilliant RonBrownstein -  
JoyAnnReid	711943023475695616	2016-03-21T15:50:18	Sanders handily wins Democrats abroad primary, 69-31.  - campaign says it will net 9 of 13 delegates at stake.
JoyAnnReid	711933237132705792	2016-03-21T15:11:25	Yes. Will find and post!  
JoyAnnReid	711933136821682177	2016-03-21T15:11:01	Valid point.  
JoyAnnReid	711933002381709312	2016-03-21T15:10:29	The irony is that as ridiculed as it is now, the RNC's GOP autopsy of 2012 was, from a demographic trendline POV, correct.
JoyAnnReid	711932728611102720	2016-03-21T15:09:24	tomwatson guardian thanks Tom!
JoyAnnReid	711932692896595968	2016-03-21T15:09:15	The upshot being that there are simply not enough white working class voters in the current US population for the VWVT to be true.
JoyAnnReid	711932355049623555	2016-03-21T15:07:55	I've raised this theory with our GOP pollster at work and firmly refuted it, as Tuxeira has (and Ron Brownstein too).
JoyAnnReid	711932168822464512	2016-03-21T15:07:10	... and that activating these millions is a surer route to Republican victory than making inroads with nonwhite voters.
JoyAnnReid	711932010026156032	2016-03-21T15:06:32	The "vanishing white voter" theory is a belief by some on the right that McCain, Romney only lost be millions of white voters stayed home...
JoyAnnReid	711931735735283712	2016-03-21T15:05:27	Another firm, data-based refutation of the "vanishing white voter" theory (explained in the next tweet.) 
JoyAnnReid	711912471825682434	2016-03-21T13:48:54	My first-ever piece for the guardian - 
JoyAnnReid	711909465461809153	2016-03-21T13:36:57	Indeed, it's a jarring but instructive blast of sunlight, illuminating what's been hiding in dark places all along.  
JoyAnnReid	711908456408682496	2016-03-21T13:32:57	Wonderful. And happy birthday to you :) 
JoyAnnReid	711908142033051649	2016-03-21T13:31:42	Another "no" to the GOP establishment's capitulation to Trump. Question is how large the NeverTrump movement is. 
JoyAnnReid	711906535702712320	2016-03-21T13:25:19	Said at AIPAC this morning. toughlove from the veep  
JoyAnnReid	711904129480843264	2016-03-21T13:15:45	Wow! Gorgeous :) 
JoyAnnReid	711904014523183108	2016-03-21T13:15:18	.sgw94 I hear ya and agree that the details don't seem to matter. They trust in the power of Trump's "outsider" persona to see it done.
JoyAnnReid	711903732791943168	2016-03-21T13:14:11	And based on listening to some of them in radio call ins, many of them have a neg. fixation with blacklivesmatter 
JoyAnnReid	711902972523974656	2016-03-21T13:11:09	...and enacting crippling tariffs to allegedly "stop" China from "beating us."  
JoyAnnReid	711902799920021504	2016-03-21T13:10:28	Don't know about that. They seem to *really* care about building a wall across the Mexican border, barring Muslims..
