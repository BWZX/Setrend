DraperRobert	689242148957474816	2016-01-19T00:25:08	Alean4 true, and I wouldn't expect Penn to be an advocate for journalists. But the story is so supine, so smug--and yes, so blind.
DraperRobert	689241138247680000	2016-01-19T00:21:07	dcbigjohn well, that too. shots
DraperRobert	689240917023264768	2016-01-19T00:20:14	And then to snivel about how the media mis-reports on this subject. We're far from perfect, but reading Penn, I'm not fearing for my job.
DraperRobert	689240655734935552	2016-01-19T00:19:12	Alean4 Again to be fair the subject is interesting &amp; the degree of difficulty in getting it was formidable. Mainly though I felt duty-bound
DraperRobert	689240415212548097	2016-01-19T00:18:15	I mean, you can have a very legit argument about the war on drugs w/o casting Chapo as a swashbuckling, nonviolent mogul.
DraperRobert	689240137570607104	2016-01-19T00:17:08	I should add to be fair: getting to Chapo was a dramatic trek. But Penn amps up his &amp; Kate's heroics. I'm embarrassed for RS, again.
DraperRobert	689239311141724161	2016-01-19T00:13:51	4/4 Most of all it's RS advocacy journalism yet again. Chapo is pretty much lionized, and the villain--the only one--is the war on drugs.
DraperRobert	689239144191672320	2016-01-19T00:13:12	3/4 The interview is deeply disappointing. Penn's questions are worse than a high school paper, by a country mile.
DraperRobert	689238934208008196	2016-01-19T00:12:22	2/4 I would've hated to have been Penn's editor. It's so overwrought; you can tell the purple prose was published w/the editor's hands tied.
DraperRobert	689238565818134528	2016-01-19T00:10:54	So I've now read in it entirety Sean Penn's Rolling Stone story about El Chapo. A few thoughts, beginning with: 1/4
