MattBruenig	725199465666207744	2016-04-27T05:46:40	nberlat thitchner cosmohouck your using that phrase different than the way I mean it
MattBruenig	725199126124740609	2016-04-27T05:45:19	thitchner nberlat cosmohouck and people do operationalize cultural capital, seen them do it in UK
MattBruenig	725198996667510784	2016-04-27T05:44:49	thitchner nberlat cosmohouck cultural capital is really the important concept here
MattBruenig	725198609470394368	2016-04-27T05:43:16	nberlat thitchner cosmohouck not really, I bring up my poorness only in a defensive posture when someone's trying to tell me I can't talk
MattBruenig	725198276681687041	2016-04-27T05:41:57	nberlat thitchner cosmohouck one exception to this is athletes, which are an interesting case precisely for that reason
MattBruenig	725198091805163520	2016-04-27T05:41:13	nberlat thitchner cosmohouck the things you have to do to make it require a total alienation from you past self, you are a new person
MattBruenig	725197984414220288	2016-04-27T05:40:47	nberlat thitchner cosmohouck but the tragic reality of mobility is that aren't a "poor person who made it"
MattBruenig	725197733578084353	2016-04-27T05:39:47	nberlat thitchner cosmohouck i bring up that I was poor to defend my ability to defer to no one on issues of class
MattBruenig	725197296523173888	2016-04-27T05:38:03	nberlat thitchner cosmohouck I don't possess both modes and code-switch between. The old mode was destroyed entirely.
MattBruenig	725197186301042689	2016-04-27T05:37:37	nberlat thitchner cosmohouck "double consciousness" refers to possessing the two modes *at the same time*
MattBruenig	725196865579417600	2016-04-27T05:36:20	thitchner nberlat cosmohouck it is brought up in the context of race often but if you interrogate those cases, it's about class
MattBruenig	725196740241035264	2016-04-27T05:35:51	nberlat thitchner cosmohouck he never stopped being black
MattBruenig	725196454655066112	2016-04-27T05:34:42	nberlat thitchner cosmohouck If I had actually remained lower class, I could not do this. I am someone who had childhood experiences only
MattBruenig	725196114450878464	2016-04-27T05:33:21	nberlat thitchner cosmohouck yes but notice I had to become totally unrecognizable to my prior self to do what I now do
MattBruenig	725195656017629184	2016-04-27T05:31:32	nberlat thitchner cosmohouck the nature of poverty is that you are not in a position, educationally or otherwise, to do that work
MattBruenig	725195542201012228	2016-04-27T05:31:05	nberlat thitchner cosmohouck The truly best insights on class have rarely if ever come from the poor, that's just reality.
MattBruenig	725195353591549952	2016-04-27T05:30:20	nberlat thitchner cosmohouck Once more, not to be too jokey here, but the near total elision of class drives a lot of this reasoning.
MattBruenig	725195061990936576	2016-04-27T05:29:10	nberlat thitchner cosmohouck critiques can come from anywhere, factory owner engels was very sharp on capitalist issues
MattBruenig	725194624667541504	2016-04-27T05:27:26	thitchner cosmohouck nberlat but ultimately the point gestures towards independent verification of the lead not deference
MattBruenig	725194279434477568	2016-04-27T05:26:04	thitchner cosmohouck nberlat yes this is an actually good point, which is about the discovery of leads into new things
MattBruenig	725193814042877952	2016-04-27T05:24:13	nberlat i read the whole gamut of critiques from far right to shit lib, like I say in the other tweet, that's my whole job
MattBruenig	725193454788173824	2016-04-27T05:22:47	nberlat i listen to people all the time, my whole job is to read people i disagree with on my economic views
MattBruenig	725192879921070080	2016-04-27T05:20:30	nberlat I am quite specific about my views and how I think they work, it's all accessible to public reason and critique
MattBruenig	725192596910424064	2016-04-27T05:19:23	nberlat what if your community is deeply wrong
MattBruenig	725192081300426752	2016-04-27T05:17:20	nberlat Like if I had to create a model to predict Noah's Opinion, the only variable would be "whatever the lib circle he runs in thinks"
MattBruenig	725191867084754944	2016-04-27T05:16:29	nberlat Your actual theory seems to be "whatever my niche lib in-group is sort of feeling is good and bad right now"
MattBruenig	725191329916006400	2016-04-27T05:14:21	nberlat I want you to articulate a concrete theory that can be applied in real life to reach clear conclusions about views/conduct.
MattBruenig	725191128568483841	2016-04-27T05:13:33	nberlat yes
MattBruenig	725190729828564992	2016-04-27T05:11:58	nberlat What you like to do is speak vaguely around a topic to allow you maximum flexibility to do whatever you want in any given case.
MattBruenig	725190562719080448	2016-04-27T05:11:18	nberlat I am a fan of clarity.
MattBruenig	725190371320410113	2016-04-27T05:10:32	Cait_ing For instance when a white person says race doesn't matter, I don't take that very seriously. They are white after all.
MattBruenig	725190270430679040	2016-04-27T05:10:08	Cait_ing Wouldn't you agree that it's OK to disregard people with X privilege when they are downplaying the importance of X?
MattBruenig	725189678278807552	2016-04-27T05:07:47	nberlat so again, a conservative black makes an arg against affirmative action -- tell me what I can say in response? (I support AA)
MattBruenig	725189529343238144	2016-04-27T05:07:11	nberlat If you can dismiss someone's identity-based claims by referencing empirical facts, then what is left of the framework?
MattBruenig	725189367057272837	2016-04-27T05:06:33	nberlat Don't get me wrong, I know the answer is "do that when they aren't adhering to the current woke lib orthodoxy" but it's interesting
MattBruenig	725189146533335040	2016-04-27T05:05:40	nberlat You just said it was OK to do that. Is it or is it not?
MattBruenig	725189073971892224	2016-04-27T05:05:23	nberlat You see the problem here right? The second you say I can dismiss them because they are wrong, the entire edifice collapses.
MattBruenig	725188861651996672	2016-04-27T05:04:32	nberlat Wait. So I can use statistics to say a POC is wrong about their own experience or that that experience is not generalizable?
MattBruenig	725188558550605825	2016-04-27T05:03:20	Cait_ing I've had enough people richsplain to me how inequality and class aren't that big a deal, I don't need anymore!
MattBruenig	725188404879695872	2016-04-27T05:02:43	Cait_ing i disregard the opinions of all people with class privilege when it comes to topics of class, as am I supposed to
MattBruenig	725188236356767744	2016-04-27T05:02:03	One thing I've noticed is people are loathe to discuss their class background. Some privs are less important than others it seems.
MattBruenig	725187966193270784	2016-04-27T05:00:59	nberlat So what do you, a white man, say?
MattBruenig	725187912556535808	2016-04-27T05:00:46	nberlat How do you deal with this person in the framework? They have the experience. They want you to stop hurting them as they see it.
MattBruenig	725187668192165889	2016-04-27T04:59:48	nberlat e.g. when a conservative black person says they oppose affirmative action because they "know" what it does to sow doubt, then what?
MattBruenig	725187413228851200	2016-04-27T04:58:47	nberlat To dismiss someone of a qualified identity *because* of their substantive views is to undermine the entire premise of the approach.
MattBruenig	725187160412921857	2016-04-27T04:57:47	nberlat It says that being of a particular identity makes you expert in topics related to it, meaning you should be deferred to.
MattBruenig	725186986470969344	2016-04-27T04:57:05	nberlat The identitarian framework is premised upon deference to people *based on their identity* rather than their substantive views.
MattBruenig	725186800273219584	2016-04-27T04:56:21	nberlat I am baffled as to what this tweet even means.
MattBruenig	725186490607738880	2016-04-27T04:55:07	Cait_ing Did you grow up in poverty or in the lower class more generally?
MattBruenig	725186326648213504	2016-04-27T04:54:28	Cait_ing I believe identity matters when it comes to politics, I know not everyone agrees with me on that, but so it goes
MattBruenig	725185661234479104	2016-04-27T04:51:49	FarmerHayek nberlat So it turns out in practice that the only voices they defer to are the ones they substantively agree with
MattBruenig	725185503528636417	2016-04-27T04:51:11	FarmerHayek nberlat Conservative women have internalized misogyny. Conservative blacks have internalized racism. etc
MattBruenig	725185322557005824	2016-04-27T04:50:28	FarmerHayek nberlat And when people of identities they do defer to say things they don't like, they pathologize them
MattBruenig	725185169775288320	2016-04-27T04:49:52	FarmerHayek nberlat (well the unimportance of it)
MattBruenig	725185097662664705	2016-04-27T04:49:35	FarmerHayek nberlat This political formation is very comfortable with class privileged ppl opining on the importance of class politics
MattBruenig	725184895966924801	2016-04-27T04:48:47	FarmerHayek nberlat the more biting criticism here is that these identity-based principles are not actually followed in any consistent way
MattBruenig	725182869438652416	2016-04-27T04:40:43	michaelcald_ what do you mean

MattBruenig	725182461236367360	2016-04-27T04:39:06	asymptosis Put those revenues in sovereign wealth funds such as in Alaska and Norway and socialize ownership over time that way.
MattBruenig	725182256663396352	2016-04-27T04:38:17	asymptosis The state can hoover up capital assets through wealth taxes, inheritance taxes, and other financial engineering.

MattBruenig	725128925693788161	2016-04-27T01:06:22	this is exactly what we predicted 
MattBruenig	725106746793070592	2016-04-26T23:38:14	wow anti-american much? 
MattBruenig	725001653833846784	2016-04-26T16:40:38	yeselson inclusionist ryanlcooper That is what the claim has to be here
MattBruenig	725001611223961600	2016-04-26T16:40:28	yeselson inclusionist ryanlcooper Like they are willing to consciously forego $240k in lifetime income because Medicare too big a gamble
MattBruenig	725001522283745280	2016-04-26T16:40:07	yeselson inclusionist ryanlcooper Let's just be clear: People are willing to "pay" $6k/yr to avoid govt HC because worried it won't work
MattBruenig	725001108146511872	2016-04-26T16:38:28	thitchner yeselson inclusionist ryanlcooper Then I will believe people are really deadset against tax-funded medicare
MattBruenig	725001027217444868	2016-04-26T16:38:09	thitchner yeselson inclusionist ryanlcooper get someone to say "I am willing to lose a $240k in lifetime income to stop Medicare"
MattBruenig	725000817162489856	2016-04-26T16:37:19	thitchner yeselson inclusionist ryanlcooper but I'm saying that until this is expressed clearly I don't believe voters don't want it
MattBruenig	724998878966255616	2016-04-26T16:29:37	thitchner yeselson inclusionist ryanlcooper If they then answered "I am willing to pay $6k to stop it," it would prove we can't have it.
MattBruenig	724998786649604097	2016-04-26T16:29:15	thitchner yeselson inclusionist ryanlcooper Would be interested in Q: how much money are you willing to pay to stop universal healthcare
MattBruenig	724998299313410048	2016-04-26T16:27:19	thitchner yeselson inclusionist ryanlcooper The question asked was incoherent. I interpret as them willing to give up $1k in disp income
MattBruenig	724997549472501760	2016-04-26T16:24:20	yeselson inclusionist ryanlcooper These people are willing to pay $1k, which is $7k more than they need to!
MattBruenig	724997470497988608	2016-04-26T16:24:01	yeselson inclusionist ryanlcooper If universal health care saves you $10k in expenditure for $4k in cash, then amount you paid is -$6k.
MattBruenig	724996836608462848	2016-04-26T16:21:30	yeselson inclusionist ryanlcooper Those polls show people are apparently willing to give up more than is even needed for the proposals
MattBruenig	724994865252147200	2016-04-26T16:13:40	yeselson ryanlcooper chrislhayes his actual proposals are something like 7 points of GDP
MattBruenig	724994442185347072	2016-04-26T16:11:59	yeselson DavidKaib ryanlcooper chrislhayes the majority of people would have more disposable income under a tax-and-dividend plan
MattBruenig	724994148005208064	2016-04-26T16:10:49	ICUDrEd chrislhayes ryanlcooper right, cities are not a great political subdivision from which to draw funding for schools
MattBruenig	724992791173029888	2016-04-26T16:05:25	yeselson ryanlcooper chrislhayes bernie's proposed tax level is quite modest relative to the nordics
MattBruenig	724991936671682560	2016-04-26T16:02:02	chrislhayes ryanlcooper Right. They do both. Though the US has much more room to soak the rich because of very high earnings disparity
MattBruenig	724991223736504320	2016-04-26T15:59:12	ryanlcooper chrislhayes people seem unable to fathom the level of income taxing going on there 
MattBruenig	724989661475692544	2016-04-26T15:52:59	ryanlcooper the progressivity debate is a tired one, i hoped this would be my last word 
MattBruenig	724988304437956608	2016-04-26T15:47:36	ryanlcooper they soak the hell out of them
MattBruenig	724987523143970816	2016-04-26T15:44:29	I am sure a sugar tax would work at some level, though 30% may not be enough.
MattBruenig	724985670335401985	2016-04-26T15:37:08	Finland has a sugar tax though it didn't seem to work and then later there were EU complications with it

MattBruenig	724947226078941186	2016-04-26T13:04:22	jbouie point is i think libs would be for it and cons less so, just like cons always talking about troops undercompensated

MattBruenig	724789317260955648	2016-04-26T02:36:53	nberlat Is there a need for that? Whatever your answer here is also my answer to your question.
MattBruenig	724789195429007360	2016-04-26T02:36:24	nberlat What if a twitterer's race is not knowable from their bio. They dismiss racial issues. I search and find a pic of them being white.
MattBruenig	724788063369613312	2016-04-26T02:31:54	nberlat it seems relevant when they are dismissing class issues
MattBruenig	724787862823157760	2016-04-26T02:31:07	nberlat I mean poor people are ideologically diverse and hold every view under the sun about policies. Same is true of all groups.
MattBruenig	724786865614774274	2016-04-26T02:27:09	nberlat and then calling someone out on their class priv is seen as doxing because class is less obvious
MattBruenig	724786692381630464	2016-04-26T02:26:28	nberlat anyways, this is beside the point, surely class priv should be checked on same par as other priv, but it isn't
MattBruenig	724786370254884864	2016-04-26T02:25:11	nberlat None of them run in lib circles though. One runs in no circles. The other two in far left circles.
MattBruenig	724786275425898496	2016-04-26T02:24:48	nberlat i can't do that because I'd have to dox them! (though I have actually met some former poors on here and hung out with them IRL)
MattBruenig	724786048778252289	2016-04-26T02:23:54	nberlat they paint a good overall picture of what's going on, e.g. this 
MattBruenig	724785427002040320	2016-04-26T02:21:26	nberlat And then there is an even greater skew in the lib arts majors that fill these ranks.
MattBruenig	724785299960811520	2016-04-26T02:20:56	nberlat Nope. The educational attainment stats are very clear that aint no poor people graduating from good 4-year colleges
MattBruenig	724784905541042177	2016-04-26T02:19:21	nberlat no you don't
MattBruenig	724784829154353153	2016-04-26T02:19:03	nberlat When I chime in to The Discourse, I want to be able to slam critics of my ideas as class privileged because it's useful
MattBruenig	724784639336955905	2016-04-26T02:18:18	nberlat I don't know that any of these discourse gymnastics for liberal arts grads advances any goals of any sort, but should be fair
MattBruenig	724784362991050752	2016-04-26T02:17:12	nberlat So it just never comes up since there are no poors or formerly poors in this niche little liberal arts circles
MattBruenig	724784188503760900	2016-04-26T02:16:31	nberlat the reason this is not something that happens is because the identitarian community is almost uniformly middle/upper class
MattBruenig	724784048657301504	2016-04-26T02:15:57	nberlat this is an actual interest of mine, I want to be able to do this in discourse, it's enjoyable and it's true rich people are biased
MattBruenig	724783675603337217	2016-04-26T02:14:28	nberlat just like you might do for a man on gender topics or white on racial topics; this follows directly from the discourse rules
MattBruenig	724783403778891776	2016-04-26T02:13:23	nberlat If we are talking about economic topics, then class privileged people should be able to made fun of and their opinions dismissed
MattBruenig	724783141613899776	2016-04-26T02:12:21	nberlat I don't know what is meant by "more visible." What I want is the consistent application of it to everything, as the texts suggest
MattBruenig	724782490112643074	2016-04-26T02:09:46	nberlat whatever you say of white people re: POC topics, you should say of upper people re: class, and so on
MattBruenig	724782294511304705	2016-04-26T02:08:59	nberlat yes, it's the entire framework that should move in identical fashion for class, disability, and so on, but it doesn't
MattBruenig	724782047269629953	2016-04-26T02:08:00	nberlat So people need to tell me if they are nondisabled so disabled people can tell them to shut up and listen or whatever
MattBruenig	724781926461128704	2016-04-26T02:07:31	nberlat But presumably being nondisabled makes you as ignorant on the issues of the disabled as being white does of the issues of POC
MattBruenig	724781607824068608	2016-04-26T02:06:15	nberlat Sure. There are plenty of other things that get short shrift in *discourse rules* because you can't see them
MattBruenig	724781311030886400	2016-04-26T02:05:04	nberlat Whatever you call it, the framework says a silver-spoon person needs to shut up and listen but I can't figure out who they arew
MattBruenig	724780812139388928	2016-04-26T02:03:06	nberlat Race and gender are immediately visible identities in most cases. Someone's class background however is generally hidden.
MattBruenig	724780602982027264	2016-04-26T02:02:16	nberlat This is a serious concern I've raised before about the way class-related identities get short shrift.
MattBruenig	724780283770314752	2016-04-26T02:01:00	nberlat I don't think it's at all far fetched that someone would downplay the importance of a bad practice they had a hand in.
MattBruenig	724779124569571328	2016-04-26T01:56:23	nberlat yes I think you were fixated on the word and would have been better to say "this isn't doxxing, but it's bad for X other reason"
MattBruenig	724778943446958080	2016-04-26T01:55:40	nberlat yes, occupation is an element of class
MattBruenig	724778785623691264	2016-04-26T01:55:02	nberlat X says racism is not a big deal. X is a white person who benefits from it.
MattBruenig	724778711938117632	2016-04-26T01:54:45	nberlat X says the focus on bank malfeaseance is too much. X worked for banks in an area where they were guilty of malfeasance.
MattBruenig	724778451446681601	2016-04-26T01:53:43	nberlat income+occupation+education are the typical components of socioeconomic status, which is a operationalized definition of "class"
MattBruenig	724778091722186753	2016-04-26T01:52:17	nberlat Sure. But question is whether it's doxxing or just another brand of bad stuff.
MattBruenig	724777694764912640	2016-04-26T01:50:42	nberlat Don't you see the problem though with saying you can't bring up someone's class/occupation but can bring up race/gender?
MattBruenig	724777381773369344	2016-04-26T01:49:28	nberlat I use him as an example because people do point at that he's white quite often when criticizing him for various things
MattBruenig	724777298910654464	2016-04-26T01:49:08	nberlat people would tweet ugly shit at him, in fact they already do!
MattBruenig	724776951114809344	2016-04-26T01:47:45	nberlat in any case, tim wise's race is public
MattBruenig	724776900988690432	2016-04-26T01:47:33	nberlat you said privacy doesn't come in, that what matters is the way it's used, not whether it's public
MattBruenig	724776265190924288	2016-04-26T01:45:01	nberlat so if the same behavior was done by a powerless no-name, then it wouldn't be doxxing?
MattBruenig	724775904866635776	2016-04-26T01:43:36	nberlat So if wrote a post about how Tim Wise is white in order to make some point about how his advocacy is bullshit, that's doxxing
MattBruenig	724775667435470852	2016-04-26T01:42:39	nberlat you said doxxing is about how the information is *used* not about its level of privacy
MattBruenig	724775020300492801	2016-04-26T01:40:05	nberlat SunnyDownSnuf freddiedeboer It's weaponized attention, no?
MattBruenig	724774974121230337	2016-04-26T01:39:54	nberlat SunnyDownSnuf freddiedeboer If someone reveals my race in order to point out how aloof and biased I am, is that doxxing?
MattBruenig	724753430552543232	2016-04-26T00:14:17	Why Retirement Accounts Would Not Work for Paid Leave I...  via MattBruenig 
MattBruenig	724770887107547136	2016-04-26T01:23:39	SunnyDownSnuf freddiedeboer nberlat how is "X worked for a bank" different from "X is a white person" as far as doxxing goes?
MattBruenig	724770534010015745	2016-04-26T01:22:15	SunnyDownSnuf freddiedeboer nberlat Surely class and occupation are just as relevant as gender and race in that.
MattBruenig	724770161459363841	2016-04-26T01:20:46	SunnyDownSnuf freddiedeboer nberlat The entire identitarian framework is premised upon interrogating the subject's life and identity.
MattBruenig	724725287796236288	2016-04-25T22:22:28	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak Rich people can opine on poverty without revealing their class privilege. Not so with other identities.
MattBruenig	724724842386362369	2016-04-25T22:20:41	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak But in any case, don't you see how these private identities are structurally biased against class?
MattBruenig	724724674492506112	2016-04-25T22:20:01	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak I can't see needing more than a few for the level of generality asked for. "I was in poverty X years"
MattBruenig	724723911867404289	2016-04-25T22:16:59	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak I don't feel like telling people "I grew up poor" is like saying "I was raped" personally
MattBruenig	724723643058675712	2016-04-25T22:15:55	Katie_Speak diannaeanderson I did not know she was a public figure or I would not have bothered you about it.
MattBruenig	724723446270287873	2016-04-25T22:15:08	Katie_Speak diannaeanderson Right. I followed your advice and found out that she (apparently) had two professional parents.
MattBruenig	724723126655967233	2016-04-25T22:13:52	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak I didn't ask you to tell me about your life. A simple "I was upper middle class" would do!
MattBruenig	724723060692140032	2016-04-25T22:13:37	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak We are, after all, talking about class. Why is that a private identity?
MattBruenig	724722953640902656	2016-04-25T22:13:11	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak Yes your joke pertained to my gender identity, as you explained. So I asked you about your class identity.
MattBruenig	724722678221950976	2016-04-25T22:12:05	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak But why do you get to come into a class conversation and not admit your privilege while splaining to me?
MattBruenig	724722563188948993	2016-04-25T22:11:38	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak I've written plenty about how invisible identities unfairly require confessions to establish bona fides.
MattBruenig	724722014943096833	2016-04-25T22:09:27	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak Someone's gender is relevant when talking gender, race when talking race. Why not class when talking class?
MattBruenig	724721858323615745	2016-04-25T22:08:50	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak I don't want to press you on it. But I do wonder why people are shy on their class when poverty is the topic.
MattBruenig	724721673837133824	2016-04-25T22:08:06	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak Katie is pressing on it. Google says you had two teacher parents which typically means not poor.
MattBruenig	724721099150364674	2016-04-25T22:05:49	Katie_Speak If Dianne hasn't, then she should be forthcoming about that and take a backseat when we are talking poverty (in my opinion).
MattBruenig	724720901510586368	2016-04-25T22:05:02	Katie_Speak In our case we have lived in poverty for a similar amount of years. So it is fine to engage you as an equal on it.
MattBruenig	724720670991638528	2016-04-25T22:04:07	Katie_Speak I know not everyone agrees with me on that and so do not think it's relevant to share their class identity in conversations.
MattBruenig	724720490040930305	2016-04-25T22:03:24	Katie_Speak I like to know when someone is of an upper class background because I think identity and experience matter.
MattBruenig	724720354887929856	2016-04-25T22:02:51	Katie_Speak This is why I asked her first about her class background, which she refused to give. Do you know it by any chance?
MattBruenig	724719912694980609	2016-04-25T22:01:06	WordsMeanings Katie_Speak Sometimes saying things are more complicated than they are is not harmful, but in this case I think it is.
MattBruenig	724719751331717120	2016-04-25T22:00:28	WordsMeanings Katie_Speak No. It's 1) not complicated, and 2) lying about it being complicated also is harmful
MattBruenig	724717430434615296	2016-04-25T21:51:14	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak the solution (proven in other countries) is also simple: big welfare state with lots of income transfers
MattBruenig	724717183205531648	2016-04-25T21:50:15	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak The mechanics are pretty simple, related mostly to nonworking populations (children, elderly, disabled, etc)
MattBruenig	724714395402670080	2016-04-25T21:39:11	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak That is, if you actually believe poverty is a type of oppression deserving of similar treatment (many don't)
MattBruenig	724714245514993664	2016-04-25T21:38:35	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak But it's just as wrong for a well-off person to splain poverty to someone who grew up in it as other splaining
MattBruenig	724713825983979520	2016-04-25T21:36:55	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak One of the things about class privilege is that it's not visible and so you get to carry it w/o admitting.
MattBruenig	724713570206883840	2016-04-25T21:35:54	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak I have had a problem of people richsplaining poverty to me in the past, so I just wanted to check.
MattBruenig	724713248537370624	2016-04-25T21:34:37	blendedpurple diannaeanderson Katie_Speak yes I guess I should emphasize that poverty is very simple in a dev country like the US
MattBruenig	724712551578259456	2016-04-25T21:31:51	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak How many years have you lived in poverty? Just curious.
MattBruenig	724711939109216256	2016-04-25T21:29:25	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak Not to say you intend to harm them. But just that you do in some slight way by furthering that narrative.
MattBruenig	724711780472250368	2016-04-25T21:28:47	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak it's extremely uncomplicated, and I think it's harmful to poor people for you to wrongly claim otherwise
MattBruenig	724711218712313857	2016-04-25T21:26:33	Katie_Speak No. But to say you have to solve those things to cut poverty is false and makes poverty seem harder to solve than it is.
MattBruenig	724710297710264320	2016-04-25T21:22:54	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak Casting poverty as complicated hurts the poor because it makes it seem like a massive undertaking to relieve
MattBruenig	724709885695418368	2016-04-25T21:21:15	diannaeanderson Katie_Speak It's extremely simple. As someone who grew up in deep poverty I hate when people lie about that.
MattBruenig	724709557134610432	2016-04-25T21:19:57	Katie_Speak Yes. I think it's important to communicate how simple it is because otherwise people think it's hard and don't do anything.
MattBruenig	724709025007415297	2016-04-25T21:17:50	Katie_Speak But this is beside the point. I just wanted to point out that the mechanism of poverty under capitalism are very simple
MattBruenig	724708631892090880	2016-04-25T21:16:16	Katie_Speak i read the article (where capitalism is not discussed) and the thread, where you didn't bring up the rich
MattBruenig	724706742874071041	2016-04-25T21:08:46	Katie_Speak weird how "rich" only comes in once prodded

MattBruenig	723521645051318273	2016-04-22T14:39:37	yeselson DouthatNYT jeffspross It's simple. Suppose T-1 GDP - 100 Tax - 30 (30%)  T-2 GDP - 120 Tax - 40 (33%)  Captured half the growth.

MattBruenig	722871008126963714	2016-04-20T19:34:13	ezralevin inclusionist indeed, they reduce the consumption of the would-be thief, perhaps meaning they increase "poverty" so defined
MattBruenig	722870746771517440	2016-04-20T19:33:10	ezralevin inclusionist anybody can lose consumption by being thieved or defrauded or whatever, but laws against are not anti-poverty laws
MattBruenig	722870362879471616	2016-04-20T19:31:39	ezralevin inclusionist I don't actually think that's a terribly useful concept, it confuses a separate matter of being fleeced
MattBruenig	722868413282934784	2016-04-20T19:23:54	inclusionist ezralevin it doesn't get you to how unemployment, being lowly educated, and living around certain people *is* poverty
MattBruenig	722868178645229572	2016-04-20T19:22:58	inclusionist ezralevin but that's an argument going on *within* the income approach, not *against* it
MattBruenig	722867941285310465	2016-04-20T19:22:02	inclusionist ezralevin again if you want to quibble over the *income concept* replacing it with things like realized consumption, OK

MattBruenig	722849800748720128	2016-04-20T18:09:57	RichardvReeves not only do you use the word to describe narrow debates about income poverty, but you use it rightly

MattBruenig	722831663852445696	2016-04-20T16:57:52	inclusionist jeffspross RichardvReeves this gets into income v. consumption as relevant unit which is not at all related to the convo
MattBruenig	722830478504407041	2016-04-20T16:53:10	Econ_Marshall inclusionist jeffspross RichardvReeves that's how reeves identifies unemployment: lacking a job

MattBruenig	722800986356654080	2016-04-20T14:55:58	The time has come. The once in a lifetime Matt Bruenig Election Team and Carl Diggler podcast --&gt; 
MattBruenig	722798172813307904	2016-04-20T14:44:47	femme_esq djsziff There's not that much evidence of it I thought. Sort of like there are a few cases of voter fraud people point to.
MattBruenig	722797065626062848	2016-04-20T14:40:24	djsziff femme_esq But everyone else, if they follow rules (get the ID, register right, find time on election day to vote), they can vote
MattBruenig	722796731881103360	2016-04-20T14:39:04	djsziff femme_esq These are people for whom *no* amount of following the rules would allow them to vote.
MattBruenig	722796627342331904	2016-04-20T14:38:39	djsziff femme_esq  but in that case the only disenfranchisement in the US right now is of children and non-citizens and felons
MattBruenig	722796491807571968	2016-04-20T14:38:07	djsziff femme_esq alternatively, we could define "disenfranchisement" as only applying to *over* banning (such as "no women shall vote")
MattBruenig	722796189868015616	2016-04-20T14:36:55	djsziff femme_esq the connotation of disenfranchisement as bad requires us to torture the hell out of defining it when we support it
MattBruenig	722795908467986432	2016-04-20T14:35:48	djsziff femme_esq right, the word at that point is being used neutrally instead of meaning solely "bad stuff"
MattBruenig	722795705291710465	2016-04-20T14:34:59	djsziff femme_esq even when those voters have a good faith interest in supporting one of the party's candidates
MattBruenig	722795585389084672	2016-04-20T14:34:31	djsziff femme_esq right, parties should (or at least have the ability to) disenfranchise voters that they think are not committed members
MattBruenig	722795193137803264	2016-04-20T14:32:57	djsziff femme_esq You go down to the DMV and you can register and get your voter ID
MattBruenig	722795058844577792	2016-04-20T14:32:25	djsziff femme_esq the distinction game isn't going to ride here, you can get a free voter ID in TX in the *process* of registering
MattBruenig	722794584007434241	2016-04-20T14:30:32	djsziff femme_esq But I language is hugely important so instead we are going to torture the phrase "disenfranchisement" instead
MattBruenig	722794119395983360	2016-04-20T14:28:41	djsziff femme_esq and then commitment is proxied by whether they were aware 6 months in advance or not
MattBruenig	722793997144600576	2016-04-20T14:28:12	djsziff femme_esq it's a primary content and so yes people should be disenfranchised if they don't have the necessary commitment
MattBruenig	722793662992789505	2016-04-20T14:26:52	djsziff femme_esq Again I think the point here would be more clear if people just said "voter disenfranchisment is justified in this case"
MattBruenig	722793227951206400	2016-04-20T14:25:09	djsziff femme_esq or (3) opted not to vote by choosing not to get an ID
MattBruenig	722792960438480897	2016-04-20T14:24:05	femme_esq so there are people who would vote but-for voter ID and these registration rules, but don't because of them
MattBruenig	722792727440703492	2016-04-20T14:23:09	femme_esq Bernie Sanders voters who did not fall into one of those groups (and others voters too presumably)
MattBruenig	722792481411198976	2016-04-20T14:22:11	femme_esq Right so my arg is that both procedural hurdles prevent people from voting
MattBruenig	722792319758503937	2016-04-20T14:21:32	femme_esq well in this case bernie sanders voters
MattBruenig	722792230902104064	2016-04-20T14:21:11	Imagine if pregnancy occurred near the beginning of one's career instead of the end of it 
MattBruenig	722791722061807616	2016-04-20T14:19:10	femme_esq Ok so explain why they aren't both disefranchising. That's all I am asking. Both certainly prevent people from voting who want to
MattBruenig	722791456180723713	2016-04-20T14:18:06	femme_esq because voters who want to vote are prevented from doing so
MattBruenig	722791290350542848	2016-04-20T14:17:27	femme_esq Presumably you also believe parties can use voter ID in the primary. After all, it's their primary dammit.
MattBruenig	722791166341685248	2016-04-20T14:16:57	femme_esq Once it is confirmed that both processes are disenfranchsing, we can argue about whether disenfranchisement is OK in primary.
MattBruenig	722790841379647488	2016-04-20T14:15:40	femme_esq I haven't seen you do that. So I can't really move the ball forward at all.
MattBruenig	722790677139058688	2016-04-20T14:15:00	femme_esq I am waiting for people to present a difference between the *process* of voter ID and the *process* of registration.
MattBruenig	722790413518696448	2016-04-20T14:13:58	OHTheMaryD registration is also similarly useless, isn't it? Where else do I use my registration documents?
MattBruenig	722790096878100480	2016-04-20T14:12:42	femme_esq Mary went for "free" v. "non-free" distinction. That failed. So what's next.
MattBruenig	722790027936317440	2016-04-20T14:12:26	femme_esq As a lawyer, you know the next move for someone trying to thread the needle is to hunt for distinctions to point at.
MattBruenig	722789936437530624	2016-04-20T14:12:04	femme_esq I am arguing that voter ID rules and registration rules are similar in that they both are hurdles that cut participation
MattBruenig	722789342352171008	2016-04-20T14:09:42	femme_esq It was OHTheMaryD who used the non-free nature of IDs as the relevant distinction. Not me.
MattBruenig	722788730008924160	2016-04-20T14:07:16	OHTheMaryD femme_esq For example, TX has voter ID, but you can get a free ID. So is that OK? 
MattBruenig	722788471719477248	2016-04-20T14:06:15	OHTheMaryD femme_esq So if getting an ID were free, then you would be OK with voter ID?
MattBruenig	722788095654043649	2016-04-20T14:04:45	femme_esq If abstract procedural fairness was real, surely somebody somewhere would say "yeah this is good process even tho it hurts me"
MattBruenig	722787964070273024	2016-04-20T14:04:14	femme_esq It doesn't have to be you. Can you think of anyone who supports a voting rule even though it reduces their side's influence?
MattBruenig	722787588965273600	2016-04-20T14:02:44	femme_esq Just as GOP fine with voter ID and Dem not. Outside of just extreme overt disenfranchisement, most rules have some plausibility
MattBruenig	722787370945417216	2016-04-20T14:01:52	femme_esq pro-Sanders people thought it unjust, pro-Hillary people thought it just, almost to a person
MattBruenig	722787181459337216	2016-04-20T14:01:07	femme_esq NY primary was an incredible natural experiment in this thesis and so far it has been majorly confirmed
MattBruenig	722786771860393984	2016-04-20T13:59:29	femme_esq Maybe if you had a counterexample of a voting rule that reduces your side's influence that you do support?
MattBruenig	722786634433961984	2016-04-20T13:58:57	femme_esq It predicts 100% of your views so far on which voting rules you like and dislike. So it at least is a good model for you.
MattBruenig	722786446386589696	2016-04-20T13:58:12	femme_esq 95% of the time someone's view on whether a voting rule is good can be predicted by whether they think it favors them
MattBruenig	722786309551628288	2016-04-20T13:57:39	femme_esq i think everyone's assembly of the problem is 100% self-serving. That my point. nobody cares about procedural stuff itself.
MattBruenig	722785942549970944	2016-04-20T13:56:12	ryanlcooper Econ_Marshall tressiemcphd but they are concentrated in lower class/income and receive less generational transfers
MattBruenig	722785759351193600	2016-04-20T13:55:28	ryanlcooper Econ_Marshall tressiemcphd according to this, blacks save same as whites by class and get similar returns
MattBruenig	722785595852996608	2016-04-20T13:54:49	ryanlcooper Econ_Marshall tressiemcphd I am familiar with the study that found this (as obv Darity is). It said income+inheritance.
MattBruenig	722775656308875265	2016-04-20T13:15:19	femme_esq If you thought voter ID dragged GOP participation, you'd find it plausible and fine. Hell most countries have it.
MattBruenig	722775437743628289	2016-04-20T13:14:27	femme_esq But this is true of 99% of people in the debate. That's just how it goes.
MattBruenig	722775291387604996	2016-04-20T13:13:52	femme_esq Where a hurdle drags participation of people you think are aligned with you, you care. Where it doesn't, you don't.
MattBruenig	722775132830375936	2016-04-20T13:13:14	femme_esq the analogy exists, you don't care to see it because your views on procedural voting hurdles is entirely driven by who it effects
MattBruenig	722774556910489600	2016-04-20T13:10:57	femme_esq This is one of the risks of not having photo identification. You don't get to work to change American politics effectively.
MattBruenig	722774017506164737	2016-04-20T13:08:48	femme_esq what's the substantive difference between jumping procedural hurdles to get a voter ID and procedural hurdles to register?
MattBruenig	722773788195229696	2016-04-20T13:07:54	karlskahn femme_esq and furthermore, if they don't do that, too bad
MattBruenig	722773598457503744	2016-04-20T13:07:09	Args last night were a great natural experiment on thesis of whether concern about procedural voting hurdles is driven by partisan concerns
MattBruenig	722772564490219521	2016-04-20T13:03:02	karlskahn femme_esq it would be a good idea for Dems to make their people aware of the voter ID rules, if they can't so be it imho
MattBruenig	722771618263605248	2016-04-20T12:59:16	adrienneleigh femme_esq this is what I always say to people who complain about voter ID: follow the damn rules and quit crying
MattBruenig	722771233474015232	2016-04-20T12:57:45	femme_esq this is what I always say to people who complain about voter ID: folks, tell you people to get the necessary ID!

MattBruenig	722607025285373952	2016-04-20T02:05:14	venzkec try answering the question as if there is no such thing as laws or courts in existence, please

MattBruenig	722605214310797312	2016-04-20T01:58:03	venzkec i speculate that without such verification, someone could come in saying they are someone they know is registered and vote as them
MattBruenig	722605088594903040	2016-04-20T01:57:33	venzkec i am a party and i identify it as extremely important only members of my party vote and I want to verify that by checking IDs
MattBruenig	722604893777879040	2016-04-20T01:56:46	venzkec which includes the goal of ensuring the sanctity of the vote
MattBruenig	722604732435599361	2016-04-20T01:56:08	venzkec suppose voter ID was straightforward and tied to the goal of the primary
MattBruenig	722604439517982720	2016-04-20T01:54:58	CarlBeijer wonder how many people we could bring to a Tweetup at a public bball court

MattBruenig	722599695583940609	2016-04-20T01:36:07	jbouie oh, I thought you were saying it wasn't disenfranchisement/suppression, i mistook you view
MattBruenig	722599317509402624	2016-04-20T01:34:37	merryohg so if IDs were free, you'd be fine with voter ID? that's the line?
MattBruenig	722598997899272192	2016-04-20T01:33:20	jbouie well the element that was onerous is, well, onerous, and so fitting your definition here of suppression
MattBruenig	722598446016917506	2016-04-20T01:31:09	JHWeissmann jbouie but i know the word "suppression" is negative so whatever the position is, it must not be able to be so described
MattBruenig	722598317037920256	2016-04-20T01:30:38	JHWeissmann jbouie i think it would be cleaner if this type of arg was just described as being pro-suppression for this kind of election
MattBruenig	722598058626785285	2016-04-20T01:29:37	jbouie is onerousness a binary thing or a matter of degree? surely 6mo registration is *more* onerous than same day
MattBruenig	722597830230208516	2016-04-20T01:28:42	jbouie noonanville what is that difference, it's one of degree not kind, right?
MattBruenig	722597626810667008	2016-04-20T01:27:54	SamAdlerBell jbouie I could see an arg that says only *explicit* denial of vote (e.g. no women can vote) counts, but then voter ID doesn't
MattBruenig	722597114124050432	2016-04-20T01:25:51	SamAdlerBell jbouie Yes the whole discussion is idiotic beyond belief. It's not a binary thing. Every hurdle drags participation at margin
MattBruenig	722596965029191680	2016-04-20T01:25:16	JHWeissmann jbouie this seems to be an argument for why voter suppression is OK in this kind of election not that it isn't happening
MattBruenig	722596593501868032	2016-04-20T01:23:47	JHWeissmann jbouie surely the type of election is not what defines whether a *vote* is suppressed
MattBruenig	722596068463128577	2016-04-20T01:21:42	jbouie In what ways is going through procedural hoops to get an ID substantively different from going through procedural hoops to register?
MattBruenig	722595894038765570	2016-04-20T01:21:00	jbouie what makes something voter suppression versus merely being a but-for cause of someone not voting? intent? magnitude?
MattBruenig	722595018461028352	2016-04-20T01:17:32	MattBruenig this is why the MBET shut out Nate Bronze at the Pulitzers
MattBruenig	722594663190945792	2016-04-20T01:16:07	Exclusive: tolerance for procedural rules that drag participation strongly correlated with sympathy towards the affected people
MattBruenig	722592867466813441	2016-04-20T01:08:59	alecpuente went on a 3 minute rant ostensibly about infrastructure in which he said such things as ayn rand was right
MattBruenig	722592311096565765	2016-04-20T01:06:46	Chris Matthews is on drugs this evening

MattBruenig	722589417161039872	2016-04-20T00:55:16	BillBindc jbouie but of course what people mean is that voter ID marginally cuts participation not that it's full blown disenfranchisement
MattBruenig	722589148671057920	2016-04-20T00:54:12	BillBindc jbouie Not unlike voter ID, which I am told is disenfranchisement yet getting an ID is not terribly unlike registering
MattBruenig	722588921427804160	2016-04-20T00:53:18	BillBindc jbouie 2-week will cut participation more than same-day, 1 month more than 2-week, 6 months more than 12 months, etc
MattBruenig	722588749801005056	2016-04-20T00:52:37	BillBindc jbouie it seems to me that "disenfranchisement" and "not disenfranchisement" isn't helpful, things drag participation marginally
MattBruenig	722587599341273088	2016-04-20T00:48:03	BillBindc jbouie so 12 months ahead of time is not disenfranchisement, 13 months? How about only register in Feb of every odd year?
MattBruenig	722586710090129408	2016-04-20T00:44:31	jbouie supposing I set the registration deadline X months before the election, at what X is it disenfranchisement?

MattBruenig	722511847165968386	2016-04-19T19:47:02	Econ_Marshall hamandcheese yes I mean it would obv be better to ditch EITC and just adopt finn-style housing allowance here

MattBruenig	722508308645588994	2016-04-19T19:32:58	KatzOnEarth resnikoff this piece struggled mightily to defend its point, settled on saying there will always be at least a tiny niche here
MattBruenig	722507424100413441	2016-04-19T19:29:28	related to our discussion a while ago Econ_Marshall 
MattBruenig	722499202597720069	2016-04-19T18:56:47	alecpuente are they running this already? I thought we were still in Get Things Done mode?
MattBruenig	722498676640198658	2016-04-19T18:54:42	hyperplanes matunos He's not saying to change the rules though. He's really just defending his desire to go all the way.
MattBruenig	722497841244028928	2016-04-19T18:51:23	matunos hyperplanes right, so this makes Bernie's point that everyone is crying about that the order distorts reality obviously true!
MattBruenig	722497504185610242	2016-04-19T18:50:03	matunos hyperplanes yes the iterative nature of state-by-state voting makes it even more "distortionary"
MattBruenig	722496139812061184	2016-04-19T18:44:37	hyperplanes wow holy god, that's a very problematic assertion to say such a thing. Please consult the think pieces.
MattBruenig	722495729344897025	2016-04-19T18:42:59	hyperplanes and then someone said that midprimary countings give a distorted picture of the national support for this reason
MattBruenig	722495374666149888	2016-04-19T18:41:35	hyperplanes now imagine if the vote of various states came in at different times and the states were not randomly populated
MattBruenig	722494957848813568	2016-04-19T18:39:55	_abby_c I am being obscure. This is meant to point out that Bernie's point about the state order is equivalent to precinct order points.
MattBruenig	722494089720131585	2016-04-19T18:36:28	I mean with 5% of precincts reporting you should be able to call almost any election. Huge sample size. Doesn't matter which precincts.
MattBruenig	722493527515643904	2016-04-19T18:34:14	Every anchor has these big TVs with maps on them to show you where the vote has and hasn't come in. Foolishly apparently because irrelevant.
MattBruenig	722492907052253185	2016-04-19T18:31:46	If the order that the vote comes in doesn't distort reality, I wonder why election anchors talk so much about which precincts have reported.
MattBruenig	722475881936134144	2016-04-19T17:24:07	Secretly the federal govt already manages $400+ billion in retirement assets through the TSP. My mentions assure me this is not possible.
MattBruenig	722474569672601600	2016-04-19T17:18:54	T_FisherKing interestingly, Bernie's advocacy on the voting rights act is what famously got Killer Mike interested in him
MattBruenig	722473843680546816	2016-04-19T17:16:01	thedissent is it vapid? most countries have voter ID, probably not all for political advantage reasons
MattBruenig	722473378297290753	2016-04-19T17:14:10	thedissent If you disagree with that point, I am interested in your opinion. But useful to actually respond to the point.
MattBruenig	722473237918130176	2016-04-19T17:13:37	thedissent The tweet you blockquoted made the point that the Dems only care because of *who* it disenfranchises
MattBruenig	722472799814750208	2016-04-19T17:11:53	Who is responsible for this account?

MattBruenig	722469819514273792	2016-04-19T17:00:02	kombiz even the longer held opinion is driven by calculations about substantive outcomes rather than procedural fairness itself
MattBruenig	722469158856880128	2016-04-19T16:57:24	dylanmatt Not to say that's an arg against more SS as a solution, just that more expansive Medicare coverage could also be a solution
MattBruenig	722468659097124864	2016-04-19T16:55:25	dylanmatt worth noting that higher elderly poverty under SPM driven by medical out-of-pocket expenses, lower than OPM when exclude MOOP
MattBruenig	722467207842807808	2016-04-19T16:49:39	kombiz ryanlcooper as with most things whether you like closed primaries turns on what process you think favors your desired outcome
MattBruenig	722464189374164994	2016-04-19T16:37:40	CarlBeijer deep_beige you can do 18-35 as well, obviously the 30/40/50 cut points are driven by base-10 number system
MattBruenig	722462845745688576	2016-04-19T16:32:19	If voter ID didn't have a disproportionate effect on dem voters, GOP wouldn't care to do it, and Dems wouldn't be terribly bothered by it.
MattBruenig	722462383311097856	2016-04-19T16:30:29	Fact is few people care about the procedural fairness of voting itself, up to a point at least. Mostly turns on which votes are affected.

MattBruenig	722423404180160512	2016-04-19T13:55:36	karlskahn certainly it changes magnitudes
MattBruenig	722422304056193024	2016-04-19T13:51:13	guan Sure. But if you know the stat is meaningless, surely it is on you not to use it, at that point.
MattBruenig	722421540944527360	2016-04-19T13:48:11	Like those states should have known he was going to intentionally misrepresent popular totals and so it's really on them.
MattBruenig	722421360874676224	2016-04-19T13:47:29	One guy doing this, when confronted, actually said something like "then those states shouldn't have held caucuses." heh
MattBruenig	722420821864681472	2016-04-19T13:45:20	Odd hack move I've seen in the election is goofy use of vote totals despite existence of caucuses. When confronted, crickets or anger.
MattBruenig	722420254106894336	2016-04-19T13:43:05	AlexRowell jbouie Doesn't negate ordering point. Also the amount of the lead matters for the narrative.
MattBruenig	722419236044455936	2016-04-19T13:39:02	alanarkay jbouie so this confirms the description about it being intentionally "rigged" (though arguably the rigging is good)
MattBruenig	722411851611578368	2016-04-19T13:09:41	SmithZakiya mattyglesias jbouie I don't know anything about how the order came about. I trust your account.
MattBruenig	722410417704824832	2016-04-19T13:03:59	SmithZakiya mattyglesias jbouie if there is intentionality on that substantive level, then seems to give credence to "rigging" point
MattBruenig	722407787758764032	2016-04-19T12:53:32	mattyglesias jbouie not sure what your actual substantive criticism of this trivially true point is to be honest
MattBruenig	722407402612662273	2016-04-19T12:52:01	mattyglesias jbouie While a different delegate-weighted ordering of states would have done the same in reverse, seems uncontroversial
MattBruenig	722407166947237888	2016-04-19T12:51:04	mattyglesias jbouie The delegate-weighted ordering of states created a very nationally unrepresentative lead leading to delegate math pts
MattBruenig	722406777711669248	2016-04-19T12:49:32	fivefifths But in any case if we agree order affects story and that order has dynamic effects on later states, feel like we're on same page
MattBruenig	722406420063338496	2016-04-19T12:48:06	fivefifths conceptually there would still be one where path stayed closest to end result even accounting for each path's endogenous effects
MattBruenig	722405974749917185	2016-04-19T12:46:20	ColinMoreshead jbouie I don't know about the second question, but first one is all you need to conclude order "distorts reality"
MattBruenig	722405879656656896	2016-04-19T12:45:58	ColinMoreshead jbouie so we concede narrative dramatically different based on order, second question is how much early races affect later
MattBruenig	722405797934862337	2016-04-19T12:45:38	fivefifths Medley what the eventual outcome will be
MattBruenig	722405382036041729	2016-04-19T12:43:59	ColinMoreshead jbouie Yes, the story would be much different. That's exactly th epoint.
MattBruenig	722405106969415680	2016-04-19T12:42:53	fivefifths Medley right, some more than others perhaps, can imagine one where states order keeps things close to representative
MattBruenig	722404262177849345	2016-04-19T12:39:32	Medley jbouie fivefifths (rebuttals of the general point that is, not necessarily rebuttals about other remarks he makes related to it)
MattBruenig	722404131311394816	2016-04-19T12:39:01	Medley jbouie fivefifths it's not tautological, it's just obviously true, which is precisely why I think the rebuttals are odd
MattBruenig	722403840717365248	2016-04-19T12:37:51	fivefifths Medley jbouie yes but if anything the dynamic point cuts even further for bernie if early vote leaves impression he can't win
MattBruenig	722403443906846721	2016-04-19T12:36:17	karlskahn jbouie surely any order that leads to a large unrepresentative delegate lead for one candidate is "unfair" to the other
MattBruenig	722402940565250048	2016-04-19T12:34:17	Medley jbouie fivefifths distorts in the sense that on the way to a complete pop survey I do 50 nonrandom subsamples
MattBruenig	722402835791523841	2016-04-19T12:33:52	Medley jbouie fivefifths distorts meaning that it tells a story about the level of overall support that isn't true
MattBruenig	722402608615448576	2016-04-19T12:32:58	fivefifths jbouie that may be, this is the kind of argument I think that actually responds to order distortion point
MattBruenig	722402175830401024	2016-04-19T12:31:14	jbouie fivefifths I hear the words "delegate math" 20x a day, which is purely a state-sequence point.
MattBruenig	722401898238779393	2016-04-19T12:30:08	jbouie fivefifths I didn't say it was OK. I just agree with the point that the order distorts. That's what I see Bernie saying.
MattBruenig	722401729778708480	2016-04-19T12:29:28	karlskahn jbouie By the end of this election, I could draw a map that would have hillary having to make the biggest comeback in history
MattBruenig	722401575562526721	2016-04-19T12:28:51	karlskahn jbouie "vote" is meaningless as you know because many states used caucuses
MattBruenig	722401161731522560	2016-04-19T12:27:13	fivefifths jbouie And she may very well do that!
MattBruenig	722401048879591424	2016-04-19T12:26:46	fivefifths jbouie In a different order, the story right now would be that Hillary has to make the biggest comeback victory ever
MattBruenig	722400753135001600	2016-04-19T12:25:35	fivefifths jbouie I agree with all of this. I am not saying anything foul has happened either. But for pt that order distorts. It does!
MattBruenig	722400035313475584	2016-04-19T12:22:44	jbouie yes
MattBruenig	722399957496565760	2016-04-19T12:22:26	jbouie as it is, the early delegate math lead of Hillary was nowhere near reflective of her actual margin over bernie
MattBruenig	722399832539848704	2016-04-19T12:21:56	jbouie I don't feel like this is a complicated point. If you sequence states differently, Bernie could have had enormous delegate math lead
MattBruenig	722399605900636160	2016-04-19T12:21:02	jbouie they clearly were, she won all of those except NH
MattBruenig	722399476133064705	2016-04-19T12:20:31	ICUDrEd jbouie the scenario in which this may not happen is if the states were sequences so that bernie states were heavily frontloaded
MattBruenig	722398891459653632	2016-04-19T12:18:11	bushnellmike jbouie not saying there is any foul play, I don't know of the history of why the South goes so early, do you?
MattBruenig	722398545970597892	2016-04-19T12:16:49	jbouie I think his arg is right that the narrative becomes heavily distorted where state sequence is so frontloaded in favor of opponent
MattBruenig	722398028284436480	2016-04-19T12:14:46	jbouie process is inherently distortionary as relevant population is All Dem Primary Voters and each state sample is not representative
MattBruenig	722397273846648832	2016-04-19T12:11:46	jbouie what if super tuesday was the last 8 states we just ran through instead of the south, the "delegate math" narrative would be flipped
MattBruenig	722396792327913472	2016-04-19T12:09:51	earlmanwich jbouie some people argue that the impression of a huge lead affects future voting outcomes
MattBruenig	722396206907920384	2016-04-19T12:07:31	jbouie Would be talking about the enormous landslides Hillary needed to come back from behind instead of vice versa
MattBruenig	722395867425202176	2016-04-19T12:06:10	jbouie his arg right but not for the reasons he gives, if the states were ordered so those most supportive of Bernie were first, diff story

MattBruenig	720677885481259008	2016-04-14T18:19:32	tbhayward essentially the metric assumes a 2-person family needs 1.4x the family income of a 1-person family to have same living standard
MattBruenig	720677423851970560	2016-04-14T18:17:42	tbhayward BUT you don't need proportionally more (i.e. 2x as much for family that's 2x as big) bc of economies of scale to living together
MattBruenig	720677209288110080	2016-04-14T18:16:50	tbhayward This is a way of reflecting fact that you need more family income if you have a bigger family size to be out of povety
MattBruenig	720676964592402432	2016-04-14T18:15:52	tbhayward  To adjust family income for family size, metric divides total family income by the square root of the number of family members
MattBruenig	720676417508352000	2016-04-14T18:13:42	tbhayward mattyglesias i don't mean to say they actually have $141, I mean to say they are coded as having $141 adjusted for family size
MattBruenig	720676027014496256	2016-04-14T18:12:09	tbhayward mattyglesias this is exacerbated by fact that women live longer and tend to have lower earnings-related pension bc of wage gap
MattBruenig	720675839000625152	2016-04-14T18:11:24	tbhayward mattyglesias When one dies, it's a one-pensioner family whose equivalized income is $100/sqrt(1) = $100. So 29% income drop.
MattBruenig	720675644380733442	2016-04-14T18:10:37	tbhayward mattyglesias Two-pensioner family where both have $100 pensions would have equivalized income of $200/sqrt(2) = $141
MattBruenig	720673823515930624	2016-04-14T18:03:23	mattyglesias helped along by fact that women live longer and have lower earnings-related pension for wage gap reasons
MattBruenig	720673019128127488	2016-04-14T18:00:11	mattyglesias i don't know, but I'd guess this is spouses dying and the equivalization factor going from sqrt(2) to sqrt(1)

MattBruenig	720401143906582528	2016-04-13T23:59:51	JoshuaMound Econ_Marshall There is a book arguing that the NLRA allows you to be members-only minority union AND compel bargaining.
MattBruenig	720400157465030656	2016-04-13T23:55:56	JoshuaMound Econ_Marshall When you are the exclusive rep, if the Employer doesn't come to the bargaining table, that violates the law.
MattBruenig	720400033217146880	2016-04-13T23:55:26	JoshuaMound Econ_Marshall yes the law allows it, but if you go that route you cannot compel the employer to bargain with you
MattBruenig	720377549486837761	2016-04-13T22:26:06	JoshuaMound Econ_Marshall The downside is that the employer only has a legal duty to bargain with certified exclusive representatives
MattBruenig	720377430779650048	2016-04-13T22:25:38	JoshuaMound Econ_Marshall It is possible to be a union that only represents its members by not seeking exclusive representative status

MattBruenig	720314441825460224	2016-04-13T18:15:20	Econ_Marshall it's a weird distinction to make between a $1 earner and a $0 earner that the former gets entire rent and latter none
MattBruenig	720314224208023552	2016-04-13T18:14:28	MattBruenig Econ_Marshall which would then phase out at 30%

MattBruenig	720313077724352512	2016-04-13T18:09:55	Econ_Marshall  the new benefit would be equal to the difference between 30% of the household's disp income and the area fair market rent

MattBruenig	719977621401006080	2016-04-12T19:56:56	smoothkobra That's not what she wrote! She said young white men are the "primary" supporters, which both of us agree is false.
MattBruenig	719977480447254528	2016-04-12T19:56:22	smoothkobra (virtually nonexistent) and so in that sense it doesn't "matter". But her lying matters obviously.
MattBruenig	719977382808051712	2016-04-12T19:55:59	smoothkobra Your misunderstanding the different uses of "matter." I am saying *analytically* male/female divide among youngs is nonexistent
MattBruenig	719977042717077504	2016-04-12T19:54:38	smoothkobra We both agree that her article should have been about how young white men and women are the big base. But she didn't.
MattBruenig	719976935619719168	2016-04-12T19:54:12	smoothkobra I agree with you that it's irrelevant. It's Jill who is writing articles saying young white men are primary support not me!
MattBruenig	719976584338403328	2016-04-12T19:52:48	IKEAtkinson That's how all this started. A bad article written on a provably false empirical premise about voter demos.
MattBruenig	719976450984701952	2016-04-12T19:52:17	IKEAtkinson it *disproves* the claim that he is primarily supported by young white men, which is what Filipovic wrote today
MattBruenig	719976148097187842	2016-04-12T19:51:04	smoothkobra Once again, I ask: what is it to lie about facts in order to support an agenda? What is the name for that?
MattBruenig	719976046871842816	2016-04-12T19:50:40	smoothkobra She wrote article that was premised upon young white men being the "primary" supporters of Bernie, when its young white women!
MattBruenig	719975909432954881	2016-04-12T19:50:07	smoothkobra People do care! It's really important for Jill that this not be true! (I am with you though that I don't think it matters)
MattBruenig	719975512593035264	2016-04-12T19:48:33	smoothkobra Suppose someone had said Bernie's support is "primarily young white men." Would it be relevant to that claim?
MattBruenig	719975111504343040	2016-04-12T19:46:57	smoothkobra Do young white women prefer Bernie more than young white men?
MattBruenig	719975001198342144	2016-04-12T19:46:31	smoothkobra Why is this so painful for you guys? I have never seen people dance around such a simple provable fact.
MattBruenig	719974860479406084	2016-04-12T19:45:57	smoothkobra What would it take Smooth for you to simply say true to claim "young white women support Bernie more than young white men"?
MattBruenig	719974647840829440	2016-04-12T19:45:07	AmyDentata JillFilipovic it's clearer in context that's what I am doing, I can understand alone how it wouldn't be
MattBruenig	719974533759922177	2016-04-12T19:44:39	AmyDentata JillFilipovic it's not a good faith question, I am criticizing Jill here because this is what she does in her writing
MattBruenig	719974223029121024	2016-04-12T19:43:25	smoothkobra What would it take for you to tweet: young white women support Bernie at larger margins than young white men?
MattBruenig	719974145493176321	2016-04-12T19:43:07	smoothkobra What's so fascinating is that I literally cannot get a single pro-Hillary person to admit the facts about young white women.
MattBruenig	719973927913680896	2016-04-12T19:42:15	smoothkobra What do you call lying about facts in order to support an agenda in Smooth Kobra world?
MattBruenig	719973777438846977	2016-04-12T19:41:39	smoothkobra Previously she wrote an article saying there wasn't any evidence Bernie was winning huge among youngs, also a lie.
MattBruenig	719973561474097152	2016-04-12T19:40:48	smoothkobra Jill knows the answer is young white women but she writes pieces that say the opposite because she's a hack.
MattBruenig	719973352094490624	2016-04-12T19:39:58	smoothkobra Does bernie have more support among young white women or young white men? This is a factual question that is easy to answer.
MattBruenig	719971837099290624	2016-04-12T19:33:57	AlGiordano it's not a civil question in search of any kind of answer, it's just a fun way to point out her shitty writing about young women
MattBruenig	719971489014026240	2016-04-12T19:32:34	AlGiordano your ability to interpret text is not very good, here's a hint: the question is actually a (true) criticism of her writing

MattBruenig	719943847497842688	2016-04-12T17:42:43	Econ_Marshall esoltas ErikLoomis glenweyl right that's exactly what I was thinking

MattBruenig	719942588422365185	2016-04-12T17:37:43	Econ_Marshall esoltas ErikLoomis glenweyl Uber gives them a 1099, I think they do characterize it as Uber paying for the labor
MattBruenig	719942441919463425	2016-04-12T17:37:08	Econ_Marshall esoltas ErikLoomis glenweyl Doesn't Uber say the workers are independent contractors contracting *with* Uber?
MattBruenig	719940804006043649	2016-04-12T17:30:38	Econ_Marshall esoltas ErikLoomis glenweyl That of course should mean less likelihood of prices getting set way too high

MattBruenig	719608179169107969	2016-04-11T19:28:54	theshrillest but even if you fund private HBCUs, it's *still* the case that defunding publics helps them
MattBruenig	719607379143303168	2016-04-11T19:25:43	theshrillest if funding is harmful, then defunding is helpful, in most extreme situation, you could even negatively fund publics
MattBruenig	719606645022728192	2016-04-11T19:22:48	theshrillest I agree with the basic structure of the arg. I am just interested to see where people are willing to go with it.
MattBruenig	719605738457473026	2016-04-11T19:19:12	theshrillest I looked into numbers on this (or had someone else) and although enrollment was negative over period, it was not *as* negative
MattBruenig	719605123056594944	2016-04-11T19:16:45	On the other hand, this has been good for private HBCUs. Got to at least be upfront about that.

MattBruenig	718120354783342592	2016-04-07T16:56:49	50 Years of the US Tax System and the Rise of Nontax Revenue  by MattBruenig 
MattBruenig	718115973644087296	2016-04-07T16:39:24	mattyglesias yeselson SethAckerman DavidKaib Maybe you take issue with its inclusion in those indexes. But you are the odd one out.
MattBruenig	718115668789485569	2016-04-07T16:38:12	mattyglesias yeselson SethAckerman DavidKaib You act like underinsurance is a new concept. It's used in health care system rankings.
MattBruenig	718114825029742593	2016-04-07T16:34:50	mattyglesias yeselson SethAckerman DavidKaib since his point is precisely that uninsured/insured misses rate of actual access
MattBruenig	718114617168412674	2016-04-07T16:34:01	mattyglesias yeselson SethAckerman DavidKaib Rich asked Seth what his point was, I was translating it into a similar trend line
MattBruenig	718114360246317058	2016-04-07T16:33:00	mattyglesias yeselson SethAckerman DavidKaib You could of course insure everyone in the country tomorrow with a 1 million deductible
MattBruenig	718114287290609664	2016-04-07T16:32:42	mattyglesias yeselson SethAckerman DavidKaib I am just trying to put the bronze plan issue into comparable uninsurance rate language
MattBruenig	718113491186528257	2016-04-07T16:29:32	yeselson SethAckerman DavidKaib then the "real" reduction in a uninsurance index would be much lower given rise of high deductible
MattBruenig	718113102160637955	2016-04-07T16:28:00	yeselson SethAckerman DavidKaib if you think of uninsurance on a spectrum that dings you for insurance you can't really afford to use
MattBruenig	718105362575015936	2016-04-07T15:57:14	yeselson SethAckerman DavidKaib I read the "in the US" part of the original tweet as having a more historical tinge to it.
MattBruenig	718104490906423300	2016-04-07T15:53:47	yeselson SethAckerman DavidKaib straining somewhat the claim that the current level of uninsureds is "a big deal" in the US
MattBruenig	718104108968910849	2016-04-07T15:52:15	yeselson SethAckerman DavidKaib i have little doubt that without ACA it'd be in the mid-teens, but also true that we've been here before

MattBruenig	718091697566179329	2016-04-07T15:02:56	yeselson DavidKaib CEA put it at 11.4% in 1980, 11.3% in 2014 
MattBruenig	718070182304989184	2016-04-07T13:37:27	DavidKaib yeselson we've actually been around 10% before.

MattBruenig	717902808331206656	2016-04-07T02:32:22	neeratanden pmtomaino I didn't even attack your odd claim about welfare reform being "about ensuring every child has opportunity"

MattBruenig	717800642983628802	2016-04-06T19:46:24	Savion_C barentw JoeDunman sbagen The independents that come out to vote for him do not necessarily like Democrats.
MattBruenig	717799986432512000	2016-04-06T19:43:47	barentw Democrats are bad! Look at the Iraq war.
MattBruenig	717799816005357568	2016-04-06T19:43:06	Savion_C barentw JoeDunman sbagen What are you supposed to do about that?
MattBruenig	717799761601044483	2016-04-06T19:42:53	Savion_C barentw JoeDunman sbagen You seem to be missing that Bernie receives votes from people who rightly do not like Democrats.
MattBruenig	717799495266877440	2016-04-06T19:41:50	barentw Savion_C JoeDunman sbagen I am not sure what Bernie pretends to care about. I like social democracy. That's about it.
MattBruenig	717799273295966209	2016-04-06T19:40:57	Savion_C barentw JoeDunman sbagen In what alternative do the independents and youngs and such that come out for Bernie vote for this?
MattBruenig	717799075391926274	2016-04-06T19:40:10	Savion_C barentw JoeDunman sbagen This needs a "so what" explanation here.
MattBruenig	717798733799358464	2016-04-06T19:38:48	Savion_C barentw JoeDunman sbagen It's a good thing Bernie ran and gave the poor guy a shot at winning though. Very commendable.
MattBruenig	717798520531582976	2016-04-06T19:37:58	barentw JoeDunman sbagen And continue to just eviscerate itself across the entire country (which I know libs also say is leftist's fault)
MattBruenig	717798386112573440	2016-04-06T19:37:25	barentw JoeDunman sbagen Like the alternative is Hillary where the Dems still fail in identical fashion to receive independent votes?
MattBruenig	717798274468560897	2016-04-06T19:36:59	barentw JoeDunman sbagen And the Dem judges will also not be elected in either scenario though, right?
MattBruenig	717798136861880320	2016-04-06T19:36:26	barentw Bernie doesn't like Democrats, neither do many of the independents who vote for him. Where is the issue?
MattBruenig	717797449658732548	2016-04-06T19:33:42	barentw JoeDunman sbagen Is it your contention that independents who come out for Bernie will, under Hillary, vote for Dem judges?
MattBruenig	717797288731668481	2016-04-06T19:33:04	barentw JoeDunman sbagen Walk me through the actual problem here by referencing general elections and the like.
MattBruenig	717796818785067008	2016-04-06T19:31:12	barentw JoeDunman sbagen Let's suppose this is true. What is its practical importance?
MattBruenig	717795924307783680	2016-04-06T19:27:39	JoeDunman sbagen Guess this is why you get "without comment." Gesture "this is bad" without embarrassing yourself by explaining how.
MattBruenig	717795602331992067	2016-04-06T19:26:22	JoeDunman sbagen For evidence of this, see how many turned out to vote for Obama in the primary in 2012 when he had no competition.
MattBruenig	717795533352484865	2016-04-06T19:26:05	JoeDunman sbagen But Bernie's not bad. His candidacy is the only reason the judge even had a chance of winning. No Bernie, no turnout.
MattBruenig	717795240342593536	2016-04-06T19:24:55	JoeDunman sbagen In that sense the only reason the race was even remotely close was because Bernie supporters were moved to vote at all
MattBruenig	717795143135395840	2016-04-06T19:24:32	JoeDunman sbagen By how much would the judge have won if only the GOP had a contested primary? A massive margin, no?
MattBruenig	717794972179828737	2016-04-06T19:23:52	JoeDunman sbagen Is it supposed to be that Bernie's supporters are bad? That Bernie is bad? That they'd won if Bernie wasn't running?
MattBruenig	717793893924909056	2016-04-06T19:19:34	JoeDunman sbagen I don't even understand what the point is. Perhaps that's what Sam offered no comment, there is none to make.

MattBruenig	717778400660877312	2016-04-06T18:18:01	AllOnMedicare It is usually the "liberal" defense of welfare for poor families with children that it's not the kids fault
MattBruenig	717778277675491328	2016-04-06T18:17:31	AllOnMedicare I guess. I have a hard time making reason of it. Making life worse for poor parents makes it worse for their kids.
MattBruenig	717777793317269505	2016-04-06T18:15:36	AllOnMedicare it really is enraging to see a discussion of welfare reform turn into a talk about how poor parents are fucked up

MattBruenig	717721696015360001	2016-04-06T14:32:41	GavinHJackson MattZeitlin dylanmatt his targets have liberal constraints in them, so yes
MattBruenig	717721003854536704	2016-04-06T14:29:56	GavinHJackson MattZeitlin dylanmatt point really is that he's basically institutionally agnostic provided they're consistent w/ targets
MattBruenig	717718870656753667	2016-04-06T14:21:27	GavinHJackson MattZeitlin dylanmatt yeah but he uses liberty differently than libertarians who have mainly just redefined it as property
MattBruenig	717718029757452289	2016-04-06T14:18:07	MattZeitlin dylanmatt oh, right, those types generally just look like center-left libs with an attitude
MattBruenig	717717385797611521	2016-04-06T14:15:33	MattZeitlin dylanmatt might depend on libertarian you are talking to, most hate redistribution and say it hurts the poor in long run
MattBruenig	717716477227495428	2016-04-06T14:11:57	MattZeitlin dylanmatt yeah, but it's mainly just based on false claim that equality hurts growth and thus the "worst-off" in long run

MattBruenig	715907246874562560	2016-04-01T14:22:43	Econ_Marshall JoshuaMound right but underscores need for VAT or other tax to capture enough money once it predistributes

MattBruenig	715237061268213764	2016-03-30T17:59:38	m0veablebeast jeffspross where GDP literally goes down (as opposed to simply not growing), then yes you have to cut incomes
MattBruenig	715236608547635200	2016-03-30T17:57:50	m0veablebeast jeffspross ??? Your point was about shrinkage not growth
MattBruenig	715236070070358017	2016-03-30T17:55:42	m0veablebeast jeffspross surely you understand the difference between no growth and shrinking
MattBruenig	715235583279370241	2016-03-30T17:53:46	m0veablebeast jeffspross sustainability is a function having a balanced age distribution, more more specifically a high enough EPOP

MattBruenig	715233618893938688	2016-03-30T17:45:57	ivorytowerstyle Econ_Marshall yep, though maybe they can be reemployed as pickers and forklift drivers to load the driverless trucks
MattBruenig	715232557462327296	2016-03-30T17:41:44	ivorytowerstyle Econ_Marshall it's the elimination of trucking jobs that's gonna bite the most, we got lots of truckers and theyre paid OK

MattBruenig	715190718944378881	2016-03-30T14:55:29	jbouie Maybe they do. I am not sure. If party is chasing median voter, then I am not sure why they'd care about left priorities.
MattBruenig	715189924044140544	2016-03-30T14:52:20	jbouie In parliamentary system of course you keep the Left Party happy because they can exit govt and force an election.
MattBruenig	715189699099377664	2016-03-30T14:51:26	jbouie Maybe concerned left bloc will grow big enough to primary her (doubtful)? But then again so could Left Party get big enough.
MattBruenig	715189529792102402	2016-03-30T14:50:46	jbouie Not clear why she would care about the left bloc anymore than Center Party would care about Left Party members.
MattBruenig	715188488883277824	2016-03-30T14:46:37	jbouie So she's still really a modest plurality president with a left faction having been coalitioned to make it a majority
MattBruenig	715188021033832448	2016-03-30T14:44:46	jbouie In current system, she also only has 35% of the support, but because of party coalitions, 20% of her opposition is folded in
MattBruenig	715187674009767936	2016-03-30T14:43:23	jbouie So in a full-out election with many parties, let's say Hillary's Center Party gets 35% of the vote, enough for plurality, she's prez

MattBruenig	715186498652528640	2016-03-30T14:38:43	jbouie if your first tweet is true, then the current system already leads to modest pluralities taking power

MattBruenig	714497534283096064	2016-03-28T17:01:01	joanwalsh "white" means "nonhispanic white" in basically every racial breakdown you'll ever see, "hispanic whites" counted as "hispanic"
MattBruenig	714496867724345350	2016-03-28T16:58:22	joanwalsh they identify as "hispanic white" as opposed to "hispanic black" or "hispanic asian" but it's all grouped under latino, POC
MattBruenig	714495993123901441	2016-03-28T16:54:54	joanwalsh the point about the tables being confusing was fine, the point about how latinos maybe *are* white is silly
MattBruenig	714495345208729605	2016-03-28T16:52:19	iDXR joanwalsh JonathanDBrown tokyovampires hispanic whites are always classified as hispanics, separate from "nonhispanic whites"
MattBruenig	714495075460521985	2016-03-28T16:51:15	iDXR joanwalsh JonathanDBrown tokyovampires but previously in election she clearly distinguished latinos from whites, as I showed
MattBruenig	714494982300823553	2016-03-28T16:50:53	iDXR joanwalsh JonathanDBrown tokyovampires now she's kind of ambivalent on whether latinos are whites
MattBruenig	714494837098225668	2016-03-28T16:50:18	iDXR joanwalsh JonathanDBrown tokyovampires i only got in this thread because Joan had mistaken the census data she referred to
MattBruenig	714494517102125056	2016-03-28T16:49:02	iDXR joanwalsh JonathanDBrown tokyovampires oh, she's conflated them with whites in hawaii, that's what the thread is about
MattBruenig	714494382355914752	2016-03-28T16:48:30	MattBruenig iDXR joanwalsh JonathanDBrown tokyovampires here's one 
MattBruenig	714494197550682112	2016-03-28T16:47:46	iDXR joanwalsh JonathanDBrown tokyovampires i mean you want me to find instances where she's contrasting "latinos" with "whites"?
MattBruenig	714492962068107264	2016-03-28T16:42:51	iDXR joanwalsh JonathanDBrown tokyovampires i have never seen anyone refer to "latino" voters as white voters until now
MattBruenig	714491910409347074	2016-03-28T16:38:40	joanwalsh BlobertP @iamdanielsj tokyovampires they mean they are going from "hispanic white" to "nonhispanic white" in the census
MattBruenig	714491804717068288	2016-03-28T16:38:15	joanwalsh BlobertP @iamdanielsj tokyovampires when ppl say "hispanics now identify as white" they mean they aren't checking hispanic box
MattBruenig	714490933061033985	2016-03-28T16:34:47	joanwalsh iDXR JonathanDBrown tokyovampires and in general they are called that
MattBruenig	714490883673034752	2016-03-28T16:34:35	joanwalsh iDXR JonathanDBrown tokyovampires but regardless, we have been calling hispanic whites POC the whole election
MattBruenig	714490207165419520	2016-03-28T16:31:54	joanwalsh iDXR JonathanDBrown tokyovampires but don't call arizona a diverse state then, it's 84% "white"
MattBruenig	714489924548952064	2016-03-28T16:30:47	joanwalsh iDXR JonathanDBrown tokyovampires if you want to make an arg that "hispanic whites" are not quite POC, I guess that's fine
MattBruenig	714489469123039232	2016-03-28T16:28:58	iDXR JonathanDBrown joanwalsh tokyovampires which is the relevant classification to this thread about Hawaii's diversity
MattBruenig	714489157452767232	2016-03-28T16:27:44	iDXR JonathanDBrown joanwalsh tokyovampires in the narrow case of election, I think most have been saying latinos are POC though
MattBruenig	714488701007605760	2016-03-28T16:25:55	EnriqueDiazAlva right, but they aren't in US in big numbers, I'd assume this person was basically "pure Spanish" lineage
MattBruenig	714488356407808000	2016-03-28T16:24:33	iDXR JonathanDBrown joanwalsh tokyovampires since it doesn't consider latino a race
MattBruenig	714488305379905538	2016-03-28T16:24:21	iDXR JonathanDBrown joanwalsh tokyovampires but they don't usually identify that way, that's the problem, census calls them white
MattBruenig	714487849295417345	2016-03-28T16:22:32	iDXR joanwalsh tokyovampires Joan misidentified Hawaii's "hispanic whites" that way bc the table and classification system is confusing.
MattBruenig	714487467202764801	2016-03-28T16:21:01	Usually "hispanic white" classification is confusing (society doesn't read as white), but I found the one case where it was very correct.
MattBruenig	714486972421693441	2016-03-28T16:19:03	At my school was a Venezuelan, blond hair, blue eyes, paler than me, whose wealthy family had apparently been expropriated by Hugo.
MattBruenig	714486608515502080	2016-03-28T16:17:36	BlobertP joanwalsh @iamdanielsj tokyovampires not sure what battle census is fighting by hanging on to its "not race, ethnicity" thing
MattBruenig	714486515913662464	2016-03-28T16:17:14	BlobertP joanwalsh @iamdanielsj tokyovampires they really should, race is a construct, and obv hispanic has been constructed as race
MattBruenig	714486333650022401	2016-03-28T16:16:31	The issue of how to define "hispanic whites" as the Census calls them reminds me of a funny story from my ole college days.
MattBruenig	714484700874731520	2016-03-28T16:10:01	joanwalsh BlobertP @iamdanielsj tokyovampires and "hispanic" + "white only" is how vast majority of latinos are classified
MattBruenig	714484530015502337	2016-03-28T16:09:21	joanwalsh BlobertP @iamdanielsj tokyovampires so point is can be (1) in race ("white alone") but also hispanic 
MattBruenig	714484200804581376	2016-03-28T16:08:02	joanwalsh BlobertP @iamdanielsj tokyovampires no controversy over what census means by "white alone" - it's (1) 
MattBruenig	714484012186779649	2016-03-28T16:07:17	joanwalsh BlobertP @iamdanielsj tokyovampires this is about how "hispanic whites" become "nonhispanic whites"
MattBruenig	714483266930282497	2016-03-28T16:04:19	joanwalsh BlobertP @iamdanielsj tokyovampires hispanic not treated as race, so "white alone" means they aren't white+black, white+asian
MattBruenig	714483058456600576	2016-03-28T16:03:30	joanwalsh BlobertP @iamdanielsj tokyovampires it is confusing, but "white alone" means they are white with no other *race*
MattBruenig	714482617941434368	2016-03-28T16:01:45	BlobertP joanwalsh @iamdanielsj tokyovampires yeah basically all hispanics except some from the islands are "hispanic whites"
MattBruenig	714482305503531010	2016-03-28T16:00:30	joanwalsh BlobertP @iamdanielsj tokyovampires the table is weirdly organized, but that's NON-hispanic whites 
MattBruenig	714481505318346752	2016-03-28T15:57:19	BlobertP joanwalsh @iamdanielsj tokyovampires yeah 22.9% is the actual White population as people normally define that term
MattBruenig	714480703250046977	2016-03-28T15:54:08	MattBruenig @iamdanielsj BlobertP joanwalsh tokyovampires this is how the classification works, hispanic + race 
MattBruenig	714480124683501570	2016-03-28T15:51:50	@iamdanielsj BlobertP joanwalsh tokyovampires yes there is, I will produce an actual rundown from raw census microdata this week
MattBruenig	714478785274503169	2016-03-28T15:46:31	DanteAtkins emilycrockett Thus, they don't need to win 75% or whatever or remaining delegates, only 58% or whatever it is for pledged
MattBruenig	714478643821592576	2016-03-28T15:45:57	DanteAtkins emilycrockett And the way they do that is to say ignore supers right now, look at the pledged. Supers can change.
MattBruenig	714478309392912384	2016-03-28T15:44:37	DanteAtkins emilycrockett Bernie's people talk about supers seems calibrated towards emphasizing they aren't out of it yet.
MattBruenig	714478143306932226	2016-03-28T15:43:58	DanteAtkins emilycrockett Bernie's chance of winning supers if he doesn't win pledged is lower than the chance Hillary is assassinated.
MattBruenig	714478008896192517	2016-03-28T15:43:26	DanteAtkins emilycrockett I am saying I haven't seen any such arg. You sent me a link that didn't show it. So here I am.
MattBruenig	714477006495285248	2016-03-28T15:39:27	DanteAtkins emilycrockett You argue that they should follow pledged and hope you can come back and win them, that's only nonzero chance
MattBruenig	714476794246782977	2016-03-28T15:38:36	DanteAtkins emilycrockett No Dante, when you know the DNC establishment loathes you, you don't bank on them overriding pledged delegates.
MattBruenig	714476374652755969	2016-03-28T15:36:56	DanteAtkins emilycrockett It's anticipating the objection from supers that they need to use their better wisdom to put in a general winner
MattBruenig	714476199439966209	2016-03-28T15:36:14	DanteAtkins emilycrockett you would make that arg in order to counter the arg supers make about why they may need to override voters
MattBruenig	714475050833981442	2016-03-28T15:31:41	emilycrockett DanteAtkins what is the message exactly if not that supers need to come on board if he wins majority of pledged?
MattBruenig	714474892377374720	2016-03-28T15:31:03	DanteAtkins emilycrockett urging supers overall to support Bernie in the event that he wins among voters, like Symone says
MattBruenig	714474480156991489	2016-03-28T15:29:25	DanteAtkins emilycrockett this is consistent with the arg I said is being advanced
MattBruenig	714473702734368768	2016-03-28T15:26:19	DanteAtkins emilycrockett it is
MattBruenig	714473391198109696	2016-03-28T15:25:05	DanteAtkins emilycrockett nobody is serious about supers, but the actual arg is supers should go for whoever gets most natl delegates

MattBruenig	714468627328679937	2016-03-28T15:06:09	@iamdanielsj joanwalsh tokyovampires there are even some hispanic asians, believe it or not
MattBruenig	714468533904793601	2016-03-28T15:05:47	@iamdanielsj joanwalsh tokyovampires the census treats hispanic status as separate from race, all hispanics have some other race in census
MattBruenig	714468128131006465	2016-03-28T15:04:10	joanwalsh @iamdanielsj tokyovampires black latinos = haiti, dominican, etc.; white latinos = basically everyone else
MattBruenig	714467537556213761	2016-03-28T15:01:49	joanwalsh @iamdanielsj tokyovampires almost all Latinos are listed as white in the census, that's why the term "non-hispanic white" exists

MattBruenig	714278834833649664	2016-03-28T02:31:59	MitchSchindler do you mean if it swapped out its sales tax for VAT?
MattBruenig	714278633410576384	2016-03-28T02:31:11	JMVenz depends somewhat on how you do the accounting, OECD puts nontax revenue as 6.6% and total revenue at 33% in 2013
MattBruenig	714277361202642944	2016-03-28T02:26:08	JMVenz nontax revenue is revenue from such things as fees, fines, tolls, govt owned enterprises, etc
MattBruenig	714276359485435904	2016-03-28T02:22:09	bradplumer that would be counted as an excise tax, different from sales/VAT

MattBruenig	713450795757387776	2016-03-25T19:41:39	itsRodT It's his whole schtick. In any case, I was repeating an argument Kobra had made. I said I disagree with it.
MattBruenig	713450675074699265	2016-03-25T19:41:10	itsRodT I mean he pushes and has pushed the policies usually called egalitarian socdem policies for many decades.
MattBruenig	713449612699418624	2016-03-25T19:36:57	PEdwards980 RBReich alv9n though he indicates that in the piece
MattBruenig	713449541765345280	2016-03-25T19:36:40	PEdwards980 RBReich alv9n It's based on TPC numbers. The main communication problem with it is that it doesn't include benefit side.
MattBruenig	713449067272093699	2016-03-25T19:34:47	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer lot of evidence supporting it, not hard to test, you just ask ppl year over year

MattBruenig	713448490077200384	2016-03-25T19:32:29	Maarblek smoothkobra CarlBeijer right, he doesn't stick to the argumentative thread very well, point is politics don't change with age

MattBruenig	713444039236984837	2016-03-25T19:14:48	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer In reality, his black support has gone up and up over time, though not enough ultimately
MattBruenig	713443920164876288	2016-03-25T19:14:20	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer just a particularly striking counter to this claim that is very false 
MattBruenig	713441463758098432	2016-03-25T19:04:34	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer Bit of a digression. Check this graph out for 18-29 blacks over time 
MattBruenig	713440686163550208	2016-03-25T19:01:29	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer but it started at like 5%
MattBruenig	713440587857469440	2016-03-25T19:01:05	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer granted that's starting from a very low base on account that he was a total unknown
MattBruenig	713440504264978434	2016-03-25T19:00:45	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer that's not true, his black support (and his support generally) has just gone up and up and up
MattBruenig	713440408500576257	2016-03-25T19:00:23	vijdas also this 
MattBruenig	713440222269280256	2016-03-25T18:59:38	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer Your argument is that black voters didn't support bernie because black voters didn't support bernie
MattBruenig	713440056250392576	2016-03-25T18:58:59	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer right, but you see the brain-tickling logical misstep here, I assume
MattBruenig	713439826364735489	2016-03-25T18:58:04	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer that decision *decides* who has a more/less white coalition, it can't be *based* on who does
MattBruenig	713439513301876737	2016-03-25T18:56:49	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer I mean both candidates have an all white coalition prior to nonwhites decision of who to support
MattBruenig	713438552361680896	2016-03-25T18:53:00	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer (says you; to be clear, I don't believe that based on the data I've seen)
MattBruenig	713438477132701697	2016-03-25T18:52:42	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer right, so they just oppose good social welfare policies unrelated to your "poor white coalition" stuff
MattBruenig	713438167290884096	2016-03-25T18:51:28	The MattBruenig Election Team would like to put to rest the rumors that our VP of Human Resources had an affair with GOP candidate Ted Cruz
MattBruenig	713438271678902272	2016-03-25T18:51:53	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer Now the argument is a pure electability play. We just spent 20 minutes of you arguing something else.
MattBruenig	713438120428118016	2016-03-25T18:51:17	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer You notice your arguments keep shifting right?
MattBruenig	713437979121987584	2016-03-25T18:50:43	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer They look at single-payer and are like "this, I don't like this at all."
MattBruenig	713437819679686661	2016-03-25T18:50:05	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer It's that, in your view, blacks also oppose "super progressive" policies just on the merits?
MattBruenig	713437694676709376	2016-03-25T18:49:36	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer Alright. So the issue here is not this weird poor white coalition thing you keep talking about.
MattBruenig	713437282229989377	2016-03-25T18:47:57	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer That's the Clinton coalition after all. Rich whites who oppose universal welfare and blacks.
MattBruenig	713437114898194432	2016-03-25T18:47:17	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer How is that more impossible than being in a coalition with rich whites who also oppose the programs?
MattBruenig	713436683103027200	2016-03-25T18:45:34	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer no, it's asking blacks to vote *against* the wishes of poor whites
MattBruenig	713436302872559617	2016-03-25T18:44:04	smoothkobra CarlBeijer Maarblek So imagine we switch Sanders and Clinton's platforms, do you think Blacks would go for Sanders?
MattBruenig	713435772335030272	2016-03-25T18:41:57	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer the strategy of voting against the same policies most poor whites oppose on racist grounds is well odd.
MattBruenig	713435667796258816	2016-03-25T18:41:32	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer Like "take that poor whites, we got universal health care even though you don't think I deserve it"
MattBruenig	713435570463252480	2016-03-25T18:41:09	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer I am saying you can get back at them by getting those programs and rubbing their faces in it.
MattBruenig	713435322676350976	2016-03-25T18:40:10	smoothkobra CarlBeijer Maarblek Do you think Clinton would have done worse with blacks if she had run on Sanders platform?
MattBruenig	713435223913009152	2016-03-25T18:39:47	smoothkobra CarlBeijer Maarblek Personality meaning based on her personally and the Clinton brand, rather than politics per se.
MattBruenig	713434963232817152	2016-03-25T18:38:44	smoothkobra Maarblek CarlBeijer You know what you should do is get back at the poor whites by voting for egalitarianism!
MattBruenig	713434638312718336	2016-03-25T18:37:27	smoothkobra CarlBeijer Maarblek That seems a little unlikely but who knows. Many thing Clinton support is very personality driven.
MattBruenig	713434494653579264	2016-03-25T18:36:53	smoothkobra CarlBeijer Maarblek Bigger worry is that the Sanders support may be personality-driven rather than politics-driven.
MattBruenig	713434338705162240	2016-03-25T18:36:15	smoothkobra CarlBeijer Maarblek right, it's not necessarily true, but studies show it's typically true people's politics stay same
MattBruenig	713433933287960576	2016-03-25T18:34:39	smoothkobra CarlBeijer Maarblek That seems unlikely to me. It may fit your perspective as an upper class person though.
MattBruenig	713433858612576256	2016-03-25T18:34:21	smoothkobra CarlBeijer Maarblek So you think blacks oppose egalitarian politics because they don't want to help poor whites?
MattBruenig	713433532744474628	2016-03-25T18:33:03	smoothkobra CarlBeijer Maarblek I worry about that coalition though. Part of me feels like their interests are very much at odds.
MattBruenig	713433311926951936	2016-03-25T18:32:11	smoothkobra CarlBeijer Maarblek I think the age demos suggest otherwise. But it's possible the rich whites + blacks coalition can hold on
MattBruenig	713433160873340928	2016-03-25T18:31:35	smoothkobra CarlBeijer Maarblek again maybe you are right and we will continue to have enormous poverty forever
MattBruenig	713432764058615808	2016-03-25T18:30:00	smoothkobra CarlBeijer Maarblek But who knows. Perhaps coalition of rich whites and blacks can block egalitarianism in Dem party forever
MattBruenig	713432467110293506	2016-03-25T18:28:49	smoothkobra CarlBeijer Maarblek People disagree on mechanics here. Young black voters go for Sanders. Many say Clinton sui generis.

MattBruenig	712301388626313216	2016-03-22T15:34:19	ticketdust JoshuaMound Econ_Marshall jeffspross Will it be a lib description that pretends its "earned" or leftist "solidarity"
MattBruenig	712301161227948039	2016-03-22T15:33:25	ticketdust JoshuaMound Econ_Marshall jeffspross We will get paid leave at some point in the US. How its described will set the tone.
MattBruenig	712301063416762369	2016-03-22T15:33:02	ticketdust JoshuaMound Econ_Marshall jeffspross i think it does, depends on your willingness to describe popular programs that way
MattBruenig	712300118486216704	2016-03-22T15:29:16	JoshuaMound ticketdust Econ_Marshall jeffspross anyways welfare state values are equality and solidarity, anathema to libs but still
MattBruenig	712298808609263617	2016-03-22T15:24:04	JoshuaMound ticketdust Econ_Marshall jeffspross absolutely and don't you dare insist they are mooching during leave when they are!
MattBruenig	712297993135919105	2016-03-22T15:20:50	JoshuaMound ticketdust Econ_Marshall jeffspross As people have kids early in career and cannot possibly "pay in" before they get out
MattBruenig	712297871433977856	2016-03-22T15:20:21	JoshuaMound ticketdust Econ_Marshall jeffspross Dems insist it must be an "earned benefit" which is just literally not possible
MattBruenig	712297626914390016	2016-03-22T15:19:22	JoshuaMound ticketdust Econ_Marshall jeffspross yes, paid leave rhetoric right now is a perfect example of that by the way

MattBruenig	712296080122224640	2016-03-22T15:13:13	JoshuaMound ticketdust Econ_Marshall jeffspross leads people to conclude things about necessity of "earned benefit" that isn't true
MattBruenig	712295994432602114	2016-03-22T15:12:53	JoshuaMound ticketdust Econ_Marshall jeffspross anyways, i think the "earned" stuff in US is mainly function of US welfare gerontocracy
MattBruenig	712295760965070850	2016-03-22T15:11:57	JoshuaMound ticketdust Econ_Marshall jeffspross which is still a huge unearned welfare benefit!
MattBruenig	712295714014044161	2016-03-22T15:11:46	JoshuaMound ticketdust Econ_Marshall jeffspross do they? maybe secretly, but publicly, it's about universal vouchers

MattBruenig	712295381900632064	2016-03-22T15:10:27	JoshuaMound ticketdust Econ_Marshall jeffspross usually "earned" benefits also have minimums that you can get regardless
MattBruenig	712295116996788224	2016-03-22T15:09:24	ticketdust JoshuaMound Econ_Marshall jeffspross the only universal child benefit the US has is K-12 and nobody wants to get rid of it

MattBruenig	712294421702832129	2016-03-22T15:06:38	JoshuaMound ticketdust Econ_Marshall jeffspross Some adult benefits are seen as earned (unemployment, disability), others not (leave).
MattBruenig	712294215657644032	2016-03-22T15:05:49	JoshuaMound ticketdust Econ_Marshall jeffspross Nobody talks about child benefits as earned. See child care, education, cash benefit.
MattBruenig	712294092147978242	2016-03-22T15:05:20	JoshuaMound ticketdust Econ_Marshall jeffspross Nobody talks about full life benefits as earned. See universal health care.
MattBruenig	712294019838119936	2016-03-22T15:05:02	JoshuaMound ticketdust Econ_Marshall jeffspross There are roughly four kinds of benefits: 1. Child 2. Adult 3. Elderly 4. Full life
MattBruenig	712292988492357632	2016-03-22T15:00:56	JoshuaMound ticketdust Econ_Marshall jeffspross see k-12, student benefits, and elsewhere childcare and child allowance
MattBruenig	712292683109236736	2016-03-22T14:59:44	JoshuaMound ticketdust Econ_Marshall jeffspross not so for younger people and nobody justifies them that way.
MattBruenig	712292442234621953	2016-03-22T14:58:46	JoshuaMound ticketdust Econ_Marshall jeffspross this is mainly a lifecycle thing. Benefits for older ppl can be played up as earned.

MattBruenig	711968842457751553	2016-03-21T17:32:54	freddiedeboer armandjeff yeah though maybe should think of internet like addiction and so like saying people who want to stop drinking can

MattBruenig	711966445392039938	2016-03-21T17:23:22	armandjeff freddiedeboer in truth you only remember a few things from a book anyhow, especially after awhile

MattBruenig	711963316135051264	2016-03-21T17:10:56	rev_avocado smoothkobra of course not, my point  was libs often dismiss low class whites, seem to hate them; kobra disagreed
MattBruenig	711962731642032129	2016-03-21T17:08:37	rev_avocado smoothkobra So income-based definitions tend to create strange sorting where older blue collar worker &gt; young college degree
MattBruenig	711962531854733314	2016-03-21T17:07:49	rev_avocado smoothkobra there is a temptation to use income some times, but problem is income changes a lot across career (goes up)
MattBruenig	711962314631725056	2016-03-21T17:06:58	rev_avocado smoothkobra I was using college degree to define that, which is a common approach.
MattBruenig	711962172256088064	2016-03-21T17:06:24	rev_avocado smoothkobra Obviously the answer is class and race operate on a gradient, but that means can't dismiss plight of poor whites
MattBruenig	711962005134032896	2016-03-21T17:05:44	rev_avocado smoothkobra Doesn't downplay it. The thread was instigated by claim that poor whites &gt; rich nonwhites, which downplays class.
MattBruenig	711961532813479936	2016-03-21T17:03:51	rev_avocado smoothkobra overall I mean, outside of wealth, I don't know of any indicators showing upper class blacks &lt; lower class whites
MattBruenig	711960272328593409	2016-03-21T16:58:51	rev_avocado smoothkobra so what is your take on that question
MattBruenig	711960229030850560	2016-03-21T16:58:40	rev_avocado smoothkobra on most indicators of well-being the answer is definitely no, but obviously this involves some judgment calls
MattBruenig	711960060289753088	2016-03-21T16:58:00	rev_avocado smoothkobra Well the question of this thread was specifically whether lower class whites &gt; upper class nonwhites
MattBruenig	711959410206232577	2016-03-21T16:55:25	rev_avocado smoothkobra of course, but who is more often dealing w/ police, black doctors, or poor whites? incarceration stats say latter
MattBruenig	711958910870093824	2016-03-21T16:53:26	rev_avocado smoothkobra everyone knows that *within classes* whites are better off, but topic is whether poor whites &gt; rich blacks
MattBruenig	711958731039383553	2016-03-21T16:52:43	rev_avocado smoothkobra they aren't comparable, one is more than 3x as rich!
MattBruenig	711958154062536706	2016-03-21T16:50:26	rev_avocado smoothkobra which would you say is better off? the family with $100k or $30k given they live in identical neighborhoods?
MattBruenig	711957661491830784	2016-03-21T16:48:28	smoothkobra I wrote that piece. And I wrote the follow up explaining theories of why  (basically income/inheritance)
MattBruenig	711956741093728257	2016-03-21T16:44:49	smoothkobra You brought up employment, that's why I shared that. Same reason I brought up incarceration in response to criminal justice
MattBruenig	711955952879140864	2016-03-21T16:41:41	smoothkobra In all of these indicators poor white &gt; poor black. But question was whether poor white &gt; rich black. Most indicators say no.
MattBruenig	711955363218767872	2016-03-21T16:39:20	smoothkobra This is true. Wealth is one of the indicators where race overwhelms class.
MattBruenig	711955126383210496	2016-03-21T16:38:24	smoothkobra No. Graph shows HS Whites at around 68%, College Blacks at around 82%.
MattBruenig	711954359597268992	2016-03-21T16:35:21	smoothkobra here's employment rate by race+class, same pattern 
MattBruenig	711953971934535680	2016-03-21T16:33:49	keplermessiah smoothkobra libs apply that paragraph to poor whites only, conservatives to poor blacks (sometimes to poor whites too)
MattBruenig	711953683601297408	2016-03-21T16:32:40	keplermessiah smoothkobra but not poor blacks right? this same paragraph when written about poor blacks is definitely false?
MattBruenig	711953488805281794	2016-03-21T16:31:53	Riktigheten smoothkobra poor people of all races barely vote in reality
MattBruenig	711953353568350209	2016-03-21T16:31:21	smoothkobra which is to say lower class whites are 4.2x times as likely to be incarcerated in their twenties as upper class blacks
MattBruenig	711952850381893632	2016-03-21T16:29:21	smoothkobra lower class whites are far more likely to be incarcerated than upper class nonwhites 
MattBruenig	711951946807115776	2016-03-21T16:25:46	smoothkobra do you think lower class whites are more privileged than upper class nonwhites?
MattBruenig	711951167211880448	2016-03-21T16:22:40	smoothkobra the individual who wrote that paragraph hates them
MattBruenig	711949979141672960	2016-03-21T16:17:57	smoothkobra right so your position isn't that nobody hates poor whites, it's that the hate is justified, they really are bad
MattBruenig	711949241451675653	2016-03-21T16:15:01	smoothkobra "destructive lifestyle", "rejection of education", "blame other people for their problems"
MattBruenig	711949018797056000	2016-03-21T16:14:08	smoothkobra except for the last sentence, this paragraph is exactly the same as what racists say about the black lower class
