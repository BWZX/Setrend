oddballstocks	696373118399434752	2016-02-07T16:41:04	Valuetrap13 prime1133 not all investors are in that position. But if your a finance prof the lessons apply
oddballstocks	696372920361287680	2016-02-07T16:40:16	Valuetrap13 prime1133 which applies if you build a business that relies on public quotes (asset mgmt)
oddballstocks	696370140066279425	2016-02-07T16:29:13	Valuetrap13 prime1133 right. And public investors suffer. A business with internally generated cash can be opportunistic
oddballstocks	696369817469784065	2016-02-07T16:27:57	Valuetrap13 prime1133 low price == bad. High price == good. That is the devils bargain you accept in being public
oddballstocks	696369656265838592	2016-02-07T16:27:18	Valuetrap13 prime1133 right. There is a weird psychology in being public that perception works both ways
oddballstocks	696369415697403906	2016-02-07T16:26:21	Valuetrap13 because it's true. You could find investors and leverage yourself to buy a company and suddenly the valuation/math is the same
oddballstocks	696369038491062272	2016-02-07T16:24:51	Valuetrap13 just because you don't have enough capital to control some thing doesn't mean that something changes form
oddballstocks	696368916046733312	2016-02-07T16:24:22	Valuetrap13 and if you have enough capita you can always take it over and keep 100% of profit for yourself
oddballstocks	696368267741544448	2016-02-07T16:21:47	Valuetrap13 bigger companies just need more money. Although even 5-10% positions can influence mgmt at large caps
oddballstocks	696368109633064960	2016-02-07T16:21:09	Valuetrap13 right. Yet 75% is often still better than private. If private you own 100% of earnings at 1x earnings. Public has some multiple
oddballstocks	696367455229382656	2016-02-07T16:18:33	Valuetrap13 and suddenly be quoted, you could buy shares but it would be no different than now. It's the influence one has
oddballstocks	696367313927462913	2016-02-07T16:18:00	Valuetrap13 I have stock in my private biz, exact same as public but no quotes and I own 100%. I could IPO this structure
oddballstocks	696367052739776512	2016-02-07T16:16:57	Valuetrap13 it's definitely ownership. But you need to hit a tipping point for control
