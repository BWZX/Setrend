emilynussbaum	721876587898105856	2016-04-18T01:42:45	twyodor Viewer, she married him.

emilynussbaum	721837541654204421	2016-04-17T23:07:35	ahhensel That's worse. I did like that she spoke back to the boos, regardless.
emilynussbaum	721836174004850688	2016-04-17T23:02:09	ahhensel You mean when she talked about her daughter? It was an odd reaction for sure.

emilynussbaum	721831136503209984	2016-04-17T22:42:08	docholidayyy Look, I was there, this was my reaction. Giving the benefit of the doubt doesn't mean having no observations or opinions.
emilynussbaum	721830166507491329	2016-04-17T22:38:17	docholidayyy Yes &amp; that's what I'm saying: booing someone as they are endorsing your candidate is not giving them the benefit of the doubt.
emilynussbaum	721829889083633664	2016-04-17T22:37:11	docholidayyy She IS a woman, I wasn't emphasizing it, just describing what was happening. And I personally did find it creepy. YMMV.
emilynussbaum	721829620086083584	2016-04-17T22:36:07	docholidayyy It was all of it: she opened by explaining that as good a candidate as Hil was, BS was better. They were linked thoughts.
emilynussbaum	721827304058564608	2016-04-17T22:26:54	docholidayyy Sure, if he'd said she was qualified &amp; inspired his daughter to think a woman could be prez, but BS was better. Still creepy.
emilynussbaum	721826066835369984	2016-04-17T22:21:59	It felt as much as if they were booing Kohn for expressing this complex take as they were booing Hil. It was a quick moment though.
emilynussbaum	721825767454351362	2016-04-17T22:20:48	To those not getting why boos were creepy: SK was ENDORSING Sanders. Said Hil's a good candidate, inspiring her daughter, but Bern's better.

emilynussbaum	721821593266176000	2016-04-17T22:04:13	biencalabro No idea. It wasn't from people around me, it was from up in the front.

emilynussbaum	721814757045624834	2016-04-17T21:37:03	One striking thing about his speech is that he basically doesn't talk about Obama at all. It's a big rhetorical difference b/n him &amp; Hil.
emilynussbaum	721813818167402496	2016-04-17T21:33:19	tammyinlalaland I'm a Hil voter but ya gotta be fair: few stump speeches get super-granular. I do agree that's a big issue with him.
emilynussbaum	721813075192586242	2016-04-17T21:30:22	Because it was irresistibly convenient, I just attempted to feel the Bern at his rally in Prospect Park. He did give a v inspiring speech.

emilynussbaum	721403666801041408	2016-04-16T18:23:31	gausswerks It's more that he doesn't draw key distinctions: not saying M Daisey should be harassed, but he's not analogous to Monica L.

emilynussbaum	720791386862329857	2016-04-15T01:50:32	Hmm, I can feel a weird undertow of them wanting to agree on things. This is kind of like when Alicia Florrick ran against Niles Crane.

emilynussbaum	720783993570988032	2016-04-15T01:21:10	RussTop3Ever Maybe, but in this case, that's what HE was doing, that's all. He just ignored the question &amp; repeated his talking point.
emilynussbaum	720783752528601090	2016-04-15T01:20:12	RussTop3Ever It's not bias, it's a fact: he was asked for a Hil act that was corrupted by bank $. He just said "she gave speeches."

emilynussbaum	718422576821899264	2016-04-08T12:57:44	brittseegers I thought that was odd too. I mean, to me, that was part of the power of the show, the "we own/transform this history" aspect.

emilynussbaum	715214600858378242	2016-03-30T16:30:23	This is true for some other channels too. It's just realistic that a good streaming screener site encourages folks to write abt your shows.

emilynussbaum	714880094846730241	2016-03-29T18:21:11	MHourback From my POV, I honestly think he'd get crushed on much of this. But it is true that the dynamic is unpredictable.

emilynussbaum	714877776025796612	2016-03-29T18:11:58	MHourback He's definitely polling well, but before any attacks. Other ppl know more than me about how much of an effect indie votes have.

emilynussbaum	713895518859079680	2016-03-27T01:08:49	emilynussbaum but it was striking that even for a biracial performer, there is such a narrow range of looks allowed on TV &amp; in movies.

emilynussbaum	713563996792729600	2016-03-26T03:11:28	sackobooks Yes, it does use a parallel plot. But it goes in different directions &amp; I think the 2 complement one another. It's not a ripoff.

emilynussbaum	712810323976273920	2016-03-24T01:16:39	BastardMachine Yeah, we're just opposites on that. I *loved* it. Her absence throbbed through every scene. It elevated the finale for me.

emilynussbaum	707965770639269889	2016-03-10T16:26:07	bgporter jaclynf I miss her writing so much. She's what's missing right now.

emilynussbaum	707957097930100737	2016-03-10T15:51:40	InSurprise caitrionambalfe It was a joke following on a tweet about American Crime Story.
emilynussbaum	707952865554341889	2016-03-10T15:34:50	Lectify1 It's okay. It's a pet peeve. Sorry if that was... chidey?
emilynussbaum	707952790228828160	2016-03-10T15:34:32	Lectify1 From my POV, it was central to the original material &amp; couldn't be skirted. I'm basically fine with how they handled it.
emilynussbaum	707951212390457344	2016-03-10T15:28:16	Lectify1 Also, I haaate the word "rapey." Some shows deal with rape well, some badly, some shows are about coercion, but none are "rapey."
emilynussbaum	707950908840288256	2016-03-10T15:27:04	Lectify1 I definitely understand the concerns people would have with the Jamie rape episode. But I think the aftermath is taken seriously.
emilynussbaum	707950741139415040	2016-03-10T15:26:24	Lectify1 There's nothing homophobic about the show, I literally don't understand that argument. Rape is central to the world it's in.
emilynussbaum	707942008917270528	2016-03-10T14:51:42	Awesome news.

emilynussbaum	707797731226607619	2016-03-10T05:18:24	I love Younger but I do wish it had a completely crazy credits sequence which told the backstory a la The Nanny or Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.
emilynussbaum	707794507316727808	2016-03-10T05:05:35	sp0ka Really? It's incoherent and nihilistic, yet groovy.
emilynussbaum	707793983871819777	2016-03-10T05:03:30	slb79 At first, I thought you were saying that that was your facial expression reacting to the recap or the headline!
emilynussbaum	707793220584001540	2016-03-10T05:00:28	milkud22 I was riffing off American Crime and American Crime Story. But there's certainly plenty of crime on the show.
emilynussbaum	707792029946929154	2016-03-10T04:55:44	A good, hip, confusing slogan would be "Bern Down For What?"

emilynussbaum	707787269520936960	2016-03-10T04:36:49	tromano Seems like it, yeah!
emilynussbaum	707787100951805952	2016-03-10T04:36:09	tromano AND I feel guilty for not getting to Underground. Or Hap &amp; Leonard. Or whatever new episodes there are of that Louie show.
emilynussbaum	707786480941441024	2016-03-10T04:33:41	tromano Oh my god: I forgot. I also watched the final three episodes of OJ! Wow, I do watch a lot of television. Who knew.
emilynussbaum	707786331745861632	2016-03-10T04:33:06	tromano I'm also caught up on blackish, plus semi- on FotB &amp; Goldbergs. And Broad City, I also watched one of those. i watched a lot.
emilynussbaum	707785956120780800	2016-03-10T04:31:36	tromano I'm torn about watching more, bc I'm not actually that into the show. I also watched Scandal: I always watch Scandal. &amp; Younger.
emilynussbaum	707785745566666752	2016-03-10T04:30:46	tromano I read when I walk, so that helps!
emilynussbaum	707785649814949888	2016-03-10T04:30:23	nancysan tromano I was comfortable with not watching the end of Downton Abbey. &amp; I haven't watched any of S2 of Better Call Saul.
emilynussbaum	707785292728705030	2016-03-10T04:28:58	tromano I have a lot of reading/transcribing/writing to do, so I have a pile of screeners I haven't gotten to. It's all triage.
emilynussbaum	707785134712475648	2016-03-10T04:28:20	tromano This week I watched 6 HoC, 3 Outlanders, rewatched The Middle (which I wrote about), plus TGW, JtV, CrazyEx, Fosters, some others.
emilynussbaum	707783502293573632	2016-03-10T04:21:51	tromano I honestly haven't counted! I go on odd binges &amp; inappropriately keep watching shows I like but already reviewed (like Crazy ExG.)
emilynussbaum	707783163418910721	2016-03-10T04:20:30	tromano A lot, but not constant. I need to read, eat &amp; wave to my kids from the sofa. Plus write, which is the actual job.
emilynussbaum	707782869503049730	2016-03-10T04:19:20	aegallagher The reason I didn't review it was that ABC's wonky screener system threw me off, so I delayed it. Then fell behind, dammit.
emilynussbaum	707782433194819585	2016-03-10T04:17:36	I did watch 3 episodes of Scottish Sex-Crime Story (aka Outlander) and I'm obsessed all over again. More people should watch this.
emilynussbaum	707781874064687104	2016-03-10T04:15:23	tbake7 Not American Crime Story: American Crime! On ABC. I'm caught up on ACS &amp; wrote about it. (Psst, TV, maybe some new titles.)
emilynussbaum	707780763807322115	2016-03-10T04:10:58	Nice having Spy's 7 years exposing &amp; ridiculing realDonaldTrump noted. But sometimes feels like we tried but failed to kill Baby Hitler.
emilynussbaum	707780098892689408	2016-03-10T04:08:20	There is always one television show I feel terrible about not being caught up on. At the moment, it's American Crime.
emilynussbaum	707772244320247808	2016-03-10T03:37:07	BobbyJDaniels But after I saw E4, I realized it must be the scene with the earrings. Either way, it was an interesting moment.
emilynussbaum	707772131640221696	2016-03-10T03:36:40	BobbyJDaniels they were filming a scene that touched on the issue, but weren't specific: I assumed it was likely the co-op scene.
emilynussbaum	707771982130094082	2016-03-10T03:36:04	BobbyJDaniels It's funny because I asked them about appropriation last year when we did a panel together &amp; they'd said that...
emilynussbaum	707771817671442432	2016-03-10T03:35:25	BobbyJDaniels Yeah, I saw that episode after my piece had already closed! (They only sent me the first three.)
emilynussbaum	707766356146561024	2016-03-10T03:13:43	mzappitello Okay, cool. It was more of a joke, really—my central philosophy is that no one has the right to judge without seeing something!
emilynussbaum	707765904667492352	2016-03-10T03:11:55	mzappitello This is based on Twitter, like I said. For all I know, it's a penetrating debate full of Noel Coward ripostes &amp; revelation.
emilynussbaum	707765628489342976	2016-03-10T03:10:50	mzappitello Because it sounds like it's all email, likeability, speeches &amp; Benghazi, rather than issues. (No debate ?s on abortion, ever.)
emilynussbaum	707764221296168961	2016-03-10T03:05:14	I'm not even watching the debate but I'm still annoyed at the moderators.
emilynussbaum	707754040734703616	2016-03-10T02:24:47	jbouie I’m not watching the debate but you’re cracking me up.

emilynussbaum	707738823950770176	2016-03-10T01:24:19	sfmnemonic SlAmrit On Scandal, they actually reflected the aftermath: Huck was irrevocably damaged. 24 had more of a bounce-back problem.
emilynussbaum	707737876788805632	2016-03-10T01:20:33	sfmnemonic SlAmrit I will say that screaming YOLO was darkly hilarious. But yeah.
emilynussbaum	707737682236014592	2016-03-10T01:19:47	sfmnemonic SlAmrit I still think it was a mistake, not as subject matter, but the way it got eroticized. The 24 problem.
emilynussbaum	707737444775493633	2016-03-10T01:18:50	sfmnemonic SlAmrit I feel the same about the torture. It's the one thing that really bothered me about the show, but it's eased off.
emilynussbaum	707666118979276801	2016-03-09T20:35:25	SlAmrit You and I are just Scandal opposite-fans!
emilynussbaum	707665974917517313	2016-03-09T20:34:50	ddiamond She’s a lunatic but she has a point on this one show.
emilynussbaum	707665762056597505	2016-03-09T20:34:00	SlAmrit Felt like a more conventional procedural with House-like genius boss &amp; romance. Then it got *weird*. Love Scandal.
emilynussbaum	707665510901686273	2016-03-09T20:33:00	SlAmrit S1 is the only season I *didn’t* like, though it started taking off into something new &amp; original by the final episodes.
emilynussbaum	707664586502217729	2016-03-09T20:29:19	nancook ddiamond I don’t agree. It’s gone up &amp; down but this season is excellent.
emilynussbaum	707664455304355840	2016-03-09T20:28:48	ddiamond I do get that, but It’s a v different show, sadomasochistic melodrama, not rom-com. Here’s one analysis: 
emilynussbaum	707661379843596288	2016-03-09T20:16:35	ddiamond Scandal. Which basically IS HoC, but with humor, daring and brash poetry.
emilynussbaum	707418116268138497	2016-03-09T04:09:56	peterme I liked it. Rough stuff at the end but I dig the show a lot.
emilynussbaum	707417906565541889	2016-03-09T04:09:06	mollylambert Have you seen Outlander? (It’s not garbage, though, it’s delicious.)
emilynussbaum	707417232998068224	2016-03-09T04:06:26	SPOILER for Outlander S2, so don’t read on if yer WEAK: at some point, a person says “like a PLAID woven out of LIES and DECEPTION.”
emilynussbaum	707413906172612608	2016-03-09T03:53:13	filmguymo moryan I’ve always wanted to write about White Bear specifically. Haven’t found the time.
emilynussbaum	707411440504799233	2016-03-09T03:43:25	WolfandRhys BattyMamzelle Just have low expectations. I truly feel it’s under-rated.
emilynussbaum	707411190520090624	2016-03-09T03:42:25	soniasaraiya moryan The sadism. The cackling voyeurism. “We’ll do worse than water-boarding.”
emilynussbaum	707410967232118784	2016-03-09T03:41:32	BattyMamzelle A lot of people have issues with it. But I think the tenderness of the romantic relationship is key to the story.
emilynussbaum	707409826834489344	2016-03-09T03:37:00	BattyMamzelle Too hard for Twitter, but I thought it had a lot to say abt the psychology/ethics of comedy creators, not just abt politics.
emilynussbaum	707409241632542721	2016-03-09T03:34:40	Relevant Black Mirror episodes: National Anthem, 15 Million Merits, The Waldo Moment, White Bear. H/t moryan
emilynussbaum	707408665582686208	2016-03-09T03:32:23	BattyMamzelle I love Waldo &amp; always defend it. I think it’s smart &amp; moving &amp; has a lot to say.
emilynussbaum	707408281527001088	2016-03-09T03:30:51	moryan I was actually thinking of the parallels to The Waldo Moment.

emilynussbaum	707400470390820865	2016-03-09T02:59:49	RedwoodGirl An equally unnerving after-analysis.
emilynussbaum	707400074977013761	2016-03-09T02:58:15	FINALLY, someone on CNN says something candid: calls Trump's speech "a freak-show infomercial."
emilynussbaum	707399284048715776	2016-03-09T02:55:06	Tonight's OJ episode is excellent. And relevant.
emilynussbaum	707399033279684608	2016-03-09T02:54:07	That was so disturbing I need to watch a reenactment of the OJ Simpson murder trial to relax.

emilynussbaum	707398836705165312	2016-03-09T02:53:20	AlyssaRosenberg Yes. WTF.
emilynussbaum	707397052502843392	2016-03-09T02:46:14	No one heard this. All three cable news networks stayed with Trump. 
emilynussbaum	707395030403649536	2016-03-09T02:38:12	milkud22 Totally. Great ep.
emilynussbaum	707394134521352192	2016-03-09T02:34:39	FlexZuc It popped up after The Fosters ended &amp; I felt obliged to watch a bit. Yikes.
emilynussbaum	707392896484446208	2016-03-09T02:29:43	ajmarechal Well, there's The Americans! Also Jane The Virgin, Crazy Ex-GF, Younger, Outlander, Broad City &amp; a bunch of others.
emilynussbaum	707391936592814081	2016-03-09T02:25:55	JohnHatch237 Fantastic OJ episode tonight, btw. Top-notch.
emilynussbaum	707391804258312192	2016-03-09T02:25:23	noanaaman That was a shockingly great episode. I cried at the divorce poem!
emilynussbaum	707391514247356416	2016-03-09T02:24:14	Watching Trump on TV makes me feel sick. Man, I wish this election were over.
emilynussbaum	707391337679732736	2016-03-09T02:23:32	noanaaman Yeah it's always a strange tangle. I was very relieved when the Catfight School Election ended.
emilynussbaum	707391217999470593	2016-03-09T02:23:03	noanaaman Haha I just saw the preview for the upcoming Romeo &amp; Juliet musical. Muy Smash.
emilynussbaum	707389987931693057	2016-03-09T02:18:10	noanaaman I'm just happy the show has gotten through a few bumpy bits recently. I'm interested in all the plots now.
emilynussbaum	707389261750923264	2016-03-09T02:15:17	noanaaman I chalk it up to his being so depressed &amp; growly over Gabe. I can see the argument for both kinds of dialogue.
emilynussbaum	707388882342584320	2016-03-09T02:13:46	noanaaman But he's not sober, so maybe he's not respectful of the fact that she is. They did kind of spring the whole thing on him.
emilynussbaum	707388701823864832	2016-03-09T02:13:03	noanaaman It was a pretty elaborate plot, you're right. He SHOULD know that she's an addict. It was weird he offered her a drink.
emilynussbaum	707388447162560512	2016-03-09T02:12:03	noanaaman It's not like Brandon, where he'd talk to Stef about sex. Jesus always seemed like the wild card in that progressive house.
emilynussbaum	707388308607922176	2016-03-09T02:11:30	noanaaman Totally! He's a coarse jocky-cocky teen who's currently angry &amp; wounded. I'm sure he rolls his eyes at some of their hippie talk.
emilynussbaum	707387900070117376	2016-03-09T02:09:52	noanaaman You know, I just feel like Ana's sobriety is fragile. I can see that running into her drug-dealing first love would shake her.
emilynussbaum	707387469352845312	2016-03-09T02:08:09	noanaaman I loved the scene where Stef talked about him wanting her to marry a man. He makes sense to me, an ADD teen boy acting out.
emilynussbaum	707387224510300161	2016-03-09T02:07:11	noanaaman This scene where Ana gets high again is pretty devastating.
emilynussbaum	707386338526547968	2016-03-09T02:03:40	The new Fosters' Jesus is really good. I take back all the snark.
emilynussbaum	707385514983333888	2016-03-09T02:00:24	This plot about a girl lying about a kiss with a teacher is so risky. As is the "sex offender list" plot. The Fosters goes everywhere.
emilynussbaum	707384403576672256	2016-03-09T01:55:59	sarekins Heh. Thanks! He really was adorable in that show.
emilynussbaum	707382481692008448	2016-03-09T01:48:20	sarekins Yes, I wrote a column on it.
emilynussbaum	707381653753167872	2016-03-09T01:45:03	Also Jude is the best gay male character on TV next to Cyrus Beene.
emilynussbaum	707380977937551360	2016-03-09T01:42:22	Ah, man. Jude learning about sex online by Googling "two guys sex virginity."
emilynussbaum	707380232790151168	2016-03-09T01:39:24	milkud22 That's next. I have a lot to catch up on.
emilynussbaum	707378955083509760	2016-03-09T01:34:20	bitty_doyle It's a telenovela. Beautiful happiness rarely lasts, that's all.

emilynussbaum	707349705706102784	2016-03-08T23:38:06	I sometimes get Kasich and Kucinich confused, mostly because one sounds like the past tense of the other.

emilynussbaum	705042884102397952	2016-03-02T14:51:37	CraigatPorlock I think the key is that the show is overt about the cynicism but still maintains sympathy for characters on both sides.

emilynussbaum	704704788160778240	2016-03-01T16:28:08	NLScho Give it 2-3 episodes if you have the leeway. It has an oddball style but I think it's genuinely a good, funny, original show.

emilynussbaum	704703289867288576	2016-03-01T16:22:11	NLScho Me too. But this is not in that category: it's an hour-long CW comic musical with big, bouncy, aggressively smart ensemble moves.

emilynussbaum	703339224209219590	2016-02-26T22:01:53	M_Farah I hear you. I do get why people found it glib, I just wanted people to understand the  source material/context.
emilynussbaum	703336025414885378	2016-02-26T21:49:10	JohnMagary It makes sense for a 25 yo blogger not to know the quote. I was just surprised it wasn’t more mob-fact-checked.
emilynussbaum	703335276748398592	2016-02-26T21:46:11	PatinaBends She said something like, "You know, like we are all Berliners, we are all Africans," so I think the context was clear.
emilynussbaum	703334589478150144	2016-02-26T21:43:28	LindsaySpell Other white celebs had been saying some truly bone-headed things, so I think she got pulled into the general phenomenon.
emilynussbaum	703334079375253504	2016-02-26T21:41:26	hoffi_s I just read it as, Just as JFK said, we are all Berliners, I say, African films are for everyone. I get why it tweaked people tho.

emilynussbaum	703332613826723840	2016-02-26T21:35:37	Here's that context: 
emilynussbaum	703332333395513344	2016-02-26T21:34:30	"ich bin ein Berliner" ("we are all Berliners") quote, which I think some younger pop culture writers aren't familiar with.
emilynussbaum	703332090952155142	2016-02-26T21:33:32	You know, re Streep's "Africans" quote: not only was it not about the white panel, ppl seem to be missing that she was riffing off JFK's...

emilynussbaum	703307216032550913	2016-02-26T19:54:41	I mean, Steinem is nearly a saint to me. She's devoted her whole life to this cause in a v pure way. The cause of "treat women as people."
emilynussbaum	703305684499177472	2016-02-26T19:48:36	I wish I actually *liked* Lands End just so I could furiously stop wearing their clothes.
emilynussbaum	703305274636025858	2016-02-26T19:46:58	I'm pretty out-of-proportion mad about Lands End apologizing for featuring GLORIA F'ING STEINEM. Actual steam may have come out of my ears.
emilynussbaum	703303637989244929	2016-02-26T19:40:28	Abbey_Bender I agree. Although she had a better version of that role in Juno, where she was such a stealthy, interesting player.

emilynussbaum	703296263320694784	2016-02-26T19:11:10	juliaprescott Well, civilians should watch what they want. But yeah, I think the rule of 3 is worth it for ambitious but off-putting shows.

emilynussbaum	703295004995928064	2016-02-26T19:06:10	juliaprescott Actually, I know lots of people who were put off by that pilot: Rebecca's wild lability, the music. It's worth three.
emilynussbaum	703294650904387588	2016-02-26T19:04:46	I mean, some key shows require 3 eps to convert you, bc they're doing something NEW &amp; they train your eyes. But life's too short for 4.
