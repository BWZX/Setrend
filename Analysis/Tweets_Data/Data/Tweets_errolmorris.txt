errolmorris	720364386636812289	2016-04-13T21:33:48	Also, at the San Francisco IFF, .
errolmorris	720363828060381184	2016-04-13T21:31:34	Please go see National Bird at the Tribeca Film Festival, 
errolmorris	718113757608550400	2016-04-07T16:30:36	Oscar-winning filmmaker and writer errolmorris is creating a six-part murder series for netflix: 
errolmorris	716036817905139714	2016-04-01T22:57:35	Perhaps glyptodons could have coached us on how to become extinct.
errolmorris	716035304164032512	2016-04-01T22:51:34	Thank God for Lewis Carroll. “I'm so glad I don't like asparagus, because if I did, I should have to eat it––and I can't bear it!"
errolmorris	716033866385997824	2016-04-01T22:45:51	Proud of myself. I just called Kuhn's "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions," "The Origin of the Specious."
errolmorris	716033360037068800	2016-04-01T22:43:50	Tell UChicago Press to get on with my Kuhn book.
errolmorris	716032108515487744	2016-04-01T22:38:52	Just negotiated a new book deal. (On murderers I have known.)
errolmorris	716031259546398720	2016-04-01T22:35:30	Reading about the Korean War. We started it, and then promptly forgot about it.
errolmorris	716030592081666050	2016-04-01T22:32:51	At least, glyptodons were more attentive to their environment. (Of course, they became extinct, so that's a drawback.)
errolmorris	716030158533234688	2016-04-01T22:31:07	Why not repeat the same historical disasters over and over and over again...? At least you're getting practice.
errolmorris	716029794656329729	2016-04-01T22:29:40	Historical amnesia in America...? Not really. It's not historical amnesia over here; it's historical effacement.
errolmorris	709511531738828800	2016-03-14T22:48:25	BELIEVE IT OR NOT. I was reading about Putnam, Ian Hacking, and Glyptodons. (And then word came that Putnam had died. So sad.)
errolmorris	709050950573395968	2016-03-13T16:18:14	errolmorris house hunters 
errolmorris	709378029777260544	2016-03-14T13:57:56	Hilary Putnam died. An exceptional philosopher and human being. (He was unfailingly kind and supportive.)
errolmorris	709052114694250496	2016-03-13T16:22:52	Two tons and five feet tall?! Thank God they're herbivores. (And when they run out of asparagus?)
errolmorris	709050943443230720	2016-03-13T16:18:13	I hope glyptodons respect our democratic values.
errolmorris	709050547559596032	2016-03-13T16:16:38	I think I hear them rooting in the garden.
errolmorris	709050273583468544	2016-03-13T16:15:33	And since glyptodon DNA has been recovered from fossil remains, are we one step closer to bringing the glyptodon back to life?
errolmorris	709049275938947072	2016-03-13T16:11:35	I just can't stop thinking about glyptodons. (Maybe I want to be one.)
errolmorris	709048879271055360	2016-03-13T16:10:00	Did primitive man sleep in a glyptodon shell/carapace?
errolmorris	708336416032428032	2016-03-11T16:58:56	THE LIMITS OF TYPOGRAPHY. Baskerville couldn't save Jeb. (I think the problem was with the exclamation point.)
errolmorris	707581945572696064	2016-03-09T15:00:56	Congratulations to our 2016 film editing fellow EILEEN MEYER (BEST OF ENEMIES)! eileeneditor VidalBuckleyDoc 
errolmorris	706155912810119168	2016-03-05T16:34:24	Every time someone writes "Planned Parenthood," they should write "Healthcare for woman who might not otherwise be able to afford it."
errolmorris	706154834563567616	2016-03-05T16:30:06	Every time someone writes "Obamacare," they should write, "Healthcare for people who might not otherwise be able to afford it."
errolmorris	706153514846789633	2016-03-05T16:24:52	This philtrum thing bothers me. What was Hitler trying to hide...?
errolmorris	706150715757092864	2016-03-05T16:13:44	Still working on my essay. What if Clarence Thomas had been on the Dred Scott court...?
errolmorris	706150477310861312	2016-03-05T16:12:48	Would Donald Trump be willing to build a wall between me and him...?
errolmorris	706150016788930560	2016-03-05T16:10:58	Shakespeare's "the undiscovered country" refers to–– (a) death, (b) Tasmania, (c) Hitler's philtrum. (The correct answer is all three.)
errolmorris	668005462181289984	2015-11-21T09:58:07	Why do people worry so much about what others might think? (Quote from "Real Enemies," Kathryn Olmsted)
errolmorris	668004848273608704	2015-11-21T09:55:41	"Kaczynski was reluctant to engage McVeigh in conversation. A  friendship with a neofascist mass murderer might project the wrong image."
errolmorris	668004149359984640	2015-11-21T09:52:54	Should it be singular? Two bipolar personalities or just one? (The contemplation of the ontology of mental disorders gives me a headache.)
errolmorris	666286816929161216	2015-11-16T16:08:50	I am so grateful. Ben Carson successfully separated my bipolar personalities.
errolmorris	655417715616804864	2015-10-17T16:18:55	OK, you guys. Buy the book.
errolmorris	655417664286892032	2015-10-17T16:18:42	Uh. (A simple principle. All photographs are staged insofar as they decontextualize reality... Or something like that.)
errolmorris	655007000284274689	2015-10-16T13:06:52	Staging, Manipulation and Truth in Photography: Add your voice to the conversation  
errolmorris	655377451904868352	2015-10-17T13:38:55	.errolmorris dealt with this very effectively in Believing Is Seeing: Observations on the Mysteries of Photography 
errolmorris	655140898628575237	2015-10-16T21:58:56	ERROL'S RAZOR. Among competing hypotheses, the one with the stupidest assumptions should be selected.
errolmorris	655140657695170560	2015-10-16T21:57:59	ERROL'S NEW VERSION OF OCCAM'S RAZOR. LET'S CALL IT ERROL'S RAZOR. You should always reason to the stupidest conclusion.
errolmorris	645949348480720896	2015-09-21T13:15:00	READING. Scott Shane's "Objective Troy," a splendid book. (Who has heard of Douglass's "Is it right and wise to kill a kidnapper?")
errolmorris	644971267439747072	2015-09-18T20:28:27	LOOKING FOR COMPARISONS. The Republican debate is like hearing in the 17th century that plague has infected the village next to you.
errolmorris	644505008986177536	2015-09-17T13:35:43	The history of history is the history of the denial of history.  (Wait a second. I'm confused. "Something" must have happened.)
errolmorris	644501826604105728	2015-09-17T13:23:04	History isn't history until someone denies it happened. (More or less.)
errolmorris	644501491399593984	2015-09-17T13:21:44	If a tree falls in a forest, and everybody denies it, then what...?
errolmorris	644501287959072768	2015-09-17T13:20:55	If you deny history often enough, will it disappear? (If memory serves me correctly, GWB did not keep America "safe.")
errolmorris	644500604832714752	2015-09-17T13:18:13	You know there's trouble when Rand Paul is the only candidate who occasionally makes sense.
errolmorris	644500379820912644	2015-09-17T13:17:19	What the hell is wrong with this country? (OK, it's a rhetorical question.)
errolmorris	644500146441482242	2015-09-17T13:16:23	Is that what it will take to make America great again...? (Eliminate Planned Parenthood, Obamacare, and build a wall...?)
errolmorris	644499518981931008	2015-09-17T13:13:54	If the first Republican debate was horrifying; the second was stultifying. (A bunch of evil clowns.)
errolmorris	631198700514230272	2015-08-11T20:21:11	"Get yourself a different woman" Still fascinated by errolmorris's abandoned on Donald Trump film on "Citizen Kane" 
errolmorris	640621185605070849	2015-09-06T20:22:47	You should read every other book for even more context.
errolmorris	640516193644883968	2015-09-06T13:25:35	errolmorris Should I first read the other Jeffrey MacDonald book before yours for context?
errolmorris	640620697883054081	2015-09-06T20:20:51	Feeling listless. (Maybe I should order the Proust comic.)
errolmorris	640620382223888384	2015-09-06T20:19:35	WHAT TOOK ME SO LONG? Propped up in bed reading Anatole Broyard, "Kafka was the rage."
errolmorris	640619140764405760	2015-09-06T20:14:39	SICK UNTO DEATH WITH THAT LONG AGONY. Wait a second, that's Poe. I just have pneumonia.
errolmorris	638128307297320960	2015-08-30T23:16:58	I loved arguing with Oliver Sacks about binocular vision. (He will be missed.)
errolmorris	638125843064029184	2015-08-30T23:07:11	I have gotten too used to existing. (A big mistake.)
errolmorris	638125033223647232	2015-08-30T23:03:58	SHAMELESS SELF-PROMOTION. A good review of a recent book about me,
