allahpundit	709941103059804162	2016-03-16T03:15:23	Bottom line: Hard to see how Trump DOESN'T get to 1,237 from here. Beating Cruz in red states, likely to beat Kasich in blue states.
allahpundit	709939237735550976	2016-03-16T03:07:58	Missouri is close. But if Kasich or Rubio had dropped earlier Cruz would probably win. It's the Trump-Beats-Divided-Field story part 20ish
