poniewozik	726070520622538753	2016-04-29T15:27:56	sepinwall in a way, the season length mandate makes more sense--even if I don't like it--than episode length
poniewozik	726069901698420736	2016-04-29T15:25:28	kenlowery SamuelAAdams I wd say the same for 30 Rock and the similar in tone Kimmy Schmidt
poniewozik	726069338080423936	2016-04-29T15:23:14	sepinwall in any case, I doubt there's one universal best length. Silicon Valley &amp; Veep feel right at a full 30, eg
poniewozik	726069058035134465	2016-04-29T15:22:07	sepinwall we may disagree abt UKS season 2 but many of them were over 30 minutes.
poniewozik	726068701020184578	2016-04-29T15:20:42	carlquintanilla yeah, but that was scheduling strategy--I cited Zucker-sizing in my essay--which is not a factor for Netflix
poniewozik	726068023254245376	2016-04-29T15:18:01	Maybe? But why? No ads, you either subscribe or don't. Maybe it pumps up stock price? (Implies growth potential?) 
poniewozik	726066838434680837	2016-04-29T15:13:18	One size does not fit all. Shorter not automatically better either. There's just a lot of bloat out there. 
poniewozik	726066491955765248	2016-04-29T15:11:56	AlexJamesFitz maybe, but again, does that boost share price? If so, why? Either you subscribe or you don't. No one pays by the minute.
poniewozik	726066125096771584	2016-04-29T15:10:28	JBFlint there's a difference between a creator wanting it and it being longer by fiat. UKS s2 did not benefit, IMHO.
poniewozik	726065199418101760	2016-04-29T15:06:47	Also, why does Netflix even care if an episode is shorter? Are they physically sapping our energy, like the beings in The Matrix?
poniewozik	726064269167628288	2016-04-29T15:03:06	See, here's one Too-Big-TV problem: episodes getting longer because *Netflix* wants it, rather than the creators.

poniewozik	722102633591386112	2016-04-18T16:40:58	SamuelAAdams Yeah, somebody had to be counterpoint--and a lot of the counterpoint did make sense for her character.
poniewozik	722102349771223041	2016-04-18T16:39:50	(That Bow would be more concerned with preserving the kids' optimism, OTOH, did seem entirely fitting with her character.)
poniewozik	722102032891584512	2016-04-18T16:38:35	YMMV, but it struck me odd that someone with Bow's hippie upbringing--tho diff from Dre's--would express such strong faith in the system.
poniewozik	722101682113540096	2016-04-18T16:37:11	Glad to see Tracee Ellis Ross pushed back on Bow's dialogue in "Hope," a slight weak spot in an amazing episode 1/2

poniewozik	709931457976930304	2016-03-16T02:37:04	Meaning: if we assume the GOP will shut Trump out if it is in any way possible, maybe it's premature to assume he's probably the nominee?

poniewozik	705134357388894209	2016-03-02T20:55:06	tmcgev I guess it's Oklahoma.
poniewozik	705133817615482880	2016-03-02T20:52:57	That was our other argument. Is "Rocky Mountain states" a region? What's Utah? It gets ambiguous out in America.  
poniewozik	705133279280758785	2016-03-02T20:50:49	Anyway, let's poll it. Oklahoma is:
poniewozik	705132653247373317	2016-03-02T20:48:19	I admit I'm biased; am from Michigan and the idea of a "Midwest" encompassing everything from Great Lakes to the Rockies seems nuts.
poniewozik	705132311990431745	2016-03-02T20:46:58	My Twitter feed can't agree on it either. FIGURE YOURSELF OUT, OKLAHOMA!

poniewozik	704882156418539521	2016-03-02T04:12:56	@Bird_Upp right--and as if Van Jones is being The Real Racist here.
poniewozik	704881874154491905	2016-03-02T04:11:49	CONGRATULATIONS PRESIDENT RUBIO! 
poniewozik	704881482368749568	2016-03-02T04:10:16	ClaraJeffery my further question though, is does that model go away, or do people just decide there's a special Trump Exception?
poniewozik	704879657322156032	2016-03-02T04:03:00	KBAndersen right now the leading alternative is figure out a way to wrest the nomination &amp; give it to a guy with fewer delegates, so...
poniewozik	704878907426742272	2016-03-02T04:00:02	This is absolutely arresting. And astounding that this--the Klan!--is a political argument in 2016. 
poniewozik	704873692891889664	2016-03-02T03:39:18	Chris Matthews asks Tom DeLay the obv Q:if you take the nom away from the guy w the most delegates, how does that not blow up on the party?
poniewozik	704867898515431428	2016-03-02T03:16:17	So Trump timed it to give a presser at a Presidential-style podium on live broadcast coverage. Whatever else, he knows how to program TV.
poniewozik	704860607141560320	2016-03-02T02:47:19	AdamWho which I why I assumed was why Rubio had (wisely) opted not to--be the last man standing. Was surprised he changed mind
poniewozik	704860315742314496	2016-03-02T02:46:09	SonnyBunch this will never not be funny
poniewozik	704858409699569665	2016-03-02T02:38:35	I did not have "Chris Christie becomes Donald Trump's Smithers" in my pre-election pool.
poniewozik	704856765989576705	2016-03-02T02:32:03	So is it possible that Rubio's attacking Trump ended up helping... Cruz?
poniewozik	704842640467087360	2016-03-02T01:35:55	Ok, but if Rubio wins Minnesota, he still officially becomes the nominee, right?
poniewozik	704842288187498496	2016-03-02T01:34:31	This is hypmotizing  
poniewozik	704836116415913987	2016-03-02T01:10:00	daveweigel unfortunately New York's a closed primary!

poniewozik	704717633376149504	2016-03-01T17:19:11	juanjoarroyo23 soniasaraiya bnowalk Maybe but there were reports they offered to established ppl like Schumer, Poehler, Chris Rock
poniewozik	704714691025756160	2016-03-01T17:07:29	soniasaraiya Yeah, even looking at younger hosts, they didn't offer Jessica Williams (even if she said she ruled herself out)
poniewozik	704711648246931456	2016-03-01T16:55:24	soniasaraiya Yeah, I'm not saying they're right to do so, but do I think it's how networks think? Definitely.
poniewozik	704711354087829504	2016-03-01T16:54:14	soniasaraiya @bnowalk Agreed, it's mind-boggling.
poniewozik	704710594537136128	2016-03-01T16:51:13	soniasaraiya (That said, Comedy Central may have very purposely not wanted someone in the Stewart tradition; his audience was aging a lot.)
poniewozik	704710450236231680	2016-03-01T16:50:38	soniasaraiya I kinda take her word she didn't want to work nightly, but she's definitely working more in the Stewart tradition.

poniewozik	704681203912278020	2016-03-01T14:54:26	A candidate who REALLY said what people were afraid to say would be amazing. "I fear I've wasted my life!" "I'm attracted to Bugs Bunny!"
poniewozik	704679831355703296	2016-03-01T14:48:58	soniasaraiya I knew you were going to say that
poniewozik	704678357305311232	2016-03-01T14:43:07	Unless you're psychic, "He says what everyone's thinking but won't say" is the ultimate unprovable/unrebuttable statement.

poniewozik	704462283607515136	2016-03-01T00:24:31	GoldsteinStreet (like, I'd probably think to compare ATPM with other 70s dramas rather than with Spotlight.)
poniewozik	704461849320935424	2016-03-01T00:22:47	GoldsteinStreet my own tendency is to compare movies more by style/period/sensibility than by subject. ATPM v different in tone, style

poniewozik	704419433004064768	2016-02-29T21:34:14	weareyourfek In any case, obvs I'm biased here, but absurd if any journalistic outlet sees "keeps OTR interview OTR" as a scandal.

poniewozik	704418194388295680	2016-02-29T21:29:19	weareyourfek Who's lambasting? Seriously curious--all I've seen is people calling on Trump to OK the release.
poniewozik	704379571437703169	2016-02-29T18:55:51	soniasaraiya Then again, I think that's why comedy *can* be perfect for it--you can say/imply more in less time. But it's risky, obvs.
poniewozik	704379388146663424	2016-02-29T18:55:07	soniasaraiya Obama had over an hour to lay out the nuances on Maron--and the story became "He said the N word!"

poniewozik	704377854302277632	2016-02-29T18:49:01	Chris Rock seemed partly to make a point Obama has: that you can say 1) racism is real AND 2) there's been change.

poniewozik	704326743088353280	2016-02-29T15:25:55	soniasaraiya agree, but think it was someone mitigated by his making a joke about black people getting shot by cops right after

poniewozik	693517751927848960	2016-01-30T19:34:51	Louis CK dropped "Horace and Pete" Beyonce-style, and I'm thinking how great it'd be for Alan Alda to win an Emmy for an online download.

poniewozik	687697838617313281	2016-01-14T18:08:36	unclegrambo pjrodriguez I mean, total ratings matter if you're doing cultural reporting. But 4M watching free not = 4M paying to watch
poniewozik	687696692309803008	2016-01-14T18:04:02	pjrodriguez ...including skepticism of NBC's self-interested argument that Netflix ratings (if accurate) mean same as an ad-based network's
poniewozik	687696406350577665	2016-01-14T18:02:54	pjrodriguez Yes, I'm a broken record saying journos shouldn't pick up Netflix/Amazon's claims credulously. Just, more skepticism all around
poniewozik	687694972913610752	2016-01-14T17:57:12	pjrodriguez The mistake, which pro journos make too, is ppl try to apply same ratings in same way to very different businesses and purposes

poniewozik	687692655850029056	2016-01-14T17:48:00	Kimma_S I have the same dumb question! I assume users of the app self-report, and for Nielsen, but ratings tech not my strong suit.
poniewozik	687692431664480256	2016-01-14T17:47:07	pjrodriguez He's right, in the same sense they don't for HBO. Ratings matter for some things &amp; not others. For cultural reach, yes.

poniewozik	687690935271030784	2016-01-14T17:41:10	Schwindter Yeah. It should be an apples-to-apples comparison then--does Symphony find 9 million viewers for Blacklist or 1 million?
poniewozik	687690289448927233	2016-01-14T17:38:36	Schwindter LOL, I wasn't picking on your piece, it was just the one news story I had at hand. The question just now occurred to me.

poniewozik	687689821070962688	2016-01-14T17:36:44	IOW, if NBC says those Netflix/Amazon numbers are accurate, surely a good gauge is to have the same outfit measure NBC!

poniewozik	684463559003238400	2016-01-05T19:56:43	Also, the dynamic may be changing: there's so much good TV (so much, period) that there's no need to grade weaker stuff on a curve.
poniewozik	684462892507348992	2016-01-05T19:54:04	(Tho if I had to pick I'd take "warning signal," only bc the incentive structure now is SO geared toward ratifying your readers' passions.)
poniewozik	684462395494916096	2016-01-05T19:52:06	Not sure I agree w tvoti that each critic is an "appreciator" or a "warning signal," but it's a useful concept: 
poniewozik	684425584064237568	2016-01-05T17:25:49	sepinwall soniasaraiya I sure hope the American justice system sticks the landing!
poniewozik	684422425702957056	2016-01-05T17:13:16	soniasaraiya and then there seems to be a passion among some viewers (from what I've seen anyway) to want/need him to be innocent.
poniewozik	684421745810477056	2016-01-05T17:10:34	soniasaraiya I haven't finished the series, but if it believes it has to exculpate him to damn the trial, that's off-base IMHO.
poniewozik	684421431275450368	2016-01-05T17:09:19	Interesting timing w American Crime Story. Always thought possible that OJ was guilty AND police acted shady. 
poniewozik	684420442489262080	2016-01-05T17:05:24	Put another way: guilt doesn't retroactively justify a railroading. All trials should be fair *because* we don't always know who's guilty.
poniewozik	684420112821149696	2016-01-05T17:04:05	I have no idea if Steven Avery's guilty. But "He's guilty" / "The trial was a travesty" is a false dichotomy; both can be true.

poniewozik	684066137760509952	2016-01-04T17:37:31	Tomorrow there is 1) a Shannara series 2) on MTV. Who made 13-year-old me a TV programmer?

poniewozik	683765417366675457	2016-01-03T21:42:33	Armed robbery is a violent crime even if you don't shoot. "Violent" at minimum should apply to an armed group occupying federal property.

poniewozik	683346664179019776	2016-01-02T17:58:35	KateAurthur Memles this is a whole can of worms, but it kinda recommends the LOST approach of not tying up every loose end.
poniewozik	683345906918420480	2016-01-02T17:55:34	KateAurthur Memles i.e., I don't think he owes me a book NOW, I just think he might be better off sometimes saying, "Eh, a wizard did it."

poniewozik	683329090636648448	2016-01-02T16:48:45	KateAurthur I am increasingly sure he'd write better books if forced to finish them early.

poniewozik	682614196257701888	2015-12-31T17:28:01	This concludes the 2015 CincyAwards. It was a great year for risky TV—I could have listed more. Thanks, remaining followers, both of you!
poniewozik	682613930171076608	2015-12-31T17:26:57	UNREAL. The bookend to MR. ROBOT, with a compelling, unbalanced protagonist, was dangerous TV that steered into its own skids. CincyAwards
poniewozik	682613620899840001	2015-12-31T17:25:44	SENSE8. A classic Cincy: ridiculous and confounding, but playful and innovative. It tried to make TV more than it is. CincyAwards
poniewozik	682613094598623232	2015-12-31T17:23:38	MR. ROBOT. Set in the hermetic POV of a righteous madman, it was the year's biggest formal and narrative innovation on cable. CincyAwards
poniewozik	682612922590167040	2015-12-31T17:22:57	Tomato, tomahto. 
poniewozik	682612635141967873	2015-12-31T17:21:49	THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE. An “almost” Cincy, whose execution might someday match its cathedral-like architecture. CincyAwards

poniewozik	682612291955634177	2015-12-31T17:20:27	MAD MEN. One of TV’s greatest series ever and one that never rested; it kept challenging, evolving and taking risks to the end. CincyAwards
poniewozik	682611985154879488	2015-12-31T17:19:14	THE LAST MAN ON EARTH. At its best, this was apocalyptic slapstick with stakes, and the first half-hour was like nothing else. CincyAwards
poniewozik	682611698235092992	2015-12-31T17:18:05	CRAZY EX-GIRLFRIEND. Hilarious, unsettling, erratic—i.e., crazy—this stalker musical’s high notes made it worth the commitment. CincyAwards
poniewozik	682611440188960768	2015-12-31T17:17:04	So without further blah-blah, in alphabetical order, I give you... the 2015 CincyAwards:
poniewozik	682611222827536384	2015-12-31T17:16:12	In short, the CincyAwards are about the idea that ambition and daring are greater virtues than consistency and competence.
poniewozik	682610942014664704	2015-12-31T17:15:05	The CincyAwards is named for HBO’s magnificent failure, JOHN FROM CINCINNATI. It swung big and missed. But it swung—that’s what matters.
