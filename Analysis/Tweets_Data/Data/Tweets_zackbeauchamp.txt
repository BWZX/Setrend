zackbeauchamp	717398600339361792	2016-04-05T17:08:49	So this is a tweet 
zackbeauchamp	717378463125151746	2016-04-05T15:48:48	jeffspross MattBruenig Sure. Gents, I'm going back to writing — I'd be happy to get a beer with both of you to argue about this IRL
zackbeauchamp	717376194467987456	2016-04-05T15:39:47	MattBruenig jeffspross by which i mean, that is astonishingly implausible and contradicted by (again) all available macro evidence
zackbeauchamp	717375917664952320	2016-04-05T15:38:41	MattBruenig jeffspross unless you want to argue that trade with china didn't increase its gdp or create new jobs which ok sure
zackbeauchamp	717375746466062336	2016-04-05T15:38:00	MattBruenig jeffspross i understand that. but they would have less to invest in general because of lower gdp growth absent us purchases
zackbeauchamp	717374936956932096	2016-04-05T15:34:47	jeffspross ethangach Yes. That doesn't mean what you think it means, for reasons Neil_Irwin explains nicely here 
zackbeauchamp	717373882718662656	2016-04-05T15:30:36	jeffspross ethangach No, this is silly. China wasn't "sending services" to the US. It was selling goods in exchange for capital.
zackbeauchamp	717373604896378880	2016-04-05T15:29:30	jeffspross ethangach Yes, which has *grown the Chinese economy by providing it capital and jobs*
zackbeauchamp	717372835996573697	2016-04-05T15:26:26	jeffspross ethangach If the US lost manufacturing jobs in the 1990s due to trade with China, then those jobs had to have gone *to China*
zackbeauchamp	717372129159806979	2016-04-05T15:23:38	jeffspross ethangach contradicted not only by the empirical evidence but also, contra the piece's insinuation, standard trade theory

zackbeauchamp	713025634830839808	2016-03-24T15:32:13	American politics is garbage because, in the midst of a major debate between a liberal and a socialist, only Ted Cruz has referenced Rawls.

zackbeauchamp	712287738079416321	2016-03-22T14:40:05	The AIPAC audience clapped for Trump. But that doesn’t mean they loved him.

zackbeauchamp	712056645145198593	2016-03-21T23:21:48	There's nothing interesting to say about this Cruz speech. It's identical to the last three speeches, down to even some of the jokes

zackbeauchamp	712051007900012544	2016-03-21T22:59:24	To be clear: the substantive of that speech was very dumb. But no more dumb than Ryan or Kasich's boilerplate, boring speeches before.
zackbeauchamp	712050859518074880	2016-03-21T22:58:48	That sound you hear in the press box is everyone furiously rewriting their "Trump flops" pre-writes

zackbeauchamp	712049437766459393	2016-03-21T22:53:09	Trump used to say he'd be "neutral" on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Here's what he's saying now 
zackbeauchamp	712049040335179776	2016-03-21T22:51:35	The AIPAC crowd loudly cheering attacks on Obama and Clinton aren't doing much to make Israel look like a bipartisan issue
zackbeauchamp	712048509994852352	2016-03-21T22:49:28	Remove the Trumpisms from this speech, and the substance could have been given by any of the other Republicans
zackbeauchamp	712047143318659072	2016-03-21T22:44:02	Trump is now warning that Obama might support a UN *imposed* solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict, which is bonkers

zackbeauchamp	712038793705099265	2016-03-21T22:10:52	Ryan's speech is, impossibly, more generic than Kasich's. He's talking about NATO and North Korea! That has *nothing* to do with Israel.
zackbeauchamp	712037970384175106	2016-03-21T22:07:35	Paul Ryan just attributed George Washington's famous "entangling alliances" quote to Thomas Jefferson

zackbeauchamp	712032206613520384	2016-03-21T21:44:41	Like, he's getting all of the terms right, but there's nothing really interesting or new here

zackbeauchamp	710100999923490816	2016-03-16T13:50:46	So there's credibility and there's "credibility." The former is a real thing scholars study, the latter is a made-up pundit fantasy.

zackbeauchamp	709924478042550272	2016-03-16T02:09:19	So far I don't think Trump has cited a single true fact in his speech — except for his sky-high poll numbers
zackbeauchamp	709923194388414464	2016-03-16T02:04:13	"Five deep, and long" — I see we've gotten to the part of the Trump speech where he brags about his penis again

zackbeauchamp	708334648019947525	2016-03-11T16:51:54	MattBruenig plus, we know from the daily beast account that lewandowski confessed to a breitbart reporter who hasn't published the comments
zackbeauchamp	708334375637626880	2016-03-11T16:50:50	MattBruenig that's not really the point, it's that they are publishing articles directly undercutting Michelle's account on flimsy evidence
zackbeauchamp	708332899502718976	2016-03-11T16:44:58	What kind of garbage publication takes the side of someone who physically assaulted one of their reporters? 
zackbeauchamp	708332623056076800	2016-03-11T16:43:52	Breitbart is foully undercutting its own reporter 
zackbeauchamp	708303639098617857	2016-03-11T14:48:41	Fantastic juliaioffe reporting on the credibility myth I discussed yesterday 
zackbeauchamp	708143215661211648	2016-03-11T04:11:13	This, I think, was Rubio's best moment of the night. Probably won't matter though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
zackbeauchamp	708132293102084096	2016-03-11T03:27:49	How does a person look at this and side with these tanks. Unbelievable. 
zackbeauchamp	708129833713160192	2016-03-11T03:18:03	Kasich's account of US foreign policy under Obama is literally incoherent
zackbeauchamp	708127881356939266	2016-03-11T03:10:17	Rubio talking about the opening to Burma is definitely going to be the line that destroys Donald Trump.
zackbeauchamp	708127691942141952	2016-03-11T03:09:32	Yair_Rosenberg It depends on context. When I tweet an article on the subject it's usually fine. A popular debate tweet is different.
zackbeauchamp	708127163690582017	2016-03-11T03:07:26	Aaaaand my mentions now reminded me why you should never tweet in general, but especially never tweet about Israel-Palestine.
zackbeauchamp	708125361536524289	2016-03-11T03:00:17	Rubio just called the West Bank "Judea and Samaria," which is the Israeli right-wing settler term designed to deny Palestinian claims.
zackbeauchamp	708124184996515840	2016-03-11T02:55:36	So again, either Cruz doesn't know what carpet bombing is or he's cynically manipulating words to sound tough (it's the latter).
zackbeauchamp	708124033414352896	2016-03-11T02:55:00	Ted Cruz says we'll never target innocent civilians. He has literally promised to *carpet bomb* people.
zackbeauchamp	708122854110285825	2016-03-11T02:50:19	Marco "let's surveil mosques" Rubio positioning himself as the champion of tolerance is a bit rich
zackbeauchamp	708122558520885253	2016-03-11T02:49:08	Trump says there's a "serious problem of hate." There is — just it's not the Muslims doing the hating.
zackbeauchamp	708120908620177409	2016-03-11T02:42:35	In sort-of defense of Cruz, American protectionism definitely did make the Depression much worse.
zackbeauchamp	708120590138212353	2016-03-11T02:41:19	The problem with this debate isn't that it's focused on substance. It's that the substantive answers being given are idiotic.
zackbeauchamp	708118478612340736	2016-03-11T02:32:56	that was the most low-energy trump attack ever
zackbeauchamp	708117045993340928	2016-03-11T02:27:14	Trump seems to think America has "lost everything" and yet also has troops that basically control the entire world.
zackbeauchamp	708116519989813248	2016-03-11T02:25:09	The longer this night goes on without anyone attacking Trump, the more of a waste of time it becomes.
zackbeauchamp	708116397050560513	2016-03-11T02:24:39	It seems like these debates have two modes: penis references and pointless recitation of talking points.

zackbeauchamp	694914602543505409	2016-02-03T16:05:26	GregDjerejian Realists should take credit for good that Kissinger/Nixon did! The point is they can't disown the bad as "not realist."
zackbeauchamp	694913201092321280	2016-02-03T15:59:52	mchorowitz It's the No True Scotsman fallacy turned into a major part of a theory
zackbeauchamp	694911934836121600	2016-02-03T15:54:50	9) So it's either "we're cool with Kissinger helping slaughter Bangladeshis" or it's Trump. President Ken Waltz isn't an option.
zackbeauchamp	694911484397281280	2016-02-03T15:53:03	8) I bet this partly has to do with realism's actual track record. Do you really want to defend Henry Kissinger snuggling with genocidaires?
zackbeauchamp	694911265869840384	2016-02-03T15:52:11	7) Realists, of all people, should be attuned to that. The irony is palpable.
zackbeauchamp	694911045798912000	2016-02-03T15:51:18	6) Of course, real politics doesn't work like that. You always get imperfect avatars working with political constraints.
zackbeauchamp	694910967902265344	2016-02-03T15:51:00	5) Basically, all ideologies without access to power do this: they say compare their actually-existing opponents to their perfect ideal
zackbeauchamp	694910767284510720	2016-02-03T15:50:12	4) Realists play this double game where they judge liberalism and neoconservatism by results, then say their abstract policy paper is better
zackbeauchamp	694910529576570882	2016-02-03T15:49:15	3) George W. Bush didn't follow neoconservative ideas perfectly (cf, support for Saudi Arabia). He couldn't.
zackbeauchamp	694910341868883968	2016-02-03T15:48:30	2) But it would *never* be purely implemented. It would be deeply, fundamentally corrupted to fit political realities.
zackbeauchamp	694910093427654656	2016-02-03T15:47:31	1) Academic and pundit realists love to say that they could fix American foreign policy, if only it were purely implemented.

zackbeauchamp	690551774457950208	2016-01-22T15:09:07	KevinWGlass JGreenDC Well my premise is that you can't have "these people" without eventually creating something like Trump

zackbeauchamp	690551109174169600	2016-01-22T15:06:28	KevinWGlass JGreenDC scottbix That seems irrelevant here, given that my point is about printing dissenting opinions but rather 1/2
zackbeauchamp	690550842680696832	2016-01-22T15:05:25	KevinWGlass JGreenDC scottbix My point is about institutional conservative organs like NRO tolerating types that enabled Trump rise
zackbeauchamp	690550710719516672	2016-01-22T15:04:53	KevinWGlass JGreenDC scottbix That's not NRO's house opinion, and they organized the symposium 
zackbeauchamp	690549869287616514	2016-01-22T15:01:33	JGreenDC scottbix the premise of the whole edition is that a trump nomination will utterly destroy conservatism
zackbeauchamp	690549094503153664	2016-01-22T14:58:28	8) So NRO's symposium is willfully blind to the that organized conservatism enabled Trump.
zackbeauchamp	690548802072150019	2016-01-22T14:57:18	7) But they're tolerated and even celebrated — despite dragging the party so far into the gutter that Trump's rise became possible.
zackbeauchamp	690548622023196673	2016-01-22T14:56:35	6) If conservatism were seriously about the high-minded ideals NRO says it's about, Erickson-types would have been ejected long ago.
zackbeauchamp	690548395547619329	2016-01-22T14:55:41	5) But it's just a short hop from Erick Erickson to Donald Trump in terms of angry white identity politics.
zackbeauchamp	690548223836991488	2016-01-22T14:55:00	4) The so-called "respectable" conservative movement has mainstreamed voices like these for politically opportunistic reasons.
zackbeauchamp	690548069302013953	2016-01-22T14:54:24	3) Both Erickson and Loesch both explicitly say they're cool with Trump *in the anti-Trump symposium* 
zackbeauchamp	690547711104290816	2016-01-22T14:52:58	2) It prominently features contributions from Dana Loesch and Erick Erickson, both of whom are hard-right demagogues.
zackbeauchamp	690547560612671488	2016-01-22T14:52:22	1) The National Review anti-Trump symposium ends up showing how the GOP establishment enabled Trump's rise.
