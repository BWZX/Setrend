vcutrader	726124540770799618	2016-04-29T19:02:35	Trump media strategy --- fuel the anger of the voter w/ these protests, then pivot back to Bobby Knight lol

vcutrader	726121610739081216	2016-04-29T18:50:57	JimPBurton i really think Cruz's best shot is backing Trump and get a VP or AG job.  Assuming DT loses, 2020 will be Haley &amp; Ryan network

vcutrader	726117764595892224	2016-04-29T18:35:40	NEED TO UPDATE MY MODEL!! 
vcutrader	726095267263602688	2016-04-29T17:06:16	JimPBurton that imo is Trump's biggest threat - not HC.  Pulling off the record popular vote (w/ 16 others in) puts General in his favor
vcutrader	726094317987713025	2016-04-29T17:02:30	JimPBurton never seen a nominee pick a VP and make signs....hopefully desperation and not a gift to Hillary (which the Bush's would love)
vcutrader	726093970355425282	2016-04-29T17:01:07	JimPBurton agree i dont think Cruz is an insider but think his Bush ties are real...i just hope Bush/Romney don't fund 3rd party Cruz/Carly

vcutrader	726092365216243712	2016-04-29T16:54:44	I give Pence a free pass on this one....he had pressure and went on the radio to do it  
vcutrader	726091438107295744	2016-04-29T16:51:03	JimPBurton "insiders" being Pence's crew - calls from donors/PACs to endorse Cruz....but Cruz doesn't know Boehner "never met the man"
vcutrader	726089754740199424	2016-04-29T16:44:22	LOL - Summarized: "I'll vote for Cruz but I love what Donald Trump as done!" 
vcutrader	726088817472589824	2016-04-29T16:40:38	hook910 my fear is not Trump getting nom or even Hillary, it's Cruz/Carly running 3rd party - funded by Bush/Mitt

vcutrader	726087438393827329	2016-04-29T16:35:10	hook910 but the way i read the OH delegate run, if JK drops out, all dels go to Trump, so then again, sets him over bar....Cruz in a box
vcutrader	726087300447358980	2016-04-29T16:34:37	hook910 Cruz has better shot in IN but risk of losing NE if he loses IN...momentum tough to shake. Only shot in CA if JK drops out
vcutrader	726087119739953152	2016-04-29T16:33:54	hook910 96% chance probability Trump gets at least 1,200+ dels is crazy odds...I think he will hit 1,300+
vcutrader	726086986579218433	2016-04-29T16:33:22	hook910 i gotta be honest, i don't see a case where he doesn't hit that...even if short, Kasich is pissed and give deal
vcutrader	726086345920249856	2016-04-29T16:30:49	hook910 could be all garbage like you say, find out Tues but prediction markets have Trump at 75% still- feels like low margin win, no flip
vcutrader	726085826258587649	2016-04-29T16:28:45	hook910 and ARG Trump +9 poll with this on Cruz internals 
vcutrader	726085591977308161	2016-04-29T16:27:49	hook910 just saying, these are the two stories hit the tape today neither from fox (1/2) 
vcutrader	726084402556592128	2016-04-29T16:23:06	hook910 HOWEVER, i think it goes from a +7-10 pt Trump win to +4-6 pts
vcutrader	726084222037950465	2016-04-29T16:22:23	hook910 Cruz internals have him down 8 pts....Trump internals have him at 51% ?
vcutrader	726084079570030592	2016-04-29T16:21:49	hook910 don't see it...think about it this way, if Pence endorsement was to have meaning, why wait until Friday afternoon?

vcutrader	726062135202209793	2016-04-29T14:54:37	With the Pence news hitting the tape, Trump is still over 70% chance to win (incredible) and has only two IN events planned this weekend lol
vcutrader	726061204913922048	2016-04-29T14:50:55	These Fox News IN polls have to be double digit for Trump for this to happen

vcutrader	726059772852768769	2016-04-29T14:45:14	Ok, now I see why Pence talk is happening...confirms my thinking 
vcutrader	726058403571896320	2016-04-29T14:39:47	The Pence endorsement is so risky for no gain. If Cruz takes IN, chances DT gets 1,237 still  65%+. Plus JK is pissed &amp; can get DT over
vcutrader	726057614979657728	2016-04-29T14:36:39	If Pence endorses Cruz, interesting because (i) he's a plausible 2020 contender AND (ii) he's up for re-elect this year in a tight race.
vcutrader	726056393850142720	2016-04-29T14:31:48	NateSilver538 Rubio and Kasich

vcutrader	726053769327288320	2016-04-29T14:21:22	flaunttnualf legs meaning it can happen and yes, make it tighter...
vcutrader	726053354892353536	2016-04-29T14:19:43	This Pence endorsement may have legs actually. Polls must have swung hard for Trump for an endorsement to come on a Friday (just 4 days)
vcutrader	726052662886711296	2016-04-29T14:16:58	JimPBurton Trump covers borders, gun, and economy - which is good enough for me.  Of course, wish more conservative but better than HC
vcutrader	726049873167024128	2016-04-29T14:05:53	JimPBurton but i still believe his best option was to back Trump, lock up VP, take the Midwest for him and let DT destroy the South and NE
vcutrader	726049667847442432	2016-04-29T14:05:04	JimPBurton the only shot i believe Cruz would have would be a Rubio or Haley VP (play on the South) and it's gone...(again IMO)
vcutrader	726047419809566721	2016-04-29T13:56:08	JimPBurton Cruz isn't a bad candidate, the problem with Cruz is the map.  Only swing state he wins in WI - pop vote tells us that
vcutrader	726047152800190464	2016-04-29T13:55:05	JimPBurton understand ppl have deep feeling for Cruz but never won a county OH, FL, VA, SC, GA, TN, MD, PA, DE, CT, RI, or NY
vcutrader	726046433586073601	2016-04-29T13:52:13	JimPBurton if we want to give it to HC, then give it to Cruz....Trump is our only shot man
vcutrader	726045772240818176	2016-04-29T13:49:36	In a IN loss scenario, Trump will have 1,243 dels BEFORE convention with upside in CA, WA, and OR &amp; possible 9 more PA unbounds....
vcutrader	726045422272282624	2016-04-29T13:48:12	My view: Pence would have to be insane to endorsement Cruz right now (damage his image since it's over) and still think Trump wins IN
vcutrader	726045119674208258	2016-04-29T13:47:00	Chatter of Pence endorsement for Cruz coming this afternoon and Larry Sabato calling for Cruz win, creating mini pop in Cruz IN shares

vcutrader	726032364992888832	2016-04-29T12:56:19	Jeb Bush and Marco were harder to beat than Hillary IMO, Trump momentum at third stage - capitulation....next is the last stage, panic
vcutrader	726032082586198017	2016-04-29T12:55:12	The fact that HC &amp; Trump are tied national w/ only poll that sampled LIKELY voters (not REGISTERED) is big considering he hasn't hit her yet

vcutrader	725306176519475201	2016-04-27T12:50:42	HC had only 20k more votes than DT in PA -- and he had two jokers to deal with, not one.  PA can go RED in Nov
vcutrader	725305344721866752	2016-04-27T12:47:24	If Cruz can't beat Trump to win a single county, he doesn't have a prayer against HC. If you argue so, then you admit DT is stronger than HC
vcutrader	725305170867937280	2016-04-27T12:46:42	How can tedcruz say he has a shot at winning vs. HC w/ ZERO won counties for PA, CT, VA, SC, GA, OH, FL, MD, RI, DE, AL, TN, and HI?
vcutrader	725303613384450048	2016-04-27T12:40:31	Appreciate the comments and messages on the delegate projections....ignoring the pundits and crunching the s pays dividends
vcutrader	725199722894471168	2016-04-27T05:47:42	I don't think you can chalk up Trump's excellent performances solely to demographics. Compare MD vs VA or PA vs IL. Something has changed.

vcutrader	721087361375985664	2016-04-15T21:26:38	My main premise for Trump/Kasich win: 1) Bernie voters bail on Hillary 2) key states only they can win (OH, MI, PA, CT, VT, NH, NV, FL)
vcutrader	721085598417756160	2016-04-15T21:19:38	If it's Trump and Kasich on the same ticket, they will win the General
vcutrader	721085300710182912	2016-04-15T21:18:27	Whether Cruz or Kasich get the nom or not (I say no) best GOP candidates in past 4 elections imo...take either one over Bush, McCain or Mitt

vcutrader	720920206974001152	2016-04-15T10:22:26	While Cruz &amp; Kasich are both mathematically eliminated, they could win in the convention. Biggest issue is they don't have majority pop vote
vcutrader	720919758263046144	2016-04-15T10:20:39	Trump's OP-ED in the WSJ is very thought provoking. People argue pop vote doesn't matter but it does great, esp in the general election (1/)

vcutrader	718939565793353728	2016-04-09T23:12:04	The next piece to the puzzle is on the Dem side. Hillary will lock up the nom after the NY win but what will happen to the Bernie votes?
vcutrader	718937479248801792	2016-04-09T23:03:46	ncLobo so rare to see a GOP candidate have the blue collar voter like Trump does - last time was Reagan and it seems like history all over
vcutrader	718937339196784642	2016-04-09T23:03:13	ncLobo right now if Trump gets nom, i say 58% HC 42% DT - if not Trump, it's 80/20 HC vs. whoever...he is a true wildcard
vcutrader	718936489036550148	2016-04-09T22:59:50	ncLobo thinking recently best ticket maybe Trump/Cruz VP
vcutrader	718936335646597122	2016-04-09T22:59:14	ncLobo creating around just 50% share and 11-12 state wins (forecasted) -- will be blowout, esp in South where he underperformed
vcutrader	718936160974815232	2016-04-09T22:58:32	ncLobo correct - big picture (way i see it) Cruz will have high 20's and low 30's w/ Rubio &amp; imo will lose 35-55% of Trump's (contd)
vcutrader	718934254269440001	2016-04-09T22:50:58	The dem/ind crossover has to be at least 25% that will not go to a Cruz or Ryan but maybe Kasich -- BIG DEAL

vcutrader	718933793990643712	2016-04-09T22:49:08	To be honest more than 50%+ of Trump's vote may not go to Cruz, Kasich or Ryan...

vcutrader	718889370762289153	2016-04-09T19:52:36	NateSilver538 but what about the rest of the PA dels?
vcutrader	718889195478061056	2016-04-09T19:51:55	hook910 the problem is the 20-30% of Trump supporters that are Dems or don't vote at all - no other GOP (maybe K for dem? gets that vote)
vcutrader	718886921154535424	2016-04-09T19:42:52	AnnCoulter AMEN! Been my point entire time. Has nothing to do with Cruz but GOP treatment to Trump.

vcutrader	718203706110570497	2016-04-07T22:28:01	Secondly, if you believe the General Election head to head, Kasich is only one GOP that is leading and it's +7.  Yet, won 1 state lol - ugh
vcutrader	718203413679468545	2016-04-07T22:26:52	General Election head to head come more relevant when it's head to head. Hard to imagine Bernie beating any of the 3, much less ALL 3
vcutrader	718203109743443968	2016-04-07T22:25:39	If you follow the General Election GOP vs. Dem matchups on RCP - Hillary average RCP # beats Trump/Cruz.  Sanders beats all 3!!

vcutrader	717800810760024065	2016-04-06T19:47:04	Bottom line imo: 75-80% chance of convention, Trump only shot is first ballot.
vcutrader	717800480253034497	2016-04-06T19:45:45	Scenario 3: GOP establishment make epic push on delegates, Ryan comes in to save the day. Kasich or Rubio VP.  Odds 15%.

vcutrader	717799971974721536	2016-04-06T19:43:44	Scenario 1: Trump wins first ballot - deal struck w/ most likely Kasich (maybe Cruz) - about 45% odds

vcutrader	715986197617754112	2016-04-01T19:36:26	To keep some momentum,Cruz will have to live in MD for weeks. After WI, Trump is going to overflow with momo, regardless of past wk (NY,etc)

vcutrader	715967506217889792	2016-04-01T18:22:10	Only case I see for Cruz GOP nom is 3rd/4th ballot, all unbound, he gets there but risky for him.  Ryan enters game then.
