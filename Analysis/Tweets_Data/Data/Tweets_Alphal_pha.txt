Alphal_pha	687007342769139713	2016-01-12T20:24:49	scttr_Brane yes, indeedy.  They are a thing of beauty too. That's why I'm constantly tinkering w/ the risk of both sides of the book.
Alphal_pha	687005780848054272	2016-01-12T20:18:36	For some reason, I have gotten to the point, where I feel like I'm just in the flow.   I just try my instincts.  Hopefully, I can stay here.
Alphal_pha	687005498231681025	2016-01-12T20:17:29	The people here were asking me "what are you doing?  you just covered that"..and I was like "I did?..well, fuck it,..I want to be short now"
Alphal_pha	687005167087042561	2016-01-12T20:16:10	Late last year, I covered a short on Tuesday because it "felt" like it wanted to rally.  By Thursday, it was my BIGGEST short position.
Alphal_pha	687004967517962240	2016-01-12T20:15:22	I know I lost my mind a long time ago...but I'm going back &amp; forth between handicapping the odds of a pending recession &amp; covering shorts.
Alphal_pha	686974808127574016	2016-01-12T18:15:32	RChang6 Maybe, but I don't recall him saying anything about E.coli.   Think it was more an valuation call..."it's just burritos", etc..
Alphal_pha	686973716933275649	2016-01-12T18:11:12	.RChang6 Yep, you might be right.  Like I said, dude is wicked smart...just always leery of people straying out of their core competencies.
Alphal_pha	686970644358119424	2016-01-12T17:58:59	I'm been forecasting and graphing so long...  that even my mama thinks that my mind is gone.
Alphal_pha	686969917715906561	2016-01-12T17:56:06	Ton of respect for Gundlach  But was wondering if he every covered his AAPL short "of a lifetime" from early 2012?
Alphal_pha	686951841788211201	2016-01-12T16:44:16	Some are speculating.  Some are hedging.   (Thinking, this is stupid..but if THEY win and I'm not part of it, I'm screwed)
Alphal_pha	686951519284019200	2016-01-12T16:42:59	Something very concerning about an entire office of hedge fund professionals (analyst/PMs/Operations) going "in" on PowerBall tickets.
Alphal_pha	686941942354198528	2016-01-12T16:04:56	You may say what does trading in Tech collapse or housing crisis have to do w/ oil?  The answer is "people"  It's all behavioral finance!
Alphal_pha	686941507132207104	2016-01-12T16:03:12	...itself until something major happens.  Emergency cut from OPEC or Major OSX or E&amp;P goes down or Petrobras cancels major contracts
Alphal_pha	686941114830565376	2016-01-12T16:01:39	Having actively traded through: tech boom/bust housing crises &amp; now oil collapse (part 2 for me)  My gut says this will just feed on...
Alphal_pha	686929207239290881	2016-01-12T15:14:20	EnergyRosen This reminds me an old guy that told me in 2007 that this "thing" was going to be over until somebody big like BAC went down.
Alphal_pha	686928493729452032	2016-01-12T15:11:30	Josh - I think your post is great, but...  You do realize you are describing about 50% of the people that go on TV? 
Alphal_pha	686919343590998017	2016-01-12T14:35:08	CatspawInv This one in particular just wants to make sure I know who wears the pants in this "relationship".    He's not going anywhere.

Alphal_pha	686669223238709248	2016-01-11T22:01:15	The sad thing is there is a very strong INVERSE correlation between the "utility" of an analyst (I employ) &amp; the time they spend on twitter.
Alphal_pha	686665603516612608	2016-01-11T21:46:52	If I can make this transition, then twitter will be useful.  Otherwise, it’s just too much noise.    Fin Twit needs to evolve,  Agreed? No?
Alphal_pha	686665177442467842	2016-01-11T21:45:10	I welcome real feedback   (I’m always open to honest and thoughtful discussion and/or disagreement).
Alphal_pha	686664991697702912	2016-01-11T21:44:26	I’m going to TRY and limit my snark (which will be admittedly hard for me).    I’ll talk about SOME of the stuff we are doing at our shop.
Alphal_pha	686664906150686720	2016-01-11T21:44:05	So, I’m going to TRY and do something a little different.    I’m going to TRY and just talk about real insights into what I’m looking at.
Alphal_pha	686664776689303552	2016-01-11T21:43:35	Obviously, I’m anonymous so I could care less about how many followers I have (I’m not trying to make $ off twitter or "building a brand").
Alphal_pha	686664563748663296	2016-01-11T21:42:44	Maybe the problem is Twitter itself (140 characters is just too limiting, even w/ tweetstorms).  Maybe, people w/ real insight are too busy.
Alphal_pha	686664378486243328	2016-01-11T21:42:00	Of course, these people ARE out there &amp; when they are tweeting about the markets they are gold.   There just doesn’t seem to be enough of it
Alphal_pha	686664160906723328	2016-01-11T21:41:08	Very few people tend to tweet things that make me really sit and think.  Makes me either change my opinion or reinforces my thinking.
Alphal_pha	686663955901714432	2016-01-11T21:40:19	3)They tweet just completely cynical shit.  (That management team is a bunch of idiots, Hedge Funds are lousy, CNBC is a joke, etc…)
Alphal_pha	686663809474412544	2016-01-11T21:39:44	2) They tweet about stats (the market goes down an average of 41% of the time on Tuesdays following a bad prior week) type of stuff.
Alphal_pha	686663698799288322	2016-01-11T21:39:18	1) They tweet about how to be a better investors, general rules of thumbs, quotes from other traders/investors,etc… (things like that)
Alphal_pha	686663536441950212	2016-01-11T21:38:39	More specifically, what are the things worth tweeting?  I find most professional investors fall into a certain style of tweeting As follows:
Alphal_pha	686663347710865410	2016-01-11T21:37:54	I have been thinking about the 2016, Twitter &amp; trying to think about the best way to use it.  On who to follow, I'm good.  I got that down.
Alphal_pha	686663031389028353	2016-01-11T21:36:38	OK, I have been doing some thinking.  (This is probably not a good thing) ….  so bear with me as I blast a few things out.
Alphal_pha	686650764052271104	2016-01-11T20:47:54	That's it...probably too much overconfidence.   Now, I have to be worried about the pending ass kicking I'm most likely about to take.
Alphal_pha	686650146000470016	2016-01-11T20:45:26	I told you I was usually early...  This time I was about 4 minutes early.  I suck!  
Alphal_pha	686620528791130114	2016-01-11T18:47:45	Feels like we are getting close..  I'm usually a little bit early...  For now, I'll just move my stops down on my short positions.
Alphal_pha	686610423039262720	2016-01-11T18:07:36	If you manage more than $50 dollars, go subscribe to this man's Real Vision  More signals...less noise! RaoulGMI 
Alphal_pha	686609006526361600	2016-01-11T18:01:58	What's the toughest trade from here in Energy?  I don't know I have the balls to stay short "single digit midgets"
Alphal_pha	686608085234937856	2016-01-11T17:58:18	It's a beautiful thing  Too bad I'm just a boring l/s equity guy  (not really, because I would have blown myself up) 
Alphal_pha	686605374858883073	2016-01-11T17:47:32	It may not be AOL/TimeWarner but FCX has made some awful acquisitions(Bad timing&amp; overpaying As a result, it's looking like they got to "go"
Alphal_pha	686569674805514241	2016-01-11T15:25:40	It will be interesting to see if the hospitals can hold gains for once.  For the past few months, people have sold ALL news (good &amp; bad).

Alphal_pha	685569567373037568	2016-01-08T21:11:36	7 times out of 10 it works every time.   
Alphal_pha	685569310392238080	2016-01-08T21:10:35	Sometime early next week, I'll ask my analyst for their best long ideas &amp; they'll recoil, make a face &amp; ask "What are you talking about?"
Alphal_pha	685567993166823424	2016-01-08T21:05:21	Relax, Relax...1 or 2 more days...   Puke 'em out.  Get Bullard out there talking..  We'll run 'em back the other way.  Wash, Rinse, Repeat

Alphal_pha	685536793660420099	2016-01-08T19:01:22	And MandyCNBC pulls the "you're breaking up..I can't hear you"  meanwhile the producer is yelling in her ear..."Wrap this guy up!!"
Alphal_pha	685536422372192256	2016-01-08T18:59:54	Oh Snap...that was fast!   herbgreenberg is probably behind this..
Alphal_pha	685511547473498112	2016-01-08T17:21:03	I love how some people talk shit about stocks at 4:30 (after some news comes out)..  ..&amp; then get real quiet the day when it bounces on them
Alphal_pha	685481066925285376	2016-01-08T15:19:56	Funny thing about clients...is they don't fuss at you that much for flattish Alpha when the market is dropping &amp; that low Beta kicks in.
Alphal_pha	685476083903414273	2016-01-08T15:00:08	If you see new followers ramp (and they are not porn looking robots), then that's a good sign.  Until then, just trade TWTR don't invest.
Alphal_pha	685475464023044097	2016-01-08T14:57:40	My thesis is that anybody that has more than 1,000 followers (and works on Wall St) ought to be able to figure out when to buy TWTR
Alphal_pha	685180512965648385	2016-01-07T19:25:38	My wife somehow thinks that the market is down because of...  ..hover boards!  After all, they are linked to China..
Alphal_pha	685179817717792773	2016-01-07T19:22:53	Alert..Alert...  I made a preemptive outbound call to one of my more panicky clients..  the are NOT panicky yet.
Alphal_pha	685161870215483392	2016-01-07T18:11:34	Don't cover until you see the whites of herbgreenberg and David Tice's eyes (in a box on CNBC).
Alphal_pha	685127561286955008	2016-01-07T15:55:14	Of course, there is also the theory that peak oil is true.  Maybe Saudi sees the decline curves coming  That's why they hit the panic button
Alphal_pha	685126098267586560	2016-01-07T15:49:25	How's this for conspiracy theory?  Aramco floats 5%..gives them more flexibility to win the war on shale  Eventually buys shale w/ new stock
Alphal_pha	685097073121820672	2016-01-07T13:54:05	EnergyRosen Was just discussing that as well. If quality E&amp;Ps are concerned about getting through the valley,who else is thinking the same?
Alphal_pha	685093085324390402	2016-01-07T13:38:14	ME:I like this one. One dog goes one way &amp; the other goes the other  &amp; my analyst is saying “Whaddya want from me?" 
Alphal_pha	685092829484445696	2016-01-07T13:37:13	Come to think of it...  Here is a picture of my energy analyst pitching me pair trade ideas. 
Alphal_pha	685092095669960704	2016-01-07T13:34:18	Pair Trades w/ long biases towards higher quality E&amp;P &amp; shorting lower quality E&amp;P &amp; OSX.    But both sides of the trade are still DOGS!
Alphal_pha	685091975477985280	2016-01-07T13:33:50	That’s why I have been mostly market neutral (dollar terms) in Energy over the last 18 months (negative beta). Almost all pair trades.
Alphal_pha	685087482770243584	2016-01-07T13:15:58	Saudi rig counts are UP!  You want to call the turn in a global commodity, go ahead...be my guess...  I'm fine w/ missing the first bounce.
Alphal_pha	685087266977505280	2016-01-07T13:15:07	But the move down from $60 is just a much a function of weakening global demand.  &amp; what is OPEC over last 9 months...Increasing Production!
Alphal_pha	685086891495002112	2016-01-07T13:13:37	Maybe I'm just a dumb "tourist"...but the move in oil from $100 to $60 was a function of excess supply (OPEC).
Alphal_pha	684838086094753792	2016-01-06T20:44:58	Factsionary I don't know about that...but then gain, I usually start with "Do you even know WTF you  are talking about?"  Results may vary
Alphal_pha	684826824388546561	2016-01-06T20:00:13	The biggest takeaway from my 3 hour meeting w/ the consultant.  They are more worried about missing a rally than protecting on the downside!
Alphal_pha	684757565461364736	2016-01-06T15:25:00	About to dip into a long (2-3 hour) due diligence meeting w/ a consultant.  I hate that I feel like like I'm going to miss something.
Alphal_pha	684750066343632902	2016-01-06T14:55:12	Like I said before...My P&amp;L got a lot better when I stopped predicting and started listening!  Pattern recognition!  
Alphal_pha	684491891740663809	2016-01-05T21:49:18	.UnderwaterCap I think a bottom in comps is close but I wonder if margins will be permanently impaired if changes in food prep R required?
Alphal_pha	684490806707765248	2016-01-05T21:45:00	.wtp345 Yeah, you might be right. Who knows.  All I know is, the business was more fun when nobody even knew what a hedge fund was!
Alphal_pha	684486761003773952	2016-01-05T21:28:55	.wtp345 Oversupplied? Perhaps.  But I would argue that private client advisors are oversupplied too (especially charging 150bps for ETFs)
Alphal_pha	684486469268979712	2016-01-05T21:27:46	.resdavies Don't know..but It looks like it's just median manager vs S&amp;P (or other benchmark)  Beside, Normura wouldn't lie would they?
Alphal_pha	684478382453686272	2016-01-05T20:55:38	wtp345 I guess that depends on how many interest rate cycles you think we have been through.  Old bond guys would say we have only had 3-4
Alphal_pha	684467844344594436	2016-01-05T20:13:45	Index all you want.  As an active manager, I like my odds over the next few years. 
Alphal_pha	684459886030270465	2016-01-05T19:42:08	The whole world is talking about how U needed to be long FANG to outperform last year But if U were short WMT,QCOM,PG, you probably did fine
Alphal_pha	684459220763328512	2016-01-05T19:39:29	The fastest way to add alpha is to short one of these top 20 names &amp; take a big active (&amp; relative) bet..  Of course, you got to be right :)
Alphal_pha	684457344571453441	2016-01-05T19:32:02	The top 70 stocks make up HALF of the S&amp;P (cap weighted).    It's not "Nifty Fifty" territory yet, but it's getting there.
Alphal_pha	684456650166681600	2016-01-05T19:29:16	No doubt.  But the people flocking into ETFs will come right back out as soon as they see active mgt outperform.  That's when it "unwinds."
Alphal_pha	684456297417306112	2016-01-05T19:27:52	IMO, the risk/reward for finding alpha right now is not to try &amp;find the next NFLX but to short large S&amp;P components that are breaking down.
Alphal_pha	684455683551555584	2016-01-05T19:25:26	The S&amp;P has gotten very top heavy.  At some point, it sort of "tips" and becomes a self fulfilling prophesy where active mgt gets a bad wrap
Alphal_pha	684455248887451648	2016-01-05T19:23:42	Just referring to the my thesis that equal weighted S&amp;P (or active management) will start to beat the S&amp;P  EfficientMarkts ReformedBroker
Alphal_pha	684453616711823360	2016-01-05T19:17:13	To me, this is the next great Alpha source...Just study the Nifty Fifty to see what happens when this unwinds.     
Alphal_pha	684395414334914560	2016-01-05T15:25:56	He runs it because, at the end of the day (career), he's addicted to playing the game at the highest level.    Results are fantastic.
Alphal_pha	684395198105939968	2016-01-05T15:25:05	A few yrs ago,I coaxed my old mentor out of retirement to run a long only fund.Nothing I could pay him would change his lifestyle EdBorgato
Alphal_pha	684115251474870272	2016-01-04T20:52:40	They always eventually track it down &amp; fix it but these people are constantly wiring money to the wrong bank or wrong amounts. It's amazing!
Alphal_pha	684114838549868546	2016-01-04T20:51:02	I think regular people would be surprised how often operations departments lose track of large amounts of money ($10M+)during wire transfers
Alphal_pha	684109998906032129	2016-01-04T20:31:48	I follow 100 people (only 60ish are active). Most are anonymous.But that part doesn't matter..you can tell who knows what their doing dasan
