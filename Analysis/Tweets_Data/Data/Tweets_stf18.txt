stf18	713916089931927553	2016-03-27T02:30:34	JackF2323 StephanieKelton mikenorman so issue is really what type of deficit not financing
stf18	713916006222069760	2016-03-27T02:30:14	JackF2323 StephanieKelton mikenorman point is heli drop is about financing, but in reality financing is always the same.

stf18	713914676367597568	2016-03-27T02:24:57	JackF2323 StephanieKelton mikenorman velocity is wrong term.  It's about multiplier. Yes I think it would be best hope tho (along w/ jg)
stf18	713913595294195712	2016-03-27T02:20:39	beckyquick83 peterfraserbris kocherlakota009 yes, it's not about financing or not. That's the key.
stf18	713913299788636160	2016-03-27T02:19:29	JackF2323 StephanieKelton mikenorman spending directly to people is better choice but no more of heli drop than defense spending, etc
stf18	713912695477501952	2016-03-27T02:17:05	JackF2323 StephanieKelton mikenorman fine. But you're still missing the point
stf18	713912393764442114	2016-03-27T02:15:53	JackF2323 StephanieKelton mikenorman right. But kocherlakota explains why the generally accepted view is wrong

stf18	713910657142263810	2016-03-27T02:08:59	JackF2323 StephanieKelton mikenorman so then it's about your preferred approach to deficits, like BI, etc
stf18	713910532814704640	2016-03-27T02:08:29	JackF2323 StephanieKelton mikenorman another way of saying it would be that all deficits are helicopter drops
stf18	713910303675691010	2016-03-27T02:07:34	JackF2323 StephanieKelton mikenorman if you want BI, that's fine. But it's just deficit spending,  not cash, b/c there's no such thing
stf18	713910049672794112	2016-03-27T02:06:34	JackF2323 StephanieKelton mikenorman no. Because there is no such thing as a helicopter drop
stf18	713908949292953604	2016-03-27T02:02:11	JackF2323 StephanieKelton mikenorman no such thing as a helicopter drop, as I keep trying to tell you
stf18	713908513165082625	2016-03-27T02:00:27	JackF2323 StephanieKelton mikenorman that was kocherlakotas point, and he's right
stf18	713908267781521408	2016-03-27T01:59:29	JackF2323 StephanieKelton mikenorman no such thing as fed direct cash to consumer
stf18	713908146532560896	2016-03-27T01:59:00	JackF2323 StephanieKelton mikenorman that's just a type of deficit, not a helicopter drop
stf18	713904454018273280	2016-03-27T01:44:20	JackF2323 StephanieKelton mikenorman that's also the point kocherlakota was correctly making
stf18	713904249629880320	2016-03-27T01:43:31	JackF2323 StephanieKelton mikenorman  IOW there's no such thing as a  helicopter drop.
stf18	713904004120489984	2016-03-27T01:42:32	JackF2323 StephanieKelton mikenorman you're not understanding what heli $ means. It's just basic deficit. Point=type of spending not heli
stf18	713898318795943936	2016-03-27T01:19:57	JackF2323 StephanieKelton mikenorman same things.  Helicopter drops are the same thing as any other deficit

stf18	710168693582520320	2016-03-16T18:19:45	NathanTankus edwardnh He doesn't like MMT, SFC models, or endog money. Just wants to do his IS-LM.  Why does any PKE'er care what he says?
stf18	710167866293747714	2016-03-16T18:16:28	ari1601 dr_nrl edwardnh Right.  To say otherwise is to ignore functional finance while critiquing MMT.  Total inconsistency.
stf18	710141003005566976	2016-03-16T16:29:43	wgoggin edwardnh I think in Palley's case, at least, he's not capable of understanding MMT.
stf18	710138855538692097	2016-03-16T16:21:11	ari1601 edwardnh Right.  And, of course, MMT has never claimed to be a complete macro theory.  We take much of PKE macro as given.
stf18	710138619781128192	2016-03-16T16:20:15	edwardnh And even then it's only AD side.  Prices are set by producers, wage pressures, etc., and his quote says nothing about those
stf18	710138440772427777	2016-03-16T16:19:32	edwardnh So, then issue from MMT perspective is not zero rate but combo of govt budget position/zero rate/non-govt sector desired spending
stf18	710138206415626240	2016-03-16T16:18:36	edwardnh Appears he recognizes problem from his paradigm as zero rate and not "money" vs. bonds, per se, yes?
stf18	710138048697266176	2016-03-16T16:17:59	edwardnh Right.  First, easy solution from his paradigm is raise IOR to desired target rate.
stf18	710136529490997248	2016-03-16T16:11:56	edwardnh what is he saying "creates inflation pressure"?  didn't see it in your pasted quote
stf18	710135427110404096	2016-03-16T16:07:34	edwardnh So, IOW, MMT never "ignored" this, but rather showed that it doesn't matter.  Can't disprove MMT by just assuming it's wrong
stf18	710134967834124288	2016-03-16T16:05:44	= garbage.  Bad and unscholarly to rely on critics' misrepresentations (Wray/Tymoigne pointed out several)  
stf18	710134497757536256	2016-03-16T16:03:52	edwardnh Basic operations tells you not possible to "print money" w/o IOR=target rate, which is not significantly diff from Tbill.
stf18	710134251900051457	2016-03-16T16:02:53	edwardnh Palley has never understood banking--he's exog money--let alone what MMT is saying on this.  SWL much the same by extension.
stf18	710133214946463745	2016-03-16T15:58:46	edwardnh Thanks, Ed.  Do you have a view regarding which inflation indicator(s) are getting it right?

stf18	694877096393338880	2016-02-03T13:36:24	NathanTankus So, technically, one could argue that large ER reduce ROA with the possibility of raising ROE via leverage.
stf18	694876881498165248	2016-02-03T13:35:33	NathanTankus I'm sure ER has become a structural reality for them. ROA--and then ROE--are always the core measures of profitability, though

stf18	693125927677497344	2016-01-29T17:37:53	shishiqiushi NathanTankus tymoignee meant to say procyclical cost of capital, but in denominator so effect is countercyclical
stf18	693125833792188416	2016-01-29T17:37:31	shishiqiushi NathanTankus tymoignee also, equity risk premium and default risk premiums reduce countercyclicality of cost of capital
stf18	693125269561847808	2016-01-29T17:35:16	shishiqiushi NathanTankus tymoignee IOW, procyclicality of FCF is more important for NPV than countercyclicality of cost of capital
stf18	693125012899831808	2016-01-29T17:34:15	shishiqiushi NathanTankus tymoignee And you still have the fact that FCF is way more important than discount rate for NPV

stf18	693122124173570048	2016-01-29T17:22:46	shishiqiushi NathanTankus tymoignee Not strange to me. capital inv based on NPV not discount; cost of eq matters more for discount than i
stf18	693118669124034560	2016-01-29T17:09:02	shishiqiushi NathanTankus tymoignee Is this just Keynes's liquidity preference vs. marginal efficiency of capital?
stf18	693117017172238337	2016-01-29T17:02:29	shishiqiushi NathanTankus tymoignee but how is that an arbitrage for the bank, which buys none of those?
stf18	693115617814011905	2016-01-29T16:56:55	shishiqiushi NathanTankus tymoignee I'm not understanding.  Banks don't buy cap goods or consumer goods.
stf18	693113031992020995	2016-01-29T16:46:38	shishiqiushi NathanTankus tymoignee problem with real rate there is for longer term rates, real rate isn't actual holding period return
stf18	693112822381699072	2016-01-29T16:45:48	shishiqiushi NathanTankus tymoignee and if both are real, then you can just use nominal--same adjustment to both, no?
stf18	693112677334265856	2016-01-29T16:45:14	shishiqiushi NathanTankus tymoignee Right, but what are the operational details of the arb?
stf18	693110821333774336	2016-01-29T16:37:51	shishiqiushi NathanTankus tymoignee how can you have no arb condition if you can't define which risk free rate?
stf18	693110077952118784	2016-01-29T16:34:54	shishiqiushi NathanTankus tymoignee can you explain the arb?
stf18	693108136798883841	2016-01-29T16:27:11	shishiqiushi NathanTankus tymoignee Another problem is that "natural rate" framework ignores public and private debt. Can't do that.
stf18	693108048202584065	2016-01-29T16:26:50	shishiqiushi NathanTankus tymoignee A problem with nat rate is "which rate?" overnight? 3m? 10y?  risk-free? mortgage?
stf18	693107377592094722	2016-01-29T16:24:10	shishiqiushi NathanTankus tymoignee Eric said it reduces profitability (ROA).  Doesn't necessarily reduce profits.
stf18	693106469307158528	2016-01-29T16:20:34	tymoignee NathanTankus Yes, and that means you get out of balance sheet recession via more debt.  Not smart.
stf18	693106204768206848	2016-01-29T16:19:31	tymoignee NathanTankus Exactly.  negative IOR necessarily cuts ROA, unless banks can cut deposit rates still more to offset turnover fall
stf18	693105718430314496	2016-01-29T16:17:35	shishiqiushi NathanTankus tymoignee depends on which PK approach you're talking about.  "Park it" or "AD mgmt," and LT vs. ST risk-free?

stf18	682629043208982528	2015-12-31T18:27:01	MattBruenig jeffspross (3) your comments suggest folly of current macro theories assuming Fed should dominate; maybe it shouldn't.

stf18	682622205675442177	2015-12-31T17:59:50	MattBruenig jeffspross Precisely the point.  BEFORE the spending, forecast if the permanent program raises inflation at full employment.
