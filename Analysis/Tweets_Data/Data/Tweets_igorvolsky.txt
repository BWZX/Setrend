igorvolsky	725436251482918912	2016-04-27T21:27:34	To me, the Ted Cruz/Carly Fiorina news has an "if a tree falls in a forest..." quality to it.
igorvolsky	725383286747443200	2016-04-27T17:57:07	A table of the contradictions contained within Donald Trump's foreign policy speech today  
igorvolsky	725372158839500800	2016-04-27T17:12:54	It would be really fun to make a great big table laying out all of the contradictions within this Trump foreign policy speech
igorvolsky	725370751067500546	2016-04-27T17:07:18	Every speech has *something* you can agree with, right? 
igorvolsky	725368440538693633	2016-04-27T16:58:07	Trump pledges to defeat ISIS with unpredictability.   Reminds me of Nixon's secret plan to end the Vietnam War (which worked out SO WELL)
igorvolsky	725367888866103297	2016-04-27T16:55:56	And this is a scripted speech which his rag tag team of foreign policy advisers presumably spent some time on

igorvolsky	725310149926248450	2016-04-27T13:06:30	The sexism radiating from this attack is really astounding. Not surprising, just astounding.

igorvolsky	707395548278468608	2016-03-09T02:40:16	So every network is currently carrying Trump presser and ignoring Hillary's rally? Is that right?
igorvolsky	707393773408391168	2016-03-09T02:33:12	Trump really hates periods. He loves commas.

igorvolsky	706881762035634181	2016-03-07T16:38:39	sears_zc I never said they can't be sued for that. But PLCAA makes suing them very very hard for negligence.
igorvolsky	706879028268044288	2016-03-07T16:27:48	They've already forced gun makes to adopt additional safety features and cut ties with shitty dealers, so i disagree 
igorvolsky	706878743038525442	2016-03-07T16:26:40	The number of people telling me that gun makers &amp; dealers should not be held responsible for product safety &amp; distribution is shocking
igorvolsky	706878476058533888	2016-03-07T16:25:36	If GM sought to save $ w/ cheap parts &amp; those parts led to more driver deaths. Yes, driver responsible. BUT SO IS GM FOR FAILING ON SAFETY
igorvolsky	706877638955175936	2016-03-07T16:22:16	Folks, this isn't "OMG, killer pulled trigger don't shift blame." OBVIOUSLY killer responsible. But q is: did maker/dealer ignore red flags
igorvolsky	706877205364776960	2016-03-07T16:20:33	mccarthytony There is a suit alleging that they are:

igorvolsky	706679277824008193	2016-03-07T03:14:03	In another stark contrast:   Dems held debate in Flint &amp; talked FlintWaterCrisis  GOP have largely ignored it.

igorvolsky	706667420224765957	2016-03-07T02:26:56	The idea that “everyone is a little racist,” is a very twisted concept created to make white people feel that racism is not about power.
igorvolsky	706663767430443008	2016-03-07T02:12:25	½ of all the people who die from guns every day in America are African American men.
igorvolsky	706663103648280576	2016-03-07T02:09:47	Shocked Sanders argued gun makers not responsible for gun deaths. Some make super dangerous products &amp; knowingly sell to shady dealers
igorvolsky	706661787752501248	2016-03-07T02:04:33	That’s a common principle in liability law. When you’re manufacturing you prepare for the worse, for reality.
igorvolsky	706661577429135361	2016-03-07T02:03:43	But then the idea is that GM knows that a lot of people are going to crash cars and you have to make cars that can withstand it
igorvolsky	706661473318100992	2016-03-07T02:03:19	You can bring a lawsuit against General Motors for not making cars that can withstand crashes. Yes the person who crashed the car is a cause
igorvolsky	706661338584461312	2016-03-07T02:02:46	Sanders is dead wrong. It's not that gun maker is responsible for death. It's that gun maker is knowingly selling unsafe guns to bad dealers

igorvolsky	706512445074907136	2016-03-06T16:11:07	Shouldn't the argument against Trump be that his hate-filled politics would fundamentally transform American values &amp; cultural identity?

igorvolsky	705605469927251969	2016-03-04T04:07:08	Biggest takeaway from tonight: GOP is so desperate to derail Trump, Fox News is now fact checking him on live tv (ht laurenharmon)

igorvolsky	705582218140368896	2016-03-04T02:34:44	Yes, you would need "flexibility", since cost of Trump deportation plans:   $10,070 per person x 11.3 million undocumented = $114 BILLION

igorvolsky	697990977689096192	2016-02-12T03:49:51	Every candidate who wants to be president should learn from the successes and MISTAKES of presidents from their own party
igorvolsky	697990356365869056	2016-02-12T03:47:23	NO DEMOCRAT CAN EVER DISAGREE WITH A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT EVER. WTF is that?
igorvolsky	697990181559914496	2016-02-12T03:46:41	I mean come'n, we can't criticize President Obama? Really?
igorvolsky	697988938921803777	2016-02-12T03:41:45	CNN right now: Hillary and Bernie  Fox News right now: Pat Buchanan  Can the contrast be any starker?
igorvolsky	697988365568864257	2016-02-12T03:39:29	I think there is a BIG VOID in articulating a progressive foreign policy &amp; I'm just disappointed that Bernie has not been willing to fill it
igorvolsky	697987659805884416	2016-02-12T03:36:40	"maybe put pressure on [Iran] so they end their support for terrorism around the world" -- Bernie   HOW?!
igorvolsky	697985758175612928	2016-02-12T03:29:07	Are we really debating Henry Kissinger's foreign policy theories?
igorvolsky	697984913639870464	2016-02-12T03:25:46	Bernie had months to develop a detailed progressive foreign policy. He hasn't. This leads me to believe that he's not very interested in it
igorvolsky	697984251162206208	2016-02-12T03:23:08	"I will do everything I can" -- ok Bernie, WHAT WILL YOU DO?? WHAT IS EVERYTHING??
igorvolsky	697983919526907904	2016-02-12T03:21:48	I've said this before &amp; I'll say it again-- pointing out that Hillary voted for Iraq and you didn't IS NOT A FOREIGN POLICY PLAN OR A VISION
igorvolsky	697983701012082688	2016-02-12T03:20:56	Important to note that we've seen an increase in attacks against Muslims...

igorvolsky	697974996073844736	2016-02-12T02:46:21	This is the crazy statistic Hillary is highlighting: death rates increasing among some White Americans 
igorvolsky	697973890283343874	2016-02-12T02:41:57	The racial wealth gap 
igorvolsky	697972572017815552	2016-02-12T02:36:43	The racial disparity in police killings is absolutely insane: 
igorvolsky	697972185588244484	2016-02-12T02:35:11	Number of people killed by US police in 2015 at 1,000+  via guardiannews

igorvolsky	697968815343271936	2016-02-12T02:21:47	So I'm not sure about the framing here of OMG Dems will blow up government  
igorvolsky	697968505103241216	2016-02-12T02:20:33	Just so we're clear: under Obama,  we've actually lost 500K jobs public sector jobs.
igorvolsky	697968165196800000	2016-02-12T02:19:12	Great to hear Dems talking about how to make health care coverage MORE universal  While GOP is debating how fast they'd take away insurance
igorvolsky	697967923521069056	2016-02-12T02:18:15	If govt is the "single" payer, how does that work under a GOP administration that's not sympathetic to govt playing a role in health care?
igorvolsky	697967412394778624	2016-02-12T02:16:13	Some context: Here's what's happened to the uninsured rate since Obamacare became law:  DemDebate

igorvolsky	697544358598463488	2016-02-10T22:15:09	I tweeted this out on the 1st day of Christie's presidential campaign. And now, I'll tweet it out on the last.

igorvolsky	684529108567625728	2016-01-06T00:17:12	Rep. Walter Jones took in $52,150 from NRA, so he's only attributing gun violence to "Godless culture", not guns

igorvolsky	684463173408276482	2016-01-05T19:55:11	Enforce laws is exactly what these orders are trying to do. Have you read them, RepGoodlatte? ($61,150 from NRA)

igorvolsky	684447285133078528	2016-01-05T18:52:03	In reality, gun registry is already prohibited in current law and Obama actually INCREASES funding for mental health

igorvolsky	684445481280339969	2016-01-05T18:44:53	Unfortunately, RepDaveJoyce doesn't know that founding father George Washington was 1st to issue executive action 
igorvolsky	684445051137687553	2016-01-05T18:43:11	Guy who got $4,000 from NRA will have hard time explaining how improving gun safety tramples 2A

igorvolsky	684442504159170560	2016-01-05T18:33:03	This guy took in $36,300 from NRA &amp; probably got their generic statement opposing any gun regs as part of the deal 
igorvolsky	684440427987091456	2016-01-05T18:24:48	Sad 2 paragraph statement make no attempt to explain how any of POTUS' rules are in violation of Second Amendment

igorvolsky	684437297174069248	2016-01-05T18:12:22	You showed no respect for the 20 children killed in Newtown when you took $23,000 from NRA &amp; oppose gun rules

igorvolsky	684418883105763328	2016-01-05T16:59:12	Ted Poe fails to mention that NRA-funded lawmakers tie govt's hands in enforcing laws  
igorvolsky	684417247239090176	2016-01-05T16:52:42	Existing background check system has already prevented 2 million+ guns from getting into the wrong hands 
igorvolsky	684416962294841344	2016-01-05T16:51:34	There were lots of gun restrictions during Constitutional era. Dont expect guy who got $2000 from NRA to admit that

igorvolsky	684408090402385921	2016-01-05T16:16:19	So misleading. Federal gun prosecutions don't show full picture since many cases processed on state/local levels 1/2

igorvolsky	684392343722655744	2016-01-05T15:13:44	Since these actions neither circumvent 2ndAmendment nor restrict gun rights, it's exciting to have your support! 
igorvolsky	684392082748903424	2016-01-05T15:12:42	How will background checks and hiring more people to process background checks limit 2nd Amendment rights?

igorvolsky	684364205085093889	2016-01-05T13:21:56	MarshaBlackburn please. Like Congress would've actually done anything. You're more interested in donations from the NRA than saving lives.
igorvolsky	684362809463975936	2016-01-05T13:16:23	MarshaBlackburn And exactly what restrictions do you think he's proposing? Do you even know the content of his order?

igorvolsky	684361850084016128	2016-01-05T13:12:34	The same lawmakers who argue Obama should let Congress vote on gun measures would block Congress from even taking up or down vote on issue

igorvolsky	684359371950788608	2016-01-05T13:02:43	How is requiring people engaged in gun business to conduct background checks "restricting gun rights"? Pls explain 
igorvolsky	684358957247389697	2016-01-05T13:01:04	Despite them being noncontroversial since overwhelming majority support expanding background cheecks

igorvolsky	684342120581349376	2016-01-05T11:54:10	The guns are dangerous. Obama's efforts to regulate them are not.  
igorvolsky	684339943372632064	2016-01-05T11:45:31	Lawmakers take hundreds of thousands of dollars from this group. It spends millions in expenditures on their behalf 
igorvolsky	684338250887073792	2016-01-05T11:38:48	More guns were sold in December than almost any other month in nearly two decades

igorvolsky	684200162638585857	2016-01-05T02:30:05	So you'll direct government gun purchasers NOT to promote or use smart gun technology?! 
igorvolsky	684199819133480960	2016-01-05T02:28:43	You'll redirect $500 million meant to help individuals with serious mental illness?!  
igorvolsky	684199332489347072	2016-01-05T02:26:47	So you'll allow people to once again avoid background checks by buying MACHINE GUNS through a corporation?! 
igorvolsky	684197343391006721	2016-01-05T02:18:53	i.e. you, SenJohnMcCain, took in $46,350 from pro-gun groups since 1990 so see background check expansion as "fiat" 
igorvolsky	684194497467662336	2016-01-05T02:07:34	85% of Americans favor expanded background checks but NRA spent $30,650,008 in 2014 to make sure "reps of ppl" dont 
igorvolsky	684191957871161344	2016-01-05T01:57:29	Every president since George Washington has used executiveaction. Reagan issued 381 orders!

igorvolsky	684188677988323328	2016-01-05T01:44:27	Hard to see how expanding background checks - which even 92% of gun owners support - is "detrimental" or "divisive"  
igorvolsky	684182533181980674	2016-01-05T01:20:02	wastesyourtime Hey Derek, you guys are going to post today's show under Audio Archive soon, right?
igorvolsky	684182249198215170	2016-01-05T01:18:54	This statement criticizing Obama's gun orders as "detrimental to real solutions" doesn't explain HOW thats the case

igorvolsky	684179962895675392	2016-01-05T01:09:49	"I do believe that an AK-47, a machine gun, is NOT a sporting weapon or needed for defense of a home" -- Ronald Reagan, 2/6/1989

igorvolsky	684174100735127552	2016-01-05T00:46:31	FACT: All presidents beginning with George Washington in 1789 have issued executive orders.    
igorvolsky	684172208810360834	2016-01-05T00:39:00	Asks the senator who's forced budget restrictions Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms &amp; Explosives. The chutzpah!  
igorvolsky	684167953311334400	2016-01-05T00:22:05	.CarlyFiorina took $10,500+ from pro-gun groups so decided Obama is "lawless" before he even released orders 
igorvolsky	684166074028273667	2016-01-05T00:14:37	And that's of course why the NRA fearmongers about any sensible reforms. More $ for gun manufacturers.  
igorvolsky	684163719421673473	2016-01-05T00:05:16	But "gun grabbing tyranny" will help sell more guns, so will probably end up going with that.  
igorvolsky	684163434217357313	2016-01-05T00:04:08	That's exactly what he's trying to do, good sir.  
igorvolsky	684162252178599936	2016-01-04T23:59:26	No you idiot, they created the 2nd amendment b/c they wanted to empower state militias against standing armies 
igorvolsky	684161691794423808	2016-01-04T23:57:13	All POTUS issue executive orders including GeorgeHWBush who imposed his will&amp;banned import of semiautomatics in '89 
igorvolsky	684158799356268544	2016-01-04T23:45:43	So will you support Obama's request for funds to hire 200 ATF agents &amp; investigators to help enforce our gun laws?!  
igorvolsky	684158307909668864	2016-01-04T23:43:46	Prohibiting people who buy machine guns &amp; sawed-off shotguns from avoiding background checks is dangerous HOW?!  
igorvolsky	684157791360126976	2016-01-04T23:41:43	How does requiring people engaged in business of selling guns to conduct background checks a restriction of rights!? 
igorvolsky	684157431488851968	2016-01-04T23:40:17	Sen JohnCornyn received $15,909 in expenditures from the NRA to condemn about orders before they're even released 
igorvolsky	684156924112285696	2016-01-04T23:38:16	Blunt tweeted this before Obama released list of actions. He got $755,816 from NRA so details don't actually matter 
igorvolsky	684156324091981824	2016-01-04T23:35:53	Obama's executive action actually includes $500 million to increase access to mental health care 
igorvolsky	684155881018265602	2016-01-04T23:34:07	Here are the highlights of Obama's just-announced executive actions to curb gun violence:

igorvolsky	684124153528582145	2016-01-04T21:28:03	How can you promise to fight against something before seeing any of the details?!?  
igorvolsky	684084708720906240	2016-01-04T18:51:18	Oh wow -- NRA actually tweeted image with bullets next to pictures of lawmakers who introduced ammo limit bill 
igorvolsky	684049729194463232	2016-01-04T16:32:19	.NRA's attacks against Obama's gun order -&gt; fear&amp;paranoia   fear&amp;paranoia -&gt; ^gun sales  ^gun sales -&gt; $ for gun manufacturers/win for NRA

igorvolsky	684034170725789697	2016-01-04T15:30:29	Shameful to see a medical doc give zero shits about the consequences of gun violence bc he got $6,960 from NRA 
igorvolsky	684033471828852736	2016-01-04T15:27:43	.SteveScalise took $13,950 from NRA so he obviously thinks expanding background checks somehow limits "2a rights"

igorvolsky	684014617614528513	2016-01-04T14:12:47	GOP's claim that Obama's gun executive orders will take away guns, feeds &amp; nurtures the anti-government militiamen movement happening in OR

igorvolsky	683655840264548352	2016-01-03T14:27:08	Jeb only Bush still pandering to NRA  George H.W. resigned from NRA in 1995  George W. endorsed assault weapons ban 
igorvolsky	683655045787856896	2016-01-03T14:23:59	In 1989,  President George H. W. Bush issued EXECUTIVE ORDER halting the importation of some semi-automatic firearms
