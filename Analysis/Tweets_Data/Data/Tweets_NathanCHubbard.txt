NathanCHubbard	723320842860400640	2016-04-22T01:21:42	Indeed. 
NathanCHubbard	723301910002855936	2016-04-22T00:06:28	I was an accessory, lost in the woodwork. But I saw Bono, the last great rockstar, leave no doubt that night: Prince was king.
NathanCHubbard	723301789760548865	2016-04-22T00:05:59	Prince reached across me, extending a fist toward Bono, who bowed his head with that wry smile of his and bumped Prince's fist with his own.
NathanCHubbard	723301694092648448	2016-04-22T00:05:36	During a guitar solo he strutted slowly over toward Bono, expressionless. Prince was at work.  He held a note dramatically and let it ring.
NathanCHubbard	723301582968774657	2016-04-22T00:05:10	An hour or so in, Prince looked up and saw Bono standing there. It drew his attention away from his music, but only for a split second.
NathanCHubbard	723301433819303938	2016-04-22T00:04:34	Bono eventually ambled down the stairs and stood to my left, blocking the entry to the catacomb. He'd stay there for four straight hours.
NathanCHubbard	723301358367985667	2016-04-22T00:04:16	Prince started and I went to the bottom of the stairs of the catacomb, standing probably 15 feet from the neck of his guitar.
NathanCHubbard	723301265397043201	2016-04-22T00:03:54	Bono showed up from taping American Idol, a bit tipsy in the old Irish way. He bummed a smoke from security and tried to light the filter.
NathanCHubbard	723301185243897856	2016-04-22T00:03:35	I went straight for it with a few of the promoters working the show. Bono was supposedly coming that night, and this would be his perch.
NathanCHubbard	723301097461313536	2016-04-22T00:03:14	Only 150 people got into Foundation Room. It was full of catacombs off the main area, including 1 by the back wall where his band set up.
NathanCHubbard	723301008483328006	2016-04-22T00:02:53	He played one long set for the main hall (~1500). Then one upstairs for the restaurant (~400). Then another level up to the Foundation Room.
NathanCHubbard	723300934764236800	2016-04-22T00:02:35	But for 2 shows, he decided to play at House of Blues on Sunset instead. For these he literally played all night. I was at the 1st one.
NathanCHubbard	723300853088587776	2016-04-22T00:02:16	Sometimes he'd play, sometimes he'd watch from the side. No one ever knew which it'd be. There were nights where he closed it down at 6am.
NathanCHubbard	723300765687644161	2016-04-22T00:01:55	His band would then retreat to a makeshift club for ~100 VIPs at the Forum and start playing. He'd glide in through the crowd ~1 hr later.
NathanCHubbard	723300686402715648	2016-04-22T00:01:36	Then he'd bring down the lights and come back out and play another ferocious set, replete with hits. The whole show sometimes had 40 songs.
NathanCHubbard	723300616546619393	2016-04-22T00:01:19	He would come out on a bicycle and ride around the floor section for like 15 minutes. Half the remaining crowd couldn't recognize him.
NathanCHubbard	723300496908242944	2016-04-22T00:00:51	He would play a 3 hour set and then bring up the house lights. The casual fans would leave. But the upper decks knew better. They waited.
NathanCHubbard	723300419800190976	2016-04-22T00:00:33	He'd play a solo piano/synth set and invariably stop in the middle and scream "I GOT TOO MANY HITS!!!!"
NathanCHubbard	723300333041000449	2016-04-22T00:00:12	He reinforced his role as the world's greatest guitar player. His voice at age 50 was stronger than it was at 25, perhaps his greatest feat.
NathanCHubbard	723300152962732032	2016-04-21T23:59:29	It worked, but those Forum shows are legendary for a bunch of other reasons.
NathanCHubbard	723300031571197953	2016-04-21T23:59:00	He was intent on keeping his tickets at $25. So he booked 21 shows and outplayed the demand. He wanted these shows to be for the people.
NathanCHubbard	723299854659674112	2016-04-21T23:58:18	He was supposed to play all 21 at The Forum. It was still owned by a church in Inglewood, and Prince thought it was the perfect setting.
NathanCHubbard	723299712070115328	2016-04-21T23:57:44	In 2011, Prince came to LA to play a 21 show residency. I went to 18 of them.
NathanCHubbard	723299564648685568	2016-04-21T23:57:09	1/?) A multi-tweet story about the night I watched Bono concede the throne to Prince literally right under my nose:

NathanCHubbard	709436664121303040	2016-03-14T17:50:56	The lineup for BillSimmons' new website ringer is here 
NathanCHubbard	708819076890558464	2016-03-13T00:56:51	7) Teams/artists must be CLEAR about the conditions applied to a ticket, and the market will dictate the success of that product in the end.
NathanCHubbard	708818513675231232	2016-03-13T00:54:37	6) All that said: in the same spirit of free markets, if teams behave badly, they should feel the pain in the form of fewer fans buying tix
NathanCHubbard	708817660734099456	2016-03-13T00:51:14	5) But if a ticket is transferable, seems like a fan should be able to sell it at market value.
NathanCHubbard	708817008486260736	2016-03-13T00:48:38	4) Teams can deal w/brokers who do this - forbid it in the contract when teams sell to them. Pull the tickets away next season.
NathanCHubbard	708815583039492096	2016-03-13T00:42:58	3)Sometimes secondary sites give incentives to brokers that reward them for sales volume and incentivize selling distressed tix for pennies.
NathanCHubbard	708815005743915009	2016-03-13T00:40:41	2) But teams+artists should be able to sell non-transferrable tix in the interest of giving fans a deal in a supply constrained market.
NathanCHubbard	708814435419197440	2016-03-13T00:38:25	1) Price floors are dumb in long run. They were intended to ease teams into selling primary and secondary together.

NathanCHubbard	698547558407274497	2016-02-13T16:41:30	What I'm saying is that just like we need to hold the hitters at the top accountable for leading on diversity, you must also be accountable.
NathanCHubbard	698547250645979136	2016-02-13T16:40:17	But this list puts a white old face on a business that is in the midst of dramatic reshaping by a group that crosses color, gender, and age.
NathanCHubbard	698547061684248577	2016-02-13T16:39:32	The hitters are at the top. I'd argue with your positioning, but not who's in charge. It's old white dudes. That's something to work on.
NathanCHubbard	698546828556382210	2016-02-13T16:38:36	The publishing business is hard and you've got to survive, and I understand that those who buy ads get some preference.
NathanCHubbard	698546506345787392	2016-02-13T16:37:20	So is the industry not diverse enough, or does this list just miss the point? The answer, of course, is both.
NathanCHubbard	698545988722491392	2016-02-13T16:35:16	In the clustering of Apple Music execs, you left out drdre. Did he give back his billion dollars they paid him to join their company?
NathanCHubbard	698545802084376577	2016-02-13T16:34:32	Kathy Willard is CFO of the company that writes the checks that make up ~70% of artists' income. You picked a label CFO in the top 15. Huh?
NathanCHubbard	698545543832678401	2016-02-13T16:33:30	Did FutureThePrince refuse to buy an ad? He manages Drake and is a product advisor to Twitter, the platform artists use to talk to fans.
NathanCHubbard	698545371975319552	2016-02-13T16:32:49	Seriously, was Troy Carter unavailable for the photo shoot? He's music's biggest ambassador to tech right now.
NathanCHubbard	698545104047353856	2016-02-13T16:31:45	But there are exactly 2 black people and 5 women they deemed worthy of a standalone spot. That's your music business, artists and fans.
NathanCHubbard	698544671732019201	2016-02-13T16:30:02	From a biz perspective, it massively devalues the importance of live music, omitting key execs and clustering others who should be solo.

NathanCHubbard	696388652692144129	2016-02-07T17:42:47	6) You're going to see an angle/perspective through live video in tweets you've never had access to before. You'll see the Super Bowl anew.
NathanCHubbard	696387884270510080	2016-02-07T17:39:44	5) Some companies are going to seize the moment too - you'll smile, and their brands will be forever changed thanks to a tweet tonight.
NathanCHubbard	696387821972508672	2016-02-07T17:39:29	4) Experts, influencers, and people you know will speak up. Will Taylor comment on Beyonce? Gwyneth on Coldplay? Eli on Peyton? Trump on...?
NathanCHubbard	696387754272247808	2016-02-07T17:39:13	3) Someone out there w/ only few followers will send a great tweet about the moment and have their idea heard by millions. (Enjoy the ride!)
NathanCHubbard	696387663356559362	2016-02-07T17:38:51	2) There's gonna be a moment - in the game, during halftime, the national anthem, whatever - and this place will light up with humanity.
NathanCHubbard	696387532959801345	2016-02-07T17:38:20	1) What's better than "Twitter Twitter"? SUPERBOWL TWITTER! Hang with us and remind yourself what makes Twitter so great. I can't wait for:
NathanCHubbard	696371463113220098	2016-02-07T16:34:29	If 2/3rds of seats are resold, that means there is $150M in lost profit going out into the ether. And taxpayers are asked to fund stadiums!
NathanCHubbard	696370247712903168	2016-02-07T16:29:39	For perspective on the lunacy of how these tix are distributed, consider that average face value is ~$1500.  
NathanCHubbard	696367964811956225	2016-02-07T16:20:35	MikeIsaac ...by then most good inventory is spoken for, brokers just liquidating the stuff that's left over in upper deck etc.
NathanCHubbard	696367760041857025	2016-02-07T16:19:46	MikeIsaac it is sold out always, but in some ways it's never sold out - a broker can find a ticket. You can get a deal last second but...
NathanCHubbard	696366785096908800	2016-02-07T16:15:54	Yeah, not so much. Ticket prices have held strong, volume has been pretty good, and nobody has been stuck holding the bag. Valley money ftw!
NathanCHubbard	695981395462606848	2016-02-06T14:44:30	Only on Twitter... 
NathanCHubbard	695734834971344900	2016-02-05T22:24:45	Okay maybe tomorrow.
NathanCHubbard	695734183767871488	2016-02-05T22:22:10	PRyanTexas well there you go. You think it holds overnight?
NathanCHubbard	695483476061990912	2016-02-05T05:45:56	ToddLindenbaum they get in for free
NathanCHubbard	695477824086355968	2016-02-05T05:23:29	ToddLindenbaum because they are getting them from the suits.
NathanCHubbard	695476876521832450	2016-02-05T05:19:43	wayfarersprayer nothing would be the case of the steelers were playing. All bets off.
NathanCHubbard	695476194209169409	2016-02-05T05:17:00	.peterstringer this was because the shorts couldn't cover. Fans literally couldn't buy.
NathanCHubbard	695475937173860352	2016-02-05T05:15:59	hunterwalk suckers have bought. Now it's supply and demand. The tech community is not paying, they are guests. So no money buying tickets.
NathanCHubbard	695474719349276672	2016-02-05T05:11:09	Not that anyone keeps track of these things, but I think tomorrow will be the largest single day price drop in super bowl ticket history.
NathanCHubbard	695472746881351682	2016-02-05T05:03:18	Untold NFL story so far: ticket prices have absolutely collapsed on Friday the past few Superbowls. Tech money not buying this year. So...?

NathanCHubbard	695084400329957380	2016-02-04T03:20:09	Tried to get some work done at Twitter HQ today but was figuratively drowned out by katienolan's epic day drinking. Ps it's only Wednesday.
NathanCHubbard	695074064101081088	2016-02-04T02:39:05	So are we! 
NathanCHubbard	694332949928411136	2016-02-02T01:34:10	Check out our own RABlank give katienolan a tour of Twitter HQ. We're probably out of beer now.  
NathanCHubbard	694219038214352896	2016-02-01T18:01:31	Some coverage unfairly crediting Sillerman for what Live Nation is today. He rolled up promoters, but that's it - rapino99 made it work.
NathanCHubbard	694217081307267072	2016-02-01T17:53:44	Feeling sorry for SFX employees. A reminder that roll ups must end as more than just a collection of assets. 
NathanCHubbard	694042947130515456	2016-02-01T06:21:47	LizJones they hadn't heard. Fortunately it is on demand on Fox now.
NathanCHubbard	694040294807855104	2016-02-01T06:11:15	Cannot wait to see tune in data on GreaseLive. Absolutely blew up Twitter on both coasts tonight. I didn't even know it was on. I do now!
NathanCHubbard	693996899834023936	2016-02-01T03:18:49	Historically speaking, what song has the cooler unintentional feedback on a live recording: Purple Rain or No Woman No Cry?
NathanCHubbard	693875857253793792	2016-01-31T19:17:50	MikeIsaac it is TERRIFIC

NathanCHubbard	693282597258964992	2016-01-30T04:00:26	1) tix are mis-priced because of unsophisticated sellers, 2) fan adoption of tech isn't the issue - it's that the right product isn't built
NathanCHubbard	693282014317776896	2016-01-30T03:58:07	Thought this was well done. Read it if you are a live event fan. Would argue a bit with the intro/closing premises. 
NathanCHubbard	693123654398291968	2016-01-29T17:28:51	Yup.   
NathanCHubbard	692880271977291776	2016-01-29T01:21:44	We joined Twitter because we believe even 140 character stories can change the world. oneteam

NathanCHubbard	692608916304211968	2016-01-28T07:23:28	I wrote about some of these issues here:  Might do a "why you can't get a ticket" next, unless the NY AG already has!
NathanCHubbard	692607474738733057	2016-01-28T07:17:44	This is a crusade we started years ago. So glad to see truth surfaced; now turn it into action. Fans deserve better:

NathanCHubbard	690327593568985089	2016-01-22T00:18:18	peterpham HamiltonMusical superbowl50 wait on the Super Bowl. Prices will almost certainly come down as we get closer to the event.
NathanCHubbard	689465040986976256	2016-01-19T15:10:50	The proof of concept is extremely compelling. He knows a thing or two about scaling companies. Go dickc! 
NathanCHubbard	688979860295778304	2016-01-18T07:02:53	2) When "Pretty" Ricky Conlan takes his shirt off in Creed, he should have immediately been renamed "Doughy" Ricky Conlan. That's the champ?
NathanCHubbard	688979739265007616	2016-01-18T07:02:25	1) How did cartel guys get across the US border w/guns for the ambush on the convoy in Sicario? 8 guys shot in front of everyone. No press?
NathanCHubbard	688979617919537152	2016-01-18T07:01:56	Been catching up on movies this weekend. Two things are absolutely haunting me:
NathanCHubbard	688957497516769280	2016-01-18T05:34:02	The one thing more mislabeled than these movies as "musical"/"comedy"/"drama" at awards shows is these candidates as "D's"/"R's" at debates.
NathanCHubbard	688944782748463104	2016-01-18T04:43:30	The Australian Open controls and monitors most of the gambling on the event. Should be the model for the future, unless...the system failed.
NathanCHubbard	688944536253403137	2016-01-18T04:42:32	Pay EXTREMELY close attention. This has important ramifications for the legalization of gambling, fantasy, and more. 
NathanCHubbard	688932069108363264	2016-01-18T03:52:59	Can't wait for this NFL weekend 5 years from now, when I can flip VR helmet/chest cameras from player to player and watch their perspective.

NathanCHubbard	688847819214458880	2016-01-17T22:18:12	This looks like the classic Manning playoff loss game. Missed opportunities early, the crowd tightens up, and the whole team follows.

NathanCHubbard	687680481391808513	2016-01-14T16:59:37	And, uh, I'm tweeting about it.
NathanCHubbard	687680351188041728	2016-01-14T16:59:06	Today my brother HomelessHubbs starts his sophomore year on the PGATOUR, and my sister Simshanley published this:

NathanCHubbard	687082663593656320	2016-01-13T01:24:07	May not be deleting tweets  
NathanCHubbard	687041701030957056	2016-01-12T22:41:20	Say it with me: never, ever retweet praise. Ever.  
NathanCHubbard	687044671231492096	2016-01-12T22:53:08	dougwarf I think they are coming to LA but maybe not for a year.
NathanCHubbard	687044584031952897	2016-01-12T22:52:48	anachtomi No I think Rams and Chargers find a way to make it work.
NathanCHubbard	687043476945420288	2016-01-12T22:48:24	I will probably delete all those tweets in like 24 hours.
NathanCHubbard	687042966309847040	2016-01-12T22:46:22	5) So football is coming back to LA, and as usual, these things start and end w/the real estate. Which Stan Kroenke knows better than most.
NathanCHubbard	687041842366418944	2016-01-12T22:41:54	4) The Raiders, well...this is the downside of years of Mr. Davis' scorched earth strategy. I suspect the 49ers are waiting with open arms.
NathanCHubbard	687041132069400577	2016-01-12T22:39:05	3) The Chargers will be given a year to try to work things out in Inglewood, probably as a tenant with benefits (what that means is TBD).
NathanCHubbard	687040758407245824	2016-01-12T22:37:36	2) The Rams are coming to LA.
NathanCHubbard	687040619810717696	2016-01-12T22:37:03	1) The NFL's Relocation Committee recommendation is ceremonial. Face-saving for the Chargers-Raiders partnership that will dissolve soon.

NathanCHubbard	685960389931094016	2016-01-09T23:04:36	The no. 1 seed in football would be so much cooler if you could pick the team you play in the divisional round from the wildcard winners.
NathanCHubbard	685957785058586624	2016-01-09T22:54:15	Is it weird that the Texans have given up four turnovers in a half and are only down by 13? It's weird, right?
