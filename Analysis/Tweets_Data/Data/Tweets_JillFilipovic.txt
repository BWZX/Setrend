JillFilipovic	722752315548114944	2016-04-20T11:42:34	It doesn't mean Bernie's message is wrong. It means it's short-sighted &amp; insufficient, and knee-jerk defensiveness keeps it stuck.
JillFilipovic	722752083137556480	2016-04-20T11:41:39	That the liberal candidate fighting inequality comes to it in a way that most heavily appeals to white men is not good or sustainable.

JillFilipovic	722750134275207168	2016-04-20T11:33:54	@joetgall sbagen I said he WON "only among white men." That doesn't mean no one else voted for him. Come on, you must know this.
JillFilipovic	722749189399166976	2016-04-20T11:30:09	AviFrey White Marxist men claim it's "universal." Lots of women &amp; POC say it's not. So... that suggests it's not.
JillFilipovic	722748980375986176	2016-04-20T11:29:19	AviFrey Right. Which very much excludes the experiences of women &amp; people of color. There's been a lot written about this re: Marxism.
JillFilipovic	722748689706532864	2016-04-20T11:28:10	It's telling that response of Sanders supporters to his loss among women, POC in NY is basically "But his supporters aren't ALL white men!"
JillFilipovic	722748381982949376	2016-04-20T11:26:56	@joetgall sbagen Of course voters of color cast ballots for Sanders. But far more of them voted for Clinton.
JillFilipovic	722748267902197760	2016-04-20T11:26:29	@joetgall sbagen In New York State, the only demographic group he won was white men. That's not whitewashing anyone.
JillFilipovic	722748000636968960	2016-04-20T11:25:26	AviFrey And I think it's pretty clear his message is not universal if it's not resonating even somewhat equally across race &amp; gender lines
JillFilipovic	722747894869139456	2016-04-20T11:25:00	AviFrey Because he sees the white male experience as the default, as "universal," which race &amp; gender as add-ons.

JillFilipovic	722747337370677248	2016-04-20T11:22:47	seanfw He could focus on broad-based inequalities that are more complex than just money: Racism, sexism, how that impacts status &amp; income.
JillFilipovic	722747212644659200	2016-04-20T11:22:18	seanfw He could include details about how he would actually accomplish anything. Voters over 30 have seen big promises &amp; no action before.
JillFilipovic	722746890228514816	2016-04-20T11:21:01	L_Schmitt_VII I don't deny that many young women are voting Sanders. Most women, though, are above the age of 25.
JillFilipovic	722746662842720256	2016-04-20T11:20:07	Following up on that JillFilipovic tweet, some staggering demographic info from yesterday. 
JillFilipovic	722746746032537600	2016-04-20T11:20:26	seanfw Well, to start, he could have hired more as part of his senior staff.
JillFilipovic	722746658111545345	2016-04-20T11:20:05	AviFrey It's actually not universal. His casting of what "inequality" means is very in line with how white men experience it.

JillFilipovic	722745885025824768	2016-04-20T11:17:01	DashMan18 Well, then you just questioned the decision-making of a majority of female voters and voters of color in New York.
JillFilipovic	722745779174141958	2016-04-20T11:16:36	"Well SOME women and minorities voted for him!" is a defense but it's not a very good one, nor a plan to build a diverse coalition.
JillFilipovic	722745620256137216	2016-04-20T11:15:58	I find much of Sanders' ideology more appealing than Clinton's. I'm turned off by the collective shrug at his lack of appeal to women, POC.
JillFilipovic	722745318115250176	2016-04-20T11:14:46	Can we just stipulate that any time a liberal candidate wins only among white men, that candidate should consider a wider strategy?
JillFilipovic	722745044818595840	2016-04-20T11:13:41	DashMan18 Of course! That's not a concession, it's reality. But most didn't, and his NY base was white men. Weird you don't seem to care.

JillFilipovic	722742928536432640	2016-04-20T11:05:16	DashMan18 No. But he does better with them than with other demographic groups. Women over 30 and people of color lean Clinton. That matters

JillFilipovic	722737560628367360	2016-04-20T10:43:56	DashMan18 So you think everyone except for white men are gullible, misinformed, or uninformed, and that's the problem?
JillFilipovic	722737321179803648	2016-04-20T10:42:59	Clinton won every demographic group except white men. Is this something the Sanders movement should care about?

JillFilipovic	722711772759764992	2016-04-20T09:01:28	JezebelKat Sure, they could have done that. But they wouldn't be counting them now given Clinton's margin of victory.
JillFilipovic	722711251969773569	2016-04-20T08:59:24	JezebelKat And changing rules that have existed since the 70s a week or a few days before a primary isn't exactly "fair."
JillFilipovic	722711105416597504	2016-04-20T08:58:49	JezebelKat NY should look into purged rolls, voting irregularities, etc. But there's no way to "just let them" w/o changing all the rules.

JillFilipovic	722675852572565505	2016-04-20T06:38:44	So... Do these margins mean Hillary Clinton won a moral victory in addition to an actual one, or was that just on the table for Sanders?

JillFilipovic	722423440171483136	2016-04-19T13:55:44	mattkbh As do I. But then what's the point of primaries if they're a free-for-all and not about the party choosing its candidate?
JillFilipovic	722423019734478848	2016-04-19T13:54:04	mattkbh The length of time is going to be arbitrary no matter what. I think it's fair to require more than a day or a week (or a month).
JillFilipovic	722422556893044736	2016-04-19T13:52:14	mattkbh And I don't really care who it helps or hurts; the rules shouldn't be based on that.
JillFilipovic	722422337841340421	2016-04-19T13:51:21	mattkbh I disagree it's anti-democratic. Why should people who are not part of the Democratic party pick the party's nominee?
JillFilipovic	722421363303129093	2016-04-19T13:47:29	AviFrey Gotcha.
JillFilipovic	722420858640326656	2016-04-19T13:45:29	tasentinel Because the point of a primary is for the party to pick its nominee. Same-day changes allow anyone, Republican, whatever.
JillFilipovic	722420559628398593	2016-04-19T13:44:17	AviFrey Ah I misread you, sorry! Yeah, I would say they are also unfair.
JillFilipovic	722420421950365696	2016-04-19T13:43:45	tasentinel I agree NY should allow same-day voter registration. I don't think they should allow same-day party affiliation changes.
JillFilipovic	722420098355617792	2016-04-19T13:42:28	AviFrey Caucuses definitely skew results. Only people who can spend all day get a say (those ppl more likely white, economically stable)
JillFilipovic	722419815126863873	2016-04-19T13:41:20	I can't vote in the GOP primary today (I'm not voting in the Dem primary either, partly because I'm in Kenya). That isn't voter suppression.

JillFilipovic	722387426363195393	2016-04-19T11:32:38	AviFrey Yes. I think they're a terrible idea. Party members should pick their party's nominee, not anyone or interlopers.

JillFilipovic	722346753597575168	2016-04-19T08:51:01	bnyaosi It makes sense because they want voters committed to the Democratic Party. Not people who just want to vote in this one election.
JillFilipovic	722346310423158785	2016-04-19T08:49:15	bnyaosi It's just if you want to change your party affiliation you have to do that 6 months before. These are two different things.
JillFilipovic	722346250536951808	2016-04-19T08:49:01	bnyaosi Luckily you can! If you register 25 days in advance, you can vote in the Dem primary. That seems reasonable.
JillFilipovic	722345836626251777	2016-04-19T08:47:22	NinjaMcCookie And not people who registered the day or month before who are not party members but rather just want to push one candidate?

JillFilipovic	722345160160514048	2016-04-19T08:44:41	bnyaosi And I think open primaries are a bad idea. Other states also have caucuses, which are awful, and others have closed primaries. So?
JillFilipovic	722345030556520448	2016-04-19T08:44:10	Of course we should make it easier for people to register &amp; vote, and some of NY's laws are ridiculous. But not the closed primary rule.

JillFilipovic	722343412687618048	2016-04-19T08:37:44	bnyaosi I meant a legal mechanism by which the court could institute that rule. Also that's not exactly what a semi-closed primary is.
JillFilipovic	722343086010036224	2016-04-19T08:36:26	bnyaosi Well I suspect the Democratic Party in New York determined it. And determined it long before this particular election.
JillFilipovic	722342461440438272	2016-04-19T08:33:57	bnyaosi I don't have a problem with that. The Democratic primary is for Democrats, not people who decided to become Dems five minute ago.

JillFilipovic	719917943883198464	2016-04-12T15:59:47	AsheSchow So your theory is that women choose to get paid less because women don't like money. Ok!

JillFilipovic	719916725102383105	2016-04-12T15:54:57	AsheSchow Yes, some of the gap is from women "choosing" lower-wage female-dominated jobs. But jobs start paying less when women dominate.
JillFilipovic	719916354539806720	2016-04-12T15:53:28	AsheSchow That is demonstrably untrue. A resume with a female name = potential employee is rated as less competent, offered lower salary.

JillFilipovic	715287039546159104	2016-03-30T21:18:14	We know the best way to lower the abortion rate is free accessible reliable contraception. No major American prolife group supports that.

JillFilipovic	715286388699168768	2016-03-30T21:15:39	I'm not saying that because abortion is common it should be legal. I am saying: it's common. Do you believe 1/3 of women are murders?

JillFilipovic	715282810295173121	2016-03-30T21:01:25	I'm fine with that. 
JillFilipovic	715283047147565059	2016-03-30T21:02:22	You don't have to agree with abortion or think it's moral. But if you're working to outlaw it, you'd better think about what that means.

JillFilipovic	715282640333639681	2016-03-30T21:00:45	Spacebunnyday so women should go to jail for having abortions then. At least that's consistent!
JillFilipovic	715281205361577985	2016-03-30T20:55:03	Women have abortions in all corners of the world, and have for nearly all of human history. It is a common, normal part of women's lives.
JillFilipovic	715280821519826945	2016-03-30T20:53:31	There is no correlation between the illegality of abortion &amp; a country's abortion rate. Outlawing it doesn't end it. It makes it dangerous.

JillFilipovic	715278899362590721	2016-03-30T20:45:53	I'm not promoting investigating miscarriages! But I also think abortion should remain legal. If you don't... Think about what that means.

JillFilipovic	715278241360166912	2016-03-30T20:43:16	If abortion is murder, then any claim of miscarriage should be investigated as a potential homicide, the way we investigate if a baby dies.

JillFilipovic	715277484657405953	2016-03-30T20:40:16	If the answer is "because the abortion provider did the abortion," should moms not go to jail if they pay someone to kill their 14-year-old?

JillFilipovic	715276713840787461	2016-03-30T20:37:12	seanmdav yes, if that were actually happening! Not what Trump was talking about. Prolifers think abortion generally should be outlawed, no?

JillFilipovic	715263775293718528	2016-03-30T19:45:47	Except when you make things illegal there are penalties. And if you believe abortion is murder, there should be, no?

JillFilipovic	710180366519296002	2016-03-16T19:06:08	deep_beige MattBruenig There is literally one paragraph in the piece stating the country's gains.

JillFilipovic	710178237444452352	2016-03-16T18:57:40	deep_beige MattBruenig And when Trump says "Make America Great Again," he is talking about a time of great sexism &amp; racism. That matters.
JillFilipovic	710178151582793729	2016-03-16T18:57:20	deep_beige MattBruenig I agree economic inequality persists. I also think racism &amp; sexism persists, but we have made great strides.

JillFilipovic	710177911190528003	2016-03-16T18:56:23	deep_beige MattBruenig So you're right, no, I did not focus on the one single issue you have deemed the most important. Sorry.

JillFilipovic	710177638686576640	2016-03-16T18:55:18	deep_beige MattBruenig The piece was about Trump's slogan, and how America has never been that "great" for most people.

JillFilipovic	710118949741076480	2016-03-16T15:02:05	PaulFidalgo Yes. Which is why Obama didn't nominate someone young &amp; liberal who could be nominated in the future. Let 'em block a centrist.

JillFilipovic	709065517005463556	2016-03-13T17:16:07	MarkARKleiman Agreed. Although I think protest here is important. Do we want to look back from Trump USA and ask why no one protested?
JillFilipovic	709065083960348672	2016-03-13T17:14:24	And yet if there was ever a candidate worthy of protest, it's Trump. Protest is necessary. What's terrifying is he partially benefits.

JillFilipovic	709062994035154946	2016-03-13T17:06:06	To be clear, that isn't an admonishment of the people protesting. Don't want to look back in 2 years and ask, "why did no one protest?"

JillFilipovic	709061545494360065	2016-03-13T17:00:20	So what do you do? You can't sit silently in the face of a candidate like Trump. He is also expert at twisting opposition to his benefit.
JillFilipovic	709061217353142272	2016-03-13T16:59:02	suziegeewizz Oh they have mine too! And people should protest. The whole thing is benefiting Trump though. Which scares me also.
JillFilipovic	709061067008319488	2016-03-13T16:58:26	Which doesn't mean people shouldn't protest. They should. But also Trump wins the longer game when he cancels his rallies. No good solution.
JillFilipovic	709060706000375808	2016-03-13T16:57:00	Trump's campaign appeals to the prejudices &amp; fears of a certain class of white people. Shutting down his rallies plays into those fears.

JillFilipovic	696838381892956160	2016-02-08T23:29:51	Ali_Gharib Agreed. It is sad! Especially in a primary like this one, where there are so many of us who see good in both candidates.

JillFilipovic	684955755234103296	2016-01-07T04:32:32	That got conflated with young women being complacent about abortion rights. Which was dumb. And probably wrong although hard to measure.
JillFilipovic	684955385678184448	2016-01-07T04:31:04	Which is a real thing in the polling numbers. And will matter for abortion rights if young women don't turn out for Clinton in the general.
JillFilipovic	684955030559059968	2016-01-07T04:29:39	I think what's bugging me about the DWS reaction is this: the quote was unclear and was also about Clinton &amp; lack of young female support.
