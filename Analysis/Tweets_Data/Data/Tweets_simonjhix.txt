simonjhix	695230533387882496	2016-02-04T13:00:50	Dan_J_S but in practice PS is irrelevant, as a referendum would be required to leave (not an HoC vote) &amp; while in EU, HoC cannot veto
simonjhix	695229309166968832	2016-02-04T12:55:58	Dan_J_S So you agree that the only way for the HoC to block EU law is to leave. While we stay in EU, the HoC cannot block EU law on its own
