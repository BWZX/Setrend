GeorgeTakei	706708965577523200	2016-03-07T05:12:02	Too doggone cute. 
GeorgeTakei	706693882604425216	2016-03-07T04:12:06	Has it been that long already? 
GeorgeTakei	706688468177575936	2016-03-07T03:50:35	This idea tanked. 
GeorgeTakei	706678788701052929	2016-03-07T03:12:07	I welcome her return if we get more like this. 
GeorgeTakei	706670857045864448	2016-03-07T02:40:36	When you see cake.  
GeorgeTakei	706663670017753088	2016-03-07T02:12:02	Be on the lookout for this epidemic. 
GeorgeTakei	706653245297577984	2016-03-07T01:30:37	The answer is not what the press would have you believe. 
GeorgeTakei	706648589976489984	2016-03-07T01:12:07	This good soul is bringing aid to a maddening situation. 
GeorgeTakei	706635615509553152	2016-03-07T00:20:34	Good for these ladies, getting out of there.  
GeorgeTakei	706633475449757696	2016-03-07T00:12:03	Let's talk about sex baby. 
GeorgeTakei	706618369676431360	2016-03-06T23:12:02	Emma Watson didn't beat around the bush on this one. 
GeorgeTakei	706617983154704386	2016-03-06T23:10:30	Quite drastically, it appears. 
GeorgeTakei	706603267606736897	2016-03-06T22:12:01	Your daily d'awww--just toying around. 
GeorgeTakei	706588170289180673	2016-03-06T21:12:02	Humor is quite organic to this mom. 
GeorgeTakei	706573069142233088	2016-03-06T20:12:01	The over 600 bones discovered will make quite the display when reassembled. 
GeorgeTakei	706557970004316160	2016-03-06T19:12:01	This can't possibly end well. 
GeorgeTakei	706547540536238081	2016-03-06T18:30:35	When you remember there's a test tomorrow and you forgot to study. 
GeorgeTakei	706542873601114112	2016-03-06T18:12:02	No matter what you're poutine on them, they're still delicious. 
GeorgeTakei	706529900698664960	2016-03-06T17:20:29	And here I thought I was old. 
GeorgeTakei	706527781841084416	2016-03-06T17:12:04	For you die-hard Potter fans. You know who you are. 
GeorgeTakei	706512681008652288	2016-03-06T16:12:04	Has it been that long already? Oh Myyy. 
GeorgeTakei	706512285595013120	2016-03-06T16:10:29	Showing off your new haircut.  
GeorgeTakei	706497569921175552	2016-03-06T15:12:01	I haven't seen much of Pamela Anderson in a long while, though I welcome her return if we get more like this. 
GeorgeTakei	706482478001696768	2016-03-06T14:12:03	Parents, be on the lookout for this epidemic. 
GeorgeTakei	706467386975649792	2016-03-06T13:12:05	She's bringing aid to a maddening situation. 
GeorgeTakei	706452293713985537	2016-03-06T12:12:06	It's getting a little hot in here. 
GeorgeTakei	706437179417841665	2016-03-06T11:12:03	She wasn't beating around the bush with this one. 
GeorgeTakei	706422092653133824	2016-03-06T10:12:06	Just toying around.

GeorgeTakei	706361681249579008	2016-03-06T06:12:03	No matter what you're poutine on them, they're still yummy. 
GeorgeTakei	706346575799328769	2016-03-06T05:12:01	For you die-hard Potter fans. 
GeorgeTakei	706331489412083713	2016-03-06T04:12:04	A lot has changed in the past century. 
GeorgeTakei	706326083499651074	2016-03-06T03:50:35	She didn't beat around the bush on this one.  
GeorgeTakei	706316377653547009	2016-03-06T03:12:01	I thought I was old... 
GeorgeTakei	706308467896795136	2016-03-06T02:40:35	When you catch your roommate trying to eat your food in the fridge.  
GeorgeTakei	706301295947153409	2016-03-06T02:12:06	Good for these ladies getting out of there. 
GeorgeTakei	706290860686704642	2016-03-06T01:30:38	What a beautiful human being. 
GeorgeTakei	706286177456816128	2016-03-06T01:12:01	The answer is not what the press would have you believe.                                            
GeorgeTakei	706273231980904448	2016-03-06T00:20:35	Has it been that long already? Oh Myyy.  
GeorgeTakei	706271080709693441	2016-03-06T00:12:02	Something fishy is going on here. 
GeorgeTakei	706255981634674690	2016-03-05T23:12:02	The results may not always be what you expect. 
GeorgeTakei	706255620777906176	2016-03-05T23:10:36	Be warned, this is not for the parent who's faint at heart.  
GeorgeTakei	706240895331336196	2016-03-05T22:12:05	Your daily d'awww--this idea tanked. 
GeorgeTakei	706225792758345728	2016-03-05T21:12:04	As might be expected, I fared a bit better with the older characters on this list. 
GeorgeTakei	706210687664549888	2016-03-05T20:12:03	Spoiler alert: I couldn't believe Ice Cube's death scene in Spotlight. No pun intended. 
GeorgeTakei	706195587104792578	2016-03-05T19:12:03	It's been a while since the isle. 
GeorgeTakei	706185135339773952	2016-03-05T18:30:31	Making sure no one is around when you have to pass gas.  
GeorgeTakei	706180493796986881	2016-03-05T18:12:04	Mamma Mia--I'm waiting for some She-Deviled eggs. 
GeorgeTakei	706167500963241984	2016-03-05T17:20:26	Well that is certainly a new perspective.  
GeorgeTakei	706165405576876032	2016-03-05T17:12:07	It is interesting to see how we stack up to other countries, and how norms have changed. 
GeorgeTakei	706150300738977792	2016-03-05T16:12:05	A lot has changed in the past century, though I think I skewed the average age of marriage. Sorry about that, folks. 
GeorgeTakei	706149889495932929	2016-03-05T16:10:27	Everyone needs a comfy place to lay their head. 
GeorgeTakei	706135185004167168	2016-03-05T15:12:02	And here I thought I was old. 
GeorgeTakei	706120092266819584	2016-03-05T14:12:03	Some of these atrocities are technically harrassment--good for these ladies getting out of there. 
GeorgeTakei	706105001630785541	2016-03-05T13:12:05	I know we are all hoping for a Season 2 cameo. 
GeorgeTakei	706089904187404288	2016-03-05T12:12:06	Something fishy... 
GeorgeTakei	706074793997520896	2016-03-05T11:12:03	Standard of living is very different in other  countries compared with us. 
GeorgeTakei	706059703567011840	2016-03-05T10:12:05	Well, this idea tanked. 
GeorgeTakei	706044587144400896	2016-03-05T09:12:01	I fared a bit better with the older characters on this list. 
GeorgeTakei	706029492821585922	2016-03-05T08:12:03	I couldn't believe Ice Cube's death scene in Spotlight. 
GeorgeTakei	706014400524587008	2016-03-05T07:12:04	Some hidden treasures from a classic show. 
GeorgeTakei	705999290829680641	2016-03-05T06:12:02	I'm waiting for some She-Deviled eggs. 
GeorgeTakei	705984206283747328	2016-03-05T05:12:05	"Perfect" is hardly ever reality, and also highly subjective. 
GeorgeTakei	705969111612858368	2016-03-05T04:12:07	Some should not be left to their own devices. 
GeorgeTakei	705963707453595649	2016-03-05T03:50:38	A Jurassic mess.  
GeorgeTakei	705953991725752320	2016-03-05T03:12:02	They're bringing quagga back. 
GeorgeTakei	705946003887820802	2016-03-05T02:40:17	When someone born in the late 90s claims that they are a "90s Kid."  
GeorgeTakei	705938902914174976	2016-03-05T02:12:04	Impress your friends with this. 
GeorgeTakei	705928502906908672	2016-03-05T01:30:45	You caught them all, now let them go.  
GeorgeTakei	705923789633114112	2016-03-05T01:12:01	There are much more interesting things to talk about if you arm yourself with the right questions. 
GeorgeTakei	705910884690960384	2016-03-05T00:20:44	Time for a trip in a galaxy much closer than you thought.  
GeorgeTakei	705908702558040068	2016-03-05T00:12:04	These were the style of the times--who knows what we'll be seeing stroll down the red carpet ten years from now. 
GeorgeTakei	705893595639738368	2016-03-04T23:12:02	Now we know why we had to catch them all. 
GeorgeTakei	705893250821988352	2016-03-04T23:10:40	Perhaps a nice date night spot? 
GeorgeTakei	705878502386434048	2016-03-04T22:12:04	I wouldn't recommend annoying each other on purpose too much, couples do that enough already by accident. 
GeorgeTakei	705863407065387008	2016-03-04T21:12:05	They end up being a pizza the action, whether they like it or not. 
GeorgeTakei	705848300834926592	2016-03-04T20:12:03	I believe the weight gain bit--my diet has no cruise control when I'm at sea. 
GeorgeTakei	705833209389408256	2016-03-04T19:12:05	I'd love this--it de-panda if Brad approves. 
GeorgeTakei	705822778973413376	2016-03-04T18:30:38	Seeing your crush. 
GeorgeTakei	705818094384476160	2016-03-04T18:12:01	If you didn't realize these when watching, the Jokers on you. 
GeorgeTakei	705805060400406528	2016-03-04T17:20:14	This did a number on me.  
GeorgeTakei	705803001957470208	2016-03-04T17:12:03	No--not that kind of beard. 
GeorgeTakei	705787912399368192	2016-03-04T16:12:05	A few prime examples why some should not be left to their own devices. 
GeorgeTakei	705787546471636992	2016-03-04T16:10:38	When you're bad at dealing with other people's emotions.  
GeorgeTakei	705772819326472192	2016-03-04T15:12:07	They're bringing quagga back. These other zebras don't know how to act. 
GeorgeTakei	705757701607788544	2016-03-04T14:12:03	When you Putin that way it all makes a lot of sense. 
GeorgeTakei	705742617993023488	2016-03-04T13:12:06	Small talk can be awkward for everyone involved. 
GeorgeTakei	705727520105037826	2016-03-04T12:12:07	Who knows what we'll be seeing stroll down the red carpet ten years from now. 
GeorgeTakei	705712415543955456	2016-03-04T11:12:06	Did you hold on to any of yours? 
GeorgeTakei	705697319245590529	2016-03-04T10:12:06	I wouldn't recommend annoying each other on purpose too much. 
GeorgeTakei	705682217146552320	2016-03-04T09:12:06	Being a pizza the action. 
GeorgeTakei	705667120416227329	2016-03-04T08:12:06	Perhaps some cruiseline-employed friends can elaborate more on these. I believe the weight gain bit, though. 
GeorgeTakei	705652004916310018	2016-03-04T07:12:03	I'd love this. 
GeorgeTakei	705636900762071040	2016-03-04T06:12:01	The 'jokes' on you... 
GeorgeTakei	705621824709611520	2016-03-04T05:12:07	Not talking about that kind of beard. 
GeorgeTakei	705606708014395392	2016-03-04T04:12:03	A little bit of war and piece of history to set the facts straight. 
GeorgeTakei	705601253355757572	2016-03-04T03:50:22	It pays to be nice. 
GeorgeTakei	705591623141322752	2016-03-04T03:12:06	After some adjustments these are correct. 
GeorgeTakei	705583618597457920	2016-03-04T02:40:18	When mom says dinner won't be ready for another hour.  
GeorgeTakei	705576514989871104	2016-03-04T02:12:04	A dangerous bill with both sexist and classist motivations. I hope this will be dismissed as predicted. 
GeorgeTakei	705565988583022593	2016-03-04T01:30:15	I think it's time for a vacation.  
GeorgeTakei	705561420964859904	2016-03-04T01:12:06	Beyond suggestions and sympathy, the most important sentiment is support. 
GeorgeTakei	705548373722578944	2016-03-04T00:20:15	And you thought your job was tough. 
GeorgeTakei	705546301820145664	2016-03-04T00:12:01	It would be much funnier if I could ignore the undercurrent of harsh reality. 
GeorgeTakei	705531205110755328	2016-03-03T23:12:02	Straight from the source--the struggles of being an introvert, as ranked by introverts, themselves. 
GeorgeTakei	705530780294975489	2016-03-03T23:10:20	It's hypnotic.  
GeorgeTakei	705516107239526400	2016-03-03T22:12:02	Great beauty and great danger are not mutually exclusive. 
GeorgeTakei	705501026816659457	2016-03-03T21:12:07	Sorry to let everyone down, but it doesn't look like either side is ever going to give up on this one. 
GeorgeTakei	705485905402855424	2016-03-03T20:12:01	This barista takes the term 'service' to heart. What new experience can we have to better serve those around us? 
GeorgeTakei	705470805329575936	2016-03-03T19:12:01	I don't think this plea will have the result he was hoping for. 
GeorgeTakei	705460301584580608	2016-03-03T18:30:17	When your SO takes up most of the bed.  
GeorgeTakei	705455723967225858	2016-03-03T18:12:05	The reality behind 'reality' TV--sorry if this bursts anyone's bubble. 
GeorgeTakei	705442782131912704	2016-03-03T17:20:40	For those who idealize the past. 
GeorgeTakei	705440621712965633	2016-03-03T17:12:05	Everything's batter in cookie cutter shapes.

GeorgeTakei	705410429506355200	2016-03-03T15:12:06	A few adjustments in pronunciation, but largely correct. 
GeorgeTakei	705395324299292672	2016-03-03T14:12:05	A dangerous bill with both sexist and classist motivations, with a bit of victim shaming to boot.

GeorgeTakei	705244313949597696	2016-03-03T04:12:01	Warning--this may be too hot for parents to handle. "I've never called one of these hotlines before." Oh myyy. 
GeorgeTakei	705238893839388672	2016-03-03T03:50:29	Make sure you tip so you don't end up on this list. 
GeorgeTakei	705229224114663424	2016-03-03T03:12:04	Showing less clothes on your models doesn't always earn you extra points with customers.

GeorgeTakei	705214130584616962	2016-03-03T02:12:05	Just because you can, doesn't mean you should, friends. 
GeorgeTakei	705203712340398080	2016-03-03T01:30:41	Glad to know these myths have been busted.
