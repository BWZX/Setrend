tristanwalker	707403771760906245	2016-03-09T03:12:56	PeterAbraham that means nothing to me. General election means billions. Billions! And it'll be both dem and repub money against trump

tristanwalker	707402563172245504	2016-03-09T03:08:08	marcprecipice yep. Exactly the point. Something dems and repubs can get behind. It's the only strategic move that I can see will work
tristanwalker	707402375410024449	2016-03-09T03:07:23	abradyj I know that. My thinking still applies. Would love to see him loan billions and not raise any money against it. Lose it all Donald
tristanwalker	707402145645998080	2016-03-09T03:06:29	marcprecipice I doubt it honestly. In support of trump? Establishment republicans hate him
tristanwalker	707402049147678721	2016-03-09T03:06:06	angela_rye who's going to fund that man to the tune of billions of dollars?

tristanwalker	707400969865207808	2016-03-09T03:01:48	Spending money during the primary is one thing. During the general election? Completely different beast.
tristanwalker	707400476845694976	2016-03-09T02:59:51	That risk to him would have to be one thing that will trap Trump. Dems billions vs Trumps own millions. Does he want the office THAT much?
tristanwalker	707400086074974208	2016-03-09T02:58:18	Seems like democrats need to raise the *superest* of pacs and spend as much money as possible to force trump to lose *all* of his money
