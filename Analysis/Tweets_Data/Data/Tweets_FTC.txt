FTC	689549828754382848	2016-01-19T20:47:45	Sheltrown: Allow direct distribution. If it doesn't work, firms that use it won't survive. FTCauto
FTC	689545462035120129	2016-01-19T20:30:23	Prof. Crane: How to find out if direct distrib'n leads to savings? Let market answer the question. (Economics suggests it will.) FTCauto
FTC	689544223234859011	2016-01-19T20:25:28	Prof. Dan Crane UMich: Consumers best off when mfct's choose their distribution model. Important dimension of competition. FTCauto

FTC	689499701486325761	2016-01-19T17:28:33	If warranty laws were loosened, would market forces adequately protect consumers? Or would access, quality, prices suffer? FTCauto
FTC	689498452070236160	2016-01-19T17:23:35	Do over-the-air software updates change the nature of repairs? Or do security concerns still require physical visit to the dealer? FTCauto

FTC	689489406449704960	2016-01-19T16:47:39	Prof. David Sappington UF: "Competition is the ideal form of consumer protection." Use regulation only if there is market failure. FTCauto
FTC	689488518066778117	2016-01-19T16:44:07	Goldberg: As quality of cars improved, dealers used political leverage to protect warranty revenues/profits. FTCauto

FTC	689475369812910080	2016-01-19T15:51:52	Prof. Schneider: Regs determine how to allocate $ between mfct's, dealers, consumers. Current regs weighted toward dealers. FTCauto
FTC	689473965325099009	2016-01-19T15:46:17	Do termination regs promote careful, deliberate decisions? Or do they slow things down too much, make it hard for mfcts to react? FTCauto
