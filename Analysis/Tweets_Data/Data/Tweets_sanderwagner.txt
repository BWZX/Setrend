sanderwagner	724347836146524161	2016-04-24T21:22:36	AbeLolisted and those do not qualify you for studies at uni later on, whereas abitur/matura implies high proba of uni studies afterwards
sanderwagner	724347681628393472	2016-04-24T21:21:59	AbeLolisted right, matura and abitur even more, just bc there is other highschool-like diplomas on lower strat paths
sanderwagner	724347234020671488	2016-04-24T21:20:12	AbeLolisted MaxCRoser big difference is that our high school systems stratify v early so reaching matura/abitur is not possible for many
sanderwagner	724345437042434048	2016-04-24T21:13:04	AbeLolisted MaxCRoser it's like German abitur more or less
sanderwagner	724345168493686784	2016-04-24T21:12:00	jfalbertos esoltas tha would be my view
sanderwagner	724345033382629376	2016-04-24T21:11:28	esoltas all of which is worrying, but worth keeping in mind self-correcting mechanisms of systems as well for such situations
sanderwagner	724344850561282048	2016-04-24T21:10:44	esoltas re: austria, you might get a similar result in france w FN winning first round and losing run-off
sanderwagner	724342114474176514	2016-04-24T20:59:52	esoltas on things like financial integration of EZ hopefully
sanderwagner	724342028914536449	2016-04-24T20:59:31	esoltas so the ebbing off of the refugee stream which appears to happen so far will reduce the pressure and conflict and allow to refocus
sanderwagner	724341869749112833	2016-04-24T20:58:54	esoltas I would have wished for the EU to react with more open arms, but I guess we are discussing whether the institutions will hold
sanderwagner	724341593600303105	2016-04-24T20:57:48	esoltas and a politically less chaotic way out of the crisis seems somewhat feasible
sanderwagner	724341478743486466	2016-04-24T20:57:20	esoltas that said for moment being the numbers of refugee arrivals have fallen sharply over the course of this year 
sanderwagner	724341076685930500	2016-04-24T20:55:44	esoltas and if it doesn't happen how the countries will deal with the fallout
sanderwagner	724340948604432384	2016-04-24T20:55:14	esoltas if the deal w Turkey breaks apart, there is real doubt on whether there is the will to find a solution within EU apparatus
sanderwagner	724340721973604352	2016-04-24T20:54:20	esoltas yes, the refugee issue opened up some pretty big fissures in the functioning of EU and some problematic reflexes

sanderwagner	724339312502923264	2016-04-24T20:48:44	esoltas Spring of Nations... makes today's many worries in the EU seem almost tiny when you think about it!
sanderwagner	724338909501632512	2016-04-24T20:47:08	esoltas i am mildly optimistic about eastern europe coming back into the fold of (more or less) functioning EU in the medium term though
sanderwagner	724338456357396481	2016-04-24T20:45:20	esoltas if you look at my last name you can prob figure that i am from a country with a lot more to be apologetic for historically
sanderwagner	724337739634728960	2016-04-24T20:42:29	esoltas authoritarian parties in eastern europe are worrying, brexit is a real risk (even though it's proba is abt 15% in my book)
sanderwagner	724335896045215744	2016-04-24T20:35:09	esoltas german politics is very consensus driven, an outright split btw a party and sisterparty is not what the system usually produces
sanderwagner	724335504758546432	2016-04-24T20:33:36	esoltas leaving the gvt however would result in a more pronounced split w cdu and hurt their numbers in bavaria in the long term
sanderwagner	724335303281008640	2016-04-24T20:32:48	esoltas they have leverage about policy direction and Merkel has changed policy direction a fair bit
sanderwagner	724334282978824192	2016-04-24T20:28:45	esoltas seehofer positions himself against refugees publically but there is really no indication of any plans of pulling out thus far
sanderwagner	724334033883242497	2016-04-24T20:27:45	esoltas the refugee numbers arriving in the country are down a lot, and csu would lose a lot from a real fallout w sisterparty
sanderwagner	724333878463352832	2016-04-24T20:27:08	esoltas i would bet against that at pretty favourable rates
sanderwagner	724332335521509379	2016-04-24T20:21:00	esoltas even if SPD/CDU fractures, it would lead to a SPD led left-leaning gvt, nothing resembling authoritarianism
sanderwagner	724331975604101120	2016-04-24T20:19:35	esoltas I just don't see it as a very likely scenario. Brexit and institutional fracturing in EU bodies seem like immediate worries

sanderwagner	722771652820529152	2016-04-20T12:59:25	GavinHJackson i would have wished for more stimulus and less leniency; think people underestimated neg cost of radical grexit solutions tho

sanderwagner	720223797773737984	2016-04-13T12:15:09	TheStalwart obviously that's all assuming a sudden rather than a smooth transition to the (non-)Salomon regime
sanderwagner	720223628428750849	2016-04-13T12:14:28	TheStalwart and then the other issue i would see in favour of felix's point is the transition unempoyment of all the gvt employees

sanderwagner	719888646728523776	2016-04-12T14:03:22	adamcarstens no, but i think people are underestimating the likelihood of it

sanderwagner	719888312777854976	2016-04-12T14:02:03	adamcarstens yea on 2nd + ballot DTs chances start being pretty slim
sanderwagner	719888142816436225	2016-04-12T14:01:22	adamcarstens can we call this the ... wagner scenario :)
sanderwagner	719887930014216194	2016-04-12T14:00:32	adamcarstens yes its actually a fairly likely scenario, since he might get v close to 1237 and then get some PA or other unbound
sanderwagner	719887505672314881	2016-04-12T13:58:50	adamcarstens I thought for the carstens scenario to kick in its already enough if he's under 1237 without CA
sanderwagner	719883128593100800	2016-04-12T13:41:27	would of course particularly matter under the Carstens scenario cc adamcarstens

sanderwagner	719174128981381120	2016-04-10T14:44:08	ibexsalad GavinHJackson macro is too esoteric even for sociologists :p
sanderwagner	719173674998349824	2016-04-10T14:42:20	ibexsalad GavinHJackson depends, but yea, theoretical crossover mostly micro, empirical labour or microeconometrics
sanderwagner	719172477914636288	2016-04-10T14:37:34	GavinHJackson you can do that in academia too, but of course you are evaluated in a social space of peers, as outside academia too
sanderwagner	719172216076832768	2016-04-10T14:36:32	grodaeu GavinHJackson yea for me its also complicated because the area i am in touches a lot on sociology, demography and econ
sanderwagner	719171393917698049	2016-04-10T14:33:16	GavinHJackson which is the social space my life and the language definitions I am confronted with play out in
sanderwagner	719171283884318720	2016-04-10T14:32:50	GavinHJackson because they are about what departments and journals people will want to be in
sanderwagner	719171175197368322	2016-04-10T14:32:24	GavinHJackson don't know, i don't think about it much, for me, questions like is someonse a sociologist a psychologist etc are relevant
sanderwagner	719170909270093824	2016-04-10T14:31:20	GavinHJackson and also out of the simplicity of not revolting against consensus language which is not my agenda
sanderwagner	719170730471112705	2016-04-10T14:30:38	GavinHJackson i generally do, because the positions require much of the toolbox bestowed by economist training and its application
sanderwagner	719170591161454597	2016-04-10T14:30:05	GavinHJackson in empirical studies never let the perfect be the enemy of the good ;)
sanderwagner	719170457761673216	2016-04-10T14:29:33	GavinHJackson right its the best recourse we have given our divergent opinions though
sanderwagner	719170133395116033	2016-04-10T14:28:15	GavinHJackson shall we solve this by means of twitter poll?
sanderwagner	719169209096388608	2016-04-10T14:24:35	GavinHJackson but we can agree that on current consensus, most ppl including probably gladwell himself wouldn't call him an economist?
sanderwagner	719169094830985218	2016-04-10T14:24:08	GavinHJackson i mean i don't have a problem w your reformist language agenda
sanderwagner	719168809253367809	2016-04-10T14:23:00	GavinHJackson the guy ranting in the pub about how the UK economy is headed for the gutter might as well apply, he is popularizing
sanderwagner	719168623764467716	2016-04-10T14:22:16	GavinHJackson sure, but then how far do you want to take the anti-credentialist push against current language norms
sanderwagner	719167576476151809	2016-04-10T14:18:06	GavinHJackson well its also that if you call a science writer a physicits biologist and chemist at once, language gets terribly messed up
sanderwagner	719166930788229120	2016-04-10T14:15:32	GavinHJackson but its less clear for these than in the case of Gladwell who is not even mainly focussed on econ
sanderwagner	719166798432755712	2016-04-10T14:15:00	GavinHJackson so I probably wouldn't say that
sanderwagner	719166732351483904	2016-04-10T14:14:45	GavinHJackson is Bill Bryson a physicist?
sanderwagner	719166261104652288	2016-04-10T14:12:52	GavinHJackson it seems to be the language consensus i have been exposed to, even more so if the popularizers cover many fields
sanderwagner	719165546521104385	2016-04-10T14:10:02	GavinHJackson i think stiff rules for language tend to miss evolving consensus nature, but glad you're w the academie francaise
sanderwagner	719165361694879744	2016-04-10T14:09:18	GavinHJackson the language consensus for example would be Levitt-economist Dubner- not really
sanderwagner	719165214986526721	2016-04-10T14:08:43	GavinHJackson most of the time its fairly obvious, but the popularizing writers general do not get assigned the term of the discipline
sanderwagner	719165000854716417	2016-04-10T14:07:52	GavinHJackson i don't have one, there is a multitude of criteria demarcating an academic reference space
sanderwagner	719164229618675714	2016-04-10T14:04:48	GavinHJackson ok
sanderwagner	719163114277773312	2016-04-10T14:00:22	TofGovaerts GavinHJackson agree, even though wealth of nations hads some decent passages
sanderwagner	719162833037082627	2016-04-10T13:59:15	GavinHJackson because that's what would logically follow, none of these areas are touched that much more or less than econ in his writing
sanderwagner	719162698966163456	2016-04-10T13:58:43	GavinHJackson is gladwell a social psychologist, economist and sociologist at the same time in your book?
sanderwagner	719162471773270016	2016-04-10T13:57:49	GavinHJackson yea, he is somewhere in between economist and moral philosopher, still if Gladwell is an economist Cameron is too
sanderwagner	719161847358844928	2016-04-10T13:55:20	GavinHJackson partially, gladwell doesn't make his living writing about economics, its part of what he writes about not even 50%
sanderwagner	719161496073289728	2016-04-10T13:53:56	GavinHJackson i mean if the criteria are that open, Cameron might be the most well-known economists, he talks about the economy a lot
sanderwagner	719160880760496129	2016-04-10T13:51:29	GavinHJackson ok, nevermind. everyone's an economist, srry
sanderwagner	719160711281319936	2016-04-10T13:50:49	GavinHJackson well Kahneman is not an economist for me either he is just highly relevant for econ
sanderwagner	719160543945342978	2016-04-10T13:50:09	GavinHJackson he writes about social sciences, probably more social psychology than econ in his books overall
sanderwagner	719160121402748928	2016-04-10T13:48:28	Pete_Spence PreachyPreach i think 2-5 out of 100 could name Krugman more or less
sanderwagner	719159911284916224	2016-04-10T13:47:38	GavinHJackson Pete_Spence can't aruge with a radical subjectivist i guess
sanderwagner	719159439950000130	2016-04-10T13:45:46	GavinHJackson Pete_Spence malcolm gladwell is not an economist in my book. Has history degree and publicizes research from social sciences

sanderwagner	718023207715008513	2016-04-07T10:30:47	GavinHJackson but then again, that that's a necessary precondition kinda shows that maybe the debates are not such a great thing after all
sanderwagner	718023076038967296	2016-04-07T10:30:16	GavinHJackson yea, when i do my yoga regularly, twitter is much better, basically what happens in debates doesn't get at me emotionally
sanderwagner	718022300294062081	2016-04-07T10:27:11	GavinHJackson right, that's the problem, my own uncomfortableness with who I am and how i react in certain situation, that's all
sanderwagner	718021962031886337	2016-04-07T10:25:50	GavinHJackson it's mainly insta-interaction and gut reactions/emotions on my side that are the problem
sanderwagner	718021837557526528	2016-04-07T10:25:20	GavinHJackson naah it's not anon trolls that make it complicated, and most people i interact with i don't know that well anyways.
sanderwagner	718021618811985920	2016-04-07T10:24:28	GavinHJackson and i don't enjoy it very much
sanderwagner	718021530509250560	2016-04-07T10:24:07	GavinHJackson that takes over and that's not very helpful to developing clear ideas or honestly revising my own that takes over
sanderwagner	718021413026791424	2016-04-07T10:23:39	GavinHJackson if it gets adversarial there is an uncomfortable adrenaline part that is probably part of my biological status programming
sanderwagner	718021277504651265	2016-04-07T10:23:07	GavinHJackson yea, but i only enjoy this if it happens in a cordial way were both are thinking together and playing through ideas

sanderwagner	718020825891414017	2016-04-07T10:21:19	GavinHJackson seriously considering just consuming and putting up stuff  but not discussing anymore, increasingly uncomfortable with my own
sanderwagner	718020488967094272	2016-04-07T10:19:59	GavinHJackson yea i suck at twitter and I am increasingly uncomfortable with it, particular discussions
sanderwagner	718018794438987776	2016-04-07T10:13:15	GavinHJackson i was talking about myself

sanderwagner	718015036439011328	2016-04-07T09:58:19	bswud mapping out genres is such a complex and probably as time passes increasingly futile endeavour anyways
sanderwagner	718014469989867520	2016-04-07T09:56:04	bswud then again bluegrass, big band, definitely relatively low in totals
sanderwagner	718014315228479488	2016-04-07T09:55:27	bswud interesting, because for example pop for sure has a much bigger listener base than classic, but not even sure abt release numbers
sanderwagner	718013904673234944	2016-04-07T09:53:49	bswud right, so electronic music as in what we mostly listen to is absent
sanderwagner	718013336777043968	2016-04-07T09:51:34	bswud it's also a very American decision :)
sanderwagner	718013243348885504	2016-04-07T09:51:11	bswud yea, that's a terrible substitute though. Basically replaced a bigger genre I am v fond of by a much worse (on avg) subgenre

sanderwagner	716968743662981121	2016-04-04T12:40:43	bswud don't disagree with that, but a huge amount of what is happening here is people moving money out of the tax-base which is problematic

sanderwagner	716967787684618240	2016-04-04T12:36:55	bswud but the more open the data is the less government abuse of it becomes likely as well

sanderwagner	712331178292977664	2016-03-22T17:32:42	GavinHJackson grodaeu i think we agree, except that I see this as caused by birth and fatherhood and am fine w terminology
sanderwagner	712331042280050688	2016-03-22T17:32:09	GavinHJackson grodaeu right

sanderwagner	712330730634870784	2016-03-22T17:30:55	@sanderwagner@grodaeu at least that would be my hunch
sanderwagner	712330655208755200	2016-03-22T17:30:37	GavinHJackson grodaeu right, it has to do with bargaining in the household that ensues and signals to teh employer
sanderwagner	712330475944218624	2016-03-22T17:29:54	GavinHJackson grodaeu well, but you are aguing that the effects is mediated, not that it doesn't exist then, no?
sanderwagner	712329510880976897	2016-03-22T17:26:04	GavinHJackson grodaeu I have results on fathers wages going up on twin-birth compared to non-twinbirth in DK

sanderwagner	712328967357931520	2016-03-22T17:23:54	Molto_Vivace_88 probably matter more. Plus really different gender role norms
sanderwagner	712328877880832000	2016-03-22T17:23:33	Molto_Vivace_88 this is percentage change, still might be part of the effect, but 90% labour market integration vs 50% and childcare diffs
sanderwagner	712328681377681409	2016-03-22T17:22:46	grodaeu different paper, has nothing on fathers, since you asked I started looking in the literature
sanderwagner	712328534451220481	2016-03-22T17:22:11	EquityIvan GavinHJackson grodaeu it would count into most estimates, because they are not hour adjusted, yes
sanderwagner	712328295522701313	2016-03-22T17:21:14	grodaeu you are referring to something in the paper, not the graph right?
sanderwagner	712328162240233472	2016-03-22T17:20:42	MayfairCynic its badly expressed, it's a log-linear regression, so the coefficient gives percentage change, sorry
sanderwagner	712327997441875968	2016-03-22T17:20:03	grodaeu sorry what are population A and B?
sanderwagner	712327852839071745	2016-03-22T17:19:29	GavinHJackson grodaeu but we find fatherhood wage premiums in almost all countries
sanderwagner	712327768436908032	2016-03-22T17:19:09	GavinHJackson grodaeu well it's the effect of having children on wages and in sweden it differs by occupational prestige
sanderwagner	712327104759775232	2016-03-22T17:16:30	GavinHJackson grodaeu yea, they divorce at much lower levels of marital satisfaction, but i am not sure how that plays into this
sanderwagner	712326914309038081	2016-03-22T17:15:45	GavinHJackson grodaeu and in many cases lifestyle choices, so is it unfair to call it the motherhood wage penalty?
sanderwagner	712326794507132928	2016-03-22T17:15:16	GavinHJackson grodaeu i mean the motherhood penalty is about a lot of things as well, caretaking, but also signals of time availability
sanderwagner	712326618627362816	2016-03-22T17:14:34	GavinHJackson grodaeu well fundamentally we don't know what it is about, but we observe it after fatherhood
sanderwagner	712325886532521984	2016-03-22T17:11:40	GavinHJackson grodaeu right and then it obviously depends on the financial support fathers do continue to provide etc.
sanderwagner	712325277389615104	2016-03-22T17:09:15	GavinHJackson grodaeu my hunch would be you'd find nothing or negative effects, also bec incapable to properly control, but i don't know
sanderwagner	712325151317217281	2016-03-22T17:08:45	GavinHJackson grodaeu would be an interesting case study, to disentangle mechanics behind fatherhood wage premium
sanderwagner	712324515825586176	2016-03-22T17:06:13	grodaeu fatherhood generally works as a strong signal for comittment, reliability and low mobility and thus has value to employers
sanderwagner	712321530143842304	2016-03-22T16:54:21	grodaeu that is from this article 
sanderwagner	712321399629746176	2016-03-22T16:53:50	grodaeu so for very high prestige jobs it gets to be around 20% 
sanderwagner	712319958898884609	2016-03-22T16:48:07	grodaeu it was already partially there before the divide, but gotten much stronger, by differences in childcare and labour integration

sanderwagner	712316624829857793	2016-03-22T16:34:52	grodaeu don't have them at hand, but its mostly a premium
sanderwagner	712313980140789760	2016-03-22T16:24:21	oditorium or selection into the labour market rather, but W Germany remains super male-breadwinner whereas E Germany is v different
sanderwagner	712313809608663040	2016-03-22T16:23:41	oditorium right, i mean they compare mothers with non-mother wages, it gets weaker once you control for labour market participation
sanderwagner	712313542016258048	2016-03-22T16:22:37	oditorium 
sanderwagner	712313513822257153	2016-03-22T16:22:30	oditorium its a log-level regression, here you can look up the derivation of how to interpret the coefficient
sanderwagner	712312348896317440	2016-03-22T16:17:52	oditorium they are regressing on a logged variable so the marginal effect captured by the coefficient is a percentage change
sanderwagner	712312052031823872	2016-03-22T16:16:41	oditorium no it actually means motherhood implies a 50% wage reduction on average in the west and a 12% wage reduction in the east
sanderwagner	712311367840223234	2016-03-22T16:13:58	ewatterbjork 
sanderwagner	712311318720675841	2016-03-22T16:13:47	ewatterbjork that way they can account for differential selection of mothers into labour markets
sanderwagner	712311104358080513	2016-03-22T16:12:56	ewatterbjork Heckman did not write this, they are using a heckman selection model
sanderwagner	712310998447697920	2016-03-22T16:12:30	oditorium badly written by me and authors, dependent variable is log earnings I guess, so its the percentage effect of motherhood on wage
sanderwagner	712309750004842496	2016-03-22T16:07:33	Recent estimates of motherhood wage penalty (% of log earnings). East- vs West-Germany diff remains stunning

sanderwagner	709075761005776896	2016-03-13T17:56:50	adamcarstens yup and its PR vote that matters most , even though sometimes parties do profit and get extra seat through mandates
sanderwagner	709075525478817796	2016-03-13T17:55:53	adamcarstens but it can be that a candidate gets pushed in through an unexpected direct mandate or a candidate w a party under 5% gets in
sanderwagner	709075272822345728	2016-03-13T17:54:53	adamcarstens normally the winning district candidates are on top in the party lists for proportional seats as well
sanderwagner	709075133680492548	2016-03-13T17:54:20	adamcarstens in practice its a little more complicated because you do vote for representatives in your district as well

sanderwagner	707587549947105280	2016-03-09T15:23:12	GavinHJackson even for explaining: strenght of causal link of x and y reduces your degrees of freedom in speculating on strength of paths

sanderwagner	707584119627247616	2016-03-09T15:09:35	GavinHJackson sure when i think about whether x has a causal effect on y that doesn't mean a unique causal pathway at all
sanderwagner	707583806975430656	2016-03-09T15:08:20	GavinHJackson and a point on two strong correlates we have geographically w Trump voting: google searches for 'n...er' and white mortality
sanderwagner	707583493371523072	2016-03-09T15:07:05	GavinHJackson one more graph 
sanderwagner	707581930301161473	2016-03-09T15:00:53	GavinHJackson sure it has an effect too, i think it was in the original list to which i agreed and added some points
sanderwagner	707580998532333568	2016-03-09T14:57:10	GavinHJackson but I am also willing to revise the way I think, so what is a good way to go about thinking about these things?
sanderwagner	707580902088564736	2016-03-09T14:56:47	GavinHJackson I am just trying to think about a world w causal links in a careful highly uncertain way that I am willing to revise
sanderwagner	707580340739710976	2016-03-09T14:54:34	GavinHJackson and again, i see this as a factor in a complicated story, not as an explanatory var getting at most variance
sanderwagner	707580111193776129	2016-03-09T14:53:39	GavinHJackson something dry wood, match... but i am willing to hear how your perceptions story gets a better time fit
sanderwagner	707579747589558277	2016-03-09T14:52:12	GavinHJackson so i don't think its the main driver, but i think it matters partially as does perception of class, status and race
sanderwagner	707579322966679553	2016-03-09T14:50:31	GavinHJackson its strange to make your original case based on data then, and to remember your original conviction when the data doesnt fit
sanderwagner	707578444020850688	2016-03-09T14:47:01	GavinHJackson have changed my opinion on topics based on data, find it useful for that, but i agree on the prevalence of the phenomenon
sanderwagner	707578188197662720	2016-03-09T14:46:00	GavinHJackson recapture: you started an argument based on UK data, I posted newer and better estimations, you concluded data don't matter
sanderwagner	707577780494581761	2016-03-09T14:44:23	GavinHJackson you have that w data too, but at least there are some more checks and a more inferential logic to theory building
sanderwagner	707577674500149249	2016-03-09T14:43:58	GavinHJackson i am not against that, but you end up in a world where everyone tells stories fitting their pet theories pretty fast
sanderwagner	707577524482658304	2016-03-09T14:43:22	GavinHJackson BTabrum isn't that partially connected though? And what is your definition of it?
sanderwagner	707577331179716608	2016-03-09T14:42:36	GavinHJackson our stats are a lame attempt to capture that, but hey gotta go with what you got
sanderwagner	707577225042903040	2016-03-09T14:42:11	GavinHJackson for that both the reporting and of course their actual paycheck and opportunity structure matter
sanderwagner	707577073842446336	2016-03-09T14:41:35	GavinHJackson neither w ur data, what matters is whether they feel they are stagnating and whether they feel like elites are gaining
sanderwagner	707576857781256196	2016-03-09T14:40:43	BTabrum GavinHJackson even though focus on these factors soemtiles blurs extent to which he ampligies &amp; uses pre-existing racial animosity
sanderwagner	707576644198862848	2016-03-09T14:39:52	BTabrum GavinHJackson on the socioecon stagnation part of trump support his is interesting 
sanderwagner	707576274877870081	2016-03-09T14:38:24	GavinHJackson BTabrum steve jenkins is generally quite excellent on the UK data
sanderwagner	707576061652033541	2016-03-09T14:37:33	GavinHJackson BTabrum there have been some recent corrections to that view 
sanderwagner	707575263928971265	2016-03-09T14:34:23	BTabrum GavinHJackson add to that a GOP which has moved away from voter preferences socioeconomically by libertarian donour class
sanderwagner	707575000111382528	2016-03-09T14:33:20	GavinHJackson BTabrum been back up pretty fast, plus trend over last 30 years is more than clear
sanderwagner	707574865763700736	2016-03-09T14:32:48	BTabrum GavinHJackson + feeling of corrupt elites which are primarily interested in enriching themselves and cannot be trusted
sanderwagner	707574446945652736	2016-03-09T14:31:08	BTabrum GavinHJackson onboard w crisis, recession, inequality, would add a lot of pre-existing racism partially amplified by stagnation
sanderwagner	707572520514416640	2016-03-09T14:23:29	BTabrum GavinHJackson weird mix of disenfranchisement on different levels feeding us vs them instincts on racial and socioeconomic axes
sanderwagner	707572149255589888	2016-03-09T14:22:01	GavinHJackson BTabrum FN has also really high support among young people if this is how we split it, they are out too
sanderwagner	707572062433452032	2016-03-09T14:21:40	GavinHJackson BTabrum i think he was not sorting by age or political direction, but by his perception of demagoguery
sanderwagner	707571761030762496	2016-03-09T14:20:28	GavinHJackson BTabrum he is winning the lowly educated, but also the highly educated w smaller margins. The phenomenon is quite big.
sanderwagner	707571613219344384	2016-03-09T14:19:53	GavinHJackson BTabrum so education and geography and disenfranchisement all work as explanatory variables to a limited extent
sanderwagner	707570491935100928	2016-03-09T14:15:25	GavinHJackson BTabrum if this is abt Trump, his supporters are on avg less religious than party mean, if this is abt Corbyn well no clue

sanderwagner	700323237591298050	2016-02-18T14:17:25	adamcarstens seems to refer to vote on candidate, this is reference market

sanderwagner	700222815014932480	2016-02-18T07:38:23	AbeLolisted sure, but don't see left staying home if he's the candidate, distaste for the other side often stronger than appetite for own
sanderwagner	700222574136053761	2016-02-18T07:37:25	AbeLolisted low approval ratings and nevertheless high turnout driven by anymosity twds other side
sanderwagner	700222313783037952	2016-02-18T07:36:23	AbeLolisted it's how harry reid won nevada
sanderwagner	700222255217975296	2016-02-18T07:36:09	AbeLolisted think if cruz is the candidate the left will turn out for hillary despite her flaws, distaste of opponent is quite the force
sanderwagner	700220246121119744	2016-02-18T07:28:10	AbeLolisted so i think either of them would probably lose, but cruz more likely to, interesting that you see it so differently
sanderwagner	700219589779701760	2016-02-18T07:25:34	AbeLolisted both trump and cruz are v flawed general candidates, but imo cruz makes a dem general election much more certain still, no?
sanderwagner	700218676444864512	2016-02-18T07:21:56	AbeLolisted quite possibly, but expect the funky bunch to stick around til the end, so that increases trump's odds
sanderwagner	700218255827431424	2016-02-18T07:20:16	AbeLolisted a really crushing Cruz defeat might reign in the tea party ambitiousness a bit and make the republicans more cooperative again
sanderwagner	700217973118787584	2016-02-18T07:19:08	AbeLolisted i agree that Trump is less awful than cruz, otoh cruz is more definitely getting crushed in the general
sanderwagner	700217562056024065	2016-02-18T07:17:30	AbeLolisted South Carolina is an interesting bellweather already, expect Cruz to strongly outperform polls but Trump to still carry it
sanderwagner	700216589673742336	2016-02-18T07:13:39	AbeLolisted one out of three national polls yday though, other two: Trump +15 and Trump +20
