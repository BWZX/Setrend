mgerrydoyle	699802205126197248	2016-02-17T03:47:02	badnetworker SharlynEgger fair enough. I can get behind that.
mgerrydoyle	699801985856331776	2016-02-17T03:46:09	SharlynEgger badnetworker I'm not saying we shouldn't do anything. I'm saying we shouldn't bother taking anti-vax beliefs into account
mgerrydoyle	699801828070850560	2016-02-17T03:45:32	badnetworker SharlynEgger but I don't think that's taking their irrational beliefs into account.
mgerrydoyle	699801734311342080	2016-02-17T03:45:09	badnetworker SharlynEgger I can buy that.
mgerrydoyle	699801670155313152	2016-02-17T03:44:54	badnetworker SharlynEgger it's gotta be mandated, imo.
mgerrydoyle	699801451032219649	2016-02-17T03:44:02	SharlynEgger badnetworker but their beliefs are just as irrational. and we don't listen to them because if we DID, danger results.
mgerrydoyle	699801223528996864	2016-02-17T03:43:08	SharlynEgger badnetworker how can you change the mind of someone who has willfully rejected science, evidence, and reason?
mgerrydoyle	699801093149057024	2016-02-17T03:42:36	badnetworker SharlynEgger but look. does nasa take flat earthers' views into account when planning missions? no... and this is same thing
mgerrydoyle	699800976186744835	2016-02-17T03:42:09	SharlynEgger sure we can. don't vaccinate? then your kids don't get to go to public school.
mgerrydoyle	699800795558981632	2016-02-17T03:41:25	badnetworker SharlynEgger how do we keep them in mind? I guess I don't see the upside to that.
mgerrydoyle	699800578449248256	2016-02-17T03:40:34	SharlynEgger if a person clings to irrational and harmful beliefs, they don't get to be part of the conversation, imo
mgerrydoyle	699800397544706048	2016-02-17T03:39:51	SharlynEgger my point is that people have been bothering with this argument for years and gotten nowhere. sorry, I have no patience for it.
mgerrydoyle	699800236609277953	2016-02-17T03:39:12	badnetworker SharlynEgger hmmm. not sure I agree. what is upside of making policy with irrational people in mind? isn't that harmful?
mgerrydoyle	699799899848609792	2016-02-17T03:37:52	SharlynEgger so in a situation where someone has rejected rationality and evidence--tons of it--hard to see point of bothering w/them
mgerrydoyle	699799464618266624	2016-02-17T03:36:08	SharlynEgger I get it, and agree that calling someone stupid to their face is not persuasive, but there's no defending anti-vax.
mgerrydoyle	699798380784939008	2016-02-17T03:31:50	SharlynEgger yeah, I don't buy it. that article lets really dumb and harmful behavior off the hook. you can be scared and still act smart.
mgerrydoyle	699795244708016128	2016-02-17T03:19:22	roanmartigan hard to say. I suspect in a situation like this you'd have to ring a phone in beijing before making a call to fire.
mgerrydoyle	699789602945503232	2016-02-17T02:56:57	this *does* seem like something beijing would try to make happen, but: movie runs in hk are absurdly arbitrary

mgerrydoyle	699787882643361793	2016-02-17T02:50:07	mgerrydoyle but in reality, usable or not, these don't change much. is china going to shoot them at anything in peacetime? no. not a chance
mgerrydoyle	699787641978421248	2016-02-17T02:49:09	mgerrydoyle off the top of my head, I don't know if the hq-9 uses a sealed round but I assume so. that would make it easier to keep usable
mgerrydoyle	699787552794894336	2016-02-17T02:48:48	he's talking about the hq-9 anti-aircraft missiles china has moved to one of its south china sea islands.

mgerrydoyle	699546596812283904	2016-02-16T10:51:20	mgerrydoyle reason for not embracing nfz much simpler: fear of escalation. neither side wants it; consequences very clear.
mgerrydoyle	699546379325018112	2016-02-16T10:50:28	mgerrydoyle that means that with any planning at all, there would be assets standing by to destroy battery within minutes of shooting.

mgerrydoyle	699532452235051008	2016-02-16T09:55:07	AsafRonel of course, the turkish army flies ah-1s, so there are options besides flying f-16s around too.
mgerrydoyle	699530052141101056	2016-02-16T09:45:35	AsafRonel if they do, it's because they're betting russia won't directly attack their ground troops from the air.

mgerrydoyle	697262623088312320	2016-02-10T03:35:38	Christie had just $1 million heading into January; now a shellacking in New Hampshire. He’s done.
mgerrydoyle	697261228851400706	2016-02-10T03:30:06	Let's be real.  -Trump more than doubled Kasich's vote. -Up 16 in SC. -Up 8 nationally before Rubio implodes.  He's going to be the nominee.
mgerrydoyle	697262404984397824	2016-02-10T03:34:46	I want to attend this council meeting. 
mgerrydoyle	697261623912767488	2016-02-10T03:31:40	pbump perhaps he's doing laundry?
mgerrydoyle	697259117816082432	2016-02-10T03:21:42	SharlynEgger ducky_krupnik I hear france is nice. can anyone confirm?
mgerrydoyle	697258143005282304	2016-02-10T03:17:50	SharlynEgger he's not going to be president. you must believe this.
mgerrydoyle	697257925111250945	2016-02-10T03:16:58	everyone: read this thread. (after you read my thread on the same subject) 
mgerrydoyle	697257737269309440	2016-02-10T03:16:13	CherylRofer hey, thanks. it's gratifying when my morning coffee produces something useful.
mgerrydoyle	697257219109195776	2016-02-10T03:14:10	mgerrydoyle --30--
mgerrydoyle	697257129262972928	2016-02-10T03:13:48	mgerrydoyle putin hasn't changed the game. he's just playing a game no one else wants to bother with. (like, say, netball)
mgerrydoyle	697257005996576768	2016-02-10T03:13:19	mgerrydoyle in the end, putin doesn't have the firepower or cash to, with assad, reunite syria or make it a formidable anything.
mgerrydoyle	697256917886849024	2016-02-10T03:12:58	mgerrydoyle but the lack of a clear goal--or even a real desire to be involved--is separate from anything putin has done.
mgerrydoyle	697256839868645376	2016-02-10T03:12:39	mgerrydoyle peer pressure, mostly? "someone has to do something!" writ large. and, yeah, probably some genuine humanitarian concerns too
mgerrydoyle	697256717361414144	2016-02-10T03:12:10	mgerrydoyle as I said, there has never really been a geopolitical reason to get involved in syria. so why is america there?
mgerrydoyle	697256657605128196	2016-02-10T03:11:56	mgerrydoyle is america winning, though? no. clearly not. mostly because we have no idea what we want to do in syria.
mgerrydoyle	697256613942419458	2016-02-10T03:11:45	mgerrydoyle so, yeah, putin really playing 4th-dimensional chess here. what a winner, with his crumbling economy and increasing isolation
mgerrydoyle	697256542769270784	2016-02-10T03:11:28	mgerrydoyle but syria will never be united again under assad. so trade, not so valuable. and assad might be least-valuable ally imaginable.
mgerrydoyle	697256381733154816	2016-02-10T03:10:50	mgerrydoyle best case for russia is being pals with one of the most hated people on earth and getting some trade out of it.
mgerrydoyle	697256321893036033	2016-02-10T03:10:36	mgerrydoyle there's humanitarian argument for being in syria. but geopolitically? yeesh. what a dog. putin is trying hard to marry that dog
mgerrydoyle	697256243002363904	2016-02-10T03:10:17	mgerrydoyle hard to see any way a bunch of groups with little in common besides hating assad would run a country with him gone.
mgerrydoyle	697256175633506304	2016-02-10T03:10:01	mgerrydoyle the data is from experiments you might have heard of, called "Iraq" and "Libya." and we know how they turned out.
mgerrydoyle	697256075117002753	2016-02-10T03:09:37	mgerrydoyle u.s. has some good data on what happens when you get rid of an awful dictator without a popular replacement waiting in wings
mgerrydoyle	697255999166504960	2016-02-10T03:09:19	mgerrydoyle all things being equal, of course, assad is horrible person who shouldn't be running a dairy queen, let alone a country. but...
mgerrydoyle	697255923635527680	2016-02-10T03:09:01	arguments that putin has won strategic victory in syria by keeping assad in power ignore crucial fact: u.s. doesn't really want assad gone
mgerrydoyle	697255870447484928	2016-02-10T03:08:48	syria-related foriegn/military policy tweetstorm inbound. you've been warned.

mgerrydoyle	696966127843315713	2016-02-09T07:57:28	mgerrydoyle ... tracking down hk citizens who were kidnapped and taken into china, basically for making fun of chinese leaders.
mgerrydoyle	696965953674809344	2016-02-09T07:56:47	mgerrydoyle so you can see, I think, why ordinary hkers would be angry that cops chose to crack down on them, instead of say...
mgerrydoyle	696965829905108992	2016-02-09T07:56:17	also, I didn't realize this, but apparently it is tradition to allow unlicensed sellers of snacks to operate during the cny holidays

mgerrydoyle	696963423385448448	2016-02-09T07:46:43	mgerrydoyle to me, bottom line is cops just aren't equipped to handle much beyond patrol duties, while gov't policies stir street anger
mgerrydoyle	696963126420373504	2016-02-09T07:45:32	somehow the hk cops are turning what should be easy p.r. win--quelling violent rioters--into looking vaguely incompetent. that's real skill.

mgerrydoyle	696961824281858049	2016-02-09T07:40:22	I don't see how it's ever acceptable to shoot a gun in the air in one of the most densely populated places on earth. 
mgerrydoyle	696960379750998016	2016-02-09T07:34:38	three guesses as to who is still in charge. 
mgerrydoyle	696957292525162496	2016-02-09T07:22:22	mgerrydoyle ... although of course that means that if this had happened in, say, chicago, someone would have been shot.
mgerrydoyle	696956905067905024	2016-02-09T07:20:49	worth noting again: most departments' rules are that you ONLY fire your weapon if you're trying to hit someone. 
mgerrydoyle	696956742375112704	2016-02-09T07:20:10	... except for the whole gunfire thing. 
mgerrydoyle	696950731027439616	2016-02-09T06:56:17	yeah, this kind of sums up some of the angst I mentioned earlier. 
mgerrydoyle	696946585045962752	2016-02-09T06:39:49	HK elites have spent decades weakening social stabilization tools (e.g. public housing, healthcare, etc.) created by the UK colonial regime.
mgerrydoyle	696946965049954305	2016-02-09T06:41:19	office question on hk film sucked me into scene from 1 of my favorites, "hard boiled." teahouse shootout, of course:

mgerrydoyle	696920046086578177	2016-02-09T04:54:21	mgerrydoyle although of course preference for "rule of law" is always balanced against size of potential profits to be made
mgerrydoyle	696919662018301957	2016-02-09T04:52:50	evidence, perhaps, that just saying "rule of law" over and over is not persuasive to those with skin in the game.

mgerrydoyle	696907848953962497	2016-02-09T04:05:53	mgerrydoyle btw, that cop looks terrified.

mgerrydoyle	687480812984385536	2016-01-14T03:46:13	mgerrydoyle the iranians treated the marines basically how the u.s. would have treated iranian sailors in a similar situation
mgerrydoyle	687480731736526849	2016-01-14T03:45:53	tweeted about this a little last night, but here are the further thoughts you didn't ask for about the iran/navy situation:
mgerrydoyle	687472801591115777	2016-01-14T03:14:23	financial jargon is the worst jargon. yeah, worse than corporate or even--shudder--tech.  I will fight anyone who disagrees.
mgerrydoyle	687472551774167040	2016-01-14T03:13:23	"borrowing is out of control." 
mgerrydoyle	687471986553966593	2016-01-14T03:11:08	CombatCavScout it sucks that in 2016 america there are people who think it's ok to answer the door carrying a rifle. this isn't kabul.
mgerrydoyle	687471780563267584	2016-01-14T03:10:19	CombatCavScout well, I mean, "clean shoot" in the sense that his shot at the dad was probably justified.
mgerrydoyle	687469729942908928	2016-01-14T03:02:10	av8ok and that they shouldn't spontaneously combust, are generally safe, and so on. but your dji camera platform doesn't need an n-number
mgerrydoyle	687469434416463873	2016-01-14T03:01:00	av8ok well, sensible in the sense that, you know, if they're reaper-sized (for example) you need a tail number and a license.
mgerrydoyle	687468609816375296	2016-01-14T02:57:43	$2 billion on Aljazeera America. Do you know how many sports officials you could bribe with that? Qatar could've won the *winter" Olympics.
mgerrydoyle	687468774375620608	2016-01-14T02:58:23	av8ok I agree. I'm in favor of sensible regulation, but this again seems like a solution in search of a problem.
mgerrydoyle	687468453825916929	2016-01-14T02:57:06	av8ok well, easier in the sense that you can "snoop" with a much smaller platform than before. but yeah.
mgerrydoyle	687467888890916864	2016-01-14T02:54:51	yes. the events of the last 18 months have essentially solidified taiwan's desire to be taiwan and not china. 
mgerrydoyle	687467505493778433	2016-01-14T02:53:20	av8ok I mean, I do get that miniaturization of cameras makes it easier to snoop. but mostly this is a solution to a nonexistent problem.
mgerrydoyle	687467096712716288	2016-01-14T02:51:43	av8ok why haven't people been freaking out about r/c aircraft for the last 40 years? the word "drone," mostly.
mgerrydoyle	687464362496282624	2016-01-14T02:40:51	jdcushman luke_j_obrien why would they need to expand their transport fleet? spend that money on mig-29s
mgerrydoyle	687460880733216768	2016-01-14T02:27:01	it used to be that a cable news network was a license to print money. nowadays, though....

mgerrydoyle	687291247837458433	2016-01-13T15:12:57	strikes me that lost Iranian sailors would have been treated same by usn--hands on head, etc. it's a humiliating look though.

mgerrydoyle	687217116915699712	2016-01-13T10:18:23	Steve_Dunthorne yep. or a good start might even be to let the food trucks park in places where everyday hkers might eat at them.
mgerrydoyle	687216962439544832	2016-01-13T10:17:46	it's official: the 10 u.s. sailors have been released by iran.  as others noted, the smoothness of this good sign for state of relationship.

mgerrydoyle	687190994639544320	2016-01-13T08:34:35	This is a good thing. Regardless of what you think of Iran, better to be able to talk in crises than not. 
mgerrydoyle	687186942190956544	2016-01-13T08:18:28	trey_menefee not sure how realistic a plan that is for china. in every element of that scenario, they are outgunned, unless close to shore
mgerrydoyle	687182526222176256	2016-01-13T08:00:56	the fact that u.s. navy, iranian republican guard and iranian navy are all singing from same hymnal bodes well for quick release of sailors.
mgerrydoyle	687172271610445824	2016-01-13T07:20:11	In the traditional Arab calendar 2016 is the year of the International Incident
mgerrydoyle	687181889581391872	2016-01-13T07:58:24	well, there you go--iranian navy and irgc are on the same page. 
mgerrydoyle	687181335689998336	2016-01-13T07:56:12	trey_menefee yeah, I can agree with that. or they don't have the tech to build supercarrier yet and see this as stopgap.
mgerrydoyle	687180635245383680	2016-01-13T07:53:25	trey_menefee but the design limits what it can carry. strike aircraft have limited range/loadouts; can't launch awacs or ew aircraft

mgerrydoyle	687178682662699010	2016-01-13T07:45:39	so, interesting point here maybe: iranian navy is giving the u.s. navy an out (broken gps). illustrates divide with irgc.
mgerrydoyle	687178209763307520	2016-01-13T07:43:47	see, look, the iranian navy is actually writing the excuses for us. 
mgerrydoyle	687177878471983104	2016-01-13T07:42:28	trey_menefee right, but as a weapon it's limited. carrier's primary purpose is to project power... ski jump and smallish size undercut that

mgerrydoyle	687157897407508480	2016-01-13T06:23:04	johnkrempasky blakehounshell fair point. I guess I would even say more broadly that the militaries have been more professional, but yeah.
mgerrydoyle	687157667727425536	2016-01-13T06:22:09	this makes it tricky. but remember, u.s. did make lukewarm "apology" after hainan island incident.  
mgerrydoyle	687156865470365697	2016-01-13T06:18:58	blakehounshell it's definitely weird. but if it were an insertion, those aren't the boats we'd be using. seems more likely a screw-up

mgerrydoyle	687156502986010625	2016-01-13T06:17:31	blakehounshell in previous years I might have agreed. but the navies have been really professional with each other lately.

mgerrydoyle	684639530947772417	2016-01-06T07:35:58	This via mgerrydoyle cuz, you know, he's nicer than this and wanted to remind me 
mgerrydoyle	684634972519403520	2016-01-06T07:17:52	mgerrydoyle tomphillipsin PHammondMP   I bet dollars-to-cat photos that it was not a staged Teller-Ulam thermonuclear device.
mgerrydoyle	684634589944397825	2016-01-06T07:16:20	there are actually lots of reasons to doubt it. no. 1: it's north korea saying something. 
mgerrydoyle	684594943684395009	2016-01-06T04:38:48	Tarpman thought he saw the feds coming and in his excitement I'm afraid he just blue himself.

mgerrydoyle	684606275372498944	2016-01-06T05:23:50	how do you isolate north korea more than it already is? block it on twitter?
mgerrydoyle	684397416200667136	2016-01-05T15:33:54	I would not recommend sending kisses emoji to people with Firefox OS 
mgerrydoyle	684602852950409216	2016-01-06T05:10:14	bonus fact--wheel is also compatible with latest forza motorsport game. 
mgerrydoyle	684602213931577345	2016-01-06T05:07:41	Which is why we staged an armed take over of a federal building and have a guy under a tarp with a gun  
mgerrydoyle	684601710443036672	2016-01-06T05:05:41	she was probably going to deliver emergency snacks to the bundy guys. 
mgerrydoyle	684579962423119872	2016-01-06T03:39:16	Maybe boosted. Definitely not a successful staged device. 
mgerrydoyle	684599660829265921	2016-01-06T04:57:33	mgerrydoyle if that's a fusion weapon, I'm a chinese fighter pilot. (assuming yield estimate is correct, and I don't know if it is.)
mgerrydoyle	684599532869386241	2016-01-06T04:57:02	I've seen yield estimates floating around twitter of 10 kilotons, which, sheesh, is barely a sneeze in nuke terms. half that of "fat man"
mgerrydoyle	684593572784517121	2016-01-06T04:33:21	Americans tend to assume that China has real influence over North Korea. Much less than we think. Chinese exasperated by Kim Jong Un.
mgerrydoyle	684594232611319808	2016-01-06T04:35:58	... like atomic weapons tests, for instance. 
mgerrydoyle	684593675213471745	2016-01-06T04:33:45	little-known fact: geopolitical snark is the best snark.

mgerrydoyle	684592472526209024	2016-01-06T04:28:59	btw, not that this would be a huge issue with dprk air defenses, but today's test is the kind of thing lockmart sells f-35s with.
mgerrydoyle	684590964300644357	2016-01-06T04:22:59	here's our developing story on the dprk's claimed h-bomb test: 
mgerrydoyle	684589505332953088	2016-01-06T04:17:11	in which blakehounshell distills all of today's hot takes into one headline: 
mgerrydoyle	684589357328535556	2016-01-06T04:16:36	mgerrydoyle I don't find that a compelling argument when discussion public health, which is ultimately what type of issue gun violence is.
mgerrydoyle	684589070975012864	2016-01-06T04:15:28	mgerrydoyle ... that the rate is still appallingly high compared with peer nations. "it's terrible but at least it's not getting worse!"
mgerrydoyle	684588882139062273	2016-01-06T04:14:43	it's important to remember when someone cites--correctly--that rate of gun violence in u.s. more or less unchanged in last 20 years...
mgerrydoyle	684584251568877568	2016-01-06T03:56:19	I doubt DPRK exploded a real H-Bomb. More likely a "boosted" weapon with tritium added to increase the yield of a fission bomb.
mgerrydoyle	684583407456616448	2016-01-06T03:52:57	the saddest part of the dprk nuke test is that even the harlem globetrotters couldn't prevent it.
mgerrydoyle	684582778185318401	2016-01-06T03:50:27	If there aren't a thousand "I guess the HOTLINE is BLINGING in Korea" jokes on Twitter by tomorrow I'll be very upset with you all.
mgerrydoyle	684582371174289409	2016-01-06T03:48:50	What the world needs now is a bunch of hot takes from Americans who don't speak Korean and have never been anywhere near North Korea.
mgerrydoyle	684582538178772992	2016-01-06T03:49:30	indeed, so let's all be careful about being too credulous about dprk claims today.... 
mgerrydoyle	684581466840367104	2016-01-06T03:45:15	DPRK's "successful" H-bomb test should have been orders of magnitude stronger than earlier A-bomb tests. But it wasn't. Skepticism in order.
mgerrydoyle	684582110036803585	2016-01-06T03:47:48	if that was really a fusion weapon in the dprk, it was a pretty underwhelming one.
