TheArmoTrader	726237347516289024	2016-04-30T02:30:51	JacobLRosen Why are coaching jobs usually open? Because the situation is not good. For Luke, it wasn't going to get much better than this.

TheArmoTrader	726236477609254912	2016-04-30T02:27:23	This is where Lakers need to flex their muscle. Put all that Kobe $ they made into a monster training and assistant coaching staff.
TheArmoTrader	726235619022663680	2016-04-30T02:23:59	JacobLRosen Unless Kerr was going to step down, the likelihood of a better situation was small.
TheArmoTrader	726234751615397890	2016-04-30T02:20:32	NitPickering Believe the average coach gets 6-7 now. Given that Luke was the hottest name, he's def. getting more.

TheArmoTrader	725771258713907200	2016-04-28T19:38:46	JonathanTjarks samesfandiari So...are we (draft community) underrating Jamal Murray &amp; Denzel Valentine? (Buddy's probably properly rated?)
TheArmoTrader	725765741509660673	2016-04-28T19:16:51	DrewUnga EricPincus Yeah. But the becoming free agents alongside Cousins  (URFA) and George (Player option) still in play.
TheArmoTrader	725765120219971584	2016-04-28T19:14:23	DrewUnga EricPincus Shit, I read that wrong. He'll be a free agent in summer of 2018 AFAIK.
TheArmoTrader	725764777478225921	2016-04-28T19:13:01	DrewUnga Yeah. He can become a free agent along with Cousins and Paul George.
TheArmoTrader	725759910667931648	2016-04-28T18:53:41	Bballaddict91 I don't see Karl being an assistant. No thanks of Wittman. Hornacek is a maybe, Hollins is possible.
TheArmoTrader	725759605574266880	2016-04-28T18:52:28	samesfandiari Bballaddict91 Yep. 
TheArmoTrader	725758871726227460	2016-04-28T18:49:33	Bballaddict91 There will be lots of recently retired NBA players available to staff. Issue is finding experienced guys to help Luke.
TheArmoTrader	725758762821148672	2016-04-28T18:49:07	Bballaddict91 samesfandiari ?Probably stays.
TheArmoTrader	725737981881937920	2016-04-28T17:26:33	samesfandiari brosales12 Good to hear. I'm just worried about the lack of credible former experienced HCs available. Maybe LA poaches 1.
TheArmoTrader	725735489769086976	2016-04-28T17:16:38	brosales12 blssblog forumbluegold Yeah, I was looking for recent former NBA coaches who can sit in as assistant. Nearly every1 taken.
TheArmoTrader	725733931698380800	2016-04-28T17:10:27	forumbluegold Hypothetical at the moment but would Walton need to find his "Gentry" like Kerr did? IE- Would be some1 like Lionel Hollins?

TheArmoTrader	725501246988161024	2016-04-28T01:45:51	brosales12 we kinda need a revamp man. I mean, it's cool and all they win, but DL team needs to work for (and with) LAL.

TheArmoTrader	725497606395170816	2016-04-28T01:31:23	jordanbrianl Should be Luke or Messina. If both decline or LAL comes away unimpressed (doubtful), then Blatt or Hornacek Or Van Gundy.

TheArmoTrader	725163138199461889	2016-04-27T03:22:19	JustRyCole RaiderTruths garykester But he's the head coach. It helps but it's the player dev. guys that help more.
TheArmoTrader	725161329087135745	2016-04-27T03:15:08	JustRyCole RaiderTruths garykester But Luke will need at least two very experienced assistants. Maybe LAL can poach them?

TheArmoTrader	725153568362233857	2016-04-27T02:44:18	garykester RaiderTruths JustRyCole I mean, that's the only way KD is coming to LA. DAR + Butler + Horford is a pretty good core.
TheArmoTrader	725153234080399360	2016-04-27T02:42:58	RaiderTruths JustRyCole garykester Land #1. Trade #1 + Randle + JC to CHI for Butler. Convince KD to come with Horford.   Boom.

TheArmoTrader	725106127529070592	2016-04-26T23:35:47	RaiderTruths JustRyCole garykester I guess getting a 2ndary creater/playmaker isn't bad (but that's why you bet on Clarkson here).

TheArmoTrader	725097462600454144	2016-04-26T23:01:21	lovethoseknicks How so? SoCal is Luke's home. And LAL roster while barren-y, is flexible and has higher potential.
TheArmoTrader	725083026095484928	2016-04-26T22:03:59	JacobRude LakersSBN Scott, Karl, Hollins and Dunleavy turned into Walton, Messina, Ollie and Van Gundy.   Hallelujah.
TheArmoTrader	725067989297561600	2016-04-26T21:04:14	BillSimmons .damanr beat you to it 
TheArmoTrader	725049713146343426	2016-04-26T19:51:37	TheEclectic But anyway, these are good problems to have! Better than arguing over George Karl or Lionel Hollins.
TheArmoTrader	725049646981222403	2016-04-26T19:51:21	TheEclectic Of course, but even Messina is an unknown risk too. Just b/c he's experienced doesn't mean it'll translate.
TheArmoTrader	725049174178320384	2016-04-26T19:49:28	JLoesser Yeah very possible. Looking like a lower high even tho it is poking it's head above TL.
TheArmoTrader	725048594001076224	2016-04-26T19:47:10	TheEclectic brosales12 Like Ben said, that's more than fair. I just value Luke's higher potential + youth + connections to LA.
TheArmoTrader	725048399142248454	2016-04-26T19:46:23	Hadn't realized how bad the deterioration in IWM had gotten. Looking like SPY (running into trendline) but worse. 
TheArmoTrader	725047091337281537	2016-04-26T19:41:11	brosales12 TheEclectic Which is funny b/c Luke technically* has more NBA head coaching experience.  (*Not on record, of course)

TheArmoTrader	725027054115127296	2016-04-26T18:21:34	damanr lol @ that
TheArmoTrader	725024208418385921	2016-04-26T18:10:16	TJFsports Asked if some of it had been reestablished. If they get some credit, some faith has to come back, no?
TheArmoTrader	725023486742286339	2016-04-26T18:07:24	TJFsports Anyway, my original point was that LAL F.O. has taken steps to move forward. Think they deserve (some) credit for that.
TheArmoTrader	725023344190435328	2016-04-26T18:06:50	samesfandiari It's still not a good team, but at least there's talent. Sometimes all you need (but won't be enough).
TheArmoTrader	725023009338056704	2016-04-26T18:05:30	samesfandiari With a good coach? No way. 35. Natural growth + DDR and HW fill some holes. Def still bad but offense should be OK.
TheArmoTrader	725022234818011136	2016-04-26T18:02:25	samesfandiari Probably need another +30 summers to match GS's embarrassment b/w '77-'14! :) CountTheRingz
TheArmoTrader	725021525317935104	2016-04-26T17:59:36	TJFsports Hmm only 2 years guaranteed...which somehow matched Kobe's timeline? And the hire did get us DAR + potential top-3.
TheArmoTrader	725020426175438849	2016-04-26T17:55:14	TJFsports Counters: Byron was clearly a placeholder (stealthy tank move?!), and roster is young+very moldable due to cap space.
TheArmoTrader	725020149489737728	2016-04-26T17:54:08	AnthonyIrwinLA brosales12 This is why the coaching hire is going to be SO important. Mitch/Jim clearly not the guys, needs to be HC.

TheArmoTrader	725019012405596161	2016-04-26T17:49:37	TJFsports Hmph. I mean, they've addressed (Not read as "solved") 3 areas of criticism (assuming they dont hire Marc Jackson), no?
TheArmoTrader	725018420111134722	2016-04-26T17:47:16	TJFsports Hey Tom has your faith in the F.O. been semi-reestablished?  
TheArmoTrader	724999093899022336	2016-04-26T16:30:28	brosales12 I dunno, being personable &amp; a some1 people like (and not just respect) seems important. Not as important as winning but up there

TheArmoTrader	724780356369408000	2016-04-26T02:01:17	brosales12 JustRyCole This is the good thing w/ Luke. He's not gonna get voting power but he'll know that his voice will be strongly held
TheArmoTrader	724768481460154368	2016-04-26T01:14:06	jvposter 100% but I'm great w/ Ettore Messina (Spurs assistant) too. Other solid options but former 2 are A+ hires.
TheArmoTrader	724768228589727744	2016-04-26T01:13:05	jvposter Well, they probably had guys, but they were not publicized or anything. Now clearly they have a whole team. Also: b/c it's 2016!
TheArmoTrader	724765163392368640	2016-04-26T01:00:55	Original_Gio Yeah. Part of that is having young guys, but the other part I think is them taking a more cautious approach to injuries.
TheArmoTrader	724764136551239680	2016-04-26T00:56:50	2 years later, LAL is growing it's analytics dept. + focus, is investing in medical technology, and are considering great names for coach.
TheArmoTrader	724764012026585088	2016-04-26T00:56:20	2 years ago, the Lakers had ~no analytics dept., we're heavily criticized in the health/training realm, &amp; considered bad options for coach.
TheArmoTrader	724763159479783424	2016-04-26T00:52:57	iggypop120 Prob not, but If Jim believes Messina is THE guy, why would he care? Success=great, fails=not his issue anymore.
TheArmoTrader	724762742314270720	2016-04-26T00:51:17	iggypop120 There's still only 30 jobs available. These guys wanna coach. You take that risk esp. since you'll be &gt;$10M richer.
TheArmoTrader	724760289296576513	2016-04-26T00:41:33	JacobRude But I mean even at regular coach $, why is Messina saying no? SA job can be +5 years away
TheArmoTrader	724759976338563072	2016-04-26T00:40:18	JacobRude If he fails, not Jim's issue anymore. If he succeeds, then the $ doesn't matter.
TheArmoTrader	724759741398806528	2016-04-26T00:39:22	JacobRude B/c if Jim feels like Ettore is gonna be the 1 to save his job, $ isn't an issue to him.
TheArmoTrader	724759399198121984	2016-04-26T00:38:00	JacobRude why? If LA offers him 10M/year, he's gonna turn that down?
TheArmoTrader	724759168029073413	2016-04-26T00:37:05	BOOOOM. 
TheArmoTrader	724740719538130944	2016-04-25T23:23:47	jzmazlish slow-footedness is an issue but he's so large for a PG that I think that can help compensate for some of that
TheArmoTrader	724740073682391040	2016-04-25T23:21:13	jzmazlish Yeah, dribble drive could work (somewhere Mudiay outshines DAR...even tho DAR finishes WAY better in paint)
TheArmoTrader	724737934964871168	2016-04-25T23:12:43	jzmazlish And regarding scoring in the arc: His post-up s IIRC were elite,&amp; not just for a PG. Will go down w/ vol but shld still b good
TheArmoTrader	724737605233860608	2016-04-25T23:11:24	jzmazlish And as the year went on his FTr climbed.  (Finished higher than Curry's rookie year!)
TheArmoTrader	724737355043627008	2016-04-25T23:10:25	jzmazlish I think he reads passing lanes pretty well. On-ball defense needs work but he wasnt the Lakers worst perimeter defender (I know)!
TheArmoTrader	724737123656421378	2016-04-25T23:09:29	jzmazlish I think he had a good year shooting % wise w/ 48% eFG% (esp. considering age).
TheArmoTrader	724733650999214080	2016-04-25T22:55:41	jzmazlish Hmm. I'm going to read the rest later today but I disagree with wut u wrote on DAR! LakerHater (Kidding,but I do disagree still)
TheArmoTrader	724730783378735104	2016-04-25T22:44:18	JustRyCole Can we start a Fire Worthy campaign now? We need to get non-UCLA showtime Lakers tf outta here.
TheArmoTrader	724720437528154113	2016-04-25T22:03:11	samesfandiari So, what's the DRtg when Steph is sitting and Dray is playing? (Also, is that a decent sample size?)
TheArmoTrader	724719785724899328	2016-04-25T22:00:36	samesfandiari is the decrease mostly on the offensive end? What happens to DRTG?
TheArmoTrader	724719670209597441	2016-04-25T22:00:08	samesfandiari yeah that's not gonna cut it!
TheArmoTrader	724719246811389953	2016-04-25T21:58:27	samesfandiari too lazy to lookup, what's GS Net Rtg w/ no Curry on the floor?
TheArmoTrader	724718488888074240	2016-04-25T21:55:27	JustRyCole what he say
TheArmoTrader	724715595460005888	2016-04-25T21:43:57	JustRyCole That's good. I want the coach to weigh in on FA signings (since it'll likely be a good coach). Wonder if Luke can sway culture
TheArmoTrader	724709114098511872	2016-04-25T21:18:11	DexterC73 AnthonyIrwinLA Well, neither have been a negative to the Lakers, so there's that.
TheArmoTrader	724677191515041792	2016-04-25T19:11:20	sspencer_smb Yep a little. But GS is a good team w/o Curry too! Just not unbeatable. So LAC can surely beat them.
TheArmoTrader	724675532156080128	2016-04-25T19:04:45	sspencer_smb HCPG honestly think if GS turns up D, and Klay steps up a little, they're evenly matched.

TheArmoTrader	724610948497952770	2016-04-25T14:48:07	samesfandiari It doesn't really matter if they land Luke (who's a better choice risk/reward wise) or Messina (slightly worse).
TheArmoTrader	724605035187822592	2016-04-25T14:24:37	samesfandiari Nah. Thibz wasn't coming.

TheArmoTrader	724467759623475201	2016-04-25T05:19:08	shahanLA Rosters were never good, but there's more nuance in judging if a coach is good. 17Ws is WAY different from 28 even tho both "fail"

TheArmoTrader	724447310529187840	2016-04-25T03:57:53	brosales12 LifeOfABruin Yeah. Messina is gonna give Luke a run for his $. Luke did say he wanted to coach.
TheArmoTrader	724446528748703749	2016-04-25T03:54:46	LifeOfABruin He's NEARLY the perfect candidate. 
TheArmoTrader	724445609218842624	2016-04-25T03:51:07	LifeOfABruin Yeah, but maybe they go Messina since they MIGHT be worried about Luke's youth.
TheArmoTrader	724445366012104704	2016-04-25T03:50:09	LifeOfABruin Yeah, but at least there's a solid chance he can be a decent coach. There's upside there.
TheArmoTrader	724445196671315969	2016-04-25T03:49:29	brosales12 Yep,but @ least there's something to marinade there. He's young,FAs might be attracted, and hey, Uconn connections dont hurt.
TheArmoTrader	724444652632313860	2016-04-25T03:47:19	Luke is a home-run hire. Messina a triple-hit.  JVG and Ollie, I have issues with, but both have their upsides.

TheArmoTrader	724415188263301120	2016-04-25T01:50:14	tpcourier kevinlappin This would be the quantitative approach. Wouldn't take the counterfactuals into consideration.
TheArmoTrader	724413942685016064	2016-04-25T01:45:17	kevinlappin tpcourier Well, that wouldn't be the way to value them. You'd take what they do on average.
TheArmoTrader	724413313023504384	2016-04-25T01:42:47	kevinlappin tpcourier You for sure would if you had shot creators! But if your team lacks them, KCP's value drops a lot.
TheArmoTrader	724412611547160577	2016-04-25T01:40:00	kevinlappin tpcourier NBAcouchside Like, take Caldwell-Pope &amp; Clarkson. Lots of Clarksons in NBA. KCPs?Less. But NBA cant survive on KCPS
TheArmoTrader	724412248785977344	2016-04-25T01:38:33	kevinlappin tpcourier NBAcouchside Well, in the aggregate sense, no, because teams always need latter guys, but in individual sense,yeah.
TheArmoTrader	724411891020230656	2016-04-25T01:37:08	DrewUnga Thad_Sing FA is always overrated. Only 7 of the top 31 FAs as ranked by teamziller switched teams last summer. 2 went to Lakers.
TheArmoTrader	724410777617108992	2016-04-25T01:32:42	kevinlappin tpcourier NBAcouchside I'd say its 60/40 in terms of value. Why we see more guys who cant defend than guys who cant score.
TheArmoTrader	724410660386283521	2016-04-25T01:32:14	tpcourier kevinlappin NBAcouchside Yeah, that's fair. Good offense always trumps good defense.
TheArmoTrader	724410218235367425	2016-04-25T01:30:29	tpcourier kevinlappin NBAcouchside That, and the objective of the game is to score the ball. Doesn't mean D isn't valuable.

TheArmoTrader	723933119254913025	2016-04-23T17:54:40	AnthonyIrwinLA Only if they ran out of Pastrami! So let's really hope they don't.  (As in, Luke is really interested in LA- I think he is)
TheArmoTrader	723932688646701056	2016-04-23T17:52:57	trchavez41684 AnthonyIrwinLA And plus, 100% of new assistant hires are unproven. You at least have stuff to fallback on with Luke.
TheArmoTrader	723932454671683584	2016-04-23T17:52:01	trchavez41684 AnthonyIrwinLA I'm not ascribing that whole success to Luke, but you don't do what they did with a statue placeholder.

TheArmoTrader	723932062718152704	2016-04-23T17:50:28	AnthonyIrwinLA If u go to a sandwich shop wanting a pastrami no matter what...doesn't matter if turkey or ham or chicken is available.
TheArmoTrader	723931556826341376	2016-04-23T17:48:27	trchavez41684 AnthonyIrwinLA Phil Jackson was also unproven when 1st hired. Pat Riley too.  And I'd say he's semi-proven (GS coach stint)
TheArmoTrader	723931325040758784	2016-04-23T17:47:32	AnthonyIrwinLA So it's like they know what Luke can bring. And if that's who they want as their #1 then others don't matter.
TheArmoTrader	723930764820111360	2016-04-23T17:45:18	AnthonyIrwinLA trchavez41684 Can't disagree on the former. It's just that...they have a lot to work with WRT Luke vs say a Atkinson.
TheArmoTrader	723930126455435265	2016-04-23T17:42:46	AnthonyIrwinLA trchavez41684 Hmm. I disagree. There's no secret about Luke's potential and what he can offer. Especially for LA Lakers.
TheArmoTrader	723928749402529792	2016-04-23T17:37:18	AnthonyIrwinLA trchavez41684 Luke is the best candidate tho, even if he doesn't pan out.

TheArmoTrader	723212392117587968	2016-04-21T18:10:45	HPbasketball I guess its possible but seems pretty unlikely that KD wont hve his decision by July 10,12:01 AM (where JC's waiting prd ends)
TheArmoTrader	723209814034116609	2016-04-21T18:00:30	HPbasketball So like, even if LAL was waiting for a KD+Horford decision (or whatever), they can match w/o really affecting that (2/2)

TheArmoTrader	723206208509743105	2016-04-21T17:46:11	brosales12 It'll depend on how UFA plays out for LAL (If they nail a bunch of guys, then Arenas Offer will be only way JC gets $$)

TheArmoTrader	721035124943376386	2016-04-15T17:59:04	CTKwasniewski Curious as to your view on the LAL medical/training staff after a very healthy season (esp. w/ Kobe)

TheArmoTrader	720884025615732736	2016-04-15T07:58:39	hamidrahimm JustRyCole Thats a good one. Like Koufas too.
TheArmoTrader	720883791032549378	2016-04-15T07:57:43	damanr JustRyCole True story:  Using the SBNation 2015 FA rankings, only 8 of the top 31 FAs switched jerseys.  LAL nabbed 25%(2) of those
TheArmoTrader	720883146489606144	2016-04-15T07:55:10	Bballaddict91 JustRyCole Yeah some interesting RFA guys but those are low odds plays and thus low odds of happening
TheArmoTrader	720880238704459777	2016-04-15T07:43:36	Bballaddict91 JustRyCole Dont believe so. They have Horford to deal with &amp; maybe they think Hardaway can be that guy. Trade mkt also there
TheArmoTrader	720879790480207872	2016-04-15T07:41:50	JustRyCole Funny thing is people will look at that list and be mortified (aside from HW). But FA is overrated and this class sucksssss.
TheArmoTrader	720878768072450048	2016-04-15T07:37:46	JustRyCole Just sign a damn quality center (Hassan/Mahinmi/Biyombo/Plumlee), a decent wing (Baze/Lee/Dudley) and retain JC. All I want.
TheArmoTrader	720877745878663168	2016-04-15T07:33:42	JustRyCole ...because you can't sign anything until July 7 12:01 EST.  JC signs offer sheet that minute, LAL has until 10th,12:01 to decide
TheArmoTrader	720877446258536448	2016-04-15T07:32:31	JustRyCole Yeah that's not happening. Like say the Nets agree with JC on an offer sheet July 3. LA will have July 4-10 to think abt it.
TheArmoTrader	720877136895021056	2016-04-15T07:31:17	JustRyCole He can't tho. He literally can't sign until July 7. A team would be really dumb to agree to terms w/ him before then.
TheArmoTrader	720876896242655232	2016-04-15T07:30:19	JustRyCole It will matter how July 1-6 plays out. Both for FA market and Lakers. No non-LAL team is agreeing w/ him until July 7.
TheArmoTrader	720876558026612736	2016-04-15T07:28:59	JustRyCole That is a very possible scenario. But RFA is weird bro. Yeah teams have little to lose,but if it's such a low odds play,y do it?
TheArmoTrader	720876301062508544	2016-04-15T07:27:58	JustRyCole Maybe not, but like I said, agent/agency relationships matter, carrots matter (hits URFA earlier w/ PO), situation matters
TheArmoTrader	720875991791325185	2016-04-15T07:26:44	JustRyCole The 58M thing. But for them, JC's contract would be even throughout all 4 years. For LAL, MLE years 1-2, balloons year 3-4.
TheArmoTrader	720875661519237124	2016-04-15T07:25:25	JustRyCole So ideal would him agreeing to the EBR deal asap (maybe he does to lock in the $, and maybe LAL gives P.O in year 4 as carrot)
TheArmoTrader	720875378827337729	2016-04-15T07:24:18	JustRyCole Really wanna avoid Arenas offer sheet. Ideal for year 1-2 but balloons year 3/4 ('18/19) where I think we can b major FA players
TheArmoTrader	720874962874052608	2016-04-15T07:22:39	JustRyCole So LA can sign him via cap space (to any size up to 25% max), match offer (4 year/58M), or sign via EBR (4 year/$26M).
TheArmoTrader	720874589690011648	2016-04-15T07:21:10	JustRyCole LAL can offer him up to 25% max. But that's using cap space, which would be a v bad idea w/ JC b/c not maximizing cap hold.
TheArmoTrader	720874391328792576	2016-04-15T07:20:22	JustRyCole This is where agent/team relationship comes into play IMO. Maybe LAL promises him 3rd year player option w/ EBR deal.
TheArmoTrader	720873993213849600	2016-04-15T07:18:47	JustRyCole +he's probably out offer-hunting so he can sign a bigger deal than what LAL can offer w/ early bird rights ($26M/4 years)
TheArmoTrader	720873526698246145	2016-04-15T07:16:56	JustRyCole ...If all the top tier guys have signed &amp; LAL has missed, LA will prob use cap space at that point to sign him. If LAL hits+
TheArmoTrader	720873216315498497	2016-04-15T07:15:42	JustRyCole Now,when he really hits FA, I'm sure he prefers to sign into cap space w/ LA, but depending on LAs position,LA might not do that
TheArmoTrader	720872787389259776	2016-04-15T07:14:00	JustRyCole Well, he's gotta wait the 7 days, he'll get little interest in that time b/c he's restricted.
TheArmoTrader	720871846573248512	2016-04-15T07:10:16	JustRyCole Zero.  95% of 2nd round picks don't see the money he's gonna see this summer this early on in their careers.

TheArmoTrader	720027143598551040	2016-04-12T23:13:43	brosales12 JustRyCole Jokic on the flipside, has the opposite issue of Okafor. Old heads will ignore b/c no metrics+ Denver.
TheArmoTrader	720026911158591488	2016-04-12T23:12:47	JustRyCole brosales12 So I'm expecting some of the old head votes to be negated by new heads.  As for Booker, I don't get as a lock.

TheArmoTrader	720026181345488896	2016-04-12T23:09:53	brosales12 JustRyCole Okafor and Jokic shouldn't be assumed. Def/issues for former, lack of big mins latter. Mudiay also gonna get votes.

TheArmoTrader	719699248854401024	2016-04-12T01:30:46	ryangsoares In fact, he'll be able to play more 3 in his first 2 years than 5. Obviously matchup dependent.
TheArmoTrader	719699104704561152	2016-04-12T01:30:12	ryangsoares He probably cant outside of some small ball matchups. But he should be able to after/during year 3. He's sooo young.

TheArmoTrader	719289594663936001	2016-04-10T22:22:57	forumbluegold Ideal FA coup would be Courtney Lee &amp; Bazemore, but I'd be content with something like P.J. Hairston &amp; Dudley even.
TheArmoTrader	719288785112969216	2016-04-10T22:19:44	DramaMC Tough to answer but he is surprisingly light on his feet. Probably slows down a bit but there's more value in him playing the 5.
TheArmoTrader	719285825008107520	2016-04-10T22:07:59	DramaMC ...and by the time he gains weight/strength, that issue will be minimized. Bender can play some 3 against SOME guys, so that helps

TheArmoTrader	719284454842195968	2016-04-10T22:02:32	brosales12 DramaMC You won't play Bender at center unless in small ball matchups. He should be able to get there more full time &gt;year 3.

TheArmoTrader	718629260789817344	2016-04-09T02:39:01	brosales12 Oh crap, that's right. Thought he went UDFA.  RE: Qualls. They waived him from DL team even, might be free.
TheArmoTrader	718627969988558849	2016-04-09T02:33:54	brosales12 Random but remember Michael Qualls? Hope we can get him on SL team. Him and/or Hanlan. Liked those 2 guys.

TheArmoTrader	718623119909388288	2016-04-09T02:14:37	jhun88 brosales12 I liked Richardson, but only as a late 2nd round pick or UDFA. 34 wouldve been a high risk w/ him
TheArmoTrader	718622933707436032	2016-04-09T02:13:53	LifeOfABruin Again. That doesn't matter. Mins is a situation based thing. Not like NP played 25MPG. He played 60 mins less, big deal.
TheArmoTrader	718622392231137280	2016-04-09T02:11:44	LifeOfABruin HerbieVerstinks that really doesn't matter since they played diff positions. No backup to Bryce. BA played 100 less in 13/14

TheArmoTrader	718620914183614464	2016-04-09T02:05:51	JustRyCole Why? How? He's not gonna get an offer. Makes no sense to pull QO like they did w/ Bazemore given massive caproom.
TheArmoTrader	718620674009370626	2016-04-09T02:04:54	brosales12 I'm hoping more that Looney &gt; Nance doesn't haunt us. I'm really high on Kevon, even tho Nance pick proved to be adequate.
TheArmoTrader	718620221548793857	2016-04-09T02:03:06	brosales12 That was the right position at the time. I had Brown higher even tho I was high on Norm as well.
TheArmoTrader	718619988433641472	2016-04-09T02:02:11	JustRyCole He's gonna get QO, not get an offer in RFA, then take the QO. Will be a RFA again in '17 if no deal from LAL (hope we lock him)

TheArmoTrader	718607406096211968	2016-04-09T01:12:11	samesfandiari I think Jabari is the better prospect, but Randle matches or bests most stats except scoring + efficiency.

TheArmoTrader	718214508880093184	2016-04-07T23:10:57	Bballaddict91 Hence why I think a superstar trade would have to come from the East. Deosn't leave many options: Butler....Love maybe?

TheArmoTrader	718155243452702720	2016-04-07T19:15:27	JacobLRosen Yeah, it's super annoying when I do comparison searches. Gotta either include 2nd year guys or mentally list Randle there.

TheArmoTrader	718148810942251008	2016-04-07T18:49:53	samesfandiari RichardYannow presidual Yeah, over the last 3 years, outside of KAT, I dont think any rookie was changing PHI W/L by much.
TheArmoTrader	718147884391137280	2016-04-07T18:46:12	Nice.  
TheArmoTrader	718147808805519360	2016-04-07T18:45:54	RichardYannow But overall, it's not going to derail your plan of being bad and having top-5 picks.
TheArmoTrader	718147793873817600	2016-04-07T18:45:51	RichardYannow It looks better short term because you have physical proof of your plan vs "Look at all these picks we have!". (1/2)

TheArmoTrader	718144840219820032	2016-04-07T18:34:07	RichardYannow presidual Why cant LaVine fit under that bill? PHI isn't going to compete (at least planned by Hinkie) until &gt;2020.
TheArmoTrader	718143963048206337	2016-04-07T18:30:37	presidual Yep, good point. Shouldn't have taken Saric knowing Embiid was at least 2 years away from contributing. Imagine LaVine on PHI.

TheArmoTrader	717078246802653184	2016-04-04T19:55:51	brosales12 Seems more like a dual-option rather than glorified TO.  But yeah, from what I've read, it's rare. But who knows.
TheArmoTrader	717076928239247360	2016-04-04T19:50:36	brosales12 CTKwasniewski From what I understand, basically, player option is only in power if player is on team. Again,a negotiated thing.

TheArmoTrader	714306150460600321	2016-03-28T04:20:32	CTKwasniewski slayinmaven That thought crosses my mind every now and then. But they cant. PR-wise (2 worst LAL seasons) + deadline issue.
TheArmoTrader	714305635387453440	2016-03-28T04:18:29	mattbilinsky theejamieson Tank's over guys. If we fall out of the 2 spot (pre-lottery of course), I'll delete my account.
TheArmoTrader	714305216535855104	2016-03-28T04:16:49	CTKwasniewski slayinmaven I agree, I'm just saying that the list of actual, attainable FAs is much smaller than it appears.
TheArmoTrader	714304435489378304	2016-03-28T04:13:43	CTKwasniewski slayinmaven And again, looking at the FA list, there are some interesting/worthy guys, but it's such an overrated "tool".
TheArmoTrader	714304200356667393	2016-03-28T04:12:47	slayinmaven CTKwasniewski Yeah, those are issues for sure. But basketball-construction wise, think flak they receive is too much
TheArmoTrader	714303422728503301	2016-03-28T04:09:41	CTKwasniewski slayinmaven I guess Davis,but again,just play Black &amp; u get 75% of what Davis provides. R. Lopez only other 1 I can think of
TheArmoTrader	714303335206027264	2016-03-28T04:09:20	CTKwasniewski slayinmaven Bballaddict91 Eh, FA is pretty damn overrated. Who did they miss on last summer that now looks bad?
TheArmoTrader	714302718785888256	2016-03-28T04:06:53	LifeOfABruin Like I said, lets wait for fall, b/c stuff can change. Let's see how draft/transfers/etc shake out.
TheArmoTrader	714302447972327424	2016-03-28T04:05:49	LifeOfABruin I think in-season performance probably should weigh more than tourney result (see your boy Tony Bennett for ex.), like 75/25.
TheArmoTrader	714300969689821184	2016-03-28T03:59:56	LifeOfABruin So, I know you think the roster is pretty flawed...but your expectation is a F4? How does that work?
TheArmoTrader	714300001996787712	2016-03-28T03:56:06	LifeOfABruin Before the season we should set an expectation meter. Then visit it after the season.

TheArmoTrader	714298517217366016	2016-03-28T03:50:12	LifeOfABruin Oh I am. I didn't want him fired last summer even tho I knew this was coming. Even for Lakers, that's a bad look.
TheArmoTrader	714298211003801600	2016-03-28T03:48:59	LifeOfABruin Lol, well. Bad coach,leader. Old-school Xs/Os. Consistent underperformance relative to team's talent level. He's an ass, ETc

TheArmoTrader	713484369135083520	2016-03-25T21:55:04	colezwicker jzmazlish That's cool. And generally as a basketball player he was really good as well.
TheArmoTrader	713482317004742656	2016-03-25T21:46:54	colezwicker jzmazlish Yeah agree there as well. Ingram potential on D also higher IMO.
TheArmoTrader	713473491656249344	2016-03-25T21:11:50	hmfaigen el_jonesy35 Better or worse than the Suns - Lakers game?
TheArmoTrader	713470831590944769	2016-03-25T21:01:16	FlyByKnite Well given he can't use one of his hands right now, I wouldn't call him top 5 in the Clippers too. Maybe.
TheArmoTrader	713464558820524033	2016-03-25T20:36:21	colezwicker jzmazlish What do you guys think of the Ingram/Rashard Lewis comp. I kinda like it. Tho I think BI will be a little better.
TheArmoTrader	713404046996996096	2016-03-25T16:35:53	samesfandiari Giannis easy Yes.  Wiggins barely no. Parker no.   Value (Wiggins - 2 years of rookie contract) = Value (Ingram).

TheArmoTrader	713269160172658688	2016-03-25T07:39:54	KajSkyhook33 Yeah, I'd be hesitant to pick him to if he decided to stay 1 more year. Probably would go Jaylen Brown at 3 then.
TheArmoTrader	713268141514563585	2016-03-25T07:35:51	KajSkyhook33 That's up in the air, but it's rumoured that he has an NBA out, just needs a (hefty) buyout.
TheArmoTrader	713267685593747456	2016-03-25T07:34:02	KajSkyhook33 I hate that but I get it. Wise move would be to stay for 1 more year. But entering this draft makes only 100% sense.
TheArmoTrader	713266820703080449	2016-03-25T07:30:36	KajSkyhook33 But you're right. He is a project. I wouldn't expect him to be a normal contributor until his 3rd year. He's so young.
TheArmoTrader	713266641547603968	2016-03-25T07:29:53	KajSkyhook33 Yep. What I take away from watching him is that he needs strength+experience &amp; a lot of his weaknesses will be mitigated
TheArmoTrader	713264921866153984	2016-03-25T07:23:03	KajSkyhook33 what are your doubts?
TheArmoTrader	713262130506502146	2016-03-25T07:11:58	naufalsanaullah so like a move to 1.22 ish then a rollover to like ~1.00?

TheArmoTrader	713256286570151936	2016-03-25T06:48:45	RyanKelapire JustRyCole Well not a project, but not as impactful in his freshman year. He wasn't on 2016 boards IIRC
TheArmoTrader	713255886412644354	2016-03-25T06:47:09	JustRyCole Jeter was supposed to be the ready one and Rabb was supposed to be the project. Projecting is hard.

TheArmoTrader	713230028763365376	2016-03-25T05:04:24	ballers247 He's super young, he'll improve. NBA doesn't press as often too/court is more open.  AST% solid for a SF.
TheArmoTrader	713227366605008896	2016-03-25T04:53:49	ballers247 Also, I do think Ingram has some point-forwardness to him. Nothing crazy like Giannis, but def. something in there, like PG13.

TheArmoTrader	712863399017885696	2016-03-24T04:47:33	HerbieVerstinks That'd suck, but they'd take Simmons which is great cuz I rly am not crazy over BS. This is assuming we land 2 or 3.
TheArmoTrader	712862516267847680	2016-03-24T04:44:02	brosales12 JacobRude I have a feeling Jackson's gonna have a Shabazz/Jaylen Brown/Stan Johnson-esque disappointing season FWIW.
TheArmoTrader	712861485568012288	2016-03-24T04:39:57	JacobRude brosales12 Jacob, think of it like this. We lose the pick, we're taking Lonzo Ball (or OG Anunoby) next year. Decent tradeoff
TheArmoTrader	712861212095168513	2016-03-24T04:38:51	HerbieVerstinks Gamblers fallacy. 50/50 is 50/50 (well, it's 57/43 here, so even better), doesn't matter what the historical results are.
TheArmoTrader	712860950395764736	2016-03-24T04:37:49	adamcarstens I hope you've seen this 
TheArmoTrader	712857435778781186	2016-03-24T04:23:51	So yeah, with that loss, Lakers are 15-56. Phoenix has 20 wins. Nets have 19. I'd be shocked if LAL fell out of #2 now. GoLakers

TheArmoTrader	712832301407670272	2016-03-24T02:43:59	HerbieVerstinks SmoothsHoops I dunno man. He's pretty good. Doing what Klay did as a rookie but 2 years younger.  
TheArmoTrader	712831255612510209	2016-03-24T02:39:49	HerbieVerstinks Bobby Jax is actually closer to Clarkson.   JustRyCole
TheArmoTrader	712830686604894208	2016-03-24T02:37:34	HerbieVerstinks Lol, I cant tell if this is a troll or not. He's pretty close to Klay.
TheArmoTrader	712827714323918848	2016-03-24T02:25:45	brosales12 It's almost like he injured his knee yesterday or something.
TheArmoTrader	712826626061377537	2016-03-24T02:21:25	ericjackson It's fine tho. We lose the pick,we're getting a lotto pick in a stronger draft in '17. Essentially '16 1-3 should equal '17 4-7
TheArmoTrader	712825999327518720	2016-03-24T02:18:56	ericjackson Yep, pretty much a coin flip. Hey, I'll take it. Thought it'd be at 25-30% going into the season.
TheArmoTrader	712825489769902080	2016-03-24T02:16:55	brosales12 samesfandiari Fun fact: Marquis Teague is younger (by a few months) than Gary Payton II.
TheArmoTrader	712824834946797568	2016-03-24T02:14:18	Tonight's probably the last time I actively root for the tank for the Lakers. A loss tonight pretty much solidifies LAL @ #2 for the lottery

TheArmoTrader	712823748877897728	2016-03-24T02:10:00	brosales12 This is good for #32. More 1st round bubble prospects mean the better chance the prospects we discussed fall to us.

TheArmoTrader	712732614218493953	2016-03-23T20:07:51	samesfandiari brosales12 See, I worry a lot of his benefit comes from non-half court opportunities. IE- wont work in playoffs.

TheArmoTrader	712516637753270272	2016-03-23T05:49:39	colezwicker Pretty much Draymond Green,just maybe not as strong. Here was my fav play from the 2games I saw  2:04:10

TheArmoTrader	712515214785310720	2016-03-23T05:43:59	colezwicker Man, he's just smart. Does stuff that makes a team better. Dont see him as a star persay, but a better def. version of Gallo?
TheArmoTrader	712514456014688257	2016-03-23T05:40:58	DrewUnga Shooting ~51% on the season in the paint, while Porzingis is at 48.5% despite having only ~half the in-paint attempts of Randle.
TheArmoTrader	712510026263498752	2016-03-23T05:23:22	colezwicker Watched a bunch more Bender today. Liking him even more. Think I'm close to moving him #2 after Ingram and above Simmons.

TheArmoTrader	712498441654546437	2016-03-23T04:37:20	iggypop120 I always thought he was average but lately he's been bad. Ask FlyByKnite what he thinks
TheArmoTrader	712497454856462337	2016-03-23T04:33:25	iggypop120 Doc is a bad coach. Clifford was weird, just a bad fit + dealt with injuries all year.
TheArmoTrader	712497303228178432	2016-03-23T04:32:49	daothermike Doc is a bad coach. He was OK when he played there FWIW. Just not shining like he is in MEM.

TheArmoTrader	712480004823617536	2016-03-23T03:24:05	kimkarlocastro brosales12 Gonna take the ~max but if LAL strikes out, yeah, that's a worthy gamble.

TheArmoTrader	712146613414678528	2016-03-22T05:19:18	Yep, this was great. Gives you insight on how someone can support either (esp. Trump) guy. 
TheArmoTrader	712146467188637696	2016-03-22T05:18:43	colezwicker Ohhoo, tough guy, eh? Next thing you're gonna say is a 6'7 guy can play center and a PG can launch 35 footers w/ no issue huh?
TheArmoTrader	712145582572183553	2016-03-22T05:15:12	colezwicker whereas Hield is gonna be asked to guard (or be matched up with) the Clarksons, Oladipos, even McCollums. Easier task I think.
TheArmoTrader	712145328766455808	2016-03-22T05:14:12	colezwicker No, he could. It's just with him, he's gonna be asked to guard tougher players. Gonna be asked to gaurd PG13s, Kawhis, etc
TheArmoTrader	712143899490275328	2016-03-22T05:08:31	colezwicker Yep. Think Buddy can become decent defensively once he's put into the "Redick Role". He has such a heavy onus offensively at OU
TheArmoTrader	712143005826703360	2016-03-22T05:04:58	colezwicker You'd think so (&amp; I bet you Pelton's model doesn't like Hield due to "regressioning") but he's done it w/ increasing vol./focus
TheArmoTrader	712142266995908613	2016-03-22T05:02:02	colezwicker It's real close for me. Love both guys. Theoretically I should have DV &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BH but mentally I cant pull that trigger.
TheArmoTrader	712141717042909184	2016-03-22T04:59:50	colezwicker  This season does seem '14/15 Korver-esque tho. Like, he's so far from his mean. He's still an all-timer tho.
TheArmoTrader	712140383002566658	2016-03-22T04:54:32	colezwicker he's a sick worker as we know so getting a "Redick" is huge for a team. Think NO, SAC (RIP), TOR, MIL will be interested in BH
TheArmoTrader	712139814951202816	2016-03-22T04:52:17	colezwicker I agree he doesnt have Curry/Allen ceiling...but he's probably somewhere between Meeks &amp; Redick for now.

TheArmoTrader	712138940652716032	2016-03-22T04:48:49	colezwicker That is true about his shooting. TS% &amp; eFG% would be 5th. 2nd in 3P% only behind Slow-mo (LOL...yeah yeah volume I know).

TheArmoTrader	710728643866075137	2016-03-18T07:24:48	colezwicker Think we're gonna see some funky draft entries this year due to new rules + weak draft. A. Holiday might. So hard to grade them
TheArmoTrader	710727424888086528	2016-03-18T07:19:57	colezwicker Yeah, same. Thought I'd have to worry about him next year, hence the lack on interest. Certainly can see him entering now

TheArmoTrader	710724658018910209	2016-03-18T07:08:57	colezwicker Yeah, Ron's a guy I'd love to have as the 5th guard on the team.  So say DAR/starting SG/Clarkson/Lou/Ron.
TheArmoTrader	710722638008549376	2016-03-18T07:00:56	colezwicker Yeah, assuming LAL doesn't draft a SG at 2/3 or 32, I'm really hoping Baker ends up on LAL as an UDFA.

TheArmoTrader	710651281287688192	2016-03-18T02:17:23	LakerGMC brosales12 Yeah, but hey, if you're "dumping" Batum for Westbrook, you do it, lol
TheArmoTrader	710649534494277633	2016-03-18T02:10:26	RyanKelapire JacobRude They ARE?
TheArmoTrader	710649157988397057	2016-03-18T02:08:57	JacobRude I mean, WSU is gonna "upset" Arizona so I'd be sweaty too
TheArmoTrader	710649010487320576	2016-03-18T02:08:21	LakerGMC brosales12 I'm just saying it's gonna be super easy to move guys in '17 summer. 2nd cap jump+teams who miss out on this summer.
TheArmoTrader	710648723789848576	2016-03-18T02:07:13	brosales12 LakerGMC IIRC, you can get there if you dump Lou, stretch/dump Young, and Bass opts out (and trade/lose pick I guess).
TheArmoTrader	710647891845521408	2016-03-18T02:03:55	LakerGMC brosales12  +teams the space to absorb Parson's contract (which will be around 27M). 2nd cap jump gives a lot of leeway.
TheArmoTrader	710647830340177926	2016-03-18T02:03:40	LakerGMC brosales12 Don't even think you'll even need the stretch option. Cap goes from 90 to 108. That by itself will give a lot of+
TheArmoTrader	710646747123490816	2016-03-18T01:59:22	LakerGMC Again, there's gonna be so much cap room, someone will happily take on those quality guys for @ worst free barring disaster injury
TheArmoTrader	710646418411618306	2016-03-18T01:58:03	LakerGMC So a guy like Batum will just cost like 20% more the following summer (BTW, looking at 2017 wings &amp; YIKES, best name=Redick,Iggy)
TheArmoTrader	710645790742437888	2016-03-18T01:55:34	LakerGMC Of course they could, but we're right back at that dumbass deadline thing again. BTW, don't forget 2nd cap jump in '17 too
TheArmoTrader	710645184665505793	2016-03-18T01:53:09	LakerGMC I wouldn't mind that team at all. Especially since dumping guys will be so easy. More assets for LAL.
TheArmoTrader	710644611346083840	2016-03-18T01:50:53	LakerGMC DAR/Batum/Parsons/Randle/Whiteside with JC off the bench and potentially a top pick is a playoff team. 6-8 but payoffs IMO.
TheArmoTrader	710643945429032960	2016-03-18T01:48:14	LakerGMC Huh. Those are the best free-agents after KD. You definitely want 3 of those guys if you can get 'em.
TheArmoTrader	710643296024993792	2016-03-18T01:45:39	LakerGMC True, but remember, that dumbass deadline. Jim might be pressured into getting some more quality guys.
TheArmoTrader	710643138847580160	2016-03-18T01:45:02	LakerGMC I don't think so.  Why would guys like Bazemore, Batum, Mahinmi, Whiteside, Parsons wait for KD? $ is out there.
TheArmoTrader	710642333696430080	2016-03-18T01:41:50	LakerGMC Don't have to be max guys. Could be 3 high quality, 1 mid-tier players. I'm sure LAL prefers EBR w/ JC.
TheArmoTrader	710642091232112640	2016-03-18T01:40:52	LakerGMC As for KD, I'm not sure he'll have his decision by 7/5. That's pretty early. LBJ waited until Jul 12 to decide 2 years ago.
TheArmoTrader	710641515660378112	2016-03-18T01:38:35	LakerGMC No but that's the thing, I assume they wanna (will?) use early bird rights to sign JC, and not cap space.
TheArmoTrader	710639665284382720	2016-03-18T01:31:13	LakerGMC  +will agree to deals quicker, since they can sign them quicker. Before, they wouldve had 12 days to decide since no rush to sign.
TheArmoTrader	710639537718824960	2016-03-18T01:30:43	LakerGMC  1) Clarkson offer by another team now can come v. early 2) If they do the whole "Wait for KD to decide thing", other FAs+

TheArmoTrader	710550827971190784	2016-03-17T19:38:13	brosales12 SO BAYLOR. Would suck because I want to see Prince vs Ingram.
TheArmoTrader	710550443726778368	2016-03-17T19:36:41	colezwicker Daniel? I could see him go early-mid 2nd round this year. I mean, prospects ~ #40-100 not that different.
TheArmoTrader	710549935809138688	2016-03-17T19:34:40	colezwicker Him and Isaac (UCLA, similar ish game) just seem so not athletic. Tho Daniel has better prospects due to height
TheArmoTrader	710549631340453889	2016-03-17T19:33:28	JustRyCole he's the youngest
TheArmoTrader	710549545852149760	2016-03-17T19:33:07	JustRyCole Yeah. 1 year younger than Isaac
TheArmoTrader	710544594358788097	2016-03-17T19:13:27	DavidSchawel Kansas can compete with them. Also, they've lost to NCAA teams (N. Iowa, Texas, Duke, ND, UVA), so an upset is very possible.

TheArmoTrader	710377310893912064	2016-03-17T08:08:43	JustRyCole you post yours? I wanna add more upsets, but just can't.
TheArmoTrader	710376859624550400	2016-03-17T08:06:56	So yeah, here's my official bracket. Expect it to be busted by the time I have lunch tomorrow. 
TheArmoTrader	710366788974878720	2016-03-17T07:26:55	aaaaahronen Like I told the other earlier, in the NBA, he's not going to be able to beat some of these guys.
TheArmoTrader	710366170679889920	2016-03-17T07:24:27	JacobRude AnthonyIrwinLA ...but then you get into rim-protection issues big time.
TheArmoTrader	710365957567287297	2016-03-17T07:23:36	aaaaahronen Nobody's denying he's talented. People have issue w/ his potential NBA fit and how his weaknesses will affect him.
TheArmoTrader	710365642751258624	2016-03-17T07:22:21	NazzerLim AnthonyIrwinLA JacobRude It's not nitpicking. This is a serious issue.1 that the team has to consider when weighing risk/reward
TheArmoTrader	710365397501943808	2016-03-17T07:21:23	AnthonyIrwinLA JacobRude Hmm, I'm certain "Ben Simmons" isn't how you spell "Brandon Ingram".
TheArmoTrader	710364595790094336	2016-03-17T07:18:12	JacobRude AnthonyIrwinLA It's possible. But right now, this is all we can go on. I'm just getting a very Okafor-esque vibe w/ him.
TheArmoTrader	710363944985071616	2016-03-17T07:15:37	AnthonyIrwinLA JacobRude Yeah, and in the NBA, with smarter defenses, and stronger/better athlethes, I worry
TheArmoTrader	710363810616385536	2016-03-17T07:15:05	AnthonyIrwinLA JacobRude +to some extent. Pero Antic is a perfect example,dude was a bad 3P shooter! But he still shot &amp; made guys contest
TheArmoTrader	710363634833043457	2016-03-17T07:14:23	AnthonyIrwinLA JacobRude Problem with non-shooters is that you dont put pressure on defenses to account for shots. As a bad shooter,you do
TheArmoTrader	710363409590583297	2016-03-17T07:13:29	AnthonyIrwinLA JacobRude This is true. But once you have teams realize, "Oh, just play free-safety when this guy is outside" ---&gt;bad.
TheArmoTrader	710363218724585472	2016-03-17T07:12:43	JacobRude AnthonyIrwinLA Lol, his like one jump shot of his LSU career?
TheArmoTrader	710362735951745025	2016-03-17T07:10:48	JacobRude AnthonyIrwinLA DX's latest breakdown also had examples. And I always see it too. I HATE non-shooters.
TheArmoTrader	710362483307913220	2016-03-17T07:09:48	JacobRude AnthonyIrwinLA He's Rondo man. He doesn't look to shoot when he should. 
TheArmoTrader	710361520161497088	2016-03-17T07:05:58	JacobRude AnthonyIrwinLA Problem with Simmons isn't that he's MKG-like (tho his shot isn't perfect). Problem is he's Rondo.
TheArmoTrader	710361396387549184	2016-03-17T07:05:29	JacobRude AnthonyIrwinLA I mean, it's gotten better but he's still far from being an average shooter.
TheArmoTrader	710360668713537536	2016-03-17T07:02:35	JacobRude AnthonyIrwinLA MKG fixed his jumper?
TheArmoTrader	710346146707705857	2016-03-17T06:04:53	gotvatch lmaoo
TheArmoTrader	710343169989185536	2016-03-17T05:53:03	RyanKelapire He's worth a flier IMO. Yeah, Dudley isn't perfect but he'd be a nice veteran piece that can help the young guys.
TheArmoTrader	710342624398344192	2016-03-17T05:50:53	RyanKelapire I like Biyombo, Zeller, Dedmon as C options (think latter 2 dont get qualifying offers). Hairston, Lance Thomas, Dudley for SF
TheArmoTrader	710340598138425344	2016-03-17T05:42:50	RyanKelapire Bazemore is this year's Middleton. He's not a lower level FA anymore. Mahinmi also gonna get paid as well. Other 2 are eh.
TheArmoTrader	710340410640470020	2016-03-17T05:42:06	Juicemanji I just wished his team played him more. A lot of his stock his so much potential
TheArmoTrader	710339583997677572	2016-03-17T05:38:48	Juicemanji btw he turned 18 in November
TheArmoTrader	710339431568281600	2016-03-17T05:38:12	Juicemanji I might take him over Simmons at 2.
TheArmoTrader	710329305037836289	2016-03-17T04:57:58	RyanKelapire aggh, urgh. Going w/ latter
TheArmoTrader	710320242593890304	2016-03-17T04:21:57	JuiceLogan 30 games isn't that big of a sample. It should definitely be weighed more than HS stuff, but still not a lot of info.
TheArmoTrader	710316918373126144	2016-03-17T04:08:45	gotvatch Big men just in general take a while to get going, especially if they are young. Look @ Biyombo. Looks like a legit starting C now
TheArmoTrader	710316387651035136	2016-03-17T04:06:38	JuiceLogan Lance is another one that fits this bill, tho not to the degree of DAJ.  Again, it's pretty rare. But payoff can be big.
TheArmoTrader	710315350290616320	2016-03-17T04:02:31	JuiceLogan Like, if Skal fell out of the 1st, and was there for the taking at 32 for the Lakers, I'd be pissed if they passed up on him
TheArmoTrader	710314862073634817	2016-03-17T04:00:34	JuiceLogan Yeah, I mean, it's not always the case. 9.5/10 youre not gonna get a player like him. But the 0.5 it works, payoff is huge.
TheArmoTrader	710314682674876416	2016-03-17T03:59:52	gotvatch Yeah, it took, what? 4 year until he become a contributer.
TheArmoTrader	710314171934486528	2016-03-17T03:57:50	FlyByKnite gotta give refs props for consistency at least
TheArmoTrader	710313712037400576	2016-03-17T03:56:00	DeAndre Jordan is why u take a shot in the 2nd rd on a former highly-touted recruit who had a bad freshman year. DAJ was once projected top5
TheArmoTrader	710310327347322880	2016-03-17T03:42:33	LifeOfABruin That he might transfer? Sure.
TheArmoTrader	710309997234642944	2016-03-17T03:41:14	LifeOfABruin Yeah, way too many factors to figure out now. Guessing he's in the same wide range as Zimmer right now.
TheArmoTrader	710309131844919296	2016-03-17T03:37:48	LifeOfABruin Oh man. I dunno. Is he better than Zimmerman? Zimm's going 14-30 this year.  As for 2018 - wayyy too out to project
TheArmoTrader	710308237820571648	2016-03-17T03:34:15	LifeOfABruin ??
TheArmoTrader	710296977192329216	2016-03-17T02:49:30	insomniacslounj I approve

TheArmoTrader	710288040967602176	2016-03-17T02:14:00	insomniacslounj That's cute and all, but FireAlford crowd (which includes BRO) uses BH as some type of perfect exemplar

TheArmoTrader	710283710273232896	2016-03-17T01:56:47	HerbieVerstinks Ya I'm to the point where letting him go is prob better since this shit is annoying/hurting program. Feels too lame-ducky
TheArmoTrader	710281900003201024	2016-03-17T01:49:36	HerbieVerstinks You see BRO's hit piece on Alford? Makes Howland to come out as a saint lolololol. He's 50% of of the fucken reason we here

TheArmoTrader	710177715396022272	2016-03-16T18:55:36	FlyByKnite Altho, if there are any contractual issues stopping him from coming over right away, then yeah, I can see them going another way
TheArmoTrader	710177496247894016	2016-03-16T18:54:44	FlyByKnite Think they go for Ben &amp; Brandon at 1/2 (or vice-versa) but I can see them taking DB @ 3 if they think he's the 3rd best prospect

TheArmoTrader	709463562536689664	2016-03-14T19:37:49	FlyByKnite I'm guessing that's a minority of bar owners - at least, I hope it is.
TheArmoTrader	709463354809540608	2016-03-14T19:36:59	brosales12 U see the latest DX mock? Every1 we talked about available @ 32. But they have us taking Diallo (who's fine from a value view)
TheArmoTrader	709452132089356290	2016-03-14T18:52:23	HerbieVerstinks Lol, I dunno. Maybe the guy who UNLV canned? I was gonna say Gotfried but he's not Byron bad.
TheArmoTrader	709451394130911232	2016-03-14T18:49:27	HerbieVerstinks Oh man, we're gonna have the D'Antoni to Byron replacement for college coaches, aren't we?
TheArmoTrader	709450602514755584	2016-03-14T18:46:19	erg79 HerbieVerstinks (This is why I partially wanted the Lakers to keep Byron last summer. Even for them, image/reputation is important)
TheArmoTrader	709450085516517376	2016-03-14T18:44:15	erg79 HerbieVerstinks Ya. Even if SA is let go,now the options r potentially limited to smaller-school coaches who want swing w/ big boys
TheArmoTrader	709449442596769792	2016-03-14T18:41:42	HerbieVerstinks You see this plane shit? LOL. Way to make the job more attractive! No big name/hot coach will want to come here now.

TheArmoTrader	709245973680140292	2016-03-14T05:13:11	Wait, the stolen car in this car chase/pursuit is a cop car?
TheArmoTrader	709228781634850816	2016-03-14T04:04:53	This was good. MMT is a good way to get the layperson a different look at the general understandings of economics.

TheArmoTrader	709222046165643264	2016-03-14T03:38:07	Lakers Nah. Russell, Clarkson, Randle aren't playing.
TheArmoTrader	709221941698109440	2016-03-14T03:37:42	LakerGMC Still think we should be fine, but ya not as clear cut anymore given Lakers recent surge and BKN ineptitude.
TheArmoTrader	709221627356012545	2016-03-14T03:36:27	JustRyCole This crap reminds me of the games Jeremy Lin/Jordan Hill won us last year. Ugh
TheArmoTrader	709221127365664768	2016-03-14T03:34:28	This Knicks-Lakers game is disgusting. All the young talent isn't playing. Lakers need the tank loss. Knicks are depressing. It's bad.
TheArmoTrader	709218149032275970	2016-03-14T03:22:38	HerbieVerstinks This game also looks disturbing.
TheArmoTrader	709199970318954497	2016-03-14T02:10:23	TJFsports HerbieVerstinks Does anybody think he's more than an average PF? Randle shares that same herky-jerky-esque shots @ the rim
TheArmoTrader	709199425856376832	2016-03-14T02:08:14	TJFsports HerbieVerstinks why the heck do you hate Thad Young? lol
TheArmoTrader	709198993406828544	2016-03-14T02:06:30	HerbieVerstinks Despite TJFsports's bearishness, I see the outline of a really useful player there. Something like Thad Young.
TheArmoTrader	709197144628944896	2016-03-14T01:59:10	HerbieVerstinks well I feel like that's randle but like 10x worse
TheArmoTrader	709197074894467072	2016-03-14T01:58:53	HerbieVerstinks Have u ever guarded big dudes in the post that just slam into your chest so hard that it makes u lose ur breath for a sec?
TheArmoTrader	709196651424927744	2016-03-14T01:57:12	TommyBeer Gibberman10 He's  restricted, so even if you threw him an offer, he can't sign until July 12 giving LA until July 15 to decide.
TheArmoTrader	709195561048494080	2016-03-14T01:52:52	brosales12 TommyBeer But what if NY gives Jim Buss the poison pill filled w/ ricin? It's possible Ben, NYK prez is sleeping w/Jim's sister
TheArmoTrader	709194807936069633	2016-03-14T01:49:53	sideoutpar MichaelMHanna This is bad to say, because even if u hate SA's coaching/recruiting, he hasn't done anything bad to his players
TheArmoTrader	709194219009609728	2016-03-14T01:47:32	Craigbball  Maybe! But as of now, I think KP maybe ends up being the 2nd most valuable player due to what he may do at C (rim protect/3s).
TheArmoTrader	709193754805018624	2016-03-14T01:45:41	BillMonty_ JustRyCole Craigbball I don't get how you can say that ("very likely"). Their  resumes are close so far.
TheArmoTrader	709193484507328512	2016-03-14T01:44:37	JustRyCole Craigbball You don't need to be the #1 option on your team to be highly valuable. See Pau, he shouldve gone #1 in '01.
TheArmoTrader	709192016698052608	2016-03-14T01:38:47	HerbieVerstinks Yep, I think so. Hopefully the vets can pull this one through.
TheArmoTrader	709191941045354499	2016-03-14T01:38:29	JustRyCole Craigbball So ya I think I'd go KAT, KP, DAR, Booker, Turner, Winslow, Jahlil, WCS, Portis, Mudiay
TheArmoTrader	709191298222194689	2016-03-14T01:35:56	HerbieVerstinks Will Kobe "save" the Lakers once more? Hopefully. ChuckTheBallKobe
TheArmoTrader	709191170388131840	2016-03-14T01:35:25	JustRyCole Craigbball I think KP's positional importance still makes him 2nd. But DAR's recent play has made the original gap much smaller
TheArmoTrader	709191037084782592	2016-03-14T01:34:54	Gibberman10 Only one of those pairs has a championship ring. JustSaying

TheArmoTrader	709183555247558656	2016-03-14T01:05:10	MichaelMHanna Yep, things can change, that's why I dont wanna do that now.
TheArmoTrader	709183336803999745	2016-03-14T01:04:18	MichaelMHanna BTW, before the season starts, we should both set out our reasonable expections. (Still early to do so now.)
TheArmoTrader	709182801870884864	2016-03-14T01:02:10	MichaelMHanna And you know me. If I see he underperforms next year/things are not right, my agnosticism will sway the other way.
TheArmoTrader	709182118799093760	2016-03-14T00:59:27	LifeOfABruin MichaelMHanna I'm not doing this anymore. I'm stopping right here. There's no way you guys are changing any POV.
TheArmoTrader	709181708017340416	2016-03-14T00:57:49	LifeOfABruin MichaelMHanna I'm so glad Howland (read: Carroll) left UCLA (USC) in such great condition recruiting wise!

TheArmoTrader	709181198719823872	2016-03-14T00:55:48	MichaelMHanna LifeOfABruin I'll give it to you guys that he had a few recruiting hiccups. But I mean, come on, next 2 classes=elite.
TheArmoTrader	709179622315806720	2016-03-14T00:49:32	LifeOfABruin KosherBruin MichaelMHanna There's no point to this. IF I bring up the stuff he did, you're just gonna discredit it.
TheArmoTrader	709178973624733696	2016-03-14T00:46:57	LifeOfABruin KosherBruin MichaelMHanna Andddddddd this is dead wrong.

TheArmoTrader	708931925273133056	2016-03-13T08:25:16	garykester Latter because there's so much more overwhelming evidence against him.
TheArmoTrader	708928678571462656	2016-03-13T08:12:22	This is true. In fact, there's a law on this.  
TheArmoTrader	708752211631742976	2016-03-12T20:31:09	slayinmaven damanr Think he spends 75% of his time at PF, and slides down or up based on matchups/etc the rest
TheArmoTrader	708751299051806720	2016-03-12T20:27:32	slayinmaven damanr He's like Blake Griffin. He can play 5 at times but not a lot a la Draymond. His length isn't great like you said

TheArmoTrader	708749373455216641	2016-03-12T20:19:53	damanr Lack of a jumper, intensity waivers at times, not that good defensively. And older freshman.  Of course you can attribute those+

TheArmoTrader	708740065271238656	2016-03-12T19:42:53	samesfandiari I'd warn you on going to old w/ roster. What did the '11 Lakers in. Old/tired feet. No youth. Tho your core is p young.

TheArmoTrader	708513772315389952	2016-03-12T04:43:41	LifeOfABruin JustRyCole Think he'll get to 6'2 at least, given that Lonzo and Liangelo are 6'5. He's young but early start gives him advtg
TheArmoTrader	708513125092368384	2016-03-12T04:41:07	JustRyCole he might end up the best one, which is nuts to say b/c Lonzo's a likely lotto pick

TheArmoTrader	708403506709798912	2016-03-11T21:25:32	BillMonty_ NBADraftWass especially given the asset/talent-overlap issues I stated. I think it's close, hence my preference for BI.

TheArmoTrader	708401339777339392	2016-03-11T21:16:55	NBADraftWass That's why I think Ingram has more support for #1 despite your original statement. Fit's an issue, given BS isn't LBJ/AD type.
TheArmoTrader	708400885471191042	2016-03-11T21:15:07	NBADraftWass Yeah (I'd trade Okafor). For LA, they might be forced to trade Randle.

TheArmoTrader	708008558403563520	2016-03-10T19:16:09	JustRyCole Doesn't need =/= cant be beneficial.  He doesnt need to play 30MPG in SL. Plus, a good way to further build/add chemistry.
TheArmoTrader	708007786047614976	2016-03-10T19:13:04	JustRyCole Eh, I can see DAR using SL to expirement on some stuff. JC maybe wont even be under contract during SL + doesnt need it.

TheArmoTrader	706854071546679296	2016-03-07T14:48:38	DewNO JonathanTjarks But that's my exact point. Not arguing what's right or wrong. Arguing about ability to "get shit done"/pragmatism.

TheArmoTrader	706768055645306880	2016-03-07T09:06:50	DewNO ok then who decides which ideologies are worse and which are better?

TheArmoTrader	706706463524139009	2016-03-07T05:02:05	colezwicker Yeah about. Danny Green seems the closest but Valentine is a better playmaker. Iggy too athletic for comp.
TheArmoTrader	706697905503997957	2016-03-07T04:28:05	ryangsoares I dont see how. He's gonna go like 8-20, not good enough for our 1st rounder, not bad enough for our 2nd rounder
TheArmoTrader	706689524940689412	2016-03-07T03:54:47	ryangsoares He might be better than Sacre,but that's not the issue @ hand here. Its him making an impact when he's given chance. IE - Black
TheArmoTrader	706689261907488769	2016-03-07T03:53:44	ryangsoares IF he's healthy, I dont think he falls to 32. If he isn't, then makes it a dicey gamble.
TheArmoTrader	706688299545423872	2016-03-07T03:49:54	ryangsoares We dont have anything to lose. He does. If he comes in, isn't ready (he's not), chances of getting 2nd chance is slim.
TheArmoTrader	706687696442241024	2016-03-07T03:47:31	ryangsoares He's ~2 years younger than Hammons, so if in a year or 2 he's ready, he's got a long career ahead of him.

TheArmoTrader	706586481092001792	2016-03-06T21:05:19	mattvazin What a cocky punk. Reacting positively to your teammate's success? Wow. He needs to be sent to the locker room for that.
TheArmoTrader	706585158808244224	2016-03-06T21:00:04	Interesting what-if about Clarkson: If the Lakers had their original 2nd rounder (at #36), would they have taken him there or someone else?
TheArmoTrader	706582196388122624	2016-03-06T20:48:17	jordanbrianl dude, we always get food from Sipan haha. They're pretty good.
TheArmoTrader	706580512228245508	2016-03-06T20:41:36	jordanbrianl Interesting. Don't think I've had an olive/mushroom one. Usually just cheese/spinach/potato.
TheArmoTrader	706579543230787584	2016-03-06T20:37:45	LakersSBN DAR holding his own vs Curry. JC having a solid game after his injury. Randle going 1 on 1 vs Draymond and succeeding.
TheArmoTrader	706579389945769984	2016-03-06T20:37:08	jordanbrianl Nice. What type of Beorek is it? Just plain cheese?  Make sure you squeeze some lemon onto the lahmajune.
TheArmoTrader	706219950688575493	2016-03-05T20:48:51	I had an extended discussion with TheArmoTrader at LakersSBN about the Lakers' options at #32. Give it a gander: 
TheArmoTrader	706556086933827584	2016-03-06T19:04:32	Kabobs are better than both.  
TheArmoTrader	706552665002496000	2016-03-06T18:50:57	adamcarstens woah, California is actually going to matter in an election? Crazy.
TheArmoTrader	706550922978066432	2016-03-06T18:44:01	mattbilinsky FWIW, Horford's and Millsap's rim protection s: 49 and 50% respectively....50% is about the NBA average.
TheArmoTrader	706549820920434688	2016-03-06T18:39:39	FlyByKnite who's the last major NBA star to go out on top? David Robinson?
TheArmoTrader	706542067682398208	2016-03-06T18:08:50	erinscafe Glad you're back and feeling better. Your absence is felt on here.
TheArmoTrader	706541519159709696	2016-03-06T18:06:39	samesfandiari garykester This works as a great advantage during the seasons we want to win.  Not so much this year. +2 Ws b/c of it.
TheArmoTrader	706540259928969216	2016-03-06T18:01:39	georgepearkes oh man, George. My condolences to what you're going through right now.
TheArmoTrader	706393837074149377	2016-03-06T08:19:49	hmfaigen Niceee. Is that the 1948 trophy? Or the 1950? 1952? 1953? 1954? 1972? 1980? 1982? 1985? 1987? 1988? 2000? 2001? 2002? 2009? 2010?
TheArmoTrader	706392840029384704	2016-03-06T08:15:51	hmfaigen Yeah, that's one of the appeals. Especially since its in the facility where LAL practices at. It's cool being there.
TheArmoTrader	706391921598435328	2016-03-06T08:12:12	hmfaigen  1) Cool, I've been itching to go to one. 2) Del Harris was a good/underrated coach. 3) Why are we talking in numbers?
TheArmoTrader	706391059933192193	2016-03-06T08:08:47	hmfaigen vanexel31  1) Sick, was this your first DL game? 2) All the KB stories are all similar, this guy was nuts. But great.
TheArmoTrader	706382341694861312	2016-03-06T07:34:08	erinscafe Wait. Where are you?
TheArmoTrader	706356460351979520	2016-03-06T05:51:18	samesfandiari mattbilinsky Hes not THAT young,but not old either. Shld b a good contributor &amp; will get better w/experience. $12M is my max
TheArmoTrader	706356147104526336	2016-03-06T05:50:03	samesfandiari mattbilinsky Yeah, I'm not disagreeing with this! Heck, I saw this when he was with LA 
TheArmoTrader	706354638908293120	2016-03-06T05:44:04	LifeOfABruin MichaelMHanna And see, if he has a whatever year with that talent next year (barring some situations), I'll be on your side
TheArmoTrader	706354187148263424	2016-03-06T05:42:16	MichaelMHanna FireAlford crowd should be happy he didnt get another extension tonight ;)
TheArmoTrader	706353531020640256	2016-03-06T05:39:39	MichaelMHanna I know lots disagree, but this is the right move.
TheArmoTrader	706353003125575681	2016-03-06T05:37:34	mattbilinsky He's good, like top-20 ish good. Dont think he's top-10.   Think complaint w/ KB is he goes under screens a lot.
TheArmoTrader	706351048823181313	2016-03-06T05:29:48	mattbilinsky Again, I go to the team effort/Budenholzer thing. Millsap + Horford + Baze + Thabo + Teague/Korver/Schroder being OK=#2 D
TheArmoTrader	706350155193159682	2016-03-06T05:26:15	Misha Tate just beat Holly Holm? Am I seeing that right?
TheArmoTrader	706349805136535552	2016-03-06T05:24:51	mattbilinsky Millsap &amp; Horford are probably top-10 defenders at their positions.  And Thabo is legit as well. Teague/Korver OK. Team effort
TheArmoTrader	706348595864207360	2016-03-06T05:20:03	xchuyx3 mattbilinsky I'll still pay him $10-$12M to come back to LA. Something like $35M/3 years.
TheArmoTrader	706348048947871749	2016-03-06T05:17:52	LifeOfABruin Of course I care. But I dont think the answer is what you think the answer is.
TheArmoTrader	706347854403497984	2016-03-06T05:17:06	mattbilinsky I dont think so. He's pretty good, but probably not top 10. FWIW: 
TheArmoTrader	706346744372572160	2016-03-06T05:12:41	LifeOfABruin loled at AH passing up an open corner 3 at the end.
TheArmoTrader	706339569260572673	2016-03-06T04:44:11	SmoothsHoops Wait, Utah won???
TheArmoTrader	706333576602607618	2016-03-06T04:20:22	Trump's literally standing there saying he'll do the stuff republicans hate Obama for ("extending the laws", "make laws stronger").
TheArmoTrader	706333022023344128	2016-03-06T04:18:10	Is this real life. Trump RT BrettLoGiurato: This just happened: "Do I hit the ball hard? Do I hit it long? Is Trump strong?"
TheArmoTrader	706321461653319680	2016-03-06T03:32:13	jordanbrianl cool ending for the UVA seniors.
TheArmoTrader	706318759468752897	2016-03-06T03:21:29	88mugsy88 Nice
TheArmoTrader	706316386486734851	2016-03-06T03:12:03	HerbieVerstinks Ha, yeah, that crossed my mind too. chunkyish
TheArmoTrader	706315516541972480	2016-03-06T03:08:36	HerbieVerstinks I have a feeling the middle one is going to annoy a lot of fans.
TheArmoTrader	706310063695081472	2016-03-06T02:46:56	jordanbrianl Well, that's why we use averages, right? :)
TheArmoTrader	706296610100158467	2016-03-06T01:53:28	DavidSchawel They want to even add a 3rd round possibly during the next CBA negotiations!
TheArmoTrader	706295796614823937	2016-03-06T01:50:14	If you read draft piece b/w me &amp; brosales12 , 2 prospects discussed (Onuaku,Brogdon) r playing eachother rn on ESPN.
TheArmoTrader	706294700676755456	2016-03-06T01:45:53	askmeabouthelaw HerbieVerstinks Will bounce back next year. This was partially expected, tho I thought we'd be a little better.
TheArmoTrader	706294205874774016	2016-03-06T01:43:55	HerbieVerstinks lol yeah
TheArmoTrader	706294182076219392	2016-03-06T01:43:49	HerbieVerstinks ugh but Holiday shouldve shot that 3. Freshman mistake
TheArmoTrader	706293980590272513	2016-03-06T01:43:01	HerbieVerstinks great call Firealford cant believe he turned the ball over there
TheArmoTrader	706293529727754240	2016-03-06T01:41:14	HerbieVerstinks TP steal at halfcourt + missed open layup to perfectly cap of his career in a ucla uniform
TheArmoTrader	706293137270923265	2016-03-06T01:39:40	HerbieVerstinks YOOOO you watching?
TheArmoTrader	706293049400414209	2016-03-06T01:39:19	Noahpinion So Clinton's the natural best option. America needs zzzzz, we don't need a "Revolution".
TheArmoTrader	706278056072077312	2016-03-06T00:39:45	LifeOfABruin Yeah that's possible. Or maybe Kasich so they try to take Ohio instead
TheArmoTrader	706277471700652032	2016-03-06T00:37:25	JohnnyNBA CLE. I want sad Simmons.
TheArmoTrader	706277363437301760	2016-03-06T00:37:00	One can say that Ted is cruzing to another victory.   
TheArmoTrader	706274227612090370	2016-03-06T00:24:32	samesfandiari Wow DG a triple double whore?  
TheArmoTrader	706266728796323840	2016-03-05T23:54:44	SherwoodStrauss Thanks to Coach K's popovichian evolution to a Calapari-type recruiter.
TheArmoTrader	706266465763110912	2016-03-05T23:53:41	Already have them. Here you go:  
TheArmoTrader	706265726311530496	2016-03-05T23:50:45	kcbill agwarner lol. But for Poythress, he wouldve been a 1st round pick after his freshman year.
TheArmoTrader	706264959001362432	2016-03-05T23:47:42	agwarner Yep. 9/10 times, if you're a first round pick, better to take the $. Can always go back to school if needed
TheArmoTrader	706249354152005632	2016-03-05T22:45:42	rafael_uehara Must have been an egg avi.
TheArmoTrader	706249008298131456	2016-03-05T22:44:19	rafael_uehara Even if he was stuck in 90s basketball.....has there ever been a +7 foot SF? Outside a few 6'11 ish guys, dont think so.
TheArmoTrader	706248416079122432	2016-03-05T22:41:58	69th floor? Nice.  
TheArmoTrader	706247619517874176	2016-03-05T22:38:48	Chris_Reichert Any insight on how Levi Randolph's been doing? Kinda liked him as an UDFA option coming out of Bama
TheArmoTrader	706247554678132736	2016-03-05T22:38:33	DannyLeroux Byron Scott laughs at you! RyanKelly
TheArmoTrader	706241508106588160	2016-03-05T22:14:31	Chris_Reichert Thanks! I kinda like Miller, based on the 10mins of highlights I watched, lol. He's interesting b/c long/jumpy/can shoot.
TheArmoTrader	706236472769142784	2016-03-05T21:54:31	Chris_Reichert Between Julian Washburn, Malcolm Miller, CJ Fair, and Ledo, who do you think has the most NBA potential/deserves a call-up?
TheArmoTrader	706233216466702338	2016-03-05T21:41:34	Oh my. 
TheArmoTrader	706224416292630528	2016-03-05T21:06:36	daothermike Yep, but even besides that. Scouts tear you apart more the longer you stay, regardless of school.
TheArmoTrader	706224009763954688	2016-03-05T21:04:59	LifeOfABruin Yeah, we might need to call up someone now.
TheArmoTrader	706223568430850048	2016-03-05T21:03:14	billoram WHAT. Damnit./
TheArmoTrader	706223423207309312	2016-03-05T21:02:39	JuiceLogan Yep that's why, in 9.5/10 cases, I think guys should almost always go pro. Risk of falling is &gt;&gt;&gt; than reward of rising.
TheArmoTrader	706222090341355520	2016-03-05T20:57:21	Always cool to see a 5* guy like Alex Poythress stay 4years in school,but 1 cant help to think if he wouldve been better if he left after 1.
TheArmoTrader	706220550490685440	2016-03-05T20:51:14	hmfaigen Come on over to Ben and Jerry's Draft Parlour 
TheArmoTrader	706219241243078657	2016-03-05T20:46:02	.brosales12 and TheArmoTrader debate: Who should the Lakers draft in the 2nd round?  
TheArmoTrader	706209992982925312	2016-03-05T20:09:17	rafael_uehara Well yeah, there's only so much spots for these fringe flier guys. There'd be more if teams were most "paper based" IYKWIM.
TheArmoTrader	706208650570784768	2016-03-05T20:03:57	rafael_uehara Here's the issue. Lots of teams prefer to have  James Joneses,World Peaces at end of bench instead of Beasleys,Jakars,Quincys
TheArmoTrader	706206978859663360	2016-03-05T19:57:19	samesfandiari Missed this. I'm still not sure what u mean. P obvious he's not those guys but he'll be a huge upgrade which fans will enjoy
TheArmoTrader	706206256281706496	2016-03-05T19:54:26	rafael_uehara Believe LAL gave him a workout last year and elected not to sign him. Telling.  Maybe a BBIQ thing rather than tools thing?
TheArmoTrader	706205753455955968	2016-03-05T19:52:26	LakerGMC OK so he misses record for perfect FT game, but he technically holds the record for most consecutive FTs made in a 1 game, right?
TheArmoTrader	706205553467400193	2016-03-05T19:51:39	brosales12 Might be the new haircut
TheArmoTrader	706205258997846016	2016-03-05T19:50:29	brosales12 Yeah, and not just, "he made an open dunk".
TheArmoTrader	706202353150660608	2016-03-05T19:38:56	kpelton Hoping to see more Skal/Simmons matchups. Not a lot so far.

TheArmoTrader	705989921387859968	2016-03-05T05:34:48	ems_b Bourbon.
TheArmoTrader	705989678306996224	2016-03-05T05:33:50	Yo. Trying Four Roses Signal Barrel for the first time tonight and oh my god.
TheArmoTrader	705980460854153216	2016-03-05T04:57:13	LakersOutsiders A bust, why we shouldn't sign him this summer
TheArmoTrader	705980343619223552	2016-03-05T04:56:45	afa_brain LakerGMC Yeah, 2 more wins before we get another W and I think we'll have some nice distance b/w us.
TheArmoTrader	705980178803994624	2016-03-05T04:56:05	samesfandiari huh
TheArmoTrader	705979945529421824	2016-03-05T04:55:10	LakerGMC We need 6 wins in 19 games to catch them at their current total. We have 12 in 62. It's not happening, lol.
TheArmoTrader	705979007464919042	2016-03-05T04:51:26	hmfaigen "I decided to not sign with the Lakers because a non-affiliated blog posted a vine of me getting dunked on that one time"
TheArmoTrader	705977115275952128	2016-03-05T04:43:55	FEPurpleNGold Yep, lets hope they can leap past Minny now, doubt it, but hopeful
TheArmoTrader	705976270006300673	2016-03-05T04:40:33	Nets just took the lead 121-120 w/ 0.4 left, on a Lopez tip in over DEN. They win this, and LAL fans can count them out for #2 tank race.
TheArmoTrader	705975541422170112	2016-03-05T04:37:40	rafael_uehara I've heard a poor mans Draymond (on D) for him. That's pretty good for a bench guy.
TheArmoTrader	705971391871393792	2016-03-05T04:21:10	rafael_uehara Yeah, his potential on D is interesting.
TheArmoTrader	705969431105527808	2016-03-05T04:13:23	billoram Huertas your sense of humor come from?
TheArmoTrader	705968870629060608	2016-03-05T04:11:09	basquiatball Huertas 'Young bass world peace' come from? Indiana?
TheArmoTrader	705961968209793024	2016-03-05T03:43:44	mattbilinsky he's like 4th or 5th in ISO frequency. That's ridiculous for a rookie, even if you control for BS's dumb system.

TheArmoTrader	705959636441010177	2016-03-05T03:34:28	brosales12 We did?
TheArmoTrader	705959433147318272	2016-03-05T03:33:39	mbusigin wow, never has been below 5.0% (outside that small little wick in the 00s)?

TheArmoTrader	705939868451360768	2016-03-05T02:15:55	HerbieVerstinks I mean, I get why he does it, but yeah, it is kinda dicky.
TheArmoTrader	705937903545774080	2016-03-05T02:08:06	HerbieVerstinks Phew, yeah, I thought that was for that.
TheArmoTrader	705937499655315456	2016-03-05T02:06:30	HerbieVerstinks I hope the "mind-bottling" part was done on purpose/inside-joke attempt.

TheArmoTrader	705926786484338688	2016-03-05T01:23:56	Ah. So if he follows those guys' footsteps....he'll be playing elsewhere shortly.

TheArmoTrader	704393708527980545	2016-02-29T19:52:01	brosales12 Yeah, do agree that basketball wise, it does seem like a natural next step for him. Wouldnt mind him on the DFenders
TheArmoTrader	704392539294412800	2016-02-29T19:47:23	AnthonyIrwinLA No, I meant, like next year. Bass/Kelly will be gone.  Hibbert should be replaced by someone who can run.
TheArmoTrader	704392006437482496	2016-02-29T19:45:15	brosales12 Only has 21 career games playing &gt; 20mins. Why do I feel like he hasn't been in the right opportunity yet?
TheArmoTrader	704391332022718465	2016-02-29T19:42:35	AnthonyIrwinLA BTW, I'd be down to bring him on to play in the "Ryan Kelly" role. 3rd PF. If we move to a fast-paced offense, might fit in
TheArmoTrader	704390969869742080	2016-02-29T19:41:08	AnthonyIrwinLA I think it's cuz we feel sorry for him, how CLE messed him up. Should've never been #1.

TheArmoTrader	704191836693274625	2016-02-29T06:29:51	damanr That's mainly due to the whole resting starters in the 4th thing for the Ws. GS 1-3Q point differential blows SA's out of the water

TheArmoTrader	704089251395207168	2016-02-28T23:42:13	RyanKelapire AnthonyIrwinLA Scott aspect has more to do w/ business+placating Kobe than basketball decision. Isn't black/white. (1/2)
TheArmoTrader	704088804383072256	2016-02-28T23:40:26	AnthonyIrwinLA Well, that's mostly semantics, since the front office (even w/ "off handsy" owners) is an extension of the ownership

TheArmoTrader	704088102873075714	2016-02-28T23:37:39	AnthonyIrwinLA To willfully ignore what caused that slip (Veto+reasonable bets that didn't payoff+Kobe's decline) would be v shortsighted.
TheArmoTrader	704087399412838400	2016-02-28T23:34:51	AnthonyIrwinLA ...so that makes them the "worst ownership in sports"?? That they aren't willy-nilly giving all their updates to the public?

TheArmoTrader	703735598767419392	2016-02-28T00:16:56	jordanbrianl Yeah, he doesn't seem like the fastest guy. But that's why he won't be a 1st round pick (+ age). 2nd round very likely IMO.

TheArmoTrader	703715490770780160	2016-02-27T22:57:02	CTKwasniewski brosales12 Him and Oden would be going head to head as the best lob+defensive centers in the NBA right now :(
TheArmoTrader	703715317738926081	2016-02-27T22:56:20	brosales12 CTKwasniewski Ha, fair. Just man,he's so old,I cant get over it.By the time he plays an NBA game,Bynum was working on AS season
TheArmoTrader	703714796873515009	2016-02-27T22:54:16	CTKwasniewski Funny thing: When Bynum was Hammons' age, he was already a 2 time champion. Whew cc: brosales12
TheArmoTrader	703709036244406273	2016-02-27T22:31:23	TheStalwart Oh yeah, yeah, I remember that guy! My theoretical vote in 2003 was for him!
TheArmoTrader	703708673764274176	2016-02-27T22:29:56	TheStalwart who?

TheArmoTrader	703666341119524864	2016-02-27T19:41:43	LifeOfABruin did someone call the waaahmbulance? for the dude that wrote that? Once Barkley's analysis was quoted,whole thing became a joke
TheArmoTrader	703664527338926080	2016-02-27T19:34:31	haeklund Do you also hate puppies? Ice Cream?
TheArmoTrader	703664156742852608	2016-02-27T19:33:03	Bill Walton just praised Steph Curry without any "buts" or exceptions. Take note, old NBA heads.  This is why BillWalton is the best.
TheArmoTrader	703647177596231681	2016-02-27T18:25:34	MileHighBrendan woahwoahwoahwoah...when did the handle change happen???
TheArmoTrader	703647017206087680	2016-02-27T18:24:56	JustRyCole Remember us talking about Dedmon? Might be a nice cheap option if we strike out on the bigger names  
TheArmoTrader	703643827429470208	2016-02-27T18:12:16	AnthonyIrwinLA I'm a fan of Fosters.  Both the beer and the ice cream place (only SoCal people will get this).
TheArmoTrader	703643434259582977	2016-02-27T18:10:42	AnthonyIrwinLA You think Fosters is bitter?

TheArmoTrader	703474908949385217	2016-02-27T07:01:02	DanielBaldonado its gonna be pretty fun. I WISH Lonzo stayed for 2 years, but I cant blame him for being a one and done
TheArmoTrader	703474396120248320	2016-02-27T06:59:00	brosales12 Either scenario would be hilarious, if it wasn't for the fact that the Lakers future was affected by it.
TheArmoTrader	703473503849226240	2016-02-27T06:55:27	brosales12 I'm convinced he's fucking with us. He knows he's gone.
