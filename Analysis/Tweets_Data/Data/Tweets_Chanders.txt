Chanders	700021309569368064	2016-02-17T18:17:40	academicdave but that's industry / the Valley's fault, not the government, right? They are the ones who integrated all the systems.
Chanders	700020353976942593	2016-02-17T18:13:52	BiellaColeman so because illegal wiretapping may be harder (maybe? temporarily?) that means it should be impossible for legal purposes too?

Chanders	699653993748963328	2016-02-16T17:58:05	Chanders Hierarchy should matter less, indexing more. Good abstract + keywords to draw attention, great research to gain respect.

Chanders	699637492664901632	2016-02-16T16:52:31	Chanders It's a bit embarrassing when I have to explain to friends in other disciplines how much less exclusive publishing is in mass comm.
Chanders	699636716370595841	2016-02-16T16:49:26	Chanders juliasonnevend It def leads to serious funneling of our knowledge/production. I get criticized for studying too many things.
Chanders	699635720667971584	2016-02-16T16:45:29	Chanders Agree, plus when topical or general journals prioritize/exclude particular methods it limits the scope of what people can learn.
Chanders	699623264226832388	2016-02-16T15:55:59	juliasonnevend agreed. Sometimes in my dark moments I do wonder how much we are actually learning, though.

Chanders	699618258715090944	2016-02-16T15:36:05	Chanders yes, but stronger journal hierarchy could lead to less diversity of voices and approaches. Also hard on juniors...
Chanders	699617334466605056	2016-02-16T15:32:25	Chanders I don't think there are too many....but too many that just want to publish same old stuff. Tho I'm not as well read in past yr.

Chanders	699609982283751424	2016-02-16T15:03:12	Chanders There may be too many, but I think the hierarchy is fairly clear, at least for this internet researcher. No?
Chanders	699610607339831297	2016-02-16T15:05:41	... very young scholars plus field heterogeneity make keeping up w/ discipline &amp; larger synthesis of findings increasingly difficult (2/2)
