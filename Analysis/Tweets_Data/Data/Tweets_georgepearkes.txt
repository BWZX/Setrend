georgepearkes	726009306009751552	2016-04-29T11:24:41	sobata416 likewise, pleasant day and weekend to you
georgepearkes	726008868283781120	2016-04-29T11:22:57	sobata416 Do you think that's out of line with the share of stuff they post  that's not useless? I certainly don't.
georgepearkes	726008126370111488	2016-04-29T11:20:00	sobata416 Birdyword I think we are on the same page, but curious what you mean by 'overlooked'...they are one of biggest fin mkts sites?
georgepearkes	726007443248025602	2016-04-29T11:17:17	sobata416 Birdyword Right. We could debate the validity/signal ratio of said analysis, but exists. Again, don't think contradicts my above
georgepearkes	726007062560395264	2016-04-29T11:15:46	sobata416 Birdyword I totally agree! But that wasn't the original point I was making, I don't think..
georgepearkes	726006775183450112	2016-04-29T11:14:38	sobata416 Birdyword for example...these are from two most recent stories. 
georgepearkes	726006330578841600	2016-04-29T11:12:52	sobata416 Birdyword ah. don't disagree they provide other content there but safe to say content prod falls off a click w/o BBG data, no?
georgepearkes	726005795587018752	2016-04-29T11:10:44	sobata416 Birdyword I periodically read ZH. Not sure what you're arguing, could you elucidate further?
georgepearkes	726005627881947140	2016-04-29T11:10:04	BisphamGreen and then you have depletion rates....so I think fair to say that supply response to price burden of proof on bears for now.
georgepearkes	726005514442838016	2016-04-29T11:09:37	BisphamGreen also worth mentioning that rig counts have refused to tick up, same for other proxies in the shale patch.
georgepearkes	726005432750358528	2016-04-29T11:09:18	BisphamGreen WRT the 1/3rd of global prod outside of US/OPEC...well...it's probably a v different question.
georgepearkes	726005283366047744	2016-04-29T11:08:42	BisphamGreen yeah. I think q of what's lagged/not is a good and fair question; WRT US shale there must be a response but haven't seen yet
georgepearkes	726003902072688640	2016-04-29T11:03:13	BisphamGreen again, whether that's enough to justify price action a *totally* different question.
georgepearkes	726003819050618880	2016-04-29T11:02:53	BisphamGreen oh I disagree there. Marginal barrel is being shut in, inventory growth slowing, demand ripping. All improvements at margin.

georgepearkes	725703232958398464	2016-04-28T15:08:28	IvanTheK anyhow....not a panacea of course. But I still think far superior to bilateral from systemic risk POV. Thx for your thoughts.
georgepearkes	725702890447364096	2016-04-28T15:07:06	IvanTheK which wasn't true in bilateral world.
georgepearkes	725702845396320256	2016-04-28T15:06:55	IvanTheK I guess the "1place" pt is that if you can ensure liquidity to the CCP, it solves many of the problems for system as a whole.
georgepearkes	725702677687095296	2016-04-28T15:06:15	IvanTheK sure, but the fragmentation here is orders of magnitudes lower than bilateral, no?
georgepearkes	725701617203466242	2016-04-28T15:02:03	IvanTheK Agree (I used to do that work flow every day!). Just not sure I'm following your point and how it relates to above?

georgepearkes	725701011986366465	2016-04-28T14:59:38	IvanTheK you mean call performing clients for additional margin to offset default of another client?
georgepearkes	725700513807917056	2016-04-28T14:57:40	rafaminos I'm sure the only weakness here is the grey stuff between my ears...
georgepearkes	725700406291107840	2016-04-28T14:57:14	IvanTheK so I don't think it's at all unfair to claim that the trouble will all be in one place and therefore easier to understand.
georgepearkes	725700293434941440	2016-04-28T14:56:47	IvanTheK whereas with CP risk in 2008, you had thousands of chains through thousands of actors. CCP model concentrates intentionally.
georgepearkes	725700147213139969	2016-04-28T14:56:12	IvanTheK totally agree it's a potential subsidy. My pt is if a CCP is in trouble, definitionally all the collateral chains run thru 1 place
georgepearkes	725699957911621632	2016-04-28T14:55:27	rafaminos I'm having an unusually hard time getting my head around this. Will have to return in the future. TYVM for the details!

georgepearkes	725698487720022016	2016-04-28T14:49:36	rafaminos no I mean I understand the fix, I just don't get the intuition of why chained prices are not additive.
georgepearkes	725698144302936065	2016-04-28T14:48:15	IvanTheK if a CCP does run in to trouble, it can be fixed very quickly and easily; that's totally untrue of dark bilateral unnetted market
georgepearkes	725698029454548992	2016-04-28T14:47:47	IvanTheK Given the historic record for CCP clearing in futures markets and the events of 2008, I totally disagree with that.
georgepearkes	725697382575304705	2016-04-28T14:45:13	Plays out in current economic views as well. CrustyvsDoeEyed 
georgepearkes	725697802131656704	2016-04-28T14:46:53	rafaminos I didn't really understand what the intuitive reason for that is.
georgepearkes	725697564029378561	2016-04-28T14:45:56	IvanTheK Couldn't easily find a numerically robust one so gave up for now. But my Q is: what's your alternative? Bilateral?
georgepearkes	725696646584131586	2016-04-28T14:42:17	IvanTheK Agree. I will say though...the events required to get to a solvency issue on the CME are something else. let me find waterfall.
georgepearkes	725696506511134721	2016-04-28T14:41:44	rafaminos hmm interesitng, thanks. yeah, I just did chain prices cont. to clarify, your calc is just chained/chained %chg * nom share?
georgepearkes	725694906405150720	2016-04-28T14:35:23	IvanTheK not sure on that, but if they have disco window access they certainly should!
georgepearkes	725694428799754241	2016-04-28T14:33:29	rafaminos checking, one sec.
georgepearkes	725694340660604928	2016-04-28T14:33:08	IvanTheK not impossible there could be a solvency event but it's a remarkably robust system from that perspective IMO
georgepearkes	725694252152426496	2016-04-28T14:32:47	IvanTheK sure. but have you looked at their default waterfall recently? combination of collateral and total capital is pretty impressive.
georgepearkes	725693878859386880	2016-04-28T14:31:18	IvanTheK Are you arguing that the CME could be in a position where it's solvency comes in to question on a large client default?
georgepearkes	725693714622980096	2016-04-28T14:30:38	kchoudhu it's been in the works for literally years and is not a huge surprise, but still represents a major shift in collateral systems.

georgepearkes	725692507703656452	2016-04-28T14:25:51	cc izakaminska on all of this...
georgepearkes	725692377193693184	2016-04-28T14:25:20	Also hurts money funds as it probably means cash will be stashed directly in the Fed acct instead of being invested w/ private CPs.
georgepearkes	725692203021029376	2016-04-28T14:24:38	Of course the flip side is it's basically the Fed admitting the CME is TBTF, and should be treated as such.
georgepearkes	725692090986954753	2016-04-28T14:24:11	This is big if you follow CCPs; dramatically reduces the likelihood of a waterfall "run" of defaults.

georgepearkes	725440180698624001	2016-04-27T21:43:11	SkeleCap that's pretty obviously not what I said.
georgepearkes	725439816444317696	2016-04-27T21:41:44	SkeleCap dropping poor Matt to save his notifications. Seeking benefits irrespective of costs is like, not a great concept.
georgepearkes	725439495034818561	2016-04-27T21:40:28	SkeleCap SMTuffy M_C_Klein I think you mean "so only the population as a whole" but sure, if that's what you want to call it.
georgepearkes	725439267376345088	2016-04-27T21:39:34	SkeleCap SMTuffy M_C_Klein I would also bet on it creating pernicious externalities, like other elite institutions (incl my alma mater)

georgepearkes	725438622233681921	2016-04-27T21:37:00	AbeLolisted M_C_Klein agreed. We can agree regardless of this convo that it's quite the day I agree with Summers too btw!!
georgepearkes	725438102664286208	2016-04-27T21:34:56	SkeleCap SMTuffy M_C_Klein what, immortal politicized capital maybe creates some bad outcomes? Don't think that's terribly controversial
georgepearkes	725437588551651329	2016-04-27T21:32:53	SkeleCap SMTuffy M_C_Klein damnit I misspelled rentierism again I'm sorry team
georgepearkes	725437513410699265	2016-04-27T21:32:35	SkeleCap SMTuffy M_C_Klein disagree. goal of preservation/growth of immortal capital in real terms is perfect definition of rentierim
georgepearkes	725437106202529792	2016-04-27T21:30:58	AbeLolisted M_C_Klein well on the former point we agree, at least.

georgepearkes	725435147923951617	2016-04-27T21:23:11	SMTuffy M_C_Klein it's ludicrous to assume that endowments should exist simply to grow and that is what Harvard's (and others) do.
georgepearkes	725435016742850560	2016-04-27T21:22:40	SMTuffy M_C_Klein you do realize Harvard's endowment has doubled in real terms since 1999? Sustainability &lt;&gt; indefinite compounding.
georgepearkes	725433774394216449	2016-04-27T21:17:44	SMTuffy M_C_Klein stock in this case is the endowment. Preservation of capital for preservation sake.
georgepearkes	725432610554548224	2016-04-27T21:13:06	M_C_Klein SMTuffy just like they are doing now.
georgepearkes	725429168918396928	2016-04-27T20:59:26	SMTuffy M_C_Klein IMO, not really. If the goal is to always have a pool of capital, yes. Otherwise no.
georgepearkes	725428607456272384	2016-04-27T20:57:12	conorsen then we're done.
georgepearkes	725428501365542912	2016-04-27T20:56:47	conorsen hey maybe! I have no idea.  I'm just making the argument that this FB bull case is aggressive, not crazy.
georgepearkes	725428344439881733	2016-04-27T20:56:09	osuwireless conorsen "presumably there will be other ad-related services" &lt;--- doesn't sound like new svcs to compete but just my read.
georgepearkes	725428202974416900	2016-04-27T20:55:36	SMTuffy M_C_Klein preservation of capital for the sake of preserving capital is called renierism and it's really, really bad.
georgepearkes	725428084724367362	2016-04-27T20:55:07	conorsen so this stagnation is a big headwind for Facebook's ad share? I mean surely you can't have both ways.
georgepearkes	725427772882096128	2016-04-27T20:53:53	conorsen aren't you the guy that argues we've seen stagnation in terms of app innovation...? :P
georgepearkes	725427319016398848	2016-04-27T20:52:05	conorsen I'm just saying you can see that growth path without nuking the entire rest of the industry.
georgepearkes	725426802726985728	2016-04-27T20:50:02	SMTuffy M_C_Klein I'm not arguing the managers of the endowments are doing wrong thing given mandate, but that mandate is wrong.
georgepearkes	725426623030374403	2016-04-27T20:49:19	JamesLiamCook smh
georgepearkes	725426481426522113	2016-04-27T20:48:45	conorsen like 2015 global ad spend is ~600bn USD give or take. So you have to assume v strong int'l growth but way less crazy than US only
georgepearkes	725426127238516736	2016-04-27T20:47:21	conorsen well it doesn't all have to come from the US ad market tho...?

georgepearkes	725425966768656384	2016-04-27T20:46:42	conorsen hmmmm not sure I agree with that but would need to run some numbers.

georgepearkes	725425679672692740	2016-04-27T20:45:34	conorsen am I crazy for thinking this is aggressive but not crazy?
georgepearkes	725425413103730689	2016-04-27T20:44:30	SMTuffy M_C_Klein Harvard is.

georgepearkes	725424579322208256	2016-04-27T20:41:12	It makes sense if the goal is to preserve the endowment for the sake of preserving it, sure!

georgepearkes	725385290005774337	2016-04-27T18:05:04	Post-Fed, markets read as slightly hawkish; 2s10s flatter, dollar up, spoos down.

georgepearkes	722089849424056323	2016-04-18T15:50:10	MylesUdland conorsen so my pt is that this is not NFLX having to go build organic from scratch. it's already key to FB use case.

georgepearkes	721052045403430912	2016-04-15T19:06:18	If you use headline inflation, US real rates lower now than in euro area &amp; Japan, which (may) explain some fx moves

georgepearkes	720622396760276992	2016-04-14T14:39:02	GavinHJackson DuncanWeldon no it doesn't. there's no actual capital exchange with a swap. that's why it's a swap.
georgepearkes	720621841811902464	2016-04-14T14:36:50	GavinHJackson DuncanWeldon no, it's because the swap curve is more liquid for hedging etc and bc of fixed-float hedging.
georgepearkes	720621208610451456	2016-04-14T14:34:19	GavinHJackson DuncanWeldon for evidence of this, just check out global swap spreads.
georgepearkes	720621090842812417	2016-04-14T14:33:51	GavinHJackson DuncanWeldon yes, and no. swaps have risk if the CCP is not the central gov't. also, swaps are not = actual bonds.

georgepearkes	719873298411220992	2016-04-12T13:02:23	6) That's it! But as a coda, glad we live in a country that has scale to have many independent CB teams looking at things from diff angles
georgepearkes	719872870592196609	2016-04-12T13:00:41	5) It will be fun to see the 2 models compete over time for estimating the Advance reading. However, my money is on FRBNY tracking of Final
georgepearkes	719872686919454720	2016-04-12T12:59:57	4) FRBNY does not have this weakness! Instead, it'll update right until Final release from the BEA. So my guess is it does better than ATL
georgepearkes	719872522414649344	2016-04-12T12:59:18	3) con't. However, weakness is that it doesn't revise tracking as the BEA does with more information. So it sucks at estimating Final.
georgepearkes	719872391753678850	2016-04-12T12:58:47	3) ATL Fed GDPNow is a tracker for Advance Estimate of GDP in a given Q from the BEA. It's not bad at that, usually better than consensus
georgepearkes	719872180612415488	2016-04-12T12:57:57	2) Also glad we have the teams at the district Federal Reserve banks. They do valuable work and in a sense compete; unique and aweome!

georgepearkes	718466806558683136	2016-04-08T15:53:29	Chris_arnade like, I get your PoV, and I often agree with it. But you often use entirely the wrong terms and ignore recent market changes.
georgepearkes	718466638102863873	2016-04-08T15:52:49	Chris_arnade so you want them *cleared*...fine, have you looked at what share is? Most IRS, index CDS, FX. OTC &lt;&gt; uncleared!!!
georgepearkes	718466065110540290	2016-04-08T15:50:33	Chris_arnade that's not how IRS work and you know it; how are issuers supposed to hedge each of their bonds' cash flows? no way exch works.
georgepearkes	718465656195309568	2016-04-08T15:48:55	Chris_arnade so you're not cool with IRS of any kind. gotcha.

georgepearkes	718464816529207296	2016-04-08T15:45:35	econhedge Oh I apologize, I misread your original reply. Agreed, same page.
georgepearkes	718464135223189504	2016-04-08T15:42:52	econhedge what I'm saying is, GDPNow takes SAAR from US Census. BEA does not, they are adjusting for residual seasonality.
georgepearkes	718463076786434048	2016-04-08T15:38:40	econhedge for example, inputs for construction. BEA does not simply take Census SAAR series at face. 
georgepearkes	718462170636361728	2016-04-08T15:35:04	econhedge I do not see raw SA procedures as part of the GDPNow process in their spreadsheet. Maybe I'm wrong tho.

georgepearkes	718457999031971841	2016-04-08T15:18:29	bmiller22 they don't though? why would you pay for a GDP estimate that willfully ignores data that has been released?
