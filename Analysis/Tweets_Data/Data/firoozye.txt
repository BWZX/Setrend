firoozye	688487826636324866	2016-01-16T22:27:44	thalesians probability isn't big enough to handle uncertain outcomes which are now so common. Imprecise probability only way to go.
firoozye	688485574840311808	2016-01-16T22:18:47	thalesians Simplifying assumptions in risk models mean there are many other preparations risk mgrs should make when the models fail.
firoozye	688485005958496256	2016-01-16T22:16:31	thalesians Novo Banco is another case where uncertainty means CDS bid-ask should widen. A hedge is no longer a hedge.
