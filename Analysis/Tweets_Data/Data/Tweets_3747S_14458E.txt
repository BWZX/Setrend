3747S_14458E	689650327214120961	2016-01-20T03:27:05	georgepearkes Exactly. But read their investor presentations when you have a moment. They just spell it out - a cyclical business.
3747S_14458E	689649322485510144	2016-01-20T03:23:06	georgepearkes No need to wonder. They are very transparent but, as usual, TL; DR
3747S_14458E	689639085409959937	2016-01-20T02:42:25	AbeLolisted georgepearkes I think so. Asset managers who get set late 2016, early 2017 will be paid handsomely for doing not much.
