byjoelanderson	719190340624723969	2016-04-10T15:48:33	ramsincanon and i'm sure we'll revisit it again tonight.
byjoelanderson	719190023988318210	2016-04-10T15:47:18	tressiemcphd oh man. I def remember Mo Collins. And yeah, it's surreal to lose one to natural causes. It gets you all in your feelings
byjoelanderson	719189771256332293	2016-04-10T15:46:18	steenfox i see you, tho.

byjoelanderson	719189617484763136	2016-04-10T15:45:41	nffc65 thanks, homie. Appreciate that very much.
byjoelanderson	719189472244408322	2016-04-10T15:45:06	Since I brought it up: Shouts to my boy J Swift. One of the original Mo City greats. 
byjoelanderson	719188204184731648	2016-04-10T15:40:04	staceyNYCDC thanks, stacey. Really appreciate that. I'mma be aight, tho.
byjoelanderson	719188070482882563	2016-04-10T15:39:32	scATX Thanks, Jessica! I'm alright but it's just had me doing a little to a lot of thinking.
byjoelanderson	719187880539631616	2016-04-10T15:38:47	steenfox don't. Lol
byjoelanderson	719187338102898688	2016-04-10T15:36:37	Ngongang thanks, homie. I'm good, but it's just a little surreal to lose someone from *that* already. Gave me a lot to think about.
byjoelanderson	719187185249857537	2016-04-10T15:36:01	johnedwinmason say word. going to the doctor is a good start. I'm trying to nip all my bad habits in the bud now, just to be safe.
byjoelanderson	719186896820129792	2016-04-10T15:34:52	reetamac thanks, syreeta. really appreciate that. it sucks, but like I say, my old friends are rallying and it's been great to see.
byjoelanderson	719186739642826752	2016-04-10T15:34:15	yssd Jag_Me_Out i went to St. Louis in, like, '89 and I remember being terrified by all the gang-related graffiti and shit. I never knew
byjoelanderson	719186375375847424	2016-04-10T15:32:48	tmwinsett thanks much. really appreciate that.
byjoelanderson	719186302076227588	2016-04-10T15:32:30	ramsincanon thanks, fam. on the bright side: my moms went to the funeral and gave me painstaking detail of all the dramatic subtext.
byjoelanderson	719186115425476610	2016-04-10T15:31:46	johnedwinmason yeah, man. thanks much. we gotta get our health right, for real.
byjoelanderson	719185404679749632	2016-04-10T15:28:56	pink_funk lol. i tried, tho.
byjoelanderson	719185277151907840	2016-04-10T15:28:26	tressiemcphd awww, thanks. if anything not-bad has come of it, it's that a bunch of us from that time are reconnecting and what-not.
byjoelanderson	719184973580734465	2016-04-10T15:27:14	It's not like we grew up in the hood. We just grew up in a middle class black suburb of Houston. You never felt like you couldnt get touched
byjoelanderson	719184693694849024	2016-04-10T15:26:07	That we made it to adulthood wasn't something we ever took for granted. Not when everything seemed so damn dangerous as teenagers.
byjoelanderson	719184512136024064	2016-04-10T15:25:24	Maybe I'm all wistful this morning because one of my childhood friends, an old track teammate, died of a heart attack earlier this week.
byjoelanderson	719184025286352896	2016-04-10T15:23:28	cbenjaminrucker those Hornets jackets were so clean. but yeah. If you were out in public with it, you never know if it might be a problem
byjoelanderson	719183457679732736	2016-04-10T15:21:12	byjoelanderson my grandma returned the Charlotte Hornets Starter jacket she got me for Christmas because she thought I'd get shot over it 😞
byjoelanderson	719182644060119041	2016-04-10T15:17:58	For real. Learn something about the '90s, y'all.  
byjoelanderson	719182293898625024	2016-04-10T15:16:35	reetamac i mean, i don't doubt you at all. And you ended up being right. But at the time, I mostly just remember people being scared.
byjoelanderson	719182001660497920	2016-04-10T15:15:25	Lol. It's weird but that song, in a lot of ways, was pretty incisive social commentary.  
byjoelanderson	719181645157261312	2016-04-10T15:14:00	"What size shoes are those, cuz?" Yup, I saw it happen.  
byjoelanderson	719181493017251841	2016-04-10T15:13:24	mopatton_sports JayScottSmith yup. the fear was real.
byjoelanderson	719180970453114880	2016-04-10T15:11:19	tmwinsett off murworth? man, my mother begged me to never go to the Soundwaves over there during that time. So I know of what you speak
byjoelanderson	719180629946925056	2016-04-10T15:09:58	It's so weird. My mother bought me a silver Raiders jacket and a Bulls jacket. But never let me wear them anywhere  
byjoelanderson	719180128404656128	2016-04-10T15:07:58	How in the hell did I end up here?
byjoelanderson	719179432267616256	2016-04-10T15:05:13	At times, it really did feel like we were hurtling toward some sort of dystopian nightmare. Like, go watch "Banging in Little Rock."
byjoelanderson	719178928137502720	2016-04-10T15:03:12	So while everyone gets to look smart about mass incarceration in hindsight today, it's important to remember what those days were like.
byjoelanderson	719178715989565440	2016-04-10T15:02:22	She was horrified someone might come and take away, in only a few seconds, all the effort she and my father poured into me.
byjoelanderson	719178209296691201	2016-04-10T15:00:21	I'm not getting into Dem primary talk, but all that to say: black folks were scared too during that time. My mom wanted everyone in jail.
byjoelanderson	719176323688599553	2016-04-10T14:52:51	Wearing the wrong-colored jacket. Going to a certain mall. Going to any night club. Having my necklace out. Anything could've gotten me shot
byjoelanderson	719175694501040128	2016-04-10T14:50:21	But in the '90s, back when folks believed in things like "superpredators," my mother actually believed I might get shot for anything.
byjoelanderson	719175451063619585	2016-04-10T14:49:23	shoshpd it's so very sobering
byjoelanderson	719174741899083776	2016-04-10T14:46:34	I have a tweet I want to tweet so bad but I can't go there on this again. So, let me pray for the strength to walk away from this tweet.
byjoelanderson	719173437776797696	2016-04-10T14:41:23	In the 90s, when I was growing up in Houston, my mother begged me to never honk at anyone while driving after a spate of road rage shootings
byjoelanderson	719173256893206528	2016-04-10T14:40:40	The story of Will Smith's (the New Orleans Saint DE, not the actor) shooting death is terrifying. 
byjoelanderson	719172275707097088	2016-04-10T14:36:46	samesfandiari MrKMunroe the bulls didn't really start getting that sort of credit until they'd built a nearly unprecedented resume.
byjoelanderson	719172037940371456	2016-04-10T14:35:50	samesfandiari MrKMunroe that might be true, but consider that by the time we saw Bulls win 72, they'd already won 3 titles.
byjoelanderson	719169399240822784	2016-04-10T14:25:20	samesfandiari MrKMunroe agreed. And to the point of expansion teams, still, none of them were worse than the 76ers are now.
byjoelanderson	719168049593454592	2016-04-10T14:19:59	I mean, they basically wrote what they meant. Heh.  
byjoelanderson	719037832619106304	2016-04-10T05:42:33	Oh my God 
byjoelanderson	719003568238268422	2016-04-10T03:26:23	_JesseJordan yes. I saiiiiid "believe it"
byjoelanderson	719001725273640960	2016-04-10T03:19:04	SwitchGlitchmon stop it. Hakeem would've torched Perdue/Wennington. And Mad Max would've had MJ on lock
byjoelanderson	719001479986548736	2016-04-10T03:18:05	lemonverbena_ y'all were a bad matchup and my Rockets were tired from winning two straight chips. Seattle would make that trade too
byjoelanderson	719001237954252804	2016-04-10T03:17:08	RamonFebus it's true, tho
byjoelanderson	718997730345881600	2016-04-10T03:03:11	My Rockets still woulda kicked the Bulls' asses in the Finals, tho. Believe dat.
byjoelanderson	718992282238771201	2016-04-10T02:41:32	hbryant42 byjoelanderson two of the five greatest single-season teams of all-time, w/ 67 PHI, 86 BOS, 16 GSW.
byjoelanderson	718991413195571200	2016-04-10T02:38:05	What's actually kinda amazing about those '90s Bulls teams, is that the year after they won 72, they won 69.
byjoelanderson	718989497044570112	2016-04-10T02:30:28	You've lived long enough to see Lance Stephenson Heroball. Be grateful.

byjoelanderson	718948857015447552	2016-04-09T23:48:59	goldietaylor he really did me a favor. I'm firmly down this '90s R&amp;B-hip hop wormhole now. lol.
byjoelanderson	718948361508823040	2016-04-09T23:47:01	CJStarchild called him the "ear-biter" and the whole nine. That wasn't the best allegiance at the time, for real.
byjoelanderson	718948044276797440	2016-04-09T23:45:45	I was such a big Canibus fan that I never realized how goofy he looked running on the beach with Mike Tyson. 
byjoelanderson	718947367571984384	2016-04-09T23:43:04	illtelligent lol. i mean, can't pretend I'm afraid of someone who ain't in my weight class.

byjoelanderson	718942423687102465	2016-04-09T23:23:25	I loved that Made Men joint with the Lox on the Belly soundtrack. I don't want beef with Ray like this.

byjoelanderson	718922602169774085	2016-04-09T22:04:39	mikefinger heh. But I'm sure that would never happen at a fine institute like Tennessee
byjoelanderson	718914656639660032	2016-04-09T21:33:05	Ain't no way Georgia didn't pay to get Dominique Wilkins down there.  … Oh wait. They're talking about that now.

byjoelanderson	718901086224928768	2016-04-09T20:39:10	dweinman22 absolutely. Playing defense in a team scheme requires a lot more than athleticism and dunking ability. But people forget that

byjoelanderson	718900422635720704	2016-04-09T20:36:31	Smooth_Orator right. And it ain't like they're dunking their way to victory. These dudes are wildly talented: one cat has 7 3s today
byjoelanderson	718899761873444864	2016-04-09T20:33:54	The youth US national team is beating the brakes off an all-star team of international players now. The game isn't even competitive.

byjoelanderson	718865484108554240	2016-04-09T18:17:41	It was, like, "wow, they all know each other?" It felt like black history, like those portraits you see of Martin, Malcolm and Mandela.
byjoelanderson	718865198354837505	2016-04-09T18:16:33	TI having Michael Vick in the "Rubberband Man" video was like when New Edition had Malcolm Jamal Warner in the "NE Heartbreak" video.

byjoelanderson	718857592768827392	2016-04-09T17:46:20	TeritaTweets NyashaJunior Harlem and then one on, like, W 19th St. They were mostly just difficult to get to for me.
byjoelanderson	718857391379324928	2016-04-09T17:45:32	TeritaTweets lease is up June 30. But I'd be willing to stay a few more months just to squeeze in more time there.
byjoelanderson	718857212999798784	2016-04-09T17:44:49	NyashaJunior TeritaTweets I tried a couple of boxes in NY but I didn't like them nearly as much as this one. I've found wild variance
byjoelanderson	718856482062622722	2016-04-09T17:41:55	TeritaTweets it's def one of my favorite workouts I've ever done. I'd consider not moving for awhile so I could keep working out there.
byjoelanderson	718855332785557504	2016-04-09T17:37:21	Karnythia lol. run for the school board. But maybe for real, tho

byjoelanderson	718852432059432960	2016-04-09T17:25:50	I can only imagine. Like I was saying, I didn't realize it at the time but my parents were ALWAYS up at the school  
byjoelanderson	718851888217632768	2016-04-09T17:23:40	It's also why I'm skeptical of the idea that charter or private schools are better for black children. Most see us as a problem anyway
byjoelanderson	718851437719998466	2016-04-09T17:21:53	PratherLab Alia_McC I think that's the especially daunting part. You can never trust the school, no matter where it is or who's in charge
byjoelanderson	718831238912544768	2016-04-09T16:01:37	Alia_McC byjoelanderson exactly. I think we found the best option. But it's really about choosing which problems you'll have.
byjoelanderson	718830920904654849	2016-04-09T16:00:21	byjoelanderson PratherLab...But knowing that the tradeoff was fewer kids who looked like us. Now we're facing the same choice. It's hard.

byjoelanderson	718850291097935872	2016-04-09T17:17:19	"Baby," jdesmondharris says as we're getting out of the car. "Your legs are ashy." It's unnecessary to lotion up for a workout, eh?
byjoelanderson	718849972368580608	2016-04-09T17:16:03	Sorry I missed a lot of tweets. Just got back from CrossFit. *flexes*
byjoelanderson	718829800727511040	2016-04-09T15:55:54	Alia_McC PratherLab my parents were up at school ALL the time. It never occurred to me until years later that they were advocating for me
byjoelanderson	718828139410034688	2016-04-09T15:49:18	byjoelanderson PratherLab We just started, too. And the options are dismal. Really makes me appreciate my parents that much more.
byjoelanderson	718827461690023936	2016-04-09T15:46:36	Agree. We had to push school to test our kid, 1st response was no open seats; so I offered to buy school desk/chair! 
byjoelanderson	718826990405427204	2016-04-09T15:44:44	Oh yeah. That's other part of this. If even gifted kids are thwarted, imagine what it's like w/kids w/special needs 
byjoelanderson	718825176771592193	2016-04-09T15:37:31	JVARGAS82 yeah, mentorship is key. My worry with society's obsessive focus on high-achieving kids is, well, what about those who aren't?
byjoelanderson	718824689552887808	2016-04-09T15:35:35	tressiemcphd listen: it frustrates the hell out of me just hearing about it. God knows what'll be like if/when I have kids.
byjoelanderson	718824155471187970	2016-04-09T15:33:28	And, hell, even students who aren't "gifted" deserve a quality education.
byjoelanderson	718823828017717249	2016-04-09T15:32:10	I believe it. Sounds basically like every story I've heard from every black parent able to be engaged in process  
byjoelanderson	718823572441989124	2016-04-09T15:31:09	That's a great point. Studies show black teachers are much better at identifying &amp; nurturing gifted black students.

byjoelanderson	718821710527508480	2016-04-09T15:23:45	They've got to be on guard for things that most other parents never even have to consider. It just seems tiring and daunting.
byjoelanderson	718821441169264641	2016-04-09T15:22:41	Their is no "good" school that can help them avoid this. Because even there, they might have to deal with educators w/lessened expectations
byjoelanderson	718821192010899457	2016-04-09T15:21:41	Black parents just have this tremendous challenge in ushering their kids thru school to get a decent education no matter the circumstances
byjoelanderson	718820886191603712	2016-04-09T15:20:28	It doesn't matter whether rich or working-class, whether in Houston or NY or Shreveport, whether good school or a "poor-performing" school
byjoelanderson	718820342899150848	2016-04-09T15:18:19	What's been especially jarring for me is watching friends try to navigate the educational system with their kids...

byjoelanderson	709238607442108416	2016-03-14T04:43:55	Kinda curious to know how many other folks - people with far fewer resources - Nifong railroaded during his time as DA?

byjoelanderson	706542205687566336	2016-03-06T18:09:23	I'm pretty certain that the best anti-drug song of my lifetime was "Say No Go."  Or maybe "Water."

byjoelanderson	706541333901520897	2016-03-06T18:05:55	"New Jack City" was ostensibly an anti-drug movie but, in a bit of sloppy storytelling, the only cool person in the movie was Nino Brown.
byjoelanderson	706540834104061954	2016-03-06T18:03:56	Be honest: only uncool people were telling us to not use drugs in the '80s. I'm not saying they were wrong. I'm saying they weren't cool
byjoelanderson	706539925567467524	2016-03-06T18:00:19	You can tell the '80s were fun because they had to keep telling people to stop using drugs.

byjoelanderson	704120501237469184	2016-02-29T01:46:24	The degree of difficulty for that monologue was basically Richard Pryor and he came through with a solid Martin Lawrence in the early '90s
byjoelanderson	704119324567478272	2016-02-29T01:41:43	Whew, he's making it uncomfortable for folks, which is about as good of a job as you could expect.

byjoelanderson	703974683704582146	2016-02-28T16:06:58	More than media personalities and academics, nerdland especially made room for people who almost never get a platform for their work.
byjoelanderson	703974383371431936	2016-02-28T16:05:46	Often, nerdland had on guests who worked min-wage jobs, folks who ran struggling non-profits, community activists, etc. Who else does that?

byjoelanderson	701211580592033792	2016-02-21T01:07:23	It's uncomfortable and shit. It makes me worry for the future of any kids I'd want to have someday. But denying it is foolhardy
byjoelanderson	701211365654941702	2016-02-21T01:06:32	I don't want to fight in my mentions. But the reason pundits underestimated Trump is because they don't want to grapple w/who we really are

byjoelanderson	701209275478069248	2016-02-21T00:58:13	AmandaTintero yeah, but it's the same deal in sports with prognosticators too.
byjoelanderson	701209044556451841	2016-02-21T00:57:18	BenMathisLilley yeah, but you know how I feel about this. it was always in realm of possibility, though Jeb! being so bad certainly helped

byjoelanderson	701207564218798080	2016-02-21T00:51:25	I really feel like all of the pundits that downplayed Trump's chances of being a serious presidential contender should have to sit 2016 out.

byjoelanderson	701206990089924608	2016-02-21T00:49:08	This is the state Trump won, though let's not fool ourselves, he's poised to win others.

byjoelanderson	701167450126045184	2016-02-20T22:12:01	ArchCityDefense true. I also think it's a larger societal failing we just aren't equipped to handle &amp; have never really gotten right

byjoelanderson	701156267922882560	2016-02-20T21:27:35	bradisterrific And before him, it was likely Randy Moss and/or Jason Williams (though I'm not sure the latter was a 5-star).

byjoelanderson	701155430857244672	2016-02-20T21:24:16	@CapricornKing_ oh yeah. def remember Pittsnogle. He was a latter-day Matt Bullard.
byjoelanderson	701155269137399808	2016-02-20T21:23:37	Well, w/K-State, I truly believe Bill Snyder has done the best coaching job in recent major college football history 
byjoelanderson	701155065684324352	2016-02-20T21:22:49	bradisterrific I really don't understand how they get elite athletes to go to school there, in both football and basketball.
byjoelanderson	701154509309894656	2016-02-20T21:20:36	In my lifetime, I don't think there's been a college athletic program that has done more with less than West Virginia.

byjoelanderson	701130406490296321	2016-02-20T19:44:49	Trump isn't playing to anyone's fear. He's simply a suitcase-faced vessel for their ingrained impulse to hate brown folks.
byjoelanderson	701129887889788928	2016-02-20T19:42:46	Which is to say: when Trump is gone from public, we'll still have to deal with all the folks that lifted him to political prominence.

byjoelanderson	701114261192310784	2016-02-20T18:40:40	ProfHartley vulnerablepops ProPublica but a fairly surprising percentage - to me, at least - lived outside of the *state*
byjoelanderson	701113914314985472	2016-02-20T18:39:17	ProfHartley vulnerablepops ProPublica I think it was county, not city. Which is pretty damning. But lemme scrounge for those notes
byjoelanderson	701113497476681728	2016-02-20T18:37:38	ProfHartley vulnerablepops ProPublica I *think* I have this right, but most-recent data showed only 21% of officers live in Baltimore Co.
