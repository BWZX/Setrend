chrisgeidner	723610454447280128	2016-04-22T20:32:31	Does he think the North Carolina restroom law isn't a real law? Or what? Like, I get the sentiment. But, he's the president.
chrisgeidner	723610177543503877	2016-04-22T20:31:25	I mean, presumably the statement is directed to LGBT people in the UK, as that was the point of the travel advisory. How can Obama say that?
chrisgeidner	723609697924833280	2016-04-22T20:29:30	It seems to me that Obama went beyond what he can actually guarantee there‚Äîand by quite a bit. How can he say this? 
chrisgeidner	723609124160811008	2016-04-22T20:27:13	But, I'd like to look at the other part ‚Äî the bulk of the statement ‚Äî which is in response to the UK travel warning about the laws.
chrisgeidner	723608794996023297	2016-04-22T20:25:55	Got it, and that's in fitting with what one would expect from the Obama administration and the president given past statements.
chrisgeidner	723608586790776832	2016-04-22T20:25:05	The big, initial takeaway was that Obama said he "think[s] that the laws that have been passed there are wrong and should be overturned."

chrisgeidner	721850971861614592	2016-04-18T00:00:57	Excellent thread on the arguments tomorrow in the Immigration Executive Orders SCOTUS case. Start here: 
chrisgeidner	721855358554284032	2016-04-18T00:18:23	MEANWHILE: I have been WAITING for this from AdamSerwer ‚Äî&gt;  
chrisgeidner	721854947822854146	2016-04-18T00:16:45	As usual, there will be no electronics in the press gallery during the arguments, so expect the first argument reports about noon. SCOTUS
chrisgeidner	721854574630432769	2016-04-18T00:15:16	For my part, I'll be at SCOTUS in the morn for the args, which will follow orders and opinions about 10:15a for about 90 minutes.
chrisgeidner	721854404312305666	2016-04-18T00:14:36	And, that's a wrap. As noted, please go and look at all the briefs for yourself here ‚Äî¬†
chrisgeidner	721853632837218305	2016-04-18T00:11:32	The MALDEF / Jane Does reply brief echoes this "lawful presence" distinction argument: 
chrisgeidner	721853074944475138	2016-04-18T00:09:19	The Obama admin specifically argues that "lawful presence" is not the same as "lawful status." 
chrisgeidner	721852312835256320	2016-04-18T00:06:17	In its reply brief, the Obama admin counters the idea that DAPA is conferring the ~right~ to remain in the U.S.: 
chrisgeidner	721850674154237956	2016-04-17T23:59:46	Additionally, the House presses on the idea DAPA authorizes "prospective violation of the immigration laws." 
chrisgeidner	721850123312066560	2016-04-17T23:57:35	The House presses a similar point, arguing that Congress has repeatedly ~refused~ to do what admin did with DAPA: 
chrisgeidner	721849102649200643	2016-04-17T23:53:32	States' main argument, reiterated throughout, is that admin attempts to turn unlawful conduct into lawful conduct. 
chrisgeidner	721848710083264512	2016-04-17T23:51:58	The states' brief argues in favor of standing, but also sounds indignant note about admin's standing opposition: 
chrisgeidner	721847456833662976	2016-04-17T23:46:59	The MALDEF brief details other programs that it could see subject to challenge if Texas' standing arg succeeds here: 
chrisgeidner	721846943195013125	2016-04-17T23:44:57	The MALDEF brief, representing Jane Does who could benefit from DAPA, frames itself as follows: 
chrisgeidner	721846586658136064	2016-04-17T23:43:32	On the Take Care arg, the Obama administration brushes it aside, for the most part ‚Äî citing JUDGE BORK at one point: 
chrisgeidner	721846084826480640	2016-04-17T23:41:32	(4) in violation of the Constitution's "Take Care Clause," which is a fun constitutional detour in the case if you're a big dork like me.
chrisgeidner	721845737601044481	2016-04-17T23:40:09	If so, (2) is the policy "arbitrary and capricious" (i.e., contrary to law); (3) subject to notice-and-comment rules; or ...
chrisgeidner	721845110317719552	2016-04-17T23:37:40	The arguments come down to 4 questions: (1) Do the states have standing to challenge the Obama admin's 2014 DAPA policy guidance?
chrisgeidner	721844704359366656	2016-04-17T23:36:03	Back to the briefs. Notably, the Obama administration brags about how many undocumented people it has removed: 
chrisgeidner	721844335491358721	2016-04-17T23:34:35	Of course, the details get much more complicated, so feel free to peruse the briefs at SCOTUSblog here: 
chrisgeidner	721843930736816128	2016-04-17T23:32:58	The states' argument, led by Texas, is summed up ~very~ succinctly here: 
chrisgeidner	721843704735088642	2016-04-17T23:32:05	The Obama administration argument is summed up as follows: 
chrisgeidner	721843519271399424	2016-04-17T23:31:20	I'm going to highlight some of the briefs from those parties now!
chrisgeidner	721842836455428097	2016-04-17T23:28:38	The arguments will be 90 minutes, with FOUR different sides represented: Obama admin, MALDEF lawyer for immigrants, Texas/states, House.
chrisgeidner	721842425963147264	2016-04-17T23:27:00	Phew, so. Tomorrow @ SCOTUS is the immigration executive action oral arguments!

chrisgeidner	721127360540618752	2016-04-16T00:05:35	jawillick I say he cited positively from Thomas' dissent, which he did, and I LINKED TO THE DAMN ARTICLE. And, I spent an hour explaining.
chrisgeidner	721126000852090882	2016-04-16T00:00:11	jlp858 I don't think talking about, having, or using a dildo makes one "a ridiculous pervert." Au contraire!

chrisgeidner	721125678159171584	2016-04-15T23:58:54	jlp858 And that is what his SG brief argued ‚Äî but is what he's trying to avoid saying now ‚Äî but is what the Thomas quote winks toward.
chrisgeidner	721125438093946880	2016-04-15T23:57:56	jlp858 Assuming so, then he likely thinks such bans are constitutional, right?
chrisgeidner	721124598792777729	2016-04-15T23:54:36	KDbyProxy No, it's the reverse for me. I only did anything about this once the campaign cited to Thomas' Lawrence dissent.
chrisgeidner	721124339521875969	2016-04-15T23:53:35	jawillick Also, if you follow the thread, it's not misleading at all. Thomas was dissenting. He was saying sodomy bans were constitutional.

chrisgeidner	721122370740756480	2016-04-15T23:45:45	KDbyProxy I am not doing so, as I detail in the thread.
chrisgeidner	721122160866144256	2016-04-15T23:44:55	jawillick Um. Read the thread. I go through the whole thing.
chrisgeidner	721122004250832896	2016-04-15T23:44:18	I know this seems like a side issue of a side issue of a side issue. But it is rly about Cruz' view of substantive due process protections.
chrisgeidner	721121406105296896	2016-04-15T23:41:55	Seems, at that point, clearly worth asking whether he personally agrees w his brief, which wasn't about policy/was about constitutionality.
chrisgeidner	721121100801929216	2016-04-15T23:40:42	Cruz states a policy preference against dildo bans, as his campaign highlights Thomas saying a policy pref =/= a constitutional decision.
chrisgeidner	721120521249812481	2016-04-15T23:38:24	But, today, the reason I decided to pipe up ‚Äî¬†and raise questions to the campaign ‚Äî¬†is that their answers seem disingenuous.
chrisgeidner	721120331889524736	2016-04-15T23:37:39	Specifically, I think it is worth asking whether he personally believes certain args advanced as SG when they match w his positions now.
chrisgeidner	721120087311269888	2016-04-15T23:36:41	Insofar as work Cruz did as SG is echoed by his stated positions as a lawmaker or would-be executive, though, they are relevant.
chrisgeidner	721119736675831809	2016-04-15T23:35:17	And, I would note: I wrote nothing about this based on the brief itself because I am uncomfortable imputing his SG briefs to him personally.
chrisgeidner	721118994896445440	2016-04-15T23:32:20	Also, re: Cruz today: A federal ban on dildos is different than a state ban, obviously.*   * = I really can't believe I wrote that sentence.

chrisgeidner	721115339665358848	2016-04-15T23:17:49	marcyjcook Dissenting opinion. He lost.
chrisgeidner	721115194676666370	2016-04-15T23:17:14	Q isn't if Cruz would ban dildos ‚Äî¬†fwiw, he said he wouldn't:  ‚Äî it's whether he thinks a ban is unconstitutional.
chrisgeidner	721114782301102080	2016-04-15T23:15:36	By citing to Thomas' dissent they're not distancing themselves from the brief, as AP claims; the brief wasn't arguing it's good policy.

chrisgeidner	714815630277382146	2016-03-29T14:05:01	After arguments, the case had appeared to be headed for a 5-4 end to those union fees for non-members of public unions. Now, a 4-4 tie.
chrisgeidner	714815163229048832	2016-03-29T14:03:10	Today's SCOTUS decision leaves in place the 9th Circuit ruling that ALLOWS union "agency fees" for non-members to continue.
chrisgeidner	714814875617243136	2016-03-29T14:02:01	BREAKING: SCOTUS holds that Friedrichs, the public unions case, is "affirmed by an equally divided court." A 4-4 tie.
chrisgeidner	714809702673031168	2016-03-29T13:41:28	I'd say this is the type front page the White House wants (the right side, you snarky folks):

chrisgeidner	714806118132936704	2016-03-29T13:27:13	Accordingly, today's SCOTUS line is around the south side of the building.

chrisgeidner	714802311072194565	2016-03-29T13:12:06	joeyhunziker gabrielmalor Not actually! There are &amp; have been great reasons for RFRAs. Why it was bipartisan when passed.
chrisgeidner	714801534199066624	2016-03-29T13:09:00	joeyhunziker gabrielmalor ... because they want to take some step to show their support for opponents of marriage equality.
chrisgeidner	714801258004090880	2016-03-29T13:07:54	joeyhunziker gabrielmalor Now, one of the problems here is intent, &amp;, it does appear that states are ~now~ passing &amp; expanding on them ...
chrisgeidner	714800948019929088	2016-03-29T13:06:41	joeyhunziker gabrielmalor And some states didn't pass a RFRA back then (or before).
chrisgeidner	714800838607257600	2016-03-29T13:06:14	joeyhunziker gabrielmalor The laws have been around for that long. However, the federal one doesn't apply to states under a 1997 case.

chrisgeidner	714481193543208960	2016-03-28T15:56:05	Another possibility, considered by the Chief, was reversal w resolution that CRST was prevailing party &amp; dist ct to re-consider fees.
chrisgeidner	714480705741434880	2016-03-28T15:54:09	It seemed best-case scenario for EEOC would be a reversal with instructions to consider how a proper "prevailing party" rule is applied.
chrisgeidner	714480002490875904	2016-03-28T15:51:21	At times, Justices Kennedy &amp; Sotomayor were skeptical as well, and Justice Thomas also, likely, is skeptical (though he asked no questions).
chrisgeidner	714479708780494848	2016-03-28T15:50:11	The Chief Justice and Justices Alito &amp; Breyer were extremely skeptical in their questions about the EEOC's arguments.
chrisgeidner	714479367842344960	2016-03-28T15:48:50	Neither side likes 8th Circuit's rule; dispute at SCOTUS focused on whether EEOC's case against CRST was dismissed "with prejudice" or not.
chrisgeidner	714478357732270081	2016-03-28T15:44:49	The arguments surround procedural rules and questions about when a defendant can be considered a "prevailing party" in EEOC litigation.
chrisgeidner	714477868974268416	2016-03-28T15:42:52	The appeal from the 8th Circuit involves the rare situation where neither side argues that reasoning of the lower court should be upheld.

chrisgeidner	714159777631309824	2016-03-27T18:38:54	pnuts_mama Yeah, so, this guy uses casual sexism to dismiss women while ignoring an actual discussion of how sexism would play into it.
chrisgeidner	714159245227327488	2016-03-27T18:36:47	pnuts_mama It wouldn't be a thing about whether 2 women "double down" on Trump's sexism, it would be a fear about their own voters' sexism.
chrisgeidner	714159003689992193	2016-03-27T18:35:49	pnuts_mama I know ~you~ would. But I'm talking about the reason Dems wouldn't put two women on the ticket.
chrisgeidner	714158268080340992	2016-03-27T18:32:54	pnuts_mama Well, follow my thread. I mean, the reason not to put two women on the ticket is a fear people couldn't ~handle~ it, right?
chrisgeidner	714157575261003776	2016-03-27T18:30:09	(And what it's actually about is a much more difficult discussion about how restrictive the options for female politicians still are today.)
chrisgeidner	714157126277591041	2016-03-27T18:28:21	That would put the discussion on what it actually is about, as opposed to diminishing the role of female senators to their gender.
chrisgeidner	714156597644230656	2016-03-27T18:26:15	Yes, there might be arguments for increasing the diversity of the ticket by having a male VP, but say that, have that discussion.
chrisgeidner	714156259663093761	2016-03-27T18:24:55	While talking about Trump's sexism, it implies that the ~only~ thing those senators would bring to the ticket is their sex.
