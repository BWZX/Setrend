KellyAyotte	720632165684396033	2016-04-14T15:17:51	Let's put this authority into law so that those who break the law don't get bonuses. I'm urging the Senate today to take up &amp; pass my bill.
KellyAyotte	720631796145266689	2016-04-14T15:16:23	Amazingly, VA Sec doesn’t have authority to claw back bonuses, even if—as with the wait lists—their misconduct led to a bigger bonus check.
KellyAyotte	720631645905240065	2016-04-14T15:15:47	I intro'd bipartisan legislation to require the VA Sec to claw back bonuses paid to employees involved in serious misconduct or felonies.
KellyAyotte	720631390648320000	2016-04-14T15:14:46	A common theme in all these VA scandals—those committing misconduct are getting bonuses - aka getting checks paid by the America taxpayer.
KellyAyotte	720631135798169601	2016-04-14T15:13:46	But length of time veterans wait is one of the ways bonuses for hospital officials were determined.
KellyAyotte	720631029141254144	2016-04-14T15:13:20	Unfortunately, one of those cases was in NH. They tried to keep numbers down on the length of time vets waited 4 appts.
KellyAyotte	720630243032199169	2016-04-14T15:10:13	The VA inspector general investigated 73 VA facilities across the country and found scheduling problems in 51 of them.

KellyAyotte	720005672973299712	2016-04-12T21:48:24	After hearing fr stakeholders, we updated GAP Act this week to protect salary transparency &amp; employees’ right to discuss
KellyAyotte	720005184957583362	2016-04-12T21:46:27	GAP Act prohibits retaliation against employees who discuss their pay &amp; tells employers they can’t institute pay secrecy policies
KellyAyotte	720005017189629954	2016-04-12T21:45:47	GAP Act is a sensible approach to update, clarify and strengthen these laws
KellyAyotte	720004953775939585	2016-04-12T21:45:32	Unfortunately, there are a patchwork of laws &amp; differing court opinions tht govern employees’ ability to discuss pay w/o retaliation
KellyAyotte	720004816982974464	2016-04-12T21:45:00	GAP Act makes clear that employers must pay men &amp; women equal wages for equal work w/o reducing merit pay
KellyAyotte	720004694278545408	2016-04-12T21:44:30	GAP Act builds on NH’s highly successful bipartisan pay equity law – Men &amp; women shld receive equalpayforequalwork
KellyAyotte	720004568629841922	2016-04-12T21:44:00	In NH, more than half of the women are the primary or co-earners in their households. We need to address this problem
KellyAyotte	720004509217501184	2016-04-12T21:43:46	Let me be clear – no woman, mother, sister, daughter should ever have to face gender-based pay discrimination in the work place

KellyAyotte	719988503849742340	2016-04-12T20:40:10	Respecting women is an issue that Rs&amp;Ds can agree on. We share common ground in wanting to fight pay discrimination 
KellyAyotte	719983457116364806	2016-04-12T20:20:07	Salary transparency is key in this fight. GAP Act protects employees' ability to talk abt pay &amp; tells employers they can't sidestep that.
KellyAyotte	719982211932360704	2016-04-12T20:15:10	The GAP Act takes a sensible approach to strengthening equal pay laws and addressing pay discrimination  EqualPayDay
