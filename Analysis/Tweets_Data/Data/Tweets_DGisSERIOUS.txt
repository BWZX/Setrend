DGisSERIOUS	724351943188058114	2016-04-24T21:38:55	And Assad's crimes are 'exaggerated.' Imagine being told that - as a Syrian who's lost friends or family to the regime, as so many have.
DGisSERIOUS	724349911609815041	2016-04-24T21:30:51	In this narrative, Syrians have no agency. They're always 'western proxies' - tools of imperialism who can't make decisions for themselves.
DGisSERIOUS	724348828342738945	2016-04-24T21:26:33	This is why so many Syrians have been critical of much of the western left's response. They've been treated like pawns, not people.
DGisSERIOUS	724347664175869952	2016-04-24T21:21:55	The message that sends is that Syrians don't matter, except in terms of their role in either fighting or supporting western imperialism.
DGisSERIOUS	724347098544640000	2016-04-24T21:19:40	Imagine hearing that as a Syrian. You rise up against your oppressor and get told that it was never about you. It was about us, the West.
DGisSERIOUS	724346565259866117	2016-04-24T21:17:33	They lecture Syrians about *their* revolution, condescendingly explaining that it was orchestrated by the West and Syrians were just pawns.
DGisSERIOUS	724345331106848772	2016-04-24T21:12:39	Leftists are supposed to listen to oppressed people &amp; show solidarity. Yet on Syria, many ignore &amp; speak over Syrians suffering under Assad.
DGisSERIOUS	724338742534803456	2016-04-24T20:46:28	They seem to think that a lot of criticism of Assad is 'western propaganda', when those same criticisms have been made by Syrians for years.

DGisSERIOUS	707404826100023296	2016-03-09T03:17:08	LibyaLiberty and you're right. I should say not why ALL of them are voting for him. There's def a good amount voting solely based on that
DGisSERIOUS	707404188733607936	2016-03-09T03:14:36	Tequila0341 LibyaLiberty that, I totally agree with.
DGisSERIOUS	707404104293814272	2016-03-09T03:14:16	Tequila0341 LibyaLiberty I don't have polling numbers to dispute that but if you read the article has some interesting stats
DGisSERIOUS	707403714512949253	2016-03-09T03:12:43	LibyaLiberty but I should be clear. 100% of his voters, at the VERY least, don't mind the racism and islamophobia.
DGisSERIOUS	707403555020394497	2016-03-09T03:12:05	LibyaLiberty I think he blames DC politicians more for selling out the middle/working class. Minorities get lumped in after.

DGisSERIOUS	707401265681141767	2016-03-09T03:02:59	pauldebenedetto I disagree. Trump way more vocal about shitty trade deals, lobbyists, $$$ in politics than racist policies.
DGisSERIOUS	707400915549032449	2016-03-09T03:01:35	Bookwormly his main scapegoat is bought and paid for politicians/DC industrial complex and China more than immigrants, Muslims.

DGisSERIOUS	707398703049523204	2016-03-09T02:52:48	Bookwormly agreed. Again, not denying that but point is that it's not main thing that's winning people over@
DGisSERIOUS	707398428066717696	2016-03-09T02:51:42	But the only way to defeat this thing is to understand why it's grown so much, and that article nails it.

DGisSERIOUS	707396935620104192	2016-03-09T02:45:46	Which, again, dude says horrible things and has atrocious policies I hate, but the point is those aren't his main selling point to voters
DGisSERIOUS	707396648377393152	2016-03-09T02:44:38	But that's what people don't want to talk about bc it makes for hotter takes to say the 4th Reich is forming &amp; it's always been Amerikkka
DGisSERIOUS	707395808736497664	2016-03-09T02:41:18	Which isn't to say that he's not racist. Or that many of his supporters aren't racist. But it's not WHY people are voting for him.
