marykissel	707762323713335297	2016-03-10T02:57:42	Bernie should demand Hillary release the 30,000+ emails she tried to delete from her private email server, not her Wall Street speeches.
marykissel	707761665379590144	2016-03-10T02:55:05	Both Hillary and Bernie's 'arguments' for immigration reform center around pandering to interest groups, not economic benefits.

marykissel	706991350235975680	2016-03-07T23:54:07	Tuning in late FoxNews townhall. Hillary looks composed, experienced, and is talking to a new audience. Smart to participate.
marykissel	706674535429492736	2016-03-07T02:55:13	Hillary dodges question about email scandal, talks Trump, primary vote tallies instead. Wish andersoncooper had pressed her.
marykissel	706670735415250944	2016-03-07T02:40:07	Hillary's response to the fracking question sums up Hillary: one part obfuscation, one part evasion, and two parts BS.
marykissel	706668962948497409	2016-03-07T02:33:04	Once upon a time, HillaryClinton supported charter schools. Now she's a shill for teachers unions, and proud of it. Hope and change!
marykissel	706666635839541249	2016-03-07T02:23:49	Extended discussion of racial woes. Not a word about personal responsibility, value of work &amp; intact families. Or did I miss that?

marykissel	706507126265487360	2016-03-06T15:49:59	Just remarkable to see HillaryClinton claim she's been transparent about private server. Created to evade FOIA, deleted 30,000+ emails.

marykissel	706498881144623105	2016-03-06T15:17:14	Watching Sunday morning shows. Focus on immigration is hogwash. Exit polls show only 10-15% of GOP voters prioritize the issue.

marykissel	705605058243772416	2016-03-04T04:05:30	GOPDebate wrap: Cruz emerging as strongest anti-Trump option. Trump 'flexible' on everything, no principles, hit hard. Rubio, Kasich ok.
marykissel	705601033758711808	2016-03-04T03:49:30	'Wouldn't it be nice if we could get along with Russia?' This is Trump's idea of foreign policy? Think about that.
marykissel	705599124071174145	2016-03-04T03:41:55	Cruz augments his electability pitch, arguing he'd appoint a solid conservative to Supreme Court. Vey convincing.
marykissel	705598036479778816	2016-03-04T03:37:35	ANOTHER realDonaldTrump policy flip-flop; this time, on assault weapons ban. He has no core beliefs. None. Zero.
marykissel	705597035366502400	2016-03-04T03:33:37	Nice to hear JohnKasich praise school choice. Not discussed enough in this election season.
marykissel	705595946432913411	2016-03-04T03:29:17	Yes, apologies, typo. 
marykissel	705594264152109056	2016-03-04T03:22:36	Cruz makes cogent argument that he's the best anti-Trump choice. Conservative, sober, won 5 states, beats Hillary in polls.
marykissel	705591639235039232	2016-03-04T03:12:10	Important, revealing exchange here on the Trump University scam. Goes to the core of realDonaldTrump's character and business practices.
marykissel	705590052810788866	2016-03-04T03:05:52	Trump is flailing in the face of megynkelly's recitation of his ever-changing positions. Abundantly clear that he's making it all up.
marykissel	705587566444212224	2016-03-04T02:55:59	Hard for tedcruz to spin his support for Snowden. It was disgraceful. Snowden a traitor. Full stop.
marykissel	705584739407806464	2016-03-04T02:44:45	.megynkelly asks for detail, realDonaldTrump changes his position on high-skilled workers. Again: He's making it all up as he goes along.
marykissel	705583478985908225	2016-03-04T02:39:45	So Trump will 'build a wall.' No talk of guest worker program, H1B reform, ag visas, tracking overstays, nada. No details. No depth.
marykissel	705580564565389312	2016-03-04T02:28:10	Finally. Moderator Chris Wallace eviscerates realDonaldTrump by comparing reform promises to actual figures. Trump just making things up.
marykissel	705578987909677056	2016-03-04T02:21:54	If Trump thinks currency devaluation makes a country rich, maybe he should glance at what happened to Southeast Asia in 1997-98.
marykissel	705577695367847936	2016-03-04T02:16:46	Remarkable amount of time wasted on strategic voting, polls, 'path to victory.' That won't cut it if these candidates want to beat Trump.
marykissel	705576055726338048	2016-03-04T02:10:15	.realDonaldTrump just makes sexual allusion? Did I mishear that? On a presidential debate stage???

marykissel	703065552860934144	2016-02-26T03:54:24	GOPDebate wrap: Blitzer loses. Cruz-Rubio tag team against Trump effective, but too late? Trump took big hits. Kasich blah. Goodbye, Ben.
marykissel	703061554003111936	2016-02-26T03:38:31	Rubio makes essential point about Apple: terrorist Farook didn't even own the phone, owner agreed to search! See HooverInst Epstein essay.

marykissel	703054320225394689	2016-02-26T03:09:46	.CharlieZCarroll Yes. They're so cynical about politicians that they don't care about, or perceive, policy differences. Just want attitude.
marykissel	703051378265083904	2016-02-26T02:58:05	This audit excuse is bull honky. There's no reason Trump can't release his past returns.

marykissel	703043340569284608	2016-02-26T02:26:08	.jpgr7221 Because Trump is the undisputed frontrunner. Cruz has to attack Trump if he wants to win.
marykissel	703042789886595073	2016-02-26T02:23:57	Cruz can't answer a simple question. Blitzer asks if he trusts Trump to nominate a conservative to SCOTUS. So Ted talks about himself?!?
marykissel	703041094330793984	2016-02-26T02:17:13	Good for Rubio for pointing out that Hispanics don't care solely about immigration!
marykissel	703040373959032832	2016-02-26T02:14:21	So, to review, Rubio's Trump attacks: hiring illegals, bankrupting companies, manufacturing hypocrisy, fake university, income, tax return.

marykissel	703036171467755521	2016-02-26T01:57:39	Wow. Cruz and Rubio understand this is a do-or-die debate. They're attacking the frontrunner, not each other.

marykissel	687105354832965632	2016-01-13T02:54:17	Classic Obama speech: taunting, boasting, demagoguing, snide, completely unhinged from reality. Degrades the Oval Office.
marykissel	687102996363218944	2016-01-13T02:44:54	Something tells me downplaying the ISIS threat isn't going to play well for the WhiteHouse, or for Democratic candidates.
marykissel	687102551318200320	2016-01-13T02:43:08	Remarkable to hear Obama argue U.S. strength abroad on the day Iran seizes 10 U.S. sailors. Strike that--it's beyond remarkable. Delusional.
marykissel	687101981798871040	2016-01-13T02:40:52	Agree. 
marykissel	687100563843067905	2016-01-13T02:35:14	Obama: 'We've protected an open internet.' Translation: 'We've imposed huge new regulations &amp; costs on an innovative &amp; creative industry.'
marykissel	687099359545176064	2016-01-13T02:30:27	'There is red tape to be cut.' Remember Obama's first term promise to make government transparent and efficient? Now broad based breakdowns.
marykissel	687099108008529922	2016-01-13T02:29:27	Reminder: The President had 7 years to strike a bipartisan deal to reform entitlements. Chose not to do so.
marykissel	687098556352737280	2016-01-13T02:27:16	Democratic theme emerging: technological change buffeting American workers. No mention of tax hikes, regulatory burdens, Obamacare costs.
marykissel	687098286466035712	2016-01-13T02:26:11	Classic Obama divisiveness: anyone with an alternate view of economic health (i.e. that it's weak) is 'peddling fiction.'
marykissel	687096329638666240	2016-01-13T02:18:25	Awkward boasts of recovery (2%? Hello?) energy sector (crashing), delivering care to vets (VA crisis, anyone?), gay marriage (SCOTUS ruling)
marykissel	687094690164944897	2016-01-13T02:11:54	Watching SOTU so you don't have to. Also: Curious to see how he'll spin a record of 2% growth and global disorder on his watch.
marykissel	687029407115001860	2016-01-12T21:52:29	Or convicting jrezaian. The list of Iranian deceit and terror is long. 
marykissel	687027051094740992	2016-01-12T21:43:07	Annals of the absurd. 
marykissel	687026637637038080	2016-01-12T21:41:29	Iran record, post-nuke deal? Grabs U.S. soldiers &amp; citizens, tests ballistic missiles, evades IAEA, funds terror, chants 'Death to America.'
marykissel	687025866145136640	2016-01-12T21:38:25	On the night of the President's last State of the Union address. Fitting.
