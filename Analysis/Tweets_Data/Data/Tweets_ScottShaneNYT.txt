ScottShaneNYT	697800719823310848	2016-02-11T15:13:50	Liked the way MPR started this interview, with a YouTube clip from Awlaki calling on Americans to join jihad

ScottShaneNYT	697428570352676864	2016-02-10T14:35:03	Alex__Katz Not sure it's obvious when it's unprecedented. Obama administration spent a lot of time studying whether this was legal.

ScottShaneNYT	697397698270375936	2016-02-10T12:32:22	Alex__Katz Thanks, Alex! How would you describe the policy and legal arguments? I hoped to complicate the beliefs of all ideologues.

ScottShaneNYT	696467190615117826	2016-02-07T22:54:52	erholp Thanks for watching! Agree CIA wrongly believed Saddam was working on WMD. The bogus White House part was hinting at a tie to 9/11.
