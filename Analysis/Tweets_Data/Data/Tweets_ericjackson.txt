ericjackson	685548849990078464	2016-01-08T19:49:17	The one takeaway from this BBG report: the YHOO board realizes they can't continue with Mayer as CEO. We made it clear why in our deck.

ericjackson	685545376779231232	2016-01-08T19:35:29	For YHOO board to float the idea of 10% job cuts as a way of staving off a proxy fight was laughable; today's news shows they get that now
ericjackson	685544894031605760	2016-01-08T19:33:34	SpringOwl's view from start has been (a) Mayer needs to go, (b) don't sell YHOO on the cheap, &amp; (c) why not bring in a LBTY as partner?
ericjackson	685544353717186561	2016-01-08T19:31:25	How will any YHOO shareholder be able to look at Mayer and not think of the $10B in misallocated capital in last 3+ years?
