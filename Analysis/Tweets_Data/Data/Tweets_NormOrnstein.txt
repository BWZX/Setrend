NormOrnstein	705594908363595776	2016-03-04T03:25:10	DanEggenWPost yep! the details are utterly meaningless
NormOrnstein	705594718441213952	2016-03-04T03:24:24	Finally-- in Michigan!-- almost 90 minutes into the debate a question about Flint! And a weaselly answer by Rubio
NormOrnstein	705591620255793153	2016-03-04T03:12:06	I think Trump might pick Megyn Kelly for his running mate!
NormOrnstein	705591247830917120	2016-03-04T03:10:37	But he'll build a wall and make Mexico pay for it! 
NormOrnstein	705590408110338049	2016-03-04T03:07:17	Rubio is having a terrible debate
NormOrnstein	705590157118980103	2016-03-04T03:06:17	.nickkristof yes, tough Fox questions. But read Eric. The narrowest band of questions at every GOP debate 
NormOrnstein	705587040063201280	2016-03-04T02:53:54	Cruz: yelling at people won't do the job. Instead, go on the Senate floor and call your own leader a liar
NormOrnstein	705586618866991104	2016-03-04T02:52:13	Wonder if John McCain is rethinking his pledge to support the Republican nominee
NormOrnstein	705585919928078336	2016-03-04T02:49:27	Stephen Douglas: I'm hung like a horse.  Abraham Lincoln: You lie, sir. Your wife has never been satisfied. She told me so herself.
NormOrnstein	705585963305545728	2016-03-04T02:49:37	When your party's theme is "you did build this," don't complain when your front-runner brags he's got stores worth more than Mitt Romney.
NormOrnstein	705585991185264641	2016-03-04T02:49:44	I repeat: it is time to take the Benghazi Committee and change it to the Trump Tape Committee! 
NormOrnstein	705585732551835648	2016-03-04T02:48:42	It's climate change! 
NormOrnstein	705585402435002368	2016-03-04T02:47:23	Lyin' Ted and Little Marco. Ugh.
NormOrnstein	705582800611762176	2016-03-04T02:37:03	Debate rules mean every attack on Trump gives him more time
NormOrnstein	705582512903430144	2016-03-04T02:35:54	It's a powerful argument that is working for him, to the immense frustration of his opponents 
NormOrnstein	705581892364603394	2016-03-04T02:33:26	While saying he will end crony capitalism because he knows it from the inside! 
NormOrnstein	705581276317749248	2016-03-04T02:30:59	One lesson of the Trump phenomenon is voters don't care about "crony capitalism" as such 
NormOrnstein	705581588235608065	2016-03-04T02:32:14	Simple answer: we're getting killed by China, we're getting killed by Mexico, I'll make health care great again 
NormOrnstein	705580586736476161	2016-03-04T02:28:15	Cruz condemns angry rhetoric. Trump says he's the guy who can bring people together. What planet are we watching?
NormOrnstein	705580018403975169	2016-03-04T02:26:00	Welcome to the future. Running Man takes place in 2017. 
NormOrnstein	705579492606124032	2016-03-04T02:23:54	This debate reminds me of Schwarznegger movie "The Running Man." Bloodthirsty crowd egging on the combatants
NormOrnstein	705577811340357633	2016-03-04T02:17:13	I remember watching presidential debates with my parents when I was a kid. If I had kids I don't think I'd let them watch these debates
NormOrnstein	705578427802370050	2016-03-04T02:19:40	It's not democracy. It's television.

NormOrnstein	705569808566325248	2016-03-04T01:45:25	Ben Carson says he is missing tonight's debate. Hasn't he missed the previous four? GOPDebate
NormOrnstein	705510611577401345	2016-03-03T21:50:12	Tweaking and improving it would fit long tradition of policy-making in Congress, blown up by GOP in Obama years 
NormOrnstein	705509518646648832	2016-03-03T21:45:51	Just keep in mind that he ignored the GOP lurch to the radical side for years

NormOrnstein	704873972702253059	2016-03-02T03:40:25	Here's an idea: turn the Benghazi Committee into a Trump Tape Committee! 
NormOrnstein	704873343388946436	2016-03-02T03:37:55	It is simply embarrassing to see MSNBC put Tom DeLay on air. There is no shame
NormOrnstein	704697130146013185	2016-03-01T15:57:43	"The Republican Party condemns racism in all its forms" "Will you guys restore the Voting Rights Act?" "Hang on my earpiece is broken"
NormOrnstein	704869612672983040	2016-03-02T03:23:06	The irony of the fact that Ted Cruz is the GOP establishment's only hope to beat Donald Trump is just... exquisite.
NormOrnstein	704869656679620608	2016-03-02T03:23:16	"Obama's TARP Wall Street Bailout" was actually proposed and signed into law by George W. Bush and backed by Ryan, Pelosi, McConnell &amp; Reid

NormOrnstein	704861036713787393	2016-03-02T02:49:01	No, I is his favorite word. He won't abandon it 
NormOrnstein	704860337921626112	2016-03-02T02:46:14	Trump: Come for the bigotry, stay for the awful policies  
NormOrnstein	704857148463910912	2016-03-02T02:33:34	Disappointing. Should be Hamm's, from the land of sky blue waters 
NormOrnstein	704856559793393666	2016-03-02T02:31:14	Rubio might have also played a role 
NormOrnstein	704852085934845952	2016-03-02T02:13:27	You're not giving Trump his due. Sleazy con man authoritarian at least!

NormOrnstein	704845046185590784	2016-03-02T01:45:29	I think he stays in for that reason 
NormOrnstein	704842391317041152	2016-03-02T01:34:56	If true, Rubio is on a path to nowhere

NormOrnstein	704693520460701696	2016-03-01T15:43:22	tripgabriel NormOrnstein I'd say 1964 was the pivot. Goldwater won Southern states, got only 6% of black vote.
NormOrnstein	704692536749780994	2016-03-01T15:39:27	Historians would say the GOP ceased being "the party of Lincoln" around 1968 w Nixon's Southern strategy.

NormOrnstein	704473410085191680	2016-03-01T01:08:44	That's why so many of his colleagues privately say they like him. Not. 
NormOrnstein	704471416352219136	2016-03-01T01:00:48	Good point. But not all. Juices flowing more on GOP side, so many candidates &amp; out of WH for 8 yrs. wait til fall!

NormOrnstein	698958892227784704	2016-02-14T19:56:00	Also, Dem pres could nominate Klobuchar, Whitehouse, even Merrick Garland. Hard to filibuster!

NormOrnstein	698692366505549825	2016-02-14T02:16:55	Nothing sharper in contrast between Ds and Rs. Every candidate on stage would pick someone as conservative or more so than Scalia.

NormOrnstein	698690340686077952	2016-02-14T02:08:52	Trump: "It's called delay, delay, delay." Actually, it's called obstruction, obstruction, obstruction.
NormOrnstein	698679057593008128	2016-02-14T01:24:02	Exactly, no recess appt 
NormOrnstein	698678894703022080	2016-02-14T01:23:23	Exactly, Gene. But if appeals court says no, VP nominee will be sworn in on Jan 20, and become president via 20th A 
NormOrnstein	698678140672020484	2016-02-14T01:20:24	That path was blocked by 2014 NLRB decision 
NormOrnstein	698677337349611521	2016-02-14T01:17:12	Depends on his Veep choice 
NormOrnstein	698676213112557568	2016-02-14T01:12:44	Justices Brennan, Warren, Stewart all had recess appointments initially
NormOrnstein	698675292991262720	2016-02-14T01:09:05	Always happy to oblige! 
NormOrnstein	698674942968205313	2016-02-14T01:07:41	There have been recess appts to the Supreme Court. But 2014 decision on NLRB has knocked out that possibility
NormOrnstein	698672296895062016	2016-02-14T00:57:10	No subtraction of Senate vote, Gov Dayton would make quick appointment 
NormOrnstein	698671210117337088	2016-02-14T00:52:51	Also a senator, very important to have someone with legislative, elective backgrounds 
NormOrnstein	698670647849910272	2016-02-14T00:50:37	Here are three: Sri Srinavasan, Amy Klobuchar, Merrick Garland 
NormOrnstein	698669311062368257	2016-02-14T00:45:19	I'm guessing 2024 
NormOrnstein	698669218368241665	2016-02-14T00:44:56	If he had played his cards differently, he wouldn't be Cruz! 
NormOrnstein	698669050252152832	2016-02-14T00:44:16	Or he says Carl Icahn would make a GREAT justice! 
NormOrnstein	698668541592150017	2016-02-14T00:42:15	Amy was the right kind of prosecutor, very sensitive to process, rights, and human factor 
NormOrnstein	698668311761022977	2016-02-14T00:41:20	He could, but would have to resign the presidency if confirmed 
NormOrnstein	698665097942671362	2016-02-14T00:28:34	A low moment. But w/ Amy, they couldn't demonize, would have to say only reason was to block Obama for almost a year 
NormOrnstein	698664566214037504	2016-02-14T00:26:27	They will be pressured mightily by right and their own pres nominee 
NormOrnstein	698661305855700993	2016-02-14T00:13:30	Another good choice for Obama might actually be Amy Klobuchar-- smart, liked by all senators, former prosecutor
NormOrnstein	698660714832121856	2016-02-14T00:11:09	A 4-4 court would let a Dem pres gain more leverage over appeals courts, take broad exec action w/o SC overturning

NormOrnstein	698655247015796737	2016-02-13T23:49:25	We already had McConnell say so! 
NormOrnstein	698655034628648960	2016-02-13T23:48:35	In recent decades, biggest issue in presidential elections was Supreme Court, but not to voters-- too theoretical.Not theoretical any more!
NormOrnstein	698654644214632449	2016-02-13T23:47:02	Fate of huge and critical issues depends now on which circuit hears them! 
NormOrnstein	698653690341781505	2016-02-13T23:43:14	Actually the American people do have a voice, set with the 2012 presidential election 
NormOrnstein	698651816460943362	2016-02-13T23:35:48	If Obama nominates quickly and Senate Repubs refuse to do a vote, it becomes huge issue of Republican obstructionism 
NormOrnstein	698650841977331716	2016-02-13T23:31:55	No precedent for 10 month delay/blockage, most choices w/ pres and Sen of same party 
NormOrnstein	698650281131827201	2016-02-13T23:29:41	I agree with Jeff Toobin-- Sri Srinavasin of DC Circuit 
NormOrnstein	698638530394910721	2016-02-13T22:43:00	Say it is June, and it is Clinton v Trump. Think McConnell might decide better to go for a moderate Obama pick than wait for D pres &amp; Sen?
NormOrnstein	698634040694300672	2016-02-13T22:25:09	Justice Scalia's untimely passing reminder that we should have fixed, maybe 18-year terms for justices, with regular replacement procedures.
NormOrnstein	698583692151750657	2016-02-13T19:05:05	Yep, no doubt the bully pulpit will get the Freedom Caucus, Mitch McConnell, et al, to cave

NormOrnstein	698568654464614400	2016-02-13T18:05:20	Actually, Bernie is very nice to them, and all like him. Their considered judgment is that he can't get stuff done 
NormOrnstein	698568221700526080	2016-02-13T18:03:37	Actually, whether there should be a balance

NormOrnstein	696148898658840580	2016-02-07T01:50:05	I don't think 23% of public thinks country is going in wrong direction because of North Korea. Maybe questions about most pressing issues?
NormOrnstein	696148430461259776	2016-02-07T01:48:14	Bush is right. Under W, we were so tough North Korea dismantled nuclear program, had no hostages. Oops.

NormOrnstein	696144835095429122	2016-02-07T01:33:57	Attack that Rubio just uses memorized 25 second  speech is penetrating. Rubio and Christie are doing great jobs eviscerating eachother
NormOrnstein	696144297339572225	2016-02-07T01:31:48	Strong attack by Christie, but if record matters, his is a disaster
NormOrnstein	696144158059315200	2016-02-07T01:31:15	Very, very weak answer from Rubio about his accomplishments. Had to fall back on attacking Biden, Obama and saying how great America is
