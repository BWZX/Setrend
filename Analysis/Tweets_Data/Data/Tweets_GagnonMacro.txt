GagnonMacro	704330138138316800	2016-02-29T15:39:25	tylercowen I don't see any need for prices to adjust. GSG is effectively an equilibrium outcome. Some countries want to save more.

GagnonMacro	704316247215874048	2016-02-29T14:44:13	tylercowen My view is that GSG has nothing to do with sticky prices. Rather it is about inefficient financial markets and govt distortions.
