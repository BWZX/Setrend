WorthWray	723862846057009153	2016-04-23T13:15:25	darpanbiswas But I think the point was to weaken USD a bit (but not too much) &amp; take away the FX catalysts for a global crisis.
WorthWray	723862104181075968	2016-04-23T13:12:29	darpanbiswas USD had probably run out of steam in terms of fundamentals (unless foreign crisis was about to occur w/o another leg up).
WorthWray	723861705302806528	2016-04-23T13:10:53	darpanbiswas At the time of G20, I think it was C. USD could have surged higher, but depended on foreign CBs &amp;/or global risk aversion.
WorthWray	723860428443381761	2016-04-23T13:05:49	darpanbiswas Not that what we're seeing today is necessarily as extensive or formal as Plaza. It could be, but we just don't know.
WorthWray	723859930797641729	2016-04-23T13:03:50	darpanbiswas I'm saying it depends on the situation. In this case, a repeat of the Plaza experience (crashing $) would prob be a disaster.

WorthWray	723736504774725634	2016-04-23T04:53:23	AdamBScott1979 RaoulGMI Just I've been saying since late 2015. USD largely depended on foreign CBs &amp;/or risk aversion to keep running.
WorthWray	723736147189321729	2016-04-23T04:51:58	AdamBScott1979 RaoulGMI But even with global growth stabilizing, policy shifts like ECB or BoJ easing could galvanize USD upside again.
WorthWray	723735862928793600	2016-04-23T04:50:50	AdamBScott1979 RaoulGMI On the flip side, commodity reflation helps stabilize global growth &amp; attracts outflows out of US, so can weaken $
WorthWray	723735479389028352	2016-04-23T04:49:19	AdamBScott1979 RaoulGMI Oh it can go both ways. If Saudis flood mkt &amp; push oil prices way down I think it can fuel USD on risk aversion.
WorthWray	723735145425985538	2016-04-23T04:47:59	AdamBScott1979 RaoulGMI Then again, I do believe major CBs are still trying to contain $ &amp; stave off a RMB shock. But it's a give &amp; take.
WorthWray	723734699911180288	2016-04-23T04:46:13	AdamBScott1979 RaoulGMI Nope. I think trade weighted USD breakout to new highs would send commodity prices way back down.

WorthWray	723603246204383232	2016-04-22T20:03:52	_aaronchan_ That said, we're seeing some signs that demand could accelerate too assuming USD remains contained.

WorthWray	721682916191838208	2016-04-17T12:53:10	darpanbiswas So if this is a true (albeit quiet) accord, I think it's about containing/softening $... not sharply reversing the trend.

WorthWray	718160556360802304	2016-04-07T19:36:34	elrabbit Lol that's just how Liz Ann sees it. She's saying the data tide is turning &amp; data coming in better than expectations.
WorthWray	718157897197223936	2016-04-07T19:26:00	tourspin LizAnnSonders Recession is as certain as death &amp; taxes. But timing still up in the air &amp; that risk appears to be receding for now
WorthWray	718157543550242816	2016-04-07T19:24:35	elrabbit I wouldn't call it a reliable indicator for recession or the lack thereof. But it does suggest data is beating expectations.
WorthWray	718157300414816257	2016-04-07T19:23:37	kylerake It's very cyclical as you can see. But some big macro players use these indices as *one* input in assessing the global outlook.
WorthWray	718157076640305152	2016-04-07T19:22:44	kylerake Not a perfect indicator by any means, but a lot of upside surprise can lead to better sentiment which can feed back into markets.
WorthWray	718156793734627332	2016-04-07T19:21:36	kylerake So with both the US &amp; global indices coming in much stronger it implies that data is starting to beat expectations.

WorthWray	713735652374765568	2016-03-26T14:33:34	JamesGRickards bvincent23 chewy8286 Also a very plausible scenario. We're already far into the tightening cycle.

WorthWray	713596612103122945	2016-03-26T05:21:04	"We're seeing the strong dollar trade unwinding a bit, &amp; that has helped those beaten-down areas really take off." 
WorthWray	713595867639390208	2016-03-26T05:18:07	agurevich23 JamesGRickards My pleasure &amp; glad to hear your thoughts, Alex. It will be fascinating to see how this plays out.
WorthWray	713594146909327360	2016-03-26T05:11:17	agurevich23 graystoke JamesGRickards Maybe, but what I'm saying is that recent moves may mark early stages of a much bigger campaign.
WorthWray	713593775797317635	2016-03-26T05:09:48	polan13 agurevich23 graystoke JamesGRickards I disagree. Draghi's latest move was masterful. Here's my latest.

WorthWray	713560746370535424	2016-03-26T02:58:33	bvincent23 JamesGRickards chewy8286 But *IF* we see a coordinated sell-down in USD like Plaza Accord, USD could weaken even as Fed hikes.
WorthWray	713560238868209665	2016-03-26T02:56:32	bvincent23 JamesGRickards chewy8286 Absolutely not. Depends on so many factors &amp; it's too early to say what will happen.

WorthWray	713474239484018692	2016-03-25T21:14:49	stawealthadv azientek Not that we know of!
WorthWray	713474061742026754	2016-03-25T21:14:06	BenEisen So I wonder if the 1985 Plaza Accord would have worked more effectively if it had been kept quiet &amp; executed subtly.
WorthWray	713473757692739584	2016-03-25T21:12:54	BenEisen I actually think the forceful announcement in Sept 1985 was the reason Plaza overshot in subsequent years.
WorthWray	713473237661913088	2016-03-25T21:10:50	BenEisen Cool. Will do!
WorthWray	713471319724199936	2016-03-25T21:03:12	BenEisen Writing a note on this next week &amp; will be interested to hear your thoughts.
WorthWray	713471224987430913	2016-03-25T21:02:50	BenEisen Not to mention that we're smack dab in the middle of the economic environments in which they've historically happened.
WorthWray	713470885382987776	2016-03-25T21:01:29	BenEisen Totally understand, but there's a long history of backroom central bank &amp;/or treasury interventions in the FX markets.
WorthWray	713465335639355392	2016-03-25T20:39:26	BenEisen Not by much. 1% max. I don't see tacit CB coordination as equivalent to the '85 Plaza Accord. But it may evolve along those lines.

WorthWray	713420269382184960	2016-03-25T17:40:21	agurevich23 chewy8286 I don't think it's that complicated. JamesGRickards hit on this too. 
WorthWray	713419772571095040	2016-03-25T17:38:23	Given how world has evolved, strong USD is more destructive today than it was in 1985. DonDraperClone 
WorthWray	713418916622630912	2016-03-25T17:34:59	agurevich23 JamesGRickards Also would make sense to move quietly considering that Plaza worked too well.
WorthWray	713418673374015488	2016-03-25T17:34:01	agurevich23 JamesGRickards But the politics are dicey here. Would make sense to keep it quiet.
WorthWray	713418568617050113	2016-03-25T17:33:36	agurevich23 JamesGRickards It's very possible we could see major countries act to sell USD &amp; maybe even buy RMB.
WorthWray	713418298390609920	2016-03-25T17:32:31	agurevich23 JamesGRickards My question is whether post-Shanghai CB moves evolve into bigger intervention like the Plaza Accord.
WorthWray	713417957846679553	2016-03-25T17:31:10	agurevich23 JamesGRickards So given recent moves, I don't think it's such a stretch to think CBs may be cooperating to avoid RMB shock.
WorthWray	713417599099473922	2016-03-25T17:29:44	agurevich23 JamesGRickards chewy8286 Fed, ECB, &amp; BoJ all have a common interest in avoiding a disorderly RMB shock.
WorthWray	713417282106572805	2016-03-25T17:28:29	agurevich23 JamesGRickards chewy8286 And considering that stronger USD feeds China outflows, USD catalysts were also RMB shock catalysts.
WorthWray	713416454507507712	2016-03-25T17:25:12	agurevich23 JamesGRickards chewy8286 By January 2016, the trade weighted USD largely depended on ECB, BoJ, &amp; PBoC to push higher.
WorthWray	713399728243875840	2016-03-25T16:18:44	If G20 policymakers really are intervening in FX similar to the 1985 Plaza Accord, USD may weaken even as Fed hikes.

WorthWray	709695196875743232	2016-03-15T10:58:15	johnkass48 Gotta stay on guard. Better for China to float from a position of strength &amp; at a time when the shock would be less powerful.
WorthWray	709693754823737344	2016-03-15T10:52:31	gaurav_jalan Not for very long unless a global macro regime shift (e.g. higher inflation) changes policy needs after a modest lag.

WorthWray	709692982216142848	2016-03-15T10:49:27	from_10000ft Agreed. I'm not convinced a CB truce will last. Wise move would prob be to devalue RMB in an orderly way while USD is weak.

WorthWray	709595788960092160	2016-03-15T04:23:14	If not a formal CB detente, then least a reverence for mutually assured destruction if competitive easing continues.

WorthWray	709594619269386240	2016-03-15T04:18:35	SteveSmithChart Maybe. I can be wrong. But to be clear, I'm focused on the broad trade weighted USD index.
WorthWray	709593235966955521	2016-03-15T04:13:05	Draghi had to ease, but he did so via credit channel &amp; kept € strong. BoJ sat tight. Both shied away from fueling USD higher. nsgcinvest
WorthWray	709592752586002432	2016-03-15T04:11:10	Even then, USD has basically run out of steam without a boost from competitive easing in Europe, Japan, or China.

WorthWray	709489658506313728	2016-03-14T21:21:30	danjohnmyers johnkass48 Damn straight.
WorthWray	709489553292144640	2016-03-14T21:21:05	RHornik prchovanec Agreed, but doesn't mean they can't pull growth forward for a while!
WorthWray	709485535576854528	2016-03-14T21:05:07	ToupMaster _aaronchan_ Not familiar enough to have an opinion!
WorthWray	709484247795367938	2016-03-14T21:00:00	SantiagoAuFund bblawrence8 I think pressure for a forced-float is receding with the USD. But doesn't mean Beijing will delay indefinitely.
WorthWray	709482085019308032	2016-03-14T20:51:25	_aaronchan_ Which ECB &amp; BoJ know could create a global deflationary shock. Counterproductive in trying to support growth &amp; inflation.
WorthWray	709481486638915584	2016-03-14T20:49:02	_aaronchan_ That's the key. Aggressive competitive devaluation abroad would fuel USD &amp; likely force Beijing to free float the RMB.
WorthWray	709481282032390144	2016-03-14T20:48:13	johnkass48 I personally think that a weaker USD will likely lift the drag on US economic growth &amp; fuel a transitory pop in CPI.
WorthWray	709480956772528129	2016-03-14T20:46:56	bblawrence8 Agreed. Although Beijing still has a limited ability to fight the current.
WorthWray	709480783166058496	2016-03-14T20:46:14	Alpha is a negative sum game after fees &amp; the legends don't always win!  
WorthWray	709480630069792769	2016-03-14T20:45:38	As long as USD is weakening, Beijing won't be *forced* to de-peg. But intentional RMB "reform" still on the table. 
WorthWray	709479841108594690	2016-03-14T20:42:30	This is why the risk of RMB float/devaluation will keep hanging over us even if the USD weakens for a while. 
WorthWray	709479561218498560	2016-03-14T20:41:23	johnkass48 I disagree to some extent, but totally agree that we have to respect uncertainty at every stage of the investing process here.
WorthWray	709479127263219712	2016-03-14T20:39:40	We've already seen a lot of divergence. I was an early voice on that front. Convergence now becoming the trend. ThomasSieckmann Leomatrade
WorthWray	709478805274951680	2016-03-14T20:38:23	The Fed only cares about global stability to the extent that it impacts its domestic dual mandate. I do not expect a course change. u99osni
WorthWray	709477942435315714	2016-03-14T20:34:57	TonyNashOnAsia Finally coming around to (or at least admitting) the obvious.
WorthWray	709459520993386496	2016-03-14T19:21:45	johnkass48 I think we're in the middle of a big global macro shift, but have no idea if it will last for a few months or a few years.
WorthWray	709459045325737984	2016-03-14T19:19:52	Beijing has the fiscal room to stabilize China's economic growth for a while, but at the risk of losing control again over time.
WorthWray	709458835472121856	2016-03-14T19:19:02	The risk of a disorderly RMB shock is receding as USD weakens, but it will continue to hang over our heads for the foreseeable future.
WorthWray	709458544257445888	2016-03-14T19:17:52	johnkass48 I agree, John. RMB float/deval may still happen, but if it happens anytime soon it won't be because of strong USD pressure.
WorthWray	709458194557304836	2016-03-14T19:16:29	Critical point on the apparent "truce" between major central banks. It can last for a while, but can't last forever. 
WorthWray	709457282308841472	2016-03-14T19:12:51	johnkass48 Just look at the ECB last week. Easing via the credit channel, but being careful not to fuel USD higher &amp; risk a RMB shock.
WorthWray	709457034479931392	2016-03-14T19:11:52	Whether or not the CB community agreed to a concrete deal at G-20, spillover awareness appears to be driving a global policy shift (for now)
WorthWray	709456096688103424	2016-03-14T19:08:09	There's a growing awareness in the global central banking community that currency movements have major repercussions.
WorthWray	709450575176462337	2016-03-14T18:46:12	MacroViewDan Haha probably not as often as I should!
WorthWray	709365767800643588	2016-03-14T13:09:13	Agreed. Not over by a long shot.  
WorthWray	709356712373854208	2016-03-14T12:33:14	KlendathuCap At this point, there's no reason to expect many Fed hikes in 2016. But hike trajectory will change if USD weakens for a while.
WorthWray	709356466784772096	2016-03-14T12:32:15	KlendathuCap Either way, ECB has fired its shot. So unless we see aggressive BoJ action to weaken ¥, the USD has probably already peaked.

WorthWray	709232073366568961	2016-03-14T04:17:57	dhanu_lagna That leaves EMs another window to get their act together.
WorthWray	709231912687042560	2016-03-14T04:17:19	dhanu_lagna Yeah the China fiscal stimulus story will likely last for a while, but increases longer term risks.
WorthWray	709230688671633410	2016-03-14T04:12:27	dhanu_lagna So this story can come full circle &amp; I am not convinced it marks the end of the overall USD bull trend.
WorthWray	709230520106782720	2016-03-14T04:11:47	dhanu_lagna In that case, Fed may decide to hike rates more aggressively, which would bring USD back up &amp; renew pressure on EMs.
WorthWray	709230324866125824	2016-03-14T04:11:00	dhanu_lagna If USD weakens for a while it will likely remove a major drag on US growth &amp; feed a transitory pop in US inflation data.

WorthWray	709227668579835904	2016-03-14T04:00:27	HayekAndKeynes I agree, but do think weaker USD + China fiscal stimulus could lead to improvement in the EM picture for a while.

WorthWray	709223639464304640	2016-03-14T03:44:27	HayekAndKeynes And strangely enough, we could see inflation in Eurozone &amp; Japan move up with commodities in spite of currency appreciation.
WorthWray	709223195136536577	2016-03-14T03:42:41	HayekAndKeynes I think a weaker USD would contribute to a reflation in commodities, improvement in EMs, &amp; transitory pop in US inflation.

WorthWray	709207165270032384	2016-03-14T02:38:59	ThomasSieckmann Big shift to me, considering that ECB &amp; BoJ easing were the catalysts I'd been expecting to take USD higher &amp; RMB lower.

WorthWray	709083292650307584	2016-03-13T18:26:45	WorthWray I think if we get a weak $ and China levels out we could get a massive risk on move that could last months

WorthWray	709200155828813825	2016-03-14T02:11:08	TheZachBroyles Also bear in mind the institutional fear of RMB shock going into the G-20 Shanghai meeting.

WorthWray	709198343168086017	2016-03-14T02:03:55	Charlie_Ledezma DowdEdward I think that's very possible. Buybacks could come back within the US if global conditions improve.
WorthWray	709198023759241218	2016-03-14T02:02:39	craigsiena TheEuchre And given the likely size of China's true NPLs, it's just a smoke &amp; mirrors game.

WorthWray	709197014236401664	2016-03-14T01:58:39	TheEuchre But all this actually makes me much more worried about China in the long term as Xi is clearly prioritizing growth over reform.
WorthWray	709196851950387200	2016-03-14T01:58:00	TheEuchre I think China can stabilize for a while on fiscal stimulus &amp; weaker USD should calm capital outflows for a while.
WorthWray	709196445920833536	2016-03-14T01:56:23	MarcoMNYC Whatever. If not for China fiscal stimulus &amp; a post-G20 change in CB action, we would likely still be heading for a crisis.
WorthWray	709195992428470272	2016-03-14T01:54:35	TheEuchre Doesn't help in longer term. Actually increases the risks of economic &amp; political crisis. But could stabilize growth for a while.
WorthWray	709195688727285760	2016-03-14T01:53:23	TheEuchre But that seems to have changed, thus my different USD view. Just trying to adapt as this story evolved &amp; stay honest.
WorthWray	709195535329009665	2016-03-14T01:52:46	TheEuchre Yes. All hinges around USD for me. I thought we'd see more competitive easing by ECB &amp; BoJ, which would pressure PBoC to float.
WorthWray	709195233783709697	2016-03-14T01:51:34	ml8_ml8 But that story likely to evolve if Fed forced to hike more aggressively as a result of a weak USD &amp; transitory pop in inflation.
WorthWray	709195061674713088	2016-03-14T01:50:53	ml8_ml8 I don't think so. If Fed hikes slowly, USD can still weaken for a while if global growth stabilizes.
WorthWray	709194875854462977	2016-03-14T01:50:09	ml8_ml8 From that perspective, the trade weighted USD could give back maybe 1/3 to 1/2 of its gains since 2011 as EM currencies rally.
WorthWray	709194700117270528	2016-03-14T01:49:27	ml8_ml8 I think weakening in the trade weighted USD will likely be a lot more about EM &amp; commodity currencies reflating.
WorthWray	709194471166992384	2016-03-14T01:48:32	MarcoMNYC Although we disagreed over whether USD drag &amp; risk of foreign shocks threatened US recession, it's prob a moot point for now.
WorthWray	709194031922712577	2016-03-14T01:46:48	MarcoMNYC So we're talking about a very global shift in nature. If true it absolutely changes the facts for the US for a while.
WorthWray	709193549237981184	2016-03-14T01:44:52	MarcoMNYC In turn, weaker USD likely means reduced drag on US growth, broad reflation in commodity prices, &amp; a transitory inflation pop.
WorthWray	709193351937937410	2016-03-14T01:44:05	MarcoMNYC No global facts have changed with China fiscal stimulus pump &amp; shift in foreign CB policy. Both likely give us a weaker USD.
WorthWray	709193109192609793	2016-03-14T01:43:08	ml8_ml8 For the record, I'm not saying it's a secular shift in the bond market.
WorthWray	709193009586241537	2016-03-14T01:42:44	ml8_ml8 I think USD weakening for a while could produce a transitory inflation pop in developed markets. So yields in general could rise.
WorthWray	709192619985739777	2016-03-14T01:41:11	ThomasSieckmann What day was this from?
WorthWray	709192268834418688	2016-03-14T01:39:47	MarcoMNYC I think the facts have changed since last month &amp; may be flipping us into a new macro regime for a while. Feels kind of like '98.
WorthWray	709191821746786304	2016-03-14T01:38:01	To be perfectly honest, I'm struggling with the US equity outlook at the moment. Need to keep thinking. 
WorthWray	709191302802313216	2016-03-14T01:35:57	feral_hog Yeah that's the nature of the news cycle. Most things are already priced in by the time Bloomberg writes a story.
WorthWray	709190927256977408	2016-03-14T01:34:27	Yes. I believe facts have changed with China fiscal stimulus ramping &amp; ECB+BoJ policy evolving to avoid a RMB shock. 
WorthWray	709190144826351616	2016-03-14T01:31:21	W/ China fiscal stimulus ramping &amp; foreign CBs treading lightly, it now appears global growth stabilizing &amp; USD may weaken for a while (2/2)
WorthWray	709188862644322306	2016-03-14T01:26:15	Just before it peaked in Jan, I said trade weighted USD outlook depended on foreign FX easing or risk aversion (1/2) 
WorthWray	709188134274117632	2016-03-14T01:23:21	With US Treasury bond trading now dominated by foreign events, rates could soon pop if global growth stabilizes. 
WorthWray	709186417964883968	2016-03-14T01:16:32	KlendathuCap Although the BoJ meeting is more important to watch on this thesis.
WorthWray	709185880540327936	2016-03-14T01:14:24	KlendathuCap I think Fed probably waits until June.
WorthWray	709077919444770816	2016-03-13T18:05:24	prchovanec That's actually my concern. That Xi will pump to maintain growth now &amp; exhaust balance sheet room he'll need later.
WorthWray	709077458348183552	2016-03-13T18:03:34	prchovanec But what's to stop Xi from using the balance sheet to boost/maintain growth today?
WorthWray	709075369647706112	2016-03-13T17:55:16	prchovanec Call me crazy, but I do think Beijing has fiscal room &amp; ability to at least maintain growth for a while.

WorthWray	709063457178411009	2016-03-13T17:07:56	alialsalim And if USD truly is set to weaken for a while, then it could mean a big improvement in global trade value &amp; EM export revenues.
WorthWray	709063150964908032	2016-03-13T17:06:43	alialsalim Sure. But a marginally weaker USD compared to January means marginally stronger trade &amp; $-revs to EM exporters.

WorthWray	709061282561859584	2016-03-13T16:59:18	Nairiyya We're talking about fiscal deficit spending here, so debt-driven government spending. Yes, it likely weighs on long-term growth.
WorthWray	709057590525878273	2016-03-13T16:44:37	prchovanec You don't think ramping fiscal stimulus can help stabilize China's growth in the short-term w/ global investment implications?
WorthWray	709056969319907328	2016-03-13T16:42:09	Nairiyya Likely boosts short-term growth at the expense of long-term growth &amp; stability. But investment implications are big.
