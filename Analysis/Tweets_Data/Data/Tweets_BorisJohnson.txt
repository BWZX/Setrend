BorisJohnson	694104160699039744	2016-02-01T10:25:02	We should all denounce this week’s Tube strike – but Sadiq Khan won’t. Come on, Khan: man up.

BorisJohnson	686550734167498753	2016-01-11T14:10:25	Ken Livingstone bowed to the unions, Sadiq Khan would do the same: 
BorisJohnson	686535132321312772	2016-01-11T13:08:25	Incredibly Sadiq Khan won't condemn this pointless strike. Massive support amongst Londoners for the night tube. He is stuck in the past.
BorisJohnson	686516575759896576	2016-01-11T11:54:41	The BMA leadership is in the grip of advanced Corbynitis:

BorisJohnson	661145791189417984	2015-11-02T11:40:14	Cumberbatch was right to bash us politicians – but not for the reasons he gave. 
BorisJohnson	659047524158844928	2015-10-27T16:42:28	It’s intergenerational fairness:  
BorisJohnson	653492587291115520	2015-10-12T08:49:08	It's not about you, it's about them: 
BorisJohnson	651014019550179328	2015-10-05T12:40:12	Great to open new constituency office of William_Wragg, MP for Hazel Grove and meet the good people of Marple
