AdamSerwer	718892165078872064	2016-04-09T20:03:43	I think this is pretty much correct 
AdamSerwer	718891551116668929	2016-04-09T20:01:16	Because he's talking about Trump, who is about as goyishe as it gets 
AdamSerwer	718890555791552512	2016-04-09T19:57:19	It's also not 1960. There's not really a constituency for overt or implicit anti-semitism that Cruz would be aiming for with that remark.

AdamSerwer	714132430001545216	2016-03-27T16:50:13	white innocence is one of the more destructive cultural forces in American history sorry if that hurts your feelings 
AdamSerwer	714131418238943232	2016-03-27T16:46:12	True. Trump's are way higher. 
AdamSerwer	714130263089897472	2016-03-27T16:41:37	That unpopularity is also the result of media coverage of Trump. So.
AdamSerwer	714130065458470912	2016-03-27T16:40:50	Also: Trump is very unpopular. We are just not seeing it because the groups he's most unpopular among don't vote in republican primaries.
AdamSerwer	714127367732473857	2016-03-27T16:30:06	A blatantly racist candidate doesn't preserve white innocence, it impugns it 
AdamSerwer	714126761932361729	2016-03-27T16:27:42	*whispers* I think the media created trump thesis is about preserving white innocence

AdamSerwer	713898741196070913	2016-03-27T01:21:38	I really feel like the media created trump thesis gives short shrift to the number of people who are unapologetically racist
AdamSerwer	713785677796605952	2016-03-26T17:52:21	It's because we all know "america" means "white people"

AdamSerwer	713560156274049025	2016-03-26T02:56:13	The movie is bad, sorry, get as solipsistic as you want about it

AdamSerwer	713556627970998272	2016-03-26T02:42:12	Yes. Batman v superman isn't even enjoyable as trash because it's so self serious. 
AdamSerwer	713555712031326209	2016-03-26T02:38:33	It's objectively better in terms of real world product. I prefer DC comics and marvel movies are much better. 
AdamSerwer	713554493414182912	2016-03-26T02:33:43	I will never understand why they didn't hand control of the DC cinematic universe to Bruce Timm.

AdamSerwer	713552291152969732	2016-03-26T02:24:58	The problem with batman v superman isn't that it's dark. It's that it's dreary and boring and Zack Snyder doesn't understand altruism.

AdamSerwer	703746834632679425	2016-02-28T01:01:35	No it's that Rocky is an even better black boxer than a black boxer 
AdamSerwer	703743674107228160	2016-02-28T00:49:01	Also I'm amused that there are still people who think "black character facilitates white character's success" is an innocent cinematic trope

AdamSerwer	703737802266169344	2016-02-28T00:25:41	So, the statement that a white boxer humbles a black fighter in every rocky movie is correct 
AdamSerwer	703704541494124544	2016-02-27T22:13:31	So you don't understand the difference between a comparison and an analogy either 
AdamSerwer	703701506017648644	2016-02-27T22:01:27	Accurate. As an analogy, the existence of white prisoners does not exonerate the criminal justice system of racism.

AdamSerwer	703384976843280384	2016-02-27T01:03:41	he bears responsibility, but he didn't stop the fight because creed begged him not to.... 
AdamSerwer	703382887278755840	2016-02-27T00:55:23	this is the absence of a counterargument 
AdamSerwer	703380794673373184	2016-02-27T00:47:04	no i'm pointing out the very unsubtle racial subtext of all the films upended by CREED 
AdamSerwer	703376867970121728	2016-02-27T00:31:28	"starts" being the key word here

AdamSerwer	703372425145262080	2016-02-27T00:13:48	white sports anything 
AdamSerwer	703371950182293504	2016-02-27T00:11:55	the rocky movies are an incredible cultural monument to white masculinity, it's basically anthropology 
AdamSerwer	703371635789864960	2016-02-27T00:10:40	in your defense i literally just rewatched all of them to write this thing 
AdamSerwer	703370794840281089	2016-02-27T00:07:20	i mean they try to talk him out of it, he thinks he's gonna win the cold war. only rocky can do that! 
AdamSerwer	703368789132505088	2016-02-26T23:59:21	Anyway all of this Rocky tweeting is promo for an essay I wrote on CREED which I'll send out as a newsletter tomorrow
AdamSerwer	703368548295548928	2016-02-26T23:58:24	They say that when it's happening, but Apollo goes into it to make the Russians "look bad for a change." 
AdamSerwer	703367276406431744	2016-02-26T23:53:21	Ali really is the greatest  
AdamSerwer	703366603669446657	2016-02-26T23:50:40	This figures heavily in CREED 
AdamSerwer	703366467203551232	2016-02-26T23:50:08	yo this is amazing. 
AdamSerwer	703366165708541953	2016-02-26T23:48:56	as long as we pummel them into submission first we can be friends 
AdamSerwer	703366025660788736	2016-02-26T23:48:23	Exactly. All because Creed didn't learn his lesson in Rockys I and II that he's not a "real champion" 
AdamSerwer	703365856202510337	2016-02-26T23:47:42	Clubber Lang Was Right 
AdamSerwer	703365660991221760	2016-02-26T23:46:56	Indeed. Until CREED he is merely the facilitator of Rocky's success, not great in his own right. 
AdamSerwer	703365428828119040	2016-02-26T23:46:00	No, Clubber Lang is right about everything. Rocky is ducking him. press literally tells him to "dance." &lt;3 Clubber 
AdamSerwer	703365214582996997	2016-02-26T23:45:09	he loses to a split decision, and still humbles the flamboyant ali-like champ 
AdamSerwer	703365026107760640	2016-02-26T23:44:24	i am apparently the only person who has seen this movie 
AdamSerwer	703364951793082370	2016-02-26T23:44:07	I don't know if he said it but it's true 
AdamSerwer	703364797413330944	2016-02-26T23:43:30	it's also 100 percent due to creed's hubris, which is far more prominent prior to CREED than his greatness 
AdamSerwer	703364523449819136	2016-02-26T23:42:24	Apollo is black. Drago beats him. Am I the only person who has seen this movie? 
AdamSerwer	703364045697638400	2016-02-26T23:40:31	Not mutually exclusive. It's his arrogance that leads him to believe he can defeat Drago. classic hubris 
AdamSerwer	703363850104602624	2016-02-26T23:39:44	In Rocky IV Drago literally kills apollo in the ring, and in Rocky V Tommy Gunn destroys Union Cane in one round 
AdamSerwer	703363343701168128	2016-02-26T23:37:43	dude he literally murders apollo in the ring after he shows up dancing in front of a golden calf 
AdamSerwer	703363070861709313	2016-02-26T23:36:38	Also the hand work is great. You don't know how hard it is to hit those pads accurately that fast until you've tried it.
AdamSerwer	703362929408741376	2016-02-26T23:36:04	Creed is basically an apology for the first six rocky movies, all of which feature a white boxer humbling a black man in the ring

AdamSerwer	688176551255379971	2016-01-16T01:50:50	theseantcollins HeerJeet yes--all corrupted by the weak democratic leaders and their failure to see batman is above judgement
AdamSerwer	688176328118419457	2016-01-16T01:49:56	theseantcollins HeerJeet But it's really Reagan and superman that seals it. Superman is beneath contempt because he submits to democracy

AdamSerwer	688175766496882688	2016-01-16T01:47:43	theseantcollins HeerJeet I don't see too many of those tbh

AdamSerwer	688174106001276930	2016-01-16T01:41:07	theseantcollins HeerJeet they're a uniformed group of paramilitary fanatics under the command of a single, unaccountable person
AdamSerwer	688173815768039425	2016-01-16T01:39:57	theseantcollins HeerJeet all superhero comic books contain vigilantism, they don't all contain indictments of democratic society

AdamSerwer	688170434269847552	2016-01-16T01:26:31	HeerJeet theseantcollins there is a monologue in which Gordon explicitly argues that a head of state is beyond judgement by normals
AdamSerwer	688170229185118208	2016-01-16T01:25:42	HeerJeet theseantcollins It's mussolinis case against democracy: corrupt, weak, unable to solve modern problems.

AdamSerwer	688158627333410817	2016-01-16T00:39:36	You might think this is a joke, but the point of DKR is that democracies are weak and can't solve problems unlike authoritarian strongmen
