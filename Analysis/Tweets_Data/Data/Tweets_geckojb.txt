geckojb	685847537383772160	2016-01-09T15:36:10	IvanTheK hmeisler So whats the contrarian call here? Is this a bullish cover or bearish?  I read it as bearish.
geckojb	685554344507359233	2016-01-08T20:11:07	Its going to take a crowbar and backhoe to heave the NDQ off the ledge but should it rollover then things will get really interesting QQQ
geckojb	685488356776607744	2016-01-08T15:48:54	BobBrinker agree but, maybe too many are waiting for capitulation it seems.
geckojb	685487346498846720	2016-01-08T15:44:53	BobBrinker Yes very orderly week long  slow crash.
geckojb	685487200205684736	2016-01-08T15:44:18	If this volatility squeeze actually goes off to the downside for IWM its going to be brutal.
geckojb	685486997683699713	2016-01-08T15:43:30	SPY still a long way away from its 23.6% 2009 retrace level.
geckojb	685486770163740672	2016-01-08T15:42:36	IWM hits 23.6% Fib retrace off 2009 bottom.  Very reasonable pull back thus far.  See no reason why it cant go to 38.2%.
geckojb	685149041802539008	2016-01-07T17:20:35	Would not surprise me to see Indexes 15-20% lower from here in next 12-18 mos based on rounding chart and SmCap breakdown. IWM SPY
geckojb	685148645042307072	2016-01-07T17:19:01	Now that were all negative, where is the surprise trade? Think a larger move down or up is probably it. Odds suggest new level is much lower
geckojb	685148185552109569	2016-01-07T17:17:11	hmeisler Plenty that decided the declining internals meant little.  Which in a QE world probably didn't like the low vol of past few yrs
geckojb	685147852742459392	2016-01-07T17:15:52	hmeisler agurevich23 Those that saw the declining internals from 2q last yr and concluded it was not good are being rewarded.
geckojb	685147227346612224	2016-01-07T17:13:23	agurevich23 hmeisler hard for a TA to remain with a bull thesis when almost every chart is pointing down at this point.
geckojb	685144165919899648	2016-01-07T17:01:13	Reason that Prfrds and Munis doing so well here is yield chasers leaving HYB looking for something. These should get hit as well PGX MUB
geckojb	684804133862424576	2016-01-06T18:30:03	If you recall the last volatility signal I shared started to blow out in August of 2015 on SPX
geckojb	684803871588413440	2016-01-06T18:29:00	I hate to say this but a large volatility squeeze on the weekly time frame is about to blow out on small caps - not good. iWM
geckojb	684005293278146560	2016-01-04T13:35:44	so morning consensus is not to worry about morning selloff.  Everyone's noombers tell them we should be allright... I smell complacency.
geckojb	679688966124130305	2015-12-23T15:44:12	mikeharrisNY I think the naive momo already has been arbitraged out and those simple momo strategies u have done  a good job over past yr
geckojb	679688579241529344	2015-12-23T15:42:39	mikeharrisNY..which probably has more of an impact on range mkt than momo does tho I do think its being overused but differ on impact.
geckojb	679687971818225665	2015-12-23T15:40:15	mikeharrisNY What about FANG?  about 1966-1982 range mkt?  You cant ignore mkt structure skewed today by HFT,ZIRP,QE which...
geckojb	679662896373043202	2015-12-23T14:00:36	mikeharrisNY in 1sentence you said momo drove LC stock val higher but mean reversion kept selling stocks.  examples of this are?
geckojb	679662172683649025	2015-12-23T13:57:44	mikeharrisNY interesting theory but imho you didnt prove your point.  Range bound mkt could be due to any of numerous factors.
geckojb	677929909738741761	2015-12-18T19:14:20	TLT close to breakout, stock indexes close to new breakdowns SPY IWM.  Who blinks first.  getting interesting.
