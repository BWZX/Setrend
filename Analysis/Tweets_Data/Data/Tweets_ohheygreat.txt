ohheygreat	721869167402426369	2016-04-18T01:13:15	jesshopp what would the world be like if men assumed expertise in women and asked before "teaching" them stuff?
ohheygreat	721868245620232193	2016-04-18T01:09:36	Today my yoga teacher said something I would very much like to share with you:   "Get out of your 'what the fuck' zone."
ohheygreat	721867921010483200	2016-04-18T01:08:18	KuraFire I think we are definitely in accord, but perhaps the wording of gone original question and its timing could be reconsidered.
ohheygreat	721867687224160256	2016-04-18T01:07:22	KuraFire your intent was "we need to think about how product affects our behavior!" but it comes across as slightly lacking in empathy.
ohheygreat	721867303155945472	2016-04-18T01:05:51	KuraFire I agree with that very much but would like to gently point out that your first tweet with me was to say "why limit it to people."
ohheygreat	721841387562348545	2016-04-17T23:22:52	KuraFire the people question is the fundamental question you should ask in product design.
ohheygreat	721841003531935744	2016-04-17T23:21:21	KuraFire also interesting: you arguing for prod design to change behavior by responding to my tweets about a troll &amp; saying I don't get it.
ohheygreat	721840429117800449	2016-04-17T23:19:04	KuraFire Yeah, and I agree completely. I just think the way you put it misses this nuance.
ohheygreat	721840148883714048	2016-04-17T23:17:57	KuraFire Faruk, I get it. It's technological determinism.
ohheygreat	721836702797406208	2016-04-17T23:04:15	KuraFire Yes, I get it, product design can make acting out harder or more difficult and should but product design doesn‚Äôt erase the desire.
ohheygreat	721836439130890241	2016-04-17T23:03:12	KuraFire Because while related, there is a difference between social/institutional structures and a human desire to act out bad feelings.
ohheygreat	721820444647489536	2016-04-17T21:59:39	Also interesting: the people who have made jokes in response to any of this are men.
ohheygreat	721807279033417728	2016-04-17T21:07:20	mslopatto thanks friend &lt;3
ohheygreat	721798333715513345	2016-04-17T20:31:47	What I find most fascinating about all this is, as with everything online, reading me on twitter+ Verge + instagram is TOTALLY OPTIONAL.
ohheygreat	721792490106302465	2016-04-17T20:08:34	aegies You can‚Äôt request verification, and I‚Äôm not a verge employee so I probably won‚Äôt get it!
ohheygreat	721792145393201152	2016-04-17T20:07:12	KuraFire I think you‚Äôre expecting a lot from a product. A product can impact or constrain behavior but technology can‚Äôt fix human behavior.

ohheygreat	721790729937223680	2016-04-17T20:01:34	KuraFire Because people will do this no matter what technology you create. Fixing one product is necessary but won‚Äôt solve everything.
ohheygreat	721788840571080704	2016-04-17T19:54:04	And again, an account made specifically to tweet at me. I feel genuinely sad for whoever this is.

ohheygreat	721752755539345409	2016-04-17T17:30:41	SStormes Shoseki Yeah this seems to be rooted in a vast misunderstanding you have around empathy.

ohheygreat	721749569759944704	2016-04-17T17:18:01	the end of this conversation is so satisfying to me

ohheygreat	705864628534792192	2016-03-04T21:16:56	lil_mermaid joshgondelman RachelFersh yes please
ohheygreat	705864599384358912	2016-03-04T21:16:49	RachelFersh joshgondelman Agreed! I also feel someone asking to pick my brain without really explaining why never seems nice to me.
ohheygreat	705864314721140736	2016-03-04T21:15:41	I SWEAR I'M NOT A JERK (MOST OF THE TIME)
ohheygreat	705864266687991808	2016-03-04T21:15:30	Ugh this came out wrong. I didn't mean "offer as a favor" but in the conversation. Like "hey! THIS SPECIFIC THING is why I'm reaching out."
ohheygreat	705863894993117184	2016-03-04T21:14:01	joshgondelman RachelFersh totally. Gah I feel like I explained this wrong and now I look like a jerk.
ohheygreat	705863387381563392	2016-03-04T21:12:00	RachelFersh Totally, or asks me to make time so they can pick my brain.

ohheygreat	705863112889479168	2016-03-04T21:10:55	joshgondelman Like when someone wants to "pick your brain" (yuck) they're asking for your time AND expertise. Which is great!
ohheygreat	705862873587712000	2016-03-04T21:09:58	joshgondelman Oh totally. I'm not summarizing this well ‚Äì not like, hey I'll do you a favor, but "hey I bring these things to the convo!"
ohheygreat	705862227895517184	2016-03-04T21:07:24	joshgondelman (especially if you are asking a stranger)
ohheygreat	705862132512878592	2016-03-04T21:07:01	joshgondelman oh yes! and it was good. Like, hey, we all need help but asking for something is better if you can offer something in return!
ohheygreat	705861912727130113	2016-03-04T21:06:08	joshgondelman also the answer to this is yes, EVERYTHING is a thing.
ohheygreat	705861832490135552	2016-03-04T21:05:49	joshgondelman which, the piece or people just asking for help/mentorship out of the blue
ohheygreat	705861477446496256	2016-03-04T21:04:25	Hey, who wrote the piece about reaching out for help/mentorship by telling the person what you can offer, not just what they can do for you?
