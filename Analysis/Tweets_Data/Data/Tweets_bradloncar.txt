bradloncar	715303888962908162	2016-03-30T22:25:11	adamsinger It might matter where you ride as well. Would be interesting to know if drivers in certain places naturally have a tougher scale

bradloncar	715279956050362368	2016-03-30T20:50:05	WilliamGerber1 BioBounce Just because those senators have (wrongly) singled out MDVN as a symbol of greed, and now there's a bidding war?

bradloncar	703229210517569536	2016-02-26T14:44:43	I thought B’Berg did a questionable job of matching their title to a specific quote from Dr. Woodcock in this story.

bradloncar	697858433115168768	2016-02-11T19:03:10	bradloncar not the first, probably won't be the last: 
bradloncar	697858032898744320	2016-02-11T19:01:35	StevenEdelson biotechbaumer Filed under the category of “life isn’t fair.” They still should price the options at the higher price, IMO.
bradloncar	697856033553645568	2016-02-11T18:53:38	zzlangerhans No doubt, sadly.

bradloncar	697589248753446912	2016-02-11T01:13:32	pearlf arthurklausner I guess that’s true. Still, I don’t think the options should be market at the low price they basically created.

bradloncar	693854478139654144	2016-01-31T17:52:53	WilliamGerber1 There was one day last year (Aug 24) where things seemed to have gone wrong for 15 minutes, but otherwise it's been smooth.
bradloncar	693853567631798272	2016-01-31T17:49:16	geneman10 But there is a market maker. It's just that they use factors other than demand to determine the spread.
bradloncar	693853283715141632	2016-01-31T17:48:08	geneman10 Correct...the bid/ask does not reflect demand for the ETF. There are ETFs that trade &lt;1000 shares a day that have deep liquidity.
bradloncar	693851799543898112	2016-01-31T17:42:14	geneman10 The tighter the bid/ask of all the underlying holdings, the tighter the bid/ask of the ETF itself will be.
bradloncar	693851444286390276	2016-01-31T17:40:50	PDRennert ...throughout the day at that price to meet any demand so heavy buying doesn't move the ETF up, for example.
bradloncar	693851166002679808	2016-01-31T17:39:43	PDRennert Because the value of the ETF is determined by the value of its underlying holdings. Market makers can create new shares...
bradloncar	693849054199951360	2016-01-31T17:31:20	Also, buying &amp; selling doesn't move ETFs like it does stocks. ETFs stay near the intrinsic value of underlying holdings regardless of volume
bradloncar	693847635984146433	2016-01-31T17:25:42	The liquidity of an ETF is related to the liquidity of its underlying stocks. A $1M fund can accept a $100M trade if they are plenty liquid.
bradloncar	693846581791993857	2016-01-31T17:21:30	This is hands down the best explainer of ETF liquidity I've read. For example, it has no relation to trading volume.

bradloncar	688070381421203456	2016-01-15T18:48:57	geneman10 Yea that part is frustrating. Consumer sentiment was released this morning, for example, and it’s at a 7 month high.
bradloncar	688069310703521792	2016-01-15T18:44:42	alpbugrabasat That’s the perfect word. I expect approval as well but the history has been too suspicious to bet on it.

bradloncar	688068945094381568	2016-01-15T18:43:14	geneman10 I think money is coming out of the capital markets and we’re more sensitive to it than others b/c we always need to raise money.
bradloncar	688068630425149440	2016-01-15T18:41:59	invstmirabilis Yep…over the short term we are at the mercy of the capital markets. Over the long-term innovation is the driver.

bradloncar	688064567214129152	2016-01-15T18:25:51	propthinker That’s right. It’s the lens that we view it through.
bradloncar	688063912042872833	2016-01-15T18:23:14	95% of this has nothing to do with biotech specifically. We’d be down probably the same whether JPM16 happened or not.
bradloncar	688063085265866752	2016-01-15T18:19:57	Today (and this year) stinks in every way possible, but I do think it is being overblown how much this is about biotech specifically.
bradloncar	688057234366922753	2016-01-15T17:56:42	billy_jacob Interesting…I didn’t see it. Has there been any news, or is it just a random bounce?
