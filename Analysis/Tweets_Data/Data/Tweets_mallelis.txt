mallelis	725554237912928256	2016-04-28T05:16:25	mallelis When not your own cat (as in our case), it can be a little unnerving. I walk 2 dogs at night and neighbor cat stalks us.

mallelis	719413915524984833	2016-04-11T06:36:58	I am then treated to a story about how they met at a McDonald's that is very short and is really only "we met at McDonald's in 1993"
mallelis	719413598989262849	2016-04-11T06:35:42	His wife cackles and says "I knew that when I was 13, get with it, man!"  I have been here 37 minutes.
mallelis	719413394080665601	2016-04-11T06:34:53	I say "it's fine" to which he says "FINE just stands for FUCKED UP, INSECURE, NEUROTIC, and ERROR-PRONE"
mallelis	719412752750682112	2016-04-11T06:32:20	They unstick themselves from one another and I hand him my card "sorry about this. I haven't worked at McDonald's in 16 years" he says

mallelis	719412465067560960	2016-04-11T06:31:12	I pull around and they are fucking making out in the window and he has his thumb out like he is aware I will be driving up to this
mallelis	719412246493970433	2016-04-11T06:30:20	"Give me the extra pie"  "She says thank you"  "Tell her I said no problem"  Why am I talking to his wife like this why
mallelis	719411841663774720	2016-04-11T06:28:43	"What is the discount?"  "2 apple pies for only 2 dollars. You should take it."  (Note: One apple pie is $1.19)
mallelis	719411412221734912	2016-04-11T06:27:01	So he says "your total is 8 HOLD ON my wife is here and she wants me to tell you she will sell you 2 apple pies at a discount"
mallelis	719411185968365568	2016-04-11T06:26:07	"Can you give me my total" I say because honestly I don't know if I want to understand his marriage or if I even could and I just want to go
mallelis	719410799719092225	2016-04-11T06:24:35	At this point I have ordered a chicken sandwich I do not want and an apple pie I do not want and no milkshake and I've been here 22 minutes
mallelis	719410525227065344	2016-04-11T06:23:29	"What? Who did you find?"  "MY WIFE. SHE WAS WATCHING ME FROM BEHIND THE BOXES!"

mallelis	715240719489888256	2016-03-30T18:14:10	mallelis Almost a year. Kept waiting for him to say it first, like a dink.
mallelis	715240747423805440	2016-03-30T18:14:17	mallelis current relationship we waited about a year. But we are old and have been Burned By Love in the past. 3 years later very happy.
mallelis	715240802079928321	2016-03-30T18:14:30	mallelis Eight months.
mallelis	715240870082060288	2016-03-30T18:14:46	mallelis 4 months. I got out of a long relationship and didn't want to confuse excitement for love and have to take it back
mallelis	715240907713462272	2016-03-30T18:14:55	mallelis Both times (with guys) I only held out two months. Could hardly keep from blurting it out.
mallelis	715243991378173954	2016-03-30T18:27:10	the important thing is that we all end up feeling like we've done something wrong DrewFoxJordan
mallelis	715240910892699648	2016-03-30T18:14:56	mallelis I can't wait to read all the responses to this and feel incredibly self conscious about all my decisions!
mallelis	715241381266989057	2016-03-30T18:16:48	mallelis I don't think I've ever said it to any of them. There have only been three though with the longest one being a year and a half?
mallelis	715243807856398338	2016-03-30T18:26:27	lizrawr not at all
mallelis	715241546396737536	2016-03-30T18:17:27	mallelis two years has been...actually kind of my standard. But my romantic relationships have been pretty non-traditional.
mallelis	715241652164685825	2016-03-30T18:17:53	mallelis well HE said it after two months &amp; I said it two months after that because I jokingly said "I hate you" and then panicked
mallelis	715242307423895552	2016-03-30T18:20:29	mallelis a little over a year
mallelis	715240251145388033	2016-03-30T18:12:19	okay now I'm curious: what's the longest you've waited to say 'I love you' in a romantic relationship

mallelis	709060673330749440	2016-03-13T16:56:52	I open the door. Jason Statham is not looking happy. Too fucking bad; you should not send a bald man in all black to rouse anyone from bed.
mallelis	709060487749574656	2016-03-13T16:56:08	I gaze at the schedule, clear as damnit. "4:35 pickup. 6:35 flight." No am. No pm. MILITARY TIME.
mallelis	709060251723571204	2016-03-13T16:55:12	"She, er, she's from the festival? Seemed quite sure she was to pick you up at 4:30." Ah, my friends. The scales, from my eyes, they fall.
mallelis	709060004989415424	2016-03-13T16:54:13	This nervous woman is clearly his accomplice! MY flight is not until 6:30. I tell him so.
mallelis	709059854539698176	2016-03-13T16:53:37	Reception says, "Yes, we, ah, sent him up? There's someone here waiting to take you to the airport? She's quite worried?" Well.
mallelis	709059698872324096	2016-03-13T16:53:00	"Hey, there's a man at my door," I say, the end of that sentence clearly being, "COME COLLECT HIM, I don't want him."
mallelis	709059534325567488	2016-03-13T16:52:21	Well, he keeps knocking but not explaining anything, which clearly confirms his murderous intent. I call reception to clear this up.
mallelis	709058220778606592	2016-03-13T16:47:08	He keeps mumbling something about reception I can't make out. Sir, I have seen action movies. You are here to kill my body. I don't open it.
mallelis	709058021033267200	2016-03-13T16:46:20	Motherfucker, I've seen this movie. I'm not expecting to hear from reception at 5 in god's morning. I bolt the door. "What do you want?"
mallelis	709057749426941952	2016-03-13T16:45:15	Some Jason-Statham-looking dude is on the other end of the door. "Reception," he mumbles. "I'm from reception." Oh, hell no.
mallelis	709057414163632128	2016-03-13T16:43:55	Jolts me up out of a dead sleep. I'm confused. Not happy to be awake. Go to the door. "Who is it?"

mallelis	702957536635441152	2016-02-25T20:45:11	Also-- he eats wings funny so no.
mallelis	702956727919050752	2016-02-25T20:41:58	And I don't think I can deal with someone so oblivious. He's now on a countdown.

mallelis	702955784850821120	2016-02-25T20:38:14	He asks me if it normally takes so long, all APPLECARE loud.
mallelis	702955522920734724	2016-02-25T20:37:11	Anyway. We finally get our food &amp; Mercury makes a big show of checking our order before we leave. 🙄😐

mallelis	702954216399175681	2016-02-25T20:32:00	I ask the lady about our order number. I'm talking very southern &amp; deferential. She's older.
mallelis	702953945430421505	2016-02-25T20:30:55	In this case, acting white = I WAS TOLD BY APPLECARE.
mallelis	702953785392496641	2016-02-25T20:30:17	So Mercury stands next to me. In my head, I'm like "please don't act white about this."

mallelis	702953339949080576	2016-02-25T20:28:31	We realize the lady didn't give us an order number so I go up to the counter to ask about it &amp; my white companion stands next to me.

mallelis	702952709893332992	2016-02-25T20:26:00	Then our food took hella long. Longest wait I've ever had there. Every time I look in the kitchen, black dude is staring at me.
mallelis	702952091770290177	2016-02-25T20:23:33	But I looked in the kitchen (open plan) &amp; a black man was stabbing me with his eyes. Oh boy.
mallelis	702951762903310337	2016-02-25T20:22:15	We get there. The lady who took our order was really nice &amp; sweet. Joked with us. It was all good.
mallelis	702951441200246784	2016-02-25T20:20:58	Before we went there, I did caution the spot was a hole-in-the-wall &amp; in a black neighborhood, hoping to prepare him. He was like cool.
mallelis	702951079642853376	2016-02-25T20:19:32	Nothing major happened but he was so oblivious to everything in that "color blind" way and yeah, no.
