sjwrenlewis	711606375101628416	2016-03-20T17:32:35	GrkStav Because at least what I have read does not use mainstream macro framework, and the translation is (to me at least) opaque.

sjwrenlewis	711575753234784258	2016-03-20T15:30:54	alexxdouglas NCowenUK GrkStav wbmosler The same as saying that money creates unemployment because can only then have lack of agg demand?
