RaoulGMI	717138120769216512	2016-04-04T23:53:46	czajkowski_john I don't know I'm afraid. They are with the production  team
RaoulGMI	717005996414078976	2016-04-04T15:08:45	GainsPainsCapit Lags ISM perfect by 24 months so will turn lower shortly.
RaoulGMI	716989295362486272	2016-04-04T14:02:23	georgepearkes That is what happened in 2007... hence why I still dont know if ISM is 1998 or 2007/8
RaoulGMI	716988980303110145	2016-04-04T14:01:08	WorthWray Agree they have shifted rather quickly
RaoulGMI	716988576718831616	2016-04-04T13:59:32	nauernotmauer WorthWray Thanks.
RaoulGMI	716956587240374272	2016-04-04T11:52:25	WorthWray Let's see what develops... time will tell.
RaoulGMI	716956010808782848	2016-04-04T11:50:08	joshuademasi Im talking about the ISM movements, just to be clear. Nothing else.
RaoulGMI	716955796207230976	2016-04-04T11:49:16	georgepearkes No change but acknowledge the probability shift and am watching closely. A bounce is normal but a bounce over 50 less so.
RaoulGMI	716951827795849216	2016-04-04T11:33:30	JamesGRickards petermcoyne Thx. There might be evidence of a tacit agreement to be mindful but somewhat different to a Plaza-style accord.
RaoulGMI	716951004089094144	2016-04-04T11:30:14	WorthWray That is HUGELY different to a Plaza Accord agreement. Thats a tacit "lets be mindful".
RaoulGMI	716950270681485313	2016-04-04T11:27:19	georgepearkes Always tough to know at this point if its 1998 and that was a short downcycle or 2008 when it was just a bounce. Watching...
RaoulGMI	716782176193404929	2016-04-04T00:19:22	bvincent23 Sureshsinghn Yes, its certainly probably but not my most likely outcome as US was growing at 4.5% in 1998.
RaoulGMI	716780582068490240	2016-04-04T00:13:02	LeederOfThePack GRoberts770 JamesGRickards Doesnt mean I cant be wrong but Im definitely not wrong yet!
RaoulGMI	716780167977418752	2016-04-04T00:11:23	DaveHcontrarian Why would Japan or EU want a stronger currency? Isnt that the same effect as a deval vs China? Doesnt add up in my mind...
RaoulGMI	716779942529409024	2016-04-04T00:10:30	LeederOfThePack My guess is that they talked about NIRP and decided it might not work as well as hoped but nothing much more than that.
RaoulGMI	716779821481738240	2016-04-04T00:10:01	LeederOfThePack Because it didnt work so he'll buy assets instead.
RaoulGMI	716779722764656640	2016-04-04T00:09:37	LeederOfThePack US Atlanta Fed GDP now is at 0.6%...
RaoulGMI	716779636022185984	2016-04-04T00:09:17	LeederOfThePack More cuts? They are at -40bps right now! We cant expect much more yet...

RaoulGMI	716758467684528128	2016-04-03T22:45:10	KOpulskis no, Schumpter but it doesn't cover modern indicators etc that you can use now.
RaoulGMI	716750650298789888	2016-04-03T22:14:06	KOpulskis Sadly, I dont know of one that is modern.

RaoulGMI	716726485478936577	2016-04-03T20:38:04	cmultrading nauernotmauer yes... Everyone gets it.
RaoulGMI	716719823246516224	2016-04-03T20:11:36	Sureshsinghn Yes, agreed. Question if its temporary a la 2008 or something more like 1998... this is what keeps me awake.
RaoulGMI	716718111257411588	2016-04-03T20:04:48	nauernotmauer Even better, you'll see my GMI Monthly as part of the research package offer...
RaoulGMI	716715279435309056	2016-04-03T19:53:33	Also, while Im on the subject of the $. There is zero factual evidence of any Plaza Accord style agreement in Shanghai....all just noise.

RaoulGMI	716599814214000640	2016-04-03T12:14:44	addictiondocMD ttmygh RealVisionTV Good question. 10% is an urban myth... asset allocations depend on probabilistic outcomes.
RaoulGMI	716599556197236736	2016-04-03T12:13:42	ttmygh addictiondocMD RealVisionTV agree. Also depends what is going on... sometimes you'll want huge allocation and other times little.
RaoulGMI	716582924745883648	2016-04-03T11:07:37	addictiondocMD ttmygh RealVisionTV And it depends on what is going on. Its an asset so invest in it as such.
RaoulGMI	716582769757929472	2016-04-03T11:07:00	addictiondocMD ttmygh RealVisionTV the usual answer is 10% but why that #? No idea. My view is you either want v little or a LOT..
RaoulGMI	716451870043148288	2016-04-03T02:26:51	addictiondocMD ttmygh yes, whatever you are comfortable with... It's your choice.

RaoulGMI	714825600498683904	2016-03-29T14:44:38	bvincent23 A bit 50:50. Im concerned that narrative is already the pervasive Group Think and positions reflect that

RaoulGMI	714811486485549056	2016-03-29T13:48:33	KOpulskis certainly possible. Credit spreads usually follows ISM pretty closely so ISM needs to weaken.
RaoulGMI	714810431517421573	2016-03-29T13:44:22	While everyone was focussed on growth and inflation, the Atlanta Fed fell to 0.6%. If it breaks here, its all over

RaoulGMI	704104879757860864	2016-02-29T00:44:19	Bamabroker AdamBScott1979 can you see the SPX divergence going back several years?

RaoulGMI	704101409386586112	2016-02-29T00:30:32	Bamabroker AdamBScott1979 I'm not sure I see such big divergence. Look at SPX weekly for last 5 years. That was big divergence!
RaoulGMI	704101137578856450	2016-02-29T00:29:27	AdamBScott1979 Bamabroker fair point. I've used that correlation for last 2 years and it's worked well as a framework thus far.

RaoulGMI	695213564018188288	2016-02-04T11:53:24	creditmacro Macronomics1 exactly... as these trade like reverse converts in some respect.
RaoulGMI	695213258597208064	2016-02-04T11:52:11	RScubism nicoffx As far as I understand. Its all about proximity to strike, and CoCo holders are essentially short snyth' downside options
RaoulGMI	695212731180298240	2016-02-04T11:50:06	creditmacro Macronomics1 Thanks. Again, I think as a CoCo holder, all downside would require stock sales to hedge the event risk
RaoulGMI	695212454641467393	2016-02-04T11:49:00	Macronomics1 creditmacro Exactly, hence the negative gamma element for CoCo holders hedging strike risk via equity. Thus selling increases

RaoulGMI	694908337767505920	2016-02-03T15:40:33	Sorry, thinking aloud. So if the ECB figures out the toxicity of CoCo death spiral then ECB QE will be buying the CoCos from the market??
RaoulGMI	694907604619935744	2016-02-03T15:37:38	moved_average Exactly. only way to hedge that is shorting the stock.
RaoulGMI	694907504459956224	2016-02-03T15:37:14	michaellebowitz roughly, or the bond impairs but the way to hedge it is shorting the stock, so net, net, its the same thing.
RaoulGMI	694907354287075328	2016-02-03T15:36:38	Oval54 Exactly.

RaoulGMI	694876821192581120	2016-02-03T13:35:19	MiaChupacabra Macronomics1 Yeah, but arent they inter linked essentially?
RaoulGMI	694874897869377536	2016-02-03T13:27:40	nicoffx Great. So the very bond that was to fix banks Cap ratios and shore them up is the very thing that puts them into the death spiral?
RaoulGMI	694873948903833600	2016-02-03T13:23:54	nicoffx So, Lets say I am put into the equity as a CoCo holder I now need to hedge or sell it, if I fear market falling more?
RaoulGMI	694873561790574592	2016-02-03T13:22:21	Macronomics1 but the key is that you get put into stock in a falling market? i.e neg gamma? These were toxic in 2001, hence the Q's
RaoulGMI	694871395810025472	2016-02-03T13:13:45	Macronomics1 Sorry, asking a few people the same Q's.: Is this similar to the Reverse Conerts from the mid to late 1990's?
RaoulGMI	694871209633280000	2016-02-03T13:13:01	Hubon nicoffx PrometheusAM That was my fear. They are negative gamma trades essentially?
RaoulGMI	694871018419130368	2016-02-03T13:12:15	nicoffx These sounds like the Reverse Convertibles of the mid - late 90's. Essentially negative gamma instruments in falling markets?

RaoulGMI	694192013269471232	2016-02-01T16:14:08	Bigjdiddy Great chart!
RaoulGMI	694191926363447296	2016-02-01T16:13:47	cmultrading Fed stopping QE was the spark, the rest is the weakness caused by the strong $ and carry unwind
RaoulGMI	694191705457848321	2016-02-01T16:12:54	Stevephenni They dont get a choice, as they didnt in early 80's or late 90's
RaoulGMI	694191605956415490	2016-02-01T16:12:30	MarkYusko Clearly it is possible but less probable. That happened after the Plaza Accord when dollar reversed. Way too early for that..IMO
RaoulGMI	694177668753850372	2016-02-01T15:17:08	chewy8286 Quite possible...
RaoulGMI	694177606011375616	2016-02-01T15:16:53	TheVolawatcher michaellebowitz I disagree. When the Fed cuts the rest of the world is worse. That is the nature of a $ bull market.
RaoulGMI	694176518528987136	2016-02-01T15:12:33	But to be clear, it would not surprise me to have a larger correction at some point. But no correction in any $ bull mkt has been &gt; 10%.
RaoulGMI	694176107952762881	2016-02-01T15:10:55	DaveHcontrarian Definitely possible and everyone appears to be a weak holder of dollars as they expect a reversal on Fed dovishness.
RaoulGMI	694175807925784576	2016-02-01T15:09:44	zabolots As they did in early 1980's and early 990's...that was the spark that started it.
RaoulGMI	694175574751891456	2016-02-01T15:08:48	furg2000 None of us have faith in the long run, history tells us that...
RaoulGMI	694175442719391744	2016-02-01T15:08:17	michaeltg As it always is in a big bull market but how long until it turns? Much further than here, in my view.
RaoulGMI	694175304693256196	2016-02-01T15:07:44	michaellebowitz Nah, it will rally if they are cutting, thats my point and where I seem to differ
RaoulGMI	694175127039283200	2016-02-01T15:07:02	from_10000ft Agree.
RaoulGMI	694175059016032256	2016-02-01T15:06:45	DavidBCollum Yup.
RaoulGMI	694174877461381120	2016-02-01T15:06:02	platosbunker Rates went from 6% to 4.5%, not hue cuts but cuts never the less.
RaoulGMI	694174585802117120	2016-02-01T15:04:53	siasees This time its the $ carry trade
RaoulGMI	694172567863726082	2016-02-01T14:56:51	gaurav_jalan Exactly.
RaoulGMI	694167778664845312	2016-02-01T14:37:50	Back in early 80's $ bull and late 90's the Fed cut rates all the way through and the $ rose sharply. That is the history of $ bull markets.
RaoulGMI	694167588230807553	2016-02-01T14:37:04	I seem to be the only person who thinks that the $ bull markets keeps going for another year or two. I find that interesting (or Im wrong!)
RaoulGMI	694167333326213120	2016-02-01T14:36:03	visigoth67 Shocking!
RaoulGMI	694167304108687361	2016-02-01T14:35:56	76MBlank yes, I do. No one else seems to., which is surprising.
RaoulGMI	694152388903575556	2016-02-01T13:36:40	johnkass48 probably just dollar bull market and a weakening economy and big deficits

RaoulGMI	684108435806359552	2016-01-04T20:25:35	JonKirkpatrick Yes, twitter is not easy. consensus is $ reverses and is thus weak in a weak economy.
RaoulGMI	684108174220197889	2016-01-04T20:24:33	teasri Macronomics1 Exactly.
RaoulGMI	684088845651021825	2016-01-04T19:07:45	Oval54 equities initially, most likely...animal spirits are still rampant there.
RaoulGMI	684087916436533248	2016-01-04T19:04:03	DaveHcontrarian Agreed. probably 2017, if this weakness persists or worsens in global economy, which is my base case.
RaoulGMI	684087687704383492	2016-01-04T19:03:09	Oval54 From what? growth? inflation? default? none of those is going to happen in the next 24 months or so.
RaoulGMI	684087470166786048	2016-01-04T19:02:17	BruceWarrenGunn It will not invert. It will trade down to 50bps at best. 1.20 is the new zero under ZIRP (or as good as).
RaoulGMI	684087267099602944	2016-01-04T19:01:28	PrometheusAM @AxGlobalAdv Sure, its an opaque world so we have to filter what is important and test it until it doesnt work.
RaoulGMI	684087028510801920	2016-01-04T19:00:31	Oval54 Vol adjusted, no, probably not.
RaoulGMI	684086911363870721	2016-01-04T19:00:04	cmultrading Nice try...
RaoulGMI	684086804807553024	2016-01-04T18:59:38	johnkass48 Sadly not....
RaoulGMI	684086670375956481	2016-01-04T18:59:06	JonKirkpatrick That is by far and away the biggest consensus on the dollar. It may happen but in 2017, or 2018.
RaoulGMI	684086480126513152	2016-01-04T18:58:21	RPhuket Appreciate it. Why a clown call, out of interest?
RaoulGMI	684079289344634881	2016-01-04T18:29:46	TheVolawatcher and a source of returns.
RaoulGMI	684079125322199041	2016-01-04T18:29:07	@AxGlobalAdv The $ is bigger than the Fed. It is the worlds reserve currency and there are $9,5trn in carry trade debts.
RaoulGMI	684078956409143297	2016-01-04T18:28:27	KlendathuCap Umm... very.
RaoulGMI	684078838406615040	2016-01-04T18:27:59	I think the big surprise this year will be the strength of the bond market... 10 years are likely to go to 1.2%
RaoulGMI	684071478422290432	2016-01-04T17:58:44	@AxGlobalAdv A year since the $ broke out. Usually last 4 to 7 years.
RaoulGMI	684071114881036288	2016-01-04T17:57:17	joshuademasi It works well at capturing GDP, similar to CESI and ISM. So its a factor but not all of it. Need multi-factors. ISM is biggest
RaoulGMI	684070882269093888	2016-01-04T17:56:22	Halsrethink Yes, we've been on the same track for a while now.
RaoulGMI	684070763633242113	2016-01-04T17:55:54	@AxGlobalAdv Yes, but carry trade unwind will push the dollar and not so much rate differentials. Currencies trend for long periods.
RaoulGMI	684070409889824768	2016-01-04T17:54:29	ml8_ml8 It is cyclical.
RaoulGMI	684070336917311488	2016-01-04T17:54:12	Bloomberg DXY (broader index than DXY)... lift off about to occur...lower chance of rate hikes or not. 
RaoulGMI	684069991180812288	2016-01-04T17:52:49	timohotti haha... 1998 is still the fear card but S&amp;P still fell 22% then.
RaoulGMI	684069705632591873	2016-01-04T17:51:41	GregorMacdonald Whodda thought it?! ;-)
RaoulGMI	684069573184872448	2016-01-04T17:51:10	@AxGlobalAdv No rate hikes do not equal weak dollar. It is likely a false assumption which will likely be proven over time.
RaoulGMI	684069262571470848	2016-01-04T17:49:56	ml8_ml8 I've no idea as it would be unforecastable if random.
RaoulGMI	684068524793421825	2016-01-04T17:47:00	Well, with the Atlanta Fed at 0.7% and ISM at 48 and the Yield curve &lt;1.20 I think a recession is getting highly, highly likely.  odds &gt; 75%
