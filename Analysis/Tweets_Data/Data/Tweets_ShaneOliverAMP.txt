ShaneOliverAMP	712930203463499776	2016-03-24T09:13:00	beckyquick83 Yes - that is what I thought. Some countries even have a universal pension. We don't - its heavily means tested
ShaneOliverAMP	712929988203315200	2016-03-24T09:12:09	tomwestland Another complication is that transfers as %GDP don't tell us much about progressivity if Aust welfare system is highly targeted

ShaneOliverAMP	712892753525366785	2016-03-24T06:44:12	tomwestland True - although most are much smaller
ShaneOliverAMP	712892290994282499	2016-03-24T06:42:21	tomwestland I would think a bit more (super is 9% of wages)..maybe 5%pts
ShaneOliverAMP	712884982696579072	2016-03-24T06:13:19	tomwestland ..actually I think the low level for Aust is because it excludes super payments, whereas social sec is incl in US, Europe etc
ShaneOliverAMP	712879629439266817	2016-03-24T05:52:02	tomwestland Thanks - it does seem very low esp v US which is surprising.
ShaneOliverAMP	712879200747843584	2016-03-24T05:50:20	tomwestland Ok - now I think I get it :) ...but the statement was meant to go with the table as the table shows clear progressivity
ShaneOliverAMP	712878396951408641	2016-03-24T05:47:09	tomwestland I think it does - the table relates to groups and it shows the more earned the greater the tax share=progressivity!
ShaneOliverAMP	712878060123586560	2016-03-24T05:45:48	tomwestland It would be the same for groups, ie the more the group of taxpayers earn the greater the proportion they would pay in tax.

ShaneOliverAMP	712875701729370112	2016-03-24T05:36:26	tomwestland Why do you say transfers a low?
ShaneOliverAMP	712874876588199937	2016-03-24T05:33:09	tomwestland Its all in the table. The proportion paid in tax goes up the more you earn - thats progressivity..see the last column

ShaneOliverAMP	702358663374229504	2016-02-24T05:05:29	harryb2009 I don't think so. If we really want more affordable housing we can have it without a ST econ crash. But requires political will

ShaneOliverAMP	702357740753178628	2016-02-24T05:01:49	auspropertyscam harryb2009 Best to work on real solutions. Increase supply, decentralisation, etc rather than have a ST crash
ShaneOliverAMP	702357492139954176	2016-02-24T05:00:49	auspropertyscam harryb2009 See my reply. 30% + youth unemployment is not something to wish for!

ShaneOliverAMP	702356947367010311	2016-02-24T04:58:40	harryb2009 Thought you would say that! But such a fall would usually go hand in hand with deep recession, surge in unemp=big ST cost

ShaneOliverAMP	702351660991930369	2016-02-24T04:37:39	hawarden11 Agree its not that bad - high paying mining jobs (at least) being replaced by lower paying jobs, pulling down the average
