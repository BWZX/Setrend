MatthewBerryTMR	726207899928768513	2016-04-30T00:33:50	Gives NO size at WR in RZ that, other than Coleman, Saints don't really have.

MatthewBerryTMR	725903721771634688	2016-04-29T04:25:08	DAL is only team that's had a RB run for 1,000 yds while totaling 300 rec yards in consecutive seasons. They’ve done it 3 straight. zeke
MatthewBerryTMR	725900473786503168	2016-04-29T04:12:14	Hahaha. Fair.  
MatthewBerryTMR	725895782155608064	2016-04-29T03:53:35	Just throwing it out there, but could whoever hacked Tunsil's twitter been Becky with the good hair?
MatthewBerryTMR	725886282879127552	2016-04-29T03:15:50	brettperry_ I think Lynch has a legit chance to start
MatthewBerryTMR	725885312711401473	2016-04-29T03:11:59	One other point on Paxton...Great D, good run game...he doesn't need to do a lot for DEN to win. They can make it simple to start.
MatthewBerryTMR	725884160351559680	2016-04-29T03:07:24	We'll see who actually starts, but with Kubiak as coach &amp; those WR, Paxton Lynch lands in most fantasy friendly situation of 1st rd QB's
MatthewBerryTMR	725880368830795776	2016-04-29T02:52:20	100%. It's April. Just saying right now, w/ Reed, D Jax &amp; Garcon etc I don't see him having consistent fantasy value 
MatthewBerryTMR	725879796081762304	2016-04-29T02:50:04	Yeah, as a fan I am super psyched. 
MatthewBerryTMR	725878202342633472	2016-04-29T02:43:44	Our top rated receiver JoshDoctson love the pick. All business, worker, excellent hands Good pick Redskins

MatthewBerryTMR	725877707062546434	2016-04-29T02:41:46	Like the Doctson pick. With D Jax &amp; Garcon FA's after this year I can't see both back. At moment, no fantasy value this year tho.
MatthewBerryTMR	725872226139033600	2016-04-29T02:19:59	Read up on MikeClayNFL's fantasy analysis of Cleveland's newest speedster, Corey Coleman:

MatthewBerryTMR	725865791346888704	2016-04-29T01:54:25	Agreed 
MatthewBerryTMR	725865647540981760	2016-04-29T01:53:50	Tunsil a terrific pick for MIA. MIA O gonna be a lot better than folks think this year.

MatthewBerryTMR	713100371380584448	2016-03-24T20:29:11	Please, please let this not be true. Ugh. Love Shandling. So sad if this is... 
MatthewBerryTMR	713089630787268608	2016-03-24T19:46:31	Beadle!! Superhero movies, UFO's, the most epic dating advice ever &amp; much nonsense w/ MichelleDBeadle 
MatthewBerryTMR	713067039607357441	2016-03-24T18:16:45	So if Robert is the starter (obviously they can and probably will draft a QB) there is definitely potential fantasy upside there.
MatthewBerryTMR	713066283701518336	2016-03-24T18:13:44	That said....I'm a big Hue Jackson fan-he is a sharp offensive mind. And with Barnidge, hopefully Gordon, the RB..There IS talent there.
MatthewBerryTMR	713065934777409536	2016-03-24T18:12:21	Plus something to be said for going to a place where there is a front office &amp; coaching staff that has been there for a long time.
MatthewBerryTMR	713065680233431041	2016-03-24T18:11:20	Part of me wishes he had gone to a team that was further along talent wise, even if he had to be a backup.
MatthewBerryTMR	713065354013110272	2016-03-24T18:10:03	1st, as a fan of his, I'm happy RGIII found a team that seems excited to have him. And I would expect he will be the starter.
MatthewBerryTMR	713064807994359811	2016-03-24T18:07:52	Just out of taping a pod with MichelleDBeadle (posting today).... Bunch of thoughts on RG3....

MatthewBerryTMR	712274912950427648	2016-03-22T13:49:07	As mentioned in my Combine column, DAL did not believe in DMC as every down back. DMC back to 3rd down role. 1/2

MatthewBerryTMR	710292581549252611	2016-03-17T02:32:02	Yup.  
MatthewBerryTMR	710250931477151744	2016-03-16T23:46:32	Yeah, definitely like him for that 
MatthewBerryTMR	710249711047933952	2016-03-16T23:41:41	Exactly. Will have some huge games but not week to week. Count on Gronk, Edelman &amp; Dion Lewis in that O nxt yr.  
MatthewBerryTMR	710246630289772544	2016-03-16T23:29:27	evansilva Thanks, Evan
MatthewBerryTMR	710246145319161856	2016-03-16T23:27:31	4/4 GREAT move for Pats but I'm not sure I see weekly, consistent fantasy value for Bennett if everyone healthy.
MatthewBerryTMR	710245779638788096	2016-03-16T23:26:04	3/4 Bennett a high end TE2 for me. He will be a MUST have for any Gronk owner. NE runs a ton of 2 TE sets but TB spreads it around...
MatthewBerryTMR	710245349798125569	2016-03-16T23:24:21	2/3 And could argue Bennett might be 5th in pass O, after Dion Lewis and Chris Hogan. Better O for Bennett but a lot less touches...
MatthewBerryTMR	710245028082425856	2016-03-16T23:23:05	Whoa. Z Miller, Brady &amp; Pats O up, Bennett remains neutral to slightly down for me. Will be 3rd option at best 1/2 
MatthewBerryTMR	710243233855610880	2016-03-16T23:15:57	.RotoWire has 1000's of projections-custom rank/auction generator-draft software-more. They're 1 of the 6 sites in

MatthewBerryTMR	709817572691202049	2016-03-15T19:04:31	Another team somewhat content to lose a DL/pass-rusher headed into a draft absolutely packed with them.

MatthewBerryTMR	709807254170640384	2016-03-15T18:23:31	2/2 Even with a big armed QB who likes to take shots deep, I can't imagine Wallace having consistent fantasy value next year.
MatthewBerryTMR	709807086977343489	2016-03-15T18:22:51	Would assume he'll take deep role they wanted Perriman to take. Will be better for BAL &amp; Flacco than fantasy. 1/2

MatthewBerryTMR	694927442734088193	2016-02-03T16:56:28	gobucks34 or that it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. He may very well be guilty. But it wasn't proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
MatthewBerryTMR	694927295279185920	2016-02-03T16:55:52	gobucks34 certainly came across that way. You are correct about this: no one will convince me they got a fair trial.

MatthewBerryTMR	694924226164297728	2016-02-03T16:43:41	VersaceJonet my guess is her family would want the right person in jail for the crime. Has yet to be proven the right guy is in jail for it
MatthewBerryTMR	694923934312108032	2016-02-03T16:42:31	Hawaii_Duglow I am aware of the other side. What was missing?

MatthewBerryTMR	694922945072926723	2016-02-03T16:38:35	gobucks34 cullo7 JoeAtWork87 Because I'm sure being a HS kid with last name Avery was walk in the park. No one ever said anything, right?
MatthewBerryTMR	694922680382922753	2016-02-03T16:37:32	gobucks34 cullo7 JoeAtWork87 oh? A HS kid said something? That changes everything! He must be guilty if a high schooler said that!

MatthewBerryTMR	694907398016909312	2016-02-03T15:36:49	JoeAtWork87 what evidence do you feel was crucial to state's case that got left out? The DNA under hood that was a contaminated transfer?
MatthewBerryTMR	694907137357697024	2016-02-03T15:35:46	RailMeansRail think he came off poorly but guy lost his sis in a gruesome horrific manner. Who knows how any of us react in that scenario?

MatthewBerryTMR	688876528432746497	2016-01-18T00:12:17	Wait, it's a touchback if you muff the ball outside the end zone and then recover it in the end zone? That's a horrible rule.
MatthewBerryTMR	688837078080188416	2016-01-17T21:35:32	CorySkweres sea d playing much better since that game
MatthewBerryTMR	688835764252184576	2016-01-17T21:30:18	I did. He proved me wrong. Thought SEA run D would be better &amp; he was hurt RT bgb_11 you hated the real Jonathan Stewart. No excuses there!

MatthewBerryTMR	683689467530604544	2016-01-03T16:40:46	Anything is possible but I am not starting any WSH players in season long  
MatthewBerryTMR	683688431105490944	2016-01-03T16:36:38	Expect RB to be heavily involved in pass game RT BradBiggs: Bears TE Zach Miller is inactive. He missed practice all week.
MatthewBerryTMR	683688032415920128	2016-01-03T16:35:03	Amendola and Eifert are both ACTIVE. Bilal Powell &amp; Matt Jones are OUT

MatthewBerryTMR	683685504739590145	2016-01-03T16:25:01	I mean... 
MatthewBerryTMR	683685357611794432	2016-01-03T16:24:26	No Trent to protect Kirk's blindside. Think DAL moves Hardy over there some? Me too. Can't see Kirk playing a lot.

MatthewBerryTMR	682289197013692418	2015-12-30T19:56:35	Think Forte doesn't play or is limited at best. Was limited in practice today. Will move based on Forte's health

MatthewBerryTMR	682270770744135680	2015-12-30T18:43:22	Top 10 QB for me this wk - avail in 82% of leagues. Prefer him to Cousins, for example (Think Kirk sits most of gm) 
MatthewBerryTMR	682270116986355712	2015-12-30T18:40:46	Obviously a long way to go for WSH, but for first time in a while, arrow pointing up. Need to bring Cousins back tho.
MatthewBerryTMR	682269779038711808	2015-12-30T18:39:25	VitimusPime good point - never like to see people fired, however.
MatthewBerryTMR	682269317476515840	2015-12-30T18:37:35	Chip fired; Coughlin on hot seat, Dallas 4-11 w/lots of ? on field and off..Don't look now but most stable franchise in NFC East? Redskins
