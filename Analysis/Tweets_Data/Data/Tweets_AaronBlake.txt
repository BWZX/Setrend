AaronBlake	707750044787744768	2016-03-10T02:08:54	Wouldn't it be great if Bernie busted out some Spanish in his opening statement? That makes me laugh just thinking about it.

AaronBlake	703287750498381824	2016-02-26T18:37:20	Hmmm 
AaronBlake	703286596741701632	2016-02-26T18:32:45	Christie is by no means popular with the GOP base, but you gotta think some folks who like Trump feel like they have been vindicated.

AaronBlake	703256308171055104	2016-02-26T16:32:24	CNN basically ignored Ben Carson at Thursday's debate. And that's just fine.

AaronBlake	703211185882140672	2016-02-26T13:33:06	Trump is the rare Republican who says he won't take sides in Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Will that hurt him? 
AaronBlake	703209171299246084	2016-02-26T13:25:06	Thursday’s GOP debate got personal — very personal  
AaronBlake	703092424566927360	2016-02-26T05:41:11	I mean, without Florida...

AaronBlake	703065471227195392	2016-02-26T03:54:05	Full transcript from tonight's debate will live here, with analysis:  
AaronBlake	703064238135382016	2016-02-26T03:49:11	This hands thing would have been great 4 months ago, no?
AaronBlake	703063109825601536	2016-02-26T03:44:42	Hey Wolf, how about JUST "the last pitch" and not "including the last pitch."
AaronBlake	703062889641418752	2016-02-26T03:43:49	Rubio totally missed a chance to say he would build the Canadian border wall and make Canada pay for it.
AaronBlake	703062477874003969	2016-02-26T03:42:11	Trump finally found something that he couldn't do by force of will: Build a wall along the Canadian border
AaronBlake	703060938027573253	2016-02-26T03:36:04	Okay closing statements time!!
AaronBlake	703060727230287873	2016-02-26T03:35:14	This is moving from spirited debate to totally unwieldy.
AaronBlake	703059812360265728	2016-02-26T03:31:36	Ben Carson's "Can somebody attack me, please" line tonight sums up American politics this year.
AaronBlake	703059810196000769	2016-02-26T03:31:35	Just ... no. 
AaronBlake	703059750230089728	2016-02-26T03:31:21	Marco Rubio came out swinging at Trump, and one punch really landed: Trump University  
AaronBlake	703054980413005824	2016-02-26T03:12:24	Cruz just referenced Trump's "nearly 70 years of living." Age attacks!
AaronBlake	703054790352310272	2016-02-26T03:11:38	Another way in which Trump is one-of-a-kind: His language on Israeli-Palestinian conflict sounds nothing like other Republicans.
AaronBlake	703054026699575296	2016-02-26T03:08:36	This late commercial break also makes me think this goes past 11 p.m. Please no.
AaronBlake	703053731676463104	2016-02-26T03:07:26	Doesn't "purge" also mean vomit?
AaronBlake	703052717590241282	2016-02-26T03:03:24	I would vote for anyone who gives us a commercial break right now
AaronBlake	703052201510490112	2016-02-26T03:01:21	"Media's laying off Trump now" says Cruz who's been laying off Trump the entire campaign
AaronBlake	703052471833329664	2016-02-26T03:02:26	dtoddharris I believe you. It does seem a little rushed.
AaronBlake	703052327960317952	2016-02-26T03:01:51	Up is down. 
AaronBlake	703052060154077185	2016-02-26T03:00:47	Almost like this was planned?? 
AaronBlake	703051518279356416	2016-02-26T02:58:38	The CNN-Telemundo Republican debate transcript, annotated 
AaronBlake	703051320907923457	2016-02-26T02:57:51	This is the first time Trump has cited an audit for not releasing his tax returns?
AaronBlake	703051229337882629	2016-02-26T02:57:29	So the Trump-Hewitt feud is back on.
AaronBlake	703051017785573376	2016-02-26T02:56:39	Trump can't release his tax returns because he's being audited now?
AaronBlake	703046891295137793	2016-02-26T02:40:15	Rubio makes a totally fair point that Trump doesn't have much of a leg to stand on when it comes to reliance on talking points.
AaronBlake	703042669254156290	2016-02-26T02:23:28	About 2% of eligible Hispanic voters in Nevada voted in GOP caucuses. About 1% voted for Trump. 
AaronBlake	703042300184809473	2016-02-26T02:22:00	Donald Trump did win the Latino vote in Nevada. It doesn't mean Latinos suddenly love him.  
AaronBlake	703041699023626240	2016-02-26T02:19:37	Telemundo is hardly the only poll to show Trump with terrible numbers among Hispanics.
AaronBlake	703038543858438144	2016-02-26T02:07:05	Rubio with the ouch: “If he hadn’t inherited $200 million, you know where he’d be? Selling watches in Manhattan.”
AaronBlake	703036604143824896	2016-02-26T01:59:22	The Fix is highlighting and analyzing all the key moments from tonight's debate:  
AaronBlake	703033341470228480	2016-02-26T01:46:24	Just me or was Trump's heart not really in that?
AaronBlake	703031025652404226	2016-02-26T01:37:12	This debate was dramatic before it even began; 2 separate media outlets were banned as sponsors. 
AaronBlake	703030187693359106	2016-02-26T01:33:53	The most applause a Bush has gotten in the last 12 months.

AaronBlake	703013311990857728	2016-02-26T00:26:49	Donald Trump thinks he’s the victim of an F-bomb double standard 
AaronBlake	702967513563287553	2016-02-25T21:24:50	Needless to say, saying you're prepping for a brokered convention doesn't suggest a position of strength 
AaronBlake	702965262501453825	2016-02-25T21:15:53	Why haven't Donald Trump's tax returns and Hillary Clinton's speech transcripts gotten the Romney treatment? 
AaronBlake	702944556929699844	2016-02-25T19:53:37	.pbump did some digging and figured out that Ted Cruz is not, in fact, the Zodiac Killer  
AaronBlake	702944265287163905	2016-02-25T19:52:27	Brian Sandoval had good reason to duck out of the SCOTUS sweepstakes: He was about to be RINO-fied. 
AaronBlake	702916892844027904	2016-02-25T18:03:41	I'm sure Harry Reid would be happy to. 
AaronBlake	702895410004623360	2016-02-25T16:38:19	Democrats love Sanders's single-payer health care as long as you call it 'Medicare for all'  
AaronBlake	702890415368880129	2016-02-25T16:18:28	Hey look it's byamberphillips and MaxEhrenfreund talking about the value of explanatory journalism! 
AaronBlake	702884830216855552	2016-02-25T15:56:17	Now THAT would be quite the ticket. 
AaronBlake	702884493074546688	2016-02-25T15:54:56	nicolinr97 That can happen with rounding.
AaronBlake	702882999831011328	2016-02-25T15:49:00	This poll showing Donald Trump romping in Florida is very, very bad news for Marco Rubio  
AaronBlake	702879118279503872	2016-02-25T15:33:35	Donald Trump bashes Mitt Romney, a man he used to love. He does this a lot.  
AaronBlake	702853841704914944	2016-02-25T13:53:08	The RINO-fication of Brian Sandoval begins. Good luck with that future Cabinet job.
AaronBlake	702853125212934144	2016-02-25T13:50:18	AliLapp It certainly helps to be really, really, ridiculously good-looking
AaronBlake	702852367641878529	2016-02-25T13:47:17	5 wacky new media theories about the presidential race, including Kasich as Hillary's running mate 
AaronBlake	702852245793202176	2016-02-25T13:46:48	Donald Trump's first two supporters in Congress are backing him for very different reasons 
AaronBlake	702851187570315264	2016-02-25T13:42:36	21% of Dems view single-payer very positively. If you call it "Medicare for all," it's 53%. 
AaronBlake	702850997123751936	2016-02-25T13:41:50	Sanders would be well-advised to stop saying "single-payer" and stick with "Medicare for all." Polls MUCH better. 
AaronBlake	702849039772024833	2016-02-25T13:34:04	Melania defends Donald by saying she immigrated legally. But for models, it's easier.  
AaronBlake	702830640392228864	2016-02-25T12:20:57	It begins. Sandoval may soon wish he had never been vetted. 
AaronBlake	702830283838648321	2016-02-25T12:19:32	Muy interesante

AaronBlake	702579453931724800	2016-02-24T19:42:49	Trump apparently won the Latino vote in Nevada. It doesn't mean Latinos suddenly love him.

AaronBlake	695431449722298368	2016-02-05T02:19:12	Hillary calls this cherry-picking. She said it in September: "I get accused of being kind of moderate and center. I plead guilty."
