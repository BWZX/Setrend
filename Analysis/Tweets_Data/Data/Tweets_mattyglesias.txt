mattyglesias	707672349374554112	2016-03-09T21:00:10	Hillary and Bernie should debate TARP! 
mattyglesias	707672155585187840	2016-03-09T20:59:24	Nate_Cohn Ah, gotcha.
mattyglesias	707671938907373568	2016-03-09T20:58:32	Nate_Cohn ??
mattyglesias	707671806220640257	2016-03-09T20:58:01	Nate_Cohn It’s fascinating that on the Dem side the TX-OK border counties are so different.

mattyglesias	707667811464822784	2016-03-09T20:42:08	jeremyadamsmith It is. But I can’t really go back and time and become more humble about my read of the polls from a week ago.

mattyglesias	707644087185223680	2016-03-09T19:07:52	Terez27 MattBruenig I was really amped up about the 2008 primary, my preferred guy won, and in retrospect I regret getting so invested.
mattyglesias	707633956301238272	2016-03-09T18:27:37	MattBruenig Good look in Ohio!
mattyglesias	707633521637068800	2016-03-09T18:25:53	MattBruenig You are very emotionally invested in this primary and I wish you well.
mattyglesias	707633197899763712	2016-03-09T18:24:36	MattBruenig You are mocking but it's pretty clear that she is, in fact, closer on policy to Obama than Sanders is.
mattyglesias	707632270870450177	2016-03-09T18:20:55	This is bad politics but a better argument about Sanders and TARP would be that TARP was good. Presumably that's why Clinton was for it.
mattyglesias	707632060593266688	2016-03-09T18:20:05	chrislhayes But also clear that the money would be released regardless of the vote!
mattyglesias	707631735584849920	2016-03-09T18:18:47	chrislhayes They both voted against TARP I, without which there would have been no funds. Don't see how she can limit this to TARP 2.
mattyglesias	707630980203413504	2016-03-09T18:15:47	Article coming soon but Clinton's auto bailout line is odd. Is it her view that Sen Stabenow and Rep Conyers opposed the auto bailout?
mattyglesias	707619239947931649	2016-03-09T17:29:08	MattBruenig This is one reason I’m skeptical that "trade policy” is actually the driver of trade deficits.

mattyglesias	707507858263384064	2016-03-09T10:06:32	mtracey Yes, but Clinton had won big with black voters in NV &amp; MA. My guess is Sanders started changing minds with focus on trade.
mattyglesias	707506676581195776	2016-03-09T10:01:51	Michigan win is big because it's much blacker (14%) than other Sanders states so far. Changes how we should think about several more states.
