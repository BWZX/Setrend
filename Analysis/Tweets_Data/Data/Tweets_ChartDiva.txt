ChartDiva	261568912464957440	2012-10-25T20:44:23	OMG. Such a big disappointment.  With over 23% eps growth forecast over *next 5 yrs.* and current PEG of .60 should AAPL pps drop to $400.
ChartDiva	261566668189347840	2012-10-25T20:35:28	Do these number reflect the China imitations?  ;-)
ChartDiva	261566407987306497	2012-10-25T20:34:25	With a current PEG of .60, this will be interesting bespokeinvest AAPL forecasting 15% y/y decline in Q1 EPS. That's a change
