SharylAttkisson	719744813017473024	2016-04-12T04:31:50	jdelugach All should agree logically that vaccines should be made as safe as possible. That's only controversial to industry/surrogates.
SharylAttkisson	719744603415580673	2016-04-12T04:31:00	Philippians4u13 DrPaulOffit By that I mean he's doing his job, like it or not. But we aren't doing ours.
SharylAttkisson	719744407617060865	2016-04-12T04:30:13	jdelugach It's like that. I, too, believed one set of ideas and was shocked with what I learned from govt/pharma/vaccine insiders.

SharylAttkisson	719734734721544192	2016-04-12T03:51:47	TheMorningSpew ahrferrier Now some researchers say they must sign agreements to promise not to publish negative findings AND

SharylAttkisson	719729861728800768	2016-04-12T03:32:25	WyldeRhoads Facts are facts whether people like them or not. It's not the news media's job to censor facts based on expected response.
SharylAttkisson	719729660813275137	2016-04-12T03:31:37	Gary0k Yes. When news media partnered w/pharma on lobbying to allow direct to consumer advertising ($$) I think the media was bought.
SharylAttkisson	719729470203109376	2016-04-12T03:30:52	drberzerko It's one and the same now in many cases. Money has brought them all together. Government/corporation/pharma/etc

SharylAttkisson	719728171143315457	2016-04-12T03:25:42	ahrferrier True but with vaccines, the standards aren't always matching up w/the science due to industry influence.
SharylAttkisson	719728005397000198	2016-04-12T03:25:03	ahrferrier I hope some of my answers made some sense. Hard on Twitter! It is definitely a serious issue.
SharylAttkisson	719727851348574208	2016-04-12T03:24:26	ahrferrier But they're not even trying because govt/studies/agenda have been so co-opted by the industry
SharylAttkisson	719727741533335552	2016-04-12T03:24:00	ahrferrier now determine which kids have susceptibilities to vaccines &amp; cull them out but vaccinate the others safely &amp; maintain coverage
SharylAttkisson	719727656955199488	2016-04-12T03:23:39	ahrferrier I see your point and that sounds reasonable until you understand that ea. vaccine and kid may have diff formula &amp; medicine can
SharylAttkisson	719727217127923712	2016-04-12T03:21:55	MannyQuinn23 ahrferrier It's a tactic most don't even know is being put forth by vaccine/govt/pharma propagandists. But ppl r getting wise
SharylAttkisson	719726020115447808	2016-04-12T03:17:09	ahrferrier She was pro-vaccine but was of course attacked by propagandists when she spoke of facts she'd learned 
SharylAttkisson	719725487195623424	2016-04-12T03:15:02	ahrferrier Fmr National Institutes of Health Director Bernardine Healy was strong on this &amp; what she viewed as colleagues' malfeasance.
SharylAttkisson	719725328751554562	2016-04-12T03:14:24	ahrferrier Maybe you should talk to some informed, opposing scientists &amp; views and learn about nuance and make up your mind.
SharylAttkisson	719725112832978945	2016-04-12T03:13:33	fareastphillips Yes I did
SharylAttkisson	719725009757945856	2016-04-12T03:13:08	ahrferrier gives all vaccines a bad name, to some, that many don't deserve.
SharylAttkisson	719724939100741633	2016-04-12T03:12:51	ahrferrier industry insiders &amp; whistleblowers have revealed some of the cynical discussions discarding safety for $$. Too bad... that
SharylAttkisson	719724799824654338	2016-04-12T03:12:18	ahrferrier Of course that's the hope and goal, but they are such big money makers that there are other considerations made, sadly.
SharylAttkisson	719724536514637824	2016-04-12T03:11:15	ahrferrier Each is different. But vaccine propagandists want ppl to promote as a group and discourage discussion of safety..
SharylAttkisson	719724332142960641	2016-04-12T03:10:27	ahrferrier I could go on, but my point is..vaccines/medicine aren't monolithic. They're not all equally safe or effective for all ppl...
SharylAttkisson	719724143072124928	2016-04-12T03:09:42	ahrferrier Govt research concluded flu shots not effective in elderly so that's another calculus.
SharylAttkisson	719723857440083968	2016-04-12T03:08:34	ahrferrier And--what time? Many vaccines are forbidden from begin given too young or too old. So I don't support giving them too young/old.
SharylAttkisson	719723464408571904	2016-04-12T03:07:00	ahrferrier I generally support polio vaccine -- but not the oral version pulled from market in US for safety reasons a few years back.
SharylAttkisson	719723337488973824	2016-04-12T03:06:30	ahrferrier I can't support vaccines that the govt has pulled off the market for safety reasons. Nobody does...
SharylAttkisson	719723214386110465	2016-04-12T03:06:00	ahrferrier I'm for penicillin, but I'm not for giving it to people who may die from penicillin allergy AND
SharylAttkisson	719723057036857344	2016-04-12T03:05:23	ahrferrier Of course not. Which vaccine? For which kid? It's as silly as asking "are you against medicine?" By that I mean--
SharylAttkisson	719722218431885312	2016-04-12T03:02:03	ReenyNY DrPaulOffit THR The propagandists claim those who work to improve vaccine safety are anti-vaccine. It's designed to silence.
SharylAttkisson	719721962113777664	2016-04-12T03:01:02	This is my original story that got DrPaulOffit &amp; vaccine makers so steamed. Just the facts.  THR
SharylAttkisson	719721560748212224	2016-04-12T02:59:26	I don't blame DrPaulOffit so much he's serving his pharma/vaccine master. I blame media for not doing homework THR

SharylAttkisson	714606413406998529	2016-03-29T00:13:40	I agree. But here’s the difference: I support a $15 federal minimum wage. HillaryClinton does not. 
SharylAttkisson	714619931938197504	2016-03-29T01:07:23	We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games, we must be smart, tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN &amp; MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!

SharylAttkisson	714541240935702528	2016-03-28T19:54:42	Just asking.
SharylAttkisson	714541065672531972	2016-03-28T19:54:00	Here's a question: is "aggression" offended by the term "microaggression," which unfairly minimizes "aggression"?

SharylAttkisson	714150220364382208	2016-03-27T18:00:55	You could be right, but we are so far from elex. Several months ago, all polls showed Rubio ahead &amp; no Trump.  
SharylAttkisson	714149978260815872	2016-03-27T17:59:57	Maybe but the Obama admin stats are what's startling. 10's of thousands of rapes, homicides, serious crimes..

SharylAttkisson	714149003198341125	2016-03-27T17:56:05	It seems to me you should decide upon your sample in advance and then meet it. Why 324 (rather than 300 or 350)?
SharylAttkisson	714148852656418816	2016-03-27T17:55:29	Is it possible that some polls stop when they have the answers they want? I don't mean more reputable ones. But just asking...because
SharylAttkisson	714148769818931200	2016-03-27T17:55:09	Here's a question &amp; it's not to suggest there's not a good answer.. but when a poll interviews, say 324 people.. what made them stop at 324?

SharylAttkisson	714143707214258177	2016-03-27T17:35:02	In this analysis, I looked for pluses and minuses of each.  
SharylAttkisson	714143611730919424	2016-03-27T17:34:39	But it's hard to blame ppl for thinking it because so many report from their own personal biases these days.
