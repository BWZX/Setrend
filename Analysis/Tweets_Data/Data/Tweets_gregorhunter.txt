gregorhunter	717951009629188097	2016-04-07T05:43:54	habibahamid In the era of US Fatca it's also difficult to give those guarantees. It would mean not dealing with the US financial system.
gregorhunter	717950638328393729	2016-04-07T05:42:25	habibahamid That's somewhat true. But I don't think that's very likely in Gulf police states.
