TorstenBell	710120421958541312	2016-03-16T15:07:56	60% of the £10bn surplus in 2019/20 is driven by a timing change on corporation tax for large firms... repeat 60%

TorstenBell	710086703982235648	2016-03-16T12:53:57	That is big big increases in borrowing right up to 2019/20 - when CX is aiming to be back on track
