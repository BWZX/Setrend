johnolilly	725403712282353664	2016-04-27T19:18:17	I wonder how long it took Cruz’ advisors to talk him out of naming himself as his own running mate.

johnolilly	725390618118217729	2016-04-27T18:26:15	Cruz should go ahead and just name his cabinet. Could pick up a few more votes that way.

johnolilly	725124008375517184	2016-04-27T00:46:50	MikeIsaac I think mostly it’s a reaction to the “apple doomed” over-reaction. It’s one of the largest companies in the world. Complex.
johnolilly	725123273533448192	2016-04-27T00:43:55	I would say something like “GOP, holy shit,” except, and everyone knows this: we are way past that point. Good luck.

johnolilly	723572886699569152	2016-04-22T18:03:14	artypapers okay. The headline isn’t what I said so is frustrating. Talking is part of my job.  But I hear you.

johnolilly	723570162289369088	2016-04-22T17:52:24	artypapers one way is to be document centric instead of communication centric which is what Quip, Figma, some others do
johnolilly	723569987516919810	2016-04-22T17:51:42	artypapers I really genuinely like slack and said that. I also think it creates some new overload that is worth working through.

johnolilly	723567308195532800	2016-04-22T17:41:04	artypapers depends on which. Short q&amp;a doesn’t capture nuance.
johnolilly	723565628498419712	2016-04-22T17:34:23	artypapers slack solves some (which I said), but the granularity of communication creates some new ones.
johnolilly	723565507199135744	2016-04-22T17:33:54	artypapers we can debate it. But I do think there are legitimate org info architecture issues to work on.

johnolilly	723537906636189696	2016-04-22T15:44:14	harper stewart sigh. I said “not exactly soul crushing!” Email is soul crushing.
johnolilly	723535391807004672	2016-04-22T15:34:14	hunterwalk stewart so much.
johnolilly	723535298051760134	2016-04-22T15:33:52	MikeIsaac yeah those people man
johnolilly	723535166350618624	2016-04-22T15:33:20	MikeIsaac bingo.
johnolilly	723535000558166016	2016-04-22T15:32:41	MikeIsaac that was the subtext yeah
johnolilly	723534765886824448	2016-04-22T15:31:45	The content is right - it’s a tricky balance, but for the # of times I said I love Slack, the headline is ridonks.
johnolilly	723534486432960512	2016-04-22T15:30:38	Ack - might as well get ahead of this stewart! Tried to have a nuanced convo, but the headline didn’t capture: 
johnolilly	723372786429775872	2016-04-22T04:48:06	Good night guys.  Today we laughed, we cried, we mourned, we danced.  What more could we ask of that electric word, life?
johnolilly	723368492024504320	2016-04-22T04:31:02	potch they don’t have to take rides anymore. Not sure of the cite
johnolilly	723368391084396544	2016-04-22T04:30:38	Charles Barkley is entertaining, but huh. OTOH, the Big Aristotle is the best.
johnolilly	723367982412374018	2016-04-22T04:29:01	nabeel just a lot of weird decisions seems to me.
johnolilly	723367711699394560	2016-04-22T04:27:56	Huh. Nearly the most Rocketsian kind of turnover at the end there.
johnolilly	723367225168556033	2016-04-22T04:26:00	Delicious: harden will have to play defense to win it. Not really his jam.
johnolilly	723366802525298688	2016-04-22T04:24:19	satishd just not very smart. No reason to take a 25 foot shot there.
johnolilly	723366651823955968	2016-04-22T04:23:43	You can just tell from the video how much everyone on the Rockets really loves each other.
johnolilly	723366261653016577	2016-04-22T04:22:10	Weird. The Warriors seem to play a lot better with the MVP in the game.
johnolilly	723365826066141185	2016-04-22T04:20:27	Dumb shot by Thomson
johnolilly	723364492059406338	2016-04-22T04:15:09	The Rockets are the worst.

johnolilly	723361934590922753	2016-04-22T04:04:59	This is some sloppy basketball.

johnolilly	723355430819262465	2016-04-22T03:39:08	James Harden is a little random.
johnolilly	723353401350709249	2016-04-22T03:31:04	saranormous honestly, I could probably just tattoo SMH on my knuckles and it’d be relevant.
johnolilly	723298209615908865	2016-04-21T23:51:46	Hey jw if the Mavs could pick up the pace here a little bit, that’d really help the Spurs a lot. Thx.

johnolilly	723232093019365377	2016-04-21T19:29:02	johnolilly Yeah super odd. He didn't even pitch you or at least give you a deck?
johnolilly	723230864910389249	2016-04-21T19:24:09	Anyone else think it’s a little weird that you can push a button on your phone, walk outside, and some dude in a Camry hands you a burrito?

johnolilly	723179800630685696	2016-04-21T16:01:15	bryce you get me, even when you’re teasing.
johnolilly	723179644887814145	2016-04-21T16:00:38	Excited about this event. Hope folks can make it out. Important topic.  
johnolilly	722860973241937921	2016-04-20T18:54:20	join sheplusplus for a screening of CODEdoc with johnolilly aileenlee jgoldfein and others! 
johnolilly	723179460623667201	2016-04-21T15:59:54	I only care because it’s become such a critical part of the way I get around now.
johnolilly	723179277609394176	2016-04-21T15:59:10	Luxe logistics not working as well lately. Have to wait nearly every time now; today more than 15 minutes. Not as good as 2015.
johnolilly	723144357377789956	2016-04-21T13:40:24	mattocko not from me you don’t. But the equivalence between the two men in terms of danger to our society is wrong.
johnolilly	723141176686043137	2016-04-21T13:27:46	mattocko well. The argument you were making was that Trump and Sanders are equally dangerous, which is quite different.

johnolilly	723007769662492672	2016-04-21T04:37:39	Ben is extremely smart, in very sneaky and subtle ways.

johnolilly	722994754380689410	2016-04-21T03:45:56	johnolilly You're letting everyone in on the secret. Drive uber on sandhill. Best way to raise funding AND get tweeted about by John Lilly.
johnolilly	722888804105789440	2016-04-20T20:44:56	hunterwalk this picture came out of it, so there’s some upside I suppose
johnolilly	722876306841468929	2016-04-20T19:55:16	Yeah. Just… sigh. 
johnolilly	722876067896107008	2016-04-20T19:54:19	qhardy but selfies are how we know about them. The medium is the message man.
johnolilly	722858284865093632	2016-04-20T18:43:39	narendra it was an accident.
johnolilly	722857304962412544	2016-04-20T18:39:46	“Sounds like you’re not that interested.” Me: “huh, what? Sorry. I was just tweeting about this convo.”
johnolilly	722857092143386624	2016-04-20T18:38:55	“I mean, it’s not gonna be a billion dollar business out of the gate”
johnolilly	722856296286818304	2016-04-20T18:35:45	Spontaneous Uber driver startup pitches are...not my favorite use of time.
johnolilly	722830125318836224	2016-04-20T16:51:46	khuey_ not really a convo i want to get into or have insight into. but you should talk with your manager about it instead of subtweeting :)
johnolilly	722829569258958848	2016-04-20T16:49:33	khuey_ as of a couple of years ago, were certainly annual reviews. In any event, what you really want is active management.
johnolilly	722829223367344129	2016-04-20T16:48:11	work_matters seems obvious that you need real feedback loops on a more timely basis. AKA “management”! :)
johnolilly	722827292896940033	2016-04-20T16:40:30	This is increasingly clear. We got rid of them at Mozilla; think they have crept back in since. As they do.  
johnolilly	722826877123977216	2016-04-20T16:38:51	I wonder who Donald Trump thinks should be on the 20 dollar bill, said no human being ever. Or, maybe 1 human being.
johnolilly	722822022263230464	2016-04-20T16:19:34	.ben_mathes well, yes. I was just screwing around, but that was the actual history thing behind it. History, man.
johnolilly	722821605995388928	2016-04-20T16:17:54	TIL:  - includes crowd faves such as “Populism, Yea, Yea!” “Illness as a Metaphor” and “10 Little Indians”. OK!
johnolilly	722820385830350848	2016-04-20T16:13:03	Plus, Jackson the Musical suuuuuucccked.
johnolilly	722820308315430912	2016-04-20T16:12:45	This is good news, and where it should have landed from the very beginning. Tubman to replace Jackson on $20. 
johnolilly	722819714968211456	2016-04-20T16:10:24	Bots are a cool (although early &amp; immature) UX/UI expression, but what really matters is the brain behind the bot.
johnolilly	722654696310222848	2016-04-20T05:14:40	I’m thinking this episode of Twitter is not gonna hold up well in reruns.
johnolilly	722654277680934912	2016-04-20T05:13:00	chrisblizzard mine mostly involve tweets, which seems less great
johnolilly	722652468727914497	2016-04-20T05:05:49	McAndrew that is not a word man.   “Feelz”??
johnolilly	722652186380005377	2016-04-20T05:04:42	potch chrisblizzard yeah
johnolilly	722648682185768961	2016-04-20T04:50:46	chrisblizzard but thanks for noticing!
johnolilly	722648643958910976	2016-04-20T04:50:37	chrisblizzard it hasn’t been a hall of fame night, no.
johnolilly	722647899750981632	2016-04-20T04:47:40	SiVola coolbearcjs dude. Why bring actual data into this??
johnolilly	722647603393990657	2016-04-20T04:46:29	Uhhhh…go on?? 
johnolilly	722645491507470336	2016-04-20T04:38:05	mattocko nah. Clinton will be 45.
johnolilly	722643858023149570	2016-04-20T04:31:36	mattocko I love you, but think this is not correct. This equivalence between Trump and Sanders is just not reasonable.
johnolilly	722642816069984256	2016-04-20T04:27:28	mattocko he isn't.
johnolilly	722642728455180288	2016-04-20T04:27:07	mattocko no. Non violent. No whiff anywhere of violence or exclusion from him actually. CF: "there'll probably be riots"
johnolilly	722641845017309185	2016-04-20T04:23:36	mattocko lotta assholes in America, yes.
johnolilly	722641151552069636	2016-04-20T04:20:51	mattocko not the remotest chance that he is the nominee. Trump completely different.
johnolilly	722641068055994369	2016-04-20T04:20:31	.mattocko more to the point: who cares? He's a fringe left candidate that is just about like what always happens.
johnolilly	722640906856374273	2016-04-20T04:19:52	mattocko for one thing, tweets != physical violence. For another, I don't believe he's called to exclude a group from the US
johnolilly	722640597211836420	2016-04-20T04:18:39	ebudde yep
johnolilly	722640328243724288	2016-04-20T04:17:34	mattocko they are, very objectively, not remotely similar. I hear you, but think your point is unsupportable.
johnolilly	722639086037647360	2016-04-20T04:12:38	adamnash I think you are already doomed. How much could another gadget really hurt that?
johnolilly	722638990759866368	2016-04-20T04:12:16	.mattocko that is definitely, definitely not true. There is no equivalence there.
johnolilly	722638884446871552	2016-04-20T04:11:50	mattocko nah. He’s not the nominee. Not close.
johnolilly	722637757617573888	2016-04-20T04:07:22	jw we will both root for the Mavs. Together. It will be great.
johnolilly	722637303424757761	2016-04-20T04:05:33	I feel like someone needs to help the GOP get into an uber, make sure they get home okay, clean up the vomit, get them to drink some water
johnolilly	722636972984893440	2016-04-20T04:04:14	jw yeah. Those guys. Embarrassing. Pretty clear where we’re heading in the West.
johnolilly	722635677741887488	2016-04-20T03:59:06	jw 66. Shrug
johnolilly	722635534711988225	2016-04-20T03:58:32	jw 7! OTOH, Grizz sitting at 63 right now.
johnolilly	722634797517049857	2016-04-20T03:55:36	Yuge. GOP: u r a mess.
johnolilly	722549234654908416	2016-04-19T22:15:36	Our government(s) continue to imagine a digital world that operates just like the physical one. This won't scale. 
johnolilly	722631554057379844	2016-04-20T03:42:42	New York values…apparently don’t include Ted Cruz.

johnolilly	722621654413643776	2016-04-20T03:03:22	McAndrew so you’re saying everyone hates her then

johnolilly	722616297389817856	2016-04-20T02:42:05	BTrautschold gotta cherish the small things, man.
johnolilly	722615983559446528	2016-04-20T02:40:50	coolbearcjs I am not pushing it on anyone. I said that my kids were very happy it’s back and that there is signal there.
johnolilly	722615815707602944	2016-04-20T02:40:10	coolbearcjs amazon’s incentive to fuck over their customers with the Echo is exceptionally low
johnolilly	722615289884487681	2016-04-20T02:38:05	coolbearcjs dunno man. I worked for Mozilla for half a decade, pretty sure I have some sensitivity here.
johnolilly	722615140164632577	2016-04-20T02:37:29	coolbearcjs better to trust incentives, which are pretty clear in this case.
johnolilly	722615015753142272	2016-04-20T02:36:59	coolbearcjs no not remotely the same.
johnolilly	722614917140885505	2016-04-20T02:36:36	coolbearcjs no you were being passive aggressive. Saying “don’t care about your kids,” “haven’t read the TOS”. Not what my history suggests
johnolilly	722614593151852546	2016-04-20T02:35:19	.coolbearcjs oh come on amazon &amp; theranos not in the same universe.
johnolilly	722613724893155328	2016-04-20T02:31:52	coolbearcjs it’ll get sorted.
johnolilly	722613131751636992	2016-04-20T02:29:30	BTrautschold that dunk was kinda cool, so there’s that.
johnolilly	722612820735451136	2016-04-20T02:28:16	coolbearcjs you’re assuming an awful lot about me
johnolilly	722612493311344640	2016-04-20T02:26:58	.coolbearcjs yes totally. Definitely don’t care about my kids or privacy. 100% right. Obvious from my track record.
johnolilly	722612237207085056	2016-04-20T02:25:57	BTrautschold yeah. This is some weird basketball on both ends.
johnolilly	722611973221801984	2016-04-20T02:24:54	ddt qccurate
johnolilly	722611896881324032	2016-04-20T02:24:36	.coolbearcjs amazon it tells us the weather and some jokes, so that’s cool.
johnolilly	722611187251187712	2016-04-20T02:21:47	BTrautschold I’m not sure up is the direction from here tbh. Still some down to go.
johnolilly	722611043961163776	2016-04-20T02:21:13	naval Google is the one. Search -&gt; Mobile OS. Or Facebook: web -&gt; mobile. But basically unprecedented.
johnolilly	722610783138353152	2016-04-20T02:20:10	Have been loaning out my Amazon Echo for awhile. Both kids rejoiced when it came back. Interesting signal there.

johnolilly	722609074634764288	2016-04-20T02:13:23	Okay it was all CRUZ!! For awhile. Now, back to TRUMP!!! 1st: yay? 2nd: SMDH.

johnolilly	722596502929944576	2016-04-20T01:23:26	Yeah. Sigh. It’s great living in a post gender, post racial country. 
johnolilly	722582530642153473	2016-04-20T00:27:54	Apple really does the best web tributes. So simple and powerful. This one about Bill Campbell. 
johnolilly	722581323475345408	2016-04-20T00:23:07	MikeIsaac 100% right. If this is what healthy chipotle tastes like, I don’t want to be healthy.

johnolilly	701275946372870144	2016-02-21T05:23:09	MITDelian semil rabois I don’t think those are the most relevant periods tbh. Turn of the 20th century more useful

johnolilly	700353933366026243	2016-02-18T16:19:24	Simple security rule of thumb: don't build encryption for how the world is today, but how it could be if Donald Trump were President.

johnolilly	701197474967343104	2016-02-21T00:11:20	AriX can’t properly do this in tweets. But, fundamentally, it is first about whether a company has to help subvert security.

johnolilly	700119079974113280	2016-02-18T00:46:10	SharatGanesh rabois nope. Nobody in the normal world will care.
johnolilly	700118543652638720	2016-02-18T00:44:03	Anyone (already) have an analysis of how district court likely to rule in Apple encryption matter? Or precedents for 9th circuit or SCOTUS?
johnolilly	700118055842525185	2016-02-18T00:42:06	rabois as a result, I bet polling is all screwed up. Not to mention campaign field offices. Will be interesting.
johnolilly	700117820625948672	2016-02-18T00:41:10	rabois yep. It’s weird.
johnolilly	700117549090865152	2016-02-18T00:40:05	rabois I think depends on a lot of things. Super hard to predict. Open primaries. CA vote hasn’t mattered for ages, so who knows??
johnolilly	700117271943864321	2016-02-18T00:38:59	rabois pointsnfigures much more likely IMHO. Cruz #3. But I still think Trump by 12.
johnolilly	700106864390877184	2016-02-17T23:57:38	verge he didn’t. Was more circumspect than that. Not exactly the same position.
johnolilly	700105698189791237	2016-02-17T23:53:00	Eff1ngtonPost pointsnfigures rabois nope
johnolilly	700104961049305088	2016-02-17T23:50:04	rabois depends on how many candidates still in. He’ll take 25-35% one way or another.
johnolilly	700104733566963713	2016-02-17T23:49:10	pointsnfigures rabois I don’t think Cruz will win SC. No evidence at all for that outcome.
johnolilly	700103346468843521	2016-02-17T23:43:39	eric_analytics KDbyProxy MikeIsaac no. 4-4 means lower court ruling would stand with no precedent created
johnolilly	700103187236319234	2016-02-17T23:43:01	rabois but in any event, he’s not really pulling enough votes to swing it
johnolilly	700103103014637569	2016-02-17T23:42:41	rabois I thought so but now am unsure. I suspect he stays in and uses SuperPAC to try to “save the party”
johnolilly	700101644705517569	2016-02-17T23:36:54	KDbyProxy MikeIsaac right. I don’t know how they’d line up. And some chance Scalia would have sided with Apple I think.
johnolilly	700101073411969028	2016-02-17T23:34:37	rabois correct. Which is why I suggested GOP has got to get the field winnowed.
johnolilly	700093877622067200	2016-02-17T23:06:02	MikeIsaac one interesting scenario: district court -&gt; 9th circuit (generally liberal) -&gt; 8 member SCOTUS — 4-4 means upholds  9th circuit
johnolilly	700093614647599104	2016-02-17T23:04:59	MikeIsaac yes. This is a tricky, tricky case for Apple.
johnolilly	700071030493032448	2016-02-17T21:35:15	I think the update system’s integrity is *precisely* the core issue and precedent here, yep.  
johnolilly	700047439869292544	2016-02-17T20:01:30	AriX yes it is. They’re asking Apple to create a system that will allow this for any phone they find and get a warrant for.
johnolilly	700047287691522048	2016-02-17T20:00:54	AriX your narrow definition is of course right. But I think you can define circumventing the login similarly tbh
johnolilly	700045961440075776	2016-02-17T19:55:38	AriX not to me. I thought excellent and clear tbh
johnolilly	700045874173313024	2016-02-17T19:55:17	.AriX I’m not sure. Interesting scenario if it goes to SCOTUS
johnolilly	700045420387389441	2016-02-17T19:53:29	AriX bad precedents abound. Lots of ways to lose.
johnolilly	700045176610271232	2016-02-17T19:52:30	AriX I get that. But leads to requiring this capability over time. I generally believe in our warrant and judiciary, but big implications
johnolilly	700044023185018880	2016-02-17T19:47:55	IMHO the WH is generally extremely thoughtful on encryption. But this is a slippery slope.  
johnolilly	700043821682266112	2016-02-17T19:47:07	AriX slippery slope. Once the create a way to subvert one, will happen more.
johnolilly	700026117441216512	2016-02-17T18:36:46	BenedictEvans might be. I actually think we are underfocused on CV
johnolilly	700020296145735681	2016-02-17T18:13:39	BenedictEvans I think the question is how much *should* we? Our vision systems evolved this way for good reasons.

johnolilly	699655227012591616	2016-02-16T18:02:59	sferik I think that’s not the right analysis at all.
johnolilly	699635732361515008	2016-02-16T16:45:31	sferik but my first comment still stands: GOP has to narrow field to be able to win. No realistic other path.
johnolilly	699635633464041475	2016-02-16T16:45:08	sferik perhaps. That article talks about trump’s ceiling, which is what matters.
johnolilly	699635355041935361	2016-02-16T16:44:01	sferik that’s true. However: better odds than Trump v Field

johnolilly	699606350670798848	2016-02-16T14:48:46	bermanjeff yep. A very scary scenario for Dems in the general I think
johnolilly	699606016384700417	2016-02-16T14:47:27	Fascinating (and somewhat sobering.) GOP leadership really should get the field to narrow soon to beat Trump.  
johnolilly	699604733426847744	2016-02-16T14:42:21	bermanjeff I’ve been saying the same. He’s out of central casting for POTUS, would be extremely strong candidate I think.

johnolilly	697508006687182848	2016-02-10T19:50:42	beltzner Rubio closer to Cruz than to the rest. He’s hard right, at least in this cycle.
johnolilly	697505834469715968	2016-02-10T19:42:04	WhampaChick right. If Sanders can raise a ton of dough, he can stay close. If not, it’s a blowout. If he stays close, Bloomberg in.
johnolilly	697504573259280384	2016-02-10T19:37:03	Same.  
johnolilly	697505103322812416	2016-02-10T19:39:10	beltzner the fact that you’re listing Rubio as a moderate suggests they’ve already won, man.
johnolilly	697504948808888320	2016-02-10T19:38:33	WhampaChick yep, although I think that happens for real after South Carolina Democratic primary, not before. Has to gauge Sanders’ support.

johnolilly	692148305262964736	2016-01-27T00:53:10	rabois I suspect that they will, actually. I think his calculus has to be that he can push them over here and show strength. Risky though.

johnolilly	686769026698092544	2016-01-12T04:37:50	Saban should do another onside kick.

johnolilly	685859184684830720	2016-01-09T16:22:26	prchovanec pmarca hblodget in my experience, Twitter maybe not the best way to do that.

johnolilly	685851618596659200	2016-01-09T15:52:23	pmarca scottbelsky hblodget but calling anything in this thread Marxism or anything else is kind of a BS debating tactic
johnolilly	685851515911712768	2016-01-09T15:51:58	pmarca scottbelsky hblodget that's a deliberately provocative label. What he said is that this measure is getting worse &amp;causing problems
johnolilly	685851238622089216	2016-01-09T15:50:52	pmarca scottbelsky hblodget they support him because of a variety of emotional and background issues.
johnolilly	685851086050082816	2016-01-09T15:50:16	pmarca scottbelsky hblodget ...for his support. Scott posited a mechanism. Nobody supports someone like this because they love his plans
johnolilly	685850877152735237	2016-01-09T15:49:26	pmarca scottbelsky hblodget Henry did not say "middle America hates inequality and wants us all equal." He said inequality is a driver...
johnolilly	685850312226156544	2016-01-09T15:47:11	pmarca scottbelsky hblodget all Henry said is that inequality is a major contributor, which seems uncontroversial to me
johnolilly	685850199571337216	2016-01-09T15:46:44	pmarca scottbelsky hblodget anyone who believes they understand this completely, or where it will go, is fooling themselves IMHO
johnolilly	685849834851438593	2016-01-09T15:45:17	pmarca scottbelsky hblodget "let's get back to the America we were promised". That is about change, and inequality a dominant vector
johnolilly	685849589400784896	2016-01-09T15:44:19	pmarca scottbelsky hblodget which is why "make America great again", keep out foreigners, etc - all resonate.
johnolilly	685849457213112321	2016-01-09T15:43:47	pmarca scottbelsky hblodget and it's not about redistribution per se - it's people feeling like what they thought was theirs is gone
johnolilly	685849124868997120	2016-01-09T15:42:28	pmarca scottbelsky hblodget people feel left behind, and without options. So: rise of demagoguery. Hardly a recent feeling.
johnolilly	685848919088103424	2016-01-09T15:41:39	pmarca scottbelsky hblodget I'm pretty sure that Blodgett is correct. My family is decidedly not coastal elite. TX &amp; GA, dad in USAF.

johnolilly	685545654647664640	2016-01-08T19:36:35	Nested frames w/ constraints is incredible. One of the standout features of figmadesign UX

johnolilly	685540143348842496	2016-01-08T19:14:41	OK, this photo from the ACA repeal bill signing thingy really is amazing.  
johnolilly	685543755978424320	2016-01-08T19:29:02	rxfoo2 hmm, yeah. probably coulda shortened up a little.
johnolilly	685538305039941632	2016-01-08T19:07:23	nabeel i'm not really arguing, just think that this chart sort of hides the early flat parts. Timing on, say, VR tricky. :)
johnolilly	685538108952031232	2016-01-08T19:06:36	nabeel they're S curves, so questions are: how long early flat part, how steep middle part, how high long term flat part
johnolilly	685537524618407936	2016-01-08T19:04:17	nabeel it's not been totally clear to me that it is accelerating all that much. Nearly vertical adoption curves in the past for things.
johnolilly	685537258309472257	2016-01-08T19:03:13	nabeel yes, for sure. just some things will have horizontal lines well short of 100%
johnolilly	685536527053488128	2016-01-08T19:00:19	nabeel like this robot BBQ grill cleaner i ordered yesterday? Inevitable.
johnolilly	685536413522067456	2016-01-08T18:59:52	nabeel i think depends a little bit on whether broadly mainstream or nichey in use case -- can be somewhat tricky to tell.
