JayCostTWS	726127051443474434	2016-04-29T19:12:34	Trump is not the cause of the GOP's problem's; he's the symptom. He hasn't set conservatism back; he's just revealed how far behind we are.
JayCostTWS	726126600719335424	2016-04-29T19:10:47	CommodoreBTC Yep. A totally disingenuous argument to justify selling out.
JayCostTWS	726125257988382721	2016-04-29T19:05:26	Think on that for a moment. Indecency is now par for the course in Republican politics. What does that say?
JayCostTWS	726125064274497536	2016-04-29T19:04:40	But in the crooked, debauched, morally bankrupt Republican party, that's just doing what you have to do.

JayCostTWS	726123496229752832	2016-04-29T18:58:26	And remember, almost all of the GOP leadership knows Trump would be a danger republic if he wins. THEY WILL BACK HIM ANYWAY.

JayCostTWS	726120966015836160	2016-04-29T18:48:23	They've ignored voters asking again &amp; again for reform of government. But on Trump? Oh on Trump, "Well the PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN!"
JayCostTWS	726120777309917184	2016-04-29T18:47:38	They feed them Reaganesque slogans about reforming government while perpetuating interest-group liberalism.
JayCostTWS	726120676747317250	2016-04-29T18:47:14	The great irony of the Trump capitulation by the GOP is that the party elite have ignored voters for years.

JayCostTWS	725802358467362816	2016-04-28T21:42:21	KevinMaddenDC I will say that George Romney categorically refused to endorse Goldwater, and he won reelection in 1964.

JayCostTWS	725800962112278528	2016-04-28T21:36:48	The plan is to hunker down, "localize" the races, and hope for the best. Worked like a charm in '06 and '08! 11/11

JayCostTWS	725799734036824064	2016-04-28T21:31:55	And remember this is before the South was  the population center it is today. 128 EVs in '64 versus 160 today. 8/
JayCostTWS	725799302577197058	2016-04-28T21:30:13	Goldwater did better in the South in '64 than Nixon '60, but  still ran behind Eisenhower '56. His drop-off in the North was much worse. 7/
JayCostTWS	725799000478257153	2016-04-28T21:29:01	Here's the GOP vote in the South from 48-68. 48: 34% 52: 48% 56: 51% 60: 47% 64: 49% 68: 54% 6/
JayCostTWS	725798673259581442	2016-04-28T21:27:43	You'll note that Goldwater in '64 did better with traditionally Democratic counties in the South, but not that much better region-wide. 5/
JayCostTWS	725798423061008384	2016-04-28T21:26:43	Compare Nixon in '60  to Goldwater in '64  (note: GOP in blue) 4/
JayCostTWS	725798159889358849	2016-04-28T21:25:40	Notice the huge drop-off as Goldwater alienated traditional GOP constituencies. This shows up in a graphical display, too. 3/
JayCostTWS	725798008479186944	2016-04-28T21:25:04	Back then the GOP strength was in the North &amp; West. Here's the party's share from 1948-68. 48: 50% 52: 57% 56: 59% 60: 50% 64: 37.5% 68: 50%
JayCostTWS	725797630572412928	2016-04-28T21:23:34	I want to do a quick run-through of why I think Trump will end up looking like Goldwater in November. 1/

JayCostTWS	725745989676601345	2016-04-28T17:58:22	Oh I have plenty of solutions. But I've been consistently outvoted by the hari-kari coalition.  
JayCostTWS	725745709841039360	2016-04-28T17:57:15	Trump swept the delegates at the 1211 Avenue of the Americas caucus. He's untouchable on this stuff now. 
JayCostTWS	725743877160837122	2016-04-28T17:49:58	And if you think I'm going along for the ride, you're nuts. James Madison is *my* spirit animal. I don't truck with this bullshit.
JayCostTWS	725743537665531905	2016-04-28T17:48:37	To return to jbouie's point, only a *debauched* political party would select a man like Donald Trump as its nominee.
JayCostTWS	725743326276767744	2016-04-28T17:47:47	I've put this up before, but it bears repeating. It captures perfectly the 2016 GOP &amp; my reaction to it. 
JayCostTWS	725742297682481152	2016-04-28T17:43:42	I really became aware of the moral rot at the top of the GOP when I wrote RNM. The cowardice in the face of Trump to me is a massive "tell."
JayCostTWS	725741931096080385	2016-04-28T17:42:14	If they are willing to endorse, or at least condone, Trumpism, then they have proven themselves unworthy of the offices they hold.
JayCostTWS	725741637629038593	2016-04-28T17:41:04	And frankly the Republican office-holders who haven't stood up to Trump, for these reasons, can lose for all I care.
JayCostTWS	725741499519012868	2016-04-28T17:40:31	I really doubt it will take that much work to tip Trump over, so then the focus goes to down-ballot races.
JayCostTWS	725741049927323648	2016-04-28T17:38:44	40% of GOP primary voters might be using their presidential vote to express their rage or whatever, but most Americans are *aghast*.
JayCostTWS	725740731718094849	2016-04-28T17:37:28	And HRC is going to pummel Trump on stuff like this. She is going to turn the whole Trump Clown Show against him.
JayCostTWS	725740623546953729	2016-04-28T17:37:02	But as the powers of the executive branch have grown over the last 100 years, the stakes have increased. That is what LBJ was getting at.
JayCostTWS	725740491669671936	2016-04-28T17:36:31	We could have suffered a chief executive like Trump in, say, the 1840s, when the office was mostly a clerkship.
JayCostTWS	725740311092285440	2016-04-28T17:35:48	LBJ was hitting at something fundamentally non-ideological there: Goldwater simply cannot be trusted with the monumental powers of the WH.
JayCostTWS	725740143290777600	2016-04-28T17:35:08	This is why I think the general election is just going to be a six-month version of LBJ's Daisy Ad. 
JayCostTWS	725739664779431936	2016-04-28T17:33:14	Said this today in a conversation. He's not just pro-Putin. He's surrounded himself with folks *tied* to the Kremlin 
JayCostTWS	725739614263230464	2016-04-28T17:33:02	All of these problems are *first* in my order of importance to ideological questions like tax reform, abortion, Obamacare, etc. etc.

JayCostTWS	725739237639856129	2016-04-28T17:31:32	Four years of Trump turning the government into his tawdry reality show might upend that.
JayCostTWS	725739100930711557	2016-04-28T17:30:59	After that, what about world confidence in the United States? We are so advantaged by the fact that ppl with $ view us as a safe investment.
JayCostTWS	725738968608858112	2016-04-28T17:30:28	After that, what about the nuclear codes? Should Trump have access to them? Of course not.
JayCostTWS	725738747384500225	2016-04-28T17:29:35	For starters, I can't vote for somebody unless I'm 100% certain they are not a stooge for the Russians. Sorry, that's just me.
JayCostTWS	725738532598341633	2016-04-28T17:28:44	There are so many non-ideological tasks that the president does, which we have been able to take for granted. But with Trump we can't.
JayCostTWS	725738290301771776	2016-04-28T17:27:46	The man is *manifestly* unfit to be president of the United States. It's a threshold question before we get to issue positions.
JayCostTWS	725738170579587072	2016-04-28T17:27:18	And for me the NeverTrump position is fundamentally non-ideological. Although there is an ideological component to it, that is secondary.
JayCostTWS	725737952106692608	2016-04-28T17:26:25	Bravo, jbouie. I don't think anybody has put the matter better than this.

JayCostTWS	724777838415630337	2016-04-26T01:51:17	If Cruz named Fiorina the VP nominee Wednesday afternoon, say right after Trump's big f-pol speech, that'd be interesting.

JayCostTWS	724430393391362049	2016-04-25T02:50:39	Yes. Biddle was very bad at politics, but in truth Jackson was going to do what he did eventually.  
JayCostTWS	724429422217052161	2016-04-25T02:46:48	Yes. The Bank under William Jones (1817-1819) did not restrain lending and worsened the Panic of 1819.  
JayCostTWS	724428848868282370	2016-04-25T02:44:31	JoeClarkDeegan BUS = Bank of the United States.
JayCostTWS	724428728021995521	2016-04-25T02:44:02	But the 2nd Bank under Biddle actually functioned as a regulator of the state banks.  
JayCostTWS	724428528570212352	2016-04-25T02:43:15	The  boom was created by a staple shortage in Europe after the Napoleonic Wars. The early Bank didn't help matters. 
JayCostTWS	724428298206482435	2016-04-25T02:42:20	Nicholas Govan's bio of Nicholas Biddle. Also Bray Hammond's Banks &amp; Politics in Antebellum America is a classic.

JayCostTWS	724427278441168896	2016-04-25T02:38:17	The truth is that the Bank was the victim of Jackson's ignorant prejudices, Democratic political calculations ... 17/
JayCostTWS	724427055677464576	2016-04-25T02:37:23	The only way to sustain Webb's argument is by taking Jackson's veto message at face value, and ignore the context altogether. 16/
JayCostTWS	724426809484316675	2016-04-25T02:36:25	And if you kill the BUS and monopolize NY banking ... that's as close to a financial aristocracy as you could get in 1832! 15/
JayCostTWS	724426617758556160	2016-04-25T02:35:39	They already controlled state tax revenue &amp; had a big stake in NYC banks. They wanted rid of the BUS to monopolize NY state banking. 14/

JayCostTWS	724425895650406400	2016-04-25T02:32:47	As a matter of fact, NY was decisive vote to sustain Jackson's veto, &amp; if you look carefully at NY politics, you see a strange alliance. 13/
JayCostTWS	724424178745663488	2016-04-25T02:25:58	So eliminating the 2nd Bank actually **concentrated economic power in Wall Street**. 12/
JayCostTWS	724423837954244609	2016-04-25T02:24:36	Wall Street also did not appreciate that tax revenue from the Port of NYC went into the Bank coffers, to be held by Philadelphians. 11/
JayCostTWS	724423718550802432	2016-04-25T02:24:08	Why? Because Wall Street was a rising power of finance, but the Bank was in Philadelphia, and controlled by Philadelphians. 10/
JayCostTWS	724423601949151232	2016-04-25T02:23:40	Now let's talk about the supposed "aristocracy" that Jackson destroyed with the veto. Guess who wanted the BUS gone ... WALL STREET! 9/
JayCostTWS	724423412765069312	2016-04-25T02:22:55	So, the south and west (i.e. the Jacksonians!) reaped enormous benefits from it, as evidenced by testimonials in support of recharter. 8/

JayCostTWS	724423046870777856	2016-04-25T02:21:28	It's a testament to his brilliance that the Bank was almost repealed in the early 1820s to being overwhelmingly reauthorized in 1832. 6/
JayCostTWS	724422832122417157	2016-04-25T02:20:36	And he did all of this, by the way, when the Bank's reputation was in the toilet, after having been terribly managed from 1817-1823. 5/

JayCostTWS	720432806166470657	2016-04-14T02:05:40	The main draw of Pittsburgh for industry was the rivers, which were enormously useful for moving heavy stuff ... 100 years ago.

JayCostTWS	716690964635516928	2016-04-03T18:16:56	In all, 2/3rd of official NDGOP slate looks anti-Trump to varying degree, while 1/8th looks pro-Trump. 8/8
JayCostTWS	716690385230290945	2016-04-03T18:14:37	Further worth noting that Rep. Cramer—who endorsed Trump—would've had an automatic slot on the official slate had he asked for it. 7/
JayCostTWS	716690049048387584	2016-04-03T18:13:17	Also worth noting that Benn Koppelman is on the Cruz slate, and his mom is on the official NDGOP slate. 6/
JayCostTWS	716689666787901441	2016-04-03T18:11:46	In contrast, observers have only found 3 on the official slate who are either pro-Trump or leaning Trump. 5/
JayCostTWS	716689504208363523	2016-04-03T18:11:07	So figure that of the 25 names on the official slate, 14 are either on the Cruz slate, anti-Trump or top tier officeholders. 4/
JayCostTWS	716689217343070208	2016-04-03T18:09:59	So  Cruz slate lines up w/ NDGOP slate on 11/23 names. On top of that, observers have found another 2 on GOP slate who are anti-Trump. 3/
JayCostTWS	716688883937837058	2016-04-03T18:08:40	The difference, presumably, is Gov Dalyrmple and AG Stenehjem. They're not endorsing and Cruz wouldn't put up against them. 2/

JayCostTWS	706609191557922816	2016-03-06T22:35:34	The RCP average for MI has Trump in the lead, but it is bad for his quest to get to 1,237. All four are over 15% threshold.
JayCostTWS	706607553334091776	2016-03-06T22:29:03	MS could be good. MI will be a split. But I think ID HI and DC will be bad for him.
JayCostTWS	706607446597496833	2016-03-06T22:28:38	We'll see how things flush out, but b/ now and 3/15 I do not think Trump wins more than 40% of the total delegates available.

JayCostTWS	706604603413041153	2016-03-06T22:17:20	RocksEm They have to be placed in nomination.
JayCostTWS	706604527726755844	2016-03-06T22:17:02	ericheggie Taniel Ben Ginsberg did exactly this in 2012.
JayCostTWS	706603790003208192	2016-03-06T22:14:06	So Jeb, Carly, Huck's delegates are going as free agents to Cleveland (assuming their names aren't placed in nomination).
JayCostTWS	706603607869804545	2016-03-06T22:13:22	BTW I'm pretty sure that a delegate for a candidate whose name is not placed in nomination is unbound.
JayCostTWS	706598371839107072	2016-03-06T21:52:34	On top of this, there are another 72 delegates from the U.S. Virgin Islands, Wyoming, and Colorado that may go to Cleveland unbound.
JayCostTWS	706594478434426880	2016-03-06T21:37:06	I'm the guy who thought Romney would win in 12. Not really a go-to source on the odds. I'm here for color commentary 
JayCostTWS	706590814403563520	2016-03-06T21:22:32	To repeat, this count is more pessimistic for Trump because I'm already factoring in the delegates he *cannot* win.
JayCostTWS	706590504234983424	2016-03-06T21:21:18	And next week is not a great look for him overall. MI will spread out. HI &amp; ID probably bad. MS good but proportional.
JayCostTWS	706590380687499264	2016-03-06T21:20:49	Right now he has to hit 57% of delegates. If he gets, say, 40% of delegates on 3/8, he'll have to win closer to 60% going forward then.
JayCostTWS	706590254560583680	2016-03-06T21:20:19	Also, given the profile of the 3/8 contests, I expect Trump's hill is going to get steeper moving forward.
JayCostTWS	706587350600687616	2016-03-06T21:08:46	Of the remaining delegates that can be bound, Trump would have to win 57% of them.
JayCostTWS	706585740004761600	2016-03-06T21:02:22	Current Delegate Breakdown Trump 391 (39%)  Cruz 304 (30%)  Rubio 148 (15%)  Unbound/Other 126 (12%)  Kasich 37 (4%)
JayCostTWS	706584849268785153	2016-03-06T20:58:50	While I'm at it, I should also place PA district delegates on unallocated list. They will be unaffiliated, too. Standby for a new count.
JayCostTWS	706584286745464832	2016-03-06T20:56:36	CO had precinct caucuses to choose delegates to county assemblies and district conventions.  
JayCostTWS	706583772502822912	2016-03-06T20:54:33	And they add up almost to the amount of total delegates he won in SC. So it's not chump change.
JayCostTWS	706583547407110144	2016-03-06T20:53:40	...So you may as well count them against his total now, even if they are not chosen for a few months.
JayCostTWS	706583448249573376	2016-03-06T20:53:16	Anyway the point is a minor one, but it is something to bear in mind: Trump cannot "win" delegates in ND, Guam, and American Samoa...
JayCostTWS	706583189574303744	2016-03-06T20:52:14	FHQ Yep. 46. Derp. ArithmeticIsHard

JayCostTWS	706582335492329472	2016-03-06T20:48:51	They will be chosen by conventions or caucuses, and can be sent unbound to Cleveland.
JayCostTWS	706582103216037888	2016-03-06T20:47:55	Additionally, there are 75 delegates who *may* go unbound from Colorado, Virgin Islands, and Wyoming.
JayCostTWS	706581772750995457	2016-03-06T20:46:36	So I'd say the count is: Trump 391 (41%) Cruz 304 (32%) Rubio 148 (16%) other/uncommitted 70 (7%) Kasich 37 (4%)
JayCostTWS	706581386874978304	2016-03-06T20:45:04	They haven't been selected yet, but that does not matter for our purposes. ND, Guam, and American Samoa. Total of 44 delegates.
JayCostTWS	706581021714735104	2016-03-06T20:43:37	If we're doing delegate counts, we should remember that several places will go unbound to Cleveland. 
JayCostTWS	706577927073304578	2016-03-06T20:31:20	So Trump won less than 30% of the delegates this week.

JayCostTWS	706339850354614272	2016-03-06T04:45:18	And importantly nobody at that convention will have been involved in anything like this before. Closest corollary was 1976.
JayCostTWS	706339746587529216	2016-03-06T04:44:53	Bottom line: if nobody fails to get a clear victory, the power to decide shifts—from the voters to the state party leaders.
JayCostTWS	706339572477722624	2016-03-06T04:44:11	Go back and look at the 1880 contest over the unit rule. Or 1952 over whether contested delegates could vote on procedural matters.
JayCostTWS	706339288074555392	2016-03-06T04:43:04	EVERYTHING will be contested. EVERY LAST THING.

JayCostTWS	706333869348429824	2016-03-06T04:21:32	I have Trump with 52 delegates for tonight.
JayCostTWS	706333219352928257	2016-03-06T04:18:57	norunnyeggs Indeed. I'm just gaming it out. The longer we have a three-or-more split, the more dangerous it is for NeverTrump.
JayCostTWS	706332876632137728	2016-03-06T04:17:35	If there is a Trump collapse in MI like there was in LA, Kasich will be the primary beneficiary.
JayCostTWS	706332618124566528	2016-03-06T04:16:33	HAHA Kasich ain't gonna leave. If those NKY #'s hold, he's going to crush it in Ohio on 3/15.  
JayCostTWS	706332427883585536	2016-03-06T04:15:48	Doesn't make much difference tonight, but a huge problem in a split field in California, New Jersey, Wisconsin.  
JayCostTWS	706331907294961664	2016-03-06T04:13:44	Trump is a fool for this. Rubio voters aren't going to go to Trump. They'll reallocate to Cruz and Kasich. 
JayCostTWS	706330052150075393	2016-03-06T04:06:22	I hope that this is where we are in the 2016 GOP primary story. 
JayCostTWS	706329021353738240	2016-03-06T04:02:16	FALSE. The "establishment" adopted primaries under the belief they could manipulate low-info voters.

JayCostTWS	706236321887625217	2016-03-05T21:53:55	Henry Clay would defeat Trump @ Cleveland with a winking smile, regardless of "pledged" delegates. 100 years later ppl would celebrate it.
JayCostTWS	706235256505044992	2016-03-05T21:49:41	And here is my effort to nudge the Overton Window: if Rule 40 can be done away with, so can Rule 16. Think on it.
JayCostTWS	706235097700294656	2016-03-05T21:49:03	Trump is going to be shocked when all his IA "delegates" vote for Cruz on every procedural matter on the floor.
JayCostTWS	706234508593524737	2016-03-05T21:46:42	So if Cruz is out-organizing pretty much everybody at the caucuses, how do you think he'll do at the state committee meetings?
JayCostTWS	706233881842872320	2016-03-05T21:44:13	Book it a week early. The Rules Committee markup is going to be NUTS.  
JayCostTWS	706233647699992576	2016-03-05T21:43:17	I am guessing every state from TX to SD will go against him. And I'm sure the unallocated ND delegates will, too. 
JayCostTWS	706233388722745344	2016-03-05T21:42:15	My grandmother (and probably yours, too) called this pennywise and pound foolish.

JayCostTWS	706232880603774976	2016-03-05T21:40:14	ForecasterEnten Gotta figure that Overland Park will help Kasich get to 10%.
JayCostTWS	706232531402756097	2016-03-05T21:38:51	Also LA has some GONZO allocation rules. Could see a big swath of delegates go unpledged, i.e. in pocket of LA GOP.
JayCostTWS	706232238636142598	2016-03-05T21:37:41	Cruz will hold his own in KY and LA. Rubio should sweep PR. Bad weekend for fascism.
JayCostTWS	706231173693878272	2016-03-05T21:33:27	So as of now, Cruz has won Portland area caucus, Hancock County, Kennebec County, Lincoln County, Waldo County.
JayCostTWS	706230955241897985	2016-03-05T21:32:35	Told Cruz has also officially won Lincoln Cty, Maine.

JayCostTWS	706230988058304512	2016-03-05T21:32:43	PatrickRuffini justkarl They may or may not be. They go unbound to Cleveland.
JayCostTWS	706230911860346880	2016-03-05T21:32:25	So apparently Wichita had 2 things to do today: chew gum and beat the crap out of realDonaldTrump....

JayCostTWS	705154139463028736	2016-03-02T22:13:42	So basically the RNC will be governed temporarily by Rules 26-42. What do those rules say?
JayCostTWS	705154021640773632	2016-03-02T22:13:14	Let's take a gander of the RNC rules. The very last rule says this. 
JayCostTWS	705153594547380227	2016-03-02T22:11:32	I'm going to put two items out there for people to mull on as we start staring down the barrel of 3/15.

JayCostTWS	705147097889300480	2016-03-02T21:45:43	Also:  Most of these delegates have not even been chosen yet.  
JayCostTWS	705147048237072384	2016-03-02T21:45:31	Also: these delegate slates can be contested.  They will be contested. You watch.  
JayCostTWS	705146880318115844	2016-03-02T21:44:51	Just going to put this out there:  By rule, these delegates are sovereign at the RNC.  They can do what they want.  
JayCostTWS	705133930765225985	2016-03-02T20:53:24	Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams did the right thing.

JayCostTWS	705075626495967232	2016-03-02T17:01:43	So many of the so-called cons pundits have jumped onto Trump bandwagon by not denouncing his lack of conservatism. Silence is complicity.

JayCostTWS	705069239888171008	2016-03-02T16:36:20	It's possible Trump himself is not a virulent racist. But there is no question he relies upon racism to drive up his vote totals.
JayCostTWS	704862672928579586	2016-03-02T02:55:31	Notice that he kept saying "I disavow" over and over again, but never said "I disavow David Duke" or "Disavow white supremacist groups"
JayCostTWS	705069010295984128	2016-03-02T16:35:26	The delegate math is amazing. 63% of Trumps delegates come from 5 southern states (GA, TN, AL, SC, AR)

JayCostTWS	704955026465230848	2016-03-02T09:02:30	Cruz &amp; Rubio need a gentleman's agreement. Defer to the other strategically. Whoever winds up w/ most delegates at top of ticket. Other VP.

JayCostTWS	704885500293877760	2016-03-02T04:26:14	An open question for intrepid journalists: is Trump following up on these state conventions where they actually select the delegates?
JayCostTWS	704885349416361984	2016-03-02T04:25:38	FHQ Nate_Cohn John Yob made that argument in his book. Makes sense strategically for them to file unbound.
JayCostTWS	704884604667305984	2016-03-02T04:22:40	FHQ Nate_Cohn Isn't it smart for them to register as unbound?

JayCostTWS	704880603062210560	2016-03-02T04:06:46	And by the way, if you think it absurd that the Virgin Islands should have such importance, I agree. 
JayCostTWS	704880478940172289	2016-03-02T04:06:16	Also of importance are the delegates that are unbound at the convention. ND and a bunch of territories. HUGELY important.
JayCostTWS	704880276837683200	2016-03-02T04:05:28	And yes. If they prefer to deny Trump the nomination by unbinding themselves, the will.
JayCostTWS	704880149553135616	2016-03-02T04:04:58	It may be the case that Trump can keep any infiltrators out of his delegate coalition, but Cruz has proven himself ... ahem ... wily.
JayCostTWS	704880009228492801	2016-03-02T04:04:24	Why more? The delegates can vote to unbind themselves on the convention floor. And Trump's delegates are not bound on that vote ;-)
JayCostTWS	704879906904268800	2016-03-02T04:04:00	This is a huge deal. My feeling is that Trump has to pull a clean 1,237—probably more—to win.  
JayCostTWS	704879688724975616	2016-03-02T04:03:08	Not necessarily. The delegates to the convention are sovereign on this matter. 
JayCostTWS	704879438643765248	2016-03-02T04:02:08	That could change on 3/15, when somebody (cough cough Romney) would have to decide. But I agree. 
JayCostTWS	704878949776683008	2016-03-02T04:00:12	This. And we should keep Kasich in as a bulwark in Ohio.   Carson has to be shown the door.

JayCostTWS	704873153449893889	2016-03-02T03:37:10	If Kasich wins OH and Rubio wins FL (big if's I know), then Trump is probably skunked to 1,237.
