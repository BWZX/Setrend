ryanavent	726045891061272576	2016-04-29T13:50:04	Congratulations to London, which is currently experiencing every kind of weather simultaneously.
ryanavent	726029147307429892	2016-04-29T12:43:32	nick_bunker Better target 5% NGDP growth just to be on the safe side.
ryanavent	725989147639439360	2016-04-29T10:04:35	Fed tries to prepare markets for June hike -&gt; Markets fall -&gt; No June hike -&gt; No September hike either. 
ryanavent	725983476990763008	2016-04-29T09:42:03	t0nyyates Maybe. It would be cheeky if the BoE bought lots of euro-zone bonds.
ryanavent	725983254449426432	2016-04-29T09:41:10	t0nyyates It is hard to tell! As a neoliberal squish, I wish it were easier to show that liberalisation does what we say it does.
ryanavent	725982083764609024	2016-04-29T09:36:31	t0nyyates There is a risk that Brexit will empower bad leaders who make lots of *other* bad decisions. But that's a risk of staying, too.
ryanavent	725981896451219456	2016-04-29T09:35:46	t0nyyates Maybe Brexit would be different. But we're talking about going to the EU's external tariff, not Smoot-Hawley.
ryanavent	725981739605172224	2016-04-29T09:35:09	t0nyyates A 10% shortfall in GDP is simply massive. Britain fought wars and lost empires without going through that.
ryanavent	725981519160987648	2016-04-29T09:34:16	t0nyyates But a big depreciation is a pretty good way to avoid a nasty demand shock.
ryanavent	725981351929872384	2016-04-29T09:33:37	t0nyyates My rule of thumb is to see what has happened in the past. In the past, it takes nasty demand shocks to generate big, long slumps.
ryanavent	725981170324934656	2016-04-29T09:32:53	t0nyyates The second point is that as much as we might wish to find big growth effects for "good" policies, they are damnably elusive.
ryanavent	725981015789981696	2016-04-29T09:32:16	t0nyyates There would be adjustment costs, as I acknowledge. But they would be greatly facilitated by a falling pound.
ryanavent	725980900656332800	2016-04-29T09:31:49	t0nyyates Two points. First, the WTO scenario wouldn't be that bad. America trades heavily with Europe.
ryanavent	725975453006176257	2016-04-29T09:10:10	But, our princess is in another castle.

ryanavent	725973414314426368	2016-04-29T09:02:04	I don't want this tweet storm to end on 13. /14
ryanavent	725973340775653376	2016-04-29T09:01:47	Anyway, those are my thoughts. Brexit = costly and dumb, but running around saying "megadepression" is misleading and unhelpful. /13
ryanavent	725972971345563648	2016-04-29T09:00:18	(Not least b/c there is a small chance Brexit -&gt; EU breakup -&gt; bad things like war.) /12
ryanavent	725972726066860032	2016-04-29T08:59:20	But it would still be a REALLY, REALLY stupid thing to do. /11
ryanavent	725972642956742656	2016-04-29T08:59:00	If the BoE is doing its job, Brexit would make Britain a little poorer, but it wouldn't be an economic catastrophe. /10
ryanavent	725972392175099904	2016-04-29T08:58:00	Or really awful monetary policy or invasion. Any of which COULD happen. But that's not what the 10%ers are arguing. /9
ryanavent	725972256166412288	2016-04-29T08:57:28	You can get to losses like that, but not through lost trade, or even lost migration. You need total political meltdown the UK... /8
ryanavent	725972004302671872	2016-04-29T08:56:28	And it's weird to me that lots of serious econ folks are taking estimates like that seriously. /7
ryanavent	725971798098083840	2016-04-29T08:55:39	There'd be costs; Britons would be a bit poorer than they otherwise would. But it is wildly implausible that Brexit -&gt; 10% loss of GDP. /6
ryanavent	725971504618438656	2016-04-29T08:54:29	But in that spirit, and as the column says, I don't much care for incredibly dire forecasts about the economic costs of Brexit. /5
ryanavent	725971305460277248	2016-04-29T08:53:41	Like: "Good ideas do not need lots of lies told about them in order to gain acceptance." Right? So don't Brexit. /4
ryanavent	725971117551308800	2016-04-29T08:52:56	But there are other reasons, many of which are captured nicely in the principles of dsquareddigest's 1-min MBA: 
ryanavent	725970904459661312	2016-04-29T08:52:06	A big reason is that it's really stupid to alienate and turn your back on big, important countries you can't help being located next to. /2
ryanavent	725970716844261376	2016-04-29T08:51:21	So, my column this week is about Brexit. I think Brexit would be really daft for all sorts of reasons.  /1

ryanavent	724517633824010241	2016-04-25T08:37:19	s1moncox I don't think those are the reasons economies suffer long slumps.

ryanavent	724493608565510144	2016-04-25T07:01:51	s1moncox Ok, but history suggests this process is really hard, and rarely works without a big depreciation. You think they'll manage it?
ryanavent	724489573410152448	2016-04-25T06:45:49	s1moncox Seems like the political constraints pushing them toward lousy policy now might inhibit perfect policy making later.

ryanavent	707034464719904772	2016-03-08T02:45:27	Noahpinion It's a good column, imo
ryanavent	707034137547382785	2016-03-08T02:44:09	Noahpinion It does says firms will need to deleverage, and that while the gov could prevent a downturn with good policy, it probably won't.
ryanavent	707033745480617985	2016-03-08T02:42:35	Noahpinion I mean, the column says China is not likely to experience a conventional debt crisis.
ryanavent	707032887967801344	2016-03-08T02:39:11	Noahpinion I'm not mad at all. I just think it's weird that you say my piece says something it doesn't.
ryanavent	707032227952074752	2016-03-08T02:36:33	Noahpinion But for the record, I do not subscribe to your folk theory of recessions.
ryanavent	707031759284736001	2016-03-08T02:34:42	Noahpinion As I said, it's a principled stand against reading the accompanying text that you're taking, and one can only applaud it.
ryanavent	707030027959988224	2016-03-08T02:27:49	Noahpinion I admire your strong commitment to attributing arguments to me that I don't make.
ryanavent	707029713097781249	2016-03-08T02:26:34	Noahpinion The chart is not exhaustive. The title on the chart is misleading. I didn't choose it.
ryanavent	707029487758790657	2016-03-08T02:25:40	Noahpinion It does if you read the bleeding piece, Noah.
ryanavent	707029347337687042	2016-03-08T02:25:07	Noahpinion The graph makes sense in the context of the piece.
ryanavent	707029156131966976	2016-03-08T02:24:21	Noahpinion The piece is about dynamics of deleveraging in China, and the chart shows other cases in which bad debts led to deleveraging.
ryanavent	707028533474926592	2016-03-08T02:21:52	Noahpinion I wrote the piece, and I certainly don't think that expansions require a rise in debt that eventually leads to a crash.
ryanavent	707027368188256256	2016-03-08T02:17:15	Noahpinion The article says that China's NFCs have lots of debt of increasingly poor quality, and they will soon need to deleverage.
ryanavent	707026548231118849	2016-03-08T02:13:59	Noahpinion The article didn't "hedge a lot". It described a completely different dynamic.
ryanavent	707025791654236160	2016-03-08T02:10:59	Noahpinion Noah, this is disappointing. Did you read the column or just look at the chart? It does not say what you claim it says.
ryanavent	706802216129204224	2016-03-07T11:22:34	Noahpinion Also, the chart doesn't show that debt always falls in a downturn. (It includes Japan.)
ryanavent	706801782446493696	2016-03-07T11:20:51	Noahpinion Debt is "too much" when income is growing too slowly to service debt.
ryanavent	706801426471768065	2016-03-07T11:19:26	Noahpinion You should read the column.

ryanavent	702810957102325760	2016-02-25T11:02:44	When the president can enact what he wants, what he wants matters enormously.
ryanavent	702810899531374592	2016-02-25T11:02:30	Of course, the president's values matter. In a government in which the prez has safe Congressional majorities, they are most of what matter.
ryanavent	702810801690812416	2016-02-25T11:02:07	Obama got things wrong during his 2008 campaign, but his system's operation spoke volumes about his ability to handle great responsibility.
ryanavent	702810615258206208	2016-02-25T11:01:22	Consistently good or bad performance of an organisation during a campaign is a good indicator of how it might function in office.
ryanavent	702810450560458752	2016-02-25T11:00:43	Execs build organisations. Organisations channel info to decision points. The system's output is “campaign strategy” or “governance”.
ryanavent	702810213020246016	2016-02-25T10:59:47	Rather, Ezra is saying (or I would say) that in both cases, the structure and operation of the decision-making apparatus is key.
ryanavent	702810133387206657	2016-02-25T10:59:28	I don’t think Ezra is arguing that campaigns are good guides to presidencies because the goals and constraints of the two are similar.

ryanavent	694850252940124160	2016-02-03T11:49:44	The Fed is hiking b/c they're *really worried* inflation might rise and stay *so high* they'd need to induce a recession to bring it down!
ryanavent	694849977881878528	2016-02-03T11:48:39	I'm worried they're going to stubbornly plow ahead with that view until the economy is in a ditch.
ryanavent	694849715880464384	2016-02-03T11:47:36	The Fed's world view right now (or Fischer's at least) is so firmly planted in a past that doesn't apply anymore.
ryanavent	694849450188148736	2016-02-03T11:46:33	The rate path projected by fed funds futures is *super flat*. If the Fed were to actually go in March, all hell would break loose.
ryanavent	694848992224624640	2016-02-03T11:44:44	So, TimDuy reckons *March* might still be on the table for Hike 2. Mkts are betting on 1 hike this year, in autumn. 
ryanavent	692748572878639104	2016-01-28T16:38:25	Henry_Curr The Economist argued against the hike for asymmetry of risk reasons: b/c if mkts swoon for any reason, Fed can't easily respond.
ryanavent	692748361103994880	2016-01-28T16:37:34	Henry_Curr But even if the market is panicking for reasons totally unrelated to the December hike, that doesn't mean the hike made sense.
ryanavent	692747690787131392	2016-01-28T16:34:54	Henry_Curr It's not dead-certain that they are. But they are far more consistent with "Fed screwed up" than with "Fed nailed it".
ryanavent	692747270417207296	2016-01-28T16:33:14	Henry_Curr If you'd like to argue that goings on are not related to the hike, then go for it.
