jamiepastore	707003828634136576	2016-03-08T00:43:42	prchovanec It was always an uphill climb. It’s difficult when the top people are friends and state level operatives, too
jamiepastore	707003625839591425	2016-03-08T00:42:54	prchovanec That was just poor management. Romney cleaned up Olympics w/gusto so I wasn’t too concerned about his character (just a bad pol)

jamiepastore	705963479056822272	2016-03-05T03:49:44	sknthla AI could speed up what individual stores buy, but it seems like other stores would be silly to be Me2 stores rather than different
jamiepastore	705963207588859904	2016-03-05T03:48:39	sknthla I think It would be hard to have a market that isn't ultimately self defeating when it takes place in a dynamic system
jamiepastore	705962951165935616	2016-03-05T03:47:38	sknthla Like if Store A uses AI to predict trends, store B uses a smarter system, store C could sell less trendy items to stand out right?
jamiepastore	705962490090237952	2016-03-05T03:45:48	sknthla What I'm saying is: are there limits to how much systems can predict that will be popular before trends change just to be different
jamiepastore	705962040939053056	2016-03-05T03:44:01	sknthla And if item A was popular and AI predicts item B will be 'next big thing' so stores load up on B, the trendy buy could be item C

jamiepastore	705961632099233793	2016-03-05T03:42:23	sknthla Basically my bottom line is there is always a market to be made by going against what is or has been popular
jamiepastore	705961450410409984	2016-03-05T03:41:40	sknthla More that AI will model future behavior on previous and current actions, but they change Ina dynamic way. Not just stripes or plaid

jamiepastore	705958577920303105	2016-03-05T03:30:15	sknthla I'm not conveying this as well as I mean, but going back to EMH analogy, there'd always be another retailer betting opposite way

jamiepastore	705957350897627136	2016-03-05T03:25:23	@5wicher5 Second mortgages were pushed on customers during an era of rising prices, less societal chagrin about debt. We're all to blame

jamiepastore	705956818460102656	2016-03-05T03:23:16	sknthla And if it can, wouldn't another AI system see an opportunity in going the other way than the majority of the systems?
jamiepastore	705956665506435073	2016-03-05T03:22:39	sknthla And if price rises it changed behavior- fools rush in, the former greedy get fearful etc. Can AI model psycho-social bubbles?
