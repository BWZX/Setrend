markminervini	725400674184241152	2016-04-27T19:06:12	Interview with Mark Minervini -- 
markminervini	725386616097796096	2016-04-27T18:10:20	When you go from outcome to process you live in the now and achieve great moments. Forget the score - do the right thing and you will win
markminervini	725385787722727424	2016-04-27T18:07:03	What takes up a largest part of your heart will take up the largest part of your time; let love and passion guide you.
markminervini	725385527239708672	2016-04-27T18:06:01	Build your skills and then rely on them.  No one cares about your money or your future like you do.
markminervini	725385489935556608	2016-04-27T18:05:52	Smart people learn from mistakes; really smart people learn from other people's mistakes, and in turn make smaller mistakes of their own.
markminervini	725385318329786368	2016-04-27T18:05:11	Everyone has a champion trader inside them -- it's just a matter of knowledge, nurture, desire and commitment.
markminervini	725026678100078593	2016-04-26T18:20:05	Awesome... great to hear!  
markminervini	725014835012886528	2016-04-26T17:33:01	Trying to post a replay of the Apr 6 webinar w/ David Ryan and myself. Having technical issues w/ the recording - trying to work it out
markminervini	725009885264367616	2016-04-26T17:13:21	Ask powerful questions, get powerful answers -- ask crappy question, get crappy answers. It's a matter of how you communicate with yourself.
markminervini	725009399123562501	2016-04-26T17:11:25	Next time you make a bad trade or make a blunder, instead of asking "how could I do such a thing!" - ask, what can I learn from this?
markminervini	725009084911509504	2016-04-26T17:10:10	Everyone makes mistakes. It's what you do with that information that separates the super successful from everyone else.
markminervini	725008730085945344	2016-04-26T17:08:45	A mistake is a valuable teacher... a failure is when you quit or refuse to learn from your mistakes.
markminervini	725007957243650049	2016-04-26T17:05:41	Change happens in an instant, it's the decision to change that takes all the time. Decide to decide! 
markminervini	725007088611512320	2016-04-26T17:02:14	When you get to a point where you are patient and only take quality trades, you’ve decided you're in it NOT for action but to make money
markminervini	725005765698682880	2016-04-26T16:56:59	The key to making confident buys exactly at the right moment is to go in knowing your exact stop loss point beforehand.
markminervini	725005302676869120	2016-04-26T16:55:08	If trading is making you lose sleep, you're probably trading too large for your own comfort level. Sell down to the sleeping point.
markminervini	725005212604223488	2016-04-26T16:54:47	The only chance one has to last in the business of speculation is to respect risk; those who don't disappear.

markminervini	724967403566698499	2016-04-26T14:24:32	OLED - stock has held up well post recent base breakout - undercut of recent low would be normal and create a shakeout - I'm still holding
markminervini	724966644150202369	2016-04-26T14:21:31	EDU -- stock has held up amazingly - I still hold my position with a back-stop to protect a more than 20% profit.
markminervini	724965884079435779	2016-04-26T14:18:30	Based on the level of built up technical momentum and a lack of overly bullish sentiment, a market pullback should be contained to 3-5%.

markminervini	719935072300695552	2016-04-12T17:07:51	The best sign is when a stock is hard to buy. The worst sign is when a stock breaks and can't rally. Beware when they let you in easily.
markminervini	719933775254200321	2016-04-12T17:02:42	Slower start this week - as of today, we only added 13 names to our buy alert list this week --

markminervini	715608258921238528	2016-03-31T18:34:38	If you're not successful, you're doing something wrong. Don't just keep doing the same thing over and over; study where you're going wrong.
markminervini	715608080726302721	2016-03-31T18:33:56	You may be surprised at how many misconceptions you may have. We tend to congregate around our personal feelings and opinions.
markminervini	715607765440397312	2016-03-31T18:32:41	We are NOT born natural traders; to the contrary. To become a great trader you must learn to make the unnatural become axiomatic and natural

markminervini	715192565696446465	2016-03-30T15:02:49	If you want to produce alpha, trade alpha. For those who take the time to understand this concept, there's a fortune in this sentence.
markminervini	715192309235601409	2016-03-30T15:01:48	If your portfolio is going up and down with the indexes in lock-step, you're not likely to produce alpha or big returns with low risk.

markminervini	714527607346171905	2016-03-28T19:00:31	To become a great trader that stands the test of time, it's important you start by learning how to keep your risk to an absolute minimum.
markminervini	714527439896993792	2016-03-28T18:59:51	If you find yourself hoping your stocks get back to break even repeatedly, it's not a great market, or your selection criteria are flawed.
markminervini	714527227417726976	2016-03-28T18:59:00	Tune out the media and distractions that  cloud your judgment. Your job is to keep your thinking pure and focused on what matters.
markminervini	714526952221048832	2016-03-28T18:57:55	A sound plan is only as good as your ability to execute it with emotional discipline. Without that, even the best strategy will fail.
markminervini	714526788035063808	2016-03-28T18:57:16	Start with a process; a plan, ANY PLAN, but have a plan. Then you have the basis from which to work from, make adjustments and perfect.
markminervini	714526524968345600	2016-03-28T18:56:13	When you're faced with a tough decision, remember, success requires that you do what most people are unwilling to do, and then JUST DO IT!

markminervini	710913510427873280	2016-03-18T19:39:23	Once the market bottoms and accumulation dominates distribution, you stop looking at the indexes and focus your on individual stocks.
markminervini	710913321193439232	2016-03-18T19:38:38	The persistent overbought condition is a positive, not a negative. The key to playing this is to focus on the stocks.
markminervini	710912919257505792	2016-03-18T19:37:02	This move off the lows has been a typical "Lockout Rally" that pounds the shorts and refuses to give up much ground.

markminervini	710550096673288192	2016-03-17T19:35:19	Some of the purest traders become un-pure once they succeed and think they're smart. Don't be smart, be disciplined and have a good plan.

markminervini	710496340145364992	2016-03-17T16:01:42	If the market is healthy and a new up leg has indeed begun, the next market pullback should be contained to about 3-5%.
markminervini	710496024742252544	2016-03-17T16:00:27	The NASDAQ Composite – should it rally up to the 200 day line – will run into some short term trouble as it approaches the 4900-5000 area.
markminervini	710495967750053888	2016-03-17T16:00:13	Stocks are holding up relatively well; the market will likely rally more and pound the shorts, but we have overhead supply to contend with.
markminervini	710495572717744128	2016-03-17T15:58:39	Strategy, a special indicator or computer screen is not the issue. Discipline, commitment are persistence are the real keys to success.
markminervini	710495132626214912	2016-03-17T15:56:54	Most investors either have no discipline at all, or they fail to adhere to their own rules and plan.
markminervini	710494512225906688	2016-03-17T15:54:26	What seems logical and obvious to most often fails. The key is to learn how to think for yourself outside the crowd and the noise.
markminervini	710494271581921280	2016-03-17T15:53:29	Markets almost always move to extremes; expensive gets more expensive and cheap gets even cheaper.  Has been that way and will always be.

markminervini	708317135924281344	2016-03-11T15:42:19	I would rather have a small pos in a thin stock that makes a big move than a big pos in a stock that is over owned. 
markminervini	708316673896542210	2016-03-11T15:40:29	Must have very strong momentum built up coming out of a base in a group that no earnings makes sense, like biotech. 
markminervini	708316326234877952	2016-03-11T15:39:06	Keep in mind, my average stop is much less than 10%. I almost never allow a stock to drop more than 8%.

markminervini	707987762285248513	2016-03-10T17:53:30	fredhingTrader Yes, I'm aware of that. So, you want to discourage risk capital?  We obviously don't agree, so let's leave it at that.
markminervini	707979055782449153	2016-03-10T17:18:55	The best breakouts are the ones that don't give up too much and are "hard to buy"- simply put, buy tennis balls and sell eggs.
markminervini	707978635760656384	2016-03-10T17:17:15	The current environment is still a dangerous one. OME highlight the dangers of NOT adhering to a stop. Looks great, then it doesn't...
markminervini	707977972121075715	2016-03-10T17:14:36	The key here is - if the market pulls in - how well stocks hold, and if constructive setups can proliferate. It’s time to observe closely.
markminervini	707977626661486593	2016-03-10T17:13:14	With the Dow reversing off the 200-day and major indexes near significant overhead supply, the averages could easily pull back 3-5%.

markminervini	704321985170448384	2016-02-29T15:07:01	Tune out the news media.  Your goal as a trader should be to get to a point where you don't need to listen to anyone.
markminervini	704321984725798913	2016-02-29T15:07:01	If you're not successful, you're doing something wrong. Don't just keep doing the same thing over and over; study where you're going wrong.
markminervini	704321724838359040	2016-02-29T15:05:59	A sound plan is only as good as your ability to execute it with emotional discipline. Without that, even the best strategy will fail.

markminervini	702903350413664256	2016-02-25T17:09:52	I wrote a book that explains this in detail -- 
markminervini	702897420493918208	2016-02-25T16:46:18	A market correction allows you to see which stocks are tennis balls and which ones are eggs. I want to own tennis balls.

markminervini	702534763861532672	2016-02-24T16:45:14	Practice does NOT make perfect; only perfect practice makes perfect. If you're practicing wrong, all you are doing is engraining bad habits.
markminervini	702533483906793473	2016-02-24T16:40:09	To become a great trader that stands the test of time, it's important you start by learning how to keep your risk to an absolute minimum.
markminervini	702532543053074433	2016-02-24T16:36:25	Thoughts create beliefs, beliefs create actions and actions create results.  Hence, you are what you think.  CHOOSE YOUR THOUGHTS CAREFULLY
markminervini	702532239951663104	2016-02-24T16:35:13	Making big money in stocks is all about risk mitigation, patience and knowing when to step on the gas. The rest is fighting for pennies.
markminervini	702532210293760000	2016-02-24T16:35:06	Tune out the news media.  Your goal as a trader should be to get to a point where you don't need to listen to anyone.

markminervini	701793384663371776	2016-02-22T15:39:16	Many people willing to work a 60-hr wk for a paycheck, building someone else’s dream, but won’t work that hard to realize their own dreams
markminervini	701793040541745152	2016-02-22T15:37:54	Problem isn’t finding good information on how to succeed, there’s an abundance of that. What there is a lack of is discipline and commitment
markminervini	701792485064859648	2016-02-22T15:35:41	Ultimately, the only thing that separates a pro from an amateur is consistency.
markminervini	701792278117912578	2016-02-22T15:34:52	Many amateurs start off disciplined, but eventually they deviate and allow one big mistake to destroy months or even years of hard work.
