GavinHJackson	722461480893997057	2016-04-19T16:26:54	hansmollman fine. Here's what I wrote 
GavinHJackson	722459632606834688	2016-04-19T16:19:33	colin93f I cannot remember a time when a single central bank has met their mandate.
GavinHJackson	722459476931002368	2016-04-19T16:18:56	colin93f so maybe they're using biased models. What difference does it make?
GavinHJackson	722458119939485696	2016-04-19T16:13:33	colin93f they have consistently underestimated the amount of slack for the last eight years
GavinHJackson	722456245702168581	2016-04-19T16:06:06	colin93f The Fed today has had to walk back from its earlier hawkishness because it was too inflation-averse.
GavinHJackson	722454996164440064	2016-04-19T16:01:08	colin93f possibly, I don't know. But clearly the current system of central banks is deeply flawed.

GavinHJackson	722452847217000448	2016-04-19T15:52:35	colin93f Do you not think central bankers have a deflationary bias anyway?
GavinHJackson	722452734113357824	2016-04-19T15:52:08	colin93f Even his example "Fed chair Paul Volcker‚Äôs ultimately successful efforts to conquer inflation" shows this.
GavinHJackson	722452339873968130	2016-04-19T15:50:34	colin93f the Fed has clearly failed in its mandate for the last eight years.
GavinHJackson	722452207325573121	2016-04-19T15:50:03	colin93f And I find the traditional argument for central bank independence (to combat inflation bias) a bit silly these days.
GavinHJackson	722451287619563520	2016-04-19T15:46:24	colin93f it's just an audit
GavinHJackson	722448805308796929	2016-04-19T15:36:32	colin93f Being anti central banks seems perfectly reasonable to me, given their record.

GavinHJackson	720740446025216000	2016-04-14T22:28:07	janhopis And likewise anything we do can be backward engineered to have some evolutionary purpose.
GavinHJackson	720740169385713669	2016-04-14T22:27:01	janhopis but obviously anything that we do is going to be reflected in our 'brains' because our 'brains' are us.
GavinHJackson	720739952447864833	2016-04-14T22:26:10	janhopis the interesting stuff is about creating categories out of continua, it makes some argument that this is a feature of our 'brains'

GavinHJackson	720736591312994305	2016-04-14T22:12:48	kadhimshubber janhopis agree with him about what?
GavinHJackson	720736361540624387	2016-04-14T22:11:53	janhopis one could even say that autonomy itself is an instinctive neurological process which has its roots in evolved survival behaviour
GavinHJackson	720736283434336257	2016-04-14T22:11:35	janhopis no contradiction between an instinctive neurological process which has its roots in evolved survival behaviour and autonomy
GavinHJackson	720735362138697728	2016-04-14T22:07:55	janhopis so basically any behaviour?

GavinHJackson	720733913849708545	2016-04-14T22:02:10	janhopis I agree with you that it is not relevant but neither do I think it is obviously true that "we think categorically"

GavinHJackson	720622589731807234	2016-04-14T14:39:48	georgepearkes DuncanWeldon what function do you want the risk free curve to perform other than as a reference price for other securities?
GavinHJackson	720622169768796160	2016-04-14T14:38:08	georgepearkes DuncanWeldon okay, but it still performs the function of a risk free curve
GavinHJackson	720621675885289472	2016-04-14T14:36:10	georgepearkes DuncanWeldon Euro corporate bonds are priced with reference to mid-swaps though. I guess because there is no central gov.
GavinHJackson	720620918087806977	2016-04-14T14:33:10	DuncanWeldon georgepearkes So... here is my question. Do we need a risk free curve? And, if we do, could swaps provide it?
GavinHJackson	720618901248307201	2016-04-14T14:25:09	georgepearkes yeah I agree, it doesn't work. I'm just thinking through why
GavinHJackson	720616984782704641	2016-04-14T14:17:32	georgepearkes but the cash doesn't have to move, it's not like we're all swapping the bond certificates
GavinHJackson	720616627214118912	2016-04-14T14:16:06	georgepearkes yeah I agree, the fed can't use it for mon pol but it does work as a riskless asset

GavinHJackson	720614453193109504	2016-04-14T14:07:28	georgepearkes why? it is just a zero coupon, zero maturity, bond?
GavinHJackson	720614010547224576	2016-04-14T14:05:43	georgepearkes instead of having a % of their assets in treasury bonds just have it in paper money.
GavinHJackson	720613566722764804	2016-04-14T14:03:57	georgepearkes I guess banks could hold more currency? But they'd have to shrink their balance sheets or something

GavinHJackson	719653120783953920	2016-04-11T22:27:29	Sam_Dumitriu anyway good night
GavinHJackson	719652933135020034	2016-04-11T22:26:44	Sam_Dumitriu interesting logic. But it is a little bit too stylised for my tastes.
GavinHJackson	719647165098942465	2016-04-11T22:03:49	Sam_Dumitriu But the general point seems to me more like 'If wages are higher people would work more.'
GavinHJackson	719647129145380866	2016-04-11T22:03:40	Sam_Dumitriu Yeah I can believe the CGT thing in particular.
GavinHJackson	719646867106217985	2016-04-11T22:02:38	Sam_Dumitriu Probably depends on the level and the time frame. I don't know, there's a lot of moving parts.
GavinHJackson	719646513891274752	2016-04-11T22:01:13	Sam_Dumitriu Or whether lower mortgage payments are more stimulative than retirees cutting back.
GavinHJackson	719645060254593025	2016-04-11T21:55:27	Sam_Dumitriu  
GavinHJackson	719642878511853568	2016-04-11T21:46:47	Sam_Dumitriu e.g. Larry Fink was claiming today that lower interest rates have increased saving because people don't want to lose income.
GavinHJackson	719641603191803909	2016-04-11T21:41:43	Sam_Dumitriu depends if the income or substitution effect dominates.
GavinHJackson	719641432722653186	2016-04-11T21:41:02	Sam_Dumitriu the concept of investment in the national accounts is not the same as the tax concept
GavinHJackson	719640519182315520	2016-04-11T21:37:24	stephenkb I suppose I'm thinking of a different model.
GavinHJackson	719640062309306368	2016-04-11T21:35:35	Sam_Dumitriu for example, one of the most profitable investments this year has been gold. Which is essentially just a shiny rock.
GavinHJackson	719639917853327361	2016-04-11T21:35:01	Sam_Dumitriu only if you believe that all investment is capital expenditure. A lot is not.
GavinHJackson	719639462880391168	2016-04-11T21:33:12	stephenkb ah okay, I get you.
GavinHJackson	719639137800871936	2016-04-11T21:31:55	Sam_Dumitriu suppose previously shareholders made ¬£10, they might now make ¬£8 but without the investment have made ¬£6
GavinHJackson	719638748145827841	2016-04-11T21:30:22	Sam_Dumitriu but you may also have reduced the return on equity.
GavinHJackson	719638442582413316	2016-04-11T21:29:09	Sam_Dumitriu I guess my fundamental point is that there are lots of competing stories.
GavinHJackson	719638299464372226	2016-04-11T21:28:35	Sam_Dumitriu it's not mine but then someone comes into my mentions and points to a cafe replacing staff with ipods after a the NLW
GavinHJackson	719637980256841728	2016-04-11T21:27:19	Sam_Dumitriu that's one theory.
GavinHJackson	719637859662176256	2016-04-11T21:26:50	stephenkb oh okay. Maybe I'm naive.
GavinHJackson	719637724467183616	2016-04-11T21:26:18	Sam_Dumitriu they've been cutting interest rates, look in the papers.
GavinHJackson	719637511056846848	2016-04-11T21:25:27	Sam_Dumitriu actually I think the first one of these might be raising the rate of return on capital.
GavinHJackson	719637183095836672	2016-04-11T21:24:09	Sam_Dumitriu one way is getting them to adopt labour saving technologies or reducing the risk free rate in order to get them to take risk
GavinHJackson	719636831390867456	2016-04-11T21:22:45	Sam_Dumitriu some economists, including central bankers, belive you need to lower the rate of return of capital to get more investment.
GavinHJackson	719636061228560384	2016-04-11T21:19:41	Sam_Dumitriu why do some economists believe that a rise in wages is necessary to increase investment or a cut in rates?
GavinHJackson	719635628095365120	2016-04-11T21:17:58	Sam_Dumitriu do you think decreasing capital gains tax will increase investment
GavinHJackson	719634226388320256	2016-04-11T21:12:24	stephenkb then there's the whole other issue of how you put this in context of leadership races and electoral politics but not too much.
GavinHJackson	719633768357765120	2016-04-11T21:10:35	stephenkb have to report on senior politicians tax returns to hold them to amount. Seems like a minefield to me.
GavinHJackson	719633552355291136	2016-04-11T21:09:43	stephenkb the judgement there? I can imagine there's public interest in both but the tax havens seems like the real story to me but you
GavinHJackson	719633363926192128	2016-04-11T21:08:58	stephenkb what extra information do the public need to know. And is it as important as today's announcements about HMRC? How do you make
GavinHJackson	719632898073210880	2016-04-11T21:07:07	stephenkb you've got to add value though. What's the angle? What is the significance?

GavinHJackson	719448232863076353	2016-04-11T08:53:20	TomHale_ so in order to reduce the impetus for reform it is helpful to paint the opposition to tax havens as class warriors and leftists.

GavinHJackson	719441714025467905	2016-04-11T08:27:25	grodaeu it's difficult, I think, because the state/private divide comes from 20th Century battles over welfare state.

GavinHJackson	719163877620060161	2016-04-10T14:03:24	sanderwagner I believe he is. Like Gary Becker, or Foucault.
GavinHJackson	719162414390972417	2016-04-10T13:57:35	sanderwagner I believe Keynes had a history degree too, but I need to check that.
GavinHJackson	719162288444465153	2016-04-10T13:57:05	sanderwagner Adam Smith was chiefly a moral philosopher
GavinHJackson	719161605368492032	2016-04-10T13:54:22	sanderwagner but it's not how he makes his living.
GavinHJackson	719161347116769281	2016-04-10T13:53:21	sanderwagner what is the criteria then? Making models of equilibria that come from optimising participants?
GavinHJackson	719160707951017984	2016-04-10T13:50:48	sanderwagner economists write about social psychology
GavinHJackson	719160370733125632	2016-04-10T13:49:28	sanderwagner he makes his living by writing about economics, which is the criteria. Neither Ostrom nor Kahneman have economics degrees.

GavinHJackson	719124239568265216	2016-04-10T11:25:54	Pete_Spence No I think a) he's an economist and b) he's moderately well known. Maybe Steven Levitt as well.

GavinHJackson	718913525465378816	2016-04-09T21:28:35	toby_n sorry i mean trusts, no funds
GavinHJackson	718913460059435008	2016-04-09T21:28:20	toby_n no? Presumably there are some cases where it is good for funds to be private?
GavinHJackson	718913155276128256	2016-04-09T21:27:07	toby_n I think it's the lobbying thing that might get him in more trouble.

GavinHJackson	718911488224845824	2016-04-09T21:20:30	TintinnyTins a popular guy
GavinHJackson	718910471055794176	2016-04-09T21:16:27	TintinnyTins "what protestors"
GavinHJackson	718909514049785856	2016-04-09T21:12:39	Wonder what putin calls protestors.
GavinHJackson	718833518936268804	2016-04-09T16:10:40	What kind of cartoon villain unironically refers to protestors as "rabble?" Had he already used up his allotment of "pleb" for the year?
GavinHJackson	718906051446337536	2016-04-09T20:58:53	hansmollman the cuckoo clock?
GavinHJackson	718899529391714304	2016-04-09T20:32:58	DawnHFoster I thought today's protest was surprisingly well behaved. No war monuments graffitied or stuff smashed up.
GavinHJackson	718816727455428609	2016-04-09T15:03:57	An IceAge wonder: two ibex skillfully engraved on opposite sides of a single sperm whale tooth in the last glacial. 
GavinHJackson	718891697615335424	2016-04-09T20:01:51	DawnHFoster Oh we're talking past each other, I'm not talking about swearing.
GavinHJackson	718888980259934208	2016-04-09T19:51:03	DawnHFoster deliberate strategy of the government. I don't think they were completely wasting their time.
GavinHJackson	718888821681692678	2016-04-09T19:50:26	DawnHFoster Okay, but there were plenty of allegation of provacateurs on the miners strike and painting the miners as unruly was a
GavinHJackson	718886874891337728	2016-04-09T19:42:41	DawnHFoster I disagree, most people will have never been on a protest.
GavinHJackson	718884594335027200	2016-04-09T19:33:38	DawnHFoster Also why unsympathetic journalists make a big deal of this stuff, easy way to change the conversation and discredit protest
GavinHJackson	718883955617984512	2016-04-09T19:31:05	DawnHFoster I think it does alienate moderates. Why they use agent provocateurs and that.
GavinHJackson	718881903428956160	2016-04-09T19:22:56	aubored so if he wants to be the opposition leader then he has to talk to the press and the press have to try to talk to him.
GavinHJackson	718881687678152706	2016-04-09T19:22:05	aubored unless he is going to do town halls/direct mailers then there is always going to be some journalist in between him and the public
GavinHJackson	718881192855138304	2016-04-09T19:20:07	aubored I just mean that you have to cover things properly and if you can't do it by official channels you have to do it by informal ones.

GavinHJackson	718864134943698944	2016-04-09T18:12:20	Only political anoraks in the UK may hv heard of him, but this is a huge + important story.  
GavinHJackson	718870072014585856	2016-04-09T18:35:55	squarelyrooted by population or size
GavinHJackson	718824498556989441	2016-04-09T15:34:50	Just for clarity (if needed), I don't do political endorsements but I am available for selfies with random strangers on request.
GavinHJackson	718862728463544324	2016-04-09T18:06:44	fr__nds man capitalism is amazing
GavinHJackson	718859392460976128	2016-04-09T17:53:29	???! 
GavinHJackson	718854230577180672	2016-04-09T17:32:58	aubored plus it probably makes it harder to represent both sides if one side will not talk to you, I don't cover politics though.
GavinHJackson	718853677688188928	2016-04-09T17:30:47	aubored I've not seen anyone say that but I guess the argument is that the public are owed a comment so he should answer questions.
GavinHJackson	718847355722850305	2016-04-09T17:05:39	aubored I think it is fine to wait outside a senior politicians house. I also think it is fine when people tell journalists to fuck off.
GavinHJackson	718835101937836032	2016-04-09T16:16:58	alexhawkes Pete_Spence yeah but stuff like setting up a holding company to avoid PAYE seems dishonest too
GavinHJackson	718834821083107328	2016-04-09T16:15:51	SMTuffy Pete_Spence it is just the particular Cameron case where there is a misperception
GavinHJackson	718834723544547328	2016-04-09T16:15:28	SMTuffy Pete_Spence the perception that there are offshore shell companies used by the rich and powerful to hide their money is correct
GavinHJackson	718833166224596992	2016-04-09T16:09:16	SMTuffy Pete_Spence I know,  but there is a perception of hypocrisy in some quarters.
GavinHJackson	718832445534117888	2016-04-09T16:06:24	alexhawkes Pete_Spence thanks. surely there are some legal arguments that people are likely to find dishonest as well?
GavinHJackson	718831452037758977	2016-04-09T16:02:28	SMTuffy Pete_Spence or to do something on an international basis. But these are all issues for wonks, lawyers and so on.
GavinHJackson	718829684709068801	2016-04-09T15:55:26	alexhawkes Pete_Spence I always thought it was avoidance plus illegality.
GavinHJackson	718829503846477824	2016-04-09T15:54:43	alexhawkes Pete_Spence evasion is avoidance with dishonesty?
GavinHJackson	718827951425523712	2016-04-09T15:48:33	Pete_Spence to demonstrate and register their anger through a protest which they hope'll provide an impetus for politicians to crack down
GavinHJackson	718827227471880192	2016-04-09T15:45:40	Pete_Spence offshore shell companies set up by the rich and powerful in tax havens
GavinHJackson	718826514649849856	2016-04-09T15:42:50	Pete_Spence doesn't take a genius to figure out what they're protesting about Pete.
GavinHJackson	718826135988080642	2016-04-09T15:41:20	Pete_Spence nah they're protesting the forms of tax avoidance they think are wrong
GavinHJackson	718825374642212864	2016-04-09T15:38:19	stephenkb yeah good point
GavinHJackson	718825204986863616	2016-04-09T15:37:38	Pete_Spence i think it is unlikely but if the law was changed then they would become evasion
GavinHJackson	718825062707654656	2016-04-09T15:37:04	Pete_Spence well yeah, once is illegal and one isn't
GavinHJackson	718824919535067136	2016-04-09T15:36:30	stephenkb (not the national living wage but the bedroom tax)
GavinHJackson	718824821333864452	2016-04-09T15:36:07	stephenkb fair but how do you feel about calling it the Bedroom Tax?
GavinHJackson	718824567846920193	2016-04-09T15:35:06	Pete_Spence what is it then? HMRC often retroactively declares avoidance schemes to be evasion.
GavinHJackson	718824284026716162	2016-04-09T15:33:59	Pete_Spence isn't the difference just that once is illegal and once isn't?
GavinHJackson	718819516940230656	2016-04-09T15:15:02	aubored is that the bit you object to? Waiting outside people's houses?
GavinHJackson	718818500865892352	2016-04-09T15:11:00	aubored nah. I might do it  outside a bank or a company's headquarters.
GavinHJackson	718818009356353536	2016-04-09T15:09:03	aubored though that means that you'll do stuff in the street because it's when people are going between two buildings.
GavinHJackson	718817758830575616	2016-04-09T15:08:03	aubored hanging round somewhere waiting for someone to come out so you can ask them a question is doorstepping. I assume that's what C4 did
GavinHJackson	718817249793060865	2016-04-09T15:06:01	aubored why? Both are doorsteps?
GavinHJackson	718813169381220352	2016-04-09T14:49:49	JoMicheII plus I think when there's a boom a lot of new ideas and innovations are created that would not otherwise.
GavinHJackson	718812989781123072	2016-04-09T14:49:06	JoMicheII if you believe in hysteresis

GavinHJackson	718812068305104897	2016-04-09T14:45:26	_andrew_griffin I think the problem is multiple meanings of interest. One definition is just that interest = stake in a company.
GavinHJackson	718811409484804096	2016-04-09T14:42:49	_andrew_griffin I would think of it as an interest. But that is a good point.
GavinHJackson	718810594351169537	2016-04-09T14:39:35	_andrew_griffin morally it may be. But factually it is an offshore interest.
GavinHJackson	718810184647319552	2016-04-09T14:37:57	aubored it might not be pensions. This stuff is more widespread than people know

GavinHJackson	718805208256626688	2016-04-09T14:18:11	aubored but if someone asked me that question I personally could not answer.
GavinHJackson	718805049716158464	2016-04-09T14:17:33	aubored most UK asset managers are based in Dublin and Luxembourg. A significant portion own funds based in places like the BVI
GavinHJackson	718804780848705538	2016-04-09T14:16:29	aubored not saying there's no difference. But a lot of people are likely to have unconsciously invested in offshore funds.

GavinHJackson	717994569992941568	2016-04-07T08:36:59	twlldun DuncanWeldon can also make you think that all politicians are equally indifferent.
GavinHJackson	717994205210140672	2016-04-07T08:35:32	Gilesyb DuncanWeldon the people who make that argument about trade are rarely the ones who suffer because of it üòú
GavinHJackson	717993876808671232	2016-04-07T08:34:14	Gilesyb DuncanWeldon I don't think they are! I'm just saying that for a given utility function all the behaviour makes sense.
GavinHJackson	717992724041973761	2016-04-07T08:29:39	twlldun DuncanWeldon well I was condensing it down to 140 characters

GavinHJackson	717855927832035328	2016-04-06T23:26:04	tristandross yeah that is sad.
GavinHJackson	717855564315930624	2016-04-06T23:24:38	tristandross that doesn't bother me tbh, just noise
GavinHJackson	717855245733380096	2016-04-06T23:23:22	tristandross this is ironic
GavinHJackson	717845741583077376	2016-04-06T22:45:36	DuncanWeldon yeah that is what I expected.
GavinHJackson	717844605866262532	2016-04-06T22:41:05	DuncanWeldon Should be, of the reasons I find this kind of argument silly one is that..
GavinHJackson	717844446222663681	2016-04-06T22:40:27	DuncanWeldon but in general I find this sort of argument silly because poorer people are less likely to vote in all sorts of elections.
GavinHJackson	717843766116294656	2016-04-06T22:37:45	DuncanWeldon right, well Bernie Sanders is winning among younger people, hispanics and lower income voters right now in the D primary.
GavinHJackson	717843129706135552	2016-04-06T22:35:13	DuncanWeldon Is there any evidence for this but anecdotes of posh trots?
GavinHJackson	717842482587942912	2016-04-06T22:32:39	DuncanWeldon And if you genuinely believe that Hilary is an imperialist and a capitalist lackey then you lose if she wins too.
GavinHJackson	717842160368885760	2016-04-06T22:31:22	DuncanWeldon okay, you slightly increase the probability of a marginal loss for a low probability of a higher gain. Seems rational to me.
GavinHJackson	717841627285471232	2016-04-06T22:29:15	DuncanWeldon status quo is intolerable then it makes sense to me to make a longshot bet. If there's no loss why not gamble?
GavinHJackson	717841387614511104	2016-04-06T22:28:18	DuncanWeldon well it's all about risk versus return. If you believe there is little difference between the two other candidates and the
GavinHJackson	717840270960799744	2016-04-06T22:23:52	DuncanWeldon okay but even if you do genuinely believe that he can't win, you can still understand the appeal? I get why people vote Green.
GavinHJackson	717839454510170113	2016-04-06T22:20:37	DuncanWeldon okay but that's conjecture and we've gone from 'not able to win' to 'more likely to lose'
GavinHJackson	717839104105426946	2016-04-06T22:19:13	DuncanWeldon okay. But even so I'm not sure he would lose against either Cruz or Trump and Hilary's favourables are only going one way.
GavinHJackson	717838902653034502	2016-04-06T22:18:25	DuncanWeldon Here is Trump v Sanders: Sanders has a clear lead 
GavinHJackson	717838743147778048	2016-04-06T22:17:47	DuncanWeldon even if you accept that some polls show him doing better than Hilary against Trump.

GavinHJackson	717023852522561536	2016-04-04T16:19:42	AbeLolisted sanderwagner yeah but how many white working class voters turnout to Republican primaries? Can't be that many.
GavinHJackson	717023639850393600	2016-04-04T16:18:52	AbeLolisted sanderwagner if the Dem base was as heavily white and male as it used to be Sanders would have won.

GavinHJackson	717021386213031936	2016-04-04T16:09:54	sanderwagner AbeLolisted but Trump is also generally more unpopular meaning that overall Sanders does better among low income voters.
GavinHJackson	717021115403661312	2016-04-04T16:08:50	sanderwagner AbeLolisted While Trump voters similarly have low incomes but are less likely to have gone to college and are older.
GavinHJackson	717020823278764032	2016-04-04T16:07:40	sanderwagner AbeLolisted Sanders does well among young college-educated whites who have low incomes but good prospects basically.

GavinHJackson	716729510213849088	2016-04-03T20:50:06	kadhimshubber yeah the annuity will be a claim on an insurance fund.
GavinHJackson	716729203975135232	2016-04-03T20:48:53	kadhimshubber though I guess the annuities themselves are just a claim on a fund.. or something?
GavinHJackson	716728565425971201	2016-04-03T20:46:20	kadhimshubber I don't know though. I should probably spend more time figuring out the pensions system.

GavinHJackson	715590139439919104	2016-03-31T17:22:38	TomHale_ conor_sullivan and surely it depends on where the value breaks in the event of a bankruptcy. Depositors/government are senior.
GavinHJackson	715589295487262720	2016-03-31T17:19:17	GavinHJackson conor_sullivan because when banks go under completely the government is on the hook anyway, via deposit guarantees
GavinHJackson	715586846970015744	2016-03-31T17:09:33	tomashirstecon I think argument is basically: bad things would've happened if banks failed, so saved them, why behavior different w steel?

GavinHJackson	715585762926919680	2016-03-31T17:05:15	kadhimshubber JoMicheII Gilesyb the government didn't pay for lending losses until there was a risk the payments system failed
GavinHJackson	715585046783127553	2016-03-31T17:02:24	SMDeeee I think that argument is very weak.
GavinHJackson	715584311177699328	2016-03-31T16:59:29	johnb78 dsquareddigest Yes I know that. That is obvious. But it is seven years after the crisis now and the government still owns RBS.
GavinHJackson	715584094877388801	2016-03-31T16:58:37	kadhimshubber JoMicheII Gilesyb key thing is that we can't separate payments from credit.
GavinHJackson	715583984462348289	2016-03-31T16:58:11	kadhimshubber JoMicheII Gilesyb right okay. That is all clear. So why are regulators doing all this new regulatory capital stuff if the
GavinHJackson	715583504147472384	2016-03-31T16:56:16	dsquareddigest johnb78 so it is my original point: that UK steel isn't a going concern but banks are?
GavinHJackson	715583109144702976	2016-03-31T16:54:42	dsquareddigest johnb78 well Tata would be solvent after a government bailout as well.
GavinHJackson	715582346704064512	2016-03-31T16:51:40	kadhimshubber JoMicheII Gilesyb this that realtime matching versus end-of-day settlement thing you were talking about?
GavinHJackson	715581796960899072	2016-03-31T16:49:29	johnb78 dsquareddigest same as in any bankruptcy.
GavinHJackson	715581451371159552	2016-03-31T16:48:07	Gilesyb JoMicheII kadhimshubber MissEllieMae it's that old thing that the software our banking system runs on is just really bad?
GavinHJackson	715581145329569792	2016-03-31T16:46:54	johnb78 dsquareddigest well you'd just do exactly what the government did but then wind the banks down afterwards instead.
GavinHJackson	715579938682839041	2016-03-31T16:42:06	Birdyword kadhimshubber JoMicheII MissEllieMae dlknowles that one is more persuasive imo.
GavinHJackson	715579643819114496	2016-03-31T16:40:56	MissEllieMae kadhimshubber JoMicheII maybe this is why people don't trust this argument from the left?
GavinHJackson	715578952237072385	2016-03-31T16:38:11	dsquareddigest johnb78 I believe the government could have protected the payments system while allowing other parts to fail. Am I wrong?
GavinHJackson	715578337297637376	2016-03-31T16:35:45	kadhimshubber JoMicheII MissEllieMae no people always say "money wouldn't have come out of the ATMs, people wouldn't have been paid"
GavinHJackson	715578119768391681	2016-03-31T16:34:53	I think this is the difference: more jobs were at risk than just bankers. 
GavinHJackson	715577871285297152	2016-03-31T16:33:53	JoMicheII kadhimshubber MissEllieMae but they could have wound them down after the acute phase of the crisis was over.
GavinHJackson	715577464496463872	2016-03-31T16:32:16	kadhimshubber JoMicheII MissEllieMae I know that! But the argument people make is always based on payments.
GavinHJackson	715577347634814976	2016-03-31T16:31:49	kadhimshubber the argument there (that I think the FT editorial board made) is that it was a one off capital injection while this isn't.
GavinHJackson	715577149953060865	2016-03-31T16:31:01	JoMicheII MissEllieMae but theoretically you could have protected the payment system and wound down the banks or something?
GavinHJackson	715576973834252290	2016-03-31T16:30:19	though the banking system won't be a going concern if the regulators have their way, amirite fellas? Try the veal. How about that liquidity?

GavinHJackson	710771802566488064	2016-03-18T10:16:17	alanbeattie robfordmancs JeyyLowe well in plenty of places in this country anyone with the right rosette will get elected.
GavinHJackson	710770607076589568	2016-03-18T10:11:32	robfordmancs JeyyLowe well so does people always singling her out for criticism!
GavinHJackson	710770071044497409	2016-03-18T10:09:25	alanbeattie robfordmancs JeyyLowe MPs are party delegates though. That is how everyone thinks of them.
GavinHJackson	710769955525029888	2016-03-18T10:08:57	robfordmancs JeyyLowe okay, well she's my local MP and I would prefer a different candidate. I think that's completely democratic.
GavinHJackson	710769218917154816	2016-03-18T10:06:01	robfordmancs JeyyLowe And organising to remove an MP is how democracy is meant to work.
GavinHJackson	710769037584830465	2016-03-18T10:05:18	robfordmancs JeyyLowe if we're talking about people getting help.
GavinHJackson	710768985483173889	2016-03-18T10:05:06	robfordmancs JeyyLowe surely the point of criticising an MP is so that they lose their job at the next election?
GavinHJackson	710768869040902144	2016-03-18T10:04:38	robfordmancs JeyyLowe but that seems insignificant in the face of local authority cuts.

GavinHJackson	710767473772068864	2016-03-18T09:59:05	JeyyLowe robfordmancs this is all very focused on perception. I still do not understand what the problem is with deslection

GavinHJackson	710389645603938304	2016-03-17T08:57:44	All praise to s8mb for attacking this ill thought out bung to SMEs  
GavinHJackson	710400880059785216	2016-03-17T09:42:23	Buy it! 
GavinHJackson	710398750477393920	2016-03-17T09:33:55	Zettel314 possible that the sugar tax is actually the most politically damaging part of the budget
GavinHJackson	710398090008727552	2016-03-17T09:31:17	Zettel314 Even "there's going to have to be more cuts to hit his target" helps him politically.
GavinHJackson	710397692405485568	2016-03-17T09:29:43	Zettel314 ...would that really harm him? Could paint his opponents as enemies of business/on side of welfare claimants.
GavinHJackson	710397571726856194	2016-03-17T09:29:14	Zettel314 if people weren't talking about the sugar tax, but where instead talking about cuts to disability benefit and corporation tax...
GavinHJackson	710397416135118848	2016-03-17T09:28:37	AbiWilks kadhimshubber _andrew_griffin probably better to tax bad things like sugar instead of good things like corporations though.
GavinHJackson	710396255877373952	2016-03-17T09:24:00	Instead of bashing Osborne for not meeting his targets, prob should have bashed him for setting them in the first place.  r4today
GavinHJackson	710394850533904384	2016-03-17T09:18:25	_andrew_griffin kadhimshubber there was a lot of stuff in there. Lifetime ISAs are more interesting than the deficit.
GavinHJackson	710394748142534656	2016-03-17T09:18:01	AbiWilks kadhimshubber _andrew_griffin don't follow.
GavinHJackson	710393715773349888	2016-03-17T09:13:54	AbiWilks kadhimshubber _andrew_griffin tobacco duty is a regressive tax, I like that too.
GavinHJackson	710393534495514624	2016-03-17T09:13:11	Another little nugget of wisdom from Martin Wolf  
GavinHJackson	710393266336899072	2016-03-17T09:12:07	kadhimshubber _andrew_griffin is it? Seems like a pretty sensible idea to me.
GavinHJackson	710393150116929536	2016-03-17T09:11:40	_andrew_griffin kadhimshubber yeah that's what I'm saying. But they always were going to. Most people just tune out economic stuff.
GavinHJackson	710392851822223361	2016-03-17T09:10:28	kadhimshubber _andrew_griffin I mean, they ought to be, but they're not really; e.g. Osborne has consistently missed targets.
GavinHJackson	710392670280146945	2016-03-17T09:09:45	kadhimshubber _andrew_griffin yeah but in a really postmodern way where it is all about PR, the actual facts aren't really important.
GavinHJackson	710392205417037824	2016-03-17T09:07:54	Ned_Donovan kadhimshubber _andrew_griffin a medium of exchange
GavinHJackson	710391914751762432	2016-03-17T09:06:45	kadhimshubber _andrew_griffin And don't think anyone ever cared about the deficit that much. People always got it confused with the debt
GavinHJackson	710391808874954752	2016-03-17T09:06:20	kadhimshubber _andrew_griffin right fine, but I think the sugar tax is probably more important than deficit forecasts anyway.
GavinHJackson	710391259559501824	2016-03-17T09:04:09	kadhimshubber _andrew_griffin Has the deficit ever been on the front page of the sun?
GavinHJackson	710390409512488960	2016-03-17T09:00:46	_andrew_griffin Yeah but I imagine the people who care about deficit forecasts will still care about them.
GavinHJackson	710389950743715840	2016-03-17T08:58:57	_andrew_griffin well I imagine all of the budget is thought through in terms of a media strategy
GavinHJackson	710389705301479424	2016-03-17T08:57:58	_andrew_griffin What is a media strategy? Taxing sugar?
