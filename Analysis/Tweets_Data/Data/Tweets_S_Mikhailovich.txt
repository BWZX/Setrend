S_Mikhailovich	685231315638218752	2016-01-07T22:47:31	VictorCleaner captain_credit We agree on GLD. I expect supply disruptions &amp; ultimate cash settlement under force majeure. Same for Comex
S_Mikhailovich	685230101445918720	2016-01-07T22:42:41	VictorCleaner captain_credit Yes, thats exactly what I meant. Once they can't allocate, GLD doesn't work
S_Mikhailovich	685229722394062848	2016-01-07T22:41:11	VictorCleaner captain_credit The point is simple - market thinks gold ETFs r backed by gold. If gold is not readily available- a problem
S_Mikhailovich	685229304041586689	2016-01-07T22:39:31	VictorCleaner captain_credit Don't APs have a window within which to allocate?
S_Mikhailovich	685227617008619521	2016-01-07T22:32:49	VictorCleaner captain_credit How so?
S_Mikhailovich	685226359782772737	2016-01-07T22:27:49	TheVolawatcher I think this negative correlation is situational. I can see cases where both $ &amp; gold rise with gold outperforming the $.
S_Mikhailovich	685215964166754304	2016-01-07T21:46:31	captain_credit VictorCleaner Agree - gold sold by GLD not coming back &amp; remaining deliverable bars won't be enough to meet rise in demand
S_Mikhailovich	685213883326443521	2016-01-07T21:38:15	captain_credit VictorCleaner Its a supply &amp; demand issue. If more people ever decide to allocate to gold &amp; use ETFs, ETFs must buy bullion
S_Mikhailovich	685197965158420481	2016-01-07T20:34:59	As investors sold gold ETFs, ETFs sold bars &amp; they went to Asia. As gold ETF demand returns, ETFs need to buy those bars back. squeeze

S_Mikhailovich	684430585205551108	2016-01-05T17:45:42	Investors take gold availability for granted but deliverable stock of bars &amp; coins is limited. Same true for refining &amp; minting capacities.
