2ndadopter	697163000310923264	2016-02-09T20:59:46	But I try to think about edge as much as a can.

2ndadopter	697162208279601154	2016-02-09T20:56:37	But for both behavior and time horizon to be a source of edge, you need something else, which is very important.
2ndadopter	697162098757906432	2016-02-09T20:56:11	Time horizon quoted as a source of edge could also just be an excuse for having something go against you.
2ndadopter	697161996949520384	2016-02-09T20:55:47	Behavior and time horizon can be inter-related.
2ndadopter	697161236094406656	2016-02-09T20:52:45	Time horizon fits in here as well, which was another big vote getter.

2ndadopter	697160619108139008	2016-02-09T20:50:18	Problem I see here is folks behavior with their PA and then within the fund. Capital flight risk can completely neutralize behavior.
2ndadopter	697160394004037632	2016-02-09T20:49:25	Now on to behavior, which I definitely think CAN be an edge.
2ndadopter	697160183974203392	2016-02-09T20:48:35	But I'd imagine that idiots balance out the smart folks pretty well, and neutralize the analysis edge.

2ndadopter	697159978944102400	2016-02-09T20:47:46	Issue here is that models, etc. are only as good as the inputs.
2ndadopter	697159902851047424	2016-02-09T20:47:28	I personally don't think that analysis is an edge whatsoever. I know plenty of folks that can build a three statement model blindfolded.

2ndadopter	697159376373575682	2016-02-09T20:45:22	Problem is, an information edge is tough to come by, especially these days, and without bending the rules.
2ndadopter	697159258740142082	2016-02-09T20:44:54	If you have better information than someone else, all things equal, that's a huge edge.

2ndadopter	697159133301084160	2016-02-09T20:44:24	But sticking with these options, in my view, the "best" source of investment edge is clearly information.
2ndadopter	697159004842164224	2016-02-09T20:43:53	Also in fairness, they're all somewhat related. One can impact the other(s).

2ndadopter	697158619524018176	2016-02-09T20:42:22	In fairness, there are other sources of edge that aren't listed. Size for instance. Or deal flow.
2ndadopter	697158438791438336	2016-02-09T20:41:39	The clear winner in this poll was "behavioral" with 44% of the votes.
