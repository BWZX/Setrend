JWGOP	724436788585074688	2016-04-25T03:16:04	Statement from NeverTrumpPAC on Cruz/Kasich news: 
JWGOP	724433672821157888	2016-04-25T03:03:41	Very impressed that Cruz has finally put aside his pride to realize he can't stop Trump alone. This alliance is a necessity. Kasich Cruz
JWGOP	724442668852490240	2016-04-25T03:39:26	Bottom line: If johnkasich voters follow the direction of their candidate, tedcruz wins Indiana and openconvention guaranteed.
JWGOP	724444627915419649	2016-04-25T03:47:13	If the tedcruz - johnkasich alliance is such bad news for them, why are the realDonaldTrump supporters so angry online?

JWGOP	724437012330209280	2016-04-25T03:16:57	Which is why this a great deal for Kasich. Cruz gets them while bound, Kasich gets them on later votes.

JWGOP	724420215690432517	2016-04-25T02:10:13	Ceding New Mexico is a big deal for Cruz: In post-March 15 memo, Cruz camp wrote they were on pace to "win a majority of delegates" there.
JWGOP	724417480488325126	2016-04-25T01:59:21	The OR/NM for IN deal is just smart business. OR/NM are proportional &amp; allows JK to pick up delegates. IN is WTA &amp; Cruz stronger there.
JWGOP	724419531632824320	2016-04-25T02:07:30	Yep. And worth it just to hear realDonaldTrump do that Ned Beatty in "Deliverance" imitation he's perfecting.
