Charles_Lister	702854501095624705	2016-02-25T13:55:46	GissiSim That, I’m afraid, is utter fantasy at this pt. More nuanced strategy needed, based on actual understanding of groups, not YouTube.
Charles_Lister	702853863267831808	2016-02-25T13:53:14	GissiSim So let’s give up on them &amp; let AQ et al. eventually enjoy 10,000s new disenfranchised &amp; angry recruits? Is that really a solution?
Charles_Lister	702853256616255488	2016-02-25T13:50:49	GissiSim Distrust &amp; paranoia has emerged out of the US driving an increasing imbalance. Adding to that will only escalate things further.
Charles_Lister	702852909726343169	2016-02-25T13:49:26	GissiSim Arming YPG at expense of genuinely moderate factions is not going to build bridges, I assure you. Dialogue &amp; mediation = solution.
Charles_Lister	702852379553701888	2016-02-25T13:47:20	GissiSim This has nothing *at all* to do with racism to Kurds. It's a political issue, dominated by distrust &amp; paranoia. Must bridge this.
Charles_Lister	702852016356327424	2016-02-25T13:45:53	GissiSim Again, another massive simplification. Most major Aleppo factions have Kurds in their senior leadership. Distrust of PYD is issue.
Charles_Lister	702851460732682242	2016-02-25T13:43:41	GissiSim Adapt, yes. But one cannot simply ignore simple facts for the sake of appeasing Russia. That’s not a solution, it’s just naivety.
Charles_Lister	702851056640925696	2016-02-25T13:42:04	GissiSim Throwing all one's cards in with a faction/s that have little/no influence elsewhere &amp; are widely hated is no way to solve Syria.
Charles_Lister	702850673080197120	2016-02-25T13:40:33	GissiSim So long as people adopt such black/white dichotomies [opposition way more complex than that] only divisive policies will continue.
Charles_Lister	702848349339254785	2016-02-25T13:31:19	PT: YPG has much sway in Kurdish territory, but dominant Arab actor Jaish al-Thuwar widely detested by 100,000+ opposition. Hardly unifying.
