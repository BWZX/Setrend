modern_rock	712691786641121284	2016-03-23T17:25:37	KillianFoley but shorting day 1 crazies is a risky business. Without proper risk management you can blow up. So avoid or go tiny if u must

modern_rock	692871501528244224	2016-01-29T00:46:53	Starting a trade w/smaller size makes it easier to accept taking the loss when wrong. And when ur plan is working, u can then ADD TO WINNER!
modern_rock	692865358324060160	2016-01-29T00:22:28	Trading with smaller size can actually make u more money: ur not stressed out from the $ swing &amp; u can hold longer for the stock to play out
modern_rock	692855077875245057	2016-01-28T23:41:37	2. Trade small early! No matter how much you think you know, you'll likely blow an account or two. Keep it small, learn from mistakes
modern_rock	692863131731668992	2016-01-29T00:13:38	but when starting out trying to grow an acct, ur 100% correct: focus on what u can consistently profit &amp; avoid rest! 
modern_rock	692862342246174720	2016-01-29T00:10:29	no one likes discomfort. but in order to grow, u must go outside your comfort zone. Muscles grow stronger only when stress is put on them!
modern_rock	692861398515200000	2016-01-29T00:06:44	the only way to know is to do it. so trade. win or lose, learn from it. then go &amp; see what works &amp; do it again. And eliminate what dont work
modern_rock	692860945190629377	2016-01-29T00:04:56	but the key when starting is not to try to learn everything b/c thats IMPOSSIBLE. So focus on what u have been successful &amp; try to master it
modern_rock	692860679645040641	2016-01-29T00:03:53	what i realize is that what you think is your niche, actually changes over time as u develop new/different skills. so never stop learning!
modern_rock	692860306150727681	2016-01-29T00:02:24	But the key is to first find a REPEATABLE &amp; CONSISTENT strategy to start off. This will give u the luxury to look to expand ur playbook

modern_rock	692859753056186371	2016-01-29T00:00:12	Your niche will be your bread &amp; butter where ur very comfy to profit consistently. but never stop trying to expand, possibly multiple niches
modern_rock	692858965281996800	2016-01-28T23:57:04	never be too comfortable with just your small niche, as u should look for opportunities to expand your playbook
