hunterw	722868089533153280	2016-04-20T19:22:37	ShaunKing and, yes, your explanation is possible even if I find it fishy
hunterw	722868000106397696	2016-04-20T19:22:16	ShaunKing I was sickened by the whole questioning your life story thing
hunterw	722867940752797696	2016-04-20T19:22:01	ShaunKing either way, I like a lot of your work and some of the attacks against you have been awful
hunterw	722867840118861824	2016-04-20T19:21:37	ShaunKing KailiJoy but also that you noticed and rolled with it
hunterw	722867762939432960	2016-04-20T19:21:19	ShaunKing KailiJoy knowing tabloids and aggregation it's very plausible to me an editor was engaged in bad practices there
hunterw	722867170884104194	2016-04-20T19:18:58	Mobute rachelzarrell KailiJoy I think he has some responsibility for what was published even if his editors were the ones that did this
hunterw	722866941883518976	2016-04-20T19:18:03	Mobute rachelzarrell KailiJoy see here- there are degrees 
hunterw	722866760337244160	2016-04-20T19:17:20	.LucyStag and you're the one bringing up Glass. There are obviously degrees of fuck ups along these lines. His would not be the worst
hunterw	722866401149644800	2016-04-20T19:15:54	ShaunKing KailiJoy or maybe what you've said is true. I don't know but one is far more plausible to me
hunterw	722866275702153217	2016-04-20T19:15:24	ShaunKing KailiJoy my theory would be that this was a practice at the daily news that you were complicit in
hunterw	722866075373858816	2016-04-20T19:14:37	ShaunKing KailiJoy right but you're saying you never look online. I find that highly suspect
hunterw	722865850966007808	2016-04-20T19:13:43	.LucyStag if you see below I said it could have been an accident but it's questionable to me that it was on multiple occasions
hunterw	722865573558939648	2016-04-20T19:12:37	deep_beige was that one time or the time you had to post that hilarious correction? Hard to remember
hunterw	722865492042629120	2016-04-20T19:12:18	deep_beige you've been butt hurt for years now about one time I mocked you
hunterw	722865316771049472	2016-04-20T19:11:36	LucyStag that's pretty silly. We have basically two obligations tell the truth and don't rip people off
hunterw	722864879019954177	2016-04-20T19:09:51	And yes, it's also true some of the folks gleefully going after him attacked cause he's liberal
hunterw	722864691341574144	2016-04-20T19:09:07	And I'm pretty certain some of the same people defending Shaun King right now would be eating him alive if he was a conservative.
hunterw	722864526169923584	2016-04-20T19:08:27	deep_beige rachelzarrell Mobute KailiJoy enjoy splitting hairs Brendan
hunterw	722864102205472768	2016-04-20T19:06:46	rachelzarrell deep_beige Mobute KailiJoy not really! He didn't notice that he plagiarized is basically the excuse here
hunterw	722863930029252608	2016-04-20T19:06:05	Mobute KailiJoy this happened so many times. Hard to buy an intelligent person never looked or noticed
hunterw	722863778287730689	2016-04-20T19:05:29	deep_beige Mobute KailiJoy even if the changes were initiated elsewhere he was complicit in not noticing
hunterw	722863587157479424	2016-04-20T19:04:43	deep_beige Mobute KailiJoy that's meaningless to me
hunterw	722863513220329472	2016-04-20T19:04:26	Mobute KailiJoy you're ignoring my point here
hunterw	722863319552495616	2016-04-20T19:03:40	.Mobute KailiJoy -- ShaunKing is like on the razor's edge of plausibility
hunterw	722863131794534400	2016-04-20T19:02:55	Mobute KailiJoy totally. But there's several pieces here -- and a block quote is something that is very easily seen
hunterw	722862967054856192	2016-04-20T19:02:16	.KailiJoy and the story promotion mode line is bunk. Part of promotion and engaging involves looking at article shares and comments on site
hunterw	722862753044688896	2016-04-20T19:01:25	.KailiJoy but this happened multiple times and I find it very hard to believe ShaunKing never looked at his stuff online
hunterw	722862627169415168	2016-04-20T19:00:55	.KailiJoy well I don't always look at every story again and when I do sometimes I miss stuff cause it's harder reading something 100th time
hunterw	722861480249528320	2016-04-20T18:56:21	A little nuance would be nice. Vindicated seems like a stretch for such a barely passable explanation of things
hunterw	722861325941096448	2016-04-20T18:55:44	Anyway, I guess the Slate take machine needed to be counterintuitive and ideological sites stretched to defend Shaun
hunterw	722861102409916416	2016-04-20T18:54:51	Kings story is possible! But really strains credulity. It's also at odds with his initial response.
hunterw	722860894821228544	2016-04-20T18:54:02	Even if an editor was the one who stripped quotes out of multiple stories, I find it hard to believe ShaunKing never glanced at his work
hunterw	722860618412331008	2016-04-20T18:52:56	This is a silly take. ShaunKing has not been vindicated his explanation is just barely plausible

hunterw	710925753722998785	2016-03-18T20:28:02	Anyone who thinks reporters were like turning down Jeb, Rand, and Rubio interviews to cover Trump is delusional.

hunterw	710925335425105921	2016-03-18T20:26:22	I know other reporters who had similar experiences. Earlier in the campaign I absolutely preferred interviews and insights from other camps.
hunterw	710925066633089024	2016-03-18T20:25:18	I personally experienced being able to communicate with Trump when others would not respond. Being communicative makes stories.
hunterw	710924808033329153	2016-03-18T20:24:17	But, as I pointed out, before Trump pulled ahead, he was more accessible to media than others. They had opportunities and didn't take them
hunterw	710924650814033920	2016-03-18T20:23:39	First off, leading candidates **should** get disproportionate coverage relative to those behind them. That's part of the winnowing process.

hunterw	710922573329129472	2016-03-18T20:15:24	This is a country where 15-20% of people at a minimum really like the vibe that Donald Trump is putting down.
hunterw	710921133995008000	2016-03-18T20:09:41	And a good number of people don't care about the criticism Trump has gotten from the media and political establishment. Deal with it.
hunterw	710921014855786496	2016-03-18T20:09:12	Also, let's be real. Media has been highly critical of Trump. Going through his biz record, exposing lies, past scandals, holes in policy.
hunterw	710920810920288256	2016-03-18T20:08:24	Before Trump built a lead he was one of many who merited coverage through standing in the polls.
hunterw	710920639880814597	2016-03-18T20:07:43	Most candidates are not as accessible to media as Trump was in the beginning. That was a smart move on his part. It got exposure.
hunterw	710919931676725248	2016-03-18T20:04:54	I remember thinking it was funny when Rand Paul would whine about time he was getting. His people weren't responsive to press like Trump was
hunterw	710919765896859648	2016-03-18T20:04:15	Trump has had a strategy of relying on heavy media attention from the beginning. Other candidates could have done this and cut into him.
hunterw	710919140014497793	2016-03-18T20:01:45	A lot of people in this country have reacted well to Trump's campaign. It's just true. Some people need to get over their denial about that.
hunterw	710918800594636800	2016-03-18T20:00:24	Does anyone actually think the press shouldn't cover a candidate who is doing well in polls and has a base? That's monstrously stupid.

hunterw	704710156463030273	2016-03-01T16:49:28	The anonymous online Trump army is racist, anti-semitic, vile, and despicable. The actual Trump supporters I've met are nothing like that.
hunterw	704696833763889152	2016-03-01T15:56:32	Wow, Tidal has confirmed that it fired its CFO and COO 
hunterw	704698644612706304	2016-03-01T16:03:44	dr7854 I think you're required to cut in for every major candidate. Can cut away and don't have to air in full
hunterw	704680726189510656	2016-03-01T14:52:32	From what I've heard from both camps, March 15 is indeed D Day in the Democratic primary.
hunterw	704680255173365760	2016-03-01T14:50:39	An awesome story about how Bernie built his campaign 
hunterw	704675636930023424	2016-03-01T14:32:18	A really fantastic story about Neo Nazi white supremacist Trump Twitter trolls and one of their favorite sites 
hunterw	704672543999832065	2016-03-01T14:20:01	Bernie Sanders just earned his first Super Tuesday win — in New Zealand:  
hunterw	704672627508453376	2016-03-01T14:20:21	$2.2m of the $17m Trump has spent on his own campaign has gone to pay Trump-owned businesses. 
hunterw	704670200424222720	2016-03-01T14:10:42	Bernie pool report from Yamiche 
hunterw	704519337705656320	2016-03-01T04:11:14	MayaTPrabhu I'm sorry you had to see that Maya. I'm usually sort of nicer
hunterw	704517987148144640	2016-03-01T04:05:52	On a totally separate note, whatever Trump did or did not say the NYT's handling of the off record interview was clearly bad and unethical
hunterw	704517543931846657	2016-03-01T04:04:06	In conclusion, ByronYork is an imbecile who should look up the term "ether" on Urban Dictionary.
hunterw	704517392244862981	2016-03-01T04:03:30	Gosh, I have been wanting to get this off my chest for a while. Glad I had a news peg of sorts.
hunterw	704517290289700865	2016-03-01T04:03:05	So, ByronYork's story about how "crazy" that all was aged worse than raw fish.
hunterw	704517179451035648	2016-03-01T04:02:39	Trump subsequently specifically addressed databases and later like quadrupled down with the ban.
hunterw	704517066510958592	2016-03-01T04:02:12	When the follow up occurred ByronYork's dumb hackery was even more blatant.
hunterw	704516888097898499	2016-03-01T04:01:30	Like, yes, ByronYork he didn't address it, which is **not ruling it out** and merits follow up
hunterw	704516672821043200	2016-03-01T04:00:38	It's clearly legit to present that as him not ruling something out. ByronYork did some bizarre defensive contortion to say it's not
hunterw	704516468336156672	2016-03-01T03:59:49	Anyway, Trump was clearly presented with a draconian idea, didn't agree specifically, said we would have to do a lot of unprecedented stuff
hunterw	704516107915436033	2016-03-01T03:58:24	Everyone caught on to database thing but no one talked about how Trump didn't rule out special IDs for Muslims, but that's another story
hunterw	704515777362325504	2016-03-01T03:57:05	That's blatantly untrue. Trump clearly answered the question. He did not rule out the *two* ideas I presented.
hunterw	704515529906790401	2016-03-01T03:56:06	The point, if you can call it that, that ByronYork tried to make is that Trump simply "didn't address" my suggestion about Muslim database
hunterw	704515271235604480	2016-03-01T03:55:04	So in this column ByronYork puts a word salad around transcribed audio from my interview with Trump
hunterw	704514746750521346	2016-03-01T03:52:59	I first became acquainted with ByronYork when he wrote this column that's blatantly stupid, especially in hindsight 
hunterw	704514039351779328	2016-03-01T03:50:10	So, yeah, ByronYork's latest is clearly hot garbage. But when did I first notice his work you ask?
hunterw	704513909076725765	2016-03-01T03:49:39	Trump merely implied there could be some wiggle room in his platform, which pretty much is a given with any president.
hunterw	704513666436177920	2016-03-01T03:48:41	And despite ByronYork pushing Trump to say what he allegedly did to NYT, Trump didn't really back down much at all.
hunterw	704513263359369216	2016-03-01T03:47:05	BuzzFeedAndrew Andrew I'm just getting to that one. Don't fuck with my flow I'm having fun here.
hunterw	704513081708257280	2016-03-01T03:46:22	It's sad really. ByronYork is like self appointed unauthorized flack for Trump. He's not even in Trump's inner circle. Also not good at it
hunterw	704512862379757568	2016-03-01T03:45:30	It's like he was flacking for Trump. Trying to make him seem reasonable.
hunterw	704512721530834944	2016-03-01T03:44:56	I also love how if you read ByronYork's own story, he was so clearly fishing to have Trump say it was just a negotiating tactic
hunterw	704512515917668353	2016-03-01T03:44:07	Trump saying one thing to ByronYork does not have anything to do with an entirely different conversation we haven't seen. This is obvious
hunterw	704512288628350976	2016-03-01T03:43:13	This is so very, very stupid and disingenuous ByronYork
hunterw	704512192780099584	2016-03-01T03:42:50	He suggests the fact he asked a question and got Trump to suggest his rhetoric might be negotiating tactic proves the Buzzfeed story invalid
hunterw	704511926840254464	2016-03-01T03:41:47	Yet Byron doesn't just present this as an interesting thing to note in light of the BuzzFeedBen story.
hunterw	704511645972824064	2016-03-01T03:40:40	So, premise of this is interesting and valid. He once asked Trump about some of his proposals and Trump suggested they could be softened
hunterw	704511330452180992	2016-03-01T03:39:25	We'll start with the latest hack work by ByronYork - 
hunterw	704510779714891777	2016-03-01T03:37:13	Let's examine some of this shall we ByronYork?
hunterw	704510217279692800	2016-03-01T03:34:59	I wonder why ByronYork feels compelled to play defense for Trump. Have seen it twice now.
hunterw	704509097744461824	2016-03-01T03:30:32	blakehounshell I was thinking about this the other day. It would be profoundly weird
hunterw	704504420340473856	2016-03-01T03:11:57	But I will say Donald Trump certainly doesn't have long fingers.
hunterw	704504325024911361	2016-03-01T03:11:34	I have somewhat large hands. I don't think this necessarily a definitive answer.
hunterw	704503748534648832	2016-03-01T03:09:17	Donald Trump's fingers were definitely far shorter than mine and he is much taller than I am.
hunterw	704503565591683073	2016-03-01T03:08:33	I shot some footage of Trump's fingers. You can see how close I was. 
hunterw	704502838999838720	2016-03-01T03:05:40	At the last New Hampshire debate, I got close to Trump and took special care to observe his fingers.
hunterw	704502654089748481	2016-03-01T03:04:56	I guess I should address Trump's fingers since they have become a campaign issue.

hunterw	695763631619883008	2016-02-06T00:19:11	.ASDem Perhaps simply declaring a "win" or "loss" is not the best way to describe this. I think the night was. better for him than her
hunterw	695761380801126400	2016-02-06T00:10:14	ASDem I'd be interested to see both where things were at pre and post alignment. We get neither. It's a ridiculous process
hunterw	695761234881355777	2016-02-06T00:09:39	ASDem yeah I think you're right on his total just couldn't resist a joke
hunterw	695761098763595776	2016-02-06T00:09:07	.dznyc the primary system needs to be reformed and caucuses must be done away with. It should be 1 person 1 vote. Simple.
hunterw	695759755437088768	2016-02-06T00:03:46	.DanSWright I stood in a chaotic precinct with one of the Register's lead writers. It was crazy
hunterw	695759574800994304	2016-02-06T00:03:03	InspectorSailor DMRegister I've read it! A great piece
hunterw	695759219006558208	2016-02-06T00:01:39	Bottom line is, just cause Bernie's people have been clumsy in raising issues re: DNC and caucuses doesn't mean there aren't valid gripes
hunterw	695759000139395072	2016-02-06T00:00:46	dznyc Maybe! This process is so very silly and should be changed
hunterw	695758633154584576	2016-02-05T23:59:19	ASDem I would be into seeing both. Really I just wish caucuses were not used anywhere. It's so silly
hunterw	695758445488828416	2016-02-05T23:58:34	It's a tough balance to strike, how do you point to real issues without seeming whiny or paranoid. Not sure I know an answer
hunterw	695758287095074816	2016-02-05T23:57:56	However, they haven't really managed to make the legit points about this stuff and instead overreached and veered towards conspiracy theory
hunterw	695757933557243904	2016-02-05T23:56:32	Here's the thing, I think Bernie's camp has very legitimate reasons to raise questions about the DNC and caucus results.
hunterw	695757752992399361	2016-02-05T23:55:49	ASDem if he got them he got them though. Also I would not use the words O'Malley and "a lot" together in any discussion of voting
hunterw	695757495508185088	2016-02-05T23:54:48	So, yeah, it's not really crazy to say Bernie won Iowa. It went better for him than for Clinton and he likely got more votes.
hunterw	695757253786398720	2016-02-05T23:53:50	cyclingreporter not really! See above
hunterw	695757159250919424	2016-02-05T23:53:27	Also, I do believe Bernie probably got more votes based on the fact young and new voters would be undercounted.
hunterw	695756701832736777	2016-02-05T23:51:38	Too beat expectations and really get better momentum while basically tying in delegates is huge.
hunterw	695756547956334592	2016-02-05T23:51:02	Firstly, he vastly exceeded expectations. He also did far better than the Clinton people with their vaunted data operation predicted.

hunterw	694330622118998021	2016-02-02T01:24:55	Martin O'Malley showed up here at precinct at Drake. Said he will "make every college an option for every family." 
hunterw	694327827164835840	2016-02-02T01:13:48	They are temporarily sending media and observers out of this precinct because they need the space. I am being sent to the lobby.
hunterw	694327712865849345	2016-02-02T01:13:21	The temporary precinct chair is speaking now. Still a lot of folks outside.
hunterw	694327154335621121	2016-02-02T01:11:08	Decent O'Malley chant just started up. He might be beating Hillary on the applause-o-meter too.
hunterw	694326987272253440	2016-02-02T01:10:28	Based on chanting this is a Bernie precinct. Hillary chants were overwhelmed.
hunterw	694326061425778688	2016-02-02T01:06:47	So basically, the Drake college precinct is almost overwhelmed by turnout. And yet, it will still award a predetermined number of delegates.
hunterw	694324286287273984	2016-02-02T00:59:44	Overheard at this overcrowded precinct. "I don't know how they're going to pull this off." "Did they think this through?"
hunterw	694323499012214784	2016-02-02T00:56:36	This room is overflowing. Not sure how they will accommodate people. Many are still lining up to come in.

hunterw	694318616632651776	2016-02-02T00:37:12	This is the form for reporting caucus results. I am at Democratic precinct 38 in Des Moines, it will award five delegates.
hunterw	694316921248882688	2016-02-02T00:30:28	Outside saw people stuck at jobs who are probably disenfranchised. Overheard two girls talking about classmates who can't vote cause of work
