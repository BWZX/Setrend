emptywheel	721387819755823104	2016-04-16T17:20:33	ThePlumLineGS Thank you Hillary press release. Also thanks for pretending that my criticism of your linguistic games is partisanship.
emptywheel	721387510325243905	2016-04-16T17:19:19	ThePlumLineGS Again, I think Goldman speech $ are, as Hillary has said, given to all outgoing SOSes, not to potential future POTUSes

emptywheel	721386793044733954	2016-04-16T17:16:28	ThePlumLineGS No. I think you're making that up, and in so doing shutting down a lot of what you know abt what "favor" means.
emptywheel	721386595916595200	2016-04-16T17:15:41	ThePlumLineGS So I apologize for saying your post was bad journalism. It was just bad analysis.
emptywheel	721386459022893056	2016-04-16T17:15:09	ThePlumLineGS Neither of those little linguistic moves are supported by evidence. They're where you invent QPQ out of whole cloth.
emptywheel	721386299236753412	2016-04-16T17:14:31	ThePlumLineGS Ok, it was here you were mangling the quote, but that's clearly what you read to get to your "as if" = "explicit."
emptywheel	721382956581928960	2016-04-16T17:01:14	ThePlumLineGS So this is not abt "balance" tho suggestion is cute. It's abt your misquotation to support claims that aren't supported.
emptywheel	721382689736146944	2016-04-16T17:00:10	ThePlumLineGS It is considered bad journalism to selectively edit quotes to support an interpretation that'd be unsustainable otherwise.
emptywheel	721368463021883392	2016-04-16T16:03:38	ThePlumLineGS Again, with the purposeful mangling of quotes, Greg? Please practice responsible journalism and use full quote. Pachacutec_
emptywheel	721368044530974720	2016-04-16T16:01:58	ThePlumLineGS I've said I don't think Goldman speeches are what Bernie suggests they are, I base that on HILLARY'S explanation Pachacutec_
emptywheel	721367910615228416	2016-04-16T16:01:26	ThePlumLineGS And again, I'm not sure why it's fair to ALWAYS ascribe to partisanship to me, and not internalization to you? Pachacutec_
emptywheel	721367676099170304	2016-04-16T16:00:31	ThePlumLineGS NO! Again, you're saying your interpretation off partial quote = "Explicit." That's not English, Greg. Pachacutec_
emptywheel	721367463468920832	2016-04-16T15:59:40	eggertma Yup. I once made the effort to figure out which male Senators voting against birth control probably benefitted from it.

emptywheel	721366881819631617	2016-04-16T15:57:21	ThePlumLineGS "At least as"? You're the judge? Even though you keep editing quotes? OK, sure. Pachacutec_

emptywheel	721362626786246656	2016-04-16T15:40:27	ThePlumLineGS Bash did not say, "Name action Hillary took bc GS paid her." She said, Name policy H took bc she favors banks Pachacutec_
emptywheel	721362406539141120	2016-04-16T15:39:34	ThePlumLineGS Contrary to your failure to quote directly, Bash was asking abt Hillary favoring, not Hillary QPQing Pachacutec_
emptywheel	721362245872181249	2016-04-16T15:38:56	ThePlumLineGS Here's what it says: "shows that he [sic] favored banks" which is the OPPOSITE of what you're arguing. Pachacutec_

emptywheel	721360440891207681	2016-04-16T15:31:45	ThePlumLineGS Yes, Hillary puts "rigged economy" into envelope and leaves it in a dead drop. You're playing word games, Greg. Pachacutec_
emptywheel	721360134954491904	2016-04-16T15:30:33	ThePlumLineGS MY point is you're moving the goal posts, even in your piece, and especially here, Pachacutec_

emptywheel	721358424823439361	2016-04-16T15:23:45	ThePlumLineGS "Directly linked." There you go back to QPQ again. Pachacutec_
emptywheel	721358023462121472	2016-04-16T15:22:09	ThePlumLineGS Does that come from bank $$, or that she spends so much time with them? Those issues are linked. Pachacutec_

emptywheel	718079557161598976	2016-04-07T14:14:42	ThePlumLineGS But it is PRECISELY what Bernie doing. After months and months of Hillary doing same w/no criticism now it's out of bounds?
emptywheel	718079184011149314	2016-04-07T14:13:13	ThePlumLineGS Um, yes. But it is argument based NOT on evidence and outcomes but on self-selecting certification divorced from facts.
emptywheel	718079005488988161	2016-04-07T14:12:30	ThePlumLineGS Furthermore, you endorse divorcing policy positions from known outcomes so long as bigwigs say "wonk" enough times?

emptywheel	718078378482524160	2016-04-07T14:10:01	ThePlumLineGS But YOU are making more extended claim, which is why you should consider "wonk" policing that Hillary's surrogates engage in

emptywheel	713066358297268224	2016-03-24T18:14:02	JZdziarski Sure. But his statement goes beyond what Perino's did.
emptywheel	713065981460000768	2016-03-24T18:12:32	Susan_Hennessey Can you point to where 1) outside sources were considered here 2) Apple agreed no other way to get in? You cit DOJ claim.
emptywheel	713064333375377408	2016-03-24T18:05:59	This, from Apple's Erik Neuenschwander, is in context abt Cellebrite.   
emptywheel	713063345440628737	2016-03-24T18:02:04	JZdziarski Especially when DOJ generally was, AT THE VERY SAME TIME, asking about cracking iPhone 6es?
emptywheel	713063149478494208	2016-03-24T18:01:17	JZdziarski Let me rephrase: Why would she ask exclusively abt lower level tool rather than Cellebrite's advertised ability to crack iOS 8?
emptywheel	713062913678946304	2016-03-24T18:00:21	GOP probably now screaming in some office: "We've mastered suppressing vote of poors, youngs, blacks, &amp; browns. How do we suppress women?!?"

emptywheel	713062195383431168	2016-03-24T17:57:30	Xboxershorts Nah, she named the manual by, um, name.   But again, I DO think they called Cellebrite or someone similar b4 Apple.

emptywheel	713061529667649536	2016-03-24T17:54:51	FBI Claimed It Consulted a Manual Rather Than Cellebrite Directly    (I think it likely they DID consult Cellebrite)
emptywheel	713060751376781312	2016-03-24T17:51:45	JZdziarski And remember, she was going to be available to testify about that declaration on Tuesday.
emptywheel	713060610670477313	2016-03-24T17:51:12	JZdziarski I trust you're absolutely correct that she'd be negligent not doing more. But that's what her dec says.
emptywheel	713060213046255616	2016-03-24T17:49:37	JZdziarski That may be. But why would Perino ask Cellebrite about a tool she knows wouldn't work rather than ones that might?
emptywheel	713054748031729664	2016-03-24T17:27:54	JZdziarski It's one thing to say, "Cellebrite has tool that only works for older than 4S," another to say, "they also claim to break iOS 8"
emptywheel	713054357785280512	2016-03-24T17:26:21	JZdziarski To be clear, I think it highly likely they DID contact Cellebrite.  Just think dec did not admit they did
emptywheel	713054160657256448	2016-03-24T17:25:34	JZdziarski Sure but UFED is not the way Cellebrite would open that phone. Perino's declaration didn't stand up on several other counts.
emptywheel	713053344122675201	2016-03-24T17:22:19	JZdziarski I think that's a misreading of Perino dec:  She read UFED manual, does not claim to have called them.

emptywheel	712661911087804416	2016-03-23T15:26:54	ErrataRob Adding, Comey was very squirrely when answering whether NSA could crack phone. He said "not 5C running 9."

emptywheel	712659816490074112	2016-03-23T15:18:35	JayAckroyd Right. But realignment I think I meant behavioral recognition among voting blocks.

emptywheel	712656260458479616	2016-03-23T15:04:27	ErrataRob Agree. But DOJ ALWAYS (19X) said only option was FBI or Apple. Also now suggest Cellebrite called out of blue.

emptywheel	712655731196096512	2016-03-23T15:02:21	ErrataRob My point is just that DOJ can't claim Cellebrite wasn't an option when we know they had to have been discussing THAT phone.

emptywheel	711576682637950978	2016-03-20T15:34:36	rcallimachi So your presumption is a laptop got entirely destroyed but not the burner phones that fit in pockets? josephfcox
emptywheel	711576201190612992	2016-03-20T15:32:41	rcallimachi Seems like a question worth answering, esp since eyewitnesses at Bataclan would be stressed  so less reliable josephfcox
