susie_c	717583218711535616	2016-04-06T05:22:26	Fun theme emerging here that landlords believe protected renters are making "$300,000 a year," "so much money," etc.
susie_c	717581599462658048	2016-04-06T05:15:59	"Household income" is pretty clearly not the same as "individual income" 10Niel
susie_c	717581221119721472	2016-04-06T05:14:29	omg cue the inevitable white guy who misread income data on  jfc oakmtg
susie_c	717580792830898176	2016-04-06T05:12:47	No matter how many laws, ordinances, or states of emergency are passed, this is the fundamental problem with Oakland's rent laws.
susie_c	717577773452124165	2016-04-06T05:00:47	bluecinema presumably as other landlords have, to speak against the measure

susie_c	717564101707190272	2016-04-06T04:06:28	alloverthisland I hope you'll consider it -- 
susie_c	717563197247520768	2016-04-06T04:02:52	alloverthisland it's not that simple, you have rights, people win these petitions all the time. it's hard but it's worth it.
susie_c	717562562485727232	2016-04-06T04:00:21	alloverthisland file a formal petition so there's a paper trail if they retaliate
susie_c	717561729329201152	2016-04-06T03:57:02	I'm personally invested in this vote -- a moratorium would at least temporarily pause our own landlord dispute (hearing's in May).
susie_c	717561202616848384	2016-04-06T03:54:57	jcreech3 I didn't say "constrain supply"

susie_c	717560729050611712	2016-04-06T03:53:04	e_dub_s it's objectively amazing that this is how ordinances are ever enforced, let alone when abuse is widely acknowledged
susie_c	717560022184513536	2016-04-06T03:50:15	e_dub_s the dynamic is fundamentally broken -- forces the less powerful entity to start a lengthy, complex confrontation

susie_c	717554044596723712	2016-04-06T03:26:30	Oakland's renter protections essentially work like: landlords do whatever they want unless renters spend the time + resources to fight back.
susie_c	717553771371319296	2016-04-06T03:25:25	CM Kaplan: "Many of the evictions taking place in Oakland right now are actually illegal. But ppl do not know that they have those rights."

susie_c	717545441970102274	2016-04-06T02:52:19	This contentious vote to officially define Oakland by how it survives violence is exceptionally symbolic of a changing city

susie_c	700404692640116736	2016-02-18T19:41:06	mediadissector petersterne It depends so much on the pay and the type of work. Freelance can work for both parties.
susie_c	700403946133655553	2016-02-18T19:38:08	mediadissector petersterne It's certainly difficult to expect freelancers to do regular daily churn. Most aggregators seem to be staff.

susie_c	700399654278565888	2016-02-18T19:21:05	RickPaulas It depends so much on the editor + publication too. Lots of respondents say freelancers bring valuable skills + expertise.
susie_c	700399166447423488	2016-02-18T19:19:08	petersterne Right, but it certainly depends on what each is writing and how much they're paid.
