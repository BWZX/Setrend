richardquest	722734516788264961	2016-04-20T10:31:51	Just arrived in london. Magnificent spring day. Stunning clear blue skies. Long may it last
richardquest	722734174830927872	2016-04-20T10:30:29	bouleg812 so don't watch me. There: your problem solved
richardquest	722734019532619776	2016-04-20T10:29:52	sevendaywonders what is your point ?
richardquest	722733996853956608	2016-04-20T10:29:47	sevendaywonders your point is?? (Since I have addressed this issue a thousand times but you haven't researched the answers)
richardquest	722733832680570880	2016-04-20T10:29:08	sevendaywonders yup because we went round the world.

richardquest	721815272991145984	2016-04-17T21:39:06	bendonathen TravelisFree but anyway. This is getting silly. If people wish to try and make hay off our back, so be it. I ain't engaging
richardquest	721815101024681984	2016-04-17T21:38:25	bendonathen TravelisFree it's not the same route it's just the same continents.
richardquest	721814660530446336	2016-04-17T21:36:40	faisalb TravelisFree so sorry.
richardquest	721814645191884802	2016-04-17T21:36:36	faisalb TravelisFree I have been covering aviation travel for 25 years
richardquest	721814562236993537	2016-04-17T21:36:16	faisalb TravelisFree except there is nothing to give credit for. We didn't get the idea from him.
richardquest	721783878646636545	2016-04-17T19:34:21	TravelisFree OneMileataTime and add a sub Saharan Africa leg - and do it all in 8 days.
richardquest	721783780915159040	2016-04-17T19:33:58	TravelisFree OneMileataTime same rules. 1 start and stop same apt 2 same direction no backtracking 3 cross Atlantic and Pacific
richardquest	721783642901639168	2016-04-17T19:33:25	TravelisFree OneMileataTime now to the future. Plan a RTW which has Africa in it. In 8 days
richardquest	721783465583255554	2016-04-17T19:32:42	TravelisFree OneMileataTime it's the same idea. Except I had never read your article. Oh. And we did it - not just write about it.
richardquest	721783112544493568	2016-04-17T19:31:18	OneMileataTime TravelisFree bg26892 I refer the honourable gentlemen to the answer I gave some months, weeks, days, hours ago!
richardquest	721782911515627521	2016-04-17T19:30:30	TravelisFree OneMileataTime bg26892 theres no other way to make it work without them
richardquest	721782855572004864	2016-04-17T19:30:17	TravelisFree OneMileataTime bg26892 obviously major transit points will be included: London. dubai. KL/SIN. SYD. HNL. NYC.
richardquest	721782549882789893	2016-04-17T19:29:04	TravelisFree OneMileataTime bg26892 you do Europe to gulf to Asia to Australia to America to Europe. It's the only way
richardquest	721782479477161984	2016-04-17T19:28:47	TravelisFree OneMileataTime bg26892 not wishing to be difficult - but how else would you go round the world in LCC??
richardquest	721782182822473728	2016-04-17T19:27:37	TravelisFree OneMileataTime bg26892 so I don't know what more to say. We both had the same idea. We did in on TV
richardquest	721782034436333568	2016-04-17T19:27:01	TravelisFree OneMileataTime bg26892 other projects and my schedule meant we were never able to do it until this year.
richardquest	721781942430076928	2016-04-17T19:26:39	TravelisFree OneMileataTime bg26892 oh and yes. I have the emails to my management all this year's ago when I started getting it
richardquest	721781776948031488	2016-04-17T19:26:00	TravelisFree OneMileataTime bg26892 me. I have been trying to get CNN to let me do this for about 3 years.
richardquest	721781544424226816	2016-04-17T19:25:04	OneMileataTime bg26892 TravelisFree son- if you came up with this idea as well, it just shows there's no such thing as original ideas
richardquest	721781387255275521	2016-04-17T19:24:27	OneMileataTime bg26892 TravelisFree we needed air Asia as the largest in region. We needed to show long haul low cost
richardquest	721781298663190529	2016-04-17T19:24:06	OneMileataTime bg26892 TravelisFree ours was designed around editorial. Ie we needed to show EZ and FR. We needed a Gulf airline too
richardquest	721781109105782784	2016-04-17T19:23:21	OneMileataTime bg26892 TravelisFree but most important: we had a TV programme to make editorial points about the development of LCC
richardquest	721780975097802754	2016-04-17T19:22:49	OneMileataTime bg26892 TravelisFree I hate to burst the bubble 1. It's not an original idea for either of us 2. We had different criteria
richardquest	721429023142895616	2016-04-16T20:04:17	KadalieRhoda fm_pena nothing I say will convince you otherwise. No need to reply further

richardquest	720804271491588096	2016-04-15T02:41:44	.moyo_buhle SureKamhunga  sadly richardquest is right, you can't get into &amp; around Africa on low-cost carriers.
richardquest	720931052043268096	2016-04-15T11:05:31	mohamed_felata a wise viewer
richardquest	720930932207853569	2016-04-15T11:05:03	oleblue1958_jim I know. It's the hidden suggestion that somehow it was a deliberate slight that I am aiming to destroy
richardquest	720930486500126720	2016-04-15T11:03:16	Idiot_wanderer but I appreciate your trying!  We looked at numerous options.
richardquest	720930424294404096	2016-04-15T11:03:02	1. Condor is classified as Full Service by CAPA not low cost 2. ZNZ/DXB would have backtracked us. Not allowed under our rules
richardquest	720930047880785921	2016-04-15T11:01:32	PeddersUK it's fun to do over breakfast in Washington. Beats reading the paper

richardquest	720929513148911616	2016-04-15T10:59:24	moyo_buhle Ricky27_263 SureKamhunga simple. Over regulation and protection of existing airlines.
richardquest	720929325604855808	2016-04-15T10:58:40	aelhu fernandes_gl charming.
richardquest	720929167903219714	2016-04-15T10:58:02	This never ending obsession that somehow we "avoided" going to Africa on flywithquest is wearying if it wasn't so laughable
richardquest	720928712317870082	2016-04-15T10:56:13	Iangithinji here we go again. And how do we get INTO and OUT of Africa so the whole thing connects with the rest of the world?
richardquest	720928543048409089	2016-04-15T10:55:33	RyDollaSign but it's true. It wasn't possible

richardquest	720697950297538560	2016-04-14T19:39:15	KadalieRhoda fm_pena you just don't accept it when I say it
richardquest	720697903401013249	2016-04-14T19:39:04	KadalieRhoda fm_pena happy to continue but little purpose in doing so. You have a view. I don't
richardquest	720697380576866305	2016-04-14T19:37:00	KadalieRhoda fm_pena you have made your point and won't agree with mine
richardquest	720697232878604288	2016-04-14T19:36:24	rhoutepen oh That will not get rid of the critics I guarantee.
richardquest	720697046949347328	2016-04-14T19:35:40	Lukafoto you can't get into and Africa easily
richardquest	720696961603616768	2016-04-14T19:35:20	Lukafoto do your research before you make such comments
richardquest	720696825880166400	2016-04-14T19:34:47	jaigilbert fastjet thank you. We would love to have visited. But you know the issues etc.
richardquest	720582934240038912	2016-04-14T12:02:13	dan_ouma airarabiagroup FlyJambojet fly540aviation we will
richardquest	720582799112204289	2016-04-14T12:01:41	Jkm920213 tinasheribatika but BA and VS are not LCC!!!
richardquest	720582690672615426	2016-04-14T12:01:15	jozinen why are you wearing a bowl on your head? Or dare I ask??
richardquest	720582344369954816	2016-04-14T11:59:53	dan_ouma airarabiagroup FlyJambojet fly540aviation we looked at it again and again.
richardquest	720582265869312000	2016-04-14T11:59:34	dan_ouma airarabiagroup FlyJambojet fly540aviation and it all had to fit in with the rest of the schedule that only allowed 8 days
richardquest	720582109094670338	2016-04-14T11:58:57	dan_ouma airarabiagroup FlyJambojet fly540aviation ahh no. We had to keep going in one direction. Can't double back.
richardquest	720580622872354817	2016-04-14T11:53:02	I give up. No amount of explaining the lack of systemwide LCC in Africa will appease the critics on this one
richardquest	720580429515001856	2016-04-14T11:52:16	tinasheribatika and how does one connect to and from them? All within the week of the project?
richardquest	720579171349630976	2016-04-14T11:47:16	jozinen exactly. And how do we get in and out of there for the rest of the schedule. We looked at all of this
richardquest	720578956643147776	2016-04-14T11:46:25	paulwesch FlyMangoSA remember it had to fit into the whole schedule we didn't fly wizz or southwest or Cebu etx
richardquest	720578853639495681	2016-04-14T11:46:01	paulwesch FlyMangoSA and how do we get to the flymango gateway to make it work??
richardquest	720576627479080960	2016-04-14T11:37:10	jlangdale I know. Shocking. The one we could have done but didn't because of time was Latam. For similar reasons
richardquest	720576390106628096	2016-04-14T11:36:13	Idiot_wanderer of course we looked at fastjet but it's way too small to make it work with the rest
richardquest	720576300029751296	2016-04-14T11:35:52	Idiot_wanderer one airline. With limited routes. That would not have connected with other flights in the schedule.
richardquest	720575936610058240	2016-04-14T11:34:25	KadalieRhoda that is not the same thing as being biased. He is the one who has taken such controversial positions that need hard questions.
richardquest	720575814480355329	2016-04-14T11:33:56	KadalieRhoda what you don't like is the fact that trump has more questions to answer because of his inexperience and campaign so far
richardquest	720575705910755330	2016-04-14T11:33:30	KadalieRhoda we are hard on sanders Clinton Cruz the lot
richardquest	720575631503790080	2016-04-14T11:33:12	KadalieRhoda if you watch our coverage you will find we treat all the same. You won't agree with my comment I realise that. But it's true
richardquest	720575505276223492	2016-04-14T11:32:42	fernandes_gl it's far easier to criticise us than face the reason we didn't go there
richardquest	720574996641357824	2016-04-14T11:30:41	socalmike_SD not with all low cost and a great deal of hassle no
richardquest	720573849432166400	2016-04-14T11:26:07	KadalieRhoda and you are neutral
richardquest	720573501313302529	2016-04-14T11:24:44	You should be demanding to know, why Africa has been so slow to join the LCC revolution not why we didn't go there !!! flywithquest
richardquest	720573225797885952	2016-04-14T11:23:39	So before you all jump to criticising us - we looked at it and could not make it work either editorially or logistically flywithquest
richardquest	720573001826246656	2016-04-14T11:22:45	Before the chorus starts up again. we didn't go to Africa on flywithquest because there are no African low cost carriers that we could use
richardquest	720572534232584192	2016-04-14T11:20:54	9c231205d837448 you tell me how we could have done it.  Go on
richardquest	720572477626269696	2016-04-14T11:20:40	9c231205d837448 it is not possible. Stop trying to find hidden reasons where none exist
richardquest	720572328191664128	2016-04-14T11:20:05	9c231205d837448 oh give it a rest. I have explained a million times why. There are no pan African low cost carriers that we could use
richardquest	720413764110168064	2016-04-14T00:50:00	monfrat no. I thought about that. 45 mins home and 45 mins back. And I walked the 10 mins to hebhotel
richardquest	720413551245008896	2016-04-14T00:49:09	NymLotay I am not whining. I am making the point about how expensive hotels are
richardquest	720413414091288576	2016-04-14T00:48:37	KadalieRhoda but perhaps you are indeed only minded to one point of view.  I prefer to hear both sides
richardquest	720413294276661248	2016-04-14T00:48:08	KadalieRhoda and that 'outsider' as you call him, happens to be a prime minister of another country
richardquest	720413139452489728	2016-04-14T00:47:31	KadalieRhoda oh please. You obviously didn't listen to a word or you would have heard me say that he has a point on the delegate count
richardquest	720184314105880576	2016-04-13T09:38:15	gamdede no. It's because it was the logical place to sleep for a few hours before getting back in the road
richardquest	720184132203069440	2016-04-13T09:37:32	What are you going to do? Gotta sleep somewhere for a few hours... And the Marriott is the only on-airport hotel at EWR?
richardquest	720182723684540417	2016-04-13T09:31:56	Grandpois piersmorgan just curious about why anyone decides to hurl gratuitous insults on Twitter  if you don't like us: don't watch
richardquest	720182526170566657	2016-04-13T09:31:09	Grandpois piersmorgan why do you feel the need to be rude to me?
richardquest	720182347874889728	2016-04-13T09:30:26	Onwards!
richardquest	720182268417961985	2016-04-13T09:30:07	Got into EWR at midnight last night. Stayed at airport hotel. By my reckoning I paid $70 per hour for time in room!!

richardquest	719682278297702400	2016-04-12T00:23:20	@HermannJP06 it natural.

richardquest	701533149680033792	2016-02-21T22:25:11	By all means deny the police etc access but there'll be a cost. are you ready to accept that?  That's all I am asking you to think about
richardquest	701532855156002816	2016-02-21T22:24:01	Paris. Brussels. Tunisia, Metrojet, the list goes on. Apple and Google don't have the duty of protecting us from terror.

richardquest	701531892143804418	2016-02-21T22:20:11	jackgoesvirtual that is my point. The police have to protect us physically. All I am saying is recognise that there will be a cost to this
richardquest	701531741719240704	2016-02-21T22:19:35	jackgoesvirtual then you have made a choice. But there will be a price to pay if/when law enforcement can't get information.
richardquest	701470000138350594	2016-02-21T18:14:15	The problem is simple. The answer is anything but. We all have a vested interest on both sides  what's YOUR view?
richardquest	701469769799704581	2016-02-21T18:13:20	Apple v FBI it' s all about what price we as a society are prepared to pay.  Read my opinion piece
