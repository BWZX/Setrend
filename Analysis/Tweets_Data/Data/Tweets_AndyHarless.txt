AndyHarless	692872575345565696	2016-01-29T00:51:09	MacRoweNick Right now, though (for the US, at least), it seems that prices derived from capital costs are the only ones going up.
AndyHarless	692872020200062977	2016-01-29T00:48:57	MacRoweNick Normally this effect is outweighed by labor costs in the short run and swamped by them in the long run as it disappears.
AndyHarless	692871447379730432	2016-01-29T00:46:40	MacRoweNick But it's true that monetary policy has paradoxical short-run effects on the capital component of costs.
AndyHarless	692869822502141953	2016-01-29T00:40:13	Rising rents mean rates have been too high for the real economy, and falling everything else means they have been too high for inflation.
AndyHarless	692869060946632704	2016-01-29T00:37:11	If rent is the only thing going up, shouldn't the Fed be encouraging building by keeping rates low?

AndyHarless	692734503874355200	2016-01-28T15:42:30	MacRoweNick Also adaptive agents become a sunspot for RE. Much cheaper for CB 2 b credible when it has a monopoly in the sunspot business.
AndyHarless	692728870332690432	2016-01-28T15:20:07	MacRoweNick Well, eg, with adaptive inflation expectations &amp; high variance of AS shocks, you need some pretty big intentional recessions
AndyHarless	692727873216593920	2016-01-28T15:16:09	MacRoweNick ...the more reality deviates from RE (even if we know exactly how), the larger the forecastable recessions need to be
AndyHarless	692727529711484930	2016-01-28T15:14:47	MacRoweNick OK, w perfect RE &amp; perfect policy regime, only need infinitesimally small forecastable recessions, but even w perfect regime...
AndyHarless	692722124750995458	2016-01-28T14:53:19	MacRoweNick I think yes even in theory: in order to be credible, signal of policy intention must be costly
AndyHarless	692720700625395712	2016-01-28T14:47:39	MacRoweNick And almost certainly, the optimal policy will be one that sometimes implies targets where AS=/=AD
AndyHarless	692717847252967424	2016-01-28T14:36:19	MacRoweNick (Even w perfect RE &amp; AD=AS target, any price path is an equilibrium, so you only need a modicum of adaptive to make a sunspot)
AndyHarless	692715859597475840	2016-01-28T14:28:25	MacRoweNick (w adaptive infl expectations &amp; AD=AS target, unanticipated AS shocks will cause inflation rate to drift. Arguably prob w 70s)
AndyHarless	692714265208291330	2016-01-28T14:22:05	MacRoweNick And even "perfect" policy of targeting AD=AS runs risk of instability in response to unanticipated shock (so isn't perfect)
AndyHarless	692713368000544774	2016-01-28T14:18:31	MacRoweNick Come to think of it, I am sure, if u arbitrarily control path of AD, u will get times when AS &lt;&gt; AD. Will you say NGDPLT fails?
AndyHarless	692712760849911808	2016-01-28T14:16:06	MacRoweNick Hmm...I'm not sure, but I think w adaptive inflation expectations u can get AD&lt;AS sometimes even w perfectly implemented NGDPLT
AndyHarless	692711153810698241	2016-01-28T14:09:43	Money buys happiness on average, but the error variance is very high.
AndyHarless	692710941205602304	2016-01-28T14:08:52	MacRoweNick Even by latter definition, intentional recession can be rational response to unanticipated AS shock that throws infl off target
AndyHarless	692709734328242177	2016-01-28T14:04:05	MacRoweNick It is (would be) a strong indication. I don't think it's even a sufficient condition, given possibly of large AS shifts.
