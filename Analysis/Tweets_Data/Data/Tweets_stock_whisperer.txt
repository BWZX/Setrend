stock_whisperer	688787314441494528	2016-01-17T18:17:47	jimcramer which oscillator?
stock_whisperer	688752550145732608	2016-01-17T15:59:39	LateRoundQB I agree. Also sudden death is exciting
stock_whisperer	688751600618229762	2016-01-17T15:55:52	LateRoundQB fair points. Slight advantage, not huge, same slight adv the team starting w the ball in the current format has IMO
stock_whisperer	688750241332371456	2016-01-17T15:50:28	LateRoundQB you’re under assumption the first team gets a td
stock_whisperer	688749242848940032	2016-01-17T15:46:30	AlderLaneeggs I’m not trolling here, but have you ever considered that you are wrong on Canada re?
stock_whisperer	688748710944100352	2016-01-17T15:44:23	LateRoundQB that is VERY flawed logic
stock_whisperer	688748455372521472	2016-01-17T15:43:22	LateRoundQB I have no dog in this fight but I don’t see how the team getting the ball second would have an adv in the other scenario
stock_whisperer	688578290529927168	2016-01-17T04:27:12	4for4_John and it will be criminal if this Janis td is taken away, that is a catch
stock_whisperer	688572791310778368	2016-01-17T04:05:21	4for4_John dez’s wasn’t a catch nor was he ever a runner
stock_whisperer	688572504374251520	2016-01-17T04:04:12	4for4_John he was a runner, your home team bias is clouding your judgement, we are all guilty of that
stock_whisperer	688571871306989569	2016-01-17T04:01:41	4for4_John so a player can catch the ball, run 90 yards and fall to the ground and lose control and it’s not a catch youarewrong fanbias
stock_whisperer	688571373128527872	2016-01-17T03:59:43	4for4_John not true if you take several steps after the catch
stock_whisperer	688570899285458944	2016-01-17T03:57:50	4for4_John per the rule it was, you may be slightly bias on this one
