loisbeckett	713369378310529025	2016-03-25T14:18:08	6) A policing expert and a social services expert both told me the damage being done right now in Chicago could take a generation to fix.
loisbeckett	713368870896156672	2016-03-25T14:16:07	5) Cuts to the safety net at the same time as a pullback on proactive policing is the "worst of all worlds" one crime expert told me.

loisbeckett	713365663801282560	2016-03-25T14:03:22	So why have shootings doubled in Chicago this year? Potential factors:  1) A state budget crisis causing massive cuts to social services...
