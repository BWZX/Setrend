lachlan	715279564096847872	2016-03-30T20:48:31	Of course this would completely tear apart the GOP, but if it‚Äôs not totally clear by now, Trump does not give two shits about the party.
lachlan	715279412250460160	2016-03-30T20:47:55	Come 2017, his brand is hotter than its ever been and he can do pretty much whatever he wants ‚Äì which I don‚Äôt think is actually politics.
lachlan	715279282411593728	2016-03-30T20:47:24	He would maintain his public persona, cement his status as an anti-establishment hero, but never actually have to do any icky governing.
lachlan	715279136042983424	2016-03-30T20:46:49	He‚Äôs banking on a brokered convention. He wants to be robbed so he can say that he was actually the winner but the establishment fucked him.
lachlan	715278976105713664	2016-03-30T20:46:11	So he triples down on the Michelle Fields fiasco, says some crazy shit about abortion, Cruz crushes it in WI, momentum shifts.
lachlan	715278852226940928	2016-03-30T20:45:42	But he can‚Äôt just drop out. He‚Äôs a winner after all. And he needs to preserve his winner persona, for the sake of his ego if nothing else.
lachlan	715278701974458369	2016-03-30T20:45:06	And now he realizes what a shit job this would be. And maybe, just maybe, he‚Äôs not entirely sure that he‚Äôs up to the immense task.
lachlan	715278555274457088	2016-03-30T20:44:31	I don‚Äôt think he ever actually wanted to be POTUS. He just wanted to be able to say he *could* be if he chose to do so. Winning, etc.
