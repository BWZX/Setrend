exMBB	683237388223660032	2016-01-02T10:44:21	I don't get the valuation gap b/t W and OSTK. Both are crappy businesses. Though I can see AMZN buying OSTK. Fulfillment synergies
exMBB	683236466818957312	2016-01-02T10:40:42	W is a good short. Everything you can find on Wayfair, you can find on OSTK for 10-15% less. You save even more by using OSTK coupons
