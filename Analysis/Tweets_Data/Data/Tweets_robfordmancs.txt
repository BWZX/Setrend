robfordmancs	723494146116333568	2016-04-22T12:50:20	So, to sum up, Boris propagated a lie about Obama's behaviour, then attribed the motive for that lie to his "ancestry". This is our next PM?
robfordmancs	723493714790887424	2016-04-22T12:48:38	So Obama demonstrated his "ancestral rage" against GB by returning to GB govt the stuff Bush had borrowed off Blair:

robfordmancs	714155952723914752	2016-03-27T18:23:42	GabrielNeil AdamRamsay Ross_Greer I agree. I'm not sure there's even much a Scottish Lab ldr can do in SR. Shifts in electorate too deep
robfordmancs	714155751720284160	2016-03-27T18:22:54	AdamRamsay GabrielNeil Ross_Greer so the Corbynistas have leant on Scotland to justify electability claims.

robfordmancs	710955497516634116	2016-03-18T22:26:14	I think Universal Credit is a fine (and not all that radical) idea but by the end IDS saw it in mystical terms. An elixir for the poor.

robfordmancs	710819185262202880	2016-03-18T13:24:34	Precisely- just as chronic insecurity in 1930s also left lasting imprint on voters growing up then 
robfordmancs	710819007201452033	2016-03-18T13:23:52	Sam_Dumitriu JananGanesh Exactly!

robfordmancs	710818348544688128	2016-03-18T13:21:15	JananGanesh Sam_Dumitriu why would they not say: "yes, I like the internet, but I would like to buy a house too".
robfordmancs	710818194500558851	2016-03-18T13:20:38	JananGanesh Sam_Dumitriu so I don't see why the fact of progress implies political quiescence on the part of the young
robfordmancs	710818069594185729	2016-03-18T13:20:08	JananGanesh Sam_Dumitriu That's your frame, but I'm not willing to accept it.A trip in the TARDIS isn't on the political agenda for anyone
robfordmancs	710817817113788416	2016-03-18T13:19:08	JananGanesh Sam_Dumitriu to which the honest answer is "planning restrictions, backed up by the political power of yr grandparents".
robfordmancs	710817643893297152	2016-03-18T13:18:27	JananGanesh Sam_Dumitriu which is kind of the point - young will ask "why can't we have internet AND a nice house nr a good school?"
robfordmancs	710817524317863936	2016-03-18T13:17:58	JananGanesh Sam_Dumitriu Not my experience. But in any event, its irrelevant - no one is going to have to make the trade anyway.
robfordmancs	710817424724066304	2016-03-18T13:17:35	JananGanesh Sam_Dumitriu you think most people would favour their own access to internet over their kids access to a good school?
robfordmancs	710817303395504129	2016-03-18T13:17:06	Sam_Dumitriu JananGanesh which is sometimes chosen, but also often forced by today's circumstances.
robfordmancs	710816798396915715	2016-03-18T13:15:05	Sam_Dumitriu JananGanesh That's the other thing about Janan's whole list: is it is individual focussed. Things look different to families
robfordmancs	710816603231887361	2016-03-18T13:14:19	Sam_Dumitriu JananGanesh iPads are great, but I think anyone with kids wld trade for housing security and access to good schools
robfordmancs	710815014832226304	2016-03-18T13:08:00	CasMudde JananGanesh you mean it might just be a coincidence, or product of other non age related factors?
robfordmancs	710814773462605824	2016-03-18T13:07:02	DionGeorgiou don't really think the economic suffering of millenials is quite same league. Also: no world war (hopefully)
robfordmancs	710814692483190784	2016-03-18T13:06:43	DionGeorgiou this is what arguably happened with the Depression cohort - had distinct views for a lifetime. Not sure this will be same
robfordmancs	710814491307548672	2016-03-18T13:05:55	Widerife81 JananGanesh maybe - its hard to know until someone tries it.
robfordmancs	710814265704357888	2016-03-18T13:05:01	However, what matters politically is whether young believe they are getting a uniquely raw deal, not whether that belief is accurate
robfordmancs	710814121147678720	2016-03-18T13:04:27	All that said, I agree with JananGanesh that it is silly to argue millenials "uniquely cursed". 1/2
robfordmancs	710813781006360576	2016-03-18T13:03:06	DionGeorgiou probably, on some things. Probably not, on others. As always!
robfordmancs	710813654988529667	2016-03-18T13:02:36	JananGanesh Doesn't matter whether, eg, US milennials view themselves as a coherent group - if they vote like one that's the whole deal
robfordmancs	710813497257492480	2016-03-18T13:01:58	JananGanesh it doesn't, but it suggests they recognise a common interest (or a basket of same). Which is politically very relevant
robfordmancs	710813179387977728	2016-03-18T13:00:42	There's nothing in politics that obliges young people to frame the choice in the way JananGanesh frames it - so why would they?
robfordmancs	710813000517742592	2016-03-18T13:00:00	Its rather like arguing that poorer voters won't favour redistribution because, hey, in the 1930s people like them got nothing from govt
robfordmancs	710812754052038656	2016-03-18T12:59:01	It is also really odd to argue that young people will ignore current generational injustices because some things were worse in 1960s 1/2
robfordmancs	710812449478483968	2016-03-18T12:57:48	Sam_Dumitriu JananGanesh you may feel different about that when you have kids and 15 yrs in 12 month leases under your belt Sam

robfordmancs	710811862313603072	2016-03-18T12:55:28	If age doesn't influence interests and votes, why JananGanesh is Tory/UKIP vote so concentrated among over 50s, Lab/Grn among under 35s?
robfordmancs	710811697020334080	2016-03-18T12:54:49	. JananGanesh says no one would identify with an age cohort. Yet cohort differences in vote choice have never been larger 2/3
robfordmancs	710811578589954052	2016-03-18T12:54:21	That's from this column, well written as usual, but the insouciance is empirically unfounded (1/2)

robfordmancs	710769553266049024	2016-03-18T10:07:21	GavinHJackson JeyyLowe think she is (a) excellent representative of her local area (b) powerful representative for black Caribbean women
robfordmancs	710769437750784000	2016-03-18T10:06:54	GavinHJackson JeyyLowe it is perfectly consistent, eg, for me to think Diane Abbott's positions on many issues are crackers and also 1/2
robfordmancs	710769359506042880	2016-03-18T10:06:35	GavinHJackson JeyyLowe no not really - one can criticise an MP's positions on certain issues without wanting them removed
robfordmancs	710768818264608768	2016-03-18T10:04:26	GavinHJackson JeyyLowe not the same though - criticising an MP is not same as actively organising to remove them.

robfordmancs	710768247772213249	2016-03-18T10:02:10	GavinHJackson JeyyLowe that's bad for her constituents, and for the country. MP's do a lot of good work - constit service takes up 60% of

robfordmancs	710765681864806400	2016-03-18T09:51:58	GavinHJackson yes, that's certainly true, but its the combination of entryism and deselection lobbying, which is v redolent of early 80s.
robfordmancs	710765517750050816	2016-03-18T09:51:19	GavinHJackson so white middle class people mobilising to remove BME representatives just looks really, really bad.
robfordmancs	710765425680896001	2016-03-18T09:50:57	GavinHJackson 2/2 Specifically with ethnic minority politicians, because symbolic representation is important to EM voters &amp; activists

robfordmancs	710763911860129792	2016-03-18T09:44:56	GavinHJackson they disagreed with her politics. They didn't organise to get her de-selected. Quite a difference there.
