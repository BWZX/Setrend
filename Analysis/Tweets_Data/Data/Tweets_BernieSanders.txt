BernieSanders	718582565930606592	2016-04-08T23:33:28	In my view, we need to repeal the 1996 welfare reform provisions and expand, not weaken, the social safety net.
BernieSanders	718580308015079424	2016-04-08T23:24:30	In 2008, HillaryClinton said that “welfare should not be an anti-poverty program.” I disagree.
BernieSanders	718579893231943681	2016-04-08T23:22:51	This legislation has weakened the social safety net and increased extreme poverty. That is unacceptable.
BernieSanders	718579618668613633	2016-04-08T23:21:46	This legislation gave Republican governors like Scott Walker the responsibility to provide a safety net for families in need.
BernieSanders	718578025843937280	2016-04-08T23:15:26	In 1994, welfare provided a vital safety net to more than 14 million Americans. Today, it only helps 4.4 million.

BernieSanders	718577153990721536	2016-04-08T23:11:58	From 1996 to 2011, households living in EXTREME poverty increased 182% for African Americans; 132% for Hispanics; 109% for White Americans.
BernieSanders	718576515873517568	2016-04-08T23:09:26	The number of children in extreme poverty has skyrocketed from 1.4 million to 3.5 million.
BernieSanders	718576086318075905	2016-04-08T23:07:44	It established strict work requirements for receiving benefits and severely limited access to benefits for undocumented people.
BernieSanders	718575109032660992	2016-04-08T23:03:51	Since this legislation was signed into law, families living in extreme poverty have more than doubled from 636,000 to 1.65 million.
BernieSanders	718574348315938816	2016-04-08T23:00:49	It turns out that the welfare reform bill has been an absolute disaster.
BernieSanders	718573397253292032	2016-04-08T22:57:03	Unfortunately, HillaryClinton supported this bill calling it “a critical first step to reforming our nation’s welfare system.”
