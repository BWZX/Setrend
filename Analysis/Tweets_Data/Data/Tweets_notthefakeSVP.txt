notthefakeSVP	725937533423476736	2016-04-29T06:39:29	TinyDiscoDancer the context is: For the final time, a team has to manage a picture that depicts an issue as opposed to a story w/o one. Fin
notthefakeSVP	725936247936421889	2016-04-29T06:34:23	katienolan AaronNagler thank you. He's a superstar.
notthefakeSVP	725932861195345921	2016-04-29T06:20:55	TinyDiscoDancer I understand your point and am trying to respectfully address it. You continue to patronize. It's a treat.

notthefakeSVP	725931121234444288	2016-04-29T06:14:01	TinyDiscoDancer I'm not defensive. I said what I said. It wasn't apples to apples.  I only engage to try to help you understand my thoughts

notthefakeSVP	725926381079527424	2016-04-29T05:55:10	TinyDiscoDancer I didn't compare them. I can only explain it so many times
notthefakeSVP	725926195884249088	2016-04-29T05:54:26	Neeraj714 no question.  That picture is just something you decide you'll manage and you take him.  They did
notthefakeSVP	725926004951113728	2016-04-29T05:53:41	TheScottyDubz I don't care.  It was just a wild story that played out in real time.  His social media became story of night.
notthefakeSVP	725922026196598784	2016-04-29T05:37:52	Neeraj714 you and me both.  A team has to sell a guy to its fan base that has a bong buried in a gas mask.  Tough "optics".

notthefakeSVP	725919290696699906	2016-04-29T05:27:00	TinyDiscoDancer I was saying that the picture is something a team would have to explain at a presser.  Should have been more clear.
notthefakeSVP	725918169060106240	2016-04-29T05:22:33	TinyDiscoDancer anything that involves a picture is something a team has to deal with.   That's all.  Of course they're totally different
notthefakeSVP	725916495331483649	2016-04-29T05:15:54	Mackyceee thanks for following
notthefakeSVP	725916154661720065	2016-04-29T05:14:32	TinyDiscoDancer no.  I said a team having to explain a picture of something - whatever it is - is the challenge. Rice is clearly far worse
notthefakeSVP	725915274675781633	2016-04-29T05:11:02	relikx same in this way - a picture of ____ changes what people think.  Rice is obviously far worse. This isn't a big deal to ME
notthefakeSVP	725915003962822657	2016-04-29T05:09:58	nickriley24 no.  Said picture is same.   Hearing vs seeing changes how teams deal with things.  It's clearly not the same.
notthefakeSVP	725914796223131652	2016-04-29T05:09:08	nbaanalystespn I'm not saying anything of the sort.  I'm pro weed legalization.  Saying the issue is the picture.  Hearing vs seeing.
notthefakeSVP	725914604568604676	2016-04-29T05:08:23	ThemailmanJamie not what I was saying.   Saying a picture is what changes things.   One is clearly not the other
notthefakeSVP	725914459051421698	2016-04-29T05:07:48	LunchpailD it was story of night.
notthefakeSVP	725914016476864513	2016-04-29T05:06:03	TheScottyDubz gotta listen.  Said the picture of it is what makes it the issue.  It's not close to the same thing.
notthefakeSVP	725913847752577026	2016-04-29T05:05:22	duckraider of course not.  Seeing a picture of it means you have to address it.  Whatever it is.  But not comparable
notthefakeSVP	725913654290321408	2016-04-29T05:04:36	Neeraj714 seeing it as opposed to hearing about it.  Totally different.

notthefakeSVP	725367776509059073	2016-04-27T16:55:29	PortPowerAZ I just made fun of a press release in a piece making fun of press releases.  Take this up with someone else.
notthefakeSVP	725363145280262144	2016-04-27T16:37:05	PortPowerAZ no doubt there were many pro Seattle folks   People mad they lost their team.
notthefakeSVP	725362338283421696	2016-04-27T16:33:52	DMcmunigal but you're just intent on being smug and snarky, so I'll invite you to enjoy the day and I will say so long.

notthefakeSVP	725349999551385600	2016-04-27T15:44:50	DMcmunigal did you get either of those in the hour I did? No.  But cliches are easy.  So go with that.
notthefakeSVP	725349818474893312	2016-04-27T15:44:07	PortPowerAZ they are?   I missed those ratings, I guess. The logo is awesome.  The copy is silly   Try to lighten up.

notthefakeSVP	725223032441163776	2016-04-27T07:20:19	CasaDeEme It's not a stereotype of anything. It's the term used in baseball for 4 k's. Google it. Or don't. People blow my mind.

notthefakeSVP	723186293908353028	2016-04-21T16:27:03	ef_tony I am.  It's a hat that is what they call it and no malice or appropriation was implied.

notthefakeSVP	716475793971482624	2016-04-03T04:01:55	mjw1964 In no way is there a knock on UNC. It's simply acknowledging the facts of the path. There is no debating them.
notthefakeSVP	716475471865757696	2016-04-03T04:00:38	mjw1964 Almost certainly. But they already beat the overall one seed and a 2. You've played a 5 a 6 and a 10 the last 3 games. That's all

notthefakeSVP	712360899227623424	2016-03-22T19:30:48	stungate12 Nor were they they OVERWHELMING favorite to get to FF out of their region (they aren't in the same region as Kansas - Math)
notthefakeSVP	712360671212650496	2016-03-22T19:29:53	stungate12 You're right, Joe. UNC is the equivalent of Hampton and Holy Cross. They're not a 1 who is favored in the sweet 16
notthefakeSVP	712359225834524672	2016-03-22T19:24:09	mfortuna45 no doubt. But they're not a 5 seed from CP who is an underdog to Kansas, They're the 1 seed who is a favorite. haha.
notthefakeSVP	712358222871535617	2016-03-22T19:20:09	mfortuna45 It's not that at all. No beef here. As an old ACC guy, I assure you, I watched all year. Everyone thought this is what they'd be
notthefakeSVP	712357880423424001	2016-03-22T19:18:48	stungate12 You don't understand how math works and I'm not going to try to explain that being one of four picked to FF @ 42 % is a favorite
notthefakeSVP	712356525252222976	2016-03-22T19:13:25	mfortuna45 They're a 1 seed who is favored to beat IU. It's silly.
notthefakeSVP	712356003480793088	2016-03-22T19:11:20	mfortuna45 why are you doing this, by the way? They won ACC/Tourney and got a 1 seed. Who cares? Why not enjoy?
notthefakeSVP	712355006452776960	2016-03-22T19:07:23	mfortuna45 you had no wins other than Maryland. Everyone knew you were good but the resume stunk. It's why Wichita was an 11.
notthefakeSVP	712354096171368448	2016-03-22T19:03:46	mfortuna45 tarheelblog Their resume was the problem. Until late in the yr, they had very few wins of note. Seed projection reflected that

notthefakeSVP	712350212577226752	2016-03-22T18:48:20	tarheelblog bepryor WillBrinson So, they were picked to the final four in 42 % of brackets? The horror. Everyone knows how good they are.
notthefakeSVP	712347812822949888	2016-03-22T18:38:48	bepryor WillBrinson how do you get to do that when you're the one seed and everyone is picking them to get to Houston?  That's hilarious

notthefakeSVP	710996722613354496	2016-03-19T01:10:03	willbordo should've been up? they were down 18. Calls late were favorable. No doubt. Saying a team "should've won" who never lead is a joke

notthefakeSVP	710867868750102528	2016-03-18T16:38:01	Storm_Nudelmann fact remains, what they proved in regular season wasn't a ton.  Losing to tourney teams w/FVV isn't the goal.

notthefakeSVP	710531069863268352	2016-03-17T18:19:42	beachykeen22 call it whatever you'd like. It's their workspace.  Where they work.  A kid shouldn't be there every day.  Fin.
notthefakeSVP	710530451836903424	2016-03-17T18:17:15	beachykeen22 forgive me.  Didn't see this.  So we agree?  It's simply semantics of office/locker room
notthefakeSVP	710530254671052801	2016-03-17T18:16:28	beachykeen22 answer.....the....question.  How hard is it to do that?
notthefakeSVP	710530108944162818	2016-03-17T18:15:53	beachykeen22 weird how nobody else brought up nudity or x rated stories. Staples in locker rooms.  Which is their office.
notthefakeSVP	710529177762582530	2016-03-17T18:12:11	beachykeen22 you enjoy victim mode, huh? I didn't belittle you. I just think the central point is all that matters.  Answer the question.
notthefakeSVP	710528347823022082	2016-03-17T18:08:53	beachykeen22 who said that? I don't know who you are or if you are a man or a woman
notthefakeSVP	710528137751347201	2016-03-17T18:08:03	beachykeen22 lets just make this simple- you think it makes sense that a guy has his kid in the locker room every single day? I don't.
notthefakeSVP	710527889616281600	2016-03-17T18:07:04	adamberto7 I don't care what you do.  Or what you think of my picks
notthefakeSVP	710527702831394816	2016-03-17T18:06:19	beachykeen22 my point is it IS their workspace and the idea a kid should be they 24/7/375 is absurd.
notthefakeSVP	710527560346640384	2016-03-17T18:05:46	beachykeen22 your tweet implies you have no concept of what 25 baseball players discuss for 6 months . No idea how they behave.
notthefakeSVP	710526754851577857	2016-03-17T18:02:33	adamberto7 respect your final four = you picked the team I root for.  That's how this works. Pick your team? I'm great. Pick against? Hack
notthefakeSVP	710526457387290625	2016-03-17T18:01:23	beachykeen22 ScoobyCub how much time you spent in a locker room?
notthefakeSVP	710517954501332993	2016-03-17T17:27:35	Hockeyscout11 so, when there are four or five kids who are with a room of adults for 6 months of a season, that works?  We disagree.
notthefakeSVP	710516719526289408	2016-03-17T17:22:41	Hockeyscout11 every single day? Home and away? It's excessive
notthefakeSVP	710516573312782337	2016-03-17T17:22:06	Hockeyscout11 you have no idea if Williams isn't moving on this at the request of his players. What if Sale and Frazier want to bring kids?
notthefakeSVP	710515495271796736	2016-03-17T17:17:49	Hockeyscout11 gimme a break.  YOU know what it takes? So, every clubhouse is full of players kids every day? Guess I missed that.
notthefakeSVP	710515196301807617	2016-03-17T17:16:38	ScoobyCub now you're the one speculating.  My guess is they are cool with it in theory then the reality is more than they want to deal with
notthefakeSVP	710514101873680384	2016-03-17T17:12:17	ScoobyCub people like him.  They like the kid.  Slippery slope
notthefakeSVP	710513304104521728	2016-03-17T17:09:07	ScoobyCub maybe guys don't want to edit their language or their topics of conversation. WHATEVER. It's a work space even though it's sports
notthefakeSVP	710513164773953536	2016-03-17T17:08:33	ScoobyCub it apparently is now. Dial it back is a fair request. Maybe the team just got sick of it. Even though he's a good kid. He's a kid
notthefakeSVP	710511923150901248	2016-03-17T17:03:37	ScoobyCub Sale and Frazier decide they want THEIR kids in the clubhouse daily.  Now what?  Figure it out, man.
notthefakeSVP	710511514931896320	2016-03-17T17:02:00	ScoobyCub what's ridiculous is bringing a kid to the clubhouse every day.  No office in America would allow it.
notthefakeSVP	710510644546682880	2016-03-17T16:58:32	ScoobyCub BS.  They asked him to curtail it. It's reasonable.  Classless? That's ridiculous.
notthefakeSVP	710509919708045312	2016-03-17T16:55:40	Davisstud59 so, let's stop.  Have a good day.
notthefakeSVP	710509390831427584	2016-03-17T16:53:34	Davisstud59 professionalism? This is a discussion on Twitter where I explained, repeatedly, this isn't about Spring training.  Not tricky
notthefakeSVP	710507481525579777	2016-03-17T16:45:58	Davisstud59 NapaCowboy are you this dense? It's not about spring training.  They asked him to stop for the year. I'm done here. Bye
notthefakeSVP	710506354541273088	2016-03-17T16:41:30	Davisstud59 NapaCowboy how about Frazier, Sale, etc all want their kids to hang out every day too? Now what? It's day care?
notthefakeSVP	710505487582797825	2016-03-17T16:38:03	SamCro126 I grow weary of the lazy "ESPN" jokes. I'm in charge of me, if you've heard ME say something, let me know. Otherwise, it's lazy
notthefakeSVP	710504905262407680	2016-03-17T16:35:44	Davisstud59 NapaCowboy what's he wrong about? It's a work environment with adults. Asked him to "dial it back". I totally disagree w/you
notthefakeSVP	710503168375914497	2016-03-17T16:28:50	NapaCowboy Davisstud59 a team has the right to tell a player, you can't bring your kid to the clubhouse EVERY DAY. Period
notthefakeSVP	710501227868626944	2016-03-17T16:21:07	SamCro126 let me just put it this way: That's a corny ass, nonsensical tweet and you're wrong. Better?
notthefakeSVP	710500245541666817	2016-03-17T16:17:13	Davisstud59 he's the only one with a kid? It's unreasonable. Maybe I want to cuss and tell x rated stories and be naked.  It's MY workspace
notthefakeSVP	710499971401908228	2016-03-17T16:16:08	SamCro126 you say there, thought this up, typed it and hit send.  Probably thought you were really knocking it out of the park.  Right?
notthefakeSVP	710499683156754432	2016-03-17T16:14:59	Davisstud59 you're missing the point.  They didn't say he couldn't spend time. They just said he can't be the 26th member of team EVERY DAY
notthefakeSVP	710499338343092224	2016-03-17T16:13:37	metrosportsrept and he did what was right for him. I'm not judging him. I'm judging team and agree with their request.
notthefakeSVP	710499105538232321	2016-03-17T16:12:41	Davisstud59 no.  He didn't.   Not EVERY day.   He was around, which is great.  Not every day.
notthefakeSVP	710498828923744256	2016-03-17T16:11:35	NapaCowboy metrosportsrept they simply asked him to stop doing it every day.  It's reasonable.
notthefakeSVP	710497853471383552	2016-03-17T16:07:43	Davisstud59 he did it ALL YEAR last year.  ALL SEASON.  they just asked him to curtail. Reasonable.

notthefakeSVP	710495495840538624	2016-03-17T15:58:21	RBickham1911 I told Stuart about groups like MOP etc.   I'm not TRYING to be anything.  Man, gtfoh.

notthefakeSVP	710366783023218688	2016-03-17T07:26:53	DMinus313 you said it yourself about how he comes off. Makes no difference. Will go early and get a chance.
notthefakeSVP	710358416968048640	2016-03-17T06:53:39	DMinus313 Which is why teams wonder if that's why he wasn't the Capt. Is he a jerk? (I don't think that - but that's where it comes from)

notthefakeSVP	710343464215580672	2016-03-17T05:54:14	DMinus313 Which is fair. I know it's a question from teams. Virtually every three year qb that successful is a C. He's a pro &amp; could start
notthefakeSVP	710343151093997568	2016-03-17T05:52:59	RandysTweeter That implies anyone with a son isn't doing that by not bringing him to the clubhouse every day. Many ways to put family first
notthefakeSVP	710342186848620545	2016-03-17T05:49:09	DMinus313 My point is simply, when you say - it wasn't this, it wasn't that. A natural follow up is, then why do you think it was the case?

notthefakeSVP	697852786734731264	2016-02-11T18:40:44	AndrewSWelch attacking = laughing at something that's funny. (Him going bonkers every game). I hope he gets the florida practice. Go B1G
notthefakeSVP	697852555477565440	2016-02-11T18:39:49	AndrewSWelch that's it. I got a memo from a boss to make a joke because...sec.  It's incredible this is the reaction. It truly is.
notthefakeSVP	697852318243536901	2016-02-11T18:38:52	joecool989 I'm happy to do it. Try to help people understand how silly it is to make something totally harmless into a "thing". It's not
notthefakeSVP	697844643577360384	2016-02-11T18:08:23	joecool989 bottom line is this: I made a joke about something I found funny. The idea a boss directed me to do it is so dumb it's insane
notthefakeSVP	697843564798054401	2016-02-11T18:04:05	joecool989 you're trying too hard to be clever.  Every noon, 3:30 and prime time on the entire ESPN family of networks you see who? B1G
notthefakeSVP	697842964551200768	2016-02-11T18:01:42	joecool989 B1G is massively important to ESPN. You saw overwhelming majority of mich games on what net?
notthefakeSVP	697842782564581376	2016-02-11T18:00:59	joecool989 they own a major stake in B1G net.  ESPN shows more B1G than anyone other than the network that carries only that league.
notthefakeSVP	697839822057046017	2016-02-11T17:49:13	JMacGreenwood I didn't. Happens everywhere - the recruits. I hope he gets practice there. I'm a B1G guy. Our coach was on his staff. Relax
notthefakeSVP	697839473124515840	2016-02-11T17:47:50	DavidWatson58 where did you see overwhelming majority of Michigan games this year? Here's a hint... It starts with an E.  Then an S...
notthefakeSVP	697839256278937600	2016-02-11T17:46:58	DavidWatson58 this is so damned stupid.  It's like a beacon in the sky to dumb people.  "Say the SEC thing".
notthefakeSVP	697838924584980480	2016-02-11T17:45:39	joecool989 do you think you just made a point? Where do you see more B1G games than any net other than B1G net?  Fox owns most of it
notthefakeSVP	697817463816351744	2016-02-11T16:20:22	johnnyicon42 I think you're right. I'm in the B1G. I don't care if Jim has practice in Florida. Actually, I hope he does.

notthefakeSVP	697809042778025984	2016-02-11T15:46:55	johnnyicon42 none of you all can spell you're. Do you have any idea how important the B1G is to ESPN? No, you don't. So you say dumb sh*t.
notthefakeSVP	697808752133668864	2016-02-11T15:45:45	sully8080 I'm IN the B1G.

notthefakeSVP	682624887597432837	2015-12-31T18:10:30	GregorRossino PattyLeit I love this so much
notthefakeSVP	682613197149462534	2015-12-31T17:24:03	cmartinez521 pleasure. All the best.
notthefakeSVP	682612254240567296	2015-12-31T17:20:18	Joel_Wood haha.  I'm used to it.
notthefakeSVP	682455799050989568	2015-12-31T06:58:36	Hawkfanatic24 BPredict exactly. Which allowed their starting qb to get his nose reattached.
notthefakeSVP	682455067627253761	2015-12-31T06:55:42	BPredict there's nothing to disagree with.  You see things through a math prism exclusively. It ignores things like who is the qb.
notthefakeSVP	682454166413938688	2015-12-31T06:52:07	mike_scott88 BPredict it was simple. We trust our defense more than our back up QB. Our defense that got a stop then a pick.

notthefakeSVP	682451893856137216	2015-12-31T06:43:05	BPredict McMathketball not with your backup Qb in. Defense holds. Starter is back in.  They're in FG range and driving.
notthefakeSVP	682451260977577984	2015-12-31T06:40:34	BPredict oh. It's a football game. With nuance. Not a math test. Also, they're getting the ball back because their defense is real good.
notthefakeSVP	682450464114368512	2015-12-31T06:37:24	BPredict is everything a math equation? Or is there room for- Bart Houston is the guy we need to get us the 8 ?
