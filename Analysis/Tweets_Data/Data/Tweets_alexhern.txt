alexhern	719829903189929984	2016-04-12T10:09:57	alexhern Also worth noting in both cases, it's not original artist suing but their heirs
alexhern	719830258174849024	2016-04-12T10:11:22	chrisapplegate Yeah, that feels really telling as well.
alexhern	719830192055828481	2016-04-12T10:11:06	TrustworthyM Exactly. Don‚Äôt focus on the songs, which are only picked as targets *because* they‚Äôre successful; focus on the awful case law
alexhern	719829863495020544	2016-04-12T10:09:47	TrustworthyM Yes! They did! Because that‚Äôs how music‚Äôs evolved for hundreds of years. Criminalising it is terrifying
alexhern	719829710893682688	2016-04-12T10:09:11	TrustworthyM That is: it‚Äôs increasingly looking like the US views being *inspired* by another song as copyright infringment
alexhern	719829572175470592	2016-04-12T10:08:38	TrustworthyM but what this and Blurred Lines seem to be doing is extending that copyright culture to the concept of ‚Äúlook and feel‚Äù.
alexhern	719829467967942656	2016-04-12T10:08:13	TrustworthyM Hence ‚Äúmusic as a whole‚Äù; US copyright law has already destroyed whole genres, and I‚Äôve been tweeting about that for years‚Ä¶
alexhern	719827332647751680	2016-04-12T09:59:44	First the Blurred Lines lawsuit, now this; US copyright law is increasingly dangerous to music as a whole

alexhern	719797395635183616	2016-04-12T08:00:46	keewa mattbcooper The people who already own houses in Shoreditch would rather live next to a wasteland than have 1300 new neighbours
