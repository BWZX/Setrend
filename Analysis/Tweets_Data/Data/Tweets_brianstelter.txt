brianstelter	722831993575112704	2016-04-20T16:59:11	ShaunKing PeteThePlanner (i agree with that BTW)
brianstelter	722831662975819776	2016-04-20T16:57:52	ShaunKing lilsarg when you're in the city, let's meet up. i hope you'll see that the LAST thing i want to be is condescending.
brianstelter	722831343051091968	2016-04-20T16:56:36	DonaldMealor i typically re-read my stories for lots of reasons, not just that reason. but other ppl do it differently
brianstelter	722831248880590848	2016-04-20T16:56:13	ShaunKing got it. i really think this is about DN's editing processes. so it's helpful to understand they weren't showing you the full edit
brianstelter	722830574562377729	2016-04-20T16:53:33	PeteThePlanner ShaunKing i've heard that from others as well. i believe it
brianstelter	722829828869607424	2016-04-20T16:50:35	ShaunKing what this editor did to you is shocking. *destructive.* and i'm genuinely trying to understand how you never noticed him do it.
brianstelter	722829672237506562	2016-04-20T16:49:58	ShaunKing i read. you said you never clicked the links after publication. but what about before then? did you read the edited versions?
brianstelter	722829194804092929	2016-04-20T16:48:04	ShaunKing i respectfully disagree. i'm asking because i'm curious. i think i read all of yesterday's interviews &amp; didn't see the answer.
brianstelter	722828586441310208	2016-04-20T16:45:39	libboomer i'm not wagging anything.
brianstelter	722828395126521857	2016-04-20T16:44:53	ShaunKing to rephrase it: why didn't you catch the editor's repeatedly destructive actions? ultimately your byline = your responsibility
brianstelter	722828247738650625	2016-04-20T16:44:18	ShaunKing what i, and others, asked was this: 
brianstelter	722825069718859777	2016-04-20T16:31:40	ShaunKing I respect your work. you don't need my advice. but I think all readers deserve to understand more about the NYDN editing process
brianstelter	722824879360368640	2016-04-20T16:30:55	ShaunKing it's a sincere question because you didn't reply to anyone's inquiries about the playback issue yesterday.
brianstelter	722818783669137408	2016-04-20T16:06:42	ShaunKing NYDailyNews from now on, will you be reading all editor "playbacks" before they're published, so you see what changes are made?
