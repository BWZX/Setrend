stellacreasy	698873907084967937	2016-02-14T14:18:18	If you think that then can‚Äôt see why you are against idea our UK govt should monitor what goes on‚Ä¶ 
stellacreasy	698873671859990532	2016-02-14T14:17:22	No PM told me airlines not ‚Äòmandated‚Äô to do what US officials say- just adds to need for scrutiny of this‚Ä¶ 
stellacreasy	698873335824969728	2016-02-14T14:16:02	Suddenly the libertarians click - we have no idea what they are doing and if effective according to PM‚Ä¶ 
stellacreasy	698873148092108800	2016-02-14T14:15:17	Ah you mean you haven‚Äôt read the report ‚Ä¶PM clear airlines not mandated to follow US officials decisions‚Ä¶ 
stellacreasy	698872866260045824	2016-02-14T14:14:10	Well even a rocket scientist might want some data - odd to be against our govt being held to account‚Ä¶ 
stellacreasy	698872569315860480	2016-02-14T14:12:59	Did anyone suggest security checks shouldn‚Äôt occur -aren‚Äôt you worried PM says airlines don‚Äôt have to comply?!  
stellacreasy	698872324171366400	2016-02-14T14:12:01	Do you know what‚Äôs happening at our airports? I don‚Äôt but I expect our security services to be told? Don‚Äôt you?  
stellacreasy	698872096500404224	2016-02-14T14:11:06	So how do you know that‚Äôs what they are doing? Point is we don‚Äôt know anything about what happening at mo‚Ä¶ 
stellacreasy	698871709630382080	2016-02-14T14:09:34	Really? Do explain why expecting our govt to know what happens at our airports is supporting terrorism‚Ä¶
