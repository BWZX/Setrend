danshep55	724007383089963008	2016-04-23T22:49:46	BuckeyeTrader87 only advantage heavyweight will be smaller group &amp; means less rounds . Could be 4 fights compared to 8 at middleweight
danshep55	724007007301316609	2016-04-23T22:48:16	BuckeyeTrader87 middle weight is 66 pounds .  He is 67 now . So if he gets 66 he is heaviest middle weight compared to lightest heavyweight
danshep55	724006153093570561	2016-04-23T22:44:52	BuckeyeTrader87 will see how he does at heavy weight . Might be a challenge . But might as well try before nationals
