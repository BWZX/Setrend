bluechoochoo	719918663449509889	2016-04-12T16:02:39	A facebook f8 video livestream, my lord? It's not for another hour. But if it pleases you, my lord, the URL: 
bluechoochoo	719914853326921728	2016-04-12T15:47:31	IceManNYR Totally agree. I don't have regular TV, and I do fine online. But it'll be so cool to have it in  options.
bluechoochoo	719912116069609472	2016-04-12T15:36:38	IceManNYR I think it was exactly that reason- part of carriage deal. It was live up until second AJAM went on air.
bluechoochoo	719907719876988929	2016-04-12T15:19:10	alexweprin brianstelter Many networks think/thought online strategy is having periscope/snapchat TOTALLY UNRELATED to primary programming.
bluechoochoo	719906572067942401	2016-04-12T15:14:36	alexweprin brianstelter  Word. I remember Fusion (same time-frame) was using "mobile first," etc rhetoric. But still went cable first(!)
bluechoochoo	719905833551663104	2016-04-12T15:11:40	brianstelter alexweprin I'm cord-never who eagerly awaited launch of AJAM + Fusion online.* So many of us were/are ready to watch ONLINE.

bluechoochoo	719904620286312448	2016-04-12T15:06:51	alexweprin And yet... Fusion knows their soft power is online. Respect to BloombergTV for seeing this way ahead.
bluechoochoo	719903600479117312	2016-04-12T15:02:48	alexweprin They decided it was worth it to dance with the carriage devil. AJPlus is them correcting that mistake.
bluechoochoo	719903123809021952	2016-04-12T15:00:54	AJAM said, "nope!" to publishing online, where similar content (vicenews documentaries, ajplus) does great.

bluechoochoo	719622604840050688	2016-04-11T20:26:13	alexweprin Heh. I follow jonsteinberg school of thought that (TV) "news" often simply ambient live stimulation.
bluechoochoo	719622055054868481	2016-04-11T20:24:02	alexweprin (though as that second (cum) number continues to soar, it's more like a VOD thing than nielsen-ish rating.)
bluechoochoo	719621904076681217	2016-04-11T20:23:26	alexweprin Right. But I watched whole thing. It was floating high throughout. It was sitting in millions (cum) immediately upon completion.
bluechoochoo	719620905094086656	2016-04-11T20:19:28	alexweprin So... competitive. I look at all cable news ratings in tvnewser's scribd archive, it's even more competitive.

bluechoochoo	719220199065460736	2016-04-10T17:47:12	mrdrozdov Hm. I think it's like inflation. So no liquidity/credit crisis (like a bank run would have), but less value.

bluechoochoo	718112302965219328	2016-04-07T16:24:49	For example, bloomberg is OTT news:  (available on roku, appletv, amazon, etc) TYBBBG. Thank you, based Bloomberg.
bluechoochoo	718111659282137088	2016-04-07T16:22:16	tmcmill81 Yeah. Complicated. Article points out that on consumption side, those "old friends" posts do great. Just fewer are made.
bluechoochoo	718110612149051392	2016-04-07T16:18:06	OTT not the opposite of news. One is a distribution style. One is a content type.
bluechoochoo	718110252692967425	2016-04-07T16:16:40	THAToneil That's open to interpretation, but I see it as separate issue. Shares of links to news less of a crisis (according to article).
bluechoochoo	718105147822333952	2016-04-07T15:56:23	AnthroPunk zeynep Some are invested in that narrative. But many who repeated  it were topical/news types who just didn't look closely.
bluechoochoo	718103428958855173	2016-04-07T15:49:33	PrivacyMatters zeynep I apologized for that in my next tweet. If you search the URL in twitter search, you can hunt for a "free" share.
bluechoochoo	718102673141014528	2016-04-07T15:46:33	zeynep In addition to FB's switcheroos, they hold other scary stuff over its users- way more personal info/ID check, etc.
bluechoochoo	718102357318324224	2016-04-07T15:45:18	zeynep You're totally right. Way more changing mechanisms after the fact w/FB. My only point: there's always intimacy decay.
bluechoochoo	718101823639257091	2016-04-07T15:43:11	zeynep Me too. But we've also seen early days of Instagram, Twitter, Vine, and even Snapchat feel more intimate, then move to Stunting. :D
bluechoochoo	718101018894970884	2016-04-07T15:39:59	eliasguerra For sure. Article somewhat suggests this (also shift to FB's own Messenger), but w/less data than main sharing decline stuff.
bluechoochoo	718100694536859648	2016-04-07T15:38:41	zeynep Completely agree with your whole thread. But also see an "intimacy -&gt; performance" path for most platforms.
bluechoochoo	718099073748705280	2016-04-07T15:32:15	Even Facebook's own employees say people visit mostly not looking for anything in particular. Just like TV, there's channel surfing vs appt.
bluechoochoo	718098738229587968	2016-04-07T15:30:55	Yesterday I had tweetstorm about youtube vs FB Video. Youtube better for "intent," Facebook better for "indiscriminate" attention.
bluechoochoo	718097387172925441	2016-04-07T15:25:33	mjbarash Oh totally. And article points out Messenger not monetized. :D  But if you're trying to figure out, "where is everybody," useful.
bluechoochoo	718096725320138752	2016-04-07T15:22:55	mjbarash In the article, they said a lot of stuff is popping in Messenger, whose contents are harder to parse. Maybe sharing there.
bluechoochoo	718096410369888256	2016-04-07T15:21:40	This isn't necessarily bad for anybody, especially marketers. But article (sorry, it's reg-only) suggests it's viewed as problem internally.
bluechoochoo	718096046270709760	2016-04-07T15:20:13	All that time on Facebook spent lurking, consuming. Not sharing.  (Personal shares way down)

bluechoochoo	709835021461291008	2016-03-15T20:13:51	Chronotope In each of our examples, we might be using "quality" as proxy for *custom.* And that's really what I mean by "format."
bluechoochoo	709834816137482240	2016-03-15T20:13:02	Chronotope In this thought experiment, I'd say the could use Medium/Tumblr. Tech quality would be great. (But formatting bad.)

bluechoochoo	709833560148938752	2016-03-15T20:08:03	Chronotope Hm. I can see "experience" being big bucket with both, I guess. But I also can put any single thing in that bucket. Like price.

bluechoochoo	709832628891832320	2016-03-15T20:04:21	ManiGandham Format + perf are opposed (currently). I mean it's why AMP + FB Instant feel so "fast," but look so same-same. (and RSS, etc)
bluechoochoo	709832121511055360	2016-03-15T20:02:20	Chronotope General. Like we can say that business + quality are equal. But I think for this thought experiment, it wouldn't matter.

bluechoochoo	700059619310194688	2016-02-17T20:49:54	aexm Exactly! That's what I mean by "flat account space." An account has to be an account has to be an account for big social serendipity.

bluechoochoo	696180400872247296	2016-02-07T03:55:16	GretchenAMcC valeriecodes coz stuff can't spread? Makes sense.  My current model for FB communications: a million mostly isolated lagoons.
bluechoochoo	696177284135329792	2016-02-07T03:42:53	GretchenAMcC I laughed.
bluechoochoo	696177089490194432	2016-02-07T03:42:07	valeriecodes GretchenAMcC btw, I wrote about IG's lack of regram/discovery vectors + how news can't spread there: 
bluechoochoo	696176774984519680	2016-02-07T03:40:52	valeriecodes GretchenAMcC Agree IG has too few discovery vectors than, say, Twitter. Still easier than SC, which has no sharable URLs.
bluechoochoo	696176699822600192	2016-02-07T03:40:34	GretchenAMcC Yes. I feel this is decaying though, just coz IG used to feel intimate, and many other places, too. I follow too many hams. :D
bluechoochoo	696175917849182208	2016-02-07T03:37:27	GretchenAMcC I agree with your theory. We've all seen the difference in how performative the (public) Stories are compared w/the Messages.
bluechoochoo	696174995760779264	2016-02-07T03:33:47	GretchenAMcC It's not an official term or anything, but I call this "discovery vector," and yeah, snapchat has like, half of one.
bluechoochoo	696173793786466304	2016-02-07T03:29:01	GretchenAMcC (I gotta add coz it's often overlooked, Tumblr's similar social gestures/network design make community easy there, too.)
bluechoochoo	696173208089681920	2016-02-07T03:26:41	GretchenAMcC On Twitter, we can all ask our faves to Come to Brazil. It's beautiful thing.
bluechoochoo	696172547541340161	2016-02-07T03:24:04	GretchenAMcC (And we still can't search FB + see who's sharing URL, talking to favorite artist, etc... makes fandom way easier on Twitter.)
bluechoochoo	696172287435755520	2016-02-07T03:23:02	GretchenAMcC Compounding: Facebook's huge volume of public posts was not searchable until October '15. Even now, mentions not searchable.
