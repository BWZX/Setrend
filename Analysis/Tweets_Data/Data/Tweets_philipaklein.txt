philipaklein	708808184237051906	2016-03-13T00:13:34	Trump would need 15% of the DC vote to get at least one  delegate. Anecdotally, Rubio, Kasich, Cruz presence seemed stronger to me.

philipaklein	707215096645230592	2016-03-08T14:43:13	When it comes to netting out Michigan delegates tonight, it'll look something like 22-20-17. In other words, no momentum shift.
philipaklein	707337135695773696	2016-03-08T22:48:09	Look at Western Michigan &amp; Macomb County tonight. West MI is the most conservative part of the state &amp; could be early an bellwether.

philipaklein	707269668969553921	2016-03-08T18:20:04	Cruz nomination in contested convention would likely be less divisive than, say, installing Rubio, Romney, Ryan, etc 
philipaklein	707269111349436417	2016-03-08T18:17:51	Nominating Trump says: We are the party of authoritarianism, entitlements, protectionism, &amp; white male resentment 
philipaklein	707268781601636352	2016-03-08T18:16:32	At this pt, whoever the nom, some ppl will be angry. So denying Trump would be taking stand abt what GOP stands for 
philipaklein	707268508036505600	2016-03-08T18:15:27	Talk about cost of denying Trump must be considered in NET terms -- weighed against cost of nominating him 
philipaklein	707268196940845056	2016-03-08T18:14:13	Denying Trump nom during convention wouldn't break GOP. It's already broken. This is now a triage operation

philipaklein	707222282607960064	2016-03-08T15:11:46	I also, re EWErickson think that degree matters too. Trump at 1236 delegates, different than 950, with late losing streak.
philipaklein	707221465658236928	2016-03-08T15:08:31	Also re: EWErickson if Trump is the nominee, there will be mass exodus to 3rd party. So either way, it's civil war.
philipaklein	707221335894839297	2016-03-08T15:08:00	Disagree w/ EWErickson here. GOP shouldn't consider threat of violence from Trump supporters in picking nominee 
philipaklein	707219771838873604	2016-03-08T15:01:47	CNN has so much Trump on the brain they're starting to spell like him too

philipaklein	706964757396508672	2016-03-07T22:08:27	Why would Bloomberg need to run when GOP is about to nominate a pro-gun control NY billionaire anyway?
philipaklein	706959492349612033	2016-03-07T21:47:32	If only this election weren't presaging the collapse of the republic, it would be the greatest ever.  
philipaklein	706949763938316288	2016-03-07T21:08:52	jasonahart seanmdav I don't envy you though!
philipaklein	706949671537811457	2016-03-07T21:08:30	jasonahart seanmdav Yes, just a lot better chance an OH win helps Trump get nom than Kasich, who is cooked either way.
philipaklein	706949334609371139	2016-03-07T21:07:10	jasonahart seanmdav If I were in OH at this pt, I'd vote Kasich strategically. Risk of this propelling him to nom, smaller than Trump.
philipaklein	706949032984383488	2016-03-07T21:05:58	jpodhoretz per poll,  Trump has a 42% to 26% lead among those who have yet to vote.
philipaklein	706948409329061889	2016-03-07T21:03:29	jpodhoretz That's what it says. But poll was of 400 people. And 1/5 early voters. So that subsample is like 80 people.
philipaklein	706948177279262720	2016-03-07T21:02:34	jasonahart seanmdav So your NeverKasich position stronger than NeverTrump
philipaklein	706946977649524740	2016-03-07T20:57:48	jasonahart So will you strategically vote for Kasich?
philipaklein	706942684041183232	2016-03-07T20:40:44	EmilyMiller DCGOP patmara Yes, it's a convention.
philipaklein	706939959584882689	2016-03-07T20:29:55	You'd also expect this to be accompanied by Kasich consolidating that vote in Ohio.

philipaklein	706919133888299008	2016-03-07T19:07:10	A good reason for Rubio not to drop out 
philipaklein	706915124750192640	2016-03-07T18:51:14	How many rallies is seanhannity gonna have for Trump disguised as interviews?  
philipaklein	706894566457221120	2016-03-07T17:29:32	Kasich is closer to Rubio in the delegate count than Rubio is to Cruz 
philipaklein	706894293236060161	2016-03-07T17:28:27	If it weren't for early voting, Rubio would be facing much heavier pressure to drop out before Florida &amp; endorse Cruz.

philipaklein	706666607007961090	2016-03-07T02:23:42	seanmdav IL will be interesting bc it's allocation rules allow candidates to target different areas, picking off delegates
philipaklein	706665960829227009	2016-03-07T02:21:08	seanmdav me either. But obv also depends on what happens this TUE and in IL
philipaklein	706664057206611969	2016-03-07T02:13:35	seanmdav otherwise kasich and rubio stay to convention and contested con becomes more likely
philipaklein	706663889157668864	2016-03-07T02:12:55	seanmdav it's not just the delegates but the states that are WTA. Trump wins OH &amp; FL, and it bc a two-man race, somebody likely gets 1237

philipaklein	706594614959067137	2016-03-06T21:37:38	Trump will have only won 53 of the 178 delegates up for grabs this weekend -- or under 30%. Not what inevitability looks like.

philipaklein	703059590339026945	2016-02-26T03:30:43	Trump insults Cruz and Rubio, so guess what Wolf Blitzer did? Just guess. Yep. That's right. He kicked it over to John Kasich.

philipaklein	703056874015473664	2016-02-26T03:19:55	Best thing Rubio has done is to belittle Trump, undercutting him when he tries to apply his “dealmaking” to everything. Exposing ignorance.
philipaklein	703056114842259457	2016-02-26T03:16:54	Ted Cruz &amp; Rubio demonstrate moral clarity on Israel, Trump adopts false moral equivalence.

philipaklein	703053537983537152	2016-02-26T03:06:40	Imagine an alternate universe in which all GOP candidates went after Trump like this months ago.
philipaklein	703052961510002688	2016-02-26T03:04:22	With multiple people going hard at Trump, he doesn’t look so good. It becomes clear that he has only two or three stock answers.
philipaklein	703052701001768960	2016-02-26T03:03:20	And here comes Cruz’s ripping apart Trump.
philipaklein	703051183095676928	2016-02-26T02:57:18	I guess Trump goes on Hewitt’s radio show out of charity since no one listens to it.
philipaklein	703050758925721601	2016-02-26T02:55:37	Trump: “You don’t learn anything about peoples’ wealth from a tax return”. Except how much income they’re earning on that wealth.
philipaklein	703049840301838336	2016-02-26T02:51:58	Trump says he’ll balance the budget by getting rid of “waste, fraud, and abuse” — what a non-politician answer!
philipaklein	703049253518704640	2016-02-26T02:49:38	Wolf Blitzer needs to shut the hell up and let the actual candidates debate.
philipaklein	703049198539841536	2016-02-26T02:49:25	Trump just blatantly lied.He said on 60 minutes "Everybody's got to be covered...The government's gonna pay for it.” 
philipaklein	703045892887048193	2016-02-26T02:36:17	This is what happens when you have a preexisting conditions requirement with no individual mandate - a death spiral: 
philipaklein	703047513436241922	2016-02-26T02:42:43	Trump tries to get back on game by making fun of Rubio for repeating himself. By repeating himself. B/c he’s forgotten his own talking point
philipaklein	703047812666281984	2016-02-26T02:43:55	That Rubio v Trump healthcare exchange was my favorite part of this primary season. By far.

philipaklein	703046086110404609	2016-02-26T02:37:03	Trump is just throwing out random phrases on healthcare. He has no idea what he’s talking about.
philipaklein	703045830807298048	2016-02-26T02:36:02	Trump is talking all nonsense, about getting rid of the lines. That was never up for debate during Ocare.
philipaklein	703045665266507776	2016-02-26T02:35:23	Trump said, “I want to keep pre-existing conditions.”

philipaklein	703042915220787200	2016-02-26T02:24:27	Why didn’t Cruz take the opportunity to hit Trump on judges? He was wide open.

philipaklein	703037805040107520	2016-02-26T02:04:09	Wolf Blitzer has his next really tough question ready for Trump to filibuster: how are you going to make America great again?
philipaklein	703036379056480256	2016-02-26T01:58:29	Oh, yes, by all means let's let John Kasich talk and interrupt the Rubio-Cruz tag team on Trump. Top notch work there, Wolf.
philipaklein	703036383812829184	2016-02-26T01:58:30	Dammit WOlf, Trump just attacked Cruz but you didn't let Cruz respond. Terrible moderating
