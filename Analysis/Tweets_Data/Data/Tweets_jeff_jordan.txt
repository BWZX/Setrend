jeff_jordan	702907075685326850	2016-02-25T17:24:40	KamalKarmakar I agree with that as well.  But retailers need to offset increasing digital costs by lowering store costs (shutting stores)

jeff_jordan	701977028308799488	2016-02-23T03:49:00	DonaldRichard Yup. Retailers keep all their store costs + invest heavily on digital. Problematic if total sales don't grow..and most don't.
