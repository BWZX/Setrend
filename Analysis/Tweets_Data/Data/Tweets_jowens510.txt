jowens510	725746795087843334	2016-04-28T18:01:34	Silicon Valley came to be because Rodgers, Zinn and hundreds of others believed in the power of semiconductors and human capability.
jowens510	725746398512201734	2016-04-28T17:59:59	The awesome heathersomervil wrote about Zinn's departure last year for mercnews:

jowens510	725745697572708353	2016-04-28T17:57:12	TJ Rodgers' departure is part of the demise of a whole generation of Silicon Valley pioneers, many of them in the chip sector.

jowens510	725744561075675137	2016-04-28T17:52:41	paxdickinson Personally, I love the "I got rich off saving SunPower, but screw the federal subsidies that are doing it" thing.
jowens510	725743953476243456	2016-04-28T17:50:16	It would be hard for such a character to make it without being ripped apart today, but Silicon Valley is richer for his service.
jowens510	725743743912038401	2016-04-28T17:49:26	Rodgers is an outspoken libertarian who commonly went against conventional wisdom and prevailing Silicon Valley opinion.
jowens510	725743313865834496	2016-04-28T17:47:44	paxdickinson Personally, I would put "Talked shit to a nun about political correctness" at roughly 842,659 on list of TJ stuff to remember
jowens510	725742319975174145	2016-04-28T17:43:47	Of course, TJ being TJ, he also took time to rail against federal subsidies for solar power, even while SunPower was profiting.
jowens510	725741578296373248	2016-04-28T17:40:50	When SunPower was about to go under, Rodgers poured money in. Cypress ended up owning a majority of the eventual solar energy powerhouse.
jowens510	725740876929089536	2016-04-28T17:38:03	For those who don't know, Rodgers founded Cypress in 1982 and has run the company since, longest-running active Valley CEO I can think of.
jowens510	725740563178336256	2016-04-28T17:36:48	Wow, just saw that TJ Rodgers is stepping down from Cypress. A true Silicon Valley legend who will be missed.
