BenedictEvans	711877315194712065	2016-03-21T11:29:12	One of the more gobsmacking quotes I've read in a while:   
BenedictEvans	711988330842292225	2016-03-21T18:50:20	Apple used to be like BMW selling you an old-model 5-Series at a discount. Now it has an actual 3-series for that price point
BenedictEvans	711987964876730372	2016-03-21T18:48:53	imawickedlemon largest sales ever
BenedictEvans	711987888401985537	2016-03-21T18:48:35	Shifting the release of the SE to 6 months after the larger model is a way to reduce cannibalisation. Also smooths out the supply chain.
BenedictEvans	711987541847638016	2016-03-21T18:47:12	Harsh ;)  
BenedictEvans	711986656329355264	2016-03-21T18:43:41	Another way to look at this: Apple now has a 4" flagship iPhone for $400. Hello Samsung.
BenedictEvans	711986288690221056	2016-03-21T18:42:13	ochnew no. There is some data on the install-base mix but you have to guess about second-hand

BenedictEvans	711985621590343680	2016-03-21T18:39:34	Side-note: you can buy a 3G Android phone for $30 wholesale now.
BenedictEvans	711985233432678400	2016-03-21T18:38:02	Wondering if any of Apple's slowing iPhone unit growth was due to declining sales of older models due to positioning / competition
BenedictEvans	711984886324703232	2016-03-21T18:36:39	DrPizza maxrogo not in any of the talking points, not on the website marketing materials either. no mention of 'best ever price'
BenedictEvans	711984582560616448	2016-03-21T18:35:27	maxrogo zero mention of price in the event or marketing
BenedictEvans	711984247020457984	2016-03-21T18:34:07	And given it looks like the SE is using mostly current components, the margin implications will be the first question on the quarterly call
BenedictEvans	711984078182977537	2016-03-21T18:33:26	So, Apple is having a new run at the mid-range smartphone market, with a new strategy, and potentially could do much better.
BenedictEvans	711983602527907842	2016-03-21T18:31:33	So now Apple comes back with a high-spec phone at a mid-range price but doesn't mention price - all the positioning is 'the best 4" phone'
BenedictEvans	711983148058304516	2016-03-21T18:29:45	The 5C sold roughly the same as the 'older models' strategy - OK, not great. Positioned as 'a bit cheaper, fun colours'
BenedictEvans	711982794260361216	2016-03-21T18:28:20	Before, Apple's mid-range strategy was older models. But actually, the ~$400 model didn't really sell - just 13% of units last year.
BenedictEvans	711981327159926784	2016-03-21T18:22:31	Urvaksh It's cheaper.
BenedictEvans	711980960242278400	2016-03-21T18:21:03	The iPad Pro has around 1000x more transistors than a Pentium, designed by Apple's in-house chip team, but it 'can't do anything new'. Sigh.
BenedictEvans	711980690326196224	2016-03-21T18:19:59	Urvaksh it's the lower-end model
BenedictEvans	711980394774573057	2016-03-21T18:18:48	So what's Apple's line-up next year? iPhone 7, 6s and a new SE?
BenedictEvans	711979725715935232	2016-03-21T18:16:09	Interesting that the iPhone SE has a better camera than the more expensive 6 
BenedictEvans	711978006022066176	2016-03-21T18:09:19	The Apple SIM is now “embedded” in the new iPad Pro.
BenedictEvans	711977516865441792	2016-03-21T18:07:22	You have to appreciate how many techies are out of touch with how normal consumers use PCs.. Good thing Apple isn’t.

BenedictEvans	711975208425422849	2016-03-21T17:58:12	Please tell me this is getting cleaned up 
BenedictEvans	711974382533345282	2016-03-21T17:54:55	An iPad Pro CPU has 'more than 3bn' transistors. The original Pentium for 1995 had 3.1 million. Not a perfect comparison, but relevant.
BenedictEvans	711973063030538244	2016-03-21T17:49:40	Apple's iPad line-up has been a bit of a mess lately. Could anyone really say what combination of large and mini iPads are on sale today?
BenedictEvans	711972522128834560	2016-03-21T17:47:31	200m 9.7" iPads sold - out of 308m total.

BenedictEvans	711970536415363072	2016-03-21T17:39:38	$400 for a 4" 'smaller' iPhone with pretty-much current specs instead of 2-year-old specs. Interesting. Pull demand up from mid-range
BenedictEvans	711969812159725570	2016-03-21T17:36:45	New smaller cheaper iPhone with similar performance, camera, better battery life. No more 2-year-old specs
BenedictEvans	711969207622041602	2016-03-21T17:34:21	Apple sold 231.5m iPhones in 2015 - now we hear just 30m of those were the cheap 4" older model. So, not much of a presence in the mid-range
