MiaChupacabra	692481987295232000	2016-01-27T22:59:06	TheBondFreak It is the same as happens with all immigrant groups.
MiaChupacabra	692481774149042176	2016-01-27T22:58:15	TheBondFreak A small minority definitely is. The overwhelming majority wants to get on and integrate
MiaChupacabra	692480539798958080	2016-01-27T22:53:21	pde62 No, it has nothing to do with treaties. Those are specific regulations attached to USC Title 26 JolyonMaugham
MiaChupacabra	692479958829109248	2016-01-27T22:51:02	JolyonMaugham Just imagine a director trying to defend a decision of paying more tax than legally required, and in a non-US jurisdiction
MiaChupacabra	692479439104524289	2016-01-27T22:48:58	JolyonMaugham It really isnt. Boards getting fired for all sorts of poor economic decisions, not only for breach of statutory duties
MiaChupacabra	692478618845495296	2016-01-27T22:45:43	pde62 American directors have duty to act for 1/ best interest of their shareholders 2/ US national interest. Pay UK tax satisfies neither
MiaChupacabra	692477787001716737	2016-01-27T22:42:24	JolyonMaugham Pls review the exchange. At no point did I suggest such a duty existed.
MiaChupacabra	692475489663979526	2016-01-27T22:33:16	JolyonMaugham 2/ of course there is no such law. There is also no definition of "abusive" tax panning, esp'ally as it applies to non US tax
MiaChupacabra	692475053846454272	2016-01-27T22:31:33	JolyonMaugham 1/ Completely missing the point. Boards that fail to maximize profits to shareholders get fired
MiaChupacabra	692473460656881664	2016-01-27T22:25:13	JolyonMaugham A board that would pay 'voluntary' taxes overseas would at best get immediately fired, at worst sued into the middle ages 2/
MiaChupacabra	692473135682207745	2016-01-27T22:23:55	JolyonMaugham btw, the US tax code requires US corps to minimize overseas taxes to claim them as deductions of US corporate taxes 1/
MiaChupacabra	692472697805213696	2016-01-27T22:22:11	JolyonMaugham Your right. But argument that any American director would ever feel moral duty to pay tax, especially overseas, is plain daft
MiaChupacabra	692470200386584576	2016-01-27T22:12:15	JolyonMaugham 2/ even if GOOG has these revenues from UK source, it does not create any 'moral' obligation to pay taxes there.
MiaChupacabra	692469954113855491	2016-01-27T22:11:17	JolyonMaugham 1/ $100m is a lunch tab for GOOG, not serious R&amp;D. Original program development ($BNs of R&amp;D) is performed in California
MiaChupacabra	692469158303436800	2016-01-27T22:08:07	JolyonMaugham 2/ even assuming profits originated in UK, up to UK to legislate to tax them. We have no 'moral' obligation to pay tax there
MiaChupacabra	692468229911003137	2016-01-27T22:04:26	JolyonMaugham 1/ the profits are generated through proprietary technologies and systems developed in Northern California, not the UK
MiaChupacabra	692465964735139843	2016-01-27T21:55:26	JolyonMaugham Any $ paid in tax overseas is a $ less for US shareholders and/or taxpayers. It is our national interest to minimize those
MiaChupacabra	692465205234765825	2016-01-27T21:52:24	JolyonMaugham These r US corps; founded, owned, managed, financed by Americans. As shareholder and US taxpayer, they owe nothing to the UK

MiaChupacabra	685089131467268096	2016-01-07T13:22:31	DougKass DK, every post-WWII recession in US was preceded by i) rising energy/commodity prices, ii) periods of high real interest rates 1/2
