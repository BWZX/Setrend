jkottke	678293105607622656	2015-12-19T19:17:33	djacobs Def was Leia. But maybe Obi-Wan didn't assume that she was Force sensitive? But Yoda sensed it?
jkottke	678283008537985025	2015-12-19T18:37:25	djacobs Because Force sensitivity isn't always passed down? (Or Yoda was talking about you-know-who from VII?)
