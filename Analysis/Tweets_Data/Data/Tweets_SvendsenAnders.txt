SvendsenAnders	723122754971561985	2016-04-21T12:14:34	WorthWray Ah yeah, you mean weaker CNY vs USD leads to another round of capital outflows?
SvendsenAnders	723122307204415489	2016-04-21T12:12:47	WorthWray True, but with the basket focus China has the potential to partly detach  Asia from USD moves, I guess
SvendsenAnders	723121032249282561	2016-04-21T12:07:43	WorthWray To me it would more be an unchanged CNY in trade weighted terms despite a stronger USD.

SvendsenAnders	723113502043312129	2016-04-21T11:37:48	WorthWray Do you think China will start following the basket rather than the USD, if the USD actually starts appreciating?
SvendsenAnders	723112701900128258	2016-04-21T11:34:37	WorthWray I think commodity prices r more important atm. If the USD strengthens modestly while commodity price rise, I don't c a big issue
