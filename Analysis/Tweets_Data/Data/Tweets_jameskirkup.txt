jameskirkup	719268363671859202	2016-04-10T20:58:35	ss80014 per se, nothing.  My point is that many who do so aren't paid more. So Drs need to make better case for w/end premium.
jameskirkup	719264719656390656	2016-04-10T20:44:07	mancunianmedic to clarify, you don't support the BMA position on industrial action?
jameskirkup	719261621248503808	2016-04-10T20:31:48	mancunianmedic if you don't support a w/end pay premium, can you support a strike called over a demand for a higher Saturday premium?
jameskirkup	719257919993356288	2016-04-10T20:17:05	mancunianmedic genuine question: why do you think Drs should get weekend premium pay when others don't?
jameskirkup	719243950608007170	2016-04-10T19:21:35	mancunianmedic At least be honest: say clearly you think you're more deserving than most other people who also work antisocial w/end hours
jameskirkup	719243363548073984	2016-04-10T19:19:15	mancunianmedic Didn't say you don't work w/ends. But strikes bcos govt wdnt pay even more for Saturdays. Many others get no w/end premium.

jameskirkup	697451625653338114	2016-02-10T16:06:40	Dr_JSA Short answer: political choices. Discretionary fiscal policy = spending constraint. Refusal to consider alt NHS funding model also.
