mg	721137708001656832	2016-04-16T00:46:42	MattPRD Sure, no problem.
mg	720617846628220929	2016-04-14T14:20:57	mattermarkdaily thanks for the mention! FYI this is my Twitter, not mattgalligan
mg	720000042061266944	2016-04-12T21:26:01	basche42 One can only hope. I love iMessage and would LOVE to see it advance.
mg	719998091873505280	2016-04-12T21:18:16	I want a chatbot for TheWirecutter on Messenger right now. It would be *so* freaking handy.
mg	719997920834035712	2016-04-12T21:17:35	scottbelsky Though there may be emerging opportunities for thewirecutter esque experiences through messaging.
mg	719997690436657152	2016-04-12T21:16:40	scottbelsky Couldn't agree more. Travel, event and movie ticketing, basically task-oriented stuff will do well.
mg	719997062293508096	2016-04-12T21:14:11	Soengle messenger Totally agree. Obviously time will tell, but I'm definitely long on this one.
mg	719984425535049728	2016-04-12T20:23:58	Excited that MessageKit launched today (). Except it was Facebook with Messenger, not Apple: 
mg	719983912152223744	2016-04-12T20:21:55	Expanding on my earlier tweet on how we might distinguish bots, here's some deeper thinking on the subject:

mg	719934092683313152	2016-04-12T17:03:58	dannyjespinoza tomcoates Not sure I see that as an issue but rather an opportunity.
mg	719916276026454016	2016-04-12T15:53:10	tomcoates bot is generic and that's just fine, doesn't need more definition. But clarifying the types of bots would help. üòÅ
mg	719916031641128960	2016-04-12T15:52:11	tedr agreed but I dislike how we say "human." Perhaps "person."
mg	719915885239009280	2016-04-12T15:51:37	convjournalism askluka totally. "Person-assisted bots"
mg	719907972025966592	2016-04-12T15:20:10	Bots are all the rage these days but we need more clarifying language, not all are equal. Thoughts on "scripted bots" vs. "AI bots?"
mg	719622853402886144	2016-04-11T20:27:12	which_might I don't think those things are mutually exclusive. I also don't think they need to be in separate interfaces.
mg	719617362970849280	2016-04-11T20:05:23	Open-ended deep learning AI is not all bots. Bots with narrow focus will win big until AI is ready.
