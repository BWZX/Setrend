devintstewart	725682458738446336	2016-04-28T13:45:55	Noahpinion which one? NIRP? Since monetary policy is a lot about signaling, NIRP seems like a failure and net negative.
devintstewart	725681394702278657	2016-04-28T13:41:41	Noahpinion that was a separate thought. I agree with Stiglitz: Marginal tinkering based on outdated models: 
devintstewart	725680755872026625	2016-04-28T13:39:09	Noahpinion economic history tells me that monetary stimulus is limited and short term, not bad per se. NIRP seems silly.
