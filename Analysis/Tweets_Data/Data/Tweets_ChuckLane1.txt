ChuckLane1	718170233563910148	2016-04-07T20:15:01	Has Bern read Panama Papers? "Number of incorporations of offshore entities has been in decline for the past four years." FTA is 4 yrs old.

ChuckLane1	718167115950342146	2016-04-07T20:02:37	It would appear Obama's tax transparency side deal w/Panama has been much more effective than FTA critics like Sanders said (1)

ChuckLane1	705584427418656768	2016-03-04T02:43:31	So, after 8 months of inflaming America over issue of immigration, tonight realDonaldTrump says, essentially, "never mind."
ChuckLane1	705584029526056960	2016-03-04T02:41:56	Hold on. realDonaldTrump is "softening" his position on importing talented immigrants... WTF?

ChuckLane1	705583244385894401	2016-03-04T02:38:49	Trump has actually given a lot of ground tonight on immigration. Has he noticed that polls say its not that imp to voters?

ChuckLane1	705582158241472513	2016-03-04T02:34:30	Wow. So Trump really did tell the New York Times that his whole campaign is bullshit.
ChuckLane1	705582294153695232	2016-03-04T02:35:02	Suddenly, Trump is Mr. Give And Take...
ChuckLane1	705582095783952384	2016-03-04T02:34:15	I don’t think realDonaldTrump knows how off the record works. If the pol is off the record, then he decides what’s quotable.
ChuckLane1	705582041983795200	2016-03-04T02:34:02	Uh, oh: realDonaldTrump just referred to tug and pull and flexibility on immigration...

ChuckLane1	697987253579157505	2016-02-12T03:35:03	Let me just say this: Bern says "let me just say this" a lot.
ChuckLane1	697985311465340928	2016-02-12T03:27:20	Henry Kissinger should donate $27 to see if the check comes back.

ChuckLane1	697980754895237120	2016-02-12T03:09:14	A real test for fact-checking industry tomorrow will be following up on Bern's wild promise to empty the prisons.
ChuckLane1	697980549902831616	2016-02-12T03:08:25	Y'know, some Wall St types (&amp; others) do give money to pols just for fun, in sense that they just love the access it buys to pol celebs
ChuckLane1	697980061056692224	2016-02-12T03:06:29	Fair. Which is why I specified "has been." 
ChuckLane1	697979726527332352	2016-02-12T03:05:09	Look how HillaryClinton has turned The Bern's campaign finance rhetoric into a standing up for Barack point!
ChuckLane1	697979286880444421	2016-02-12T03:03:24	This 
ChuckLane1	697979218714615808	2016-02-12T03:03:08	After that HillaryClinton wind, Bern just says "system's corrupt" -- and wins the point cuz direct, expressive language always wins
ChuckLane1	697978255245242368	2016-02-12T02:59:18	No way they were going to let Bush and Rove put that feather in their caps. 
ChuckLane1	697978044678545408	2016-02-12T02:58:28	Yup. And this is why a) it doesn't matter when his facts are screwy and b) he's doing so well vs HillaryClinton 
ChuckLane1	697977859617509376	2016-02-12T02:57:44	Contrary to Bern's dire imagery, poverty rate among seniors is 10 percent, lower than that of general population
ChuckLane1	697977294225350656	2016-02-12T02:55:29	If anyone cares, HillaryClinton is skillfully showing how far left of even the consensus among liberal Dems Bern has been
ChuckLane1	697976978532605952	2016-02-12T02:54:14	HillaryClinton is totally right about need to discourage children from dangerous trek and my hunch is this honesty will play badly in party
ChuckLane1	697976730003361793	2016-02-12T02:53:14	Shorter Bern on imm bill: I did what AFL and LULAC told me.
ChuckLane1	697976595588456448	2016-02-12T02:52:42	Again, HillaryClinton adds a note of realism and maturity by noting we had to discourage dangerous migration by CA kids.
ChuckLane1	697976174165815297	2016-02-12T02:51:02	Complicating factor for Bern on imm: it has added, modestly but measurably, to higher income inequality since 70s. 
ChuckLane1	697975039434461184	2016-02-12T02:46:31	Every Sanders answer is about the villain of corporate America. That’s not a criticism. I don’t think he’d deny it. It’s his worldview.
ChuckLane1	697974449904209920	2016-02-12T02:44:11	Actually, I prefer socialism, with its class-based analysis, to this one-group-at-a-time treatment of public challenges.

ChuckLane1	697973213750546433	2016-02-12T02:39:16	Gutsy for HillaryClinton not to succumb to fashionable pessimism on race, while calling for further progress.
ChuckLane1	697973066329153537	2016-02-12T02:38:41	There’s been a big decline in the black incarceration rate, and almost nobody’s paying attention 
ChuckLane1	697972862129479680	2016-02-12T02:37:52	I guarantee you that no POTUS could clear out the state prisons as fast as The Bern just irresponsibly promised.
ChuckLane1	697972662287646720	2016-02-12T02:37:05	Hey, good Bern point about recidivism!
ChuckLane1	697972441629462528	2016-02-12T02:36:12	Fact neither candidate feels obliged to add that for balance speaks volumes about current pol atmosphere. (2)

ChuckLane1	697971603343347712	2016-02-12T02:32:52	The correct answer to this is fed gov has almost nothing to do with incarceration rate in a particular state.
ChuckLane1	697971328524140545	2016-02-12T02:31:47	You know, SenSanders just a better communicator in every way than HillaryClinton example, this riff about GOP "hypocrisy" on abortion

ChuckLane1	694364314455642112	2016-02-02T03:38:47	Rubio: 2016 "referendum on our identity" as a nation. Interesting ...
ChuckLane1	694363228017709057	2016-02-02T03:34:28	RandPaul gonna drop out like Huck &amp; O'Malley? Or wait for NH?

ChuckLane1	694361457845231616	2016-02-02T03:27:26	Whether you like SenTedCruz or not, you gotta be pleased that the anti-ethanol candidate beat the Branstad ethanol-fueled engine.
ChuckLane1	694361306216992769	2016-02-02T03:26:50	Ethanol is the big loser tonight.
ChuckLane1	694361194627514368	2016-02-02T03:26:24	Is problem that polls overstated Trump support, or that they were accurate measure of preferences if no effort necessary to vote?
ChuckLane1	694360296262082560	2016-02-02T03:22:49	Hot take: Bad nite overall for Dems in Nov Bern up &amp; so is Rubio, candidate they fear most v. Hillary.

ChuckLane1	694356302944964608	2016-02-02T03:06:57	Oh, it's gonna be tough for O'Malley rounding up donors to pay off that $500K 
ChuckLane1	694355681563009029	2016-02-02T03:04:29	At least O'Malley can go home and relax in that easy chair he took from the MD gov mansion. Oh, wait:

ChuckLane1	694347178551152641	2016-02-02T02:30:42	Democrats talk a good game about ballot access and then impose this absurd, laborious process to participate in nominating.

ChuckLane1	688908780378128384	2016-01-18T02:20:27	Does The Bern favor agender netural bathrooms?
ChuckLane1	688908078020976640	2016-01-18T02:17:39	In blasting "systemic racism" in US crim justice, Hillary just went somewhere her husband never dared go.
ChuckLane1	688907707454197761	2016-01-18T02:16:11	O'Malley has a point in sense that he's only guy on stage who's actually presided over enactment of Dem agenda in full in MD (1)
ChuckLane1	688907260655984640	2016-01-18T02:14:24	Hillary has clobbered The Bern on guns tonight, no?
ChuckLane1	688906950441078784	2016-01-18T02:13:10	"Small mom and pop gun shop" is the kind of capitalism The Bern supports.
ChuckLane1	688906754588061697	2016-01-18T02:12:24	In saying guns should not be a political issue, The Bern contradicts Obama's position. Just sayin.
ChuckLane1	688906589777059840	2016-01-18T02:11:44	OK, Bern, the question was why did U change your position.
ChuckLane1	688906167070887936	2016-01-18T02:10:04	Amazing how you ask a politicians for 3 priorities and none of them can limit selves to that number. O'Malley gave 4, then said "secondly."
ChuckLane1	688905913445543936	2016-01-18T02:09:03	Shorter first 100 days under a Dem prez: Bunch of proposals that die in GOP House.

ChuckLane1	688118946210287617	2016-01-15T22:01:56	Thanks. Helpful. Just a note -- that's a different data source than I relied on.I take it the rest is nuclear? 
ChuckLane1	688112539486400512	2016-01-15T21:36:28	Wake me up when you work up the intellectual honesty to admit you were wrong to say I had my facts wrong.  
ChuckLane1	688112165702598657	2016-01-15T21:34:59	But Dan, we don't have sufficient data for his second term.

ChuckLane1	688111629427290112	2016-01-15T21:32:51	Don't have enough data yet. 
ChuckLane1	688110115753345025	2016-01-15T21:26:50	So, we have a bet? Meanwhile, how about a correction re. my data were "wrong." 
ChuckLane1	688108712020451328	2016-01-15T21:21:16	Please read my tweets. My numbers refer to "energy" as a whole, for all uses. You are going on about electricity. 
ChuckLane1	688108428640702467	2016-01-15T21:20:08	Um, that's a chart about electricity. Mine was about total energy consumption. Try again.

ChuckLane1	687862923281043456	2016-01-15T05:04:35	All along, Cruz has been offering himself as the reasonable alternative to Trump. At the debate at times, it seemed the other way around.
ChuckLane1	687860891765837824	2016-01-15T04:56:31	No need to preface realDonaldTrump quote with "wierdly." 
ChuckLane1	687860680079347712	2016-01-15T04:55:40	Absolutely funniest part of debate was Larry Tribe's walk-on role as GOP's new arbiter of who eligible be president. 
ChuckLane1	687858772396654592	2016-01-15T04:48:05	Overlooked in the rush, but a remarkable moment that 1 party's frontrunner said this: "I’ll gladly accept the mantle of anger"
ChuckLane1	687854320751099904	2016-01-15T04:30:24	ChuckLane1 my card: 1) Rubio 2) Trump 3) Cruz 4) all others -- no one cares.

ChuckLane1	687854066794377216	2016-01-15T04:29:23	If I were GOP establishment, I'd be seriously freaked out by how well realDonaldTrump did tonite.
ChuckLane1	687853688069713920	2016-01-15T04:27:53	On my card 1) Trump 2) Cruz 3) Rubio 4) Christie No one else. Rand did better than Carson.
ChuckLane1	687852929982828544	2016-01-15T04:24:52	Well, it is a lucky number . . .  
ChuckLane1	687852571873165316	2016-01-15T04:23:27	When Carson says we can't solve this with traditional politics we can only do it with we the people, he's saying same stuff as The Bern
ChuckLane1	687852238690213888	2016-01-15T04:22:08	Christie's great advantage is he appears relaxed up there.
ChuckLane1	687851933420371969	2016-01-15T04:20:55	In this great land of ours, a man with no public speaking ability can get to be a two-term governor of a major state
ChuckLane1	687851640314028036	2016-01-15T04:19:45	Dad the mailman. Drink!
ChuckLane1	687851420935143424	2016-01-15T04:18:53	Clock? 
ChuckLane1	687851082316398592	2016-01-15T04:17:32	Like, Rubio had his moment of hitting Cruz but the moments of the debate went to Trump.
ChuckLane1	687851055519002624	2016-01-15T04:17:25	RT if you really like that suit Samuel L. Jackson is wearing.
ChuckLane1	687850707911864320	2016-01-15T04:16:03	Read the transcript tomorrow before you decide whether he was really counting, or just pulled that no. out of his .. 
ChuckLane1	687849688549191681	2016-01-15T04:12:00	How did SenTedCruz count to 11 attacks there?
ChuckLane1	687849604528902145	2016-01-15T04:11:40	Rubio just scored some points on SenTedCruz right there.
ChuckLane1	687849331655880704	2016-01-15T04:10:34	Wrong. Shorter Rubio: I will blithely ignore your question about why I favor more green cards. 
ChuckLane1	687848800866689024	2016-01-15T04:08:28	RameshPonnuru Sounded like Black Lives Matter to me.
ChuckLane1	687848631848857600	2016-01-15T04:07:48	My impression, too. He was pretty good on that police question. 
ChuckLane1	687848295453069312	2016-01-15T04:06:27	Context here for quiet studio audience may be that extremely ugly police shooting of guy running away in North Charleston SC
ChuckLane1	687848084177612800	2016-01-15T04:05:37	Obama continues to give us the politics we ‘deserve’ 
ChuckLane1	687847728705978368	2016-01-15T04:04:12	In politics, writes ChuckLane1, "deserve" is everywhere--but Madison Ave. got there first.  (Quotes me.)
ChuckLane1	687847579078541312	2016-01-15T04:03:37	Christie said a coupla words, but yeah, we're not. 
ChuckLane1	687847285267501057	2016-01-15T04:02:27	No it doesn't  
ChuckLane1	687846357835603969	2016-01-15T03:58:45	Serious point about VAT: Specter of "cash machine" overblown. EUR parliamentary systems, yes. But in US, very hard to raise taxes.
ChuckLane1	687845947238412288	2016-01-15T03:57:08	Small upward adjustment in income ceiling + chained CPI w/carve-outs for extremely needy, and we're pretty much done 
ChuckLane1	687845439526277120	2016-01-15T03:55:06	If the next Harry Reid proposes raising VAT to 30 pc, the next Mitch McConnell would filibuster it.
ChuckLane1	687845227466518529	2016-01-15T03:54:16	jbouie I agree. But when anyone proposes one of those tweaks, he gets demagogued for supposedly destroying it.
ChuckLane1	687845035174395904	2016-01-15T03:53:30	Has any candidate's tax plan ever been enacted into law in the form it was proposed in a campaign?
ChuckLane1	687844807247527938	2016-01-15T03:52:36	At some point before 11PM I suppose they will get around to answering the question about entitlements.
ChuckLane1	687844559611674624	2016-01-15T03:51:37	marcorubio on entitlements: I oppose a VAT.
ChuckLane1	687843869615091713	2016-01-15T03:48:52	I may have missed it but that Christie answer on infrastructure missed an opportunity to call for Davis-Bacon repeal, right?
ChuckLane1	687843644301250560	2016-01-15T03:47:58	Just guessing, but probably they have a state version of Davis-Bacon he couldn't repeal? 
ChuckLane1	687843013016600576	2016-01-15T03:45:28	Hasn't even come up. Great point. 
ChuckLane1	687842601039454209	2016-01-15T03:43:50	Oh, for heaven's sakes. As long as there's federal taxes, i.e., forever, you need a federal agency to collect em.  
ChuckLane1	687841944844791809	2016-01-15T03:41:13	"Abolish the IRS." Yeah, that's going to happen.
ChuckLane1	687841403787984897	2016-01-15T03:39:04	Good Jeb argument invoking Boeing to point out why realDonaldTrump tariff would be a mistake.
ChuckLane1	687841267636682752	2016-01-15T03:38:32	How would Carl Icahn stop Japan from devaluing its currency?
ChuckLane1	687841045233692672	2016-01-15T03:37:39	Have any of these guys noticed that China is kinda tanking itself right now?
ChuckLane1	687840896587546625	2016-01-15T03:37:03	Holy smokes. marcorubio just points out that tariffs on China also hurt US consumers.
ChuckLane1	687840369610993664	2016-01-15T03:34:58	Kasich believes in the PTT. What is his position on TPP, however?
ChuckLane1	687840183681683461	2016-01-15T03:34:13	You know, I'm getting the feeling right now that lots of things make realDonaldTrump angry, but China really pisses him off.
ChuckLane1	687839638883454976	2016-01-15T03:32:04	Trump is wrong: China does NOT have "total control" of North Korea. Not even close.
ChuckLane1	687839133058908160	2016-01-15T03:30:03	Did RealBenCarson just suggest putting Israel in charge of US immigration?
ChuckLane1	687838713074847745	2016-01-15T03:28:23	Focused like a laser. Drink!
ChuckLane1	687838593134542849	2016-01-15T03:27:54	marcorubio strong in pushing back against Obama's minimization of ISIS threat.
ChuckLane1	687838333066702848	2016-01-15T03:26:52	He probably won't win, but you gotta hand it to Chris Christie for coming back from zero, and proving he's still got political talent.
ChuckLane1	687837704130850817	2016-01-15T03:24:22	OK, no. The police are not the most mistreated people in this country.
ChuckLane1	687837446638301184	2016-01-15T03:23:21	Jeb's having his moment now. Strong on pragmatic need not to alienate Muslims.
ChuckLane1	687837148419112960	2016-01-15T03:22:10	Everyone on this stage is saying can't be world's policeman, just like Obama in SOT, because it's poll-tested.
ChuckLane1	687836809464786944	2016-01-15T03:20:49	realDonaldTrump just said some of his best friends are Muslim.
ChuckLane1	687836515725099008	2016-01-15T03:19:39	So Chris Christie will "bring people together" in the Middle East.
ChuckLane1	687835903243468800	2016-01-15T03:17:13	Actually, ISIS banned smoking, Dr. Carson, "so they would not be sitting there, smoking their cigars."
ChuckLane1	687835553023262720	2016-01-15T03:15:49	20K troops, Dr. Carson? I'll ask the military and get back to you.
ChuckLane1	687835006245404673	2016-01-15T03:13:39	Does Goldman Sachs have New York values?
ChuckLane1	687833825326575616	2016-01-15T03:08:57	Hey didn't that loan come from New York?
ChuckLane1	687833381653057536	2016-01-15T03:07:12	Trump and Cruz really do have fantastic speaking talent, and have now had two invigorating clashes about matters of no substance whatever.
ChuckLane1	687833237775855616	2016-01-15T03:06:37	Question for Trump: If New York values are great because 9/11, are New Jersey values grotesque because of all the celebrating Muslims?
ChuckLane1	687833273574256641	2016-01-15T03:06:46	Aaaannnddd over here Jeb is talking about the sequester ...
ChuckLane1	687833011514138624	2016-01-15T03:05:43	And when it comes to "very insulting statements," you have to defer to realDonaldTrump's expertise, I suppose.
ChuckLane1	687832739538694144	2016-01-15T03:04:39	realDonaldTrump ode to NY on 9/11 is his best moment.
ChuckLane1	687832501465776128	2016-01-15T03:03:42	SenTedCruz is totally wandering here on New York point
ChuckLane1	687832408612302850	2016-01-15T03:03:20	smh 
ChuckLane1	687832302949416961	2016-01-15T03:02:54	So, who wants to be SenTedCruz's New York chairman?
ChuckLane1	687831884047462400	2016-01-15T03:01:15	Is Dianne Feinstein running?
ChuckLane1	687831665037676544	2016-01-15T03:00:22	Uh, no need to kick BarackObama out of WH, Gov. Christie. He can't stay after January. It's in Constitution somewhere near the 2nd am
ChuckLane1	687830917587533825	2016-01-15T02:57:24	Good "bitter clinger" recall by marcorubio just now.
ChuckLane1	687830280078508032	2016-01-15T02:54:52	Did realDonaldTrump just say, unironically, "we have a huge mental health problem in this country?"
ChuckLane1	687830054261403648	2016-01-15T02:53:58	Well, POTUS did just ask Congress for more mental health funding, didn't he?
ChuckLane1	687829138430898176	2016-01-15T02:50:20	I'm looking forward to this new George Clooney movie that appears to glorify class-based terrorism.
ChuckLane1	687828782720397312	2016-01-15T02:48:55	In that case, RandPaul is the real winner! 
ChuckLane1	687828453920473088	2016-01-15T02:47:37	Jeb is a total non-presence so far.
ChuckLane1	687828241021841408	2016-01-15T02:46:46	This is the grumpy old man Ben Carson answer ...
ChuckLane1	687827911915782144	2016-01-15T02:45:28	I love the way Kasich makes it seem like chairman of powerless House Budget Committee was the most decisive position in DC
ChuckLane1	687827469051781120	2016-01-15T02:43:42	Wins the Internet: 
ChuckLane1	687827071071031298	2016-01-15T02:42:07	"Discount the things you're going to hear in these ads" Did Jeb tell that to the donors before he got them to pay for the ads
ChuckLane1	687826776383438848	2016-01-15T02:40:57	I suspect Rubio still thinks New Jersey needs Christie
ChuckLane1	687826396954112002	2016-01-15T02:39:26	"Indignation." Drink!
ChuckLane1	687826132905914368	2016-01-15T02:38:23	He wasn't during the birther debate with SenTedCruz 
ChuckLane1	687825640880476160	2016-01-15T02:36:26	"I will gladly accept the mantle of anger." That is a strong line for realDonaldTrump in this crowd.
ChuckLane1	687825314240684033	2016-01-15T02:35:08	Yep. That's gonna leave a mark. 
ChuckLane1	687825140332249089	2016-01-15T02:34:27	Yeah, that's going to leave a self-imposed mark. 
ChuckLane1	687824939622215680	2016-01-15T02:33:39	Don't mess with SenTedCruz on Supreme Court stuff...
