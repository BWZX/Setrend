bradplumer	724435204782342145	2016-04-25T03:09:46	These entrepreneurs are using technology to turn a profit on food waste:  
bradplumer	724427240537239552	2016-04-25T02:38:08	Thoughtful and interesting take on solar price decline from something of a former solar skeptic, DKeithClimate.  
bradplumer	724431346920103936	2016-04-25T02:54:27	So this was Melisandre all along huh 
bradplumer	720293213009870848	2016-04-13T16:50:59	My deep look at the keepitintheground movement, which hopes to end coal, oil and gas extraction on public lands:

bradplumer	724294147499266049	2016-04-24T17:49:16	In defense of processed food: 
bradplumer	724264751396720640	2016-04-24T15:52:27	Japan does density better than we do, but there's a lot of urban planning stuff they mess up. 
bradplumer	724001100345446400	2016-04-23T22:24:48	5. There's plenty of work to be done. Very hard problems to be solved. No panaceas here. But most cleantech analysis far too conservative.
bradplumer	724000282464542721	2016-04-23T22:21:33	3. Examples: -Storage ups value of solar/wind -EV &amp; grid storage both drive innovation in core tech, lowering prices for each other.
bradplumer	723999805853179904	2016-04-23T22:19:39	2. Most analysis of cleantech progress misses that these trends accelerate each other. Another way in which most analysis is conservative.
bradplumer	723999473869819907	2016-04-23T22:18:20	1. We're transitioning simultaneously to: -Solar &amp; wind -Grid storage -Electric transport These amplify each other. Positive feedback loops.
bradplumer	723983051689172992	2016-04-23T21:13:05	Very exciting outlook for renewables but much uncertainty about what business models will best succeed to get there

bradplumer	723525583213309953	2016-04-22T14:55:16	Agree with drvox: Putting a price on carbon is a fine idea. It's not the end-all, be-all.

bradplumer	723184555272728576	2016-04-21T16:20:08	samori8 drvox hate to do spoilers, but the scene where james hansen reveals that he is william nordhaus' father is really well done, imo
bradplumer	723183418654093312	2016-04-21T16:15:37	twkovach yeah, that's fair. i guess analyzing weather data plus mapping flood zones could help, but it's a good q!
bradplumer	723182663691968512	2016-04-21T16:12:37	twkovach hmm, intuitively that seems easier than a lot of the other challenges — especially if signs are put up.
bradplumer	723176173467930624	2016-04-21T15:46:50	bslotterback yeah, it's a super crude approximation. doesn't account for others moving to bay area. or construction. or all sorts of things

bradplumer	723039991488647169	2016-04-21T06:45:42	ShellenbergerMD yeah, that's what we were talking about. would have a very big effect on electricity, much smaller on transportation.

bradplumer	722889618375385089	2016-04-20T20:48:10	noahqk yeah, although it had a lot of quirks and i'm not sure i fully understand it 
bradplumer	722889152161681408	2016-04-20T20:46:19	noahqk hm. CAFE has been easier than gas tax, Clean Power Plan easier than cap-and-trade, etc. But agree it's tough q. Lots of nuances.
bradplumer	722887928200835072	2016-04-20T20:41:27	noahqk that said, industrial policy can also backfire pretty badly 
bradplumer	722887785586118658	2016-04-20T20:40:53	noahqk ha! well, you can point to isolated cases (decarbonization in sweden/france/ontario were driven by regulation, not price)
bradplumer	722886023181520896	2016-04-20T20:33:53	noahqk well, on the latter count, so far it has been...
bradplumer	722878323982999553	2016-04-20T20:03:17	Excellent piece by bradplumer. Why crude oil prices keep taking us by surprise  voxdotcom
bradplumer	722866189278392320	2016-04-20T19:15:04	EthonRaptor yeah, i wish i could amend "affect" to "cover." totally agree it would have an indirect effect.
bradplumer	722865882641276928	2016-04-20T19:13:51	jgkoomey yep, totally agree!
bradplumer	722865812944527360	2016-04-20T19:13:34	PCalith that's a really good question...
bradplumer	722865295992299520	2016-04-20T19:11:31	Yep, though a $10/ton CO2 tax would raise gasoline prices by ~9 cents. Barely move the needle on transportation. 
bradplumer	722863628693536769	2016-04-20T19:04:53	That said, a carbon tax wouldn't affect a lot of these sectors (like agriculture or forestry), so I'd agree that it's not nearly sufficient.
bradplumer	722863326301016065	2016-04-20T19:03:41	But then you've still gotta figure out agriculture, industry, air, shipping, land-use change, natural gas... if you want to get to zero.
bradplumer	722863165181009922	2016-04-20T19:03:03	Transportation is another 31%. So fix coal and transportation (not exactly easy) and you're still just halfway there.
bradplumer	722863038043295744	2016-04-20T19:02:33	Coal burning/mining is about 24% of US greenhouse gas emissions. Still leaves a long ways to zero: 
bradplumer	722862107021017089	2016-04-20T18:58:51	Agree with some of this Krugman post on carbon pricing, but this seems quite wrong:  
bradplumer	722843179544760321	2016-04-20T17:43:38	petedanko that's up to the people living there (not me anymore). just pointing out that the environmental benefits can be quite substantial
bradplumer	722840211776901120	2016-04-20T17:31:50	Semeye there are earthquake based limits but that doesn't seem to be the bigest constraint on density right now

bradplumer	722837469612249088	2016-04-20T17:20:57	Apinak we certainly *could* sustainably support 9 billion and high growth. will we? that's not really possible to answer.
bradplumer	722837122974031872	2016-04-20T17:19:34	Boosting housing density in San Francisco would do far more for climate than its new solar law. Here's a silly chart 
bradplumer	722829696870711297	2016-04-20T16:50:03	Apinak depends heavily on what technologies (esp. for energy) we use. there's no one answer here.
bradplumer	722791829452685312	2016-04-20T14:19:35	Baardkj now we're talking!
bradplumer	722789540578996224	2016-04-20T14:10:29	That said, I was already on board with that. Would be curious to know how the arguments read to someone who disagreed.
bradplumer	722789469049397248	2016-04-20T14:10:12	Agree that the green left position should be broadly pro-growth and pro-technology rather than (as it is in some corners) pro-austerity.
bradplumer	722789443833204742	2016-04-20T14:10:06	Just finished Leigh_Phillips' "Austerity Ecology &amp; the Collapse-Porn Addicts." Liked it quite a bit: 
bradplumer	722788096442392578	2016-04-20T14:04:45	Higher housing density typically means lower emissions. Less driving, lower electricity use…  
bradplumer	722785642342559746	2016-04-20T13:55:00	You know what would've been an even greener move, though? Increasing housing density!

bradplumer	722611934512750592	2016-04-20T02:24:45	alannogee i didn't read that as opposing RPS—but more complementing it with policies to help emerging tech too. vsiv TerynNorris
bradplumer	722607439120572416	2016-04-20T02:06:53	Woohoo. Got a copy of savortooth's "Unseen City." Incredibly excited to read this:

bradplumer	722542020519182336	2016-04-19T21:46:56	Good levi_m post. There are lots of energy/climate questions that can't be answered by science alone: 
bradplumer	722537047039336449	2016-04-19T21:27:10	jaimedash the press release came from the university 
bradplumer	722536808945434624	2016-04-19T21:26:13	(It's a weirdly vague claim anyway. Technically we could phase out all fossil fuel use tomorrow. But that doesn't tell us anything useful…)
bradplumer	722533572926644224	2016-04-19T21:13:22	Press releases are often quite misleading. At least take a peek at the paper itself. This one was even free to read...
bradplumer	722533119182663680	2016-04-19T21:11:34	chrisnelder i mean technically we could phase out fossil fuels tomorrow if we really really wanted to!
bradplumer	722532453911502849	2016-04-19T21:08:55	Again, the actual study *does not say this* at all:  Only the press release.

bradplumer	722499499302744064	2016-04-19T18:57:58	BeCurieus i think the bad actor here is the PR shop (and lazy journalists). the paper seems reasonable enough.
bradplumer	722498047574482944	2016-04-19T18:52:12	Ha, just finished reading. And *nowhere* in the paper does it say we can phase out fossil fuels in ten years.
bradplumer	722497460246081536	2016-04-19T18:49:52	BlairKing_ca in fact, the paper itself does not even claim that we can get off fossil fuels in 10 years. only the press release
bradplumer	722496799869706240	2016-04-19T18:47:15	BlairKing_ca a study of small-scale transitions is interesting! but, yes, you can't just leap to "we can get off fossil fuels in 10 years!"
bradplumer	722491210636660736	2016-04-19T18:25:02	The full paper is quite interesting:  (Sadly, the Vice article is just a rewrite of an overheated press release.)

bradplumer	717362653958680576	2016-04-05T14:45:59	That said, we're going to have to adapt to a lot of this stuff *even if* we cut CO2 drastically. A lot of changes are already baked in.

bradplumer	717353887339003904	2016-04-05T14:11:09	bradplumer I think we have to do the former to some capacity, at the very least to capture emissions from metallurgic coal use
bradplumer	717353673010069504	2016-04-05T14:10:18	Here's a question: Given finite sequestration capacity, does it make more sense to prioritize coal/gas CCS or negative emissions BECCS?
bradplumer	717353322093658113	2016-04-05T14:08:54	I guess we'll find out in a few years if it works. (And if CCS is economical.) But zero-emissions natural gas plants would be a huge boon.

bradplumer	685472904528719872	2016-01-08T14:47:30	I really enjoyed our conversation with bradplumer on yesterday's podcast. I think you will too: 
bradplumer	685491534100348928	2016-01-08T16:01:32	liamdenning chrisnelder bradplumer Limited power indeed, see Gazprom, Chinese NOCs &amp; others that have floated token shares
bradplumer	685491152003436544	2016-01-08T16:00:01	vorbis oh geez, sorry to hear that. (and yes, it's not an anti-vaccination piece, but definitely a real issue.)
bradplumer	685490655393615886	2016-01-08T15:58:02	We've almost eradicated polio. Ironically, one big threat now is... the vaccines themselves: 
bradplumer	685487954484056072	2016-01-08T15:47:18	chrisnelder bradplumer re: Aramco. Doubt upstream IPO but in any case, I think minority shareholders in a NOC have little real power
bradplumer	685487011411591168	2016-01-08T15:43:33	gabrielmarty bradplumer Yeah, that'd be my guess too. Probably looking for just enough cash to ride out another yr of low prices.
bradplumer	685487039979122692	2016-01-08T15:43:40	gabrielmarty chrisnelder ah, i'd missed that. makes sense!
bradplumer	685486515414286338	2016-01-08T15:41:35	bradplumer even if it was, it's likely to be a small share (TheEconomist mentioned up to 5%) &amp; Saudis would keep control chrisnelder
bradplumer	685486121778823168	2016-01-08T15:40:01	bradplumer obviously, still a lot of unknowns, but looks unlikely that the IPO would concern upstream business chrisnelder
bradplumer	685485890194419712	2016-01-08T15:39:06	bradplumer But yes - far too early to say. This is just a glimmer of an idea so far, from what I can tell.
bradplumer	685485811328929796	2016-01-08T15:38:47	bradplumer They would presumably have less latitude over output control if they have to answer to investors - maintain cash flow, etc.
bradplumer	685485659113549824	2016-01-08T15:38:11	chrisnelder yeah, fair point, might be a little premature with this
bradplumer	685485435779461120	2016-01-08T15:37:18	bradplumer Depends on what the offering is. If it's "a bundle [of] its downstream subsidiaries" then no. If it's the whole company, maybe.
bradplumer	685483791322877952	2016-01-08T15:30:46	Like would the calculus for whether/when Saudi Arabia cuts back on output change at all?
bradplumer	685483704085573632	2016-01-08T15:30:25	So if Saudi Aramco goes public, how would that affect Saudi Arabia's ability to act as a swing producer of oil?

bradplumer	684873070012583936	2016-01-06T23:03:58	AthertonKD agree. i also don't think their atomic bombs can get as big as the first.

bradplumer	684842197108129794	2016-01-06T21:01:18	Basically dentists just consider us all hopeless idiots who will never floss (true) so they've resigned themselves to stressing brushing.
bradplumer	684842093513027584	2016-01-06T21:00:53	Huh. I genuinely had no idea that flossing was considered more important than brushing your teeth. 
bradplumer	684810831301771264	2016-01-06T18:56:40	Content of EOs matter more than quantity. Big gap btw Emancipation Proclamation and some interagency working group. 
bradplumer	684808124914483200	2016-01-06T18:45:54	BeCurieus yeah, true, i guess that should say "doesn't look like North Korea has built a working version of the latter (yet?)"
bradplumer	684806862374502400	2016-01-06T18:40:53	(Fortunately, doesn't look like North Korea has built the latter.)

bradplumer	682638375824814081	2015-12-31T19:04:06	One possibility is that people won't really notice, due to shifting baselines: 
bradplumer	682638328768937985	2015-12-31T19:03:55	Another long-held assumption is that as climate change worsens and extreme weather increases, more people will care. Is that true?
bradplumer	682637593171865605	2015-12-31T19:00:59	bradplumer there was research on climate attitudes after floods in Britain. But it seemed to show changes were only only short term.
bradplumer	682637312136732672	2015-12-31T18:59:52	alittlelilypad yeah, that's a long-standing assumption among climate folks (me included). i just (genuinely) don't know if it's true or not
bradplumer	682637163478007808	2015-12-31T18:59:17	CountCarbon there's also the corollary that as climate change worsens over time, more people will wake up. but is that true? dunno
bradplumer	682636377285079040	2015-12-31T18:56:09	Honest q: How big are the stakes in the endless "was this weather event caused by climate change" fights? Has it ever changed any minds?
bradplumer	682630901692514305	2015-12-31T18:34:24	I'm still writing this on all my checks. 
bradplumer	682630402620690432	2015-12-31T18:32:25	What economists miss about electric-car subsidies. Good post by drvox: 
bradplumer	682618079138824192	2015-12-31T17:43:27	bradplumer Corn ethonol efficiency can purportedly be increased with this trait: 
bradplumer	682617056462671873	2015-12-31T17:39:23	CountCarbon hmm. that does seem like a huge obstacle.
bradplumer	682616837083799552	2015-12-31T17:38:31	CherylRofer apparently not! (though they do have other problems.)
bradplumer	682616208147877888	2015-12-31T17:36:01	Interesting. Genetic engineering to reduce the amount of lignin in wood could lead to better/cheaper biofuels. 
bradplumer	682614003638480897	2015-12-31T17:27:15	Very curious to see how/whether the transparency measures in the Paris agreement might change this at all.
bradplumer	682613754396192772	2015-12-31T17:26:16	It is staggering how important China is to climate change and how little anyone knows about what's going on there. 
bradplumer	682611381355454464	2015-12-31T17:16:50	Yep. Some excellent background in this countcarbon post:  
bradplumer	682609764006666240	2015-12-31T17:10:24	China's taking big steps to close coal mines and limit production. (Though, note, past attempts haven't all worked.) 
bradplumer	682607021619867650	2015-12-31T16:59:30	libbyanelson got an alert that libby now holds the record with 46 straight jeopardy wins.
bradplumer	682606287058788352	2015-12-31T16:56:35	CountCarbon dbiello yeah, definitely. (i think a big chunk of the non-GM corn is sweet corn, which i don't think is used for ethanol)
bradplumer	682606086269079552	2015-12-31T16:55:47	Oh duh... yes, right. Though those modifications weren't made with fuel per se in mind. 
bradplumer	682605374550208512	2015-12-31T16:52:58	Asked and answered. Here's research on using genetic engineering to produce fast-growing switchgrass for biofuel. 
bradplumer	682604498494353408	2015-12-31T16:49:29	Which raises the question... *are* there any GMO biofuels in the works?
