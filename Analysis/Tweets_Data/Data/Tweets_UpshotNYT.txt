UpshotNYT	709928824998338560	2016-03-16T02:26:36	It's so close in Missouri, but Cruz just isn't really netting votes anywhere outside of the Ozarks.
UpshotNYT	709929196223664129	2016-03-16T02:28:04	Sanders' path in Illinois is looking pretty tough. Not faring well enough outside of Cook County.
UpshotNYT	709924459088576512	2016-03-16T02:09:15	I'd say Trump slightly favored on assumption he'll win the St. Louis area, but not much in yet.  
UpshotNYT	709922845107884032	2016-03-16T02:02:50	Missouri could not be closer. Clinton margins in St. Louis and/or Kansas will decide it. 
UpshotNYT	709918640053866496	2016-03-16T01:46:08	Trump winning IL big with the same share of vote in NC/MO, since Cruz is so weak in blue states. Big Trump asset in 2nd half of primaries.
UpshotNYT	709918369324134400	2016-03-16T01:45:03	Hillary Clinton is up by about 6 points in Illinois, the Upshot model says.  
UpshotNYT	709904086850781184	2016-03-16T00:48:18	Oh, my. Our live estimator is showing a sweep for Hillary Clinton. The model is not feeling the Bern. 
UpshotNYT	709893459633692673	2016-03-16T00:06:04	This is the chart to keep an eye on tonight:  
UpshotNYT	709898324002869249	2016-03-16T00:25:24	The early vote in Ohio was pretty old. In Franklin County, for instance, 46% were ages 65 and over. Clinton can't keep these margins up
UpshotNYT	709894310033035265	2016-03-16T00:09:27	Still a little crazy in Ohio, according to the Upshot results estimator.

UpshotNYT	709892745062649856	2016-03-16T00:03:14	This is North Carolina results, but this early it is volatile. See for yourself:

UpshotNYT	709884794382000128	2016-03-15T23:31:38	Clinton could net 60+ delegates out of Florida at this rate, increasing her overall delegate lead by 30%
UpshotNYT	709887845540995073	2016-03-15T23:43:46	Clinton's up by 30 pts in North Carolina in the early vote, 36 pts in FL. If it held, that would cancel all of Sanders' wins this year.
UpshotNYT	709889612790042624	2016-03-15T23:50:47	There are a few places in FL where the election day vote has largely come in. Both Clinton and Trump slip a little, not much. Big W for both

UpshotNYT	709783567371509760	2016-03-15T16:49:24	One reason Clinton is projected so strong in the NE corridor is the high income. She's excelled in affluent areas (think Boston area/NoVA)
