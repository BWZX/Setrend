GabrielRossman	707261150908420097	2016-03-08T17:46:13	mike_bader I think that's half right
GabrielRossman	707261057304145920	2016-03-08T17:45:50	mike_bader In contrast Trump throws out any pretense of fusionist ideology or policy coherence
GabrielRossman	707260759122677760	2016-03-08T17:44:39	mike_bader That's different since ideologically they were orthodox fusionists even if their political tactics were restless
GabrielRossman	707260482856427520	2016-03-08T17:43:34	mike_bader in contrast, the enduring lead for Trump is profoundly dispiriting and promises a more serious war within the party
