ramit	713426971561058305	2016-03-25T18:06:59	9/ In conclusion, never ask your readers for marketing advice. Just don’t do it. Good bye
ramit	713426969224826880	2016-03-25T18:06:58	8/ It would also hurt to waste time on unprofitable/futile tactics. Same with your career search, dating, and business launch
ramit	713426708007768064	2016-03-25T18:05:56	7/ Third, when you hear someone say, “It couldn’t hurt” — it actually could. It would hurt me to sit in McDonald’s

ramit	713425594260717568	2016-03-25T18:01:31	2/ Among the comments, one person told me to go to McDonald’s and give free happy meals in exchange for talking about IWT
