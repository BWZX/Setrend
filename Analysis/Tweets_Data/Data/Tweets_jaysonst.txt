jaysonst	726236354493952000	2016-04-30T02:26:54	Never happened  
jaysonst	726198375062884352	2016-04-29T23:55:59	Did you read what I wrote? I specifically didn't make excuses  
jaysonst	726188023638011905	2016-04-29T23:14:51	alysonfooter Thanks Alyson!
jaysonst	726183563612311552	2016-04-29T22:57:08	But a 162-game season isn't an insane grind? Don't get your point  
jaysonst	726182702739640322	2016-04-29T22:53:42	They have more than triple the suspensions! 
jaysonst	726182506295361537	2016-04-29T22:52:55	Did you know the NFL doesn't even announce its PED suspensions? Let's individual teams do it. Harder to track 
jaysonst	726181777656651776	2016-04-29T22:50:02	So integrity isn't meaningful in the NFL? I wonder if the NFL knows!

jaysonst	726179906292465666	2016-04-29T22:42:36	Hold on. Many more PED suspensions in the NFL every year. Just no one seems to care 
jaysonst	726154555285725188	2016-04-29T21:01:51	My column: Five things we've learned from Dee Gordon's suspension 
jaysonst	726072519644577792	2016-04-29T15:35:53	Update to our story: Source says Dee Gordon tested positive during spring training 
jaysonst	726027495259160576	2016-04-29T12:36:58	Dee Gordon's positive PED test further illustrates the lunacy of our speculation in regards to who uses and who doesn't. Slippery slope.
jaysonst	726019502316515328	2016-04-29T12:05:12	Dee Gordon's PED suspension is a shocker. But it's also a reminder that for most players, PED use was never... 
jaysonst	725850616405307392	2016-04-29T00:54:07	Can't see them going HS pitcher if they like the other options. Which they clearly do.  
jaysonst	725850097980940288	2016-04-29T00:52:03	jaysonst definitely. Easy to see as impact reliever as jumbo Andrew Miller type. And maybe he starts.
jaysonst	725849855038504960	2016-04-29T00:51:05	Close to the big leagues. Safest choice. Fits with arrival time of their other prospects. Makes sense, right? 
jaysonst	725844907542368257	2016-04-29T00:31:26	Carson Wentz is off the board, so next big pick in Phila is the Phillies picking 1st in MLB. Other teams say they're zeroing in on AJ Puk
jaysonst	725841988252213250	2016-04-29T00:19:50	Last time the Phillies were 2 games over .500 this "late" in a season? Oct. 1, 2012 (at 81-79). Been a while.

jaysonst	725791299278888960	2016-04-28T20:58:24	Wouldn't be the first time stealing first has been attempted in a game involving the Brewers. Ask Haudricourt 
jaysonst	725786801932218368	2016-04-28T20:40:32	Jake Arrieta's streak of 24 straight quality starts ended today. So Bob Gibson (26) hangs onto a record he didn't know he was setting in '68
jaysonst	725786551809118208	2016-04-28T20:39:33	OK, repeat after me. "Regular season innings." 
jaysonst	725785769277792256	2016-04-28T20:36:26	Raising my hand! 
jaysonst	725771159652933634	2016-04-28T19:38:23	Only 5 other pitchers in the live-ball era ever crammed 7+ walks &amp; 9+ K's into an outing that short. hardtodo

jaysonst	725686926091653120	2016-04-28T14:03:40	BigJoe4Braves espn And what exactly are "we" doing? All I did was tell an interesting story, about a great player with something to say.
jaysonst	725668194216603648	2016-04-28T12:49:14	One more time ICYMI - Who's the man in the middle of baseball's growing culture war? Bryce Harper. Who else? 
jaysonst	725504513034039296	2016-04-28T01:58:49	Prior to Freddie Freeman's homer in the 7th, Braves had hit just 1 HR in team's prior 774 PA dating back to the 4th inning of Opening Day.
jaysonst	725503786916175872	2016-04-28T01:55:56	The Braves have homered. Their trot-less nightmare over. In those 2 1/2 weeks between their homers, all the other teams hit 437 of them.
jaysonst	725495226131947522	2016-04-28T01:21:55	Odubel Herrera just walked again. On pace to BB 154 times. The only men w/ 154-BB seasons in history: Bonds, Ruth, Ted, McGwire. Wait. What?
jaysonst	725437178977878017	2016-04-27T21:31:16	How 'bout that! I'll let you all move on with your lives now. But it's been a fun day talking Bryce-a-palooza! 
jaysonst	725436535701659651	2016-04-27T21:28:42	The media writes/talks about the best players &amp; most interesting players. How does he not qualify on either count? 
jaysonst	725436218050269185	2016-04-27T21:27:26	CoveChatter Don't blame you. Sorry that happened!
jaysonst	725435980296146945	2016-04-27T21:26:30	Guess what? ESPN never told us he's the "chosen one." And I'm not telling you to like him. But he's a dynamic talent 
jaysonst	725435540212965381	2016-04-27T21:24:45	But why is it bad for the sport if he's That Guy You Love to Hate? Every sport needs players like that. 
jaysonst	725434306949206016	2016-04-27T21:19:51	Absolutely. And that's good for the sport, whether you like him or not. 
jaysonst	725434195263262720	2016-04-27T21:19:24	CoveChatter I wasn't disrespecting you. Just disagreeing with you. Others piled on. Life on Twitter gets messy. But no disrespect here
jaysonst	725427448503001092	2016-04-27T20:52:36	OK, I've got good news. I'm going to stop clogging your Twitter feeds on Bryce. Chatting about it in 8 minutes here 
jaysonst	725427267619409922	2016-04-27T20:51:53	Absolutely. When I teach Sports Fun 101, that will be the first lesson. 
jaysonst	725426773232640000	2016-04-27T20:49:55	There's another guy who's got it all. If I ran MLB, I'd hitch the whole sport to his back. 
jaysonst	725426593049513984	2016-04-27T20:49:12	Baer_Bill Hahaha. That kitten had better cover his eyes and ears!
jaysonst	725426411520053248	2016-04-27T20:48:28	Of course he can be. He should be. It's not his thing. But there's nothing about Trout that isn't awesome. 
jaysonst	725425807804518402	2016-04-27T20:46:04	I'm not telling them how to act. He's not either. But it's important for the sport to reach the next generation 
jaysonst	725425570713112577	2016-04-27T20:45:08	Might have to have their Little League coaches teach them how to flip! 
jaysonst	725425376009306112	2016-04-27T20:44:22	I'm with you! There are times to celebrate and times not to. But don't suppress the personality of your stars 
jaysonst	725424974278844416	2016-04-27T20:42:46	The commissioner called him the spokesman for his generation. Doesn't speak for everyone. But an important message 
jaysonst	725424597219176448	2016-04-27T20:41:16	You're totally right. Goose Gossage represented the whole "In My Day" crowd. And not well I might add! 
jaysonst	725424157337391105	2016-04-27T20:39:31	I see many more fist pumps than bat flips. But why are we living in a world where either is bad? 
jaysonst	725422129416642560	2016-04-27T20:31:28	That might need to happen if it gets out of hand. But we're not there yet! 
jaysonst	725421643082829824	2016-04-27T20:29:32	Dusty actually talks about this in the column.  Always a possibility!  
jaysonst	725421357370994688	2016-04-27T20:28:23	Of course they will. It's not for me, Harper or anyone else to say where that line is. But that's true now too.  
jaysonst	725420786824171521	2016-04-27T20:26:07	That's what I'm talking about. More importantly, it's what Bryce Harper and his generation are talking about. 
jaysonst	725420580250484737	2016-04-27T20:25:18	I don't disagree. Some guys will always cross the line, wherever you draw it. But it's time to move that line. 
jaysonst	725420139567546368	2016-04-27T20:23:33	It's still fun. For those of us who love it. Don't take "fun" literally. Allow players to show emotion/personality 
jaysonst	725419231899062272	2016-04-27T20:19:57	TommyTerrific11 Happy to do that down the road!
jaysonst	725418724568739842	2016-04-27T20:17:56	Thanks! And that debate starts shortly right here!  
jaysonst	725418543164968960	2016-04-27T20:17:12	I'm a believer in players being allowed to express their emotions. That's on both sides. Hitters &amp; pitchers 
jaysonst	725418025264934912	2016-04-27T20:15:09	The essence of Bryce Harper's idea of "fun:" "Game on the line, huge moment, you never know what you're going to do" 
jaysonst	725410182512168960	2016-04-27T19:43:59	OK, here's how the Facebook chat will work. You can start submitting questions &amp; comments in about 15 minutes here 
jaysonst	725409452384460801	2016-04-27T19:41:05	joe_sheehan Thanks, Joe!
jaysonst	725407546345984001	2016-04-27T19:33:31	I'm going to chat about my Bryce Harper column on the Baseball Tonight Facebook page from 5-5:30 ET. Details soon 
jaysonst	725400269803151360	2016-04-27T19:04:36	HOF_SportsFan hook316 Seriously? Are you familiar with me at all? I'm the last guy you'll ever find stirring up controversy just to do it
jaysonst	725394984036347906	2016-04-27T18:43:36	Wow.  
jaysonst	725384506690129922	2016-04-27T18:01:58	jayhaykid Stop introducing these "facts." They're just muddling the conversation.
jaysonst	725383995031195648	2016-04-27T17:59:56	All absolutely correct. But it's so much easier to ignore the big picture! 
jaysonst	725383609952178177	2016-04-27T17:58:24	Great point. Although Barry was really more a product of the '90s. But ego wasn't invented in 2010! 
jaysonst	725382920765071361	2016-04-27T17:55:39	Back in the trivia biz next week! 
jaysonst	725373731015692288	2016-04-27T17:19:08	Isn't it legal to appreciate players of all styles? And if you don't like one star, you can still love the sport 
jaysonst	725373114046156800	2016-04-27T17:16:41	JenLada Right. Right. Don't know what got into me.
jaysonst	725373039496540161	2016-04-27T17:16:24	That's a great idea. Why doesn't everyone just send me a list. I'll start checking them off. 
jaysonst	725372815348776960	2016-04-27T17:15:30	Wait. Aren't you also part of that conspiracy to ignore him? 
jaysonst	725372002568118272	2016-04-27T17:12:16	andrewflanagan8 I'm sure it's happened. But great point!
jaysonst	725371836641480704	2016-04-27T17:11:37	Haha. I was just going to suggest that people read the Harper column before they vent!  
jaysonst	725371181231120384	2016-04-27T17:09:01	I've written about Miggy many times. I'll say this again. I wrote about Bryce Harper b/c he's got something to say 
jaysonst	725370684843634693	2016-04-27T17:07:02	He was talking about the stuff he did when he was 19 or 20. But that struck me too. 
jaysonst	725362169701752832	2016-04-27T16:33:12	The Phillies traded for Charlie Morton and paid him $8 million figuring he'd provide short-term rotation... 
jaysonst	725356557328891904	2016-04-27T16:10:54	I didn't write this as part of a national-media agenda. Wrote it b/c he's a great player with something to say. 
jaysonst	725353792431087618	2016-04-27T15:59:55	You really think that's what I'm saying? The world has changed. The other sports have changed. It's baseball's turn 
jaysonst	725353508795482112	2016-04-27T15:58:47	How many of those perceptions are based on stuff he did at 19? He had a lot to learn - about baseball &amp; life 
jaysonst	725351074996060164	2016-04-27T15:49:07	Completely disagree. Sorry. The outside world's perception of this guy doesn't match the reality of who he is now 
jaysonst	725350663803146240	2016-04-27T15:47:29	As I keep saying, he's grown up a lot. And this is the world. Other sports permit &amp; encourage shows of personality 
jaysonst	725347725773012992	2016-04-27T15:35:48	It's always been fun for me, too. But it's about connecting with his generation, not with those who already love it 
jaysonst	725347373904498688	2016-04-27T15:34:24	What's your definition of "showing up?" Genuine expressions of emotion don't qualify unless it gets personal 
jaysonst	725341438184153089	2016-04-27T15:10:49	He's grown up a lot. Even the commissioner called him the spokesman for his generation. This is happening, folks 
jaysonst	725340874176090116	2016-04-27T15:08:35	I'm the last guy who would ever call it boring/not fun. Read the piece. See what you think  
jaysonst	725340495195561984	2016-04-27T15:07:04	I'm sure I'll be hearing all day from people who think Bryce Harper is all about himself. Wrong! Baseball needs to change. And he gets it
jaysonst	725339492643688448	2016-04-27T15:03:05	Bryce Harper on Jose Bautista's bat flip. Surprise! He loved it. 
jaysonst	725338662028742656	2016-04-27T14:59:47	My column: Baseball's culture war is on &amp; guess who's turning into its 5-star general? It's Bryce Harper. Who else? 
jaysonst	725324987138228224	2016-04-27T14:05:27	The good news: Erik Kratz became the 1st position player to pitch this year. The bad news: Threw the wildest WP ever 
jaysonst	725160043377770496	2016-04-27T03:10:01	How can you forget Dan Uggla, a mere 5 years ago? 
jaysonst	725159658411954176	2016-04-27T03:08:30	This is an amazing commentary on both of them 
jaysonst	725153814379139072	2016-04-27T02:45:16	So TheCUTCH22 has hit as many HRs tonight (3) as the Braves have hit all season. Hard to believe I just typed that.

jaysonst	725073869028073473	2016-04-26T21:27:36	You read that I was in favor of 2 out of 3? Nope. I just wrote a piece about whether MLB would consider it last fall 
jaysonst	725052242416533506	2016-04-26T20:01:40	That's definitely the other area that needs streamlining. But the quest to get it right makes that hard 
jaysonst	725051726617841665	2016-04-26T19:59:37	That's actually why MLB didn't require quick challenges. It does avoid some challenges. But it adds dead time. 
jaysonst	725051460489121792	2016-04-26T19:58:33	That's not true. I'm not arguing for 2 of 3. And I'm still championing replay. Doesn't mean it can't work better 
jaysonst	725042663884492800	2016-04-26T19:23:36	Does he get extra points for losing a no-hitter on a hit that beat a shift? 
jaysonst	725034026914947072	2016-04-26T18:49:17	Still better to have it than not have it. And the average team only reviews 2-3 calls a week. It can't be perfect 
jaysonst	725033558390231040	2016-04-26T18:47:25	I'd award 2 challenges instead of one then. The idea was to get the big calls right. That can still happen. 
jaysonst	725030478080782336	2016-04-26T18:35:11	Why can't they still get the calls right if the manager has to make a quicker decision? 
jaysonst	725030235599716352	2016-04-26T18:34:13	That's absolutely the best system. But don't see it happening any time soon. 
jaysonst	725028228428107778	2016-04-26T18:26:14	Put the "instant" back in instant replay! It would be way more dramatic to do it this way, too. 
jaysonst	725023329229398016	2016-04-26T18:06:46	You can check each team with this Baseball Savant replay sihttps://baseballsavant.mlb.com/replay

jaysonst	725017048431075329	2016-04-26T17:41:49	Didn't get the vibe that Buster_ESPN agreed with my idea to speed up replay. Managers need to make quicker decision 
jaysonst	725016190779793409	2016-04-26T17:38:24	Working out well for everybody! 
jaysonst	725007595879174144	2016-04-26T17:04:15	As always I'm sure you'll agree with all these ratings! 
jaysonst	724998165879992320	2016-04-26T16:26:47	Tyler Collins would be well served to read these words from Soria and think them through. 
jaysonst	724971175000989696	2016-04-26T14:39:32	The Mariners ruined my favorite stat last night. They were the 5th team in the last 100 years to start a season with 9 wins by 9 pitchers
jaysonst	724966276079165442	2016-04-26T14:20:04	Zack Greinke allowed 19 runs all last season at Dodger Stadium (17 starts). He has given up 18 already in Arizona (three starts). Uh-oh
jaysonst	724764748181426176	2016-04-26T00:59:16	Neil Walker's crazy stat line: 7 HR but no doubles this year. Only Met who had a 7-HR, 0-2B April? Ron Swoboda... 
jaysonst	724759705202085888	2016-04-26T00:39:13	Not much change in time of game. I was surprised by that. The first week was slow. Picked up since then 
jaysonst	724727532101222406	2016-04-25T22:31:23	Just posted: MLB replays up 35 percent from this time in 2015. Sunday set record for most reviews in one day 
jaysonst	724721171023990788	2016-04-25T22:06:06	I doubt that. Check out the numbers vs that slider in this column. More strikeouts than balls put in play! 
jaysonst	724718247011082241	2016-04-25T21:54:29	I'm not sure there's anyone. No one in that group threw a slider that was 93-95 mph. Heard a little J.R. Richard 
jaysonst	724717967456505858	2016-04-25T21:53:22	Thanks, Ben!

jaysonst	724658312281772032	2016-04-25T17:56:19	As one of the Braves' people told me, he's always been a slow starter. 2.90 career ERA in April/May -- 1.13 after 
jaysonst	724650993397338112	2016-04-25T17:27:14	Anoter fun Syndergaard note: Against his "offspeed" stuff - 5 hits, 2 walks, 23 whiffs. Absurd! 
jaysonst	724650611728248832	2016-04-25T17:25:43	merynlos3708 As I've told many other people today, we use Inside Edge data. They have him topping at 99. But no doubt he gets it up there!
jaysonst	724645564944519168	2016-04-25T17:05:40	bcnyygaming Sure. I believe you. I've already tweeted like 20 times today to other people that I've noticed that he throws hard!
jaysonst	724628469158711296	2016-04-25T15:57:44	Another fun quote from the column. How can a guy throw 2 "offspeed" pitches over 90 mph? David Wright: “It’s offspeed compared to 100.”
jaysonst	724620683179900928	2016-04-25T15:26:48	NYYfan2442 It's a matter of who's clocking him. We use data from Inside Edge. I cite that in the piece. But true, he throws real hard!
jaysonst	724616309875572736	2016-04-25T15:09:25	metrbocker InsideEdgeScout epass17 The outcome is going pretty well for him, too! But my point is that no one has the stuff this guy has
jaysonst	724615075873603584	2016-04-25T15:04:31	Kevin Plawecki in the column: "The chest had its time of fame. Hopefully, we can move past that.” 
jaysonst	724611882632527872	2016-04-25T14:51:50	RattoCSN I learned everything I know from you!
jaysonst	724611743255814144	2016-04-25T14:51:16	Amazing numbers on that pitch too. So far more K's on the slider than balls put in play!  
jaysonst	724611419094786048	2016-04-25T14:49:59	He's got 9 at 99 mph according to InsideEdgeScout but hasn't hit 100 
jaysonst	724609853059002369	2016-04-25T14:43:46	Nugget from my column: Noah Syndergaard has thrown 23 pitches already at 100+ MPH. All other starters have zero! 
jaysonst	724609595352748032	2016-04-25T14:42:44	Column-The Mets on Synderaard. David Wright: "If you could build a pitcher in a video game he’s the guy you’d build” 
jaysonst	724592400795111426	2016-04-25T13:34:25	Last year Mat Latos allowed 7 ER in his 1st inning as a Marlin. At this rate (2 ER/4 starts) it'll take him 3 months to do that in Chicago
jaysonst	724584224389513216	2016-04-25T13:01:55	Terrific Lou Gehrig stories from The Diary of Myles Thomas,1927.  
jaysonst	724435213523132418	2016-04-25T03:09:48	jaysonst There are 5 non-September games in which 20 pitchers appeared. CLE-ARI in June 2014 is shortest of them. 
jaysonst	724435573956599812	2016-04-25T03:11:14	Good one. Pitchers all over the box score in that game  
jaysonst	724434149692575744	2016-04-25T03:05:35	Do we have a non-September record? That's what made this game today an all-timer. Rosters weren't expanded 
jaysonst	724433909514158080	2016-04-25T03:04:38	And it's not a September game. Those expanded rosters skew the record book on a regular basis 
jaysonst	724425248574177280	2016-04-25T02:30:13	That game went 16 innings. This game zipped along! Over in "only" 13 
jaysonst	724423815195975681	2016-04-25T02:24:31	I don't recall a game where 19 pitchers made it into the box scores. I'm guessing you're on that, too! 
jaysonst	724411624627548165	2016-04-25T01:36:04	THREE pitcher PHs on same day: August 5, 1937.  Wes Ferrell (Sens), Lynn Nelson (A's), Red Ruffing (Yanks).  baseball_ref

jaysonst	724410659706949637	2016-04-25T01:32:14	And BertDbacks said a few minutes ago that the Dbacks could have two pitchers hit in the 13th! Miller &amp; a PH 
jaysonst	724410366982275074	2016-04-25T01:31:05	And that doesn't even count the Ollie Perez bunt! 
jaysonst	724405420211724289	2016-04-25T01:11:25	Last time two pitchers had pinch hits on same day: 6/26/11, Clayton Richard &amp; Wade Davis.

jaysonst	724408913538506752	2016-04-25T01:25:18	Not sure which of these games was crazier. The game in Arizona or the game in D.C. But does it even matter anymore? 
jaysonst	724404658257690624	2016-04-25T01:08:23	WillHoenike We both need help!
jaysonst	724404434789371904	2016-04-25T01:07:30	Tremendous as always 
jaysonst	724404190827679745	2016-04-25T01:06:32	Were there fireworks after this Ollie Perez game too? 
jaysonst	724403779592970240	2016-04-25T01:04:54	You forgot to include words you typed! 
jaysonst	724403653491212288	2016-04-25T01:04:24	Great day for extra-inning heroics by pitchers showing up at the dish. Pinch hits for Ross &amp; Greinke - &amp; Ollie's bunt heard round the world
jaysonst	724378171039207424	2016-04-24T23:23:08	So they're now on pace to get wins from, what, 84 different pitchers this year? That would be a record 
jaysonst	724376908721491969	2016-04-24T23:18:07	Oliver Perez hadn't reached base, even on an E, since 5/4/10, when he drew a BB vs Anibal Sanchez. But he'll take that E-2 on a huge bunt
jaysonst	723982173556998146	2016-04-23T21:09:35	MattPark1 Make that Buffalo-Rochester. But it's still an official Who Knew classic
jaysonst	723981206967050240	2016-04-23T21:05:45	Who knew the most historic game in baseball today would be Syracuse-Rochester! 
jaysonst	723917421145395200	2016-04-23T16:52:17	Tremendous  
jaysonst	723905640238817280	2016-04-23T16:05:28	Really looking forward to seeing the great JerrySeinfeld tonight. I'll be rooting hard for a few Mets quips!
jaysonst	723880620431122432	2016-04-23T14:26:03	jaysonst And before you Cardinals fans &amp; Mets fans start typing your responses, yeah, I'm aware these are just his regular-season numbers
jaysonst	723879473796538368	2016-04-23T14:21:30	Sat morning reading: Jake Arrieta has allowed 7 ER in 3 months. He's 20-1, 0.86 since 6/21. He even tops Bob Gibson! 
jaysonst	723692938082000896	2016-04-23T02:00:16	Really interesting piece. 
jaysonst	723619159117074436	2016-04-22T21:07:06	One more time: Statement from Chris Colabello 
jaysonst	723605962783756289	2016-04-22T20:14:40	Stunner in Toronto. Chris Colabello suspended for 80 games, for an old-school East German doping agent (dehydrochlormethyltestosterone).
jaysonst	723605108928344064	2016-04-22T20:11:16	TheAdamSowder It's a Twitter trick. It's how you add an addendum to your own tweet. Feel free to steal that!
jaysonst	723601487499124736	2016-04-22T19:56:53	jaysonst &amp; let me remind you these are regular-season numbers only, because MLB doesn't combine regular-season &amp; postseason stats. Got it?
jaysonst	723601090881552384	2016-04-22T19:55:18	A nugget from my Jake Arrieta post: Allowed 7 ER - since August 1! We found 8 since then who allowed 7 in an inning! 
jaysonst	723597476758839296	2016-04-22T19:40:56	It's not the first time in history. But it's the first time in Phillies history! 
jaysonst	723582078919430144	2016-04-22T18:39:45	I looked this up at the time. No team had ever beaten the top 3 finishers in the Cy Young voting in one postseason 
jaysonst	723578046867886081	2016-04-22T18:23:44	I'm not "discounting" them. In baseball, postseason stats are never combined with regular-season stats. That's all. 
jaysonst	723574352420040704	2016-04-22T18:09:03	And I actually had the facts to prove it! 
jaysonst	723573961204715520	2016-04-22T18:07:30	balatsos22 tbalatsos13 I agree! Hahaha. Worth it for the Arrieta versus Bob Gibson comparisons alone!
jaysonst	723569642866765824	2016-04-22T17:50:20	My latest: Only when you compare Jake Arrieta to other pitchers - and Bob Gibson - can you see how great he's been 
jaysonst	723503626128252928	2016-04-22T13:28:01	jaysonst Our friends at eliassports looked it up. Vander Meer &amp; Arrieta. Only 2 who ever did this. unhittable
jaysonst	723342913812455424	2016-04-22T02:49:24	Right. It wasn't him, either. 
jaysonst	723341685976141825	2016-04-22T02:44:31	Heard of these guys! 
jaysonst	723341289958330368	2016-04-22T02:42:57	To all those nominating Warren Spahn, it's not him either. 
jaysonst	723339488882204672	2016-04-22T02:35:47	Nope. Lost 6 times between no-hitters. 
jaysonst	723338637337829376	2016-04-22T02:32:24	Not even close. Lost 7 times between no-hitters! 
jaysonst	723336696889139200	2016-04-22T02:24:42	That would be 0.87 for the season, and 0.65 over 17 regular-season starts since his last loss. 
jaysonst	723334293183827968	2016-04-22T02:15:09	They're all right answers! 
jaysonst	723333192749592578	2016-04-22T02:10:46	Attn. researchers: So Jake Arrieta has thrown 2 no-hitters since his last regular-season loss. Who besides Johnny Vander Meer has done that?
jaysonst	723332526803161088	2016-04-22T02:08:07	You're amazing, Kernels! 
jaysonst	723331405757972483	2016-04-22T02:03:40	Anybody digging for the video of that Detroit-Buffalo 18-0 no-hitter in 1884? 
jaysonst	723329627494715393	2016-04-22T01:56:36	So both Cy Youngs are pitching tonight. One has allowed 12 hits. The other has allowed zero? Baseball! 
jaysonst	723328951972696064	2016-04-22T01:53:55	Now kenbroo is lining up to get blamed for jinxing this one. I'm staying out of the way 
jaysonst	723326839427600385	2016-04-22T01:45:31	Yep. Inspired the Larry Andersen line: "This team does some of its best work between 2 and 5 a.m." 
jaysonst	723326515522494464	2016-04-22T01:44:14	Zack Cozart is now lined up to be the 27th out. He's the only Reds player left in the game with a higher batting average than Arrieta (.300)
jaysonst	723323644282310656	2016-04-22T01:32:50	Can't take him out. Need to keep his bat in the lineup. Has a shot to reach base 4 times! 
jaysonst	723323249120186369	2016-04-22T01:31:15	That was 1993, of course. Mitch Williams walkoff single. At 4:41 a.m. Can't believe you forgot!  
jaysonst	723321941264875520	2016-04-22T01:26:04	Now you can blame mitchgoldich if this gets broken up! Was hoping somebody would take me off this hook 
jaysonst	723258696080494593	2016-04-21T21:14:45	An article yesterday from jaysonst inspired this piece. Check out the difference having a good bullpen can make. 
jaysonst	723206038606868480	2016-04-21T17:45:30	Took a bye week. The Hall of Famers were out most of the week, and we couldn't match up schedules. Next week! 
jaysonst	723175579789365248	2016-04-21T15:44:28	Great to see that the commissioner has tossed his unwritten rule book in the shredder 
jaysonst	723129895824424967	2016-04-21T12:42:56	ICYMI Only one thing in the universe can't be figured out by computers - the Royals! And why? Now it can be told 
jaysonst	722991634737025024	2016-04-21T03:33:32	Went 1 for 3 while Carlton went hitless!  
jaysonst	722987606418554880	2016-04-21T03:17:32	So Peter Bourjos becomes the 1st Phillies position player since 1979 to hit 9th vs an NL team. And drives in the tying &amp; GW run. Of course!
jaysonst	722964300692779008	2016-04-21T01:44:55	Watch out Damaso! The Phillies leadoff BB-less streak is over -- thanks to an intentional walk from the Mets. 
jaysonst	722963505901522950	2016-04-21T01:41:46	Greatest Lucas Duda-mania note ever! 
jaysonst	722962710460133376	2016-04-21T01:38:36	Another great David Lough moment. He's just the 3rd man to get a hit off Jerry Blevins in his Mets career (opponents now 3 for 30)
jaysonst	722958938963087360	2016-04-21T01:23:37	Elias: First time in Mets history team has produced homers in back-to-back at-bats in three straight games.
jaysonst	722958183933698048	2016-04-21T01:20:37	OldHossRadbourn I'll lead this campaign!
jaysonst	722956049737633797	2016-04-21T01:12:08	I'll vote yes -- and let somebody prove us wrong. 
jaysonst	722952315737542658	2016-04-21T00:57:18	From ESPNStatsInfo - Since 8/24, the Mets have hit as many HR at Citizens Bank Park (29) as the Phillies! Except in 23 fewer games (33-10)
jaysonst	722949702014996480	2016-04-21T00:46:55	Might want to jot this down. Last A's pitcher to get a hit against another AL team: Catfish Hunter vs Angels 10/3/72 
jaysonst	722945918631186432	2016-04-21T00:31:53	That record could be in danger! 
jaysonst	722942257934913536	2016-04-21T00:17:20	Just got to witness the most exciting play in baseball. It's the old 3-1 play at first -- with Bartolo on the mound!
jaysonst	722937648101232641	2016-04-20T23:59:01	David Lough's 1B off Bartolo Colon was bigger than you thought. It means Phillies pitchers no longer have more hits (5) than Phillies LFs
jaysonst	722932802992230406	2016-04-20T23:39:46	Here you have the Mets trying to hit 4+ HR for the 3rd game in a row, for the 1st time in team history. So those overturned HRs are huge
jaysonst	722928392371220481	2016-04-20T23:22:14	It's Game 16. Phillies leadoff men still haven't drawn a BB. Think Odubel Herrera can break that streak? Bartolo Colon: one BB all season!
jaysonst	722911510167572480	2016-04-20T22:15:09	A little reading before dinner: Why do the Royals keep defying the projections? I got to the bottom of it! 
jaysonst	722911151143563265	2016-04-20T22:13:44	The Phillies had gotten shut out 3 games in a row when Carlton did it. So it wasn't a Moneyball phenomenon! 
jaysonst	722854867081932800	2016-04-20T18:30:04	Yes, yes, yes and yes. And that's not all! 
jaysonst	722850525360730112	2016-04-20T18:12:49	That's also right. But the projections build in a normal amount of injuries. If you're luckier, you "over-perform" 
jaysonst	722846171937439744	2016-04-20T17:55:31	You're exactly right. And the people who do these projections admit the process can't ever be perfect.  
jaysonst	722845749810110464	2016-04-20T17:53:51	No one simple reason they defy the projections. But when you ALWAYS win when you take a lead, that seems to work! 
jaysonst	722828954441097217	2016-04-20T16:47:06	Thanks, Russell! Is that command binding? 
jaysonst	722827360001662976	2016-04-20T16:40:46	One thing I found interesting is that the Royals have caused the "projectors" to consider whether to revise formulas

jaysonst	720680251530067968	2016-04-14T18:28:56	You've mostly got it. Just not the part that would require players to slide right at the bag. 
jaysonst	720679992460451840	2016-04-14T18:27:54	It's really the malicious slide that's the issue here. But that gray area just below it is what's causing issues 
jaysonst	720679589299777537	2016-04-14T18:26:18	From what I've heard, the players balked at that. Wanted more leeway in the spirit of competition 
jaysonst	720679392167534592	2016-04-14T18:25:31	There is no chance they get rid of the rule. There's definitely a chance it won't be enforced as rigidly 
jaysonst	720676923257536512	2016-04-14T18:15:42	That's what's so hard for umps to define. His feet were pointed toward the base even if he didn't slide at the base 
jaysonst	720676634064470016	2016-04-14T18:14:33	This is all happening in a matter of seconds. Read Hinch's quote in my column about everything Rasmus had to process 
jaysonst	720676229561638912	2016-04-14T18:12:57	Max_thePower You're misunderstanding this. When the ball is hit, there are times runner anticipates it going through, then has to adjust
jaysonst	720675630401105920	2016-04-14T18:10:34	That's exactly right. Not always running straight from 1B, either. Might anticipate going 1st to 3rd &amp; wider turn 
jaysonst	720674275791937536	2016-04-14T18:05:11	That's what was initially proposed. It was the players who wanted more leeway than that. 
jaysonst	720673804750626817	2016-04-14T18:03:19	You'll never have a sport where umpires have no judgement calls. What's tough here is that it's uncharted waters 
jaysonst	720671283583827968	2016-04-14T17:53:18	The violent slide will get called every time. It's calling the slides in that gray area that they need to figure out 
jaysonst	720670882713182209	2016-04-14T17:51:42	In his defense, he's been expressing many of the same concerns since spring training 
jaysonst	720670673937543168	2016-04-14T17:50:52	Look, you're right to a point. But there's no question the Utley play accelerated the path toward the new rule 
jaysonst	720670288631971840	2016-04-14T17:49:20	Totally agree. And from what I'm hearing, umpires have now been told that. So the Rasmus play had that effect 
jaysonst	720670049711845377	2016-04-14T17:48:23	Interesting you say that. It's clear they started with a simple concept, had trouble putting it into words 
jaysonst	720669733004189696	2016-04-14T17:47:08	SeeCress CliffCorcoran Another AJ Hinch quote in this piece I agree with: Players know they can't "blow up" the SS or 2B anymore.
jaysonst	720661446711971840	2016-04-14T17:14:12	Suggest you read Hinch's thoughtful take in the piece I wrote. There was no contact. And SS didn't attempt a DP. 
jaysonst	720661121229844481	2016-04-14T17:12:55	This rule is definitely tougher than the old rule. But it's the mandate to enforce it that's really different 
jaysonst	720660651463544832	2016-04-14T17:11:03	A.J. Hinch made a good point that didn't make the column. He thinks you can still "disrupt" a DP but not break it up 
jaysonst	720660206007513088	2016-04-14T17:09:16	For those who want to take another look at the play that reignited the Utley Rule debate, here's a link 
jaysonst	720659202797137921	2016-04-14T17:05:17	That's why this is more than a rule change. As Larry Bowa said in the column, it's a culture change 
jaysonst	720658918368796672	2016-04-14T17:04:09	It is. That's why I didn't explore the Bautista play in the column. Other than the Blue Jays, everyone agrees w/ it 
jaysonst	720658545142800386	2016-04-14T17:02:41	I did. He was careful not to make contact, though. But still unclear if that's always going to be enough 
jaysonst	720658364817141760	2016-04-14T17:01:58	Looks like a fun group - for a team that won 24 games all season! 
jaysonst	720658212270157824	2016-04-14T17:01:21	That's what all managers are now telling runners, until it's more clear how this rule will be called. No choice

jaysonst	720011841284530176	2016-04-12T22:12:54	The infield fly rule has to be called in the moment by an ump on the field. Can't be imposed after the fact. 
jaysonst	720007145668939776	2016-04-12T21:54:15	In the spring, skeptics wondered if Kenta Maeda would continue to get so many outs on pitches outside the zone. So far: 11 IP, 8 H, 0 R, 7 K
jaysonst	719981355866697728	2016-04-12T20:11:46	Doesn't look anything like the Cubs clubhouse I remember! 
jaysonst	719980795096625153	2016-04-12T20:09:32	Asked Pete Mackanin about it. Said it was such an odd play, everyone was confused. He wasn't aware IF fly was called 
jaysonst	719838327839567873	2016-04-12T10:43:25	Nomar Mazara has seen 36 pitches in his first nine plate appearances, and has four singles, a homer, a sac fly, and one swing-and-miss.
jaysonst	719942564758077441	2016-04-12T17:37:37	This is an amazing project. One of the coolest things ESPN has attempted. A recommended follow! 
jaysonst	719918383760695298	2016-04-12T16:01:32	We also talked about overreacting to the Mets, pinch-hitting for Ryan Howard &amp; the absurdity of the infield fly rule 
jaysonst	719917025905242113	2016-04-12T15:56:09	Kimbrel is the one closer in the game who, based on age &amp; career path, has a chance to be Mariano. But good luck! 
jaysonst	719904152244129792	2016-04-12T15:04:59	"Cubs fans could become hated by the end of the year!"  -Buster_ESPN to jaysonst  LISTEN:  
jaysonst	719916211304325120	2016-04-12T15:52:54	No. It just says he has to be able to catch the ball with ordinary effort. But I think that's implied at least! 
jaysonst	719897122443800576	2016-04-12T14:37:03	I was replying to a question about Mariano's longest streak. That's all. 
jaysonst	719896918936141825	2016-04-12T14:36:15	With runners in scoring position 
jaysonst	719889696415997952	2016-04-12T14:07:33	Let me tweak that. Mariano's longest streak of no HR with RISP was still 4 years. But it was 2003-06, not 2002-06.
jaysonst	719889509698117632	2016-04-12T14:06:48	How 'bout this. The first HR of Mariano's career came with RISP (first and third). Longest streak: 4 years (2002-06) 
jaysonst	719884907737165824	2016-04-12T13:48:31	You sure? It only went 448 feet! 
jaysonst	719884154263904256	2016-04-12T13:45:31	Yesterday's most amazing number: Chris Davis' HR vs. Craig Kimbrel was the first ever off Kimbrel with RISP. It only took 7 years &amp; 303 PAs!
jaysonst	719674292871512065	2016-04-11T23:51:36	It's theoretically possible for infield fly rule to be called even if an outfielder catches the ball. Rule says so 
jaysonst	719667891025682433	2016-04-11T23:26:10	That's the correct definition. Which is not to be confused with the correct call

jaysonst	719510038029725696	2016-04-11T12:58:55	And of course, the 2 guys who hit them both hit zero triples all last year! 
jaysonst	719275155428675584	2016-04-10T21:25:35	Then there's this. Arrieta is batting 1.000 and giving up zero runs. He's pretty good apparently

jaysonst	718821482319757313	2016-04-09T15:22:51	And then they did it 3 innings in a row. Of course they did!

jaysonst	718099584984158208	2016-04-07T15:34:17	I'm fascinated by Jose Fernandez's outing yesterday. 8th pitcher to K 13+ while facing just 23 hitters. Only other loss: Roger Nelson in '68
jaysonst	718088421114310656	2016-04-07T14:49:55	All the time. They've dropped nearly every other distinction between leagues (except DH). Why not that, too? 
jaysonst	718084902403620864	2016-04-07T14:35:56	In MLB's world, yes. In the trivia world, why would I be bound by that? 
jaysonst	718083792800505856	2016-04-07T14:31:32	I've had some people questioning why Holliday is one of the answers. Split 2009 between A's &amp; Cards, but was .313, 24 HR altogether
jaysonst	718083313622196229	2016-04-07T14:29:37	His longest streak was 2 in a row 
jaysonst	718082684145246208	2016-04-07T14:27:07	OK let me clear this up. We did have 6 players hit 20+ with a .300 AVG last year. But no current player has a streak dating before last year
jaysonst	718080067168051201	2016-04-07T14:16:43	Want to watch Espngreeny &amp; bomani_jones get my trivia wrong? Or want to relive the moment? Here goes

jaysonst	717909515274993667	2016-04-07T02:59:01	Maybe the Padres need more pitchers in their lineup 
jaysonst	717908969239371776	2016-04-07T02:56:51	Cool note from EliasSports - David Ortiz became the 2nd 40+-year-old in history to HR in his team's 1st 2 games. The other: Ted Williams
jaysonst	717890969178390529	2016-04-07T01:45:19	The Phillies last year when they led after 7: 51-3. The Phillies this year when they've led after 7: 0-2. This bullpen is really that shaky.
jaysonst	717875685025558533	2016-04-07T00:44:35	Agreed. Tremendous piece of writing  
jaysonst	717819146562625537	2016-04-06T20:59:55	danieltkelley This was supposed to be a reply to a Cano tweet. Sorry for the confusion.
jaysonst	717818783755341826	2016-04-06T20:58:29	OK, just to make those last 2 tweets clear, Elias says Trevor Story is the first player since 1900 whose first 4 career hits were all HRs
jaysonst	717818338223775744	2016-04-06T20:56:42	So Robbie isn't so spectacular compared to that!
jaysonst	717818255528726528	2016-04-06T20:56:23	How bout of a career? Trevor Story has just done that. Elias says he's the first ever. I'm about to tweet it

jaysonst	717531363482734592	2016-04-06T01:56:22	Sadly, no. Scored one two years ago. He'll be as proud of this one as that one, though.  
jaysonst	717488625739558914	2016-04-05T23:06:33	I'm sure I could find one! They're both elite right now. But Syndergaard is just getting started. Unreal stuff  
jaysonst	717487215744573441	2016-04-05T23:00:57	Believe it. We looked at the data to make sure. Threw it very little before September 
jaysonst	717487083737186304	2016-04-05T23:00:25	Because we should have a Clayton Kershaw Award and then a Cy Young for everyone else. Way too easy to pick him 
jaysonst	717486945925001216	2016-04-05T22:59:52	Might be the hardest throwing starter in baseball. Definitely the hardest slider of any starter in baseball  
jaysonst	717486022620266496	2016-04-05T22:56:12	Noah Syndergaard (my Cy Young pick) got 6 strikeouts on his slider today. Only got 11 all last season. Very Chris Archer-like today
jaysonst	717480773826297856	2016-04-05T22:35:21	Plus what no one reading it factors in is that it's being written at like 3 in the morning! 
jaysonst	717480679446093824	2016-04-05T22:34:58	I don't think that was meant to be taken literally. Just imagining what happens after the Paige shot if it goes OT 
jaysonst	717480491830607873	2016-04-05T22:34:14	No! Heck, he might not give up a run for another month. Last year allowed 7 earned runs in first 6 starts combined! 
jaysonst	717461045992882177	2016-04-05T21:16:57	We also talked about our Opening Day impressions: Royals, David Wright, Giants lineup, Daniel Murphy &amp; Trevor Story! 
jaysonst	717459806659993600	2016-04-05T21:12:02	That was Marcus Paige's projection, right? Of course he thought that!

jaysonst	717205359010713600	2016-04-05T04:20:57	This was more dramatic.  
jaysonst	717205113723609092	2016-04-05T04:19:58	That was historic. This was better.  
jaysonst	717204349185888257	2016-04-05T04:16:56	OK I'm throwing this out there after thinking about it for a half hour. Greatest finish in Philadelphia sports history? Gotta be

jaysonst	715958917499600897	2016-04-01T17:48:02	Agreed. Think about Josh Donaldson, Russell Martin, Tulo, Marcus Stroman, etc. Winners. 
jaysonst	715958659482783744	2016-04-01T17:47:00	I don't think they have the prospect base to make that sort of move this year -- and a different front office! 
jaysonst	715958387721240577	2016-04-01T17:45:56	Read the column. Then I'll say, "You're welcome." They don't need me dropping my prediction curse on them. 
jaysonst	715958197023023105	2016-04-01T17:45:10	Jays outscored the Orioles by 178 runs last year! So yes 
jaysonst	715957947692687360	2016-04-01T17:44:11	I think there's a definite chance that Bautista returns. But it will have to play itself out down the road, not now 
jaysonst	715957695816318978	2016-04-01T17:43:11	As I said, I'm not predicting anything that has the Cubs &amp; the World Series in the same sentence. But I'd watch! 
jaysonst	715957514739847169	2016-04-01T17:42:28	And 300 more strikeouts!

jaysonst	715957197394599937	2016-04-01T17:41:12	I picked Blue Jays over Giants. All our predictions are right here btw  
jaysonst	715956898294603776	2016-04-01T17:40:01	Depends which metrics you use in the "who's better" debate. But they catch it all over the field. Can't debate that 
jaysonst	715956604508700672	2016-04-01T17:38:51	It's never easy with pitchers that good. It's hard to back off them today in the name of tomorrow. 
jaysonst	715956288908353536	2016-04-01T17:37:35	The question was which teams have zero shot. No way the A's are at zero. 
jaysonst	715956058078973953	2016-04-01T17:36:40	They're definitely 1-2 to start the season. Love the up side of both guys. The question is managing their innings 
jaysonst	715955812473171968	2016-04-01T17:35:42	I have, actually. My best pick ever was the 2004 Red Sox. Should have retired from predicting right there

jaysonst	715955313820631041	2016-04-01T17:33:43	PhillyB322 Yep. The Phillies. BB Prospectus played the season a million times. The Phillies won the WS zero times. 
jaysonst	715954978406445059	2016-04-01T17:32:23	Here's how I mean that: Not saying they don't have egos. But there's a collective commitment to be great - as a team

jaysonst	715952473073184768	2016-04-01T17:22:25	I don't know how much better they can be offensively. But they're still the best lineup in the game. That'll work 
jaysonst	715944402049433600	2016-04-01T16:50:21	I spared the Cubs from being subject to my WS prediction curse! But luckily, the Blue Jays aren't worried!

jaysonst	714564106729209856	2016-03-28T21:25:33	Phillies checked in on long list of OFs this spring. But teams speaking to them say they seem out of that market after signing Will Venable
jaysonst	714554023622361088	2016-03-28T20:45:29	Very strange story. 
jaysonst	714540633667608576	2016-03-28T19:52:17	Pete Mackanin tried to downplay talk that just-signed Will Venable has guaranteed big-league spot: "We just want to see what he looks like"
jaysonst	714521051288506368	2016-03-28T18:34:28	Phillies sign OF Will Venable to a minor-league deal, but at this point, it would be a surprise if he didn't make their big league team.

jaysonst	694596657892200450	2016-02-02T19:02:02	Has a cap stopped tanking in the NBA? Not even a lottery has stopped it. 
jaysonst	694577217683247105	2016-02-02T17:44:47	Disagree actually. The rules create incentive to lose because your draft pool is much bigger  
jaysonst	694576866292846592	2016-02-02T17:43:24	Lots of you in the Twitterverse debating fine line between tanking &amp; "rebuilding." I asked Rob Manfred about that!

jaysonst	693523977348718592	2016-01-30T19:59:35	They're not outliers. They're in a great spot, a spot any team would prefer. Still better to have great starters 
jaysonst	693453609003028480	2016-01-30T15:19:58	I didn't count that one. But good point! 
jaysonst	693451234422984704	2016-01-30T15:10:32	The Yankees weren't the only team to keep their closer &amp; add a closer this winter. 7 teams did that! I smell a trend

jaysonst	693172073468956672	2016-01-29T20:41:15	Bill James compares this to having one man run a marathon vs. a series of sprinters run it. Who'd run it faster? 
jaysonst	693139366005346304	2016-01-29T18:31:17	Of course. But teams no longer feel that having 5 starters eating innings is the only way to win.

jaysonst	693138362857820160	2016-01-29T18:27:18	It must have just seemed that way. Indians starters worked deeper into games than any other rotation. 
jaysonst	693138158087725057	2016-01-29T18:26:29	And that's just what these teams have in mind! 
jaysonst	693137902763667456	2016-01-29T18:25:28	Relying on pitching in general is a gamble, because pitchers get hurt so much. But starters much more than relievers 
jaysonst	693137678867521537	2016-01-29T18:24:35	Another astounding bullpen stat: Teams made more than 15,000 pitching changes in '15. Most ever. And up 600 from '14 
jaysonst	693137508876587012	2016-01-29T18:23:54	A bullpen stat to chew on: 2015 was first season in history in which the AVERAGE team went to its bullpen 500 times! 
jaysonst	693137086824734720	2016-01-29T18:22:14	I wrote a lot about how data has played into this historic era of bullpen use. And the answer is: In a huge way! 
jaysonst	693136702936842242	2016-01-29T18:20:42	That's definitely one of the morals. Easier to put together a great bullpen. Cheaper. Healthier. And it works! 
jaysonst	693136525090013184	2016-01-29T18:20:00	And the Nasty Boys before that. But if you read the piece, it'll be obvious the whole sport is getting bullpen-crazy

jaysonst	687290460084240384	2016-01-13T15:09:49	Time for another Jerry Dipoto transactions update: 11 trades involving 35 players, 5 free agents, 7 minor-league FAs, 4 waiver claims. Phew!
jaysonst	686986832672894976	2016-01-12T19:03:19	Actually had a longtime exec tell me recently it wouldn't shock him if the Marlins won the NL East. Seriously! 
jaysonst	686986328446210048	2016-01-12T19:01:18	Guilty! 
jaysonst	686974249949597696	2016-01-12T18:13:19	I noticed that! 
jaysonst	686967614862659584	2016-01-12T17:46:57	The heck with "people." When will the computers believe in them? 
jaysonst	686967382980562946	2016-01-12T17:46:01	It's never fun to be that wrong. But I'm guessing Royals fans want an official apology from the computers too! 
jaysonst	686967177212260356	2016-01-12T17:45:12	Good luck on that! The masses don't seem in a mood to be soothed 
jaysonst	686965438769659904	2016-01-12T17:38:18	Those run-differential numbers btw are the difference between last year's run diff &amp; this year's projections 
jaysonst	686965284855504897	2016-01-12T17:37:41	Most unimproved teams by projected fangraphs run diffs: Blue Jays -192, Royals -105, Cardinals -94, Pirates -78 
jaysonst	686965033964802049	2016-01-12T17:36:41	Most improved teams by projected fangraphs run diff: Red Sox +109, Tigers +99, Mariners +97, White Sox +79 
jaysonst	686943926566154240	2016-01-12T16:12:49	Another projection that got my attention: Cardinals projected to allow 134 more runs -- &amp; drop by 16 wins! 
jaysonst	686943295860305921	2016-01-12T16:10:19	Also interesting in this projection: Brewers, Phillies, Tigers &amp; Blue Jays at the bottom in run prevention. Tigers? 
jaysonst	686940289659998210	2016-01-12T15:58:22	Might achieve some ratings points with that one! 
jaysonst	686938667844263936	2016-01-12T15:51:55	Uh-oh. Here we go again. In the first fangraphs projection of the 2016 standings, the Royals are pegged at 79-83 
jaysonst	686676354696351752	2016-01-11T22:29:35	I agree there's a Boras effect. He's only gotten Pelfrey, Drew &amp; Oliver Perez signed. No Davis, Chen, Jackson, Rios 
jaysonst	686676015725281281	2016-01-11T22:28:14	Of course not. It's common sense in some cases. It's just business in others. 
jaysonst	686674728556335105	2016-01-11T22:23:07	It's a combination of things. But basically, big spenders not spending - &amp; not-so-big spenders waiting for bargains. 
jaysonst	686654828148342790	2016-01-11T21:04:03	I think Cespedes is holding up the market more than Davis is. But some of this has nothing to do with either of them 
jaysonst	686654569561100289	2016-01-11T21:03:01	JeffSprunger Haven't polled 400 of them! Seems split between running out of slots on ballot and weighing almost 200 fewer games/.saves
jaysonst	686650525488644096	2016-01-11T20:46:57	It's Jan 11 -- but 7 of the top 15 in the keithlaw top 50 free-agent list still haven't signed. One exec called it "almost unheard of."
jaysonst	686588121996259329	2016-01-11T16:38:59	If you liked our 2016 ballots (or not), we've got more! Here are ESPN's very preliminary 2017 Hall of Fame ballots

jaysonst	685175680665964544	2016-01-07T19:06:26	From what I gather the email went out to all members, not just those with ballots. At least you knew not to respond! 
jaysonst	685172608782987264	2016-01-07T18:54:14	NotMrTibbs ahall0007 So there's vitriol out there. Goes with the territory. In sports, we disagree. That's the fun of it!
jaysonst	685171948595343361	2016-01-07T18:51:37	ahall0007 NotMrTibbs susanslusser Just to clear this up, I checked. And no ballot from Bob Smizik was ever posted on the BBWAA site
jaysonst	685169945278287872	2016-01-07T18:43:39	cjmills82 He's mentioned in my column!

jaysonst	685157425406685184	2016-01-07T17:53:54	Where was the indication in these results that the PED stigma will "die?" Especially for a guy suspended for a year 
jaysonst	685157030508785669	2016-01-07T17:52:20	Good point. But Correa is younger. And pitchers are more likely to get hurt. Nevertheless long way to go! 
jaysonst	685156557097701376	2016-01-07T17:50:27	So you're saying a couple of guys who didn't have a vote still got the email - &amp; had fictional ballots on the site?

jaysonst	685141289063563264	2016-01-07T16:49:47	Which 3 players had their HOF chances improve the most since last election day? The answer (and more) in my column

jaysonst	685137465062088705	2016-01-07T16:34:35	This is confusing. So JeffFletcherOCR - can you clear this up?

jaysonst	685134928703557633	2016-01-07T16:24:30	rjfisher72 Explained it in my column yesterday. Just couldn't justify putting him in my top 10

jaysonst	685130401891921921	2016-01-07T16:06:31	Too early to say. A more complete view tomorrow when the BBWAA releases ballots for those who agreed to go public 
jaysonst	685115325608771584	2016-01-07T15:06:37	Did you know we just missed having 3 position players elected by BBWAA for 1st time since 1954? Only 2 other times: '39 &amp; 1st election ('36)

jaysonst	685114703937441792	2016-01-07T15:04:08	Thought I'd pass along some leftover Hall of Fame tidbits in advance of my next column. 185 of the 440 voters used all 10 spots (42 percent)
jaysonst	684888429516206081	2016-01-07T00:05:00	Think our man Tim Raines can find those 23 missing votes in a year? Looks like you do!

jaysonst	684878947176296448	2016-01-06T23:27:20	I didn't bother calculating that. We had 109 fewer voters than last year. 
jaysonst	684878544682532864	2016-01-06T23:25:44	He did. Only got 11 votes. Needed 22 to stay on the ballot. One of the worst one-and-dones of modern times. 
jaysonst	684878262695235584	2016-01-06T23:24:36	Jeff Bagwell missed by 15 votes, Tim Raines by 23 votes. Could have been the first year ever that the writers elected 4 position players
jaysonst	684877630106144769	2016-01-06T23:22:06	Only 2 players on the ballot actually dropped in percentage: Gary Sheffield (down 0.1 pct) and Nomar Garciaparra (down 3.5 pct &amp; off ballot)

jaysonst	684875521302335488	2016-01-06T23:13:43	The biggest jumps by percentage: Mussina (up 18. 4 pct), Edgar (up 16.4), Bagwell (up 15.9), Raines(up 14.8), Schilling (13.9)
jaysonst	684873975026024448	2016-01-06T23:07:34	It'll be fascinating to hear the reasoning of the 3 voters who didn't vote for Griffey -- assuming they're willing to identify themselves
jaysonst	684873659622797313	2016-01-06T23:06:19	Griffey was named on all but 3 ballots, the highest pct ever.
jaysonst	684873435839901698	2016-01-06T23:05:26	Ken Griffey &amp; Mike Piazza are your 2 Hall of Famers. A near-miss for Jeff Bagwell.
jaysonst	684871269188145152	2016-01-06T22:56:49	Calling it. The pre-results period of balloting is over. We finish at 213/estimated 47.3%. 
jaysonst	684871448993918976	2016-01-06T22:57:32	True. That's why people like Buster_ESPN stopped voting. If the rule costs a guy a vote, it takes 3 to even it out 
jaysonst	684865331668606976	2016-01-06T22:33:13	A half-hour left till we learn the results of the HOF election. But still time to read how &amp; why I cast this ballot! 
jaysonst	684857228738822144	2016-01-06T22:01:02	I have no problem with any context they want to add. Put it on the plaques. Hang signs in the gallery. Fine with me

jaysonst	684850821029335041	2016-01-06T21:35:34	Respectfully disagree. Lots of research to show that modern players are least-represented in HOF in history 
jaysonst	684843909650878464	2016-01-06T21:08:06	I'm a fan of the dgoold proposal. A YES box and a NO box next to every name. Just vote yes or no. Solves it all

jaysonst	684794358093221888	2016-01-06T17:51:12	Exactly right. That's the only question we should be trying to answer as voters. Instead, it's now ballot management 
jaysonst	684794164433825792	2016-01-06T17:50:26	Of course not! They're invaluable. But do you think we should just check off every name on the JAWS leader board? 
jaysonst	684793496486674432	2016-01-06T17:47:47	Didn't get the memo saying closers aren't eligible. Has anyone but me noticed Wagner has best WHIP in live-ball era?
