AnnaHolmes	696811566323335168	2016-02-08T21:43:18	BenjaminFMoser So have a lot of ppl. Rebecca, for example. And Joan Walsh. And Sady Doyle. (I can go on.) And they’re saying something diff
AnnaHolmes	696811319018835969	2016-02-08T21:42:19	BenjaminFMoser I’m not accusing BS/GG/MT of making gendered attacks at HRC. I am accusing the latter 2 of pooh-poohing attacks on HRC fans
AnnaHolmes	696811104622788610	2016-02-08T21:41:28	BenjaminFMoser you keep saying this. and i keep responding that SOME of them are at HRC and others are being directed at her SUPPORTERS
AnnaHolmes	696810921243582464	2016-02-08T21:40:44	BenjaminFMoser I can send you some pieces that detail this if you like. Might help answer your question.
AnnaHolmes	696810799399043073	2016-02-08T21:40:15	BenjaminFMoser have you only been paying attention to this issue for the past three days?
AnnaHolmes	696810684949098496	2016-02-08T21:39:48	BenjaminFMoser No I did not. What I saw, however, was GG delegitimizing the that gendered attacks by progressives were/are a unique problem
AnnaHolmes	696810283948515328	2016-02-08T21:38:12	BenjaminFMoser being on the receiving end of gendered attacks and insults
AnnaHolmes	696810211655417860	2016-02-08T21:37:55	BenjaminFMoser and you know what/ this happened the LAST time she ran. why is this so surprising?
AnnaHolmes	696810125445746688	2016-02-08T21:37:34	BenjaminFMoser attacking her bc they disagree with her policies and her history. there are ppl attacking HRC fans in v. gendered ways
AnnaHolmes	696810045791674369	2016-02-08T21:37:15	BenjaminFMoser there’s more nuance here than you are allowing for. there’s ppl attacking HRC bc she is a woman, yes. there are ppl
AnnaHolmes	696809954590781441	2016-02-08T21:36:53	BenjaminFMoser And do you concede that maybe you don’t see it because you’re not looking hard enough?
AnnaHolmes	696809732552712192	2016-02-08T21:36:00	BenjaminFMoser Who do u think is better equipped to identify &amp; articulate sexism coming from supposed progressives if not women GETTING IT
AnnaHolmes	696809542219407361	2016-02-08T21:35:15	BenjaminFMoser or, “Well I know so and so personally, he could never be capable of…” it’s not really a strong counterargument
AnnaHolmes	696809409868079104	2016-02-08T21:34:44	BenjaminFMoser when women relate their literal LIVED EXPERIENCES with sexism and the response is, “Yeah, but”...
AnnaHolmes	696809164614582272	2016-02-08T21:33:45	BenjaminFMoser without resorting to things like: 1) well people are horrible everywhere! or 2) BHO got nasty stuff said to him as well!
AnnaHolmes	696809029046267905	2016-02-08T21:33:13	BenjaminFMoser I don’t understand why it is seemingly so difficult to take the complaints about gendered attacks seriously
AnnaHolmes	696808838855528448	2016-02-08T21:32:27	BenjaminFMoser and maybe that will change if/after HRC wins the nomination. HOWEVER, that’s not what ppl have been pointing out
AnnaHolmes	696808758496911360	2016-02-08T21:32:08	BenjaminFMoser it’s an entirely different matter when most attacks against identity seem to be coming from one’s OWN SIDE
AnnaHolmes	696808628653846529	2016-02-08T21:31:37	BenjaminFMoser But I think it’s safe to say large majority of racist attacks on BHO over past 9 yrs have been from the right
AnnaHolmes	696808571904901122	2016-02-08T21:31:24	BenjaminFMoser Of course some did! I didn’t say they didn’t.
AnnaHolmes	696808375942823936	2016-02-08T21:30:37	BenjaminFMoser No thanks. I’ve seen what the tenor of his responses is like and I don’t find the idea productive
AnnaHolmes	696807885381226496	2016-02-08T21:28:40	BenjaminFMoser Because a lot of the sexism being directed at HRC is coming from SUPPOSED political and ideological allies that’s why
AnnaHolmes	696807574956597249	2016-02-08T21:27:26	BenjaminFMoser Maybe! But I’m not responding to what Bill “Foot in mouth” Clinton said.
AnnaHolmes	696807142658023425	2016-02-08T21:25:43	BenjaminFMoser It’s not even remotely the same thing
AnnaHolmes	696807051016667136	2016-02-08T21:25:21	BenjaminFMoser yeah but most of those attacks on Obama are not coming from ppl who identify as liberals or progressives
AnnaHolmes	696806865733296128	2016-02-08T21:24:37	BenjaminFMoser But I don’t see anyone who is serious-minded in these discussions tarnishing Bernie.
AnnaHolmes	696806740436918273	2016-02-08T21:24:07	BenjaminFMoser I would be happy to point to all the instances believe me
AnnaHolmes	696806551756083203	2016-02-08T21:23:22	BenjaminFMoser His tone deafness on this matter was on sustained display in that Intercept piece
AnnaHolmes	696806462857814016	2016-02-08T21:23:01	BenjaminFMoser But this, apparently, is not enough “proof” for you, or GG, and many others.
AnnaHolmes	696806349909401600	2016-02-08T21:22:34	BenjaminFMoser what female writers and pundits have said repeatedly is that there is a specific and viciously gendered tenor to attacks
AnnaHolmes	696806216962609153	2016-02-08T21:22:02	BenjaminFMoser I’m not defending Steinem/Albright/Bill.
AnnaHolmes	696806137685999617	2016-02-08T21:21:43	BenjaminFMoser Steinem, Albright and Bill came along after GG wrote piece &amp; after the majority of complaints about Bernie fans were lodged
AnnaHolmes	696805851437383686	2016-02-08T21:20:35	BenjaminFMoser Whether or not you know Glenn personally has very little to do with whether or not he can be tone deaf on gender politics
AnnaHolmes	696805620800974850	2016-02-08T21:19:40	BenjaminFMoser I’m not critiquing Sanders’ record on women’s issues. I’m critiquing the tenor of some of his supporters online to HRC fans
AnnaHolmes	696805389015371777	2016-02-08T21:18:45	BenjaminFMoser I’d agree with you here but you’re arguing against a point neither I nor Rebecca ever made.
AnnaHolmes	696805243795939328	2016-02-08T21:18:10	BenjaminFMoser I’m not sure why it’s so difficult to imagine that two progressive dudes might have exhibited tone deafness on gender
AnnaHolmes	696804874554580992	2016-02-08T21:16:42	BenjaminFMoser IT DOES! And you know what? I think they do too.
AnnaHolmes	696804804878823425	2016-02-08T21:16:26	BenjaminFMoser I think his piece for the Intercept the other week about “Bernie Bros” did not take the issue very seriously, no
AnnaHolmes	696804678584180736	2016-02-08T21:15:56	BenjaminFMoser Per this, which is you arguing against a strawman. 
AnnaHolmes	696804434458890241	2016-02-08T21:14:57	BenjaminFMoser I agree with you. And where did RT or any other person say that all critiques of her are motivated by misogyny?
AnnaHolmes	696804307551784960	2016-02-08T21:14:27	BenjaminFMoser and if you meant to say that GG and MT aren’t capable of misogyny I’d take issue with that too
AnnaHolmes	696804155852193793	2016-02-08T21:13:51	BenjaminFMoser I think RT is right. Also saying that they are not interested in misogyny is not the same as saying they are MOTIVATED by it
AnnaHolmes	696802531394129921	2016-02-08T21:07:24	BenjaminFMoser Who said they were motivated by it?
AnnaHolmes	696763592708878336	2016-02-08T18:32:40	RobertJMccoy1 ChloeAngyal Actually, what I "got" is more like, "I'm a man who doesn't take many women's lived experiences seriously."
AnnaHolmes	696739164776198145	2016-02-08T16:55:36	crushingbort kept_simple you can take that difference of opinion up with her if you like. sorry - have to go.
AnnaHolmes	696739084845318144	2016-02-08T16:55:17	crushingbort kept_simple u weighed in with screengrab in which RT said she didn’t think HRC was alluding to/calling for BHO’s murder
AnnaHolmes	696737901225316354	2016-02-08T16:50:35	kept_simple crushingbort I’m done. I have to work. Not to be rude but this isn’t going anywhere. I get yr POV but I don’t agree with it.
AnnaHolmes	696737652830314496	2016-02-08T16:49:35	kept_simple crushingbort No. SHE brought it up and then you weighed in on it like you knew anything about it!
AnnaHolmes	696737201506406400	2016-02-08T16:47:48	kept_simple crushingbort So yeah, it does feel like a derail
AnnaHolmes	696737093654081536	2016-02-08T16:47:22	kept_simple crushingbort You say you were commenting on her tweet yet we’ve spent past 20 min discussing analysis of racism in her book
AnnaHolmes	696736987852705793	2016-02-08T16:46:57	kept_simple crushingbort we’re talking past one another I think.
AnnaHolmes	696736449086038016	2016-02-08T16:44:48	kept_simple crushingbort convenient side-stepping of her point - WHICH MANY OTHERS HAVE BEEN MAKING - and that doesn’t sit well with me
AnnaHolmes	696736347336351744	2016-02-08T16:44:24	kept_simple crushingbort have been initiated by ppl other than RT? If you want to delegitimize RT go right ahead. But it’s also a
AnnaHolmes	696736166905847810	2016-02-08T16:43:41	kept_simple crushingbort I do have one question: Why this focus on race baiting BHO when the discussion re: sexist attacks towards HRC
AnnaHolmes	696735167508017153	2016-02-08T16:39:43	kept_simple crushingbort And I would also say you should read the book in its entirety
AnnaHolmes	696735100898246657	2016-02-08T16:39:27	kept_simple crushingbort Fair enough. I don’t think she IGNORED them, though. I think she didn’t proffer opinions on them that you like.
AnnaHolmes	696733008951447552	2016-02-08T16:31:08	kept_simple crushingbort As in: if u think analysis of racism in '08 not rigorous enuf doesn’t mean analysis of sexism now is illegitimate
AnnaHolmes	696732884904886272	2016-02-08T16:30:39	kept_simple crushingbort No.
AnnaHolmes	696732177275490304	2016-02-08T16:27:50	crushingbort kept_simple Probably bc I don’t buy your underlying premise of honesty vs. dishonesty in analysis
AnnaHolmes	696731624474591232	2016-02-08T16:25:38	kept_simple crushingbort But this then means that she can’t have an “honest” analysis of sexism towards HRC? Nah, I am not buying that
AnnaHolmes	696731508682448897	2016-02-08T16:25:10	kept_simple crushingbort So you don’t like her opinions in that book or think it was rigorous enough. Fine!
AnnaHolmes	696731404562993153	2016-02-08T16:24:46	kept_simple crushingbort yes, alongside sexism in a series of tweets about sexism towards HRC. I’m not sure what your point is
AnnaHolmes	696730548312662017	2016-02-08T16:21:22	crushingbort kept_simple In fact, I think it’s a weird way to change the subject
AnnaHolmes	696730402833227776	2016-02-08T16:20:47	crushingbort kept_simple Right, and I don’t think that yr dislike of her book or opinions invalidates her point about sexism towards HRC
AnnaHolmes	696729227530526720	2016-02-08T16:16:07	kept_simple crushingbort you don’t see the point or you don’t find it legitimate
AnnaHolmes	696729033938231296	2016-02-08T16:15:20	crushingbort kept_simple What’s lacking, IMO, is a response to RT pointing out sexism with "‘BUT WHAT ABOUT HRC RACISM AGAINST OBAMA"
AnnaHolmes	696728370126712833	2016-02-08T16:12:42	crushingbort kept_simple This is a pivot away from what she was tweeting about today, which was sexism directed at Hillary
AnnaHolmes	696728160369582080	2016-02-08T16:11:52	crushingbort kept_simple Also, if you want to push back against Rebecca’s opinions I suggest you direct your criticism TO her
AnnaHolmes	696727882383626241	2016-02-08T16:10:46	crushingbort kept_simple yes, but without acknowledging the fact that she also included differing viewpoints
AnnaHolmes	696727386713427968	2016-02-08T16:08:48	crushingbort kept_simple here's the rest of that section of the book you failed to note: 
AnnaHolmes	696722570746454016	2016-02-08T15:49:40	kept_simple I don’t understand what your critique is, then
AnnaHolmes	696722160077905921	2016-02-08T15:48:02	TimRussoCLE Sorry. The minute you put the word sexism in scare quotes is the minute you marked yourself as unserious. Have a good day.
AnnaHolmes	696722004846780417	2016-02-08T15:47:25	TimRussoCLE rtraister You’re suggesting she cannot think critically nor for herself.
AnnaHolmes	696721814509248513	2016-02-08T15:46:39	When you put the word sexism in scare quotes... 
AnnaHolmes	696721333011509249	2016-02-08T15:44:44	I think that your accusation that rtraister is being paid off by the Clinton campaign suggests you are unserious. 
AnnaHolmes	696720835575418881	2016-02-08T15:42:46	kept_simple She was describing the parts of the book that most closely pertain to the particular point she is making, today.
AnnaHolmes	696720576069693440	2016-02-08T15:41:44	Yeah. Exactly.  
AnnaHolmes	696720538270617600	2016-02-08T15:41:35	kept_simple I’m not trying to “get” you. But it’s not very rigorous to make an accusation like the one you did without having read book.
AnnaHolmes	696720281948332032	2016-02-08T15:40:34	When men take women seriously.  
AnnaHolmes	696719453707505664	2016-02-08T15:37:16	kept_simple Because if you had you’d know that discussion of racist attacks against Obama - from the Dem/left - is IN THE BOOK
AnnaHolmes	696719191659958272	2016-02-08T15:36:14	kept_simple Have you read rtraister’s book?
AnnaHolmes	696718213082718208	2016-02-08T15:32:21	kept_simple she’s talking about what her book Big Girls Don’t Cry is about.
AnnaHolmes	696718091699560453	2016-02-08T15:31:52	kept_simple saying what?
AnnaHolmes	696716285539938304	2016-02-08T15:24:41	8. Then I am afraid you are serving as exhibit A.
AnnaHolmes	696716220918321152	2016-02-08T15:24:26	7. But if u really believe you have invalidated the argument that the left has women issues simply by discovering that I made it in 08...
AnnaHolmes	696716100701188096	2016-02-08T15:23:57	6. It's all about sexism/racism/classism in 2008 (toward HRC, Michelle O, Palin) much of it from the left.
AnnaHolmes	696715902889431041	2016-02-08T15:23:10	5. These are indeed patterns I write about, alas, over &amp; over again. You can read more about them in my first book: 
AnnaHolmes	696715825957441536	2016-02-08T15:22:51	4. To suggest feminist critique is invalid be it was leveled similarly 8 years ago shows huge lack of comprehension of how sexism works.
AnnaHolmes	696715601792933890	2016-02-08T15:21:58	3. This argument is in &amp; of itself a pretty telling embodiment of a progressive lack of interest in/respect for feminist commentary.
AnnaHolmes	696715517629984769	2016-02-08T15:21:38	2. Their inference: the argument that there's misogyny tied up in reactions to HRC must not be true bc I wrote about it last time she ran.
AnnaHolmes	696715401154183168	2016-02-08T15:21:10	1. So mtaibbi &amp; GlennGreenwald tweeted piece I wrote in 08 re sexism from progressives w one I wrote this year re sexism from progressives

AnnaHolmes	696694969831178240	2016-02-08T13:59:59	Yup. What’s your point? 
AnnaHolmes	696689448352931841	2016-02-08T13:38:03	Yes it's as though sexism on the left were still a thing.

AnnaHolmes	694405630598213632	2016-02-02T06:22:58	krucoff it doesn’t make you a bad feminist! :)
AnnaHolmes	694403995490783233	2016-02-02T06:16:28	krucoff and i’m sorry to make you the focus of my irritation right now but i see this stuff over and over again and it’s not rigorous.
AnnaHolmes	694403777466597376	2016-02-02T06:15:36	krucoff i’m tired of this idea that ppl who are pro-hillary never criticize her - only someone who isn’t *paying attention* would say that
AnnaHolmes	694403481050968064	2016-02-02T06:14:25	krucoff and if you want to see this sort of critique, I suggest you just read more widely because it is THERE
AnnaHolmes	694403143178850305	2016-02-02T06:13:05	krucoff in the same way you shouldn’t put words in my mouth
AnnaHolmes	694403076803936256	2016-02-02T06:12:49	krucoff Then I think you should be SPECIFIC ABOUT IT.
AnnaHolmes	694402989520470016	2016-02-02T06:12:28	krucoff Fine. But if you’re going to make accusations (that ppl say criticism of hillary is antifeminist, or that frogs don’t critique her)
AnnaHolmes	694402769818615808	2016-02-02T06:11:36	krucoff what I find irritating is you made broad claims/generalizations that, when I pushed back on them, you didn’t have evidence for
AnnaHolmes	694401886917677056	2016-02-02T06:08:05	krucoff And has it occurred to you that perhaps someone(s) of "anyone" have done or are doing just that?
AnnaHolmes	694401438894678017	2016-02-02T06:06:19	krucoff No. I'm not. Because if I was saying that...I'd just fucking SAY THAT.
AnnaHolmes	694400831865626624	2016-02-02T06:03:54	krucoff who? writers? People on Twitter? Her surrogates?
AnnaHolmes	694400699162050562	2016-02-02T06:03:22	krucoff you can't agree that women need to be in more positions of political power and then say..."but not THAT one"
AnnaHolmes	694400230951903232	2016-02-02T06:01:31	krucoff responses from who?
AnnaHolmes	694400087867461633	2016-02-02T06:00:56	krucoff for one thing: part of the feminist project is having *more women in positions of political power*
AnnaHolmes	694398837969018880	2016-02-02T05:55:58	krucoff NAMELY, that there are enough "people" who say criticism of her is "anti-feminist" to validate your earlier tweet
AnnaHolmes	694398629835116545	2016-02-02T05:55:09	krucoff huh? I'm not arguing w/you as to whether Hillary should be criticized - I'm pushing back against what that criticism MEANS
AnnaHolmes	694397120414105600	2016-02-02T05:49:09	krucoff hence my query of you about it bc I would like to disabuse you of the notion that that's a "thing"
AnnaHolmes	694396979443548160	2016-02-02T05:48:35	krucoff also the "people think any criticism of Hillary is anti-feminist" is a strawman that's been trotted out a lot recently
AnnaHolmes	694396647934148608	2016-02-02T05:47:16	krucoff you said a "growing overlap" and "people who" which reads to me like you're identifying a trend
AnnaHolmes	694395933895856129	2016-02-02T05:44:26	krucoff well I don't know her but i would caution you against making conclusions about "people" based on how you interpret your mom's POV
AnnaHolmes	694395073388265472	2016-02-02T05:41:01	krucoff does your mom really believe that any criticism of Hillary is misogynist? Or is she just saying that a fair bit of it is gendered
