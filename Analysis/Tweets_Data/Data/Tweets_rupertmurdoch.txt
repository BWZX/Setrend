rupertmurdoch	705710730448932864	2016-03-04T11:05:24	Consider comparative  primary turnouts for Republicans and Democrats.  natesilver not such good prediction record these days.
rupertmurdoch	705686972052930560	2016-03-04T09:30:59	If Trump nominated some Republicans may stay home, but not nearly as many Dems already abstaining or crossing over!
rupertmurdoch	705369781092782080	2016-03-03T12:30:35	UK Brexit campaign gathers force as government makes obviously false claims aimed at scaring voters. Early days yet.
rupertmurdoch	705134886324215808	2016-03-02T20:57:12	As predicted, Trump reaching out to make peace with Republican "establishment".  If he becomes inevitable party would be mad not to unify.
rupertmurdoch	704029598808301568	2016-02-28T19:45:11	UK Labor so hopeless ruling Tories indulge in tearing each other apart over Europe..  Dangerous, even if started by Cameron.
rupertmurdoch	704028770697523201	2016-02-28T19:41:53	Both "establishment" Republicans and Trump need to cool it and close ranks to fight real enemy.  Trump, Rubio, Kasich could all win general.
rupertmurdoch	704028082424819712	2016-02-28T19:39:09	NYT fawning story about Hillary and Libya fails to mention resulting state of country today and rise of ISIS there.
rupertmurdoch	700851101856206849	2016-02-20T01:14:58	Congratulations Michael Gove.   Friends always knew his principles would overcome his personal friendships.
rupertmurdoch	700849050845782016	2016-02-20T01:06:49	Pope was wrong, but Trump moved fast to make peace!   Bet he changes tone but not policy if still winning most states by mid-March.
rupertmurdoch	700847718466396160	2016-02-20T01:01:31	Tomorrow's polls. If Trump beats Cruz by ten plus or Rubio runs 2nd it's over for Cruz. And if Sanders beats Hilary in Nev curtains for her.
rupertmurdoch	700414464575680512	2016-02-18T20:19:56	Trump blames me for WSJ poll, fights FoxNews. Time to calm down.  If I running anti-Trump conspiracy then doing lousy job!
rupertmurdoch	698651228654284800	2016-02-13T23:33:27	Great reads in WSJ:  Charles Murray on Trumps' America and Juan Williams on pandering in the Carolinas..  Great reminders of our problems.
rupertmurdoch	698611791811575808	2016-02-13T20:56:45	Tonight's  audience in S.C.  Probably rigged by party establishment.   Repeating old tricks from previous elections.
rupertmurdoch	698286006194274304	2016-02-12T23:22:12	Is Hillary scared of something?  Endlessly eulogises Obama while whole world knows of their intense mutual antipathy.
rupertmurdoch	698280553230024705	2016-02-12T23:00:31	Sadly UK's Independent print paper closes after about 30 years.  Any loss of diversity bad.
rupertmurdoch	698277835618852864	2016-02-12T22:49:44	US race relations bad enough without Clinton, Sanders trolling for black votes trying to criminalise cops.  Worst type of pandering.
rupertmurdoch	698214258002300928	2016-02-12T18:37:05	New S.C. Poll has Trump 36-19 Cruz.  Great brawl coming, plus second one between mutual hating "moderates".
rupertmurdoch	698189382315044864	2016-02-12T16:58:15	Soft left softball from Clinton donor Woodruff, last night's CNN-PBS non-debate.
rupertmurdoch	697473707485302784	2016-02-10T17:34:24	Chris Christie, suicide bomber.  Damages victim while blowing himself up!
rupertmurdoch	697244979262070787	2016-02-10T02:25:31	Hillary speech awful point after point.  Eg, better education but against charters, rein in Wall St which she will never do, etc.
rupertmurdoch	696319231005237248	2016-02-07T13:06:56	All really failed to understand immensity of global Muslim problem.  No easy answers, but Middle East just a forerunner to sub-Sahara Africa
rupertmurdoch	696318074237095937	2016-02-07T13:02:20	Christie the tough bullying prosecutor. Not much on big issues.  Kasich the safe moderate, everyone's Vice President.  Carson also best yet.
rupertmurdoch	696317116560121860	2016-02-07T12:58:32	Cruz a great debater performed well, but why do all long-term acquaintances distrust him?  Jeb Bush best yet.  Easily visualise him in WH.
rupertmurdoch	696315619780751360	2016-02-07T12:52:35	Trump better, somewhat contained and more presidential.    Rubio inspirational speaker, a winner.  But does he have real depth of knowledge?
rupertmurdoch	696315103063494657	2016-02-07T12:50:32	All candidates lifted game last night.   Everyone seemed better than alternative Dems.

rupertmurdoch	696127275989921792	2016-02-07T00:24:10	Cameron's EU non-deal shocks UK opinion.  Now he's rumoured to be begging cabinet colleagues to put aside beliefs.
rupertmurdoch	696125838165680129	2016-02-07T00:18:27	Do Obamas really want Hillary to win?
rupertmurdoch	696125317568708608	2016-02-07T00:16:23	Of course Hillary's agent sought top dollar fees.  Why lie?   What she told Wall St friends IS relevant and we will never be told.
rupertmurdoch	695972479593013249	2016-02-06T14:09:04	Watch Hillary's candidacy sink and sink.  Nobody buying and more big trouble coming on emails.  Dems looking for replacement.  John Kerry?
rupertmurdoch	695296374234046464	2016-02-04T17:22:28	Hillary:"When I took those speaking fees I did not know I would be running for president!"   Oh yeah!!
rupertmurdoch	695245960675512320	2016-02-04T14:02:08	Cameron's deal with EU a nothing.   How can sensible Cabinet colleagues accept this?  Loyalty to country more important than friendships.
rupertmurdoch	694598884090322944	2016-02-02T19:10:53	Huge night for Rubio.   Plenty of room for Trump to come back while Cruz will be a big factor in South.  Now a real three horse  race.
rupertmurdoch	694116089635147777	2016-02-01T11:12:26	UK-EU negotiations meaningless without complete control of borders.  Must be able to choose immigrants.
rupertmurdoch	693803103812993024	2016-01-31T14:28:44	Hillary email troubles get really serious.    WH has surprising alternates if things get worse.
rupertmurdoch	693526371411304449	2016-01-30T20:09:06	Hillary email breaches get very serious, even though certain Russia, China, Israel had the server hacked full time for years.
rupertmurdoch	693081968263716864	2016-01-29T14:43:12	No Trump allowed several to shine.   Especially Bush, Rubio, Rand Paul.   Polls will be interesting, but Donald's figures near unassailable.
rupertmurdoch	692838611511685121	2016-01-28T22:36:11	Republican candidates must be looking forward to tonight's debate.   Speaking without Donald getting all attention.  Aim for independents.
rupertmurdoch	692380508907507712	2016-01-27T16:15:51	Google has cleverly planted dozens of their people in White House, Downing St, other governments. Most brilliant new lobbying effort yet.
rupertmurdoch	692379810455252992	2016-01-27T16:13:05	Tech tax breaks facilitated by politicians easily awed by Valley ambassadors like Google chairman Schmidt eg, posh boys in Downing St.@
rupertmurdoch	692378707915337730	2016-01-27T16:08:42	Global tech companies making enormous profits most places, funnelling $$ thru tax havens. Unless stopped will ruin local businesses who pay.
rupertmurdoch	692377314018119681	2016-01-27T16:03:10	Google et al broke no tax laws.  Now paying token amounts for p r purposes. Won't work. Need strong new laws to pay like the rest of us.
rupertmurdoch	692376567192915968	2016-01-27T16:00:12	This is Bloomberg's last chance.   You never know until your hat is  in the ring!  Events change everything, especially during elections.
rupertmurdoch	690981583189192704	2016-01-23T19:37:01	Allegedly Bloomberg again considering running.   If he does, may hurt Clinton more than Trump.  Seems 2016 the year for populists.

rupertmurdoch	688160582592118784	2016-01-16T00:47:22	Cruz bets uniting white conservatives/evangelicals enough,   Meanwhile Trump appealing across party lines.  Surely the winning strategy.
rupertmurdoch	688159680619622400	2016-01-16T00:43:47	24 hours and many influential Republicans see Trump inevitable and get ready to switch.  United by horror of Hillary whose campaign staggers
rupertmurdoch	687835115322392577	2016-01-15T03:14:05	GOP debate.  All candidates do well, Rubio and Trump most effective.  Cruz brilliant debater, but what else?  Like ability still important!
rupertmurdoch	687779491091984384	2016-01-14T23:33:03	Another big debate tonight.  Thanks Roger Ailes again for another great production. Keep 'em coming better and better than competitors.
rupertmurdoch	687121446435291136	2016-01-13T03:58:13	O speech proclaims great virtue of Iran nuclear deal. Tomorrow's headlines: "Iran grabs ten US sailors"!
rupertmurdoch	687115264354168833	2016-01-13T03:33:39	Where to start on Obama speech?   Sounded mostly great, but totally divorced from reality.  Both US and world.  Sad.
