brianbeutler	725815565173047296	2016-04-28T22:34:50	brianbeutler right. ignorance wasn't the issue. it was "bomb a country I have no reason to want to bomb because it doesn't exist"
brianbeutler	725815091761827840	2016-04-28T22:32:57	If conservatives had supported increasing foreign aid to Agrabah instead of bombing it, there would've been way less sneering.
brianbeutler	725814990997839873	2016-04-28T22:32:33	Based on that contrast, liberal sneering is vindicated.
brianbeutler	725814696654180352	2016-04-28T22:31:23	The relevant contrast lies in the revealed reflexes: conservatives for bombing brown people, liberals for tolerance of refugees.
brianbeutler	725814521147727872	2016-04-28T22:30:41	That a bunch of liberals responded as if Agrabah was a real country, too, doesn't prove liberals are just as sneer-worthy as conservatives.
brianbeutler	725814322555842561	2016-04-28T22:29:54	Sneering wasn't about geography per se but about anti-Arabism being so reflexive that conservatives supported bombing a fictional country.
brianbeutler	725814164384444416	2016-04-28T22:29:16	It's kinda funny that anyone thought Agrabah was a country, but think RameshPonnuru mischaracterizes the incident.

brianbeutler	725430937706745856	2016-04-27T21:06:28	That Fiorina speech was mostly fine, but I really objected to the part where she said she has to keep Cruz alive to harvest his brain.

brianbeutler	720655142362693632	2016-04-14T16:49:09	lfreedmanUSSC there’d be no tension here, IMO, if abortion/sodomy rights were affirmed on equal protection grounds, rather than due process
brianbeutler	720654884186505216	2016-04-14T16:48:08	lfreedmanUSSC those arguments do apply, the question is how principled they were in the first place.

brianbeutler	720651066048688128	2016-04-14T16:32:57	takethepith I’m conflicted on the question, but Cruz’s position isn’t equivalent to “sex toys are bad and should be banned."
brianbeutler	720650907705352195	2016-04-14T16:32:20	takethepith Translated: courts shouldn’t be able to void masturbation-related legislation, because masturbation isn’t an enumerated right.
brianbeutler	720649961545863173	2016-04-14T16:28:34	FWIW, my views on this aren’t absolute or unconflicted.
brianbeutler	720648331786104832	2016-04-14T16:22:05	Not exactly. Neither was Cruz. He was pro-right of state legislators to ban sex toys, let horny voters vote them out 
brianbeutler	720646488318152705	2016-04-14T16:14:46	2. And if you agree with the (my) argument in that piece, the logical conclusion is that you should side with Cruz.
brianbeutler	720646065121308672	2016-04-14T16:13:05	1. Cruz’s dildo ban defense is actually an funny incarnation of the jurisprudence debate I wrote about last summer.

brianbeutler	719958942944792576	2016-04-12T18:42:42	Other point is, this is a big part of why I’m more inclined to give Ryan the benefit of the doubt this time. 
brianbeutler	719958080239333376	2016-04-12T18:39:17	ashuppy right?! This would be double-murder/suicide when he has a perfectly easy path to continued power.
brianbeutler	719957630580625412	2016-04-12T18:37:29	Point is, Ryan’s probably considered this beyond fanfic/Sorkinesque scenarios, and gets how chaotic and dangerous to his career it would be.
brianbeutler	719956978487947265	2016-04-12T18:34:54	Nothing more fun than running for President in a party that can’t agree on a legislative leader with a government shutdown deadline looming.

brianbeutler	719956162167324672	2016-04-12T18:31:39	Maybe Ryan sees this coming and announces intent to resign the Speakership in July, creating a leadership vacuum in the House. Even better!
brianbeutler	719955569654808578	2016-04-12T18:29:18	Suddenly, there would be renewed clamor on the right to depose the House Speaker…who also happens to be the GOP presidential nominee.
brianbeutler	719955349613240320	2016-04-12T18:28:26	…despite being a modest measure, he will have just “stolen” the nomination from Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.

brianbeutler	719955026077200384	2016-04-12T18:27:08	Around September 30, he’d be responsible for something many GOPers consider a fireable offense: funding government on a bipartisan basis.

brianbeutler	714855817112129537	2016-03-29T16:44:42	ibflorea yes, Trump would be a bad president. But he’s occasionally less ridiculous than his opponents, because he’s not a dogmatist.

brianbeutler	714854951084769281	2016-03-29T16:41:16	Despite it all, Trump has occasional moments of great clarity that make NeverTrump conservatives appear foolish.

brianbeutler	714478377281957888	2016-03-28T15:44:54	But Trumpism, as opposed to Donald Trump the human person, is an immense, rich, terrifying story, and inspiring a lot of great writing, too.

brianbeutler	714476998031241216	2016-03-28T15:39:25	Trump’s weird public persona lends itself to a lot of lazy analysis, especially the kind that squeezes him into a typical partisan framework
brianbeutler	714475973912182786	2016-03-28T15:35:21	But the *fact* that millions find him appealing, and have forged a genuine political bond with him, is an explosive and fascinating one.
brianbeutler	714475742738956290	2016-03-28T15:34:26	To the extent that Trump himself is an interesting character at all, it’s in determining why millions of people find him appealing.

brianbeutler	713566526822031360	2016-03-26T03:21:32	yeselson but so much of Limbaughism is affected. In a way, should be possible to drive that element out in a "party decides" kind of way.

brianbeutler	713565795926847490	2016-03-26T03:18:37	yeselson But nothing focuses the mind like three blowout presidential election defeats in a row.
brianbeutler	713565730206326785	2016-03-26T03:18:22	yeselson yep. Very tall challenge. Difficult to formulate a process by which it happens.
brianbeutler	713565522709889024	2016-03-26T03:17:32	yeselson the hardest part (if realignment is possible) will be the party's imperative to disavow D'Souzaism en masse.
brianbeutler	713564947519815680	2016-03-26T03:15:15	yeselson I hear you, but think a lot of the rage is diffuse, projected on them by radio/Fox/other charlatans. But current GOP enables that.
brianbeutler	713564191068667906	2016-03-26T03:12:15	yeselson ScottMcConnell9 again, not convinced I'm right. But much more open to possibility of a realignment than despairing conservatives.

brianbeutler	713563304854163456	2016-03-26T03:08:43	yeselson ScottMcConnell9 as you know, I think that's a big component of it, but...
brianbeutler	713562970152968192	2016-03-26T03:07:24	yeselson ScottMcConnell9 the error here, I think, is in assuming Trump's support is *entirely* nativist.
brianbeutler	713562757589651456	2016-03-26T03:06:33	yeselson point is, I think Ross's otherwise great column yesterday was too pessimistic/unimaginative about possibility of reorientation.
brianbeutler	713562296128245760	2016-03-26T03:04:43	yeselson could also imagine reorientation around religious devotion/family formation that scraps supply side doctrine.
brianbeutler	713561833035153408	2016-03-26T03:02:52	yeselson no denying it'll be a long, bitter process, but (and as Dems move left) wonder if there isn't a TRULY center-right might compete.

brianbeutler	712997477524381696	2016-03-24T13:40:20	The media, by contrast, are totally to blame for letting Trump use their large platforms as infomercial stages.
brianbeutler	712996952376475648	2016-03-24T13:38:14	The problem, as always, is there are still millions of misogynists and people who are OK with misogyny, and many vote in the same primary.

brianbeutler	712815471888896000	2016-03-24T01:37:06	Quite a document. 
brianbeutler	712814709792194561	2016-03-24T01:34:04	“Judge Garland is just the kind of candidate we would have advised President Bush to nominate.”

brianbeutler	712812918539206656	2016-03-24T01:26:57	The reason is that Republican voters like Trump quite a lot more than they like the other candidates. 
brianbeutler	712799140263104512	2016-03-24T00:32:12	Really enjoyed speaking with jelani9 and JohnJHarwood today. Two great conversations to share with you on prime_concerns tomorrow.

brianbeutler	712725851457064961	2016-03-23T19:40:59	DouthatNYT DKThomp Ryan just brought it back. His real innovation was getting universal GOP buy in to it.

brianbeutler	710935320041287681	2016-03-18T21:06:03	The actual problem is that you might misinterpret them, like say by reading "Trump is bad" as "Hillary is good." 
brianbeutler	710933513290309632	2016-03-18T20:58:52	Telepathic connection to Trump gives Zaid a leg up on the rest of us who must assess him using lame textual analysis 
brianbeutler	710930264554344448	2016-03-18T20:45:58	Sanders fans are understandably reading below as comment on the primary. It's about the general, per linked podcast. 
brianbeutler	710929187419398144	2016-03-18T20:41:41	When primary's over, I look forward to reading about how Clinton would be just as bad for Muslim Americans as Trump.

brianbeutler	710920778162823168	2016-03-18T20:08:16	TJRaphael 18-29 is the cohort pollsters look at. I agree 29 y/os have more political memory of W than 18s, who were 11 when he left office.

brianbeutler	710917988451483648	2016-03-18T19:57:11	JonathanCohn ByYourLogic yes, but there is some concern that it might carry over.
brianbeutler	710912980318343169	2016-03-18T19:37:17	JonathanCohn ByYourLogic to the contrary, it's precisely the issue under discussion in the link I tweeted.
brianbeutler	710912770192101376	2016-03-18T19:36:27	JonathanCohn ByYourLogic it was about how unfortunate it could be if the young voter problem she has now carries into the general.
brianbeutler	710912509298020352	2016-03-18T19:35:24	JonathanCohn ByYourLogic podcast I linked to said nothing about preferring her over sanders. I fully understand sanders' appeal over hers.
brianbeutler	710912170494705664	2016-03-18T19:34:04	JonathanCohn ByYourLogic good*
brianbeutler	710912109287186433	2016-03-18T19:33:49	JonathanCohn ByYourLogic noting Bush's awfulness as a reason to prefer Clinton isn't to embrace her full record or even think she's goods
brianbeutler	710911547288260608	2016-03-18T19:31:35	JonathanCohn ByYourLogic yes, and also that in areas where she and Bush didn't overlap, his record is far more awful than hers.

brianbeutler	710856914930892800	2016-03-18T15:54:30	Great stuff here. Particularly the point about how the SCOTUS docket will shift w/o the conservative majority.  
brianbeutler	710857782136799232	2016-03-18T15:57:57	jbouie thanks!
brianbeutler	710857649915600897	2016-03-18T15:57:25	So, I guess what I’m trying to say is, ThanksObama!
brianbeutler	710857570966175744	2016-03-18T15:57:06	To the point where you see it deployed in ways that undermine its own supposed purpose.
brianbeutler	710857422911442945	2016-03-18T15:56:31	Blaming Obama was so pervasive these seven years, such a critical way to keep the conservative worldview sorted, that it became atavistic.
brianbeutler	710857236625629184	2016-03-18T15:55:46	But dragging Obama into this doesn’t unify. It drives the wedge deeper.
brianbeutler	710857170124939264	2016-03-18T15:55:31	Obviously the shattering of a political movement is going to elicit searching, denial, etc.
brianbeutler	710857092006060033	2016-03-18T15:55:12	To implicate Obama compounds the problem, because many see Trump as a solution to Obama, not as somehow complicit with him.
brianbeutler	710856989862141952	2016-03-18T15:54:48	To treat Trump as an object of blame is to imply that millions of your allies are participating in something bad.
brianbeutler	710856922958790657	2016-03-18T15:54:32	That logic doesn’t apply to Trump, though, because the phenomenon they’re assigning blame for arose within the GOP.
brianbeutler	710856724715012097	2016-03-18T15:53:44	Anger at the other party’s leaders is great motivator; being responsible for something bad is huge drain on enthusiasm.
brianbeutler	710856631047864320	2016-03-18T15:53:22	Assign blame for the bad, claim credit for the good. Obama did Benghazi. Obama did wage stagnation. Obama did Ebola. Dumb, but obvious.
brianbeutler	710856239761256451	2016-03-18T15:51:49	Obviously I'm not surprised about the general reflex. And of course sometimes it’s correct. But it usually reflects obvious political logic.
brianbeutler	710855920390164481	2016-03-18T15:50:33	There’s something revealing to me about the unthinking way some conservatives attribute Trump’s rise to Obama.

brianbeutler	710151208477073408	2016-03-16T17:10:16	At this point, Trump would need to win about 53% of remaining GOP delegates to win 1,237. At his current clip, that's highly achievable.

brianbeutler	710112145275527169	2016-03-16T14:35:03	nicholas_bagley right but that assumes Obama wasn't sensitive to the imperatives of the people on his list.
brianbeutler	710111304602750976	2016-03-16T14:31:42	I should add that I have no idea whatsoever if that's what happened.
brianbeutler	710111184490516480	2016-03-16T14:31:14	Which is to say that the "right" move here may have been too cynical to get buy in from a risk-averse professional with SCOTUS ambitions.

brianbeutler	710105636739129344	2016-03-16T14:09:11	Trump grew out of a toxic mix of rejection and defeatism of which he's both the apotheosis and the promised remedy. 
brianbeutler	710101635200995328	2016-03-16T13:53:17	Great point by brianbeutler: The GOP is failing to admit how Trumpism is their own fault  
brianbeutler	710100455536369665	2016-03-16T13:48:36	Guess the campaign was beset by, the arc was shaped by, but what's Twitter for if not passing off horrifying mixed metaphors as profundity?
brianbeutler	710099774683357184	2016-03-16T13:45:53	Rubio saw Trump as a fad, then a fear monger, then a comic, and finally a menace–but one the GOP bears no blame for. 
brianbeutler	710094111114698752	2016-03-16T13:23:23	The arc or Rubio's campaign was beset the whole way by the GOP's stubborn inability to see Trumpism for what it is. 
brianbeutler	710090892275748864	2016-03-16T13:10:36	No one will ever be more reform-oriented than Rubio, the most orthodox of candidates. This is sad addict behavior. 
brianbeutler	710083330142646272	2016-03-16T12:40:33	.brianbeutler perfectly shows how Rubio's loss signals GOP's refusal to acknowledge Trump as uniquely its problem

brianbeutler	708298666071687168	2016-03-11T14:28:56	Politics is a long-con for every pol. Trying to attack Trump as a con man opens up attack to how they are all cons

brianbeutler	708297419117694976	2016-03-11T14:23:58	In November, when the GOP writes off Trump as a fluke who scammed the base, remember last night, when they...forgot.

brianbeutler	708160923299504128	2016-03-11T05:21:35	My colleague brianbeutler on how the GOP is retreating from anti-Trumpism: 
brianbeutler	708160226898251781	2016-03-11T05:18:49	.brianbeutler writes good things. You should read them. Here is one. 
brianbeutler	708160546055426049	2016-03-11T05:20:05	It WAS the strongest field in a generation. The bar was just a little low. 
brianbeutler	708158904123809797	2016-03-11T05:13:34	File tonight away for November, when Republicans try to disclaim Trump as a con man who swindled the base. 
brianbeutler	708157844307050496	2016-03-11T05:09:21	Tonight Republicans forgot how to say "con man." When Trump loses in November—to avoid a reckoning—they'll remember. 
brianbeutler	708151700096307202	2016-03-11T04:44:56	Exactly right.  
brianbeutler	708131091975118848	2016-03-11T03:23:03	Rubio as belligerently ignorant about climate change as Trump has been about anything during this campaign.

brianbeutler	708133195758366725	2016-03-11T03:31:25	brianbeutler no, but the other instances have been weak or narrow. This was much better
brianbeutler	708131583618899972	2016-03-11T03:25:00	People act shocked about the lack of policy knowledge on display in the GOP 2016 debates but this is *exactly* what Bush's persona was like.
brianbeutler	708131382220836864	2016-03-11T03:24:12	Rubio’s climate answer presumes countries can’t solve collective action problems—an intuition he may have gained in failing to defeat Trump.
brianbeutler	708130947770785793	2016-03-11T03:22:29	Rubio's answer would make at least some sense if there weren't massive international effort going on to solve the problem he's describing
brianbeutler	708130859665068034	2016-03-11T03:22:08	Of course, I made a typo :-/

brianbeutler	708130341802749953	2016-03-11T03:20:04	Is this the first time the entire campaign the Republican candidates have been asked about climate change?
brianbeutler	708125614377664513	2016-03-11T03:01:17	Rubio would break from modern US policy history by openly opposing a negotiated settlement between Israel and Palestinians.
brianbeutler	708125648674545665	2016-03-11T03:01:25	Wait these Rubio remarks on Islam people were praising are insane.
brianbeutler	708124553000562688	2016-03-11T02:57:04	Cruz’s “Ayatollah Khamenei wants nuclear weapons to murder us” quip is the “smoking gun/mushroom cloud” line of this debate.

brianbeutler	708119388776300545	2016-03-11T02:36:33	The collective action problem that has bedeviled the GOP this entire campaign manifesting now/again as universal reluctance to attack Trump.

brianbeutler	708117994824540161	2016-03-11T02:31:00	Evergreen tweet.  
brianbeutler	708116798244200449	2016-03-11T02:26:15	Interesting Trump tack to say opposition to cutting Social Security a sensible counterpoint to Dems who want to increase benefits.
brianbeutler	708116343480909824	2016-03-11T02:24:27	After Marco Rubio has been a lobbyist for 25 years, his plan will afford him no Social Security benefits.

brianbeutler	708114540966354945	2016-03-11T02:17:17	Trump confirms Carson endorsement on debate stage.
brianbeutler	708114196219580416	2016-03-11T02:15:55	I want to see Presidential Trump take incoming, but this version should scare Rubio, Cruz..and Democrats.
brianbeutler	708113802034855937	2016-03-11T02:14:21	None of these candidates appear to know how the H1-B process actually works. It's a lottery!

brianbeutler	708113416242593792	2016-03-11T02:12:49	Are we back to the Jeb-era where nobody’s willing to attack Trump?
brianbeutler	708113293253054464	2016-03-11T02:12:19	Would be great if Cruz could say “I oppose TPP because it’s not a free trade deal” but he’s sadly half pregnant, out of wedlock.
brianbeutler	708112846517772288	2016-03-11T02:10:33	But at a gut level, I imagine his “I’ll turn my greed outward for America” line has broad appeal.
brianbeutler	708112573317550081	2016-03-11T02:09:28	If Trump had any real ideas for making trade more fair, his point about taking advantage of current law wouldn’t be so eye-roll inducing.

brianbeutler	707950359432601600	2016-03-10T15:24:53	The most important takeaway, of course, is I have a podcast, and you should subscribe to it.

brianbeutler	707943053592494080	2016-03-10T14:55:51	So the goal of this podcast was to shed light on what the political work of marginalizing these forces (Fox, Limbaugh etc) looks like.

brianbeutler	707770419365941248	2016-03-10T03:29:52	michaelbd TPCarney but as all three of us know, "Benghazi" is only ever invoked in debate as ghoulish, exploitative conspiracy nonsense.
brianbeutler	707769240644919296	2016-03-10T03:25:11	michaelbd TPCarney it'd be great if more people weren't half pregnant with the invasion so inquiries could center on things like that.
brianbeutler	707767493696163841	2016-03-10T03:18:14	TPCarney there's no burning controversy surrounding Benghazi rooted in larger questions about the invasion, as the question demonstrated.

brianbeutler	707705470765502464	2016-03-09T23:11:47	The rise of Trump/Cruz suggests there were more powerful forces preventing the GOP from working w/ Obama than a shortage of cocktail parties

brianbeutler	707693157044113408	2016-03-09T22:22:51	So many identical, “organic” takes about how Cruz and Rubio should team up, it’s like they were concocted on some kind of Journolist.

brianbeutler	707315404662841345	2016-03-08T21:21:48	jeffspross michaelbd yes.
brianbeutler	707314650124316672	2016-03-08T21:18:48	chuckdupree michaelbd jestlawrence jeffspross I think an ethnically tolerant party pushing somewhat lower taxes/regs would be popular.
brianbeutler	707312580986060800	2016-03-08T21:10:35	Let's dispel with this fiction that Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing. 
brianbeutler	707310349062676480	2016-03-08T21:01:43	michaelbd jestlawrence jeffspross you should know: I would find much of the Dougherty reform party platform very appealing.

brianbeutler	707308592198721536	2016-03-08T20:54:44	michaelbd jestlawrence jeffspross nor do I. I’m saying don’t appeal to the WWC lizard brain…
brianbeutler	707307894165864449	2016-03-08T20:51:57	michaelbd jestlawrence jeffspross yeah, my view too. Don’t shun WWC, but appeal in ways that can split anxious wheat from racist chaff.
brianbeutler	707307455542398976	2016-03-08T20:50:13	jeffspross michaelbd Can’t say it’d work, but would be a good start.
brianbeutler	707307389528248325	2016-03-08T20:49:57	jeffspross michaelbd then hope is racism becomes fringier and/or racists find better outlets for grievances.
brianbeutler	707306837381652480	2016-03-08T20:47:45	jeffspross michaelbd could still be fiscally/socially conservative without giving quarter to Trumpism/Palinism/Limbaugism.

brianbeutler	707305711341080576	2016-03-08T20:43:17	jeffspross michaelbd doesn’t solve everything, but denying a political home/outlet to people motivated by racism would be a big step.
brianbeutler	707305329697144833	2016-03-08T20:41:46	jeffspross michaelbd it’s hard. My unpopularopinion is that drastically reforming Republican politics is a key predicate.
brianbeutler	707304824786788352	2016-03-08T20:39:45	kausmickey eliasisquith jeffspross sure. Point is agreeing on said appeal is hard if we're confused about who’s being appealed to.
brianbeutler	707302902507905024	2016-03-08T20:32:07	michaelbd jeffspross I think they leave it out because it’s embarrassing/raises uncomfortable questions.
brianbeutler	707302049784922115	2016-03-08T20:28:44	jeffspross in the end, neoliberal sellouts do a better job accounting for both intertwined Trump causes than those to our left or right.
brianbeutler	707301485898567681	2016-03-08T20:26:29	jeffspross the anxiety joke is a way of ferreting out that omission. Not to give short shrift to the economic side of the analysis.
brianbeutler	707301031860936705	2016-03-08T20:24:41	jeffspross To the contrary, it’s conservatives, centrists, and (a very few) on the left who sanitize racism out of their Trump analyses.

brianbeutler	707286556579635201	2016-03-08T19:27:10	eliasisquith jeffspross think it’s even easier to see than that. Economic anxiety is *by no means* a white only phenomenon.
brianbeutler	707285772752330758	2016-03-08T19:24:03	No, not even a little. Maybe you think all white political writers grew up in suburban Westchester, but I didn’t.  
brianbeutler	707284607163637762	2016-03-08T19:19:25	Both factors—dislocation, racism—contribute, and are intertwined in key ways. But one strain of Trump analysis omits the latter altogether.
brianbeutler	707284148331913217	2016-03-08T19:17:36	Purpose of “economic anxiety” joke is to highlight vast center/right aversion to acknowledging widespread racism contributes to Trumpism.

brianbeutler	707214679639072768	2016-03-08T14:41:33	In that light, Brooks' column looks less high minded, more like standard Trump/Cruz panic that stems from fear of losing in November.
brianbeutler	707214257016807424	2016-03-08T14:39:52	Only reason to pull for Rubio or Kasich is to delay reckoning, and salvage fading hope that GOP can beat Clinton without changing anything.
brianbeutler	707213532220116992	2016-03-08T14:37:00	If you think the GOP needs to begin the reform process, and urgently so, Trump's the guy, Cruz an acceptable alternative.

brianbeutler	704757959390265346	2016-03-01T19:59:25	They’re misrepresenting his mandate position because his view that people shouldn’t die due to lack of insurance is popular and moral.
brianbeutler	704757295511633920	2016-03-01T19:56:47	But one of the things that horrifies Trump's conservative critics most is that his [mumble mumble] includes providing for the indigent.

brianbeutler	704756601476030464	2016-03-01T19:54:02	He’s tried to clear it up since then, awkwardly, because, again, sub-fluent in policy jargon.
brianbeutler	704756423008382977	2016-03-01T19:53:19	Everyone assumes he meant the coverage mandate, when he was pretty clearly referring to prohibiting preexisting conditions discrimination.
brianbeutler	704755634017853444	2016-03-01T19:50:11	Trump replies, "Well, I like the mandate. Okay, so here's where I'm a little bit different. I don't want people dying on the streets."
brianbeutler	704755446993788928	2016-03-01T19:49:26	So Anderson Cooper asks 'if…there’s no [individual mandate], why would an insurance company insure somebody with a preexisting condition?'
brianbeutler	704755058630664192	2016-03-01T19:47:54	Fact that Trump is sub-fluent in policy jargon makes him hard to pin down, but also easy for critics to pin views on him that aren’t his.
brianbeutler	704754277198274561	2016-03-01T19:44:48	I actually think Rubio (and his supporters and many reporters) are wrong about Trump’s position. Hear me out.

brianbeutler	704002152860094464	2016-02-28T17:56:07	Truth is, many people grasped Trump and his durability from the start, but underrepresented on TV, major media, etc. 
brianbeutler	704000118857588738	2016-02-28T17:48:02	Seems like a bad idea for a party to subordinate moral precepts beneath the principle that it’s one Benghazi email away from total power.
brianbeutler	703984458307862528	2016-02-28T16:45:48	IanCeraolo I think it’s fair to call Trump a kind of reactionary centrist, but a kind of centrism that only plays popularly on the right.

brianbeutler	703684180899729410	2016-02-27T20:52:37	Trump's attacks puerile/stupid but almost always cut to real/deep weakness in victim. No one cares what Trump looks like.

brianbeutler	703622844064858112	2016-02-27T16:48:53	The most ironic part of this story is Alex Castellanos, creator of the White Hands ad, fretting over Trump's appeal:

brianbeutler	703616186559422465	2016-02-27T16:22:26	Yes. Which is part of the reason Republicans all attack Trump as a liberal. Better to pass the buck than reckon.

brianbeutler	703605615625547776	2016-02-27T15:40:25	Some thoughts on why the GOP is so wedded to this particular, failed line of attack.  
brianbeutler	703456455698079744	2016-02-27T05:47:43	That quote, from your book, implicated the administration.

brianbeutler	703424975865323520	2016-02-27T03:42:37	kept_simple given that, there's clarifying value in letting parties pick candidates based on what's important to their voters.
brianbeutler	703424312963899392	2016-02-27T03:39:59	kept_simple to some extent, but a lot of that is because those issues are just partisan at this point. Like climate change.
brianbeutler	703412661107757056	2016-02-27T02:53:41	DouthatNYT if they fell into line (and maybe even if not) a lot of conservative movement infrastructure would crumble.
brianbeutler	703412365711294464	2016-02-27T02:52:31	DouthatNYT leadership abandonment of Trump would turn millions against the party enduringly, but movement would live to fight another day.
brianbeutler	703411818895691776	2016-02-27T02:50:21	DouthatNYT not sure/haven't considered what'll happen, but seems it'll pit their commitments to movement and party against one another.
brianbeutler	703408508125904896	2016-02-27T02:37:11	Trump's GOP orbit, once small, is rapidly expanding: he's now on phone daily with friendly party and policy figures, per person familiar
brianbeutler	703408537700061185	2016-02-27T02:37:18	kept_simple a rare take I disagree with.
brianbeutler	703397425126514688	2016-02-27T01:53:09	Would be final nail in old-GOP's coffin if losing candidates refused to support the winner after promising to do so.

brianbeutler	703373455681589248	2016-02-27T00:17:54	willbunnett maybe unfair, but different standard may apply if wild unpredictability is your whole game.
brianbeutler	703373002822516737	2016-02-27T00:16:06	Related: Cruz's decision to lay fairly low today, (i.e. to let Rubio undertake the risk of being Trump's chief antagonist) was very shrewd.
brianbeutler	703371311209451520	2016-02-27T00:09:23	ArkDavey well, Trump was pretty Trump today too.
brianbeutler	703370950738321409	2016-02-27T00:07:57	Kinda remarkable how readily (if briefly) folks set aside that heuristic to interpret Rubio's new stand-up routine as a sign of strength.
brianbeutler	703370483614486528	2016-02-27T00:06:05	The flailing candidate is usually losing, the steady-handed person is usually winning. Pretty standard rule.
brianbeutler	703370203644698624	2016-02-27T00:04:59	But in my experience, when a candidate abruptly adopts his opponent's tactics, politicos usually recognize it as a sign of desperation.
brianbeutler	703369747258331137	2016-02-27T00:03:10	Before the Christie endorsement, conservatives were exulting in Rubio stealing Trump's tactics. And to be fair, he was pretty good at it.
brianbeutler	703233907806904320	2016-02-26T15:03:23	Maybe one reason Rubio took so long to attack Trump is that his entire adult life has been devoted to sucking up to people like him.

brianbeutler	703328311599112192	2016-02-26T21:18:31	jbview But to the extent that they have attacked him, “Trump is liberal” has probably been the attack they've resorted to most.
brianbeutler	703327984187531265	2016-02-26T21:17:13	jbview I mean, I agree insofar as the GOP has undertaken NO sustained effort to attack Trump.
brianbeutler	703326937863884800	2016-02-26T21:13:03	jbview oh but they have! it’s been the most popular line against him in anti-Trump ads, in conservative media, and on debate stages.
brianbeutler	703324703574904832	2016-02-26T21:04:11	The "Trump is actually liberal!” line serves the same revisionist purposes as the right’s alt civil rights history.

brianbeutler	703320943372976130	2016-02-26T20:49:14	That’s why conservatives cottoned to it, and why I don’t think it’s going anywhere.
brianbeutler	703320762980175872	2016-02-26T20:48:31	Attacking Trump for being liberal serves the special-pleading purpose of exonerating conservatives for creating him. 
brianbeutler	703319711526854656	2016-02-26T20:44:20	Problem is, attacking Trump as risible and corrupt raises question of how a risible, corrupt demagogue took over GOP 
brianbeutler	703316291516559360	2016-02-26T20:30:45	Late observations: Last night exposed just how impotent months of “actually, Trump is a liberal” attacks have been.

brianbeutler	703295399927353345	2016-02-26T19:07:44	The glimmer of good news for conservatives here is that Christie’s kinda sui generis and might not open floodgates for other endorsers.

brianbeutler	703276704303742976	2016-02-26T17:53:27	Huge. Trump's biggest endorsement. Maybe the biggest endorsement of the campaign so far - Chris Christie 
brianbeutler	703281136542289920	2016-02-26T18:11:03	Easy to forget but Rubio is abdicating his Senate seat. If he loses the nom, he’ll have a hard time clawing his way back into the arena.
brianbeutler	703280542553350144	2016-02-26T18:08:42	The effect of Christie’s actions today and on the debate stage won’t just be to deny Rubio the nomination, but to end his political career.
brianbeutler	703280130081345536	2016-02-26T18:07:03	DouthatNYT And that in turn raised concerns that underneath the facade, Rubio might actually be a...chocker.
brianbeutler	703279912405303296	2016-02-26T18:06:12	DouthatNYT I don't think that why the Rubiobot critique stuck. It stuck because it demonstrated that Rubio's competence may be a facade.
brianbeutler	703278828840468480	2016-02-26T18:01:53	DouthatNYT jbarro still is, by and large.
brianbeutler	703249782958133248	2016-02-26T16:06:28	jbarro The sad irony is that Trump's "lines around states" bluster really WAS the GOP alternative to Obamacare.
brianbeutler	703278100776353792	2016-02-26T17:59:00	The party decides. 
brianbeutler	703277511002759169	2016-02-26T17:56:39	Quick edit: Let’s dispell with this fiction that Marco Rubio knows how to spel.

brianbeutler	703274206935523328	2016-02-26T17:43:31	“Haha, Trump spells as bad as immigrants!” is a grotesque joke.
brianbeutler	703272550428753920	2016-02-26T17:36:56	The reason this matters at all is that Rubio’s “joking" that maybe an immigrant is responsible for Trump’s tweets. 
brianbeutler	703271200877838336	2016-02-26T17:31:35	In short: “Chocker” was a typo. But Rubio seems to think that’s the correct way to spell “choker” and that C-H-O-K-E-R is a spelling error.
brianbeutler	703270214952206336	2016-02-26T17:27:40	PatrickRuffini brianbeutler no Brian is right. Go back and listen to the tape. He says "chocker" on the chokers and "choker" on chocker.
brianbeutler	703269581503270912	2016-02-26T17:25:09	jbarro Nope. He was reading this now deleted tweet:  and pronounced the correct spellings wrong and vice versa.
brianbeutler	703267805387431937	2016-02-26T17:18:05	Trump spelled choker C-H-O-K-E-R and C-H-O-C-K-E-R. Rubio thought the first one was pronounced "chalker" and the second one was correct.
brianbeutler	703259422093647876	2016-02-26T16:44:46	It’s actually a pretty good riff, but if you’re gonna rip on someone for spelling errors...

brianbeutler	700114938996486144	2016-02-18T00:29:43	jadler1969 yes, I intentionally left out every piece of history that has no bearing on today's conundrum.
brianbeutler	700110453230284800	2016-02-18T00:11:54	jadler1969 As I say in the piece, we can't know because GOP got here first. But these norms deteriorated tremendously in the last 7 years.

brianbeutler	700088607495704576	2016-02-17T22:45:05	SCOTUS fights generate tons of partisan false piety, but there's room for agreement on how the politics shake out. 
brianbeutler	700035412618661888	2016-02-17T19:13:43	The "should" in McConnell's initial statement is very interesting... 
brianbeutler	700037367160299520	2016-02-17T19:21:29	Here’s how to make sense of Mitch McConnell’s quick-draw, partisan reaction to Scalia’s death. 
brianbeutler	700021728584531969	2016-02-17T18:19:20	kenhoagland EdMorrissey I agree, and I wrote this intentionally as a very narrowly-drawn political analysis.
brianbeutler	700016679271710720	2016-02-17T17:59:16	.elspethreeve is journalism’s foremost Internetographist. Read her two latest.    
brianbeutler	700015557806960640	2016-02-17T17:54:49	This is an excellent analysis of why I was wrong to think McConnell panicked. 
brianbeutler	700011178513203200	2016-02-17T17:37:25	IvanTheK JebBush brianbeutler So are Toyotas, but you wouldn't tweet a photo of a Camry and caption it 'America.'
brianbeutler	700011238093406208	2016-02-17T17:37:39	Did Mitch McConnell blow it on SCOTUS? (Partial spoiler: no, I don't really think he did.) 
brianbeutler	700009114496184320	2016-02-17T17:29:13	I just noticed that the "America" gun tweeted by JebBush was made by FN Herstal; Belgian-owned gun manufacturer. 
brianbeutler	700009383107948544	2016-02-17T17:30:17	wrdcsc on lunch and on the shifting politics of the court, we agree.
brianbeutler	700009090014191616	2016-02-17T17:29:07	wrdcsc never contested this! Just wish one conservative would cop to the obvious, stop pretending this is the other edge of the Bork sword.
brianbeutler	700007489237086208	2016-02-17T17:22:45	wrdcsc this is precisely what makes it a power grab. You say raw politics. But in your version the court was politically null 3 years ago.
brianbeutler	700006675638587394	2016-02-17T17:19:31	wrdcsc you also admit that the electorate was highly attuned to the power of the Court in 2012 (think NFIB) and it returned Obama to office
brianbeutler	700005991325290498	2016-02-17T17:16:48	wrdcsc right, but for the fact that this is unprecedented, it would be totally precedented.
brianbeutler	700005397994856448	2016-02-17T17:14:27	wrdcsc Not denying Bork was a provocation, but a provocation to nix a left nominee, not to moot the appointment power.
brianbeutler	700004557074599936	2016-02-17T17:11:06	wrdcsc the nuclear option follows naturally from McConnell's tactics. McConnell's tactics have no predicate.
brianbeutler	700004332717150208	2016-02-17T17:10:13	wrdcsc much like now a power grab to preserve the ideological balance of a court. Sorry, but there is no precedent for that.
brianbeutler	700004031729688578	2016-02-17T17:09:01	wrdcsc but in context it was a remedy to McConnell's indiscriminate filibuster of three circuit court moms.
brianbeutler	700003640157798400	2016-02-17T17:07:27	wrdcsc I personally think the nuclear option is great, and that Republicans should've done it 12 years ago...
brianbeutler	700003376277413889	2016-02-17T17:06:24	wrdcsc I'm not upset at all, just think comparing Obama's (bad but harmless) debt limit vote to the Boehner rule is replacement level spin.
brianbeutler	699996547505876993	2016-02-17T16:39:16	wrdcsc to suggest it was all part of a smooth continuum is just grossly misleading.
brianbeutler	699996418057043968	2016-02-17T16:38:46	wrdcsc that bears no resemblance to refusing to end a filibuster until ransom has been paid. Obama never attempted this, nor did Reid.
brianbeutler	699996190495150080	2016-02-17T16:37:51	wrdcsc was standard for the minority to posture about the debt limit and then allow it to be raised mostly with votes from the majority.
brianbeutler	699995892070240256	2016-02-17T16:36:40	wrdcsc moreover, Obama’s admitted that his cloture vote was political and irresponsible. But it was part of a rich, childish tradition.
brianbeutler	699995387583660033	2016-02-17T16:34:40	wrdcsc that’s crap. Obama should’ve voted for cloture on raising the debt limit and also the GOP did something much different and worse.
brianbeutler	699995074462162944	2016-02-17T16:33:25	…or anything other than a naked power grab.
brianbeutler	699994944925253632	2016-02-17T16:32:54	But it's remarkable how successfully they’ve pushed the line that this is business as usual or uncharted territory...
brianbeutler	699994317243420672	2016-02-17T16:30:25	Anyhow, there’s no constitutional remedy to force Republicans to confirm a justice, and as I've said, I totally understand their reluctance.
brianbeutler	699993983871795200	2016-02-17T16:29:05	“Hostage taking...has long been a standard way of doing business in Washington."  etc etc
brianbeutler	699993783371505664	2016-02-17T16:28:17	wrdcsc you’re better than this kind of whataboutism, especially since Obama’s vote bears no resemblance to the Boehner rule.
brianbeutler	699993131211747328	2016-02-17T16:25:42	But it wasn’t uncommon at all to see reporters treat it as a familiar part of the rich pageant of legislative negotiation.
brianbeutler	699992779485769728	2016-02-17T16:24:18	One party had genuinely never weaponized the debt limit to mug the president of another party before.
brianbeutler	699992405160943618	2016-02-17T16:22:49	Republicans were quite literally threatening to destroy the economy unless President Obama signed the GOP agenda into law.
brianbeutler	699992213250555904	2016-02-17T16:22:03	Saw this same thing happen all the time during the 2011 and 2013 debt-limit fights.

brianbeutler	699608738936664064	2016-02-16T14:58:16	HeerJeet you're stepping on brianbeutler's toes here
brianbeutler	699777925931925504	2016-02-17T02:10:33	brianbeutler Same old Obama is both a Machiavellian schemer bent on destroying the Republic AND an incompetent empty suit deal, probly.
brianbeutler	699777713792380930	2016-02-17T02:09:42	Do conspiracy theorists explain why Obama murdered the 79 year old justice rather than the 61 year old justice?
brianbeutler	699692755195400192	2016-02-16T20:32:07	Remember before trump despoiled the conservative movement and republicans could focus on serious stuff like renaming french fries?
brianbeutler	699703375290507264	2016-02-16T21:14:19	If you had “intersectional” on your campaign 2016 bingo card, you are in luck. 
brianbeutler	699773597129158657	2016-02-17T01:53:21	I like how this conspiracy theory meme implicitly celebrates the notion that Scalia was plotting a military coup. 
brianbeutler	699766676724776961	2016-02-17T01:25:51	wrdcsc chrislhayes I'd add that resorting to a hypothetical involving a president on the verge of impeachment proves too much.
brianbeutler	699765976062103552	2016-02-17T01:23:04	wrdcsc chrislhayes she features in my story on this!
brianbeutler	699763918735015938	2016-02-17T01:14:53	wrdcsc chrislhayes I've never said what McConnell et al are doing is impermissible. Quite the contrary.
brianbeutler	699743116824342528	2016-02-16T23:52:14	brianbeutler And then Ginsberg retires on like day two of Hillary’s presidency...
brianbeutler	699742844664352768	2016-02-16T23:51:09	Alternatively: Clinton’s leading in polls this fall, Obama’s nominee languishes, she says her first act as POTUS will be to nominate Obama.
brianbeutler	699737247155937280	2016-02-16T23:28:54	I don't get logic Trump has ceiling. Candidate definition isn't static. Winning/losing alters voter perceptions. 
brianbeutler	699740064046321666	2016-02-16T23:40:06	You’ll marvel at this time stamp when Hillary is on SCOTUS, Elizabeth Warren is POTUS, and Scott Brown is Senator from Massachusetts again.

brianbeutler	699715904351895552	2016-02-16T22:04:06	Weird that Obama is giving a press conference with just 11 months left in his presidency
brianbeutler	699735334175768577	2016-02-16T23:21:18	wrdcsc chrislhayes there’s a huge difference between Dems nixing Bork then confirming Kennedy and McConnell nixing everyone sight unseen.
brianbeutler	699734397256339456	2016-02-16T23:17:35	wrdcsc chrislhayes I also find it hard to believe you summarily reject the distinction Chris is drawing here.
brianbeutler	699734214560849921	2016-02-16T23:16:51	wrdcsc chrislhayes I tend to agree that principles aren’t a major motivating factor here either way.     BUT!
brianbeutler	699733683700396036	2016-02-16T23:14:45	chrislhayes wrdcsc Bork also got voted down without a filibuster, and by a wide margin that included six Republicans, fwiw.
brianbeutler	699732812967120896	2016-02-16T23:11:17	@JimbauxsJournal “fair hearing” is a direct quote from the story.
brianbeutler	699732632918212608	2016-02-16T23:10:34	@JimbauxsJournal no, I’m not. It is a lie to say you will give someone a “fair hearing” when you know you’re going to do no such thing.

brianbeutler	699704472512106497	2016-02-16T21:18:40	.jonathanchait also highlighted contrasting GOP reactions to Trump’s 9/11 memories, but at excruciating length. 
brianbeutler	699702135559163904	2016-02-16T21:09:23	jonathanchait I see. The thought came to me (with typical pith) in response to this tweet  before I read your latest

brianbeutler	699699681073434624	2016-02-16T20:59:38	Republicans are way more comfortable with Trump saying Muslims cheered 9/11 in Jersey than with Trump saying Bush was president on 9/11.
brianbeutler	699699195012345857	2016-02-16T20:57:42	Good point. Trump promotes the conspiracy theory that 1000s of Muslims were cheering from Jersey rooftops on 9/11.
