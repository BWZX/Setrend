ptcherneva	686240148862963712	2016-01-10T17:36:15	SerbanVCEnache elliswinningham 2Noam those prblms r many no doubt. Check in the mail doesn't solve them. Must take on dfclt policy chlngs
ptcherneva	686239007617974272	2016-01-10T17:31:43	SerbanVCEnache elliswinningham 2Noam see my "completing the Roosevelt Revolution" piece. Long run JG will be relatively small.
ptcherneva	686238760758022144	2016-01-10T17:30:44	SerbanVCEnache elliswinningham 2Noam JG does that. The needed empl stabilizer that enhances priv sector empl.
ptcherneva	686238460848517121	2016-01-10T17:29:33	SerbanVCEnache elliswinningham 2Noam UBI raises consumption on the bottom and only if it's not inflated away, which I think is v likely
ptcherneva	686238190299144192	2016-01-10T17:28:28	SerbanVCEnache elliswinningham 2Noam I dont. It's UBI advocates claim that many social problems will b solved with UBI. I disagree
ptcherneva	686233872879718401	2016-01-10T17:11:19	SerbanVCEnache elliswinningham 2Noam you can't fine-tune your way out of econ problems. Direct action/policy design needed. UBI ain't it.
ptcherneva	686233172187676673	2016-01-10T17:08:32	SerbanVCEnache SubBeck elliswinningham 2Noam this whole argmnt is abt the wealthy getting UBI. Why haven't they solved key prblms alrdy?
ptcherneva	686232480979021824	2016-01-10T17:05:47	SerbanVCEnache elliswinningham 2Noam there's no such thing as value free/neutral method/policy.

ptcherneva	686231598971355136	2016-01-10T17:02:17	SerbanVCEnache elliswinningham 2Noam precisely y it's important which paradigm JG is born out of. It's a real alternatv to forced emplymt
ptcherneva	686231039744851969	2016-01-10T17:00:04	SerbanVCEnache SubBeck elliswinningham 2Noam what makes you think that if we suddenly gave UBI to all, these problems will be solved.
ptcherneva	686230603377803264	2016-01-10T16:58:20	SerbanVCEnache SubBeck elliswinningham 2Noam why haven't current recipients of UBI already solved the pressing problems of our time?
ptcherneva	686230091521720320	2016-01-10T16:56:18	SerbanVCEnache elliswinningham 2Noam at least the case advocated by progresive advocates of UBI.
ptcherneva	686229694753144835	2016-01-10T16:54:43	SerbanVCEnache elliswinningham 2Noam both Left and Right made a case 4 UBI. Pt is using Hayek to further goals of UBI is unholy alliance

ptcherneva	685507201469968384	2016-01-08T17:03:47	2noame neilwilson equalitus you know that all JG supporters advocate some JG&amp;UBI combo. But UBI alone doesn't do what its advocates claim
ptcherneva	685272092552605696	2016-01-08T01:29:33	2noame but how? invisible hand? JG provides the organization, the institution, the support
ptcherneva	685266372633452545	2016-01-08T01:06:49	2noame JG advocates see gazillion important things that need doing &amp; many people who want to work. They r solving problems not 'inventing'.
ptcherneva	685265770096529408	2016-01-08T01:04:25	2noam don't think so. e.g., the fact that Hayek &amp; Friedman supported UBI is a key problem, exactly because it's born out of their paradigm.
ptcherneva	685264415491518468	2016-01-08T00:59:02	2noame The top also enjoys a job guarantee,  but I don't consider, say, Jamie Diamond a compelling example.  But that just me.
ptcherneva	685263537065738240	2016-01-08T00:55:33	2noame oh, get it. Just never understood why UBI would make its case even if it has to use objectionable role models or the wrong paradigm.
