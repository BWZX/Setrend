alexwagner	725151235997839361	2016-04-27T02:35:01	Trump is absolutely right about the impossibility of his party giving the nomination to anyone else if he gets close enough to 1,237.
alexwagner	725147663910506497	2016-04-27T02:20:50	Mary Pat Christie looking on at all of this with barely disguised amusement.
alexwagner	725146932147019776	2016-04-27T02:17:55	It's official. There is no Republican Party. Trump beat Kasich in Greenwich. The home of Prescott Bush.  
alexwagner	725144577397641216	2016-04-27T02:08:34	Either Paul Manafort is a big fan of stream of consciousness rambling, or he had absolutely nothing to do with Trump's victory speech.
alexwagner	725143515269877761	2016-04-27T02:04:21	Would be particularly triumphant if Christie would just pour a bag of M&amp;Ms into a box of M&amp;Ms right now.

alexwagner	715946318938710016	2016-04-01T16:57:58	Bill Clinton also talks about the "hysterical feelings" out there. (Which could incidentally double as an excellent name for a psych band).
alexwagner	715944780560277504	2016-04-01T16:51:51	MarkHalperin does that make him "Rip Torn"?
alexwagner	715943897340502017	2016-04-01T16:48:21	Bill Clinton on the stump for Hillary in WI manages to cover the Easter uprising, windmills, activist shareholders and the poetry of Yeats.
