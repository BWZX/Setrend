AlyssaRosenberg	726138168421060608	2016-04-29T19:56:45	One of my 2016 resolutions was to tell you more about my critical preferences, so have this essay: 
AlyssaRosenberg	726121098333540352	2016-04-29T18:48:55	One of the great pleasures of diving into old TV shows is just how *surprising* something like TheNakedCity can be.

AlyssaRosenberg	725779659816837120	2016-04-28T20:12:09	jbouie Thank you! I owe you some film or something for all the help.
AlyssaRosenberg	725779047247130624	2016-04-28T20:09:43	I'm especially interested in stuff that looks at the first half of the twentieth century.

AlyssaRosenberg	725777515604750337	2016-04-28T20:03:38	CPThrio TheNerdsofColor Of course!
AlyssaRosenberg	725777474769006592	2016-04-28T20:03:28	CPThrio TheNerdsofColor Basically, I think the anxiety was real, and that the solution was not great. Both things can be true!
AlyssaRosenberg	725777238801715200	2016-04-28T20:02:32	CPThrio TheNerdsofColor Sure; I mean, if nothing else, maybe make the Ancient One African! Pick another continent if that's what it takes!
AlyssaRosenberg	725776890435395585	2016-04-28T20:01:09	CPThrio TheNerdsofColor I just don't know how much leeway they'd have to do consumer research in China. It's a worthwhile question.
AlyssaRosenberg	725774807745323008	2016-04-28T19:52:53	CPThrio TheNerdsofColor Er, IN China. See what happens when I try to save characters?
AlyssaRosenberg	725774733309005824	2016-04-28T19:52:35	CPThrio TheNerdsofColor Agree on scrutinizing the black leads canard. Be curious about how Western companies do consumer polling China.
AlyssaRosenberg	725773834071228417	2016-04-28T19:49:00	CPThrio TheNerdsofColor (I should note I'm talking about something distinct in this piece: getting through foreign censor boards.)
AlyssaRosenberg	725773710691553280	2016-04-28T19:48:31	CPThrio TheNerdsofColor Worth reading stuff for what it's like to go through the Chinese censors: 
AlyssaRosenberg	725772585674354688	2016-04-28T19:44:03	KrisPigna Yes. Also, more people should talk about the Fury Road-The General parallels.
AlyssaRosenberg	725771686927294464	2016-04-28T19:40:29	Seriously, I'm watching Buster Keaton's Convict13 short, and it's sharper and more pleasurable than any feature I've seen this year.
AlyssaRosenberg	725771469444276224	2016-04-28T19:39:37	RobBricken I'm watching Convict 13 now, which is just darkly perfect.
AlyssaRosenberg	725770746270781441	2016-04-28T19:36:44	No one choreographs a chase sequence like Buster Keaton. No one.
AlyssaRosenberg	725766379547295744	2016-04-28T19:19:23	Going to spend the rest of my day watching silent short films, so be excellent to each other.
AlyssaRosenberg	725764965378985985	2016-04-28T19:13:46	Wanting a campaign to change something to be effective is not the same thing as thinking that an existing problem is acceptable.
AlyssaRosenberg	725764657454170113	2016-04-28T19:12:33	TheNerdsofColor (Also, frankly, if you can make a Doctor Strange movie, a bunch of other characters ought to be on the table)
AlyssaRosenberg	725764573471584257	2016-04-28T19:12:13	TheNerdsofColor For sure.
AlyssaRosenberg	725762438025633800	2016-04-28T19:03:43	TheNerdsofColor Indeed! It's a weird and complicated time. Which is understating things.
AlyssaRosenberg	725761995283259392	2016-04-28T19:01:58	TheNerdsofColor Of course! I just think we need to grapple seriously with the power of China's market, and international markets generally.
AlyssaRosenberg	725761358189498368	2016-04-28T18:59:26	TheNerdsofColor I think we're on the same, or adjacent, pages here. The problem can be real, and the solution on offer can fall short.
AlyssaRosenberg	725761166522372097	2016-04-28T18:58:40	TheNerdsofColor Absolutely.

AlyssaRosenberg	725760426672283649	2016-04-28T18:55:44	TheNerdsofColor + figure out ways to guide studios and individual directors through those thickets.
AlyssaRosenberg	725760360502988800	2016-04-28T18:55:28	TheNerdsofColor That said, if perceptions about market preferences and government censorship are leading to bad decisions, we need to +
AlyssaRosenberg	725760188616200192	2016-04-28T18:54:47	TheNerdsofColor Again, I agree!
AlyssaRosenberg	725759957279322112	2016-04-28T18:53:52	TheNerdsofColor I mean, Chinese government censorship is a real, tangible thing.
AlyssaRosenberg	725758613042634754	2016-04-28T18:48:31	TheNerdsofColor Don't think it excuses it. But it's a good illustration of a market force I think our discussions have tended to underplay.

AlyssaRosenberg	725486222097928192	2016-04-28T00:46:08	slb79 But it could go either way. That's what's risky and interesting about it, the interpretive space that's left behind.
AlyssaRosenberg	725485810573840387	2016-04-28T00:44:30	slb79 Agreed. Part of the play could be that she refuses and restores her upper hand.
AlyssaRosenberg	725485595947065344	2016-04-28T00:43:39	slb79 I am fascinated by the choice to present his redemption largely through video of him being a good father.
AlyssaRosenberg	725484742775296000	2016-04-28T00:40:16	slb79 So there's something fascinating about that line: she's so realized she can play at being abused.
AlyssaRosenberg	725483543044956160	2016-04-28T00:35:30	slb79 It honestly feels like one of the most intimate moments on either album to me, acknowledging a sort of raw power play.

AlyssaRosenberg	714464123577364480	2016-03-28T14:48:15	bonomoam Yeah, there are house styles that writers at big publications have to follow.
AlyssaRosenberg	714462334807379968	2016-03-28T14:41:09	bonomoam This is not the sort of thing I get to decide on my own; newsrooms have rules.
AlyssaRosenberg	714459522606215169	2016-03-28T14:29:58	bonomoam I'd have to check with the copy desk on whether our style allows that for movie adaptations.
AlyssaRosenberg	714453526823452672	2016-03-28T14:06:09	My notes from BatmanvSuperman, transcribed:

AlyssaRosenberg	714244233872478208	2016-03-28T00:14:30	jodyleetweet Yes, it is delightful.
AlyssaRosenberg	714229245724205056	2016-03-27T23:14:56	This time next week, I'll be on vacation. What should I read?
AlyssaRosenberg	714212120859123714	2016-03-27T22:06:53	jsende Hey, we are apartment dwellers. We each have a couple hundred volumes at our parents' houses.
AlyssaRosenberg	714156027999076352	2016-03-27T18:24:00	Books, pre-sorting. 
AlyssaRosenberg	713534382204657665	2016-03-26T01:13:48	Moved successfully. Never, ever moving to a new apartment, under any circumstances.
AlyssaRosenberg	713485638025220096	2016-03-25T22:00:06	MarkHarrisNYC Awful headline ideas. Dreadful misuse of resources. Total lack of news sense.

AlyssaRosenberg	713089822433394688	2016-03-24T19:47:16	FWIW, I just figured out how to fix the DC Cinematic Universe. Now all I need is a cosmic cube to go back in time and convince WB.
AlyssaRosenberg	713086138450313217	2016-03-24T19:32:38	scottmeslow SonnyBunch Also seems like a problem that Superman is the least popular of the trio on social.

AlyssaRosenberg	712698832119840768	2016-03-23T17:53:37	Well, BatmanvSuperman earns the distinction of being the first piece of art to drive me to use ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ in a review. criticproblems
AlyssaRosenberg	712696118333849600	2016-03-23T17:42:50	KSofen Nope, but thanks for the recommendation.
AlyssaRosenberg	712695983151452161	2016-03-23T17:42:18	gilbertcruz Really disappointed in io9 for this.
AlyssaRosenberg	712694514264223745	2016-03-23T17:36:28	KSofen Oh, for sure. Not suggesting anything else.
AlyssaRosenberg	712692729201954817	2016-03-23T17:29:22	theseantcollins All their key art is so ridiculously good.
AlyssaRosenberg	712692207296364546	2016-03-23T17:27:18	Who wore it better 
AlyssaRosenberg	712685994391314432	2016-03-23T17:02:36	"The world has no right to my heart" is basically the reason I don't write personal essays. Hamilton
AlyssaRosenberg	712683796710219777	2016-03-23T16:53:52	_Charette_ SonnyBunch Agreed. Trying to dig myself out of this BatmanvSuperman-shaped hole to put down more coherent thoughts.
AlyssaRosenberg	712670509360619520	2016-03-23T16:01:04	didic Just gorgeous.
AlyssaRosenberg	712670313113321472	2016-03-23T16:00:18	The opening of Watchmen is still one of the best movie depictions of how society might handle superheroes in its midst.
AlyssaRosenberg	712666163524853760	2016-03-23T15:43:48	BreakingRad I mean, I think it's a combination of factors.
AlyssaRosenberg	712663353550880768	2016-03-23T15:32:38	Poormojo No, but it's a lot of stuff like: "That was a very careful shot to avoid showing us Zod's junk."
AlyssaRosenberg	712661703943659520	2016-03-23T15:26:05	Includes reference to one of the Buffy moments that STILL chokes me up, even after all these years. 
AlyssaRosenberg	712656963197353985	2016-03-23T15:07:15	In advance of BatmanvSuperman , some thoughts on when superheroes turn executioner: 
AlyssaRosenberg	712656272802385921	2016-03-23T15:04:30	bettyaberlin That question was for something else.
AlyssaRosenberg	712654456861691905	2016-03-23T14:57:17	Dirk2112 Monday.
AlyssaRosenberg	712654398917361667	2016-03-23T14:57:03	Okay, you will get the full transcription of my BatmanvSuperman notes on Monday, when they will make more sense to all of you.
AlyssaRosenberg	712652696369672195	2016-03-23T14:50:17	Tempted to make my BatmanvSuperman review just a straight transcription of my notes from the screening.
AlyssaRosenberg	712628599266750467	2016-03-23T13:14:32	.MattGertz petersuderman No way, that was obviously the best part of the movie.
AlyssaRosenberg	712621201001152512	2016-03-23T12:45:08	My third favorite part of Batman v Superman was petersuderman's declaration that the film needed more Aquaman.
AlyssaRosenberg	712621072751923200	2016-03-23T12:44:38	My second favorite part of Batman v Superman was how much owillis will hate it.
AlyssaRosenberg	712620757214437377	2016-03-23T12:43:23	My favorite part of Batman v Superman was when the appellate court refused to hear the case en banc following the 2-1 panel decision.
AlyssaRosenberg	712616447864758272	2016-03-23T12:26:15	Inferno313 this is...more so than most.
AlyssaRosenberg	712616228804689921	2016-03-23T12:25:23	bearcat97 There is very little of her, honestly.
AlyssaRosenberg	712615645905485826	2016-03-23T12:23:04	BatmanvSuperman almost makes sense as a movie if you look at it as the chronicle of Bruce Wayne's descent into severe mental illness.
AlyssaRosenberg	712459289869156352	2016-03-23T02:01:46	achter I have not been sleeping well.
AlyssaRosenberg	712399528482238465	2016-03-22T22:04:17	Glenn__Kenny Hmmm, I guess I would be interested in both answers?
AlyssaRosenberg	712396739257442304	2016-03-22T21:53:12	DJAnyReason Of course, not, I"m just curious about the fact that people are citing folks who seem to provide a sense of political clarity.
AlyssaRosenberg	712396460940255232	2016-03-22T21:52:06	That moment when you remember that you can ask alissamarie for advice and a thorny piece of writing suddenly seems less scary.
AlyssaRosenberg	712396218031316993	2016-03-22T21:51:08	michaelbd Yeah, people's answers to this fascinate me because they're almost all naming *political* authorities.
AlyssaRosenberg	712396108455157760	2016-03-22T21:50:42	MattZeitlin To be fair, I have long predicted that the Rock will be the next Reaganesque figure in America.
AlyssaRosenberg	712396028935344129	2016-03-22T21:50:23	Speaking of moral authority, off to see BatmanvSuperman. A nation turns its lonely eyes to you, Zack Snyder.
AlyssaRosenberg	712395740975403008	2016-03-22T21:49:14	Which suggests that political goodness has, on some level, come to substitute for moral goodness. Not sure how I feel about that.
AlyssaRosenberg	712395543809552384	2016-03-22T21:48:27	Part of what fascinates me about your answers to my moral authority question is that almost all of your answers are political.
AlyssaRosenberg	712393784328380417	2016-03-22T21:41:28	For those of you who are citing Lin-Manuel Miranda as a moral authority, I'd be really curious to hear more about your reasoning.
AlyssaRosenberg	712393245662289920	2016-03-22T21:39:20	bogcommenter Yeah, I sort of feel like that's the point.
AlyssaRosenberg	712392900940795904	2016-03-22T21:37:57	So, question for all of you: what figures do you think have the greatest moral authority in America right now.
AlyssaRosenberg	712386152406319104	2016-03-22T21:11:08	janeh227 One way or another, it is my job.
AlyssaRosenberg	712385335133605889	2016-03-22T21:07:54	Desperately trying to stay awake so I can see BatmanvSuperman tonight, but it is proving a challenge.
AlyssaRosenberg	712380380041617408	2016-03-22T20:48:12	notthatswalker That is a great phrase, and perfect for this situation.
AlyssaRosenberg	712366665246314496	2016-03-22T19:53:42	notthatswalker Oh, I like that. They cast Margot Robbie of all people, but Amy Adams would be much better.
AlyssaRosenberg	712358962692235264	2016-03-22T19:23:06	MarkGrinolds That is pretty perfect.
AlyssaRosenberg	712358563470057472	2016-03-22T19:21:31	An ode to PassingStrange, the musical all you folks who love Hamilton should see immediately: 
AlyssaRosenberg	712357380495908865	2016-03-22T19:16:49	eleanorbarkhorn Also good, though with Anne it would be sneaky riff on her own public image, which I would relish.
AlyssaRosenberg	712348287492300800	2016-03-22T18:40:41	OBVIOUSLY Anne Hathaway should play Nancy Kerrigan in this upcoming movie about Tonya Harding.
AlyssaRosenberg	712340446324854784	2016-03-22T18:09:31	TheFienPrint you are not alone.
AlyssaRosenberg	712312822659727360	2016-03-22T16:19:45	Seriously, Sarah McLachlan=pretty much instant weeping. And "Full of Grace" is that effect to the MAX.
AlyssaRosenberg	712312516945321984	2016-03-22T16:18:32	I had forgotten the way Buffy used Sarah McLachlan at the end of "Becoming: Part 2" and now am tearing up at my desk.
AlyssaRosenberg	712295549203046400	2016-03-22T15:11:07	LouisPeitzman I really, really hope they get the class dynamics of this right, too.
AlyssaRosenberg	712295173665980420	2016-03-22T15:09:37	LouisPeitzman I agree. I'm just wondering who would be good for her. Maybe Alison Pill?
AlyssaRosenberg	712294778000564224	2016-03-22T15:08:03	LouisPeitzman Ugh, yes. I have a hard time thinking who would be right for Tonya, honestly.
AlyssaRosenberg	712294526975668224	2016-03-22T15:07:03	LouisPeitzman Oh my Lord. My cousin and I were OBSESSED with her. I am terrified of this.
AlyssaRosenberg	712294119125688320	2016-03-22T15:05:26	LouisPeitzman Wait what is happening.
AlyssaRosenberg	712289861944930304	2016-03-22T14:48:31	realgregneil That's a pretty unfair characterization of their attempts to ask clarifying follow-ups.
AlyssaRosenberg	712287758514065408	2016-03-22T14:40:09	I am just in awe of my PostOpinions colleagues and their work tag-teaming Trump in this interview: 
AlyssaRosenberg	712286600462536704	2016-03-22T14:35:33	danieltwalters It's not about foreign policy, and besides, I leave the puns to petridishes.
AlyssaRosenberg	712286134110449664	2016-03-22T14:33:42	Zootopia's Mayor Lionheart as a stand-in for President Obama:  
AlyssaRosenberg	712281125608009728	2016-03-22T14:13:48	(the inspiration for this came from AlyssaRosenberg as all good things come)  
AlyssaRosenberg	712021638410342400	2016-03-21T21:02:41	katie_barnes3 It might actually be easier if you emailed me: alyssa.rosenberg@washpost.com. This week is crazed, but I will make time.
AlyssaRosenberg	712021290840891392	2016-03-21T21:01:19	katie_barnes3 I don't know if that's helpful or satisfying.
AlyssaRosenberg	712020849893707778	2016-03-21T20:59:33	katie_barnes3 I mean, it's obviously pernicious and the best remedy for it is more happy endings for queer characters.
AlyssaRosenberg	712019634527051776	2016-03-21T20:54:44	katie_barnes3 I have thoughts on the general theme, but not a specific piece to write since I am not caught up on either show.

AlyssaRosenberg	712017368864702470	2016-03-21T20:45:44	Best fantasy crossover episode: the one where Samantha Jones moves to Los Angeles, destroys Ari Gold and becomes Dana Gordon's bestie.
AlyssaRosenberg	712016177632059392	2016-03-21T20:41:00	LBardugo Also, that you were reading my baby blog in 2011 before it was a real thing is just amazing to me.

AlyssaRosenberg	711993536909090816	2016-03-21T19:11:02	On DIVERGENT, ALIENS, and female action heroes: 
AlyssaRosenberg	711993610372313088	2016-03-21T19:11:19	avelino Honestly, despite their shared brutality, I feel like the violence in Deadpool and JessicaJones are very different.
AlyssaRosenberg	711992266819297280	2016-03-21T19:05:59	avelino I want to be able to be honest about that with folks, so i'm glad you appreciated it.
AlyssaRosenberg	711992211332853760	2016-03-21T19:05:46	avelino I loved JessicaJones but have been upset by some of those scenes I mention almost every day since watching it.
AlyssaRosenberg	711991268046458880	2016-03-21T19:02:01	altq42 Thanks, Joshua! I'm really glad to hear people appreciate that.
AlyssaRosenberg	711990883453902848	2016-03-21T19:00:29	squideye Yeah, it's interacting incentives.
AlyssaRosenberg	711990380141682688	2016-03-21T18:58:29	squideye Honestly, I think it's because of the sense that what cable/streaming can do that broadcast can't is sex and violence.
AlyssaRosenberg	711988050591686656	2016-03-21T18:49:14	anthonytaylor_ Hey, it's fine with me if other people don't like it. I love Annaleen's work! We don't have to agree on everything.
AlyssaRosenberg	711987786728022016	2016-03-21T18:48:11	One of the hardest things for me as a critic is dealing with certain kinds of violence:

AlyssaRosenberg	711969645008461824	2016-03-21T17:36:05	CathyReisenwitz Sorry! And yeah, maybe. It makes sense that it would take some time for the movement's influence to filter up to Hollywood!

AlyssaRosenberg	711965511144308736	2016-03-21T17:19:40	A reader in my chat is asking about second-wave feminist movies contemporary to the movement. Any suggestions for them?
AlyssaRosenberg	711964571867680769	2016-03-21T17:15:56	punningpundit I mean, they're separate characters.
AlyssaRosenberg	711964257479475200	2016-03-21T17:14:41	kathryn_kao Going to write on it for tomorrow, I think.
AlyssaRosenberg	711961195524263936	2016-03-21T17:02:31	The chat is live! Come hang out: 
AlyssaRosenberg	711960018220933120	2016-03-21T16:57:50	bonomoam Of course!
AlyssaRosenberg	711959827250028544	2016-03-21T16:57:05	bonomoam If DC is really doing this and shifting back and forth between tones, I'll definitely be into it.
AlyssaRosenberg	711959717220913153	2016-03-21T16:56:38	bonomoam Yeah, I do think it's interesting how in that THR article I linked to, the Snyders cite directorial independence.
AlyssaRosenberg	711958502890143744	2016-03-21T16:51:49	bonomoam It's hard for me to put any adapted material in that category, honestly. But that could just be me.
AlyssaRosenberg	711958300292751361	2016-03-21T16:51:00	life_of_tess Ahhh, then you're definitely not obligated to invite everyone!
AlyssaRosenberg	711957942367551488	2016-03-21T16:49:35	life_of_tess chloeangyal I'm Team Invite Everyone To Brunch; it's a kindness to folks who have traveled.
AlyssaRosenberg	711952051123650561	2016-03-21T16:26:11	Sk8j I totally get that reaction! There are a lot of reasons to find it offputting.
AlyssaRosenberg	711951633320697856	2016-03-21T16:24:31	Sk8j I'm mostly just curious how it might have been received in a different political moment for culture.
AlyssaRosenberg	711948164367052800	2016-03-21T16:10:44	besimmons Oh, I'm just curious about the overlap in the audiences. May write about it later this week.
AlyssaRosenberg	711946610276700160	2016-03-21T16:04:33	ben_brainerd I mean, read the post? It's not that long.

AlyssaRosenberg	711940609922232322	2016-03-21T15:40:43	misterpatches This is basically what I'm going to write.
AlyssaRosenberg	711940533002870784	2016-03-21T15:40:24	misterpatches Also, if Hamilton shakes up our notion of the founding fathers, Passing Strange shakes up preconceptions of a black musical.
AlyssaRosenberg	711939388666679296	2016-03-21T15:35:52	GenevieveKoski :)
AlyssaRosenberg	711938232733319168	2016-03-21T15:31:16	Poormojo I mean, it's just factually incorrect that the whole movie is a dream sequence, if that's what you're saying.
AlyssaRosenberg	711937771766734848	2016-03-21T15:29:26	andytgerm I just feel like PassingStrange has tons of stuff Hamilton fans would love, but didn't get quite the profile of InTheHeights.
AlyssaRosenberg	711937554208202753	2016-03-21T15:28:34	heybonanos I'm just curious about the overlap. Probably going to write something encouraging folks to check out PassingStrange.
AlyssaRosenberg	711937395319574528	2016-03-21T15:27:56	misterpatches Yes!
AlyssaRosenberg	711937280534048768	2016-03-21T15:27:29	Poormojo No. Not at all.
AlyssaRosenberg	711937172971118592	2016-03-21T15:27:03	AlyssaRosenberg by the end of the week it will be "Top dystopian landscapes in which there are no more commemorative forks to pack."
AlyssaRosenberg	711937198061461504	2016-03-21T15:27:09	misterpatches Yeah, I think I'm going to write something about it for later this week, because man should that show be in the conversation.
AlyssaRosenberg	711936777934741504	2016-03-21T15:25:29	Question for Hamilton fans on here: did you either see or watch PassingStrange when it was at the Belasco? Are you aware of it?
AlyssaRosenberg	711935267536572417	2016-03-21T15:19:29	CreedenceWard I mean, it's a great job, but it's still a job.
AlyssaRosenberg	711933455966330882	2016-03-21T15:12:17	I am moving and am totally exhausted, so this whole week is going to basically be posts that are fun for me to write.

AlyssaRosenberg	711932718205026306	2016-03-21T15:09:21	The chat's at 1, so get your questions in now: 
AlyssaRosenberg	711930914578759681	2016-03-21T15:02:11	gilbertcruz BilgeEbiri And I do think that the political context for culture (as well as everything else) has changed a ton since 2011.
AlyssaRosenberg	711930824984272896	2016-03-21T15:01:50	gilbertcruz BilgeEbiri Again, I wouldn't argue with it! I just wonder how it would play in a different political context.
AlyssaRosenberg	711928831830048768	2016-03-21T14:53:55	MattGertz Yeah, jsende already emailed me to say that he misread an announcement and thought you were running.
AlyssaRosenberg	711927251495985152	2016-03-21T14:47:38	I'm about halfway through my riseofcharmcity season and I'd been meaning to write abt what that feels like, so: 
AlyssaRosenberg	711926966413369345	2016-03-21T14:46:30	I totally forgot Oscar Isaac was in Sucker Punch and AlyssaRosenberg makes a great case for this movie: 
AlyssaRosenberg	711923173072179200	2016-03-21T14:31:26	gilbertcruz I would never blame anyone for not digging that movie, but it's really stuck with me in the five years since its release.
AlyssaRosenberg	711919950345203712	2016-03-21T14:18:37	I remember SUCKER PUNCH being attacked as sexist which, as AlyssaRosenberg notes, is almost exactly backwards. 
AlyssaRosenberg	711914524035698688	2016-03-21T13:57:03	Anyway, here's AlyssaRosenberg's essay again about how Michael Bay's Pain &amp; Gain explains Donald Trump: 
AlyssaRosenberg	711915160903000064	2016-03-21T13:59:35	How might Zack Snyder's SuckerPunch have played in a post-MadMaxFuryRoad world?  
AlyssaRosenberg	711890729082228737	2016-03-21T12:22:30	jsende SonnyBunch Heh, well, there *is* a Sucker-Punch related piece running on the blog this week.
AlyssaRosenberg	711608858519707648	2016-03-20T17:42:27	mikeyhaha1 Ufff, I am finding the second season of Daredevil sufficiently heavy lifting that I'm not sure I'm going to there for a bit.
AlyssaRosenberg	711298625846939648	2016-03-19T21:09:42	Moving is the very worst.
AlyssaRosenberg	711017069827862528	2016-03-19T02:30:54	Having GameofThrones almost back has one great perk: we can soon read again AlyssaRosenberg's weekly blog on the episodes.

AlyssaRosenberg	710996226905411586	2016-03-19T01:08:04	I had been trying to hold off on the Hamilton cast recording until I could see it but MattGertz put it on as packing music and I'm a goner
AlyssaRosenberg	710899438873677824	2016-03-18T18:43:28	The Washington Post is looking for a Europe correspondent based in Brussels, in case you're interested in a dope job 
AlyssaRosenberg	710916843960180736	2016-03-18T19:52:38	mattzollerseitz Well, "the goodness or badness of art is objective" canard is *also* one that needs to die.
AlyssaRosenberg	710915316122066944	2016-03-18T19:46:34	tlewisisdope It is my hopeless task to dash myself against these sorts of things in the hopes of change.

AlyssaRosenberg	710837783737323520	2016-03-18T14:38:29	This article nails it. Why do we consistently choke the humanity out of our leaders/candidates? It costs us.

AlyssaRosenberg	708323027549872129	2016-03-11T16:05:44	KateHarding I'm arguing she should do this because she seems to want to keep building the world but without writing more full-on books.

AlyssaRosenberg	704312051435327489	2016-02-29T14:27:33	Was Spotlight the best film of 2015? Who was your best actor/actress? Talking the Oscars w/AlyssaRosenberg.  
AlyssaRosenberg	704311477247811584	2016-02-29T14:25:16	jteeDC Yeah, as I wrote in my chat, the constraints of that job are just incredibly difficult.
AlyssaRosenberg	704306502274785280	2016-02-29T14:05:30	I'm about to be talking Oscars on Wisconsin Public Radio, if you're so inclined!
AlyssaRosenberg	704287192110260224	2016-02-29T12:48:46	Dear reader who signs herself "A very annoyed White person," I am not the right person to provide the Oscars coverage you're looking for.
AlyssaRosenberg	704287001353318401	2016-02-29T12:48:00	MrEAnders Thanks for that catch in the piece, updated accordingly.
AlyssaRosenberg	704284506086363136	2016-02-29T12:38:05	At last night's Oscars the conversation pivoted from race to gender:

AlyssaRosenberg	704167355203657730	2016-02-29T04:52:34	Whoever wins this category has a big asterisk next to their name without Michael B. Jordan as the competition. Oscars
AlyssaRosenberg	704167225100541954	2016-02-29T04:52:03	Julianne Moore gets "Mrs. Robinson," huh?
AlyssaRosenberg	704166241716604928	2016-02-29T04:48:09	We are so blessed to get to see the coming decades of Brie Larson's career. I am thrilled. Oscars

AlyssaRosenberg	704160831991209984	2016-02-29T04:26:39	How on earth was the original song from “Love &amp; Mercy” not even NOMINATED here? Oscars

AlyssaRosenberg	704155272793690112	2016-02-29T04:04:34	Abraham Attah is excellent in BeastsOfNoNation, in case you haven't watched it.
AlyssaRosenberg	704155111359000576	2016-02-29T04:03:55	Time for the most adorable part of the evening: Jacob Tremblay and Abraham Attah. Oscars

AlyssaRosenberg	704153394659905537	2016-02-29T03:57:06	Also, I think "diversity" is failing as a rubric for reform in the the entertainment industry. The language isn't blunt or specific. Oscars
AlyssaRosenberg	704152924038021120	2016-02-29T03:55:14	Phanto Yes. Yes I would.
AlyssaRosenberg	704152760460165120	2016-02-29T03:54:35	mlmcreynolds Not me, sadly. But he's been great.
AlyssaRosenberg	704152680009240576	2016-02-29T03:54:16	I dearly wish Cheryl Boone Isaacs would name names instead of just saying that "everyone" is responsible for equity. Oscars
AlyssaRosenberg	704152187333640193	2016-02-29T03:52:18	Once more: how dare the Academy not have the honorary winners there? They can't each get their 45 seconds in person?
AlyssaRosenberg	704152388052131840	2016-02-29T03:53:06	Glad to see the Oscars airing the section of Spike Lee's speech about the monochrome nature of movie studio executive ranks.
AlyssaRosenberg	704151672889724928	2016-02-29T03:50:15	mlmcreynolds Is it for me telling that guy to stop trying to diminish the feminism of MadMax? I don't normally go that hard at someone...
AlyssaRosenberg	704151348581900288	2016-02-29T03:48:58	So TheCatch is a long-form TheThomasCrownAffair? I could get with that.
AlyssaRosenberg	704151241396506624	2016-02-29T03:48:33	I watched Amy on my way to my honeymoon because clearly I don't understand what basking in joy means. Oscars

AlyssaRosenberg	704146623870455809	2016-02-29T03:30:12	Steve Carrell should have been nominated for his work in TheBigShort. Just saying.
AlyssaRosenberg	704145032593477632	2016-02-29T03:23:52	Guy in my feed saying MadMaxFuryRoad is incidentally feminist, you should probably listen to George Miller himself. Oscars

AlyssaRosenberg	704143392591187968	2016-02-29T03:17:21	It is really difficult to adequately describe in words how bad FiftyShadesOfGrey was. Oscars
AlyssaRosenberg	704142250947821568	2016-02-29T03:12:49	I cried as hard all three times I saw InsideOut as I did when the 1994 LittleWomen came out when I was ten. Oscars

AlyssaRosenberg	704141118053740544	2016-02-29T03:08:19	(In re: that last Tweet, yes, I am the non-fictional Leslie Knope, but you knew that already.)
AlyssaRosenberg	704140801895440384	2016-02-29T03:07:04	As someone who was a Girl Scout all the way through 12th grade and a regular cookie-sales champ, I am very happy right now. Oscars
AlyssaRosenberg	704140008966529025	2016-02-29T03:03:55	KarenAttiah (Also, if my chat is any indication, it's definitely getting under people's skin. Which suggests the challenge.)
AlyssaRosenberg	704139893300174848	2016-02-29T03:03:27	KarenAttiah I guess my expectations were always going to be moderated. This is a giant corporate product. The lines were always delineated.
AlyssaRosenberg	704138905285750784	2016-02-29T02:59:31	KarenAttiah Well, Boone Isaacs will be out later tonight. We'll see what happens.
AlyssaRosenberg	704138074264084480	2016-02-29T02:56:13	Can we please find a way to recognize already that what Andy Serkis does in motion capture is acting? Oscars maybenotassnokethough
AlyssaRosenberg	704136855177056256	2016-02-29T02:51:23	Mad Max Fury Road has now won more Oscars than any movie last year.
AlyssaRosenberg	704136464456617985	2016-02-29T02:49:50	
AlyssaRosenberg	704136286878171136	2016-02-29T02:49:07	KarenAttiah Do you really feel that's what's happening? I think it's a great showcase for talent the industry has overlooked or misused.
AlyssaRosenberg	704136182867828737	2016-02-29T02:48:42	This is a really good illustration of what sound editing does for a movie. Oscars
AlyssaRosenberg	704135932233031681	2016-02-29T02:47:43	TeresaKopec Yes, I really did.
AlyssaRosenberg	704135246950875137	2016-02-29T02:44:59	I liked WhiskeyTangoFoxtrot quite a bit, apropos of this ad.
AlyssaRosenberg	704134648448851969	2016-02-29T02:42:37	Turns out you can make a completely badass action movie about women, with women in key roles, that will do well overseas! Oscars
AlyssaRosenberg	704134302037053441	2016-02-29T02:41:14	Look at all these women up on stage for MadMaxFuryRoad. My heart is expanding a size every time they go up there to collect gold. Oscars

AlyssaRosenberg	704130796932698114	2016-02-29T02:27:18	slb79 katelinnea No, because it's a movie with a crew of female heroes (not all of whom are white).

AlyssaRosenberg	704123944845119489	2016-02-29T02:00:05	I will say, any call-back to Tracy Jordan as Oprah or as Thomas Jefferson makes me very, very happy. Oscars
AlyssaRosenberg	704122117000970240	2016-02-29T01:52:49	Hooray for TheBigShort! I went long with GhostPanther about the movie here:  Oscars

AlyssaRosenberg	702236237193748480	2016-02-23T20:59:00	What's the Yiddish blessing for "may you never be on the receiving end of an unfavourable AlyssaRosenberg review"? 
AlyssaRosenberg	702229864296947714	2016-02-23T20:33:41	danielthomsen You will both look so jaunty. I feel like he might appreciate the Tiny Office.
AlyssaRosenberg	702229002791034881	2016-02-23T20:30:15	danielthomsen If you can get Pitbull to go to dinner with you, I will send you guys a bottle of wine in exchange for a detailed debrief.
AlyssaRosenberg	702227906731368448	2016-02-23T20:25:54	danielthomsen You mean the two of us? Or you and him?
AlyssaRosenberg	702225582050963456	2016-02-23T20:16:40	AlyssaRosenberg I could be fighting crime, and you could put on one of Pitbull's catchier music videos and I would be fatally distracted.
AlyssaRosenberg	702224909464903680	2016-02-23T20:13:59	If I were a superhero, my fatal weakness would be bad pop stars who actually bother to wear suits.
AlyssaRosenberg	702212396107096066	2016-02-23T19:24:16	danieltwalters Fair enough! My dreams of a Mellie-Olivia teamup do appear to be coming true.
AlyssaRosenberg	702212139604434944	2016-02-23T19:23:15	In case you wondered whether my husband or I have more influence on the media: the answer is him. 
AlyssaRosenberg	702210281401884672	2016-02-23T19:15:52	Thank you to my editing committee of scottmeslow michelledean SonnyBunch and MattGertz for the help on that last link.
AlyssaRosenberg	702209572778409985	2016-02-23T19:13:03	This is the nice version of this review. Which is saying something:  
AlyssaRosenberg	702200520488845312	2016-02-23T18:37:04	Yes, although all stories higher than the Capitol must be gold plated 
AlyssaRosenberg	702200083140452353	2016-02-23T18:35:20	My hope for Donald Trump's presidency is that he spends his entire term in office going to war against DC's height restrictions.
AlyssaRosenberg	702194387854479361	2016-02-23T18:12:42	I find both Chris Brown and product integration odious, and yet at least once a month, have an incredible craving for "Forever."
AlyssaRosenberg	702189176985415680	2016-02-23T17:52:00	frankrebecca For tickets.
AlyssaRosenberg	702188527396720641	2016-02-23T17:49:25	Any other Amtrak riders, has it suddenly become weirdly impossible to redeem guest rewards points, or am I just missing something?
AlyssaRosenberg	702181765285355520	2016-02-23T17:22:33	poniewozik It's so many appearances! 
AlyssaRosenberg	702180530276712449	2016-02-23T17:17:38	nprmonkeysee People seem weirdly uninterested in that, even when we did a huge supercut of Trump in pre-Apprentice movies and TV!
AlyssaRosenberg	702168820228747264	2016-02-23T16:31:07	newsie78 I adore it; it still feels fresh after many re-readings.
AlyssaRosenberg	702166482319499265	2016-02-23T16:21:49	Lauren Ambrose would be better as Cathy in TheInterestings than as Jules, in my humble opinion.
AlyssaRosenberg	702164535180980227	2016-02-23T16:14:05	maryloubethune Again, more than half of the shows I'm writing about in that piece are about people older than that.
AlyssaRosenberg	702163345223323648	2016-02-23T16:09:21	maryloubethune None of the shows discussed in this piece are YA in genre.
AlyssaRosenberg	702162627741491200	2016-02-23T16:06:30	(Also, Alison PIll should obviously play Jules in Amazon's adaptation of TheInterestings.)
AlyssaRosenberg	702162538390233088	2016-02-23T16:06:09	Jessica Pare as Ash in an adaptation of The Interestings makes sense to me, but Jules is one who actually matters: 
AlyssaRosenberg	702158963765284864	2016-02-23T15:51:57	CitizenJustine Well, thanks, lady! That means a ton.
AlyssaRosenberg	702150064744042498	2016-02-23T15:16:35	This is a good, sanity-restoring column on the Oscars from Glenn__Kenny: 
AlyssaRosenberg	702147791628476417	2016-02-23T15:07:33	When people are agitating to not be killed,there's something vile about encouraging them to be more like a person who was killed.
AlyssaRosenberg	702146768797114368	2016-02-23T15:03:29	It's fascinating to me that as UPS/USPS tracking has gotten more sophisticated, truck shipping has yet--seemingly--to catch up.
AlyssaRosenberg	702146136203784192	2016-02-23T15:00:58	Prestige comedies have become as cliche and predictable as anti-hero dramas:

AlyssaRosenberg	701854230013939712	2016-02-22T19:41:02	Not sure I expected to find a picture of a giant, apparently sentient penis in an email from a publicist, but there we are.
AlyssaRosenberg	701846703872176128	2016-02-22T19:11:08	.AlyssaRosenberg I emailed with Prof. Hill about this 7 years ago.

AlyssaRosenberg	701844476487143424	2016-02-22T19:02:17	What Kesha tells us about the wisdom of appointing Anita Hill to the Supreme Court:  
AlyssaRosenberg	701826658110726148	2016-02-22T17:51:29	Chat's starting at 1! Come hang out: 
AlyssaRosenberg	701818210610503681	2016-02-22T17:17:55	Has someone put together a full menu for Scandal's fictional fast-food chain Gettysburger? ABC should do a Gettysburger food truck.
AlyssaRosenberg	701812252098297857	2016-02-22T16:54:14	sarahccaldwell Yeah, or at least rooted for Mellie.
AlyssaRosenberg	701811522801156096	2016-02-22T16:51:20	(Also, I am currently amused by Scandal's depiction of the washingtonpost.)
AlyssaRosenberg	701811105916657664	2016-02-22T16:49:41	If Scandal had been this five years ago, I think I'd have been using the ideas to downplay the problems. Not that kind of critic anymore.
AlyssaRosenberg	701809741094395905	2016-02-22T16:44:15	Scandal has become the sort of show that I don't necessarily *enjoy* anymore, but that is just full of intriguing ideas.
AlyssaRosenberg	701809642041712641	2016-02-22T16:43:52	ElliotKort :)
AlyssaRosenberg	701807930274877440	2016-02-22T16:37:04	hiattf I think TeamEdith should be an official stance of the editorial board.

AlyssaRosenberg	701790845821919233	2016-02-22T15:29:10	How Lady Edith became the hero of DowntonAbbey:  
AlyssaRosenberg	701785443126353920	2016-02-22T15:07:42	katekilla It's a really outstanding time to be here, I think.

AlyssaRosenberg	698243069712457732	2016-02-12T20:31:35	youthinkmemad Yeah, the casting would be so difficult. I love the idea someone floated of casting Alison Brie as Jennifer Walters, though.
AlyssaRosenberg	698242341648216065	2016-02-12T20:28:41	AlyssaRosenberg It would be great if they did a Bixby/Ferigno thing -- and had alisonbrie as Jennifer Walters with mo-cap Schumer Shulk

AlyssaRosenberg	698241160792375296	2016-02-12T20:24:00	youthinkmemad I think she could do the raw edge of She-Hulk comedy really well. Who would you cast instead?
AlyssaRosenberg	698240751000535041	2016-02-12T20:22:22	I honestly don't know why the thought of Amy Schumer as She-Hulk didn't occur to me sooner. With the right director, it could be perfection.
AlyssaRosenberg	698240568695070720	2016-02-12T20:21:38	The tracking on Deadpool makes the best possible case for a She-Hulk movie. Possibly one starring Amy Schumer.

AlyssaRosenberg	694196646461075456	2016-02-01T16:32:32	"We've created something unique that has huge value for the subscriber." -Bezos on the success of Amazon Prime
AlyssaRosenberg	694196390814089216	2016-02-01T16:31:31	On diversity issues today, Bezos has been very quick to acknowledge issues, and absolutely cut off all discussions of solutions.
AlyssaRosenberg	694195670324899842	2016-02-01T16:28:39	"We have the same issues many companies have with under-representation of women, of African-Americans." -Bezos on Amazon's executive ranks

AlyssaRosenberg	694192843766693893	2016-02-01T16:17:26	Bezos also predicts that the washingtonpost is going to have hundreds of millions of readers.
AlyssaRosenberg	694192750145568768	2016-02-01T16:17:03	Bezos says it's healthier for washingtonpost to make a small amount of money on a very large group of readers than the reverse.

AlyssaRosenberg	694184572485967872	2016-02-01T15:44:34	"Principles trump metrics. [But] only really bad business people ignore metrics." -Jeff Bezos, at the washingtonpost right now
AlyssaRosenberg	694184247704231936	2016-02-01T15:43:16	Bezos says that the Post needs to run like a TV model-if something is someone's absolute favorite, it doesn't need 20 million viewers.
AlyssaRosenberg	694183896255049728	2016-02-01T15:41:52	Bezos also says that there are things principal compels you to do, traffics be darned.
AlyssaRosenberg	694183675198451712	2016-02-01T15:41:00	At washingtonpost again today, Jeff Bezos says we need to serve both the bundle (our subscribers) and a la carte traffic via social.

AlyssaRosenberg	689527076383121408	2016-01-19T19:17:20	faryl Indeed.
AlyssaRosenberg	689526778478522368	2016-01-19T19:16:09	jteeDC And I agree that's a risk. Thus all of the only if people feel sincerely moved disclaimers.
AlyssaRosenberg	689526390056550400	2016-01-19T19:14:36	jteeDC Obviously I don't disagree.
AlyssaRosenberg	689525452621221888	2016-01-19T19:10:53	jteeDC Yeah, it's possible. I would just like folks to feel like there's the onus on them to do something classy.
AlyssaRosenberg	689525368739368960	2016-01-19T19:10:33	faryl I'm not saying it's the only thing that should happen. But it strikes me as a start.
AlyssaRosenberg	689523227371003904	2016-01-19T19:02:02	A classy way white Oscar nominees could respond to the planned boycott: 
AlyssaRosenberg	689507503353102336	2016-01-19T17:59:33	jonlustig Well, and it's hard to discuss because it implicates other people's decision-making process.
AlyssaRosenberg	689502188796674048	2016-01-19T17:38:26	jonlustig Yeah, no question.
AlyssaRosenberg	689500905578737665	2016-01-19T17:33:20	jonlustig You know that I'm basically impossible to argue with! And I am so grateful to my parents for their financial literacy lessons.
AlyssaRosenberg	689500142987120641	2016-01-19T17:30:19	jonlustig I completely agree with this.

AlyssaRosenberg	688924559987322880	2016-01-18T03:23:09	AoDespair Yeah, I spent three years reporting on federal performance management systems. No one does this well. No one.
AlyssaRosenberg	688923868480860161	2016-01-18T03:20:24	AoDespair But just thinking out loud, of course.
AlyssaRosenberg	688923784288534529	2016-01-18T03:20:04	AoDespair I wonder if that's an intellectual framework that could be that fork, if you know what I mean.
AlyssaRosenberg	688923627056680960	2016-01-18T03:19:26	AoDespair Yes, and what struck me about Lavoy is the way she made an argument that we've been tough on the wrong crimes.
AlyssaRosenberg	688923421191852032	2016-01-18T03:18:37	AoDespair  don't read you that way. Just felt like Lavoy's framing is useful and would be nice to see the ideas get a bigger platform.

AlyssaRosenberg	688027841833873409	2016-01-15T15:59:55	Wordbeast I'm all about very careful readings of text. But there has to be evidence for the argument you want to make!

AlyssaRosenberg	688027136653918210	2016-01-15T15:57:06	Look, reading stuff into other people's work that is not, in fact, there, makes *you* appear extremely foolish. It's not a gotcha.

AlyssaRosenberg	688025924097445890	2016-01-15T15:52:17	BK00023 I didn't! I've heard reasonably good things.
AlyssaRosenberg	688025453114863616	2016-01-15T15:50:25	If you want to amble into my mentions and be predictable, you *must* know what my response will be:

AlyssaRosenberg	687745354964414464	2016-01-14T21:17:24	It's always weird to me when people do this. I'm not trying to sneak anything by you, I swear! What I write is what I actually mean!
AlyssaRosenberg	687745073883123712	2016-01-14T21:16:17	People are very good at projecting what they expect from a piece into it instead of just reading the darn thing and taking what's there.
AlyssaRosenberg	687734469718077440	2016-01-14T20:34:09	AJStoughton Oh, he's mentioned in the piece, just wanted to call attention to another performance that wasn't in the conversation.
AlyssaRosenberg	687717504324468736	2016-01-14T19:26:44	If you don't believe good acting or writing can happen in genres or on topics you consider lightweight, we have little to say to each other.
AlyssaRosenberg	687699755124699136	2016-01-14T18:16:13	That thing where you thought you had one interview to transcribe but actually there are two.
AlyssaRosenberg	687680938642247680	2016-01-14T17:01:26	One of the hardest thing to know is when an observation in a piece needs to be cut and become a separate post.

AlyssaRosenberg	687658566631591937	2016-01-14T15:32:33	Oh, the hell with the Oscars. Here are 7 performances by black actors I loved in 2015:  
AlyssaRosenberg	687646201185996803	2016-01-14T14:43:24	Note: "The Academy" doesn't watch COMPTON &amp; say, "Ehh, give the white people screenplay." WRITERS honor the movie; other branches ignore it.
AlyssaRosenberg	687644195138355200	2016-01-14T14:35:26	emilynussbaum Oh, I know, I just mean that TV can respond to demand and pressure faster.
AlyssaRosenberg	687643523282173953	2016-01-14T14:32:46	Dirk2112 Yeah, it had a theatrical release.
AlyssaRosenberg	687642607061614593	2016-01-14T14:29:07	emilynussbaum Some of that is lead time, I think? TV can go from conception to being in front of audiences much faster.
AlyssaRosenberg	687642474244878336	2016-01-14T14:28:36	When it comes to racial &amp; gender diversity, television is so far ahead of movies that it's bizarre. &amp; a lot of that is about the last 5 yrs.
AlyssaRosenberg	687642271177699328	2016-01-14T14:27:47	but that said, the fact that the only nominations for Straight Outta Compton and Creed went to white people shoiuld not go unnoticed.
AlyssaRosenberg	687641767244505088	2016-01-14T14:25:47	MarkHarrisNYC Yeah, this is what gets at me. There just wasn't that much to choose from. And a few campaigns felt like stretches.
AlyssaRosenberg	687641635308597248	2016-01-14T14:25:16	Last thing on this point: This is an Oscar problem ONLY as a reflection of an industry problem. The nominations change when the films do,&gt;&gt;
AlyssaRosenberg	687641660843376640	2016-01-14T14:25:22	Maybe I should assemble a support team to go see TheRevenant with me.
AlyssaRosenberg	687640345073471488	2016-01-14T14:20:08	SilvestriWoman Honestly? That was not one of the best performances by an actor this year to me.

AlyssaRosenberg	687637694394966016	2016-01-14T14:09:36	But if something is just really hard for me to even look at directly, I tend to feel like it's not fair for me to write about it.
AlyssaRosenberg	687637605354090496	2016-01-14T14:09:15	I'm okay with reviewing things that I know are not for me, and will try to judge them on their terms (see, 13Hours on which more tomorrow).
AlyssaRosenberg	687637445744005120	2016-01-14T14:08:37	In re: TheRevenant, I do extremely poorly with brutal violence, and because I know that about myself, I generally bow out.
AlyssaRosenberg	687637009997774848	2016-01-14T14:06:53	Oscar bummers: Missed opportunities on Creed, Jennifer Lawrence's nod for an unworthy film, the fact that I now have to see TheRevenant.
