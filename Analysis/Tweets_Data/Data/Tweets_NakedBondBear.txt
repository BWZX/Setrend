NakedBondBear	717126033015717888	2016-04-04T23:05:44	bondskew And Capital Markets guys aren’t any better always pushing their book at that moment. munilass SapienQuis
NakedBondBear	717125849875484673	2016-04-04T23:05:00	bondskew And the GOP congress. It took two for that hideous dance. munilass SapienQuis
NakedBondBear	717125744875405314	2016-04-04T23:04:35	bondskew Then GOP &amp; FED runs with it and stops any regulator from trying to slow things down munilass SapienQuis
NakedBondBear	717125530823356416	2016-04-04T23:03:44	bondskew Exactly. First they fuck up getting rid of Glass-Seagle. munilass SapienQuis
NakedBondBear	717125291437662212	2016-04-04T23:02:47	My prediction, mortgages will require another fucking bailout. Neither party has enough combined IQ points to let the market be the market.
NakedBondBear	717124687503953920	2016-04-04T23:00:23	bondskew I assume even regulators have to follow the law sometimes when not watching porn. munilass SapienQuis
NakedBondBear	717124547120668674	2016-04-04T22:59:50	bondskew The problem is the law. The MBS blowup was so bad, pols overcame their bribes and had to “DO” something munilass SapienQuis
NakedBondBear	717123577951158272	2016-04-04T22:55:59	Anyone paying attention? I don’t thinks so. Even our precious munis and sovereigns will get hit. Right munilass. Kiss it all good by.
NakedBondBear	717123282789646336	2016-04-04T22:54:48	Lower home prices leads to more gov’t involvement because the hacks at the NAR and NAHB need the transactions and will pay pols for it
NakedBondBear	717122999829327872	2016-04-04T22:53:41	Without Agency MBS trading desks, liquidity in mortgages will decrease. This will lead to higher rates which leads to lower home prices.
NakedBondBear	717122600099557376	2016-04-04T22:52:06	The never ending conservatorship of the GSEs with its diminishing GSE corporate debt has made Agency MBS desks not profitable.
NakedBondBear	717122275040952321	2016-04-04T22:50:48	The manufactured low rate environment by central pants have caused too thin margins. Even Agency MBS is going away.
NakedBondBear	717121737855516673	2016-04-04T22:48:40	In case you haven’t paying attention, major shops including GS are turning their once mighty fixed income shops into ghost towns.
NakedBondBear	717121342752030721	2016-04-04T22:47:06	Be very scared kids. Uncle Naked Bond Bear has some very bad news and the losers in gov’t aren’t paying attention. Fixed Income is fucked
NakedBondBear	714208059858558976	2016-03-27T21:50:45	Hey SapienQuis Glad to see the gov’t hasn’t killed your spirit.
NakedBondBear	714205883610304512	2016-03-27T21:42:06	Who missed me?
NakedBondBear	501538477868335104	2014-08-19T01:17:45	RPA_CRE You are correct. LIBOR will rise once banks aren’t going to be held liable to LIBOR securities.
NakedBondBear	501533709456388097	2014-08-19T00:58:49	I love that 1 Month LIBOR is 0.155. Especially for all those companies still holding on to originally purchased Subprime.
NakedBondBear	501531357504622593	2014-08-19T00:49:28	Does MSFT know how shitty Win 8 is? Bueller?
NakedBondBear	498557364120064002	2014-08-10T19:51:53	scoopercooper With the increased hostilities around the world, I agree. Looks like the GSE risk sharing isn’t nearly as attractive too.
NakedBondBear	498318111779856384	2014-08-10T04:01:10	scoopercooper Too many damn crazy world events to accurately predict. At the beginning of the year I predicted mid year to be over 3%.
NakedBondBear	498264320808345602	2014-08-10T00:27:26	I’m back and I’m pissed.

NakedBondBear	419821321355546624	2014-01-05T13:22:57	Like DeBlasio, I'm willing to give Director Watt a chance before declaring his tenure a failure. You listening Fox News?
NakedBondBear	419817562437091328	2014-01-05T13:08:01	Tomorrow starts the reign of FHFA's new director Mel Watt.  FHFA has gone from a finance guy to an economist to a politician.  Deevolution.
