RKWinvisibleman	715531953957650433	2016-03-31T13:31:26	It was therefore essential to ensure that the actors were proportionately sized.
RKWinvisibleman	715531868276436992	2016-03-31T13:31:05	The reason for casting short actors is that Kubrick and NASA had constructed a landing module that was too small.

RKWinvisibleman	703591021968363521	2016-02-27T14:42:26	10) Now GOP seems headed to debacle - conservatism to crackup - and the best advice we hear is, “Talk more about Trump University.”

RKWinvisibleman	703586187089281024	2016-02-27T14:23:13	4) Congressional Republicans self-deluded that they can save themselves even if top of ticket craters - or splits.
