mattzollerseitz	723558677211451392	2016-04-22T17:06:46	Indeed. The lesson of Prince is not "music should be free." It's "artists should be paid what they're worth." 
mattzollerseitz	723558603731415040	2016-04-22T17:06:28	If you have never paid a dime for any of Prince's music, don't celebrate what he meant to you. It's hypocritical.

mattzollerseitz	723558365071327232	2016-04-22T17:05:31	It is very interesting how every single argument about IP invariably leads to people saying "which is why I don't have to pay for this art."
mattzollerseitz	723558154093604864	2016-04-22T17:04:41	One aspect of Prince's individuality that fans can't accept is his insistence that you pay for his music. Attitude is "fuck it, he's dead."
mattzollerseitz	723557554899529728	2016-04-22T17:02:18	Kenjh71 thedailybeast yeah, fuck his estate, he's dead, amirite?
mattzollerseitz	723557080242774016	2016-04-22T17:00:25	Despite Prince's vigorous defense of his own intellectually property, his "fans" use his WB feud as an excuse not to pay for his music.
mattzollerseitz	723556501332320257	2016-04-22T16:58:07	thedailybeast Because he wanted you to pay for his creativity and his labor. Shocking.

mattzollerseitz	717115774482124801	2016-04-04T22:24:58	"De facto" is a dangerous wiggle-phrase. Gotta use it carefully, never as a  means of forcing words to mean what you want them to mean.

mattzollerseitz	713838423111561217	2016-03-26T21:21:57	"Fan theory" is ultimately an attempt to make a film submit to you, rather than give in to it. "I alone have mastered this work. Behold."

mattzollerseitz	713707707384078336	2016-03-26T12:42:32	"Critics don't matter." This is always uttered in reference to a critic's ability to impact box office, which no critic cares about.
