JakeSherman	711975262456565760	2016-03-21T17:58:25	BuzzFeedAndrew megynkelly OK. you are allowed to disagree
JakeSherman	711974865046282240	2016-03-21T17:56:50	So, to repeat, this meeting attracted Trump supporters.  
JakeSherman	711967860499869696	2016-03-21T17:29:00	DeMint is meeting w Trump, aide says, but it does not mean he is endorsing him. Aide says it is part of effort to discuss conservative ideas

JakeSherman	711947313040760832	2016-03-21T16:07:21	Interesting tidbit. Jones Day - where Trump is having mtg - repped Aaron Schock when he left congress. Trump's lawyer was on his legal team
JakeSherman	711946587984031744	2016-03-21T16:04:28	that’s the reporter from the player tribune, right 
JakeSherman	711943635797987328	2016-03-21T15:52:44	the House Freedom Caucus has LONG been close to Cruz. they believe, as many do, Trump is not a conservative.  
JakeSherman	711940435283988480	2016-03-21T15:40:01	So this Trump meeting is not really an opportunity to woo the establishment. It’s all people who have endorsed him.

JakeSherman	711903369246466048	2016-03-21T13:12:44	this is the least surprising tweet you will read today. 
JakeSherman	711892769699184640	2016-03-21T12:30:37	This Trump confab at Jones Day would be convenient for lawmakers — except Senate is out of session and the House doesn’t come in until 630.
JakeSherman	711889878267596802	2016-03-21T12:19:07	So many stories about how Israel Hayom = Adelson, support Trump. People forget the other Adelson paper "Makor Rishon" which ripped Trump.
