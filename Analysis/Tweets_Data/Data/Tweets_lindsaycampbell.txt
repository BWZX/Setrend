lindsaycampbell	688861258519564288	2016-01-17T23:11:37	lindsaycampbell ooh, and, also interesting: conserv. reactions are advantageous traits for a group, I.e. will outcompete groups without 'em
lindsaycampbell	688855345666592768	2016-01-17T22:48:07	lindsaycampbell interesting upshot is that no amount of rational debate is going to change minds, cos the opinions are caused by emotions
lindsaycampbell	688855098622087168	2016-01-17T22:47:08	lindsaycampbell he shows how these emotional responses were useful, evolutionarily, and how they now fire whenever we discuss politics
lindsaycampbell	688854761744035840	2016-01-17T22:45:48	lindsaycampbell .."personal autonomy (freedom)", "sanctity" (ie some concepts are too important to be damaged, impugned, tainted, etc)
lindsaycampbell	688853619718901760	2016-01-17T22:41:15	lindsaycampbell whereas conservatives driven by all six of the moral emotional responses he has identified, incl. "respect for authority"..
lindsaycampbell	688853219322261506	2016-01-17T22:39:40	lindsaycampbell Liberals primarily driven by emotions to "care for the helpless" &amp; "justice for all"
lindsaycampbell	688852599584518144	2016-01-17T22:37:12	lindsaycampbell He demonstrated we are all driven by impulsive emotional responses, which we rationalise after the fact with our "opinions"
lindsaycampbell	688851785029697536	2016-01-17T22:33:58	lindsaycampbell biggest insight I've ever has is the book "the righteous mind", about why we all find it impossible to agree on basics
lindsaycampbell	688827063722102784	2016-01-17T20:55:44	Sincerely want to understand how this bumper sticker - "Pro God, Pro Life, Pro Gun"- makes any sense. A little help from my conserv friends?
