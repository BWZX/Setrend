sarahjeong	725863571658145792	2016-04-29T01:45:36	csoghoian it's an expansion of an existing statute that covers bomb threats made over interstate telecommunications. adopts same penalties.

sarahjeong	725616413625344000	2016-04-28T09:23:28	josephfcox whereas child porn is the documentation of something that is already a crime
sarahjeong	725616333476368384	2016-04-28T09:23:09	josephfcox because revenge porn isn't a federal crime, and the element of nonconsensuality goes towards distribution

sarahjeong	720367240546095108	2016-04-13T21:45:08	DEVELOPING STORY: Matthew Keys sentenced to two years in prison for computer hacking. 
sarahjeong	720361726093316097	2016-04-13T21:23:13	Keys is to surrender on June 15, 2016.
sarahjeong	720361123472547841	2016-04-13T21:20:50	BREAKING: MatthewKeysLive has been sentenced to two years in prison.
sarahjeong	720360957973663744	2016-04-13T21:20:10	SENTENCE: 24 months.
sarahjeong	720358775266250752	2016-04-13T21:11:30	"Any time behind bars for Mr. Keys would be significant."
sarahjeong	720358730588553216	2016-04-13T21:11:19	Judge: "Has he learned his lesson? This is a question the court is considering."
sarahjeong	720358140181553153	2016-04-13T21:08:58	sentence is coming down
sarahjeong	720357925332475904	2016-04-13T21:08:07	I'm sitting in a row with an Ars Technica journalist and a Buzzfeed journalist and I'm 100% sure the AUSA hasn't heard of any of us
sarahjeong	720357450075869184	2016-04-13T21:06:14	To be fair, the prosecutor didn't know what the fuck Vice was either
sarahjeong	720357395537375232	2016-04-13T21:06:01	Defense is pointing to Keys's recent work as a journalist and prosecutor said that it's all citations to sites he's never heard of
sarahjeong	720357289882820608	2016-04-13T21:05:36	oh my god
sarahjeong	720356589941600257	2016-04-13T21:02:49	lmao now Leiderman is talking about phone phreaking and Jobs and Wozniak
sarahjeong	720355823445082113	2016-04-13T20:59:46	Judge: "I think the parties agree, it’s not the crime of the century."
sarahjeong	720354999067226112	2016-04-13T20:56:29	Keys has lost his 20s, the best years of his life. And perhaps a chunk of his 30s.
sarahjeong	720354746733756418	2016-04-13T20:55:29	Defense: "Not only is his record clean, but in the interceding 5 ½ years when he’s grown up into a 29 year old he hasn’t done anything."
sarahjeong	720354708339097601	2016-04-13T20:55:20	Says Keys was an immature 22 year old and has grown up since.
sarahjeong	720353313007382528	2016-04-13T20:49:47	Judge say, "He was hired as a social media… wunderkind."
sarahjeong	720353285123612672	2016-04-13T20:49:41	Prosecution and defense disagree as to what role Keys played at Fox 40. Prosecutor says "site admin," defense says "content provider"
sarahjeong	720352917207691265	2016-04-13T20:48:13	One of these cases might go to the Supreme Court, "why not us?"
sarahjeong	720352838463856641	2016-04-13T20:47:54	Says that prosecution cannot ask Keys to apologize given that they are seeking a potentially ground-breaking appeal on CFAA grounds.
sarahjeong	720352494019194880	2016-04-13T20:46:32	"The CFAA is a buggy law... with that, the punishments do not fit the crime."
sarahjeong	720352392009490433	2016-04-13T20:46:08	"Although there have been proposals for remediation, no action has been taken."
sarahjeong	720352372870918149	2016-04-13T20:46:03	Going into the CFAA now. "Congress is regressive not progressive, and in fact they are completely inactive nowadays."
sarahjeong	720352022193512449	2016-04-13T20:44:40	Leiderman is comparing Samberg sharing his HBO password as a joke to what Keys did.
sarahjeong	720351583372849152	2016-04-13T20:42:55	Defense: "This belief that this is a targeting of journalists is a belief he is entitled to have… this isn’t an attack on the jury…"
sarahjeong	720351350991638530	2016-04-13T20:42:00	(Prosecutor said that Keys had attacked the jury system itself).
sarahjeong	720351209324843009	2016-04-13T20:41:26	Leiderman is now defending Matthew Keys's tweets since the verdict
sarahjeong	720350932765028357	2016-04-13T20:40:20	Leiderman: "The government gives Matthew Keys way too much credit in his ability to influence public discourse"
sarahjeong	720350767979233280	2016-04-13T20:39:41	The still unknown individual who actually defaced the LAT website using Keys's login 
sarahjeong	720350511153545218	2016-04-13T20:38:39	Leiderman now
sarahjeong	720350460398309376	2016-04-13T20:38:27	"The only thing that limited his crime was that sharpie didn’t want to hurt the LA Times as much as Keys did."
sarahjeong	720350374402465792	2016-04-13T20:38:07	"This is not just a prank. We might be talking about a prank if this were sharpie’s sentencing. I think prank captures what sharpie did."
sarahjeong	720350294303834113	2016-04-13T20:37:48	Prosecutor: "This wasn’t mischief. This was rage driven by profound narcissism."
sarahjeong	720349853214085120	2016-04-13T20:36:03	Concedes that 36 month sentence is also reasonable. Prosecutor is basically hoping for *any* prison time now.
sarahjeong	720349425105653760	2016-04-13T20:34:21	"We have not gone overboard on this case and a midrange recommendation doesn’t go overboard either."
sarahjeong	720349212299255808	2016-04-13T20:33:30	When pressed to give recommendation based on guidelines range the court came up with, prosecutor recommends 42 month sentence
sarahjeong	720344958150905861	2016-04-13T20:16:36	Wrap-up arguments.
sarahjeong	720344801913098241	2016-04-13T20:15:58	"We are one of the few points of stability on the web... for our industry it’s crucial that we be a beacon in a confusing world."
sarahjeong	720344577962414081	2016-04-13T20:15:05	Gaines says there's already a problem with ascertaining what is real news, defacing a credible news organization's site is a real threat
sarahjeong	720344275322470401	2016-04-13T20:13:53	Gaines on behalf of the LA Times is saying that defacing the news website was an attack on the fourth estate
sarahjeong	720344057310937089	2016-04-13T20:13:01	Brandon Mercer's written statement was read aloud. Dan Gaines from LAT now giving a statement.
sarahjeong	720341442917326853	2016-04-13T20:02:37	Victim statements now.
sarahjeong	720341230635208705	2016-04-13T20:01:47	this is such a long fucking sentencing
sarahjeong	720330904342646786	2016-04-13T19:20:45	30 minute break for lunch.
sarahjeong	720330745433075712	2016-04-13T19:20:07	Nah dude, *she* is asking questions about this, she wants to know more 
sarahjeong	720330471419150338	2016-04-13T19:19:02	Prosecutor Matt Segal disagrees. Says Keys was after the Tribune before he ever got involved with Anonymous (according to the record)
sarahjeong	720330275972980736	2016-04-13T19:18:15	Jay Leiderman is saying that Keys and others were swept up in the "spirit of time," and that this and other acts were merely pranks
sarahjeong	720329382322016257	2016-04-13T19:14:42	I'd say things are swinging in Keys's favor but jail time is still on table
sarahjeong	720329023235067905	2016-04-13T19:13:16	Prosecutor, in a "WTF" voice: "He gave an interview to the LA Times."
sarahjeong	720328942469513216	2016-04-13T19:12:57	Judge says she won't look at that, and is only looking at the narrow evidentiary record bc they haven't gone into who tweeted what when etc
sarahjeong	720328810332233728	2016-04-13T19:12:26	Prosecutor does not like that Keys has been tweeting and giving interviews as follows 
sarahjeong	720327968359198720	2016-04-13T19:09:05	When asked to compare to Hammond, "I haven’t seen Hammond’s PSR, and that’s why I don’t think you should engage in this exercise."
sarahjeong	720327916861521920	2016-04-13T19:08:53	Court wants to compare to sentencing in the other Anonymous cases. Prosecutor is pisssssssed.
sarahjeong	720325440187928576	2016-04-13T18:59:02	SaraMorrison not exactly what they want but it's leaning towards them rather than the prosecution
sarahjeong	720325327747059712	2016-04-13T18:58:35	SaraMorrison this is really good
sarahjeong	720325124595945474	2016-04-13T18:57:47	Arguments now begin on other factors.
sarahjeong	720325065514962944	2016-04-13T18:57:33	(This isn't her sentence, this is the range she has determined is appropriate according to the sentencing guidelines.)
sarahjeong	720324944584781825	2016-04-13T18:57:04	Judge's guideline calculations: 37-46 months
sarahjeong	720324373651927041	2016-04-13T18:54:48	This ruling clearly not expected by prosecution, who only sought to prove loss sufficient to clear the $5k CFAA felony threshold
sarahjeong	720324206534131712	2016-04-13T18:54:08	Presentencing report said about $249k. Prosecution showed about $13k loss to the Tribune Company at trial.
sarahjeong	720324050212364288	2016-04-13T18:53:31	Judge has found that actual loss for sentencing purposes is what was shown at trial. This is huge.
sarahjeong	720323939596001282	2016-04-13T18:53:04	Judge is running through objections to PSR, coming up on a sentencing range under the guidelines soon.

sarahjeong	709816830710382592	2016-03-15T19:01:34	Thing is, high state unemployment also correlates with a large minority population
sarahjeong	709816381307555840	2016-03-15T18:59:47	Clinton usually wins states that have &gt;4% unemployment. Sanders wins most states with &lt;4% unemployment

sarahjeong	709804044613582848	2016-03-15T18:10:46	IEthics NSQE yep. The additional tricky thing is that when it's a gap-filling statute the argument cuts both ways.
sarahjeong	709803337034543104	2016-03-15T18:07:57	NSQE but the age isn't irrelevant to that calculus. not the primary factor to weigh, but not irrelevant.

sarahjeong	709796275701452801	2016-03-15T17:39:54	Snowden only Slytherins pronounce doge with a hard g. This is canon
sarahjeong	709795323699339264	2016-03-15T17:36:07	NSQE tho that assumes that a base level of judicial restraint is appropriate re: all writs act—but i don't think it's a crazy assumption
sarahjeong	709795000054231040	2016-03-15T17:34:50	NSQE doesn't it, though? it's so old that it can't have been foreseeable to be used as a "stopgap" in this particular instance.
sarahjeong	709794537250496512	2016-03-15T17:32:59	Snowden why are you against transparency into how you pronounce doge

sarahjeong	709461924145197056	2016-03-14T19:31:18	Ugarles i think it's more indicative of contempt for gawker, which is a bad sign for damages

sarahjeong	708059603112595456	2016-03-10T22:38:59	Was it bad form for DOJ not to credit OrinKerr's tweet?

sarahjeong	708049343735926784	2016-03-10T21:58:13	Also how funny is it that the All Writs Act of 1789 is NOT OUTDATED AND MATTERS ABSOLUTELY but CALEA (1994) is, and doesn't matter
sarahjeong	708048684290695168	2016-03-10T21:55:35	(And to be fair NotAllCongress but come on that hearing was pretty brutal)

sarahjeong	708048438189920256	2016-03-10T21:54:37	IDK how this is going to work out but it's really bizarre to see DOJ consistently argue that Congressional inaction re: CALEA means nothing—
sarahjeong	708048200238641152	2016-03-10T21:53:40	Remarkable that DOJ argues Apple is spitting on "democratically elected branches of govt" when Congress recently ripped Comey a new one

sarahjeong	707662660725116928	2016-03-09T20:21:40	Right now, on one search, I have had to skip over dozens of women with good job descriptions because their profiles are private.
sarahjeong	707662326153908224	2016-03-09T20:20:20	I help hire for very good, well-paying companies. I will overlook hundreds of talented women because they're prioritizing their own safety.
sarahjeong	707661697834569728	2016-03-09T20:17:51	Harassment isn't only something done actively. It's a history of violence towards women, that keeps us from taking what we have earned.
sarahjeong	707661268438507520	2016-03-09T20:16:08	A thing you may not know excludes women from high-profile jobs is that they often lock their LinkedIn accts or hide their email addresses.

sarahjeong	707651411270619140	2016-03-09T19:36:58	sarahjeong I wish they would take *that* from Facebook before they took algo timelines.
sarahjeong	707651254852263936	2016-03-09T19:36:21	And aside from harassment, there's many basic things—like being able to turn off notifications for a popular tweet—that would help the UX
sarahjeong	707651027986591745	2016-03-09T19:35:27	More options would help a lot of this. What if I could turn off replies to a RT? What if I could hide who I follow?  
sarahjeong	707650014600949766	2016-03-09T19:31:25	I really wish twitter allowed for granular privacy, so we could decide if we want a particular tweet to be RT-able. 
sarahjeong	707650303122739200	2016-03-09T19:32:34	When users can't employ the most basic functions of Twitter out of fear, there's probably a problem.
sarahjeong	707650104132395008	2016-03-09T19:31:46	I know a woman who don't follow anyone on Twitter because the people she follows will get harassed.
sarahjeong	707650011798982656	2016-03-09T19:31:24	Hell, when I was getting targeted, I went through a period of not faving anyone, because those people would get targeted.
sarahjeong	707649851845050368	2016-03-09T19:30:46	I often feel that way, and when the topic is "controversial" I think twice about amplifying the voices of non-public figures
sarahjeong	707649746496655360	2016-03-09T19:30:21	Been noticing an uptick in white male friends expressing to me reservations about retweeting women, because of resulting harassment

sarahjeong	706992844808933376	2016-03-08T00:00:04	I'm going to add that this entire case is only possible because Jun Feng (AKA "Kevin") claims he forgot the passcode to his iPhone.

sarahjeong	706991864033849344	2016-03-07T23:56:10	Yeah, not an ideal test case for either Orenstein *or* DOJ. Frankly a freak occurrence that it ended up in front of Orenstein at all.

sarahjeong	706991138159263745	2016-03-07T23:53:17	iPhone in the New York case is pre-iOS 8. Not like the San Bernardino phone. There's a set procedure for govt requests for these phones.
sarahjeong	706986206614003712	2016-03-07T23:33:41	Important to note: the burden for Apple to comply in San Bernardino is MUCH greater than in the New York case.
