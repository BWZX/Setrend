JackDamn	688904042420948992	2016-01-18T02:01:37	farcry360 Those are my quick thoughts. Hope some of that helped. Cheers!  =^.^=
JackDamn	688903936527319040	2016-01-18T02:01:12	farcry360 But I do honor the primary trend (200-SMA), so any trade/investment against that trend is consider speculative &amp; size is reduced.
JackDamn	688903636961738752	2016-01-18T02:00:00	farcry360 The reason I don't get too wrapped up in "Bull/Bear" labels is that I find I miss opportunities either way if I'm broadly bias.
JackDamn	688903091106623489	2016-01-18T01:57:50	farcry360 As for Small Caps: clear downtrend. Bear market? Well, at the very least under the 200-SMA. So, caution. 
JackDamn	688902670841597953	2016-01-18T01:56:10	farcry360 What's the trend today? Sideways for Lg Caps, though we now have a lower high &amp; lower low. 
JackDamn	688901856391647232	2016-01-18T01:52:56	farcry360 If the market is in an uptrend, I press my longs ("higher highs, higher lows"). Downtrends, I press my shorts or stand aside.
JackDamn	688901607245807616	2016-01-18T01:51:56	farcry360 But honestly... I don't get too wrapped in in the "Bull/Bear" market labels.
JackDamn	688901422369247232	2016-01-18T01:51:12	farcry360 So my approach is to first decided what a bear market means to me and then go from there.
JackDamn	688900896990740480	2016-01-18T01:49:07	farcry360 Corrections being -10% to -15% or so. I pretty much fall into the "anything below a 200-day MA" should be traded with caution.
JackDamn	688900400351543296	2016-01-18T01:47:09	farcry360 in a correction.
JackDamn	688900370978832384	2016-01-18T01:47:02	farcry360 If you use the standard "-20% from all time highs" then you might say Small Caps are in a bear (-22%), but everything else is
JackDamn	688900109971533824	2016-01-18T01:46:00	farcry360 in a bear market, or at the very lease, a corrective downtrend.
JackDamn	688899998340100097	2016-01-18T01:45:33	farcry360 For example, if you use a long term moving average such as the 100, 150, or 200 day as a guide, then one might say we are
JackDamn	688899718634602496	2016-01-18T01:44:26	farcry360 As far as whether this is a bear market I suppose it would depend on how you measure bull/bear markets.
