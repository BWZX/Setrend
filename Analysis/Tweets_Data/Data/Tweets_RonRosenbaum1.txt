RonRosenbaum1	693617843447922688	2016-01-31T02:12:35	KStreetHipster And that's the point of gerrymandering to insulate GOP seats from a national tide.
RonRosenbaum1	693617284758241280	2016-01-31T02:10:22	KStreetHipster your choice.Of course you'd have to assume that increased turnout would always favor Dems, not a necessity.

RonRosenbaum1	693615139979935744	2016-01-31T02:01:50	KStreetHipster that's what I thought. No data to back up the claim.
RonRosenbaum1	693614926498304004	2016-01-31T02:00:59	KStreetHipster How many districts would how much turnout have changed in '10, '14. What's your data source?

RonRosenbaum1	693134715692421120	2016-01-29T18:12:48	Tulletilsynet if you study evil doers they almost all think what they're doing is  best for all.
RonRosenbaum1	693133790529638401	2016-01-29T18:09:08	Tulletilsynet felixgilman clnichols6 HMittelmark They had racist ideas they thought were for the benefit of all, "inferiors i" included.
RonRosenbaum1	693132505063514113	2016-01-29T18:04:01	Tulletilsynet felixgilman clnichols6 HMittelmark But diff ppl have radically diff notions of what's just. Some thought segregation was.
RonRosenbaum1	693131951281192960	2016-01-29T18:01:49	felixgilman clnichols6 HMittelmark Tulletilsynet it's about what you THINK is just. Many "justices' then. thus none.
RonRosenbaum1	693127907594653696	2016-01-29T17:45:45	2/ Tulletilsynet felixgilman  That's my pointit's nt infallible and not perverse to question  whether it-or any 1 rule-- is the One.
RonRosenbaum1	693127599921430528	2016-01-29T17:44:32	1/Tulletilsynet felixgilman Everybody cites it as the one true sentiment shared by all religions as standard of conduct.
RonRosenbaum1	693126236239978497	2016-01-29T17:39:07	Tulletilsynet felixgilman Exacty.
RonRosenbaum1	693124877604294656	2016-01-29T17:33:43	Tulletilsynet felixgilman So the idiot Oregon 'takeover' ppl who "know they've been wronged" are therefore right?
RonRosenbaum1	693124167940587521	2016-01-29T17:30:53	felixgilman Tulletilsynet Sure, for children. That's all I'm saying. It's not an infallible guide for adults. There are none.
RonRosenbaum1	693122790841540608	2016-01-29T17:25:25	Tulletilsynet Exactly, so it's a limite self protect, selfish thing, no especially wonderful "golden" rule--is all I'm saying.
RonRosenbaum1	693122443586727936	2016-01-29T17:24:02	felixgilman Tulletilsynet Good, then we agree: stop making the Golden rule a golden calf.
RonRosenbaum1	693122203978743809	2016-01-29T17:23:05	felixgilman Tulletilsynet that's not an argument for its primacy as measurement of behavior.
RonRosenbaum1	693122001519689728	2016-01-29T17:22:17	felixgilman Tulletilsynet but what if you don't deserve "Golden". treatment. it just encourages selfishness.
RonRosenbaum1	693121222742274048	2016-01-29T17:19:11	Tulletilsynet not a 'beef==an observation about the way people overstate the easiness of ethical choice by wroshipping this so called Rule
RonRosenbaum1	693120172425633792	2016-01-29T17:15:01	felixgilman Tulletilsynet I'm not sure you always can. That's why such purprted rules are overstate/overrated. make it seem too easy.
RonRosenbaum1	693119866199527424	2016-01-29T17:13:48	felixgilman Tulletilsynet So whatever makes you feel better is therefor  "right"?
RonRosenbaum1	693119661400027138	2016-01-29T17:12:59	felixgilman Tulletilsynet Why bring others behaivor into it at all. A more Golden R ule would be do unto others the right thing"
RonRosenbaum1	693119181143801856	2016-01-29T17:11:04	felixgilman Tulletilsynet But it makes willing reciprocity the &lt;measure&gt; of goodness rather than the intrinsic rightness.
RonRosenbaum1	693118343482621952	2016-01-29T17:07:45	Tulletilsynet Doesn't present itself as "subjective rule of thumb".rather as "Golden Rule" highest order of morality,heart of all religions
RonRosenbaum1	693117937079717888	2016-01-29T17:06:08	Tulletilsynet No seeing much of a difference. Goodness judged by how good people are to you, not for its intrinsic merit.
RonRosenbaum1	693109140252663808	2016-01-29T16:31:11	Doesn't anyone care the "Golden Rule' is crude selfishness--shouldn't you do the right thing for its own sake not for personal payback?
RonRosenbaum1	693105253424693249	2016-01-29T16:15:44	Good q.. Drefyss makes the case that Madoff was a "sociopath"&amp;thus didn't &lt;feel&gt; way we wld
