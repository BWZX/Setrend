RosamundUrwin	695545668035878912	2016-02-05T09:53:04	IsabelHardman Yes, exactly. I also think there's a default habit of blaming the elderly - bed-blocking mostly meaning elderly patients
RosamundUrwin	695545422002184192	2016-02-05T09:52:05	IsabelHardman Technically they're "bed-blocking", but even with a well-functioning care system, it would take time to assess their needs
RosamundUrwin	695545205328576512	2016-02-05T09:51:14	IsabelHardman Sometimes yes. But my Mum, a retired geriatrician, now sits on a continuing care panel. These are people with v complex needs
