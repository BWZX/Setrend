SMTuffy	723556427621634048	2016-04-22T16:57:50	shiv5468 totally, UCITS brand is something that only exits at an institutional level
SMTuffy	723534818538053632	2016-04-22T15:31:58	Further evidence of the shift in mood by EU policymakers, focus now on growth not restrictions  
SMTuffy	723532634396196864	2016-04-22T15:23:17	"The SEC doesn't care so much about giving Cohen a win. It just wants to keep him where it can see him." 
SMTuffy	723512881162141696	2016-04-22T14:04:47	&gt;&gt; So, overall,  the loss of a "UCITS designation" probably only directly impacts a smaller subset of UK asset management |
SMTuffy	723512591805460480	2016-04-22T14:03:38	&gt;&gt; The funds would still be UCITS, because it's linked to the domicile of the fund and not the manager. &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	723512148517892096	2016-04-22T14:01:53	&gt;&gt; However, in reality, most UK managers are selling Ire/Lux UCITS funds into Europe. Here, there's not much of an impact &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	723511865645649920	2016-04-22T14:00:45	&gt;&gt; A go it alone model, means that there would be an issue for UK domiciled funds  (formerly UCITS) sold into the EU &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	723511587869462528	2016-04-22T13:59:39	&gt;&gt; in this case it would really matter what post Brexit UK looks like.  A Norwegian model means not real change. &gt;&gt;

SMTuffy	723511034137464832	2016-04-22T13:57:27	&gt;&gt; In theory these funds would lose their UCITS label &amp; become alternatives funds, governed by AIFMD. This is b/c EU fund regs are binary &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	723510434226159616	2016-04-22T13:55:04	&gt;&gt; for UK managers selling UK domiciled UCITS funds into Europe, there could be a problem post Brexit &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	723509797635674113	2016-04-22T13:52:32	&gt;&gt; Because, in reality, UK investors are probably unaware that there is a UCITS brand in the first place &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	723509475878031360	2016-04-22T13:51:15	&gt;&gt; So, for a UK manager selling a UK domiciled UCITS fund to UK investors, there is probably little impact of losing the "UCITS brand" &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	723509109077741568	2016-04-22T13:49:48	Not sure this is entirely true, there's more nuance at play here. (Tweetstorm Warning) &gt;&gt;

SMTuffy	723080056067776512	2016-04-21T09:24:54	Sorry, don't know where that tweetstorm came from. Going to go walk it off
SMTuffy	723079887930703872	2016-04-21T09:24:14	&gt;&gt; So, in sum, enough with "Irish and Lux funds don't pay tax. So something dodgy must be happening" line. It's just a nonsense
SMTuffy	723079500452507648	2016-04-21T09:22:41	&gt;&gt; which is left to the investors home country because, as we know, the EU is not a federalized tax system. &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	723079240598589440	2016-04-21T09:21:39	&gt;&gt; the taxation of Irish/Lux funds is not dissimilar to the taxation of US mutual funds.  What is different is the taxation of investors &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	723078958082850816	2016-04-21T09:20:32	&gt;&gt; Usually based on people using the lens of US mutual funds and not getting the idea of the EU single market &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	723078442120548352	2016-04-21T09:18:29	&gt;&gt; Most complaints about "Irish/Lux funds" not paying taxes are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how UCITS funds work &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	723078064612204544	2016-04-21T09:16:59	&gt;&gt; I mean, why should they collect rents from the funds, when the investors are based in other countries?  &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	723077775335251968	2016-04-21T09:15:50	&gt;&gt; That is left to the home country of the Investor. The suggestion that Ireland/Lux not taxing the investors is bad is so wrongheaded &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	723077500105068544	2016-04-21T09:14:44	&gt;&gt; So, for example, on US dividends they pay 30% withholding tax to the US of A.  What isn't taxed is income earned by investors &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	723077090032103425	2016-04-21T09:13:07	To be clear Irish &amp; Lux UCITS fund, where applicable, pay tax on income they earn from their investments. &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	723073139551416320	2016-04-21T08:57:25	This is all part of Hong Kong's ambition to become a global fund domicile, like Ireland or Lux. With the trump card being access to china

SMTuffy	719295133821353985	2016-04-10T22:44:58	Okay, so the HMRC considers Irish funds "Offshore" but that's because tax law is generally binary in its world view &gt;&gt;

SMTuffy	719078761778573313	2016-04-10T08:25:11	&gt;&gt; So, bottom line, just throwing around the term 'offshore trust' to deliberately make a thing sound sketchy, isn't helpful or accurate |
SMTuffy	719078289529315328	2016-04-10T08:23:18	&gt;&gt; In fact, the Cayman Unit Trust is still incredibly popular for selling funds into Japan &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	719077990609653760	2016-04-10T08:22:07	&gt;&gt; so now, in Ireland and the UK, Unit Trusts are largely a legacy of a different time but there is nothing inherently dodgy about them &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	719077538937643008	2016-04-10T08:20:19	&gt;&gt; starting inmid-90's corporate fund structures became more popular for crossborder funds, which coincided withe rise of Lux/Ireland &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	719077094777597952	2016-04-10T08:18:33	&gt;&gt;  This differs from the US, where the '40 act made corporate fund structure (RICs) the most common type of structure &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	719076275168681985	2016-04-10T08:15:18	&gt;&gt; In fact, until the OEIC was introduced in 1997, the Unit Trust was the really the only fund structure available in the UK &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	719075852349259776	2016-04-10T08:13:37	&gt;&gt; however, in reality, the Blairmore fund was a 'Unit Trust' which is a very common open-end fund structure, especially in the UK &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	719075000330936321	2016-04-10T08:10:14	&gt;&gt; a lot of the press coverage keeps throwing around the word 'Trust' like there's something inherently nefarious about it &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	719074688241115136	2016-04-10T08:09:00	I'm pretty sure I don't want to go down this rabbit hole again but I've got one more thread I want to pull on.  So bear with me &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	719073700759347200	2016-04-10T08:05:04	&gt;&gt; The phrase 'did not pay British taxes on profits' is a bit misleading b/c DC would have paid cap gains, if there happened to be any
SMTuffy	719073093336043520	2016-04-10T08:02:39	Obviously, the biggest error is the 'Panama based trust' bit as, we all know, the fund moved to Ireland. &gt;&gt;

SMTuffy	718827234442784768	2016-04-09T15:45:42	KatieMorley_ Pete_Spence there's grey area between evasion/avoidance but, think we can all agree, that paying tax qualifies as neither
SMTuffy	718796432208236544	2016-04-09T13:43:18	So, basically, one set of policies is creating anxiety for another set of policymakers ... which is fun
SMTuffy	718796015785111552	2016-04-09T13:41:39	Of course, the rub is that other policymakers are pushing cheap passive funds as a solution to the retirement/savings issue
SMTuffy	718795323347451904	2016-04-09T13:38:54	Again, it's this sort of thing that really unnerves the macro-prudential regulators and is why they're looking at risk of asset management

SMTuffy	718737988046471169	2016-04-09T09:51:04	&gt;&gt; Okay, that's enough for now. After all, it's Saturday morning for goodness sake
SMTuffy	718737757636587520	2016-04-09T09:50:09	&gt;&gt; So, overall, it's hard to see where the lighter finreg burden in going to come from. I mean, maybe, banker pay but that's about it &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	718737426064240641	2016-04-09T09:48:50	&gt;&gt; on the banking side, the UK has been much tougher on the sector than the EU &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	718736605649965056	2016-04-09T09:45:34	&gt;&gt; For example: the ban on inducements for fund sales, the unbundling of sales research are UK initiatives that were forced in EU regs &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	718736097094844417	2016-04-09T09:43:33	&gt;&gt; That, post GFC, the UK has been, by and large, much tougher on FinReg than the EU. &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	718735683289014272	2016-04-09T09:41:55	&gt;&gt; However, the biggest issue with the fallacy of the post Brexit reduced finreg burden is that it overlooks the very obvious fact that &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	718735177275588608	2016-04-09T09:39:54	&gt;&gt; again, without the benefit of being above to influence the drafting of the regs &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	718734980873134080	2016-04-09T09:39:07	&gt;&gt; Second, if UK ends up completely out of EU/EEA, then still needs to implement equivalent regs to get access to EU (like the Swiss) &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	718734342894284800	2016-04-09T09:36:35	&gt;&gt; first, if UK ends up in the 'Norwegian model' then it will have to implement all EU regs (w/o benefit of helping drafts the regs, btw) &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	718733846708109312	2016-04-09T09:34:37	&gt;&gt; For a few of reasons, idea that the UK would have a lighter FinReg burden post Brexit holds no water &gt;&gt;

SMTuffy	700641536090836992	2016-02-19T11:22:14	&gt;&gt; However, a member state can pull out of enhanced cooperation at any time before the proposals are finalized &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	700640916965462016	2016-02-19T11:19:46	&gt;&gt; last week EU Council Legal Service issued its opinion that once a reg is passed a member stat can't pull out of enhanced cooperation  &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	700640369147379716	2016-02-19T11:17:35	&gt;&gt; Which necessitated getting opinion of the EU Council Legal Service on if it was possible to back out of enhanced cooperation &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	700639902086463489	2016-02-19T11:15:44	&gt;&gt; This came up during the EU Council (Ecofin) meeting of 8 December 2015, in relation to the fraying coalition around the FTT  &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	700639162362306560	2016-02-19T11:12:48	Here's a fun EU fact: there's legal ambiguity as to whether or not a Member State can withdraw from an authorised enhanced cooperation &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	700627225842839552	2016-02-19T10:25:22	FCA‚Äôs due diligence thematic review has landed. All 9 pages of it 
SMTuffy	700622374769569792	2016-02-19T10:06:05	ajtfreeman In general, I think the brexit and &amp; asset management coverage has been pretty poor
SMTuffy	700614472394784768	2016-02-19T09:34:41	&gt;&gt; With that, I'm going to grab a second coffee ... -Fin-
SMTuffy	700614109549748225	2016-02-19T09:33:15	&gt;&gt; They would basically be no different than a NY manager that has Irish/Lux UCITS that are sold across the EU, which, again, is common &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	700613835707666432	2016-02-19T09:32:09	&gt;&gt; If UK managers already have Lux/Irish UCITS, then the Brexit would not have a material impact on their operation &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	700613653427576833	2016-02-19T09:31:26	&gt;&gt; So, UK managers exporting UK funds would likely have to set up a Lux/Irish UCITS to continue selling funds into the EU &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	700613446283481088	2016-02-19T09:30:37	&gt;&gt; This is b/c EU policy is pretty binary in that there's   1) UCITS 2) Alternative Funds (everything that's not a UCITS)  &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	700613040782315520	2016-02-19T09:29:00	&gt;&gt; in the event of a Brexit, the UK UCITS would essentially become an "alternative fund"  in the eyes of the EU and governed by AIFMD &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	700612738893139968	2016-02-19T09:27:48	&gt;&gt; The big brexit issue for UK managers is if they have UK UCITS that are sold into the EU. In this case, there's a real problem &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	700612353902120960	2016-02-19T09:26:16	&gt;&gt; The vast majority of funds in the two biggest UCITS domiciles Lux &amp; Ireland are managed elsewhere both in and out of the EU &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	700611772647133184	2016-02-19T09:23:57	&gt;&gt; There is no way EU regulators would disallow management of UCITS to be done in a country other than the fund domicile &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	700611477812727808	2016-02-19T09:22:47	&gt;&gt; At most a UCITS may need a local Management Company but in no way is that "skirting the rules" &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	700610637475479552	2016-02-19T09:19:27	&gt;&gt; First, UCITS funds can be managed by notn-EEA members as lots of US managers can attest &gt;&gt;
SMTuffy	700610264400588800	2016-02-19T09:17:58	Oh my, there is so much wrong in these paragraphs on Brexit &amp; UCITS   &gt;&gt;
