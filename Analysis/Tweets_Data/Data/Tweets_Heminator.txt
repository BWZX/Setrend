Heminator	726163902988357633	2016-04-29T21:39:00	ClemVegas37 I never said that. Where are you getting this?
Heminator	726163587928989697	2016-04-29T21:37:45	ClemVegas37 Well, if Sean Hannity says Sean Hannity's been fair... please. 
Heminator	726163103872770048	2016-04-29T21:35:50	ClemVegas37 The total amount of airtime has been insane. Hannity has interviewed at Trump at his rallies as the warm-up act.

Heminator	726161949487067136	2016-04-29T21:31:14	ClemVegas37 I have said nothing about Rush. Hannity is sellout to Trump and it's obvious.
Heminator	726161804565454848	2016-04-29T21:30:40	ClemVegas37 McCain actually has track record of conservative votes, even if he's not as conservative as I would like. Same w/ Romney.
Heminator	726160926043336704	2016-04-29T21:27:10	ClemVegas37 Saying they were both liberals to the same extent as Trump is *delusional.*

Heminator	696178119116464128	2016-02-07T03:46:12	We raised 3X as much money during this debate as we have during any previous debate.
Heminator	696179392309886976	2016-02-07T03:51:16	Some truth in this.  
Heminator	696178760945700864	2016-02-07T03:48:45	Here's the GovChristie - marcorubio exchange everyone is talking about  GOPDebate 
Heminator	696178664388464640	2016-02-07T03:48:22	The fact that the Superbowl is tomorrow, and good debate performances will get limited play, also probably means governors are out soon.
Heminator	696177142166593537	2016-02-07T03:42:19	At the end of the debate, Rubio is outdoing everyone else on search. Question is what happens tomorrow when the repetition goes on news loop
Heminator	696177008565293058	2016-02-07T03:41:47	Christie's 'You've gotten to know my heart' is New Jersey speak for 'Don't f--k me New Hampshire!'
Heminator	696176684282712064	2016-02-07T03:40:30	Debaters, ranked: 1. Christie (but at 5% not sure it helps much) 2. Jeb  3. Tie Cruz/Rubio 4. Tie Kasich/Trump 5. Who?
Heminator	696176082156916736	2016-02-07T03:38:06	Trump's got a bris to go to! Mazel tov, Ivanka and Jared Kushner!
Heminator	696175598733959168	2016-02-07T03:36:11	Wow. 
Heminator	696174829326602240	2016-02-07T03:33:08	Trump's all about loyalty. 
Heminator	696174398546382848	2016-02-07T03:31:25	HINT: Colorado is a swing state.
Heminator	696174086230114304	2016-02-07T03:30:11	It's not over yet, but I'm calling this debate for mkhammer.
Heminator	696173923193397249	2016-02-07T03:29:32	Rubio has done well enough as time goes on in this debate, I think he's mitigated (some of) the earlier poor responses.
Heminator	696173360686964736	2016-02-07T03:27:18	Very strong...VERY strong...answer from Rubio on abortion. Wow. GOPDebate
Heminator	696172981417078784	2016-02-07T03:25:47	Hey, realDonaldTrump stole $6 million from vets by debating tonight!!
Heminator	696173503653892096	2016-02-07T03:27:52	Not a New Hampshire play, but great South Carolina play on abortion by Rubio.
Heminator	696173255590195200	2016-02-07T03:26:53	sladesr They did IIRC but it was really more about kids, I'd say.
Heminator	696172618680938497	2016-02-07T03:24:21	Who's gonna write the Enders Game for women?  
Heminator	696171396653666304	2016-02-07T03:19:29	A nation that decides to send its mothers and daughters to war without their consent better have a good reason for it beyond feminism.
Heminator	696172299083362305	2016-02-07T03:23:05	Now would be a good time to highlight Sanders' terrible job with VA oversight in Congress.
Heminator	696171877937471488	2016-02-07T03:21:24	If he's a Democrat... 
Heminator	696171686824144896	2016-02-07T03:20:39	Heminator Not me.
Heminator	696171606536622080	2016-02-07T03:20:19	Didn't someone -- JVLast? -- report that VA guy is not voting for Bush?
Heminator	696170700663459840	2016-02-07T03:16:43	Is no one going to say that drafting women to fight is horrifying?
Heminator	696170384601710592	2016-02-07T03:15:28	Fact checkers are going to run wild criticizing Rubio's entirely true statements about military size. 
Heminator	696169742764118016	2016-02-07T03:12:55	Marco is sweating.
Heminator	696169285421367296	2016-02-07T03:11:06	Reminder: Ebola outbreak was much more dangerous than CDC/feds told us!

Heminator	696168000865480704	2016-02-07T03:06:00	Another good Trump answer on law enforcement.
Heminator	696165903503785984	2016-02-07T02:57:40	Somewhere a liberal journalist is thinking of tweeting a 'Benghazi' acrostic joke, and finally deciding it's a bad idea.
Heminator	696165435083874304	2016-02-07T02:55:48	First half of debate was disaster. Everyone much better in second half.
Heminator	696164777354256384	2016-02-07T02:53:11	Christie is very good at looking straight into a camera. And pro-life spin works here.
Heminator	696164491273363456	2016-02-07T02:52:03	Heminator charlescwcooke apples and oranges--you can't compare Reagan and Obama on exec orders 
Heminator	696164289820778496	2016-02-07T02:51:15	Strangely human and touching response from Cruz.
Heminator	696164048988213248	2016-02-07T02:50:18	Two very different kinds of addiction.  
Heminator	696163802853736448	2016-02-07T02:49:19	New Hampshire : Heroin :: Iowa : Ethanol
Heminator	696163607516590080	2016-02-07T02:48:32	It's a qualitative issue; not necessarily a quantitative one. Obama's use of executive objectively worse. 
Heminator	696162918279282688	2016-02-07T02:45:48	Stupid point. Type of exec action matters. Obama's broad use of enforcement discretion is unprecedented. 
Heminator	696162622278930432	2016-02-07T02:44:37	Very good point - from a man who knows. 
Heminator	696162334901956608	2016-02-07T02:43:29	Rubio seems to have gotten his mojo back after the break -- several strong answers on foreign policy/national security. abcdebate
Heminator	696162634979127296	2016-02-07T02:44:40	ENDORSED 
Heminator	696162516871749633	2016-02-07T02:44:12	Actually, a decent response from Trump on dealmaking.
Heminator	696161312196448256	2016-02-07T02:39:25	"I'd bring back a hell of a lot worse than water-boarding" if you won't take my offer on your property I want to make into a casino...
Heminator	696161309780484096	2016-02-07T02:39:24	Yes. 
Heminator	696161297453350914	2016-02-07T02:39:22	Trump “I would bring back waterboarding, and I would bring back a hell of a lot more than waterboarding”. Iron maiden, trial by fire FTW.
Heminator	696161664316497920	2016-02-07T02:40:49	Foreign policy helping Rubio find his legs again,
Heminator	696160877230198787	2016-02-07T02:37:41	JSwiftTWS GPollowitz TAKE IT BACK
Heminator	696160359468535810	2016-02-07T02:35:38	He's alive!
Heminator	696159693119434752	2016-02-07T02:32:59	Uh, burning oil wells are a nightmare to put out. Hasn't Trump seen John Wayne's 'Hellfighters'?
Heminator	696159365028519937	2016-02-07T02:31:41	He's outlining a strategy, not a list of tactics. That's the difference.  
Heminator	696159150775132162	2016-02-07T02:30:50	Even if you don't agree with his hawkishness, no one on stage can touch Rubio's command of foreign policy.
Heminator	696158946265006080	2016-02-07T02:30:01	GAH 
Heminator	696158235330392066	2016-02-07T02:27:11	Cruz: "When I say saturation carpet bombing, that's not indiscriminate." ISIS
Heminator	696158807647453184	2016-02-07T02:29:28	How hard would it have been for Cruz to say he misspoke when he said "carpet bombing"?  
Heminator	696158470656147456	2016-02-07T02:28:08	Shorter Cruz: "Jacksonians! Abandon the false prophet Trump and rally to me! We shall warm ourselves off the glowing sands of our enemies!"
Heminator	696158583243857921	2016-02-07T02:28:34	Please tell me this debate ends at 10.
Heminator	696158225071144961	2016-02-07T02:27:09	What's the record for the length of time on a debate stage without speaking? Does Carson own it yet?
Heminator	696157767883583489	2016-02-07T02:25:20	By a country mile. Christie too. Kasich is doing fine, but I’ve already forgotten everything he said. 
Heminator	696157872992841728	2016-02-07T02:25:45	Gotta hand it to Christie. This is a ballsy answer on tax increases.
Heminator	696157625709232129	2016-02-07T02:24:46	This is Jeb's best debate.
Heminator	696156261784690692	2016-02-07T02:19:21	Top questions on Google right now:  1) What is eminent domain? 2) What time is the Super Bowl?  3) Where is my tax refund? GOPDebate
Heminator	696154415624011776	2016-02-07T02:12:01	Another reason to oppose it. 
Heminator	696156700454342656	2016-02-07T02:21:06	Christie is effectively attacking Rubio. But now invites attacks on his own record, With Bridgegate et al. that could end poorly for him.
Heminator	696156148907413504	2016-02-07T02:18:54	Heminator  loved Rubio's "the economy isn't a zero sum game" answer on conservatism
Heminator	696155801581277185	2016-02-07T02:17:31	Can we get a second doctor on stage to check Carson's vitals?
Heminator	696155639769239552	2016-02-07T02:16:53	Ok, Rubio is alive after all.
Heminator	696155275787681792	2016-02-07T02:15:26	Pains me to say this, but that was a great answer on conservatism by Kasich.
Heminator	696155058950377472	2016-02-07T02:14:34	ErnosRebellion On eminent domain? What?
Heminator	696154955481100288	2016-02-07T02:14:09	Trump is is jumping the shark, and Rubio is having a bad night. So NH primary looking REALLY unpredictable right now.
Heminator	696153263301758976	2016-02-07T02:07:26	Read Reason's damonroot on Donald Trump and eminent domain (now with correct Twitter handle!) 
Heminator	696153259749191681	2016-02-07T02:07:25	Yeah, highway hellscapes are definitely better than tight-knit minority neighborhoods with affordable housing. 
Heminator	696153051460210688	2016-02-07T02:06:36	You talkin' to me? GOPDebate 
Heminator	696153307916607488	2016-02-07T02:07:37	Trump: You need eminent domain for hospitals. Jeb: Yeah, but you used it to try and steal an old lady's house to build a limo parking lot.
Heminator	696153154099027968	2016-02-07T02:07:00	Winners of first segment: Christie, Jeb, Kasich.  Loser: Rubio.   GOPDebate
Heminator	696153576758902784	2016-02-07T02:08:41	Jeb finally doing what he was destined to do: take out Trump.
Heminator	696152952159862785	2016-02-07T02:06:12	Oh my gosh this Trump nonsense on eminent domain is a total train wreck. Getting booed repeatedly by NH debate attendees.
Heminator	696153093210312704	2016-02-07T02:06:45	"The Reason They're Not Loving Me" peaked at #17 on Casey Kasem, November 7, 1986

Heminator	696152083997683712	2016-02-07T02:02:45	Pittsburgh has more MRI machines than all of Canada. But there's no ill effects to rationing health care. 
Heminator	696151806980681728	2016-02-07T02:01:39	LOL 
Heminator	696151187700236288	2016-02-07T01:59:11	"People dying in the street will be moved to the alleys, and they will be disposed of quickly--so quickly--it will be amazing."
Heminator	696151164140834816	2016-02-07T01:59:06	That was a good answer from Trump until it he broke out his no dying in the street plan.
Heminator	696151020003553281	2016-02-07T01:58:31	Donald Trump sounds like he has spent, oh, ten minutes thinking about health care policy.
Heminator	696150457933295620	2016-02-07T01:56:17	Out of the Kasich-Bush-Christie trio, Christie looks like he could break out between now and Tuesday.
Heminator	696150269411880960	2016-02-07T01:55:32	Good way of putting it. This isn't a debate. It's a press conference with bad questions. 
Heminator	696150398239780864	2016-02-07T01:56:03	Christie is having a good night I think.

Heminator	696148248537333760	2016-02-07T01:47:30	I get it, but "knows what he is doing" is an awkward way to put it. 
Heminator	696147987903356929	2016-02-07T01:46:28	GREAT point from Jeb on hostages.
Heminator	696147648248750081	2016-02-07T01:45:07	His  Chinese bank tenants  tell Trump "we have total control of North Korea"?  Okey dokey.

Heminator	696145679358562305	2016-02-07T01:37:18	We're quite a ways into this debate, and Kasich is MIA.
Heminator	696145270120325120	2016-02-07T01:35:40	Christie is scraping bark off Rubio, but I wonder how many votes Christie gets for it.
Heminator	696144993614958593	2016-02-07T01:34:34	Christie's attack on Rubio for memorized talking points is itself a memorized talking point Christie's been using on the stump, just FYI
Heminator	696144983255031808	2016-02-07T01:34:32	This Rubio line about Obama knowing what he’s doing. . . I see what he’s getting at, but I don’t think it’s working.
Heminator	696145197147803648	2016-02-07T01:35:23	Christie should bring up Rubio's voting record if we're talking about job performance.
Heminator	696144903353585665	2016-02-07T01:34:13	Wow. Christie is really giving it to Rubio. Effectively.
Heminator	696144806066659330	2016-02-07T01:33:50	So you hug Obama? Is the easy retort on Christie.

Heminator	696140894446219264	2016-02-07T01:18:17	So, ABC led me to believe the debate began at 8. Why?
