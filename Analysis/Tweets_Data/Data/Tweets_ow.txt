ow	686278197227356160	2016-01-10T20:07:27	MartinSFP starting to feel like it
ow	686274790395527168	2016-01-10T19:53:55	If Apple would adopt USB-C on mobile honestly this wouldn't even be a big deal
ow	686274582475481088	2016-01-10T19:53:05	hannes_bhc because your car has a set software level and its Bluetooth stack never gets updated?
ow	686274461029380096	2016-01-10T19:52:36	abdophoto which is cool! But oh god I'm scared of how this is gonna go down
ow	686274379492098050	2016-01-10T19:52:17	@Macnaxito I had the backbeat. They're okay, but meh compared to high end 3.5mm stuff
ow	686274223115866112	2016-01-10T19:51:39	tapbot_paul imagine the actual accessory support...
ow	686273256215609344	2016-01-10T19:47:49	abdophoto I think audio is at a even larger scale than that. Almost every single audio device on the planet has a 3.5mm jack
ow	686273102964080640	2016-01-10T19:47:12	tapbot_paul switching to USBC would solve all these issues but that'll probably never happen
ow	686272966653427714	2016-01-10T19:46:40	I *really* don't want Bluetooth headphones either. The paring is a constant pain and just another thing to charge.
ow	686272765893017600	2016-01-10T19:45:52	abdophoto I think everyone plugs in their headphones often
ow	686272715519492096	2016-01-10T19:45:40	tapbot_paul ugh. Would laptops even have a female lightning port tho? Strange
ow	686272620895944705	2016-01-10T19:45:17	svenluijten ugh
ow	686272231148666880	2016-01-10T19:43:44	The thing I don't get about the iPhone losing headphone jack rumors is how I'll  use headphones on my MacBook if they're using lightning
