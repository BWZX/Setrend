FelicityMorse	699543577689456640	2016-02-16T10:39:20	EddieRobson AndreaMann but you know, that's because I'm nasty and brutish. Women have been far worse at taking credit for ma stuff
FelicityMorse	699543447603179520	2016-02-16T10:38:49	EddieRobson AndreaMann I think any men I work with would be too scared to do that.
FelicityMorse	699543144984137728	2016-02-16T10:37:37	AndreaMann EddieRobson probably would work back from what would work  online and then think about what to say
FelicityMorse	699543035756019712	2016-02-16T10:37:11	AndreaMann EddieRobson I am finding it interesting too. I've been thinking about what I would say in my acceptance speech
FelicityMorse	699541713384304640	2016-02-16T10:31:55	AndreaMann EddieRobson I mean, for the sake of my interactions and the disjointed flow alone. But yes, good pub convo. bad twitter one.

FelicityMorse	699538064063012864	2016-02-16T10:17:25	AndreaMann that's hurtful
FelicityMorse	699538028751155200	2016-02-16T10:17:17	AndreaMann yeah - I just wonder if you say to people "you can change stuff" then people feel they cant or stuff doesnt change
FelicityMorse	699537650047438848	2016-02-16T10:15:47	AndreaMann I think more people will see it your way, and if it has a beneficial impact then that is great.
FelicityMorse	699537453691097088	2016-02-16T10:15:00	AndreaMann enough, which is so clearly not true - maybe im wrong thinking but it seems to follow
FelicityMorse	699537351928844288	2016-02-16T10:14:36	AndreaMann I kind of also think if you say your success is down to you, then conversely, your failure is also because you didnt try hard
FelicityMorse	699537202531975168	2016-02-16T10:14:00	AndreaMann also context - I've been doing a lot of work on suicide and they tell you not to focus on outcomes - you cant control them
FelicityMorse	699537018620141568	2016-02-16T10:13:16	AndreaMann there's a fine line I suppose. I think I've heard a lot of speeches too.
FelicityMorse	699536775526686720	2016-02-16T10:12:18	AndreaMann but subtext is - this is all me - wrapped up in this is for you.
FelicityMorse	699536525281796097	2016-02-16T10:11:19	AndreaMann i think it comes across a bit "haters and losers" but like, thats just me.

FelicityMorse	699533122631831556	2016-02-16T09:57:47	AndreaMann i dont know, I just think it's a bit crass to get up and say at an awards "oh this is all me" not that I dont dream of doing it.
