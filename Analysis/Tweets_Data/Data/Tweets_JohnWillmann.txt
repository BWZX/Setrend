JohnWillmann	725009274095714304	2016-04-26T17:10:55	And PippaCrerar did you ask him why he attacked Sadiq for sharing a platform with a Muslim who was invited to Downing Street?
JohnWillmann	725008505967628288	2016-04-26T17:07:52	Dear PippaCrerar: while giving Cameron a free rant against Sadiq, did you ask whether Zac's support for Brexit would be good for London?
JohnWillmann	724693636932354052	2016-04-25T20:16:41	Great opera, great singing in ROHlucia but directors ridiculous 'amendments' mean action (eg sex on stage) doesn't match music (love song)

JohnWillmann	722051467792805888	2016-04-18T13:17:39	OMG. vote_leave actually think EU migrants contribute LITERALLY NOTHING to the UK GDP despite working. Bonkers 
JohnWillmann	722349059374202880	2016-04-19T09:00:11	Gove says Remain treating voters as children to be scared. Vote Leave treats them as morons who don't need to know what happens after Brexit
JohnWillmann	720615197887635456	2016-04-14T14:10:26	Interesting to see Lloyds Banking Group leading the way in warning against Brexit; it's not the view of chairman Lord (Norman) Blackwell

JohnWillmann	720946639452663808	2016-04-15T12:07:28	Not a good start for Vote Leave, launching its campaign with an inaccurate £350m a week figure for Britain's EU budget contribution.
JohnWillmann	721230292476915713	2016-04-16T06:54:36	Has Boris got it entirely wrong on US -surely individual states gave up almost all their sovereignty to form the federal United States?
