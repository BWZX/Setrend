yeselson	723904975970119680	2016-04-23T16:02:50	BlueBoxDave All of these issues of identity--including the definition of "white"--are vexed and deserve substantive analysis. But, in this
yeselson	723903705741942789	2016-04-23T15:57:47	BlueBoxDave But, to clarify, you think that transsexuality needs a definition, not that **other** protected classes do. Right?
yeselson	723901811443281920	2016-04-23T15:50:15	BlueBoxDave and nor, in fact, are women themselves. Seeking definitional standards sounds plausible, but we don't do it now.

yeselson	723900714209173504	2016-04-23T15:45:54	Of course. GOP helps party by suppressing franchise, which is wrong on the merits. Expanding it = normative good. 
yeselson	723898471070228480	2016-04-23T15:36:59	BlueBoxDave But that doesn't address why they are, particularly, being targeted here--what is the problem the law is meant to solve?
yeselson	723891908918042624	2016-04-23T15:10:55	BlueBoxDave Can you rebut this argument? Why target trans women when predatory men are the real issue?  
yeselson	723880571764613121	2016-04-23T14:25:52	BrooksAmes1 That's an interesting question. I suppose the answer is yes, racism is a normative value for some. Add to that partisanship.
yeselson	723613911363235840	2016-04-22T20:46:15	mtracey Right--the logic of punishment should be that, well, it's over when it's over. This regimen more like attaching scarlet "A".

yeselson	723172461328506880	2016-04-21T15:32:05	ckilpatrick JonathanCohn Yeah, that would probably work. But idea of party members selecting party nominee is intuitive. Who else should?
yeselson	723172246538219520	2016-04-21T15:31:14	ckilpatrick JonathanCohn I think membership would help expand party--that's how the left can take it over. cf, Harrington.
yeselson	723172044674719745	2016-04-21T15:30:25	JonathanCohn ckilpatrick But again--why should any of us pick the GOP nominee? We're not Republicans and never will be.
yeselson	723171885140209664	2016-04-21T15:29:47	ckilpatrick JonathanCohn that's fine, too. You're having it both ways--you're objecting to process (agree), but you don't care about it.
yeselson	723171719465164804	2016-04-21T15:29:08	ckilpatrick JonathanCohn I'm acting like people ought to check a box if they want to participate in a party's election. If they don't
yeselson	723171566922555392	2016-04-21T15:28:32	JonathanCohn ckilpatrick exclude themselves from the electoral deliberations of that party. That's seems entirely logical to me.
yeselson	723171416741318657	2016-04-21T15:27:56	JonathanCohn ckilpatrick But, if it's a transparent system and they don't choose to join party, they are making a principled decision to
yeselson	723170858483617792	2016-04-21T15:25:43	JonathanCohn ckilpatrick because you have principled objections to a party, I respect that. But then why would you have right to pick?
yeselson	723170683073622018	2016-04-21T15:25:01	JonathanCohn ckilpatrick That's better--but why should indy's pick the Dem or GOP candidate. If you can't bring yourself to check the box
yeselson	723169849472520196	2016-04-21T15:21:42	JonathanCohn ckilpatrick How does that work?
yeselson	723169786876715009	2016-04-21T15:21:27	JonathanCohn ckilpatrick Yes, right--but, again, party membership is a minimal requirement to pick party's candidates.
yeselson	723169605842149379	2016-04-21T15:20:44	JonathanCohn ckilpatrick nominee? If you want to pick the Dem or GOP nominee, what's wrong with checking a box? As long it's fair system.
yeselson	723169404817547264	2016-04-21T15:19:56	JonathanCohn ckilpatrick But for a party to have any institutional integrity, it has to have members. Again, why should you and I pick GOP
yeselson	723169254858625024	2016-04-21T15:19:20	JonathanCohn ckilpatrick And, while we are at it, caucuses are completely absurd and should be eliminated. They were joke when Obama won
yeselson	723169033739104258	2016-04-21T15:18:28	JonathanCohn ckilpatrick Yes, it's totally outrageous. My point is that a closed primary with a different system isn't.
yeselson	723168868592553987	2016-04-21T15:17:48	ckilpatrick If the system was transparent, well publicized and two weeks before election--would you still be objecting?
yeselson	723168563305963521	2016-04-21T15:16:35	JonathanCohn ckilpatrick have a voice in selecting the GOP nominee unless we wish to join the party? So issue is transparency/system.
yeselson	723168391284953089	2016-04-21T15:15:54	JonathanCohn ckilpatrick But they're not disenfranchising any more than joining the labor party is disenfranchising. Why should you or I
yeselson	723168145561686016	2016-04-21T15:14:56	Apinak ckilpatrick that's a separate issue, though. Still no reason you or I should pick the GOP nominee for president.
yeselson	723168041287053312	2016-04-21T15:14:31	ckilpatrick Yes--and I'm agreeing with you that is outrageous. But a better more transparent system would not be.
yeselson	723167256931241986	2016-04-21T15:11:24	ckilpatrick freezing membership to protect machine political interests. But logic of party members selecting party nominees is sound.
yeselson	723167058553266176	2016-04-21T15:10:37	ckilpatrick There's nothing wrong with membership parties--that how Corbyn won Labor leadership--he expanded membership. The problem is
yeselson	723166824272003073	2016-04-21T15:09:41	ckilpatrick Pretty clear, I think. You can set up a reasonable, well publicized deadline to join/switch party. NY deadline obviously not.
yeselson	723165958584463360	2016-04-21T15:06:14	Exactly--making it hard to join/switch parties is anti-democratic and outrageous. But party membership itself isn't. 
yeselson	723159094060670976	2016-04-21T14:38:58	Yes it could. 
yeselson	723158372208373760	2016-04-21T14:36:06	Yup, I agree--really for anyone interested in US politics. My review in inthesetimesmag:   
yeselson	723153474733498368	2016-04-21T14:16:38	No argument about outrageous frozen registration requirement, but usual way to take over party--cf, jeremycorbyn Labor-is to &gt; membership!

yeselson	723135289179430912	2016-04-21T13:04:22	This is absolutely right--a "freeze on party registration" is outrageous. But party membership itself is not.

yeselson	722924473331023874	2016-04-20T23:06:40	mtracey It was wrong then too. If you make it easy to join, most of those people would have voted then, too. The concept is simple:
yeselson	722923512885682178	2016-04-20T23:02:51	mtracey aren't in the party have a big role in picking the nominee. You can still vote in general election, but primaries are different.
yeselson	722923274984763393	2016-04-20T23:01:54	mtracey Right--and, again, I think that's odd. Again, make it easy to join, but how does being a party nominee mean anything if people who
yeselson	722922985091235840	2016-04-20T23:00:45	mtracey No--you're voting for a **particular party's nominee.** And you only have one vote--so you can't vote for in every party primary.
yeselson	722922192632057856	2016-04-20T22:57:36	mtracey I think membership is pretty basic for organizations, including parties. If it's not a burden, not sure what bothers you.
yeselson	722921090410938368	2016-04-20T22:53:13	mtracey If you want to get around that by checking a box, the state will never know. But even that small gesture will deter many.
yeselson	722920895623204867	2016-04-20T22:52:27	mtracey Not the issue--sure it doesn't happen much. But why have a process which doesn't eliminate that altogether when you could?
yeselson	722920700416172032	2016-04-20T22:51:40	mtracey for me to join the GOP. So, a de minimis burden--checking a box or, in UK, sending a few bucks--does weed people out.
yeselson	722920419771088897	2016-04-20T22:50:33	mtracey If the burden to joining the party, as in this case, is extreme, that's wrong. So make it easy. You couldn't make it easy enough
yeselson	722920159388635136	2016-04-20T22:49:31	mtracey Again, if it's so trivial, then it won't be a burden. And yes: should you and I vote in the GOP primary? On what normative grounds?
yeselson	722919962445086721	2016-04-20T22:48:44	chrismccreight mtracey No, of course, it's completely outrageous and wrong. Make it easy to join party.

yeselson	722919641589223425	2016-04-20T22:47:28	mtracey Right it does--but they reduced it to a few bucks and that's why Corbyn won. Not much different than US at that point.

yeselson	722919018600857600	2016-04-20T22:44:59	mtracey Why? Just set it up and publicize it so it's close to election day. What's the problem with that, as long as you facilitate it?
yeselson	722918674273677313	2016-04-20T22:43:37	mtracey Look--the system in NY is corrupt. No argument--but if you want to affect a party's decisions, you should join, esp. if it's easy.

yeselson	722918137193074688	2016-04-20T22:41:29	mtracey Logically, it's weird when you think about it--why should non-members pick a party's candidate? So just make it easy to join.

yeselson	721098117647593472	2016-04-15T22:09:23	HeerJeet sunraysunray CoreyRobin ckilpatrick karpmj I would say that he would accelerate a process well underway.
yeselson	721097995413020672	2016-04-15T22:08:54	ckilpatrick DCCyclone HeerJeet karpmj I agree with that. But I don't think voters know him the way they know Trump and Clinton.
yeselson	721096914150813696	2016-04-15T22:04:36	ckilpatrick DCCyclone HeerJeet karpmj What's the evidence for that? Clinton needs his voters, has not run tough campaign vs. him. Very
yeselson	721096394099060736	2016-04-15T22:02:32	sunraysunray HeerJeet CoreyRobin ckilpatrick karpmj valuable--she is unpopular, but he is wildly unpopular.
yeselson	721096156558790657	2016-04-15T22:01:35	sunraysunray HeerJeet CoreyRobin ckilpatrick karpmj about super well known figures like Clinton and Trump. I think about them it is
yeselson	721096029408522240	2016-04-15T22:01:05	sunraysunray HeerJeet CoreyRobin ckilpatrick karpmj Right--so the question is: is that data at all valuable besides what it tells us
yeselson	721095070271868929	2016-04-15T21:57:16	ckilpatrick DCCyclone HeerJeet karpmj I defer to the numbers. Point is that people don't enough about either of them.
yeselson	721094896485068800	2016-04-15T21:56:35	HeerJeet CoreyRobin ckilpatrick karpmj  Yes, we're calculating on the margin here. We don't know yet.
yeselson	721093952653365250	2016-04-15T21:52:50	bonecamaro ckilpatrick Maybe.
yeselson	721093779697102848	2016-04-15T21:52:09	DCCyclone HeerJeet ckilpatrick karpmj Yeah, I agree that he would be a uniquely and perhaps unprecedented weak candidate.
yeselson	721093537920630784	2016-04-15T21:51:11	ckilpatrick HeerJeet karpmj You just have to allow for that. You can't hope he will do well, but we don't know yet.
yeselson	721093429346836480	2016-04-15T21:50:45	ckilpatrick HeerJeet karpmj Right--but my central point here is that we don't really know yet how well Sanders would do with others.
yeselson	721092508252508160	2016-04-15T21:47:05	ckilpatrick HeerJeet karpmj If you look at Pew poll on the Dem voters, you see very little ideological difference between S and C voters.
yeselson	721092328031657984	2016-04-15T21:46:22	ckilpatrick HeerJeet karpmj  Who is still likely to beat Cruz or Trump. And who has gotten a couple million more votes than Sanders.
yeselson	721092099521777664	2016-04-15T21:45:28	ckilpatrick HeerJeet karpmj As Jeet said, he is both unprecedented and insufficiently known yet. So it's more complicated than you think
yeselson	721091756520030208	2016-04-15T21:44:06	ckilpatrick HeerJeet karpmj Against a candiate who could pretend to be "mainstream", his vulnerabilities would likely be exposed.
yeselson	721091560297865216	2016-04-15T21:43:19	ckilpatrick karpmj Well, I've said before here that the Sanders campaign doesn't give itself enough credit for moving Dems to left.
yeselson	721091112916660224	2016-04-15T21:41:33	HeerJeet ckilpatrick karpmj I think he might well beat Trump or Cruz. Any other R would likely have beaten him.
yeselson	721090903591530496	2016-04-15T21:40:43	ckilpatrick karpmj Well, that's what we're arguing about, aren't we? You're saying, "Yes, he is." I'm saying, "We don't know that yet."
yeselson	721090765615669249	2016-04-15T21:40:10	ckilpatrick karpmj Harrington in '80 eventually supported the pretty odious Carter.
yeselson	721090485343928320	2016-04-15T21:39:03	ckilpatrick karpmj "My way"? What is that way? As I said yesterday, it's always about the leftwing of the possible, which is why
yeselson	721090303801880577	2016-04-15T21:38:20	ckilpatrick karpmj You can't tell anything about working class voters overall by Dem primary results.
yeselson	721090178736107520	2016-04-15T21:37:50	ckilpatrick karpmj I'm happy to bet you a very expensive meal (or book or whatever you want) that Sanders would not carry white workers.
yeselson	721090011488264193	2016-04-15T21:37:10	ckilpatrick karpmj central issue here. He's not at the Clinton/Trump level of oversaturated candidate information.
yeselson	721089559124119552	2016-04-15T21:35:22	ckilpatrick karpmj I know all about that data, but I don't think that lower information voters know much about Sanders yet. That's the
yeselson	721089000786829312	2016-04-15T21:33:09	karpmj ckilpatrick Kasich's numbers have gone up, too. He beats Sanders. I don't think that demonstrates anything either.

yeselson	721087169981476864	2016-04-15T21:25:53	JAMyerson ckilpatrick That's foolish, Jesse. You merely asserted, did not make a case. I did, you chose not to rebut. That's not arguing
yeselson	721086939496116224	2016-04-15T21:24:58	JAMyerson ckilpatrick And guy--did it ever occur to you that you might be suffering from your own form of "group think"? Ever?
yeselson	721086778707419136	2016-04-15T21:24:19	JAMyerson ckilpatrick That isn't "group think", which is just a flip way to dismiss things you don't like to read. That's an *argument.*
yeselson	721086615213502464	2016-04-15T21:23:40	JAMyerson ckilpatrick **don't know anything about the guy.** They know a lot about Trump and Clinton. You have to **engage** that point.
yeselson	721086457000173572	2016-04-15T21:23:03	JAMyerson ckilpatrick I didn't say you were stupid--I do think you're sentimental. And you're not getting my central point--most voters
yeselson	721086283867635716	2016-04-15T21:22:21	JAMyerson ckilpatrick Yeah I do--he's won in a much more heterogeneous state than VT and he's not proposing trillions in tax increases.
yeselson	721086094431924224	2016-04-15T21:21:36	ckilpatrick JAMyerson even Debs (who had vulnerabilities and ran an anti-Catholic campaign in 1904). If you want to say, "worth a try"
yeselson	721085906317418497	2016-04-15T21:20:51	ckilpatrick JAMyerson are ironically replicating re Bernie the romance around Obama in '08. He's a pol, he has vulnerabilities, he's not
yeselson	721085703946375170	2016-04-15T21:20:03	ckilpatrick JAMyerson better general election candidates than Sanders and would take hits, but not the ones he's going to get. You guys
yeselson	721085552594939904	2016-04-15T21:19:27	ckilpatrick JAMyerson Dude, you're getting my "outlook." This isn't about "too liberal." Either Sherrod Brown or Warren would be much
yeselson	721085111614226432	2016-04-15T21:17:42	YeaYouRite ckilpatrick As well known as whom?
yeselson	721085021516341248	2016-04-15T21:17:20	JAMyerson ckilpatrick Ok, as I said, against either of those guys, he could win. But you're being romantic if you think that stuff won't
yeselson	721084760173494272	2016-04-15T21:16:18	ckilpatrick JAMyerson You're kidding right. This isn't about one shot stuff--it's going to be sustained and in the billions.
yeselson	721084596658552832	2016-04-15T21:15:39	ckilpatrick JAMyerson I think you're just surmising that the way McGovern's team surmised that the first year of 18 yr voters would do it.
yeselson	721084387270520834	2016-04-15T21:14:49	ckilpatrick karpmj Not yet. Not until he is nominated and his program and biography is better known to lower information voters.

yeselson	721083946986008576	2016-04-15T21:13:04	JAMyerson ckilpatrick The trillions in tax increases, which is not something most voters even know about. The sectarian left politics of
yeselson	721083770552590337	2016-04-15T21:12:22	ckilpatrick karpmj Kasich, who also looks like a winner at this point--I think he beats Bernie by a few points.
yeselson	721083683877318656	2016-04-15T21:12:01	ckilpatrick karpmj That's not what most political scientists think. I wouldn't take the polls on Cruz seriously either and certainly not
yeselson	721083463894441987	2016-04-15T21:11:09	ckilpatrick political scientists who are thinking about it agree with it too. Against Trump or Cruz, it's possible he could win, though.
yeselson	721083197203824640	2016-04-15T21:10:05	ckilpatrick logical argument-it might be wrong, but you might want to, at least, think about it a bit, rather than caricature it. Most
yeselson	721083063162269698	2016-04-15T21:09:33	ckilpatrick No, not really and it isn't "he'd get creamed." It's that he likely won't be nearly as popular in October as now. It's a pretty
yeselson	721082782525616129	2016-04-15T21:08:27	ckilpatrick everybody knows a lot about him. That is not the case with Sanders and you should, at least, interrogate your own assumptions
yeselson	721082664804093952	2016-04-15T21:07:59	ckilpatrick I think it will be a bit more rabid than that. The only candidates you can have a good idea about are Clinton and Trump because
yeselson	721082137965944832	2016-04-15T21:05:53	ckilpatrick Seriously would not take that at face value. She's a weak candidate, but they know what they would unload against Bernie.
yeselson	721076042870497284	2016-04-15T20:41:40	grudging1 mattyglesias Me too. But many others, probably a majority of the middle class most able to pay, wouldn't. Different in Europe.
yeselson	721068431160844288	2016-04-15T20:11:25	JayCostTWS That was...bad! But for historical spectacle, the 1924 convention can't be beat.
yeselson	721067022285697024	2016-04-15T20:05:49	Important point: non-wealthy voters do support the rich paying more. But *they* don't want to pay more.  
yeselson	721065456073891840	2016-04-15T19:59:36	Rather than a banal charge of hypocrisy, why don't we all support expanding the franchise, rather than limiting it?

yeselson	721003039113551872	2016-04-15T15:51:34	zackroth Very true, of course. And I also excluded FL, which is very much in the air, depending on who controls state government.

yeselson	720810102782095360	2016-04-15T03:04:55	bmaz marcatracy Yeah, it's a stupid play and it is indeed insulting to the voters.

yeselson	718558995338956801	2016-04-08T21:59:49	jneeley78 pegobry I'd also say this (between me and you--he and I blocked each other long ago). To my admittedly jaundiced eye, he sounds

yeselson	716681839864360962	2016-04-03T17:40:40	alexhazanov HeerJeet eliasisquith Right--that's important. But federalism will still keep it fairly impregnable.
yeselson	716681609206972416	2016-04-03T17:39:45	eliasisquith Ah, had never seen that. Kinda skimmed it--where does she end up? Lots of talk about "personhood." So punish "murdere", right?

yeselson	716677239908208640	2016-04-03T17:22:23	rad_mad09 My only point is not to get caught up in all of that--just do it because it's the right thing to do.
yeselson	716676692127916032	2016-04-03T17:20:13	eliasisquith lost you here--I think, fwiw, MM supports abortion rights.
yeselson	716676093558845440	2016-04-03T17:17:50	Maybe yes, maybe no--but, substantively and abstractly, a "market liberal" opposes paid leave anyway, right? 
yeselson	716675639198224385	2016-04-03T17:16:02	rad_mad09 Because tax returns are obviously a standard thing to release and he is supposedly candidate of transparency.
yeselson	716674652874096640	2016-04-03T17:12:07	rad_mad09 aravosis Because tax returns standard to release. Romney was, correctly, assailed for not doing so.

yeselson	716674108591837184	2016-04-03T17:09:57	DHasper I agree tax release more significant, but, in name of transparency. She should release speeches too.
yeselson	716673789069811713	2016-04-03T17:08:41	rad_mad09 aravosis I said she should release her speeches. But point isn't who is hypocrite, but is obviously right thing to do.
yeselson	716673293043036160	2016-04-03T17:06:42	eliasisquith No, it doesn't.
yeselson	716673079934640129	2016-04-03T17:05:52	Probably true. GOP remains default party of white America and federalism/sep of powers gives it enormous power.

yeselson	716669253588500481	2016-04-03T16:50:39	bmaz And yeah, Clinton should release speeches. But "hypocrisy" argument is always weak. What matters is: what is right? Sometimes cynical
yeselson	716669039276400640	2016-04-03T16:49:48	bmaz It's not what Clinton camp is saying, it's what he's saying--just release it! Goofy not to. Romney was badgered on this, rightfully.
yeselson	716668698287804417	2016-04-03T16:48:27	But logic of "abortion is murder" is to punish murderer. If mother strangled month old, should she be punished?  
yeselson	716665180193693698	2016-04-03T16:34:28	It is weird, I don't get it either. Speeches, tax returns--release everything but private correspondence.

yeselson	713565386785046528	2016-03-26T03:17:00	brianbeutler indeed. But then conservative entertainment complex as arm of GOP would have to change business model, too. That's a big deal!
yeselson	713564790556377088	2016-03-26T03:14:38	brianbeutler ScottMcConnell9 Tricky, I think, because many reformers also skeptical of immigration. Guess we'll see.
yeselson	713564083572850692	2016-03-26T03:11:49	brianbeutler ScottMcConnell9 And the 20ish just drops out of political system? They won't have a home with Democrats.
yeselson	713563714520281089	2016-03-26T03:10:21	brianbeutler ScottMcConnell9 But even if it's not all that, those people have to somehow be accounted for. Unless they just don't vote.
yeselson	713563311506374658	2016-03-26T03:08:45	brianbeutler I just think that this angry minority has to have a political outlet. It has to match up with with one of the major parties.
yeselson	713562260082409472	2016-03-26T03:04:34	brianbeutler Maybe. But then what do the millions of ethno-nationalists do? No viable third parties in the US.

yeselson	713561357866631168	2016-03-26T03:00:59	brianbeutler Don't think it's quite that frictionless. Clinton Dems-- professionals in the suburbs--still support more guv than R peers.
yeselson	713560870631170049	2016-03-26T02:59:03	ClinicEscort Oh I don't know--it's a really big country.
yeselson	713552068594823168	2016-03-26T02:24:04	brianbeutler Yeah, that's true, but that's not a big enough voter bloc to win a national election. Need the racists/nativists.

yeselson	713492743050362880	2016-03-25T22:28:20	brianbeutler But that's the part that the ethno-nationalists don't care as much about--the spinach. They need the nativist dessert, right?

yeselson	713131706585317376	2016-03-24T22:33:42	JoshuaMound jeffspross SeanMcElwee I think Yglesias's prolific work as a post college writer is more than enough to criticize.

yeselson	712759295134314496	2016-03-23T21:53:53	jneeley78 walterolson But there's an empirical issue here, so no president would say that. N. Korea is a total disaster. As it happens,

yeselson	712756352700063745	2016-03-23T21:42:11	jneeley78 walterolson baseballcrank The "praise" was about as mild as possible. And, again, everytime you say "get something out of it"

yeselson	709938705310601216	2016-03-16T03:05:52	mtracey Yup, without a doubt. Only an incredible anomaly like Trump was able to prevent him from being obvious winner.

yeselson	709917099389485058	2016-03-16T01:40:00	MattBruenig JoshuaMound SethAckerman yeah, it has changed, just not as much as you would like. But enough to block this.
yeselson	709916676117159936	2016-03-16T01:38:19	JoshuaMound SethAckerman Sure, name it, happy to.

yeselson	709911347870441472	2016-03-16T01:17:09	JoshuaMound SethAckerman Even if they were, it won't matter. Won't happen, party won't allow it. Reagan wanted to do that too--expanded SS

yeselson	709910040883363840	2016-03-16T01:11:57	JoshuaMound SethAckerman For that to happen, you'd have to believe that a new president would role party's most popular pol, Warren. Nope.

yeselson	709909475159842817	2016-03-16T01:09:43	JoshuaMound SethAckerman I don't agree--the party has moved left and she has moved left with it--but I'm not going to revisit whole thing.

yeselson	709895575119011842	2016-03-16T00:14:28	KevinMFeeney SethAckerman Right, agree. He's an important figure, and he stepped up when nobody else did, but he's limited too.
yeselson	709894786958888960	2016-03-16T00:11:21	KevinMFeeney SethAckerman Right--but that cuts in favor of them. Weakest part of Sander's campaign is his lack of policy chops.

yeselson	709893915894280192	2016-03-16T00:07:53	KevinMFeeney SethAckerman I don't agree with that. Sander's "socialism" is mostly branding. I don't think he is, substantively, much
yeselson	709892779204321280	2016-03-16T00:03:22	KevinMFeeney SethAckerman I think you will see more downballot types like Warren/Sherrod Brown.
yeselson	709892106073067520	2016-03-16T00:00:41	KevinMFeeney SethAckerman I don't think so. African Americans are cautious voters, but to the left on every issue, just not into Bernie.
yeselson	709891889235943425	2016-03-15T23:59:50	cdwbrklyn Yeah, I think that clarified things. How're you doing, Chris?
yeselson	709891195896537089	2016-03-15T23:57:04	Hey SethAckerman you really think Sanders isn't moving Clinton/centrist-Wall Street Dems to the left? Read this:

yeselson	709869594207453184	2016-03-15T22:31:14	rortybomb EliLake jpodhoretz And even then, you have to address: why did R's get Trump and D's get Sanders? That isn't random variance!
yeselson	709869334454280194	2016-03-15T22:30:12	Daniel0061824 I'm willing to believe that, but there's a reason the R's got Trump and the D's got Sanders.
yeselson	709868904441585665	2016-03-15T22:28:30	rortybomb EliLake jpodhoretz Yeah, the connection is real in that economic trauma linked to political trauma, but it's indirect, at best.
yeselson	709866884653555712	2016-03-15T22:20:28	Yeah, sure that's part of it. But it's not a coincidence that this ethno-nationaiism/racism happening within GOP.

yeselson	709794801084981248	2016-03-15T17:34:02	CK_MacLeod And I too, but I'd ask you to rethink that point and think about the core priorities of the GOP. It's not a controversial
yeselson	709794385643315200	2016-03-15T17:32:23	CK_MacLeod jonathanchait Right, but obviously "membership" isn't dispositive regarding smart analysis. That's just totally off point.

yeselson	709450960926543872	2016-03-14T18:47:44	robmickey karpmj However, I do, in fact, think Cruz is much better known for his **essential**--he opposes O'care, closes government--than
yeselson	709450594411532288	2016-03-14T18:46:17	karpmj robmickey I agree that Sanders is the candidate with current most favorables (along with, ironically, Rubio--he's doomed anyway).

yeselson	708083104557240320	2016-03-11T00:12:22	ryanlcooper ICUDrEd I just think reading and thinking about the changes since the 90s supports my contention. That's no longer the moment

yeselson	708079528007094272	2016-03-10T23:58:09	ryanlcooper I think that's exceedingly unlikely--that would wreck the party, it's not direction of either Dem base or even, as ZaidJilani
yeselson	708079298201128960	2016-03-10T23:57:14	ZaidJilani ryanlcooper It's hard to know what he will say or do, but generating nativist/racist rage, as we're seeing now, is a bad thing.
yeselson	708079015966449664	2016-03-10T23:56:07	ZaidJilani ryanlcooper I agree completely.

yeselson	708078226233499648	2016-03-10T23:52:59	ryanlcooper I think that's a misread of where the party is now. It's moved left--even Lawrence Summers has moved left. Base won't let it
yeselson	708078068489920512	2016-03-10T23:52:21	ZaidJilani ryanlcooper Right--we know that. Not sure what your point is.

yeselson	706500561726742530	2016-03-06T15:23:54	studentactivism Right, that makes a lot of sense. The few women, and few in positions of authority and power, the worse the problem.
yeselson	706497963841998852	2016-03-06T15:13:35	noahmccormack Right, I make operating assumption is bad--basically standard--everywhere, but bad could devolve to even worse.
yeselson	706497569342541824	2016-03-06T15:12:01	gabrielroth Yeah, and, as somebody else noted, fewer women in general.
yeselson	706497294540140544	2016-03-06T15:10:55	noahmccormack Ah, yeah, that's a great point, sure.
yeselson	706497197542666242	2016-03-06T15:10:32	mattyglesias Why do you think he would be a better president? I don't think he'd be worse, but don't see why he'd be better.

yeselson	706494077534081024	2016-03-06T14:58:08	EdwardGLuce Yes, but it does set a baseline by which to evaluate the extent of Trump's decline post debate, if any.
yeselson	706493408504893440	2016-03-06T14:55:29	EdwardGLuce No, from 3/1-3/3
yeselson	706490479890849792	2016-03-06T14:43:51	IChotiner willwilkinson dandrezner HeerJeet So, yes, their "mainstream" candidates now routinely accuse Obama of *wanting* to wreck US.
yeselson	706490264966324225	2016-03-06T14:42:59	IChotiner willwilkinson dandrezner HeerJeet But that's the way to look at it. GOP is sui generis major party formation in US history.
yeselson	706488145890713600	2016-03-06T14:34:34	ByronYork Which is, essentially, people already opposed to the ACA thinking that every premium increase is the fault of the law.
yeselson	706485588480954368	2016-03-06T14:24:24	IChotiner Sure, completely agree. He has has 100% name recognition and a not beloved Hillary kills him (lesser known Bernie does better).
yeselson	706483068417253376	2016-03-06T14:14:23	IChotiner It would be interesting to see the internals. He might, actually, be doing a bit better among www, but really bad with others.
yeselson	706479707865399296	2016-03-06T14:01:02	EsotericCD So, as I thought, this move is looking perfectly logical as of today. Cruz is only alternative to Trump, &lt; 100 delegates down.
yeselson	706344461912170496	2016-03-06T05:03:37	VerumVulnero1 Yeah. And "Trump is very strong" is "argument" the front runner makes.
yeselson	706343779452755968	2016-03-06T05:00:54	MattBruenig Yeah, I think Trump will probably beat Cruz. Lots of Northeastern states coming up.
yeselson	706343495519309825	2016-03-06T04:59:47	VerumVulnero1 Suspect the latter. Trump is so off the charts appalling that even Cruz is starting to seem appealing. Context is everything!

yeselson	706326127111966722	2016-03-06T03:50:46	JAMyerson TPCarney Yeah, agree. Good analogy. I find it an inadequate substitute, better than stays quo, but not good enough/flawed.
yeselson	706325756700442624	2016-03-06T03:49:17	JAMyerson TPCarney eliminate the need for it and allow all voters to have same amount of information when they vote.
yeselson	706325467666759680	2016-03-06T03:48:09	JAMyerson TPCarney I think the logic of giving people, especially working people, more time off from work is good. But holiday would
yeselson	706325108076449793	2016-03-06T03:46:43	JAMyerson TPCarney I would eliminate early voting if election days were holidays or else 24 hours over course of weekend.
yeselson	706324857697517568	2016-03-06T03:45:43	JAMyerson TPCarney I don't like it easier. It's a poor substitute for Election Day being a holiday. Things change even at last minute.
yeselson	706318524373995520	2016-03-06T03:20:33	Louisiana getting **very** weird--Trump's 25% lead with early voters now down to 4.8%! Slowly slowly, like FL 2000....
yeselson	706315572615614464	2016-03-06T03:08:49	Trump's LA lead over Cruz started out at over 25% w/ EVs only. Now it's 6.6% and closing, w/ less than half of precincts in.

yeselson	706300108502130688	2016-03-06T02:07:22	Cato_of_Utica Yeah, of course. Maybe it doesn't cost out. I gotta think more about this. It's good to have a debate about it.
yeselson	706298839272185857	2016-03-06T02:02:20	Cato_of_Utica maybe not. Are you going to respond to that piece?
yeselson	706298739573571585	2016-03-06T02:01:56	Cato_of_Utica Ok, I need to think more about this. My instinct is that flipping over a the table when we're losing might be worth it. But
yeselson	706298522656772097	2016-03-06T02:01:04	mattyglesias interfluidity Well, if they supported Bernie 3 or 4 to 1, it would matter enough.
yeselson	706297915384455168	2016-03-06T01:58:40	Cato_of_Utica You mean premise in support. Ok, I'm confused. Tweet out your view explicitly.
yeselson	706297627537752066	2016-03-06T01:57:31	Cato_of_Utica I think that's exactly what I'm thinking too. If unions get foot in door, then possibility of growth.
yeselson	706297256010510337	2016-03-06T01:56:02	Cato_of_Utica But--quickly skimming for now--you support them, right? I think I do too.

yeselson	706258003390033920	2016-03-05T23:20:04	dandrezner JimGoldgeier Yes, that's certainly true. If anybody could make that case, it would be Cruz--and include Rubio too.

yeselson	706254119045099520	2016-03-05T23:04:38	chucktodd RonBrownstein RickSantorum GovMikeHuckabee maggieNYT It means that Trump needs an organization to win caucuses.

yeselson	706156299000619008	2016-03-05T16:35:56	PhilPerspective RonBrownstein Sure--but primary cause stems from the party and its infrastructure. Generating racial resentment its thing.

yeselson	705888275945398272	2016-03-04T22:50:54	PatrickIber noahmccormack Yeah, that's kind of what I'm saying. And you can just view more like authoritarian populism of Thatcher.

yeselson	705885053298024448	2016-03-04T22:38:06	DanaHoule jeffspross Well, ok, then he's just a powerful vestige of the business wing of the Dems.

yeselson	705879226659037184	2016-03-04T22:14:56	DanaHoule jeffspross Well, that's the nature of the Democratic cross-pressures. Guys like Peterson should be primaried, if possible.
yeselson	705877772397367297	2016-03-04T22:09:10	DanaHoule jeffspross It spends $$ to beat those Dems in those states.
yeselson	705876496276185089	2016-03-04T22:04:05	DanaHoule jeffspross As these states become completely off the chart for national D's, those businesses will have less influence on party.
yeselson	705875874340593665	2016-03-04T22:01:37	DanaHoule jeffspross Right--again, D's much more cross-pressured than R's, even if less so than pre-civil rights party.

yeselson	705874821415084032	2016-03-04T21:57:26	DanaHoule jeffspross So GOP business elites affect that budget. But Dem business elites affect Dem budget, making the House lefty caucus

yeselson	705873676105883648	2016-03-04T21:52:53	DanaHoule jeffspross Well, the Trump campaign is very revealing in this regard. Movement cons like Ryan thought that their upward

yeselson	705427419419774976	2016-03-03T16:19:37	jeffspross eliasisquith ryanlcooper Yeah, should do that because it's the right thing to do. But not necessarily politically effective.
yeselson	705427085624528896	2016-03-03T16:18:18	eliasisquith jeffspross ryanlcooper Right jonathanchait wrote a brilliant essay about this the other day.
yeselson	705426375142989828	2016-03-03T16:15:28	eliasisquith jeffspross ryanlcooper It's that they didn't view economics as their top priority or trust guv to ensure good results.

yeselson	705251242914746368	2016-03-03T04:39:33	jeffspross Ah--right! Now I see that, rereading it. The "compliance" clause cancels out the alleged policy benefit.
yeselson	705249427770970112	2016-03-03T04:32:21	jeffspross Presumably a given state's requirements could be de minimis.
yeselson	705247642348097536	2016-03-03T04:25:15	So Trump screwed up by coming up with typically right wing (useless) health ins. policy rather than going to left of both donors and Dems.

yeselson	705233357618204673	2016-03-03T03:28:29	jeffspross JonCoppage Yeah, ok, got it now. You would need considerable union density to do that way, though, but yeah.

yeselson	705152823986692096	2016-03-02T22:08:29	ZaidJilani ckilpatrick mtracey leninology Argument is somehow that political leverage/movement building doesn't work. Worked on FDR tho.

yeselson	705152306363424768	2016-03-02T22:06:25	ZaidJilani ckilpatrick mtracey leninology Well, if that happens, and she sells out the left, you can say you were right. But don't be a
yeselson	705152179561242624	2016-03-02T22:05:55	ckilpatrick ZaidJilani mtracey leninology Actually, more "laborist" as I wrote in DissentMag than they have been in years.
yeselson	705152013403877376	2016-03-02T22:05:15	mtracey ZaidJilani ckilpatrick leninology DougHenwood Well, ok, guys, maybe not. That's why job is to move her left. Besides, you get

yeselson	705151578844602374	2016-03-02T22:03:32	ZaidJilani ckilpatrick mtracey leninology Ok--you win. I don't anything, like nothing, via experience or reading. But you know all.
yeselson	705151403459739648	2016-03-02T22:02:50	ckilpatrick ZaidJilani mtracey leninology Right except pathetic or not, she now supports national $12 minimum wage, talking about unions
yeselson	705151208730828800	2016-03-02T22:02:03	ZaidJilani ckilpatrick mtracey leninology Zaid, you were doing well without  insults for awhile. Also: I actually know a few things too.
yeselson	705150988735401985	2016-03-02T22:01:11	ckilpatrick mtracey leninology You're kidding, right? She talking about family leave. You may think it's pathetic, but she's on the
yeselson	705150447099756544	2016-03-02T21:59:02	ckilpatrick mtracey leninology Sure he is--she's talking about issues that she never would if he (or somebody like him) hadn't run.
yeselson	705150264538480641	2016-03-02T21:58:18	helitzur It's a mess--even the very shrewed McConnell is just making educated guesses as to what will "work."
yeselson	705150074301472769	2016-03-02T21:57:33	mtracey ckilpatrick leninology He's not going to win, but he should stay in, keep pushing Clinton to left and the popular front vs. Trump
yeselson	705149143933689856	2016-03-02T21:53:51	helitzur Yeah, agree that is not well thought thru.
yeselson	705148667120979970	2016-03-02T21:51:57	jonathanchait j_henry2 Huh--well this is why it's always important, but not decisive, to get the artist's reading of his own work.
yeselson	705148453698052097	2016-03-02T21:51:07	helitzur I'm not "unrooting" for him. He's called several questions re future of GOP. I think Clinton will decisively beat him.
yeselson	705145416363409409	2016-03-02T21:39:02	j_henry2 jonathanchait Well.... Also: when you get an inspiration of that magnitude, you can't sleep on it. Too yuge.
yeselson	705144256147677188	2016-03-02T21:34:26	Btw, people who aren't in awe of jonathanchait "Goodbye, Rubio Tuesday" header should give credit where due (haters can resume after that).
yeselson	705143543954804736	2016-03-02T21:31:36	I wouldn't take him for granted. But nobody he's going to lose Florida right off the bat and he won't be able to make that up.
yeselson	705142525451964417	2016-03-02T21:27:33	People who think Trump has a good chance to win should be granted, "you never know with him!" But "angry white workers" aren't enough.
yeselson	705142132219236353	2016-03-02T21:25:59	alexhazanov Well--if you consider, despite all that, the right of women to vote as an unqualified, egalitarian good thing, yeah.
yeselson	705139900669104128	2016-03-02T21:17:07	Thing is: there is a very large, disparate and exploited working class--but that's different than white male manufacturing workers.
yeselson	705139579381288963	2016-03-02T21:15:51	Right. Both left and right often romanticize white (male) workers on behalf of different policy ends. It's not 1946. 
yeselson	705137753575526401	2016-03-02T21:08:35	About this Klan as "leftist organization" nonsense. Absurd, except in one instance: supported women's suffrage.
yeselson	705125137134313473	2016-03-02T20:18:27	mkazin That's why I said the last half century. '48 is really the big exception. In '52, both parties had fights, so a toss-up.
yeselson	705124893738844161	2016-03-02T20:17:29	ByronYork stuartpstevens That's why GOP screwed: people enabled  racists/nativists/anti-intellectuals-but now they've won. jonathanchait
yeselson	705123035230109696	2016-03-02T20:10:06	In last half century every time there was deeply riven major party convention-two for R's, three for D's-that party's nominee lost election.
yeselson	705119001484124164	2016-03-02T19:54:05	JonCoppage especially when writers don't fully understand their continued benefits or offer any alternative but "Think of something else."
yeselson	705118671430090752	2016-03-02T19:52:46	JonCoppage better for workers to have have collective bargaining protections than not. It's glib to say unions don't work anymore
yeselson	705118462759333888	2016-03-02T19:51:56	JonCoppage manufacturing, the continued strength of the IG Metal in Germany--despite some job losses and wage stasis--shows that its always

yeselson	705117863309348866	2016-03-02T19:49:33	JonCoppage And there are 50-60 million jobs in the US workforce--which is a lot--that can't be moved: hospitality, health care,
yeselson	705117620970905601	2016-03-02T19:48:35	JonCoppage asserts. Unions do the same thing they always do **as long as they cover an entire sector.** They take wages out of competition.
yeselson	705117447439949824	2016-03-02T19:47:54	JonCoppage A bit much for twitter, but basically: there's something to this, esp. regarding globalized sectors, but much less than WRM
yeselson	705066607366836224	2016-03-02T16:25:53	sam_rosenfeld MichaelCohen212 Yeah--but agree, it absolutely would have been a brilliant move--and wrecked the GOP even that much more.
yeselson	705065768627642369	2016-03-02T16:22:33	siderealization karpmj True--but, as it happens, Warren and Brown are both terrific politicians and Brown comes from very diverse state.
yeselson	705055848008163332	2016-03-02T15:43:08	sam_rosenfeld night when he proudly noted that Larry Kudlow had praised his tax plan!
yeselson	705055750352183297	2016-03-02T15:42:44	sam_rosenfeld That would have been a brilliant, gutsy move--but he's not that smart or unorthodox in that way. You could see that last
yeselson	705054403443728384	2016-03-02T15:37:23	sam_rosenfeld You mean he should have actually proposed a redistributive plan for workers/poor/middle class?
yeselson	705048286898610176	2016-03-02T15:13:05	karpmj He's done well, about what you'd expect. Not clear if Warren or Sherrod Brown would have been a better left insurgent or not.
yeselson	705048050553724930	2016-03-02T15:12:09	karpmj And Sanders has had a lot of money and campaign pros in charge of the operation--this stuff can be set up. Not the major factor here
yeselson	705047769854119937	2016-03-02T15:11:02	karpmj I'm not saying it doesn't matter at all. But, by definition, the insurgent will have to make some ground there. Just the way it is.
yeselson	705046155525226500	2016-03-02T15:04:37	karpmj This is kind of playing out the way one would expect. Sanders can't break thru with black voters and small % of moderate white D's.
yeselson	705045673742372864	2016-03-02T15:02:42	karpmj As Trump is demonstration, GOTV is worth a couple of points ( so say the political scientists). If you lose by a lot, not big deal.
yeselson	705044550067294208	2016-03-02T14:58:14	karpmj Bernie's raising more money than Clinton now--just announced 40 million last month, which is off the charts. Resources not an issue.
yeselson	705042684742868992	2016-03-02T14:50:49	grudging1 Honestly don't know, maybe not.
yeselson	705042404668211200	2016-03-02T14:49:42	karpmj Not sure what you mean by "stretched thin on resources?" That's definitely not a Bernie problem--outspent Clinton in SC. Lots of $$$
yeselson	705040224942948353	2016-03-02T14:41:03	grudging1 Well, they're apparently offering him a chance to be GOP senate nominee in FL--so they do want him out of the way.
yeselson	705040038480973824	2016-03-02T14:40:18	DavidKaib Ha--indeed.
yeselson	705039616953466880	2016-03-02T14:38:38	A small matter, but can people stop saying that Ben Carson is a "nice man", rather than a narcissist suffused with messianic delusions?
yeselson	705035630477180929	2016-03-02T14:22:47	People who, left or right, who think Trump has  a good chance to win general should read mattyglesias:

yeselson	705022097060438017	2016-03-02T13:29:01	jeffhauser If he's got 40-45% of the delegates and they steal it, party splits; if they don't, party splits.

yeselson	704913483553501184	2016-03-02T06:17:25	alexhazanov Right--when you add that to his Latino "issues", this is a guy who will get 12-14% of non-white vote, rather than Mitt's 20%.
yeselson	704912475079237632	2016-03-02T06:13:25	Republicans hoping that non-Obama led Dem ticket might get &lt; mid 90s of black voter won't enjoy ads Ds run of Trump's answer re David Duke.

yeselson	704880577896386560	2016-03-02T04:06:40	jledbetter Other problem is that, at end of night, SteveKornacki is saying Trump will have about 350. So not such a big spread.
yeselson	704879435959443457	2016-03-02T04:02:08	JayCostTWS If I were next network doing GOP debate, I'd just delete Carson. Just construct a new standard and say he doesn't meet it.

yeselson	704450729507995649	2016-02-29T23:38:36	DouthatNYT Right--but he's only made more explicit what was the play for years. Listen to Limbaugh for ten minutes! So there is now a

yeselson	704450030535573508	2016-02-29T23:35:49	DouthatNYT I have some thoughts on that, but I grant that it's a very tough challenge. I'm only saying that--as you would certainly agree--
yeselson	704449078961303553	2016-02-29T23:32:03	What reformocons aren't confronting: Trump's appeal to white workers isn't just economic, but nativist/racist.

yeselson	704420332086628353	2016-02-29T21:37:49	notstevenwhite Yeah, he might be able to get out of it. Or just say, as he already has, "Look, I'm world's greatest dealmaker--trust me."

yeselson	704414997254967298	2016-02-29T21:16:37	Actually, for understanding Trump, the second Klan of the 1920s is more relevant. Try this:

yeselson	704408938855440384	2016-02-29T20:52:32	Trump's ceiling may be "hard." But Cruz's ceiling looks kind of like the ones here:

yeselson	704380354149355521	2016-02-29T18:58:57	Agree--fine explication of the Trump Moment. 
yeselson	704378783692931072	2016-02-29T18:52:43	SteveKornacki right--it's a bit late in the game to think that Trump does not represent a large/very engaged constituency.
yeselson	704356370057818112	2016-02-29T17:23:39	Greg651 tedfrank maybe, but kind of a weird coincidence. Suspect he knows there is a void on the right now and he will do more of this.

yeselson	704355412116504576	2016-02-29T17:19:51	This would be more persuasive if CNN poll today didn't have Trump with 49% of GOP voters. 
yeselson	704354179121164290	2016-02-29T17:14:57	Thomas knows he needs to step up. He now carries the burdens of anachronistic reaction on his shoulders. 
yeselson	704316278790553600	2016-02-29T14:44:21	As expected (by me anyway), CNN national poll with Trump at 49% reveals that bandwagon effect kicked in--no "low ceiling" for Trump.

yeselson	704033932015222786	2016-02-28T20:02:24	DouthatNYT The criticism that's fair--also Maddie in Jeff Cowie's important new book-that cosmopolitanism makes egalitarianism problematic.

yeselson	704032869631528961	2016-02-28T19:58:11	Right. When elite NRO publishes people like Beck and Erikson to oppose Trump, it only underscores GOPs bankruptcy.
