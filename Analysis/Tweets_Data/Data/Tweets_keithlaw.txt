keithlaw	725797223863296001	2016-04-28T21:21:57	OneBrightBlue1 matzacski You keep assuming "more experience" is better. He could also get hurt, age poorly, lose his speed, etc.
keithlaw	725795747501891584	2016-04-28T21:16:05	_JBloomfield Yanks23242 my objection to this thinking is that the extra ~1 win of value now is likely worth more than 5 wins in 2022.
keithlaw	725795503405961217	2016-04-28T21:15:07	matzacski OneBrightBlue1 Completely disagree that it's "the right move." Team is built to win in 2016. Being penurious now is foolhardy.
keithlaw	725790508082184192	2016-04-28T20:55:16	OneBrightBlue1 Turner is very likely to be better than Espinoza and one or two wins could easily matter this year.

keithlaw	725168401593815041	2016-04-27T03:43:14	EricRueb affirming the consequent. Some hitters have hit some pitchers well. It doesn't mean they'll continue to do so.

keithlaw	724795163340619776	2016-04-26T03:00:07	Yep. Lance Barrett is like Yosemite Sam meets Mr. Magoo back there tonight. 
keithlaw	724779788884410370	2016-04-26T01:59:02	.442 OBP for Conforto in the 3 slot -- tiny sample, but I would hope this leads Collins to just leave him there
keithlaw	724779010786471937	2016-04-26T01:55:56	ChrisRosenbluth yep, you won that one. Weird to pull him for RHB, rather than one batter later.
keithlaw	724778860131278848	2016-04-26T01:55:20	sunsfans_1674 My opinion would never change on any player after two weeks of games. It's too small a sample.
keithlaw	724773430193704962	2016-04-26T01:33:46	Didn't even seem like that bad a pitch from Thor. Cozart did a nice job to go get it.
keithlaw	724772939325935616	2016-04-26T01:31:49	ChrisRosenbluth devil's advocate - got Schebler-PH-Hamilton coming up. Weakest part of the order.
keithlaw	724772482041929729	2016-04-26T01:29:59	sunsfans_1674 in a 16 game sample, yeah, they are. Why did you tweet this at me in the first place?

keithlaw	724772075525787649	2016-04-26T01:28:23	NB0578 didn't see a third pitch from him in bradenton last month
keithlaw	724772028063092736	2016-04-26T01:28:11	RyanPalencer yep, that's what I saw in the spring
keithlaw	724761769076527104	2016-04-26T00:47:25	sunsfans_1674 hasn't been playing great D, and he also leads the league in AB last I checked.

keithlaw	724760194253737988	2016-04-26T00:41:10	I discussed him in the post that ranked Boston's top prospects this offseason:  
keithlaw	724759105919963136	2016-04-26T00:36:50	Tough night for Portland P Kevin McAvoy: 1.2 IP, 0 H, 1 K, 6 BB.
keithlaw	724758216316489728	2016-04-26T00:33:18	Kreepy_Kralle24 I think he's had multiple issues, but Buck &amp; Co moving him around on the rubber has been one of them
keithlaw	724740838539046913	2016-04-25T23:24:15	Kreepy_Kralle24 never been about velocity with him
keithlaw	724737986957553668	2016-04-25T23:12:55	You'll be able to tell teams think the rough date has passed in early June when a bunch of prospects get recalled 
keithlaw	724737791494594561	2016-04-25T23:12:09	GValenzuelaSD nope, I see someone saying something to a woman that he'd never say in person. Grow up.
keithlaw	724735354771804160	2016-04-25T23:02:28	phogan87 That was not the super 2 issue; that was free agency. Bryant will be a super 2 arb player after 2017.
keithlaw	724733561564221440	2016-04-25T22:55:20	Rosab315 nealan_ Buster_ESPN wrong issue.
keithlaw	724733511157035008	2016-04-25T22:55:08	mevans1114 yeah not at all what we're talking about here.
keithlaw	724733458996682752	2016-04-25T22:54:56	GValenzuelaSD so, someday, when someone calls that little girl in your pic a "slut," it'll be OK b/c she'll have heard worse?
keithlaw	724732102349074432	2016-04-25T22:49:32	Correct. It's not a single date each year, and teams have to estimate when it will be.

keithlaw	724731130914721794	2016-04-25T22:45:41	There is no "super 2 deadline." It's one of the worst terms ever invented by sports media. It. Does. Not. Exist. 
keithlaw	724731039193665536	2016-04-25T22:45:19	GValenzuelaSD Because you tweeted that to a woman, and because vasodilation is not inflammation, genius.
keithlaw	724726440227430401	2016-04-25T22:27:02	GValenzuelaSD are you teaching the little boy in your profile pic how to harass women? Or teaching the girl to shut up and accept it?
keithlaw	724719830536953857	2016-04-25T22:00:46	By definition it's something. There is no "good" inflammation that I know of. Stephania_ESPN 
keithlaw	724710357105782784	2016-04-25T21:23:08	JasonKeener not a very good defender but he can hit. Doubt we see him before June.
keithlaw	724708773600870401	2016-04-25T21:16:50	MRosenUSC I think the increased velo would increase stress
keithlaw	724705531802296322	2016-04-25T21:03:57	Velocity had spiked this spring. Hope this turns out to be nothing.

keithlaw	724063048252706816	2016-04-24T02:30:57	kevinms89 true. But there really isn't enough predictive value in how the pitcher has been throwing to let that overwhelm other factors
keithlaw	724059431324012544	2016-04-24T02:16:35	Sure you do. A pitcher who is "dealing" is, what, two bad pitches from "not dealing?"

keithlaw	719525341069447168	2016-04-11T13:59:44	Hirschbeck's history includes incidents with Alomar, Harper, Puig, Tulo, &amp; Sano, and he allegedly threatened Rob Manfred in 2003.
keithlaw	719522169726885888	2016-04-11T13:47:07	Like I said, Hirschbeck has a history. Seems to frequently be with young players, too. 
keithlaw	719513798273540096	2016-04-11T13:13:52	Bcicles Title IX will probably need a revision if college athletes start getting paid. Women's BB is the only revenue sport for girls.

keithlaw	719507506406559744	2016-04-11T12:48:51	Bcicles I agree with you here. Race &amp; class are linked in the US but the system would be as bad if all players were one race.
keithlaw	719506964586356736	2016-04-11T12:46:42	keithlaw That said I fear Buster_ESPN is right in practical terms about players getting reputations and umps holding grudges.
keithlaw	719506847317757952	2016-04-11T12:46:14	Bcicles When it was mostly white, it was a class problem, rich exploiting poor.
keithlaw	719506750626492416	2016-04-11T12:45:51	Bcicles No, that's a strawman. We're not OK with the exploitation at all. The structural racism is a second problem piled on top.
keithlaw	719506553213214722	2016-04-11T12:45:04	I disagree. Ump blew the call, appears to swear at Sano. And I'd hope umps' opinions of players don't affect calls.

keithlaw	719487895086764033	2016-04-11T11:30:56	SwansonMeat humancasino correct but the impact falls disproportionately on African-American kids. Therefore, it's structural racism.

keithlaw	718825978072576000	2016-04-09T15:40:42	chrisrbleak There was a similar story around Alzheimer's research maybe 15 years ago. Seems more likely in less public arenas.
keithlaw	718825903866961920	2016-04-09T15:40:25	chrisrbleak Not really - that topic is so politicized and public that it would be impossible to do this to a contrary report.
keithlaw	718825658407919616	2016-04-09T15:39:26	EricHoudini12 Mister_Figjam I live and laugh just fine, thanks.
keithlaw	718824021048078339	2016-04-09T15:32:56	cjtakoz I agree, but people who don't follow my work see that stuff and think otherwise - and often tweet insults at me as a result.
keithlaw	718823848527970304	2016-04-09T15:32:15	BruceDank Part of the problem here is that six games is such a small sample that saying I was or wasn't wrong is absurd.
keithlaw	718822245326548992	2016-04-09T15:25:53	cjtakoz It's not that my opinions are "sacred," but that the account serves to mock people solely in hindsight. Is your job a big joke?
keithlaw	718822043379220480	2016-04-09T15:25:04	McKendryMM12 He's doing it to mock, which I don't appreciate, and doing it without context. I have written way more than that on Story.
keithlaw	718820604217004032	2016-04-09T15:19:21	cjtakoz ethan_witte Jferrie23 Nope. Read better.

keithlaw	718819883362988032	2016-04-09T15:16:29	Mister_Figjam Not me. I just don't appreciate drive-by attacks. Great Radiohead quote, BTW.

keithlaw	718812807190462468	2016-04-09T14:48:22	a_foss30 swing has changed a lot since HS (that initial tweet), I think he sells out a bit for power compromising the hit tool

keithlaw	718809110838435840	2016-04-09T14:33:41	parkervb pllarson23 The concept of pulling five-year-old tweets without context (here based on all of 6 games) to mock me is awful.

keithlaw	716301480760844289	2016-04-02T16:29:15	Matt_Service agreed. Hard to get those on the agenda if people think Native Americans aren't real people.

keithlaw	716052600563613696	2016-04-02T00:00:18	I prefer "This Isn't It." You know, by Diff'rent Strokes.

keithlaw	715747166229278721	2016-04-01T03:46:37	MeisterNJ you had to know I was going to hate this, right? Disturbed and their ilk have never appealed to me.

keithlaw	715730250941014017	2016-04-01T02:39:24	Well, if that's true, it's a rather unfortunate trait in a manager. 
keithlaw	715722004100472832	2016-04-01T02:06:37	I discussed it in my chat today:  
keithlaw	715721290200530944	2016-04-01T02:03:47	Yes. I hate it with the fire of a blue supergiant about to go supernova.  
keithlaw	715712204750848001	2016-04-01T01:27:41	EricDeBoskey You're revising history here. Good night.
keithlaw	715706949485129729	2016-04-01T01:06:48	EricDeBoskey I don't agree at all with that assessment. CK didn't go 1-1 himself.

keithlaw	715618368850624513	2016-03-31T19:14:49	Today's Klawchat transcript: 
keithlaw	715598182273650689	2016-03-31T17:54:36	Klawchat starting at 2 pm ET: 
keithlaw	715580812511617024	2016-03-31T16:45:35	Saw Ron Paul on TV and my first thought was "wow, Bobby Valentine isn't aging well"
keithlaw	715564780782755840	2016-03-31T15:41:52	__Invader_ZIM desTROYed1717 so they can't do whatever they want. You were indeed wrong.
keithlaw	715563670558883840	2016-03-31T15:37:28	__Invader_ZIM desTROYed1717 whatever they want? So they could decline to employ players of color?
keithlaw	715563414966370306	2016-03-31T15:36:27	I'd rather hear about this than Matt Harvey's pisiform 
keithlaw	715558172833017856	2016-03-31T15:15:37	I answered Buster's question (and yours) on Bauer in this 
keithlaw	715546511237652480	2016-03-31T14:29:17	I love all these announcements. Bunch of kids seeing their lifelong dreams come true this week.  
keithlaw	715387619098693632	2016-03-31T03:57:54	CourtneyHosking I haven't shaved in a week
keithlaw	715363281083449344	2016-03-31T02:21:11	SeanyDooWop I think it's the mix of fruits and vegetables (I used just what Karen used) that made it great.
keithlaw	715360880188342272	2016-03-31T02:11:39	SeanyDooWop I did a steak salad. No glaze but rubbed with salt pepper cumin coriander chile powder
keithlaw	715358695224451072	2016-03-31T02:02:58	I would love to see MLB_PLAYERS do just that.  
keithlaw	715358523362840576	2016-03-31T02:02:17	Steve_Smith24 so the policy can't stand. And these players are members of a union, which could easily smack this policy down.
keithlaw	715355709853011968	2016-03-31T01:51:06	Steve_Smith24 That's not even legal. An employee who has facial hair for religious reasons would be protected by law.
keithlaw	715353043638882304	2016-03-31T01:40:30	Oh FFS. It's stupid enough when the Yankees do this but this is pathetic.  
keithlaw	715332291048955908	2016-03-31T00:18:03	EmmaBaccellieri use me as a reference, it's all good
keithlaw	715331962517499904	2016-03-31T00:16:44	EmmaBaccellieri overrated anyway
keithlaw	715308350758588420	2016-03-30T22:42:55	patrickjule years ago, one album that didn't grab me.
keithlaw	715303675644801024	2016-03-30T22:24:20	CheneyLWOS doubt that. And I don't base my rankings on organizational context like that.
keithlaw	715302260402692099	2016-03-30T22:18:43	patrickjule like the first album not so much the second
keithlaw	715297719124930560	2016-03-30T22:00:40	Every bit as close as he was before the spring (and not any closer) 
keithlaw	715281587659808768	2016-03-30T20:56:34	patricknray michael? Yeah I think so
keithlaw	715263698802049024	2016-03-30T19:45:29	keithlaw The Kepler/optics joke in today's insider piece made me legit laugh out loud. I can always count on one of those from you.

keithlaw	715008296118300674	2016-03-30T02:50:36	CourtneyHosking The secrecy and delays should probably tell you something.

keithlaw	714913495247138816	2016-03-29T20:33:54	Jramcube less concerned about velocity than command and pitching plan. But velocity is good.
keithlaw	714856943920234496	2016-03-29T16:49:11	McCulloughTimes ouch, hardo reply
keithlaw	714856772809441281	2016-03-29T16:48:30	Wow they're more desperate for pitching than I realized 
keithlaw	714840706800549888	2016-03-29T15:44:40	Depends on other players but I think midyear is reasonable and he doesn't have to move to DH 
keithlaw	714812845515542528	2016-03-29T13:53:57	My daughter used to be like this. Then she turned five.

keithlaw	712386126103908353	2016-03-22T21:11:02	zsmitty16 JoshMichael1986 nonsense. China remains a highly repressive society and major human rights violator.

keithlaw	712367857150140421	2016-03-22T19:58:26	zsmitty16 Sanctions didn't help them one iota. Cuba has already released a few dozen.

keithlaw	710594442986692608	2016-03-17T22:31:32	ab03 An hour ago I was finishing up a Klawchat. Sorry.

keithlaw	710542279958724608	2016-03-17T19:04:15	RubenKarter I have nothing to offer on this.
keithlaw	710540465049899008	2016-03-17T18:57:02	DickLittle1 It would not be the first time, or the millionth time, an actual rape went unprosecuted.
keithlaw	710520385364758530	2016-03-17T17:37:15	JeremyTiermini the US district attorney declined to explain why she didn't poll the grand jury.
keithlaw	710518947121143808	2016-03-17T17:31:32	The USATODAY story on the lawsuit accusing Simon of rape includes graphic, disturbing details from the rape kit: 
keithlaw	710518715712978945	2016-03-17T17:30:37	npthree No, that's not what it means. Your gender appears to be preventing you from thinking clearly.
keithlaw	710518521730637825	2016-03-17T17:29:51	npthree Nope. You're confusing legal judgments with facts.
keithlaw	710518148190117889	2016-03-17T17:28:21	lizzyf620 🤘
keithlaw	710517909852921856	2016-03-17T17:27:25	npthree Also fact: the results of the rape kit, including anal tearing. 
keithlaw	710516898363019264	2016-03-17T17:23:23	npthree It's embarrassingly sexist to assume a woman alleging rape is making a "money grab," especially with what an investigation entails.
keithlaw	710516597413318656	2016-03-17T17:22:12	npthree I prefer to stick to facts too, like the fact that rape prosecution rates fall far short of actual rape rates.
keithlaw	710514763298693120	2016-03-17T17:14:54	npthree accused of paying off a key witness, and lack of charges in rape case means zilch.
keithlaw	710514098069446656	2016-03-17T17:12:16	JonesCurtisW He admitted firing the gun, and a key witness changed his testimony, which prosecutors allege was due to Simon paying them.
keithlaw	710512600820408320	2016-03-17T17:06:19	Alfredo Simon killed a man in the DR, and later was accused of rape by a woman who was too drunk to consent. This is the best we can do?

keithlaw	708459353838215168	2016-03-12T01:07:27	dmad1433 UConnBaseball "only" is a ridiculous word to use here. MLB clubs wouldn't typically let a prospect throw that much in the minors.

keithlaw	708452178055208961	2016-03-12T00:38:56	IDoNotGiveAdam drivelinebases That's wrong. The original box score included all pitchers' totals in McCaffrey's line. It's been fixed.

keithlaw	707673195768209408	2016-03-09T21:03:32	chisportsfan03 I think we disagree here on the probability that the allegations were true - but neither of us can prove it.
keithlaw	707672754317754368	2016-03-09T21:01:47	chisportsfan03 Yes, his image is tainted, and that's why he was a terrible choice for a cover story. Where did I say he was guilty again?

keithlaw	707240000220499968	2016-03-08T16:22:10	KyleSammin lizzyf620 I agree. It's a garbage stat. Like saying a great pitcher is great but doing so by citing his win total.

keithlaw	707239415970717696	2016-03-08T16:19:51	lizzyf620 Even when controlling for those variables, there's still a gap. It's smaller, maybe 5%, but exists.
keithlaw	707235582162894848	2016-03-08T16:04:37	lizzyf620 There is a wage gap, though; it's just not this 77-79 cents per dollar figure.

keithlaw	705408960589791232	2016-03-03T15:06:16	shaneloux I remember controversy over Pulsipher's IP when he was 20. It wasn't accepted like it is today but we knew innings might matter.

keithlaw	705267685957832704	2016-03-03T05:44:54	Lark_11 not IMO.

keithlaw	705255945425670144	2016-03-03T04:58:15	jaysonbuford I also don't think he's a good rapper in terms of flow, tempo, rhythm.
keithlaw	705254079610507264	2016-03-03T04:50:50	jaysonbuford and I thought it was boring and unworthy of the praise.

keithlaw	704791832350191616	2016-03-01T22:14:01	JerseyJonK I agree. We know at least one thing that happened that's unacceptable. Most likely more did.

keithlaw	704783567390289922	2016-03-01T21:41:11	MetsDaddy2013 Oh, I bet they have something.
keithlaw	704783462679474176	2016-03-01T21:40:46	MetsDaddy2013 Why risk having an arbitrator gut the first suspension for DV and wreck your precedent?
keithlaw	704782598795493376	2016-03-01T21:37:20	MetsDaddy2013 well, you did refer to people commending MLB as "clueless" in the piece. I think we're just mindful of MLB's leverage here.
keithlaw	704782433850241026	2016-03-01T21:36:41	krisnorth_85 You said "due process," though. I think he got his due process under the terms of the CBA/DV addendum.
keithlaw	704782303898144768	2016-03-01T21:36:10	chuckvanhorn91 MLB False analogy. Esp since MLB players get 0 games for marijuana.
keithlaw	704782177255337984	2016-03-01T21:35:39	MetsDaddy2013 Totally disagree, nor do I think I'm "clueless." If MLB had more definitive proof, the suspension would have been longer.

keithlaw	703803851007266817	2016-02-28T04:48:08	RDLARK You claimed incestuous marriages might be covered by 14A. This is absurd and no US court has ever accepted this claim.
keithlaw	703803638821560324	2016-02-28T04:47:18	RDLARK Nope. Bad read by you.
keithlaw	703802739965435904	2016-02-28T04:43:43	RDLARK BethAbernathy2 Find me a court that has upheld your (bogus) 14A argument and then we can continue this. Good luck.
keithlaw	703801854510112768	2016-02-28T04:40:12	RDLARK BethAbernathy2 I went nowhere; you broached incest, which is banned for other reasons (consent and preventing inbreeding).
keithlaw	703801672506675201	2016-02-28T04:39:29	RDLARK BethAbernathy2 Finally found the case I wanted: CA court denied 14A objection to law banning incest. 
keithlaw	703801151490297856	2016-02-28T04:37:25	RDLARK BethAbernathy2 but it's nice that you compare homosexuality and interracial relationships to incest.
keithlaw	703801020225339393	2016-02-28T04:36:53	RDLARK BethAbernathy2 laws against such marriages are driven as much by issues over consent, the same reason 14A doesn't protect polygamy.
keithlaw	703799447172608000	2016-02-28T04:30:38	RDLARK BethAbernathy2 Your "more narrow reading" exception would also excuse those who opposed the decision in Loving v. Virginia.
keithlaw	703799225147068416	2016-02-28T04:29:45	RDLARK BethAbernathy2 This "more narrow reading" means ignoring the part about no state denying any person equal protection. Doesn't work.
keithlaw	703797776044453888	2016-02-28T04:24:00	JonLombardo I don't include them for a reason, and have never answered this type of question for the same reason.
keithlaw	703797583152594944	2016-02-28T04:23:14	RDLARK BethAbernathy2 "Reasonable minds" cannot. Those clouded by unreason might not like it, but 14A provides equal protection for all.
keithlaw	703797188263071744	2016-02-28T04:21:40	BethAbernathy2 This is wrong because of 14A, and b/c so many federal policies (like tax laws or SSA) involve marital status.
keithlaw	703771427401539584	2016-02-28T02:39:18	BethAbernathy2 I don't think that was ever more evident than in his longstanding war against marriage equality, which 14A guarantees.
keithlaw	703771290113548288	2016-02-28T02:38:45	BethAbernathy2 But you said Scalia "interpreted constitution as written." He ignored its text when it suited his religious beliefs.
keithlaw	703770332289757184	2016-02-28T02:34:57	DKaplanWTAE yep 
keithlaw	703766270492196864	2016-02-28T02:18:48	BethAbernathy2 More to the point, such religious considerations do not belong in judicial decisions, per 1A and Reynolds v US
keithlaw	703766135309778944	2016-02-28T02:18:16	BethAbernathy2 Plenty of evidence to support the theory of evolution. Science does not answer "why."
