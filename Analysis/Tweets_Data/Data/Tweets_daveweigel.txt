daveweigel	713407698101006337	2016-03-25T16:50:24	Cruz also navigates around the term ratf**ker: "Donald may be a rodent but I have no desire to copulate with him."
daveweigel	713407344336613378	2016-03-25T16:49:00	Cruz says National Enquirer story is "garbage," blames "Donald Trump and his henchmen."
daveweigel	713406931298160640	2016-03-25T16:47:21	Today, unlike yesterday, Cruz kicks off presser w Trump attack. "How low will Donald go? Is there any low to which he will not stoop?"
daveweigel	713397991990800384	2016-03-25T16:11:50	Cruz, asked why Trump is able to cancel debates, goes off. "Donald has a real problem: He doesn't know what he's talking about."

daveweigel	713135435787214848	2016-03-24T22:48:31	Cruz, stating the often-obscured point of this election: ‚ÄúWhat y‚Äôall did in Wisconsin is what we need to do in Washington."
daveweigel	713135155293110273	2016-03-24T22:47:25	Cruz now heaping praise on Scott Walker and Paul Ryan.
daveweigel	713134919942164480	2016-03-24T22:46:28	Real revenue per capita grew about half as much under Reagan as it did under Clinton, who raised taxes.

daveweigel	713106129035857921	2016-03-24T20:52:04	IMHO it's idiotic for Trump to discuss the wife stuff at all. If he shut up, conversation would be about Brussels, issue that breaks his way
daveweigel	713103006850482177	2016-03-24T20:39:40	Yes. I've seen Cruz twice since then; he only mentions Utah. (I would, too!) 
daveweigel	713102078290341888	2016-03-24T20:35:58	Cruz is using the Trump tweets to insist that the frontrunner is flailing and panicking bc he lost UT, erasing AZ from the story.
daveweigel	713100913536274432	2016-03-24T20:31:21	Yes. Trump is entirely at fault. Just saying, Cruz's daughters are like the last two humans he hasn't insulted.

daveweigel	713100100369784832	2016-03-24T20:28:07	FWIW Trump criticized the cartoon about Cruz's kids that Cruz obliquely referred to today 
daveweigel	713099697834078208	2016-03-24T20:26:31	Damn it, 2016, I am going to find you in an alley and run you down with my car. 
daveweigel	713099268534444033	2016-03-24T20:24:49	Indeed, and I say so in the article. But in the soundbite it sounds like he's adding to Trump's list of calumnies 
daveweigel	713098949582827520	2016-03-24T20:23:32	Btw are we defending the stupidity of the LizMair ad on the grounds that hey, at least it rattled Trump?
daveweigel	713098429803708416	2016-03-24T20:21:29	He didn't bring it up. Was asked four Qs about it by reporters until local reporters asked about Muslim patrols. 
daveweigel	713098017025499136	2016-03-24T20:19:50	He's probably saving that for 11:45 some night next week. 
daveweigel	713097672366944257	2016-03-24T20:18:28	I also talked to workers at the Cruz event about their cost of living, but you know, Trump tweet.
daveweigel	713096967899852801	2016-03-24T20:15:40	Great responses by Cruz. The article is typically biased, which is what one expects from the Washington Compost. 
daveweigel	713097176763785216	2016-03-24T20:16:30	Notice how Cruz ups the ante. "You mess with my wife, you mess with my kids" -- Trump hasn't said anything about the kids.
daveweigel	713090415109533696	2016-03-24T19:49:38	Cruz to Trump: "You're a sniveling coward. Leave Heidi the hell alone." 
daveweigel	713075939941425152	2016-03-24T18:52:07	More Cruz: "Donald, you‚Äôre a sniveling coward, leave Heidi the hell alone."
daveweigel	713075528065019908	2016-03-24T18:50:28	Cruz: "I‚Äôm not looking forward to telling the girls why Donald Trump is launching insults and attacks at their mother." (Yes, still this)

daveweigel	706333230807523328	2016-03-06T04:18:59	Those TV ads mostly quote Trump investigations by reporters. 
daveweigel	706332695077347328	2016-03-06T04:16:52	Rubio spokesman AlexConant responds to Trump calling on Rubio to drop out. (Short answer: Nope.) 
daveweigel	706330942244319232	2016-03-06T04:09:54	Cruz wins two states, cable plays a little of it in the side of the screen. Trump wins two states, it all goes live.  Come on.
daveweigel	706328174884462592	2016-03-06T03:58:54	The moment they said would never happen: Rubio's 3-5-2-2-3-2-3-2-3-1-3-3-3-3-2-3-3-3-4 strategy

daveweigel	706326981105881088	2016-03-06T03:54:09	That shot at Rand Paul is uncalled for, given that Paul has studiously avoided the NeverTrump movement.
daveweigel	706319288995602432	2016-03-06T03:23:35	Donald Trump wins the Kentucky Republican Caucus.
daveweigel	706314349011472385	2016-03-06T03:03:58	Based on this, those 450K votes that have already been cast in Florida have to loom large in Cruz's mind. 
daveweigel	706313803017953280	2016-03-06T03:01:47	The biggest counties in northern KY are in; Cruz wanted to win them, and did. It's all about JeffCo, STILL.
daveweigel	706309840159768577	2016-03-06T02:46:03	The weird thing is that Cruz is hitting all the marks he wanted -- except in the South, where Trump absconded with his voters.

daveweigel	706304212616007681	2016-03-06T02:23:41	Cruz wins Boone County, KY, but just 35-30 over Trump. We're still on track for a Trump win unless JeffCo surprises everybody.
daveweigel	706302987812147200	2016-03-06T02:18:49	It shouldn't just be up to SteveKornacki to map where votes are coming from. Just pointing at raw totals is dumb TV.
daveweigel	706302456490229760	2016-03-06T02:16:42	No, independents can register as Republicans on caucus day. But Ds can't become Rs. 
daveweigel	706301944667742208	2016-03-06T02:14:40	Closed primaries are suboptimal for Trump. But he is likely to go 2-1 (KY, LA v KS) in closed contests tonight.
daveweigel	706292328005300225	2016-03-06T01:36:27	Cruz has won Kim Davis's Rowan County by a single vote -- 318 over Trump's 317.

daveweigel	706283778113724416	2016-03-06T01:02:29	From Jefferson County GOP: In 2012, Jefferson County voters cast 26,266 votes in the May primary. Today they cast 34,184
daveweigel	706282905769787393	2016-03-06T00:59:01	Hey CNN -- No need to come out of every commercial break with a "key race alert." I jerk my head up every time expecting a call.
daveweigel	706282082834751488	2016-03-06T00:55:45	Some CNN pundits defending CNN 4 so much Trump coverage. Some truth. But live coverage of so many Trump speeches &amp; not others is inexcusable

daveweigel	706279152291356672	2016-03-06T00:44:06	Cruz campaign in Kentucky tells me they expect JeffCo to go Trump, but they have always been low balling expectations here.
daveweigel	706278694944444417	2016-03-06T00:42:17	We don't know much about kycaucus until JeffCo (Louisville) reports. Trump rallied there, but not the sort of place he typically does well.
daveweigel	706275884525727744	2016-03-06T00:31:07	EsotericCD daveweigel not even close!

daveweigel	706266136296423424	2016-03-05T23:52:23	Who is saying that? It's just true that Cruz's Plan A was dominating the South on March 1 and he didn't.

daveweigel	706233655983804416	2016-03-05T21:43:19	Oddly, Trump has probably moved the Overton Window on this election. Rubio would be a nutter in the '96 field. Makes Cruz look mainstream.
daveweigel	706235837696966656	2016-03-05T21:51:59	Greg Abbott for Cruz, but you gotta think Cruz was on track anyway in TX.

daveweigel	706226475658317824	2016-03-05T21:14:47	GOP establishment now working feverishly to enlist Cruz's field operation, funded by Kasich's donors, to mobilize Trump's voters for Rubio.
daveweigel	706225319494029313	2016-03-05T21:10:11	Ted Cruz has won the Kansas Republican caucus.
daveweigel	706224670324953088	2016-03-05T21:07:37	If Trump had a bad day today and Cruz a good one, will be hard to tell whether its because of caucuses or recent events.
