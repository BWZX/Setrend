speechboy71	722459063649497088	2016-04-19T16:17:18	MJPlitnick Yeah, I don't agree. Anyway, must get back to work!
speechboy71	722458653710819330	2016-04-19T16:15:40	MJPlitnick I don't agree with that. The GOP rhetoric on Isr/Pal is horrible. Cant really compare the two: even if I think she can do better
speechboy71	722458054709616641	2016-04-19T16:13:17	MJPlitnick Right. I'm just a little tired of politicians getting a gold star for stating facts on Isr/Pal &amp; offering little follow through
speechboy71	722457753327939585	2016-04-19T16:12:05	MJPlitnick Merely recognizing that the Palestinians are human beings distinguishes his comments from the GOP
speechboy71	722457464810127360	2016-04-19T16:10:56	MJPlitnick Plus, as you and I know - and as this Administration has proven repeatedly on Isr/Pal - talk is cheap.
speechboy71	722457261772259328	2016-04-19T16:10:08	MJPlitnick I don't know. It's hard for me to get too worked up on this when Biden just directly attacked Bibi
speechboy71	722456510174011392	2016-04-19T16:07:09	MJPlitnick Having said that, I think it's great he said it and he deserves to be commended for it.
speechboy71	722456429630779392	2016-04-19T16:06:50	MJPlitnick But I don't see the campaign trail comments as moving policy that dramatically, when they really just reflect policy
speechboy71	722456321065361409	2016-04-19T16:06:24	MJPlitnick Well he did criticize some Israel policies: 
speechboy71	722455896610238464	2016-04-19T16:04:42	MJPlitnick It is! Obama, Clinton, W have all said the same thing - repeatedly!
speechboy71	722455137801924612	2016-04-19T16:01:42	MJPlitnick If he really wanted to push the envelope, call on US to recognize Pal state, condemn settlements at UN etc
speechboy71	722455011805020161	2016-04-19T16:01:12	MJPlitnick I just think the U.S. position on the conflict will remain largely the same
speechboy71	722454531808894976	2016-04-19T15:59:17	MJPlitnick Not sure I agree. He's not saying anything that's different. That he's saying it is good, but I'm dubious abt the policy impact
speechboy71	722448309936394240	2016-04-19T15:34:34	Agreed! 
speechboy71	722447326632153088	2016-04-19T15:30:39	So while it's great Sanders spoke up for the Palestinian people in the last debate ... his position is completely consistent w/US policy

speechboy71	720839117391593473	2016-04-15T05:00:12	That is bad. But I also don't think that she doesn't care about the Palestinian plight or wouldn't work to end the conflict
speechboy71	720838803674402818	2016-04-15T04:58:57	The reason she doesn't (I suspect) is because she thinks pandering on Israel &amp; ignoring the Palestinians is more politically helpful
speechboy71	720838586539450368	2016-04-15T04:58:06	I feel the need to clarify this tweet. Clinton, like all American politicians when they talk about Israel, should mention the Palestinians

speechboy71	720800372001017856	2016-04-15T02:26:15	Having said that, Clinton's line about "autonomy" for the Palestinians was not good.
speechboy71	720800249250521088	2016-04-15T02:25:45	I actually think that both Sanders and Clinton are right about Gaza.

speechboy71	720794679546134528	2016-04-15T02:03:37	This fracking question sums up the difference btw Clinton &amp; Sanders. He is sloganeering; she's trying to be pragmatic
speechboy71	720794193791160320	2016-04-15T02:01:42	There goes Hillary again, trying to answer a question by pointing out policy complexities and tradeoffs

speechboy71	720791698259996672	2016-04-15T01:51:47	Also, focus on the 94 crime bill is one of the dumber debates in this campaign. Largely irrelevant to criminal justice issues today
speechboy71	720791203361464320	2016-04-15T01:49:49	Haven't all these questions already been asked and answered in earlier debates?
speechboy71	720790956753215488	2016-04-15T01:48:50	Clinton's answer on the crime bill was kind of terrible. She should have just defended the elements of the bill that did help reduce crime
speechboy71	720790428874895360	2016-04-15T01:46:44	Clinton apologizing for consequences that were unintended is like a snazzier version of "mistakes were made"
speechboy71	720789775570087936	2016-04-15T01:44:08	I don't know why Sanders just won't say he's changed his view on guns. Would have put this issue to bed a long time ago
speechboy71	720789221733187584	2016-04-15T01:41:56	On guns, Sanders suddenly becomes Mr. Nuance. On every other issue, it's black and white
speechboy71	720789101885173761	2016-04-15T01:41:28	Sanders might have a point on shielding gun sellers, but how do you square that position w/his call for prosecuting bankers?

speechboy71	720788238340853760	2016-04-15T01:38:02	Sanders on guns is so utterly incongruous with every other part of his political message
speechboy71	720788034451599361	2016-04-15T01:37:13	Sanders has been getting asked about the gun issue for, what, 8 months. He still has no good answer
speechboy71	720787677260460036	2016-04-15T01:35:48	Sanders finger is dying to get back into the debate
speechboy71	720787462960844800	2016-04-15T01:34:57	Why is Sanders laughing? Honestly, it just makes him look callous on the gun issue
speechboy71	720787330584485888	2016-04-15T01:34:25	Clinton: "It's not a laughing matter on guns" ... that one stung

speechboy71	720784620611051520	2016-04-15T01:23:39	Why is Sanders so resistant to releasing his tax returns? I don't get it
speechboy71	720784198861266944	2016-04-15T01:21:59	No voters actually care about Clinton's speech transcripts or Sanders tax returns
speechboy71	720783794190565376	2016-04-15T01:20:22	Clinton: I'm not saying Bernie Sanders did something untoward .... actually I'm pretty sure that's what she was saying

speechboy71	718472988669161472	2016-04-08T16:18:03	As a regular subway rider you eventually get the "swipe" down pretty well; shows her rustiness. But it still happens pretty regularly

speechboy71	717725186221547520	2016-04-06T14:46:33	MJPlitnick And you're seeing in this campaign how it's hard for candidates to satisfy both party constituencies
speechboy71	717725044479229953	2016-04-06T14:45:59	MJPlitnick To a large degree, Democrats faltered when they got away from an economic justice agenda, particularly in the 70s &amp; 80s
speechboy71	717724902346866689	2016-04-06T14:45:26	MJPlitnick Agreed. I do think however this econ/social justice is interesting. It's something that's been an issue for Dems for a long time

speechboy71	717723180320886784	2016-04-06T14:38:35	MJPlitnick Ok, then I misunderstood you. Apologies!
speechboy71	717722778493919232	2016-04-06T14:36:59	MJPlitnick Considering that Clinton has beaten Sanders in every state among Dem voters id say she has stronger grassroots support
speechboy71	717722592073924608	2016-04-06T14:36:15	MJPlitnick But you're suggesting that minority voters aren't the grassroots if the party.
speechboy71	717722465053634561	2016-04-06T14:35:44	There certainly is broader support for HRC among party elites, but voter support is something else  
speechboy71	717722312787763200	2016-04-06T14:35:08	Minority voters are party elites?  
speechboy71	717718471501615104	2016-04-06T14:19:52	Your initial comment only makes sense w/more economically conservative voters. That's small segment of her support  
speechboy71	717717979920744448	2016-04-06T14:17:55	The people voting for Clinton are traditionally more focused on social justice. So how is that not her wing? 
speechboy71	717717830049873924	2016-04-06T14:17:19	Actually it exactly makes it so  
speechboy71	717717355690860545	2016-04-06T14:15:26	So would many of the women voting for Clinton 
speechboy71	717717155349938176	2016-04-06T14:14:39	I think the non-white voters casting a ballot for Clinton would disagree pretty strenuously  
speechboy71	717714505690652672	2016-04-06T14:04:07	NATO might be one of the best deals around for US national security. You'd think Trump would get that.  speechboy71
speechboy71	717714338560217088	2016-04-06T14:03:27	One irony of this is that it was Bill Clinton in 92 who moved Dems away from a focus on social justice toward economic justice
speechboy71	717714123119833088	2016-04-06T14:02:36	Not disagreeing. Just saying that's where the divide has been  
speechboy71	717713621409742849	2016-04-06T14:00:36	BenKrimmel Definitely. But that was happening well before this election
speechboy71	717713360620486656	2016-04-06T13:59:34	It is, but for a long time party has been divided over which to prioritize  
speechboy71	717712622393638912	2016-04-06T13:56:38	The real divide is between those focused on economic justice &amp; those focused on social justice

speechboy71	717516760983928833	2016-04-06T00:58:21	There's a rationale for this position. Just not one that's consistent with Sanders' worldview. 
speechboy71	717478157239058432	2016-04-05T22:24:57	My latest for GlobeOpinion: stop blaming the media for Trump. They've done a great job!

speechboy71	717215792878784513	2016-04-05T05:02:24	It's incoherent &amp; suggests he has no understanding of how the drone war is waged

speechboy71	717182036893630464	2016-04-05T02:48:16	For me reading this interview is shocking. I know Sanders talks in platitudes, but he seems to think in them too.
speechboy71	717180862136246272	2016-04-05T02:43:36	It's also evident that he is not conversant on any issue outside of income inequality &amp; even there he just regurgitates his talking points
speechboy71	717180261021167616	2016-04-05T02:41:13	What comes across is a man who has a completely unsophisticated understanding of even the issues that are at the heart of his campaign
speechboy71	717180040438497280	2016-04-05T02:40:20	When you read this it feels like Sanders developed his worldview decades ago and never bothered to update or scrutinize it
speechboy71	717178810995712001	2016-04-05T02:35:27	This actually might be more embarrassing 
speechboy71	717177997653098497	2016-04-05T02:32:13	Sanders answer on drones is just embarrassing 
speechboy71	717177286416605185	2016-04-05T02:29:24	On foreign policy, he talks in platitudes about Israel, but when challenged falls back on the line "I can't tell Israel what to do"
speechboy71	717177127305654272	2016-04-05T02:28:46	He says Wall Street’s biz model is based on fraud &amp; then uses an example of bad biz practice by sub-prime mortgage companies
speechboy71	717177062566596612	2016-04-05T02:28:30	I seriously doubt he could tell you how banks have responded to the crash &amp; Dodd-Frank, in general
speechboy71	717176956136108032	2016-04-05T02:28:05	His understanding of what banks do seems to be based SOLELY on everything they did before the crash.
speechboy71	717176829833048064	2016-04-05T02:27:35	He doesn’t seem to understand mechanisms that exist, as part of Dodd-Frank, to break up banks, even though he talks abt this all the time
speechboy71	717176717270466560	2016-04-05T02:27:08	And there's more! He says Apple isnt a bad actor, but then says GE is, because they avoid taxes &amp; take jobs overseas, which Apple also does!
speechboy71	717176561296883712	2016-04-05T02:26:31	He has the most simplistic understanding of trade. He seems to think wages are the ONLY consideration when companies move ops overseas
speechboy71	717176350344421376	2016-04-05T02:25:41	The best he comes up won trade (as far as I can tell) is to suggest developing countries should pay their workers similar wage as US workers
speechboy71	717176032353193984	2016-04-05T02:24:25	On trade, he says we need fair trade &amp; must to re-negotiate trade pacts. Offers almost no insight into what that means.
speechboy71	717175845928976384	2016-04-05T02:23:40	On education, he says early childhood education is imp; teachers aren’t paid enough. Offers no clue on what he’d do about that.
speechboy71	717175726022246400	2016-04-05T02:23:12	What’s most revelatory is that Sanders answers every question by diagnosing the problem &amp; offers practically no policy solution
speechboy71	717175557096673280	2016-04-05T02:22:31	The NYDailyNews interview w/Sander is a revelatory moment. It shows that he doesn't know what he's talking about

speechboy71	716598042808467456	2016-04-03T12:07:41	In reading this nytimes article on Trump's poll numbers it's just remarkable anyone though Trump could have won: 
speechboy71	716390261899845632	2016-04-02T22:22:02	This seems unwise  
speechboy71	716386366192545792	2016-04-02T22:06:34	Think she also said this in Apollo speech this week.  
speechboy71	716365609068572672	2016-04-02T20:44:05	JamesFallows Ordinarily I wouldn't think it's an issue, but Sanders doesn't have same loyalty to Dem party as BHO &amp; HRC.
speechboy71	716364121382510593	2016-04-02T20:38:10	JamesFallows But at this point I bow to the Twitter masses in concluding I'm probably wrong!
speechboy71	716364027224530944	2016-04-02T20:37:48	JamesFallows Well I didn't say more bitter. Just said it felt more personal &amp; more focused on character
speechboy71	716363843077799936	2016-04-02T20:37:04	Ok but that's not raising questions about character &amp; integrity. It goes to temperament. That's pretty mild stuff

speechboy71	716362666776915968	2016-04-02T20:32:23	DavidKlion I literally just wrote that in a tweet! Completely agree
speechboy71	716362530675957761	2016-04-02T20:31:51	FWIW another key diff w/08 is that BHO/HRC was primarily about personality. This year, it's ideology. Latter attacks are more delegitimizing
speechboy71	716361758752026624	2016-04-02T20:28:47	DavidKlion Isn't the opposite true? Relative to his ability to win, Sanders attacks seem harsher and more personal

speechboy71	716341318146998272	2016-04-02T19:07:33	Yes. I took care of them

speechboy71	716338038314573824	2016-04-02T18:54:31	Well not all are, I agree.  Read the piece:  
speechboy71	716336746334720000	2016-04-02T18:49:23	And they are hard to justify at point when it's nearly impossible for him to win 
speechboy71	716336520458858496	2016-04-02T18:48:30	Never said they weren't. They contradict his pledge not to personally attack on character 
speechboy71	716336070628151298	2016-04-02T18:46:42	Key diff is in 08, main issues were experience, ability to affect change etc. Now personal integrity more in the mix 
speechboy71	716334911452528640	2016-04-02T18:42:06	Yes. There's an ideological element to this campaign that feels more personal in its tone 
speechboy71	716333550371475457	2016-04-02T18:36:41	Sure. But a completely legitimate line of argument for a presidential campaign  
speechboy71	716332073842307073	2016-04-02T18:30:49	Like always! 
speechboy71	716330134123520000	2016-04-02T18:23:07	.jonfavs speechboy71 From covering it, I say the bad blood in 2008 was much worse. (Particularly in Massachusetts.)
speechboy71	716328904974147584	2016-04-02T18:18:14	I was there, 2008 was worse - on both sides. But look, now we're all friends! Except you, Mark Penn. You're bad.

speechboy71	716328399531294720	2016-04-02T18:16:13	Which means I'm probably wrong!
speechboy71	716327889856233472	2016-04-02T18:14:12	JamesFallows But it's evident I'm in the minority on this one!
speechboy71	716327816325951488	2016-04-02T18:13:54	JamesFallows FWIW, I think calling BHO a lightweight is not an overly personal attack. BS going after HRC's personal integrity feels worse
speechboy71	716324906707861506	2016-04-02T18:02:21	Right but nothing about that 3:00 AM was nasty. That's a legit attack on his lack of experience  
speechboy71	716324265642082304	2016-04-02T17:59:48	But that's just ghoulish, not really a personal attack

speechboy71	716320169040220160	2016-04-02T17:43:31	Yeah, ok, that's pretty bad 
speechboy71	716319154974752768	2016-04-02T17:39:29	dhnexon Quite possible. Also could be eye of beholder.
speechboy71	716318624584044544	2016-04-02T17:37:23	dhnexon Should also add that I have no real issue w/ legitimacy of Sanders attacks.
speechboy71	716318362561679360	2016-04-02T17:36:20	dhnexon To be clear, my sense is that Sanders critiques are more personal/character focused. But could be faulty memory

speechboy71	716314163681828864	2016-04-02T17:19:39	Interesting. What was the tenor of the attacks? 
speechboy71	716309546034143233	2016-04-02T17:01:18	blakehounshell Like I said, feels nastier than 08. Compared to the GOP race it's pretty mild

speechboy71	714518957617770498	2016-03-28T18:26:09	Somehow this is NOT parody:  
speechboy71	714518165590564864	2016-03-28T18:23:00	So much praise to Adrian_Walker for this piece on how and why he quit drinking: 
speechboy71	714514078300049409	2016-03-28T18:06:45	robneyer Ah yes. That people will read it in the worst possible light is a given!
speechboy71	714502894813331457	2016-03-28T17:22:19	robneyer Or she should just debate him, since she already agreed to do so
speechboy71	714502599488221184	2016-03-28T17:21:09	robneyer Not so sure. Frontrunners never want to debate. Her campaign should come up w/a better reason why she doesn't want to
speechboy71	714501974473973761	2016-03-28T17:18:40	Ironically, this is a good explanation of how $ works in politic. Goes to those who generally share donor's views   
speechboy71	714501302219358208	2016-03-28T17:15:59	I get Clinton doesn't want more debates, but saying she won't cuz Sanders is being mean is a decidedly lame reason: 
speechboy71	714497116861804546	2016-03-28T16:59:22	Not me. I love them already! 
speechboy71	714490574380904452	2016-03-28T16:33:22	Slow clap ... 
speechboy71	714424443246886913	2016-03-28T12:10:35	Congratulations to JamesTraub1 on the publication of his new John Quincy Adams biography!  
speechboy71	714423680076529664	2016-03-28T12:07:33	This is a very important read from nickconfessore on how the GOP lost touch with its voters 
speechboy71	714212693117444097	2016-03-27T22:09:10	This is such an indictment of cable news. 
speechboy71	714198347188449280	2016-03-27T21:12:09	Area Presidential Candidate Is Quite a Narcissist 
speechboy71	714174037757411328	2016-03-27T19:35:33	ChrisCaesar Not really. More evidence that it buys access.
speechboy71	714170288133566464	2016-03-27T19:20:39	ChrisCaesar You should ask them! I'm questioning notion that contributions have direct impact on political decision-making
speechboy71	714140878877679617	2016-03-27T17:23:48	maggieNYT Ah. I'd be curious to see the evidence for that argument
speechboy71	714138714117644288	2016-03-27T17:15:12	speechboy71 Aw, people change all the time when they realize they're close to the prize.
speechboy71	714137872459296768	2016-03-27T17:11:51	Also worth noting that Clinton lodged similar negative attacks against Obama in 08 &amp; was rightly criticized for it
speechboy71	714137494216957954	2016-03-27T17:10:21	The suggestion that Clinton opposes the reforms that Sanders supports because of campaign contributions is very much a personal attack
speechboy71	714136723631042562	2016-03-27T17:07:17	maggieNYT Did she go first? Does seem like his suggestion she's personally corrupted is beyond anything HRC has said about him
speechboy71	714136000046448641	2016-03-27T17:04:25	To be sure, there's nothing wrong with negative attacks from Sanders - but not when you'd earlier said you weren't going to go there
speechboy71	714135549431386112	2016-03-27T17:02:37	nickdimorohere I had kind of enjoyed your Sanders boosterism, though a bit obnoxious ... but call me a hack and you get blocked. Bye-bye
speechboy71	714135082504699904	2016-03-27T17:00:46	For Sanders to be attacking Clinton personally when he has almost no chance of winning will be a sad bookmark to his campaign
speechboy71	714134245590097920	2016-03-27T16:57:26	It's a good example of how the pressure of running for POTUS &amp; believing you can win, can negatively affect a politician
speechboy71	714133899115380736	2016-03-27T16:56:04	Important piece on how Sanders has contradicted his own pledge not to run a negative campaign against Clinton: 
speechboy71	714127742489460736	2016-03-27T16:31:36	Horrific.  
speechboy71	714101404625973248	2016-03-27T14:46:56	So this actually counts as progress this year

speechboy71	713915427437543424	2016-03-27T02:27:56	Yes! 
speechboy71	713909118411649024	2016-03-27T02:02:52	Yes exactly. It's the definition of what it means to be a foreign policy hawk  
speechboy71	713908543359942656	2016-03-27T02:00:35	This Mattis piece is poor punditry. Present unrealistic scenario that won't happen. Get RTs for being provocative:  
speechboy71	713907705577127936	2016-03-27T01:57:15	Again, none of this is necessarily an endorsement of her foreign policy views ... but compared to Republicans, Clinton's a dove!
speechboy71	713907383697805312	2016-03-27T01:55:58	Also pretty much every Republican has advocated committing war crimes. That makes them slightly more hawkish than Clinton
speechboy71	713906988204339200	2016-03-27T01:54:24	On Iran every Republican opposed nuke deal and Clinton supported. That alone makes her less of a hawk
speechboy71	713906677398048773	2016-03-27T01:53:10	Good point. I'm curious who jaketapper had in mind with this 
speechboy71	713906469419294720	2016-03-27T01:52:20	One can think Clinton is too solicitous of the use of force; too inclined to "do something" etc .. but she's not as hawkish as top GOPers
speechboy71	713905971756670977	2016-03-27T01:50:22	Guy who wants to slap 35% tariffs on trading partners; torture; invade countries &amp; steal oil ... is a hawk 
speechboy71	713904462222475264	2016-03-27T01:44:22	To be clear, I'm agreeing with Jeet! The notion that Clinton is more hawkish than Republicans is bizarre  
speechboy71	713903701358952448	2016-03-27T01:41:20	Not even remotely accurate

speechboy71	713803694446391296	2016-03-26T19:03:57	US is maintaining long term military presence in Afghanistan - that's a poor example. As for Asia, no 
speechboy71	713802893971886081	2016-03-26T19:00:46	Where has Obama decreased US military presence &amp; influence? Certainly not in Asia or Europe 
speechboy71	713802343049859072	2016-03-26T18:58:35	I don't think Obama believes that at all!  
speechboy71	713802018972962816	2016-03-26T18:57:17	Trump is talking about pulling out of NATO, ending US alliances. Obama agrees w/none of that  
speechboy71	713801842929627140	2016-03-26T18:56:35	By that definition, how can you argue that Obama &amp; Trump are similar! 
speechboy71	713800524680851456	2016-03-26T18:51:21	Um it's also projecting. Certainly support for NATO allies is projecting; same too w/Asian allies  
speechboy71	713800246288125953	2016-03-26T18:50:15	Outlook on US power and role of allies is not same at all!  
speechboy71	713799843882393600	2016-03-26T18:48:39	He's fighting a war in Iraq/Syria; Afghanistan, drone strikes, military support along NATO's eastern border 
speechboy71	713799284215390208	2016-03-26T18:46:25	I'm aware. He's not suggesting leaving NATO or ending US Japan treaty!

speechboy71	713798563592073216	2016-03-26T18:43:33	Obama doesn't believe in projecting US power? 
speechboy71	713798329860276225	2016-03-26T18:42:38	Except US is taking lead against ISIS &amp; not asking others to pay for it! 
speechboy71	713797746621345792	2016-03-26T18:40:19	Real leverage? Trump wants to force other countries to pay US protection. That bears no similarity to Obama's views 
speechboy71	713795872400740352	2016-03-26T18:32:52	This is like saying Ted Cruz and Obama have the same foreign policy because they both want to defeat ISIS

speechboy71	710969964954574848	2016-03-18T23:23:43	Freedom of the press is a first amendment issue. Any time a news outlet is sued it's a 1st Amndt issue

speechboy71	710932403703963648	2016-03-18T20:54:28	And yet ... he has not 
speechboy71	710932221004218369	2016-03-18T20:53:44	Sanders has not given a single major foreign policy speech &amp; is now skipping AIPAC. Hard to be a serious POTUS candidate when you do that
speechboy71	710932110572449793	2016-03-18T20:53:18	Yes 
speechboy71	710931433188167684	2016-03-18T20:50:36	If Bernie Sanders can speak at Liberty University he can handle AIPAC
speechboy71	710931112755916800	2016-03-18T20:49:20	Because how a US president would handle a key bilateral relationship is a serious issue  
speechboy71	710930861026320384	2016-03-18T20:48:20	Yes that should've been skipping

speechboy71	708490052343570433	2016-03-12T03:09:26	maggieNYT Nice. Close, but we went with American Maelstrom: 
speechboy71	708487231137325056	2016-03-12T02:58:13	The definition of gutless 
speechboy71	708484341903564800	2016-03-12T02:46:44	sizzling

speechboy71	708465068321710080	2016-03-12T01:30:09	DougSaunders Awesome! Hope you enjoy it
speechboy71	708464270925799430	2016-03-12T01:26:59	That was around the same time that Wallace, at a rally in New Mexico, was booed by schoolchildren 
speechboy71	708462921089732608	2016-03-12T01:21:37	In light of my tweets tonight I'm contractually obligated to mention my book on 1968 is available for pre-order: 
speechboy71	708462397120503808	2016-03-12T01:19:32	But in 68, the violence at Wallace events in the fall hurt him politically  
speechboy71	708462214328553473	2016-03-12T01:18:49	He was just behind HHH in September 
speechboy71	708461744390344705	2016-03-12T01:16:57	bendwilliams I'm not either. His support is restricted to the GOP
speechboy71	708461578052620288	2016-03-12T01:16:17	dougporter506 was that in October? By that point Wallace was being heckled mercilessly
speechboy71	708461383659159552	2016-03-12T01:15:31	Wallace got 13% of the national vote in 1968, mostly in the South. Trump's support is broader &amp; national (within the GOP)
speechboy71	708461022219268096	2016-03-12T01:14:04	bendwilliams I mean that today's GOP is more radicalized than Wallace's supporters
speechboy71	708460481409916928	2016-03-12T01:11:55	Yes, the nomination 
speechboy71	708460072096165888	2016-03-12T01:10:18	This whole Trump phenomon is a stealth marketing campaign for speechboy71's book: 
speechboy71	708460248667922432	2016-03-12T01:11:00	This ain't 1968 ...  
speechboy71	708459644407193603	2016-03-12T01:08:36	He talked about running over protesters with the presidential limo 
speechboy71	708459405050847232	2016-03-12T01:07:39	Wallace cultivated this sense of anarchy and protest ... Trump is doing the same. This will help him politically
speechboy71	708458766056951808	2016-03-12T01:05:07	Some context on 1968: what happened tonight at the Trump event happened on an almost daily basis at Wallace events in 1968
speechboy71	708458544413216768	2016-03-12T01:04:14	FYI:  
speechboy71	708454619647746048	2016-03-12T00:48:38	You think this is bad. Imagine a fall campaign with Trump as the nominee
speechboy71	708454020202020865	2016-03-12T00:46:15	Riots in Chicago at a political event ... ok I take it all back maggieNYT
speechboy71	708450341768044544	2016-03-12T00:31:38	I highly recommend thegarance's timeline for a fascinating perspective on Clinton's foolish comment today praising Nancy Reagan on HIV/AIDS
speechboy71	708417531896274944	2016-03-11T22:21:16	For  commute home, marcambinder has a great new podcast, w/a great discussion this week of a contested convention 
speechboy71	708416275064737792	2016-03-11T22:16:16	morgan_joel Right and this myth developed that the Iranians had released them because they were afraid of Reagan. Absolute crap
speechboy71	708415929147920386	2016-03-11T22:14:53	morgan_joel Right and the Iranians delayed the hostages release to stick it to Carter
speechboy71	708413837091979264	2016-03-11T22:06:35	morgan_joel Not off the top of my head, but tons written on this. Reagan had nothing to do with the hostage release
speechboy71	708412473192407041	2016-03-11T22:01:09	Clinton like many other humans misspoke, said something wrong and apologized, as she should have. But ... hottakes
speechboy71	708412143482314752	2016-03-11T21:59:51	Yesterday, Cruz repeated an absolutely false claim  Iran released the hostages because they were afraid of Reagan. It's a lie. Nobody cares
speechboy71	708411868931624961	2016-03-11T21:58:45	She said something wrong that is widely held myth about Nancy Reagan. She apologized! But no, let's go deeper. What does this say about her?
speechboy71	708411680208855043	2016-03-11T21:58:00	I see from my TL that we've entered my favorite part of  Clinton gaffe coverage: why does she hate progressives? why is she so calculating?
speechboy71	708401289722535941	2016-03-11T21:16:43	She was at her funeral! She said something nice about NR that many people, including her son, think is true of her. 
speechboy71	708400772858433536	2016-03-11T21:14:40	In fact, here's  Reagan Jr. saying  his mother pushed Reagan to focus on the AIDS issue. This is a pervasive myth: 
speechboy71	708399713893097473	2016-03-11T21:10:27	She she said something silly and uninformed. She should apologize &amp; the world will go on.
speechboy71	708399574357053440	2016-03-11T21:09:54	Having said all this, it strikes me as fairly silly to suggest that she said this on purpose or for political reasons. Why?
speechboy71	708395106638888960	2016-03-11T20:52:09	I worked in AIDS clinics..Ronnie never let the word cross his lips 
speechboy71	708395464371081219	2016-03-11T20:53:34	Oddly one of the most pervasive myths about Reagan is that he helped end the Cold War by being firm - in fact he did it by being flexible
speechboy71	708394184151928832	2016-03-11T20:48:29	speechboy71 I am disappointed by Clinton's comments, as should all members of the LGBT community. NR/RR never fighters for LGBTers.
speechboy71	708394245560864768	2016-03-11T20:48:44	Will Bunch has written an excellent book about the Reagan mythology - it's so pervasive, even Democrats spout it Will_Bunch
speechboy71	708393590066683904	2016-03-11T20:46:07	There's so much absurd myth making around the Reagans, like the Iranian hostages were freed cuz of him - something Ted Cruz said last night
speechboy71	708392844004732928	2016-03-11T20:43:09	And HRC should apologize ... and while she's at it, maybe watch "How To Survive A Plague"
speechboy71	708392647740645376	2016-03-11T20:42:23	If anything, Nancy Reagan's lack of attention to the AIDS crisis, even when her friend Rock Hudson was sick, should weigh on her legacy
speechboy71	708392404420661248	2016-03-11T20:41:25	But this a major myth abt NR. For ex: "It was Nancy Reagan who helped open her husband’s eyes to the AIDS epidemic" 
speechboy71	708391631175573504	2016-03-11T20:38:20	Considering her broad support within the LGBT community, Clinton should really know better.
speechboy71	708391334319554560	2016-03-11T20:37:10	In reality, the Reagan Administration did nothing, even blocked efforts, to deal with the HIV/AIDS crisis &amp; Nancy herself was no advocate
speechboy71	708391125980041216	2016-03-11T20:36:20	Doubly depressing abt Clinton's comments is how pervasive this myth is that Nancy Reagan encouraged her husband to speak out on AIDS ..
speechboy71	708373267820748800	2016-03-11T19:25:22	He seems nice 
speechboy71	708371758420795392	2016-03-11T19:19:22	Right. Isn't it "started a conversation after years of doing nothing &amp; many people died"

speechboy71	708319196158009346	2016-03-11T15:50:30	"Sucker Punch" would be a pretty good title for a book on the entire Trump campaign.
speechboy71	708338997785927680	2016-03-11T17:09:12	This is a good rejoinder to the pearl clutching about Trump's general election potential 
speechboy71	708333863412572160	2016-03-11T16:48:47	This is really quite something 
speechboy71	708313341081550848	2016-03-11T15:27:14	Well this is terrifying 
speechboy71	708160979847159810	2016-03-11T05:21:49	Seriously is there anything an "analyst" can say that would cause CNN to say "maybe we shouldn't be giving this person a platform"
speechboy71	708159831266308096	2016-03-11T05:17:15	Earlier today Andy Dean praised a man at a Trump rally who sucker punched someone &amp; now he's offering analysis of the debate. Good work CNN
speechboy71	708149005402939392	2016-03-11T04:34:14	In January, Trump denied saying he'd impose a 45% tariff on China.  Tonight: "The 45% tax is a threat." cc: maggieNYT
speechboy71	708142558615113729	2016-03-11T04:08:37	Anderson Cooper just called this debate "very substantive," which makes me think that he took a nap during the debate
speechboy71	708141481492615169	2016-03-11T04:04:20	Everything about that debate was awful and an insult to honesty, decency and democracy
speechboy71	708141073575624704	2016-03-11T04:02:43	The one defining characteristic of Trump supporters is that they DON'T love the Republican Party
speechboy71	708140641469997056	2016-03-11T04:01:00	You know who else cant wait to be on a debate stage with Ted Cruz ... Hillary Clinton
speechboy71	708140476063469569	2016-03-11T04:00:20	Cruz should have said "the son of a slumlord"
speechboy71	708140250816712705	2016-03-11T03:59:27	Rubio: My parents never wanted me to go into politics ... maybe you should have listened to them

speechboy71	708138308275200000	2016-03-11T03:51:43	I think you mean "full of idiots" 
speechboy71	708137939038027776	2016-03-11T03:50:15	Rubio wants credit for talking about student loans ... notice he doesn't mention what he would do about student loans

speechboy71	708136930379231232	2016-03-11T03:46:15	If Rubio had a heart, he'd tell him to go inside 
speechboy71	708136697599533057	2016-03-11T03:45:19	This Rubio story is not going to end well
speechboy71	708136502421749760	2016-03-11T03:44:33	Cruz: If Trump is the nominee, Hillary is going to win. But if I'm the nominee ... oh yeah, she'll win. Who am I kidding
speechboy71	708135506400452608	2016-03-11T03:40:35	So not one of Trump's rivals was willing to condemn the violence at his rallies ... and people wonder why they're losing
speechboy71	708135301823262720	2016-03-11T03:39:47	Rubio's answer to violence at Trump rallies ... America can do anything
speechboy71	708135140334166017	2016-03-11T03:39:08	Rubio: "the first people facing violence in America are police officers" ... I give up
speechboy71	708134975942619137	2016-03-11T03:38:29	So when asked about violence at Trump rallies, both Kasich and Cruz have said that people are angry &amp; Obama is breaking the law
speechboy71	708134759411687424	2016-03-11T03:37:37	Pretty much 
speechboy71	708134575571132416	2016-03-11T03:36:53	You know who else laughed at large rallies?
speechboy71	708134220095475712	2016-03-11T03:35:29	Cruz: We don't need violence ... but the president of the United States is breaking the law every day

speechboy71	708132661336875010	2016-03-11T03:29:17	Everything said in the last 20 minutes of this debate should disqualify each of these four men from ever becoming president
speechboy71	708132412417515522	2016-03-11T03:28:18	In 1990 he praised the Chinese govt response to Tiananmen 
speechboy71	708131581286813696	2016-03-11T03:25:00	And now Ted Cruz is peddling the fiction that Iran freed the hostages because Reagan was elected. MAKE IT STOP

speechboy71	708130928011452417	2016-03-11T03:22:24	Everything about Marco Rubio's answer on climate change makes me want to tear my TV off the wall and hurl it out the window
speechboy71	708130661375336448	2016-03-11T03:21:20	Marco Rubio wants to be president of the United States and he refuses to acknowledge that climate change is a real thing
speechboy71	708130387881500672	2016-03-11T03:20:15	Rubio: “Sure the climate is changing, it has always changed. Winter becomes spring, spring becomes summer…"
speechboy71	708130406957248513	2016-03-11T03:20:20	Kasich stoops to pandering on foreign policy. Rubio parrots climate change deniers. These are the reasonable ones!
speechboy71	708130394554638337	2016-03-11T03:20:17	Rubio saying we can't pass a law that will change the weather ... FFS

speechboy71	708128210064695296	2016-03-11T03:11:36	Donald Trump is channelling his inner Ben Carson tonight. He sounds demonstrably more incoherent than usual
speechboy71	708127903645634562	2016-03-11T03:10:23	I wrote before Rubio was sounding sane. Strike that
speechboy71	708127448253263872	2016-03-11T03:08:34	This.  
speechboy71	708127286286032896	2016-03-11T03:07:56	You honestly can't do justice to the sheer stupidity of this foreign policy discussion.
speechboy71	708126740607066113	2016-03-11T03:05:45	Watching these candidates discuss military operations makes me physically ill.

speechboy71	708126423907704832	2016-03-11T03:04:30	When John Kasich says he was in the Pentagon after 9/11, I'm pretty sure that he means as a visitor
speechboy71	708126234086121472	2016-03-11T03:03:45	Make no mistake: whenTed Cruz complains about restrictive rules of engagement he is advocating war crimes
speechboy71	708125922558406656	2016-03-11T03:02:30	Kasich boldly comes out against peace in the Middle East
speechboy71	708125943466950656	2016-03-11T03:02:35	So now John Kasich thinks there's no hope for a long-term peace settlement btw Israelis &amp; Arabs ... and he's the moderate
speechboy71	708125614377664513	2016-03-11T03:01:17	Rubio would break from modern US policy history by openly opposing a negotiated settlement between Israel and Palestinians.
speechboy71	708125628562853888	2016-03-11T03:01:20	Trump is now being criticized because he won't put Israel's nat'l sec interests ahead of America's
speechboy71	708124781367988224	2016-03-11T02:57:58	Ted Cruz just equated all Palestinians with terrorists.
speechboy71	708125353626230784	2016-03-11T03:00:15	The Israel section of this debate is ... not good
speechboy71	708125038298406913	2016-03-11T02:59:00	Ted Cruz: We need a president who understand America's nat'l sec interests ... next breath: we should support Israel no matter what it does

speechboy71	708124169960091648	2016-03-11T02:55:33	Jake Tapper asking if we will kill the families of terrorists. That is literally the definition of the soft bigotry of low expectations

speechboy71	707432300196315137	2016-03-09T05:06:18	Tonight's result is a great example of how deeply reliant Sanders is on the youth vote &amp; conversely how reliant Clinton is on the black vote

speechboy71	707427016681897984	2016-03-09T04:45:18	For those of you want to chalk Sanders win up to NAFTA, the real reason was youth support ... i.e people who weren't alive when NAFTA passed

speechboy71	707403935523414017	2016-03-09T03:13:35	Based on the current vote tally and what's still out, looks like Clinton will pull this out, but much closer than anyone might have imagined

speechboy71	707399662299316224	2016-03-09T02:56:36	Having said that, Clinton still almost certain to be the nominee, but this result has to be sobering for her campaign
speechboy71	707399402047062018	2016-03-09T02:55:34	But even if Clinton narrowly pulls this out, pretty lousy outcome for her. She had a double digit lead in the polls

speechboy71	706663785151467520	2016-03-07T02:12:30	Sanders: I want to tell you a story ... is like the dialogue of every Passover Seder I've ever been to
speechboy71	706663507484352512	2016-03-07T02:11:24	Clinton saying she wants white Americans to understand the experience of black Americans is a remarkable statement
speechboy71	706662451014668288	2016-03-07T02:07:12	ThePlumLineGS True…but that also holds for the auto bailout, TPP, lots of bills…
speechboy71	706662790312894465	2016-03-07T02:08:33	Shorter Hillary Clinton: Don Lemon's question is one I don't want to answer
speechboy71	706662637929697281	2016-03-07T02:07:56	This answer from Sanders on how he understands other cultures sounds a bit patronizing
speechboy71	706661557896351745	2016-03-07T02:03:39	This 
speechboy71	706661111748136961	2016-03-07T02:01:52	So weird that Sanders is so protective of gun sellers&amp;the gun industry, when he's protective of no other industry! 
speechboy71	706661205138604033	2016-03-07T02:02:15	To hear Sanders say he wants to protect gun manufacturing jobs is really quite something
speechboy71	706661014008365056	2016-03-07T02:01:29	Sanders is the most black and white candidate ... except when it comes to guns. The disconnect is really extraordinary
speechboy71	706660707127959552	2016-03-07T02:00:16	Clinton is just burying Sanders tonight on the gun issue.
speechboy71	706660161943896065	2016-03-07T01:58:06	Why does Sanders always point to Anderson when he wants to talk? Who the hell else is going to be called on?
speechboy71	706659906510823424	2016-03-07T01:57:05	I find it kind of remarkable that Sanders still has no good answer on the gun question
speechboy71	706652885283569664	2016-03-07T01:29:11	speechboy71 everyone around me cringed. Played terribly in the building.
speechboy71	706658889278865408	2016-03-07T01:53:02	joshgreenman Just saying that what Sanders did is the kind of thing that women put up with all the time in a way that men simply don't
speechboy71	706658505319702528	2016-03-07T01:51:31	joshgreenman Well I don't think you can ignore gender disparities
speechboy71	706658292135636992	2016-03-07T01:50:40	Yes to this question. Talking about mental health is a dodge when it comes to the issue of guns
speechboy71	706658205817028608	2016-03-07T01:50:19	joshgreenman Theoretically that's true. But in reality, this plays badly

speechboy71	706657125188108288	2016-03-07T01:46:02	Sanders has the most scarily simplistic understanding of economics. If anything benefits a corporation - even to create jobs - he's opposed
speechboy71	706656540732874752	2016-03-07T01:43:43	Anderson Cooper should ask him why car companies deserve bailouts but a plane manufacturing company shouldn't get loan guarantees.
speechboy71	706656614011502593	2016-03-07T01:44:00	Does Sanders understand that when Boeing builds planes in America it creates jobs in America - and good paying ones at that
speechboy71	706656406615801857	2016-03-07T01:43:11	This Boeing answer is not great politically, but really does show the amazing depth of her policy knowledge
speechboy71	706656136259313664	2016-03-07T01:42:06	To rephrase this, he wants Americans to pay more for cars and in the process subsidize US car companies
speechboy71	706655815869046784	2016-03-07T01:40:50	Seems worth nothing that this led to the greatest reduction in global poverty in human history 
speechboy71	706655635207753728	2016-03-07T01:40:07	Bernie Sanders doesn't want taxpayers to subsidize corporations ... he wants subsidies to pay more for cars &amp; subsidize US car companies
speechboy71	706655391229329409	2016-03-07T01:39:08	Honestly, Sanders needs to modulate his voice. It's grating to listen to him yelling ALL THE TIME
speechboy71	706655292843532288	2016-03-07T01:38:45	This X1000

speechboy71	706654622300168192	2016-03-07T01:36:05	That Sanders tweet blaming trade policies for Detroit's decline is just grade A horseshit
speechboy71	706653915694166017	2016-03-07T01:33:17	You get the sense that these two increasingly don't like each other. Lot of tension between on stage tonight
speechboy71	706653544472903680	2016-03-07T01:31:48	Getting billionaires to bail out financial/auto sector in the middle of the crisis on a tight schedule is some House of Cards level thinking
speechboy71	706653393352335361	2016-03-07T01:31:12	Exactly 
speechboy71	706653047703937025	2016-03-07T01:29:50	Sanders answer on the auto bailout didn't actually answer the question of whether he opposed the auto bailout
speechboy71	706652650243280896	2016-03-07T01:28:15	"Excuse me I'm talking" ... every woman in America cringed at that one
speechboy71	706652474258673664	2016-03-07T01:27:33	Sanders bragging about voting against the Wall Street bailout is not something he should be bragging about
speechboy71	706652341425061888	2016-03-07T01:27:01	Shade ... thrown
speechboy71	706652270713282561	2016-03-07T01:26:44	The Sanders side-eye is one of my favorite things this election cycle
speechboy71	706652042832564229	2016-03-07T01:25:50	Why is Bernie Sanders always shouting?
speechboy71	706651455604858880	2016-03-07T01:23:30	Starting ... now 
speechboy71	706651244799107072	2016-03-07T01:22:40	Isn't what you would do to solve the problem &amp; prevent this from happening elsewhere? 
speechboy71	706650349235539968	2016-03-07T01:19:06	The debate shows national politics the way Americans see it—filtered through local issues:  
speechboy71	706649784464109572	2016-03-07T01:16:52	It *could* be described that way. Say, by a governor trying to shift blame to nameless bureaucrats. Hypothetically. 
speechboy71	706648173268357121	2016-03-07T01:10:28	So BernieSanders wins Maine. Will have to wait until exits to see how the African American family voted.
speechboy71	706648232198283264	2016-03-07T01:10:42	That was a particularly moronic question from Anderson Cooper.
speechboy71	706647126323949568	2016-03-07T01:06:18	Rick Snyder still being in office and Rubio and others praising him for his response remains awful.

speechboy71	706646400621219840	2016-03-07T01:03:25	Sanders somehow finds a way to bring Flint back to billionaires and income inequality
speechboy71	706556974775836672	2016-03-06T19:08:04	I'm no fan of Trump but this seems a bit melodramatic 
speechboy71	706536879986970625	2016-03-06T17:48:13	Scariest aspect of Trump's torture beliefs: ISIS sets the rules.

speechboy71	706526974756282368	2016-03-06T17:08:52	They'd be caught between obligation to uphold orders w/obligation not to carry out illegal orders &amp; reasonable to think they'd do the former
speechboy71	706526751116042240	2016-03-06T17:07:58	The smart point here is that if civilian officials change the law, like on Geneva protections for prisoners, hard for military to object
speechboy71	706526448694079488	2016-03-06T17:06:46	Not sure I agree w/ brooks_rosa on this but interesting arg that military WOULD carry out Trump's illegal orders 
speechboy71	706484949428207616	2016-03-06T14:21:52	The question, "who is worse, Trump or Cruz?" takes us into  dark, impenetrable territory.

speechboy71	705595716794593280	2016-03-04T03:28:22	Only one quick question on Flint - where thousands are at risk for lead poisoning just 45 minutes from the debate.
speechboy71	705595729402793984	2016-03-04T03:28:25	Republicans cheering Cruz falsely saying Detroit was failed by 60 years of failed left-wing policies ... stay classy GOP
speechboy71	705595384173875200	2016-03-04T03:27:03	So one question on Flint .. nice job Fox
speechboy71	705594874792321024	2016-03-04T03:25:02	It’s unfair to “politicize” Flint, oh well it’s good to know that some things, like the GOP’s denial of systematic racism, don’t change,
speechboy71	705594783713071105	2016-03-04T03:24:40	Rubio's answer on Flint was gross.
speechboy71	705594630130294784	2016-03-04T03:24:03	Rubio giving Rick Snyder credit on Flint ... shocking
speechboy71	705592340954681344	2016-03-04T03:14:58	I can't believe I'm saying this, but Fox is being unfair to Trump here
speechboy71	705591531856650240	2016-03-04T03:11:45	How are the Fox moderators hitting Trump harder than any of his opponents have?
speechboy71	705591066494267397	2016-03-04T03:09:54	Can't imagine voters are following this back and forth about Trump U
speechboy71	705591238691520514	2016-03-04T03:10:35	Why is Megyn Kelly doing oppo for Trump's opponents?
speechboy71	705590280767021057	2016-03-04T03:06:46	The crazy thing is that what Trump is saying about flexibility and realism in politics is perfectly reasonable.
speechboy71	705590196876791809	2016-03-04T03:06:26	I don't think Trump is claiming flexibility just defensively—he thinks it's part of his appeal. He also attacked Cruz for being intransigent
speechboy71	705590156238196737	2016-03-04T03:06:17	I agree. It's weird

speechboy71	705436275386372097	2016-03-03T16:54:49	IMO Romney made a huge mistake by not telling us what he thinks about the size of Trump's penis
speechboy71	705436564462116864	2016-03-03T16:55:58	Many folks are pointing out Romney's hypocrisy &amp; that's the problem. Attacking Trump w/o pointing out how GOP built up Trump is obfuscation
speechboy71	705435873085661184	2016-03-03T16:53:13	Romney's criticism of Trump is correct, but to be effective you need to offer an alternative. Romney is advocating for chaos in Cleveland
speechboy71	705435073022140416	2016-03-03T16:50:02	I'm sure Romney dislikes Trump intensely, but what the GOP really needs here is a reckoning on how Republican leaders created Trump-ism
speechboy71	705434879081771009	2016-03-03T16:49:16	Romney complaining about Trump creating scapegoats is a bit rich in light of that 47% comment

speechboy71	705433717142114305	2016-03-03T16:44:39	Mitt Romney, filled with Trump loathing, still won't endorse an alternative. And that's basically why Trump is on track to be the nominee.

speechboy71	705432667655970817	2016-03-03T16:40:28	normative BradMossEsq I need to move on, but the issue her is news judgment when violating privacy - not FOIA
speechboy71	705432358711922689	2016-03-03T16:39:15	Don't doubt Romney's sincerity but he said this: Trump has "extraordinary ability to understand how our economy works and to create jobs"
speechboy71	705431610808729600	2016-03-03T16:36:16	speechboy71 that was endorsed by 2016 nominee in 2012
speechboy71	705431379547394048	2016-03-03T16:35:21	It's pretty remarkable to see the 2012 Republican nominee deliver a speech unloading on the likely 2016 Republican nominee
speechboy71	705429955103100928	2016-03-03T16:29:42	marcambinder Again, the issue here is not where the material came from - it's the news judgment in publishing private communication
speechboy71	705429581491257345	2016-03-03T16:28:13	marcambinder Glenn wants to narrowly focus this on FOIA to avoid talking abt the privacy issues here, which he's very successfully done
speechboy71	705429415430328322	2016-03-03T16:27:33	marcambinder The Sony hack wasn't classified. Anyway, I think we're talking past each other a bit
speechboy71	705428490242433024	2016-03-03T16:23:52	marcambinder This is not about FOIA. I never raised that issue. Solely, about news judgment.
speechboy71	705428330707812354	2016-03-03T16:23:14	normative BradMossEsq That's to protect them. Not me
speechboy71	705428249434787840	2016-03-03T16:22:55	marcambinder No he didn't. The producer reached out to him
speechboy71	705428103129128960	2016-03-03T16:22:20	normative BradMossEsq That seems inconsistent to me. If info shouldn't be released, then people shouldn't feel restricted in their comms
speechboy71	705427870395604993	2016-03-03T16:21:25	marcambinder I think news orgs were well within their rights to publish from Sony hack ... doesn't mean it was right thing to do
speechboy71	705427775465922560	2016-03-03T16:21:02	marcambinder Again, I'm not questioning that. I'm questioning judgment of news org to publish
speechboy71	705427444908556288	2016-03-03T16:19:43	Sad! 
speechboy71	705427407164063744	2016-03-03T16:19:34	normative BradMossEsq But didn't you just say that FOIA is supposed to protect privacy of private individuals?
speechboy71	705427242877394944	2016-03-03T16:18:55	marcambinder In this particular case I struggle to see any public interest in violating Block's privacy
speechboy71	705427125466218496	2016-03-03T16:18:27	marcambinder Ok, I probably shouldn't have commented on your case, since I don't know specifics.
speechboy71	705426811266662403	2016-03-03T16:17:12	marcambinder Marc, I'm not suggesting FOIA should be weakened.
speechboy71	705426469267349504	2016-03-03T16:15:51	marcambinder To my mind, it's a question of news judgment. I can see the public interest in your emails being published. Not these.
speechboy71	705425767451238400	2016-03-03T16:13:03	ncardozo No. Surprised that a free speech org will compromise its principles regarding privacy
speechboy71	705425165690257408	2016-03-03T16:10:40	ncardozo But hey good to know that EFF has such a flexible view when it comes to publishing private email communication
speechboy71	705425022349869057	2016-03-03T16:10:06	ncardozo Influencing policy is responding to a media request from a VOA producer?
speechboy71	705424696733519872	2016-03-03T16:08:48	normative BradMossEsq To me that's irrelevant. Sole issue for me is decision of Intercept to publish.
speechboy71	705424132247310336	2016-03-03T16:06:33	ncardozo I assumed EFF would be uncomfortable w/the publication of an individual's private emails w/no public interest ... but I guess not
