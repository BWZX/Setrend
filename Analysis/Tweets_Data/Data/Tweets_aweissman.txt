aweissman	682618527765901312	2015-12-31T17:45:14	pfcidb robmitchum this kind of says it all to me (we'll see later if the tapes hold up, but the experience was A+)

aweissman	682615149459566596	2015-12-31T17:31:48	robmitchum feels like me like they are playing so well, are so happy, so much energy. 30+ years in it is remarkable
