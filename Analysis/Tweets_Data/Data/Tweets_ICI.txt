ICI	710099317932105729	2016-03-16T13:44:05	Mistele: I agree - no definition of what due diligence or oversight means. What degree of oversight is necessary? MFIMC
ICI	710099039321247744	2016-03-16T13:42:58	Downer: I think there's a substantial question about how exactly boards should oversee intermediaries. What is appropriate to ask? MFIMC
ICI	710098864070598656	2016-03-16T13:42:16	Salmon: Panel votes Red, except for Downer and Mistele, who vote Yellow. MFIMC
ICI	710098712505262080	2016-03-16T13:41:40	Salmon: Next issue involves intermediary oversight. Does this still resonate as an issue? Comfortable with where things stand? MFIMC
ICI	710098546788327424	2016-03-16T13:41:01	Salmon: Audience overwhelmingly voted Red on this issue. MFIMC
ICI	710098362549334017	2016-03-16T13:40:17	Donohue: We look at behavior, and when it violates the rule or the spirit of the rule, we will bring an enforcement action. MFIMC
ICI	710098244676808704	2016-03-16T13:39:49	Donohue: This is a concern inside the SEC to make sure that we don't make rules through enforcement; we try to balance our approach.MFIMC
ICI	710097950320566272	2016-03-16T13:38:38	McMillan: We've heard from staff that rulemaking has gotten "too hard" - easier to do through enforcement. Troubling trend. MFIMC
ICI	710097706358857732	2016-03-16T13:37:40	McGee: I'd rather have regulation by guidance than through enforcement actions. Very scary. MFIMC
ICI	710097626671267840	2016-03-16T13:37:21	Salmon: Red from all panelists except Donohue, who voted Yellow. MFIMC
ICI	710097427945099266	2016-03-16T13:36:34	Salmon: The next issue is "regulation by enforcement." Is the SEC creating new requirements through enforcement actions? MFIMC
ICI	710097292909551616	2016-03-16T13:36:02	Salmon: How did the audience vote? 50% Yellow, 34% Red. MFIMC
ICI	710096948011864065	2016-03-16T13:34:40	Donohue: I think it helps promote transparency about staff viewpoints on a particular issue; better than a speech or other comms. MFIMC
ICI	710096723163660288	2016-03-16T13:33:46	Zack: That said, I would rather know what staff is thinking about an issue, and this is an efficient way to do it. MFIMC
ICI	710096552266698753	2016-03-16T13:33:05	Zack: I do agree that the SEC staff needs to focus on the point where guidance should become a formal rulemaking. MFIMC
ICI	710096425166700545	2016-03-16T13:32:35	Zack: I hear your concerns, but I have found that these types of communications can be informative and help guide behavior. MFIMC
ICI	710096250310430720	2016-03-16T13:31:53	Mistele: It doesn't really give the industry an opportunity to comment; tends to be used as a standard. A troubling pattern. MFIMC
ICI	710096052079165440	2016-03-16T13:31:06	Salmon: Everyone voted Yellow, except for Mistele, who voted Red. MFIMC
ICI	710095933640458240	2016-03-16T13:30:38	Salmon: Next issue - the SEC's use of guidance updates: is it a form of de facto regulation? MFIMC
ICI	710095633575780352	2016-03-16T13:29:26	Salmon: Audience also predominantly voted Yellow for this issue. MFIMC
ICI	710095529091452928	2016-03-16T13:29:01	Downer: I also voted Yellow. Given the guidance we've received, things have been clarified. Waiting to see how enforcement plays out. MFIMC
ICI	710095262082048000	2016-03-16T13:27:58	Donohue: I voted Yellow, because this is a very important issue. But there's increased clarity out there about how to approach this. MFIMC
ICI	710095124517277696	2016-03-16T13:27:25	Salmon: First issue is "distribution in guise," which involves distribution and sub-accounting fees. Red, Yellow, or Green level? MFIMC
ICI	710094259974754305	2016-03-16T13:23:59	Salmon: The panelists also will be voting on their level of concern on each issue, which they've not seen. MFIMC
ICI	710093970148343812	2016-03-16T13:22:50	Salmon: This will be an interactive session, where the audience votes on its level of concern about different issues affecting funds MFIMC

ICI	710093554631254016	2016-03-16T13:21:10	Today's final panel is "Alert Level Red, Yellow, or Green: Putting Current Industry Topics into Perspective." MFIMC
ICI	710092779142123521	2016-03-16T13:18:06	That wraps up the morning's initial presentation at MFIMC. Panelists are taking the stage.
ICI	710092519456030720	2016-03-16T13:17:04	Rapoport: Some barriers to change include "perceived losses"; people's ability to create workarounds; reluctance to be first. MFIMC
ICI	710091208232706049	2016-03-16T13:11:51	Rapoport: Another great book that helps provide insights into creating good behaviors and incentives: "The Checklist Manifesto" MFIMC
ICI	710090028882509824	2016-03-16T13:07:10	Rapoport: Remember the ratio of 2:1 - people hate when you take something away about twice as much as when you give them something. MFIMC
ICI	710089660882669568	2016-03-16T13:05:42	Rapoport: The third is how people think and feel, and the fourth is the symbolic frame - the stories we tell about the organization MFIMC
ICI	710089495589351424	2016-03-16T13:05:03	Rapoport: First frame is the structural frame (org chart). The second is political - who has power. MFIMC
ICI	710089258107854849	2016-03-16T13:04:06	Rapoport: Setting cultural expectations matters. It's the first step - but not the only necessary one. MFIMC
ICI	710089081355685888	2016-03-16T13:03:24	Rapoport: It takes two or three people doing the same thing to affect the behavior of those around them. See  MFIMC
ICI	710088330877276161	2016-03-16T13:00:25	Rapoport: Social pressure is another factor that creates bias. People follow the social cues of those they associate with. MFIMC
ICI	710087959547158528	2016-03-16T12:58:57	Rapoport: Anchoring involves focusing on one factor to the exclusion of others. See . MFIMC
ICI	710087058094694400	2016-03-16T12:55:22	Rapoport: Diffusion of responsibility, also known as "the bystander effect." Everyone sees problem, thinks someone else will solve it MFIMC
ICI	710086839684698112	2016-03-16T12:54:30	Rapoport: People want to believe that they're good; admitting they'd engaged in unethical behavior creates cognitive dissonance. MFIMC
ICI	710086523841077250	2016-03-16T12:53:14	Rapoport: This is because when people realized they'd gone too far, they would have to admit they'd been unethical. Didn't want to. MFIMC
ICI	710086324062130177	2016-03-16T12:52:27	Rapoport: The results of the study showed that, 2/3 of the time, people will go too far. MFIMC
ICI	710085915914473472	2016-03-16T12:50:49	Rapoport: The Milgram experiments wanted to examine how the Holocaust happened; tested people's willingness to follow authority  MFIMC
ICI	710085502817443840	2016-03-16T12:49:11	Rapoport: Some basic cognitive errors and biases: cognitive dissonance, diffusion of responsibility, anchoring, confirmation bias MFIMC
ICI	710085298844274688	2016-03-16T12:48:22	Rapoport: Think about how the boss is rewarded. Connect the suggestion to the boss in a way that it affects that reward. MFIMC
ICI	710084836350955520	2016-03-16T12:46:32	Rapoport: What's the best way to deal with a boss who wants "yes men" around him or her? The flip answer is, "RUN." MFIMC
ICI	710084682600292352	2016-03-16T12:45:55	Rapoport: Another thing you can do, if the boss is reasonable, is to describe the behavior and its effects on the work produced. MFIMC
ICI	710084550966304768	2016-03-16T12:45:24	Rapoport: One way to nudge better behavior at the top is to have a friend on the board who can shape behavior. MFIMC
ICI	710084339044917248	2016-03-16T12:44:33	Rapoport: What you want to think about is, what behaviors drive you nuts about your boss? Are there ways to change them? MFIMC
ICI	710084166365421568	2016-03-16T12:43:52	Rapoport: It's not easy. One of the lessons from Enron is that the board facilitated all the bad behavior that went on. MFIMC
ICI	710084062006923264	2016-03-16T12:43:27	Rapoport: How do you nudge better behavior from those at the top of an organization? MFIMC
ICI	710083916976300032	2016-03-16T12:42:53	Rapoport: The question: Does "more hours worked" translate to "more value to clients"? MFIMC
ICI	710083776265756672	2016-03-16T12:42:19	Rapoport: When a firm gives bonuses for extra hours worked, it created perverse incentives, such as incentive to work more slowly. MFIMC
ICI	710082605492920320	2016-03-16T12:37:40	Rapoport: You can create default rules that promote ethical behavior. For example, a "clean desk rule" can protect personal info. MFIMC
ICI	710082254169620480	2016-03-16T12:36:16	Rapoport: You can do this, for example, through opt-in or opt-out rules. MFIMC
ICI	710082019909361664	2016-03-16T12:35:20	Rapoport: Ask yourself, what incentives work for or against the behavior you want? Think about what you'd like to change at work. MFIMC
ICI	710081764358758400	2016-03-16T12:34:19	Rapoport: We want to see who the corporate culture rewards and punishes. That's corporate culture, that's what matters. MFIMC
ICI	710081003528830976	2016-03-16T12:31:18	Rapoport: It's important to have someone in the room to slow down the decisionmaking, to ensure you make the right decision. MFIMC
ICI	710080810511155201	2016-03-16T12:30:32	Rapoport: A "devil's advocate" can play a valuable role. Every org needs one. Shouldn't be the same person, or they're ignored MFIMC
ICI	710080350358269952	2016-03-16T12:28:42	Rapoport: Having rules on paper is a good first step, but if you don't reward the behaviors, it's not going to do you any good. MFIMC
ICI	710080030202843136	2016-03-16T12:27:26	Rapoport: There are two basic types of cognitive errors: around the person, and around the situation. MFIMC
ICI	710079643320188928	2016-03-16T12:25:54	Rapoport: Though the Enron code of ethics laid out certain principles, the corporate culture ignored them - and employees followed. MFIMC
ICI	710079327644327937	2016-03-16T12:24:39	Rapoport: You cannot ever forget about human cognitive errors. You have to calibrate your rules &amp; guidelines to account for them. MFIMC
ICI	710078873426337792	2016-03-16T12:22:50	Rapoport: People notice what management rewards and doesn't reward, and act accordingly. MFIMC
ICI	710078018014867457	2016-03-16T12:19:26	Rapoport: To change culture, first figure out what it is. It's not what  we say, it's what we do. "Eat What You Kill" is a great book MFIMC
ICI	710077654595141633	2016-03-16T12:18:00	Rapoport: Every organization can use a nudge or two. Understanding human behavior &amp; corporate culture will help you get there. MFIMC
ICI	710076914350878722	2016-03-16T12:15:03	Rapoport: "Nudge" is a great book showing that there are ways of using tiny tweaks in behavior to make big changes in organizations. MFIMC
ICI	710076698285514752	2016-03-16T12:14:12	Rapoport: It's not just you have an incentive -- it has to be tailored to get the result you want. MFIMC
ICI	710076610746183682	2016-03-16T12:13:51	Rapoport: ...Until people started raising rats, to make money -- increasing the population! MFIMC
ICI	710076459612827648	2016-03-16T12:13:15	Rapoport: For example, Vietnam wanted to get rid of rats; offered people a "rat bounty." Worked at first. MFIMC
ICI	710076242805039105	2016-03-16T12:12:23	Rapoport: Default rules and nudging behaviors can have positive and negative (unintended) consequences. MFIMC
ICI	710076054673735680	2016-03-16T12:11:38	Rapoport: There are ways of implementing "subtle default rules" that can change behavior. MFIMC
ICI	710075693422551040	2016-03-16T12:10:12	Rapoport: All humans make certain cognitive errors, and corporate culture matters. MFIMC
ICI	710075578834092032	2016-03-16T12:09:45	Rapoport: Enron is a good example of this. Lots of smart people made dysfunctional because of bad incentives. MFIMC
ICI	710075354715725825	2016-03-16T12:08:51	Rapoport: People will do exactly what the incentives are encouraging them to do. MFIMC
ICI	710075185521672192	2016-03-16T12:08:11	Rapoport: If you don't like something that's going on at work, there's an incentive that's creating that behavior. Search them out. MFIMC
ICI	710075018101837824	2016-03-16T12:07:31	Rapoport: What irritates you about work? If you could tweak anything, how would you make your job more fun, productive? MFIMC
ICI	710074890183909380	2016-03-16T12:07:01	Rapoport: The overarching question: What would you change about your work, if you could change something? MFIMC
ICI	710074544497807360	2016-03-16T12:05:38	The presenter is NancyRapoport, acting executive VP &amp; provost, UNLV, Garman Turner Gordon Professor of Law, UNLVLaw MFIMC

ICI	709771160813182976	2016-03-15T16:00:06	Salmon: The trust that our shareholders have with us is what's on the line; don't ever think you've done enough with cybersecurity MFIMC

ICI	709769501848559617	2016-03-15T15:53:30	McNamara: First, do no harm. Understand what is going on, and only take steps that will have a positive effect. MFIMC
ICI	709769264899690498	2016-03-15T15:52:34	Walzer: Time is of the essence when you're dealing with a threat, and having a plan that covers every contingency saves time. MFIMC
ICI	709769006375378944	2016-03-15T15:51:32	McNamara: Absolutely. Keep an eye on your critical data, look for abnormal behavior and set up alerts, trace source of any problems MFIMC
ICI	709768861659340800	2016-03-15T15:50:58	Salmon: Should firms, as part of their response plans, include how they should respond to ransomware demands? MFIMC
ICI	709767739594940416	2016-03-15T15:46:30	Cunningham: You can utilize the benefits of having a large corporation behind you, but need to have your own policies &amp; plans MFIMC
ICI	709767565971742721	2016-03-15T15:45:49	Salmon: Should subsidiaries have their own cybersecurity processes &amp; policies, or rely on the parent company's? MFIMC
ICI	709767429539414018	2016-03-15T15:45:16	Cunningham: In other words, you need to have an overview of all your vendors' business relationships. MFIMC
ICI	709767301491458048	2016-03-15T15:44:46	Cunningham: We've been focused on third-party risk; we need to remember there's also fourth-, fifth-, or sixth-party risk. MFIMC
ICI	709767168880218117	2016-03-15T15:44:14	McNamara: Also should find a way of confirming that their self-assessment is actually accurate. MFIMC
ICI	709767051955609600	2016-03-15T15:43:46	McNamara: First step is to get the vendor to do a self-assessment; also should look at a monitoring service to oversee their ops. MFIMC
ICI	709766899798822913	2016-03-15T15:43:10	Salmon: What cybersecurity issues should funds consider when overseeing vendors that they hire? MFIMC
ICI	709766501478305792	2016-03-15T15:41:35	Cunningham: The role of auditing is changing. Internal Audit plays an impt role, since their staff touches every part of a firm. MFIMC
ICI	709765546284343297	2016-03-15T15:37:47	Walzer: Your tech people need to keep on top of what's going on - hackers are nimble, our people need to be nimble, too. MFIMC
ICI	709764500963074049	2016-03-15T15:33:38	McNamara: There is wariness, because sometimes patches create their own problems, so we try to test them first. MFIMC
ICI	709764392729059328	2016-03-15T15:33:12	McNamara: It's essential that people patch their systems. Hackers are aware that they don't, and exploit older versions. MFIMC
ICI	709764274797854720	2016-03-15T15:32:44	Salmon: What about patching? Does it only deal with symptoms and not causes? MFIMC
ICI	709764160528191488	2016-03-15T15:32:17	Cunningham: One best practices involves convincing people not to use one password for all the systems they access. MFIMC
ICI	709763933301821440	2016-03-15T15:31:23	Cunningham: New measures, such as biometrics, are coming, but we need to continue to minimize risks created in password systems. MFIMC
ICI	709763649183883265	2016-03-15T15:30:15	Cunningham: Hackers want passwords. Two-factor verification is a key tool in fighting them. MFIMC
ICI	709763520632659969	2016-03-15T15:29:44	Cunningham: Passwords are a pain, but they're not going away. We need to work with people to teach them best practices. MFIMC
ICI	709763398771318784	2016-03-15T15:29:15	Salmon: Can you talk about passwords and two-factor identification? MFIMC
ICI	709763093161705472	2016-03-15T15:28:02	Walzer: There are lots of vendors offering technology solutions for the problems we face, but there is no single technology solution. MFIMC
ICI	709762591191658496	2016-03-15T15:26:03	Walzer: I've been glad to see more collaboration on this front, including the work that ICI has been doing. MFIMC
ICI	709762503870443521	2016-03-15T15:25:42	Walzer: Even though fund firms vigorously compete for customers, when it comes to cybersecurity we're fighting the same foes. MFIMC
ICI	709761850758578176	2016-03-15T15:23:06	Walzer: Includes reporting to executive officers and board members at firms, reviewing all cybersecurity measures firm is taking MFIMC
ICI	709761641592836098	2016-03-15T15:22:16	Walzer: Best responses involve sharing information. We should report all kinds of different metrics. MFIMC
ICI	709761404954406914	2016-03-15T15:21:20	Salmon: How is this type of activity reported? MFIMC
ICI	709761251472228353	2016-03-15T15:20:43	McNamara: You need an incident manager who coordinates everything, across the organization. MFIMC
ICI	709761078977286145	2016-03-15T15:20:02	McNamara: Any time that you put into this is going to pay off in the long run. MFIMC
ICI	709761008638795776	2016-03-15T15:19:45	McNamara: Scope of testing - can run gamut from technical response to technical response plus business response. MFIMC
ICI	709760772323282944	2016-03-15T15:18:49	McNamara: Need experts in forensics and incident response. MFIMC
ICI	709760450142011393	2016-03-15T15:17:32	McNamara: Having a solid plan and process helps you deal with the chaos that is inevitable during a cyber incident. MFIMC
ICI	709760278452420608	2016-03-15T15:16:51	McNamara: We in IT partner with our business continuity team and communicators; makes our plan &amp; response better. MFIMC
ICI	709759980849782785	2016-03-15T15:15:40	McNamara: Create a cybersecurity plan, test it, have a process for implementing it, iterate as necessary and appropriate. MFIMC
ICI	709759824817426434	2016-03-15T15:15:03	McNamara: It doesn't cost much to get a process in place, but is immensely valuable in gaining time. MFIMC
ICI	709759704130519041	2016-03-15T15:14:34	McNamara: You have to have an organized process to ID threats, assess scope of impact, get controls in place, shut things down. MFIMC
ICI	709759523171516418	2016-03-15T15:13:51	Cunningham: We are constantly monitoring activity on our network, looking for abnormal behavior. MFIMC
ICI	709759416774631425	2016-03-15T15:13:26	Cunningham: As a result, our strategy has changed. Can't just use castle-and-moat approach. Have more eyes &amp; ears on internal network MFIMC
ICI	709759117045452800	2016-03-15T15:12:14	Cunningham: Number two - we need to deal with the tiny fraction of a bad actor or weak link within the organization. MFIMC
ICI	709758720989908992	2016-03-15T15:10:40	Cunningham: Number one -- we have to protect against stupid. I dealt w/an employee who had all his personal info posted in cubical. MFIMC
ICI	709758506044399616	2016-03-15T15:09:49	Cunningham: We generally think about cyberattacks as external threats, but can be internal, as well. MFIMC
ICI	709757407090573312	2016-03-15T15:05:27	Cunningham: We bring problems on ourselves by making too much personal information available through social media channels. MFIMC
ICI	709756982991970304	2016-03-15T15:03:46	Cunningham: But you can't make staff too paranoid -- we have to strike a balance, so they can continue to conduct business. MFIMC
ICI	709756858232401920	2016-03-15T15:03:16	Cunningham: All the education you receive at work can be applied -- should be applied -- at home, too. MFIMC
ICI	709756764422606848	2016-03-15T15:02:53	Cunningham: The human element is present in both sides: hackers and victims. Education &amp; awareness have never been more important MFIMC
ICI	709756617387069440	2016-03-15T15:02:18	Cunningham: Hackers are primarily motivated by financial gain. This isn't a technology problem; far more encompassing than that. MFIMC
ICI	709756420539990017	2016-03-15T15:01:31	Salmon: Scams have been reported in 79 countries, with funds sent to 72 countries (largest amounts to Hong Kong &amp; China). MFIMC
ICI	709756253258522624	2016-03-15T15:00:52	Salmon: The ability of hackers to compromise a company network through business email accounts also is a persistent problem. MFIMC
ICI	709755980733685760	2016-03-15T14:59:47	Salmon: Ransomware is on the rise; makes up 62% of all malware in the U.S. MFIMC
ICI	709755743289909248	2016-03-15T14:58:50	Salmon: Technology has changed, but the human element and how we interact with technology hasn't. MFIMC
ICI	709754405210431488	2016-03-15T14:53:31	Salmon: ICI is also starting a series of monthly blogs on cybersecurity. You can find the first one here:  MFIMC
ICI	709753930268418049	2016-03-15T14:51:38	Salmon: ICI also holds regular forums focusing on cybersecurity, held in Washington DC and in London. MFIMC
ICI	709753711028002816	2016-03-15T14:50:45	Salmon: ICI has a wealth of cybersecurity resources online:  MFIMC
ICI	709753337214849024	2016-03-15T14:49:16	Salmon: IT is a big player in cybersecurity. But the human element is just as important, if not more so. MFIMC
ICI	709753241630855168	2016-03-15T14:48:54	Salmon: Yet there's a very high cost to defend against cyberattacks. This gap is the problem. MFIMC
ICI	709753029831094272	2016-03-15T14:48:03	Salmon: The cost of computer power has come down dramatically, as have the skills required to write malware. MFIMC

ICI	709748653737566210	2016-03-15T14:30:40	Remember going to record store to buy an album? Online delivery of info was innovative—now it's fund industry's turn 
ICI	709744444132728834	2016-03-15T14:13:56	That wraps up our first panel from MFIMC. We're taking a short break, and will be back soon.
ICI	709742306820280320	2016-03-15T14:05:26	Ceresney: re: # of depositions, time - firms also take time during exams to prepare for any action; we don't have big time advantage MFIMC
ICI	709742038699405312	2016-03-15T14:04:23	Ceresney: The SEC chooses the forum, but that's true for all plaintiffs. MFIMC
ICI	709741850136092672	2016-03-15T14:03:38	Reid Melbourne: re: time extension, SEC has had unlimited time to conduct investigation &amp; respondent has limited time to respond. MFIMC
ICI	709741577321758720	2016-03-15T14:02:33	Reid Melbourne: Increase in number of depositions is still not enough, esp. in a complicated case. MFIMC
ICI	709741383062519808	2016-03-15T14:01:46	Reid Melbourne: There is no question in my mind that the SEC has a "home court advantage" in APs, even with new proposals. MFIMC
ICI	709741096201543680	2016-03-15T14:00:38	Ceresney: But we're introducing measures to increase transparency, length of time to hearing, number of depositions. MFIMC
ICI	709740846837534720	2016-03-15T13:59:38	Ceresney: Having a hearing quickly is in the interest of all parties involved. MFIMC
ICI	709740784485081088	2016-03-15T13:59:24	Ceresney: We use APs because they're a streamlined proceeding; district court cases can take years to resolve. MFIMC
ICI	709740571095654400	2016-03-15T13:58:33	Ceresney: Of course, the criticism is centered around litigation; last year, we only tried 20% of such cases as APs. MFIMC
ICI	709740331168894977	2016-03-15T13:57:35	Ceresney: We've been using administrative proceedings for many, many years. MFIMC
ICI	709740249681936384	2016-03-15T13:57:16	Hardin: The SEC has received criticism for relying on administrative proceedings, and instituted changes last year. Your view? MFIMC
ICI	709738368846979072	2016-03-15T13:49:48	Ceresney: Just keep in mind that, depending on where you are in the process, it could be an investigation plan, not an action plan MFIMC
ICI	709738204270891008	2016-03-15T13:49:08	Reid Melbourne: Make sure the remediation plan is clear, focused, and well-defined. Here is the problem, here is the action plan MFIMC
ICI	709737871129911296	2016-03-15T13:47:49	Ceresney: We don't expect you to do it right away, but don't wait until you remediate it completely; come to us with a plan. MFIMC
ICI	709737708638310401	2016-03-15T13:47:10	Hardin: What is the appropriate time period for self-reporting? MFIMC
ICI	709737346606870530	2016-03-15T13:45:44	Wyatt: Sometimes we even address findings during the course of the exam. MFIMC
ICI	709737262624411648	2016-03-15T13:45:24	Wyatt: We made the best decisions we can, based on the information we have. Then conduct exit call, discuss any findings. MFIMC
ICI	709736815905869824	2016-03-15T13:43:37	Wyatt: A lot of work goes in prior to an exam, creating the scope of the  exam; we limit scope, not trying to disrupt your business MFIMC
ICI	709736224353812480	2016-03-15T13:41:16	Reid Melbourne: Firms have to realize that there is no guarantee. You have to also show steps toward strong remediation. MFIMC
ICI	709735787512909824	2016-03-15T13:39:32	SEC Dir Wyatt says you run a PE shop &amp; haven't read SEC website, shame on you!   @ ICI MFIMC 
ICI	709735860678369280	2016-03-15T13:39:50	Ceresney: We're trying to show there are tangible benefits to self-reporting. MFIMC
ICI	709735655140630528	2016-03-15T13:39:01	Ceresney: It's a carrot-and-stick approach. There will be consequences if you don't self-report, but if you do, we may work with you. MFIMC
ICI	709735509329842176	2016-03-15T13:38:26	Ceresney: From my perspective, there's every incentive to self-report. Otherwise, you're just gambling. MFIMC
ICI	709733724942897152	2016-03-15T13:31:20	Ceresney: We're not just focused on statements that would discourage employees to talk to us, but other chilling factors as well. MFIMC
ICI	709733467978932226	2016-03-15T13:30:19	Ceresney: Anything that a firm does to discourage employees from talking to the SEC is a violation of the whistleblower regulations MFIMC
ICI	709732726501482496	2016-03-15T13:27:22	Wyatt: The work a firm needs to do to ensure they're in compliance with whistleblower guidelines are easy to implement. MFIMC
ICI	709732559631081472	2016-03-15T13:26:43	Hardin: Whistleblowers are an impt source of fraud tips for SEC. What work is OCIE doing on this topic? MFIMC
ICI	709732226771120128	2016-03-15T13:25:23	Wyatt: Make sure you're hiring for and focused on the key risks for your firm. MFIMC
ICI	709731913393684480	2016-03-15T13:24:08	Wyatt: When looking at your vendors' cybersecurity processes, we look for reasonable oversight by you. MFIMC
ICI	709731566633795585	2016-03-15T13:22:46	Reid Melbourne: Lines of communication have to be open and clear, and the relationship should be collaborative. MFIMC
ICI	709730976612675584	2016-03-15T13:20:25	Reid Melbourne: The first thing I try to find out is, what do you want first? What's most important, what's your time frame? MFIMC
ICI	709730728712540161	2016-03-15T13:19:26	Reid Melbourne: I work with the SEC staff to narrow down their requests, to limit the scope of data, in a secure format. MFIMC
ICI	709730259122462720	2016-03-15T13:17:34	Wyatt: This gives us indications of places to look; we still rely on the judgment of the staff for final decisions on where to go. MFIMC
ICI	709730098723823616	2016-03-15T13:16:56	Wyatt: What used to take weeks, we now do in minutes. So we're looking at more people, longer periods of data. MFIMC
ICI	709729659508891648	2016-03-15T13:15:11	Wyatt: We're looking for aberrant performance when we're deciding who to go examine. We have limited resources, must be risk-based. MFIMC
ICI	709729383716671489	2016-03-15T13:14:05	Wyatt: Because we routinely examine 10% of industry, people think we don't look at the other 90%. Couldn't be further from the truth. MFIMC
ICI	709729182482300928	2016-03-15T13:13:17	Wyatt: We're transparent, risk-based, and data-driven in our use of BigData. Helps drive who we go to examine. MFIMC
ICI	709728903653429248	2016-03-15T13:12:11	Ceresney: We can also look at activity across industries and look for aberrant results, see connections you couldn't otherwise see. MFIMC
ICI	709728543450796032	2016-03-15T13:10:45	Ceresney: We've been able to bring cases against foreign traders and hackers based on the use of these tools. MFIMC
ICI	709728363632533504	2016-03-15T13:10:02	Ceresney: What we're doing now is using tools to look for patterns that show, for example, insider trading. MFIMC
ICI	709728219969282048	2016-03-15T13:09:28	Ceresney: We have access to data we didn't have five years ago, and have new tools to analyze that data. MFIMC
ICI	709728119700197376	2016-03-15T13:09:04	Hardin: How are you using BigData in your work? MFIMC
ICI	709727908575760384	2016-03-15T13:08:14	Reid Melbourne: Firms have to have policies &amp; procedures to protect customer information, &amp; execute on those policies. MFIMC
ICI	709727726224199680	2016-03-15T13:07:30	Ceresney: The absence of harm doesn't mean there wasn't a failure, because a harm could occur &amp; we want to prevent that. MFIMC
ICI	709727539737075712	2016-03-15T13:06:46	Ceresney: The issue is, have you attempted in good faith to do enough to protect info? Are policies &amp; procedures in place? MFIMC
ICI	709726983656226816	2016-03-15T13:04:33	Wyatt: If there is a gaping hole found during an exam, we will refer to enforcement. CCOs need to know risks &amp; allocate resources MFIMC
ICI	709726657590988800	2016-03-15T13:03:15	Wyatt: I'm very impressed with the level of expertise that the Commission has been able to acquire in this space. MFIMC
ICI	709726551781326849	2016-03-15T13:02:50	Wyatt: OCIE does not enforce or make policy, but our findings do help inform those efforts at the SEC. MFIMC
ICI	709726424400338944	2016-03-15T13:02:20	Wyatt: If you're worried about cybersecurity because you're worried about an SEC exam, you're not getting it. Long-term issue. MFIMC
ICI	709726068354248705	2016-03-15T13:00:55	Hardin: OCIE has been conducting cybersecurity-related exams. What have you found? MFIMC
ICI	709725459156705280	2016-03-15T12:58:30	... and Marc Wyatt, director, Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, SEC_News. MFIMC

ICI	709724295031816192	2016-03-15T12:53:52	Massad: We didn't write detailed rules; we'd rather a pursuit of best practices be the widespread standard. MFIMC
ICI	709723965606985728	2016-03-15T12:52:34	Massad: We feel testing is the best way of doing this, and that testing is done on a regular basis, in accordance with best practices MFIMC
ICI	709723684425089024	2016-03-15T12:51:27	Massad: We recognize we're not a cyber agency, but we can help ensure that critical infrastructure is following best practices. MFIMC

ICI	709723129627734016	2016-03-15T12:49:14	Massad: We're open to considering these issues; we have limited staff in this area, so sometimes it takes some time to address them. MFIMC
ICI	709722350216978432	2016-03-15T12:46:08	Massad: agreement between tEU/US on derivatives regulation really just required minor changes by each side to solve equivalence issue MFIMC
ICI	709722904393609216	2016-03-15T12:48:21	Massad: We issued guidance on some issues a couple of weeks ago; our door continues to be open, and we're happy to engage on this. MFIMC
ICI	709722790111387649	2016-03-15T12:47:53	Blass: We've requested guidance from the CFTC on this -- is there any update you can give us? MFIMC
ICI	709722711573057536	2016-03-15T12:47:35	Blass: Many of our members are commodity pool operators. How will the amended Rule 4.5 affect them? MFIMC
ICI	709722237163737088	2016-03-15T12:45:41	Massad: U.S. and Europe represent so much of the market that this will eventually help globally. MFIMC
ICI	709722162136010752	2016-03-15T12:45:24	Massad: The agreement I recently made with Mr. Hill brought us closer together; provides a good foundation for us to move forward. MFIMC

ICI	709721367202164736	2016-03-15T12:42:14	Massad: Some rules are even different across the 50 states! Regulators around the world committed to harmonizing as much as possible MFIMC
ICI	709721169222619136	2016-03-15T12:41:27	Massad: It's impt to step back and remember that there is almost no area of regulation that is harmonized across borders. MFIMC
ICI	709720868822323200	2016-03-15T12:40:15	Blass: Thanks for your work on harmonization around margin rules for uncleared swaps. What else are you doing there? MFIMC
ICI	709720588592549888	2016-03-15T12:39:08	Massad: Report from SEC focused on limit up/limit down rules, price bands, etc.; NYSE is looking at this, too. MFIMC
ICI	709720459798056960	2016-03-15T12:38:38	Massad: There has been a lot of good work in that area; we'll continue to work with SEC_News on these issues. MFIMC
ICI	709720325026660352	2016-03-15T12:38:06	Blass: There seemed to be dislocations between different exchanges; they're now working to harmonize rules. MFIMC
ICI	709720218877206529	2016-03-15T12:37:40	Blass: Let's talk about the events of Aug. 24, where the markets experienced significant disruptions. MFIMC
ICI	709720040556371968	2016-03-15T12:36:58	Massad: We need to be focused on the future, on how the markets are evolving, and new risks we face. Cyber is a big part of that. MFIMC
ICI	709719912118427648	2016-03-15T12:36:27	Massad: Also issued proposals on cybersecurity and automated trading. Shows we're looking ahead, not just behind us. MFIMC
ICI	709719805335568384	2016-03-15T12:36:02	Massad: Also working on a cross-border application of the margin rule. Have been able to harmonize that with int'l standards. MFIMC
ICI	709719650234458112	2016-03-15T12:35:25	Massad: Reached an agreement with Europe on standards for centralized clearinghouses; implementing that agreement. MFIMC
ICI	709719531351048192	2016-03-15T12:34:56	Blass: What's your agenda these days? MFIMC
ICI	709718948808429568	2016-03-15T12:32:37	Chairman Massad has led the CFTC since his confirmation by the Senate in June 2014.  MFIMC
ICI	709718811256221698	2016-03-15T12:32:05	Our first guest this morning is Timothy Massad, chairman of CFTC. ICI General Counsel David Blass will engage in Q&amp;A with Massad. MFIMC.
ICI	709718672642875394	2016-03-15T12:31:32	We're about to start live-tweeting from day two of ICI's Mutual Funds &amp; Investment Management Conference. Follow MFIMC for more info.
ICI	709499949604605952	2016-03-14T22:02:24	Enrolling in an IRA today could help you build a nest egg while lowering your taxable income for 2015. More info: 
ICI	709498125778550784	2016-03-14T21:55:09	Remember going to record store to buy an album? Online delivery of info was innovative—now it's fund industry's turn 
ICI	709469655509934080	2016-03-14T20:02:01	That wraps up the first day of sessions at MFIMC. We'll be back live-tweeting tomorrow -- please join us then!
ICI	709468430311804928	2016-03-14T19:57:09	Salmon: Start with the data-rich parts of your organization, and work outward from there. MFIMC
ICI	709468196189954049	2016-03-14T19:56:13	Lalchand: If you want everything at once, you're going to end up with nothing. MFIMC
ICI	709468091248480256	2016-03-14T19:55:48	Lalchand: Look at it as a journey. You're not going to conquer the whole thing in a month. Start small, then build out incrementally MFIMC
ICI	709467822049660928	2016-03-14T19:54:44	Lalchand: If you understand the quality of your data, it will help you overcome many challenges going forward. MFIMC
ICI	709467707188645888	2016-03-14T19:54:17	Lalchand: The question is not only what is lurking in your data, but where is your data lurking? MFIMC
ICI	709467345853550592	2016-03-14T19:52:51	Dearman: That move from internal to external connectedness is extremely valuable; helps us create rules, and reduce risk. MFIMC
ICI	709467112478212098	2016-03-14T19:51:55	Dearman: That's step 1 -- that's remedial. After establishing ownership, you have to connect it. Move from inside to outside. MFIMC
ICI	709466936518840324	2016-03-14T19:51:13	Dearman: That requires someone who is accountable for data hygiene. MFIMC
ICI	709466865815396352	2016-03-14T19:50:56	Dearman: One problem we've encountered is silos -- "no single version of truth." You have to create single, reliable version. MFIMC
ICI	709466519462420480	2016-03-14T19:49:34	Ives: Data analytics enable us to do 100% sampling, so bad actors can't get by us. MFIMC
ICI	709466374784024576	2016-03-14T19:48:59	Ives: If the SEC would tell us what they're looking for, we can help with that. Info sharing between industry and regulators is key MFIMC
ICI	709466091328774144	2016-03-14T19:47:52	Stavrakos: We need to constantly be refining, in the huge amount of data we gather, to figure out what is signal, what is noise. MFIMC
ICI	709465878245601280	2016-03-14T19:47:01	Stahel: The key issues here are the quality of data, and the other is to have staff who are capable of running &amp; understanding models MFIMC
ICI	709465027296829442	2016-03-14T19:43:38	Ives: Data analytics belongs in almost every part of an organization. It enables people to learn from each other. MFIMC
ICI	709464372347858944	2016-03-14T19:41:02	Ives: These tools are limited only by the creativity of the people setting up rules in them. You can do any search you want. MFIMC
ICI	709464253338656769	2016-03-14T19:40:33	Ives: These types of tools will be key in making sure the data is organized well and clean, and able to be easily shared. MFIMC
ICI	709463511978655744	2016-03-14T19:37:37	Ives: 90 percent of audit teams use some type of data analytics in their testing. MFIMC
ICI	709463289080758273	2016-03-14T19:36:43	Ives: In my job, I actually herd cats -- CAATs (computer-assisted audit techniques). MFIMC
ICI	709461883733069824	2016-03-14T19:31:08	Dearman: We applaud our regulator partners, and look forward to doing even more knowledge sharing, in a collegial environment. MFIMC
ICI	709461701922529280	2016-03-14T19:30:25	Dearman: This will help us detect and predict unexpected correlations. We need to move to the concept of dynamic rule sets. MFIMC
ICI	709461297377759232	2016-03-14T19:28:49	Dearman: Reactive is reports; real-time is rules tools; the next step is predictive, which involves a lot of factor analysis MFIMC
ICI	709460879599910912	2016-03-14T19:27:09	Dearman: Our focus has been in moving from reactive to real-time data analysis and risk management. MFIMC
ICI	709459326268788737	2016-03-14T19:20:59	Lalchand: The longer firms wait to build out data analytics capability, the harder it will be for them in the future. MFIMC
ICI	709458836864802816	2016-03-14T19:19:02	JAlanReid Good question to ask him.
ICI	709458553585668098	2016-03-14T19:17:54	Lalchand: Don't think about what tools to have; think about what capabilities you need now, and will need. MFIMC
ICI	709458464297369600	2016-03-14T19:17:33	Lalchand: You need a roadmap. Build models and alerts that are flexible, can be easily calibrated and monitored. MFIMC
ICI	709458189587243008	2016-03-14T19:16:28	Lalchand: Data analytics is not something you can build and be done; you constantly have to monitor and upgrade. MFIMC
ICI	709457767946391553	2016-03-14T19:14:47	Lalchand: Most people look at data from a reactive perspective; being proactive can be costly, but is valuable. MFIMC
ICI	709455841276108801	2016-03-14T19:07:08	Stavrakos: We produce regular reports on best practices, event analyses, to inform others within the SEC. MFIMC
ICI	709455237350825984	2016-03-14T19:04:44	Stavrakos: We try to piggyback on exams to gather data, to lessen the burden on those being examined. MFIMC
ICI	709454956760330240	2016-03-14T19:03:37	Stavrakos: SEC goals are to try to stay current on best practices within the industry, to help inform policy. MFIMC
ICI	709454889601081344	2016-03-14T19:03:21	JAlanReid "Do You Know What’s Lurking in Your Data? The SEC Can Tell You"
ICI	709454378034450432	2016-03-14T19:01:19	JAlanReid Session 2-B: Do You Know What’s Lurking in Your Data? The SEC Can Tell You. Agreed
ICI	709453954955026432	2016-03-14T18:59:38	Stahel: SEC is also using statistical analysis and modeling to understand what outcomes would result from certain behavior. MFIMC
ICI	709453651744530432	2016-03-14T18:58:26	Stahel: We're using a broad set of databases to do analyses and search out risk. MFIMC
ICI	709453468931645440	2016-03-14T18:57:42	...and Christopher Stavrakos, senior financial analyst, Risk and Examinations Office, Division of Investment Management, SEC MFIMC

ICI	709451189625221120	2016-03-14T18:48:39	The panel is moderated by Tami Salmon, associate general counsel for ICI. MFIMC
ICI	709450953141968896	2016-03-14T18:47:42	We're going to focus on "Do You Know What’s Lurking in Your Data? The SEC Can Tell You," one of four concurrent sessions at MFIMC
ICI	709432826085699584	2016-03-14T17:35:41	We have four concurrent sessions happening now at MFIMC - see  for details. Too much good info to live-tweet!

ICI	709412575751118851	2016-03-14T16:15:12	ICI to SEC: Take action to ensure fund shareholders benefit from web delivery of reports  
ICI	709409342731247617	2016-03-14T16:02:22	That's the end of our second morning panel at MFIMC. We're taking a lunch break now, and will be back at 1:15 ET.
ICI	709409106793242624	2016-03-14T16:01:25	Dunn Kelley: Investors want choice, and our business has never been in a better position. Firms that don't evolve will perish. MFIMC
ICI	709408952518361088	2016-03-14T16:00:49	Kaplan: I think that active will adjust to match benefits of passive. MFIMC
ICI	709408778152759298	2016-03-14T16:00:07	Lai: I think we're going to see more direct consumer engagement than in the past: an increased emphasis on reaching investor directly MFIMC
ICI	709408597642498049	2016-03-14T15:59:24	Downer: I think the trend toward passive will peak soon. And paper is going away soon. MFIMC
ICI	709408505812410368	2016-03-14T15:59:02	Downer: What do you think will surprise people about the fund industry in the future? MFIMC
ICI	709408109719068673	2016-03-14T15:57:28	Downer: With increasing transparency and technology, I think value will prevail - the funds that offer that will do well. MFIMC
ICI	709407514715164672	2016-03-14T15:55:06	Abner: I don't think that index funds are having the oversized effect on the market that some believe is happening. MFIMC
ICI	709407254185955329	2016-03-14T15:54:04	Dunn Kelley: Yes, I think that's true, and there will a panel later today that will examine this question. MFIMC
ICI	709407108777771008	2016-03-14T15:53:29	Downer: Doesn't the market need active funds to balance index funds? MFIMC
ICI	709406588965142529	2016-03-14T15:51:25	Lai: Most advice will some combination of human and technology. Some (lower assets, DIY accts) will choose to use technology alone MFIMC
ICI	709406357909282817	2016-03-14T15:50:30	Lai: I agree, and think the DOL fiduciary proposal will only accelerate this change. MFIMC
ICI	709406184218951681	2016-03-14T15:49:49	Kaplan: They're saying we're not a competitor, but can be a partner. MFIMC
ICI	709406123636498432	2016-03-14T15:49:34	Kaplan: Roboadvisor firms are changing the way they're talking about themselves, trying to appeal to the advisor audience. MFIMC
ICI	709405856857718784	2016-03-14T15:48:31	Downer: In a situation where someone loses access to a human, what happens? MFIMC
ICI	709405664385355776	2016-03-14T15:47:45	Dunn Kelley: They can complement each other, but not replace each other. MFIMC
ICI	709405601110081536	2016-03-14T15:47:30	Abner: I think advice and software solutions can live very closely together. MFIMC
ICI	709405251380649986	2016-03-14T15:46:06	Abner: At some point, we will probably go through an unbundling of the services that an advisor provides. MFIMC
ICI	709404903236575232	2016-03-14T15:44:43	Abner: The asset allocation piece of what advisors were providing is become less expensive and more sophisticated. MFIMC
ICI	709403973409615872	2016-03-14T15:41:02	Downer: In many passive products, the cost of distribution is externalized, and the price can be higher in the long term. MFIMC
ICI	709403489408032768	2016-03-14T15:39:06	Abner: BigData is leading to new models and new approaches to investing. All of this is good news for investors. MFIMC
ICI	709403223933722624	2016-03-14T15:38:03	Abner: Roboadvisors are just newer, automated investment tools, which leverage ETFs and other passive investment solutions. MFIMC
ICI	709403050465697792	2016-03-14T15:37:21	Abner: Financial advisors are using passive investment vehicles in these asset allocation models. MFIMC
ICI	709402753471258624	2016-03-14T15:36:11	Abner: There is a transition underway from commission models to fee-based asset allocation. MFIMC
ICI	709402542766235648	2016-03-14T15:35:20	Downer: Let's look at trends in fund distribution, including roboadvisors. MFIMC
ICI	709400222577893377	2016-03-14T15:26:07	Abner: We're not looking for blind faith; we're looking for educated decisions. MFIMC
ICI	709399924744568832	2016-03-14T15:24:56	Abner: Sophisticated asset models, if done right, can help solve the problem. They need to be clear and easy to understand. MFIMC
ICI	709399446841380865	2016-03-14T15:23:02	Lai: There is potentially huge oppty for whoever is able to solve that problem. Too many Americans come in "underfunded." MFIMC
ICI	709399181413228544	2016-03-14T15:21:59	Downer: People would love to have a guaranteed investment return. But it's hard to do. How do you talk to people about that? MFIMC
ICI	709398606852321280	2016-03-14T15:19:42	Lai: Asset allocation may become more important that outperformance, depending on an investor's needs and goals. MFIMC
ICI	709397240884895744	2016-03-14T15:14:16	Lai: People are trying to figure out how to deal with market volatility, realizing they can't always just track the market. MFIMC
ICI	709397027587821568	2016-03-14T15:13:25	Lai: I think about investment solutions as products and services that meet client needs, rather than beating an index or market. MFIMC
ICI	709396582693736448	2016-03-14T15:11:39	Dunn Kelley: Why are there all these choices? Because different investors have different needs and goals. MFIMC
ICI	709396483150389248	2016-03-14T15:11:16	Kaplan: There's also too much choice in the passive space, especially with smart beta coming on the scene. MFIMC
ICI	709396134863769600	2016-03-14T15:09:53	Lai: Investors are already choosing. Passive seems to be replacing core active strategies, but other active niches are doing well MFIMC
ICI	709395971273334785	2016-03-14T15:09:14	Abner: It's difficult for investors to choose among thousands of active managers. We need to make it easy to understand differences MFIMC
ICI	709395638996344832	2016-03-14T15:07:54	Abner: Active management should move to a more transparent space, and then you could really compare what you're getting. MFIMC
ICI	709395542946795520	2016-03-14T15:07:32	Abner: I do think there is a place for both active &amp; passive. Index investing has come a long way; more sophisticated than ever MFIMC
ICI	709395147654610945	2016-03-14T15:05:57	Downer: What would the world look like if there were only index funds? Would it be a better place? MFIMC
ICI	709394838899318784	2016-03-14T15:04:44	Dunn Kelley: Every investor has a unique set of circumstances and objectives; active &amp; passive should thus be able to co-exist. MFIMC
ICI	709394479254540294	2016-03-14T15:03:18	Dunn Kelley: It's clear that most of the new money is going to passive strategies. It accounts for 38% of market new. MFIMC
ICI	709394007084941312	2016-03-14T15:01:25	Dunn Kelley: "Smart beta" advocates fall in the middle of the two sides. MFIMC
ICI	709393911559618561	2016-03-14T15:01:03	Dunn Kelley: There are advocates for creating alpha through active management; those on the other side focus on cost savings. MFIMC
ICI	709393703446712321	2016-03-14T15:00:13	Downer: Another topic important to the industry's future is active vs. passive management. MFIMC
ICI	709393335874678784	2016-03-14T14:58:45	Downer: The appropriate role of regulators is to protect investors, not pick losers or winners or point the business in a direction MFIMC
ICI	709393105519321088	2016-03-14T14:57:50	Kaplan: True, but it is increasingly difficult for the new entrant to do that. MFIMC
ICI	709392975311282176	2016-03-14T14:57:19	Lei: Where are the pockets of disruption that asset managers can recognize and exploit, for the benefit of investors? MFIMC
ICI	709392784621498368	2016-03-14T14:56:34	Lai: Regulation is clearly having an impact and disrupting industry. But this can be an opportunity to be seized. MFIMC
ICI	709392579218022400	2016-03-14T14:55:45	Abner: Good regulations can help people focus on the investor experience and the transparency of the product. MFIMC
ICI	709392447554633728	2016-03-14T14:55:14	Abner: There are still firms coming in, depending on the sector and the innovative tools they bring to the table. MFIMC
ICI	709392195581825025	2016-03-14T14:54:13	Dunn Kelley: I think the cost of regulation is forcing some, esp. smaller firms, to ask whether or not they can stay in the business. MFIMC
ICI	709391915616235520	2016-03-14T14:53:07	Downer: Where does the regulation stop? Is it stopping organizations from creating new funds? Is it a deliberate barrier to entry? MFIMC
ICI	709391495296655360	2016-03-14T14:51:26	Some of the rules could also unintentionally stifle innovation. MFIMC
ICI	709391245844586496	2016-03-14T14:50:27	Kaplan: There could be unintended consequences. In liquidity, for example, investors could choose most liquid, not most appropriate MFIMC
ICI	709390975173595136	2016-03-14T14:49:22	Kaplan: Regulation is coming at us more frequently, and is more costly, than ever before. MFIMC
ICI	709390740267405312	2016-03-14T14:48:26	Downer: We're going to talk about the drivers that can influence the future of the fund industry. MFIMC

ICI	709390198942081024	2016-03-14T14:46:17	We're back! The next panel at MFIMC is "The Future of the Fund Industry." MFIMC
ICI	709382570568499200	2016-03-14T14:15:59	David Blass, general counsel for ICI, is wrapping up the morning's first panel at MFIMC. We'll be back in about a half-hour.
ICI	709381022853570560	2016-03-14T14:09:50	Blizzard: I think they misunderstood the proposal - we bent over backwards to ensure that people could still get paper disclosures MFIMC
ICI	709380841596710912	2016-03-14T14:09:06	Blizzard: Regarding the disclosure proposal, we got comment letters asking for paper to be retained - "do not save the trees" MFIMC
ICI	709379941733953536	2016-03-14T14:05:32	WATCH: Refining market structure rules to better reflect today’s fast-paced markets 
ICI	709379454636847104	2016-03-14T14:03:36	Blizzard: If you want to update your comment letter based on what anyone else has said, we're always open to listening. MFIMC
ICI	709379317554401281	2016-03-14T14:03:03	Blizzard: We're examining these letters very carefully; it's really impt to get risk managers involved in this. MFIMC
ICI	709379157562662912	2016-03-14T14:02:25	Blizzard: We were impressed by the thoughtfulness of responses to the liquidity risk mgmt proposal; got lots of ideas. MFIMC
ICI	709378973239779328	2016-03-14T14:01:41	Merianos: We understand that the SEC has a concern, in this approach, about "the vast middle" - how will that affect investors? MFIMC
ICI	709378806612697088	2016-03-14T14:01:01	Merianos: We still see the six-bucket method of liquidity risk mgmt as unworkable. We think three categories would be better. MFIMC
ICI	709377319056646144	2016-03-14T13:55:07	Blizzard: Keep in mind these are still proposals; we are working hard to coordinate efforts within the SEC. MFIMC
ICI	709377114932441088	2016-03-14T13:54:18	Roye: If the SEC can step back and look at all of its risk-focused proposals together, perhaps they could be less prescription. MFIMC
ICI	709375789649825792	2016-03-14T13:49:02	Roye: Glad that SEC is focusing on cybersecurity, especially since they'll be sharing data with other regulators. MFIMC
ICI	709375109585354752	2016-03-14T13:46:20	Blizzard: Agenda at SEC and at FSOC are complimentary. SEC will continue to provide expertise to other bodies, at our own pace. MFIMC
ICI	709374778461851649	2016-03-14T13:45:01	Blizzard: This is about transparency, so risks can be better managed and controlled. MFIMC
ICI	709374621787758595	2016-03-14T13:44:24	Blizzard: Assets have climbed, products and strategies are expanding. We understand this gives investors oppty, but adds complexity. MFIMC
ICI	709374357907357696	2016-03-14T13:43:21	Blizzard: And we need a modernized framework for the regulation of how funds use derivatives. MFIMC
ICI	709374213975633920	2016-03-14T13:42:46	Blizzard: Elevating liquidity risk management to board level also aligns with SEC's mission. MFIMC
ICI	709374083864068096	2016-03-14T13:42:15	Blizzard: Regarding data reporting - the Commission, as primary regulator of fund industry, needs to be informed. MFIMC
ICI	709373869824602112	2016-03-14T13:41:24	Blizzard: Initiatives very much in line with the SEC's mission, and areas where we've been focused on for a long time. MFIMC
ICI	709373626366226432	2016-03-14T13:40:26	Blizzard: This goes back to Chair White's speech from Dec 2014, to modernize the regulatory regime. MFIMC
ICI	709373519931547648	2016-03-14T13:40:01	Blass: How do you view "risk proposals" - reporting, liquidity management, derivatives - working together? MFIMC
ICI	709373330672001024	2016-03-14T13:39:16	Blizzard: It's a vast agenda, but we have a very talented staff, so expect these to keep coming. MFIMC
ICI	709373235780034560	2016-03-14T13:38:53	Blizzard: Staff still looking at proposals re: stress testing, transition planning, and third-party compliance review. MFIMC
ICI	709372704361717760	2016-03-14T13:36:46	Panelists all agree that staff guidance and letters are helpful, while also agreeing that regulation should not be done that way. MFIMC
ICI	709372546320355328	2016-03-14T13:36:09	Loder: I remember a time when someone told me "there is as much lore as law" in SEC regulations and guidance. MFIMC
ICI	709370929118318592	2016-03-14T13:29:43	Blizzard: The 1998 supermarket letter, which dealt with payment for bundled services, formed the basis of our investigation. MFIMC
ICI	709370602306576384	2016-03-14T13:28:25	Blizzard: If you have identifiable distribution services you're paying for, that should be in a 12b-1 plan. MFIMC
ICI	709370194582478848	2016-03-14T13:26:48	Loder: The guidance doesn't provide a timetable where boards should examine such payments, but annually is a good practice. MFIMC
ICI	709369723578884096	2016-03-14T13:24:56	Merianos: It's a call for CCOs to ensure that there are policies &amp; procedures in place in case you're required to "prove a negative" MFIMC
ICI	709369440404676608	2016-03-14T13:23:48	Loder: But it also recognizes that boards should only provide oversight; they're not forensic analysts &amp; shouldn't be in the weeds. MFIMC
ICI	709369248209096704	2016-03-14T13:23:02	Loder: The guidance is does give helpful examples of circumstances where boards should examine things closely. MFIMC
ICI	709369114440110080	2016-03-14T13:22:30	Loder: The challenge for the board here is that the "strange passive language in 12b-1 is being complied with." MFIMC
ICI	709367110200332288	2016-03-14T13:14:33	Blizzard: As far as the board's role goes, this is the classic example of ensuring that no conflicts of interest exist. MFIMC
ICI	709366708365103105	2016-03-14T13:12:57	Blizzard: We wanted to make things better for boards, and make sure they have a process in place &amp; holistic view of payments. MFIMC
ICI	709366529859723265	2016-03-14T13:12:14	Blizzard: Looking at the range of possible results here, I view this as a good outcome. A joint effort by different SEC divisions MFIMC
ICI	709366320974921729	2016-03-14T13:11:24	Blass: What exactly is the staff's expectation of boards in the guidance? MFIMC
ICI	709366036626329600	2016-03-14T13:10:17	Loder: I encourage you all to read the guidance -- short, clear, easy to understand, and very useful. MFIMC
ICI	709365781767782400	2016-03-14T13:09:16	Loder: Boards should have a process in place to oversee payments made to intermediaries, and not do this in a vacuum. MFIMC
ICI	709365585017229312	2016-03-14T13:08:29	Loder: Also helpful because it gives insight into what staff thinks are good practices. Not overly prescriptive. MFIMC
ICI	709365324529967105	2016-03-14T13:07:27	Loder: Tone of guidance is measured, moderate, constructive. This is important. MFIMC
ICI	709365069872820224	2016-03-14T13:06:26	Loder: Guidance strongly reaffirms concepts that have been in the framework for a long time regarding payments to intermediaries. MFIMC
ICI	709364844600926208	2016-03-14T13:05:32	Blass: The SEC has given guidance on distribution and subaccounting fees, after several years of focus on the issue. MFIMC
ICI	709364178847453185	2016-03-14T13:02:54	Loder: Add to those SEC focus on liquidity and derivatives, and DOL's focus on fiduciary, &amp; fund initiatives around share classes. MFIMC
ICI	709363973414637568	2016-03-14T13:02:05	Loder: There are the implementation deadlines for money market fund reform. Also SEC focus on "distribution in guise." MFIMC
ICI	709363821740171264	2016-03-14T13:01:29	Loder: As David Grim said, this is as busy a time in terms of regulations as I've ever seen. MFIMC
ICI	709363627430645760	2016-03-14T13:00:42	Merianos: This looks like a page from the playbook of bank regulators. Is this the best way to oversee the capital markets? MFIMC
ICI	709363506596945921	2016-03-14T13:00:13	Merianos: We're looking at what could be a concerning trend of "regulation by testing." Stress testing is an example of this. MFIMC
ICI	709363269300043776	2016-03-14T12:59:17	Roye: The SEC now has a new constituent to think about other than investors and funds; now thinking about bank regulators. MFIMC
ICI	709363048734130176	2016-03-14T12:58:24	Roye: Looking at FSOC oversight of risk in the asset mgmt industry, and the overlap with SEC agenda &amp; rule proposals. MFIMC
ICI	709362887584833536	2016-03-14T12:57:46	Roye: Also looking at the fiduciary proposal from the USDOL, which will be very disruptive. Question if agency has the expertise. MFIMC
ICI	709362637851779074	2016-03-14T12:56:46	Roye: I agree w/David Grim that the staff has been very productive. Agree that alternative strategies should be adequately disclosed. MFIMC
ICI	709362287258247168	2016-03-14T12:55:23	Blass: What do you think are the breaking regulatory developments? MFIMC
ICI	709361878380716032	2016-03-14T12:53:45	... and Paul Roye, Director, Capital Research and Management Company. MFIMC
ICI	709361829806522368	2016-03-14T12:53:34	...John Loder, Partner, Ropes &amp; Gray LLP; Laura Merianos, Principal, The Vanguard Group... MFIMC

ICI	709361674134929408	2016-03-14T12:52:57	The next panel at MFIMC is "The Regulatory Outlook for Funds and Advisers." MFIMC
ICI	709361589644877824	2016-03-14T12:52:36	Grim: Thanks to ICI for providing opportunity to speak today. MFIMC
ICI	709361505427398656	2016-03-14T12:52:16	Grim: I'm approaching my 1-year anniversary as director of IM; struck by the dynamism of the industry, and IM's response. MFIMC
ICI	709361330218770432	2016-03-14T12:51:35	Grim: Funds should think about having a detailed playbook for how to respond if a crisis affects a service provider. MFIMC
ICI	709360989297381376	2016-03-14T12:50:13	Grim: When fund complexes outsource critical services to third parties, they need to perform due diligence on those providers. MFIMC
ICI	709360107751137280	2016-03-14T12:46:43	Grim: Markets change quickly, and funds should regularly review disclosures to ensure that they reflect funds' risk profiles. MFIMC
ICI	709359517880950784	2016-03-14T12:44:22	Grim: Liquidity risk management and daily redeemability continues to be a focus of attention for SEC, and should be for directors.  MFIMC
ICI	709358966074187776	2016-03-14T12:42:11	Grim: Comment period on the proposal regarding use of derivatives will close at the end of the month; looking forward to comments MFIMC
ICI	709358744187097088	2016-03-14T12:41:18	Grim: As part of reporting modernization, the SEC is also looking into electronic distribution of shareholder reports. MFIMC
ICI	709358330871980032	2016-03-14T12:39:39	Grim: Chair White has acknowledged the critical importance of cybersecurity, and is enhancing the SEC's cyber capabilities. MFIMC
ICI	709358140442157056	2016-03-14T12:38:54	Grim: Expanded data collection will require the Commission to pay special attention to cybersecurity concerns. MFIMC
ICI	709357950440251393	2016-03-14T12:38:09	Grim: More substantive, uniform reporting will allow the Division to better oversee the fund industry. MFIMC
ICI	709357743870758912	2016-03-14T12:37:20	Grim: Prudent liquidity management is even more vital in today's markets. MFIMC
ICI	709357647594651648	2016-03-14T12:36:57	Grim: There is a renewed interest in liquidity risk management because of volatility in the capital markets. MFIMC
ICI	709357135969255425	2016-03-14T12:34:55	Grim: The fund industry's vigorous participation in the rulemaking process is crucial. MFIMC
ICI	709357005539045376	2016-03-14T12:34:23	Grim: Rulemaking works best when it involves a dialog between the Commission and all commenters. MFIMC
ICI	709356374585708545	2016-03-14T12:31:53	Grim: Proposals have included those focusing on liquidity risk management, and derivatives. MFIMC
ICI	709356260630597633	2016-03-14T12:31:26	Grim: The past few years have been some of the most vibrant and innovative for IM that I recall. MFIMC
ICI	709355918316670976	2016-03-14T12:30:04	Grim is reminding the crowd that his remarks are his own, and not the views of SEC_News MFIMC
ICI	709355578229972992	2016-03-14T12:28:43	Blass: I know first-hand his exceptional talent, and his steadfast commitment to the SEC’s mission. Please join me in welcoming him. MFIMC
ICI	709355444813361153	2016-03-14T12:28:11	Blass: ...and about 12,000 investment advisers, with more than $62 trillion in assets under management. No small undertaking! MFIMC
ICI	709355386294419456	2016-03-14T12:27:57	Blass: Grim is responsible for administering the SEC’s regulatory functions for more than 10,000 mutual funds &amp; ETFs... MFIMC
ICI	709355324457754627	2016-03-14T12:27:43	Blass is now introducing the next speaker: David Grim, director of the SEC’s Division of Investment Management. MFIMC
ICI	709354636122198016	2016-03-14T12:24:59	Blass: The time for action is now. ICI is steadfast in our determination to see it through. MFIMC
ICI	709354552437383168	2016-03-14T12:24:39	Blass: The fund industry must take every oppty for innovation that an online delivery default will offer, for good of shareholders. MFIMC
ICI	709354533365948416	2016-03-14T12:24:34	Blass: ... or we can choose innovation. MFIMC
ICI	709354451887386624	2016-03-14T12:24:15	Blass: We have two choices: Stick with paper, with its cost and damage to the environment.... MFIMC
ICI	709354169652613121	2016-03-14T12:23:07	Blass: The SEC’s proposal is a great first step toward that end. Commission can’t afford to pass up the chance to adopt it. MFIMC
ICI	709354101625241600	2016-03-14T12:22:51	Blass: The SEC’s proposal is a great first step toward that end, and would be even better with ICI's recommendations included. MFIMC
ICI	709354029835526144	2016-03-14T12:22:34	Blass: Innovation has always been one of the fund industry’s core strengths. I’m just calling for us to expand on it. MFIMC
ICI	709353947211898880	2016-03-14T12:22:14	Blass: ICI today submitted letters to the SEC, NYSE, and FINRA calling for them to move on what I’ve just laid out. MFIMC
ICI	709353747881840643	2016-03-14T12:21:27	Blass: ...designed for operating companies, and allow fund shareholders to pay the fair fees they deserve. MFIMC
ICI	709353706349838336	2016-03-14T12:21:17	Blass: A tailored fee schedule designed by FINRA_News would untangle our industry from the current proxy-distribution paradigm... MFIMC
ICI	709353640650272768	2016-03-14T12:21:01	Blass: There's a better group to take on the challenge of governing funds’ delivery fees: FINRA_News, which oversees broker-dealers. MFIMC
ICI	709353600833753088	2016-03-14T12:20:52	Blass: The SEC needs to explain how NYSE fees apply to the online delivery of fund shareholder reports, focusing on cost savings. MFIMC
ICI	709353564813004800	2016-03-14T12:20:43	Blass: The SEC must first adopt its proposal to flip the default delivery model for shareholder reports from paper to the web. MFIMC
ICI	709353478636830720	2016-03-14T12:20:23	Blass: We have to clear these hurdles and set ourselves on a path toward greater innovation in fund disclosure. MFIMC
ICI	709353345643892737	2016-03-14T12:19:51	Blass: Clearly, this NYSE rule needs a rethink. In current form, it's ambiguous and, at worst, promotes abusive practices. MFIMC
ICI	709353227628756994	2016-03-14T12:19:23	Blass: Shareholders would stand to lose more than $1 billion in potential savings over the next decade alone. That is surreal. MFIMC
ICI	709353138638213120	2016-03-14T12:19:02	Blass: This means it would cost funds more not to deliver paper shareholder reports than they currently pay to deliver them! MFIMC
ICI	709353094115676161	2016-03-14T12:18:51	Blass: The processing fees it charges to funds that opt for the online delivery default would more than quadruple. MFIMC
ICI	709353042106261508	2016-03-14T12:18:39	Blass: Under the vendor’s interpretation of how the NYSE rule would apply to shareholder report delivery under the SEC’s proposal... MFIMC
ICI	709352979573448705	2016-03-14T12:18:24	Blass: Most brokers that distribute fund shares contract with this vendor to take care of the delivery of shareholder reports. MFIMC
ICI	709352926054055937	2016-03-14T12:18:11	Blass: Let me explain: a NYSE rule allows brokers to charge “processing fees” to funds for delivering shareholder reports. MFIMC
ICI	709352874384498689	2016-03-14T12:17:59	Blass: The proposal also is facing stiff opposition from the top vendor delivering fund shareholder reports on behalf of brokers. MFIMC
ICI	709352823318781952	2016-03-14T12:17:46	Blass: A statement like that highlights the absurdity of what the proponents of the paper delivery default are pushing for. MFIMC
ICI	709352745405444096	2016-03-14T12:17:28	Blass: This stubborn defense of paper brings to mind a great line from theofficenbc: “Limitless paper in a paperless world.” MFIMC
ICI	709352521874186240	2016-03-14T12:16:35	Blass: Some from paper industry have even posed as concerned senior citizens in comments without bothering to disclose those ties. MFIMC
ICI	709352415942844416	2016-03-14T12:16:09	Blass: This is especially true for people age 65 or older. MFIMC
ICI	709352362528403460	2016-03-14T12:15:57	Blass: The truth is, fund shareholders have greater 'net access &amp; use it for financial purposes more than general population. MFIMC
ICI	709352196631035904	2016-03-14T12:15:17	Blass: ...and inaccurately portray fund shareholders’ Internet access as lower than it actually is. MFIMC
ICI	709352137608839168	2016-03-14T12:15:03	Blass: They argue that it would disadvantage people with less access to the Internet, such as older people... MFIMC
ICI	709352070038605824	2016-03-14T12:14:47	Blass: Yet logical as this approach sounds, some groups are fighting hard against it, including the paper lobby. MFIMC
ICI	709351793478782976	2016-03-14T12:13:41	Blass: This would save shareholders hundreds of millions of dollars while preserving shareholder choice &amp; helping the environment. MFIMC
ICI	709351751028232192	2016-03-14T12:13:31	Blass: ...along with a postage-paid reply form and toll-free number that they could use to opt back in to receiving a hard copy. MFIMC
ICI	709351714047004672	2016-03-14T12:13:22	Blass: Shareholders would receive a notice with the website where the report is available online... MFIMC
ICI	709351671764291584	2016-03-14T12:13:12	Blass: Proposal would give funds the option to forgo mailing shareholders a full paper report. MFIMC
