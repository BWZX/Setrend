AaronKlein	717689296736632833	2016-04-06T12:23:57	jtcoyne29 There are lots of things to be offended by in the investment business. Let‚Äôs hope the market clears them all out now.
AaronKlein	717688471339589632	2016-04-06T12:20:40	I‚Äôm not known as the biggest fan of the Obama administration, but I think they got the DOL rule right: 
AaronKlein	717687068881776640	2016-04-06T12:15:05	jtcoyne29 Fair enough. If true, the market will drive those products since they are in the best interests of clients!
AaronKlein	717686902418251776	2016-04-06T12:14:26	dansantner LOL true.

AaronKlein	703688084756410368	2016-02-27T21:08:07	dpinsen That‚Äôs not a plan, it‚Äôs a spray-on tan posted on a web site.
AaronKlein	703688032893825025	2016-02-27T21:07:55	dpinsen Does he think they‚Äôre stupid enough to keep sending the money FOR A YEAR after he seizes the first 1/365th of it? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
AaronKlein	703687951587217408	2016-02-27T21:07:36	dpinsen Does he think they check an ‚Äúillegal immigrant‚Äù box on the wire transfer form? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
AaronKlein	703687882905497601	2016-02-27T21:07:19	dpinsen Dude, his proposal is ridiculous. ‚ÄúMake Mexico pay for it‚Äù by seizing $5 billion in cross-border wire transfers?
AaronKlein	703687267806646272	2016-02-27T21:04:53	dpinsen Rubio actually has a plan to accomplish it. Trump has bluster and no logical way to get there. Don‚Äôt trust either. Why pick Trump?
AaronKlein	703687103935225856	2016-02-27T21:04:14	dpinsen So President Trump will magically make the legislation better? üòÇ
AaronKlein	703685169832550400	2016-02-27T20:56:32	dpinsen Trump: ‚Äúbuild a wall and make Mexico pay.‚Äù Preposterous. That‚Äôs not a plan. It‚Äôs a demagogue con man‚Äôs attempt to manipulate.
AaronKlein	703685067277635585	2016-02-27T20:56:08	dpinsen ‚Ä¶track entry and exits on visas, etc. That would get illegal immigration under control.
AaronKlein	703684933215072257	2016-02-27T20:55:36	dpinsen Let‚Äôs pretend that we don‚Äôt trust any candidates. Rubio at least has a credible plan for immigration: secure border, e-verify,
AaronKlein	703684706580066304	2016-02-27T20:54:42	dpinsen But if you think Trump has a shred of authentic belief in what you stand for‚Ä¶no. He‚Äôs as phony as his fake university.
AaronKlein	703684454141669376	2016-02-27T20:53:42	dpinsen I get that you don‚Äôt like Rubio. I think you‚Äôre wrong, but I get it. Not trying to convince you.
AaronKlein	703683696247713792	2016-02-27T20:50:41	dpinsen There‚Äôs an even greater chance Trump will spark a nuclear war with Russia, which should definitely solve our immigration problem.
AaronKlein	703683279413649408	2016-02-27T20:49:02	dpinsen His fidelity to your policy beliefs is about as authentic as his spray-on tan.
AaronKlein	703683210098532352	2016-02-27T20:48:45	dpinsen Rarely has a presidential candidate SO inauthentic and untrustworthy been so blindly trusted‚Ä¶
AaronKlein	703683067039252480	2016-02-27T20:48:11	dpinsen You are trying to debate Rubio‚Äôs merits and we just disagree on that. It‚Äôs your trust in Trump that cracks me up.
AaronKlein	703682591921049600	2016-02-27T20:46:18	dpinsen Don‚Äôt want to debate the merits of Rubio on this issue with you; we just disagree. But believing in Trump is hysterical.
AaronKlein	703682479756947456	2016-02-27T20:45:51	dpinsen So you believe Trump can be influenced to the good a year ago, but one attempt at Rubio to compromise and he‚Äôs dead for life. LOL.
AaronKlein	703677767376764929	2016-02-27T20:27:08	dpinsen He‚Äôs like one of Andy‚Äôs roombapreneurs. As soon as he bounces into a wall, he‚Äôll just head off in whatever direction suits him.
AaronKlein	703677671847256065	2016-02-27T20:26:45	dpinsen He‚Äôs using you. Big time. He will abandon you in a general and in his presidency. Because he has no core.
AaronKlein	703677570810687488	2016-02-27T20:26:21	dpinsen This guy is a FARCE on policy!
AaronKlein	703677538837463040	2016-02-27T20:26:13	dpinsen Did you listen to his 2002 tape recording about the Iraq war? Did you see what he said about why Romney lost in 2012?
AaronKlein	703677453391126529	2016-02-27T20:25:53	dpinsen HA! No way.
AaronKlein	703676916276920324	2016-02-27T20:23:45	dpinsen He doesn‚Äôt need to puncture Hillary‚Äôs authenticity. She has none and voters already know it.
AaronKlein	703676777479049216	2016-02-27T20:23:12	dpinsen Rubio would eviscerate Hillary. At this point, given Hillary‚Äôs numbers, even Cruz would likely beat Hillary. And I despise Cruz.
AaronKlein	703676621052489729	2016-02-27T20:22:34	dpinsen For all you know, Rubio ripping the mask off the Fake Trumpster may have already evaporated half of Trump‚Äôs support.
AaronKlein	703676500013256704	2016-02-27T20:22:05	dpinsen Time will tell. I‚Äôll happily plant a stake in the ground and say Rubio is cooked if he loses.
AaronKlein	703675792035741696	2016-02-27T20:19:17	dpinsen I have zero worries about Rubio prevailing in a general election. I even think it‚Äôs possible Trump wins a general.
AaronKlein	703675631402258432	2016-02-27T20:18:38	dpinsen If Rubio doesn‚Äôt successfully puncture Trump‚Äôs false authenticity during the next two weeks, Trump wins. Period.
AaronKlein	703675520077078528	2016-02-27T20:18:12	dpinsen Let‚Äôs be clear: Rubio has to win Florida. If you believe Q poll, this is over. I don‚Äôt believe that poll is accurate.
AaronKlein	703673618157285376	2016-02-27T20:10:38	StartupSSingh Not if Hillary is the nominee. All of her baggage cancels out Trump‚Äôs.
AaronKlein	703673483197153280	2016-02-27T20:10:06	dpinsen Trump U, illegal immigrant labor on Trump tower, ties and suits overseas, spray-on tan‚Ä¶all about puncturing false authenticity.
AaronKlein	703673346940997632	2016-02-27T20:09:34	dpinsen Every Rubio attack tightly focused on ONE theme: puncturing the false authenticity Trump claimed to have.
AaronKlein	703672758039814144	2016-02-27T20:07:13	dpinsen Trump might end up winning the general with 47%.
AaronKlein	703672715392131072	2016-02-27T20:07:03	dpinsen Because if Hillary really imploded, he could get to 60% of the popular vote.
AaronKlein	703672069741883393	2016-02-27T20:04:29	Democrats really hate Rubio now. If he wins, he‚Äôs the candidate they fear the most. If he loses, he‚Äôs made all the Trump ammo ‚Äúold news.‚Äù
AaronKlein	703602855144398848	2016-02-27T15:29:27	balajis Wow, that is a powerful construct. Incredibly interesting perspective.
