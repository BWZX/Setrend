JonathanHoenig	688377860159975424	2016-01-16T15:10:45	JonathanHoenig - no difference in hate speech and speech. But whatever they can dip their hands into...they will!
JonathanHoenig	688368943258439680	2016-01-16T14:35:20	JonathanHoenig The whole idea of "hate speech" violates 1st Amendment. ("Hate crimes" fall in same category.)
JonathanHoenig	688368183250673665	2016-01-16T14:32:18	JonathanHoenig I hate hate speech. If hate speech was banned I wouldn't be able to ssy that.
JonathanHoenig	688368014765363200	2016-01-16T14:31:38	JonathanHoenig These days anyone who vocally disagrees with a Demwit is   accused of hate speech. But am STILL gonna call 'em as I see 'em!
