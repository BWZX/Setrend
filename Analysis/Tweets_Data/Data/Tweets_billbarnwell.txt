billbarnwell	726202472793051136	2016-04-30T00:12:16	Don’t see the value in the Titans drafting a second-round running back after trading for DeMarco Murray.
billbarnwell	726201129076400129	2016-04-30T00:06:55	Raiders fans should read what robertmays wrote about Jihad Ward’s story: 
billbarnwell	726198430738030593	2016-04-29T23:56:12	Bills likely considered Ragland at 19. Needed their David Harris-style inside linebacker against the run.

billbarnwell	726193970380980224	2016-04-29T23:38:29	Jaguars with one of the best drafts imaginable. With Ramsey, Jack, and Fowler being added, no more excuses for 26th-ranked D by DVOA.
billbarnwell	726191544680747008	2016-04-29T23:28:50	Myles Jack didn’t fit for Jags at 5 because of presence of Telvin Smith on weak side. A lot easier to swallow at 36.
billbarnwell	726190133461041152	2016-04-29T23:23:14	This is as much of a Jerry Jones draft as I can possibly imagine for the Cowboys.
billbarnwell	726140524802002945	2016-04-29T20:06:06	ICYMI: Wrote about last night’s trades , what they say for the teams involved and their thinking 
billbarnwell	726131597163008000	2016-04-29T19:30:38	Up at 538: my thoughts on the first round trades  
billbarnwell	726119225098686465	2016-04-29T18:41:28	Patriots acquired Brady with a comp pick and traded down repeatedly in the 2001 draft before Brady emerged.  
billbarnwell	726116991992500224	2016-04-29T18:32:36	If this is true, then whatever the Browns try is doomed to fail, so might as well go for empirical best practice 
billbarnwell	726114071758692352	2016-04-29T18:20:59	Not sure I understand why what the Browns did four years ago with an entirely different staff matters

billbarnwell	726109356232683520	2016-04-29T18:02:15	If you’re bad at drafting, seems like it would be better to have more shots at finding talent than not, so it does 
billbarnwell	726109177911906305	2016-04-29T18:01:33	minakimes the sixers might even not have failed!
billbarnwell	726108064496123905	2016-04-29T17:57:07	Fans comparing Browns to Sixers in stockpiling picks seems pointedly jaundiced given Patriots, Packers kickstarted their rebuilds that way.

billbarnwell	726076307566645248	2016-04-29T15:50:56	Treating NFL like it’s this obscure, incomprehensible sport only lifers can understand is bizarre, par for course

billbarnwell	725882790793908226	2016-04-29T03:01:58	As I wrote, last time a team with winning record took a QB in the bottom part of first round was when Packers took Aaron Rodgers.

billbarnwell	725870674959540224	2016-04-29T02:13:49	Jeff Saturday was an undrafted free agent. Weird to compare the 18th overall pick in the draft to him.
billbarnwell	725869701943988224	2016-04-29T02:09:57	It’s not that character doesn’t count. It’s that NFL teams aren’t necessarily great judges of character.

billbarnwell	725850259914657792	2016-04-29T00:52:42	Issue with Myles Jack is part the knee and part that players in his role aren’t valued highly by the NFL. Not a reflection on him.
billbarnwell	725847037393145856	2016-04-29T00:39:53	Jaguars having Jalen Ramsey fall to them at five is the best thing that’s happened to them on draft day in years.

billbarnwell	696535081452756993	2016-02-08T03:24:39	Incredible performance by the Broncos, who were fighting for their playoff lives in Week 16.
billbarnwell	696534730821496836	2016-02-08T03:23:15	tomecurran don’t trust your ability (or mine) to measure when a football player quits.
billbarnwell	696534189634691072	2016-02-08T03:21:06	The irony is that the same people trashing Newton are almost surely the ones who buried Peyton for his playoff performance in years past

billbarnwell	696529382421225472	2016-02-08T03:02:00	Great play by Von Miller. Cam’s gotta get that ball out earlier, though.

billbarnwell	691410195759665152	2016-01-25T00:00:11	Or - was it stupid that the Pats were put in pole position to win that Super Bowl because John Kasay put that kickoff out of bounds?
billbarnwell	691409763377225729	2016-01-24T23:58:28	Like - if the Pats win, is it any less dumb that game was decided in part by a lateral pass recovered by the Patriots to set up a TD?

billbarnwell	691402300162752514	2016-01-24T23:28:48	Broncos have to give Gronk the Tony Gonzalez treatment here. But then not sure what you do if you’re Pats.

billbarnwell	688513291770064896	2016-01-17T00:08:55	Chiefs did a pretty good job last year 
billbarnwell	688512910176456709	2016-01-17T00:07:24	Chiefs just haven’t found an answer in coverage to these Patriots option routes all day. And pass rush has been nonexistent.

billbarnwell	688507836696018944	2016-01-16T23:47:14	In addition to normal reasons to go for two down 9, makes more sense given the chance to still tie with TDs if you miss if NE scores again.
billbarnwell	688504879694897152	2016-01-16T23:35:29	Twice NE lined up with Gronk to line on backside of trips and Brady checked to widen him and gave him a 1-on-1 route
