rickjnewman	715645933866889217	2016-03-31T21:04:21	Capitalism is not zero-sum. Wealth gets created. But yeah this is the argument we're having now, big time.

rickjnewman	715640032288178177	2016-03-31T20:40:54	Sarcasm is NO WAY the lowest form of wit. Putting down the defenseless is.  
rickjnewman	715639847424303104	2016-03-31T20:40:10	And we're really talking about who's poor, not who's rich.  
rickjnewman	715639757347373057	2016-03-31T20:39:48	It's easier to define poor than rich. One way: unable to provide for basic necessities needed to survive.  
rickjnewman	715638290515378176	2016-03-31T20:33:59	You're only doing part of the math. Selective use of facts. I put all the assets and liabilities together.

rickjnewman	715637876277579778	2016-03-31T20:32:20	"America" is the country, not the govt. If he means govt, he should say govt.  
rickjnewman	715637737618018304	2016-03-31T20:31:47	Poor is not that relative. Both are rich. Finis.  
rickjnewman	715600251671986176	2016-03-31T18:02:49	Public sector is what government takes from the private sector.  
rickjnewman	715593202955329537	2016-03-31T17:34:49	Well that's 6 of you.    
rickjnewman	715592678591885312	2016-03-31T17:32:44	Sure I do. What portion of that comes from super PACs and which ones?  
rickjnewman	715592305906991104	2016-03-31T17:31:15	I'd say by neglect. Not by design.  
rickjnewman	715592205164027906	2016-03-31T17:30:51	Hey! I didn't get my super PAC payment this month!

rickjnewman	715563416044310529	2016-03-31T15:36:27	We live in a country in which the "poor" have TVs and smartphones. Perspective, please.  
rickjnewman	715563276311068672	2016-03-31T15:35:54	Some individuals are broke. America as a country is bursting with wealth.  
rickjnewman	715559708363464704	2016-03-31T15:21:43	My point is anybody who thinks America is poor doesn't know poor.

rickjnewman	715152507463401472	2016-03-30T12:23:39	Love that answer. 
rickjnewman	715000034086035457	2016-03-30T02:17:46	Because there's no emergency. If there were - see WW II.

rickjnewman	714997000618577920	2016-03-30T02:05:43	Good answer.  
rickjnewman	714996953277407233	2016-03-30T02:05:32	Yep. Still, he's paying a lot of his own money.  
rickjnewman	714996797920448512	2016-03-30T02:04:55	Congress could raise tax rates to 90% if it wanted to and make all tax sheltering illegal. If it wanted to.

rickjnewman	714990267028340739	2016-03-30T01:38:58	If you've never been to Trump's web site, here's the DONATE button. Can't miss it. 
rickjnewman	714990148237262851	2016-03-30T01:38:29	Copout. Come on, what year was peak prosperity? One would at least think it's after WWII. 
rickjnewman	714990025419722753	2016-03-30T01:38:00	However you define it. That's the point.  
rickjnewman	714989489605713920	2016-03-30T01:35:52	Govt can tax it if necessary. That's a huge power and it's why the USG borrows at 1.8%. 
rickjnewman	714989265168560128	2016-03-30T01:34:59	So fun reading the tweets without actually watching GOPTownHall. You can feel the heat from the exploding Trump without seeing the blast.
rickjnewman	714989038093082625	2016-03-30T01:34:05	One year because I'm going to count all the answers and examine the one year most mentioned.  
rickjnewman	714988811047059456	2016-03-30T01:33:11	Okay, which second?  
rickjnewman	714987429078417409	2016-03-30T01:27:41	Can you narrow it down to one year?  
rickjnewman	714987363856998404	2016-03-30T01:27:26	Can you pick one year in that decade?  
rickjnewman	714987289521352706	2016-03-30T01:27:08	Gotta narrow it down. Specify one year that was peak prosperity.  
rickjnewman	714987202275631105	2016-03-30T01:26:47	What year, specifically?  
rickjnewman	714983037470056450	2016-03-30T01:10:14	Totally idiotic to think the media cares. 
rickjnewman	714982907677450240	2016-03-30T01:09:43	What year would you say was peak prosperity?  
rickjnewman	714982789003796483	2016-03-30T01:09:15	Because America is packed to the gills with private wealth. Obviously not shared equally. But it's there.  
rickjnewman	714982674558005249	2016-03-30T01:08:48	Help us out people! We need to know what you think. Tell us America's best year, if you can

rickjnewman	706682605865926658	2016-03-07T03:27:17	buckeyes911 Economy doesn't grow on recycled money. It grows on innovation and productivity gains. A zero-sum "recycle" economy is bad.
rickjnewman	706682357819035652	2016-03-07T03:26:18	buckeyes911 Research the oil embargo of the 1970s. Lack of home grown oil cause a nasty recession. Trade was vital.
rickjnewman	706681807400529920	2016-03-07T03:24:07	buckeyes911 Yeah but we can't. No country has all the raw materials it needs. There is no such place on Earth. That's why trade exists.
rickjnewman	706681592631140352	2016-03-07T03:23:15	buckeyes911 ... phenomenally better than no trade. Or trade with so many rules that regulators get paid more than producers.

rickjnewman	706681226950795264	2016-03-07T03:21:48	buckeyes911 You're saying here in the US we should only buy things made in the US. That would be a disaster. Once you start drawing lines..

rickjnewman	706679887533350913	2016-03-07T03:16:29	Why not a city, county, state or region. What's so magical about a country?  
rickjnewman	706679781979529217	2016-03-07T03:16:04	You think a country is a natural boundary for trade. All should stay within. But why a country?  
rickjnewman	706679662110490627	2016-03-07T03:15:35	Actually it's not simple. It's complicated and people who try to make it simple are charlatans.

rickjnewman	706678872255963136	2016-03-07T03:12:27	That's the story of the whole Dem primary. Not just one debate.  
rickjnewman	706678141889220608	2016-03-07T03:09:33	No it's not. You're buying from somebody. Country doesn't matter. You pay, you get something. That's trade.

rickjnewman	706664645596221441	2016-03-07T02:15:55	You read that wrong. Burman said the diff between Sanders and HRC plans is very clear. Little similarity or overlap. 
rickjnewman	706664253319675905	2016-03-07T02:14:21	Well the GOP implosion is happening right now. What are you willing to wager on a Sanders presidency?

rickjnewman	706138329016836096	2016-03-05T15:24:31	I'd argue the opposite. Very little is politically possible in this environment. Check back with me in a year.
