veroderugy	708117397195116548	2016-03-11T02:28:38	Rubio is good on debt. And realistic about what's happening if we don't address Medicare, SS and Mesicaid. Good for him.
veroderugy	708116743642877952	2016-03-11T02:26:02	Trump is in favor of 25 percent cuts to benefits in 2034. Alright then.

veroderugy	708112736618745857	2016-03-11T02:10:07	Okay I didn't get what Cruz was saying in trade. I got the part about Obama is bad but the rest was lost on me.
veroderugy	708112186300829696	2016-03-11T02:07:55	Trade is good because of the imports, not because of the exports. The exports are what you pay to get the imports.
