MikeMadden	713370346473332741	2016-03-25T14:21:59	btshapir OK, but the percentage of insureds who are Type 1 diabetics on insulin can't be high enough that it drives their policy, can it?
MikeMadden	713368016159956996	2016-03-25T14:12:43	btshapir In some cases, it's cheaper -- my share of a doctor visit is often less than my previous copay used to be.
MikeMadden	713367937202184192	2016-03-25T14:12:24	btshapir This plan charges coinsurance on everything, not just prescriptions, and not just insulin.
MikeMadden	713367685367795712	2016-03-25T14:11:24	btshapir It's all very silly in practice, even if reasonable in concept.
MikeMadden	713367628316876801	2016-03-25T14:11:10	btshapir And making me pay some of the cost of test strips, which this plan does, is just an incentive to test blood sugar less.
MikeMadden	713367541180186625	2016-03-25T14:10:50	btshapir But I'm not going to switch insulins to save some money. (Or insulin pumps, to save on supplies there.)
MikeMadden	713367421114036224	2016-03-25T14:10:21	btshapir Right, there's no question this is cheaper for the insurer. The concept behind it is supposed to be making me price-shop.

MikeMadden	713366657561976832	2016-03-25T14:07:19	btshapir So the premium isn't really directly comparable. I just don't like "coinsurance," which I think yields only short term savings.
MikeMadden	713366462006706176	2016-03-25T14:06:32	btshapir It costs about the same, but it's a different employer.
MikeMadden	713366220909584384	2016-03-25T14:05:35	TopherSpiro KunkleFredrick But I wasn't on the Post's insurance in previous years, so I don't know if they used to use copays.
MikeMadden	713366115737542656	2016-03-25T14:05:10	TopherSpiro KunkleFredrick I think it's just the nature of the plan -- it's an Aetna POS plan with an HSA component.
MikeMadden	713365517311074304	2016-03-25T14:02:47	TopherSpiro KunkleFredrick (Er, not that I have to explain copays to you.)
MikeMadden	713365449388474372	2016-03-25T14:02:31	TopherSpiro KunkleFredrick So now I pay a percentage of the drug cost, vs. a flat fee for prescriptions.
MikeMadden	713365313828569089	2016-03-25T14:01:59	TopherSpiro KunkleFredrick No, it's because I switched from an insurance plan that worked on copays to one that has coinsurance.
MikeMadden	713363008962105344	2016-03-25T13:52:49	awgaffney Right. There is apparently some kind of effort to DIY a generic version, which is really an indictment of the system.
MikeMadden	713362698562625536	2016-03-25T13:51:35	freddiedeboer Also, I went to college in the '90s, so weed was definitely a college drug, too.
MikeMadden	713362569533239297	2016-03-25T13:51:04	TopherSpiro Lilly. I looked into their discount program, but the mail-order price is actually a better deal than using their coupon.
MikeMadden	713362216830050304	2016-03-25T13:49:40	freddiedeboer Ah, true. I went to college in a city, so we didn't really have townies.
MikeMadden	713361980531339265	2016-03-25T13:48:44	awgaffney I'm fortunate enough that the price difference is only irritating. But yes, it's a ridiculous concept.
MikeMadden	713361509494218754	2016-03-25T13:46:52	KunkleFredrick I was on my wife's company's insurance, but she left her job last year, so we switched to the Post's.
MikeMadden	713361345274593280	2016-03-25T13:46:12	KunkleFredrick True (though I'm guild-exempt). This is more a critique of this concept in insurance than of the specific plan.
MikeMadden	713361050863865856	2016-03-25T13:45:02	An ambulance ride and an ER visit would definitely cost me and my insurer far more than the difference between Humalog and another brand.
MikeMadden	713360783439228929	2016-03-25T13:43:59	So once again, the idea that patients will be price-sensitive, and thus save money, turns out to be shortsighted. Surprise.
MikeMadden	713360637292888064	2016-03-25T13:43:24	Yes, there are probably cheaper brands (no generics), but when I've used alternative kinds, I've wound up in ER for hypoglycemia.
MikeMadden	713360514936606720	2016-03-25T13:42:55	My copay for insulin on previous insurance plan was $28/month. Now: $118 coinsurance. Sigh.

MikeMadden	709837804793102336	2016-03-15T20:24:55	The "at least" in the lede here is doing a lot of work: 
MikeMadden	709837622345134080	2016-03-15T20:24:11	Reason for shutdown: A cable caught fire at 4:30 a.m. Monday. Worry was there would be repeat of Jan. 2015 L'Enfant Plaza smoke incident.
MikeMadden	709837585867251712	2016-03-15T20:24:03	BCAppelbaum I was mostly joking about that, though, and actually, I bet they didn't even calculate effect of weekend work vs. shutdown.
MikeMadden	709837472491032576	2016-03-15T20:23:36	BCAppelbaum It's conceivable that the delays necessary to get this done piecemeal would affect more people than tomorrow's nonsense.
MikeMadden	709837165140819969	2016-03-15T20:22:22	BCAppelbaum Er, sorry -- only in the sense of how to disrupt service for repairs, not whether.
MikeMadden	709836956356767744	2016-03-15T20:21:33	willsommer I think you can now cease to exist, vanishing in a puff of smoke, after making the joke you were put on this earth to make.
MikeMadden	709836753096613888	2016-03-15T20:20:44	Surge pricing? More like The Purge pricing.
MikeMadden	709836489862025216	2016-03-15T20:19:41	BCAppelbaum Maybe the new Metro GM is just a really hardcore utilitarian.
MikeMadden	709836262522413058	2016-03-15T20:18:47	(Uh, especially my 4 1/2 year old daughter who walks to school and is rarely on time.)
MikeMadden	709836099141632001	2016-03-15T20:18:08	And what will dcpublicschools do? Seems unfair to hold kids accountable for being at school on time if Metro closes on short notice.
MikeMadden	709835908682543106	2016-03-15T20:17:23	I am a big advocate for riding the bus. But a weekday w/out Metro trains is not the day to introduce 1000s to the joys of the bus.
MikeMadden	709835702746349568	2016-03-15T20:16:34	So the federal government will have to give liberal leave, at least, right?
MikeMadden	709835547766820864	2016-03-15T20:15:57	BCAppelbaum Suffice it to say, I am curious to hear their explanation for why they're doing it this way.
MikeMadden	709835261467889666	2016-03-15T20:14:49	BCAppelbaum But if they did repairs through two months' worth of single-tracking, would it still? Maybe this is less disruptive overall.
MikeMadden	709835053757538305	2016-03-15T20:13:59	BCAppelbaum Also, lawyers aside, wouldn't you rather ride a subway where they've fixed all the cables that they know can cause fatal fires?
MikeMadden	709834896773087233	2016-03-15T20:13:22	BCAppelbaum I agree with your basic point, but I think drunk driving is different -- it's more of an operator error problem, isn't it?
MikeMadden	709834280936054785	2016-03-15T20:10:55	BCAppelbaum Sure. But once you identify a problem, I think you have to fix it, if it's already killed someone and injured others.
MikeMadden	709834027495251968	2016-03-15T20:09:54	BCAppelbaum I'm sure Metro's lawyers would agree with me, even if you don't.
MikeMadden	709833983404675072	2016-03-15T20:09:44	BCAppelbaum But zero casualties from preventable fires with known, fixable causes is probably a reasonable standard, no?
MikeMadden	709833804693815296	2016-03-15T20:09:01	Zero casualties is an excessive standard for transportations systems. We certainly don't apply it to automobile transportation.

MikeMadden	709789724043509761	2016-03-15T17:13:52	ByronTau OKnox I think it can be, since it's mostly conducted in the street, but I oppose mandatory helmet laws.

MikeMadden	709789407327473668	2016-03-15T17:12:36	ByronTau OKnox I was traveling pretty slowly on Mt. Pleasant Street, with cars, crosswalks, etc. A kid ran out from between parked cars.
MikeMadden	709788418826444800	2016-03-15T17:08:40	ByronTau OKnox Not having a helmet wouldn't have affected whether the accident happened.
MikeMadden	709788278728347649	2016-03-15T17:08:07	ByronTau OKnox My accident was unavoidable, it was either stop short/fall off bike doing it, or crash into kid who ran into street.
MikeMadden	709787610546380801	2016-03-15T17:05:28	ByronTau OKnox On the other hand, I also assigned/edited this: 
MikeMadden	709787385727422464	2016-03-15T17:04:34	ByronTau OKnox While I understand Byron's argument, I'll note that the only time I was in a bike accident, I hit my head on the pavement.

MikeMadden	707774194029883393	2016-03-10T03:44:52	edenwillow It's kind of a miracle.
MikeMadden	707773246859567104	2016-03-10T03:41:06	edenwillow That's probably right.
MikeMadden	707772809116782592	2016-03-10T03:39:22	Post's Ed O'Keefe working like the rent is due while *someone* lounges in the background,‚Ä¶ 
MikeMadden	707772846571913217	2016-03-10T03:39:31	edenwillow I'm not 100 percent sure what that point is, or that I really disagree with you on the underlying principle, either.
MikeMadden	707772762950127617	2016-03-10T03:39:11	edenwillow Yeah, I think that's  very reasonable. But at some point it seems crazy to let rich people benefit from (more) subsidies.
MikeMadden	707772174774439936	2016-03-10T03:36:50	edenwillow I do think you'd have to put the cap relatively high in order to keep people in favor of the basic idea, though.
MikeMadden	707772038870601728	2016-03-10T03:36:18	edenwillow That answer crossed paths with your question.
MikeMadden	707771901435846656	2016-03-10T03:35:45	edenwillow (By the same token, I'm not sure my wealthy grandfather should be getting Social Security benefits anymore.)
MikeMadden	707771752617738240	2016-03-10T03:35:10	edenwillow I'm fine with raising all taxes to cover free tuition, but I think the benefit should be income-capped.
MikeMadden	707771573474889728	2016-03-10T03:34:27	edenwillow ... and one went to a public school. Why shouldn't my parents have paid for the public school tuition?
MikeMadden	707771470982864896	2016-03-10T03:34:03	edenwillow For instance, my parents (thankfully) could afford to pay tuition for me and my brothers. Two of us went to private schools...
MikeMadden	707770883780255744	2016-03-10T03:31:43	edenwillow Everyone would already be contributing through taxes. But I think people wealthy enough to contribute far more, should.
MikeMadden	707770439402184706	2016-03-10T03:29:57	edenwillow Otherwise you run the risk of Congress deciding that $30,000 in tax hikes ought to be spent on something else.
MikeMadden	707770300864335872	2016-03-10T03:29:24	edenwillow But wouldn't it be simpler to just charge rich people $30,000 a year for school if they can afford it?
MikeMadden	707769394525507588	2016-03-10T03:25:48	edenwillow There's no tuition at all for high school and/but their families do pay property taxes to fund secondary education.
MikeMadden	707768858254450689	2016-03-10T03:23:40	Bjornapoor Plenty of wealthy families send their kids to out-of-state state schools now, though.
MikeMadden	707768706638675970	2016-03-10T03:23:04	karlitaliliana I think plenty of wealthy families would still send their kids to state schools (for one, they might not get in elsewhere)
MikeMadden	707768268090707968	2016-03-10T03:21:19	Ideally, you could have free tuition that excluded wealthy families without sacrificing the broad support. (Not possible, right?)
MikeMadden	707768126004457473	2016-03-10T03:20:45	I understand the idea that universal entitlements have a broader base of support, but I'm still not sure rich kids should get free college.
