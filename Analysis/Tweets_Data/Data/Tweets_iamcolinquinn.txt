iamcolinquinn	699366874463784960	2016-02-15T22:57:11	We couldn't do anything. You needed 2/3s of both houses to agree. We were both circuit court. We just had to sit there and take it.

iamcolinquinn	692465599071535108	2016-01-27T21:53:58	Why do they call it the old college try? It doesn't make sense. What? Do people not try in high school?

iamcolinquinn	690033798298386432	2016-01-21T04:50:52	iamcolinquinn KevinFCorrigan CherryLnTheatre honestly this post needs no hashtag

iamcolinquinn	690032397782507520	2016-01-21T04:45:18	Instead of one upping each other on twitter we should be thumb upping each other while buying a friend a beer at a sports bar.
iamcolinquinn	690031909750063104	2016-01-21T04:43:22	I don't want to sound too corny but maybe instead of worrying about the Dow Jones we started worrying about "Old lady Jones" next door.
iamcolinquinn	690031599887519745	2016-01-21T04:42:08	I'll say this gang. With everything that's going on today, it may sound corny but maybe the most powerful nuke we have is a soft smile.
iamcolinquinn	690029721028005888	2016-01-21T04:34:40	Went to NYC this xmas. Went thru the MOMA and the MET, but iamcolinquinn's New York Story CherryLnTheatre was by far the best art I saw.

iamcolinquinn	689930277225918466	2016-01-20T21:59:31	Like I said before anything that's general and is a setup or premise is not a joke!  amyschumer is no thief. Not a good friend, however.
iamcolinquinn	689671085097406464	2016-01-20T04:49:34	Welp I guess it's time to say good night. But know this: My only thoughts this year are Content. Quality. Focus. Everything else means nada.

iamcolinquinn	689666181184225282	2016-01-20T04:30:05	I have " a good natured resolve" to make sure that you ( the customer) are satisfied with at least 3 "water cooler" tweets a day!
iamcolinquinn	689664744345726977	2016-01-20T04:24:23	iamcolinquinn also what allowed you to land a part in the silent epic. Die Nibelungen: Siegfried 
iamcolinquinn	689664569996898304	2016-01-20T04:23:41	Remember this. What happens on twitter stays on twitter. And the mantra for Sweet Sixteen is "Keep it Fun".

iamcolinquinn	689663627360653312	2016-01-20T04:19:56	I'll tell you what. I'm stoked to deliver great comedy to you in "Sweet Sixteen". It's almost become an obsession. And that's a good thing.
iamcolinquinn	688932533216645121	2016-01-18T03:54:50	iamcolinquinn amyschumer That's a trick question Colin...you have no imagination.
iamcolinquinn	688932105829638144	2016-01-18T03:53:08	Is it my imagination or was the whole crowd murmuring "He does look too young" when amyschumer gave her skit tonight on criticschoice.
iamcolinquinn	688790026872725505	2016-01-17T18:28:34	iamcolinquinn 
iamcolinquinn	688789638593540096	2016-01-17T18:27:01	iamcolinquinn but you'll lose the timing of jokes. And if we learned anything from ur time on SNL weekend update your timing is impeccable
iamcolinquinn	688789613658411008	2016-01-17T18:26:55	iamcolinquinn  Nobody gets hurt? Your jokes hurt us all on a very deep, though impersonal, level.
iamcolinquinn	688789071255187456	2016-01-17T18:24:46	Last idea: The audience stays home, I put my jokes on twitter and everyone has a laugh, nobody pays and nobody gets hurt.
iamcolinquinn	688788475064233984	2016-01-17T18:22:24	iamcolinquinn can everyone in the audience just get a mass text "start laughing"?
iamcolinquinn	688787820534738945	2016-01-17T18:19:48	How about a comic who stays in the hotel and you watch an empty stage and the waitresses hand you the jokes with your check at the end?
iamcolinquinn	688787172305035266	2016-01-17T18:17:13	How about a comic who gives the crowd the mike and then they do his act while he serves drinks and does Jon Taffer impressions?
iamcolinquinn	688786933246464000	2016-01-17T18:16:16	Fans let's put it this way. Have you ever seen a comedian who treats the mike like it's part of the audience. That's the kind of thing...
iamcolinquinn	688786497336524800	2016-01-17T18:14:32	iamcolinquinn Are you nervous people won't laff because they are so stunned by the innovation?
iamcolinquinn	688785745121796096	2016-01-17T18:11:33	Suffice to say the laughs will be coming from a deep place. They will resonate long after I've moved on to the next state or country or city
iamcolinquinn	688785428359581697	2016-01-17T18:10:17	It'll be exciting. Been working on some new material that's kind of...I don't want to say breakthrough because that sounds...arrogant...but
iamcolinquinn	688784606066307076	2016-01-17T18:07:01	Saw iamcolinquinn's show yesterday down in the west village.  A must go for any New Yorker
iamcolinquinn	688782415481950209	2016-01-17T17:58:19	iamcolinquinn no doubt about it! Show in Belfast perhaps? Loved unconstitutional by the way!
iamcolinquinn	688782712056840193	2016-01-17T17:59:30	iamcolinquinn The Midwest is becoming bored with meth and nude selfies. It's time for a dose of CQ.
iamcolinquinn	688783008879480832	2016-01-17T18:00:40	easy to see why iamcolinquinn isn't booked in Ireland; local comedians have been stealing his material: 
iamcolinquinn	688782091115474945	2016-01-17T17:57:02	iamcolinquinn 
iamcolinquinn	688780967901802496	2016-01-17T17:52:34	My guarantee if I do get to your town: I promise quality humor delivered in a timely manner. My commitment to excellence is unsurpassed.
iamcolinquinn	688780167515361280	2016-01-17T17:49:23	iamcolinquinn BIG JOE prepares for CQ'S arrival! 
iamcolinquinn	688779724097761281	2016-01-17T17:47:37	iamcolinquinn I speak for tens of people when I say this; Do a show in Galway, it's a small place, you might even sell out.
iamcolinquinn	688777602409058304	2016-01-17T17:39:11	If I don't get booked in Ireland very shortly, when I do get over there it will not be pretty. This is getting insulting and I've had it.
iamcolinquinn	688777152028872705	2016-01-17T17:37:24	iamcolinquinn any chance of a show in Dublin, Ireland?
iamcolinquinn	688777324892962816	2016-01-17T17:38:05	I'm not one of these snobs that doesn't respect my fans. f you live in let's say oh I don't know God Forbid Tenessee I will do a show there!
iamcolinquinn	688776622363783168	2016-01-17T17:35:18	And yes maybe even Canada. I know how it is up there, you need me more than I need you and I respect you for knowing that.
iamcolinquinn	688776400711630849	2016-01-17T17:34:25	Great news. May be heading to your town. New England, Midwest, South even the "left coast". Haha. Keep your fingers crossed fans.

iamcolinquinn	688578100079235072	2016-01-17T04:26:26	Don't turn on Green Bay game. Blowout
iamcolinquinn	688562100319481857	2016-01-17T03:22:52	My head hurts from laughing. Mark of a great evening with iamcolinquinn. Nailed it all perfectly.
iamcolinquinn	688514438958346241	2016-01-17T00:13:28	iamcolinquinn Your show made me fall in love with New York all over again, you geriatric Irish Park Slope hick
iamcolinquinn	688519298466365440	2016-01-17T00:32:47	Got suckered into seeing iamcolinquinn at the Cherry Lane Theatre by the Gong family, and it wasn't to deliver takeout.
iamcolinquinn	688534342491107328	2016-01-17T01:32:34	CrankyOne123 iamcolinquinn Congratulations, i officially welcome you to the gang.
iamcolinquinn	688464340794609664	2016-01-16T20:54:24	iamcolinquinn I hate that I thought "I wonder if he's really saying something here".
iamcolinquinn	688423887042924544	2016-01-16T18:13:39	iamcolinquinn Just called the cops, gang. Neighbor tweeted this photo of CQ being taken away. bail,anyone? 
iamcolinquinn	688424155662778370	2016-01-16T18:14:43	iamcolinquinn I appreciate how you blend a Jungian gestalt into the framework of a Piagetian genetic epistemological model of humor
iamcolinquinn	688424125941956608	2016-01-16T18:14:36	iamcolinquinn I'd love to say I hang on every word you say. Even just one word if it could hold my weight.
iamcolinquinn	688422522367406080	2016-01-16T18:08:14	iamcolinquinn Come on man. Leave us alone. What's your deal?
iamcolinquinn	688422080384241664	2016-01-16T18:06:28	Heck, maybe your "ego" gets involved in this too? Am I the only one with an ego? Oh, yeah you want to get into it? Okay, lets do this!!!
iamcolinquinn	688421803564359680	2016-01-16T18:05:22	Sounds like you fans have issues with my tweeting style. Maybe it's you?  Maybe you need to read them differently.
iamcolinquinn	688419363758731264	2016-01-16T17:55:41	iamcolinquinn Definition of insanity: Doing same thing over &amp; over and expecting different results. Or every CQ followers awful reality
iamcolinquinn	688418393356107776	2016-01-16T17:51:49	View this weekend through the prism of your entire existence. And think of past weekend mistakes and don't make them. Simple, huh group?
iamcolinquinn	688417081373659136	2016-01-16T17:46:37	Then you got the Packers Cardinals. The meat and cheese eating blue collar American "packer" vs the flighty sunbelt seed eating birds.
iamcolinquinn	688415949586694144	2016-01-16T17:42:07	iamcolinquinn Meanwhile a cut off nerve root at L4/5 makes it impossible for me to walk or carry my own weight upright. Crisis what crisis?
iamcolinquinn	688415632040136704	2016-01-16T17:40:51	iamcolinquinn On 26th they will open my neck from skull to shoulders and use rods, brackets and screws to fuse all but one of 7 vertebrae.
iamcolinquinn	688415851603574784	2016-01-16T17:41:43	The Colonialists vs The Indigenous would probably attract more fans to the game. And would match the helmets better. Right, gang?
iamcolinquinn	688415341400190977	2016-01-16T17:39:42	The Patriots and the Chiefs are playing. I guess American History repeats itself. You look at the uniforms and you go "Oh my heavens".
iamcolinquinn	688414803203874816	2016-01-16T17:37:33	Remember while you people venerate celebrity culture as embodied by me, and I enjoy it, it's idolatry and that's a mortal sin. knowit
iamcolinquinn	688414481093931008	2016-01-16T17:36:17	If you break it out down "Weak" "End". Basically a frail epitaph to an invigorating life affirming work week!
iamcolinquinn	688414161429250049	2016-01-16T17:35:00	We look forward to the "weekend" then when it gets here it brings up a lot of existential crises. Sometimes "down time" can bring us down.
iamcolinquinn	688413402365046784	2016-01-16T17:31:59	amyschumer I've been watching you the past few months. You are surrounding yourself with thieves and idiots. Watch your "purse".
iamcolinquinn	688412882212532224	2016-01-16T17:29:55	iamcolinquinn I would definitely welcome that change for you
iamcolinquinn	688412538569146368	2016-01-16T17:28:33	iamcolinquinn 
iamcolinquinn	688412298801729537	2016-01-16T17:27:36	Death is not to be feared. It should be viewed as a welcome change.
iamcolinquinn	688411608813584384	2016-01-16T17:24:52	Don't forget to have a great weekend. Because for some of you it'll be your last one!
iamcolinquinn	688148565550481410	2016-01-15T23:59:37	Let this weekend be a tribute to your better natures, team. Help a stranger on with ice skates, shovel the walk of a city official.
iamcolinquinn	688147092351549441	2016-01-15T23:53:46	Welp I guess the lesson for you gang is don't gaze into the abyss because you might find the abyss gazes into thee ( you)- Nietzsche
iamcolinquinn	688145852238450688	2016-01-15T23:48:50	iamcolinquinn just watched long story short. What an impression. To me at least. History, philosophy, decadence...everything in the mix
iamcolinquinn	688144889352081409	2016-01-15T23:45:01	To me the new incivility is not so new. As a matter a fact it's been around since the first caveman were writing on the cave walls!!
iamcolinquinn	688144542994837507	2016-01-15T23:43:38	My new twitter tough talk attitude is being mischaracterized as part of the coarsening of the culture. It is anything but!
iamcolinquinn	688069501741563906	2016-01-15T18:45:27	Because believe me I have better things to do than get on twitter all the time and ruin people's day. Trust me on that one.
iamcolinquinn	688068900353912832	2016-01-15T18:43:04	I really read you people the riot act today. Just know it was for your own good. Do you think I get pleasure out of bothering you?
iamcolinquinn	688034092970053632	2016-01-15T16:24:45	iamcolinquinn After reading the line "bust my bacons", I almost punched a stranger sitting next to me on the train....

iamcolinquinn	688021114396762118	2016-01-15T15:33:11	Yeah you fans want to dish out it out but you can't take it. You want to bust my bacons every day but now the shoes on the other foot.

iamcolinquinn	688014744310181888	2016-01-15T15:07:52	In fact, if I see one comment on here, I'm gonna report you and have you tossed off twitter for inappropriate commentating.
iamcolinquinn	688014483093110784	2016-01-15T15:06:50	Clam up and listen to the master for a change. Keep your comments to yourself. That's right that's what Friday January whatever is about.
iamcolinquinn	688014325781512192	2016-01-15T15:06:12	Here's a concept. You shut it and you learn something from a king of twitter. Geez, but we want to say...shut up!
iamcolinquinn	688014117144231936	2016-01-15T15:05:22	Because believe it or not, this is my twitter feed and sometimes you people tend to forget that. So just shut your traps and let me do me.
iamcolinquinn	688013929306570753	2016-01-15T15:04:38	How about today twitter just for me, gang? No feedback from you, no trying to be clever or shocking, just shut up and listen for a change .

iamcolinquinn	683324844604321793	2016-01-02T16:31:53	Remember something fans. If anybody gives you a "'tude" this year give them an affectionate smile and say "Sweet Sixteen ain't about that".
iamcolinquinn	683324057945767936	2016-01-02T16:28:45	If one of your 2016 goals is to read more by whip smart authors, go read iamcolinquinn's Coloring Book stat. 
iamcolinquinn	683322888263479296	2016-01-02T16:24:06	SI_Drew iamcolinquinn Agreed. This clip personifies my mood after every CQ Tweet 
iamcolinquinn	683321206737645569	2016-01-02T16:17:25	What iamcolinquinn 's tweets do to my psyche 
iamcolinquinn	683320681841475584	2016-01-02T16:15:20	Colin: ( deep breath looks around and cries out to the sky) Hello, Sweet Sixteen! What do you have in store for us? Sky: All good things!
iamcolinquinn	683319487651774464	2016-01-02T16:10:35	I make one promise this year. Quality tweets filled with scintillating "obsos" about life  smooth setups and stinging "PL's."
iamcolinquinn	683316402862866433	2016-01-02T15:58:20	Empathize with those who appreciate. Those who don't well we don't want to discuss what's going to happen to them now do we? Haha.
iamcolinquinn	683316070497816576	2016-01-02T15:57:01	It's the year of compassion! Kick downers and negative people to the curb. That's where they belong. Let them bleed out in the gutter.
iamcolinquinn	683315421336997890	2016-01-02T15:54:26	As we look back upon the upcoming year we will be filled with the knowledge that we "gave it our all". And that's pretty darn satisfying.
iamcolinquinn	683314919660470272	2016-01-02T15:52:26	iamcolinquinn i thirst for your blood
iamcolinquinn	683314860634062850	2016-01-02T15:52:12	SI_Drew iamcolinquinn this is my reaction 
iamcolinquinn	683314845505196032	2016-01-02T15:52:09	iamcolinquinn Jesus Christ: ENOUGH OF THIS ALREADY
iamcolinquinn	683315048039747586	2016-01-02T15:52:57	"Try" is not a word I want to hear out of you fans this year. No more huddling in your hovels like trapped rats! Get out there and achieve!
iamcolinquinn	683314734003806208	2016-01-02T15:51:42	As we bring to fruition some of our goals and objectives we will be comforted to know that we're doing so in the magic hour "Sweet 16!"
iamcolinquinn	683312792758259712	2016-01-02T15:43:59	Why do I call it "Sweet Sixteen?" Well, I just have a really good feeling about the upcoming future ahead and therefore I call it that.
iamcolinquinn	683311973291917312	2016-01-02T15:40:44	"SS" promises to be a banner year if things continue on an upward trajectory.

iamcolinquinn	683310089365786624	2016-01-02T15:33:15	Already started referring to this year as "Sweet 16". People seem to be connecting with that one. Could be a potential income source.
iamcolinquinn	683299809999097857	2016-01-02T14:52:24	Excited to see iamcolinquinn perform TheNewYorkStory at the CherryLaneTheater tonight. I love him! Nice start to 2016!

iamcolinquinn	682571989081567233	2015-12-31T14:40:18	This year is about focusing on product. And that means tweets that reflect both the national mood and my own quirky comic take on things.
iamcolinquinn	682571511098650624	2015-12-31T14:38:24	And my New Years resolution is to make sure my tweets are funny, smart and reflect my commitment to excellence.
