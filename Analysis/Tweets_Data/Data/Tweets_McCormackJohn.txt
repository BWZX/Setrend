McCormackJohn	708295419864846337	2016-03-11T14:16:02	Praise for Trump's debate performance last night isn't just defining the presidency down. It's defining America down.
McCormackJohn	708302477611900930	2016-03-11T14:44:04	Reporters covering Trump, I can already tell you what he will say when you ask him a process question: I'm winning, or I will win, or I won.
McCormackJohn	708302867585765376	2016-03-11T14:45:37	Trump March 2016: “I think it’s time to end the debates.”  Trump March 2020: “I think it’s time to end the elections."

McCormackJohn	708296633688203264	2016-03-11T14:20:51	Exactly. I mean, what are you gonna say at this point? He really could shoot someone, his vote share wouldn't change 
McCormackJohn	708295007468294144	2016-03-11T14:14:23	Why the "positive" debate strategy? Can't pry away the 35% Trump voters. R needs C &amp; K supporters in FL, K to solidify OH, C gain elsewhere.
McCormackJohn	708279302983389185	2016-03-11T13:11:59	Creeping normalization of Trump watch - remarkable how many in media want to accommodate/treat as just another cand.

McCormackJohn	708279434256617472	2016-03-11T13:12:30	Reminder to America: That guy who sucker punched the protestor? His vote counts as much as yours. Happy Democracy!

McCormackJohn	708141420058648576	2016-03-11T04:04:05	Just like last time, CNN goes to a ChrisCuomo puff interview of donaldjtrump.
McCormackJohn	708140446397038592	2016-03-11T04:00:13	Before you go into post-debate coma, read Ace's piece on the corruptions of Trumpism: 
McCormackJohn	708140750349996033	2016-03-11T04:01:26	And there were contrasts drawn--on Israel, entitlements, Cuba, Islam--without mocking Trump or directly saying Trump's an idiot.
McCormackJohn	708140229773889536	2016-03-11T03:59:22	But food fight didn't seem to be working out. Frequently have heard undecideds say his "positive vision" is what they like most about him.
McCormackJohn	708139875367829504	2016-03-11T03:57:57	Lot of conservatives seem disappointed Rubio &amp; Cruz didn't land more punches on Trump. Definitely could've drawn more contrasts...
McCormackJohn	708137134486646785	2016-03-11T03:47:04	Trump, 1 billion times: You can trust me b/c I (supposedly) self-fund. Haven’t decided whether to keep being trustworthy if I need $$.
McCormackJohn	708136799835701248	2016-03-11T03:45:44	Trump: "I beat Hillary in many of the polls that are taken"  That is just not true
McCormackJohn	708136062804172800	2016-03-11T03:42:48	Majority is a random number, says Trump. Plurality is what should count.
McCormackJohn	708137921560387584	2016-03-11T03:50:11	Donald Trump has raised $7.5 million from people not named Donald Trump:

McCormackJohn	708136508901953536	2016-03-11T03:44:34	Exactly. The same way 270 is not a random number in the Electoral College. 
McCormackJohn	708136047876706304	2016-03-11T03:42:45	Trump calls a majority "that artificial number" set by someone.
McCormackJohn	708134697604390912	2016-03-11T03:37:23	Trump encourages violence.   Denies it.   jaketapper reads backs his words encouraging violence.   Trump changes subject.   What a phony
McCormackJohn	708134057998036995	2016-03-11T03:34:50	I am at almost every Trump rally. I have yet to see a single protester start swinging as Trump just said.
McCormackJohn	708134618717937664	2016-03-11T03:37:04	I don’t think Michelle Fields thinks the Trump events are all about fun and having a good time.
McCormackJohn	708134026876461056	2016-03-11T03:34:43	Good question but doesn't Trump bear more responsibility for his campaign manager than rallygoers?
McCormackJohn	708133810462920704	2016-03-11T03:33:51	I certainly hope jaketapper follows up on this Trump rally violence question by asking about Trump's top staffer's attack on a reporter.

McCormackJohn	708131871960514560	2016-03-11T03:26:09	Trump asked about his praise of China crushing dissent and Putin. He says he was just commenting favorably on their strength.

McCormackJohn	708130371565719552	2016-03-11T03:20:11	The real reason Trump sounded weak on Cuba is that negotiating to improve the lives of Cubans is not something that would occur to him.
McCormackJohn	708128778246078464	2016-03-11T03:13:51	Yes, insisting on free elections for sanctions relief is just so dumb. Dumb dumb dumb. 
McCormackJohn	708128575539568642	2016-03-11T03:13:03	Rubio is crushing Trump on Cuba.
McCormackJohn	708129493198589952	2016-03-11T03:16:42	This is adorable.

McCormackJohn	708123713590435840	2016-03-11T02:53:44	Last week, media outraged by Rubio's attacks on Trump. This week, media bored by Rubio's thoughtful discussion of Islam, entitlements, etc.

McCormackJohn	708122760380358656	2016-03-11T02:49:57	Rubio: “I’m not interested in being politically correct. I’m interested in being correct.” good line

McCormackJohn	708118845039333376	2016-03-11T02:34:23	Cruz shouldn’t be pulling his punches on Trump.

McCormackJohn	708117525595365376	2016-03-11T02:29:08	Trump rambling on entitlements: We don't bid things out, we don't bid out the drug industry.
McCormackJohn	708117172560777216	2016-03-11T02:27:44	Rubio says Trump's "numbers don't add up" on entitlements.
McCormackJohn	708116898517536768	2016-03-11T02:26:39	The moderators attempts to correct Trump are sweet, and pointless.
McCormackJohn	708116676810637317	2016-03-11T02:25:46	I don’t know why I’m doing this, really, but here’s why Donald Trump’s argument is nonsense.
McCormackJohn	708116714702168064	2016-03-11T02:25:55	Trump said *GDP* was "zero"- whoa if true
McCormackJohn	708116513551683584	2016-03-11T02:25:07	Rubio maybe the best messenger in the GOP on entitlements. Won in Florida in 2010 running on that message when party said run away from Ryan
McCormackJohn	708115188885659648	2016-03-11T02:19:51	I guess retweeting CNN saying he's dropping out after Iowa is worse than likening him to a child molester &amp; psycho 
McCormackJohn	708114561661014016	2016-03-11T02:17:22	Tapper: What are your specific objections to Common Core? Trump: education through DC. I want to make education great.

McCormackJohn	708112298901024768	2016-03-11T02:08:22	Trump's message is that as the only one who has exploited a rigged system- be it immigration or campaign finance- he alone can fix it.
McCormackJohn	708111798784884737	2016-03-11T02:06:23	McCormackJohn He knows the issue well, having been on both sides of it.
McCormackJohn	708111686289498113	2016-03-11T02:05:56	Is that why he flip-flopped in the last debate and then reversed his comments afterward? 
McCormackJohn	708111599899377665	2016-03-11T02:05:36	Trump: I know the H1B, I know the H2B, nobody knows it better than me.
