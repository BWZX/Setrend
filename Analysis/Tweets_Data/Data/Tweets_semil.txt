semil	720361918351876097	2016-04-13T21:23:59	So, just saying, "anyone can be disrupted" like IBM etc in the past discounts the compounding benefits accrued thanks to network effects.

semil	720361410606149632	2016-04-13T21:21:58	Layered upon each other, these network effects create an uncrossable moat &amp; throw of cash to fund "other things," like wifi via balloons.
semil	720360904483676161	2016-04-13T21:19:57	Today's tech giants can't be labeled as incumbents like the old days -- the key difference is they benefit from one or more network effects.

semil	720289791317704708	2016-04-13T16:37:23	3/ LPs conduct deep referencing. Can take years to build up trust. For any new fund, budget 12-18 months, even if small. it's a LONG game.
semil	720289159378669568	2016-04-13T16:34:52	2/ If not institutional, LPs are fragmented &amp; have various divergent incentives, motivations, processes. Each process = special snowflake.

semil	698384230334668800	2016-02-13T05:52:30	krisnair I meant consumption cost re attention. The way to force better creation is to smartly introduce constraints
semil	698383813798264834	2016-02-13T05:50:51	jonrussell it can work just tougher. mainly meant mobile apps that help users create. easier to create but then harder to consume
semil	698382986836750339	2016-02-13T05:47:34	UCG for writing works b/c cost of consuming text is low; UCG for audio &amp; video tougher b/c consumption cost is higher. Production matters.
