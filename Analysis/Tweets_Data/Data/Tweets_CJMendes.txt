CJMendes	707564313326784513	2016-03-09T13:50:52	If Dolphins can manage to keep Olivier Vernon and pair him with Mario Williams...will be fun to watch.

CJMendes	707325270898900992	2016-03-08T22:01:00	davebudge  he was ridiculed by the establishment and his intelligence was questioned. My point is a non establishment candidate can win
CJMendes	707291411473895425	2016-03-08T19:46:27	davebudge I was around too Dave...
CJMendes	707291171383615488	2016-03-08T19:45:30	davebudge lol
CJMendes	707290278256906241	2016-03-08T19:41:57	Republican establishment hated Reagan too. Not to infer Trump is comparable to Reagan in any fashion, but a non establishment guy can win.
CJMendes	707279339595898880	2016-03-08T18:58:29	If Mitt Romney is not making another attempt to run for POTUS- wonder why he filed with the FEC ON 2/1/2016🤔 
CJMendes	707253991525228544	2016-03-08T17:17:46	Doesn't look like anything more than  rotation from the short term overbought sectors here.

CJMendes	706631153185378304	2016-03-07T00:02:50	davebudge I am not saying trump is the answer! I think many conservatives are turned off to the social/religious platform of today's GOP.
CJMendes	706630192899477504	2016-03-06T23:59:01	davebudge The end game is electability. The center swings elections. GOP candidates have to represent the centrists for GOP to win.

CJMendes	706590560019193860	2016-03-06T21:21:31	davebudge well that has been the problem with the Republican Party. Too narrow, too exclusive and in disarray, fragmented.
CJMendes	706589568712220672	2016-03-06T21:17:35	davebudge shooting my nose to spite my face just doesn't make sense to me. It's a two party system. Pick one and work on fixing it. IMHO
CJMendes	706587421039828994	2016-03-06T21:09:03	davebudge there in principle with you..But we need to support someone who can actually win the general election in reality not in principle

CJMendes	705841205410721793	2016-03-04T19:43:51	Cooperman was the first a few weeks back to use "growth scare" as the reason for the pullback in stocks. Agreed with him then as I do now.
CJMendes	705814391023923201	2016-03-04T17:57:18	Robertlesnicki Its ridiculous to make these prognostications of "never again" and "can't" this and that

CJMendes	689902960738959362	2016-01-20T20:10:58	We were down almost 600 today on the DOW with the VIX at 28 and change?. humm. no thanks
CJMendes	689902416519655424	2016-01-20T20:08:48	BollingShane correlation to oil remains this tight, its tough to be long equities.
CJMendes	689902221128011776	2016-01-20T20:08:01	BollingShane My point is we are not getting "paid" for the risk here. At least not yet. That could imply several things. While the +
CJMendes	689901529659240448	2016-01-20T20:05:17	Bottomline vol may still be "cheap" in my opinion. VIX should be printing 35 or so maybe a bit higher
CJMendes	689900871526805510	2016-01-20T20:02:40	You really need to look at the crude oil volatility index. We are "borrowing" that volatility but not getting compensated for it in equities
