georgemagnus1	726057129338146816	2016-04-29T14:34:43	themostocles RobertAlanWard which is good news and then bad news in that order
georgemagnus1	726057037336068096	2016-04-29T14:34:21	themostocles RobertAlanWard I wouldn't agree: think much has changed in last few months to stabilise economy thanks to vig credit surge.
georgemagnus1	726028781450829824	2016-04-29T12:42:05	chrisrigatoni truemagic68 kind of you to say. For me tho, at least,econ arg is an option I don't want to exercise. Little value right now

georgemagnus1	725989055553540096	2016-04-29T10:04:13	DrMJCole I do arguments too, eg see website material
georgemagnus1	725972535809040384	2016-04-29T08:58:35	ScepticalInvest BlakeLavak ran corrupt and self serving government more like it
georgemagnus1	725972393781514241	2016-04-29T08:58:01	BlakeLavak I think those risks v small. But if so, lots of time to pull out. Now is just self harm
georgemagnus1	725968318310535168	2016-04-29T08:41:49	BlakeLavak that's true but quite distinct and separate from EU debate
georgemagnus1	725967964021882880	2016-04-29T08:40:25	Manish_05Singh well I'd say they're old politicians who haven't emerged from their time in office.
georgemagnus1	725966794490560512	2016-04-29T08:35:46	Manish_05Singh you're listening to a different debate. Lawson and Lamont have few facts, no arguments
georgemagnus1	725966478479097856	2016-04-29T08:34:30	BlakeLavak did you ever hear about the financial crisis and the EZ response to it? Nothing to do with EU
georgemagnus1	725964765437284353	2016-04-29T08:27:42	BlakeLavak Italy is to blame for Italy's predicament, eg Berlusconi's years of vandalism, not the EU
georgemagnus1	725964506032148480	2016-04-29T08:26:40	fatwheezybloke truemagic68 I hoping so
georgemagnus1	725959523177897984	2016-04-29T08:06:52	fatwheezybloke truemagic68 my view is that it could never have been ground breaking and was illusion to think otherwise.
georgemagnus1	725959268571062273	2016-04-29T08:05:51	fatwheezybloke truemagic68 perish the thought. Let's have this one and be done

georgemagnus1	725955966181629952	2016-04-29T07:52:44	truemagic68 but Brexit arguments make it so easy and often deserved
georgemagnus1	725955092117999616	2016-04-29T07:49:16	Mario Monti is a truly class act. Been there done that, making Brexit critics look and be small thru his wisdom and knowledge
georgemagnus1	725953045360582656	2016-04-29T07:41:08	At Bloomberg this am for radio,and TV at 10.Big crowd for Brexit event w/ top ppl eg Mario Monti and not so well hinged like Lawson, Lamont

georgemagnus1	725621193395572737	2016-04-28T09:42:28	rafaelbehr it's the conflation, personalisation and exceptional criticism that give away the offenders
georgemagnus1	725617336401682433	2016-04-28T09:27:08	Gilesyb and certainly true in China that many private companies facing equiv of credit crunch while soe's still receive pref treatment
georgemagnus1	725617107480772608	2016-04-28T09:26:14	Gilesyb point taken
georgemagnus1	725610256185872384	2016-04-28T08:59:00	Gilesyb but the problem ultimately isn't high int rates but overextended bal sheets. Lower rates no more a panacea for them than for us
georgemagnus1	725608585674235904	2016-04-28T08:52:22	ChrisGiles_ apart from Minford, Bootleg and Lyons, who r the other 'influential' 5?

georgemagnus1	725583757604954113	2016-04-28T07:13:43	If Minford and Lyons are front row of 8 influential economists against Brexit, hyperbole rules ok. Tired, lost arguments

georgemagnus1	701838115573538817	2016-02-22T18:37:00	cayleylondon gist is that this discussion occurs in the abstract and so has no meaning.always trade-offs btw econ bens and sov'ty in or out
