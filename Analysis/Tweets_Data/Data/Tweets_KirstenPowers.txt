KirstenPowers	691023123991433216	2016-01-23T22:22:06	You need to explain why multiple news outlets link to that page if it never existed.   
KirstenPowers	691022891861839873	2016-01-23T22:21:10	Are you seriously suggesting that I made up that this link existed:

KirstenPowers	690603941009068033	2016-01-22T18:36:24	I'm actually pro life but thanks for proving that Ted Cruz and his supporters love to self righteously invoke bible 
KirstenPowers	690603434748305408	2016-01-22T18:34:24	Why did the tedcruz campaign take down his tax records?  Page Not Found | Cruz for President 
KirstenPowers	690603074356834304	2016-01-22T18:32:58	He's running for president.  It's my job to question him. He made Christianity a centerpiece of his campaign.  
KirstenPowers	690601197938475008	2016-01-22T18:25:30	He takes deductions.  You could see that if his campaign hadn't disabled the link to his tax returns  
KirstenPowers	690598259341922304	2016-01-22T18:13:50	I'm not saying he's not a Christian. I'm saying if he is going to claim the mantle of Christianity he might tithe 
KirstenPowers	690597659493556224	2016-01-22T18:11:27	And what I do is irrelevant any way.  I'm not running for prez claiming to represent Christianity.

KirstenPowers	690596516587646976	2016-01-22T18:06:54	When you give tens of thousands of dollars to your church or charity you deduct it, trust me.  
KirstenPowers	690596008401633280	2016-01-22T18:04:53	I did. In USA Today.  
KirstenPowers	690595821536940032	2016-01-22T18:04:09	The article is from TheAtlantic, not the USGAO 
KirstenPowers	690595567995498496	2016-01-22T18:03:08	Yes, if you present yourself as the uber-Christian candidate then people might expect that you tithe
