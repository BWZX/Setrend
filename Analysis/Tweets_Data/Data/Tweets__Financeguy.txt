_Financeguy	725041889926385665	2016-04-26T19:20:31	antonhowes well you'd hope so. But DuncanWeldon post is asking (if I interpret correctly) if that's still true? I mean evidence suggests &gt;
_Financeguy	725039577757528064	2016-04-26T19:11:20	antonhowes DuncanWeldon but if you are correct in your thesis why are there any countries that are behind the efficiency frontier at all?

_Financeguy	722517783276351489	2016-04-19T20:10:37	DuncanWeldon and that may be coz UK industry remained in UK hands. Evidence suggests that foreign ownership was key to integrating chains ?

_Financeguy	722517079035899905	2016-04-19T20:07:50	DuncanWeldon maybe lesson is that productivity of UK small biz is low coz unlike car ind, it has failed to integrate fully into

_Financeguy	722514147355832321	2016-04-19T19:56:11	DuncanWeldon really. As mentioned the soft  stuff is where the value lies. BMW are not expensive go make. They are expensive to buy

_Financeguy	722508947278688256	2016-04-19T19:35:31	DuncanWeldon look at car parts and robots - that's where the value added and jobs are. It's all integrated with Germany
_Financeguy	722505243179794433	2016-04-19T19:20:48	Guy_Stallard DuncanWeldon yes pretty key in development of UK services
_Financeguy	722504928703442944	2016-04-19T19:19:33	DuncanWeldon &gt; coz international banks shift HQs to London (Morgan Stanley was HQ'd in Paris eg) to capture share in that
_Financeguy	722504613090500608	2016-04-19T19:18:17	DuncanWeldon easy to forget that Eurodollar market ended up in London after US taxes - and city growth largely built on that &gt;
_Financeguy	722504338170626048	2016-04-19T19:17:12	DuncanWeldon depends on terms of Brexit no? Norway model probably v little. But the 'Albanian' model  could be v harmful!
_Financeguy	722503886624440321	2016-04-19T19:15:24	DuncanWeldon quite wrong imo to think that EU/Single market had no effect on productivity in key sectors impacted

_Financeguy	722501312584228864	2016-04-19T19:05:11	DuncanWeldon not sure on what basis you say that. What about say the car industry? Remember Leyland to this

_Financeguy	722494617342644224	2016-04-19T18:38:34	DuncanWeldon why?
_Financeguy	722493002791448576	2016-04-19T18:32:09	If productivity is a function of market size (a la Adam Smith) then losing access to single market reduces LT growth, no?  DuncanWeldon
