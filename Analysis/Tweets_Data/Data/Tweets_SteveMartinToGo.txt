SteveMartinToGo	721113528690741248	2016-04-15T23:10:37	Yep. I'm in.  
SteveMartinToGo	721112788337311749	2016-04-15T23:07:41	No one must tell of this secret.

SteveMartinToGo	719368074974130177	2016-04-11T03:34:48	The "whatchamacallit" is predicted but has never been found.  
SteveMartinToGo	719366634465533952	2016-04-11T03:29:05	Am I the only one who truly understands the scientific method thingy deal? 
SteveMartinToGo	719347764778385408	2016-04-11T02:14:06	Another Bright Star review!  
SteveMartinToGo	719346730785968128	2016-04-11T02:10:00	Science is exacting and precise. This feels more like a pseudo-science.  
SteveMartinToGo	719007605750898688	2016-04-10T03:42:26	Thanks Amy. I'm in Canada with the stellar Martin Short.

SteveMartinToGo	717548748356902912	2016-04-06T03:05:27	Your argument is compelling.  
SteveMartinToGo	717540772233482240	2016-04-06T02:33:46	I have only one rule when I retweet. It must not be about me, and two, it must not contain a picture of me.  
SteveMartinToGo	717163300308561923	2016-04-05T01:33:49	Where are the golf fans who shout, "Get in the hole!'

SteveMartinToGo	717140455608156161	2016-04-05T00:03:03	No, I did not write this review of Bright Star myself.   
SteveMartinToGo	716755348514861056	2016-04-03T22:32:46	And we look alike!

SteveMartinToGo	716670573800251392	2016-04-03T16:55:54	Can you imagine a young banjo player (yes, that's me with the beard) playing in front of Earl Scruggs? 
SteveMartinToGo	716648235113320449	2016-04-03T15:27:08	Yup.  
SteveMartinToGo	716059101646692352	2016-04-02T00:26:08	Searched on Amazon for "pen holders."  Got 47,000 results. Decided on this one.

SteveMartinToGo	715395174923259905	2016-03-31T04:27:55	Hey, Diane, what about me? 
SteveMartinToGo	715393256687730693	2016-03-31T04:20:18	Accidental retweet.  
SteveMartinToGo	715392952210575360	2016-03-31T04:19:05	My recollection is dim. Though I remember meeting Bowie on another occasion.  
SteveMartinToGo	715360704686063616	2016-03-31T02:10:57	A humble retweet.

SteveMartinToGo	701635442383450114	2016-02-22T05:11:39	I stand humbly corrected. Disqualified.  
SteveMartinToGo	701635148798959616	2016-02-22T05:10:29	Sorry, more correct to say "I've have excellent grammar."  
SteveMartinToGo	701634750767882240	2016-02-22T05:08:54	Your name alone qualifies you.

SteveMartinToGo	699368662986321924	2016-02-15T23:04:17	A piece of tape is much more economical, plus I don't have to buy 35 of them.  
SteveMartinToGo	699367020043837440	2016-02-15T22:57:45	I used transparent tape, which did not work so well. His idea was better.  
SteveMartinToGo	699365616088645636	2016-02-15T22:52:11	Rubber band also a solution, but looks bad to guests.  
SteveMartinToGo	699364675016859648	2016-02-15T22:48:26	I used duck tape. Not "duct" tape. Actually made from ducks.  
SteveMartinToGo	699364296074072064	2016-02-15T22:46:56	That's the old remote. I will now have to sue you for defamation.  
SteveMartinToGo	699363493762494464	2016-02-15T22:43:45	Adventures in genius: I just put a piece of tape on the back of my Apple TV remote so I can tell which end is up in the dark.
SteveMartinToGo	699362874234400769	2016-02-15T22:41:17	Hooray! You two made a great record.  
SteveMartinToGo	699304611933528064	2016-02-15T18:49:46	Nervous employee: "How do you want me to display these jeans?  Harried boss:  "BUTT OUT!" 
SteveMartinToGo	698670815991169024	2016-02-14T00:51:17	Yes. Roy Lichtenstein is a famous dish towel.  
SteveMartinToGo	698670567038263296	2016-02-14T00:50:18	Believe it or not, I bought it at Bullocks in Los Angeles. A legitimate "print" on canvas.  
SteveMartinToGo	698669979810578432	2016-02-14T00:47:58	I certainly do.  
SteveMartinToGo	698669142807834624	2016-02-14T00:44:38	It sure is.  
SteveMartinToGo	698668665462505472	2016-02-14T00:42:45	Me as young writer and banjoist. Note the Roy Lichtenstein in the upper left. A copy, sigh. 
SteveMartinToGo	698655133081722880	2016-02-13T23:48:58	Carry a baseball bat.  
SteveMartinToGo	698553344370065408	2016-02-13T17:04:30	It's getting exciting here in SteveLand.  
SteveMartinToGo	698355328740675584	2016-02-13T03:57:39	Hmm.  00/00 blood pressure combined with no reflection in mirror.
SteveMartinToGo	698350807201218560	2016-02-13T03:39:41	Current blood pressure: 00/00. YIKES!
SteveMartinToGo	698327133500923904	2016-02-13T02:05:37	Here's a video of ediebrickell and my Grammy winning song: 
SteveMartinToGo	698322659399045121	2016-02-13T01:47:50	Current blood pressure: 117/65.  
SteveMartinToGo	698321443583586305	2016-02-13T01:43:00	This reminds me of when I thought up gravitational waves (FYI, I've never taken an IQ test.).  
SteveMartinToGo	698321118541844483	2016-02-13T01:41:43	So strange to see my "younger" look. David Brenner and Gilda were special people.  
SteveMartinToGo	698182634455826433	2016-02-12T16:31:26	The gravitational wave recently identified was less than the width of a proton. Same amount of belt size I lost on my last diet.
SteveMartinToGo	697631535550357504	2016-02-11T04:01:34	Not a way to feed a child.  
SteveMartinToGo	697630615760465921	2016-02-11T03:57:54	If it had just been the potted plant, fine. But the raccoon, the child's toy, and the family in the bg ruin it.  
SteveMartinToGo	697628574111690752	2016-02-11T03:49:48	This submission makes me feel that my photo awards are not being taken seriously.  
SteveMartinToGo	697622820180881410	2016-02-11T03:26:56	Posed, not in actual combat. Problem for the awards committee.  
SteveMartinToGo	697620835910156288	2016-02-11T03:19:03	Irony does not win awards.  
SteveMartinToGo	697619514708660225	2016-02-11T03:13:48	We do not approve of salacious puns.  
SteveMartinToGo	697619124000858112	2016-02-11T03:12:14	Simply, a masterpiece. Title helps.  
SteveMartinToGo	697617598968676352	2016-02-11T03:06:11	Bad photo because of Deco railing contradicting Nouveau trees.  
SteveMartinToGo	697617082985410560	2016-02-11T03:04:08	Brilliant composition, but not award-winning because of fuzzy peak on the left in the background. 
SteveMartinToGo	697616678629326849	2016-02-11T03:02:31	Definitely award winning because of uniqueness.  
SteveMartinToGo	697616348210450432	2016-02-11T03:01:13	If I can't win an award, you can't win an award.  
SteveMartinToGo	697615504693993473	2016-02-11T02:57:52	This photo is a sad representation of what's going on in the photo community. Not award winning, but second place.  
SteveMartinToGo	697614556433096705	2016-02-11T02:54:05	Clearly, it's Uruguay. 
SteveMartinToGo	697613580447977472	2016-02-11T02:50:13	Not an award winning photo because of the lack of red and green.  
SteveMartinToGo	697612598875963392	2016-02-11T02:46:19	Too similar to this Frederic Church painting.  
SteveMartinToGo	697574903256653825	2016-02-11T00:16:31	This is clearly an award winning photograph.  
SteveMartinToGo	697542083524096000	2016-02-10T22:06:07	Better without the bridge and sky.  
SteveMartinToGo	696894483313618944	2016-02-09T03:12:47	Quitting. Can't take the heat.
SteveMartinToGo	696893744906399746	2016-02-09T03:09:51	Considering running.
SteveMartinToGo	696535189678387200	2016-02-08T03:25:04	Please don't tell me who won (watching on tape).
SteveMartinToGo	696534444543516674	2016-02-08T03:22:07	7-9 is in there somewhere.  
SteveMartinToGo	696533309652934657	2016-02-08T03:17:36	It's one's viewpoint of the score that matters. 24-10 can also be viewed as 7-9.
SteveMartinToGo	696530798929960964	2016-02-08T03:07:38	The score indicates Denver is winning, but there are so many other things to consider.
SteveMartinToGo	696493688172711937	2016-02-08T00:40:10	How dare they do a commercial without an animated inanimate object.
SteveMartinToGo	696477854486372353	2016-02-07T23:37:15	There's going to be commercials?
SteveMartinToGo	696477436498862080	2016-02-07T23:35:35	The coin flip always makes me cry.
SteveMartinToGo	696365373315272704	2016-02-07T16:10:17	I don't think it's right when they call linemen "offensive."
SteveMartinToGo	696119795767517188	2016-02-06T23:54:27	Fire. The wheel. The light bulb. The airplane, and Find my iPhone.
SteveMartinToGo	696085196966338562	2016-02-06T21:36:58	Here's a link to a display of my banjo life at the American Banjo Museum. 
SteveMartinToGo	695842880905158656	2016-02-06T05:34:05	Carl, my works were released posthumously years ago.  
SteveMartinToGo	695666628919500800	2016-02-05T17:53:43	The internal dynamic of the negative space seems very disturbing in light the critical dialogue of the 90s. 
SteveMartinToGo	695664919002357762	2016-02-05T17:46:56	This photo of "Time Standing Still" conjoined with the solitary "alarm," resonates with existential angst. 
SteveMartinToGo	695664071832690688	2016-02-05T17:43:34	More laudatory recognition coming in.  
SteveMartinToGo	695663787802824705	2016-02-05T17:42:26	Wonderful and thoughtful commentary on my exciting adventure in photography.  
SteveMartinToGo	695652823258820608	2016-02-05T16:58:52	Still waiting for the photography award. Trying again: 
SteveMartinToGo	695608063366139904	2016-02-05T14:01:00	Beautiful New York day! I'm sure to win a photography award! 
SteveMartinToGo	695028170265903104	2016-02-03T23:36:43	Here's a lovely interview with our record producer, the great Peter Asher. 
SteveMartinToGo	694669655152168961	2016-02-02T23:52:06	I can't believe they spelled "Court" wrong. 
SteveMartinToGo	694538363358027776	2016-02-02T15:10:24	"Detective, yesterday I went around town distributing my dog's hairs in the back seat of all the cars." HandyAlibis

SteveMartinToGo	694351953095192576	2016-02-02T02:49:40	My care was broken down and my Uber App malfunctioned.  
SteveMartinToGo	694310556338094082	2016-02-02T00:05:10	"Well, that cigarette butt is very interesting, but I *AAAHEW* don't smoke."
SteveMartinToGo	694309679523106816	2016-02-02T00:01:41	"I was at my doctor's at 10:12am, so there's no way I could have driven there in 14 minutes and gotten my blood taken at 10:45."
SteveMartinToGo	694308416089645056	2016-02-01T23:56:40	"I accidentally burned off my fingerprints with lye, officer. So nutty."  
SteveMartinToGo	694307308457873408	2016-02-01T23:52:16	"Unfortunately, my DNA changes daily." Alibi, just in case.
SteveMartinToGo	694186750978170880	2016-02-01T15:53:13	"Officer, I was home watching the Super Bowl. Here's the receipt for the chips."   It's always good to have a few alibis handy.
SteveMartinToGo	693854436175671296	2016-01-31T17:52:43	If you're talking about me, I don't have no masters degree in philosophy.  
SteveMartinToGo	693340432273506305	2016-01-30T07:50:15	I worked with this gentleman, Don Galvan, in 1964 at Knotts Berry Farm. At that time he played banjo.
SteveMartinToGo	692171645310652417	2016-01-27T02:25:54	Pathetic. But you qualify.  
SteveMartinToGo	692163820614242305	2016-01-27T01:54:49	So sorry that you are irrevocably qualified.  
SteveMartinToGo	692160114363604993	2016-01-27T01:40:05	So sorry that you are unqualified.  
SteveMartinToGo	692158639616999425	2016-01-27T01:34:14	You are exactly the audience we're looking for.  
SteveMartinToGo	692158174372220928	2016-01-27T01:32:23	That is so defeatist. Yet, you do not qualify.  
SteveMartinToGo	692156804961308679	2016-01-27T01:26:56	VISA stamp near the Matterhorn makes you unqualified.  
SteveMartinToGo	692155813683687424	2016-01-27T01:23:00	You can't take a pedigree on an airplane...wait. I'm thinking of hover board.  
SteveMartinToGo	692155140636278785	2016-01-27T01:20:19	Your money is not good here.  
SteveMartinToGo	692154802978045952	2016-01-27T01:18:59	Don't even go to the box office.  
SteveMartinToGo	692153758999056384	2016-01-27T01:14:50	Is "dim stars" a personal slam? 
SteveMartinToGo	692153251110785025	2016-01-27T01:12:49	If your circumstances are "dope smokin' layabout," you qualify.  
SteveMartinToGo	692152318880583680	2016-01-27T01:09:07	I'm sorry, but if you qualify, you do not qualify.  
SteveMartinToGo	692150092019671043	2016-01-27T01:00:16	You are qualified.  
SteveMartinToGo	692148763155128320	2016-01-27T00:54:59	You would qualify, had it not been for the "user fee."  
SteveMartinToGo	692148595601072128	2016-01-27T00:54:19	Sorry, you're one adjective shy.  
SteveMartinToGo	692148451157635072	2016-01-27T00:53:44	The show is in Portuguese, so you do not qualify.  
SteveMartinToGo	692147932477444098	2016-01-27T00:51:41	Marginally.  
SteveMartinToGo	692082736400613376	2016-01-26T20:32:37	Bright Star box office now open at the Cort theatre. 138 W. 48th St., New York, but only if you qualify.
SteveMartinToGo	691811730368897024	2016-01-26T02:35:44	It's great that the facility fee is included, rather than tacked on.  
SteveMartinToGo	691773023163138049	2016-01-26T00:01:55	But you won't see a show.  
SteveMartinToGo	691771364336898050	2016-01-25T23:55:20	Wow, it even knows your vocal range! 
SteveMartinToGo	691087433925038080	2016-01-24T02:37:38	I see myself! 
SteveMartinToGo	690929440252170240	2016-01-23T16:09:50	The views of Carmen Cusack singing from Bright Star doubled overnight! ediebrickell

SteveMartinToGo	690297587979665408	2016-01-21T22:19:04	This clip of Carmen Cusack singing from Bright Star is taking Broadway by storm. At least, snowstorm. 
SteveMartinToGo	690292269904048128	2016-01-21T21:57:56	DON'T DO IT!  
SteveMartinToGo	690019518383403008	2016-01-21T03:54:07	Just noticed that holiday music has suddenly vanished.
SteveMartinToGo	689824270701182976	2016-01-20T14:58:17	The views of Carmen Cusack singing this song from Bright Star keep growing!  ediebrickell
SteveMartinToGo	689645690851594240	2016-01-20T03:08:40	Thank you Johnny Baier for this lovely interview about bluegrass and the 5-string. 
SteveMartinToGo	689617693163536384	2016-01-20T01:17:25	Pride swelleth within me.  
SteveMartinToGo	689616610949206016	2016-01-20T01:13:07	Am I allowed to be proud, or must I remain subdued?  "BrightStarBway: Our BRIGHT STAR rises at the Cort Theatre ‚Ä¶"
SteveMartinToGo	689598472018853888	2016-01-20T00:01:02	As a person of gender, I am offended. "JohnCleese: I find my tweets tonight are inhibited by my fear of giving offence to people of gender"
SteveMartinToGo	689254103885688832	2016-01-19T01:12:38	Uh oh. Amazon drone just repossessed my blood pressure cuff.
SteveMartinToGo	689252524885446656	2016-01-19T01:06:22	117/63. You're asking, "Why does Steve have a blood pressure cuff?" Answer: Amazon.
SteveMartinToGo	689251721982423040	2016-01-19T01:03:10	Tragedy.  
SteveMartinToGo	689249416662925312	2016-01-19T00:54:01	Current blood pressure: 115/58.
SteveMartinToGo	689248197005459456	2016-01-19T00:49:10	I'm a stylist.  
SteveMartinToGo	689246971140386816	2016-01-19T00:44:18	I prefer to be corrected. And everyone should. At least for the record.  
SteveMartinToGo	689230089259773952	2016-01-18T23:37:13	That's what I prefer.  
SteveMartinToGo	689229492338962433	2016-01-18T23:34:50	Glenn once asked me "what do you think of the name 'Eagles?'" I said "The Eagles. Great."  He said "no, Eagles." The group is "Eagles."
SteveMartinToGo	689226710517153792	2016-01-18T23:23:47	Thank you.  
SteveMartinToGo	689226638807183361	2016-01-18T23:23:30	MT: Shocker. My friend from the early days, and important member of Eagles, has died.  We loved you,  Glenn Frey.

SteveMartinToGo	688902159086317569	2016-01-18T01:54:08	No more kids in the cast. So sad that they need "nurturing" and "education." 
SteveMartinToGo	688833557431758848	2016-01-17T21:21:32	Producer called, said to qualify you must have IQ above "dim bulbus."
SteveMartinToGo	688828844216832000	2016-01-17T21:02:48	Please check the website. I don't know all the by-laws.  
SteveMartinToGo	688828386899324928	2016-01-17T21:00:59	If you are overqualified, you may bring a guest.  
SteveMartinToGo	688828065397497856	2016-01-17T20:59:43	You are qualified.  
SteveMartinToGo	688827877396221952	2016-01-17T20:58:58	If you are unqualified, you must remain unqualified until you qualify.  
SteveMartinToGo	688827370992758784	2016-01-17T20:56:57	In order to qualify, you must first qualify.
SteveMartinToGo	688826989336203264	2016-01-17T20:55:26	If it were reversed, yes.  
SteveMartinToGo	688826795404226561	2016-01-17T20:54:40	You are qualified.  
SteveMartinToGo	688826571818405888	2016-01-17T20:53:47	You qualify for an impaired view seat.  
SteveMartinToGo	688826104606502912	2016-01-17T20:51:55	Simply put, "money" does not make you qualified.  
SteveMartinToGo	688825598450491393	2016-01-17T20:49:55	I'm sorry. You do not qualify.  
SteveMartinToGo	688821197212114945	2016-01-17T20:32:25	You can get tickets here for our musical Bright Star, opening on Broadway soon. If you qualify. 
SteveMartinToGo	687423357323730945	2016-01-13T23:57:54	Our photos were taken in the 70s.
