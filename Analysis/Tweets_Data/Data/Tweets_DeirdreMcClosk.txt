DeirdreMcClosk	718829872601280514	2016-04-09T15:56:11	ayjay Good.  I agree with your Edmund Wilson checklist!  But how am I to find your email?

DeirdreMcClosk	369587346821238784	2013-08-19T22:31:04	arikaokrent  The word belief is said to derive from  love, meaning commitment, not propositional belief.  True, or hopelessly obscure?
DeirdreMcClosk	369586443305226241	2013-08-19T22:27:29	arikaokrent  Dear Akira,  You are amazing!  Your Dad forwarded the link to your site.  Wow!

DeirdreMcClosk	364492888664571905	2013-08-05T21:07:31	via Forbes Fred Smith: We're In a Cultural War Between the Forces of Economic Dynamism and Stasis 
DeirdreMcClosk	341632706284777473	2013-06-03T19:09:19	The outline of The Treasured Bourgeoisie is up on .  I use Tocqueville's trick of declarative chapter titles.
DeirdreMcClosk	341629630765215747	2013-06-03T18:57:05	In 1492, if you knew somehow that the Great Enrichment as going to happen, you would bet rationally on China.  Not the pathetic Europeans.
DeirdreMcClosk	341629426632630272	2013-06-03T18:56:17	It is no deep European superiority, no tendencies stretching back into the Middle Ages, that explains why Europe rather than China won.
DeirdreMcClosk	341629234986487808	2013-06-03T18:55:31	What cause dignity and liberty for commoners?  Accidents of European history in the 16th and 17th centuries, which made people bold.
DeirdreMcClosk	341629051405996032	2013-06-03T18:54:47	What caused innovation?  Dignity and liberty for the common people, and particular the middle class.  Hierarchy loosened, 1600-1848
DeirdreMcClosk	341628575075692544	2013-06-03T18:52:54	Markets and maximizing are not new, and can't explain the the Great Enrichment, Only innovation can, a la Kirzner and Mokyr..
DeirdreMcClosk	341628304173961216	2013-06-03T18:51:49	New word for capitalism?  The best I can come up with is "market-tested innovation and supply."  Pretty clumsy, eh?  But every word counts.
DeirdreMcClosk	341628109277257728	2013-06-03T18:51:03	We need a new word for "capitalism."  The old one keeps driving us to think that piling brick on brick, or BA on BA, did it.
DeirdreMcClosk	341627838312620032	2013-06-03T18:49:58	The Great Enrichment is the rise of real income per head since 1800, 30 times---that's 2900%, class.  Investing and exploiting can't cause.
DeirdreMcClosk	341626563273572352	2013-06-03T18:44:54	Art Carden, columnist for Forbes, and I are writing a (we hope) popular book on the theme of the trilogy of The Bourgeois Era. Wish us rich!
DeirdreMcClosk	341626000423141377	2013-06-03T18:42:40	The 3rd vol is called The Treasured Bourgeoisie: How Markets and Innovation Became Ethical, 1600-1848, and Then Suspect.  Order early!!
DeirdreMcClosk	341625397504528384	2013-06-03T18:40:16	While I get my hip joints replaced in July I'll finish The Bourgeois Era, the third and final volume. And get a Boxed Set, and die happy!
DeirdreMcClosk	341625061708558336	2013-06-03T18:38:56	Crossing, about my transition from Donald, is free June for download at the U of Chicago Press.  Mom: "Don't do anything more interesting"!
DeirdreMcClosk	341624444097290241	2013-06-03T18:36:29	Dears:  I finally remembered my password, so I'm back being active again!  Stupid, eh?
DeirdreMcClosk	313109619209801728	2013-03-17T02:08:45	The Master: “Accumulate, accumulate!  That is Moses and the prophets.”  No.  Ideas, images, ethics, metaphors, stories.  Not K but ? &amp; !
DeirdreMcClosk	313108470025056256	2013-03-17T02:04:11	That we insist on ruminating on something called “capital” does not mean that its accumulation was in fact unique to modernity.
DeirdreMcClosk	313108194018852864	2013-03-17T02:03:05	Wallerstein: “capitalism is . . . from capital.  It would be legitimate therefore to presume that capital is a key element."  No.
DeirdreMcClosk	313107033073283072	2013-03-17T01:58:28	"Capitalism" is a misleading word, making us think that "K" (physical or human) must be central.  What does accumulate is savoir faire.
DeirdreMcClosk	313106413327106048	2013-03-17T01:56:00	Capital depreciates, rather rapidly, whether a house or a woman (I'm telling you!).  It can't accumulate over centuries, so can't explain us
DeirdreMcClosk	313104990413668352	2013-03-17T01:50:21	Next week in Barcelona at UPF &amp; the UAB , in Madrid at CREI  then back to Barcelona at ESADE.  Spaniards will know what the acronyms mean!
DeirdreMcClosk	313103823969337344	2013-03-17T01:45:43	Spoke at Prairie Lights and at the Project on Rhetoric of Inquiry in Iowa City.  Spring in Town is not its best, but I weep at sweet Iowa.
