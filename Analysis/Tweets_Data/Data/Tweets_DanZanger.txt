DanZanger	718036830424338432	2016-04-07T11:24:55	PennyTradingNet mnycx  I block negative people.  I can make more in a single day trading than the profits of my site for years.
DanZanger	717853303078391808	2016-04-06T23:15:39	This video is a MUST to understand my site and method 
DanZanger	717852572548210689	2016-04-06T23:12:45	I watch traders excited about catching $6 on a TSLA but they used a $6 stop. This is trading for peanuts and a future of drawdowns
DanZanger	717851964579700736	2016-04-06T23:10:20	ModDarvasBox It's a mix. I have amazing traders in my room discussing setups. Best to try both. Today they nailed VRX - not in my letter

DanZanger	717847165893095425	2016-04-06T22:51:15	You can't chase a LABU up 10% and expect to consistently make money swing trading . It's all about stalking the proper entry
DanZanger	717846754750664705	2016-04-06T22:49:37	You wil never make big money trying to jump into the big movers. Members who follow the process daily catch these huge gains with small risk

DanZanger	717755698667331585	2016-04-06T16:47:48	If you think you are going to consistently buy the low and sell the high you are dreaming. That's not what trading is about   $$

DanZanger	690587598885122049	2016-01-22T17:31:28	BagelWar I am sorry to say but that is the "WORST" mistake you can make. You must make small adjustments once you have a proven method.
DanZanger	690584012738338817	2016-01-22T17:17:13	The rookie takes 2 trades that are small losses, then skips the next entry which goes on to be the big winner. Emotional trading errors
DanZanger	690581735076016129	2016-01-22T17:08:10	Some of your best entry points will still lead to a small loss due to probabilities. Your not a trader until you can truly accept this!
DanZanger	690581525964787712	2016-01-22T17:07:20	I did not hit the World Record for being "right" in the markets. I did it trading small risk for big gains.
DanZanger	690581063760945153	2016-01-22T17:05:30	Rookies are shocked by a losing trade but small losses can't be avoided. Big winners are the answer to being wrong more often,.
