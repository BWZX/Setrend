KaiserKuo	725957341124796420	2016-04-29T07:58:12	imontheradio It's true, I'm heading home—and inspired by y'all I'm hoping to start some radio magazine-style podcasting with Sinica.
KaiserKuo	725892701640491009	2016-04-29T03:41:21	gonglei89 Kenan, Naruto, Fairy Tail, Attack on Titan, Chobits, lots of others whose names I've forgotten.
KaiserKuo	725890071140823040	2016-04-29T03:30:54	gonglei89 Sure, for Chinese-language searches. Plus my daughter has her own Tieba, on which she writes her Manga/Anime-based fan fic.
KaiserKuo	725888497270312960	2016-04-29T03:24:38	A parting gift. The kids are even bigger boosters of the company and than I am. They'll love it! 
KaiserKuo	725873822348533760	2016-04-29T02:26:19	Can't believe it's my last day at Baidu. We're up ~$8 in after-hours trading after Q1 earnings, so going out on a high note! Adieu, Baidu!
KaiserKuo	725846840327950337	2016-04-29T00:39:06	tickerreport No, we beat EPS expectations. You just didn't convert RMB to USD.
KaiserKuo	725846553915695104	2016-04-29T00:37:58	wkrbnews No, BIDU beat expectations. You just didn't convert RMB to USD.
KaiserKuo	725846094941401088	2016-04-29T00:36:09	Seems like every damn quarter I have to correct bad reporting that says BIDU missed on EPS because they don't convert RMB to USD. Duh!
KaiserKuo	725841860351156224	2016-04-29T00:19:19	jsomaney The podcast I've been hosting as a hobby since 2010 was recently acquired, and I'll be doing that full-time in North Carolina.
KaiserKuo	725821753382047744	2016-04-28T22:59:25	jsomaney Hey thanks Jay. My last day at Baidu. Nice note to go out on!

KaiserKuo	725613558872952832	2016-04-28T09:12:08	gaowhen Yes, I'm leaving China just a few days after the concert.

KaiserKuo	725568092038926336	2016-04-28T06:11:28	fryan Interesting move. Was just recommending the show to a colleague, a Linedelof fan. Two excellent seasons so far!

KaiserKuo	725207201841709056	2016-04-27T06:17:25	My approach to the position of 百度蛮夷谎言消解大臣 was one of 以夷治夷 （"Using Barbarians to Control Barbarians"). I am after all a barbarian!
KaiserKuo	725200759843905536	2016-04-27T05:51:49	rob_schmitz Yeah, true, I should hold onto this—and just swap a Sinica logo for the Baidu paw.
KaiserKuo	725197572151730176	2016-04-27T05:39:09	I'm going to miss having this title. Last day is Friday. Real expertise in barbarian lie-suppression is so rare now. 
KaiserKuo	724887605544890368	2016-04-26T09:07:27	weigu Thanks, that's very sweet of you!

KaiserKuo	720807726763278337	2016-04-15T02:55:28	prchovanec jamesLmcgregor Pretty sure he started with ass-fucking and worked backward.
KaiserKuo	720782058210115584	2016-04-15T01:13:28	prchovanec I haven't told my boy about the Reformation yet because I'm still running a scam on him, selling him indulgences.
KaiserKuo	720148316927844354	2016-04-13T07:15:13	mattsheehan88 I'm sure you were an instant hit, and the object of many an instant crush! Get used to it.
KaiserKuo	719789879828160512	2016-04-12T07:30:55	klustout larsonchristina Really looking forward to this one!!
KaiserKuo	719764531602460672	2016-04-12T05:50:11	Tomoo_Terada Not familiar with that Patty Duke controversy, sorry. Link me?

KaiserKuo	719319707661266944	2016-04-11T00:22:37	going2peace Thanks! My chief concern is that overblowing tiny transgressions like this will cause people to dismiss real issues that arise.
KaiserKuo	719106972243640320	2016-04-10T10:17:17	gedawei And broccoli's been ubiquitous in China—in Beijing, at least—since the early 1990s.
KaiserKuo	719020920166301697	2016-04-10T04:35:20	prchovanec But it's completely consistent with the Chinese food approach. My folks made it all the time. Basic meat+veggie stir-fry.
KaiserKuo	718273818729586688	2016-04-08T03:06:37	KnowingCoves I've actually been following it closely, and yes there's plenty of anti-Chinese/anti-Asian racism. But this is crying wolf.
KaiserKuo	718267359660752896	2016-04-08T02:40:57	GinaApostol Well good, at least that's consistent.
KaiserKuo	718267067535912960	2016-04-08T02:39:48	KnowingCoves And what, I'm not entitled to an opinion on whether it's racist? I call it "not miscalibrated." Fuck what "most" say.
KaiserKuo	718266593025900544	2016-04-08T02:37:55	KnowingCoves Be as bothered as you want. I'm listening, just not finding the fault that others are finding. Dig?
KaiserKuo	718244444626120709	2016-04-08T01:09:54	KnowingCoves Criticize it all you want for its meter, mechanics (keeping in mind it's deliberate doggerel). But it's not racist.
KaiserKuo	718244123807977476	2016-04-08T01:08:38	ProleArtThreat Hey thanks!
KaiserKuo	718100954013437952	2016-04-07T15:39:43	rks483 Yeah, that's what I would have thought. Puzzled, utterly baffled by the outraged responses.
KaiserKuo	718089225674047488	2016-04-07T14:53:07	NotMattBellamy Absolutely. Well said.
KaiserKuo	718089113237327872	2016-04-07T14:52:40	vtlen Indeed it boggles. I have a feeling that I may be in for some surprises during re-entry into American life after 20 years in Beijing.
KaiserKuo	717916856753987584	2016-04-07T03:28:11	SandyHendry Yeah I'm sure I'll get called out on that at some point, the way things are going.
KaiserKuo	717914494287147009	2016-04-07T03:18:48	niubi I thought it was actually kind of clever, better than I could do.
KaiserKuo	717911716802256897	2016-04-07T03:07:46	stinson Well put. That's exactly what it is.
KaiserKuo	717909283069890560	2016-04-07T02:58:05	BeijingPalmer And much of the time I understand it. But this—being prickly about something so innocuous—weakens the case when it matters
KaiserKuo	717908887899414529	2016-04-07T02:56:31	Do I get a pass for this equally silly (and not 1/2 as clever) bit of doggerel just because I'm ethnically Chinese? 
KaiserKuo	717908191930138624	2016-04-07T02:53:45	I hontestly can't fathom why some Chinese-Americans take such affront at Calvin Trillin's Chinese food poem. 
KaiserKuo	717522289428983809	2016-04-06T01:20:19	dktatlow Yeah, with Sixth Sense they could have gone with a motto like "The digital, English China news site that sees dead people."

KaiserKuo	709991796475105280	2016-03-16T06:36:49	shit_taste Nor does China glorify a national past. No efforts to reconstitute empire; still sees its imperial past as feudal, backward.
KaiserKuo	709991481721880577	2016-03-16T06:35:34	shit_taste The level of social mobilization is nothing compared to fascist states of mid-20th century, and nationalist fervor pales too.
KaiserKuo	709991033506029568	2016-03-16T06:33:48	shit_taste You've clearly made up your mind, but I think to call it fascist is loaded and severely waters down the definition of fascist.

KaiserKuo	708935593888186368	2016-03-13T08:39:51	shit_taste No. Fascism involves total militarization of society, glorification of a national  past. China doesn't even have conscription.
KaiserKuo	706118021446836224	2016-03-05T14:03:50	BethanyAllenEbr Thanks, guess that opinion didn't exactly come across in your FP piece. I responded on Parlio.

KaiserKuo	702178168589971456	2016-02-23T17:08:15	shishiqiushi Yeah I'd say that was certainly true at least until recently; CCP not doing much to earn credibility of late with media.
KaiserKuo	702176699497259009	2016-02-23T17:02:25	shishiqiushi Certainly the "western media" is harder on its own several governments, at least when they're doing the job right.
KaiserKuo	702175148921597952	2016-02-23T16:56:15	Mcb18125448 Actually I think they're pretty ubiquitous. Can't throw a rock in Haidian District without hitting one, no?

KaiserKuo	699990132808667136	2016-02-17T16:13:47	brigantine72 Well, sort of—that crosses into horror for sure, but Witching Hour and the other Lasher books I'd count.
KaiserKuo	699987372453322753	2016-02-17T16:02:49	Just successfully explained the genre of Southern Gothic to my (Chinese) wife. Had never really thought about what constituted it.

KaiserKuo	690759736287989760	2016-01-23T04:55:29	farwestchina No, "incitement" is ostensibly just posts/writings/speech; actual "subverting" is actual organization. Not ethnic distinction.
KaiserKuo	690707066600685569	2016-01-23T01:26:12	farwestchina Actually the charge was incitement to subvert state power; charge of subversion is much worse.

KaiserKuo	688887538455580673	2016-01-18T00:56:02	samliaoacademic Beijing still obviously regards residents of Taiwan as Chinese, and it's Beijing that needs persuading.

KaiserKuo	688738056963248128	2016-01-17T15:02:03	PhelimKine We can all hope so. At least it should permanently destroy essentialist nonsense about Chinese being incapable of democracy.
