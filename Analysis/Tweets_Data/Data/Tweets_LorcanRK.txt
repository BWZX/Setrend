LorcanRK	706116808802172928	2016-03-05T13:59:00	jeuasommenulle IvanTheK So increasing T2 is better than the alternative in a situation where the interbank market is borked
LorcanRK	706116637028646912	2016-03-05T13:58:19	jeuasommenulle IvanTheK :) yes, but a broken interbank market is only becomes a real problem if there is no other source of liquidity
LorcanRK	706115721210806272	2016-03-05T13:54:41	IvanTheK :) T2 balances going up (a) upsets the Germans and (b) mean everyone is getting all the liquidity they need. All good things.
LorcanRK	706114992974782465	2016-03-05T13:51:47	IvanTheK for eg, here's the ecb compared with bundesbank 
LorcanRK	706114566732828672	2016-03-05T13:50:06	IvanTheK Nothing at all. Also (important note) that chart is the ecb alone, not the eurosystem. ie it is the tiny bit that is not the NCBs
LorcanRK	706113370735435779	2016-03-05T13:45:21	IvanTheK + Then there would be a drop in T2 balances, even though liquidity allocation increased, as greater Ger usage would balance system
LorcanRK	706112915678613505	2016-03-05T13:43:32	IvanTheK kinda.. but it's more complicated than that as allocation across NCBs is critical. So, for eg if Ger saw a huge increase in T2 use
LorcanRK	706110360202420224	2016-03-05T13:33:23	IvanTheK Not sure I understand? There are constantly T2 claims/liabilities atm as the ecb is still doing full allocation liquidity ops.
