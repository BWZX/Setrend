SamHarrisOrg	684565451381145600	2016-01-06T02:41:36	david_a_garcia Well, one reason is that I don't think Sanders has a chance in the general election.

SamHarrisOrg	684254549947764736	2016-01-05T06:06:12	snowwhitejrm I think he could win the nomination. I just don't think he could win the general election.

SamHarrisOrg	684215171758198784	2016-01-05T03:29:43	snowwhitejrm I think he has a near zero chance of getting elected.
SamHarrisOrg	684213952545296384	2016-01-05T03:24:53	beachvetlbc DavidMcKee41 I have done both. And sometimes it is necessary to do both.

SamHarrisOrg	684137726073950208	2016-01-04T22:21:59	cosmos4u michaelshermer You'll have to listen to the podcast to understand. 
SamHarrisOrg	684137098933186560	2016-01-04T22:19:29	Revaelis He has, on at least one occasion, publicly wished me dead. So there's that small point of difference between us.... :)

SamHarrisOrg	682666225151774721	2015-12-31T20:54:46	Joshdecks His treatment of Steve is shameful. And he's targeted me in exactly the same terms in the past (and in all caps).

SamHarrisOrg	682457048898908160	2015-12-31T07:03:34	nntaleb You, of all people, are claiming that scientific thinking must be confined to academic journals?
