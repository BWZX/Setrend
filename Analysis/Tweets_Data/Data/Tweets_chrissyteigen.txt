chrissyteigen	702750238969167872	2016-02-25T07:01:28	ok done!
chrissyteigen	702750169004048384	2016-02-25T07:01:11	you'd be surprised at how many people you know go through this. also every doctor knows the sex of the embryos, it isn't some grand secret.
chrissyteigen	702749484497764352	2016-02-25T06:58:28	we didn't "throw away" anything and still would love to have more of both in the future. hard to explain such a complicated process here.
chrissyteigen	702749237163880448	2016-02-25T06:57:29	we didn't create a little girl. we had multiple embryos. girls and boys. we simply chose to put in a female first (and second)...
chrissyteigen	702749017734709248	2016-02-25T06:56:36	from reading everything tonight, i think i made a mistake in thinking people understood the process better than they do, which is my fault..
chrissyteigen	702692498200616961	2016-02-25T03:12:01	callahan_deej97 THAT IS DISGUSTING

chrissyteigen	702566630669176832	2016-02-24T18:51:52	Pepperthai2 i can give out your number here if you want
chrissyteigen	702565068693594112	2016-02-24T18:45:40	maddiexroarr saltshul just one at a time. i think if i were older I would have done 2 or 3 at a time but I was confident it would work.
chrissyteigen	702564853009903616	2016-02-24T18:44:48	one1man_WOLFpak nope it's still all us! we just had trouble with the timing and needed some help making the two meet. (tmi?? yes)
chrissyteigen	702563320000225281	2016-02-24T18:38:43	isabelcontin &lt;3 I didn't know much before it all!
chrissyteigen	702563182485774336	2016-02-24T18:38:10	saltshul yes. and not all survive. so you're kind of left with the strongest. it's fascinating and wonderful.
chrissyteigen	702562117551960064	2016-02-24T18:33:56	so many typos, my apologies. pretty under the weather. probably this darn science baby.
chrissyteigen	702561038152019968	2016-02-24T18:29:39	anyhow I am not mad at anyone's beliefs but I don't really actively seek out people to make them feel bad about their decisions either.
chrissyteigen	702560854286299136	2016-02-24T18:28:55	This is all so interesting. I said it so casually because i'm just open. I'm around so many open-minded people &amp; forgot it's controversial.
chrissyteigen	702560317394415617	2016-02-24T18:26:47	what is that difference though? i've already created embryos with a doctor. only after must it be random?  
chrissyteigen	702559997805236226	2016-02-24T18:25:31	TravisSpates they tell you "hey, we were able to make 10 embryos. 6 girls, 4 boys. would you like to choose what goes in or do at random?"
chrissyteigen	702559660142768129	2016-02-24T18:24:10	JQFrench :) you're welcome!!
chrissyteigen	702559334354386944	2016-02-24T18:22:52	JQFrench you kind of just cut out the part where the sperm has to swim to the egg and fertilize it. it's all done with a little help by man
chrissyteigen	702559055353503745	2016-02-24T18:21:46	JQFrench you make an embryo (outside) from a sperm/egg (fertilization) then it goes back in me and hopefully "takes" aka I get pregnant.
chrissyteigen	702558472882139136	2016-02-24T18:19:27	catvoncat lol
chrissyteigen	702557258631114752	2016-02-24T18:14:37	I also picked the embryo with a taste for bacon, a knack for magic and size 7 feet so she can always find shoes
chrissyteigen	702556069332029441	2016-02-24T18:09:54	What year is this!? And for the record, I am always happy and open to speak on infertility. The more casual, the better! I don't mind.
chrissyteigen	702555472482557953	2016-02-24T18:07:32	last tweet is referring to this:

chrissyteigen	701259558912561154	2016-02-21T04:18:02	JonWarech wouldn't have said anything if it were the more recent tweet of the best advice. There is a way to write things but u guys...
chrissyteigen	701258326961573888	2016-02-21T04:13:08	JonWarech I said I said it. And now I see how you guys wanna play. So I'm not playing anymore.
chrissyteigen	701258078193233924	2016-02-21T04:12:09	JonWarech you don't get what I am saying. I am not gonna let someone play the click bait game without calling them out.
chrissyteigen	701257362540081152	2016-02-21T04:09:18	mat0915 you have NO idea what I am utilizing the nurse for. She isn't solely taking care of her or stealing "precious time"
chrissyteigen	701256939150245888	2016-02-21T04:07:37	krisyhead JonWarech mainly because i like Us and they don't need to pull that shit. They know most are gonna read the tweet and reply.
chrissyteigen	701256554859753472	2016-02-21T04:06:06	krisyhead JonWarech usweekly better. and obviously I get the game. my fault for saying it at all but needed express my disappointment.
chrissyteigen	701254601853382656	2016-02-21T03:58:20	JonWarech my point is the tweet written was meant to start shit. And it did. Success. I will just be more mindful and protective, as said.
chrissyteigen	701252093596737536	2016-02-21T03:48:22	JonWarech whoever wrote this knew it would stir up some shit. and that is what I wrote back to. 
chrissyteigen	701251371882811392	2016-02-21T03:45:30	JonWarech read the title of the tweet sent out and the title of the article.
chrissyteigen	701236576005652480	2016-02-21T02:46:42	I will miss Jeb! and his constant confusion. I believe he has a good heart. But that may just be his constant look of confusion.
chrissyteigen	701235336265924609	2016-02-21T02:41:47	and i feel like no one knows not to say this
