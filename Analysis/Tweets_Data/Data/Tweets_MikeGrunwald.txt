MikeGrunwald	708339163213340672	2016-03-11T17:09:51	"America can't fix the climate by itself" is an excellent argument for the Paris climate deal.
MikeGrunwald	708304715558330369	2016-03-11T14:52:58	Imagine media reaction if unemployment fell below 5% under President Romney and Ds argued what really matters is "labor participation rate."

MikeGrunwald	708007779693436928	2016-03-10T19:13:03	vermontgmg aw thanks.
MikeGrunwald	708000965341921280	2016-03-10T18:45:58	18. He just wishes Americans would accept the stuff we can't fix. And remember what happens when we try. END
MikeGrunwald	708000427711852544	2016-03-10T18:43:50	17. Basically, Obama has come around to the Serenity Prayer.
MikeGrunwald	708000224799752192	2016-03-10T18:43:02	17. Obviously, Syria is a disaster. The question is whether there was some magical solution that would have avoided disaster.
MikeGrunwald	707999710674554880	2016-03-10T18:40:59	16. But Obama thinks stuff like the opening to Cuba and TPP and the global climate deal and even the Iran nukes deal are huge.
MikeGrunwald	707999468273209344	2016-03-10T18:40:01	15. Is staying out of intractable messes a foreign policy? I don't know. Like I said, I'm not an expert.
MikeGrunwald	707999143239794688	2016-03-10T18:38:44	14. Obamaworld is also proud of the 1000 soldiers who aren't getting killed every year, the bodies &amp; minds that aren't getting ravaged.
MikeGrunwald	707998149273583616	2016-03-10T18:34:47	13. As Jeff showed, Obama is pretty proud of the stupid shit he hasn't done. He thinks the media stokes demand for stupid shit-doing.
MikeGrunwald	707997816560427008	2016-03-10T18:33:28	12. Republican debates are terrible, too, because the candidates act like "toughness" will fix problems, a recipe for another Iraq war.
MikeGrunwald	707997520157413376	2016-03-10T18:32:17	11. Terror attacks are especially terrible, not just because they're tragic, but because they ratchet up demand for another Iraq war.
MikeGrunwald	707992531477393408	2016-03-10T18:12:28	10. He likes working on Asia and Latin America and the climate. But then...the fucking Middle East! Again? What is it this time? Damn!
MikeGrunwald	707991498529349633	2016-03-10T18:08:21	9. Obama now has a bifurcated view of the world: The Middle East, which sucks, and everywhere else, where cool stuff can be achieved.
MikeGrunwald	707990928628322304	2016-03-10T18:06:05	8. And what about Obama's role in ousting Mubarak? They kind of regret that too.
MikeGrunwald	707990611660509184	2016-03-10T18:04:50	7. So what about Libya, one might ask? They kind of wish they had stayed out of Libya.
MikeGrunwald	707990342281392128	2016-03-10T18:03:46	6. Basically, they see the Middle East as an unfixable mess and US intervention there as a recipe for another quagmire.
MikeGrunwald	707989909903114241	2016-03-10T18:02:02	5. I guess you're not supposed to overlearn the lessons of the last war, but Obamaworld seems to filter EVERYTHING through Iraq.
MikeGrunwald	707989641815793664	2016-03-10T18:00:59	4. The driving philosophy is even simpler than Don't Do Stupid Shit. It's Don't Do the Fucking Iraq War.
MikeGrunwald	707986982081847297	2016-03-10T17:50:24	3. But it was illuminating! Because as complex as Obama can be-Jeff drew this out beautifully-his aides translate his ideas pretty simply.
MikeGrunwald	707985781328125954	2016-03-10T17:45:38	2. Unlike my pal Jeff, I had zero access to Obama. And unlike Jeff, I am a foreign policy idiot. So I got the dumbed-down version.
MikeGrunwald	707985137330421760	2016-03-10T17:43:05	1. You should read JeffreyGoldberg's nuanced opus on Obama's foreign policy. But if you want a simpler version...I did a bit of reporting.

MikeGrunwald	707576381173923842	2016-03-09T14:38:50	ezraklein Sure. But Cruz is the policy antidote. Trump is the temperamental/cultural antidote. He's no-no-drama.

MikeGrunwald	707566555828068352	2016-03-09T13:59:47	This is a plausible theory. Another is that Americans almost always think the country is on the wrong track. 
MikeGrunwald	707561802696040448	2016-03-09T13:40:54	So the public overwhelmingly thought the ship was off track, and overwhelmingly reelected the captain two months later. Someone explain?
MikeGrunwald	707560185603043332	2016-03-09T13:34:28	Odd: Today, only 28% thinks US is on the right track. Odder: In August 2012, only 28% thought US was on right track.

MikeGrunwald	707276591622180864	2016-03-08T18:47:34	I won't rant. I'll just suggest HotlineJosh should read Chapter 7 of my book on the DC Republican strategy.

MikeGrunwald	706969118591881221	2016-03-07T22:25:47	Bloomberg cares about climate, which is why he was never going to run &amp; help elect an R, which is why I ignored the talk of him running.

MikeGrunwald	705519645751697408	2016-03-03T22:26:06	Trump didn't say let ISIS take over Syria; he said let others take out ISIS. Mitt really needed to gild this lily? 
MikeGrunwald	705454752696549377	2016-03-03T18:08:14	my only chance. 
MikeGrunwald	705439126057852933	2016-03-03T17:06:08	The time for Mitt to speak up was when his party trashed his health care plan as a job-killing socialist abomination.

MikeGrunwald	705159693510033408	2016-03-02T22:35:46	I heard there was interest in Judge Kelly. But WH worried about "monsters" she may have repped as public defender. 
MikeGrunwald	705069717535531008	2016-03-02T16:38:14	I had forgotten the GOP ads about ISIS smuggling Ebola across the Mexican border. Gee, how did Trump happen? 
MikeGrunwald	705033440253632512	2016-03-02T14:14:05	This sentence I wrote in May 2011 (about the GOP’s tense relationship with reality) held up pretty well. 
MikeGrunwald	705027385780019200	2016-03-02T13:50:02	Keep America Great is acceptable. Make America Even Greater is clunky but OK. But if Hillary agrees America isn't great, hi President Trump.
MikeGrunwald	704894862458560514	2016-03-02T05:03:26	This has been going around a lot and is worth a read tonight  
MikeGrunwald	704853530583113728	2016-03-02T02:19:11	Here's my tweetstorm on DC Republicans. Funny how candidates they hate have won every primary so far. 
MikeGrunwald	704800234296233984	2016-03-01T22:47:25	Cantor &amp; McConnell devised the Party of No strategy I tweetstormed about today; Chapter 7 of my book tells how: 
MikeGrunwald	704760752528293888	2016-03-01T20:10:31	KevinWGlass you're probably right. i should think more about your original question.
MikeGrunwald	704760297983242242	2016-03-01T20:08:43	KevinWGlass could argue either way! my point is that gop choices of last 7 (maybe 15) years led to your current unpalatable choice.
MikeGrunwald	704759424708173824	2016-03-01T20:05:15	KevinWGlass Also, hughhewitt's argument for Trump - keeping the Court is important - is not necessarily unprincipled.
MikeGrunwald	704759177160347648	2016-03-01T20:04:16	KevinWGlass Depends who you're talking about, right? For some losing party means losing power.
MikeGrunwald	704758646480236544	2016-03-01T20:02:09	KevinWGlass Great question. Many elite GOPers are principled conservatives. Wouldn't they fear Trump win still means losing their party?
MikeGrunwald	704757128049905664	2016-03-01T19:56:07	Here's the already-storified version of my Republican tweetstorm.  via demfromct
MikeGrunwald	704756720367759360	2016-03-01T19:54:30	jimtankersley I think that's overthinking their motives. Strategy wasn't about policy. It was about gaining and maintaining seats/power.
MikeGrunwald	704754922949058560	2016-03-01T19:47:22	jimtankersley I'd say more conservative on stuff Obama got done, less on guns, immigration, stuff Rs blocked. But fewer Rs elected!
MikeGrunwald	704753495199629312	2016-03-01T19:41:41	24) Now they might nominate someone who's awesome at branding and marketing and fighting. They're unhappy about it, and they should be. END
MikeGrunwald	704752705336639488	2016-03-01T19:38:33	23) The GOP has strayed not only from its policy principles but from policy period. It's been all about branding and marketing and fighting.
MikeGrunwald	704752159355756544	2016-03-01T19:36:23	22) This is maybe a long-winded way of saying that Republicans have reaped what they sowed, but what they sowed wasn't right-wing policies.
MikeGrunwald	704751589614096385	2016-03-01T19:34:07	21) He isn't a far-right Republican, but Obama isn't a far-left liberal.
MikeGrunwald	704751235124105217	2016-03-01T19:32:42	20) Trump isn't nuanced or measured or technnocratic or no-drama or anything else that Obama is. He sure ain't no community organizer.
MikeGrunwald	704750809578381312	2016-03-01T19:31:01	19) So now Republican voters are about to nominate the ultimate anti-Obama.
MikeGrunwald	704750645044236288	2016-03-01T19:30:22	18) The best example is probably Common Core/education reform. Obama basically stole the GOP platform. So the GOP abandoned it.
MikeGrunwald	704750371307134978	2016-03-01T19:29:16	17) But the GOP hasn't been consistently conservative over the last eight years. The GOP has been consistently anti-Obama.
MikeGrunwald	704750124065529856	2016-03-01T19:28:17	16) Trump isn't conservative. He doesn't care about policy. And conservatives wonder why that hasn't been disqualifying in the GOP primary.
MikeGrunwald	704749535436865536	2016-03-01T19:25:57	15) But then along comes Donald J. Trump.
MikeGrunwald	704749219601637376	2016-03-01T19:24:42	14) Again, this hasn't stopped the Rs from taking back both houses of Congress and a lot of statehouses. It wasn't a dumb strategy.
MikeGrunwald	704748987992186883	2016-03-01T19:23:46	13) The point is, the principled rhetoric (limit government, reduce deficits, solve problems) became totally detached from the substance.
MikeGrunwald	704748363678359553	2016-03-01T19:21:18	12) Sometimes reflexive opposition is just weird. Think Romney blasting Obama for refusing to touch entitlements...and for cutting Medicare.
MikeGrunwald	704747906788630528	2016-03-01T19:19:29	11) Sometimes reflexive opposition has led the party into crazytown. McCain ran on cap-and-trade, but now, yeesh. 
MikeGrunwald	704747273469759488	2016-03-01T19:16:58	10) I'm not a foreign policy expert but my sense is it's the same story there. Rs won't even authorize Obama's war against ISIS.
MikeGrunwald	704746646064787456	2016-03-01T19:14:28	9) But there's no principle involved. In 2009, almost every R voted against Obama's small business tax cuts. That's Republican apple pie.
MikeGrunwald	704745821867253761	2016-03-01T19:11:12	8) This was smart politics. McConnell explained why: The public looks at DC warfare and sees that Obama broke his post-partisan promises.
MikeGrunwald	704745270517616640	2016-03-01T19:09:00	7) This happened all the time. Bush's bipartisan phaseout of inefficient incandescents became Obama's communist grab of your light bulbs.
MikeGrunwald	704744738260385792	2016-03-01T19:06:53	6) The obvious example was the Republican war on Obama's evil leftist government takeover that happened to be modeled on Romneycare.
MikeGrunwald	704744120464621568	2016-03-01T19:04:26	5) It all made them so brazen. They declared war on Obama's crazy socialist $787B Porkulus, but voted for a nearly identical $715B stimulus.
MikeGrunwald	704742885707661312	2016-03-01T18:59:32	4) Some of this was the decision by GOP leaders to oppose everything Obama did before he even took office. 
MikeGrunwald	704742158381797376	2016-03-01T18:56:38	3) Some of this is really familiar stuff. Pushing gigantic tax cuts and clamoring for military spending while raging about deficits, etc.
MikeGrunwald	704740858168483840	2016-03-01T18:51:28	2) My basic critique of the GOP was that it wasn't on the level. It wasn't about conservatism. It was about politics and power.
MikeGrunwald	704740315677257728	2016-03-01T18:49:19	1) In recent years, I've taken flack for criticizing the Obama-era GOP. Now that some Republicans are echoing me, I have a few thoughts.
MikeGrunwald	704415586701484033	2016-02-29T21:18:57	It's funny how Obama people call polls "research."
MikeGrunwald	704396880189517824	2016-02-29T20:04:37	Much less coal burned in China &amp; US = Much better chance the planet doesn't get fried. 
MikeGrunwald	704313707740971009	2016-02-29T14:34:08	Trump must have had really terrible earpieces during those years when he was demanding ID from the president of the United States.
MikeGrunwald	704300762868936704	2016-02-29T13:42:41	*sits at keyboard* *clears throat* DiCaprio illustrated the preening arrogance of an insipid Hollywood... *pauses* Nah he was right.

MikeGrunwald	704063337752076289	2016-02-28T21:59:15	It was OK when Trump demanded ID from the president and called Mexicans rapists and tweeted fake stats about black crime but now...

MikeGrunwald	703702057207898112	2016-02-27T22:03:39	darth it was very unbecoming to get hugged like that.
MikeGrunwald	703694294234828800	2016-02-27T21:32:48	Remember when Obama degraded the presidency by doing his March Madness bracket?
MikeGrunwald	703345723383914496	2016-02-26T22:27:42	Now book attacks Obama's "non-action" on gun control AFTER the 2013 gun control bill died. That bill was, like, action.
MikeGrunwald	703339807192260608	2016-02-26T22:04:12	Book says immigration reform failed because O only got 68 senators, "not the 80-plus votes that could have provided real cover for Boehner."
MikeGrunwald	703323944410062848	2016-02-26T21:01:10	These are very cool. And thanks to drvox for mentioning my futile crusade.

MikeGrunwald	703064965335359488	2016-02-26T03:52:04	My favorite part of this debate was the vicious catfight over climate that didn't happen because nobody ever talks about climate.
MikeGrunwald	703060696188248064	2016-02-26T03:35:06	The transcript is going to be like: [crosstalk]
MikeGrunwald	703059800423165952	2016-02-26T03:31:33	Rubio sputtering about how Trump always responds to substantive policy critiques with personal attacks is so true and so sad.
MikeGrunwald	703058641914568704	2016-02-26T03:26:57	I like the Trump proposal to send all the politicians to the beach whenever they get tempted to intervene in the Middle East.
MikeGrunwald	703056794797645824	2016-02-26T03:19:36	Obviously, everybody wants to see regime change in North Korea. And get real, nobody is going to do anything about it.
MikeGrunwald	703054154604929024	2016-02-26T03:09:07	Is Trump just going to let people die in places other than the streets?
MikeGrunwald	703051783476813824	2016-02-26T02:59:41	Rubio says everyone needs a plan to avoid a debt crisis. His is $7 trillion in tax cuts and much more military spending.
MikeGrunwald	703051216918548480	2016-02-26T02:57:26	Kasich touts new jobs; every current governor touts new jobs. I wonder how that can be in a nation heading into the abyss.
MikeGrunwald	703049256333123584	2016-02-26T02:49:39	Another annoying Obamacare fact: Health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in half a century.
MikeGrunwald	703048645936082945	2016-02-26T02:47:13	Everyone's asking why Rubio hasn't been like this in earlier debates. Maybe because everyone kept saying Rubio was winning earlier debates.
MikeGrunwald	703048042925170688	2016-02-26T02:44:50	Rubio showed that Trump has no real plan to replace Obamacare. But Rubio doesn't have a real plan either.

MikeGrunwald	703044419780526081	2016-02-26T02:30:26	Trump calls Reagan "a somewhat conservative president, more importantly a great president." He's trying to tear GOP away from conservatism.
MikeGrunwald	703043535654756353	2016-02-26T02:26:55	Somebody should make a documentary of Trump parentheticals.

MikeGrunwald	703037363325423617	2016-02-26T02:02:23	Maybe Ben Carson is on the Colbert payroll, or doing a Joaquin Phoenix-type gonzo film?
MikeGrunwald	703036580789936129	2016-02-26T01:59:17	The three leading candidates are all doing a pretty good job shredding each other.
MikeGrunwald	703033805137809408	2016-02-26T01:48:15	Rubio must be listening to Trump and thinking: I'm the repetitive one?
MikeGrunwald	703032752086454273	2016-02-26T01:44:04	Carson still sounds like one of the morphlings from District Six.

MikeGrunwald	702959972670414849	2016-02-25T20:54:52	I will say there are occasional insights buried in this mountain of conventional wisdom. And it certainly hasn't hurt the author's career.

MikeGrunwald	702953948991328256	2016-02-25T20:30:56	Still reading this lame book. The author genuinely seems to think the purpose of passing legislation is to enhance presidential popularity.

MikeGrunwald	702851668174610432	2016-02-25T13:44:30	This is why it feels so dumb to take policy seriously in 2016. And they all complain about the debt.

MikeGrunwald	700760907266195456	2016-02-19T19:16:34	I love how in his very first answer, VP took a random whack at Rubio...and then a random whack at Obama! 
MikeGrunwald	700748171002007552	2016-02-19T18:25:57	If Joe Biden was secretly mulling a prez run this call for a centrist SCOTUS pick (via MikeGrunwald) done kilt it.

MikeGrunwald	700436697239068673	2016-02-18T21:48:16	Angry anti-rape gentleman feminist Joe Biden is one of the best Joe Bidens.
MikeGrunwald	700436032357969920	2016-02-18T21:45:38	He says dudes who watch their frat brothers drag "drunk coed" upstairs without intervening are just as guilty. "That is cowardly!"
MikeGrunwald	700435440281583616	2016-02-18T21:43:17	Biden talks about getting college dudes to take a public pledge against rape. "No means no. No means no." 
MikeGrunwald	700434846808559616	2016-02-18T21:40:55	Biden says there's been huge progress on violence against women over 25, but still an epidemic of violence against younger women.

MikeGrunwald	700397163876995072	2016-02-18T19:11:11	Lots of good guesses but of course steveschale was the only one Ready for Biden's Answer. It was...."possibilities."
MikeGrunwald	700395764153843714	2016-02-18T19:05:37	Biden says Xi - whom he knows "better than anyone else" - once asked him to describe America in one word. Anyone want to guess Biden's word?
MikeGrunwald	700394478041829376	2016-02-18T19:00:30	Biden doing a riff on "job sprawl," on urban residents with no cars who have to take three buses to get to work.
MikeGrunwald	700393706474463232	2016-02-18T18:57:26	This is what the Biden campaign would have sounded like. Via politico.

MikeGrunwald	700391897215344640	2016-02-18T18:50:15	He's thinking: "Hey, Hillary &amp; Bernie, stop being such Debbie Downers." 
MikeGrunwald	700390430756614145	2016-02-18T18:44:25	Biden in St. Paul, confirming thesis of my story: "I'm so tired of everyone talking down America's prospects!" 
MikeGrunwald	700387864136196096	2016-02-18T18:34:14	After this trip I'm going to start calling everything "multimodal." I have a multimodal driveway.

MikeGrunwald	700354215382794243	2016-02-18T16:20:31	Enjoyed this StrongTowns recap of my Twitter war with Miami Beach. It needs an update: The city backed down. 
MikeGrunwald	700352892918743040	2016-02-18T16:15:16	I'm not sure this is shorter than reading my tweets but I definitely endorse. 
MikeGrunwald	700352386011897857	2016-02-18T16:13:15	mattyglesias i'm not sure either. but someone did - maybe they were wrong but it beats SOP of totally ignoring economics/environment.
MikeGrunwald	700167285365837825	2016-02-18T03:57:43	From October  
MikeGrunwald	700094156027199490	2016-02-17T23:07:08	That's it for today. St. Paul tomorrow. Sorry if I'm boring everyone to death with stimulus tweets. 
MikeGrunwald	700089113664311296	2016-02-17T22:47:06	"Some of my R friends see stimulus as a dirty word. Well, the EU decided not to do stimulus. Where are they now?" - VP
MikeGrunwald	700088394831908866	2016-02-17T22:44:14	Biden: "I'm a Democrat so you might not trust me. But Darrell Issa said this was the best-managed government program in history."
MikeGrunwald	700088164375875584	2016-02-17T22:43:20	This Biden guy is stealing some of my stimulus lines.
MikeGrunwald	700086479989506048	2016-02-17T22:36:38	Biden said he's traveled 2M miles on Amtrak. "They ought to name the whole system after me."
MikeGrunwald	700085030027022336	2016-02-17T22:30:52	Basically, this project is helping to unclog the arteries of commerce between the Northeast and Southeast.
MikeGrunwald	700084444254724096	2016-02-17T22:28:33	In fairness, I'm almost as deep in the tank for freight rail as I am for the stimulus. 
MikeGrunwald	700083854346838017	2016-02-17T22:26:12	Freight rail cleaned up at the start of TIGER, because there were decades of pent-up demand for no-brainer projects that hadn't been funded.
MikeGrunwald	700083210777014272	2016-02-17T22:23:39	The feds helped with intermodal stuff to boost cargo capacity. Norfolk Southern covered most of the $2.5B project.
MikeGrunwald	700082721368870912	2016-02-17T22:21:42	Freight railroads are private, so there was no federal program for this stuff. Before TIGER put out $ for projects with big public benefits.
MikeGrunwald	700082180643393536	2016-02-17T22:19:33	Now Biden is outside Memphis to check out the Crescent Corridor freight rail project, which got a $105M TIGER grant from the stimulus.
MikeGrunwald	700064608598433792	2016-02-17T21:09:43	.JFriedman44 VP That was a vicious insult, although I'm not necessarily denying its accuracy.
MikeGrunwald	700049012947177472	2016-02-17T20:07:45	Traveling with VP + The Recovery Act anniversary is hands down the best day of MikeGrunwald 's 2016 
MikeGrunwald	700041551620108288	2016-02-17T19:38:06	Here's VP on the stimulus. 
MikeGrunwald	700030034975690752	2016-02-17T18:52:20	"Detroit's on the balls of its heels." I could listen to vp talk all day.
MikeGrunwald	700029228507488256	2016-02-17T18:49:08	Biden using the word "stimulate" about the economy, which Obama never does. "It's not a dirty word!"
MikeGrunwald	700026729319030785	2016-02-17T18:39:12	MikeGrunwald It's like your Woodstock
MikeGrunwald	700026935011778560	2016-02-17T18:40:01	Biden overdosing on stimulus: "I'm even beginning to bore myself, talking about this stuff." Never happens to me, VP
MikeGrunwald	700025908367757312	2016-02-17T18:35:57	Biden says he spoke to every governor about stimulus except for Alaska's. "Don't know why she didn't want to talk. And then she quit!"
MikeGrunwald	700025302005608448	2016-02-17T18:33:32	Now Biden is trashing Jindal for turning down some broadband $ from the stimulus. Nobody likes Jindal.
MikeGrunwald	700024988343017472	2016-02-17T18:32:17	Biden is doing soup to nuts on the stimulus: tax cuts, solar, health IT, Pell grants, biofuels, Race to the Top, high-speed rail, etc.
MikeGrunwald	700022708973621248	2016-02-17T18:23:14	Biden mangles the name of the deputy transportation secretary, Victor Mendez. Not Menendez.
MikeGrunwald	700022108139577344	2016-02-17T18:20:51	Rep. Richmond and Gov. Bel Edwards both furiously subtweeting Bobby Jindal. "A $2B deficit I inherited."
MikeGrunwald	700021088697327616	2016-02-17T18:16:47	NO Mayor Landrieu: you see a city that's growing, values going up. When you invest in infrastructure, you create jobs &amp; strength.
MikeGrunwald	700020682269175809	2016-02-17T18:15:11	Rep. Cedric Richmond sums up the Obama political dilemma: "This administration has been better to Louisiana than we've been to them."
MikeGrunwald	700017113608507396	2016-02-17T18:01:00	By the way, main complainer was LA Sen. Vitter. Also, &gt;1/3 of TIGER grants were rural or tribal. Which seems too high to me but so it goes.
MikeGrunwald	700014612788326401	2016-02-17T17:51:03	The one political complaint about TIGER has been too much $ for cities. But this is classic urban project that moves cargo way beyond city.
MikeGrunwald	700012562264358912	2016-02-17T17:42:55	There wasn't a silo for multi-modal public-private projects like this. TIGER has busted up the silos. 
MikeGrunwald	700010903106793472	2016-02-17T17:36:19	Jobs for the guys in hard hats, of course. But also more freight moving by rail, less by gas-guzzling trucks. 
MikeGrunwald	700010374985154560	2016-02-17T17:34:13	The Port of New Orleans got a $16.7M grant to redo its railyard. It increased cargo capacity 1000%. 
MikeGrunwald	700008277757730816	2016-02-17T17:25:53	It's even changing the culture of DOT, which had never really bothered to judge projects by their economic and environmental value.
MikeGrunwald	700007695575691264	2016-02-17T17:23:34	That's one reason TIGER has outlasted the stimulus. Congress has approved 7 rounds worth $4.6B. 6700 applications, only 381 funded.
MikeGrunwald	700007211129376769	2016-02-17T17:21:39	That's revolutionary. Usually, the feds send states $ for whatever projects they want to do that check the legal boxes, no matter how lame.
MikeGrunwald	700006745888788480	2016-02-17T17:19:48	And it's a competitive grant program. The stimulus funded 51 projects in the first round out of 1400 applications.
MikeGrunwald	700005465619456000	2016-02-17T17:14:43	So what's TIGER? Basically, a grant program for cool transportation projects that don't fit in traditional transportation silos.
MikeGrunwald	700005098362044416	2016-02-17T17:13:15	Today, VP is celebrating the stimulus birthday by visiting TIGER projects. Rs hate the stimulus but just about everyone loves TIGER.
MikeGrunwald	700000670896644096	2016-02-17T16:55:39	Not on purpose! "RonaldKlain: mattyglesias MikeGrunwald Umm, we definitely did NOT design it that way....”
MikeGrunwald	699962045614202880	2016-02-17T14:22:10	OK, some guy named Joe just came back to tell us we're heading to New Orleans. More later...
MikeGrunwald	699961626087260160	2016-02-17T14:20:30	Also: some stimulus projects failed! Solyndra, A123, Fisker, FutureGen and some other clean coal stuff, some dumb broadband stuff.
MikeGrunwald	699959934910341121	2016-02-17T14:13:47	You're skipping ahead! "gordontrac: MikeGrunwald And changed the way infra $ is spent, eg TIGER competitive awards vs antiquated formulas”
MikeGrunwald	699958832261423109	2016-02-17T14:09:24	TPCarney it was also the only earmark in the stimulus! a durbin special. and a real mess.
MikeGrunwald	699958483307909120	2016-02-17T14:08:01	And a program called Build America Bonds helped finance another $182B in local infrastructure projects. A stimulus hidden in the stimulus!
MikeGrunwald	699957668346249217	2016-02-17T14:04:47	TPCarney there was a valiant effort to transform it into something less egregious. it failed too.
MikeGrunwald	699957420701937665	2016-02-17T14:03:48	There were no new dams. But there was the largest-ever dam removal project. It restored a big stretch of the Elwha River &amp; its salmon runs.
MikeGrunwald	699956405126701058	2016-02-17T13:59:46	TPCarney dead!
MikeGrunwald	699956330048708609	2016-02-17T13:59:28	For example, there was $11B for a smarter electric grid. And $27B for health information technology, which is modern infrastructure.
MikeGrunwald	699955866032873473	2016-02-17T13:57:37	Another stimulus myth is no $ for infrastructure. Actually there was $48B for transportation infrastructure. And that's not the whole story.
MikeGrunwald	699954388056543232	2016-02-17T13:51:45	For example: LAX, JFK, Ellis Island, Route 66, Brooklyn Bridge, National Mall, Everglades, Grand Canyon all got stimulus projects.
MikeGrunwald	699953779060404224	2016-02-17T13:49:20	The stimulus didn't build lots of new iconic stuff like Hoover Dam or Skyline Drive. But it repaired lots of old iconic stuff.
MikeGrunwald	699946638014554112	2016-02-17T13:20:57	Happy 7th anniversary, stimulus! Going to check out some projects... 
MikeGrunwald	699912525513682944	2016-02-17T11:05:24	Those Midwesterners all look alike. Very dry SchreckReports. 
MikeGrunwald	699755543381065729	2016-02-17T00:41:37	Tomorrow, I'm spending the 7th birthday of the stimulus with the best friend of the stimulus. 
MikeGrunwald	699688070766075904	2016-02-16T20:13:30	OK, my flight is landing. But if you want to know more about the stimulus.... 
MikeGrunwald	699686097274728448	2016-02-16T20:05:39	Yes, the stimulus financed Solyndra. Also Tesla, America's largest wind farm, 9 of world's largest solar farms. 
MikeGrunwald	699684243618865152	2016-02-16T19:58:17	The stimulus financed smart electric meters for 16.6M American homes. Including, full disclosure, mine. 
MikeGrunwald	699682895749894144	2016-02-16T19:52:56	The stimulus dumped $150M into this crazy genome data project. All it did was transform cancer research. 
MikeGrunwald	699679865595940866	2016-02-16T19:40:54	Even I had forgotten that the stimulus financed this super-green new Coast Guard HQ. 
MikeGrunwald	699648934306803712	2016-02-16T17:37:59	Pretty unusual place to find a kiwi. Pretty unusual place to find a gorilla. Pretty normal place to find a pillow. 
MikeGrunwald	699625731886809088	2016-02-16T16:05:47	This is exactly what they want you to think. 
MikeGrunwald	699607295043493888	2016-02-16T14:52:31	When stimulus passed 7 years ago, almost no hospitals used electronic health records. Now almost all do. 
MikeGrunwald	699605533637087232	2016-02-16T14:45:31	When stimulus passed 7 years ago, US barely had 1GW of PV solar. Now on track to hit 40GW by end of 2016. 
MikeGrunwald	699586526662021125	2016-02-16T13:30:00	Nope. Elkhart had 95K jobs in 2/09, 130K jobs today. 
MikeGrunwald	699586099535069185	2016-02-16T13:28:18	Here's your reminder that the Republican front-runner is too. 
MikeGrunwald	699381795876429824	2016-02-15T23:56:28	"This is just nuts, OK? Jeez, oh man!" My dispatch on Donald J. Trump vs. George W. Bush. 
MikeGrunwald	699355352609984512	2016-02-15T22:11:24	Actually, Elkhart now has 130K jobs. Seven years ago, it had 95K. Do you see a different trend elsewhere? 
MikeGrunwald	699349460875407360	2016-02-15T21:47:59	Unemployment was 20% in Elkhart, IN, 7 years ago when Obama visited to promote his stimulus bill. Now it's...wow. 
MikeGrunwald	699340518631809024	2016-02-15T21:12:27	This is an exciting week, everyone. How are you going to celebrate the 7th anniversary of the stimulus?
MikeGrunwald	699327490150551552	2016-02-15T20:20:41	Process For Dummies: POTUS can nominate judges. Senate can block judges. Everyone can play politics. (NB: Still true next year.)

MikeGrunwald	699276434947203072	2016-02-15T16:57:48	nothing to see here except a bloody murder, a $10m gambling loss, and Donald Trump calling the Rand Corp. for help 
MikeGrunwald	699251595859599360	2016-02-15T15:19:06	I was sort of joking about the Code Pink protester:  But Code Pink really is embracing him: 
MikeGrunwald	699248961207537665	2016-02-15T15:08:38	Clearly it's OUTRAGEOUS that Rs are refusing to even consider an Obama nominee. But pretending to consider an Obama nominee would be OK.
MikeGrunwald	699236173101821952	2016-02-15T14:17:49	Gee, wish he had told me, and his mom. "Don't mess with the immigrants, my son."

MikeGrunwald	698873642986430464	2016-02-14T14:17:15	Last night's GOP debate was positively surreal and MikeGrunwald captures it perfectly  
MikeGrunwald	698851238012723200	2016-02-14T12:48:13	I wrote about last night's magnificent Republican festival of WTF: Trump Goes Code Pink on George W. Bush 
MikeGrunwald	698758670608424960	2016-02-14T06:40:24	My take on the awesome crazy hilarious GOPDebate: Trump vs. George W. Bush. 
MikeGrunwald	698722752421851137	2016-02-14T04:17:40	OMG this debate transcript.  BUSH: "My mom is the strongest woman I know." TRUMP: "She should be running."
MikeGrunwald	698720329846419457	2016-02-14T04:08:02	JeffreyGoldberg everything is awesome TM
MikeGrunwald	698718623859412992	2016-02-14T04:01:16	Basically, Trump was Code Pink with an orange wig.
MikeGrunwald	698718259076558849	2016-02-14T03:59:49	Trump tonight: W lied about Iraq, 9/11 was W's fault, Jeb is pathetic, Jeb is a liar, Cruz is a liar and everyone hates him. Go GOP!
MikeGrunwald	698717667209965569	2016-02-14T03:57:28	It is hard to describe that debate without using any of the words that Donald Trump says he won't use anymore.
MikeGrunwald	698717017101172736	2016-02-14T03:54:53	Every time Trump gets booed he goes up 10 points in the polls.
MikeGrunwald	698715653348450304	2016-02-14T03:49:27	Yeah that Stalin quote is 100 percent made up 
MikeGrunwald	698714788784959488	2016-02-14T03:46:01	My timeline right now is split between a crazy slam-dunk contest...and the NBA All-Star Game festivities.
MikeGrunwald	698713458532032513	2016-02-14T03:40:44	Trump has called Jeb and Cruz a liar. Rubio called Cruz a liar, too. This is just a spectacular debate.
MikeGrunwald	698712939528876033	2016-02-14T03:38:40	Trump is asked if he's ever wrong, tells a story about how often the people around him are wrong.
MikeGrunwald	698711594751156228	2016-02-14T03:33:20	Dickerson should just throw his hands up in the air and say, whatever, i'm outta here, you guys fight amongst yourselves.
MikeGrunwald	698711134766047238	2016-02-14T03:31:30	Senator Rubio, please talk about anything you want, and Mr. Trump, please keep yelling "LIAR!" in the background.
MikeGrunwald	698710602169131008	2016-02-14T03:29:23	This debate is coocoocachoo.
MikeGrunwald	698710163134550016	2016-02-14T03:27:38	"This guy will say anything," says the guy who really will say anything.
MikeGrunwald	698708102896558080	2016-02-14T03:19:27	A Bush-Clinton-Trump general election would be pretty interesting, huh?
MikeGrunwald	698706963643920384	2016-02-14T03:14:56	The DemDebate made me think the Dems are in trouble.  And now the GOPDebate makes me think the GOP is in trouble.
MikeGrunwald	698706476458758145	2016-02-14T03:12:59	"We're fixing to lose the election to Hillary Clinton if we don't stop this." John Kasich, telling the truth again.
MikeGrunwald	698706222531350528	2016-02-14T03:11:59	Trump just walked over to Jeb Bush and gave him an atomic wedgie! OK that didn't happen yet but any minute now.
MikeGrunwald	698705343988297728	2016-02-14T03:08:29	Now Rubio goes after Cruz for failing to speak Spanish. And Cruz responds in Spanish. And this is the craziest Republican debate ever.
MikeGrunwald	698704968640045056	2016-02-14T03:07:00	@Leon_Krauze Ha. But reread the story, Leon. He left all kind of exit ramps - I wrote about how he was leaving all his options open.
MikeGrunwald	698702962563092480	2016-02-14T02:59:02	Still can't believe that Bush-lied-people-died, 9/11-happened-under-Bush stuff. Trump genuinely does not GAF.
MikeGrunwald	698700843235872769	2016-02-14T02:50:36	Now KimStrassel accuses Rubio, whose $12 trillion tax cut includes the abolition of capital gains taxes, of being liberal on taxes.
MikeGrunwald	698700150894682114	2016-02-14T02:47:51	Really, consumption taxes? It's like they interrupted Hearns-Hagler mid-fight for a dissertation defense.
MikeGrunwald	698698810890022914	2016-02-14T02:42:32	To recap: George W. Bush was way better than the Democrats at preventing 9/11, working with coalitions, and killing bin Laden.
MikeGrunwald	698697840852340740	2016-02-14T02:38:41	Now Rubio attacks Bill Clinton for failing to kill bin Laden! Hmm, did the president after Clinton kill bin Laden, or was it someone else?
MikeGrunwald	698697573989793792	2016-02-14T02:37:37	"How did George W. Bush keep us safe when the World Trade Center came down during his reign?" This is unbelievable.
MikeGrunwald	698697002922700801	2016-02-14T02:35:21	"This is just crazy. This is just nuts. Jeez, oh man." -- John Kasich, telling the truth.
MikeGrunwald	698696500117946369	2016-02-14T02:33:21	I swear, I could watch Trump rip Jeb &amp; the Iraq War forever.
MikeGrunwald	698696006230241280	2016-02-14T02:31:23	AlCardenasFL_DC It's OK Al. (And thanks for your support for AIJustice - my wife is on the board.)
MikeGrunwald	698695797039194113	2016-02-14T02:30:33	Bernie Sanders says we should "destroy" ISIS, while Ted Cruz says we should "utterly defeat" ISIS. I think Bernie sounds tougher.
MikeGrunwald	698695222511988736	2016-02-14T02:28:16	It's simple: Defeat ISIS, contain Iran, overthrow Assad, punch Putin in the nose, arm Ukraine, fix the Shia-Sunni problem, stop North Ko
MikeGrunwald	698693593582727169	2016-02-14T02:21:48	AlCardenasFL_DC It was a joke Al. And you should be a fan of Dickerson - he is always on the side of facts.
MikeGrunwald	698692672517701632	2016-02-14T02:18:08	Apparently the next justice should be a right-wing originalist, but a consensus right-wing originalist.
MikeGrunwald	698692047612596228	2016-02-14T02:15:39	Very sad to see jdickerson revealing his obvious bias in favor of facts.
MikeGrunwald	698690695662534656	2016-02-14T02:10:17	Ben Carson says lifetime tenure for the Supreme Court ought to be looked at. I agree with him!
MikeGrunwald	698677959356502016	2016-02-14T01:19:40	Really, Obama should pick brilliant Richard_Primus. And you should read his state-of-the-Court piece POLITICOMag. 
MikeGrunwald	698669249838084096	2016-02-14T00:45:04	If Obama wants to get out the vote for Hillary, there's apparently a super-smart Latina lesbian on the Colorado Supreme Court.
MikeGrunwald	698638372777148421	2016-02-13T22:42:22	Obama should nominate Trump's sister.
MikeGrunwald	698628863258001409	2016-02-13T22:04:35	RIP Antonin Scalia, apparently. This is going to be the mother of all judicial battles.
MikeGrunwald	698590077094596609	2016-02-13T19:30:28	Thanks, it is one of those stranger-than-fiction moments in history.

MikeGrunwald	698540513503375360	2016-02-13T16:13:31	I wish I could recuse myself from writing about everyone.

MikeGrunwald	698279596299575297	2016-02-12T22:56:43	Very good piece from Gary__Bass who has written probably the most devastating takedown of Kissinger: 
MikeGrunwald	698266808642572288	2016-02-12T22:05:55	Aw thanks boss. 
MikeGrunwald	698262095847145472	2016-02-12T21:47:11	JohnnyCakes3 then it's almost exactly 2/3.
MikeGrunwald	698258783844175872	2016-02-12T21:34:01	Sharp MikeGrunwald: by echoing Sanders' view that US is in a shambles, does Hillary play into GOP hands this fall? 
MikeGrunwald	698243123437314057	2016-02-12T20:31:48	NickMerrill thanks Nick. but does she really agree there's massive despair all over the country? That's a tough message for a D campaign!

MikeGrunwald	698184424484163585	2016-02-12T16:38:33	My take on the Everything Is Awful DemDebate. It's a weird play for Hillary. 
MikeGrunwald	698165414954717188	2016-02-12T15:23:00	maryannehitt Seems pretty easy! A few snarky tweets and the city caved. What takes you guys so long?

MikeGrunwald	697991894203240450	2016-02-12T03:53:30	Hillary's closing message: I agree with Bernie that everything is horrible, but he doesn't talk about most of the really horrible stuff!
MikeGrunwald	697990589430759424	2016-02-12T03:48:19	Now it's the Obama-love portion. Bernie says he's made "enormous progress," which is odd because he's been describing the US as a dystopia.
MikeGrunwald	697988032339824640	2016-02-12T03:38:09	Well, Kissinger sucks. Read this great Gary__Bass book about him abetting genocide:  
MikeGrunwald	697986870098182144	2016-02-12T03:33:32	Hillary notes Bernie has zero foreign policy advisers. Bernie notes Kissinger is not one of those zero. Bernie won that round.
MikeGrunwald	697985484941873152	2016-02-12T03:28:02	I have to say, I am also proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. Good for Bernie for swerving off the road to run him over.

MikeGrunwald	697975019163484162	2016-02-12T02:46:26	Bernie talks about "the economic crisis of high unemployment." The unemployment rate is 4.9%. That is not high.

MikeGrunwald	697968176596914176	2016-02-12T02:19:15	Hillary can't win a who's-the-real-progressive fight. She can win a who's-closer-to-Obama fight and a who-can-fight-Republicans fight.

MikeGrunwald	697831353744814080	2016-02-11T17:15:34	There are hardly any bike racks. Plenty of parking garages though. 
MikeGrunwald	697829324083355649	2016-02-11T17:07:30	This is a great idea. Too many of us continue to flout social norms by trying to get around without a car.

MikeGrunwald	688720369767731200	2016-01-17T13:51:46	lizzieohreally adamdavidson mike_hogan i agree synthetic cdo's &amp; complexity generally helped accelerate panic, but didn't cause panic.
MikeGrunwald	688719945211842560	2016-01-17T13:50:05	asociologist i think unfair but it was interesting that the movie left out the short who actively tried to drag down the market.
MikeGrunwald	688718683091255297	2016-01-17T13:45:04	JesseJenkins adamdavidson I think it's a very good analysis with very good proposals; who knows if she's really serious about it.
MikeGrunwald	688712322995609600	2016-01-17T13:19:48	GhostPanther while we're chatting, why did you say there's nothing about clearing derivatives in reform? adam says you just misspoke?
MikeGrunwald	688700286345605121	2016-01-17T12:31:58	GhostPanther really, they and other non-transparent instruments helped accelerate panic but didn't cause it.
MikeGrunwald	688698521894129664	2016-01-17T12:24:57	GhostPanther sure there was some fraud, but tough to prove, and not what caused the crisis. as you seemed to recognize until the end.

MikeGrunwald	688499966524936194	2016-01-16T23:15:58	21. But the goal should be to avoid panics. And the reforms in place are a major achievement in that direction. Thanks for engaging, MG.
MikeGrunwald	688499735758524417	2016-01-16T23:15:03	20. To end on a note of consensus, I agree with your point #4. Confusion over CDOs and complexity in general did accelerate the panic.
MikeGrunwald	688499445261012992	2016-01-16T23:13:54	19. Anyway, their evil didn't kill their banks. Their dumb bets killed their banks. Their evil often facilitated more dumb betting.
MikeGrunwald	688498844133359616	2016-01-16T23:11:30	18. I do think the obviousness of their crimes has been overstated; btw tough Wall Street cop Ben Lawsky agrees. 
MikeGrunwald	688498097081679872	2016-01-16T23:08:32	17. The obvious problem with the malice case: The evil geniuses at Citi &amp; Lehman &amp; Bear and so on ran their firms into the ground!
MikeGrunwald	688497427687600129	2016-01-16T23:05:53	16. The Big Short actually did an excellent job of making the stupidity case ("It's a gully.") until the soliloquy at the end.
MikeGrunwald	688496912463429632	2016-01-16T23:03:50	15. Yes, there was sleaze throughout the securitization process. But the consenting adults who bought Abacus wanted to be long housing too.
MikeGrunwald	688496232222867457	2016-01-16T23:01:08	14. Yes, CDO's and other complexities helped disguise risks that were being taken. But the problem was the insatiable appetite for risk.
MikeGrunwald	688495648170225665	2016-01-16T22:58:48	13. But nothing Adam said contradicts that the crisis was caused a simple mix of mania plus (short-term, poorly regulated) leverage.
MikeGrunwald	688494445650669568	2016-01-16T22:54:02	12. Yes, there was lots of complexity. And complexity helped accelerate the panic. There was also lots of nasty behavior on Wall Street.
MikeGrunwald	688494006788067328	2016-01-16T22:52:17	11. My other two main points are less dogmatic. I think TBS overemphasized complexity and fraud as drivers of the crisis.
MikeGrunwald	688493462166073344	2016-01-16T22:50:07	10. Anyway, the worst part of thebigshort was its dramatic conclusion that nothing has changed. That's kinda cuckoo.
MikeGrunwald	688492485010673664	2016-01-16T22:46:14	9. Now many SIFI's are shrinking to avoid bigness penalties. But reform appropriately focused mostly on risk/capital/leverage/transparency.
MikeGrunwald	688491859551875073	2016-01-16T22:43:45	8. JPM/BofA/Wells got bigger because they swallowed Bear/WaMu/Countrywide/Merrill/Wachovia during the crisis. And prevented an apocalypse.
MikeGrunwald	688491416293617667	2016-01-16T22:41:59	7. Adam suggests this doesn't matter because some big banks got bigger. I've written about why this is misleading. 
MikeGrunwald	688490372406865924	2016-01-16T22:37:50	6. There have been huge changes. Progressive capital charges. Living wills. Resolution authority. Repo reforms. And of course stress tests.
MikeGrunwald	688489614441603073	2016-01-16T22:34:50	5. Adam also acknowledged that GhostPanther was wrong about derivatives. Most trades are now cleared, with collateral. That's a big deal.
MikeGrunwald	688489315966554112	2016-01-16T22:33:39	4. The system is fundamentally safer. And I see Adam now seems to acknowledge that. 
MikeGrunwald	688488864592302080	2016-01-16T22:31:51	3. Banks have twice as much capital, half as much leverage, much less short-term financing, much tougher regulation. There's a CFPB.
MikeGrunwald	688487904012857344	2016-01-16T22:28:02	2. First of all, I can tell Adam hates when I use this word, but this is just wrong. 
MikeGrunwald	688487422255038464	2016-01-16T22:26:07	1. AdamDavidson &amp; I seem to have modest disagreements about the crisis, major disagreements about reform. Let me start with reform.
MikeGrunwald	688486389239955457	2016-01-16T22:22:01	OK, we got off to a rough start, but let me respond to AdamDavidson's substantive critique of my Big Short piece. 
MikeGrunwald	688463356844445696	2016-01-16T20:50:29	adamdavidson GhostPanther absolutely! About bailouts, stimulus and reform. I'm used to it.
MikeGrunwald	688463215106355200	2016-01-16T20:49:56	adamdavidson ok, those are arguments! Thank you. Will respond after movie with kid.
MikeGrunwald	688459802784043009	2016-01-16T20:36:22	adamdavidson GhostPanther got it, your argument is that most people disagree with me. not an argument.
MikeGrunwald	688459370837852161	2016-01-16T20:34:39	adamdavidson you're writing a lot of tweets about how everyone says these myths aren't myths but you're not explaining why.
MikeGrunwald	688458597009879040	2016-01-16T20:31:35	adamdavidson it's a song lyric! Give me a break.
MikeGrunwald	688458332525432832	2016-01-16T20:30:32	adamdavidson i guess my folly is failing to constantly say "in my opinion" - yours is appeals to authority without substantive argument.
MikeGrunwald	688457051392061442	2016-01-16T20:25:26	adamdavidson oh please. Everyone liked the movie. Including me. But it perpetuates some myths, especially myth that nothing changed.
MikeGrunwald	688456556489363457	2016-01-16T20:23:28	adamdavidson well, ghostpanther said there was nothing (not even discussion) about a derivatives clearinghouse. that's factually wrong.
MikeGrunwald	688455682257997828	2016-01-16T20:20:00	adamdavidson thebigshort do most economists believe Dodd-Frank didn't address clearing of derivatives? If so most economists are wrong.
MikeGrunwald	688453318927060992	2016-01-16T20:10:36	matthewstoller it shows reg reform isn't toothless! Big difference between acknowledging potential risk of size &amp; endorsing ban on size.
MikeGrunwald	688451885993455616	2016-01-16T20:04:55	matthewstoller I said in that piece you posted that the capital/regulatory "tax" on size might be too low. But TBTF subsidy has dwindled.
MikeGrunwald	688451425685352450	2016-01-16T20:03:05	matthewstoller It's not like I think banks ought to be big! I just don't think a mandatory cap on size makes sense.
MikeGrunwald	688444326284791808	2016-01-16T19:34:52	matthewstoller as I've written many times there should be (and is) a progressive tax on size. not an arbitrary size limit.
MikeGrunwald	688436078756401153	2016-01-16T19:02:06	Chris_arnade ah ok. that's a different issue. as you say more complex.
MikeGrunwald	688435431327797248	2016-01-16T18:59:31	Chris_arnade we're talking past each other. bailouts were great for banks. but except Fannie/Freddie prior actions not moral hazard story.
MikeGrunwald	688434545461456896	2016-01-16T18:56:00	Chris_arnade sure. but my point was that moral hazard doesn't explain their reckless bets. They thought they were golden!
MikeGrunwald	688432706917654528	2016-01-16T18:48:42	Chris_arnade how so?
