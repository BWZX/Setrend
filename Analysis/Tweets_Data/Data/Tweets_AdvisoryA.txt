AdvisoryA	722797806612664321	2016-04-20T14:43:20	SoBendito mathbabedotorg what’s weird is search criteria is usually rental price. I go for lower price 1st, often don’t even see discounts
AdvisoryA	722796241495531520	2016-04-20T14:37:07	Chris_arnade is this the most surprising result (based on generations of families I know there)?

AdvisoryA	722794140916781056	2016-04-20T14:28:46	mathbabedotorg seems like bad math: 3-4 mo's vacant + 1 mo. free (+ eating brkr fee) = much lower cashflow than lower rent, even over 3 yrs
AdvisoryA	722793170929463302	2016-04-20T14:24:55	SoBendito I figured that was the case, but I’m seeing offers of 2 months free for 2 yr lease, which undermines that approach.

AdvisoryA	722789358617673728	2016-04-20T14:09:46	mathbabedotorg so far, conclusion is: doesn't make any sense to market higher price but actually offer lower one, esp. for motivated seller
