MaMoMVPY	685160876073168898	2016-01-07T18:07:37	IkSvitzer Understanding economics is about understanding economic theory. Too many so-called analysts seem to have forgotten that.
MaMoMVPY	685160581859536896	2016-01-07T18:06:27	IkSvitzer It should be! Fed and PboC both have overly tight monetary policy. As a result aggregate demand slowed in the 2 largest economies
MaMoMVPY	685159736975724545	2016-01-07T18:03:05	IkSvitzer Well, the shock occurred once Yellen started to talk about the the Phillips curve like something out of a 1972 textbook
MaMoMVPY	685159505106178048	2016-01-07T18:02:10	IkSvitzer Fed continue to undershoot its inflation target.Therefore it has failed.
MaMoMVPY	685158938849968128	2016-01-07T17:59:55	IkSvitzer Is the ALSO a supply story? Yes, maybe that used to be part of the story, but this is pretty consistent with a global AD shock
MaMoMVPY	685158656166473729	2016-01-07T17:58:47	IkSvitzer inflation expectations have been inching down for a long time, so has the commodity prices and so has Chinese equity markets.
MaMoMVPY	685154501939064832	2016-01-07T17:42:17	IkSvitzer ...it is all Fed and the PBoC failing massively.
MaMoMVPY	685154399543537664	2016-01-07T17:41:53	IkSvitzer That is pretty simple - if this was a postive supply story global stock markets would have rallied and not collapsed.
