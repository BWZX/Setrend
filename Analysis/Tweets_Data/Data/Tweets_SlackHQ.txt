SlackHQ	725577396611600384	2016-04-28T06:48:26	davejohnson That's not good! Preference -&gt; "Turn off Inline Media &amp; Links" if your team(s) are image-heavy. Also Compact mode can help too!

SlackHQ	724558577860509696	2016-04-25T11:20:01	eldhash You can't hide mention badges, but you can clear that if you want to completely quit the team, or press Shift+Esc within the team.
SlackHQ	724541355045838848	2016-04-25T10:11:35	mxbraud No worries! Sorry for the hassle.
SlackHQ	724541281951723520	2016-04-25T10:11:17	coach_leigh Here's some more info on inviting team members, in case it's useful: 
SlackHQ	724541088791465985	2016-04-25T10:10:31	coach_leigh If you select the Team Menu at top-left, you can click "Invite people" to quickly invite more. Does that help?
SlackHQ	724540549974376448	2016-04-25T10:08:23	mark_breen Don't worry — totally got that.
SlackHQ	724540477157068800	2016-04-25T10:08:05	iamzupnik That's right. These will also cease to be visible.
SlackHQ	724540284902727680	2016-04-25T10:07:19	mark_breen Understood. Thanks again!
SlackHQ	724540213347934208	2016-04-25T10:07:02	mxbraud This issue is on our radar, sorry! You can hit Cmd K to launch Quick Switcher and type the team name, though.
SlackHQ	724540060851380224	2016-04-25T10:06:26	AkshaySingh_ Sorry about that! Could you drop us a line to feedback@slack.com letting us know which app you're using? Thanks!
SlackHQ	724539034308120577	2016-04-25T10:02:21	jazzrozz There isn't a bulk option, sorry! If you drop us a line to feedback@slack.com we might be able to offer some alternatives.

SlackHQ	724537974667546624	2016-04-25T09:58:09	AliAdams Thanks for the feedback! There are date markers in the channel, but perhaps this could be clearer. We'll share this with the team.
SlackHQ	724537702184574976	2016-04-25T09:57:04	eldhash Type /dnd and the amount of time you'd like to mute the team for. And /dnd again to un-mute earlier. 👍
SlackHQ	724537182548025344	2016-04-25T09:55:00	mark_breen D'oh! Perhaps this is something we can think about some more. Thanks for the feedback.
SlackHQ	724513275203956737	2016-04-25T08:20:00	mark_breen Not move, but you can copy and paste a message's archive link. Can also coin an emoji as polite shorthand for "wrong channel!"
SlackHQ	724512793135853568	2016-04-25T08:18:05	eldhash It doesn't disable the badge, sorry! (Strictly, it's not a notification. You can turn it off altogether in your Preferences.)

SlackHQ	724510825264852993	2016-04-25T08:10:16	CliveUA Something to consider! For important messages, you could ask team members for an emoji reaction: 
SlackHQ	724510408699187201	2016-04-25T08:08:36	jazzrozz Shuffling team members, you mean? Sounds like a case of disabling and inviting team members from

SlackHQ	723439898678579200	2016-04-22T09:14:47	heryandotus Why not create a dedicate channel for that data and spam away? Only a suggestion, though! 🤖🌊

SlackHQ	723246658667057152	2016-04-21T20:26:55	jxpx777 That's exactly right! User group members who aren't on DND will get notifications; the ones who are on DND won't. 😴
SlackHQ	723244904189702144	2016-04-21T20:19:57	atmarc YS Understandable. We hear that. DND settings help on part of the user (if set for when they're fine with being out of bed).

SlackHQ	723222064216203264	2016-04-21T18:49:11	ChrisMaki Sorry for the frustration. We'll let the team know you'd like a "never ask me again" option for that.

SlackHQ	722079854934519808	2016-04-18T15:10:27	deepj Afraid not! The user would have to manually delete them, or you can set retention settings on the paid plans to delete old messages.
SlackHQ	722079621559250944	2016-04-18T15:09:32	crebma You should be able to switch via the 'View' menu in the menubar also. We're working on getting those teams to scroll to. 😊

SlackHQ	721382294724997121	2016-04-16T16:58:36	johnjakem Hrm, what's your computer's time zone set to? ⏲
SlackHQ	721378283468820481	2016-04-16T16:42:39	johnjakem The time zone for Slack teams is based on the computer's clock, and what's in a user's profile. Is there anything off there? 🤔

SlackHQ	721092014197092352	2016-04-15T21:45:08	ivanderbyl One way to do this is to click the bell icon with z's and select "Adjust schedule..." Then make any tweaks you need to 👍 😴💤

SlackHQ	721070781321621505	2016-04-15T20:20:45	sushimustwrite Ah, yes, turning on notifications would help with this if you'd like more control over what signals for your attention!

SlackHQ	721067081358118914	2016-04-15T20:06:03	maslowbeer In a code block, try surrounding the text with triple backticks (e.g. ```foo = \`${bar}\````) and that should do the trick!
SlackHQ	721066962403459072	2016-04-15T20:05:35	maslowbeer So embarrassed we missed this. And twice! 🙈
SlackHQ	721064241265000448	2016-04-15T19:54:46	TECTOMICS Each member of the user group gets a notification that the user group has been mentioned in a channel, is that what you mean?

SlackHQ	721045180909006848	2016-04-15T18:39:02	alyssacicero THANK YOU. This gives us *just* enough excuse to restart that discussion. 😉
SlackHQ	721044910934204416	2016-04-15T18:37:57	ObjectiveCopley Yay. Also, word is, we're actively working on making this better at the moment. We gotchu, friend. 👊🏼
SlackHQ	721044689625944064	2016-04-15T18:37:05	fgbonin Thanks for the feedback! We'll share this with the team.
SlackHQ	721043837284716546	2016-04-15T18:33:41	madelynlydon We have occasionally talked about changing that message to "It's about to get real up in here" but that would just be silly.
SlackHQ	721043577799843840	2016-04-15T18:32:39	jaydestro 😍
SlackHQ	721043572225675265	2016-04-15T18:32:38	ObjectiveCopley You are right, of course, sorry to be glib. We'll pass that feedback along.

SlackHQ	721042046832783360	2016-04-15T18:26:34	ObjectiveCopley You are right. There are only so many finger actions though. And only so many fingers. We all need more arms.
SlackHQ	721041451489062912	2016-04-15T18:24:12	ObjectiveCopley Two fingers moves to and fro through channel history! For people only on one team (for they are legion), even more useful!

SlackHQ	720955749900398592	2016-04-15T12:43:40	mariejulien You could try searching for larger file types, such as .mp4, .mov and so on. Deleting those files should free up more space.

SlackHQ	720908512172339200	2016-04-15T09:35:57	henkealg The way to do that would be to copy and paste the message url, then use the /remind command. Does that work for you?
SlackHQ	720907882791837696	2016-04-15T09:33:27	mariejulien There's no way to bulk delete files, sorry! Paid teams can change retention settings per channel: 
SlackHQ	720907570144231424	2016-04-15T09:32:13	matteo_belfiore No worries. We're just glad it's sorted.

SlackHQ	720846241597300737	2016-04-15T05:28:31	aribeo It's something you or an admin can do from  💫

SlackHQ	720761116540944384	2016-04-14T23:50:15	netweb Gotcha! You could do /remind channel every monday at 9am "Hey @ usergroup, time for your weekly chat!"

SlackHQ	720757873341566976	2016-04-14T23:37:22	netweb Message reminders are just for you personally, so it won't remind a group of people.
SlackHQ	720757038876356608	2016-04-14T23:34:03	netweb Do you mean within a group DM? Or to remind a group of people about a message?
SlackHQ	720756804418977792	2016-04-14T23:33:07	nated So! We're looking into it, but currently it looks like it'll only remember your typed history *after* you turn the pref on. 🤔
SlackHQ	720754572101349376	2016-04-14T23:24:15	nated Hmm. That actually seems like a bug! We'll look into it. Sorry about that!

SlackHQ	720584688180600832	2016-04-14T12:09:12	AllyBFraz No problem! We're here when they do 🎈

SlackHQ	720583954097680384	2016-04-14T12:06:17	RunMichael That's super to hear. Thanks!
SlackHQ	720583795871715328	2016-04-14T12:05:39	itsmadnik In what way? You can sign into multiple teams with our desktop and mobile apps. Guess that's not quite what you mean, sorry!
SlackHQ	720583308573306881	2016-04-14T12:03:43	markforster That's wonderful to hear! Thank you!

SlackHQ	720582624226512896	2016-04-14T12:01:00	_JayGeorge We'll pass the suggestion along. Thank you!
SlackHQ	720582473143468033	2016-04-14T12:00:24	bokayio Ah! Might be worth a notice in your general channel that this option exists, if that's a concern? Sorry for the hassle!
SlackHQ	720581523305537536	2016-04-14T11:56:37	WeberKing Good stuff. Sorry for the delay.
SlackHQ	720581174108811264	2016-04-14T11:55:14	fstoner A browse of our App Directory may be worthwhile! Let us know if you have any questions: 
SlackHQ	720580634381533185	2016-04-14T11:53:05	DarkCisum Sorry about that! A test message in the problem conversation can clear that up, but do let us know if not.
SlackHQ	720580470812065792	2016-04-14T11:52:26	Helptap Sorry about that! Do you have a ticket id number we can chase up for you?

SlackHQ	720580215668359170	2016-04-14T11:51:25	albandum You can un-archive the old channel, rename it, then re-archive it to free up the name. Does that work for you?
SlackHQ	720579785446014977	2016-04-14T11:49:43	lauramalarkey Great to hear! Let us know if there's anything we can help with! 👋

SlackHQ	720579376878854144	2016-04-14T11:48:05	al_x_mq What seems to be the trouble?

SlackHQ	720578523434500096	2016-04-14T11:44:42	simonjeavons Refreshing Slack with Cmd R (Mac) or Ctrl R (Windows) should take a duster to those archived cobwebs ✨
SlackHQ	720578063776538628	2016-04-14T11:42:52	SeanParkRoss Understood. We realize it's not an ideal work-around, sorry.
SlackHQ	720577868150009857	2016-04-14T11:42:06	MasterOfBoulet They'll need to allow access for you to connect on that network, sorry. We're at feedback@slack.com for detailed support.
SlackHQ	720577675363020800	2016-04-14T11:41:20	SeanParkRoss In the meantime, you could ask for an emoji reaction to important messages. That might help prevent the "." problem.
SlackHQ	720575497911070720	2016-04-14T11:32:41	preeta82 No and yes! Stars? Or create a to-do channel (and use pins)? Or a Post with a checklist? 
SlackHQ	720574213187362816	2016-04-14T11:27:34	parfittmark You can have 5 per paid member. If you upgrade one to a Multi-Channel Guest, you'll get 5 more

SlackHQ	720569776058331136	2016-04-14T11:09:56	thieman nick_schultz You can always add custom emoji in the meantime: 
SlackHQ	720568384853774336	2016-04-14T11:04:25	jonbmetz We're very sorry to hear that and will make sure that feedback is passed along. Thanks for flagging it. 🙌
SlackHQ	720567842589011968	2016-04-14T11:02:15	jdjohnson So little to do, and so much time! Wait — that isn't right. Sorry, it really is on our list, but it's a very very long list 😱
SlackHQ	720566772643074048	2016-04-14T10:58:00	AllyBFraz Hi there! 👋 Anything we can clarify? Here isn't a bad place to start: 
SlackHQ	720566469633970176	2016-04-14T10:56:48	josefmtz We worry a bit that this might make pins less useful, but something to think about! We'll make a note for the team.
SlackHQ	720564430333984768	2016-04-14T10:48:42	goldenhawkftw And if they're ever enabled, Slackbot will let you know 
SlackHQ	720564222216794112	2016-04-14T10:47:52	goldenhawkftw Generally no — and never easily. It's only possible for the small minority of teams who've compliance exports enabled (1/2)
SlackHQ	720563863452852224	2016-04-14T10:46:27	mattepp Sorry about that! Do you mind dropping an example to feedback@slack.com — we'll take a look.
SlackHQ	720563298400346112	2016-04-14T10:44:12	bokayio Makes sense to leave it to the recipient to choose, no? But perhaps we're missing something! 👂
SlackHQ	720562514556239873	2016-04-14T10:41:05	aurynn Sorry for the slow performance! If you drop us a line to feedback@slack.com we'll gladly investigate.
SlackHQ	720562152680120320	2016-04-14T10:39:39	JonSilvaJS Must admit, this is a bit further down our to-do list, but perhaps someone will build an app. ⎮       ▫️            ⎮
SlackHQ	720561425895329792	2016-04-14T10:36:45	justnotchuck Sorry about that! There's only so much screen real estate to play with. Should we be doing this differently, do you think?
SlackHQ	720560649743503360	2016-04-14T10:33:40	hylores (We'll make sure this is covered in our Help Center ASAP, sorry)
SlackHQ	720560577941258240	2016-04-14T10:33:23	hylores This can be done by owners and admins, but only for the general channel (renamed in this case):

SlackHQ	720558887766769664	2016-04-14T10:26:40	KulkarniApoorv Shouldn't do — nope!
SlackHQ	720558650004258816	2016-04-14T10:25:44	chimeracoder Not team-wide, but you can suppress these notifications from each channel's Notification Preferences 
SlackHQ	720557653802557441	2016-04-14T10:21:46	cassigallagher The tab key will put the last command used in the message input box. Could that be it, sorry?
SlackHQ	720557325069783040	2016-04-14T10:20:28	kimjimenez There isn't, sorry! Something to think about! Would polite notices in your general channel help, perhaps?
SlackHQ	720557099684655104	2016-04-14T10:19:34	fmcorey Six of one? Sorry! What would you like to see?

SlackHQ	720234266647470080	2016-04-13T12:56:45	vladciurca The "Let others edit this Post" option may need to be selected, possibly? There's more about that here:

SlackHQ	720213011965853696	2016-04-13T11:32:17	AndiCRadu Posts sound ideal! You can take it in turns to edit, and use checklist formatting: 
SlackHQ	720198392228540416	2016-04-13T10:34:12	IPWright We prioritized calls first, but screen-sharing is certainly in the pipeline. Thanks!

SlackHQ	719998777017384960	2016-04-12T21:21:00	d_aghassi 🤔 Are you logged into multiple teams? If you try quitting and re-launching the app, does that help at all?
SlackHQ	719998392697556993	2016-04-12T21:19:28	MrsFridayNext The messages can be recovered if your team upgrades to a paid plan, or if older messages are deleted to get under the limit 👍

SlackHQ	719994923731312640	2016-04-12T21:05:41	BryantD  Ah, we see what you mean. Did you have the option to sign in via Magic Link instead?
SlackHQ	719992808392781824	2016-04-12T20:57:16	jbenton Zapier or IFTTT would be your best bets for that! ✨
SlackHQ	719991747464601601	2016-04-12T20:53:04	autrey It was a design choice, but we can see how it would be handy to be able to run it side by side. We'll give it more thought 👍💖
SlackHQ	719989514442289153	2016-04-12T20:44:11	VonStage Sounds like a preference: could you try System Preferences &gt; Slack &gt; Notifications and uncheck Show notifications on lock screen?

SlackHQ	719985318552870912	2016-04-12T20:27:31	ncalexander Are you seeing unread badges in general that shouldn't be there? Or it this happening specifically with join/leave messages? 🤔
SlackHQ	719984933310197760	2016-04-12T20:25:59	bdimcheff Currently, the best way is just from the archive pages, though we know that doesn't look too pretty. We'll give it more thought!
SlackHQ	719984732252082176	2016-04-12T20:25:11	PimDeWitte We're sorry! This is definitely something we're working on. For now, can you try choosing teams from the Window menu instead? 🙏

SlackHQ	719973485095817217	2016-04-12T19:40:29	upso Aha! So like the clearly-could-be-more-discoverable "Your Files" in the top right pulldown? 😬

SlackHQ	719711901798817794	2016-04-12T02:21:03	AshKyd There isn't a way to remove old content, sadly. You can collapse attachments with /collapse, or use shift-esc to clear unreads.
