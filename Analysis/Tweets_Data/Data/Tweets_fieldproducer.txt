fieldproducer	715550998929006592	2016-03-31T14:47:07	MikeIsaac lheron we need to hold these platforms to greater account on what a 'view' is. Shift needs to be to engagement time &amp; completion

fieldproducer	714471464108425216	2016-03-28T15:17:25	mathewi worth looking into, Sky's hold on the football was a reason to own it for many - now BT has gone in heavy.
fieldproducer	714470792097042433	2016-03-28T15:14:45	mathewi that's before you take into account what's happening in the UK, where a broadband network - BT has a lot of football rights.

fieldproducer	713950427889446912	2016-03-27T04:47:01	FredPawle jonswaine jamesjonestv indeed, Fred knows more about the ocean than most will ever know.Lack of education leads to many deaths.
fieldproducer	713918892293361665	2016-03-27T02:41:42	jonswaine jamesjonestv why because I have pointed out how the media let's down people in. These situations? Sorry Jon, that's a joke.
fieldproducer	713918529729404929	2016-03-27T02:40:16	jamesjonestv jonswaine we teach nobody that in the UK and it lets down every person in that situation.
fieldproducer	713918279627177989	2016-03-27T02:39:16	jamesjonestv jonswaine you sit in a rip you leave a rip it's that easy. Lives could be saved on that alone.
fieldproducer	713918068485959680	2016-03-27T02:38:26	jamesjonestv jonswaine they clearly knew nothing and that's the point
fieldproducer	713917966732107776	2016-03-27T02:38:01	jamesjonestv jonswaine indeed horrific,but my point is  important thing is what should you do in a rip?How do we stop it happening again.
fieldproducer	713916888984784899	2016-03-27T02:33:44	jonswaine jamesjonestv sorry Jon, that's unfair - this article is important but we need to at least explain how to spot a killer.
fieldproducer	713916349316206592	2016-03-27T02:31:36	jamesjonestv jonswaine do either of you know how to spot them? Do my friends no. It's awful and we could help those that travel.
fieldproducer	713916154931191808	2016-03-27T02:30:49	jamesjonestv jonswaine no I'm saying in the UK we're not even taught about them, they kill - they are easy to spot
fieldproducer	713915586221326338	2016-03-27T02:28:34	jonswaine jamesjonestv I'm not I'm saying we're not taught about how to spot rips &amp; Brits die every year because of it
fieldproducer	713915060758962176	2016-03-27T02:26:29	jamesjonestv jonswaine I'm saying rips are very easy to spot, we spot them every day &amp; use them - but lack of education leads to this.
fieldproducer	713914085767847939	2016-03-27T02:22:36	jonswaine jamesjonestv most people don't even know how rips work, we use them to get out to surf, if you know rips you ride them
fieldproducer	713913571160272897	2016-03-27T02:20:33	jonswaine jamesjonestv I have pulled kids out who have been in the shallows with rips near - most people don't know what a rip even is

fieldproducer	713912203745824769	2016-03-27T02:15:07	jamesjonestv guardian sorry, I've had to stop this instance happening about 3 times in the last year or so. It is the sad thing about it
fieldproducer	713882021974687744	2016-03-27T00:15:11	Many countries could learn from Australia in teaching their young about water safety,rips can be your friend - you just know how to use then
fieldproducer	713881342749097985	2016-03-27T00:12:30	Sad thing about this is its yet another person lost to a rip,something anyone who knows water know how to deal with

fieldproducer	713131617414483969	2016-03-24T22:33:21	mobile_reach you'd be surprised on some of the data from some orgs I have seen, we're talking less than 10% that start process
fieldproducer	713110970391007238	2016-03-24T21:11:18	mobile_reach just using to subscribe would be better than most mobile interfaces,many lose a lot of potential subscribers who start process

fieldproducer	713072851918667776	2016-03-24T18:39:50	Also Playboy is more popular abroad than in the U.S. Has been targeting consumer products in China. 
fieldproducer	713072132339707904	2016-03-24T18:36:59	Playboy will argue brand is its most valuable asset. Has said  bunny is more widely recognized than Nike swoosh.
