KBAndersen	704148462640746496	2016-02-29T03:37:30	Best Adherence to Historical Facts 
KBAndersen	704147028746637313	2016-02-29T03:31:48	Yep. (Although if you want to be more bored than you've ever been by a movie, go see Knight of Cups next weekend.) 
KBAndersen	704145844702990337	2016-02-29T03:27:06	Shockingly mean. And great.
KBAndersen	704145385640599554	2016-02-29T03:25:16	As a 20-second trailer, Bridge of Spies looks good. And yet.

KBAndersen	704141977638535169	2016-02-29T03:11:44	So no one said: droids and Minions and Toy Story characters all in the same segment?
KBAndersen	704138739027734528	2016-02-29T02:58:52	Oh, hey! ExMachinaMovie has 2 Oscars. Kurt's conversation with Alex Garland: 
KBAndersen	704139322782556161	2016-02-29T03:01:11	Droid segments suck Oscars
KBAndersen	704138280372142080	2016-02-29T02:57:02	True story. Right before Oscars nominations, I bet George Miller $50 he'd get a bunch. Soon as he did, he emailed me to arrange payment.
KBAndersen	704134418517073922	2016-02-29T02:41:42	"Best reviewed movie of 2015." Odd. Old-school.

KBAndersen	704125593487548416	2016-02-29T02:06:38	Maybe. But Shirley Bassey's Goldfinger? 
KBAndersen	704123369097183232	2016-02-29T01:57:47	Impressive. You were 11. 
KBAndersen	704122265798057984	2016-02-29T01:53:24	This won me a square on Studio360show awardsbingo.
KBAndersen	704121551449432064	2016-02-29T01:50:34	Unusually good writing. (BTW, Russell Crowe is only 51.)

KBAndersen	704106463027978240	2016-02-29T00:50:37	I have my digital AwardsBingo card, all ready to play. You can too:  It is not un-fun, I promise.
KBAndersen	704105790467080194	2016-02-29T00:47:56	It's a mausoleum. Isn't that kind of inherently religious? 
KBAndersen	703983185537966081	2016-02-28T16:40:45	Just occurred to me: the theming of one of Trump's most spectacular failures, the Taj Mahal casino, was based on a....MUSLIM religious site.
KBAndersen	703941913750192128	2016-02-28T13:56:45	Cruz campaign co-chair: any evangelicals who vote for Trump are "hypocritical or uninformed," "lack discernment, judgment and temperament.‚Äù

KBAndersen	703377874485698561	2016-02-27T00:35:28	How about rabble? Does that work? 
KBAndersen	703413424894693376	2016-02-27T02:56:43	Grateful for any small bit of candor in political discourse. Like WSJ editorial calling tedcruz "a factional candidate of the far right."
KBAndersen	703356917796749315	2016-02-26T23:12:11	And BTW, 2 of the 44 non-whites among the Most Powerful Americans are Marco Rubio &amp; Ted Cruz. 
KBAndersen	703356365729832961	2016-02-26T23:09:59	Nicely done. The Faces of American Power, Nearly as White as the Oscar Nominees: 503 most powerful people. 91% white 
KBAndersen	703352200945344513	2016-02-26T22:53:27	Vietnam made America crazy. Iraq--&amp; again not winning--seemed less consequential at the time. But maybe a source of current crazification?
KBAndersen	703345217043308549	2016-02-26T22:25:41	Sanders voters are called na√Øve. Trump's the anti-na√Øf, so we don't call his voters that. But most are. Need a new word for hateful na√Øvet√©.
KBAndersen	703340365097648128	2016-02-26T22:06:25	OK. But Trump voters were far more anti-emancipation &amp; pro-Confederacy than Bush &amp; Kasich ones. Which seems salient. 
KBAndersen	703290956162998278	2016-02-26T18:50:05	Really wonder what rupertmurdoch's thinking &amp; feeling: realDonaldTrump's creator via nypost &amp; especially FoxNews, his nemesis via WSJ.
KBAndersen	703281386162135040	2016-02-26T18:12:03	Earlier I noted uncanny similarity of Downton Abbey theme to Phil Glass' The Hours. Also: Michael Nyman's The Piano

KBAndersen	703063334917181441	2016-02-26T03:45:35	Really interesting Trump actually knows the border with Canada is 4 times as long as the one with Mexico. He's though about a wall there?

KBAndersen	703054977858727936	2016-02-26T03:12:23	Subtlety of a kind? 
KBAndersen	703054192382967809	2016-02-26T03:09:16	Cruz wants to abolish the IRS, a stupid undoable thing. Trump feels the pain of the IRS: relatable. 
KBAndersen	703052894975696896	2016-02-26T03:04:06	#24 in talk radio shows:  
KBAndersen	703052281802039296	2016-02-26T03:01:40	Ted Cruz, who wants to abolish the IRS, suggests Trump being audited means he's fishy?
KBAndersen	703050815607435265	2016-02-26T02:55:51	DO NOT go anti-raisin. Do not. 
KBAndersen	703049457873592325	2016-02-26T02:50:27	Cruz accuses Trump of refusing to let people die in the streets for lack of healthcare coverage. Low blow.
KBAndersen	703047192949424128	2016-02-26T02:41:27	Rubio slagging Trump for lacking detail is like Dukakis &amp; Mondale slagging Reagan.
KBAndersen	703045709080215552	2016-02-26T02:35:33	Yes. 
KBAndersen	703045123060441088	2016-02-26T02:33:13	I think Kasich would probably beat Clinton.
KBAndersen	703044299307536384	2016-02-26T02:29:57	When Trump calls Cruz "a crazy zealot," I can't totally hate him.
KBAndersen	703043120582270976	2016-02-26T02:25:16	John Roberts, effing liberal.
KBAndersen	703041257870909440	2016-02-26T02:17:52	The impossibility of Kasich (like Bush) in today's GOP is tragic.
KBAndersen	703040909324230656	2016-02-26T02:16:29	In the novel, not the movies. So it doesn't matter. 
KBAndersen	703039948580999168	2016-02-26T02:12:40	They've literally been arguing for 45 minutes over who will kick out Mexicans best. GOPDebate

KBAndersen	703038506524942336	2016-02-26T02:06:56	Love. Love Love.
KBAndersen	703037010630545408	2016-02-26T02:00:59	Like in Who Framed Roger Rabbit? it's hard for the humans to deal with the cartoon characters, but entertaining.

KBAndersen	703033931139031040	2016-02-26T01:48:45	The Good Ones is a great psychedelic-pop band name.
KBAndersen	703033879691657216	2016-02-26T01:48:33	Hilarious. Horrible, but hilarious.
KBAndersen	703033496940507136	2016-02-26T01:47:02	Presidential Trump. 
KBAndersen	703032682373103616	2016-02-26T01:43:47	Love that "the candidates requested" the warning bell.
KBAndersen	703032150938034176	2016-02-26T01:41:41	You're not alone here on the information superhighway. The Purge ad was awesome. 
KBAndersen	703008070566342658	2016-02-26T00:05:59	This piece about Trump as the GOP's own monstrous creation deserves all the buzz. Magnificent. Bravo, Robert Kagan. 
KBAndersen	702866492564627456	2016-02-25T14:43:25	In some instances at the high end (e.g. postmodern architecture) it *started* as irony. But it's mostly unconscious. 
KBAndersen	702698863161958400	2016-02-25T03:37:19	Been thinking of this film a lot lately. "Idiocracy writer: I never expected my movie 'to become a documentary'" 
KBAndersen	702695068466024448	2016-02-25T03:22:14	Nope, it's an actual thing. 1996 looks &amp; sounds to us now lots more like 2016 than '76 did in '96, '56 in '76 &amp; etc. 
KBAndersen	702655990550929408	2016-02-25T00:46:57	OK, they don't look 2016. But NOT 37-years-ago--the way, eg, 1963 did in 2000. A hobbyhorse:  
KBAndersen	702612186963779584	2016-02-24T21:52:53	Go in peace. Do your best. Write as if Trump isn't the beloved father-in-law of your  owner. But I don't envy you. 
KBAndersen	702582946503401472	2016-02-24T19:56:42	Not a troll. But: straight, "objective" Trump coverage in paper with strong POV as  raison d'etre seems...untenable? 
KBAndersen	702572782576599040	2016-02-24T19:16:19	You certainly do, anyhow, as his son-in-law's national political reporter. Sincerely curious: how's that work? 
KBAndersen	702570638129668097	2016-02-24T19:07:47	This is a fervent Trump supporter. This is how argument operates in Fantasyland. 
KBAndersen	702536505613541376	2016-02-24T16:52:10	Plenty of subtle, systemic, unconscious racism everywhere. But admitting &amp; celebrating white supremacy's better? No. 
KBAndersen	702530914258198528	2016-02-24T16:29:57	Thanks. 
KBAndersen	702530705423769601	2016-02-24T16:29:07	Yes: a grotesque fraction of a (GOP) fraction. But more than 2%. And appalling to see them galvanized &amp; empowered. 
KBAndersen	702515171311427585	2016-02-24T15:27:23	Since the 2016 election has now become entirely lurid fiction, I choose to start believing billclinton once slept with MELANIATRUMP.
KBAndersen	702480392339722241	2016-02-24T13:09:11	Trump's South Carolina voters on the Civil War: 38% say they wish the South had won &amp; 20% that slavery hadn't ended 
KBAndersen	702335678982590464	2016-02-24T03:34:09	Meta-irony: the GOP's sketchy caucuses in Nevada are retroactively justifying the party's otherwise fraudulent claims about voter fraud.

KBAndersen	702296367792791552	2016-02-24T00:57:56	Of course there were causes. (I'll give you Viet Nam &amp; Watergate.) Problem: mistrust became default, then pathology. 
KBAndersen	702294674191556611	2016-02-24T00:51:12	Looking at NV caucus candidate list gave me an idea for a bar bet: is RealBenCarson still running for president? Yours to use. But hurry.
KBAndersen	702263034585153536	2016-02-23T22:45:29	Our fearless leader KBAndersen interviewed every Oscar nominated director. üíêüé•üèÜListen here:  
KBAndersen	702261501801926657	2016-02-23T22:39:24	True. The left teed up that mistrust in the 1960s &amp; 70s, and the right has taken it over the top since. 
KBAndersen	702258447778054144	2016-02-23T22:27:15	The crit buzzword of my youth was "subversive." Then came transgressive. Now it's immersive. I've spent 35 years in a Cole Porter lyric.
KBAndersen	702259714625822722	2016-02-23T22:32:17	I compared him to one of THE most beloved, famous, successful Americans ever. He should make me Secretary of Kultur. 
KBAndersen	702259355022917634	2016-02-23T22:30:52	OK, how about pseudo-semi-British with vestigial mid-Atlantic accent? 
KBAndersen	702247354267729920	2016-02-23T21:43:11	And a British-seeming, French-speaking patrician white dude at that. It's the Sykes-Picot Centennial Celebration! 
KBAndersen	702245739536244736	2016-02-23T21:36:46	Trump isn't a real NYC powerbroker:  He's our Buffalo Bill, who PLAYED a scout/killer for 40 years after he was one.
KBAndersen	702241293909495809	2016-02-23T21:19:06	Bad day for sex. It may transmit the Zika virus:  And, at least in dogs, cancer:

KBAndersen	702160898232860676	2016-02-23T15:59:38	Trump: angry, mean, decadent Reagan. liberal history, multi-wives, show-biz fame, charisma, nationalism, anti-wonk.  
KBAndersen	702131561681051648	2016-02-23T14:03:03	Our pleasure! (Hope the thoughts and ideas turn out to be superior to the banana pie.) 
KBAndersen	701910224429588481	2016-02-22T23:23:33	That's the famous line. From back when a party led by the likes of Trump was unimaginable. Except by Sinclair Lewis. 
KBAndersen	701878274985689088	2016-02-22T21:16:35	3rd Law of politics: equal opposite reaction. JFK opposite Ike, Carter of Nixon, Reagan of Carter, Obama of Bush &amp; X of Obama. So: X=Trump?
KBAndersen	701876242698649600	2016-02-22T21:08:31	Some Republicans have fretted for a while that theirs was turning into "the stupid party." So...Trump.
KBAndersen	701805814756065280	2016-02-22T16:28:39	You think he's already compiling his Enemies List? (See: Nixon, Richard, 1971.) 
KBAndersen	701799602379485184	2016-02-22T16:03:58	True-ish conventional wisdom. My hunch: more this time. E.g. people I know who'd vote Trump vs HRC but HRC vs Cruz. 
KBAndersen	701795477264711680	2016-02-22T15:47:35	VERY proud of new Studio360show about movies--OscarSoWhite, Boston accents, revival of Westerns, more. Hear here: 
KBAndersen	701780915152941057	2016-02-22T14:49:43	Doubt it was planned, but if Trump is nominated his GOP heresies re Iraq &amp; social welfare will only help him in November with swing voters.
KBAndersen	701447220462227456	2016-02-21T16:43:44	So gorgeous. So wish I'd been there. 
KBAndersen	701260963190874113	2016-02-21T04:23:37	Really enjoyed our studio360 conversation, Wendell. Thanks again. 
KBAndersen	700864627459104768	2016-02-20T02:08:43	No, he says he's making the best case he can, and dissembling a bit. As we all sometimes do. Especially CEOs &amp; such. 
KBAndersen	700863967305080832	2016-02-20T02:06:05	Ethics means good ends *never* justify problematic means? No. In fact, in the non-saintly real world, the opposite. 
KBAndersen	700863221574582276	2016-02-20T02:03:08	Very. 
KBAndersen	700863154281127937	2016-02-20T02:02:52	So, serial: new episodes are so great--and 2 in 1 week!--I hereby apologize for being peevish about the biweekly shift. Keep being great.
