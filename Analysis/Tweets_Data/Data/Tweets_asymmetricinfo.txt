asymmetricinfo	705972655095021568	2016-03-05T04:26:11	EricaGrieder And on that happy note, I’m going to hang out with my husband and our houseguest and rest up for tomorrow’s excitement!
asymmetricinfo	705972481291481089	2016-03-05T04:25:30	EricaGrieder I don’t think he failed to step up before. i think that unlike Cruz, he was campaigning in very crowded lane, which hurt him.
asymmetricinfo	705972235022938112	2016-03-05T04:24:31	EricaGrieder For the record, I think moving into OH and FL is crazy on both counts. But what do I know? I don’t have to campaign, thank god
asymmetricinfo	705972068534218752	2016-03-05T04:23:52	Brendan_m_Hodge cbradleytodd Oh, crap, you are right.
asymmetricinfo	705972005158285312	2016-03-05T04:23:37	EricaGrieder If Cruz had been taking these kinds of blows, he’d be having  much, much harder time than he is.
asymmetricinfo	705971806797172736	2016-03-05T04:22:49	EricaGrieder Belittling him as a lesser campaigner than Cruz is neither fair nor correct.
asymmetricinfo	705971723259129857	2016-03-05T04:22:29	EricaGrieder But the point is that Rubio has, from four different candidates, drawn withering &amp; sustained attack. Cruz hasn’t.
asymmetricinfo	705971610688233472	2016-03-05T04:22:02	EricaGrieder To be fair, Rubio only attacked Trump when there was no other choice.
asymmetricinfo	705971533781467136	2016-03-05T04:21:44	EricaGrieder Rubio actually went after Trump &amp; drew fire. Cruz drew fire when IA evangelicals went gaga over him. It was hardly bravery.
asymmetricinfo	705971296559955968	2016-03-05T04:20:48	EricaGrieder ErinRehman That’s not clear to me at all. I expect folks are now looking to 2020, and hoping that they don’t have to face him
asymmetricinfo	705970925116608512	2016-03-05T04:19:19	EricaGrieder Not as much as Christie OR Kasich cost Rubio. Not even a little bit. Moreover, it’s not like Cruz started it.
asymmetricinfo	705970638624690176	2016-03-05T04:18:11	ErinRehman EricaGrieder Whereas there’s a point to campaigning in TX if you have a shot at 20%, as Rubio obviously did.
asymmetricinfo	705970519871389696	2016-03-05T04:17:42	ErinRehman EricaGrieder But Florida’s just WTA. If you’ve no shot, campaigning there is just vindictive.
asymmetricinfo	705970171433758720	2016-03-05T04:16:19	EricaGrieder Just sayin’. :)
asymmetricinfo	705969916927569920	2016-03-05T04:15:19	EricaGrieder Cruz had a few debate zingers from Trump, who has spent almost no money. Rubio had Christie, Bush, Kasich, Trump out for blood
asymmetricinfo	705969597573279744	2016-03-05T04:14:02	EricaGrieder Cruz has run a good campaign. But he has overcome maybe a third of the obstacles Rubio had.
asymmetricinfo	705969472914391040	2016-03-05T04:13:33	EricaGrieder Yes. Before that, he went after Jeb harder than Cruz. Much harder.
asymmetricinfo	705969153941774336	2016-03-05T04:12:17	EricaGrieder Not nearly the intensity that Rubio has endured from multiple people, including Trump.
asymmetricinfo	705968497394749440	2016-03-05T04:09:40	EricaGrieder Then after Rubio started hitting him hard, Cruz landed a few decorous punches.
asymmetricinfo	705968413047279616	2016-03-05T04:09:20	EricaGrieder C’mon. He did not attack Trump; he sucked up to him in early debates. He didn’t want to take that fire; left it to the FL guys
asymmetricinfo	705968125401890820	2016-03-05T04:08:12	EricaGrieder Nor did Ted Cruz. Everyone was focused on taking out Rubio to clear the way for themselves.
asymmetricinfo	705968010914242560	2016-03-05T04:07:44	EricaGrieder And he didn’t face four credible contenders for one slot. He faced … Huckabee &amp; Carson.
asymmetricinfo	705967642088083456	2016-03-05T04:06:16	EricaGrieder That’s not to take away from Cruz, who has run a very tight campaign. But Rubio has been hit in a way Cruz just hasn’t.
asymmetricinfo	705967487104356352	2016-03-05T04:05:39	EricaGrieder I sincerely doubt Cruz would look so good with $100 million in SuperPac money, Chris Christie hitting him, and a K in his lane
asymmetricinfo	705967278274129920	2016-03-05T04:04:50	EricaGrieder He’s let Rubio take all the risks while playing above the fray, and now his campaign says Rubio can’t play in the varsity?
asymmetricinfo	705966971796353024	2016-03-05T04:03:36	EricaGrieder If Cruz is even still in this race it’s because Rubio leaned into the strike zone and changed the narrative last Thursday.
asymmetricinfo	705966882122149889	2016-03-05T04:03:15	EricaGrieder I think that’s silly. Rubio has had more energy focused on taking him out than any other candidate.
asymmetricinfo	705966630078013440	2016-03-05T04:02:15	ErinRehman EricaGrieder Once again, FL is winner take all. There’s no prize for second place.
asymmetricinfo	705966401173848065	2016-03-05T04:01:20	EricaGrieder &amp; Dems probably take White House, Senate, maybe House, blow away filibuster, leaving TC basically talking to himself.
asymmetricinfo	705966200245735426	2016-03-05T04:00:33	EricaGrieder Though in this case, I think this is also catastrophically risky for TC; unless he or Rubio wins FL, it’s probably over.
asymmetricinfo	705966080045416448	2016-03-05T04:00:04	EricaGrieder … &amp; is therefore willing to do things that are catastrophically risky for his party if there’s a small potential upside for TC
asymmetricinfo	705965929318854656	2016-03-05T03:59:28	EricaGrieder You can also tell a story where Ted Cruz values things that happen to anyone except Ted Cruz at zero.
asymmetricinfo	705965811102429188	2016-03-05T03:59:00	EricaGrieder You can tell a story where he’s a genius campaigner who’s done better than anyone thought.
asymmetricinfo	705965705255002112	2016-03-05T03:58:34	ErinRehman EricaGrieder DemonNinjaLlama No, Rubio fought in TX because unlike FL and OH it’s not winner take all &amp; has a lot of delegates
asymmetricinfo	705965479618154496	2016-03-05T03:57:41	GeenaMidtown It doesn’t work that way. Those states are winner take all: top in the polls gets all the delegates in Cleveland.
asymmetricinfo	705965363515641857	2016-03-05T03:57:13	EricaGrieder Ohio only has 66 delegates, so it matters a lot less.
asymmetricinfo	705965276026634240	2016-03-05T03:56:52	EricaGrieder DemonNinjaLlama Like I said, two tiny caucus states, Texas, and (with apologies) North Texas.
asymmetricinfo	705962388265238529	2016-03-05T03:45:24	EricaGrieder Thought he just announced he was making a play for Ohio and Florida, not just FL.
asymmetricinfo	705959096059568129	2016-03-05T03:32:19	EricaGrieder I’d guess he thinks the polling favors him too. I also don’t think he can make up 20 points in 12 days with Rubio all in on FL
asymmetricinfo	705958867004473344	2016-03-05T03:31:24	cbradleytodd Ohio looks better for him, except it only has 66 delegates compared to Florida’s 246.
asymmetricinfo	705958744362979328	2016-03-05T03:30:55	AlexGodofsky Because at this point, most likely path to win is to consolidate Anyone But Trump lane in your state.
asymmetricinfo	705958389021589505	2016-03-05T03:29:30	Sharpe222 Especially since NYS seems likely to go Trump.
asymmetricinfo	705958229826805760	2016-03-05T03:28:52	Sharpe222 Since none of the other big states are WTA, not really seeing where he makes that up.
asymmetricinfo	705958136163778565	2016-03-05T03:28:30	Sharpe222 Florida has 246 delegates. If he can’t win them—and I don’t see how he can—he leaves Trump halfway to nomination
asymmetricinfo	705957564496879616	2016-03-05T03:26:14	MovementCon Seems more like the opposite: he wants to take out Rubio, thinks somehow he knocks both out and ends up the clean nominee.
asymmetricinfo	705957402307371008	2016-03-05T03:25:35	MovementCon He needs to gain 30 points in Florida in less than 2 weeks. Not seeing it.
asymmetricinfo	705957259021565952	2016-03-05T03:25:01	EricaGrieder And therefore you, the guy with 12 points, want to make a play there? Color me skeptical.
asymmetricinfo	705957056159813633	2016-03-05T03:24:12	This is less a judgment about TCruz than a note that a) Ohio, especially, isn’t his territory and b) he’s got 12 days to gain 30 pts in FL
asymmetricinfo	705956053113020416	2016-03-05T03:20:13	Personally, I’m pretty sure that Cruz can’t pull it off, and will ensure that Trump wins the nomination.
asymmetricinfo	705955435086536704	2016-03-05T03:17:46	In making a play for Florida and Ohio, Cruz is going for broke. If he pulls it off, he can secure the nomination. If he loses, Trump gets it
asymmetricinfo	705916072323469312	2016-03-05T00:41:21	If you’re wondering why establishment doesn’t just get behind Cruz, I explain here: they think they’re out of time

asymmetricinfo	705871846114258944	2016-03-04T21:45:37	Ted Cruz really likes repetitive lines where the end varies. Ted Cruz really likes speeches with refrains. Ted Cruz really likes anaphora.
asymmetricinfo	705870812977500161	2016-03-04T21:41:30	EricaGrieder That still leaves Trump in the pole position.

asymmetricinfo	705870024846741504	2016-03-04T21:38:23	Markos_Anderson Because Texas has huge numbers of delegates, and unlike FL, it’s not winner-take-all. Trying to hit 20% delegate threshold
asymmetricinfo	705869530556407809	2016-03-04T21:36:25	Markos_Anderson See my column on strategic voting, going up soon. If they want a shot at the nomination, all should help each other stop T
asymmetricinfo	705869357117739008	2016-03-04T21:35:43	brownmp baseballcrank sunnyright No, he’s really not, because there’s no chance he picks up all Rubio’s vote.
asymmetricinfo	705868989558366208	2016-03-04T21:34:16	Sh3ppey No one’s suggesting he should drop out. It’s no longer a fight to to win the primaries. It’s a fight to force a brokered convention
asymmetricinfo	705868712507809794	2016-03-04T21:33:10	Dextera76 If Rubio gets out, that means Kasich stays in. It’s not a three man race.
asymmetricinfo	705868622854545410	2016-03-04T21:32:48	Dextera76 Why do all the Cruz fans think all his votes go to Cruz? A not-insignificant portion go to Kasich, leaving Cruz short of Trump.
asymmetricinfo	705867492334432258	2016-03-04T21:28:19	EricaGrieder I’m … skeptical. Very skeptical. Look at who Jersey Republicans are.

asymmetricinfo	705867304643465217	2016-03-04T21:27:34	Dextera76 This is silly. As his fight back from that has proven, while Kasich has tanked.
asymmetricinfo	705864968487477249	2016-03-04T21:18:17	EricaGrieder He did a good job there. But it’s not hostile territory like, say, the mid-Atlantic is.
asymmetricinfo	705864845380460545	2016-03-04T21:17:48	EricaGrieder Or so a Floridian relation tells me.
asymmetricinfo	705864678581379072	2016-03-04T21:17:08	EricaGrieder They’re mad he used the state as a stepping stone to higher office too quickly.
asymmetricinfo	705864523404742657	2016-03-04T21:16:31	EricaGrieder Yes, but, it’s got a huge evangelical base, hence Huckabee.
asymmetricinfo	705863662788087808	2016-03-04T21:13:06	I am beginning to think that the main priority of all non-Trump candidates in primary is ensuring Rubio loses, no matter who wins.
asymmetricinfo	705863354208952320	2016-03-04T21:11:52	coshoct EricaGrieder Again, doesn’t help if Kasich picks up a lot of his votes, as he will … but not enough to win.
asymmetricinfo	705863225963909120	2016-03-04T21:11:22	EricaGrieder Instead, Cruz is trying to cost R Florida, which makes K exit even less likely, and T outright nomination much more likely.
asymmetricinfo	705863086822039552	2016-03-04T21:10:48	EricaGrieder Then the best possible scenario for NeverTrump folks is: Kasich wins Ohio, R wins FL, then K leaves, C&amp;R collude.
asymmetricinfo	705862950381338624	2016-03-04T21:10:16	EricaGrieder If Trump voters start dropping, I think I agree. But if you assume they’re lost, and the battle is for the remaining 35% ...
asymmetricinfo	705862806277656578	2016-03-04T21:09:41	EricaGrieder Your strategy works if you assume that Rubio &amp; Kasich drop out at the same time. But R dropping out would give K lease on life
asymmetricinfo	705862612995670016	2016-03-04T21:08:55	EricaGrieder If it weren’t for Kasich, Rubio would probably be on track to be the nominee. But Kasich is there, and not leaving.
asymmetricinfo	705862357579407361	2016-03-04T21:07:54	EricaGrieder 2 are tiny states with caucuses, the other two are basically, Texas and North Texas.
asymmetricinfo	705862219729379329	2016-03-04T21:07:22	EricaGrieder I expect Cruz gets more than Trump, but it’s not enough to put him over the top.
asymmetricinfo	705862158404481024	2016-03-04T21:07:07	EricaGrieder If Rubio gets out, those folks will bleed to Kasich, rest divided between Cruz &amp; Trump
asymmetricinfo	705862077366280192	2016-03-04T21:06:48	EricaGrieder Model this as a race where there are a significant number of voters to whom Rubio is on the edge of acceptable “Christian-ish"
asymmetricinfo	705861948689223680	2016-03-04T21:06:17	EricaGrieder Kasich isn’t getting out. I don’t know why he isn’t, but he isn’t. So don’t model this as a three man race.
asymmetricinfo	705861813271961600	2016-03-04T21:05:45	EricaGrieder But Florida is not proportional. It’s WTA, and Cruz seems intent on screwing it up, for reasons I do not understand
asymmetricinfo	705861612960358400	2016-03-04T21:04:57	EricaGrieder And Trump is sucking up the middle-state Pennsylvania folks who would otherwise be Cruz’s potential base.
asymmetricinfo	705861355786657792	2016-03-04T21:03:56	EricaGrieder But those Philly suburbs are not voting for Cruz. They’ll go Kasich first. He’s their type.
asymmetricinfo	705861206565920770	2016-03-04T21:03:20	EricaGrieder I’m also really not seeing how he pulls Pennsylvania out. Again, Rubio might.
asymmetricinfo	705860891338797056	2016-03-04T21:02:05	EricaGrieder Well, not WTA, but WTM.
asymmetricinfo	705860718852186112	2016-03-04T21:01:24	EricaGrieder Pretty skeptical, for example, that Cruz is going to beat Kasich or Trump in California, the last big WTA state. Rubio might
asymmetricinfo	705860404413603841	2016-03-04T21:00:09	EricaGrieder The establishment half of Rubio’s support will bleed to Kasich, Cruz will still lose, Trump will win.
asymmetricinfo	705860210817163264	2016-03-04T20:59:23	EricaGrieder Therefore, yes, it is stupid for Cruz to try to ensure that Rubio loses Florida.
asymmetricinfo	705860082890887170	2016-03-04T20:58:52	EricaGrieder It’s pretty much brokered convention, or nothing.
asymmetricinfo	705860029031845888	2016-03-04T20:58:39	EricaGrieder It’s too late for the rest of the party to consolidate, especially since Kasich won’t leave.
asymmetricinfo	705859951458185216	2016-03-04T20:58:21	EricaGrieder I think anyone who thinks there’s an obvious case that the party wins if either of these guys gets out is wrong.
asymmetricinfo	705859820570681345	2016-03-04T20:57:50	EricaGrieder And it’s not clear Cruz has a path outside of the south.
asymmetricinfo	705859754778882048	2016-03-04T20:57:34	EricaGrieder Rubio, unlike Cruz, is campaigning against someone who siphons a significant portion of his base.
asymmetricinfo	705858465546248193	2016-03-04T20:52:27	EricaGrieder Or that, you know, he’ll hand a winner take all state to Trump, who will be the next nominee.

asymmetricinfo	705168742335057920	2016-03-02T23:11:44	NetConscience I mean, I guess you could just give up and elect them all the time, instead of some of the time.
asymmetricinfo	705168541478215680	2016-03-02T23:10:56	NetConscience And my argument is that they didn’t realize they were saying it to themselves.

asymmetricinfo	705168311957516289	2016-03-02T23:10:01	NetConscience This is silly. Evangelicals lose under Dems. Originalists lose under Dems. Free market types lose under Dems.

asymmetricinfo	705167739132973056	2016-03-02T23:07:45	NetConscience Then I speak to a hypothetical Trump voter. Strategy was, and remains, daft.

asymmetricinfo	705167064474980352	2016-03-02T23:05:04	NetConscience Are you going to send a message to the GOP to not amnesty the people who already have amnesty?
asymmetricinfo	705166817879322624	2016-03-02T23:04:05	NetConscience So after Hillary wins and amnesty passes, what will the fighting have gotten you?
asymmetricinfo	705166478853718016	2016-03-02T23:02:44	NetConscience Yes, and they are in the Democratic caucus that Trump voters are helping.
asymmetricinfo	705166383076806658	2016-03-02T23:02:21	NetConscience You want to win the fight, you need more voters to agree with you, not louder politicians.
asymmetricinfo	705166243402276868	2016-03-02T23:01:48	NetConscience But Trump doesn’t mean you can win those fights. You can just lose them more badly.
asymmetricinfo	705166088686977024	2016-03-02T23:01:11	NetConscience Why? Why do you think this? Why would Ryan want to lose his spot to do something that isn’t a priority for anyone?
asymmetricinfo	705165983644848128	2016-03-02T23:00:46	NetConscience … there are millions of other people in the country who disagree with you, and vote.
asymmetricinfo	705165869731737600	2016-03-02T23:00:19	NetConscience The party was not taking your vote for granted. The party was giving you what it could, considering that ...
asymmetricinfo	705165721203044352	2016-03-02T22:59:43	NetConscience Yes. But hardcore base doesn’t appreciate, because they want GOP to deliver radical change without the power to do so.
asymmetricinfo	705165532073431040	2016-03-02T22:58:58	NetConscience No one does this. If Ryan betrayed his caucus, they’d kick him out.
asymmetricinfo	705165400686915584	2016-03-02T22:58:27	NetConscience Because members would lose their seats, and they would lose their majority. This is not hard.
asymmetricinfo	705165281417687041	2016-03-02T22:57:59	NetConscience And Trump voters are helping to elect the Dem. They can tell themselves it’s not true, but they’re wrong.
asymmetricinfo	705165202082439168	2016-03-02T22:57:40	NetConscience You’re just wrong on this, I’m sorry. It is not equivalent. If you don’t like amnesty, Dems will do it, GOP won’t.
asymmetricinfo	705165061644533760	2016-03-02T22:57:06	NetConscience First is correct. Second is just wrong. There was zero appetite in GOP for doing anything.
asymmetricinfo	705164337565065216	2016-03-02T22:54:14	NetConscience It didn’t. It made it much more likely. Trump voters sent message. They should enjoy that feeling. That’s all they’ll get.
asymmetricinfo	705164157411319808	2016-03-02T22:53:31	NetConscience The watchmen are very vigilant. Sorry. No. You’re not going to convince me that this made immigration reform less likely.
asymmetricinfo	705164032639107072	2016-03-02T22:53:01	NetConscience For which, read “Never”. That’s how you don’t do things in politics. Specify vague metric that can never be satisfied.
asymmetricinfo	705163906382221312	2016-03-02T22:52:31	NetConscience *He* wasn’t toxic. *Issue* was toxic. Why he backtracked to “You know, maybe we’d do something if the border is secure"
asymmetricinfo	705163688400035840	2016-03-02T22:51:39	unusr1 Does a lot better against Hillary than Trump in head-to-heads.
asymmetricinfo	705163564647104513	2016-03-02T22:51:09	NetConscience Sorry, misread you. No, he’s not toxic. Politicians try stuff, find out it’s toxic, back off. Exactly what he did.
asymmetricinfo	705163368827633668	2016-03-02T22:50:23	NetConscience Clearly he’s not toxic? The party is in the middle of a civil war over Donald Trump. Toxic hardly begins to describe it.
asymmetricinfo	705163227391516672	2016-03-02T22:49:49	Yup. 
asymmetricinfo	705163143333474305	2016-03-02T22:49:29	NetConscience Like Social Security privatization? No way. Not in next decade, anyway. Hard to make political predictions beyond that.
asymmetricinfo	705162776340242432	2016-03-02T22:48:01	NetConscience Nor do I think that Paul Ryan would have tried to partially privatize Social Security if he’d ended up president.
asymmetricinfo	705162618781229056	2016-03-02T22:47:24	NetConscience Nope. He tried it, massive backlash from base, he had no reason to try it again.
asymmetricinfo	705162323435114496	2016-03-02T22:46:13	NetConscience This is what every person who said sending Trump “message” was going to backfire has been saying. And now it’s playing out.
asymmetricinfo	705162160297648128	2016-03-02T22:45:34	NetConscience Unless Trump costs GOP the house, Senate, in which case Dems will carpe diem and push it through.
asymmetricinfo	705161991774728192	2016-03-02T22:44:54	NetConscience No, they won’t, for all the reasons I just laid out. No one wants their name on anything that liberalizes immigration. Toxic.
asymmetricinfo	705161806927556608	2016-03-02T22:44:10	NetConscience No, he won’t, for the same reason. The base sent a message, GOP listened, it was over, like SS reform in 2005.
asymmetricinfo	705161676304285696	2016-03-02T22:43:39	NetConscience No matter which party controlled Senate. Trump, however, may cost the GOP the house because GOP voters stay home in November
asymmetricinfo	705161539897131009	2016-03-02T22:43:07	NetConscience Gang of 8 bill went down because GOP voters revolted, politicians balked. As long as GOP controlled House, it was DOA...
asymmetricinfo	705161384678596609	2016-03-02T22:42:30	NetConscience No. Amnesty long before 2016 race began. I don’t understand why Trump supporters don’t realize this.
asymmetricinfo	705161174187446272	2016-03-02T22:41:39	D_Vogan kbaxter This is like bankers buying bad mortgage bonds because the risk of a mass default was low.

asymmetricinfo	705160114970435584	2016-03-02T22:37:27	danl2620 It's part of appeal to some of his supporters. However, it has costs: they get to enjoy hearing him talking, &amp; immigration amnesty
asymmetricinfo	705159872602632193	2016-03-02T22:36:29	danl2620 And the reason he will lose is not the issues. The reason he will lose is that he appalls people on a visceral level.
asymmetricinfo	705159611305873409	2016-03-02T22:35:27	danl2620 Since Dems are worse for Trump supporters on stated marquee issues, I therefore think they are shooting themselves in the foot.

asymmetricinfo	703636251228938241	2016-02-27T17:42:09	Ed_Realist My personal take on Trump supporters is that most are the guys who are sick of being cheated by car mechanics ...

asymmetricinfo	703635266649657345	2016-02-27T17:38:15	Ed_Realist It’s not some insanely catastrophic scenario that no one is familiar with.

asymmetricinfo	703631033875472384	2016-02-27T17:21:25	Ed_Realist MarkSKrikorian The entire actual argument for Trump rests on liking to hear things said, not wanting to actually get them done.

asymmetricinfo	703630336144613376	2016-02-27T17:18:39	Ed_Realist MarkSKrikorian I’m sure some folks said this. At any given time, someone is saying almost anything you can imagine.
asymmetricinfo	703630090974994432	2016-02-27T17:17:41	Ed_Realist MarkSKrikorian Trump’s politics offer no reason to support him over HRC unless you’re a single issue voter on immigration or PC
asymmetricinfo	703629910720552960	2016-02-27T17:16:58	Ed_Realist MarkSKrikorian If they thought he was just too liberal, they’d line up behind him out of party loyalty in the end.

asymmetricinfo	703626953337806850	2016-02-27T17:05:13	Ed_Realist MarkSKrikorian The correct answer is not “Because they just love amnesty soooooooooooo much”. Nor is it Gtown cocktail parties.
