z8angela	725745382207016960	2016-04-28T17:55:57	I wonder if AMZN may follow footsteps of GOOGL NFLX. Remember DanZanger's golden rules:

z8angela	697460107194413056	2016-02-10T16:40:22	SPY closed the last exhaustion gap this am before giving up most gain. Wild swing has been seen in this downtrend ing market. Be quick!

z8angela	695702608376270848	2016-02-05T20:16:42	It's not convincing that IBD's current market outlook is Confirmed Uptrend. SPY can't stay above its SMA 21-day; many leaders got crushed.
z8angela	695353606585778176	2016-02-04T21:09:53	LNKD lost 15% on its earning report, following the steps of AMZN NFLX AAPL. Day trading remains a better way to maneuver this market.

z8angela	689469232807972864	2016-01-19T15:27:29	An oversold snapback is expected. It'd be nice to see consolidation first. Applying first-30-minute rule is good to avoid chasing big gap.
