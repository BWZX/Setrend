Blu_Horseshoe	629052542266310659	2015-08-05T22:13:07	herbgreenberg His import data channel checks were pretty epic way back in 2012 or so.
Blu_Horseshoe	629050468375887872	2015-08-05T22:04:53	MBaddie7 modestproposal1 They didn't tell us, but I think every sell-side analyst telegraphed the timing of films.
Blu_Horseshoe	629049926618619904	2015-08-05T22:02:44	modestproposal1 That's what I thought too. I figured buy-side was slightly below $7B. But media investors seem to be panicking know.
Blu_Horseshoe	629049314086645761	2015-08-05T22:00:18	modestproposal1 Right to ~$7.0B, as expected, no?
Blu_Horseshoe	629046700129275905	2015-08-05T21:49:55	modestproposal1 Negotiating in public?
Blu_Horseshoe	629042892535934976	2015-08-05T21:34:47	Hedge_FundGirl Those are very painful.
Blu_Horseshoe	629042647831855104	2015-08-05T21:33:48	eric_analytics max02050 Strongest international portfolio, heavy concentration of news and sports (which ain't DVR'd generally)?
Blu_Horseshoe	628983066229350402	2015-08-05T17:37:03	CyrusBlack3 Yup, all media stocks are. DISCA SNI AMCX CMCSA CHTR TWX FOXA CBS
Blu_Horseshoe	628958840965464070	2015-08-05T16:00:47	max02050 Makes FOXA so much more interesting tonight!
Blu_Horseshoe	628951300999352320	2015-08-05T15:30:50	LY, during 2Q14 call, TWX talked down 2H due to higher program exp's. Then delivered $1.22 in 3Q (est. $0.94) &amp; $0.98 in 4Q (est. $0.93).
Blu_Horseshoe	628949237368287232	2015-08-05T15:22:38	max02050 Agreed, sentiment obviously souring since DIS comments. But SNI DISCA TWX results do not signal any concerns, in my mind
Blu_Horseshoe	628948913878376448	2015-08-05T15:21:21	max02050 TWX did say "re-markedly on track" when asked about affiliate fee growth in FY16-18. the largest driver of LT guide.
Blu_Horseshoe	628948751932129280	2015-08-05T15:20:42	max02050 I agree that's what hit stock. But they weren't prepared to update LT guide at this point. DIS forced an expectation.
Blu_Horseshoe	628946907587592192	2015-08-05T15:13:22	max02050 Investors obviously spooked, but i think not raising guide at this point conservative (even with FX &amp; higher program exp).
Blu_Horseshoe	628945650672123904	2015-08-05T15:08:23	TWX seeing no acc'ing sub declines. Expects skinny bundles &amp; other types of non-tradition offerings can stabilize or return subs to growth
Blu_Horseshoe	628944238521286656	2015-08-05T15:02:46	TWX "higher investments and challenging comparisons will mean lower 2H15 growth vs. 1H15 growth". I view this as conservative.
Blu_Horseshoe	628943881904750593	2015-08-05T15:01:21	TWX says FX will drag subscription revenue down by 5% in 3Q, and advertising revenue by 4% in 4Q.
Blu_Horseshoe	628943712505208832	2015-08-05T15:00:40	TWX not raising guidance for FY15, even with beat, due to material drag from FX. No mention yet of cord-cutting acceleration.
Blu_Horseshoe	628930500527288320	2015-08-05T14:08:10	It would take some stones to buy FOXA tonight.
Blu_Horseshoe	628926576000958464	2015-08-05T13:52:35	TWX not raising FY15 EPS guide after big beat will be viewed more negatively after DIS report. Still likely just being conservative.
Blu_Horseshoe	628917057757822976	2015-08-05T13:14:45	modestproposal1 DIS clearly does not think the bundle will break over next 3-5 years
Blu_Horseshoe	628916862911442944	2015-08-05T13:13:59	max02050 modestproposal1 RichBTIG I agree
Blu_Horseshoe	628899987863306240	2015-08-05T12:06:56	max02050 TWX FOXA or TWX CBS seems inevitable ($TWX only major with no broadcast exposure).
Blu_Horseshoe	628898498746974208	2015-08-05T12:01:01	max02050 Since they usually don't talk about guide until 4Q call, timing was really surprising. But I guess new CFO &amp; rising expectations
Blu_Horseshoe	628897559734566912	2015-08-05T11:57:17	max02050 DIS went out of way to talk down expectations, seemed like they were trying hard to reset. Was adamant that bundle still dominant
Blu_Horseshoe	628897276967157760	2015-08-05T11:56:09	max02050 Think a lot of media sentiment hinges on what FOXA says tonight. DIS TWX FOXA best positioned for new environment but known
Blu_Horseshoe	628895587119853568	2015-08-05T11:49:26	max02050 TWX solid results but DIS putting fear of God into media investors
Blu_Horseshoe	628693116871118848	2015-08-04T22:24:54	If DIS is going to have sub challenges, I feel sorry for the more exposed media companies.
Blu_Horseshoe	628612965550440448	2015-08-04T17:06:24	Any thoughts on why KR down ~3%?
