Espngreeny	726220039288922113	2016-04-30T01:22:04	The Jets have had 5 different players lead them in passing the last 10 seasons. Need a long term answer. I like that they're trying.
Espngreeny	726212878806732800	2016-04-30T00:53:37	chrisfallica You called it. And they got him in round two. I like it a lot.
Espngreeny	726211760286474240	2016-04-30T00:49:10	The Jets still need to sign Ryan Fitzpatrick. That is paramount. But this kid is the future.
Espngreeny	726211534767165440	2016-04-30T00:48:16	This kid was a victim of his circumstances. He has a chance, a real chance, to be a good player. Jets
Espngreeny	726211015185158144	2016-04-30T00:46:13	They did it. Jets
Espngreeny	726210885031747585	2016-04-30T00:45:41	Chad!!
Espngreeny	726208569834627072	2016-04-30T00:36:30	That is a genuinely great moment. Well done all around. NFLDraft

Espngreeny	726199880591507457	2016-04-30T00:01:58	I think there is a chance the Jaguars go from 0 to 60 in one season. Absolutely love everything they're doing.
Espngreeny	726070544035008513	2016-04-29T15:28:02	On abs. And their rightful place in fashion. 
Espngreeny	726065661634433024	2016-04-29T15:08:38	When terminology escapes us. 
Espngreeny	726055901078142980	2016-04-29T14:29:50	I don't always see Mike Ditka. But when I do, I prefer him bearded. 
Espngreeny	726012434004193280	2016-04-29T11:37:07	Also. Circa 2014. Ezekiel Elliot stole my look for the red carpet. Honestly. 
Espngreeny	725875159282806785	2016-04-29T02:31:38	The time for Jets to take a QB, if they do at all, is tomorrow. None left worth taking tonight.
Espngreeny	725874766406672384	2016-04-29T02:30:05	I like the pick. Have to get after the quarterback. Safe choice. Would've liked to trade back, maybe offers weren't good enough. Jets
Espngreeny	725871741239713793	2016-04-29T02:18:03	Let's roll the dice. Myles Jack. Do it. Jets
Espngreeny	725865513935577089	2016-04-29T01:53:19	The Raiders and Jaguars could both be serious challengers in their divisions this year. So much young talent in both places.
Espngreeny	725864172928536576	2016-04-29T01:47:59	The Dolphins just got one of the five best players in the draft with the 13th pick.
Espngreeny	725856170624208897	2016-04-29T01:16:11	Had to get in front of the Giants to get Floyd. Makes sense. Though a lot of questions about the player. Bears
Espngreeny	725854105130901505	2016-04-29T01:07:59	Whomever it is that is out to get Laremy Tunsil has succeeded. That was his spot. Let's see how far he falls.
Espngreeny	725849084788113408	2016-04-29T00:48:02	That broke insanely well for Jaguars. Can't imagine they thought Ramsey would be there. A steal at number five.
Espngreeny	725848415318478849	2016-04-29T00:45:22	Zeke Elliott was the best player in college football last year. This isn't about Jerry wanting flash. This kid is great. Cowboys
Espngreeny	725846767732928516	2016-04-29T00:38:49	I love it. Cowboys Zeke
Espngreeny	725845674957389824	2016-04-29T00:34:29	The two best healthy players in the draft are available. Cowboys can't lose.
Espngreeny	725839369240612864	2016-04-29T00:09:25	Telling to me: Gruden is very lukewarm on Goff. NFLDraft
Espngreeny	725838124140642304	2016-04-29T00:04:28	Siri? Where do I get one of those shirts Zeke Elliott is wearing?  
Espngreeny	725837564318507008	2016-04-29T00:02:15	Hello? Chris? Wasn't I wearing a tie when I left the hotel? 
Espngreeny	725837222738534400	2016-04-29T00:00:53	Hello? Uber? Yes, did I leave a cheesecake in your backseat? 
Espngreeny	725836805984112640	2016-04-28T23:59:14	I smell a caption contest!!!

Espngreeny	725833425349828608	2016-04-28T23:45:48	I can't imagine what life would be like if I felt this good about my abs. 
Espngreeny	725833239340838912	2016-04-28T23:45:04	sryan03 I'd go Zeke's shirt. 
Espngreeny	725828475941167104	2016-04-28T23:26:08	NDmom I just don't think I could pull it off. Would need more time in an Orange Theory!
Espngreeny	725824411794722816	2016-04-28T23:09:59	Shefty: Browns and Cowboys making calls to get QB late in round one. I hope Jets answer the phone.

Espngreeny	725821581117681664	2016-04-28T22:58:44	I would love to see the Jets trade back. If someone wants to come up to 20 to get a quarterback, take the picks.
Espngreeny	725820730567348224	2016-04-28T22:55:21	There isn't a quarterback in this draft I would want my team to draft in round one. I sincerely hope they don't.
Espngreeny	725820562291859456	2016-04-28T22:54:41	The three best players in this draft are Zeke Elliott, Jalen Ramsey and Myles Jack.
Espngreeny	725816910873415680	2016-04-28T22:40:11	I love everything about Zeke Elliott. Except this shirt. 
Espngreeny	725707421964984320	2016-04-28T15:25:07	Trust me, watch this. mortreport 
Espngreeny	725699179364888576	2016-04-28T14:52:21	Fabulous morning filled with NFL draft discussion. Here's the Best of Mike and Mike podcast.

Espngreeny	725617622285357056	2016-04-28T09:28:17	Chicago is ready to go... 
Espngreeny	725450370655375361	2016-04-27T22:23:41	My goodness, how wonderful is that... 
Espngreeny	725449427788419072	2016-04-27T22:19:56	Awesome. dariusrucker 
Espngreeny	725442806932725761	2016-04-27T21:53:37	A huge move, yet to be made.  
Espngreeny	725442769326641154	2016-04-27T21:53:28	Sometimes, smart people say dumb things.  
Espngreeny	725442731477196801	2016-04-27T21:53:19	I love Steve Kerr, but he shouldn't have win T this award.  
Espngreeny	725405116665331714	2016-04-27T19:23:51	I think it's going to be really tough. When said and done I think there's a real chance he gets traded. 
Espngreeny	725404589781082112	2016-04-27T19:21:46	You're the second person to say that. Which episode? I don't remember that line. 
Espngreeny	725404117582155776	2016-04-27T19:19:53	But the overwhelming majority are not. The key is to not let them ruin the fun.

Espngreeny	725401274712203264	2016-04-27T19:08:35	Pilot just announced we are flying over Lansing, Michigan. And I'm really not sure what he expects us to do with that information.
Espngreeny	725400658384412673	2016-04-27T19:06:08	I am too. 
Espngreeny	725400093726265344	2016-04-27T19:03:54	My shoe game is straight flames my man. You know not of which you speak.

Espngreeny	725397944447426560	2016-04-27T18:55:21	Just came across this picture from Vegas last week and like it a lot. 
Espngreeny	725372558296662016	2016-04-27T17:14:29	Hey jaysonst - why don't you only write about the players I like and the things I'm interested in?
Espngreeny	725372259720896513	2016-04-27T17:13:18	The man is a national treasure... 
Espngreeny	725365209494343680	2016-04-27T16:45:17	I just paid $5.48 for a bottle of water at LaGuardia Airport. I mean, seriously, how did we allow that to happen?

Espngreeny	725071872430329856	2016-04-26T21:19:40	That has to be about as bad a night as any team has ever had. Clippers
Espngreeny	725071559094898689	2016-04-26T21:18:25	So, in one night the Clippers lose two legit stars and go from legit contenders to total oblivion.

Espngreeny	724700682549383170	2016-04-25T20:44:41	John makes a pick and it isn't Golden State.  
Espngreeny	724700649124990976	2016-04-25T20:44:33	This guy can coach my team anytime.  
Espngreeny	724680892745166849	2016-04-25T19:26:03	Could've been much worse.  
Espngreeny	724667082797912064	2016-04-25T18:31:10	Tough day. Brady 
Espngreeny	724662892906352640	2016-04-25T18:14:31	Go get 'em Holly, we're all with you. 
Espngreeny	724625768723156992	2016-04-25T15:47:00	I've never rooted for Tom Brady in a single game in his career. But this is just flat wrong and has been from the very start.
Espngreeny	724625554704576512	2016-04-25T15:46:09	The punishment for Tom Brady was driven by owners of other teams who now get what they deserve: this idiocy overshadowing their draft.
Espngreeny	724625214324269056	2016-04-25T15:44:48	This was an equipment violation, at worst, and should have been treated as such. Brady
Espngreeny	724625043129532416	2016-04-25T15:44:07	A four game suspension for Tom Brady was ridiculous when first announced and remains ridiculous today.

Espngreeny	724609195962707968	2016-04-25T14:41:09	Really enjoyed spending the morning with this guy today. Funny, insightful and very, very smart. 
Espngreeny	724597076445802496	2016-04-25T13:53:00	Who wore the glasses better? ESPNGreeny or TheJohnSalley?  RT for Greeny LIKE for Salley 
Espngreeny	724561001740292097	2016-04-25T11:29:39	Greeny or D-Wade. Who wore it better?  
Espngreeny	724538253483888640	2016-04-25T09:59:15	If Steph Curry can't come back, what is the ceiling for the Warriors?
Espngreeny	724363426668109824	2016-04-24T22:24:33	The Rockets had an interesting way of backing up their CEO today. They didn't hustle, and they didn't even bother to fake it.
Espngreeny	724362479346810880	2016-04-24T22:20:47	The juxtaposition in the passion of Dave Joerger vs the Rockets in defeat today was striking. And, telling.
Espngreeny	724361823475109888	2016-04-24T22:18:11	Warriors scored 65 points in the second half without Steph on the floor and the Rockets look like they couldn't possibly care less.
Espngreeny	724358891396583424	2016-04-24T22:06:32	In spite of myself, I find The Settlers very funny.
Espngreeny	723877332566548480	2016-04-23T14:12:59	This is the video from the National Association of Broadcasters event. Thanks for sixteen unbelievable years.

Espngreeny	723622066763739136	2016-04-22T21:18:39	Steph Curry. In my view, still underrated.

Espngreeny	723255457683521537	2016-04-21T21:01:53	This could get ugly for the Philadelphia Eagles.

Espngreeny	722914192865398786	2016-04-20T22:25:49	Minnesota was by far the best coaching job that will change hands this NBA off season. Not surprised Thibs got it. He's a difference maker.
Espngreeny	722913833086554112	2016-04-20T22:24:23	Happy for Coach Thibs. Did a GREAT job in Chicago. Never had the horses, at least not healthy. He's got a real shot now. Twolves

Espngreeny	722807078029361156	2016-04-20T15:20:11	Wow. Kurkjian_ESPN just said on SportsCenter he thinks Bryce Harper will wind up one of the five greatest hitters of all time.

Espngreeny	719303721084186624	2016-04-10T23:19:05	So many people would have declined to talk after not getting it done, not Jordan. Feel his hurt, but a true professional!
Espngreeny	719297822462492672	2016-04-10T22:55:39	If it's any consolation to Jordan, and I'm sure it isn't, all the greats—Jones, Hogan, Nelson, Snead, Palmer, Nicklaus—have given them away.
Espngreeny	719301701669429248	2016-04-10T23:11:04	That was tough to watch.
Espngreeny	719300033779265536	2016-04-10T23:04:26	Danny Willett played great. But this will unfortunately always be the Masters that Jordan Spieth lost.
Espngreeny	719299249251487744	2016-04-10T23:01:19	There will be a lot more great days for Jordan Spieth, he'll win this thing again. But this one doesn't go away for a while. Masters

Espngreeny	719286770295246848	2016-04-10T22:11:44	Oh, what a shot that is. Willett Masters
Espngreeny	719284940949626881	2016-04-10T22:04:28	He still doesn't miss putts. Not out of it yet. Spieth Masters
Espngreeny	719282543175024640	2016-04-10T21:54:56	Just about everyone I know has texted me in the last ten minutes asking the same question. No, I cannot believe that just happened. Masters
Espngreeny	719279817527541760	2016-04-10T21:44:06	I don't believe what I'm seeing. Masters

Espngreeny	719270875632111616	2016-04-10T21:08:34	I know you know this, but Jordan Spieth is 22 years old. How many times might he win this tournament? Masters
Espngreeny	719260158048759808	2016-04-10T20:25:59	Yes, but Tiger could overpower a golf course too. Spieth can't. But, you're right, when he needed them they went in. 
Espngreeny	719259681735241728	2016-04-10T20:24:05	Jordan Spieth is getting very close to turning out the lights. Masters
Espngreeny	719257280814956544	2016-04-10T20:14:33	I've been watching golf twenty years. I'm not sure I've ever seen anybody putt when it matters like this guy. Spieth Masters
Espngreeny	719250512835670018	2016-04-10T19:47:39	That's the kind of par save by Jordan Spieth that wins a green jacket.
Espngreeny	719250505894076416	2016-04-10T19:47:38	What a par. Spieth Masters
Espngreeny	719248433199071233	2016-04-10T19:39:24	Watching Jack Nicklaus win the '86 Masters, overriding thought is that Bernhard Langer has had the same haircut for thirty years.
Espngreeny	719247815420076032	2016-04-10T19:36:56	Would be surprised if Jordan Spieth falls back. Someone is going to have to go get him. Any of these guys have it in them? Masters

Espngreeny	718945086399246341	2016-04-09T23:34:00	And so, stunningly, Spieth brings everyone back in. Tomorrow should be great. Masters
Espngreeny	718939050984501249	2016-04-09T23:10:01	That is absolutely correct!!! Jets 
Espngreeny	718938906402676739	2016-04-09T23:09:27	Oh, I love it!!! Jets 
Espngreeny	718921168955301888	2016-04-09T21:58:58	Very interesting... 
Espngreeny	718919554307616769	2016-04-09T21:52:33	What a day for Bernhard Langer. Masters
Espngreeny	718916148390141953	2016-04-09T21:39:01	Rory at that point in the round when I usually stop keeping score and double my alcohol intake.
Espngreeny	718916685571428352	2016-04-09T21:41:09	Whoa. Didn't see that coming. Spieth Masters
Espngreeny	718916341885988864	2016-04-09T21:39:47	Beginning with the three putt on seven, Rory McIlroy has probably just played himself out of the tournament in five holes. Masters
Espngreeny	718911990744408064	2016-04-09T21:22:29	Bernhard Langer won this thing twice before Spieth was born. He's three back of Jordan, alone in second right now. Masters
Espngreeny	718911177108099072	2016-04-09T21:19:16	Wheels = Off. Rory Masters
Espngreeny	718910460901388288	2016-04-09T21:16:25	Spieth has steadied himself and is now in that cruise control mode he alone seems to have. Masters
Espngreeny	718903860467744768	2016-04-09T20:50:11	That's a ridiculous birdie by Jason Day. He is right in the thick of this now. Masters
Espngreeny	718898647052775428	2016-04-09T20:29:28	That is a brutal pin on seven. Masters
Espngreeny	718898075188731904	2016-04-09T20:27:12	And that's not a gimme. Masters

Espngreeny	718895587253469186	2016-04-09T20:17:19	Jordan Spieth has bailed himself out making putts but if he keeps spraying it like this I can't imagine he'll hang on to the lead. Masters
Espngreeny	718886293883723776	2016-04-09T19:40:23	Jason Day is very much in it. Masters
Espngreeny	718884533874094080	2016-04-09T19:33:23	That's a really good point: Spieth and Rory have to combat feeling they are in match play. Masters
Espngreeny	718799150201114625	2016-04-09T13:54:06	Of course not. But he's right a heck of a lot more often than the average fan is.  
Espngreeny	718786241865625601	2016-04-09T13:02:49	Rory and Spieth in the final pairing this afternoon. You could probably ask for more than that out of life but I'm not sure what. Masters
Espngreeny	718785443781832704	2016-04-09T12:59:38	I find it fascinating that everyone thinks they know better than the manager what the best thing is for his player and his team. Dodgers

Espngreeny	718534772381847552	2016-04-08T20:23:34	Right now Jordan Spieth looks the least comfortable we've ever seen him at Augusta. They're rushing him and he doesn't like it. Masters
Espngreeny	718531370176421888	2016-04-08T20:10:02	Mickelson just three putted from four feet. Back to back sixes. Masters

Espngreeny	718520361491501056	2016-04-08T19:26:18	Rory McIlory just planted one from 243 yards straight into the fan. I have no idea what life would be like if you could do that. Masters

Espngreeny	716635429059989504	2016-04-03T14:36:15	Hate to see a great season end the way it did for Oklahoma and Buddy Hield. Sometimes those nights just come at the worst possible time.
Espngreeny	716635065191542785	2016-04-03T14:34:48	Not enough attention I've seen this morning paid to the foul shooting. Syracuse went a long way toward giving that game away from the line.
Espngreeny	716634786115112966	2016-04-03T14:33:42	Brice Johnson got his second foul midway through the half in a tie game. Carolina went to halftime up 11. Depth up front the difference.
Espngreeny	716634017735450625	2016-04-03T14:30:38	If Villanova shoots like that again they beat anybody. But Carolina's size and depth are a big edge. I like UNC in, hopefully, a tight game.
Espngreeny	716633416041508864	2016-04-03T14:28:15	Carolina was just too good in the paint last night, strength against strength. Nova doesn't have answers for the UNC bigs either.

Espngreeny	716630298574725120	2016-04-03T14:15:52	The Mets may have the best starting pitching in baseball. And, in total, it will cost them under $7M this year.
Espngreeny	716403526579126272	2016-04-02T23:14:45	You couldn't be more right. The game is a rumor.  
Espngreeny	716402821063643137	2016-04-02T23:11:57	And only ten per cent of those people can actually see the game! The rest are just listening.

Espngreeny	716284681432535040	2016-04-02T15:22:30	If you were starting a basketball team, how many coaches would you hire ahead of Brad Stevens? Factoring in age, answer might be: None.
Espngreeny	716283708240699392	2016-04-02T15:18:38	Say it again, in victory and defeat the Warriors have made a lot of nights feel like the playoffs. Record or no, what a year they've had.

Espngreeny	691352471223017472	2016-01-24T20:10:48	Pressure in the face. Physical in the secondary. That's the ticket. Broncos
Espngreeny	691297188417241089	2016-01-24T16:31:08	I like Panthers to make the Super Bowl with a 36-20 victory over Cardinals. Give the points. KOD
Espngreeny	691297004320858112	2016-01-24T16:30:24	I see too many ways Panthers win this game. If they force a few turnovers, could be one sided.
Espngreeny	691296099571781634	2016-01-24T16:26:48	Cam Newton showed no sign of nerves last week. Second half was an aberration. Playing with that big a lead is tricky. Panthers
Espngreeny	691295636822626304	2016-01-24T16:24:58	Carolina defense, despite questionable secondary, is much better than Green Bay.
Espngreeny	691295414084071424	2016-01-24T16:24:05	Carson Palmer looked tight. Should've been picked four times. One touchdown was lucky. Brilliance of Larry Fitzgerald bailed him out.
Espngreeny	691293489796087809	2016-01-24T16:16:26	I didn't like what I saw from Cardinals offense last week at all.
Espngreeny	691292068979838976	2016-01-24T16:10:47	I see Patriots in a disappointingly easy game, 28-17 and not as close as that sounds. Give the points. KOD
Espngreeny	691291681929433089	2016-01-24T16:09:15	Only pause I have is the line. Begging you to give the points. Feels like a trap. But I'm falling into it. NEvsDEN
Espngreeny	691291344736772097	2016-01-24T16:07:54	But with Gronk and Edelman healthy, Pats have been close to unbeatable. And I think their defense can force two turnovers against Peyton.
Espngreeny	691291076108353545	2016-01-24T16:06:50	If Von Miller and company find some way to disrupt Brady quickly enough, if Demaryius Thomas makes a few huge plays. Broncos

Espngreeny	690225218506375168	2016-01-21T17:31:30	Here is today's Best of Mike and Mike podcast.  
Espngreeny	690219187617296385	2016-01-21T17:07:32	The trash talk and all that has nothing to do with it. Talking doesn't slow down Gronk and Edelman. And neither will the Broncos.
Espngreeny	690218043742511104	2016-01-21T17:02:59	It's a shame this is where Peyton is at this stage but it is what it is. Two years ago this was a fair fight. It isn't now.
Espngreeny	690217876763066369	2016-01-21T17:02:20	With his weapons healthy, Tom Brady has basically been unstoppable. You'll have to outscore him. Can't see Peyton being able to do it.
Espngreeny	690217594184437762	2016-01-21T17:01:12	Intrigued and surprised that ESPN's analytics team favors Broncos over Patriots Sunday. Don't see it at all.

Espngreeny	689491516721528832	2016-01-19T16:56:02	Endless thanks to the listener who sent me this. I love it. Tiny 
Espngreeny	688967566375661568	2016-01-18T06:14:02	Secret files expose evidence of suspected match fixing at the top level of world tennis  
Espngreeny	688859930632257536	2016-01-17T23:06:20	I'm a little surprised Peyton did.  
Espngreeny	688859554109607936	2016-01-17T23:04:50	That hit reminiscent of Joe Montana against the Giants in the NFC Championship game. PITvsDEN
Espngreeny	688858940478717952	2016-01-17T23:02:24	Boy, that's a big hit... PITvsDEN
Espngreeny	688855557931929600	2016-01-17T22:48:57	Fumble?
Espngreeny	688852801913536512	2016-01-17T22:38:00	Really nice comments from Jim and Phil for mortreport.
Espngreeny	688851902197592064	2016-01-17T22:34:26	Great throw. Ben looks great. Receivers not always helping him out. Steelers
Espngreeny	688847412526497792	2016-01-17T22:16:35	Terrific drive. Creative playcalling. Ben looks fine. Steelers in great shape.
Espngreeny	688845222772649985	2016-01-17T22:07:53	Massive moral victory. Steelers.
Espngreeny	688843123007602689	2016-01-17T21:59:33	Too cute. Not fooled. PITvsDEN
Espngreeny	688842285090471936	2016-01-17T21:56:13	I love the playcall. Should've been a touchdown. Steelers
Espngreeny	688838693315067904	2016-01-17T21:41:57	That was there... Steelers
Espngreeny	688832476442177536	2016-01-17T21:17:14	Goes without saying Seahawks dug too deep a hole. Left some points on the field that could've made a difference too. SEAvsCAR
Espngreeny	688831553334591489	2016-01-17T21:13:34	Great kick. Even better play by Davis. SEAvsCAR
Espngreeny	688824733270470656	2016-01-17T20:46:28	You're kidding... SEAvsCAR
Espngreeny	688823062360383488	2016-01-17T20:39:50	Catch. SEAvsCAR
Espngreeny	688821042127699968	2016-01-17T20:31:48	What a hit by Kam Chancellor. SeahawksvsPanthers
Espngreeny	688813825018179584	2016-01-17T20:03:08	Ohhhh!!!! Seahawks
Espngreeny	688812937964843008	2016-01-17T19:59:36	Can't miss that chance!!! Seahawks
Espngreeny	688812846226997249	2016-01-17T19:59:14	Had it!!! Seahawks
Espngreeny	688812029260464128	2016-01-17T19:55:59	Wonderful moment there regarding Tony Corrente and mortreport. Thanks to Joe, Troy, Mike and everyone at Fox.
Espngreeny	688809930892115972	2016-01-17T19:47:39	Okay.... SEAvsCAR
Espngreeny	688805907585695744	2016-01-17T19:31:40	I was really looking forward to this game.
Espngreeny	688805041235431426	2016-01-17T19:28:13	Did Andy Reid call those two plays? Seahawks
Espngreeny	688803022789541889	2016-01-17T19:20:12	Kiss of death. 
Espngreeny	688801752083070976	2016-01-17T19:15:09	ICYMI: I sat down with markschlereth and we talked about the Broncos offensive line ahead of today's game.  
Espngreeny	688800014223732736	2016-01-17T19:08:15	I'll give you one guess. KOD 
Espngreeny	688799919197564929	2016-01-17T19:07:52	Maybe I'm the secret to their success! 
Espngreeny	688799446486896645	2016-01-17T19:05:59	This is a thoroughly stunning and brilliant performance. If there was any question about Carolina, there isn't anymore. SEAvsCAR
Espngreeny	688770714053267457	2016-01-17T17:11:49	This is great fun to watch if you have a couple minutes.  
Espngreeny	688768017845633024	2016-01-17T17:01:06	Just found this. So classy, everything he says... 
Espngreeny	688766695385747456	2016-01-17T16:55:51	KOD picks were 1-1 yesterday, now 2-4 in the postseason. Early game today, I'm taking the points with the... 
Espngreeny	688753412461072385	2016-01-17T16:03:04	This guy coached a hell of a game last night. His team was outplayed and found a way to win. And… 
Espngreeny	688750402091790336	2016-01-17T15:51:06	On the 4th quarter drive that pulled them within a score the Chiefs had 8 instances where at least 25 seconds ran off between plays. Eight!
Espngreeny	688749737793712128	2016-01-17T15:48:28	In his last four playoff games Julian Edelman has 36 catches, threw a touchdown and caught the winning score in the Super Bowl. Patriots
Espngreeny	688747331743780866	2016-01-17T15:38:54	Don't want to hear about changing OT rule. Larry Fitzgerald ran 61 yards after the catch. Hold them to a FG and you get the ball. GBvsAZ
Espngreeny	688746091098038272	2016-01-17T15:33:59	I love the aggressiveness of Bruce Arians. He coached that game to win last night, on both sides of the ball. Cardinals
Espngreeny	688745075896127488	2016-01-17T15:29:57	Carson Palmer played, by reasonable assessment, terribly. And wound up w 349 yards 3 TDs and his first ever playoff win. CraziestGameEver
Espngreeny	688740959211892737	2016-01-17T15:13:35	Jeff Janis had 79 yards receiving all season. He had 101 on the last drive. CraziestGameEver
Espngreeny	688739950741876736	2016-01-17T15:09:35	The coin didn't flip. CraziestGameEver
Espngreeny	688738962958061570	2016-01-17T15:05:39	On his final drive of the season Aaron Rodgers was sacked once and completed 2 of 6 passes for 101 yards. Packers CraziestGameEver
Espngreeny	688737540606660608	2016-01-17T15:00:00	Raise your hand if you knew Packers had a receiver named Jeff Janis before kick. He had 7 catches 145 yards 2 scores. CraziestGameEver
Espngreeny	688584327047835648	2016-01-17T04:51:11	KOD pick had that one exactly right, Cardinals win but don't cover. 1-1 on the day.
Espngreeny	688583971677011968	2016-01-17T04:49:46	That's a bitter loss for Packers. Dramatic finish aside, they had a lot of chances to win.
Espngreeny	688583069327081472	2016-01-17T04:46:11	I was rooting for Green Bay but I'm delighted for Larry Fitzgerald. That guy is a pro's pro. Cardinals
Espngreeny	688581995883040768	2016-01-17T04:41:55	Aaron Rodgers completed two Hail Marys to a player who only had two catches all year. And lost. GBvsAZ
Espngreeny	688581110889074689	2016-01-17T04:38:24	Epic. GBvsAZ
Espngreeny	688579654979076096	2016-01-17T04:32:37	It didn't flip. That's a new one.
Espngreeny	688579031340576768	2016-01-17T04:30:08	That is among the most incredible things I can ever remember seeing in sports.
Espngreeny	688578558340546561	2016-01-17T04:28:16	That may be the greatest throw I have ever seen. Aaron Packers
Espngreeny	688578133793050624	2016-01-17T04:26:34	Oh!!!!!!!!!
Espngreeny	688576415479001089	2016-01-17T04:19:45	Come on!! That's blatant!!!!
Espngreeny	688574639954595848	2016-01-17T04:12:41	I like the playcall. Field goal doesn't end the game.
Espngreeny	688574118241894400	2016-01-17T04:10:37	Packers are going to be sick when they lose this game. Dropped int's, wasted timeouts, impossible bounces. Should've won this game.
Espngreeny	688573364412231681	2016-01-17T04:07:37	Wasted timeouts. Packers
Espngreeny	688571632051449858	2016-01-17T04:00:44	You've got to be kidding me...
Espngreeny	688570845556506624	2016-01-17T03:57:37	Have to intercept that!!!! Packers
Espngreeny	688566458272608257	2016-01-17T03:40:11	Oh, that's a huge play. And a terrible throw. GBvsAZ
Espngreeny	688564019779776512	2016-01-17T03:30:29	Did he catch that?
Espngreeny	688559956635824128	2016-01-17T03:14:21	That's a really stupid penalty. Packers
Espngreeny	688557133072326658	2016-01-17T03:03:07	Feeling better. Phoebe 
Espngreeny	688557417584525312	2016-01-17T03:04:15	That was a very amusing run to watch. Packers
Espngreeny	688547462093639680	2016-01-17T02:24:42	Shorthanded Packers dominating time of possession.
Espngreeny	688539125742448640	2016-01-17T01:51:34	What a catch!!!
Espngreeny	688538599437000704	2016-01-17T01:49:29	Catch the damn ball! Packers
Espngreeny	688536305840590848	2016-01-17T01:40:22	Packers playing the first quarter a lot faster than the Chiefs did the fourth.
Espngreeny	688534475798609920	2016-01-17T01:33:06	What a gorgeous throw. Cardinals
Espngreeny	688532273776431104	2016-01-17T01:24:21	Drop an interception, two penalties, lousy punt. Packers putting on a clinic on what a road underdog cannot do.
Espngreeny	688526902169092097	2016-01-17T01:03:00	KOD picks now 1-4. I've got Green Bay getting points tonight. Thus, bet your house on the Cardinals.
Espngreeny	688526209106448384	2016-01-17T01:00:15	AZ and GB about to hit the field. Check out the new highlight reels for Carson Palmer and JordyRNelson:  partner
Espngreeny	688525041718444033	2016-01-17T00:55:36	Tom Brady is headed to his 10th conference championship game. Only four other TEAMS have been in that many. Patriots
Espngreeny	688524421716422656	2016-01-17T00:53:08	If there was question going into this season there isn't anymore, at least for me. Tom Brady is the best quarterback of all time. Patriots
Espngreeny	688523838724960256	2016-01-17T00:50:49	That play may have been lucky. But the win isn't. Tom Brady was almost perfect and the Chiefs made the exact mistakes you can't afford to.
Espngreeny	688521590003384320	2016-01-17T00:41:53	They're huddling!!!
Espngreeny	688521058106871809	2016-01-17T00:39:47	Chiefs ran one play in 50 seconds.
Espngreeny	688520749334814720	2016-01-17T00:38:33	That is embarrassingly bad clock management. Chiefs
Espngreeny	688516690863386626	2016-01-17T00:22:25	Better off not intercepting that. But, whatever. KCvsNE
Espngreeny	688515632678203392	2016-01-17T00:18:13	Pretty close to being a fumble?
Espngreeny	688514315905806336	2016-01-17T00:12:59	I'll take the under. 
Espngreeny	688512361217560578	2016-01-17T00:05:13	This game was over the instant the ball fell out of Knile Davis' hands. KCvsNE
Espngreeny	688510436367593473	2016-01-16T23:57:34	Repeat after me: If you're going to beat New England, you can't drop that ball. KCvsNE
Espngreeny	688510100714196993	2016-01-16T23:56:14	See what I mean?! 
Espngreeny	688509901606400000	2016-01-16T23:55:27	No quarterback has ever played at this level at 38. Or, frankly, any other age either. Brady KCvsNE
Espngreeny	688507893742727168	2016-01-16T23:47:28	I've seen this game a thousand times. The Patriots never lose it. KCvsNE
Espngreeny	688506526521249792	2016-01-16T23:42:02	Matt Patricia looks like our raymanjr who is appropriately nicknamed Patriot Ray.
Espngreeny	688504318920650752	2016-01-16T23:33:16	Let me know when the next game starts. KCvsNE
Espngreeny	688503889604272129	2016-01-16T23:31:33	Might as well find something else to do for a while. KCvsNE
Espngreeny	688502901329801216	2016-01-16T23:27:38	Chiefs doing all the things you can't do against New England. I've seen this game a million times. KCvsNE
Espngreeny	688498112369942528	2016-01-16T23:08:36	So, they're due?  
Espngreeny	688496956222627841	2016-01-16T23:04:00	If you're going to put a bunch of threes on the board against Patriots you have no chance.
Espngreeny	688496560657842176	2016-01-16T23:02:26	What an awful sequence that was. Chiefs
Espngreeny	688495344926220288	2016-01-16T22:57:36	That was huge third down completion for Alex Smith. Should mean points and keep it away from Brady until into the third quarter. KCvsNE
Espngreeny	688492361391976448	2016-01-16T22:45:45	I saw this against the Jets in October. Tom Brady won a game basically all by himself. Doing it again today. KCvsNE
Espngreeny	688491227814178816	2016-01-16T22:41:14	That's a touchdown. KCvsNE
Espngreeny	688484302909272064	2016-01-16T22:13:43	A defensive stop feels like a monumental victory. KCvsNE
Espngreeny	688483914399219713	2016-01-16T22:12:11	Pick that!!!!! KCvsNE
Espngreeny	688483639642951680	2016-01-16T22:11:05	Third downs. KCvsNE
Espngreeny	688482015121903616	2016-01-16T22:04:38	Terrific drive. The dimension Alex Smith adds with his ability to run is underrated. KCvsNE
Espngreeny	688479983229120512	2016-01-16T21:56:33	Twinning. KCvsNE 
Espngreeny	688477462926340096	2016-01-16T21:46:33	Patriots did exactly this in first game vs Jets. Never bothered to try running the ball. Put it all on Brady. And won. KCvsNE
Espngreeny	688476686376153088	2016-01-16T21:43:27	That was awfully impressive. Patriots Brady
Espngreeny	688476106010324995	2016-01-16T21:41:09	Picking them apart. Brady
Espngreeny	688475347436855296	2016-01-16T21:38:08	Typical Edelman. KCvsNE
Espngreeny	688468403904999424	2016-01-16T21:10:33	My NFL KOD picks today: I can't imagine New England Patriots overcoming all their injuries. Can't imagine... 
Espngreeny	688391936533762048	2016-01-16T16:06:42	This is very nicely done. Worth your time if you have a few minutes. 
Espngreeny	688387067278041090	2016-01-16T15:47:21	I ask you: Is anything better than driving on a nice, sunny day and this song comes on the radio? 
Espngreeny	688376345449992192	2016-01-16T15:04:44	When everyone is on one side, best to bet other way. The world has discarded Packers. Not me. Take the points. They'll keep it close. KOD
Espngreeny	688375927428919296	2016-01-16T15:03:05	Patriots are banged up. Chiefs are better than anyone gives them credit for. I've got Kansas City for the win. Take the points. KOD

Espngreeny	688012982568222721	2016-01-15T15:00:52	I hate that Antonio Brown can't play this game. Steelers
Espngreeny	688007315879006208	2016-01-15T14:38:21	Bummed AntonioBrown84 won't be playing Sunday.  Glad his health and safety are coming first.

Espngreeny	686943429234802690	2016-01-12T16:10:50	In my opinion, Nick Saban is the most accomplished college football coach of all time. And he probably isn't close to being done. Alabama

Espngreeny	686746999039762432	2016-01-12T03:10:18	The clock obviously should not have started. That should be reviewable. Clemson screwed out of at least one play. BAMAvsCLEM
Espngreeny	686746540648611840	2016-01-12T03:08:29	Terrific half. Clemson defense athletic enough to hang. Alabama needs to run it. Watson the X Factor. Tons of energy in the building.
Espngreeny	686732942501134337	2016-01-12T02:14:27	Watson looks tremendous. The Clemson section is insane. BAMAvsCLEM

Espngreeny	686348598288621568	2016-01-11T00:47:12	KOD picks 1-3 against the spread. Nice to know there are still some things you can count on.
Espngreeny	686348358487650304	2016-01-11T00:46:15	All four road teams favored. All four win.

Espngreeny	686336871882858496	2016-01-11T00:00:36	This one has all the makings. GBvsWAS
Espngreeny	686332765311127553	2016-01-10T23:44:17	Great imagination on that drive. Terrific coaching. GBvsWAS
Espngreeny	686332338624573441	2016-01-10T23:42:35	Love the onions on the playcall. And the composure of the quarterback. GBvsWAS
Espngreeny	686317525974388736	2016-01-10T22:43:44	So, I guess he's still Aaron Rodgers. Packers
Espngreeny	686314499272347648	2016-01-10T22:31:42	You like that! Cousins
Espngreeny	686305430750900224	2016-01-10T21:55:40	Packers offensive line. Safety
Espngreeny	686293944603283456	2016-01-10T21:10:01	I feel sick for Mike Zimmer. He coached a great game. Did just about everything right. What a way to lose. Vikings
Espngreeny	686292071674589185	2016-01-10T21:02:35	There is no way that just happened.
Espngreeny	686291986957991937	2016-01-10T21:02:15	No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Espngreeny	686290462957678592	2016-01-10T20:56:11	Big time throw. Vikings
Espngreeny	686288330451894272	2016-01-10T20:47:43	Feel like Vikings have outplayed them. But the really big plays in the game have all gone one way.
Espngreeny	686287256340926464	2016-01-10T20:43:27	That dropped pick cost the Vikings forty yards.
Espngreeny	686281112964837376	2016-01-10T20:19:02	Russell Wilson. My goodness. Seahawks
Espngreeny	686278499196248064	2016-01-10T20:08:39	Two score lead in this weather? Vikings
Espngreeny	686276469199208449	2016-01-10T20:00:35	Great analysis by Collinsworth. Wilson wants to run backwards. Vikings won't let him.
Espngreeny	686273649695850496	2016-01-10T19:49:23	That call.... SEAvsMIN
Espngreeny	686271243377446912	2016-01-10T19:39:49	What a catch. Seahawks
Espngreeny	686267405954240512	2016-01-10T19:24:34	About as scintillating as a 3-0 half can possibly be. SEAvsMIN
Espngreeny	686265771660546048	2016-01-10T19:18:04	MRI showed Chiefs WR Jeremy Maclin did NOT tear his ACL, per source. He did suffer a high ankle sprain. Status for Saturday at NE uncertain.
Espngreeny	686262898952241153	2016-01-10T19:06:39	That play made absolutely no sense. If you can't kick it, throw the ball past the sticks. No matter what. Seahawks
Espngreeny	686249592262799360	2016-01-10T18:13:47	I was sure that was a hard count. Gutsy call. Love it. Vikings
Espngreeny	686247302340587520	2016-01-10T18:04:41	Bud Grant is the man. Vikings
Espngreeny	686245784476516352	2016-01-10T17:58:39	It's -6 at the stadium with a -25 wind chill. It's officially the coldest game in Vikings history, 3rd coldest in NFL history.

Espngreeny	686223735687352322	2016-01-10T16:31:02	Set to land in the Valley Of The Sun. Thanks, all, for the give and take. Enjoy the football today. And stay warm, Minnesota.
Espngreeny	686223555089006596	2016-01-10T16:30:19	If the Bengals fire Marvin Lewis, that immediately becomes BY FAR the most attractive opening.
Espngreeny	686215203042816001	2016-01-10T15:57:08	Oh please. Everyone is talking about it.  
Espngreeny	686214748845780992	2016-01-10T15:55:20	I appreciate the give and take. Long flight, wifi, and too much coffee. I'm just getting warmed up.  
Espngreeny	686213014643732481	2016-01-10T15:48:26	Chet_Ripley Oh, and I love your avi.
Espngreeny	686212917251960834	2016-01-10T15:48:03	Chet_Ripley I was asleep, watched it on the dvr this morning. Without knowing what happened. Was rather thrilling, actually.
Espngreeny	686212512765874182	2016-01-10T15:46:26	Bengals were a laughingstock before Marvin Lewis. He has them in the playoffs every year in a tough division. Fire him at your own risk.
Espngreeny	686211708394713089	2016-01-10T15:43:15	Make sure to layer up! ForgeAhead 
Espngreeny	686211970085863425	2016-01-10T15:44:17	Folks are feisty this morning. I like it.
Espngreeny	686210908033560576	2016-01-10T15:40:04	You do realize that to lose in the first round five straight years you have to first make the playoffs five straight years, right?
Espngreeny	686207666142769152	2016-01-10T15:27:11	I agree. And no one to blame but themselves that they didn't get the chance.  
Espngreeny	686206812127936512	2016-01-10T15:23:47	Makes sense. They need a quarterback whisperer. 
Espngreeny	686206430953779200	2016-01-10T15:22:16	No.  
Espngreeny	686205612158521344	2016-01-10T15:19:01	The guy he "shouldn't have had in the game" made the play that should've iced it on the previous series.  
Espngreeny	686204700660772864	2016-01-10T15:15:24	Really? Why?  
Espngreeny	686204337463398402	2016-01-10T15:13:57	For the players involved, I agree. But who turned that game off? Did you?  
Espngreeny	686203994121867265	2016-01-10T15:12:35	With Dalton they would've had a bye this weekend.  
Espngreeny	686202654926700544	2016-01-10T15:07:16	At some point you have to believe what your eyes are seeing. The Packers just aren't that good. Washington wins at home. YouLikeThat KOD
Espngreeny	686201963533447172	2016-01-10T15:04:31	The lack of Lynch is a surprising setback. Still like Seahawks today, but something seems wrong. Wear a warm coat and give the points. KOD
Espngreeny	686201054678106112	2016-01-10T15:00:55	KOD picks were 1-1 vs the spread. Chiefs Steelers
Espngreeny	686200727920840704	2016-01-10T14:59:37	I can't see any way Steelers beat Denver if Antonio Brown can't play.
Espngreeny	686200409749360640	2016-01-10T14:58:21	AmyTrask Okay, good. I hope at least some are caught.
Espngreeny	686200103594491904	2016-01-10T14:57:08	The fans throwing stuff was the worst part of the night. The rest was the raw, rugged, violent drama that makes the sport what it is.
Espngreeny	686199943439212544	2016-01-10T14:56:30	The narrative that this game was an embarrassment for the league is silly to me. It was football, in all its violent glory.
Espngreeny	686199554321068032	2016-01-10T14:54:57	How do they identify them? Are there cameras aimed in the stands that we don't see?  
Espngreeny	686198976715030528	2016-01-10T14:52:39	On a tough night in many different ways I thought AJ McCarron acquitted himself pretty well. He could start on a half dozen teams right now.
Espngreeny	686198271811940352	2016-01-10T14:49:51	I wouldn't fire Marvin Lewis. He had the game won with a backup QB. The fumble cost them the game and the season.
Espngreeny	686198190945767424	2016-01-10T14:49:32	Don't blame Marvin Lewis for actions of two hot headed defenders. You live and die with your best players. If Hill doesn't fumble, they win.
Espngreeny	686197653756076033	2016-01-10T14:47:24	I thought, all things considered, the officials did a reasonable job trying to maintain order.
Espngreeny	686197333797801984	2016-01-10T14:46:07	Mike Munchak should be heavily fined. More than any player in this game, including Burfict.
Espngreeny	686196523550568448	2016-01-10T14:42:54	If they are able to identify regulars who threw bottles and debris onto the field, they should take their tickets away permanently.
Espngreeny	686196385847373825	2016-01-10T14:42:21	If you threw a bottle, or anything, at Ben Roethlisberger being carted off the field you should be ashamed of yourself. Disgraceful.
Espngreeny	686195916622180353	2016-01-10T14:40:30	The catch Martavis Bryant made in the corner of the end zone was the best of this season and second only to OBJ in recent memory. Steelers
Espngreeny	686195852398964738	2016-01-10T14:40:14	Just finished with last night's game in Cincinnati, one that will be talked about for a long time. Forgive the flurry of thoughts to follow.
Espngreeny	686140873864802308	2016-01-10T11:01:46	The American flight from Kennedy to Phoenix is overrun, I mean overrun, with Clemson fans. I think I'm the only one not wearing orange.
Espngreeny	686129681314230272	2016-01-10T10:17:18	I can't stop watching this... 
Espngreeny	685984869088931840	2016-01-10T00:41:52	The storyline today is going to be how bad Texans were. And they were. But Chiefs are for real too. Most complete team in the AFC.
Espngreeny	685983667907379201	2016-01-10T00:37:06	The Texans could have drafted Blake Bortles. Instead, they're the only team in the AFC South without a young stud quarterback.
Espngreeny	685938485291778048	2016-01-09T21:37:33	What a start... Chiefs
Espngreeny	685866288049176576	2016-01-09T16:50:40	Top priority in Miami is to develop Ryan Tannehill. Hiring Adam Gase makes sense. Did great job with Jay Cutler. Dolphins
Espngreeny	685854373256249344	2016-01-09T16:03:19	KOD pick: Steelers on the road, giving points. Last two weeks have me nervous, but rolling with Ben in a high scoring second half.
Espngreeny	685853814285582337	2016-01-09T16:01:06	KOD pick: Chiefs on the road, giving points. Better QB, better balance, better team. A real threat next weekend too, wherever they are.
Espngreeny	685810195264618496	2016-01-09T13:07:46	This could be fun. Espngreeny 
Espngreeny	685810826570240000	2016-01-09T13:10:17	I definitely miss it. The city, at least Manhattan, had a lot more personality back then.  
Espngreeny	685802410552487936	2016-01-09T12:36:50	This is exactly where I grew up, a place that doesn't exist anymore. What a fabulous piece. 
Espngreeny	685580321069363200	2016-01-08T21:54:20	Packers have fallen and they won't get up. Kirk Cousins has been near perfect at home and it's for real. Getting a point? Lock. KOD
Espngreeny	685579316554498049	2016-01-08T21:50:21	Challenging conditions good for Vikings because they can't hang with Seahawks. And they won't, despite the cold. Take Seattle, big. KOD
Espngreeny	685578631486259201	2016-01-08T21:47:37	I've been on the Steelers since August. Won't bail now, though past two weeks have me nervous. I'll take Ben in a tight one, 30-27. KOD
Espngreeny	685578160344272896	2016-01-08T21:45:45	Alex Smith is a better quarterback than he gets credit for, especially in January. Chiefs are hot and stay that way. Give the points. KOD

Espngreeny	684787227415724032	2016-01-06T17:22:52	Ken Griffey Jr was as good a player as I ever saw. Gets my vote for best player of his generation. HOF
Espngreeny	684787009647411200	2016-01-06T17:22:00	I believe Curt Schilling belongs in the Hall Of Fame. As good in big games as anyone of his generation.
Espngreeny	684786724451516416	2016-01-06T17:20:52	Mike Piazza should have been in the Hall Of Fame years ago.

Espngreeny	684424170508267520	2016-01-05T17:20:12	I still can't believe the Jets lost.
Espngreeny	684423749622444033	2016-01-05T17:18:32	I think RGIII to the Cowboys makes a lot of sense for both sides.
Espngreeny	684423410450063361	2016-01-05T17:17:11	I loved Tom Coughlin's press conference. He is an earnest man in a profession overrun with phonies. Giants
Espngreeny	684423085873852416	2016-01-05T17:15:54	If anyone should be thinking way outside the box and trying to reinvent football, it probably isn't the Browns.
Espngreeny	684413238352736256	2016-01-05T16:36:46	This is worth the investment of time... 
Espngreeny	684177432870563840	2016-01-05T00:59:46	Tom Coughlin. Great coach. Better person. This picture is worth far more than a thousand words. (SageRosenfels18)

Espngreeny	684130042822168576	2016-01-04T21:51:27	No matter how bad your team, at least you're not the Browns.

Espngreeny	683757124044849153	2016-01-03T21:09:36	Rex Ryan had his team a lot more ready to play a football game today than Todd Bowles did. Bills Jets
Espngreeny	683756649803206656	2016-01-03T21:07:43	Jets provided a clinic on how to lose an NFL game
Espngreeny	683756534157979648	2016-01-03T21:07:15	In sports, you generally get what you deserve. Today, right from the opening kick, the Jets deserved to lose.
Espngreeny	683755243725799424	2016-01-03T21:02:08	Time management for the Jets today has been inexcusable. They richly deserve what is happening to them.
Espngreeny	683754425299660800	2016-01-03T20:58:53	Todd Bowles had a very good first year with the Jets. He had a very, very bad last game.
Espngreeny	683742182583459840	2016-01-03T20:10:14	In the long and agonizing history of Jets fandom, this is about twenty minutes away from becoming one of those days we talk about forever.
Espngreeny	683741117658062848	2016-01-03T20:06:00	Very surprised at how badly the Jets have played defense today. With everything on the line, they've been awful.
Espngreeny	683737316385505280	2016-01-03T19:50:54	Deflating. Jets
Espngreeny	683732760494759936	2016-01-03T19:32:47	That was a thoroughly embarrassing half of football by Jets. They have thirty minutes to show they deserve to make the playoffs.
Espngreeny	683731798497574912	2016-01-03T19:28:58	It is inexcusable that there isn't time left for the Jets to try to get points with the wind.
Espngreeny	683731433261772804	2016-01-03T19:27:31	Jets being outplayed, outsmarted and out coached. Why on earth didn't they call timeout in that sequence?
Espngreeny	683703315608244225	2016-01-03T17:35:47	The Browns are about to fire a GM without ever letting him hire a coach. And they change coaches every other year. What a joke.
Espngreeny	683702637468999684	2016-01-03T17:33:06	If I'm a fan of the Giants, I give Tom Coughlin a standing ovation today. Regardless of what happens in the game.
Espngreeny	683702214527987713	2016-01-03T17:31:25	People saying loser of Vikings vs Packers is better off. I don't agree. Both lose next week either way.
Espngreeny	683701973540057088	2016-01-03T17:30:27	Ryan Fitzpatrick is having the best season by a Jets QB this millennium. Today, he leads them to the playoffs.
