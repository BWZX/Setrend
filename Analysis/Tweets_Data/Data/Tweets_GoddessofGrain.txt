GoddessofGrain	723514801654095872	2016-04-22T14:12:25	oldmangord I've actually had guys say they'd prefer that.
GoddessofGrain	723511789460185090	2016-04-22T14:00:27	mlauts84 but it definitely is the most emotional aspect of the business. Fear of missing out is a huge factor of course. Lots of unknowns.
GoddessofGrain	723511626897313792	2016-04-22T13:59:48	mlauts84 it definitely is because it's not as cut and dry as the other aspects. There are ways to take some of the struggle out.
GoddessofGrain	723507402964766721	2016-04-22T13:43:01	dubyadirt sf28430 I can't drink, but I ate my weight in peanut butter crunch. I'm a much happier person now.

GoddessofGrain	723507096038187008	2016-04-22T13:41:48	mlauts84 no. I never recommend 100% before a seed is put in the ground. It's a matter of your costs, ability to withstand risk etc.
GoddessofGrain	723505311215026176	2016-04-22T13:34:42	mlauts84 that's for my Michigan guys of course.
GoddessofGrain	723505218902585345	2016-04-22T13:34:20	mlauts84 I tell most guys to figure your APH. Or a comfortable percentage of it. For easy math we tend to use 40 bpa on beans.
GoddessofGrain	723503895855550465	2016-04-22T13:29:05	mlauts84 that's up to you to determine, if you feel like you should have more committed at these levels you're not comfortably sold.
GoddessofGrain	723498374360526849	2016-04-22T13:07:09	Of course I'm not talking to those of you who have taken advantage of the rally and are comfortably sold.   Know your situation.
GoddessofGrain	723498052133081088	2016-04-22T13:05:52	Now's the time to weigh risk vs reward. If you're willing to risk thousands because your ego is telling you to sell at 10+ use your head.

GoddessofGrain	722064427801927680	2016-04-18T14:09:09	Oh, I feel like I should add, a "fence row" is a line of trees typically used to differentiate between one piece of property and another.
GoddessofGrain	722063480958812160	2016-04-18T14:05:23	If we tried to unfold some of this crap in Michigan it'd get caught in fence rows on both sides. Maybe a slight exaggeration, but still.

GoddessofGrain	722052403172737025	2016-04-18T13:21:22	Expecting oil producing countries to freeze production is like expecting farmers not to plant corn.

GoddessofGrain	718074512034533377	2016-04-07T13:54:39	RhettEp very crowded. Supply growth way outpaced demand. Currency changes didn't help. Pipeline appears plugged for awhile here.
GoddessofGrain	718074185977704448	2016-04-07T13:53:21	RhettEp I agree though, there will be continued growth the supply side will remain the question-it won't be as open to currency flux either
GoddessofGrain	718073970617032705	2016-04-07T13:52:30	RhettEp we thought the same with non-gmo but that market has really changed over the last year and a half-mainly due to increased supply

GoddessofGrain	718073398614577153	2016-04-07T13:50:14	RhettEp hard part is it's not immune from S and D. Increased supply w/out equally increased demand makes for lower premiums eventually
GoddessofGrain	718073178434633729	2016-04-07T13:49:21	RhettEp that's what many don't realize the transitional market isn't super-so they have to take the lower production w/out the premium
GoddessofGrain	718073018543525888	2016-04-07T13:48:43	RhettEp I have a few customers working towards that direction. I wonder how many will continue through the 3 yrs it takes for certification
