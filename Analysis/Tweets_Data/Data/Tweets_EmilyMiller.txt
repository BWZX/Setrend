EmilyMiller	725432866662977536	2016-04-27T21:14:07	Carly's very capable. But Republicans think women vote for women. I'd like to see women vote for policies.  
EmilyMiller	725430744923918336	2016-04-27T21:05:42	Cruz is picking running mate to beat Trump, but Carly Fiorina doesn't bring delegates. Kasich or Rubio would add.  
EmilyMiller	725428690839031808	2016-04-27T20:57:32	Now that Cruz has picked Carly Fiorina as running mate, does Trump have to pick a woman too to run against Hillary? Are we tokens?
EmilyMiller	725423038209097728	2016-04-27T20:35:04	I think Ted Cruz just called Trump "no-good scoundrel, narcissist, abusive and angry." And that he's like Obama in those ways.
EmilyMiller	725412764525678593	2016-04-27T19:54:15	Ted Cruz is appeasing his donors by naming Carly Fiorina as VP.  He may pick up a couple points, but not going to change the race.

EmilyMiller	714950737520930816	2016-03-29T23:01:53	Yes, Trump said he cheated on wife 1. Voters can judge him on it or not. And I hope Cruz says he has been faithful.  
EmilyMiller	714949722805518337	2016-03-29T22:57:51	Joe_In_Texas kevincorke need me huh ?
EmilyMiller	714949623987744768	2016-03-29T22:57:28	It absolutely is the voters' business to know if Cruz is faithful to his wife. It's about telling the truth.

EmilyMiller	714906007147819009	2016-03-29T20:04:09	Cruz won't say he's been faithful to his wife. Trump won't say it's unacceptable to grab women. Republicans are a mess.
EmilyMiller	714895590086328322	2016-03-29T19:22:45	I can't figure out this twist.  
EmilyMiller	714873924807442432	2016-03-29T17:56:40	Assault is illegal for any gender, but it's unethical for a man to hurt a woman because he's bigger and stronger. 
EmilyMiller	714856907601801216	2016-03-29T16:49:02	Trump should say, "It is never okay for a man to grab or hurt a woman." And Lewandowski is presumed innocent 
EmilyMiller	714852655043100672	2016-03-29T16:32:08	I get it's unseemly, but Ted Cruz has to say, "I've never been unfaithful to my wife" or questions linger.

EmilyMiller	685273925882871808	2016-01-08T01:36:50	Watch: Taya's address to President Barack Obama GunsInAmerica, from CNN... 
EmilyMiller	685298580987461632	2016-01-08T03:14:48	Personally, I thought it was chauvinistic when Pres. Obama said the woman could hurt herself with a gun. 
EmilyMiller	685283429458534401	2016-01-08T02:14:36	Pres. Obama makes suicide by gun and murder by gun the same issue. It's like drunk driver vs text and drive. Only one is innocent victim.
EmilyMiller	685279288166330369	2016-01-08T01:58:08	Both Maryland and DC just ended their laws on ballistics - what Obama refers to as tracing shells - because never solved a crime.
EmilyMiller	685278889829117952	2016-01-08T01:56:33	I cover local news shootings almost ever day in DC. I've never reported on a shooting in which the gun was bought retail.
EmilyMiller	685278680873078784	2016-01-08T01:55:44	I've been watching Pres. Obama, and I still don't get how his plan stops criminals from buying guns on the streets or stealing them.
EmilyMiller	685272720884559872	2016-01-08T01:32:03	EmilyMiller I've been to 5 gun shows in Indiana and all conduct background checks on gun purchases. GunsInAmerica
EmilyMiller	685273484486914048	2016-01-08T01:35:05	EmilyMiller  Here's what the DoJ says about that. 1/5 is bigger than 1/2 in guessing.  
EmilyMiller	685275375119790080	2016-01-08T01:42:35	The horror of those children killed at Newtown makes me cry too.
EmilyMiller	685274860281573377	2016-01-08T01:40:33	Here are some important points about the "gun show loophole" that Pres. Obama didn't mention. In my book - 
EmilyMiller	685272494144667648	2016-01-08T01:31:09	Obama tells a rape victim that a gun may not make her safer. 
EmilyMiller	685271074058203139	2016-01-08T01:25:30	Pres. Obama keeps going back to the trusts issue that ATF gives permits -automatic guns etc- which are NEVER used in crimes.
EmilyMiller	685270317959352320	2016-01-08T01:22:30	Pres. Obama concedes that violent crime has been decreasing for decades. He says it has nothing to do with high gun ownership.
EmilyMiller	685269798775840769	2016-01-08T01:20:26	Chris Kyle's widow is amazing to stand up to Pres. Obama on live national TV and make powerful argument. She's so impressive.
EmilyMiller	685269015518920704	2016-01-08T01:17:19	Pres. Obama on meeting with the NRA- It would have to be based on facts and truth...Not fiction that Obama is trying to take away your guns.
EmilyMiller	685268208543232005	2016-01-08T01:14:07	It's no coincidence that CNN has this town hall on gun control with Obama in same county as NRA.
EmilyMiller	685267930045624324	2016-01-08T01:13:00	Morgan_Cody_1 goodness no. I'm a rule follower and plus it's so staged
EmilyMiller	685267667108933637	2016-01-08T01:11:58	To his credit, Anderson Cooper clarified to Obama that less that 1% of guns are from gun shows.
EmilyMiller	685267189562241024	2016-01-08T01:10:04	Pres. Obama just said. the guns in Chicago crimes are coming from gun shows in Indiana.

EmilyMiller	685260402117066752	2016-01-08T00:43:06	CNN says they came to White House with gun control town hall idea. But does that matter?

EmilyMiller	685219179625078784	2016-01-07T21:59:17	When I interviewed realDonaldTrump for my book, he said a lot of people agree with Obama on gun control, but... 
EmilyMiller	685204409811353601	2016-01-07T21:00:36	I think I will read HandsOffMyGun, AssaultAndFlattery or EmilyGetsHerGun rather than watch the town hall. 2A DLoesch EmilyMiller

EmilyMiller	684476553225461762	2016-01-05T20:48:21	When Obama proposed smart gun laws in 2013, this Justice report said it's "unlikely to affect gun crime." My book:

EmilyMiller	682361586992988160	2015-12-31T00:44:14	EmilyMiller reports DC replaces confusing parking signs in 'tow trap zone'  
EmilyMiller	682410237995958273	2015-12-31T03:57:33	I totally disagree. ISIS picked a theater in Paris for a reason. Police are trained in active shooter. We are not.
