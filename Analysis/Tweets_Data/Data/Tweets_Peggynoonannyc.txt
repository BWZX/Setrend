Peggynoonannyc	693514185112698880	2016-01-30T19:20:41	But it was beautiful. Think how it would look reflected in the shiny glass of a gleaming modern tower.

Peggynoonannyc	692854670008561665	2016-01-28T23:40:00	Oh a number of us have been saying that, for more than a month. 
Peggynoonannyc	692850242861928448	2016-01-28T23:22:25	"Deriding Trump is an act of class solidarity."  A small masterpiece from Tucker Carlson.

Peggynoonannyc	692734642730987520	2016-01-28T15:43:03	He was indeed. A great young man.  
Peggynoonannyc	692733882983174144	2016-01-28T15:40:02	Peggynoonannyc - went home that day and watched Pres. Reagan's speech with my sister and parents. We cried together as a family &amp; a nation.
Peggynoonannyc	692732705209974784	2016-01-28T15:35:21	Last note. The brilliant, big-hearted Bently Elliot, head of speechwriting, pulled it all together and made everything work. Some guy.
Peggynoonannyc	692731965217316864	2016-01-28T15:32:25	In chaos things happen and get said.  But I never knew Regan said this, word didn't reach me. I was already at work. 
Peggynoonannyc	692730529838424064	2016-01-28T15:26:43	Must have been especially painful/upsetting for NASA kids.  
Peggynoonannyc	692729922536763392	2016-01-28T15:24:18	I actually dont know how to do that.  Could you, and I will retweet?

Peggynoonannyc	692728640862298113	2016-01-28T15:19:12	This. And it felt like every teacher we saw that day was Christa McAuliffe. And their horror was ours... Challenger 
Peggynoonannyc	692728683556134913	2016-01-28T15:19:23	In a way it's about being an unimportant person in a historic, powerful place. In part it's about love. 
Peggynoonannyc	692727907844751362	2016-01-28T15:16:18	Ha!  No. But Reagan loved Service's work and could recite reams of it from memory.  
Peggynoonannyc	692726697041489921	2016-01-28T15:11:29	Birch Lane grade school, Berner high school for two years, then we moved. Still go back to Massapequa.  
Peggynoonannyc	692726241955332098	2016-01-28T15:09:40	Yes.  
Peggynoonannyc	692726066289467392	2016-01-28T15:08:59	Yes. Only afterward did we understand this.  One element: as when JFK died, the faces on the teachers were stricken. 
Peggynoonannyc	692725635098218496	2016-01-28T15:07:16	I'm filled with gratitude at having been where I was when I was, and with Reagan. 
Peggynoonannyc	692724938298499072	2016-01-28T15:04:30	Yes, Airmen loved it.  
Peggynoonannyc	692724790705143809	2016-01-28T15:03:54	To this day I meet people aged 37 or 45, and they come up and say, "I was one of the kids watching it in the school auditorium that day..."
Peggynoonannyc	692723468798967809	2016-01-28T14:58:39	I learned it in 7th grade too, at McKenna Junior High in Massapequa, LI.  
Peggynoonannyc	692721812598329344	2016-01-28T14:52:04	Which was Lincoln's word for what an effective speech does.  Anyway, an awkward painful scattered day for all.  Nice: Magee poem known again
Peggynoonannyc	692721080822296577	2016-01-28T14:49:10	But in the flurry of the day my CBS mistake was hardly noticed.  Went home that night upset about it, and feeling the speech hadn't scoured
Peggynoonannyc	692720541338312704	2016-01-28T14:47:01	An anchor knew part of what the President would say in advance. Break of protocol in those days. I told the boss and was chastised. /12?
Peggynoonannyc	692719952982327297	2016-01-28T14:44:41	I watched, heart in mouth. Oh no!  Then the president came on, gave his speech, used the quote.  Relief.  But I had to tell my boss. /11
Peggynoonannyc	692719394175225856	2016-01-28T14:42:28	The CBS person got the Magee poem and gave it to anchor Dan Rather. But wires got crossed.  He read part of the poem before Reagan spoke./10
Peggynoonannyc	692718772373884928	2016-01-28T14:40:00	I told her the president may quote a poem at the end. Told her name and author.  Thinking maybe after the speech they can read poem aloud./9
Peggynoonannyc	692717915146227713	2016-01-28T14:36:35	Then an old friend I worked with at CBS called.  Anything we should know about the speech?  Stupidly, dumbly, I said yes. /8
Peggynoonannyc	692716892990148608	2016-01-28T14:32:32	As a precaution I called the press office -- if reporters ask about the end of the speech it quotes poem by JG Magee, Jr.  All set. /6
Peggynoonannyc	692716075327291392	2016-01-28T14:29:17	Speech went out within WH for comment. All busy, chaos, tension.  Didn't know if RR would use the poem, he would if he knew it, if not no./5
Peggynoonannyc	692714993150730240	2016-01-28T14:24:59	So I thought, it's a famous enough poem that some will get the reference. I decided: put the Magee poem in quotes, without citation. /4
Peggynoonannyc	692713897829253122	2016-01-28T14:20:37	The end of the speech would not have worked and done its job.  Clunky, awkward, would take you from RR's thought to "Who's Magee?"
Peggynoonannyc	692713455967670272	2016-01-28T14:18:52	The Magee poem, High Flight, posed a challenge in the text.  If the president quoted it w the preface , "As the poet JG Magee put it..." /2
Peggynoonannyc	692711851533139968	2016-01-28T14:12:30	Had a memory this morning that's lodged in my mind. Dont think I've ever spoken of it, though maybe I have. Small sidebar to Challenger. /1

Peggynoonannyc	686394360351584258	2016-01-11T03:49:02	This would strike me as subtly dismissing of her 4 years as Secretary of State.   
Peggynoonannyc	686393869286637570	2016-01-11T03:47:05	Thank you, Mr. President, or rather Ron, that's helpful.   
Peggynoonannyc	686393292133642240	2016-01-11T03:44:48	2/. To call her Hillary, as everyone actually does, is too familiar, not respectful.  So: Mrs Clinton. No disrespect 
Peggynoonannyc	686392186766798848	2016-01-11T03:40:24	"Senator" no longer operative. "Former senator" not right. "Former Secretary of State" too much wordage, awkward. 
Peggynoonannyc	686390535125360640	2016-01-11T03:33:50	You trumped me fair and square, LMA. Couldn't stay interested. Most of those I admire could.  
Peggynoonannyc	686288206866845698	2016-01-10T20:47:13	I hope a great American newspaper will do a big, deeply reported piece on what happened &amp; how news was suppressed. 
Peggynoonannyc	686277844993978369	2016-01-10T20:06:03	Thank you, Steve! 
Peggynoonannyc	686277511890743296	2016-01-10T20:04:43	No, thanks for asking.  Assume it was concocted by a Trump supporter.   
Peggynoonannyc	686276089958776832	2016-01-10T19:59:04	Thank you, Nick.  
Peggynoonannyc	686275832617242624	2016-01-10T19:58:03	No, thanks for asking.  Someone, presumably a Trump supporter, concocted it and used my name.  Not me, not WSJ.

Peggynoonannyc	685297319944798208	2016-01-08T03:09:47	The GOP establishment is having a civil war: 
Peggynoonannyc	685212626087997440	2016-01-07T21:33:15	Thanks, Pete. 
Peggynoonannyc	685169169554358272	2016-01-07T18:40:34	Thank you, Tommy. 
Peggynoonannyc	684930249080070144	2016-01-07T02:51:11	Thank you, Mark.  'People wonder about the purpose of establishments. That is the purpose of establishments.'

Peggynoonannyc	684902422637051904	2016-01-07T01:00:37	'Someone killed him, we didnt ask who, I let it go...' 
Peggynoonannyc	684902193946845184	2016-01-07T00:59:42	Ouch.  You're starting to win.  Godfather people come to the fore, gotta go to dinner.  
Peggynoonannyc	684901558488842241	2016-01-07T00:57:11	Final thought before dinner.  Hyman Roth's speech -- 'That man's name was Moe Green...' -- was a true masterpiece. 
Peggynoonannyc	684900107125436416	2016-01-07T00:51:25	Oh yes!  But Godfather too, both, very brilliant scripts.  
Peggynoonannyc	684899602563231745	2016-01-07T00:49:24	That is great dialogue but...has it entered the language? 
Peggynoonannyc	684898948855795712	2016-01-07T00:46:48	Oh how could I forget 'Of all the gin joints...'  Also just remembered 'We'll always have Paris.' 
Peggynoonannyc	684898433921069056	2016-01-07T00:44:46	We shouldnt be on twitter at dinnertime but this is the business we've chosen.

Peggynoonannyc	684894943295451136	2016-01-07T00:30:53	Godfather 1 and 2.  More lines entered the language from those two than any other movies of the 20th century. 
Peggynoonannyc	684864537988849664	2016-01-06T22:30:04	The time to hesitate is through!

Peggynoonannyc	683400447516913664	2016-01-02T21:32:18	This year we could see the GOP split. That, I think, is what I‚Äôm seeing among the Republicans, a slow-motion break. 
Peggynoonannyc	683399846682857472	2016-01-02T21:29:55	The biggest question for 2016: whether the Republican party splits apart.
