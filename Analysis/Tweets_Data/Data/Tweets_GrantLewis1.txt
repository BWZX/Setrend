GrantLewis1	725763667980107777	2016-04-28T19:08:37	andrew_lilico JohnSpringford so you keep asserting. But surely we just leave and stop paying?
GrantLewis1	725760952965156866	2016-04-28T18:57:49	andrew_lilico JohnSpringford if vote out, they will want exit and end to free movement this Parliament. That's clear.
GrantLewis1	725758842462679040	2016-04-28T18:49:26	DuncanWeldon Birdyword xvrmdf indeed. Some rather large externalities by preventing secular stagnation
GrantLewis1	725758578460598274	2016-04-28T18:48:23	andrew_lilico JohnSpringford don't agree. But even if you're right your assumption doesn't satisfy their demands until 2023 at earliest
GrantLewis1	725757483592069120	2016-04-28T18:44:02	Birdyword DuncanWeldon xvrmdf so you don't think fiscal policy can sufficiently raise nominal GDP growth?

GrantLewis1	725747326426484737	2016-04-28T18:03:41	andrew_lilico JohnSpringford and you think your supporters from UKIP are going to tolerate free movement for another 7 years or more?
GrantLewis1	725744980896145408	2016-04-28T17:54:21	andrew_lilico JohnSpringford so we will have effectively the same status as Norway?
GrantLewis1	725741548030287872	2016-04-28T17:40:43	andrew_lilico JohnSpringford why not? EU won't give UK continued single mkt membership without free movement and payment
GrantLewis1	725724961164410881	2016-04-28T16:34:48	andrew_lilico JohnSpringford seems as good an assumption as any given total lack of knowledge about future trade arrangements
GrantLewis1	725722556406349825	2016-04-28T16:25:15	andrew_lilico so the only valid, plausible bit is the estimate of the cost to the EU of UK leaving?
GrantLewis1	725721465987960832	2016-04-28T16:20:55	andrew_lilico So the OECD report is a valid assessment?

GrantLewis1	715482753437814784	2016-03-31T10:15:56	DuncanWeldon true. I guess it depends on how optimistic you are about returns recovering overseas. If they don't £ has to eventually fall
