benhuh	724683604224294916	2016-04-25T19:36:49	6/ A migrant moves countries because of the opportunities. If you look at any "expat" they're doing the same for career or personal growth.

benhuh	724682561373507588	2016-04-25T19:32:41	4/ Whereas people of color or migrants from developing countries are usually called immigrants, whether they plan to immigrate or not.
benhuh	724682211530813440	2016-04-25T19:31:17	3/ "Expatriate" by defn. is anyone living outside their home country. But in practice, it's only used to denote 1st-worlders, mostly white.

benhuh	723401298914086914	2016-04-22T06:41:24	appleseedexm I'm pretty sure they also rely on tips. They tend to be more career service workers who've been doing it longer.

benhuh	723398917337931776	2016-04-22T06:31:56	7/ WA law prevent pooling of tips. When $15 wage kicks in, cooks &amp; others lose out. Waitstaff wins big. Well intentioned law, but unfair.
benhuh	723397923422130177	2016-04-22T06:27:59	kentgoldman msg that's just tipping through another metric. Still ripe for subjectivity based on looks, gender, color.
benhuh	723397551311876096	2016-04-22T06:26:30	appleseedexm well, it really depends on your defn. of "good". There is an agreed standard on what a living wage constitutes in most cities.
benhuh	723397290166120450	2016-04-22T06:25:28	6/ In rest. waitstaff gets the tip. But what about the host? Busser? Chef? All integral to my exp. Taxi? What about dispatch? Maintenance?

benhuh	723396420259074049	2016-04-22T06:22:01	5/ Because let's face it. Tipless cultures often provide better service b/c they have pride in quality of their service &amp; can live on wage.
benhuh	723396095171121152	2016-04-22T06:20:43	4/ If you want a fairer service econ. society, eliminate tips &amp; add a) mandatory service charges that go 100% to staff or b) pay living wage
benhuh	723395552138797056	2016-04-22T06:18:34	3/ Studies show repeatedly no correlation bet. tips &amp; good service. Fact: tips increase based on skin color, looks, &amp; smiley face on checks.
benhuh	723395161602953217	2016-04-22T06:17:01	2/ After traveling to 30+ countries &amp; researching the myriad of tipping rules, I detest ambiguity and the entitlement of tips. It's tiring.
benhuh	723394827212062723	2016-04-22T06:15:41	1/ Tipping needs to be replaced with a mandatory service charge or just a living wage. Uber allowing drivers to ask for tips is regression.

benhuh	723145995387846656	2016-04-21T13:46:55	KristinTangel julieinduvall yeah, Seattle traffic went bad last 10 years, driven by high housing prices and unsuitable geography.

benhuh	723139603268538368	2016-04-21T13:21:31	kirillzubovsky my takeaway w/ him is that he is so angry &amp; pessimistic now, that he'd be a hard hire. He needs some small wins. Find hope.
benhuh	723139257762766849	2016-04-21T13:20:08	moorehn emilybell the productivity costs of waiting at airport for hours is ridiculous. It's a tax on the economy.
benhuh	723139068092112896	2016-04-21T13:19:23	9/ His exp. w/ social asst was terrible: bureaucratic, slow, mistrustful. I encouraged him to research universal basic income. He needs hope
benhuh	723138419594014720	2016-04-21T13:16:49	ericnakagawa my experience is the same
benhuh	723138272675926016	2016-04-21T13:16:14	kirillzubovsky I didn't get a sense that he made poor decisions. A job as a barista isn't a poor choice if there are no better options
benhuh	723137956207316992	2016-04-21T13:14:58	kirillzubovsky but cities also benefit greatly from diversity and new faces. Increasingly, cities are turning into gated communities.

benhuh	723136600855707648	2016-04-21T13:09:35	BWJones harper I was surprised to find someone smart, educated and articulate left behind to a point he was homeless.
benhuh	723136239877152768	2016-04-21T13:08:09	7/ We are driving next gen out of the best cities, driving them away from productivity and innovation. The old shall inherit the cities.
benhuh	723135895189229568	2016-04-21T13:06:47	6/ Saddest part was that he didn't seem hopeful. No optimism. His exp in Seattle has been 3 years of terror. He is leaving soon, back to FL.

benhuh	723135246888239104	2016-04-21T13:04:12	5/ His entire adult life has been a struggle to get head above water. He is barely making a living on rideshares. His anger was palpable.
benhuh	723134979379736576	2016-04-21T13:03:08	4/ A $3 increase per hr would have prevented him becoming homeless. He wants to unionize Lyft/Uber and "the system needs to be destroyed."
benhuh	723134626701672449	2016-04-21T13:01:44	3/ his stats were way off on what was happening in Seattle in terms of increase in pop, &amp; # of H1B visas. He blamed NIMBYS, foreign workers
benhuh	723134348849995776	2016-04-21T13:00:38	2/ Graduated with honors. Moved to Seattle 2013, made min wage at Starbucks, lost apartment due to rising prices. He was angry at everyone.
benhuh	723133970733498368	2016-04-21T12:59:08	1/ Had a gut wrenching chat with a Millennial Lyft driver last night about being homeless w/ a college degree and his anger at the system.
