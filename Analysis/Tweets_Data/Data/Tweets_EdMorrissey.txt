EdMorrissey	725675476816003074	2016-04-28T13:18:10	AriMelber There was a lot more to it than that. 
EdMorrissey	725674392043278336	2016-04-28T13:13:52	. EdMorrissey It was seen as desperate, hurt Reagan w conservatives like Helms, set up first losing convention vote 
EdMorrissey	725674563036549123	2016-04-28T13:14:32	AriMelber In other words, I don't think he lost that rules vote in '76 *because* he picked Schweiker, but that it didn't help him win it.
EdMorrissey	725673976165355520	2016-04-28T13:12:12	AriMelber By '80. he just didn't need to pull a rabbit out of a hat to win the nomination. He had it sewn up.
EdMorrissey	725673802881888256	2016-04-28T13:11:31	AriMelber I think the worst that can be said about the 76 gambit was that it just didn't work. I don't think it damaged him.
EdMorrissey	725673310504161280	2016-04-28T13:09:34	AriMelber OK, fair enough! Should have clicked.  HallieJackson VaughnHillyard PeterAlexander mmurraypolitics

EdMorrissey	724431396303859712	2016-04-25T02:54:38	Heh. RT moelane EdMorrissey Super PACs are notoriously hard of hearing.
EdMorrissey	724430917926707200	2016-04-25T02:52:44	Before this, Kasich was the logical running mate choice for *both* Trump and Cruz. 
EdMorrissey	724430731577974785	2016-04-25T02:52:00	Timodc KevinNR Fair enough, but if you stop GOTV activities, it would certainly impact the outcome. But I see your point.
EdMorrissey	724430483820400640	2016-04-25T02:51:01	EdMorrissey KevinNR risky. Some voters won't get the message
EdMorrissey	724430222989221888	2016-04-25T02:49:59	Timodc KevinNR Indiana's over a week away. Just don't show up there any more, and the message would be clear without being explicit.
EdMorrissey	724430023709466625	2016-04-25T02:49:11	Another thought: Clearly, Kasich's not going to throw his support to Trump in a contested convention. That was still a possibility before.

EdMorrissey	724423689282949121	2016-04-25T02:24:01	Notably, Cruz is "ceding" two states where votes are proportional, so he'd be forfeiting far less delegates. 
EdMorrissey	724429035984424960	2016-04-25T02:45:16	One other thought about Cruz-Kasich deal: Wouldn't it have been a lot smarter not to talk about it?

EdMorrissey	724426329202913280	2016-04-25T02:34:30	One interesting aspect of the Cruz-Kasich deal: Cruz winds up with a state the GOP can win in Nov, while Kasich gets pretty solid Dem states

EdMorrissey	708113087581134850	2016-03-11T02:11:30	Note that all four Republicans are orienting themselves away from free trade, at least somewhat. Earlier today:

EdMorrissey	708111832699940864	2016-03-11T02:06:31	Good answer from Trump on visas and trade. That's the best answer from him on his own outsourcing vs his rhetoric on it.
