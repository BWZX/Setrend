petersuderman	722890721909342208	2016-04-20T20:52:33	Subtext is that Preibus has glued the Johnnie Walker to his hand &amp; is drinking Bailey's straight from the bottle 
petersuderman	722889898923921408	2016-04-20T20:49:17	dariustahir I kind of am. Wary too, but Villeneuve has exactly the right sensibility, and Roger Deakins makes any movie worth seeing.

petersuderman	722844469389864961	2016-04-20T17:48:45	The GOP primary is about to get very, very weird:

petersuderman	722811008419565568	2016-04-20T15:35:48	On Kevin Costner and the decline of the movie star: 
petersuderman	722782109358809088	2016-04-20T13:40:58	"A week from now, Trump might be having an even better night."

petersuderman	722642007416573952	2016-04-20T04:24:15	So much of the primary process is governed by norms and history. But we're rapidly headed beyond both. Like the end of Star Trek V.

petersuderman	722640427430645760	2016-04-20T04:17:58	No one really knows how the Weird Zone works. That's why it's Weird. Sure, Trump doesn't own the nom if he only takes 1214 delegates. But...
petersuderman	722639993756327936	2016-04-20T04:16:15	We are rapidly headed into the Weird Zone, where Trump gets almost enough delegates to clinch the nom, but not quite.
