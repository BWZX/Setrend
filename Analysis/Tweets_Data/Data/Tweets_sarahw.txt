sarahw	708314120056131589	2016-03-11T15:30:20	beth_parker the secrecy with the will certainly does not help (though I can also understand it, after a fashion)
sarahw	708313707865100288	2016-03-11T15:28:42	beth_parker generally I agree with you; in this case though, I'm not sure the most shady scenario necessarily applies.

sarahw	707374463952797696	2016-03-09T01:16:29	37. OK,  truly the last one. Time to go back a bit more than a century to Marie Belloc Lowndes' THE LODGER (1914). Ur-domestic suspense.
sarahw	707374196377194496	2016-03-09T01:15:25	36. Les Canadiennes. Louise Penny, obviously. (a different book type under series guise.) Gail Bowen. And Alison Gordon, still so missed.
sarahw	707373805996482561	2016-03-09T01:13:52	35. Celia Fremlin, who wrote psychological suspense with tremendous insight/nerve. THE HOURS BEFORE DAWN nailed post-partum depression.
sarahw	707373491910262785	2016-03-09T01:12:37	34. Every author recommended in the links in #32? Go plumb their backlists, there are so many gems among them. Yes this is a cheat.
sarahw	707373058743525376	2016-03-09T01:10:54	33. Carol O'Connell, because Mallory is the ultimate DGAF protagonist, and also because of standalones like JUDAS CHILD &amp; BONE BY BONE.
sarahw	707372217680699392	2016-03-09T01:07:33	32. I've already read a bunch of great crime novels by women out now/coming soon. See  &amp; 
sarahw	707371635330965504	2016-03-09T01:05:14	31. Friend &amp; fellow expat hilarydavidson came up with a twist in her standalone BLOOD ALWAYS TELLS that totally floored me. Still marvel.
sarahw	707371097877041152	2016-03-09T01:03:06	30. Who remembers Kim Wozencraft? Am I a fan club of one? RUSH, WANTED THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, but nothing in last 10 years. A pity.
sarahw	707370702404460544	2016-03-09T01:01:32	29. Reading BEAT NOT THE BONES by Charlotte Jay was like having a snake slither up and down my spine. Deserved first Edgar Best Novel win.
sarahw	707370444471586816	2016-03-09T01:00:30	28. Elisabeth Sanxay Holding anticipated everybody - Highsmith, domestic suspense -- with novels like THE BLANK WALL and INNOCENT MRS. DUFF.
sarahw	707370199067004929	2016-03-09T00:59:32	27. On to Scotland: my favorite valmcdermid novels are A PLACE OF EXECUTION and THE GRAVE TATTOO. DameDeniseMina? Paddy Meehan series rn.
sarahw	707369668181417984	2016-03-09T00:57:25	26. Dorothy Salisbury Davis! One of the highlights of my life to know her a bit towards the end of her life. A GENTLE MURDERER's my fave.
sarahw	707369460445929472	2016-03-09T00:56:36	25. Nedra Tyre was more consistent with short stories (reprinted 1 in TDTW) but THE INTRUDER (1954) is a model study of passive-aggression.
sarahw	707369177816944644	2016-03-09T00:55:28	24. Jen Sacks wrote a brilliant novel called NICE (1998), a love story between a woman who kills to avoid breakups and a smitten hitman.
sarahw	707368592115945474	2016-03-09T00:53:09	23b. Dorothy Sayers (HAVE HIS CARCASE and GAUDY NIGHT rank high here) and Ngaio Marsh. And Josephine Tey, for DAUGHTER OF TIME above all.
sarahw	707368218634166273	2016-03-09T00:51:40	23a. The Golden Age "Queens of Crime"! Agatha Christie of course (gotta plug ENDLESS NIGHT.) Margery Allingham (TIGER &amp; THE SMOKE.)
sarahw	707367892124364800	2016-03-09T00:50:22	22. Jan_Burke was also part of formative (for me) group. There's a reason why BONES (1999) beat out a stellar group of books for the Edgar.
sarahw	707367599831707648	2016-03-09T00:49:12	21. SJRozan was one of the authors who got me into crime fiction in a serious way in the late 1990s. Smith/Chin series, also ABSENT FRIENDS
sarahw	707356960262397952	2016-03-09T00:06:56	(LOL at me thinking I could keep it to twenty tweets. I have to take a break now, but I'll be back to finish later in the evening.)
sarahw	707356670779858944	2016-03-09T00:05:47	20. Anything Katy Munger writes under every name. But especially her Casey Jones series: no-bullshit heroine, great North Carolina setting.
sarahw	707356345138352128	2016-03-09T00:04:29	19. MsRebeccaChance used to write (as Lauren Henderson) a series featuring PI Sam Jones. I loved and love those books. FREEZE MY MARGARITA!
sarahw	707355726113542144	2016-03-09T00:02:01	18. Dolores Hitchens is back in circulation after too long out of it. FOOL'S GOLD, THE WATCHER, &amp; fantastic PI novel SLEEP WITH SLANDER.
sarahw	707355172645834754	2016-03-08T23:59:49	17. Charlotte Armstrong was also consistently excellent. MISCHIEF's in WCW but also: THE GIFT SHOP, THE BALLOON MAN, &amp; LEMON IN THE BASKET.
sarahw	707354894123016192	2016-03-08T23:58:43	16. Margaret Millar! BEAST IN VIEW of course but also HOW LIKE AN ANGEL (I like that PI more than Lew Archer) and THE FIEND, so audacious.
sarahw	707354561523089408	2016-03-08T23:57:24	15. And Sara Gran, still have chills from reading COME CLOSER in a single sitting a decade and a half ago. The Claire DeWitt books. &amp; DOPE.
sarahw	707354363103055872	2016-03-08T23:56:36	14. I got a request for Craig Rice and hands-down my favorite of hers is HOME SWEET HOMICIDE (1944) where the kids solve a murder &amp; more.
sarahw	707354029735747585	2016-03-08T23:55:17	13. Japan: Masako Tagawa was reigning lady in 50s/60s/etc. (LADY KILLER, THE MASTER KEY.) Current crime queen is Natsuo Kirino (OUT, omg)
sarahw	707353576415350784	2016-03-08T23:53:29	12. Let's go international. Scandinavian first: Karin Fossum, Karin Alvtegen, Lene Kaaberbol &amp; Agnete Friis (THE BOY IN THE SUITCASE!)
sarahw	707352961983365121	2016-03-08T23:51:02	11. Jodi Compton! So many excellent thrillers. THE 37TH HOUR. HAILEY'S WAR. THIEVES GET RICH, SAINTS GET SHOT. A natural hardboiled vibe.
sarahw	707352546403340288	2016-03-08T23:49:23	10. After you read Vera Caspary's wonderful LAURA get a hold of her 1979 autobiography THE SECRETS OF GROWNUPS. What a proto-feminist life!
sarahw	707352207969153025	2016-03-08T23:48:03	9. Jen Banbury's moved on to other things (and her journalism is great) but oh lord, her 1998 novel LIKE A HOLE IN THE HEAD was so, so good.
sarahw	707351687686705152	2016-03-08T23:45:58	(con't O'Callaghan introduced West in 1974 in an issue of Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine, later wrote several novels featuring her.)
sarahw	707351387030560768	2016-03-08T23:44:47	8. Sue Grafton, Marcia Muller, Sara Paretsky? All crucial to development of female PI. Maxine O'Callaghan got there first with Delilah West.
sarahw	707350797584089088	2016-03-08T23:42:26	7. Modern domestic suspense would not be possible without Mary Higgins Clark. Full stop. Go with WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN? (1975) first.
sarahw	707350444734078976	2016-03-08T23:41:02	6. I still think so much and so vividly about two novels by NichelleTramble: THE DYING GROUND (2003) &amp; THE LAST KING (2004).
sarahw	707349827278020608	2016-03-08T23:38:35	5. atticalocke got longlisted for BaileysPrize yesterday for PLEASANTVILLE. Read its prequel BLACK WATER RISING &amp; THE CUTTING SEASON too.
sarahw	707349358228983809	2016-03-08T23:36:43	4. Already a Patricia Highsmith request! My choice: THE GLASS CELL (1964) a bleak, devastating look at a wrongful conviction &amp; aftermath.
sarahw	707348746766520320	2016-03-08T23:34:17	3. I wish Jenny Siler got more attention. EASY MONEY (1998) knocked me flat when I read it. Her spy thrillers (as Alex Carr) are great, too.
sarahw	707348455543414784	2016-03-08T23:33:08	2. But also definitely pick up Hughes' final novel THE EXPENDABLE MAN (1963), a standout examination of race and privilege. nyrbclassics
sarahw	707348157869527040	2016-03-08T23:31:57	1. First up is my favorite crime novel, not a secret since I talk about this all the time: IN A LONELY PLACE by Dorothy B. Hughes (1947).
sarahw	707347931725230082	2016-03-08T23:31:03	OK let's start. Probably going to do about 20 (?) of these in total. 
sarahw	707331653450993664	2016-03-08T22:26:22	KrisRad just a bad joke about the Hulk Hogan/Gawker trial, nothing to see here

sarahw	707328819145871360	2016-03-08T22:15:06	All day long at DBW16 I've been hearing about the discoverability problem and turns out we should have been asking lawyers all along

sarahw	707289120284999681	2016-03-08T19:37:21	(I have been at dbw16 all day and it's fine but I just don't feel like tweeting about it.)
