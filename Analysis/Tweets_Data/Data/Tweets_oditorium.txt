oditorium	725400172579180544	2016-04-27T19:04:13	ellegist chrisjv91 I know, it's ironic. but the point is, the UK was very influential there, even though it might wish it had not been
oditorium	725398793781387264	2016-04-27T18:58:44	ellegist chrisjv91 an older example are steel tariffs--the UK was pivotal in keeping them low I believe
oditorium	725398056263405568	2016-04-27T18:55:48	ellegist chrisjv91 very important recent example is Euro securities clearing--would have moved to EZ without UK influence
oditorium	725397578192420866	2016-04-27T18:53:54	ellegist chrisjv91 firstly, it is the Council that still matters more, so it is the elected UK government rather than the MEPs that count
oditorium	725397062825725952	2016-04-27T18:51:51	ellegist chrisjv91 outside the EU it has full control over a rather small market--where can it do more good if it so wants?
oditorium	725396895321985024	2016-04-27T18:51:11	ellegist chrisjv91 point is: within EU the UK has significant influence on a very big market
oditorium	725396679697027072	2016-04-27T18:50:20	ellegist chrisjv91 put it that way: without UK in the EU those tariffs might go to say 15pc bc of less opposition
oditorium	725395728227549184	2016-04-27T18:46:33	ellegist chrisjv91 ...than if UK leaves and those countries get the benefit of lower tariffs in a small market
oditorium	725395390804168704	2016-04-27T18:45:13	ellegist chrisjv91 I dont disagree; but they will actually be better off if the UK stays in the EU and manages to keep tariffs down...
oditorium	725394435203317760	2016-04-27T18:41:25	ellegist chrisjv91 you really think 7.5% make a significant difference here? would UK suddenly drink Africa roasted coffee?
oditorium	725393996974055424	2016-04-27T18:39:40	ellegist chrisjv91 the tariff for roasted coffee is 7.5%--this does not quite allow you to "make a fortune" esp on higher cost base
oditorium	725393232444706817	2016-04-27T18:36:38	ellegist chrisjv91 so what would brexit change for the coffee producers?

oditorium	713342306980601856	2016-03-25T12:30:33	chrys0111 for numerics you can write extremely optimised code in it (almost as good as FORTRAN...) but piping data in an out is a pain
oditorium	713341804607877120	2016-03-25T12:28:34	chrys0111 I have programmed for years in C actually, creating options pricing libraries
oditorium	713341367485861888	2016-03-25T12:26:49	chrys0111 so yeah, database drivers you probably want to write in C, but not the application logic
oditorium	713341129207496704	2016-03-25T12:25:53	chrys0111 easily parallelisable--just throw more CPUs at it; in any case, the database will be the bottleneck for this

oditorium	713339123965292544	2016-03-25T12:17:55	chrys0111 not sure in the MS world, my impression is that C# is essentially PHP but I might be wrong
oditorium	713338714924171265	2016-03-25T12:16:17	chrys0111 Rails and Django are my preferences at the moment--mature enough but not too old
oditorium	713338248685297664	2016-03-25T12:14:26	chrys0111 Node clearly seems to he winning at the moment even though their dependency hell is rather scary
oditorium	713337760254410752	2016-03-25T12:12:29	dgwbirch but like if you're tweeting "I just robbed a bank"--technically it might be because of the tweet, but the ultimate cause differs
oditorium	713337301032677377	2016-03-25T12:10:40	dgwbirch was thinking that as well; but actually, arguably accosting the woman in that matter is the actual offense he publicly admitted

oditorium	713334796710227968	2016-03-25T12:00:43	chrys0111 that wasnt my point: PHP is tomorrow's COBOL, it already shows its age; by the time Fintech rules the world it will be COBOL
oditorium	713334145531953152	2016-03-25T11:58:08	dsquareddigest and of course Node is what the cool kids of Fintech do
oditorium	713334066154749952	2016-03-25T11:57:49	dsquareddigest which makes me very bearish on Node that they ever sort out their dependencies hell--did you follow this?

oditorium	710826801161969664	2016-03-18T13:54:50	cjsnowdon the key point though is that there was obviously a very big fight going on to keep stevia banned for so long

oditorium	709048640011112448	2016-03-13T16:09:03	grodaeu that's fair--but the issue in particular in Stockholm is trust bc you have some bad operators out there, and you know Uber

oditorium	708946434570248192	2016-03-13T09:22:56	AbeLolisted cobrollins probably true; on the other hand, simply getting rid of â¬500 is also not that difficult to do, so it is a wash
oditorium	708943235230638081	2016-03-13T09:10:13	cobrollins AbeLolisted yet another argument against â¬500 notes: the %cost of reliably forging smaller denom notes is much higher

oditorium	708941160711131136	2016-03-13T09:01:58	AbeLolisted on second thought, it is self-fulfilling: if this is the only security feature in the note then any that passes IS real
oditorium	708940998173401089	2016-03-13T09:01:20	AbeLolisted surely forgers can now produce notes that will trick this pen?
oditorium	708940344860221441	2016-03-13T08:58:44	AbeLolisted I guess their margins are so high that even if they run into the occasional forged $100 they just eat the loss...

oditorium	708938508203855872	2016-03-13T08:51:26	AbeLolisted highest denom in US is $100, correct? and would those shops accept $100 notes, or is it the usual 20's only rule?

oditorium	708936635552043009	2016-03-13T08:43:59	AbeLolisted cobrollins do they get a discount as well?
oditorium	708935741376741376	2016-03-13T08:40:26	AbeLolisted cobrollins moot point in this context: how does he bring the money in? reporting restrictions are what, $10,000?
oditorium	708935155029827584	2016-03-13T08:38:06	cobrollins AbeLolisted per day I suppose; nice little racket given that all cash transactions &gt; â¬1000 are reportable

oditorium	708933419212906496	2016-03-13T08:31:13	AbeLolisted cobrollins that's the other point: â¬100,000 in â¬50's is 1-2 blocks of photocopier paper--manageable if you really want to
oditorium	708932208547991552	2016-03-13T08:26:24	AbeLolisted cobrollins but so we do all agree that the main benefit of normal people having access to â¬500 notes is tax evasion, right?
oditorium	708931898161143812	2016-03-13T08:25:10	AbeLolisted cobrollins good point--and for those clearly having â¬500 vs â¬50 notes makes a bit of difference in terms of cost of carry

oditorium	708926061355126784	2016-03-13T08:01:58	AbeLolisted my point--the main benefit of cash in this case is to enable tax evasion

oditorium	708924577750106112	2016-03-13T07:56:05	AbeLolisted it used to be thoug that people would get high denom notes from the bank to take them immediately to the (car) dealer

oditorium	708684521361829888	2016-03-12T16:02:11	mcwm agreed--but the analysis is much more front loaded nowadays; not criticising the article by the way, it is a good one
oditorium	708684023703478272	2016-03-12T16:00:12	mcwm so any publication with a week-long news cycle is archaic--it is very difficult to bring a new angle after "so much time"
oditorium	708683710825172992	2016-03-12T15:58:58	mcwm but my point was really that Twitter gives you this instant access to info that even good analysis looks stale after a day or two

oditorium	708308571231031296	2016-03-11T15:08:17	MayfairCynic but my knowledge predates 2010--you keep referring to maternity by the way: is it legal to discriminate bc of paternity?

oditorium	708302726963306496	2016-03-11T14:45:04	LadyFOHF duncanrobinson which is probably legal now by the way because discrimination bc of parental leave no longer sex discrimination

oditorium	706774767131627520	2016-03-07T09:33:30	rebeccawire Jeffrey_Black I slightly object to the word 'racism'--this is about foreigners, regardless of race
oditorium	706772770370277376	2016-03-07T09:25:34	rebeccawire Jeffrey_Black this is why AfD can gain votes: if the CDU like the Tories would allow for that position they'd vote CDU
oditorium	706772455990435840	2016-03-07T09:24:19	rebeccawire Jeffrey_Black absolutely; but this has become pretty mainstream all over Europe now, with even Boris being on that bandwagon

oditorium	706770743158300673	2016-03-07T09:17:30	Jeffrey_Black I think you got this wrong; 'bunt' is much wider than 'race'--it is everything that is not conform with Germany in the 50's
oditorium	706770417520943104	2016-03-07T09:16:13	Jeffrey_Black in conclusion, AfD seems actually closer to UKIP and Brexit crowd within Tories than it is to Die Rechte jeuasommenulle
oditorium	706769953643491328	2016-03-07T09:14:22	Jeffrey_Black in fact, it seems that as long as people are 'well-integrated' race is not an issue 
oditorium	706769713427255296	2016-03-07T09:13:25	Jeffrey_Black the AfD's position is more one of taking Germany back to the 50's than a racist position
oditorium	706769497991069696	2016-03-07T09:12:34	Jeffrey_Black in German politics, the word 'bunt' is more used in conjunction with alternative lifestyles (eg LGBT), multi-culturalism etc
oditorium	706769111699873792	2016-03-07T09:11:02	Jeffrey_Black and there is no association of color with people of say Asian or Arabic descent
oditorium	706768946146500608	2016-03-07T09:10:22	Jeffrey_Black ..but this was more American, and the most common word is still 'schwarz'; note that this _only_ refers to black people...
oditorium	706768714419576832	2016-03-07T09:09:27	Jeffrey_Black 1/ the word "bunt" in German has very little racial connotation; we used to use 'farbig' for black people a long time ago...

oditorium	706758745225863173	2016-03-07T08:29:50	Jeffrey_Black jeuasommenulle of course; this is what AfD stands for, they are not making a secret out of it
oditorium	706758375913218048	2016-03-07T08:28:22	Jeffrey_Black jeuasommenulle and "bunt" is actually not quite "colorful", the emphasis of bunt is the mixing of colours
oditorium	706757858889752576	2016-03-07T08:26:19	Jeffrey_Black jeuasommenulle point is: given that you know that anyway, this pun actually isnt too bad if you understand German well

oditorium	703615711529271297	2016-02-27T16:20:32	kitjuckes Zettel314 on the other hand, if you consider property say a 30-50y duration asset in rising interest rates...
oditorium	703615536995942403	2016-02-27T16:19:51	kitjuckes Zettel314 but yeah, rental yield still looks reasonably attractive against zero'ish interest rates

oditorium	703611702936477696	2016-02-27T16:04:37	Zettel314 I agree--affordability is a big issue, and of course the solution there is not subsidies, but building houses
oditorium	703611324861956096	2016-02-27T16:03:06	Zettel314 also keep in mind current rate levels--income multiple might look sanguine, but notional multiples dont

oditorium	703198960572194816	2016-02-26T12:44:31	EdConwaySky M_C_Klein if you accept the 'London West' (at 172000 GDP/capita) is nonsense you'll get a reasonable 200% for London overall
oditorium	703198709635416064	2016-02-26T12:43:31	EdConwaySky M_C_Klein sure, but this means the data actually does not support the 'regional inequality' point

oditorium	703195708623495168	2016-02-26T12:31:36	M_C_Klein EdConwaySky for example, you might end up allocation all the GDP to region of corp headquarter, not the other locations
oditorium	703195512522936321	2016-02-26T12:30:49	M_C_Klein EdConwaySky also, the smaller the region the more arbitrary your definition of regional GDP becomes

oditorium	698840279797915648	2016-02-14T12:04:41	kentindell as you dont know when you prepared that block whether or not the old one was voted valid you cant include its hash
oditorium	698840076575498241	2016-02-14T12:03:52	kentindell I think the issue is that they want the new block ready and waiting fully hashed by the time the voting on the old one is done

oditorium	698454565226704896	2016-02-13T10:31:59	GreekAnalyst migrants won't travel on Greek passports so even if they take the plane they'll be in the other queue, like Americans
oditorium	698453050286067712	2016-02-13T10:25:58	GreekAnalyst I mean they might bc of all the crap news coverage, but not because of Schengen; Schengen is about borders, not people
oditorium	698452822015262720	2016-02-13T10:25:04	GreekAnalyst why would they? why does a German border guard care about looking at a Greek, UK, or German passport?
oditorium	698451517645418496	2016-02-13T10:19:53	GreekAnalyst ..main arrivals area with passport controls, and Greek citizens will use the same EU queue as Germans, Brits arriving there
oditorium	698451243707060224	2016-02-13T10:18:47	GreekAnalyst do you really think say Frankfurt Airport will create an 'arriving from Greece' area? Like UK flights, they'll arrive in the..
oditorium	698450875858157568	2016-02-13T10:17:20	GreekAnalyst seriously, Schengen is not about passports, it is about from where the planes come
oditorium	698450587298500608	2016-02-13T10:16:11	GreekAnalyst not really; there won't be a 'coming from Greece' queue; they will go through same queue as those arriving from UK
oditorium	698450300173185024	2016-02-13T10:15:02	GreekAnalyst if Greek trucks are deemed at higher risk of transporting refugees then there will be increased controls, Schengen or not
oditorium	698450050247213057	2016-02-13T10:14:03	GreekAnalyst key criterium here EU membership, not Schengen; EU citizens (incl UK) use same queues when they cross non-Schengen borders
oditorium	698449676668948480	2016-02-13T10:12:34	GreekAnalyst Schengen is about WHICH border crossings are controlled, not about WHO is controlled at certain borders
oditorium	698449123251523584	2016-02-13T10:10:22	GreekAnalyst ...but this is independent of Greece being part of Schengen or not; those are non-Schengen borders
oditorium	698448953088602112	2016-02-13T10:09:41	GreekAnalyst the trucks will only be stopped at non-Schengen borders; there might be heavier controls there than before...
oditorium	698448435012358144	2016-02-13T10:07:38	GreekAnalyst the only real difference is for air travellers (and possibly air cargo)
oditorium	698448223686492160	2016-02-13T10:06:47	GreekAnalyst being part of Schengen does not confer any privileges on the relevant passport holders / resident companies
oditorium	698447991846387712	2016-02-13T10:05:52	GreekAnalyst exactly; but there is zero impact of Greece being part of Schengen or not on this truck
oditorium	698447307763752960	2016-02-13T10:03:09	GreekAnalyst as for stigma - UK is outside Schengen as well, and it really only matters marginally
oditorium	698447095745929216	2016-02-13T10:02:18	GreekAnalyst because of transit times at the border; but Greece does not have any land borders with Schengen anyway, so why does it matter?
oditorium	698446952971821056	2016-02-13T10:01:44	GreekAnalyst as for business, I also don't get it; suspending Schengen between France and Germany is catastrophe for business
oditorium	698446801247039488	2016-02-13T10:01:08	GreekAnalyst how? I travel often from the UK and within Schengen by plane an quite frankly, the difference is marginal
oditorium	698445850826113024	2016-02-13T09:57:21	GreekAnalyst FT does Schengen matter for Greece? flights from Greece will go to the same gates as flights from the UK, but what else?

oditorium	697823354938642432	2016-02-11T16:43:47	No it isn't. 
oditorium	697824327258005507	2016-02-11T16:47:39	dsquareddigest kentindell you then have an infrastructure on top of which you can build the application layer
oditorium	697824202120941568	2016-02-11T16:47:09	dsquareddigest kentindell then you could have one or more entities run it under an SLA and watch that basket
oditorium	697823963070779393	2016-02-11T16:46:12	dsquareddigest kentindell I really dont buy it though; with a state actor involved you could come up with a sensible policy

oditorium	697822782332264448	2016-02-11T16:41:30	kentindell now that is an interesting angle I havemt heard before... want to elaborate
oditorium	697815736790753280	2016-02-11T16:13:31	oditorium I think private blockchains come down to a bet: that TCO is cheaper than wth a centralised entity because of legal costs.

oditorium	697822039390945280	2016-02-11T16:38:33	kentindell we should talk... did I send you my full presentation?
oditorium	697815704792383488	2016-02-11T16:13:23	kentindell you should really read my article - it is only 10 pages :-)
oditorium	697815582079651840	2016-02-11T16:12:54	kentindell in a centralised system on the other hand you can run corrections as you see fit...
oditorium	697815487636439041	2016-02-11T16:12:31	kentindell exactly - but because it is a complex system what you want ex-ante it not necessarily what you get ex-post (I wrote about this)
oditorium	697814989294411776	2016-02-11T16:10:32	kentindell well, no; you write good policy, and you regulate it as the public utility it is
oditorium	697814700957003776	2016-02-11T16:09:24	kentindell on the other hand, if the Chinese miners to collude against certain transaction, how will you make them stop?
oditorium	697814579963957248	2016-02-11T16:08:55	kentindell secondly, a generic crypto chain is a commodity; you dont like one, you can just go to another one
oditorium	697814437697318913	2016-02-11T16:08:21	kentindell works much better in centralised system in my views; firstly you can set policy, and enforce policy using courts / regulators
oditorium	697813966320492546	2016-02-11T16:06:28	kentindell and sometimes you want government to be able to seize assets, of 'baddies' as my daughter calls them
oditorium	697813790755307520	2016-02-11T16:05:47	kentindell that government cant seize your assets, granted. but in most countries governments cant do that anyway
oditorium	697813609393553408	2016-02-11T16:05:03	kentindell like what?
oditorium	697813476304093184	2016-02-11T16:04:32	kentindell if you acknowledge that there is something like a legal system that kinda works, your governance model becomes easier
oditorium	697813243054706688	2016-02-11T16:03:36	kentindell wrote about this as well - we wanted 1 million private miners, we got 10 Chinese conglomerates
oditorium	697813022786613249	2016-02-11T16:02:44	kentindell eg Everledger in my view should be run on a centralised chain - Blockchain is overkill (except to get funding of course)
oditorium	697812803378421760	2016-02-11T16:01:51	kentindell no, it is just a crypto chain, which means you can implement governance that makes it tamper proof
oditorium	697812294282174465	2016-02-11T15:59:50	kentindell and provided you have the right APIs in place you can ascertain data consistency based on the hash
oditorium	697812152879603712	2016-02-11T15:59:16	kentindell if you are running a replication into other data centres you'll be certain that after a few seconds everything is backed up
oditorium	697811958037409793	2016-02-11T15:58:30	kentindell I also wrote about that: you arent; firstly you wait at least 10 minutes, and secondly your block might still disappear
oditorium	697811738801078272	2016-02-11T15:57:37	kentindell that's the last section; IMO you can create a lot of fault tolerance by replicating a database into other data centres

oditorium	695021038577541120	2016-02-03T23:08:23	izakaminska of course customers tend to be suckers for rates and leave you for 10bp, which is where this model breaks down
oditorium	695020861556969472	2016-02-03T23:07:40	izakaminska which is not a bad strategy if you think you have a competitive advantage raising deposits by providing customer service

oditorium	695019384578957312	2016-02-03T23:01:48	izakaminska the large majority of all ABS were RMBS, out of those the majority was AAA, and there majority floating

oditorium	695017446273589248	2016-02-03T22:54:06	izakaminska true, but banks can't afford to buy sovg bonds with their excess deposits - negative carry
oditorium	695016907511095300	2016-02-03T22:51:58	izakaminska in fact, customers can often choose whether they want fixed or floating, and the issue is adjusted accordingly

oditorium	695014936574103554	2016-02-03T22:44:08	izakaminska and a pedantic point: the IR sensitivity point the author is making is probably moot as the bonds should be floating

oditorium	693389947164844032	2016-01-30T11:07:00	prestonjbyrne jasonlk pmarca of course I agree you should not have a design shop making each an every of your presentations
oditorium	693389814650048512	2016-01-30T11:06:29	prestonjbyrne jasonlk pmarca if you only deal with VCs that don't value nice decks then you don't need nice decks; kinda tautological
oditorium	693389433819766784	2016-01-30T11:04:58	prestonjbyrne jasonlk so now you need two decks - the amateur design for pmarca, and the slick one for others
oditorium	693389176528617473	2016-01-30T11:03:56	prestonjbyrne jasonlk I guess it depends on whom you are targeting, and I am not sure all VCs out there are like pmarca

oditorium	692730518509584384	2016-01-28T15:26:40	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola like a book: every single sentence is subject to copyright, but only quoting one sentence is prob fair use
oditorium	692729375528198144	2016-01-28T15:22:08	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola only consistent view is that (a) all tweets are protected, but (b) single tweets might be subject to fair use
oditorium	692729215687495680	2016-01-28T15:21:29	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola can not be protected, and you said before that you'd be infringing when you copy more tweets
oditorium	692729013312299008	2016-01-28T15:20:41	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola but your logic does not work: if every single tweet is not protected then by definition a set of tweets...

oditorium	692727917877596161	2016-01-28T15:16:20	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola which seems to be exactly the fair use point I was making: all tweets are copyrighted,...
oditorium	692727255584391169	2016-01-28T15:13:42	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola this certainly does not include the license of third parties to screencap the tweet onto their blog
oditorium	692726993109028864	2016-01-28T15:12:40	rmacanthony well, the license is easy: none, unless Frances_Coppola explicitly grants it 
oditorium	692725423214583808	2016-01-28T15:06:25	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola so you are really saying that I can just steal all of Marc's storms unless he registers them?
oditorium	692725076257538048	2016-01-28T15:05:03	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola if you RT it with a comment your comment remains, but the link in the tweet goes to a 404 page
oditorium	692724972041695233	2016-01-28T15:04:38	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola no, if you new-style RT a tweet without a comment then this RT disappears when tweet deleted
oditorium	692722985308913665	2016-01-28T14:56:44	Frances_Coppola rmacanthony and whilst we are at it, why not the Wall Street Journal? Do they register everything?
oditorium	692722777825099777	2016-01-28T14:55:55	Frances_Coppola and of course then I sell rmacanthony's blog posts assuming that he does not register everything he writes :-)

oditorium	692721115102330880	2016-01-28T14:49:18	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola 2nd tweet, granted; if you limit your analysis to US law why dont you state that for benefit of intl audience?
oditorium	692718819052294144	2016-01-28T14:40:11	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola pray tell where in the story you mention that your legal analysis applies to the US only?
oditorium	692717991495110656	2016-01-28T14:36:53	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola but that Twitter mandates that all inter-user disputes are handled in the US seems unlikely to me
oditorium	692717575864741888	2016-01-28T14:35:14	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola to be clear: if I am suing twitter I might agree to do so in the US (even though this might be void in the EU)
oditorium	692717447737131009	2016-01-28T14:34:44	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola if I have a beef with another twitter user I am agreeing to US law? show me that provision
oditorium	692717195214917632	2016-01-28T14:33:44	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola and as Frances is in the UK and a lot of her trolls are in the UK, why do I care about US law?
oditorium	692717069243146240	2016-01-28T14:33:14	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola we are not talking about US, we are talking about copyright which is a worldwide concept
oditorium	692716377099104258	2016-01-28T14:30:29	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola and of course registration is not necessary for a DMCA notice 
oditorium	692715937867366400	2016-01-28T14:28:44	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola seriously, why do you US guys always assume your law is all that matters? 
oditorium	692715344092340224	2016-01-28T14:26:22	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola to be clear: there is a world outside the US; how do you register copyright in the UK pray tell?
oditorium	692714268471463936	2016-01-28T14:22:06	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola you dont have to register - you can directly sue for infringement, or issue a DMCA takedown notice
oditorium	692713994403106816	2016-01-28T14:21:00	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola the real question is whether you can usually assume that using a single tweet constitutes 'fair use'
oditorium	692713573966090244	2016-01-28T14:19:20	rmacanthony Frances_Coppola you dont need to register copyright thats not a trademark, you just have it; and tweets are certainly covered

oditorium	692475535952338945	2016-01-27T22:33:28	Frances_Coppola rmacanthony but if someone copies your tweets you can almost certainly send a DMCA takedown notice to their ISP
oditorium	692475003389001732	2016-01-27T22:31:21	Frances_Coppola rmacanthony it wont be - ultimately fair use is very specific of both circumstances and jurisdiction

oditorium	692473775007358977	2016-01-27T22:26:28	Frances_Coppola rmacanthony as for RT vs screenshot: the point is that RTs actually disappear when you delete a tweet
