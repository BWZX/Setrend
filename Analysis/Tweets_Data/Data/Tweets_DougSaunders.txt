DougSaunders	723473426732589057	2016-04-22T11:28:01	craigxmartin Exactly my point. Voting for"citizens of Canada" is a minimum; should be all residents, like other rights. Vote where you live
DougSaunders	723473051786964992	2016-04-22T11:26:31	dave_munroe Exactly the problem. It's why Toronto passed law to extend voting to non-citizen residents. Canada should, as UK does
DougSaunders	723472757783064576	2016-04-22T11:25:21	video_link Better approach to extend voting to everyone living in Canada. Basic ethics: you vote where you live

DougSaunders	721418195656048641	2016-04-16T19:21:15	SteveDaly15 EmmMacfarlane Anyway, Star Trek is sci-fi, which is safe because it's literature. Even Avatar technically is, though yuck
DougSaunders	721417977774632960	2016-04-16T19:20:23	SteveDaly15 EmmMacfarlane There is no way anyone in the world would want to see a sequel to Avatar. That will surely do some damage

DougSaunders	721415606331916288	2016-04-16T19:10:58	Westerns fell fast: 25% of movies in 1960; 12% in 1972, only 4 in 1973, 2 in 1974. Three between 1979 &amp; 1984. Volume fatigue
DougSaunders	721414189181505536	2016-04-16T19:05:20	And the cause of that revulsion will be volume: 6 Marvel, 4 DC, ~1 Star Wars movies per year (yeah they're part of the genre). Tightskrieg.
DougSaunders	721413661701627904	2016-04-16T19:03:14	But the "pure" genre's death will have same cause as death of westerns: a mass fatigue and public distaste with the concept of heroism
DougSaunders	721413484412542976	2016-04-16T19:02:32	It should be noted that this post-superhero subgenre may have huge successes, much as Blazing Saddles was the highest-grossing western ever

DougSaunders	719185272898859009	2016-04-10T15:28:25	jenprittie Affordable is always a relative thing. And increasing supply of rental stock helps the whole market
DougSaunders	719185008364097536	2016-04-10T15:27:22	InjuredThales And (2) Increasing the supply of rental housing is not going to drive the rates up; quite the opposite
DougSaunders	719184877707374592	2016-04-10T15:26:51	InjuredThales They definitely are doing the former -- vacancy rate is no higher than in cities without foreign ownership.

DougSaunders	718903796777091072	2016-04-09T20:49:56	Since Vancouver's vacant-home rate is under 5%, it seems absentee ownership *is* helping affordable-housing supply

DougSaunders	717381577097891842	2016-04-05T16:01:10	MarkSchatzker I enjoy your reporting there. But a) why should transformative cooking be a "lie" and plain ingredients be "true" -- and
DougSaunders	717373910501601280	2016-04-05T15:30:43	These 2 grafs by Martin Wolf explain well why much more expensive action is needed on carbon  
DougSaunders	717366360502710272	2016-04-05T15:00:43	MarkSchatzker Fat, salt and MSG (other name: umami) are the cornerstones of all great cooking. Have been for hundreds of years
DougSaunders	717366083737427968	2016-04-05T14:59:37	MarkSchatzker Single most damaging thing in recipes today is myth that expensive/organic ingredients are required. Why people don't cook
DougSaunders	717365117155823618	2016-04-05T14:55:46	MarkSchatzker I'd say buy a plain supermarket chicken, use a lot of concentrated stock, salt, cream, multiple cooking methods, transform it
DougSaunders	717364764544868353	2016-04-05T14:54:22	MarkSchatzker With a very few things, i.e. plain steak, a better raw ingredient matters. But people harmfully universalize this
DougSaunders	717364515751337988	2016-04-05T14:53:23	MarkSchatzker I'm all for processing - it's what the best chefs do. Too many recipes today are underseasoned, too few steps, lacking sauces
DougSaunders	717363916817305600	2016-04-05T14:51:00	MarkSchatzker You don't need superior food to do superior cooking. Recipe demand for meaningless "organic" ingredients limits food to elite
DougSaunders	717363223838654464	2016-04-05T14:48:15	MarkSchatzker The solution is not more expensive ingredients but best principles of cooking: Concentration, seasoning, modification
DougSaunders	717362941117399041	2016-04-05T14:47:07	MarkSchatzker It's a good subject, but I wouldn't want consumers to think regular supermarket ingredients = inferior food as a result

DougSaunders	717352532922642432	2016-04-05T14:05:46	amberinzaman So to prevent people from backing what he sees as a national secessionist movement, he gives them another nationality?
DougSaunders	717352372863774720	2016-04-05T14:05:08	Ok, I can see a couple flaws in this plan

DougSaunders	717335971734269952	2016-04-05T12:59:57	fortpapalia (In food, as in almost all things, authenticity is the enemy of nourishment, pleasure and humanity)

DougSaunders	717335654284156930	2016-04-05T12:58:42	fortpapalia Sauces are a crucial enhancement. As Escoffier noted, they apply human refinement to the raw materials of nature.
DougSaunders	717333919884922880	2016-04-05T12:51:48	fortpapalia Yes, taste of food has improved really dramatically, it's true. Fortunately we're no longer stuck with "supposed to taste"

DougSaunders	714143868632043520	2016-03-27T17:35:41	Burton4Freedom (Keep in mind 6 million people migrate to Europe in any normal year. Refugee numbers too small to affect demographics)
DougSaunders	714143628222967811	2016-03-27T17:34:43	Burton4Freedom "Faces" is an extrapolation; not there yet. And still not all that large
DougSaunders	714135907624988672	2016-03-27T17:04:03	Burton4Freedom The refugee crisis of the '90s was larger, and yes most of them were Muslim.  Big controversy then; no effects of course
DougSaunders	714129424468283393	2016-03-27T16:38:17	Burton4Freedom Yes.  The much larger refugee flood of the 1990s didn't produce either.These phenomena are not causally related to migration

DougSaunders	713837610351923202	2016-03-26T21:18:43	kaarlman michaelbolton Intermarriage too, but you get groups, like Orthodox Jews, who don't do it but are highly integrated in other ways
DougSaunders	713837466399145984	2016-03-26T21:18:09	kaarlman michaelbolton But tolerance indicators are good measures -- why I think homosexuality / working women attitudes are key measures

DougSaunders	712970300011462656	2016-03-24T11:52:20	Lyderhorn73 Actually, they are generally raised by secular parents and many from non-Muslim families. Parents shocked. It's a cult.

DougSaunders	707686607982231552	2016-03-09T21:56:50	@SemperResurgo True, and at least one might require a *lower* carbon price to harmonize with fed target
DougSaunders	707684866553327616	2016-03-09T21:49:54	@SemperResurgo Though at some point you need to ask what that good relationship is for.

DougSaunders	707675725688537088	2016-03-09T21:13:35	It would still be left to provinces. They can have fed price, or their price and no fed funding for anything  
DougSaunders	707675312784453632	2016-03-09T21:11:57	Maybe that sounds politically naive, but it *is* how you make things national that the constitution otherwise leaves to provinces

DougSaunders	706876856381865984	2016-03-07T16:19:10	bruce_arthur The whole problem is they used it for an everyday missing-persons case. There are 130 of those per year.

DougSaunders	706875244758372353	2016-03-07T16:12:46	bruce_arthur  Basic problem: if you treat every local missing-persons case as an immediate threat to entire province, soon nothing is

DougSaunders	706871476859711488	2016-03-07T15:57:47	Westicles A lot more people have cellphones than have cable TV, and they're not using SMS. Those people can actually act on info

DougSaunders	706869872920104960	2016-03-07T15:51:25	mssinenomine The alert *should be* about police's need for actionable information as fast as possible. That goal is defeated with this

DougSaunders	706867018415415297	2016-03-07T15:40:04	mssinenomine If it had been an actual major crime, the grotesque mistake of using this air-raid system would have been much more evident

DougSaunders	706828561521348609	2016-03-07T13:07:15	DaveSlack_ I think the social media component of this was well done.  But the cable-TV idea was political "let's do everything" gesturing
DougSaunders	706828123577319426	2016-03-07T13:05:31	DaveSlack_ That's what this did (if it had been an actual crime). Mass SMS allows you to reach the specific people who could have info
DougSaunders	706827741492940800	2016-03-07T13:04:00	DaveSlack_ but to use this air-raid method for a localized amber alert defeats the quick-information goal of the system
DougSaunders	706826855756640256	2016-03-07T13:00:29	DaveSlack_ TV blasts have their place - for reaching people in immanent danger ie an armed person nearby or weather emergency approaching
DougSaunders	706826514432532480	2016-03-07T12:59:07	DaveSlack_ In most countries, mass text message (SMS) is used for this. It teaches the people who will know things, can respond instantly
DougSaunders	706826216754380800	2016-03-07T12:57:56	DaveSlack_ The goal is not to tell people "something happened in a faraway city." It's to get info police need, fast, from many people.

DougSaunders	706825078063779840	2016-03-07T12:53:25	DaveSlack_ Instead of doubling down on this failure, why don't you think about how an info system might work. Hint- it does elsewhere.
DougSaunders	706824864779210754	2016-03-07T12:52:34	DaveSlack_ We've just seen a vivid demonstration of how the Canadian system fails at anything other than self-promotion.
DougSaunders	706824354152062976	2016-03-07T12:50:32	DaveSlack_ Again: having unused appliances make noise is *the opposite* of a police information system that works.
DougSaunders	706824098194661377	2016-03-07T12:49:31	DaveSlack_ Who was watching TV? And if it's time sensitive, a province-wide air-raid siren is the opposite of effective. It is a failure
DougSaunders	706823056367300608	2016-03-07T12:45:23	DaveSlack_ Most other countries have alert systems that work. Using cable TV this way, and not mass SMS,  sets it back 5 decades
DougSaunders	706822369352949760	2016-03-07T12:42:39	DaveSlack_ Everyone with children should be asking that they shut down this self-defeating piece of promotional technology

DougSaunders	706819447974031361	2016-03-07T12:31:03	DaveSlack_  Who said it interfered with a debate? Having unused appliances scream about a false alarm was the problem
DougSaunders	706817919569670144	2016-03-07T12:24:58	mssinenomine Again: a successful alert system needs to convey actionable info about relevant incidents. This defeats its own ambitions
DougSaunders	706817156361551872	2016-03-07T12:21:56	mssinenomine It means they are generally not something requiring the entire province to be alerted. We want alert systems to work.
DougSaunders	706721922583756800	2016-03-07T06:03:31	mssinenomine Spousal abuse is always a crime. But missing-persons cases are generally not serial killers or stranger abductions.
DougSaunders	706721615921483776	2016-03-07T06:02:18	mssinenomine If a child is missing, it may be a crime or something else. Mobilizing the entire province needs to be saved for rare things
DougSaunders	706714773195329537	2016-03-07T05:35:06	mssinenomine Again: the only time you want to make appliances squawk is when those specific people are in actual danger at that moment
DougSaunders	706713198691426304	2016-03-07T05:28:51	mssinenomine No, if you treat every crime as "breaking news," then it dulls attention. Save it for times when "Act now" has meaning.
DougSaunders	706712758859878401	2016-03-07T05:27:06	mssinenomine Yes, my friend Stevie Cameron edited that magazine and wrote that article. Though she was focusing on murder cases not MMIW
DougSaunders	706711585369161728	2016-03-07T05:22:26	mssinenomine If we put every missing-person case on the front page, do you think that would raise interest in such cases, or the contrary?

DougSaunders	706710273759903744	2016-03-07T05:17:13	mssinenomine Not at all. But a technology that screams at people "we're doing something!" rather than one that does something is a problem
DougSaunders	706709705117143040	2016-03-07T05:14:58	geoffreyroche My point is the Alert Ready system is itself bad, empty, self-promoting policing. We just saw that illustrated abundantly.
DougSaunders	706709181932269569	2016-03-07T05:12:53	mssinenomine I don't see any protection in this system. I see police self-promotion while ignoring technologies that could actually help
DougSaunders	706707266435584000	2016-03-07T05:05:16	msopee LateNightCam This would be an enormously ineffective way to get such help -as we just saw-  so I'd be quite angry they did it.
DougSaunders	706706962772156421	2016-03-07T05:04:04	geoffreyroche I can see a use for this TV technology. But it's "you're in danger, act now" -- not "we're fishing for info on maybe a crime"
DougSaunders	706706630340050944	2016-03-07T05:02:45	mssinenomine But "we're looking for any information on something that might be a crime somewhere" seems a technological mismatch
DougSaunders	706706476975263744	2016-03-07T05:02:08	mssinenomine i.e. if there's an armed person in your vicinity, you might want to lock doors and get kids out of the park.
DougSaunders	706706337816645632	2016-03-07T05:01:35	mssinenomine I understand your feeling. I'd think this should be saved for instances where you need to tell people "do something now."
DougSaunders	706706038477590528	2016-03-07T05:00:24	geoffreyroche I'm less complacent about bad policing -- and this is an A1 example of that.
DougSaunders	706705317837471744	2016-03-07T04:57:32	mssinenomine If you make everyone's appliances squawk for every one of those, how effective will the system be at getting quick info?
DougSaunders	706705127961284608	2016-03-07T04:56:47	mssinenomine There are ~130 cases like this per year in Canada, almost all of them either family feuds or false alarms (like this one)
DougSaunders	706704756886999041	2016-03-07T04:55:18	geoffreyroche And we could have a system that actually works, like many countries do. Air-raid sirens are not crowdsourcing;opposite effect
DougSaunders	706703755270434816	2016-03-07T04:51:19	geoffreyroche You'd be embarrassed, as your false alarm just showed the weakness of a system designed for politics, not effective policing
DougSaunders	706703162116210688	2016-03-07T04:48:58	mssinenomine People in *Windsor* tell me they got that one. If people are to take things seriously, they need to be relevant to their area
DougSaunders	706702898860675072	2016-03-07T04:47:55	mssinenomine Most countries send an SMS to everyone -so all phones get a text message. Way more penetration than cable, actionable audience
DougSaunders	706702622237962240	2016-03-07T04:46:49	mssinenomine If an information-addicted person like me responded by scrambling to shut off system, it's not a way to reach people with info
DougSaunders	706702228816420865	2016-03-07T04:45:15	geoffreyroche And tonight was a very good illustration of that system's failure -- taught 10 million people to ignore the squawk
DougSaunders	706702027733098496	2016-03-07T04:44:27	geoffreyroche Rather than developing a system to crowdsource quickly, they said "let's set off a siren." Cleans their hands without working
DougSaunders	706701772727791620	2016-03-07T04:43:27	geoffreyroche This has the same effect as a newspaper ad. It's designed to assuage politicians, not to get quick actionable information.
DougSaunders	706700703364833284	2016-03-07T04:39:12	mssinenomine This is a way to tell politicians and public "we did everything." It is not a way to get information. Mass SMS would be.
DougSaunders	706700064572313600	2016-03-07T04:36:39	mssinenomine This satisfies the "we did everything" impulse. Instead, how about "we did the most effective things to get info quickly"
DougSaunders	706696598961524736	2016-03-07T04:22:53	mssinenomine elle_v__ Imagine if we did what other places do, and send mass SMS (which everyone has). This is like an air-raid siren
DougSaunders	706696382048931840	2016-03-07T04:22:01	markhoffberg I wasn't watching a show. It was an unused TV in a distant room. And I've disabled the service; I'll share how to.
DougSaunders	706696181569556480	2016-03-07T04:21:14	robertwakulat And we just did!
DougSaunders	706696118332067841	2016-03-07T04:20:59	markhoffberg It was a perfect example of the "do anything" approach -- bad use of old technology in which the large defeats the good.
DougSaunders	706695553514483712	2016-03-07T04:18:44	mssinenomine elle_v__ Exactly. This is a way to prevent the latter from occurring -- other states/countries have developed effective tech
DougSaunders	706694467672154112	2016-03-07T04:14:25	elle_v__ The fact that this air-raid approach is a failure. Crowdsourcing does not mean "everyone panic," it means gather actionable info.
DougSaunders	706693828237918211	2016-03-07T04:11:53	elle_v__ DDublover34 Exactly. Their first experience is a false alarm. Why not use modern tech to sperad real information not alarm?
DougSaunders	706693089075695616	2016-03-07T04:08:56	geoffreyroche Anyone who has kids shold be embarrassed by this obsolete ham-fisted technology, which just taught everyone to ignore it.
DougSaunders	706692848138096640	2016-03-07T04:07:59	DDublover34 elle_v__ It was. So people have now learned to ignore this. Instead, police could use SMS etc in a way that works
DougSaunders	706691922555875329	2016-03-07T04:04:18	geoffreyroche JPBoutros Then I'd be very embarrassed that this false alarm just discredited an ill-designed system
DougSaunders	706691663796670464	2016-03-07T04:03:17	DaveJMedia neilstaite dcaporicci  No, getting it out to the most effective people does. This false alarm has just discredited the system
DougSaunders	706691492933337091	2016-03-07T04:02:36	elle_v__ The fact that this was a false alarm illustrates the problem of this obsolete approach: Crowdsourcing works. Alarm bells don't.
DougSaunders	706690646925402113	2016-03-07T03:59:14	boatical @mckjor If your aim is to get actionable information from an informed part of public, the sledgehammer appraoch doesn't work
DougSaunders	706690001866612736	2016-03-07T03:56:40	I'm all for crowdsourcing of major crimes. Mass texts! Social media! But 1965-era "make unused appliances scream" defeats the whole point
DougSaunders	706689782806482945	2016-03-07T03:55:48	neilstaite dcaporicci dougsaunders That's the way to do it. Not this.
DougSaunders	706689698886864896	2016-03-07T03:55:28	dcaporicci Mass SMS, texts, social media -- good approaches. Antiquated cable-TV squawks undo all that good.
DougSaunders	706689541898264576	2016-03-07T03:54:51	boatical @mckjor I'm all for crowdsourcing major crime. Texts. Social media. But this sets it back decades &amp; contradicts aims
DougSaunders	706687257235869696	2016-03-07T03:45:46	dcaporicci Getting the word out about a grave crime is important. This would have been a good way to do it in 1965
DougSaunders	706685930975989760	2016-03-07T03:40:30	dcaporicci Let's do things that actually help. This is a poor use of technology that achieves the opposite of the desired effect
DougSaunders	706685194955333632	2016-03-07T03:37:34	boatical @mckjor A local crime  in a city 2 hours away does not need to make appliances I'm not even using scream at me.
DougSaunders	706684443654791168	2016-03-07T03:34:35	dcaporicci In some distant city. I follow local crime closely enough that I don't need my appliances waking everyone up
DougSaunders	706684184463597568	2016-03-07T03:33:33	TotenCan Yes, but that does not prevent these things from appearing in the first place.
DougSaunders	706682106144038912	2016-03-07T03:25:18	dcaporicci Yes, but the setting to prevent these alerts from occurring is three menus deep
DougSaunders	706681879307669504	2016-03-07T03:24:24	@mckjor Which is a type of police alert. And how does one disable this service?

DougSaunders	706680272784396290	2016-03-07T03:18:01	Ok how do you disable police alerts on your TV? They just blasted a klaxon through my house for some crime in a city 2 hours away

DougSaunders	702199512396206080	2016-02-23T18:33:04	pipskipple If it could be shown that this would increase ridership/revenue, then it might be worth doing. Some cities do this.

DougSaunders	702195604672237568	2016-02-23T18:17:32	pipskipple Yeah, I think the $6 fare to Weston is going to be a big advantage in this direction (until Smartrail materializes)

DougSaunders	702191772391182336	2016-02-23T18:02:19	dayofthemutant Not true- - they were during the industrial age. Immigration today tends to raise wages and incomes.
DougSaunders	702191393599426561	2016-02-23T18:00:48	dayofthemutant I'm not sure where you live, but the Netherlands is a very nice place to live, in large part because it's so populated
DougSaunders	702190562804281344	2016-02-23T17:57:30	dayofthemutant Immigrants aren't "cheap labour." They create economies and employment; most great businesses are immigrant-launched
DougSaunders	702190351163850757	2016-02-23T17:56:40	dayofthemutant Here's my essay on the importance of Canada tripling its population: 
DougSaunders	702190158745985024	2016-02-23T17:55:54	MTHE_1 Today it's more exception than rule.
DougSaunders	702189980051877889	2016-02-23T17:55:11	dayofthemutant We could *live.* Just a far lower standard of living, more poverty, infant mortality etc, and more damage to the environment
DougSaunders	702189631324827648	2016-02-23T17:53:48	dayofthemutant Not necessarily high. Just commensurate to geography. Problem is that humans don't have a steady-state population
DougSaunders	702189355243163648	2016-02-23T17:52:42	dayofthemutant Population decline increases poverty, badly limits resources you have to do beneficial things such as climate etc.
DougSaunders	702189146828242944	2016-02-23T17:51:53	dayofthemutant No, not enough population density in those countries to support robust institutions. Including ecological regimes!
DougSaunders	702188761149378560	2016-02-23T17:50:21	dayofthemutant Others, i.e. most Europe, Turkey, Iran, China face shrinking populations so are dealing with that looming economic disaster
DougSaunders	702188426611675136	2016-02-23T17:49:01	dayofthemutant It really varies. Some countries (Canada, Australia) are badly underpopulated and need a lot more people.
DougSaunders	702188094162731008	2016-02-23T17:47:42	MTHE_1 If you went on about the Koran in Bangladesh or Indonesia it would hurt your electoral prospects badly
DougSaunders	702187817267367936	2016-02-23T17:46:36	dayofthemutant Most coutries with high immigartion are doing it to prevent population decline, not to create population growth
DougSaunders	702187291112919041	2016-02-23T17:44:30	dayofthemutant Yes, but the other benefits are well known; there has been some contention over specifically economic benefits
DougSaunders	702186586595721216	2016-02-23T17:41:42	pipskipple Better to use same tracks for both purposes. Airport trains have to be less than 20 minutes full trip or will fail.
DougSaunders	702185827313459200	2016-02-23T17:38:41	MTHE_1 I can't think of another Western country where being a biblical literalist would be politically advantageous
DougSaunders	702185482772320256	2016-02-23T17:37:19	Analysis: best economic outcomes happen with some immigration restrictions, but fewer restrictions than we have now 
DougSaunders	702183860990115841	2016-02-23T17:30:53	pipskipple Also, airport trains shouldn't be big targets for state funding -- they're used by people who've just paid hundreds for a ticket
DougSaunders	702183707260489728	2016-02-23T17:30:16	andreweckford Limo service from my house (Christie pits) is $50 plus tip.
DougSaunders	702182473690513408	2016-02-23T17:25:22	pipskipple SteveBurtch Cutting the cost of an airport taxi in half seems pretty good for people of any income
DougSaunders	702182265359458304	2016-02-23T17:24:32	TotenCan Half the cost of a taxi seems to be standard pricing for airport trains. So Toronto would be $25/way under that index
DougSaunders	702175431210831872	2016-02-23T16:57:23	SteveBurtch pipskipple $12 does the same trick (especially now that it's $6 half way). Cheaper than a taxi and it's a commuter solution.
DougSaunders	702172130935328769	2016-02-23T16:44:16	TrustedTrevor Not true. If you went on about the Koran in any of the 3 largest Muslim countries, you'd never get elected
DougSaunders	702162128384331777	2016-02-23T16:04:31	paulfbanderson (The new fare probably reduces the likelihood that I'll do so)
DougSaunders	702162032154451968	2016-02-23T16:04:08	paulfbanderson Need to add the cost of taking an Uber or taxi to the nearest station.. I've often said "hell, I'll just stay in the cab"
DougSaunders	702160663011983360	2016-02-23T15:58:42	EsbenNeander Yes, the taxis are prohibitively expensive.
DougSaunders	702160493704654848	2016-02-23T15:58:01	paulfbanderson Well, it's a cheap train now!
DougSaunders	702150761682087937	2016-02-23T15:19:21	CorComm The two extra stops do slow things down somewhat, but I don't think a zero-stop option would work in Toronto, as nice as it is
DougSaunders	702150629897031680	2016-02-23T15:18:50	TrineeshB I may be misremembering!
DougSaunders	702150539065229312	2016-02-23T15:18:28	paulfbanderson It's not very premium -- was half the cost of a taxi, now a quarter.
DougSaunders	702150339516956672	2016-02-23T15:17:40	thecjm There are always other options. Cabs, buses. Actual need is for transit that gets you from stations to the airport (not "premium")
DougSaunders	702148744284737536	2016-02-23T15:11:20	paulfbanderson Isn't the train the same thing as a subway going all the way to Pearson?
DougSaunders	702148616182374401	2016-02-23T15:10:50	thecjm Oh, that's an awful train -- may as well just take the Piccadilly line if you've got an afternoon to spare
DougSaunders	702148517066702853	2016-02-23T15:10:26	CorComm I think what we wanted was "reliable and not many stops." Which is what we've got
DougSaunders	702147447091363840	2016-02-23T15:06:11	(And to say "public transit must be cheaper than a cab" you must realize many need to pay for a cab to get to the public transit anyway)
DougSaunders	702147240610037760	2016-02-23T15:05:22	TrineeshB Yes, although from my experience a taxi downtown also costs very little
DougSaunders	702146211206180864	2016-02-23T15:01:16	A cab to the airport does cost about $100 in Stockholm and $120 in London, whereas in Toronto it's a $50 bargain, so there's that
DougSaunders	702145910176747521	2016-02-23T15:00:04	melchigr Airport cab is $50 in Toronto. It's about twice that much in stockholm, three times in London
DougSaunders	702144795532103680	2016-02-23T14:55:39	AdrianHiel That's not an express, though, just regular train with a stop at the airport, if I recall.
DougSaunders	702144630553317377	2016-02-23T14:54:59	TFCNU2 Yeah, all airport trains offer cheaper fares for families/groups or returns. I'm comparing apples to apples.
DougSaunders	702143677951422465	2016-02-23T14:51:12	So it is a bit weird that Toronto's very nice airport express is going down to $9 and people still think this is pricey.
DougSaunders	702143242809159682	2016-02-23T14:49:28	(The Heathrow Express is $45 each way and is even more popular, even with a subway station literally in the airport)
DougSaunders	702142863572803584	2016-02-23T14:47:58	Stockholm's airport express train costs about CAD $50, one-way, per person for a 20-minute ride. It's quite popular.
DougSaunders	702140506973696000	2016-02-23T14:38:36	DDesBaillets Not even that many. In the three largest Muslim countries, it would be totally unacceptable
DougSaunders	702139068537176064	2016-02-23T14:32:53	In any other country, a candidate caught saying the Bible had "all the answers" would disqualify him.

DougSaunders	702128747080646656	2016-02-23T13:51:52	But as I learned, applying Scalia's "originalism" in Canada is easier, because the Framers answer their own phones 
DougSaunders	702128374110552065	2016-02-23T13:50:23	PaulaHibbLew030 Well, they could put her picture on some sort of a coin. Also, there's only one other Underground line named after her
DougSaunders	702127662420996097	2016-02-23T13:47:34	Because he made such a mess of US law, Antonin Scalia's  originalism will never catch on in counties like Canada
