CarsonSieving	714294755350413312	2016-03-28T03:35:15	Real question: what current tv shows am I missing out on by not having cable? The two I hear about are OJ on FX and Scandal
CarsonSieving	714294112414011392	2016-03-28T03:32:41	In the age of Twitter, tv news is irrelevant (unless CNN finds the plane). Red carpet dresses are posted within minutes. What am I missing?
CarsonSieving	714292526136606721	2016-03-28T03:26:23	The only time I have really wanted cable in the last year was Hamilton at the Emmys.
CarsonSieving	714291940251054080	2016-03-28T03:24:04	And if most of the shows "people are talking about" are on Netflix, Amazon, HBO, SHO, cable becomes less essential
CarsonSieving	714291000374591488	2016-03-28T03:20:20	Now most of my friends consider Netflix a must have, on top of cable, HBO and SHO (or maybe it's that we all have jobs now).
CarsonSieving	714290587558678528	2016-03-28T03:18:41	5 years ago, cord cutting + Netflix + Hulu gave you lots of not-current content. And Netflix/Hulu for many was a cost in lieu of cable
CarsonSieving	714290016202145793	2016-03-28T03:16:25	Surfeit of excellent shows makes for less "must see tv", most people have a natural cap on # of weekly or binged shows (ex sports, news)
CarsonSieving	714289177865633792	2016-03-28T03:13:05	Hypothesis: This era of great tv shows is going to kill tv.

CarsonSieving	714281075510345728	2016-03-28T02:40:53	Why unbundling will happen: only 2% NY area households watch Yankees games on TV. Yet all pay $5/mo for YES Network.

CarsonSieving	712851449198280704	2016-03-24T04:00:04	AoDespair by focusing on empathy, while not condemning speech, statement enabled the debate about speech to continue .fin.
CarsonSieving	712850991838838784	2016-03-24T03:58:15	AoDespair I thought the Harvard letter that emphasized speech over empathy allowed the [lack of] empathy angle to hijack the discussion 1/

CarsonSieving	712848661311528960	2016-03-24T03:48:59	AoDespair ok, Univs and E should welcome all ideas/debate and the admin was correct for not condemning the Trump chalking. Does that work?
