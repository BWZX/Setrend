joegilster	725480009763164160	2016-04-28T00:21:27	bmiller22 I'm short some now.  This Asia session is downright ridiculous though.
joegilster	725473229658185728	2016-04-27T23:54:31	My biggest regret of the week?  Not selling a ton of 32.0s in M6 ten minutes ago.  Next meeting is a long way off from now.
joegilster	725472820654796802	2016-04-27T23:52:53	I think the u6 butterfly is mispriced.  Should be closer to a 2.0 trade.

joegilster	725467232919162880	2016-04-27T23:30:41	bmiller22 talk about a garbage time rally
joegilster	725466930232975360	2016-04-27T23:29:29	bmiller22 what is happening in Eurodollars right now?  These prices are outrageous.

joegilster	725396459361701888	2016-04-27T18:49:27	Well I thought I'd June was really in play they would set he table for it, they didn't do that directly.  Looks like more waiting
joegilster	725395424530419713	2016-04-27T18:45:21	I went from thinking that was hawkish, to dovish, to somewhere in between.  They didn't hint at June and didn't put in "balanced"
joegilster	725334154804490240	2016-04-27T14:41:53	I read recent fed statements again, seems like the phrase, "at the next meeting" will have to be in there for a June hike to be the baseline
joegilster	725098282016452608	2016-04-26T23:04:36	MKBTrade if they don't hike before election, which means December hike at earliest, I think that's super bullish for ES
joegilster	725098114374324226	2016-04-26T23:03:56	MKBTrade agree that ES close above 97, would be ridiculously strong buying signal to me.
joegilster	725097982614446081	2016-04-26T23:03:25	MKBTrade yeah I'm not sure on the dollar, I think if they're going to raise in June they'll make it very clear tomorrow.
joegilster	725091989369327618	2016-04-26T22:39:36	MKBTrade hey man what do you think about tomorrow?

joegilster	725021865865936896	2016-04-26T18:00:57	IronFlies so much harder to make money right now than January.  It's survival time, capital preservation until it gets good again, IMO
joegilster	725020331375611904	2016-04-26T17:54:51	Average daily range z7 Eurodollars in January this year was 9.47 ticks... Average range the last 19 trading days, it's been 5.52 ticks.

joegilster	723525124725440512	2016-04-22T14:53:26	If crude really goes higher before June I could see the fed saying they'll wait on a hike because rising energy costs could hurt consumption
joegilster	723524538923778048	2016-04-22T14:51:07	kk8591 I agree, we needed a good run of data, especially inflation to make a June possible, now it seems less likely, despite m6 price move
joegilster	723520524320563200	2016-04-22T14:35:10	kk8591 Well I agree with you that z7 got oversold this week.  You really think no hikes this year?

joegilster	721859905678876672	2016-04-18T00:36:27	DorsiaReserved agreed, hard to get in. I got interviews at a lot prop firms applying online, but got stonewalled by big banks &amp; Hedge funds
joegilster	721859021330898944	2016-04-18T00:32:56	DorsiaReserved yeah then it makes sense not to have one.
joegilster	721858681546153984	2016-04-18T00:31:35	DorsiaReserved yeah in that case it doesn't seem worth it.  Our HR isn't like that
joegilster	721858509659336704	2016-04-18T00:30:54	chigrl already spending that oil money?  Jk
joegilster	721858295292674050	2016-04-18T00:30:03	DorsiaReserved haha that's true.
joegilster	721858066715668480	2016-04-18T00:29:09	DorsiaReserved agreed on that but having a profile gives long shot upside without much cost.
joegilster	721856971448696833	2016-04-18T00:24:48	DorsiaReserved my only counter would be that I know people who get recruited off of there to join other companies via head hunters.
joegilster	721856323659411456	2016-04-18T00:22:13	DorsiaReserved why do you think that?  Just wondering because I don't have a profile and was wondering if it's of any value to have one.
joegilster	721824855507599361	2016-04-17T22:17:11	Where does crude reverse?  Seems like it's a sale until news comes out at this point.  Hard to get in if you weren't short over the weekend
joegilster	721824613378842624	2016-04-17T22:16:13	Move impressive move z6 Eurodollars up two ticks from Friday close
joegilster	721824493568598017	2016-04-17T22:15:44	Wow crude got smokes.  Eurodollars z7 99.5 bid they closed at 97.0 offer Friday

joegilster	720981201872224256	2016-04-15T14:24:48	Aggressive but side orders in Eurodollars after Michigan numbers.  Why?  I don't know
joegilster	720968260456308736	2016-04-15T13:33:22	Light volume day with a lot of Algos and fake size, not a lot of "reason" to move, I'll be looking to trade light and not ruin the weekend.
joegilster	720663895401050116	2016-04-14T17:23:56	Jared Bernstein is the least credible "economist" that gets air time on CNBC

joegilster	720654131774423041	2016-04-14T16:45:08	A little bit of steepening going on here in Eurodollars.  Spreads bid all around.

joegilster	720613201218445313	2016-04-14T14:02:30	I just watched a guy light $100,000 on fire in the Eurodollars by not knowing how to execute
joegilster	720609558595391490	2016-04-14T13:48:01	RyanJReynolds ANichols70 what's does jstambough think?  Are there still Rams fans where you live?
joegilster	720608597588115456	2016-04-14T13:44:12	ANichols70 yeah well that's what they could have built out in a major way with picks 15, 43, 45, 76. That's two starters and depth on OL
joegilster	720606578240413700	2016-04-14T13:36:11	ANichols70 I guess we have Goff rated differently, which is okay.  I just feel like it was lopsided towards the Titans. They killed it IMO.
joegilster	720604746638172161	2016-04-14T13:28:54	ANichols70 last year with Winston and Mariota in the draft, a move like this makes more sense.
joegilster	720604484544520192	2016-04-14T13:27:51	ANichols70 you can't give up that kind of value unless there is a good QB in the draft.
joegilster	720603245358370817	2016-04-14T13:22:56	This is what getting picked off looks like.  I would be furious if I was a Rams fan.

joegilster	720572425117806592	2016-04-14T11:20:28	To me the price action since PPI and retail sales has been really bearish Eurodollars.  We couldn't hold a bid after some bad data
joegilster	720310679391981568	2016-04-13T18:00:23	feral_hog thanks I agree with June.  We're gonna need a real hot run of inflation and wage data now.
joegilster	720310248049758208	2016-04-13T17:58:40	MarketOwls Reuters wow I guess I'm more bearish Eurodollars than a lot of people out there.
joegilster	720281567696846849	2016-04-13T16:04:42	erwillia that's true, but they look strong to me.  Quite a rip from 1800 to now, and crude from $26 to here, and all pretty fast.
joegilster	720281195393626112	2016-04-13T16:03:13	erwillia ES looks like it's going to make a new high.  Fed cares about that I think.

joegilster	720244833680359429	2016-04-13T13:38:44	Wow what a fade in treasuries.  Guys why did Eurodollars break back down on that, and this is coming from someone who is usually short
joegilster	720241112451932163	2016-04-13T13:23:57	And all the treasuries are red
joegilster	720238715306582016	2016-04-13T13:14:25	IronFlies weird.  I expected higher in Eurodollars.  It's interesting z6-z7 looks real strong maybe not pushing hikes back there
joegilster	720238139768307712	2016-04-13T13:12:08	Pretty interesting fade in the bonds here guys
joegilster	720234933562683396	2016-04-13T12:59:24	InterestArb agree we have to remember they're not in a hurry.  And they don't have to move for any reason, unless inflation is red hot.
joegilster	720234266295033857	2016-04-13T12:56:45	InterestArb ahhh am I crazy to think 16 still possible for two hikes?  Eurodollars thinks so
joegilster	720234085457592320	2016-04-13T12:56:01	maverickgold7 I guess I'm silly enough to believe the fed when they said two hikes this year
joegilster	720231722550300673	2016-04-13T12:46:38	This is the kind of data that makes me doubt the fed will hike again in June

joegilster	719553015326199809	2016-04-11T15:49:42	The slow grind up in Eurodollars.  Hard to stay with these moves, but when you do it's awesome.  I'm flat.

joegilster	718515631553798144	2016-04-08T19:07:30	boes_ feral_hog right I mean the December Eurodollars is nowhere near two hikes
joegilster	718515262593445889	2016-04-08T19:06:02	boes_ feral_hog I don't think those forecasts are in line with what we are seeing in the futures market at all

joegilster	718454179283345409	2016-04-08T15:03:19	joegilster now I know the bonds were a buy and Eurodollars got dragged up.  But in the heat of the moment people bought z6 "at any price"
joegilster	718453830224990213	2016-04-08T15:01:56	People buying z6 in the 20s yesterday made me want to punch my computer.  Because I was short in m6.  I couldn't see the market clearly.

joegilster	718400842617892865	2016-04-08T11:31:22	I'm thinking yesterday was the short squeeze in Eurodollars, and it was a hell of a squeeze.  Z6-z7 already way higher this morning

joegilster	718165663752171520	2016-04-07T19:56:51	Here comes the fed trying to talk to markets again. We don't believe you. Williams tells fox business that the economy is doing "quite well"
joegilster	718108980589887489	2016-04-07T16:11:37	kk8591 well I think they're at least trying to help the situation, haha, although that does seem funny.
joegilster	718108526233563136	2016-04-07T16:09:49	kk8591 yeah.  I really hope the central bankers know what they're doing, and NIRP helps, but I think they're making it up as they go along.
joegilster	718107718670614528	2016-04-07T16:06:36	kk8591 maybe I'm being naive but I think the data is good enough for a hike or two this year.  But I'm an outsider now on this view.

joegilster	718101592570892288	2016-04-07T15:42:16	These moves in Eurodollars are so hard to call, when the rally was over there it felt like max pain, but impossible to sell for me
joegilster	718097878447575040	2016-04-07T15:27:30	Today - like many others - makes the Fed’s dot plot look just delusional.
joegilster	718097037095346176	2016-04-07T15:24:09	MarketOwls yeah but what I'm wondering is how much we need to converge towards those foreign yields
joegilster	718093801454047232	2016-04-07T15:11:18	I guess our bond yields aren't low enough yet, global demand for bond yield not satiated
joegilster	718079169582661637	2016-04-07T14:13:09	How sensitive bonds are to oil prices right now is truly amazing.  I don't know if it's Algos or what, but oil just dominating the trade

joegilster	718074574991073280	2016-04-07T13:54:54	MarcoMNYC MKBTrade no that could definitely happen, and those February prices are justifiable in bonds but not in Eurodollars IMO
joegilster	718070436064407552	2016-04-07T13:38:27	Eurodollars have another up move in them probably before it's safe to fade, no one has even done anything totally insane yet.

joegilster	710070195352641536	2016-03-16T11:48:21	My guess is unless inflation data comes out amazing, we're not hiking rates again until June.  I know April is trendy right now though.

joegilster	707036499645075456	2016-03-08T02:53:32	DorsiaReserved yeah I guess that's what happens when you leave rates too low for way too long
joegilster	707029106819334145	2016-03-08T02:24:09	Citigroup forecasts 2 rates hikes by the fed this year.  Sounds right but I think anyone who watches futures had that already.

joegilster	705186799581200385	2016-03-03T00:23:29	Almost nobody in the world will know what happened the past hour in z7 but it's a perfect example of why the ED market is owned by algos

joegilster	704771360115929088	2016-03-01T20:52:40	I won't buy z6 until it's below 9900.0
joegilster	704770590494724096	2016-03-01T20:49:37	I admit I scratched a lot of shorts in z6 in the 20.0s. So frustrating.  Long spreads worked but I didn't hold them long enough as usual.
joegilster	704769927203332096	2016-03-01T20:46:59	joegilster one guy in the office says they liked the Super Tuesday results so far.  That seems like a stretch to me.

joegilster	703191975789334530	2016-02-26T12:16:46	I couldn't sell 26.0s yesterday in z6 so I'm flat.  Will just try to get on board of today's data reaction. Looking for good data today

joegilster	700443957486964737	2016-02-18T22:17:07	Bullard turning dovish makes me want to sell eurodollars more.
joegilster	700442479351480321	2016-02-18T22:11:15	IronFlies that's what I'm saying.  The hard thing is if you put decent size on it can be a 5 figure loser real fast.
joegilster	700442041579347968	2016-02-18T22:09:30	IronFlies which means price should be 25 or higher
joegilster	700441903804841984	2016-02-18T22:08:58	IronFlies yeah one last panic.  I sure hope we get in when its time.  I keep thinking there will be at least one rate rise between z6-z7
joegilster	700441369232437248	2016-02-18T22:06:50	IronFlies probably right, I want to be long but we could see some better prices
joegilster	700440562130907136	2016-02-18T22:03:38	Looking at closing prices I want to buy eurodollar spreads BUT people in the office are still bullish eurodollars.

joegilster	700350189215682560	2016-02-18T16:04:31	Out of zn.  Worth a try
joegilster	700345817010339841	2016-02-18T15:47:09	Guys if you watched the eurodollars on that rally.  THEY couldn't go with treasuries.  Backs did a little but. U6, z6, h7 had a hard time
joegilster	700332653115912194	2016-02-18T14:54:50	Sold zn up here 130-21.   Trying to hold to the low of the day

joegilster	700041746156093440	2016-02-17T19:38:53	joegilster the thing about those crazy run ups in bonds/eurodollar prices... We find those levels again, see oct 2014 flash crash day chart
joegilster	700041511048650752	2016-02-17T19:37:57	Everyone talking about last Thursday as if it was obviously capitulation.  It was SO hard to sell that day, but it paid huge.

joegilster	699674858897043457	2016-02-16T19:21:00	IronFlies haha.  It works better than thinking things through in a rational way.
joegilster	699674518936117249	2016-02-16T19:19:39	IronFlies there was a very large real money buyer who came in earlier to buy  z6 9925.0 which makes sense as its a key price.
joegilster	699673961207066626	2016-02-16T19:17:26	IronFlies but your position is probably correct because an just ran out of sellers down here all day
joegilster	699673746437582851	2016-02-16T19:16:35	IronFlies I'm long spreads small because I don't know what they're trying to do here.  I thought z6 would be lower with this ES move today

joegilster	697512888022335488	2016-02-10T20:10:06	IronFlies I think we're being dragged up by bonds obviously, but I don't know.  People keep warning me these ED spreads can go negative.
joegilster	697512290946457600	2016-02-10T20:07:43	IronFlies I think so, it's three years away and Yellen wasn't that dovish today.  She may pause, for a while but that's a long way out.

joegilster	695784934515019776	2016-02-06T01:43:50	IronFlies we've been waiting for wage growth for so long, if it prints there again going forward, it's on, fed cares about that a lot IMO
joegilster	695784399984578560	2016-02-06T01:41:42	MarcoMNYC that's a very interesting one. There's a lot of factors involved with that type of employment I suspect. I'll think about it too.
joegilster	695784189816348672	2016-02-06T01:40:52	IronFlies there was sell pressure in the white eurodollars. I sold too far back in the curve, which wouldn't break much when ES broke hard
joegilster	695783093442125824	2016-02-06T01:36:31	I can't stop thinking about how good avg hourly earning is and how it is a game changer, wish I saw it more clearly today.

joegilster	694982701510578176	2016-02-03T20:36:02	Guys the past few days eurodollars have had a panic up move. And retracements have been small, we're making higher highs, need huge NFP now

joegilster	694629181687099393	2016-02-02T21:11:17	So this eurodollar rally is because A German bank is getting crushed?  I guess I'm the last to know.
joegilster	694613527265304576	2016-02-02T20:09:04	enijensohn that DB chart is horrible

joegilster	694561241260380160	2016-02-02T16:41:18	IronFlies I agree with that.  PCE and CPI and wage growth are real low.
joegilster	694559734381174784	2016-02-02T16:35:19	IronFlies I guess I just haven't given up on another hike or two this year, maybe I'm being too stubborn on that.
joegilster	694558563922907136	2016-02-02T16:30:40	IronFlies I get that we ignore them some, but one hike over a whole year is just crazy to me. I mean this hiking cycle is already over?

joegilster	687625712984035328	2016-01-14T13:22:00	GE490 I agree it looks really low.  I keep thinking the will be sellers stepping in if M6 gets into the mid 20s
joegilster	687623355567046656	2016-01-14T13:12:38	GE490 yeah for BIG size too, for the overnight session it was big size at least.  One year spread has 30k plus
joegilster	687608188275822593	2016-01-14T12:12:21	Of course Tom Lee is still bullish
joegilster	687576455316815872	2016-01-14T10:06:16	Eurodollar whites down while rest of curve is up guys, you don't see this very often.

joegilster	687541360761548800	2016-01-14T07:46:48	Why are stocks rallying so much?
joegilster	687529665691389952	2016-01-14T07:00:20	Everyone just was falling all over themselves to scratch the 21.5s that were a great sale in m6.  Donkeys
joegilster	687517608745156609	2016-01-14T06:12:26	MrMacroMarkets yah maybe the greens are a better risk reward. I gotta think this over, I just think curve is short term overbought a little
joegilster	687510603619930112	2016-01-14T05:44:35	I want to be short red eurodollars but need to be careful about size so my risk manager doesn't get mad if I gotta take some heat.
joegilster	687507719352238080	2016-01-14T05:33:08	DontFadeeMeBro IronFlies me too
joegilster	687507673479155712	2016-01-14T05:32:57	IronFlies plus, there has to be sellers near 25 in m6 and God forbid if we get near 72.5 in z7
joegilster	687507481598164992	2016-01-14T05:32:11	IronFlies right.  And I think it will be a great trade if the data Friday morning is really good.
joegilster	687506834303787008	2016-01-14T05:29:37	IronFlies yup.  Until the pain stops in crude and Chinese stocks, I guess we're going to keep going.
joegilster	687506285978189826	2016-01-14T05:27:26	IronFlies I keep thinking its overdone but we keep rallying.  11 days in a row now.

joegilster	687499430522556416	2016-01-14T05:00:12	We really need some good macroeconomic data guys
joegilster	687498601728061440	2016-01-14T04:56:54	Z6 eurodollars December 30th low was 9873.5, today's high was 9902.5.  That's more than one rate hike taken out of the futures guys.

joegilster	687215449663119360	2016-01-13T10:11:45	He puts 30k on the bid, pulls his offer, gets algos to do the same, it's because HE WANTS you to trade the now small sized offer.
joegilster	687214987455025152	2016-01-13T10:09:55	If this guy in h6 isn't manipulating the market by pulling size and placing and pulling 30k lot orders, then I don't know what it is.
joegilster	687200822506070016	2016-01-13T09:13:38	Oh no.  I hope the low volume, boring night trades aren't back.
joegilster	686871094460981248	2016-01-12T11:23:25	Fischer predicts productivity growth will EVENTUALLY recover.  How long is eventually?  And why do people think that, it's not going to.
joegilster	686868472790269952	2016-01-12T11:12:59	InEgo_ Haha well said.  It must be nice to blow up and then get all of your money back thanks to the government.
joegilster	686867787919196160	2016-01-12T11:10:16	Hell of a snap back off the lows eurodollar.  Guys this market has been crazy at night so far this year.  Some good some bad
joegilster	686866848487354368	2016-01-12T11:06:32	InEgo_ so one thought I always just had about thought IOER, it really was a way to hook up the banks.
joegilster	686863955310948352	2016-01-12T10:55:02	What the HELL is going on in z6
joegilster	686863879100469249	2016-01-12T10:54:44	InEgo_ right.  I guess there is no other way to control the rates now.
joegilster	686863191456890881	2016-01-12T10:52:00	Now the guys buying z6 for size at 6.5 now puking his guts out.  I'm happy to see it as he ruined what should have been an orderly selldown
joegilster	686862625980825601	2016-01-12T10:49:45	InEgo_ isn't paying out IOER contractionary?
joegilster	686853882186629120	2016-01-12T10:15:01	Fischer could easily move us again if he says anything material here at 4:30am Chicago time
joegilster	686853630079549440	2016-01-12T10:14:01	etleggett good point
joegilster	686853117388820480	2016-01-12T10:11:58	I think what finally broke us was ES catching a bid off the lows
joegilster	686853042658914304	2016-01-12T10:11:41	Guys everyone here saw the long end lead the front end tonight.  The front end, ZT LAGGED for so long it made it hard to stay short.
joegilster	686838755085266944	2016-01-12T09:14:54	It was so hard to stay short eurodollars there.
joegilster	686835353336979456	2016-01-12T09:01:23	jimcramer it's just so hard to be long commodities right now.  It's a beat down in oil every night trading session.

joegilster	686826984597422080	2016-01-12T08:28:08	Zn and ZF broke from their high of the day to their low, eurodollars h7 down almost a tick from its high.

joegilster	686822502236995585	2016-01-12T08:10:19	AoverK not sure on packs I don't have those up but z6 9896.5 trading so that's not pricing in the full 4 more holes this year
joegilster	686822078343811072	2016-01-12T08:08:38	H6-u6 eurodollars trading 22.0 is too low.  Full stop.
joegilster	686821595415875584	2016-01-12T08:06:43	Bonds broke a lot here and eurodollars can't move so either they're strong as an ox, or mkt afraid of that 6k buyer in z6.
joegilster	686815449477062656	2016-01-12T07:42:18	Bonds breaking here eurodollars can't go offered
joegilster	686813041929793536	2016-01-12T07:32:44	Crude and ES telling bonds where to go here, listening and looking closely for crude headlines tonight

joegilster	686809648318427136	2016-01-12T07:19:15	AoverK I'll tell you when I get flat
joegilster	686806715631706112	2016-01-12T07:07:35	AoverK agreed
joegilster	686804570287149056	2016-01-12T06:59:04	AoverK I think they're just trying to get off the zero lower bound because they feel like they have to.
joegilster	686804184373440513	2016-01-12T06:57:32	Feels like it's going to be one of those nights where bonds slowly drift up and it's hard to get on the move
joegilster	686793879270510592	2016-01-12T06:16:35	Another session, another crude beat down.  Equities following.

joegilster	686480704784314369	2016-01-11T09:32:08	IronFlies etleggett haha that is a disaster.  I rarely let the market get me visibly upset, but tonight is one of those times.
joegilster	686479879483727872	2016-01-11T09:28:52	etleggett IronFlies good advice... yeah I need to get out of here.  I'm yelling a lot and possibly scaring the younger traders.
joegilster	686478700573925377	2016-01-11T09:24:11	IronFlies ouch well I know the feeling, getting killed over here, just doing everything wrong
joegilster	686475134404669440	2016-01-11T09:10:00	IronFlies it's crazy in this ED market.  Good call on z7 being a little too high.
joegilster	686474411948412928	2016-01-11T09:07:08	etleggett yeah they have been way over shooting lately, both up and down.  I just feel bad I usually nail a move like that.
joegilster	686473750242430976	2016-01-11T09:04:30	Not making money in that breakdown in eurodollars feels like a kick in the teeth.
joegilster	686078928289677312	2016-01-10T06:55:37	RyanJReynolds tough way to go agreed.  Steelers got away with some dirty plays as usual, but we only have ourselves to blame

joegilster	685543265941065728	2016-01-08T19:27:06	IronFlies I've talked to a fair amount of people that think curve gets real flat or inverted this year
joegilster	685543073762390016	2016-01-08T19:26:20	IronFlies right. That's right way to look at it, decision around 9855.0, if it goes higher, nothing up there but air&amp;We could flatten more.
joegilster	685540256993665024	2016-01-08T19:15:08	IronFlies that's a good point, still though, z7, damn that daily chart is giant green bars lately.

joegilster	684654314053210113	2016-01-06T08:34:43	IronFlies then follows up with two more big hits, 2k, then 3.5k.  Slowed down what would have been a decent little rally in the Reds/greens
joegilster	684654097706827776	2016-01-06T08:33:51	IronFlies ZN started to look like it was rallying, eurodollars go bid small in the backs, Boom, guy sells 5k 22.0s h8 at 1:56.03.
joegilster	684653271265329153	2016-01-06T08:30:34	Guys I'm sure you saw the big seller in h8, made the rally tough to hold onto longs as he sold 16,000 22s in that half hour

joegilster	684646706714001408	2016-01-06T08:04:29	Crude. --- no buyers tonight ES not following it down that closely
joegilster	684646414475857921	2016-01-06T08:03:19	M7 eurodollar guy is flashing a 4000 lot, either wants market lower or needs a fill and will come down.  Probably a fake order
joegilster	684645857380057088	2016-01-06T08:01:07	5000 lot sale h8 eurodollars hits the 22 bid.   Very large sale for this time of night.

joegilster	684324254435786752	2016-01-05T10:43:11	GE490 thanks john, that makes sense. Just annoying because there is no way that guy intends to transact the full amount of his order
joegilster	684321001216188416	2016-01-05T10:30:15	Why are people allowed to flash 30,000 lot markets in eurodollars with no repercussions?  H6 4:30am.
joegilster	684317088765231104	2016-01-05T10:14:42	etleggett I think it will be a hard fade unless stocks stop the beat down

joegilster	684287603923763200	2016-01-05T08:17:32	Light volume compared to last night in eurodollars, but enough range to do some things.  This Europe trade isn't so bad.

joegilster	683953759236390912	2016-01-04T10:10:58	SkynetFutures DontFadeeMeBro I think it's more because there is actually a range today rather than most days when h6 trades 2 or 3 prices
joegilster	683952267460870144	2016-01-04T10:05:02	DontFadeeMeBro SkynetFutures there just isn't any two way flow, they're not bailing anyone who is hung out like they usually do.
