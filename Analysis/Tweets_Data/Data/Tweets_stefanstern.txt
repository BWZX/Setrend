stefanstern	684324402285117440	2016-01-05T10:43:46	octaviusblack Perhaps so. Of course leadership matters but big businesses are complicated and one person doesn't do all the work. As 1/2
stefanstern	684323074678861824	2016-01-05T10:38:29	octaviusblack Well I obvs agree with that, + the sign this is being taken seriously will be a closing of the gap (min wage hike also good!)
stefanstern	684322037385527296	2016-01-05T10:34:22	octaviusblack The "market" failure is probably clearest in business + it is also the most important one. Bit of restraint is what we need.
