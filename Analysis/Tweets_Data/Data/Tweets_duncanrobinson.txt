duncanrobinson	726116020151267328	2016-04-29T18:28:44	DavideDenti An Eden of premium content...
duncanrobinson	726115903541252098	2016-04-29T18:28:16	DavideDenti true, but I would argue language skills way, way more important.
duncanrobinson	726115502247055360	2016-04-29T18:26:40	DavideDenti anyway I'm only thinking out loud as it generates interesting responses from smart people :)
duncanrobinson	726115253415755776	2016-04-29T18:25:41	DavideDenti would be interested to see figures, though. Plus daily commuters make up less than 1 per cent.
duncanrobinson	726114980651753472	2016-04-29T18:24:36	SeanSchneider yes, I am aware that "Schengen" covers more than just passport checks
duncanrobinson	726114605345456128	2016-04-29T18:23:07	DavideDenti sure. Multilingual world where people have enough disposable income to travel lots would be great.
duncanrobinson	726114270140862464	2016-04-29T18:21:47	DavideDenti ironically, it's minorities who often do not benefit from Schengen due to racist border checks
duncanrobinson	726113403564134401	2016-04-29T18:18:20	DavideDenti bit glib. But benefits of Schengen go to a small minority.
duncanrobinson	726111204968681476	2016-04-29T18:09:36	SimonFRCox I know I'm being glib but I find the obsession with Schengen as be-all/end-all strange. Way less imp than freedom of movement.
duncanrobinson	726110730605481984	2016-04-29T18:07:43	SimonFRCox true, but Schengen commuters = less than 1 per cent of Schengen area
