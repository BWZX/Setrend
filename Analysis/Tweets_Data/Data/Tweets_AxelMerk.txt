AxelMerk	708309241140891648	2016-03-11T15:10:57	Reason why Draghi said rates have bottomed may be because focus has shifted to spreads banks can make in negative environments TLTRO2

AxelMerk	707938594808156164	2016-03-10T14:38:08	Draghi: we are not in deflation. Inflation will be negative for a few months, but turn positive because of our measures
