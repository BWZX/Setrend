Gilesyb	724936757129654272	2016-04-26T12:22:46	It is precisely because we know they are so good that we know this is not about safety. If this is a big paycut, fine: it offends justice.
Gilesyb	724936561029160963	2016-04-26T12:21:59	But if there is any profession alive that does NOT act in the wrong way as automatic consequence of pay incentives, it is doctors, surely

Gilesyb	720843886738821120	2016-04-15T05:19:09	JoMicheII because any single AD curve captures one amount of spending
Gilesyb	720732449555247105	2016-04-14T21:56:21	JoMicheII e.g. You can make an AD curve on its own. You need *both* before you have an economic model. Agreed?
Gilesyb	720731773056000000	2016-04-14T21:53:39	JoMicheII you've tweeted me an article that describes AD as downward sloping. That's the point I'm making. It IS!
Gilesyb	720731549696716800	2016-04-14T21:52:46	JoMicheII dave_chivers this shows, surely, that it's downward sloping!. Aggregate expenditure EQUALS ngdp. So if P higher, Y lower, right?
Gilesyb	720731227565764608	2016-04-14T21:51:29	JoMicheII an economy has both though. See e.g. This 
Gilesyb	720728739827576832	2016-04-14T21:41:36	JoMicheII dave_chivers and the "paradox" of how ADAS treats wages up? None. It's a rise in the AD curve. Output rises, prices rise. Easy.
Gilesyb	720726792206749696	2016-04-14T21:33:52	JoMicheII dave_chivers bottom line: does ADAS capture how shocks affect economy in P-Y space? Yes. +ve D shocks increase P and Y. Etc
Gilesyb	720726167138000897	2016-04-14T21:31:23	JoMicheII dave_chivers yes! That's the point I'm making! You discover the shape of one by imagining the way the equilibrium moves....
Gilesyb	720692626903711744	2016-04-14T19:18:06	GavinHJackson or just messing with reserve ratios. Plenty of tools can influence demand for money - not just government paper trading
Gilesyb	720692310581895168	2016-04-14T19:16:51	JoMicheII dave_chivers the shape of one curve is the outcome caused by movements in the other one
Gilesyb	720692179933511681	2016-04-14T19:16:20	JoMicheII dave_chivers and vice versa negative AS shocks. Therefore, AD curve is downward sloping. Seems uncontroversial IMHO
Gilesyb	720691903080095744	2016-04-14T19:15:14	JoMicheII dave_chivers 2 so what does up move in AS do? Positive supply shock means lower prices, higher output. Movement *along* AD curve
Gilesyb	720691586057834496	2016-04-14T19:13:58	JoMicheII 1surely you divine the shape of the curve by imagining demand held steady -AD CURVE not moving- and ask what changes in supply do
Gilesyb	720691165759160325	2016-04-14T19:12:18	JoMicheII dave_chivers I think there's confusion between changes in demand curve and change along the curve

Gilesyb	720223198663598080	2016-04-13T12:12:46	AbiWilks but it's a good article. Perceptions of fairness influence willingness to go along with the rules
Gilesyb	720222792893997056	2016-04-13T12:11:09	AbiWilks I wish he had spelled Janan's surname right.

Gilesyb	720170772719890433	2016-04-13T08:44:26	Gilesyb SebastianEPayne A point I made - differently - in TeleComment: 
Gilesyb	720165714208899072	2016-04-13T08:24:20	I am still very concerned about pressure from Tory donors making the gov less inclined to act, as I mention here  
Gilesyb	720170843146493952	2016-04-13T08:44:43	AbiWilks audioBoom valid concern I reckon
Gilesyb	720168095285964800	2016-04-13T08:33:48	AbiWilks sorry if mine came out angry. If we ever get that meetup I'll try to justify my atrocious pragmatism
Gilesyb	720164159518846976	2016-04-13T08:18:10	AbiWilks a concrete suggestion that four different fiscal areas suddenly unify their tax system is a bit JCR

Gilesyb	720163446193524736	2016-04-13T08:15:20	AbiWilks 5. Bottom line: my beef is always that *anyone* can posture. It takes bravery and political skill to find workable policies and
Gilesyb	720163200994570241	2016-04-13T08:14:21	AbiWilks 4. Which hurts valid arguments, like Uk unnecessary race to lower corporation tax rates. Or fair acknowledgment of e.g. OECD BEPS
Gilesyb	720162844994617344	2016-04-13T08:12:56	AbiWilks 3. No, not true that "multi nationals pay n no tax". Nor that governments have done nothing. Nor that all wealthy are evaders
Gilesyb	720162552383160320	2016-04-13T08:11:47	AbiWilks 2. Like many Guardian writers he thinks exaggeration wins more to his cause, but it's outputting. E.g.

Gilesyb	689121315337441284	2016-01-18T16:24:59	BenChu_ No, I think 2008 monetary policy fairly dire. That they were talking a tightening in 08 even as GDP fell was v significant.
Gilesyb	689119994756632576	2016-01-18T16:19:44	BenChu_ 2/2 it also (appeared) to have added to growth in the years before. So. It's a thing. Not TIME BOMB!!!
Gilesyb	689119840838225920	2016-01-18T16:19:07	BenChu_ Sure, but it took 10 years and a 60% rise in HH debt and then a credit crunch (and bad monetary policy) to do that. And 1/2
