LarrySabato	703736746622713856	2016-02-28T00:21:29	WoodardColin Sanders MIGHT do well in OK, too.
LarrySabato	703732542684438529	2016-02-28T00:04:47	SC D is a foreshadowing of Super Tuesday. Sanders will win VT of course, &amp; has a decent shot in CO, MA, MN. Clinton wins all the rest.
LarrySabato	703731900901421056	2016-02-28T00:02:14	Clinton declared winner of SC D primary instantly. I told you it would be over in a flash. Massive margin, based on 60+% black turnout.

LarrySabato	703067375055343616	2016-02-26T04:01:39	MrWalterShapiro That may well be part of it--but Trump was also being double-teamed by Rubio and Cruz, so Trump got a lot of response time.
LarrySabato	703066947471204352	2016-02-26T03:59:57	Debates are supposed to be about the candidates and their arguments--not the pundits, the moderators, and especially the audience.
LarrySabato	703066316337520640	2016-02-26T03:57:26	I didn't realize Trump had so much time (31:50) compared to Cruz(20:25), Rubio(17:13), Kasich(16.32), and Carson(10:36). CNNDebate
LarrySabato	703050553790697472	2016-02-26T02:54:48	BillKristol Love ya, Bill, but I'm surprised you support this lack of decorum. The audience detracts from the candidates' arguments.
LarrySabato	703049712597868544	2016-02-26T02:51:28	This has become embarrassing. The rude out-of-control audience has made the candidates worse. Now spectators YELLING things. Disgraceful.
LarrySabato	703047258833551360	2016-02-26T02:41:43	Rubio had a good line prepared on Trump's 5 repetitive statements, but he buried it--with the help of a noisy, irritating audience.
LarrySabato	703042485849858048	2016-02-26T02:22:45	Every Republican who's made a choice thinks their candidate is winning tonight. That's why, so far, little has changed--just reinforcement.
LarrySabato	703038988198813696	2016-02-26T02:08:51	Is a guy named John Kasich still running? I thought I glimpsed him, but my mind plays tricks.
LarrySabato	703038813514428418	2016-02-26T02:08:09	It's just an ear-splitting brawl. Plays to Trump's strengths.
LarrySabato	703038278702899204	2016-02-26T02:06:02	I see the screaming Roman Coliseum spectators are back. What happened to the old civility rules for debate audiences?

LarrySabato	703036100420505600	2016-02-26T01:57:22	Rubio and Cruz double-teaming Trump. But which one will step aside, and when, to consolidate some of the anti-Trump vote?
LarrySabato	703035634869530624	2016-02-26T01:55:31	Trump scores by saying at least he's hired people. Rubio gets points for going after Trump. But I'd score Trump the winner of this exchange.
LarrySabato	703034989613551616	2016-02-26T01:52:57	Trump goes after Mitt Romney, begins to even score with '12 nominee.

LarrySabato	698712304775512066	2016-02-14T03:36:09	JimHeathTV Correct. So.why would they do it? One possibility is the money given to the party by big donors who prefer X to Y.
LarrySabato	698710784562589696	2016-02-14T03:30:07	John Kasich's positive approach is looking better and better. Win or lose, he can at least hold his head high.
LarrySabato	698708693999886336	2016-02-14T03:21:48	I think we all know what Walter Cronkite would have said about his beloved network's handling of the debate and its out if control audience.

LarrySabato	698698738076819458	2016-02-14T02:42:15	Here is another example of how the RNC has failed to look out for the interests of their candidates and the image of the GOP.
LarrySabato	698698080917413888	2016-02-14T02:39:38	I've long favored a debate rule: "Silence is Golden". The audience's behavior is disgraceful. CBS should interrupt now and demand silence.

LarrySabato	698654382854967297	2016-02-13T23:45:59	LarrySabato ironic (but true) that death of a justice confirmed 98-0 will increase polarization.
LarrySabato	698656966999195648	2016-02-13T23:56:16	GOP candidates will engage in a bidding war on the vetting guarantees they'll seek from their nominee. Specific names will be floated.
LarrySabato	698656353494155265	2016-02-13T23:53:49	My guess: Obama will nominate a well-credentialed liberal and demand Senate action, which won't come. Clinton/Sanders will seize the issue.
LarrySabato	698654167032795136	2016-02-13T23:45:08	POTUS race now has top focus. Court vacancy becomes political football. Will energize R&amp;D party base, help turnout, reinforce polarization.
LarrySabato	698653129663971329	2016-02-13T23:41:01	There is no constitutional or statutory time limit on filling a Court vacancy. Politics determines how long a seat is empty.
LarrySabato	698652562296344576	2016-02-13T23:38:45	Only the hopelessly naive could believe that Obama and Senate R majority could reach agreement on a choice in prez election year.

LarrySabato	697225865218883584	2016-02-10T01:09:34	No way Hillary can declare herself the comeback kid. The Clinton coalition from 1992 and 2008 has collapsed.
LarrySabato	697225186765074432	2016-02-10T01:06:52	Trump wins in 2 ways--the victory itself and the traffic jam of his opponents. No one over 10% drops out. Precisely what Trump wants.
LarrySabato	697224585876533248	2016-02-10T01:04:29	A primary win confers legitimacy that no caucus can.

LarrySabato	696177858172030976	2016-02-07T03:45:10	Carson hurt Cruz on the Iowa "he's dropping out" dirty trick. The last 2 debates, Cruz has seemed off his game. Not sure it matters.
LarrySabato	696177398732210177	2016-02-07T03:43:20	The 3 GOVs did relatively well. Kasich may have gained most. Christie skinned Rubio; not sure how much it helped CC. Bush better than usual.

LarrySabato	696153601497030656	2016-02-07T02:08:47	Many people have asked me why debate audiences boo some candidates and cheer others. Now you know: Big $$ donors get loads of seats.

LarrySabato	696145733490237444	2016-02-07T01:37:31	Oh, Jeb Bush is still on the stage. And his time is used to go after Rubio.
LarrySabato	696145534965444610	2016-02-07T01:36:43	Congratulations to the RNC for sanctioning yet another debate that covers the stage with GOP candidates' blood. Brilliant strategy!
LarrySabato	696144876384157696	2016-02-07T01:34:06	Christie has really targeted Rubio. And something tells me Christie will have plenty of company. Marcomentum has a big cost for Rubio.
LarrySabato	696144400964046848	2016-02-07T01:32:13	So far, with the active aid of the questioners, GOP candidates have been sandbagging each other seriously enough to require hospitalization.

LarrySabato	694141190527012864	2016-02-01T12:52:10	LarrySabato canvassing this weekend met almost as many unable to vote due to old age, children, or work  as planning to vote. Embarrassing
LarrySabato	694140547427082240	2016-02-01T12:49:37	LarrySabato fwiw: I don't think it's a "model" but I do think it is an important part of the mix. Or at least, was: 
LarrySabato	694138442817671169	2016-02-01T12:41:15	This is so true. Saddest people I talked to while phone banking were elderly people who couldn't participate. 
LarrySabato	694137800426303488	2016-02-01T12:38:42	.LarrySabato Coverage of Iowa among the worst I can recall. Enormous focus on superficial posturing/insults. But: little candidate access
LarrySabato	694136278174928897	2016-02-01T12:32:39	Media touting IA caucus as model exercise in democracy. Bunk. Process excludes soldiers abroad, shut-in elderly, night-shift workers.
LarrySabato	693641855779655680	2016-01-31T03:48:00	Iowa GOP polls this week: All 7 have Trump up - by 5/7/8/4/7/7/2 Rubio btw 11-18, no sign of surge, maybe 2pt bump 
LarrySabato	693181973385383936	2016-01-29T21:20:35	So much of politics is luck. And on the Friday before the Monday IA caucuses, here's another big negative Hillary email story. Hmm.
LarrySabato	692932263428919297	2016-01-29T04:48:20	Crystal Ball: Who we see as modest favorites in Iowa - 
LarrySabato	692919716466331648	2016-01-29T03:58:28	No way did this change much. Worth watching, solid questioning. But it will always be remembered as "The Split-Screen Debate".
LarrySabato	692907602892738560	2016-01-29T03:10:20	Now it's a Rubio-Cruz clash on immigration. Both changed positions; neither can admit it.
LarrySabato	692906064237498368	2016-01-29T03:04:13	Bush-Rubio grudge match is on full display. Immigration is the spark tonight.
LarrySabato	692900244938338304	2016-01-29T02:41:06	The GOP candidate field appears so large it takes multiple networks to accommodate them!
LarrySabato	692899985596243968	2016-01-29T02:40:04	It's just bizarre--FOX has 7 GOP candidates, while Trump and 2 others (Huckabee, Santorum) are on another network right now!
LarrySabato	692899153278427137	2016-01-29T02:36:46	Why is this debate disorienting? Because we're so used to the elephant being in the room, not on a competing network.
LarrySabato	692898286475223041	2016-01-29T02:33:19	My guess is most people are doing what I'm doing: switching back &amp; forth. I'll bet some switch to Trump when a candidate they dislike is up.
LarrySabato	692897445475291137	2016-01-29T02:29:59	Trump announcing big sums for vets--some donors present. Totally noncontroversial.
LarrySabato	692897055363063808	2016-01-29T02:28:26	Visual contrast: Trump fills the stage, while the FOX seven together don't.
LarrySabato	692896431326175233	2016-01-29T02:25:57	Commercial breaks are dangerous. Trump's ratings just went up.
LarrySabato	692893706291007488	2016-01-29T02:15:07	Just once I'd like to see a candidate wear a yellow tie. Even a green one. But buy stock in red and blue.
LarrySabato	692893000058294272	2016-01-29T02:12:19	Rand the first to go after Cruz. Won't be the last. Wait until Ted and Marco clash...
LarrySabato	692892136132349953	2016-01-29T02:08:53	First fib of the night: Jeb Bush says he "kinda misses Donald Trump." Uh, not credible.
LarrySabato	692891783009685504	2016-01-29T02:07:29	Rubio attacks Obama, Hillary, not Trump.
LarrySabato	692891489492275200	2016-01-29T02:06:19	Cruz takes command at the outset, citing Trump insults but also praising Trump. Well, OK.
LarrySabato	692890919528345600	2016-01-29T02:04:03	FOX debate begins before Trump event. Anticipation...it's making me wait.

LarrySabato	692479048635793409	2016-01-27T22:47:25	Trump may be crazy, or he's crazy like a fox (FOX?). But so far he's outwitted the entire GOP establishment--not to mention his opponents.
LarrySabato	692478219719696384	2016-01-27T22:44:07	It's official! Trump's counter programming, at the site of our CBS News DemDebate in November... 
LarrySabato	692478235561594880	2016-01-27T22:44:11	So Trump's "special veterans event" begins precisely at 9 pm EST in Iowa tomorrow. Wait! That's the exact minute the FOX debate begins!
LarrySabato	692156600400887808	2016-01-27T01:26:07	Link 2 stories: Trump out of FOX debate &amp; Abe Vigoda from "The Godfather": "Tell Mike it was business not personal. I always liked him."
LarrySabato	691690163001561088	2016-01-25T18:32:40	The more I read about byzantine procedures in Iowa caucuses--and the games that are played--the more I favor across-the-board primaries.
LarrySabato	691669974989934592	2016-01-25T17:12:27	LarrySabato you can see TV dinner tables at Ike's Gettysburg Farm.  Mamie and the General would sit and eat in front of the boob tube..
LarrySabato	691665104929198081	2016-01-25T16:53:06	55 yrs ago tonight, 6 pm, my family ate Swanson TV dinners while watching 1st-ever live POTUS news conference. JFK wowed. (Thx Mike Allen)
LarrySabato	691340363760603136	2016-01-24T19:22:41	BobbieMitchell If D nominee is HRC, highly doubtful. Sanders as nominee, I could see it.
LarrySabato	691340062458511364	2016-01-24T19:21:30	armandodkos Not really. Anderson had a GOP voting record in House on most things. And in Nov. he took about equally from Carter &amp; Reagan.
LarrySabato	691339129251074049	2016-01-24T19:17:47	RichardJaussi Would I lie to you? Remember, I'm not running for anything.
LarrySabato	691338689109192704	2016-01-24T19:16:02	4/4 I know: Different era, big money, '16 nominees not in same league as Carter/Reagan match-up, etc. But Inds are usually overrated at 1st
LarrySabato	691337874353065984	2016-01-24T19:12:48	3/4 Then partisanship/polarization take over. Anderson tumbles to 7% in a few weeks. Wins no state, no EVs. Doesn't win a SINGLE pct in USA!
LarrySabato	691337213389463552	2016-01-24T19:10:10	2/4 Carter &amp; Reagan polarizing. Doesn't have a billion but media lavish free attention. Zooms to mid-20s. Becomes "the intelligent choice".
LarrySabato	691336780038172673	2016-01-24T19:08:27	1/4 If you forced me to make an imperfect comparison for Bloomberg, I'd choose Cong. John Anderson (1980). Leaves GOP to provide middle way.
LarrySabato	691336063755886593	2016-01-24T19:05:36	justinbarbour Yeah, very difficult to tell. But my instinct is that IA D is highly competitive--no runaway at all.
LarrySabato	691324766284861445	2016-01-24T18:20:43	this either means they're both right, or that this would happen one out of every four times at random 
LarrySabato	691324022429212673	2016-01-24T18:17:45	At last--two network polls released together agree (FOX &amp; CBS). Trump gained after big week, now leads Cruz in IA. Trump holds lead in NH.
LarrySabato	691065383336308736	2016-01-24T01:10:01	Don't you hope Bloomberg runs just so we can see creative "Big Gulp" TV ads? Eviscerating.
LarrySabato	691065028707921920	2016-01-24T01:08:36	RFDuPree HenryBarbour UVA It was good clean fun! Of course, a beer never hurt anyone if legal. I covered myself.
LarrySabato	691062584481562624	2016-01-24T00:58:54	jdh_dc You're dead wrong. I'm not even known in the East.

LarrySabato	691060687414661121	2016-01-24T00:51:21	DJH_2036 Yes, closer to the truth.
LarrySabato	691059655531991040	2016-01-24T00:47:15	JohnWilson Both. Forget early polls. In the end, most partisans won't abandon their nominees--certainly not enough to elect Bloomberg.
LarrySabato	691058352705634304	2016-01-24T00:42:05	jaybennett1234 Better idea: Invest it in the  UVA Center4Politics. Improve civic ed. And we'll name it after you.
LarrySabato	691057911867543552	2016-01-24T00:40:20	richgalen Then I'd assume the R would win. Excellent chance of 26 votes. Certainly won't be Bloomberg.
LarrySabato	691057424187445248	2016-01-24T00:38:23	mark28210 Bloomberg's views on social issues are very liberal. Almost no Rs will vote for him in the end.
LarrySabato	691057147392704513	2016-01-24T00:37:17	SyncPol I've been comparing it to 1860 if it turns out to be 4-way with 4 real players. But the D or R will win.
LarrySabato	691056631593984001	2016-01-24T00:35:14	eddie2003PRT Ballot access doable if he starts in March. His voter appeal is far more limited than he thinks.
LarrySabato	691056277238210560	2016-01-24T00:33:50	RickMoore You're probably right. But I think his run would encourage a 4th player from the mainstream non-Trump GOP. Complicated math.
LarrySabato	691055381443932160	2016-01-24T00:30:16	brianlange77 It won't be. And a "real Republican" mainstream conservative might run too.
LarrySabato	691054873513713664	2016-01-24T00:28:15	Democrats read Des Moines Register editorials. Republicans avoid them unless they want to get mad.
LarrySabato	691054036418760704	2016-01-24T00:24:56	Bloomberg says he'd spend a billion. He's worth $39b. He could spend it all and lose. 270 Electoral Votes not available to him.
LarrySabato	691053156034318336	2016-01-24T00:21:26	Mike Bloomberg's blooming interest is predictable. It won't work out the way he thinks. Far less demand for him than he imagines.
LarrySabato	690941454173261825	2016-01-23T16:57:34	MARKJDANIELS Last spring no one thought Trump would run since he'd tested the water for decades. At 73 this is Bloomberg's last chance.
LarrySabato	690766017849606144	2016-01-23T05:20:27	The inevitable, joyful, very loud, post-midnight snowball fight among hundreds of UVA students on the Lawn. 
LarrySabato	690761470381035520	2016-01-23T05:02:22	To think that wall-to-wall Trump coverage could be so easily replaced by a little snow. Unsettling.
LarrySabato	690290016917020676	2016-01-21T21:48:59	Go gaga over CNN/ORC Iowa poll. But sample of previous caucusgoers: Cruz 30, Trump 28, Rubio 16. Clinton 55, Sanders 38. All about turnout.
LarrySabato	690294471074975746	2016-01-21T22:06:41	Friday classes just cancelled UVA with big snow on way. And a cheer went up on the Lawn in a nanosecond. 'Good' news travels fast.

LarrySabato	689459013725978624	2016-01-19T14:46:53	LarrySabato it would be a even funnier if if was two Corinthians walked into a column. Don't think smh what a Doric!

LarrySabato	689456655596007425	2016-01-19T14:37:30	Recall Ricardo Montalban selling the Chrysler C√≥rdoba by pushing its "fine Corinthian leather". No such thing. Ad agency made it up.
LarrySabato	689455239108296704	2016-01-19T14:31:53	Give Trump a break on the Bible citation. He was actually just telling the old joke that begins, "Two Corinthians walk into a bar..."
LarrySabato	688933150416834560	2016-01-18T03:57:17	Nothing changed. Why would voters switch on the basis of this debate? Reinforced previous leanings perhaps.
LarrySabato	688931553855025152	2016-01-18T03:50:56	Really? O'Malley is at 2% and has had a much larger share of debate time already.
LarrySabato	688931195565010944	2016-01-18T03:49:31	It is in Hillary's interests to further define Bill's role in another Clinton White House. Voters naturally wonder about an ex-POTUS.
LarrySabato	688930452850274305	2016-01-18T03:46:34	Ah, the Bill Questions. Will be Bill of Fare as long as HRC is in the race.
LarrySabato	688920692969074689	2016-01-18T03:07:47	What? I must have switched over to the Cartoon Network.
LarrySabato	688916589136195584	2016-01-18T02:51:28	Young Dens are usually drawn to the candidate on the cutting edge--McGovern, Gary Hart, Howard Dean, Sanders. Electability arguments fail.
LarrySabato	688915440375099392	2016-01-18T02:46:55	Gov. O'Malley did indeed bring his state together...to elect a Republican to succeed him.
LarrySabato	688914887360311296	2016-01-18T02:44:43	It is naive to the Nth degree to believe any new POTUS will reverse the multi-decade trend of intense party polarization. .
LarrySabato	688911032954269697	2016-01-18T02:29:24	Worth remembering that the 3 Dems agree on 90%+ of everything, though you'd never know it by listening.

LarrySabato	688017699658674176	2016-01-15T15:19:37	Jeb must view SC as his safety net. Dubya bounced back after losing NH badly by destroying McCain in SC 2000. Doubtful history will repeat.

LarrySabato	687827090666852352	2016-01-15T02:42:12	I see Twitter has mainly concluded that Cruz won the match with Trump. How many Trump backers switched as a result? You don't need 2 hands.
LarrySabato	687824363530416128	2016-01-15T02:31:22	Cruz had an effective, well practiced answer on natural born citizenship.
