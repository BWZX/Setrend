LeslieShaffer1	710743987808636929	2016-03-18T08:25:46	GwilymMcGrew I didn't write it, but the headline is an accurate description.I see no reason to continue discussing if you haven't read it
LeslieShaffer1	710743606810652672	2016-03-18T08:24:15	GwilymMcGrew So enlighten me: why are crimes vs humanity, a race war, a ground war in the mideast and a wildly unbalance budget good waves?
LeslieShaffer1	710742745535545344	2016-03-18T08:20:50	GwilymMcGrew So what you're saying is, you didn't read the article before commenting.
LeslieShaffer1	710742583949918208	2016-03-18T08:20:11	GwilymMcGrew Trump is a failed businessman with a spotty legal history; he's shown zero knowledge of political policy, foreign or domestic
LeslieShaffer1	710742132244361216	2016-03-18T08:18:23	GwilymMcGrew If Trump starts all the wars he's promised on the campaign trail, it very well may be the end.
LeslieShaffer1	710741429337718784	2016-03-18T08:15:36	GwilymMcGrew The Economist is actually British. And it isn't known for being liberal. You haven't read the article, have you?

LeslieShaffer1	710739419351769089	2016-03-18T08:07:37	GwilymMcGrew In fact, I'm intrigued why you wouldn't think Trump's planned policies wouldn't be considered a major geopolitical risk
LeslieShaffer1	710739203454140417	2016-03-18T08:06:45	GwilymMcGrew Reagan didn't ride to power promising a race war,a Mideast ground war, crimes against humanity and extreme ignorance on policy
LeslieShaffer1	710731717208739841	2016-03-18T07:37:00	GwilymMcGrew It's actually extremely reputable. A Trump presidency is, in fact, widely considered an economic and geopolitical risk
