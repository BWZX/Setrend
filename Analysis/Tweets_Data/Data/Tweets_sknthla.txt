sknthla	725940937810038785	2016-04-29T06:53:01	Aakash1026 was referring to this 
sknthla	725940665310318592	2016-04-29T06:51:56	alexjc That's not it - was referring to this recent finding Productivity growth follows job growth after recession 
sknthla	725938927555645440	2016-04-29T06:45:02	My preferred explanations for slow productivity growth: 1. it's cyclical, comes from upward wage pressure, 2. it's related to urban housing

sknthla	725915883818774529	2016-04-29T05:13:28	Look at the replies to this thread - it's mostly filled with mean, patronizing stuff. This is why so many clever people just don't make it
sknthla	725915609809047556	2016-04-29T05:12:22	I think people misunderstand small town nerds, and confuse them for run-off-the-mill lucky people who were just really talented at school
sknthla	725914890502692864	2016-04-29T05:09:31	So if they don't preserve the self-image - they face the possibility the people back home were right about all those ideas they dislike
sknthla	725914072965779456	2016-04-29T05:06:16	a) is harder because there are lots of issues at play. Small town nerds defy convention - and use intelligence as a justification for why
sknthla	725913580843855872	2016-04-29T05:04:19	b) is straightforward for the small town nerd - make strong relationships to draw on in hard times (that most ppl have since childhood)
sknthla	725912984308998145	2016-04-29T05:01:56	(Luckily not me - but I got quite close.) The reason they nerds quit, is because a) they're scared b) they have little social support
sknthla	725912402760323076	2016-04-29T04:59:38	There's very little infrastructure/ support systems in place to stop these people quitting. And it's not taken very seriously as a problem.
sknthla	725912102200733697	2016-04-29T04:58:26	Common pattern: nerd from small town goes to college, has never had real competition before, ends up opting out of intellectualism entirely

sknthla	715393317563793408	2016-03-31T04:20:32	narenbalaji the US is weird, because new societies based on a revolutionary ideology rarely ever work (see: French revolution Burke)

sknthla	709981694082809856	2016-03-16T05:56:41	Important q - with deep learning, we don't know the internal process how the computer comes to it's conclusions, so how do we debug it?
sknthla	709979954457485313	2016-03-16T05:49:46	The way they present it is not in terms of learning prior distributions - but about changing the binary unit of a computer to a fuzzy one

sknthla	709961518637563905	2016-03-16T04:36:31	CalebWatney j_tkronk if the realignment is as we're describing, dems will win landslides for a long time - demographic trends exacerbated
sknthla	709960320358486017	2016-03-16T04:31:45	CalebWatney j_tkronk yeah -religious Western states e.g. Utah just do not go for him at all. and they're well-educated, unlike some places
sknthla	709959467710992384	2016-03-16T04:28:22	CalebWatney j_tkronk lol or might just go Dem for social issues anyway
sknthla	709958767765540864	2016-03-16T04:25:35	CalebWatney j_tkronk wonder where the Sanders crew will go to though (educated left leaning millenials) Perhaps theyre not important
sknthla	709958018939686913	2016-03-16T04:22:36	Also - I've followed US politics since way before I moved here. It's really interesting to see how the experiment in anarchy worked out :D
sknthla	709957586402021376	2016-03-16T04:20:53	CalebWatney j_tkronk Dems going pro-market I think is the wishful thinking part important part of their coalition is the ex-union types
sknthla	709956678494588928	2016-03-16T04:17:17	CalebWatney j_tkronk one way to look at it is the Dems represent the Hamiltonian vision, the more centralized, "grand empire" America
sknthla	709954739052658688	2016-03-16T04:09:34	CalebWatney e.g. the republicans haven't thought up an alternative way of doing universal healthcare - too busy with conspiracy theories
sknthla	709954541874089984	2016-03-16T04:08:47	CalebWatney first thought with this video - there *are* ideas that don't get considered! most notably, sane &amp; nice free-market ideas
sknthla	709953149331615744	2016-03-16T04:03:15	CalebWatney I can totally see a third party dying pretty easily, doesn't mean it can't form in the meantime
sknthla	709952956049727488	2016-03-16T04:02:29	CalebWatney the way scotland is similar to the far west states is - they dont really identify much w/ government  anyway
sknthla	709952439584075776	2016-03-16T04:00:26	CalebWatney concede that polarization in the UK is way less extreme but - scottish nationalists really hate the conservative party
sknthla	709951910938161152	2016-03-16T03:58:20	CalebWatney right - they rose after scotland lost it's independence referendum. otoh,its not like the US doesn't have secession movements..
sknthla	709951483601494016	2016-03-16T03:56:38	qrendel hmmm. not sure I buy it. where do the trump voters go?
sknthla	709951171780169728	2016-03-16T03:55:24	CalebWatney maybe but - I think a parlimintary system makes fear of your 3rd choice party worse. bc they have more power, less obstruction
sknthla	709950109505564672	2016-03-16T03:51:10	CalebWatney (was Labour + Conservative, now Labour + Scottish Nationalists + Conservative)
sknthla	709949981621268480	2016-03-16T03:50:40	CalebWatney counterpoint - the UK was a two party system due to FPTP for many years - after geographical fragmentation, is now 3-party
sknthla	709949096883138562	2016-03-16T03:47:09	CalebWatney not so sure - FPTP creates big parties bc supporters are in theory not geographically concentrated.
sknthla	709948162392240129	2016-03-16T03:43:26	US politics geeks: if there is a new third party, who will the coalition be? Seems the most underrepresented people are in the far West
