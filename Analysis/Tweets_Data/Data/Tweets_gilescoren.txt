gilescoren	704617699213746176	2016-03-01T10:42:05	john_boyne It's clear my tweet sounded bad to you. 140 characters can be clumsy. So can 100,000 words. I'm better off somewhere in between.
gilescoren	704613529345724416	2016-03-01T10:25:31	john_boyne After all, I chose to make a film mocking myself remorselessly and cruelly - I'm hardly going to attack my mockers, him or you.
gilescoren	704612343360167936	2016-03-01T10:20:48	john_boyne and he's a 'reader', there was pretty obvious ironic context with me responding to on-screen criticism with mock dudgeon.
gilescoren	704612156382318593	2016-03-01T10:20:03	john_boyne Why would he see it? I doubt he's on Twitter. I doubt he follows me. It wasn't a general tweet. You'd have to be looking hard.

gilescoren	688411399228358656	2016-01-16T17:24:02	ejhchess LizTray yes, unless you're an idiot. They're just on my timeline. New to Twitter old chap?
gilescoren	688400758706974721	2016-01-16T16:41:45	LizTray because hundreds of people tweeted to thank me for writing what they'd been thinking all week.

gilescoren	688392518917033990	2016-01-16T16:09:00	LizTray hang on. You're a "Bowie fan girl" and an "idiot optimist"? Well then of course you don't understand why I wrote it.
gilescoren	688392103236386816	2016-01-16T16:07:21	LizTray not at all. I positively need people to disagree to get the traction that feeds the clicks that gets the advertising that pays me.
gilescoren	688391611701661697	2016-01-16T16:05:24	LizTray but you're a proof-reader. And you took from it that "dislike Bowie"?

gilescoren	688388173685239810	2016-01-16T15:51:44	LizTray you haven't read the piece have you?
gilescoren	688387528555126784	2016-01-16T15:49:11	LizTray the ones who agreed with me are about 85% so quite a majority. And writing about food is quite a small part of my work.

gilescoren	684708610430119936	2016-01-06T12:10:28	Right, I have cashed out my bet on South Africa because I want to want England to survive. Patriotism and capitalism in perfect harmony.
gilescoren	684686538056175616	2016-01-06T10:42:46	Will_Lyons richardosman I meant South Africa very long. England I've got long for a 4-0 win from the first test but not long enough...
gilescoren	684686134732009472	2016-01-06T10:41:10	Will_Lyons richardosman well, I've got england very long from day two and I've decided not to cash out at any stage, just for the thrill.
gilescoren	684683109594468352	2016-01-06T10:29:08	Bloody hell. South Africa might just do this. Can't see Stokes et al blocking out two sessions. There might be some cricket here yet.

gilescoren	684056102523301889	2016-01-04T16:57:38	Got a PR email about a new Chinese hotpot restaurant called Shuang Shuang. Googled it for info. The 'images' option was certainly revealing.

gilescoren	683576526906998784	2016-01-03T09:11:58	edcaesar also I found him a bit annoying this morning, whanging on about how only he tells the truth about the game (true though it may be)
gilescoren	683576310967463936	2016-01-03T09:11:07	edcaesar I did the first couple of overs on the radio while making a cup of tea but it sounded like something I had to SEE.
gilescoren	683574597829132288	2016-01-03T09:04:18	If you're lying there poking your phone get UP and go and look at Ben Stokes, the new King Arthur, slaying South Africa with his Excalibur.
gilescoren	683568421758439424	2016-01-03T08:39:46	track_10 there have been setbacks but now a decent chance of it happening on, I believe, the Cooking Channel.
gilescoren	683567772555677696	2016-01-03T08:37:11	Baroquette I have. I think it's still very decent dim sum. Possibly doesn't live up to the hyperbole of that review.
