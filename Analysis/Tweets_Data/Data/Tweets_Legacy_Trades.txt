Legacy_Trades	688084108132618240	2016-01-15T19:43:30	Legacy_Trades NOT QUITE - No new high in Q415 but we're plummeting, as expected, in Q116. Plenty more downside to come throughout the year.
Legacy_Trades	682657948229844993	2015-12-31T20:21:52	THANK YOU - We've received several DM's, emails, etc. in the past couple months filled with kind thoughts &amp; well wishes. Read &amp; appreciated.
Legacy_Trades	682657527843176448	2015-12-31T20:20:12	GOODBYE 2015 - We close '15 with a loss, our second since opening the doors in '98. Disappointing &amp; motivating all the same. Happy New Year.
Legacy_Trades	651955432878161921	2015-10-08T03:01:02	THE KING IS BACK - NHL: As a devoted CAPS fan it's great to have hockey back but tough to admit NYR Henrik The King looked great tonight.
Legacy_Trades	649375648893566976	2015-10-01T00:09:54	EYE SPY: One Day Wonder - Nothing more than a Q end push before we resume lower. See 1940 capping upside &amp; 1827- is the Q4 downside target.
Legacy_Trades	644587980087275520	2015-09-17T19:05:24	OUR GUESS - SPY makes new highs in '15 &amp; then we crash in '16 (new POTUS + weak economy + overvalued SPY + rate hikes) just like '00 &amp; '08.

Legacy_Trades	639074209889710080	2015-09-02T13:55:39	EYE SPY: Another big EPS loss for NAV. Cost cuts won't outpace lower truck sales as the peak replacement cycle has past. Destination: BK.
Legacy_Trades	639069015676178432	2015-09-02T13:35:01	RIP - Al Arbour; first class ambassador for the NHL &amp; largely responsible for the Islanders "dynasty years."
Legacy_Trades	636284709996232704	2015-08-25T21:11:11	EYE SPY - Pointless opinion of the day (but one you can profit from); the S&amp;P 1820 level ain't gonna hold. Wake yourself up @ 1680 instead.
Legacy_Trades	635880665398013952	2015-08-24T18:25:39	EYE SPY - Not that SPY targets matter, as we buy indie stocks, our general interest in redeploying $ on the L: side comes @ $130 a $150.
Legacy_Trades	635877764311162881	2015-08-24T18:14:07	EYE SPY - Overreaction @ the open but a revisit to early a/m levels (&amp; lower) looms. No interest here until SPY fPE in the 9x - 12x range.
Legacy_Trades	634819672957943809	2015-08-21T20:09:39	EYE SPY - TVTraders say China may intervene this weekend, SPY action is capitulative &amp; we bounce big Monday yet those traders ain't buyin'
Legacy_Trades	634512679412047872	2015-08-20T23:49:46	EYE SPY - Today is but a minor blip - a start - relative to the bigger picture. SPY seeks much lower.
Legacy_Trades	631678679945449472	2015-08-13T04:08:27	iBUYS - Remain flat in '15 (read: the smart $, yo), yet we'd buy UPLD, CAS, GARS, OESX, ISNS, &amp; JASN for 5 - 18 months. GetEmNowSon

Legacy_Trades	601781644303949824	2015-05-22T16:08:19	INSIDER MOVE - WST: No interest in the broad market but a notable CEO buy here; low beta, easy read TA, attractive sector &amp; very solid FA.

Legacy_Trades	596393130229932032	2015-05-07T19:16:17	FA + TA = XCRA: Little discussed Semi w/ nice FA &amp; fwd forecast had a nice run from Feb to late Apr. Orderly p/b makes 9 - 9.50 interesting
Legacy_Trades	595933280769339392	2015-05-06T12:49:00	UNDERVALUED - RDC: Out of favor sector but nice top &amp; bottom line #'s at RDC. Name looks ridiculously cheap on FA, which is why we own it.
