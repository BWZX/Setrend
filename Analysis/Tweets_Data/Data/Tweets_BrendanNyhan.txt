BrendanNyhan	709923383585144834	2016-03-16T02:04:59	Trump is standing on stage with one person who allegedly attacked a journalist and another who publicly praised an assault on a protester.
BrendanNyhan	709924535802458112	2016-03-16T02:09:33	Agree - can't be sure of anything w/Trump in the race, but I think caution about early trial heats still justified

BrendanNyhan	709907421758676992	2016-03-16T01:01:33	But...but...what about the Kasich to the rescue columns everyone has ready to go? Surely they trump math.

BrendanNyhan	709178848705961985	2016-03-14T00:46:28	We're looking over the precipice and I mostly hear crickets. Trump could be on his way toward the GOP nomination after *Tuesday* night
BrendanNyhan	709178134692814848	2016-03-14T00:43:37	We may narrowly avert disaster per below but even if we do, no one should congratulate themselves on a great victory 
BrendanNyhan	709177611914764289	2016-03-14T00:41:33	I honestly thought our institutions were more robust to a Trump-like figure &amp; that others in public life were more committed to dem. norms
BrendanNyhan	709176531533299712	2016-03-14T00:37:15	We can sort through root causes later. Here's where we are: Someone could capture a major party nom who endorses violence &amp; few seem alarmed
BrendanNyhan	709175076181176320	2016-03-14T00:31:28	No one person or institution is at fault for Trump. Everyone has their favorite monocausal explanation. They're all incomplete.
BrendanNyhan	709174759989383168	2016-03-14T00:30:13	These norms are fragile precisely because, per emilythorson, they are not formal or legal. And they are hard to restore once breached.
BrendanNyhan	709174488349478912	2016-03-14T00:29:08	Shockingly few public figures and elites are defending the norms of public debate and restraint from violence that Trump is bulldozing.
BrendanNyhan	709174152582860802	2016-03-14T00:27:48	Trump's rise represents a failure in American parties, media, and civic institutions - and they're continuing to fail right now
BrendanNyhan	709173808117190657	2016-03-14T00:26:26	That's why I'm dubious about all the root cause psychologizing - where's data showing economic anxiety or racial hatred is that much higher?
BrendanNyhan	709173444596912129	2016-03-14T00:24:59	People's vulnerability to Trump-like figure hasn't changed. What changed is that the institutions of Am. govt./party system legitimized one
BrendanNyhan	709173094506741760	2016-03-14T00:23:36	Sadly, we've known for decades that a subset of people have authoritarian tendencies and that hatred toward outgroups is often widespread
BrendanNyhan	709172904194396160	2016-03-14T00:22:50	At this point, I'm less outraged/surprised by the extent of Trump's public support than the passivity and acquiescence of so many elites

BrendanNyhan	708693015943102465	2016-03-12T16:35:56	Again, shutting down rallies can fuel a backlash - looks like illiberalism on both sides. Peaceful protest best.

BrendanNyhan	705041419581325312	2016-03-02T14:45:48	Absolutely right. It's one thing to not force Trump from the race. If you can't force Kasich out you're not trying.

BrendanNyhan	702603625944772608	2016-02-24T21:18:52	@seththoughts but see DavMicRot (who prob. has further thoughts) on why backing out cond probs can be problematic 
BrendanNyhan	702602589939109888	2016-02-24T21:14:45	jpdig right exactly - was about to make this point re: variance
BrendanNyhan	702602492174016516	2016-02-24T21:14:22	We don't know what to expect! (Also, as always with presidential elections, candidate characteristics tend to matter less than people think)
BrendanNyhan	702602360569384960	2016-02-24T21:13:51	My view is expected value might be -1 or -2 percentage points versus Rubio but Trump is most distinctive in being high variance
BrendanNyhan	702602172643602432	2016-02-24T21:13:06	Not after Iowa! See them flipping Feb. 1; presidential party market stays flat 
BrendanNyhan	702601759785668608	2016-02-24T21:11:27	If he hurts GOP, party fortunes should vary with his, but largely flat. More consistent with the view that he's not as bad as many think

BrendanNyhan	702497077616517120	2016-02-24T14:15:29	If Trump is the inevitable nominee, we should expect officeholders to endorse. They haven't.

BrendanNyhan	702510731095371776	2016-02-24T15:09:44	RyanDEnos blfraga voxdotcom I'd put different way. We have few predictive theories about primary outcomes so filled void publicly
BrendanNyhan	702509218650320896	2016-02-24T15:03:44	EricaGrieder jimtankersley historically the evidence is w/jim. VP is often (not always) frontrunner, though small sample caveats apply.
BrendanNyhan	702500408967753728	2016-02-24T14:28:43	jimtankersley EricaGrieder i think the Trump is somewhat more electable than Cruz case is plausible if he doesn't draw 3rd party challenge
BrendanNyhan	702500241539506177	2016-02-24T14:28:04	jimtankersley EricaGrieder no idea. can only say what they should see.
BrendanNyhan	702498616733208576	2016-02-24T14:21:36	jimtankersley Yeah, I've had same thought - Jonah Goldberg floated that on NRO. More will suggest.
BrendanNyhan	702498386390491136	2016-02-24T14:20:41	jimtankersley So Cruz has stronger incentive to stay in, which helps Trump. Leaving would help Rubio &amp; thereby reduce Cruz's chance in 2020
BrendanNyhan	702497928838057984	2016-02-24T14:18:52	jimtankersley Rubio is clearly in 2nd &amp; faces two risky general elec candidates, whereas Cruz faces a stronger (Rubio) &amp; weaker one (Trump)
BrendanNyhan	702497471977619457	2016-02-24T14:17:03	jimtankersley many in GOP think Cruz is less electable than Trump so I think your theory doesn't apply as well to Rubio
BrendanNyhan	702497199087865857	2016-02-24T14:15:58	jimtankersley in other words, Cruz has even less incentive to drop out than Rubio because Rubio is a stronger candidate in the general
BrendanNyhan	702495489229508609	2016-02-24T14:09:11	Are Marco Rubio and Bernie Sanders playing to win? Their actions, strategies suggest they're not. 
BrendanNyhan	702495646197161986	2016-02-24T14:09:48	jimtankersley not sure it's symmetric though. cruz should worry about rubio winning more than the converse (though not clear he does)
BrendanNyhan	702494910851768321	2016-02-24T14:06:53	jimtankersley OK, so you're saying on probability of dropping out. I'm thinking of prob. attacking Trump
BrendanNyhan	702494429916045312	2016-02-24T14:04:58	jimtankersley Isn't that the opposite of your logic above? I'm confused now.
