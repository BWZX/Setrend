bengoldacre	686584225953374208	2016-01-11T16:23:30	LawDavF it seems to me that one very significant strategic downside of our military adventures this century is that they’ve made us hated.
bengoldacre	686582428236922884	2016-01-11T16:16:21	LawDavF well, i agree that no political thought seems to have gone into them. better to call them “sorry last resort” or “AC61/3b” missiles
bengoldacre	686580630361092096	2016-01-11T16:09:12	LawDavF seems unhelpful to play into that by using biblical names for the weapons we use on such crusades. and the names buy us nothing.
bengoldacre	686580369701875712	2016-01-11T16:08:10	LawDavF  sure but the popular narrative in many parts of the world is that our bombing has a crusade-y feel to it.
bengoldacre	686573006848692224	2016-01-11T15:38:55	LawDavF it’s good. i’m big on structure in non fic, both the big themes and small eddies, but tbh i don’t meet my own high standards.
bengoldacre	686572696289820672	2016-01-11T15:37:41	LawDavF an old testament name, when used against islamic nations, seems needlessly crass, provocative, and unwise to me. but hey!

bengoldacre	686521360022147073	2016-01-11T12:13:41	Yes, but: pseudo-debunking and debunking often both consumed by ppl who lack skills to debunk a claim in a field. 
bengoldacre	686520837709639680	2016-01-11T12:11:37	KakesKaty well quite. that’s the interesting issue i think.
bengoldacre	686517696977043456	2016-01-11T11:59:08	Anyway, guess I need to write something longer on pseudo-debunking. I think it’s interesting, and new, ish, in its more prevalent state.
bengoldacre	686517419939131392	2016-01-11T11:58:02	… that raises further issues. Readers/consumers want to use them as shortcuts, and that’s in essence the value of such work.
bengoldacre	686517168083726336	2016-01-11T11:57:02	Yes, but this may mean the consumers of such “debunking” need to be as sophisticated as the producers. Now... 
bengoldacre	686515952020774912	2016-01-11T11:52:12	Yes, that’s one key question for any pseudo-debunking: are the shortcomings identified germane to the overall issue?

bengoldacre	686515443784400896	2016-01-11T11:50:11	alexhern i think there will almost always be some trivial shortcomings in any piece, paper, report, etc. To debag those is no prize.
bengoldacre	686515205111705601	2016-01-11T11:49:14	Essentially I am saying that public discussion on evidence has shifted up a level, and pseudo-debunking is now a thing. More than before.

bengoldacre	686513753098207232	2016-01-11T11:43:28	Yes, all too common now to read a series of triumphant rebuttals to the trivial shortcomings in a piece / argument.

bengoldacre	686513101693403136	2016-01-11T11:40:52	This produces a pseudo-debunking, with the feeling tone and “scienciness" of a serious thoughtful analysis. To applause from supporters...

bengoldacre	686512440905957376	2016-01-11T11:38:15	The dominant feature of this pseudodebunking is: a flamboyantly detailed discussion of small methodological shortcomings in the evidence...
bengoldacre	686511608743510016	2016-01-11T11:34:56	I’m sure that’s right. And arguably, perhaps, in corners of the pre-internet medical literature.  
bengoldacre	686511359517962240	2016-01-11T11:33:57	I suppose this was inevitable side effect of wider access to publishing platforms and thirst for knowledge, benefits &gt; hazards. Still, tho.
