MorningEdition	701826790105477120	2016-02-22T17:52:00	What questions about the news would you like answered tomorrow on Morning Edition? We're listening.
MorningEdition	701804256085590016	2016-02-22T16:22:28	Thoughts on how else the film/TV industry can become more inclusive?
MorningEdition	701801982030381056	2016-02-22T16:13:26	The USCAnnenberg report on film/TV diversity offers some recommendations for creating a more inclusive industry: 
MorningEdition	701800991742697473	2016-02-22T16:09:29	Again, you can read USCAnnenberg report here:  Its researchers call film industry a "straight, white, boy’s club."
MorningEdition	701800469602107392	2016-02-22T16:07:25	Another trend we're seeing in USCAnnenberg charts: on screen, women are included more often. But not fully included in writing/directing.
MorningEdition	701798811769954306	2016-02-22T16:00:50	Which makes us think: what about diversity in film/TV representation beyond just one axis of identity (ie why race OR gender OR sexuality?)
MorningEdition	701797955855110144	2016-02-22T15:57:26	.USCAnnenberg also found that ~72% of LGBT movie/TV characters were male; the majority of LGBT characters were also white HollywoodSoWhite
MorningEdition	701788533393068032	2016-02-22T15:19:59	Beyond the underrepresentation of minorities on screen, what about the lack of diverse narratives? 
MorningEdition	701786768719355905	2016-02-22T15:12:58	More than half of the films/TV shows USCAnnenberg researchers examined feature no Asian/Asian-American characters. 
MorningEdition	701786109211189249	2016-02-22T15:10:21	And even when women were given speaking roles, USCAnnenberg researchers found those roles were often sexualized: 
MorningEdition	701785429247401985	2016-02-22T15:07:39	Women make up just over half the U.S. population, but only one-third of speaking characters on the 414 films/TV shows USCAnnenberg analyzed
MorningEdition	701785113030430720	2016-02-22T15:06:24	This stat (only ~28% underrepresented minorities are speaking characters) is important because people of color are ~40% of the population.

MorningEdition	694181257635323905	2016-02-01T15:31:23	Indeed, my colleague titonka got into some alternative ideas:  goodreads 
MorningEdition	694179667146903556	2016-02-01T15:25:04	1/ It's not bad to be diverse, but our goal was to find a microcosm of the US demographically.  
MorningEdition	694178633066348544	2016-02-01T15:20:57	But, some would say CA and FL are overly diverse. And, don't really look like a microcosm of America either!  
MorningEdition	694179654782029824	2016-02-01T15:25:01	Want to see how your state compares, demographically, to the U.S. average or "mainstream"? See the rankings here: 
MorningEdition	694178500144660480	2016-02-01T15:20:26	.44621200 MorningEdition The 65+ population loyally votes. But, as the US changes, the Q is - does NH represent mainstream America?
MorningEdition	694178110577758208	2016-02-01T15:18:53	Oh dear, no, that's not what we're saying. NH is a great predictor of how that particular population votes 
MorningEdition	694177705139503104	2016-02-01T15:17:16	The demographer BrookingsInst  told me that maybe in time the rest of the country will end up looking more like Illinois
MorningEdition	694177593692651521	2016-02-01T15:16:50	2/ .MorningEdition So, as the country changes, will the results of Iowa and NH be as helpful in determining the nominee. Maybe that's the Q
MorningEdition	694177376146694144	2016-02-01T15:15:58	1/ .MorningEdition The under age-5 population in the country is already majority-minority (racially)
MorningEdition	694176987578003457	2016-02-01T15:14:25	That's tricky! The contest moves on to other states like SC (but, that's also not really representative of the US) 
MorningEdition	694176113069801472	2016-02-01T15:10:57	Our findings show NH is too gray, too secular, too white, too wealthy, and too educated!
MorningEdition	694176431543324674	2016-02-01T15:12:13	In the Perfect State Index, NH finished in 49th place. Only one other state did worse (West Virginia).
MorningEdition	694176633142562817	2016-02-01T15:13:01	.asmamk Ultimately, does it matter that states like Iowa and N.H. are first to vote even though they are not so representative of the U.S.?
MorningEdition	694175782948753409	2016-02-01T15:09:38	Not at all! Where Iowa does well in some measures (think: income and religion), NH did poorly in every category.  
MorningEdition	694175560449286144	2016-02-01T15:08:45	4/ A sort of comic tragedy that the Perfect State borders in fact borders Iowa along its western edge!
MorningEdition	694175429343735810	2016-02-01T15:08:14	.asmamk Even though Iowa’s demography isn’t very representative of the U.S. overall, is New Hampshire, the 2nd state to vote, any better?
MorningEdition	694174931697975296	2016-02-01T15:06:15	1/ To be fair, a number of states in the American heartland (I say this as a proud native midwesterner) did well on the Perfect State Index
MorningEdition	694174738898378753	2016-02-01T15:05:29	IL did very well on just about every metric (age, religion, race, education, income). It was in the top 10 for three of those categories.
MorningEdition	694174419510530049	2016-02-01T15:04:13	Spoke with a demographer BrookingsInst about IL, and he says Illinois (Chicago particularly) has mirrored the country's mass migrations
MorningEdition	694174236630450176	2016-02-01T15:03:29	.asmamk Illinois ranked #1 on your Perfect State Index. What about that state makes it so representative of the U.S. on average?
MorningEdition	694173954446114816	2016-02-01T15:02:22	Again, here's our map that shows how both very diverse states and very not-diverse states did equally poorly. 
MorningEdition	694173484138758144	2016-02-01T15:00:30	We were trying to find the state that was essentially a carbon copy of the US racially. And, Illinois was that state.
MorningEdition	694173014414467072	2016-02-01T14:58:38	Some states like California (38.5% white not hispanic) also didn't do well because they were too diverse compared to the country as a whole!
MorningEdition	694172546107838464	2016-02-01T14:56:46	Other thing about race - we looked at all the Census subgroups. So, states like SC (with large black populations) also didn't do well.
MorningEdition	694172034549547009	2016-02-01T14:54:44	.MorningEdition So, Iowa is 87.1% white (not hispanic). The US as a whole is 62.1% white (not Hispanic) according to Census data
MorningEdition	694171247698116608	2016-02-01T14:51:37	This map of the U.S. shows a clearer picture of how mainstream Iowa is when it comes to religiosity 
MorningEdition	694170339476140033	2016-02-01T14:48:00	.MorningEdition During caucus season we hear so much about courting evangelicals. But, there are many states far more religious than Iowa.
MorningEdition	694170840246673408	2016-02-01T14:50:00	.asmamk Why does Iowa rank so low in terms of race as a demographic factor when it's compared to the makeup of the mainstream U.S.?
MorningEdition	694169126470840321	2016-02-01T14:43:11	One issue is primary electorates often look nothing like the state. Representative state != representative primary. 
MorningEdition	694169497545134080	2016-02-01T14:44:39	.MorningEdition The one category Iowa didn't do so well on was race. It came in 40th place.
MorningEdition	694169014558461952	2016-02-01T14:42:44	. MorningEdition Overall, on our Perfect State Index, Iowa finished 16. Not bad, all things considered.
MorningEdition	694168864314298368	2016-02-01T14:42:08	.MorningEdition So, Iowa was near perfectly "average" in a couple of categories: income and religion
MorningEdition	694168678032629760	2016-02-01T14:41:24	. asmamk Very cool. So 5 categories total. In which demographic categories was Iowa the most similar to the U.S. as a whole?
MorningEdition	694168172342185984	2016-02-01T14:39:23	.MorningEdition Here's the heat map of how each state fared by income 
MorningEdition	694167647626399744	2016-02-01T14:37:18	For income we looked at the median household income in each state (which is tricky cause there's lots of econ indicators we could have used)
MorningEdition	694167367539101696	2016-02-01T14:36:12	.MorningEdition We measured education by looking at the % of people 25+ with a bachelor's degree or higher.
MorningEdition	694167229131264001	2016-02-01T14:35:39	.MorningEdition race, age, education, income, religion. All (but religion) came from Census Data. Religion info came from pewresearch

MorningEdition	694166716251791360	2016-02-01T14:33:36	.MorningEdition The other thing about Iowa (beyond being first) is that it's powerful, it has the potential to weed out candidates.
MorningEdition	694166366157430784	2016-02-01T14:32:13	.MorningEdition There's so much focus on Iowa (as you can tell by listening to the news!) So, we wanted to understand what that represents

MorningEdition	694156823524462592	2016-02-01T13:54:18	Remember, when we say "Perfect State Index," if a state is say a #1 or #2 it means it's more demographically representative of the U.S.
MorningEdition	694156229380313090	2016-02-01T13:51:56	Considering these factors, asmamk worked w/ a BrookingsInst demographer to create a "Perfect State Index." Iowa came in 16th place overall
MorningEdition	694153216808845312	2016-02-01T13:39:58	.asmamk looked at five categories to explore which states are representative of the U.S.: race, education, age, income and religion.

MorningEdition	694109655933546497	2016-02-01T10:46:52	Iowa became first in the nation for the presidential nomination process, in part, because its process was so long it needed the extra time.
