kdrum	698970968019050496	2016-02-14T20:43:59	MattBruenig Then difference is somewhere else. CPS figures much smaller than Moffit's. Revised poverty figures show it even less.
kdrum	698970624815984640	2016-02-14T20:42:37	MattBruenig It's obviously something we could fund easily. There's just disagreement about whether we should.
kdrum	698970483304349696	2016-02-14T20:42:04	MattBruenig Again, no argument that cash assistance to poorest has declined. But it's relatively small in overall picture.
kdrum	698970328584888321	2016-02-14T20:41:27	MattBruenig Moffitt doesn't include Medicaid, I think. That probably accounts for some of the difference.
kdrum	698962684818165760	2016-02-14T20:11:04	MattBruenig I don't deny that cash payments to very poor have declined. But overall, change has been very small.
kdrum	698961844120248321	2016-02-14T20:07:44	MattBruenig From 1999-2006 (recession trough-to-trough) went up from 4.7% to 5.2%. It's up, but certainly not a "spike."
kdrum	698961416368291840	2016-02-14T20:06:02	MattBruenig That's just not what Census data shows.  From 1993-2011 (recession peak-peak) went up from 6.2% to 6.6%.
