IncomeTrader	710255078125375488	2016-03-17T00:03:01	ektrit yup but once again, until then...
IncomeTrader	710254741763166209	2016-03-17T00:01:40	ektrit US mostly, outside of some stocks the TSX is much better
IncomeTrader	710254594090147840	2016-03-17T00:01:05	ektrit that's the key, you need a waterfall to start the unwind and an unwind to start the waterfall - otherwise TINA keeps people in

IncomeTrader	710251487570501632	2016-03-16T23:48:45	ektrit people will when it happens, we'll feel scared, small and petty as we should
IncomeTrader	710250923168116736	2016-03-16T23:46:30	ektrit we need a new adversary to unite the planet, we still think we're alone and it creates arrogance
IncomeTrader	710249897564372993	2016-03-16T23:42:26	ektrit best hope I see is some sort of Interplanetary colonization to fuel the next big growth but NASA's warp drive proj is difficult tech
IncomeTrader	710249314660945921	2016-03-16T23:40:07	ektrit capitalism is not designed for it nor the world population topping out in 2050 and economy stops growing out of debt
IncomeTrader	710248632293810176	2016-03-16T23:37:24	ektrit eventually anyone not a decision maker or professional won't be able to get a job, interesting to see how economy handles it
IncomeTrader	710248133280661504	2016-03-16T23:35:25	ektrit we're running out of cheap emerging market labour, it's the next step - eventually a Wall-E future will develop
IncomeTrader	710247763846430720	2016-03-16T23:33:57	ektrit you're too far ahead - factory worker jobs are already largely displaced, more and more mindless jobs will disappear - take decades

IncomeTrader	710103219075035136	2016-03-16T13:59:35	fraserrc yeah, I think minimum was around $1100/mth total so between that and claw backs if you are doing well it's not that great
