Econ_Marshall	719945683965448192	2016-04-12T17:50:01	ModeledBehavior So in your view consumer welfare is the only "economic" criterion? Low prices always dominate high prices?

Econ_Marshall	719941236099059714	2016-04-12T17:32:21	endtheblackout Also, the economic argument in favor is nonsense, empirically speaking: we don't need more saving &amp; tax cut doesn't cause it

Econ_Marshall	719939859700412416	2016-04-12T17:26:53	ModeledBehavior I think that's squarely within the economics mainstream!
Econ_Marshall	719939800501981184	2016-04-12T17:26:38	ModeledBehavior What are you talking about? I favor a public option for transport consistent with sound urban planning, ie, few cars.
Econ_Marshall	719939331339788289	2016-04-12T17:24:47	ModeledBehavior ie, the rich can hire people to drive them around if they want, but for everyone else, there's cheap and reliable transport
Econ_Marshall	719939230907150336	2016-04-12T17:24:23	ModeledBehavior I don't think taxis are a public good. I'm a raging anti-car bicyclist. We should have bikeshare + public transport + limos
Econ_Marshall	719938569402499072	2016-04-12T17:21:45	ModeledBehavior Still, it's a policy choice in that case. "Because they want to" is generally not a good reason for permitting price-fixing
Econ_Marshall	719938367052382208	2016-04-12T17:20:57	ModeledBehavior Well guaranteed monopoly is longstanding (but generally bad) way of financing public goods, e.g. Thurn und Taxis.
Econ_Marshall	719937881339490305	2016-04-12T17:19:01	Reference is to this piece:  Apparently the reason non-consensual pregnancy is bad is that it harms growth.
Econ_Marshall	719936314846679040	2016-04-12T17:12:47	Note this is a pathology of the Left. Right-wingers don't suffer trauma of being slapped for destroying growth. 
Econ_Marshall	719932661364563968	2016-04-12T16:58:16	ModeledBehavior I don't see why we'd want an illegal price-fixing scheme to exist, in the taxi market or anywhere.

Econ_Marshall	719912882650144770	2016-04-12T15:39:41	ErikLoomis MattBruenig right, but the distinction matters in law here. Either Uber is an employer or it is a trust.
Econ_Marshall	719903250745573377	2016-04-12T15:01:24	MattBruenig ErikLoomis Gotta go
Econ_Marshall	719903226557046784	2016-04-12T15:01:19	MattBruenig ErikLoomis Best case scenario: Sherman Act detonates Uber. Second best: hired as employees.
Econ_Marshall	719903032520097794	2016-04-12T15:00:32	MattBruenig ErikLoomis But my True Belief is that BS tech sector mystification shouldn't undermine employment law &amp; labor bargaining power
Econ_Marshall	719902687765139456	2016-04-12T14:59:10	MattBruenig ErikLoomis I know! That's why I'm strategically adopting the "not employees" position and You Should Too.
Econ_Marshall	719902128634990592	2016-04-12T14:56:57	MattBruenig ErikLoomis Pick a side. But seriously, as both a master troll &amp; a hater of labor, the anti-trust angle is the one for you.
Econ_Marshall	719901451116539904	2016-04-12T14:54:15	I disagree w/ErikLoomis: Uber isn't an employer. It's an illegal horizontal conspiracy to fix prices &amp; skim profit. 
Econ_Marshall	719900256708780032	2016-04-12T14:49:30	goodmanl Moreover, I am curious about the health impact of zero-earning as a phenomenon, but Chetty data cannot help there as you say.
Econ_Marshall	719900057357664256	2016-04-12T14:48:43	goodmanl Yeah, that's the story I prefer. Point is: labor demand explains geographic variation in zero earners.
Econ_Marshall	719899789777891328	2016-04-12T14:47:39	mattyglesias Why didn't the Fed pre-emptively shut off the boom in 1997?
Econ_Marshall	719899296787783680	2016-04-12T14:45:42	goodmanl I thought in standard Rosen-Roback story amenities co-vary negatively with geographic labor demand to produce equilibrium. (??)
Econ_Marshall	719895965273034753	2016-04-12T14:32:27	goodmanl I suppose can't rule out health dist. covaries + w/labor supply, but then (edu-adjusted) wages should be lower in "high-type" CZs.
Econ_Marshall	719894959738982401	2016-04-12T14:28:28	goodmanl Thoughts?
Econ_Marshall	719894652342636544	2016-04-12T14:27:14	goodmanl "If latent health dist. varies geographically and the labor market is irrelevant, corr ~= 0 (generically)"
Econ_Marshall	719894407382765568	2016-04-12T14:26:16	goodmanl "OTOH, if it's b/c labor demand varies, and healthy people are more likely to be employed in a queued, ranked market, corr&lt;0"
Econ_Marshall	719894168835854336	2016-04-12T14:25:19	goodmanl "Why does zero-earning vary geographically? If it's b/c latent health dist. is invariant but labor supply varies,  corr&gt;0"
Econ_Marshall	719893365148545026	2016-04-12T14:22:07	goodmanl Great. Include the point about positive correlation adjudicating theories of zero earning (if you agree with that).
Econ_Marshall	719893106213199872	2016-04-12T14:21:06	mattyglesias See I think that's reductive. It matters who's advocating what. i.e., "it's popular" is facile.
Econ_Marshall	719892835844141057	2016-04-12T14:20:01	goodmanl Right, this is important--but you should still publish your analysis somehow.
Econ_Marshall	719892256489127936	2016-04-12T14:17:43	mattyglesias What's missing is why activists against mass incarceration got no hearing in formal politics then and do now.
Econ_Marshall	719892029573087235	2016-04-12T14:16:49	mattyglesias I think you have the Horton dynamic right, incl. w/urban electorate, but "it's popular" still isn't sufficient.
Econ_Marshall	719891622989807617	2016-04-12T14:15:12	goodmanl Right, and don't they say elsewhere that mortality figures exclude the zero earners because they can't measure mortality for them?
Econ_Marshall	719891196164882433	2016-04-12T14:13:30	goodmanl I would interpret this point as evidence against/in favor of theories of zero earning. ie, not driven by variation in labor supply
Econ_Marshall	719890730077040640	2016-04-12T14:11:39	goodmanl Just trying to get my head around what constitutes zero earning in diff. data sets.
Econ_Marshall	719890626335137792	2016-04-12T14:11:14	goodmanl So the tax data observes "inactive" SSNs? Does filing a tax return matter?
Econ_Marshall	719888910013374464	2016-04-12T14:04:25	Econ_Marshall I was curious so I looked at this. Correlation b/w % with pos income (by CZ in ACS) and life expectancy is &gt; 0.
Econ_Marshall	719889297214685185	2016-04-12T14:05:58	goodmanl Would be curious what Chetty et al's maps look like w/"zero earners" (whoever they are in IRS data) included.
Econ_Marshall	719889158009974784	2016-04-12T14:05:24	goodmanl Right, no kidding. Q. is who is "zero earner" in tax data? But you should post results of that somewhere.

Econ_Marshall	717085994059767808	2016-04-04T20:26:38	JoseTheBae All more education does is raise prices for the poor!
Econ_Marshall	717085823032815616	2016-04-04T20:25:57	JoseTheBae furthermore your conditioning set implies all Human-Capital-approved wage policies are "poorly targeted," eg MOAR EDUCATION

Econ_Marshall	717085284400234499	2016-04-04T20:23:49	JoseTheBae This is a very tortured argument that requires assumptions abt. who benefits from wage increases vs. who pays higher prices...

Econ_Marshall	717084012628557824	2016-04-04T20:18:46	JoseTheBae SeanMcElwee SEIU_California By that argument any wage gain for low-wage workers is poorly-targeted b/c of price effect.

Econ_Marshall	717081631517900801	2016-04-04T20:09:18	JoseTheBae SeanMcElwee SEIU_California since "targeted" programs are far easier to kill--voting public doesn't care abt program evals.
Econ_Marshall	717081346896699393	2016-04-04T20:08:10	JoseTheBae SeanMcElwee SEIU_California Finally, I think "targeting" in general is not a high priority in policy.
Econ_Marshall	717081113278156801	2016-04-04T20:07:14	JoseTheBae SeanMcElwee SEIU_California Notably, that implies EITC is even worse, since in a slack labor market it just lowers wages.
Econ_Marshall	717080984013914112	2016-04-04T20:06:43	JoseTheBae SeanMcElwee SEIU_California &amp; since disemployment effect is nil, only way it's poorly targeted is very poor can't find jobs.

Econ_Marshall	717072367776833536	2016-04-04T19:32:29	JoseTheBae SeanMcElwee SEIU_California No! If you're referring to those in dire poverty, I think a taut labor market would work.

Econ_Marshall	710476073411223552	2016-03-17T14:41:10	Atrios Or, to clarify more, question 1 is "why do the poor move less than the rich in steady state?" Q 2 is "why is everyone moving less?"

Econ_Marshall	709015298234568704	2016-03-13T13:56:34	adamdavidson well I mean on the primary economic issue, not this convo, but sure--happy to.
Econ_Marshall	709015083016462336	2016-03-13T13:55:43	adamdavidson no problem. I might do a long blog post on this, in which case I'll let you know
Econ_Marshall	709014910362120196	2016-03-13T13:55:02	adamdavidson the problem is the govt conspired with corporations to enable middle class destruction, based on faulty Econ theory.
Econ_Marshall	709014568077549568	2016-03-13T13:53:40	adamdavidson so saying the problem with our trade policy is that we didn't raise EITC enough is tone-deaf.
Econ_Marshall	709014342327537664	2016-03-13T13:52:46	adamdavidson furthermore, people don't like redistribution as a policy option, especially if it doesn't actually happen!
Econ_Marshall	709014115235336192	2016-03-13T13:51:52	adamdavidson is alienating, because there really is another way. We could have full employment, we could have worker bargaining power.
Econ_Marshall	709013959580450816	2016-03-13T13:51:15	adamdavidson &amp; I'd be pissed if you told me how to do my job, but telling people to suck it up, which is how that sounds....
Econ_Marshall	709013626154254338	2016-03-13T13:49:55	adamdavidson they think economy is rigged against them--difference between sides is which group gets blamed. It's scarily like Weimar.
Econ_Marshall	709013370926723072	2016-03-13T13:48:55	adamdavidson I'll take off my professional economist's hat &amp; put on my amateur historian's: people in Chicago literally brawling over this.
Econ_Marshall	709011391462699009	2016-03-13T13:41:03	adamdavidson I've made my substantive points. My meta point is that it's time for elite humility on economic effect of globalization.
Econ_Marshall	709011091267964928	2016-03-13T13:39:51	adamdavidson but that's exactly why our trade policy is bad, so "more trade is inevitable" is a weak argument, as paulkrugman said.
Econ_Marshall	709010893577842688	2016-03-13T13:39:04	adamdavidson since modeling dynamics of worker bargaining power is much much less understood, possible further erosion could happen
Econ_Marshall	709010523141099520	2016-03-13T13:37:36	adamdavidson US is basically as open to trade now as it's ever been and has been for 15 yrs. little reason to expect further adjustment.
Econ_Marshall	709010120735383552	2016-03-13T13:36:00	adamdavidson as a % of total GDP? Ambiguous at best.
Econ_Marshall	709009900228235265	2016-03-13T13:35:07	adamdavidson I can only speak for myself and my reading of economic research &amp; other econ's writing, not public opinion.
Econ_Marshall	709009653347258369	2016-03-13T13:34:08	adamdavidson this is a strange statement: economists mostly agree that at this point gains from trade are probably exhausted.
Econ_Marshall	709009472014958594	2016-03-13T13:33:25	adamdavidson you are the one attacking that straw man, not progressive economists.
Econ_Marshall	709009336891273216	2016-03-13T13:32:53	adamdavidson in other words, rejecting US trade policy, not rejecting trade, would be beneficial to US workers.
Econ_Marshall	709008976625733633	2016-03-13T13:31:27	adamdavidson repealing ISDS and IP protections in trade agreements definitely would.
Econ_Marshall	709008818848530432	2016-03-13T13:30:49	adamdavidson ... Our trade policy actively encourages offshoring &amp; threat of offshoring, diminishing worker bargaining power.
Econ_Marshall	709008415511724033	2016-03-13T13:29:13	adamdavidson I'm playing a slick game? I'm the one insisting that policy conclusions not be drawn from discredited mathematical models.
Econ_Marshall	709008160158306304	2016-03-13T13:28:12	adamdavidson I can only name Trump. Who else?
Econ_Marshall	709007943723782145	2016-03-13T13:27:21	adamdavidson that is a straw man.
Econ_Marshall	709007738060328960	2016-03-13T13:26:32	adamdavidson the core issue is that we've decided full employment isn't a policy interest, and not only that, should be actively opposed...
Econ_Marshall	709007561706610688	2016-03-13T13:25:50	adamdavidson you should listen to the interview again: declares total consensus that trade is a net benefit overall...
Econ_Marshall	709007392181190656	2016-03-13T13:25:09	adamdavidson if offshoring threat harms workers, you don't *actually have to be a displaced manufacturing worker* to be harmed by trade
Econ_Marshall	709007165558824960	2016-03-13T13:24:15	adamdavidson 4. Saying "experts say benefits of trade outweigh costs" implies people who think otherwise are stupid.
Econ_Marshall	709006857642319872	2016-03-13T13:23:02	adamdavidson The exact issue with our trade policy is that tariff reductions are mostly absent
Econ_Marshall	709006597775867905	2016-03-13T13:22:00	adamdavidson 3. You said effect on prices outweighs labor impact overall, but no study with realistic assumptions shows this.
Econ_Marshall	709006299640569856	2016-03-13T13:20:49	adamdavidson whereas direct studies of effect of NAFTA and PNTR on US labor market show permanent displacement.
Econ_Marshall	709006118639505408	2016-03-13T13:20:06	adamdavidson 2. Best empirical estimates of effect of NAFTA find small gains for US &amp; ASSUME FULL EMPLOYMENT.
Econ_Marshall	709005911109591040	2016-03-13T13:19:16	adamdavidson with ISDS and IP protections. Those provisions maximize trade deficit at expense of American workers, by making threat potent.
Econ_Marshall	709005675653898240	2016-03-13T13:18:20	adamdavidson so, 1. The most impt problem is that trade deals != trade/tariffs. Trade deals have been designed to max threat of offshoring.
Econ_Marshall	708994181859946496	2016-03-13T12:32:40	In this case, adamdavidson and planetmoney, NPRWeekend are at fault.
Econ_Marshall	708993164321771520	2016-03-13T12:28:37	Mainstream journalistic coverage of trade agreements &amp; political controversy thereover is thoroughly terrible. No wonder people hate econs.

Econ_Marshall	701842312050118657	2016-02-22T18:53:41	mattyglesias The ideology of individuals is, as a matter of interpretative power, inadequate to the task of explaining policy outcomes.

Econ_Marshall	691639128933408768	2016-01-25T15:09:53	ryanlcooper TNC isn't crazy to be arguing these points forcefully. Actual anti-racist policy requires activism and inconvenient pressure.
Econ_Marshall	691638890059403264	2016-01-25T15:08:56	ryanlcooper Those carveouts are what happens when even anti-racist white policy-makers not attuned to white supremacy have power.
Econ_Marshall	691637791902539776	2016-01-25T15:04:34	ryanlcooper *towards blacks,* yes, but it has to get there, and TNC's point could be read as "white supremacy is skilled at thwarting it."
Econ_Marshall	691635758072008705	2016-01-25T14:56:29	ryanlcooper Specifically, HC without requiring subservience to racial hierarchy through supplying labor in discriminatory market.
Econ_Marshall	691635250099806208	2016-01-25T14:54:28	ryanlcooper It also reduces value of HC and pharma company stocks. But anti-hierarchy effect is most relevant.
Econ_Marshall	691633660504739841	2016-01-25T14:48:09	MattBruenig Like libertarianism, that hasn't aged well.
Econ_Marshall	691633238830354432	2016-01-25T14:46:28	ryanlcooper Whereas I say it is anti-white-supremacy b/c it minimizes the power of employers in traditional racial hierarchy.
Econ_Marshall	691633043405148160	2016-01-25T14:45:42	ryanlcooper You previously said single-payer is good for black people b/c they happen to be poor, more or less. That is what TNC criticizes
Econ_Marshall	691632764593008640	2016-01-25T14:44:35	ryanlcooper Complicated. Insofar as it makes HC a right ex-employment, it is not. But what if, eg, unavailable to illegal immigrants?
Econ_Marshall	691632468651282432	2016-01-25T14:43:25	ryanlcooper Well if yours is embodied in that cartoon, you're wrong too. I think your prior column was better statement of (wrong) position
Econ_Marshall	691632233090846720	2016-01-25T14:42:28	ryanlcooper Because white supremacy ensured it wouldn't otherwise.
Econ_Marshall	691632119056064512	2016-01-25T14:42:01	ryanlcooper He's correct b/c economy is always racialized. FDR had to de-segregate military industrial complex for New Deal to reach blacks
Econ_Marshall	691631862138171393	2016-01-25T14:41:00	ryanlcooper You've mischaracterized "rising tide thinking" though. TNC is saying prosperity for all doesn't help black people, empirically.
Econ_Marshall	691631418305310720	2016-01-25T14:39:14	ryanlcooper It's saying the rich guy is better off with a smaller share! Trickle down says if the rich benefit, then the poor will too.
Econ_Marshall	691631236532584448	2016-01-25T14:38:31	squarelyrooted It shows that the fallaciousness is empirically contingent, which is the opposite of Bastiat's point.

Econ_Marshall	691630568841289728	2016-01-25T14:35:52	ryanlcooper Based on that cartoon, you're conflating trickle down with rising tide. It says the rich should be fine from redistribution.
