bendreyfuss	725533164056264705	2016-04-28T03:52:40	brandonwenerd socarolinesays but my real theory is that they have a secret relationship with some larger pages that are helping juice this

bendreyfuss	724385204710838273	2016-04-24T23:51:05	Like these geniuses thought this was such a good point that they made it into a flow chart.  
bendreyfuss	724384920311873536	2016-04-24T23:49:58	“My readers are idiots” “Do you read your own work” “Uh…yes?” “CASE CLOSED” “Wait.” “THE WITNESS IS DISMISSED"
bendreyfuss	724384611573202944	2016-04-24T23:48:44	This is such a straw man. Literally no one thinks “every single 1 of my readers is an idiot”  
bendreyfuss	724363192474972160	2016-04-24T22:23:37	I think if the zombie apocalypse really did come it might make sense just to embrace it and become a zombie
bendreyfuss	724360120231190528	2016-04-24T22:11:25	SBarlow_ROB already watched it all
bendreyfuss	724359292850200576	2016-04-24T22:08:08	People really like the Walking Dead but one thing I think they don’t mention enough is that zombies aren’t real.
bendreyfuss	724347407950065664	2016-04-24T21:20:54	I am out of TV shows and movies to watch so I will rewatch UnReal for the 3rd or 4th time.
bendreyfuss	724338402569662464	2016-04-24T20:45:07	bacrook24 yeah I guess that’s true. It would have been in 2010 wouldn’t it?
bendreyfuss	724337895176310784	2016-04-24T20:43:06	kylegriffin1 Don’t they have to do an election in Massachusetts? Isn’t that what led to Scott Brown?
bendreyfuss	724337469769048065	2016-04-24T20:41:24	Remember when Obama nominated Kathleen Sebelius and then she couldn’t run for Senate? That was dumb.
bendreyfuss	724336946416365569	2016-04-24T20:39:20	She can’t choose Sherrod Brown because then he'd be replaced with a Republican in a year when the Dems are trying to take back the Senate
bendreyfuss	724335926541950976	2016-04-24T20:35:17	I think Hillary’s VP will be Julian Castro or, less likely, Corey Booker.
bendreyfuss	724335184523460608	2016-04-24T20:32:20	As dumb as it is, I think that a lot of people will tell Hillary that she needs to nominate a man to the ticket &amp; that’s what she’ll do
bendreyfuss	724334706624462848	2016-04-24T20:30:26	I don’t know if I buy that Liz Warren would want to be Hillary’s VP but everyone would obviously love that ticket. 
bendreyfuss	724333055733837826	2016-04-24T20:23:52	“You know would make a great VP,” Hillary began. “Larry Summers."
bendreyfuss	724332639411404800	2016-04-24T20:22:13	It would be funny if Hillary chose Tim Geithner as her VP.

bendreyfuss	724142682331832320	2016-04-24T07:47:24	I think James Bond doesn’t use condoms. I think James Bond will eventually die of AIDS.
bendreyfuss	724135930827825152	2016-04-24T07:20:34	Do you think that James Bond carries around a bunch of condoms or is he having unprotected sex all the time?
bendreyfuss	724134138492674048	2016-04-24T07:13:27	Lee Evans is a really nice person.

bendreyfuss	724132792913813504	2016-04-24T07:08:06	Chris_Coffel I mean that is literally the truth. I was so embarrassed and he was like “don’t worry.” Really lovely person.
bendreyfuss	724131366028201984	2016-04-24T07:02:26	bendreyfuss this is amazing. Also what a humble brag. "I was in LONDON seeing a PLAY without my WALLET and LEE EVANS got my TICKET."
bendreyfuss	724131504394252288	2016-04-24T07:02:59	Chris_Coffel hahaha. the play was really great, too.
bendreyfuss	724131005850857472	2016-04-24T07:01:00	Chris_Coffel haha yeah it’s true. it was the play “Democracy” by Michael Frayn
bendreyfuss	724130691689156609	2016-04-24T06:59:45	Chris_Coffel I was going to a play in London once and forgot my wallet and Lee Evans paid for my ticket.
bendreyfuss	724126121491607552	2016-04-24T06:41:35	I have been making jokes about the movie “Mouse Hunt” for years but it turns out it actually made a bunch of money!

bendreyfuss	724097252558548992	2016-04-24T04:46:52	I hated A Most Violent Year so much that I tweeted about it and then the producer responded and explained it to me 
bendreyfuss	724096333636886529	2016-04-24T04:43:13	This is how bad “Joy” was.  
bendreyfuss	724091928795578368	2016-04-24T04:25:43	I guess bustle's one Black writer must have taken the night off to watch LEMONADE, because SHE knows who Becky is. 
bendreyfuss	724095662636339200	2016-04-24T04:40:33	The only movie I’ve ever hated more than “A Most Violent Year” is “Joy."

bendreyfuss	724047743564582912	2016-04-24T01:30:08	I feel like the experience of watching LEMONADE through your tweets is maybe more surreal and amazing than watching it on HBO

bendreyfuss	724045894237208576	2016-04-24T01:22:47	Twitter is making it sound to me like Beyoncé just served Jay-Z divorce papers on live TV possibly in song format

bendreyfuss	723990234380292096	2016-04-23T21:41:37	KendraWrites haha same. I don't even drink diet soda. Seltzer all the way.
bendreyfuss	723989775166914560	2016-04-23T21:39:48	KendraWrites ok that's a fair point. I was too quick and blythe by saying "just drink diet soda"
bendreyfuss	723989530378964995	2016-04-23T21:38:49	"Diet soda made me hungry" isn't the same as "diet soda made me fat." You should always be a little hungry. If you aren't, you overate.
bendreyfuss	723988844773806080	2016-04-23T21:36:06	A lot of people gain weight bc they're like "I did a spin class. I've earned this jelly doughnut." That does mean cycling makes you fat.
bendreyfuss	723988426542993412	2016-04-23T21:34:26	KendraWrites YES it will! If they don't suddenly start eating a bunch of fucking cakes!
bendreyfuss	723988322528444417	2016-04-23T21:34:01	I get studies show people who drink diet soda overindulge on cake &amp; gain weight. That doesn't mean the diet soda makes people fat. Cake does
bendreyfuss	723987974233423872	2016-04-23T21:32:38	KendraWrites except no because people need to just not give into their cravings for cakes. That's what health is about.
bendreyfuss	723987787406557185	2016-04-23T21:31:54	KendraWrites none of these studies say that artificial sweeteners are actually making you fatter. It's the other shit people eat after them
bendreyfuss	723987492400168961	2016-04-23T21:30:43	KendraWrites but that still doesn't mean the soda is making you fatter! It's the fucking cakes people are eating after
bendreyfuss	723987279677665280	2016-04-23T21:29:53	Artificial sweeteners are not worse than sugar. A million studies have demonstrated this. You are all lunatics. 
bendreyfuss	723986989809324032	2016-04-23T21:28:44	KendraWrites that study is so stupid. It's not the diet soda making people fatter. It's that the food they indulge in after.

bendreyfuss	723398782243631105	2016-04-22T06:31:24	nSquib i don’t know how to respond to this. I would call you a prick no mater your gender.
bendreyfuss	723398451996688384	2016-04-22T06:30:05	nSquib Less guilty. More annoyed. I want you to take a razor &amp; cut yourself. Not on the back of your thighs like normal Do it so we can see
bendreyfuss	723398006872002560	2016-04-22T06:28:19	nSquib except not at all you daft ignorant prick because i have literally given interview about this and did so years ago
bendreyfuss	723397586346864640	2016-04-22T06:26:39	NYMag i think that photo is fake
bendreyfuss	723396691265638401	2016-04-22T06:23:05	nSquib but the entire point of acknowledging that is so intellectually i can defend the rest of my dumbass thoughts.
bendreyfuss	723396304022294528	2016-04-22T06:21:33	nSquib but detective you have closed your case. you have proved that my life has been easier than yours. congratulations.
bendreyfuss	723395988178657280	2016-04-22T06:20:18	nSquib I was literally trying to own the fact that my life has been easier than most. That was the whole point of those tweets
bendreyfuss	723395737124368385	2016-04-22T06:19:18	nSquib Are you laboring under the misapprehension that I am billing myself as a fucking coal miner or a soldier in Stalingrad?
bendreyfuss	723395465539022848	2016-04-22T06:18:13	nSquib Of course not everyone does! I’ve been really lucky!
bendreyfuss	723395382768607239	2016-04-22T06:17:53	nSquib I honestly have no idea what the fuck you think you’re proving here.

bendreyfuss	723393929958158336	2016-04-22T06:12:07	MisterMemories right? it would be for something with a higher circulation probably based in LA.
bendreyfuss	723393288930091008	2016-04-22T06:09:34	nSquib If you looked at the actual tweet storm it was about me admitting to my privilege but you were all too dumb to do that so i deleted
bendreyfuss	723392999892258817	2016-04-22T06:08:25	nSquib I think I did delete them in the end but only because stupid people like you were retweeting them out of context
bendreyfuss	723392482222825473	2016-04-22T06:06:22	bendreyfuss Show me that tweet.
bendreyfuss	723391775600046080	2016-04-22T06:03:33	nSquib if i was unwilling to defend my old tweets i would 1) delete them or 2) not defend them

bendreyfuss	723389353351761920	2016-04-22T05:53:56	nSquib exactly my sister got me the job. She worked her ass off for that career. My dad didn’t get her shit.

bendreyfuss	723382565827055616	2016-04-22T05:26:58	PatOConnor_MA I mean that was why Em was able to get CNET to hire me. “His Twitter has been written about in Gawker!” etc
bendreyfuss	723382324868468736	2016-04-22T05:26:00	PatOConnor_MA no, I of course not. I was hired to run the cnet twitter bc of a gawker story about me getting in a fight with joe scarborou

bendreyfuss	720799415666085889	2016-04-15T02:22:27	MikeAndrick but you’re already cut. coal is the cut. it’s too late to worry about not getting cut. you need to treat the wound.
bendreyfuss	720798520995880960	2016-04-15T02:18:53	I have learned two things at Mother Jones: 1) That "Mother Jones" was a real person. 2) A lot of shit about climate change.
bendreyfuss	720798225532391425	2016-04-15T02:17:43	Ianscotthowland it’s not good in a vacuum—bc of local problems with drilling etc—but as an alternative to coal it is good.
bendreyfuss	720797853388554241	2016-04-15T02:16:14	Ianscotthowland but again the most important thing is reducing coal emissions as fast as possible.

bendreyfuss	720797208837283842	2016-04-15T02:13:41	Ianscotthowland the quantum leap you need in renewable investment to eat up coal is not a realistic thing in the immediate term.
bendreyfuss	720796537887027200	2016-04-15T02:11:01	Ianscotthowland no, it doesn’t. This is a fantasy that is not real.
bendreyfuss	720795921139765248	2016-04-15T02:08:33	I’m sorry you don’t like fracking but reducing coal emissions as fast as possible is the most important thing and fracking helps that
bendreyfuss	720795622723477505	2016-04-15T02:07:22	Ianscotthowland but it’s pretty important! Reducing coal emissions asap is the single most important way to address global warming
bendreyfuss	720795115606917120	2016-04-15T02:05:21	If you doubt fracking is better than coal you should go breathe China’s putrid air

bendreyfuss	720770383637561344	2016-04-15T00:27:05	I'm going to go ahead and question this social media strategy. 
bendreyfuss	720767753787994112	2016-04-15T00:16:38	This example is actually real. For like 7 years I told people that EmilyDreyfuss and her husband loved the first "Saw."
bendreyfuss	720766898061881344	2016-04-15T00:13:14	The key to this is to never admit even privately to the person that you've made it up. Eventually they will wonder "did I love 'Saw'?"
bendreyfuss	720766644625227777	2016-04-15T00:12:13	"Why does everyone think I loved Saw?" "Jim, stop. You did love it" "NO I DIDN'T" "This is pathetic, Jim. Just own it" "PLEASE BELIEVE ME"
bendreyfuss	720766003932753920	2016-04-15T00:09:41	"Jim loved the movie 'Saw.' I don't know how he felt about the sequels but he literally called the first one 'better than it should be'"
bendreyfuss	720765609483628545	2016-04-15T00:08:07	Another funny thing to do is make up a really banal story about someone so uninteresting no one would think you made it up and tell everyone

bendreyfuss	720764507920953349	2016-04-15T00:03:44	A funny thing to do to someone you secretly hate is get them to tell you a really emotional thing &amp; then accuse them of lying for no reason

bendreyfuss	717405310533640192	2016-04-05T17:35:29	chelseaadelaine hash_said Slate MatthewKeysLive Like most MJ social policies, it’s basically whatever I’m feeling at any given moment

bendreyfuss	717403653146034176	2016-04-05T17:28:54	hash_said chelseaadelaine MatthewKeysLive Well presumably in this case in lieu of a correction there'd be an editorial note explaining it
bendreyfuss	717403488184041473	2016-04-05T17:28:14	chelseaadelaine hash_said MatthewKeysLive I’m not one of those people but like it isn’t so open and shut.
bendreyfuss	717403365764907009	2016-04-05T17:27:45	chelseaadelaine hash_said MatthewKeysLive yeah some media people believe that you never delete them and just correct them.
bendreyfuss	717402678612082688	2016-04-05T17:25:01	Today 
bendreyfuss	717402958783201280	2016-04-05T17:26:08	hash_said MatthewKeysLive and like I get why answering that question took a few minutes.
bendreyfuss	717402847596396544	2016-04-05T17:25:42	hash_said MatthewKeysLive the screenshots are out there so it becomes a question of which will do more harm: leaving it up or deleting it
bendreyfuss	717402643828776960	2016-04-05T17:24:53	MatthewKeysLive hash_said OK, that’s true
bendreyfuss	717402393164517377	2016-04-05T17:23:53	hash_said MatthewKeysLive I think they probably weren’t sure about how to handle it.
bendreyfuss	717402113693888517	2016-04-05T17:22:47	MatthewKeysLive hash_said oh well I would just defend the TNR social person bc I imagine they are having a bad day that isn’t their fault
bendreyfuss	717401820704989184	2016-04-05T17:21:37	MatthewKeysLive hash_said It was a joke because of this thread that had just gone on 
bendreyfuss	717401704304615424	2016-04-05T17:21:09	MatthewKeysLive hash_said and if you’re talking about the Mother Jones tweet it was a direct reply so it wasn’t about getting attention
bendreyfuss	717401609576259586	2016-04-05T17:20:47	MatthewKeysLive hash_said that tweet wasn’t sent by a social media manager. They gave their account to a writer.

bendreyfuss	717396208839430144	2016-04-05T16:59:19	theodoreross jakebeckman Aside from the inconsistency, the tweets are just hard to follow so the storms are a high barrier to entry
bendreyfuss	717395077816049664	2016-04-05T16:54:49	NewRepublic jakebeckman It’s ok! It’s nothing personal! It just drives me crazy from a social media strategy point of view.
bendreyfuss	717394940859387909	2016-04-05T16:54:17	At least when brand’s gave their twitter accounts to celebrities in like 2013 it was a stunt designed to gain followers.
bendreyfuss	717394743852941313	2016-04-05T16:53:30	If you want one person to say a bunch of stuff on Twitter and you want your followers to see it, just retweet them. The end.

bendreyfuss	715718309682024448	2016-04-01T01:51:57	@BraceBelden Yeah, I think you’re right. If it results in objective long terms negative effects than other states can do something else
bendreyfuss	715717975614029824	2016-04-01T01:50:37	ViralDonutz Yeah but that’s what I’m saying I instinctively say raise it but if the economists say too high or wtv then maybe they’re right
bendreyfuss	715717255770804224	2016-04-01T01:47:45	@BraceBelden I totally agree with you. I m just saying that I’m not an expert on how it will affect businesses hiring practices
bendreyfuss	715717007052824576	2016-04-01T01:46:46	HayesBrown “blackcock” is probably a very sane place where very sane people talk about very sane ethics in gaming journalism
bendreyfuss	715716305257697282	2016-04-01T01:43:59	ViralDonutz but wages aren’t set bc philosophically people think they deserve more. They’re set based on demand once they’re above minimum
bendreyfuss	715714255664840707	2016-04-01T01:35:50	ViralDonutz probably not bc it requires training etc but I don’t know enough about this. But yeah pay them more than $15 is my feeling
bendreyfuss	715713399619977217	2016-04-01T01:32:26	Anyway society dictates that we're not allowed to say we aren’t sure abut something so I look forward to all of you repeating talking points
bendreyfuss	715712979879260161	2016-04-01T01:30:46	ViralDonutz i don’t know. they’re not being paid the minimum wage so they’re already negotiating a wage above regulation.
bendreyfuss	715712456107114496	2016-04-01T01:28:41	Like if you just pass a raise in LA only I sort of could see a business relocating to Long Beach. But I can’t see them going to Nevada
bendreyfuss	715712236904390656	2016-04-01T01:27:49	ViralDonutz I mean I personally think it should be as high as possible before not crazy economists say it would be bad for the economy
bendreyfuss	715711924961456128	2016-04-01T01:26:34	KFoleyFL but i mean you’re not an economist either so you are just as unqualified to talk about this as I am.
bendreyfuss	715711822079328256	2016-04-01T01:26:10	I sort of think that a state-wide minimum wage increase would have less averse effects than a city-alone raise…but again i aint no expert
bendreyfuss	715711328573341697	2016-04-01T01:24:12	Of course the minimum wage should be $15 but I’m not an economist &amp; I don’t know if it needs to be phased in more

bendreyfuss	715393723123695616	2016-03-31T04:22:09	edzitron Gchat is a good way. I learned this after trial and error with a number of them.
bendreyfuss	715393286412705793	2016-03-31T04:20:25	edzitron yeah! Let’s start big!

bendreyfuss	715392751194345472	2016-03-31T04:18:17	edzitron You pick. But it should probably be as famous a one as possible that still works.
bendreyfuss	715392484788928515	2016-03-31T04:17:14	Johngcole I wish I had never seen Crimson Tide so that I could watch it right now.

bendreyfuss	715389224019562496	2016-03-31T04:04:16	Johngcole yeah I was a big fan when it was on. The last few seasons got dumb in retrospect.

bendreyfuss	715271179926245376	2016-03-30T20:15:13	MicahLance I mean I don’t think you should outlaw abortion but if you did and really wanted to stop back ally abortions you’d punish both?
bendreyfuss	715270102426329088	2016-03-30T20:10:56	jakebeckman lol that account randomly faves my tweets sometimes and i still don’t even get what it is
bendreyfuss	715269743175868416	2016-03-30T20:09:30	If you think that abortion is murder, then I don’t see why you wouldn’t want to punish murderers.  It’s nice being pro-choice.
bendreyfuss	715269277314461696	2016-03-30T20:07:39	Sure am glad I’m not pro-Life.
bendreyfuss	715268982169731072	2016-03-30T20:06:29	Legit question 
bendreyfuss	715260502360723456	2016-03-30T19:32:47	andylancaster right but if you believe abortion is murder than I don’t see why punishment for the people who commit it is so bad?
bendreyfuss	715255944104423424	2016-03-30T19:14:40	andylancaster but I’m also out of my range
bendreyfuss	715255881739345920	2016-03-30T19:14:25	andylancaster Yeah I mean the liberals are pro-choice. I just don’t understand why pro-lifers have a problem with what Trump said.
bendreyfuss	715254826687270912	2016-03-30T19:10:14	andylancaster right, if you accept the pro-life belief that fetuses are babies which liberals do not.
bendreyfuss	715254196010790912	2016-03-30T19:07:43	To go a bit further, if you think that fetuses are babies—which I do not—then it follows that you’d want to punish people who have abortions
bendreyfuss	715253714202656768	2016-03-30T19:05:48	andylancaster I just don’t really understand it/it seems like a semantic distinction Punishment=bad Statistical assurance of dying moms=ok
bendreyfuss	715252927112216576	2016-03-30T19:02:41	Pro-Lifer outrage over Trump’s comment is hard to swallow since their position would inevitably cause women to die from back alley abortions
bendreyfuss	715249314419703808	2016-03-30T18:48:19	I know all you conservatives are like “we’d never punish women for having abortions” but

bendreyfuss	713462611011117056	2016-03-25T20:28:36	I should write about comic books more often. People feel way too strongly about them.
bendreyfuss	713462494703042560	2016-03-25T20:28:08	This dude wrote a 22 point response to my review of Batman v Superman  
bendreyfuss	713459772545179650	2016-03-25T20:17:19	The old “I didn’t blow him up, I blew his car up” defense

bendreyfuss	713448335617736704	2016-03-25T19:31:53	This is like that Seinfeld episode where the guy is obsessed about the race only real life and about Merrick Garland

bendreyfuss	713445008041443328	2016-03-25T19:18:39	Tweet was sent from an iPhone by DanScavino. This opens the door to the possibility Trump sends none of his tweets 
bendreyfuss	713444490971848705	2016-03-25T19:16:36	We have new evidence in the investigation of whether Donald Trump sends his own tweets

bendreyfuss	713424658830262274	2016-03-25T17:57:48	This Batman v. Superman review by bendreyfuss is amazing, but the URL is the Batman v. Superman of URLs 
bendreyfuss	713424716715991040	2016-03-25T17:58:01	I got “Inception” I get “Batman v Superman” These blockbusters aren’t difficult to get.
bendreyfuss	713424420963004417	2016-03-25T17:56:51	This response is funny. “You didn’t like Batman v Superman because you didn’t get it.”  
bendreyfuss	713422361614221313	2016-03-25T17:48:40	One-fourth of the Mother Jones NY bureau just won a Fulbright Scholarship. Congratulations, timmcdonnell! 
bendreyfuss	713420198670249985	2016-03-25T17:40:04	.bendreyfuss has a very funny, very mean, spoiler laden review of Batman vs Superman:  
bendreyfuss	713414440876642304	2016-03-25T17:17:11	Actually I wrote that but the guy from Wavves did screenshot it. 
bendreyfuss	713401840197570560	2016-03-25T16:27:07	moelane haha very true
bendreyfuss	713401526216179713	2016-03-25T16:25:52	gayannsmith MotherJones He personally is never bad but he’s been in tons of bad movies.
bendreyfuss	713401317335699458	2016-03-25T16:25:03	Batman v Superman makes no sense at all  
bendreyfuss	713400593583378432	2016-03-25T16:22:10	I wrote a very mean review about the very bad film Batman v Superman 
bendreyfuss	713352186600824832	2016-03-25T13:09:49	People cheat. Sorry to shatter your romcom fantasy world.
bendreyfuss	713351893246980096	2016-03-25T13:08:39	Another thing about affairs is that like shut up.
bendreyfuss	713351587045974017	2016-03-25T13:07:26	I don’t care. I don’t believe it. Not buying it.  
bendreyfuss	713349969521061888	2016-03-25T13:01:00	“Hi my name’s Ted” “Hi I am the press secretary for your opponent Donald Trump” “You have pretty eyes” “Let us make sex backstage at debate"
bendreyfuss	713349493429837824	2016-03-25T12:59:07	So the theory that Ted Cruz is having affairs with the campaign staff go his opponents seems not totally realistic 
bendreyfuss	713341472934924288	2016-03-25T12:27:15	The unbelievable part of this Cruz sex scandal is the idea that anyone would willingly have sex with Ted Cruz.
bendreyfuss	713215237474934784	2016-03-25T04:05:38	I’m watching a documentary about the period between WWI and WWII. This was my main takeaway. 
bendreyfuss	713214982645813248	2016-03-25T04:04:37	Hitler was a big fat uggo jerk
bendreyfuss	713212242276196352	2016-03-25T03:53:44	AlexParkerDC although one of my favorite bits in any batman movie is “it’s a painting of a cow eating grass"
bendreyfuss	713211989661769728	2016-03-25T03:52:43	AlexParkerDC and like there are other scenes like that scene that annoy me.
bendreyfuss	713211843402186756	2016-03-25T03:52:08	AlexParkerDC I think it’s the next best but there are bits of that film that have always annoyed me. The museum scene is so dumb
bendreyfuss	713211095658455040	2016-03-25T03:49:10	AlexParkerDC *think
bendreyfuss	713211003819917312	2016-03-25T03:48:48	AlexParkerDC i thin it and batman returns are the best batman movies.
bendreyfuss	713210772726358016	2016-03-25T03:47:53	id_gordon i read this and was like “wait i bought Perry Ellis suites when he was like 2 then oh wait maybe it’s a different perry ellis"

bendreyfuss	713192983856877569	2016-03-25T02:37:12	KFoleyFL GPollowitz jpodhoretz Man of Steel was SOOOOOOOOO much better than Batman v Superman. It isn’t even close.
bendreyfuss	713181554688835584	2016-03-25T01:51:47	3 types of people I will not associate with: 1. International terrorists 2. Domestic terrorists 3. People who don't like Newman's Own
bendreyfuss	713174248689414144	2016-03-25T01:22:45	trumwill a really different sort of failure but almost on par in terms of general unejoyable experience watching
bendreyfuss	713172880708775936	2016-03-25T01:17:19	"Batman v Superman" is a failure on every single level.
bendreyfuss	713163349635244032	2016-03-25T00:39:27	Omg the "why did you say her name" scene was the worst.
bendreyfuss	713159311673933824	2016-03-25T00:23:24	Metropolis and Gotham are literally as close to each other as Brooklyn and Manhattan

bendreyfuss	713151956278198273	2016-03-24T23:54:10	This movie is exhaustingly bad. It is making me very tired.
bendreyfuss	713151788698976256	2016-03-24T23:53:30	I'm not sure how they made this batman movie worse than the dark knight rises but they appear to have done it.
