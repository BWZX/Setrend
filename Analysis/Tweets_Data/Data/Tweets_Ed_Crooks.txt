Ed_Crooks	691301880157323264	2016-01-24T16:49:46	andrew_leach That was my point. More responsive supply should mean less volatile prices, surely?
Ed_Crooks	691301300005371904	2016-01-24T16:47:28	stephoilpricing Good point. But availability of capital = capex = production higher if price higher, surely?

Ed_Crooks	691293585585610754	2016-01-24T16:16:49	Mike_Blakemore Agreed, but to the extent that US shale is the marginal barrel, should at least reduce volatility somewhat, surely?

Ed_Crooks	691292066425495552	2016-01-24T16:10:46	CostaSamaras Evidence is, erm, mixed. Volatility was very low, and falling, up until the summer of 2014. And then it wasn't

Ed_Crooks	691290932520574978	2016-01-24T16:06:16	So if it takes a smaller move in prices to deliver a given supply response, prices should be less volatile, not more, surely? (7/n)
Ed_Crooks	691290411751587840	2016-01-24T16:04:12	So the price elasticity of US shale supply should be higher. People argue that once we get back to $50-$60, US production will rebound (6/n)
Ed_Crooks	691289514329935873	2016-01-24T16:00:38	But US shale, it is generally assumed, is more flexible than conventional production. The cycle is measured in months, not years (5/n)
Ed_Crooks	691288265048092672	2016-01-24T15:55:40	And price changes also take time to affect demand, through efficiency gains or losses, fuel switching and /or economic growth (4/n)
Ed_Crooks	691287634753273856	2016-01-24T15:53:10	High prices take time to deliver a supply response, eg Alaska and North Sea in the 1970s, US shale in the 2010s (3/n)
Ed_Crooks	691287407283585024	2016-01-24T15:52:16	The traditional explanation for oil price volatility is that the price elasticity of both supply and demand is low in the short term (2/n)

Ed_Crooks	685137368005869568	2016-01-07T16:34:12	cdbrown91 AndOurPosterity Agreed. But Saudi Aramco IPO would be the definitive confirmation of that point
Ed_Crooks	685136866715299841	2016-01-07T16:32:12	.Ed_Crooks I disagree: you can apply a near-50% discount to their reserves and still get there--even at $30. Courageous on reserves maybe
Ed_Crooks	685135868286382080	2016-01-07T16:28:14	Calling Saudi Aramco "the most valuable company in the world" means taking a pretty courageous view on political risk
Ed_Crooks	685135141841272832	2016-01-07T16:25:21	OilSheppard Agreed. Could work either way. Key point is misalignment of interests between KSA and private investors

Ed_Crooks	685116461732462592	2016-01-07T15:11:07	Saudi Aramco is like an entire, separate state unto itself. The due diligence would be amazing...
