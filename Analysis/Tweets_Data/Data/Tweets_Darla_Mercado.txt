Darla_Mercado	710201551978176512	2016-03-16T20:30:19	If you've been in the insurance industry, you've seen policies crash &amp; burn due to poor illustrations, underfunding, failure to monitor.
Darla_Mercado	710201096795504640	2016-03-16T20:28:31	The 6th step via Veralytic: Monitor the policy. Ppl tend to sell insurance and forget it. Perform periodic reports on cost, other factors.
Darla_Mercado	710200736915783680	2016-03-16T20:27:05	Flagg, Veralytic: 5. Implement plan. Define your due diligence for insurance. Financial strength, claims pay ability, cost competitiveness
Darla_Mercado	710200456987992064	2016-03-16T20:25:58	Flagg of Veralytic: 4. Formalize solutions. Solution shouldn't be constrained by compensation model, distrib channel, proprietary prods.
Darla_Mercado	710200174866472961	2016-03-16T20:24:51	3. Strategize: consider risk tolerance, assets and asset class, time horizons, expected outcomes. Ask what is the assumed rate? Actual rate?
Darla_Mercado	710199887015636993	2016-03-16T20:23:42	Six steps per Veralytic 1. Define roles: advisor recommending life insurance must discuss conflicts of interest. 2. Analyze the situation.
Darla_Mercado	710199416704126976	2016-03-16T20:21:50	Hence a 6 step process for sale, care and feeding of life insurance policies, says Flagg of Veralytic.
Darla_Mercado	710199078039195648	2016-03-16T20:20:29	Flagg's 3 key factors in life ins performance: the cost of insurance, policy exp and investment earnings on premiums in excess of COI &amp; exp.

Darla_Mercado	701800386508754944	2016-02-22T16:07:05	So no, it’s not right to equate ppl who collect asset-based, hourly, or subscription-based fees with ppl who are paid with commissions.  😒😒😒
Darla_Mercado	701798819567181825	2016-02-22T16:00:52	But the point is that in your business model, you collect payment from commish and from wrap fees. Hence, you are fee-based, not fee only.
Darla_Mercado	701798681029296128	2016-02-22T16:00:19	Meanwhile, there are diff degrees of fee-based. You can have a combo of advisory and commish biz and sell an annuity w/a wrap fee.
Darla_Mercado	701798420407787521	2016-02-22T15:59:16	To be fee-only: You’ve cut your ties to the commission-based world. You shed your old biz that pays a trail. You revamp your comp practices.
Darla_Mercado	701798192900390913	2016-02-22T15:58:22	If you’re an advisor who had to sell off an old commish biz so that you could become fee only, you probably resent being called "fee-based."

Darla_Mercado	692065092238704641	2016-01-26T19:22:30	It’s gotta be a play for HSA dollars. And they have the footprint in the 401k space to make a go at distribution.

Darla_Mercado	692057895249248257	2016-01-26T18:53:54	jamesacoxiii For sure. If you’re hopping jobs and you’re young, you can consolidate those assets and then convert them at a lower tax rate.

Darla_Mercado	692056674761379840	2016-01-26T18:49:03	I faced that issue with my husband, and we wound up opening a rollover IRA to collect assets from four different 401ks.
Darla_Mercado	692056417822441472	2016-01-26T18:48:02	Another situation where that IRA rollover may make sense: You switch jobs every few years. You have $ in eleventy 401k plans as a result.

Darla_Mercado	692054229163311104	2016-01-26T18:39:20	It’s an interesting shift in messaging: Stay in the 401k instead of taking a rollover. Consider inst’l pricing, protection under ERISA.
