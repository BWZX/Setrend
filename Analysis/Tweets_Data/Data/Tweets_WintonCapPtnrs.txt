WintonCapPtnrs	712680182620893184	2016-03-23T16:39:31	Obama just called Islam one of the world's great religions. Based on what exactly? What has Islam achieved, accomplished to make them so?

WintonCapPtnrs	712362361760264193	2016-03-22T19:36:36	jameskostohryz ISIS is ideological. Others hate us for being there, agree they would likely back off if we were gone.
WintonCapPtnrs	712360730566066176	2016-03-22T19:30:07	jameskostohryz It is prophesied in the Quran &amp; they have convinced others it's coming true so they are getting on the train so to speak.
WintonCapPtnrs	712360255779315712	2016-03-22T19:28:14	jameskostohryz Not totally accurate. ISIS is gaining strength bec they've convinced other Muslims the story of Caliphate is coming true.

WintonCapPtnrs	712357750404046849	2016-03-22T19:18:17	jameskostohryz I agree that's what I said, too. ISIS is about the Caliphate and bringing about the end of days. They r following the Quran
