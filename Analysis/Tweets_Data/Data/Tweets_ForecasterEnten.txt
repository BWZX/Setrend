ForecasterEnten	724418373057175552	2016-04-25T02:02:53	haydenmiller95 The minimal gain Cruz has for playing there is maybe like 3 or 4 delegates. In Indiana, it's like 30.

ForecasterEnten	721018671766880262	2016-04-15T16:53:41	ForecasterEnten I thought Nominate scores measured party loyalty--not ideology. Loyalty not a perfect proxy for ideology.

ForecasterEnten	721016663814967297	2016-04-15T16:45:43	davidshor interested to see southern exits (I know, I know) recalculated with median/mean northern % ideology... If that makes sense...
ForecasterEnten	721016404435054594	2016-04-15T16:44:41	davidshor And Clinton wins among all the ideological groups in the south for the most part. I haven't calculated it yet, but would be...

ForecasterEnten	721015881866678274	2016-04-15T16:42:36	davidshor A few thoughts: 1. Clinton is winning the gerrymandered Democratic districts by more than she is winning outside them.
ForecasterEnten	721011744483618818	2016-04-15T16:26:10	scorpiomurtlock A little, but I'd rather be attacked than no one caring what I think.

ForecasterEnten	721011532390240256	2016-04-15T16:25:19	ahmadsandman I mean there is also gerrymandering in north (PA, MI, etc.), but Clinton's strongest areas were those gerrymandered districts.

ForecasterEnten	720808789176381440	2016-04-15T02:59:41	Again folks, the reason Sanders lost in the south is because Clinton does well among black voters. It's not about conservatism.

ForecasterEnten	718822866054197248	2016-04-09T15:28:21	It's also why a split in the opposition to Trump can actually help him in New York. Less of a shot voters know how to vote strategically.

ForecasterEnten	718818181222174721	2016-04-09T15:09:44	Point is there is demographic evidence (plus some polling) that suggests Trump is under 50% in a # of upstate &amp; non-SI/Queens districts.
ForecasterEnten	718817606644408320	2016-04-09T15:07:27	Wouldn't it make more sense to go where he has less of a shot of getting over 50%? Otherwise, he's leaving delegates on the board...
ForecasterEnten	718817472095379456	2016-04-09T15:06:54	In another sense, it makes no sense. Getting over 50% statewide only gets you 14 additional delegates. And Trump is already crushing LI...
ForecasterEnten	718817282680627200	2016-04-09T15:06:09	In one sense, Trump going to LI makes sense: area friendly and can ensure he gets over 50% statewide. (1/?)

ForecasterEnten	717084877657620480	2016-04-04T20:22:12	balop_skao Yes. Especially 15+, which is what he needs to be on track to overtake Clinton in pledged delegate count.

ForecasterEnten	717084300152336384	2016-04-04T20:19:54	Sanders and Cruz are likely to win in WI. Any other result would be very bad for their campaigns. Question is margins.

ForecasterEnten	715518156261949441	2016-03-31T12:36:36	Q-pac has often overstated Trump margins, but 56% in NY would likely get Trump close to winning all 95 delegates

ForecasterEnten	715257904505483264	2016-03-30T19:22:27	hershy718 There's a media market breakdown. It would seem Cruz is ahead in five districts. 1 for Kasich. 2 too close to call.

ForecasterEnten	715027174324113408	2016-03-30T04:05:37	benspielberg My idea is to give folks my best understanding of what I think will happen. It just so happens Sanders is in a tough position.
ForecasterEnten	715026804600389633	2016-03-30T04:04:09	benspielberg Unfortunately, punditry/analysis doesn't happen in a vacuum. I wish it did. People should vote. My idea isn't to shut it down.
ForecasterEnten	715026513679237121	2016-03-30T04:03:00	benspielberg That usually holds up... Hence, the confidence on that particular call.

ForecasterEnten	715026201543356417	2016-03-30T04:01:45	benspielberg I read the piece. Modesty is always good. Twitter doesn't lend itself to it. Though I think that Michigan was a one off...

ForecasterEnten	715025226489266176	2016-03-30T03:57:53	benspielberg nicholas_warino I just meant generally of how voters vote. Most voters don't read us. (Heck most people don't, haha.)

ForecasterEnten	715022906233921536	2016-03-30T03:48:39	sunnydfan4eva Two easy reasons for this. 1. Clinton has a majority of delegates. Trump doesn't. 2. Dems all proportional. GOP not.

ForecasterEnten	714994499458580482	2016-03-30T01:55:47	mikeerman1 Implicit (or I meant it to be) is that delegates not pledged to him will likely overwhelmingly go against him.

ForecasterEnten	713787410870636547	2016-03-26T17:59:14	yeayourite The reason Reagan trailed early on is Iran Contra. Same reason Kennedy did against Carter. Once it flipped, Carter was done.

ForecasterEnten	710236500571590656	2016-03-16T22:49:11	Could you imagine the press coverage of a GOP prez candidate going for votes in majority-minority districts in NYC? To me, a no brainer.
ForecasterEnten	710236118617354240	2016-03-16T22:47:40	In the 2012 GOP NY primary, 3 districts had under 1,000 voters. One had 285. You could literally meet the voters individually.
ForecasterEnten	710234957394919424	2016-03-16T22:43:04	I still have zero idea why Kasich won't go to NYC and camp out in these very Democratic districts within the city. Better than Utah anyway.

ForecasterEnten	710136733468327937	2016-03-16T16:12:45	.sharpe222 If Trump wins delegates in UT (possible if Cruz doesn't hit 50%), it would be a clear sign that nevertrump will just be never.
ForecasterEnten	710136213374705665	2016-03-16T16:10:41	Some team should consider signing him  I'm actually kinda serious.
ForecasterEnten	710135813498126336	2016-03-16T16:09:06	Next Tuesday: Trump probably wins 58 delegates in Arizona. Cruz probably takes a backdoor WTA in Utah and 40 delegates.
ForecasterEnten	710132461146083328	2016-03-16T15:55:47	If the ceiling or floor or whatever the heck it is now resides in the mid to high 30s instead of low to mid 30s, it's far harder to beat him
ForecasterEnten	710132177057484800	2016-03-16T15:54:39	That would suggest if anything Trump's support is rising, not falling. And it would suggest perhaps the attack ads didn't really work...
ForecasterEnten	710132026830155776	2016-03-16T15:54:03	To contradict myself a little bit, the biggest news on the GOP side was that Trump was at 35.6% or above in all primaries. (1/?)

ForecasterEnten	710119136924463104	2016-03-16T15:02:50	I've said it once and I'll say it again: if you believe Trump does well in Cali the chance for a contested convention drops considerably.
ForecasterEnten	710118499801305089	2016-03-16T15:00:18	sunnydfan4eva Definitely cannot on the first ballot unless a miracle happens for him. Kasich obviously needs math to not exist.
ForecasterEnten	710116609826934784	2016-03-16T14:52:47	sunnydfan4eva there's a big difference. Dem has been a two-way race all along. It's either Trump or contested. Dem is just Clinton.

ForecasterEnten	709539315286720512	2016-03-15T00:38:50	nealcincinnati scallywagger01 Correct. It's two biggest misses were NH and NV.
ForecasterEnten	709539048021430272	2016-03-15T00:37:46	Our polls-plus is more balanced. It has underestimated Trump's percentage of vote by more than a point 6 of 15, overestimated 6 of 15.
ForecasterEnten	709538452518412288	2016-03-15T00:35:24	So if you took that on its face, it would suggest Trump is more likely to underperform vs. his polls than overperform.
ForecasterEnten	709538293063544833	2016-03-15T00:34:46	On average our polls-only model has overshot Trump's percentage of the vote by 2.05 points.

ForecasterEnten	709528476051775488	2016-03-14T23:55:45	Sure, Kasich being a favorite son boosted Kasich overall, but it's his coalition of how he gets to 40% that is of greater interest to me.

ForecasterEnten	709527933568864256	2016-03-14T23:53:36	scallywagger01 The polling could be dead wrong. If you read my preview, I say as much. These are polling based models.
ForecasterEnten	709527782640984064	2016-03-14T23:53:00	gracieneymar Other states show the same pattern... This isn't rocket science listening to Kasich.
ForecasterEnten	709527478180700160	2016-03-14T23:51:47	But it seems entirely plausible that Cruz can compete where Kasich cannot (the west), while Kasich could do somewhat decently in PA/NY...
ForecasterEnten	709527316473503745	2016-03-14T23:51:09	Kasich dropping out necessarily helps Cruz. Nor am I convinced staying in hurts him. Now, it could be the case that it does... (3/?)
ForecasterEnten	709527161657499649	2016-03-14T23:50:32	Cruz, using Oklahoma as an example, lost the moderate vote to Trump, even though he easily won overall. I'm unconvinced that (2/?)
ForecasterEnten	709526765723586560	2016-03-14T23:48:57	If Kasich wins OH, he did it by breaking Trump's stranglehold among moderates. He beat him from the left. Very different than Cruz (1/?).
