davidfrum	713808812021530626	2016-03-26T19:24:17	Over &amp; out. Besides, the plane’s about to shut off the wifi
davidfrum	713808486828740608	2016-03-26T19:22:59	15) What kind of “conservative” sees arrangements that have worked so well, so long and says: “Let’s blow them up” ?
davidfrum	713808273695182848	2016-03-26T19:22:09	14) Bottom line: by the standards of human frailty, the US + friends have done amazingly positive things together since 1945
davidfrum	713807921889558529	2016-03-26T19:20:45	13) And let’s recall: allies have some grievances against the US too (and some of them quite credible)
davidfrum	713806483033612288	2016-03-26T19:15:02	12) And let’s not denigrate what US allies do in fact do … it’s the EU, not the US, that funds the rebuilding of central Europe
davidfrum	713805876637868032	2016-03-26T19:12:37	11) There were powerfully good reasons why the US and its allies divided the military aspect of security as they have done since 1945
davidfrum	713805615290793985	2016-03-26T19:11:35	10) GK Chesterton has a great line about never pulling down a wall unless you know why it was put up
davidfrum	713805357156577280	2016-03-26T19:10:33	9) Allies who agree to import security from the US rather than try (dangerously) to generate their own are a feature, not a bug
davidfrum	713805083838976002	2016-03-26T19:09:28	8) That geography plus America’s unique productive capacity has enabled the US to generate a “security surplus” it can export to allies
davidfrum	713804819375525888	2016-03-26T19:08:25	7) The US has a uniquely secure geopolitical position: a continent shared only w friendly Canada and weak Mexico
davidfrum	713804450847133697	2016-03-26T19:06:57	6) I met people in Hungary who dislike Romania and Croatia a lot more than they fear Russia.
davidfrum	713804287810338816	2016-03-26T19:06:18	5) Allies and clients who do pay more are at risk of tumbling into conflict with each other.
davidfrum	713804090879451136	2016-03-26T19:05:31	4) Allies who are told to quit “riding for free” are at least as likely to strike their own deals with China/Russia rather than pay more
davidfrum	713803825858134016	2016-03-26T19:04:28	3) Many forms of “free-riding” are highly congenial to the US. Who’s sorry that Japan no longer tries to police the Pacific for itself?
davidfrum	713803433724284928	2016-03-26T19:02:55	2) It’s not realistic to imagine that allies will “contribute more” without also demanding a large say over what they are contributing to.
davidfrum	713803021063495684	2016-03-26T19:01:16	1) A very great many US foreign policy troubles originate precisely with allies &amp; clients riding NOT for free - eg Qatar/Turkey in Syria

davidfrum	710471081098944513	2016-03-17T14:21:20	Powerful 
davidfrum	710468224886898688	2016-03-17T14:09:59	OK, that’s enough for now
davidfrum	710467634626605058	2016-03-17T14:07:38	15) Instead, the "change-nothing" faction has lost control of their own presidential nomination. We’ll see what more there is left to lose.
davidfrum	710466759661363200	2016-03-17T14:04:09	14) The dominant faction on my side of the argument, however, has insisted that it can win all, by changing none.
davidfrum	710466597908041728	2016-03-17T14:03:31	jpodhoretz er, right
davidfrum	710466088509767680	2016-03-17T14:01:29	13) I’ve spent a lot of time being dismissed as a RINO squish, or worse, because I think to save most of conservatism, we must change some.
davidfrum	710465571435978752	2016-03-17T13:59:26	12) Yet even as the R elite sees what’s probably coming, it won’t believe it. What worked in 1980 must work again. It just *must*.
davidfrum	710464981708492800	2016-03-17T13:57:06	11) The big clarifying election Ryan yearns for is much more likely to consolidate D control than R control- as he must see.
davidfrum	710464793707200512	2016-03-17T13:56:21	10) But (as Ryan told Harwood), desperately as GOP elites seek an escape, they cannot see it. They will allow themselves to be dragged
davidfrum	710464344136523777	2016-03-17T13:54:34	9) Trump being a candidate whom most Republicans elite regard as a Goldwater-style disaster who will drag whole party to defeat after him
davidfrum	710464091299717120	2016-03-17T13:53:33	8) So as GOP generals stood at Armageddon to battle for the Lord, i.e. Reagan, their troops were deserting to Donald Trump
davidfrum	710463624171622400	2016-03-17T13:51:42	7) The problem was, that the Republican leadership’s version of a right turn - Paul Ryan’s version - was not what the base had in mind
davidfrum	710463173833433089	2016-03-17T13:49:55	6) Result: while Democrats turned to center after their beatings in 80, 84, 88 - Republicans turned further right after 08 &amp; 12.
davidfrum	710462959873597441	2016-03-17T13:49:04	5) While high turnout elections (2008 and 2012) confirmed my assessment, low turnout elections (2010 and 2014) seemed to confirmed theirs
davidfrum	710462548311728129	2016-03-17T13:47:25	4) To put it mildly, few other conservatives shared this view. They saw the same landscape, and saw a country ripe for Reagan-Kemp 2.0
davidfrum	710462313174855680	2016-03-17T13:46:29	3) EG yield on universal healthcare coverage to avert pressure for more radical income redistribution.
davidfrum	710461857316913153	2016-03-17T13:44:41	2) It seemed to me that this was a moment for conservatives to offer timely concessions to mitigate even worse possibilities.
davidfrum	710461523391619072	2016-03-17T13:43:21	1) A personal statement first. It’s been my perception since 2008 that US politics are shifting left, as they shifted right after 1970

davidfrum	708284486853595136	2016-03-11T13:32:35	- over and out for the time being -
davidfrum	708284008686223360	2016-03-11T13:30:41	14) The wilderness years may fade into wilderness decades - &amp; “true conservatism” into a purely intellectual movement of dissent.
davidfrum	708283455524569089	2016-03-11T13:28:29	13) A “true conservative” exit will empower those Republican politicians who see the future as “Trumpism without Trump.”
davidfrum	708282680270401536	2016-03-11T13:25:24	12) Democrats for Nixon in 1972 became Democrats for Reagan in 1980 … and outright Republicans by 1984.
davidfrum	708282517187473408	2016-03-11T13:24:46	11) Many of the Roosevelt Democrats of 1932- Harold Ickes eg - were people who had bolted the GOP in 1912 and never returned.
davidfrum	708282331103014912	2016-03-11T13:24:01	10) So the “true conservative” independent line it is. The trouble is … that temporary party splits have a way of hardening
davidfrum	708282114593009664	2016-03-11T13:23:10	9) Meaning that the D turnout slide from 08 to 12 can continue into 16 - and still deliver a 1980 style sequence of wins in Senate &amp; states
davidfrum	708281710840942593	2016-03-11T13:21:33	8) And such a turnout collapse will doom Republican down ballot candidates across the country. Goodbye, Senator Portman.
davidfrum	708281540636069889	2016-03-11T13:20:53	7) But rallying around Trump invites a turnout collapse among up-market Republicans, who wont vote D, but cant vote Trump.
davidfrum	708281330300104704	2016-03-11T13:20:03	6) Splitting the party can escalate what might otherwise by a 53-47 Hillary Clinton win into a 53-40-7 Hillary Clinton landslide
davidfrum	708280999814103041	2016-03-11T13:18:44	5) Such a decision presents an agonizing balance of risks to practical Republican politicians
davidfrum	708280592605925377	2016-03-11T13:17:07	4) Rather as liberals repulsed by Jimmy Carter rallied around John Anderson in 1980…
davidfrum	708280424905093120	2016-03-11T13:16:27	3) Anti-Trump GOPers will then have to consider: finding some ballot line for a “true conservative” independent candidacy.
davidfrum	708280016237268994	2016-03-11T13:14:49	2) If that result holds, it’s over not only for Rubio and Cruz - but also almost certainly for plans to halt Trump at convention.
davidfrum	708279704688599040	2016-03-11T13:13:35	1) Post Miami debate (and per RCP polls) Tuesday seems likely to see Trump win Florida (Cruz 3d), and finish 1 or 2 in Ohio (Cruz again 3d)

davidfrum	708277292263350273	2016-03-11T13:04:00	Even more astounding: the last mainstream GOP hopes of stopping Trump all depend on the 1 Republican governor who accepted Obamacare.
davidfrum	708276954466652160	2016-03-11T13:02:39	Will be fascinating to see which GOPers submit to Trump - Gingrich next? - and which resist, if any …

davidfrum	696348499282153472	2016-02-07T15:03:14	Great piece by JohnSununu in this mornings ConMonitorNews 
davidfrum	696341222034550784	2016-02-07T14:34:19	- over to you, Mr. Algorithm
davidfrum	696341109119676418	2016-02-07T14:33:52	20) The world instantly tests new presidents. Nobody can be fully ready. But some are more ready; some are less - and less is dangerous
davidfrum	696339858395009025	2016-02-07T14:28:54	19) It was unnerving - and what has Rubio offered over this campaign to calm those nerves when they twitch?
davidfrum	696339631214710785	2016-02-07T14:28:00	18) Last night, they got a maybe unfair glimpse of the kind of president he’d be when the pressure was on.
davidfrum	696339446786949120	2016-02-07T14:27:16	17) Republicans are asked to nominate an unknown quantity who has not offered useful information to predict the kind of president he’d be
davidfrum	696339325831684096	2016-02-07T14:26:47	16) With Rubio, though, Republicans are asked to nominate an unknown quantity - wrong by his own admission on his most important decision.
davidfrum	696338968393027584	2016-02-07T14:25:22	15) But yes, the lack of experience in Obama was grounds for worry. That’s why Obama added Biden to the ticket.
davidfrum	696338666768044033	2016-02-07T14:24:10	14) Obama had laid out his whole philosophy of life in a massive, highly self-aware and very revealing memoir.
davidfrum	696338454704054272	2016-02-07T14:23:19	13) Candidate Obama in 2008 was dangerously untested yes , but he was obviously a man of profound depths.
davidfrum	696338317147664384	2016-02-07T14:22:46	12) Rubio has gotten away with his glibness because of persistent R under-estimation of Barack Obama.
davidfrum	696338109944868864	2016-02-07T14:21:57	11) Was he merely a personable front man? Was he outwitted by Chuck Schumer? What did he learn from what he himself now describes as error?
davidfrum	696337717462851584	2016-02-07T14:20:23	10) Worse, Rubio’s explanations re immigration raise questions about how well he ever understood what he was doing 
davidfrum	696337259218366464	2016-02-07T14:18:34	9) Phyllis Schlafly here massively documents how wrong (from an R point of view) Rubio was 
davidfrum	696337038178590720	2016-02-07T14:17:41	8) On the central question of 2016, immigration, Rubio got the answer massively wrong from a Republican point of view
davidfrum	696336906016018432	2016-02-07T14:17:10	7) The question D voters were asking in 2008 was : who’d opposed the Iraq war? Obama had little record - but it was the right record for Ds
davidfrum	696336723983208449	2016-02-07T14:16:26	6) Voters have pitifully little information about him. In this way, Rubio is NOT like Obama at all.
davidfrum	696336583197200384	2016-02-07T14:15:53	5) The big question about Rubio is: can this untested novice cope with the demands of the presidency?
davidfrum	696336046552842240	2016-02-07T14:13:45	4) Faced with a genuinely new situation, Rubio could not figure out what to do …. and so stumbled into doing precisely the wrong thing
davidfrum	696335880504549376	2016-02-07T14:13:05	3) By contrast, Rubio’s 4x repeat was not an act of excessive message discipline. It was a display of panic at a moment of uncertainty
davidfrum	696335311610118145	2016-02-07T14:10:50	2) But the normal reason to adhere to talking points is determination to advance a controlled message - and to avoid an unhelpful quotation
davidfrum	696335146593587200	2016-02-07T14:10:10	1) Politicians often repeat talking points. Friend portraitinflesh forwards this richly comic example of the genre
