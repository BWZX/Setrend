sherman4949	683781028851351553	2016-01-03T22:44:35	Is it more fitting of this 49ers season for the team to lose to the Rams at home or win a meaningless game and ruin a prime draft slot?
sherman4949	683730427895517184	2016-01-03T19:23:31	Sort of hoping all 9 games go Colts' way and they don't make playoffs because they lose their own game
sherman4949	683722981202374656	2016-01-03T18:53:56	tim_bays got millions of dollars. Don't feel that bad for him.

sherman4949	683722622488698880	2016-01-03T18:52:30	jswartz he can draft defense -- just needs an offensive HC to help him with the other 50% of football
sherman4949	683721622029746177	2016-01-03T18:48:32	49ers should really just sit Bowman today. 
sherman4949	683719447807442944	2016-01-03T18:39:53	tim_bays @Kyle_McLorgBASG Losing that Browns game was probably the best thing that's happened to the team since '13
sherman4949	683718431594643456	2016-01-03T18:35:51	tim_bays @Kyle_McLorgBASG 75 percent empty stadium and a banner saying hold York accountable helps. Bravo 49ers fans.

sherman4949	683716650114412544	2016-01-03T18:28:46	Hue seems like a great choice -- need to bring offensive creativity back to SF. 
sherman4949	683716416277745665	2016-01-03T18:27:51	jswartz Not this year. Baalke needs to pick the HC. Probably better than York picking a GM to pick the HC. One more yr for Trent. Last shot
sherman4949	683715578016706561	2016-01-03T18:24:31	@Kyle_McLorgBASG he mentioned second. No way Baalke gives up first
sherman4949	683715366913224705	2016-01-03T18:23:40	@Kyle_McLorgBASG same no 1 and no 2, in that order. glazer suggested it may take a draft pick to lure Payton from NO
sherman4949	683681974159028225	2016-01-03T16:10:59	@Kyle_McLorgBASG I don't think so. Tomsula firing is to prevent fan base war. Think pick will be a fan favorite - Holmgren, Shanny, Etc
sherman4949	683679114461622273	2016-01-03T15:59:37	SethWickersham Today seems like a good day though - admit defeat and start again
sherman4949	683677911065456641	2016-01-03T15:54:50	Let's be honest - York will fire Tomsula to prevent all-out revolt from fan base. Has to fire him to avoid getting truly irreversibly ugly

sherman4949	683659754191884288	2016-01-03T14:42:41	Would imagine Niners interview Hue Jackson, Mangini, Holmgren, Kelly, Austin, Gase again, McDaniel - probably skew toward offense-minded HC

sherman4949	683651709323874304	2016-01-03T14:10:43	Kelly or Holmgren? Or can we convince Gase/Fangio we made a huge mistake?
