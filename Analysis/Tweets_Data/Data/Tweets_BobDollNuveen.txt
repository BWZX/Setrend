BobDollNuveen	726184730887081984	2016-04-29T23:01:46	I expect first qtr earnings will decline year-over-year but think they should improve in the second half of the yr 
BobDollNuveen	726169672287182848	2016-04-29T22:01:56	HY spreads have been volatile recently, but I think this is an asset class that should do relatively well 
BobDollNuveen	726146803452776448	2016-04-29T20:31:03	When the Fed gets closer to hiking rates (probably this summer), that could disrupt equity markets. 
BobDollNuveen	726131789694160897	2016-04-29T19:31:24	U.S. economic growth should bounce back in the second quarter, helped by consumer spending and manufacturing. 
BobDollNuveen	726116640358862849	2016-04-29T18:31:12	Both corporate earnings and economic growth are mixed, but should improve as 2016 progresses. 
BobDollNuveen	726109364478693376	2016-04-29T18:02:17	With the economy accelerating &amp; inflation slowly rising, I expect the Fed to stay on track to slowly raise rates 
BobDollNuveen	726079357719044096	2016-04-29T16:03:03	Video: Here’s a look at some of the key investment themes in the Large Cap Equity Series: 
BobDollNuveen	726064121851031552	2016-04-29T15:02:30	1Q may be the 15th in a row where domestically-oriented US corp earnings outpace international-focused companies: 
BobDollNuveen	726037250354626564	2016-04-29T13:15:44	Commodity-oriented sector recovery has been a key market story (and is working against one of my predictions) 
BobDollNuveen	725822273794510848	2016-04-28T23:01:29	Once earnings and global growth get back on track, we expect equity leadership will shift toward non-U.S. stocks. 
BobDollNuveen	725803153602568193	2016-04-28T21:45:31	I expected 2016 would be a good year for high yield bonds. They have rallied nicely over the past few months 
BobDollNuveen	725761689279422464	2016-04-28T19:00:45	Despite a weak GDP reading this morning, I still expect the Fed will persist with its modest interest-rate-increase campaign.
BobDollNuveen	725751463264280576	2016-04-28T18:20:07	As expected, 1Q GDP growth was quite weak. I think we’ll see a bounce back in 2Q as consumer spending and manufacturing improves.
BobDollNuveen	725731909884624896	2016-04-28T17:02:25	1Q domestically-oriented earnings should drop 3% while internationally-focused earnings could fall 14%. 
BobDollNuveen	725716976539193344	2016-04-28T16:03:05	The soonest I expect to see improved earnings is the second half of 2016. More insights in my Q1 video update: 
BobDollNuveen	725693898908114944	2016-04-28T14:31:22	China should avoid a hard landing, but slowing growth should act as a deflationary force on the global economy. 
BobDollNuveen	725663642155372544	2016-04-28T12:31:09	I expect the Fed will raise rates two times in 2016. That’s one more time than market expectations. 
BobDollNuveen	725444899584262144	2016-04-27T22:01:56	As long as economic data continue to improve, I expect the Fed will raise rates probably two times in 2016. Video: 
BobDollNuveen	725422058608451584	2016-04-27T20:31:11	Markets may remain choppy for some time, but I expect equities should outperform over the long term. 
BobDollNuveen	725403067995291649	2016-04-27T19:15:43	Energy remains a drag on corporate earnings. Overall, 1Q EPS looks to be down 5%, but would be up 1% ex-energy. 
BobDollNuveen	725376792677220353	2016-04-27T17:31:18	In hindsight, it seems evident that investors were overly pessimistic about the state of the economy early in 2016 
BobDollNuveen	725346696167870465	2016-04-27T15:31:43	Over the coming months, I expect economic improvements will put additional upward pressure on rates. 
BobDollNuveen	725327579700449281	2016-04-27T14:15:45	Important economic signal: We may be seeing improvements in manufacturing data. Video on what that means: 
BobDollNuveen	725309063991558145	2016-04-27T13:02:11	The current equity rally seems to be driven by more stability in China &amp; a more dovish Fed. Can these trends last? 
BobDollNuveen	725074765128568833	2016-04-26T21:31:09	I think the back-and-forth we have seen in equity prices is likely to persist until we see more economic clarity. 
BobDollNuveen	725052287417221122	2016-04-26T20:01:50	Equity leadership may move toward non-US markets but not until investors are more confident in the global economy 
BobDollNuveen	725044570854187008	2016-04-26T19:31:11	I think the weeks-long trend of U.S. dollar weakness may soon come to an end. Here’s why: 
BobDollNuveen	725022215700418560	2016-04-26T18:02:21	I think we are in a year where it will be tough to have either a big move up or down for stocks. Here’s why: 
BobDollNuveen	724992211746742273	2016-04-26T16:03:07	So far this year, I’m wrong on my prediction that stocks will outperform bonds, but I’m expecting that to change. 
BobDollNuveen	724961729650802689	2016-04-26T14:02:00	I think there is a disconnect between current low yields and the reality of the economic and inflation picture. 
BobDollNuveen	724938825106087937	2016-04-26T12:30:59	1Q GDP data will be released on Thursday. I’m expecting it will show 1% real growth at best. 
BobDollNuveen	724731025998356480	2016-04-25T22:45:16	It’s early, but so far 1Q corporate earnings are looking pretty decent. I’m not sure that will continue. 
BobDollNuveen	724712214544920577	2016-04-25T21:30:31	Equities are currently near the top of their recent trading range. Here’s my thoughts on where stocks are headed: 
BobDollNuveen	724693374800900096	2016-04-25T20:15:39	The uncertain U.S. political backdrop presents some risks for investors. 
BobDollNuveen	724674509123493888	2016-04-25T19:00:41	In my opinion, Treasuries and other government bonds may be vulnerable as rates are likely to rise. 
BobDollNuveen	724659378687737856	2016-04-25T18:00:34	Another week, another gain for equities. What will it take for this trend to continue? 
BobDollNuveen	724645429720285188	2016-04-25T17:05:08	Today’s commentary now available: “Earnings Remain Key to Equity Forecast.” 
BobDollNuveen	724629722496380929	2016-04-25T16:02:43	Video: The last few months have been a wild ride for stocks. My views on what investors can expect from here: 
BobDollNuveen	724576490516520960	2016-04-25T12:31:11	Somewhat surprisingly, U.S. stocks have remained a relative safe haven and have been outperforming global markets. 
BobDollNuveen	723632843889487872	2016-04-22T22:01:29	At the beginning of 2016, I expected the year to be a tough one for investors. The first qtr bore that theme out. 
BobDollNuveen	723610091606446081	2016-04-22T20:31:04	Two ingredients for better equity markets: Ongoing global economic improvements and rising investor confidence 
BobDollNuveen	723587798670938112	2016-04-22T19:02:29	Rising labor costs have become a big economic story. That brings with it some positives and some negatives. 
BobDollNuveen	723572210821173248	2016-04-22T18:00:33	The US economy is battling a number of crosscurrents. But I think growth will improve as the yr progresses. Video: 
BobDollNuveen	723564846474768384	2016-04-22T17:31:17	One of my 2016 predictions that’s looking correct: My forecast that the federal budget deficit would rise this yr 
BobDollNuveen	723527420507205632	2016-04-22T15:02:34	If (and it’s a big if) corporate earnings improve later this year, that should provide a tailwind for equities. 
BobDollNuveen	723500507051003904	2016-04-22T13:15:37	We’ve seen five consecutive quarters of flat-to-negative corporate earnings. Here’s my view on what’s coming: 
BobDollNuveen	723277847054393347	2016-04-21T22:30:51	2016 10 Predictions Update: 5 heading in the right direction, 2 in the wrong one, and 3 too early to call: 
BobDollNuveen	723256176864010240	2016-04-21T21:04:44	Data from the latest Federal Reserve beige book showed some positives and suggest growth could accelerate. 
BobDollNuveen	723240536988090368	2016-04-21T20:02:35	Rising prices and wages will constrain the Fed at some point, but for now it can continue to move slowly. 
BobDollNuveen	723225399275208709	2016-04-21T19:02:26	Financial market conditions improved in recent months. Thanks in part to more pro-growth central bank policies. 
BobDollNuveen	723198531801112576	2016-04-21T17:15:41	Wages are rising. That helps consumer spending, but may cause issues for corporate earnings. 
BobDollNuveen	723168320749449216	2016-04-21T15:15:38	In this week’s commentary, I discuss reasons for a modest pro-growth investment stance. 
BobDollNuveen	723134800652066816	2016-04-21T13:02:26	Some 1Q economic negatives: A deteriorating trade balance, declining inventories &amp; falling auto sales. 
BobDollNuveen	722934227097034752	2016-04-20T23:45:25	I think finding investments that work is going to remain a struggle. Here are some themes to consider. 
BobDollNuveen	722915469162713090	2016-04-20T22:30:53	In my view, the economic backdrop and valuations favor equities over bonds. But I expect near-term volatility: 
BobDollNuveen	722878229250457600	2016-04-20T20:02:54	Some evidence suggests US manufacturing is on an uptick. That would be great news for the economy 
BobDollNuveen	722858806343024640	2016-04-20T18:45:44	March’s retail sales levels were surprisingly disappointing. Rising wages &amp; jobs increases should cause a rebound 
BobDollNuveen	722836145017614336	2016-04-20T17:15:41	Average hourly earnings growth is approaching its fastest pace in five years. Here’s what that means: 
BobDollNuveen	722807141745172480	2016-04-20T15:20:26	So far this year, equity markets ran hard and got nowhere. 2016 will likely be frustrating for both bulls &amp; bears. 
BobDollNuveen	722787295364038657	2016-04-20T14:01:34	The U.S. economy is hardly booming, but it is doing better than the rest of the world. 
BobDollNuveen	722768154695483392	2016-04-20T12:45:31	Since last summer, stocks have had 2 double-digit declines &amp; recoveries. Not surprising sentiment remains shaky. 
BobDollNuveen	722537972332109824	2016-04-19T21:30:51	Manufacturing levels remain mixed, but some earlier headwinds (such as the stronger dollar) may be fading 
BobDollNuveen	722515563134775299	2016-04-19T20:01:48	It looks to me like 1Q US real GDP growth may come in at less than 1%. That number should improve later this yr. 
BobDollNuveen	722492798616891393	2016-04-19T18:31:21	The prospect of the U.K. leaving the EU presents some risks, but I think a “Brexit” is unlikely. 
BobDollNuveen	722455322472902660	2016-04-19T16:02:26	It may take time, but I expect investor sentiment will improve in the coming months 
BobDollNuveen	722424987643219969	2016-04-19T14:01:53	The key variable for equities remains the corporate earnings picture. I think it may brighten later in 2016. 
BobDollNuveen	722402087594811393	2016-04-19T12:30:53	I think U.S. economic growth is slow, but I expect will accelerate in the coming quarters. 
BobDollNuveen	722198424989392897	2016-04-18T23:01:36	Possible downside risks for stocks: Valuations look less compelling &amp; revenues are under pressure. More here: 
BobDollNuveen	722171727707553792	2016-04-18T21:15:31	With equity markets facing a tough path, security selection will be increasingly critical this year. 
BobDollNuveen	722160429481517056	2016-04-18T20:30:38	Last week’s markets: Bank stocks experienced their best week in over four years. 
BobDollNuveen	722133928094658561	2016-04-18T18:45:19	It’s early in the season, but last week saw some pretty good earnings results. That might not last. 
BobDollNuveen	722108087746838528	2016-04-18T17:02:38	Inflation appears to be rising, but remains below the Fed’s 2% target level, giving the central bank flexibility. 
BobDollNuveen	722092460030222336	2016-04-18T16:00:32	This week’s commentary now available: “Expect Economic and Market Improvements Later in 2016.” 
BobDollNuveen	722039837092614144	2016-04-18T12:31:26	A market trend that some may have missed: Value styles have begun outperforming momentum. Will that continue? 
BobDollNuveen	721096202322886656	2016-04-15T22:01:46	Equity positives: over the past couple of months, global economic conditions improved &amp; credit spreads narrowed 
BobDollNuveen	721073417345175552	2016-04-15T20:31:14	Strong sentiment, rising savings &amp; spending suggest the US consumer may be the healthiest it’s been in years: 
BobDollNuveen	721054407392149504	2016-04-15T19:15:41	It’s hard to make a case for equity valuations to expand. That means price improvements will depend on earnings. 
BobDollNuveen	721016647461572608	2016-04-15T16:45:39	Consumers are spending, but also are saving more. That complicates the outlook for the consumer sector: 
BobDollNuveen	720998023577395200	2016-04-15T15:31:38	The trend of negative interest rates presents more long-term problems than any potential near-term relief. 
BobDollNuveen	720978909412618240	2016-04-15T14:15:41	I think (&amp; hope) that corp earnings will improve over the second half of 2016. Otherwise, equities will struggle 
BobDollNuveen	720956231188377604	2016-04-15T12:45:34	Manufacturing appears to be moving past foreign weakness and the secular decline in oil prices. 
BobDollNuveen	720729727972020224	2016-04-14T21:45:32	Investor risk aversion remains high, which helps explain why government bond yields remain so low. 
BobDollNuveen	720711006364811264	2016-04-14T20:31:08	In my view, investors require more economic clarity before equity prices can experience a sustained advance. 
BobDollNuveen	720684471289266176	2016-04-14T18:45:42	Wages have been rising slowly, but since inflation is low, any increase is good news for the consumer sector. 
BobDollNuveen	720661817962426368	2016-04-14T17:15:41	Some good economic news: The labor participation rate is growing at its fastest pace since 2007. Details: 
BobDollNuveen	720635573074006017	2016-04-14T15:31:24	To date, most of the weakness in earnings has centered around energy. It looks like negatives may be broadening 
BobDollNuveen	720613186693677056	2016-04-14T14:02:26	Periodic market setbacks are probably inevitable until more market clarity emerges. What will it take 
BobDollNuveen	720374875895046144	2016-04-13T22:15:28	I think the long-term outlook for equities is positive. But only if corporate earnings recover. 
BobDollNuveen	720348604209197057	2016-04-13T20:31:05	Good jobs news: Payroll employment is now over 5 million above the 2008 peak. The labor market is showing strength 
BobDollNuveen	720322085692674049	2016-04-13T18:45:42	I’m not expecting a hard landing in China, but the country’s economy is clearly weakening. 
BobDollNuveen	720288299911397376	2016-04-13T16:31:27	I think the biggest risk to the US economy is prospects of negative credit related events in energy-related areas: 
BobDollNuveen	720261644564238336	2016-04-13T14:45:32	Despite the market rebound since mid-Feb, investor confidence remains fragile. What will it take to change that? 
BobDollNuveen	720235787426598912	2016-04-13T13:02:47	Early in 2016 some feared the Fed may raise rates 4 times or more. The expectations downgrade has helped equities 
BobDollNuveen	720027577323229184	2016-04-12T23:15:26	The U.S. is hardly seeing booming economic conditions, but it remains better positioned than the rest of the world 
BobDollNuveen	720004946033274880	2016-04-12T21:45:30	As part of my recent 10 Predictions update, I include a list of themes investors may want to consider: 
BobDollNuveen	719963976864514048	2016-04-12T19:02:43	Equity outlook: I have a constructive long-term view. In the short-term, things look less clear. What to do? 
BobDollNuveen	719937013504413696	2016-04-12T17:15:34	In January, many investors feared a collapse in U.S. and Chinese manufacturing. Those concerns have since faded: 
BobDollNuveen	719903405649629185	2016-04-12T15:02:01	1Q earnings outlook: We already saw two quarters of declines. Unfortunately it looks like 1Q will be number three 
BobDollNuveen	719880579517444096	2016-04-12T13:31:19	Ironically, equities experienced double-digit moves down &amp; up in 1Q but ended almost flat. A look at the numbers: 
BobDollNuveen	719672682686627841	2016-04-11T23:45:13	One negative for the U.S. economy: Overseas weakness is dragging down export-related industries. 
BobDollNuveen	719646415857782784	2016-04-11T22:00:50	Despite pockets of weakness, the U.S. economy has improved over the past couple of months. Read more: 
BobDollNuveen	719616530741399557	2016-04-11T20:02:05	The US manufacturing sector has struggled due to weak overseas growth &amp; the oil/dollar dynamic. Is that changing? 
BobDollNuveen	719597190113599489	2016-04-11T18:45:14	Oil prices have been rising due to potential production cuts and a realization that the economy is improving 
BobDollNuveen	719571992186396673	2016-04-11T17:05:06	This week’s commentary now available: “Potential Earnings Improvements Remain a Critical Catalyst.” 
BobDollNuveen	719525998488903680	2016-04-11T14:02:20	The prospects for more oil market volatility is a potential negative for equities. But there are positives as well 
BobDollNuveen	719495721737711620	2016-04-11T12:02:02	Since the start of 2015, monthly jobs growth has averaged over 200,000. Strong sign that the economy is improving 
BobDollNuveen	718544121712001025	2016-04-08T21:00:43	Looking back at 1Q: Equities went on a wild ride, but how much really changed during the quarter? 
BobDollNuveen	718521407496396800	2016-04-08T19:30:27	Global economic view: The U.S. appears to be improving, but many areas of the world are struggling. 
BobDollNuveen	718491188353974272	2016-04-08T17:30:22	Our latest update to my 2016 Ten Predictions: “Markets Remain Rocky as Investors Await Clarity” 
BobDollNuveen	718469257009500160	2016-04-08T16:03:14	I don’t expect to see a sustained uptrend in stock prices until investors grow more confident about the economy. 
BobDollNuveen	718431103061737472	2016-04-08T13:31:37	The global economy remains rocky and is still dependent on supportive monetary policy in some regions. 
BobDollNuveen	718174306262499329	2016-04-07T20:31:12	Despite some risks to the market, we continue to have a constructive long-term view toward stocks. 
BobDollNuveen	718136886200569856	2016-04-07T18:02:30	Weak overseas growth is acting as a drag on the U.S. economy, but the U.S. is still growing slowly. 
BobDollNuveen	718098887807004674	2016-04-07T15:31:31	March’s ISM Manufacturing Index ticked up to over 50 and reached its highest level since last July. 
BobDollNuveen	718061406600437761	2016-04-07T13:02:34	Over the past few weeks, we’ve heard some conflicting comments from Fed officials. My take on the rates picture: 
BobDollNuveen	717819619071946756	2016-04-06T21:01:48	The manufacturing sector may finally be shifting into a higher gear. I think oil stability &amp; a lower dollar help 
BobDollNuveen	717789593614028800	2016-04-06T19:02:29	High levels of new jobs created &amp; a static unemployment rate show more Americans are entering the labor force 
BobDollNuveen	717770307898118145	2016-04-06T17:45:51	I expect to see another negative quarter for corporate earnings for 1Q. But results should improve later this yr 
BobDollNuveen	717714344327389184	2016-04-06T14:03:28	Labor market data suggest the U.S. economy remains in solid (although not stellar) shape. 
BobDollNuveen	717449522255933440	2016-04-05T20:31:10	At least some of the recent rebound in equity prices has come about from short covering. What that means: 
BobDollNuveen	717419310076006402	2016-04-05T18:31:07	My best guess for 1Q GDP is around 2% as the positives are held back by some persistent negatives. 
BobDollNuveen	717385216973733888	2016-04-05T16:15:38	It’s looking less likely that oil producers will come to an agreement about a production freeze. 
BobDollNuveen	717351748466290693	2016-04-05T14:02:39	Corp earnings are struggling. Absent improvements (which should come), it’s hard to make a case for equities climbing much higher.
BobDollNuveen	717328657820303360	2016-04-05T12:30:54	Expectations for 1Q earnings are low, but for now investors are focusing on the positives. 
BobDollNuveen	717102084462612480	2016-04-04T21:30:34	Janet Yellen’s comments last week clearly indicate the Fed is in no hurry to raise rates. 
BobDollNuveen	717079503546290177	2016-04-04T20:00:50	Equities resumed their rally last week. Here’s my thoughts about what to expect in the coming weeks and months. 
BobDollNuveen	717049626428358656	2016-04-04T18:02:07	I think there is a very low chance of the Fed acting in April. June still feels like the most likely timeframe for an increase.
BobDollNuveen	717019002808172544	2016-04-04T16:00:26	This week’s commentary now available: “The Positives Outweigh the Negatives for the U.S. Economy.” 
BobDollNuveen	716981496867909632	2016-04-04T13:31:24	How have market conditions affected the way I have been managing the Large Cap Equity Series over the past 3 yrs: 
BobDollNuveen	716003590343684096	2016-04-01T20:45:33	The weaker dollar may have removed some risk from the economy and global financial markets. Reasons why: 
BobDollNuveen	715977713618653185	2016-04-01T19:02:43	At some point, rising wages and prices will constrain Fed action, but for now it can still move slowly. 
BobDollNuveen	715954757702180864	2016-04-01T17:31:30	Video: Some current investment themes and approaches within the Large Cap Equity Series: 
BobDollNuveen	715926729467015168	2016-04-01T15:40:08	Recent Fed statements suggest it is focused on overseas issues. If just the US economy was in focus, I think rates would be higher.
BobDollNuveen	715902212233408512	2016-04-01T14:02:42	For now, corporate earnings are struggling. That may have to change to see a long-term uptrend in equities. 
BobDollNuveen	715660401212522496	2016-03-31T22:01:50	What will it take for equity markets to experience long-term better conditions? Here’s some things to watch for: 
BobDollNuveen	715637596953649152	2016-03-31T20:31:13	Looks to me like the U.S. is (finally) seeing some benefits from stimulative forces that emerged last year. 
BobDollNuveen	715603483542552576	2016-03-31T18:15:40	I think rising oil prices and the falling dollar are good indicators for future equity prices. Insight here: 
BobDollNuveen	715570081430904832	2016-03-31T16:02:56	January and February ISM manufacturing levels climbed. I think we may see the same occur for March data. 
BobDollNuveen	715547058820788224	2016-03-31T14:31:27	At 25 basis pts, I think the fed funds rate is inconsistent w/ the current economic backdrop. It should be higher 
BobDollNuveen	715267888689577984	2016-03-30T20:02:08	The U.S. economy appears to be solidifying and data points to a stronger long-term environment for stocks. 
BobDollNuveen	715245081486356481	2016-03-30T18:31:30	At some point, oil prices will probably experience another downturn. That could be a negative for investors. 
BobDollNuveen	715226000968323073	2016-03-30T17:15:41	Despite (or maybe because of) the recent strong rally in stocks, investor sentiment remains depressed.

BobDollNuveen	715177356231634945	2016-03-30T14:02:23	Although I think broad conditions are improving, I remain cautious about the near-term outlook for stocks. 
BobDollNuveen	714924003480219648	2016-03-29T21:15:39	Terrorism has unfortunately become a fact of life, but financial markets have historically been resilient. 
BobDollNuveen	714905409992146945	2016-03-29T20:01:46	The Fed’s recent policy statements may provide some additional certainty for financial markets. Read more: 
BobDollNuveen	714878681240494082	2016-03-29T18:15:34	Several important risk factors seem less pressing than they did a couple of months ago. Details here: 
BobDollNuveen	714849751628439553	2016-03-29T16:20:36	U.S. economic data suggests we may see an eventual improvement in corporate earnings results. Details: 
BobDollNuveen	714830096981426176	2016-03-29T15:02:30	Fed rate hikes in 2016? My best guess is the first will be in June with one or two more later in the year. Video: 
BobDollNuveen	714814850048851968	2016-03-29T14:01:55	There is a sense among some investors that the equity rally we have experienced since mid-February may be overdone 
BobDollNuveen	714561538020007936	2016-03-28T21:15:21	Besides a short-lived move to safe haven assets, markets haven’t had much of a reaction to recent terrorism events 
BobDollNuveen	714535376795406336	2016-03-28T19:31:23	What’s behind the recent gain in oil prices? Mostly oversold conditions and slowing production. Video here: 
BobDollNuveen	714504928568324096	2016-03-28T17:30:24	Equities snapped their five-week winning streak. Here’s a look behind the numbers. 
BobDollNuveen	714487242765545473	2016-03-28T16:20:07	This week’s commentary now available: “Conditions Are Improving, but Investors Remain Skeptical.” 
BobDollNuveen	714429556283846657	2016-03-28T12:30:54	We’ve already seen huge declines &amp; gains in equities this yr. That sort of frustrating back-and-forth may persist 
BobDollNuveen	713085781947129861	2016-03-24T19:31:13	Recent data suggest inflation is slowly rising, but not yet to a level that will cause problems. 
BobDollNuveen	713063442081587201	2016-03-24T18:02:27	Consumer sector outlook: Sentiment is high, savings have increased &amp; Americans are spending at a sustainable pace 
BobDollNuveen	713018155644362752	2016-03-24T15:02:30	The Fed is clearly erring on the side of caution and does not want to make a mistake by tightening too quickly. 
BobDollNuveen	712987954839420928	2016-03-24T13:02:29	Long-term, I’m positive on equities. But I am growing cautious about the near-term outlook. 
BobDollNuveen	712761343594598402	2016-03-23T22:02:01	The Philly Fed manufacturing index rose to its highest level in over a year. Manufacturing weakness may be fading 
BobDollNuveen	712738476261773312	2016-03-23T20:31:09	Consumer spending remains a source of strength for the U.S. economy. That’s a trend that is unlikely to change. 
BobDollNuveen	712711935452688384	2016-03-23T18:45:41	I think the odds of a U.S. recession are extremely low, unless we see some sort of global crisis. 
BobDollNuveen	712689293995675648	2016-03-23T17:15:43	The Fed is suggesting it will raise rates only twice this yr. I predict the next one will take place in June. 
BobDollNuveen	712647922740039680	2016-03-23T14:31:19	The corporate earnings outlook has improved a bit over the past month due to stabilizing oil &amp; a falling dollar. 
BobDollNuveen	712617682970021888	2016-03-23T12:31:10	A key economic number I’m watching: Waiting to see when the U.S. ISM Manufacturing Index rises above 50. 
BobDollNuveen	712398869565448197	2016-03-22T22:01:40	In this week’s commentary, I include a list of economic/market themes that have changed over the past month: 
BobDollNuveen	712372223030517762	2016-03-22T20:15:47	There’s a bearish case to be made about the economy and stocks, but the list of worries hasn’t materialized yet. 
BobDollNuveen	712338549731889152	2016-03-22T18:01:59	Core CPI is up 3.0% on a 3 month basis. Looks like the improving labor market and rising oil are having an effect. 
BobDollNuveen	712315696382873602	2016-03-22T16:31:10	It is possible stock prices have come too far too fast. I wouldn’t be surprised to see some sort of consolidation. 
BobDollNuveen	712285463936167937	2016-03-22T14:31:02	In my view, the U.S. consumer sector is in the best shape it has been in several years. Details: 
BobDollNuveen	712263352328851456	2016-03-22T13:03:11	Leverage allows portfolio managers to invest more than 100% of their assets. Explanation here: 
BobDollNuveen	712036272559267845	2016-03-21T22:00:51	Last week’s statement from the Fed was more dovish than anticipated and adds to the list of positives for stocks. 
BobDollNuveen	712013532989145088	2016-03-21T20:30:29	U.S. economic data continue to improve, but I think we still need to see better results from manufacturing 
BobDollNuveen	711990948142702594	2016-03-21T19:00:44	Equities advanced for a fifth consecutive week &amp; are now in positive territory for the year. What to expect next? 
BobDollNuveen	711968191891836928	2016-03-21T17:30:19	This week’s commentary now available: “Dovish Monetary Policy Signs Push Risk Assets Higher.” 
BobDollNuveen	711931155902242816	2016-03-21T15:03:09	Alpha, beta, gross and net exposure. What they mean and how they work together in alternative investing: 
BobDollNuveen	711916013730795520	2016-03-21T14:02:59	“Alternative investing” is often misunderstood. I consider it a set of tools to manage risk &amp; add value. Details: 
BobDollNuveen	710934304327606272	2016-03-18T21:02:01	I expect risk assets will continue to be buffeted by a slew of crosscurrents as investors await  economic clarity 
BobDollNuveen	710911527746998272	2016-03-18T19:31:30	How can using shorts in a portfolio potentially add value? My view and approach here: 
BobDollNuveen	710874076831731712	2016-03-18T17:02:41	I’m not sure how long the oil rally can continue unabated. That’s a possible risk for stock prices. 
BobDollNuveen	710851108277755905	2016-03-18T15:31:25	As long as economic growth continues to improve, I think value areas of the stock market will do well. 
BobDollNuveen	710828912012627968	2016-03-18T14:03:13	In a long-only portfolio, some research is, in effect, “wasted.” But there are ways to avoid that: 
BobDollNuveen	710805787455692801	2016-03-18T12:31:20	In my view, the U.S. economy is improving. I expect to see an acceleration in consumer spending in 1Q GDP data. 
BobDollNuveen	710587017273450496	2016-03-17T22:02:01	With the recent price increase, equity valuations look a bit less attractive than they did a month ago. 
BobDollNuveen	710557016872321025	2016-03-17T20:02:48	Shorting companies is not the same thing as looking for bankruptcy candidates. It’s about relative performance: 
BobDollNuveen	710530048210690052	2016-03-17T18:15:39	Unless the U.S. slips into a recession (unlikely), high yield spreads should continue to narrow. 
BobDollNuveen	710503844044734465	2016-03-17T16:31:31	As the ECB’s actions last week show, global monetary policy remains accommodative—a plus for risk assets. 
BobDollNuveen	710473611866464256	2016-03-17T14:31:23	In some ways, conditions have improved over the past month (economic data are better &amp; China risks have faded). 
BobDollNuveen	710452027348881408	2016-03-17T13:05:37	I think the long-term outlook for stocks is solid. The short-term outlook is murkier. 
BobDollNuveen	710216909380329472	2016-03-16T21:31:21	I manage three alternative strategies as part of our Large Cap Equity Series. How they work: 
BobDollNuveen	710194478510956544	2016-03-16T20:02:13	Last week’s ECB easing package exceeded expectations, but the announcement caused some investor confusion: 
BobDollNuveen	710179604745601024	2016-03-16T19:03:06	What are 130/30, market neutral and long/short strategies? And what benefits &amp; risks do they offer? 
BobDollNuveen	710160093103394817	2016-03-16T17:45:34	Despite (or perhaps because of) the recent equity rally, investor skepticism remains high. 
BobDollNuveen	710141483853152257	2016-03-16T16:31:38	If a portfolio manager believes a company will underperform the market, what can they do about it? 
BobDollNuveen	710103898149756930	2016-03-16T14:02:17	I expect high yield bonds to continue to outpace the broader bond market. 
BobDollNuveen	709854430859022336	2016-03-15T21:30:59	In the near-term, I think equity markets could experience some sort of price consolidation. 
BobDollNuveen	709831989646458880	2016-03-15T20:01:49	It’s only March and we’ve already seen a double-digit equity decline and advance. I think volatility will continue 
BobDollNuveen	709809264240545793	2016-03-15T18:31:30	How is having a mortgage on your home similar to alternative investing? It’s all about leverage: 
BobDollNuveen	709771681959714816	2016-03-15T16:02:10	During the recent rally, value sectors have outperformed. That’s a trend I expect will continue. 
BobDollNuveen	709748857559769088	2016-03-15T14:31:28	Nuveen’s Large Cap Equity Series includes three “alternative” portfolios. Here’s how they work: 
BobDollNuveen	709718521907961857	2016-03-15T12:30:56	Equity markets are still following the lead from oil for now. As commodity prices stabilize that trend should fade 
BobDollNuveen	709507008249073664	2016-03-14T22:30:27	Since its low on Feb 11, the S&amp;P 500 Index is up 11%. I don’t think that pace will continue. Some risks lie ahead: 
BobDollNuveen	709469315309903872	2016-03-14T20:00:40	Last week marked the fourth consecutive week of equity market gains. Will that continue? My thoughts here: 
BobDollNuveen	709461952511283200	2016-03-14T19:31:25	Confused by the terms “shorting” and “leverage?” This paper helps explain the ins and outs: 
BobDollNuveen	709442756536623104	2016-03-14T18:15:08	Today’s commentary now available: “Equities Advance Again, But Risks Lurk on the Horizon.” 
BobDollNuveen	709416690141032448	2016-03-14T16:31:33	Shorting and leverage provide unique benefits and come with unique risks. 
BobDollNuveen	709364180252491776	2016-03-14T13:02:54	Here are some hypothetical examples of how alternative investing can add or detract from performance: 
BobDollNuveen	708412642646482945	2016-03-11T22:01:50	The odds of a “brexit" appear relatively low. But that doesn’t mean the possibility isn’t worth focusing on: 
BobDollNuveen	708382574171836416	2016-03-11T20:02:21	As long as we don’t see added turmoil in the global financial system, the Fed should continue increasing rates: 
BobDollNuveen	708352446163189760	2016-03-11T18:02:38	We can’t ignore near-term risks, but I still believe equity prices will move higher over the coming year. 
BobDollNuveen	708329481774243841	2016-03-11T16:31:23	Still-low Treasury yields and relatively wide high yield spreads lead me to believe investors are still fearful. 
BobDollNuveen	708307109939650560	2016-03-11T15:02:29	As consumer spending continues to trend higher, I expect to see manufacturing activity recover. 
BobDollNuveen	708284140731441152	2016-03-11T13:31:13	I see virtually no evidence suggesting U.S. economic growth is slowing. Let alone signs of a recession. 
BobDollNuveen	708080410941657088	2016-03-11T00:01:40	US oil production is forecasted to drop slightly in the coming months. That should act as a tailwind for prices. 
BobDollNuveen	708050290143076352	2016-03-10T22:01:58	In my view, there are some weaknesses in the U.S. economy that still need to be overcome (manufacturing is key). 
BobDollNuveen	708020185303818240	2016-03-10T20:02:21	February’s jobs market report showed yet another solid month, even accounting for some negatives. 
BobDollNuveen	707997298165465089	2016-03-10T18:31:24	It appears to me that both inflation and economic growth are slowing moving higher in the U.S. 
BobDollNuveen	707963159957651456	2016-03-10T16:15:45	There’s bearish and bullish cases to be made about the Fed keeping rates low for so long. Our take: 
BobDollNuveen	707952003390042112	2016-03-10T15:31:25	Equities have been on an uptrend recently, but we think we need to see better news for that to continue. 
BobDollNuveen	707914452537057282	2016-03-10T13:02:12	At the recent G20 meeting, policymakers indicated they retain a bias toward policy easing: 
BobDollNuveen	707702971967148032	2016-03-09T23:01:51	I expect equity markets will remain volatile for the time being. Investor sentiment is still depressed. 
BobDollNuveen	707680162838618112	2016-03-09T21:31:13	I don’t expect to see the UK exit the EU, but discussions over the possibility are dragging on sentiment. Details: 
BobDollNuveen	707657909568675842	2016-03-09T20:02:47	High yield spreads have fallen in recent weeks. Is that a signal for equity markets? 
BobDollNuveen	707634986808176640	2016-03-09T18:31:42	We finally saw some good news from the manufacturing sector last week. But headwinds remain: 
BobDollNuveen	707589735796101121	2016-03-09T15:31:54	Current economic growth levels appear inconsistent with a 10-year Treasury yield as low as it is. I expect yields to rise this year
BobDollNuveen	707552129930665984	2016-03-09T13:02:28	Recent market improvements have come about from less bad news. Not necessarily more good news: 
BobDollNuveen	707340814461100032	2016-03-08T23:02:46	Where are we in the bull market? Somewhere in the later innings, but I don’t see the end coming any time soon.
BobDollNuveen	707310762071625728	2016-03-08T21:03:21	The healthcare sector isn’t as cheap as it was last year. There are still some opportunities, but overall I’m neutral on the sector
BobDollNuveen	707272561596493824	2016-03-08T18:31:33	We saw a third week of market gains. My view on what it will take for a rally to become sustained: 
BobDollNuveen	707257580507275264	2016-03-08T17:32:02	My best guess is that oil prices have bottomed (at least for now) and should start to stabilize from here.
BobDollNuveen	707220289751543810	2016-03-08T15:03:51	The turmoil in the oil markets and energy sector could mean we see a ramp-up in M&amp;A activity in those areas.
BobDollNuveen	707196987658084352	2016-03-08T13:31:15	U.S. stock prices have come close to erasing all of the losses they experienced earlier in the year. What’s next? 
BobDollNuveen	706993016439963649	2016-03-08T00:00:45	How many times will the Fed raise rates in 2016? My best guess is two or three increases. 
BobDollNuveen	706963292321927169	2016-03-07T22:02:38	The U.S. political backdrop is more uncertain than usual. That’s probably contributing to negative investor sentiment.
BobDollNuveen	706932544990781440	2016-03-07T20:00:27	Today’s commentary now available: “Equity Prices Advance Again as Negative Signals Diminish.” 
BobDollNuveen	706903094655848448	2016-03-07T18:03:26	A stronger U.S. dollar can be good for the United States in some ways, but I think the value has risen too far, too fast.
BobDollNuveen	706872867087106048	2016-03-07T16:03:19	In the later stages of a bull market (like we are in now), selectivity becomes more key, which is an argument for active management
BobDollNuveen	706857788434206720	2016-03-07T15:03:24	Within the consumer discretionary sector, I like housing companies, home improvement retailers and some auto-related areas.
BobDollNuveen	706834750862987264	2016-03-07T13:31:51	Here’s a new research paper on how alternative investing works and how I implement in the strategies I manage: 
BobDollNuveen	705869310972051456	2016-03-04T21:35:32	It may take some more time, but I think an improvement in global growth will help manufacturing levels. Insight: 
BobDollNuveen	705845842620641281	2016-03-04T20:02:17	Sector preferences: technology (good free cash flow), telecom (solid defensive sector) &amp; some financials &amp; consumer discretionary.
BobDollNuveen	705825347753926657	2016-03-04T18:40:51	I don’t expect a sharp/sustained advance, but I do think equity prices will climb this year. Further insight 
BobDollNuveen	705808095000313857	2016-03-04T17:32:17	U.S. capital expenditures are estimated to decline 5% this year. Ex-energy, that number would be up 4%. Details: 
BobDollNuveen	705785949687562242	2016-03-04T16:04:17	I think more stability in oil prices would help removing some fear and risk from the global financial system: 
BobDollNuveen	705762701096648704	2016-03-04T14:31:55	There’s a decent chance of seeing some sort of (sorely needed) corporate tax reform after this year’s elections. 
BobDollNuveen	705536063289298944	2016-03-03T23:31:20	Recent market trends suggest that the U.S. dollar may have limited upside from here. More details: 
BobDollNuveen	705520719032164352	2016-03-03T22:30:22	The recent rally is somewhat a result of getting less bad news rather than more good news, which means volatility may continue.
BobDollNuveen	705505626126950401	2016-03-03T21:30:23	But as I mentioned, I think less regulation could pave the way for more innovation in American industry (2/2)
BobDollNuveen	705505626059902977	2016-03-03T21:30:23	Good talk with Professor Robert Gordon of Northwestern on SquawkCNBC this am. I agree that long-term productivity is falling (1/2)
BobDollNuveen	705501966328340480	2016-03-03T21:15:51	Despite still-widespread pessimism, US economic data has been improving. Especially when it comes to jobs growth. 
BobDollNuveen	705423343558791168	2016-03-03T16:03:25	Revised GDP numbers showed a strong inventory buildup in 4Q2015. That helps explain recent manufacturing weakness 
BobDollNuveen	705388732300599296	2016-03-03T13:45:53	We think the recent equity bounce is due partly to recovery from oversold conditions. More details: 
BobDollNuveen	705159604246876160	2016-03-02T22:35:25	In this week’s commentary, I offer a list of five factors that could help market conditions improve: 
BobDollNuveen	705136351566548992	2016-03-02T21:03:01	Equities may remain trendless and volatile for some time to come. That’s going to be a frustrating environment. 
BobDollNuveen	705109372020596736	2016-03-02T19:15:49	We think additional clarity surrounding China’s financial and currency trajectory would help investor sentiment. 
BobDollNuveen	705083333076787200	2016-03-02T17:32:21	March’s Fed meeting will be an opportunity for the central bank to reduce expectations for additional tightening 
BobDollNuveen	705045996712099840	2016-03-02T15:03:59	Pessimism is keeping equities and corporate bonds on the defensive. Some ideas about what might change that: 
BobDollNuveen	704803901585932288	2016-03-01T23:01:59	The 4Q GDP upward revision from 0.7% to 1.0% was better than expected and should help reduce recession fears. 
BobDollNuveen	704784690545344512	2016-03-01T21:45:39	Corporate weakness remains concentrated in the energy sector. Outside of that part of the market conditions are OK 
BobDollNuveen	704765992271015936	2016-03-01T20:31:21	During the recent rally, cyclical areas of the market have outperformed. That suggests global growth is recovering 
BobDollNuveen	704716829348995072	2016-03-01T17:15:59	Markets have improved over the last few weeks. My thoughts about what has changed and what hasn’t: 
BobDollNuveen	704675385661853696	2016-03-01T14:31:18	Fears over a possible negative interest rate campaign in the U.S. have faded. That should help investor sentiment. 
BobDollNuveen	704433631121567745	2016-02-29T22:30:40	For now, stock prices are still following oil markets. That should change if and when oil prices stabilize. 
BobDollNuveen	704411030110248960	2016-02-29T21:00:51	At this week’s G20 meeting, we’re watching for signs that countries will avoid engaging in currency wars. 
BobDollNuveen	704388375646699520	2016-02-29T19:30:50	With last week’s advance, US equities are now up close to 8% since their Feb 11 low. Thoughts about what’s next: 
BobDollNuveen	704366060015894528	2016-02-29T18:02:09	Today’s commentary now available: “2016 May Be a Frustrating Year for Both Bulls and Bears.” 
BobDollNuveen	703345250291601409	2016-02-26T22:25:49	The tightening jobs market and rising consumer spending levels are slowly putting some upward pressure on inflation. 
BobDollNuveen	703324361017716736	2016-02-26T21:02:49	Even though the dollar has risen and oil prices have fallen, we are starting to see some signs of inflation. 
BobDollNuveen	703299865217011712	2016-02-26T19:25:29	Core CPI rose 0.3% last month, the largest increase since 2006. Here’s my take on why: 
BobDollNuveen	703286347595956224	2016-02-26T18:31:46	This looks to be a year that will frustrate both the bulls and bears as markets remain somewhat trendless.
BobDollNuveen	703264335339118593	2016-02-26T17:04:18	Investors loathe uncertainty in politics. And unfortunately, this looks to be an uncertain type of year. 
BobDollNuveen	703211782714880000	2016-02-26T13:35:28	I think higher levels of government spending will provide some fiscal stimulus for the U.S. economy. 
BobDollNuveen	703000363801178113	2016-02-25T23:35:22	Two key economic metrics to watch for: better global manufacturing and an increase in trade. 
BobDollNuveen	702969236537401345	2016-02-25T21:31:41	If we do see a sustained equity rally, I think the financials and technology sectors would lead the way.
BobDollNuveen	702939129789685760	2016-02-25T19:32:03	Among some of the more defensive sectors in the market, I still think telecommunications looks attractive.
BobDollNuveen	702886576033013760	2016-02-25T16:03:13	Improvements in the jobs market and consumer spending show that energy challenges aren’t slowing the economy. 
BobDollNuveen	702856373739122689	2016-02-25T14:03:12	What will it take to see risk assets such as equities experience a sustained uptrend? Here’s a list: 
BobDollNuveen	702841196197122048	2016-02-25T13:02:53	In some ways, it is surprising that the economy isn’t doing better given years of zero interest rates. Some reasons: 
BobDollNuveen	702629652993593344	2016-02-24T23:02:18	Unemployment claims fell again last week. That shows the labor market remains resistant to downside pressures. 
BobDollNuveen	702599568505106432	2016-02-24T21:02:45	Inflation is slowly starting to creep higher as a result of domestic cost pressures. Numbers and details: 
BobDollNuveen	702572655757676545	2016-02-24T19:15:48	U.S. consumers are in an enviable position—they are both spending more and increasing savings. That’s good economic news.
BobDollNuveen	702561552021512192	2016-02-24T18:31:41	The main thing stocks need for a sustained increase would be better earnings data. That should happen over the coming months.
BobDollNuveen	702509099058126848	2016-02-24T15:03:15	The unsettled nature of the U.S. presidential race could be a negative for financial markets. 
BobDollNuveen	702486992819523584	2016-02-24T13:35:25	My best guess for 2016 real GDP is around 2.5%. 
BobDollNuveen	702267300163035136	2016-02-23T23:02:26	The energy sector remains under pressure, but we haven’t seen much contagion into the broader economy. 
BobDollNuveen	702252175632814080	2016-02-23T22:02:20	I think near term outlook remains highly uncertain, but I am optimistic about equities for the coming months. 
BobDollNuveen	702214250031398912	2016-02-23T19:31:38	Investors are overly pessimistic about the economy. Jobs data and consumer spending are looking solid.
BobDollNuveen	702191938167042048	2016-02-23T18:02:58	Investors should become less bearish over the coming months, but it will take some time. 
BobDollNuveen	702153878905688065	2016-02-23T15:31:44	Markets have been stuck in a negative feedback loop for most of 2016. I don’t think we’re out of that trend yet. 
BobDollNuveen	702123608236302336	2016-02-23T13:31:27	The recent increase in equity prices came without a corresponding rise in government bond yields. What that means: 
BobDollNuveen	701912021395226624	2016-02-22T23:30:41	Last week’s rally was largely a result of an oversold bounce, but we also saw some small fundamental improvements. 
BobDollNuveen	701874362689916929	2016-02-22T21:01:02	Equity prices spiked around the world last week. What will it take for that trend to continue? My thoughts here: 
BobDollNuveen	701851591754850305	2016-02-22T19:30:33	Non-U.S. stocks led the rally last week, but markets in the U.S. remain ahead for the year. Numbers: 
BobDollNuveen	701834758997876736	2016-02-22T18:23:40	The link between oil and equities is unusual. I think it’s due more to psychological factors, not fundamental reality.
BobDollNuveen	701820019177558018	2016-02-22T17:25:06	Today’s commentary now available: “Signs of Hope Emerge, but Pessimism Remains High.” 
BobDollNuveen	700817802903609344	2016-02-19T23:02:39	If we do enter into recession, I think the S&amp;P could drop to around 1,600. If not, it could rise back to 2,000. 
BobDollNuveen	700757583813017601	2016-02-19T19:03:22	Zero or negative rate policies may provide some short-term relief but could trigger financial distortions. 
BobDollNuveen	700719483065913345	2016-02-19T16:31:58	Retail sales levels in Jan were stronger than expected. That points to underlying strength in the consumer sector 
BobDollNuveen	700689222114680832	2016-02-19T14:31:43	I think it will take time for market confusion &amp; turmoil to unwind. Things could be sloppy for weeks or months: 
BobDollNuveen	700417394024566784	2016-02-18T20:31:34	Despite lower energy prices, consumers are saving rather than spending their “energy dividends.” Details here: 
BobDollNuveen	700387236370583552	2016-02-18T18:31:44	I think equity markets are in an extended bottoming process. What to expect from here: 
BobDollNuveen	700319689319251968	2016-02-18T14:03:19	The Fed is in a tough spot, having to balance economic fundamentals with mounting investor fears. Read more: 
BobDollNuveen	700304438356008960	2016-02-18T13:02:43	Ongoing financial turmoil may slow jobs growth, but any setback should be modest. More details here: 
BobDollNuveen	700092895630643202	2016-02-17T23:02:08	Stocks look to be pricing in a 50/50 chance of a US recession, but I don’t think one is likely. Further insight: 
BobDollNuveen	700062778313326592	2016-02-17T21:02:27	Ultimately, I think we’ll need to see improvements in economic data in order for sentiment to improve. Details: 
BobDollNuveen	700002545964617729	2016-02-17T17:03:07	Given the uncertainty, it is understandable for investors who can’t tolerate the swings to become more defensive: 
BobDollNuveen	699964371397644290	2016-02-17T14:31:25	For years, it seemed like the business sector was strong while consumers were weak. That may be changing. Insight: 
BobDollNuveen	699941900288135168	2016-02-17T13:02:07	We may see more volatility and downside, but I think stock prices are in the process of bottoming. Reasons why: 
BobDollNuveen	699730257214119945	2016-02-16T23:01:08	Investor focus remains firmly on downside risks. How long will that continue, and what could change that? Insight 
BobDollNuveen	699692389326266368	2016-02-16T20:30:39	Initial unemployment claims fell, suggesting the jobs market remains relatively resilient. More detail here: 
BobDollNuveen	699669759206559745	2016-02-16T19:00:44	US stocks retreated to mid-Jan lows last week before recovering. That could be a sign of possible stabilization 
BobDollNuveen	699642471693840384	2016-02-16T17:12:18	Today’s commentary now available: “A Recession Remains Unlikely Despite Market Turmoil.” 
BobDollNuveen	698258244784021504	2016-02-12T21:31:53	Looks like 4Q earnings per share will fall again. Weakness continues to be focused in the energy sector. Insight: 
BobDollNuveen	698175647953321989	2016-02-12T16:03:40	Investor sentiment is unlikely to improve until we see stronger economic data &amp; some stabilization in oil. 
BobDollNuveen	698130216108040192	2016-02-12T13:03:08	I think the long-term decline in oil prices is more about oversupply than falling demand. Insight here: 
BobDollNuveen	697895815399006208	2016-02-11T21:31:43	Investors are focusing on the negatives &amp; seem to be forecasting a pretty high chance of a recession. I disagree. 
BobDollNuveen	697835557188141056	2016-02-11T17:32:16	The Fed appears to still be on track to slowly normalize interest rates this yr. I expect slow, gradual increases. 
BobDollNuveen	697798131518435329	2016-02-11T15:03:33	Volatility &amp; downward price pressure may persist, but I think stocks should outperform bonds over the coming year. 
BobDollNuveen	697548552302694400	2016-02-10T22:31:49	One bullish signal for stocks: Corporate buyback plans are at a record level. Further details here: 
BobDollNuveen	697511241661620224	2016-02-10T20:03:33	I do not believe conditions are in place for a recession in either the U.S. or global economies: Reasons why: 
BobDollNuveen	697466055766249472	2016-02-10T17:04:00	I think there is a disconnect between investor’s actions and economic fundamentals. More detail here: 
BobDollNuveen	697420544766033920	2016-02-10T14:03:09	The energy sector continues to weigh on overall corporate earnings. Outside of energy, results have been OK. 
BobDollNuveen	697178673888292866	2016-02-09T22:02:03	One of the key numbers from last week: The Jan employment report showed wages are rising. More details here: 
BobDollNuveen	697118387403628548	2016-02-09T18:02:30	My best estimate for the timing of the next Fed rate hike is June. Further insight here: 
BobDollNuveen	697057903631601664	2016-02-09T14:02:09	The possibility of coordinated oil production cuts appears to be growing. This may help stabilize prices. Details: 
BobDollNuveen	697042684398145540	2016-02-09T13:01:41	Investors have been focused on the “de-risking” theme for most of 2016. How much longer will that go on? My view: 
BobDollNuveen	696830953453457408	2016-02-08T23:00:20	$85 billion. That’s the amount of announced buybacks so far this year. The strongest start to a year in history. 
BobDollNuveen	696822753211633664	2016-02-08T22:27:45	Today’s commentary now available: “Equities Remain Under Pressure as Investors Focus on the Negatives.” 
BobDollNuveen	695737514036953088	2016-02-05T22:35:24	Fed statements indicate rate hikes will be slow and measured. That’s a positive for risk assets. 
BobDollNuveen	695728714659844096	2016-02-05T22:00:26	The mixed January jobs report makes it unlikely the Fed raises rates in March. June is more likely.
BobDollNuveen	695717397165174788	2016-02-05T21:15:27	Headline Jan jobs numbers were disappointing, but some internals such as avg hourly earnings show the economy is still accelerating
BobDollNuveen	695646976831004680	2016-02-05T16:35:38	Since 2014 when oil prices started falling, lower prices have hurt more than helped. I expect that will change. 
BobDollNuveen	695608776146231296	2016-02-05T14:03:50	Barring a sharp upward acceleration in economic growth, I don’t think the Fed will raise rates before June. 
BobDollNuveen	695360055642689539	2016-02-04T21:35:31	Given recent market action, I think investors basically have three options. Details in this week’s commentary: 
BobDollNuveen	695314787815784448	2016-02-04T18:35:38	One good sign in the recent data: The Consumer Confidence Index ticked higher in January: 
BobDollNuveen	695291740840935428	2016-02-04T17:04:03	A key economic indicator to watch: Improvements in global manufacturing. 
BobDollNuveen	695231062549618688	2016-02-04T13:02:56	Outside of the energy sector, corporate earnings results aren’t all that bad. Some numbers: 
BobDollNuveen	694989460354809860	2016-02-03T21:02:54	The so-called “oil dividend” has yet to materialize, but there are reasons to think that it still will: 
BobDollNuveen	694921298884034560	2016-02-03T16:32:03	Investment view: A pro-growth stance makes sense, but requires patience. 
BobDollNuveen	694891019872161793	2016-02-03T14:31:44	Consumer spending slowed in the last part of 2015, but I think that trend should change over time. 
BobDollNuveen	694664415686365184	2016-02-02T23:31:17	Corporate earnings are still struggling with the same issues they have faced for some time (oil &amp; the dollar). 
BobDollNuveen	694574111813689345	2016-02-02T17:32:27	The Fed’s recent tone has turned a bit more dovish as the central bank is focusing on global issues. 
BobDollNuveen	694528586972274688	2016-02-02T14:31:33	Turbulence is likely to persist, but I expect stock prices and bond yields to rise in 2016. 
BobDollNuveen	694513477151494144	2016-02-02T13:31:31	It appears to me that financial markets are overly discounting economic negatives: 
BobDollNuveen	694316970137784320	2016-02-02T00:30:40	4Q GDP growth was pretty weak, but 2015 as a whole showed what I would call “respectable” growth. 
BobDollNuveen	694256553537486850	2016-02-01T20:30:35	As last week’s news from Japan illustrates, global monetary policy appears to remain a tailwind for risk assets. 
BobDollNuveen	694218809813680130	2016-02-01T18:00:36	For now, equities are following the lead from oil prices, but that should cease once oil finally stabilizes. 
BobDollNuveen	694207530764013568	2016-02-01T17:15:47	Today’s commentary now available: “Equities Rally as Oil and Monetary Policy Remain in Focus.” 
BobDollNuveen	693237704868413442	2016-01-30T01:02:03	My annual market outlook has a list of 2015 highlights and lowlights and 2016 opportunities and risks. 
BobDollNuveen	693192596278112257	2016-01-29T22:02:48	Oil price volatility isn’t ending any time soon, but I think the commodity may be in a bottoming process. 
BobDollNuveen	693147344263614464	2016-01-29T19:02:59	We are seeing high profits, rising cash holdings, good debt servicing &amp; solid net worth from the corporate sector 
BobDollNuveen	693117368197844996	2016-01-29T17:03:52	A major variable for the coming year is whether global growth struggles or accelerates. My bet is on the latter. 
BobDollNuveen	693094215329435648	2016-01-29T15:31:52	I think corporate earnings should recover in 2016, but improvements may be limited. 
BobDollNuveen	693056688404971520	2016-01-29T13:02:45	Every year, I pick a list of sectors that should outperform. Last year’s list was a home run. Here’s this year’s: 
BobDollNuveen	692863621446049792	2016-01-29T00:15:34	Economic growth was decent in 2015, but not as strong as I expected. Full predictions scorecard here: 
BobDollNuveen	692815066920554496	2016-01-28T21:02:38	In my opinion, the economy is doing better than equity markets. There’s a disconnect in the numbers. 
BobDollNuveen	692800134271344641	2016-01-28T20:03:18	Corp earnings were the chief headwind for equity prices last year. And they remain the key variable for 2016. 
BobDollNuveen	692754952511471621	2016-01-28T17:03:46	Some interesting numbers around S&amp;P 500 yield that suggest stocks may rise over the coming months: 
BobDollNuveen	692709470783283200	2016-01-28T14:03:02	Consumer spending should continue to improve as a result of higher wages and lower energy prices. 
BobDollNuveen	692501231017791488	2016-01-28T00:15:34	A large upside or downside move in stocks this year seems unlikely to me. 
BobDollNuveen	692482807340371968	2016-01-27T23:02:21	It may take some time, but confidence should improve over the coming months. 
BobDollNuveen	692463511407071232	2016-01-27T21:45:41	Investors appear to be ignoring economic fundamentals. Conditions appear healthier than markets are forecasting. 
BobDollNuveen	692440930524254209	2016-01-27T20:15:57	I think equity market leadership is shifting toward companies that can benefit from stronger economic growth: 
BobDollNuveen	692362191840886784	2016-01-27T15:03:04	Despite rising anxiety about the corporate sector, it appears pretty healthy to us. 
BobDollNuveen	692331832814112768	2016-01-27T13:02:26	Some are forecasting a U.S. recession. I just don’t see that happening. Here’s some reasons why: 
BobDollNuveen	692150460740980737	2016-01-27T01:01:44	2015 will likely be remembered as difficult but not disastrous for investors. Some things may not change in 2016. 
BobDollNuveen	692112559395176448	2016-01-26T22:31:07	The wild swings in the markets are not keeping with economic fundamentals. Some numbers to look at: 
BobDollNuveen	692090165708333056	2016-01-26T21:02:08	Government spending should pick up in 2016. That should help promote economic growth. 
BobDollNuveen	692060071216451586	2016-01-26T19:02:33	The key risks to the economy appear to be issues in China and a slowdown in global manufacturing: 
BobDollNuveen	692007953780576256	2016-01-26T15:35:27	An early look at Jan manufacturing shows an uptick. If it holds, that would be really good news for the economy. 
BobDollNuveen	691976687924416514	2016-01-26T13:31:13	I’m not expecting any material changes at this week’s Fed meeting, but the bank may shift tone a bit. 
BobDollNuveen	691787802791514112	2016-01-26T01:00:39	Market returns in 2016 are likely to be choppy and gains may be limited. So what to do? Here’s some ideas. 
BobDollNuveen	691765111640477696	2016-01-25T23:30:29	It is early in reporting season, but 4Q earnings results suggest a decent economic backdrop for 2016. 
BobDollNuveen	691734895987654657	2016-01-25T21:30:25	Suggestions from the ECB and BOJ that they may ease further I think are a positive for risk assets. 
BobDollNuveen	691719812716826624	2016-01-25T20:30:29	Last wk’s gains don’t appear to be attributable to any real fundamental shifts. I think volatility will persist. 
BobDollNuveen	691700307676520448	2016-01-25T19:12:59	This week’s commentary now available: “Markets Recover (for Now) as Investors Remain Wary.” 
BobDollNuveen	690685828671086592	2016-01-23T00:01:48	Final scorecard for my 2015 predictions: seven out of ten. What did I get right and wrong? Answers here. 
BobDollNuveen	690663049573851136	2016-01-22T22:31:17	I believe investors should stay with a moderately pro-growth investment stance despite the near-term risks: 
BobDollNuveen	690595597896802306	2016-01-22T18:03:15	Detailed recap of 2015 and a look ahead to what the New Year might bring: 
BobDollNuveen	690587715503521793	2016-01-22T17:31:56	Over time, lower energy prices should help consumers and businesses and are a plus for U.S. trade. 
BobDollNuveen	690565556303433729	2016-01-22T16:03:53	2015 Ten Predictions Scorecard: Fortunately more right than wrong. Here’s the details: 
BobDollNuveen	690527234675859456	2016-01-22T13:31:36	It will take some time, but I expect investor sentiment will recover over the coming months. 
BobDollNuveen	690285628555161600	2016-01-21T21:31:33	Looks to me like equity markets are forecasting a 50% chance of recession. I think the odds are closer to 25%. 
BobDollNuveen	690263489768726528	2016-01-21T20:03:35	The last time US stocks experienced 2 yrs in a row of single-digit returns was 1977/1978. It could happen again: 
BobDollNuveen	690248216718282753	2016-01-21T19:02:53	My advice to investors during market volatility: Be patient and don’t shift your long-term strategy. 
BobDollNuveen	690233138564448256	2016-01-21T18:02:58	In case you missed it: U.S. stocks just experienced seven consecutive years of gains for the first time ever. 
BobDollNuveen	690202902309289985	2016-01-21T16:02:49	One positive for the global economy: Central bank policy around the world remains accommodative. 
BobDollNuveen	690172751651430400	2016-01-21T14:03:01	Falling oil prices should be a positive for the U.S. economy, but we’ll have to endure some short-term pain. 
BobDollNuveen	689960971742416897	2016-01-21T00:01:29	Decent economic growth and low default rates should allow high yield spreads to narrow this year. 
BobDollNuveen	689930843507286016	2016-01-20T22:01:46	Investor sentiment has been turning sharply negative lately, but there are some positives investors should consider: 
BobDollNuveen	689915801198026752	2016-01-20T21:01:59	Outside of equity markets, most financial assets are not showing severe stress or dislocations. 
BobDollNuveen	689870881661796357	2016-01-20T18:03:30	I expect real GDP to be less than 3% and nominal GDP to be under 5% for an unprecedented tenth year in a row. 
BobDollNuveen	689825306866249729	2016-01-20T15:02:24	4Q earnings are likely to be negative. That would mean we’ll see three consecutive quarters of profit declines. 
BobDollNuveen	689794999806988288	2016-01-20T13:01:58	The current environment reminds me a bit of 2010-2012 when we saw sharp market sell-offs and subsequent rallies. 
BobDollNuveen	689583338324135936	2016-01-19T23:00:54	In some ways, markets are being driven more by sentiment shifts than fundamental changes. 
BobDollNuveen	689545481060507657	2016-01-19T20:30:28	Falling oil prices are more due to supply excesses than weakening global growth. 
BobDollNuveen	689512681972301824	2016-01-19T18:20:08	This week’s commentary now available: “The Sharp Equity Sell-Off Continues as Sentiment Sours.” 
BobDollNuveen	689478304982663171	2016-01-19T16:03:32	One key investment theme for 2016: Selectivity is critical. Here’s a list of other ones: 
BobDollNuveen	689463212014592001	2016-01-19T15:03:34	U.S. equities have generally long outperformed international stocks. That may start to change in 2016. 
BobDollNuveen	688134004927631360	2016-01-15T23:01:46	It’s a long shot, but I think Republicans can capture the White House this year: 
BobDollNuveen	688089086138167296	2016-01-15T20:03:16	Cheaper Chinese goods and a weaker Chinese currency could actually help stimulate U.S. growth: 
BobDollNuveen	688065714016620545	2016-01-15T18:30:24	If oil prices don’t recover, I think we’ll see credit issues getting worse.
BobDollNuveen	688055120689545216	2016-01-15T17:48:18	I’m not expecting to see the current sell-off lead to a bear market, but I think we need oil to stabilize for equities to stop falling.
BobDollNuveen	688028713024360453	2016-01-15T16:03:22	Positives for stocks: moderate economic growth, low inflation, low interest rates and rising consumer spending. 
BobDollNuveen	687983224979636224	2016-01-15T13:02:37	Strength in the labor market helps validate the Fed’s December decision to raise interest rates. 
BobDollNuveen	687722372124782596	2016-01-14T19:46:05	We will soon start to see 4Q earnings results. I expect the numbers will be soft: 
BobDollNuveen	687661875140673537	2016-01-14T15:45:41	Notwithstanding the recent downturn, I believe stocks will outperform bonds in 2016: 
BobDollNuveen	687628124067094528	2016-01-14T13:31:34	U.S. exports to China account for less than 0.66% of GDP. So economic contagion should be limited. 
BobDollNuveen	687620852217688068	2016-01-14T13:02:41	After China, the next big issue that should drive markets will be 4Q earnings. Here’s a preview: 
BobDollNuveen	687416617052057600	2016-01-13T23:31:07	When 4Q economic data come out, I think it will show that the automotive sector is weakening. 
BobDollNuveen	687379222902521856	2016-01-13T21:02:32	It may take some time, but I expect investor confidence to improve over the coming months. 
BobDollNuveen	687311064678150144	2016-01-13T16:31:42	My guess is that fourth quarter U.S. economic growth may have weakened a bit. 
BobDollNuveen	687265685769162752	2016-01-13T13:31:22	China remains the near-term focus for investors, but there are other issues and risks on the horizon: 
BobDollNuveen	687061872827351040	2016-01-13T00:01:30	The renewed slide in oil prices is likely to put additional pressure on corporate earnings. 
BobDollNuveen	686996204652204032	2016-01-12T19:40:33	China faces some real fundamental issues, but I think the current crisis has largely been self-inflicted: 
BobDollNuveen	686948602950893569	2016-01-12T16:31:24	Despite all of the recent drama, I believe the global economy will improve over the next twelve months. 
BobDollNuveen	686941304920608768	2016-01-12T16:02:24	Expect volatility, but I would encourage investors to overweight equities in their portfolios: 
BobDollNuveen	686895917652406273	2016-01-12T13:02:03	Although investors are heavily focused on China right now, I think US economy is well insulated from issues: 
BobDollNuveen	686684241728565248	2016-01-11T23:00:55	Despite the sharp market pullback over the past several weeks, investors appear calm. 
BobDollNuveen	686669074689093632	2016-01-11T22:00:39	Last week was the worst first trading week of the year for U.S. equities in history. My thoughts on what happened: 
BobDollNuveen	686633896910393344	2016-01-11T19:40:52	This week’s commentary now available: “China Worries Trigger a Tough Start to the New Year.” 
BobDollNuveen	686633847526658048	2016-01-11T19:40:40	Interesting 2015 fact: For the first time since 2006, the U.S. contributed more to global GDP than China: 
BobDollNuveen	686608624911839232	2016-01-11T18:00:27	I think small cap stocks are likely to lag large caps this year (less liquidity and more volatile).
BobDollNuveen	686564069608964096	2016-01-11T15:03:24	Over the coming year, I think the Fed will move slowly and gradually. They don’t want to jeopardize all of the work they did.
BobDollNuveen	686548889244139520	2016-01-11T14:03:05	2016 U.S. inflation outlook: I’m expecting it to rise from very low to low, led by gains in wage rates.
BobDollNuveen	686533648435273732	2016-01-11T13:02:31	Equities may struggle, but should be able to outperform bonds again in 2016. Details: 
BobDollNuveen	685582141082742785	2016-01-08T22:01:34	The collapsing federal budget deficit was one of the unsung heroes over the last few years. I think that trend is coming to an end.
BobDollNuveen	685559195106697216	2016-01-08T20:30:23	Despite a downtick in December average hourly earnings, I think we’ll see upward pressure on wages in 2016.
BobDollNuveen	685542765317472256	2016-01-08T19:25:06	December jobs numbers cap off a strong year and point to modestly accelerating U.S. economic growth.
BobDollNuveen	685506935886639105	2016-01-08T17:02:44	I expected stocks to have a “good” yr in 2015. Total returns were positive, but probably not quite strong enough. 
BobDollNuveen	685495083853066240	2016-01-08T16:15:38	Terrorism is one threat I think investors needs to consider in the coming year. And, sadly, terrorism is in a bull market.
BobDollNuveen	685446301853609984	2016-01-08T13:01:47	I think 2016 will be a challenging year for investors. But there are some tactical opportunities. Details: 
BobDollNuveen	685257187778772992	2016-01-08T00:30:19	If China continues to struggle as much as it is now, I expect the Fed will be slower to raise rates this year.
BobDollNuveen	685235745603371014	2016-01-07T23:05:07	I think the removal of circuit breakers in China’s market is a good thing. Markets need liquidity to function normally.
BobDollNuveen	685223164176166912	2016-01-07T22:15:07	This hasn’t been a fun week for the markets, but we saw similar action last August. And I expect we’ll get through this as well.
BobDollNuveen	685219531808190466	2016-01-07T22:00:41	The U.S. political backdrop has been bizarre, to put it mildly. That’s not likely to change in 2016. 
BobDollNuveen	685204404736290817	2016-01-07T21:00:35	In 2015, equities, bonds and cash all (barely) had positive performance. Here’s a look at the numbers. 
BobDollNuveen	685182897565908992	2016-01-07T19:35:07	Now available: 2016 Ten Predictions: “Investors See Glimmers of Hope Along a Rocky Path.” 
BobDollNuveen	685174559197257728	2016-01-07T19:01:59	High yield spreads rose last year, but I think they have a good chance of falling in 2016.
BobDollNuveen	685129300782264320	2016-01-07T16:02:09	The U.S. political backdrop has been bizarre, to put it mildly. That’s not likely to change in 2016.
BobDollNuveen	685083904664014848	2016-01-07T13:01:45	One key to determining equity returns this year will probably be the direction of corporate earnings.
BobDollNuveen	684882198047109120	2016-01-06T23:40:15	It looks like it may be a tough environment for investors this year. I think security selection will be critical.
BobDollNuveen	684841977788108800	2016-01-06T21:00:25	Market volatility has picked up so far this year. I expect the ride will continue to be choppy for investors.
BobDollNuveen	684782418285453312	2016-01-06T17:03:45	Last year was marked by disappointments, but there were a number of positive factors as well. 
BobDollNuveen	684752164879740928	2016-01-06T15:03:32	I'm somewhat surprised cheaper oil/rising dollar dynamic has failed to help non-resource-related earnings results. 
BobDollNuveen	684480184066662400	2016-01-05T21:02:47	I expect global economic growth will improve modestly over the next 12 months. 
BobDollNuveen	684434954743341056	2016-01-05T18:03:04	A key theme for investors in 2016: Selectivity will be critical for investors’ success. 
BobDollNuveen	684359359787319296	2016-01-05T13:02:40	2015's main equity headwind was a lackluster earnings environment. There are reasons to believe 2016 may be brighter 
BobDollNuveen	684102823915683840	2016-01-04T20:03:17	Equity markets may struggle in 2016, but I still expect they will outperform bonds. 
BobDollNuveen	684072502650384385	2016-01-04T18:02:48	2015 was certainly a year of uncertainty. Here’s some thoughts about what the New Year might bring. 
BobDollNuveen	684012168178696192	2016-01-04T14:03:03	Last year was dominated by a series of crises, but equity markets weathered them pretty well. 
BobDollNuveen	683015191546716160	2016-01-01T20:01:26	Will 2016 resemble 2015? Or will investors witness some changes? Here’s my take: 
BobDollNuveen	682984958873452544	2016-01-01T18:01:18	Looking back on 2015, I would say it was a difficult but not disastrous year for investors. 
BobDollNuveen	682697955393048576	2015-12-31T23:00:51	One key to next year’s outlook will be the direction of corporate earnings. 
BobDollNuveen	682682812533714944	2015-12-31T22:00:40	This week’s commentary now available: “2016: Investors See Glimmers of Hope Along a Rocky Path.” 
BobDollNuveen	682547418907410432	2015-12-31T13:02:40	I thought Chinese growth would slow in 2015, but I was surprised by the pace at which it did. 
BobDollNuveen	682369468090200065	2015-12-31T01:15:33	We saw a so-called “bear flattener” this year as short-term rates rose more than long-term rates. 
BobDollNuveen	682335925876097024	2015-12-30T23:02:16	Over the coming year, oil prices should stabilize, but are likely to remain range-bound. 
BobDollNuveen	682294074313932801	2015-12-30T20:15:58	I expected tech, health care and telecoms would win in 2015. That definitely happened: 
BobDollNuveen	682248772169154564	2015-12-30T17:15:57	Our complete 10 Predictions for 2016 will be available in early Jan. Here’s a sneak peek at some ideas: 
BobDollNuveen	682215398712934401	2015-12-30T15:03:20	Over time, companies that have generated free cash flow have outperformed on a relative basis. Details here: 
BobDollNuveen	682003658939076608	2015-12-30T01:01:57	One of my favorite investing themes: unit growth over pricing power. Details and examples here:
