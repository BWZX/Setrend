jswatz	714653976952590336	2016-03-29T03:22:40	I agree, to an extent, w/ POTUS, but I believe future historians will definitely use social media for research, etc.

jswatz	714653163605766144	2016-03-29T03:19:26	rachelzarrell jswatz I still feel like this tweet of mine from 2012 should have gotten more attention 
jswatz	714653352383131648	2016-03-29T03:20:11	KateAurthur rachelzarrell that is ART.
jswatz	714652669021929473	2016-03-29T03:17:28	This is inspirational but I wonder if it's not more nostalgic than true 
jswatz	714652249566404608	2016-03-29T03:15:48	They will look and, sadly, find far too little. RT jswatz: Obama said this tonight about journalism. 
jswatz	714651914479083521	2016-03-29T03:14:28	jswatz rachelzarrell I credit him with being much less out of touch than most other people in his position.
jswatz	714652652093710336	2016-03-29T03:17:24	that's why he said it. 
jswatz	714652457553543168	2016-03-29T03:16:38	rachelzarrell "Ah. The giants." 
jswatz	714651614410383361	2016-03-29T03:13:17	if you think we (I) won't still be talking about this tweet in 40 years you are wrong jswatz 
jswatz	714651289724985346	2016-03-29T03:11:59	jswatz How much great journalism of the sort Obama cites relies on whistleblowers? And how has Obama treated whistleblowers?
jswatz	714651668412018692	2016-03-29T03:13:29	KateAurthur rachelzarrell yes, but he's not mistaking the reaction for the substance.
jswatz	714651164537565184	2016-03-29T03:11:29	jswatz rachelzarrell Obama of course wouldn't know that great journalism actually does get a lot of RTs!
jswatz	714650957146152962	2016-03-29T03:10:40	Think I'll give this a RT... 
jswatz	714650883821322240	2016-03-29T03:10:22	I love this. And it couldn't be any truer for a society today that lives in what is happening at that exact moment.  
jswatz	714650716091129856	2016-03-29T03:09:42	Obama has clearly learned nothing from his tenure as Pres if he thinks that's the case 
jswatz	714650662487896064	2016-03-29T03:09:30	jswatz I don't think he's wrong. But the great tweets will live 4ever
jswatz	714651071315107840	2016-03-29T03:11:07	rachelzarrell like yours!
jswatz	714650477598752769	2016-03-29T03:08:46	This is going to be your most re-tweeted tweet but no one's going to remember it in 30 years, so there. 
jswatz	714650867706818561	2016-03-29T03:10:19	jadmouawad I can live with that. I'm just enjoying the meta moment.
jswatz	714650458330152961	2016-03-29T03:08:41	I would think so?  
jswatz	714650178922217472	2016-03-29T03:07:34	Oh how I wish BarackObama would decide to run a news outlet when he leaves office. AMEN to this!!! Journalism 
jswatz	714650269867442176	2016-03-29T03:07:56	jswatz wishful thinking

jswatz	714646742579462144	2016-03-29T02:53:55	Ironic coming from a president who has prosecuted more whistleblowers than all past presidents combined?

jswatz	714644962860789761	2016-03-29T02:46:51	This is inspiring. But how many of you are reading old pieces of investigative journalism from 1966 tonight? 
jswatz	714644635801542656	2016-03-29T02:45:33	There's a bit of irony in retweeting this, but it's spot-on.

jswatz	714642662914019328	2016-03-29T02:37:42	Agree completely. We'll still have the big national outlets but I worry we'll have no watchdogs at the local level
