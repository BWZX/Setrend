CGasparino	714879522538008576	2016-03-29T18:18:54	i dont know--ask your daughter wife or sister how they wld feel if something like this happened to them 
CGasparino	714878873742090240	2016-03-29T18:16:19	in MichelleFields words: "I almost fell to the ground but was able to maintain my balance Nonetheless I was shaken" 
CGasparino	714877966480584704	2016-03-29T18:12:43	no youre just a wimp who condones brutish behavior behind a fake name and no photo real standup guy 
CGasparino	714877753376395265	2016-03-29T18:11:52	hey if you spend hours at a Nambla meeting TrumpsBrain you can deal w my beautiful white teeth tmwrd321
CGasparino	714877409141481472	2016-03-29T18:10:30	never gonna happen he's probably a 54 year old fat dude who lives w his mom and collect barbie dolls 
CGasparino	714877238462689280	2016-03-29T18:09:50	why would donald or anyone on his team go out w statements like this? its so bizarre and it cld hurt corey's case 
CGasparino	714876872392253440	2016-03-29T18:08:22	pretty disgusting stuff goes down on twitter

CGasparino	714875368155418625	2016-03-29T18:02:24	you mean you'll have to practice punching a guy who can punch back instead of woman 
CGasparino	714875161061687296	2016-03-29T18:01:34	ok sorry TrumpsBrain youre just a run-of-the-mill perv and Nambla board member
CGasparino	714874947772874752	2016-03-29T18:00:43	wld u be saying that if it were you, or your daughter? MadAsDell9 MichelleFields
CGasparino	714874143791927296	2016-03-29T17:57:32	every time i see MichelleFields w a tape recorder near a candidate i say to myself "that scary woman must be stopped at all costs!"

CGasparino	714872560358281216	2016-03-29T17:51:14	if he needed protecting why didnt the secret service step in? 
CGasparino	714872454884106240	2016-03-29T17:50:49	more weird rationalizations 
CGasparino	714872189938323460	2016-03-29T17:49:46	yeah guys who abuse women will be flocking to his campaign 
CGasparino	714868155630268417	2016-03-29T17:33:44	another complication for CLewandowski_: what he tells (has told) police about MichelleFields  incident--remember he said it NEVER happened
CGasparino	714867691643736064	2016-03-29T17:31:53	that video is pretty conclusive and lets hope he doesnt lie to the police 
CGasparino	714867279050121216	2016-03-29T17:30:15	we know your scared of men condone beating up women  
CGasparino	714866997893304321	2016-03-29T17:29:08	three times a week usually in the morn 
CGasparino	714866884429021184	2016-03-29T17:28:41	you can be pushed out of the way in a forceful manner if the SecretService deems you as a "threat"  
CGasparino	714866656124645377	2016-03-29T17:27:47	again the question: why didnt the SecretService step in if what she was doing was so offensive? 
CGasparino	714866321469476864	2016-03-29T17:26:27	TheBigOldDog forgive me for asking for a clear explanation BUT ppl get charged for that stuff on subways as well
CGasparino	714866123821285378	2016-03-29T17:25:40	here's an interesting question: if what MichelleFields did to realDonaldTrump was so offensive why DIDNT the SecretService step in?
CGasparino	714865792005726209	2016-03-29T17:24:21	high energy=battery?

CGasparino	714865224935813122	2016-03-29T17:22:05	i hate to sound like donald, but can someone tell this guy to communicate in English 
CGasparino	714864945108660224	2016-03-29T17:20:59	thats kinda what reporters do: put mics in candidate's faces and more often than not they dont get thrown around 
CGasparino	714864730528034816	2016-03-29T17:20:07	says the guy w the fake name no picture who condones beating up women  
CGasparino	714863804622905344	2016-03-29T17:16:27	grab me on the arm see what happens (to do that you'd have to buy a bus ticket from your trailer park to nyc) 
CGasparino	714863448358649857	2016-03-29T17:15:02	among the more bizarre trumpkin defenses so far 
CGasparino	714863324706385920	2016-03-29T17:14:32	thats the point; shldnt be doing that to a female reporter its just rude and why did he pick her out of the crowd? 
CGasparino	714863056631664640	2016-03-29T17:13:28	bottom line is this: covering a candidate should not be a CONTACT sport and its one thing to do that to me and another to pick on a woman
CGasparino	714862723868135424	2016-03-29T17:12:09	would you treat your wife or daughter like that? oh, wait dont answer that

CGasparino	714858028630089728	2016-03-29T16:53:30	advice for this guy: if you dont wanna get charged w battery (or knocked out) dont randomly grab woman &amp; leave marks 
CGasparino	714857255905046529	2016-03-29T16:50:25	she has NO HISTORY of making stuff up jacobmathews MichelleFields
CGasparino	714857032889729025	2016-03-29T16:49:32	this is what i mean... 
CGasparino	714856935237881856	2016-03-29T16:49:09	like i said instead of attacking her he just shld have apologized  
CGasparino	714856459876499457	2016-03-29T16:47:16	how do you know he has had "affairs"? was there a tape like in this CLewandowski_ case?
