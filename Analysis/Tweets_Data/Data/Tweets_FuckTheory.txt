FuckTheory	726139363126591488	2016-04-29T20:01:29	But each ideology is equally ideological insofar as in each case self-reflexivity requires similar resources to produce genuine insight.

FuckTheory	725823434232619008	2016-04-28T23:06:06	This is the sense in which Freud's work is "philosophical," as D&amp;G define it in What Is Philosophy?
FuckTheory	725822009075224577	2016-04-28T23:00:26	He almost always begins by laying out the scope and nature of the problem, and briefly outlining existing concepts that address it.
FuckTheory	725821421520347138	2016-04-28T22:58:06	One of my favorite things about Freud is the way he feels the need, even after becoming world famous, to justify the writing of his texts.
FuckTheory	725808446801625088	2016-04-28T22:06:33	It's not just a question of wordplay. Rather, it's part of how Freud builds a conceptual plane of immanence.
FuckTheory	725808262566785024	2016-04-28T22:05:49	But it also means "efficiently mysterious" or "succinctly mysterious": i.e., *brief enough to address in a single essay.*
FuckTheory	725807952683253761	2016-04-28T22:04:35	The German phrase means, primarily, "mysterious from the perspective of the libidinal economy," yes.
FuckTheory	725806836872523776	2016-04-28T22:00:09	In this case there's a double sense to the German "ökonomisch rätselhaft" that Strachey simply irons out with his "economic point of view."
FuckTheory	725804425156136960	2016-04-28T21:50:34	A perfect example is the syntax of the opening sentence. Now, Freud's opening sentences are as crucial as they are amazing.
FuckTheory	725804144410431488	2016-04-28T21:49:27	The two biggest problems with Strachey's Standard Edition: he "clarifies" Freud's ambiguities and formalizes Freud's very distinctive idiom.

FuckTheory	725719194852020226	2016-04-28T16:11:53	Consider the opening paragraph of "The Economic Problem of Masochism" from 1924 (SAIII p. 343; GW XIII p. 371):

FuckTheory	725692239582744577	2016-04-28T14:24:47	But by and large, and in its best exemplars, the Freudian text is defined by two things: the concept and the plane of conceptual immanence.
FuckTheory	725691636966133760	2016-04-28T14:22:23	There are exceptions, of course, especially early or late in his career. The man's output was as diverse as it was prodigious and brilliant.
FuckTheory	725691268454617088	2016-04-28T14:20:55	Freud was an incredibly agile thinker whose work was, despite being informed by facts and by systems, nonetheless rooted in *concepts.*
FuckTheory	725690358324187136	2016-04-28T14:17:18	But even if we dismiss or bracket the conceptual-theoretical *doxa* of psychoanalysis, I think Freud's *method* aspires to pure immanence.
FuckTheory	725690100449947648	2016-04-28T14:16:17	I actually spent much of my dissertation working out a synthesis of Freud, Spinoza, and Hume to produce an ethics of sexuality.
FuckTheory	725689891611394050	2016-04-28T14:15:27	I happen to believe that Freud is much more theoretically compatible with my other guys (Spinoza, Hume, Bergson) than people think.
FuckTheory	725689437615722496	2016-04-28T14:13:39	But I digress.   My point is this: contrary to his reputation, Freud was actually an incredibly flexible, dynamic, self-reflexive thinker.
FuckTheory	725688813276778497	2016-04-28T14:11:10	That's how we ended up with the abomination of American psychiatric pseudo-analysis and the dry, frigid edifice of the Standard Edition.
FuckTheory	725688557424263169	2016-04-28T14:10:09	The British and American members of the Committee pushed very hard for professionalization and systematization.
FuckTheory	725687595842297856	2016-04-28T14:06:20	A lot of this reputation has to do with the way Freud's intellectual and therapeutic legacy was (mis)handled after his death.

FuckTheory	725684022848921601	2016-04-28T13:52:08	This is the reputation Freud alludes to at the very beginning of "Constructions in Analysis" (the "tails you lose, heads I win" part).

FuckTheory	725682692222799872	2016-04-28T13:46:51	One of the most puzzling things to me in the history of Freud reception is his reputation for stubborn dogmaticism.

FuckTheory	723163770965622788	2016-04-21T14:57:33	(For those of you still stuck on structuralism, in Freud's actual writing, the paradigmatic is privileged over the syntagmatic).
FuckTheory	723163251060662273	2016-04-21T14:55:29	Freud's project is not hermeneutic; it is exegetic.
FuckTheory	723162666462748672	2016-04-21T14:53:10	Let us begin by saying, then, that whatever Derrida might have told you, Freudian psychoanalysis is NOT about interpretation.

FuckTheory	723161688086839296	2016-04-21T14:49:16	In the 20th century, Freud was instrumentalized and misunderstood in two directions.
FuckTheory	723161138473656320	2016-04-21T14:47:05	The French Freud that came to dominate "theory" in the 20th century misunderstands BOTH roots of his project: the German and the Jewish.
FuckTheory	723149078041923584	2016-04-21T13:59:10	Is there an "object petit a" ANYWHERE in Freud's writing? There is not. OK, great. So get that insipid French shit out of my classroom.
FuckTheory	723148813209341953	2016-04-21T13:58:07	If the concepts you use to discuss a thinker *don't appear anywhere* in that thinker's vast corpus your claim to close reading is horseshit.
FuckTheory	723148021454778368	2016-04-21T13:54:58	Nothing has obscured Freud's writing, concepts, and arguments from us as horribly and systematically as the French "return to Freud." Irony!

FuckTheory	723141685539160064	2016-04-21T13:29:47	The Freudian Question is not "Is what you're feeling real?"  The Freudian Question is "What do you think you're feeling?"
FuckTheory	723141590668181504	2016-04-21T13:29:25	Rather, psychoanalysis is an effort to evaluate the narrative relation between the patient's feelings and their ideas about those feelings.
FuckTheory	723141500033441796	2016-04-21T13:29:03	Freudian psychoanalysis is NOT a falsifiable effort to adjudicate the truth-relation between the world and the patient's ideas of the world.
FuckTheory	723140803476992000	2016-04-21T13:26:17	Neither Freud nor Spinoza can be remotely understood in a post-Cartesian epistemology that treats "mind vs. matter" as a first difference.
FuckTheory	723132265870594048	2016-04-21T12:52:21	Both Spinoza and Freud are fundamentally misread if you try to read their arguments as arguments about relations between ideas and *things.*
FuckTheory	723131768921067520	2016-04-21T12:50:23	And just as their object of study is the same, so too does the same basic mistake inform common misreadings of both Freud and Spinoza.
FuckTheory	723130650530865152	2016-04-21T12:45:56	The answer turned out to be exceedingly simple: both Spinozism and psychoanalysis are sciences of the relation between ideas and affects.

FuckTheory	720262771963785216	2016-04-13T14:50:01	Like, Kant's philosophy is more or less antithetical to everything Deleuze loved and valued. More or less the opposite of his own doxa.

FuckTheory	719899436726554624	2016-04-12T14:46:15	How do you write an entire profile of Andrew Sullivan for the Village Voice and not mention the bareback cheating?
FuckTheory	719895108959739904	2016-04-12T14:29:03	If Deleuze is to present to us the text's own concepts, he must present the problems of the text AS problems for the concepts to make sense.
FuckTheory	719894123302502402	2016-04-12T14:25:08	(A concept, we recall, is a philosophical response to a problem situated in a specific plane of immanence).
FuckTheory	719893856439898114	2016-04-12T14:24:05	The question, in essence, is "What problems does the text present as problems, and what concepts does it offer as solutions for them?"
FuckTheory	719893264736874496	2016-04-12T14:21:43	He isn't trying to find his own concepts in the text - he's trying to extract from the text the concepts it makes available.
FuckTheory	719893168603402240	2016-04-12T14:21:21	Deleuze was, first, foremost, and most impressively, a READER.
FuckTheory	719892803187273728	2016-04-12T14:19:53	The answer goes right to the heart of Deleuze's method.
FuckTheory	719891940356042752	2016-04-12T14:16:28	So why is he presenting this as some kind of mystery? Why doesn't he say, "Well, of course affect works that way, it's obvious"?
FuckTheory	719891506438479872	2016-04-12T14:14:44	So he's read Spinoza. Many times. And he understands how association and affect and phenomenal thresholds of experience work.
FuckTheory	719891341417791490	2016-04-12T14:14:05	Now, by this point (1964) Deleuze has written his books on Hume and Nietzsche and is 4 years from writing Difference &amp; Repetition.
FuckTheory	719890340891795456	2016-04-12T14:10:06	And/or, objects associated primarily with pleasure can be experienced as unpleasurable if affective intensity exceeds a certain threshold.

FuckTheory	719889697628098560	2016-04-12T14:07:33	Deleuze is making a pretty straightforward observation here.
FuckTheory	719887372775788544	2016-04-12T13:58:19	If you were used to Deleuze's work, or well-versed in his primary influences, this might strike you as an odd passage.

FuckTheory	719602042122158082	2016-04-11T19:04:31	Rather, he presents a concept of truth as if the minor reading, Spinozist epistemology, was *already lodged within it*, taken for granted.
FuckTheory	719601534825271296	2016-04-11T19:02:30	Deleuze doesn't accept the false concept of truth as a valid one and put up his own in opposition to it, as a challenge.

FuckTheory	719600646207500288	2016-04-11T18:58:58	But that's exactly the superb elegance of the Deleuzian gesture.
FuckTheory	719600511314444292	2016-04-11T18:58:26	The "violence" he speaks of is much like the intensity of affect that Spinoza describes as necessary for a shift in ideas we firmly believe.
FuckTheory	719600276907388928	2016-04-11T18:57:30	Again, the concept of truth above. The word "truth" appears here in such a clearly Spinozan/Nietzschean formulation.
FuckTheory	719599906051239937	2016-04-11T18:56:01	There's still a movement there, shift of concepts towards and away from each other. An image of thought not quite fully crystallized.
FuckTheory	719599661678465025	2016-04-11T18:55:03	All the same elements are in place that you find later in Deleuze. But the constellation doesn't quite feel familiar.

FuckTheory	719598906775052288	2016-04-11T18:52:03	Reading Deleuze's earlier work (the books on masochism, Proust, and Bergson especially) is interesting because they can feel slightly...off.
FuckTheory	719598814345211905	2016-04-11T18:51:41	This is just amazing. "Truth," yes. But what a concept of truth. What a brilliant, brutal realignment.

FuckTheory	719587587288133632	2016-04-11T18:07:04	e.g. Ch II of Proust &amp; Signs, which opens by asserting the importance of truth. A Nietzschean, an anti-Platonist valorizing truth? The fuck?
FuckTheory	719587020474073088	2016-04-11T18:04:49	Deleuze does something similar. But more wryly than Bergson. Deleuze was much more of a trickster. I definitely think he does it to tease.
FuckTheory	719586802391195648	2016-04-11T18:03:57	Think of the opening to Matter &amp; Memory, where Bergson announces that the book is "explicitly dualistic" and you're like...wait wut.
FuckTheory	719586621834862592	2016-04-11T18:03:14	I think it's a trick he learned from Bergson.
FuckTheory	719586327528894464	2016-04-11T18:02:04	One thing that happens when you read Deleuze is he'll suddenly toss out a statement that seems to contradict everything you know about him.

FuckTheory	719293560185581569	2016-04-10T22:38:43	Perhaps the core of the error was ever surrendering to the mislogic of phenomenology by equating Saussure's "sign" with Plato's "idea."
FuckTheory	719293348654227456	2016-04-10T22:37:52	But insofar as we only know things in their representation, a sign IS, because it is the phenomenal consciousness's only access to Being.
FuckTheory	719293153333940224	2016-04-10T22:37:06	Insofar as it *means* something, a sign does: it signifies.
FuckTheory	719293045867429890	2016-04-10T22:36:40	The Saussurean sign, which dominates theories of semiosis in the 20th century, demands of signs that they both be and do.

FuckTheory	719241845084143618	2016-04-10T19:13:13	But the roots of that behavior are often indistinguishable from the rational self-preservation tendencies of an affective animal.
FuckTheory	719241581518327812	2016-04-10T19:12:10	I see a lot of critique of behavior that draws on (the critique, that is) in very real and very problematic behavior.

FuckTheory	718843213130412032	2016-04-09T16:49:12	What Nietzsche calls "the herd" is the social order constituted from by and through the surplus value of depressive labor.
FuckTheory	718842915850698753	2016-04-09T16:48:01	What the priest does is *reroute* the labor by which the depressive seeks to ease his suffering so that it has a useful byproduct.

FuckTheory	718829605243744256	2016-04-09T15:55:07	What he refers to is less a persistent awareness of sadness or a sad affect than a persistent physiological inclination to stasis.

FuckTheory	717705297171771392	2016-04-06T13:27:31	In part, this is because the Socratic revolution wasn't about knowing at all but about the social power and value of knowing.

FuckTheory	713739348252950528	2016-03-26T14:48:15	But a desire denied to doesn't disappear. It's just sublimated or repressed, still yearning, but in increasingly ridiculous ways.
FuckTheory	713739172704567296	2016-03-26T14:47:34	The Left has internalized a set of ideological oppositions that makes them believe they have a moral obligation to refuse that pleasure.
FuckTheory	713738903879032833	2016-03-26T14:46:29	Belief is a form of pleasure. This is one of the most profound and simple insights of Spinoza's Ethics.
FuckTheory	713738393344204800	2016-03-26T14:44:28	How else can you explain the hilarious fantasy that a life-long career politician can possibly be "outside" the political system? I mean...
FuckTheory	713738227866341376	2016-03-26T14:43:48	What they hope for - what YOU hope for - is a candidate that can exceed the limit of the political as a system of predictable functions.
FuckTheory	713737821849329664	2016-03-26T14:42:11	Trapped for decades in a conceptual deadlock where religion, faith, and belief are psychopomps of conservatism, the Left yearns for rapture.
FuckTheory	713737383481643008	2016-03-26T14:40:27	And that's the fantasy of belief itself. What they want isn't a candidate they can believe in - what they want is to believe in a candidate.
FuckTheory	713737217001263104	2016-03-26T14:39:47	The thing with the Bernie rhetoric is, it reveals what fantasy liberals and post-liberals and pseudo-liberals are ACTUALLY clinging to.

FuckTheory	713542335280377856	2016-03-26T01:45:24	(I don't necessarily co-sign either one's reading of Nietzsche, but you could start looking there for further footnotes).
FuckTheory	713542097656287233	2016-03-26T01:44:27	Alexander Nehamas and Elizabeth Grosz are two people who you could look at for very different discussions of Nietzschean aesthetics.
FuckTheory	713540579892793344	2016-03-26T01:38:25	Nietzsche's later work - his Nietzschean work - has many scattered notes on art and aesthetics, but no consistent "theory" of aesthetics.
FuckTheory	713540508761591809	2016-03-26T01:38:08	BoT is N.'s most widely read book because it's simple and centers on an easy opposition that lends itself well to shitty humanities papers.
FuckTheory	713540433629065216	2016-03-26T01:37:50	Nietzsche wrote BoT heavily under the influence of Wagner, and in later years repeatedly repudiated both Wagner and The Birth of Tragedy.
FuckTheory	713540359666720768	2016-03-26T01:37:33	BoT is an early work. Either the last work of Nietzsche's juvenalia or the first work of his mature work, but either way, it's not great.
FuckTheory	713540285314252801	2016-03-26T01:37:15	OK. So.  First things first - I wouldn't really recommend The Birth of Tragedy to anyone, aesthetics or not.

FuckTheory	713146345637482501	2016-03-24T23:31:53	But by far the most important work of art I saw today: my dorter NotTaylerSmith's graduation show. So proud of you! 
FuckTheory	713145377164238852	2016-03-24T23:28:02	And then Glen Ligon at LAG_NYC. I'm ambivalent about a lot of his stuff but these were surprisingly good. 
FuckTheory	713144092197257216	2016-03-24T23:22:55	I went back to the Patti Smith photography show to see if it was better empty and in daylight. Only slightly tbh. 
FuckTheory	713131107982520320	2016-03-24T22:31:20	The portraiture show at Allan Stone Projects was also a solid surprise discovery. Look at this thing. 
FuckTheory	713129450129371136	2016-03-24T22:24:44	There's something almost medieval in the way they fuck with your sense of depth and perspective SO nonchalantly and self-evidently.
FuckTheory	713129294990454784	2016-03-24T22:24:07	The Wehrle paintings and the ones I liked at the Whitney show both combine a dense range of objects each of which occupies its own plane.
FuckTheory	713128405835755520	2016-03-24T22:20:35	Actually depth, surface, and perspective emerged as the dominant themes for the day.
FuckTheory	713128232308973568	2016-03-24T22:19:54	That last one of the pizza box is one of the best paintings I've seen lately. Completely 2-dimensional on the canvas but SO much depth.

FuckTheory	713126318993383424	2016-03-24T22:12:18	Paula Scher at BryceWolkowitz was some of the better (slash only good) big-data derived art I've seen lately. 
FuckTheory	713125468430405632	2016-03-24T22:08:55	I did see some cute shit on my post-Whitney gallery crawl though, and not just at Comme.
FuckTheory	713124703355809792	2016-03-24T22:05:53	It's like Dorothy Parker once said: you can take a horticulture but you can't make her imagine herself as a drone operator.
FuckTheory	713124549269696513	2016-03-24T22:05:16	The bottom line is, I don't know who this show is for. The more likely someone is to care, the less likely they are to need this show.
FuckTheory	713124357262823425	2016-03-24T22:04:30	You have all the resources of the Whitney and god knows what kind of payday and your big insight is...torture memos from 2003? Oooooooh LOL.
FuckTheory	713123547866992640	2016-03-24T22:01:17	Because the thing is, I see regularly what my regular, non-blue chip, non-Oscar-nominated artist friends can/could/do do with $5,000.
FuckTheory	713123170476171264	2016-03-24T21:59:47	I mean, how fucking revolutionary would THAT be? Talk about disrupting the quotidian flows of capital for ethical reasons, right?
FuckTheory	713122801536749569	2016-03-24T21:58:19	When the people from the Whitney call just...say no? No matter how much money they offer?
FuckTheory	713122616492449792	2016-03-24T21:57:35	Maybe in that case...don't?  Like, just don't.
FuckTheory	713121699726635008	2016-03-24T21:53:57	But like...all the money and resources of the Whitney and THAT'S the best you could come up with? Really?
FuckTheory	713121524710965248	2016-03-24T21:53:15	That Poitras show would have been great if it had been the product of a $5,000 grant and was in a small space in Brooklyn or the LES.
FuckTheory	713120437920600064	2016-03-24T21:48:56	Long story short - yes, the scale, exposure, and resources a piece of art or exhibit displays should be directly correlated to quality.
FuckTheory	713119383212597248	2016-03-24T21:44:44	The thing is, I've written many times before about scale in relation to distribution of art world resources (eg: )
FuckTheory	713119002797604864	2016-03-24T21:43:14	So ironically the people to whom this show might possibly represent an ethical awakening are those least likely to give a shit about ethics.
FuckTheory	713116992782249984	2016-03-24T21:35:14	But again it's 20 fucking 16. What woke, self-reflexive person hasn't engaged with these ethical issues?
FuckTheory	713116862658117633	2016-03-24T21:34:43	According to the promo material, "the visitor...decid[es] how deeply to engage with the ethical dilemmas Poitras raises." OK. Like, duh.
FuckTheory	713116781779353600	2016-03-24T21:34:24	But again, that's exactly the problem.
FuckTheory	713113906114244608	2016-03-24T21:22:58	I also understand that not everyone follows the news at the same pace and different thing might be shocking to less aware people later on.
FuckTheory	713113596192894976	2016-03-24T21:21:44	I understand that not everyone is equally engaged in habitual critical reflection, about themselves or about the world.
FuckTheory	713113219229814785	2016-03-24T21:20:15	I mean...it's 2016. Footage of drones flying overhead? Reproductions of the Bush torture memos? Who is this news to? Well, there's the rub.
FuckTheory	713112712071421952	2016-03-24T21:18:14	My feelings about it were more or less summarized here, so that's kind of the mindset I had walking in. 
FuckTheory	713111819678720000	2016-03-24T21:14:41	Then there was the Laura Poitras show on the top floor of the whitneymuseum. Which was...about exactly as good as I expected tbh
FuckTheory	713106085297709056	2016-03-24T20:51:54	Fave discovery at this show was definitely Jamian Juliano-Villani. 
FuckTheory	713093415504773121	2016-03-24T20:01:33	Though I still struggle to understand what these people are supposed to be emerging from. Does the Whitney keep them in a tin can somewhere?
FuckTheory	713093081881518082	2016-03-24T20:00:14	Which was surprisingly good actually.
FuckTheory	713085000921522181	2016-03-24T19:28:07	That shift is not only well underway but rapidly being institutionalized, as this "emerging artist" show. 
FuckTheory	713084704203939840	2016-03-24T19:26:56	If you've been reading me for a while you know I've been predicting a return from conceptual to figurative art for about 10 years now.
FuckTheory	713081455199522818	2016-03-24T19:14:01	But I did see two other temporary shows, one of "emerging" artists (detestable, idiotic term)...and the Laura Poitras thing. Ahem.
FuckTheory	713076364585385986	2016-03-24T18:53:48	So the exhibit I actually wanted to see at the Whitney closed this past weekend because I'm number dyslexic. Oh well.

FuckTheory	713045847999700993	2016-03-24T16:52:32	I think - but am not committed to- the idea that we can conceive a cyclical pre-history in duration without quantified time.
FuckTheory	713045426262421505	2016-03-24T16:50:52	Not that the emergence of time and the emergence of history are unrelated, but you need time to do history, not the reverse.
FuckTheory	713045205235154944	2016-03-24T16:49:59	It translates literally as "pre-time," which marks a distinction between duration and time, not between iterations of human activity.

FuckTheory	711410721406500864	2016-03-20T04:35:08	Relevant to the question of relations of force and active vs. reactive forces: 
FuckTheory	711353906836676608	2016-03-20T00:49:22	Behind the imperative "Use me!" can hide equally the masochist's "Use me like I want!" or the true sub's "Use me like YOU want!"

FuckTheory	710550785378144256	2016-03-17T19:38:03	And since the aim is to begin firmly in the world and then return to the world through a set of coherent principles, you can start anywhere.
FuckTheory	710550458553778176	2016-03-17T19:36:45	An entire host of inevitable dualistic nonsenses are avoided by beginning inquiry from necessity and not from the illusion of certainty.
FuckTheory	710550270443442176	2016-03-17T19:36:00	In other words, we don't have to decide a priori if we're starting in/with the body or the mind.
FuckTheory	710549850845290497	2016-03-17T19:34:20	It then emerges that we can justify a distinction between epistemology and ontology, but that distinction isn't a precondition for inquiry.
FuckTheory	710549504559288320	2016-03-17T19:32:57	When you start in the world, you begin not from a Whole or a Unity in any Neoplatonic sense, but from existence as unitary experience.
FuckTheory	710549230369247232	2016-03-17T19:31:52	This then is an example of *necessity* as a condition or point of departure for inquiry.
FuckTheory	710548750918361088	2016-03-17T19:29:58	Can it be shown or argued deductively in any way that the same question cannot have two answers?   Feel free to try. It cannot.
FuckTheory	710548510802907136	2016-03-17T19:29:00	By this method you begin your inquiry in the world itself as necessary reality.
FuckTheory	710548321337794560	2016-03-17T19:28:15	So: "What epistemological or ontological principles must govern the mind if it's also the case that the same question has multiple answers?"
FuckTheory	710547892751241216	2016-03-17T19:26:33	"It is the case that the same question has had different answers at different times and places in history. Do you agree, o Socrates?"
FuckTheory	710547556707786752	2016-03-17T19:25:13	How does that translate into inquiry from necessity? Like this:
FuckTheory	710547214821625856	2016-03-17T19:23:51	Rough paraphrase: I came to find and weigh different answers from different times, places, people. This demanded formulating new questions.
FuckTheory	710546644333371393	2016-03-17T19:21:35	So what does Nietzsche do instead?  He proceeds from simple insight: 
FuckTheory	710546068178640896	2016-03-17T19:19:18	You can't cut away until you reach a bedrock of certainty. You cannot. BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE NO TOOLS LEFT TO BE CERTAIN YOU'RE CERTAIN.

FuckTheory	710544932713455616	2016-03-17T19:14:47	This is also the fundamental difference between a Spinozan and the Cartesian-phenomenological epistemology.
FuckTheory	710544370110484480	2016-03-17T19:12:33	Like Spinoza, Nietzsche's epistemology is driven not by *certainty* but by *necessity.*   This is the path of pure immanence.
FuckTheory	710542324942512128	2016-03-17T19:04:26	More Peripatetically: in genealogical inquiry the predication "this is a perspective" does not admit of difference.
FuckTheory	710542048839991296	2016-03-17T19:03:20	To put it yet another way, and link back up to univocity: every perspective IS equally a perspective.

FuckTheory	710541496160751618	2016-03-17T19:01:08	Less obscurely: if your explanation of how ancient Greeks knew something can't account for how YOU know something, it's not genealogical.
FuckTheory	710541216992071680	2016-03-17T19:00:02	An inquiry is genealogical if a single set of principles can explain without aporia both your concept of the concept and history's.

FuckTheory	710511369402105856	2016-03-17T17:01:25	An especially common budget-price explanation is that genealogy is distinguished from history by the self-reflexivity of the genealogist.
FuckTheory	710510617623465984	2016-03-17T16:58:26	Chances are also good, unfortunately, that "genealogy" was explained to you as some kind of system-upgraded-historicism.
FuckTheory	710506802601967616	2016-03-17T16:43:16	Chances are good that you were exposed to the concept of "genealogy" in college, if you went in the last 50 years or so.
FuckTheory	710506153273397249	2016-03-17T16:40:42	So what IS genealogy?  Glad you asked.  Genealogy is the epistemological concept that corresponds to the ontological concept of univocity.

FuckTheory	707572694699675648	2016-03-09T14:24:11	Subjectivity has never NOT been about value, and quantification has organized every subjective regime since at least the Babylonians.
FuckTheory	707571550942334976	2016-03-09T14:19:38	It's especially silly when the principles constituting EVERY regime of subjectivity are exactly identical.
FuckTheory	707571097189924864	2016-03-09T14:17:50	The idea that you can step outside your own historical bloc enough to determine a fundamental shift in subjectivity is pretty silly TBH.
FuckTheory	707570793077743616	2016-03-09T14:16:37	You can look at the difference between 500 BC and 1 AD because they are removed BOTH from each other AND from our current position.
FuckTheory	707570592921296896	2016-03-09T14:15:50	But just as importantly, we can see a shift between, say, Greek subjectivity and Roman subjectivity BECAUSE BOTH OF THOSE REGIMES ARE OVER.
FuckTheory	707570125969428480	2016-03-09T14:13:58	But for one fucking thing, these are shifts that need to be discussed in terms of 500-1000 year increments, not 6-month launch cycles.
FuckTheory	707569882360107008	2016-03-09T14:13:00	The citizen of the Athenian polis in 500 BC is not the citizen of the Roman Empire in 1 AD is not the late antique subject is not etc.
FuckTheory	707569604353204224	2016-03-09T14:11:54	Are there differential regimes of subjectivity in history? Yes, of course.
FuckTheory	707569045940387840	2016-03-09T14:09:41	The thing is, an analytical tool that is misapplied constantly everywhere tends to lose its analytic utility.

FuckTheory	707565928012238849	2016-03-09T13:57:17	Like...exactly.   Was nobody else there? Nobody else took a late '90s or early 2000s seminar on postmodernism or "The Subject" or both?
FuckTheory	707565457415471104	2016-03-09T13:55:25	20 years ago we didn't have Apple Watches, smart phones, or Big Data. But what we did have was EXACTLY the same language about subjectivity.

FuckTheory	704844364644814848	2016-03-02T01:42:46	I wish Socrates was the hero of b-movies instead of dialogues. "Socrates vs. the Mind-Whores of Elea" definitely has a ring to it:

FuckTheory	704843275413356544	2016-03-02T01:38:26	Well, since he won't admit philosophy  is all about inherited wealth, how does Socrates explain his ability to himself? Good question.
FuckTheory	704842342214320128	2016-03-02T01:34:44	Look at the slippage from "occupation" to "reputation" in that passage. It's literally "Pay stub? Bitch please I'm a celebrity."
FuckTheory	704842193035534336	2016-03-02T01:34:08	But what happens when Socrates is pressed about the source of his own income? I'm glad you asked: classic evasion. 
FuckTheory	704840953203462144	2016-03-02T01:29:13	Socrates may or may not be a martyr to "truth," but look closely at what his concept of truth is, exactly, before you choose to buy it.
FuckTheory	704840738832523266	2016-03-02T01:28:22	What marks the concept of truth itself in the entire history of philosophy is the domestication of difference and the erasure of privilege.

FuckTheory	704839516276842497	2016-03-02T01:23:30	(Socrates speaks the truth, according to Socrates himself, because he is habituated to parsing definitions philosophically).
FuckTheory	704839319790428160	2016-03-02T01:22:43	In Plato, "truth" is knowledge gained by a genuine or personal labor of thinking, ie, not bought knowledge, which is mere technique.

FuckTheory	704695031786020865	2016-03-01T15:49:22	Apparently his brother started as an engineering student, "But it was too hard doing engineering and wrestling at the same time."

FuckTheory	700838850768273408	2016-02-20T00:26:17	Because, really: Why do you think I owe you an answer? Or an explanation? What makes you think you're entitled to free intellectual labor?
FuckTheory	700836789947396096	2016-02-20T00:18:06	Or to put it less subtly: Why does the rule of reason so often simply hide behind it the demand for mastery?
FuckTheory	700836633407578114	2016-02-20T00:17:28	So the question, to me, is: Why do people feel entitled to a defense or an explanation?

FuckTheory	700830723297714176	2016-02-19T23:53:59	The thing is, I don't think we can attribute the inclination to defend one's positions as simply weakness of ego or lacking sense of self.

FuckTheory	700753306478624769	2016-02-19T18:46:22	The secret is learning to believe in the feeling of certainty AS a feeling: that is, knowing how to feel certain. Literally.
FuckTheory	700753087686975489	2016-02-19T18:45:30	Once you see that belief and certainty are feelings and not the factual output of verifiable formulas, the idea of proof changes meaning.

FuckTheory	700744553356206080	2016-02-19T18:11:35	It's amazing to me how many intelligent people reflexively start defending themselves just because someone questioned something they said.
