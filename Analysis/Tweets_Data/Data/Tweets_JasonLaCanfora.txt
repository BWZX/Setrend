JasonLaCanfora	726246762965532673	2016-04-30T03:08:15	Maccagnan on drafting Hackenberg: "It doesn't change anything as far as our approach to Ryan."  The goal remains to re-sign Fitzpatrick.
JasonLaCanfora	726245198410465281	2016-04-30T03:02:02	Pats fans don't freak like this QB would have to be the No. 2 if Brady suspended. They'll find a vet via trade or free agency
JasonLaCanfora	726244268575211521	2016-04-30T02:58:21	Still a bunch of teams to come here that could go developmental QB - Pats, Cards, Browns and plenty of passers there including Cook
JasonLaCanfora	726242912015646720	2016-04-30T02:52:57	masnRoch holy crabcakes
JasonLaCanfora	726241667783778305	2016-04-30T02:48:01	If Osweiler doesn't get it done, it shouldn't be for lack of athleticism and options around him now. Miller joins the mix in Houston
JasonLaCanfora	726240358649225217	2016-04-30T02:42:49	hard not to like what Washington is doing. That sleeping giant is awake and seems to only be getting stronger under new management
JasonLaCanfora	726240232757166080	2016-04-30T02:42:19	If Fuller can be healthy, this is a total steal. He had a very low medical grade from teams on the re-check but has 1st round talent ...
JasonLaCanfora	726237883598823424	2016-04-30T02:32:58	Midway through the 3rd round and there have been, what, 3 QBs, 3 RBs and 2TEs gone so far?  Shaping up as slim on skill guys as expected.
JasonLaCanfora	726234688025583617	2016-04-30T02:20:17	How awesome that Shon Coleman, leukemia survivor drafted by Browns, spent his draft day with sick kids StJude. Nice job KayleeHartung
JasonLaCanfora	726234472316866560	2016-04-30T02:19:25	NattyBohs jeffzrebiecsun with all those 4th round picks they could move around for sure if they so desire
JasonLaCanfora	726232433641807872	2016-04-30T02:11:19	CliftonBrownCSN have to wonder if a corner like Cyrus Jones was a potential target
JasonLaCanfora	726231895558787072	2016-04-30T02:09:11	Bullard is a kid I heard a lot about before the draft. Definitely very worthy of a look here. Had nice developmental upside
JasonLaCanfora	726229633348280321	2016-04-30T02:00:11	Ravens continue to go volume at pass rusher and for good reason. Huge issue moving forward and draft only way to get it w/o breaking bank
JasonLaCanfora	726228191342292992	2016-04-30T01:54:28	With 3rd rd pick Ravens @ number 70, select DE Bronson Kaufusi of BYU. 1057TheFan
JasonLaCanfora	726226872434970625	2016-04-30T01:49:13	He is the Panthers No. 2 pick.  
JasonLaCanfora	726225608544497664	2016-04-30T01:44:12	masnRoch I would have taken him over Hackenberg, based on what I have heard about both, but there are differing views on both
JasonLaCanfora	726225253551190018	2016-04-30T01:42:47	masnRoch Taken Hackenberg there? I don't mind it. Their new regime believes in taking them with some regularity. I tend to agree
JasonLaCanfora	726224869667540992	2016-04-30T01:41:16	Would expect someone to be grabbing Connor Cook here soon enough. Surprised he is still on the board
JasonLaCanfora	726224091703873537	2016-04-30T01:38:10	Broncos take DT Adam Gotsis - on to the third round
JasonLaCanfora	726223012748468224	2016-04-30T01:33:53	Panthers take James Bradberry from Samford - second round is nearly complete
JasonLaCanfora	726222806355197952	2016-04-30T01:33:04	Bengals (WR) and Panthers (CB) didn't force obvious need in 1st round and I bet they prosper. But CIN went WR in 2nd and CAR goes CB here
JasonLaCanfora	726221802956017664	2016-04-30T01:29:05	Vonn Bell goes off the board. Saints take the safety here; have had some bad picks in their secondary in recent years
JasonLaCanfora	726221214209945600	2016-04-30T01:26:44	Love Cyrus Jones. Explosive return guy and great slot corner. Had him on my Bmoreopinionate podcast this week. Great kid. Nice pick 4 Pats
JasonLaCanfora	726220849200660481	2016-04-30T01:25:17	And here come the Patriots after missing the first round due to this ridiculous Deflategate nonsense
JasonLaCanfora	726220267555540992	2016-04-30T01:22:58	Aguayo was phenomenal inside 40...perfect for his career.  Only 20-29 over 40yds which is where an NFL kicker makes his money
JasonLaCanfora	726220339559206915	2016-04-30T01:23:16	Any chance the Bucs had a gas-mask apparatus being passed around their war room when they made that pick? I kid. I kid.
JasonLaCanfora	726220089083760640	2016-04-30T01:22:16	Thoughts go out to all the players selected AFTER a KICKER  Buccaneers NFLDraft
JasonLaCanfora	726219646924382209	2016-04-30T01:20:30	Bucs have not only taken a kicker in the second round, they traded up to do so. Roberto Aguayo is their guy
JasonLaCanfora	726219213673775104	2016-04-30T01:18:47	Steelers take DB Sean Davis out of Maryland
JasonLaCanfora	726218030703861761	2016-04-30T01:14:05	Colts take CB TJ Green from Clemson

JasonLaCanfora	726216327082446853	2016-04-30T01:07:19	Duke Tobin continues to kill it for the Bengals. They have drafted like demons and totally turned that franchise around
JasonLaCanfora	726215996328034304	2016-04-30T01:06:00	Bengals were not going to force a WR in 1st round and  get a promising one this time around with Boyd out of PIT
JasonLaCanfora	726215608195518464	2016-04-30T01:04:28	Vikings take CB Mackensie Alexander, who some thought would go late first round.
JasonLaCanfora	726214859872985088	2016-04-30T01:01:29	WillBrinson Tom brady is like 36. Osweiler has like 6 career appearances and is a relative kid. apples/oranges

JasonLaCanfora	726211228520030208	2016-04-30T00:47:03	Jets take Christian Hackenberg, and Ryan Fitzpatrick can call Sam Bradford to bemoan their lack of leverage. Better take the $ Fitzy ASAP
JasonLaCanfora	726210751493447680	2016-04-30T00:45:10	Jets could end the QB drougt here. None gone since 26th pick. Hackenberg and Cook on the board
JasonLaCanfora	726210580936269824	2016-04-30T00:44:29	Texans were also big on Bama C Ryan Kelly in 1st round. He went just before them. Address C here with OL Nick Martin from Norte Dame
JasonLaCanfora	726209136317337600	2016-04-30T00:38:45	Texans need secondary help and make trade. Would have pounced on S Karl Joseph in the first round. S Von Bell out there. CB Alexander too
JasonLaCanfora	726208017428045824	2016-04-30T00:34:18	And Seattle indeed sees too much value in Bama DL Jarran Reed to let him slide any further. Should fit well in their rotation
JasonLaCanfora	726207089589293056	2016-04-30T00:30:37	Seahawks jump up via trade as well. Trying to rebuild OL, but they wont hesitate to take player they value highly regardless of position
JasonLaCanfora	726206428113936385	2016-04-30T00:27:59	Packers take tackle Spriggs, fortifies the OL with some depth after injuries struck, Last of the guys I had mocked in 1st rnd
JasonLaCanfora	726205544684474368	2016-04-30T00:24:28	Saints take WR Michael Thomas and Packers on the clock after trading up into the Colts spot.
JasonLaCanfora	726203850722521088	2016-04-30T00:17:44	The Lions take the other Bama DL, A'Shawn Robinson.
JasonLaCanfora	726203604403666944	2016-04-30T00:16:46	We had J. Reed to the Lions at 16 in the mock I did with a top scout. Could he end up being the pick all the way down here
JasonLaCanfora	726203060985294848	2016-04-30T00:14:36	Does Mike Mularkey know it’s not the 1970s?
JasonLaCanfora	726202498642526208	2016-04-30T00:12:22	Didn't they already make the bizarre trade for Murray in the first place? This team has needs all over the place and more RBs than they need
JasonLaCanfora	726202312767733761	2016-04-30T00:11:38	Titans go with RB Derrick Henry from Alabama.The 2nrd RB in the draft goes 41 picks after the 1st
JasonLaCanfora	726201077234733057	2016-04-30T00:06:43	Raiders take DE Jihad Ward from Illinois
JasonLaCanfora	726199987865042944	2016-04-30T00:02:23	With the 43rd overall pick in the 2016 NFLDraft, the Titans select PennStateFball DL Austin Johnson. 
JasonLaCanfora	726199718007574528	2016-04-30T00:01:19	Correa grade B. This kid is a nice pass rusher. He fits the Ravens scheme perfectly.
JasonLaCanfora	726199693777199104	2016-04-30T00:01:13	Ravens have bigtime need for pass rusher. Select Boise State DE Kamalei Correa here
JasonLaCanfora	726198687706284032	2016-04-29T23:57:13	Ragland is a sure tackler and can fill that David Harris role in Rex Ryan's defense, but nt sure much flash there. 2-down player many think
JasonLaCanfora	726197737981677568	2016-04-29T23:53:27	Bills traded up to the Bears spot and take LB Reggie Ragland. Maybe the run on 'Bama guys starts now as Ravens up next
JasonLaCanfora	726197212640870400	2016-04-29T23:51:22	Giants take WR Sterling Shepard from Oklahoma
JasonLaCanfora	726196575777751041	2016-04-29T23:48:50	Bucs go with DE Noah Spence. Ton of talent. Ton of questions about him. Another boom or bust pick.
JasonLaCanfora	726195727437824000	2016-04-29T23:45:28	With so many DLs on the board still with fairly similar grades, including both from Alabama, Ravens comfortable with the depth there
JasonLaCanfora	726195571753639936	2016-04-29T23:44:51	By trading down twice in this round, Ravens have picked up an extra 4th rnd pick (they already had 4 of them) and an extra 5th...
JasonLaCanfora	726195368615096320	2016-04-29T23:44:02	Fins take CB Xavien Howard
JasonLaCanfora	726193914491863041	2016-04-29T23:38:15	Ravens trade down again and the Dolphins are on the clock. have to wonder if Jones was on the Ravens radar
JasonLaCanfora	726193620005601280	2016-04-29T23:37:05	Love this Chris Jones pick. Evaluators I trust the most love him. KC gets a guy they likely take in 1st in 2nd and got a lot from SF for it
JasonLaCanfora	726192744809422849	2016-04-29T23:33:37	Jaguars draft room right now 
JasonLaCanfora	726192513363615745	2016-04-29T23:32:41	The Jags come out of the first 36 picks with Ramsey and Myles Jack. Tremendous athleticism and speed to that defense. Look out
JasonLaCanfora	726190767375527936	2016-04-29T23:25:45	Jags make the trade and that has to mean Myles Jack is next man up. He coulda been their pick at 5 if not for the knee
JasonLaCanfora	726190524638568448	2016-04-29T23:24:47	Would have to think that indicates Myles Jack is off the board soon as well
JasonLaCanfora	726190330643660800	2016-04-29T23:24:01	Love the Cowboys taking Jaylon Smith here. Go big or go home. Tremendous upside but have to wait a while for it. The kid deserves it ...
JasonLaCanfora	726189880871653376	2016-04-29T23:22:14	Plenty of DL on  the board still for Dallas that has no pass rush. Also two injuried LBs with tremendous upside
JasonLaCanfora	726189588948107264	2016-04-29T23:21:04	The TItans take DL Kevin Dodd from Clemson. Some evaluators I trust rated him higher than teammate Shaq Lawson who went 19th overall
JasonLaCanfora	726188559904964608	2016-04-29T23:16:59	Titans also have 3 of the first 14 picks in this round, so taking a flier on Myles Jack would be a mitigated risk at best
JasonLaCanfora	726188245634154497	2016-04-29T23:15:44	Titans were praying S Keanu Neal would be here for them. Could very well go with more secondary help here - M. Alexander or V. Bell, maybe?
JasonLaCanfora	726187557734780928	2016-04-29T23:13:00	Browns go with a pass rusher in Ogbah, a player who may have been gone in the first round had KC not traded down, for instance
JasonLaCanfora	726186985388408832	2016-04-29T23:10:43	Browns on the clock, and, as always, open to trade
JasonLaCanfora	726182998203359232	2016-04-29T22:54:53	You guys act like what I'm doing is something new. I've been the same person, doing the same things since it all started.
JasonLaCanfora	726182594337996800	2016-04-29T22:53:16	'Cuz after tonite there'll be even fewer QB jobs available and no one was going after Bradford the 1st time around in March. It's ridiculous
JasonLaCanfora	726181828713963520	2016-04-29T22:50:14	Go ahead and give that $5.5M back -you've already made $78M for 63 starts - and maybe they set you free. Otherwise, be a pro and get to work
JasonLaCanfora	726181471086632960	2016-04-29T22:48:49	Is Sam Bradford and his agent really want to leave Philly, it's simple. They got an $11M signing bonus; $5.5M paid already and $5.5M due 9/1
JasonLaCanfora	726170367572774914	2016-04-29T22:04:41	Name I look forward to hearing called in next 2 days: Keenan Reynolds. Tremendous young man. Pats are all over him
JasonLaCanfora	726169190932070403	2016-04-29T22:00:01	TOMORROW: bobmouldmusic joins us on CBSThisMorning's SaturdaySessions! 
JasonLaCanfora	726153147488583682	2016-04-29T20:56:16	Tunsil's intro press conference delayed. We'll see if Fins have upper management acumen to handle all this: 
JasonLaCanfora	726152659133026304	2016-04-29T20:54:19	The orchestrated humiliation of an incoming employee example of what NFLCommish says makes NFL Draft 'exciting' 
JasonLaCanfora	726145666079154176	2016-04-29T20:26:32	If Connor Cook is still on the board when the Bills pick tonight, that could very well be his spot. Wouldn't be surprised if goes sooner
JasonLaCanfora	726140937878036480	2016-04-29T20:07:45	Differing views on Tunsil selection. Why it may and may not work. And why I'm rooting for this kid: 
JasonLaCanfora	726140595715084289	2016-04-29T20:06:23	Inside the draft - which teams were trying to trade, who they wanted, Tunsil insight, Browns fallout and much more: 
JasonLaCanfora	726118757882548225	2016-04-29T18:39:37	Have column forthcoming on Rnd 1 fallout. Forgot to mention CAR in it. Evaluators love their pick, CB need or not. Gettleman trust his board
JasonLaCanfora	726117543774158849	2016-04-29T18:34:47	He woke up this morning in Chitown and hit the gym.  
JasonLaCanfora	726117307941007361	2016-04-29T18:33:51	Mattyshack PriscoCBS thank you sir! It's the Italian blood I think. We tend to get a little working up
JasonLaCanfora	726100774418276352	2016-04-29T17:28:09	Are there two better on-camera reactionists then PriscoCBS or JasonLaCanfora ??? Answer: NO. Could watch them all day! They get so pumped!
JasonLaCanfora	726091692617650176	2016-04-29T16:52:04	Pretty strong consensus around the league the Browns end up trading out of the top pick tonight. Someone could be moving up for a QB or DL
JasonLaCanfora	726090459840389121	2016-04-29T16:47:10	Several teams in teens told me they had talks with the Jets, who would've pounced on Tunsil who was seen by some as best player in the draft
JasonLaCanfora	726090315837349888	2016-04-29T16:46:36	As reported last night, DAL was trying hard to move up for Lynch late 1. Also, NYJ were heavily exploring moving up from 20 for Tunsil...
JasonLaCanfora	726023742720192512	2016-04-29T12:22:03	To me, the most offensive part of the Tunsil story is that the Dolphins intend to play him at guard.
JasonLaCanfora	725903279566123008	2016-04-29T04:23:23	Besides DEN, DAL was making calls from pick 22 on down seeking a trade. Would assume that was for Paxton Lynch as well
JasonLaCanfora	725895768222093313	2016-04-29T03:53:32	Tough night for Tunsil, Myles Jack .. but Nick Saban also. Bama players largely passed on and maybe an extra day in Chicago for him?
JasonLaCanfora	725892886068400128	2016-04-29T03:42:05	Big stories FRi include when next QBs go, how far could Myles Jack tumble, and when do Bama players start getting some love?
JasonLaCanfora	725892710800982016	2016-04-29T03:41:23	So 1st round is over. Had the trades except for the SF/KC one in the mock. Coleman, Clark, Garnett, Ifede only guys I didn't have in mock
JasonLaCanfora	725892314447659008	2016-04-29T03:39:48	Seahawks take OL Germain Ifede. So they get their pick of the 2nd tier of OL here and they got a haul from SF to drop back and get him
JasonLaCanfora	725891706902695937	2016-04-29T03:37:23	If the Panthers don't take Butler there, I'd bet you a zeekspizza that the Seahawks would have pounced on him
JasonLaCanfora	725890986723921920	2016-04-29T03:34:32	Panthers take Vernon Butler. They will follow their board. Didnt see him getting past Green Bay and KC. I like it
JasonLaCanfora	725889909941276672	2016-04-29T03:30:15	I am surprised Vernon Butler and Jarran Reed are on the board still. Panthers could also use an OT. Spriggs is out there
JasonLaCanfora	725889466313879552	2016-04-29T03:28:29	CAR has obvious need at corner post Josh Norman, but they don't force picks and not much left. Some good DL talent there right now
JasonLaCanfora	725889312051580928	2016-04-29T03:27:53	Also, knee issues or not, I did not foresee a scenario where 30 picks were made without Myles Jack hearing his name called
JasonLaCanfora	725888711439863808	2016-04-29T03:25:29	Cardinals take Robert Nkemdiche. Could be a huge boost for them if they can keep him and Chandler Jones on right path. Big upside
JasonLaCanfora	725888228218310657	2016-04-29T03:23:34	Not a ton has really surprised me to this point, but both Alabama DL still being out here I didnt see coming
JasonLaCanfora	725887632916512768	2016-04-29T03:21:12	Cards still have guys like Reed, Butler and Nkemdiche here to pick from, and at least one CB, Alexander, who they may consider
JasonLaCanfora	725886997303271424	2016-04-29T03:18:41	And the 49ers take G Josh Garnett. Did not see that one coming
JasonLaCanfora	725886773038043136	2016-04-29T03:17:47	And the Chiefs trade out. Had Connor Cook going to pick 28 in the mock I did with a scout. Also a bunch of DL available
JasonLaCanfora	725885885288427524	2016-04-29T03:14:16	With do many DL still on board, does KC or AZ trade down, and does someone move up for Connor Cook?
JasonLaCanfora	725885506958069760	2016-04-29T03:12:45	Packers take DT Kenny Clark from UCLA. Address DL. 2nd player to this point I did not have going in 1st round in my mock or my scout mock
JasonLaCanfora	725885009953980416	2016-04-29T03:10:47	49ers might be the team most unhappy about that Broncos trade and pick. No Kaepernick to DEN now. Some teams think Kap just gets cut
JasonLaCanfora	725883761490051073	2016-04-29T03:05:49	Packers have some need at LB, and M. Jack, Ragland still there. Heard they were big fans of DL Vernon Butler as well
JasonLaCanfora	725883378420056069	2016-04-29T03:04:18	Broncos grab Paxton Lynch at pick 26. Have to be excited if you are this kid. Kubiak/Elway can develop QBs and that D will help
JasonLaCanfora	725883029776949248	2016-04-29T03:02:55	Could still be another one to come
JasonLaCanfora	725882979944378369	2016-04-29T03:02:43	Going to toot my horn a bit here - projected every trade that has occurred pretty much exactly in my mock. This was last one i had at 26...
JasonLaCanfora	725881770617380865	2016-04-29T02:57:55	Broncos have traded 1-31 and 3-94 to Seattle for 1-26.
JasonLaCanfora	725882454649753601	2016-04-29T03:00:38	So Seattle trades out of 26 as expected all along - and we'll see if Denver went up there to grab its next QB
JasonLaCanfora	725881532339081218	2016-04-29T02:56:58	Steelers take Artie Burns, a corner that would have been in play for the Cardinals among others
JasonLaCanfora	725881072798552065	2016-04-29T02:55:08	Jackson Grade: A. Love this pick. He was my top corner.
JasonLaCanfora	725877958766895104	2016-04-29T02:42:46	Lions GM Bob Quinn: If we took players off the board because they smoked pot in college, like half the board would be gone.
JasonLaCanfora	725880696980553728	2016-04-29T02:53:39	Bengals do in fact take the corner the Steelers would have grabbed - William Jackson III. Mackensie Alexander/Artie Burns still there
JasonLaCanfora	725880178984009728	2016-04-29T02:51:35	Assuming the Bengals did not take him, given the options available at CB here I would figure the Steelers tab William Jackson III
JasonLaCanfora	725879789584846853	2016-04-29T02:50:02	hearing Denver calling teams about a potential move up. Would have to wonder if that's for a QB if they do it
JasonLaCanfora	725879226776313856	2016-04-29T02:47:48	Obviously there are concerns about Nkemdiche's character, etc. but the Bengals rarely shy away from that. A lot of DL still on board
JasonLaCanfora	725879030650658816	2016-04-29T02:47:01	Vikes take Treadwell, last 1st round rated WRs available. I had the Bengals taking Nkemdiche. Figured they were going DL even if WR there
JasonLaCanfora	725878202342633472	2016-04-29T02:43:44	Our top rated receiver JoshDoctson love the pick. All business, worker, excellent hands Good pick Redskins
JasonLaCanfora	725877869138812929	2016-04-29T02:42:24	Skins have garcon and DeSean both making big $ and both possibly gone after 2016. So they fortify WR. Most would think Treadwell to MIN
JasonLaCanfora	725877560861593601	2016-04-29T02:41:11	I wasn't convinced this run on WRs would happen as many projected ...but it does. Skins take Josh Doctson who some thought was best in draft
JasonLaCanfora	725876169934036994	2016-04-29T02:35:39	DraftnastyCom you were all over a bunch of these too man. Had a blast doing the show. See you next year!
JasonLaCanfora	725875602222387200	2016-04-29T02:33:24	Smart for the Texans, with the Vikings and Bengals perhaps angling to move up a few spot to get pick of Fuller/Doctson/Treadwell
JasonLaCanfora	725875444113924096	2016-04-29T02:32:46	The Skins picked up an extra 6th to make that swap one pick down. Texans take WR Will Fuller
JasonLaCanfora	725874325325225984	2016-04-29T02:28:19	And with more options than they thought would be available, Skins trade back. Texans also liked Kelly and K. Joseph, like the Skins
JasonLaCanfora	725873918574223360	2016-04-29T02:26:42	What I reported on Skins before draft was they loved Kelly (gone) otherwise Alabama DL (Reed or Robinson) very much in play. Both there
JasonLaCanfora	725873718052945920	2016-04-29T02:25:55	The Jets take a LB, but not Myles Jack. They take Darron Lee. Add some speed. Have been long in tooth at LB.
JasonLaCanfora	725872381743513600	2016-04-29T02:20:36	In the end there could be enough value to trade out of 26 for someone to get a QB there, but if Jack is on the board they would consider
JasonLaCanfora	725872208074162176	2016-04-29T02:19:55	Even though SEA has Wagner, etc, I wrote about their medical team and sports science group and they are willing to gamble on medical guys,,,
JasonLaCanfora	725872041430253568	2016-04-29T02:19:15	Jets go go WR here with someone like Doctson or Treadwell. Myles Jack would fill a need, If Jack gets past NY, Seattle is a possibility ...
JasonLaCanfora	725871698617241600	2016-04-29T02:17:53	As a lot of us reported, Rex spent a lot of time around Clemson program. Coulda been Lawson or Dodd or an Alabama kid. He goes Lawson
JasonLaCanfora	725871482778308608	2016-04-29T02:17:02	I tried to tell my man DraftnastyCom that Neal was going to go in the first round and as high as 17. He didn't believe!
JasonLaCanfora	725870599927676928	2016-04-29T02:13:31	Also, you still have LBs like Myles Jack and Darron Lee still on the board as well. LB a position Jets could target ahead as well as WR
JasonLaCanfora	725870280162299904	2016-04-29T02:12:15	So it is Ryan Kelly. Another one that falls as I had it. I was thinking Shaq Lawson to Bills, but Reed, Spence, Robinson out there too
JasonLaCanfora	725869927622709248	2016-04-29T02:10:51	Colts have a plethora of options on DL, and the top C on the board, Ryan Kelly, as the OL gets picked through
JasonLaCanfora	725869673150033921	2016-04-29T02:09:50	Neal was the one player I had tabbed to go way, way higher than anyone was projecting. They see Neal as Earl Thomas/Kam hybrid
JasonLaCanfora	725869357163749376	2016-04-29T02:08:35	My mean Keanu Neal is off the board. As I reported, Dan Quinn loved this kid and wanted him. Thought they'd go LB in the end. Bold pick.
JasonLaCanfora	725868035408584704	2016-04-29T02:03:20	Lions take Taylor Decker. Hoo-ray, got that one right in the mock at least. Falcons have a lot of options - M. Jack, D. Lee, J. Reed
JasonLaCanfora	725866801544966144	2016-04-29T01:58:26	Browns do take a WR but it's one many execs I spoke to didn't think would go this his. Take Coleman from Baylor.
JasonLaCanfora	725865759348527105	2016-04-29T01:54:17	We'll see if the Browns finally make a pick here, and if the pick is a WR. That's what they were thinking. Myles Jack still there too
JasonLaCanfora	725865335849635841	2016-04-29T01:52:36	If not for concerns about Joseph's knee he probably goes even a little higher
JasonLaCanfora	725865150012637184	2016-04-29T01:51:52	Raiders go Karl Joseph, S from WVU. Texans, Skins, others really liked him. Wasnt getting past 22. Fla S Keanu Neal could go 1st rnd too
JasonLaCanfora	725864778267279360	2016-04-29T01:50:23	I mocked Myles Jack here. Could two potential top-five picks both have their slides end consecutively?
JasonLaCanfora	725863948180946944	2016-04-29T01:47:05	Very, very strong relationship between Dolphin boss Mike Tannenbaum and Tunsil's agent, Jimmy Sexton. Probably helped in this instance
JasonLaCanfora	725863426749243392	2016-04-29T01:45:01	If there was anyone in a mock draft anywhere in the world who had Tunsil to Miami at 13, raise your gas mask
JasonLaCanfora	725862757183176704	2016-04-29T01:42:21	Sounds like Tunsil's drop might not turn out to be a total freefall
JasonLaCanfora	725862552119463936	2016-04-29T01:41:32	We should be in Myles Jack terrain here. MIA, OAK, ATL, NYJ all possibilities
JasonLaCanfora	725861737703084032	2016-04-29T01:38:18	Absolutely love this pick for the Saints. If this kid was off the board, very good chance they were trading down. Rankins immediate impact
JasonLaCanfora	725860636685651968	2016-04-29T01:33:56	So far on trade front, had TB dropping back few spots for Hargreaves, TEN moving up for Conklin, CLE traded back for WR. Treadwell at 15?
JasonLaCanfora	725859513107111937	2016-04-29T01:29:28	Bucs take Hargreaves as expected. They were pretty locked in on him. Now Rankins is sitting there for the Saints
JasonLaCanfora	725858828424728576	2016-04-29T01:26:45	Had heard persistently that Apple would have been Miami's pick at 13 if no trade for Elliott and Elliott gone by that pick
JasonLaCanfora	725857948581416960	2016-04-29T01:23:15	Giants take Eli Apple and a mini run on corners could be coming
JasonLaCanfora	725856338602037248	2016-04-29T01:16:51	Bears grab Leonard Floyd. Sheldon Rankins would make a lot of sense for the Giants among others
JasonLaCanfora	725855636752338944	2016-04-29T01:14:04	At some point would a team like the Jets or Seahawks see enough need and value on Tunsil to break his fall?
JasonLaCanfora	725855456397266944	2016-04-29T01:13:21	And there is no way the Titans had Conklin ahead of Tunsil as they sorted through all the tackle options before trading down
JasonLaCanfora	725855276637769728	2016-04-29T01:12:38	This Tunsil thing is damning. Everything I heard about BAL top brass on tackles was Tunsil over Stnaley. Some BAL coaches liked Stanley...
JasonLaCanfora	725854882041835520	2016-04-29T01:11:04	Bucs pick up an extra 4th round pick to move back and still can get the player they wanted in Hargreaves
JasonLaCanfora	725854514469806081	2016-04-29T01:09:36	And the Bucs trade down as I mocked up. In this case the Bears move up. Either for Leonard Floyd or Shaldon Rankins. Bucs can get CB at 11
JasonLaCanfora	725854292675010560	2016-04-29T01:08:43	To clarify, Browns and Titans swap 1s today, Browns also send a 6th to TEN. CLE gets a 3rd this yrs and a 2nd next year. Nice for Browns
JasonLaCanfora	725853628196593664	2016-04-29T01:06:05	Browns swap 1st round picks and give up a 6th and the Titans give up a 1st, 3rd and 2nd in 2017. Titans take Conklin. Tunsil plummeting
JasonLaCanfora	725853226701062144	2016-04-29T01:04:29	Browns accomplish their goal of trading down again and the Titans move up to almost certainly address OL as they had hoped
JasonLaCanfora	725852568593797123	2016-04-29T01:01:52	The Bucs were hoping somehow Buckner would fall to them at 9. Otherwise were looking to trade down to maybe still get Hargreaves
JasonLaCanfora	725852299462070272	2016-04-29T01:00:48	If Buckner goes, all the top guys would be gone for the Browns. They have a LT, and now Tunsil has issues. Myles Jack has the knee concerns
JasonLaCanfora	725852090703187968	2016-04-29T00:59:58	Of the top 8 players, the top quarter of the draft, only Buckner and Tunsil are still on the board
JasonLaCanfora	725850411345797120	2016-04-29T00:53:18	The Ravens take Ronnie Stanley - passing on Tunsil - and the 49ers are on the clock
JasonLaCanfora	725848744428711936	2016-04-29T00:46:40	The top 8 players to go most believed would be Goff, Wentz, and then Tunsil, Ramsey, Bosa, Stanley, Buckner and Elliott in some order
JasonLaCanfora	725848465792708608	2016-04-29T00:45:34	Would imagine the Jags jump on Jalen Ramsey and the Ravens select DeForest Buckner. And the 49ers looking hard at tackles....
JasonLaCanfora	725848024941883393	2016-04-29T00:43:49	The Cowboys now have two runners selected #4 overall in a draft, McFadden &amp; Ezekiel Elliott
JasonLaCanfora	725847103654735873	2016-04-29T00:40:09	Jags would be improved by welcoming Buckner or Ramsey to their roster. Both would fit very well with BAL at 6 as well
JasonLaCanfora	725846727220183040	2016-04-29T00:38:40	RB Ezekiel Eilliott goes to Dallas with the 4th pick
JasonLaCanfora	725845964595027968	2016-04-29T00:35:38	Within DAL facility, Eliott is in play, bit Jalen Ramsey has been seen as the safe pick. Multiple positions. Good value. I mocked him here
JasonLaCanfora	725844363398504449	2016-04-29T00:29:16	Have a feeling I will be kicking myself in the face for not listening to my man who kept telling me it would be Bosa to SD. We'll see
JasonLaCanfora	725844062843113472	2016-04-29T00:28:04	Teams are definitely aware of the Laremy Tunsil video. Have heard from several of them. I've reached out to his agent for comment/context
JasonLaCanfora	725842927860199425	2016-04-29T00:23:34	Eagles take Carson Wentz and now the intrigue begins with the Chargers and the 3rd overall pick. Stanley? Bosa? Buckner? Ramsey? Tunsil?
JasonLaCanfora	725841326789562369	2016-04-29T00:17:12	Goff to the Rams. No surprise. Every mock in the universe is now 1-for-1. It'll be 2-for-2 when Eagles take Wentz. Then the draft is on
JasonLaCanfora	725839439948320773	2016-04-29T00:09:42	Rams, who hope to be hosting the draft and maybe the combine and who knows what else, will milk this full 10 mins for the league and for TV
JasonLaCanfora	725838406584926208	2016-04-29T00:05:36	Any rumor about where Laremy Tunsil will go is probably a smokescreen.
JasonLaCanfora	725834219960852481	2016-04-28T23:48:58	A top evaluator who did an anonymous mock for me cbssports is convinced Bosa is going at 3. Most teams I ask think a OT to SD

JasonLaCanfora	725707699212718080	2016-04-28T15:26:13	Interesting dynamic at bottom of top 10, with the Browns and Bucs very open to drop. Teams could move up for Elliott/Rankins/Floyd there

JasonLaCanfora	723691513209872384	2016-04-23T01:54:36	So the Caps have yet again wasted a chance to close out series quickly against inferior opponent. Shocker
JasonLaCanfora	723691178965782528	2016-04-23T01:53:17	Should amount to a 3-year, $51M deal for Josh Norman, with $36.5M fully guar at signing (by '18 he's over 30). That's Revis cheddar, folks.
JasonLaCanfora	723690635803410432	2016-04-23T01:51:07	The numbers that matter most on Norman deal: $15M signing bonus alone eclipses the $14M franchise tag. He'll make $20M total in '16. Wow
JasonLaCanfora	723672182610649088	2016-04-23T00:37:48	Congrats J_No24 ! Happy for you, now you can finally be the best FIFA player on a team 😄🤑
JasonLaCanfora	723671914464448512	2016-04-23T00:36:44	I doubt Josh Norman has $50M fully GTD at signing. It should exceed the $28.8M Janoris Jenkins has fully GTD at signing.
JasonLaCanfora	723672078986141696	2016-04-23T00:37:23	As with all big contract, devil will be in the details w/Norman's deal, particularly the true guar at time of signing and how far it extends
JasonLaCanfora	723670211434557440	2016-04-23T00:29:58	sftokarski dude had a $200k signing bonus and had made $2m his entire career. He wasn't missing paycheck. Period. That's BS
JasonLaCanfora	723665620206755842	2016-04-23T00:11:43	Not sure of how much Norman rubbed Panthers wrong way or whatever, but renting him for 2016 at $14M would look pretty good to me right now
JasonLaCanfora	723661724348346369	2016-04-22T23:56:14	Josh Norman gets his $15M/year on a 5 year deal and gets to face OBJ two times a year.

JasonLaCanfora	705091373461020673	2016-03-02T18:04:18	Flacco should seriously consider putting a Joe Linta (his agent) statue in his front lawn. NFLPA should at least name an elevator after him
JasonLaCanfora	705091125388910592	2016-03-02T18:03:18	Between the $62M Flacco earned from 2013-2015, plus his 2016  signing bonus and 2016 base salary, that's $106M folks. Holy. Bleep.

JasonLaCanfora	704830786843844609	2016-03-02T00:48:49	Mason Crosby's deal makes him the second kicker to average $4M/season. Justin Tucker will eventually be joining that group as well I suspect
JasonLaCanfora	704824198649085952	2016-03-02T00:22:38	Mason Crosby's deal with GB is 4 years, $16.1M with $5M to sign. Has shown ability to thrive in the elements there. Smart move to keep him

JasonLaCanfora	704805352018153472	2016-03-01T23:07:45	NFLCapAnalytics no, it is actually impossible seeing him get $36M anywhere. Even on a long-term deal
JasonLaCanfora	704805208237408257	2016-03-01T23:07:10	NFLCapAnalytics there is no discount. No one was giving him $18M. He is injury prone, ranked in bottom 20 percent in most metrics.
JasonLaCanfora	704804720100048896	2016-03-01T23:05:14	NFLCapAnalytics took less than what? Whatever San fran might give him after it cuts Kap? This doesn't happen in a vacuum
JasonLaCanfora	704804512670871553	2016-03-01T23:04:25	NFLCapAnalytics you miss the point - the team bought long-term control of cutler. This is at most 2yrs
JasonLaCanfora	704804398753386496	2016-03-01T23:03:57	NFLCapAnalytics no it doesn't. That's not this market. no one gets that and team only gets 2yrs of control. Not even elite players get it
