MrRBourne	723815692315717640	2016-04-23T10:08:03	15. The EU is reformed or reformable. Evidence: failure of Lisbon agenda, renegotiation, slowness of TTIP, madcap proposals continue.
MrRBourne	723815048326594560	2016-04-23T10:05:30	14. EU restrains nationalist economics. Argument: offset by centralisation giving power to sectional interests: farmers, NGOs, Eurozone etc
MrRBourne	723814489523650560	2016-04-23T10:03:16	13. Regulatory level playing field gd 4 economy. Argument: harmonisation entrenches systemic risks &amp; eliminates regulatory discovery process
MrRBourne	723814089055719425	2016-04-23T10:01:41	12. EU gives Britain global influence. Argument: no homogenous EU interests on most issues. Liberal voice on WTO constrained as 1/28 of rep.
MrRBourne	723813662495006720	2016-04-23T09:59:59	11. EU a good level of govt. Argument: most public goods/spillover problems global or very local. EU very inefficient level of govt.
MrRBourne	723813219614232576	2016-04-23T09:58:14	10. 3 million jobs depend on EU membership. Argument: Individuals trade, not govts. Contra Soubry, trade continues post Brexit.
MrRBourne	723812731913121792	2016-04-23T09:56:17	9. Brexiteers must have detailed plan. Argument: Leave campaign won't negotiate exit. Many disagree. Much will be decided democratically.
MrRBourne	723812322926563328	2016-04-23T09:54:40	8. That what other govts say now will be how they treat us post-Brexit. Argument: once leave, trade mutually beneficial still. Econ wins.

MrRBourne	723811658913701888	2016-04-23T09:52:01	7. Treasury study was robust. Evidence: assumed away everything Brexiteers want on trade, migration, regulation. Assumed EU stays same!
MrRBourne	723810596043534336	2016-04-23T09:47:48	6. We need as 'good a deal' with EU. Evidence: non-EU trade will be more important going forward. Logically, gains here will be &gt; EU losses.
MrRBourne	723810099819646976	2016-04-23T09:45:50	5. Brexiteers are 'isolationist'. Evidence: just look at political philosophy of almost any leading campaigners and intellectuals.
MrRBourne	723809676379455489	2016-04-23T09:44:09	eschizas they want to harmonise more employment law. No good can come of that for UK
MrRBourne	723809546272161792	2016-04-23T09:43:38	4. EU is good for FTAs. Evidence: no deals with US, Japan, China. Switzerland has more. Iceland-China. Coordination problem w 28 EU states.
MrRBourne	723808618873782273	2016-04-23T09:39:57	3. No economist supports Brexit and no pro-Brexit studies. Evidence: Bootle, Lyons, Minford, CEBR, Open Europe, Capital Economics, IEA.
MrRBourne	723808229998923776	2016-04-23T09:38:24	2. The EU lowers prices. Evidence: erm, it's a customs union. Manufacturing/ag prices ~ 20% above world prices. Add on expensive energy.
MrRBourne	723807902759268352	2016-04-23T09:37:06	EU Debate Myths: 1. The EU good for jobs. Evidence: unemployment rates in Greece and Spain; Norway/Swiss outside. Domestic policy rules, ok.

MrRBourne	693905991247732736	2016-01-31T21:17:35	4) Can't see strategic aim of throwing weight against Cruz in this state...unless they really think whole season is run-off of him vs Trump.
