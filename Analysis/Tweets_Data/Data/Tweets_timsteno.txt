timsteno	723620178253193216	2016-04-22T21:11:09	RealBenGilbert mekosoff Uber won't have to own up to anything! Companies, esp private ones, aren't held accountable for that kind of thing
timsteno	723615046987862016	2016-04-22T20:50:45	mekosoff yep! Exactly.
timsteno	723614982454296578	2016-04-22T20:50:30	mekosoff oh of course it was! But that was meant to show that people could “make a living” driving for Uber, right?
timsteno	723614829819375616	2016-04-22T20:49:54	mekosoff or uber could go as low as it has to in order to cut Lyft at the knees. Sort of like Amazon did with Quidsi
timsteno	723614471277678592	2016-04-22T20:48:28	mekosoff these companies will go as low as drivers will tolerate to get people to use the services more and more
timsteno	723614373390999552	2016-04-22T20:48:05	mekosoff interesting! Though Uber used to tout “our drivers make $80k per year” stat so I think it’s just to grab market share.
timsteno	723602988376461312	2016-04-22T20:02:50	timsteno and the Uber/Lyft price wars that mean cheaper rides for us (yay!) mean less and less money for drivers (bad!)
