gubbmintcheese	722422262263980033	2016-04-19T13:51:03	lynn0p exactly..
gubbmintcheese	722421523479404544	2016-04-19T13:48:07	So question becomes: what happens first? Does the recovery kick in and hit escape velocity, or do the negative consequences blow wide open?
gubbmintcheese	722420986876792832	2016-04-19T13:45:59	Economies haven't benefitted as much as is needed for a recovery.. but negative unintended consequences HAVE grown... and grown globally.
gubbmintcheese	722420624014970880	2016-04-19T13:44:33	Fed is convinced there is a wealth effect that will kick in at some point. So the policy has been to  keep pushing stocks higher.
gubbmintcheese	722420317101031424	2016-04-19T13:43:20	So if nothing is supporting stock prices... traditional "fundamentals" don't work. The gap between the economy &amp; market is getting wider.
gubbmintcheese	722419677155098624	2016-04-19T13:40:47	Greenspan confirmed yesterday that it's not gdp.. not oil.. not eps.. not jobs.. not wages. Not AHE... not a recovery. It's the Fed.
