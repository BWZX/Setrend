notsalome	725120643784663041	2016-04-27T00:33:28	I don't think the Oystacher defense is crazy: the CFTC has refused to define terms to give it leeway in enforcement.
notsalome	725120093684944896	2016-04-27T00:31:17	This is a deliberate strategy! The CFTC has not defined terms in the CEA.

notsalome	725064020168986624	2016-04-26T20:48:28	I think it's because they know an individual would fight the case and challenge jurisdiction - and win.
notsalome	725063879437484032	2016-04-26T20:47:54	Note that while DOJ and FCA have charged individuals in those cases, the CFTC has not brought any individual cases.
notsalome	725063737774858242	2016-04-26T20:47:20	The LIBOR, FX, and ISDAFIX settlements just include a footnote that CFTC has jurisdiction and no bank wants to litigate it. But WTF?
notsalome	725063516126859264	2016-04-26T20:46:27	Also I'll care about when someone starts challenging the CFTC's jurisdiction over reference rates. I don't think they have jurisdiction.
notsalome	725062494235058176	2016-04-26T20:42:24	Basically the only thing I care about in derivatives anymore is the development of CFTC manipulation case law under 4c(a)(5).

notsalome	719918814675222528	2016-04-12T16:03:15	pnuts_mama parva_x I was set on rescuing but we submitted 6-7 of these long applications just to be told the pup was already adopted 😫
notsalome	719917929370886144	2016-04-12T15:59:44	parva_x pnuts_mama here it's like they lost the dog, get an adopter, then transport the dog. didn't realize it was like that
notsalome	719917773896445952	2016-04-12T15:59:07	parva_x pnuts_mama yes! at least on LI some of the shelters pro-actively rescue dogs from the south so they are available in NY
notsalome	719917431205072898	2016-04-12T15:57:45	pnuts_mama we've been going to shelters every weekend up here and either the puppies are already on hold/adopted or pit mixes :/

notsalome	719914152572108800	2016-04-12T15:44:43	pnuts_mama oh wow, didn't realize that about the pyrs - maybe we should wait for the breeders we spoke to (berner, newfie)
notsalome	719913797025210368	2016-04-12T15:43:19	pnuts_mama good point! minnie looks like mostly great pyr - we like the gentle giants bc of the weather up here too

notsalome	719509604917501952	2016-04-11T12:57:12	So sure, we're playing the tiniest violin for these kids but how can anyone blame them for leaving? For saying, "there has to be more."
notsalome	719509393063178240	2016-04-11T12:56:21	Why a comfortable apartment, preferably close to the office? Because that's the only place you have time to go and damn you work hard.
notsalome	719509230378725378	2016-04-11T12:55:43	No time for hobbies, or family. And your paycheck goes to the exorbitant rent you have to pay to live in a comfortable apartment.
notsalome	719508968993894400	2016-04-11T12:54:40	You can argue that juniors are paid to compensate for this, and the pay is GREAT. BUT THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE! No time for anything else.

notsalome	719506755382853632	2016-04-11T12:45:52	Is there some innate good in corporate busy-work that we feel the need to so feverishly defend? Of course there's not! Quit, millennials!
notsalome	719506431066710016	2016-04-11T12:44:35	Buried in these why millennials quit articles: why do we think anyone should spend months drafting useless PowerPoint presentations?

notsalome	719505110024470529	2016-04-11T12:39:20	Some of the generational shift is societal: there isn't such a stigma if you leave a safe job to try something new.
notsalome	719504072097841153	2016-04-11T12:35:13	There's no "winning" the corporate game: it's hustling until the day you die. And very few people are purely motivated by that.
notsalome	719503785077420034	2016-04-11T12:34:04	One of the biggest, most life-changing revelations I had was that IT NEVER ENDS. There's always a new client, new business to bring in.

notsalome	717712479531438080	2016-04-06T13:56:04	And then it would be up to the banks/FRB/OCC to get into compliance. The path to compliance would be very different for each bank.

notsalome	713862253850796032	2016-03-26T22:56:38	franklinshepard it really is though. finding that people friends with journalists/writers more likely to use real name!

notsalome	713856442890104832	2016-03-26T22:33:33	CarsonSieving I remember having that realization too in law school and quickly made up a pseudonym haha
notsalome	713854342814638080	2016-03-26T22:25:12	For the record, I wasn't implying anyone *should* use their real name. I was curious what others who considered it thought about it.
notsalome	713852226087882753	2016-03-26T22:16:48	cate_long that's a good point- I was wondering about boring a potential law audience with garden/birds/cats, and vice versa.

notsalome	713849801419407361	2016-03-26T22:07:10	I have been thinking about the benefits of targeted identities, similar to business names. Is one online identity too broad?
notsalome	713849453170581504	2016-03-26T22:05:46	I never thought *I* would ask this, but besides work, why do you (or don't you) use your real name on Twitter?

notsalome	699207976880463872	2016-02-15T12:25:47	notsalome typical male senators let their emotions get the best of them.

notsalome	699208247337689088	2016-02-15T12:26:51	Obama should appoint Diane Wood. With the support of Posner/Easterbrook behind her, how much of an opposition could the GOP muster?
notsalome	699187854967246848	2016-02-15T11:05:49	All of that said, I would be thrilled with a Justice Easterbrook. He should have been appointed over Alito/Roberts tbqh.
notsalome	699187400766005248	2016-02-15T11:04:01	The greatest irony yet would be if Trump is elected and nominates a very pro-business but socially liberal SCOTUS Justice like...POSNER!
notsalome	699180256826146816	2016-02-15T10:35:38	Unsurprisingly, it just shows McConnell is not very good at game theory.
notsalome	699180130686627840	2016-02-15T10:35:07	I don't see how a blanket refusal to do the Senate's constitutional duty makes GOP Senators come out ahead under any scenario.
notsalome	699179804550103040	2016-02-15T10:33:50	Plus, if a Democrat is elected in 2016, doesn't this "principled opposition" force the GOP to approve *any* Clinton/Sanders nominee?
notsalome	699179509036273664	2016-02-15T10:32:39	This would have pushed Obama to nominate a more moderate replacement, whom the GOP could have still opposed based on Kagan/Sotomayor legacy.
notsalome	699178528017874944	2016-02-15T10:28:45	The GOP seriously miscalculated preemptively stating President Obama "shouldn't" nominate a new SCOTUS Justice. Why not just wait &amp; Bork?

notsalome	698639697216741376	2016-02-13T22:47:38	I regret to inform President Obama that I will not be available to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Apologies.

notsalome	698637864385519616	2016-02-13T22:40:21	conorsen if Obama floated a moderate appeals court judge that really wasn't offensive, R leadership may prefer that to waiting
notsalome	698637599410405376	2016-02-13T22:39:18	conorsen I'm not sure. It's a big October term for both sides and 4-4 decisions are chaotic. Could depend on the R primary or names floated
notsalome	698636498569187332	2016-02-13T22:34:55	The Seventh Circuit is the single most impressive bench in the country, including SCOTUS.
notsalome	698636187297259521	2016-02-13T22:33:41	Since President Obama already appointed two very young Justices, would age still stand in the way of Diane Wood?

notsalome	698616021196935170	2016-02-13T21:13:33	MikeIsaac parva_x it's crazy bc we're never actually making noise, our next door neighbors thought our apt was empty! olds
notsalome	698615081567916036	2016-02-13T21:09:49	parva_x MikeIsaac that's what I said! filing a false police report is a crime. we worried she'd go extra crazy during eviction tho
notsalome	698614358318788608	2016-02-13T21:06:57	MikeIsaac parva_x she's old and manic, I think she's on drugs (and the police did too). the building is evicting her but it takes a while
notsalome	698614141381169152	2016-02-13T21:06:05	ICYMI: we are still moving to NH (house closing next week!), but are temporarily moving to a new apt in NYC.

notsalome	698613086626975744	2016-02-13T21:01:54	parva_x MikeIsaac she called the cops at 3pm during the blizzard and wouldn't tell them until they got there that it was about NOISE.
notsalome	698612901117083648	2016-02-13T21:01:09	parva_x MikeIsaac yeah everyone tried explaining that noise travels and it might not be us but she thinks we're doing it intentionally?
notsalome	698612565035872257	2016-02-13T20:59:49	MikeIsaac parva_x but it got to the point where I was afraid we'd come home and one of the cats would be boiling 😬
notsalome	698612434651738112	2016-02-13T20:59:18	MikeIsaac parva_x she's insane- she complained every day when we were in NH and the apartment was empty. the cops just apologize to us
notsalome	698612291110051845	2016-02-13T20:58:44	MikeIsaac parva_x she constantly complained to the building and when they "wouldn't do anything" (BC THERE IS NO NOISE) she called cops

notsalome	698611700031995904	2016-02-13T20:56:23	parva_x it would have cost us a ton to break this lease so we kind of lucked out with miss crazy downstairs anyway- new apt much cheaper
notsalome	698611396595093506	2016-02-13T20:55:11	parva_x yep! our NH closing is 2/29. I'm aiming to leave work in another month or two-we'll start bringing things up and ordering furniture

notsalome	698609230404833280	2016-02-13T20:46:34	parva_x erniebufflo so the building is moving us for free and letting us shorten the lease. we'll be splitting time NYC/NH
notsalome	698608854934953984	2016-02-13T20:45:05	parva_x erniebufflo yeah she has complained for months about dogs barking and babies crying in our place. clearly a disturbed person
