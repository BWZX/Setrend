TheArmoTrader	714652442764267520	2016-03-29T03:16:34	FlyByKnite Ugh, Byron deserved that.
TheArmoTrader	714651240127266816	2016-03-29T03:11:47	brosales12 Seems like so. Madsen an example. Kinda hoping he stays. Want to see how he "develops" under a good coach.
TheArmoTrader	714650126115950592	2016-03-29T03:07:22	brosales12 I actually think they should look to keep Thomas Scott (Byron's son). Young guys have said good things about him +good "gesture"

TheArmoTrader	714648334686769154	2016-03-29T03:00:15	FlyByKnite Yeah, my view going into the draft was "at worst, a Tony Allen". Yikes, might not even be that.
TheArmoTrader	714648218596806656	2016-03-29T02:59:47	FlyByKnite Also, what's nuts is Marcus' low % in the paint. 45.5% this year. 47.5% last year. He was ELITE in college.
TheArmoTrader	714647892535877634	2016-03-29T02:58:29	FlyByKnite People forget that defense in basketball, as undervalued as it is, is still secondary to offense.
TheArmoTrader	714647510355083264	2016-03-29T02:56:58	Byron Scott deserves to have the record for the worst loss by a Laker team. Not D'Antoni.

TheArmoTrader	714304435489378304	2016-03-28T04:13:43	CTKwasniewski slayinmaven And again, looking at the FA list, there are some interesting/worthy guys, but it's such an overrated "tool".

TheArmoTrader	714302447972327424	2016-03-28T04:05:49	LifeOfABruin I think in-season performance probably should weigh more than tourney result (see your boy Tony Bennett for ex.), like 75/25.
TheArmoTrader	714300969689821184	2016-03-28T03:59:56	LifeOfABruin So, I know you think the roster is pretty flawed...but your expectation is a F4? How does that work?
TheArmoTrader	714300001996787712	2016-03-28T03:56:06	LifeOfABruin Before the season we should set an expectation meter. Then visit it after the season.

TheArmoTrader	714298517217366016	2016-03-28T03:50:12	LifeOfABruin Oh I am. I didn't want him fired last summer even tho I knew this was coming. Even for Lakers, that's a bad look.

TheArmoTrader	713485047521787905	2016-03-25T21:57:45	colezwicker jzmazlish Reason I brought him up was b/c there's currently a weird dropoff between elite SFs (Kawhis, KDs) and next tier.

TheArmoTrader	713266820703080449	2016-03-25T07:30:36	KajSkyhook33 But you're right. He is a project. I wouldn't expect him to be a normal contributor until his 3rd year. He's so young.
TheArmoTrader	713266641547603968	2016-03-25T07:29:53	KajSkyhook33 Yep. What I take away from watching him is that he needs strength+experience &amp; a lot of his weaknesses will be mitigated

TheArmoTrader	713183580273246208	2016-03-25T01:59:50	BillMonty_ samesfandiari Rough ceiling comps: Hield=Redick, Brown=Derozan, Poeltl=Bogut, Valentine=D. Green, Dunn=Conley, etc etc
TheArmoTrader	713182824589697024	2016-03-25T01:56:50	BillMonty_ samesfandiari Like all the other guys b/w 4-30 have such a low(er) ceiling, that if u miss out,you're not dooming ur franchise
TheArmoTrader	713182487896166400	2016-03-25T01:55:30	BillMonty_ samesfandiari Meant IQ on D. I don't like some of his decisions on that side.
TheArmoTrader	713182336532123648	2016-03-25T01:54:53	samesfandiari he mentioned 86 celtics in the latest pod fyi...surprise!
TheArmoTrader	713182231536074752	2016-03-25T01:54:28	BillMonty_ samesfandiari That's exactly why Bender at 3 makes sense. Reward is SOO high compared to alternatives.
TheArmoTrader	713181689690722304	2016-03-25T01:52:19	BillMonty_ samesfandiari Simmons potential on D worries me. He might be average at best. Not long,poor IQ,doesnt give effort=Huge red flag
TheArmoTrader	713180947798056960	2016-03-25T01:49:22	BillMonty_ samesfandiari Lol. I'm hoping Bender gets more PT in the final +9 games. Would give me confidence to put DB at #2.
TheArmoTrader	713180450445918208	2016-03-25T01:47:24	BillMonty_ samesfandiari Personally, I might take Bender at 2 over Simmons (ingram is 1). He's that freakin' intriguing.
TheArmoTrader	713180024224911360	2016-03-25T01:45:42	Lol Nets beat the Cavs? Well, now that puts both the Suns &amp; Nets @ 20. No way do the Lakers win 5 of 11 (that wld just tie them). TanksOver
TheArmoTrader	713178191301488640	2016-03-25T01:38:25	samesfandiari 7ft dude who can bring the ball up,plays hard,shoots 3s,can protect rim somewhat. Strength main issue but should come w/ time
TheArmoTrader	713178005854523392	2016-03-25T01:37:41	samesfandiari It's cuz he's on a very good team &amp; he's barely 19 lol. Yeah, lack of shown production is a risk but 1 I'd b willing to take

TheArmoTrader	713175361920471041	2016-03-25T01:27:11	GoJoeBruinUCLA sideoutpar Duke is more acceptable than UNC from a Bruin standpoint bc of the whole "shitting on the Wear twins+ LD2" thing
TheArmoTrader	713173847776755712	2016-03-25T01:21:10	samesfandiari He has a SHIT ton of potential pretty much. Think Gallo with better defense. Or Draymond Green pretty much. Point fwd w/ D.

TheArmoTrader	713106363719680000	2016-03-24T20:53:00	samesfandiari Didnt mean dumb loss is lolzy. Meant if dumb loss keeps you guys from 72 or 73.

TheArmoTrader	712865789251084288	2016-03-24T04:57:03	JacobRude Bender/Simmons real close. Former has SO much potential, but little production. Latter OK potential, lots of production.
TheArmoTrader	712865104610664448	2016-03-24T04:54:19	afa_brain brosales12 JacobRude Depends on who #1 is lol. My 1-2-3 I think will eventually be Ingram-Bender-Simmons.

TheArmoTrader	712863399017885696	2016-03-24T04:47:33	HerbieVerstinks That'd suck, but they'd take Simmons which is great cuz I rly am not crazy over BS. This is assuming we land 2 or 3.
TheArmoTrader	712862516267847680	2016-03-24T04:44:02	brosales12 JacobRude I have a feeling Jackson's gonna have a Shabazz/Jaylen Brown/Stan Johnson-esque disappointing season FWIW.
TheArmoTrader	712861485568012288	2016-03-24T04:39:57	JacobRude brosales12 Jacob, think of it like this. We lose the pick, we're taking Lonzo Ball (or OG Anunoby) next year. Decent tradeoff
TheArmoTrader	712861212095168513	2016-03-24T04:38:51	HerbieVerstinks Gamblers fallacy. 50/50 is 50/50 (well, it's 57/43 here, so even better), doesn't matter what the historical results are.

TheArmoTrader	712826626061377537	2016-03-24T02:21:25	ericjackson It's fine tho. We lose the pick,we're getting a lotto pick in a stronger draft in '17. Essentially '16 1-3 should equal '17 4-7
TheArmoTrader	712825999327518720	2016-03-24T02:18:56	ericjackson Yep, pretty much a coin flip. Hey, I'll take it. Thought it'd be at 25-30% going into the season.

TheArmoTrader	712823748877897728	2016-03-24T02:10:00	brosales12 This is good for #32. More 1st round bubble prospects mean the better chance the prospects we discussed fall to us.

TheArmoTrader	712458828952961024	2016-03-23T01:59:56	FlyByKnite There was one (openish) 3 in the game where it looked so smooth. Then another (open) 3 were it looked bad,clanked off backboard.
TheArmoTrader	712458531799044096	2016-03-23T01:58:45	FlyByKnite I hate that he doesn't play full games and/or meaningful mins. I get it, I just hate it. He plays hard too, love that.
TheArmoTrader	712457779261247489	2016-03-23T01:55:46	FlyByKnite I think I have Bender 2, w/ BI @ 1. But I was watching a DB game from Dec,loved this @ the end:  2:04:10
TheArmoTrader	712429991057707008	2016-03-23T00:05:20	jzmazlish I dunno. Like what can go wrong if Hield ends up in Sacramento?

TheArmoTrader	712395087682994176	2016-03-22T21:46:39	FlyByKnite samesfandiari Related: Simmons told Senior gaurd Buddy to "come out (for the draft)" and not stay in school. Lol.
TheArmoTrader	712394802885595137	2016-03-22T21:45:31	FlyByKnite samesfandiari I was SURE that was Simmons who said that. Damnit.

TheArmoTrader	712353580091441154	2016-03-22T19:01:43	RyanKelapire HerbieVerstinks JustRyCole Exactly. You think that's easy or sustainable for a non-east coast program? Nope.

TheArmoTrader	712332976466448384	2016-03-22T17:39:50	RyanKelapire mattvazin cuz like 15 people live there
TheArmoTrader	712331686759915521	2016-03-22T17:34:43	mattvazin Yep. And from my experience it moved slower.
TheArmoTrader	712330386592780288	2016-03-22T17:29:33	mattvazin Yeah its pretty damn good. But the price point (+ lines) makes it less attractive for frequent trips.

TheArmoTrader	712184301161349120	2016-03-22T07:49:03	garykester JackTheRealist7 BTW my top 3 guys (in order): Khris Middleton, Jae Crowder (&amp; one late 1st), DeAndre Jordan.
TheArmoTrader	712183889087717377	2016-03-22T07:47:25	JackTheRealist7 garykester Noel's a more sure thing and fits the Lakers current core pretty well. Love Bender but I think I'd do that.

TheArmoTrader	712168200146845697	2016-03-22T06:45:05	Juicemanji JacobRude grantgoldberg The NBA's still the NBA and the Lakers are still the Lakers. Guys don't coach for "job security" IMO
TheArmoTrader	712167725536161792	2016-03-22T06:43:11	JacobRude grantgoldberg Rather go assistant route if we we're to go risky. Smart guys out there, just gotta find 'em.
TheArmoTrader	712167581193412608	2016-03-22T06:42:37	grantgoldberg JacobRude I shy away from college coaches (Stevens is a HUGE exception). College game's way different than the NBA.
TheArmoTrader	712165138837549056	2016-03-22T06:32:55	JacobRude Brooks seemed very simplistic in his pod w/ Lowe. But he'd be OK. Thought Joerger would be let go but no way after last few weeks
TheArmoTrader	712164680257523712	2016-03-22T06:31:05	JacobRude grantgoldberg Easily. I think after him, it's a jumbled (but decent) mess. Might lean Blatt honestly.

TheArmoTrader	712146613414678528	2016-03-22T05:19:18	Yep, this was great. Gives you insight on how someone can support either (esp. Trump) guy. 
TheArmoTrader	712146467188637696	2016-03-22T05:18:43	colezwicker Ohhoo, tough guy, eh? Next thing you're gonna say is a 6'7 guy can play center and a PG can launch 35 footers w/ no issue huh?
TheArmoTrader	712145582572183553	2016-03-22T05:15:12	colezwicker whereas Hield is gonna be asked to guard (or be matched up with) the Clarksons, Oladipos, even McCollums. Easier task I think.
TheArmoTrader	712145328766455808	2016-03-22T05:14:12	colezwicker No, he could. It's just with him, he's gonna be asked to guard tougher players. Gonna be asked to gaurd PG13s, Kawhis, etc
TheArmoTrader	712143899490275328	2016-03-22T05:08:31	colezwicker Yep. Think Buddy can become decent defensively once he's put into the "Redick Role". He has such a heavy onus offensively at OU
TheArmoTrader	712143005826703360	2016-03-22T05:04:58	colezwicker You'd think so (&amp; I bet you Pelton's model doesn't like Hield due to "regressioning") but he's done it w/ increasing vol./focus
TheArmoTrader	712142266995908613	2016-03-22T05:02:02	colezwicker It's real close for me. Love both guys. Theoretically I should have DV &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BH but mentally I cant pull that trigger.
TheArmoTrader	712141717042909184	2016-03-22T04:59:50	colezwicker  This season does seem '14/15 Korver-esque tho. Like, he's so far from his mean. He's still an all-timer tho.
TheArmoTrader	712140383002566658	2016-03-22T04:54:32	colezwicker he's a sick worker as we know so getting a "Redick" is huge for a team. Think NO, SAC (RIP), TOR, MIL will be interested in BH
TheArmoTrader	712139814951202816	2016-03-22T04:52:17	colezwicker I agree he doesnt have Curry/Allen ceiling...but he's probably somewhere between Meeks &amp; Redick for now.
TheArmoTrader	712139440496320516	2016-03-22T04:50:48	colezwicker Yep. I'm looking @ Hield comps &amp; there you have it. Curry/Allen/JJ/Dame...then Douby/Harvey/Christmas  
TheArmoTrader	712138940652716032	2016-03-22T04:48:49	colezwicker That is true about his shooting. TS% &amp; eFG% would be 5th. 2nd in 3P% only behind Slow-mo (LOL...yeah yeah volume I know).
TheArmoTrader	712137612417323009	2016-03-22T04:43:32	colezwicker R. White, Slow-Mo, Turner, Hassell, Luke, Salmons,Vasquez....See a theme? Well-rounded role players. Is that Denzel's ceiling?
TheArmoTrader	712137459602034688	2016-03-22T04:42:55	colezwicker Denzel makes sense, but his avg athleticism worries me. Look at this list and look at the NBA wings

TheArmoTrader	711350603054600194	2016-03-20T00:36:14	Gibberman10 JonathanTjarks I was thinking more along the lines of the wing version of Kyle Anderson.
TheArmoTrader	711347412585943040	2016-03-20T00:23:34	HerbieVerstinks if he was constantly getting to elite 8s finals 4s then ok. But has never been past sweet 16 yet
TheArmoTrader	711338630111858688	2016-03-19T23:48:40	C_OrlandoMusic It's possible he's nothing special, sure. But he wasn't being maximized at Kentucky (surprise surprise)

TheArmoTrader	711335031759736833	2016-03-19T23:34:22	Hey Skal Labissiere, enter the draft and don't look back. You too, Tyler Ulis.  Someone will take Skal in the 1st, Tyler has a shot too.

TheArmoTrader	711333138920681472	2016-03-19T23:26:50	thejonlee It's possible, but panams such a smaller (and older) sample. But yeah, that's why I think he's good value in the 8-14 range.
TheArmoTrader	711332175400964097	2016-03-19T23:23:01	thejonlee Ya, as I said here  might be the role he's forced to play...but still, risk is there he's a chucker guard

TheArmoTrader	711329261588615172	2016-03-19T23:11:26	Mojo_palacios WagnerSBranco Ya,maybe it's his current role forcing him into the way he plays, &amp; maybe it changes in NBA, but not a big fan
TheArmoTrader	711328232495157248	2016-03-19T23:07:21	Jamal Murray reminds me a little of Lou Williams, in the way he approaches the offensive end. To stuck on trying to score every time.

TheArmoTrader	711317566413615104	2016-03-19T22:24:58	samesfandiari Kinda yeah. But again, his value really comes out on a better team when he's asked to be in a role. LA needs more impact guys
TheArmoTrader	711316067319033856	2016-03-19T22:19:00	samesfandiari  1) Not sure he's good as Bogut 2) Bogut's value really comes out on a good team. When you dont have one, how valuable is he?

TheArmoTrader	711313223773851648	2016-03-19T22:07:42	samesfandiari REGGIES_WORLD I think that's exactly where his stock is. 25-40 range. But LAL has better needs to address than backup PG
TheArmoTrader	711312128288751616	2016-03-19T22:03:21	REGGIES_WORLD samesfandiari I was just thinking this too. What a perfect fit
TheArmoTrader	711308958959411200	2016-03-19T21:50:45	RyanKelapire he's really good, but how translatable is that? He's not gonna be as ball-controling in the NBA.
TheArmoTrader	711308301158330368	2016-03-19T21:48:09	FlyByKnite RyanKelapire Same feeling here. He doesn't do anything outstanding (like IT2's scoring) but does a lot of things well.

TheArmoTrader	710685917384544257	2016-03-18T04:35:01	Matthew_Tynan I was looking for latest kpelton article the other day,had to scroll back on his TL to find link,nowhere on ESPN NBA page
TheArmoTrader	710683019728715776	2016-03-18T04:23:30	HerbieVerstinks what's his motive tho.

TheArmoTrader	710678058638782464	2016-03-18T04:03:47	So, Arizona, USC, and Colorado end up with as many tournament wins as UCLA. JustSaying
TheArmoTrader	710677526666805248	2016-03-18T04:01:40	WOWOWOW
TheArmoTrader	710677351311417344	2016-03-18T04:00:58	DavidSchawel What? Arrow is a horrible rule. I could live w/ 30, but they really need to push 3pt line back a little.
TheArmoTrader	710677010004074496	2016-03-18T03:59:37	Abolish the possession arrow, move the 3-point line a little back, and drop the shot clock to 28 seconds. MakeCollegeBallGreatAgain
TheArmoTrader	710675280247934977	2016-03-18T03:52:45	garykester IMO you guys match up better w/ Providence. USC has shooting and athleticism.
TheArmoTrader	710674494206021632	2016-03-18T03:49:37	DavidSchawel Madness, in March.
TheArmoTrader	710672682564460544	2016-03-18T03:42:25	LifeOfABruin Two bad defenses?
TheArmoTrader	710672046632505344	2016-03-18T03:39:54	Wow, Providence-USC is a fun game. On TBS. 5:55 left, Prov. is up by 1.
TheArmoTrader	710670122898169856	2016-03-18T03:32:15	JustRyCole welcome to NCAA basketball

TheArmoTrader	710665231693787136	2016-03-18T03:12:49	insomniacslounj hope he enjoyed that few year hiatus in which UCLA didn't land the top CA prospects. 
TheArmoTrader	710651963445129216	2016-03-18T02:20:06	LakerGMC brosales12 eh, you can't know that now. So pull off the best move you could and deal w/ consequences later
TheArmoTrader	710651281287688192	2016-03-18T02:17:23	LakerGMC brosales12 Yeah, but hey, if you're "dumping" Batum for Westbrook, you do it, lol
TheArmoTrader	710649534494277633	2016-03-18T02:10:26	RyanKelapire JacobRude They ARE?
TheArmoTrader	710649157988397057	2016-03-18T02:08:57	JacobRude I mean, WSU is gonna "upset" Arizona so I'd be sweaty too
TheArmoTrader	710649010487320576	2016-03-18T02:08:21	LakerGMC brosales12 I'm just saying it's gonna be super easy to move guys in '17 summer. 2nd cap jump+teams who miss out on this summer.
TheArmoTrader	710648723789848576	2016-03-18T02:07:13	brosales12 LakerGMC IIRC, you can get there if you dump Lou, stretch/dump Young, and Bass opts out (and trade/lose pick I guess).
TheArmoTrader	710647891845521408	2016-03-18T02:03:55	LakerGMC brosales12  +teams the space to absorb Parson's contract (which will be around 27M). 2nd cap jump gives a lot of leeway.
TheArmoTrader	710647830340177926	2016-03-18T02:03:40	LakerGMC brosales12 Don't even think you'll even need the stretch option. Cap goes from 90 to 108. That by itself will give a lot of+
TheArmoTrader	710646747123490816	2016-03-18T01:59:22	LakerGMC Again, there's gonna be so much cap room, someone will happily take on those quality guys for @ worst free barring disaster injury
TheArmoTrader	710646418411618306	2016-03-18T01:58:03	LakerGMC So a guy like Batum will just cost like 20% more the following summer (BTW, looking at 2017 wings &amp; YIKES, best name=Redick,Iggy)
TheArmoTrader	710645790742437888	2016-03-18T01:55:34	LakerGMC Of course they could, but we're right back at that dumbass deadline thing again. BTW, don't forget 2nd cap jump in '17 too
TheArmoTrader	710645184665505793	2016-03-18T01:53:09	LakerGMC I wouldn't mind that team at all. Especially since dumping guys will be so easy. More assets for LAL.
TheArmoTrader	710644611346083840	2016-03-18T01:50:53	LakerGMC DAR/Batum/Parsons/Randle/Whiteside with JC off the bench and potentially a top pick is a playoff team. 6-8 but payoffs IMO.
TheArmoTrader	710643945429032960	2016-03-18T01:48:14	LakerGMC Huh. Those are the best free-agents after KD. You definitely want 3 of those guys if you can get 'em.
TheArmoTrader	710643296024993792	2016-03-18T01:45:39	LakerGMC True, but remember, that dumbass deadline. Jim might be pressured into getting some more quality guys.
TheArmoTrader	710643138847580160	2016-03-18T01:45:02	LakerGMC I don't think so.  Why would guys like Bazemore, Batum, Mahinmi, Whiteside, Parsons wait for KD? $ is out there.
TheArmoTrader	710642333696430080	2016-03-18T01:41:50	LakerGMC Don't have to be max guys. Could be 3 high quality, 1 mid-tier players. I'm sure LAL prefers EBR w/ JC.
TheArmoTrader	710642091232112640	2016-03-18T01:40:52	LakerGMC As for KD, I'm not sure he'll have his decision by 7/5. That's pretty early. LBJ waited until Jul 12 to decide 2 years ago.
TheArmoTrader	710641515660378112	2016-03-18T01:38:35	LakerGMC No but that's the thing, I assume they wanna (will?) use early bird rights to sign JC, and not cap space.
TheArmoTrader	710639665284382720	2016-03-18T01:31:13	LakerGMC  +will agree to deals quicker, since they can sign them quicker. Before, they wouldve had 12 days to decide since no rush to sign.
TheArmoTrader	710639537718824960	2016-03-18T01:30:43	LakerGMC  1) Clarkson offer by another team now can come v. early 2) If they do the whole "Wait for KD to decide thing", other FAs+
TheArmoTrader	710639439043698688	2016-03-18T01:30:19	garykester It's a 1-16, you dont have to worry, like I said.  Now after this, ya, go nuts, worry as much as you want.
TheArmoTrader	710638870224891904	2016-03-18T01:28:04	garykester You were saying?
TheArmoTrader	710638754545831938	2016-03-18T01:27:36	LakerGMC bad for LAL IMO

TheArmoTrader	710550443726778368	2016-03-17T19:36:41	colezwicker Daniel? I could see him go early-mid 2nd round this year. I mean, prospects ~ #40-100 not that different.
TheArmoTrader	710549935809138688	2016-03-17T19:34:40	colezwicker Him and Isaac (UCLA, similar ish game) just seem so not athletic. Tho Daniel has better prospects due to height
TheArmoTrader	710549631340453889	2016-03-17T19:33:28	JustRyCole he's the youngest
TheArmoTrader	710549545852149760	2016-03-17T19:33:07	JustRyCole Yeah. 1 year younger than Isaac

TheArmoTrader	710366170679889920	2016-03-17T07:24:27	JacobRude AnthonyIrwinLA ...but then you get into rim-protection issues big time.
TheArmoTrader	710365957567287297	2016-03-17T07:23:36	aaaaahronen Nobody's denying he's talented. People have issue w/ his potential NBA fit and how his weaknesses will affect him.
TheArmoTrader	710365642751258624	2016-03-17T07:22:21	NazzerLim AnthonyIrwinLA JacobRude It's not nitpicking. This is a serious issue.1 that the team has to consider when weighing risk/reward
TheArmoTrader	710365397501943808	2016-03-17T07:21:23	AnthonyIrwinLA JacobRude Hmm, I'm certain "Ben Simmons" isn't how you spell "Brandon Ingram".
TheArmoTrader	710364595790094336	2016-03-17T07:18:12	JacobRude AnthonyIrwinLA It's possible. But right now, this is all we can go on. I'm just getting a very Okafor-esque vibe w/ him.
TheArmoTrader	710363944985071616	2016-03-17T07:15:37	AnthonyIrwinLA JacobRude Yeah, and in the NBA, with smarter defenses, and stronger/better athlethes, I worry
TheArmoTrader	710363810616385536	2016-03-17T07:15:05	AnthonyIrwinLA JacobRude +to some extent. Pero Antic is a perfect example,dude was a bad 3P shooter! But he still shot &amp; made guys contest
TheArmoTrader	710363634833043457	2016-03-17T07:14:23	AnthonyIrwinLA JacobRude Problem with non-shooters is that you dont put pressure on defenses to account for shots. As a bad shooter,you do
TheArmoTrader	710363409590583297	2016-03-17T07:13:29	AnthonyIrwinLA JacobRude This is true. But once you have teams realize, "Oh, just play free-safety when this guy is outside" ---&gt;bad.
TheArmoTrader	710363218724585472	2016-03-17T07:12:43	JacobRude AnthonyIrwinLA Lol, his like one jump shot of his LSU career?
TheArmoTrader	710362735951745025	2016-03-17T07:10:48	JacobRude AnthonyIrwinLA DX's latest breakdown also had examples. And I always see it too. I HATE non-shooters.
TheArmoTrader	710362483307913220	2016-03-17T07:09:48	JacobRude AnthonyIrwinLA He's Rondo man. He doesn't look to shoot when he should. 
TheArmoTrader	710361520161497088	2016-03-17T07:05:58	JacobRude AnthonyIrwinLA Problem with Simmons isn't that he's MKG-like (tho his shot isn't perfect). Problem is he's Rondo.
TheArmoTrader	710361396387549184	2016-03-17T07:05:29	JacobRude AnthonyIrwinLA I mean, it's gotten better but he's still far from being an average shooter.
TheArmoTrader	710360668713537536	2016-03-17T07:02:35	JacobRude AnthonyIrwinLA MKG fixed his jumper?

TheArmoTrader	710343169989185536	2016-03-17T05:53:03	RyanKelapire He's worth a flier IMO. Yeah, Dudley isn't perfect but he'd be a nice veteran piece that can help the young guys.
TheArmoTrader	710342624398344192	2016-03-17T05:50:53	RyanKelapire I like Biyombo, Zeller, Dedmon as C options (think latter 2 dont get qualifying offers). Hairston, Lance Thomas, Dudley for SF
TheArmoTrader	710340598138425344	2016-03-17T05:42:50	RyanKelapire Bazemore is this year's Middleton. He's not a lower level FA anymore. Mahinmi also gonna get paid as well. Other 2 are eh.
TheArmoTrader	710340410640470020	2016-03-17T05:42:06	Juicemanji I just wished his team played him more. A lot of his stock his so much potential
TheArmoTrader	710339583997677572	2016-03-17T05:38:48	Juicemanji btw he turned 18 in November
TheArmoTrader	710339431568281600	2016-03-17T05:38:12	Juicemanji I might take him over Simmons at 2.
TheArmoTrader	710329305037836289	2016-03-17T04:57:58	RyanKelapire aggh, urgh. Going w/ latter
TheArmoTrader	710320242593890304	2016-03-17T04:21:57	JuiceLogan 30 games isn't that big of a sample. It should definitely be weighed more than HS stuff, but still not a lot of info.
TheArmoTrader	710316918373126144	2016-03-17T04:08:45	gotvatch Big men just in general take a while to get going, especially if they are young. Look @ Biyombo. Looks like a legit starting C now
TheArmoTrader	710316387651035136	2016-03-17T04:06:38	JuiceLogan Lance is another one that fits this bill, tho not to the degree of DAJ.  Again, it's pretty rare. But payoff can be big.
TheArmoTrader	710315350290616320	2016-03-17T04:02:31	JuiceLogan Like, if Skal fell out of the 1st, and was there for the taking at 32 for the Lakers, I'd be pissed if they passed up on him
TheArmoTrader	710314862073634817	2016-03-17T04:00:34	JuiceLogan Yeah, I mean, it's not always the case. 9.5/10 youre not gonna get a player like him. But the 0.5 it works, payoff is huge.
TheArmoTrader	710314682674876416	2016-03-17T03:59:52	gotvatch Yeah, it took, what? 4 year until he become a contributer.
TheArmoTrader	710314171934486528	2016-03-17T03:57:50	FlyByKnite gotta give refs props for consistency at least

TheArmoTrader	709194219009609728	2016-03-14T01:47:32	Craigbball  Maybe! But as of now, I think KP maybe ends up being the 2nd most valuable player due to what he may do at C (rim protect/3s).

TheArmoTrader	709192016698052608	2016-03-14T01:38:47	HerbieVerstinks Yep, I think so. Hopefully the vets can pull this one through.
TheArmoTrader	709191941045354499	2016-03-14T01:38:29	JustRyCole Craigbball So ya I think I'd go KAT, KP, DAR, Booker, Turner, Winslow, Jahlil, WCS, Portis, Mudiay

TheArmoTrader	709191170388131840	2016-03-14T01:35:25	JustRyCole Craigbball I think KP's positional importance still makes him 2nd. But DAR's recent play has made the original gap much smaller

TheArmoTrader	708740065271238656	2016-03-12T19:42:53	samesfandiari I'd warn you on going to old w/ roster. What did the '11 Lakers in. Old/tired feet. No youth. Tho your core is p young.

TheArmoTrader	708513772315389952	2016-03-12T04:43:41	LifeOfABruin JustRyCole Think he'll get to 6'2 at least, given that Lonzo and Liangelo are 6'5. He's young but early start gives him advtg
TheArmoTrader	708513125092368384	2016-03-12T04:41:07	JustRyCole he might end up the best one, which is nuts to say b/c Lonzo's a likely lotto pick

TheArmoTrader	708403506709798912	2016-03-11T21:25:32	BillMonty_ NBADraftWass especially given the asset/talent-overlap issues I stated. I think it's close, hence my preference for BI.

TheArmoTrader	708401339777339392	2016-03-11T21:16:55	NBADraftWass That's why I think Ingram has more support for #1 despite your original statement. Fit's an issue, given BS isn't LBJ/AD type.
TheArmoTrader	708400885471191042	2016-03-11T21:15:07	NBADraftWass Yeah (I'd trade Okafor). For LA, they might be forced to trade Randle.

TheArmoTrader	708082956389195776	2016-03-11T00:11:47	HerbieVerstinks Yeah I agree. What's funny is that all the PGs SA missed in his first "year" (aka 2 months) of recruiting are all mediocre.
TheArmoTrader	708081367188443136	2016-03-11T00:05:28	HerbieVerstinks Steve Nash = Bryce Alford too.  Jim Buss = Dan Guerrro.   Can't believe I didn't see this before.
TheArmoTrader	708081001365377024	2016-03-11T00:04:00	HerbieVerstinks Fans heard the names Shaka Smart and Brad Stevens. So disappointed when SA hired. It makes 100% sense.
TheArmoTrader	708080796997951488	2016-03-11T00:03:12	HerbieVerstinks People heard the name Phil Jackson so they got hyped, and rightfully so. So disappointed when MDA hired.

TheArmoTrader	708010277036396544	2016-03-10T19:22:58	JustRyCole It's still basketball. Say he wants to work on right hand floaters. Better to experiment at SL for 2-3 games then not at all.
TheArmoTrader	708008558403563520	2016-03-10T19:16:09	JustRyCole Doesn't need =/= cant be beneficial.  He doesnt need to play 30MPG in SL. Plus, a good way to further build/add chemistry.
TheArmoTrader	708007786047614976	2016-03-10T19:13:04	JustRyCole Eh, I can see DAR using SL to expirement on some stuff. JC maybe wont even be under contract during SL + doesnt need it.

TheArmoTrader	707360053875986432	2016-03-09T00:19:13	hmfaigen Remember when we freaked out when he was picked 27th.
TheArmoTrader	707352543056101376	2016-03-08T23:49:22	johnschuhmann Brandon Bass!  Dude's just so solid. Makes sense both WRT "on" positivity and negating "off" negativity.
TheArmoTrader	707339543717023744	2016-03-08T22:57:43	If Kasich were to somehow get the nomination, it's compulsory that every professional political pundit immediately resign.
TheArmoTrader	707329857483476992	2016-03-08T22:19:14	colezwicker Yep he's really smart. And this is also partly due to the increasing chemistry he's building with Clarkson.
TheArmoTrader	707306838161645568	2016-03-08T20:47:46	garykester It took the Vikings (be it Zimmer, the OC, Teddy, and/or AP) about ~3/4ths of the season to figure it out a balance FWIW
TheArmoTrader	707306131467579392	2016-03-08T20:44:57	garykester This is true,but a tricky thing when gaining a great RB-as I witnessed last year-is now the gameplan changes,huge balancing act
TheArmoTrader	707298051388379136	2016-03-08T20:12:51	JoshEberley JustRyCole 110 3PAs....If he were to qualify* for 3P%, he'd rank 29/37.   (*Must be on pace for 82 3P FG made.)
TheArmoTrader	707289256767594496	2016-03-08T19:37:54	samesfandiari JustRyCole Yep but I have no idea which star would be on the market besides Cousins.
TheArmoTrader	707287647459213312	2016-03-08T19:31:30	samesfandiari JustRyCole Yeah this is more ideal. Bring in Baze/Mahinmi/Dudley type of quality guys and bank on youth. '18 FA=huge
TheArmoTrader	707287242461458432	2016-03-08T19:29:54	samesfandiari JustRyCole Yeah I think they're a year away from that. Trade is possible but only involving Randle/pick if kept.
TheArmoTrader	707285577771524096	2016-03-08T19:23:17	JustRyCole samesfandiari You can always trade 1 of the young guys later a la Wiggins. No need to go all in before you see your hand
TheArmoTrader	707282762227519489	2016-03-08T19:12:05	samesfandiari JustRyCole I don't get this. Why trade 1 of the young guys?
TheArmoTrader	707282230712766464	2016-03-08T19:09:59	JustRyCole easily latter
TheArmoTrader	707282144259743745	2016-03-08T19:09:38	samesfandiari JustRyCole Bazemore? Mahinmi?
TheArmoTrader	707102233393954817	2016-03-08T07:14:44	mattbilinsky Close enough. Lead guard.
TheArmoTrader	707100778037510144	2016-03-08T07:08:57	LifeOfABruin Nah thats impossible TP will be gone.

TheArmoTrader	707098920933961728	2016-03-08T07:01:34	LifeOfABruin 247 has him split odds b/w UA/KU/MSU. You read something I didnt see
TheArmoTrader	707098093116739584	2016-03-08T06:58:17	LifeOfABruin Yeah maybe it might not matter. If you have tools/skills to play, only mental aspect left.
TheArmoTrader	707097716807970817	2016-03-08T06:56:47	Mike_Schmitz Something even crazier: Aaron Gordon is 17 months older than Josh Jackson.  Will be a 4 years pro when JJ is a rookie.   WHAT

TheArmoTrader	707074266424938497	2016-03-08T05:23:36	KamBrothers The only issue I have with this is that we're so close to the end. Wish this came much earlier. But alas.... (I agree w/ u)

TheArmoTrader	707071483206508544	2016-03-08T05:12:33	brosales12 That's why Ulis is so interesting. He's killing it in the SEC, which has NBA and pro-level players.
TheArmoTrader	707070457745264641	2016-03-08T05:08:28	brosales12 If he was in a Major conference doing this, that wouldve given me more confidence. But in the Horizon....
TheArmoTrader	707069054448570368	2016-03-08T05:02:53	brosales12 His 3P% also not amazingly great (FT% is solid tho) that you can be comfy thinking he'll be a shooter (Tho tbf, IT2's was worse)

TheArmoTrader	707044382612951040	2016-03-08T03:24:51	brosales12 Yep. I wonder is Boston willing to sell #48 or #52. Think 1 of Fedler/Ulis/Paige/Barber/Wallace there is a good investment.
TheArmoTrader	707043707707482114	2016-03-08T03:22:10	brosales12 Felder/(one of Onuaku/Hammons/Brogdon)/Ingram would be my dream scenario.

TheArmoTrader	706855061935104000	2016-03-07T14:52:34	DewNO ...and someone on the right would say the opposite. That's the reality man. You're free to choose to ignore it.
TheArmoTrader	706854071546679296	2016-03-07T14:48:38	DewNO JonathanTjarks But that's my exact point. Not arguing what's right or wrong. Arguing about ability to "get shit done"/pragmatism.
TheArmoTrader	706853548915433472	2016-03-07T14:46:33	KellyScaletta And that makes him too unworkable when it comes to governing.
TheArmoTrader	706853513117048833	2016-03-07T14:46:24	KellyScaletta Again go back to the string of tweets that I linked to.  Issue isn't he's right or wrong. It's that his views are too left.
TheArmoTrader	706851795771916288	2016-03-07T14:39:35	TJFsports FWIW we all doubted the pick, was just funny I was browsing old tweets from draft day  
TheArmoTrader	706850972744556544	2016-03-07T14:36:19	KellyScaletta Except....having arms isn't a "disqualifier" to governing. Whereas having an ideology far from the middle is.
TheArmoTrader	706768055645306880	2016-03-07T09:06:50	DewNO ok then who decides which ideologies are worse and which are better?
TheArmoTrader	706763022849568768	2016-03-07T08:46:50	KellyScaletta How can you support Sanders (who is ideological) &amp; not be a hypocrite if u despise those that support ideological republicans

TheArmoTrader	706706463524139009	2016-03-07T05:02:05	colezwicker Yeah about. Danny Green seems the closest but Valentine is a better playmaker. Iggy too athletic for comp.
TheArmoTrader	706697905503997957	2016-03-07T04:28:05	ryangsoares I dont see how. He's gonna go like 8-20, not good enough for our 1st rounder, not bad enough for our 2nd rounder
TheArmoTrader	706689524940689412	2016-03-07T03:54:47	ryangsoares He might be better than Sacre,but that's not the issue @ hand here. Its him making an impact when he's given chance. IE - Black
TheArmoTrader	706689261907488769	2016-03-07T03:53:44	ryangsoares IF he's healthy, I dont think he falls to 32. If he isn't, then makes it a dicey gamble.
TheArmoTrader	706688299545423872	2016-03-07T03:49:54	ryangsoares We dont have anything to lose. He does. If he comes in, isn't ready (he's not), chances of getting 2nd chance is slim.
TheArmoTrader	706687696442241024	2016-03-07T03:47:31	ryangsoares He's ~2 years younger than Hammons, so if in a year or 2 he's ready, he's got a long career ahead of him.
TheArmoTrader	706686632796168194	2016-03-07T03:43:17	ryangsoares Like him too, but at #32, would go w/ a different route. Would love to buy a pick in the 40s to pick him

TheArmoTrader	706670573171027968	2016-03-07T02:39:28	daothermike Depends, but yeah, we can ALMOST get there w/ trading some guys + not keeping/trading pick.
TheArmoTrader	706669523387027456	2016-03-07T02:35:18	daothermike Maybe something like Middleton for say #3 pick? Or Top #2 pick +Randle for Marc Gasol if Conley leaves? Dunno, real abstract rn
TheArmoTrader	706668694991036416	2016-03-07T02:32:00	daothermike Yeah, that's a tough one. Cousins obvious name. But maybe 2 really solid guys? Doubt IND wants to trade PG.

TheArmoTrader	706633872419614720	2016-03-07T00:13:38	brosales12 That sounds reasonable, yeah.  Any of our top3 guys, I'd be super happy with.
TheArmoTrader	706631982432694272	2016-03-07T00:06:07	KevinOConnorNBA JonathanTjarks Gibberman10 I think it was the whole lacking a likely star(s) thing that gave it a bad stench.
TheArmoTrader	706631301395140608	2016-03-07T00:03:25	brosales12  I think mine is Onuaku&gt;Brogdon &gt;Hammons&gt;Newman&gt;LeVert w/ the last 2 being pretty fluid between GP2, Finney-Smith, and Morris.
TheArmoTrader	706631187444297728	2016-03-07T00:02:58	brosales12 We didnt talk about this, but what's your top-5 rank preference for #32? (1/2)
TheArmoTrader	706630814755237889	2016-03-07T00:01:29	Dloading Great win guys
TheArmoTrader	706621641925603329	2016-03-06T23:25:02	Suns win so the gap between them and the Lakers stays the same. Tank race unaffected and Lakers get the biggest upset in NBA history. Sweet.
TheArmoTrader	706620755765649408	2016-03-06T23:21:31	brosales12 That sequence so tanktastic.

TheArmoTrader	706615786425561089	2016-03-06T23:01:46	brosales12 The 5 active rookies did great ;)
TheArmoTrader	706614918804410368	2016-03-06T22:58:19	The Lakers join the Nuggets as the only team to have beaten the Champion 2014-15 Warriors and the 70-win bound 2015-16 Warriors.

TheArmoTrader	706611626812637186	2016-03-06T22:45:14	THIS IS GREAT.
TheArmoTrader	706610975558934530	2016-03-06T22:42:39	D'Angelo Russell should be closing this game over Huertas, even tho the latter is a big reason why LA is winning.  Development &gt; Wins.
TheArmoTrader	706610795417718785	2016-03-06T22:41:56	Shaqk311 I dont think this game affects our tank race that much
TheArmoTrader	706610613179408384	2016-03-06T22:41:13	brosales12 Hopefully he's gonna check in for Young or Huertas here....but why do I feel like that's not likely?
TheArmoTrader	706610060454027265	2016-03-06T22:39:01	Lakers over Warriors would be the biggest upset in the NBA this season, according to FiveThirtyEight. Warriors were 17 point favorites.

TheArmoTrader	706606439943397378	2016-03-06T22:24:38	The LA bartender who got the Warriors wasted last night deserves a pair of signed Kobe shoes if the Lakers win this.

TheArmoTrader	706596753349300224	2016-03-06T21:46:08	JacobRude JustRyCole Yep. And it's not like one of those double whammys like it would be against PHX (they get L, we get W).
TheArmoTrader	706596121351565312	2016-03-06T21:43:37	jordanbrianl Nice. He's certainly one of the 5 guys I want with LAL's high 2nd round pick. (cc: brosales12)
TheArmoTrader	706595617527562240	2016-03-06T21:41:37	Reminder: This game is literally the best &amp; worst team ever (+50 games in) playing each other. LA is up by 11 @ HT.

TheArmoTrader	706587759650086912	2016-03-06T21:10:24	iggypop120 Although if it was Jokic, LAL probably comes out better, I think.
TheArmoTrader	706587574895140864	2016-03-06T21:09:40	iggypop120 Yeah, I think that's right. But what if they had, say, Dinwidie rated higher? Or Robinson? etc. Just wouldve taken 1 guy (1/2)
TheArmoTrader	706586796839215104	2016-03-06T21:06:34	Curry and company are SHOOK. Being in the same building as Kobe Bryant does that to teams. Can't say I'm surprised. 
TheArmoTrader	706586481092001792	2016-03-06T21:05:19	mattvazin What a cocky punk. Reacting positively to your teammate's success? Wow. He needs to be sent to the locker room for that.
TheArmoTrader	706585158808244224	2016-03-06T21:00:04	Interesting what-if about Clarkson: If the Lakers had their original 2nd rounder (at #36), would they have taken him there or someone else?
TheArmoTrader	706582196388122624	2016-03-06T20:48:17	jordanbrianl dude, we always get food from Sipan haha. They're pretty good.
TheArmoTrader	706580512228245508	2016-03-06T20:41:36	jordanbrianl Interesting. Don't think I've had an olive/mushroom one. Usually just cheese/spinach/potato.

TheArmoTrader	706579389945769984	2016-03-06T20:37:08	jordanbrianl Nice. What type of Beorek is it? Just plain cheese?  Make sure you squeeze some lemon onto the lahmajune.
TheArmoTrader	706219950688575493	2016-03-05T20:48:51	I had an extended discussion with TheArmoTrader at LakersSBN about the Lakers' options at #32. Give it a gander: 
TheArmoTrader	706556086933827584	2016-03-06T19:04:32	Kabobs are better than both.  
TheArmoTrader	706552665002496000	2016-03-06T18:50:57	adamcarstens woah, California is actually going to matter in an election? Crazy.
TheArmoTrader	706550922978066432	2016-03-06T18:44:01	mattbilinsky FWIW, Horford's and Millsap's rim protection s: 49 and 50% respectively....50% is about the NBA average.
TheArmoTrader	706549820920434688	2016-03-06T18:39:39	FlyByKnite who's the last major NBA star to go out on top? David Robinson?

TheArmoTrader	706393837074149377	2016-03-06T08:19:49	hmfaigen Niceee. Is that the 1948 trophy? Or the 1950? 1952? 1953? 1954? 1972? 1980? 1982? 1985? 1987? 1988? 2000? 2001? 2002? 2009? 2010?
TheArmoTrader	706392840029384704	2016-03-06T08:15:51	hmfaigen Yeah, that's one of the appeals. Especially since its in the facility where LAL practices at. It's cool being there.
TheArmoTrader	706391921598435328	2016-03-06T08:12:12	hmfaigen  1) Cool, I've been itching to go to one. 2) Del Harris was a good/underrated coach. 3) Why are we talking in numbers?

TheArmoTrader	706356460351979520	2016-03-06T05:51:18	samesfandiari mattbilinsky Hes not THAT young,but not old either. Shld b a good contributor &amp; will get better w/experience. $12M is my max
TheArmoTrader	706356147104526336	2016-03-06T05:50:03	samesfandiari mattbilinsky Yeah, I'm not disagreeing with this! Heck, I saw this when he was with LA 
TheArmoTrader	706354638908293120	2016-03-06T05:44:04	LifeOfABruin MichaelMHanna And see, if he has a whatever year with that talent next year (barring some situations), I'll be on your side
TheArmoTrader	706354187148263424	2016-03-06T05:42:16	MichaelMHanna FireAlford crowd should be happy he didnt get another extension tonight ;)
TheArmoTrader	706353531020640256	2016-03-06T05:39:39	MichaelMHanna I know lots disagree, but this is the right move.
TheArmoTrader	706353003125575681	2016-03-06T05:37:34	mattbilinsky He's good, like top-20 ish good. Dont think he's top-10.   Think complaint w/ KB is he goes under screens a lot.
TheArmoTrader	706351048823181313	2016-03-06T05:29:48	mattbilinsky Again, I go to the team effort/Budenholzer thing. Millsap + Horford + Baze + Thabo + Teague/Korver/Schroder being OK=#2 D
TheArmoTrader	706350155193159682	2016-03-06T05:26:15	Misha Tate just beat Holly Holm? Am I seeing that right?
TheArmoTrader	706349805136535552	2016-03-06T05:24:51	mattbilinsky Millsap &amp; Horford are probably top-10 defenders at their positions.  And Thabo is legit as well. Teague/Korver OK. Team effort
TheArmoTrader	706348595864207360	2016-03-06T05:20:03	xchuyx3 mattbilinsky I'll still pay him $10-$12M to come back to LA. Something like $35M/3 years.
TheArmoTrader	706348048947871749	2016-03-06T05:17:52	LifeOfABruin Of course I care. But I dont think the answer is what you think the answer is.
TheArmoTrader	706347854403497984	2016-03-06T05:17:06	mattbilinsky I dont think so. He's pretty good, but probably not top 10. FWIW:

TheArmoTrader	706278056072077312	2016-03-06T00:39:45	LifeOfABruin Yeah that's possible. Or maybe Kasich so they try to take Ohio instead

TheArmoTrader	706224416292630528	2016-03-05T21:06:36	daothermike Yep, but even besides that. Scouts tear you apart more the longer you stay, regardless of school.
TheArmoTrader	706224009763954688	2016-03-05T21:04:59	LifeOfABruin Yeah, we might need to call up someone now.

TheArmoTrader	706223423207309312	2016-03-05T21:02:39	JuiceLogan Yep that's why, in 9.5/10 cases, I think guys should almost always go pro. Risk of falling is &gt;&gt;&gt; than reward of rising.
TheArmoTrader	706222090341355520	2016-03-05T20:57:21	Always cool to see a 5* guy like Alex Poythress stay 4years in school,but 1 cant help to think if he wouldve been better if he left after 1.

TheArmoTrader	706208650570784768	2016-03-05T20:03:57	rafael_uehara Here's the issue. Lots of teams prefer to have  James Joneses,World Peaces at end of bench instead of Beasleys,Jakars,Quincys
TheArmoTrader	706206978859663360	2016-03-05T19:57:19	samesfandiari Missed this. I'm still not sure what u mean. P obvious he's not those guys but he'll be a huge upgrade which fans will enjoy
TheArmoTrader	706206256281706496	2016-03-05T19:54:26	rafael_uehara Believe LAL gave him a workout last year and elected not to sign him. Telling.  Maybe a BBIQ thing rather than tools thing?
TheArmoTrader	706205753455955968	2016-03-05T19:52:26	LakerGMC OK so he misses record for perfect FT game, but he technically holds the record for most consecutive FTs made in a 1 game, right?
TheArmoTrader	706205553467400193	2016-03-05T19:51:39	brosales12 Might be the new haircut
TheArmoTrader	706205258997846016	2016-03-05T19:50:29	brosales12 Yeah, and not just, "he made an open dunk".

TheArmoTrader	705980343619223552	2016-03-05T04:56:45	afa_brain LakerGMC Yeah, 2 more wins before we get another W and I think we'll have some nice distance b/w us.
TheArmoTrader	705980178803994624	2016-03-05T04:56:05	samesfandiari huh
TheArmoTrader	705979945529421824	2016-03-05T04:55:10	LakerGMC We need 6 wins in 19 games to catch them at their current total. We have 12 in 62. It's not happening, lol.

TheArmoTrader	705975541422170112	2016-03-05T04:37:40	rafael_uehara I've heard a poor mans Draymond (on D) for him. That's pretty good for a bench guy.
TheArmoTrader	705971391871393792	2016-03-05T04:21:10	rafael_uehara Yeah, his potential on D is interesting.

TheArmoTrader	705882356586971137	2016-03-04T22:27:23	88mugsy88 Yeah, Lowe was breaking some news there I think
TheArmoTrader	705877379420262400	2016-03-04T22:07:36	88mugsy88 Yeah, MN approached MIL about swapping Rubio for Middleton. MIL countered with MCW for Rubio. Both sides said no.
TheArmoTrader	705875518449541120	2016-03-04T22:00:12	88mugsy88 Well, this was food timing from Lowe.

TheArmoTrader	705847105911332864	2016-03-04T20:07:18	88mugsy88 Yeah, It makes sense to give LaVine a go at PG during development seasons, but to annoint him as some great player there,is funny
TheArmoTrader	705846490665603073	2016-03-04T20:04:52	88mugsy88 he's good on D &amp; he makes others better. I can see the no shooting thing being annoying,but the former 2 skills are so beneficial
TheArmoTrader	705844490347491330	2016-03-04T19:56:55	88mugsy88 That's pretty funny (re: Lavine at PG), because the stats say the opposite. He's much better at SG.

TheArmoTrader	705651860422590464	2016-03-04T07:11:28	brosales12 JacobRude Yeah, it's not great. That's why I'm really hoping for Ingram (be it, at 2 or 1). Makes it all so easy.
TheArmoTrader	705650889655058432	2016-03-04T07:07:37	JacobRude brosales12 But yeah, I let a smart coach try to work it. Maybe get a stretch 5 and stagger a bunch?
TheArmoTrader	705650739331207169	2016-03-04T07:07:01	JacobRude brosales12 Yeah,I'm on this train as well. If Randle's value decreases  (say, late '17 1st) b/c Simmons is soooo good, so be it.

TheArmoTrader	705472947213828096	2016-03-03T19:20:32	I can't believe we still have to deal with Trump for another 8 months. This is getting tiring.
TheArmoTrader	705422447294734336	2016-03-03T15:59:52	Sad. Aubrey witnessed Steph's shot on Saturday night (in between Curry and Roberson) 
TheArmoTrader	705305399306506240	2016-03-03T08:14:45	SherwoodStrauss brendan__22 Luc Richard Mbah Moute if he had a much better offensive game.  Lives for Orebs/putbacks.
TheArmoTrader	705277855047913472	2016-03-03T06:25:18	brosales12 Oh yeah. Maybe a promise like a big training camp payday, or like an open 15th roster spot does the trick.
TheArmoTrader	705277205807378432	2016-03-03T06:22:43	brosales12 But even if guy goes overseas, you still own NBA rights. Could call him back/sign next season if he really stands out.
TheArmoTrader	705276402430406656	2016-03-03T06:19:32	brosales12 Chris_Reichert Oh for sure. It'd be a guy you think had a chance+liked/needed. And would have an understanding with.
TheArmoTrader	705275419616894976	2016-03-03T06:15:38	Chris_Reichert Say for example, I'd love it if LAL bought like #52 from BOS, and "draft&amp;stashed a PG (IE- Kay Felder,Paige,Barber,Wallace)
TheArmoTrader	705274156900724737	2016-03-03T06:10:37	Chris_Reichert This was good.  I'm curious to see if more and more teams will use late 2nds as "draft and stash" DL options.
TheArmoTrader	705272296039026688	2016-03-03T06:03:13	FlyByKnite Thank you!
TheArmoTrader	705272115637780480	2016-03-03T06:02:30	FlyByKnite Hey Justin, do you know where (If?) I can find data on how much/often a player holds the ball for?
TheArmoTrader	705269543891922946	2016-03-03T05:52:17	FlyByKnite well, if he was worried about the foul there....
TheArmoTrader	705267815272415233	2016-03-03T05:45:25	LifeOfABruin Nothing drastic has changed, so I'll let you take a guess.
TheArmoTrader	705267605087526914	2016-03-03T05:44:34	@KDrewLamar blssblog DAR's shot is a little low,but so far, it looks like it hasn't been an issue per that chart. And nothing close to SM's
TheArmoTrader	705264759822680072	2016-03-03T05:33:16	LifeOfABruin Probably should extend Alford.

TheArmoTrader	705264275548303360	2016-03-03T05:31:21	This is not a perfect stat, but helps dispel the notion that Dloading would get his shot blocked in the NBA.

TheArmoTrader	705170513983881216	2016-03-02T23:18:46	brosales12 basquiatball Huh. Realgm has his agents as these 2 guys, who are listed under Octagon.

TheArmoTrader	704813990648500224	2016-03-01T23:42:04	nanexllc No, I get it. It's not good. But I think some see it more as "teenager stealing a candy bar" rather than "Bank being robbed".

TheArmoTrader	704763566096691200	2016-03-01T20:21:42	BillMonty_ afa_brain AnthonyIrwinLA If they were guaranteed choices, I'd go with #3, but not for the reason dparks24 just listed

TheArmoTrader	704758768723070978	2016-03-01T20:02:38	afa_brain AnthonyIrwinLA Nope. Nor do they play the Nets again. Have a couple of weak teams, but brutal schedule overall.
TheArmoTrader	704757816540565504	2016-03-01T19:58:51	AnthonyIrwinLA afa_brain I dunno, staying at 2nd is pretty huge. Means we can fall 1 spot and still keep pick.

TheArmoTrader	704755716276355072	2016-03-01T19:50:31	AnthonyIrwinLA We'd have to go 7-14 (LOL) the rest of the way just to catch up to their *current* win total if we lose tonight.
TheArmoTrader	704755477763088385	2016-03-01T19:49:34	AnthonyIrwinLA Still need to lose. We lose tonight, thus handing the Nets a W, practically eliminates them from the tank race for #2.
TheArmoTrader	704754613438668801	2016-03-01T19:46:08	AnthonyIrwinLA And the other one is only allowed to play when Kobe gets DNPs. Oh, and another one didnt play 4Qs until now.

TheArmoTrader	703801307883155457	2016-02-28T04:38:02	Wait. This HAPPENED????  
TheArmoTrader	703798521795772416	2016-02-28T04:26:58	So...I hear I'm missing a great game?
TheArmoTrader	703757466417233920	2016-02-28T01:43:49	brosales12 yeah, I dont know how he wasn't on my and some draft board radars until recently.
TheArmoTrader	703757112191496192	2016-02-28T01:42:25	brosales12 Yep, have it on, but gonna miss most of this game unfortunately.
TheArmoTrader	703750030012739584	2016-02-28T01:14:16	TJFsports Bernie is done. Hillary has this.
TheArmoTrader	703748457345908736	2016-02-28T01:08:01	tyjpaul I just don't get the anti-Alford-ism right now. If you're not a fan, sure, I get that.  But outright hate on him,that's on the fans
TheArmoTrader	703748172615553027	2016-02-28T01:06:54	tyjpaul Next year is a huge litmus test. He has experience, depth, upside, and his past coaching mistakes to work on.  If he fails, then OK
TheArmoTrader	703747995594981377	2016-02-28T01:06:11	tyjpaul Like I said, he's not completely blameless. Should've had a couple of diff recruits. But that doesnt change grand scheme of things
TheArmoTrader	703747663825543168	2016-02-28T01:04:52	tyjpaul I didn't realize we had a senior Kyle Anderson, J. Adams, etc. Issue was he had a bunch of guys leave his program to NBA/graduation
TheArmoTrader	703746314064908288	2016-02-28T00:59:30	tyjpaul That's SUCH a bad way to looks at things. Holy crap. Like, no context AT ALL.
TheArmoTrader	703745773758840832	2016-02-28T00:57:22	tyjpaul Right. Remember when Coach K got stubborn &amp; never recruited one-and-dones?  Or Popovich sticking w/ grit&amp;grind,not adapting to 3s.
TheArmoTrader	703745083833606144	2016-02-28T00:54:37	tyjpaul Lol, Nah. That's just a weird question. Best coaches don't have 1 identity. They are malleable.
TheArmoTrader	703742751943176192	2016-02-28T00:45:21	tyjpaul Sam_Vecenie What's this question even mean?
TheArmoTrader	703742153273380864	2016-02-28T00:42:58	Sam_Vecenie tyjpaul 3/ Next yr is the HUGE litmus test. Can he use his past mistakes,w/ a base finally built, to win/build momo. We'll see
TheArmoTrader	703741685088407552	2016-02-28T00:41:07	Sam_Vecenie tyjpaul 2/ Is he completely blameless? No. There's some coaching improvements he could've done, &amp; had some recruiting hiccups.
TheArmoTrader	703741549809545216	2016-02-28T00:40:35	Sam_Vecenie tyjpaul 1/ This should've been Alford's 1st year, theoretically. It was a weird situation he was thrown in.
TheArmoTrader	703737442348576768	2016-02-28T00:24:15	jordanbrianl Ha. But I don't disagree with the Anderson &gt; Brogdon &gt; Joe *Harris* (who was actually traded to+waived by ORL) view.
TheArmoTrader	703736668172345344	2016-02-28T00:21:11	adamcarstens Let's do this!
TheArmoTrader	703736117317636096	2016-02-28T00:18:59	jordanbrianl If he can shoot (looks like he could), and be a slightly positive on the defensive end, he has a *role* in the NBA.
TheArmoTrader	703735598767419392	2016-02-28T00:16:56	jordanbrianl Yeah, he doesn't seem like the fastest guy. But that's why he won't be a 1st round pick (+ age). 2nd round very likely IMO.
TheArmoTrader	703733485819678721	2016-02-28T00:08:32	jordanbrianl Brogdon....watching him, and there's lots to like. Smart player. Can shoot. Decent D. Has piqued my interest.
TheArmoTrader	703730363248476160	2016-02-27T23:56:07	CanyonDriver brosales12 Lee, in his younger days, was much more explosive. Dont know if Brogdon has that in him.
TheArmoTrader	703730238342111232	2016-02-27T23:55:38	TJFsports Oh man. Ohhhhh man.
TheArmoTrader	703729925803499520	2016-02-27T23:54:23	brosales12 CanyonDriver I wouldn't expect him to be more than your team's 4th wing, but that's a great 4th wing to have.
TheArmoTrader	703728930474201089	2016-02-27T23:50:26	brosales12 Yep. Wish we had a later 2nd, so we could take a guy like him and have his NBA rights while he was on our DL team.
TheArmoTrader	703727661084909569	2016-02-27T23:45:23	brosales12 Reminds me a bit of Alan Anderson.

TheArmoTrader	703717688137240576	2016-02-27T23:05:45	slayinmaven ...and lots more. But also on the flipside, lots of flamed out guys.  But good thing is he matches "mold" of those guys.
TheArmoTrader	703717532163674113	2016-02-27T23:05:08	slayinmaven Me too. Been looking at parallels for him, these guys come up: Barnes, Danny Green, Bazemore, T. Prince. J Johnson, A. Anderson
TheArmoTrader	703715895634317312	2016-02-27T22:58:38	brosales12 CTKwasniewski Yep, why he's in heavy consideration for me still. But not the clear cut.
TheArmoTrader	703715490770780160	2016-02-27T22:57:02	CTKwasniewski brosales12 Him and Oden would be going head to head as the best lob+defensive centers in the NBA right now :(

TheArmoTrader	703714796873515009	2016-02-27T22:54:16	CTKwasniewski Funny thing: When Bynum was Hammons' age, he was already a 2 time champion. Whew cc: brosales12

TheArmoTrader	703452725296570368	2016-02-27T05:32:53	RyanKelapire If he wasn't so eccentric, I wouldn't mind him being our lead guard off the bench, if contract was favorable.
TheArmoTrader	703452262962581505	2016-02-27T05:31:03	So, I never drowned staying on Lance Stephenson island. He's not his '13/14 self, but he looks like a competent rotation guard.
TheArmoTrader	703451926491324416	2016-02-27T05:29:43	colezwicker Random but what do you think about Lance? He looks OK this year. Can he be that lead guard for the backup unit?
TheArmoTrader	703449777225097216	2016-02-27T05:21:11	colezwicker I didn't know you and forumbluegold were the same person :)

TheArmoTrader	703444309006163968	2016-02-27T04:59:27	dparks24 brosales12 traditionally, most PPG gets onto the teams, but voters getting smarter so hard to fully gauge right now
TheArmoTrader	703443159125139457	2016-02-27T04:54:53	mattbilinsky I mean, how on earth are you supposed to stop the 16th most offensively efficient team in the NBA tho?
TheArmoTrader	703442802982547456	2016-02-27T04:53:28	brosales12  Who you got on the 1st team right now? Towns/Staps/Okafor/Russell/Jokic? Mudiay/Turner/Booker/Winslow/X on 2nd team?
TheArmoTrader	703441599783575553	2016-02-27T04:48:41	Not_Raven Right. He has to man up. Grind it out. Push through. Score 50 PPG.  Got it Byron Scott.
TheArmoTrader	703441329485848580	2016-02-27T04:47:36	Not_Raven lololololllllllllllll
TheArmoTrader	703441163747876864	2016-02-27T04:46:57	Not_Raven Lol. No. I only bring up the lines because you keep saying he "isn't dominating".
TheArmoTrader	703441029379149824	2016-02-27T04:46:25	Not_Raven Lol. That's on his coach. He had 2 NBA players last year and lost in 1st round. Has no NCAA tourney win in his career.
TheArmoTrader	703440503690260481	2016-02-27T04:44:20	Not_Raven Yeah, in HS. But that has little to do with what we're talking here.
TheArmoTrader	703440366792380416	2016-02-27T04:43:47	Not_Raven It's not like we're talking about a guy averaging 10/5/1 or something. Dude is doing something nobody has done (since '94)
TheArmoTrader	703440126991421440	2016-02-27T04:42:50	Not_Raven This is a joke right? Lol. He's the only player in NCAA history (since '94) to average at least 19/10/5 
TheArmoTrader	703439484168249344	2016-02-27T04:40:16	Not_Raven As for "PPG", he's 38th. This is a bad argument. The leaderboard is filled with small-school gunners.
TheArmoTrader	703439318082129920	2016-02-27T04:39:37	Not_Raven  1) That's wrong. He's 6th in the nation in RPG 2) "Per game" is a bad way to measure, given different paces teams play with
TheArmoTrader	703439107871997952	2016-02-27T04:38:47	Not_Raven His D,while not great,is OK. Given how much he has to do on the offensive end,it makes a bit sense he'd be less intense on D
TheArmoTrader	703438830720798720	2016-02-27T04:37:41	Not_Raven Bro, he's shooting 75% at the rim.  What's this "not owning the pain" thing, lol.  He does have intensity issues at times.
TheArmoTrader	703438179236360192	2016-02-27T04:35:05	Not_Raven OK. Then tell me. What is Simmons, besides not taking outside shots, not doing that causing his team to underperform?
TheArmoTrader	703437918669398017	2016-02-27T04:34:03	Not_Raven That has A LOT more to do with the coaching than him.
TheArmoTrader	703437833776689152	2016-02-27T04:33:43	Not_Raven Jimmer averaged 29, but he also played in the MWC, which has inferior overall talent compared to the SEC.
TheArmoTrader	703437424597159939	2016-02-27T04:32:05	Not_Raven Dude. He's averaging 20/12/5. That's dominating. Like I said, the not-shooting thing is an issue, but you're underselling him.
TheArmoTrader	703436415225303040	2016-02-27T04:28:05	Not_Raven Nearly 20/12/5 on a 60% True Shooting % is pretty good.  His non-shot is a major issue, but he has talent and backs it up.
TheArmoTrader	703436027491254272	2016-02-27T04:26:32	Not_Raven Yeah I prefer Ingram over him, butttt, come on man. He's a TALENT. Little he cant do outside of shooting.
TheArmoTrader	703435348806795264	2016-02-27T04:23:51	FlyByKnite TJFsports Did he? Or did he just say that the game was more physical?

TheArmoTrader	703398326234980353	2016-02-27T01:56:44	billoram Only need Tarik Black out there so we can have our "Death lineup".
TheArmoTrader	703397889121234945	2016-02-27T01:54:59	samesfandiari yeah but he's not athletic
TheArmoTrader	703388410086461440	2016-02-27T01:17:19	BlondBanker Yeah, but nobody would've ever thunk it back in 2010 when it happened. Pretty crazy.  And I'd love KD but that's a fantasy atm.
TheArmoTrader	703387836108509184	2016-02-27T01:15:03	BlondBanker Thanks,I hope so too! Nobody can replace him, but I think a few young faces, as a collective, can help make up for his absence.
TheArmoTrader	703386919942492160	2016-02-27T01:11:24	BlondBanker We (kinda) are doing that! Problem is, pick was traded a few years ago, so only top 3 protected. 50/50 they keep it right now.
TheArmoTrader	703384353187848192	2016-02-27T01:01:12	AnthonyIrwinLA He would go 3-5 assuming we knew no NBA knowledge of the current rookies.  Towns/DAR/Simmons/Okafor/KP - cld see 2 or even 6
TheArmoTrader	703383996311285761	2016-02-27T00:59:47	AnthonyIrwinLA Like, in a re-draft, or like say, if this season happened last year, and that's all we knew?
TheArmoTrader	703383629066432512	2016-02-27T00:58:20	One of JonathanTjarks' themes as of late has been how important fit is, both for the team AND esp. modern NBA. DDR is neither IMO.
TheArmoTrader	703383587253407744	2016-02-27T00:58:10	DD is a talent,but I disagree. He's a bad fit &amp; a risky signing.  Wrote about this last week  
TheArmoTrader	703381486230044673	2016-02-27T00:49:49	SmoothsHoops they can cut his minutes drastically once Carroll is back. I think they like PP off the bench,so naturally need some1 to start
TheArmoTrader	703380852902797312	2016-02-27T00:47:18	SmoothsHoops Carroll. They're waiting for him to come back.

TheArmoTrader	702722705288613888	2016-02-25T05:12:03	brosales12 Anthony Peeler another guy who's senior year stats matchup with Adams, lol. Similar AST% as House in NBA tho.
TheArmoTrader	702721625607655425	2016-02-25T05:07:46	brosales12 House was legit fast in his early days. Never a playmaker tho. BTW, if you find a "Eddie House" in UDFA, that's a win.
TheArmoTrader	702720271187206144	2016-02-25T05:02:23	brosales12 Not saying they are the same, but man, the stats (esp. SR year) are similar. 
TheArmoTrader	702718916263411712	2016-02-25T04:57:00	brosales12 What is he? An athletic Eddie House?
TheArmoTrader	702713445003583488	2016-02-25T04:35:15	Sam_Vecenie Funny thing is, some of us said that going into the draft....and that's exactly what happened (Kyle going to SA).
TheArmoTrader	702712844433756160	2016-02-25T04:32:52	brosales12 Right. Or LeVert. He's another guy that can switch 1-3.
TheArmoTrader	702712237652193281	2016-02-25T04:30:27	brosales12 Like I'd love if the whole team can shoot, run, and switch. That'd be sooooo much fun.
TheArmoTrader	702712049537720320	2016-02-25T04:29:43	brosales12 1 good thing about the top-3 guys (tho, Simmons not as much),is that they are all able to switch on D to some extent. LOVE that.
TheArmoTrader	702711167966248960	2016-02-25T04:26:12	brosales12 You still on that Simmons #1 train?
TheArmoTrader	702710473129459713	2016-02-25T04:23:27	forumbluegold Yeah, they have him at 59% at PG. Lou brings up/takes care of the ball more than I like.
TheArmoTrader	702707281780060162	2016-02-25T04:10:46	jordanbrianl FWIW: There's a lack of 3&amp;D gaurds than there is big men.

TheArmoTrader	702698307496218625	2016-02-25T03:35:06	jordanbrianl Atkins never hit a 3 in college. A non-starter for the NBA. Brogdon can shoot, and if he can play D, he's got a chance.
TheArmoTrader	702697325584478208	2016-02-25T03:31:12	jordanbrianl Draftexpress has Brogdon at 35. Weak draft, think he gets taken. 41% from 3. He's decent defensively, right?
TheArmoTrader	702696493082279936	2016-02-25T03:27:54	jordanbrianl As a big man you have to do 1 of the 3 to last long: Shoot 3s, protect rim, or be able to roll/catch lobs.
TheArmoTrader	702695965539479554	2016-02-25T03:25:48	jordanbrianl He just....doesn't fit in today's NBA. Same as Tony Parker. Immobile, non-shooting, undersized center.

TheArmoTrader	702693826578636801	2016-02-25T03:17:18	brosales12 Yeah, I've read/heard some decent stuff about him. Suprisingly, despite meh draft, some interesting plausible UDFAs this year
TheArmoTrader	702693285664428032	2016-02-25T03:15:09	brosales12 Oh yeah. But guys sometimes just wanna start pro careers, wherever it may be. He prob stays but who knows.
TheArmoTrader	702692906792955907	2016-02-25T03:13:39	brosales12 Buy BOS's 58th pick from them, draft him, stick him on our DL team. If something happens, he's ours.

TheArmoTrader	702688218303504389	2016-02-25T02:55:01	dennismarta I think I'll have him around ~30 if he does declare.
TheArmoTrader	702687864505524225	2016-02-25T02:53:36	dennismarta Will he declare? This draft is weird/sucks. Lots of unknowns
TheArmoTrader	702687766513975296	2016-02-25T02:53:13	Sam_Vecenie Those last two defensive possessions were decently impressive. Bothered shot on both attempts.

TheArmoTrader	702684239318294528	2016-02-25T02:39:12	Brotha_Allan Still. Last 2 seasons at UM, he's been hurt. And if we're talking about health at such a young age+only college grind....scary

TheArmoTrader	702683334959243264	2016-02-25T02:35:36	Brotha_Allan Draftexpress has him at 34. Very possible. Injuries are a major concern.

TheArmoTrader	702377775227920384	2016-02-24T06:21:25	ArturoGalletti Yeah. He loves the PR, so he'll do anything. That's bad &amp; dangerous. More so than say RW policies that I disagree with.

TheArmoTrader	702224926724329473	2016-02-23T20:14:03	colezwicker 19Yanks23 And again, I go back to his ability to shoot and switch. Can play him at 3 if matchup is OK (IE-Galinari)
TheArmoTrader	702223783562575872	2016-02-23T20:09:31	Brotha_Allan I'd rather get a '17 pick for Lou. Think he'll have more value in summer after some teams strike out in FA.

TheArmoTrader	702222420782919680	2016-02-23T20:04:06	Brotha_Allan Not sure LAL will be willing to trade Lou at draft, barring great offer. They probably hold him to summer and move from there
TheArmoTrader	702221891000340482	2016-02-23T20:02:00	AnthonyIrwinLA You're making this difficult. Either take Bender/Brown/Dunn or trade #3 for perfect player (IE-Noel, Middleton, Crowder).
TheArmoTrader	702221104803282944	2016-02-23T19:58:52	Brotha_Allan I'd doubt it. But hwo knows. Tobias just got traded for peanuts, and broken back DoMo almost got HOU a decent 1st
TheArmoTrader	702220474713899008	2016-02-23T19:56:22	DPitt2 Sure. But people need to realize how hard it is to bounce back from that. Made a right bet, that didn't pan out.
TheArmoTrader	702220181901152257	2016-02-23T19:55:12	Brotha_Allan Eh, it's not perfect, b/c LAL loses contract control over the rookie, but Noel is pretty perfect for LAL, that it's fine.
TheArmoTrader	702216268540022784	2016-02-23T19:39:39	DPitt2 It isn't, but it's the reality. Lakers are in a rebuilding mode (due to many reasons). They need to do this properly.
TheArmoTrader	702215124702986241	2016-02-23T19:35:06	MastaRedSnappa More or less, yes.
TheArmoTrader	702214084675043330	2016-02-23T19:30:58	AnthonyIrwinLA So unless you're trading #3 for a '15 draftee,or a young vet who's locked in (Really, only Middleton, &amp; Crowder),u lose that
TheArmoTrader	702213813718781952	2016-02-23T19:29:54	AnthonyIrwinLA There's question, but there's also upside to keeping the pick, mainly contract control/young prospect.
TheArmoTrader	702213514799124480	2016-02-23T19:28:43	DPitt2 after they fire Scott, I think the next coaching hire is bound to be a good 1 (Luke,Thibs,some others). Lots of good options.

TheArmoTrader	702207387935977473	2016-02-23T19:04:22	JustRyCole I've been floating this idea: Hassan + 3 wings who can switch (Dudley, Bazemore, Lance Thomas) vs say just Batum or Barnes.
TheArmoTrader	702206661734244352	2016-02-23T19:01:29	JustRyCole With the +1 being a team option?  Yeah I'm on board with that as well. But what about just straight up 4 years, no options?
TheArmoTrader	702206413771116544	2016-02-23T19:00:30	colezwicker 19Yanks23 I hate that he plays so little. My only worry. So little production to go off of.  Kinda like Skal pre-UK. Risky.
TheArmoTrader	702206146006781952	2016-02-23T18:59:26	JustRyCole Are you giving him the 4 year max if that's what he demands?

TheArmoTrader	702051702908686336	2016-02-23T08:45:44	colezwicker 19Yanks23 Think DDR and Russ would be OK. It's him meshing with Randle and JC that has me worried.
TheArmoTrader	702049870262046720	2016-02-23T08:38:27	19Yanks23 colezwicker I hope so. DDR is good at what he does but overall think he's overrated and a bad fit for LAL.

TheArmoTrader	702047464782606340	2016-02-23T08:28:53	colezwicker But I should stop dreaming. We're gonna sign Derozan to a max and he's gonna mean revert and I'mma hate everything again.
TheArmoTrader	702046863717871616	2016-02-23T08:26:30	colezwicker My dream FA scenario right now is Bazemore + Dudley + Thomas.  With Brown,DAR,even JC, the switchablilty potential on D is high

TheArmoTrader	702044014837522432	2016-02-23T08:15:11	Bballaddict91 colezwicker I could see him getting as little as 8M or as much as the max. The RFA market might be screwy due to cap spike
TheArmoTrader	702040795822448641	2016-02-23T08:02:23	colezwicker Wait. Is he a RFA?
TheArmoTrader	702038929126502400	2016-02-23T07:54:58	colezwicker Hope he develops that shot. Legit star potential if he does.  Random Q: Lance Thomas,what do u think he gets this summer?

TheArmoTrader	702022344886218752	2016-02-23T06:49:04	LifeOfABruin I think there's a chance yeah. I would really like him at 32. Think he should be a (low) 1st rounder IMO.
TheArmoTrader	702021376694038528	2016-02-23T06:45:13	Bballaddict91 haven't seen him much, but dont think he's likely to declare. Probably worth a late 2nd in 2017,barring a massive improvement
TheArmoTrader	702019546333351936	2016-02-23T06:37:57	xchuyx3 JustRyCole writing about who I want at 32, should be out soon enough.
TheArmoTrader	702018129333846016	2016-02-23T06:32:19	JustRyCole He probably could, but I see him like Jeff Green, Barnes. Best suited as small-ball 4 in this NBA.
TheArmoTrader	702017849900990464	2016-02-23T06:31:12	JustRyCole A small-ball 4? Probably not.
TheArmoTrader	701977247549292544	2016-02-23T03:49:52	LifeOfABruin xchuyx3 Ezeli's restricted status should make him a last ditch attempt. Like Barnes, Fournier, etc. Cant wait until RFA.
TheArmoTrader	701977027297964032	2016-02-23T03:49:00	LifeOfABruin xchuyx3 Why not. I mean, it depends on KD coming or not, but even if he is, I think they'd sign him and flip him.
TheArmoTrader	701976691820728320	2016-02-23T03:47:40	LifeOfABruin xchuyx3 They'd match, b/c why not. And if they're not matching, you gotta be worried (injuries big issue?).
TheArmoTrader	701976295534538752	2016-02-23T03:46:05	LifeOfABruin xchuyx3 GS won't let him go. And he's a RFA. Cant risk sitting on hands until July 12 when moratorium is lifted.
TheArmoTrader	701976059210629120	2016-02-23T03:45:09	LifeOfABruin xchuyx3 You rather sign Mahinmi, Zaza, Noah? If Whiteside can set screens, catch lobs, protect rim, it's a huge upgrade.
TheArmoTrader	701975799058997248	2016-02-23T03:44:07	LifeOfABruin xchuyx3 I don't think he's a cancer, just a dumb-dumb. It's to help Randle &amp; Russell &amp; Clarkson. Who's gonna play C?
TheArmoTrader	701975622688485376	2016-02-23T03:43:25	LifeOfABruin xchuyx3 If they can be Lake Show 2.0, win 35 games, show growth, that's a dream scenario for next season.
TheArmoTrader	701975485832540162	2016-02-23T03:42:52	LifeOfABruin xchuyx3 Good? No. But I don't care about being good soon. I want improvement from young guys + a fun team.
TheArmoTrader	701974797928927232	2016-02-23T03:40:08	Bballaddict91 ShawnFNBA damanr Sure, but POR has a ton of cap space. You'd really need to throw a lot at him. A LOT. &gt;$15M.
TheArmoTrader	701974656241143813	2016-02-23T03:39:34	xchuyx3 Thanks. Love the idea of building a team that can switch a lot &amp; hit 3s. Would help our core sooo much. Add Whiteside to that? Boom
TheArmoTrader	701974241709682689	2016-02-23T03:37:55	Bballaddict91 ShawnFNBA damanr Yeah, Crabbe's interesting, but he seems more like a N Young type than a 3+D Danny Green type.
TheArmoTrader	701973937148694528	2016-02-23T03:36:43	ShawnFNBA damanr +to offer Barnes a contract until July 12. But yeah, your point stands. Can sign Barnes + those guys too if needed.
TheArmoTrader	701973755082309633	2016-02-23T03:35:59	ShawnFNBA damanr Yeah, it's a good gamble. But I think I'd rather sign a trio/duo like I listed, b/c of Barnes' RFA status. Wont be able+
TheArmoTrader	701973276902359041	2016-02-23T03:34:05	ShawnFNBA damanr But who knows if Barnes is a diamond or a rhinestone!
TheArmoTrader	701973102247325697	2016-02-23T03:33:24	Bballaddict91 damanr ShawnFNBA He's like a 3/4. Idea behind signing a group of guys like that is 3P shooting + switchability.
TheArmoTrader	701972413370642433	2016-02-23T03:30:40	damanr ShawnFNBA BUTTT, having said that, if we strike out on UFAs, if it's Barnes (or Fournier) attempt or nothing, go for it.
TheArmoTrader	701972229639139328	2016-02-23T03:29:56	damanr ShawnFNBA I'd rather spread out that money like this: Bazemore like $10M ($30M/3), Lance Thomas $4M ($8M/2), Dudley $8M ($16M/2)
TheArmoTrader	701959137324724224	2016-02-23T02:37:54	JacobRude brosales12 Would start at $21.1M. 25% of cap. But he'd never go above &gt;25% due to 2nd cap jump, even w/ raises.
TheArmoTrader	701953544677494784	2016-02-23T02:15:41	CarlosOnUCLA narmenta Well generally, yeah. But I think stuff is more nuanced than that.
TheArmoTrader	701952082140475392	2016-02-23T02:09:52	narmenta CarlosOnUCLA Yeah, this is my view too. Needs a really good year (&amp; that doesn't ***necessarily*** mean Elite 8+ appearance).
TheArmoTrader	701951603461369856	2016-02-23T02:07:58	TJFsports @ Clarkson, and he'll use that as motivation &amp; become the next Redick and help us back into the playoffs &amp; then hit a game winne
TheArmoTrader	701951394731851776	2016-02-23T02:07:08	TJFsports MAYBE he's a guy who has many hot (45%) &amp; cold (25%) streaks (vs consistently 35%),but I think he's showing he'll have a 3p shot
TheArmoTrader	701950979684458496	2016-02-23T02:05:29	TJFsports Do I think he's a 45% 3P shooter, like he's shown over last month? Nah. But I do think he's above avg (&gt;35%). (1/2)
TheArmoTrader	701950060192407552	2016-02-23T02:01:50	TJFsports Uh, yeah. I think he improved. And last year he was primary PG. Moving off ball seems to also have helped him.
TheArmoTrader	701949752875679744	2016-02-23T02:00:37	TJFsports I mean, just eye test wise, his shot looked gr8 to start season.  And then injury hit,didnt.  Now healthy, looks great again.
TheArmoTrader	701949410477912065	2016-02-23T01:59:15	TJFsports The month after he hurt his ankle, he was shooting &lt;22% from 3.  I think there's some legit correlation here.
TheArmoTrader	701948965063757824	2016-02-23T01:57:29	TJFsports See, I knew that % was lying a few weeks ago. Injury clearly was affecting him. He's at 36% &amp; that's not counting tonight's 4/4
TheArmoTrader	701947640074768384	2016-02-23T01:52:13	TJFsports JustRyCole Weren't you super skeptical about his 3P shooting like 2 weeks ago?
TheArmoTrader	701947431907250176	2016-02-23T01:51:23	JustRyCole BRUH. He's been on fire. Has TJFsports been watching him lately?
TheArmoTrader	701944509051981824	2016-02-23T01:39:47	hmfaigen Oh yeah I know. Still funny.
TheArmoTrader	701944472804831232	2016-02-23T01:39:38	xchuyx3 Yep. Altho, at this current time, Randle+Simmons have no 3pt shot. But at least they'd be told to shoot it here, I think.
TheArmoTrader	701944288989487104	2016-02-23T01:38:54	@Lakers_Current lol LakersSBN hmfaigen
TheArmoTrader	701940298956451840	2016-02-23T01:23:03	xchuyx3 what do u mean?
TheArmoTrader	701938268846161920	2016-02-23T01:14:59	It's not a perfect comp., but Antetokounmpo &amp; Jabari Parker can be a possible blueprint for the Lakers w/ possibly Ben Simmons &amp; Randle.
TheArmoTrader	701936054513696768	2016-02-23T01:06:11	hmfaigen Harrison! Do you believe the Lakers can pull this through and get Kobe that last win the the storied BMO Harris Bradley Center!?
TheArmoTrader	701918826837835777	2016-02-22T23:57:43	presidual The single WORST thing by far the Lakers have done since our last championship.
TheArmoTrader	701916932836950017	2016-02-22T23:50:12	Jeanie Buss's deadline creates a toxic brand of accountability: heightened alarm for one side of the Lakers and rabid control for the other.

TheArmoTrader	701911877958238208	2016-02-22T23:30:07	brosales12 Future can be super bright if Jim (/Jeanie????) Play this right.  Luke, Ryan, young core....
TheArmoTrader	701911349681594368	2016-02-22T23:28:01	theCooler_King JacobRude Sure, When Mitch retires, which might not be anytime soon (tho probably under 10 years).
TheArmoTrader	701910851452665856	2016-02-22T23:26:02	brosales12 The promotion happened a little after the draft, right? Might have a wink-wink deal w/ FO to succeed Mitch when that happens.
TheArmoTrader	701909802805399553	2016-02-22T23:21:52	JacobRude Oh, no I wouldn't want to find out either. Just saying I think there's potential it won't be horrible. But ya, rather not do that
TheArmoTrader	701908365388021760	2016-02-22T23:16:09	JacobRude I might be crazy, but I don't think Kobe would necessarily be horrible. She could do much worse IMO.
TheArmoTrader	701907822175326208	2016-02-22T23:14:00	JonathanTjarks Haven't read it yet, but not surprised.  Remember how they botched the Shabazz Muhammad investigation? So bad.
TheArmoTrader	701907009134661632	2016-02-22T23:10:46	brosales12 Like,if we have a west-adjusted 14/15 Celtics type season, I dont see how she can be like "Derp,we didnt make the WCF,Jim sucks"
TheArmoTrader	701905751124480001	2016-02-22T23:05:46	mattbilinsky As in she's canning Jim no matter what,or that shes just doing this to show public that shes doin "something" to improve team?
TheArmoTrader	701904672777342976	2016-02-22T23:01:29	brosales12 She's gonna have a REAL tough time "removing" Jim(/Mitch) if the team gets a decent W bump, is fun, showing progess, etc.

TheArmoTrader	701597124333408256	2016-02-22T02:39:24	ajstarting5 brosales12 That's my view too,but I'd hope the guy(s) we sign would be able to share the floor w/ him. I question that w/ DDR
TheArmoTrader	701595670055034881	2016-02-22T02:33:37	brosales12 +play your best players together, then is it worth the investment?
TheArmoTrader	701595563888803841	2016-02-22T02:33:12	brosales12 Well, he'll be 27 next season :) Production not an issue, fit with the core is. Staggering mitigates issues, but if you cant+
TheArmoTrader	701594563769536512	2016-02-22T02:29:13	brosales12 TJFsports JustRyCole  1) Contract year 2) Even so,the overlap b/w him &amp; Clarkson is just, uh,not great. Can u play DAR-JC-DDR?

TheArmoTrader	701593757146157056	2016-02-22T02:26:01	TJFsports JustRyCole Read this, guys. You'll see my position on DDR in there, and the explanation.
TheArmoTrader	701593403058860032	2016-02-22T02:24:36	Read about why I think the Lakers must be concerned about more than just adding talent in free agency 
TheArmoTrader	701590472477642752	2016-02-22T02:12:58	montoyan Why not just @ Dutch_Book right away?
TheArmoTrader	701589277180755968	2016-02-22T02:08:13	brosales12 I could see why he receives a lot of praise from former fan bases
TheArmoTrader	701587999159488512	2016-02-22T02:03:08	kyrandarcy This is where coaching needs to come in....no reason why a Russell/Randle P&amp;R cant work.
TheArmoTrader	701587723908288512	2016-02-22T02:02:02	RyanKelapire what's the problem?
TheArmoTrader	701552082893934592	2016-02-21T23:40:25	JustRyCole DUDE. It's gonna be the next game. Will have 25 games left. Byron has a fetish with whole/round numbers, you know...
TheArmoTrader	701543149194186752	2016-02-21T23:04:55	FlyByKnite that sucked, AD even ran for the ball
TheArmoTrader	701542758855548928	2016-02-21T23:03:22	Original_Gio I LOVED THE Thompson pick. But the Bennet pick was such a reach. Shouldve gone Noel, but Gilbert wanted to "win now"
TheArmoTrader	701542488209666049	2016-02-21T23:02:17	sspencer_smb There's so many great young big men. AD, Towns, Zinger, Drummond, Draymond, Gobert...some B-tier guys too, gonna be fun
TheArmoTrader	701541963460284416	2016-02-21T23:00:12	FlyByKnite Broadcast is showing since '63-64....typo?
TheArmoTrader	701541724506599424	2016-02-21T22:59:15	Anthony Davis now has the third game since 1983-84 with 50 points and 20 rebounds. He has 59 points and 20 rebounds right now.
TheArmoTrader	701540918910799872	2016-02-21T22:56:03	daldridgetnt Need 1 point and 1 rebound with 1:11 left. StayWoke
TheArmoTrader	701540115785515008	2016-02-21T22:52:52	Anthony Davis is unreal right now. Un-freaking-real.
TheArmoTrader	701539766626447361	2016-02-21T22:51:28	samesfandiari He's only 24, maybe a change of scenery and suddenly he's in the convo of being an all-star. He just needs things to click
TheArmoTrader	701524291465011200	2016-02-21T21:49:59	elandcohen Yeah, if by the time July 12 rolls around (when the moratorium is lifted), if LAL has striken out, don't mind that.
