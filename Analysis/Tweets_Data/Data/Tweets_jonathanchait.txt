jonathanchait	702563480688332800	2016-02-24T18:39:21	DouthatNYT asymmetricinfo Agree. Rubio would torture suspected terrorists. Trump would also kill their families. Trump is worse, conceded.
jonathanchait	702563130841440256	2016-02-24T18:37:58	asymmetricinfo DouthatNYT I consider Obama's policies important/effective, and their dismantling a historic tragedy. That's a big diff.

jonathanchait	702560527638269952	2016-02-24T18:27:37	asymmetricinfo DouthatNYT IMO Rubio would more diligently pursue conservative movement priorities such as destroying climate accords.

jonathanchait	702559719668510720	2016-02-24T18:24:24	DouthatNYT asymmetricinfo Easiest answer is that destroying international climate accords can't be unwound. Can't un-melt glaciers.

jonathanchait	702555773755326464	2016-02-24T18:08:43	DouthatNYT mattyglesias DamonLinker and I think conservative movement control of the GOP has to be broken somehow.
