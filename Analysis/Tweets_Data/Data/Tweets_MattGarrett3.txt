MattGarrett3	701239449145966592	2016-02-21T02:58:07	dennismarta my thought is we are not capable of getting those types of candidates to run and elected. ericbeebo
MattGarrett3	701237946662445057	2016-02-21T02:52:09	dennismarta ericbeebo We need something. but IMO thats more addressing a symptom than a cause at this point.

MattGarrett3	701235091410968576	2016-02-21T02:40:48	dennismarta ericbeebo The real crazy IMO is that people are growing up with this and its all they know making it their "normal".
MattGarrett3	701234599851122688	2016-02-21T02:38:51	ericbeebo dennismarta I say that has always been there, just below the surface maybe.

MattGarrett3	701152274572247040	2016-02-20T21:11:43	CAVandy modestproposal1 my view is any given approach probably stops working. And if it does, the thought behind it is still valuable.
MattGarrett3	701151862565769217	2016-02-20T21:10:05	CAVandy modestproposal1 if anything markets should teach people to be flexible in their thinking and curious about other approaches.

MattGarrett3	701114268331147265	2016-02-20T18:40:42	pdacosta SamuelRines in '12 was talking about the ramping E&amp;P credit cycle dwarfing previous one. Some lenders avoided the space.
