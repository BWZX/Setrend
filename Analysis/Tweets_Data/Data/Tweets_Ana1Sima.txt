Ana1Sima	686294951865368576	2016-01-10T21:14:01	SunshineNYC good! Back on the job hunt, adopted a new dog, and started working out again. Working on a better me. How about you?
Ana1Sima	686278445030977536	2016-01-10T20:08:26	Alright, off to get my cardio in and live in the real world üòÇ
Ana1Sima	686277832280915968	2016-01-10T20:06:00	If everyone were like her, the world would be a much better place for all animals!
Ana1Sima	686277560464879617	2016-01-10T20:04:55	Hmm I'd give SunshineNYC an extra $10M to disperse to the animal shelters of her choosing. That's 10 not 1. I love her commitment to animal
Ana1Sima	686276888575148032	2016-01-10T20:02:15	nromyn ha! So really not that often!
Ana1Sima	686276748158177280	2016-01-10T20:01:41	I'd give darth $2M. Only because he brings me joy daily. Plus he should be compensated for my profile pics!
Ana1Sima	686275734386556928	2016-01-10T19:57:40	gravestonedoji post. Nice round number.
Ana1Sima	686274507061854209	2016-01-10T19:52:47	martyguthrie meh just tell her your my mistress. She'd probably buy that ;)
Ana1Sima	686274025115365376	2016-01-10T19:50:52	Lol at least I amuse myself.
Ana1Sima	686273932375109632	2016-01-10T19:50:30	And that's a 1 in like 4 billion chance. So not impossible!
Ana1Sima	686273738099142656	2016-01-10T19:49:44	If you ever get an invite (and accompanying plane ticket) to a private island, it's because I'm throwing a party and handing out checks üòò
Ana1Sima	686273244270219264	2016-01-10T19:47:46	So roughly 300 between Twitter and Facebook would make the cut. I'd still be left with $1B...
Ana1Sima	686272834411233280	2016-01-10T19:46:08	Obviously, those that have me muted would be shit out of luck ;)
Ana1Sima	686272663489126400	2016-01-10T19:45:27	Everyone who's stuck by my side and actively has supported me these last few years.
Ana1Sima	686272280251334657	2016-01-10T19:43:56	On a serious note, if I won the powerball, I'd give $1M to everyone that follow me and vice versa and that have stuck through the years.
Ana1Sima	686257414337900544	2016-01-10T18:44:52	volatilitysmile at least someone's getting shagged!
Ana1Sima	686253573127168001	2016-01-10T18:29:36	My everyday status. 
Ana1Sima	686250698468651009	2016-01-10T18:18:11	grampa7 lol probably $13 for express!
Ana1Sima	686250518331670528	2016-01-10T18:17:28	SnatchOrGrab I would!
Ana1Sima	686250358100869121	2016-01-10T18:16:49	grampa7 may really need to look into that. I mean, why not? It's only $2!
Ana1Sima	686142797464875010	2016-01-10T11:09:25	I'd buy an island too. One right beside Richard Branson. He probably throws the best block parties.
Ana1Sima	686142265010577410	2016-01-10T11:07:18	The pilots would also sub as my cabana boys.
Ana1Sima	686142109099884544	2016-01-10T11:06:41	Ok ok I'd probably buy one of those nice jet planes, hire a couple arm candy pilots and travel the world.
Ana1Sima	686141770414030849	2016-01-10T11:05:20	FXAlgo why? I hate people ;)
Ana1Sima	686141407665491968	2016-01-10T11:03:54	Seriously, what would one do with that much cash? Get a hobby? Like cocaine? That's a hobby right?
Ana1Sima	686140200800645120	2016-01-10T10:59:06	Oh well, what's $1B anyway? 
Ana1Sima	686139425760362496	2016-01-10T10:56:01	Was thinking of making a short drive to the states (10hrs one way) to pick up some powerball tix. Then remembered still no passport!
Ana1Sima	685971909415014400	2016-01-09T23:50:22	alex_smrnov ugh I have enough fruit on my plate.

Ana1Sima	685559616466370560	2016-01-08T20:32:04	SapienQuis NotStevieCohen Twitter was actually fun when this guy was around.

Ana1Sima	684489844458782720	2016-01-05T21:41:10	Just finished the Biggest Loser Wii fit test. I am to work in the challenging stage.. Ugh. No pain no gain or whatever that stupid saying is
Ana1Sima	684217911628574720	2016-01-05T03:40:36	Some chick just weighed in at -17lbs in one week. That's incredible. I'd be thrilled with 5. My goal for next week.
Ana1Sima	684217221229367296	2016-01-05T03:37:52	To top it off, turned TV and season premiere of Biggest Loser started today! This is my sign. Now to log in, and start an account with them!

Ana1Sima	683830460321890304	2016-01-04T02:01:01	dasan it's easy to become a foster parent. Impossiblely hard to become an actual adoptive parent. There's a difference.
Ana1Sima	683813956830367744	2016-01-04T00:55:26	4M orphaned kids (if commercials can be believed) and it's almost impossible to adopt 1. What gives?
Ana1Sima	683813653968097281	2016-01-04T00:54:14	Its so easy to send money to needy children around the world but why is it so hard to just adopt them?
