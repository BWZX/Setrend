SunriseTrader	712039870391324672	2016-03-21T22:15:08	When first starting as a trader your goal is to learn &amp; hone your skills until you are consistently profitable. Know your system/style/edge
SunriseTrader	712038753855000577	2016-03-21T22:10:42	There is always another trade. If you miss an entry you missed the entry. Learn to love the word next. Stay focused &amp; catch the next one.
SunriseTrader	712038166245613570	2016-03-21T22:08:22	Indicators are derived from price. Think about what I just typed.  You must know how to read price action. Only use an indicator to confirm
SunriseTrader	712037416270479361	2016-03-21T22:05:23	I am not a breakout trader.  Find what works for you and if it works stick with it. Wash, rinse, repeat over and over. Keep it simple
SunriseTrader	712037215573053440	2016-03-21T22:04:35	My favorite and often most profitable swing trades come from 2 categories. Stocks basing at key levels and dumpster dive trades.
SunriseTrader	712037001751568384	2016-03-21T22:03:44	If I knife catch using a daily I have very specific rules. The chart must pass all the rules. A positive divergence with reverse stick key
SunriseTrader	712036675048841217	2016-03-21T22:02:26	My day trade rules for knife catching are all based on price and levels using short term  intraday charts
SunriseTrader	712036188417335296	2016-03-21T22:00:30	On the flip side buying on the 4th to 6th day up most times is chasing look to buy on day 1 or 2 with the smart money.  Risk vs reward
SunriseTrader	712035839497342979	2016-03-21T21:59:07	Knife catching can be tricky. If a stock sells off look at the 3rd/4th day down to dip toes as the news is probably fully discounted
SunriseTrader	712034471177031685	2016-03-21T21:53:41	When markets move lateral to down your job does not have to be make big cash short it might be more prudent to protect cash &amp; be patient

SunriseTrader	711626603025960960	2016-03-20T18:52:58	Keep it simple folks. Don't overthink. Don't overuse signals. Simple, simple, simple makes money and keeps noise &amp; confusion at bay STUDY
SunriseTrader	711625972945039360	2016-03-20T18:50:27	Remember moving averages lag so the longer the time frame the longer the lag. Short time frame less lag staying closer to actual price. KISS
SunriseTrader	711624709217976320	2016-03-20T18:45:26	Moving averages help silence &amp; smooth the noise, when looking at a chart. Remember they are lagging indicators. They help with trend visual

SunriseTrader	711623740694474752	2016-03-20T18:41:35	My opinion = moving averages are not gospel they are levels where buyers/sellers may show up. See it first.
SunriseTrader	711622995739955200	2016-03-20T18:38:38	jedimarkus77 MY opinion financial power cares most about the 50 and 200
SunriseTrader	711620819248504832	2016-03-20T18:29:59	Pay attention to the direction of the moving averages and the order. Shortest on top and in correct order = bullish 5/9/21/50 etc STUDY
SunriseTrader	711619343939805184	2016-03-20T18:24:07	Markets can work off overbought using price or time. Price is often faster and time can be choppy. Do your best to read the tea leaves
SunriseTrader	711618868842639360	2016-03-20T18:22:14	The market loves to fool the masses, don't be one of them. No one knows what it next. Plan it see it, trade it. Let price come to your level
SunriseTrader	711618001120808964	2016-03-20T18:18:47	Overbought by itself is not a sell signal. It is a signal to tighten stops/ take some profits if long. Be cautious to take on new positions

SunriseTrader	704020382030823424	2016-02-28T19:08:33	simplennoteasy It means initiating a new position there has more risk.

SunriseTrader	699366037507026944	2016-02-15T22:53:51	Don't make trading hard, keep it simple, keep your charts simple and clean use few oscillators if any at all. Use multiple time frames
SunriseTrader	699365681603571712	2016-02-15T22:52:26	Save your old charts/notes. Former support once lost often becomes current resistance. Former resistance once above often becomes support

SunriseTrader	699332417304137728	2016-02-15T20:40:15	Counter trend rallies happen in every type of market. Market trends don't change quickly, they test over and over.
SunriseTrader	699332074080116737	2016-02-15T20:38:54	Many traders wear themselves out and kill their capital. Death by a thousand cuts is not money management or money making strategy.
SunriseTrader	699331454958858240	2016-02-15T20:36:26	Stock trading is not about being perfect in your read. Always know the trend. When in doubt stay out. There is always another trade.

SunriseTrader	699329265725116417	2016-02-15T20:27:44	SPX 1800 was/is big level of price support. In time it won't surprise me if we test back to the year 2000 high &amp; 2007 high &amp; 2013 breakout
SunriseTrader	699328647824445440	2016-02-15T20:25:17	Never put on blinders when reviewing the market. Keep an open, unbiased mind. You will save your wallet and emotions.  Use your eyes
SunriseTrader	699328231585873920	2016-02-15T20:23:37	The indices monthly charts are under a lot of pressure and the word 'haunting' as I have said for months, is still the same.
SunriseTrader	699327886587596800	2016-02-15T20:22:15	Two ETF's that will be on my radar are the IWM QQQ to see if risk appetite is here for the short term. Clear resist levels overhead

SunriseTrader	699325604915580929	2016-02-15T20:13:11	Relief bounces are just that, a relief.  Most times the major trend will resume again in time. Identify the big pic &amp; short term trend
SunriseTrader	699325074961084418	2016-02-15T20:11:05	When you get positive d's on the oscillators on many indices and many sectors relief bounces often follow. Always see reverse stick first.
SunriseTrader	699324699784847361	2016-02-15T20:09:35	When relief bounces take place it is often an opportunity where those who bought at higher prices look for a chance to get out. Know resist

SunriseTrader	697460465455095808	2016-02-10T16:41:47	Remember in a bull market we bought the dips? Now in a bear market shorting the rips is the money making side of a trade. Bear market action
SunriseTrader	697457613982728192	2016-02-10T16:30:27	Remember without our health none of this matters. Do something that works your body and lets your mind relax. Be safe, be well.

SunriseTrader	687673972310163456	2016-01-14T16:33:46	In down trend markets oversold can stay oversold for a long time. Not a buy signal must have an accompanying candle signal.
