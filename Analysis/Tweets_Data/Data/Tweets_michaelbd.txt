michaelbd	724080893288189953	2016-04-24T03:41:52	robertagreer Which Christian denominations currently proscribe shellfish consumption? Name five.
michaelbd	724080695027601409	2016-04-24T03:41:05	robertagreer This question is a near perfect example of bigoted ignorance about Christian belief masquerading as superior knowledge of it.

michaelbd	724079777674584064	2016-04-24T03:37:26	robertagreer Maybe the near constant pathologization of and moral panic about  orthodox Christian belief

michaelbd	723885866280738817	2016-04-23T14:46:54	graydomn But, are you committed to the idea that Asquith-Carson had the right to start/threaten  a civil war to modify Home Rule?

michaelbd	718547791321112578	2016-04-08T21:15:18	go_oat I’m writing my more considered response now. You can imply it is racist-faithless-click driven in tweets later.
michaelbd	718547308737073152	2016-04-08T21:13:23	go_oat I don’t even find my apostasy prediction wrong. I just find the apostasy of the document well-disguised and cowardly.
michaelbd	718546820595638274	2016-04-08T21:11:26	go_oat I think you tweeted earlier the thing I think is at the root of the problem with the document. No one believes sacrilege is real

michaelbd	718544771975880705	2016-04-08T21:03:18	go_oat I did not predict he would sneak it into a footnote no. Unfortunately the doc enshrines the pessimism that leads to Kasper.

michaelbd	718425429560967169	2016-04-08T13:09:04	MenAreLikeWine1 I think the error verges on heresy.

michaelbd	718197351274450944	2016-04-07T22:02:46	alexhazanov yeselson right.  My goal, by 40: speak, read and write: Irish, French. Speak and read Spanish. (Also be wealthy and fit :) )
michaelbd	718189278329769984	2016-04-07T21:30:41	alexhazanov yeselson Anyway, I don’t think bi-lingualism has to have a strong political valence as a cause.
michaelbd	718188538571960322	2016-04-07T21:27:45	alexhazanov yeselson In the British Isles, it tends not to be citified that have Irish, Scots, Welsh, Manx. (though Irish is changing)
michaelbd	718185894147158016	2016-04-07T21:17:15	clupbert it is more nonsense. But it is surrounded by enough stuff that everyone can put their emphasis where they want.
michaelbd	718185714563858433	2016-04-07T21:16:32	clupbert Hence his claim that VII doc on liturgy is “ours, traditional” when it manifestly is not.
michaelbd	718185524532547584	2016-04-07T21:15:46	clupbert Z always prefers to put his spin on a document rather than dissent from it.
michaelbd	718185236601958400	2016-04-07T21:14:38	yeselson I’m not sure. My rough guess is bi-linguals roughly divided between cosmopolitans and bumpkins
michaelbd	718184978530574337	2016-04-07T21:13:36	clupbert It says can’t make the Kasper prop a rule without being unfaithful. However it also can’t expect to hold people to existing rule
michaelbd	718184726251638784	2016-04-07T21:12:36	clupbert it neither passes or fails, or it does both at the same time? It definitely contradicts recent magisterial teaching.
michaelbd	718184326173736964	2016-04-07T21:11:01	clupbert I’ve read the last bits. It is confused.

michaelbd	718087552486481921	2016-04-07T14:46:28	jaycaspiankang I wonder how many of the young national writers who champion brash-ball are bilingual. Very few.
michaelbd	718086429193187328	2016-04-07T14:42:00	jaycaspiankang Okay.
michaelbd	718085816006868992	2016-04-07T14:39:34	SamAdlerBell jaycaspiankang  I wouldn’t try. Even if older players have always complained about young “flashy” guys going back to Ty Cobb
michaelbd	718085293245640704	2016-04-07T14:37:29	jaycaspiankang But media faces practical challenges. Places with Higher hispanic populations are getting Hispanic media first
michaelbd	718084491059847168	2016-04-07T14:34:18	jaycaspiankang Of course it was/is.
michaelbd	718083711644860416	2016-04-07T14:31:12	jaycaspiankang That will change as young bi-lingual reporters start establishing fruitful relationships with prospects.
michaelbd	718083593449443328	2016-04-07T14:30:44	jaycaspiankang Maybe. My guess is people with the candlepower to conduct interviews in 2 languages, not content with beat writer grind.
michaelbd	718082690633842688	2016-04-07T14:27:09	jaycaspiankang Overlap between people who grew up wanting to be sportswriters and bi-lingual was probably low in 60s-70s.
michaelbd	718082213955444736	2016-04-07T14:25:15	jaycaspiankang And some markets have them- Miami, LA. But not enough.
michaelbd	718081894370451456	2016-04-07T14:23:59	jaycaspiankang Man, it’s going to take a while. Learning Spanish is on my list. But beat writers at underfunded local papers?
michaelbd	718081626341785601	2016-04-07T14:22:55	jaycaspiankang Yes. Players unhappy with it too. I recall Billy Wagner losing his mind that half the Mets not being asked about losses
michaelbd	718080302577528832	2016-04-07T14:17:40	jaycaspiankang I suppose I thought your column was perpetuating a set of stereotypes while claiming to oppose them.
michaelbd	718079976965337088	2016-04-07T14:16:22	jaycaspiankang Or maybe I’m lumping you in with other writers who seem to want capitulation to new culture rather than a fight for one?
michaelbd	718079757561307137	2016-04-07T14:15:30	jaycaspiankang I praised the last line as coming to the right. Maybe I misread the middle of it?
michaelbd	718079692952178689	2016-04-07T14:15:14	jaycaspiankang There are a ton of conflicts. My bet is the conflicts drive more interests than well-told stories Anglophone media misses
michaelbd	718079002141962240	2016-04-07T14:12:30	jaycaspiankang We agree they do a bad job. But Jose Bautista’s bat flip was a media phenomenon.
michaelbd	718078462284730368	2016-04-07T14:10:21	jaycaspiankang 
michaelbd	718077781809184769	2016-04-07T14:07:39	jaycaspiankang It’s not denying race or racism to point out that these stereotypes can also be misleading.
michaelbd	718077485292855297	2016-04-07T14:06:28	jaycaspiankang Well, the media, especially young media, treated Papelbon like a villain for going at  Harper.
michaelbd	718076978159566849	2016-04-07T14:04:27	jaycaspiankang Yes. And swagger comes in many forms. Is Papelbon “provocative” “swaggering” or part of the hidebound honor-culture? Both?
michaelbd	718076410137542657	2016-04-07T14:02:12	jaycaspiankang I don’t see my piece as disagreeing outright, just adding (and clarifying) to what you wrote.
michaelbd	718076280093196288	2016-04-07T14:01:41	jaycaspiankang He’s only the NL MVP who’s been in the news this pre-season and this week arguing for brash baseball.
michaelbd	718075874533380096	2016-04-07T14:00:04	jaycaspiankang Harper is hugely popular among “the people” even if he rubs other players the wrong way. And always has.
michaelbd	718075227650048001	2016-04-07T13:57:30	jaycaspiankang 
michaelbd	718075138772754432	2016-04-07T13:57:08	jaycaspiankang Harper didn’t become brash only after last year’s bat toss.
michaelbd	718075000876613632	2016-04-07T13:56:36	jaycaspiankang craigcalcaterra Further you’re not clear whether this culture war drives interest or drives it away.
michaelbd	718074934090661888	2016-04-07T13:56:20	jaycaspiankang craigcalcaterra I don’t say your point is invalidated- I say it’s true, just not the whole story.
michaelbd	718074787080364032	2016-04-07T13:55:45	jaycaspiankang Harper has been a figure of conflict with his own teammates ever since his debut.

michaelbd	718045332253356032	2016-04-07T11:58:42	craigcalcaterra bogcommenter It seemed, odd, to write a piece in favor of brash baseball, and ignore the leading player stumping for it
michaelbd	718044504616517632	2016-04-07T11:55:25	craigcalcaterra bogcommenter Over and over again I say that it does overlap with racial divides and tension, just not entirely
michaelbd	718038500281610240	2016-04-07T11:31:33	rbm411 jaycaspiankang There are some reasons to believe the television money bubble will burst.

michaelbd	717719780434788352	2016-04-06T14:25:04	CoCoCoryCollins Travis_Waldron We say the symbols are so important we must ban- and when I propose diverse symbols, they’re unimportant.
michaelbd	717719158255968257	2016-04-06T14:22:36	CoCoCoryCollins Travis_Waldron Neither do I. But you don’t find the implication odd that kids can only root for Trojans, Vikings, Irish?
michaelbd	717718801421352961	2016-04-06T14:21:11	CoCoCoryCollins Travis_Waldron You're just rephrasing my point in the most hostile way, rather than engaging it.
michaelbd	717718198053904384	2016-04-06T14:18:47	CoCoCoryCollins Travis_Waldron But others cannot be represented because- the implication will be obvious- they can’t be accepted.
michaelbd	717718078113640449	2016-04-06T14:18:19	CoCoCoryCollins Travis_Waldron The message will be that whites can be represented because they are accepted and can be treated “lightly”
michaelbd	717717929786216448	2016-04-06T14:17:43	CoCoCoryCollins Travis_Waldron That’s not to the point.
michaelbd	717717196277956608	2016-04-06T14:14:48	amhill Travis_Waldron CoCoCoryCollins Right, not my point.

michaelbd	717716886432182274	2016-04-06T14:13:34	CoCoCoryCollins Travis_Waldron That doesn’t change harm of the past. But it does raise a question for now, the future.
michaelbd	717716665945948160	2016-04-06T14:12:42	CoCoCoryCollins Travis_Waldron When we forbid ourselves from rooting for Native/black/Asian symbols, we are saying they are never accepted
michaelbd	717716467316293632	2016-04-06T14:11:54	CoCoCoryCollins Travis_Waldron Right, but there’s an oddity, to saying we can make a silly Irish figure because they are accepted
michaelbd	717714066752598016	2016-04-06T14:02:22	Travis_Waldron CoCoCoryCollins I just wonder if its not odd for a diverse country to despair of rooting for anything but non-white mascots
michaelbd	717713666053971968	2016-04-06T14:00:47	CoCoCoryCollins Travis_Waldron But this is going to bring about a situation that in a few decades will also seem odd, unfair.
michaelbd	717713485963128832	2016-04-06T14:00:04	CoCoCoryCollins Travis_Waldron Right. And I’m fine with doing away with logos that cause harm or anxiety to neighbors.
michaelbd	717713033712242688	2016-04-06T13:58:16	CoCoCoryCollins Travis_Waldron Oh, with that I agree.

michaelbd	717429042320904193	2016-04-05T19:09:47	MarkHerman987 I think the way to avoid conflict is generally to allow people to discrim on content/events, not classes of people.

michaelbd	717426627899211778	2016-04-05T19:00:11	thitchner Well, in this case usually it would be a church.
michaelbd	717426513944178690	2016-04-05T18:59:44	MarkHerman987 Because it was irrelevant and inflammatory.
michaelbd	717426401780088832	2016-04-05T18:59:17	thitchner But this isn’t Jim Crow south where there is an effective monopoly of printing/floral/baking resources.
michaelbd	717426117670531073	2016-04-05T18:58:10	thitchner So could we compel a Protestant baker to bake bread to be used in a Catholic Mass where he believes it is idolatry?
michaelbd	717425808835477509	2016-04-05T18:56:56	thitchner I think so. It’s about content of the event, service. Baronelle Stutzman only refused wedding arrangement not gay client.
michaelbd	717425615209635840	2016-04-05T18:56:10	srbrown70 So, if a Jewish photographer gets hired by the Klan, Klan can sue him if he refuses the work?

michaelbd	717425163676028928	2016-04-05T18:54:22	thitchner Well, it’s not just bakers, but say, a Church that owns a hall that is rented out.

michaelbd	717424783068102656	2016-04-05T18:52:52	thitchner I find it weird that the secularist side is arguing for compelling people to participate in private solemnities they object to
michaelbd	717424617292476416	2016-04-05T18:52:12	thitchner Right. A communist book publisher should be allowed to discriminate against say, Ayn Rand’s books too.
michaelbd	717424457665617920	2016-04-05T18:51:34	srbrown70 Neither is the baker or print-shop owner. They are just chosing what they are willing to participate in.
michaelbd	717424321606590466	2016-04-05T18:51:02	srbrown70 No. They are exchanging money for work. They are allowed to discriminate in what work they print.

michaelbd	717423221381931008	2016-04-05T18:46:39	srbrown70 Just as my employers would discriminate against the viewpoints of certain authors, etc.
michaelbd	717423124405465088	2016-04-05T18:46:16	srbrown70 It may! So too would say, an atheist print shop, that won’t in conscience print pamphlets promoting religion.
michaelbd	717422974920482816	2016-04-05T18:45:40	spencerwindes An atheist print shop is perfectly within its rights to not print my church’s pamphlets.

michaelbd	717421685377523712	2016-04-05T18:40:33	You turned the client down because your conscience forbids you to participate in solemnities against your religion? That’s illegal.
michaelbd	717421402790432768	2016-04-05T18:39:26	You turned down the client because it wasn’t to your taste, the location was too far, you were busy, you wanted that day off, all fine.

michaelbd	717418245125496833	2016-04-05T18:26:53	davelamb9000 MZHemingway The animus is in thinking that practicing religion has no bearing outside of church walls or in your own head.
michaelbd	717416698140299264	2016-04-05T18:20:44	davelamb9000 Well, the animus towards religious people is quite visible, obvious.
michaelbd	717415965718409217	2016-04-05T18:17:49	davelamb9000 Like, forcing nuns to consent to compensating their employees in contraception? Try this:

michaelbd	717411601809276928	2016-04-05T18:00:29	sarahposner Pedophiles exist too. But it is good evidence of animus if 1st thing you think of a nondiscrim statute is "this protects pedos"
michaelbd	717410527635447808	2016-04-05T17:56:13	Pretty effed way to read a provision forbidding  state from discriminating against an adoptive parent's religion

michaelbd	717066657521397761	2016-04-04T19:09:48	mikesbadtweets Usually the criticism I get is that I’m too admiring of Islam. 
michaelbd	717065807025537025	2016-04-04T19:06:25	mikesbadtweets FWIW, my view is that integrating Islam in the West is necessary, we must give up “assimilating” it  
michaelbd	717064858106200064	2016-04-04T19:02:39	mikesbadtweets Its not an aspersion to recognize that what may be merely irritating to Christians constitutes a great offense to Islam.

michaelbd	717062107464929280	2016-04-04T18:51:43	mikesbadtweets And larger problems of the same type exist for integrating Islam into the West successfully.
michaelbd	717061989491744769	2016-04-04T18:51:15	mikesbadtweets  In this particular case, some easy solutions at hand. But the principles asserted by each side will be in conflict shortly.
michaelbd	717061306315046912	2016-04-04T18:48:32	mikesbadtweets My point is that important questions, particularly around religious issues, can be dismissed as mere paperwork.
michaelbd	717061108322799618	2016-04-04T18:47:45	mikesbadtweets I don’t think I’m a victim. I just see two exclusive and irresolvable claims by my government and my church.

michaelbd	717060112054091776	2016-04-04T18:43:47	mikesbadtweets Well, then we just disagree.
michaelbd	717059859296952320	2016-04-04T18:42:47	mikesbadtweets Yeah, Thomas More didn’t file his paperwork with the King either. Turns out it was a big deal.
michaelbd	717059770004455425	2016-04-04T18:42:26	mikesbadtweets Not claiming it is new. Just that liberalism and pluralism are headed for worse collisions
michaelbd	717058398156681216	2016-04-04T18:36:59	mikesbadtweets Yes it is. It relates to having multiple exclusive conceptions of health-care within a society. Diversity not code for race
michaelbd	717057768285413377	2016-04-04T18:34:28	mikesbadtweets Look at Little Sisters case. US admins “health-care” but Catholic health hospitals view contraception as a sin, not care.
michaelbd	717057011934969857	2016-04-04T18:31:28	mikesbadtweets Yes, they are. My tweet gestured at my belief that the nation state’s style of governance is increasingly unsuitable
michaelbd	717054037527494656	2016-04-04T18:19:39	mikesbadtweets I was contrasting it to the administrative style of Empire which is looser, has larger decentralized components.
michaelbd	717053899031625728	2016-04-04T18:19:06	mikesbadtweets No, I meant more the 4 century process of redrawing Europes borders along national lines.
michaelbd	717053813727879168	2016-04-04T18:18:46	mikesbadtweets Or say, the state decided what health care can “mean” 
michaelbd	717053349393219584	2016-04-04T18:16:55	mikesbadtweets To be specific, drawing up codes to criminalize “religious offense” will be more difficult given  
michaelbd	717052599065772032	2016-04-04T18:13:56	mikesbadtweets I think you could describe the rise of nationalism as a process of rationalizing, centralizing.
michaelbd	717050313509847041	2016-04-04T18:04:51	mikesbadtweets It means that diverse people will have views, patterns of life that aren’t reconcilable under a uniform code.
michaelbd	717046803598811136	2016-04-04T17:50:54	The idea that you can have a truly diverse society with administrative uniformity is going to come under a great deal of strain soon.

michaelbd	717043584147578880	2016-04-04T17:38:07	alexhazanov A new tire is cheaper than an accident. But insuring for tires makes tires more expensive.
michaelbd	717042458350194689	2016-04-04T17:33:38	alexhazanov have to think this fight as the point of the rule. Insuring contraception makes no economic or logical sense.
michaelbd	717042262316818432	2016-04-04T17:32:51	alexhazanov It’s relevant to the politics. Easier for their rights to be tossed than to rewrite an HHS rule.
michaelbd	717041400857161728	2016-04-04T17:29:26	alexhazanov this wasn’t even part of the legislation, it’s a rule by HHS
michaelbd	717041100133896194	2016-04-04T17:28:14	alexhazanov Yes, easier to beat up on hospice nuns. Who cares about religious psychos?
michaelbd	717040668699398144	2016-04-04T17:26:32	alexhazanov all employers. Less imposing means do exist. Do away with this abominable form for one.
michaelbd	717040101151358977	2016-04-04T17:24:16	alexhazanov it’s just evidence against the governments idea that it has a compelling interest
michaelbd	717039944267657217	2016-04-04T17:23:39	alexhazanov idea that least restrictive means to contraception access can only be effectively provided by nuns acting as employers is dumb
michaelbd	717039497192587266	2016-04-04T17:21:52	alexhazanov that is a broad way of describing it.
michaelbd	717039125094932480	2016-04-04T17:20:24	alexhazanov Except Citibank and the state of NY and about 25 percent of grandfathered plans don’t have to follow this HHS rule by law.
michaelbd	717038917728485377	2016-04-04T17:19:34	alexhazanov Even when decoupled the nuns will be sued eventually for not providing assisted suicide at their facilities
michaelbd	717038596218347520	2016-04-04T17:18:17	alexhazanov Right. So the nuns should close up because you dislike the people that pay their counsel? (Name some of them)
michaelbd	717036641609773056	2016-04-04T17:10:31	alexhazanov Do you think all nuns who take care of the poor are just deluded pawns for the interests of theocrats? Or just these nuns?

michaelbd	717035476180410368	2016-04-04T17:05:54	alexhazanov oh right, they’re just collateral damage of people who want to get conscientious Catholics out of employing anyone.

michaelbd	716380673171464193	2016-04-02T21:43:56	Runthenovel You changed her description of the Church’s position in America with a prescription for the Church’s self-conception.
michaelbd	716379582786625536	2016-04-02T21:39:36	Runthenovel O’Connor wrote “as if authority were generally accepted.” You rewrite it as “ ‘act’ as if she had not the truth”
michaelbd	716378571573432321	2016-04-02T21:35:35	Runthenovel Where she it cannot act as if civil society accepted the Church’s claims, you said she promoted secular society as ideal.

michaelbd	708866710305161218	2016-03-13T04:06:08	ellenbrenna As always, the answer is for the damned Tudors to return the monasteries and give back the people their ancient Rites.
michaelbd	708865792922750976	2016-03-13T04:02:29	ellenbrenna Well that makes me feel guilty just before I get on a plane :)
michaelbd	708865597594058753	2016-03-13T04:01:43	ellenbrenna It’s telling that one of the markers of elite parenting now is an unusual willingness to limit screen time. They know.
michaelbd	708865023943249921	2016-03-13T03:59:26	ellenbrenna Broadcast television is the liturgy of late capitalism. And like liturgy it reshapes our souls. Someday we’ll repent of screens
michaelbd	708864379454930944	2016-03-13T03:56:52	ellenbrenna The pattern of elite life (regardless of ideology) looks like an aspirational social and economic secession from USA. Scary
michaelbd	708862373076013056	2016-03-13T03:48:54	ellenbrenna I use the word ecology because I think the causality runs every which way. Bad policy generates breakdown generates bad policy
michaelbd	708862110894309376	2016-03-13T03:47:51	ellenbrenna But, I have no idea.  Or rather, I have only one idea, from hippies: be the change you wish to see. (It’s not easy!)
michaelbd	708861215225806848	2016-03-13T03:44:18	ellenbrenna I think the breakdown of trust in the most intimate parts of our lives makes it harder to trust in wider more abstract ways.
michaelbd	708859897199333376	2016-03-13T03:39:04	ellenbrenna I’m not saying it was perfect! FDR trying to hold his party together.
michaelbd	708859739166351362	2016-03-13T03:38:26	ellenbrenna I simply have no idea how to begin repairing the ecology that produces weak families-weak societies-weak state.
michaelbd	708858859323039744	2016-03-13T03:34:56	ellenbrenna It’s a mess. Even a reactionary like me resents the power employers exercise over most intimate aspects of my family life.
michaelbd	708858614388285440	2016-03-13T03:33:58	ellenbrenna New Deal-Great Society came after immigration restriction. Reagan-Gingrich came after immigration liberalization.
michaelbd	708857994533019653	2016-03-13T03:31:30	ellenbrenna Utah’s recent approach to homelessness was creative and effective for instance.
michaelbd	708857738751778816	2016-03-13T03:30:29	ellenbrenna The trend is worldwide, diverse societies have trouble maintaining the high social trust that expresses itself in safety nets
michaelbd	708857053373136896	2016-03-13T03:27:46	ellenbrenna I wish the great and powerful would look at Utah (or Texas) and ask. “How can we make the old Confederacy more like this?”
michaelbd	708856436550451200	2016-03-13T03:25:19	ellenbrenna A rising number of people feel prevented from contributing to society and even their own lives. The result is despair.
michaelbd	708854923992178688	2016-03-13T03:19:18	ellenbrenna What’s interesting is that Trump is weakest in states that have better than average economies or lots of intact families.
michaelbd	708854573872631809	2016-03-13T03:17:54	ellenbrenna Every Western nation on track for a political revolt from a newly insecure proletariat. It’s more painful in 2-party nations
michaelbd	708854089891893251	2016-03-13T03:15:59	ellenbrenna Talk-radio’s view that their listeners make good customers for gold coins and survival seeds is another form of condescension.

michaelbd	708847382641971200	2016-03-13T02:49:20	conorsen it’s a massive problem. No one has any idea how to reconstitute the party. Still, lots of people know why they aren’t Democrat.

michaelbd	708660040056643584	2016-03-12T14:24:54	@JimbauxsJournal he implied it was law enforcement. But he also thinks judges “sign” bills. So, who knows?
michaelbd	708659104089296896	2016-03-12T14:21:11	Anyway, I see the CPD statement. And Trump is certainly playing it up. But advice  to cancel could have come from Secret Service, I believe.
michaelbd	708657714822569984	2016-03-12T14:15:40	reftpt My question is now whether Secret Service advised him to cancel. They don’t comment on this, I don’t think.
michaelbd	708657132661510144	2016-03-12T14:13:21	Okay so local PD didn’t advise him to stop. Does Secret Service comment on any advice they would give the candidate?

michaelbd	708655431145693185	2016-03-12T14:06:35	My bad. I thought it was implied by the campaign’s statement. Nevermind
michaelbd	708655254305382400	2016-03-12T14:05:53	normative NateSilver538 dandrezner oh! I thought it was implied by his statement of cancellation, my bad.

michaelbd	708493817759064064	2016-03-12T03:24:23	Kyle_Dough “she was asking for it” is a bad defense, even when it is true.
michaelbd	708492976557785088	2016-03-12T03:21:03	smokinjoe it is actually. Trump has fanned violence. Now people interested in participating or being near violence are joining in.
michaelbd	708491085144784896	2016-03-12T03:13:32	Kyle_Dough when most people watching think the protestors created a sense of mayhem to shut down a speech.
michaelbd	708490715236532226	2016-03-12T03:12:04	What we need is to intensify the sense of hysteria. Surely that will help us figure out who to scream at for creating a climate of hysteria.
michaelbd	708484044854534144	2016-03-12T02:45:33	I despise Trump, but I'm still grossed out by the specter of shutting down a political speech. For the avg R voter?

michaelbd	704900491239682048	2016-03-02T05:25:48	politicalmath Oh, so you've come to blame me for this too.
michaelbd	704898650728751104	2016-03-02T05:18:29	If you told US elites in 1990 how rich/politically powerful they'd be in 2016, but there's a tiny risk of fascist backlash. they'd take it.
michaelbd	704897077466275840	2016-03-02T05:12:14	DanFosterType How would you feel if a Black Swan disaster came along and made all your extreme minoritarian opinions seem plausible?
michaelbd	704895617848446979	2016-03-02T05:06:26	jpodhoretz chrislhayes SonnyBunch DouthatNYT JeffreyGoldberg He's just first. He won't be last.
michaelbd	704870302451425282	2016-03-02T03:25:50	Cruz's whole conservative catechism has less appeal than Trump's one statement on stagnating wages.
michaelbd	704894235024166912	2016-03-02T05:00:56	DanFosterType A fellow Conan fan. Listen, it sucks but I've been here since 2004 feeling unable to support the nominee. I'm used to this
michaelbd	704893581828493312	2016-03-02T04:58:20	McCormackJohn  
michaelbd	704891963984756736	2016-03-02T04:51:55	McCormackJohn Not you giving me grief.  But, again, my original tweet was that Rubio's blue collar appeal all theoretical at this point.
michaelbd	704891552636788736	2016-03-02T04:50:17	Hilarious McCormackJohn put me on the record as preferring Rubio win the nom And yet, the grief better directed at his campaign come to me
michaelbd	704890887923482624	2016-03-02T04:47:38	Yes, the pro-Rubio case is, he does slightly better than his polls and with people deciding late (presumably anti-Trump. But not well enough
michaelbd	704890278717554689	2016-03-02T04:45:13	This is still true.  Rubio talks good game and polls well in the general. But no real life evidence in these contests
michaelbd	704890016930078720	2016-03-02T04:44:10	McCormackJohn My specificity was about what has been "proved" so far.
michaelbd	704889869307404290	2016-03-02T04:43:35	McCormackJohn I didn't. But generally in these primary contests Rubio wins the 250k and over crowd. Trump wins those under it, yes?
michaelbd	704889137044783104	2016-03-02T04:40:41	McCormackJohn So, again, still just general election polling. Nothing to do with the actual votes he's getting/not getting now.
michaelbd	704887526490816513	2016-03-02T04:34:17	DouthatNYT DanFosterType  One friend I won't out. But baseballcrank's assertions tonight about upward mobility? C'mon-There's no evidence
michaelbd	704887215244099585	2016-03-02T04:33:02	Hands up, how many people see my Twitter handle and actually think I've caused this disaster?
michaelbd	704886995693260800	2016-03-02T04:32:10	DouthatNYT DanFosterType When I see smart people say MR is as talented as Reagan, or obviously the candidate of the American Dream, c'mon
michaelbd	704886246741450752	2016-03-02T04:29:12	DouthatNYT DanFosterType Yes, I did not say he would. Or compare Rubio in this case to Trump. Just to the hype about Rubio.
michaelbd	704886077232914432	2016-03-02T04:28:31	DanFosterType This is accurate. You aded the Trump comparison in your head.  Sad.
michaelbd	704885904436027393	2016-03-02T04:27:50	DanFosterType My tweet was 100% accurate, and your frustration with ME over Rubio's failures is 100% weird.
michaelbd	704885710931828738	2016-03-02T04:27:04	DanFosterType There is no evidence Rubio is expanding the party or winning blue collar voters- two things cited in his favor.
michaelbd	704885431876362240	2016-03-02T04:25:57	DanFosterType Not in the general no. But Marco Rubio is not running in the general, is he?
michaelbd	704885325848551424	2016-03-02T04:25:32	DanFosterType You really think this is the relevant measure right now?  The general election poll?
michaelbd	704885077902282752	2016-03-02T04:24:33	DanFosterType Only in the GOP it does.
michaelbd	704885024500400130	2016-03-02T04:24:20	DanFosterType Okay, enjoy the relevance of that poll.
michaelbd	704884737144442881	2016-03-02T04:23:12	DanFosterType Yes, it's a shame that Rubio has adopted his mentor's strategy of being willing to lose the primary to win the general.
michaelbd	704884309593858049	2016-03-02T04:21:30	Redstone1111 Concede? 
michaelbd	704884008618954752	2016-03-02T04:20:18	Obviously that was the margin of victory for Trump.  
michaelbd	704883555181142016	2016-03-02T04:18:30	They told me mass immigration would eventually make it impossible for conservative candidates to win national elections.  They were right.
michaelbd	704883153215815685	2016-03-02T04:16:54	Or are we still forbidden from looking at evidence and instead have to debate this as if the candidates were Platonic forms?
michaelbd	704882930984873986	2016-03-02T04:16:01	Can we say the idea that Marco Rubio is the candidate to speak to the blue collar workers and make the party more diverse is still unproven?
michaelbd	704881747775889408	2016-03-02T04:11:19	.jsende DouthatNYT jbarro Maybe it has to do with the increasingly cockamamie "scenarios" his team leaks to the press.
michaelbd	704881397379506176	2016-03-02T04:09:55	The exit polls show that Rubio is the candidate for people who make  $250,000 or more.
michaelbd	704880665376980992	2016-03-02T04:07:01	DouthatNYT jsende jbarro Yes, after going 1 for 14 and being 20 points behind in his home state, skepticism is finally here.
michaelbd	704880262468018177	2016-03-02T04:05:25	j_henry2 Fox News has basically been the Rubio network.
michaelbd	704879604482379777	2016-03-02T04:02:48	jsende It's literally just me and maybe jbarro
michaelbd	704879024414314497	2016-03-02T04:00:30	I was one of the only voices skeptical of "Rubio-mentum" in January. But, sure, the media hated him.
michaelbd	704878484544430080	2016-03-02T03:58:21	baseballcrank Rubio was the one who got all the media momentum out of Iowa, and Ted Cruz WON Iowa
michaelbd	704878401182691329	2016-03-02T03:58:01	baseballcrank Yes Trump got more media. But all summer it was "when will it end?" Rubio's media: "His moment is here, he's about to win!"
michaelbd	704877986546319361	2016-03-02T03:56:22	Gingrich won a state on Super Tuesday too.
michaelbd	704877742509187072	2016-03-02T03:55:24	baseballcrank The idea that the media has been especially unfriendly to Rubio is silly.
michaelbd	704877401357094912	2016-03-02T03:54:03	baseballcrank Yair_Rosenberg A lot of them believe Rubio is going to bring in 2 million immigrants a year to compete with them.
michaelbd	704876775554326529	2016-03-02T03:51:33	baseballcrank Yair_Rosenberg IRL or on Twitter with an anime avatar?
michaelbd	704876428446322688	2016-03-02T03:50:11	baseballcrank Yair_Rosenberg Unlike the conservative movement, TRump's not the one calling for purges.
michaelbd	704875881584582657	2016-03-02T03:48:00	baseballcrank Yair_Rosenberg He's the white collar candidate, upper-management's idea of a "go-getter," no one else is buying him.
michaelbd	704875782942883840	2016-03-02T03:47:37	baseballcrank Yair_Rosenberg If you look at the map, he's the candidate of people for whom upward mobility is already a part of their life
michaelbd	704875148915187712	2016-03-02T03:45:06	Yair_Rosenberg baseballcrank He has a line about it. But I don't think journey from bar to POTUS candidate is as relatable as people think
michaelbd	704874971445727234	2016-03-02T03:44:23	To be fair to me, it has not been in his post-IA, NH, SC, or Super Tuesday speeches, or in his campaign announcement.
michaelbd	704874522130956288	2016-03-02T03:42:36	You're all right to point out there is a line on this in Rubio's stump speech.   Hope the moral victory comforts you
michaelbd	704873930797006849	2016-03-02T03:40:15	Yair_Rosenberg baseballcrank Nope  Just admiration for people who work hard.
michaelbd	704873188568735744	2016-03-02T03:37:18	baseballcrank He failed to do it on these primary nights (still looking for transcript of SC)
michaelbd	704871801327849472	2016-03-02T03:31:47	.MZHemingway Yes One line in some speeches.  Not in his announcement speech. Not in post-primary 'victory' speeches.
michaelbd	704870586380587008	2016-03-02T03:26:58	DrewHampshire Rubio talks about how The American Dream of becoming a highly-regarded politician like him still needs to be possible.
michaelbd	704868472573042688	2016-03-02T03:18:34	A Republican giving even Trump's low level of heartfelt talk about stagnating incomes is powerful thing. Amazing no one else tries it.
michaelbd	704865146473086977	2016-03-02T03:05:21	This is it. This is Trump's best argument, the most deadly. Incomes have stagnated: "why haven't they done anything about it?"
michaelbd	704867026729361409	2016-03-02T03:12:49	Trump is weird and mockable but he's an absolute master at playing the media. this turn to the center was scary convincing
michaelbd	704863283967299585	2016-03-02T02:57:57	Christie keeping his eyes elevated as Trump talks about Mexico paying for the wall.
michaelbd	704862792495591426	2016-03-02T02:56:00	It works too.  
michaelbd	704860680747409410	2016-03-02T02:47:36	The theater of this press conference style Trump event probably helps.

michaelbd	704856816329625600	2016-03-02T02:32:15	Fox is reporting that Rick Scott is going to endorse Trump
michaelbd	704854773451907072	2016-03-02T02:24:08	The bullish Trump case is that he constantly increases his ceiling and out-polls anybody head-to-head.
michaelbd	704854136248991744	2016-03-02T02:21:36	Cruz won TX &amp; OK. Rubio won First Things &amp; The National Review.

michaelbd	704854059963064320	2016-03-02T02:21:18	The anti-Trump case is that he's doing bad with late deciders everywhere. (Mostly because they are choosing among several anti-Trumps).
michaelbd	704853681066352642	2016-03-02T02:19:47	All the GOP has to do tomorrow is restrict the franchise in primaries to people who subscribe to political newsletters. RubioRomp
michaelbd	704853455639355394	2016-03-02T02:18:54	Yes.  
michaelbd	704852366005288960	2016-03-02T02:14:34	I can't believe Cruz camp is saying 'get out'. Doesn't he realize if Rubio got 25% more in every state, he's practically winning?
michaelbd	704851242405785601	2016-03-02T02:10:06	I am no Cruz fan but dude is currently second in the GOP primary and the only one to beat back Trump.
