mmurraypolitics	705479781001908224	2016-03-03T19:47:41	And to think this is just a warm-up for the debate tonight.
mmurraypolitics	705478751585484800	2016-03-03T19:43:36	Is it possible Romney's speech helps Trump? Seems to reinforce Trump &amp; his supporters' view that the party elite is also the enemy.
mmurraypolitics	705475767468236800	2016-03-03T19:31:44	Birther stuff was OK tho.

mmurraypolitics	705472813423931392	2016-03-03T19:20:00	"I could have said, 'Mitt, drop to your knees.'" -- Trump, saying how Romney begged for Trump's endorsement in '12
mmurraypolitics	705467448854716416	2016-03-03T18:58:41	Strategic voting in Ohio and Florida is gonna be like 
mmurraypolitics	705465941702766593	2016-03-03T18:52:42	History repeating itself?  George Romney blasted Goldwater in '64.  Mitt Romney blasting Trump in '16.  
mmurraypolitics	705450359628697600	2016-03-03T17:50:47	Romney speech is fodder for both GOP ads now and Clinton ads in fall against nominee Trump
mmurraypolitics	705441296035479552	2016-03-03T17:14:46	They will make amazing clinton campaign TV ads 
mmurraypolitics	705438565027725312	2016-03-03T17:03:54	Romney by far exceeds Harry Truman’s complaint against JFK 2 weeks before 1960 Democratic convention.
mmurraypolitics	705436523517353984	2016-03-03T16:55:48	What is striking is that Mitt Romney just endorsed the anyone-but-Trump strategy, which leads to a contested convention
mmurraypolitics	705435512056709120	2016-03-03T16:51:47	That Romney didn't address -- or renounce -- accepting Trump's endorsement in '12 (bringing him into GOP tent) undercuts much of speech
mmurraypolitics	705434004795822080	2016-03-03T16:45:47	Theres plenty of evidence Mr Trump is a con-man and a fake - Romney
mmurraypolitics	705433425222696960	2016-03-03T16:43:29	"Trump was even going to have a role on the first night of Romney's 2012 convention... canceled due to a hurricane" 
mmurraypolitics	705433380779757568	2016-03-03T16:43:18	Romney: "Watch by the way how he responds to my speech today."
mmurraypolitics	705433026407350272	2016-03-03T16:41:54	The astonishing thing about this Romney speech is that no one of real stature in the party gave it last September
mmurraypolitics	705432691861286914	2016-03-03T16:40:34	What Trump has done: Mitt Romney just said that Ted Cruz is one of three candidates who should be the Republican presidential nominee.
mmurraypolitics	705432622982434816	2016-03-03T16:40:18	MITT calling for tactical anti-Trump voting: Voters who prefer ANY non-Trump candidate should back whoever strongest foe is in their state
mmurraypolitics	705432356061106176	2016-03-03T16:39:14	Mitt Romney basically says he would vote for whoever it would take to deny Trump a majority of delegates.
mmurraypolitics	705432065949433857	2016-03-03T16:38:05	Romney hitting Trump on econ. "He would be very bad for working Americans and families"   If Trump becomes nom, will be ad fodder for Dems
mmurraypolitics	705431119215390720	2016-03-03T16:34:19	Extraordinary when you think about it -- a party's former presidential nominee taking on his party's frontrunner, even after Super Tues
mmurraypolitics	705428348252643332	2016-03-03T16:23:19	Trump in '12: "Mitt is tough, he's smart, he's sharp, he's not going to allow bad things to continue to happen" 
mmurraypolitics	705428452120383488	2016-03-03T16:23:43	The Supreme Court fight now has some even higher stakes 
mmurraypolitics	705426845764870149	2016-03-03T16:17:20	Wow 
mmurraypolitics	705417798885900288	2016-03-03T15:41:23	not terribly surprising, but Rubio camp concedes they went hard in Minn/Va to get a symbolic win, not for delegates 
mmurraypolitics	705417236295651328	2016-03-03T15:39:09	I was there when Mitt Romney accepted Donald Trump's endorsement in 2012. It was surreal:

mmurraypolitics	705405869635325952	2016-03-03T14:53:59	Mission Possible? The Chance to Stop Trump Is Real 
mmurraypolitics	705403369167392768	2016-03-03T14:44:03	Coming soon: Full blown GOP chaos. Contested convention plus no action on Supreme Court:  
mmurraypolitics	705401474084380672	2016-03-03T14:36:31	ElectProject CPAC coverage is greater in off-years; less in the midst of presidential primary season.
mmurraypolitics	705400315764408322	2016-03-03T14:31:55	"She was very, very wrong [on trade support]. And millions of Americans have suffered under those trade agreements."

mmurraypolitics	705394347060101121	2016-03-03T14:08:12	understand Romney's desire to speak out, but he may have helped party more by raising $30M or so last year to stop trump.
mmurraypolitics	705393888631132160	2016-03-03T14:06:23	Would also ensure that the rough back-and-forth we've seen over past week would last another FOUR-plus months 
mmurraypolitics	705392700871340032	2016-03-03T14:01:40	Cruz's YUGE delegate haul from Texas (Cruz 103, Trump 46, Rubio 5) has kept delegate race closer than expected 
mmurraypolitics	705391433675632640	2016-03-03T13:56:37	This is what I've been trying to convey when people say "Oh Trump didn't win much." He changed the entire landscape. 
mmurraypolitics	705388105872834561	2016-03-03T13:43:24	Mitt Romney and the GOP’s original sin when it comes to Donald Trump 
mmurraypolitics	705387067585396736	2016-03-03T13:39:17	I honestly don't see what good could come from Romney giving a speech criticizing Trump. Maybe there's something I'm missing??
mmurraypolitics	705386795387723776	2016-03-03T13:38:12	Fact is, Trump needs a win in either FL or OH -- just as much as his rivals do 
mmurraypolitics	705386382051688448	2016-03-03T13:36:33	Chance to stop Trump is real -- whether it's Trump's smaller-than-expected delegate lead or the upcoming calendar 
mmurraypolitics	705385260939345920	2016-03-03T13:32:06	So the theory is that the people Romney is calling “suckers” for already voting for Trump won’t mind? 
mmurraypolitics	705385581002379264	2016-03-03T13:33:22	For all the bluster, Trumpcare is basically the same as any other GOP Obamacare repeal plan. 
mmurraypolitics	705373170895818752	2016-03-03T12:44:03	Hoping MittRomney will answer this question in his speech: 
mmurraypolitics	705362481422704646	2016-03-03T12:01:35	Has a point here 
mmurraypolitics	705359977158983681	2016-03-03T11:51:38	Was four years ago when Romney accepted Trump's endorsement, fully bringing him into GOP tent after birther crusade 
mmurraypolitics	705124247526641665	2016-03-02T20:14:55	On another planet, this Trump quote starred in $20m of ads in November  
mmurraypolitics	705152383932829700	2016-03-02T22:06:44	This seems like smarter politics than picking a GOP governor for SCOTUS:

mmurraypolitics	705142265405169666	2016-03-02T21:26:31	DLeonhardt Due almost entirely to performance in Texas, where he's won 103 out of state's 155 delegates

mmurraypolitics	705139988179058688	2016-03-02T21:17:28	This means Sanders needs to win 59% of the remaining delegates to hit magic 2,383 number  Clinton needs to win 41% 
mmurraypolitics	705138767364026368	2016-03-02T21:12:37	Updated: Clinton has 161-delegate lead over Sanders from Super Tues alone, 498 vs. 337.  Overall (with supers): Clinton 1017 Sanders 424
