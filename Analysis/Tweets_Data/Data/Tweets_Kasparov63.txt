Kasparov63	722133381450973184	2016-04-18T18:43:09	But turning to authoritarianism (or socialism) to solve the problems of democracy and the free market is committing suicide to cure a flu.

Kasparov63	721742079009939456	2016-04-17T16:48:15	Every time Trump speaks is another example and it's not as if he doesn't received adequate media coverage!

Kasparov63	721473659693633536	2016-04-16T23:01:39	If they admit reality, they would have to act. By pretending Putin's crimes are only 99.9% certain, from Litvinenko to MH17, they can hide.
Kasparov63	721473043332231169	2016-04-16T22:59:12	Putin's lies are ignored by Western leaders because they are convenient to them too. From my book, Winter is Coming:

Kasparov63	698217787039354880	2016-02-12T18:51:07	The risk of a war comes when one side believes it can win, esp with little risk. Appeasement creates this belief. Deterrence reduces it.
Kasparov63	698217170875056130	2016-02-12T18:48:40	Putin wouldn't be in Syria had the West stood up to him in Ukraine. Wouldn't have gone into Ukraine had he been punished for Georgia. Etc.
Kasparov63	698216735615422464	2016-02-12T18:46:56	No, that's the coward's fallacy. The best way to avoid big conflicts is to stand up in small ones. Deterrence works. 
Kasparov63	698216042510864384	2016-02-12T18:44:11	Putin is more dangerous than Stalin in 1946, when Truman stood up to Communist expansion at great military, economic, &amp; political risk? No.
Kasparov63	698215625848700932	2016-02-12T18:42:32	We must look at US, EU, NATO as future generations will: a rich &amp; unrivaled force quietly watching innocents enslaved &amp; murdered worldwide.
Kasparov63	698214532582400000	2016-02-12T18:38:11	Yes, politely ask murderers to help by not murdering anymore. Great strategy! US &amp; EU are complicit in this slaughter by their inaction.
Kasparov63	698213816778235904	2016-02-12T18:35:20	Russia &amp; Assad openly massacre civilians &amp; create countless refugees. Yet West still talks about wanting Russia to "help", pretty please.
Kasparov63	698212688422424584	2016-02-12T18:30:51	Putin's so-called ceasefires always occur after he's gotten what he wants by force. US &amp; NATO are a disgrace to keep going along.

Kasparov63	696444997986549761	2016-02-07T21:26:41	As for why having big ideas about right and wrong really matters, my post on Kissinger, Putin (and Reagan!): 
Kasparov63	696444335139786753	2016-02-07T21:24:03	Social issues far from my expertise I'm eager to say. But the govt usually follows the people on them, doesn't lead.

Kasparov63	696442618151096320	2016-02-07T21:17:14	Yes, at least Sanders is sincere. But Socialists never tell you that "two chickens in every pot" means we all divide the same two chickens!

Kasparov63	696440183034609664	2016-02-07T21:07:33	If the GOP nominates someone who can't do better than "Obama is Bad!" they will be crushed by Hillary's "More of the Same!" &amp; act surprised.

Kasparov63	696439419822325761	2016-02-07T21:04:31	People need to see how &amp; why Obama has achieved &amp; why his goals are bad for US &amp; world. Big topic, not soundbites! Rubio trying to explain.
Kasparov63	696438636020105217	2016-02-07T21:01:24	"Obama knows what he's doing" made sense immediately. Don't pretend his success is an accident. He was elected &amp; reelected. Fight on ideas!
Kasparov63	696437846333353985	2016-02-07T20:58:16	I also assumed the Obama admin was simply naive &amp; incompetent. But has become clear Obama sees US power as bad &amp; reducing it is his goal.
Kasparov63	696437183377514496	2016-02-07T20:55:38	Of course. Maybe Rubio repeated himself because idiots don't seem to understand what he meant! Was clear to me. 
Kasparov63	696408257863221248	2016-02-07T19:00:41	Banners are nice. But boots on the ground in Syria and Ukraine are better to blunt Putin's jingoism.

Kasparov63	695698516241424386	2016-02-05T20:00:26	Kissinger's idea to cede a Russian sphere of influence to Putin is similar to his pitch to Bush 41 in Dec 88 w Reagan leaving. Amazing.

Kasparov63	695636904172220416	2016-02-05T15:55:36	Meanwhile, Sanders simply seems to believe that foreign policy is irrelevant – to him &amp; to voters. This is also dangerous, of course.
Kasparov63	695636049729425409	2016-02-05T15:52:13	Hillary has foreign policy experience, yes, in admin watching global security &amp; freedom drop as it appeases dictatorships &amp; abandons allies.

Kasparov63	694380439000215557	2016-02-02T04:42:52	This is taking forever. The convenience of elections in Russia is that they can announce the results well in advance.
Kasparov63	694377833704087552	2016-02-02T04:32:31	Yes, a Rubio-Kasich ticket would be formidable, with a plausible claim to Florida and Ohio right off the bat.
