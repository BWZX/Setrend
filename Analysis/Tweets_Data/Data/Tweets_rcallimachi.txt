rcallimachi	720368745395331072	2016-04-13T21:51:07	AlFinlandi Yup, I saw it. Thanks. Am joining a list of colleagues now mentioned by him.
rcallimachi	720368565291855872	2016-04-13T21:50:24	Here are the two photos I compared and contrasted today from today's Dabiq and from Dabiq after Paris attacks: 
rcallimachi	720367992588996610	2016-04-13T21:48:07	Rather than just tweeting, I also had the chance to storify my thoughts on ISIS' electronic archive of attackers 
rcallimachi	720257823653781505	2016-04-13T14:30:21	The network of the Islamic State in Europe is quietly sitting since months in an electronic archive stored somewhere 
rcallimachi	720253735541321728	2016-04-13T14:14:06	16. Notice picture of Laachraoui in ISIS magazine matches those of Paris attackers appearing in post-Paris video 
rcallimachi	720243559341899777	2016-04-13T13:33:40	GunnarHrafnJ Yes he went to Syria, but I am focusing on the Brussels attackers. He was killed in a shootout preceding the attack
rcallimachi	720242365571690496	2016-04-13T13:28:56	15. Errata: Raniaab points out that Absi's group was independent. bentaub91 reported they trained at same base, but remained distinct
rcallimachi	720236555005202432	2016-04-13T13:05:50	fragezeichen95 Yes, read my story "The horror before the beheadings."
rcallimachi	720236437665398784	2016-04-13T13:05:22	14. &amp; before anyone makes fun of the dream sequence, just remember: dreams are a big deal in jihadi ideology. Seen as prophetic instruments
rcallimachi	720236123637858304	2016-04-13T13:04:07	13. By mentioning Adnani, even if he only appears in a dream, it appears ISIS is positioning Brussels attack as under external ops' command
rcallimachi	720235753175953409	2016-04-13T13:02:39	12. I wrote at length about the long arm of ISIS' operations branch last month, including Adnani's role as its head: 
rcallimachi	720235213515845632	2016-04-13T13:00:30	11. In dream, attacker encounters Adnani, the ISIS spokesman &amp; crucially the head of the branch inside ISIS dedicated to external attacks
rcallimachi	720234894970986497	2016-04-13T12:59:14	10. The dream foreshadows attack. Whether he actually had this dream is of course unknown. Of interest is mention of Abu Muhammad al-Adnani
rcallimachi	720234072551907329	2016-04-13T12:55:58	9. It says that the Bakraoui brothers radicalized in jail in Europe. In a long sequence they describe a dream that 1 of the brothers had
rcallimachi	720233847527510017	2016-04-13T12:55:05	8. Of equal interest to me is that magazine reveals (via omission) that neither of the Bakraoui brothers travelled to Syria. I wasn't sure.
rcallimachi	720233483164114944	2016-04-13T12:53:38	7. A battalion which became a magnet for foreign fighters, esp Belgians - &amp; among this group, he was among 1st to pledge allegiance to ISIS
rcallimachi	720233251881803777	2016-04-13T12:52:43	6. This is a way to ascertain his pedigree: Not only was Najim the Brussels' bombmaker he also traces his ISIS lineage to a famous battalion
rcallimachi	720232930845528065	2016-04-13T12:51:26	5. The magazine states that Najim was among the first members of Absi's group to break with Nusra Front and pledge allegiance to ISIS
rcallimachi	720232788767727616	2016-04-13T12:50:52	4. And it was Absi's battalion that initially held the Western hostages, including James Foley, John Cantlie and a German hostage
rcallimachi	720232579895599104	2016-04-13T12:50:02	3. As @bentaub9 reported in his excellent piece, Absi's battalion was funnel through which Belgian jihadists passed 
rcallimachi	720232163887685632	2016-04-13T12:48:23	2. The magazine explains Najim left for Syria and initially joined Absi's group, a battalion initially under Nusra Front before joining ISIS
rcallimachi	720231781706907648	2016-04-13T12:46:52	1. New issue of ISIS magazine is out, inc bio of Brussels attackers. Of interest is that only Najim Lachraoui seems to have gone to Syria

rcallimachi	719225085404569600	2016-04-10T18:06:37	rcallimachi this account isn't 3-4 people from Baghdadi's inner circle. This is by far the most dangerous ISIS propaganda account around.
rcallimachi	719217069208637440	2016-04-10T17:34:46	kranzman Question is - why isn't Twitter creating an algorithm to block his account? It's always TurM or TurMed or TurMedi plus a number
rcallimachi	719216876425904129	2016-04-10T17:34:00	kranzman Because he is on his 493rd account and is considered a major touchstone in the ISIS community. He uses the same username formula

rcallimachi	719215868929028097	2016-04-10T17:30:00	10. From someone who spends his days hunting these accounts : 
rcallimachi	719215499666661376	2016-04-10T17:28:32	9. And it's been suspended. It was live for over 1 hour garnering close to 1700 followers. Why is this possible? 
rcallimachi	719214745727995904	2016-04-10T17:25:32	8. People who spend their days trying to shut down terror accounts have discovered a hole: Twitter's doesn't seem to be staffed on weekends
rcallimachi	719214403359547392	2016-04-10T17:24:10	7. A colleague following the account sent me this screengrab showing he now has over 1600 followers: 
rcallimachi	719214117945524224	2016-04-10T17:23:02	6. Acct is still live but he's now blocked me (I don't blame him). How long account is allowed to live will test Twitter's weekend presence
rcallimachi	719213418939617284	2016-04-10T17:20:16	5. He's showing how he can continuously recreate new accounts, with only slight variations in username right under Twitter's digital nose
rcallimachi	719213089560915968	2016-04-10T17:18:57	4. His nomenclature for naming accounts, with each one stating number of previous suspensions is almost an "f.. you" to Twitter
rcallimachi	719212433231998979	2016-04-10T17:16:21	3. Account has been live for 1 hour &amp; already has 1,000+ followers. It again uses same profile picture as before in a predictable pattern
rcallimachi	719212145465028608	2016-04-10T17:15:12	2. Once again he is using a predictable combination of letters starting with TurM plus 493, denoting the number of his latest account
rcallimachi	719211922760081408	2016-04-10T17:14:19	1. Hi folks, remember TurM491, the ISIS propagandist whose account stayed open for hours last week? He's back

rcallimachi	718550360017760261	2016-04-08T21:25:30	JohnArterbury There are more missing in Syria, but I don't believe in Assad's hands (numerous other armed groups present on battlefield)
rcallimachi	718549973235863554	2016-04-08T21:23:58	19. Following the US' failure to save any of the four Americans held by ISIS (James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller)
rcallimachi	718549527331016704	2016-04-08T21:22:11	18. Same source says Dawes' release is the first "win" for Obama's hostage envoy Jim O'Brien, a position created as part of hostage review
rcallimachi	718549297738989569	2016-04-08T21:21:17	17. The communication channel involved Czechs, Russians, the Lebanese and of course the U.S., led by Kerry and Obama's new hostage czar
rcallimachi	718549045392879616	2016-04-08T21:20:17	16. Same source, who'se been involved in other hostage releases, says that the Syrians used an intermediary (likely the Czechs) to reach out
rcallimachi	718548836445253632	2016-04-08T21:19:27	15. Regarding how he got out, a source close to the Lebanese government briefed on his release says Syrians began floating idea in 2015
rcallimachi	718548390393602048	2016-04-08T21:17:40	14. Exhibit A from another person who claims he interacted with Dawes at the Syria border: 
rcallimachi	718547720139579396	2016-04-08T21:15:01	13. His release raises hopes for last American hostage believed to be held by the Syrian regime - Austin Tice, who has been missing for yrs
rcallimachi	718547474357596160	2016-04-08T21:14:02	12. It goes without saying that everyone is relieved he made it out alive. Many thought he was already dead including EliotHiggins
rcallimachi	718547131448090627	2016-04-08T21:12:40	11 We know Assad regime tortures captives/accuses them of being CIA. What would they do to someone claiming he was being followed by CIA?
rcallimachi	718546722553741312	2016-04-08T21:11:03	10. Given mental health challenges he displayed to EliotHiggins and others before his abduction, I can't imagine what state he is in now
rcallimachi	718546417913110529	2016-04-08T21:09:50	9. He alternatively told EliotHiggins he wanted to go to Syria to document war/bring aid. He had plans for bringing down helicopters
rcallimachi	718546026643210240	2016-04-08T21:08:17	8. Dawes is described as a "freelance photographer" on the FBI notice. Those who interacted w him say he oscillates between different roles
rcallimachi	718545577546489857	2016-04-08T21:06:30	8. He was becoming increasingly paranoid. Last message he sent EliotHiggins accused him of "being a CIA drone." He disappeared the next day
rcallimachi	718545188034109440	2016-04-08T21:04:57	7. There he began sending EliotHiggins hundreds of messages, including 150 Twitter DMs in one day, each increasingly unhinged
rcallimachi	718545011206406145	2016-04-08T21:04:15	6. Out of concern, EliotHiggins went so far as to contact the FBI tip line regarding Dawes. Soon after Dawes headed to the Syria border
rcallimachi	718544790833520641	2016-04-08T21:03:22	5. EliotHiggins became concerned for Dawes when he went back to America &amp; began ranting about how his gun rights had been taken away
rcallimachi	718544463002476544	2016-04-08T21:02:04	4. EliotHiggins says that even then - in 2011 - Dawes was exhibiting signs of mental illness. "He was not 100%," he told me
rcallimachi	718544291988180992	2016-04-08T21:01:23	3. See the interview EliotHiggins did in 2011 with Dawes, regarding his experiences in Libya here: 
rcallimachi	718543996197453824	2016-04-08T21:00:13	2. I caught up with EliotHiggins by phone today and he shared how he first reached out to Dawes in 2011 and interviewed him for his blog
rcallimachi	718543766680944641	2016-04-08T20:59:18	1. Just about the last person to speak to Kevin Dawes before he disappeared in Syria 4 yrs ago was EliotHiggins, then of Brown Moses blog
rcallimachi	718541523764310016	2016-04-08T20:50:23	Kevin Dawes has been released by Syrian regime. Those who knew him described him as suffering from mental illness 
rcallimachi	718506544380452864	2016-04-08T18:31:24	4. Instead, there seemed to be more military propaganda (raids, air defence &amp; attrition), and increasing numbers of wildlife photographs.
rcallimachi	718506280684531713	2016-04-08T18:30:21	3. While both are still very much present, the propagandists' focus on the civilian life &amp; victimhood narratives diminished over time.
rcallimachi	718506179253661697	2016-04-08T18:29:56	2. Here are some (very) preliminary observations, in no particular order.
rcallimachi	718505995396374529	2016-04-08T18:29:13	1. Just finished looking through each of the 6,398 official IS propaganda photographs that were released between 01/12/15 &amp; 01/04/16.

rcallimachi	715930541204353025	2016-04-01T15:55:17	Once again, ISIS reiterates its position that journalists, reporting facts, are "enemy combatants." 
rcallimachi	715930108696068096	2016-04-01T15:53:33	_sakkora_ nytimes You have no evidence there were civilians in that mosque. In Hasaka, after airstrike, the bodies we found all had arms

rcallimachi	715253282936070144	2016-03-30T19:04:06	ErrataRob Why do you think the French judiciary tried to get the DGSI to impersonate Hame via TrueCrypt if they didn't have the logon?
rcallimachi	715253072960831488	2016-03-30T19:03:16	ErrataRob That you would conclude there is no "TrueCrypt login credentials" based on "excerpts" is indicative of the tenor of your work

rcallimachi	715251825964937216	2016-03-30T18:58:18	ErrataRob What Aug 13 interview? Do you not understand that Hame was interrogated for nearly 17 hrs over multiple days?

rcallimachi	714912562459119617	2016-03-29T20:30:11	71/ Official says he doesn't know whether the DGSI followed through, but is pessimistic that they followed his instructions.
rcallimachi	714912401179742208	2016-03-29T20:29:33	70/Idea would have been to impersonate Hame &amp; try to leave encrypted folders in  in order to communicate with Abaaoud
rcallimachi	714912133079777282	2016-03-29T20:28:29	69/ Among examples of missed opportunities for the French: Senior judiciary source told me he begged the DGSI to use Hame's Truecrypt logon
rcallimachi	714910558408073216	2016-03-29T20:22:14	68/ Figured out that Hame had been picked up and that officials were now focusing on Truecrypt as a mode of communication for the group.
rcallimachi	714910270443880448	2016-03-29T20:21:05	67. And we know that in September 2015, Abaaoud's team of 10 attackers begins beaching on Europe's shores. It remains unknown if his cell
rcallimachi	714910117112766470	2016-03-29T20:20:28	66/ 1 thing to keep in mind: When Hame was picked up in August 2015, his arrest wasn't leaked to the press. It was kept under wraps
rcallimachi	714909407289733121	2016-03-29T20:17:39	65/ They were using a program like TrueCrypt and then uploading the encrypted folder onto a website like 
rcallimachi	714909167807557632	2016-03-29T20:16:42	64/ Rather it means one of two things: Either they didn't send electronic communications of any kind, *or* as we see from Hame's record they
rcallimachi	714907697456525315	2016-03-29T20:10:52	63/ This is *not* (as many incorrectly attempted to conclude) because the use of encryption "disappeared" the messages of the attackers
rcallimachi	714907436906364930	2016-03-29T20:09:49	62/ of intercepted emails/messages suggest encryption? This is assertion of officials who believe Paris/Brussels attackers used encryption
rcallimachi	714906906171744256	2016-03-29T20:07:43	61/ Re my earlier article based on a French National Police report on the Paris attacks, many of you wanted to know, why does absence
rcallimachi	714903728021614593	2016-03-29T19:55:05	.nytimes correspondent rcallimachi discusses ISIS &amp; its efforts to carry out attacks in Europe at 4:10 pm. Listen: 
rcallimachi	714904112983371776	2016-03-29T19:56:37	60/ While I can't say for sure, the description in the file, makes it sound as if French intel was not able to decrypt those files
rcallimachi	714903921857282048	2016-03-29T19:55:51	59/ "They are respectively entitled 418-f0005768" and "419-f0006312." This is in a summary presented to France's judiciary post-Nov 13
rcallimachi	714903519250292736	2016-03-29T19:54:15	59/ They describe a tab found inside Hame's Truecrypt program entitled, "Plain Text" and add it "appears to contain two encrypted files"
rcallimachi	714902914112819200	2016-03-29T19:51:51	58/ Interestingly, the French DGSI agency's record of what was found on Hame's USB stick includes a description of 2 encrypted files
rcallimachi	714902564396015616	2016-03-29T19:50:28	57/ And even if they hand them over, can the file encrypted by TrueCrypt be read?
rcallimachi	714902134861520896	2016-03-29T19:48:45	56/ Correct me if I'm wrong, but could an act of Congress in America have any impact on whether or not a Turkish company hands over records?
rcallimachi	714901868103802880	2016-03-29T19:47:42	55/ While server of stocking website may be hosted in France, the company itself is Turkish (according to the French intelligence record).
rcallimachi	714901580772933632	2016-03-29T19:46:33	54/ 2nd point: Debate in Congress regarding encryption appears to me to not be relevant to what ISIS is doing bc the tools are not American
rcallimachi	714901142141083648	2016-03-29T19:44:49	53/ He was supposed to memorize logon and destroy paper but he apparently forgot &amp; so when he was picked up in Paris, officials found logon
rcallimachi	714900840918687744	2016-03-29T19:43:37	52/ First even when encryption is used by a terror group, possibility of human error looms large. For example, Hame wrote down logon details
rcallimachi	714900459702644737	2016-03-29T19:42:06	51/ Hi everyone, I am briefly back and wanted to keep going on the encryption issue: What Reda Hame's interrogation shows is 3-fold:
rcallimachi	714894973431386113	2016-03-29T19:20:18	GeorgeBluff Yes, that is what my Tweet says.

rcallimachi	714868570036035585	2016-03-29T17:35:23	rcallimachi SCREENSHOTS - Feb 2016, IS tech support team recommended Veracrypt as patch for flaws with Truecrypt. 
rcallimachi	714860139648516097	2016-03-29T17:01:53	50/ I need to take a break in order to answer questions on the Times' Facebook page. Join us at the following link: 
rcallimachi	714859478806634501	2016-03-29T16:59:15	49/ On a pro-ISIS Telegram channel, suspected ISIS members were recently promoting VeraCrypt, a later version of TrueCrypt
rcallimachi	714859186182615041	2016-03-29T16:58:06	48/ Is TrueCrypt what Paris/Brussels attackers used? No one knows for sure but investigators believe it was TrueCrypt or something similar
rcallimachi	714858487050870786	2016-03-29T16:55:19	48/Secondly they don't trust Western-made applications &amp; for good reason: the Yahoo drafts were backdoor because officials could go to Yahoo
rcallimachi	714858122809118720	2016-03-29T16:53:52	47/ It seems that ISIS was worried about metadata tracking, and for that reason was advising operatives not to email anything, only upload
rcallimachi	714857980311834626	2016-03-29T16:53:18	46/The twist is twofold. 1) The message is inside an encrypted folder, whereas al-Qaeda's were unencrypted; 2) website is not Western-owned
rcallimachi	714857460599754754	2016-03-29T16:51:14	45/ Counterterror experts who reviewed this protocol tell me it reminds them of what al-Qaeda did for yrs: Saving "drafts" in Yahoo inboxes
rcallimachi	714857219716681730	2016-03-29T16:50:17	44/ Hame describes the Turkish website as "a dead inbox." He said his ISIS handler would then check website &amp; download encrypted folder
rcallimachi	714856993362681856	2016-03-29T16:49:23	43/ to upload the encrypted folder to a Turkish stocking website called . Basically he was *not* to email it
rcallimachi	714856707944488962	2016-03-29T16:48:15	42/ ... "you choose the mode of encryption." Then once the message is in the folder and the folder is encrypted, the instructions he had was
rcallimachi	714856456584097794	2016-03-29T16:47:15	41/ ..."You need to create a folder inside, where you place your text. You choose the size you want to send &amp; in ribbon unfurling at bottom
rcallimachi	714856021714472961	2016-03-29T16:45:31	40/ Here is a verbatim what Hame said. After putting the USB key containing Truecrypt in the laptop,"You need to open the program ...
rcallimachi	714854906780327937	2016-03-29T16:41:05	39/ In June 2015, he was taken to a cybercafe in Raqqa by one of ISIS' IT professionals and handed a USB stick containing TrueCrypt
rcallimachi	714854702920417280	2016-03-29T16:40:17	38/ TrueCrypt is a widely available encryption program, which experts tell me has notbeen cracked. Hame describes the tutorial he received
rcallimachi	714851094049005568	2016-03-29T16:25:56	37/ At his mother's apartment in Paris after his arrest in August 2015, authorities recover a USB stick containing TrueCrypt
rcallimachi	714850762975784960	2016-03-29T16:24:37	36/ Hame is the first credible data point that we have regarding the kind of encryption that the terror group uses to mask its communication
rcallimachi	714847077839335424	2016-03-29T16:09:59	35/ Although many operatives were interrogated by the French, officials told me that  Hame stood out: Of all the recruits he shared the most
rcallimachi	714846797676617728	2016-03-29T16:08:52	34/ In Syria for only a week, he undergoes accelerated training, overseen by Abaaoud. This is June 2015, 4 mos before the Paris attacks
rcallimachi	714846395488972800	2016-03-29T16:07:16	33/ He wants to join ISIS to fight Assad, but instead is immediately routed into a pipeline for attacks on Europe, he tells interrogators
rcallimachi	714846115250716672	2016-03-29T16:06:09	33/ Reda Hame grows up in a chic Parisian neighborhood and is an IT specialist for a subsidiary of Airbus. He goes to Syria in June 2015
rcallimachi	714843842135072769	2016-03-29T15:57:07	31/ What we also know is that ISIS was simultaneously planning small, medium and big-sized attacks at the same time: 
rcallimachi	714843682625757185	2016-03-29T15:56:29	30/ External Operations Branch of ISIS is responsible for recruiting, vetting &amp; training operatives for attacks in Europe.
rcallimachi	714836249777938432	2016-03-29T15:26:57	29/ This body prioritized striking Europe. It is under the command-and-control of Adnani. Among Adnani's deputies was Abaaoud
rcallimachi	714835788970778625	2016-03-29T15:25:07	28/ From their interrogations what emerges is the following: Starting in 2014 a body took shape inside ISIS dedicated to external operations
rcallimachi	714835151851823104	2016-03-29T15:22:35	27/ That is a conservative number and is based only on the interrogation records I could secure, which are only a portion of what exists
rcallimachi	714834896603242497	2016-03-29T15:21:34	26/ In total, I counted 21 fighters (almost all French/Belgian) who trained in Syria and returned to Europe 2014-2016 to carry out terror
rcallimachi	714834552154374144	2016-03-29T15:20:12	25/ They explain they were ordered to carry out external attacks by Abu Muhammad al Adnani himself, spokesman of ISIS and a senior member
rcallimachi	714834323854254080	2016-03-29T15:19:18	24/ June 2014 is when ISIS declares caliphate. Same month 2 more French operatives are arrested in Lebanon and France. Key details emerge
rcallimachi	714833841836466176	2016-03-29T15:17:23	23/ Abdelhamid Abaaou is Belgian operative who is architect of Paris attacks. Starting in March 2014 many of the returnees are linked to him
rcallimachi	714832667217420288	2016-03-29T15:12:43	22/ By then though ties to ISIS hierarchy are explicit: Months before museum attack, officials intercept call between Nemmouche &amp; Abaaoud
rcallimachi	714832133127278592	2016-03-29T15:10:36	21/ In what will become a pattern, officials downplay ties to ISIS, reassure public saying he "probably acted alone" even after finding flag
rcallimachi	714831545173983232	2016-03-29T15:08:15	20/ Just a month after Boudina's arrest, ISIS operative Mehdi Nemmouche returns to Europe in March 2014. He kills 4 ppl at Jewish Museum
rcallimachi	714831097205493760	2016-03-29T15:06:29	19/ It remains unclear if Boudina was sent by ISIS, or proposed mission himself. What is clear is his case has many of the later hallmarks
rcallimachi	714827479991652352	2016-03-29T14:52:06	18/ Mind you we're talking about 2014, 2 yrs before Brussels &amp; already an ISIS operative has figured out how to get into Europe &amp; cook TATP
rcallimachi	714826373269835776	2016-03-29T14:47:42	17/ But in how Boudina is described, no mention of ISIS: He's an "extremist." It's not until months later that you find it in court file
rcallimachi	714824530955476992	2016-03-29T14:40:23	16/ On his laptop, they find keyword searches indicating he was planning an attack either on a French military base or on a carnival parade
rcallimachi	714823895749160960	2016-03-29T14:37:52	15/ They stake out his apartment just up the coast from Cannes and nab him on Feb 11, 2014. In a utility closet they find 3 TATP bombs
rcallimachi	714823781613756421	2016-03-29T14:37:24	14/ 2nd friend advises 1st to hold off, saying some people "survive" these things. The French by now are sure Boudina is planning an attack
rcallimachi	714823676772933634	2016-03-29T14:36:59	13/ They also intercept calls to Boudina's friends, one of whom is calling the other to fret about how to break "the news" to Boudina's mom
rcallimachi	714822732416991234	2016-03-29T14:33:14	12/ Several weeks later the French intercept call to Boudina's mom from a caller in Syria who tells her her son "has been sent on a mission"
rcallimachi	714822424391524353	2016-03-29T14:32:01	11/ There is no warrant for Boudina's arrest and so the Greeks let him go, though they alert France. The French begin wiretapping his mom
rcallimachi	714822116676354048	2016-03-29T14:30:48	10/ A crucial detail for what is to come: The manual shows step-by-step how to make explosives out of triacetone triperoxide, or TATP
rcallimachi	714821601561350145	2016-03-29T14:28:45	9/ Greek police find 1500 euros and a USB stick containing a bomb making manual entitled: "How to Make Artisanal Bombs in the Name of Allah"
rcallimachi	714821201483468802	2016-03-29T14:27:09	8/ He joins Nusra, then ISIS, and in Dec 2013 he begins his return journey to Europe, and is stopped in Greece at 12:10 pm on Jan 3, 2014
rcallimachi	714820741687062528	2016-03-29T14:25:20	7/ The first data point I have is a man named Ibrahim Boudina, who grew up on France's scenic Côte d'Azur, yet who goes to Syria circa 2012
rcallimachi	714820298705616898	2016-03-29T14:23:34	6/ Months before they declared a caliphate, when they were still under the umbrella of Al Qaeda, ISIS began sending operatives to Europe
rcallimachi	714819829463654400	2016-03-29T14:21:42	5/ The research I have done, based on 100s of pages of court documents &amp; interrogation records, indicates that this is dead wrong.
rcallimachi	714819373903572992	2016-03-29T14:19:54	4/ Officials &amp; analysts have argued that ever since group declared a caliphate in June 2014, their main preoccupation has been governing
rcallimachi	714819091253608448	2016-03-29T14:18:46	3/ The accepted wisdom regarding ISIS is that, unlike Al-Qaeda, which always aimed to hit the "far enemy," ISIS was focused on "near enemy"
rcallimachi	714818420513062915	2016-03-29T14:16:06	2/ I plan to first discuss data on how ISIS began sending fighters to Europe. Then I'll cover training they received including encryption

rcallimachi	712422873860861953	2016-03-22T23:37:03	Lapps100 I just want people to understand the scale. The chances of you or someone you know dying in one of these is very low.
rcallimachi	712422542804434946	2016-03-22T23:35:45	Cab driver who led police to the Schaerbeek flat recalled bombers wouldn't let him help them with their luggage v 
rcallimachi	712421249499205634	2016-03-22T23:30:36	49. This doesn't diminish the horror of what happened on 3/22 &amp; 11/13, but let's not make this bigger than it is = awful but rare occurences
rcallimachi	712420794111016961	2016-03-22T23:28:48	48. In France, 760 ppl died in car crashes last year. You'd need a Nov 13 every other month to match that: 
rcallimachi	712420439444873216	2016-03-22T23:27:23	47. Some statistics: 160 ppl died in car wrecks in Belgium in 2015. You'd have to have 1 attack like one today every 2.5 mos to match that
rcallimachi	712419966847426560	2016-03-22T23:25:30	46 Troubled by # of ppl saying they're scared after reading my thread. Terror attacks are awful, but chances of being affected are next 2nil
rcallimachi	712418683465900033	2016-03-22T23:20:24	bkamatya Of the 10 attackers who carried out the Paris carnage, 8 were European citizens. The threat is from within

rcallimachi	712384072321011712	2016-03-22T21:02:52	45. Sidenote: I will be on Charlie Rose shortly discussing Brussels and editors are putting out my analysis on photo of bombers/explosives
rcallimachi	712383504168914948	2016-03-22T21:00:37	44 As someone who has frequently been flagged for overweight luggage, I can say with certainty bag 3rd suspect is carrying can hold 100+ lbs
rcallimachi	712382514766155778	2016-03-22T20:56:41	43. In Paris, bombs were in suicide belts which can hold roughly 1 pound of TATP. A suitcase can hold 100 pounds or more.
rcallimachi	712382114579267584	2016-03-22T20:55:06	42. Latest from AFP quotes officials saying bombs were in attackers' suitcases. This explains why the blast was visibly stronger than Paris
rcallimachi	712381843341975553	2016-03-22T20:54:01	41. ISIS is now promoting pictures showing fighters handing out sweets in Syria to celebrate Brussels attack (Source: siteintelgroup )

rcallimachi	712243079638589440	2016-03-22T11:42:37	I miss the days when the first response from presidential candidates to disaster was to offer thoughts and prayers.
rcallimachi	712333978997547009	2016-03-22T17:43:49	PatriotsHarbor Please don't insult dogs!
rcallimachi	712333662872866816	2016-03-22T17:42:34	40. So basically, ISIS' gives equal value to a Kalashnikov, a suicide belt and a Twitter hashtag
rcallimachi	712333201209958401	2016-03-22T17:40:44	39. In wake of Paris attack, ISIS put out an essay explaining how they had turned propaganda particularly on Twitter as an instrument of war
rcallimachi	712332761655279616	2016-03-22T17:38:59	38. ISIS' channel is now asking supporters to flood Twitter using hashtags they created to cheer Brussels attack 
rcallimachi	712331993615306753	2016-03-22T17:35:56	37. Paris witnesses described detonation mechanism as being an object held in one's hand with cord that travelled to suicide belt.
rcallimachi	712331769694064640	2016-03-22T17:35:03	36. At one location a button believed to be part of detonation mechanism was found, as were 9V batteries, wires, and scotch tape
rcallimachi	712331543734304768	2016-03-22T17:34:09	35. In the 55-page police report on the Paris attacks witnesses saw Paris attackers holding something in their hand, assumed to be detonator
rcallimachi	712331263647076352	2016-03-22T17:33:02	34. Notice that men on left both are wearing a single glove. No one knows for sure but there is speculation this might be to cover detonator
rcallimachi	712330893826899969	2016-03-22T17:31:34	33. Also Belgian police have confirmed the 3 men below are suspects and are asking public's help to ID man with hat 
rcallimachi	712330458294525952	2016-03-22T17:29:50	32. Official release is in multiple languages &amp;appears on their blue-and-red logo. Was disseminated 1st on Telegram 
rcallimachi	712330039971418113	2016-03-22T17:28:10	31. Khilafa News. The official release switches back to their usual lingo. The attackers are "Soldiers of the Caliphate." Belgium= Crusader
rcallimachi	712329725843218432	2016-03-22T17:26:55	30. Notice that in the Amaq release they referred to "Islamic State fighters." Next is a release via ISIS' official channels, among them
rcallimachi	712329550584274944	2016-03-22T17:26:13	29. Amaq is their semi official news agency which acts like a kind of ISIS "Associated Press wire," getting out news in neutral language
rcallimachi	712329157234053120	2016-03-22T17:24:40	28. It's important to note that the chain of custody on the ISIS claim of responsibility follows their usual playbook: (1) Release on Amaq
rcallimachi	712320646357848064	2016-03-22T16:50:51	27. ISIS has now moved from semi official news agency Amaq to its Khilafa Channel &amp; is posting the claim in French

rcallimachi	712307952426852352	2016-03-22T16:00:24	26. ISIS is now advising its "brothers" in Belgium to only go online with encryption. (Thanks MichaelSSmithII) 
rcallimachi	712305976611835904	2016-03-22T15:52:33	Palsenberg I take it you have never seen PGP desktop
rcallimachi	712302165805703168	2016-03-22T15:37:24	25. Interestingly: ISIS is getting much faster at claiming its attacks in the West. Post-Paris we waited an entire day
rcallimachi	712301190688677888	2016-03-22T15:33:32	24. The Amaq claim was disseminated on its own Telegram channel and then picked up by the official Telegram channels of the terror group
rcallimachi	712300976443621376	2016-03-22T15:32:41	23. Recall Amaq is basically ISIS' wire service and months now they have been first to claim major attacks 
rcallimachi	712300629780262912	2016-03-22T15:31:18	22. And on cue, we now have a claim from ISIS: The Amaq News Agency has claimed that ISIS fighters detonated their vests at airport &amp;station
rcallimachi	712298787071467520	2016-03-22T15:23:59	21. And here is a pro-Qaeda channel claiming Brussels as part of a line of attacks by Qaeda in Africa: 
rcallimachi	712297852916133888	2016-03-22T15:20:16	20. How both ISIS &amp; Qaeda boosters are claiming attack. Below is screenshot of ISIS channel asking ppl to Tweet: 
rcallimachi	712297426489577472	2016-03-22T15:18:34	19. So overall my point now is we have many reasons to believe this is ISIS, but let's not rule out Al Qaeda. And on that note notice
rcallimachi	712297207668580352	2016-03-22T15:17:42	18. While that number may be exaggerated, we know there were at least 30: 10 directly involved as attackers on 11/13 and 20 more arrested
rcallimachi	712296875458732032	2016-03-22T15:16:23	16. Also remember that in the story I just reported, Abaaoud claimed that he had entered Europe via refugee stream with 90 other jihadists.
rcallimachi	712296519945297920	2016-03-22T15:14:58	15. Has been an ISIS hotbed since 2011/2012. More jihadists per capita have gone to Syria from Belgium than from any other European country
rcallimachi	712296308669849600	2016-03-22T15:14:08	14. A priori an airport is a much more Al Qaeda-like target. Still it's hard to imagine that AQ would have moved in on Brussels, which
rcallimachi	712295917827784704	2016-03-22T15:12:35	12. Unless of course ISIS figured out what many travelers have remarked: Anyone can get into the check in concourse. Checks begin at Xray
rcallimachi	712295301407711232	2016-03-22T15:10:08	11. The train station hit this morning is in keeping with this philosophy. But the airport? It goes against that advice
rcallimachi	712295007412228096	2016-03-22T15:08:58	10. He urges them to hit soft targets - the softer the better. And immediately after we see Abaaoud's cell is trying to hit trains/concerts
rcallimachi	712294742739066881	2016-03-22T15:07:55	9. In that interview Hakim clearly states that ISIS fighters should abandon the symbolism that was typically associated with Qaeda attacks
rcallimachi	712294582969638912	2016-03-22T15:07:17	8. For those who don't know, Hakim is considered the "godfather" of the French jihadi scene. He has been a mentor to generations of youths
rcallimachi	712294421270831105	2016-03-22T15:06:38	7. But here's where I want us to be careful: In March 2015, ISIS released interview in its French language magazine with Boubaker Al-Hakim
rcallimachi	712294074355728384	2016-03-22T15:05:15	6. That's not unusual: Took more than a day to get ISIS' claim post Nov 13; and several days for AQAP to claim Charlie Hebdo
rcallimachi	712293674575601664	2016-03-22T15:03:40	5. As of 11:03 am EST, no claim of responsibility on either Al Qaeda or ISIS' official channels, though boosters of both are cheering
rcallimachi	712293409894043652	2016-03-22T15:02:37	4. As far as civilian targets, I can't think of anything that is better guarded than an airport and yet that's where these bombs went off
rcallimachi	712293270399881216	2016-03-22T15:02:04	3. Death toll is still preliminary but I fear damage is significant. If nothing else extremists succeeded in penetrating best guarded venue
rcallimachi	712292535482359810	2016-03-22T14:59:08	2. The news out of Brussels is grim: At least two back-to-back explosions at the well-guarded airport, and at least one at a train station
rcallimachi	712292279101345792	2016-03-22T14:58:07	1. I will be Tweeting some thoughts on the Brussels attack here for those of you that want to join me.

rcallimachi	711604795052838914	2016-03-20T17:26:18	18. Other witnesses say he returned to Belgium 11/14. Makes sense: CCTV footage captured him getting croissant at station en route 2Belgium
rcallimachi	711604321469767680	2016-03-20T17:24:25	17. A part of the police report I could not parse is a witness who claims that Salah Abdeslam was with Abaaoud in Saint Denis thru 11/17
rcallimachi	711604033149149184	2016-03-20T17:23:17	16. During negotiation, ISIS told police to remove troops from Syria. If they didn't agree in 5 minutes they would throw hostage out window
rcallimachi	711603588481605632	2016-03-20T17:21:31	15. At the Bataclan, one of the gunmen at one point stopped and started playing the xylophone and laughing sadistically
rcallimachi	711603282515464195	2016-03-20T17:20:18	14. In one bar, suicide bomber walked in, smiled at diners, excused himself for the disturbance and then blew himself up
rcallimachi	711598617241509892	2016-03-20T17:01:45	13. To date no evidence that attackers were drugged. Witnesses uniformly described them as "calm" and "determined."
rcallimachi	711598287367880705	2016-03-20T17:00:27	12. At 7 different sites bombers set off belts. Ingredients left behind inc 9V battery &amp; TATP residue, suggest common bomb making protocol
rcallimachi	711597683107106817	2016-03-20T16:58:03	11. Witness saw them flip out a laptop. On screen came line of gibberish that looked like code. Not conclusive but suggestive of encryption
rcallimachi	711596759659765760	2016-03-20T16:54:22	10. They had learned lesson that communication by cell can be intercepted. So they were forcing their captives to act as their phone booth
rcallimachi	711595884081864704	2016-03-20T16:50:54	9. Inside the Bataclan they stole phones from their hostages and used them to call police to negotiate. Again they were disciplined
rcallimachi	711595496146653184	2016-03-20T16:49:21	8. But a 3rd entered via emergency exit after waiting for escapees to open it. They knew the layout and knew where to go to trap people
rcallimachi	711594854980182017	2016-03-20T16:46:48	7. One of the phones recovered in a trash can outside Bataclan included plans of concert hall. Two attackers entered through main entrance
rcallimachi	711590963509121025	2016-03-20T16:31:21	6. When Abaaoud was finally killed in a building in Saint Denis, police found dozens of unused cellphones still in wrapper. Burner phones
rcallimachi	711589625744248832	2016-03-20T16:26:02	5. The 10 members of the ISIS team showed remarkable op sec discipline: Not a single email, chat or message found so far between attackers
rcallimachi	711589015779151875	2016-03-20T16:23:36	4. It was the distinctive color of Abaaoud's shoes that allowed police to determine he was driver of SEAT car which opened fire on bars
rcallimachi	711588159558127616	2016-03-20T16:20:12	3. The orange sneakers were reported by a witness near one of the targeted bars, was captured on CCTV footage in Paris &amp; Saint Denis
rcallimachi	711587449965772800	2016-03-20T16:17:23	2. Much has been reported about Nov 13 killings, here are some of the details I didn't know, starting with fact Abaaoud wore orange sneakers
rcallimachi	711586470000205825	2016-03-20T16:13:29	1. I will be tweeting some of the findings revealed in our latest story on the Paris attacks. Join me here: 
rcallimachi	711584930434826240	2016-03-20T16:07:22	sashaxweiss We reached out to the witnesses mentioned in the report, and only published those who agreed.
rcallimachi	711584439529250817	2016-03-20T16:05:25	leahmcelrath Sweet of you Leah. Thanks
rcallimachi	711572588619808769	2016-03-20T15:18:20	I can't decide if it's a good thing or a bad thing that I just got this follow. Probably not good. 
rcallimachi	711583864142041088	2016-03-20T16:03:08	cc_edgordon Thank you Ed
rcallimachi	711581846753173504	2016-03-20T15:55:07	emptywheel josephfcox Yes. Street outside concert hall. No telegram mentioned. Only Gmail (with empty folders) and images of layout
rcallimachi	711581330811838466	2016-03-20T15:53:04	emptywheel josephfcox Exactly. Thanks for outpointing.
rcallimachi	711579647096414208	2016-03-20T15:46:23	emptywheel josephfcox Argh, I see your point now. Let me see if I can get it changed
rcallimachi	711578228541018112	2016-03-20T15:40:44	emptywheel josephfcox Crates of unused phones is at Abaaoud's apt in Saint Denis. Since not used not relevant to issue of encryption
rcallimachi	711577146930688000	2016-03-20T15:36:26	emptywheel josephfcox Please read the story. Burner phone recovered was in a trash can outside the Bataclan
rcallimachi	711577013677592577	2016-03-20T15:35:55	emptywheel josephfcox Nope.
rcallimachi	711576367062712320	2016-03-20T15:33:21	emptywheel josephfcox For example, report includes detailed notes on what was found on each recovered burner phone, down to Gmail address
rcallimachi	711575724491194370	2016-03-20T15:30:47	emptywheel josephfcox Computer not mentioned. And since 2 of 3 suicide bombers went off in Bataclan, I'm guessing it was ruined
rcallimachi	711575579519279105	2016-03-20T15:30:13	emptywheel josephfcox Not true. The report I have describes all items of value recovered inside Bataclan and elsewhere
rcallimachi	711573904104550400	2016-03-20T15:23:33	josephfcox 6. Not to mention all the ISIS private Telegram channels which are giving tips on best forms of encryption, lessons learned etc
rcallimachi	711573696721371136	2016-03-20T15:22:44	josephfcox 5. Witness is not an expert but her description is certainly suggestive of a PGP or similar encryption software
rcallimachi	711573547236335617	2016-03-20T15:22:08	josephfcox 4. See testimony from women inside the Bataclan who saw gunman flip open laptop and saw lines of code crawling across the screen
rcallimachi	711573223624851456	2016-03-20T15:20:51	josephfcox 3. ISIS themselves in video post Paris attack bragged they had used a PGP key as the mode of end-to-end encryption
rcallimachi	711573087783940097	2016-03-20T15:20:19	josephfcox 2. Every other ISIS foiled plot involved attempts at various technologies, showing they were trying but hadn't figured it out.
rcallimachi	711572897870061569	2016-03-20T15:19:33	josephfcox Yes lots: 1. ISIS fighter arrested pre-attack in Paris August 2015 told interrogators Abaaoud had trained him to use encryption;
rcallimachi	711567999594065920	2016-03-20T15:00:06	We take you inside the Bataclan with new details of the Paris attack, including the police negotiation with ISIS 
rcallimachi	711304195089911809	2016-03-19T21:31:50	Spookily, it looks like ISIS may be monitoring tour groups. January's Istanbul bomb targeted a group of Germans. This one, Israelis.
rcallimachi	711295150610223104	2016-03-19T20:55:53	Seems the bomb in Istanbul's Istiklal was ISIS, not PKK. Americans, Israelis among the dead. Bad times for Turkey 
rcallimachi	711192719083839488	2016-03-19T14:08:52	shababaty All of them were on terror watch lists with the exception of the two using Syrian passports, who remain unidentified
rcallimachi	710885245155983361	2016-03-18T17:47:04	NivEdry Fluent french yes
rcallimachi	710883865343225856	2016-03-18T17:41:35	NivEdry Really? Can you please send me? I did not recognize him in the Dabiq article
rcallimachi	710883076142972928	2016-03-18T17:38:27	My colleagues Milan Schreuer, aurelienbrd and Alissanyt have confirmed Abdeslam's arrest: 
rcallimachi	710881975519879168	2016-03-18T17:34:05	15. Saleh Abdeslam's arrest may be one of the biggest test's of Europe's interrogation policy. We know torture doesn't work. So what does?
rcallimachi	710880664363671552	2016-03-18T17:28:52	14 &amp; I have seen police reports speculating even his brother may have slipped into Syria, which would make Salah least experienced of the 10
rcallimachi	710880367901806592	2016-03-18T17:27:41	13 Abdeslam was the least battle-hardened of the ISIS commandos. Along with his brother, Brahim, he is only one who never went to Syria
rcallimachi	710877902540247042	2016-03-18T17:17:54	12. Tweet from Belgian Minister of State for Migration confirming Salah Abdeslam's arrest: 
rcallimachi	710877624730521602	2016-03-18T17:16:47	11 Belgian Secretary of State for Migration Théo Francken on Twitter "We hebben hem," meaning "We've got him" 
rcallimachi	710877194755641346	2016-03-18T17:15:05	10. So far French President Francois Hollande only confirms raid in Belgium has "link to Paris attacks"  
rcallimachi	710875311429148672	2016-03-18T17:07:36	Hear about IS rape on "industrial scale" in voice of Rukmini rcallimachi &amp; cry. Just as well, tape has child lock 
rcallimachi	710875241690611712	2016-03-18T17:07:19	9. Besides the 10 attackers, plus Abaaoud's cousin &amp; handful of accomplices in Belgium, how many others helped ? How large was the network?
rcallimachi	710874889708806144	2016-03-18T17:05:55	8. We know they used encryption (2) but not what kind. Was it really a PGP key as ISIS claimed? (3) How many bombmakers did they have?
rcallimachi	710874545176121345	2016-03-18T17:04:33	7. Among many questions I still have about Paris attacks: 1 How did  attackers get to Europe. Two came on refugee boat; what about rest?
rcallimachi	710873764322549760	2016-03-18T17:01:27	6. Regardless, if he is taken alive &amp; if he talks, the intelligence he could share could  blow open how ISIS carried out the Paris attacks
rcallimachi	710873460118069248	2016-03-18T17:00:14	5. It's unclear why Abdeslam did not die in Paris with one report indicating he lost his cool/decided to bail, calling friend to get him
rcallimachi	710873099667939328	2016-03-18T16:58:49	4. It was also Abdeslam who booked the hotel rooms the fighters used. Finally it was he who dropped off the Stade de France suicide bombers
rcallimachi	710872802384089089	2016-03-18T16:57:38	3. A reminder that Abdeslam was described as the logistical chief of the Nov 13 attacks. It was he who rented the cars used in the shootings
rcallimachi	710872619915091968	2016-03-18T16:56:54	2. If he is taken alive, it's major development. Abdeslam is the only surviving member of 10-person ISIS team that carried out Paris attacks
rcallimachi	710871988932382720	2016-03-18T16:54:24	1. Various media reporting  Salah Abdeslam has been a) captured or b) surrounded or c) shot in a raid in Belgium. Details still unconfirmed

rcallimachi	700788489697120256	2016-02-19T21:06:10	15/ Why? Because, as they explain, Twitter has the fewest regulations and is the most lax in regards to cracking down on offensive content

rcallimachi	700785709880217600	2016-02-19T20:55:07	12/ After watching the rise of ISIS on Twitter for more than 2 years, shouldn't the Twitter formulaire have a specific option for terror?
rcallimachi	700785378165465091	2016-02-19T20:53:48	11/ Most ISIS accounts are not harassing any 1 person in particular. They're diffusing a violent ideology, without a specific target
rcallimachi	700785138880262144	2016-02-19T20:52:51	10/ But the next page prompts you to choose if it is you or someone else that is being harassed. Which doesn't work for most terror accounts
rcallimachi	700784707613536256	2016-02-19T20:51:08	9/ Here are the options you can choose when you report an account (I chose engaging in harassment or violence) 
rcallimachi	700783392841867264	2016-02-19T20:45:55	8/ Among the problems is that if you want to report a terror-related account, the Twitter formulaire does not have an relevant option

rcallimachi	700782507751505920	2016-02-19T20:42:24	6/ Despite the fact that Twitter could not find a violation, the manager of that account who is from Missouri, is now facing terror charges
rcallimachi	700782214649421824	2016-02-19T20:41:14	5/ That account was calling for journalists (myself included) to be killed by IS sympathizers in the US for the crime of reporting the news
rcallimachi	700781705997713411	2016-02-19T20:39:13	4/ I received a response from twitter, stating that they could not "find a violation of our guidelines" in the account, despite the fact
rcallimachi	700781478544875520	2016-02-19T20:38:19	3/ That said, there's a long way to go. When I reported the "Muslimah" acct to Twitter for the threats she had issued against journalists

rcallimachi	695722321605234688	2016-02-05T21:35:02	AmorShabbi Swiss woman was never held by Belmoktar's group. Negotiators believed she was held by Ansar Dine. Now AQIM says they had her

rcallimachi	695716264145252353	2016-02-05T21:10:57	16. Guessing Belmokhtar's speechwriter missed the stories about the remarkable Franco-Mauritanian female photographer killed in the Splendid

rcallimachi	695714601393061888	2016-02-05T21:04:21	12. Canadian hostage Robert Fowler recounted Belmokhtar's reaction when he saw how ill the German woman was. He became visibly angry
rcallimachi	695714383859736576	2016-02-05T21:03:29	11. her for ransom. It was also Abou Zeid who kidnapped a German and an Austrian woman, treating them terribly and allowing 1 to get sick
rcallimachi	695714106947534849	2016-02-05T21:02:23	10. Abou Zeid, who led the most famous other brigade, kidnapped Italian Mariasandra Mariani &amp; held her for nearly a year before releasing
rcallimachi	695713901934219264	2016-02-05T21:01:34	9. That for more than a decade, Belmokhtar operated in the same desert as other AQIM battalions, which had no issues taking &amp; holding women
rcallimachi	695713652716994562	2016-02-05T21:00:35	8. Plenty of women were killed at the Radisson Blu last year in Bamako and at the Splendid last month in Burkina. However it bears noting
rcallimachi	695713478968012800	2016-02-05T20:59:53	7. At Ain Amenas, Belmokhtar's men proudly announced that they had spared the women. Of course this is all from their perspective
rcallimachi	695713183525425152	2016-02-05T20:58:43	6. in Mauritania, the woman was the only one released relatively quickly and without ransom, according to what the negotiator then told me
rcallimachi	695713013882580992	2016-02-05T20:58:02	5. But Belmokhtar is just about only Al-Qaeda leader that followed those guidelines. Circa 2008/2009, when his group kidnapped 3 Spaniards
rcallimachi	695712758311100417	2016-02-05T20:57:01	4. Guidelines articulated years ago and based on how female noncombatants are treated in Islamic law indeed makes it illegal to take them
rcallimachi	695712592954789893	2016-02-05T20:56:22	3. To me this is further evidence that Belmokhtar is alive. His group's statement says that Al Qaeda does not permit the taking of females

rcallimachi	695364592558444544	2016-02-04T21:53:32	JaredWyand And before you comment on our coverage, you would do well to actually read it: 
rcallimachi	695364404590718976	2016-02-04T21:52:47	JaredWyand Yazidis are the only slaves who have been systematically taken as a policy of ISIS. Suggest you do a modicum of research
rcallimachi	695359376823967744	2016-02-04T21:32:49	JaredWyand ChestnutPrince We can confidently count them because the Yazidi community has maintained a database of their missing relatives
rcallimachi	695290404405530624	2016-02-04T16:58:44	JaredWyand ChestnutPrince Not that it matters but your numbers are off: IS has 3000+ enslaved Yazidis, mostly women &amp; some children/men

rcallimachi	691500141107355648	2016-01-25T05:57:35	An ISIS video appears to show the Paris attackers earlier in Syria and Iraq 
rcallimachi	691457799763664898	2016-01-25T03:09:20	30/Finally before I hit the sack in what is now 4am in Paris I'd be amiss if I didn't thank charliewinter for helping me think this through
rcallimachi	691456140056641536	2016-01-25T03:02:45	29/ As one example see these screengrabs: 1. Abaaoud against flag vs 2. Samy Amimour addressing camera in Syria/Iraq 
rcallimachi	691451972050931718	2016-01-25T02:46:11	28/ Q for me: Was he supposed to be there? Or did he improves &amp; insist on micromanaging attack to avoid past failures like Thalys/Verviers?
rcallimachi	691451350169812992	2016-01-25T02:43:43	27/ The cellphone signals emitted by his phone showed that he drove past the cafes and the Bataclan, as if to survey/assess the carnage
rcallimachi	691451059185831936	2016-01-25T02:42:33	26/ When I was in Paris last Nov, one of the "Aha" moments was when the prosecutor announced Abaaoud's phone records placed him at the scene
rcallimachi	691450291246518272	2016-01-25T02:39:30	25 Again this is speculation, but I think anyone who sees video will be struck by the contrast in quality between Abaaoud's footage &amp; rest
rcallimachi	691449518190100480	2016-01-25T02:36:26	24/ For if he was chosen as one of the original attackers, why was he not included in the well-scripted, well-costumed montage on the dunes?
rcallimachi	691449258344607745	2016-01-25T02:35:24	23/ And if it's being shot in Europe - a low-budget, low quality video - that to me suggests Abaaoud was not mean to take part in the attack
rcallimachi	691448600174432257	2016-01-25T02:32:47	22/ And now this is speculation, but it makes me wonder if he is filming this in  Europe, during the attack itself.
rcallimachi	691448313124634625	2016-01-25T02:31:38	21/ The difference between how Abaaoud appears vs others suggests Abaaoud is not in Syria. He's not in a place where he can be filmed freely
rcallimachi	691447618162008065	2016-01-25T02:28:53	20/ The lighting is poor, the only decor is a haphazardly hung ISIS flag, he's not properly miked and he is not wearing the same "uniform"
rcallimachi	691447331208761344	2016-01-25T02:27:44	19/ This extended segment is in contrast to the footage showing the operational leader of the attack, Abaaoud, who is filmed inside a room
rcallimachi	691447132679716865	2016-01-25T02:26:57	18/ He rails against the West &amp; then is filmed holding up the bleeding head of a man he's just executed in a scene of choreographed murder
rcallimachi	691446757587316737	2016-01-25T02:25:28	17 You also see French citizen Samy Amimour, so loved by his family that his 67yoa father travelled all the way to Syria to try to save him
rcallimachi	691446435926151169	2016-01-25T02:24:11	16/ standing behind a prisoner in an orange uniform. He shoves him to the ground, places his knee on the victim's back and then beheads him
rcallimachi	691446257034891264	2016-01-25T02:23:28	15/ It's in this segment that you see 20-year-old Bilal Hadfi, youngest of the attackers who wept when he said goodbye to his mom last year
rcallimachi	691446048141619200	2016-01-25T02:22:38	14/ Identical camouflage uniforms. They are wearing microphones, their movements look rehearsed and quality of footage is high-end
rcallimachi	691445710181498880	2016-01-25T02:21:18	13/ The core of the video is filmed against a landscape of windswept dunes. Seven of the attackers are shown executing victims. They wear
rcallimachi	691445269028806656	2016-01-25T02:19:33	12/ Also of interest is the difference in cinematic quality between portion when leader Abdelhamid Abaaoud is speaking vs other attackers.
rcallimachi	691361643528237057	2016-01-24T20:47:15	11/ Here ISIS is making crystal-clear: This is not just "ISIS-inspired." This *is* the Islamic State attacking on European soil
rcallimachi	691361369027772416	2016-01-24T20:46:09	10/ Recall that after Charlie Hebdo, even though Kouachi brother had trained in Yemen, analysts questioned degree of AQAP involvement
rcallimachi	691361075854315520	2016-01-24T20:45:00	9/ Another one of the attackers is seen beheading a captive. As charliewinter argues, it belies deep ties to the core, organization etc
rcallimachi	691360769795948544	2016-01-24T20:43:47	9. Bilal Hafdi, the youngest of the attackers who wept when he said goodbye to his mother earlier this year, is seen executing a prisoner
rcallimachi	691360480187645953	2016-01-24T20:42:37	8. Video is now out and what is of note is that it shows the 9 Paris attackers in Syria/Iraq, wearing camouflage and carrying out atrocities

rcallimachi	688197411294986243	2016-01-16T03:13:43	Our latest story on al-Qaeda's siege of a hotel on the main drag in Burkina Faso's capital 
rcallimachi	688192597240627200	2016-01-16T02:54:35	3. It's now the middle of the night in Burkina Faso and the operation is ongoing. "Intermittent gunfire," she said.
rcallimachi	688192427929149440	2016-01-16T02:53:55	2. The assault is led by Burkinabe soldiers with help of French soldiers. Witness contacted by phone saw them gathering on 1 side of hotel
rcallimachi	688192192305704960	2016-01-16T02:52:59	1. Latest from an eyewitness 50 yards from the hotel: The assault on the Splendide compound has begun. "Several hostages released." Gunfire.
rcallimachi	688187254397779968	2016-01-16T02:33:22	_khalidshami charliewinter Rita_Katz Yes indeed. I should have included that.
rcallimachi	688177656215388161	2016-01-16T01:55:13	MustDeportTrump More than half are from Burkina. Rest are French, according to a French eyewitness interviewed by phone who is near hotel
rcallimachi	688177445590007809	2016-01-16T01:54:23	5. The jihadists inside the hotel claim they killed 30 ppl and that the operation was "revenge against France and the disbelieving West."
rcallimachi	688176959021424640	2016-01-16T01:52:27	4. Meanwhile AQIM has put out new statement. According to transcript provided by SITE, AQIm claims that they reached jihadists inside hotel
rcallimachi	688176741781651456	2016-01-16T01:51:35	3. Same witness saw at least 2 bodies carried out of hotel as well as a woman who appeared to be in shock, and who was held up by soldiers
rcallimachi	688176513334689792	2016-01-16T01:50:41	2. At least 30 are French soldiers, says witness reached by phone. They are studying plans &amp; more are arriving suggesting reading for attack
rcallimachi	688176266856378372	2016-01-16T01:49:42	1. Latest from eyewitness 50m from the hotel: Appears as if security forces are prepping for assault. Some 70 soldiers are amassed outside
rcallimachi	688163885275164672	2016-01-16T01:00:30	ALBANRODRIGUE It's too early to tell.
rcallimachi	688162694273216512	2016-01-16T00:55:46	multesimus Thank you
rcallimachi	688162505475031042	2016-01-16T00:55:01	5. At the Radisson, the attackers used automatic weapons and grenades. If early reports prove accurate, at Splendide there were car bombs
rcallimachi	688162294014980097	2016-01-16T00:54:10	4. If you study the Radisson attack in Mali vs the Splendide attack today, there are signs of growing sophistication, especially in weaponry
rcallimachi	688161941307559936	2016-01-16T00:52:46	3. But this is the first major attack in the country &amp; the only in Ouagadougou, the capital. And it's AQIM's 2nd major attack since November
rcallimachi	688161648104742914	2016-01-16T00:51:36	2. According to tweetsintheME. there have been a handful of attacks at the border and just inside the border, including in Aug, Sept &amp; Oct
rcallimachi	688161329224417280	2016-01-16T00:50:20	1. Some smart analysis from  tweetsintheME: (a) This is first major attack in Burkina (b) From Radisson to Splendide, arc of sophistication
rcallimachi	688160968916905984	2016-01-16T00:48:55	ocomar His apartment is above Veranda, not Cappuccino .
rcallimachi	688153527403692034	2016-01-16T00:19:20	5. At the Splendide entrance, he thinks they set off a bomb &amp; showed me footage he filmed on phone showing bottom of the hotel in a blaze
rcallimachi	688153281609076737	2016-01-16T00:18:22	4. When it died down, he peeked &amp; saw they had run across the street to the Splendide Hotel, as well as to the Cappuccino Cafe, opening fire
rcallimachi	688153009394585600	2016-01-16T00:17:17	3. From where he was lying down, he was right above the jihadists and heard them screaming: "Get out! Out!" And heard more shooting.
rcallimachi	688152806021181441	2016-01-16T00:16:28	2. Suddenly he heard shooting, ran to the balcony &amp; saw the assailants enter the restaurant. He hit the deck, laying on his belly on balcony
rcallimachi	688152582099865600	2016-01-16T00:15:35	1. Just spoke to eyewitness to Burkina attack: He says he was upstairs in his apartment, located above Le Veranda restaurant in Ouagadougou

rcallimachi	688132121177669633	2016-01-15T22:54:17	SITE is saying al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb has claimed responsibility for the attack in Burkina's capital. This is AQIM's first in Burkina

rcallimachi	687850612164300800	2016-01-15T04:15:40	Rubio claims ISIS is trying to get their fighters into the U.S. as immigrant doctors and engineers. Claims it's a "fact." Huh?

rcallimachi	687820667505479681	2016-01-15T02:16:40	liamstack 4. But that report spanned period after declaration of the Caliphate so unclear how recruitment is going now following airstrikes
rcallimachi	687820462240477189	2016-01-15T02:15:51	liamstack 3. Yet another yardstick is the strength of their recruiting. Latest TheSoufanGroup report indicated boom in foreign fighters
rcallimachi	687820068118507520	2016-01-15T02:14:17	liamstack 2. But another yardstick is how much territory they control and by that measure, the ISIS of 2016 is weaker than the ISIS of 2015
rcallimachi	687819888719753218	2016-01-15T02:13:35	liamstack 1. One way to measure  is potency of attacks &amp; by that yardstick, they are getting stronger. Consider Paris attacks/Russian plane

rcallimachi	687619305404502016	2016-01-14T12:56:32	michaelh992 charliewinter To my knowledge they have not recognized it as an official outlet.
rcallimachi	687618033188212736	2016-01-14T12:51:29	charliewinter michaelh992 If we call everything "official ISIS" just bc we know it's run by IS, it dilutes real officialness of Dabiq etc
rcallimachi	687617760990511104	2016-01-14T12:50:24	charliewinter michaelh992 I agree with SITE, which is trying to fleck at the gray by calling it ISIS-linked.
rcallimachi	687617468110618624	2016-01-14T12:49:14	charliewinter michaelh992 Charlie I agree with you but can we really call something official when organization has not made it official?
rcallimachi	687615314473922560	2016-01-14T12:40:40	michaelh992 Exactly. Wonder how much longer we will say "ISIS-linked" versus "official ISIS media outlet"
rcallimachi	687614476988903425	2016-01-14T12:37:21	MeganDrapalski Only speculation at this point. Perhaps mirroring how news is released in rest of the world, ie via a news outlet before gov
rcallimachi	687611304463446016	2016-01-14T12:24:44	7. And sometime after, ISIS followed up with own statement. Analysts believe that Amaq is run by ISIS members and acts as their mouthpiece
rcallimachi	687611013550718976	2016-01-14T12:23:35	6. Immediately after the San Bernadino attack, it was al-Amaq that first announced the couple was acting in the name of the Islamic State
rcallimachi	687610773431009280	2016-01-14T12:22:38	5. In next few hours, I expect ISIS will put out an official claim of responsibility. But in recent months, Amaq has been first, For example
rcallimachi	687610535530082305	2016-01-14T12:21:41	4. ... &amp; security forces tasked with protecting them in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta." See screengrab. 
rcallimachi	687610062941110272	2016-01-14T12:19:48	3. The claim says: "A source for Amaq Agency: Fighters for Islamic State carried out this morning an armed attack targeted foreign nationals
rcallimachi	687609320356319232	2016-01-14T12:16:51	2. al-Amaq, a "news agency" closely tied to the Islamic State (some call it ISIS' unofficial wire service). Amaq put out claim via Twitter
rcallimachi	687608856164302849	2016-01-14T12:15:01	1. Today in Jakarta we saw once again the manner in which ISIS claims attacks. For the last few months, first word of attacks have come via

rcallimachi	685565770089140224	2016-01-08T20:56:31	8/ Her good luck is that she was held by Ansar Dine, who were less ideological than AQIM. Compare her captivity to Serge Lazarevic's
