TomJunod	691297663732551682	2016-01-24T16:33:01	bananapeele But that made me enjoy the movie *more.* it made something really dour absurd fun.

TomJunod	691294843566338048	2016-01-24T16:21:49	bananapeele I saw the movie yesterday and thought "that was amazing!" Much more than "dude really wants statuette."
TomJunod	691294323489398784	2016-01-24T16:19:45	bananapeele But that wasn't your takeaway from the movie after you saw the movie. That's your retrospective takeaway.

TomJunod	691287151829475328	2016-01-24T15:51:15	bananapeele Never felt the ambiance in Revenant was ostentatious, though.

TomJunod	691283390885142529	2016-01-24T15:36:18	bananapeele But the physical aspects were enough to make the movie An Experience.
TomJunod	691283176690446336	2016-01-24T15:35:27	bananapeele I bought in to the physical aspects of the movie in their entirety, the spiritual and emotional aspects not so much.
TomJunod	691280787853983744	2016-01-24T15:25:57	bananapeele I mean, he might only be trying to win an Oscar. But he's trying *really* hard.
TomJunod	691279522994348032	2016-01-24T15:20:56	bananapeele Okay, Leo, you win!
TomJunod	691279436532985857	2016-01-24T15:20:35	bananapeele You always see the effort with Leo. Of course, Revenant is *about* effort, so after a while you just throw up your hands....
TomJunod	691278999763353601	2016-01-24T15:18:51	bananapeele That's why it's never really moving, despite its being magnificent.
