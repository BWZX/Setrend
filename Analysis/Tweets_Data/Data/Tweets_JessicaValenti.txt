JessicaValenti	689213188240445440	2016-01-18T22:30:03	Whole Foods Brooklyn (wfmbrooklyn) has no heat &amp; is FRIGID. One of the cashiers there said they're expected to "smile and be happy" despite

JessicaValenti	689154185577787392	2016-01-18T18:35:36	adamconner i judged them even harder because i was a parent! it wasn't an emergency - she could have taken him to the BR.

JessicaValenti	688055991028551682	2016-01-15T17:51:46	DatLadyAli what's your point? i already explained i didn't write the headline and had it changed when i saw it.
JessicaValenti	688048366928965636	2016-01-15T17:21:28	KyleKulinski so you'll take it down? thx v much. incredibly frustrating to take heat for an argument you didn't make!
JessicaValenti	688047499945357312	2016-01-15T17:18:01	KyleKulinski so plse link to the piece if you take issue with it - but the headline is super misleading. thx
JessicaValenti	688047405946810368	2016-01-15T17:17:39	KyleKulinski fyi that headline was changed (i didn't write it!) because it's not what the piece argues.

JessicaValenti	686663474953502721	2016-01-11T21:38:24	Was aiming to make a point about the way we talk about celebs, but clearly didn't do a very good job. Apologies.
JessicaValenti	686663365515673601	2016-01-11T21:37:58	Since the break-up of my tweets don't make this clear: I am not trying to defend rudeness or bad behavior.
JessicaValenti	686662180071149568	2016-01-11T21:33:15	Fair point, and one I should have considered 
JessicaValenti	686661982922141696	2016-01-11T21:32:28	shereeny sure. i understood that she was responding to his taking a pic/filming, not reading off his phone but I get this
JessicaValenti	686661193176596480	2016-01-11T21:29:20	xbiscaynebaex i don't either! i was more making a point about how we have diff standards for people in public eye.
JessicaValenti	686660961051250688	2016-01-11T21:28:25	SanaSaeed i hear that. not trying to dismiss, just make a broader point about the way we talk about celebs.
JessicaValenti	686660641118093313	2016-01-11T21:27:09	xbiscaynebaex yeah not saying he wasn't allowed, i just mean it's a diff context than if someone was reading Qs off of phone.
JessicaValenti	686660243389067265	2016-01-11T21:25:34	abbeystone dstfelix i take that point. &amp; again, i'm not defending her behavior! just making a point about the broader culture of celeb
JessicaValenti	686659892606795778	2016-01-11T21:24:10	SanaSaeed of course. like i said, she was being a jerk &amp;not defending behavior. just find the extrapolation into "she's a bad person" odd
JessicaValenti	686659531061997569	2016-01-11T21:22:44	xbiscaynebaex like i wrote earlier, someone reported that it was because he was filming, not reading. if that was the case 100% agree
JessicaValenti	686658978009497602	2016-01-11T21:20:32	SanaSaeed that's not my understanding of what happened - another reporter in the room said it was because he was filming her

JessicaValenti	686649821780938753	2016-01-11T20:44:09	KaraRBrown and not saying this as someone attached to her in particular at all, just broadly curious about this in celeb culture
JessicaValenti	686649641060986880	2016-01-11T20:43:26	KaraRBrown i don't know. i for sure cringed when i saw it, but i don't get why it somehow proves she's inauthentic otherwise.
JessicaValenti	686648565351997440	2016-01-11T20:39:09	(Oh and to be clear, she was apparently responding to the report taking pics/filming, not reading Qs)
JessicaValenti	686647228216283138	2016-01-11T20:33:51	claireyfairy1 KaraRBrown KingFavre right. but again, not defending behavior at all. just think the response is disproportionate
JessicaValenti	686645502742495234	2016-01-11T20:26:59	KingFavre  another reporter said he was taking pics, not reading. but i hear that.
JessicaValenti	686644979507277824	2016-01-11T20:24:55	Kimberly124 THAT I totally agree with.
JessicaValenti	686644350999236608	2016-01-11T20:22:25	sophwilkinson exactly. it's like come on, we all know no one is THAT cool. nor are they THAT diva-ish
JessicaValenti	686644056378748930	2016-01-11T20:21:14	Like all of us, celebs are sometimes cool, sometimes jerks. Anyway, that's all. :)
JessicaValenti	686644003178168320	2016-01-11T20:21:02	People seem very invested in the idea that this woman couldn‚Äôt possible be authentically likeable, instead of the more likely truth...
JessicaValenti	686643863868567552	2016-01-11T20:20:29	Do folks really think if they were watched as carefully as some celebs that they‚Äôd never say or do anything sort of snitty or regrettable?
JessicaValenti	686643829009690626	2016-01-11T20:20:20	I find it strange that people will take one celebrity moment or interaction and extrapolate that into who they must be as a person.
