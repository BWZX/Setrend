MicroFundy	674978906093563905	2015-12-10T15:48:06	LAMR Bull case is if they get priced like traditional REITs - increase of a turn or two on AFFO = 25% + total return
MicroFundy	674978568288497664	2015-12-10T15:46:45	LAMR They have decent organic growth / pricing due to digital conversions + tuck in acquisition + 10% divy increase = 15% total return imo
MicroFundy	674978254743322624	2015-12-10T15:45:31	LAMR better than most REITs in raising rate environment. Length of contracts much shorter (less than year), so not as "fixed".
MicroFundy	674977763019890688	2015-12-10T15:43:33	LAMR makes next year div increase official...  $3.02 for '16 = 5.18% yield.
