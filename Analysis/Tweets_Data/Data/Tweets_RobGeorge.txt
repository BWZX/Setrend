RobGeorge	722856534724579328	2016-04-20T18:36:42	The Senate censured him for this BS with the deposits, and rightly so. So yeah, that's Andrew Jackson for you. Good riddance.
RobGeorge	722856253089665026	2016-04-20T18:35:35	So Jackson pushes Duane out for Roger Taney who removes the deposits (and who was neck-deep w/ crooked banks in Baltimore BTW).
RobGeorge	722856104661688320	2016-04-20T18:35:00	...but only if they were deemed unsafe. They were manifestly safe. Congress had concluded as much. Secretary Duane refused to remove them.
RobGeorge	722855844904210432	2016-04-20T18:33:58	He also broke the law during the bank war. Congress gave the Secretary of the Treasury the right to remove deposits from the BUS...
RobGeorge	722855659633414145	2016-04-20T18:33:13	But when GA was the tip of the spear advancing his project to clear out the old southwest, he said he couldn't do anything about it.
RobGeorge	722855543103029248	2016-04-20T18:32:46	This is the other side to the "Oh well Jackson was a nationalist" argument. When SC defied the (Jacksonian!) Tariff of Abominations, he was.
RobGeorge	722855414170132482	2016-04-20T18:32:15	He booted the Cherokees from GA, even though they had a treaty with the US. He basically told them he couldn't stop GA from violating.
