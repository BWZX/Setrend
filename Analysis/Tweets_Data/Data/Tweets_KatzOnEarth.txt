KatzOnEarth	719988409775865857	2016-04-12T20:39:48	chrisgeidner GrahamDavidA mattdpearce chasestrangio Hmm. I guess the key word is employment.

KatzOnEarth	719964529417957377	2016-04-12T19:04:54	I guess we'll never really know what his true motive was.    
KatzOnEarth	719974811729006593	2016-04-12T19:45:46	BltProofDiction BuzzFeedAndrew I can see the email. "HI- WHY DID YOU GIVE WA POST THIS INSTEAD OF DOING YRSLF ?????? THX."
KatzOnEarth	719974305388445697	2016-04-12T19:43:45	BltProofDiction BuzzFeedAndrew I wouldn't be shocked if this was the first time some AP higher-up even knew about the August AP story.
KatzOnEarth	719974095627137025	2016-04-12T19:42:55	BltProofDiction BuzzFeedAndrew I bet you it's internal. I'd routinely get shit from my bosses for NYT having a story I'd done months prior
KatzOnEarth	719973135722934272	2016-04-12T19:39:06	BltProofDiction BuzzFeedAndrew Pique, yeah. The Post's wording was misleading though. I read it that AP tried to do a story and failed.
KatzOnEarth	719972805798965248	2016-04-12T19:37:48	BltProofDiction BuzzFeedAndrew It's impossible to navigate as a peon, trust me.
KatzOnEarth	719972162065588225	2016-04-12T19:35:14	BltProofDiction BuzzFeedAndrew But those guys all just steal AP content (that they pay) like it's their job (which it is).
KatzOnEarth	719971670300192772	2016-04-12T19:33:17	BltProofDiction BuzzFeedAndrew (There are also non-newspaper "subscribers, like the networks, CNN, etc, who aren't on the board.)
KatzOnEarth	719971437696704512	2016-04-12T19:32:21	BltProofDiction BuzzFeedAndrew Its clients aren't clients. They're "members." They sit on the board. Hire/fire the CEO.
KatzOnEarth	719971320348454912	2016-04-12T19:31:53	BltProofDiction BuzzFeedAndrew It's actually even more complex than I said. AP competes against NYT, WaPo, etc. But NYT, WaPo, etc OWN it.
KatzOnEarth	719971025740505088	2016-04-12T19:30:43	BltProofDiction BuzzFeedAndrew For its core business, Reuters, sometimes AFP, sometimes Bloomberg.
KatzOnEarth	719970226796957698	2016-04-12T19:27:33	BltProofDiction BuzzFeedAndrew Simply put, AP's primary competitors are its own customers.
KatzOnEarth	719969772243447808	2016-04-12T19:25:44	North Carolina's governor retreats on LGBT rights. Sort of: 
KatzOnEarth	719967807925002242	2016-04-12T19:17:56	BuzzFeedAndrew BltProofDiction But most people just think the Post beat AP. So AP's pissed but can't do anything. Rinse, repeat.
KatzOnEarth	719967566672838656	2016-04-12T19:16:58	BuzzFeedAndrew BltProofDiction So, classic case. AP did the hard first part. The Post, which pays AP millions, picked up the ball and ran.
KatzOnEarth	719967312296701952	2016-04-12T19:15:58	BuzzFeedAndrew BltProofDiction People straight up plagiarize you and it's kosher. Your boss tells you to stop complaining and get to work.
KatzOnEarth	719967114438799361	2016-04-12T19:15:11	BuzzFeedAndrew BltProofDiction But you don't know what it means to have your work stolen until you've been a wire reporter.
KatzOnEarth	719966950915497984	2016-04-12T19:14:32	BuzzFeedAndrew BltProofDiction The not crediting enough outside the "family" thing I can't really speak to. I think I did, back when.
KatzOnEarth	719966635608641536	2016-04-12T19:13:16	BuzzFeedAndrew BltProofDiction So they beat a client, help the client, then watch as the client does it better with the ground primed.
KatzOnEarth	719966429525766145	2016-04-12T19:12:27	BuzzFeedAndrew BltProofDiction Then, AP has to compete against its own clients, who depend on it for much of the basis of their reporting.
KatzOnEarth	719966301750431744	2016-04-12T19:11:57	BuzzFeedAndrew BltProofDiction This one was written last August, right? Zero people gave a shit about fine-grain Trump details in August.
KatzOnEarth	719966085668331522	2016-04-12T19:11:05	BuzzFeedAndrew BltProofDiction Even when the stories are well-written and complete, they go right over everyone's head.
KatzOnEarth	719965978759663618	2016-04-12T19:10:40	BuzzFeedAndrew BltProofDiction Wow, that was a good example right there. I meant: In ways that don't fully communicate what they're about.
KatzOnEarth	719965865471569921	2016-04-12T19:10:13	BuzzFeedAndrew BltProofDiction So you get stories that break news before anyone's ready to read it, in ways that doesn't full communicate.
KatzOnEarth	719965592128778241	2016-04-12T19:09:08	BuzzFeedAndrew BltProofDiction Traditionally, AP gets stories much faster than everyone else and then can't write them for shit.
KatzOnEarth	719965264134205443	2016-04-12T19:07:49	BuzzFeedAndrew BltProofDiction A couple things here. First of all, this is a classic AP problem.

KatzOnEarth	719569494407049216	2016-04-11T16:55:11	HaitiVoteBlog bahare_kh According to the Times obit, he had made the accusations earlier that year: 
KatzOnEarth	719568734264913921	2016-04-11T16:52:09	HaitiVoteBlog bahare_kh I may be mistaken, but I thought the whistleblowing had already begun by that point.

KatzOnEarth	719462278547050497	2016-04-11T09:49:08	newsmite That's fair. But I stand by the wording, especially given the context that follows it.
KatzOnEarth	719461311428587520	2016-04-11T09:45:18	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina By the way, the source on the number of Cubans deployed was the Cuban govt.

KatzOnEarth	719461054573645824	2016-04-11T09:44:17	newsmite I'm working on a book about American empire now, actually.
KatzOnEarth	719460930891956224	2016-04-11T09:43:47	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina I guess I can just sit at home doing nothing like you then.
KatzOnEarth	719460672967454720	2016-04-11T09:42:46	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina You weren't there and you haven't read the book about it. What do you know about it?
KatzOnEarth	719460407535149056	2016-04-11T09:41:42	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Deny it? I reported it: 
KatzOnEarth	719460300571979776	2016-04-11T09:41:17	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina There were two sources listed there. The third would be our own eyes.
KatzOnEarth	719460110339280896	2016-04-11T09:40:31	newsmite No, I was acknowledging what you were saying, that Cuba and the US had different motivations.
KatzOnEarth	719459754544906240	2016-04-11T09:39:07	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Anyone who was there at the time though remembers how many planes were landing. It was constant.
KatzOnEarth	719459663868243968	2016-04-11T09:38:45	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina 140 a day was based on the flight logs, so Haitian airport and US military sources.
KatzOnEarth	719459222837161984	2016-04-11T09:37:00	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina I agreed that some planes couldn't land. I think the idea of an aid blockade is stupid. Misspent, yes. Blocked? No
KatzOnEarth	719459025964965888	2016-04-11T09:36:13	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Another 800 or so came in the days after the quake. (Some were Haitian doctors trained in Cuba.)
KatzOnEarth	719458857777541120	2016-04-11T09:35:33	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina There were 350 Cuban doctors in Haiti at the time of the quake, as the paragraph you cite says.
KatzOnEarth	719458780719759360	2016-04-11T09:35:14	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Well see that's the thing. The vast majority of planes were allowed to land. 140 a day.
KatzOnEarth	719458300803354625	2016-04-11T09:33:20	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Here's someone arguing all the aid in the country was under control of the United States: 
KatzOnEarth	719458073996304385	2016-04-11T09:32:26	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina And the rest of that paragraph doesn't do much for the rest of your argument, does it.
KatzOnEarth	719457945956847616	2016-04-11T09:31:55	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Sure there was. You might not agree with its intent or effects, but it was there.
KatzOnEarth	719457332212707329	2016-04-11T09:29:29	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Which you'd know if you read the rest of the paragraph you claim to be citing.
KatzOnEarth	719457266878046208	2016-04-11T09:29:13	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Except they were already there.
KatzOnEarth	719456908143435776	2016-04-11T09:27:48	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina The Cubans didn't deliver aid? That is ... going to be hard for the Cubans to take. They think they did.
KatzOnEarth	719456726538457088	2016-04-11T09:27:05	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Here's a whole paragraph for you. It's from the introduction, which you said you read. 
KatzOnEarth	719456617582997504	2016-04-11T09:26:39	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Is it now. Where's the rest of the paragraph?
KatzOnEarth	719456552474828800	2016-04-11T09:26:23	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina And tell me, if aid was under the control of the United States, how did the United States blockade it?
KatzOnEarth	719456361478754304	2016-04-11T09:25:38	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Cuba was under the control of the United States? That must be news to Cuba.
KatzOnEarth	719455686602723328	2016-04-11T09:22:57	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina You've cut off the paragraph you're citing. It's not there. You know that periods end sentences, right?
KatzOnEarth	719455201606967296	2016-04-11T09:21:01	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina And that paragraph is not about the United States. Try again.
KatzOnEarth	719455105741897728	2016-04-11T09:20:38	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina It hasn't though. So if you don't have a citation, I'm afraid this is another point on which you've lost.
KatzOnEarth	719454799054389248	2016-04-11T09:19:25	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Do I now. Cite?
KatzOnEarth	719454596956045313	2016-04-11T09:18:37	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Does it imply that? I think the whole "saving lives" frame is pretty bogus myself. But if you say so.
KatzOnEarth	719454371055038464	2016-04-11T09:17:43	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina And yet you've lost. Pity.
KatzOnEarth	719454296622952449	2016-04-11T09:17:25	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina But I suppose you know that, having carefully read Chapter 10.
KatzOnEarth	719454159624355840	2016-04-11T09:16:53	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina It absolutely dismantles it, top to bottom. It did the heavy lifting. You just leech off the echoes.
KatzOnEarth	719453978141003776	2016-04-11T09:16:09	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Ah, but the book blows that notion up in more detail than either of your lazy minds can imagine.
KatzOnEarth	719453834964312064	2016-04-11T09:15:35	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina For example: 
KatzOnEarth	719453657486462976	2016-04-11T09:14:53	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina She's obsessed with this supposed blockade of foreign aid. I don't think she quite gets how it works.
KatzOnEarth	719453505568813056	2016-04-11T09:14:17	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina You'd have to give some contextual examples of "civilising mission framing."
KatzOnEarth	719453235526909952	2016-04-11T09:13:12	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina She's offended and confused by the idea that the aid industry is destructive. What do you call that?
KatzOnEarth	719453052554604548	2016-04-11T09:12:29	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Ah, but you can't cite any of it. I thought you read it.
KatzOnEarth	719452685141995520	2016-04-11T09:11:01	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Yeah, but then you can't actually cite anything, other than a few lines she took out of context.
KatzOnEarth	719452572914991104	2016-04-11T09:10:34	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina And don't be so hard on yourself. I'm sure you aren't irrelevant to whatever it is you actually do.
KatzOnEarth	719452459375194112	2016-04-11T09:10:07	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina What are some examples of racism in there?
KatzOnEarth	719452246560387073	2016-04-11T09:09:17	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina The only thing that's been exposed is her closet neoliberalism.
KatzOnEarth	719452078956023808	2016-04-11T09:08:37	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Is it now. What's your evidence for that?
KatzOnEarth	719452006545534976	2016-04-11T09:08:19	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina You're so very bad at this.
KatzOnEarth	719451642228293632	2016-04-11T09:06:52	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Did I say you were irrelevant? You said you were irrelevant.
KatzOnEarth	719451434824179712	2016-04-11T09:06:03	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Why don't you drop the tough-guy act and tell me what's really brought you here tonight.
KatzOnEarth	719451092300521472	2016-04-11T09:04:41	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina You're so obsessed with facial hair. Is there a problem with yours?
KatzOnEarth	719450742805917697	2016-04-11T09:03:18	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina But I'm not crying. I'm just waiting in vain for you to make an original argument.
KatzOnEarth	719450663625891840	2016-04-11T09:02:59	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Red took two sentences and one paragraph out of context, and that's all you have. It's pathetic.
KatzOnEarth	719450363716362240	2016-04-11T09:01:48	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Oh sweetheart. That's not what's going on.
KatzOnEarth	719450097965252608	2016-04-11T09:00:44	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina The only thing this has exposed though is your inability to read, interpret and cite.
KatzOnEarth	719450016297984000	2016-04-11T09:00:25	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Arguing with you is indeed pissing into the wind. You got that right.
KatzOnEarth	719449784826871808	2016-04-11T08:59:30	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina No, I doubt anything would change your steely little mind. But alas, you have no idea what you're talking about.
KatzOnEarth	719449014534598656	2016-04-11T08:56:26	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Nope! That's the set-up from the beginning of the chapter. I thought you said you'd read it?
KatzOnEarth	719448050020794368	2016-04-11T08:52:36	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina What does the rest of that paragraph say, Phil? Or do you only quote out of context.
KatzOnEarth	719447551984996352	2016-04-11T08:50:37	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina And then what does the rest of that paragraph say?
KatzOnEarth	719447451929874433	2016-04-11T08:50:13	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Am I.
KatzOnEarth	719447194273726464	2016-04-11T08:49:12	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Yes. I guess you are. Or maybe you don't understand punctuation.
KatzOnEarth	719446847987838977	2016-04-11T08:47:49	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina You have a funny definition of silence. Sorry I crushed your argument on the merits and left you with ... this.
KatzOnEarth	719446618999820288	2016-04-11T08:46:55	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina If you really read the book and that's what you got out of it, that's your pathology, not mine.
KatzOnEarth	719446345485053952	2016-04-11T08:45:50	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina You and Red really are birds of a feather, I'll give you that.
KatzOnEarth	719445928252477440	2016-04-11T08:44:10	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina This tangent is a clear sign of a losing argument. Which is such a shock, I really thought you had this one.
KatzOnEarth	719445774564749312	2016-04-11T08:43:33	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina On whose behalf do you suppose I am propagandizing?
KatzOnEarth	719445695007207424	2016-04-11T08:43:15	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Oh, you did read it! So tell me more about the part about the US Occupation of Haiti.
KatzOnEarth	719445438642958336	2016-04-11T08:42:13	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina So disappointing. And here I thought we were going to have a substantive discussion about a book you haven't read.
KatzOnEarth	719445107079032832	2016-04-11T08:40:54	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Though I suppose your obsessing over this is a lot easier for you than arguing about a book you haven't read.
KatzOnEarth	719444912945696768	2016-04-11T08:40:08	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Ah, Phil. So glad you came out tonight to blather on about nothing.
KatzOnEarth	719444618824298496	2016-04-11T08:38:58	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Well there you have it, then.
KatzOnEarth	719444524829917184	2016-04-11T08:38:36	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Measured by the number of tweets on the topic by each of us, I'd say no. More of an obsession on your part.
KatzOnEarth	719444382001274881	2016-04-11T08:38:01	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Come now. I didn't make you defend calling me a misogynist white supremacist, did I?
KatzOnEarth	719444142363959296	2016-04-11T08:37:04	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Man, did I strike a nerve there or what. I'll leave it to you to figure out.
KatzOnEarth	719444018808156160	2016-04-11T08:36:35	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina You don't dictate to me either, comrade.
KatzOnEarth	719443492343267328	2016-04-11T08:34:29	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Let's go back to the part where I just blew up your description of my depiction of the 1915-34 US Occupation.
KatzOnEarth	719443267969003520	2016-04-11T08:33:36	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Which you'd know if you had read it, which you haven't.
KatzOnEarth	719443180450619392	2016-04-11T08:33:15	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina That chapter explains how foreign invasions and malfeasance created the conditions that make the quake deadly.
KatzOnEarth	719442928016470016	2016-04-11T08:32:15	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Maybe you don't know what the words you use mean? 
KatzOnEarth	719442815902740480	2016-04-11T08:31:48	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina You mean the part where I detail the torture, enslavement, racism and debasement that helped destroy the state?
KatzOnEarth	719442499719270402	2016-04-11T08:30:33	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Oh man. No, dear, that was a quote. Hence the quotation marks around it. This is so sad.
KatzOnEarth	719442328432349184	2016-04-11T08:29:52	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina You didn't read it, sweetheart. You just trust your friend. And that's beautiful. But she's misled you.
KatzOnEarth	719442233200656385	2016-04-11T08:29:29	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina I can see why you two are friends though. The same baseless name-calling. The same lack of evidence.
KatzOnEarth	719442094734094336	2016-04-11T08:28:56	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina And you're a coward and a fool who's picked a fight with someone he doesn't know for silly reasons.
KatzOnEarth	719441807256510464	2016-04-11T08:27:48	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina You haven't read it. I'm not making demands, I'm just explaining that you don't know what you're talking about.
KatzOnEarth	719441660791431168	2016-04-11T08:27:13	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina She's applied it to the book as a purity test. Except even that test doesn't hold up to scrutiny.
KatzOnEarth	719441529132228608	2016-04-11T08:26:41	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina She hasn't exposed anything. She has an angry little fantasy about a topic she knows nothing about.
KatzOnEarth	719441393232556032	2016-04-11T08:26:09	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Ah, an anti-semite. How did I guess.
KatzOnEarth	719441300689391616	2016-04-11T08:25:47	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina How exactly could I lie about what's in the book? Anyone can get a copy and see what's in it.
KatzOnEarth	719441084682747904	2016-04-11T08:24:55	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Instead you're just ranting about things you don't know. Which doesn't make you insane so much as ... well, sad.
KatzOnEarth	719440920454832128	2016-04-11T08:24:16	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Yes, it would be easy for you to check. You could read the book. Then you'd know what you were talking about.
KatzOnEarth	719440716242489345	2016-04-11T08:23:27	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Haha. Yeah, guilty as charged on that one.
KatzOnEarth	719440327543824384	2016-04-11T08:21:55	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina You could go to your library and read it yourself and see. Or don't. But then you can't make claims about it.
KatzOnEarth	719440189685374977	2016-04-11T08:21:22	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina No, comrade. I know what's in the book I wrote. She's lying to you about it. That's the difference.
KatzOnEarth	719439829445054464	2016-04-11T08:19:56	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina She's afraid to debate me, and with good reason. I've done the work and know what I'm talking about. She doesn't.
KatzOnEarth	719439422190653440	2016-04-11T08:18:19	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina She's a neoliberal shill who thinks all salvation comes from the West. Not to mention intellectually lazy.
KatzOnEarth	719439219714891776	2016-04-11T08:17:31	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina I've destroyed her so many times, it's a wonder she bothers to sign into her account. Hence her blocking me.
KatzOnEarth	719439077523734528	2016-04-11T08:16:57	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina You're such a delicate little flower.
KatzOnEarth	719438529722499072	2016-04-11T08:14:46	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Which you'd know if you bothered to read it. Which I know you won't. Or perhaps can't?
KatzOnEarth	719438393181085696	2016-04-11T08:14:14	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Or you know misquotes it, clips out of context, ignores the parts that blow up her theory and lies about the rest.
KatzOnEarth	719438218572251137	2016-04-11T08:13:32	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Tell me, do you have such strong opinions about other books you haven't read?
KatzOnEarth	719438122761764865	2016-04-11T08:13:09	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina That's unfair. I'm a very good imperialist propagandist. Otherwise why would the Rothschilds pay me so much?
KatzOnEarth	719437747342176256	2016-04-11T08:11:40	PhilGreaves01 Nah, I've found RedKahina to be an insufferable putz for a long time.
KatzOnEarth	719437447977897984	2016-04-11T08:10:28	PhilGreaves01 RedKahina Sure thing! Just send me a check signed "I DON'T READ BOOKS MYSELF, I JUST GO OFF WHAT PEOPLE TELL ME ON TWITTER."
KatzOnEarth	719417396449177600	2016-04-11T06:50:48	newsmite You might like it.
KatzOnEarth	719417353830862848	2016-04-11T06:50:37	newsmite Well, there you go. There were a lot of different motivations at play.
KatzOnEarth	719416989664616448	2016-04-11T06:49:11	newsmite No, I think it was mainly about imposing policy and showing power. Have you read the book, by chance?
KatzOnEarth	719416807648571392	2016-04-11T06:48:27	newsmite It would be hard to make a case for aid being blockaded considering how much was there. The US grossly misspent money though.
KatzOnEarth	719416392353759233	2016-04-11T06:46:48	newsmite was describing the American's motivation. But it's talking about the overall response, not just the US.
KatzOnEarth	719416137499484160	2016-04-11T06:45:47	newsmite Well, a lot of countries sent troops, but no. I'm saying that she is misrepresenting what that line was about. She implies it
KatzOnEarth	719415924474953728	2016-04-11T06:44:57	newsmite Calling it a blockade would be a stretch though, IMO. The US prioritized its own aid over others', no doubt. But tons got through.
KatzOnEarth	719415097521778688	2016-04-11T06:41:39	newsmite Before the quake, the average per day was seven.
KatzOnEarth	719415034405851136	2016-04-11T06:41:24	newsmite Yes. There were definitely planes diverted from the airport, which was under U.S. control. 140 flights landed a day though.
KatzOnEarth	719414382422306818	2016-04-11T06:38:49	newsmite And she claims on Twitter that MSF wasn't there, but of course they were. From their website: 
KatzOnEarth	719413493250801664	2016-04-11T06:35:17	newsmite The paragraph she quotes about the "primary purpose" then goes on to talk about Cuba, Mexico, Iceland and Luxembourg.
KatzOnEarth	719158616247431168	2016-04-10T13:42:30	Boston Globe joke headline: "Deportations To Begin" Boston Globe real headline 1/15: "Deportations Quietly Continue" 
KatzOnEarth	719407919427674112	2016-04-11T06:13:08	RedKahina TamrikoT Why don't you show them the Epilogue, Dmitrieff? Pages 277 and 278 in the Kindle version.
KatzOnEarth	719406750072483840	2016-04-11T06:08:29	RedKahina TamrikoT And criticizes the spending of money raised for Haiti outside Haiti. So again, you are lying to your followers.
KatzOnEarth	719406593994014720	2016-04-11T06:07:52	RedKahina TamrikoT The book repeatedly explains that it is necessary for govts and aid groups to spend money locally.
KatzOnEarth	719361890158276616	2016-04-11T03:10:14	KatzOnEarth AlecMacGillis Many grassroots folks have LGBT friends and relatives; fewer have loved ones from other races/classes. (3/3)
KatzOnEarth	719360665392177153	2016-04-11T03:05:22	KatzOnEarth AlecMacGillis Noticed this too. Didn't AriBerman note that NC's draconian voting restrictions didn't spark boycott? (1/3)
KatzOnEarth	719403454146473984	2016-04-11T05:55:23	RedKahina I love how, in your mind, I'm Bill Clinton.
KatzOnEarth	719403226248966144	2016-04-11T05:54:29	RedKahina And it'd show that I've done the work exposing the Military-Humanitarian-Industrial Complex, while you blather about nothing.
KatzOnEarth	719402910233321472	2016-04-11T05:53:14	RedKahina I notice you never quote Chapter 10 of my book, probably bc that's the part where I talk about how "aid" $$ actually gets spent.
KatzOnEarth	719402645610475520	2016-04-11T05:52:11	RedKahina I think you're pretty "fucking stupid," to use your term. You don't know how the aid industry works.
KatzOnEarth	719398956678127616	2016-04-11T05:37:31	That'd be a hell of a very special coming out episode though. 
KatzOnEarth	719398728646438912	2016-04-11T05:36:37	project_tweets pbump That may be the effect. Hard to say if it's the intention.

KatzOnEarth	719353985484898304	2016-04-11T02:38:49	A lot more celebs and corporate execs are LGBT than are racial minorities or working class? 
KatzOnEarth	719350421299531776	2016-04-11T02:24:39	Warriors, thanks. DM me the details. Do you need a mailing address or can I pick them up at Will Call? 
KatzOnEarth	719349230729633792	2016-04-11T02:19:56	newsmite No, TIME Magazine did.
KatzOnEarth	719348281655062528	2016-04-11T02:16:09	So, this makes no sense. Unless there's something else I'm missing, pbump?
KatzOnEarth	719348166328500224	2016-04-11T02:15:42	On the other hand, the Clintons have had a massive, disproportionate effect on other areas of the economy and political sector.
KatzOnEarth	719347639301615617	2016-04-11T02:13:36	As in: According to FAO, Haiti produces 36,000 metric tons of peanuts a year. According to WaPo, the "Clinton" project bought 120 tons.
KatzOnEarth	719346332473901056	2016-04-11T02:08:25	The partially Clinton-founded peanut project is a small piece of both peanut production in Haiti and their legacy there.
KatzOnEarth	719340703881498624	2016-04-11T01:46:03	meslippers alyssa011968 I was quoting the phrase to stress the militarized nature of the response, as the context makes clear.

KatzOnEarth	719333900569468928	2016-04-11T01:19:01	morningmoneyben Hey, we're already bankified the nation.
KatzOnEarth	719333418283245569	2016-04-11T01:17:06	RedKahina newsmite You seem to have trouble grasping how many non-American actors were there. Including MSF.
KatzOnEarth	719332942124818433	2016-04-11T01:15:12	RedKahina What do YOU think the primary purpose of that "aid" was? What was MSF trying to do? What was Cuba trying to do?
KatzOnEarth	719332830531174400	2016-04-11T01:14:46	RedKahina Let's stipulate for a second that there was a US blockade of "aid." (There wasn't, but let's pretend like there was.)
KatzOnEarth	719332408152231938	2016-04-11T01:13:05	RedKahina You dispute that Cuba's primary goal was to save lives? Interesting. What do you think Castro's angle was?

KatzOnEarth	719311684129714176	2016-04-10T23:50:44	alyssa011968 Thanks, I'll check it out.
KatzOnEarth	719311098315456512	2016-04-10T23:48:24	alyssa011968 Pages upon pages of argument and evidence I uncovered. She never seems to quote those parts.
KatzOnEarth	719310867167363073	2016-04-10T23:47:29	alyssa011968 And in the book, I go into detail about the billions of "aid" dollars diverted into military coffers and aid workers' salaries
KatzOnEarth	719309854603669504	2016-04-10T23:43:28	alyssa011968 She has a fantasy about a US aid blockade that didn't exist. The problems with the quake response went much deeper than that.
KatzOnEarth	719309639096082432	2016-04-10T23:42:36	alyssa011968 This is totally false though. I'm quoting TIME Magazine there, that isn't my term.
KatzOnEarth	719309065147572224	2016-04-10T23:40:19	RedKahina alyssa011968 You're cherrypicking. MSF was on the ground in Haiti when the quake struck, as MSF itself says over and over.
KatzOnEarth	719308657616384000	2016-04-10T23:38:42	RedKahina That is laughably untrue. No one gave anyone $3 billion to buy anything in Haiti.
KatzOnEarth	719308172356358144	2016-04-10T23:36:47	cordeliers RedKahina You can read the passages they hid from you and judge for yourself.
KatzOnEarth	719308044346200064	2016-04-10T23:36:16	alyssa011968 I think a lot of people throw in stuff about intentions as a shield against criticism. But actions speak louder than words.
KatzOnEarth	719299483012620288	2016-04-10T23:02:15	alyssa011968 I actually try to fight against the whole intentions thing in general, really. I don't think they ultimately matter much.
KatzOnEarth	719299283934134272	2016-04-10T23:01:27	alyssa011968 janetreitman I went deep on the Clintons here as well:

KatzOnEarth	719294907748380672	2016-04-10T22:44:04	cordeliers RedKahina Here's the fuller passage that Red is withholding from you. 
KatzOnEarth	719294519515197441	2016-04-10T22:42:31	cordeliers RedKahina Simply untrue. "Monster" there described Fran√ßois "Papa Doc" Duvalier, by the way.
KatzOnEarth	719294050352963584	2016-04-10T22:40:40	RedKahina JosMirek That would imply that the US wasn't delivering aid as well. But my main critique is that "aid" was the wrong frame.
KatzOnEarth	719293789697929216	2016-04-10T22:39:37	RedKahina JosMirek No, I quoted TIME Magazine's tellingly oxymoronic description of the invasion.
KatzOnEarth	719293585565335552	2016-04-10T22:38:49	RedKahina JosMirek See: 
KatzOnEarth	719293437154041857	2016-04-10T22:38:13	RedKahina JosMirek I didn't report them landing. I reported them responding. MSF says they took their first patient within three minutes.
KatzOnEarth	719292575321092097	2016-04-10T22:34:48	RedKahina JosMirek MSF was already in Haiti. They had multiple permanent bases, including Martissant and Delmas 19.

KatzOnEarth	719283779441963008	2016-04-10T21:59:51	RedKahina JosMirek That's the set-up. Then the rest of the chapter (the book, really), shows how that promise goes unfulfilled.

KatzOnEarth	719268595897909248	2016-04-10T20:59:31	RedKahina I apologize for the intrusion. Though I know you won't apologize for libeling me or admit that you were wrong, ever.
KatzOnEarth	719268504256581632	2016-04-10T20:59:09	RedKahina It's true that it's unfair for me to come and rebut a single uninformed reader just because she likes to libel me.
KatzOnEarth	719267738615685120	2016-04-10T20:56:06	RedKahina What the fuck does this refer to?

KatzOnEarth	719265583603310592	2016-04-10T20:47:33	RedKahina I know, you'd prefer to mischaracterize my work and libel me in places I can't see.
KatzOnEarth	719265299317551104	2016-04-10T20:46:25	RedKahina That's a good question. I think it's because I understand a bit where you're coming from, but then you pepper me with insults.

KatzOnEarth	714128125236535296	2016-03-27T16:33:07	elotroalex KatzOnEarth because of filter bubbles it also probably actually means 'why am I interested in this but no one I know is'

KatzOnEarth	714126930161889281	2016-03-27T16:28:22	When people say "why is no one reporting this" they mean "why am I not being inundated with this story like I am with all these others"
KatzOnEarth	714126724972355585	2016-03-27T16:27:33	But being mad at readers for not reading or CNN for not picking up my story for a day got me nowhere, and missed the point.

KatzOnEarth	705181697554452480	2016-03-03T00:03:12	Erin Burnett is portraying the GOP establishment as hateful and somehow unaware of Trump's popularity. Not one mention of Trump's ideas.
KatzOnEarth	705181424119377920	2016-03-03T00:02:07	I'm in a hotel room, so that means I'm watching CNN, which means I'm stunned again at how unabashedly pro-Trump this network seems.

KatzOnEarth	704843465939615744	2016-03-02T01:39:12	If we could just learn to keep that feeling all the time, and work together instead of tearing each other apart, we could do great things.
KatzOnEarth	704843196854104064	2016-03-02T01:38:08	.MiamiBookFair That when the world we live in is at its worst, people are often, amazingly, at their best.
KatzOnEarth	704842001959796741	2016-03-02T01:33:23	.MiamiBookFair There weren't many out when I started writing in early 2012. Which is probably good. Let me just go my own way.
KatzOnEarth	704840994580275200	2016-03-02T01:29:23	Also that I don‚Äôt see how tinkering around the margins is going to fix a system designed to preserve money and power as they are today.
KatzOnEarth	704840841760735232	2016-03-02T01:28:46	Might have something to do with the rum. 
KatzOnEarth	704840493226708993	2016-03-02T01:27:23	The problem with the aid system isn‚Äôt allocation. It‚Äôs that it isn‚Äôt designed to end poverty. So we need to design something that is.
KatzOnEarth	704840236568813568	2016-03-02T01:26:22	People have got to recognize that aid is not separate from other forms of policy. You can‚Äôt fix aid without fixing other gross disparities.
KatzOnEarth	704840013830344704	2016-03-02T01:25:29	I guess I‚Äôm getting impatient as I get older, but more and more my reflex is to start scrapping the whole thing. 
KatzOnEarth	704839748729380864	2016-03-02T01:24:26	The music is pretty uniformly amazing though. Hard to ever complain about that. Also the rum. Goddamn.
KatzOnEarth	704839638192668672	2016-03-02T01:23:59	The easy answer would be the people, but there are good and bad. Some amazing food, and some not so great. Some great memories, some not.
KatzOnEarth	704839428355842049	2016-03-02T01:23:09	What makes it harder about Haiti is that I try hard not to essentialize the place too much, which is an easy trap to fall into here.
KatzOnEarth	704839075447054336	2016-03-02T01:21:45	.MiamiBookFair That‚Äôs a deceptively tough question. I think I‚Äôd have a hard time answering it about anywhere I spend time, honestly.
KatzOnEarth	704838299978838016	2016-03-02T01:18:40	Oh, and uh, MBFKatz.
KatzOnEarth	704838092990062592	2016-03-02T01:17:51	Cheers. Though tbf I wasn't tied up with performing emergency surgeries or such (fortunately for all involved). 
KatzOnEarth	704837690798305281	2016-03-02T01:16:15	Thank you, sir. 
KatzOnEarth	704837412023881729	2016-03-02T01:15:08	Other things came out of contemporaneous notes as well. But the major bulk was written in 2012 for sure. Hard to write without a deadline.
KatzOnEarth	704837142577602561	2016-03-02T01:14:04	Great question. The heart of the earthquake scene itself is based on memories I wrote down within days of the quake. 
KatzOnEarth	704836670764535810	2016-03-02T01:12:12	The one thing that was similar was the timeframe. I wrote the whole thing in about eight months. That's wire-service speed.
KatzOnEarth	704836495992033285	2016-03-02T01:11:30	A lot more personal. And so much freedom. So much terrible, terrible freedom.
KatzOnEarth	704836332376424448	2016-03-02T01:10:51	Coming from the background I had as a wire service reporter it was ... pretty damn different. 
KatzOnEarth	704835350968066049	2016-03-02T01:06:57	The writing itself starts with the painful filling of pages, then the merciful rewriting of said pages over and over until they're less bad.
KatzOnEarth	704835058931273728	2016-03-02T01:05:47	Sure, that's easy to do in 140 characters. (Just kidding.) Well generally I start with an idea, then go report on it

KatzOnEarth	704830279463129090	2016-03-02T00:46:48	The Democrats are battling over ideas, policy and legacy. The GOP is battling over who can abuse human rights the most.
KatzOnEarth	704830013724565504	2016-03-02T00:45:45	This is great. It also feels like it's written about an entirely different country than the one the GOP race is in

KatzOnEarth	704755302026055684	2016-03-01T19:48:52	frankthorpNBC You could see why this might be confusing. It seems like he's denying having said it to people to whom no one says he said it
KatzOnEarth	704754830498254852	2016-03-01T19:46:59	frankthorpNBC Yes, but who is the "you" in ""I don‚Äôt remember saying anything like that to all of you"?

KatzOnEarth	704753393961664513	2016-03-01T19:41:17	frankthorpNBC Were you there when he said it initially?
KatzOnEarth	704752735929827328	2016-03-01T19:38:40	aaronleaf Yes, we just tweeted that almost simultaneously.
KatzOnEarth	704752623535132672	2016-03-01T19:38:13	Though I still suspect you have to at least be comfortable with bigotry to hear a Trump or Hannity say "be a bigot now" and respond "OK."
KatzOnEarth	704752085422751744	2016-03-01T19:36:05	This part of the article, by the way, is a good counterpoint to the more dismissive part of my little rant here. 
KatzOnEarth	704739976609714177	2016-03-01T18:47:58	But this is now and we are who were are today, so probably best to try to be honest about that, is my point of view. Anyway, read the piece.

KatzOnEarth	704739314660417536	2016-03-01T18:45:20	... or people for whom the mere concept of being asked to quietly respect those different from them is tantamount to suborning tyranny.
KatzOnEarth	704738727592116224	2016-03-01T18:43:00	This term of art also describes people who'd prefer to deny others happiness or even life because hurting them is easier than giving respect
KatzOnEarth	704738259176398854	2016-03-01T18:41:09	What do I mean by shitbag? I mean people who would rather destroy families and sanction murder than give up small amounts of unearned power.
KatzOnEarth	704738006796787712	2016-03-01T18:40:08	This is worth reading in full. But TL;DR the GOP spent decades luring bigoted shitbags who are taking over the party
