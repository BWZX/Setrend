Fibonacciqueen	722511285913391104	2016-04-19T19:44:48	MFerrato how about clase Azul reposada ?
Fibonacciqueen	722510878537551872	2016-04-19T19:43:11	With the timing cycles you watch for a possible reversal of whatever the trend is going into them but only if you see a trigger
Fibonacciqueen	722496451058671617	2016-04-19T18:45:51	stevegb67 at least protect yourself!......
Fibonacciqueen	722496257298554882	2016-04-19T18:45:05	SPX timing does not always turn the market, but it's worth watching...it was worth it in February! 
Fibonacciqueen	722493608377470976	2016-04-19T18:34:34	The short term cycles overlap this.....$INDU 
Fibonacciqueen	722492606391816192	2016-04-19T18:30:35	INDU timing cycles suggest you ratchet up stops on longs...these are the larger cycles
