POLITICO_Steve	701133872101257217	2016-02-20T19:58:36	That's because the people who arrive at caucus sites an hour-plus early are very different from those who get there 15 minutes before.
POLITICO_Steve	701133738311360513	2016-02-20T19:58:04	One quick note on entrance polls: The first entrance polls are even less predictive of the result than the first exit polls for a primary.

POLITICO_Steve	701133288476434433	2016-02-20T19:56:17	Pollsters focused on South Carolina this week -- and largely ignored Nevada. Here's why:
