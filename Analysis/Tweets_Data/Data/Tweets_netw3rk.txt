netw3rk	718552028281184256	2016-04-08T21:32:08	AnthonyIrwinLA I don't think so because he really did leave them with a ton of assets.
netw3rk	718551326901276673	2016-04-08T21:29:21	Hinkie stepping down now is brilliant though. If the team improves, he laid the groundwork. If they flounder, it's Jerry's fault.
