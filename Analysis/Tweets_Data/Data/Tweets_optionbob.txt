optionbob	692924683033927681	2016-01-29T04:18:13	Incredible price action in USDJPY NKD_F ES_F. I don't think this is what BOJ had in mind. Ugly reversal !!!
optionbob	692542775900921860	2016-01-28T03:00:39	Plenty of economic data coming out next couple of days to drive ES_F back to 1800. Fed blew it, again. Going lower. SPY
optionbob	692541640452497410	2016-01-28T02:56:08	I believe it is time to take profits in GLD and GDX. Better risk/reward is being short ES_F SPY. Fed wasn't dovish enough. Going lower.
optionbob	692122887176769536	2016-01-26T23:12:09	I believe the rally in gold is telling us market is positioned for a dovish FOMC statement. Huge downside risk if fed disappoints. SPY GLD
optionbob	691485895468277762	2016-01-25T05:00:59	My_Gavyy it would not have made a difference. it was a policy mistake and they will reverse at some point. The lower prices go, the sooner.
optionbob	691475632044138498	2016-01-25T04:20:12	My_Gavyy they did. keep in mind, the rally happened in Oct.
optionbob	691458028869066752	2016-01-25T03:10:15	My_Gavyy I am almost certain they do. Why didn't they raise in Sep but did in Dec. Economic data was sure not better. Price action was.
optionbob	691455767996551169	2016-01-25T03:01:16	With BOJ and ECB hinting at more stimulus and oil being squeezed higher, odds are we will see a rally ahead of FOMC meeting. Trouble. SPY
optionbob	691448472113819648	2016-01-25T02:32:16	Worst thing that could happen is a rally ahead of Tues/Wed FOMC meeting giving the Fed a false sense of security to stay course. SPY GLD

optionbob	691335551706791936	2016-01-24T19:03:34	Most important catalyst for the week: FOMC statement. If FED doesn't walk away from 3-4 rate hike idea, SPY and GLD will go a lot lower.
optionbob	690600951464374272	2016-01-22T18:24:32	Best move tim_cook could do, buy TSLA and make elonmusk CEO of APPL. Would fix so many things. Let's hope his ego is not in the way.

optionbob	690296124985384960	2016-01-21T22:13:15	It's beyond me why CNBC keeps on inviting fundstrat (Tom Lee) who clearly has no idea what he is doing.
optionbob	689927428999766016	2016-01-20T21:48:11	pvitha it was too much of a Captain Obvious point to turn. Rarely works. Gold will struggle until Yellen capitulates and calls off hikes.
optionbob	689927155166216193	2016-01-20T21:47:06	riggedmark3ts this will now not be enough. The next leg lower will probably take us to 1600ish.

optionbob	689925055480930304	2016-01-20T21:38:46	I believe today's rally off the lows is actually a bad thing. It is highly likely that we'll see ES_F sub 1800 shortly. SPY QQQ

optionbob	684847918793113602	2016-01-06T21:24:02	Love the risk/reward being long gold here. Rally likely to accelerate once it gets north of 1100. GLD GC_F GDX NUGT
optionbob	679014774772862977	2015-12-21T19:05:12	The fact that we can't get a true rally going after the Thur/Fri sell-off is very bearish. Next 100 handles are to the downside ES_F SPY
optionbob	677624699610865667	2015-12-17T23:01:32	The "advice" this Tom Lee dude fundstrat on CNBC is giving is downright dangerous. He has no idea what forces actually move prices. SPY
