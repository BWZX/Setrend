JohnCanally	705753356539711488	2016-03-04T13:54:47	Should also point out that roughly 125k fewer people were not able to work due to bad weather in Jan/Feb,which artificially boosts job count

JohnCanally	705748242277994496	2016-03-04T13:34:27	The oddity was the 0.1% mom drop in wages in Feb  which puts yoy gain at 2.2%.
