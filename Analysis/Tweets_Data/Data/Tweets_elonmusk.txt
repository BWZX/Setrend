elonmusk	688814634489413632	2016-01-17T20:06:21	Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating.

elonmusk	688175650570547202	2016-01-16T01:47:15	Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
