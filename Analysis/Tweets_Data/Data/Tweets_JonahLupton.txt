JonahLupton	724324065125773313	2016-04-24T19:48:09	JustinMarroquin ColinWayne1 has been open and honest about the bullshit happening at the company
JonahLupton	724323902906851328	2016-04-24T19:47:30	JustinMarroquin the Shredz marketing team even wrote most of the captions on their IG posts which is why they all sound so similar
JonahLupton	724318152226668544	2016-04-24T19:24:39	JustinMarroquin he didn't even know the password to his email accounts
JonahLupton	724318092797431808	2016-04-24T19:24:25	JustinMarroquin you were probably emailing with her assistant, Devin's assistant admitted that he never ever talked to a single client
JonahLupton	724317958231756800	2016-04-24T19:23:53	JustinMarroquin most of the Shredz people make themselves look approachable and friendly on social media but they're just greedy scammers
JonahLupton	724315808025980929	2016-04-24T19:15:20	JustinMarroquin Devin used to promote 15 minute Skype seasons for $500 --- what a scumbag
JonahLupton	724315717781348352	2016-04-24T19:14:58	JustinMarroquin so people are paying Paige $250-350 per month and getting some clueless jackass that's copy &amp; pasting plans
JonahLupton	724315550663479296	2016-04-24T19:14:19	JustinMarroquin there's a 0% chance she would have time to write/update 100s of plans per month
JonahLupton	724313542812422144	2016-04-24T19:06:20	JustinMarroquin I know that Paige has hundreds and hundreds of clients paying $300+ per month because they think they're getting her
JonahLupton	724312068371914755	2016-04-24T19:00:28	HaloTopCreamery your products available in stores or just online?
JonahLupton	724311925971161088	2016-04-24T18:59:54	JustinMarroquin hell yeah, social media can be very powerful
JonahLupton	724306297575890944	2016-04-24T18:37:32	JustinMarroquin every industry has their crooks, cheaters and scammers so it's up to everyone to expose them when possible
JonahLupton	724306193922011136	2016-04-24T18:37:08	JustinMarroquin exactly and it gives the good fitness people and online coaches a bad rap
JonahLupton	724301548889714688	2016-04-24T18:18:40	JustinMarroquin Arvin the CEO is a scam artist too, he's got a very suspect past and has fooled many people for a long time
JonahLupton	724301361848963072	2016-04-24T18:17:56	JustinMarroquin  I know for a fact that other Shredz people do the same thing...promote online coaching...but someone else does the plans
JonahLupton	724293224706244608	2016-04-24T17:45:36	JustinMarroquin he'd charge "clients" an outrageous $100 for his phone number to text him but the whole time they're texting his assistant
JonahLupton	724292983760281600	2016-04-24T17:44:38	JustinMarroquin I agree, people were paying him hundreds of dollars per month but it was his assistant doing all the work
JonahLupton	724290668315717635	2016-04-24T17:35:26	Luvabookworm devinphysique agreed, I hope his former clients get together and sue him.

JonahLupton	723655912502759424	2016-04-22T23:33:09	Shopping for jeans is definitely one of my least favorite things to do.
JonahLupton	723625937301049345	2016-04-22T21:34:02	DAVIDprice24 we got your back, it's a long season, just get back to dominating!!!!
JonahLupton	723605457135345666	2016-04-22T20:12:39	Just saw my first butterfly of 2016 which means Spring is officially here HappyEarthDay
JonahLupton	723596999652683776	2016-04-22T19:39:03	Phitness_Fill if I was paying $250 a month for meal/workout plans but talking to an unqualified assistant I'd be demanding a refund.
JonahLupton	723596851560218625	2016-04-22T19:38:27	Phitness_Fill agreed, she probably feels guilty that Devin made so much money and barely did any work, I'm sure his clients must be pissed
JonahLupton	723560081296621569	2016-04-22T17:12:21	airtime congrats on the relaunch, I think it sounds really awesome..."mobile chat room for groups of friends" &lt;&lt; love it
JonahLupton	723551164571258880	2016-04-22T16:36:55	Happy EarthDay everyone. Let's stop destroying our planet before it's too late. Keep her beautiful. 
JonahLupton	723525105960275968	2016-04-22T14:53:22	Firefighter4809 SwoleUniversity agreed, I'm glad the truth is finally coming out, those scam artists give the whole industry a bad look
JonahLupton	723523191721873408	2016-04-22T14:45:45	megmccarley jimmyjohns ashlaaaay_ it's 100% true
JonahLupton	723523153285275648	2016-04-22T14:45:36	Phitness_Fill i guess Devin still owes her money, I wonder if she's using this as leverage to make him pay up or she'll post a video 🤔
JonahLupton	723522966680666113	2016-04-22T14:44:52	Phitness_Fill agreed although I don't think she's going to be 100% honest because she's clearly scared of the blow back from Shredz
JonahLupton	723354353717940224	2016-04-22T03:34:51	Phitness_Fill are you on the Cali IG thread right now, approaching 3k comments, Devin's former assistant is talking some truth
JonahLupton	723326601891581952	2016-04-22T01:44:35	Phitness_Fill from Devin's former assistant 
JonahLupton	723324365895544833	2016-04-22T01:35:42	carlyXOvermette that would be me 😂😂
JonahLupton	723318837928693762	2016-04-22T01:13:44	This is genius 
JonahLupton	723316213032558592	2016-04-22T01:03:18	RyanSerhant $350+ million is incredible...you're a machine...keep it going...i'm addicted to the show...I'm pumped about the new season.
JonahLupton	723294457416835072	2016-04-21T23:36:51	fitgirlrepublic agreed, if someone wants to be lean and fit with some muscle then it's 40% workouts and 60% diet in my opinion
JonahLupton	723294225861844992	2016-04-21T23:35:56	fitgirlrepublic me too, it's my go-to website...I've ordered from a few others before but I forget the names.
JonahLupton	723292628318576641	2016-04-21T23:29:35	HaloSafety to be honest that's too young for any supplements, just tell him to eat more good foods especially high quality protein
JonahLupton	723290825459900418	2016-04-21T23:22:25	Phitness_Fill sounds good.
JonahLupton	723288981677420546	2016-04-21T23:15:05	fitgirlrepublic I'm in the process of relaunching my "online only" supplement company, our prices will be low because there's no middle man
JonahLupton	723288774432690176	2016-04-21T23:14:16	fitgirlrepublic just stick with your local nutrition store or 
JonahLupton	723288649920552960	2016-04-21T23:13:46	fitgirlrepublic from people I've talked to their stuff is decent but definitely over priced because you're paying for those commissions
JonahLupton	723288438145949696	2016-04-21T23:12:56	fitgirlrepublic I don't know much about Beachbody expect that there's tens of thousands of people pushing their products
JonahLupton	723288295397052416	2016-04-21T23:12:22	fitgirlrepublic I owned a supplement company for 2 years and I'd swear on a bible that it's the only products I used during that time frame
JonahLupton	723288171992240128	2016-04-21T23:11:52	fitgirlrepublic i guarantee none of their people even use the Shredz products yet they promote that crap so hard that it just seems sleazy
JonahLupton	723287972611784704	2016-04-21T23:11:05	fitgirlrepublic yeah probably, I know a couple people have dropped off the Shredz team because of all the bad stuff going around.
JonahLupton	723285364140548097	2016-04-21T23:00:43	fitgirlrepublic I've honestly never tried their products and never would, some people must like them but I know lots you don't
JonahLupton	723285093062721538	2016-04-21T22:59:38	fitgirlrepublic all of the above but the cookie cutter plans and fake 30-day challenges are the worst
JonahLupton	723283234579197952	2016-04-21T22:52:15	If anyone needs free supplement advice just let me know but please don't buy anything from the scammers at Shredz 
JonahLupton	723278256972148738	2016-04-21T22:32:28	Phitness_Fill I'm sick of all the fake nattys, if someone wants to use illegal crap then it's their call but don't claim you're all natural
JonahLupton	723277952188833792	2016-04-21T22:31:16	Phitness_Fill but I love when you call Joey a douche...him and Devin are definitely two of the biggest frauds in the fitness industry.
JonahLupton	723277867233206272	2016-04-21T22:30:56	Phitness_Fill watching the video now, you might want to shorten it up a little...

JonahLupton	723218250348130305	2016-04-21T18:34:02	Phitness_Fill but that won't stop me from trying to expose their scams...too many naive people out there getting screwed over
JonahLupton	723218120073203712	2016-04-21T18:33:31	Phitness_Fill although they love to creep on other pages and see who's talking about them
JonahLupton	723218038389149697	2016-04-21T18:33:11	Phitness_Fill it's funny that Devin, Joey, Paige and Shredz have all blocked me on IG even though I've never commented on their pages
JonahLupton	723217840120143873	2016-04-21T18:32:24	Phitness_Fill sounds good

JonahLupton	723192977586266112	2016-04-21T16:53:36	Phitness_Fill let me know, I'd be happy to share it and bring more awareness to all the shady stuff happening at Shredz
JonahLupton	723187416090181632	2016-04-21T16:31:30	Phitness_Fill I agree, I'm glad these scammers are finally getting exposed for all the shady stuff they've done.
JonahLupton	723127510280581120	2016-04-21T12:33:28	I think he did it wrong 
JonahLupton	723040444557438976	2016-04-21T06:47:30	BlondeVsWorld that's impressive
JonahLupton	723025278713401344	2016-04-21T05:47:14	iajay16 but I've talked to people who bought their crappy workout/meal plans and paid $200 to do their fake 30day challenges
JonahLupton	723025259012743168	2016-04-21T05:47:09	iajay16 I would never buy their garbage products...
JonahLupton	723024926144385025	2016-04-21T05:45:50	SamHall93 apparently some of his clients are suing him...Devin is a scammer...I bet Shredz cuts him within the next 30 days.
JonahLupton	723024549537820674	2016-04-21T05:44:20	SwoleUniversity I love watching Shredz get torched...their 30-day challenges with fake winners is despicable
JonahLupton	723024301335674880	2016-04-21T05:43:21	jsstrength I'm mad that all these IG accounts are getting shut down when all they're doing is exposing some scammers
JonahLupton	723023813743620096	2016-04-21T05:41:24	ColinWayne1 YouTube awesome video, appreciate the honesty 👌🏽
JonahLupton	723019800511959040	2016-04-21T05:25:28	iajay16 yes, I'm sure it's not because he likes their products but because they pay him really well
JonahLupton	722995841917685760	2016-04-21T03:50:15	ArmedNAllHeart Nutraspire there are too many supplement companies out there ripping people off and selling over priced crap
JonahLupton	722995706458419200	2016-04-21T03:49:43	ArmedNAllHeart Nutraspire very true but I miss running Nutraspire and giving people an affordable, reliable option for supplements
JonahLupton	722995510139871232	2016-04-21T03:48:56	ArmedNAllHeart Nutraspire thanks buddy
JonahLupton	722971607468244992	2016-04-21T02:13:58	GlenBurnsFit shredzarmy agreed
JonahLupton	722958671878172672	2016-04-21T01:22:33	I never publicly blast companies but seeing how Shredz aka ShredzArmy has been scamming people and running fake competitions...stay away!!
JonahLupton	721434242673176577	2016-04-16T20:25:01	Don't give up on your dreams!

JonahLupton	722595047418556416	2016-04-20T01:17:39	RagingBull300 we'd definitely want to sell our products at super affordable prices
JonahLupton	722594914106740736	2016-04-20T01:17:07	RagingBull300 yeah, companies selling fat burners and test boosters for $50 when they cost $3-4 to make...the margins are crazy
JonahLupton	722591183487246336	2016-04-20T01:02:17	RagingBull300 I love the supplement biz but it's gotten so competitive...lots of companies selling overpriced crap but have good marketing
JonahLupton	722589107956883456	2016-04-20T00:54:03	RagingBull300  exactly and by focusing on just a few products we can make them better and buy more inventory to drive down our costs
JonahLupton	722585698566606848	2016-04-20T00:40:30	Nene_90047 high protein, low carbs...no dairy/cheese, no bread/pasta/cereal, no cheat meals (at least until I'm under 230 lbs)

JonahLupton	721469500839849985	2016-04-16T22:45:07	I don't understand how some people can come to the gym smelling like they just smoked a joint. You should be at Taco Bell instead.

JonahLupton	720627686448750592	2016-04-14T15:00:03	I was just informed that most grated cheeses have cellulose (wood pulp) in them, this is disgusting. Stay away!!!

JonahLupton	720314923646107648	2016-04-13T18:17:15	Real_JMOOB actually turned out to be a blood clot in my upper leg, I'm 90% recovered now.
JonahLupton	720314808394981377	2016-04-13T18:16:47	JayVig Real_JMOOB Lversaci that's fine, discussions like this are usually pointless anyways, same with politics.
JonahLupton	720314689515872256	2016-04-13T18:16:19	@Krys_Danielle14 it's one of my goals someday to open a place like that.
JonahLupton	720311780958957568	2016-04-13T18:04:45	JayVig Real_JMOOB Lversaci  if the strike works and the employees get what they want it will probably lead to more layoffs
JonahLupton	720310662510067712	2016-04-13T18:00:19	JayVig Real_JMOOB Lversaci these are the same bozos that want $15 minimum wage because they feel entitled
JonahLupton	720310514484686848	2016-04-13T17:59:44	JayVig Real_JMOOB Lversaci but everyone should know this, doesn't take a genius to figure out, but striking is just ridiculous
JonahLupton	720310240328228864	2016-04-13T17:58:38	JayVig Real_JMOOB Lversaci Verizon management doesn't care about employees...only their jobs &amp; compensation by keeping shareholders happy
JonahLupton	720309925306572800	2016-04-13T17:57:23	JayVig Real_JMOOB Lversaci Verizon's businesses are barely growing so they need to cut expenses to show EPS growth
JonahLupton	720309741482876928	2016-04-13T17:56:39	JayVig Real_JMOOB Lversaci go work for private company or a small business or start your own business
JonahLupton	720309621773246464	2016-04-13T17:56:11	JayVig Real_JMOOB Lversaci nobody is forcing Verizon employees to stay; if you're unhappy then leave but striking is pitiful in my mind
JonahLupton	720309481427623936	2016-04-13T17:55:37	JayVig Real_JMOOB Lversaci that's how it goes, if someone doesn't like their employer maximizing profits then they should leave
JonahLupton	720309272123453440	2016-04-13T17:54:47	JayVig Real_JMOOB Lversaci companies like Verizon and all other public companies have a duty to maximize profits for their shareholders

JonahLupton	720239010355011584	2016-04-13T13:15:36	To the thousands of Verizon employees that went on strike today. Get your asses back to work. Millions are unemployed/homeless. Be grateful.

JonahLupton	719990280703881216	2016-04-12T20:47:14	HalfXmasguy_93 NBA I'm sure some teams will take it too far because they want the sponsorship money
JonahLupton	719990205885898752	2016-04-12T20:46:56	JeffLee ManicBlogher NBA it's all about the money
JonahLupton	719988369229496322	2016-04-12T20:39:38	Apparently the NBA just passed a rule allowing teams to put corporate sponsored logos on player jerseys. Seems ridiculous. Any thoughts?

JonahLupton	715420258744582144	2016-03-31T06:07:36	britt_wiggs did you like it?
JonahLupton	715412562112880640	2016-03-31T05:37:01	Shay1990 I need some right now
JonahLupton	715407762407038978	2016-03-31T05:17:56	MissKelsLynn I guess it's for better focus and it increases blood flow into the muscles
JonahLupton	715407609499504641	2016-03-31T05:17:20	MissKelsLynn same here, I started drinking pre-workout a few weeks ago for the first time in almost 2 years but it's still caffeine free
JonahLupton	715407404054093825	2016-03-31T05:16:31	MissKelsLynn *drinking
JonahLupton	715406426798104576	2016-03-31T05:12:38	MissKelsLynn yeah it is plus you don't wanna be driving coffee or pre-workout at night or you'll be up until 4am 😂
JonahLupton	715405978221420544	2016-03-31T05:10:51	MissKelsLynn it's been 10 days since I stepped into the gym and just 5 workouts in the past 21 days but i'm hoping to be back next week
JonahLupton	715405679079477248	2016-03-31T05:09:40	MissKelsLynn yeah even when I'm tired once I start lifting I can't stop, you get that rush of energy and endorphins
JonahLupton	715405473671880704	2016-03-31T05:08:51	yungbabylung I'm hoping to move back before summer, I just keep running into delays, the latest one was a blood clot in my leg 😳

JonahLupton	715381091855699968	2016-03-31T03:31:58	FoodNetwork you need to get rid of Mystery Diners, it's obviously fake and staged, the acting is horrible, it's just pathetic to watch

JonahLupton	714622926700548097	2016-03-29T01:19:17	SarahCochrann they literally do it anywhere including right in front of the dumbbell rack 😁
JonahLupton	714622810912649217	2016-03-29T01:18:49	SarahCochrann it's honesty one of the reasons I workout 4-6pm and not 7-9pm because this way I don't have to see them
JonahLupton	714620565059944448	2016-03-29T01:09:54	SarahCochrann that's never fun, I can't stand the couple at by gym that's always molesting and kissing each other

JonahLupton	713889346399641601	2016-03-27T00:44:18	Some people simply lack any common sense 
JonahLupton	713888761021603840	2016-03-27T00:41:58	MissKelsLynn 😂😂
JonahLupton	713815914056167424	2016-03-26T19:52:30	MissKelsLynn NC also has Cookout which is pretty good and they're open super late

JonahLupton	713200645617147905	2016-03-25T03:07:39	KichZenGoddess lack of brain cells
JonahLupton	713199788666265602	2016-03-25T03:04:14	jrdorkin I wonder what the averages are? Obviously it varies greatly by the market, expensive areas probably have more upside
JonahLupton	713199634366218240	2016-03-25T03:03:38	jrdorkin do you think the real numbers are much lower?
JonahLupton	713199555555229696	2016-03-25T03:03:19	jrdorkin BiggerPockets oh nice, I'm just intrigued with house flipping I guess but it does look like a lot of work and stress
JonahLupton	713199362046881796	2016-03-25T03:02:33	laquejadera1 that's an understatement

JonahLupton	713180103426109440	2016-03-25T01:46:01	nancy_jay25 gotcha, sounds interesting
JonahLupton	713179902963499009	2016-03-25T01:45:13	jrdorkin true, some of these flippers make it look easy and the money can be extremely lucrative...i'm tempted to try one later this year

JonahLupton	711650854894436354	2016-03-20T20:29:20	I'm all for the right to protest but if you're standing in streets and not letting cars get through you're an idiot and should be arrested.
JonahLupton	711608997422489600	2016-03-20T17:43:00	Hope you're having a better day then this kid 
JonahLupton	711499348379639808	2016-03-20T10:27:18	Good morning 😀 
JonahLupton	711419394933526528	2016-03-20T05:09:35	Bad idea 😂 
JonahLupton	711370006064447488	2016-03-20T01:53:20	JamieEverAfter QuestNutrition the 2 flavors in my picture are my favorite
JonahLupton	711355601662701568	2016-03-20T00:56:06	riagreiff  I'd recommend doing to the QuestNutrition website for that info
JonahLupton	711355473342164992	2016-03-20T00:55:35	Tessafitness QuestNutrition you can get them online or at most nutrition stores, my local GNC has them

JonahLupton	711155241849331713	2016-03-19T11:39:56	HaloSafety agreed that was an awesome game but the Michigan loss broke my heart
JonahLupton	711028659549806592	2016-03-19T03:16:57	This is basically what my week looked like 😜

JonahLupton	710700212650696704	2016-03-18T05:31:49	I only watched 10 hours of college basketball today 😳
JonahLupton	710666711658340352	2016-03-18T03:18:42	Real_JMOOB I'm definitely going to lose some strength and size in my legs but not much I can do about that now.
JonahLupton	710666591449518080	2016-03-18T03:18:13	Real_JMOOB yeah I'm gonna have to keep my diet perfect for the next few months since cardio won't be happening anytime soon
JonahLupton	710666378911555584	2016-03-18T03:17:22	Real_JMOOB yeah no kidding, tearing it in the gym would have been more fun 😁

JonahLupton	710662811748331520	2016-03-18T03:03:12	I've had so many injuries throughout my life but this torn calf muscle is easily the most painful 😩

JonahLupton	710534400820248578	2016-03-17T18:32:56	Shame on the refs in the Duke vs UNCW game. They've called so many bad fouls that this game has turned into a free throw shooting contest.
JonahLupton	710507252097130496	2016-03-17T16:45:04	Awesome to see uncwmenshoops giving dukeblueplanet some serious competition today. I miss Wilmington. Let's go Seahawks!!!! MarchMadness

JonahLupton	710261124227272704	2016-03-17T00:27:02	Katgear they definitely have a good shot at it, seems like at least 10 teams could take it all, it's a very even field this year
JonahLupton	710260897323819008	2016-03-17T00:26:08	sportstoughguy I probably should have picked more upsets (either way I always cheer for the underdog)
JonahLupton	710260803153338368	2016-03-17T00:25:46	sportstoughguy good choices, I hate Michigan state (because I'm a Michigan guy) but they have a legit chance to win it all.

JonahLupton	710240363127164929	2016-03-16T23:04:32	I was hoping to compete in my first bodybuilding show in 13 weeks but considering I now most likely have a torn calf muscle it's unlikely.

JonahLupton	709947594982686720	2016-03-16T03:41:11	From a recent tricep workout...one of my favorites is rope press downs for building mass and definition

JonahLupton	707783685186195456	2016-03-10T04:22:35	katie_dombrow just be careful, I have to go lighter for a while and stay away from certain exercises like flat bench press 😢

JonahLupton	707693212182388736	2016-03-09T22:23:04	Just finished a killer leg workout at the gym, now I'm enjoying two of my favorite things...protein shakes ... 
JonahLupton	707689580074553344	2016-03-09T22:08:38	jumrobe Houston already has a top defense so they just need an efficient QB who won't make big mistakes and can score 20+ points
JonahLupton	707689383743381506	2016-03-09T22:07:51	jumrobe agreed, without an elite QB a team has almost no chance of winning a title
JonahLupton	707689243246792704	2016-03-09T22:07:18	HelloLandie I wonder if this puts Brock in the top 10 highest paid
JonahLupton	707689190264348672	2016-03-09T22:07:05	jeff_goldenberg well Brady is definitely taking a pay cut so the team can put better players around him which i respect.
JonahLupton	707677121733332992	2016-03-09T21:19:08	This shows how desperate NFL teams are for a QB...Brock Osweiler plays half a season with Denver then signs a $72 million deal with Houston.
JonahLupton	707668474521391106	2016-03-09T20:44:46	Has anyone else ever had their massage therapist climb onto the table and use their knees? Was definitely a first for me 😂

JonahLupton	685508180189798400	2016-01-08T17:07:40	Bittersweet day for Gilt selling for $250M because a couple yrs ago were valued at $1B.  I wonder how many unicorns will be forced to sell.
JonahLupton	685477850514911234	2016-01-08T15:07:09	The iPhone 7 will support wireless charging and be waterproof 👍🏼
JonahLupton	685266738368397312	2016-01-08T01:08:16	The struggle makes you stronger.
JonahLupton	685200961258811392	2016-01-07T20:46:54	Always be a dreamer.

JonahLupton	684845639776256000	2016-01-06T21:14:58	If you want $100k to $300k of extra income while working part-time for @GetSoundGuard (10-15 hrs/week) then DM me 
JonahLupton	683141372514152448	2016-01-02T04:22:50	how cool is it that the same God that created mountains &amp; oceans &amp; galaxies &amp; puppies looked at u &amp; thought the world needed one of you too
JonahLupton	684568111144681472	2016-01-06T02:52:11	I hope this is real 👌🏽 
JonahLupton	684542574514798592	2016-01-06T01:10:42	connorsojourner people think I'm joking...the struggle is real 😩
JonahLupton	684541793933897728	2016-01-06T01:07:36	You know it's time to start stretching more when you pull your lower back muscles trying to get your socks on 🙈😆👎🏼
JonahLupton	684510558293495808	2016-01-05T23:03:29	F the haters. Don't let anyone stand in the way of your dreams and goals. Keep on hustling. 
JonahLupton	684462927466856451	2016-01-05T19:54:13	JustinMarroquin I agree but only if Edelman is 100% and the O-Line can keep Brady upright
JonahLupton	684442012590944256	2016-01-05T18:31:06	JustinMarroquin because of that I think Seattle and Carolina might be the two best, most balanced, most dangerous teams in the playoffs
JonahLupton	684441870206922753	2016-01-05T18:30:32	JustinMarroquin even though I'm a Patriots fan I'm very concerned about our injuries especially to the offensive line
JonahLupton	684427586915700736	2016-01-05T17:33:47	JustinMarroquin as the #6 seed it's very likely the Seahawks could be playing the Panthers in the divisional game
JonahLupton	684413439893221377	2016-01-05T16:37:34	Nolan_Frank1 I'd be very cool with that.

JonahLupton	684065637275152384	2016-01-04T17:35:31	HelloLandie UnderArmour not sure, I've never actually work high tops on leg day, I feel like they might give my ankle more support

JonahLupton	683413397321416708	2016-01-02T22:23:45	First time doing bench press in 6 months b/c of shoulder injury (been using dumbbells)...got 225 lbs x 24 reps. I'll be back @ 35 reps soon.

JonahLupton	683403403645587457	2016-01-02T21:44:03	_HaL3Y_ I might have to buy some oreo's tonight and test out this research for myself 😂
