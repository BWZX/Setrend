charltonbrooker	715119196309479424	2016-03-30T10:11:17	Then RadioTimes spoils it with one tweet. Almost as bad as this DVD cover:

charltonbrooker	705465076736761856	2016-03-03T18:49:15	In fact the ban makes it easier to unfairly misrepresent MPs - cos you're prevented from depicting the reality of what they actually said.
charltonbrooker	705464484702396416	2016-03-03T18:46:54	It's not like it benefits any party. We had to cut gags about both Corbyn and Cameron recently cos they relied on HoC footage, for instance.
charltonbrooker	705462411411775488	2016-03-03T18:38:40	charltonbrooker And they should all have the voice of Gerry Adams.

charltonbrooker	705462076702126080	2016-03-03T18:37:20	Maybe we should build a set and cast actors to play each MP for reconstructions. Like when Sky did the Michael Jackson trial.

charltonbrooker	705461349938237441	2016-03-03T18:34:27	tkingdoll yep
charltonbrooker	705461289468993536	2016-03-03T18:34:12	Also it's inconsistent. HIGNFY can't use clips from the House of Commons, whereas This Week can - with funny music dubbed on top.
charltonbrooker	705460295188275200	2016-03-03T18:30:15	Commons footage ban means they can't broadcast episodes of The Daily Show over here if they use clips from HoC.
charltonbrooker	705459988161011712	2016-03-03T18:29:02	We tried getting round it once by using footage from the Commons website. Got away with that for like a week.
charltonbrooker	705459682505265153	2016-03-03T18:27:49	The ban on UK comedy / satirical shows using Commons footage is just ridiculous...

charltonbrooker	690676269495762944	2016-01-22T23:23:49	At a guess I’d say it’ll happen every Friday for a few weeks. That’s how time works.
