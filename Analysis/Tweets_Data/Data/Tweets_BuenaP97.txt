BuenaP97	679471308384669696	2015-12-23T01:19:18	Macro_Tiger is the chart on your cover an NZD cross of some sort? The downspike is very signature of NZD's Augudt selloff reaction
BuenaP97	679425926531317760	2015-12-22T22:18:58	Copernicus2013 was quite a concern previously by some  how only the big tech names were 'holding the S&amp;P up'

BuenaP97	677162799324381184	2015-12-16T16:26:07	@GriTiger definitely within a rolling 2-month~ weekly range - but not sure we would see that kind of move (personally) post-Fed
BuenaP97	677162105666207749	2015-12-16T16:23:21	@GriTiger any thoughts behind it?
BuenaP97	676880623982747649	2015-12-15T21:44:51	Just for trolls it would be pretty funny if the fed just didn't hike tomorrow

BuenaP97	676046927704817664	2015-12-13T14:32:02	Is the LSE cost cutting? Used to have 4 terminals now only 3. &lt;\3

BuenaP97	675638329900167168	2015-12-12T11:28:25	sayfuji would be cool to see how other equity correlated FX crosses measure for up comparatively e.g. AUDJPY, USDJPY
BuenaP97	675331380692295680	2015-12-11T15:08:42	BuenaP97 other inflation swaps were following oil(US, EU) but maybe it does say something since those decoupled alreadg but JP still track?
BuenaP97	675331116941901824	2015-12-11T15:07:39	Chart from CS on the 5y5y JPY inflation swap tracking crude. Though jpy caring more about equities, Fed &amp; not BoJ
