joseiswriting	704912059566321664	2016-03-02T06:11:46	I would argue that she plays politics, which sucks the humanity out of most people. It'a a game. 
joseiswriting	704910434298630144	2016-03-02T06:05:18	Ask a liberal. I'm a humanist. 
joseiswriting	704906115138641920	2016-03-02T05:48:09	Let me be very clear: if you're currently calling black people "low information voters," I don't want to build a movement with you.

joseiswriting	704766193371095040	2016-03-01T20:32:09	Midday Edition speaking to joseiswriting on his new journalism venture, EmergingUS. 
joseiswriting	704756824491229184	2016-03-01T19:54:55	.joseiswriting covers a lot of ground with this response, all important.

joseiswriting	704763249628020736	2016-03-01T20:20:27	For all of social media's benefits amplifying marginalized voices, it still amplifies hottakes over analysis. 
joseiswriting	704762454513995776	2016-03-01T20:17:17	Among the reasons why I created emergingUS: we need more context and nuance in our reporting. 
joseiswriting	704762339518767108	2016-03-01T20:16:50	I think nuance and context get lost in soundbite-addicted conversation that we're accustomed to.

joseiswriting	704760254668500992	2016-03-01T20:08:33	So joseiswriting did a response to the Medium article, and that...was actually refreshing.  
joseiswriting	704758096841854976	2016-03-01T19:59:58	You may want to read what I wrote before making assumptions. Thanks. 
joseiswriting	704757824082075648	2016-03-01T19:58:53	Yep, I read it, and I responded to clarify why I tweeted what I did:  
joseiswriting	704756301893640194	2016-03-01T19:52:50	What an interesting comment.  
joseiswriting	704751378292482048	2016-03-01T19:33:16	We are all human beings. The struggle is being humane.  
joseiswriting	704746028101181440	2016-03-01T19:12:01	I would argue that for some Black people are still not humans; systematic racism still prevalent
