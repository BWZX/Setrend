NACMtrader17	726104313202880512	2016-04-29T17:42:13	how is it possible ppl are still using beats or misses to say whether an earnings season was strong or weak?
NACMtrader17	726103934947860480	2016-04-29T17:40:43	Cam, you know better than this. -7.1% y/y is in no way "solid."

NACMtrader17	726076884442841088	2016-04-29T15:53:13	i have no idea on the consumer there are salient points on both sides. FB earnings say exactly nothing about the state of the consumer
NACMtrader17	726076298515374080	2016-04-29T15:50:54	im still shocked at the retweet i saw yesterday that said FB earnings prove the consumer is strong?
NACMtrader17	726074420125679617	2016-04-29T15:43:26	correct me if im wrong but its monday the first day of the new month which = 401k allocations which = mutual funds putting money to work?
NACMtrader17	726068951634055168	2016-04-29T15:21:42	so this is pretty much exactly what we need in order to get to new ATHs
NACMtrader17	726066080473579520	2016-04-29T15:10:17	FinanceCam that my point - its so absurd its hardly worth the time to even care about it

NACMtrader17	721135603308343296	2016-04-16T00:38:20	MattGarrett3 no pressure cooker. Indirect heat in a 300 degree grill until 105 internal then seared to finish (127 internal) worked great.
NACMtrader17	721131505016176640	2016-04-16T00:22:03	Reverse sear method is the best way to cook this size cut.  Without a doubt.

NACMtrader17	721105957556723712	2016-04-15T22:40:32	griffinmcgee that's the plan. Gonna get my grill to about 300 and put it on the cool side. Let it get to an internal of 105. Then sear it

NACMtrader17	710521818906427392	2016-03-17T17:42:57	remember when all these ppl currently on CNBC telling you to buy oil and energy were on there before feb 11 saying the same thing?

NACMtrader17	703688472901476352	2016-02-27T21:09:40	20 or so unanswered points in about 7 min. That was ... Impressive HookEm
NACMtrader17	703687867663384576	2016-02-27T21:07:16	Texas run got to 22-0 before Buddy Hield ends 7-min scoring drought for Sooners, who are 1-of-last-10 FGs. TEXAS 74 ... OU 63 12 secs left

NACMtrader17	703686660236529665	2016-02-27T21:02:28	Kerwin Roach has played ELITE defense pretty much all second half on the National Player of the Year.
NACMtrader17	703685755734896640	2016-02-27T20:58:52	OU went ahead 58-51 with 7:26. That was almost six minutes of game time ago. Hasn't scored since.
NACMtrader17	703685466277548033	2016-02-27T20:57:43	Connor Lammert has been monstrous on the boards over the last 5 minutes.

NACMtrader17	703682562569302016	2016-02-27T20:46:11	It's like the refs were waiting for the crowd to boo before blowing the whistle

NACMtrader17	694598974565535744	2016-02-02T19:11:15	Since 2010, Texas 16 players drafted, Texas A&amp;M 14… I can do this all day.

NACMtrader17	694306473023660032	2016-02-01T23:48:57	Not_Raven only aggie refers to him that way. He won with Sherman's recruits. His 2013 class is a disaster. Now they pin all hopes on Chavis
NACMtrader17	694306119997476864	2016-02-01T23:47:33	Not_Raven he's going to be good. Wanted him at Texas and not really looking forward to playing against him for the next several yrs.
