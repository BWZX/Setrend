pkedrosky	710854709876097024	2016-03-18T15:45:44	evantindell My point is broader one, that Apple is part of a tech culture that sees its shibboleths as special snowflakes.

pkedrosky	689604214683623425	2016-01-20T00:23:51	Academy911 Great point.
pkedrosky	689604160585539584	2016-01-20T00:23:38	noCigar Evidence presented in court from multiple witnesses was that that was not the reason.
pkedrosky	689604036958380032	2016-01-20T00:23:09	noCigar I think Hammonds were thuggish and on wrong side of law, but prosecutors made poor choices on sensitive issues.
pkedrosky	689603699782451202	2016-01-20T00:21:48	Academy911 Will do.
pkedrosky	689603641976598528	2016-01-20T00:21:35	noCigar Seems fairly clear from evidence presented at trial they were trying a cover-up. 
pkedrosky	689603168917856256	2016-01-20T00:19:42	Academy911 Yeah, for sure. I just asked though. You made me curious for clarification.
pkedrosky	689602430959353856	2016-01-20T00:16:46	Academy911 Good question. Unclear.
pkedrosky	689601807912296448	2016-01-20T00:14:17	noCigar If you accept premise that Hammonds maliciously burned govt property, then unsurprising law used. Poor choice, but laws are tools.

pkedrosky	689597069380554752	2016-01-19T23:55:28	smartfootball Yes indeed. The decision to re-assign on page 20 is instructive and remarkable.

pkedrosky	689594891949604864	2016-01-19T23:46:48	noCigar Her decision was idiosyncratic and indefensible. The BLM/USFS issue is separate, and not clear "at odds" as seen by most ranchers.
pkedrosky	689594119618887680	2016-01-19T23:43:44	michaelscally Idiosyncratic and indefensible.
