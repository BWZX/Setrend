wmarybeard	721975409999495168	2016-04-18T08:15:26	rob_francis quite a lot of the stuff I had last night verged into the impolite (to put it politely!!)

wmarybeard	721819191330869252	2016-04-17T21:54:40	wmarybeard Oh, Mary. Of course you're not the problem. The irony of being lectured on safe spaces by people who fill this forum with bile.
wmarybeard	721818544216875009	2016-04-17T21:52:06	wmarybeard of rape occurs so frequently in classics it would be near impossible to always provide such warnings

wmarybeard	721814781485780993	2016-04-17T21:37:09	is this true? 
wmarybeard	721814201510010880	2016-04-17T21:34:50	abmulcairn stavvers depend what you mean by graphic.. try a lot of platus and trrence, the rape of lucretia, loads of ovids metamorphoses.

wmarybeard	721812920632532993	2016-04-17T21:29:45	abmulcairn stavvers on what particularly?
wmarybeard	721812003740893184	2016-04-17T21:26:06	wmarybeard With Euripides' Ion you end up with a scale of rape if you're not careful, with Creusa somehow different from Hephaestus/Athena.
wmarybeard	721812634937487362	2016-04-17T21:28:37	really? 
wmarybeard	721812389201620992	2016-04-17T21:27:38	stavvers abmulcairn thatnks everyone..shall sugest that every course has an automatic tw (art, lit, hist of antiquity all foreground rape)

wmarybeard	721810406528913408	2016-04-17T21:19:46	wmarybeard I've been trying to work out how you could compartmentalise rape into particular warned lectures for Classics; not doing well.
wmarybeard	721810950257524736	2016-04-17T21:21:55	odd_really thank you
wmarybeard	721810886395043840	2016-04-17T21:21:40	lornarichardson is it always kind, i do wonder..

wmarybeard	721809647573868546	2016-04-17T21:16:45	RJSHutton not complaining, just observing.. i have no personal right not to be offended
wmarybeard	721809464203075584	2016-04-17T21:16:01	stavvers abmulcairn think roman history! but you're neglecting different contexts, lectures, 1 to 1, seminars etc. diff. protocols needed.
wmarybeard	721808776408469506	2016-04-17T21:13:17	blimey; you get reported (semi-correctly) as being no fan of 'safe spaces', then you get evening's mauling on twitter. if i'm the enemy....
wmarybeard	721808157828390912	2016-04-17T21:10:50	stavvers abmulcairn sure... and there are many ways of that being possible
wmarybeard	721807811815059456	2016-04-17T21:09:27	abmulcairn stavvers of course not, and by the time you get to my sge you are pretty sensitive to the differences, i assure you
wmarybeard	721807498773139456	2016-04-17T21:08:12	Morgan_GF_ stavvers 4nks well fine, if that helps... but it did sound a bit patronising!

wmarybeard	721806916352110597	2016-04-17T21:05:54	Morgan_GF_ stavvers 4nks sorry you're  patronising now..have various ways of facing this, &amp; helping students do likewise. you work in HE?
wmarybeard	721806424368615424	2016-04-17T21:03:56	stavvers 4nks and i avoid garibaldi biscuits.. raped by a neapolitan biscuit factory architect. but my aim is to strengthen students.
wmarybeard	721805974449889280	2016-04-17T21:02:09	stavvers 4nks i am not sure quite how much you know about my teaching, my subject, students, uni...mad to suggest that i dont see issues
wmarybeard	721805586992668677	2016-04-17T21:00:37	stavvers 4nks not if the students decide not to show

wmarybeard	721804956110602241	2016-04-17T20:58:06	4nks stavvers want to know the happy end of a roman comedy? the rapist turns out to be the girls fiancee. this is about degree zero gender
wmarybeard	721804616346767364	2016-04-17T20:56:45	4nks stavvers exactly.. our struggle as been to make people see what is at stake in this, why it is important...
wmarybeard	721804399543263236	2016-04-17T20:55:53	stavvers 4nks evidence from my university??
wmarybeard	721804195700084742	2016-04-17T20:55:05	stavvers 4nks we try to give students intellectual and personal resources for facing this stuff.. that is the job
wmarybeard	721803926882926592	2016-04-17T20:54:01	stavvers 4nks so student absents, and the next time, and the next time...choose another degree?  have you read any ancient 'comedy"?

wmarybeard	721802453017038849	2016-04-17T20:48:09	stavvers 4nks it took us 100s of years to say these were rapes (not just abduction/seduction)..that was bravery against trad establishment
wmarybeard	721802115203612672	2016-04-17T20:46:49	stavvers 4nks sorry, not just rape of sabines, rape of lucretia, of virginia etc. almost all ancient political change = violence gst women
wmarybeard	721800742189838337	2016-04-17T20:41:22	Morgan_GF_ stavvers do you think i dont...??

wmarybeard	721799907791740928	2016-04-17T20:38:03	Inkysloth stavvers i fear that may be true, but facing classical culture means facing exactly that
wmarybeard	721799473530281984	2016-04-17T20:36:19	Waitingirl13 i was not talking about effort.. honestly. do you teach in HE I wonder?
wmarybeard	721799225600827394	2016-04-17T20:35:20	yllekch not inaccurate but partial: report taken from another report. give us break/benefit of doubt.  may disagree on detail not substance
wmarybeard	721798450136903681	2016-04-17T20:32:15	stavvers had you seen full transcript, you'd have seen that i wasnt million miles away..but it's more complicated (after 40 years in HE)
wmarybeard	721797810123882496	2016-04-17T20:29:42	Waitingirl13 what?? hang on , what do you mean by no empathy...?
wmarybeard	721796488196534272	2016-04-17T20:24:27	Meanwhile, "right-wing newspaper lies about known left-wing woman and everyone sells her out" is definitely never a thing that has happened.

wmarybeard	721796227671699457	2016-04-17T20:23:25	stavvers i wonder how it's possible to engage with early roman history without facing rape (i write as one of many who has been raped)
wmarybeard	721795120018939904	2016-04-17T20:19:01	stavvers yes as a simply tick box exercise, as it is very hard to judge the nature of the threat or whatever.. as i said

wmarybeard	706047948753399808	2016-03-05T09:25:23	pompei79 My current rule: if I WRITE briefing, ask for fee;just talk is free, PROVIDING evidence that researcher has already done some work
wmarybeard	706047069274972160	2016-03-05T09:21:53	pompei79 It's minefield, as so much info's commonly held. I feel clash, as am often asked too, btwn wanting to help &amp; and not just for free
wmarybeard	706044520174133248	2016-03-05T09:11:45	pompei79 I think that is a real issue. And there is a clash between wanted expertise and exploiting expertise. Not sure of solution

wmarybeard	705850185478488064	2016-03-04T20:19:32	UlyssesMcEwan hard line to draw (eg at pompeii new roofs needed to preserve). But I dont like fake rebuild.

wmarybeard	705824449791135744	2016-03-04T18:37:17	deantrichardson nt sure I have any pull here! but I will find out the state of play
wmarybeard	705824179728359424	2016-03-04T18:36:12	griffinf123 they are very helpful &amp; offer access to academics wanting to see stuff. TV is maybe bit easier, but i have never had a problem
wmarybeard	705820697248010241	2016-03-04T18:22:22	DuncanDrew2 I like any bits where you can just wander down backstreets.. and feel back in time
wmarybeard	705817554149908481	2016-03-04T18:09:53	atterss sadly not!
wmarybeard	705816278431342592	2016-03-04T18:04:48	atterss some certainly did that, but if we are dealing with 40 + that isnt possible.. the attic or the basement are obvious places
wmarybeard	705812990302543872	2016-03-04T17:51:44	ClareKrasinski thanks.. its quite tough pitching it right for kids isnt it!
wmarybeard	705812794193612800	2016-03-04T17:50:58	atterss but all these things are more fluid than they seem!
wmarybeard	705812688111280128	2016-03-04T17:50:32	atterss elimination really. looks more than store rooms &amp; slaves must live somewhere! + proximity to kitchen &amp; analogy with Hadrians villa
wmarybeard	705797661962719232	2016-03-04T16:50:50	LysaStreet a cart could actually pass through.. as the ruts in the streets show. (must had same wheel span!)
wmarybeard	705794027879325696	2016-03-04T16:36:23	wmarybeard Loved your programme last night! Do you know about loveitaly_org's Pompeii crowdfunding project?

wmarybeard	705768980670189568	2016-03-04T14:56:52	WildPaw yes... but the further you go back in time with rediscovery, the more 'cosmetic' work you are likely to find

wmarybeard	705708591014146048	2016-03-04T10:56:54	DancingHermit supposed to mimic vesuvius! put up to display the casts, temporarily.
wmarybeard	705706432390438912	2016-03-04T10:48:19	HWattsAuthor probably the absence of 'childhood' as a category in our terms... just mini adults
wmarybeard	705705882231906304	2016-03-04T10:46:08	brilliant to know that the Romans (&amp; THEY are the stars) are still so watchable.. thanks to all who joined us!

wmarybeard	705678266548367360	2016-03-04T08:56:24	WildPaw truth is none of these things are quite as exactly where they should be as is often said, but basically they are
wmarybeard	705675892568276992	2016-03-04T08:46:58	joshspero Astroclassicist yes polybius is a bit of a hero in spqr
wmarybeard	705670059952316416	2016-03-04T08:23:47	WildPaw it is essentially true. But there has been a bit of tidying and rearrangement that is right.

wmarybeard	695921587904716800	2016-02-06T10:46:50	R_McCormack BriW74 holland_tom and that women buy male writers for men

wmarybeard	693031245761093632	2016-01-29T11:21:39	QuiltyFeeling please dont prejudge on the basic of this one statue argument. Not quite fair I think.
wmarybeard	693024889893163008	2016-01-29T10:56:24	mattlodder a great sentence! Elgin marbles is another contested boundary. ( not only factor tho .. Complex semiotics)
wmarybeard	693020171527655424	2016-01-29T10:37:39	mattlodder yes.. but the dividing line is inevutably negotiable (and not the only factor of course)
wmarybeard	693018302017376256	2016-01-29T10:30:13	mattlodder well it is partly time, and that fluid, shifting boundary between past and present.
wmarybeard	693014567287398401	2016-01-29T10:15:23	mattlodder thanks. I dont think either side is silly; but some people  seem to imagine wanting to preserve statue is sign of moral failing!
wmarybeard	693013338402455552	2016-01-29T10:10:30	mattlodder Am not so sure. I see arguments for removing Rhodes, not 'disappointed' that anyone holds them. I simply disagree with them.

wmarybeard	692998650964905984	2016-01-29T09:12:08	dannybirchall about the statue, no. The pressing issue is how racism (and other forms of discrimination) in the academy is addressed.
wmarybeard	692998189335592960	2016-01-29T09:10:18	peterfrankopan mattlodder alexvtunzelmann CRIMINALLY useless.Raises question of where present stops &amp; 'history' starts (Caesar genocidal)
wmarybeard	692997464043974656	2016-01-29T09:07:25	mattlodder The semiotics of public sculpture is MUCH more complex than that! It would be nice if it was so simple, but it aint.
wmarybeard	692997144228335616	2016-01-29T09:06:09	dannybirchall hang on, it was a 'have you stopped beating your wife question'. Challenge was that I lived in entirely white world. Wrong.
wmarybeard	692996546812579840	2016-01-29T09:03:46	mattlodder There's tendency to assume if you dont want statue removed you 'approve' of Rhodes.Different views of function of public statues
wmarybeard	692990702255521792	2016-01-29T08:40:33	mattlodder Depends on context &amp; timing.But to assume you can't BOTH deplore racism in academy AND not want Rhodes statute removed is wrong

wmarybeard	692305905128476673	2016-01-27T11:19:24	TorquilMacneil BBCWomansHour certainly the latter... and the question of whatever role someone called 'Homer' played is open!
