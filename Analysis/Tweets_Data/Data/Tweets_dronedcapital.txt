dronedcapital	711919530218545154	2016-03-21T14:16:57	Who knows if they can replicate that level of success with the next acquisition(s). (3/n)
dronedcapital	711919041988960257	2016-03-21T14:15:01	Pharmasset turned out to be a terrific acquisition. Maybe better than anyone could have imagined at the time. But, (2/n)
dronedcapital	711918917216837632	2016-03-21T14:14:31	Each time I hear someone talk about GILD (which I own) they mention what great capital allocators they are due to the Pharmasset deal (1/n)

dronedcapital	692474150645055490	2016-01-27T22:27:57	@AxGlobalAdv Obviously this is going to be a recurring industry theme but at 8x earnings, huge FCF and excellent mgmt I'll take my chances.
