DavidSchawel	703589747076284417	2016-02-27T14:37:22	nosunkcosts TheStalwart BlondBanker maybe so, I was merely talking impact to financials for an immediate all else equal move

DavidSchawel	703586844743696384	2016-02-27T14:25:50	nosunkcosts TheStalwart BlondBanker that's not what my response to Joe said, simply saying asset yields will fall &amp; COF will fall less

DavidSchawel	703583994227650560	2016-02-27T14:14:30	TheStalwart look at banks from an asset/liability perspective, asset yields keep repricing lower &amp; can no longer reprice borrowings
DavidSchawel	703582392175321088	2016-02-27T14:08:08	TheStalwart IMO going negative should mean the same as any marginal drop in rates for financials (0 to -0.25 same as 0.50 - 0)

DavidSchawel	689230663204077568	2016-01-18T23:39:30	mark_dow modestproposal1 fwiw, I'm not saying I definitively know, it's just a fun topic to discuss &amp; state theories
DavidSchawel	689230381644644352	2016-01-18T23:38:22	modestproposal1 obviously depends but I'd prob say, if someone's cutting, longer term rosier than current - so steep
DavidSchawel	689229006588215296	2016-01-18T23:32:55	modestproposal1 I think we agree on the influencing factors, maybe not on degree that each factor has in aggregate
DavidSchawel	689227901280088064	2016-01-18T23:28:31	modestproposal1 there's many people in both camps on those questions
DavidSchawel	689227678931677184	2016-01-18T23:27:38	modestproposal1 not necessarily- because the asset swap reduces supply &amp; injection of reserves creates hot potato to enhance demand
DavidSchawel	689227100801363969	2016-01-18T23:25:20	modestproposal1 is it stimulative to growth/inflation?Issue in all cases is lack of counterfactual.That yields would b lower is interesting
DavidSchawel	689225456927817728	2016-01-18T23:18:48	modestproposal1 Of course, it's more of response to the charts which show what yields do during the diff times (like it's an on/off switch)
DavidSchawel	689225153163710464	2016-01-18T23:17:36	modestproposal1 that's a fair opinion for sure
DavidSchawel	689224999060815874	2016-01-18T23:16:59	modestproposal1 It doesn't matter what you or I believe, the evidence we have is that the Fed bought X bonds &amp; yields are down Y since
DavidSchawel	689224331428282368	2016-01-18T23:14:20	modestproposal1 so unless you believe 10y yields would be even lower today, the whole body of evidence says it lowered yields
DavidSchawel	689223847049064448	2016-01-18T23:12:24	modestproposal1 I've never bought this argument/chart. Since QE began, 10y yields down 100-150bps &amp; Fed still owns the bonds they bought.
