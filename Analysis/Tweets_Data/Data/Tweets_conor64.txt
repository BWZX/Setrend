conor64	725526905240211458	2016-04-28T03:27:48	ReaderAdrift The article does not say or imply that they walked into the dining hall and started screaming in a chef's face

conor64	725525047578750977	2016-04-28T03:20:25	ReaderAdrift This is why I didn't respond to you about this before--you take a person I quoted, somehow cite it to fault me, despite fact
conor64	725524714953691136	2016-04-28T03:19:06	ReaderAdrift Who is it, do you think, that prepared the rice?
conor64	725524656942280705	2016-04-28T03:18:52	ReaderAdrift How is complaining about undercooked rice aimed at the parent company as opposed to the dining hall workers?
conor64	725523835437481985	2016-04-28T03:15:36	ReaderAdrift No, what I said is, I don't understand how you can reach the conclusion that they didn't berate them.

conor64	725523278001897472	2016-04-28T03:13:23	ReaderAdrift Yes, again, berate means "to scold or criticize angrily." And in convos w/ students &amp; quotes in my piece, they are, in fact,
conor64	725522243921412096	2016-04-28T03:09:17	ReaderAdrift This is, I've got to add, a pretty weak example of me "flirting w/ the dark side."
conor64	725522016908931072	2016-04-28T03:08:23	ReaderAdrift Oberlin kids didn't angrily scold, or "berate," the dining hall workers.
conor64	725521802554806273	2016-04-28T03:07:31	ReaderAdrift Another student complained that undercooked rice was disrespectful. I'm not really understanding how you think that Oberlin

conor64	725521106233229317	2016-04-28T03:04:45	ReaderAdrift But berate means "to scold or criticize angrily." Didn't the Oberlin kids angrily scold the dining hall workers?

conor64	707421132303900672	2016-03-09T04:21:55	RonSchweinlach And Yale students who disagreed w/ protesters had a range of reasons and motivations too
conor64	707421056886112256	2016-03-09T04:21:37	RonSchweinlach Some Yalies protested out of frustration w/ personal experiences; some out of solidarity; some were driven by ideology
conor64	707419892211851268	2016-03-09T04:17:00	RonSchweinlach First of all, they're distinct individuals who aren't all driven by the same thing!
conor64	707419548945764352	2016-03-09T04:15:38	RonSchweinlach I got orders of magnitude more praise for that article--from people of all colors--than criticism, FTR.
conor64	707417489659932673	2016-03-09T04:07:27	RonSchweinlach You seem more interested in criticizing me than conversing. I'm not sure why.
conor64	707417259044503552	2016-03-09T04:06:32	RonSchweinlach I'm not sure what the criticism is even supposed to be. That I don't know what it's like to be black at Yale? Certainly true
conor64	707417108850737152	2016-03-09T04:05:56	RonSchweinlach The closest I personally can come to understanding what being a minority is like was living abroad. But either way
conor64	707416713357189121	2016-03-09T04:04:22	RonSchweinlach been first to post that video or not, but at that point it seemed like an easy call.
conor64	707416611993464832	2016-03-09T04:03:58	RonSchweinlach By the time I published the video was on the front page of Reddit, in the YDL, linked in NYT. I don't know if I would've
conor64	707412884075098112	2016-03-09T03:49:09	RonSchweinlach they're the same, and monolithic, when neither is true.
conor64	707412814223114240	2016-03-09T03:48:52	RonSchweinlach And "students of color" as a term has the unfortunate effect of treating, for example, black and Hispanic opinion as if
conor64	707412660363526145	2016-03-09T03:48:15	RonSchweinlach There are black students at Yale who disagreed with them, white students at Yale who protested, etc
conor64	707412513822904322	2016-03-09T03:47:41	RonSchweinlach causing you to disparagingly label my qualification a sleight of hand.
conor64	707412430066855936	2016-03-09T03:47:21	RonSchweinlach Again, no frustrated black or Hispanic students write you emails like that, so you're blind to the concern
conor64	707412321425993728	2016-03-09T03:46:55	RonSchweinlach I get emails from students of color emphatically objecting, highlighting diversity of opinion among students of all colors
conor64	707412178047860736	2016-03-09T03:46:20	RonSchweinlach It's not a sleight of hand. Campus progressives often act like they are the voice of "students of color." And every week,
conor64	707412001522196480	2016-03-09T03:45:38	RonSchweinlach There is no other plausible interpretation of the superlative construction.
conor64	707411434343247872	2016-03-09T03:43:23	RonSchweinlach Maybe it's your disagreement w/ my larger world view that's blinding you to what I'm actually saying.
conor64	707411325777895424	2016-03-09T03:42:57	RonSchweinlach roughest of all. which is completely contrary to the statement you characterized me as making as evidence of obtuseness
conor64	707411216503713792	2016-03-09T03:42:31	RonSchweinlach It explicitly says that, compared to CA students, racial and ethnic "others" have it rougher--in fact, it says they have it
conor64	707411125889998848	2016-03-09T03:42:10	RonSchweinlach Here is the graf you're talking about 
conor64	707410514180120577	2016-03-09T03:39:44	RonSchweinlach Maybe this will help you understand why I find your critiques frustrating. U say I equate CA going east w minortiy students
conor64	707405801300697088	2016-03-09T03:21:00	RonSchweinlach jttiehen your understanding of my work, as well as FIRE's work, is skewed and incomplete.
conor64	707405706589118464	2016-03-09T03:20:38	RonSchweinlach jttiehen being spied upon--and FIRE has done lots of work for students like that. Basically,
conor64	707405576997724160	2016-03-09T03:20:07	RonSchweinlach jttiehen that have nothing to do with it's thesis. I wrote about Occupy protesters being abused by police, Muslim students
conor64	707405414464299008	2016-03-09T03:19:28	RonSchweinlach jttiehen And while I do think the Atlantic cover story made important points, I have defended lots of students in instances
conor64	707405120858755072	2016-03-09T03:18:18	RonSchweinlach I had a piece half-written about that Missouri bill. Then, it was withdrawn the next day. That's why no one wrote about it
conor64	707400518834913280	2016-03-09T03:00:01	jttiehen RonSchweinlach I do think, however, that it should be on our radar, and that we should never try to get mobs to target people
conor64	707400383971270657	2016-03-09T02:59:29	jttiehen RonSchweinlach might strike is a very thorny question, and I don't think any of us has a clear answer or perfect judgment
conor64	707400290366922753	2016-03-09T02:59:06	jttiehen RonSchweinlach And it isn't like video is the only thing that triggers it. How much we should change our behavior in case trolls
conor64	707400062129733633	2016-03-09T02:58:12	jttiehen RonSchweinlach instances of Internet mobs turning on individuals, I find it very hard to predict when it will happen
conor64	707399900850302976	2016-03-09T02:57:33	jttiehen RonSchweinlach Again, I don't think student humiliation or doxing  was as predictable as you're assuming. As someone who studies
conor64	707398700650266624	2016-03-09T02:52:47	RonSchweinlach jttiehen It's a tricky ?, one for which we don't have good norms yet. I think about it every time I deal w/ a police video
conor64	707390107943174146	2016-03-09T02:18:39	jttiehen RonSchweinlach odds are, whoever is around, a student shouting at a professor in a crowd is gonna be recorded these days.
conor64	707390000162189314	2016-03-09T02:18:13	jttiehen RonSchweinlach The situation seems pretty sui generis. in 16 years of operation I don't think another example exists. And
conor64	707389629469569025	2016-03-09T02:16:44	jttiehen I think a college president saying, "Student has every right to say x, but I disagree with that for these reasons..." is fine.
conor64	707389325017624576	2016-03-09T02:15:32	RonSchweinlach w/ posting video and saying, "person x calling for person y's firing treated x unfairly--see for yourself."
conor64	707389183833157632	2016-03-09T02:14:58	RonSchweinlach In hindsight, perhaps YDL, Greg, and others would've done it that way, but I don't think there's anything inherently wrong
conor64	707388110678597632	2016-03-09T02:10:42	RonSchweinlach Lots of students had their phones out recording; Yale Daily News posted video; don't think any expected her to get doxxed
conor64	707387895976333313	2016-03-09T02:09:51	RonSchweinlach And if you look at the video you'll see that Greg was hardly alone in recording it
conor64	707387775247450113	2016-03-09T02:09:22	RonSchweinlach jttiehen 3) the content of the student's words and the ideology behind them were worth examining
conor64	707387655655272449	2016-03-09T02:08:54	RonSchweinlach jttiehen 2) The activists were trying to get the professor fired; his calm, respectful demeanor in video was good defense
conor64	707387540517445632	2016-03-09T02:08:26	RonSchweinlach jttiehen 1) It's the best way to convey what actually happened that day.
conor64	707387432891604992	2016-03-09T02:08:01	RonSchweinlach jttiehen There were lots of reasons to take and post the video besides playing on emotions. Here are some of them:
conor64	707370430479278080	2016-03-09T01:00:27	I hate it when I end up having to agree with Conor Friedersdorf. Yet here we are.
