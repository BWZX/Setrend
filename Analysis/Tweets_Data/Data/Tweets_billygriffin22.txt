billygriffin22	694200811925057537	2016-02-01T16:49:05	MrPABruno Most people have some fairly narrow prefs around living situation, &amp; some reasonably constrained monthly cash outlay.
billygriffin22	694200546429800448	2016-02-01T16:48:02	MrPABruno Do you mean, $800 to rent this 1br apartment &amp; ‚Äúinvest the rest‚Äù vs. have $2500 mortgage 5br house in suburbs? Nobody does that.
billygriffin22	694200057881448448	2016-02-01T16:46:06	MrPABruno Well depends, but yes, that‚Äôs spot on for 90+% of comps.
billygriffin22	694199868374450176	2016-02-01T16:45:20	MrPABruno But point is that it‚Äôs a false choice to say ‚Äústocks are better financial investment.‚Äù Of course they are, it‚Äôs irrelevant.
billygriffin22	694199683833421824	2016-02-01T16:44:36	MrPABruno E.g. If you live in SF or NYC, your calculus will be vastly different than KC or Denver.

billygriffin22	694198282877140993	2016-02-01T16:39:02	MrPABruno I think the buy vs rent decision is more than purely a financial decision, but in only ~5 cities today is renting ‚Äúbetter deal.‚Äù
billygriffin22	694197909114359809	2016-02-01T16:37:33	MrPABruno Exactly. His argument was ‚Äúwell stocks go up more than RE.‚Äù Find me a less useful argument than that.
billygriffin22	694196973256122369	2016-02-01T16:33:50	MrPABruno Except his very first argument makes incredibly lazy assumptions. See my last few tweets on this.

billygriffin22	694191173393453056	2016-02-01T16:10:47	Yes, stocks go up more than RE, but underlying assumption is flawed, that if you rent instead of buy, you have *more* $ to invest in stocks.
billygriffin22	694190694840139776	2016-02-01T16:08:53	Easy argument to make, but idea that ‚Äústocks go up more than RE‚Äù being factored into rent vs buy is false choice.

billygriffin22	693340120741597186	2016-01-30T07:49:01	NaelSanaullah But, when saying things like white people need to acknowledge privilege, tell that to destitute rural coal mining town in WV.
billygriffin22	693339602015227904	2016-01-30T07:46:57	NaelSanaullah I guess my point is we need some second level thinking here on how to help people to recognize reality w/out alienating them.

billygriffin22	688451271615840256	2016-01-16T20:02:28	austinklee conorsen However, I do not wish the government ‚Äúsilence‚Äù someone with that view. There‚Äôs a distinction.
billygriffin22	688450910939291648	2016-01-16T20:01:02	austinklee conorsen I believe that ‚ÄúA Black person is 3/5 of a person‚Äù is a ‚Äúview‚Äù that should not be held, and is invalid.
billygriffin22	688448596849524736	2016-01-16T19:51:50	austinklee conorsen As was your characterization of my position.
billygriffin22	688443422701518848	2016-01-16T19:31:17	austinklee conorsen Lol. Yes Austin, I want the government to silence everyone who doesn‚Äôt agree with me fully.
billygriffin22	688443271710818304	2016-01-16T19:30:41	conorsen Yep, I‚Äôm with you there.
billygriffin22	688442968684900352	2016-01-16T19:29:29	conorsen I agree we should attempt to limit the us vs. them construct. But false equivalence of views isn‚Äôt the way to do it IMO.
billygriffin22	688442433135194113	2016-01-16T19:27:21	conorsen austinklee I agree with that.
billygriffin22	688442281435607041	2016-01-16T19:26:45	conorsen Of course. But you can choose to not accept particular positions as valid, if in fact they are not.
billygriffin22	688442004561203200	2016-01-16T19:25:39	austinklee conorsen Offering supposed validity to extremist falsifiable positions is not a good thing.

billygriffin22	688441151511085056	2016-01-16T19:22:15	conorsen You do realize we can accept a system while acknowledging its shortfalls and not giving equal weight to absurdity, right?
billygriffin22	688440886951198721	2016-01-16T19:21:12	conorsen Are you a table? If not, my ‚Äúview‚Äù it‚Äôs absurd. But you‚Äôd seek to give it equal weight in the ‚Äúdebate‚Äù that is politics.
billygriffin22	688440626249990146	2016-01-16T19:20:10	conorsen I‚Äôm not proposing ‚Äúsilencing‚Äù voices. Just proposing that we choose not to give equal weight to differing ‚Äúviews.‚Äù
billygriffin22	688440121251643392	2016-01-16T19:18:10	conorsen If I say ‚Äúyou are not a man, but a table,‚Äù it‚Äôs not valid. Politics generates people who now believe you are in fact a table.
billygriffin22	688439745345490944	2016-01-16T19:16:40	conorsen That‚Äôs the thing I hate about politics. It assumes that differing ‚Äúviews‚Äù are equally valid, which is just absurd.

billygriffin22	688438658420969472	2016-01-16T19:12:21	conorsen Really? You can‚Äôt say ‚Äúit‚Äôs ridiculous of Cruz to lambast NY values‚Äù and simultaneously think Trump is complete buffoon?
billygriffin22	688438160154464258	2016-01-16T19:10:22	conorsen When you say ‚Äúcoalesce behind,‚Äù do you mean ‚Äúsupport‚Äù or ‚Äúthink they are best positioned to win the primary?‚Äù
