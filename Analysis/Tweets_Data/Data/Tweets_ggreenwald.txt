ggreenwald	715901848507572224	2016-04-01T14:01:16	JamesGreiff I didn't realize occupying forces were entitled to impose demands that way. You're claiming Palestinians haven't done so?
ggreenwald	715901639870320641	2016-04-01T14:00:26	If a foreign army occupied US for decades using violence, would it be "terrorism" for American citizens to fight those troops on US soil?
ggreenwald	715900463883939841	2016-04-01T13:55:46	So: fighting Israel's occupying troops = "terrorism". Boycotting Israel = illegal anti-semitism. What's legitimate to resist/end occupation?

ggreenwald	706494897885470720	2016-03-06T15:01:24	"Sanders must drop out to allow Clinton to expedite her hard turn right" seems unlikely to persuade

ggreenwald	706206787884752898	2016-03-05T19:56:33	GhostofBernie I wrote this a couple weeks ago  
ggreenwald	706206325248753664	2016-03-05T19:54:43	jennzen78 Yes, exactly.
ggreenwald	706205291508056067	2016-03-05T19:50:36	jason_pontin Well if you think that Trump having bad supporters is meaningful, you should think that about Clinton, too.
ggreenwald	706205179151048704	2016-03-05T19:50:10	jennzen78 That's awesome. Thanks for showing me that.
ggreenwald	706205025652117504	2016-03-05T19:49:33	The capacity of dogs to bring out the best in humans is amazing.... 
ggreenwald	706204524952870912	2016-03-05T19:47:34	jason_pontin Do you regard Trump's support from white supremacist as worth noting as a reflection of his campaign?
ggreenwald	706204316533657600	2016-03-05T19:46:44	JTEllermann RaniaKhalek Ttally accurate. I meant that he donated money to her because he is very familiar with (&amp; supportive of) her views
ggreenwald	706204121850847232	2016-03-05T19:45:57	jason_pontin 2 separate issues: 1) Clinton is hideous on Israel/Palestine; 2) neocons prefer her to Trump b/c she's reliable for them
ggreenwald	706203509285326850	2016-03-05T19:43:31	It's striking how little this issue been discussed in all the talk about how neocons loathe Trump &amp; prefer Clinton

ggreenwald	706147895460888576	2016-03-05T16:02:32	CarlBeijer Yes, but I think it's also defensiveness. Elites feel indicted by this anger &amp; alienation and thus want to delegitimize it.
ggreenwald	706111836790329344	2016-03-05T13:39:15	Hearing from Trump supporters explaining themselves is illuminating in a way that no anti-Trump pundit could achieve 
ggreenwald	706109919326560256	2016-03-05T13:31:38	michaelkpate Not sure that's true, but if you read article, you'll see they didn't only talk to Trump supporters but GOP voters generally
ggreenwald	706108218905387009	2016-03-05T13:24:52	According to NYT, GOP voters didn't particularly appreciate Mitt Romney's anti-Trump speech
