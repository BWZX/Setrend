SeanTrende	726042384103030785	2016-04-29T13:36:08	AdamAwalsh Yeah, but their actual influence is indirect. Pales compared to RNC/state election machines/etc.
SeanTrende	726030351085232128	2016-04-29T12:48:19	Don't get me wrong, Cruz was the absolute worst candidate for the "True Conservative" faction, for a variety of reasons, but still.
SeanTrende	726029233139621889	2016-04-29T12:43:52	So the primary basically comes down to what we saw right before IA: GOP establishment prefers Trump to Cruz.

SeanTrende	725738532598341633	2016-04-28T17:28:44	There are so many non-ideological tasks that the president does, which we have been able to take for granted. But with Trump we can't.
SeanTrende	725738290301771776	2016-04-28T17:27:46	The man is *manifestly* unfit to be president of the United States. It's a threshold question before we get to issue positions.

SeanTrende	725706392611487744	2016-04-28T15:21:01	MikeNeedham Just like the left trying to back Donna Edwards in MD or primary-ing Lieberman made sense.

SeanTrende	725704548501839872	2016-04-28T15:13:41	brainfertilizer Oh completely agree. Like I said, being pro-Cruz because he's a great alternative to Trump makes perfect sense.

SeanTrende	725694460538064897	2016-04-28T14:33:36	The amazing thing about the Trump campaign is it is the culmination of miscalculations by just about major actor in the GOP. No clean hands.

SeanTrende	710976711685492737	2016-03-18T23:50:32	Taniel Think it ends up a romp overturning last 30 years of jurisprudence either way. Politically, Rs probably better off w/o fingerprints.
SeanTrende	710976378024366086	2016-03-18T23:49:12	Taniel At the end of the day, I just don't think there will be many cases where cons are going to say "man,if we'd only confirmed Garland."
SeanTrende	710976275725348864	2016-03-18T23:48:48	Taniel I guess. I've just seen Ginsburg, Breyer and (to an extent) Sotomayor painted with similar brushes when nominated.
SeanTrende	710976077703860224	2016-03-18T23:48:00	Taniel That would be, though even that looks like a guess at best. Of course, limiting it to irrelevance is an option for minimalists.
SeanTrende	710969999167504385	2016-03-18T23:23:51	Taniel Being a court of appeals judge who doesn't want to get reversed a lot is just fundamentally different than being on SCOTUS.
SeanTrende	710969898629988352	2016-03-18T23:23:27	Taniel I mean, Breyer and to an extent Sotomayor were billed the same way, yet they're pretty reliable liberal votes.Not sure Garland=diff.
SeanTrende	710969769017655296	2016-03-18T23:22:56	Taniel Maybe? That's why I'm trying to get an answer on actual issues where we might expect that Garland would be actual centrist.
SeanTrende	710969091335577600	2016-03-18T23:20:15	Taniel Right.  So Breyer remains the pivot vote. That's why I framed it as issues where Garland would be to Breyer's right.
SeanTrende	710968737239662593	2016-03-18T23:18:50	Taniel (and that assumes that HRC can get a Brennan or Marshall through a closely divided senate, which, given '18 map, I'm not sure).
SeanTrende	710968521279344640	2016-03-18T23:17:59	Taniel . . . point is that if Garland isn't to Breyer's right, then Breyer remains vote #5. Garland doesn't swing much.
SeanTrende	710968280740208640	2016-03-18T23:17:01	Taniel I dunno. Breyer was pitched same way as Garland, and he's leading the charge there.  But regardless . . .
SeanTrende	710966981348954112	2016-03-18T23:11:52	So I guess I'm going to have to start watching Fox News.

SeanTrende	710216001695170561	2016-03-16T21:27:44	Because Kasich is running ads in Utah to keep Cruz from winning, and running from debate to help Trump save face.

SeanTrende	709843270789111808	2016-03-15T20:46:38	jneeley78 j_henry2 Kasich probably should have dropped after 8% in SC and 4% in NV.
SeanTrende	709843093844070402	2016-03-15T20:45:56	jneeley78 j_henry2 They both took from each other, but given Kasich's overall performance, more accurate to say he took from Rubio.

SeanTrende	709826412807585792	2016-03-15T19:39:39	Agree on all counts below, plus of course redistrict himself! 
SeanTrende	709774614600282112	2016-03-15T16:13:49	Here is the 2016 election in a nutshell 
SeanTrende	709822451044241408	2016-03-15T19:23:54	Heckuva job media.
SeanTrende	709822340121686016	2016-03-15T19:23:28	Kasich, one of the last three GOPers, got less free media than Bush, Rubio, Christie, Carson, Fiorina, and Paul. 
SeanTrende	709821831046418432	2016-03-15T19:21:27	Just to put this in perspective, of the 16 candidates listed, Trump received 46 percent of the free media. 
SeanTrende	709819790395904004	2016-03-15T19:13:20	AdamAwalsh Also, whether Kasich drops out tonight or not.
SeanTrende	709819747035176969	2016-03-15T19:13:10	AdamAwalsh As of today though, I have Trump at maybe 50-50 to be the nominee. Just depends how MO/IL shake out @ CD level. Then we'll know.
SeanTrende	709819486992474113	2016-03-15T19:12:08	AdamAwalsh Oh look, if Trump is the nominee, it's probably a nine or a ten.  The Senate is gone and the House is 50-50.
SeanTrende	709815832961011712	2016-03-15T18:57:36	AdamAwalsh Too many unknowns at this point, and depends what your definition of screwed is. Probably 6-7.
SeanTrende	709812753788215298	2016-03-15T18:45:22	Unreal.

SeanTrende	709774990292467717	2016-03-15T16:15:19	If Cruz pulls off an upset in MO &amp; comes close in IL, odds of contested convention would rise dramatically. OH less of an indicator.
SeanTrende	709774088903008256	2016-03-15T16:11:44	If Trump wins ALL 26 IL/MO CDs &amp; 121 delegates, he's probably unstoppable even w/ OH loss. If Cruz wins at least a third, good sign for him.

SeanTrende	709733702717153280	2016-03-15T13:31:15	Read SeanTrende on whether winning a plurality of convention delegates should give Trump the GOP nomination 
SeanTrende	709741538901958657	2016-03-15T14:02:23	Fyodor32768 we give it to the person with the most delegates.  That's fine, but Republicans chose a different route 160 years ago.
SeanTrende	709741409604124672	2016-03-15T14:01:53	Fyodor32768 So the question is "how do you deal with a situation where no one has true democratic legitimacy." You can choose to say, well,
SeanTrende	709741238539456514	2016-03-15T14:01:12	Fyodor32768 This is true in congressional races as well: Don't *need* to give it to folk with pluralities.
SeanTrende	709741110982213633	2016-03-15T14:00:41	Fyodor32768 As for the broader issue, key=there is no democratic legitimacy with a plurality (esp. when he gets ~33% of actual votes).
SeanTrende	709740899077644288	2016-03-15T13:59:51	Fyodor32768 Well, a majority of the primary electorate finds Trump unacceptable, so that's not really a problem.

SeanTrende	709084144798724096	2016-03-13T18:30:08	dsager45 allahpundit HotlineJosh Trump supporters will convince themselves of that.The other 70% will just be relieved he can't be POTUS.
SeanTrende	709080954137145345	2016-03-13T18:17:28	NASCARJamesR HotlineJosh Looking at DC and NoVa suburbs, I think it's very unlikely he wins. Trump do well in Cumberland and the E. Shore.
SeanTrende	709080764189638658	2016-03-13T18:16:42	dsager45 allahpundit HotlineJosh And Cruz will win on the 1st ballot.  Unless Trump is very close to 1,237.
SeanTrende	709080681163390978	2016-03-13T18:16:23	dsager45 allahpundit HotlineJosh But what's likely to happen is Kasich/Rubio will endorse Cruz, b/c Cruz is their voters' 2d/3d choice.
SeanTrende	709080530126577664	2016-03-13T18:15:47	dsager45 allahpundit HotlineJosh It's straightforward: He needs 1,237. At, say, 1,150, he can probably get enough undeclared to win.
SeanTrende	709077704692404224	2016-03-13T18:04:33	dsager45 allahpundit HotlineJosh Point is,for 150 years,you've needed a majority of the delegates to be the nominee. He's not special.
SeanTrende	709077499087609858	2016-03-13T18:03:44	dsager45 allahpundit HotlineJosh it will be exceptionally easy, since a majority of them will be relieved.

SeanTrende	697501394371268608	2016-02-10T19:24:26	yeselson jbview I'd just say to spend some time playing with the delegate calculator. It's not precise, but is a decent heuristic.
SeanTrende	697501229002420224	2016-02-10T19:23:46	yeselson jbview I think if they can they will. If Rubio is, say, fifth in SC, he might be gone. If Kasich goes nowhere 3/1, he might drop.
SeanTrende	697501048961961985	2016-02-10T19:23:03	yeselson jbview I think that's probably right. But the trick is, I don't think the establishment allows a Trump/Cruz race. Could be wrong.

SeanTrende	697499738732630018	2016-02-10T19:17:51	jbview yeselson that, to me, is the fundamental dynamic here.  Two candidates with real ceilings and floors. And a host of capable guys...
SeanTrende	697499622231666688	2016-02-10T19:17:23	jbview yeselson Agree on two, one seems less likely. Problem is, establishment won't give up.
SeanTrende	697498690999570433	2016-02-10T19:13:41	One of mine said: "when an argument begins 'surely', you're likely to have met its weak spot." 
SeanTrende	697499034378964995	2016-02-10T19:15:03	yeselson jbview And I think Trump and Cruz have pretty clearly punched tickets through then.

SeanTrende	697498419259121665	2016-02-10T19:12:36	yeselson jbview More problem with the "winnowing" theory.  Yes it will occur, but very possibly slowly for orderly resolution.
SeanTrende	697498137208999936	2016-02-10T19:11:29	A law professor of mine was fond of saying that "when an argument boils down to 'it cannot be' that means it probably is."

SeanTrende	697497483409289217	2016-02-10T19:08:53	yeselson jbview Problem is that 1/3 of the delegates are awarded by then, and no one is likely to have a substantial lead.
SeanTrende	697497391210045440	2016-02-10T19:08:31	yeselson jbview I'd bet a decent sum of money that this will be at least a 3-person field 3/1. Probably 4. Consistent w your statement 1/2
SeanTrende	697495123937120256	2016-02-10T18:59:31	Invite you to revisit the RCP delegate calculator. Without more dropouts, hard to amass big del. leads before 3/15. 
SeanTrende	697494697758105600	2016-02-10T18:57:49	LandJohnston SteveKornacki Obama was a poor fit for blue collars, esp. in a D primary vs a Clinton, for a wide variety of reasons. 2/2

SeanTrende	694197515294527488	2016-02-01T16:35:59	In other words, a poll average will give you your *best* answer, but for a caucus, you should include a large mental error margin.

SeanTrende	694197220011278337	2016-02-01T16:34:49	Ultimately it is probably Trump by four or five, then Cruz, then Rubio another five or six behind. BUT this is Iowa polling of caucuses...
SeanTrende	694197067414110210	2016-02-01T16:34:13	If pollsters were reporting within-sample surges, I'd be more inclined to see it as an upset brewing.  But it is still possible.
SeanTrende	694196908563259392	2016-02-01T16:33:35	FWIW, I think Rubio will be a solid third, because I suspect the uptick is mostly, but not entirely, pollster screen effects.

SeanTrende	694189234043883520	2016-02-01T16:03:05	GeoffBudden The trendline is pretty pronounced.  Just weird that pollsters aren't seeing it within samples.
SeanTrende	694189103248728064	2016-02-01T16:02:34	yesper8231 There's evidence (see the overall trendline). Just weird that it doesn't appear *within* samples.
