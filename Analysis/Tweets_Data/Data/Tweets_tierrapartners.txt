tierrapartners	721753045424451584	2016-04-17T17:31:50	mdrayton Correct. She's accused of misuse of public funds to balance the budget. Far worse. Ask any PBR shareholder.
tierrapartners	721752794638729216	2016-04-17T17:30:50	mdrayton Oh please. The country has been "voting" since last year. Are you naïve enough to think the protests didn't bring this to a head?
