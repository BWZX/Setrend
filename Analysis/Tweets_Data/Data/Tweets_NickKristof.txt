NickKristof	720797526224408576	2016-04-15T02:14:56	Libya is a mess following intervention (8000+ now dead) and Syria is a worse mess without intervention (350,000 dead). Lessons are complex.
NickKristof	720795546789769221	2016-04-15T02:07:04	Alas, debates reward slogans and over-simplification. Governing is messy &amp; complex, with tradeoffs--and more problems than solutions.
NickKristof	720794798970576897	2016-04-15T02:04:06	Sanders says Clinton is incrementalist and adds "that's not enough." Problem for Sanders is that revolution easier to advocate than achieve

NickKristof	720793240228732928	2016-04-15T01:57:54	To me, Sanders is most effective when he speaks rather than shouts, when he is gracious rather than finger-wagging.
NickKristof	720792145238618112	2016-04-15T01:53:33	The number of Americans in jails rose sixfold after 1970; mass incarceration also contributed to the breakdown of the American family.
NickKristof	720791000202027009	2016-04-15T01:49:00	It's a little odd that Clinton is much more defensive on the 1994 crime bill than Sanders is, given that he's the one who voted for it.

NickKristof	720788317781041152	2016-04-15T01:38:21	Bernie Sanders has not been good on guns (because he comes from Vermont). He voted against Brady Bill five times

NickKristof	720786985061847040	2016-04-15T01:33:03	Clinton explains that she wants a $12 minimum wage but also wants a $15 one. If you don't understand that, you're not alone.
NickKristof	720786593578106880	2016-04-15T01:31:30	Clinton now says that she supports raising the minimum wage to $15. That position reflects months of pressure from Sanders.
NickKristof	720784764895162368	2016-04-15T01:24:14	Bernie Sanders hasn't released his taxes yet, which puzzles me, but he says he will finally release 2014 taxes tomorrow. Good to hear.

NickKristof	720783211173933056	2016-04-15T01:18:03	Sanders says he would break up big banks, but in his Daily News interview he didn't seem to have any clue how he would do it.
NickKristof	720781906938359809	2016-04-15T01:12:52	"No bank is too big too fail, no executive is too powerful to jail." --Clinton. Nice slogan, but not accurate account of the situation.
NickKristof	720781031230599168	2016-04-15T01:09:23	Truth is that Clinton and Sanders are similar in their politics, but tonight they're bludgeoning each other as if...they were Republicans!
NickKristof	720780687410872321	2016-04-15T01:08:01	Sanders early in the campaign was gracious to Clinton; sad to see him now refusing to say that she has judgment to be president.

NickKristof	707919279811911680	2016-03-10T13:21:23	If you missed the DemDebate last night, I've saved you time: 
NickKristof	707901769016340480	2016-03-10T12:11:48	We don't allow websites to sell heroin. So why allow a website be used to peddle kids for sex? My column:

NickKristof	707778006199226368	2016-03-10T04:00:01	Yes, it's important for moderators to push back when candidates inevitably answer a question they weren't asked! 
NickKristof	707777623489912832	2016-03-10T03:58:29	Good debate tonight. In general, the Democratic debates have had softer questions than GOP ones, but today there were good, tough questions.
NickKristof	707776975604162561	2016-03-10T03:55:55	KyleEdgerton No, two post offices, one veterans bill.
NickKristof	707775472818585600	2016-03-10T03:49:57	AbeLolisted No. Carried interest is labor income, for work done. But it's taxed as if it were investment income. That's why it's a loophole
NickKristof	707774824286912513	2016-03-10T03:47:22	chrsdcook Yes, indeed. good for him for pushing it.
NickKristof	707773726104887296	2016-03-10T03:43:00	Sanders has been better with amendments than with bills he introduced. But don't overstate his legislative impact. 
NickKristof	707771896809521153	2016-03-10T03:35:44	Europe has moved toward financial transactions taxes as well; the idea is to implement them  together. 
NickKristof	707771674616320000	2016-03-10T03:34:51	It's fair for Sanders to cite his good bills--and to note that only 3 of his bills ever became law (and 2 renamed post offices).
NickKristof	707771096150450176	2016-03-10T03:32:33	Sugalean Yes, that's what prompted my tweet.
NickKristof	707770294082146305	2016-03-10T03:29:22	Too much talk about "standing up to Wall Street"; not enough about specifics, eg a financial transactions tax or carried interest loophole.
NickKristof	707769966326636544	2016-03-10T03:28:04	I agree with Sanders on a financial transactions tax. It was proposed by James Tobin, Nobel laureate, and raises billions for good causes.
NickKristof	707768777509834753	2016-03-10T03:23:20	Late to the DemDebate? Catch up with NickKristof's collected tweets: 
NickKristof	707768878697463808	2016-03-10T03:23:45	I dream of toddlers voting, and politicians toddlerpandering. Then we'd see public investments in children! 
NickKristof	707768362638712832	2016-03-10T03:21:42	For example, if we don't help 535,000 US kids avoid lead poisoning, then not much use paying for their college tuition. Invest early!
NickKristof	707767887365337088	2016-03-10T03:19:48	We should be talking about pre-k, which would have more impact than college spending. Highest return public investments are in 0-5 space.
NickKristof	707764895765434369	2016-03-10T03:07:55	Clinton is right that tragedies at embassies abroad have happened with sad regularity--but haven't been politicized like Benghazi was.
NickKristof	707764559751344129	2016-03-10T03:06:35	Did Clinton lie to Benghazi families? We don't know; accounts differ. Here's PolitiFact's conclusion 
NickKristof	707763453818183680	2016-03-10T03:02:11	Any time Wall Street comes up in a DemDebate, Sanders gains. Any time gun policy comes up, Clinton gains.
NickKristof	707762798529519616	2016-03-10T02:59:35	What baffles me is why Clinton gave these paid speeches knowing that she was going to run for president. Wasn't corrupt, but it was stupid.
NickKristof	707762541984948224	2016-03-10T02:58:34	Agree.  Times 10.  
NickKristof	707761666977615872	2016-03-10T02:55:05	"I am not a natural politician...like my husband or Pres Obama" --Clinton, explaining some of trust gap.
NickKristof	707761313720696832	2016-03-10T02:53:41	The questions in this DemDebate illuminate a different America--one on margins, fearing deportation--than the ones asked in the GOP debate
NickKristof	707759858464985088	2016-03-10T02:47:54	Asked the difference between her  wall and Trump's, Clinton basically says that hers will be lower and uglier--and Mexico won't pay for it.

NickKristof	707757990955327489	2016-03-10T02:40:29	The backdrop for this DemDebate discussion of immigration is Obama's "shameful roundup" of Central Amer refugees 
NickKristof	707752877532569600	2016-03-10T02:20:10	How immensely satisfying must it be for Trump, who started out mostly to get attention, that both parties' debates are now about him.
NickKristof	707752282625056768	2016-03-10T02:17:48	Here's a good fact-check on the Clinton email issue:  Bottom line is it's more problematic than she acknowledges.
NickKristof	707751924859326464	2016-03-10T02:16:22	I think critics overdo the email issue, but it's true that it's a much bigger issue than Clinton acknowledges. It was really bad judgment.
NickKristof	707751506511003649	2016-03-10T02:14:43	"I made a mistake" --Clinton talking about her email decisions
NickKristof	707751304555274240	2016-03-10T02:13:55	Sad to see the DemDebate begin with horse race questions.  We in the media overdo horse race questions, and underdo policy. So policy, pls!

NickKristof	706678395619446784	2016-03-07T03:10:33	My take on DemDebate: Sanders more likable, less calculating, and a mensch; Clinton better informed, more pragmatic and more electable.
NickKristof	706676348455096320	2016-03-07T03:02:25	Listening to tonight's DemDebate and the audience, it appears the Democrats and Republicans are competing to lead different countries.

NickKristof	706670229380866048	2016-03-07T02:38:06	Yes, the single best investment we could make to fight causes of poverty, not symptoms, would be in the 0-5 space. 
NickKristof	706669365215797249	2016-03-07T02:34:40	As long as we're talking about education policy, it's critical to talk about 0-5 interventions for at-risk kids. Highest-return investment.
NickKristof	706668987879440384	2016-03-07T02:33:10	It's true that teacher unions have protected incompetent teachers. Also true that states with strong unions have better student outcomes.
NickKristof	706668398655217667	2016-03-07T02:30:50	For 11-year-olds in US schools, 30% of SES educational inequality occurs because of unequal schools.
NickKristof	706667922534625280	2016-03-07T02:28:56	Good to have DemDebate on school system. Schools should reduce inequality, but in the US educational inequality expands it.

NickKristof	706662986316967936	2016-03-07T02:09:19	Some in GOP (eg Texas) led the push away from mass incarceration--not for justice reasons but because it's costly. 
NickKristof	706662287864631296	2016-03-07T02:06:33	Incarceration rates in the US quintupled since 1970 (altho 1994 crime bill only a modest reason for that), devastating low-income families.
NickKristof	706661906543673344	2016-03-07T02:05:02	Mass incarceration was 1 of America's great mistakes, destroying families. Neither Clinton nor Sanders seems to me sufficiently regretful.
NickKristof	706660761276383232	2016-03-07T02:00:29	Sanders is backing special immunity for gun manufacturers that does not exist for other manufacturers. 
NickKristof	706660003575365632	2016-03-07T01:57:28	Sanders says he's in favor of the law excusing gun manufacturers from liability. That's a mistake: No special protections for gun makers.
NickKristof	706659572161912834	2016-03-07T01:55:45	California will have a referendum this year on restricting access to ammunition. That'll be an important experiment and may help.
NickKristof	706659287284772864	2016-03-07T01:54:37	Sanders notes that there's no magic solution to gun deaths. True. But we could plausibly cut gun deaths by 1/3--saving 11,000 lives a year.

NickKristof	706651719829168128	2016-03-07T01:24:33	Read NickKristof's, "America is Flint."     I asked BernieSanders about it yesterday:  
NickKristof	706651645053181952	2016-03-07T01:24:15	Great to see a robust discussion of lead poisoning in DemDebate. Compare the GOP debate, where it came up only briefly.
NickKristof	706651005207900160	2016-03-07T01:21:43	DemDebate: We should reduce not just lead poisoning but also contamination by endocrine disrupting chemicals, which have similar effects
NickKristof	706650426427502592	2016-03-07T01:19:25	The lead industry behaved disgracefully: It systematically blocked safety regulations for decades. Like tobacco &amp; chemical industries.
NickKristof	706649803745337345	2016-03-07T01:16:56	Yes! Clinton notes correctly that the bigger nat'l problem is lead paint and soil. But funds for lead poisoning were cut in late 2000's.
NickKristof	706649362517114880	2016-03-07T01:15:11	Also worth noting that CDC only counts lead levels as elevated if above 5 micrograms, but brain damage occurs at even lower levels.
NickKristof	706649126793060352	2016-03-07T01:14:15	Clinton &amp; Sanders in DemDebate both note that lead poisoning is a national issue. Details of national crisis here: 
NickKristof	706648608049860609	2016-03-07T01:12:11	Good to see DemDebate focusing on lead poisoning, but we have to recognize this is not 1 city's crisis, but a national crisis.
NickKristof	706648333234925568	2016-03-07T01:11:06	Many places, esp poverty areas, have even higher levels of lead poisoning than Flint does (from old paint and soil, not water).
NickKristof	706647854417317892	2016-03-07T01:09:12	In the DemDebate, let's remember that lead poisoning goes far, far beyond Flint. Some 535,000 US children suffer lead poisoning, CDC says.

NickKristof	705734836464574464	2016-03-04T12:41:11	aharbo MiaFarrow Point taken. Lead poisoning causes individual heartbreak and social dysfunction. Huge individual and social costs.

NickKristof	705605459277963264	2016-03-04T04:07:05	And if you want my take on the prospect of President Trump, here is my column today on just that: 
NickKristof	705605017051516928	2016-03-04T04:05:20	The other candidates, and the Fox questioners, took plenty of whacks at Trump. I thought they drew a bit of Trump blood, but only a bit.
NickKristof	705604688012566528	2016-03-04T04:04:01	After getting beyond genitalia, this debate had substance. I thought Kasich helped himself the most by seeming the grown-up in the room.
NickKristof	705603948498034688	2016-03-04T04:01:05	Donald Trump defends his hands: 
NickKristof	705603297336561664	2016-03-04T03:58:30	Rubio, Cruz and Kasich all commit, reluctantly, to support Trump if he becomes the GOP nominee. They back away from NeverTrump.
NickKristof	705584847176245248	2016-03-04T02:45:11	Trump, just like that, softens his immigration policy - "I'm changing it": a taster of how he'll pivot to the centre in the general election
NickKristof	705596770764627968	2016-03-04T03:32:34	Who’s gained most Twitter followers since GOPDebate started:  Kasich: +3,953 Cruz: +1,772 Rubio: +1,585  Trump: +7,191
NickKristof	705601405680271360	2016-03-04T03:50:59	History is North Korea made 1st nuclear weapon under 1st Pres Bush; 0 under Clinton, about six under George W. Bush. I rest my case.
NickKristof	705600967740420096	2016-03-04T03:49:14	It's ridiculous for Cruz to blame the Clinton administration for North Korean nuclear weapons. North Korea produced 0 weapons under Clinton
NickKristof	705600223914004481	2016-03-04T03:46:17	A good guy with a gun 
NickKristof	705599797529583616	2016-03-04T03:44:35	Re threats, and guns, remember that more people have died since 1970 in the US from guns than in all wars in US history.
NickKristof	705599050423410689	2016-03-04T03:41:37	Climate change is a far greater threat than ISIS. Even in Syria, one underlying reason for the war may be drought. 
NickKristof	705598562973978627	2016-03-04T03:39:41	"Donald has a tenuous relationship with the truth." --Ted Cruz, of whom the same could be said.
NickKristof	705598198161739776	2016-03-04T03:38:14	Our world may be more at risk from climate change than from anything else--and it doesn't even come up in the debate.
NickKristof	705596069565046784	2016-03-04T03:29:46	Marco Rubio asked about Flint lead crisis. But as NickKristof notes, lead poisoning is a huge problem nationwide 
NickKristof	705595853910777856	2016-03-04T03:28:55	Compare the Lincoln-Douglas debates with the Trump-Rubio debates. And weep. 
NickKristof	705595407171252228	2016-03-04T03:27:09	Those 535,000 kids with lead poisoning suffer permanent brain damage and less self-control, including higher risk of crime. Huge problem.
NickKristof	705595169475788800	2016-03-04T03:26:12	What's more, the problem isn't just Flint: 535,000 American children suffer lead poisoning (mostly from paint), according to the CDC.
NickKristof	705594709985591296	2016-03-04T03:24:22	Oh, no! Rubio is making apologies for Michigan's handling of lead poisoning in Flint. It was a disgrace!
NickKristof	705594204353789952	2016-03-04T03:22:22	The longer this goes, the higher Kasich climbs and the lower Rubio sinks with my focus group. 📈 📉  GOPDebate

NickKristof	705593340897705984	2016-03-04T03:18:56	Ted Cruz is very smart, and a very effective debater, and he has helped himself tonight. But I don't think he'd be effective in November.
NickKristof	705592325863563265	2016-03-04T03:14:54	Trump is right: Of the candidates who ran for President, Rubio has the worst Senate voting record. GOPDebate 
NickKristof	705592239867764740	2016-03-04T03:14:33	Trump's approach, when cornered, is to erupt in insults like a geyser. It's entertaining and does divert attention--but has zero content.
NickKristof	705591538324283393	2016-03-04T03:11:46	WashPost fact-checked Trump U and Kelly is right, Trump wrong: Its last rating from Better Business Bureau was a D- 
NickKristof	705591069954678785	2016-03-04T03:09:54	Good to see Megyn Kelly trying to fact-check and truth squad the candidates, rather than just let them huff and puff and lie.
NickKristof	705590183371120640	2016-03-04T03:06:23	Trump is right that leaders need flexibility, including the right to change their minds. But critics are also right that he has no core.
NickKristof	705589787210727424	2016-03-04T03:04:49	It's odd that Trump has a reputation as a straight shooter when Politifact attributes to him the "lie of the year" 
NickKristof	705587990148550656	2016-03-04T02:57:40	Poor RichardHaass, a brilliant, sensible guy, has just suffered the most devastating blow to his credibility from Trump. Praise!
NickKristof	705587591698063360	2016-03-04T02:56:05	Trump said wives of 9/11 hijackers left US a few days before the attacks. He's wrong: They were not married. (he's confused w/ other Saudis)
NickKristof	705586553930825728	2016-03-04T02:51:58	Trump is defending the idea that the US should torture and commit crimes against humanity: "I've always been a leader."
NickKristof	705585874969477121	2016-03-04T02:49:16	If they do actually come to blows on stage, do their Secret Service details fight too? GOPDebate
NickKristof	705585530675830784	2016-03-04T02:47:54	Same reason Hillary Clinton doesn't want to release her off-the-record conversations at Goldman Sachs.
NickKristof	705585357987975168	2016-03-04T02:47:13	In fairness, I see why a candidate wouldn't want to release off-the-record conversations. Many people say things OTR that they wouldn't on.
NickKristof	705584626773987328	2016-03-04T02:44:18	One of the winners this year has been megynkelly. She asks good, tough questions. I wish she had the chance to grill Democrats, too.
NickKristof	705583134579023874	2016-03-04T02:38:23	Trump says he will not ask for release of off-the-record NYT comments. What he actually said that day was... Oh, oops, I'm out of space.
NickKristof	705582367432282112	2016-03-04T02:35:20	Trump is asked about his meeting with us at the NY Times, if he will ask to make it on the record, and he filibusters.
NickKristof	705581229748445186	2016-03-04T02:30:48	Good answer by JohnKasich: He does better in smaller field, and when his maturity contrasts with childish squabbling among the others.
NickKristof	705580449750511616	2016-03-04T02:27:42	Trump says we don't negotiate drug prices. And who has consistently prevented Medicare from doing so? A Republican Congress! GOPDebate
NickKristof	705580611096985601	2016-03-04T02:28:21	Trump says his strong point is that he gets along with everybody--which is odd since he has triggered a civil war within his own party.
NickKristof	705579538072379394	2016-03-04T02:24:05	Credit to Fox News: It asks tough questions of GOP candidates, tougher questions than Democratic candidates were asked in their debates.
NickKristof	705578934075834368	2016-03-04T02:21:41	I would call this debate a kindergarten squabble. But that would defame kindergartners.
NickKristof	705577847096737792	2016-03-04T02:17:22	People used to say that women were too hormonal to be president. Looking at this GOPDebate, I think men may be too hormonal to hold office.
NickKristof	705576988904431616	2016-03-04T02:13:57	Trump says, "I beat Hillary Clinton in many polls." Not really.  GOPDebate
NickKristof	705576844045762560	2016-03-04T02:13:23	I wonder how PolitiFact will fact-check a candidates' genital size. And I can't believe that I'm tweeting this in a Presidential debate!
NickKristof	705576333892587521	2016-03-04T02:11:21	If the authors of the Federalist Papers heard this discussion, they would drop independence and back George III. 
NickKristof	705576152140750849	2016-03-04T02:10:38	I believe in metrics in GOPDebate. But not that kind. Trump asserts his manhood, but at least he didn't lower his pants to make his point.

NickKristof	697998230903242753	2016-02-12T04:18:41	On my timeline, both Clinton and Sanders fans agree that the debate was a knockout. They just disagree about who won.
NickKristof	697992695671844864	2016-02-12T03:56:41	Decent debate. Sanders has pulled Clinton to the left. Both did fine, but neither is an obvious winner to me. Thoughts?
NickKristof	697991275920945156	2016-02-12T03:51:02	I think the candidates should have faced tougher questions. Fox  raked Republican candidates over the coals; Dems should endure the same.

NickKristof	695466516515581952	2016-02-05T04:38:33	Who do you think won tonight's Democratic debate?
NickKristof	695462506760904704	2016-02-05T04:22:37	Here's my take on the DemDebate, in the form of curated tweets, holding the candidates' feet to the fire 
NickKristof	695458365347098624	2016-02-05T04:06:09	Sanders is right: US is the only country with no mandated paid leave. About time this changed. DemDebate 
NickKristof	695458729391747072	2016-02-05T04:07:36	So who won tonight's Democratic debate? I'd say the voters. It was a strong debate, illuminating but not venomous.
NickKristof	695457931794505729	2016-02-05T04:04:26	Bernie Sanders always comes across as a very decent guy. It's nice to see respect for opponents, acknowledgment of shared values.
NickKristof	695456682273566722	2016-02-05T03:59:28	Clinton says donors didn't affect her positions. Her stance on a bankruptcy law opposed by banks may be an exception 
NickKristof	695455186173693952	2016-02-05T03:53:31	Yes! Lead poisoning is a national tragedy. Flint should galvanize us to address this everywhere, not just in Flint. 
NickKristof	695454678658740224	2016-02-05T03:51:30	hughhewitt Everybody assumes that. But I suspect that there will be proof, not just speculation.
NickKristof	695453908303482880	2016-02-05T03:48:27	Here's a piece I did on lead poisoning in inner-city Baltimore, where more kids are lead-poisoned than in Flint 
NickKristof	695453373114511360	2016-02-05T03:46:19	Good comments on Flint. But lead poisoning is a national crisis, not just a Flint crisis, affecting 535,000 US children.
NickKristof	695452297250414592	2016-02-05T03:42:03	I bet Clinton is thinking of the general election when she backs the death penalty: three-fifths of Americans support it.
NickKristof	695450350967369728	2016-02-05T03:34:19	Respect for Sanders -- with media ginning for blood on floor,Sanders goes high road.
NickKristof	695451015609364480	2016-02-05T03:36:57	Next shoe to drop on emails, I'm guessing, will be the revelation that Chinese &amp; Russians were snooping on Clinton's server.
NickKristof	695450390989533185	2016-02-05T03:34:28	Sanders doesn't have the killer instinct--refusing to attack Clinton on emails--which is really very refreshing.
NickKristof	695449984502755328	2016-02-05T03:32:51	Clinton is too glib on email issue. Big problem is the time she told an aide to send material by non-secure means 
NickKristof	695449498751995904	2016-02-05T03:30:55	One problem for Sanders on electability: 50 percent say they will never support a socialist. That's quite an obstacle in November.
NickKristof	695448943442993152	2016-02-05T03:28:43	Anyone who remembers McGovern in 1972 has trouble with Sanders' electability. It's true that he has won hearts in Vermont. But...
NickKristof	695447781406871552	2016-02-05T03:24:06	A Sanders vulnerability: He didn't accomplish much in 25 years in Congress: 3 laws, of which 2 renamed post offices 
NickKristof	695447090407735299	2016-02-05T03:21:21	I might have nicer things to say about North Korea if it would give me another visa. Just in case you're reading this, Kim Jong Un!
NickKristof	695446374368677888	2016-02-05T03:18:31	supersetgreg North Korea has about a dozen nuclear weapons. But possibly no means to deliver them via warhead.
NickKristof	695445706090242052	2016-02-05T03:15:51	Tweeps are making fun of Sanders for saying North Korea is greatest threat. But he has a point: Kim Jong Un has nukes and is unpredictable.
NickKristof	695444119561195520	2016-02-05T03:09:33	A bit silly to be debating whether we should normalize relations with Iran, when Iran isn't willing to normalize relations with us.
NickKristof	695443490935713794	2016-02-05T03:07:03	Sanders is pretty incoherent on foreign policy. But to his credit he was right on what counted most, the Iraq war, and Clinton was wrong.
NickKristof	695442836318253056	2016-02-05T03:04:27	HRC struggles with the speech/Wall Street Qs. Sanders still struggling with anything involving foreign policy
NickKristof	695441382647820288	2016-02-05T02:58:40	Having lived in a Communist country, I assure you: The only thing worse than a country with  bankers is one without them.
NickKristof	695439306148548608	2016-02-05T02:50:25	Yes, Wall Street has gotten away with too much. But underwriting stocks and bonds, corporate lending--that is essential business, not fraud.
NickKristof	695439040632369152	2016-02-05T02:49:22	Wow! Sanders goes way too far when he says that the business model of Wall Street is fraud. Banking is crucial for our economy. DemDebate
NickKristof	695437654444240898	2016-02-05T02:43:52	BonzoBeckett To avoid conflicts, NY Times staff don't speak to corporations or industry groups. Only to universities &amp; nonprofits.
NickKristof	695437384004083712	2016-02-05T02:42:47	Hillary Clinton is now for ending the carried interest loophole for hedge funds &amp; private equity.  But she didn't try when she was senator.
NickKristof	695436620334432256	2016-02-05T02:39:45	Er, when an industry pays a lot of money to a candidate, it's an investment. And it's seeking a return on that investment.
NickKristof	695434469751148546	2016-02-05T02:31:12	Of course it was a mistake for Clinton to take $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in one year. Of course.
NickKristof	695434119908454400	2016-02-05T02:29:49	Sanders is right that Wall St donations helped win Clinton admin financial liberalization. It wasn't bribes, but it bought access.
NickKristof	695433114726715392	2016-02-05T02:25:49	But Clinton can't pounce on Sanders' lack of accomplishments because when she was in the Senate she didn't get much passed either.
NickKristof	695432914855538688	2016-02-05T02:25:02	A Sanders vulnerability: He didn't accomplish much in 25 years in Congress: 3 bills, of which 2 renamed post offices 
NickKristof	695431308936245250	2016-02-05T02:18:39	This DemDebate about labels--"I'm more progressive than you!"--is silly. It's jostling over ideological purity. Let's talk about policies.
NickKristof	695430650002714626	2016-02-05T02:16:02	As Clinton &amp; Sanders feud over who is more progressive, worth remembering that only 31 percent of Americans identify as liberal.
NickKristof	695428980216717312	2016-02-05T02:09:23	Good for Sanders for acknowledging that the backdrop is that he and Clinton agree on a great deal. DemDebate
NickKristof	695428691908698118	2016-02-05T02:08:15	Clinton also smacks Sanders by adding: "I'm not making promises that I cannot keep." She says his numbers don't add up.
NickKristof	695428299799986176	2016-02-05T02:06:41	Hillary Clinton opens with a statement that strikes me as a bit more populist than usual--presumably Sanders' influence. DemDebate
NickKristof	695411699067662336	2016-02-05T01:00:43	I admire Bernie Sanders in many ways. But I have 2 key questions for him. My column

NickKristof	694377339866710016	2016-02-02T04:30:33	If GOP picks Cruz or Trump, it's probably headed for defeat Nov 8; if it picks Rubio, anything could happen. He gives Democrats nightmares.

NickKristof	692932576336543744	2016-01-29T04:49:34	ArmsControlWonk Yes, I agree. I'd say that we then saw some precision bombing, but most was not--but still far from carpet bombing.

NickKristof	692920811141910528	2016-01-29T04:02:49	Rubio also wrapped himself in the Bible, which may help in Iowa, and is outstanding at sounding sincere even if he isn't. Great skill.
NickKristof	692920521760051200	2016-01-29T04:01:40	I'm not sure who won the debate, but perhaps Trump, who spared himself attacks by his absence--as his rivals slashed each other.

NickKristof	692904289598115840	2016-01-29T02:57:10	No federal funding goes for abortions. But support for family planning prevents 345,000 abortions annually! 
NickKristof	692903548049330177	2016-01-29T02:54:14	Hey, candidates, every $1 invested in public family planning saves $7.09 in Medicaid and other govt spending 
NickKristof	692903090652090369	2016-01-29T02:52:24	Attn: Chris Christie. One Planned Parenthood IUD costs $500. One Medicaid childbirth costs $14,000. You're not saving government money.
NickKristof	692902793347256321	2016-01-29T02:51:14	Chris Christie says he'll save money by cutting Planned Parenthood. But contraception for low-income families saves govt money 7 times over.
NickKristof	692901178368069633	2016-01-29T02:44:49	Okay, that's a fair point.

NickKristof	692899952301707264	2016-01-29T02:39:56	I think Ben Carson is a nice guy. But president? To me, he recalls Churchill's description of Atlee: "A sheep in sheep's clothing."
NickKristof	692898798457106432	2016-01-29T02:35:21	If a president actually asked USAF to carpet bomb, the air campaign commander wouldn't authorize it, nor would Airmen fly the mission.

NickKristof	692897733192126464	2016-01-29T02:31:07	Cruz is an excellent debater, but he doesn't have a back-up career option in stand-up comedy. When he jokes, he's more scary than funny.
NickKristof	692895820958474240	2016-01-29T02:23:31	The GOP has some first-rate international security experts, like Bob Gates and Brent Scowcroft, but GOP candidates never cite them.
NickKristof	692895169914376192	2016-01-29T02:20:56	Attn: Ted Cruz! Carpet bombing is when you bomb hospitals, schools, civilian neighborhoods, everything that moves. It's a war crime.
NickKristof	692894891026743296	2016-01-29T02:19:50	Ted Cruz utterly misstates what carpet bombing is, says it's what happens in 1st Gulf War. Nope, that was precision bombing, the opposite.
NickKristof	692894671735894020	2016-01-29T02:18:57	Fox asks Ted Cruz if he really will fight ISIS with carpet bombing, i.e. with violation of international humanitarian law. Cruz says yes.

NickKristof	692891354985172994	2016-01-29T02:05:46	Fox News begins GOPDebate with what seems to me an inappropriate question, inviting Cruz to whack Trump for his absence. Substance, please.

NickKristof	688933879504326656	2016-01-18T04:00:11	Hillary Clinton excels when the debate is about wonky policy issues, or governing. But tonight was about vision, and that's Sanders' turf.
NickKristof	688933598502727680	2016-01-18T03:59:04	My overall sense: Clinton stronger on foreign policy, but on domestic issues, Sanders stronger. She showed nuance; he showed passion.

NickKristof	688925897068560384	2016-01-18T03:28:28	In contrast, Clinton gives an excellent answer on Syria. And she had a plausible strategy on Syria before Obama vetoed it.
NickKristof	688925538266804227	2016-01-18T03:27:02	Sanders may have good instincts on foreign affairs, as in opposing Iraq war. But he just doesn't know international affairs.

NickKristof	688924499476086784	2016-01-18T03:22:54	Sanders on Syria is not very knowledgeable or coherent. How do we get Sunni troops to take on IS when they care mostly about Assad?
NickKristof	688923994381258752	2016-01-18T03:20:54	Reminds me of the time in 2003 a copyeditor asked another: "So what's the style for this country? I've seen it both ways. Iran. And Iraq.
NickKristof	688923506118148096	2016-01-18T03:18:58	One sign of Clinton's greater knowledge of foreign affairs: She pronounces "Iran" correctly, while Sanders speaks about Eye-ran.

NickKristof	688922317506883584	2016-01-18T03:14:14	This debate plays to Sanders' strength, which is anger at system unfairness--not to Clinton's, which is knowledge, experience, electability.
NickKristof	688921243123367936	2016-01-18T03:09:58	Listen to the Democrats tonight, and the Republicans a few days ago. And no one can say there isn't a difference between the parties!
NickKristof	688920598924423168	2016-01-18T03:07:24	That's fair. 
NickKristof	688920450764787713	2016-01-18T03:06:49	Seems silly to focus so much on Sanders' push for single-payer health care. Nice aspiration, but look at Congress. It just won't happen.
NickKristof	688919727599669249	2016-01-18T03:03:57	Hillary Clinton is eminently knowledgeable, but she's in effect calling for continuity at a time when lots of people want discontinuity.

NickKristof	688914020758335488	2016-01-18T02:41:16	I agree that single-payer won't happen any time soon. But I don't think seeking it will dismantle Obamacare. 
NickKristof	688912772332150785	2016-01-18T02:36:18	Now Clinton is disingenuous when she suggests that Sanders wants to tear up Obamacare. He wants an upgrade to single-payer, not downgrade.

NickKristof	688910630888280064	2016-01-18T02:27:48	Sanders is right that drug companies bear some responsibility for the drug crisis: They peddled opiate painkillers to create a new market.

NickKristof	687842297212436481	2016-01-15T03:42:37	Trump is referring to his proposed "business flat tax." Watchers may not realize it's a VAT, value-added tax, similar to a sales tax.
NickKristof	687841433898868736	2016-01-15T03:39:11	Trump's exact words to the nytimes about the China tariff he proposes were: "the tax should be 45 percent." 
NickKristof	687840930309758976	2016-01-15T03:37:11	Rubio makes the important point that US consumers would pay a tariff on Chinese goods. EG no more iPhones.
NickKristof	687840572439171072	2016-01-15T03:35:46	I've met lots of politicians over the decades. Trump is charming--and the most vapid and ill-informed and evasive of the lot.

NickKristof	687838683467255809	2016-01-15T03:28:16	I once asked Trump how he would ban Muslims. Ask people their religion? Or just ban all Arabs, including Christians? He didn't answer.
NickKristof	687837593904480256	2016-01-15T03:23:56	Good for Bush for saying that Trump is "unhinged" for proposing to bar Muslims. An appeal to better angels--who may not vote in GOP primary.

NickKristof	687831326867718144	2016-01-15T02:59:02	Meanwhile, Missouri eased laws on handguns, and gun murders rose 25%. Gun laws aren't a panacea, but they do matter.
NickKristof	687831036210851840	2016-01-15T02:57:52	Rubio seems to think that gun laws are irrelevant. But Connecticut tightened gun laws, and gun homicides fell 40%.
NickKristof	687830444172247040	2016-01-15T02:55:31	Trump and Bush both say mental health is key to gun violence. This is an issue, but mentally ill account for only about 5% of gun crime.
NickKristof	687830061655928832	2016-01-15T02:54:00	Bush says we need to make background checks work better. But now they're easy to evade: 40% of guns are bought without a background check

NickKristof	687824481092550656	2016-01-15T02:31:50	Donald Trump always strikes me as emotionally insecure, desperate for applause and compliments. Actually, lots of politicians like that.
NickKristof	687824217971245056	2016-01-15T02:30:47	Cruz has handled 2 questions--about his birth, about his Goldman Sachs loan--pretty ably. He dodged the GS one, but he's a good debater.
NickKristof	687823647889821697	2016-01-15T02:28:31	Ted Cruz is right that the law is clear: A child of a US citizen born abroad is a "natural-born citizen" eligible for the presidency.

NickKristof	687317567824855040	2016-01-13T16:57:32	telliowkuwp Those were raw tweets written on deadline.
NickKristof	687292093228777472	2016-01-13T15:16:18	On the other hand, if a President Trump were to lead us to war with Iran, maybe he'd get Mexico to pay for it.
NickKristof	687291400040386561	2016-01-13T15:13:33	If Trump were President, don't you think the 10 American sailors would still be held in Iran? And we'd be on the brink of war with Iran?
NickKristof	687291093709393920	2016-01-13T15:12:20	Looking around the world, I'd have to say: The state of the union is not so hot. But better than almost everywhere else.

NickKristof	687245503147433985	2016-01-13T12:11:11	My Take on Obama’s State of the Union Address 
NickKristof	687114352973987840	2016-01-13T03:30:02	This is the highest we've ever tested a SOTU response. 
NickKristof	687115475365564417	2016-01-13T03:34:29	What was interesting about nikkihaley's excellent response to the SOTU was that she was whacking Trump as much as she was Obama.
NickKristof	687114145414668294	2016-01-13T03:29:12	The job ages a guy. 
NickKristof	687114472729763841	2016-01-13T03:30:30	.nikkihaley is doing an excellent job in her Republican response to SOTU. Maybe the most effective response I've seen.
NickKristof	687113117562699776	2016-01-13T03:25:07	Here's my take on Obama's last State of the Union, in the form of collected tweets on it: 
NickKristof	687111524473782272	2016-01-13T03:18:48	Want the NickKristof take on BarackObama's SOTU? Here are his tweets about it: 
NickKristof	687110833592209408	2016-01-13T03:16:03	Cruz and Trump have been the bullies in the schoolyard. Tonight Obama confronted them and spoke for tolerance and decency. Bravo.
NickKristof	687110329260740608	2016-01-13T03:14:03	I thought the speech was thin on details and policy, and glided over foreign policy weaknesses. But he was strong in confronting bigotry.
NickKristof	687109243053469697	2016-01-13T03:09:44	It's hard for Trump to watch the SOTU because the message of inclusiveness and hope makes Obama the anti-Trump! 
NickKristof	687108893709877248	2016-01-13T03:08:20	As a counter to Trump, bravo to Potus for appealing to our better angels rather than our worst prejudices.
NickKristof	687108353777098752	2016-01-13T03:06:12	In another slap at Trump, Obama is warning against scapegoating people "who don't look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do." Yes!
NickKristof	687107892760211458	2016-01-13T03:04:22	The problem of broken politics is, in part, about cynicism. But it's also that money politics gives cynics good reason for cynicism.
NickKristof	687107605869780993	2016-01-13T03:03:13	I agree with Obama about the need to tackle cynicism. But we need to do that in part with new policies--like tackling money in politics.
NickKristof	687107228374044672	2016-01-13T03:01:43	In many ways, Obama's speech is a long response to Trump. To Trump's demagoguery, negativism, and bigotry.
NickKristof	687106788097945600	2016-01-13T02:59:58	Sad to see that some members of Congress were silent and stony faced when Obama denounced anti-Muslim bigotry.
NickKristof	687106486670127104	2016-01-13T02:58:46	Obama has mostly been in law professor mode. But he showed passion when he denounced attacks on Islam as unfair &amp; counterproductive.
NickKristof	687105917813428224	2016-01-13T02:56:31	Bravo to Obama for saying that "when politicians insult Muslims, when a mosque is vandalized...it betrays who we are as a country."
NickKristof	687105627018149888	2016-01-13T02:55:21	Good to see POTUS talking about AIDS and malaria. Hope he follows up; there's a real chance to  defeat both in coming decades.
NickKristof	687105259957817344	2016-01-13T02:53:54	Obama just undermines his credibility when he pretends that his Syria policy--to the extent there is one--is a "smarter approach."
NickKristof	687104867647811584	2016-01-13T02:52:20	Other approaches to Syria might or might not have worked. But after 250,000 deaths &amp; rise of ISIS, Obama's approach definitely failed.
NickKristof	687104719064530945	2016-01-13T02:51:45	Sad to see Obama citing US approach to Syria as a "smarter approach." Syria is Obama's greatest foreign policy failure.
NickKristof	687104467410534400	2016-01-13T02:50:45	Obama cites defeat of Ebola in West Africa. That's genuinely a triumph: a bold military deployment that worked,for which he deserves credit
NickKristof	687104167438118913	2016-01-13T02:49:33	Obama says US foreign policy will "use every element of our national power." But in Ukraine, Syria we've simply been too passive.
NickKristof	687103650049724416	2016-01-13T02:47:30	I'm a good predictor of what the President will say. :)  
NickKristof	687102289287352320	2016-01-13T02:42:06	NickKristof True, but ConnectEd trying to spread best broadband to more lower-income schools to increase personalized learning options
NickKristof	687103006500896768	2016-01-13T02:44:57	For perspective: In the last decade 300 Americans have been killed worldwide by terrorists--and 330,000 Americans have died from guns.
NickKristof	687102779727441920	2016-01-13T02:44:03	"As we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is WWIII just play into their hands." That's true.
NickKristof	687102425820475397	2016-01-13T02:42:38	"Russia is pouring resources to prop up Ukraine"? Hello? More like pouring resources to destabilize Ukraine.
NickKristof	687102102682877956	2016-01-13T02:41:21	"Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected." --Obama SOTU. But after Bush, that's the lowest bar ever.
NickKristof	687101858561835012	2016-01-13T02:40:23	Finally, Paul Ryan wakes up, to salute US troops. Now he'll sit down and nap again.
NickKristof	687101520056311808	2016-01-13T02:39:02	Still 15% of US adults are not on line, including 1/4 of rural adults. When homes don't have Internet access, kids are at a disadvantage.
NickKristof	687100553827086336	2016-01-13T02:35:12	"Let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all." --Obama SOTU
NickKristof	687100313652727809	2016-01-13T02:34:15	Obama brags about getting more low-income Americans on line. Actually, US hasn't done well there. Too many families don't have access.
NickKristof	687099574008311808	2016-01-13T02:31:18	Obama SOTU: "Food stamp recipients didn't cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did." Yes!
NickKristof	687099325583855616	2016-01-13T02:30:19	Obama talks about working with Ryan on EITC for people w/o kids. EITC is a proven poverty fighting measure with bipartisan backing.
NickKristof	687098472630251520	2016-01-13T02:26:56	NickKristof Georgia also uses the lottery to fund its pre-K. Free for all four year-olds.
NickKristof	687098540728934400	2016-01-13T02:27:12	Quick! Can someone call 911 and direct an ambulance to the Capitol? Paul Ryan is motionless, may have fallen unconscious.
NickKristof	687098205587271680	2016-01-13T02:25:52	Pre-k is also vaguely bipartisan. One of the leaders is a red state, Oklahoma--because it's seen as an investment that pays for itself.
NickKristof	687097886463651840	2016-01-13T02:24:36	Great to hear Obama call for pre-k for all. Evidence is overwhelming: That's how you broaden opportunity, by starting early.
NickKristof	687097464030117888	2016-01-13T02:22:55	Fair for POTUS to brag a bit domestically. Unemployment down by half. Deficits by two-thirds. 18 million have gotten health insurance.
NickKristof	687096717641158657	2016-01-13T02:19:57	Obama says first question for US is "how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity?" That's indeed THE fundamental question.
NickKristof	687096040927932417	2016-01-13T02:17:16	Good for Obama for citing paid leave. US is only industrialized country not to guarantee paid maternity leave. Would be a good step for all.
NickKristof	687095421953507330	2016-01-13T02:14:48	As priorities, Obama cites criminal justice reform, curbing gun violence, paid leave, raising minimum wage, dealing with drug abuse.
NickKristof	687093869360640004	2016-01-13T02:08:38	If you see your House member shaking Obama's hand as he walks in, that's because he or she  wasted hours getting a good spot for TV. SOTU

NickKristof	684424536188686336	2016-01-05T17:21:40	Excellent speech by Obama on guns. Pragmatic, reaching out to moderates and gun-owners to support evidence-based steps to make us safer.
NickKristof	684423258238750720	2016-01-05T17:16:35	Obama is in tears as he talks about unnecessary gun deaths. He's passionate about 32,000 Americans dying annually of guns in the US.
NickKristof	684419721626808320	2016-01-05T17:02:32	Great to hear Obama talk about the need for more research on gun violence, to see what policies work. NRA has blocked CDC research on guns.
NickKristof	684419540483203072	2016-01-05T17:01:49	Obama arguing in effect for a public health approach to reducing gun deaths. It won't stop every killing, but will save some lives.
NickKristof	684418826671407105	2016-01-05T16:58:58	"How did we get here?" Obama asks, noting that the NRA itself used to support expanded background checks before buying guns.
NickKristof	684418599075852288	2016-01-05T16:58:04	Obama emphasizes that Americans, including gun-owners, overwhelmingly support universal background checks.
NickKristof	684417815567273984	2016-01-05T16:54:57	One common gun policy problem is that liberals come across as patronizing or insulting to gun-owners; Obama is trying to avoid that.
NickKristof	684417516970598404	2016-01-05T16:53:46	Obama's speech is pragmatic. He notes that many countries have violent people, but we have more lethal violence--because of guns.

NickKristof	684178291553636352	2016-01-05T01:03:10	Whether or not we need them, we're going to have guns. So Obama's right to try to make them and the system safer.
