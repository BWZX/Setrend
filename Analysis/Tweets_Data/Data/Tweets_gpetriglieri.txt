gpetriglieri	724368592410677248	2016-04-24T22:45:05	A gift is never such until you surrender to it, laying the armor of conformity down first. Only then it might reveal itself, like a muse.
gpetriglieri	724368005602377728	2016-04-24T22:42:45	Gift is a common and strange word for a hint of who we might become. Gifts have no price, make few demands. Those hints cost and ask much.

gpetriglieri	710911045947269121	2016-03-18T19:29:36	"A friend of our best intentions" is one of my favorite definitions of a good teacher...
gpetriglieri	710910777750908932	2016-03-18T19:28:32	Experience only reinforces our habits. Unless a friend of our best intentions helps us make new meaning out of it. 
gpetriglieri	710171265294868480	2016-03-16T18:29:58	People don't really care about leaders' soft skills. They care about how leaders help them answer hard questions.
gpetriglieri	710000467745640448	2016-03-16T07:11:17	We owe it to each other to tell stories. 
gpetriglieri	709997695570587649	2016-03-16T07:00:16	Storytelling alters the storyteller. And a story is altered by being told. MOHSIN HAMID  fiction

gpetriglieri	709828556071837697	2016-03-15T19:48:10	Also *granted Prof.gpetriglieri; They do become so when we *give blind commitment &amp; absolute confidence *to leaders 
gpetriglieri	709827686659710976	2016-03-15T19:44:43	Leaders without the courage and freedom to question their story can be convincing, but they can't be wise.
gpetriglieri	709827507822977024	2016-03-15T19:44:00	Leadership is the ability to bring a story to life. Wisdom is the capacity to keep a question alive.
gpetriglieri	709827363903827968	2016-03-15T19:43:26	FabienK1 Not an elective. It's a fairly new mini core course.
gpetriglieri	709826793251983365	2016-03-15T19:41:10	Wisdom and leadership needn't be strange bedfellows. They do become so when we demand blind commitment and absolute confidence from leaders.
gpetriglieri	709826481283846145	2016-03-15T19:39:55	We keep calling for more wisdom in business leaders because we have succeeded in making business leadership antithetical to it.
gpetriglieri	709826321849978881	2016-03-15T19:39:17	The smoothest and most beautiful tales of charismatic leadership end in the same way as the roughest, ugliest ones--in disillusionment.
gpetriglieri	709826225645166592	2016-03-15T19:38:54	First we encourage tribal leadership, asking it to spread "our" values and maximize "our" gains. Then we complain that leaders are divisive.
gpetriglieri	709825850947063808	2016-03-15T19:37:25	Much of what we call leadership, and teach and ask aspiring leaders, is still the ability to stand out in, and for, a tribe.
gpetriglieri	709825704817532928	2016-03-15T19:36:50	7 hours teaching 'practical wisdom' in the insead MBA today. 7 more tomorrow. So many good insights from these conversations.
gpetriglieri	709820771367985152	2016-03-15T19:17:14	Don't get sucked in by "unicornism." Odds of becoming a unicorn same as winning the lottery. Just do great work.
gpetriglieri	709427727250661376	2016-03-14T17:15:25	Great Leaders don't always do Good. And the greater the leader, the more controversial the good.
gpetriglieri	709424562220437506	2016-03-14T17:02:50	Great Leaders rise and fall with fashions and times. The desire for great leadership never does.
gpetriglieri	709424464296026112	2016-03-14T17:02:27	The demise of one Great Leader only stirs up our appetite for the next. Which is the problem.
gpetriglieri	709423924203937793	2016-03-14T17:00:18	Never confuse the demise of the Great Leader du jour with the demise of public appetite for Great Leaders. One only feeds the other.
gpetriglieri	709422849258352640	2016-03-14T16:56:02	The demise of the Great Leader was only temporary after all. I concur.

gpetriglieri	709115791367643136	2016-03-13T20:35:54	Civilized leadership is far wiser and more beautiful than the tribal kind. But hardly as exciting. See exhibit 1. 
gpetriglieri	709115186297364480	2016-03-13T20:33:29	Indeed, it's a mass psychology (a culture), hardly confined to one domain.  
gpetriglieri	709114408203624452	2016-03-13T20:30:24	Rubio running for critical scholar in chief again. 
gpetriglieri	709113594504486916	2016-03-13T20:27:10	The struggle between tribalism and civilization is coming to define our times. And it must be fought within first, for civilization to win.
gpetriglieri	709111926140358656	2016-03-13T20:20:32	You don't defeat tribal leadership with stronger tribal leadership. You don't defeat it at all. You only transcend it, with civilization.
gpetriglieri	709109601879400448	2016-03-13T20:11:18	Tribal leadership is not a solution to weak institutions--it's a symptom of their dissolution.
gpetriglieri	709108908946800640	2016-03-13T20:08:33	Trump is what happens when you suggest that a tribal kind of visionary leadership is the solution to hollow institutions long enough.
gpetriglieri	709107531822538756	2016-03-13T20:03:04	Rarely a leader's rise has matched so closely Freud's pessimistic theories on mass psychology and identification with the aggressor.

gpetriglieri	707624652361830401	2016-03-09T17:50:38	The best leaders recognize our concerns, rekindle our hopes, and do not exploit our fears.
gpetriglieri	707624006954909696	2016-03-09T17:48:04	True leaders do not just make and keep promises. They help others to fulfill their promise.

gpetriglieri	704063224161964033	2016-02-28T21:58:48	This reminds me of another famous quote, about the risk of ignoring history--that we repeat it.  
gpetriglieri	703482068915855360	2016-02-27T07:29:29	Pasta meets self help: this is a perfect headline. 
gpetriglieri	703480948831158273	2016-02-27T07:25:02	Smart demagogues always use their opponents' claims that they are unhinged to fuel their followers' support. Bullies are always under siege.
gpetriglieri	703480412551696384	2016-02-27T07:22:55	It's always an outraging surprise to realize that some call leadership what we call insane. The question is, then what?
gpetriglieri	703479627390558208	2016-02-27T07:19:47	If anything the Trump rise shows that there might be a lot of BS about leadership, but leadership is not BS. It has serious consequences.
gpetriglieri	703479057414037504	2016-02-27T07:17:31	"If it's not good (for "us") it isn't leadership" is an argument that always falls on deaf ears if enough of "them" believe it is.
gpetriglieri	703478019512524804	2016-02-27T07:13:24	The argument that Trump isn't a leader is appealing, to us, but it rests on a wish--that leadership should always be good.

gpetriglieri	702568529741094912	2016-02-24T18:59:25	"Leadership industry" is a misleading term. Makes it sound like it just fulfills a need--for skills, or dreams, or culture. c joshuarothman
