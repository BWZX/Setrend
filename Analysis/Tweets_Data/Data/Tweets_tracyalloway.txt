tracyalloway	715975197090824196	2016-04-01T18:52:43	RobinWigg _bmturner_ LadyFOHF Other thing that has made it a bigger deal now - trading revenue down and syndicate fees become crucial.
tracyalloway	715970214719045632	2016-04-01T18:32:55	LadyFOHF xvrmdf RobinWigg Because it skews the whole market and makes the big guys bigger. New issue alpha is like their life force.
tracyalloway	715969845150543872	2016-04-01T18:31:27	LadyFOHF xvrmdf RobinWigg Not a secret but I feel it's become a much bigger issue given size and hotness of corp debt market recent years
tracyalloway	715969260653297664	2016-04-01T18:29:08	RobinWigg _bmturner_ I said same thing earlier on Twitter and have linked the two before

tracyalloway	715967625994612736	2016-04-01T18:22:38	mattperez83 Right, and the bigger end up getting bigger b/c they get the new issue alpha! Total inequality.
tracyalloway	715967381194059776	2016-04-01T18:21:40	followtheh By contrast, corp. debt has grown immensely but, last time I checked, the SEC has one person devoting HALF his time to it.
tracyalloway	715967264185561089	2016-04-01T18:21:12	followtheh Right, but my major concern here is that there is a lot of scrutiny of the IPO market.
tracyalloway	715966831698296832	2016-04-01T18:19:29	Now I'm done and I ♥ Matt etc.
tracyalloway	715966726693908480	2016-04-01T18:19:04	Which looks built on what is essentially a giant corner by the lucky few who get large allocations of debt.
tracyalloway	715966687267459072	2016-04-01T18:18:54	Which again, is great for the big guys (and the banks who get syndicate fees) but potentially not the entire corporate debt market.
tracyalloway	715966587170369538	2016-04-01T18:18:31	The big guys get big portions of new issues locked up, which squeezes prices on the rest of the available float higher
tracyalloway	715966553431392256	2016-04-01T18:18:23	BUT this dynamic impacts the rest of the market.
tracyalloway	715966502403514369	2016-04-01T18:18:10	And we have very little insight into how banks allocate such debt. (They can easily argue that they are finding the best buy and hold guys)
tracyalloway	715966335050727424	2016-04-01T18:17:30	BUT the problem is investors who are locked out of the deal definitely do not win.
tracyalloway	715966305418010625	2016-04-01T18:17:23	Investors happy ‘cause they can monetize immediate gain + issuers are happy b/c the deal looks slam dunk (tho they leave money on the table)
tracyalloway	715966134147801088	2016-04-01T18:16:43	Bankers could sell them for less but choose not to because - to an extent -everyone involved in the deal wins from underpricing debt.
tracyalloway	715966051050192896	2016-04-01T18:16:23	Given high competition for new issues deals are heavily oversubscribed.
tracyalloway	715966019441987584	2016-04-01T18:16:15	The new issue 'pop' is all but guaranteed given hefty demand for debt in a low yield environment.
tracyalloway	715965960436510720	2016-04-01T18:16:01	But, the problem in recent years is that they are not *actually* assuming much risk here.
tracyalloway	715965887593979904	2016-04-01T18:15:44	Yes investors (and bankers) should be rewarded for assuming the risk of buying a big slug of an illiquid position like corporate debt.
