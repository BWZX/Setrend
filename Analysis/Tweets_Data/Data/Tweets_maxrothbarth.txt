maxrothbarth	682354693029412864	2015-12-31T00:16:51	jeremyduns This isn't about metadata. I also don't understand what you mean when you say Snowden "fiddled" two articles. How do you mean?
maxrothbarth	682354233375592448	2015-12-31T00:15:01	jeremyduns No. You tweeted a lot. You didn't address the point I've just raised. You explicitly say Alexander talked about metadata.
