TimothyNoah1	721078911891808257	2016-04-15T20:53:04	mattyglesias Jesselansner I admire the élan of this argument but it's not strictly speaking true.

TimothyNoah1	721078355991375872	2016-04-15T20:50:51	mattyglesias What's interesting is that often when the scarcity factor is removed by turning a play into a film the critics all say:
TimothyNoah1	721077827160969216	2016-04-15T20:48:45	21. The End
TimothyNoah1	721077795376537600	2016-04-15T20:48:38	20. ... and say it stinks.
TimothyNoah1	721077754209378307	2016-04-15T20:48:28	19. And he'd love to write about how once a critical mass of had seen and adored "Hamilton" the cognoscenti will suddenly reverse field...
TimothyNoah1	721077455696576512	2016-04-15T20:47:17	18. ... into conversation that they saw it and isn't it marvelous.
TimothyNoah1	721077354022486016	2016-04-15T20:46:52	17. You know who would REALLY love "Hamilton"? Thorstein Veblen, that's who. He'd love to write about the way people drop ...
TimothyNoah1	721077060639318016	2016-04-15T20:45:42	16. It's a luxury item. It's like cocaine in the 1970s, when only a select few cool kids were chosen to snort in the john.
TimothyNoah1	721076598368243713	2016-04-15T20:43:52	15. The message of all "Hamilton" worshipers is "I saw 'Hamilton' and you didn't."
TimothyNoah1	721076068183056384	2016-04-15T20:41:46	14. Because that's how snobbery works. And "Hamilton" has a gigantic snob cult surrounding it, apart from any intrinsic merit it may possess
TimothyNoah1	721075736816283648	2016-04-15T20:40:27	13. Or: "'Hamilton'? I never said I liked 'Hamilton.' It's sooo 2015. Nobody likes 'Hamilton.'"
TimothyNoah1	721075327003422721	2016-04-15T20:38:49	12. Or: "You saw the road company? [Pause.] You really had to see it in New York."
TimothyNoah1	721075202218700800	2016-04-15T20:38:19	11. Or: "You didn't see the original cast? Oh. [Pause.] You really had to see the original cast."
TimothyNoah1	721075026552819716	2016-04-15T20:37:37	10. "Oh, you saw it in April? The original cast has been phoning it in since March. You really needed to see it before February."
TimothyNoah1	721074666555731969	2016-04-15T20:36:12	9. The SECOND I said I liked--no, LOVED--"Hamilton," here's what the "Hamilton" cult would tell me:
TimothyNoah1	721074492202696704	2016-04-15T20:35:30	8. Let's say I was prepared to babble about the greatness of "Hamilton" just like everyone else. You know what would happen?
TimothyNoah1	721074314309722112	2016-04-15T20:34:48	7. Let's say I didn't just like "Hamilton" (nobody seems to just like "Hamilton") but LOVED it.
TimothyNoah1	721074136924229632	2016-04-15T20:34:05	6. But let's say five grand dropped from the sky and I bought myself a pair of "Hamilton" tix. And let's say I liked it.
TimothyNoah1	721073772997013506	2016-04-15T20:32:39	5. Or some ad guy saying Volkswagen could get past emissions scandal by making commercial with the "Hamilton" cast. 
TimothyNoah1	721072914376876032	2016-04-15T20:29:14	4. For instance, the First Lady saying it's "the best piece of art in any form I have ever seen in my life." 
TimothyNoah1	721072475002560512	2016-04-15T20:27:29	3. My answer: Liking "Hamilton" would never stop me from lampooning the more obviously foolish things people are saying about it.
TimothyNoah1	721072071648919552	2016-04-15T20:25:53	2. Wouldn't you have to stop lampooning its giddy press coverage?
TimothyNoah1	721071880866807809	2016-04-15T20:25:07	1. People ask me: What would happen if you actually went to "Hamilton" and liked it?

TimothyNoah1	718882616850661376	2016-04-09T19:25:46	11. This person had a spotless reputation, the general feeling being he wasn't quite smart or devious enough to get himself into trouble.
TimothyNoah1	718882267792322561	2016-04-09T19:24:23	10. So the House did the next best thing and chose DeLay's deputy whip, a harmless, perfectly likeable fellow who never gave DeLay any guff.

TimothyNoah1	718877877534605312	2016-04-09T19:06:56	4. Result: Gingrich stepped down as speaker. An ethical reprimand the prior year and Gingrich's history of marital infidelity didn't help.

TimothyNoah1	683083461733806080	2016-01-02T00:32:43	jackshafer hiattf I guarantee you Post would not have made such endorsements over Don's (or Kay's) strong objections.
TimothyNoah1	683083175732613120	2016-01-02T00:31:34	jackshafer Oh, I'm sure he has a handful of hobby horses and don't-go-there's. Mostly I bet he doesn't care. Not like Don. He lived here!
TimothyNoah1	683082539460853764	2016-01-02T00:29:03	dangillmor Here's mine. 
TimothyNoah1	683082301673181186	2016-01-02T00:28:06	jackshafer hiattf Counterargument was stronger then--Don Graham still was running the place.
TimothyNoah1	683082133242527746	2016-01-02T00:27:26	jackshafer hiattf I seem to recall Fred telling me when I first posted the Slate piece that he rather strongly disagreed.
TimothyNoah1	683081804333625344	2016-01-02T00:26:07	jackshafer Old model. The "owner" is now seldom local. At Post, f'r instance.
TimothyNoah1	683081557238755329	2016-01-02T00:25:08	evanasmith cautious choice.
TimothyNoah1	683081505887903745	2016-01-02T00:24:56	evanasmith It's not a perfect model for democratic representation I grant you. But I feel I can depend on the Post to make an appropriately
TimothyNoah1	683081193588396037	2016-01-02T00:23:42	evanasmith ... than I ever would. Who should be the at-large city councilman? How the hell should I know?
TimothyNoah1	683081000134508544	2016-01-02T00:22:56	evanasmith I'm not interested in most of the WashPost's opinions but in local electoral matters I depend on it to pay closer attention...
TimothyNoah1	683079946475028486	2016-01-02T00:18:44	evanasmith I disagree with you there. I'd keep those.
TimothyNoah1	683078917419307009	2016-01-02T00:14:39	daveberns My point is that Post editorials will never reflect Bezos views to anything like extent they once reflected Don and Kay Graham's.
TimothyNoah1	683078310440615937	2016-01-02T00:12:14	mbranom I'm guessing not.
TimothyNoah1	683078040730087424	2016-01-02T00:11:10	AlexParkerDC MichaelMcGough3 As I said in my piece papers could still run edits on rare occasions when necessary &amp; get more attention.
TimothyNoah1	683077750211608578	2016-01-02T00:10:01	daveberns He's got other fish to fry.
TimothyNoah1	683077437807312896	2016-01-02T00:08:46	AlexParkerDC MichaelMcGough3 Newspapers don't have opinions! Chain owners may have one opinion in one city &amp; opposite in another!
TimothyNoah1	683076929373782016	2016-01-02T00:06:45	daveberns You honestly think Bezos cares who gets elected DC city council president???
TimothyNoah1	683076728193953793	2016-01-02T00:05:57	daveberns Oh, I'm sure he has a few pet subjects. But mostly he prolly doesn't care. He lives 3000 miles away!
TimothyNoah1	683076451604758529	2016-01-02T00:04:51	Dsquared75 You can do that better in op-Eds, which people more likely read.
TimothyNoah1	683076255206510592	2016-01-02T00:04:04	MichaelMcGough3 Problem with that is if you keep an editboard it represents a unified POV--probably just what newspapers DON'T need.
TimothyNoah1	683075693568208896	2016-01-02T00:01:50	6. Editpages were voice of publishers back when publishers were local. I doubt Bezos gives much of a crap what opinions WashPost spouts.
TimothyNoah1	683075032202014722	2016-01-01T23:59:13	MichaelMcGough3 When I wrote my Slate piece Kinsley, then editpage editor at LAT, didn't strongly disagree. 
TimothyNoah1	683074205005574144	2016-01-01T23:55:56	MichaelMcGough3 Nobody wants to be the vulgarian who does it first. But it makes sense. Me, I like to know whose opinion it is I'm reading.
TimothyNoah1	683073872367894528	2016-01-01T23:54:36	5. Newspapers could still, with many fewer Ed page staffers, supply editorials on rare occasions when needed. 
TimothyNoah1	683073333445931008	2016-01-01T23:52:28	4. I made this case ten years ago in Slate. The institutional reasons for newspaper editorials no longer exist. 
TimothyNoah1	683073074078547968	2016-01-01T23:51:26	3.) More op-Eds, more room for unusual editorial voices like Meyerson's, and more interesting content altogether.
TimothyNoah1	683072687447642117	2016-01-01T23:49:54	2. You'd save the Post (&amp; other newspapers) a lot more money if you eliminated editorials and had two op-Ed pages instead.
TimothyNoah1	683072219333935105	2016-01-01T23:48:02	1. It's a cinch that, whatever Harold Meyerson's clicks were, they exceeded those for WashPost editorials.
TimothyNoah1	683008112069079044	2016-01-01T19:33:18	mettlinger noamscheiber That's just my guess, but it's based on casual observation.
TimothyNoah1	683007959383851008	2016-01-01T19:32:41	mettlinger noamscheiber This entire conversation between we three is occurring among people who, to most Americans, are rich.
TimothyNoah1	683007472811008000	2016-01-01T19:30:45	mettlinger noamscheiber It's big because the top 10 percent demands inclusion in it against all mathematic logic.
TimothyNoah1	683007168921120768	2016-01-01T19:29:33	mettlinger noamscheiber To summarize: Elite's belief that $200k = "middle class" helps explain working class alienation.
TimothyNoah1	683004483073372160	2016-01-01T19:18:53	mettlinger noamscheiber Yes but in doing so you deny recognition of/ empathy for life in bottom 90 percent.
TimothyNoah1	683003737447772161	2016-01-01T19:15:55	noamscheiber mettlinger Agree, and that's what I say in my book. (I call for restoration of pre-Reagan 70 percent top marginal rate).
TimothyNoah1	683002965033136129	2016-01-01T19:12:51	noamscheiber mettlinger Yes. But runaway income concentration at tippy top shouldn't allow $200k earners to claim they're middle class.
TimothyNoah1	683002383597748225	2016-01-01T19:10:32	noamscheiber mettlinger True.
TimothyNoah1	683002334813753345	2016-01-01T19:10:20	noamscheiber mettlinger Correct.
TimothyNoah1	683002263409930240	2016-01-01T19:10:03	noamscheiber mettlinger I agree with that.
TimothyNoah1	682995177456316416	2016-01-01T18:41:54	levine_bruce Hesiod2k11 noamscheiber How many kids you have is often a function of income!
TimothyNoah1	682994863462334464	2016-01-01T18:40:39	levine_bruce ElBuehn noamscheiber That's because you compare yourself only to those who make more.
TimothyNoah1	682994507802099712	2016-01-01T18:39:14	mettlinger noamscheiber The two issues are linked. Obama shielded incomes below $200k from taxes on grounds they were "middle class."
TimothyNoah1	682980721506521088	2016-01-01T17:44:27	levine_bruce noamscheiber If you don't think 90th percentile is rich then don't congratulate your kid when he scores 90 on a test.
TimothyNoah1	682980405499277312	2016-01-01T17:43:12	levine_bruce noamscheiber $150-$200k puts you above 90th percentile.
TimothyNoah1	682980180839796736	2016-01-01T17:42:18	$150-$200k is rich, just not as rich as the 1 percent. NYT readers choose not to believe this. 2/2. noamscheiber 
TimothyNoah1	682979412388769792	2016-01-01T17:39:15	One quibble: people who make $150-$200k are not distinct group from "the rich." 1/2 noamscheiber.
