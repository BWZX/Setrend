spz_trader	722876578611335168	2016-04-20T19:56:21	EnergyRosen I expected volatility from $20s to maybe 40.  The "sustained" volatility at this point is headscratcher

spz_trader	722870705964994560	2016-04-20T19:33:01	Case in point.  Spooz have rallied hard but I could make a case techincally &amp; fundamentally.  I have been picking

spz_trader	722860232473358336	2016-04-20T18:51:24	I like to trade the "back &amp; forth" pf Crude.  Right now, no back &amp; forth just one direction. Fine, but higher we go bigger the risk. No ty

spz_trader	722857659850883072	2016-04-20T18:41:10	ES_F - If crude doesnt back down then a 50-60 handle pullback is reasonable imho  Let'em pop up towards 2114.75  My two cents!
spz_trader	722857124733132801	2016-04-20T18:39:03	ES_F - This parabolic move in crude is NOT good.  Higher prices was good due to  energy companies huge debt. This move to the moon is bad

spz_trader	722855264123158529	2016-04-20T18:31:39	mark_dow  that is what I am afraid of at this point.  Somewhere there will be a trap door.

spz_trader	720282390690594816	2016-04-13T16:07:58	InterestArb ur righ but I think there was a lot of short-covering leading up into yesterday.  Rally is suspect but traders scared to short
spz_trader	720282008698511360	2016-04-13T16:06:27	OilTrader305 if RBOB gets abv 5280 with sticking power, Currently  5271  bears in crude will run for cover
spz_trader	720281786916282368	2016-04-13T16:05:34	The pullback in crude can get nasty. Bout the time no one wants to sell it then the bottom falls out.  Look at euro at 146
spz_trader	720281197973102592	2016-04-13T16:03:14	I think today is where crude can potentially roll over   but RBOB will call the last tune

spz_trader	719975688107728896	2016-04-12T19:49:15	jeanienyc I dont hav temperament hold trades. Wish i did. Dont have the mental makeup to do it.  I can only short term trade.  shortcoming
spz_trader	719974945007120384	2016-04-12T19:46:18	jeanienyc  it prolly sounds idiotic if I dont take long $/Cad but if Im in a trade even if small I keep looking at it. Not my type trade

spz_trader	719973932980305921	2016-04-12T19:42:16	jeanienyc thx but honestly not risky call.  Looking  for 700 pips. You risk 200.   Thats almost 4:1  BUT  I dont see it sliding a whole lot

spz_trader	719963096056508417	2016-04-12T18:59:13	blacgold76 .. The return move once or twice. Im all abt small moves &amp; feeling how the mkt sets itself up. Case in point on pit session..

spz_trader	719961575080202241	2016-04-12T18:53:10	Bank research from three wks back was all abt spreading Brent (sell) v Wti. I thinka ton of short-covering in Brent today imho

spz_trader	715466069364883456	2016-03-31T09:09:38	MvP_Trades expect a pullback of sorts before extended leg higher. Simply a "valuation" play as mkt has come so far ahead of big report
spz_trader	715465736450351104	2016-03-31T09:08:18	MvP_Trades ggod point.  There is no doubt Fed will be on hold for a while. That being said a nice NFP is a price risk for bulls so still

spz_trader	708022674081984514	2016-03-10T20:12:14	BrynneandRic There are awesome scalping opportunities until the mkt figures itself out without puttin one's self at huge risk
spz_trader	708022438743773184	2016-03-10T20:11:18	BrynneandRic so the risk is Brent can move higher on a re-test. everyone knows it so best to take on the mkt next week unless scalping
spz_trader	708022239086510080	2016-03-10T20:10:30	BrynneandRic The way I look at it is funds who got long 2 weeks ago may hav lightened up on some longs on Tuesday but still doing well
spz_trader	708021310090129408	2016-03-10T20:06:49	BrynneandRic I think peeps treading lightly as we move towards end of week.  Much easier to come in fresh on Monday than worry abt weekend

spz_trader	708010433601343488	2016-03-10T19:23:36	A narrative is not something in concrete.  Early last week I shared Reuters article funds long Brent for more than two weeks thus underlying

spz_trader	708003385933303808	2016-03-10T18:55:35	BrynneandRic yeah, but I believe energy mkts  scared to get aggressive on the short side unless Brent loses 3974

spz_trader	701055610352054272	2016-02-20T14:47:37	stodders79 Yes, that was me.  I trade levels, fibs (which crude responds to well) &amp; "price structure".  Euro is conducive to same approach
spz_trader	701054396788912128	2016-02-20T14:42:47	stodders79 ..Ppl try and complicate things &amp; price move. If you think abt "price structure" then a pullback made sense at that time.
spz_trader	701054036301099008	2016-02-20T14:41:21	stodders79 .. Saudi FM said "no cuts" then all those who had put on longs had to neutralize positions, so we worked lower for next 36 hours
spz_trader	701053757505691648	2016-02-20T14:40:15	stodders79 No, but the mkt (price) needed to "balance out".  THe mkt was open to a move to $35.  We were trading $34.10 when news came out
spz_trader	701047685025964033	2016-02-20T14:16:07	So many ppl missed the crude rally cuz they could only think in "absolutes"  Iran offered "lip service" to break the sell momentum Thats all
