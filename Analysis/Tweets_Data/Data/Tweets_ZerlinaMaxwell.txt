ZerlinaMaxwell	697901994988564480	2016-02-11T21:56:16	I have a picture w/ John Lewis from Selma but I bet if you asked him if he knows who Zerlina is he wouldn't know. Stop it with this picture.
ZerlinaMaxwell	697901751907807235	2016-02-11T21:55:18	Bernie folks out here making memes calling John Lewis a liar are doing it all wrong. Just no.

ZerlinaMaxwell	697816477899083776	2016-02-11T16:16:27	The idea of Bernie Sanders, who has little to show for his 25 years in Congress, giving leadership lectures to President Obama is absurd.
ZerlinaMaxwell	697837346746560512	2016-02-11T17:39:23	Between this John Lewis business and HowToTalkToBlackWomen, the Sanders campaign isn't having the best day.

ZerlinaMaxwell	697497336898043905	2016-02-10T19:08:18	Sanders and Clinton both served in Congress at the same time, that would be the more logical place to start comparing their records.

ZerlinaMaxwell	697440646957817857	2016-02-10T15:23:02	So: Hillary is still accountable for the 1994 crime bill because she was FLOTUS. Bernie voted for it, but it's ok because he didn't mean it?
