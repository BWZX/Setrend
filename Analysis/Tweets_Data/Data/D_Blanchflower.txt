D_Blanchflower	709492112388177920	2016-03-14T21:31:15	Alan_Krueger no it does not i am simply going to follow the data as sensible policy makers should
D_Blanchflower	709491657226510336	2016-03-14T21:29:27	Alan_Krueger actually it was flat
D_Blanchflower	709491551899140099	2016-03-14T21:29:02	Alan_Krueger  i will follow my mate andrewtlevin and engage in 'watchful waiting' as the fed should  
D_Blanchflower	709490578539552768	2016-03-14T21:25:10	Alan_Krueger actually the young are a major part of lfpr fall my estimate is that 3m more will move into lf as US moves to full empt
D_Blanchflower	709490026242031616	2016-03-14T21:22:58	Alan_Krueger hard to argue all about demographics when almost every other country has same but no fall in lfpr eg UK Germany
D_Blanchflower	709489528462036992	2016-03-14T21:20:59	t0nyyates Alan_Krueger well certainly it takes a while to get the data I agree I like the PMIs which are unrevised and timely
D_Blanchflower	709489335440166912	2016-03-14T21:20:13	Alan_Krueger everyone does not most of driver in falling lfpr is actually among the young who likely will return when there are more jobs
D_Blanchflower	709489058356002816	2016-03-14T21:19:07	Alan_Krueger disagree with that totally most of the fall in lfpr is cyclical lots of other countries eg UK had same demographics &amp; no fall
D_Blanchflower	709488844102574080	2016-03-14T21:18:16	t0nyyates Alan_Krueger ok but down revisions to nominal GDP in UK last 3mths turn out to be most important macro data release - right?
D_Blanchflower	709488378501337088	2016-03-14T21:16:25	Alan_Krueger hard to believe an epop nearly 4ppts below 2008 levels means US is anywhere close to full empt along with lots underempt also
D_Blanchflower	709486870728732674	2016-03-14T21:10:26	Alan_Krueger one thing I learnt doing monetary policy is how hard it is to work out where you are revisions drive all - not like laborecon
D_Blanchflower	709486319941111808	2016-03-14T21:08:14	Alan_Krueger You asserted there was no recession with great certainty my view is odds are probably around 50/50 gdp revisions likely big
D_Blanchflower	709485396900646912	2016-03-14T21:04:34	Alan_Krueger so you just know there will be no revisions to past gdp data - how exactly?
D_Blanchflower	709484971992465408	2016-03-14T21:02:53	Alan_Krueger the NBER recession dating committee dated recession dec1st 2008 a year after the recession started in dec2007 if i recall
D_Blanchflower	709484224181575684	2016-03-14T20:59:55	Alan_Krueger for monetary policy makers the backcast is often harder than the forecast

D_Blanchflower	709481555182358532	2016-03-14T20:49:18	Alan_Krueger totally right about real wages and you have been totally wrong about lfpr and lt unemployment hence why no nominal wage growth
D_Blanchflower	709480309826392064	2016-03-14T20:44:22	Alan_Krueger suppose the us was already in recession your deliberative predetermined pace would be disastrous
D_Blanchflower	709480013922476032	2016-03-14T20:43:11	Alan_Krueger you mean just like the ecb &amp; Swedish rijksbank started to raise rates at a deliberative pace? Didn't go well for them did it?
D_Blanchflower	709479424039714816	2016-03-14T20:40:50	Alan_Krueger fed precisely should not raise rates particip rate will continue to rise lt unempd will continue to get jobs as they have been
D_Blanchflower	709478346925711360	2016-03-14T20:36:34	Alan_Krueger nominal wage growth is flat at 2% inflation moving back to 2% target is that the justification for you wanting a rate rise?
D_Blanchflower	709476594092474369	2016-03-14T20:29:36	Alan_Krueger expected wage growth to rise for a while andrewtlevin &amp; I show that will not occur as lots lmkt slack 
D_Blanchflower	709475818309869568	2016-03-14T20:26:31	alan_krueger real wages should start to grow when the unemployment rate falls below 5.5% andrewtlevin &amp; I disagree 
D_Blanchflower	709475432320671744	2016-03-14T20:24:59	Participation rate WILL continue to rise lots of LTU will take jobs alan_krueger totally wrong fed shouldn't raise

D_Blanchflower	706912967913123844	2016-03-07T18:42:40	exactly the point - US economy contrary to what Fischer claims is a long way from full-empt hence no wage growth

D_Blanchflower	706911024830554112	2016-03-07T18:34:56	JimmyManning85 sorry wrong - workers want more hours at the going price because there are less hours of work under offer than they want

D_Blanchflower	706909370240512001	2016-03-07T18:28:22	Fischer really should stick to 70s macro theory rather than say stuff about US economy in 2016 he doesnt understand
