SpiegelPeter	716227073317158912	2016-04-02T11:33:35	patrikakis Citing a newspaper unfamiliar with Greece that cites Wikileaks isn't a source. Read the transcript: 
SpiegelPeter	716226762775113728	2016-04-02T11:32:21	GioAlexopoulos Later on, he says: "I hope for the sake of Greece that we are going to find a solution soon." He's frustrated at EU.
SpiegelPeter	716226630801342465	2016-04-02T11:31:50	GioAlexopoulos Yes, he's talking about EU decision-making. They never do anything until the last minute.
SpiegelPeter	716226196820852737	2016-04-02T11:30:06	lakisleykos They've pushed it since at least November 2012. Juncker and Lagarde fought about it: 
SpiegelPeter	716225860139933696	2016-04-02T11:28:46	patrikakis Where is that in the transcript? I don't see that. IMF frustrated that EU has done this in the past, but they're not advocates
SpiegelPeter	716225638311575552	2016-04-02T11:27:53	mariannalemos Maybe I'm just more used to this than you are. This is how all sides have discussed the Greek programme for 6 years.

SpiegelPeter	716225256063639552	2016-04-02T11:26:22	stephenkinsella Hmm. You're welcome to your opinion on how I report, but my story makes clear these are previously-stated IMF views.
SpiegelPeter	716225031492251648	2016-04-02T11:25:28	stephenkinsella I agree. Restates known IMF position. Still, fun bit of colour!
SpiegelPeter	716224616872734721	2016-04-02T11:23:50	We hardly needed wikileaks to tell us the IMF is pushing for debt relief or not participating in bailout in Greece 
SpiegelPeter	716224362408443905	2016-04-02T11:22:49	stephenkinsella Was IMF's position "leaked" before our stated publicly outright? Thomsen's been pretty clear: 
SpiegelPeter	716223849453457408	2016-04-02T11:20:47	thefertilesun You may not agree debt should be paid, but it's not illegal.
SpiegelPeter	716223721699205122	2016-04-02T11:20:16	GioAlexopoulos Where does it say that in transcript?
SpiegelPeter	716223627268636673	2016-04-02T11:19:54	howserob But doesn't it show that IMF is frustrated with Germany? It was Schauble who said no debt relief in March: 
SpiegelPeter	716223450801696768	2016-04-02T11:19:12	some_onesome_wh Lagarde personally appointed Thomsen as head of European dept. I don't see her letting him go over private transcript leak.
SpiegelPeter	716223191627202564	2016-04-02T11:18:10	thefertilesun Hmm. Hard to debate with someone who doesn't agree on fundamental principles. So I guess I'll leave you to that opinion.
SpiegelPeter	716222940270968832	2016-04-02T11:17:10	lakisleykos Certainly since Syriza was elected last January.
SpiegelPeter	716220824953479169	2016-04-02T11:08:46	some_onesome_wh I think there's misreading of "event"  here. IMF frustrated EU not making decision &amp; can't figure out when they will
SpiegelPeter	716220373965135872	2016-04-02T11:06:58	thefertilesun But way programme is structured it's a simple trade-off: If you want lower fiscal targets, you need to lower debt payments
SpiegelPeter	716219732836368384	2016-04-02T11:04:25	dim70 Only if EU won't agree to lower surplus targets. That's clear from the transcript. OpenEurope
SpiegelPeter	716219535729274880	2016-04-02T11:03:38	danielmunevar Yes, you're right. But as Thomsen says in the transcript, EU won't go for it. So they'll need bigger debt relief.
SpiegelPeter	716219368124858368	2016-04-02T11:02:58	MehreenKhn Hate the playa, love the game? 
SpiegelPeter	716218881833115648	2016-04-02T11:01:02	thefertilesun I think it is that simple. It's basic maths. IMF has already said publicly no debt payments for 30-40yrs.
SpiegelPeter	716218658121519104	2016-04-02T11:00:09	howserob But again, it's in Greece's interest to get a decision quickly. IMF "brinkmanship" is trying to get EU to move quickly.
SpiegelPeter	716218319326560256	2016-04-02T10:58:48	danielmunevar Absolutely. But those who follow this closely knew IMF was pushing for a 1.5% PS for some time...EU can't support, tho
SpiegelPeter	716217433749585920	2016-04-02T10:55:17	.some_onesome_wh Why would Thomsen resign? Transcript is basically what he's said publicly on his blog. 
SpiegelPeter	716217207760560128	2016-04-02T10:54:23	thefertilesun Because IMF believes higher surpluses would force too much austerity. So lower debt burden &amp; ease surplus targets.
SpiegelPeter	716216710605488128	2016-04-02T10:52:25	lempessi Yes, clearly not European (particularly German) priorities. But why would that be anti-Greek?
