benthompson	725008196515991552	2016-04-26T17:06:38	lutherlowe like I said a few tweets ago, we can agree to disagree on that specific point.
benthompson	725007504518705152	2016-04-26T17:03:53	lutherlowe you're making my point: Microsoft got 95% browser share to what end? Future was web front door, not runtime
benthompson	725005943365226496	2016-04-26T16:57:41	lutherlowe well, that's why I spent 1500 words saying how it could be done better if indeed you're right. I'm on the fence.
benthompson	725005763970666497	2016-04-26T16:56:58	lutherlowe Google would have been too before Microsoft realized what was going on. Going after Netscape = not understanding Internet

benthompson	725003772410220545	2016-04-26T16:49:03	lutherlowe as an analogy, I don't think there's anything Google can do about Facebook even though own Android
benthompson	725003530138882048	2016-04-26T16:48:06	lutherlowe we can agree to disagree. I don't think they could have stopped Google, and the real death knell was mobile anyways.
benthompson	725003188949016576	2016-04-26T16:46:44	LtColMayne no question but I think it's used as a scapegoat for failings that have other explanations
benthompson	725000788175523840	2016-04-26T16:37:12	lutherlowe and how precisely would they have done that...

benthompson	723020224438489088	2016-04-21T05:27:09	btaylor absolutely. I'd frame it as a necessary but insufficient sort of thing
benthompson	723020078459953153	2016-04-21T05:26:34	btaylor as for Google, note that Android was completely separate
benthompson	723019944061870081	2016-04-21T05:26:02	btaylor I don't think services and iPhones can live in the same org. So Apple needs 2 functional orgs, if that makes sense
benthompson	723019787543056384	2016-04-21T05:25:25	btaylor that's not quite what I'm saying -- all divisions are functional too. Point is they are separate

benthompson	722819377276407810	2016-04-20T16:09:03	binarybits that's what I mean by saying we read it differently. I read it as a problem that needs to be solved, not that it's unsolvable
benthompson	722819159919173632	2016-04-20T16:08:11	binarybits agree. They already did it once

benthompson	722810488422211585	2016-04-20T15:33:44	ezraklein binarybits agree. I agree with the whole post, actually. Been saying same about Singapore

benthompson	722791207634542597	2016-04-20T14:17:07	rafat for sure. My context was others with similar cost to mine going way overboard in my opinion to stop piracy. Counterproductive
benthompson	722788362562592771	2016-04-20T14:05:49	Jakewk rafat sure, and I have a paywall. But I'm also more of a volume play. I respect our needs our different in this case
benthompson	722788132375007232	2016-04-20T14:04:54	rafat but I would look into that world to see best practices. An app could work too, but may not be worth it. Maybe HTML5 app (a la FT)?
benthompson	722787851625041920	2016-04-20T14:03:47	rafat ah, gotchya. Yeah, that definitely changes the calculus. Wall Street firms heavily watermark, not sure what penalties are
benthompson	722786660996395010	2016-04-20T13:59:03	rafat I have a ton of pirates, but I'd rather the folks that pay the bills have the best possible experience
benthompson	722786081716842497	2016-04-20T13:56:45	rafat I think focusing more on pirates than on paying customers is a mistake

benthompson	720646183513788417	2016-04-14T16:13:33	BlairReeves And I think nothing stays secure. So engineer for failure. And, thus, rule out universal keys where all security fails at once
benthompson	720645968907993088	2016-04-14T16:12:42	BlairReeves ok, I won't characterize you then. I think universal keys are categorically different than physical ones‚Ä¶

benthompson	719944605400051712	2016-04-12T17:45:44	What ridiculous about this tweet is I just realized I pronounce it 'JIF'.  
benthompson	719943787129090048	2016-04-12T17:42:29	Facebook exec pronounced GIF wrong. Scandalous.
benthompson	719941261545775104	2016-04-12T17:32:27	Mark Zuckerberg saying everyone will use paid apps for social is the most fanciful thing he's said all day.
benthompson	719940849342099458	2016-04-12T17:30:48	So Zuck, are these social experiences coming to Vive and Playstation VR? Or are you paying a strategy tax?  
benthompson	719937640267558912	2016-04-12T17:18:03	Mark Zuckerberg reads the comments.
benthompson	719934799310237696	2016-04-12T17:06:46	Snark is fun but I'm legitimately shocked how political this speech is by Zuck.

benthompson	719864845617598464	2016-04-12T12:28:48	It really is frustrating to hear Apple go on and on about how they value security and see how carelessly iCloud verification is implemented.
benthompson	719864631410307073	2016-04-12T12:27:57	Why those password pop-ups are so problematic: fantastic vector for phishing, and Apple is conditioning bad habits.

benthompson	719804744110215168	2016-04-12T08:29:58	Everything about this is architected wrong, engineered poorly, with a dash of terrible UI to boot. Rotten to the core.

benthompson	719584083844538368	2016-04-11T17:53:09	Longyuhang service. But why would it be a phone. More likely to be an ear piece. And, as I've said multiple times, that Apple's bear case
benthompson	719582763272122370	2016-04-11T17:47:54	Longyuhang no. I thought the Echo would be good because it was a service, not a hardware product with a GUI
benthompson	719582584301203456	2016-04-11T17:47:11	Longyuhang especially given that the thesis that product strength flows from company strength has been central to my blog from day one

benthompson	718462878727077888	2016-04-08T15:37:53	stevelevine cdbrown91 claychristensen my problem is the contention that it applies to everything. It doesn't. Doesn't mean it's not valid

benthompson	718132732551761920	2016-04-07T17:46:00	dasan yes of course. I was just curious how you got the negative gross margin figure for Tesla
benthompson	718131809045712896	2016-04-07T17:42:20	neilcybart Yeah, it's a real weak point though. I encourage you to get an Echo. It'll open your eyes to Siri's shortcomings
benthompson	718131257297604609	2016-04-07T17:40:08	dasan you're including R&amp;D in that gross margin calculation I presume? Because Apple doesn't...
benthompson	718130793403396096	2016-04-07T17:38:18	neilcybart the flipside, though, is that this is why Apple is eternally bad at cloud services. No company can be both
benthompson	718130690684887040	2016-04-07T17:37:53	neilcybart which is why they shouldn't do hardware (Echo isn't hardware, it's a cloud service entrypoint)
benthompson	718130365697630208	2016-04-07T17:36:36	neilcybart because they are all online services. Requires iterative culture.

benthompson	717998843875332097	2016-04-07T08:53:58	danhocking right, that's how I've read it too. But that seems to contradict what I thought was Verizon exclusivity for mobile
benthompson	717994531078033409	2016-04-07T08:36:50	ProfSteveKeen SF demand is driven by mortgage debt. Riggggght

benthompson	717972188037427200	2016-04-07T07:08:03	AngelLamuno yep
benthompson	717970414329135104	2016-04-07T07:01:00	BenedictEvans but while I grant you points for the excellent literary reference, Kontra beat you in brutality üòÇ  
benthompson	717970039115112448	2016-04-07T06:59:31	BenedictEvans Things are changing regardless. That's the point.
benthompson	717969151583588352	2016-04-07T06:55:59	itomitch jamesallworth actually, I'm pretty sure you wouldn't enjoy it at all :)
benthompson	717968718030999552	2016-04-07T06:54:16	itomitch please read the article starting this thread. ROI is risk adjusted
benthompson	717968481006657536	2016-04-07T06:53:19	gte counternotions yeah, that was jarring haha
benthompson	717968189464846336	2016-04-07T06:52:10	BenedictEvans drahardja pmarca true. Rent control beneficiaries are like homeowners x 100
benthompson	717968045424058368	2016-04-07T06:51:35	hazememry were I a betting man I'd bet a lot of money that absent change SF housing never goes back to early 00's level
benthompson	717967707040129025	2016-04-07T06:50:15	itomitch then you need less restrictions. Luxury is only type with upside to justify the regulatory risk
benthompson	717966683550289920	2016-04-07T06:46:11	Folks fighting to keep SF as it was are arguably guaranteeing the change they resent.
benthompson	717966628940480512	2016-04-07T06:45:58	What is frustrating is that there's a lot of evidence that the outcome of inaction is *more* rich techies as a percentage of population.
benthompson	717965696282406913	2016-04-07T06:42:15	The only certainty is that San Francisco is changing.  Inaction is to decide on a different future just as explicitly as action.
benthompson	717965396049956864	2016-04-07T06:41:04	hazememry 
benthompson	717965089727336448	2016-04-07T06:39:51	BenedictEvans stevesi pmarca in a vacuum sure. Which is why a more systematic approach is necessary.
benthompson	717964521705328641	2016-04-07T06:37:35	stevesi BenedictEvans pmarca El Camino Real should be one long stretch of apartment buildings with a train. A wasteland now
benthompson	717964250103160832	2016-04-07T06:36:31	stevesi BenedictEvans pmarca 100% agree this needs to be part of solution. Lack of coordination amongst multiple cities big problem
benthompson	717963966597582848	2016-04-07T06:35:23	BenedictEvans stevesi pmarca people aren't moving there (or SF) for the nice apartments.
benthompson	717963384784728064	2016-04-07T06:33:04	stevesi BenedictEvans pmarca imagine how much rents would rise without new rentals :)
benthompson	717962660109688832	2016-04-07T06:30:11	BenedictEvans stevesi pmarca The issue is that inaction is killing what people think they are preserving. There is no standing still
benthompson	717962598977658882	2016-04-07T06:29:57	BenedictEvans stevesi pmarca ok, so you have an even more dynamic economy with the same high prices.
benthompson	717961961355350016	2016-04-07T06:27:25	stevesi BenedictEvans pmarca but SF is far past that point. There is overwhelming demand regardless
benthompson	717961392163201026	2016-04-07T06:25:09	edog1203 there's a theory that good governance is correlated with bad winter weather because requires planning/coordination
benthompson	717961018173837312	2016-04-07T06:23:40	BenedictEvans pmarca more cars have negative externalities; more housing has positive ones
benthompson	717960187898757120	2016-04-07T06:20:22	Aelkus awesome reference :)
benthompson	717960119598747648	2016-04-07T06:20:06	edog1203 being 90/10 in favor of doing nothing would be an improvement, much less 50/50
benthompson	717959912341385216	2016-04-07T06:19:16	edog1203 2/ without having to re-legislate the zoning law all over again. What's the point of having zoning in the first place?
benthompson	717959752483930112	2016-04-07T06:18:38	edog1203 no one is talking about putting up skyscrapers. People just want to be able to build a building in accordance with zoning laws (1/
benthompson	717959626126307328	2016-04-07T06:18:08	edog1203 the problem is that "balance must be achieved" sounds good until you realize just how extreme the situation is
benthompson	717959387059367936	2016-04-07T06:17:11	edog1203 heh, no need to apologize :)
benthompson	717958440497205249	2016-04-07T06:13:25	edog1203 it is selfish though, like the immigration debate write large. Everyone was new to the city at some point, for some reason.
benthompson	717956323539685376	2016-04-07T06:05:01	BryantReeves50 jmcduling yep. Huge problem, but SF would be lucky if they could get to the point where that's the biggest issue
benthompson	717955251744026624	2016-04-07T06:00:45	h4emtfr the linked article is a very good overview
benthompson	717954747106394112	2016-04-07T05:58:45	It's striking how pretty much every single person that says the solution to SF's housing is *not* more housing happens to own a house in SF.
benthompson	717953374948171776	2016-04-07T05:53:18	jmcduling it's worse in that the obstacles are so profoundly dumb. HK, for example, has real speculation problems that SF doesn't
benthompson	717953065165332480	2016-04-07T05:52:04	mikeindustries which is what boggles the mind ;)
benthompson	717952560414400516	2016-04-07T05:50:03	It still boggles the mind that this is remotely controversial.   
benthompson	717920287866507265	2016-04-07T03:41:49	Brshkarski they have been for a while now 
benthompson	717919648755245061	2016-04-07T03:39:17	clonezone fair point, but I was thinking a merchant account vs Stripe. PayPal too high level

benthompson	717881636314939392	2016-04-07T01:08:14	MarkSobkowicz it was about branding and loyalty. I didn't say they were money maker like Apple in the slightest and I'm skeptical can scale

benthompson	717736242532593664	2016-04-06T15:30:29	jandawson you have access to your Dropbox folder from within the office apps on iOS

benthompson	717704943897980929	2016-04-06T13:26:07	gdaysiri read the HBS article linked in the article. They describe it
benthompson	717701628040622081	2016-04-06T13:12:57	gdaysiri they're not. That was my point
benthompson	717701375828697088	2016-04-06T13:11:56	mikedariano uh, Ben Thompson at Stratechery :). These are original arguments, as is everything on my site that isn't explicitly cited
benthompson	717676035626508288	2016-04-06T11:31:15	gdaysiri no. Again, disruption has a very specific meaning. It is a widely accepted business theory about a specific kind of innovation
benthompson	717673278010032128	2016-04-06T11:20:17	gdaysiri the articles linked in the piece are a great place to start, esp. the What Christensen Got Wrong one
benthompson	717670600416714753	2016-04-06T11:09:39	DanCapelle singingpeter it's hopefully coming soon. Not here now
benthompson	717647157126242304	2016-04-06T09:36:30	gdaysiri well, it's not. Disruption has a very specific meaning. The broader point is disruption doesn't explain all innovation
benthompson	717569091301552128	2016-04-06T04:26:17	This is quite scary.  
benthompson	717547574756921346	2016-04-06T03:00:47	@KeshikCapital dasan I'm talking about one specific aspect around a brand's halo effects. It does not follow they are exactly the same
benthompson	717547400181600258	2016-04-06T03:00:06	dasan that's fair
benthompson	717547117716176896	2016-04-06T02:58:58	dasan I analyzed the reaction, which was impressive and says something. As you know, I'm not moving in or out of stock in next 6 months

benthompson	714060447213707264	2016-03-27T12:04:11	alex_dennis waltmossberg yes that's reasonable. If that was Walt's point then clearly speaking past each other
benthompson	713926742629617665	2016-03-27T03:12:54	What about the media's failure to prevent this? 
benthompson	714054029974704128	2016-03-27T11:38:41	waltmossberg fair. I'm not sure what measurement unit there is other than sales, but that's definitely what I was referring to
benthompson	714053761635758081	2016-03-27T11:37:37	waltmossberg "good enough" favors Apple now. Meaning, absent a noticeable leap *past* the iPhone, market dynamics won't change
benthompson	714053555808657408	2016-03-27T11:36:48	waltmossberg with you on iPhone software quality. Been saying it longer. But I think we're past the point where high end users are choosing
benthompson	714051759673450496	2016-03-27T11:29:40	waltmossberg and I don't think Apple's lead is thinning, whatever iPhone 7 hardware brings

benthompson	713968518954295297	2016-03-27T05:58:54	jeromey won't make a difference relative to Apple. May help them gain more android share though
benthompson	713968247561854976	2016-03-27T05:57:49	alexismadrigal mgsiegler rsarver what keeps you on Instagram? It's telling that people who claim to hate Facebook still use Facebook
benthompson	713968112056475648	2016-03-27T05:57:17	alexismadrigal mgsiegler rsarver sure, but then which network loses out if snapchat takes outsized attention?

benthompson	713963469347794944	2016-03-27T05:38:50	Folks think hardware is hard because you need a new design every year. Actually, that's why it's easier to perfect than software.

benthompson	713960294444179456	2016-03-27T05:26:13	The tech pundit fallacy: that software is easier to get right than is hardware.  (I think the iPhone will be fine)

benthompson	712932373352960000	2016-03-24T09:21:38	gonglei89 neilcybart mobile_reach I'm pretty confident at this point the primary consideration was replacing the 5; if sold well bonus

benthompson	712931277192749057	2016-03-24T09:17:16	iamsgr007 I was under the impression the 6S launched in India in October, which was five months ago. Didn't realize already a year
benthompson	712930796445761536	2016-03-24T09:15:22	DeepakKodela fortunately for Apple the business is not measured at a single point in time
benthompson	712930201542467584	2016-03-24T09:13:00	DeepakKodela they're not the same price. The 6S is 62,500.  Oh, I'm sorry, are you still comparing apples to oranges?
benthompson	712930020155637761	2016-03-24T09:12:17	viranchdamani mobile_reach neilcybart why not?
benthompson	712929982343942144	2016-03-24T09:12:08	nicoffx maybe. Been watching
benthompson	712929904107634688	2016-03-24T09:11:49	JaveedAhmedM venkatananth agree. Maybe even 25
benthompson	712929811799351296	2016-03-24T09:11:27	TitansDumble so you're saying the 6S price is down by that much because another higher end phone was launched? Oh wait, there wasn't
benthompson	712929644387827712	2016-03-24T09:10:47	joy014 once it launches is a single point in time. Let's see what it is in 4 months or so
benthompson	712929458693476352	2016-03-24T09:10:03	DeepakKodela venkatananth so?
benthompson	712929245811630081	2016-03-24T09:09:12	TitansDumble what do you think the SE will cost in 6 months?
benthompson	712929110956199936	2016-03-24T09:08:40	viranchdamani mobile_reach neilcybart and you continue to compare list price to market price which is what started this conversation
benthompson	712928977229209600	2016-03-24T09:08:08	neilcybart mobile_reach I'm happy to agree to disagree then.
benthompson	712928031426363394	2016-03-24T09:04:22	neilcybart mobile_reach well, now you're saying it's an evolution, which is a change :)
benthompson	712927367971344384	2016-03-24T09:01:44	neilcybart mobile_reach completely disagree. It is a significant shift in strategy
benthompson	712927201335906306	2016-03-24T09:01:05	benthompson neilcybart mobile_reach @ansarikashif7It and I feel most of the analysis way too US centric.   But hey, I was wrong about 5C
benthompson	712927090975371264	2016-03-24T09:00:38	neilcybart mobile_reach @ansarikashif7It Apple is pricing it at the exact same ratio they price their other phones. I think you're wrong
benthompson	712927003842846721	2016-03-24T09:00:17	I made my SE argument in detail yesterday:   If not member think about implications here: 
benthompson	712926680810184704	2016-03-24T08:59:00	viranchdamani mobile_reach ansarikashif7 neilcybart and you don't think a better phone at an even lower price wouldn't do better?
benthompson	712926382905552896	2016-03-24T08:57:49	neilcybart mobile_reach ansarikashif7 if it were targeted at existing iPhone customers it would cost $450, not $400
benthompson	712926033373036544	2016-03-24T08:56:26	mobile_reach ansarikashif7 neilcybart it is wrong to consider this a low end phone targeted at price conscious customers
benthompson	712924609847365632	2016-03-24T08:50:47	Also, how is someone buying a more expensive phone a bad thing for Apple? This whole brouhaha is bizarre.
benthompson	712924466423193600	2016-03-24T08:50:12	viranchdamani someone buying a 6 instead of an SE is good for Apple
benthompson	712923631769280512	2016-03-24T08:46:53	HarshilShah1910 yeah, but it seems clear it's set that high with the assumption of massive discounts
benthompson	712923372368314373	2016-03-24T08:45:52	direstraits_ doh!
benthompson	712923202972958720	2016-03-24T08:45:11	This insistence on comparing list price to market price has been illuminating when it comes to identifying lazy thinking though.
benthompson	712922737241620481	2016-03-24T08:43:20	The equivalent of the 6S at Rs. 40,000 is the SE at Rs. 24,600.  You don't think a Rs. 24,600 iPhone with top specs won't sell?
benthompson	712922275280982016	2016-03-24T08:41:30	I explained this in the last footnote two days ago:   Baffled people insist on comparing apples-to-oranges here.
benthompson	712922050730528768	2016-03-24T08:40:37	In India:  The 6S is listed at Rs. 62,500, but available at Rs. 40,000.  The SE is listed at Rs. 39,000. Obvious it'll be available for less
benthompson	712921553458044928	2016-03-24T08:38:38	shahhirenp anshublog BenedictEvans this is sloppy thinking.  The 6S is listed at 62,500. Obviously SE will be available for much less.

benthompson	709579241902354432	2016-03-15T03:17:29	elkmovie fair point. Short-term is key. But customer acquisition is hard
benthompson	709578370963546112	2016-03-15T03:14:01	elkmovie I think you'd agree that incurring any ongoing cost for customers you'll only get money from once isn't wise
benthompson	709578261290876928	2016-03-15T03:13:35	elkmovie got it. We're on the same page -- you have to have a way to make recurring revenue off of your customers
benthompson	709577131609567232	2016-03-15T03:09:06	elkmovie right. But you were talking about "fixed price apps with a cloud component"
benthompson	709575566932848641	2016-03-15T03:02:53	elkmovie the point of a moat is to keep customers so you can keep getting money from them. Upfront purchase incentive is to ditch customers

benthompson	705044784746921984	2016-03-02T14:59:10	MikeIsaac yep. In such cases I think big companies are better off buying than mimicking

benthompson	692372735893213184	2016-01-27T15:44:58	I don't know that I agree completely, but I am increasingly attracted to the idea of a reboot.   Related: 
benthompson	692372125659824128	2016-01-27T15:42:33	"Twitter NT"  It's by davewiner, which means you should read it.  
benthompson	692371527396753408	2016-01-27T15:40:10	Facebook is screwing with the 'Like'    Meanwhile, @-mentions still count against the 140 character limit.
benthompson	692367681199144962	2016-01-27T15:24:53	I talked to fmanjoo for his column:   And I made the Daily Update he linked free in part: 
benthompson	692357455142096897	2016-01-27T14:44:15	davewiner AdamSinger of which 15% are consumed by usernames! After ten years!
benthompson	692357196961714176	2016-01-27T14:43:13	AdamSinger BlairReeves no I'm not. I'm talking about the users Twitter needs to be a viable business.
benthompson	692356699240341504	2016-01-27T14:41:15	davewiner AdamSinger agree, but news has the same problem: valuable but worthless
benthompson	692356542469947393	2016-01-27T14:40:37	AdamSinger I think you have an incomplete understanding of Facebook in 2016
benthompson	692356328585457664	2016-01-27T14:39:46	AdamSinger BlairReeves I'm capable of deciding whether or not Twitter and FB should be compared or not. "It's not your fault..."
benthompson	692355966797414400	2016-01-27T14:38:20	AdamSinger they can both exist but Twitter won't be at a scale to support their business model.
benthompson	692355873897721856	2016-01-27T14:37:58	AdamSinger but the users Twitter needs are using Facebook for Twitter's job. Winning against non consumption far easier
benthompson	692354536854331393	2016-01-27T14:32:39	AdamSinger putting aside the condescension, why was it terrible? Are there infinite people with infinite attention?

benthompson	692173356221751296	2016-01-27T02:32:42	dasan yep, I think you were right. I'm not sure what I was thinking because I have actually been very consistently bearish
benthompson	692172974355521538	2016-01-27T02:31:11	dasan true, and it also helps prevent abuse I think. But I was writing first and foremost about the user number problem, not monetization

benthompson	691824692781539328	2016-01-26T03:27:14	I presume the Twitter ad/no-ad is based on verification. benthompson has no ads, notechben has lots of ads.

benthompson	691652582666670080	2016-01-25T16:03:20	ntaylor963 good summary. Only thing I'd add is that zero dist cost shifted profit center, while zero tran costs made winner-take-all poss
