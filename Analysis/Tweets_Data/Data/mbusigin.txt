mbusigin	715085289258098688	2016-03-30T07:56:33	archibald_rust but a broader conclusion that it's driving the bus is probably wrong.
mbusigin	715085265249894400	2016-03-30T07:56:27	archibald_rust It brings up some interesting points about interest expenditure's role in consumer prices;
mbusigin	715084150768857088	2016-03-30T07:52:01	archibald_rust I therefore reject the Money as Veblan Good thesis, as well as broad neo-Fisherism conclusions.
mbusigin	715083453801316352	2016-03-30T07:49:15	archibald_rust profplum99 actually explained a lot of this to me a while ago
mbusigin	715083269784645639	2016-03-30T07:48:31	archibald_rust So what you're  observing is reaction function error from a feedback loop in the benchmark, most pronounced at high rates
mbusigin	715081934880243713	2016-03-30T07:43:13	archibald_rust This is actually an error in reaction function that the Fed made during Volker error (and contributed to index change).
mbusigin	715081581061414912	2016-03-30T07:41:49	archibald_rust When interest rates are really high (late 70s, 80s), jacks up shelter costs, correlation will be high. Opposite when low.
mbusigin	715080959876587520	2016-03-30T07:39:21	archibald_rust Okay, I think I understand the phenomenon you're observing now.
mbusigin	714986989641207808	2016-03-30T01:25:56	archibald_rust I really don't see the need for the Fed's forecast to be perfect (it's awful); explain that to me?
mbusigin	714986851535339520	2016-03-30T01:25:23	archibald_rust As for money being veblan good, causation is intuitively backwards; higher monetary velocity = higher demand for money
mbusigin	714986317231308800	2016-03-30T01:23:16	archibald_rust Temporal order of correlation is solved for by the IRF.
mbusigin	714968641712877568	2016-03-30T00:13:02	archibald_rust I'll give the piece a full read, though.
mbusigin	714968464922951680	2016-03-30T00:12:20	archibald_rust I did; I do. But I reject the premise, mostly, on account of Friedman's Thermostat.
mbusigin	714968308840341504	2016-03-30T00:11:42	archibald_rust You going neo-fisher on me?
mbusigin	714922359728316417	2016-03-29T21:09:07	BobBrinker Clearly that's their thinking; but history shows that their policy mistakes have resulted from this scenario exactly.
mbusigin	714921248845864961	2016-03-29T21:04:42	BobBrinker Justification for emergency policy is gone. 1-1.5% Fed Funds will still be easy monetary policy.
mbusigin	714921145561178112	2016-03-29T21:04:18	BobBrinker Last 3 months Core PCE Index = 2%. Y/Y, accelerating rapidly towards 2%. 
mbusigin	714919834740465664	2016-03-29T20:59:05	BobBrinker And the reason: the output gap is not consistent with these rates. 
mbusigin	714919304198819840	2016-03-29T20:56:59	BobBrinker Real PCE does not. But, fine: use the output gap as your explanation. But that's not what's happening. 
mbusigin	714917715367079937	2016-03-29T20:50:40	China, the USD, and the rest of the world is already baked into the price index cake. So youre double+ weighting it by using those as inputs
mbusigin	714917519438528512	2016-03-29T20:49:53	This is the stuff of Fed policy errors. 
mbusigin	713804208860999680	2016-03-26T19:05:59	The degree to which K's value is a function of its relationship to L is defined by its accumulation of fixed capital's ratio to A/D.
mbusigin	713792577800183808	2016-03-26T18:19:46	elprocurador And there is some alpha in this analysis, because the impact of foreign shocks are overestimated here.
mbusigin	713791893302325248	2016-03-26T18:17:03	elprocurador Yup.
mbusigin	713791735965618176	2016-03-26T18:16:26	elprocurador I have enough difficulty establishing reasonable priors on the US versions of those...
mbusigin	713791604348338176	2016-03-26T18:15:54	elprocurador That's why I honestly don't even look at ex-US -- it's too complicated, too many variables, too unstable for me to understand.
mbusigin	713791466116669441	2016-03-26T18:15:21	elprocurador Only can draw conclusions on how institutional/political/societal choices may impact Q, V, M and P.
mbusigin	713791382456938496	2016-03-26T18:15:01	elprocurador Right, well, our explanation is forced to view institutions, politics and societal behaviour as exogenous.
mbusigin	713790377141149696	2016-03-26T18:11:02	elprocurador but it's just not the dominant impulse in most cases.
mbusigin	713790339513982976	2016-03-26T18:10:53	elprocurador All of these things are terrible for growing A/S, and, as a result, Q. P is flexible, and the result is inevitable. M, too,
mbusigin	713789983849586689	2016-03-26T18:09:28	elprocurador Sure, who will make big, expensive, risky capex when you have questionable rule of law?
mbusigin	713788744898318336	2016-03-26T18:04:32	elprocurador Argentina I have less expertise in, but suspect foreign supply of goods (which contribute to A/S) basically turned off w/ CA.
mbusigin	713788529982222336	2016-03-26T18:03:41	elprocurador Weimar saw massive portions of their A/S appropriated and exported for "free" via treaties. (See: Keynes's Price of Peace).
mbusigin	713788366014255104	2016-03-26T18:03:02	elprocurador Take the Soviet Union collapse: it was institutional, cultural, social. Factories closed bc no1 could figure out who was boss.
mbusigin	713788178898018304	2016-03-26T18:02:18	elprocurador Every one that I've explored is different.
mbusigin	713787348044132352	2016-03-26T17:58:59	elprocurador  Look at these 4 hyperinflations: in each case, P moved before M.
mbusigin	713785752023351298	2016-03-26T17:52:39	elprocurador aggregate supply
mbusigin	713785709409280000	2016-03-26T17:52:29	"Financialization of the economy" is *mostly* another way of saying that the private sector went through a massive liability swap.
mbusigin	713785073313648640	2016-03-26T17:49:57	When equity is converted into debt, M rises, but Q's the same, and V just declines a little through numerator. P stays the same.
mbusigin	713782773086044160	2016-03-26T17:40:49	Credit growth is not marginal economic activity. Rather, it represents capital structure rebalancing. Equity liability turning into debt.
mbusigin	713782554235641857	2016-03-26T17:39:57	If yearly private credit growth is so damned large relative to NGDP, how can policy instrumentation be so blunt? 
mbusigin	713780891215114240	2016-03-26T17:33:20	Theo_Clifford And that there is no fine tuned control over M, let alone P. It takes policy shocks, not adjustments, to do it.
mbusigin	713780750169071617	2016-03-26T17:32:46	Theo_Clifford That's not to say that the Fed *couldn't* exercise the dominant influence on M... my point is that has to try really hard.
mbusigin	713780570195681281	2016-03-26T17:32:03	Theo_Clifford and, again, a) Fed only is one impulse on M  and  b) M explains less than V on P
mbusigin	713780285901512705	2016-03-26T17:30:56	Theo_Clifford M expands as a result. You'll see that P moves before M in almost every hyperinflation since Weimar.
mbusigin	713780100873994240	2016-03-26T17:30:12	Theo_Clifford Actually, there's good evidence that M can very much be controlled by P. Most hyperinflations start with A/S crises.
mbusigin	713777139020140544	2016-03-26T17:18:25	bozwood that sounds expensive
mbusigin	713776976981581824	2016-03-26T17:17:47	Theo_Clifford V empirically explains way more of P than M. And the Fed doesn't even control M. Only impulses on part of it.
mbusigin	713775555347423233	2016-03-26T17:12:08	Theo_Clifford P is a function of M, V and Q. The Fed does exercise impulses on each, but the dominant impulse? Not usually.
mbusigin	713775067897995264	2016-03-26T17:10:12	Theo_Clifford I think the answer is practically everything and everyone.
mbusigin	713773757429596161	2016-03-26T17:04:59	Theo_Clifford Monetary policy shouldn't be impacting anything in the long run, unless it's really screwed up the short run.
mbusigin	713773365757153283	2016-03-26T17:03:26	Theo_Clifford So fluctuations in demand punk the flexible prices.... which are explicitly not targeted.
mbusigin	713773264531759104	2016-03-26T17:03:02	Theo_Clifford Easy: because core prices are sticky.

mbusigin	713772609301778432	2016-03-26T17:00:25	TimDuy Totally. Again, I'm not resharing this bc of his policy conclusions, but bc it's worth discussing price indexes to target.
mbusigin	713772011575779328	2016-03-26T16:58:03	(economy, inflation) once patient walks out of the hospital (crisis is over).
mbusigin	713771999462604800	2016-03-26T16:58:00	The Fed is a lot like modern medicine: they were fantastic in ER (financial crisis), but they have far less control over health
mbusigin	713771170131288064	2016-03-26T16:54:42	The fact is, what the Fed precisely takes responsibility for, and how they take responsibility for it, is really quite opaque.
mbusigin	713770945169793025	2016-03-26T16:53:49	I'm not relinking to piece (I actually linked to it at the time of publication originally) bc it was right, but bc of nuanced argumentation
mbusigin	713770395913027584	2016-03-26T16:51:38	And, boy, do Bullard's conclusions from that 2011 piece not hold up to 2016 light: 
mbusigin	713768915634102272	2016-03-26T16:45:45	And the Fed still doesn't have much control over it. Core is largely exogenous to monetary policy, because it's aggregate S/D curves based.
mbusigin	713768718447325186	2016-03-26T16:44:58	Sticky IS core.
mbusigin	713768697417113600	2016-03-26T16:44:53	In particular, Bullard's long piece in 2011, The Core Is Rotten:  thinking largely right, but his conclusions wrong
mbusigin	713768199867777024	2016-03-26T16:42:54	 Working through this has made me far more sympathetic to some regional Fed presidents than I have been in the past.

mbusigin	712116882673967106	2016-03-22T03:21:09	Which makes it highish, yeah, but at such low cost of money, and with large equity cushion, noooot really that high.
mbusigin	712116484143759360	2016-03-22T03:19:34	I'm definitely inclined to use historical cost and/or book value as an anchor here, as a consequence.
mbusigin	712116219290263552	2016-03-22T03:18:31	So, unsurprisingly, credit relative to market value is actually very low (compared to book, or historical cost): 
mbusigin	712115466223886336	2016-03-22T03:15:32	And it's fair to say, of course, that the leverage could be under-stated as % of market value, as its expansion has increased asset value.
mbusigin	712115272346419200	2016-03-22T03:14:46	It's a little higher relative to historical cost:

mbusigin	711606869320667137	2016-03-20T17:34:33	And, now, we end up with a silly target that the Fed now has cold feet over (explicit: 2%  implicit: higher), so they search hard for reason
mbusigin	711606631260397568	2016-03-20T17:33:36	But if CB actually doesn't have that fine grain a control over inflation to begin with, that doesn't follow.
mbusigin	711606468852752384	2016-03-20T17:32:57	Best argument may be ostensible predictability we lend to capital allocators, and that should reduce risk premiums, thus inc real investment
mbusigin	711606173003345921	2016-03-20T17:31:47	would have led to better outcomes (higher real outputs).
mbusigin	711606160080642048	2016-03-20T17:31:44	There is actually precious little evidence of this at all. And negative evidence that sticking to 2% during, say, Reagan era,

mbusigin	711605702373064704	2016-03-20T17:29:55	Yes, there are the occasional tail events where run-away psychology leads to price/wage spirals... but it's just that: tail events.
mbusigin	711605105821405185	2016-03-20T17:27:32	It also leads to another, perhaps more important assertion: that prices auto equilibrate far more than assumed. Cure for high prices is...
mbusigin	711604125063110656	2016-03-20T17:23:39	But the evidence seems to indicate the Fed's narrow band of control lies in how much flexible/sticky substitution is permitted.
mbusigin	711603862851944456	2016-03-20T17:22:36	Of course, you probably don't need vector autoregression and impulse response function analyses to conclude that (but I do).
mbusigin	711603110557384704	2016-03-20T17:19:37	I've concluded that CB control over inflation is a substantially blunter instrument than virtually anyone thinks: 
mbusigin	711598840869220354	2016-03-20T17:02:39	This rates-growth relationship works using nominal 10s and nominal GDP as well:

mbusigin	711561447441039360	2016-03-20T14:34:03	I've learnt more about inflation by staring at and pondering this chart than anything else.

mbusigin	711218147127328768	2016-03-19T15:49:54	JustinMorasch I rather think the US economy has become less financialized over that sample.
mbusigin	711202655318704128	2016-03-19T14:48:21	The output gap sure knows no short or intermediate term equilibrium. 
mbusigin	711195912404647937	2016-03-19T14:21:33	Joecool2005 And, of course, shifting discount rates displace allocations... but I think both of these stories occur at higher LERP/lower RR
mbusigin	711195589636182016	2016-03-19T14:20:16	Joecool2005 So, I don't really like equities here just because money is easy. But some +ve impulses for sure as high LERPs incent buybacks.
mbusigin	711195285226127361	2016-03-19T14:19:04	Joecool2005 Second, Real Rates run inverse LERP (EY - Baa), so lower real rates = higher LERP, and, again, ceteris paribus, lower eq prices
mbusigin	711194940802408449	2016-03-19T14:17:41	Joecool2005 The mechanism is that ERP (via EY - 10s) is actually very positively correlated with significant beta to the curve.
mbusigin	711194628788244481	2016-03-19T14:16:27	Joecool2005 First of all, steeper curve actually typically means lower equities, ceteris paribus: 
mbusigin	711194191750107136	2016-03-19T14:14:43	It implies that output gap neutral policy has real rates around -1%.
mbusigin	711194110179319808	2016-03-19T14:14:23	These series are far more similar than I would have thought:

mbusigin	709079768180899840	2016-03-13T18:12:45	...also partly driven by the government treating cryptography as a weapon, which of course limits the domestic development/productisation..
mbusigin	709079577885339648	2016-03-13T18:12:00	Part of that is because productisation has been poor, making good crypto &amp; good crypto practice inaccessible to most users....
mbusigin	709079430438719488	2016-03-13T18:11:24	Don't get me wrong - encryption (which includes digital signatures, which is all block chain really is) severely underutilized today.

mbusigin	698954650599481344	2016-02-14T19:39:09	Prezntval So, there is not so much a downward impulse, but the upward impulses ex-oil probably sum to 1.5-2% right now.
mbusigin	698954501768798208	2016-02-14T19:38:33	Prezntval It looks to me like the equilibrium rate of Real PCE growth is probably ~1.5%. Maybe it's a bit higher now.
mbusigin	698944291431968768	2016-02-14T18:57:59	netbacker So ironic, given that a trade deficit is taking from foreigners and giving to domestic consumers.

mbusigin	698907227835518980	2016-02-14T16:30:42	Prezntval If I didn't change my mind after I found my own analytical errors, I'd be in a lot of trouble. ;-)
mbusigin	698907066585501697	2016-02-14T16:30:04	Prezntval Your analytical flaw is ignoring base effect, same time as ignoring the fact that peak RPCE yy coincided with peak oil yy decline
mbusigin	698906713991352320	2016-02-14T16:28:40	Prezntval Nah, you were wrong, and I was wrong to agree with you. The numbers are very clear that it was a boon.
mbusigin	698906370779824129	2016-02-14T16:27:18	Prezntval I thought the savings rate bump meant something that it didn't.
mbusigin	698906026368700416	2016-02-14T16:25:56	Prezntval Without the continuation in oil decline, Real PCE growth would have sank even farther.
mbusigin	698905916784189440	2016-02-14T16:25:30	Prezntval The slowdown in y/y is *base effect* -- i.e. being based on the sizeable gains from oil decline when it was 5% of spending vs 2.5
mbusigin	698905814816440322	2016-02-14T16:25:05	Prezntval Your analysis has a big base effect error. That simple. It was a sizeable real consumption boon.
mbusigin	698900958034706432	2016-02-14T16:05:48	Prezntval The effect fades with base effect. $4-2 is a much bigger deal than $2-1, because the former starts at 5% of PCE, vs 2.5%.
mbusigin	698900372216266753	2016-02-14T16:03:28	Prezntval Real consumption accelerated with the oil decline. Then it faded it a bit. Them's the facts. Consumers spent the energy dividend.
mbusigin	698900086131191808	2016-02-14T16:02:20	Prezntval Sure. Real PCE was reaccelerating before oil crash. Then it accelerated to its peak growth rate at the peak decline rate of oil.
mbusigin	698897806271111172	2016-02-14T15:53:16	Prezntval No - but real consumption would not be higher without oil crash. RGDP held back by cheap imports, *real* trade deficit widening.
mbusigin	698897567606837249	2016-02-14T15:52:19	Prezntval Probably partly because of some minor negative feedback, combined with base effect (gasoline expenditures were smaller fraction)
mbusigin	698897406281256960	2016-02-14T15:51:41	Prezntval No. By your own chart, reals accelerated into the oil crash. Reals *peaked* at *depth* of oil decline %-y/y. Then it faded.

mbusigin	698725041693925376	2016-02-14T04:26:46	Solomon_Slate I did a lot of thinking on this subject today.
mbusigin	698720205225267200	2016-02-14T04:07:33	This is directly observable by the nominal trade balance treading water, while the real trade balance widens ($185B) 
mbusigin	698719648955699200	2016-02-14T04:05:20	File this one under MacroIsHard.
mbusigin	698719521943789568	2016-02-14T04:04:50	So, in a way consumers did "save the energy dividend", but they really "saved the real net import" dividend. *And* spent it.
mbusigin	698719085161541632	2016-02-14T04:03:06	Thus, savings rate merely net balance between macro sectors; Energy dividend only impacted it so much as pricing power flowed to consumers.
mbusigin	698718690645274624	2016-02-14T04:01:32	Assuming no change in pricing power between macro sectors, the deposit still ends up in household sector - even after they have spent it.
mbusigin	698718670533562368	2016-02-14T04:01:27	That is actually easily explainable:
mbusigin	698718490144993282	2016-02-14T04:00:44	This is indirect observation of the oil dividend. But what of the increase in the personal savings rate?

mbusigin	698718155452084224	2016-02-14T03:59:24	I've concluded that I was thinking about the "households saving the energy dividend" wrong the whole time. Of course they spent it.

mbusigin	698545255776440323	2016-02-13T16:32:21	Solomon_Slate HH savings rate is the net position of (relatively inelastic) household consumption vs corporate, public &amp; foreign sectors.
mbusigin	698545124532469760	2016-02-13T16:31:50	Solomon_Slate Very little explainable to change in preferences (maybe +/- 1.5% throughout whole series), but rather that
mbusigin	698544977954082816	2016-02-13T16:31:15	Solomon_Slate What you're looking at is strong evidence that the savings rate is not the dog, but the tail of macro sectoral balances.
mbusigin	698544381335363584	2016-02-13T16:28:53	Solomon_Slate There we go  
mbusigin	698543187573473281	2016-02-13T16:24:08	Solomon_Slate What you're observing is principally the reduction of the trade deficit, which has flowed to both profits and HH savings.

mbusigin	698542349106946048	2016-02-13T16:20:48	Solomon_Slate But the biggest cause, IMO, is the view of permanence of the energy dividend.

mbusigin	698541804191424513	2016-02-13T16:18:39	Solomon_Slate First observation is that the shift in savings rate actually isn't that historically significant. 
mbusigin	698541187955847169	2016-02-13T16:16:12	JimThorall Low *inflation* certainly promotes savings. Low interest rates do not. High *real interest rates* do.
mbusigin	698540698732228613	2016-02-13T16:14:15	Solomon_Slate Not useful analysis for me. What matters is distribution of MPC across energy dividend receivers.

mbusigin	695744207835815940	2016-02-05T23:02:00	Now, we have an extraordinarily easy Fed. This is one of the most unique economic situations in post-WWII history.
mbusigin	695743735217418240	2016-02-05T23:00:07	It has been exceedingly rare for ULC to eclipse consumer prices. And it generally ends in recession, because the Fed murders the economy.

mbusigin	695736389854490624	2016-02-05T22:30:56	Next time someone blames the "earnings recession" on the USD, point them to this: 
mbusigin	695718591254102017	2016-02-05T21:20:12	DevinAction36 Minimum wage hikes occur every year in January. The seasonal adjustment already takes that into account.
mbusigin	695668822171381761	2016-02-05T18:02:26	lizzie363 Rather, low oil prices likely mean min wage will be on hold for a long time, probably deep into next cycle.
mbusigin	695668636900597760	2016-02-05T18:01:42	lizzie363 Causation is mostly the other way around, I think. High oil = lots of investment = rising wage pressure.
mbusigin	695668029015912448	2016-02-05T17:59:17	lizzie363 And, one day, when the cycle returns, the pendulum will once again swing in favour of employers while the wage pressure lags..
mbusigin	695667855883378689	2016-02-05T17:58:36	lizzie363 Totally unsurprising given where you are in the economic cycle. But broadly and on avg?  Not how it works.
mbusigin	695667607077265408	2016-02-05T17:57:37	lizzie363 So 2016 Alberta minimum wage is basically set on 2013-2014 oil.
mbusigin	695667405159337984	2016-02-05T17:56:48	lizzie363 They'd be contracting employment either way. Wages lag the cycle by a year or two, and minwage lags by another year or two.
mbusigin	695659829558435840	2016-02-05T17:26:42	lizzie363 ..and no-one will dispute that Alberta was in a tight labour market until pretty recently.
mbusigin	695659518143889408	2016-02-05T17:25:28	lizzie363 Of course: it's a lagging indicator of broader wages, and wages themselves are a lagging economic indicator.
mbusigin	695658250805649408	2016-02-05T17:20:26	AlanTonelson Finally, political will for minimum wage hikes only exists in a tight labour market. Meaning minwage hikes are part cyclical.
mbusigin	695657919166205956	2016-02-05T17:19:07	AlanTonelson Minimum wage workers also are not that statistically significant a group to begin with - about 2.4% &lt;= minwage.

mbusigin	690939476680560640	2016-01-23T16:49:42	Prezntval Funny, but their judgment is far more reliable because it's ex-post rather than a forecast.
mbusigin	690931836579647489	2016-01-23T16:19:21	Prezntval Whatever. I trust NBER. The risk of over or under-specifying is greater than their judgment error IMO.
mbusigin	690928479530016769	2016-01-23T16:06:01	Prezntval Mish and ECRI can continue screaming into a vacuum. NBER doesn't need to change anything.
mbusigin	690922987973910528	2016-01-23T15:44:11	Prezntval Shit, most war economies, for that point.

mbusigin	690922031752318977	2016-01-23T15:40:23	Prezntval No. Why would any country want to work more to consume less? The in extremis example would be a forced labour economy.
mbusigin	690921752298414080	2016-01-23T15:39:17	Prezntval The point is that this condition tends to precede broader GDP declines.
mbusigin	690921656659873792	2016-01-23T15:38:54	Prezntval No, that's a terrible definition of recession. That's why NBER is useful as a non-mechanical description.
mbusigin	690920487799635968	2016-01-23T15:34:15	Prezntval At the end of the day, people generally don't like to work or invest without getting to consume to proceeds.
mbusigin	690920293112627201	2016-01-23T15:33:29	Prezntval There are *plenty* of examples. Why overspecify at "for more than 1 qtr"? Yes, this usually doesn't last very long.
mbusigin	690917421188825088	2016-01-23T15:22:04	Prezntval Nuance, bitches!
mbusigin	690917250266710017	2016-01-23T15:21:23	Prezntval Other countries, which are in recession, are supplying us goods/svcs to consume - impoverishing themselves. We say: thanks!
mbusigin	690917077046185984	2016-01-23T15:20:42	Prezntval So we actually have weak GDP, but a strong domestic final demand and consumption.
mbusigin	690916967839039488	2016-01-23T15:20:16	Prezntval Easy: right now is almost exactly the opposite of that hypothetical scenario.  Final Demand v. strong
mbusigin	690916388593123328	2016-01-23T15:17:58	Prezntval In this scenario, GDP may be higher, but we're actually effectively more impoverished domestically. That's a recession.
mbusigin	690916200927330304	2016-01-23T15:17:13	Prezntval For example, we can have a domestic consumption contraction with positive GDP as long as exports grow faster.
mbusigin	690916075266052096	2016-01-23T15:16:43	Prezntval I completely agree with his statement that "A recession is not a statistic of GDP. It's a process." But basically nothing else.

mbusigin	690892911236509696	2016-01-23T13:44:40	Contrary to widely held belief, NBER dating of recessions not mechanical at all. In fact, it's quite discretionary.

mbusigin	686548388901482496	2016-01-11T14:01:06	DavidSchawel but the biggest difference is probably in goalie equipment and team systems. Gretz would have a much lower shooting % in '15.
mbusigin	686548221519355907	2016-01-11T14:00:26	DavidSchawel Of course, you also have to think that that bumper crop in offensive talent also helped push the scoring...
