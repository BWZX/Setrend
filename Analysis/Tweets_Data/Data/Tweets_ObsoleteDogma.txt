ObsoleteDogma	704780768745295874	2016-03-01T21:30:04	14. So the GOP elite is shocked, shocked at how ugly the base is now that that hate isn’t being used to cut taxes for the rich.
ObsoleteDogma	704780389089452032	2016-03-01T21:28:33	13. But most GOP voters don’t care about tax cuts for the rich. They just care about nationalism. And that’s what Trump is giving them.
ObsoleteDogma	704780006174683136	2016-03-01T21:27:02	12. The GOP elite has told their voters to hate these people *just as long as it was in the service of tax cuts for the rich*.
ObsoleteDogma	704779880836304897	2016-03-01T21:26:32	11. That means hating blacks, gays, Hispanics, Muslims—all of them. And the GOP elite has no one to blame but themselves.
ObsoleteDogma	704779627991068674	2016-03-01T21:25:32	10. GOP nationalism is about taking care of the white working class—protecting Social Security, Medicare, and vets—and hating others.
ObsoleteDogma	704779428514177026	2016-03-01T21:24:44	9. Now the GOP elites are finding out that more of their voters prefer nationalism to conservatism—and it’s ugly.
ObsoleteDogma	704778884131241984	2016-03-01T21:22:34	8. The Tea Party was really the idea that Obama was taking from people who deserved help—working class whites—&amp; giving to the undeserving
ObsoleteDogma	704778372837203968	2016-03-01T21:20:32	6. The Tea Party was supposed to be limited spending! First principles! But it was also about birtherism &amp; death panels &amp; other lies.
ObsoleteDogma	704778189965541377	2016-03-01T21:19:49	5. Once they lost power, the GOP elites tried to block Obama by playing up nationalism but convinced themselves it was about conservatism
ObsoleteDogma	704777422571487233	2016-03-01T21:16:46	4. The GOP elite failed in every conceivable way: Iraq, Katrina, the financial crisis. Not to mention that trickle down didn’t trickle down.
ObsoleteDogma	704777010107830272	2016-03-01T21:15:07	3. That was great for the GOP elite while it lasted. But then the George W. Bush administration happened.
ObsoleteDogma	704776796122775552	2016-03-01T21:14:16	2. That was “What’s the matter with Kansas”. The GOP base would vote against their economic self-interests for cultural reasons.
ObsoleteDogma	704776375790649344	2016-03-01T21:12:36	1. The GOP was tied together by two ideas: nationalism &amp; conservatism. Elites used the first to achieve the second.
