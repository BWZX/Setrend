AnnCoulter	698719252094693377	2016-02-14T04:03:45	Biggest loser tonight: the RNC. Stacked the audience. Unruly crowd. Weak moderators. And the RNC may get its just reward: Trump.
AnnCoulter	698719397230350336	2016-02-14T04:04:20	But only Trump gets attacked for ever changing his mind on anything.  At least he admits when he's changed his mind. 
AnnCoulter	698714628969381890	2016-02-14T03:45:23	Even on an "off" night Trump takes up so much oxygen that he makes it very hard for anyone else to look even somewhat presidential.

AnnCoulter	698712689573523456	2016-02-14T03:37:41	Trump: “I don’t frankly have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you, this country doesn’t have time either.”
AnnCoulter	698712503027683337	2016-02-14T03:36:56	At least Trump's answer on political correctness didn't get a lot of attention or anything -

AnnCoulter	698710466307219457	2016-02-14T03:28:51	Has Trump called anyone else a liar?  He calls them funny names, he doesn't call them liars (other than Cruz - because he's a liar).
AnnCoulter	698709807893708801	2016-02-14T03:26:14	It can't be said often enough.  This audience is abominable.

AnnCoulter	698706205963898880	2016-02-14T03:11:55	This audience is insufferable. RNC has got to be bulldozed.
AnnCoulter	698706050116149248	2016-02-14T03:11:18	Trump is right: There is NO WAY there would have been a single question about immigration in these debates without Trump.
AnnCoulter	698690255637999616	2016-02-14T02:08:32	We know from the initial cheers whom the audience (e.g. donors) is stacked with (Rubio/Cruz backers, with a bit of Jeb). Not Trump

AnnCoulter	698705183996510209	2016-02-14T03:07:51	CBS has got to throw out the jackass cheering squad.  It may boost little Mario's ego during the debate, but it didn't help Rand Paul.
AnnCoulter	698698914875072512	2016-02-14T02:42:57	Before this campaign is over we may have our first donor riot.
