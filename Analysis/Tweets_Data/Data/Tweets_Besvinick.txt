Besvinick	722278270365011968	2016-04-19T04:18:53	rsg agreed for “active" decisions. Bots become interesting when they passively “listen” &amp; emerge in convos, but will people be ok w/ that?

Besvinick	690046530477256704	2016-01-21T05:41:27	heathwblack yep—the # should’ve been gateway to curated &amp; finely tuned convos. Instead, we have Moments, which isn’t getting the job done.
Besvinick	690045626348916736	2016-01-21T05:37:52	heathwblack totally fair provided that the content is being created there. Most sports personalities aren’t sharing on Facebook, though.

Besvinick	683689951985270785	2016-01-03T16:42:41	tristanwalker semil haha, I’ll own that
Besvinick	683684126067654657	2016-01-03T16:19:32	wesleyverhoeve tristanwalker agreed. And despite being long TWTR and a virtual addict, the product has shortcomings &amp; gaps other can fill
Besvinick	683683903236915201	2016-01-03T16:18:39	mikeytom tristanwalker the Snapchat power users are using it like I (we?) use Twitter. It’s a constant source of new content for them.
Besvinick	683683110291128321	2016-01-03T16:15:30	tristanwalker for ex, when CaseyNeistat did a SC story from Ferguson, he showed how irrelevant Twitter could be. Soon after, Tw acqd Peri
Besvinick	683682631649746944	2016-01-03T16:13:36	tristanwalker 100%, which is why I think Twitter needs to be more afraid of them than anyone and why the Periscope deal was so critical
Besvinick	683681987920539648	2016-01-03T16:11:02	tristanwalker the easiest way to see what’s going on in near real-time with your “friends” and discover interesting content made for you/SC
Besvinick	683681608931655680	2016-01-03T16:09:32	tristanwalker and so I think it has way more latitude and avenues for growth despite this potential confusion; Twitter is too constrained
Besvinick	683681142638297088	2016-01-03T16:07:41	tristanwalker I think describing SC &amp; conveying its value is harder than Twitter, but SC wasn’t afraid to mess w/ its initial atomic unit
Besvinick	683542209547866112	2016-01-03T06:55:37	karangoel probably one of the closest things but those are private
Besvinick	683541976482983936	2016-01-03T06:54:41	karangoel great product and burgeoning community but not good for live, real-time conversation
Besvinick	683541799835680770	2016-01-03T06:53:59	karangoel You’d be hard-pressed to find someone w/ a worse addiction to Twitter than I, but sometimes another service can fill in gaps
Besvinick	683540931786702848	2016-01-03T06:50:32	karangoel it’s a shame that Twitter can’t handle thoughtful discussion among numerous users due to character limits and follow constraints
