rachsyme	722784438795505664	2016-04-20T13:50:13	Its saying: take material, and read it (you still must be always reading, notating, analyzing) and then use it in a way that only you could
rachsyme	722784077389152256	2016-04-20T13:48:47	For so long the academy was about getting it right, interpreting sources the correct (read: hegemonic) way; this is bending them to a life
rachsyme	722783762673725440	2016-04-20T13:47:32	There's an opening up happening for a whole new canon of voices to what they notice, what texts pop out for them, their essential sources

rachsyme	722782731327971328	2016-04-20T13:43:26	The other thing about this new form is it allows for as many voices as those who want to take it on, because your synthesis won't be mine

rachsyme	722777646321373186	2016-04-20T13:23:14	and when these synthetic performances hit a frenzy, nothing else hits me so straight in the heart
rachsyme	722777053548847104	2016-04-20T13:20:52	it's a whipping together of small ideas into soft peaks + then folding those peaks into a big meringue; sourcing itself becomes performance
rachsyme	722776636597219328	2016-04-20T13:19:13	but it's also not simply plumbing the self for material, like saying, i love woolf and youtube haul videos equally, let me spin that to gold
rachsyme	722776319734497281	2016-04-20T13:17:57	alyssaharad hmmm i see it more as feeling okay about moving sources into your toolbox and not apologizing for doing so

rachsyme	722774829879808001	2016-04-20T13:12:02	I think what I find most moving is this new act of deep synthesis; it's writing that accomodates everything you've ever read, felt + thought
rachsyme	722774122632126464	2016-04-20T13:09:13	but sadly the key to doing Well Read Woman well is to be well, well read I wish I could stop everything and read for an entire year

rachsyme	722773216125591554	2016-04-20T13:05:37	it's more of a flaneurism the mind (brain flaneurism?) that is bold coming from women; it's saying: let me guide you thru a museum of ideas
rachsyme	722772418608046080	2016-04-20T13:02:27	obviously this Well Read Woman writing happened before now -- gornick, sontag, rebecca west, arendt, etc. -- but there's something new here

rachsyme	700107882583498752	2016-02-18T00:01:41	the WORST thing fuller house could have done was act embarrassed of itself/sick of its own jokes, instead it celebrates itself like a selfie

rachsyme	700107068984922113	2016-02-17T23:58:27	it's taking the clammoring for reboots/millennial nostalgia listicle train and being like, "well, you f-ing asked for this. here. you. go."

rachsyme	699699077718667265	2016-02-16T20:57:14	clearly the cultural output is different (lol 2 ppl who are like, how dare you besmirch fsf); i'm talking about america + the masculine
rachsyme	699698227138990080	2016-02-16T20:53:51	in that there is an american royalty aspect to them but one that has always felt somewhat unstable; like either element is combustible
rachsyme	699698016291311620	2016-02-16T20:53:01	there are a lot of clear differences/dynamics at play here but it would be easy to put k&amp;k in the same cultural position as s&amp;z in the 20s
rachsyme	699697413196533760	2016-02-16T20:50:37	both are attracted to and repulsed by wealth unable to control spending on any level but always dressed to the nines  zelda had great furs
rachsyme	699697184602587136	2016-02-16T20:49:43	both had/have very strong ideas about america + what it means to succeed in america; they are deeply, utterly american but obsessed w france
rachsyme	699696923020763136	2016-02-16T20:48:40	both from the midwest both married debutantes with questionable reputations both referred to their own potentials from the youngest age
rachsyme	699695960524505088	2016-02-16T20:44:51	this is fitz writing could also be kanye, in another light 
rachsyme	699695680965713920	2016-02-16T20:43:44	when fitz wrote the crackup in 1936, he was in much debt. still married to his dream girl (tho kim/zelda are far different women fwiw);
rachsyme	699695315079864320	2016-02-16T20:42:17	who wants me to write this piece lol
rachsyme	699695125438586880	2016-02-16T20:41:32	what we might be witnessing right now is the crack-up period fitzgerald was 40 when he published it kanye is 38
rachsyme	699694809670352897	2016-02-16T20:40:16	not to go too deep down the rabbit hole, but i am writing a book about fsf, + there are a lot of parallels between fitz + west across time

rachsyme	699692145805021184	2016-02-16T20:29:41	in this analogy, fame is daisy music is the cool shirts and the blue garden fashion is the green light kim is wolfsheim we are all nick
rachsyme	699691186085302272	2016-02-16T20:25:53	here's my theory and no one is paying me for it, it's totally for free kanye might be gatsby
rachsyme	699689535488262144	2016-02-16T20:19:19	i mean u gotta hand it to kanye, he is helping a lot of people make $370 a day in thinkpiece money alone

rachsyme	699658143186489344	2016-02-16T18:14:35	anyways! fame corrupts and art saves and when an artist of fame marries a famous artist there are cultural machinations we won't understand

rachsyme	697490450672914433	2016-02-10T18:40:56	anyways these are just a few things i learned from listening 2 women who have been fighting the fight for 4 decades; story coming soon!
rachsyme	697489183343013890	2016-02-10T18:35:54	so it's not metaphorical gains, it's people's healthcare, it's how they live and get to create for many years into the aging process
rachsyme	697489027918929921	2016-02-10T18:35:17	because if you do enough directing, the dga pays for your pension/retirement; many women who fought in the 2nd wave now don't have benefits
rachsyme	697488656714625024	2016-02-10T18:33:49	when we are fighting for young women to get film work, we aren't just fighting symbolically, we are fighting for their union membership
rachsyme	697487350948065281	2016-02-10T18:28:37	if you feel lost, look to those who came before you and forged paths for you; there are answers and worthy truths to be found there
rachsyme	697487006214004736	2016-02-10T18:27:15	people are always asking about fresh new voices, but i can assure you that some of the most vibrant voices i hear are from women 55+
rachsyme	697486618110861313	2016-02-10T18:25:43	if you are a young woman in an industry looking for inspiration, here's a tip few people will tell you: go email an older woman in yr biz
rachsyme	697485987778269185	2016-02-10T18:23:12	ales_kot soon! transcribing hours of talks takes longer than you'd hope but barreling through
rachsyme	697485419022327809	2016-02-10T18:20:57	GUYS THIS PIECE IS GONNA MAKE U SO MAD
rachsyme	697485376986939393	2016-02-10T18:20:47	one almost happened but in the end did not because they wanted a big-name man (who was producing) to direct + he wouldn't/stood by the woman
rachsyme	697485081179525120	2016-02-10T18:19:36	one of the women slid a list across a table to me w/ 10 scripts she wrote that never got developed bc she was a woman; they were great ideas
rachsyme	697484493570101248	2016-02-10T18:17:16	but anyways talking to all these women has made me really think so deeply about sexism and agism in a totally new way + get v. angry again!
rachsyme	697484291002015746	2016-02-10T18:16:28	they ran an inquiry into the studios and sued the studios back when women had .05% of directing jobs; they lost, which is its own tragedy
rachsyme	697483926495961088	2016-02-10T18:15:01	if u don't know the original six, look em up (or read my piece soon); but they fought for material gains 35 YEARS AGO; + nothing has changed
rachsyme	697483583607435264	2016-02-10T18:13:39	i have had the extreme privilege/pleasure of spending the last two weeks having discussions with 5 of the original hollywood six for a story
rachsyme	697483261040316416	2016-02-10T18:12:22	no one is paying women to make movies yet, and i won't be quiet about it until 50% of the time people are paying women to make movies
rachsyme	697483136813420544	2016-02-10T18:11:53	here is the deal: representational hollywood victories are valuable but they are symbolic victories and not material ones for women

rachsyme	691757444415000578	2016-01-25T23:00:01	Here's my 5-Step Plan: 1. Don't start none, won't be none.  2. Stay in yo lane.  3. Shut up. 4. Don't answer that.  5. Say, "No Comment."

rachsyme	691756920890380291	2016-01-25T22:57:56	It makes no sense to have any other opinion when things are this tense
rachsyme	691756823938994176	2016-01-25T22:57:33	ALL you have to do right now if you are a white actress in Hollywood is say to the press: "I believe you, things are bad. End of comment."

rachsyme	691375837531262985	2016-01-24T21:43:39	i won't really be happy until i see a doorstop-size biography of a woman written by a woman tucked under subwaygoers arms because it's cool
rachsyme	691375627027529728	2016-01-24T21:42:49	but i think their stories must get bigger than that; they need to reach full phenomenon level, ham level, full cultural penetration level
rachsyme	691375408583942145	2016-01-24T21:41:57	there have been so many great books about women's histories; the movement to uncover narratives began in the 70s and has continued since
rachsyme	691374208501288961	2016-01-24T21:37:11	if you start to think about writing histories of women the way they would have wanted it as giving them proper burials it gets v. compelling

rachsyme	691372327804760064	2016-01-24T21:29:42	my book is about a woman who tried to lasso her story over and over again to that of a great man because that's what she knew she had to do
rachsyme	691371682100056065	2016-01-24T21:27:08	my life's work as a historian is about uncovering the narratives of erased women and i won't stop until one of them is as big a hit as HAM
rachsyme	691371407972896769	2016-01-24T21:26:03	me too, always 
rachsyme	691371211432017920	2016-01-24T21:25:16	this is why helfitzgerald is kind of like half of my heart 
rachsyme	691370500535230465	2016-01-24T21:22:27	just be aware that there were many, many women who lived 250 years ago who had lives epic enough to warrant three hour broadway musicals
rachsyme	691369681198841856	2016-01-24T21:19:11	rachsyme Had Eliza been uneducated and poor, she wouldn't have the paper to write nor the people to write to.
rachsyme	691369449274810368	2016-01-24T21:18:16	rachsyme And those women didn't have a medium to keep their stories alive. It's also a class act.
rachsyme	691369729538289665	2016-01-24T21:19:23	when i listen to the end of Hamilton I kind of think again about the idea of death masks + selves born on the waves 
rachsyme	691369095263035392	2016-01-24T21:16:51	one of the only ways you used to be able to toss yourself through an entire century of history as a woman was to lasso yrself to a Great Man
rachsyme	691368880485306369	2016-01-24T21:16:00	eliza put herself back into the narrative, but also she did it by telling the story of a man she married, by hooking herself into his legacy
rachsyme	691368602394611712	2016-01-24T21:14:54	so many women were lost to time, more lost than hamilton ever was, because they weren't great men, because they were willfully erased
rachsyme	691368388346671104	2016-01-24T21:14:03	it's all Who Lives Who Dies Who Tells Your Story it's ALL this idea of erasure/narrative/flinging yourself into the rushing stream of time
rachsyme	691368188362280960	2016-01-24T21:13:15	Been thinking a lot about the intersection of Selfie and Hamilton (&amp; thanks to amykate75 for the reminder of this) 
rachsyme	691367563947802624	2016-01-24T21:10:46	SarahCrossan you're welcome; glad we could talk it out, thanks for reading, let me know if you have any questions or further thoughts!
rachsyme	691367348096385024	2016-01-24T21:09:55	SarahCrossan but when i dug in i realized it hurts girls far more than any pic to discuss selfies in the language of shame/"bad feminism"
rachsyme	691367018541490176	2016-01-24T21:08:36	SarahCrossan i can absolutely see and understand your fears; they are the same fears that made me spend a year thinking/writing about this
rachsyme	691366548200628226	2016-01-24T21:06:44	SarahCrossan when tou should also be looking also into ways people are using the medium to dismantle the very gaze/pressure you fear most
rachsyme	691366320504463361	2016-01-24T21:05:50	SarahCrossan what you fear is patriarchy (WITH GOOD REASON), but use selfies as an easy access point to worry re: conformist standards
rachsyme	691365913606627329	2016-01-24T21:04:13	SarahCrossan when you say you fear selfies, or that you don't see selfies and feminism co-existing, you're putting fear in the wrong place
rachsyme	691365673671462912	2016-01-24T21:03:16	SarahCrossan but that doesn't mean you can discount a medium as promoting patriarchal standards; there are equal examples of the opposite

rachsyme	691364012173434881	2016-01-24T20:56:40	SarahCrossan how about you? has reading so many defenses of selfies in the last hour made you see them differently?
rachsyme	691363654005080064	2016-01-24T20:55:14	SarahCrossan my views came out of research and talking to people
rachsyme	690800515437883392	2016-01-23T07:37:31	"sculptures like these... were for the male gaze. Photoshop a phone to it and suddenly she‚Äôs seen as vain" 
rachsyme	691362759393546240	2016-01-24T20:51:41	i have to say i am genuinely moved to see so many passionate defenses of what selfies mean; plz don't hide from it!  
rachsyme	691361043474452481	2016-01-24T20:44:52	SarahCrossan people are passionate about ways of seeing that include them and often save their lives; which i would say makes sense
