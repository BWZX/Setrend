gruber	701188453577453569	2016-02-20T23:35:29	stevebob Yes, that we know. But I don’t think they were using MDM, otherwise they could just disable the passcode on device.

gruber	701187746438782977	2016-02-20T23:32:40	drance panzer kdrum Yeah, if it was MDM, the county could disable the phone passcode: 
gruber	701187174167871489	2016-02-20T23:30:24	nscheffey But if you reset the iCloud password, you have to update the password on the phone.
gruber	701187088444694528	2016-02-20T23:30:03	nscheffey Once you allow iCloud backups, iOS will initiate one whenever phone is being charged while connected to a known Wi-Fi network.

gruber	701184770789744640	2016-02-20T23:20:51	petsound Where does he win? He really needed to sweep Iowa, NH, and NV. Road ahead looks very very difficult for him.
gruber	701184530762354689	2016-02-20T23:19:54	ibrandonlee That sort of polling is nonsense at this stage of the game. Like trying to pick the 2018 Super Bowl winner.
gruber	701184272598753281	2016-02-20T23:18:52	slhamlet The Republicans have helped greatly in that effort as well, by using the word to describe Obama for 8 years.
gruber	701183937155100672	2016-02-20T23:17:32	Most likely answer to my Q: the iCloud account was using a county email address, so they could control the confirmation to reset password.
gruber	701183665796153344	2016-02-20T23:16:27	tjdunnigan kdrum If it was MDM-managed they could have remotely cleared passcode lock on phone:

gruber	701183403715076098	2016-02-20T23:15:25	giordanobc That won’t happen. Nominees typically seek balance in VP pick.
gruber	701183173493919746	2016-02-20T23:14:30	raytraced tofias It certainly helps explain how he made the race as close as it is, but it only goes so far.
gruber	701182895390642177	2016-02-20T23:13:24	phuul kdrum That makes sense, and seems likely, but it needs to be asked because they haven’t explained.

gruber	701181100094312448	2016-02-20T23:06:16	kdrum Unclear, so far as I have seen. My guess: it was through the enterprise tools businesses can use to control work-issued iPhones.
gruber	701180153435709440	2016-02-20T23:02:30	tofias They brought this on themselves, by screaming for 8 years that the quite moderate Obama is a radical socialist.
gruber	701178597558591488	2016-02-20T22:56:19	kdrum The “owner” was the County Health Dept. It was his work-supplied phone. That’s who FBI threw under the bus in their footnote.
gruber	701178267122987010	2016-02-20T22:55:00	jnack Yes, implicit in that is “depending on November”.

gruber	684568204933476352	2016-01-06T02:52:33	kenwalker I would bet on it. I’m guessing 2015 iPhone 6-class internals.

gruber	684543019618533376	2016-01-06T01:12:28	kenwalker I’d strongly consider it. But I’d wager heavily that this phone will use A8, not A9.

gruber	682027442756841472	2015-12-30T02:36:28	Javi By keeping the money overseas, Apple maintains its leverage to get the laws changed.
gruber	682027346078085120	2015-12-30T02:36:05	Javi By your logic they should just give all their money to the IRS. That’s not how it works.
gruber	681973002934849540	2015-12-29T23:00:09	eli_schiff Put another way: the fact that 60 Minutes’s Apple profile is considered accurate by those of us who follow closely is a big win.

gruber	681972087750311937	2015-12-29T22:56:30	eli_schiff The point was, they had ~35 minutes of screen time to give typical people a basic understanding of Apple. I say they succeeded.
gruber	681961411673722880	2015-12-29T22:14:05	Javi eli_schiff I’m not sure I understand — you’re saying it would be patriotic to move the money into the U.S. and pay the current 40%?
gruber	681959000225779712	2015-12-29T22:04:30	eli_schiff But the fact that Cook became so clearly agitated, angry even, is a sign of good interviewing. Rose got him fired up.
gruber	681958859284582400	2015-12-29T22:03:56	eli_schiff I think Cook has a very strong point on taxes. It’d be foolish to repatriate the overseas money at current tax rates.
gruber	681957381601898497	2015-12-29T21:58:04	eli_schiff You have to consider it in the context of 60 Minutes’s broad audience.
