RameshPonnuru	703033406632935424	2016-02-26T01:46:40	I think Trump got every one of his lines into that 30-sec statement. Which says a lot about how many lines he's working with.
RameshPonnuru	703033153661890560	2016-02-26T01:45:40	Playing to people’s fears, though, does not seem like Trump’s biggest flaw or vulnerability.

RameshPonnuru	696146492290154496	2016-02-07T01:40:32	I think Christie both (a) knocked Rubio down a peg (b) made himself look bad. Advantage Cruz, Trump, Kasich, Bush.
RameshPonnuru	696145737248305152	2016-02-07T01:37:32	Not sure “bringing people together” is what Bush ought to be selling.
RameshPonnuru	696145458461327360	2016-02-07T01:36:25	Bush breezes right past his endorsement of Rubio for VP in 2012.
RameshPonnuru	696145189300256769	2016-02-07T01:35:21	and now both Rubio and Christie are looking petty.
RameshPonnuru	696144983255031808	2016-02-07T01:34:32	This Rubio line about Obama knowing what he’s doing. . . I see what he’s getting at, but I don’t think it’s working.
RameshPonnuru	696144744301359104	2016-02-07T01:33:35	So far, the senators are not having a good night.
RameshPonnuru	696143918589579268	2016-02-07T01:30:18	Rubio -- turns immediately on Obama.  What he did so successfully in Iowa debate.
RameshPonnuru	696143782539083776	2016-02-07T01:29:46	Joe Biden line doesn't get any reaction
RameshPonnuru	696143768148385792	2016-02-07T01:29:42	Gosh, I can't imagine how stunned Rubio must be to be asked why he's ready to be President...
RameshPonnuru	696142763545464832	2016-02-07T01:25:43	Carson: I won’t savage Cruz, just attack his ethics.

RameshPonnuru	696141674737725440	2016-02-07T01:21:23	Trump is wrong. He opposed the Iraq war in 2004 after we had invaded, he did not say we shouldn't go in.  
RameshPonnuru	696141521159065600	2016-02-07T01:20:46	Actual Trump quote: "We have to have a temporary something because there’s something not good that’s going on.”
RameshPonnuru	696141361830105088	2016-02-07T01:20:08	So far Trump is giving no indication that Denmark will be spared.
RameshPonnuru	696140944354238464	2016-02-07T01:18:29	I see the extra time was used to get the intros just right.
RameshPonnuru	696140736987840512	2016-02-07T01:17:40	What are Carson and Trump plotting?
RameshPonnuru	696140298758463488	2016-02-07T01:15:55	Wow, McCain and Graham are so Statler and Waldorf. GOPdebate
RameshPonnuru	696140081900429313	2016-02-07T01:15:03	So ABC has been lying to us about when this debate starts.

RameshPonnuru	696137061414408193	2016-02-07T01:03:03	BenjaminPGlaser LeonHWolf I am skeptical that most people have higher tolerance for 4 hours of debate than journalists do.
RameshPonnuru	696135866989854720	2016-02-07T00:58:18	LeonHWolf for real?

RameshPonnuru	696037191865098240	2016-02-06T18:26:12	Criticizing Rubio, or any other politician, for simply repeating versions of his stump speech is journalist myopia. No one else has seen it.
RameshPonnuru	695795225655009280	2016-02-06T02:24:43	We're four days after Iowa and I'm seeing a lot more Rubio, Jeb, Cruz coverage &gt; Trump. The second-order effects of Trump's IA loss.

RameshPonnuru	695745668749660160	2016-02-05T23:07:48	Endorsed.

RameshPonnuru	695652642333323264	2016-02-05T16:58:09	this list is awfully padded. Rand Paul's defeat doesn't, for example, contradict his being "interesting"

RameshPonnuru	695456782991417345	2016-02-05T03:59:52	Sanders believes a sufficiently large crowd outside McConnell's window would make him support campaign finance reform. I do not.
RameshPonnuru	695456435556241408	2016-02-05T03:58:29	Sanders: My Supreme Court nominees have to tell me they’ll rule how I want.
RameshPonnuru	695456014003544065	2016-02-05T03:56:49	After attacking Sanders for being unrealistic, this answer from Clinton about all the things she'll get done legislatively is odd.
RameshPonnuru	695454935303876608	2016-02-05T03:52:32	Sanders: I “believe in trade.” Except when it takes place in this world.
RameshPonnuru	695454027006550016	2016-02-05T03:48:55	Just a reminder that the reasons Clinton gave for her TPP flip-flop made no sense:

RameshPonnuru	695453241841164288	2016-02-05T03:45:48	if you’re against the state being involved in killing, you’re against the state.
RameshPonnuru	695453166322782208	2016-02-05T03:45:30	I’m against the death penalty. but that position can’t be justified on theory that state shouldn’t be involved in killing.
RameshPonnuru	695452440322113537	2016-02-05T03:42:37	They really should. 
RameshPonnuru	695452148457410560	2016-02-05T03:41:27	Hillary claimed this is all retroactive classification. IG determined multiple top secret (&amp; above) emails were classified from origination.

RameshPonnuru	695448538956718084	2016-02-05T03:27:07	Sanders: There’s a silent socialist majority.

RameshPonnuru	695444139719000064	2016-02-05T03:09:38	“You have to get action for action.” Really trying to resist a Bill Clinton joke here.
RameshPonnuru	695443584015691776	2016-02-05T03:07:25	Um, Hillary's taking credit for being Obama's advisor on Russia? Have fun with that legacy.
RameshPonnuru	695442414232702976	2016-02-05T03:02:46	Don't understand why Bernie hasn't invested in developing detailed progressive foreign policy that goes beyond rhetoric. Missed opportunity
RameshPonnuru	695442334901624833	2016-02-05T03:02:27	SethAMandel calling her a secretary is sexist.
RameshPonnuru	695442235781844992	2016-02-05T03:02:04	"I agree with the secretary" is probably the right answer for Bernie each question, unless he's studied up.
RameshPonnuru	695442097927622656	2016-02-05T03:01:31	Bernie always says "it must be Muslim troops on the ground." Not mutually exclusive from being American. 
RameshPonnuru	695439679374536704	2016-02-05T02:51:54	Maybe just a wee bit of overreaching there. 
RameshPonnuru	695440280376385536	2016-02-05T02:54:18	Clinton is doing very well except when her record forces her to say ridiculous things.

RameshPonnuru	695438601140588544	2016-02-05T02:47:37	Lots of other streets in our economy besides Wall Street!
RameshPonnuru	695438352724598785	2016-02-05T02:46:38	“I will look into it”—basically what I say to the kids when I mean, “no.”
RameshPonnuru	695437860481073153	2016-02-05T02:44:41	Two random hedge funders spending some money in a super PAC is not exactly all of Wall Street trying to stop Clinton.
RameshPonnuru	695437383660081152	2016-02-05T02:42:47	Clinton’s answer on the basic irrelevance of Glass-Stegall seems right.
RameshPonnuru	695437080172830720	2016-02-05T02:41:35	What’s HRC referring to when she says she tried to stop the financial crisis?
RameshPonnuru	695436828313198594	2016-02-05T02:40:35	Not sure citing Wall Street attacks on her same day as numbers of Wall Street contributions to her came out a good HRC strategy.
RameshPonnuru	695432769028009984	2016-02-05T02:24:27	Shhhhh....  Don't tell anyone. 
RameshPonnuru	695436415849508864	2016-02-05T02:38:56	American Camping Association, Wall Street—pretty much same thing, right?
RameshPonnuru	695436239692963841	2016-02-05T02:38:14	Good answer from Sanders on the public funding system. There's no reason for candidates to disarm themselves for principle.

RameshPonnuru	695434731278594049	2016-02-05T02:32:15	Sanders didn’t give an effective response on derivatives/swaps.
RameshPonnuru	695434398863208448	2016-02-05T02:30:55	Good lord, HRC attacking Sanders for voting for her husband's financial deregulation again.
RameshPonnuru	695433977784463360	2016-02-05T02:29:15	Sanders is coming across as more truthful than Clinton on the impact of campaign donations.
RameshPonnuru	695433671759671296	2016-02-05T02:28:02	See, e.g., here 
RameshPonnuru	695433432482983936	2016-02-05T02:27:05	Woman who has implied Sanders is racist and sexist comes out against “innuendo” in campaigns.
RameshPonnuru	695433262865330178	2016-02-05T02:26:25	If Clinton is not part of the establishment than there is no such thing as the establishment. And there is such a thing as the establishment
RameshPonnuru	695433034007498752	2016-02-05T02:25:30	Saying that she can’t be establishment b/c she’s a woman is absurd.

RameshPonnuru	695431497956786176	2016-02-05T02:19:24	Problem with safe answer (Obama=progressive) is it doesn’t make sense of his view of Clinton.
RameshPonnuru	695431368319193090	2016-02-05T02:18:53	I do occasionally wonder if anybody remembers when Clinton White House  was divided into lefty "Rodhams" and centrist "Gores."

RameshPonnuru	687836259486662656	2016-01-15T03:18:38	Rubio has handled all his exchanges well but this debate has focused surprisingly little on him so far.

RameshPonnuru	687826778317033473	2016-01-15T02:40:57	Rubio should respond: I still think New Jersey needs you, Chris! Go back there.
