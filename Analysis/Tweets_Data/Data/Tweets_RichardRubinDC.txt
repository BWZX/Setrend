RichardRubinDC	706447864575164416	2016-03-06T11:54:30	That doesn't meant every tax goes up 34% or that each person's tax goes up 34%.

RichardRubinDC	687856326936903680	2016-01-15T04:38:22	Head over to the WSJ live blog for my quick recap on the VAT spat:  
RichardRubinDC	687855645060562945	2016-01-15T04:35:40	True. Payroll is sorta hidden now, but incidence clearer than corp. Isn't that report needed to calc SS benefits? 
RichardRubinDC	687853382711656448	2016-01-15T04:26:40	I could listen to Trump say the word "billion" over and over.
RichardRubinDC	687853112971808770	2016-01-15T04:25:36	findit89 clintbrooks ellencarmichael Well, maybe. But the payroll tax is pretty efficient to administer.
RichardRubinDC	687852466143006720	2016-01-15T04:23:02	And about visibility/transparency.  
RichardRubinDC	687851998205591552	2016-01-15T04:21:10	True. No consumer-level tax. Though that hiddenness is part of the critique. That said, corp inc tax is hidden now. 
RichardRubinDC	687851140898107392	2016-01-15T04:17:46	It's a VAT. It's not a "European-style VAT," in that it's subtraction method, not credit-invoice. But it's a VAT. 
RichardRubinDC	687850474897149952	2016-01-15T04:15:07	ryanfazio taxfoundation AlanMCole Maybe. But you get the "it's just a dime" argument that I heard all the time on local property tax.
RichardRubinDC	687850127222951936	2016-01-15T04:13:44	All, no. Most, yes. But is there any country that has VAT but no payroll or corporate income tax? 
RichardRubinDC	687849527659741185	2016-01-15T04:11:21	Also, one reason we have the highest corporate tax rate is that we DON'T have a VAT. Other countries use VAT to keep corporate rate down.
RichardRubinDC	687848412251750400	2016-01-15T04:06:55	Great q. The base is so big that going from 16% to 16.1% raises a lot of $$$.  
RichardRubinDC	687847917248327681	2016-01-15T04:04:57	Where is Cruz right? 1. Other taxes go away. That matters.  2. Economists like consumption taxes 3. More neutral across industries (2/2)
