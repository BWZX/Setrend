tvoti	718970829078331392	2016-04-10T01:16:18	Also: the genres with less character death tend to be far more white/straight-heavy. Romcoms, etc.
tvoti	718970133599772672	2016-04-10T01:13:32	The problem, as always, is Hollywood’s limited imagination in who “gets to” be the protagonist. Diversity is cheap w/o protagonist diversity

tvoti	718962735120134144	2016-04-10T00:44:08	ghostwritingcow Erinescence TV is actually more racially diverse right now than it was then. But maybe genre TV isn’t.
tvoti	718962440562606080	2016-04-10T00:42:58	Similarly, to name two white dude examples, if Good Wife and Mad Men had just sent Will and Lane off to a new job, much, much less power.

tvoti	718961904358567936	2016-04-10T00:40:50	I’m not persuaded by “stop killing characters off.” Yes, it can be cliche, but fans always want happy ending. Stories WON’T always want it.

tvoti	718918592360648704	2016-04-09T21:48:43	Obviously, the big picture answer is “better representation across the board.” But in the smaller picture of it all, it’s much tougher.

tvoti	684794951033466880	2016-01-06T17:53:33	Though that said, Netflix is launching two multi-cams before June, so shruggie guy.
tvoti	684794848705024000	2016-01-06T17:53:09	My suspicion (no idea if this is true) is that single-cam is easier to sell to streaming services, and that appeals to cable nets.
