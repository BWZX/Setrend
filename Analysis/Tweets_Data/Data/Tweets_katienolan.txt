katienolan	722601129750700032	2016-04-20T01:41:49	katienolan yeah here's how I feel about offsides reviews 
katienolan	722578271204847616	2016-04-20T00:10:59	MikeSteeleRadio wasn't about this specific call. Disallowing a goal bc of a blown call that may not even have provided an advantage is dumb
katienolan	722571666962911233	2016-04-19T23:44:44	katienolan it's like the NFL calling back a touchdown because they see a holding call on replay
katienolan	722572550270627840	2016-04-19T23:48:15	ZackEDoo because goals in hockey aren't easy. Being offsides doesn't guarantee you a goal. If the refs miss the call, you disallow a goal??
katienolan	722572205314322433	2016-04-19T23:46:53	MikeSteeleRadio Twitter ain't your medium. Stick to radio.
katienolan	722570737446424576	2016-04-19T23:41:03	Sta7ic to make sure a call is right, sure. But to be able to disallow a goal because a ref blew a (pretty easy) call? That's garbage
katienolan	722570451504001024	2016-04-19T23:39:55	adamcrowleySNR get it right the first time. It's offsides. Not that hard to spot.
katienolan	722570166610038784	2016-04-19T23:38:47	ndhuskerpower if a ref doesn't catch it you shouldn't be able to disallow a goal. That's got HUGE implications
katienolan	722569895322468357	2016-04-19T23:37:42	I'm so over this offsides review BS. Not adding anything to the game. Get it right the fuck out of here.
