HeerJeet	724401402970140673	2016-04-25T00:55:27	24. Douthat is right on big point: reactionary mind is literary. It's rooted in feeling &amp; imagination rather than calculating self-interest
HeerJeet	724400428457185280	2016-04-25T00:51:35	KebabRemovalAct I think the opposite is true.

HeerJeet	724399199622565888	2016-04-25T00:46:42	22. The Reactionary Mind is a romantic mind. When politicized, it is not humble &amp; pessimistic but ambitious attempt to remake world.
HeerJeet	724398558720327680	2016-04-25T00:44:09	21. Edmund Burke's panegyric to Marie Antoinette was of a piece with romantic exultations found in Wordsworth &amp; Coleridge.

HeerJeet	724397487163883520	2016-04-25T00:39:54	19. Older traditionalism (pre-French Revolution) just tried to maintain status quo. Reactionary mind more emotionally charged defence.
HeerJeet	724397102176964609	2016-04-25T00:38:22	18. Reactionaries, conversely, are not really pessimistic but rather romantic egotist insanely confident about ability to remake world.

HeerJeet	724070251869147136	2016-04-24T02:59:35	13. A Heidegger or an Ezra Pound could provide intellectual gloss to movements that still had some pretence to intellectual ambition.

HeerJeet	724067455220473857	2016-04-24T02:48:28	9. As against Heidegger &amp; Eliot, what we have today are think tank conservatives, who are essentially just right-wing liberals.
HeerJeet	724067169445785600	2016-04-24T02:47:20	8. The great reactionaries seem to have disappeared. There aren't many counterparts to Heidegger or Eliot.

HeerJeet	724066342979158016	2016-04-24T02:44:03	7. In early 20th century there existed large pantheon of reactionary thinkers: Heidegger, Schmitt, Eliot, Kipling, Yeats, Pound, Maurras etc
HeerJeet	724065513970786305	2016-04-24T02:40:45	SWGoldman I think pessimism about human nature runs through even the most ameliorative liberalism
HeerJeet	724065100303355908	2016-04-24T02:39:07	6. Douthat has a point that the reactionary sensibility has largely disappeared from intellectual life aside from the dingbats of alt right
HeerJeet	724064074527584256	2016-04-24T02:35:02	5. Judith Shklar's great essay "The Liberalism of Fear" is a necessary corrective to Douthat: 
HeerJeet	724063522586529792	2016-04-24T02:32:50	4. Liberalism is rooted in fear: fear of arbitrary authority, fear of mob rule, fear of theocracy: a guarded ideology, not optimistic one
HeerJeet	724062967835320320	2016-04-24T02:30:38	3. Liberalism, classical &amp; modern, is ameliorative in intent but pessimistic about human virtue &amp; perfectibility, hence belief in process

HeerJeet	722097514342719492	2016-04-18T16:20:37	ckilpatrick pefrase My advice is to look at Jesse Jackson's movement building in 1980s NOT to retreat to academy.
HeerJeet	722097270624296960	2016-04-18T16:19:39	6. By social blocks I mean the groups Jackson cultivated in non-presidential election years: black churches, unions,LGBT groups.
HeerJeet	722096670784282624	2016-04-18T16:17:16	5. Instead of mimicking existing Dem political establishment, a more fruitful route is to Rainbow coalition alliance of social blocks.

HeerJeet	722094745854558209	2016-04-18T16:09:37	3. The partial exception was Jesse Jackson's Rainbow coalition, which had a good near decade run as force on left of the party.

HeerJeet	722094041232490496	2016-04-18T16:06:49	1. There's stuff I disagree with in the jbouie but the key take-away is Sandersism has contours of insurgency but needs to become movement.

HeerJeet	719529962672238594	2016-04-11T14:18:05	This is considered a scandalous statement by some.

HeerJeet	719503228027670529	2016-04-11T12:31:51	scooniepenn Not looking to be persuaded, but interested in how people make persuasive arguments.
HeerJeet	719390041043255298	2016-04-11T05:02:06	RakiahNoari MattBruenig emilynussbaum But there's never been a self-proclaimed democratic socialist whose won White House. So: risky.
HeerJeet	719389879080218624	2016-04-11T05:01:27	RakiahNoari MattBruenig emilynussbaum To me key issue is: who is more likely to win. We know centrist liberals can win (Clinton, Obama).
HeerJeet	719389297930039296	2016-04-11T04:59:08	MattBruenig Jkm920213 emilynussbaum I think being centrist is more likely to win presidency, not get GOP congress to co-operate.
HeerJeet	719387973062651904	2016-04-11T04:53:53	emilynussbaum Yeah, sorry for the original confusing wording. I should've followed twitter protocol

HeerJeet	719385881644253184	2016-04-11T04:45:34	MattBruenig emilynussbaum Oh, I assume GOP will obstruct both Sanders &amp; Clinton, whoever wins.
HeerJeet	719383494120579073	2016-04-11T04:36:05	emilynussbaum Harsh but fair.

HeerJeet	719382585680519168	2016-04-11T04:32:28	AlecMacGillis 1) LGBT stuff largely cost-free so easy for business &amp; rich Dems to support. (No new taxes).
HeerJeet	719382012751179776	2016-04-11T04:30:11	joshtpm Media focus on super-delegates is preventing Sanders supporters from realizing he's being creamed in popular vote. Bad system!
HeerJeet	719381306799357952	2016-04-11T04:27:23	michelledean Have you tried the people at Drunk History? I feel like they need to have more episodes involving women.
HeerJeet	719369396108587008	2016-04-11T03:40:03	markopp1 This is tangential but I do think there's grounds for firing an anti-Semitic or racist prof even if they have tenure.
HeerJeet	719367985408958464	2016-04-11T03:34:27	markopp1 As, by the way, do TNR and the Nation. (I don't think Eric Alterman can be accused of ignoring anti-Semitism).
HeerJeet	719367718537990144	2016-04-11T03:33:23	markopp1 If by media you include NY Times, New Yorker, &amp; Washington Post -- these are all places that discuss anti-Semitism.
HeerJeet	719367391457775616	2016-04-11T03:32:05	markopp1 Well, virtually entire parliament, including social democratic NDP, is against BDS: 
HeerJeet	719366492878475268	2016-04-11T03:28:31	markopp1 Taken very seriously -- to the point the Parliament of Canada has condemned BDS protests.
HeerJeet	719366209704210433	2016-04-11T03:27:24	markopp1 Sure but type of anti-Semitic violence that's out there isn't coming from Oberlin profs. It has a different social basis.
HeerJeet	719365539525693443	2016-04-11T03:24:44	markopp1 Reason this story received little attention was it was hard to see it as part of anything more than some profs are weirdos.
HeerJeet	719365378816786432	2016-04-11T03:24:06	markopp1 Interesting thing about story is it received almost no media attention (handful of newspaper articles) 3/n
HeerJeet	719365152777334784	2016-04-11T03:23:12	markopp1 A Jewish student complained &amp; there was investigation. He was eased out of job (despite tenure). 2/n
HeerJeet	719364925899063296	2016-04-11T03:22:18	markopp1 When I was student at University of Toronto in 1980s, there was English prof who was extremely anti-Semitic in Ezra Pound way 1/n
HeerJeet	719364650186502144	2016-04-11T03:21:12	markopp1 Well, stories about individual profs are easy to dismiss as examples of eccentricity rather than social trend. I'll give example
HeerJeet	719364172878901249	2016-04-11T03:19:18	markopp1 No, my point was that a lot discussion around anti-Semitism seems concern trolling, with Sanders as example.
HeerJeet	719363850504708096	2016-04-11T03:18:01	markopp1 I think that's a fair point -- the prof's facebook posts were blatantly bigoted so story should've gotten more attention.
HeerJeet	719363003850878977	2016-04-11T03:14:39	markopp1 Trolling is objecting to Sanders responding to anti-Semitism on his terms rather than in way Tablet would have wanted.
HeerJeet	719362862326628352	2016-04-11T03:14:06	markopp1 I wasn't talking about you but an article in Tablet on the matter: 
HeerJeet	719362242605670400	2016-04-11T03:11:38	nathanwhitlock emilymkeeler Oh, you can safely assume any subtweets are about you.
HeerJeet	719362054096818176	2016-04-11T03:10:53	markopp1 Yet Tablet presents this as an example of Sanders failing to respond properly.
HeerJeet	719361800127561728	2016-04-11T03:09:52	markopp1 And the audience at Sanders event clearly very hostile to anti-Semitic question (booing person asking it).
HeerJeet	719361653356294144	2016-04-11T03:09:17	markopp1 Look at this video:  you see Sanders responding to anti-Semitic question by saying "I'm proud to be Jewish"
HeerJeet	719361369749987329	2016-04-11T03:08:10	markopp1 There's a little too much concern trolling about this, as when Tablet went after Sanders response to anti-Semitic question
HeerJeet	719360008568315905	2016-04-11T03:02:45	markopp1 Well, apart from this story, I think anti-Semitism gets discussed a fair bit in Nation, TNR, Atlantic, New Yorker, NY TImes, etc
HeerJeet	719357576266313728	2016-04-11T02:53:05	markopp1 I can't speak for everyone but I tended to just file that story in "Oberlin is a dingbat school" part of my brain.
HeerJeet	719355941888479232	2016-04-11T02:46:36	markopp1 Naw, you just need a funky title: Gurus Gone Bad. Or: Sex and the Single Spiritual Teacher.
HeerJeet	719355220019380224	2016-04-11T02:43:44	MATTYMONKEES What's your thought on why he prefers in-kind donations to cash?
HeerJeet	719354629868232704	2016-04-11T02:41:23	MayankSeksaria hilzoy Yep. He's been engineering a presidential run since at least 2011, possibly much earlier.
HeerJeet	719354463656366080	2016-04-11T02:40:43	markopp1 Also, a book on spiritual teachers &amp; gurus who are also sexually abusive.
HeerJeet	719354050311901184	2016-04-11T02:39:05	markopp1 The attempt of young Jews in diaspora to develop a Jewish identity that is both post-Holocaust &amp; post-Zionist.
HeerJeet	719353378472480768	2016-04-11T02:36:25	MayankSeksaria hilzoy Right, but most rich people, especially politically ambitious ones, find it useful to give actual cash.
HeerJeet	719349329295753217	2016-04-11T02:20:19	MayankSeksaria hilzoy No, lots of genuinely rich people give to charity to help offset taxes. Trump is probably, at best, cash poor.
HeerJeet	719345463078612992	2016-04-11T02:04:57	The fact that Trump doesn't give actual money to charities suggests that he also doesn't pay taxes. Doesn't need write-off.
HeerJeet	719344626042343424	2016-04-11T02:01:38	jbouie True of almost any Judd Apatow movie -- never really a script, just a series of sketches.

HeerJeet	719339185426022401	2016-04-11T01:40:01	AndyKirn I don't think he even owns a lot of real estate. I think he just rents out his name.
HeerJeet	719337423105302528	2016-04-11T01:33:00	emilymkeeler See my twitter feed, passim.
HeerJeet	719337147002654720	2016-04-11T01:31:55	Trump is 1) very cheap 2) not nearly as wealthy as he claims to be.  
HeerJeet	719334723106037760	2016-04-11T01:22:17	Good piece by HeerJeet on Clinton's blind spot about the necessity of radical activism: 
HeerJeet	719331479281647616	2016-04-11T01:09:23	ebruenig Yeah. I actually also don't think Vonnegut said that. Googling it, I can't find any non-flaky sources for it.
HeerJeet	719330867127128064	2016-04-11T01:06:57	ebruenig Also I don't think it's true. Lots of great non-depressed writers out there.
HeerJeet	719330289688961025	2016-04-11T01:04:40	Interesting that Drudge is still on in on Trump. Supports his "GOP stealing election from me" narrative. 
HeerJeet	719329506264248320	2016-04-11T01:01:33	@das_kunk Exactly. That's what the NY Times wants -- an unabashed "celebration of male heterosexuality.”
HeerJeet	719328799209480192	2016-04-11T00:58:44	JamilSmith Ah, that makes sense.
HeerJeet	719328694372851712	2016-04-11T00:58:19	@das_kunk But would you say the novel is "very much a celebration of male heterosexuality"? I don't think so.
HeerJeet	719328444459393026	2016-04-11T00:57:20	pnh MadelineAshby Yeah, I think a lot of writers trying to redeem what is valuable in Lovecraft while leaving the racism/misogyny behind.
HeerJeet	719328220533944321	2016-04-11T00:56:26	JamilSmith Isn't there a Black Panther cameo near the end of the clip?
HeerJeet	719327058170638336	2016-04-11T00:51:49	RayHeard See, this is what I mean. Telling people to kill themselves isn't cool. Light up a joint, man.
HeerJeet	719326876339204096	2016-04-11T00:51:06	limitedinc3 All definite precursors (I'd add Leibling &amp; Mitchell) but New Journalism took subjectivity further.
HeerJeet	719324643027525632	2016-04-11T00:42:13	RayHeard Dude, you need to figure out a way to relax. Maybe smoke some pot?
HeerJeet	719309346040057856	2016-04-10T23:41:26	themiddlespaces But a lot of this stuff is trying to do anti-racist Lovecraftian fiction.
HeerJeet	719309243095085056	2016-04-10T23:41:02	By surge of Lovecraft pastiches I'm thinking of recent work by Alan Moore, Matt Ruff, Victor LaValle, and Kij Johnson. Among others.
HeerJeet	719308909278859266	2016-04-10T23:39:42	FranklinH3000 Alan Moore's recent work, as well as stuff by Matt Ruff, Victor LaValle, and Kij Johnson;
HeerJeet	719308068526407680	2016-04-10T23:36:22	Why the sudden surge of Lovecraft pastiches?
HeerJeet	719280944595775491	2016-04-10T21:48:35	KStreetHipster I mean with Williamson's explicit point that the rich are better &amp; the middle class are parasites.
HeerJeet	719280018132746242	2016-04-10T21:44:54	I would love for GOP to run on this platform of less taxes for rich &amp; more taxes for middle class.  
HeerJeet	719211842183307264	2016-04-10T17:14:00	gdnickel So Pagan critics had same position as Falwell and Robertson in our day?
HeerJeet	719203568365015041	2016-04-10T16:41:07	I dunno, I'd say fending off Hitler as he controlled Europe in 1940 was a bigger deal.  
HeerJeet	719169594082983936	2016-04-10T14:26:07	Well, Putin does have a good track record of winning elections.  
HeerJeet	719138411827879936	2016-04-10T12:22:12	The head of the American Enterprise Institute says we need more bipartisanship. Someone better buy davidfrum a drink today.
HeerJeet	719138243955073025	2016-04-10T12:21:32	The GOP is like a Trollope heroine who has to choose between unsavoury suitors: an obvious scoundrel &amp; a devious schemer.
HeerJeet	719135456269594624	2016-04-10T12:10:28	Remember when Ted Cruz walked out on a group of oppressed Christians whose impending genocide he was using as a campaign prop? Good times!
HeerJeet	719131571375239168	2016-04-10T11:55:02	davidfrum You can't be picky when the ship is going down but Ted Cruz is a hell of a lifeboat.
HeerJeet	719009199636635648	2016-04-10T03:48:46	NathAt adelatalbot Yeah, Plimpton's the best example. Mailer also did some boxing reporting (and boxed) but not at Plimpton level.
HeerJeet	719008230484099073	2016-04-10T03:44:55	do Americans think basically everyone in Canada is bilingual in English and French
HeerJeet	719007152455585792	2016-04-10T03:40:38	20. New Journalist immersed themselves in events, Thompson took step further &amp; also immersed his mind in drugs &amp; wrote about that.
HeerJeet	719006766411812864	2016-04-10T03:39:06	19. If a New Journalist is like sociologist going to orgy, then Thompsons' gonzo journalism was like psychologist experimenting on own mind
HeerJeet	719006415977709568	2016-04-10T03:37:42	18. This was an addendum but quite a few people asked me how Hunter Thompson &amp; gonzo journalism fit into all this.
HeerJeet	719006035160109057	2016-04-10T03:36:11	17. In journalism, there's little of that ethical oversight, so New Journalism can lead to someone (like Talese) in highly dodgy situation.
HeerJeet	719005673451708418	2016-04-10T03:34:45	Eerily true likeness.  
HeerJeet	719005522242842624	2016-04-10T03:34:09	16. In sociology/anthropology, participant observers who immerse themselves in fraught subjects like sex or war have to get ethics oversight
HeerJeet	719004413222739969	2016-04-10T03:29:45	carigervin Oh yeah. She's actually been a much bigger figure than her husband for at least 30 years or more.
HeerJeet	719003204831150080	2016-04-10T03:24:57	15. In a sense, New Journalism as practised by Talese has always been a kind of voyeurism. That adds to the unease over the new article.
HeerJeet	719002699170054144	2016-04-10T03:22:56	RobertFiore1 That's a fair version of what happened. Book got hammered by reviewers.
HeerJeet	719002523831377920	2016-04-10T03:22:14	14. For Talese, immersing yourself in a story means to some degree merging your point of view with the people you are writing about.
HeerJeet	719002271686602752	2016-04-10T03:21:14	carigervin Sorry, editor.
HeerJeet	719002027313893376	2016-04-10T03:20:16	13. I think Thy Neighbor’s Wife offers good context for understanding the tricky ethical issues around Talese's New Yorker piece on voyeurs
HeerJeet	719001039370752000	2016-04-10T03:16:20	ThusBloggedA She's a famous literary agent so she appreciated that he got a best-seller out of it.
HeerJeet	719000811037003777	2016-04-10T03:15:26	12. More Doonsebury 
HeerJeet	719000493767307264	2016-04-10T03:14:10	11. In Doonesbury, Garry Trudeau had some fun with Talese's research methodology. 
HeerJeet	719000063528148994	2016-04-10T03:12:28	bendwilliams I'm getting there! Patience.
HeerJeet	718999985337929731	2016-04-10T03:12:09	10. Talese: “If you want to write about orgies, you’re not going to be in the press box with your little press badge keeping your distance."
HeerJeet	718999611906494466	2016-04-10T03:10:40	bendwilliams I think its an extreme case of a larger problem.
HeerJeet	718999359702966272	2016-04-10T03:09:40	9. Talese nearly destroyed his marriage in researching Thy Nieghbor's Wife because "research" demanded he go to massage parlours &amp; orgies.
HeerJeet	718998758323650560	2016-04-10T03:07:16	8. In writing about the sexual revolution in Thy Neighbor's Wife, Talese actually had sex with his neighbor's wife. 
HeerJeet	718997875431051267	2016-04-10T03:03:46	7. My understanding is Wolfe reconstructed the orgy based on interviews with the participants. Gay Talese has been less fastidious &amp; prissy.
HeerJeet	718997428586680320	2016-04-10T03:01:59	6. Tom Wolfe wrote about gang-bang in (I think) The Pump House Gang which made it sound like he was there. He wasn't, actually.
HeerJeet	718997157672398849	2016-04-10T03:00:55	5. Where New Journalism became tricky is when the writer starts having sex with the subjects of the reporting.
HeerJeet	718996911106035712	2016-04-10T02:59:56	4. New Journalism broke that faux-objectivity by being openly immersive: the journalist didn't hide his or her presence in the story
HeerJeet	718996548844015616	2016-04-10T02:58:30	3. Standard elite journalism prior to New Journalism prided itself on being detached, objective, disinterested. "The view from nowhere"
HeerJeet	718996241850322944	2016-04-10T02:57:17	2. 1960s New Journalism (Wolfe, Dideon, Talese, Mailer) was not just a literary revolution but also an epistemological one.
HeerJeet	718995885120618496	2016-04-10T02:55:51	1. The next Gay Talese discussion we need to have is about the participant observer ethics of New Journalism.
HeerJeet	718995101050011648	2016-04-10T02:52:45	noahmccormack Yep. And Talese in particular has pushed the boundaries of merging with the people he's written about.
HeerJeet	718994795016757248	2016-04-10T02:51:32	mdpollak ebruenig I've never seen the point of even that Frank Sinatra piece he's famous for.
HeerJeet	718994603383201792	2016-04-10T02:50:46	noahmccormack I think there's always been a latent ethics problem for New Journalism in terms of participant observers in bad deeds.
HeerJeet	718994130920026113	2016-04-10T02:48:53	noahmccormack Lots of worms in there.  I was thinking of doing a twitter essay about it but might end up doing an article instead.

HeerJeet	715363427405803521	2016-03-31T02:21:46	6. Make no mistake: denying Trump nomination will have huge costs &amp; tear party in half. But it's the only way.

HeerJeet	715336843802218496	2016-03-31T00:36:08	crapezous CathyYoung63 jessesingal GG didn't play any role in publicizing paper?
HeerJeet	715336191118221315	2016-03-31T00:33:32	CathyYoung63 Well, I reject the idea that there are only 2-sides to this debate (and that one has to pick a team).

HeerJeet	715031091569102848	2016-03-30T04:21:11	PhillipsPasha TotenCan Much more broadly popular than Trump, actually. Although also polarizing.
HeerJeet	715026796991946752	2016-03-30T04:04:07	eileen_gunn ramez It retrospect, Dave Sim was a precursor to the Rabid Puppies, MRAs, etc.
HeerJeet	715025825993777153	2016-03-30T04:00:16	BenjySarlin Trump's genius is he turns subtext into text.
HeerJeet	715023331934748678	2016-03-30T03:50:21	rusteenh Looking back, the signs are there from the start.
HeerJeet	715023168302366721	2016-03-30T03:49:42	PhillipsPasha He didn't create those people but without him their politics would have gone unarticulated &amp; remained latent.
HeerJeet	715022005268004864	2016-03-30T03:45:05	rusteenh Naw, I gave up mid-series.
HeerJeet	715021900582363136	2016-03-30T03:44:40	PhillipsPasha In terms of political analysis, I think horse race question of who will win is fairly trivial to question of social forces.
HeerJeet	715021635980554240	2016-03-30T03:43:37	16.  Like I said, someone better verse in Cerebus the Aardvark should pursue this line of inquiry.
HeerJeet	715021270367256576	2016-03-30T03:42:09	15. And of course the creator of Cerebus, Dave Sim, ended up a fringe far right sexist hermit, with a few culty followers.
HeerJeet	715020888027082753	2016-03-30T03:40:38	PhillipsPasha Question of whether these things hurt him is irrelevant to me. I'm more interested in what they say about him &amp; followers
HeerJeet	715020600817885184	2016-03-30T03:39:30	Beschizza I think he wanted to have an intense readership of really hard core fans. Was weeding out the casual readers.
HeerJeet	715020283304886272	2016-03-30T03:38:14	14. Other point of comparison is disassociated personality: Cerebus, like Trump, refers to himself in third person.
HeerJeet	715019318937960448	2016-03-30T03:34:24	PhillipsPasha I think what you fail to understand is way jokes like this reveal underlying attitudes.
HeerJeet	715019139178479616	2016-03-30T03:33:41	PhillipsPasha Um, Doug Ford made the same "joke" in 2010, so I think Canadians are ahead of the game.

HeerJeet	715017412387676164	2016-03-30T03:26:50	11. Throwing (and killing) baby was precursor to Trump's own comment that he could shoot someone on 5th Avenue &amp; not lose supporters.

HeerJeet	715016776191492097	2016-03-30T03:24:18	10. Point made by this sequence is that killing the baby doesn't end the worship of Pope Cerebus, rather it intensifies allegiance of base
HeerJeet	715016236040585221	2016-03-30T03:22:09	9. The blessing of the baby does not end well. 
HeerJeet	715015678181392384	2016-03-30T03:19:56	This is a wonderful, and entirely factual sentence 
HeerJeet	715015716215369728	2016-03-30T03:20:05	8. There's a sequence where Pope Cerebus is given a baby to bless 
HeerJeet	715015433997434882	2016-03-30T03:18:58	7. Pope Cerebus does more &amp; more extreme things, polarizing acts which lose followers but build a hard core of the faithful.
HeerJeet	715015133936885760	2016-03-30T03:17:46	6. There's a long storyline where Cerebus becomes Pope. And part of how he maintains power is via polarizing.
HeerJeet	715014716071010304	2016-03-30T03:16:07	5. But between Conan pastiche &amp; syncretic misogynist theology, there's some political/religious satire in Cerebus relevant to Trumpism
HeerJeet	715014308116242432	2016-03-30T03:14:30	brubaker snubpollard RobertFiore1 Yes, he could do this.

HeerJeet	714305837855014912	2016-03-28T04:19:17	HopeLNicholson It's all too real: 
HeerJeet	714305431104000001	2016-03-28T04:17:40	As opposed to our regular panel which is 66% or 75% male, we'll be 100% male so the forgotten male voice can be heard.

HeerJeet	714303382375235585	2016-03-28T04:09:32	shinangovani Yep -- and "this week we'll hear from men" -- because they haven't been heard on this issue yet?!?

HeerJeet	714282067677196288	2016-03-28T02:44:50	Sartor1836 I do think the fact we now live in the realm of necessity is, scripturally, a curse, although enjoyable work can be done in it.

HeerJeet	714280523909062657	2016-03-28T02:38:42	herbdool Right, but that's very recent. That was my only point!

HeerJeet	714279788555309060	2016-03-28T02:35:46	davidimarcus kcm74 jackshafer Yeah, Hofstader was unhappy with American consensus, not celebrating it -- that's something people miss.
HeerJeet	714279358714621952	2016-03-28T02:34:04	Sartor1836 That's a fair point, although I think of prosperity gospel as flip side of "work ethic" rather than subversion
HeerJeet	714278597658152960	2016-03-28T02:31:02	Sartor1836 I don't see that part of the Christian tradition as having much in common with modern work till you drop culture.

HeerJeet	714277630732677122	2016-03-28T02:27:12	herbdool Yeah, that's the type of argument I was thinking of.
HeerJeet	714276923644313600	2016-03-28T02:24:23	Sartor1836 Not sure I was questioning anyone's faith so much as criticizing habit of conflating modern ideas of work with what's in Bible.
HeerJeet	714276559767515137	2016-03-28T02:22:57	Sartor1836 I'm sorry you think it was cynical but in all honesty it came from sincere feeling about how Bible is misread.
HeerJeet	714275805036019716	2016-03-28T02:19:57	davidimarcus kcm74 jackshafer Well, I'd say Hofstadter's errors have more influential damage precisely because he was an fine writer
HeerJeet	714275189140234241	2016-03-28T02:17:30	Sartor1836 What better day than to offer my thoughts on scripture, which people are free to disagree with?
HeerJeet	714273786397220864	2016-03-28T02:11:55	Sartor1836  Isn't it possible that someone could have a different reading of the Bible from conservative Christians?

HeerJeet	713908817843634176	2016-03-27T02:01:40	14. We see both-side-ism at work in how CNN allows deranged Trump surrogates like Jeffrey Lord airtime. "Have to hear from both sides..."

HeerJeet	713904907779178496	2016-03-27T01:46:08	10. In normal politics, both-side-ism makes a lot of sense. You try to quote both sides, given them equal weight, let readers decide.
HeerJeet	713904687930540032	2016-03-27T01:45:15	9. Both-side-ism is a product of 2 party system &amp; mainstream media trying to distinguish itself as objective &amp; non-partisan.
HeerJeet	713904084567396353	2016-03-27T01:42:52	8. The major sin of media was not covering Trump but false equivalence (both-side-ism):

HeerJeet	713495838211837953	2016-03-25T22:40:38	natsecHeather Agree. Cruz even used "America First" slogan.
HeerJeet	713494810934423552	2016-03-25T22:36:33	jamestaranto If you take the words at their literal level (as Leo Strauss recommends) then Cruz enjoys fornicating with rats, but not Trump
HeerJeet	713492632928845824	2016-03-25T22:27:54	jamestaranto I gave the Watergate context here:  Cruz's remarks are still very strange.

HeerJeet	713483439400333312	2016-03-25T21:51:22	caleb_crain What does TNR have to do with this?
HeerJeet	713483026907406337	2016-03-25T21:49:44	MattTGrant Context here: 
HeerJeet	713482792307273728	2016-03-25T21:48:48	8. Trump's response will be interesting. "Believe me, most rat-copulators find me very attractive. I've had to turn down many offers."
HeerJeet	713482176696700928	2016-03-25T21:46:21	MattTGrant Yep.
HeerJeet	713481519134679040	2016-03-25T21:43:44	7. Strangely, this rat-copulation stuff is more humanizing than other rumors about Cruz. Maybe that's why he's putting it out there.
HeerJeet	713480444864409600	2016-03-25T21:39:28	6. Should've known my colleague brianbeutler had the rad-copulation parsing covered 
HeerJeet	713479948363665408	2016-03-25T21:37:30	5. Also no one asked Cruz if he wanted to copulate with Trump. That was something that sprang from Cruz's mind, unbidden.
HeerJeet	713479565742444544	2016-03-25T21:35:58	4. "Donald Trump may be a rat but I have no desire to copulate with him."So if rat were someone other than Trump you would copulate with him
HeerJeet	713479018310344704	2016-03-25T21:33:48	3. More context: 
HeerJeet	713478448279236608	2016-03-25T21:31:32	2. Context for that sentence (and meaning of "ratfucking") is here: 
HeerJeet	713478090647740416	2016-03-25T21:30:07	1. "Donald Trump may be a rat but I have no desire to copulate with him," Ted Cruz. This is really a sentence that deserves parsing.

HeerJeet	713205656535175168	2016-03-25T03:27:33	billmon1 It's a very suggestive comparison. Conservatives shut out of power for more than a decade because of fragmentation.

HeerJeet	713193781495877632	2016-03-25T02:40:22	billmon1 Exactly -- so a Cruz victory is fraught with dangers for the future.
HeerJeet	713192732513075200	2016-03-25T02:36:12	18. If Cruz controls party machinery, he's not going to let it go. He's young, ambitious, and has a very loyal cadre.

HeerJeet	713192160875536384	2016-03-25T02:33:56	16. The case for Trump is he'll run once, likely lose, and then fade. He's old and he has no organization. He's Asimov's Mule: no heirs.
HeerJeet	713191720381353984	2016-03-25T02:32:11	15. Who is the lesser evil for the GOP: Trump or Cruz? Trump is a more extreme personality but Cruz will stick around longer.

HeerJeet	713189823725481990	2016-03-25T02:24:39	13. Remember Trump's words on brokered convention: "I think you'd have riots. I'm representing a tremendous many, many millions of people."
HeerJeet	713189191924916225	2016-03-25T02:22:08	alanalevinson Sure.
HeerJeet	713189063793057792	2016-03-25T02:21:37	12. Going into Cleveland, Cruz might control party apparatus but Trump can claim plurality of votes backed up by an angry mob.
HeerJeet	713188697047302144	2016-03-25T02:20:10	11. The Mussolini path is to claim sidestep baroque party rules and control the streets.
HeerJeet	713187941770637312	2016-03-25T02:17:10	10. This is the Stalin path: Trump nominally "wins" the delegates but they are really Cruz loyalists: 
HeerJeet	713187551503200256	2016-03-25T02:15:37	9. Cruz is hoping to outwit Trump the way Stalin outwitted Trotsky: by controlling the party apparatus that makes the rules.
HeerJeet	713187248909385728	2016-03-25T02:14:25	8. And in conclusion:

HeerJeet	713186107156930561	2016-03-25T02:09:52	3. The Stalin path involves filling key positions (in this delegates) with loyal minions. This is Cruz's strategy.
HeerJeet	713185797487206401	2016-03-25T02:08:39	2. The Stalin path is to gain power through the party, the Mussolini path is to use the threat of violence to scare elite into surrender.

HeerJeet	713184853282267136	2016-03-25T02:04:54	jeffhauser mattyglesias Yeah, Cruz is filling his minions in key delegate spots. But if he defies Trump there could be violence.
HeerJeet	713184448817209344	2016-03-25T02:03:17	Remember how Stalin took the position of Party Secretariat which allowed him to fill his minions in key positions?  
HeerJeet	713183532554723328	2016-03-25T01:59:39	jeffhauser mattyglesias Cruz can't win without denying wishes of plurality (and possibly minority) that prefer Trump.

HeerJeet	712775550993965056	2016-03-23T22:58:28	6. Ford helped his constituents in the way a feudal lord might help some favored peasants. But he had a narrow vision. "I don't like bikes."

HeerJeet	712650633539489793	2016-03-23T14:42:06	rev_avocado jonathanchait Right. Sanders is a New Deal liberal, which by 2016 makes him sound like a raving socialist.
HeerJeet	712649867714109440	2016-03-23T14:39:03	jestlawrence True!
HeerJeet	712649746817507330	2016-03-23T14:38:34	behaviorclarity Well, I think 2012 shows that even if you do very well with white vote (59% for Romney) you can't win national election.
HeerJeet	712648965032816641	2016-03-23T14:35:28	jestlawrence True.
HeerJeet	712648464056721408	2016-03-23T14:33:28	behaviorclarity On which point? That SS won't work anymore or that GOP can't easily give up?
HeerJeet	712648219184893957	2016-03-23T14:32:30	This is something Americans don't understand, because of Cold War blinders.  
HeerJeet	712647906201743360	2016-03-23T14:31:15	davidimarcus jonathanchait That's true and something Americans can't see because of Cold War blinkers.
HeerJeet	712647680875323396	2016-03-23T14:30:22	FreddyLovesKarl Not a matter of rejecting ideas. If they change they lose base they have &amp; don't necessarily gain new ones.
HeerJeet	712647289899057156	2016-03-23T14:28:48	From 1968-2004, Southern strategy could win you elections more often than not. Now it's a liability nationally but GOP can't easily give up.
HeerJeet	712647032817627136	2016-03-23T14:27:47	Bigger picture of GOP problem: Southern Strategy great for winning national elections from 1968-2004, but now costs more votes than it gets
HeerJeet	712645083636477952	2016-03-23T14:20:02	DamonLinker jonathanchait The European social democratic parties include Marx as part of their lineage, rightly so.
HeerJeet	712644542483181568	2016-03-23T14:17:53	DamonLinker jonathanchait I think Chait is conflating Marxist-Leninism with Marxism.
HeerJeet	712644092203675650	2016-03-23T14:16:06	jonathanchait I think Kautsky was a better reader of Marx than Lenin, yes.
HeerJeet	712643625197314048	2016-03-23T14:14:15	davidimarcus Right. even John Stuart Mill realized that wasn't true.
HeerJeet	712643484692316161	2016-03-23T14:13:41	True. jonathanchait is the last Cold War liberal.

HeerJeet	712642524456701952	2016-03-23T14:09:52	DamonLinker jonathanchait One example is how liberal Democrats were pushed to anti-racism by CPC and socialists in 1930s.
HeerJeet	712642111976316928	2016-03-23T14:08:14	DamonLinker jonathanchait No, because liberalism has often been pushed to do a better job by the very socialists Chait despises.
HeerJeet	712641414681595904	2016-03-23T14:05:28	If we look at the actual history of liberalism as a practical ideology, then it has more than its share of illiberal moments.
HeerJeet	712641090692579328	2016-03-23T14:04:10	One problem with jonathanchait's argument is that it sees illiberalism as somehow mutually exclusive with actually existing liberalism
HeerJeet	712640536893464576	2016-03-23T14:01:58	JAMyerson chrislhayes I think it's a mistake to see liberalism (as a historical tradition) as mutually exclusive with illiberal policies

HeerJeet	712470794518003712	2016-03-23T02:47:29	The GOP theory seems to be that Americans are tired of having a calm, collected adult as president.

HeerJeet	712468313209774080	2016-03-23T02:37:37	neeratanden The historical record suggests Americans like to have adults as president, which bodes well for the Democrats.

HeerJeet	712463048137691136	2016-03-23T02:16:42	yeselson mtracey No I think Trump was thinking of the more personal stuff that was in the big New York Times profile of Heidi Cruz.

HeerJeet	712351965322158080	2016-03-22T18:55:18	4. Sanders skipped AIPAC. Trump showed up, gave standard "pro-Israel" bromides &amp; was cheered. If I were AIPAC I'd worry about that.

HeerJeet	710940486383460352	2016-03-18T21:26:35	MattBruenig Yeah, I think so. Although might be possible to at least bring in more voices from at least a poor background
HeerJeet	710939984937680896	2016-03-18T21:24:35	MattBruenig That's the problem: someone can come from working class but if they write for Post, NR, etc. they no longer belong to it.

HeerJeet	710912495423254528	2016-03-18T19:35:21	15. So: coming to terms with political upheaval means not just David Brooks intermingling with hoi polloi but more even more drastic changes
HeerJeet	710911628213100544	2016-03-18T19:31:54	14. The best writing on Trump has come from reporters in the field -- including sarahposner, mollyesque &amp; ddale8
HeerJeet	710911416006475776	2016-03-18T19:31:04	13. This is also on point.

HeerJeet	710910480508981249	2016-03-18T19:27:21	HeerJeet What about the novel idea of columnists who do reporting, rather than relying on their knowledge of people already in their orbit?
HeerJeet	710910015645880320	2016-03-18T19:25:30	11. Writers like ScottMcConnell9, DanielLarison, ToryAnarchist, SWGoldman have a much better sense of GOP base than Post's stable.
HeerJeet	710909547393712128	2016-03-18T19:23:38	10. If I edited Washington Post (lol) I'd poach someone from American Conservative, which has better sense of the diversity of the right
HeerJeet	710908756205412352	2016-03-18T19:20:30	9. The Washington Post doesn't need to hire pro-Trump columnists but should hire columnists who understand Trump's base.
HeerJeet	710908528534413313	2016-03-18T19:19:35	RWBhandari I see him as a conservative, albeit a mild one.
HeerJeet	710908352658804737	2016-03-18T19:18:53	8. Post does have one heterodox figure: the excellent libertarian Radley Balko. Otherwise straight GOP establishment types.
HeerJeet	710907997346799616	2016-03-18T19:17:29	7. Washington Post conservative columnists include: Gerson, Kagan, Krauthammer, Rubin, Thiessen, Will &amp; Zakaria.
HeerJeet	710907440586465281	2016-03-18T19:15:16	6. I've complained before about ideological narrowness of Washing Post liberal columnists (who tend to hug the center). Same true of right
HeerJeet	710907183127511040	2016-03-18T19:14:15	5. Brooks is a very moderate neo-conservative. Many of the people who columnize in Washington Post, New York Times, etc. are same.
HeerJeet	710906790377103360	2016-03-18T19:12:41	4. But the social limits that Brooks describes are part &amp; parcel with a limited ideological horizon.
HeerJeet	710906414869442560	2016-03-18T19:11:11	3. We "were not socially intermingled with his supporters." Some truth here. I suspect I know more Trump fans than Brooks does.
HeerJeet	710905880934555648	2016-03-18T19:09:04	2. Brooks blames failure of him &amp; his peers to foresee rise of Trump on circumscribed social circle:
HeerJeet	710905487634669570	2016-03-18T19:07:30	1. David Brooks latest column should provoke some thoughts on the rise of Trump &amp; the failure of the pundit class
