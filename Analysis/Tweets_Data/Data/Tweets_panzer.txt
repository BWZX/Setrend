panzer	700677332940394496	2016-02-19T13:44:28	JZdziarski im4hdi question remains if mechanics are different on non sep devices where passcode entanglement is done by iOS
panzer	700676677945290752	2016-02-19T13:41:52	JZdziarski im4hdi Interesting tidbit: on an SEP device (6S) it does not even go into lockout, suggesting auto rejection
panzer	700675946005663745	2016-02-19T13:38:58	JZdziarski im4hdi so how do you capture/detect a positive?
panzer	700674647763726336	2016-02-19T13:33:48	JZdziarski im4hdi Or if it's just conditional based on disabled state. Effectively same amount of guesses though so tilting windmills
panzer	700674479660277760	2016-02-19T13:33:08	JZdziarski im4hdi Question is whether correct pass is rejected because keypad disconnects from submission path when phone is disabled
panzer	700673836975415298	2016-02-19T13:30:35	im4hdi JZdziarski yes, I know. This is an amusing trick, but all it does is give unlimited 'fake' guesses once phone has been disabled.
panzer	700673141220061185	2016-02-19T13:27:49	im4hdi JZdziarski right (I actually do know this, it's in the brief, they haven't tried at all)
panzer	700672815238787072	2016-02-19T13:26:31	JZdziarski im4hdi No clue, but when you try this and enter the correct password it doesn't register as correct. so....

panzer	700443223857082368	2016-02-18T22:14:12	JulianLepinski As far as 'technical ability' they do not have it. The FBI is asking them to build it. That's the key.
panzer	700443032823291904	2016-02-18T22:13:27	JulianLepinski It's not extraction if the phone is unlocked. You can't read encrypted data. Unlocking it decrypts the data.
panzer	700435428080418816	2016-02-18T21:43:14	I guess I should get technical with myself and clarify that I meant iOS 7 and pre-iOS 7 devices.
panzer	700435181383979008	2016-02-18T21:42:15	JulianLepinski The government was requesting data extraction, which is impossible after iOS 8.
