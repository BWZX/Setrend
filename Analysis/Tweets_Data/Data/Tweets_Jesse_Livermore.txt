Jesse_Livermore	703053801368920066	2016-02-26T03:07:43	Did you ever hear past GOP winners, i.e., Reagan and GWB, talk about the national debt? No. How about past GOP losers, i.e., HW and Romney?
Jesse_Livermore	703053074433085440	2016-02-26T03:04:49	Head-on approach Rubio was taking doesn't work. Will create discomfort either through vagueness, or by going too far w/ suggestion of cuts.
Jesse_Livermore	703052247198871553	2016-02-26T03:01:32	Optimal strategy for a GOP candidate to talk debt is to lament the "problem" but then pivot to importance of reinvigorating growth to solve.
Jesse_Livermore	703050521251188737	2016-02-26T02:54:40	If this were Survivor, I'd say Kasich staying in race simply to hold back Rubio, help Trump. Then gets VP in exchange. Great deal for both.
Jesse_Livermore	703049948045021184	2016-02-26T02:52:24	Anybody know if Kasich ever balanced the budget as governor of Ohio?

Jesse_Livermore	703048611102216192	2016-02-26T02:47:05	There you go... Confirmed in the data. 
Jesse_Livermore	703048129042477057	2016-02-26T02:45:10	Number of people actually listening to this numeric mumbo-jumbo from Carson? Zero.
Jesse_Livermore	703047119318286337	2016-02-26T02:41:09	Twitter seems to agree. Rubio is on his game tonight. He's hitting his stride, particularly against Trump.
Jesse_Livermore	703046833078054916	2016-02-26T02:40:01	Rubio is using Christie’s tactic against Trump.
Jesse_Livermore	703045312022183936	2016-02-26T02:33:58	Retweet If You Think Rubio Is Winning The Debate! 
Jesse_Livermore	703046860064174081	2016-02-26T02:40:08	RUBIO!!!
Jesse_Livermore	703046808302460930	2016-02-26T02:39:55	Sarcastic Rubio is the best Rubio by a wide margin.
Jesse_Livermore	703044946371092480	2016-02-26T02:32:31	Just realized who Carson reminds me of... Admiral Stockdale.  Lights out, nobody home.
Jesse_Livermore	703044313173745665	2016-02-26T02:30:00	Rubio really is on it. May not still be winnable for him at this point, but he's maximizing whatever chances he has w/ the performance.
Jesse_Livermore	703042538878345216	2016-02-26T02:22:57	Trump coming across as more of an asshole in this debate than others IMO. Scuffling w/ a well-prepared Rubio is not a place where he shines.
Jesse_Livermore	703041341480050688	2016-02-26T02:18:12	Kasich so lame. Always trying to get an edge by chiding others for getting into it. Shut up &amp; suspend ur campaign already. Wasting our time.

Jesse_Livermore	702528437920006148	2016-02-24T16:20:06	norsemanvan only then will an incorrect switch (w/ whipsaw) happen.
Jesse_Livermore	702528217727393792	2016-02-24T16:19:14	norsemanvan the false positives are not a problem unless they also coincide w/ a negative price trend.

Jesse_Livermore	702316469439172608	2016-02-24T02:17:49	For Fed to use any kind of sea-lawyering to circumvent legislature &amp; impose wealth tax on depositors would b anathema to US political ethos.
Jesse_Livermore	702315657174462464	2016-02-24T02:14:35	quantian1 TheStalwart actually my bad, that's not U-6. Can't find anything in Fred. You?
Jesse_Livermore	702314654299607041	2016-02-24T02:10:36	Would the agency's charging of the supplier--i.e., its negative payment--have any legal validity? Obviously not. Silly to even discuss.
Jesse_Livermore	702314405019516928	2016-02-24T02:09:37	Question: appropriations bill authorizes fed agency to pay X to a supplier. Can the agency pay negative X--i.e., CHARGE the supplier?
Jesse_Livermore	702313063660191744	2016-02-24T02:04:17	haggerskme It violates the FRA unless the purchase/sale is happening in the open market.
Jesse_Livermore	702312901063811072	2016-02-24T02:03:38	haggerskme A creative idea, for sure. But I think the odds are pretty close to zero. And it would get tied up in court, b/c not an OMO.
Jesse_Livermore	702310604216860672	2016-02-24T01:54:31	Did not realize, prior to that Jesse_Livermore piece how good the unemployment rate was as a recession indicator.

Jesse_Livermore	702312536268406784	2016-02-24T02:02:11	AbeLolisted TheStalwart thx abe
Jesse_Livermore	702312296165437440	2016-02-24T02:01:14	danielsethlewis So I think the idea this would fly is ridiculous. No way a court would allow that kind of twisting. Especially on hot issue
Jesse_Livermore	702311969911492608	2016-02-24T01:59:56	danielsethlewis suggestion is that that could mean authorizing the agency to charge the supplier.  I.e., pay supplier a negative amount.
Jesse_Livermore	702311796003074049	2016-02-24T01:59:15	danielsethlewis A law might allow, for example, a government agency to pay X to a supplier, not to exceed some amount...
Jesse_Livermore	702311524426092544	2016-02-24T01:58:10	danielsethlewis think abt the implication for other legal scenarios of saying that paying a "negative" amount to someone is a legi concept.
Jesse_Livermore	702310955661701121	2016-02-24T01:55:54	danielsethlewis And surely isn't what legislature intended either--in 2006, idea of neg rates would have been seen as totally nuts.
Jesse_Livermore	702310728565280768	2016-02-24T01:55:00	danielsethlewis No reasonable sense in which authorizing X to pay money to Y can b interpreted to mean authorizing X to require Y to pay X.
Jesse_Livermore	702310463711752192	2016-02-24T01:53:57	danielsethlewis i'm pretty confident court would would defer to legislature on the issue, rather than the body the legislature supervises.
Jesse_Livermore	702309755465805824	2016-02-24T01:51:08	TheStalwart thx Joe!
Jesse_Livermore	702309686423388160	2016-02-24T01:50:52	haggerskme Even if it is, not  politically feasible to helo drop in that way. A helo drop directly to bank shareholders? For what purpose?
Jesse_Livermore	702309533557747712	2016-02-24T01:50:15	haggerskme Maybe, but the sale must be in the open market. If they are selling at huge discount to mkt price, is that met?
Jesse_Livermore	702308927396950016	2016-02-24T01:47:51	Chris_arnade agreed 100%. I would like congress to give that power to Fed. Then it would actually work. B/c otherwise, politics.
Jesse_Livermore	702308734186364928	2016-02-24T01:47:05	krscapital hey thx man, appreciated.
Jesse_Livermore	702308131859116032	2016-02-24T01:44:41	Chris_arnade Problem is, can only buy in secondary market. So can't pay exorbitant prices unless mkt has already taken them to such prices.
Jesse_Livermore	702307910425006080	2016-02-24T01:43:48	Chris_arnade Can also do very s/t muni bonds and foreign bonds.
Jesse_Livermore	702307691406819330	2016-02-24T01:42:56	Chris_arnade Generally, the securities they buy, other than gold, have to be an obligation of the US government.
Jesse_Livermore	702306237212282880	2016-02-24T01:37:09	Chris_arnade hey thx buddy, appreciated, means a ton coming from you.
Jesse_Livermore	702305782579105793	2016-02-24T01:35:21	Court will say it's not OK to get there through Fed playing bullshit wordgames that don't conform to any normal use of English language.
Jesse_Livermore	702305582548529152	2016-02-24T01:34:33	Court's position will b: if congress wants to give Fed power to impose neg rates, they're free to do so explicitly, w clear language.
Jesse_Livermore	702304417295368192	2016-02-24T01:29:55	Idea that "receive earnings to be paid by Fed" can be reasonably reinterpreted to mean "pay money to Fed" is absurd. 
Jesse_Livermore	702304101166493697	2016-02-24T01:28:40	In fact, the US won't even be able to follow ROW into neg rates, unless Congress makes significant changes to the 2006 law authorizing IOER.
Jesse_Livermore	702302751900872704	2016-02-24T01:23:18	Helo drops will have to come from legislatures, rather than CBs. So don't bet on them happening any time soon--especially not in the US.

Jesse_Livermore	701636162889191425	2016-02-22T05:14:31	Brett_Michael_ Two conclusions: (1) The foreign data is generally crappier,  more erratic, doesn't effectively timE their recessions...
Jesse_Livermore	701635304059351042	2016-02-22T05:11:06	Brett_Michael_ Here is same, timing JPN stock market, using U.S. retail sales/industrial production. Outperforms. 
Jesse_Livermore	701634981722861568	2016-02-22T05:09:50	Brett_Michael_ Here, for example, is Japan, using Japanese retail sales and industrial production. Underperforms. 
Jesse_Livermore	701634827699642368	2016-02-22T05:09:13	Brett_Michael_ Mixed. If use U.S. economic indicators on foreign mkts, works well.  If use foreign indicators, works poorly.

Jesse_Livermore	697989142664187904	2016-02-12T03:42:34	davealevine DavidSchawel I respect the potential in US housing but it's been a call for so long, and been wrong, I'm becoming skeptical...
Jesse_Livermore	697988968034402304	2016-02-12T03:41:52	davealevine DavidSchawel That's reasonable. Upside risk is that US picks up. But w/ energy gone, I don't see the real investment drivers.
Jesse_Livermore	697988765004861440	2016-02-12T03:41:04	davealevine DavidSchawel IMO, S&amp;P resilience is due to global beta. Much less levered to global growth than the Nikkei.
Jesse_Livermore	697988591046098944	2016-02-12T03:40:22	davealevine DavidSchawel I agree. But I don't see a true meltdown for US equities, ie greater than 20% down. Could be wrong.
Jesse_Livermore	697988383860084738	2016-02-12T03:39:33	davealevine DavidSchawel Totally. No chance in hell of coming true. But that's how it always is.
Jesse_Livermore	697987929646374912	2016-02-12T03:37:45	davealevine DavidSchawel So I'd say that the Nikkei should be falling, if the global economy is going into recession.
Jesse_Livermore	697987717456461826	2016-02-12T03:36:54	davealevine DavidSchawel NKY *Earnings* fundamentals? Will be tied to the global economy and the yen. Hard to be bullish on the former.
Jesse_Livermore	697987241428197376	2016-02-12T03:35:00	davealevine DavidSchawel Yeah, those were from last yr. Here's updated. Even worse: So US not down 10%, down 12%. 
Jesse_Livermore	697986479369289728	2016-02-12T03:31:59	davealevine DavidSchawel Read this thread. Remember? I admit when I'm wrong. But here, I was right. Agree? 
Jesse_Livermore	697986169426980864	2016-02-12T03:30:45	davealevine DavidSchawel What I was arguing to you was that Japan's earnings fundamentals were better than US earnings fundamentals.
Jesse_Livermore	697982946108542976	2016-02-12T03:17:56	davealevine DavidSchawel So no, I don't think your tweets at the time deserve any kind of pat on the back ;-) They were not right.
Jesse_Livermore	697982489940271104	2016-02-12T03:16:08	davealevine DavidSchawel This is abt fear over what will happen to JPN's EPS fundamentals, if global cycle turning. And now yen exploding!
Jesse_Livermore	697982086628544512	2016-02-12T03:14:31	davealevine DavidSchawel We were debating *EPS* fundamentals. Since then, Japan EPS up double digits. US down 10%. 
Jesse_Livermore	697980607339495424	2016-02-12T03:08:39	davealevine DavidSchawel This selloff isn't about JPN's demographics. It's abt Global risk-off, esp China fears. Japan more exposed.
Jesse_Livermore	697979735150735360	2016-02-12T03:05:11	davealevine DavidSchawel Japan demographics still awful, but not energy! They couldn't possibly be in a better place on that front...
Jesse_Livermore	697979462114086913	2016-02-12T03:04:06	davealevine DavidSchawel The JPN fundamentals that 2014 Dave was worried abt was demogr and energy production ;-) 
Jesse_Livermore	697978407787765760	2016-02-12T02:59:54	davealevine DavidSchawel Definitely. U've been spot on in ur negativity. Just wanna make sure 2014 Dave isn't coming at me w told ya so's.
Jesse_Livermore	697977753107193858	2016-02-12T02:57:18	davealevine DavidSchawel Cute ;-) Btw, the NKY is *still* winning, even despite the global downturn... 
Jesse_Livermore	697903345856425984	2016-02-11T22:01:38	The bottom line is that a policy that involves taking money *away* from people is not effective stimulus.

Jesse_Livermore	697602581363752960	2016-02-11T02:06:30	haggerskme Yes.

Jesse_Livermore	697295029631479808	2016-02-10T05:44:24	Matt_Wiens I'll have to recheck. It might say "state" rather than territory.
Jesse_Livermore	697294701548843008	2016-02-10T05:43:06	Matt_Wiens Question was, are Fannie/Freddie paper obligations of the US government? Fed said yes, but probably wrong. No one challenged tho
Jesse_Livermore	697294567679221760	2016-02-10T05:42:34	Matt_Wiens Fed can only buy obligations of the US government, and muni bonds of short duration (and a few other things).
Jesse_Livermore	697294316247470081	2016-02-10T05:41:34	Matt_Wiens No, only the US. Allowable Fed asset purchases are prescribed in the Federeal Reserve Act...
Jesse_Livermore	697293158871224320	2016-02-10T05:36:58	haggerskme I think the effect of flooding the world with new yen would far outweigh.
Jesse_Livermore	697292942638067712	2016-02-10T05:36:07	Matt_Wiens Yep, but the Fed can't do that. Illegal.
Jesse_Livermore	697292521261518848	2016-02-10T05:34:26	OIL.JPY would rise, increase expected inflation. Yen would crater. Oil strength would restore global E&amp;P investment. And mkts would explode.

Jesse_Livermore	697290029337432064	2016-02-10T05:24:32	Imagine if BOJ had a clandestine QE oil-buying program.  Build their own massive reserve for defense purposes. Depreciate the yen.
Jesse_Livermore	697289613249908736	2016-02-10T05:22:53	The most bullish possible thing the BOJ could have done: print yen, buy oil!  Mkts would have exploded.
Jesse_Livermore	697289278913548288	2016-02-10T05:21:33	Matt_Wiens Yes, I'm not advocating it. Just seems mkt likes QE more. Maybe just a coincidence, b/c NIRP now being used late in cycle.
Jesse_Livermore	697289042514194432	2016-02-10T05:20:37	Matt_Wiens Yes. But not as much as NIRP, I would think, especially when you have massive outstanding reserves.
Jesse_Livermore	697287847003303940	2016-02-10T05:15:52	cullenroche Austerity_Sucks However, QE puts buy flow, also shrinks asset supply, which can boost price, create cap gain. But not NIRP.
Jesse_Livermore	697287554345730048	2016-02-10T05:14:42	cullenroche Austerity_Sucks Of course, QE also a fiscal tightening--removes the asset, therefore removes the interest income...
Jesse_Livermore	697287402948153346	2016-02-10T05:14:06	cullenroche Austerity_Sucks It's also a more direct fiscal tightening.
Jesse_Livermore	697287340255907841	2016-02-10T05:13:51	cullenroche Austerity_Sucks The assumption is they can pass on the costs to customers. And that's not a given.
Jesse_Livermore	697287170684420097	2016-02-10T05:13:11	cullenroche Austerity_Sucks Seems that NIRP is more risky wrt unintended consequences on an increasingly unprofitable banking system.
Jesse_Livermore	697286971115180032	2016-02-10T05:12:23	cullenroche Austerity_Sucks But I think there are reasons why NIRP might be different than QE, even in terms of how mkt receives it.
Jesse_Livermore	697286886251847681	2016-02-10T05:12:03	cullenroche Austerity_Sucks I agree. Efficacy of QE massively exaggerated.
Jesse_Livermore	697286276517466113	2016-02-10T05:09:37	DavidSchawel Agreed. Risk is that the mkt is going to realize QE's efficacy was wildly exaggerated just as US enters a mild recession...
Jesse_Livermore	697285596721459201	2016-02-10T05:06:55	ldaalder Where did it rise 10%?  The rise happened in January 15, 6 months after NIRP, when QE was announced.
Jesse_Livermore	697285381125853184	2016-02-10T05:06:04	DavidSchawel I agree, none of it is going to do much to boost demand. Maybe mkt is coming to that realization, just as NIRP is beginning.
Jesse_Livermore	697285072076976129	2016-02-10T05:04:50	DavidSchawel Good points.
Jesse_Livermore	697284701828984832	2016-02-10T05:03:22	ldaalder ECB went negative in Summer '14.  Stocks were flat until Jan '15, when QE was announced. 
Jesse_Livermore	697282790237171712	2016-02-10T04:55:46	Tomrgrey actually, I think they thought negative rates would help depreciate the yen, especially relative to the euro.
Jesse_Livermore	697281647507431424	2016-02-10T04:51:14	My guess: if BOJ had opted to massively increase purchases of stox &amp; junk bonds, instead of neg rates, response would have been much better.
Jesse_Livermore	697281234922176512	2016-02-10T04:49:35	I think mkt is telling us something: QE is bullish, but negative interest rates are not.

Jesse_Livermore	695840559550767105	2016-02-06T05:24:52	SmallCapLS Now, if productivity increases--we make more stuff with the same # of people, then everyone can benefit. But not otherwise.
Jesse_Livermore	695840288388960256	2016-02-06T05:23:47	SmallCapLS if we're focusing on profits, it's a wash. there's a windfall to consumers, but it comes out of the corporate balance.
Jesse_Livermore	695833335050842112	2016-02-06T04:56:09	The bullish story on higher wages is that the windfall will boost household spending. But wasn't that the bullish story on lower oil prices?
Jesse_Livermore	695831076980203520	2016-02-06T04:47:11	PlanMaestro ah, nice.
Jesse_Livermore	695830243093848068	2016-02-06T04:43:52	Good job/wage growth, w/ weak output/sales growth, coming off record margins, is bearish. Makes total sense for mkt to be weighed down here.

Jesse_Livermore	695517185796472832	2016-02-05T07:59:53	ivaneeljankovic agurevich23 inner_scorecard I don't see those producing kind of fear needed to get people to sell this down below ~1650.

Jesse_Livermore	695500610574004225	2016-02-05T06:54:01	agurevich23 Best case is mkt sees light at end of tunnel, regains its footing, we go back to highs, bottom already in. Makes this so hard.
Jesse_Livermore	695500184617234432	2016-02-05T06:52:20	agurevich23 Me too. I don't like the price action at all. But at most, I see only a very shallow recession, 20% correction. Worst case.
Jesse_Livermore	695499378874675201	2016-02-05T06:49:08	agurevich23 inner_scorecard But to be honest, I don't expect anything like 2008-type scenario here. Just more of this directionless slog.
Jesse_Livermore	695499228722823168	2016-02-05T06:48:32	agurevich23 Won't be able to sell it at fair price in a 2008 scenario, so lose that optionality, to take adv of other opptys.
Jesse_Livermore	695498991308566528	2016-02-05T06:47:35	agurevich23 inner_scorecard No, and that's definitely a drawback.
Jesse_Livermore	695498077373800448	2016-02-05T06:43:58	agurevich23 Makes sense. Do you have a view on US equities right now?
Jesse_Livermore	695497560471961601	2016-02-05T06:41:54	.gaurang_m Yes, but all developed economies will eventually exhibit deteriorating demographics, IMO. Development means less reproduction.
Jesse_Livermore	695493692354768896	2016-02-05T06:26:32	jameskostohryz Agreed, especially in this increasingly efficient mkt we live in. It probably will only get worse.

Jesse_Livermore	695487389167255552	2016-02-05T06:01:29	agurevich23 inner_scorecard One area I kind of like is preferred stocks.
Jesse_Livermore	695487013726789632	2016-02-05T06:00:00	agurevich23 inner_scorecard Right, and you nailed that. That's what I want--those kinds of trades. And they aren't there.
Jesse_Livermore	695486179114774528	2016-02-05T05:56:41	agurevich23 We could be 50 bps on 10s. Will still satisfy contrarian impulse to say no, going to 0, neg. But will it be a compelling trade?

Jesse_Livermore	695485134376546304	2016-02-05T05:52:32	agurevich23 inner_scorecard IMO, macro types find the trade sexy because it's so contrarian. But that doesn't make it a compelling trade.
Jesse_Livermore	695484844529201152	2016-02-05T05:51:23	agurevich23 inner_scorecard But is it worth it?  Is it something to get excited about?
Jesse_Livermore	695484749817597952	2016-02-05T05:51:00	agurevich23 inner_scorecard Look, I can't deny that there's probably still some juice left in the trade.
Jesse_Livermore	695484523312607232	2016-02-05T05:50:06	quantian1 Fiscal. Anything involving central bank losses is fiscal imo. Includes CB asset purchases where CB buys assets at implied loss.
Jesse_Livermore	695483714491383808	2016-02-05T05:46:53	The following pt will one day be obvious: modern, developed economies cannot maintain output and employment w/o *continual* fiscal stimulus.
Jesse_Livermore	695482589017026561	2016-02-05T05:42:25	agurevich23 inner_scorecard I don't dispute that we have a low rate future. But the market doesn't either. That's the problem.
Jesse_Livermore	695482374604218368	2016-02-05T05:41:34	agurevich23 inner_scorecard Which gets to my pt, then and now--what's the r/r in that trade? Is it really worth screwing with?
Jesse_Livermore	695482124799856640	2016-02-05T05:40:34	agurevich23 inner_scorecard We did ;-) And it's not clear that long bonds then was a good trade. TLT bottomed $115 by the summer...
Jesse_Livermore	695480662065713152	2016-02-05T05:34:45	Endgame for all economies is permanent fiscal nGDP targeting. Gradual realization of monetarism's inefficacy is part of path to get there.
Jesse_Livermore	695478601131495427	2016-02-05T05:26:34	Very bearish to see Nikkei and yen where they are right now. Just a total rejection of everything that the BOJ has done in the last week.

Jesse_Livermore	695477813768429568	2016-02-05T05:23:26	inner_scorecard Long bonds, *here*? There's a lot of ways you can lose money very quickly, without long rates even going that much higher.

Jesse_Livermore	695474450741878784	2016-02-05T05:10:05	davealevine TheStalwart That base is physical extension of US. Eg, if commit a crime on it, tried under U.S. Federal jurisdiction.
Jesse_Livermore	695474203349266433	2016-02-05T05:09:06	davealevine TheStalwart But McCain is different. He was born in a U.S. military hospital at Coco Solo, U.S. territory for legal purposes.

Jesse_Livermore	695472883284324352	2016-02-05T05:03:51	TheStalwart Well said. Also, maybe we need someone like him to come together against. All groups. A common person to be "the" problem.
Jesse_Livermore	695472388071227392	2016-02-05T05:01:53	TheStalwart What about the birther issue? I can see a credible legal challenge to a Cruz presidency. You?
Jesse_Livermore	695472223474221056	2016-02-05T05:01:13	TheStalwart No, it's a very interesting angle. I'll have to think more about that.
Jesse_Livermore	695471813401321472	2016-02-05T04:59:36	TheStalwart It would be like a bad joke--ie, what the hell just happened?
Jesse_Livermore	695471683688230912	2016-02-05T04:59:05	TheStalwart I agree he has talent--a special type. But I don't see how the mainstream could take a Cruz presidency seriously.

Jesse_Livermore	692927232084426752	2016-01-29T04:28:20	davealevine I guess. It's definitely a break. In the future, we may look back at it as a critical shift.

Jesse_Livermore	691855095387066371	2016-01-26T05:28:03	TheArmoTrader Imports free up our labor and capital for better endeavors, but we  have an excess to begin with. Which is unlikely to close.
Jesse_Livermore	691854870425509889	2016-01-26T05:27:09	TheArmoTrader Saudis could exploit that.  Oil dependency not as dangerous, but I see no reason for us to import. What value does it add?
Jesse_Livermore	691854557454974976	2016-01-26T05:25:55	TheArmoTrader but it would create an undesirable vulnerability to another country, given that we can't bring back our industry immediately.
Jesse_Livermore	691854338776514561	2016-01-26T05:25:03	TheArmoTrader In a pure capitalist system, would be good to let our producers fail, so that labor and capital can go to more useful places.
Jesse_Livermore	691854169586716675	2016-01-26T05:24:22	TheArmoTrader imagine if we bought all of our military equipment from Saudi, b/c they were lowest cost producer. Out-competed our producers
Jesse_Livermore	691853953366151168	2016-01-26T05:23:31	TheArmoTrader b/c it serves important national security interests to have it, and not be dependent on other countries for a vital resource.
Jesse_Livermore	691852510798168064	2016-01-26T05:17:47	TheArmoTrader the goal would b to maintain domestic E&amp;P investment, prevent it from drying up, creating a future vulnerability.
Jesse_Livermore	691851440084615169	2016-01-26T05:13:31	TheArmoTrader good point.

Jesse_Livermore	689220478318153729	2016-01-18T22:59:01	choffstein great idea. don't have access to a long enough time series.  you have? would be interesting to see the results.
Jesse_Livermore	689220388182568960	2016-01-18T22:58:40	choffstein true, but those seem to produce whipsaws more than captured downturns. Look at the current cycle.
Jesse_Livermore	689220255491555329	2016-01-18T22:58:08	choffstein So hard to get a legit, independent out of sample test. I acknowledge, makes it hard to b a believer. I'm not even saying I am.
Jesse_Livermore	689219930189766656	2016-01-18T22:56:51	choffstein Their mkts tend to go up and down depending on what's happening in US economy, not so much their own economies.
Jesse_Livermore	689219822350012417	2016-01-18T22:56:25	choffstein Moreover, *our* recessions predict their price downturns, not their recessions.
Jesse_Livermore	689219657006333953	2016-01-18T22:55:45	choffstein The retail sales and IP data in foreign mkts is extremely messy and erratic. Very non-specific, always flashing negative.
Jesse_Livermore	689219310636564482	2016-01-18T22:54:23	choffstein however... it only works in foreign markets if you use U.S. economic data. i.e., time those mkts on U.S. recessions.
Jesse_Livermore	689219141316677633	2016-01-18T22:53:43	choffstein it works in that. which is good.
Jesse_Livermore	689219113885941760	2016-01-18T22:53:36	choffstein so, e.g,. take daily total US mkt index, and randomly pick dates every 25-35 days, to form a pseudo-monthly index.
Jesse_Livermore	689218969270530048	2016-01-18T22:53:02	choffstein it also works in randomly generated u.s total market indices.
Jesse_Livermore	689218793168502784	2016-01-18T22:52:20	choffstein it works well in sectors, industries, junk credits, and individual equity names.
Jesse_Livermore	689218445133524992	2016-01-18T22:50:57	choffstein ah, but don't steal my thunder ;-)
Jesse_Livermore	689218268779773952	2016-01-18T22:50:14	choffstein definitely a risk, for sure. but how can you time correctly and avoid? have to look at the past.

Jesse_Livermore	689216794301562880	2016-01-18T22:44:23	zenotrend There's also noise, false negatives, in the signals--GTT modulates, b/c only acts if the noise coincides with downtrend--low odds
Jesse_Livermore	689216586066964481	2016-01-18T22:43:33	zenotrend Doesn't hurt GTT because it respects bullish price trend no matter what, gets in regardless of what signals are saying.

Jesse_Livermore	679861590955458560	2015-12-24T03:10:09	georgepearkes Had a typo there, here it is corrected: 
Jesse_Livermore	679850779532902402	2015-12-24T02:27:11	georgepearkes I tried to briefly summarize it all w/ this, probly should have gone deeper: 
Jesse_Livermore	679850517174996992	2015-12-24T02:26:08	georgepearkes Can't go on forever, some momo players will eventually jump ship, create downward momo, and break the positive fback loop.
Jesse_Livermore	679850316062306304	2015-12-24T02:25:21	georgepearkes In reality, this process will have to somehow become unstable and break down in a crash.
Jesse_Livermore	679850212974673920	2015-12-24T02:24:56	georgepearkes In that case, the price will go way past FV, into a bubble, and in theory, to infinity.
Jesse_Livermore	679850016861622273	2015-12-24T02:24:09	georgepearkes Other possibility is momentum becomes so popular that momentum players become the majority of participants, &amp; set the price.
Jesse_Livermore	679849878923509760	2015-12-24T02:23:36	georgepearkes So that's 1 possiblty: fundy crowd controls price, momo arbitrages their underrxn, effect saturates as more momo players join
Jesse_Livermore	679849305000128513	2015-12-24T02:21:19	georgepearkes Put differently, there will be more momentm players trying to arbitrage away the underreaction, and so it won't last as long.
Jesse_Livermore	679849207360958464	2015-12-24T02:20:56	georgepearkes ...because the price will more quickly get pushed up to the right price, with fewer mom players able to be onboard for that.
Jesse_Livermore	679849074099527680	2015-12-24T02:20:24	georgepearkes But if, in that situation, many people start to practice momentum, its outperformance will saturate/decay because...
Jesse_Livermore	679848950145257473	2015-12-24T02:19:55	georgepearkes Systematic momentum strat would be able to capture the pattern, fundamental crowd going from underreaction--&gt;normal reaction.
Jesse_Livermore	679848569134694400	2015-12-24T02:18:24	georgepearkes Assuming they're doing the work w/ behaviorl biases that cause underreaction to new info, the result will b momentum pattern.
Jesse_Livermore	679848287747215361	2015-12-24T02:17:17	georgepearkes Suppose they're not using any sytematic momentum strat, but just buying/selling based on where they think price should be.
Jesse_Livermore	679847955625426944	2015-12-24T02:15:58	georgepearkes A couple of possibilities.  1st suppose majority of participants, who are setting the price, r doing normal fundamental work,
