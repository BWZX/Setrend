meganmurp	704829344166895616	2016-03-02T00:43:05	To my eye, it looks like Rubio on track to finish within 5% of Trump in VA. But, could be even closer. Still early, we'll see.
meganmurp	704827823123525632	2016-03-02T00:37:02	Totally possible at this hour:  1) Kasich wins Vermont 2) Rubio loses Virginia 3) Pressure increases on Kasich to make way for Rubio
meganmurp	704827669620396033	2016-03-02T00:36:26	Be cautious of Trump's 39%-29% lead in VA so far. Most of that is from western VA, but not a lot of Rubio-friendly Northern Virginia yet.
meganmurp	704826086203510784	2016-03-02T00:30:08	And remember, in VA, the last precincts to report are always in NoVA, which tonight means a late Rubio surge as the count gets closer to end
meganmurp	704826105522425858	2016-03-02T00:30:13	Based on the exit poll, both Cruz and Rubio are barely on the right side of Georgia's 20% statewide delegate threshold right now
meganmurp	704822873500852224	2016-03-02T00:17:22	Based on the data we've seen this evening, it seems conceivable that four different candidates on the GOP side may win a state.
meganmurp	704819210719920128	2016-03-02T00:02:49	The Cruz trolling tomorrow if Kasich wins Vermont and Rubio doesn't win anywhere will be amazing
