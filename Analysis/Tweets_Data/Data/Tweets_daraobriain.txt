daraobriain	725007331902259202	2016-04-26T17:03:12	mauriceoconno16 It was a joke. About consultants forgetting something simple like the code to the mess.

daraobriain	724648197285646336	2016-04-25T17:16:08	elektragogo2013 but now you do know it was a charity gig. So now it's clear that you were being clumsy, isn't it? So why not say sorry?
daraobriain	724647382466629632	2016-04-25T17:12:53	elektragogo2013 Hey, I got no dog in this fight. Just interested why someone being rude online can never just step back and say sorry.
daraobriain	724647116912615424	2016-04-25T17:11:50	elektragogo2013 He should apologise to you for what? Not accepting you being rude? Did that.. hurt you?
daraobriain	724646683544563716	2016-04-25T17:10:07	elektragogo2013 Seriously. If this was face-to-face you'd just apologise for the misjudgement and all is fine. So why not here?
daraobriain	724645944881516544	2016-04-25T17:07:11	elektragogo2013 Sorry for intruding, but it always intrigues me why people online can't just go "sorry!" And let stuff go...

daraobriain	686521419891642370	2016-01-11T12:13:56	It was the realisation that the world was bigger and stranger than I knew, aged 8. Could hardly concentrate on Tomorrow's World afterwards.
daraobriain	686520787667435521	2016-01-11T12:11:25	Just remembering watching Ashes to Ashes video on TOTP aged 8 and having my little mind blown. "What. Universe. Is. This?"
daraobriain	686472967103066112	2016-01-11T09:01:24	MuggeridgePhil RachGarwood Ha! I thought you handled it very well, Steve.
daraobriain	686296132364926977	2016-01-10T21:18:43	RachGarwood Thank you for not putting me in the toilet.
daraobriain	686282881937833984	2016-01-10T20:26:04	Cunninghamkt ProfBrianCox Never. It’s bloody freezing out there.
daraobriain	686282170378403840	2016-01-10T20:23:14	EmStuttx It was very good. And you intercut with Donkey particularly well. A bit early in the morning for “I’m a believer” though...
daraobriain	686249272782766081	2016-01-10T18:12:31	JesseBoheme It was, of course, Shrektacular. And the 7 year old adored it. Thanks!
daraobriain	686247601126174720	2016-01-10T18:05:52	JesseBoheme I thought you excelled darling. You're the best Agnes I've seen, and I've sent them all.

daraobriain	685212378485645317	2016-01-07T21:32:16	An excellent evening at the Reith lecture, sitting next to Alan_Measles, listening to prof Stephen Hawking. On the radio later in January.
daraobriain	685068115085004800	2016-01-07T11:59:01	IanARegan Yes, regularly. I dismissed it. Mainly because I needed xenophobia for the joke...
daraobriain	684732905105547264	2016-01-06T13:47:00	ianmodmoore TheSimonEvans I don't remember that at all. Maybe I was off fighting while you were buying singing reindeer?
daraobriain	684722763165241344	2016-01-06T13:06:42	KindredLikeMe I doubt your style guide was expected to cope with the Irish language! No matter, either capital O or small ó works for me...
daraobriain	684681020109656068	2016-01-06T10:20:50	KindredLikeMe Ha! Very well spotted. Bonus points if you put a little line above the O.

daraobriain	684379368769122304	2016-01-05T14:22:11	zazelamel Ironically, it's "irks". And as for "everyone", that's my accent. Embrace the diversity!
daraobriain	684310515036884992	2016-01-05T09:48:35	al_vimh Still, probably, my favourite show. And it was Twitter that started with the whole tits thing. Hope you enjoy it!
daraobriain	684035701114036224	2016-01-04T15:36:34	Padington_smi Nope.
daraobriain	683592633327968256	2016-01-03T10:15:58	OwensDamien probably better that the settings have gone straight to "beyond parody". Was it for this... Etc etc
daraobriain	683386654623690752	2016-01-02T20:37:29	Jrfbaird that's so true. And now it will bug me more than you can imagine.

daraobriain	683385731729993728	2016-01-02T20:33:49	benmonty4 I think we got away with it! And also nothing happened for 70 minutes in the match, so the pressure was off...
daraobriain	683385472475856896	2016-01-02T20:32:47	Clairekf23 even I think this isn't news. A good yarn, yes, but hardly news.

daraobriain	682992054331392000	2016-01-01T18:29:29	richardosman This entire exercise demonstrates the failure of democracy. All these decisions are wrong.
