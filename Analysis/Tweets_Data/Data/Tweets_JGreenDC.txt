JGreenDC	715603240860127233	2016-03-31T18:14:42	7) So Trump remains the favorite for the nomination, but compared to a month ago, the NeverTrump crowd can actually see a path forward. Fin
JGreenDC	715603015433109505	2016-03-31T18:13:48	6) Because while plenty of Republicans could live with Trump, they won't stomach a loss   
JGreenDC	715602753335111681	2016-03-31T18:12:46	But w/ NateSilver538 and LarrySabato predicting Hillary landslides over Trump, don't be surprised if the anti-Trump cash comes pouring in.
JGreenDC	715602130590167043	2016-03-31T18:10:17	4) And with PA/MD/DE/RI voting later this month, Kasich really needs to catch fire. He's yet to do that.

JGreenDC	715601604943155200	2016-03-31T18:08:12	2) As of this week, that strategy is looking like it might have a first shot, with Trump sagging in Wisconsin 
JGreenDC	715601072929259521	2016-03-31T18:06:05	1) The strategy for non-Trump Republicans is to deny Trump 1,237 delegates. Neither Cruz nor Kasich can win.
