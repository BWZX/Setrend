OrrChris	725890274170429440	2016-04-29T03:31:42	steveking_ Totally agree. The fact that Trump is the prevailing vessel is just the most awful coincidence/irony/what-have-you imaginable.

OrrChris	725788472615821313	2016-04-28T20:47:11	Trump won the bid by making two promises—both of which he backed out of as soon as possible.

OrrChris	717570112417570817	2016-04-06T04:30:21	mattrindge Sanders, from tiny, super-homogenous, very liberal state literally has no clue. Not a stage he is remotely prepared for.

OrrChris	717569437172428800	2016-04-06T04:27:40	mattrindge It may be a truism, but Clinton's (substantial) negatives are already largely baked into the cake.
OrrChris	717569284340322304	2016-04-06T04:27:03	mattrindge Sanders gen election polls mean nothing at this point. Most voters never heard of him 2 mos ago and haven't heard "socialist"
OrrChris	717568573527474176	2016-04-06T04:24:14	mattrindge It's Bernie's great fortune that the insanity on GOP side has prevented anyone from focusing on him as a gen election nominee.
OrrChris	717568367599689728	2016-04-06T04:23:25	mattrindge Because--as much as I acknowledge Clinton as a weak, and depressing nominee--Bernie would be an outright disaster.

OrrChris	717567181354115072	2016-04-06T04:18:42	mattrindge As a film-lover, let me express that a) this isn't the movie where Bernie wins; and b) if it were it'd ultimately be a tragedy.

OrrChris	696937035236511746	2016-02-09T06:01:52	OrrChris jpodhoretz there's a catch in his voice when he realises here's embarked upon the same sentence all over again.

OrrChris	696934842467033088	2016-02-09T05:53:09	jpodhoretz A fair amount, though I confess not all of it. Do you think it would alter my impression of that clearly inadvertent repetition?
OrrChris	696932731268263936	2016-02-09T05:44:46	jpodhoretz Watched again. Hard to imagine anything farther from rhythmic, deliberate anaphora than this careless, accidental repetition.
OrrChris	696921203177607168	2016-02-09T04:58:57	And as long as I'm on the subject, let me offer a vote for Synecdoche, NY as among most underrated films of decade: 
OrrChris	696919716070301699	2016-02-09T04:53:03	jpodhoretz (2/2) In hindsight, I suspect (unintentional) synecdoche will be more useful lens than (intentional) anaphora. Rubio
OrrChris	696919257494511616	2016-02-09T04:51:13	jpodhoretz Synecdoche is a capacious term, and in no way something Rubio would be "guilty" of, but something projected upon him. (1/2)
OrrChris	696917021183905792	2016-02-09T04:42:20	Alternatively: synecdoche, in which robotic repetition serves as a representation of the entire Rubio campaign.

OrrChris	696785073840988164	2016-02-08T19:58:01	Also, DouthatNYT is definitely onto something when he detects an allegory for the Church. Like it, the studio tells sustaining fables (1/2)

OrrChris	695655363811663873	2016-02-05T17:08:58	thisbrokenwheel Peculiar. Coens' treatment--in which he uses it for locks, guns for killing--is vastly more sensible.

OrrChris	695653627059433472	2016-02-05T17:02:03	.AlexParkerDC AnnHornaday Agree completely. But it's a lousy murder weapon, given that its effective range is about 5 inches.
OrrChris	695653285454356481	2016-02-05T17:00:42	And, uh, yeah: in that 2nd of 3 tweets, I meant "guns," not "gubs". Some weird "Take the Money and Run" reflex...
OrrChris	695652795723051009	2016-02-05T16:58:45	IChotiner Nope. Blows out the lock and then shoots them. (Cattle gun, after all, only has an effective range of about 5 inches.)
OrrChris	695652187448467456	2016-02-05T16:56:20	(3/3) Might equally accurate describe Chigurh as a villain who "goes around strangling people with handcuffs."  AnnHornaday
OrrChris	695652004853637122	2016-02-05T16:55:37	(2/3) Chigurh kills a dozen or more through conventional means (mostly gubs). The cattle gun is used principally for blowing out locks...
OrrChris	695651790193356800	2016-02-05T16:54:46	Remarkably, AnnHornaday continues to maintain that NCFOM's Anton Chigurh kills "people"--as opposed to *one person* with cattle gun (1/3)
