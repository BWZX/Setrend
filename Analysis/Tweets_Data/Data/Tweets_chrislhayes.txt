chrislhayes	726083198107656193	2016-04-29T16:18:19	JAMyerson YousefMunayyer true. that's a political calculation. I think ignoring Bernie's supporters is a bad idea, politically. But you

chrislhayes	726082682237628418	2016-04-29T16:16:16	YousefMunayyer JAMyerson sure, but a win's a win in a democracy. You win by one vote you get it all. That's how elections work.

chrislhayes	726078784089260032	2016-04-29T16:00:46	JAMyerson There's no way that's the thinking here. The thinking is simply: I won, i control the platform.

chrislhayes	725356541646352385	2016-04-27T16:10:50	Seriously: did Hastert just stop doing this when he became a politician?
chrislhayes	725354359542919168	2016-04-27T16:02:10	Judge directly asks Hastert if he sexually abused victims. At Stephen Reinbolt, Hastert pauses: "yes" Jolene Burdge breaks into sobs.

chrislhayes	725342348964671490	2016-04-27T15:14:26	I'm convinced a big part of what makes Trump so bizarre is that he literally never reads anything and gets all his information from TV.

chrislhayes	725157579589079041	2016-04-27T03:00:14	AlecMacGillis dansheehan and perfectly functional markets sometime produce really bad externalities.
chrislhayes	725157440556269569	2016-04-27T02:59:41	AlecMacGillis dansheehan totally agree. It's the inexorable gravity of ratings, clicks, shares and eyeballs in a very competitive market.

chrislhayes	725155773681143814	2016-04-27T02:53:03	AlecMacGillis dansheehan the presidential campaign has kind of pushed everything to the margins. I agree it's a very important story

chrislhayes	725147431449579520	2016-04-27T02:19:54	If Trump had to discipline to focus on this line: trade, wages, economic development, it would sell pretty damn well in the general.
chrislhayes	725146706292166656	2016-04-27T02:17:02	Christie can't help but smile at Trump's "I'm a very smart person" line.

chrislhayes	724999800857452544	2016-04-26T16:33:17	joanwalsh there were definitely no substantive or policy preconditions, as has been alluded to by Sanders. But they did negotiate.
chrislhayes	724999680225099776	2016-04-26T16:32:48	joanwalsh The idea of no preconditions isn't true, though. There were negotiations over fundraising help to get rid of campaign debt.

chrislhayes	722990373576937472	2016-04-21T03:28:32	dankberning because I was quoting the campaign.
chrislhayes	722989716929273856	2016-04-21T03:25:55	I agree. Primaries are over June 7th, and I think it would be great if voters in all states get to make their choice 
chrislhayes	722988015983816704	2016-04-21T03:19:10	fmanjoo SarahNEmerson I'm confused. Is this for, like, malarial hotel rooms?

chrislhayes	722961466454884352	2016-04-21T01:33:40	"Less" has fewer letters than "fewer", making it useful for Twitter.
chrislhayes	722961123230814208	2016-04-21T01:32:18	And it's preposterous under the campaign's *own* theory of change -- which calls for mobilization &amp; involvement against the "establishment"
chrislhayes	722960608036003845	2016-04-21T01:30:15	The idea that Bernie Sanders would get less pledged delegates and less votes and be the Democratic nominee is, frankly, preposterous.
chrislhayes	722958212245401600	2016-04-21T01:20:44	quietoutbursts thanks. I really appreciate this feedback.
chrislhayes	722953454931484672	2016-04-21T01:01:50	JMcClain_OSU right, but if the rules were such that no outright *vote* majority threw it to the House, it would've been shocking

chrislhayes	722923923466092544	2016-04-20T23:04:29	I'm trying to de-link them. NY voting administration and laws are not good, and should be fixed, independent of their effect on outcomes
chrislhayes	722923745766039552	2016-04-20T23:03:46	No, my point is the opposite. Somehow the problems w/ NY voting have become inextricably bound to the outcome  
chrislhayes	722923592862666754	2016-04-20T23:03:10	JordanChariton polling and demographic models.
chrislhayes	722923551364222977	2016-04-20T23:03:00	JordanChariton also, the question of who won doesn't really matter so each marginal vote matters on its own. Still, HRC performance tracked
chrislhayes	722923232425213952	2016-04-20T23:01:44	JordanChariton I suppose that's too definitive for an inherently unknowable counterfactual, but HRC won by almost 300k votes.

chrislhayes	714625423603331072	2016-03-29T01:29:12	seanwilson160 yeah, I agree. Coverage itself conditions demand. *But* there's a huge collective action problem in a competitive environment

chrislhayes	713176163032629249	2016-03-25T01:30:22	McSnewsie I hear you. In my (perhaps) defense I do a lot of cutting off of male guests too, driven by time constraints of live TV.
chrislhayes	713171374907465729	2016-03-25T01:11:20	As chrislhayes demonstrated, county election officials freed from Section 5 are free to just guess in determining polling places needed.
chrislhayes	713166478359576576	2016-03-25T00:51:53	danjnj more or less. I still don't understand the particulars of how they miscalculated so widely. But yeah.

chrislhayes	710579223627440128	2016-03-17T21:31:03	5) all these state rules mean *nothing* if that committee decides they mean nothing. So: it you want this nomination, your goal
chrislhayes	710579112331583490	2016-03-17T21:30:36	4) Those conventions haven't happened, so that committee doesn't exist yet. But it's that committee, the convention rules com, that matters
chrislhayes	710578757963223041	2016-03-17T21:29:12	3) That committee comprises 2 dels from each state. Those dels are elected as their state's rep to the rules committee at state convention.
chrislhayes	710578447534440449	2016-03-17T21:27:58	2) But "the rules" aren't set yet! The actual rules for the convention will be set by the convention rules committee.
chrislhayes	710578336276340736	2016-03-17T21:27:31	1) OK, so I've been thinking about this contested convention talk and here's a thought. Everyone's talking about "the rules"

chrislhayes	710109596589776896	2016-03-16T14:24:55	Garland makes NO sense if you're thinking in terms of , "who would GOP pay highest political price for blocking" in November.
chrislhayes	710109448740556800	2016-03-16T14:24:20	if you consider all three of those, particularly c) then Garland makes some sense
chrislhayes	710109149934133248	2016-03-16T14:23:09	b) who can get confirmed (broadly respected, over 60) c) who would e least adversely affected by nasty,drawn out unsuccessful process.
chrislhayes	710108494439927809	2016-03-16T14:20:32	I honestly think there was not a lot of election-year consideration put into this pick. It's a) who do they want on the court
chrislhayes	710107974996332544	2016-03-16T14:18:29	Finally, Merrick is a dope name. Don't lose sight of that. (Although so is Sri Srinivasan)
chrislhayes	710107305115656193	2016-03-16T14:15:49	I'm friends with a number of Garland's former clerks, who have *tremendous* respect, admiration and affection for him.
chrislhayes	710107037909147648	2016-03-16T14:14:45	On the other hand, the thinking could be it's *more* likely to get old nominee confirmed. That there was NO WAY GOP would confirm 49yo
chrislhayes	710106664716804097	2016-03-16T14:13:16	But given his age, there's considerably less downside to him having a torturous and ultimately unsuccessful nominating process.
chrislhayes	710106281642565632	2016-03-16T14:11:45	Garland is, of course, *massively* well-respected. One of the top, if not *the* top "feeder judge" of clerks up to SCOTUS.
chrislhayes	710105149470023680	2016-03-16T14:07:15	Knee-jerk response to Garland nom is that it's tacit acknowledgment nom prob won't get vote and don't want to damage younger goods.
chrislhayes	710104442973122560	2016-03-16T14:04:26	dylanmatt of its Garland I think it's a concession that the nominee is not actually gonna get a vote.

chrislhayes	708473090129399809	2016-03-12T02:02:02	4) And remember Nixon had Wallace to play the role of Trump, which made it very easy to position himself as reasonable.
chrislhayes	708472544630841344	2016-03-12T01:59:52	3) Trump is now implementing this same strategy, updated for the times, but doesn't seem to realize he has the far smaller half.

chrislhayes	707792264131547137	2016-03-10T04:56:40	mattyglesias agreed
chrislhayes	707791037155049472	2016-03-10T04:51:48	NateSilver538 my follow up about Trump kind of got to that..
chrislhayes	707790219148435457	2016-03-10T04:48:33	There are reasonable arguments for superdelegates but this by DWStweets is ahistorical and disingenuous. 
chrislhayes	707786969779023872	2016-03-10T04:35:38	Why do superdelegates exist? DWStweets gives chrislhayes her explanation inners

chrislhayes	707769667499200516	2016-03-10T03:26:53	Interesting hat tip to the fact checkers from Bernie: who now says he was on the committee that helped write the ACA.
chrislhayes	707769444089647104	2016-03-10T03:25:59	JenGranholm but it's not *false*.
chrislhayes	707769403237134336	2016-03-10T03:25:50	JenGranholm fair enough. I just think it's a somewhat misleading framing of that vote. A vote I was covering very closely at the time.
chrislhayes	707769125502849024	2016-03-10T03:24:43	ryangrim JenGranholm you're saying by my logic?
chrislhayes	707768813278904320	2016-03-10T03:23:29	JenGranholm TARP II definitely more concrete and discussion of auto-bailout as part of it. But also basically zero congressional control
chrislhayes	707768620693065728	2016-03-10T03:22:43	JenGranholm that's fair. Although,we had basically no idea what they would do with that money! (Part of the reason people voted against it)
chrislhayes	707768471099203584	2016-03-10T03:22:07	JenGranholm but it's the same money. The money that bailed out autos came from TARP. If no TARP, then no auto-rescue.
chrislhayes	706308466143399937	2016-03-06T02:40:35	My Mom finally got a smart phone and started texting for the first time.  I guess this is my life now. 
chrislhayes	707767887226904576	2016-03-10T03:19:48	JenGranholm if original TARP doesn't pass, then no auto-bailout, but that logic, right?
chrislhayes	707767621383548928	2016-03-10T03:18:45	JenGranholm right, the logic here is "but...for." HRC sez: if everyone voted like BS, not auto bailout. True for Stabenow TARP vote.

chrislhayes	707763062821036032	2016-03-10T03:00:38	mattyglesias agreed. and that was a genuinely tough and complicated vote.
chrislhayes	707762508594094081	2016-03-10T02:58:26	LeoneTracy yes, but that was a different vote than the TARP II release of funds.

chrislhayes	707761777942126592	2016-03-10T02:55:32	jamespoulos TPCarney jimantle michaelbd different ways to deal with that, but that seems the starting point.

chrislhayes	707761272620752897	2016-03-10T02:53:31	mtracey yeah, but I still don't get this vote. Do you? Like: what was the upside there? How was it understood at the time.
chrislhayes	707761094325043202	2016-03-10T02:52:49	michaelbd jimantle we'd love to have you.

chrislhayes	707760279086637056	2016-03-10T02:49:34	...sense it was a blank check. The message was: we need the money, trust us.
chrislhayes	707759794036330496	2016-03-10T02:47:39	there was definitely a lot of people calling for it to bail out GMAC and other finance arms of the automakers...But in an almost literal...
chrislhayes	707759655951409152	2016-03-10T02:47:06	that the FIRST priority of POTUS was getting approval for the second tranche. But! I was *deeply* unclear what the money would go for...
chrislhayes	707759519259041793	2016-03-10T02:46:33	Context for the TARP II vote. The first tranche had apparently worked. The deep deep panic had subsided. Rahm said before inauguration...

chrislhayes	707757526696267777	2016-03-10T02:38:38	Also interesting that this is a place where Sanders can actually *score* points on separation from Obama.
chrislhayes	707757263537225728	2016-03-10T02:37:35	HRC is correct that the asylum process is distinct. Also, though, the "due process" there is a fricking joke 
chrislhayes	707756862465179650	2016-03-10T02:36:00	Interesting. Daylight between Hillary Clinton and Obama. A veiled shot at POTUS on deportation.

chrislhayes	704908940010725376	2016-03-02T05:59:22	OK, upon further review, seems like Trump basically performed about what was projected.
chrislhayes	704908072406401025	2016-03-02T05:55:55	NickBaumann OCValues Redistrict right. That's what I thought.
