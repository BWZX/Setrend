flocktard	696860886129123328	2016-02-09T00:59:16	DRoberts556 Bullshit. You facilitated unfettered availability and caused the deaths of tens of thousands of innocent Americans,
flocktard	696860629697761280	2016-02-09T00:58:15	DRoberts556 No, ease of attainment made it so. There were no constraints on purchases. These may as well have been Hershey bars.
flocktard	696860427159015426	2016-02-09T00:57:27	DRoberts556 So a sick minority of gun fetishists like you decided "fuck everyone else, I have rights." And so our kids get mowed down
flocktard	696860231138177024	2016-02-09T00:56:40	DRoberts556 But yo u never cared about the effects these practices would have on the rest of the country
flocktard	696860115249537024	2016-02-09T00:56:13	DRoberts556 You fuckers made it so easy to buy a gun, or get enough ammo to feed a battalion, we have a big fucking problem now.
flocktard	696859933640433665	2016-02-09T00:55:29	DRoberts556 Except you guys never made this a choice for everyone else. What YOU people did was make gun distribution widespread

flocktard	696859478457765888	2016-02-09T00:53:41	DRoberts556 Except there's a couple of problems: 1) the odds of you getting raided are still low2) the odds of the gun being of any use low

flocktard	696858583552679936	2016-02-09T00:50:07	DRoberts556 Um, your profile would seem to indicate some.........bias.
flocktard	696858284049960960	2016-02-09T00:48:56	DRoberts556 OK, that's an answer. I presume you don't live in Camden or patrol AC anymore, amirite?
flocktard	696858107322966016	2016-02-09T00:48:14	DRoberts556 You spent 120 years validating your prejudices, which is what most people do when the facts interfere with reality.
flocktard	696857954394513408	2016-02-09T00:47:37	DRoberts556 Were you a cop?

flocktard	696857709023510528	2016-02-09T00:46:39	DRoberts556 You were a cop?
flocktard	696857633551159296	2016-02-09T00:46:21	DRoberts556 It's not a "right" in the way you interpret it. You don;'t have a right to facilitate terrorizing your fellow citizens
flocktard	696857425270411265	2016-02-09T00:45:31	DRoberts556 Those ARE flawed studies, and the evidence doesn't bear you out,. But again this isn't about crime, is it?
flocktard	696857238338715648	2016-02-09T00:44:47	DRoberts556 But everyone I've ever known with a gun was obsessed with it. Especially when they carried.
flocktard	696857116590632960	2016-02-09T00:44:18	DRoberts556 I mean, I worked in some of the toughest area in NYC, when the city was REAL rough, and I never saw a need to pack myself.
flocktard	696856954765996032	2016-02-09T00:43:39	DRoberts556 No, that's wrong, and secondly, you're deflecting. This isn't about "protection" at all, is it?
flocktard	696856725098516480	2016-02-09T00:42:44	DRoberts556 No, your twitter feed seems to be rather one minded.
flocktard	696856616445046784	2016-02-09T00:42:18	DRoberts556 UH- huh. But you chose firearms and a group that advocates armed sedition to announce yourself to the world
flocktard	696856430536736769	2016-02-09T00:41:34	DRoberts556 Why not? Odds of being killed in a car are just as great as being killed with a gun-often your own. Strange.....
flocktard	696856222780284928	2016-02-09T00:40:45	DRoberts556 I'm not deflecting anything, I keep a fire extinguisher in my kitchen. But I'm not crazy about fire extinguishers.
flocktard	696855918512832514	2016-02-09T00:39:32	DRoberts556 Why would someone concerned about mere "precaution" be so obsessed with a tool of it?
flocktard	696855753303449600	2016-02-09T00:38:53	DRoberts556 But you keep insisting this is for the mere utility of "protection." Like buckling up, or driving sober. Yet, no symbols
flocktard	696855525485604864	2016-02-09T00:37:58	DRoberts556 No fire hoses or extinguishers either. How come?
flocktard	696855322376478720	2016-02-09T00:37:10	DRoberts556 No, I'm an American
flocktard	696855248154030080	2016-02-09T00:36:52	DRoberts556 I see. But your avatar/profile is strangely devoid of any images of seatbelts or airbags. Why is that?
flocktard	696855058005299200	2016-02-09T00:36:07	DRoberts556 And whaadya know, you're a 3 percenter too.
flocktard	696854468848193537	2016-02-09T00:33:46	DRoberts556 Let's stick to the issue: how often do you expect to be victimized by a crime?
flocktard	696854087548141570	2016-02-09T00:32:16	DRoberts556 Pauline Kael? WTF?
flocktard	696853920329699328	2016-02-09T00:31:36	DRoberts556 I am aware of this. How often do you expect this to happen to you?
flocktard	696849594173517824	2016-02-09T00:14:24	DRoberts556 So let's dispense with that rubbish, and go to the first question: how often do you expect to be victimized in a crime?
flocktard	696849406059012096	2016-02-09T00:13:39	DRoberts556 In fact, I don't know any cops who want armed amateurs defusing a hot situation on the street.
flocktard	696849049362817024	2016-02-09T00:12:14	DRoberts556 and... 
flocktard	696848124283908096	2016-02-09T00:08:34	DRoberts556 About the "100% of Florida sheriffs" support Stand Your Ground.  Of course, it's false. 
flocktard	696847093349138432	2016-02-09T00:04:28	DRoberts556 You're worried about protecting yourself, right? How often do you expect to be victimized by a crime?
flocktard	696846937421672449	2016-02-09T00:03:51	DRoberts556 Thank you for the canned, suspect responses you saved on your hard drive. Now let me try to understand you.
flocktard	696839781624455168	2016-02-08T23:35:25	DRoberts556 BBL.
flocktard	696839752574705664	2016-02-08T23:35:18	DRoberts556 False equivalence. Seat belts don't hurt 3 year olds when they find them. Or a lot of OTHER accidents,
flocktard	696839534902910978	2016-02-08T23:34:26	DRoberts556 You're 300% more likely to hurt yourself or a family member by owning a gun, than by defending yourself.
flocktard	696839319789694977	2016-02-08T23:33:35	DRoberts556 and there's no correlation between gun ownership and crime rates.
flocktard	696839219415748608	2016-02-08T23:33:11	DRoberts556 No, gun ownership is DOWN. Used to be 50% of US population owned guns. Mow only 33% and dropping.
flocktard	696839042403586048	2016-02-08T23:32:29	DRoberts556 Is that right?  You expect this to happen to you, huh? No matter how remote the chances?
flocktard	696838908542382080	2016-02-08T23:31:57	DRoberts556 Ever watch Bluebloods, Elementary,or Law and Order? They're all filmed in Manhattan. There are more murders on TV than the city
flocktard	696838602333016064	2016-02-08T23:30:44	DRoberts556 You're aware crime rates have plummeted in the past 20 years or so?
flocktard	696838438599979009	2016-02-08T23:30:05	DRoberts556 Really? Self defense, huh? You expect to be assaulted or robbed any time soon?
flocktard	696838090388869120	2016-02-08T23:28:42	DRoberts556 Tell me what you' re "prepared" for.
flocktard	696837798100410368	2016-02-08T23:27:32	DRoberts556 Prepared for what?
flocktard	696837748859281409	2016-02-08T23:27:20	DRoberts556 Well, THAT was a normal answer.
flocktard	696837264370962432	2016-02-08T23:25:25	DRoberts556 Your "need" to pack is a sign of a pathology.
flocktard	696837140827742208	2016-02-08T23:24:55	DRoberts556 You're not listening to me. This isn't about "freedom" or "rights" to you.
flocktard	696836523568799745	2016-02-08T23:22:28	DRoberts556 Look at your profile. This isn't about "rights." You eat, breathe, live and crap guns. That's sick.
