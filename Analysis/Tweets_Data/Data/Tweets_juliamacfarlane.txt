juliamacfarlane	725016317070315520	2016-04-26T17:38:54	john_perkowski Yup. I mean either way what Naz Shah said is abhorrent no matter the label. I saw a rather misleading quote too
juliamacfarlane	725015894766792707	2016-04-26T17:37:14	juliamacfarlane Anti-Semitism, TO ME, is a specific form of racism.  The difference is the racial identity includes a specific religion too
juliamacfarlane	725015958423740421	2016-04-26T17:37:29	LahavHarkov Oh of course, but I mean the hatred of all Israelis that attempts to connect them with govt policies

juliamacfarlane	725015204162056192	2016-04-26T17:34:29	ArnoRosenfeld I'm just wondering if there is a distinction between anti Semitism, racism against Israelis or if we simply can't separate
juliamacfarlane	725014992794300418	2016-04-26T17:33:39	LahavHarkov or are Jewish faith and race inseparable when it comes to hate speech, and therefore anti Semitism?
juliamacfarlane	725014888893026304	2016-04-26T17:33:14	LahavHarkov Do you think there is distinction to be made between anti-Semitism and racism against Israelis stemming from hatred of Isr govt
juliamacfarlane	725014389254922240	2016-04-26T17:31:15	juliamacfarlane Also, Jewish is not just a faith, it's a people. So one can be atheist and still Jewish.
