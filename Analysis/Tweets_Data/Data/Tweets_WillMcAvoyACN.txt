WillMcAvoyACN	723005623604928513	2016-04-21T04:29:08	ActualFlatticus Personally? I suspects she goes to the convention with around 150 pledged delegates shy of nomination
WillMcAvoyACN	723005463252471809	2016-04-21T04:28:29	ActualFlatticus And so far, by the way, my ACTUAL predictions have been within a few delegates of being accurate
WillMcAvoyACN	723005334508298240	2016-04-21T04:27:59	ActualFlatticus You asked me for a path. I presented a path. Of course it's speculation. The bottom line is one exists for her, not for him
