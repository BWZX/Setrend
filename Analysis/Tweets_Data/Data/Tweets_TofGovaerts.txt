TofGovaerts	719856649687711744	2016-04-12T11:56:14	BTabrum Well, it was a smart beta element for people able to take some risk :-) 2011-2016 and 2012-2018 ; 2018 bond fund is 50% hedged 1/2
TofGovaerts	719855249914208257	2016-04-12T11:50:40	BTabrum We have been following it up closely, we had 2 SIVs (bonds) of which 1 is still active and expires in 2018 ; it's hedged

TofGovaerts	719621296766742528	2016-04-11T20:21:01	tkouvakas KellerZoe minefornothing I fully agree, these stories are far from helping, people have every right to be angry about that
TofGovaerts	719619208544391168	2016-04-11T20:12:43	tkouvakas KellerZoe minefornothing Big problem,certainly today more extreme, and in extreme econ crisis facilitating extreme pol outcomes
TofGovaerts	719616837567254528	2016-04-11T20:03:18	KellerZoe tkouvakas minefornothing I know i sound paradoxical but we won't arrive there in a normal way my guess
TofGovaerts	719616611318161408	2016-04-11T20:02:24	KellerZoe tkouvakas minefornothing will be difficult to achieve without some leaders, drivers, wrestlers steering towards that goal
TofGovaerts	719616204567089157	2016-04-11T20:00:47	KellerZoe tkouvakas minefornothing I fully undfuerstand ; but the "ideal" project, ie fully democratic without regional dominance 1/2

TofGovaerts	719614607564922880	2016-04-11T19:54:26	tkouvakas KellerZoe minefornothing It's hard to expect a cure from doctors/nurses that never cared about the patient in the first place
TofGovaerts	719613730624040964	2016-04-11T19:50:57	tkouvakas KellerZoe minefornothing In the case of Greece, everything would could go wrong, materialized, including post crisis "medicine"
TofGovaerts	719613276141854721	2016-04-11T19:49:09	KellerZoe tkouvakas minefornothing me too ; some vital mistakes have been made, irreversible ? Time will tell
TofGovaerts	719613052283396096	2016-04-11T19:48:16	tkouvakas KellerZoe minefornothing complexe, I'm the first to admit that. But I am afraid of a fragmented Europe, that's all

TofGovaerts	719609781657464833	2016-04-11T19:35:16	tkouvakas KellerZoe minefornothing probably, but I don't like that evolution. Like I said, we live in a globalized world more than ever
TofGovaerts	719609374616985600	2016-04-11T19:33:39	CCFCattaneo KellerZoe tkouvakas minefornothing It was very crucial indeed, in combo with some hefty measures wrt banks/macroprudential
TofGovaerts	719608811523338240	2016-04-11T19:31:25	tkouvakas KellerZoe minefornothing a very good point ; fiscal transfers, not possible without pol union as now in Europe
TofGovaerts	719608613195681792	2016-04-11T19:30:37	KellerZoe tkouvakas minefornothing coming back to diversity and lack of political union -)
TofGovaerts	719608440709115904	2016-04-11T19:29:56	CCFCattaneo KellerZoe tkouvakas minefornothing I know, very bad real estate fin crisis 91. Point was that in '99, they could qualify
TofGovaerts	719607896791715840	2016-04-11T19:27:46	KellerZoe tkouvakas minefornothing Which is extremely difficult unless similar economies having converged, Simple as that. They haven't
TofGovaerts	719607381370486788	2016-04-11T19:25:44	KellerZoe tkouvakas minefornothing Yes agree, but in a sense, is USD a perfect currency for all US states ? What's a perfect mon union ?
TofGovaerts	719606822542385152	2016-04-11T19:23:30	KellerZoe tkouvakas minefornothing like Denmark and Sweden were the best qualified to go ahead if necessary
TofGovaerts	719606571869843457	2016-04-11T19:22:31	KellerZoe tkouvakas minefornothing And even Belgium was questionable in those days ; paradox was that countries opting out 1/2
TofGovaerts	719606276330811392	2016-04-11T19:21:20	tkouvakas KellerZoe minefornothing fully agree, and GS a full accomplice
TofGovaerts	719605580940382208	2016-04-11T19:18:34	tkouvakas KellerZoe minefornothing I once blogged about this in 2011 :-) 
TofGovaerts	719604990550138880	2016-04-11T19:16:14	KellerZoe tkouvakas minefornothing I know he has a Goldman background etc ; but don't think Germ is happy since 2012 the way ECB is ruled
TofGovaerts	719604493059538945	2016-04-11T19:14:15	KellerZoe tkouvakas minefornothing benign neglect to the extent that Germany has been overruled by Draghi &amp; the others, my point
TofGovaerts	719603899590709249	2016-04-11T19:11:53	tkouvakas KellerZoe minefornothing perfect example of political interest not being realistic in terms of econ reality
TofGovaerts	719603572292378625	2016-04-11T19:10:35	tkouvakas KellerZoe minefornothing I understand, and Greece should never have been part of EMU ; more the merrier was the idea 1/2
TofGovaerts	719603261754470400	2016-04-11T19:09:21	KellerZoe tkouvakas minefornothing When it comes to mon policy (agree or not), ECB's attitude has been benign neglect, no germ dominance
TofGovaerts	719602171319332864	2016-04-11T19:05:01	KellerZoe tkouvakas minefornothing But you're not serving anything on your own when the big ones are around the table,nevermind omelettes
TofGovaerts	719601807887089664	2016-04-11T19:03:35	KellerZoe tkouvakas minefornothing You don't make omelettes without breaking eggs, sometimes the French (De Gaulle), sometimes others 1/2
TofGovaerts	719600796598460416	2016-04-11T18:59:34	tkouvakas KellerZoe All fine and well, true, but how you gonna play that out politically in a glob world with high interests at stake ?
TofGovaerts	719600112331153408	2016-04-11T18:56:50	KellerZoe tkouvakas minefornothing I hate the prospect where Europe has to say nothing and others fight their battles over here ; deja vu
TofGovaerts	719599698433150977	2016-04-11T18:55:12	KellerZoe tkouvakas minefornothing Even a front runner on many fronts btw; now living in globalized world with some pretty strong players
TofGovaerts	719597226641764352	2016-04-11T18:45:22	tkouvakas KellerZoe minefornothing it does however not imply that the ideal wasn't worth fighting for, and undertsandable from histor POV
TofGovaerts	719596915516698629	2016-04-11T18:44:08	tkouvakas KellerZoe minefornothing It's a myth, project had post-war best of intentions but went wrong (econ/mon union, no pol union) 1/2
TofGovaerts	719595286293778432	2016-04-11T18:37:40	KellerZoe tkouvakas minefornothing True, but a fragmented Europe with UK certainly not chosing for Europe will only help US, China/Russia
TofGovaerts	719593832552251392	2016-04-11T18:31:53	KellerZoe tkouvakas minefornothing And geopolitically even less to say then now, repeating history ? Not sure desirable
