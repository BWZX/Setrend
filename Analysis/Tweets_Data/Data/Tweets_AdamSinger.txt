AdamSinger	726148115196059648	2016-04-29T20:36:16	jennita so now kids will just press a button and never explore a software package that could lead to a career?
AdamSinger	726147996132364288	2016-04-29T20:35:48	jennita but that's even worse. Hear me out:  many young graphic designers got  start by learning to use actual photoshop 'just having fun.'

AdamSinger	726144086378450944	2016-04-29T20:20:15	soaxelbrooke Beymour but as a millennial I can make fun of other millennials all I want :)
AdamSinger	726143263371993089	2016-04-29T20:16:59	Of course Snapchat would resurrect an old, not even funny years ago photoshop meme and pitch it to their users. Makes perfect sense now.

AdamSinger	726133150519173121	2016-04-29T19:36:48	Quote Tweet is genius. Creates engagement on things I wouldn't otherwise RT, easily 1 of Twitter's best small edits. 
AdamSinger	726132259426734081	2016-04-29T19:33:16	BenedictEvans I like it esp if the people use it to amplify a good discussion I would otherwise have missed. Can you propose a better way?

AdamSinger	726089166916743168	2016-04-29T16:42:02	Those celebs will never respond to anyone. It's not social. It's Twitter's attempt to be big media. But that's not going to save them ...
AdamSinger	726088973521539073	2016-04-29T16:41:16	What? It's unique to Twitter? That doesn't matter, it's still really not diff from what you could get in an online rag or on reality TV.
AdamSinger	726088736274976768	2016-04-29T16:40:19	Also one more Tweet on this: Moments sucks because is mostly lame celeb content *you can get anywhere* and NOT what makes TWTR special.
AdamSinger	726088367079755776	2016-04-29T16:38:51	Anyway I tweet because I irrationally ♥ Twitter. I'm sure they are working on all of this but wish we'd see more urgency from them.
AdamSinger	726088048585236480	2016-04-29T16:37:35	karangoel don't disagree.
AdamSinger	726087833136427008	2016-04-29T16:36:44	When I was working on consumer tech would do everything I could to get people to move up the value chain. TWTR needs to get to work on this.
AdamSinger	726087600755220480	2016-04-29T16:35:48	Anyway, just some thoughts. The what, 10M users Twitter grew by is great. But it isn't enough. It's failure so many lurk &amp; don't convert.
AdamSinger	726087399374114816	2016-04-29T16:35:00	It's what makes a social app part of our lives: we have to engage too. Twitter needs to solve for this in a big way. I have some ideas.
AdamSinger	726087116124344320	2016-04-29T16:33:53	And I think for social platforms to stick around you can't just have this giant cohort in listen only mode. They have to update too.
AdamSinger	726086979666862080	2016-04-29T16:33:20	Thing is, I do think to some extent Facebook HAS solved for "the big white box problem." Even my *grandma* updates it once in awhile!
AdamSinger	726086715815809025	2016-04-29T16:32:17	Anyway what does Twitter do to try &amp; solve for lurkers who don't update? Moments? But Moments is a bad experience. Sorry TWTR, just a joke.
AdamSinger	726085990398328832	2016-04-29T16:29:24	But Twitter stalled out around 300M users. Apparently (which should have been apparent from years ago) many people are simply too daunted.
AdamSinger	726085694901231616	2016-04-29T16:28:14	The thing is - "the big white box" isn't a problem for creative people. Which is why plenty of creative/smart people are already on Twitter.
AdamSinger	726085496418369536	2016-04-29T16:27:27	Let's talk TWTR, new users &amp; the "big white box" problem. In 2011 wrote a post about this related to blog platforms

AdamSinger	725871536150716416	2016-04-29T02:17:14	JFinDallas sspencer_smb patients see v clear benefit. Even FDA advisers agreed. But small N. Risk/reward skews for patients IMO.

AdamSinger	725870642373885952	2016-04-29T02:13:41	JFinDallas sspencer_smb in edge cases they are too risk averse. When at odds w/desperate patient population creates untenable situation.

AdamSinger	725749408759832576	2016-04-28T18:11:57	djgeoffe alex_morask AlanBleiweiss yeah and also IMO the skill isn't "content marketing" so much as deep understanding of sector.

AdamSinger	725747382663569409	2016-04-28T18:03:54	Either way at the end, this role isn't a journalist, it's a marketer, any content you create is with end goal of building the brand.
AdamSinger	725746796153073665	2016-04-28T18:01:34	Then again few journalists know how to create content that converts/builds a brand. You can hire one or the other but both require training.
AdamSinger	725745973889114112	2016-04-28T17:58:18	The problem isn't the position it's talent. Few marketers know how to consistently create (good) content themselves.

AdamSinger	724666566780948480	2016-04-25T18:29:07	kcm mikeharmanos RyanJones quiet they are trying to sell crappy software.
AdamSinger	724666004471599105	2016-04-25T18:26:53	RyanJones AdamSinger All marketing has "content", too.  Don't really understand what a content marketer does...
AdamSinger	724665973094137861	2016-04-25T18:26:46	Unsurprising.  
AdamSinger	724665736145199104	2016-04-25T18:25:49	Pharmdca seriously.
AdamSinger	724665674782543873	2016-04-25T18:25:35	meerasapra you are a proper marketer - no need to hide behind falsehoods you have real skills :)
AdamSinger	724665259496099840	2016-04-25T18:23:56	Social media guru already taken? Just be a marketing vp / director / manager if you want to be taken seriously. 
AdamSinger	724664712395264000	2016-04-25T18:21:45	Praval yes it's awesome but I've been critical of them forever - here's a post from 2010 ().
AdamSinger	724664346920390657	2016-04-25T18:20:18	Hah, in my days as an SEO I moved people off platforms like HubSpot onto WordPress. 
AdamSinger	724664113775800320	2016-04-25T18:19:22	I think what they need to do now is gut their content factory &amp; take new approach. That type of marketing is dead anyway. GL to them.
AdamSinger	724663745532710914	2016-04-25T18:17:55	Their team has egos so big they think they are gods gift to every type of marketing/PR, yet it's obvious they are a disaster.
AdamSinger	724663451784634369	2016-04-25T18:16:45	Also: HubSpot has guides like this. They're an absolute PR nightmare! No credibility whatsoever to offer this stuff. 
AdamSinger	724662470636249088	2016-04-25T18:12:51	No they didn't. They coopted something everyone was already doing and stuck a buzzword on it. 
AdamSinger	724662360342831104	2016-04-25T18:12:24	This tool for ex is an insult to every marketer/blogger/journalist/etc:  &lt;-hubspot thinks everyone too dumb to blog.
AdamSinger	724662071397208064	2016-04-25T18:11:16	But if you have a pure sales-oriented culture that is just trying to hawk their wares of course you don't care.
AdamSinger	724661857097654273	2016-04-25T18:10:24	And content is not purely a lead gen exercise - it actually reflects your company. If you are a premium brand you don't ever do the above.
AdamSinger	724661569892671489	2016-04-25T18:09:16	Anyway I've been critical of their approach for years (basically in their mind more content no matter how shitty is always good).
AdamSinger	724661274911494146	2016-04-25T18:08:06	HubSpot thinks they generate 14,000 (!) leads a mo (right). They have to get &gt;1M visitors to blog to achieve this. Dumb on all accounts.
AdamSinger	724660875773108224	2016-04-25T18:06:30	Any proper mktg team wouldn't count every form fill for en ebook a lead. This is fluffing #'s, please don't ever follow their example.
AdamSinger	724660616904871937	2016-04-25T18:05:29	Finished Disrupted Sunday (couldn't put it down). Still laughing about much of it. My fav is don't think HubSpot even knows what a lead is.
AdamSinger	724658789014601728	2016-04-25T17:58:13	jason_koebler 👊👊 ...also screw the big artists. Their time is over it's a dumb blip in music history so many talented people now.
AdamSinger	724657944172748800	2016-04-25T17:54:52	jason_koebler fair enough. I also think all these exclusive albums are garbage :)
AdamSinger	724657635396476928	2016-04-25T17:53:38	jason_koebler I do - it's  reason I don't / won't use Tidal / Spotify &amp; love SoundCloud - closed vs open platforms. Open platforms better.
AdamSinger	724657439212105728	2016-04-25T17:52:51	KidDynamiteBlog  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
AdamSinger	724656826763997184	2016-04-25T17:50:25	Cool, solve more problems that have already been solved for decades in countless ways. That'll save ya. 
AdamSinger	724656165376815105	2016-04-25T17:47:47	Other thing  is none of the 'exclusive' big label music is any good anyway. We have such a long tail of artists now. 
AdamSinger	724655314172174336	2016-04-25T17:44:25	KidDynamiteBlog lol I'm dying.

AdamSinger	724644496575586306	2016-04-25T17:01:25	I wrote this for AdamSinger and the future buzz who I've admired forever. It's about PR's war on media relations.  
AdamSinger	724639693225136128	2016-04-25T16:42:20	LOL dying. Ryan you're the best.

AdamSinger	724631726253727744	2016-04-25T16:10:41	DrorEngel yup.
AdamSinger	724405589770522628	2016-04-25T01:12:06	balkdog81 OphirGottlieb the rain is life giving actually.
AdamSinger	724375886896582656	2016-04-24T23:14:04	You should never tell a customer what they "should" do, long lasting business meet customers where they are 
AdamSinger	724375949488201728	2016-04-24T23:14:19	mawkus yeah it's a shitty business though.
AdamSinger	724375195130064896	2016-04-24T23:11:19	sspencer_smb it's Sunday and I'm tired do we want to open that can of worms? Just Tweet that to the cashtag and you'll find out.
AdamSinger	724375030021255168	2016-04-24T23:10:40	benjamingaines mawkus brianau BlairReeves yeah fair Ben's response isn't like the other. Meanwhile Forrester guy prob wants their biz :)
AdamSinger	724374581507579906	2016-04-24T23:08:53	So basically this means no one reads labels. 
AdamSinger	724374228229746689	2016-04-24T23:07:28	This is amazing!  
AdamSinger	724373929473675264	2016-04-24T23:06:17	mawkus reality is difficult for some to see.
AdamSinger	724373272947642369	2016-04-24T23:03:41	TheJGR don't watch Veep or use Slack. soooooooo 
AdamSinger	724372843295739906	2016-04-24T23:01:58	mawkus agree.
AdamSinger	724372604191051777	2016-04-24T23:01:01	OphirGottlieb 100%. Also it isn't just HubSpot -many people in SV going through this, book is about certain type of startups in general.
AdamSinger	724372097691058176	2016-04-24T22:59:00	mawkus it's great that a career coach thinks they have credibility to interpret how a response affects markets, employees and stakeholders.
AdamSinger	724371423544774656	2016-04-24T22:56:20	OphirGottlieb I think this response was worse than nothing at all, esp trying to paint Dan as a satirist. This book wasn't satire.
AdamSinger	724371097219567616	2016-04-24T22:55:02	OphirGottlieb he never addressed the real issues: making employees cry, their ridiculous sales practices, toxic culture, etc.
AdamSinger	724370544506724352	2016-04-24T22:52:50	tomfgoodwin all my art is 100% free, enjoy here:  ...ads pay for my words as writer though :)

AdamSinger	724368501687775236	2016-04-24T22:44:43	StockMatusow sweet. Look forward to it. I play too.
AdamSinger	724367883678011392	2016-04-24T22:42:16	nixon786 still holding a little, I believe in the company and the drug not the buyout.
AdamSinger	724367647182196737	2016-04-24T22:41:19	mgershoff danbarker whole retort terrible, they are caught up in their cult. Any company routinely making people cry isn't defensible btw.
AdamSinger	724367194205917186	2016-04-24T22:39:31	AdamSinger danbarker What is shocking about their retort is that they have over one thousand employees and yet only 85 are 40 or older?
AdamSinger	724367372065218560	2016-04-24T22:40:14	mugatushair nixon786 I have traded it for almost 4 years. No position going into final event though I have no reason to risk gains on it.
AdamSinger	724366444448768000	2016-04-24T22:36:33	nixon786 yeah the buyout rumor isn't a reason to own them (or any company!).
AdamSinger	724366209068584960	2016-04-24T22:35:36	nixon786 yeah somehow SRPT makes RLYP look like a mutual fund lol.
AdamSinger	724366113463640064	2016-04-24T22:35:14	Moes_HQ open up a San Francisco location guys. Please.

AdamSinger	724365493189120000	2016-04-24T22:32:46	love how the core pitch for the Apple Watch has devolved into "it will help you find your iPhone" 
AdamSinger	724364870146101248	2016-04-24T22:30:17	nixon786 I hope it gets a conditional approval - for the kids / parents. I just couldn't handle the drama trading / owning it.
AdamSinger	724364672963477505	2016-04-24T22:29:30	mobile_reach MichaelCarusi none of us are!

AdamSinger	724363886116229120	2016-04-24T22:26:23	louisgray briansolis yes, they hold up 100%, people doing same things they have always done (because they can get away with it).
AdamSinger	724363659145699328	2016-04-24T22:25:29	Culmination of 1 of most emotional stories for patients, advocacy groups, team members/investors. Rooting for SRPT. 
AdamSinger	724361238843527168	2016-04-24T22:15:51	JernejaJF yes must be improved, young people shouldn't be taken advantage of should be in positions they are learning / growing.
AdamSinger	724361076435869697	2016-04-24T22:15:13	JernejaJF agree -- get some rest &amp; have a nice night.
AdamSinger	724360944525021185	2016-04-24T22:14:41	JernejaJF IDK I chose not to work at startups anymore. Maybe 1 day go back to consulting for them but prob not work at one I didn't start.
AdamSinger	724360698176774144	2016-04-24T22:13:43	JernejaJF have been 'branded' as cool &amp; lure young people in to get rich quickly but that's the game. All Dan is doing is telling reality.
AdamSinger	724360530886950912	2016-04-24T22:13:03	JernejaJF I mean - for a normal, long-term sustainable company. Which most startups are not. Majority will end in tears.
AdamSinger	724360339886735361	2016-04-24T22:12:17	JernejaJF I have consulted for 100s of companies, what goes on over there is not a healthy work environment nor is it normal.
AdamSinger	724358851638661121	2016-04-24T22:06:22	JernejaJF right -book is just using HubSpot as an example but realdanlyons paints bigger picture too. It's happening at lots of startups.
AdamSinger	724358585577140224	2016-04-24T22:05:19	JernejaJF for sure read the book. And agree have worked at other startups that illicit this behavior. You're 100% right not unique to them.
AdamSinger	724357797979156480	2016-04-24T22:02:11	MichaelCarusi oh for sure they have to brand themselves in this light to employers and investors to justify their insane valuation.
AdamSinger	724357510488956928	2016-04-24T22:01:03	Here's a great post on this by louisgray - there are no billion $ startups, just highly valued private companies: 
AdamSinger	724357308185079808	2016-04-24T22:00:14	Hasn't been startup in ages. Brand themselves as such to justify insane work hours, easily manipulates young people. 
AdamSinger	724356889501265920	2016-04-24T21:58:35	JernejaJF my opinions are my own, not my employer's &amp; they are not neutral. I personally don't believe in this type of startup.
AdamSinger	724356516178857984	2016-04-24T21:57:06	JernejaJF did you read Dan's book? Making employees cry and overwork entry level folk to point of being burnt out isn't sustainable.
AdamSinger	724356145142325248	2016-04-24T21:55:37	mobile_reach bwahahah no it wasn't you would never work for those guys.
AdamSinger	724355577963384832	2016-04-24T21:53:22	It is the wrong approach this was a tactic to get people to leave, plain &amp; simple. 
AdamSinger	724355459860164608	2016-04-24T21:52:54	JernejaJF this has absolutely nothing to do with my Tweetstorm these are personal opinions as someone commenting on tech sector for 15 yrs.
AdamSinger	724354511247015936	2016-04-24T21:49:07	naoyak dharmesh their PR team 
AdamSinger	724353871577894912	2016-04-24T21:46:35	.danbarker I ♥ MKTO &amp; think HUBS is a short here. Prob should have shorted when book came out. [I previously consulted for Marketo btw]
AdamSinger	724353510297325568	2016-04-24T21:45:09	Yrs ago their sales team tried to sell friend of mine (who owns an SMB). I sat silently on call. Sales guy aggressive/clueless. Makes sense.
AdamSinger	724353143115378688	2016-04-24T21:43:41	But knowing a bunch of people close to situation + reading Dan's book, Dan 100% affirms the shit show that is HubSpot.
AdamSinger	724352867167928320	2016-04-24T21:42:36	Although at one point HubSpot had a very talented VP work there, but he's gone now along with their CMO who I have no opinion on.
AdamSinger	724352520542248960	2016-04-24T21:41:13	Guess this was inevitable though - never liked HubSpot's software personally &amp; their team mostly chose "egos" in marketing sector vs talent.
AdamSinger	724351459890851840	2016-04-24T21:37:00	Also don't know what drugs dharmesh /his PR folk took that made them think publishing this response was a good idea 
AdamSinger	724349403545231362	2016-04-24T21:28:50	JPedde realdanlyons yes you have to. PS Dan uses pseudonyms but you will know who all the characters are.
AdamSinger	724332022349471744	2016-04-24T20:19:46	JPedde realdanlyons no it's totally cathartic. Must read.
AdamSinger	724299525628657665	2016-04-24T18:10:38	And for the record there were/are some good folk at HubSpot. But think they got caught up in mess of a company/culture. I feel bad for them.
AdamSinger	724297287921360896	2016-04-24T18:01:44	TheAJSinclair nooo go read it. Trust me.
AdamSinger	724297046409117696	2016-04-24T18:00:47	Anyway go read. Even if you aren't in marketing or startup industry realdanlyons also talks markets / investments. Something for everyone.
AdamSinger	724296501791330304	2016-04-24T17:58:37	Seriously unsurprised it was them. They are cheerleaders of garbage marketing / "content for sake of content." Good they were called out.
AdamSinger	724296301672693760	2016-04-24T17:57:49	It's not really about HubSpot, more about bigger picture of what's happening in startup land. HubSpot just (IMO inevitable) example.
AdamSinger	724295856694808576	2016-04-24T17:56:03	I heard gist of it already from my gf plus louisgray who both already finished it. But is one of those you have to read yourself for sure.
AdamSinger	724295403714142208	2016-04-24T17:54:15	Started reading realdanlyons book yest. You have to read. Dan nails so much of what is wrong with startup culture +his writing is amazing.

AdamSinger	723989636700196865	2016-04-23T21:39:15	Anyway I don't know why I even bother responding to these absurd trend stories anymore. Milllennials are NOT a useful cohort for anything.
AdamSinger	723989155303186433	2016-04-23T21:37:20	So that paragraph is completely useless b/c the other group of millennials barely out of college of course have no or negative savings.
AdamSinger	723988809575075841	2016-04-23T21:35:57	For instance, this is quoted in the Bloomberg story. But it's a 20+ year cohort! Many milllennials are mid-30s now. 
AdamSinger	723988559481327616	2016-04-23T21:34:58	Meanwhile, again, writing trend stories on Millennials is completely and totally worthless for SO MANY reasons ().
AdamSinger	723987776794808321	2016-04-23T21:31:51	Eh, who even cares. I don't want to own a house anyway - if it can't be managed in a dashboard it's too much work.

AdamSinger	722921398222458880	2016-04-20T22:54:27	dhulser we can only hope the current content has negative brand association for me have to say. It hurts more than helps them.
AdamSinger	722920484732403713	2016-04-20T22:50:49	dhulser of course but they aren't a tech company there's no reason for Twitter to flog irrelevant content to me they have so much data.
AdamSinger	722919560286830592	2016-04-20T22:47:09	ericmbudd Trending Topics not nearly as bad.

AdamSinger	722919429198127104	2016-04-20T22:46:37	dhulser don't care if it's supposed to be news or "viral" Moments honestly looks like you need to be lobotomized to enjoy it.
AdamSinger	722918110899011584	2016-04-20T22:41:23	dhulser I don't know but it's consistently a joke.
AdamSinger	722917492318871552	2016-04-20T22:38:55	Top news of the day, as prioritized by Twitter Moments. Only 1 real piece of news &amp; barely above the fold ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
AdamSinger	722916802183847941	2016-04-20T22:36:11	HillYes1 agree gotta work hard &amp; become top in your field, then you are in better position to dictate terms / feel more confident leaving.
AdamSinger	722916587057979392	2016-04-20T22:35:20	HillYes1 I've actually always had women managers on the agency side and only had good experiences. Perhaps I'm lucky.

AdamSinger	722888144798879748	2016-04-20T20:42:18	jennita PeterNikolow randfish agree 100% with Rand though they were dumb to hire Lyons, tough to feel bad they did no due diligence.
AdamSinger	722887605482696710	2016-04-20T20:40:10	HillYes1 if you are young yes prob have to tough it out (we all have in our careers) but at certain point power shifts to employee.
AdamSinger	722887061636665344	2016-04-20T20:38:00	jennita PeterNikolow randfish just started reading - don't think the book is really about HubSpot as much as commentary on sector.

AdamSinger	722864370246488065	2016-04-20T19:07:50	culbrich sure but you don't *need* to be there every single day always. Esp pending what role is.
AdamSinger	722859957780000768	2016-04-20T18:50:18	beijingdou davewiner maybe I'm weird b/c I always composed music outside of work, but I've always wanted time for both.
AdamSinger	722859857200582657	2016-04-20T18:49:54	This x100. Your A-list employees are productive (&amp; passionately so) from anywhere. Preferably quiet place actually. 
AdamSinger	722859554610937856	2016-04-20T18:48:42	TurboResearch yes most things end in worthless options and tears unfortunately.
AdamSinger	722859386918404097	2016-04-20T18:48:02	mawkus agree maker's vs manager's sched. Know which one is you, and make it happen. You can't do both!
AdamSinger	722859290839490561	2016-04-20T18:47:39	beijingdou davewiner I don't think anyone "ages out" who is passionate about what they do. Sorry if I misinterpreted you.
AdamSinger	722858719235559424	2016-04-20T18:45:23	beijingdou cc davewiner his thoughts on this topic are smart.
AdamSinger	722858396827844608	2016-04-20T18:44:06	beijingdou I don't necessarily agree.
AdamSinger	722858024054882304	2016-04-20T18:42:37	HillYes1 I don't buy it in tech &amp; media, I really don't. We aren't working in an ER, our work isn't *that* epic.
AdamSinger	722857716956266499	2016-04-20T18:41:24	So you're going to get crap work from people anyway. I don't think it's sustainable and frankly I wouldn't even invest in cos that do this.
AdamSinger	722857550304010241	2016-04-20T18:40:44	Also 1 more thing here: managers that want crazy hours every day are clueless. Humans have physical limits on amount of productivity in day.
AdamSinger	722857168295186433	2016-04-20T18:39:13	beijingdou I don't  agree w/this - I don't have kids &amp; want balance. Humans are not robots you simply can't be productive 24/7. Impossible.

AdamSinger	722856601774792704	2016-04-20T18:36:58	Kate nails it: nothing is worth trading your health for, it's all you have. 
AdamSinger	722856421243523072	2016-04-20T18:36:15	If you're in toxic culture situation either work to rectify, or quit. It's so easy. There are other jobs. Don't stay w/insane people.
AdamSinger	722856056821456896	2016-04-20T18:34:48	Anyway, steps for smart people: figure out expectations BEFORE you join a company. Make sure you hold them to these!
AdamSinger	722855732769460224	2016-04-20T18:33:31	swb1192 you have heard rumors.
AdamSinger	722855657204887552	2016-04-20T18:33:13	Fair, if you have bunch of stock &amp; know the risk/reward profile + they set expectations going in, that's one thing. 
AdamSinger	722854772668112896	2016-04-20T18:29:42	AdamSinger huge problem but #1 problem is simply "inexperienced management teams". There are many effects of this, including talent churn.
AdamSinger	722855405357899777	2016-04-20T18:32:13	OF COURSE some days at all companies require this. But if every day (esp if they want you physically there) it's a toxic culture for all.
AdamSinger	722855166404198400	2016-04-20T18:31:16	No job is that impt unless you have a legit % of the co, if you're working 12-14+ hour days you are being taken advantage of. Period.
AdamSinger	722854694448549889	2016-04-20T18:29:23	But moreso, you're never going to attract more good talent because they will know better / stay away. Your reputation always precedes you.
AdamSinger	722854435869687808	2016-04-20T18:28:22	Which is clueless and unsustainable. 1st of it it shows these companies are actually terrible at efficiency and don't have any processes.
AdamSinger	722854232567603201	2016-04-20T18:27:33	Hear stories every week from diff people about this and it's basically always the same. Young founders expect 12+ hour days from everyone.
AdamSinger	722854085758562304	2016-04-20T18:26:58	Easily # 1 one problem in Bay Area startups: inexperienced management teams who suffer talent attrition due to overworking best people.

AdamSinger	722832669550256129	2016-04-20T17:01:52	AdamSinger IMO MGM stock might as well be a Las Vegas ETF. Betting on the city itself rather than the company.

AdamSinger	722544083042975744	2016-04-19T21:55:08	AdamSinger The juice isn't worth the squeeze here. Keep the Change program from BofA -- rounding up card purchases for savings way easier.
AdamSinger	722543405381713921	2016-04-19T21:52:26	Anyway, this has been the latest installment of crazy startup ideas. Stay tuned for next edition which I'm sure will be in near future.
AdamSinger	722543159528415232	2016-04-19T21:51:28	And  true scrimper / savers prob wouldn't give an app company cut of their change. Maybe I'm wrong! I love it when startups prove me wrong.
AdamSinger	722542982583287809	2016-04-19T21:50:45	I also gotta say, the people who shell out $ for fancy apps / devices don't care this much to immediately get ROI on pocket / car change.
AdamSinger	722542739716313088	2016-04-19T21:49:48	Washboard that was name of it!! Thanks Dan. And they charged you $27 for $20 in quarters!  
AdamSinger	722542414544510976	2016-04-19T21:48:30	It isn't NFLX for coins. You have to put them through the device &amp; mail them AKA work. Also touching coins = gross. 
AdamSinger	722542210558734336	2016-04-19T21:47:41	Yes. Coinstar is awesome &amp; solves this. +it's actually fun to go &amp; change it up all at once / make a nice payday. 
AdamSinger	722541678741983232	2016-04-19T21:45:35	Not to mention is PITA to ship batches of coins off (does the startup just eat this cost - mailing enough coins to make bank is HEAVY).
AdamSinger	722541523888263168	2016-04-19T21:44:58	Also most of us use credit for most things - cash less &amp; less. And that makes us hang on to coins (esp quarters) for things like laundry.
AdamSinger	722541175886905344	2016-04-19T21:43:35	This is adding more complexity to something you don't even think about (nor should you) daily. It's actually making it more annoying IMHO.
AdamSinger	722540959049756672	2016-04-19T21:42:43	It's simple 1x/done task, batching slowly doesn't make sense it's not much $ you're not losing interest on the 50$ in coins/year you save.
AdamSinger	722540583709872128	2016-04-19T21:41:13	So basically: I don't see any problem being solved here. You save extra coins &amp; bring them to coinstar or whatever what, 1x every 2 years?
AdamSinger	722540094985383936	2016-04-19T21:39:17	Your moment of zen: I present to you . Go to the link. Watch the video. Trust me. Don't even know where to begin.
AdamSinger	722539934280626177	2016-04-19T21:38:39	It's a hard problem, I know I stay up at night thinking about. But don't fret - there's now an app AND device that will solve it!
AdamSinger	722539635209973761	2016-04-19T21:37:27	Anyway who else has way too many coins around their house / apartment and doesn't already have a solution for them? Waiting ...
AdamSinger	722539480066891776	2016-04-19T21:36:50	The best part about the startup that would send you quarters for laundry is basically they were selling you $20 of quarters for like, $22.
AdamSinger	722539341872910336	2016-04-19T21:36:17	What if I told you there's ANOTHER startup trying to do stuff w/coins. Recall awhile ago there was 1 that'd SHIP you quarters for laundry.

AdamSinger	722453626992459776	2016-04-19T15:55:41	AdamSinger amazing how many folks don't get that being smart about data doesn't dilute (and in fact enhances) the art part of it
AdamSinger	722453888742207488	2016-04-19T15:56:44	They are connecting PR to actual metrics that matter and not sharing dumb, dated, useless PR metrics like ad equivalency (so silly).
AdamSinger	722453480040890368	2016-04-19T15:55:06	Cool part? Lots of fluff measurement in PR. Yet AirPR team is led by sharamfm &amp; rebekahiliff who actually get this stuff.

AdamSinger	722452871933878272	2016-04-19T15:52:41	But many in PR still don't measure. That's all changing thanks to our awesome technology partner AirPR. Gold standard for PR measurement.
AdamSinger	722452656929673216	2016-04-19T15:51:50	Google Analytics already transformed marketing from 'soft art' into data-driven, methodical practice that is equal parts science &amp; art.
AdamSinger	722452382676680707	2016-04-19T15:50:45	If you're in PR (or retain a PR agency) and aren't getting detailed metrics reports, you're still in the 90s. PR now is VERY quantifiable.

AdamSinger	722437278535057408	2016-04-19T14:50:44	Agree with Caro. Also just look at analytics and you'll see how little these channels matter for non consumer stuff.

AdamSinger	722153016388820992	2016-04-18T20:01:10	ComfortablySmug TheStalwart no kids &amp; I guess almost middle age here: looks awful. I'd always rather go to smaller venues though.
AdamSinger	722151329938837505	2016-04-18T19:54:28	HilzFuld (granted, that's their own fault). I would rather work in proper Project Management software like Basecamp anyway. So much better.
AdamSinger	722151139370635264	2016-04-18T19:53:43	HilzFuld thank god no. My startup friend is on it and it's worse than email for her - they expect her to be on call 24/7. Awful.
AdamSinger	722150804539383808	2016-04-18T19:52:23	HilzFuld sparingly. Messaging just feature it's been around on the web forever don't see why everyone is so excited. Not interesting to me.
AdamSinger	722149206127804416	2016-04-18T19:46:02	HilzFuld only do things that are sharable / linkable permanent format. Otherwise I'm not wasting time. I don't even text or msg really.
AdamSinger	722149031401512961	2016-04-18T19:45:20	HilzFuld maybe I am too principled at this stage in life. Anyway I follow Seth Godin philosophy: it's all about doing less, better.
AdamSinger	722148427748904960	2016-04-18T19:42:56	HilzFuld no one I know personally would ever think it's okay to say that. Whatever, it's fine they have a successful niche product. Enjoy.
AdamSinger	722147885605761025	2016-04-18T19:40:47	HilzFuld meanwhile, I am ok not supporting this guy: 
AdamSinger	722147504666443776	2016-04-18T19:39:16	HilzFuld I don't want to share privately I want scaled communications and to share publicly with the world.
AdamSinger	722145242267328512	2016-04-18T19:30:17	HilzFuld ps  is snapchat's dumb problem. If they actually had linkable content it'd be fine. They don't want to play nice with rest of web.
AdamSinger	722144414353612800	2016-04-18T19:26:59	HilzFuld like if you linked a specific image on pinterest that'd be awesome. But just linking snap profiles is annoying.
AdamSinger	722144291624067072	2016-04-18T19:26:30	HilzFuld guess point is that to a lot of us twtr isn't a promotional link dump for other social profiles. If liked real content is better.
AdamSinger	722142417671983104	2016-04-18T19:19:03	HilzFuld have to be honest, CTR of Twitter dismal it's a terrible way to grow followers in any platform IMHO.  Better tactics.
AdamSinger	722142223857356800	2016-04-18T19:18:17	HilzFuld sharing it once or twice is fine but if all you did was share links there it'd be annoying.
AdamSinger	722141367854477312	2016-04-18T19:14:53	mobile_reach louisgray can I go back to work now please? :)
AdamSinger	722141167672950785	2016-04-18T19:14:05	mobile_reach louisgray thus splash page / CTAs at min - again insanely low effort / high reward.
AdamSinger	722141046117834753	2016-04-18T19:13:36	HilzFuld very true but none of my followers share Pinterest profiles all day either. Snap isn't special.
AdamSinger	722140871643111428	2016-04-18T19:12:55	mobile_reach louisgray prob can't take you seriously or give you my $ without these things.
AdamSinger	722140803053715457	2016-04-18T19:12:38	mobile_reach louisgray it is glaring for any company not to have a domain at all. It's like not having a phone number or mailing address.
AdamSinger	722140678449274881	2016-04-18T19:12:09	mobile_reach louisgray but there is SOME use case. I wouldn't just delete it entirely. At v least splash page/cta. Low effort high return.
AdamSinger	722140482822807553	2016-04-18T19:11:22	mobile_reach louisgray can't know unless you test things. If you had data that said it for a specific brand then yes.
AdamSinger	722140332129787904	2016-04-18T19:10:46	HilzFuld but you assume we are on snapchat or care. This is Twitter, so for those of us who don't it's spam.
AdamSinger	722140083772469248	2016-04-18T19:09:47	mobile_reach louisgray agree if analytics tells you no ROI then don't do it.
AdamSinger	722139889496535040	2016-04-18T19:09:01	mobile_reach louisgray many sectors yes.
AdamSinger	722139850002944001	2016-04-18T19:08:51	HilzFuld morganb TaliaGw fair. I guess I could just turn off your RTs too, but I like your other content.
AdamSinger	722139510402785282	2016-04-18T19:07:30	mobile_reach louisgray right we're arguing 2 v diff points.
AdamSinger	722139439502196736	2016-04-18T19:07:13	morganb HilzFuld TaliaGw you guys know this is Twitter right.
AdamSinger	722139129954181120	2016-04-18T19:05:59	mobile_reach louisgray if they ever don't I'll concede!
AdamSinger	722139025578917889	2016-04-18T19:05:35	mobile_reach louisgray my websites make me $ every month (not work related). So you aren't going to win this argument :)
AdamSinger	722138128668987392	2016-04-18T19:02:01	mobile_reach louisgray we can agree to disagree.
AdamSinger	722137816352686080	2016-04-18T19:00:46	mobile_reach louisgray BuzzFeed, NYT etc have great web experiences. Do you think they would just shut them down? That'd be insane.
AdamSinger	722137715630735360	2016-04-18T19:00:22	mobile_reach louisgray (PS it's our job to market this stuff)
AdamSinger	722137585166880768	2016-04-18T18:59:51	mobile_reach louisgray if you market it :)
AdamSinger	722137323970822144	2016-04-18T18:58:49	mobile_reach louisgray media need something to link to if you want PR value from your content, etc. Or via social. Tons of value.
AdamSinger	722137194756837376	2016-04-18T18:58:18	mobile_reach louisgray I don't agree - done properly you should be archiving that content in reference-able format.
AdamSinger	722136703322853377	2016-04-18T18:56:21	mobile_reach not good to ever rely on any one source for traffic or revenue. No one has monopoly on attention.
AdamSinger	722136459243757568	2016-04-18T18:55:23	mobile_reach louisgray don't agree great web experiences are awesome &amp; it's just a hub to go out to everywhere. Netflix model baby.
AdamSinger	722136352104456192	2016-04-18T18:54:57	mobile_reach louisgray email is not tiny esp for uses like B2B. #1 lead source for nearly every marketer I talk to.
AdamSinger	722134857766178816	2016-04-18T18:49:01	mobile_reach louisgray you need both. Unless you don't want to also reach people via email &amp; web. (Web needed for email to work best).
AdamSinger	722134638626361344	2016-04-18T18:48:09	mobile_reach louisgray of course - your own site, app + other people's platforms.
AdamSinger	722134217782497281	2016-04-18T18:46:28	mobile_reach louisgray use both cost owned + rented cost is the same if you know how to create processes it's easy.
AdamSinger	722134009619189760	2016-04-18T18:45:39	Further you rely on someone else who may change rules at any time. Make sure you have proper home base. Also so easy to do no reason not to.
AdamSinger	722133696371789824	2016-04-18T18:44:24	If you don't have a place where you control the vertical/horizontal you can't ever have calls to action / drive people to do what you want.
AdamSinger	722133483758288896	2016-04-18T18:43:33	You build equity in online properties in the form of links, subscribers, content, etc. You can use other platforms to help, for sure. But!
AdamSinger	722133287083225090	2016-04-18T18:42:46	Seriously people this is day 1 stuff. "But this time it's different" ... so how's that MySpace page working out.  
AdamSinger	722131159178567680	2016-04-18T18:34:19	Always need own home base (a domain you own!). Those who don't either new to the internet or don't pay attention.

AdamSinger	719157923700543488	2016-04-10T13:39:44	Stockanalysis92 actaestfabulaXX m_denniswinters RazBioTech correct. It's all about their delivery tech.
AdamSinger	719157827101528065	2016-04-10T13:39:21	I believe it. This is why drones will eventually win for food delivery.

AdamSinger	719024477502242816	2016-04-10T04:49:28	psuvafan007 SFNick I have now had enough bad delivery experiences in SF now to be done with them. It's prob better, healthier to cook.
AdamSinger	719023275989336065	2016-04-10T04:44:42	louisgray yes I need to try Shopping Express now that they have Whole Foods.
AdamSinger	719023113229312000	2016-04-10T04:44:03	My experiences with the on-demand economy have been mostly crap, with uber being the notable exception - they always just work.
AdamSinger	719022643265994752	2016-04-10T04:42:11	Instacart in particular kills me - I put down "1 pound of lemons" &amp; they gave me 1 lemon. Hilarious. It's easier just to do things yourself.
AdamSinger	719022407793545217	2016-04-10T04:41:15	Delivery in SF simply doesn't work for whatever reason. Similar to Instacart which I gave 2 shots and both times the orders were inaccurate.
AdamSinger	719022122081714177	2016-04-10T04:40:07	B/C I am extremely grateful for our awesome modern society. But I also don't repeat mistakes. So no more food delivery apps for me.
AdamSinger	719021771039465472	2016-04-10T04:38:43	PS, hope my previous Tweets don't make me sound ungrateful to live in an amazing world where you can order food with touch of a button.
AdamSinger	719021447390232576	2016-04-10T04:37:26	decillis hah maybe a pizza place by you can actually deliver on bringing you food. That's too hard for us to have here.
AdamSinger	719021133098450944	2016-04-10T04:36:11	decillis they have Mexican in Ohio I'm sure! :)
AdamSinger	719020123277819904	2016-04-10T04:32:10	What's good about SF is when it's too difficult for a tech co to deliver you a pizza you're never far from Mexican. 
AdamSinger	719007630975463424	2016-04-10T03:42:32	AdamSinger drones will fix this.
AdamSinger	719007171292205056	2016-04-10T03:40:42	...annnnnd the food delivery service sent me a ping saying they have canceled the order. 2.5 hrs later. OK, guess I am going out.

AdamSinger	719003150863187968	2016-04-10T03:24:44	AdamSinger -- most people in manhattan don't have cars, so without delivery the city couldn't function.
AdamSinger	719003527721279488	2016-04-10T03:26:14	JayHam99 lol it's okay - next time!
AdamSinger	719003350813900800	2016-04-10T03:25:31	Anyway I haven't eaten in 8+ hours now so that's good, maybe I'm getting into fat burn just by packing for my trip :)
AdamSinger	719002907215986691	2016-04-10T03:23:46	SFNick actually I like carrying my groceries home from Whole Foods. Walking uphill with 20 pounds = good workout.
AdamSinger	719002724214243328	2016-04-10T03:23:02	Yes delivery experience in NYC is amazing. SF sucks. Today is my last time ever doing this.

AdamSinger	719002007479058432	2016-04-10T03:20:11	SFNick they are always awful I remember why I stopped doing delivery.
AdamSinger	719001915586023424	2016-04-10T03:19:49	JayHam99 yes please.
AdamSinger	719001365716926464	2016-04-10T03:17:38	MichaelCarusi sorry it's actually 1.3 miles not 1.7!
AdamSinger	719001065853571080	2016-04-10T03:16:27	jeannabarrett you are lucky, dohertyjf and I have decided it's totally broken.
AdamSinger	719000949818167296	2016-04-10T03:15:59	JayHam99 it's combination of being tough to get around Frisco and these companies have shitty operations for sure.
AdamSinger	719000797866958854	2016-04-10T03:15:23	Jeena_Cho fly there on my invisible car? If I'm walking 1.3 miles I would just dine in :)
AdamSinger	719000709333581824	2016-04-10T03:15:02	Anyway, cooking yourself healthier, walking to the store good for you (I don't own a car) and it's cheaper. That's the way to go.
AdamSinger	719000197611675648	2016-04-10T03:13:00	The funny thing is delivery apps set expectations &amp; then don't keep them. If they had realistic time frame up front I wouldn't even care.
AdamSinger	718999953268289536	2016-04-10T03:12:01	When I lived in Fort Laud or Minneapolis food delivery was almost always under an hour or right about that long. Delivery in SF is a no go.
AdamSinger	718999537268883456	2016-04-10T03:10:22	I typically just cook myself, go out, or walk to get takeout but am prepping for a trip so wanted to save time. Lesson learned.
AdamSinger	718999150218457088	2016-04-10T03:08:50	Eat24 LOL I am waiting now thanks.
AdamSinger	718999103368142848	2016-04-10T03:08:39	To update - delivery service says it will be 15 more min. So 2 hrs, 15 min for delivery from a place that is 1.3m from my apt. Why bother?
AdamSinger	718998627742420993	2016-04-10T03:06:45	SJosephBurns LOL you're a trip to turn this into an image :-)
AdamSinger	718998220211249152	2016-04-10T03:05:08	Eat24 found out they are bringing it now ETA 15 min. So 2 hours 15 min for delivery from restaurant that is 1.3 miles from me. Why bother?

AdamSinger	718994486693535744	2016-04-10T02:50:18	kcm sure, but I know how to cook :)
AdamSinger	718994343395065856	2016-04-10T02:49:44	MichaelCarusi $5 says when it finally gets here it's cold too. I also tried to order pizza but that's too hard a problem to solve in SF.
AdamSinger	718994003954245633	2016-04-10T02:48:23	I'd never fund a delivery startup because of how bad experience is. It just isn't worth it. Good reminder to always just cook own dinner.
AdamSinger	718993747363532801	2016-04-10T02:47:22	Not going to call out a specific co because it isn't just them. ALL food delivery in SF simply doesn't work. Waiting 2+ hours is normal.
AdamSinger	718993312548462592	2016-04-10T02:45:38	Eat24 gracias!

AdamSinger	718864118166360064	2016-04-09T18:12:16	m_denniswinters Pharmdca I looked at product today seems legit.
AdamSinger	718864038659096576	2016-04-09T18:11:57	ChetStedman5 yeah the old adage there are no buyers on wall st, just sellers. Agree.
AdamSinger	718863766343983104	2016-04-09T18:10:52	ChetStedman5 lol indeed. Although 0% of the analysts should be trusted, ever. Be your own analyst &amp; ignore everyone else.
AdamSinger	718863580485935104	2016-04-09T18:10:08	Pharmdca looks like CHMA insiders aren't really too worried. geez 
AdamSinger	718862889436590080	2016-04-09T18:07:23	ChetStedman5 there is no biotech stock - not a single one - that at least one analyst has an insane (like +100% or even +200%) PT on.
AdamSinger	718861502174732288	2016-04-09T18:01:52	ChetStedman5 you must not follow biotech closely. At one point analysts had a 200$ target on BLUE for ex. Analysts in this sector clueless
AdamSinger	718859934490714112	2016-04-09T17:55:38	It's everyone's fantasy to be proposed to virtually, doing that in-person is way too informal.  
AdamSinger	718859238483697665	2016-04-09T17:52:52	ChetStedman5 that price was insanely high (they overpaid by a lot -too bad they didn't wait a month or two). But RLYP is for sure a target.

AdamSinger	718848714652065792	2016-04-09T17:11:03	BullLogic I agree on the first part. I just was in so so so deep broke all my rules on position sizing.

AdamSinger	718846477087342593	2016-04-09T17:02:10	BullLogic did you sell any on the spike? I was tilted and said screw it and bought a ton in low teens. Had to at least reduce a lil.

AdamSinger	718842911505289217	2016-04-09T16:48:00	Yup. I honestly wouldn't want to live in a world without Twitter. One of few products that can be said of. 
AdamSinger	718835587755720704	2016-04-09T16:18:54	AdamSinger IBM has no appetite (or cash) for an acquisition the size of MKTO. Won’t happen. TurboResearch
AdamSinger	718836388032983041	2016-04-09T16:22:04	TurboResearch yeah -- it'd be a fuck of a sell to their board since they already bought basically the same thing. I don't see it.
AdamSinger	718836168188506113	2016-04-09T16:21:12	Also one more awesome marketer from that team have to mention is andrewspoeth. Some smart startup should poach him for a VP role.
AdamSinger	718834905619116032	2016-04-09T16:16:11	TurboResearch interesting, BlairReeves used to work at IBM he might have thoughts.
AdamSinger	718834797028573184	2016-04-09T16:15:45	TurboResearch agree but MKTO users have deep product expertise &amp; use it to do certain things CRMs tools can't do. Go to their user summit!
AdamSinger	718834527993344000	2016-04-09T16:14:41	So you should be excited about that if you see good future. If it's expensive you shouldn't like it as much :) 
AdamSinger	718834300741783554	2016-04-09T16:13:47	Hubspot is fine for some small / medium companies but IMO tool just isn't for sophisticated marketers just yet. Maybe they will get there!
AdamSinger	718833814764527616	2016-04-09T16:11:51	Many of my personal friends are marketers/analysts. All Marketo users who had to switch to a co using Hubspot made them switch to mkto.
AdamSinger	718833392293249026	2016-04-09T16:10:10	Marketo very unique co in many ways and *easily* the best indie public martech company. Hubspot OK but I'd bet on MKTO any day over them.
AdamSinger	718832903132557312	2016-04-09T16:08:14	Disclosure: Marketo is a client I worked on TopRank yrs ago pre-IPO. Worked w/ jonmiller &amp; InboundMarketer - 2 of best marketers in SV.
AdamSinger	718831917873766400	2016-04-09T16:04:19	I do see MKTO as potential M&amp;A target but get sense they like being indie. Would have to be big premium to sell.

AdamSinger	718626203666493440	2016-04-09T02:26:53	I'm all good w/ saying I was wrong on QURE. Great science, data and results in patients but WS doesn't care. Can't be right on everything.
AdamSinger	718625911885602816	2016-04-09T02:25:43	Well this is clearly not happening &amp; QURE's a dog. Sorry srqstockpicker I'm giving up/opening to celebrate RLYP.

AdamSinger	718609440149078016	2016-04-09T01:20:16	bradloncar I wonder what % of ER doctors are also day traders / investors. It's definitely a trend.

AdamSinger	718298539412033537	2016-04-08T04:44:51	ChetStedman5 I think the 22M shares trades is a bit of a giveaway between chat room traders vs actual adults.
AdamSinger	718298061311721472	2016-04-08T04:42:57	hecht_dan WhiteCoatMafia some of us did. But clearly not enough. Can't be perfect - what if they got bought then?

AdamSinger	718294384245096449	2016-04-08T04:28:21	karangoel OphirGottlieb besides the shorts aren't always right - they aren't god &amp; are as wrong as longs.
AdamSinger	718294273645481986	2016-04-08T04:27:54	karangoel OphirGottlieb hahaha you need shorts for stocks to go up. I love stocks with high short positions as long as I'm right.

AdamSinger	718273005730795522	2016-04-08T03:03:24	Drchik23 JoeP450 not a doctor, but Pharmdca can chime in. Drs want to give drug to patients that could kill them? esp for certain cohorts
AdamSinger	718272764319244290	2016-04-08T03:02:26	Drchik23 JoeP450 ZSPH negative: they totally fucked up measurement of Edema &amp; hypertension and the FDA is going to nail them on it. RLYP

AdamSinger	717840026634092546	2016-04-06T22:22:53	VanessaAlvarez1 ahhh the old reminder of why I don't use Instagram.
AdamSinger	717839365502672896	2016-04-06T22:20:16	Meanwhile, in bizarro world, millennials can afford to buy Mercedes cars.

AdamSinger	717835316699090945	2016-04-06T22:04:10	I posted I support Hillary on FB once &amp; so many people ping me Bernie propaganda. Right or wrong, it just shows what happens. Tiresome.
AdamSinger	717834940629389312	2016-04-06T22:02:41	Because all this does is cause fights &amp; yelling. It's like talking about it at family dinner - you just don't do it.

AdamSinger	717821971593957376	2016-04-06T21:11:09	edzitron more quotes from you later in the podcast too it appears. Enjoy all your thoughts here you should do a podcast/video series.

AdamSinger	717813694076293121	2016-04-06T20:38:15	Up until now I've never even cared about how I looked or what I ate. Then all of a sudden my jeans didn't fit &amp; that was that. Scumbag body.
AdamSinger	717813431252824064	2016-04-06T20:37:12	Also I know how little you care about these Tweets. Reason I'm sharing =lots of people not yet in their 30s follow me. Take action now kids.

AdamSinger	717812212442660864	2016-04-06T20:32:22	What could go wrong... 
AdamSinger	717811673822662656	2016-04-06T20:30:13	Also was looking at a chart, &amp; apparently being 6ft tall &amp; 187 lbs could mean I'm overweight. But! It could also mean I'm simply undertall.
AdamSinger	717811259349999617	2016-04-06T20:28:35	Workout tips from Twitter friends =  free. I don't even need to pay a trainer. 
AdamSinger	717810972140773377	2016-04-06T20:27:26	JustEk33 I will start working out but I'm genuinely curious what % of my being fat is due to pizza / burritos before I get more active.
AdamSinger	717810863445442560	2016-04-06T20:27:00	JustEk33 it's simple math right: calories in/out. I'm just eating less and trying to live my life normally. I want to test how this works.
AdamSinger	717810675284709377	2016-04-06T20:26:15	JustEk33 coffee is a meal right? If that's so I had breakfast still.
AdamSinger	717810523954225152	2016-04-06T20:25:39	womanaroundtech ohhhh that was a good pun.
AdamSinger	717810238733221888	2016-04-06T20:24:31	Day 4: skipped breakfast &amp; went for a quick 20 minute morning exercise so I could have bagel + lox for lunch. Also down 2 pounds already!

AdamSinger	717797137740730368	2016-04-06T19:32:28	This is good news too, 16 year olds &amp; drunk drivers behind the wheel both terrifying. 
AdamSinger	717796145032859649	2016-04-06T19:28:31	AustinJ Postmates haha I am curious, I don't use them yet so tell me what's so good and I'll try :)

AdamSinger	717793295749939200	2016-04-06T19:17:12	PeterNikolow cast the GA app? 
AdamSinger	717764076927983616	2016-04-06T17:21:06	Solid move, so many trolls on Reddit blocking very necessary. Way worse than Twitter on its worst day. 
AdamSinger	717747507715899392	2016-04-06T16:15:15	_chrismarin go work for them &amp; help :)
AdamSinger	717746392110764032	2016-04-06T16:10:49	_chrismarin service works great for my uses, I am very happy user. Don't see a reason to complain personally so much value here.
AdamSinger	717743815071703040	2016-04-06T16:00:35	Pharmdca yes sir. Time to switch strategies now playing the XBI bounce was smart but it's getting too easy. 
AdamSinger	717741355062038529	2016-04-06T15:50:48	_chrismarin they have to know / are working on it.
AdamSinger	717733869701562369	2016-04-06T15:21:04	Anyway I wouldn't put much weight in what vocal minority say (remember everyone saying FB would go away too). Twitter coming into their own.
AdamSinger	717733295111319552	2016-04-06T15:18:47	Not just marketing gurus, even tech gurus (god I hate that word) &amp; early adopters fluff the next thing. But that's just what they do.
AdamSinger	717732352072359936	2016-04-06T15:15:02	carltonreid davewiner realDonaldTrump that's not the point.
AdamSinger	717732208300023808	2016-04-06T15:14:27	Now that gurus are gone, real people across interests/sectors are here &amp; get tons of value. My brother not even in tech/finance &amp; loves it.
AdamSinger	717731688919347200	2016-04-06T15:12:24	Value of Twitter for active users insanely high. But not for marketing types that just shout links or try to do personal branding nonsense.
AdamSinger	717731367883186178	2016-04-06T15:11:07	Meanwhile, been listening to marketers talk about Twitter. IE this:  &lt;-headline shows they don't get it either IMO.
AdamSinger	717730962704961537	2016-04-06T15:09:30	Is still nothing in the world like Twitter Snap/Insta are not competition in the product sense just the attention sense. TWTR better anyway.
AdamSinger	717730415860166656	2016-04-06T15:07:20	AdamSinger -- and most of the news people. trump is the poster boy for "sources go direct." cc MattAtMIT
AdamSinger	717730167372668928	2016-04-06T15:06:21	Trump compares Twitter to owning his own newspaper:  &lt;-I love how even Trump gets it and (most of) Wall St doesn't.
AdamSinger	717728365210243072	2016-04-06T14:59:11	sugarrae dohertyjf yup just focus on the business and make sure people can find you / you have great experience. Done. Also WP is free!
AdamSinger	717726782888128512	2016-04-06T14:52:54	sugarrae dohertyjf even worse is a certain company that advocates *every* SMB should have a blog and do the inbound marketing thing. sigh

AdamSinger	717564700343537664	2016-04-06T04:08:50	rrhoover lol indeed but hey it's better data viz. If you can visualize it better I will vote for your solution :-)
AdamSinger	717564502825431040	2016-04-06T04:08:03	kubakostecki glad it works for you. Public markets are as slow or fast as you want, do both!
AdamSinger	717564179977277440	2016-04-06T04:06:46	rrhoover how they should be designed ... 
AdamSinger	717562693956288512	2016-04-06T04:00:52	10,000 millionaires left France last year. That + the huge brain drain. So sad to see what is happening to my home.. 
AdamSinger	717562631968710657	2016-04-06T04:00:37	kubakostecki personally don't have patience for angel stuff have my own projects that generate passive $. I invest with shorter horizon.
AdamSinger	717561796635271169	2016-04-06T03:57:18	kubakostecki decided I wanted to take gains in 2 things I was up 25% in today. Took me 2 clicks. Easy. Love liquidity :)
AdamSinger	717561538379452417	2016-04-06T03:56:17	kubakostecki yeah if you're just throwing $ into a pick or syndicate GL!
AdamSinger	717561319067631618	2016-04-06T03:55:24	MichaelCarusi ahh I see what you're saying -- yes of course am talking about the not having kids part (responding to Howard).
AdamSinger	717561083108700160	2016-04-06T03:54:28	kubakostecki it's all risky - also for that type of investment you will not see a return for a long time - most prob never.
AdamSinger	717560832268374016	2016-04-06T03:53:28	Biotech &amp; tech investing in 2016, so far, in one video: 
AdamSinger	717560262933549057	2016-04-06T03:51:12	MichaelCarusi hah, I am not having kids dude.
AdamSinger	717560158386315264	2016-04-06T03:50:48	fazalashfaq that is the likely explanation. Someone prob told lots of these people "hey you should be on this it makes you look important."
AdamSinger	717559993994764288	2016-04-06T03:50:08	kubakostecki interesting - good luck to them, very risky!
AdamSinger	717558611476672513	2016-04-06T03:44:39	fazalashfaq yeah would be interesting, I haven't look at what kind of data is available just ended up on this page. # seems high right?
AdamSinger	717558207359660032	2016-04-06T03:43:02	I'm still not sold personally but do think it's a nice thing for Twitter to do. 
AdamSinger	717557784863240193	2016-04-06T03:41:22	Are there really 1,941,459 angel investors or just that many people on Angel List? Also so many Stanford people ...

AdamSinger	717425916788342784	2016-04-05T18:57:22	Even I find title of "social media manager" or "VP social marketing" not great. You want to be a [title] of digital / digital marketing.
AdamSinger	717425663716634624	2016-04-05T18:56:22	A. it's limiting, you are going to get pigeon-holed internally and then externally. B. you are seen as super tactical. Not good.
AdamSinger	717425549577035776	2016-04-05T18:55:54	While this may work for this brand, bit of professional advice: you'd never want your title or role tagged to a single platform.

AdamSinger	717404849353007105	2016-04-05T17:33:39	dohertyjf I just hate the buzzword growth included with anything I think. What does it mean? It's all our job's to grow the company :)
AdamSinger	717403941311414272	2016-04-05T17:30:02	dohertyjf hah, is easier as consultant. I never didn't get my way. Harder in house but it's your job to find way if resource constrained.
AdamSinger	717403634158309376	2016-04-05T17:28:49	dohertyjf mattermarkdaily I guess it depends on company, maybe a big enterprise team might be able to hire for this but not everyone can.
AdamSinger	717403356159827969	2016-04-05T17:27:43	dohertyjf mattermarkdaily always worked for me as consultant. Wrote it into client agreements &amp; just hired PT work if they didn't provide.
AdamSinger	717403023991906304	2016-04-05T17:26:24	dohertyjf mattermarkdaily but you don't need this buzzword to accomplish that. Just my opinion. We're arguing semantics most likely here.
AdamSinger	717402937786441728	2016-04-05T17:26:03	dohertyjf mattermarkdaily to be fair, I was managing developers who I tasked with I guess you could call "growth engineer" tasks.
AdamSinger	717402765278912513	2016-04-05T17:25:22	dohertyjf mattermarkdaily have worked on many enterprise sites with millions of pages / VPM and we optimized w/o "growth engineer."
AdamSinger	717402392417841152	2016-04-05T17:23:53	dohertyjf mattermarkdaily GetCredo you don't need decided "growth engineers" just a bit of developer time you negotiate is sufficient.
AdamSinger	717402109923033088	2016-04-05T17:22:46	dohertyjf mattermarkdaily GetCredo  they are not but they are project managers and should know enough code to be dangerous.
AdamSinger	717401235834310656	2016-04-05T17:19:17	mattermarkdaily dohertyjf GetCredo everything described is what good digital marketer does already. Growth engineer unnecessary buzzword.

AdamSinger	716800103852285953	2016-04-04T01:30:36	Meanwhile -- the worshiper of said celeb doesn't even know the person in real life. I find this all very strange and unhealthy.
AdamSinger	716799679220961281	2016-04-04T01:28:55	The insane part of celeb worship is that some people actually feel personally offended if you dare criticize something they do.

AdamSinger	716797056979841024	2016-04-04T01:18:30	Sorry, for all of *history up until now, music was gift of commons until commoditized by a garbage industry - but you get the idea.
AdamSinger	716796802104557568	2016-04-04T01:17:29	With that, if art is your passion and you do it for ♥ you win no matter what. For all of humanity music was created not by "pros" but by us.
AdamSinger	716796600492777474	2016-04-04T01:16:41	I've seen enough real artists as adults struggle / be unhappy to see the pattern. The world doesn't value art, plain and simple.

AdamSinger	716781477602537472	2016-04-04T00:16:36	(Not to say you should buy every IPO just b/c you know the brand or that you should hold them blindly into spikes ..but you guys know this).
AdamSinger	716780702260330496	2016-04-04T00:13:31	Not overly bullish, market has bid up every strong consumer brand @ IPO b/c fewer good IPOs. SHAK GPRO VA FIT.

AdamSinger	715640144351526914	2016-03-31T20:41:21	CarolineYLChen yup you get some nutrients w/cold pressed. More than other methods. But still less than fresh. Processing removes nutrients.
AdamSinger	715639806844252161	2016-03-31T20:40:00	DrDreSay RobertLustigMD also their juice is cold pressed not the same as juicing fresh- nutrients lost bc cold pressing is processed food.
AdamSinger	715639432661958656	2016-03-31T20:38:31	nikillinit good luck to them you are far too optimistic about this idea.
AdamSinger	715639287300009984	2016-03-31T20:37:56	DrDreSay fruit juice not good, my man RobertLustigMD explains:  ...vegetable is.
AdamSinger	715639124879757312	2016-03-31T20:37:17	.dr_pete people who juice are super geeky about juicing / health benefits &amp; actually like their juicers. At least ones I know in SF.
AdamSinger	715638896462172160	2016-03-31T20:36:23	CarolineYLChen taking clean, fresh vegetables and putting them into the juicer directly. Cold pressing not the same 
AdamSinger	715638356525252608	2016-03-31T20:34:14	Silly as buying a machine that makes soda. Easier to just buy the soda if you want it. Solutions in search of problems that don't exist.
AdamSinger	715638133325312000	2016-03-31T20:33:21	Anyway good luck, this product is as far as I can tell no different than purchasing any of the organic juices at your local store.
AdamSinger	715637975439122432	2016-03-31T20:32:43	Not to mention fruit juicing is bad for you (removes the healthy part). Vegetable juicing is good. But has to be unprocessed.
AdamSinger	715637736229576704	2016-03-31T20:31:46	Friend explained that there's always nutrient loss in processing. No way around it. If you want full benefits you HAVE to have raw fruit.
AdamSinger	715637305264836608	2016-03-31T20:30:04	You ruin point of fresh juice with *any* cold pressing / pasteurization / processing! The whole point is it is *fresh* fruits &amp; vegetables.
AdamSinger	715637075345743872	2016-03-31T20:29:09	Real reason - and I learned this from friend that's an exec at a company that sells those organic cold press juices at the store ...
AdamSinger	715636873050193921	2016-03-31T20:28:21	I actually don't think it's the $700 price tag. That's expensive but isn't the real reason it will eventually fail.
AdamSinger	715636566790524928	2016-03-31T20:27:08	Watch the Juicero intro video, &amp; then come back here and I'll tell you secret why the product is doomed from start: 
AdamSinger	715635715946717185	2016-03-31T20:23:45	The $700 'Keurig for Juice' is too expensive to solve a very real problem
