GingerGibson	692169110298427392	2016-01-27T02:15:50	The Trump campaign has now played the "please don't touch the protesters" recording twice.
GingerGibson	692167779567407104	2016-01-27T02:10:33	Trump is now 40 minutes late for Iowa City rally. The crowd is sizable and starting to get tired.
GingerGibson	692166091943100416	2016-01-27T02:03:50	And the first protester at the Trump rally in Iowa City is an older woman with an anti-racism sign. 
GingerGibson	692161001203093504	2016-01-27T01:43:37	At the Trump rally in Iowa City. It's basically the most liberal place in Iowa. So could see some protesters. Sizable crowd here.
GingerGibson	692150101322665985	2016-01-27T01:00:18	ChrisMegerian I don't know. Pro-Cruz.
GingerGibson	692144417914949633	2016-01-27T00:37:43	A local reporter shows us his mail from just yesterday.  They are mostly pro-Cruz. 
GingerGibson	691833191414525952	2016-01-26T04:01:01	Why did CNN pick this ad to have Clinton respond to? That was stupid. He ran a contrast ad. Why not use that?
GingerGibson	691830896417202178	2016-01-26T03:51:53	Clinton name drops Tom Harkin, who is sitting in the town hall audience.
GingerGibson	691829259552342016	2016-01-26T03:45:23	This format is good for Clinton. She can deliver complete answers. She is a little on the a soap box.
GingerGibson	691828978894639104	2016-01-26T03:44:16	Clinton finds her answer to Sanders' attack on Iraq War vote meaning she lacks judgement. Says Obama "trusted my judgment"
GingerGibson	691828155733164033	2016-01-26T03:41:00	Delivered very enthusiastically too.  
GingerGibson	691826057759047680	2016-01-26T03:32:40	Clinton's answer to question that young people don't like her: Let me tell you about all the things that happened before you were born.

GingerGibson	691825357947822080	2016-01-26T03:29:53	That settles it. Clinton couldn't sit, she stands to take questions.
GingerGibson	691823087034220545	2016-01-26T03:20:52	Okay, if you thought that question was that O'Malley's supporters should just give up now, you should read how the voting process works...
GingerGibson	691822480462368768	2016-01-26T03:18:27	If a candidate isn't viable in a precinct, those voters have to move to another candidate or they don't get to vote. That's how it works.
GingerGibson	691822320378351616	2016-01-26T03:17:49	O'Malley says his supporters should "hold strong" if they are viable after first vote at caucus. But that's not how it works, actually...
GingerGibson	691822004245241857	2016-01-26T03:16:33	Sanders says he wants to "do more in the farm bill to reduce the price of entry." There are three more years to it has to be passed again!!
GingerGibson	691820071728107520	2016-01-26T03:08:53	But I'm not sure he ever gave a definitive answer on the draft...  
GingerGibson	691819613001220096	2016-01-26T03:07:03	Here is a softball question (because maybe no one knows exactly what else to ask Martin O'Malley??)....
GingerGibson	691816560386793472	2016-01-26T02:54:55	Some cheers for Martin O'Malley when he takes off his suit jacket and rolls up his sleeves to answer voter questions.
GingerGibson	691813516634886144	2016-01-26T02:42:50	It's kind of awkward to ask the questioners what they think of the answers. DemTownHall
GingerGibson	691812427508355077	2016-01-26T02:38:30	I'm not really sure pointing out that Clinton is to the right of Obama on guns is an effective attack line.
GingerGibson	691812290170077185	2016-01-26T02:37:57	Sanders trying to push back on gun criticism. Says Clinton was critical of Obama for being too strict on guns, isn't running ads in Iowa.

GingerGibson	691810965147537408	2016-01-26T02:32:41	Sanders stands to give his Clinton response. But it's an answer we've heard before: His vote on Iraq War makes him more qualified to be prez
GingerGibson	691810791603998720	2016-01-26T02:32:00	Sanders responding to Clinton ad decides he must stand to deliver his answer.
GingerGibson	691809288541597696	2016-01-26T02:26:02	Bernie Sanders argues that lifting minimum wage and expanding Social Security will help women more than men.
GingerGibson	691807373145591809	2016-01-26T02:18:25	Bernie Sanders won't say he's for "big government." Clearly realizes that is too politically toxic to utter. DemTownHall
GingerGibson	691807068873998336	2016-01-26T02:17:13	There is the shouty Bernie Sanders we all know and have come to expect. DemTownHall
GingerGibson	691806057556021248	2016-01-26T02:13:11	But one must wonder Paul's poll numbers might be better served spending 5 minutes shaking hands at a Pizza Ranch...  
GingerGibson	691804619169775616	2016-01-26T02:07:28	Bernie Sanders sounds less shouty than normal.

GingerGibson	691681265100144641	2016-01-25T17:57:19	A number of heads nodding for Clinton as she speaks before crowd that isn't necessarily backing her.
GingerGibson	691681024238075905	2016-01-25T17:56:21	Clinton "it’s a little unusual for a candidate for president to say we need more love and kindness and that’s exactly what we need"
GingerGibson	691680345855508481	2016-01-25T17:53:39	Clinton says "only a two-state solution" can solve the problems between Israel and the Palestinians.

GingerGibson	691679920636952576	2016-01-25T17:51:58	Clinton in Iowa "We need a president who understands and can do all parts of the job." @ Jewish… 
GingerGibson	691679332431962112	2016-01-25T17:49:38	Clinton is really struggling through coughing and sounds like some throat problems to get back on the speech.
GingerGibson	691679126621655040	2016-01-25T17:48:49	Clinton interrupts her speech to find some water and a throat lozenge as she is unable to stop coughing.
GingerGibson	691677579137433604	2016-01-25T17:42:40	Clinton says "When you’re in the White House you cannot pick the issues you want to work on, you’ve got to be ready to take on every issue"

GingerGibson	691665560455778304	2016-01-25T16:54:54	iDanSimpson You want to have dialogue, and your response is to call me dishonest. That's not dialogue. That's name calling.
GingerGibson	691664683544219649	2016-01-25T16:51:25	iDanSimpson I understand your point. It's not about who has more experience, it's about who is making an experience argument. Sanders isn't
GingerGibson	691663568882786304	2016-01-25T16:46:59	iDanSimpson We may have to agree to disagree. I think it's a fair description. You can disagree.
GingerGibson	691662454867230720	2016-01-25T16:42:34	iDanSimpson You seem to be confused. I was assigned to follow her around that day. That's my job. Not an endorsement. An assignment.
GingerGibson	691426475011108864	2016-01-25T01:04:52	The only way this would be better is if SenatorCarper donned the colonial-era costume he wears from time to time❄️

GingerGibson	691332557015793664	2016-01-24T18:51:40	Trump just connected Keystone Pipeline being Canadian and Cruz being from Canada. It was watching him have an epiphany on live television.

GingerGibson	691001412109512704	2016-01-23T20:55:49	The fact that Grassley is even here tells you the GOP realizes it can no  longer ignore Trump's momentum and crowds
GingerGibson	691001532884631554	2016-01-23T20:56:18	This crowd is very pro-Cruz. But they're not anti-Trump. And the Trump attacks by Beck aren't getting a lot of reaction from the crowd.

GingerGibson	689602090809692161	2016-01-20T00:15:25	Trump just blasted the Palin endorsement to his list. Not a single link takes you to a donation page. Remarkable in the campaign world.

GingerGibson	689572146096533504	2016-01-19T22:16:25	Sanders, in Iowa, is arguing his vote for the gun liability law was actually in part supporting some gun control, like banning certain ammo.

GingerGibson	689562414166179840	2016-01-19T21:37:45	Trump's whole campaign is about telling voters other people really like him (see reading his poll numbers). Palin is another data point.

GingerGibson	687849370151079937	2016-01-15T04:10:44	When is this debate ending again??
GingerGibson	687849031020580864	2016-01-15T04:09:23	GingerGibson it's cause they're 10 mins over...running short on material
GingerGibson	687848803433496576	2016-01-15T04:08:29	Rubio already say word for word that "you're not going to get into America" line during this debate.
GingerGibson	687848093492985860	2016-01-15T04:05:39	And the crowd thins again.  
GingerGibson	687847479270834178	2016-01-15T04:03:13	Why is this not over yet?
GingerGibson	687847789309620224	2016-01-15T04:04:27	It appears those were "we want Rand" chants coming from the audience.
GingerGibson	687847073861865472	2016-01-15T04:01:36	Trump "If I become president I couldn’t care less about my company, it’s peanuts"

GingerGibson	687845247922106368	2016-01-15T03:54:21	Rubio with the logic on Cruz's proposal to abolish the IRS. "There has to be some agency that is collecting your VAT tax."
GingerGibson	687845013489893376	2016-01-15T03:53:25	AveEuropa I even just wrote a short story. I'm firing on all cylinders tonight.
GingerGibson	687842017313959936	2016-01-15T03:41:31	Is the abolishing the IRS proposal by Cruz an assumption that no one will ever cheat on their taxes again? It's an honor system?
GingerGibson	687841570394079232	2016-01-15T03:39:44	The room boos Trump for that line criticizing Bush. His voters will be cheering him watching at home.
GingerGibson	687840923292692480	2016-01-15T03:37:10	Uh, so Rubio understands that's the point of a tariff right?
GingerGibson	687839071452950529	2016-01-15T03:29:48	Why didn't Carson complain this time about his frequency of questions?
GingerGibson	687838729923330048	2016-01-15T03:28:27	Like a laser. Drink.
GingerGibson	687838506132090880	2016-01-15T03:27:33	This is the be afraid, be very afraid portion of the debate.
GingerGibson	687838357842489344	2016-01-15T03:26:58	Why haven't I heard anyone complain about the NSA listening to people yet? What's missing? Something is missing...?
GingerGibson	687837630483066881	2016-01-15T03:24:05	It's time for my regular debate PSA: If you feel like predicting something is going to hurt Trump, just stop and delete your tweet.
GingerGibson	687836685963505665	2016-01-15T03:20:19	Did anyone think Trump was going to be like, "Well, actually after some thought and discussions, I've decided..."?? No.
GingerGibson	687835467702759426	2016-01-15T03:15:29	Please stop asking Carson foreign policy questions. It's cruel.
GingerGibson	687835696808198145	2016-01-15T03:16:24	Says a man who has publicly vowed not to support Trump.  
GingerGibson	687833049581662208	2016-01-15T03:05:52	Think Trump can only be the loudest voice in the room? Wow. We just saw a bit of his range.
GingerGibson	687832449586466816	2016-01-15T03:03:29	Clearly no one told Cruz that realDonaldTrump plays Cats and Phantom of the Opera at his rallies as well.
GingerGibson	687831783749087232	2016-01-15T03:00:51	Fast and Furious reference. Finish your drink and consume a second.
GingerGibson	687830340870651904	2016-01-15T02:55:07	When Donald Trump sounds like a Democrat, criticizing states for closing public health care systems. "We're closing hospitals."
GingerGibson	687829672231628801	2016-01-15T02:52:27	Definitely not the voters.

GingerGibson	687825285077549060	2016-01-15T02:35:01	I don't know who was winning that Trump/Cruz exchange, but whoever was losing it owes Rubio for ending it.
GingerGibson	687823935602204672	2016-01-15T02:29:40	Can someone send me the argument that a candidate's parents had to be born on Americans soil? Where did that come from?
GingerGibson	687822027798003712	2016-01-15T02:22:05	For the current audience, Ted Cruz just answered all he needed to on questions about his loan. The explanation is lagniappe.
GingerGibson	687820874217570304	2016-01-15T02:17:30	Carson starts by complaining about the times he hasn't gotten questions before. Does that resonate with anyone?

GingerGibson	687820218949890048	2016-01-15T02:14:53	Jeb is starting off by focusing on Clinton and not Trump. Clinton under investigation by FBI is music the right's ears.
GingerGibson	687818526753689600	2016-01-15T02:08:10	Cruz just took an line from Trump, saying that Obama should be blamed for the picture of troops with hands on their heads in Iran.
GingerGibson	687817378902626304	2016-01-15T02:03:36	Everyone's a [media] critic.

GingerGibson	687449598047080448	2016-01-14T01:42:11	Dozens of people sitting behind Trump are leaving their seats, likely headed to the floor. Sound is terrible. No one can understand him.
GingerGibson	687447511334793220	2016-01-14T01:33:53	If I won the lottery, I would run for president just so I could pick a song that would play every time I walked into a room.

GingerGibson	687332727343943681	2016-01-13T17:57:46	I'm just going to say, if it were surrogates attacking, question would be where are staff, family and candidate?

GingerGibson	687105395937034241	2016-01-13T02:54:26	Obama is consistently swiping at Republican presidential hopefuls without calling them out by name. This is targeted at realDonaldTrump
