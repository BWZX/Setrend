msuster	723496191984472065	2016-04-22T12:58:28	impressivist of course if your broaden the definition of COGS ... but giving away customer incentives is marketing not COGS
msuster	723496006478753792	2016-04-22T12:57:44	JFC. You lose money on each order but "make it up on volume" - that's the oldest joke in the book.

msuster	723494541714542592	2016-04-22T12:51:55	Please everybody study what Gross Margin is. If you do a startup you need to understand below isn't Gross Margin. 
msuster	723494163509960705	2016-04-22T12:50:25	WizKaliko And I raised my kids on it. And I grew up with Prince as he became a superstar. Sad

msuster	723026330539843584	2016-04-21T05:51:25	gregcohn in fact, my only goal is to inform founders of the risks. 99.9% of these founders I will never meet. no ulterior motive :)
msuster	723006187310972928	2016-04-21T04:31:22	gregcohn dwaxd that is patently not true. many entrepreneurs do the best they can. many "optimize"
msuster	723005828840607746	2016-04-21T04:29:57	gregcohn dwaxd of course if you don't have options you take what you can get. you very well know that some with options choose easy path

msuster	722850366686044161	2016-04-20T18:12:11	teehalljr no interest. had this debate 100s of times
msuster	722850236821934080	2016-04-20T18:11:41	Proud to be very high (#2) on list of % of female founders backed (with a few more unannounced) 
msuster	722849355414114304	2016-04-20T18:08:10	I was talking about equity crowdfunding, not pre-orders on products 
msuster	722847287135772672	2016-04-20T17:59:57	My lesson:  I only invest if at least one person is on board to represent capital.  Don't care if it is me. 
msuster	722846680144420864	2016-04-20T17:57:33	sarahcuda yeah, i guess that was the point I was trying to make. it just took me much longer as usual :)
msuster	722844870394556416	2016-04-20T17:50:21	we're overdue for a correction on the whole lack of oversight/board thing. my board ABSOLUTELY made me stronger 
msuster	722844459730227200	2016-04-20T17:48:43	sarahcuda agreed VCs denigrate. but the narrative still too persistent amongst founders that crowd funding or note deals better for them
msuster	722843929788284928	2016-04-20T17:46:37	RobFreelen oversight means having board members who ask tough questions about the business, strategy, team, financing, etc
msuster	722843773646966784	2016-04-20T17:46:00	RobFreelen he had strong investors and a board
msuster	722842477879689216	2016-04-20T17:40:51	_jacksmith yes. the single biggest problem in the mentality of inexperienced founders
msuster	722842343301230593	2016-04-20T17:40:19	jenslapinski vkhosla vinod is great. he can have influence without a board seat. that doesn't imply no board members = good
msuster	722841963880271873	2016-04-20T17:38:48	RobFreelen zuck had strong investors who helped him attract sheryl sandberg. the combo is why it's an amazing company
msuster	722841759504424961	2016-04-20T17:37:59	kcm yes
msuster	722841571394072576	2016-04-20T17:37:15	_jacksmith true in the short term. but good governance is a hard to perceive thing until later when you see the effects
msuster	722832493062131712	2016-04-20T17:01:10	Investors who take board seats 
msuster	722831947932643328	2016-04-20T16:59:00	14/ And get objective opinions not just recent fundings. It early days it’s Saul Goodman. Find out how the season ends
msuster	722831839551836160	2016-04-20T16:58:34	13/ My advice: seek advice from founders who have hit the backside of leaderless rounds over past 5 years
msuster	722831794966437889	2016-04-20T16:58:24	12/ The market is the market so leaderless rounds will continue for some time. As founders just consider long-term consequences
msuster	722831746836738048	2016-04-20T16:58:12	11/ Rank-and-file employees (99% of company) benefit from better governance at board level but aren’t aware of how this can impact them
msuster	722831586308132869	2016-04-20T16:57:34	10/ If you want examples of hard early days read Googled by Ken Auletta or history of Apple, Twitter.
msuster	722831529131413504	2016-04-20T16:57:20	9/ If always up &amp; to the right leaderless rounds work. Things are never always up &amp; to the right
msuster	722831470776070150	2016-04-20T16:57:06	8/ Convertible notes: kick-can-down-road on governance &amp; reporting = less sunshine on decision making. Sunshine is harder but better results
msuster	722831362621726720	2016-04-20T16:56:41	7/ Oversight is why democracy trumps autocracy in the long run
msuster	722831176772091904	2016-04-20T16:55:56	6/ Oversight helped build management teams, figure out monetization &amp; raise capital. Oversight a pain. But interactions drive performance
msuster	722830879484043265	2016-04-20T16:54:45	5/ Industry’s best companies benefitted from strong oversight in early years: Google, Facebook, Twitter.
msuster	722830832507879424	2016-04-20T16:54:34	4/ Leaderless rounds often no professional governance, reporting &amp; decision-making frameworks. Hurts company, employees &amp; investors
msuster	722830783749038080	2016-04-20T16:54:23	3/ False illusion that it’s in founder or employee interests. Strong investor = commitment, neck-on-line, owns good times &amp; bad
msuster	722830685115785217	2016-04-20T16:53:59	2/ Leaderless round trend led by rise of angels, explosion of seed funds &amp; crowd funding. Easy short-term money, not always good long-term
msuster	722830548826107905	2016-04-20T16:53:27	1/ One seldom debated trend of last 5 years was the rise of “leaderless rounds,” which I believe are a net negative for the industry
msuster	722824119612379136	2016-04-20T16:27:54	StookBo no. time &amp; frequency does
msuster	722824006416470016	2016-04-20T16:27:27	And. In the "be careful what you wish for" category ...

msuster	718889179472461824	2016-04-09T19:51:51	AdamSinger TProphet it takes 5 minutes to figure out then it's pretty intuitive
msuster	718884157720408066	2016-04-09T19:31:54	AdamSinger TProphet this should save you some time :) 
msuster	718880433648193536	2016-04-09T19:17:06	Dan_Tamkin it has captured it very well, grown very fast. expectations are high cuz compared to fb

msuster	718820644347973632	2016-04-09T15:19:31	aweissman but I also try to do authenticity &amp; access to "VC life" or "my life" every 6th or 7th
msuster	718820530032287745	2016-04-09T15:19:04	aweissman thanks, andy. i try to balance not talking about myself all the time. feels narcissistic. i try to impart knowledge

msuster	718544457017102336	2016-04-08T21:02:03	The nicest thing about ad hominem attacks is that they make social media blocking decisions so much easier BuhBye
msuster	718543979415908352	2016-04-08T21:00:09	josephjeong yes. But some more so than others
msuster	718543758510325760	2016-04-08T20:59:16	wtbryce in the wrong direction. Policy ideas anti globalization which is unrealistic. Can't roll back NAFTA - need to take wealth to retool
msuster	718536909962809344	2016-04-08T20:32:03	Exactly. I felt the same 
msuster	718534177637974016	2016-04-08T20:21:12	I have never "felt the Bern" - this left-leaning op ed articulates many of the reasons why

msuster	717737584391274496	2016-04-06T15:35:49	Yo! startuplawyer : you should weigh-in on some of these snapstorms by msuster . Even make some of your own. 
msuster	717580330052362240	2016-04-06T05:10:57	Tbizi nobody should be allowed to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.
msuster	717580096371081216	2016-04-06T05:10:01	CortneyWoodruff I don't live in SV and not defending. But any views one has doesn't justify Mississippi legislated discrimination

msuster	717574519087497218	2016-04-06T04:47:51	2/ sure politicians must be able to understand the basics of demographic shifts &amp; movements towards tolerance
msuster	717574296982282244	2016-04-06T04:46:58	1/ I'm at a loss to understand Southern states rush to deny LGBT people = rights. What is the driver of this hate?

msuster	716745459042095104	2016-04-03T21:53:28	Siofra_Flood doh. Fixed. Thank you. Deleted old which may screw up your tweet
msuster	716745279630811136	2016-04-03T21:52:45	7/ mostly I think if a seed fund wants an observer seat they should take full seat with legal responsibilities and admins. Why a free pass?

msuster	716740721303269376	2016-04-03T21:34:39	The way msuster uses Snapchat is a game changer. His snaps are full of knowledge. Much easier than reading long blog posts. Snap: Msuster.
msuster	716741114942717953	2016-04-03T21:36:12	8/ Remember: since nothing voted people who speak often have influence whether legal board members or not. Know what you're signing up for
msuster	716740512254808064	2016-04-03T21:33:49	6/ and strategics talking means same role as official board member. Sometimes that's good. Sometimes it's very, very bad
msuster	716740357183045634	2016-04-03T21:33:12	5/ strategics - try to agree private briefings vs board observers if possible. They deserve info - but attending mtgs adds scheduling hassle
msuster	716740135946063872	2016-04-03T21:32:19	4/ junior VC observer can be very helpful. Allow but without legal "right" and if asked they stay silent (literally)
msuster	716739970510159873	2016-04-03T21:31:40	3/ most board observers are: strategics, junior VCs or seed funds (not wanting admin or legal responsibility) - each is a unique case
msuster	716738743168737281	2016-04-03T21:26:47	2/ I discuss why Board Observers can be bad for boards and when to say yes on Snapchat today - live now
msuster	716738474582237184	2016-04-03T21:25:43	1/ Startup boards rarely take consequential votes. Thus board observers = board members &amp; make decision-making harder. Don't accept lightly

msuster	708393859479306240	2016-03-11T20:47:12	@Nikhitaaaa i think my wife sometimes wishes I did :)
msuster	708393569338327040	2016-03-11T20:46:02	azeem yes
msuster	708393377515966464	2016-03-11T20:45:17	Love it! He's right 
msuster	708393037999656960	2016-03-11T20:43:56	12/ If I could give one strong piece of advice to SaaS companies who have a great product: Implementation Matters -&gt; 
msuster	708392672440881152	2016-03-11T20:42:29	11/ It's another area where I think VC advice goes astray. Lost in theoretical battle over margins they undervalue long-term client success
msuster	708392485765054464	2016-03-11T20:41:44	10/ Another huge milestone is when companies recognize  need for professional services to implement products &amp; deliver success vs. software
msuster	708392265782140928	2016-03-11T20:40:52	9/ I saw this a few years ago at DataSift and other companies. Such a pivotal transition.
msuster	708392123968520192	2016-03-11T20:40:18	8/ 6 months ago MakeSpace took on  challenge to build a sales &amp; marketing culture. The results have been astounding. Super proud to watch
msuster	708391791226007552	2016-03-11T20:38:58	8/ And I love watching teams buck the advice that "marketings is evil" that sometimes permeates Silicon Valley
msuster	708391563076874241	2016-03-11T20:38:04	7/ On the flip side: it's super heartening when teams discover a "sales culture" and see the fruits of customers happily buying products
msuster	708391332159422465	2016-03-11T20:37:09	6/ I credit dickc with really embracing and building Twitter into an amazing business, even if it still is solving some product issues
msuster	708391146125307905	2016-03-11T20:36:25	5/ Eventually every company comes to the realization it must make money. Even Google struggled with this
msuster	708391042324647936	2016-03-11T20:36:00	4/ It's painful to watch the narrative that only product/eng people should lead tech startups destroy amazing products and teams
msuster	708390872765693952	2016-03-11T20:35:19	3/ I have seen some really fantastic companies fail to "level up" by broadening their skills from product to sales, marketing, finance, ops
msuster	708390605378879488	2016-03-11T20:34:16	2/ The best product / eng led startups realize the need to develop a full set of mgmt skills / team. Sadly some never do
msuster	708390403922223104	2016-03-11T20:33:28	1/ The challenge with many tech startup companies is they're often founded by brilliant product or eng people lacking some "company" skills

msuster	702392410639310848	2016-02-24T07:19:35	When Snapchat launched "stories" it became much more useful to me. I show interested people "daily life of a VC"

msuster	698573669967069184	2016-02-13T18:25:16	hunterwalk tristanwalker fmanjoo rabois sentiment matters but strong voices don't change it: see nouriel roubini. Read "black swan"
msuster	698570521546326017	2016-02-13T18:12:45	JRMjunior1 that's simply bullshit
msuster	698570316428148736	2016-02-13T18:11:56	tristanwalker fmanjoo rabois zero. That's the most common myth
msuster	698537326788476928	2016-02-13T16:00:51	A agree with this. Rational VCs don't like paying higher multiples than public markets where they get exits 
msuster	698536948193824768	2016-02-13T15:59:21	mdudas rabois at early stages 2x too high was common. 3x for some people. That has massively corrected
msuster	698536492692430852	2016-02-13T15:57:32	thogge wrong
msuster	698536324416950272	2016-02-13T15:56:52	Exactly right  
msuster	698536211921506304	2016-02-13T15:56:25	What Jeff said ... 
msuster	698536073102688257	2016-02-13T15:55:52	No. And people who make this argument often haven't studied economics. Laws of supply / demand: my next blog post 
msuster	698528847814225921	2016-02-13T15:27:10	It got zero votes ;) 
msuster	698528658709880832	2016-02-13T15:26:24	Exactly. And VCs are neither of these  
msuster	698528484637802497	2016-02-13T15:25:43	Not herd mentality. Just opinion / data. Measure of "sentiment" - ignore at your peril  
msuster	698528189228822528	2016-02-13T15:24:32	.mdudas rabois I see what's happening on inside. Goal is to inform people not on inside so if we help realism more will get funded vs die
msuster	698527862198960129	2016-02-13T15:23:15	.mdudas rabois I think it is "naive" so I'll stick with that. We can't control prices: see "Bin38" &amp; when prices drop out portfolio hurts
msuster	698527065721565184	2016-02-13T15:20:05	.rabois gregisenberg here is private / blind VC survey I did of trusted VC friends. 30% predict sharp correction 
msuster	698526502636249088	2016-02-13T15:17:50	What Keith said. Naive when entrepreneurs think VCs trying to "talk down values" Trying to help / inform what we see

msuster	696365565061963776	2016-02-07T16:11:03	DanielleMorrill many companies are making the problem worse by pouring on huge amounts of unsophisticated capital at inflated prices
msuster	696365168125562880	2016-02-07T16:09:28	DanielleMorrill of course that's not what I said Danielle. I said I think it will produce healthier companies long term: scrutiny is good

msuster	696127317597261824	2016-02-07T00:24:20	bobscirpo offline sync, constantly advertising subscriptions, so many menu options. it's a piece of shit. i don't have to justify more

msuster	696124305151651840	2016-02-07T00:12:22	Thank you waltmossberg for saving me time of blogging how bad Apple software has become. An excellent review:

msuster	696121677084643329	2016-02-07T00:01:55	rui yes, that is the worst thing about it. even for songs i already bought

msuster	696119887102607360	2016-02-06T23:54:49	msuster last version of itunes was bad but sort of painfully usable. current version is just terrible. have stopped using entirely.
msuster	696118173708341248	2016-02-06T23:48:00	jasonlk shhhh. let me have my little market. kthxbye
msuster	696115406541488129	2016-02-06T23:37:00	msuster Biggest deterrent from switching to iOS was Apple Music. I miss Android's Google Music integration, Apple Music does not compete.
msuster	696117675584454656	2016-02-06T23:46:01	True, which I don't think bodes well for their future. Still, this was a CORE product. Amazing Apple Music so bad

msuster	696114834597752834	2016-02-06T23:34:44	Apple Music is easily the worst software I use. If I were an exec there I'd be deeply embarrassed &amp; have a huge team working to fix my shame

msuster	687436583583281152	2016-01-14T00:50:28	9/ And because so many investors inexperienced people get excited by VR experience itself vs. understand what additional IP is added
msuster	687436405107257346	2016-01-14T00:49:45	8/ Most VR pitches I see these days have very limited true innovation / IP. I see the future &amp; excited by it. But too much $$, too quickly

msuster	687435351443554304	2016-01-14T00:45:34	4/ When everybody is looking to fund in a category all at once (the wave) I tend to get pretty skeptical
msuster	687435116973551616	2016-01-14T00:44:38	3/ "Waves" are fueled by VCs who then decide they want to fund in "themes" and announce their themes. Fund themes. Lose money. Hate category

msuster	683329942449356800	2016-01-02T16:52:08	7/ These days few of my friends &amp; peers actually dialog on Twitter except people like semil hunterwalk joshelman &amp; people like that
msuster	683329646889320448	2016-01-02T16:50:58	6/ I also think much could be done with smaller Twitter groups like Slack channels. In early days so many of us "chatted" on small Twitter
msuster	683328906607263744	2016-01-02T16:48:01	5/ The more Twitter truly knew about me the better content it could serve, recommended people to follow, etc
msuster	683328694228615169	2016-01-02T16:47:10	4/ Surely for marketers or 3rd-party applications Twitter knowing much more about users will improve Ad ROI / targeting: Also benefits users

msuster	683328235116060673	2016-01-02T16:45:21	2/ For example - to share on Twitter I had to find out JKCorden &amp; IAMJHUD vs. FB I just type @ their name. Why?
msuster	683327934774431744	2016-01-02T16:44:09	1/ I'm a huge fan of Twitter. I want to see them 10x. To do so I think they need to capture much more user info like LI &amp; FB.
