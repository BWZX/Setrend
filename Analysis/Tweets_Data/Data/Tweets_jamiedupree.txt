jamiedupree	707521536970854400	2016-03-09T11:00:54	In percentage terms, Trump won 49% of March 8 delegates, Cruz 39%, Kasich 11%, Rubio &lt;1%
jamiedupree	707520780746231808	2016-03-09T10:57:53	welsh0311 This is all about momentum - and when Rubio did not do that well on Super Tuesday, thing went sideways fast

jamiedupree	707440827933585408	2016-03-09T05:40:11	noisyparker IshYimini Then you can make the argument that Kasich did the same to Rubio in Maine and Idaho too
jamiedupree	707438814474706944	2016-03-09T05:32:11	Cruz ahead of Kasich by 6k votes for second place in Michigan with 95% of precincts reporting
jamiedupree	707438331471273985	2016-03-09T05:30:16	At this point, Rubio has no delegates; maybe Hawaii, which is proportional with no threshold

jamiedupree	707437779819630592	2016-03-09T05:28:04	Right now, Trump has 48% of tonight's delegates, Cruz 39% and Kasich 13%
jamiedupree	707436941910941700	2016-03-09T05:24:45	danielworkman No - we were all wrong about that.  If Cruz &amp; Trump the only ones &gt;20%, then around 19-13 or 18-14
jamiedupree	707436718518095872	2016-03-09T05:23:51	danielworkman If Rubio were to get to 20% in Idaho, it would take delegates out of both Cruz &amp; Trump

jamiedupree	707434955551449088	2016-03-09T05:16:51	(AP) -- Ted Cruz wins Republican presidential primary in Idaho
jamiedupree	707434506945499136	2016-03-09T05:15:04	IshYimini Check your facts.  Rubio got no delegates in Maine. And the 3 he won in Texas all came from Trump
jamiedupree	707431800520482821	2016-03-09T05:04:19	You can see all the polls that showed Sanders was ahead in Michigan (none!) 
jamiedupree	707426202626215937	2016-03-09T04:42:04	17% from Idaho - Cruz 38.7%, Trump 31.6% and Rubio 18.2%
jamiedupree	707425094851813376	2016-03-09T04:37:40	Margie1820 Margie - I'm not so sure about that now - maybe it is 50% of the vote, not the delegates.
jamiedupree	707424874327896064	2016-03-09T04:36:48	Delegate rules are just too confusing - early GreenPapers take on Idaho with Rubio &lt;20% is Cruz 18-14 over Trump

jamiedupree	707422845861797889	2016-03-09T04:28:44	I think the odd rules in Idaho mean that if only 2 candidates get &gt;20%, then the winner takes all 32 delegates
jamiedupree	707422228552544256	2016-03-09T04:26:17	If Rubio drops under 20% in Idaho, wouldn't that give Cruz a backdoor WTA of the delegates??
