JoeMysak	685644442003451904	2016-01-09T02:09:08	So I'm headed uptown on the subway with jjdoran, and we're as the song goes, `a little bleary, a little worse for wear and tear'
JoeMysak	685644034132541441	2016-01-09T02:07:31	MikeStanton2012 ey?
JoeMysak	685643675179835392	2016-01-09T02:06:05	This was 1991, maybe 1992. The bankers at First Boston (remember them?) wanted to yell at us about something we'd run in the little paper.
JoeMysak	685643389937803265	2016-01-09T02:04:57	I'll just close with another little journo story, showing how journalists are poetically inclined, some of them.
JoeMysak	685641039101706240	2016-01-09T01:55:36	He wrote: 'For Joe Mysak, who listens so patiently that he will become a psychiatrist or a Buddha.' I interviewed him for my college paper.
JoeMysak	685640559206215680	2016-01-09T01:53:42	I interviewed Heywood Hale Broun back in, it must have been 1977, 1978. And I brought a copy of his book, `A Studied Madness' to inscribe.
JoeMysak	685639244837163009	2016-01-09T01:48:29	My first thought is always: Tell me what you know. Some reporters think their first duty is to argue. Very curious.
JoeMysak	685638849318502401	2016-01-09T01:46:54	MikeCraft6 Big box!
JoeMysak	685638367191642112	2016-01-09T01:44:59	And I'll always say, Well, what do we have here? Some reporters, I know, immediately think: Attack the source. This surprises me.
JoeMysak	685636819518648320	2016-01-09T01:38:50	I think it's happened to me 3 times. Never a disappointment, either.
JoeMysak	685636568468582400	2016-01-09T01:37:51	This happens, EVEN IN MUNILAND. A person comes in and brings, or sometimes mails, a Box of Stuff, and you think Thank you, God
JoeMysak	685636300146372609	2016-01-09T01:36:47	One of the things I loved about the movie `Spotlight' -- the source who comes in with a Box of Stuff
JoeMysak	685517758436630528	2016-01-08T17:45:44	It would be very effective at some points during the day to have backup singers.

JoeMysak	684812150129487877	2016-01-06T19:01:54	Does Chicago really need co-disclosure counsel, co-municipal advisors, co-bond counsel.....?
JoeMysak	684761493909450752	2016-01-06T15:40:37	But I don't want a `Penn Redo.' I want the original Penn RR Station back. They have the plans.

JoeMysak	684709189512523776	2016-01-06T12:12:46	Will the muni market suffer politically because of its (relative) investor concentration? That's a hitherto unexplored danger
JoeMysak	684442419027390464	2016-01-05T18:32:43	Man, those Michigan school districts all seem pretty intent on crowding into the market, ey?
JoeMysak	684434909461655552	2016-01-05T18:02:53	Still searching for a theme song. You know, like when EMK would take the stage, and they'd play the Bee Gees' `Massachusetts'

JoeMysak	684423947987894274	2016-01-05T17:19:19	There's a MUNI angle to most stories; editors just don't want to admit it.

JoeMysak	684243245413580800	2016-01-05T05:21:16	One aspect of these events (Chicago, Detroit, Harrisburg, Jefferson County, PR) that surprises me is how long they can carry on for.

JoeMysak	681143726228553728	2015-12-27T16:04:54	Certainly after NYC in 1975, Treasury et al were cognizant that states functioned as responsible adults, as indeed NY did with NYC
JoeMysak	681143368026615808	2015-12-27T16:03:28	In re: NYT edit: one could make the argument that Puerto Rico is LIKE a state, and hence, no access to chapter 9.
