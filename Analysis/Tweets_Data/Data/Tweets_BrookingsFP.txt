BrookingsFP	725372432257785857	2016-04-27T17:13:59	Trump - The US is strongest when the US is prosperous. We must make America strong and wealthy again. We must make US respected again.
BrookingsFP	725371816219430912	2016-04-27T17:11:32	Trump - Americans must know if we go abroad, we'll put US interests first. We'll reject globalism, trade deals, sending US jobs overseas.
BrookingsFP	725371221001510913	2016-04-27T17:09:10	Trump - The world must know that we will not go abroad in search of enemies. Too much destruction out there.

BrookingsFP	725365722893959169	2016-04-27T16:47:19	Trump - North Korea has been able to pursue nukes unchallenged. China has been allowed to take US jobs. Not effective US policy in Asia.

BrookingsFP	725363867950419968	2016-04-27T16:39:57	Trump - Current US foreign policy has no direction. Trade deficit has undermined US standing in the world, with overspending overseas.

BrookingsFP	719631880287559680	2016-04-11T21:03:05	Thanks for following our event with JamesTraub1 and Robert Kagan on American foreign policy realism - then and now. A fascinating debate!
BrookingsFP	719631579526651904	2016-04-11T21:01:53	Kagan - Adams believed there were enough monsters at home (South's slave owners) than bigger monsters overseas. Guided his foreign policy.
BrookingsFP	719630986267533312	2016-04-11T20:59:31	.JamesTraub1 - Difficult to apply Adams' realist principles to today. Not sure if he would have cut deal with Putin to keep Assad in power.
BrookingsFP	719630157921824768	2016-04-11T20:56:14	Kagan - Promoting liberal international order is critical to US interest. Will it cause problems at times?  Sure, but ultimately good.
BrookingsFP	719629431472578560	2016-04-11T20:53:21	Kagan - During the Cold War, we believe containment was a good strategy, but containment got us into Vietnam.
BrookingsFP	719629072335269891	2016-04-11T20:51:55	Kagan - Realism in foreign policy was driven by concern about centralized power. Needed guiding principles to counter one leader's agenda.
BrookingsFP	719628274364784641	2016-04-11T20:48:45	.JamesTraub1 - Realism is a moral doctrine.  Says action based on moral passions leads to wrong decisions, bad national behavior.
BrookingsFP	719627821774217216	2016-04-11T20:46:57	Kagan - War of 1812 gave a huge boost to US nationalism, growth of US military power. Start of South's concern about North's domination.
BrookingsFP	719627111124885505	2016-04-11T20:44:07	.JamesTraub1 - Starting in the 1840s, foreign policy was not huge factor in US elections. US no longer a play-thing of European conflicts.
BrookingsFP	719626492590878720	2016-04-11T20:41:40	Kagan - Since that time, the US has swung back and forth between intervention and isolation. Question now is, where are we today?
BrookingsFP	719626134867079168	2016-04-11T20:40:15	Kagan - The question after Word War II was whether the US needed to stay in Europe to maintain the newly created liberal world order.
BrookingsFP	719625788656656388	2016-04-11T20:38:52	Kagan - However, by the early 1940s, realities on the ground changed and intervention became critical. A different moral reality set in.
BrookingsFP	719625403560804354	2016-04-11T20:37:20	Kagan - The realist position in the 1930s was that it did not matter to the US who lead Europe and the cost of stopping Hilter was too high.
BrookingsFP	719625082558144512	2016-04-11T20:36:04	Question - Is foreign policy realism based on pursuit of interests and whether the US has the power and should act on those interests?
BrookingsFP	719624075568680960	2016-04-11T20:32:04	Kagan - While Adams was not expansionist, he did believe that Cuba would eventually have to be brought into the United States fold.
BrookingsFP	719623415657799681	2016-04-11T20:29:26	Kagan - Realists believe that nations try to acquire and use power at all times. Adams did not take that approach on moral grounds.
BrookingsFP	719622967383179265	2016-04-11T20:27:40	Kagan - There was constant intervention on ideological grounds during Adams' time, but not by the US. US had to pick its enemies back then.
BrookingsFP	719621186293010432	2016-04-11T20:20:35	Happening now: fascinating debate btwn Bob Kagan &amp; JamesTraub1 over whether JQA was a foreign policy realist. Follow along at BrookingsFP.
BrookingsFP	719622453639692288	2016-04-11T20:25:37	.JamesTraub1 - Adams was a prudent realist based on the factors of his time. However. his realism would not bar any and all intervention.
BrookingsFP	719622020988854272	2016-04-11T20:23:54	.JamesTraub1 - A student asked me if Adams would have gone into Libya as President Obama did not. No Adams would not have gone into Libya!
