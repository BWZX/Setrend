joshk	724973729873174528	2016-04-26T14:49:41	joshk to learn more on the art of the pick read  natsturner zachweinberg nail it (I can intro you if you want ;)
joshk	724972449763328000	2016-04-26T14:44:36	10/ A startups outcome is clearly not pre-ordained from the pick, but picking is a critical (&amp; often ignored) skill for both founders &amp; VCs
joshk	724972342628225024	2016-04-26T14:44:10	9/ Observation #3) VC's often diligence founders based on track record in starting/scaling a startup - not whether they are a good picker.
joshk	724972274684706816	2016-04-26T14:43:54	8/ Observation #2) In my experience, serial entrepreneurs are more likely to rush the pick due to high self-confidence &amp; easy access to $$.
joshk	724972198780391425	2016-04-26T14:43:36	7/ Observation #1) Many founders rush "the pick". If you're spending the next 5-10 yrs of your life doing something, pick your idea wisely.
joshk	724972100675620864	2016-04-26T14:43:12	6/ Most founders spend &lt;5% of their time on idea selection, yet I believe that "the pick" accounts for &gt;50% of startup success/failure
joshk	724971936619610116	2016-04-26T14:42:33	5/ The typical founder spends their time either: PICKING an idea, STARTING a company (hunting for PMF), or SCALING a company (growing)
joshk	724971799470084097	2016-04-26T14:42:00	4/ While VC's probably spend less than 5% of their actual time on the picking, I believe the "pick" creates well over 80% of the return.
joshk	724971678367928320	2016-04-26T14:41:32	3/ The typical VC spends most of their time doing one of three things: SOURCING companies, PICKING companies or HELPING companies.
joshk	724971528035688448	2016-04-26T14:40:56	2/  But I think that startup founders have to be even BETTER pickers than VCs. VCs can pick dozens of companies, founders pick one at a time
joshk	724971287068684288	2016-04-26T14:39:58	1/ Everyone knows that a VC's job is to "pick" amazing founders and companies.  The best VCs are great pickers.
