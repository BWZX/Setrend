AlexKoppelman	698699664611274753	2016-02-14T02:45:55	"OK, but how would you actually do that?" is basically the question of this entire campaign.
AlexKoppelman	698698142582181889	2016-02-14T02:39:53	On foreign policy Trump is the MoveOn activist's id on the stage tonight.
AlexKoppelman	698697701958033408	2016-02-14T02:38:07	Man, Trump's stripes as an old Democrat are really showing tonight. (Not that it'll matter, but.)

AlexKoppelman	697804523562262528	2016-02-11T15:28:57	abeaujon MatthewWells I admit I would like that headline better if they just cut out the comma.
AlexKoppelman	697803335123005441	2016-02-11T15:24:14	jonswaine MatthewWells Fine, fine, it's a bad headline. But Wells' jingoistic America-bashing forced me into defending it.
AlexKoppelman	697795710486515712	2016-02-11T14:53:56	MatthewWells I don't fully get that reference. But agreed that it doesn't need the "others." Commas can be useful, though!

AlexKoppelman	696174939007815680	2016-02-07T03:33:34	Even by the standards of a Michael Moore movie this Michael Moore movie looks horrendous.
AlexKoppelman	696174564150222849	2016-02-07T03:32:05	Well, that was inane.
AlexKoppelman	696169190701580288	2016-02-07T03:10:43	So we're all pretending Christie's reaction to Ebola wasn't totally out of proportion, I guess?
AlexKoppelman	696168231275491328	2016-02-07T03:06:55	Trump on police mistreatment was like a master class on incoherent pandering. GOPDebate

AlexKoppelman	696164384456974336	2016-02-07T02:51:38	That was a very good answer by Cruz except for the whole policy part of it.

AlexKoppelman	696159972481245184	2016-02-07T02:34:06	Of course they don't ask Trump how he's going to take the oil because why would we want specifics in this debate
AlexKoppelman	696158203835510784	2016-02-07T02:27:04	Ted Cruz is, for the record, describing something not wholly dissimilar from the Obama admin's air strike strategy.
AlexKoppelman	696158046179979264	2016-02-07T02:26:26	Even among a group of people who specialize in not answering the question asked, Ted Cruz is masterful at it.
AlexKoppelman	696156494153281536	2016-02-07T02:20:16	The question of whether Obama is a moron or the most evilest person in the world is the most pressing issue of this election apparently?
AlexKoppelman	696151420916076545	2016-02-07T02:00:07	"Socialized medicine doesn't work," Cruz says, which is good since Obamacare isn't socialized medicine.
AlexKoppelman	696150833977827328	2016-02-07T01:57:47	FYI, Chris "I'm a governor" Christie's approval rating is, to use the Jersey vernacular, shit: 
AlexKoppelman	696150166726930432	2016-02-07T01:55:08	Wait, is Chris Christie a governor?
AlexKoppelman	696149922765271040	2016-02-07T01:54:10	It'd be fun if Raddatz asked each candidate how many people Obama had deported, multiple choice.

AlexKoppelman	696143134883979264	2016-02-07T01:27:11	Really hoping ABC keeps this trend of not asking anything about policy at all going, because that's super useful for voters.
AlexKoppelman	696142152791941121	2016-02-07T01:23:17	That's what you get for being nice to Donald Trump, people.
AlexKoppelman	696141943529730048	2016-02-07T01:22:27	Reminder: Not answering questions is EXACTLY how Ted Cruz gets extra time in debates 
AlexKoppelman	696141042932961281	2016-02-07T01:18:52	OK, let's all just agree to end the debate now because it clearly can't top this.
AlexKoppelman	696140593962074113	2016-02-07T01:17:05	Great start for Ben Carson, the clear winner already.
