tomashirstecon	719434189066616832	2016-04-11T07:57:31	Higher share of inc -&gt; top earners = more capital leakage meaning either higher debt or smaller spend needed to fund same scale of services.

tomashirstecon	718073270168330240	2016-04-07T13:49:43	GavinHJackson MayfairCynic it's only consistent if you think government shldn't have a position on Brexit. Which is fine, but it does.
tomashirstecon	718071448464711680	2016-04-07T13:42:29	GavinHJackson MayfairCynic we can always object/disagree about how the gov spends money - but not question that it can in this case.
tomashirstecon	718071185574137856	2016-04-07T13:41:26	GavinHJackson MayfairCynic it would be a perfect way of illustrating the hypocrisy, yes. But they could do it.

tomashirstecon	718068020220968960	2016-04-07T13:28:51	GavinHJackson MayfairCynic not comparable IMO - not a new position.

tomashirstecon	716917151597215744	2016-04-04T09:15:43	Had a discussion with DuncanWeldon on this very subject recently:  gavyndavies
tomashirstecon	716916884042551296	2016-04-04T09:14:39	Unsurprisingly, agree with gavyndavies - debate reflects a failure to understand/agree on what we want to measure. 
tomashirstecon	716905589092327424	2016-04-04T08:29:46	The ZLB that matters - interest rates on (overnight) corporate deposits, still positive on average.

tomashirstecon	715589325891698690	2016-03-31T17:19:24	M_C_Klein really disagree. Imagining TSITF as defined by full self-sufficiency is not a base case that I would deem reasonable.
tomashirstecon	715588735430209537	2016-03-31T17:17:04	M_C_Klein GVA not the sole role played by the banking system though. Systemic importance runs somewhat deeper.
tomashirstecon	715588193782013952	2016-03-31T17:14:55	M_C_Klein why pretend that "bad things" here not somewhat quantifiable?
tomashirstecon	715588025053552640	2016-03-31T17:14:14	M_C_Klein because it's a small, uncompetitive industry that accounts for a modest share of output.
tomashirstecon	715586420983918592	2016-03-31T17:07:52	M_C_Klein which is a very different argument. I'm not unsympathetic given how poor the record is on regeneration.

tomashirstecon	715584422960087040	2016-03-31T16:59:56	M_C_Klein think that stretches definition too far. Distinction to make here is where failure would be hugely disruptive to civil society.
tomashirstecon	715583574381105152	2016-03-31T16:56:33	M_C_Klein pretty sure we didn't bail out banks because they were strategic assets. UK steel not TBTF.

tomashirstecon	715487010710880256	2016-03-31T10:32:51	JoMicheII Yes, I would reckon so (on average).
tomashirstecon	715485554104610816	2016-03-31T10:27:03	JoMicheII I don't think 0 but do think it will close substantially. My guess: CA deficit is price UK pays for being large financial centre.
tomashirstecon	715481169828032512	2016-03-31T10:09:38	JoMicheII Why would you think it would stick around that level though? Can't see any compelling reason in MT
tomashirstecon	715480210825588737	2016-03-31T10:05:49	JoMicheII Why worry unless you think it's structural though? Seems like a hiding to nothing

tomashirstecon	715479031924154368	2016-03-31T10:01:08	JoMicheII That's a bit of a straw man in my experience. Far more doomsayers than people dismissing figures.
tomashirstecon	715478794560143361	2016-03-31T10:00:12	JoMicheII Worth asking whether investment income has taken a structural hit. Seems doubtful to me.
tomashirstecon	715478343655628800	2016-03-31T09:58:24	JoMicheII I think case you make should give us pause, but don't really see there's much of a reason to panic. These are extraordinary times

tomashirstecon	711846839285366784	2016-03-21T09:28:06	JoMicheII Yeah, I broadly agree. Have been making the case for some time: 
tomashirstecon	711845403189182464	2016-03-21T09:22:24	JoMicheII IMO that's right. Explains why too much labour bargaining power leads to wage/price inflation, too little limits potential output
tomashirstecon	711843459397754880	2016-03-21T09:14:40	JoMicheII Should really have said "potential wage growth". For fuller picture have to include:

tomashirstecon	710808118641500160	2016-03-18T12:40:36	Birdyword JoMicheII DuncanWeldon Yep, but IME given that so much of that wealth is tied up most people's exps don't differ all that much.
tomashirstecon	710807118702575616	2016-03-18T12:36:37	Birdyword JoMicheII DuncanWeldon Well, yeah, we should also have c.100% IHT and stronger welfare system.
tomashirstecon	710806159280758785	2016-03-18T12:32:49	DuncanWeldon JoMicheII Could argue if you're right, we're probably not mismeasuring the kind of inflation that we should care about though
tomashirstecon	710805011245170688	2016-03-18T12:28:15	DuncanWeldon IMO this is tech uotpian-type argument. If price falls do not increase consumption elsewhere prob it's distributional problem.
tomashirstecon	710804562035273728	2016-03-18T12:26:28	DuncanWeldon IMO income constraints are really binding, and so people aren't foregoing spending just b/c they're consuming more free music
tomashirstecon	710804356380102657	2016-03-18T12:25:39	DuncanWeldon This argument only works if you think firms effectively storing up future demand so have higher NPV than markets realise IMHO
tomashirstecon	710803831144259589	2016-03-18T12:23:34	DuncanWeldon e.g. Moore's law-type price falls should be reflected in increased consumption elsewhere.
tomashirstecon	710803312073908224	2016-03-18T12:21:30	DuncanWeldon This *may* hold true re: softer happiness measures etc but seems highly unlikely to be v important for real econ metrics.

tomashirstecon	710802595871379457	2016-03-18T12:18:39	Basic problem with this is that economists very much can account for "dazzling consumer gains from tech &amp; competition" and, in fact, do.

tomashirstecon	698061108230385664	2016-02-12T08:28:32	Zettel314 GavinHJackson Depends whether you think physical cash is a genuine constraint. Certainly a worry for e.g. German landesbank.
tomashirstecon	698060673213972480	2016-02-12T08:26:48	Zettel314 GavinHJackson So far most banks have been taking the hit on margins rather than passing them on to depositors.

tomashirstecon	691630481629188096	2016-01-25T14:35:31	M_C_Klein greg_ip but not convinced low discount rate plays the critical role in that dynamic. May be wrong.
tomashirstecon	691630265723174912	2016-01-25T14:34:39	M_C_Klein greg_ip So the claim is abdication of fiscal responsibility + fostering perverse incentives of fin sector can -&gt; fin instablity
tomashirstecon	691628333122068480	2016-01-25T14:26:59	M_C_Klein greg_ip And even then, extent to which fin stability risks crop up depend on lots of other variables
tomashirstecon	691627783395622912	2016-01-25T14:24:48	M_C_Klein greg_ip Right, but only channel isn't mon pol and fx depreciation isn't off the menu.

tomashirstecon	691625304675196928	2016-01-25T14:14:57	greg_ip Not obvious that low rates inevitably leads to financial excess. Possible that combination of labour/savings glut meant Fed was 1/2

tomashirstecon	684010570224386049	2016-01-04T13:56:42	georgepearkes Would argue that the extent of subsidy provided by QE depends upon the fungibility of the asset at the time of the purchase.
tomashirstecon	684007960847233024	2016-01-04T13:46:20	georgepearkes Given cost of capital constraints the ability to move MBS off out of originators' portfolios was a de facto subsidy.
tomashirstecon	684007444889124865	2016-01-04T13:44:17	georgepearkes Yes. But given problems facing mortgage originators in '09, providing a buyer-of-first-resort did act to support the system.
tomashirstecon	684006892004327424	2016-01-04T13:42:05	georgepearkes I don't think you can equate the two scenarios entirely.

tomashirstecon	684005330364268545	2016-01-04T13:35:53	georgepearkes Certainly diff, but IMO in order for it not to be a subsidy you have to believe there was no market dysfunction in MBS in '09
tomashirstecon	684003710914158592	2016-01-04T13:29:27	georgepearkes If it isn't a subsidy (defined here as public sector risk bearing) then it's hard to see how it could have been stimulative.
tomashirstecon	683988071260491776	2016-01-04T12:27:18	georgepearkes So agree majority of stimulus of MBS purchases came via stabilising OAS calculations. But we also agree Fed provided subsidy?
tomashirstecon	683986146335047680	2016-01-04T12:19:39	georgepearkes Sure, I accept that. But balance of those risks shifted over time during GR.

tomashirstecon	683973647669817345	2016-01-04T11:29:59	Pete_Spence UnlearningEcon OK. Bearing risk might be more accurate.
tomashirstecon	683973202675150848	2016-01-04T11:28:13	Pete_Spence UnlearningEcon In U.S. extension of QE to MBS presumably offered a similar incentive?
tomashirstecon	683972557796671488	2016-01-04T11:25:40	Pete_Spence UnlearningEcon Agree. Bailout was to prevent collapse. But funding for lending a public subsidy aimed at promoting growth, no?
