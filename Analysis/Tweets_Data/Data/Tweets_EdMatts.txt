EdMatts	710817825577836545	2016-03-18T13:19:10	No not really.. DAX loop is very predictable/profitable now.. But have a hunch how it will continue..differently. .  
EdMatts	710816537666580480	2016-03-18T13:14:03	Roots have just repeated DAX all month. The Mandlebrot probably cant shrink any more.

EdMatts	710797363988840448	2016-03-18T11:57:52	NickGiva I dont see why people think of God as so old fashioned. He gave Moses a tablet. with at least 10 apps.
EdMatts	710796059254067200	2016-03-18T11:52:41	NickGiva lol I heard Murdoch was trying Him out at the Sun before moving him to Sky. Apparently Google want Him for the Cloud.
EdMatts	710794512310910976	2016-03-18T11:46:32	NickGiva Does He get paid for that? Is that what Grantham meant by the Paradigm shift.. the financialisation of God? (thunderbolt coming..)
EdMatts	710793522740400129	2016-03-18T11:42:36	NickGiva It probably was the decisive moment in the Falklands war when He read 'Argie Bastards'.
EdMatts	710792274339368961	2016-03-18T11:37:38	NickGiva No need if you invite Michael Gove. It will be in the Sun next day.. Kindof appropriate if God had a column in the Sun lol
EdMatts	710791977172934660	2016-03-18T11:36:27	NickGiva  read that as doubling... thought for a second He had a managed account.  ;)

EdMatts	710776596890779648	2016-03-18T10:35:20	If God were an Englishman.... how would He vote in Brexit ?
EdMatts	710773976339972096	2016-03-18T10:24:56	NickGiva I think 'God' might carry a few extra pounds lol
EdMatts	710772714605256704	2016-03-18T10:19:55	NickGiva Could be much worse.. Rather than super power...could be wall flower. But we still punch well above our weight.

EdMatts	710533061746814977	2016-03-17T18:27:37	AN77M11 No.. I mean what I say. As SPX fades and DAX opens strongly,, EURUSD should fall.
EdMatts	710511010545856513	2016-03-17T17:00:00	If my view is right that DAX will reopen aggressively (as before) and SPX starts to fade.. then watch out EURUSD.

EdMatts	710090853402939392	2016-03-16T13:10:26	DAX now 16GMT March 9th.. All about DAX volatility in NY now.. Odds shifting in favor of range trade :(  
EdMatts	710089957415768066	2016-03-16T13:06:53	MatejDurisin I do an update daily for DAX but generally not by video.. takes much longer to do
EdMatts	710057037636440065	2016-03-16T10:56:04	Is FOMC the trigger for greater volatility in Oil? Update shows  how we are trading the new position through FOMC. 
EdMatts	710055821665837056	2016-03-16T10:51:14	Joecool2005 So FOMC average and my 'view' allows volatility into FOMC.. otherwise straight copy of tight bullish NFP / ECB range into FOMC.
EdMatts	710055272371372032	2016-03-16T10:49:03	Joecool2005 You mean for DAX? Yes. Hence my comment about volatility now. If you look at white FOMC average it supports the forecast.
EdMatts	710047262932598784	2016-03-16T10:17:14	DAX is now around NY open March 9th.. This is where pre FOMC volatility is key.

EdMatts	709732734076325889	2016-03-15T13:27:24	Just beware DAX has a real March 4th-9th feel about it.. sideways whip chop whip.

EdMatts	709689009807728641	2016-03-15T10:33:39	And as Churchill said.. "War is mainly a catalogue of blunders."  
EdMatts	709661148807864320	2016-03-15T08:42:57	GBPUSD retraced to uptrend support. MVTV video explains what this means in middle of the BRange. Pre-Brexit Range. 
EdMatts	709658971381100544	2016-03-15T08:34:18	DAX has been producing this story line for many years. Update shows where we will reverse yesterday's shorts.

EdMatts	709419472893972480	2016-03-14T16:42:37	Once again the NFP fractal nailed the SPX. Now moving onto the Yellen (FOMC) Fractal as a key driver of US markets. 
EdMatts	709417430641205248	2016-03-14T16:34:30	tennis6399 Mind you Boris Johnson / Donald Trump summits would be interesting.
EdMatts	709416658381762560	2016-03-14T16:31:26	tennis6399 The problem is that Washington is not just the Capitol of the US.. its a focal point for geopolitics.
EdMatts	709415493090856960	2016-03-14T16:26:48	tennis6399 Marginally less fascinating than the potentially divisive US elections in November.
EdMatts	709414541281640448	2016-03-14T16:23:01	Again SPX - DJIA divergence but (without the futures/cash divergence) is different to the post ECB top.  Update still good. :)
EdMatts	709407407462608896	2016-03-14T15:54:40	We probably regret the day a year ago I first coined the EURUSD Mangle. Today's video shows forewarned is forearmed. 
EdMatts	709400351359832064	2016-03-14T15:26:38	Put it down to a warped sense of the market.. in other words reality rather than textbook.  
EdMatts	709373031915909121	2016-03-14T13:38:04	Oil bulls may have won last week but something needs to change before the barrel rolls again. Update shows what. 
EdMatts	709307452798459904	2016-03-14T09:17:29	GBPJPY and AUDUSD are now trading pretty much in line short term..  Just as well strategy is pretty much the same... ie Fade this week

EdMatts	709301457900670976	2016-03-14T08:53:40	Interesting DAX has now hit the orthodox 10040 pre-ECB triangle target..to suggest ECB was just one big outlier.. 
EdMatts	709298063387586561	2016-03-14T08:40:11	Definitely not..  
EdMatts	709296427562868737	2016-03-14T08:33:41	Is DAX jumping or flying?  One thing we can be sure of.. Not many have caught it. Update reviews the long strategy. 
EdMatts	708948260841463808	2016-03-13T09:30:11	Now Benitez is a Toon General for a Toony army.. but possibly too late for an effective rearguard action. Good Luck

EdMatts	708345390190477312	2016-03-11T17:34:36	Yesterday was quick decapitation day..  Today is slow capitulation day.  spx  Starting to exit 1969 long above 2020. (in 1/4s).
EdMatts	708324240995524608	2016-03-11T16:10:33	I think SPX has caught DAX up all the way to 13:00GMT 8EST. which suggests SPX will soon lead the day (and possibly be THE lead market).

EdMatts	705771118372720640	2016-03-04T15:05:21	pm1889 Welcome but unfortunately most the serious trades   are advanced...  eg AUDUSD.
EdMatts	705770886553542658	2016-03-04T15:04:26	pm1889 No. not quite.. I hope.. means downward pressure on the Open should fade for a rally.. But update covers the rest.

EdMatts	705731485773471746	2016-03-04T12:27:52	I think you're right and a slightly worse NFP dumped the Indices. But market was long (not short like it has been) 
EdMatts	705730085228249088	2016-03-04T12:22:18	AUD market little less short after new highs but no longer complacent.  Still looking possibly to trim long b4 NFP.

EdMatts	705518534760210434	2016-03-03T22:21:41	None. We have been in aversion to risk aversion.   RiskOffOff. Sell defensive stocks and buy  bear targets.

EdMatts	705510994638979076	2016-03-03T21:51:43	Why do you think SPX has kept rallying into NFP? Because the market has been short.  Price ≠ Positions. Position = Positions.

EdMatts	705468415729860608	2016-03-03T19:02:31	Is AUDUSD going to break 0.7380 before NFP?  Take stops and longs will probably say thank you and cover.. But after NFP is the issue...
EdMatts	705461392107814912	2016-03-03T18:34:37	DJIA and SPX feel and look like yesterday.  NFP is stealing volatlity.

EdMatts	704787969484390401	2016-03-01T21:58:40	Probably the only the way has been to stay stubbornly long. The Mule trade.. lol
EdMatts	704786886007640064	2016-03-01T21:54:22	I can understand anyone selling SPX in this market. Rarely have I seen such an oppressive (bearish) sentiment.
EdMatts	704786109826469888	2016-03-01T21:51:17	Such extreme bearish sentiment in SPX into NFP.  Reckon Katy Perry might make a good trader  
EdMatts	704736808215642113	2016-03-01T18:35:23	NSohal Last 90 mins of SPX shows what I mean by rising wedge.. which should be resolved with a correction back to the start of the wedge.
EdMatts	704727100952080384	2016-03-01T17:56:48	NSohal Yes I dont think its going to run easily before NFP.. so probably a wedge. Like a rising range.

EdMatts	704693292550717441	2016-03-01T15:42:28	SPX is in the same place that DAX was below 9509 this morning. Should take the stops above 1958.2 but not 1971.2.

EdMatts	702577853754417152	2016-02-24T19:36:28	NicClive2 If you mean Gold II.. Yes I find it a little scary every time I hit an SPX bid..
EdMatts	702576556217122816	2016-02-24T19:31:18	..NicClive2 You see the pink circle in the Map?.. I am not complaining.. because my strategy is unaltered. 
EdMatts	702574942370578432	2016-02-24T19:24:54	NicClive2 Timing. It consolidated for several hours after the first rally.
EdMatts	702560526199615490	2016-02-24T18:27:37	Robots have taken over DJIA.. In a loop repeating 64 minutes ago.
EdMatts	702558386102116352	2016-02-24T18:19:06	JWestJest No..I dont do much close analysis... In a 24 hour market its almost irrelevant except it influences others/sentiment.
EdMatts	702556226996084736	2016-02-24T18:10:32	SPX is following the Map. I therefore would be wary of anything above 1911 into close..5W rally..

EdMatts	702538584314802176	2016-02-24T17:00:25	In the 13 years following Britain joining the EU, GBPUSD more than halved in value..  So Brexit must be good for GBP right? ;)
EdMatts	702535726634762240	2016-02-24T16:49:04	I totally misread that.. Sounded like saying everyone in France, leave France. Come to think of it.... .  
EdMatts	702534419576442880	2016-02-24T16:43:52	mrcod72 Yes. probably.  Not sure it pays to second guess anything at the moment.
EdMatts	702533297683996672	2016-02-24T16:39:25	Out for much of today.. but fiilled on part II.  
EdMatts	702492335523889152	2016-02-24T13:56:39	After 5 Waves even Bears still have Pause. GBPUSD video shows what to expect after 1.3895 Equality Swing target. 
EdMatts	702466478797418496	2016-02-24T12:13:54	JediEconomist Anger was typical emotional response to a possibly contrived deal. But Fear could well change minds back in the actual  Poll.
EdMatts	702463616251994113	2016-02-24T12:02:31	Few believed the EURGBP 1992 template last year. Now everyone is talking Brexit, MVTV video is talking Exit $$

EdMatts	702130653589086208	2016-02-23T13:59:27	HansSchuldt VictorKerezov Always nice to be the right side of a panic. its very empowering for eventual reversal as well.
EdMatts	702129819748794368	2016-02-23T13:56:08	Yes.. we are having a vote on that in June..   
EdMatts	702128074188525568	2016-02-23T13:49:12	VictorKerezov @/HansSchuldt If you define it in sentiment. question whether it is accelerating new lows places GBPUSD one move ahead.
EdMatts	702126616982511617	2016-02-23T13:43:25	HansSchuldt VictorKerezov Irony that GBPUSD had the real reason to dump and yet EURJPY has gone further.
EdMatts	702126140253724673	2016-02-23T13:41:31	Not progressing so far...   
EdMatts	702125181909733376	2016-02-23T13:37:42	I am convinced GBP is leadng EURJPY but I can't prove or use it.. What you reckon?

EdMatts	702069437432799233	2016-02-23T09:56:12	Falling volatility and now lack of 'triggers' suggests DAX could be stuck in 9460-9560 range today.  As 9460 holds should rally 9553 later.
EdMatts	702055932214300672	2016-02-23T09:02:32	Brexit  may well be all three:  A Disastrous Decision,  then A Troubled Transition  but finally a Booming Britain.

EdMatts	701833768986873856	2016-02-22T18:19:44	starlo__  Not frequently enough.. But there are daily updates on Market Update.
EdMatts	701820085040766976	2016-02-22T17:25:22	gerttomi Kindof..but volatility constraint is different for DAX.. almost the opposite so 10pt SPX dip can translate into a 150pt DAX drop.
EdMatts	701808671177764864	2016-02-22T16:40:00	Not very often you see GBPJPY down 2% and SPX up 2% in the same 24 hour trading period.
EdMatts	701807750435704836	2016-02-22T16:36:21	VIX may be telling us something about both the SPX and Oil. Original cartoon is from 1972. Our target isn't.

EdMatts	701718056993685504	2016-02-22T10:39:56	mhewson_CMC Both sides? This referendum will probably be about how the third (too scared to leave) side jumps.  Me included.

EdMatts	701716418811846656	2016-02-22T10:33:26	owsi1968 Then you dont have a proper DAX .. EUREX is shut.  Technical problem.
EdMatts	701698777506299904	2016-02-22T09:23:20	Next hour should be very revealing for both DAX and FTSE.  DAX currently looks like a larger version of Feb 18th but FTSE supports strategy.

EdMatts	700581939292598272	2016-02-19T07:25:25	.aceoptu Yes.. because of Gold's inverted relationship to USD. But its possible Gold is leading EURUSD by 68 hours.

EdMatts	700344151913660416	2016-02-18T15:40:32	Interesting SPX - DJIA divergence suggests new LOD for S&amp;P but not DJIA could be trigger for later new HOD for DJIA but not SPX.
