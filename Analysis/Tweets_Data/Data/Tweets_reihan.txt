reihan	721354562985160710	2016-04-16T15:08:24	willgadea Great idea! Sadly, that's not quite how land-use law works, I've been told.
reihan	721354017251663872	2016-04-16T15:06:14	16. My guess is that the new Chicago proposal is pure politics, and that local planners (who want more density) weren't really consulted.
reihan	721353834006777856	2016-04-16T15:05:30	15. Getting from here to there will be challenging, hence focused proposals designed to contain local opposition: 
reihan	721353633531629570	2016-04-16T15:04:42	14. Change zoning rules to recognize that downsides of higher density not as great as we thought. Use new revenue to help poor neighborhoods
reihan	721353112380956672	2016-04-16T15:02:38	12. Concern is that if you can impose land-use restrictions *with no land-use rationale*, we might see pretty serious abuses.
reihan	721352901642334208	2016-04-16T15:01:48	11. If we have no land-use rationale for limits, all we're doing is demanding that developers pay ransom. For a good cause! In *this* case.
reihan	721352636197441541	2016-04-16T15:00:45	10. But Chicago approach really tests the limits of the land-use power. Why we have it in the first place, etc.
reihan	721352391539494913	2016-04-16T14:59:46	9. To be clear, I like idea of transferring resources to underserved neighborhoods. (This can happen in lots of ways, e.g., property taxes.)
reihan	721352209468932098	2016-04-16T14:59:03	8. So why should developers be obligated to a pay a "bribe" to exceed land-use limits that don't have a land-use justification?
reihan	721352044901175297	2016-04-16T14:58:24	7. If it's really true that we've overestimated downsides of increased density, then rationale for stringent limits is undermined.
reihan	721351898440204293	2016-04-16T14:57:49	6. Basically, proposal is saying (correctly, in my view) that we've overestimated the downsides of increased density. But there's a twist.
reihan	721351767489912832	2016-04-16T14:57:18	5. Chicago proposal seems to say that we'll allow you to build more if you pay this fee, which *won't* mitigate effects of higher density.
reihan	721351556604497922	2016-04-16T14:56:27	4. In that case, you can build more, but you'll have to pay for (e.g.) a public park or some other amenity that relates to the rationale.
reihan	721351385778941953	2016-04-16T14:55:47	3. Or you can say, "Hey, we'll allow you to build more, but only if you pay into a pot of money that will address negative externalities."
reihan	721351223954272256	2016-04-16T14:55:08	2. So if you say, "Hey, you can build more," you also need a land-use rationale, e.g., turns out congestion is not that big a deal.
reihan	721351077799575552	2016-04-16T14:54:33	1. If you're going to oppose a limit on what developers are allowed to build, you need some land-use rationale. Too much congestion, etc.

reihan	696156988670083073	2016-02-07T02:22:14	I cannot fathom why Rubio thinks this Obama-knows-what-he’s-doing thing is working.

reihan	696144993614958593	2016-02-07T01:34:34	Christie's attack on Rubio for memorized talking points is itself a memorized talking point Christie's been using on the stump, just FYI
reihan	696146501953843205	2016-02-07T01:40:34	Yup. That said, Rubio did not make a good strategic decision in his responses. 
reihan	696146334798188545	2016-02-07T01:39:54	Why is no one hitting Trump? Because everyone but Rubio benefits if Trump holds his lead and wins, letting the race reboot a bit in SC.

reihan	690550840780853248	2016-01-22T15:05:24	mattyglesias Per ElbridgeColby and Solomon, our conventional deterrence capability is (in my view) eroding:

reihan	687038917535772673	2016-01-12T22:30:17	lymanstoneky It's honestly incredible that you can make this generalization. I've reached the limits of what I can realistically do here.
reihan	687038581190299648	2016-01-12T22:28:56	lymanstoneky Right, and I believe that there is variation here. Shall we both move on?
reihan	687038436583321601	2016-01-12T22:28:22	lymanstoneky You have a very interesting take. I'm happy to leave it there. Hope you better understand how you've mischaracterized my view.
reihan	687037917500456960	2016-01-12T22:26:18	lymanstoneky This is a normative disagreement.
reihan	687037868599078914	2016-01-12T22:26:07	lymanstoneky And I believe that native-born African Americans have a more pressing claim than less-skilled migrants.
reihan	687037782628413441	2016-01-12T22:25:46	lymanstoneky Our fundamental disagreement might be that I believe people with low incomes need substantial taxpayer-financed assistance.
reihan	687037610477367296	2016-01-12T22:25:05	lymanstoneky Yes, and skilled foreign-born Hispanics have higher incomes still.
reihan	687037387373940736	2016-01-12T22:24:12	lymanstoneky I'm indifferent to whether migrants are of Mexican origin per se. Institutional quality, however, is relevant to integration.
reihan	687037173539942400	2016-01-12T22:23:21	lymanstoneky No, because the quality of institutions varies within countries as well. This is a proxy.
reihan	687037030220562432	2016-01-12T22:22:47	lymanstoneky Correct?
reihan	687037002525618176	2016-01-12T22:22:40	lymanstoneky To be clear, that is the only reason: annexing a population of 180M people with limited skills is not the issue in your view.
reihan	687036832597544960	2016-01-12T22:22:00	lymanstoneky "Hispanic" category is extremely diverse. Limit to foreign-born and gap is smaller. 10% of AAs are also foreign-born.
reihan	687036552774586369	2016-01-12T22:20:53	lymanstoneky Quality of education in Korea not identical to Philippines, etc.
reihan	687036354115547136	2016-01-12T22:20:05	lymanstoneky I care far less than you seem to about national origin, and quality of schooling varies sharply across these regions.
reihan	687035985662717953	2016-01-12T22:18:38	lymanstoneky Is it fair to say that you believe that annexing Guatemala or Bangladesh would increase GDP per capita long-term?
reihan	687035758088171520	2016-01-12T22:17:43	lymanstoneky Okay, I think the depth of our disagreement here is much clearer now.
reihan	687035052363001856	2016-01-12T22:14:55	lymanstoneky 
reihan	687034845852209152	2016-01-12T22:14:06	lymanstoneky The replenishment challenge relates to skill levels that isolate individuals with below-average skill levels.
reihan	687034690293870592	2016-01-12T22:13:29	lymanstoneky I call for reducing less-skilled immigration. 
reihan	687034076621094913	2016-01-12T22:11:02	lymanstoneky then you're advocating something distinctive, and it's not at all obvious that it is less restrictive than status quo.
reihan	687033858777346049	2016-01-12T22:10:11	lymanstoneky If your ideal regime is using language-blind Raven's Matrices and admitting everyone who is (say) above the US avg ...
reihan	687033624525451264	2016-01-12T22:09:15	lymanstoneky Elsewhere, I've explicitly said that the volume of migrants is less the issue than the skill profile of the migration.
reihan	687033542077972483	2016-01-12T22:08:55	lymanstoneky Then I'm confused about the disagreement. I explicitly state in the piece that numbers aren't the issue.
reihan	687033402894200832	2016-01-12T22:08:22	lymanstoneky On average. Obviously, there is substantial variation in both groups.
reihan	687033299303280640	2016-01-12T22:07:57	lymanstoneky And the PIAAC data is fairly clear re: foreign-born vs. native-born.
reihan	687033232412520449	2016-01-12T22:07:41	lymanstoneky I prefer not to use the language of "cognitive underperformance." The work I cite is about quality of schooling.
reihan	687033026262515712	2016-01-12T22:06:52	lymanstoneky If you believe that it would be politically acceptable to use Raven's progressive matrices as criterion, we disagree.
reihan	687032715116462080	2016-01-12T22:05:38	lymanstoneky That's not the issue. You are calling for a less restrictive policy.
reihan	687032528784502785	2016-01-12T22:04:53	lymanstoneky I strongly disagree. While such a policy might increase *income per natural,* I'd guess that it would reduce GDP per capita.
reihan	687032078618214401	2016-01-12T22:03:06	lymanstoneky You believe that allowing free migration of people with low levels of literacy/numeracy won't tend to lower GDP per capita.
reihan	687030624247504903	2016-01-12T21:57:19	Delighted to see that the (very important) Autor-Dorn-Hanson work changed ModeledBehavior's mind about something: 
reihan	687029711759904768	2016-01-12T21:53:42	lymanstoneky Further thoughts that might be of interest: 
reihan	687029478145536002	2016-01-12T21:52:46	lymanstoneky That is, I don't see Udacity-style offshoring as a disaster -- I see it as a very good thing: 
reihan	687029170354974720	2016-01-12T21:51:33	lymanstoneky that higher GDP per capita is more important than a higher GDP; and that diffusion of development is good.
reihan	687029008983310336	2016-01-12T21:50:54	lymanstoneky Yes, I'm familiar with your view. My sense that the net fiscal impact varies across migrants
reihan	687025735727509504	2016-01-12T21:37:54	lymanstoneky If you re-read the section of the article on ethnic replenishment, I think you'll see what I mean a bit more clearly.
reihan	687024067241709569	2016-01-12T21:31:16	lymanstoneky I'll reply later in the week, when I have a bit more breathing room.
reihan	687023991131869184	2016-01-12T21:30:58	lymanstoneky We're so far apart that it will take a longer exchange to work through. Feel free to email me: rsalam at nationalreview
