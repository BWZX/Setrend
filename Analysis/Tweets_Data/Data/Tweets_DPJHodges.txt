DPJHodges	725600413039398912	2016-04-28T08:19:54	Just listened to Rupa Huq interview again. She should be suspended too. Disgraceful attempt to minimise anti-Semitism.
DPJHodges	725596189379297280	2016-04-28T08:03:07	Today's Daily Mail. MPs look set to vote again on this issue on 9 May. 
DPJHodges	725595266456379392	2016-04-28T07:59:27	That appalling RupaHuq interview was the perfect demonstration of just how big Labour's problem is.
DPJHodges	725592260562292737	2016-04-28T07:47:30	Rupa Huq defends Naz Shah saying it's too easy to 'click or like' things online. 'She did not write anything antisemitism she pressed share'
DPJHodges	725415287118503936	2016-04-27T20:04:16	I got it wrong. The Naz Shah apology leaked to me was a draft under consideration, not "final" as I was told. 
DPJHodges	725569574175924225	2016-04-28T06:17:21	Lucy Powell refuses to say she'd be happy to sit alongside Naz Shah in the Commons. "I don't want to pre-determine the investigation."
DPJHodges	725359687336644608	2016-04-27T16:23:20	My former colleague DPJHodges did try to warn them back in August 
DPJHodges	725359641186684928	2016-04-27T16:23:09	thedissenter   I agree with all of that.
DPJHodges	725356444858634240	2016-04-27T16:10:27	thedissenter   Didn't say it was. But it's impossible to deal with this whilst he remains leader.
DPJHodges	725356288826298369	2016-04-27T16:09:50	MarkJDoran Thwacker71   When Boris demands the Jews are expelled from Israel it will be in my twitter feed.

DPJHodges	725354998180237312	2016-04-27T16:04:42	bencobley   Yes.
DPJHodges	725354671573970944	2016-04-27T16:03:24	HenryQuamford   Yes. Fortunately there are still a lot of people, (you're not one, of course), who do still take anti-semitism seriously.
DPJHodges	725354303750299651	2016-04-27T16:01:57	bencobley   And?
DPJHodges	725353953844682752	2016-04-27T16:00:33	.MarkJDoran  And there we have it. "Look over there!!!! Look over there!!!!".
DPJHodges	725353648570650630	2016-04-27T15:59:20	HenryQuamford    Anti-Semitisim. Your sides are still splitting at the thought aren't they...
DPJHodges	725353193627090944	2016-04-27T15:57:32	sean_longcroft   Has this emerged before his election she would have been suspended immediately.
DPJHodges	725352871353585665	2016-04-27T15:56:15	HenryQuamford  Funny this anti-Semitism stuff isn't it Henry. Really, really funny.
DPJHodges	725352523205324804	2016-04-27T15:54:52	Labour's now like Ukip. Every day another example of anti-Semtisim. And every day another attempt to brush it off as unrepresentative.
DPJHodges	725352074641297408	2016-04-27T15:53:05	kingswing72   Yes. As I say, Corbyn's election convinced many people it was now OK to be openly anti-Semitic.
DPJHodges	725351821166927872	2016-04-27T15:52:05	This is not a communications failure. It's an institutional failure. And it can't be addressed whilst Jeremy Corbyn remains Labour leader.
DPJHodges	725351358128345088	2016-04-27T15:50:14	At root of all this is a simple truth. Corbyn's election convinced many on the Left it was now morally acceptable to be openly anti-Semitic.
DPJHodges	725349510357110786	2016-04-27T15:42:54	Lot of people about to start blaming Seumas Milne for all this. Not Milne who's responsible. It's the leader of the party who's responsible.
DPJHodges	725348949335396352	2016-04-27T15:40:40	And in another twist, Labour HQ has just thrown Jeremy Corbyn's office under the bus. said they didn't amend the Shah apology.
DPJHodges	725345531233468416	2016-04-27T15:27:05	Labour HQ on Buzzfeed article: "This claim is completely inaccurate." Says apology "was not seen, written, edited or approved by Labour HQ".
DPJHodges	725347894627340290	2016-04-27T15:36:29	Mentos_Pure  Fine. The racism in front of us today is anti-Semitism. Let's focus on it.
DPJHodges	725345523218128896	2016-04-27T15:27:03	Labourpaul   No. Some of us don't think this is funny any more.
DPJHodges	725344972724121600	2016-04-27T15:24:52	pigreen1   "Oh, come on". You're being serious aren't you. You are a grown adult, and you tweeted that in all seriousness.
DPJHodges	725344287269990400	2016-04-27T15:22:08	pigreen1   Once the tweet emerged she should have been suspended. That's it.
DPJHodges	725342410369277952	2016-04-27T15:14:41	tweetasanutm8   OK, explain that one to me Geoff.
DPJHodges	725341192297275392	2016-04-27T15:09:51	Ken Livingstone on Naz Shah as she is suspended from Labour: "No I don’t think her comments were anti-Semitic." LBC
DPJHodges	725340108363292678	2016-04-27T15:05:32	And no, this doesn't reflect well on Naz Shah. Her apology wasn't sincere, it was the one the Labour press office told her to deliver.
DPJHodges	725338676713152513	2016-04-27T14:59:51	So now we know. It's official Labour party policy to try and cover up Labour and left-wing anti-Semitism.
DPJHodges	725337814104182784	2016-04-27T14:56:25	This editing of Naz Shah's "apology" is astonishing.
DPJHodges	725300428943020032	2016-04-27T12:27:52	And when we condemn anti-Semitism, can we do it without bringing in other forms of racism all the time. We can focus on one issue at a time.
DPJHodges	725299599708160000	2016-04-27T12:24:34	John McDonnell was right to swiftly force Naz Shah's resignation - but now the party has to suspend her.
DPJHodges	725335076368732160	2016-04-27T14:45:32	Mentos_Pure   How about, just for once, not shouting "look over there!!!!".
DPJHodges	725332074228551680	2016-04-27T14:33:37	jeegarkakkad  No. But Labour clearly thinks you can.
DPJHodges	725331139808862208	2016-04-27T14:29:54	JessEspinX   irony right?
DPJHodges	725329601099141120	2016-04-27T14:23:47	So now we know Labour doesn't have a zero tolerance approach to racism, what is it. 20% tolerance? 30%? 40% pushing it a bit?
DPJHodges	725329314254852096	2016-04-27T14:22:39	sarniejewell  Not from me he hasn't.
DPJHodges	725329250681774080	2016-04-27T14:22:23	Joe_Bradford_05    Yeah. Only last week I was looking through my articles from 2 years ago saying "throw the Jews out of Israel"...
DPJHodges	725328849446248448	2016-04-27T14:20:48	sarniejewell    I've criticised Boris. What she said was far,far worse.
DPJHodges	725327919799783424	2016-04-27T14:17:06	"We do not tolerate any forms of racism".  "I've just said something racist".  "Will you apologise?". "Yes". "No problem. On you go".

DPJHodges	721659569081069568	2016-04-17T11:20:23	SamBHodgson   So you don't think the US has a federal structure?
DPJHodges	721658751321796608	2016-04-17T11:17:08	SamBHodgson   But the idea the president of a federation wouldn't countenance federation is a good argument. Got it.

DPJHodges	721658215352659969	2016-04-17T11:15:00	jfbargh  I thought the Out campaigns argument was we are heading for a United States Of Europe.
DPJHodges	721657209986400256	2016-04-17T11:11:01	Hard_Specs   Out's argument is we're heading towards federation and Obama wouldn't countenance it. He is president of a federation.

DPJHodges	721656545646374912	2016-04-17T11:08:22	Hard_Specs   No, I accepted Obama is president of a  large federation.
DPJHodges	721655981378289665	2016-04-17T11:06:08	realhansard JohnRentoul   Yes, some. But a significant number will vote, and they will vote to Remain.
DPJHodges	721655690901786624	2016-04-17T11:04:59	Out are right that Obama wouldn't consider similar transfer of powers. He doesn't need to. It happened 190 years before he was born.

DPJHodges	721383031295057920	2016-04-16T17:01:31	alicharlo   Right. So the idea some members of the Jewish community will still vote Labour isn't really the issue here is it.
DPJHodges	721382391042940928	2016-04-16T16:58:59	paulsoviet JamesRose_X   No.
DPJHodges	721382294540414976	2016-04-16T16:58:36	alicharlo   So you don't think very significant numbers of people in the Jewish community will be refusing to vote Labour in May.
DPJHodges	721382033205956608	2016-04-16T16:57:34	cazziemacca ExSpAd    Yes, I can believe you do.

DPJHodges	721380112579567616	2016-04-16T16:49:56	JamesRose_X   His responded to Louise Ellman by saying "Zionists cant cope with anyone supporting rights for Palestine”.
DPJHodges	721379651113889792	2016-04-16T16:48:06	ExSpAd  And Corbyn then endorsed his views.
DPJHodges	721379570981675009	2016-04-16T16:47:46	alicharlo    And what about people who have Jewish kids. They have the spectacle of people saying "sorry, no a big enough problem".
DPJHodges	721379331730182144	2016-04-16T16:46:49	PhilMEdwards   So what is being done about Corbyn's endorsement of his brother's views on  "Zionists".
DPJHodges	721378770326790145	2016-04-16T16:44:36	zumbazumba5 robfordmancs  Precisely.

DPJHodges	721376806926958592	2016-04-16T16:36:47	PhilMEdwards   Jeremy Corbyn for a start.
DPJHodges	721376666103234560	2016-04-16T16:36:14	robfordmancs   No, I appreciate that. This stuff is genuinely complicated.
DPJHodges	721376517868167169	2016-04-16T16:35:39	SamJRushworth    OK, so what's currently being done about the Labour Leader's comments on Zionism.
DPJHodges	721376258509180929	2016-04-16T16:34:37	robfordmancs   Not if it gives anti-Semitism a boost, no.
DPJHodges	721376132810022912	2016-04-16T16:34:07	SamJRushworth  This isn't about whether Ed can win in Croydon Samuel.
DPJHodges	721375741942886400	2016-04-16T16:32:34	robfordmancs  No. I think Zac has to take a long hard look at himself over the campaign he's running mind. With Sadiq it's just his party.
DPJHodges	721375363935375361	2016-04-16T16:31:03	robfordmancs alicharlo carlgardner   Yes, but as I just said, that's in a political context. This is now a moral issue. For me, anyway.
DPJHodges	721375140836192262	2016-04-16T16:30:10	alicharlo robfordmancs carlgardner   That was a political choice. This is a moral one.
DPJHodges	721374999546851328	2016-04-16T16:29:37	PhilMEdwards   Well they're there. And being accommodated by the leadership. So now what.

DPJHodges	721374323982921728	2016-04-16T16:26:55	StanOfDarkness   They currently have control over the party. If they didn't this wouldn't be happening.
DPJHodges	721373932494929920	2016-04-16T16:25:22	gazzamc71   God knows.
DPJHodges	721373750067912704	2016-04-16T16:24:39	alicharlo robfordmancs carlgardner  That's why I said I'm not voting for either of the main parties.
DPJHodges	721373048696348672	2016-04-16T16:21:51	StanOfDarkness    No, but the political reality is a vote for them will reward those perpetuating the problem.
DPJHodges	721372613604483073	2016-04-16T16:20:08	PhilMEdwards   I was talking about anti-Semitism. You started talking about tax cuts.
DPJHodges	721372411212513280	2016-04-16T16:19:19	alicharlo robfordmancs stellacreasy  No, I will. Not sure who for. Neither of the two main parties.
DPJHodges	721372175446487040	2016-04-16T16:18:23	StanOfDarkness alicharlo robfordmancs stellacreasy   So to oppose the BNP I should join it.
DPJHodges	721371989290655745	2016-04-16T16:17:39	JoeSucksmith   Right on time Joe.
DPJHodges	721371404239839233	2016-04-16T16:15:19	stellacreasy   Of course.
DPJHodges	721371155106566145	2016-04-16T16:14:20	robfordmancs   I just don't think Labour supporters can continue to duck this issue any more.
DPJHodges	721370875786850304	2016-04-16T16:13:13	PhilMEdwards   So anti-Semitism is fine so long as it isn't accompanied by tax cuts for the rich.
DPJHodges	721370555434319872	2016-04-16T16:11:57	Ceejay62Cj    I'm not interested in people shouting "look over there!" any more. Labour needs to get its own house in order first.
DPJHodges	721369317074464768	2016-04-16T16:07:02	alicharlo robfordmancs stellacreasy   No, I'm afraid in my opinion you shouldn't.
DPJHodges	721369044620808192	2016-04-16T16:05:57	iainclark999   That's my point. It's not a shame. It's a disgrace.
DPJHodges	721368870448193536	2016-04-16T16:05:15	vellstells JewishLabour   Sorry. I respect your view. But there comes a point when people have to say "enough is enough".
DPJHodges	721368323506769920	2016-04-16T16:03:05	robfordmancs  Yes. But Labour's anti-Semitism has ceased to be a grey area.
DPJHodges	721368165368860672	2016-04-16T16:02:27	robfordmancs    But when he became leader he directly challenged racism. That is the opposite of what is currently happening in Labour.
DPJHodges	721367888951701504	2016-04-16T16:01:21	SamJRushworth   And there we go. You can't do it, can you. You just can't help yourself. A Labour candidate.
DPJHodges	721367491545591808	2016-04-16T15:59:47	robfordmancs SamJRushworth   Yes. Because as was demonstrated, he was committed to fighting racism.
DPJHodges	721367347836153856	2016-04-16T15:59:12	SamJRushworth   Labour's anti-Semitism is being tolerated from the top to the bottom of the party.
DPJHodges	721366544652050433	2016-04-16T15:56:01	robfordmancs LBJ may have been racist, (it's debated). But he was prepared to direct challenge racism. Unlike current Labour leadership.
DPJHodges	721365625898184705	2016-04-16T15:52:22	SamJRushworth  Right. So you're literally saying "our anti-Semitism doesn't make us perfect, but ignore it and vote for us anyway".
DPJHodges	721365036019662848	2016-04-16T15:50:01	And it shouldn't just be left to Jewish Labour supporters to say "sorry, I can't put up with this any more".
DPJHodges	721364705244266496	2016-04-16T15:48:42	The_real_OX   Did you visit the church?
DPJHodges	721363642772492288	2016-04-16T15:44:29	It's no longer simply acceptable to say "yes, Labour's got a serious racism problem. Here Labour, have my vote".
DPJHodges	721363329831317504	2016-04-16T15:43:14	PlatitudePlyt  Partly because of this.
DPJHodges	721363225741299714	2016-04-16T15:42:49	Yes, there are a lot of good people fighting this stuff. But reality is, until it's sorted it's morally indefensible to vote Labour.
DPJHodges	721361951654297600	2016-04-16T15:37:46	Way Corbynites are acting as willing human shields for Labour anti-Semitism has actually become quite disgusting now.

DPJHodges	719284655271317504	2016-04-10T22:03:20	mikeysmith  Nope. The system explicitly says "if you spend on yourself, fine. If you want to pass on to anyone else, we want our share".

DPJHodges	719282326287556608	2016-04-10T21:54:04	mikeysmith    Council tax is, (sensibly), to provide local accountability to services.
DPJHodges	719282018278891520	2016-04-10T21:52:51	SachieAlgernon  And regressive.
DPJHodges	719281915090624514	2016-04-10T21:52:26	MrBLawton  Because what's the purpose of a tax system that encourages people to spend on themselves, rather than provide for their kids.
DPJHodges	719280905362227200	2016-04-10T21:48:26	marcusaroberts   I thought it was very good. Especially the first half.
DPJHodges	719280502541299712	2016-04-10T21:46:50	My own view is you should pay tax once. Raise Income Tax if you're that concerned, and abolish Inheritance Tax and VAT.
DPJHodges	719278497282265088	2016-04-10T21:38:51	By the way, PCollinsTimes  is wrong about inheritance tax. But he's not jumping on any bandwagons. He's always held this view.

DPJHodges	718709206724014081	2016-04-09T07:56:42	mikeysmith AbiWilks   Right. And did he then pay tax on those profits?

DPJHodges	718196370771943425	2016-04-07T21:58:52	oh my goodness THIS. A THOUSAND TIMES THIS 
DPJHodges	718196338832379905	2016-04-07T21:58:45	c_dunleavy   Fine. So what's Cameron done that isn't OK.
DPJHodges	718194987050078209	2016-04-07T21:53:22	JohnDowson3   Maybe. But David Cameron did.
DPJHodges	718194438074417157	2016-04-07T21:51:12	c_dunleavy   Well, someone's certainly missing the point here Cameron...
DPJHodges	718193774443282432	2016-04-07T21:48:33	mattzarb   Yes. So the money was paid in dividends. And the tax was paid on that.
DPJHodges	718192828690644993	2016-04-07T21:44:48	BIRING1701 AsaWinstanley   Yeah, thanks, but I've had my fill of you anti-Semitism apologists for one day.

DPJHodges	718189414451712000	2016-04-07T21:31:14	weebeysfish   Yes. I think there may also have been something about trying to  keep his father out of it.
DPJHodges	718188638216056832	2016-04-07T21:28:09	richie26188  Oh. OK, thanks.
DPJHodges	718187476926533632	2016-04-07T21:23:32	richie26188   Would I. On what grounds.
DPJHodges	718187382219137025	2016-04-07T21:23:09	john_booma   Calm down. He'll be gone in a few years anyway. Don't be so emotionally invested.
DPJHodges	718186928823263232	2016-04-07T21:21:21	PeterGarbutt TweetyBirdStars  Because the fund was investing in the dollar area.

DPJHodges	718185399160582145	2016-04-07T21:15:17	ItsLloydM8 john_booma   Tax avoidance.
DPJHodges	718185248387919873	2016-04-07T21:14:41	mattzarb  It wasn't. As this makes clear.  
DPJHodges	718184502233841664	2016-04-07T21:11:43	mattzarb   But the money that would have been paid in tax was instead paid in dividends. Which was then paid in tax.
DPJHodges	718183995629023232	2016-04-07T21:09:42	mattzarb   So what is his crime.
DPJHodges	718181548252639232	2016-04-07T20:59:58	john_booma   You're really desperate for people to pretend Cameron did something wrong, aren't you...
DPJHodges	718180183853907970	2016-04-07T20:54:33	TweetyBirdStars PeterGarbutt      All explained here. 
DPJHodges	718179798279921665	2016-04-07T20:53:01	SallyForWestway cazziemacca robfordmancs   Yes. I can Google "desperate back pedalling" as well.
DPJHodges	718177707234881537	2016-04-07T20:44:43	PeterGarbutt   No. I'm saying the fund was not a tax avoidance vehicle.
DPJHodges	718177528117141506	2016-04-07T20:44:00	SallyForWestway cazziemacca robfordmancs  Right. So you're not able to substantiate your allegation. Glad we got that sorted.
DPJHodges	718177127963705344	2016-04-07T20:42:25	PeterGarbutt  Either.
DPJHodges	718176991229448192	2016-04-07T20:41:52	SallyForWestway cazziemacca robfordmancs   And what technique is that. Specifically.

DPJHodges	718172397732499458	2016-04-07T20:23:37	Oh, and for those who are asking, yes I do think Labour anti-Semitism is more important than David Cameron's tax affairs.
DPJHodges	718171342588284930	2016-04-07T20:19:25	siZondi RyanCoetzee   Fine. But he didn't.
DPJHodges	718171124799049728	2016-04-07T20:18:33	JohnDowson3   Legally. Morally. It wasn't a tax avoidance vehicle.

DPJHodges	718170509452656641	2016-04-07T20:16:07	obscuredview  Yes. I suspect that had an impact. But it's a ludicrous own goal.

DPJHodges	718168136571305985	2016-04-07T20:06:41	seamushassonMS   The way it's been managed is disastrous in PR terms.
DPJHodges	718167428019187712	2016-04-07T20:03:52	Actually, it now appears that not only has David Cameron not done anything wrong, neither did his father.

DPJHodges	718146540557176832	2016-04-07T18:40:52	For people tweeting me. Panama Papers are supposed to be about tax avoidance/evasion. Cameron didn't avoid/evade any tax.
DPJHodges	718145833313693696	2016-04-07T18:38:03	NotACatOK  No because he didn't avoid paying tax.

DPJHodges	718143231599443968	2016-04-07T18:27:43	Shirker1982 investor_bod KayBurley   Right. So he was aware he would be held to account.

DPJHodges	712025813433118722	2016-03-21T21:19:17	Lot of people focusing on Jeremy Corbyn's performance. Should also be pointed out John McDonnell was almost as bad.
DPJHodges	712017266137808896	2016-03-21T20:45:19	Congrats to SophyRidgeSky 
DPJHodges	712024809564151808	2016-03-21T21:15:18	AndKiely MichaelPDeacon  And what about the Guardian. Which has an almost identical piece.
DPJHodges	712024093537771520	2016-03-21T21:12:27	I sense a theme developing from the sketch-writers this evening...

DPJHodges	711999262612131840	2016-03-21T19:33:47	amanojyaku23   Badly. But he'd been badly damaged before.
DPJHodges	711977864674021377	2016-03-21T18:08:45	It's been an amazing afternoon for less-known talent in the Commons. davidgauke scrabbmp and Labour's OwenSmith_MP all superb
DPJHodges	711975385009881089	2016-03-21T17:58:54	patriot_searso  Ta. And you.
DPJHodges	711975234354675712	2016-03-21T17:58:18	patriot_searso  Nope. All the best.
DPJHodges	711972601745248256	2016-03-21T17:47:50	Stephen Crabb fighting back well. Worth keeping an eye on these two guys.

DPJHodges	711965996295327744	2016-03-21T17:21:35	Earlier, John McDonnell had found himself one-on-one against David Gauke...   
DPJHodges	711963818792980480	2016-03-21T17:12:56	Shadow minister on Corbyn's statement: "Utterly pitiful and denies the country the opposition it deserves." Labour MPs truly in despair.
DPJHodges	711962126626254849	2016-03-21T17:06:13	StigAbell  Or that Downing Street have been briefing since 9.00 this morning Cameron would be using the statement to launch a fightback.
DPJHodges	711961327078674433	2016-03-21T17:03:02	iainclark999  No.
DPJHodges	711960841579536384	2016-03-21T17:01:06	Jeremy Corbyn. The House of Commons. 4.30.   
DPJHodges	711957750356557825	2016-03-21T16:48:49	ic56man  You're right. He was a tiger...
DPJHodges	711955045923864577	2016-03-21T16:38:05	Does Jeremy Corbyn actually know Iain Duncan Smith has resigned? Did no one in his prep team think to check?
DPJHodges	711955500276039680	2016-03-21T16:39:53	If Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell can't put the government on the ropes after the events of the past 72 hours, when will they.
DPJHodges	711954221847937024	2016-03-21T16:34:48	That was arguably Corbyn's worst yet given how good it could have been. What could Cooper, Eagle, Benn et al have done with this chance?
DPJHodges	711954146702839809	2016-03-21T16:34:30	I think that statement from Corbyn has made a summer leadership challenge against him inevitable.
DPJHodges	711953700126912512	2016-03-21T16:32:44	We're currently witnessing Corbyn's Westland moment.
DPJHodges	711953374233624576	2016-03-21T16:31:26	This is a terrible response from Corbyn, delivered when government is in complete mess.
DPJHodges	711953198001553409	2016-03-21T16:30:44	Jeremy Corbyn currently showing the political tenacity of a haddock.
DPJHodges	711949600802906112	2016-03-21T16:16:26	Always seems a great ruse to drag the minister to the chamber when the government's in trouble. Always the same result. MPs rally round.
DPJHodges	711947650900348928	2016-03-21T16:08:41	steve_hawkes DPJHodges and when not duffing up Osborne they also enjoy a cheeky Nandos: 
DPJHodges	711946678895579136	2016-03-21T16:04:50	MrHarryCole  Indeed.
DPJHodges	711946505284939779	2016-03-21T16:04:08	David Gauke has become the Willy Caballero of British politics.
DPJHodges	711891529489633280	2016-03-21T12:25:41	misslucyp  Fine. But you'll be aware of that sort of response, and you'll beware of what lies behind it.
DPJHodges	711890540569227265	2016-03-21T12:21:45	misslucyp  Because it's the same as when people respond to racism against a minority group by saying "what about anti-white racism".
DPJHodges	711889618300485633	2016-03-21T12:18:05	misslucyp   He was asked about anti-Semitism. He moved the conversation onto Islamophobia. You know why. I know why.
DPJHodges	711889298803564548	2016-03-21T12:16:49	foraneasylife  No need. If we vote Out Cameron goes. Everyone knows that.
DPJHodges	711888844040347649	2016-03-21T12:15:01	misslucyp beatonthedonis  Precisely. Can never bring himself to condemn anti-Semitism alone.
DPJHodges	711888406532460544	2016-03-21T12:13:17	beatonthedonis   No, he was saying "I'm not just going to condemn anti-Semitism because my constituency won't like it".
DPJHodges	711887929027731456	2016-03-21T12:11:23	misslucyp beatonthedonis   No, and my response to islamophobia isn't "don't forget about anti-Semitism".
DPJHodges	711887316701339648	2016-03-21T12:08:57	One other interesting thing about briefing is it's clear Eurosceptics don't think they'll win the referendum, and are planning accordingly.
DPJHodges	711886780237279232	2016-03-21T12:06:49	beatonthedonis  He was being asked specifically about anti-Semitism.
DPJHodges	711886136881369088	2016-03-21T12:04:15	melindiscott  Well, quite.
DPJHodges	711886069856399360	2016-03-21T12:03:59	_IanMoss   Yes. But bulk of Labour MPs were behind those moves by then. Not the case with the Tories.
DPJHodges	711885567261282305	2016-03-21T12:02:00	LostTransport  If EU referendum is won, don't see how rebels get anywhere near numbers to fatally wound Cameron.
DPJHodges	711885290630205440	2016-03-21T12:00:54	Of course, given majority those rebels could make life hell for Cam. But not sure bulk of Tory MPs would accept constant guerrilla warfare.
DPJHodges	711884307795677185	2016-03-21T11:56:59	beatonthedonis  Because he mentioned it.
DPJHodges	711883616360468480	2016-03-21T11:54:14	TomChivers   Well, I think he rather not have it. But if they forced it, he'd welcome opportunity to face them down.
DPJHodges	711883374328193024	2016-03-21T11:53:17	LostTransport  He wouldn't. He'd say "fine. Let's see if I've got the confidence of the parliamentary party or not".
DPJHodges	711883126461636609	2016-03-21T11:52:18	PlatoSays  It is the point. Cameron would fight a challenge, and win it.
DPJHodges	711882946219798528	2016-03-21T11:51:35	PunkSunflower  Yes. But they need to get over 160 Tory MPs to vote against him for that to happen.
DPJHodges	711882814908661760	2016-03-21T11:51:03	TomChivers  Correct. Don't see any way "rebels" get anywhere near number they need to depose him.
DPJHodges	711882477095223296	2016-03-21T11:49:43	...that then requires major of Tory MPs to vote against Cameron, (over 160). If they don'y get that, can't be new challenge for 12 months.
DPJHodges	711882200959098881	2016-03-21T11:48:37	Re-Cameron leadership hysteria. Not sure people understand the rules. 50 names doesn't trigger contest. It triggers no-confidence vote...
DPJHodges	711877353039908864	2016-03-21T11:29:21	I wish Ed Miliband was Prime Minister.
DPJHodges	711874971946110976	2016-03-21T11:19:53	TomChivers  I bought him dinner once...  
DPJHodges	711874669071241217	2016-03-21T11:18:41	Clip of Corbyn illustrates problem. Can't ever just condemn anti-Semitism. Always has to conflate with Islamophobia. 
DPJHodges	711873753525960705	2016-03-21T11:15:03	TomChivers   Or loves journalists who work on Sunday newspapers...
DPJHodges	711866037462048768	2016-03-21T10:44:23	paulwaugh   Given Labour won the subsequent election with a majority of 179 I think we can safely park that historic analogy.
DPJHodges	711839161125355520	2016-03-21T08:57:36	AnnaYearley StewartWood   ...that is deeply disconcerting...
DPJHodges	711835364776910848	2016-03-21T08:42:30	That should do it 
DPJHodges	711830241619136512	2016-03-21T08:22:09	DPJHodges 
DPJHodges	711829989587591168	2016-03-21T08:21:09	Does anyone seriously beleive the attacks on Cameron and Osborne are because the Tory right believes they are insufficiently progressive.
DPJHodges	711824650930524160	2016-03-21T07:59:56	1st Round: Khan 42%, Goldsmith 39%, Pidgeon 6%, Berry 6%, Whittle 5%, Galliway1%.
DPJHodges	711822634732953600	2016-03-21T07:51:55	Tory candidate Zac Goldsmith is closing the gap on his Labour rival in the contest to be London mayor, according to a new opinion poll.
DPJHodges	711682243580862465	2016-03-20T22:34:03	Can someone explain. Does a true Tory believe in cutting welfare and protecting pensions. Or protecting welfare and cutting pensions.
DPJHodges	711665375822401536	2016-03-20T21:27:02	LDNCalling  ...can you blame him...
DPJHodges	711658845240737792	2016-03-20T21:01:05	streetswept  Is that what your banker dad told you.
DPJHodges	711653039183163392	2016-03-20T20:38:01	stephenkb   But as I say, GWB implementation was a disaster.
DPJHodges	711651696838053888	2016-03-20T20:32:41	stephenkb IainDale  But I thought your criticism of IDS was around implementation?
DPJHodges	711649274552053761	2016-03-20T20:23:03	stephenkb IainDale   No Child Left Behind was a disaster wasn't it?
DPJHodges	711497195669823489	2016-03-20T10:18:45	donpaskini  Nope.
DPJHodges	711497091021987840	2016-03-20T10:18:20	mr_ceebs  No. They've been accused of being in same place as IDS.
DPJHodges	711495977849516032	2016-03-20T10:13:54	Problem for Labour moderates. Anyone who tries to suggest shift in Labour's stance of welfare will be accused of being to right of IDS.
DPJHodges	711495712811442176	2016-03-20T10:12:51	donpaskini   But they won't. Corbyn will use this as excuse to attack any idea of welfare reform, and moderates will have to back off.
DPJHodges	711495279544037376	2016-03-20T10:11:08	Cusstard RodBelgrave ProwlerHans  So why did he resign.
DPJHodges	711494723014414336	2016-03-20T10:08:55	donpaskini  Maybe. But idea Cameron/Osborne only reaching out to core vore with this policy is wrong.
DPJHodges	711494497209810944	2016-03-20T10:08:01	SerenaCowdy   Because first part was on reasons for resignation, and as we saw, he hasn't really got one.
DPJHodges	711493384007983104	2016-03-20T10:03:36	Good think about that interview from IDS perspective though is whole country finally got to see his genuine passion for social justice.
DPJHodges	711492932159860736	2016-03-20T10:01:48	PL2Abe  No. Not them.
DPJHodges	711492345523539968	2016-03-20T09:59:28	Speak to any Labour MP and they'll tell you welfare reform is one of the areas where Tory policy aligns with views of Labour voters.
DPJHodges	711491445702660096	2016-03-20T09:55:54	Passionate ending from IDS. But he didn't give convincing explanation for the reason for his resignation.
DPJHodges	711490838552027136	2016-03-20T09:53:29	Sorry, the idea Cameron and Osborne have pursuing some sort of Tory core vote strategy is ludicrous.
DPJHodges	711490159246753794	2016-03-20T09:50:47	Don't think IDS is going to be able to argue with credibility the welfare cap was forced onto him by the Treasury.
DPJHodges	711487184365338624	2016-03-20T09:38:58	IDS not doing convincing job on explaining PIP policy difference.

DPJHodges	711483444296077312	2016-03-20T09:24:06	The most staggering thing about the IDS resignation is it has momentarily made David Laws politically relevant again.
DPJHodges	711479729690386433	2016-03-20T09:09:20	melindiscott  Apologies. .

DPJHodges	710989258773889024	2016-03-19T00:40:23	gabyhinsliff iainmartin1  Thanks!
DPJHodges	710989179187032064	2016-03-19T00:40:04	iainmartin1 gabyhinsliff  Come on. IDS letter wasn't about Cameron pulling policy he, (IDS), had been batting for.
DPJHodges	710988883077496832	2016-03-19T00:38:53	gabyhinsliff iainmartin1  But IDS didn't say he'd resigned because the policy he supported had been reversed.
DPJHodges	710988625303969797	2016-03-19T00:37:52	iainmartin1 gabyhinsliff  Correct. The "welfare cuts for tax cuts" narrative is just wrong. But IDS letter plays into that.
DPJHodges	710988239671320576	2016-03-19T00:36:20	iainmartin1 gabyhinsliff   Yes. But IDS supported the "cuts".
DPJHodges	710988088575717377	2016-03-19T00:35:44	iainmartin1 gabyhinsliff   Yes. But Gabby's point was this was an example of MPs being forced to back bad policy. IDS backed the policy.
DPJHodges	710987894782038016	2016-03-19T00:34:58	iainmartin1 gabyhinsliff   Simple fact is it was IDS own policy. He may not have liked the budget presentation. But he backed the "cuts".
DPJHodges	710987565965381635	2016-03-19T00:33:39	gabyhinsliff iainmartin1  Whether it was included in the budget doesn't alter the fact IDS supported the policy he's just resigned over.
DPJHodges	710987097377804288	2016-03-19T00:31:48	iainmartin1 gabyhinsliff   Right. But he supported the PIP cuts.
DPJHodges	710986383096213505	2016-03-19T00:28:57	gabyhinsliff   Take the heat for what? His own policy?
DPJHodges	710985955411361792	2016-03-19T00:27:15	LeysKarl  So working class people who back welfare reforms are c***s.

DPJHodges	710978651156815876	2016-03-18T23:58:14	The pressure for welfare reform comes from working class voters, but no-one on the liberal Left can stomach that fact.

DPJHodges	710975055484854272	2016-03-18T23:43:57	_IanMoss ianmulheirn adrianmcmenamin  Come off it. Welfare was a basket case under Labour.
DPJHodges	710974700235657217	2016-03-18T23:42:32	BergerBrakes kindofwater  That's what I was saying. Whatever your perspective, there is an issue with welfare that needs to be addressed.
DPJHodges	710974286979338240	2016-03-18T23:40:53	BergerBrakes kindofwater  No. Just pointing out welfare dependency is now an issue. Do you agree or disagree.

DPJHodges	710973045331136516	2016-03-18T23:35:57	BergerBrakes kindofwater  Correct. So what are people in those areas currently living off.
DPJHodges	710972581390786561	2016-03-18T23:34:07	BergerBrakes kindofwater   So what's happened in those areas. Are people living on welfare or sustainable employment.

DPJHodges	710967003469783040	2016-03-18T23:11:57	kindofwater No. Because you don't want - or have to - engage in the realities of the welfare issue. But serious people do.
DPJHodges	710966162981576704	2016-03-18T23:08:37	kindofwater   Doesn't Labour now accept the principle of a benefits cap?
DPJHodges	710965849398624257	2016-03-18T23:07:22	Eclectic_Blue  Hence the "whatever the ins and outs of his resignation" bit.

DPJHodges	703274483923161088	2016-02-26T17:44:37	rrwholloway  You don't think it's significant the company you chose to underline case for leaving the EU wants Britain to remain in the EU.
DPJHodges	703269879118479361	2016-02-26T17:26:19	rrwholloway So having cited BMW as an example you're now saying we should ignore BMW.
DPJHodges	703268874481999872	2016-02-26T17:22:20	rrwholloway     Now, why do they say that.
DPJHodges	703267568795123713	2016-02-26T17:17:09	colinwforster   If the PM was in one you'd have a point.
DPJHodges	703266691753644036	2016-02-26T17:13:40	rrwholloway   So why do we sign trade deals. And who do we sign them with.
DPJHodges	703266531808055297	2016-02-26T17:13:01	LNACurrie rrwholloway   I see. So our economic model is post-Soviet USSR.
DPJHodges	703266113099010050	2016-02-26T17:11:22	rrwholloway   "it would be very mundane". Seriously.

DPJHodges	703265309680136192	2016-02-26T17:08:10	TakisOxRoad  True. I could still be persuaded. And thanks.
DPJHodges	703265126380605440	2016-02-26T17:07:26	rrwholloway   Correct. How long does it take to negotiate your average trade deal. And how many would be required.
DPJHodges	703263990705745921	2016-02-26T17:02:56	rrwholloway   Are they also saying we wouldn't need a new trade agreement.
DPJHodges	703263622340988928	2016-02-26T17:01:28	unscarred_j   The former.

DPJHodges	702610541752295425	2016-02-24T21:46:21	JamieBurton29   Racial aggravation/motivation. Doesn't matter. Race was a key factor.
DPJHodges	702608750318919684	2016-02-24T21:39:14	HDBrighton  Correct. But in this instance abuse perpetrated on an almost industrial scale, 1,400 victims. And no action because of race.
DPJHodges	702605606671224832	2016-02-24T21:26:45	HDBrighton  Race was reason abuse happened and was allowed to continue. If we don't face up to that it will happen again.

DPJHodges	701527090152271877	2016-02-21T22:01:06	Boris is backing a No vote but not necessarily Brexit. Last February he told me he wanted to lead the renegotiation. He still does.

DPJHodges	701463213746102276	2016-02-21T17:47:17	Boris informed David Cameron of his plan to back Brexit in an email on Saturday morning. There was no reply.

DPJHodges	701323782120722433	2016-02-21T08:33:14	RodBelgrave  Corbyn's not objecting to child benefit payments brake. He's objecting to brake on all migrant benefits.

DPJHodges	701322188092284928	2016-02-21T08:26:54	If Corbyn sticks to benefits brake line, Labour official policy will be it wants migrants to be able to come to UK to claim benefits.

DPJHodges	699989359999770625	2016-02-17T16:10:43	NUFC_OurClub  It isn't small. That's the point. It's part of the  culture of Labour and the wider Left now.

DPJHodges	699987678989848576	2016-02-17T16:04:02	NUFC_OurClub  Right. So you admit that at the moment the Labour party is dangerously racist.
DPJHodges	699987443299328002	2016-02-17T16:03:06	make_trouble hx_06  It's a disgrace. And it's been tolerated on the Left for too long.
DPJHodges	699987084732428292	2016-02-17T16:01:40	NUFC_OurClub  Ah. So it's not racism. It's an "anti-semitic strand". That's a relief.
DPJHodges	699986842721107968	2016-02-17T16:00:43	NUFC_OurClub   Like I say, Labour's racism starts at the top, and works its way down from there.

DPJHodges	699729792887885824	2016-02-16T22:59:17	Said it before. "I'm not a racist, I'm an anti-Zionist" has become the Left's "I can't be racist against Muslims, Muslims aren't a race".

DPJHodges	693020660004712448	2016-01-29T10:39:35	Ryan__Blake   I'll ask again. Does removing of statues represent a dangerous air-brushing of history, or doesn't it.
DPJHodges	693020153404100610	2016-01-29T10:37:34	colinwforster  Dod we disprove of the destruction of the statues of Saddam?

DPJHodges	693019833705852928	2016-01-29T10:36:18	stephen_wigmore  Then like I say, fine. But let's not act shocked when some people say "sorry, I don't really want to venerate that guy".
DPJHodges	693019517153341442	2016-01-29T10:35:03	mickeyhynes   Right. So removing statues is not - of itself -represent  a dangerous air-brushing of history.
DPJHodges	693019221882753024	2016-01-29T10:33:52	.Ryan__Blake  So if there isn't a statue to something it didn't happen.
DPJHodges	693019078521425921	2016-01-29T10:33:18	SusanMunro13  Perfect.
DPJHodges	693018901936902144	2016-01-29T10:32:36	Ryan__Blake  That's not the point. Does removing of statues represent a dangerous air-brushing of history, or doesn't it.
DPJHodges	693018603193552897	2016-01-29T10:31:25	colinwforster   Shall we ask the Russians to put back their statues of Stalin and the German's their symbols of Nazism.
DPJHodges	693018394640175104	2016-01-29T10:30:35	AngryBulldog mnitchsmith  What mob has tons down the statue of Cecil Rhodes.
DPJHodges	693018223373987840	2016-01-29T10:29:54	chithecynic   No, I'm asking is it right that the removal of statues represents an assault on free thought/speech.
DPJHodges	693018034982752258	2016-01-29T10:29:09	MEDGA2504  So what's the answer then.
DPJHodges	693017932989726720	2016-01-29T10:28:45	iancmichie  I'll ask again. Should the statues of Stalin and Hitler/Nazism have been removed.
DPJHodges	693017352074567680	2016-01-29T10:26:27	DPJHodges liberal students at it again 
DPJHodges	693017059412840449	2016-01-29T10:25:17	DavidWPlatt1  Rhodes imposed himself on Africa didn't he?
DPJHodges	693016701533822976	2016-01-29T10:23:51	iancmichie  So if it's fatuous what's the answer. Should those statues still be up or not.
DPJHodges	693016563167924225	2016-01-29T10:23:18	@_Genius_Loci   You''re right. Those blinkered black people. Kicking up about those white supremacists.
DPJHodges	693016204546609152	2016-01-29T10:21:53	NotSoRedEd   That's not the argument. Does removing statues represent a dangerous assault to our freedom.
DPJHodges	693015961314684928	2016-01-29T10:20:55	timjn1   Fine. But why do we need a statue of the guy?
DPJHodges	693015813058617344	2016-01-29T10:20:20	NotSoRedEd  So the Stalin statues should still be up. And those of Hitler.
DPJHodges	693015668598444032	2016-01-29T10:19:45	mnitchsmith  Nothing to do with Godwin's law. Is removing statues a dangerous assault on our freedom, or isn't it.
DPJHodges	693015138635374592	2016-01-29T10:17:39	DenisMacShane DPJHodges Statue isn't the problem. It's the unthinking glorification of the "hero" that is. Critical perspective needed.
DPJHodges	693015022470066177	2016-01-29T10:17:11	And if removing statues is an affront to freedom, presumably the statues of Stalin and Lenin should still be up, and those of Hitler.
DPJHodges	693014628956291074	2016-01-29T10:15:37	billy_bagman  Do you thin the Russians should have left the statues of Stalin and Lenin up. What about the statues of Hitler in Germany.
DPJHodges	693014338592968704	2016-01-29T10:14:28	UndercoverMutha  Correct. No one's saying pretend he'd didn't exist. They're just saying let's stop venerating him.
DPJHodges	693014074964197377	2016-01-29T10:13:25	clevelandminer  Depends on whether people want them taken down.
DPJHodges	693013732700614657	2016-01-29T10:12:04	RyanCoetzee ...talking black bin-liners here. The guy was a thoroughly racist white supremacist.
DPJHodges	693013597455282177	2016-01-29T10:11:31	RyanCoetzee   I think most of the horror has been towards the idea of removing the statue. May be wrong, may be right. But we're not...
DPJHodges	693013200749641728	2016-01-29T10:09:57	Also, can we get away from the ludicrous argument that if there isn't a bloody great statue of someone they've been removed from history.
DPJHodges	693012971304456192	2016-01-29T10:09:02	RyanCoetzee  Correct. Saying "this is just another example of PC culture gone mad" isn't good enough.
DPJHodges	693012747144007681	2016-01-29T10:08:09	UndercoverMutha   You might be right. But it's time people stopped belittling people who say "hang on, this guy was a white supremacist".
DPJHodges	693011656650145792	2016-01-29T10:03:49	the_socrates  Not sure.  What I do know is if black people say, "we think this is a bit sus", we shouldn't feign outrage at it.
DPJHodges	693010823426482176	2016-01-29T10:00:30	Cecil Rhodes was a white supremacist. Oxford wants its statue, fine. But is it really surprising black students say "er..hang on a second".
