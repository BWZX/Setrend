nhannahjones	685632703362940931	2016-01-09T01:22:29	20.) It's also remarkable to read abt Ida B. Wells exposure of extrajudicial killings of blk men as our nation today struggles with the same
nhannahjones	685632307902988288	2016-01-09T01:20:55	19.) Ida B. Wells also exposed what we now know to be one of the oldest ploys in the book: Blaming black men to cover up one's own crimes.
nhannahjones	685631383247650816	2016-01-09T01:17:14	@Stephan873 It was known to happen. But after slavery, lynching became almost completely racialized.
nhannahjones	685630381320736769	2016-01-09T01:13:15	18.) Ida B. Wells was also known to keep a gun, and when white folks chased her son's home, they knew to stop at her threshold.
nhannahjones	685630202312060928	2016-01-09T01:12:33	17.) Ida B. Wells said, "If we forget our dead and the injustice to their families nobody will remember them for us."
nhannahjones	685629926763048960	2016-01-09T01:11:27	16. Ida B. Wells exposed lynchings as a means to ruin black folks economically and prevent them from exercising political power.
nhannahjones	685629651243368448	2016-01-09T01:10:21	15.) Ida B. Wells investigated these lynchings, exposing them for what they were: terrorism designed to keep blk people in fear...
nhannahjones	685629386771578880	2016-01-09T01:09:18	14.) And the black man and wife forced to hold out their hands so each finger could be cut off, then had corkscrew bore into their skin.
nhannahjones	685628799011172352	2016-01-09T01:06:58	13.) Sam Hose's knuckles, bits of his liver, were sold as souvenirs. A slice of his hear delivered to Georgia's governor.
nhannahjones	685628442692435969	2016-01-09T01:05:33	12.) Or Sam Hose in ATL, who was strung up, his ear cut off, fingers cut off, his face skinned, his penis slice off, and burned alive.
nhannahjones	685627355444961280	2016-01-09T01:01:14	11.) Then burned him alive, when he escaped the fire, threw him back in. They sold train ticket to the lynching,recorded his screams to sell
nhannahjones	685627104478781441	2016-01-09T01:00:14	10.) Like Paris, TX, where they tortured Henry Smith with hot brands for 50 mins, burned his eyes out, thrust hot pokers dwn his throat.
nhannahjones	685626763100176385	2016-01-09T00:58:53	9.) The lynchings that Ida B. Wells documented and investigated are seared in my mind.
nhannahjones	685625371472052224	2016-01-09T00:53:21	8.) But also, I've realized Giddings bio is not just a book about Ida B. Wells, but about American terror. Period.
nhannahjones	685625215741747200	2016-01-09T00:52:44	7.) Ida B. Wells did this despite men, often of her own race (like DuBois), who tried to demean her, minimize her, take credit for her work.
nhannahjones	685624962061828098	2016-01-09T00:51:43	6.) When Ida B. Wells had her children, she took them on the road with them if necessary, even while nursing.
nhannahjones	685624797854863360	2016-01-09T00:51:04	5.) Ida B. Wells-BARNETT married the most feminist of men, one who respected her work, and knew she was the best at what she did.
nhannahjones	685624553972830208	2016-01-09T00:50:06	4.) Ida B. Wells forcibly integrated a women's suffrage march when its white leaders tried to make her march with the black contingent.
nhannahjones	685624198425874432	2016-01-09T00:48:41	3.) She called out foes and allies alike, especially when it came to their classism abt poor blk folks, and when it came 2 hypocrisy on race
nhannahjones	685623847379406849	2016-01-09T00:47:18	2.) She was the bossest of  journos. OG data reporter. Investigated the lies of lynching that mainstream media embraced. Pen was scathing.
nhannahjones	685623610770386944	2016-01-09T00:46:21	1.) Ida B. Wells was the bossest of chicks. Married in her 30s cuz she was too busy working. Hyphenated her name. Named her girl Ida Jr. (!)
nhannahjones	685623123358646272	2016-01-09T00:44:25	So, I am re-reading the Paula Giddings biography on Ida B. Wells. And this time around, maybe due to where I am in my life, it's revelatory.
