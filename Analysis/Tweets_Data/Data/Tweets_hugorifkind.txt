hugorifkind	725292088594669568	2016-04-27T11:54:43	Smyth_Chris TomChivers VictoriaPeckham whippletom tracey_thorn I suspect he must, but just opts not to engage with it.
hugorifkind	725291874345431040	2016-04-27T11:53:52	Kumaranism But I'm afraid I don't think that very likely. And a post-Brexit tory govt would ultimately be more, not less, hostile.
hugorifkind	725291593918496768	2016-04-27T11:52:45	Kumaranism Not much, I'm afraid. Your best hope at this stage is that govt falls for unrelated reasons (Brexit?) and next one backs away.

hugorifkind	725219999477043200	2016-04-27T07:08:16	Today's Times front page, 2nd edition: 
hugorifkind	725222979387441152	2016-04-27T07:20:06	willshome CallenFamily Well, that's not my fault.
hugorifkind	725222821819985920	2016-04-27T07:19:29	willshome CallenFamily I don't. Except for when I think they betray bigoted views about people like me and my extended family.
hugorifkind	725222511865122816	2016-04-27T07:18:15	willshome CallenFamily Yes, but it would be like me saying you aren't really called "Will". With you insisting you are.
hugorifkind	725222227453591552	2016-04-27T07:17:07	willshome CallenFamily Woah there. My ethno-religous identity doesn't make me Israeli.
hugorifkind	725222074223054848	2016-04-27T07:16:31	willshome CallenFamily Well, sure, but only because they'd consider Modern Orthodox unorthodox, iyswim. But that's still the name.
hugorifkind	725221198716649472	2016-04-27T07:13:02	willshome CallenFamily Not unless you mean ethno-religious identity. Which is strong, but I think mainly because others throw it at me.
hugorifkind	725220932659335169	2016-04-27T07:11:58	willshome CallenFamily No, you're not getting this. It's like "Methodist" or "Anglican". Not like "religious" or "less religious".
hugorifkind	725220459910971392	2016-04-27T07:10:06	willshome CallenFamily yep
hugorifkind	725220280646402048	2016-04-27T07:09:23	willshome CallenFamily Well, no. I married out. Which is a big reason why I have nothing to do with religion now. But it wasn't a surprise
hugorifkind	725219951368396801	2016-04-27T07:08:04	willshome CallenFamily Orthodox in UK is otherwise known as Modern Orthodox. These terms are about doctrine, not observance.
hugorifkind	725219708128124929	2016-04-27T07:07:07	willshome CallenFamily No. You're technically wrong. "Orthodox" is a branch, not an adjective. Ultra-Orthodox means Haredi, Hassidim, etc.
hugorifkind	725219428212834304	2016-04-27T07:06:00	willshome CallenFamily They're a loony cult. Ultra-Orthodox judaism has many loony cults. This one is anti-Zionist.
hugorifkind	725219126290042880	2016-04-27T07:04:48	willshome CallenFamily I have. And I'd do so more if Israel was my priority. It isn't. European antisemitism is, because I'm from here.
hugorifkind	725218532963811328	2016-04-27T07:02:26	willshome CallenFamily If he was raised Orthodox, he'd have known this his whole life. It's a big deal. Hence rise of Liberalism &amp; Reform.
hugorifkind	725218189785849856	2016-04-27T07:01:05	willshome CallenFamily You're also confusing Orthodox with Ultra-Orthodox, fyi.
hugorifkind	725218085284773888	2016-04-27T07:00:40	willshome CallenFamily That's a myth. One small sect doesn't. Neturei Karta. Much beloved of people with an agenda. Ie: Iran.
hugorifkind	725217381698641920	2016-04-27T06:57:52	willshome CallenFamily Not initially, no. Absolutely not. But I think it's had a major impact over the last ten years.
hugorifkind	725217147786551296	2016-04-27T06:56:56	willshome CallenFamily I suspect his wife hadn't converted. I'd be in same situation if I had any interest in Jewish burial which I don't.
hugorifkind	725216846576795648	2016-04-27T06:55:44	willshome CallenFamily Yes, but it's not relevant to Israel. It's a backwards aspect of Orthodox Judaism. Conflating the 2 is a bit 19thC.
hugorifkind	725214531761393664	2016-04-27T06:46:32	willshome CallenFamily In future, if you find arguments about Israel drifting into obscure orthodox burial requirements, I'd step back.
hugorifkind	725206039503708161	2016-04-27T06:12:48	willshome CallenFamily Careful. Mask slipping a touch, there.
hugorifkind	725204975715012608	2016-04-27T06:08:34	willshome CallenFamily it shouldn't be. Conversion is not an obscure concept.

hugorifkind	724972246096289792	2016-04-26T14:43:47	TenPercent But we're going round in circles. Nobody even WANTS to alter it in the way you suggest.

hugorifkind	724971399169859584	2016-04-26T14:40:25	4thyearshow I'm not seeing the point of a strike if it is not thought it will win public support.

hugorifkind	724971081992425473	2016-04-26T14:39:09	TenPercent Very possibly. But they conflate the NHS with the concept of free universal care, too. Knowingly or otherwise.
hugorifkind	724970849435025408	2016-04-26T14:38:14	kidneydoc101 Dannythefink DeptHealthPress "No!" you say. "So what should I do?" they say. "I have no suggestions," you say. See?

hugorifkind	724970268779753472	2016-04-26T14:35:56	TenPercent ...entail an end to free universal healthcare.
hugorifkind	724970203025645569	2016-04-26T14:35:40	TenPercent Okay, but even the end of the NHS (which I'm not in favour of, and I dont think comes from those reforms, anyway) does not ...
hugorifkind	724969993847357440	2016-04-26T14:34:50	TenPercent ... always struck me as incoherent nonsense. But it was never about scrapping free provision. No election could be won on that.
hugorifkind	724969741903863808	2016-04-26T14:33:50	TenPercent I seem to recall that the plan was to get closer to patients, via GPs rather than trusts. Look, I'm not defending this stuff...
hugorifkind	724969479311097856	2016-04-26T14:32:47	TenPercent I think it's pretty rare for a government to strategic planning that goes beyond 4 years.
hugorifkind	724969299534876672	2016-04-26T14:32:04	TenPercent Hang on, duty of care was about devolution to commissioning groups, wasn't it? Lansley nonsense.
hugorifkind	724968718380466176	2016-04-26T14:29:46	TenPercent No idea. Some legal thing? Do you think there's a secret plan?
hugorifkind	724968295187795968	2016-04-26T14:28:05	rory_yeomans private healthcare providers and health insurance are not the same thing.
hugorifkind	724968136559235072	2016-04-26T14:27:27	TenPercent Like Corbyn, you're conflating private providers with self-funded private health insurance. Totally, totally different.
hugorifkind	724967891431469057	2016-04-26T14:26:29	TenPercent ?? But they all believe in free universal healthcare. Some just think the state should pay private companies to provide it.
hugorifkind	724967582328037376	2016-04-26T14:25:15	TenPercent In fact, I think you'd even struggle to find a Tory MP who wouldn't baulk (from the left) at Obamacare.

hugorifkind	724966679667695617	2016-04-26T14:21:40	TenPercent Also, I have only met a handful of MPs. But that's not really the point.

hugorifkind	724961673795227650	2016-04-26T14:01:46	JCM_34 I don't mean unpleasant. I mean the intellectual level. But I don't specifically mean you. Thanks for your civility and engagement.
hugorifkind	724961261239324672	2016-04-26T14:00:08	4thyearshow I'm sorry, but I don't understand your question.
hugorifkind	724961088199102464	2016-04-26T13:59:27	kidneydoc101 Dannythefink Of course they're about the strike! What else are they about?

hugorifkind	724960330401603585	2016-04-26T13:56:26	JCM_34 I expected doctors, at least, to respond to it forensically. Am  appalled at the level at which some have responded, instead.

hugorifkind	724958757592117248	2016-04-26T13:50:11	kidneydoc101 Dannythefink Which bits aren't about the strike?
hugorifkind	724958596547629057	2016-04-26T13:49:33	JCM_34 Actually, it's more akin to criticising the attack on Fallujah without going in into the crimes of Saddam Hussein.
hugorifkind	724958098738262017	2016-04-26T13:47:34	JCM_34 Why? I've just told you I don't have a strong view on it.
hugorifkind	724957944568287232	2016-04-26T13:46:57	james_laurenson JCM_34 No.
hugorifkind	724957809905946624	2016-04-26T13:46:25	kidneydoc101 Come on. You're clearly an intelligent person. You can surely see I'm writing about the strike and only the strike.
hugorifkind	724957125747871745	2016-04-26T13:43:42	JCM_34 That's ridiculous. Of course you can. The column is explicitly about the tactic of a strike. Not the contract.
hugorifkind	724956222164729856	2016-04-26T13:40:07	JCM_34 Are you doing this on purpose? Of course I'm critical of the strike. I have no firm view of the contract. Two different things.
hugorifkind	724954233561354240	2016-04-26T13:32:12	kidneydoc101 Where? I said wrong to strike. Not wrong about the contract. This was pretty clear. I'd hope you'd see the difference.
hugorifkind	724953852160671745	2016-04-26T13:30:42	JCM_34 Well, I'm not, am I? I'm offering an opinion about something else. I mean, clearly.
hugorifkind	724953472936869888	2016-04-26T13:29:11	JCM_34 JonnyWmusic Don't be ridiculous. I wrote every word knowing that doctors and other people would be tweeting me about it all day.
hugorifkind	724953123438120961	2016-04-26T13:27:48	JCM_34 Might be right, the tweet says. I've no idea if they are right.
hugorifkind	724948069775740929	2016-04-26T13:07:43	kidneydoc101 I have no idea who is right. And have said as much, frequently.
hugorifkind	724935023145701376	2016-04-26T12:15:52	tristandross Seems to be a pay rise overall. Still, I'd pay them headmaster salaries, easy. Senseless that GP earn more than hosp docs.
hugorifkind	724934495942676481	2016-04-26T12:13:47	JonnyWmusic I didn't say I thought they were right. I don't know. And it wasn't an attack. I disagree with the strike. Is that not allowed?
hugorifkind	724933563683065856	2016-04-26T12:10:04	JonnyWmusic Also, the editorial said that doctors were wrong about their contracts. I didn't. I do not feel qualified to judge that.
hugorifkind	724933137738903552	2016-04-26T12:08:23	JonnyWmusic I'm not writing editorials this month, so I wasn't involved in the editorial line. And I think the public support will ebb.
hugorifkind	724932638151180288	2016-04-26T12:06:24	tristandross I thought it wasn't about pay?
hugorifkind	724931872531308544	2016-04-26T12:03:21	tristandross I think we should pay them more. So that's everybody's pensions. Yours included. Hope this helps.
hugorifkind	724930412393406464	2016-04-26T11:57:33	buchanan17 Sure. I've listened to both sides and my opinion is that my view doesn't count for much. Didn't think there was a column in that

hugorifkind	724929448164909056	2016-04-26T11:53:43	tristandross WTF are you talking about? I never mentioned anybody's pension.
hugorifkind	724929249388453888	2016-04-26T11:52:56	kayewrites not particularly. We may be at cross purposes.

hugorifkind	724927688369119233	2016-04-26T11:46:44	Very odd @ col today. Apparently, when I wrote docs might be right but shouldn't strike, I ACTUALLY meant they were wrong &amp; I love Tories.

hugorifkind	715947159116451841	2016-04-01T17:01:19	joecooknow JoeSucksmith Or is it not up to Jews to decide whether they're upset or not?

hugorifkind	715940952561598464	2016-04-01T16:36:39	JoeSucksmith I assumed it because most of the people you seem to want to fight with are.

hugorifkind	715939719549480961	2016-04-01T16:31:45	JoeSucksmith You should ask yourself why you scare these people, instead of hiding behind the assumption they must have a secret motive.

hugorifkind	715938225085358081	2016-04-01T16:25:49	JoeSucksmith mate, you were comparing Hamas to the French resistance. If you don't see the problems with that, you should.

hugorifkind	715882930518757376	2016-04-01T12:46:05	JoeSucksmith Are you saying that the accusation is that this is Momentum speaking, but it's actually just a Momentum member speaking?

hugorifkind	712632962269974528	2016-03-23T13:31:52	F03148046 AbiWilks Plus, US behaved much the same with Saudi, Mubarak Egypt, etc.
hugorifkind	712632752206659584	2016-03-23T13:31:02	F03148046 AbiWilks Don't worry. I get it. Tho the US arg would probably be that UN has a weird hard-on about Israel in the first place.
hugorifkind	712631308854370304	2016-03-23T13:25:18	From his Twitter timeline, Scotland's only UKIP MEP appears to believe that the Belgian intelligence services have been infiltrated by ISIS.
hugorifkind	712625264505827328	2016-03-23T13:01:17	F03148046 AbiWilks I think you maybe should read more about apartheid.
hugorifkind	712624286666719232	2016-03-23T12:57:24	808sdgs AbiWilks What's my "political" point?
hugorifkind	712622969319788544	2016-03-23T12:52:10	F03148046 AbiWilks There are theoretical similarities with Bantustans, etc, but in practice it's incredibly different.
hugorifkind	712622139594117124	2016-03-23T12:48:52	808sdgs AbiWilks I think that's a very pastiched depiction of somebody you disagree with, George.
hugorifkind	712618963172253696	2016-03-23T12:36:15	Seanchuckle AbiWilks Sure. I mean critics of state, not of actions of state. Apols, I see that was unclear. I'd consider myself a critic.
hugorifkind	712618535537754113	2016-03-23T12:34:33	808sdgs AbiWilks I wasn't replying to a request for research. But nor are these things I've imagined.
hugorifkind	712618364116602880	2016-03-23T12:33:52	AbiWilks And by "you" I obviously don't mean YOU, obvs.
hugorifkind	712618274589122560	2016-03-23T12:33:31	AbiWilks In a nutshell, the moment you regard Israel as a Western project, not just a country, you're well into the dangerzone.
hugorifkind	712617971840126977	2016-03-23T12:32:18	AbiWilks ...Israeli offences are a world away from, for eg, Russian ones or Syrian ones, which tends to be the level where sanctions start.
hugorifkind	712617823869263872	2016-03-23T12:31:43	AbiWilks Reluctance to support sanctions, etc. Whereas I think the West doesn't sanction Israel because, in the global scheme of things...
hugorifkind	712617639223377921	2016-03-23T12:30:59	AbiWilks So am I. But I don't think it "gets away" with them because of Western acquiescence. Whereas many do.
hugorifkind	712616854242594816	2016-03-23T12:27:52	AbiWilks As for the jump between 4&amp;5, sure. Corbyn clearly doesn't make it. But once he's got that far, it's almost illogical he stops.
hugorifkind	712616547349606400	2016-03-23T12:26:39	AbiWilks The jump between 3 and 4 is pretty universal among critics of Israel. Never regarded as just a country. Always a global project.
hugorifkind	712615959563997187	2016-03-23T12:24:19	AbiWilks Personally, I'm not sure where even quite senior members of the opposition depart from that worldview. Hence the problem.
hugorifkind	712615832002674688	2016-03-23T12:23:48	AbiWilks ...neocon conspiracy. 4. you decide that Israel is a product of this conspiracy. 5.you consider jews complicit in every step.
hugorifkind	712615557397417986	2016-03-23T12:22:43	AbiWilks 2. Yet elections don't reflect this. 3. Thus, you decide that the powerful are twisting democracy, globally, and believe in a...
hugorifkind	712615267147333632	2016-03-23T12:21:34	AbiWilks It's not so simple. It's the endpoint of views that are far more widespread. 1.You believe that most people must agree with you..

hugorifkind	712589890601558016	2016-03-23T10:40:43	Akabilky Anyway, must work. Thanks for your time.
hugorifkind	712589733961023490	2016-03-23T10:40:06	Akabilky But I thought you want us to be peripheral?
hugorifkind	712589653023584257	2016-03-23T10:39:47	Akabilky History also shows extreme British effectiveness at opting out of bits we don't fancy, such as Schengen and the euro.
hugorifkind	712588959625441281	2016-03-23T10:37:01	Akabilky Then I remain unclear as to the problem.
hugorifkind	712588845909458944	2016-03-23T10:36:34	Akabilky Even if so, that's so banal as to be almost meaningless. You could say the same about using a satnav.
hugorifkind	712588673049628672	2016-03-23T10:35:53	Akabilky Whereas if you don't, it isn't.
hugorifkind	712588623602966528	2016-03-23T10:35:41	Akabilky Again, this is only a concern if you consider it evident that the EU is a malign project from which we'll eventually need to flee.
hugorifkind	712588055409008640	2016-03-23T10:33:26	Akabilky ... this is a problem. But if you don't, it isn't. Like worrying we forget how to hunt when we start shopping.
hugorifkind	712587921551933440	2016-03-23T10:32:54	Akabilky ok, but even if that's true, it's circular. In that, if you start from the view that it's bad to function as a group, then...
hugorifkind	712586652464578560	2016-03-23T10:27:51	Akabilky Your argument is that by participating in supranational agreements, we incrementally lose the ability to function as a nation?
hugorifkind	712586345835798528	2016-03-23T10:26:38	Akabilky of course
hugorifkind	712585278335164416	2016-03-23T10:22:24	Akabilky what do you mean "takes the ground"?
hugorifkind	712584743775313920	2016-03-23T10:20:16	SarahDuggers Mild Jew-hating. It'll pass. Walk it off.
hugorifkind	712584324504231936	2016-03-23T10:18:36	Drip, drip, drip. 
hugorifkind	712583744578781184	2016-03-23T10:16:18	Akabilky Plus, the EU is us, anyway. Not somebody else.
hugorifkind	712583500864552960	2016-03-23T10:15:20	Akabilky But hardly any are exclusive, in that case, and those which are, are about evidently group affairs.
hugorifkind	712582039229308929	2016-03-23T10:09:31	Akabilky Thanks. But if your case rests upon "shared" not really meaning "shared" then I think we're stuck.
hugorifkind	712579309635047424	2016-03-23T09:58:41	Akabilky You linked to "Page Not Found". Fittingly enough.
hugorifkind	712578031588614148	2016-03-23T09:53:36	Akabilky When somebody can only talk about principle it means they aren't  actually talking about anything.
hugorifkind	712571362859163648	2016-03-23T09:27:06	Akabilky PowellPolitics humour me. Any detail.
hugorifkind	712570316032237568	2016-03-23T09:22:56	Akabilky PowellPolitics which EU functions do you have in mind?
hugorifkind	712570245601497088	2016-03-23T09:22:40	Akabilky PowellPolitics As a sovereign nation, Britain should have an army. If there's also a combined EU force, who cares?

hugorifkind	712564755706339329	2016-03-23T09:00:51	PowellPolitics But it's true. If your objection comes down to a fear of eventual oppression, then that's simply baseless.
hugorifkind	712564237126803456	2016-03-23T08:58:47	PowellPolitics tin foil hat.
hugorifkind	712561264027942912	2016-03-23T08:46:58	PowellPolitics that's what the word means.
hugorifkind	712561220679835648	2016-03-23T08:46:48	PowellPolitics it's the rules of a club we freely choose to be in. For the millionth time, we're sovereign if we can leave.
hugorifkind	712557959541297152	2016-03-23T08:33:50	PowellPolitics again, we're sovereign for as long as we can choose not to be part of that system. US states not sovereign. EU nations are.
hugorifkind	712557637863411712	2016-03-23T08:32:34	PowellPolitics Anyway, it's early. I didn't mean defer, because that means "delay". I meant delegate.
hugorifkind	712556986836058112	2016-03-23T08:29:58	PowellPolitics we defer when we democratically choose to. And we sit on the sidelines on for things which aren't our problem anyway.

hugorifkind	712555411820384257	2016-03-23T08:23:43	PowellPolitics oh, and I couldn't give any sort of shit about an EU army.
hugorifkind	712555288335921152	2016-03-23T08:23:14	PowellPolitics it's not supremacy. It's deferral. For as along as we can leave, we are sovereign.
hugorifkind	712554913407049728	2016-03-23T08:21:44	PowellPolitics no I don't!
hugorifkind	712551527660052480	2016-03-23T08:08:17	WeDoNotLearn73 we are all losing. Your lot just don't realise it yet.
hugorifkind	712551423142178816	2016-03-23T08:07:52	PowellPolitics I completely back a different class of EU status. Quite openly.

hugorifkind	712344648187039744	2016-03-22T18:26:13	bobrey2009 Turkey isn't joining the EU. Probably ever. Although if they do, and we mind, maybe that's when we have a referendum?

hugorifkind	712315696139481088	2016-03-22T16:31:10	SirDickOfHearts So, realistically, we're talking France. And what if France won't take them?

hugorifkind	710500777580744705	2016-03-17T16:19:20	AKMacG You should ask yourself what manner of Israel you'd be able to accept. If the honest answer is "no manner of Israel", you'll know.
hugorifkind	710500602355326980	2016-03-17T16:18:38	AKMacG I think there's a problem in failing to distinguish between the actions of israel and the existence of israel.
hugorifkind	710500001668014080	2016-03-17T16:16:15	AKMacG It doesn't conflate. It links. Because they are linked. And it's easy to unlink them if you wish. But most don't wish.

hugorifkind	702573578022219776	2016-02-24T19:19:28	BambouClub it's a country riven by poverty, inequality &amp; crime. Again, whites far less likely to be poor, rapes or murdered than others.

hugorifkind	702571696100872192	2016-02-24T19:12:00	BambouClub sure. It is heartbreaking. But it's a function of SA's whites now being exposed (but less exposed) to the same as others...
hugorifkind	702570387184422912	2016-02-24T19:06:48	BambouClub Whites are the least likely group to be murdered in SA. Why do you care more about them being killed than about other people?

hugorifkind	695361770836226048	2016-02-04T21:42:20	donovanian999 msutton I don't think he should be extradited to the US, or face charges over Wikileaks. I'm clear on that. So, no, I'm not.
hugorifkind	695360594472374272	2016-02-04T21:37:39	donovanian999 msutton it's not a political case. UK govt doesn't give a fuck where he goes. They have no legal option.
hugorifkind	695360349629865985	2016-02-04T21:36:41	msutton donovanian999 Sure. I don't think that should have been a political decision either.
hugorifkind	695355914044346370	2016-02-04T21:19:03	donovanian999 msutton again, they have a warrant. From a court. That's what police are for. It's not like they're on the phone to the CIA.
hugorifkind	695355114941497344	2016-02-04T21:15:53	msutton donovanian999 what do you expect the police to do differently? Genuinely?
hugorifkind	695351527737675779	2016-02-04T21:01:37	msutton donovanian999 not true. It was a judge, not a politician.
hugorifkind	695351440982683648	2016-02-04T21:01:17	donovanian999 msutton maybe Google what "rule of law" means?

hugorifkind	695340388366680066	2016-02-04T20:17:22	donovanian999 msutton At any rate, immaterial. Legal decisions, not political ones. You either believe in the rule of law or you don't.
hugorifkind	695340187132428288	2016-02-04T20:16:34	donovanian999 msutton the charges thing is contentious. I understand that Sweden brings charges at a later point in the criminal process.
hugorifkind	695333024729317377	2016-02-04T19:48:06	donovanian999 msutton except a British court disagreed. Whereupon the right thing to do is to extradite. None of this is arbitrary.
hugorifkind	695325955838107650	2016-02-04T19:20:01	donovanian999 msutton this is all a matter for Swedish justice. It has no bearing on extradition.
hugorifkind	695300213666373633	2016-02-04T17:37:43	msutton Agree. I don't believe Assange should ever be extradited to the US. But Sweden is another matter and UK has to follow rule of law.
hugorifkind	695295534467321861	2016-02-04T17:19:08	msutton BTW, if you're genuinely interested in the detail of all this, probably worth reading DavidAllenGreen at 
hugorifkind	695295216715218944	2016-02-04T17:17:52	msutton The court had already approved extradition. I don't think it's great to just change legal procedures ad hoc for public figures, tbh
hugorifkind	695293199657615360	2016-02-04T17:09:51	msutton That's from four years ago! See this: and in particular para 3.
hugorifkind	695291940154294273	2016-02-04T17:04:51	msutton No, they tried that. Ecuador would only allow them to supply questions, not ask them. Also not really Britain's business, anyway.

hugorifkind	695277011288334336	2016-02-04T16:05:31	flashboy Exactly. All his examples are people in jail, pending troublesome extradition. That's simply not what's happening.
hugorifkind	695276575479197696	2016-02-04T16:03:47	What's the alternative here?
hugorifkind	695276529761284096	2016-02-04T16:03:36	You're the police. There's a warrant. You try to arrest somebody. You can't, it's a protected space. You wait until they leave it.
hugorifkind	695276057570709504	2016-02-04T16:01:44	I'm really trying, but I'm still not seeing it. assange 
hugorifkind	695273024610816000	2016-02-04T15:49:41	flashboy Same. I've  been wading through the Assange team's claim -  - and still utterly unclear what it could be.

hugorifkind	694931019791732736	2016-02-03T17:10:40	queenchristina_ I'm actually being serious, though. Marked lack of women feverishly wanging on about it like all the men are.
hugorifkind	694930697526628352	2016-02-03T17:09:24	SebastianEPayne Indeed. And it seems to be okay for female politicians to be EU neutral. Whereas the men are all in camps.
hugorifkind	694930523945312257	2016-02-03T17:08:42	Southsidegrrrl well, sure, only the absence in this case seems striking. You hear plenty from female politicians about benefits, etc
hugorifkind	694930309129846784	2016-02-03T17:07:51	Or do I just notice the men more because I'm a chauvinist?
hugorifkind	694930135649226752	2016-02-03T17:07:10	Like, is it just because there are more male politicians? Or because male politicians are more likely to shout at each other?
hugorifkind	694929973224808449	2016-02-03T17:06:31	Is it just me, or is there something very... male... about the EU debate? And if so, why?

hugorifkind	694854225784864768	2016-02-03T12:05:31	AbiWilks RupertMyers KateAndrs Of course, it's a whole different argument as to whether "equality" is the best thing to aim for, anyway.

hugorifkind	694853949397008384	2016-02-03T12:04:25	AbiWilks RupertMyers KateAndrs ... but then you're into "equality of opportunity" territory, which is code for "not equality".
hugorifkind	694853638968233985	2016-02-03T12:03:11	AbiWilks RupertMyers KateAndrs I guess you can have metrics of equality which don't involve income and aren't dependent on it...
hugorifkind	694853120472522752	2016-02-03T12:01:08	AbiWilks RupertMyers KateAndrs really, who among us isn't?
hugorifkind	694853043104436224	2016-02-03T12:00:49	AbiWilks RupertMyers KateAndrs sure, but so should focus on all inequality. That's basically what inequality is.
hugorifkind	694852368324825088	2016-02-03T11:58:08	AbiWilks RupertMyers KateAndrs hahahaha
hugorifkind	694852216390291456	2016-02-03T11:57:32	AbiWilks RupertMyers KateAndrs Oh, sure. Probably. But that's a truism, no? Income equality is another matter. Pakistan pretty equal.
hugorifkind	694851557280587776	2016-02-03T11:54:55	AbiWilks RupertMyers KateAndrs Obvs, if that's not what you're comparing, I'll fuck off.
hugorifkind	694851405572657152	2016-02-03T11:54:19	AbiWilks RupertMyers KateAndrs Thought you were comparing income equality with gender equality. It's not neat. See,eg, switzerland.

hugorifkind	690641537559044096	2016-01-22T21:05:48	annofarabia Sure. But there's also the question of what is considered a top role in the first place.
hugorifkind	690641303458181120	2016-01-22T21:04:52	annofarabia ... as in, 63% of US white, while 90ish% of Academy is. Reasonable to ponder which great performances would most excite them.

hugorifkind	689044597163618305	2016-01-18T11:20:08	willshome jeremycorbyn We disagree about interpreting them. You can only comprehend this as wilfull misrepresentation. I can't help that.

hugorifkind	689019229849399296	2016-01-18T09:39:20	willshome HE WAS TALKING ABOUT BACK CHANNELS. HE SAID SO.
hugorifkind	689019071178887172	2016-01-18T09:38:42	JakeWojtowicz I genuinely think the reason why it's not clear what he means is that he's not clear what he means.

hugorifkind	689017763495571456	2016-01-18T09:33:30	I hereby coin the term "Corbynterpretation" to refer to the  endless debate, after Corbyn says anything, over what he was actually on about.
hugorifkind	689017396452024320	2016-01-18T09:32:03	willshome  So he wants us to apply pressure via Saudi channels he thinks we shouldn't have?
hugorifkind	689013561205624833	2016-01-18T09:16:48	willshome I did not take that as a discussion of how to defeat them. If his plan was "get Saudi to do it" then why not just say that?
hugorifkind	689012637888344064	2016-01-18T09:13:08	willshome no he isn't. He saying they have back channels to communicate. Notion of applying pressure is wholly absent.
hugorifkind	689012025947742208	2016-01-18T09:10:42	willshome "Jeremy Corbyn is right to say that bears probably shit in the woods".
hugorifkind	689011571889192960	2016-01-18T09:08:54	willshome "stop this" was not an aspect of what he was saying. Not saying he doesn't want it, but that was not his topic.
hugorifkind	689011413822623744	2016-01-18T09:08:16	willshome that's just literally not what he said, though. How would that follow on to "not exactly dialogue" and prisoner exchange?
hugorifkind	689010650639634432	2016-01-18T09:05:14	willshome But I agree with that bit. Where's the debate?
hugorifkind	689010473862299650	2016-01-18T09:04:32	willshome again, no he isn't. Plainly. He is saying there are routes, and they are these.
hugorifkind	689010258803576832	2016-01-18T09:03:41	willshome not, "look at the source of funding to end funding".
hugorifkind	689010179078287361	2016-01-18T09:03:22	willshome but the contact doesn't mean what you say it does! He's saying "look at the source of funding to figure out how to talk to them".
hugorifkind	689009757416476672	2016-01-18T09:01:42	willshome yeah, well done him for thinking at least one sane thing.
hugorifkind	689009670892187648	2016-01-18T09:01:21	willshome that's clearly him using the eg of funding routes to show dialogue is possible.
hugorifkind	689009039913693184	2016-01-18T08:58:50	willshome this was another point he made. Not the only point he made.
hugorifkind	689001552040841216	2016-01-18T08:29:05	willshome not sure where you get "breaking their financial supply" out of this: 
hugorifkind	689001039526244353	2016-01-18T08:27:03	willshome That's in no way what he was talking about. He said "dialogue would be the wrong word to use" and then went on to suggest it.

hugorifkind	688765555915014149	2016-01-17T16:51:19	GethingsH It's not known, due to a lack of access to IS areas. Most estimates would put it at 10-15k, in past three years.

hugorifkind	688763877266485249	2016-01-17T16:44:39	GethingsH But that's just not true with most. Iraq war gives you first two. But France?? And total death toll of 50yr Is/Pal war is sub 10k
hugorifkind	688761555182317569	2016-01-17T16:35:25	GethingsH Which 10, then? You've got Saddam, and Assad, and then a major drop off.

hugorifkind	688759858343096320	2016-01-17T16:28:41	GethingsH Oh, an easy one. No.
hugorifkind	688759739338067968	2016-01-17T16:28:13	DavidMills73 I know, but I think he's wrong, too. Weird article, that. Doesn't really go anywhere.
hugorifkind	688759347673980929	2016-01-17T16:26:39	GethingsH I don't think we should offer them anything. I think we should degrade them and preach against them.

hugorifkind	688758340575490048	2016-01-17T16:22:39	GethingsH not even with a small c. And the answer is "because they're murdering, enslaving, raping fascists".

hugorifkind	688757483217752064	2016-01-17T16:19:15	GethingsH But I'm not Conservative, and I don't think that. I think I've supported one mideast intervention in my whole life.

hugorifkind	684791174427754496	2016-01-06T17:38:33	hugorifkind Hey Hugo, this on the need for more black media representation: 
hugorifkind	684711916254683137	2016-01-06T12:23:36	salem_ja Yes. I just wrote a column about this. That's what we're talking about.

hugorifkind	684708391114117120	2016-01-06T12:09:36	McAllister1973 I'm most certainly not! I'd genuinely like to know his views. He's very cagey on all things climate.
hugorifkind	684705556339240960	2016-01-06T11:58:20	Two minutes to go until PMQs, and hardly anyone is sitting on the Labour front bench
hugorifkind	684705813164875776	2016-01-06T11:59:21	salem_ja Nobody is forcing our rules on you. But that doesn't preclude us from considering your rules to be barbaric.
hugorifkind	684705215665274880	2016-01-06T11:56:59	clarity791 You seem to think no cell could have kept Saudi Arabia safe from these people. I'm afraid I don't find that very realistic.
hugorifkind	684704603309518848	2016-01-06T11:54:33	SaraBinFadliah Actually, British people rarely forget any of this.
hugorifkind	684704219815907328	2016-01-06T11:53:01	clarity791 I'm amazed you're not getting this. When a state kills prisoners, that state is barbaric. That is my concern.
hugorifkind	684703550941704192	2016-01-06T11:50:22	SaraBinFadliah khaderalshareef thetimes I agree.
hugorifkind	684703429575442432	2016-01-06T11:49:53	clarity791 I don't feel bad about the terrorists. I don't care if they die, at all. I object to a legal system which decides to kill them.
hugorifkind	684703037009596416	2016-01-06T11:48:19	clarity791 how weak you make your country sound.
hugorifkind	684701273279565824	2016-01-06T11:41:19	clarity791 Are you seriously suggesting that Saudi Arabia is incapable of holding dangerous terrorists securely in prison?
hugorifkind	684700143564767232	2016-01-06T11:36:49	clarity791 That's beside the point. Civilised states don't kill prisoners, even if those prisoners are problematic. Basic morality.
hugorifkind	684699664084504576	2016-01-06T11:34:55	salem_ja It doesn't matter what they did. That's the whole point. A civilised state imprisons people, but it doesn't execute people.
hugorifkind	684698067598217216	2016-01-06T11:28:35	clarity791 Have you actually read the article? It is far from complimentary about Iran.
hugorifkind	684697862693851136	2016-01-06T11:27:46	salem_ja Yes. One person is wrong. 47 people is a massacre.
hugorifkind	684696400588869632	2016-01-06T11:21:57	clarity791 dude, if they're in prison, they're prisoners.
hugorifkind	684695146525495296	2016-01-06T11:16:58	clarity791 That doesn't follow from what i said in any way. But you should certainly question why 15 of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi.
hugorifkind	684694766693515264	2016-01-06T11:15:28	clarity791 You're not listening. Take action, by all means. Fight daesh wherever you find them, please. Don't slaughter prisoners.
hugorifkind	684693746936590336	2016-01-06T11:11:24	clarity791 you need better prisons.
hugorifkind	684693451204653056	2016-01-06T11:10:14	clarity791 I understand the necessity of conflict, and in conflict people die. But the execution of those already in custody is barbaric.
hugorifkind	684693060811403264	2016-01-06T11:08:41	clarity791 Of course not. But a civilised state doesn't kill people when it can avoid it. Period. War is not the same thing as execution.
hugorifkind	684689682593124352	2016-01-06T10:55:15	salem_ja killing means killing. Judicial killing isn't murder. That doesn't make it moral, wise, or right.
hugorifkind	684687276648042496	2016-01-06T10:45:42	salem_ja but you just said "there was no killing"?

hugorifkind	684672534852296704	2016-01-06T09:47:07	khaderalshareef thetimes I think you miss the point. Forget the terrorists. Killing people is bad for your culture and your soul.

hugorifkind	684655289560334336	2016-01-06T08:38:35	FilmLecturer but he is core Cabinet. He's shadow foreign secretary.

hugorifkind	684654089410605056	2016-01-06T08:33:49	TheButman so a cabinet minister can stop being one for a single debate, and then start being one again? Is the point?
hugorifkind	684653908921286656	2016-01-06T08:33:06	FilmLecturer So in a free vote, can he disagree while remaining a cabinet minister or not?
hugorifkind	684651534160904192	2016-01-06T08:23:40	hugorifkind maybe he could put on a hat, or a fake moustache?
