capitalweather	726123225978134529	2016-04-29T18:57:22	People are freaking out about MercuryRetrograde. This is what's really going on.

capitalweather	726119412512731136	2016-04-29T18:42:13	windbarb afreedma yes...if melting/compaction exceed snow rate, that's negative accumulation

capitalweather	726110241058869248	2016-04-29T18:05:46	ScottDimmich Max snow depth during a storm (based on hourly measurement) as proxy for total, yes. Using a board is good, but no swipe.
capitalweather	726109662190440448	2016-04-29T18:03:28	"The NWS and FAA have not demonstrated they can competently manage a snow measurement system": 
capitalweather	726108059475562496	2016-04-29T17:57:06	ScottDimmich So irrespective of what you do, record will be non-homogeneous at some point. simpler to take boards, swiping out of equation
capitalweather	726107850523684864	2016-04-29T17:56:16	ScottDimmich True to a point, but historic records weren't using snow boards and swiping. So we have apples/oranges w/ current scheme.
capitalweather	726106169119510528	2016-04-29T17:49:35	ryanhanrahan True. Understand pros and cons for swiping...which vary depending on kind of event.
capitalweather	726105949207990276	2016-04-29T17:48:43	JPBwxman you're misunderstanding. 6hr measurements only inflate if snow board is wiped clean. i'm recommending hourly, but no board swipe
capitalweather	726105512564109312	2016-04-29T17:46:59	ScottDimmich Story talks about compaction - see last few grafs. Not worried about it.
capitalweather	726104264058241024	2016-04-29T17:42:01	ryanhanrahan Don't think you need to clear snow board. Coops and spotters don't...and wasn't done historically. Harmonization is goal.
capitalweather	726103598027948032	2016-04-29T17:39:22	ryanhanrahan Yes, for my recommendation, you would need to clear snow from previous storms.  Jason
capitalweather	726103474547646464	2016-04-29T17:38:53	ryanhanrahan I didn't discuss explicitly, but fine to put down a snow board...just leave it there and take hourly measurements.
