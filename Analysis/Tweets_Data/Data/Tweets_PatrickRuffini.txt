PatrickRuffini	726130731873910785	2016-04-29T19:27:11	Life comes at you fast 
PatrickRuffini	726090343486246916	2016-04-29T16:46:42	That's right. America isn't Bethesda. 
PatrickRuffini	726089973439541249	2016-04-29T16:45:14	BlendahTom Trump more likely to flip MS and UT to Hillary than any of the states you mentioned
PatrickRuffini	726088867129004032	2016-04-29T16:40:50	Hillary starts out in a weakened position. Normally very hard to win a 3rd Presidential in a row. Needs a cartoon character (Trump) to win.
PatrickRuffini	726088491696832512	2016-04-29T16:39:21	BlendahTom Polling so far has shown a non-Trump Republican running ahead of 2012 in upper Midwest including IA, WI, MN (the latter a reach)
PatrickRuffini	726087834453590016	2016-04-29T16:36:44	Cruz has also run a technically competent and steady campaign. This matters.
PatrickRuffini	726087608347013121	2016-04-29T16:35:50	Cruz is Hispanic, overperforms with younger voters, and as the nominee he'd be the one who dispatched Trump. That cancels out many sins.
PatrickRuffini	726086958338985984	2016-04-29T16:33:15	The GOPe continues to rally around candidates who it likes ideologically, but are remarkably UNSTEADY or flawed performers.
PatrickRuffini	726086780525633536	2016-04-29T16:32:33	Cruz is a remarkably steady and consistent performer. We won't see a 47 percent / "fundamentals of the economy are strong" from him.
PatrickRuffini	726086299594162178	2016-04-29T16:30:38	I'll grant that Cruz and Clinton have below average manner/affect, but each likely cancels the other out.
PatrickRuffini	726086024997249024	2016-04-29T16:29:33	DC elites who equate Trump and Cruz electability assume ideology matters. It doesn't. It's all manner and affect.
PatrickRuffini	726085723166748676	2016-04-29T16:28:21	For starters, in a non-Trump general, Clinton would have the worst negatives of any candidate in history.
PatrickRuffini	726085538780975104	2016-04-29T16:27:37	A generic Republican would beat Clinton by 5 points. Cruz can probably win by 2 or 3. Trump will get killed.
PatrickRuffini	726085150640099328	2016-04-29T16:26:04	Ted Cruz is a FAR better general election candidate than Donald Trump, and probably starts off in no worse than a 50/50 position.
PatrickRuffini	726084994913939457	2016-04-29T16:25:27	This is terrible political analysis, for numerous reasons 
PatrickRuffini	726082327961604097	2016-04-29T16:14:51	You guys, new ARG poll! Cruz has Indiana locked up. 
PatrickRuffini	726081134988242945	2016-04-29T16:10:07	Prediction: Trumpbots will disappear if he becomes the nominee.

PatrickRuffini	726051328682766336	2016-04-29T14:11:40	Whether you endorsed against Trump or are working to stop him is a threshold credibility question. Others should not receive our support.
PatrickRuffini	725912964344090625	2016-04-29T05:01:52	It's not the GOP establishment fighting to stop Trump. They're spineless and DGAF. It's principled conservatives.
PatrickRuffini	725854153684066305	2016-04-29T01:08:10	Only one side is telling voters to sit down and shut up and that's the Trumpists.
PatrickRuffini	725853231352438784	2016-04-29T01:04:30	Literally every scenario in which Trump is not the nominee is better than every one that he is across every dimension
PatrickRuffini	725851705720467457	2016-04-29T00:58:26	This story sounds to be a case where the reporter called around to a bunch of folks and asked "It's over, right?"

PatrickRuffini	725738532598341633	2016-04-28T17:28:44	There are so many non-ideological tasks that the president does, which we have been able to take for granted. But with Trump we can't.

PatrickRuffini	721002533989257216	2016-04-15T15:49:34	Recall that last week Scavino retweeted a video from a twin account of Trumpbot overlord Microchip.
PatrickRuffini	721002273392955393	2016-04-15T15:48:32	And based on the 30k+ mentions I've received over the last week, Trumpbots get VERY touchy when you mention this.
PatrickRuffini	721002049010274304	2016-04-15T15:47:38	And this is an account that Trump himself has retweeted. He has retweeted many more like this.
PatrickRuffini	721001844647010304	2016-04-15T15:46:49	We don't know yet if the campaign is paying for this or has a role, but the effort seems extremely regimented and professionalized.
PatrickRuffini	720998848978677760	2016-04-15T15:34:55	This is a pattern that is repeated over and over again in the Trump Twitterverse. Aged accounts who started tweeting Trump all of a sudden.

PatrickRuffini	720996659845603328	2016-04-15T15:26:13	The don_vito_08 Twitter account that Trump retweeted with the pic of Heidi Cruz is emblematic of how the Trump network seems to operate.

PatrickRuffini	720407212947021825	2016-04-14T00:23:58	When any of these things failed, the establishment settled upon a false narrative that they were losers politically and should be dropped

PatrickRuffini	720406262022844418	2016-04-14T00:20:12	I think the "establishment" shoulders some of the blame here, tbh
PatrickRuffini	720405499175305217	2016-04-14T00:17:10	And this leads to the politics of grievance. It's not a disagreement over issues. It's that the establishment/whomever hates you personally.
PatrickRuffini	720405199496437760	2016-04-14T00:15:58	The failure to elevate ideas invited this. When you don't have ideas, everything becomes personal.
PatrickRuffini	720404963973861376	2016-04-14T00:15:02	This has changed. Now, people with ideas are in the minority, on all sides of the party.
PatrickRuffini	720404781450137600	2016-04-14T00:14:19	I identified with conservatives at a young age because I thought they had the ideas and the moderates in the party didn't.
PatrickRuffini	720404613044670464	2016-04-14T00:13:38	People with ideas deserve our respect, regardless of their DW-NOMINATE score. People who don't deserve our scorn.

PatrickRuffini	720403852684574720	2016-04-14T00:10:37	Calling someone a "crazy right wing conservative" is factionalism. And railing against the establishment is factionalism.
PatrickRuffini	720403343789658112	2016-04-14T00:08:36	Even without Trump, we've been headed down the destructive road of factionalism and cliques

PatrickRuffini	717601743434039296	2016-04-06T06:36:02	Some states are stronger or weaker for Trump -- NY will be good -- but overall he’s not gaining much as other candidates drop out. (3/)
PatrickRuffini	717588276677320704	2016-04-06T05:42:31	Will depend on the strength Kasich can show in polling 
PatrickRuffini	717573560479428608	2016-04-06T04:44:03	AllenWPA I'm hard pressed to show where he has gained votes throughout the process. Maybe his Chicago rally stunt on 3/15, but that's it.
