fwred	710811285810782208	2016-03-18T12:53:11	Think the most important point Praet interview was this—also exactly what Draghi said yesterday eve. 
fwred	710780381272866816	2016-03-18T10:50:23	Shorter ecb: trade-weighted EUR (+5bp), oil (+15bp) and QE2 (+20-30bp) should push inflation to target by 2018 (1.6 -&gt; ~2%). All fine!
fwred	710779405744873472	2016-03-18T10:46:30	In other words, despite EUR/USD strength, recent market developments imply *upside* risks (20bp) to ECB staff HICP projections.
fwred	710779103293607937	2016-03-18T10:45:18	The 1% drop in the trade-weighted EUR since cut-off date would add 5bp to inflation. Add another 15bp from the 13% rise in oil.
fwred	710778832089948160	2016-03-18T10:44:13	After the helluva week in FX, EUR/USD is 1.4% stronger than assumed by ECB staff, but EER-38 is still 1% *lower*. 
fwred	710753982000570368	2016-03-18T09:05:29	CapEconEurope (I meant *they* should stop the negativity, not you)
fwred	710752444691648512	2016-03-18T08:59:22	CapEconEurope I think he was fully aware of the trade-off and the risks; Praet makes the point, too

fwred	710743061282816000	2016-03-18T08:22:05	I'll remember this one by Praet: "negative rates served us very well in the past". He was the one pushing for cuts in 2015. Let's move on.

fwred	710740610240671744	2016-03-18T08:12:21	jeuasommenulle indeed!
fwred	710740435602415616	2016-03-18T08:11:39	mdbaccardax read Praet in full and you'll see how he describes it as a trade-off. To me it's quite explicit.
fwred	710739685702836224	2016-03-18T08:08:40	jeuasommenulle yes, you're right, probably have to book it at 0% (...) and take any profit ex post

fwred	710734443967881216	2016-03-18T07:47:50	Very interesting from Pictet, super-credit easing could work, QE-elasticity 
fwred	710734420299358208	2016-03-18T07:47:45	tomashirstecon I'd say reduced currency effects first, the bank profitability, then issues with "creditors"
fwred	710733072136806400	2016-03-18T07:42:23	Praet on helicopter money: "Yes, all central banks can do it. You can issue currency and distribute it to people."
fwred	710732838744825856	2016-03-18T07:41:28	Consistent with existing models, the March package can be expected to boost inflation by ~0.3%. 
fwred	710732491192053761	2016-03-18T07:40:05	Praet on staff forecasts: "The measures we took should bring us close to the 2% target by end-2018" (from 1.6% in the March projections).
fwred	710731797227823104	2016-03-18T07:37:19	tomashirstecon yes the content of the interview is clear; headlines, less so
fwred	710730699192532992	2016-03-18T07:32:58	And that's a fair point - the strengthening in ECB's forward guidance has been understated (rates low post QE + TLTROs II).
fwred	710730391875887104	2016-03-18T07:31:44	Praet was probably among those who insisted to keep the "rates at present OR LOWER levels" bit in the introductory statement.
fwred	710729866199621632	2016-03-18T07:29:39	It can be seen as a threat (only) in light of other comments by Praet on FX and banks' profitability but still, what for? EUR unimpressed.
fwred	710728946518781952	2016-03-18T07:26:00	Now that's a really confusing and unhelpful comment if you ask me.

fwred	710416649912983552	2016-03-17T10:45:02	MxSba not the ones that really matter imo
fwred	710415784649039873	2016-03-17T10:41:36	So overall, a bad month for € (core) inflation - a key driver of ECB's action - though to me more than 50% of the drop was temporary.
fwred	710415554864140288	2016-03-17T10:40:41	The share of HICP components in negative territory went back up to 30% in February. 
fwred	710414808026357760	2016-03-17T10:37:43	Euro area 'super core' inflation down from 1.0% to 0.8% in February, based on JMurray804's work replicating ECB's.
fwred	710410250051002368	2016-03-17T10:19:37	Trend in NEIG inflation still broadly encouraging, although a stronger EUR is a risk from there. 
fwred	710409725947551744	2016-03-17T10:17:32	EA services inflation is the one to watch. Trending down, but Feb one-offs should be reversed (package holidays). 
fwred	710408573369655300	2016-03-17T10:12:57	The 40bp upward revision to non-energy industrial goods (NEIG) inflation kind of challenges the idea of 2nd round FX effects.

fwred	710405481882329088	2016-03-17T10:00:40	Core HICP inflation revised higher from 0.7% to 0.8% as expected. Should grind higher in the short-term as one-offs fade.

fwred	702781517857214464	2016-02-25T09:05:45	So credit recovery still on track through January, but preemptive ecb action still need to insure against market risks.

fwred	702763222475120640	2016-02-25T07:53:03	Banks in Spain, France and Italy have the largest TLTRO (maximum) allowances based on recent credit dynamics.
fwred	702763110185177088	2016-02-25T07:52:36	At current pace, banks could borrow up to €235bn from the ECB on top of outstanding loans (212bn in ‘stock’ TLTRO + 205bn in ‘flow’ TLTRO).

fwred	702762272515563524	2016-02-25T07:49:17	A strong rebound in credit flows should be expected in January (BLS)… unless market stress has an impact already. 
fwred	702761983205122048	2016-02-25T07:48:08	The setback was due to a collapse in short-term loans (-€35bn) and another contraction in Dutch flows, aka the outlier.

fwred	690175024179847173	2016-01-21T14:12:03	Note that the tone of the article was quite balanced, if not slightly worried. That was when oil was still at $50.
fwred	690174543206453248	2016-01-21T14:10:08	It's all about indirect effects of oil on inflation. The ECB put those at around 1/3 of total in a Dec-14 article.

fwred	690171690052096001	2016-01-21T13:58:48	Draghi repeats it, again and again: ECB mandate is price stability, not to protect banks' profitability. So, no problem to cut rates again.
