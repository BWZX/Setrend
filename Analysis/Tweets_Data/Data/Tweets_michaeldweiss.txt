michaeldweiss	709688680525524992	2016-03-15T10:32:21	Few thoughts from me on Putin's "withdrawal" from Syria: 
michaeldweiss	709461146986811392	2016-03-14T19:28:13	hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh sh************t 
michaeldweiss	709450938432356352	2016-03-14T18:47:39	With Putin withdrawal I will be able to restart posting fresh sat imagery again. I have quite a backlog of interesting material
michaeldweiss	709447179811823616	2016-03-14T18:32:43	What Vladimir Putin Learned From The Arab Spring  Syria syria5years 
michaeldweiss	709455056509276160	2016-03-14T19:04:01	Russian intervention changed the game in Syria, forcing the rebels' international backers to accommodate a settlement favourable to regime.
michaeldweiss	709454330835808256	2016-03-14T19:01:08	Kremlin media's three options: 1. ISIS is destroyed, we won, 2. We have failed in our avowed war aim, 3. Toria Nuland is a neocon lizard.
michaeldweiss	709453552855457792	2016-03-14T18:58:02	PT: And ISIS also explicitly noted that the rebels Russia was bombing were definitionally anti-ISIS ("Sahwa allies of America").
michaeldweiss	709452976000266240	2016-03-14T18:55:45	Worth recalling that even ISIS said Russia wasn't bombing ISIS, in Dabiq a few months back: 
michaeldweiss	709452293532475392	2016-03-14T18:53:02	The real reason? Three words: Trump Plaza Hama.
michaeldweiss	709451909116067841	2016-03-14T18:51:30	"Russia will maintain an aviation support centre in Syria in order to monitor compliance with the ceasefire.": 
michaeldweiss	709450966488195072	2016-03-14T18:47:46	FSA now on backfoot in north; US abandoned proxies (ergo, won't back them to challenge Assad); Latakia secure. Not a bad six months.
michaeldweiss	709448546257391618	2016-03-14T18:38:09	"No indication" Russian troops have started pulling out of Syria, per US official, "no signals of retrograde or withdrawal" voaalert
michaeldweiss	709448802617462787	2016-03-14T18:39:10	ISIS actually increased its attacks in Aleppo as a result of Russian sorties against anti-ISIS rebels: 
michaeldweiss	709436468582883329	2016-03-14T17:50:09	Russia sent it's warplanes to Syria officially to fight ISIS. Only 10% of missions were against ISIS. Now they're leaving &amp; ISIS still there
michaeldweiss	709443356821168128	2016-03-14T18:17:31	5. "Cessation of hostilities" is not so much cessation, but now reduced Syrian/Ru airstrikes have tacit US backing. So smaller footprint OK.
michaeldweiss	709442282920009729	2016-03-14T18:13:15	4. The big Russian air show &amp; weapons/tech expo is over. Enough missiles landed in Iran. Now come the juicy Rosoboronexport contracts.
michaeldweiss	709441998680408064	2016-03-14T18:12:07	3. KSA/Qatar, et al have run more weapons in, escalation met with escalation (though tbh, TOW quotient seem minimal now)
michaeldweiss	709441563185836032	2016-03-14T18:10:24	2. Rebels deemed sufficiently battered and hamstrung in Halab as to pose no threat to main regime/Iranian "equities"...
michaeldweiss	709441087547559937	2016-03-14T18:08:30	Possibilities, assuming this is legit. In no particular order of importance: 1. "Plan B" has been agreed w/ US. See:
