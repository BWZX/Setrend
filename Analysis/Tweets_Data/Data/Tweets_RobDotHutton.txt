RobDotHutton	709670577049620480	2016-03-15T09:20:25	60 percent of UK capital stock is housing, says JohnKayFT. So most capital allocation for banking is home lending - unsophisticated work.
RobDotHutton	709669962298880001	2016-03-15T09:17:58	Meanwhile modern corporations such as Apple, Google, Facebook are cash-heavy and capital-light, says JohnKayFT.
RobDotHutton	709669684216467456	2016-03-15T09:16:52	Idea that finance needed to support industrial investment also outdated, says JohnKayFT. Even capital-intensive ExxonMobil self-financing.
RobDotHutton	709668873457561600	2016-03-15T09:13:39	Most people who work in banking work maintaining the payments system, and earn relatively little, says JohnKayFT.

RobDotHutton	709667641783410688	2016-03-15T09:08:45	Lending to business no longer the main activity of banks, says JohnKayFT. Loans to non-financial firms less than 3% of activity.
RobDotHutton	709666907947929600	2016-03-15T09:05:50	In recent decades, JohnKayFT says, banking became something for much cleverer boys, who turned out to do a much worse job.
RobDotHutton	709666552501637120	2016-03-15T09:04:25	Remembering his Sixties childhood in Edinburgh, JohnKayFT: "Banking was a job for boys who weren't going to get quite good enough grades."
