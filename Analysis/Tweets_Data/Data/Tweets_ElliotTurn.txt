ElliotTurn	684392776444866560	2016-01-05T15:15:27	This is a line only finance people can come up with. So naive of history, not objectively verifiable &amp; meaningless for LT investment.

ElliotTurn	682593599607959552	2015-12-31T16:06:10	montoyan 1logic Brand recognition, global presence, relationship w directors, part of DLB competes w 100% IMAX' resources.
ElliotTurn	682593044307275781	2015-12-31T16:03:58	montoyan 1logic From what I've seen, DLB's 10 year pipeline is as big as IMAX screens added/yr. Big head start, collabs w studios, etc.
ElliotTurn	682592631763922945	2015-12-31T16:02:20	montoyan 1logic Most comparable to new IMAX laser projection. At this pt hard to see too big a threat, though is better than other PLF.
