ShippersUnbound	711486696093851648	2016-03-20T09:37:01	IDS says the big problem was that the welfare cap was "lowered pretty arbitrarily"
ShippersUnbound	711486398256250880	2016-03-20T09:35:50	IDS says the disability changes should have been separate from the budget. "We came under pressure to respond before the budget"

ShippersUnbound	701521063398797312	2016-02-21T21:37:09	Have read the Boris column twice. If that's a case for actual exit - as opposed to leverage for another negotiation - then I'm a Dutchman.
ShippersUnbound	701528230830985220	2016-02-21T22:05:38	Why Boris decided. This is the key bit of his article. The sovereignty lock, designed solely for him, does not work 
ShippersUnbound	701527090152271877	2016-02-21T22:01:06	Boris is backing a No vote but not necessarily Brexit. Last February he told me he wanted to lead the renegotiation. He still does.
ShippersUnbound	701526638522195968	2016-02-21T21:59:19	Boris's article makes clear he still wants to have his cake and eat it - a no vote to get concessions. It is au revoir to Brussels not adieu

ShippersUnbound	701407419826626560	2016-02-21T14:05:35	Boris's leadership plan had been to slowly gather support and credibility as a minister. This is a tearing up of that plan.
