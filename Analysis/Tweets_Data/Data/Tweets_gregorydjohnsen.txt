gregorydjohnsen	684378611437170688	2016-01-05T14:19:10	My broader point on Huthis is that Iran - whatever support, which I think is minimal - doesn't exercise any command and control over group.

gregorydjohnsen	684377649553211392	2016-01-05T14:15:21	DavidKenner I think that is what was implied, that the Huthis need Iranian support to exist. I could be wrong, but that is how I read it.
gregorydjohnsen	684377132030668800	2016-01-05T14:13:18	To claim or suggest that the Huthis are backed by Iran - wouldn't exist without Iran's support - is simply false and bad journalism.
