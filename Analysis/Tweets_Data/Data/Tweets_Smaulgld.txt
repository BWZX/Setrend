Smaulgld	725137433122197504	2016-04-27T01:40:11	StojBoj the joke is no judgement,inflated sense of self, what "fight" is he fighting? He's not battling cancer or for orphans-its for HIM
Smaulgld	725137106926972928	2016-04-27T01:38:53	StojBoj of course many see Trump as a joke- but at least he wins

Smaulgld	723931593618952193	2016-04-23T17:48:36	Wolf_InTheWilds of course but not conclusive
Smaulgld	723930407838842880	2016-04-23T17:43:53	Wolf_InTheWilds but I do point out the facts that beg for attention but I don't insist that they mean X or y
Smaulgld	723930263353458689	2016-04-23T17:43:19	Wolf_InTheWilds as an analyst- I try not to "conclude" anything until it can be proven
Smaulgld	723930074303614976	2016-04-23T17:42:34	Wolf_InTheWilds No audit of Fort Knox makes even less sense than 8 years to return German gold
Smaulgld	723929743062609920	2016-04-23T17:41:15	Wolf_InTheWilds yes QE pissed them off and they were public about that-doesnt mean there is no gold at Fort knox-means china like gold!
Smaulgld	723929459875831808	2016-04-23T17:40:07	Wolf_InTheWilds yes incomplete info re Shanghai imports
Smaulgld	723929348693221376	2016-04-23T17:39:41	Wolf_InTheWilds aware of all these facts and data point- they are fodder for speculation-just like "belgium"
Smaulgld	723928785079377920	2016-04-23T17:37:26	Wolf_InTheWilds none of this proves there is no gold at the fed or fort knox!
Smaulgld	723928657882939392	2016-04-23T17:36:56	Wolf_InTheWilds of course-China MINED more than 1800 tonnes in past decade 
Smaulgld	723928302566645760	2016-04-23T17:35:31	Wolf_InTheWilds I know. follow each update 
Smaulgld	723928080251797506	2016-04-23T17:34:38	Wolf_InTheWilds it doesnt mean that at all-that is a supposition based on partially know facts
Smaulgld	723927834176184321	2016-04-23T17:33:40	Wolf_InTheWilds exactly and maybe not.The amt PBOC says they have may be accurate. Amount "china" has is different 
Smaulgld	723927478532710402	2016-04-23T17:32:15	Wolf_InTheWilds hard to think of any other explanation,but there may be one.The amount that they asked for IS available on open market
Smaulgld	723927141801426947	2016-04-23T17:30:55	Wolf_InTheWilds  most newly mined gold goes to jewelry, "investment gold" comes from existing stocks &amp; gets moved around by central banks
Smaulgld	723926779854000129	2016-04-23T17:29:28	Wolf_InTheWilds  what if WGC data is wrong? They were terribly wrong re PBOC holdings prior to their July 2015 announcement
Smaulgld	723926406648991744	2016-04-23T17:27:59	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec Ok good luck-and what is the reward for solving the riddle of where all the gold is and where it goes?
Smaulgld	723926123894190081	2016-04-23T17:26:52	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec who said it was-official data pegs more than 50% of annual gold production is for jewelry
Smaulgld	723925783450935296	2016-04-23T17:25:31	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec correct so how much, if any, do you assume that 1/3 of the world's gold held by CBs is with them?
Smaulgld	723925085283868674	2016-04-23T17:22:44	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec all you can do is make your model work and hope your assumptions &amp; data are correct-no different than the Fed!

Smaulgld	723924614695497728	2016-04-23T17:20:52	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec central banks only hold about a third world gold-some estimates say Indian citizens hold more than the top 10

Smaulgld	723924075052195840	2016-04-23T17:18:44	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec if you can trust the #'s 
Smaulgld	723923922715070464	2016-04-23T17:18:07	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec US "supposdely"  has 8100 tons of gold. There are estimates of 110,000 tons in the world-What does that prove?
Smaulgld	723923694846877696	2016-04-23T17:17:13	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec riddle- according to Silver Institute silver has been in deficit for 12 yrs -where's the silver coming from?
Smaulgld	723923259511681024	2016-04-23T17:15:29	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec you need to know what are the known and unknown stocks and how large they are- we don't know

Smaulgld	723922826013618176	2016-04-23T17:13:46	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec exercise is more straightfoward when trying to figure out silver as there are no stockpiles-but still imprecise
Smaulgld	723922473083920384	2016-04-23T17:12:22	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec estimated ranges based in part on assumptions don't prove anything with "mathematical certainty"
Smaulgld	723922282859618304	2016-04-23T17:11:36	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec nearly all of it comes from stock
Smaulgld	723922096158588929	2016-04-23T17:10:52	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec the bulk of investment gold demand comes from existing stockpiles. most of newly mined gold goes to jewelery
Smaulgld	723921626589462528	2016-04-23T17:09:00	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec unlike silver, current demand for gold is met by Existing supplies not current mining production
Smaulgld	723921319411212289	2016-04-23T17:07:47	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec track that too- exports from switzerland. You still cant "prove" anything from the available data

Smaulgld	723920406378369024	2016-04-23T17:04:09	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec the one thing we do KNOW is that more gold and silver is "traded" than physically exists

Smaulgld	723919852809916416	2016-04-23T17:01:57	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec there may be reasons you are not seeing or you may be definitively right-we'll never know
Smaulgld	723919673302110208	2016-04-23T17:01:14	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec doesn have to be for "hiding" could be for practical convenience
Smaulgld	723919303465152515	2016-04-23T16:59:46	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec just as I have no view on how much gold "China" or Fort Knox has. Some people insist they know- they don't
Smaulgld	723919148305268739	2016-04-23T16:59:09	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec We are talking slightly informed opinions based on snippets and hearsay- I have no firm view on what PBOC does

Smaulgld	723918630145146881	2016-04-23T16:57:05	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec why would it be $500B?  all of" belgium" holds just a fifth of that
Smaulgld	723918372468080640	2016-04-23T16:56:04	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec it may make sense for CIC international to have a belgian/lux Tbond acct to draw from to make investments
Smaulgld	723917976190214146	2016-04-23T16:54:29	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec CIC has three branches CIC International responsible for internatonal equity/bond investments holds tbonds
Smaulgld	723917397695012864	2016-04-23T16:52:12	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec True, but someone/some entities are holding via Lux/Belg via proxies for reasons we dont' know
Smaulgld	723917216857645060	2016-04-23T16:51:28	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec True again
Smaulgld	723916838036451328	2016-04-23T16:49:58	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec USTbonds are by far the most liquid, most widely held security in the world
Smaulgld	723916494808186880	2016-04-23T16:48:36	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec yes, that is why I refer to them as Treasury holdings not investments
Smaulgld	723916173541253121	2016-04-23T16:47:20	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec by their short term nature, they're not permanent but CIC lists Tbonds in "cash" position which is permanant
Smaulgld	723915437591920641	2016-04-23T16:44:24	prchovanec Wolf_InTheWilds exactly
Smaulgld	723915297305034752	2016-04-23T16:43:51	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec The CIC doesn't "invest" in short term treasuries, they achieve returns over 5% a year not from treasuries!
Smaulgld	723914799470510080	2016-04-23T16:41:52	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec That may or may not be true-all eggs in one basket not the best strategy

Smaulgld	723913844876292096	2016-04-23T16:38:04	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec for liquidity purposes short term US securites are a good choice for chinese state entities
Smaulgld	723912807427805185	2016-04-23T16:33:57	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec clearly the bonds listed at Belgium,l Luxembourg and Ireland are not held by those Central banks
Smaulgld	723912596173262849	2016-04-23T16:33:07	Wolf_InTheWilds prchovanec The bulk of "China's" bonds are at the PBOC. They/other State-owned Chinese entitiels COULD hold them elsewhere

Smaulgld	712612717207674880	2016-03-23T12:11:26	.AnnRhefn that is a story intentionally planted so ppl focus on the crisis actor angle-again media controlling the narrative
