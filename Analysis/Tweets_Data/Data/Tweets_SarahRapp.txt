SarahRapp	715750455645716480	2016-04-01T03:59:41	Wow. 
SarahRapp	715744657133723648	2016-04-01T03:36:38	CalvinStarnesOG Superman's grin when his jaw turns back to steel was fantastic, though.
SarahRapp	715744600430915584	2016-04-01T03:36:25	CalvinStarnesOG I think I was internally yelling JUST TALK ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS-KIDNAPPED MOM at this point.
SarahRapp	715743937386962944	2016-04-01T03:33:47	CalvinStarnesOG Sorry Calvin, apparently I have a lot of feelings on this, too.
SarahRapp	715743517776207873	2016-04-01T03:32:07	CalvinStarnesOG though honestly, couldn't Superman have been a bit, yo, my mom's been kidnapped earlier in that fight? IDK IDK
SarahRapp	715743376767893504	2016-04-01T03:31:33	CalvinStarnesOG I'll say this: the fight Batman does rescuing ~Martha~ was so great.
SarahRapp	715743237407899648	2016-04-01T03:31:00	CalvinStarnesOG I have no idea, sir.
SarahRapp	715742740433252353	2016-04-01T03:29:01	CalvinStarnesOG pretty sure he's her love interest in the film
SarahRapp	715742530957139969	2016-04-01T03:28:11	CalvinStarnesOG It was, yep.
SarahRapp	715742321174781952	2016-04-01T03:27:21	CalvinStarnesOG Did you like Wonder Woman though? *hearts in eyes emoji*
SarahRapp	715741990005186560	2016-04-01T03:26:02	CalvinStarnesOG Don't blame her for the multiple kidnappings. I like Amy Adams acting, just wish she was maybe given more to do.
SarahRapp	715741870534627334	2016-04-01T03:25:34	CalvinStarnesOG It would have been nice if she could have retrieved the little spear without needing to have been rescued.
SarahRapp	715741732130988032	2016-04-01T03:25:01	CalvinStarnesOG mm, okay. I thought he just wanted to see the world burn. Also if he lives in Metropolis, will stupid monster destroy him?
SarahRapp	715740755512442881	2016-04-01T03:21:08	CalvinStarnesOG also what was the editing? Such weird transitions. Why wasn't Lois competent at any point?
SarahRapp	715740697723342849	2016-04-01T03:20:54	CalvinStarnesOG I have zero skin in the Marvel/DC game, but it would have been nice if Lex Luthor's plot made any sense.
SarahRapp	715624497513172992	2016-03-31T19:39:10	CalvinStarnesOG KetchupSnowman actually the first happens in the next scene 😱
SarahRapp	715621037589835776	2016-03-31T19:25:25	CalvinStarnesOG KetchupSnowman also I have my own job and credit score and apartment. Not possible in the past. Kilts are a+ though
SarahRapp	715620900272476160	2016-03-31T19:24:52	CalvinStarnesOG KetchupSnowman yep, I choose modern plumbing and antibiotics
SarahRapp	715620570818355201	2016-03-31T19:23:34	KetchupSnowman mm, I don't, but I love Claire and Jamie
SarahRapp	715619442730921984	2016-03-31T19:19:05	KetchupSnowman I love this
