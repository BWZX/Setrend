Thomas_Drake1	683723873892855809	2016-01-03T18:57:29	Those complaining abt Bundy's militia not getting a lot of attention: it's prolly better if he gets little to none (including interviews).

Thomas_Drake1	683371991613763584	2016-01-02T19:39:13	Welcome back to the Twitterverse RealJamesRisen ! Looking forward to your history lessons. US Republic crossed the Rubicon a long time ago.
Thomas_Drake1	678793609211207680	2015-12-21T04:26:22	A critique of the United States today? No, the Roman Republic in 49 BC, when Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon with the 13th Legion.
Thomas_Drake1	678792546705870848	2015-12-21T04:22:09	The status quo was maintained by a corrupt aristocracy, which saw no need to change a system that had made its members rich.
Thomas_Drake1	678792448005554176	2015-12-21T04:21:45	With a weak central government, political corruption had spiraled out of control.
Thomas_Drake1	678792335652712448	2015-12-21T04:21:18	The central government had become powerless. The army had replaced the constitution as the means of accomplishing political goals.
Thomas_Drake1	678792111777542144	2015-12-21T04:20:25	It was clear how dysfunctional the Republic had become. The republican machinery had broken under the weight of imperialism.
Thomas_Drake1	679165777577172992	2015-12-22T05:05:14	My goal is to help people understand what's going on around us. A true truism:Those who fail to understand the past are doomed to repeat it.
Thomas_Drake1	679164845732831232	2015-12-22T05:01:32	So I want to use this twitter account to experiment. I am going to start teaching a twitter class in American history.
Thomas_Drake1	679164150862454784	2015-12-22T04:58:46	Without understanding recent U.S. history in the Middle East, Americans keep panicking over terrorism, and fall for warmongers.
Thomas_Drake1	679163370751311872	2015-12-22T04:55:40	Without understanding the historical context of today's events, Americans fall into fits of fear and panic, and turn to demagogues.
Thomas_Drake1	679162369809993728	2015-12-22T04:51:41	Without any knowledge of their past, Americans can't properly understand current events. They have no context.
Thomas_Drake1	679162036119576580	2015-12-22T04:50:22	I've spent a lifetime as a journalist. But I now realize that journalism has less impact today because Americans don't know history.
Thomas_Drake1	678764171949957124	2015-12-21T02:29:24	John Adams becomes the first president to be an enemy of press freedom in America.
Thomas_Drake1	678763794852638721	2015-12-21T02:27:54	After the acts become law, authors, journalists and dissidents are thrown into prison by the Adams Administration.
Thomas_Drake1	678763311589163008	2015-12-21T02:25:58	Sound like current events? It's actually 1798, and Congress passes the Alien and Sedition Acts.
Thomas_Drake1	678762399395160064	2015-12-21T02:22:21	Congress also wants to criminalize making false statements critical of the government, boosting national security in an undeclared war.
Thomas_Drake1	679336994175086593	2015-12-22T16:25:35	Journalists today are harming the public debate by writing and broadcasting stories with so little understanding of terrorism.
Thomas_Drake1	679335785598963713	2015-12-22T16:20:47	Fear-mongering, hype and hysteria about terrorism dominate the media today. The press coverage is worse than anything I've seen since 9/11.
Thomas_Drake1	677502844682006528	2015-12-17T14:57:20	This AfghanProverb is said with contempt when a person blindly follows orders from someone else's puppet. 
Thomas_Drake1	679522022817280003	2015-12-23T04:40:49	I took a break from twitter earlier this year. I decided to get back on, and discovered that someone had taken my original user name.
Thomas_Drake1	679883856464449537	2015-12-24T04:38:37	"The miller had a dog; his dog had a dog."   That Afghan proverb is a great description of American journalism today.

Thomas_Drake1	681593314148282370	2015-12-28T21:51:24	Bush said he wanted to get rid of Saddam. In the process, he overturned the social structure of Iraq. We are living with the consequences.
Thomas_Drake1	681589812126691330	2015-12-28T21:37:29	The US invasion broke Iraq, we installed a Shia government, and disenfranchised Sunnis.An endless Sunni insurgency is the result.
Thomas_Drake1	681588791124078592	2015-12-28T21:33:25	In 2003, Gen. David Petraeus, commanding the 101st Airborne Div. in Mosul, asks "tell me how this ends." Today, Mosul is controlled by ISIS.
Thomas_Drake1	681583011733831681	2015-12-28T21:10:27	Does the media wonder why we keep fighting for the same towns in Iraq over and over again? Or is that too much history for them to handle?
