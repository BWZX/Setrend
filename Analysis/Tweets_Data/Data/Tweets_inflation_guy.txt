inflation_guy	725871558087069696	2016-04-29T02:17:20	MorrisvilleL that's what I thought you meant. Everything is appointment only to Goldman unless they're going your way. Try BNP.
inflation_guy	725870596333121537	2016-04-29T02:13:30	MorrisvilleL p.s. The squid?
inflation_guy	725869346346684416	2016-04-29T02:08:32	MorrisvilleL they were pretty liquid for a while but with Dodd-frank everything harder. Tends to be one way. But not impossible.

inflation_guy	720612386219012096	2016-04-14T13:59:15	wilevine econhedge very different weights. Not that simple! But you may be right. I don't pay much attention to core PCE.

inflation_guy	720611042976346114	2016-04-14T13:53:55	YamesAlexander georgepearkes because growth has nothing to do with inflation. Low correlation and. I causation.
inflation_guy	720610851330195456	2016-04-14T13:53:09	wilevine econhedge that's why it will be around 0.1 but remember most categories are over 3% y/y. Flat will be hard.
inflation_guy	720610540003831808	2016-04-14T13:51:55	econhedge yeah they ain't hitting that forecast
inflation_guy	720601361830842368	2016-04-14T13:15:27	econhedge if one month of core PCE makes her right OR wrong then we have the wrong question!
inflation_guy	720601065461301248	2016-04-14T13:14:16	YamesAlexander georgepearkes trimmed mean and median are much better estimates of central tendency than core.

inflation_guy	720596705276796928	2016-04-14T12:56:57	lebas_janney true of all economic indicators and experiments in all sciences! It's the nature of estimation

inflation_guy	720595419168915456	2016-04-14T12:51:50	PPI and CPI don't have much overlap, or we would rely more on the earlier PPI. So hard to read much.
inflation_guy	720595209067827202	2016-04-14T12:51:00	In Medical: drugs 2.49% v 2.34%. Prof svcs 2.27% vs 2.54%. hospital 4.33% v 4.90%. Insuance 6.20% v 5.97%. Similar read to PPI.
inflation_guy	720594830359994368	2016-04-14T12:49:30	in housing: Primary rents 3.66% vs 3.68%; OER 3.12% vs 3.16%. lodging away from home 2.27% v 4.19%. so rise in housing was HH energy.
inflation_guy	720594353933131778	2016-04-14T12:47:36	so could be seasonal...but we will have to wait to know for sure. weird, anyway.
inflation_guy	720594276221116416	2016-04-14T12:47:18	but WOMENS outerwear 5.5% from 3.2%; suits &amp; separates +0.2% from -0.3%. Dresses down though, -6.3% from -4.3%.
inflation_guy	720593966626967552	2016-04-14T12:46:04	within apparel: Mens suits/sportcoats/outerwear -7.6% from -4.6%. Mens furnishings -1.2% from +2.2%. Mens pants/shorts -5.8% from +2.4%
inflation_guy	720593485456347136	2016-04-14T12:44:09	ok - apparel -0.64% from +0.89% y/y. medical care 3.29% from 3.50%. housing up small, recreation, education/comm, other all up small.
inflation_guy	720592755282599936	2016-04-14T12:41:15	my suspicion: we may be able to lean more to the "apparel was seasonal" hypothesis but jury is out on medical care normalization.
inflation_guy	720592421399171073	2016-04-14T12:39:55	have to remember these are experiments - underlying inflation rate not knowable so we can only reject hypotheses.
inflation_guy	720592174706991104	2016-04-14T12:38:57	while i'm waiting for more detail...this CPI doesn't mean it's done going up; just that we can't reject the hypothesis that it's not.
inflation_guy	720591314761424896	2016-04-14T12:35:32	core services slipped to 3.0% from 3.1%; core goods dropped to -0.4% from +0.1%
inflation_guy	720590934115807232	2016-04-14T12:34:01	first glance - medical care y/y slipped, and apparel y/y plunged. getting more detail
inflation_guy	720590320405258240	2016-04-14T12:31:34	even weaker than that...+0.07%, 2.20% exactly y/y on core. That's a really big surprise.
inflation_guy	720590036589273089	2016-04-14T12:30:27	Weak CPI number! 0.1%/0.1% and y/y core slipped to 2.2%!
inflation_guy	720589431313403904	2016-04-14T12:28:02	Is apparel the canary in the coal mine from recent jumps? And is CPI or PPI right about medical care? The latter has been softer.
inflation_guy	720589245438631936	2016-04-14T12:27:18	OK, 4 minutes until CPI. If I had to guess what a theme, I would say the question of whether apparel and medical care trends continue.

inflation_guy	715243162986528770	2016-03-30T18:23:53	macroinsightgrp we have 2 models. lag of home prices suggests leveling out but no decline. Real-income model suggests steady rise.
inflation_guy	715231910591602688	2016-03-30T17:39:10	macroinsightgrp a bit surprising considering the perkiness of med care in CPI. But that perkiness will eventually show thru in PCE.

inflation_guy	713797894994792448	2016-03-26T18:40:54	emiliomanfred correction for this level of nom rates. So some amt of higher nom rates and higher bei is to be expected.
inflation_guy	713797488851943424	2016-03-26T18:39:17	emiliomanfred yes, agree with that. Long bei always totally overreact to energy moves. Vy large opportunity! We have 10y bei ~90bp cheap
inflation_guy	713784952861667328	2016-03-26T17:49:28	emiliomanfred it's all carry. If the short end nominal doesn't move much, changes in expected infl (energy!) must show up in real rate

inflation_guy	710194042882146305	2016-03-16T20:00:29	notayesmansecon econhedge IanShepherdson here is the context - SA apparel. i was worried in 2012! 
inflation_guy	710193414529224704	2016-03-16T19:57:59	MSkotnicki me too, but there's nothing monetary policy can do to help growth (in the absence of significant money illusion)
inflation_guy	710178493120782336	2016-03-16T18:58:41	econhedge Probably means medical returning to the old trend. Shelter is pretty solid. I suspect she'll be skeptical while it suits her.

inflation_guy	710176906059096066	2016-03-16T18:52:23	Unless she means 11.
inflation_guy	710176838048415744	2016-03-16T18:52:07	Yellen: "Our inflation goal is symmetric." I guess that means 8.

inflation_guy	710174381717250048	2016-03-16T18:42:21	Fed is evidently using novel methods of econ forecasting. Yellen looking more &amp; more like this person. 
inflation_guy	710173313641914368	2016-03-16T18:38:07	Yellen expects 2% inflation for next 2-3 years. Market pricing 1.58%, and ~1.0% core.
inflation_guy	710172898510704640	2016-03-16T18:36:28	MSkotnicki They eased and kept sharply negative real rates for 7 years, leading to weak growth. And 25-50bps will cause recession?
inflation_guy	710171062533812228	2016-03-16T18:29:10	Stocks love it again! B/c as the 1970s showed us, stocks do great when the Fed ignores inflation. sarcasm

inflation_guy	710167426969812992	2016-03-16T18:14:43	MSkotnicki probably true but not in their control. Lower rates will keep budget interest costs down though. Real mess coming...
inflation_guy	710166904019820544	2016-03-16T18:12:38	airdummer As always. But never in doubt!
inflation_guy	710165982044680192	2016-03-16T18:08:59	Stocks love this. Gold loves this more.
inflation_guy	710165310075236353	2016-03-16T18:06:18	Expected, and yet simultaneously inexplicable.
inflation_guy	710165256153260032	2016-03-16T18:06:05	Infl is already at or above FOMC target, measured by core or median CPI (adj for spread to PCE); PCE will be there imminently.
inflation_guy	710164893362757633	2016-03-16T18:04:39	Oddly the statement continues to focus on headline inflation, which everyone knows is not the target variable.
inflation_guy	710164679906222080	2016-03-16T18:03:48	One dissent in favor of immediate rate hike. Irrelevant. Only one vote on the FOMC matters.
inflation_guy	710164338531811328	2016-03-16T18:02:27	Fed LOWERS expected PCE inflation, and lowers expected funds rate. Any question about whether they care more about growth or infl?
inflation_guy	710129501259243521	2016-03-16T15:44:01	Cleveland Fed's Median CPI +0.23%, y/y to 2.43%. Slightly higher than my back-of-envelope calculation of 0.22%.
inflation_guy	710121258957021184	2016-03-16T15:11:16	YamesAlexander go look at the chart (p. 35 of my book) and we can take the discussion offline.
inflation_guy	710120754344562688	2016-03-16T15:09:15	YamesAlexander nope, as Friedman wrote the causality, so the regressions work. Lower rates increase demand for real cash balances.
inflation_guy	710119539950878722	2016-03-16T15:04:26	YamesAlexander V collapses because interest rates fall. Correlation between 5y rates and V is 0.9.
inflation_guy	710118002029629440	2016-03-16T14:58:19	YamesAlexander increasing M only affects Q in presence of money illusion; most evidence suggests there is very little money illusion.
inflation_guy	710117780830490624	2016-03-16T14:57:26	YamesAlexander you're relying on MV=PQ, but Q is mostly endogenous. Else, there would be a correlation betw M growth and Q.
inflation_guy	710116449495420929	2016-03-16T14:52:09	YamesAlexander but the fed has no power over output, either real or nominal. They can only affect prices.
inflation_guy	710114031504388096	2016-03-16T14:42:33	YamesAlexander (3) Best long-run growth requires low and stable inflation and thus low inflationary frictions.
inflation_guy	710113912021192705	2016-03-16T14:42:04	YamesAlexander (2) fed policy tools are effective at restraining inflation (less so now tho), horrible at affeecting growth.
inflation_guy	710113647377440768	2016-03-16T14:41:01	YamesAlexander 3 answers. (1) raising rates unlikely to hurt economy in environment of abundant liquidity.
inflation_guy	710113229549260801	2016-03-16T14:39:21	econhedge IanShepherdson yes although medical is more important. It's what drove core down and the one-off impacts are ebbing.
inflation_guy	710108033309929472	2016-03-16T14:18:42	econhedge IanShepherdson also I will note no canary is needed. Median inflation has been &gt;2% for years.
inflation_guy	710107848236253185	2016-03-16T14:17:58	econhedge IanShepherdson maybe and I thought so yrs ago when apparel rose after years of deflation. But it is so $-sensitive now.
inflation_guy	710107183753592832	2016-03-16T14:15:20	CanucksRule247 that they waited too long to unwind "emergency" stimulus.
inflation_guy	710105495583981569	2016-03-16T14:08:37	CanucksRule247 killing growth. Most dovish fed in history. But the picture is blindingly obvious now.
inflation_guy	710105154943635456	2016-03-16T14:07:16	dennismarta core probably over 3% by then. In any event raising rates w/o shrinking balance sheet won't do much.
inflation_guy	710104856065916928	2016-03-16T14:06:05	econhedge b2b apparel prints are surprising given strength of dollar. Probably not near-term sustainable.

inflation_guy	710095085753475072	2016-03-16T13:27:16	blakeyantis in 140 chars? Keynes was wrong. Money, not growth, causes inflation. Read my book (or blog) for longer answer! :-)
inflation_guy	710091518502150148	2016-03-16T13:13:05	Distribution of price changes. You can be forgiven for seeing this as giving the Fed the finger. 
inflation_guy	710091358657183749	2016-03-16T13:12:27	CanucksRule247 long end should suffer more, unless you think Fed is suddenly hawkish. Intermediates probably worst off.
inflation_guy	710090514058575872	2016-03-16T13:09:06	The only way this is good news is if you recently wrote a book on inflation. Which, as it turns out, I did: 
inflation_guy	710090165897859072	2016-03-16T13:07:43	...but some observers like to spin "rising inflation" as "sign of robust growth." Nope. See "1970s" in your encyclopedia.
inflation_guy	710090024772096000	2016-03-16T13:07:09	Stocks are doing tremendously well with this, only -9 points or so S&amp;P futures. This is awful news for equities.
inflation_guy	710089409249583104	2016-03-16T13:04:42	Like I said, thin gruel. There can be no doubt whatsoever that deflation risks are zero for the foreseeable future.
inflation_guy	710089059700510720	2016-03-16T13:03:19	Also, NEXT month we roll off an 0.21% from the y/y figure. So the hurdle will be higher for an uptick in core CPI.
inflation_guy	710088821312987136	2016-03-16T13:02:22	The good news is pretty thin gruel. Median CPI should be +0.22% or so, keeping y/y around 2.42%. At least it isn't running away yet.
inflation_guy	710087605505933312	2016-03-16T12:57:32	U-G-L-Y CPI ain't got no alibi. It's ugly (woot! woot!) it's ugly.
inflation_guy	710087396650586112	2016-03-16T12:56:42	And remember, Medical care gets a HIGHER WEIGHT in the Fed's preferred measure, core PCE.
inflation_guy	710087319932563456	2016-03-16T12:56:24	Med care is ~10% of core, so that 50bp jump is 0.05% on core.
inflation_guy	710086946039709697	2016-03-16T12:54:55	Drugs 2.34% from 2.21%. Professional svcs 2.54% from 2.08%. Hospital svcs 4.90% from 4.32%. Health insurance 5.97% from 4.76%. Ouch.
inflation_guy	710086861344120832	2016-03-16T12:54:35	Medical care: 3.50% from 3.00%. Yep.
inflation_guy	710086613355913216	2016-03-16T12:53:36	Apparel had big jump in y/y rate to 0.89% from -0.53%, but again Apparel as a whole is 3% of headline, 4% of core.
inflation_guy	710086399383511041	2016-03-16T12:52:45	Lodging away from home 4.19% vs 2.67%, but that's a small piece of CPI (&lt;1%)
inflation_guy	710086270303784960	2016-03-16T12:52:14	Housing: 2.12% from 2.10%. Primary rents (3.68% from 3.71%) and OER (unch at 3.16%) are NOT the drivers of the core jump.
inflation_guy	710085988962402304	2016-03-16T12:51:07	first positive y/y in core goods in two years.
inflation_guy	710085904610762752	2016-03-16T12:50:47	i have got to put this database on a faster computer. OK, core services 3.1% from 3% and core goods +0.1% from -0.1%.
inflation_guy	710084536860844032	2016-03-16T12:45:20	Arguments for waiting another meeting before raising rates are very thin. 
inflation_guy	710084414777204737	2016-03-16T12:44:51	while I wait for my sheets to calculate, let me stress this is not meaningless for the FOMC meeting today.
inflation_guy	710083649111203841	2016-03-16T12:41:49	_FrontierMan flyalex666 Not clear it won't. The inflation of the 1970s did. But my argument is with the post-crisis QE.
inflation_guy	710083070565728256	2016-03-16T12:39:31	core cpi. What, me worry? 
inflation_guy	710082159101538304	2016-03-16T12:35:54	Core consumer price inflation ex-shelter really accelerating: was 1.6% year over year in February 
inflation_guy	710082251338424320	2016-03-16T12:36:16	I should say 4 years and $2 trillion overdue.
inflation_guy	710081995326496768	2016-03-16T12:35:15	I said 2.33%, Actually 2.34%. We were VERY close to printing 2.4% y/y &amp; setting off panic at the Fed. Which is abt 4 yrs overdue.
inflation_guy	710081657764712448	2016-03-16T12:33:54	So back to back months we've had 0.29% and 0.28%. I hate to say I told you so but...
inflation_guy	710081437463154688	2016-03-16T12:33:02	Ouch, seems like a big jump in y/y Medical Care, waiting for the breakdown. If so, that makes core PCE jump even more (again).
inflation_guy	710080897253507072	2016-03-16T12:30:53	whoopsie, core CPI +0.3%. Actually 0.28%, puts y/y at 2.34%. Yayy, a new post-crisis record!
inflation_guy	710078547168247808	2016-03-16T12:21:32	Ten minutes to CPI and time for 1 more coffee and a commercial message: please buy my new book! 
inflation_guy	710077414584487936	2016-03-16T12:17:02	Highest core print since the crisis was 2.32% in 2012. We have a shot of exceeding that today with a robust print.
inflation_guy	710076804619444226	2016-03-16T12:14:37	Second: If we get exactly 0.2% core, then y/y will round higher to 2.3%. Third: if we get exactly 0.3%, y/y core will round to 2.4%.
inflation_guy	710076637170290688	2016-03-16T12:13:57	Three notes before CPI prints in 17 minutes: First, the market is expecting a "soft" 0.2% core (something like 0.16%, rounding up)
inflation_guy	710076348518244353	2016-03-16T12:12:48	Good morning and welcome to another wonderful CPI day!

inflation_guy	705203387495747584	2016-03-03T01:29:24	berhard_eric Your argument is we have to nominate him or else he will run anyway? Not clear who it would hurt more if he did.

inflation_guy	700849288889425921	2016-02-20T01:07:46	Note that airfares are considered core services, even though the chart clearly shows they should be energy services.

inflation_guy	700688899543330816	2016-02-19T14:30:26	T3_RM the reason there are no good choices is they made the wrong ones in 2010-2014.

inflation_guy	700688442162806785	2016-02-19T14:28:37	T3_RM it isn't ONLY coming from med care. That's just new. But they shouldn't raise rates - they should reduce their bal  sheet.
inflation_guy	700686475403403264	2016-02-19T14:20:48	I think March just went back on the table for the FOMC.
inflation_guy	700686217755672576	2016-02-19T14:19:47	Still very hard for the Fed to ignore the core CPI chart. And PCE will be worse, because it is heavier in medical care.
inflation_guy	700685962075103232	2016-02-19T14:18:46	Still the overall trend is clear: housing and now core ex-housing inflation are headed higher.
inflation_guy	700685839131656193	2016-02-19T14:18:16	Also interesting is that the diffusion indices didn't go wacky. So this number is not QUITE as bad as it seems at first blush.
inflation_guy	700685589155340288	2016-02-19T14:17:17	OK, good news is that it looks like median CPI ought to be about 0.18%ish, so y/y will inch back up to 2.5% but not jump to 2.6%.
inflation_guy	700683441143156736	2016-02-19T14:08:45	This is less and less just a housing phenomenon.

inflation_guy	700682922043568128	2016-02-19T14:06:41	Of interest - the fall in energy prices has reduced "food and energy" to 21% from 22.3%. So core is bigger.

inflation_guy	700674396025917440	2016-02-19T13:32:48	Next month, we drop off a +0.16% from last year so even a +0.20% print on core would push us to 2.3% in Feb.

inflation_guy	695601305738420226	2016-02-05T13:34:09	Given the mental framework the Fed uses, the high earnings figure and the 4.9% unemp rate increases odds of another hike.
inflation_guy	695601011893911552	2016-02-05T13:32:59	Avg hourly earnings 2.5% and prior month revised upward to 2.7%. 
inflation_guy	695600612155777024	2016-02-05T13:31:24	Employment number is a Jan number which should be ignored. BUT, were I so inclined I would note that Avg Hourly Earnings is climbing.

inflation_guy	690336411313045504	2016-01-22T00:53:20	CPI, Your Way 
inflation_guy	689842136695574528	2016-01-20T16:09:16	Man, I'm starting to get good at this. Median CPI officially: +0.147% m/m, 2.43% y/y.
inflation_guy	689833360668106752	2016-01-20T15:34:24	Thanks for all the follows today folks!
inflation_guy	689832803215605760	2016-01-20T15:32:11	Summary of My Post-CPI Tweets  
inflation_guy	689816754684588032	2016-01-20T14:28:25	Bottom line is that broad inflation is around 2.5%, but more than 40% of CPI is above 3% and rising.
inflation_guy	689816555182489600	2016-01-20T14:27:37	Median...fairly close call, looks like 0.147% on my back-of-envelope, which would make y/y median CPI drop to 2.43% from 2.46%.
inflation_guy	689813584612855812	2016-01-20T14:15:49	But at least inflation hasn't broadened FURTHER over the last few months. It's been around 42-47% inflating over 3%.
inflation_guy	689813462441185281	2016-01-20T14:15:20	Proportion of CPI that is inflating faster than 3% is at 42.7%. So main body is still between 3%-4% with long negative tails.
inflation_guy	689812645063581697	2016-01-20T14:12:05	They will still be higher than everyone on the Street, I am sure. Because they think growth matters a lot for inflation.
inflation_guy	689812478985920512	2016-01-20T14:11:25	...and less sure that interest rates will rise, pulling up money velocity. So, I will be pulling my forecasts for 2016 lower.
inflation_guy	689812230427262976	2016-01-20T14:10:26	Rents will continue to rise. And so median CPI should also. But I am less sure than I have been that the $ will stop strengthening.
inflation_guy	689811060803702784	2016-01-20T14:05:47	Rents are over 3% and rising. Food &amp; energy weak, core goods weak, core svcs ex-rents rising.
inflation_guy	689810530605862912	2016-01-20T14:03:41	So you can think of core CPI as (rents) + (core goods) + (core services ex-rents) + (food &amp; energy). Each roughly equal weight.
inflation_guy	689808964859600896	2016-01-20T13:57:27	Sorry that's core ex-shelter, not ex-housing.
inflation_guy	689808900393140225	2016-01-20T13:57:12	Core inflation ex-housing rose, 1.28% y/y by my calculation, highest since mid-2014. Hasn't been MUCH higher since 2012-13.
inflation_guy	689808358384275458	2016-01-20T13:55:03	The continued rally in the dollar probably means core goods will continue to drag on overall CPI. It's not a huge effect but it's there.
inflation_guy	689808015395012608	2016-01-20T13:53:41	MarcoMNYC again probably seasonal. Apparel has big price changes in December and hard to adjust well.
inflation_guy	689807798436302848	2016-01-20T13:52:49	Overall, core services remained at +2.9% y/y; core goods rose to -0.4% from -0.6%.
inflation_guy	689807659114086400	2016-01-20T13:52:16	In Transp, Motor Fuel did better on base effects (only -19.5% y/y!) but insurance, repair, and new cars/trucks were all up.
inflation_guy	689807277952491520	2016-01-20T13:50:45	Household Energy was also lower. So there you have it - the rent and implied rents continue to go up; the cost of piped gas e.g. not.
inflation_guy	689807049589395456	2016-01-20T13:49:51	Lodging Away from Home (small category) dropped to 1.88% from 2.78% y/y. Again, smacks of bad seasonal adjustment.
inflation_guy	689806890675671040	2016-01-20T13:49:13	Those are the pendulous categories, between them almost half of core CPI, that matter. And they keep going up.
inflation_guy	689806755900039168	2016-01-20T13:48:41	In Housing, Primary Rents and OER both accelerated, which is what matters. Primaries 3.68% from 3.64%; OER 3.14% from 3.08%.
inflation_guy	689806600912179200	2016-01-20T13:48:04	That smacks of a seasonal maladjustment. But it's only 1.7% of the basket.
inflation_guy	689806513288933376	2016-01-20T13:47:43	In Medical Care (which is only 7.7% of CPI but high-angst for people), big drop in medicinal drugs to 1.66% from 2.68%.
inflation_guy	689806322943049728	2016-01-20T13:46:58	OK, in big categories Housing and Medical care decelerated while Apparel, Transp, and Educ/communication accelerated.
inflation_guy	689803273377824768	2016-01-20T13:34:50	Next mo we compare to +0.18% in Jan 2015 (on core), so uptick to 2.2% will be more difficult. But core should converge with median.
inflation_guy	689802906451574786	2016-01-20T13:33:23	y/y core is 2.09% to 2 decimals. I really thought it would go to 2.2% this month, but like I said, Dec is wacky.
inflation_guy	689802709881507840	2016-01-20T13:32:36	Core month/month was 0.13% to 2 decimal places, and forecasters were really looking for 0.18%ish, so not horrible miss.
inflation_guy	689802319425314816	2016-01-20T13:31:03	OK, +0.1% on core a bit weaker than expected, but y/y still rose to 2.1%.  y/y headline to 0.7%, though I don't care about headline.
inflation_guy	689800888844750848	2016-01-20T13:25:22	Headline CPI will also rise, y/y, simply because of base effects. Don't think the Fed didn't know this when they tightened!
inflation_guy	689800531250905089	2016-01-20T13:23:57	But Dec CPI is always weird, like many Dec numbers. It's the only month that has a strong seasonal effect on prices (in the US).
inflation_guy	689800256276537344	2016-01-20T13:22:51	OK, remember this morning we're dropping off some lousy numbers so core should rise to 2.1% just on base effects.
inflation_guy	689798570363469824	2016-01-20T13:16:09	So I guess the good news this morning is that the market has bigger worries than CPI. Wait, is that good news?
