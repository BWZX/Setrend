jelani9	717913152478965760	2016-04-07T03:13:28	Most of those candidates being at least fairly reliable advocates for African American interests. So why vote for Jackson &amp; Obama?

jelani9	714466464523296768	2016-03-28T14:57:33	Again: call me. I sent you the digits. Abt_Thomas
jelani9	714466113795567616	2016-03-28T14:56:10	The implication is that we're not citizens. Our problems are not a national concern. They're a racial concerns that WE should fix.
jelani9	714465285487640580	2016-03-28T14:52:52	This is EXACTLY the point. White people are never asked what they're doing to stop violence in their community.

jelani9	714461536757145600	2016-03-28T14:37:59	It only furthers the cause of injustice to focus not upon the existence of racism but to damn people for failing to outmaneuver it.
jelani9	714460741215076353	2016-03-28T14:34:49	WE witness and grieve the impact of this violence. And have never needed "researchers" to explain the moral implications of black death.

jelani9	714459850227466240	2016-03-28T14:31:16	The lineage of black history can be summed up as a struggle to hold onto the value of our lives. No matter who threatened them.
jelani9	714459584887439362	2016-03-28T14:30:13	Because if you shed your omniscience and asked questions or read the history you'd know better than to think we need your reminding.

jelani9	683771625473478657	2016-01-03T22:07:14	In America rich people tend not to conspire against and destroy other rich people for the sin of hating poor people. Put the cape down.
jelani9	683771451158228993	2016-01-03T22:06:32	Put down the cape. Bill Cosby is not Emmitt Till or Medgar Evers.
jelani9	683771149675839490	2016-01-03T22:05:20	Because we mistook Cosby's misanthropy for "truth-telling," we can be shocked by the idea that he hates and violates women.
jelani9	683770824562728960	2016-01-03T22:04:03	This is because we believe dignity to be a commodity and only the well-funded deserve it automatically.

jelani9	683770049233088513	2016-01-03T22:00:58	We insist upon seeing Cosby's philanthropy and his sexual violence as contradictory. But what if the former facilitated the latter?

jelani9	683765289926930432	2016-01-03T21:42:03	It should be clear at this point that Cosby's philanthropy was often self interested, serving to neutralize potential critics.
