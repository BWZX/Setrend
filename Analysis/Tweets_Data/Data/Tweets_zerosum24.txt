zerosum24	724743264335749120	2016-04-25T23:33:53	MrZorro29 It's a hard skill to learn, I didn't learn it overnight personally. But I'm telling you once you stop caring it will help.

zerosum24	724734673490989056	2016-04-25T22:59:45	MrZorro29 very true, but once you learn from them and do your best not to repeat you're a lot closer to success!
