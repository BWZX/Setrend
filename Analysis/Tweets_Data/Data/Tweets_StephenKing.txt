StephenKing	697817701801181184	2016-02-11T16:21:19	Okay, so plenty of Ohio novels. Also plenty of corn.
StephenKing	697618979242774528	2016-02-11T03:11:40	I mean, there's PARADISE FALLS, by Don Robertson, but beyond that...?
StephenKing	697618848724467712	2016-02-11T03:11:09	Serious question here: Other than the one about Winesburg, by Sherwood Anderson, has anyone ever written a great novel about Ohio?
StephenKing	696895789134647296	2016-02-09T03:17:58	KristenGBaldwin Only a veteran of REVENGE would have such insight. Bwa-haha
StephenKing	696868259950411776	2016-02-09T01:28:35	My favorite vintage paperback cover line: "Liz hit the gutter...AND BOUNCED LOWER!"
StephenKing	695730102747926528	2016-02-05T22:05:57	Molly, aka the Thing of Evil, plays the game her way: first you score, then you eat the ball. 
StephenKing	695408328113938438	2016-02-05T00:47:20	JANE GOT A GUN: A really good Western. Made me think of HOMBRE, with Paul Newman.
StephenKing	695009374473953281	2016-02-03T22:22:02	The only thing I missed in CITY ON FIRE was mention of NYC's proto-punk group, The Fugs. I'd love to see a bio movie of those guys.
StephenKing	694638696025473025	2016-02-02T21:49:05	You know, people, calling six coin flips in a row is far from impossible. It's 50/50 every time.
StephenKing	694638567302283264	2016-02-02T21:48:34	Approaching 1,000 tweets, I see. Must ration myself. Such a temptation to tweet about politics. You know, blah-blah-blah.
StephenKing	694638320857530369	2016-02-02T21:47:36	Nice interview with me in . A bit old, but still good. I actually sound articulate for a change.
StephenKing	693994975479070720	2016-02-01T03:11:10	Breznican Oh, snap!
StephenKing	693994876703219712	2016-02-01T03:10:47	Kliffoth_ It's like a great French novel...only, like, set in America and written by an American.
StephenKing	693994619206569985	2016-02-01T03:09:45	mctrademarc Yeah, any book 900 pages long, someone always says "It needed an editor." I have personal experience. You want short, watch TV.
StephenKing	693994162622959616	2016-02-01T03:07:56	FkMyTweets666 Yes. Also THE TWELVE. Looking forward to CITY OF MIRRORS, the final volume in the trilogy.
StephenKing	693973365036564480	2016-02-01T01:45:18	Breznican This quacks me up.
StephenKing	693973143078191104	2016-02-01T01:44:25	CITY ON FIRE, by Garth Risk Hallberg: Dickensian, massively  entertaining, as close to a great American novel as this century has produced.
StephenKing	693935458372468736	2016-01-31T23:14:40	A little tune you won't hear at any Cruz rallies, or at those of He Who Must Not Be Named.

StephenKing	690225020908498945	2016-01-21T17:30:43	Voters beware: When you vote in right-wingers who believe government is the problem, what you get is--ta-da--Flint, Michigan.
StephenKing	690003683170451457	2016-01-21T02:51:12	The thing she's chewing in the picture is the remains of an insurance salesman's right toe.
StephenKing	690003241048883200	2016-01-21T02:49:26	The library ladies gave Molly, aka the Thing of Evil, a new bed. She has decided not to hurt them. 
StephenKing	690002815138275328	2016-01-21T02:47:45	Great big fun with John Grisham last night in Bradenton, FL. Thanks to everyone who came. Raised $200,000 for the library and had a blast.

StephenKing	689251500443303936	2016-01-19T01:02:18	I keep thinking about the characters on SONS OF ANARCHY. And missing them.
StephenKing	689250818009247744	2016-01-19T00:59:35	pattonoswalt Don't even think it!
StephenKing	689250621749215232	2016-01-19T00:58:48	I'm in the Academy, but not eligible to nominate actors. Otherwise I would have tabbed Idris Elba and Michael B. Jordan. Great performances.
StephenKing	689249845454868480	2016-01-19T00:55:43	So sorry to hear about the passing of Glenn Frey. Great songwriter, great musician, great talent.
StephenKing	687715781560393728	2016-01-14T19:19:54	So sorry about the passing of Alan Rickman. Too young, too young.
StephenKing	687431230556614657	2016-01-14T00:29:11	Anyway, good luck. If you win, buy books. Lots of books. You can read them on your new yacht. Or while flying on your Gulfstream.
StephenKing	687430189366808576	2016-01-14T00:25:03	Powerball: Zillions of dollars generated by teeny-tiny slips of paper. American capitalism at its best.

StephenKing	686019285886603264	2016-01-10T02:58:38	What if dead people started tweeting? That would be really scary. Think about it. Alone. With the lights out.
StephenKing	686005234175315968	2016-01-10T02:02:47	Terrific chemistry between the two main characters.

StephenKing	685547636468797440	2016-01-08T19:44:28	One must admit LePage has elevated assholery to a level far past the extraordinary and into a rarified sphere that might be termed divine.
StephenKing	685547185857933312	2016-01-08T19:42:40	donwinslow Go with your bad self.
StephenKing	685544509149581312	2016-01-08T19:32:02	Paul LePage: "D-Money, Smoothie, and Shifty come up to Maine &amp; impregnate white girls." Once more showing his sensitivity and intelligence.
StephenKing	684433611794284544	2016-01-05T17:57:43	God bless President Obama for saying no one wants to repeal the 2nd Amendment, just put small measures in place to lessen the carnage.
StephenKing	684119240283144193	2016-01-04T21:08:31	You rarely get a cover that sums up how you felt and what you imagined when you wrote a book. This one does it.
