danobrien20	703693296388980736	2016-02-27T21:28:50	SeamusConboy Only @AlexWhiteTD I think, which is a real pity as he is able and an effective minister JohnOBrennan2
danobrien20	703690436330840064	2016-02-27T21:17:28	JohnOBrennan2 exactly. the current cabinet could in theory remain in office for another five years if new Taoiseach is not elected
danobrien20	703689193797644294	2016-02-27T21:12:32	Constitution foresees no power vacuum. Enda Kenny remains as Taoiseach until another one is elected. All ministers remain in office too.
danobrien20	703687468877484032	2016-02-27T21:05:41	jdoflaherty No. Here is article 13.2

danobrien20	703678381162930180	2016-02-27T20:29:34	The constitution puts no time limit on electing a Taoiseach. In theory the full five year Dail term could pass with a caretaker government.
