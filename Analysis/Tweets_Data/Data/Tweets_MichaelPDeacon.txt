MichaelPDeacon	711959957038563328	2016-03-21T16:57:35	steveguyettmil2 Amazing
MichaelPDeacon	711958759552249856	2016-03-21T16:52:50	Corbyn obsesses about tedious process - no show of Osborne etc which matters little to votes. Ignores IDS gift. Labour MPs horrified.
MichaelPDeacon	711958124803059712	2016-03-21T16:50:19	Seems Jeremy Corbyn never mentioned IDS once in his response to the PM's statement. Bold.

MichaelPDeacon	711957783269285891	2016-03-21T16:48:57	Yesterday I wrote a sketch suggesting that Labour should make IDS their leader. At the time, it was meant as a joke

MichaelPDeacon	711955045923864577	2016-03-21T16:38:05	Does Jeremy Corbyn actually know Iain Duncan Smith has resigned? Did no one in his prep team think to check?
MichaelPDeacon	711952133650776064	2016-03-21T16:26:30	Corbyn, yet again, opens his response to the PM with a moan about Parliamentary process. The issues that really matter.
MichaelPDeacon	711952132077973504	2016-03-21T16:26:30	Cameron spends 30 seconds saying IDS did a great job as minister - and three minutes saying he's full of rubbish
MichaelPDeacon	711949739152035840	2016-03-21T16:16:59	Think that UQ was a mistake by Labour. Safe-hands Gauke united the Tory benches and warmed them up for Cameron.
