dsquareddigest	720173183224127489	2016-04-13T08:54:01	LadyFOHF but it's such an obvious conflict that I'm amazed that he didn't ever think "this could look a bit dodge, better call compliance"

dsquareddigest	713451048892047360	2016-03-25T19:42:39	t0nyyates darioperkins think it's more a reflection of the fact that it's actually very difficult to crash a big bank except by liquidity

dsquareddigest	713449234532536322	2016-03-25T19:35:27	t0nyyates darioperkins ...and not go below the minimum. Which is obviously mathematically impossible at anything less than 100%
dsquareddigest	713449009894072320	2016-03-25T19:34:33	t0nyyates darioperkins my worry is that people want to set the minimum capital req at a level such that banks could go through a crisis...
dsquareddigest	713447895433932800	2016-03-25T19:30:08	t0nyyates darioperkins the crisis was very much driven by Mervyn's own failure to act decisively on liquidity support.
dsquareddigest	713447666039001091	2016-03-25T19:29:13	t0nyyates darioperkins also needs to be emphasized though that no big UK bank took losses greater than capital in 08.
dsquareddigest	713447345925578752	2016-03-25T19:27:57	t0nyyates darioperkins and the changes to bail-in mean that arguably ~50% of liabilities are such that you don't *have* to pay back...
dsquareddigest	713447096469299200	2016-03-25T19:26:57	t0nyyates darioperkins right. As it happens that now actually is about 2.5x what it was pre-08
dsquareddigest	713446923420712961	2016-03-25T19:26:16	t0nyyates darioperkins agree. What we should have done but unaccountably didn't, is respect the planned 8 year phase in period
dsquareddigest	713446701940482048	2016-03-25T19:25:23	t0nyyates darioperkins do you mean the buffer or the requirement itself sorry; the buffer is another 2-6pp on top of the 10
dsquareddigest	713445590240202753	2016-03-25T19:20:58	RichardA this really does read like "I don't care and it shows". There's no actual problem/solution analysis, just "I want to do something"
dsquareddigest	713444925464055808	2016-03-25T19:18:20	t0nyyates darioperkins boringly, I think where we are now is about right. 10pp of equity, another 5 of CoCo &amp; cyclical management directly

dsquareddigest	713441361329004544	2016-03-25T19:04:10	t0nyyates JohnHCochrane yeah. 2pp of capital ratio won't have material incentive effects but it's a lot of money to absorb losses
dsquareddigest	713440813141856256	2016-03-25T19:01:59	darioperkins t0nyyates they were wrong. If that money wasn't in the provision it would have gone in dividends
dsquareddigest	713440515572830208	2016-03-25T19:00:48	t0nyyates JohnHCochrane yes. Been a bunch of work on this at Basel and NCBs. Just not big enough to be tool of cyclical policy.

dsquareddigest	707930229940076544	2016-03-10T14:04:54	Yes good point EburyChat16. TLTRO2 is actually quite a bit more bank-favourable than the first run.

dsquareddigest	707926545969586177	2016-03-10T13:50:15	I think they're still in their comfort zone though - TLTRO and securities purchases. The really radical stuff isn't here yet EburyChat16
dsquareddigest	707926275013419008	2016-03-10T13:49:11	OK, my view - clearly bullish near term for the banks, &amp; indicates that financing crunch had Draghi worried. EburyChat16

dsquareddigest	707924881535541248	2016-03-10T13:43:39	Yeah. Draghi needs to get Italian credit growth positive. That's the success or failure metric IMO EburyChat16 
dsquareddigest	707924421634293761	2016-03-10T13:41:49	I would say more of the same, but *much* more of the same EburyChat16

dsquareddigest	707924011498524672	2016-03-10T13:40:11	EburyChat16 TLTRO - up to 30% of your opening loan book. Refi rate as basis, getting cheaper the more you lend.
dsquareddigest	707923736033361921	2016-03-10T13:39:05	EburyChat16 should hardly need saying, but TLTRO2 blows away all those worries about Italian bank funding (if not profitability)

dsquareddigest	707921538838876160	2016-03-10T13:30:22	EburyChat16 I'd like to see more technical details on the TLTRO, but in principle it looks like a subsidy to offset the negative rate tax
