tcarmody	718682563125108736	2016-04-09T06:10:50	ryanchris Walt Simonson was a crazy motherfucker, they let him do whatever and it was beautiful
tcarmody	718681683239792640	2016-04-09T06:07:20	“He loved sports history, modernist writers, golden age hip hop, women with curly hair, surreal comedies, and underappreciated superheroes”
tcarmody	718680590267084805	2016-04-09T06:02:59	I probably spend too much time thinking about what makes Black Panther special
tcarmody	718680116197531648	2016-04-09T06:01:06	CharlesPulliam it’s true! Ramonda. One of the great characters around him.
tcarmody	718679644850024448	2016-04-09T05:59:14	CharlesPulliam the combination of it — Klaw, Vision, Ultron, etc. Something has to lead him out. Plus his stepmother is South African.
tcarmody	718679105227632641	2016-04-09T05:57:05	It's like that riff on Superman from the end of Kill Bill. T'Challa doesn't wear a costume. Those are his clothes.
tcarmody	718678654641954816	2016-04-09T05:55:18	T'Challa's problems are much older than Batman's. There's no Freudian wish-fulfillment psychosis. It's pure epic-tragic problems of power.
tcarmody	718678102218551297	2016-04-09T05:53:06	Like Batman, T'Challa is rich, brilliant, a peak athlete/fighter. Unlike him, he's actually a king. He has powers. He'll kill if he has to.
tcarmody	718677021115686912	2016-04-09T05:48:48	As I've said before, Black Panther is Batman without the bullshit.
tcarmody	718676881894207488	2016-04-09T05:48:15	One of the defining characteristics of Black Panther as a character is that he is above petty American superhero shit, except instrumentally
tcarmody	718675818973683712	2016-04-09T05:44:02	I'm also secretly hopeful T'Challa will switch sides, under Priest's principle that whatever you think he's doing, he's doing something else

tcarmody	718674356797382656	2016-04-09T05:38:13	But if it just gets brushed past, prepare for me to get mad. And you won't like me when I'm angry. And I won't be the only one.
tcarmody	718674035115212800	2016-04-09T05:36:56	Maybe in the full movie that will be a plot point: the destruction of an African city could be what gets T'Challa involved in all this
tcarmody	718673446046208000	2016-04-09T05:34:36	There's not even a supervillain, just two "heroes" destroying buildings and beating the crap out of each other while civilians scatter
tcarmody	718673270531342336	2016-04-09T05:33:54	In Age of Ultron, Johannesburg isn't even named (although it's recognizable), and the Iron Man-Hulk fight there is totally terrifying
tcarmody	718672851788767232	2016-04-09T05:32:14	So in the CIVIL WAR trailer Gen Ross lists NYC, DC, and Sokovia as examples of destroyed cities but not Johannesburg and this makes me mad

tcarmody	718635362676039681	2016-04-09T03:03:16	dooce anildash but in its DNA, it’s more like a 70s soul song than it is like 90s alt-rock.
tcarmody	718635203628023808	2016-04-09T03:02:38	dooce anildash you could remake “Last Goodbye” any kind of way. Change the tempo, arrangement, genders, anything.
tcarmody	718633532868988928	2016-04-09T02:56:00	anildash or shit, go full the other way, that could be a Barry White song
tcarmody	718633365860139008	2016-04-09T02:55:20	anildash would love a genderswapped take on “Last Goodbye”
tcarmody	718632711003512832	2016-04-09T02:52:44	anildash I mean “Lover, You Should’ve Come Over” is just SITTING there.

tcarmody	718631887519002624	2016-04-09T02:49:28	AGoldmund PJVogt 
tcarmody	718631698548789248	2016-04-09T02:48:43	AGoldmund PJVogt they’re both funny words that outstripped the technologies that were their namesake and continue to shift in meaning
tcarmody	718631155529084929	2016-04-09T02:46:33	AGoldmund or hey, there you go; YOU make a radio show, but PJVogt makes a podcast
tcarmody	718630769627897856	2016-04-09T02:45:01	AGoldmund in short, they both might be accurate, but they are not synonymous, same-connotation, interchangeable, even as much as “TV” is
tcarmody	718630519240527872	2016-04-09T02:44:01	AGoldmund so when you say “radio,” it seems like you’re trying to associate only with the strictly professional audio show producers
tcarmody	718630187789873154	2016-04-09T02:42:42	AGoldmund you also have the professionalization issue with podcasts. Some are huge, some are pro, some are small/indie, some are amateur
tcarmody	718629753276784640	2016-04-09T02:40:59	AGoldmund so in context, if you say, e.g., “I make a radio show,” like your bio, I think that’s totally accurate and I know what you mean
tcarmody	718629472216461312	2016-04-09T02:39:52	AGoldmund but radio can also be used in the sense of a broadcast or satellite station, or a receiver that plays those stations, etc.
tcarmody	718629328809037824	2016-04-09T02:39:18	AGoldmund so it’s radio, in the sense that it’s not television or text, and there are similar conventions, like episodes, etc.
tcarmody	718629133371248640	2016-04-09T02:38:31	AGoldmund let me put it this way: “radio” is definitely the larger, family-resemblance category. “Podcast” is a slightly spiky subset.
tcarmody	718628672996028417	2016-04-09T02:36:41	AGoldmund I actually think of podcasts and radio as just slightly more different than that. I can’t totally explain why.
tcarmody	718628293633777664	2016-04-09T02:35:11	AGoldmund I think of them as distinct, kind of in the way that I think of broadcast television &amp; digital video as distinct: subtle but real

tcarmody	718516630834257920	2016-04-08T19:11:28	agolis the distributed apps approach is a powerful one for FB already: Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, etc.
tcarmody	718516210191704064	2016-04-08T19:09:48	agolis word to that
tcarmody	718515933556420609	2016-04-08T19:08:42	agolis actually Google bought and bet big on a mobile operating system and it was one of the smartest things they ever did
tcarmody	718515779935858688	2016-04-08T19:08:05	agolis but once you commit to “make everything searchable” / “make everything social” — that’s tough to back away from
tcarmody	718409349404762112	2016-04-08T12:05:10	People sharing less personal stuff on Facebook:    Publishers seeing less Facebook traffic:  
tcarmody	718514285383720960	2016-04-08T19:02:09	agolis (plus, you know, smaller businesses like yours. Different problems but — not SO different)
tcarmody	718514147894431744	2016-04-08T19:01:36	agolis thinking through how a company like FB solves those problems is, I think, helpful for thinking about behavior on web as such
tcarmody	718513653197225984	2016-04-08T18:59:38	agolis it’s also where every new social network has been able to get more purchase, which I think people have missed
tcarmody	718513432409088007	2016-04-08T18:58:46	agolis agreed. And it’s a difficult problem to solve, especially without making your product too confusing.
tcarmody	718513167387779072	2016-04-08T18:57:43	agolis also: this is really, really hard. See also even Apple’s attempts to do things it isn’t very good at.
tcarmody	718512791154475008	2016-04-08T18:56:13	lifewinning “it solves everything *I* care about right now”
tcarmody	718511425543610368	2016-04-08T18:50:47	agolis another way to say the same thing: Facebook has been much better at forecasting and planning X years out than Yahoo was/is
tcarmody	718511205497892864	2016-04-08T18:49:55	agolis partly it’s that Yahoo was in perfect position to be Facebook and didn’t pull it off; Facebook’s moves so far have been much better

tcarmody	718297591721627648	2016-04-08T04:41:05	I’m pretty sure against the Warriors were picking up T’Wolves players up off the floor. Spurs, they’re not picking up off the floor.

tcarmody	718261036894265363	2016-04-08T02:15:50	erikmal Noah got 99 steals, otherwise he’s in the 700/400/100/100 club. Scored fewer points than Draymond. Fourth in MVP voting.

tcarmody	709566426005282816	2016-03-15T02:26:33	jbenton noahchestnut again, I’m thinking more of discoverability. When email newsletters started to emerge, I thought people’d forward ‘em
tcarmody	709565498023931904	2016-03-15T02:22:52	noahchestnut jbenton especially if you’re brand-new.  Maybe this is what Medium’s newsletter option is for. Or ought to be.
tcarmody	709565207471890432	2016-03-15T02:21:43	noahchestnut jbenton I think the idea of writing regularly on a beat is a good one. I just wonder whether email is best form for that.
tcarmody	709564450295177216	2016-03-15T02:18:42	jbenton it is very different to get on people’s radar vs. having a corpus of work. The old blogosphere was actually better at blending both
tcarmody	709564197319868417	2016-03-15T02:17:42	jbenton I guess I’m wondering — how do you get attention? Maybe you can point to the newsletter in APPLYING for a job
tcarmody	709563909162835968	2016-03-15T02:16:33	jbenton I actually can’t imagine *building an audience* through an email newsletter. Everything about the form works against that.

tcarmody	709537182785146881	2016-03-15T00:30:21	pierce vdepdel 2) I’d be tempted to say Netflix if I could also use FB Video, DailyMotion, Vimeo, Vevo, etc. But without them? YouTube.
tcarmody	709536969127288836	2016-03-15T00:29:30	pierce vdepdel here’s my reasoning: 1) in the absence of Netflix, YouTube replaces Netflix for syndication more easily than vice versa
