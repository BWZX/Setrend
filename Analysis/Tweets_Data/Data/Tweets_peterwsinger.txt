peterwsinger	721335460098883584	2016-04-16T13:52:30	gregorylent Gorman_Siobhan Exactly! We need more people who fake elite CVs
peterwsinger	721333908214849536	2016-04-16T13:46:20	The survey also showed growing levels of isolationism even back then (but no one in pundit-land wanted to admit it) 
peterwsinger	721333241094021120	2016-04-16T13:43:41	Only 9 of ~300 young Republicans said they admired Palin as leader. We knew was done before either she or media did.

peterwsinger	721323839922290688	2016-04-16T13:06:19	You certainly don't.  But a great deal of the reporting given to it does. That's the "hook" for media and public.   
peterwsinger	721323045512679424	2016-04-16T13:03:10	And notably, unlike past versions, zombies with no human cause to prevent (like nukes).  Instead "gun up" and wait. 
peterwsinger	721322667232641025	2016-04-16T13:01:40	Instead their not so buried fears are zombies 
peterwsinger	721320779695136768	2016-04-16T12:54:10	Instead, the few that saw the movie will just have unresolved questions about time travel and geriatrics.

peterwsinger	715990977840807937	2016-04-01T19:55:26	Finally, in world of machines with human equivalent reasoning + faster processing, still have human pilots. Realism.

peterwsinger	715989256317984768	2016-04-01T19:48:35	Another interesting issue is stealth. They have it in StarWars , but don't have the fiction it solves all issues.

peterwsinger	715986213295882240	2016-04-01T19:36:30	Another lesson is that X Wing had spiral development: first Z-95, then T65, T65B, XJ, XJ3, XJ5, XJ6 etc.
