conorsen	708704860284329988	2016-03-12T17:23:00	jakehuneycutt In the near term that seems inevitable.
conorsen	708704476962619392	2016-03-12T17:21:29	jakehuneycutt It'll strengthen the GOP's hand, not clear about his. Maybe the mood will swing even more populist/protectionist.

conorsen	708701624571658240	2016-03-12T17:10:08	KStreetHipster Something concerning to me is the Trump effect is causing liberals to become more negative and bitter too, vicious cycle.

conorsen	708697906895822848	2016-03-12T16:55:22	lymanstoneky My guess is Trump support is highest in places with very little in/out migration.

conorsen	708680883700510720	2016-03-12T15:47:43	adamcarstens Recessions tend to lead to re-alignments (WV/KY), and it's hard to speculate about what impact the next one will have.
conorsen	708680677001068544	2016-03-12T15:46:54	adamcarstens Okay, that's fair.
conorsen	708680474336473088	2016-03-12T15:46:06	adamcarstens I'm guessing about where things are 8-12 years in the future, so I'm downplaying recent numbers somewhat.

conorsen	704855816948609025	2016-03-02T02:28:17	carriekdeal generally -- Rubio's support is neither broad nor deep enough
conorsen	704855497959194625	2016-03-02T02:27:00	mattyglesias Why would that go better than MA?
conorsen	704855166974095360	2016-03-02T02:25:42	The only good geographies Rubio has are well-educated suburbs. There are no good Rubio states.

conorsen	704842116355256320	2016-03-02T01:33:50	It is once again clear that key Republican actors made a mistake by not throwing their support behind Cruz.

conorsen	704838893053411328	2016-03-02T01:21:02	EricaGrieder The more this goes on the more shameful it is that the establishment didn't rally behind Cruz to stop Trump.

conorsen	704738474335870976	2016-03-01T18:42:00	carriekdeal Only wrinkle -- if there's a runoff (not applicable here) you can't vote in the GOP runoff if you voted in the Dem primary.
conorsen	704738388256169984	2016-03-01T18:41:39	carriekdeal In GA, since we don't register by party, you can vote in either primary and then vote for whoever you want in the general.

conorsen	704668822301761536	2016-03-01T14:05:14	adamdharrell Agree with that. This development cycle was Midtown/Buckhead/intown, next will be perimeter-ish suburbs.
conorsen	704668260004929536	2016-03-01T14:02:59	adamdharrell And our aspirations are for suburban homeownership. You can't get voters to prioritize things they don't want.

conorsen	704666854409818113	2016-03-01T13:57:24	adamdharrell I still support commuter rail-type expansion to North Fulton etc. I don't support NYC/DC/Boston-type quick hop expansion.
conorsen	704666603447820288	2016-03-01T13:56:24	adamdharrell When you're thinking about a 20+ year infrastructure investment it's something worth keeping in consideration.
conorsen	704666491451547649	2016-03-01T13:55:58	adamdharrell I honestly worry a bit about billions in transit expansion dollars only to be made antiquated by self driving cars.
conorsen	704666107370668032	2016-03-01T13:54:26	EdAsante77 If Cruz wins TX and the establishment flips support from Rubio to Cruz that'd at least be a respectable way to lose.
conorsen	704665693732605953	2016-03-01T13:52:48	adamdharrell But if that's the goal, why not just, you know, invest the millions into corridor econ dev?
conorsen	704665386483064832	2016-03-01T13:51:34	fastjohnny can't argue with that. there's only so much a democratic/coalitional system can do. some things require the strong man.
conorsen	704665250398912516	2016-03-01T13:51:02	adamdharrell I don't think we can trust these people to build, design, and operate effective and efficient transit systems.

conorsen	703280389062660096	2016-02-26T18:08:05	To be fair, Christie might be correctly betting Trump will get indicted and if he's the VP, then he gets to be Prez.

conorsen	703247004256870400	2016-02-26T15:55:26	"Why didn't Cruz and Rubio attack Trump earlier?" asked the journalists mocking tweet spelling.
conorsen	703246718758948864	2016-02-26T15:54:18	mwgarbett Your followers don't see what he's doing, so this will confirm their biases that he's dumb and they should downplay his chances.
conorsen	703246362780049409	2016-02-26T15:52:53	mwgarbett The spelling was intentional. He's playing you for a fool to do free advertising for him.
conorsen	703245973846364161	2016-02-26T15:51:20	mwgarbett Rather than assuming he's a stupid clown, assume he's a master of persuasion and deception and see if it changes your perception.
conorsen	703245567745466368	2016-02-26T15:49:43	mwgarbett He's using the pride of the well-educated against them, like judo.

conorsen	703245116220248065	2016-02-26T15:47:56	mwgarbett It's a device to get you to tweet out to your followers that Rubio is a lightweight choker. Mission accomplished.
conorsen	703242977477595136	2016-02-26T15:39:26	hassankhan How much Super PAC money would it have cost to brand Rubio a lightweight choker? $10s of millions.
conorsen	703242830270095361	2016-02-26T15:38:51	hassankhan There's an elite pride in pointing out his spelling mistakes that's actually a trap they're walking into.
conorsen	703242476321120256	2016-02-26T15:37:26	hassankhan It just showed it doesn't matter how well-educated you are, it doesn't mean you have political intelligence.
conorsen	703241557110083584	2016-02-26T15:33:47	goodtalkruss Yeah, I've been catching up on the Adams posts. Only one who's writing about this from an interesting angle.
conorsen	703239719006707712	2016-02-26T15:26:29	carlquintanilla The effective thing about chocker is when Rubio chokes again, as all candidates do, we'll be primed for it.

conorsen	703231621235916800	2016-02-26T14:54:18	TonyFratto Rather than spending $25 million on TV ads branding Rubio a choker, he just did it for free by misspelling it in a tweet.

conorsen	703227616606687232	2016-02-26T14:38:23	politicalinsidr You just gave him free advertising calling Rubio a choker to your 14,000 followers. He knows what he's doing.
conorsen	703226242229784576	2016-02-26T14:32:56	Trump isn't a demagogue. He's PT Barnum.
conorsen	703225986146504704	2016-02-26T14:31:55	lrzhou Robot was the media's doing. Trump wants choker to stick, because Rubio might stop being robotic but he will choke at some point.
conorsen	703225366769434624	2016-02-26T14:29:27	low-energy lying choker  Thanks to Trump you all know who I'm referring to with each.
conorsen	703225229276016640	2016-02-26T14:28:54	If I wanted to create a word association between a candidate and them being a choker, misspelling it twice in tweets would be effective.
conorsen	703224861620092932	2016-02-26T14:27:26	ComfortablySmug So the next time Rubio screws up, and of course he will, we'll all think "choker."
conorsen	703224796725780480	2016-02-26T14:27:11	ComfortablySmug Also by misspelling choker twice, he's trying to solidify the Rubio/choker word association.
conorsen	703224702161002496	2016-02-26T14:26:48	johndurant Misspelling choker twice is his plan to make the Rubio/choker branding stick. 
conorsen	703224416361177088	2016-02-26T14:25:40	ComfortablySmug Now it's just getting egregious -- wonder if even the well-educated will figure it out. 
conorsen	703220465150640128	2016-02-26T14:09:58	jbarro Remember when we were talking about his taxes? That was a fun 6 hours until he changed the conversation.

conorsen	703218146958839808	2016-02-26T14:00:46	ComfortablySmug One of the brilliant things of this campaign is he's controlled the conversation the entire time.

conorsen	703216827002912768	2016-02-26T13:55:31	Why would he do this? Because everyone's pointing out the Trump/Rubio support gap between college-educated/less-educated. There's a plan.

conorsen	703214042962370560	2016-02-26T13:44:27	BlairReeves I look at his primary persona as an "opening bid" in a negotiation that will get more nuanced over time.
conorsen	703213885453631488	2016-02-26T13:43:50	BlairReeves He's the least predictable candidate -- that's either craziness on his part of a well-honed strategy, hard to know.

conorsen	703206607778418688	2016-02-26T13:14:54	"Look, he misspelled choker! His supporters are stupid!" "Screw the elites" --the ~60% (?) of GOP voters without college degrees
conorsen	703206370619879424	2016-02-26T13:13:58	I'll bet a higher percentage of Trump's tweets these days have misspellings than they did a few years ago. This is intentional and tactical.
