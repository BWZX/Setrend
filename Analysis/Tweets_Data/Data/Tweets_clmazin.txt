clmazin	726116605285945344	2016-04-29T18:31:03	Correct. By the by, the things I hate the most are: 1) Ted Cruz 2) Anti-vax bullshit 3) Fake medicine 
clmazin	726116155954327552	2016-04-29T18:29:16	codyave sahilkapur anamariecox Interesting. I think Ana Marie's adolescent awkwardness isn't quite a parallel to Ted's sociopathy, though
clmazin	726100960544612353	2016-04-29T17:28:53	Ted Cruz sells snake oil to voters. His father sold it to sick people. They're both bible-thumping con artists.

clmazin	725811999255326720	2016-04-28T22:20:40	chasebricker Yes. The adverb is modifying the adjective "no," referring to the quantity of values, which is zero in this case.

clmazin	725802434551934976	2016-04-28T21:42:39	Ted Cruz lies about Kasich because Ted literally has no values. None. Doesn't value the truth. Or his own word. He's utterly honorless.
clmazin	725801922351927296	2016-04-28T21:40:37	Ted Cruz lies AGAIN. Makes a deal with Kasich where Kasich won't run ads in Indiana. Cruz then tells Indiana crowd "Kasich has pulled out."

clmazin	725742034175193088	2016-04-28T17:42:39	Ted Cruz had precisely ONE EVENING where the story was Fiorina. And then Boehner took it to the ring. Hoop! Hoop.

clmazin	725734369948655616	2016-04-28T17:12:11	I think Boehner got to know Ted Cruz pretty well.  
clmazin	725563267704229888	2016-04-28T05:52:17	As far as he possibly can. Further than you think anyone would. Yes, he is.

clmazin	725505450460868608	2016-04-28T02:02:33	He's awful, and he's running for President of the United States of America. That seems reason enough.

clmazin	725412949737644032	2016-04-27T19:54:59	Ted Cruz's short list for VP: Indiana Jones, India Arie, the Indy 500, the nation of India, the Cleveland Indians, Hosier, hosiery, Fiorina.
clmazin	725411704746561536	2016-04-27T19:50:02	MadJones77 johnaugust Interesting.

clmazin	725409109005082624	2016-04-27T19:39:43	No way Ted's ever seen Hoosiers. Had a staffer print him out the Wikipedia plot summary. If that. 
clmazin	725408317410041860	2016-04-27T19:36:34	Yup. It's why Ted Cruz a bad poker player - his calculations are obvious. Hard to be POTUS when you have zero game. 
clmazin	725373732668108800	2016-04-27T17:19:09	Maybe take some time to pick someone YOU are saying could be President? But no. This is about Ted, as always. Who's pre-vetted? Grab 'em!
clmazin	725373092558737408	2016-04-27T17:16:36	The most important qualification for VP is "Can help me grab two days' worth of a news cycle before one primary." Truly disgusting.
clmazin	725372541175386112	2016-04-27T17:14:25	ambrosiality It's a reference to the movie Hoosiers, which is a) a classic, and b) about Indiana basketball.
clmazin	725371288399667200	2016-04-27T17:09:26	If Ted Cruz's "major announcement" is that he's picked his running mate, then tonight will be even more fun than last night.

clmazin	725136123115257856	2016-04-27T01:34:58	A mere concern such as "being liked and chosen" is irrelevant to Ted Cruz. His existence attests to this.

clmazin	724384280638414849	2016-04-24T23:47:25	Dadosaurus1 outdoorgirl_27 You mean subsidies. Tuition paid to a state-run school is state money to be spent by state appointees.

clmazin	724382443143229441	2016-04-24T23:40:07	salys I have less faith than you do in the ability of these schools to actually educate. Or in the interest of the students to be educated.
clmazin	724379779185577984	2016-04-24T23:29:32	n_thurm Or maybe the NBA and NFL would create professional minor leagues where those athletes could get paid. Which is what would happen.

clmazin	724377869154025472	2016-04-24T23:21:56	A state school is spending and earning (but mostly losing) money that isn't state money? Okay. 
clmazin	724377407713472512	2016-04-24T23:20:06	nyousefi Agreed. Certain areas will require places to congregate. But many do not.
clmazin	724377063042355200	2016-04-24T23:18:44	carters_blog plug361 Okay. Explain how more people vying for a relatively fixed number of classroom seats will lower the price.
clmazin	724376711375147009	2016-04-24T23:17:20	This would be true if most schools profited from sports. But...  
clmazin	724376309569216513	2016-04-24T23:15:45	If public higher ed were currently underenrolled, you'd be right. But it's not. So you're not. 
clmazin	724375904596561922	2016-04-24T23:14:08	Public schools spend public money to run public programs. It's the state's money. They *choose* to pay the coaches.

clmazin	724375171872628736	2016-04-24T23:11:13	It's state money, so fair to question where the "profits" of tax investment go. That said, YES. NCAA is slave labor. 
clmazin	724374786231521281	2016-04-24T23:09:41	It's relatively fixed. Slow and expensive to increase capacity (if you can), as college is brick and mortar(board). 
clmazin	724374173120757761	2016-04-24T23:07:15	Yes. McDonald's leverages volume. How does a college campus with fixed supply of seats leverage volume? I'll wait. 
clmazin	724358157590355968	2016-04-24T22:03:37	And yet, they still charge crazy tuition. So... hmm. HMMMMM. Of course, the non-big schools just strive and lose $$$ 
clmazin	724357975452733441	2016-04-24T22:02:53	Yup. College coaches are HIGHEST-PAID PUBLIC EMPLOYEES in ALMOST EVERY SINGLE STATE.

clmazin	724344007040471040	2016-04-24T21:07:23	YES. Yes yes yes. People miss the big one: a massive amount of US higher ed is just professional sports in disguise. 
clmazin	724343716572323849	2016-04-24T21:06:14	If Google decides to run a STEM academy (including testing), a lot of average STEM schools are gonna face the music.

clmazin	720035276542771201	2016-04-12T23:46:02	WGA: Much of the "Yes on 1" argument seems to be "Incumbents support increasing their terms and reducing their accountability, so vote yes."

clmazin	696411524470968320	2016-02-07T19:13:40	Again, I would rather pick someone from the phone book. 
clmazin	696411339212722176	2016-02-07T19:12:56	This is a VERY apt comparison, actually.  
clmazin	696403058759069696	2016-02-07T18:40:02	Ted Cruz is unfit for public service. He shouldn't work at the DMV, much less be President.  
clmazin	696402097634324480	2016-02-07T18:36:13	Yeah, take careful notes. They might come in handy 27 years later.  
clmazin	696207823596748800	2016-02-07T05:44:14	It got very, very chilly in there. 
clmazin	696205611671760897	2016-02-07T05:35:27	jonboyer johnaugust It feels so right.
clmazin	696205517597769728	2016-02-07T05:35:04	AtlantaErin It's worse than that, as I was actually wrong, and she was right. So boo on me, and apologies to her.

clmazin	696205236008984576	2016-02-07T05:33:57	I got there first. Took the top bunk. 
clmazin	696191326795100161	2016-02-07T04:38:41	jonboyer johnaugust They've been levying business taxes forever. But I don't live in Los Angeles, so NOT MAH PROLLEM
clmazin	696189022591258625	2016-02-07T04:29:32	jonboyer johnaugust That's different. That's the City business tax. 
clmazin	696188272398045184	2016-02-07T04:26:33	jonboyer johnaugust Mostly that it can be a red flag for the IRS, and you have to be aware of the rules. 
clmazin	696185520867545088	2016-02-07T04:15:37	TGarRobertson briangarnold Naturally, I disagree as well. As does the AP style guide. Unfortunately, others insist on this ugliness.
clmazin	696181351486062592	2016-02-07T03:59:03	My friend briangarnold has corrected me (correctly). Many (most) style guides say you should add an 's to a possessive name ending in s.
clmazin	696176398709338112	2016-02-07T03:39:22	WildReeds It's the "somehow" that makes it all work. :)
clmazin	696176192030769152	2016-02-07T03:38:33	Ted Cruz says he's against torture, but he'll torture the definition of torture so it's not torture. Yo dawg, we heard you liked torture...
clmazin	696174147571847168	2016-02-07T03:30:25	It's not "astonishing" that Ted keeps lying. It's what he does. To everyone. In fact, it's ALL he does. 
clmazin	696167668399771648	2016-02-07T03:04:40	selowitch Yes, but NOT correct for the possessive, which was the case here.
clmazin	696167479005974529	2016-02-07T03:03:55	FickleProd Actually, 18:21 ... I wish that made me special. It doesn't. I probably wouldn't break the top 100 at the national tournament.
clmazin	696158738852372480	2016-02-07T02:29:12	Sunday Times done. I gotta say... crosswords beat this shit any day of the week. You people are nuts.
clmazin	696153376183046144	2016-02-07T02:07:53	Okay guys, that's as much as I can take. I'm gonna go do the Sunday Times crossword and write my script. Good luck!
clmazin	696153128865902592	2016-02-07T02:06:54	This is amazing. Trump is attacking the crowd. It's almost admirable.
clmazin	696152732311252992	2016-02-07T02:05:19	Trump is 100% correct on eminent domain. I mean, not about the old lady. But in general.
clmazin	696152116558041088	2016-02-07T02:02:53	You know, Carson sounds like someone that actually has experience with health insurance. Oh. Right.
clmazin	696151630073364480	2016-02-07T02:00:57	I need a doctor because Ted's voice is melting my brain.
clmazin	696151333548625920	2016-02-07T01:59:46	Ted responds to "Maybe you have no heart" with a heartless, calculated chuckle.
clmazin	696151168028815361	2016-02-07T01:59:06	It's amazing that "don't let people die on the street" is controversial.
clmazin	696150885605355520	2016-02-07T01:57:59	Sandersiz? No no no, possessive on a name that ends in "s" doesn't get a ziz on it.
clmazin	696150469748469760	2016-02-07T01:56:20	Okay Jersey... ease off the gas... wait, ORDER A PIZZA? I'm back on board.
clmazin	696150179729113088	2016-02-07T01:55:11	These guys calling for walls and troops and biometric hoohahs are the small government guys, right?
clmazin	696149381695692800	2016-02-07T01:52:01	Oof. This is Ted, all right. Creepy, unfunny, mean, boring.
clmazin	696149275193937920	2016-02-07T01:51:35	"I will deport them by forcing them to listen to my voice. They will flee that very night."
clmazin	696149003608526848	2016-02-07T01:50:30	Kasich is literally the only one up there who isn't fucking insane on immigration.
clmazin	696148732115464192	2016-02-07T01:49:26	The moderators know that Carson is still on the stage, right? Does Carson know he's still on the stage?
clmazin	696148600389173248	2016-02-07T01:48:54	Christie's answer is the correct answer. I mean, not the commander-in-chief talking point, but the "don't negotiate with assholes" part.
clmazin	696148351528480768	2016-02-07T01:47:55	I just want to remind people that Jeb is genetically related to GWB. Amazing how "speaking ability" can skip one sibling.
clmazin	696147759968026624	2016-02-07T01:45:34	This is interesting. 1) Trump is correct 2) China controls NK 3) Trump is also proud that he does business with them.
clmazin	696147394921000960	2016-02-07T01:44:07	Jeb ate his Wheaties this morning.
clmazin	696146898206363648	2016-02-07T01:42:08	How does a missile "implicate" something?
clmazin	696146705033482240	2016-02-07T01:41:22	I am enjoying President Cruz' plan to build a time machine and undo NK's missile plan.
clmazin	696146151007866880	2016-02-07T01:39:10	Oh, this is a softball for Cruz. Democrats did this. And carpet bomb! He hasn't said carpet bomb yet, but wait for it wait for it
clmazin	696145858652274688	2016-02-07T01:38:01	It would be great if they repeat this "lack of experience" point... oh good, the MODERATOR did it. Cruz is a first-term nothing.
clmazin	696145569543098371	2016-02-07T01:36:52	They're attacking Rubio because they're freaking out he'll be the establishment candidate. But if this helps Cruz, they will rue it.
clmazin	696145306237345792	2016-02-07T01:35:49	Okay, Christie... TOO MUCH JERSEY... declare victory and pull out!
clmazin	696145086862618624	2016-02-07T01:34:57	Again? Rubio's jukebox is seriously broken.
clmazin	696144964862935041	2016-02-07T01:34:28	Yeah, it's the Jersey in me. I can't help but enjoy Christie when he's swinging his fists.
clmazin	696144645399535616	2016-02-07T01:33:11	Uhhh, someone played the same tape in Rubio's head.
clmazin	696144448346914816	2016-02-07T01:32:24	Maybe it's cuz I'm from Jersey, but I enjoy Christie's swagger.
clmazin	696144064056467456	2016-02-07T01:30:53	Fascinating. I guess all of their advisors said "Okay, time to attack Obama in order to win New Hampshire."
clmazin	696143581552070656	2016-02-07T01:28:58	Carson! A joke that was funny! Also... glad he points out that everything Ted just said was BULLSHIT.
clmazin	696143229993889792	2016-02-07T01:27:34	Here comes a horseshit narrative. Yup, Cruz leaves out the part where they said Carson wasn't suspending his campaign. The rest is blahblah.
clmazin	696142951412420608	2016-02-07T01:26:27	And now... for Ted's carefully prepared answer.
clmazin	696142747451850753	2016-02-07T01:25:39	Ted is listening to Carson and thinking, "What is this road? It is not a low road. It is a... high road? DO NOT UNDERSTAND."
clmazin	696142139772657665	2016-02-07T01:23:14	Watching the debate. Ted says something. "Do you believe that, Ted?" "NOT SAYING. REPEATING MEMORIZED ANSWERS  END OF TRANSMISSION"

clmazin	695679268685086720	2016-02-05T18:43:57	Yes. This is what his fellow senators and Republicans don't understand-- being hated is all he's ever known.

clmazin	695166542753845248	2016-02-04T08:46:34	FTA: Essentially Ted ignored the inconvenient part of CNN's report that Carson was not dropping out of the race. 
clmazin	695165489073369088	2016-02-04T08:42:22	Classic Ted. Implies Carson drops out of the race. Then claims "I just meant he was going home." His voice pitches way up when he lies, btw.

clmazin	695012114310701057	2016-02-03T22:32:55	No. Ted can't get anything done in Congress. Killing me would mean he'd have to convince someone of something.
