sriramk	702617920120057856	2016-02-24T22:15:40	fmanjoo kevinroose but that's a hypothetical - the baseline/comparison here is doing nothing. The q is - is this worse than doing nothing?
sriramk	702617116038402049	2016-02-24T22:12:29	hunterwalk does time spent on composing angry tweets count?
sriramk	702616838031605760	2016-02-24T22:11:22	fmanjoo kevinroose let's say this fund gets just 1 student an education Stanford couldn't/wouldn't fund. Isn't that "good"?
sriramk	702616580379705344	2016-02-24T22:10:21	fmanjoo kevinroose that's *definitely* burning money there ;)
sriramk	702616294013554688	2016-02-24T22:09:13	fmanjoo kevinroose on a moral scale, I disagree. Getting even few students an education &gt;yachts/buying old print media papers
sriramk	702616010738642944	2016-02-24T22:08:05	kevinroose loyalelectron but they're not. Whatever Stanford could do, this is that+300 (or whatever the number).
sriramk	702615143654404096	2016-02-24T22:04:38	kevinroose plus, ppl feel emotional ties to alma matter. If we see a celeb plug a cause during Oscars, we wouldn't go "X needs it more!"
sriramk	702614744260222976	2016-02-24T22:03:03	kevinroose that's a fair q (we saw this w/ Paulson+Harvard). But ineffective, for me, is far away from "not good" (as a moral value)
sriramk	702614201391456257	2016-02-24T22:00:54	kevinroose libbybrittain the reasoning in the piece is - Stanford is rich-&gt;too many founders-&gt;technotopia-&gt;hence bad place for charity
sriramk	702613685127098368	2016-02-24T21:58:51	kevinroose libbybrittain No but that's an extreme. On the spectrum between good and bad, Stanford is closer to good than Westboro Church.
sriramk	702613524632047617	2016-02-24T21:58:12	kevinroose I will bet that if he had bought a $400m yacht, we wouldn't have seen any press at all. Which seems deeply wrong to me.
sriramk	702613345749200896	2016-02-24T21:57:30	kevinroose sure, I don't think that'll change any of this. These folks aren't doing this for tax reasons (vanity, ego: definitely)
sriramk	702612755308654592	2016-02-24T21:55:09	libbybrittain my framework is - his money, he gets to spend it however. And any donation of any kind is worthy of praise.
sriramk	702612223886110721	2016-02-24T21:53:02	Such a terrible crime - wanting to give away your money to a place of your choosing. The horror.

sriramk	701286356601798656	2016-02-21T06:04:31	xander76 NateSilver538 my point is - it was bad data science. Insufficient past data and a perfect outlier event.
sriramk	701285693461385217	2016-02-21T06:01:53	xander76 NateSilver538 if you see , Nate ignored polls (as he should) but then made a prediction anyway.
sriramk	701284921403318273	2016-02-21T05:58:49	xander76 NateSilver538 no offense to Nate but pretty much anyone could make that guess *now*.
sriramk	701216895802847232	2016-02-21T01:28:30	rickyvanveen no doubt.   And special shoutout to Slate who managed to put out an entire opinion column

sriramk	701210257016561664	2016-02-21T01:02:07	hunterwalk nicely done ( and very required too). Vox was the other person who went deep into this story.

sriramk	698677648302551040	2016-02-14T01:18:26	DrPizza I think Democrats/left would have picked same sex rights, possible rulings on other civil issues over downside of obstructionism.
sriramk	698676937057644544	2016-02-14T01:15:37	DrPizza I'm actually unsure on whether being obstructionist hurts in an election ( as opposed to "giving in" to the other side)

sriramk	698674969748701184	2016-02-14T01:07:48	DrPizza doubt that. Clear then that next President would be Dem. Worth obstructing to get stuff like same-sex marriage right?
sriramk	698636932142661633	2016-02-13T22:36:39	My favorite piece on Scalia. Hilarious, entertaining, disturbing, maybe offensive and insightful
