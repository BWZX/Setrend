hedgefundinvest	718408042115674112	2016-04-08T11:59:59	Advocating for a clean tax policy are most Americans. Against are most lawyers and CPAs. Problem? Probably.
hedgefundinvest	718407886943174656	2016-04-08T11:59:22	Anyway -- get this --  US taxes are a problem, regardless of one's belief on the political spectrum. And taxes are... big.
hedgefundinvest	718407648782217216	2016-04-08T11:58:25	Hard. If memory serves me right, and it never does, I believe 1986 was the last time there was a major overhaul.

hedgefundinvest	718407366316847105	2016-04-08T11:57:18	The US Fed has repeatedly said that a fiscal policy change is necessary. With this Congress, nothing will happen.
hedgefundinvest	718407161441828864	2016-04-08T11:56:29	It seems to me... I swear I'm kidding on a certain level... the most important thing for a citizen to memorize is the tax code. :-/
hedgefundinvest	718406889277648896	2016-04-08T11:55:24	The tax policy immediately creates an asset class. (Think munis, as an easy example. cc: cate_long) This asset class now perpetuates.
hedgefundinvest	718406727352336386	2016-04-08T11:54:45	... when a special interest is able to push through a tax break, it benefits all holders of that asset class. *And future holders.*
hedgefundinvest	718406599950409728	2016-04-08T11:54:15	I am no tax expert, but pretty damn close on certain issues. The US tax code is rife with special interests. This is what is interesting...
hedgefundinvest	718406423479197696	2016-04-08T11:53:33	As someone once famous said: "Corporations are peeps." Are these peeps doing what would be considered fair?
hedgefundinvest	718406147816996864	2016-04-08T11:52:27	Slowly, but surely, loopholes highlighted by tax inversions, Panama Papers, etc. will close. Methinks this just sped up. A lot.
hedgefundinvest	718405881910718464	2016-04-08T11:51:24	Yes. This is true. But it isn't the entire picture. It's a rather involved spectacle of matching country revenue/profits to tax owed/paid.
hedgefundinvest	718405646622842880	2016-04-08T11:50:28	American companies will argue that they are paying higher taxes than competitors, hence are "uncompetitive" in shareholder returns.
hedgefundinvest	718405476497649664	2016-04-08T11:49:47	This convo actually links to the failed Pfizer/Allergan "merger." Tax inversions are a "no go" these days. This brings up problems.

hedgefundinvest	690868301484969984	2016-01-23T12:06:53	Scaramucci Fair enough. Do you think there is a problem w/American conservatism? It isn't consistent these days, loyalty aside.
