DavidTaggart	722569247293976578	2016-04-19T23:35:07	NoonSixCap I think the whole structure of the market has changed a lot. With it came higher valuations among other things
DavidTaggart	722566093693329408	2016-04-19T23:22:36	36/one more-if the US market is too expensive for you, and its not cheap, go buy some foreign equities. Some are way way cheap.
DavidTaggart	722565901258653696	2016-04-19T23:21:50	35/rant off.Hopefully that wasnt too annoying.If it was you are probably massively short or have missed this entire bull JK...but not really
DavidTaggart	722565621376901122	2016-04-19T23:20:43	34/and because they are a wasting asset they almost force you to think harder before risking the $ cause on avg shorting is not a great plan
DavidTaggart	722565465181069313	2016-04-19T23:20:06	33/stops, and size your positions small.  Or use some options. You can only lose what you put into them and for a small outlay you get juice
DavidTaggart	722565314446143489	2016-04-19T23:19:30	32/break there is plenty of money to make in a short amount of time. So wait for times when things really are different, pick and entry, use
DavidTaggart	722565167561609216	2016-04-19T23:18:55	31/use the same basic thought process for shorting the market. Keep the hurdle really high. BTW on the rare occasions when the market really
DavidTaggart	722565011504123904	2016-04-19T23:18:18	30/would I fight Chuck Norris? Sure but only if his legs are broken and his beard was shaved off.Pick your spots, dont fight a healthy Chuck
DavidTaggart	722564790137192448	2016-04-19T23:17:25	29/that or bask in the glory of losing your money.  BTW I used to short a lot more than I do now. Still do it, just a lot less.
DavidTaggart	722564575753691136	2016-04-19T23:16:34	28/so shorting is fine, horting the market is fine,but dont short just on valuation, or the fed, or whatev. also have a risk management plan
DavidTaggart	722564404533809153	2016-04-19T23:15:53	27/barring nukes, plagues, aliens, we know that on average youll grow to retirement and need $. On average you should plan for that scenario
DavidTaggart	722564216603828224	2016-04-19T23:15:08	26/but you do realize that if that stuff happens you are dead so you wont get paid on your shorts and your gold will be useless and etc.
DavidTaggart	722564073762607104	2016-04-19T23:14:34	25/that you want to short to 0 you are wrong. Ok more like 999/1000 times. I mean one day this will all end. Nukes, aliens, something
DavidTaggart	722563881604808705	2016-04-19T23:13:48	24/so its not that there is never a case to short. there definitely is, it is just that the hurdle is ridiculously high. So 9/10 times
DavidTaggart	722563703355215873	2016-04-19T23:13:06	23/a lot of people have missed the massive move from 263% move from the bottom. That is no way to live
DavidTaggart	722563489873539072	2016-04-19T23:12:15	22/a guru who is calling for like 600 on the S&amp;P then you have to ask "are things really that different" and what if you are wrong?
DavidTaggart	722563250617868290	2016-04-19T23:11:18	21/short term traders are a bit different but they cut their losses quickly so they are going for smaller moves. If you are listening to
DavidTaggart	722563121785647104	2016-04-19T23:10:47	20/so the bar to short the overall market is really high. You need tons of fundamentals as well as the timing right.
DavidTaggart	722562968236335104	2016-04-19T23:10:10	19/why? well the Fed has been creating bubbles since it was created and guess what?  The market is up a few thousand percent since then.
DavidTaggart	722562845200637952	2016-04-19T23:09:41	18/saying "the market is expensive and the Fed has made a bubble" is a pile of crap. that excuse absolutely sucks.
DavidTaggart	722562721854529536	2016-04-19T23:09:12	17/so does it ever make sense to short the market?  Sure but here is the deal-you need to have a really really really really good reason
DavidTaggart	722562574202437632	2016-04-19T23:08:36	16/so like 99% of flows are INTO assets and not out of them.
DavidTaggart	722562463711924225	2016-04-19T23:08:10	15/almost no one ken lay and jeff skilling being an exception :-)
DavidTaggart	722562376038424577	2016-04-19T23:07:49	14/the whole game is geared towards better companies and higher stock prices. I mean who goes to work and tries to make their company go bk?
DavidTaggart	722562225085415424	2016-04-19T23:07:13	13/rich people just look at the tax code and say"oh I can save a gazillion $ over the course of my life by owning stuff....awesome"and do it
DavidTaggart	722562028712243201	2016-04-19T23:06:26	12/a regular acct youre still taxed at a lower rate than income if you hold for 12 months.Romney did nothing wrong owning long term assets
DavidTaggart	722561791834783745	2016-04-19T23:05:30	11/you are literally incentivized by the government to invest on a tax deferred and lower taxed rate. In a retirement acct you are deferred
DavidTaggart	722561594190737408	2016-04-19T23:04:43	10/the past 30+ years they have been even rarer.Good luck with that. The game is rigged to go higher. 401ks, IRA,s, pensions, etc all invest
DavidTaggart	722561401827385344	2016-04-19T23:03:57	9/but very few of you were trading "back in the day" and I wasnt even alive so forget it. Single digit PE's have always been rare and in
DavidTaggart	722561183136358400	2016-04-19T23:03:05	8/to see an upward drift in the bottom end of valuations. So yeah the market is always a bit more expensive than "back in the day"
DavidTaggart	722561018304397312	2016-04-19T23:02:25	7/well if you look at valuations over time for the US you will see that as the market was institutionalized in the 60's we started
DavidTaggart	722560851341758465	2016-04-19T23:01:46	6/on average that means that it is a bad trade to short the overall market. Oh but valuations are stretched or earnings are coming down
DavidTaggart	722560663210446848	2016-04-19T23:01:01	5/which trend? Well as VicNiederhoffer has pointed out several times you are fighting a gazillion% upward drift. Around 8%/yr for 100+ yrs
DavidTaggart	722560428618809344	2016-04-19T23:00:05	4/but to short one of the major indices is on average a fools game. Sometimes it is a good thing but on avg you are fighting a trend
DavidTaggart	722560185613422592	2016-04-19T22:59:07	3/in fact a lot of them go to 0. Not in a straight line but to 0 nonetheless. Great piece on that. 
DavidTaggart	722559865827119106	2016-04-19T22:57:51	2/want to know a secret? On average shorting the market is a horrible bet. Individual companies?  If they suck short them. Some of them suck
DavidTaggart	722559710864355331	2016-04-19T22:57:14	1/rant time. SP500 closed today at all time highs. Perma-bears are still all doom and gloom calling for mega drops

DavidTaggart	722533625732837376	2016-04-19T21:13:35	jverse74 yes/no.which valuations? Absolute or relative? Relative to other assets stocks are decent+we dont have forward USD/oil headwinds

DavidTaggart	722527129632514048	2016-04-19T20:47:46	So if you look at total return...and you should, you'll see that we hit a new all time high today in the SP500 today

DavidTaggart	711901350393565184	2016-03-21T13:04:43	georgepearkes VRX is a ***show. You just need to find the next Paulson size trade to become the new major donor
DavidTaggart	711806300535988225	2016-03-21T06:47:01	kels_garner 5lbtrout I drive a metal box and therefore am always in less danger than someone riding a bike
DavidTaggart	711806121250463744	2016-03-21T06:46:18	kels_garner 5lbtrout hate that we get tickets for not wearing seat belts but people are allowed on a mcycle at all. Very inconsistent laws
DavidTaggart	711792013243363328	2016-03-21T05:50:15	But they still see planes all the time.
DavidTaggart	711791791595331584	2016-03-21T05:49:22	Aside from Guantanamo the last USA planes they saw were probably some that JFK called back instead of actually helping at Bay of Pigs though
DavidTaggart	711791564041768960	2016-03-21T05:48:27	Everyone does know that Cubans have seen planes before right? I don't get why that AF1 pic is such a big deal.
DavidTaggart	711778058684870656	2016-03-21T04:54:48	justin_hicken JimmyRex but then after watching that oregon team tonight maybe the entire PAC is a 8-9 with them.
DavidTaggart	711777590407614465	2016-03-21T04:52:56	justin_hicken JimmyRex Entire PAC=maybe a 7. Minus Oregon more like a 10.

DavidTaggart	711772385880330240	2016-03-21T04:32:15	byuROC GJMcClintock but despite my single status I think it would be way cooler if we caught a real cougar in the wild.

DavidTaggart	711761827315654657	2016-03-21T03:50:18	SeanBingham hopefully. Even if Oregon wins this game I think the whole tournament is good proof that PAC is way way way overrated

DavidTaggart	697178629558575104	2016-02-09T22:01:52	BrattleStCap and we dont export a whole lot. Add to that cheap gas, low inflation, and wages rising (slowly but still rising) and things..

DavidTaggart	697156378696101888	2016-02-09T20:33:27	bigunclepooh of course with what they are charging us for tickets these days the gear would not actually be "free" but more a bonus
DavidTaggart	697156225620799488	2016-02-09T20:32:51	bigunclepooh season ticket holders should get "free" gear. The longer you have suffered through this the more gear you get.I love this plan

DavidTaggart	696063148785152000	2016-02-06T20:09:21	cirrusdriver the countries are easy enough but the oil debt is harder. Been looking at some high yield CEF's trading at big discounts

DavidTaggart	696061698810097664	2016-02-06T20:03:35	krscapital jake_f but if you have true long term $ like Swenson, and understand the benefits of it, like Swenson, it is a great thing
DavidTaggart	696061509139456000	2016-02-06T20:02:50	krscapital jake_f but we all know most investors lie to themselves about their position and under perform due to several mismatches

DavidTaggart	696061134864912384	2016-02-06T20:01:21	krscapital jake_f think true long term $ seeking illiquids are usually early in the different cycles. cause they are long term and know it

DavidTaggart	696060760875671552	2016-02-06T19:59:52	krscapital jake_f no but look at the returns the smart investors have gotten even after writing them down from the peaks.
DavidTaggart	696060627018608640	2016-02-06T19:59:20	jake_f krscapital not to mention the risks of liquidity mismatch. But for Swenson like people he is completely right, as is Jake_f
DavidTaggart	696060444037902336	2016-02-06T19:58:36	jake_f krscapital just because it is illiquid it has a premium. Obvs not the case and w/added risk its harder to be right.
DavidTaggart	696060302593359872	2016-02-06T19:58:02	jake_f krscapital kind of agree I think illiquidity still has a "premium" for truly smart money. But a lot get suckered into thinking that

DavidTaggart	693200717079822336	2016-01-29T22:35:04	31/if thats not a form of timing then F you :-) But seriously.
DavidTaggart	693200617586696192	2016-01-29T22:34:40	30/the same thing. He saw what his downside was, thought about the potential upside, and saw massive skew. he then loaded the boat
DavidTaggart	693200469922045952	2016-01-29T22:34:05	29/things were looking really bad for AMEX and he stepped in and bought. In the same philosophical way as Druck, but different tools, he did
DavidTaggart	693200140702765056	2016-01-29T22:32:47	28/many of his biggest buys, and wins, have been when he bought at the point of max pessimism. Remember the salad oil scandal? Yeah
DavidTaggart	693199908778741761	2016-01-29T22:31:51	27/if you think that WarrenB, not to be confused with WarrenG, is NOT a timer you do not read
DavidTaggart	693199750288404481	2016-01-29T22:31:14	26/there is no way to manage risk or even measure potential risk/reward then you too are a timer of sorts.
DavidTaggart	693199614770552833	2016-01-29T22:30:41	25/in summary unless you think that there is no way to measure when things are more and less dangerous to your money. Unless you think that
DavidTaggart	693199423434854401	2016-01-29T22:29:56	24/sorry for the tangent.
DavidTaggart	693199368262979584	2016-01-29T22:29:43	23/long safety and short danger when things blow up....kind of like the prop desks of old did.
DavidTaggart	693199213350494208	2016-01-29T22:29:06	22/the vol selling is basically the investment banking operations making money when times are good. and the trend following system gets you
DavidTaggart	693199035893706753	2016-01-29T22:28:23	21/as a sidenote if you want to replicate the earnings of the I-banks of old run an option selling strategy and a trend following strategy
DavidTaggart	693198819023048705	2016-01-29T22:27:32	20/and then you made a gazillion bucks.  This is how they operate. They trade as many markets as possible so that they catch the big trends
DavidTaggart	693198673254154240	2016-01-29T22:26:57	19/they are willing to lose a little bit fairly often to make a boatload less often. Look at oil or the Euro.You get chopped chopped chopped
DavidTaggart	693198487622676480	2016-01-29T22:26:13	18/they are not betting on any individual market so much but instead betting that their process will by definition catch the big trends
DavidTaggart	693198311508025345	2016-01-29T22:25:31	17/position sizing, etc. they buy when something is moving up based on their criteria and sell when its going down based on their criteria.
DavidTaggart	693198153131102212	2016-01-29T22:24:53	16/they are betting on long term positive skew. They are looking for trends and using a risk management system that covers entry/exit,
DavidTaggart	693197946037391360	2016-01-29T22:24:03	15/finally, at least for now, we have another very misunderstood group of folks. They usually go by the term "trend followers"
DavidTaggart	693197764843454464	2016-01-29T22:23:20	14/that is a far cry from the anti-timers who think that every active manager is trying to catch every tick up or down.
DavidTaggart	693197583481716737	2016-01-29T22:22:37	13/so they are looking for great opportunities and timing them in order to take what they perceive to be the least risk for the most reward
DavidTaggart	693197392485703680	2016-01-29T22:21:52	12/so its not "I caught every 5% move up or down in the SP500 this year" but instead "I lever up when I find a great 5:1 trade and print $"
DavidTaggart	693197187866607620	2016-01-29T22:21:03	11/what he and other traders, especially of the leveraged variety, are looking for are great risk/reward trades.They then try and time those
DavidTaggart	693197030110433280	2016-01-29T22:20:25	10/Someone like Druckenmiller, from all my readings and listenings which = all of it, doesnt obsess over every 1% move up or down in markets
DavidTaggart	693196810693795840	2016-01-29T22:19:33	9/so that is one school of successful market timing. The other school of timing is where you are timing specific opportunities.
DavidTaggart	693196705496481792	2016-01-29T22:19:08	hmeisler no but hes well known enough that no one has an excise to have not read at least his work
DavidTaggart	693196523799232512	2016-01-29T22:18:24	8/so instead of saying "I am bullish lets buy" and "I am bearish lets sell" it was "I am this % bullish" Humongous difference
DavidTaggart	693196350079516672	2016-01-29T22:17:43	7/relative to how bullish or bearish the environment seemed using Zweigs toolbox of technical, economic, fundamental, and sentiment tools
DavidTaggart	693196166159286273	2016-01-29T22:16:59	6/Zweig-Dimenna is almost always, if not always, net long. They used, and I assume still use, Zweigs tools to gauge their level of exposure
DavidTaggart	693195963473760256	2016-01-29T22:16:11	5/If you read Marty Zweig, and if you have not WTF there is no excuse, then you have read how he talks about degrees of bullish/bearishness
DavidTaggart	693195704890691585	2016-01-29T22:15:09	4/anything aside from dollar cost averaging/regular calendar based deposits into your index funds are a form of market timing. But I digress
DavidTaggart	693195490247180289	2016-01-29T22:14:18	3/they are not. In addition most people think that "value investing" is not market timing....it is
DavidTaggart	693195378091499524	2016-01-29T22:13:51	2/most people seem to think that the typical person who tries to "time" their investments is taking an all in/all out approach.
DavidTaggart	693195246121963520	2016-01-29T22:13:20	1/It's Friday after hours so I guess Ill go on a little rant on market-timing theory and practice.

DavidTaggart	692775688600879109	2016-01-28T18:26:09	hobocita big difference between a commercial and home treadmill/cardio stuff. Home gets used maybe 1hr/day for 2-5 years.
DavidTaggart	692775476071309312	2016-01-28T18:25:19	hobocita supervised however, or with simple things like free weights, you could just buy all the equipment from a failed Crossfit franchise
DavidTaggart	692775302938759168	2016-01-28T18:24:38	hobocita costs can be relatively low even if equipment costs are not
DavidTaggart	692775206729809920	2016-01-28T18:24:15	hobocita for using old used equipment. Also I think a lot of the maintenance on some of the stuff is "warrantied" for a while so maintenece
DavidTaggart	692775060369592320	2016-01-28T18:23:40	hobocita arent you a lawyer? Do you want that liability?  Last thing Id want is for a new lifter to get hurt on a machine and then sue me
DavidTaggart	692773736370425856	2016-01-28T18:18:24	hobocita and they tend to not be in a warehouse looking building
DavidTaggart	692773662424838146	2016-01-28T18:18:06	hobocita an Anytime Fitness type place would cost more to get going. They have tons of machines and treadmills and stuff.
DavidTaggart	692773359508021250	2016-01-28T18:16:54	hobocita mainly I was referring to the basic model. They are very no frills, take pride in it really, and tend to charge a flat monthly fee
DavidTaggart	692773176351158272	2016-01-28T18:16:11	hobocita a lot of them also have specific training like "Olympic style lifts" , mobility, etc.
DavidTaggart	692773037230280704	2016-01-28T18:15:37	hobocita for the most part they are but its more like a personal trainer for a group of people instead of just 1
DavidTaggart	692769896900403200	2016-01-28T18:03:09	hobocita so a Crossfit gym? They are no frills, are usually owner operated, and their fees tend to be fairly straightforward.
DavidTaggart	692768014765195264	2016-01-28T17:55:40	hobocita what type of gym would you want to open?

DavidTaggart	687436648494186496	2016-01-14T00:50:43	CAVandy georgepearkes I think Trump and HRC are the worst people in this election. Kinda sad state of affairs that they are the "leaders"
DavidTaggart	687436054278868992	2016-01-14T00:48:21	CAVandy georgepearkes not really. but thats besides the point. Campaign finance is a mess....kinda like the tax code. DC loves complexity
