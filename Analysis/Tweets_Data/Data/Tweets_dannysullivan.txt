dannysullivan	725115207572439041	2016-04-27T00:11:52	lutherlowe the key difference is that embeds don't really encourage downloading the images; google images certainly does
dannysullivan	725114977326096385	2016-04-27T00:10:57	lutherlowe here's example of a getty embed which gives very little incentive to visit the getty site 
dannysullivan	725113758557855744	2016-04-27T00:06:06	lutherlowe here's google search that finds getty image on google. getty doesn't like as no reason to click to site 
dannysullivan	725112851984060416	2016-04-27T00:02:30	lutherlowe neither of those are slam-dunks to kill the complaint. they just make it messier
dannysullivan	725112707288961024	2016-04-27T00:01:56	lutherlowe 2) allowing anyone to embed makes it difficult for search engines to point to the canonical image or police it better
dannysullivan	725112562061205504	2016-04-27T00:01:21	lutherlowe 1) complaining that they lose revenue when full images are shown is odd when they literally encourage people to do that

dannysullivan	725106462104539136	2016-04-26T23:37:07	Overall, though, I felt the Google Images move to make images size larger detracted from clickthrough to publishers in a bad way.

dannysullivan	710614132316196864	2016-03-17T23:49:46	scottkarp most readers of LA Times &amp; OC Register are paying nothing, so talk about circulation is dumb
dannysullivan	710614045406027776	2016-03-17T23:49:25	scottkarp there are for both. but the DoJ is talking about print, not recognizing few buy print or digital of either paper
dannysullivan	710613309922279425	2016-03-17T23:46:30	I’m one of last people in OC to take physical paper, LA Times because I get my local daily with it. Times+Register means more for me
dannysullivan	710612799227998208	2016-03-17T23:44:28	DoJ isn’t going to save SoCal newspaper competition. There’s no competition now, with so few readers. It’s like saving telegraph competition
dannysullivan	710612358452740096	2016-03-17T23:42:43	stevesi I’m not an expert, but basing monopoly objections on things around print is short-sighted and perhaps groups to fight back
dannysullivan	710612184871481344	2016-03-17T23:42:02	The DoJ is going to help competition by blocking Tribune-Register just like it did blocking Google-Yahoo. That worked out well, right?
dannysullivan	710611993191841792	2016-03-17T23:41:16	DoJ worries purchase means Tribune will spend less on local journalism in OC. Like there’s more for the Tribune to really cut now?
dannysullivan	710611813868527616	2016-03-17T23:40:33	stevesi it’s like worrying about a monopoly over the telegraph sales. it’s a monopoly of a dying industry
dannysullivan	710611660440936448	2016-03-17T23:39:57	DoJ worries Tribune monopoly will push ad rates higher. Haha. Has it seen plunge in newspaper ad rates? That’s why Register is being sold
dannysullivan	710611422846144512	2016-03-17T23:39:00	… Tribune would have “monopoly” over 10% of OC residents who actually read the ocregister. 90% don’t. This requires anti-trust action?
dannysullivan	710611248379867136	2016-03-17T23:38:18	DoJ worries Tribune will have monopoly over newspapers in OC. Register has circulation of 300K, as best. So….

dannysullivan	697686374682460160	2016-02-11T07:39:28	Why not make this "How to fix Twitter" stuff a hashtag discussion? In a tweet, how would you fixtwitter ?

dannysullivan	697684130482401280	2016-02-11T07:30:33	Any number of things could spin from Twitter as standalone apps. Though agree with JoshConstine, making more off existing base surest shot
dannysullivan	697683824541437952	2016-02-11T07:29:20	Vine &amp; Periscope are kind of Twitter spin-offs. Twitter could spin messaging like Facebook did. Twitter could have one-way news app.
dannysullivan	697683529744822273	2016-02-11T07:28:10	Nice from JoshConstine on Twitter challenges but fourth option exists: spin-offs

dannysullivan	697564523411025920	2016-02-10T23:35:17	kelvinnewman danbarker not always. sometimes you’re mentioning someone positively &amp; simply want to start the tweet with their name
dannysullivan	697562483859402752	2016-02-10T23:27:10	danbarker yep. i mean, having to do the . thing is confusing. but having @ not go to the world was also a good change
dannysullivan	697561735205486592	2016-02-10T23:24:12	danbarker that way celebrities &amp; others don’t see stuff don’t want unless they deliberately look. there are some options already like this.
dannysullivan	697561486328070144	2016-02-10T23:23:13	danbarker I suspect it might be that you wouldn’t automatically see replies except from people you follow in notifications…
dannysullivan	697561356757667841	2016-02-10T23:22:42	vandusen exactly
dannysullivan	697560835141427200	2016-02-10T23:20:37	vandusen i think it’s cultural. there’s a sense that once tweeted, forever that’s hard to overcome. but edits in short period could work
dannysullivan	697560553716224000	2016-02-10T23:19:30	brian_carnell which, again, is about rules on behavior and abuse not that the reply rules themselves are confusing.

dannysullivan	697560296672489472	2016-02-10T23:18:29	steveplunkett i think that if Facebook Instagram and even Google+ can allow you to edit a post, Twitter has the tech chops to do it.
dannysullivan	697560128216694784	2016-02-10T23:17:49	vandusen if someone tweets it’s instead of its &amp; realizes a minute later oops, want to fix my grammar, that doesn’t have to be forever :)
dannysullivan	697559641161494529	2016-02-10T23:15:53	brian_carnell exactly. it’s not that reply rules are driving people away; abusive replies are
dannysullivan	697559562849689600	2016-02-10T23:15:34	steveplunkett they’re not instantly added
dannysullivan	697559491261255681	2016-02-10T23:15:17	BusinessWire I understand that. Agree that could change; it’s hardly the problem that’s driving people away from Twitter

dannysullivan	696082907543154688	2016-02-06T21:27:52	Look at "while you were away" at the top of your TL. Tweets you missed from people you follow. Pull to refresh to go back to real-time.
dannysullivan	696081671293001728	2016-02-06T21:22:57	Twitter is live. Twitter is real-time. Twitter is about who &amp; what you follow. And Twitter is here to stay! By becoming more Twitter-y.
dannysullivan	696081566032723968	2016-02-06T21:22:32	Hello Twitter! Regarding RIPTwitter: I want you all to know we're always listening. We never planned to reorder timelines next week.
dannysullivan	696093690230476800	2016-02-06T22:10:43	gassee I'll see if I can get him and some friends talking :)
dannysullivan	696074859688759296	2016-02-06T20:55:53	And now both my teens are debating social media platforms. I should Periscope them! Maybe in the future. Right now, weekend time with them.
dannysullivan	696074393567387648	2016-02-06T20:54:02	Now my 17-year-old is home. He thinks Twitter is fine, likes it. Only uses Facebook when forced to for school stuff. Like his LinkedIn
dannysullivan	696073489959137280	2016-02-06T20:50:27	kougarov mcuban yes that's the issue. You can do some of these things but they're hard
dannysullivan	696073228230352896	2016-02-06T20:49:24	mcuban overall he doesn't see Twitter as broken. Little changes, sure. But it's not like "old &amp; boring Facebook"
dannysullivan	696072679648944129	2016-02-06T20:47:13	mcuban wants to favorite particular Twitter accounts to easily jump to those and see what people are tweeting
dannysullivan	696072269236285440	2016-02-06T20:45:36	mcuban heh! OK he wants longer tweets but with read more option. Wants to be able to easily save trading hashtags as screens can swipe to
dannysullivan	696071494724550657	2016-02-06T20:42:31	PhotiosM GeDesPi no one is seriously suggesting that you'd have to pay for a chrono feed. I highly doubt that would happen
dannysullivan	696071201467138048	2016-02-06T20:41:21	jcoronella yes both
dannysullivan	696066290423693312	2016-02-06T20:21:50	It's all good. My 14-year-old is explaining to me all the ways he'd save Twitter. He loves it. Doesn't even have Facebook on his phone.
dannysullivan	696057522860351489	2016-02-06T19:47:00	iPeggy but the relevancy is terrible. and it doesn't work to give top tweets from those you follow.
dannysullivan	696057008919674880	2016-02-06T19:44:57	Khanoisseur yep, exactly
dannysullivan	696056432584630272	2016-02-06T19:42:40	MagentaRocks which is probably how things will remain. an algo timeline likely will be an option to make finding top tweets easier
dannysullivan	696055372847538177	2016-02-06T19:38:27	TheFireTracker2 then you'll continue to use the live timeline that almost certainly will remain the default
dannysullivan	696053913196171264	2016-02-06T19:32:39	dberkowitz agreed, love Lin_Manuel tweets almost as much as Hamilton. twitter shouldn't risk losing that type of richness
dannysullivan	696053668232065024	2016-02-06T19:31:41	My RIPTwitter story explains why, ironically, optional algo Twitter timeline would make easier to find top tweets

dannysullivan	696048281143480320	2016-02-06T19:10:16	mathewi long-term, anything could happen. and long-term, it might even be what users want. i just don't see it as an instant change
dannysullivan	696048122812731393	2016-02-06T19:09:39	mathewi I'd be incredibly surprised if they changed the default. Stunned. I don't see that happening in short to medium term
dannysullivan	696047036039196672	2016-02-06T19:05:19	Short of official Twitter comment, major investor Sacca saying live timeline won't go should reassure RIPTwitter 
dannysullivan	696043947823489024	2016-02-06T18:53:03	iPeggy I really doubt that
dannysullivan	696040804595335168	2016-02-06T18:40:34	seo_theory this is likely different than that
dannysullivan	696037660230492161	2016-02-06T18:28:04	marktraphagen people would be so much more reassured if they new this would be optional. that seems the key thing right now

dannysullivan	696033512776814593	2016-02-06T18:11:35	fqure mathewi we assume it will be. but twitter hasn't said this itself, and that's fueling the freakout
dannysullivan	696032242527670274	2016-02-06T18:06:32	AdamSinger thanks!
dannysullivan	696032095647326208	2016-02-06T18:05:57	Twitter going into what should be one of its biggest days of the year, SB50, with RIPTwitter trending is awful. Get damage control going.
dannysullivan	696031670705606656	2016-02-06T18:04:16	Amazed Twitter not said timeline change likely optional re: RIPTwitter. Jack tweeted soon after long tweet worries. WheresJack now?
dannysullivan	696030373193469952	2016-02-06T17:59:07	mjfears JeffCarnage better than a typo that requires either deleting a tweet or living with it. i think within a short period, would be ok
dannysullivan	696029213439098880	2016-02-06T17:54:30	My RIPTwitter story also suggests how live, algorithmic and image timeline could live side-by-side, a swipe away

dannysullivan	695901069356826624	2016-02-06T09:25:18	JeffCarnage you could limit changes to say the first minute five minutes 10 minutes. many people just want to fix a typo
dannysullivan	695893585166598152	2016-02-06T08:55:34	Fascinating how many tweets about RIPTwitter are saying what they really want is an edit button. Agreed, just do it already, Twitter.
dannysullivan	695892224429527044	2016-02-06T08:50:10	AndyCole84 doesn't change ad game. does indeed give more control over what's seen. there's good and bad with that. If option, less worry
dannysullivan	695891936868114432	2016-02-06T08:49:01	If you want tiny sense of what algorithmic Twitter might give you, sign up for nuzzel. It's great. As option, good for Twitter to offer
dannysullivan	695891270502215680	2016-02-06T08:46:22	steveplunkett yes but people have to actively go there. An algo timeline would be the best from all you follow on all topics
dannysullivan	695891054097137664	2016-02-06T08:45:30	AndyCole84 Twitter already does this now. An algorithmic timeline doesn't change that. It's simply an assumption that new people may like
dannysullivan	695890641893462016	2016-02-06T08:43:52	Key is that Twitter needs to protect "live" stream even if it adds "DVR" option. More in my past story  RIPTwitter

dannysullivan	695887774990278656	2016-02-06T08:32:29	adamk678 clearly a few others did too. Hopefully what I just tweeted helps
dannysullivan	695887629519159296	2016-02-06T08:31:54	Timeline under pressure to change because assumption Twitter is broken. RIPTwitter trending shows LOTS of Twitter users disagree.
dannysullivan	695886686996160512	2016-02-06T08:28:09	delwilliams that's entirely what it's about. But the timeline is under pressure to change because if investor views Twitter is broken
dannysullivan	695886476421132288	2016-02-06T08:27:19	adamk678 people don't want the timeline to change. Twitter is think to change it because investors assume it's broken &amp; fewer using it
dannysullivan	695886167405821953	2016-02-06T08:26:05	fanoonman I know what they're about. And the reason Twitter might make that change is in part from the idea supposedly fewer use Twitter
dannysullivan	695873954271989761	2016-02-06T07:37:34	drezac I think sure show people what you value about it

dannysullivan	695858120741023744	2016-02-06T06:34:39	I also don't think Twitter's dying. I just think it's incredibly tough to have the revenues that match Facebook. Different businesses now.
dannysullivan	695857973059411968	2016-02-06T06:34:03	Anyway, I thought last weekend was diagnose everything wrong with Twitter to keep it from dying weekend. I guess we get a repeat.

dannysullivan	695857122685267968	2016-02-06T06:30:41	Do strongly agree Twitter could do more to help newbies have great feeds, like following interests not people 
dannysullivan	695856589790531584	2016-02-06T06:28:34	By the way, I don't buy in that much into the "Twitter should be easier" argument as a big fault. Otherwise, how do you explain Snapchat?
dannysullivan	695855501184102401	2016-02-06T06:24:14	swaaanson swipe again maybe to see only images, effective twittergram. and i'd be integrating the ads more into everything
dannysullivan	695855374478344192	2016-02-06T06:23:44	swaaanson might make app more swipeable like snapchat, swipe right to easily see latest trends, swipe again for top tweets
dannysullivan	695855093204123648	2016-02-06T06:22:37	swaaanson heh. wish i were smart enough to know. i also think it's very hard to second guess when you're not internal to the service. but..

dannysullivan	693146790862856193	2016-01-29T19:00:47	BrandonLive OK. I'm pretty much done. You asked why I find bad with it. I told you. I'm not interested in arguing it further.
dannysullivan	693146659207778304	2016-01-29T19:00:16	BrandonLive if I could get the tablet off, I could plug the charger into that -- like, you know, i can do with an iPad. it's a flaw.
dannysullivan	693146562558607360	2016-01-29T18:59:53	BrandonLive no brandon, i don't. it's not like it tells you that. all I know is that I can't detach the tablet which I could run separately
dannysullivan	693146376973062144	2016-01-29T18:59:08	BrandonLive i've seen others also say the trackpad is bad. just because it's big and glass doesn't mean it's necessarily good.
dannysullivan	693146267803713536	2016-01-29T18:58:42	BrandonLive of course it's objectively false. trackpad responsiveness is subjective. we all perceive it differently. for me, it's awful
dannysullivan	693146054842126338	2016-01-29T18:57:52	BrandonLive the tablet won't detach if it has like 10% or less power. that's not a "dead" tablet. that's a tablet running low on power
dannysullivan	693145956141772801	2016-01-29T18:57:28	BrandonLive it's supposed to also be a tablet. if I can't detach the tablet because it decides it doesn't have enough power, that's a waste
dannysullivan	693145479727566848	2016-01-29T18:55:35	BrandonLive it is not the best trackpad around. it just the same old terrible trackpad windows laptops usually have. my take.
dannysullivan	693145304716083201	2016-01-29T18:54:53	BrandonLive you're mileage may vary and if so, cool. but that's my take. i wouldn't recommend anyone buy this. a regular Surface, sure.
dannysullivan	693145177225957377	2016-01-29T18:54:22	BrandonLive In short, the MacBook remains a far better computer for me. Even my Surface 3 is much better than this disaster that is SB
dannysullivan	693145023978704896	2016-01-29T18:53:46	BrandonLive  5) weird situation of changing resolution but separately having to change size of individual items is a mess
dannysullivan	693144913265848320	2016-01-29T18:53:19	BrandonLive  3) have to remember weird key combination to dim the screen 4) no mechanical detach of screen mean low power sticks it there
dannysullivan	693144723691692032	2016-01-29T18:52:34	BrandonLive  1) trackpad is terrible, to the point I touch the screen 2) can't trust it to sleep without losing power
dannysullivan	693143590575288321	2016-01-29T18:48:04	BrandonLive the problem is that it's a crap laptop. Sorry, but it is. Pity, because the potential is there. Maybe SB2 will be better

dannysullivan	690657505974681600	2016-01-22T22:09:15	miriamgottfried still i never am going to be convinced the NYT or WSJ should charge me more to read on a tablet vs my smartphone. ugh.
dannysullivan	690657389595328512	2016-01-22T22:08:48	miriamgottfried IE, NYT &amp; WSJ have enough readers at higher prices that may not be worth messing with even if some find it odd
dannysullivan	690657187274723329	2016-01-22T22:07:59	miriamgottfried just not a lot of innovation, in my view, when comes to digital pricing. for some required reading pubs, might be ok
dannysullivan	690656949600301056	2016-01-22T22:07:03	miriamgottfried lower digital prices could keep the WSJ going if they attracted more readers who balk at the higher price.
dannysullivan	690656811469279232	2016-01-22T22:06:30	miriamgottfried there are times when my print editions of the WSJ might stack up unread. yet i’m more “valuable” as a print reader :)
dannysullivan	690656701972766720	2016-01-22T22:06:04	miriamgottfried the value of a print ad has traditionally been look these 1 million people all see your ads. they don’t.
dannysullivan	690656475400638465	2016-01-22T22:05:10	raju it does except not valid for renewals. my similar offer from last year just expired. but ultimately, they split the difference
dannysullivan	690656221477470208	2016-01-22T22:04:09	miriamgottfried but most WSJ readers probably don’t care. business expense or don’t care about $200 more overall. my cheap upbringing :)
dannysullivan	690656074400067588	2016-01-22T22:03:34	miriamgottfried it’s why newspapers are in the mess they’re in, failing to wean off print. reasonable digital pricing would help
dannysullivan	690655989696049152	2016-01-22T22:03:14	miriamgottfried and that’s all built on a fiction that the ad sales folks have built on how valuable those print ads supposedly are
dannysullivan	690655885551468545	2016-01-22T22:02:49	miriamgottfried i know. it just irks me. print subscribers have long been subsidized. digital ones expected to pay full rate….
dannysullivan	690655358340042752	2016-01-22T22:00:43	chiropractic WSJ has great content. Worth supporting. I just balk at being told something that’s all digital is nearly same cost as paper
dannysullivan	690655174667333632	2016-01-22T22:00:00	miriamgottfried lucrative just but as ignored :)
dannysullivan	690654776594268160	2016-01-22T21:58:25	Like NYT, WSJ has crazy pricing. All digital $347 per year, only $40 less than having physical paper delivered

dannysullivan	682439040629633024	2015-12-31T05:52:01	shearm yeah, that's nice. I can do that for Android Wear, too. But this is really down to Lorna getting one this week &amp; asking why so crap
