AlexRubalcava	697386048817491969	2016-02-10T11:46:05	Right on schedule! iPhone camera doesn't do it justice. 
AlexRubalcava	697383805653377024	2016-02-10T11:37:10	T minus 3 minutes. Anyone else in California up for the launch?
AlexRubalcava	697319589617664000	2016-02-10T07:22:00	AlexRubalcava Do an asset swap. Take HCG, Jian Ghomeshi and the Rogers family

AlexRubalcava	697266543743234049	2016-02-10T03:51:13	This is the rocket launching tonight at 3:39 AM from Vandenberg. You can see why the view could be spectacular. 
AlexRubalcava	697263793923952640	2016-02-10T03:40:17	Here‚Äôs the info on the launch. It could be spectacular. 
AlexRubalcava	697263654912135169	2016-02-10T03:39:44	If you‚Äôre in California tonight, set your alarm for 3:30 AM and look outside. If it‚Äôs clear, go outside and try to watch the rocket launch.
AlexRubalcava	697243458361118720	2016-02-10T02:19:29	New Hampshire is why we can‚Äôt have nice things.
AlexRubalcava	697098155985219584	2016-02-09T16:42:06	In Britain, they were called rotten boroughs.   In America, we call them Iowa and New Hampshire.

AlexRubalcava	697002488969297920	2016-02-09T10:21:57	MrRowD valuetakes did Google have global scale that early? All their early revenue sources were concentrated in the US, no?
AlexRubalcava	697002010814459904	2016-02-09T10:20:03	MrRowD valuetakes putting PageRank and Applied Semantics together was like uniting the Keymaster and the Gatekeeper in Ghostbusters.
AlexRubalcava	697000879895896064	2016-02-09T10:15:34	One of the better discussion I've had on Twitter in quite some time.   
AlexRubalcava	697000379645464576	2016-02-09T10:13:34	MrRowD valuetakes yes they bought AS when it was much smaller than Overture. But Yahoo had to marry Overture to its inferior search.
AlexRubalcava	696998318665109504	2016-02-09T10:05:23	MrRowD valuetakes the search ad business, invented by Overture and Applied Semantics, had and continues to have strong network effects.
AlexRubalcava	696997512096317441	2016-02-09T10:02:11	valuetakes MrRowD with some good K Street lobbying it might even be something like a REIT that owns the cars.
AlexRubalcava	696997383473762305	2016-02-09T10:01:40	valuetakes MrRowD the vehicle, like the hotel, will be owned by an asset heavy company specializing in that.
AlexRubalcava	696997199226413057	2016-02-09T10:00:56	valuetakes MrRowD the software company will be like the hotel management company. High margin consumer brand.
AlexRubalcava	696997071438524417	2016-02-09T10:00:26	valuetakes MrRowD yep. I think autonomous ride cars will be organized like a hotel.
AlexRubalcava	696996861488418816	2016-02-09T09:59:36	MrRowD you're pretty thoughtful for an egg account.
AlexRubalcava	696996621360312320	2016-02-09T09:58:38	valuetakes MrRowD it's so commoditized that everyone on the planet can see that one day soon there won't even be a driver.
AlexRubalcava	696996361091227649	2016-02-09T09:57:36	MrRowD valuetakes Google built its revenue engine in the US. And dial up like AOL had already abandoned hourly pricing years before that.
AlexRubalcava	696995904927059968	2016-02-09T09:55:47	MrRowD dolomost valuetakes really? Ask the cab companies about that one.
AlexRubalcava	696995809770901505	2016-02-09T09:55:25	valuetakes MrRowD with messaging you talk to the same people on the platform all the time. I never want to request the same uber driver.
AlexRubalcava	696995546163056640	2016-02-09T09:54:22	MrRowD valuetakes and the wisdom to recognize that Overture and Applied Semantics developed one of the best biz models of all time.
AlexRubalcava	696995317288292352	2016-02-09T09:53:27	MrRowD valuetakes there was algorithmic search long before Google. Remember altavista? Google just had a better algorithm in PageRank.
AlexRubalcava	696994756832833536	2016-02-09T09:51:14	dolomost MrRowD valuetakes the regulatory groundwork laid by Uber will benefit everyone who comes after them.
AlexRubalcava	696994352963268608	2016-02-09T09:49:37	valuetakes MrRowD FB: social networking, messaging, mobile first orientation. TL;DR: the whole company.
AlexRubalcava	696994175674286080	2016-02-09T09:48:55	valuetakes MrRowD GOOG: the concept of a search engine, auction pricing of search-related ads, smartphone OS. TL;DR: the whole company.
AlexRubalcava	696993874086985729	2016-02-09T09:47:43	valuetakes MrRowD AAPL: GUI, desktop publishing, MP3 player, smartphone, tablet. TL;DR: the whole company
AlexRubalcava	696992255207305217	2016-02-09T09:41:17	valuetakes MrRowD it wouldn't surprise me to see wild shifts in market share in ride hailing.
AlexRubalcava	696991048954998784	2016-02-09T09:36:30	Interesting conversation on network effects, Uber 
AlexRubalcava	696991066948444160	2016-02-09T09:36:34	MrRowD valuetakes I am saying the same thing but drawing a different conclusion.
AlexRubalcava	696990934609711104	2016-02-09T09:36:02	valuetakes MrRowD for $60b? If they wanted FB could probably compete and take 33% of Uber's business for $1b of R&amp;D &amp; marketing cost.
AlexRubalcava	696990477162147841	2016-02-09T09:34:13	MrRowD valuetakes yes we are talking cost structure. What was expensive to build for uber will be cheap for the next guy to build.
AlexRubalcava	696990294797996032	2016-02-09T09:33:30	valuetakes MrRowD uber had to teach us all, one by one, about this new thing, this new behavior. But now we all know.
AlexRubalcava	696989914341072896	2016-02-09T09:31:59	valuetakes MrRowD and a customer that was expensive for uber to acquire in 2013 will be cheap for the next app to acquire in 2018.
AlexRubalcava	696989722099363840	2016-02-09T09:31:13	valuetakes MrRowD the barrier here isn't new technology. It's customer acquisition cost.
AlexRubalcava	696989508907065344	2016-02-09T09:30:23	valuetakes MrRowD Apple, Google or Facebook could add rides to their maps and messaging apps with almost zero $ invested.
AlexRubalcava	696989166953869312	2016-02-09T09:29:01	valuetakes MrRowD it's not about import. It's about putting another app on the phones of drivers and riders.
AlexRubalcava	696989004298739713	2016-02-09T09:28:22	valuetakes MrRowD when served by software and machine learning tools, what was hard for a human-based system becomes easy.
AlexRubalcava	696988806067531776	2016-02-09T09:27:35	valuetakes MrRowD cab rides were local monopolies because dispatch and availability were hard problems when served by humans.
AlexRubalcava	696988407340224512	2016-02-09T09:26:00	valuetakes MrRowD while Uber brokers only one thing.
AlexRubalcava	696988345658769409	2016-02-09T09:25:45	valuetakes MrRowD it was a statement about variety of merchandise transacted over the network. EBAY transacts millions of things.
AlexRubalcava	696988145598922752	2016-02-09T09:24:57	valuetakes MrRowD the statement was not about market size. If anything EBAY serves a rather slow growing market.
AlexRubalcava	696987719516336128	2016-02-09T09:23:16	valuetakes MrRowD the greater the variety of things transacted over a network, the more value the network has over the things themselves.
AlexRubalcava	696987362551660545	2016-02-09T09:21:51	valuetakes MrRowD all stuff are different. All rides are nearly identical.
AlexRubalcava	696987244653973504	2016-02-09T09:21:23	valuetakes MrRowD there are like what, 3 orders of magnitude, between what is encompassed by the words "stuff" and "rides."
AlexRubalcava	696986720395403264	2016-02-09T09:19:18	MrRowD valuetakes you cannot simply say "network effects" without taking into consideration the difference between marketplaces.
AlexRubalcava	696986427066683392	2016-02-09T09:18:08	valuetakes MrRowD but ebay is completely different. They make a market in millions of SKUs. Uber provides one fungible service.
AlexRubalcava	696985788320391168	2016-02-09T09:15:35	valuetakes MrRowD and there is no straightforward way for Uber to crush potential new entrants in years to come.
AlexRubalcava	696985588147224576	2016-02-09T09:14:48	valuetakes MrRowD sure uber is dominant over lyft now. But a new entrant could emerge at a fraction of the cost it took to build Uber.
AlexRubalcava	696985176434307072	2016-02-09T09:13:10	valuetakes MrRowD at the very least EBAY being 20 years old deserves 4x the benefit of the doubt vs 5 year old uber.
AlexRubalcava	696984601764372480	2016-02-09T09:10:53	MrRowD valuetakes even driver safety and background checks could be unbundled and provided to all rise hail services.
AlexRubalcava	696984351754432512	2016-02-09T09:09:53	MrRowD valuetakes drivers can download a new app easily and be on both simultaneously.
AlexRubalcava	696983478307434496	2016-02-09T09:06:25	valuetakes MrRowD the assets are mobile, the trips are fungible, the need for trust beyond basic safety is zero. No switching cost.
AlexRubalcava	696983277492568068	2016-02-09T09:05:37	valuetakes MrRowD any company with a widely distributed app could compete with Uber overnight with a simple software update.
AlexRubalcava	696982825547886592	2016-02-09T09:03:49	valuetakes MrRowD I think Uber has nearly zero network effect. Switching cost is precisely zero.
AlexRubalcava	696974544112726016	2016-02-09T08:30:55	As will this one for CRISPR. 
AlexRubalcava	696974258015055874	2016-02-09T08:29:46	Prediction: this Google Trends chart for ‚Äúgene drive‚Äù is going to go explosively vertical in 2016.

AlexRubalcava	696956889926467584	2016-02-09T07:20:46	My response: 5 years into the Web 1.0 era, YHOO had a commanding lead in Internet search.
AlexRubalcava	696956620467601408	2016-02-09T07:19:41	A friend was talking to me about Uber's dominance of ride hailing today. He argued their lead is insurmountable.

AlexRubalcava	696949513370673152	2016-02-09T06:51:27	EricJorgenson dasan conorsen Yep. There‚Äôs few business plans more aggressive than staking the company on a single capex project.
AlexRubalcava	696897262996180993	2016-02-09T03:23:49	BrattleStCap the assets are necessary and valuable. The structure is slimy and rife with weak governance.
AlexRubalcava	696892676445081600	2016-02-09T03:05:36	IgorGreenwald adoxen All true. Pity about that horrible, slimy corporate structure that got inserted into an otherwise respectable biz.

AlexRubalcava	696854513597042688	2016-02-09T00:33:57	dasan conorsen given the capex needs of their business plan, that $465mm loan was kind of a rounding error, no?
AlexRubalcava	696852264510627840	2016-02-09T00:25:01	dasan conorsen they could have pre-funded an even more insanely aggressive business plan at very low cost.
AlexRubalcava	696852109879177217	2016-02-09T00:24:24	dasan conorsen it really mystifies me why TSLA didn't use more stock in recent years with price above $200.
AlexRubalcava	696850904859869185	2016-02-09T00:19:37	dasan conorsen yes, I think market share potential is a much better reason to be skeptical of TSLA.
AlexRubalcava	696849949980385280	2016-02-09T00:15:49	dasan conorsen I think there are 130k buyers/year globally willing to make a fashion statement even if gasoline cost zero.

AlexRubalcava	696122536510095361	2016-02-07T00:05:20	nachkari Right. Load factors are going to go way up. And commuting AV cars aren‚Äôt going to be 4-seaters.

AlexRubalcava	696121094600667136	2016-02-06T23:59:36	nachkari For that to be true, legacy rail would have to be better/cheaper/faster than AVs for all but last mile in big cities.

AlexRubalcava	696117765690687488	2016-02-06T23:46:23	nachkari It puts one legacy asset, roads, at such a massive advantage that the other legacy system, rails, will disappear.
AlexRubalcava	696117650095648768	2016-02-06T23:45:55	nachkari The new reality ‚Äî humans don‚Äôt have to operate the vehicles ‚Äî increases road carrying capacity SO MUCH that rail cannot compete.

AlexRubalcava	696116693802745856	2016-02-06T23:42:07	nachkari Which is why I don‚Äôt think we should build any more infrastructure with today‚Äôs costs/scarcities/constraints as key assumptions.
AlexRubalcava	696116534217801729	2016-02-06T23:41:29	nachkari The entire system we have is built on implied costs, scarcities, and constraints. Much/all of that changes in an AV world.
AlexRubalcava	696116313706475521	2016-02-06T23:40:37	nachkari The relative volumes on certain corridors are artifacts of current systems &amp; constraints. Those will change.
AlexRubalcava	696116023674580992	2016-02-06T23:39:27	nachkari The ability to build something like this is only emerging as we speak.

AlexRubalcava	696115745600606209	2016-02-06T23:38:21	The_Analyst DavidSchawel ReformedBroker Well, I wouldn‚Äôt put it past the doofi at Market Street to try, so we may get a chance to see.
AlexRubalcava	696115430880968704	2016-02-06T23:37:06	nachkari That‚Äôs easy to fix and will be a rounding error compared to the savings enabled by AVs.
AlexRubalcava	696114777601368064	2016-02-06T23:34:30	nachkari AV = rail cost/mile &amp; rider density, but to and from anywhere. It will completely, utterly destroy the use case for urban rail.
AlexRubalcava	696114414294953984	2016-02-06T23:33:04	nachkari Imagine that same GIF, but instead of a trolley on rails, you have a large AV van.
AlexRubalcava	696114186657488896	2016-02-06T23:32:09	nachkari Shared ride AVs will be point-to-point cheaper and faster than rail. So why would someone ever take rail?
AlexRubalcava	696113935649386496	2016-02-06T23:31:10	DavidSchawel ReformedBroker The_Analyst Tech history is littered with the corpses of companies that closed APIs &amp; shredded platform value
AlexRubalcava	696113685450723329	2016-02-06T23:30:10	nachkari I think rail will be a stranded asset very, very quickly in the AV age.
AlexRubalcava	696113528004935680	2016-02-06T23:29:32	nachkari Peak capacity will be so much higher with shared ride, tighter spacing AVs that I think all prior assumptions are moot.
AlexRubalcava	696113195266609152	2016-02-06T23:28:13	DavidSchawel ReformedBroker The_Analyst Right, but Tweetdeck is simple to build. The moment TWTR charges for it, they‚Äôll be undercut.
AlexRubalcava	696112749512781824	2016-02-06T23:26:27	At this point, we should be directing capex decisions with AVs in mind. Finish all in-progress light rail lines, don‚Äôt start any new ones
AlexRubalcava	696111809833488384	2016-02-06T23:22:43	Examples like this are why, with  AVs coming, I‚Äôm growing skeptical about further investments in light rail. 
AlexRubalcava	696110609461415937	2016-02-06T23:17:57	ReformedBroker The_Analyst The game theory suggests Tweetdeck should always be free. But with TWTR mgmt, I assume no rationality.
AlexRubalcava	696110145768542208	2016-02-06T23:16:06	ReformedBroker The_Analyst Right, but the moment you close off API access, you reduce the value of your platform.
AlexRubalcava	696110010170888196	2016-02-06T23:15:34	The_Analyst ReformedBroker That‚Äôs the point. Keeping it free dissuades competition. Once you start charging, game changes.
AlexRubalcava	696109656108761093	2016-02-06T23:14:09	The_Analyst ReformedBroker If Tweetdeck cost $10/m, it would take a week or two for an identical product to come out for $1, 1 time cost.

AlexRubalcava	694052024229298177	2016-02-01T06:57:52	15/n by conducting all the interviews in a state like New York where you can be filmed &amp; broadcast in your own office without your consent.
AlexRubalcava	694051820197384192	2016-02-01T06:57:03	14/n Just as the hypothetical client in the 60Minutes story were shopping jurisdictions, 60Minutes itself was shopping for jurisdiction...
AlexRubalcava	694051564470665216	2016-02-01T06:56:02	13/n Luckily, I live in California, where all-party consent is required for the use of hidden camera footage. 
AlexRubalcava	694051360510054400	2016-02-01T06:55:13	12/n And then 60Minutes basically calls you corrupt because you didn‚Äôt tell the person to get out of your office.

AlexRubalcava	694050837211918336	2016-02-01T06:53:09	10/n I listen and act professionally, and then discreetly pass later. For all we know, that‚Äôs what these lawyers on 60Minutes did.

AlexRubalcava	694050390329860096	2016-02-01T06:51:22	8/n Any professional has listened to absurd or immoral ideas presented by people who want to do business with you, like on 60Minutes today.
AlexRubalcava	694049943057596418	2016-02-01T06:49:35	7/n FCPA applies to American citizens, corporations, and issuers of securities. Not to people in foreign countries.
AlexRubalcava	694049564366499840	2016-02-01T06:48:05	6/n But on 60Minutes tape, the undercover guy says neither payor nor payee of the hypothetical graft were Americans. So, FCPA irrelevant.
AlexRubalcava	694049342861111296	2016-02-01T06:47:12	5/n The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was mentioned in the 60Minutes piece.
AlexRubalcava	694048908985528320	2016-02-01T06:45:29	4/n None of the lawyers in 60Minutes sent engagement letters. None billed for any time. None performed any work.
AlexRubalcava	694048688956542976	2016-02-01T06:44:36	3/n See here for NY law: 
AlexRubalcava	694048505652912128	2016-02-01T06:43:53	2/n 60Minutes were careful to note that all the conversations happened in NY, where only 1-party consent is needed for secret cameras.
AlexRubalcava	694047933243625472	2016-02-01T06:41:36	1/n That 60Minutes piece on supposed money laundering was absurdly poor journalism.

AlexRubalcava	692547031076884481	2016-01-28T03:17:33	dasan Heart counts for so much, doesn‚Äôt it? I can never imagine Ack resting on his laurels.
AlexRubalcava	692546646501150720	2016-01-28T03:16:02	dasan Remember the gold trade? Various bets in energy? It‚Äôs been a tough run over the last decade.
AlexRubalcava	692546462559895555	2016-01-28T03:15:18	dasan Yes, the model works and every time people count Ackman out, he works his way out of the box. His resiliency is admirable.
AlexRubalcava	692545104641392641	2016-01-28T03:09:54	dasan Greenlight‚Äôs track record is heavily skewed by strong early years when AUM was lower. Last decade or so, pretty average.
AlexRubalcava	692544944544858113	2016-01-28T03:09:16	dasan My view is less on individual investments, more on the fact that Ack has continued to put up good years as AUM scaled.

AlexRubalcava	690634905445801984	2016-01-22T20:39:27	davidmanheim Yes, I see that a lot in south central and East LA. Motivated kids take classes at cc when high schools don‚Äôt offer enough.
AlexRubalcava	690634317496586240	2016-01-22T20:37:07	davidmanheim and the kids in those 5 schools could form a classroom two days a week with AV transport.
AlexRubalcava	690634237704155136	2016-01-22T20:36:48	davidmanheim i.e. no one high school has enough demand for super advanced math beyond trad APs. But 5 schools might.
AlexRubalcava	690634072918360064	2016-01-22T20:36:09	davidmanheim schools will be able to offer much higher resolution in curriculum, b/c they can aggregate more demand.

AlexRubalcava	690393892508798976	2016-01-22T04:41:45	DK2939 as AVs approach 100% penetration, I think stop signs and signals will be removed. Maybe bare intersections, maybe traffic circles?
AlexRubalcava	690393598009933827	2016-01-22T04:40:35	DK2939 load factors will change the most in urban areas so the effect will be strongest there.

AlexRubalcava	690386557681975297	2016-01-22T04:12:36	DK2939 I don't think they will increase road congestion b/c of higher load factors, better driving (platooning), reduced parking need, etc

AlexRubalcava	690384320750587904	2016-01-22T04:03:43	DK2939 Agreed. I think we should put a pause on public transport projects that would go into service after 2025.
AlexRubalcava	690384024871768065	2016-01-22T04:02:32	BlairReeves Agreed. Good charter law allow all of those reforms (and more) to be implemented in ways that aren‚Äôt possible in legacy system.
AlexRubalcava	690383494309134346	2016-01-22T04:00:26	BlairReeves Since you care about education, you might consider serving on the board of a local charter. I have and it‚Äôs rewarding work.
AlexRubalcava	690382732162134018	2016-01-22T03:57:24	BlairReeves Closing bad schools, and opening new campuses of schools that succeed, does in fact solve the problem.
AlexRubalcava	690382593934639104	2016-01-22T03:56:51	BlairReeves But those disparities have shrunk tremendously because of all the strong charters opened in low income communities recently.
AlexRubalcava	690382461411393536	2016-01-22T03:56:20	BlairReeves Depends on district size. LAUSD where I live is enormous, with huge quality disparities.
AlexRubalcava	690381958577274883	2016-01-22T03:54:20	BlairReeves We should have public schools opening, growing, &amp; creating new campuses based on success. And we should shrink &amp; close failures
AlexRubalcava	690381720688988161	2016-01-22T03:53:23	BlairReeves Charter schools are public schools. And many of the crappy zip code schools should have been shut down long ago.

AlexRubalcava	690380962379780096	2016-01-22T03:50:22	So many of the limitations to school choice are limitations of geography. Limitations that will be nearly eliminated by AVs.
AlexRubalcava	690380818418683905	2016-01-22T03:49:48	By the way, autonomous vehicles are going to make school choice an even more interesting political issue than it is now.

AlexRubalcava	688184656508764160	2016-01-16T02:23:02	evoinvitro jordanbrianl austinklee interesting. Single game fees would work for football and for other sports' playoffs. Regular season?
AlexRubalcava	688184099282890752	2016-01-16T02:20:49	jordanbrianl evoinvitro austinklee like in every other aspect, the NCAA is anachronistic, brittle, fragile when it comes to TV.
AlexRubalcava	688183789818789889	2016-01-16T02:19:35	evoinvitro jordanbrianl austinklee maybe $50/season for tier 2 sports. $150 for football?
AlexRubalcava	688183224355311616	2016-01-16T02:17:21	evoinvitro jordanbrianl austinklee my guess: fewer than 15 million subs for all but the two football leagues.
AlexRubalcava	688182022016110593	2016-01-16T02:12:34	austinklee evoinvitro jordanbrianl Yep. Their big LA studio is just down the block from me. Constant activity there.

AlexRubalcava	688181610651385858	2016-01-16T02:10:56	jordanbrianl evoinvitro austinklee FB will be interesting. The most they‚Äôve ever been able to charge users is $1/year for WhatsApp right?
AlexRubalcava	688180643906228225	2016-01-16T02:07:05	evoinvitro jordanbrianl austinklee Yes, good point.
AlexRubalcava	688180255148781571	2016-01-16T02:05:33	jordanbrianl austinklee Yes, given the need for a deep, constantly refreshed original content library, consolidation makes sense.
AlexRubalcava	688179067011477504	2016-01-16T02:00:49	jordanbrianl austinklee My guess: Netflix and Prime will be # 1 and 2 media outlets in 10 years. But # 3-10 haven‚Äôt been founded yet.
AlexRubalcava	688178596884525061	2016-01-16T01:58:57	jordanbrianl austinklee HBO ‚Äî dependent on legacy movie release window and hits-driven shows with far fewer hours of content than Netflix.
AlexRubalcava	688178379015622656	2016-01-16T01:58:05	jordanbrianl austinklee Hulu‚Äôs content ‚Äî no one under 30 cares. ESPN ‚Äî 5+ sports bundled, when most fans follow about 1-2.
AlexRubalcava	688177986466656256	2016-01-16T01:56:32	jordanbrianl austinklee I doubt their price points, content access, and economic models will last.
AlexRubalcava	688177890941206529	2016-01-16T01:56:09	jordanbrianl austinklee Sure. But at least three of those (HBO, Hulu, ESPN) are rear-guard attempts to protect a status quo.
AlexRubalcava	688176613364613130	2016-01-16T01:51:04	jordanbrianl austinklee I think the chance that one company controls all OTT sports rights is pretty low.
AlexRubalcava	688175696166780928	2016-01-16T01:47:26	jordanbrianl austinklee How many sports do you watch? All 4 major pro + college FB? Or fewer?
AlexRubalcava	688175473902383104	2016-01-16T01:46:33	jordanbrianl austinklee and because Amazon will be one of the winners, and they will force their margin structure onto their competitors.
AlexRubalcava	688175385163370503	2016-01-16T01:46:12	jordanbrianl austinklee My view: OTT pricing power will be constrained by sheer number of services...
AlexRubalcava	688174830005256193	2016-01-16T01:43:59	austinklee jordanbrianl No doubt there‚Äôs millions of fans. But the bundle serves everyone poorly, except people who like all 4 sports.
