carolrosenberg	703313018067804161	2016-02-26T20:17:45	Bormann says basically, draw the line over there with no touching for transport, and sits down.

carolrosenberg	703312440021360640	2016-02-26T20:15:27	But, says Pohl, it ends there. Bormann: If SecDef can choose the chief trial judge, he can un-choose him. Pohl: See me if that happens.
carolrosenberg	703312162022957056	2016-02-26T20:14:20	Attorney Bormann tells Judge Pohl he's definitely in Sec Def Carter's chain of command. Quotes rule that Sec Def chooses chief trial judge.

carolrosenberg	703311389323042816	2016-02-26T20:11:16	Nevin also tosses in that KSM doesn't want no female guards, no female tier supes, etc., never sought that. Just not to be touched by them.
carolrosenberg	703311159500345344	2016-02-26T20:10:21	Nevin clarifies: "The sexualized touching took place in the Black Sites." Female touching here "recapulates that."
carolrosenberg	703310624307191808	2016-02-26T20:08:14	Now, he says, "for first time in years" the detainees are "having women lay hands on these detainees ... against their will."

carolrosenberg	703307768262991873	2016-02-26T19:56:53	Judge Pohl asks if there's been a clarification or retraction by the Pentagon of "intemperate remarks"? Swann to judge: No.
carolrosenberg	703307584862855168	2016-02-26T19:56:09	"They were not directed at you to make a decision at this case," says Swann. They were "simply addressing a senator's question."
carolrosenberg	703307464968634369	2016-02-26T19:55:41	Swann on the "outrageous" characterizations of Judge Pohl's TRO: "They should not have been made" but says...
carolrosenberg	703307177616871425	2016-02-26T19:54:32	Swann adds that Ash Carter thought a federal judge did it. Pohl interrupts: It would've been OK aimed at a federal judge?
carolrosenberg	703306782257631232	2016-02-26T19:52:58	Swann on "outrageous," notes Gen. John Kelly who first characterized Judge Pohl's order as outrageous is no longer in the military, retired.
carolrosenberg	703306586270334976	2016-02-26T19:52:11	Swann says defense didn't meet UI burden: "All the order did was protect the defense's ability to make argument and present evidence."
carolrosenberg	703306340970700800	2016-02-26T19:51:13	Swann says Defense got it wrong on 8th Amendment; otherwise they could blame all sorts of things on "what happened in the black sites.'
carolrosenberg	703305855077371904	2016-02-26T19:49:17	Swann invokes "the late great Justice Scalia," and calls the Defense argument "pure apple sauce."
carolrosenberg	703305737343209472	2016-02-26T19:48:49	Swann says the female guards aren't touching the captives' genitals or buttocks, says there's nothing sexualized about it.
carolrosenberg	703305560406499328	2016-02-26T19:48:07	Prosecutor Swann says defense claim that female guard touching for transport is cruel and unusual is as "inexplicable as it is unexplained."
carolrosenberg	703304769834762240	2016-02-26T19:44:58	Swann says Pohl is already providing religious accommodation, doesn't hold hearings during Ramadan.
carolrosenberg	703304493346197504	2016-02-26T19:43:52	Swann adds, "How long is that going to last until the word gets out?" He thinks other detainees won't want women touching them either.
carolrosenberg	703304396361355264	2016-02-26T19:43:29	Swann sees it as much broader than the 5 detainees at issue here: They want to tell the decision makers don't bother to send females here.
carolrosenberg	703304122527825920	2016-02-26T19:42:24	Swann says no female guard touching of HVDs limits JTF flexibility, adds that, overall, 17 percent of all Army MPs are females.
carolrosenberg	703303927098449924	2016-02-26T19:41:37	EdwinAPerry What about when he replied to Judge Pohl's question last week, framed by Cheryl Bormann as a "spectacle."
carolrosenberg	703303461085949952	2016-02-26T19:39:46	Swann said it has taken 14 months too long, female guards have been denied certain responsibilities.
carolrosenberg	703302514884661251	2016-02-26T19:36:00	Swann notes that most female guards at war court today are too young to remember 9/11.
carolrosenberg	703302435494727680	2016-02-26T19:35:42	Prosecutor Swann calls Guantanamo an "exceptionally well run first class facility."
carolrosenberg	703302113623973888	2016-02-26T19:34:25	He reminds that, under TRO, male guards became resentful because they had to "absorb the responsibilities" of their female counterparts.
carolrosenberg	703301871574896640	2016-02-26T19:33:27	Swann says the female guard restrictions are: "No frisks and no watching the detainees while they are in their individual showers."
carolrosenberg	703301583732350976	2016-02-26T19:32:18	Swann is disputing that this is intentional, invokes testimony that order damaged Camp 7 "overall readiness, morale and personal dignity."
carolrosenberg	703300987453378564	2016-02-26T19:29:56	Swann quotes testimony of damage to Guantanamo guard force morale, female officer said there was an operational need to re-balance assets.
carolrosenberg	703300539778469888	2016-02-26T19:28:10	Swann says Camp 7 functioning, no problems under TRO is a tribute to the male-female guard force stepping up in face of gender equality.
carolrosenberg	703300196017565696	2016-02-26T19:26:48	It's a movement, says Swann, "their fantasies are not a basis in reality."
carolrosenberg	703300103759466496	2016-02-26T19:26:26	Swann says Defense didn't meet burden, calls it silly to believe being touched by female guards on shoulder, head, arm, ankles risks sin.

carolrosenberg	703298110420881409	2016-02-26T19:18:30	Nevin: When your boss says something is outrageous and needs to be fixed, a reasonable member of the public is going to say, the fix is in.

carolrosenberg	703296756780503040	2016-02-26T19:13:08	Seeger says West Point plebes are expected to be aware of current events. Judge Pohl: I did not go to West Point. Maj. Seeger: Nor did I.
carolrosenberg	703296563037278208	2016-02-26T19:12:21	Seeger said leaders want the order lifted. "The only way to make it right is to go the other way," keep the other intact.
carolrosenberg	703296416114991104	2016-02-26T19:11:46	Defense lawyer Major Seeger says the leaders' remarks do taint and bring into question the independence the war court judiciary.
carolrosenberg	703295701552402432	2016-02-26T19:08:56	Seeger: Reasonable inference. Military folks who knew hearing was pending on the issue, set up trip, appointments, including with witness.
carolrosenberg	703295449734778880	2016-02-26T19:07:56	Pohl on Sen. Ayotte female guard visit: This was some type of plan by the Department of Defense and Congress to influence me?
carolrosenberg	703295242066329600	2016-02-26T19:07:06	Seeger says SJAs are supposed to tell leaders to stick to process, not results. He cites Sen. Ayotte's visit to Gitmo ahead of testimony.
carolrosenberg	703294692901969924	2016-02-26T19:04:56	Seeger says UCI's been "intentionally and brazenly injected into this case" by Sec Def Carter, Gens. Dunford and Kelly, Sen. Ayotte, others.
carolrosenberg	703294400680611840	2016-02-26T19:03:46	Seeger says in the face of UCI, the military is obliged to identify, cure and provide remedies, says he's seen of that here.
carolrosenberg	703293845392510976	2016-02-26T19:01:33	Now for Bin Attash, Army Maj. Matt Seeger says "the system is uniquely susceptible to" Unlawful Command Influence.
carolrosenberg	703293100622520320	2016-02-26T18:58:36	Ruiz is telling Judge Pohl it's not about whether Pohl feel actual unlawful influence -- but how it looks to others in light of the history.
carolrosenberg	703292441030479872	2016-02-26T18:55:59	Ruiz says as a father of daughters he is interested in gender equality but there are also penological interests.
carolrosenberg	703290823471927296	2016-02-26T18:49:33	Ruiz is re-arguing the female touch episode disrupted attorney-client relationship, says this is of consequence to disinterested observer.
carolrosenberg	703290258885054464	2016-02-26T18:47:18	When Ash Carter declared Pohl's order "outrageous" he said he thought it was federal judge. Ruiz doesn't believe him.
carolrosenberg	703290007809826816	2016-02-26T18:46:19	Ruiz is doing appearance part, says next Pentagon brass call Pohl's no-touch order "outrageous." See story, 10/27 
carolrosenberg	703289273764728832	2016-02-26T18:43:24	Ruiz lists episodes: Prosecution raised equal opportunity, then female guards lodged EO complaints against judge, 
carolrosenberg	703288613866500097	2016-02-26T18:40:46	Hawsawi's Ruiz is doing a little tutorial on unlawful influence-- "carcinoma of military justice," not just actual but also appearance.
carolrosenberg	703288008146030592	2016-02-26T18:38:22	Ruiz tells Pohl his Jan. 7, 2015 TRO was "narrowly tailored" to legal moves. Female guards continue to move HVDs, for example, to medical.
carolrosenberg	703287304450924545	2016-02-26T18:35:34	The 911 war court hearing's resumed with Walter Ruiz, for Hawsawi, arguing female-guard motion is tainted by unlawful influence.
carolrosenberg	703286841068404736	2016-02-26T18:33:44	In case you missed: Parole board's cleared another forever prisoner. Now, 36 of the 91 at Gitmo are cleared to go. 
carolrosenberg	703284293582327808	2016-02-26T18:23:36	We're still in lunch recess. Here's your Gitmo 911trial guide, Who's Who and what's what: 
carolrosenberg	703265648500195328	2016-02-26T17:09:31	Pohl says after government argues rebuttal will be rebuttal, not repetition. And now we are in recess until 130p.
carolrosenberg	703265529792958464	2016-02-26T17:09:03	Poised for recess. Pohl says each detainee has individualized interest, he's tolerating repetitious arguments, maybe not on UI question.
carolrosenberg	703265099927126016	2016-02-26T17:07:20	"I implore you," says LTC Williams, keep the TRO, don't cause Hawsawi to risk his own sincere religious beliefs, violate various amendments.
carolrosenberg	703265041651523588	2016-02-26T17:07:06	Williams adds the MPs came up with policy to not discriminate against the women who couldn't touch detainees in their Army evaluations.
carolrosenberg	703264519573905408	2016-02-26T17:05:02	LTC Williams argues: Until Oct. 2014 there was a policy of no female touching. They found working alternatives before then and since TRO.
carolrosenberg	703263957780455424	2016-02-26T17:02:48	LTC Williams says proposal that detainees communicate in writing if they won't be touched by females would compound hard enough trial prep.
carolrosenberg	703263469353746432	2016-02-26T17:00:51	throughout the TRO experience, no female touching for more than a year, "no impact on safety and security of operations at Camp 7."
carolrosenberg	703263173835673600	2016-02-26T16:59:41	LTC Williams says JDG Col Heath might have been legitimately worried about impact of the no-touch order but, testimony showed that...
carolrosenberg	703262735019208704	2016-02-26T16:57:56	She cites Army probe found Gitmo female interrogator mock lap-danced detainees and smeared captive with fake menstrual blood.
carolrosenberg	703262483440668673	2016-02-26T16:56:56	Williams invokes one-star's Gitmo abuse investigation (when clients were in black sites) that showed interrogators used sexualized abuse.
carolrosenberg	703262156758851585	2016-02-26T16:55:38	Williams: It was non-issue for Hawsawi until 2014, when JTF implemented policy of using women for "forced physical contact" with her client.
carolrosenberg	703261878391328768	2016-02-26T16:54:32	Williams says this is about striking balance for sincere religious beliefs on inappropriateness of physical contact with non-kin women.
carolrosenberg	703261647859806208	2016-02-26T16:53:37	Now we hear from Army Lt. Col. Jennifer Williams, Hawsawi defender, calling it "not an issue of discrimination against women."
carolrosenberg	703261346985545728	2016-02-26T16:52:25	"No slippery slope," pledges Harrington, it's a specific request for a specific remedy -- no touching, not no female guards.
carolrosenberg	703261173962162180	2016-02-26T16:51:44	"We're here and this issue is real," adds Harrington, invoking civil rights era when judges had to intervene in treatment in jails.
carolrosenberg	703260899411402752	2016-02-26T16:50:39	Harrington quotes Heath calling it delay tactic but notes prosecution has conceded no-female-touching is sincere religious belief.
carolrosenberg	703260506338025472	2016-02-26T16:49:05	"We are in a bubble here," says Harrington, no court like this, world is watching, government officials are labeling things "outrageous."
carolrosenberg	703260215161053185	2016-02-26T16:47:55	Even if it didn't re-traumatize them, Harrington argues, they would object to being touched by women guards.
carolrosenberg	703259939968585728	2016-02-26T16:46:50	Now for Ramzi bin al Shibh, Jim Harrington argues a return to female guard touching will present defendants with "horrible Hobson's Choice."
carolrosenberg	703259603413409792	2016-02-26T16:45:30	Bormann also says that a return to female touching will not let him meaningfully participate in defense, "defending his life."
carolrosenberg	703259389831081984	2016-02-26T16:44:39	That's the tackle-and-shackle technique, the FCE,  that Bormann says could injure detainee or FCE-ing guards.
carolrosenberg	703259261736980480	2016-02-26T16:44:08	Bin Attash won't go voluntarily to court touched by female guard, says Bormann, will cause order for an FCE, Forced Cell Extraction...
carolrosenberg	703258962158866435	2016-02-26T16:42:57	Bormann is arguing to Judge Pohl that if he lifts the no-touch order he will create a security risk:
carolrosenberg	703258615507976192	2016-02-26T16:41:34	"This is a man who has been traumatized," says Bormann, adds forced touching re-traumatized him.
carolrosenberg	703258461329625088	2016-02-26T16:40:57	Bormann describes Bin Attash as steadfast, says he wouldn't go to at least 29 attorney-client meetings to risk "forced touching."
carolrosenberg	703257675342155780	2016-02-26T16:37:50	Bormann's showing Pohl emails her bid to get a JTF SJA meeting, calls issue "minute" in 2014, resolvable then. They don't.
carolrosenberg	703256901346263044	2016-02-26T16:34:45	Bormann says a Camp 7 unit FCE-ed him but thereafter never used females again until issue arose in 2014. Report: 
carolrosenberg	703256065702555651	2016-02-26T16:31:26	She cites single episode in 2007 at Gitmo, use of female guard escort, and Bin Attash supposedly said, "Please don't touch me; it's a sin."
carolrosenberg	703255778942128128	2016-02-26T16:30:18	At Camp 7, Bin Attash doesn't oppose the use of female guards, just being touched by them, and registered this protest in 2007.
carolrosenberg	703255397746999297	2016-02-26T16:28:47	Bormann says Bin Attash was subjected to sexually humiliation "that played on his religious beliefs as a form of torture."
carolrosenberg	703255211633188865	2016-02-26T16:28:02	In Black Sites, Bormann says Bin Attash was hung naked and interrogated by women, un-diapered to defecate on himself, make him unclean.
carolrosenberg	703254806337425408	2016-02-26T16:26:26	Bormann argues boycotting client Walid bin Attash comes from Saudi, culture that absolutely forbids physical contact with non family women.
carolrosenberg	703253923923099648	2016-02-26T16:22:55	Pohl agrees, tells her if she wants to supplement the record she'd have to file a motion.
carolrosenberg	703253773318283264	2016-02-26T16:22:20	Prosecutor Ryan's trying to block doc Bormann just produced today, declaration she says shows Bin Attash was diapered, sexually humiliating.
carolrosenberg	703252716890537985	2016-02-26T16:18:08	Next to argue: Bin Attash defender Cheryl Bormann, whose client is boycotting her, court, in modest Muslim gown, scarf.
carolrosenberg	703252375277010945	2016-02-26T16:16:46	Nevin says KSM relives his torture, wraps with a request that Pohl expand his order beyond court and legal meetings to cover all moves.
carolrosenberg	703251961257320448	2016-02-26T16:15:08	His exercise of his religion, meeting with his lawyer, and being able to come to court and meaningfully participating in his defense.
carolrosenberg	703251744361476097	2016-02-26T16:14:16	Nevin is arguing that lifting the order, returning to female guard touching would force KSM to choose between...
carolrosenberg	703251583333703682	2016-02-26T16:13:37	Back at the war court, Nevin is arguing testimony showed it's not a hardship for Camp 7 prison staff to not use female-guard touching.
carolrosenberg	703250453220433921	2016-02-26T16:09:08	Cleared captive's lawyer seeks Muslim nation resettlement (not Pakistan, Afghanistan) for peaceful life with wives.

carolrosenberg	703247346914750464	2016-02-26T15:56:47	Nevin just referred to "this forced touching program by female guards of Mr. Mohammed," and says it re-traumatizes from the Black Sites.
carolrosenberg	703247191071186944	2016-02-26T15:56:10	Nevin: "These things are directly aimed at religious beliefs and cultural beliefs... places devout Muslim in unclean state" prevents prayer.
carolrosenberg	703246780935356416	2016-02-26T15:54:32	To include "rectal hydration," which Nevin says meets definition of "rape in any state," forced nudity, "diapering that implies dominance."
carolrosenberg	703246247843536896	2016-02-26T15:52:25	He's doing CIA Black Site checklist: physical abuse, by sexual humiliation, assault, "sexually perverted behaviors"...
carolrosenberg	703246060915974144	2016-02-26T15:51:41	Nevin's talking about "Black Site torture program," designed by psychologists "really to destroy the personality in a sense of self"...
carolrosenberg	703245240241659904	2016-02-26T15:48:25	Nevin invokes political leaders' remarks, including Tom Cotton's "rot in hell," as feeding OK-to-punish atmosphere. More on that later.
carolrosenberg	703244712384327681	2016-02-26T15:46:19	Nevin's argument for inference: "Clandestine" change of SOP #39 when female touching became an issue, prison wouldn't meet defenders.
carolrosenberg	703244486978183173	2016-02-26T15:45:26	Nevin argues, however, that Pohl should infer this through "unbridled anger at Mr. Mohammad," aka KSM.
carolrosenberg	703244035734020096	2016-02-26T15:43:38	Nevin concedes that no prison witness has cast female guard touching as punishment.
carolrosenberg	703243852925308929	2016-02-26T15:42:54	Nevin's advancing 8th Amendment argument, pretrial detainees aren't supposed to be punished, no "wanton and unnecessary infliction of pain."
carolrosenberg	703243582656929792	2016-02-26T15:41:50	Nevin is talking, arguing to slides, says earlier testimony demonstrated, "The prison does not take torture into account."
carolrosenberg	703243334446419968	2016-02-26T15:40:51	Nevin is invoking obligation to treat KSM "humanely," including his mental health and psychological conditions.
carolrosenberg	703243036273283073	2016-02-26T15:39:40	Now, a year-plus into Pohl's TRO, Nevin begins arguing for permanent female-guard, no-touch order, casts it as dignity issue.
carolrosenberg	703242772581638144	2016-02-26T15:38:37	Remember: Guard force claims it's not happening, prosecutor offered 4 theories: jihad warfare, hallucination, natural sounds, not happening.
carolrosenberg	703242457866223621	2016-02-26T15:37:22	Court back in session. Judge Pohl just a Camp 7 cdr in eye, got confirmation his vibrations-noises order's posted, guards know about it.
carolrosenberg	703239804054609922	2016-02-26T15:26:49	It's whole kitandcaboodle closing argument. But do they argue unlawful command influence issue or religious accommodation first.
carolrosenberg	703239524898439169	2016-02-26T15:25:42	Okay, we're now in mid-morning recess (aka comfort break) and defense are figuring out chicken and egg female guard arguments:

carolrosenberg	703237466204065792	2016-02-26T15:17:32	KSM attorney Nevin is back asking for abate until his interpreter gets SAP readin. Pohl parries, you talk about a speedy trial.
carolrosenberg	703237398134722560	2016-02-26T15:17:15	adamgoldmanwp Probably more likely the error was mine.
carolrosenberg	703236902737088512	2016-02-26T15:15:17	adamgoldmanwp Interesting! I'll double check transcript, if they release, but thought I heard BG Martins say additional.
carolrosenberg	703236550897876992	2016-02-26T15:13:53	BG Martins says ACCM isn't program exactly, has a cap on each team's read-on, "Only 10 absent a particularized showing that they need more."
carolrosenberg	703235960067248128	2016-02-26T15:11:33	Prosecutor BG Martins' turn. "I guess I'm not going to win a popularity contest on the other side of the room today."
carolrosenberg	703235776914583552	2016-02-26T15:10:49	These ACCMs are by Pentagon, pretty mysterious. They have two-word code names. It's short for Additional Compensatory Control Measure.
carolrosenberg	703235410932178944	2016-02-26T15:09:22	Now we have several 911 defense counsel saying there is another ACCM, a 2nd one, and only Jay Connell has gotten a read in. If true, news.
carolrosenberg	703234901345230848	2016-02-26T15:07:20	Now Harrington describes team problem post FBI incursion. His new DSO has no ACCM SAP read in. (If you get this, you are a true Deep Diver.)
carolrosenberg	703234536272961537	2016-02-26T15:05:53	Judge Pohl rules: He denies David Nevin's motion to abate.
carolrosenberg	703234204755218432	2016-02-26T15:04:34	Nevin says yesterday's "instant read on" illustrates that his absent interpreter could get a clearance in like 29 minutes, if he abates.
carolrosenberg	703233939243212800	2016-02-26T15:03:31	Hawsawi attorney Ruiz argues that it's so serious Pohl should dismiss the 911 charges. KSM lawyer Nevin seeks abatement now.
carolrosenberg	703233698364264448	2016-02-26T15:02:33	Ruiz said chief prosecutor BG Martins "wields" the "national security privilege" like "a shield and a sword," casts it as incursion.
carolrosenberg	703233337817735168	2016-02-26T15:01:07	Now we have Hawsawi defense counsel Walter Ruiz likewise protesting prosecution pick-and-choose over security clearance access.
carolrosenberg	703233201544765440	2016-02-26T15:00:35	Here's MiamiHerald story about the ACCM. 
carolrosenberg	703232805631823872	2016-02-26T14:59:00	Her detailed counsel got a sudden read-in to "the ACCM" at request of chief prosecutor, something chief Defense counsel couldn't accomplish.
carolrosenberg	703232452597313541	2016-02-26T14:57:36	Now we have Cheryl Bormann on record saying something unusual happened yesterday.
carolrosenberg	703232028670558208	2016-02-26T14:55:55	Pohl says he wants not the Camp 7 lawyer, but a senior guard force member so he can " reiterate to them that they will follow it."
carolrosenberg	703231843684978688	2016-02-26T14:55:11	Prosecutor Martins says that will take time. Pohl summons "some face that I can ask, 'Is the order there? Do you understand it?'"
carolrosenberg	703231574188367872	2016-02-26T14:54:07	Pohl asks that "senior person from the guard force" of Camp 7 be brought to court to look in the eye...
carolrosenberg	703231211108487169	2016-02-26T14:52:40	Harrington wants Pohl to issue warning. Pohl asks prosecution to identify most senior guard in the court. Martins is reluctant to name her.
carolrosenberg	703231032686989312	2016-02-26T14:51:58	Harrington says Bin al Shibh considers this the "most significant problem in his life," says he'll file motion to abate.

carolrosenberg	703229963290468354	2016-02-26T14:47:43	Harrington says Bin al Shibh sent lawyers notes of Charlie Rec noises greeting him after his testimony Wednesday, is sleep deprived...
carolrosenberg	703229454869516288	2016-02-26T14:45:42	Now we have Jim Harrington, Ramzi bin al Shibh lawyer, saying today was delayed by his client's reluctance to come to court.
carolrosenberg	703229312963624960	2016-02-26T14:45:08	Pohl asks lawyers to brief "an issue" from AE400, the media motion, and says they'll take it up next time. lskslaw

carolrosenberg	702584990324957185	2016-02-24T20:04:49	Judge Pohl orders courtroom cleared, to have a 505H hearing to decide whether they need a closed classified session.
carolrosenberg	702584291860070401	2016-02-24T20:02:03	Pohl is wrapping up, to a 505H that will slide into an 802 for scheduling purposes.
carolrosenberg	702583930776637443	2016-02-24T20:00:37	Pohl says he knows what defense wants, he awaits clarification from the prosecution on what they want. (Meantime, what of KSM-Obama letter?)
carolrosenberg	702583379003383808	2016-02-24T19:58:25	Pohl tells prosecution that, if they want him to rule, he needs something specific. He invites new pleading, could include Bahlul docs.
carolrosenberg	702583117568208896	2016-02-24T19:57:23	And Judge Pohl rules, kinda, on the prosecution legal-mail motion:
carolrosenberg	702582849266917376	2016-02-24T19:56:19	Martins says the two letters a month are "appropriate" for a Law of War facility.
carolrosenberg	702582728500363264	2016-02-24T19:55:50	KSM attorney David Nevin tells judge the prison restriction on 2 letters a month via ICRC is a prison rule, not the ICRC's. Martins agrees.
carolrosenberg	702582442994081792	2016-02-24T19:54:42	If it comes back marked FOUO, he can't give it to media, for example. If it's marked UNCLASS, he can.
carolrosenberg	702582310701547521	2016-02-24T19:54:10	Connell says he sometimes marks items For Release to Media before he submits it to classification reviewers.
carolrosenberg	702581792101015556	2016-02-24T19:52:07	Connell says if they need an additional security review, add a security review team.
carolrosenberg	702581458049826816	2016-02-24T19:50:47	Pohl says, but JDG doesn't get to look at it. Connell says, but Southcom is one of the Big 5 in classification review. (Southcom runs JDG.)
carolrosenberg	702581027445858304	2016-02-24T19:49:04	Connell: We don't operate in a vacuum here.
carolrosenberg	702580979865665536	2016-02-24T19:48:53	Pohl: "The issue here is the Defense definition of legal mail " to include advocacy issues, contact with media, other courts.
carolrosenberg	702580360719278081	2016-02-24T19:46:25	Now Baluchi attorney Jay Connell is up, and Judge Pohl has questions about definitions in Pohl's legal materials handling order.
carolrosenberg	702579502392721408	2016-02-24T19:43:01	BG Martins zags to the laptop thing, says he needs to involve himself in that because it's a way to communicate between lawyer and client.
carolrosenberg	702579296821444609	2016-02-24T19:42:12	Martins: "I need to convey the kinds of harm that comes from this," says the materials "involve the kind of detainee that we have."
carolrosenberg	702579193733840897	2016-02-24T19:41:47	Martins is asking Pohl to read the Bahlul materials he just handed the Defense, and the judge.
carolrosenberg	702578878477377536	2016-02-24T19:40:32	Pohl: Isn't that the problem, how legal mail is being defined? BG Martins would like a narrow definition of legal mail.
carolrosenberg	702578700756369409	2016-02-24T19:39:50	Martins says Pohl's mail-handling order has usurped the discretion of the prison commander. Pohl: But they say this is legal mail.
carolrosenberg	702578521563144193	2016-02-24T19:39:07	Context: This is a two-year-old issue. We were told at the time there was a process to review KSM-Obama letter. 
carolrosenberg	702578133111853056	2016-02-24T19:37:34	Martins: "This is a law of war detention facility and these individuals are part of a belligerent element."
carolrosenberg	702577631783424000	2016-02-24T19:35:35	Pohl invokes KSM letter to Obama, notes there is no Camp 7 process to get that reviewed, mailed. Martins: They can write family 2x a month.
carolrosenberg	702577301259730945	2016-02-24T19:34:16	Pohl says giving it to news media waives the privilege. Martins says by waiving privilege it is no longer legal mail, needs a prison screen.
carolrosenberg	702576868394975234	2016-02-24T19:32:33	Martins says "there's a wide gaping hole" where "things need to go."
carolrosenberg	702576616640286721	2016-02-24T19:31:33	Martins: ...a camp review. It's not good enough to give it to the classification review system."  He talks about "the cloak of privilege."
carolrosenberg	702576434498371584	2016-02-24T19:30:49	Pohl asks: If lawyer wants to send info to an NGO, he needs to submit it to...
carolrosenberg	702576032856068096	2016-02-24T19:29:14	Martins wants guards to have chop. His issue: "Removal of something in the area here by means of the legal team as a privileged document."
carolrosenberg	702575850999386113	2016-02-24T19:28:30	Pohl is trying to parse this: It's okay if the lawyers get this. Is the problem when they want to pass it on, once screened.
carolrosenberg	702575159262257153	2016-02-24T19:25:45	Martins said there's always been screening of mail in camps, and judge's order distinguishes between legal and nonlegal.
carolrosenberg	702574889438470144	2016-02-24T19:24:41	Martins: "They seem to think classification review exhausts the government's interests in screening,"  says there's a security component.
carolrosenberg	702574641039151104	2016-02-24T19:23:42	Pohl tells Martins that they think it's legal mail. Martins replies that Pohl's current order is at odds with the way the camps operate.
carolrosenberg	702573844322787330	2016-02-24T19:20:32	Martins says he wants a permanent order based on an interim order they sought before governing non-legal mail.
carolrosenberg	702573588864503808	2016-02-24T19:19:31	Defense protest presentation based on that now. Pohl says no last-minute dropping of papers, has a question for Martins: What do you want?
carolrosenberg	702573330554101760	2016-02-24T19:18:29	Prosecutor BG Martins says he's just handed packets to defense lawyers of the Bahlul record of trial, for judicial notice.
carolrosenberg	702572927926083584	2016-02-24T19:16:53	Bin al Shibh attorney Jim Harrington invokes "black cloud" of former FBI investigation.

carolrosenberg	702572568549724160	2016-02-24T19:15:28	Ruiz says American people can "think for themselves, to accept or reject."
carolrosenberg	702572347522473984	2016-02-24T19:14:35	Ruiz accuses prosecution of "a desire to censor," casts it as distrust of American public's ability to read unclass info, discern.
carolrosenberg	702571668267515904	2016-02-24T19:11:53	He says prosecution left  impression that defense "somehow have been subverting rules that don't exist."
carolrosenberg	702571486607974403	2016-02-24T19:11:10	Ruiz says these agencies decide what is and isn't classified, and before release concluded BG Martins' examples were not classified.
carolrosenberg	702571036693405696	2016-02-24T19:09:22	Ruiz says classifications reviewers are national security experts at multiple agencies, to include intel analysts, CIA, SouthCom, CITF, JTF.
carolrosenberg	702570049895268353	2016-02-24T19:05:27	Ruiz is arguing the classification review is robust, skilled at looking for coded messages and threats. (Prosecution want prison to screen.)
carolrosenberg	702569412319121408	2016-02-24T19:02:55	Walter Ruiz for Hawsawi says Pohl's orders permit defense lawyers passing material from Camp 7, there is no confusion.
carolrosenberg	702569059724951553	2016-02-24T19:01:31	Nevin: There's no need for additional orders, the system is working, defense lawyers know their obligations, "everything is under control."
carolrosenberg	702568650222530560	2016-02-24T18:59:53	Nevin tells Pohl of the at-issue KSM material, "If there's something in it that is sinister or harmful, I would like to see that."
carolrosenberg	702568389903065092	2016-02-24T18:58:51	Nevin's talking about the government's opposition to Obama receiving KSM letter, notes prosecutors attached HuffPost article on website.
carolrosenberg	702568051670126593	2016-02-24T18:57:31	Nevin is telling Pohl about death penalty defender's duty to keep contact with client's family, keep client in touch with family.
carolrosenberg	702566881803288577	2016-02-24T18:52:52	Nevin says that's his understanding anyway, and that no longer happens.
carolrosenberg	702566798361808897	2016-02-24T18:52:32	Nevin says UK citizen Mr. Green's letter to KSM was mailed to Gitmo, which put a GUAN number on it, suggesting screening, gave it to KSM.
carolrosenberg	702566417133080576	2016-02-24T18:51:01	At Camp 7, it sounds like, it comes in, screened, via USPS, ICRC, legal mail. Goes out, screened, as ICRC or legal mail.
carolrosenberg	702566312535592960	2016-02-24T18:50:36	Pohl is now trying to sort out with Nevin how mail reaches, leaves Camp 7.
carolrosenberg	702565908867387393	2016-02-24T18:49:00	Nevin says he followed the rules on the examples BG Martins gave yesterday, does not believe that was required. AbundanceOfCaution
carolrosenberg	702565612208443392	2016-02-24T18:47:49	Now KSM lawyer David Nevin is back up on the legal mail v nonlegal mail issue.
carolrosenberg	702565172397940736	2016-02-24T18:46:04	And that ends the testimony of RBS. Pohl tells Harrington he'll hear disruptions testimony next time from two other detainees.
carolrosenberg	702565000649576450	2016-02-24T18:45:23	RBS: "Maybe the CIA's still at Camp 7. Nobody knows.... North Korean people, nobody knows."
carolrosenberg	702564940167696384	2016-02-24T18:45:09	RBS says he believes the guards are doing this because he interacts with the guards but says there are sometimes other people at Camp 7.
carolrosenberg	702564585228914688	2016-02-24T18:43:44	Harrington: You know why you're in custody? RBS: Yes. Harrington: This is a complaint about treatment not custody. RBS: Yes.
carolrosenberg	702564139424735232	2016-02-24T18:41:58	Harrington on RBS when he's calling female guards names, asks if he's sometimes sarcastic when he does it. RBS: Yes.
carolrosenberg	702563921874587651	2016-02-24T18:41:06	Part of it, RBS says, are based on talks with the guards. Quoted Navy guard as saying, some of these guys are doing this but not me.
carolrosenberg	702563624179605504	2016-02-24T18:39:55	RBS on the disruptions, "I believe that all the guard force knows about it. Part of this belief comes from my experience."
carolrosenberg	702563349234585600	2016-02-24T18:38:50	Now RBS is saying he can discern by activity when there are females in the control room, says he proves it by hearing intercom voice.
carolrosenberg	702562991368081409	2016-02-24T18:37:24	Clarifying earlier confusing tweet: RBS told Trivett that some of the female guards have told him that they, the guards, want to join ISIS.
carolrosenberg	702562628686749696	2016-02-24T18:35:58	Harrington asks if the Gitmo injections were voluntary. RBS says, no.
carolrosenberg	702562441507508224	2016-02-24T18:35:13	Harrington: We're there psychiatrists in the black sites? RBS: Yes.
carolrosenberg	702562320602570754	2016-02-24T18:34:44	Harrington asks if the first psychiatrist asked him about black site. RBS: Not at all.
carolrosenberg	702562198481211395	2016-02-24T18:34:15	Court back in session. Harrington doing followup on Trivett questioning about the Sept. 2006 encounter between RBS and female psychiatrist.
carolrosenberg	702540522066472961	2016-02-24T17:08:07	Harrington wants to do follow up after lunch. Sounds like Judge Pohl will do 505H today, end public part at 1500. Closed session tomorrow.
carolrosenberg	702539722682462208	2016-02-24T17:04:57	RBS, right, says he wasn't the only one to complain about the fake bird audio, Abu Zubaydah, left, did too. 
carolrosenberg	702538592351068160	2016-02-24T17:00:27	Trivett is asking about the birds complaint as we all hear a chime through the court on a 40-second delay, Wednesday audio test.
carolrosenberg	702538194236141568	2016-02-24T16:58:52	Trivett quotes part of discipline record, him threatening to cut guard's head off. RBS denies this, says "many times" records are made up.
carolrosenberg	702537867692793856	2016-02-24T16:57:34	RBS says some of that, including slut part. RBS says some guards tell him he wants to join ISIS.
carolrosenberg	702537732212596736	2016-02-24T16:57:02	Trivett asks RBS if he called a guard a slut, said he had her profile, knew how many situps and pushups, offered to tell ISIS about her.
carolrosenberg	702537221451214848	2016-02-24T16:55:00	Trivett asks about a complaint of "dancing noises" in the control room. RBS says he doesn't know about this.
carolrosenberg	702537052643004417	2016-02-24T16:54:20	Trivett asks about use of intercom at night. RBS says he uses it all the time, at night when he's woken up.
carolrosenberg	702536654238650368	2016-02-24T16:52:45	Judge Pohl says move on. Trivett: You believe all the troops are doing it to you? RBS: They are following orders, chain of command.
carolrosenberg	702536451305693184	2016-02-24T16:51:57	Harrington objects, virtually at invitation of judge. Harrington says RBS is protesting treatment to make it go away, not to wage war.
carolrosenberg	702536171394637824	2016-02-24T16:50:50	Trivett asks why he's wearing an old school Navy uniform, "You believe you are a warrior?" RBS asks to consult lawyer.
carolrosenberg	702535854108090369	2016-02-24T16:49:34	Pohl to Trivett: "Why are we here? Why are we in this trial? Because of the accusation against the accused." He gives Trivett some leeway.
carolrosenberg	702535609118793728	2016-02-24T16:48:36	4. He's lying and he's fighting the jihad against the guards in the camp. Trivett asking permission from the judge to explore this.
carolrosenberg	702535482501144576	2016-02-24T16:48:06	Trivett told judge there are four theories on the vibrations and noises. 1. It's happening. 2. He's imagining. 3. It's natural cause.
carolrosenberg	702535186517463041	2016-02-24T16:46:55	RBS says he doesn't see the control room. Trivett: So how did you call to "blonde bitch in control to stop vibrating your cell."
carolrosenberg	702534781771386881	2016-02-24T16:45:19	Prosecutor Trivett: Do you ever dream of the people killed on Sept. 11, 2001? Defense attorney Harrington: Objection. Judge Pohl: Sustained.
carolrosenberg	702534608534032385	2016-02-24T16:44:37	Prosecutor Trivett: Do you remember your dreams? Ramzi bin al Shibh: Sometimes.
carolrosenberg	702534326152515584	2016-02-24T16:43:30	RBS: "My sleep is on and off. I don't recall at all that I have slept for 4,5,6 hours since ... 2004 until now."
carolrosenberg	702534109797728258	2016-02-24T16:42:38	RBS says the vibrations depend on the guards in the control room. One watch commander, he says, did it 24 hours, called him "sick."
carolrosenberg	702533887591849986	2016-02-24T16:41:45	Trivett is asking him whether he sleeps on bed or mat on the floor. Right now he's got mat on the floor, feels the vibrations either place.
carolrosenberg	702533748429029376	2016-02-24T16:41:12	Trivett is asking him about his sleep patterns in Germany, Karachi. RBS: At night.
carolrosenberg	702533585518129153	2016-02-24T16:40:33	Trivett: Before you were captured in 2002 did you have trouble sleeping? RBS: Not at all.
carolrosenberg	702533386934599681	2016-02-24T16:39:46	Trivett says his record reflects he complained less of the vibrations and noises while on the drug. RBS said he doesn't trust the records.
carolrosenberg	702533185205309440	2016-02-24T16:38:58	Trivett asks about the pills. RBS says he subsequently took the pills because they told him if not pill, more injections.
carolrosenberg	702533024127262720	2016-02-24T16:38:20	Trivett asks if he felt the vibrations during the dead feeling. Answer unclear.
carolrosenberg	702532718626738176	2016-02-24T16:37:07	RBS says he doesn't know the term. Trivett describes him like this: "Felt dead, drooled a little bit from your right side."
carolrosenberg	702532517170188290	2016-02-24T16:36:19	Trivett said she investigated his complaints. On the injections, Trivett asks RBS if he was told he had "tardive dyskinesia."
carolrosenberg	702532146599235584	2016-02-24T16:34:50	RBS said she came after he complained of disruptions. Trivett: "This is the woman you are referring to as a war criminal right?" RBS: Yes.
carolrosenberg	702531747368607744	2016-02-24T16:33:15	Trivett on September 2006, tells us that the doctor was a "Navy psychiatrist." RBS says he met her early on, sounds like intake interview.
carolrosenberg	702531465482018816	2016-02-24T16:32:08	Judge Pohl interrupts, asks if he felt it in the attorney-client room? RBS says yes. Pohl: When the attorneys were there? RBS: Not usually.
carolrosenberg	702531269587030017	2016-02-24T16:31:21	RBS says he believes they can install it anywhere.
carolrosenberg	702531215602143232	2016-02-24T16:31:08	RBS quotes a "brother," a detainee as saying it happened in the hospital after surgery there.
carolrosenberg	702531098308427778	2016-02-24T16:30:40	Trivett: You believe the guards have the ability to vibrate you wherever you are? What about the transport van? RBS: In the car, no.
carolrosenberg	702530950350184450	2016-02-24T16:30:05	Bin al Shibh says he's felt it in Echo II, not in court but "I believe they have it everywhere."
carolrosenberg	702530744275615744	2016-02-24T16:29:16	RBS says he feels it in his seat, while sitting, feels it in his feet while standing in prayer. "It depends if they turn it on."
carolrosenberg	702530662230843394	2016-02-24T16:28:56	Trivett asks where RBS feels vibrations "in your body."
carolrosenberg	702530378460995584	2016-02-24T16:27:49	Trivett: Did ear plugs help? RBS: The noises is very sharp. He adds that the doctors ordered up special ear plugs, didn't help.
carolrosenberg	702530289323655169	2016-02-24T16:27:28	RBS says it sounds like camera noise, but notes the camera doesn't move. He says Camp 7 switched out cell camera, gestures to one in court.
carolrosenberg	702530034708439041	2016-02-24T16:26:27	Now Bin al Shibh is reenacting electronic buzzing noise, bzzzzzzzz, says ear plugs don't make it go away.
carolrosenberg	702529864155439105	2016-02-24T16:25:46	RBS: That's what I believe. Trivett: That's what you believe.
carolrosenberg	702529685935288320	2016-02-24T16:25:04	RBS says Camp 7 has concrete floors, walls. Trivett: So they can make noises and vibrations from every part of the cell?
carolrosenberg	702529478015188992	2016-02-24T16:24:14	Trivett: What do you mean by knocking and cracking? RBS: Knocking maybe I think this is the things that come sometimes from the floors.
carolrosenberg	702529278316040192	2016-02-24T16:23:26	RBS: "If it comes from the wall, it's like bing, bing, bing. Some are metal." He adds no noise, vibrations during power outages, hurricanes.
carolrosenberg	702528846759927808	2016-02-24T16:21:44	RBS: "There is many different types of sounds," lists series of sources -- wall banging, shower banging, floor banging, Charlie Rec bangs.
carolrosenberg	702528541703987200	2016-02-24T16:20:31	Trivett is using a document signed by RBS dated Dec. 18, 2013, quotes graf 2, sounds of loud banging.
carolrosenberg	702528260392009728	2016-02-24T16:19:24	Trivett asks if noise behind wall with toilet was perhaps a toilet problem? RBS: No. Trivett: Why? RBS: "I know it from the black sites."
carolrosenberg	702527896255123457	2016-02-24T16:17:57	Prosecutor Trivett: You're 100 percent sure the guards are doing this to harass you and disrupt your sleep? RBS: Yes.
carolrosenberg	702527526158114820	2016-02-24T16:16:29	Prosecutor Trivett: Is it possible that these are just normal noises and vibrations you are feeling in the building? RBS: No.
carolrosenberg	702527413297750016	2016-02-24T16:16:02	Court resuming after 15-minute comfort break.
carolrosenberg	702525392469540865	2016-02-24T16:08:00	We are now in morning comfort break and it sounds like Prosecutor Clay Trivett gets to question RBS next on conditions of confinement issue.
carolrosenberg	702525140601544704	2016-02-24T16:07:00	RBS, wrapping up defense questioning: "They tried to turn me against my brothers. That’s all." He appeared to be glancing over at KSM.
carolrosenberg	702524961068609537	2016-02-24T16:06:17	Quotes first Gitmo psychiatrist: "This is your life. You have to adjust yourself to it," and describes it as effort to gain cooperation.
carolrosenberg	702524635259215872	2016-02-24T16:04:59	Or, as RBS testifies, "Before somebody else was captured I was something special." He says, "they tried these things until now."
carolrosenberg	702524415024586752	2016-02-24T16:04:07	He describes the pitch as "Safety, good life, good future, just work with us." RBS was captured 9/11/2002, KSM six months later.
carolrosenberg	702523993119711232	2016-02-24T16:02:26	RBS: "They tried to make me work with them which I refused many times. At the black site and here at the Camp 7."
carolrosenberg	702522981592002562	2016-02-24T15:58:25	Aside: RBS' keffiyah shawl has Dome of the Rock on it. He's got prayer beads. He's accused of organizing 911 hijacker German cell.
carolrosenberg	702522632881758208	2016-02-24T15:57:02	Harrington asks him if the noises and vibrations evoke the black sites.  RBS: “Same feelings, yup... It is very hard to deal with it."
carolrosenberg	702522381525454848	2016-02-24T15:56:02	On question from Harrington he admits he damaged cameras in 2007 and 2010.
carolrosenberg	702522220141285376	2016-02-24T15:55:24	RBS says he was on meds, "they force me to do it before the first commissions started in 2008," injections stopped and he was given pills.
carolrosenberg	702521047027994624	2016-02-24T15:50:44	"It’s very funny to see my medical record," he says, adding he refused subsequent psychiatrists though at one point was FCE-ed to medical.
carolrosenberg	702520839586127874	2016-02-24T15:49:55	RBS says that psychiatrist "keep lying in the media, I saw some interviews." He refused follow-on, who "just copy and paste what she said."
carolrosenberg	702519973424582658	2016-02-24T15:46:28	RBS: "She was the first person that I have met and I don’t think she is a doctor, she is a monster. She administered all these things."
carolrosenberg	702519510377635840	2016-02-24T15:44:38	I cannot eat because of this injection... can't even pray." RBS: "I think she is a war criminal. She must be in a courtroom, in a jail now."
carolrosenberg	702519215639674880	2016-02-24T15:43:27	RBS said he got the injection every 30 days, describes that era as "worse than the black site. I couldn’t even feed myself in my cell...
carolrosenberg	702518962479898624	2016-02-24T15:42:27	RBS says psych "gave me injection that made me completely dead in my bed. I couldn't do nothing. They killed me, the worst time in my life."
carolrosenberg	702518262312144896	2016-02-24T15:39:40	RBS: "This is not a medical issue. She asked me crazy questions about crazy things in her mind -- not in my mind."
carolrosenberg	702518056845766656	2016-02-24T15:38:51	RBS says a psychiatrist was sent after his protest about bird noises. ('Ask the brothers,' he says, they heard it too.)
carolrosenberg	702517864780210179	2016-02-24T15:38:05	Harrington asks RBS if he was on drugs here. RBS: "First psychiatrist she was female she was very bad."
carolrosenberg	702517568289034241	2016-02-24T15:36:55	Harrington is asking RBS about psychiatrists he's seen. RBS said he saw three at one point, rejected others, didn't ask for any of them.
carolrosenberg	702517431798013952	2016-02-24T15:36:22	Now Harrington is having RBS tell a story: One Watch Commander told him the judge has no jurisdiction in Camp 7, his order doesn't count.
carolrosenberg	702517097751056385	2016-02-24T15:35:02	That make me believe that they are trying to interfere in this legal issues." It happened last night, he says, ahead of today's testimony.
carolrosenberg	702516573714644992	2016-02-24T15:32:57	Harrington asks about attorney meetings. RBS: "Actually I notice if I have legal meetings or commissions it goes worse."
carolrosenberg	702515805511143424	2016-02-24T15:29:54	Sometimes he cancels meetings with lawyers, interfering with his ability to prepare for trial 'especially this death penalty cases.'
carolrosenberg	702515548958154752	2016-02-24T15:28:53	RBS says the problem, "this abuse that is going on from 2004 until now" make him irritable, is focus of his attorney-client meetings...
carolrosenberg	702514865525620737	2016-02-24T15:26:10	RBS explains that the AWC is now on transfer teams, the female guard previously testified as SSG Jinx, "the one carrying our laptops."
carolrosenberg	702514614186201088	2016-02-24T15:25:10	A female Tier Supe, says RBS, explaining it's short for supervisor, could cause it to stop.
carolrosenberg	702514244735082496	2016-02-24T15:23:42	RBS says there was a female Watch Commander Assistant who left in August and on occasion "makes things better."
carolrosenberg	702514030116741120	2016-02-24T15:22:51	Harrington asks if there have been guards, tier supes who have been helpful. RBS: Yeah, very little, some of them.
carolrosenberg	702513822590959618	2016-02-24T15:22:02	Harrington asks if it's been better since Judge Pohl's cut-it-out order. RBS: "Same and worse."
carolrosenberg	702513659474534402	2016-02-24T15:21:23	RBS says at one point he was so sleepless he skipped a day of court. That night he got a good night's sleep, the disruptions had stopped.
carolrosenberg	702513508026605568	2016-02-24T15:20:47	RBS: "This is drive you crazy, make you up for 24 hours, you cannot sleep you cannot read, you cannot pray and they follow you everywhere."
carolrosenberg	702513367735525378	2016-02-24T15:20:13	Harrington asks Bin al Shibh if he ever shouts at the staff. Yes, says RBS, explaining...
carolrosenberg	702512961525567488	2016-02-24T15:18:36	Night WC replied no, he had no time. RBS quotes himself to WC: It's only one page, on the door, read it. RBS says he didn't.
carolrosenberg	702512753119010816	2016-02-24T15:17:47	At one point, RBS asked night-time Watch Commander if he read Judge Pohl's order...
carolrosenberg	702512494250749952	2016-02-24T15:16:45	RBS says he's advised camp commander there's a judicial order "to stop all these things," at one point posted it on his door.
carolrosenberg	702512226868076544	2016-02-24T15:15:41	Harrington asks if any guard, commander has come in his cell to check for it or brought experts in to examine. RBS: No.
carolrosenberg	702512084731428865	2016-02-24T15:15:07	RBS says he consistently complains, over intercom, and face to face to Watch Commander, who delivers and retrieves laptop.
carolrosenberg	702511968998002691	2016-02-24T15:14:40	On some vibrations: "If I’m lying down, sleeping, they keep moving it from stomach and legs back and forth to my feet, it goes on and off."
carolrosenberg	702510852117757953	2016-02-24T15:10:13	Judge Pohl cautions Bin al Shibh to speak only about his cell, nothing else. We learn gallery was cleared. Spectators to be brought back in.
carolrosenberg	702510647674871808	2016-02-24T15:09:25	Pohl, back on record, announces "the interruption of the feed was done by the court and not by anybody else." NoHiddenHand
carolrosenberg	702510461544243205	2016-02-24T15:08:40	Seems the description of the main gate caused it.
carolrosenberg	702510354597863424	2016-02-24T15:08:15	Somebody has hit court's white noise button, cut the 40-second delay feed. We see a picture of the judge's empty bench, PLEASE STANDBY.
carolrosenberg	702510177321353216	2016-02-24T15:07:32	RBS is describing the entrance to Camp 7, doing an architecture explanation and...
carolrosenberg	702510088842567680	2016-02-24T15:07:11	RBS says he's under constant surveillance and it starts when he's trying to work and sleep.
carolrosenberg	702509930180382720	2016-02-24T15:06:34	RBS describes it as systematic, like "SOP." He casts subsequent Navy and Army troops as doing it "very crazy," sounds like random.
carolrosenberg	702509509034582017	2016-02-24T15:04:53	Bin al Shibh says Army guards circa 2006-2009 had "some kind of a plan" and "they were doing it in a professional way."
carolrosenberg	702509037062131712	2016-02-24T15:03:01	There were also bird noises, RBS says, from 2006 for some years. Harrington submits 152RR, shows camp broadcast "artificial bird noises."
carolrosenberg	702508524824358912	2016-02-24T15:00:58	RBS says his cell's been changed 6 times, and there were noises and vibrations until now.
carolrosenberg	702508328006643713	2016-02-24T15:00:12	Harrington is referencing a filing that logs RBS complaints in 2014. RBS says it's true. Deep divers: Here you go, 
carolrosenberg	702507771346952192	2016-02-24T14:57:59	RBS said it began as "fence banging of my Charlie Rec" while he was preparing for today's testimony, working on laptop. Then the vibrations.
carolrosenberg	702507487610667008	2016-02-24T14:56:51	Harrington's leading him, clearly with permission. RBS: "Last night was like every other night for me. I couldn't sleep."
carolrosenberg	702506632564097028	2016-02-24T14:53:27	RBS says noises started in his first weeks at Camp 7: 'Banging on the wall of my cell and outside my Charlie Rec... backyard of my cell.'
carolrosenberg	702506267596693505	2016-02-24T14:52:00	RBS: "They make all my life... upside down. I can't concentrate... I can't sleep. I can't pray. I can't do anything."
carolrosenberg	702505996959272960	2016-02-24T14:50:56	"Since then," says RBS, "until now."
carolrosenberg	702505888817553408	2016-02-24T14:50:30	RBS says "no vibrations mentioned in this report." Harrington: But they were used? RBS: Yes.
carolrosenberg	702505711356551169	2016-02-24T14:49:48	We see RBS in old school Navy desert camo jacket, a black checked keffiya hanging from his shoulders, similar design turban.
carolrosenberg	702505481592578049	2016-02-24T14:48:53	Harrington admits 152QQ as evidence, pages from the Senate Report that mention Ramzi bin al Shibh.
carolrosenberg	702505221075791872	2016-02-24T14:47:51	RBS says he's read the part of the public portion of the publicly released so-called Senate Torture Report that mentions him.
carolrosenberg	702505083481808896	2016-02-24T14:47:18	torture through he use of noises, torture through use of vibrations. (Four separate questions. Four separate times yes.)
carolrosenberg	702504993392353284	2016-02-24T14:46:56	RBS says "yes" to sequential questions of whether he was subjected to physical abuse, psychological abuse...
carolrosenberg	702504743235620865	2016-02-24T14:45:57	Bin al Shibh says he's been in Camp 7 since Sept. 6, 2006, before that held in U.S. custody in other place.
carolrosenberg	702504600679686145	2016-02-24T14:45:23	Harrington: How long in U.S. custody? RBS: "Now about 15 years," in English.
carolrosenberg	702504492361719808	2016-02-24T14:44:57	RBS: "I'm 43 years old."
carolrosenberg	702504382173224961	2016-02-24T14:44:31	Bin al Shibh is doing a little prayer in response to question on his age.
carolrosenberg	702504291769126916	2016-02-24T14:44:09	Now we have BG Martins, chief prosecutor, asking for "whole truth, nothing but the truth." RBS agrees.
carolrosenberg	702504119827898369	2016-02-24T14:43:28	Pohl: "I'm not sure the accused has been given classification guidance." He tells attorney Harrington to stick to "current camp conditions."
carolrosenberg	702503950793228288	2016-02-24T14:42:48	Prosecutor Clay Trivett wants Judge Pohl to warn alleged 911 plotter Ramzi Bin al Shibh (RBS) to not spill classified information.
carolrosenberg	702503653081534464	2016-02-24T14:41:37	Judge Pohl is now shifting to Bin al Shibh testimony. Says there will be no shackles, all witnesses are to be treated equally.
carolrosenberg	702503482947989504	2016-02-24T14:40:56	Pohl says there are now three 505H issues and it might be OK to do today, clear court and move to closed session to consider closed session.
carolrosenberg	702503232598319104	2016-02-24T14:39:57	Pohl is saying he'll 505H this, then may go straight to 806 on it without gap, invoking "exigencies of the trial." Connell seeks 505H today.
carolrosenberg	702502883078610946	2016-02-24T14:38:33	Pohl is instructing his staff to handle "at least temporarily" as Secret NOFORN these three documents at issue that were not classified.
carolrosenberg	702502585165615104	2016-02-24T14:37:22	Judge Pohl postpones open session discussion, permits government to temporarily seal three documents, pending closed session.
carolrosenberg	702502357490343936	2016-02-24T14:36:28	Nevin "public has interest in this exact kind of development," illustrates how process is "hamstrung."
carolrosenberg	702502212627513344	2016-02-24T14:35:54	Connell has noted that media attorney Dave Schulz of lskslaw has left the island.
carolrosenberg	702502128846282754	2016-02-24T14:35:34	KSM attorney David Nevin wants to talk about this in open session without revealing classified info.
carolrosenberg	702501964903534592	2016-02-24T14:34:54	Hard to follow. There's a discussion of dipping into various databases. Pohl offers possibility that "Big G in the sky" permitted a spillage
carolrosenberg	702501694320582656	2016-02-24T14:33:50	Thinking this was yesterday morning's RDI discovery related arguments, while I was derailed on Plan coverage.
carolrosenberg	702501511058825216	2016-02-24T14:33:06	Connell's now prospectively protesting possibility of redaction of transcript that has not been posted on Pentagon website.
carolrosenberg	702501122032975872	2016-02-24T14:31:33	Up for Defense, Jay Connell says he's good with sealing Lima, not Kilo and Mike. Groharing interrupts, seeks closed session.
carolrosenberg	702500839605334017	2016-02-24T14:30:26	Groaharing wants more than one document sealed for classification review and also an email he sent Defense sealed as FOUO.
carolrosenberg	702500590392320002	2016-02-24T14:29:27	Judge Pohl wants to know if the classification review is about what was withheld under FOIA or subsequently unredacted.
carolrosenberg	702500352889917440	2016-02-24T14:28:30	It sounds like at issue is the gap between a FOIA released document and a more transparent document furnished to Defense.
carolrosenberg	702499977696829440	2016-02-24T14:27:01	Sept. 11 pretrial hearing now in session with Judge Pohl questioning proecutor Jeffrey Groharing about a potential document sealing.

carolrosenberg	702492157614100480	2016-02-24T13:55:56	Lots of folks down here still wondering how Obama might speed up war court process. Shorten the 40-second delay to 20?

carolrosenberg	702465878647029760	2016-02-24T12:11:31	Hello from Gitmo. Expect conditions of confinement testimony today from accused 911 plot deputy Ramzi bin al Shibh. 
carolrosenberg	702316882540552193	2016-02-24T02:19:27	"Guantanamo North" in 2036?? Build anew? Tweak war court? My 10 intriguing parts of Obama Closure Plan Roll-out: 
carolrosenberg	702315193406234624	2016-02-24T02:12:45	Only at Gitmo war court? Media attorney LSKSDave wrapped up yesterday, got to gallery and saw tail-end of his argument on 40-second delay.
carolrosenberg	702291582758821888	2016-02-24T00:38:55	Spoke Closure Plan with PRI/TheWorld's MarcoWerman from scratchy Gitmo phone line this very busy day.  ThankYou
carolrosenberg	702251476547190786	2016-02-23T21:59:33	With that, the war court is in recess until 9a tomorrow with out-of-order Bin al Shibh testimony, then back to legal-nonlegal mail issue.
carolrosenberg	702251248448315392	2016-02-23T21:58:39	Pohl did suggest guards may position themselves differently but that the default is no restraints. Topic: Camp 7 noises and vibrations.
carolrosenberg	702250744506933249	2016-02-23T21:56:39	Bin al Shibh attorney Jim Harrington asks if he can testify from the defense table. Pohl vetoes that, says it complicates cross examination.
carolrosenberg	702250597068709888	2016-02-23T21:56:04	Ramzi bin al Shibh is due to testify tomorrow. Pohl says what the guards do outside court is their business, in his court, no restraints.
carolrosenberg	702250363265613825	2016-02-23T21:55:08	Judge Pohl's wrapping up with open-court admonition: The default in his court is witnesses testify in his witness box with no restraints.
carolrosenberg	702249264974581761	2016-02-23T21:50:46	Pohl asks, so it's Connell's position that an attorney can pass along a letter to the media. Connell: Yes.
carolrosenberg	702248951991369728	2016-02-23T21:49:31	Pohl asks what about a non-threatening letter to terror group recipient. Connell says it's illegal to communicate with terror group.
carolrosenberg	702248528131837952	2016-02-23T21:47:50	Pohl's probing. Asks what if a lawyer got a threat? Connell says a lawyer can't convey a threat for his client.
carolrosenberg	702247906766671873	2016-02-23T21:45:22	Pohl is clarifying, again, that Baluchi can't mail anything from Gitmo, asks if that's true of all 91 at Gitmo? Connell only knows Camp 7
carolrosenberg	702247281567916037	2016-02-23T21:42:53	Judge Pohl: Your position is virtually anything from a client would constitute legal mail? Connell: Yes.
carolrosenberg	702246514786226177	2016-02-23T21:39:50	Connell says lawyer's duty is to establish relationships as part of mitigation. Communication with family, for example, is part of that.
carolrosenberg	702246111235411969	2016-02-23T21:38:14	Connell says he must get it classification reviewed but, once cleared, he can use it as "professional legal services for the client."
carolrosenberg	702245567364263938	2016-02-23T21:36:05	Connell gives a theoretical example: Baluchi writes him with an answer to the media.
carolrosenberg	702244322012479488	2016-02-23T21:31:08	Now we get a Connell tutorial on how comms come and go between lawyers and Baluchi.
carolrosenberg	702243720461164544	2016-02-23T21:28:44	Connell contends the confusion is within the government, there's nothing that restricts classification reviewed mail through the attorneys.
carolrosenberg	702243385499906050	2016-02-23T21:27:24	Connell says, at Camp 7, Baluchi can send mail two ways: 1. To his lawyers via classification review 2. ICRC messages.
carolrosenberg	702243025477640192	2016-02-23T21:25:58	Connell argues: The protective orders for classification review allow outgoing communications.
carolrosenberg	702242578721325056	2016-02-23T21:24:12	Nevin does not concede it's not legal mail, says there's dispute over what constitutes legal mail. Now we get a Jay Connell slideshow. 18PPP
carolrosenberg	702241872270532613	2016-02-23T21:21:24	Pohl: If it's nonlegal mail put through classification review that permits you to release it without submission to detention facility?
carolrosenberg	702241494871187457	2016-02-23T21:19:54	Nevin says the UK letter was properly marked with a GUAN number, put through classification review, which cleared them for public release.
carolrosenberg	702241094541639680	2016-02-23T21:18:18	Nevin suggests experiment in the letter was to determine how long it takes mail to reach her.
carolrosenberg	702240919521771520	2016-02-23T21:17:36	Letter to KSM's wife: Nevin says it was legal mail, lawyers gave it to the Camp 7 staff attorney for J-2 screening review, it was cleared.
carolrosenberg	702240377852588034	2016-02-23T21:15:27	KSM lawyer David Nevins responds: The prosecution's factual premise is incorrect, is cloaked in "willy-nilly" and "serious allegations."
carolrosenberg	702239969528705026	2016-02-23T21:13:50	Judge Pohl: I'm hearing non-legal-mail is being processed not through guard force, doing classification review and mailing to 3rd parties.
carolrosenberg	702239457160859648	2016-02-23T21:11:48	This sounds like a bid to narrowly define legal mail, let prison review teams review the rest. (Defense team mail is reviewed separately.)
carolrosenberg	702238449156407296	2016-02-23T21:07:47	BG Martins says KSM's letter to Obama was non-legal mail, the prison should decide if it can be mailed, invokes Gitmo guard security.
carolrosenberg	702237959555305473	2016-02-23T21:05:51	Martins' last example: KSM attorneys want to mail his letter to Obama, filed motion, attached a copy. Background: 
carolrosenberg	702237369655758848	2016-02-23T21:03:30	Another Martins ex: HuffPost published "Statement to the Crusaders of the Military Comissions at Guantanamo," prosecutors got copies too.
carolrosenberg	702237102898094081	2016-02-23T21:02:26	Another example: UK dude named Green got a letter from KSM that had been submitted through declassification review.
carolrosenberg	702236821636435969	2016-02-23T21:01:19	"The letters you sent through attorneys as an experiment have reached us."
carolrosenberg	702236683266347009	2016-02-23T21:00:46	BG Martins is reciting examples, concerns, quoting a 10/11/13 ICRC message to KSM from his wife...
carolrosenberg	702236225961332736	2016-02-23T20:58:57	This is about  legal v non-legal mail, protecting the attorney-client privilege consistent with Gitmo 's Camp 7 security concerns.
carolrosenberg	702235746623746050	2016-02-23T20:57:03	Chief Prosecutor Brig. Gen. Martins is arguing. "The United States is in a state of hostilities with al-Qaida and associated forces..."
carolrosenberg	702235677111558144	2016-02-23T20:56:46	The 911 hearing is back in session with continuing Protective Order motions.
carolrosenberg	702229750048276480	2016-02-23T20:33:13	We're in mid-afternoon comfort break in 911 hearings on pretrial discovery. Every time I dip into that Gitmo Plan, I find another nugget.
carolrosenberg	702227305880485888	2016-02-23T20:23:31	Whoa! Way I read this, someone imagines "Gitmo North" lasting 20 years. 
carolrosenberg	702218628775555072	2016-02-23T19:49:02	Ryan suggests defense should try to talk to general counsels of all of the agencies, prosecution will then consult and protect equities.
carolrosenberg	702218309186560001	2016-02-23T19:47:46	Prosecutor Ryan on Touhy: Probably every federal agency was involved in 911, for example the FAA...
carolrosenberg	702217002333642752	2016-02-23T19:42:34	AUSA Ryan: CIA typically has no part in typical law enforcement activities. FBI agents got a pass in past prosecution as within case scope.
carolrosenberg	702216482072219648	2016-02-23T19:40:30	Prosecutor Ryan: To call any agent.
carolrosenberg	702216289260085248	2016-02-23T19:39:44	Judge Pohl: If defense wants to call a CIA agent for case in chief will they have to file a Touhy notice?
carolrosenberg	702215189400305668	2016-02-23T19:35:22	This is the Touhy argument. (And if you know what that means you definitely qualify as a deep diver.)
carolrosenberg	702213528829222912	2016-02-23T19:28:46	At war court, Prosecutor Ed Ryan's talking about ex CIA interpreter who wound up on defense staff, and now withdrawn prosecution motion.
carolrosenberg	702212750882291713	2016-02-23T19:25:40	Spokesman: Admiral in charge of 91-captive, 2,000-staff detention center watched Obama, "is lock step with POTUS." 
carolrosenberg	702212118825848832	2016-02-23T19:23:10	Gitmo prison spokesman unaware of any cell block reaction to Obama's remarks, release of closure plan. Some detainees see TVs.
carolrosenberg	702207656283529216	2016-02-23T19:05:26	Jay Connell is now talking about CIA's "operational control" of the 911 accused versus military's "nominal control' here at Gitmo.
carolrosenberg	702202692580597760	2016-02-23T18:45:42	Now war court's 40-second delay feed shows a white screen as we hear Bormann's voice, describing redactions. Elmo challenge, I think.
carolrosenberg	702202014823030784	2016-02-23T18:43:01	She argues that it's not only Pohl who looks over shoulder of the prosecution judgment of discover-able, it goes to the appellate record.
carolrosenberg	702201668176375808	2016-02-23T18:41:38	Bormann says Pohl must get unredacted copy to check prosecution: "There has to be judicial review of the discovery process."
carolrosenberg	702201028733759488	2016-02-23T18:39:06	Bormann: 'Today the government tells you you don't get to know what's behind the redaction.... That can't be the way the law works.'
carolrosenberg	702200421033631744	2016-02-23T18:36:41	For Bin Attash, Cheryl Bormann lectures Judge Pohl that it's judge's role to hold the prosecution accountable for each classified redaction.
carolrosenberg	702199979079766016	2016-02-23T18:34:55	Here at Camp Justice, 911 pretrial hearings resume with KSM, Baluchi, Bin al Shibh in court. Arguments resume on CIA Black Site discovery.

carolrosenberg	702162095643688960	2016-02-23T16:04:23	In plan: Vision of federal guilty pleas to move today's detainees to federal prison, downsize Gitmo North even more.

carolrosenberg	702156379520376832	2016-02-23T15:41:40	We are watching President Obama discuss closing Guantanamo prison at Camp Justice during mid-morning recess in 911 pretrial hearings.

carolrosenberg	701861684223287297	2016-02-22T20:10:40	Nevin: "I'm trying to get at the fact of why the change was made... I'm just asking for discovery, that's all" -- not SOP change witnesses.
carolrosenberg	701861201706356737	2016-02-22T20:08:45	Pohl reminds Nevin that it's Colonel Heath's SOP. He signed it, he owns it. Nevin reminds Pohl: He doesn't remember signing it.
carolrosenberg	701860738692988929	2016-02-22T20:06:54	Nevin's back. Unless Pohl won't rule there is no valid penological interest, he says he needs to explore that claim through discovery.
carolrosenberg	701860348400377857	2016-02-22T20:05:21	Swann says Pohl doesn't need to hear from "a bunch of lawyers," in his experience commanders often ignore their lawyers.
carolrosenberg	701860104006668288	2016-02-22T20:04:23	Swann is now arguing, citing his long history as an Army colonel, "I know what an SOP is."
carolrosenberg	701859918408720385	2016-02-22T20:03:39	Nevin says he suspects "this evidence would torpedo this case, that's why I want to get my hands on it."
carolrosenberg	701859811244302336	2016-02-22T20:03:13	Nevin wonders aloud if Southcom did it, or somebody to punish detainees. He wants to check prosecution claim it's valid penalogical purpose.
carolrosenberg	701859523091419137	2016-02-22T20:02:04	Oops. I'm wrong. Nevin doesn't necessarily want them as witnesses, he wants them through discovery to explore where it came from.
carolrosenberg	701859064721096704	2016-02-22T20:00:15	Nevin argues the SJA made this change but wants witnesses of who else was involved in erasing cultural consideration.
carolrosenberg	701858429015564288	2016-02-22T19:57:44	The chief of the guards is signing an affidavit on need for female guards touching Camp 7 detainees.

carolrosenberg	701857429122891777	2016-02-22T19:53:45	Speaking of vanishing words... Nevin is showing before and after SOP as the female guard issue was erupting that erased a sentence:
carolrosenberg	701856263836196864	2016-02-22T19:49:07	Actually, GitmoWatch, more than a dozen news groups, 2 here this week. Full list at bottom of this article: 
carolrosenberg	701855590759399425	2016-02-22T19:46:27	Nevin replies it's painful for his client, wants medical expert to explain. "The harm flows from the torture, and the harm is inescapable."
carolrosenberg	701854719833198592	2016-02-22T19:42:59	...with a description of what went on in that case that sounds a lot like U.S. male guards groping U.S. female prisoners.
carolrosenberg	701854533274701824	2016-02-22T19:42:15	Swann calls it "simple touchings that are required" and dismisses a defense case precedent invoked by Nevin...
carolrosenberg	701853861066231809	2016-02-22T19:39:34	Swann is describing the points on body female guards might touch -- arms, legs, forehead.
carolrosenberg	701853635077136384	2016-02-22T19:38:41	Case prosecutor Bob Swann is now arguing -- opposing Nevin motion for reconsideration of witnesses, says enough has been said on the topic.
carolrosenberg	701847811717992454	2016-02-22T19:15:32	Nevin: Dr. Pablo Stewart on sexual touching impact of defendants' ability to participate at trial, retraumatization.
carolrosenberg	701847558130421761	2016-02-22T19:14:32	Pohl: You want me to consider 8th Amendment? Who do you want as an expert?
carolrosenberg	701847000749309952	2016-02-22T19:12:19	He invokes "clandestine amendment" of an SOP and Col. Heath's testimony that part of his declaration was exaggerated.
carolrosenberg	701846798818738177	2016-02-22T19:11:31	Nevin says KSM "politely objected to female touching," his lawyers wrote prison, sought were refused a meeting...
carolrosenberg	701846288934027264	2016-02-22T19:09:29	Nevin adds that witnesses said they don't consider captives' torture in deciding how to deal with them, calls it "deliberate indifference."
carolrosenberg	701846041428099072	2016-02-22T19:08:30	Nevin makes the religious, torture argument again and caps it with, it's not necessary.
carolrosenberg	701845979289485312	2016-02-22T19:08:15	Pohl: Basically you want me to restrict a female MP from doing duties simply because she's female?
carolrosenberg	701845807629279233	2016-02-22T19:07:34	Nevin says best-case scenario it's military-wide gender equality issue not exigency, adds military does do accommodate females separately.
carolrosenberg	701845169927286784	2016-02-22T19:05:02	Nevin and Pohl are discussing whether this is a hardship for Camp 7 to not use the females or they're getting by just fine. TakeThatHill
carolrosenberg	701844193581334532	2016-02-22T19:01:10	Nevin: 'If there's the wanton, unnecessary infliction of pain you can't do that.' Judge Pohl: 'I understand that.'
carolrosenberg	701843039002693633	2016-02-22T18:56:34	"We want to be able to prove this by expert testimony," says Nevin. "We have infliction of pain here."
carolrosenberg	701842909423869952	2016-02-22T18:56:03	Nevin: "Forced touching by women at Camp 7 starts this all over again," describing it as reliving experience here.
carolrosenberg	701842392870207488	2016-02-22T18:54:00	Nevin invokes CIA black site "sexualized torture that has specifically involved extensive unwanted touching by women, forced nakedness."
carolrosenberg	701842127970553856	2016-02-22T18:52:57	Nevin notes that government witnesses deny this is punitive, invokes the unnecessary wanton and infliction of pain prohibition.
carolrosenberg	701841830984470528	2016-02-22T18:51:46	"We know that the case, because of its subject matter, obviously raises extremely high emotions," both in the court and the Beltway.
carolrosenberg	701841652294541315	2016-02-22T18:51:04	Nevin says he sees an inference of punishment in female guard touching after years of a workaround. Calls it intentional, planned policy.
carolrosenberg	701841354670874624	2016-02-22T18:49:53	Nevin says they haven't been allowed to call witnesses to demonstrate the impact of his client being touched by female guards.
carolrosenberg	701840929133613056	2016-02-22T18:48:11	Now KSM attorney David Nevin's arguing a motion to reconsider a denial of witnesses in the female guard restraining order motion.
carolrosenberg	701838414686109696	2016-02-22T18:38:12	Thursday's closed session is an 806, to take secret testimony involving classified evidence. Pohl says he might hear classified arguments.
carolrosenberg	701838017539997696	2016-02-22T18:36:37	Way forward: Judge Pohl says they'll do closed sessions on Thursday and intend to reopen Friday. Martins wants to argue female guards.
carolrosenberg	701837728892248064	2016-02-22T18:35:28	Prosecution requests Connell discussion about redacted bits of Oct. 30 transcript in 505H session, which Schulz can't attend anyway.
carolrosenberg	701837401610698755	2016-02-22T18:34:10	Here at Camp Justice, Sept. 11 hearing's resumed with KSM back in court and LSKSDave ferrying to Leeward Side for flight back to mainland.

carolrosenberg	701833571187748869	2016-02-22T18:18:57	First Amendment attorney Dave Schulz, LSKSDave, after arguing to unseal transcript of public Gitmo 911 hearing. 
carolrosenberg	701824858813030400	2016-02-22T17:44:20	Here's our Guantanamo Sept. 11 trial guide with a Who's Who of those in court, for those interested:  MiamiHerald
carolrosenberg	701818264855441408	2016-02-22T17:18:08	This media motion took longer to argue, counter argue than I imagined. And in the midst, KSM attorney Nevin teases a coming recusal motion.
carolrosenberg	701812887925477380	2016-02-22T16:56:46	So we are in lunch recess until 1330.
carolrosenberg	701812773106409475	2016-02-22T16:56:18	Connell wanted to reference his compare and contrast transcript of what we don't see with what judge does. Martins asked time to review it.
carolrosenberg	701811296069615617	2016-02-22T16:50:26	Connell: Judge decides if it can be released or not.
carolrosenberg	701811151068336128	2016-02-22T16:49:52	Judge Pohl is now asking about a potential "spillage," and the duty not to further disseminate.
carolrosenberg	701810597407678465	2016-02-22T16:47:40	Judge frames the issue as power "to adjust the transcript without authorization of the judge."
carolrosenberg	701810285204660224	2016-02-22T16:46:25	Sounds like Connell's saying the prosecution, DRT can't block release of public transcript made outside the courtroom. It's on the judge.
carolrosenberg	701809388957396993	2016-02-22T16:42:51	Connell now up, says Martins got it wrong, the war court's draft transcript rule doesn't make constitution no-judicial-record determination.
carolrosenberg	701808787691278336	2016-02-22T16:40:28	Schulz: It became public info the moment it was uttered in open court. "The government is trying to put the genie back in the bottle."
carolrosenberg	701808527933882368	2016-02-22T16:39:26	Schulz: Media is asking the judge to 'prevent censorship by the government that the public has a constitutional right to know.'
carolrosenberg	701808378121687041	2016-02-22T16:38:50	Judge Pohl interjects, again, that it sounds like media is asking judge to release classified information...
carolrosenberg	701808003050246144	2016-02-22T16:37:21	Schulz argues that Pohl has a duty to weigh Rear Adm. Clarke's sealed declaration, which media attorney can't see since it's Secret.
carolrosenberg	701807682316013569	2016-02-22T16:36:05	Schulz is making chicken and egg argument: The government has right to overcome the burden, not the media.
carolrosenberg	701807445744680960	2016-02-22T16:35:08	Schulz is arguing that Martins got Press Enterprise II wrong. (Deep divers: See transcript, unless they redact it before posting.)
carolrosenberg	701807145818443776	2016-02-22T16:33:57	Media attorney LSKSDave is back: It's a constitutional question. The transcripts we are talking about are clearly judicial records.
carolrosenberg	701806917879013379	2016-02-22T16:33:02	A partial redacted transcript, says the prosecutor, gives people something to "look at, shoot at, argue it's too heavy handed."
carolrosenberg	701806819866501121	2016-02-22T16:32:39	Martins tells Pohl that  "getting something out there is part of the transparency... It's not lacking value to get something out there."
carolrosenberg	701806507315355648	2016-02-22T16:31:24	Martins reminds that the process allows "media complaining about these things."
carolrosenberg	701806399920152576	2016-02-22T16:30:59	Judge Pohl: In future would you need judicial review of redactions? Martins: That's not the regulation for trial process. You're not an OCA.
carolrosenberg	701806184286842882	2016-02-22T16:30:07	Judge Pohl: But what's the way forward. BG Martins: Validate it. (Sounds like because of the motion, not the authority.)
carolrosenberg	701805917663322113	2016-02-22T16:29:04	Bormann for Bin Attash objects, far afield. Judge Pohl overrules, lets Martin wrap up his description of the 10/30 testimony.
carolrosenberg	701805770548105216	2016-02-22T16:28:29	Martins is now arguing 10/30 testimony demonstrated guards' humane detention despite unpopular order restricting female guards.
carolrosenberg	701805341911207936	2016-02-22T16:26:47	Martins calls it collateral matter, says 40-sec delay spectators did hear entire testimony, "to scrutinize both witnesses under oath."
carolrosenberg	701804856403738624	2016-02-22T16:24:51	Martins: We do. But he says under "exceptional" circumstances the government has fallback to "measure of after the utterance redaction."
carolrosenberg	701804605143908353	2016-02-22T16:23:51	Judge Pohl:  Shouldn't the prosecution have objected real time?
carolrosenberg	701804324771524608	2016-02-22T16:22:44	...then after "careful rellook" left just 6.2 percent redacted of 45,000 word transcript. ThankYouGeneralMartins
carolrosenberg	701804158542807040	2016-02-22T16:22:04	In first effort of redaction, censor blacked out 18 percent of 10/30 transcript...
carolrosenberg	701803884382175232	2016-02-22T16:20:59	Martins is talking about the "still redacted information," referencing do-over that un-blacked-out some material and offers metrics:
carolrosenberg	701803358043172866	2016-02-22T16:18:54	Martins: Maybe if media describes an identifiable damage. Meantime, he says, Rear Adm. Clarke argues the dangers of a mine-able transcript.
carolrosenberg	701803085228855296	2016-02-22T16:17:49	Pohl asks if he as judge has the authority to order the release of classified information under a First Amendment analysis.
carolrosenberg	701802777262030848	2016-02-22T16:16:35	Martins: Clarke is invoking his authority in his classified AE400C declaration, cities unclassified "for the whole world to see" remark.
carolrosenberg	701802270279729152	2016-02-22T16:14:34	Judge Pohl: Were all the redactions classified? Martins: Rear Adm. Clarke, detention center commander, is Original Classification Authority.
carolrosenberg	701801967895625728	2016-02-22T16:13:22	Martins invokes Rear Adm. Clarke declaration, notes "that is not the kind of information that has typically had a right to public access."
carolrosenberg	701801762613764097	2016-02-22T16:12:33	Martins to Pohl: By your own rules of court it's not authenticated. The media side didn't prove it's a judicial record.
carolrosenberg	701801520497614853	2016-02-22T16:11:35	Judge Pohl asks about the draft transcript: "Is it a government record?" BG Martins: It's not a judicial record, which is the standard.
carolrosenberg	701801256340365312	2016-02-22T16:10:33	Judge Pohl interrupts and invokes a rule about public right to access. Martins: That's why Schulz was allowed to come in and argue.
carolrosenberg	701801042934165505	2016-02-22T16:09:42	Martins is mirroring his response to motion that the transcript's are judicial record. About his response: 
carolrosenberg	701800843427893249	2016-02-22T16:08:54	Martins described the information under redaction as "protected," said Schulz offered "no compelling response" to unofficial draft argument.
carolrosenberg	701800682584719360	2016-02-22T16:08:16	Martins says of Oct. 30 transcript that OCA considered totality, concluded disseminating info "would cause damage to national security."
carolrosenberg	701800400299679744	2016-02-22T16:07:08	Martins on Pohl's duty: "To ensure the rights of all parties are protected while affording public access and protecting national security."
carolrosenberg	701800242308628480	2016-02-22T16:06:31	Prosecutor BG Martins is now arguing that judge should reject the unseal motion.
carolrosenberg	701799957393756160	2016-02-22T16:05:23	Now we have Jim Harrington for Ramzi Bin al Shibh doing the 'horse out of the barn door analogy,' notes info went to DC area by CCTV too.
carolrosenberg	701799714082181124	2016-02-22T16:04:25	Nevin adds that this apparent secret order also should lead to recusal of prosecution, and he plans to seek that too.
carolrosenberg	701799578673225728	2016-02-22T16:03:53	Nevin also drops a hint of something he considers sinister: Says judge issued a secret order 10 days ago, and he'll seek Pohl's recusal.
carolrosenberg	701799316315381761	2016-02-22T16:02:50	Nevin notes that Oct. 30 "the government watched this for a day," did not object, speaks to war court legitimacy and fundamental fairness.
carolrosenberg	701799139777114113	2016-02-22T16:02:08	Nevin: "One of the problems with the Star Chamber is that it was done in secret," notes American Revolution was "to put a stop to that."
carolrosenberg	701798878350327808	2016-02-22T16:01:06	Nevin said this underscores issue of "fundamental fairness" in a capital case that already has a measure of secrecy.
carolrosenberg	701798611101863937	2016-02-22T16:00:02	Nevin quotes Pohl back to him that he, the judge, decides what leaves his courtroom.
carolrosenberg	701798316779171841	2016-02-22T15:58:52	Nevin invokes the hidden-hand episode, someone outside muting courtroom feed to public.
carolrosenberg	701798124646486016	2016-02-22T15:58:06	KSM attorney David Nevin now arguing, tells Pohl his opinion is, once something is testified in court, "It's your information."
carolrosenberg	701797898263072769	2016-02-22T15:57:12	Judge Pohl's back, clarifying with Connell whether he wants a 505H hearing on the media motion. Connell: Depends on prosecution argument.

carolrosenberg	701792967317659648	2016-02-22T15:37:36	With that, we are in mid morning recess.
carolrosenberg	701792795330289666	2016-02-22T15:36:55	It's complete Oct. 30 transcript marked TOP SECRET. Connell's "red boxed" redactions to show judge what he sees as inconsistency. AE400F
carolrosenberg	701792337362599936	2016-02-22T15:35:06	Connell submits a sealed document that media attorney hasn't been given as, sounds like, classified...
carolrosenberg	701792107086880768	2016-02-22T15:34:11	Connell adds: Redactions in transcript are not supported by declaration of Rear Adm. Peter J. Clarke, the new detention center commander.
carolrosenberg	701791642806779904	2016-02-22T15:32:20	Connell says the judge has a role here: To check the "unilateral-ness of the government's control" of transcript production, release.
carolrosenberg	701791344222728193	2016-02-22T15:31:09	Connell says the Oct. 30 transcript captured "not a leak" but "an authorized public disclosure of information."
carolrosenberg	701790578904797185	2016-02-22T15:28:07	Connell argues government has authority to shield from the public but has to invoke Classified Info Privilege, didn't in Oct. 30 redactions.
carolrosenberg	701789927093223425	2016-02-22T15:25:31	Connell argues judge should be involved only when a "constitutional event happens," meaning someone affirmatively asks him to step-in, seal.
carolrosenberg	701789592203227136	2016-02-22T15:24:12	Connell says military judge should not get involved in daily, ordinary production of transcripts.
carolrosenberg	701788619250470912	2016-02-22T15:20:20	Connell says court reporters create public transcript outside the courtroom, hear what the public hear, argues no ex-post redaction power.
carolrosenberg	701788222179958784	2016-02-22T15:18:45	But Connell says it's not "governmental largess," cites regulation that Convening Authority release DRAFT UNOFFICIAL daily transcript.
carolrosenberg	701787884525903872	2016-02-22T15:17:24	Connell also argues that the prosecution uses transcripts "to justify its regime."
carolrosenberg	701787353602506755	2016-02-22T15:15:18	Connell explains official transcript comes at case end, casts unauthenticated transcript as portal to public for 911trial proceedings.
carolrosenberg	701786767997980674	2016-02-22T15:12:58	Connell: "We're located on a secure facility on a remote island." He invokes logistical challenges, controlled access to the courtroom.
carolrosenberg	701786422081155073	2016-02-22T15:11:36	Now Connell for Baluchi is making 6th Amendment argument too -- the right of a criminal defendant to a public trial.
carolrosenberg	701786145630396416	2016-02-22T15:10:30	Perry notes that "Ms. Rosenberg" (me) tweeted it so it's already in the public record, redacting transcript does not erase that. Awkward
carolrosenberg	701785740364144640	2016-02-22T15:08:53	Perry: "We use the unauthenticated transcript every day," adds that government has to provide evidence of "danger to national security."
carolrosenberg	701785553293983748	2016-02-22T15:08:09	Perry adds they need order now on redacted Oct. 30 transcript and an order for going forward on no unilateral redaction of public record.
carolrosenberg	701785341267730433	2016-02-22T15:07:18	Perry: "Once it's in the public record, your honor has a role to play on whether it remains in the public record or not."
carolrosenberg	701785243125161984	2016-02-22T15:06:55	Pohl: But if it's properly classified, wouldn't the judge be ordering government to disclose classified information on the website.
carolrosenberg	701784970608689152	2016-02-22T15:05:50	Perry says prosecution has duty to 505H, request closed session and give "your honor that benefit of balancing" -- not unilaterally redact.
carolrosenberg	701784628873527296	2016-02-22T15:04:28	Perry says for Bin Attash this is a 6th Amendment right, not the First Amendment.
carolrosenberg	701784507217747968	2016-02-22T15:03:59	Perry seeks an "order disallowing that kind of action in the future," absent proper procedures.
carolrosenberg	701784326900477953	2016-02-22T15:03:16	Perry argues: "Government's conduct in this case of ex poste redacting the transcript should not be allowed."
carolrosenberg	701783872762224640	2016-02-22T15:01:28	Pohl is reviewing paperwork, asks a few questions: Is Perry U.S. citizen? Check; Has he signed non-disclosures? Check.
carolrosenberg	701783634999644160	2016-02-22T15:00:31	Edwin Perry, a civilian, is offering his detailing orders, and qualifications to the court.
carolrosenberg	701783441856188416	2016-02-22T14:59:45	Now we get to hear from Edwin Perry, Team Bin Attash No. 4, who has no clearance but gets to talk in court because no-clearance Schulz did.
carolrosenberg	701783101555548160	2016-02-22T14:58:24	Pohl: "When in doubt, file joinder."
carolrosenberg	701782937130377217	2016-02-22T14:57:45	Martins and Pohl and Nevin have a little discussion about whether there's automatic joinder of third-party motions.
carolrosenberg	701782722298126336	2016-02-22T14:56:54	Nevin for KSM says, as he understood the rule, he would have had to notice un-joinder if he didn't want to join the media motion.
carolrosenberg	701782429183381504	2016-02-22T14:55:44	Bormann says Bin Attash "has absolutely no objection to Mr. Perry or Maj. Seeger," participated in choice, selection, corresponded with him.
carolrosenberg	701782107983650816	2016-02-22T14:54:27	Ryan says the issue is, Can Bormann represent that Bin Attash wants Perry to argue for him?
carolrosenberg	701781925829222402	2016-02-22T14:53:44	Pohl agrees that Perry can argue "this one issue," after Bormann has said he's most skilled on the four-member team to handle the topic.
carolrosenberg	701781720052473856	2016-02-22T14:52:55	KSM and Bin Attash didn't joinder the media motion, assuming it was automatic, while Baluchi and Hawsawi automatically did.
carolrosenberg	701781553165246465	2016-02-22T14:52:15	Pohl and Bormann are doing an exchange of Whether to joinder or not to joinder and if it's automatic under Pohl's evolving policies.
carolrosenberg	701781375301586945	2016-02-22T14:51:32	Bormann says the Chief Defense counsel provides resources, and has given Bin Attash 4 attorneys -- one still awaiting a clearance, Perry.
carolrosenberg	701781212092825600	2016-02-22T14:50:54	Judge Pohl is reviewing right to defense counsel in this case, one detailed and one learned.
carolrosenberg	701780843929403394	2016-02-22T14:49:26	Perry has been detailed since June but is awaiting his clearance to work with the client. Bormann says they've been corresponding.
carolrosenberg	701780681735725056	2016-02-22T14:48:47	Prosecutor Ryan is opposing letting detailed defense attorney Edwin Perry argue AE400 because Bin Attash hasn't accepted him in court.
carolrosenberg	701780205967450112	2016-02-22T14:46:54	Schulz says "there clearly were inappropriate redactions” because they took second swipe with less redactions. 
carolrosenberg	701779539802923008	2016-02-22T14:44:15	Schulz wanted to give some before-and-after examples of less redacted 10/30 transcript. Pohl cuts him off, suggesting it could cause spill.
carolrosenberg	701778540941934592	2016-02-22T14:40:17	Schulz does a little lecture on the Snowden-leaked documents and if something is widely known, could be used publicly at trial.
carolrosenberg	701778116281298945	2016-02-22T14:38:35	The judge "decides whether the judicial record can be sealed" versus "the public's constitutional right to know what happened."
carolrosenberg	701777785879134209	2016-02-22T14:37:17	Schulz: "The judge does not declassify it, he has no power to declassify it" but he has to do a balancing act.
carolrosenberg	701777628454322177	2016-02-22T14:36:39	Schulz says once it's public, it's in a "zone where the public has a right to inspect."
carolrosenberg	701777327471120392	2016-02-22T14:35:27	Schulz says no but judge has a duty to make an independent judgment, has a "duty to protect the public's right to information."
carolrosenberg	701777114710859776	2016-02-22T14:34:37	Pohl asks Schulz if the judge has the authority to declassify.
carolrosenberg	701776926734688256	2016-02-22T14:33:52	That's the media position, Schulz says, but the government has to make a showing to the judge.
carolrosenberg	701776659347857408	2016-02-22T14:32:48	Pohl asks, essentially, if he as judge has the right to redact.
carolrosenberg	701776454670016513	2016-02-22T14:31:59	Schulz: "It should've been raised at that point in time. After the fact it's just too late."
carolrosenberg	701776380749594624	2016-02-22T14:31:42	Schulz notes that this information came up on open court without objection. He reminds that nobody pushed red mute button in court either.
carolrosenberg	701775582015709184	2016-02-22T14:28:31	No, replies Schulz, but 'the public has a constitutional right of a transcript of that statement.'
carolrosenberg	701775406978957312	2016-02-22T14:27:50	Pohl: If something classified is said in open court, does it somehow declassify it?
carolrosenberg	701775283402182660	2016-02-22T14:27:20	Schulz on  term unauthenticated: "Whether it's called a transcript or a hamburger, it is a judicial transcript taken down word for word."
carolrosenberg	701774814529376256	2016-02-22T14:25:28	Schulz: "There can't be a procedure that says the govt can rewrite history or conceal things from the public after the fact in this case."
carolrosenberg	701774454112841729	2016-02-22T14:24:02	Judge Pohl called it: "This thing” the government “has chosen to put on the website.”
carolrosenberg	701774383384281088	2016-02-22T14:23:45	Pohl clearly doesn’t see unauthenticated transcript as authoritative...
carolrosenberg	701773348263616512	2016-02-22T14:19:39	Pohl: There's no judicial review of what goes on a website. Schulz: Same in civilian courts.
carolrosenberg	701773174975938560	2016-02-22T14:18:57	Pohl argues that the government has chosen, on its own, to put "nonverbatim transcripts on its website."
carolrosenberg	701773037985726465	2016-02-22T14:18:25	Pohl is asking about "the transcript," with finger quotes, notes the judge has a role of authenticating the official transcript.
carolrosenberg	701772901213675520	2016-02-22T14:17:52	Schulz: It's in the rules. Pohl: Where? Schulz: Regulation for Trials by Military Commission 19-4.
carolrosenberg	701772740160786432	2016-02-22T14:17:14	Pohl to Schulz: Does it make a difference that the court has "zero role" on what is placed on the Pentagon website?

carolrosenberg	701772145110753281	2016-02-22T14:14:52	He says the government "may not unilaterally censor the record after the fact, as it's done here."
carolrosenberg	701772033106038784	2016-02-22T14:14:25	Schulz argues "The public has a constitutional right to the transcript...
carolrosenberg	701771878038421504	2016-02-22T14:13:48	Schulz says he is opposing after the redaction, censorship of open hearing, after some five hours of open-court testimony.
carolrosenberg	701771583459893248	2016-02-22T14:12:38	We now see attorney Schulz at the lectern, launching into his argument. Judge remind him to "slow down so we can get the translation in."
carolrosenberg	701771365628698624	2016-02-22T14:11:46	Judge Pohl overrules Martins, says Perry can put his detailing details into the record and indeed argue for Bin Attash on this one.
carolrosenberg	701771150528016385	2016-02-22T14:10:55	Prosecutor BrGen. Martins objects, says Perry doesn't have SCIF clearance, adds Schulz is arguing with plan to cover up all secret evidence.
carolrosenberg	701770725804404736	2016-02-22T14:09:13	For Bin Attash, Cheryl Bormann asks to bring in her fourth team attorney Edwin Perry, awaiting clearance, to argue their side of AE400.
carolrosenberg	701770543050203140	2016-02-22T14:08:30	Now Pohl says he'll hear media motion AE400 from attorney Dave Schulz, now in the gallery. . 
carolrosenberg	701770136194301953	2016-02-22T14:06:53	Judge Pohl declares both absences "free and knowing waiver" of right to be present today.
carolrosenberg	701770030468481025	2016-02-22T14:06:28	KSM waived, the major said, and indicated he wants to attend this afternoon's hearing.
carolrosenberg	701769873278509056	2016-02-22T14:05:50	"The reason he is not coming is because of the present of the attorneys Cheryl Bormann and Michael Schwartz on my defense team."

carolrosenberg	700436822632046592	2016-02-18T21:48:46	KSM's attorney Nevin asks for time in court to take a photograph... Judge Pohl is worrying about whether it will extend the guards' day.
carolrosenberg	700435407771664384	2016-02-18T21:43:09	Judge and lawyers are wrapping up day ahead of closed 505H session to discuss classified information.
carolrosenberg	700433554988253185	2016-02-18T21:35:47	Groharing: If there was info about treatment of 911 accused under the redactions, prosecution would provide it through discovery.
carolrosenberg	700432727238176768	2016-02-18T21:32:30	Connell: Prosecution's parsing applicable info "unbelievably close." He says mentions of his client, real client, are partly redacted.
carolrosenberg	700432429572603904	2016-02-18T21:31:19	Groharing says defense can request to talk to people who were involved in EITs, but not through this ZeroDarkThirty motion avenue.
carolrosenberg	700432170121302016	2016-02-18T21:30:17	Groharing says the redacted info includes identities of the real CIA people who were involved with "the movie people," that's classified.
carolrosenberg	700431776414625793	2016-02-18T21:28:43	Groharing says the defense lawyers have, via FOIA, all the discussion of what the CIA said to the Hollywood people.
carolrosenberg	700429722686263296	2016-02-18T21:20:33	Plus Nevin says the film is relevant to the trial because it was shown to the world, available to future jury, and influential politicians.
carolrosenberg	700429287531352066	2016-02-18T21:18:50	Nevin says the redactions may cover up potential witnesses in their pretrial investigation.
carolrosenberg	700428906298503172	2016-02-18T21:17:19	Nevin declares himself perplexed that the material withheld was not communication, but says the emails were by definition communication.
carolrosenberg	700428688987439110	2016-02-18T21:16:27	KSM attorney Nevin says Prosecutor Groharing suggested he only reviewed the FOIA material, and government should "make a wider search."
carolrosenberg	700428050215931905	2016-02-18T21:13:55	The CIA-filmmaker docs provide him "a window into" what went on. He invokes a Harf email that suggests filmmakers got "a deep dive."
carolrosenberg	700427508320223233	2016-02-18T21:11:45	Pohl asks won't he get that in RDI discovery? Connell says CIA folks seemed to describe to filmmakers what operatives felt, wants that.
carolrosenberg	700427094115938305	2016-02-18T21:10:07	Connell says that's part of it. He says he's less interested in the moviemakers than the CIA side of the discussions, descriptions.
carolrosenberg	700426874590248960	2016-02-18T21:09:14	Connell says he wants a CIA IG report, unredacted emails and... Pohl cuts him off, asks: Is this to verify the treatment of your client?
carolrosenberg	700426202436280321	2016-02-18T21:06:34	Court back in session. Judge Pohl is questioning Connell about the sought ZeroDarkThirty discovery.
carolrosenberg	700422678025523200	2016-02-18T20:52:34	We're in the afternoon recess.
carolrosenberg	700418087196237824	2016-02-18T20:34:19	Groharing is saying he looked at redacted info from the ZeroDarkThirty FOIA that Connell wants unredacted and says it's not relevant.
carolrosenberg	700417647096291328	2016-02-18T20:32:34	Pohl to Groharing: These documents exist or don't exist? Groharing: We examined them and they don't have comms between CIA and filmmakers.
carolrosenberg	700417434965143552	2016-02-18T20:31:44	Connell tries to shed light: Docs sought are emails and memos describing communications between the CIA and filmmakers of ZeroDarkThirty.
carolrosenberg	700416875126194177	2016-02-18T20:29:30	Groharing: No. Pohl: We're talking about emails that went from the CIA to filmmakers. (Judge is clearly confused, and so am I.)
carolrosenberg	700416639486005248	2016-02-18T20:28:34	Groaharing notes emails in the redacted FOIA contain classified information. Pohl, surprised: "Did Bigelow and Boal have a clearance?"
carolrosenberg	700416204578648064	2016-02-18T20:26:50	Seems Groharing is telling the judge he examined redacted emails released through FOIA and found nothing more than redacted FOIA.
carolrosenberg	700415486538993664	2016-02-18T20:23:59	Pohl points to emails that Connell provided as examples, asks Groharing are you saying these don't exist?
carolrosenberg	700415275884285957	2016-02-18T20:23:09	Groharing: Well, no... Of those docs furnished to prosecution 'there were no communications between CIA and filmmakers in Zero Dark Thirty.'
carolrosenberg	700415008073781248	2016-02-18T20:22:05	Pohl: You are standing there to tell me there is no email traffic between the email and the filmmakers relevant to this motion.
carolrosenberg	700414852536393729	2016-02-18T20:21:28	Groaharing says he examined emails, apparently those located through FOIA, and found no communication between the CIA and the filmmakers.
carolrosenberg	700414489385136128	2016-02-18T20:20:01	Now we know who objected. Case prosecutor Jeffrey Groharing is arguing against the motion.
carolrosenberg	700413945635610625	2016-02-18T20:17:52	Pohl: To show what? That CIA gave information to the filmmakers. Connell: Not now, but motion later that CIA did this to pollute the pool.
carolrosenberg	700413695508217856	2016-02-18T20:16:52	Jay Connell agrees this is not a documentary, argues he is entitled to see information that the CIA gave the filmmakers.
carolrosenberg	700413386975277056	2016-02-18T20:15:39	We have an unseen prosecution voice, unclear who on team: "I would just note that this is a movie, not a documentary." Pohl: Overruled.
carolrosenberg	700413177838878720	2016-02-18T20:14:49	Jay Connell says this claim was in film ZeroDarkThirty two years before the CIA made this claim publicly.
carolrosenberg	700412885265182722	2016-02-18T20:13:39	Now we are getting clip "Abu Ahmad al Kuwaiti," film shows character Ammar spilling beans on this kunya for Bin Laden courier.
carolrosenberg	700412409731751936	2016-02-18T20:11:46	Apologies for the last deleted, make-no-sense tweet. I was interrupted mid-stream by an odd query.
carolrosenberg	700412166885806080	2016-02-18T20:10:48	Defense attorney Jay Connell now arguing The Water Cooler in the film closely mirrors the use or water and ice against his client.
carolrosenberg	700411016232960000	2016-02-18T20:06:13	Interrogator: "When was the last time you saw Bin Laden? When you lie to me I hurt you."
carolrosenberg	700410889481121792	2016-02-18T20:05:43	Next ZeroDarkThirty torture clip at Guantanamo war court: "The Water Cooler," no-board waterboarding. "In the end everybody breaks bro."
carolrosenberg	700409802753757185	2016-02-18T20:01:24	Connell argues that only CIA or Baluchi could've told filmmakers that happened to the real Ammar. Filmmakers didn't interview real Ammar.
carolrosenberg	700409565729452032	2016-02-18T20:00:28	Connell screens clip describing previously unknown interrogation technique called "The Mat" -- step off the mat and you get punished.
carolrosenberg	700409048466853892	2016-02-18T19:58:24	Connell switches from clip to slide showing ZeroDarkThirty's Ammar is based on his client -- KSM's nephew, captured in Karachi, etc.
carolrosenberg	700408416393687040	2016-02-18T19:55:54	Looks like we're watching whole torture scene: Dog collar, coffin-sized confinement box, reference to Walid. 
carolrosenberg	700407584734449666	2016-02-18T19:52:35	Film interrogator: "When you lie to me I hurt you ... you want the water again?... Give me a name." Ammar: "I don't know." Strung back up.
carolrosenberg	700407112913002497	2016-02-18T19:50:43	Now war court is screening ZeroDarkThirty film clip of a strung-up, tortured Ammar, then interrogation about Richard Reid.
carolrosenberg	700406218930712576	2016-02-18T19:47:10	Film character Ammar is tortured. Ammar al Baluchi defender Connell wants to get what filmmakers got. My 2013 story: 
carolrosenberg	700405225518211072	2016-02-18T19:43:13	Connell says he'll submit a disc. Pohl seems to regret it, notes it's already public available.  Now Connell gets to argue his 2013 motion.
carolrosenberg	700404837251416064	2016-02-18T19:41:40	Judge Pohl asks Connell if he wants film "Zero Dark Thirty" as exhibit in discovery request AE195. Connell: "Good idea."
carolrosenberg	700404243983900672	2016-02-18T19:39:19	Judge Pohl's new senior attorney adviser just popped a note up onto bench. Pohl glances over to his left: "Got it."
carolrosenberg	700403841049751553	2016-02-18T19:37:43	Judge Pohl just asked for argument on discovery request related to motion AE190. Connell: Even the topic of AE190 is classified. Nevermind
carolrosenberg	700399871019380736	2016-02-18T19:21:56	Martins says first, 'We have reviewed these memos,' then adds that they can have copies, possibly by tomorrow, of unredacted OLC memos.
carolrosenberg	700399660700147712	2016-02-18T19:21:06	At issue, OLC torture memos. Pohl asks if Prosecution has unredacted copies here at Gitmo for the judge to examine.
carolrosenberg	700399153210335232	2016-02-18T19:19:05	Prosecutor BG Martins said he'd "rather answer tomorrow" -- closed session to determine whether there needs to be a closed hearing.
carolrosenberg	700399062835732480	2016-02-18T19:18:44	Judge Pohl invokes instance of a FOIAed document with redactions that Defense wants unredacted, asks if all info blacked out is classified.
carolrosenberg	700398498815025152	2016-02-18T19:16:29	Prosecutor Martins is saying his side has the role of determining cumulative evidence for releasable discovery and knows its obligation.
carolrosenberg	700394878614769666	2016-02-18T19:02:06	...Dashing my hopes of attending the May 17 rcfp Freedom of the Press Awards event in NYC. Details here: 
carolrosenberg	700393612534816768	2016-02-18T18:57:04	Just in: The judge in Guantanamo's other active pretrial case, Hadi al Iraqi, has canceled April hearings. Next Hadi hearings: May 16-20.
carolrosenberg	700393133151019008	2016-02-18T18:55:10	BG Martins: We categorically reject the notion that we have to present every duplicate to you to see what's there, what's not.
carolrosenberg	700392985020796928	2016-02-18T18:54:34	Judge Pohl is now questioning Prosecutor BG Martins about the meaning of cumulative, and how to sort this out.
carolrosenberg	700391828726685697	2016-02-18T18:49:59	Bormann asked judge to decide what's cumulative, not leave it up to the prosecution to decide what he shouldn't see. DontKnowWhatYouDontKnow
carolrosenberg	700390368194523136	2016-02-18T18:44:11	Bormann: "This is the most restrictive discovery regime I have ever seen in my career."
carolrosenberg	700357669459226624	2016-02-18T16:34:15	Last two Connell slides, 2 more relevant quotes from SSCI Summary 
carolrosenberg	700389087228911616	2016-02-18T18:39:05	Bormann then cited Nuremberg trials of government-sponsored activity, then added that you can't equate RDI to Nazi Regime.
carolrosenberg	700388938305925120	2016-02-18T18:38:30	Bormann: The more people know about war crimes the more outrageous.
carolrosenberg	700388245608251393	2016-02-18T18:35:44	Pohl: Does government conduct become more outrageous the more people know about it?
carolrosenberg	700387964191424512	2016-02-18T18:34:37	911 pretrial hearing is back on today's issue of access to Black Site evidence. Defender Bormann is discussing definition of cumulative.
carolrosenberg	700384873601765377	2016-02-18T18:22:21	joshgerstein My guess is the quibble will be over "all."
carolrosenberg	700384432235094017	2016-02-18T18:20:35	AP reporting: Harry Truman was last president to visit U.S. Navy base Guantanamo, in 1948.
carolrosenberg	700365052298272768	2016-02-18T17:03:35	We're in lunch recess. Bormann to pick up her discovery categories substance argument after 1330. It's Potato Bar Day at Gold Hill Galley.
carolrosenberg	700364626312175616	2016-02-18T17:01:53	Defense entitled to know quantity of cables, number of recipients to demonstrate how many in government knew of use of "torture technique."
carolrosenberg	700364091559448576	2016-02-18T16:59:46	Bormann on likely "outrageous government conduct" argument says...
carolrosenberg	700361935066394624	2016-02-18T16:51:12	Bormann says Nashiri model doesn't work, "We need all of the information on all of the alleged co-conspirators" to map defense strategy.
carolrosenberg	700361563086131201	2016-02-18T16:49:43	Judge Pohl says prosecution ought to say why it's redacting specific info --personal info, cumulative-- and if they won't, he'll ask them.
carolrosenberg	700361348711124992	2016-02-18T16:48:52	Now Bin Atttash defender Bormann is asking judge for help understanding who did summaries, whether judge signed off on certain redactions.
carolrosenberg	700360497565138944	2016-02-18T16:45:29	Nevin refers to 619 pages coming from prosecution, calls them "summaries of summaries." Pohl reminds prosecution is going back, unredacting.
carolrosenberg	700360063639281664	2016-02-18T16:43:45	He wants it all, access to info about i.e. everybody's waterboarding, seems to agree with Pohl that some names might be redacted.
carolrosenberg	700359389803388928	2016-02-18T16:41:05	Nevin: Prosecution's AE397 says all EITs, conditions of confinement, treatment, transfer used on all 119 RDI detainees are unclassified.
carolrosenberg	700358180841373696	2016-02-18T16:36:16	Now for KSM, David Nevin arguing all the defense teams are entitled to all co-defendants statements, should be produced to each team.
carolrosenberg	700357559677534210	2016-02-18T16:33:48	BG Martins objects, interrupts: "We stipulate to factual maters within the report, not to opinions or conclusions."
carolrosenberg	700357401749426178	2016-02-18T16:33:11	Jay Connell says that means prosecution concedes individual's rectal rehydration, EIT-ing of his client Ammar al Baluchi, lying to media.
carolrosenberg	700357085549240320	2016-02-18T16:31:55	In court now, defense and prosecution haggling over meaning of prosecution stipulating to facts in SSCI "Torture Report" Executive Summary.
carolrosenberg	700356605670457344	2016-02-18T16:30:01	Pohl also put out there that, even if prosecution does get judge all proposed docs, substitutions by 9/30/2016, discovery is far from done.
carolrosenberg	700353797747511296	2016-02-18T16:18:51	Pohl to Martins: But what about in rebuttal or at sentencing? Prosecutor BG Martins declined to clarify.
carolrosenberg	700353584207106052	2016-02-18T16:18:01	Also from this morning: BG Martins appeared to tell the judge that prosecution would use 'no former RDI detainees in case in chief.'
carolrosenberg	700350136363384833	2016-02-18T16:04:19	BG Martins said they get the declassified OLC memos, and prosecutors are reading under the redactions to see what bits defense can read too.
carolrosenberg	700349620937957376	2016-02-18T16:02:16	Also got an interesting insight into prosecution thinking on how much 9/11 defense teams can see of Bush era White House, DOJ RDI memos...
carolrosenberg	700349285284651008	2016-02-18T16:00:56	Pohl asked the prosecutor if, for example, all four co-defendants' lawyers can see KSM's statements. Martins: Not automatically.
carolrosenberg	700348796836913152	2016-02-18T15:58:59	In advocating the consolidation scheme, BG Martins told Judge Pohl that the standard for discovery is "not mere theoretical relevance."
carolrosenberg	700348523959685120	2016-02-18T15:57:54	Also seeking to substitute, rather than provide original info, about enhanced interrogation techniques and some so-called "torture memos."
carolrosenberg	700348018135076865	2016-02-18T15:55:54	Chronologies of KSM and Co's three- and four-year travels through the CIA's Black Sites, where they were kept and how they were moved.
carolrosenberg	700347696868151296	2016-02-18T15:54:37	Instead, prosecution wants judge's OK to give 911 defense attorneys classified summaries, substitutions of info from black sites to include:
carolrosenberg	700347377991970816	2016-02-18T15:53:21	From court this ayem: Prosecution this week began dropping classified CIA black-site docs on judge it doesn't believe defense should see.
carolrosenberg	700346381811261440	2016-02-18T15:49:23	Judge interjects that he doesn't perceive the scheme to deny the defense the opportunity to argue for what's missing.
carolrosenberg	700346236814106624	2016-02-18T15:48:49	Connell notes that the prosecution model omits black-site debriefers, quotes his client as saying he saw perhaps 150.
carolrosenberg	700346050477953024	2016-02-18T15:48:04	In court right now Baluchi defender Jay Connell is trying to poke holes in the prosecution's discovery consolidation scheme.
carolrosenberg	700345217682173952	2016-02-18T15:44:46	This devolved, briefly, into exchange about defense protest of under-resourcing, clearance lags and prosecution pledge of 7-day-a-week work.
carolrosenberg	700344889226174465	2016-02-18T15:43:28	Why not provide precision in classification of some discovery docs? Trivett: "We hope to get the case done during the lives of living men."
carolrosenberg	700344674066788352	2016-02-18T15:42:36	Trivett says prosecution did catchall "Pending Classification Review" out of expedience, leaving Defense doc-by-doc OCA specificity...

carolrosenberg	700069659593338880	2016-02-17T21:29:48	KSM attorney Nevin to Pohl: It seems like what the government is telling you is that they are over-classifying these documents.

carolrosenberg	700066176043499521	2016-02-17T21:15:57	Pohl: It's an original document? What's it derivative of? Trivett: I can't get into a lot of detail on that?
carolrosenberg	700065764703862784	2016-02-17T21:14:19	Trivett calls this consistent with federal practice when there's voluminous info.
carolrosenberg	700065401468776449	2016-02-17T21:12:52	Trivett calls it "derivative classification," says there's nothing tentative about it, no plan to refine. Pohl: Why's it pending?
carolrosenberg	700063830630600705	2016-02-17T21:06:38	Trivett says the prosecution "may give the Display Only" option to defense attorneys, meaning accused can see but not keep them.
carolrosenberg	700062702006353920	2016-02-17T21:02:09	Trivett said "pending classification review" equals TOP SECRET or SECRET NO FORN and they plan to do more like that.

carolrosenberg	700055265236885507	2016-02-17T20:32:36	Pohl to Trivett: This is a processing issue unrelated to any misconduct in this commission case? Trivett: Yes.
carolrosenberg	700055108621565952	2016-02-17T20:31:58	Nevin wants to take testimony, examine the witness, rather than interpret Trivett's statement created from a conversation with someone else.

carolrosenberg	700054057323466754	2016-02-17T20:27:48	Trivett: "There is no indication that this inquiry is due to any commission-related misconduct on the part of Mr. Mohammed’s interpreter."

carolrosenberg	699996086740652032	2016-02-17T16:37:27	Judge Pohl says that the prosecution has backpedaled on that. Nevin replies that the timing of the reversal is interesting.

carolrosenberg	699985945525932032	2016-02-17T15:57:09	Judge Pohl just denied Bormann's motion to withdraw "without prejudice."
carolrosenberg	699985467920482306	2016-02-17T15:55:15	Judge Pohl: "That presents interesting issues that I'm not going to address right now."

carolrosenberg	699981240737394690	2016-02-17T15:38:27	Prosecutor says Bormann has demonstrated she's been "zealous" in her defense of Bin Attash, cautions against "manipulation of the system."
carolrosenberg	699980877657477120	2016-02-17T15:37:00	Ryan wonders aloud if there's a learned counsel in the wings, how long it would take replacement to gain his confidence, get up to speed.
carolrosenberg	699980696694218752	2016-02-17T15:36:17	Ryan says Sept. 11 case prosecutors are poised dump large amounts of vetted evidence on CIA blacksite program on the defense lawyers.

carolrosenberg	699980061697560576	2016-02-17T15:33:46	Prosecutor Ryan says this is about "complaints" by counsel about the way the U.S. treats "one of the biggest mass murderers in history."
carolrosenberg	699979588294803456	2016-02-17T15:31:53	Bormann said she has been proven wrong again and again in her advice to Bin Attash that she can protect the privilege. "I can't help him."
carolrosenberg	699979163244036096	2016-02-17T15:30:12	Judge Pohl puts on record that he didn't write the MCA, asks if her position implicates every defense counsel in this system.
carolrosenberg	699978860033654784	2016-02-17T15:28:59	Pohl asks if her basis would apply to any military commission defender. Yes, says Bormann, but maybe someone else could be more effective.
carolrosenberg	699978647827046400	2016-02-17T15:28:09	Bormann to Pohl on her bid to build trust: "I've tried my very hardest."
carolrosenberg	699978413390610434	2016-02-17T15:27:13	That ruling denied Bin Attash's request to fire Bormann, but Bormann says Bin Attash thought it was an open question until January.

carolrosenberg	699977088636424192	2016-02-17T15:21:57	Bormann is lecturing the judge on the need for indivisibility in a capital defense team.
carolrosenberg	699976864220254208	2016-02-17T15:21:04	Bormann says the judge created a "public spectacle" by summoning the new Maj. Seeger, "a junior lawyer," as she calls it to the lectern.
carolrosenberg	699976503480737793	2016-02-17T15:19:38	Now we have Pohl and Bormann parrying over role of client in motions practice, duty of lawyer to not file frivolous or damaging filings.
carolrosenberg	699976051628384256	2016-02-17T15:17:50	Bormann: "What I said to my client has been undermined by you." Pohl: "Now it's my fault... client has a role in which motions are filed."
carolrosenberg	699975851396493312	2016-02-17T15:17:02	Bormann scolds Pohl, says in October that the judge in error advised Bin Attash that he could control motion practice, not the lawyers.
carolrosenberg	699975519283081216	2016-02-17T15:15:43	Bormann reminds that Bin Attash's mother died, may she rest in peace, she says, and that exacerbated lack of trust, rupture.
carolrosenberg	699975278999818241	2016-02-17T15:14:46	"This is the only penal institution in the world that doesn't allow face to face meetings of family members with detainees." (US maybe.)
carolrosenberg	699975127648333824	2016-02-17T15:14:09	Bormann says Bin Attash has been incommunicado with no face-to-face meeting with family members, gets monitored ICRC letters.
carolrosenberg	699974865206571008	2016-02-17T15:13:07	Prosecutor Ryan objects, says Bormann is quoting privileged conversations with her client. Bormann: It was rhetorical. Pohl: Overruled.
carolrosenberg	699974675502395393	2016-02-17T15:12:22	No phone calls with lawyers, withholding of laptops for a time with information on it, no access to "adequate medical care."
carolrosenberg	699974359809712128	2016-02-17T15:11:06	Bormann is trying to show pattern of interference broke the relationship, created perception of ineffective assistance of counsel.
carolrosenberg	699974316230885376	2016-02-17T15:10:56	Prosecutor Ryan objects, far afield. Judge Pohl overrules, leeway.
carolrosenberg	699974090707361792	2016-02-17T15:10:02	Bormann is reciting problems with meeting Bin Attash, and prosecution intervention to help her get meetings.
carolrosenberg	699973792584617984	2016-02-17T15:08:51	Judge Pohl parries: So this is reason to withdraw?
carolrosenberg	699973670551351297	2016-02-17T15:08:22	Bormann says it's cumulative, invokes the former CIA interpreter turning up on Bin al Shibh team -- says it "retraumatized" Bin Attash.
carolrosenberg	699973383136608256	2016-02-17T15:07:14	Judge Pohl: You are making a "global attack on the system," says he sorted out these items step by step, adds FBI had duty to investigate.
carolrosenberg	699972972140957696	2016-02-17T15:05:36	"He can't trust us, he can't believe us," says Bormann, adds Bin Attash is not allowed to know "the evidence of his torture."
carolrosenberg	699972737293537280	2016-02-17T15:04:40	Now Bormann is reciting a history of perceived invasion of the attorney-client privilege at the detention center, meeting rooms, court.
carolrosenberg	699972422850764800	2016-02-17T15:03:25	Prosecutor Ryan objects, says she's arguing another motion. Pohl overrules.
carolrosenberg	699972166331338752	2016-02-17T15:02:23	Bormann notes Bin Attash was in CIA/US military incommunicado since 2003, "When I met him in 2011 he was already a damaged human being."
carolrosenberg	699971843504136196	2016-02-17T15:01:06	Bormann, in abaya, tells judge that the way death-penalty defense works is "We operate as a singular indivisible team."
carolrosenberg	699971688247750656	2016-02-17T15:00:29	Bormann invokes the handling of this issue and the history of this case, says she's been communicating with Bin Attash through to January.
carolrosenberg	699971449663156224	2016-02-17T14:59:33	Bormann says she doesn't believe there's good cause for her removal but says after what happened yesterday "I don't really have a choice."
carolrosenberg	699971340045045760	2016-02-17T14:59:06	But, wait!, no Bih Attash stays because Bormann says she's moving to withdraw from the case.
carolrosenberg	699971201247158273	2016-02-17T14:58:33	Pohl: "No one's forcing you to leave, no one's forcing you to go anywhere." Pohl orders Bin Attash removed, kept in outside in holding cell.
carolrosenberg	699970609078538245	2016-02-17T14:56:12	Bin Attash: "I would like to stay but the reason I want to leave is the attorneys are staying with me on the team."
carolrosenberg	699970527159574528	2016-02-17T14:55:53	Pohl clarifies: Is this voluntary or involuntary waiver?
carolrosenberg	699970379947843586	2016-02-17T14:55:18	Bin Attash asks to be returned to the prison, says he doesn't want to come, but really does want to come but he's avoiding violence, FCE.
carolrosenberg	699970173969809408	2016-02-17T14:54:28	Bin Attash announces that from now on he's boycotting his defense counsel, won't meet with them, won't consult with them.
carolrosenberg	699970084937330688	2016-02-17T14:54:07	That's BG John Baker who arrives Feb. 20, assigned to assign an independent counsel to help shape motion to reconsider firing them.
