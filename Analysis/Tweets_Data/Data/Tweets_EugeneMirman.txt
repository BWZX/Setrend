EugeneMirman	725393401231724545	2016-04-27T18:37:18	obama_speech Not really. But it's a little silly to claim someone has an advantage because they're a woman.
EugeneMirman	725393129470185472	2016-04-27T18:36:13	JJ4T12Win That's often true. But to bemoan someone being a woman as an advantage is pretty tone deaf.

EugeneMirman	725391476759240704	2016-04-27T18:29:39	AndyKindler maybe he can run as the "Home Improvement" of politics?
EugeneMirman	725390652263944192	2016-04-27T18:26:23	One way Trump could improve his image is by picking a Care Bear as his running mate, most likely either Funshine Bear or Love-A-Lot Bear.
EugeneMirman	725357376224768000	2016-04-27T16:14:09	Once Trump is nominated he's going to play the "mentally ill horse in human form" card 24/7.

EugeneMirman	722905806765555713	2016-04-20T21:52:29	Get_Jump I think that's a popular narrative but don't think that's true. Also, fracking is bad long-term, but decreases carbon short term.
EugeneMirman	722905174973362177	2016-04-20T21:49:59	Get_Jump I would love to do that, but not sure if Fox would.
EugeneMirman	722904702334083073	2016-04-20T21:48:06	Get_Jump I don't think my taxes would change that much under Bernie. That is not a factor. I just think Hillary is better.
EugeneMirman	722904368744271873	2016-04-20T21:46:47	Get_Jump Well, I have no idea if you are or aren't well off, but I assume you like Bernie because you think his policies are the best.
EugeneMirman	722904078481645568	2016-04-20T21:45:37	Get_Jump Oh my god, yes. Huge difference. Women's rights, education, abortion, minimum wage, climate change, etc.
EugeneMirman	722903784209276928	2016-04-20T21:44:27	Get_Jump I'm also confused. Do you think Hillary is giving me money to like her? Is that a thing you think is possible?
EugeneMirman	722903415177633793	2016-04-20T21:42:59	Get_Jump We don't need to agree, but I think it's odd to assume anyone has one reason for voting a particular way.
EugeneMirman	722903216497631232	2016-04-20T21:42:12	Get_Jump Most economists (liberal especially) think Bernie's proposals are well intentioned but fairly dangerous.
EugeneMirman	722902933054959616	2016-04-20T21:41:04	Get_Jump Well, if the most important thing to me was taxes, wouldn't I support GOP?
EugeneMirman	722901647765020674	2016-04-20T21:35:58	Get_Jump consolation, not consultation.
EugeneMirman	722901517838123010	2016-04-20T21:35:27	Get_Jump But I have done a great deal of research and reading on the candidates if that is any consultation.
EugeneMirman	722901274572664832	2016-04-20T21:34:29	Get_Jump Sorry. I lashed out from people saying I was fat &amp; stupid. You're not insufferable. I like Hillary more &amp; think she'd be better.

EugeneMirman	722891276429840384	2016-04-20T20:54:45	Random_Jelly  Well, it came from so many people just saying I was stupid and fat for voting for her.
EugeneMirman	722890342672904192	2016-04-20T20:51:03	Random_Jelly teddygumbril I think she'd make a better president. It's fine if you disagree.

EugeneMirman	722822657775910913	2016-04-20T16:22:05	SoulAisled The opposite - I believe an accomplished reporter who wrote about her for decades. You believe smears &amp; lies as fact. Lots do.

EugeneMirman	722656215608782850	2016-04-20T05:20:42	kraydiobelly I know you're a nice guy and though I don't know exactly who you are, we disagree. It's fine. Good luck with everything.
EugeneMirman	722655645531512833	2016-04-20T05:18:26	kraydiobelly I came from an event. I'm moving in May out of New York.
EugeneMirman	722653294624129024	2016-04-20T05:09:06	kraydiobelly It was the only "nice" clothes I had to wear to some event and you guys made fun of me for years for it.
EugeneMirman	722651432747429889	2016-04-20T05:01:42	kraydiobelly I have to go. I think you are thoughtful and we disagree. Good night.
EugeneMirman	722651298701643778	2016-04-20T05:01:10	kraydiobelly Yes, and when you tell someone who is foreign they aren't ordinary, it's dismissive and rude.
EugeneMirman	722650957008531457	2016-04-20T04:59:49	kraydiobelly I think we are taking about maybe different people. They are the people who tell me I'm wrong because I'm fat.
EugeneMirman	722650477813440518	2016-04-20T04:57:54	kraydiobelly Okay. That's your standard. If I support Hillary, no matter my experience, I'm wrong and establishment. I disagree.
EugeneMirman	722650070848561152	2016-04-20T04:56:17	kraydiobelly when I called someone sexist it was because they attacked a woman in my timeline in a sexist way. You didn't.
EugeneMirman	722649186840276992	2016-04-20T04:52:46	kraydiobelly As an immigrant, I didn't love being told I'm an outsider  and should be dismissed. Maybe you are too. I don't know.
EugeneMirman	722648666088042498	2016-04-20T04:50:42	kraydiobelly Well, I said both for different reasons. That guy said something sexist. You told me I'm not an "ordinary" person.
EugeneMirman	722647727004336129	2016-04-20T04:46:58	kraydiobelly Yes, I never thought you weren't thoughtful. I think you are and that we disagree.
EugeneMirman	722647539070185472	2016-04-20T04:46:14	kraydiobelly No, I mean people support candidates for various reasons. If you're very conservative you might like Cruz or maybe hate Trump.
EugeneMirman	722646787929088000	2016-04-20T04:43:15	kraydiobelly Obviously like you we both think we are not superficial but thoughtful.
EugeneMirman	722646679074291713	2016-04-20T04:42:49	kraydiobelly I think each candidate has supporters that are strongly thoughtful and also quite superficial.
EugeneMirman	722643205708255232	2016-04-20T04:29:00	kraydiobelly People vote for superficial reasons for every candidate. That's a weird opinion to not think that.
EugeneMirman	722636086749577216	2016-04-20T04:00:43	kraydiobelly Of course it's not. That's the thoughtless critique. There are other more serious disagreements.

EugeneMirman	722563702654775296	2016-04-19T23:13:05	kraydiobelly It was glib of me, but I actually mean anyone who calls Hillary a criminal and anyone who likes her uninformed, stupid or fat.
EugeneMirman	722557533211213826	2016-04-19T22:48:35	zaronow Stefan_BC also, I don't mean "no" - meant I don't know, but it is not exact.
EugeneMirman	722557293854859265	2016-04-19T22:47:37	zaronow Stefan_BC No, and it's all adjustable. The one I've seen before put Hillary closer to Sanders as well, and Sanders less central.
EugeneMirman	722555838951473153	2016-04-19T22:41:51	robynr666 Glad you enjoyed it.
EugeneMirman	722545830822092800	2016-04-19T22:02:04	robynr666 Also, it's fine. People have written much meaner today.
EugeneMirman	722545656863330304	2016-04-19T22:01:23	robynr666 I find it a very important factor. I don't find it overall the most important. It's fine we disagree. Do you hate Bernie too?
EugeneMirman	722544049425629184	2016-04-19T21:55:00	robynr666 teddygumbril Okay. Thank you for joining the conversation.
EugeneMirman	722520778156081152	2016-04-19T20:22:31	Atlanta! Tomorrow! 
EugeneMirman	722515754445381632	2016-04-19T20:02:34	Tonight! Nashville! 
EugeneMirman	722512308656848901	2016-04-19T19:48:52	jaketimmons27 I think we disagree &amp; it won't change. Definitely support Bernie in the primary &amp; I'll do it in the general if he's nominee.
EugeneMirman	722509884739162113	2016-04-19T19:39:14	IlyaMirman You can't trust everything on the web: 
EugeneMirman	722504037883604992	2016-04-19T19:16:00	radljost_ I am now a land immigrant and you can not chase me back to the waters you are polluting.
EugeneMirman	722503746958323712	2016-04-19T19:14:51	a_p_crowley Yes, it was me lashing out because I got mad at a Bernie supporter attacking another Bernie supporter for not supporting enough
EugeneMirman	722497134189088768	2016-04-19T18:48:34	michaelhilva it depends. I am either somewhat political or a fat fool. Maybe a bit of both?
EugeneMirman	722496991549267968	2016-04-19T18:48:00	a_p_crowley It's true. Depending who you like what I said it is accurate or inverted.
EugeneMirman	722496854890389504	2016-04-19T18:47:28	steveystyles Well, I brought it a little on myself by lashing out a bit originally. But yes, people are more mean than thoughtful.
EugeneMirman	722495939923943424	2016-04-19T18:43:50	olekdotcom Yes, it's not a great look. But it's an okay enough joke.
EugeneMirman	722495682272079872	2016-04-19T18:42:48	Stefan_BC I filled out a questionnaire once and it put me in the dead center, near Sanders. But I'm okay with us having a different opinion
EugeneMirman	722495009623179264	2016-04-19T18:40:08	smktty KillYrWinter Hi guys, replying now. Agreed that she has made mistakes. They both have!
EugeneMirman	722494261636108289	2016-04-19T18:37:09	27knives Thanks, Jake.
EugeneMirman	722494079884337153	2016-04-19T18:36:26	Please join me on 5/25 For this excellent grist event! Maybe we can help stop a little deforestation? 
EugeneMirman	722492829369376768	2016-04-19T18:31:28	Amazing! I have been told I am fat by strangers the exact amount of times that it takes to change someone's mind politically.
EugeneMirman	722492238559744000	2016-04-19T18:29:07	DMoneyYall I think abortion, gun control, wages, eduction, healthcare need to be fought for regardless of whether finance can be fixed now.
EugeneMirman	722490856930840577	2016-04-19T18:23:38	jaketimmons27 Well, it's almost impossible to agree on the facts. If you think Barney Frank is uninformed then we're at a crossroads.
EugeneMirman	722489836582490112	2016-04-19T18:19:34	mbs26385 I'm not sure either. I might have tweeted something else that you liked or agreed with? Anyway, I wish you well! Goodbye for now.
EugeneMirman	722489459527131136	2016-04-19T18:18:05	Imontwitte Yes, I know. Many people I know like Bernie. And you're welcome! You are nice and thoughtful, so thank you!
EugeneMirman	722488974090997760	2016-04-19T18:16:09	red_mercer I don't know, though I think it's very divided amongst cast/ writers. Some love Bernie, some Hillary.
EugeneMirman	722487826739122176	2016-04-19T18:11:35	JortsAuthority Gene isn't autistic. But always glad to be disqualified from an opinion.
EugeneMirman	722487548077957120	2016-04-19T18:10:29	Imontwitte I think so, but we'll see.
EugeneMirman	722485664185458688	2016-04-19T18:03:00	shanevader Okay. I will stop. Sorry.
EugeneMirman	722484905926664192	2016-04-19T17:59:59	Imontwitte I think Trump or Cruz are the real threats. I don't think Hillary &amp; Bernie are so different. I like her more, you like Bernie.
EugeneMirman	722483234270003200	2016-04-19T17:53:20	typkrft I mostly took offense at the idea that because I'm a comedian I was somehow given it and never experienced difficulty.
EugeneMirman	722482966363054082	2016-04-19T17:52:16	typkrft Right. That's fair. And I'm from the Soviet Union and I understand the danger of ideologues. We're both right.
EugeneMirman	722482471229603841	2016-04-19T17:50:18	Imontwitte No it wasn't. It was all the economists that say he'd devastate the poor. &amp; other stuff. But I would support him if he's nominee
EugeneMirman	722481875734904832	2016-04-19T17:47:56	DWGreviews Well, I was satirizing that point.
EugeneMirman	722481659791208448	2016-04-19T17:47:05	typkrft Yes, what could an immigrant from another country possibly know about work in a field with no connections?
EugeneMirman	722481065873580032	2016-04-19T17:44:43	AndrewAKessler I'm not sure she does as much as people claim. I think it's largely decades of vilification 
EugeneMirman	722479116491075584	2016-04-19T17:36:59	sdcnu Yes, but don't most business spend money on their business?
EugeneMirman	722478823426666496	2016-04-19T17:35:49	thatsnotkosher I'm being a bit dramatic. But it was inspired by a Bernie supporter attacking another supporter for not supporting enough.
EugeneMirman	722476788677505024	2016-04-19T17:27:44	lartaw Kenny_Hughes_ Maybe? Or in the cabinet. I'm not sure what would be needed for the VP and don't know the various choices.
EugeneMirman	722476477254606848	2016-04-19T17:26:29	AndrewAKessler It actually doesn't appear like laws were broken. But she's put up with years of attacks and I think is quite strong.
EugeneMirman	722476195393245184	2016-04-19T17:25:22	kaiser_stephen It's true, sometimes 11 year olds have to choose between which 76 year old they agree with.
EugeneMirman	722475761001750528	2016-04-19T17:23:39	AndrewAKessler Colin Powell did the same thing. So did others. No one cared. Still don't. People only care about Hillary doing it.
EugeneMirman	722474714040516608	2016-04-19T17:19:29	elpacoverde Oh, right. I'll try to come closer then.
EugeneMirman	722473681486749697	2016-04-19T17:15:23	ThirdProject Gene's joyful soul would never let in that kind of spiteful anger.
EugeneMirman	722473289570992130	2016-04-19T17:13:49	kaiser_stephen He was very tempted to go for Bernie because of Bernie's love of Vampire Weekend. But in the end he listened to Barney Frank
EugeneMirman	722472538585047040	2016-04-19T17:10:50	elpacoverde Well, you can come tonight.
EugeneMirman	722471835703631872	2016-04-19T17:08:03	beanosimmons Never. He is a beautiful mind and a joyful soul.
EugeneMirman	722470786129338369	2016-04-19T17:03:52	Is anyone really surprised that Gene grows up to support Hillary?
EugeneMirman	722469635145252864	2016-04-19T16:59:18	Kenny_Hughes_ lartaw Well, I think this disagreement is why we all get to vote. But the real fight will be in November I think.
EugeneMirman	722465915086868480	2016-04-19T16:44:31	elpacoverde I'd love to return soon, but no plan now.
EugeneMirman	722465436315426816	2016-04-19T16:42:37	lartaw The truth is I don't like ideologues and like people who make hard compromises but move things forward. I think she's better at that
EugeneMirman	722465219562176513	2016-04-19T16:41:45	lartaw Yes, I really think she'll make a better president, but I also love that Bernie has brought a lot of important stuff to mainstream.
EugeneMirman	722465020546711552	2016-04-19T16:40:58	englishjg Thanks!
EugeneMirman	722464391711612928	2016-04-19T16:38:28	AndrewAKessler And I like someone who is resilient for 3 decades of smears and attacks. So, we cancel each other out!
EugeneMirman	722460731866771456	2016-04-19T16:23:55	jaketimmons27 Well, or like someone who disagrees with you. I don't think Bernie supporters are uninformed. I just think Hillary is better
EugeneMirman	722460277665591297	2016-04-19T16:22:07	Nashville! I am performing tonight with RobynHitchcock at the Exit/In  
EugeneMirman	722459187121430529	2016-04-19T16:17:47	Excellent and agreed. 
EugeneMirman	722457778355376128	2016-04-19T16:12:11	lartaw You are right. I just lashed out because a Bernie supporter was attacking another Bernie supporter for not supporting enough.
EugeneMirman	722452433281024002	2016-04-19T15:50:57	Nashville! I am coming tonight!
EugeneMirman	722452153000980485	2016-04-19T15:49:50	lartaw Obviously don't answer my question, since whether you and your family are rich or poor, your opinion is valid.
EugeneMirman	722448774086397953	2016-04-19T15:36:24	lartaw How old are you and what is yours? And your parents?
EugeneMirman	722442892502032384	2016-04-19T15:13:02	lartaw I'm not worth 2 million at all. That's some lie on the Internet.
EugeneMirman	722439034069319681	2016-04-19T14:57:42	rossaaaanderson flungoutofspace Well, no one was suggesting you vote for "any" woman, so it is sexist to jump into a conversation w/ that.
EugeneMirman	722438488126201858	2016-04-19T14:55:32	SeanMcElwee It's too bad you didn't list your job instead, unless you happen to be a teacher or nurse also.
EugeneMirman	722434923840151557	2016-04-19T14:41:22	ThomasWincek I did it in the general, but in Mass, so same difference. I would not have done it in a swing state.
EugeneMirman	722434397773803520	2016-04-19T14:39:17	don_riyxote samuel_isadore Odd_Hack HyperEntity Okay, bye guys.
EugeneMirman	722432861874184193	2016-04-19T14:33:11	teddygumbril 100% agree.
EugeneMirman	722432684820029441	2016-04-19T14:32:28	ThomasWincek It was like voting for a Nader I disagreed with for the purpose of creating more political competition.
EugeneMirman	722432429227544576	2016-04-19T14:31:27	ThomasWincek I know.
EugeneMirman	722432172905246725	2016-04-19T14:30:26	ThomasWincek I voted for Perot in 1992 in Mass (where Clinton was going to win) to try and help there be a 3rd party. But I agree.
EugeneMirman	722431674609311744	2016-04-19T14:28:28	SpencerDennison Yes, my tweet was originally inspired by an uber-Bernie supporter attacking another Bernie supporter.
EugeneMirman	722430940648071168	2016-04-19T14:25:33	teddygumbril I guess the answer is, in the end, it wasn't the most important factor for me.
EugeneMirman	722430771923783681	2016-04-19T14:24:52	RileyHMetcalfe That's fair. I did lash out. But it was from seeing Bernie supporters attack in other Bernie supporters.
EugeneMirman	722430466964332544	2016-04-19T14:23:40	dreamsofspeech Well, he's a friend of mine.
EugeneMirman	722430341164572673	2016-04-19T14:23:10	SpencerDennison Meaning that also supported him or opposing people who attacked you?
EugeneMirman	722430196947615745	2016-04-19T14:22:35	CateCosburn I will try to make one.
EugeneMirman	722429924779294720	2016-04-19T14:21:30	don_riyxote samuel_isadore Odd_Hack HyperEntity Well, it was a joke, but about you probably and not Hillary.
EugeneMirman	722429682684022785	2016-04-19T14:20:33	bumpasaurus HyperEntity Yes, of course. I know that I'm sharing an opinion that would hurt me economically.
EugeneMirman	722429369273024512	2016-04-19T14:19:18	Sorry I called some of you insufferable when you are just thoughtful and passionate. Not sorry to those that are actually insufferable.
EugeneMirman	722428537706164224	2016-04-19T14:16:00	bumpasaurus HyperEntity Not any longer!
EugeneMirman	722428089632882689	2016-04-19T14:14:13	pizza_dad69 You left out Susan Sarandon.
EugeneMirman	722425429961744385	2016-04-19T14:03:39	HyperEntity You don't have a monopoly on caring. Just because we disagree how things will get better.
EugeneMirman	722425147177639936	2016-04-19T14:02:31	Stefan_BC HyperEntity If taxes were my reason why would I not support GOP? Difference between Hillary &amp; Bernie for my taxes is negligible
EugeneMirman	722424890494595073	2016-04-19T14:01:30	HyperEntity I think they largely are actually. Seattle, San Francisco, NY and California all wealthy and passed that.
EugeneMirman	722422303066300416	2016-04-19T13:51:13	hazelhexel I'm about to get up and head to Nashville. So it's been okay so far. A lot of Twitter arguments. Hope yours is good.
EugeneMirman	722420436370386944	2016-04-19T13:43:48	JenKirkman michaelianblack Glad to help! Let me know if it ever dies down and you need someone to call you a cunt in an emergency.
EugeneMirman	722420014826065920	2016-04-19T13:42:08	flungoutofspace It's so crazy the venom towards supporting arguably the most qualified candidate in a long time is.
EugeneMirman	722418227939303426	2016-04-19T13:35:02	flungoutofspace Well, you have to understand, I'm a fat corporate shill, so a lot of what I say is wrong.
EugeneMirman	722416562146275328	2016-04-19T13:28:24	I take back what I said. This is exactly the kind of reasoned argument that's made me finally FeelTheBern 
EugeneMirman	722413226986770432	2016-04-19T13:15:09	SerpentineMelod No, it's time to embrace our ideals, fight for progress and not worship false idols.
EugeneMirman	722409820586930176	2016-04-19T13:01:37	stolenbyaliens Maybe? Vote well! (Or for whoever you already like).
EugeneMirman	722409015125401602	2016-04-19T12:58:25	HyperEntity No, like condescending upper-middle class know-it-all liberals. (I don't mean you or anything, but those folks attack me a lot)
EugeneMirman	722406221496643584	2016-04-19T12:47:19	yoyoitsdNo robdelaney You should save this for when Bernie or Hillary are running against Trump. Then you can sway independents.
EugeneMirman	722404632664883201	2016-04-19T12:41:00	Lemuriapop Fair enough.
EugeneMirman	722403927346528257	2016-04-19T12:38:12	SteveDelfino robdelaney No, it's probably the most frustrated/ angry thing I've tweeted. Sorry if I hurt you.
EugeneMirman	722403561028640768	2016-04-19T12:36:45	robdelaney Thanks! I've seen what you've written as well and really enjoyed it. imwithyou/her
EugeneMirman	722309209405190144	2016-04-19T06:21:50	dbreunig Honestly, I'm bought and paid for by Big Solar, so take everything I say with a grain of Himalayan Sea Salt.
EugeneMirman	722301767841615872	2016-04-19T05:52:15	milkpaste Okay, so when I go to this link, there are 206 passed, but he doesn't seem to be a sponsor of many: 
EugeneMirman	722299718592827392	2016-04-19T05:44:07	milkpaste Sort of. He sponsored or cosponsored very few that passed. 3 I think. It's not his strong suit. But Hillary has a similar record.
EugeneMirman	722297927713058816	2016-04-19T05:37:00	milkpaste Those are virtually all bills referred to committee, not passed. He's great at taking a stand and terrible at passing bills.
EugeneMirman	722295540361375744	2016-04-19T05:27:31	johnroderick I think everyone can.
EugeneMirman	722294752582967296	2016-04-19T05:24:23	milkpaste It's both of them. It's okay to like one more than the other. I think you should vote for Bernie.
EugeneMirman	722292951058092032	2016-04-19T05:17:13	atlanticspitty mshowalter But honestly, without believing all the dumb lies and decades of smears, she does: 
EugeneMirman	722288979366830080	2016-04-19T05:01:26	atlanticspitty mshowalter Isn't that what integrity is? Saying what you think regardless of profit?
EugeneMirman	722269382571880448	2016-04-19T03:43:34	michaelkoes Did you read it before just now? Or did you read part &amp; stop? I don't imagine it'll change anyone's mind, I just agree with it.
EugeneMirman	722269066073935872	2016-04-19T03:42:19	grafiikdesign davyshaps12 Not really. I think it's long and thoughtful.
EugeneMirman	722266317655511040	2016-04-19T03:31:23	Honestly, this is very long, but it is an excellent read:  
EugeneMirman	722263875924570112	2016-04-19T03:21:41	grinsfelder No, they can only dislike them.
EugeneMirman	722263155137585153	2016-04-19T03:18:49	dubbsesque Thanks!
EugeneMirman	722263071171829760	2016-04-19T03:18:29	Guys, I have a specific way that I'm liberal and if you disagree with me it means that you are conservative and hate the poor.
EugeneMirman	722262728098729985	2016-04-19T03:17:08	dubbsesque Sorry, we aren't there anymore! You can get a pic I guess next time.
EugeneMirman	722257902539534337	2016-04-19T02:57:57	IPetFudge Vote for Cruz if that is where your heart is.
EugeneMirman	722256031770763264	2016-04-19T02:50:31	KillYrWinter Yes, and you should absolutely vote for Bernie.
EugeneMirman	722254260050726912	2016-04-19T02:43:29	Skedoozy I know two people voting for Bernie because he has a penis.

EugeneMirman	715630729351200768	2016-03-31T20:03:56	lighthousejerry But I don't think it will be his focus. The truth is, I have no idea what he will actually do. It's why he's scary to me.
EugeneMirman	715630488933703680	2016-03-31T20:02:58	lighthousejerry I think he will try to nominate a conservative supreme court justice that will uphold new anti-abortion laws.
EugeneMirman	715619258097512448	2016-03-31T19:18:21	pwnerofnoobs That is totally true.
EugeneMirman	715616317223505920	2016-03-31T19:06:40	pwnerofnoobs Thank you!!
EugeneMirman	715616271983718400	2016-03-31T19:06:29	pwnerofnoobs That's true. But her time was much shorter. So I think Barney Frank's thoughts as a very outspoken liberal are reasonable.
EugeneMirman	715603182748045312	2016-03-31T18:14:28	pwnerofnoobs Right, so not great. And not "thousands." So Barney Frank has a point.
EugeneMirman	715601721444208641	2016-03-31T18:08:40	pwnerofnoobs I clicked on your link. That's where I'd been looking already. I'm right. I think around 3 bills passed? No?
EugeneMirman	715601336893571073	2016-03-31T18:07:08	obama_speech Well, there is rocking a boat and there is capsizing. If it was someone who was more trustworthy, I'd maybe feel different.
EugeneMirman	715601116013150208	2016-03-31T18:06:15	pwnerofnoobs That passed? I think a lot were referred to committee, but maybe I'm wrong. Or are they mostly amendments?
EugeneMirman	715596822719381504	2016-03-31T17:49:12	pwnerofnoobs What are 5 bills that passed that he was the chief sponsor of? And not amendments.
EugeneMirman	715594889833136128	2016-03-31T17:41:31	obama_speech There's a 60% chance he'll do all that &amp; there's a good chance he'll start a disastrous trade war with China. We'll find out!
EugeneMirman	715593949218471941	2016-03-31T17:37:47	I interviewed Greg Behrendt AndyKindler `dopequeenpheebs &amp; Janeane Garofalo! for a live podcast on SeesoTV! 
EugeneMirman	715592206598422529	2016-03-31T17:30:51	PithyJoe Someone has to be president. But you can also write in Tom Hanks. He seems pretty honest.
EugeneMirman	715588677418819584	2016-03-31T17:16:50	PithyJoe I guess I'd suggest Hillary. But do as your heart must.
EugeneMirman	715588463232491520	2016-03-31T17:15:59	jennieiw Somewhat, though 15-year-old girls are not getting pepper-sprayed at Bernie rallies. There's a lack of decency that Trump inspires
EugeneMirman	715578807986569217	2016-03-31T16:37:37	kwheel4 The moderate ones do.
EugeneMirman	715577964205891584	2016-03-31T16:34:16	@therealangrybad Well, not at 2 days. Not at one month. But yes at 7 months. I'm not saying I have the answer. It's somewhere in the middle.
EugeneMirman	715576734037446657	2016-03-31T16:29:22	@therealangrybad Well, I'd say an embryo isn't life, but a baby a month before birth is. I'm not the only 1 with trouble defining it's start
EugeneMirman	715575642557968386	2016-03-31T16:25:02	Trump sympathizers don't say, "How will he get that done?" They say, "Don't worry, he won't actually do that." About. Everything. He. Says.
EugeneMirman	715574226191839233	2016-03-31T16:19:24	@therealangrybad I'm not trying to change your mind. We fundamentally disagree on when life starts. Why try to convince you it starts later?
EugeneMirman	715573288991399936	2016-03-31T16:15:41	@therealangrybad You are very clear and not jabbing. We just disagree on when life starts.
EugeneMirman	715572867459649536	2016-03-31T16:14:00	@therealangrybad That's your definition not held as the standard by most people &amp; nations. We have a fundamentally different definition.
EugeneMirman	715571358483234821	2016-03-31T16:08:01	@therealangrybad How slightly? The day after possible inception? If so, then we just disagree on the definition of life &amp; it can't be helped
EugeneMirman	715524001850851328	2016-03-31T12:59:50	ProfitMoney No, there is a system of checks and balances and as said in this interview it often takes two elections to make a difference.
EugeneMirman	715522097834041344	2016-03-31T12:52:16	ProfitMoney BarneyFrank Slate I think change is a slow, hard process. Not a quick fix through unlikely promises.
EugeneMirman	715513336322998272	2016-03-31T12:17:27	Excellent interview with BarneyFrank 
EugeneMirman	715506265422692352	2016-03-31T11:49:21	CaveatEmptor365 says the privileged avatar probably lucky enough to be born in America.

EugeneMirman	715486989840044037	2016-03-31T10:32:46	Another possible punishment for women who get abortions: explain Pink Floyd's The Wall to a 7-year-old till they "get it."
EugeneMirman	715330797264379904	2016-03-31T00:12:06	And NYC - did I mention that SalmanRushdie IsaacMizrahi EugeneMirman &amp; many more are on  ? Very few tix left!
EugeneMirman	715314708107145217	2016-03-30T23:08:10	Maybe one fair way to punish women who have abortions is to have them raise a sack of flour, not just for a week, but for 10 years?

EugeneMirman	711596709424582657	2016-03-20T16:54:11	michaelianblack That's obviously Karl Marx in a disguise. Nice try, communist.
EugeneMirman	711589467908399105	2016-03-20T16:25:24	IPetFudge I think transparency is good and some amount of secrecy is necessary. But I have to go now! Nice chatting!
EugeneMirman	711589415928340481	2016-03-20T16:25:12	IPetFudge Well, I think it's very bad that Woodrow Wilson had a stroke &amp; it was kept secret &amp; he was president while strongly diminished.
EugeneMirman	711586973987827712	2016-03-20T16:15:29	EinDarri It'll all be traced back to a misunderstanding of a joke William McKinley made.
EugeneMirman	711584911866650625	2016-03-20T16:07:18	boyceaz I don't know. Maybe? I think jonronson did a documentary about him a while ago. Does Alex Jones believe the stuff he says?
EugeneMirman	711584471993196544	2016-03-20T16:05:33	IPetFudge I think there's a moderate amount of stuff behind closed doors that is kept secret, probably some reasonable &amp; some questionable.
EugeneMirman	711580333473456130	2016-03-20T15:49:06	IPetFudge Right, by "real plots" I meant it was something they actually did and executed several times.
EugeneMirman	711579845243904001	2016-03-20T15:47:10	IPetFudge Yes, though in my defense, I specifically refer to Alex Jones in my original tweet. It was pretty clear what I meant.
EugeneMirman	711579514623696896	2016-03-20T15:45:51	IPetFudge I'm using the term colloquially &amp; you're using it more literally. How would you suggest we divide them? What term do you suggest?
EugeneMirman	711578902251053060	2016-03-20T15:43:25	IPetFudge Well, I do, in my use of "conspiracy theory." But not at all by your use of the term. I just think mine's how most people use it.
EugeneMirman	711578615239065601	2016-03-20T15:42:17	IPetFudge Yes, but anti-vaxxers harm children. Anti-science climate change deniers, flat earthers, moon-landing deniers hurt progress too.
EugeneMirman	711577345472274432	2016-03-20T15:37:14	IPetFudge We're using the words differently to describe two vastly different things. Our disagreement is over the term.
EugeneMirman	711576914469756928	2016-03-20T15:35:31	IPetFudge unsubstaniated irrational thinking often rooted in racism/ antisemitism &amp; is destructive. You think it uncovers real CIA plots.
EugeneMirman	711576471517663234	2016-03-20T15:33:45	IPetFudge 1/2 We won't change each other's minds. I believe the term "conspiracy theories" refers to a very dangerous form of
EugeneMirman	711575435524612098	2016-03-20T15:29:38	IPetFudge That's what I'm talking about. Trump forwarding a "conspiracy theory" of Scalia's death is irresponsible and foolish.
EugeneMirman	711574793116639232	2016-03-20T15:27:05	IPetFudge I'm concerned with Trump quoting apocryphal emails, being endosed by Alex Jones and flirting fringe kookiness.
EugeneMirman	711574333882277888	2016-03-20T15:25:16	IPetFudge 2/2 and you think it disenfranchises people with genuine theories of real conspiracies. I guess we'll agree to disagree?
EugeneMirman	711574224704561152	2016-03-20T15:24:50	IPetFudge 1/2 I think we're arguing about the semantics of "conspiracy theory." I think I'm using the generally accepted use
EugeneMirman	711573731471138816	2016-03-20T15:22:52	IPetFudge I think you're using "conspiracy theories" too broadly. You just mean something that was once covered up, like Watergate.
EugeneMirman	711573045396283396	2016-03-20T15:20:09	IPetFudge Yes, they literally do. I am not dismissing ideas unknown or uninvestigated by the mainstream.
EugeneMirman	711572617556324352	2016-03-20T15:18:27	IPetFudge Show me two reasonable theories of anything on infowars. Freedom of speech is wonderful, but it does not validate stupidity.
EugeneMirman	711572401495080960	2016-03-20T15:17:35	IPetFudge Conspiracy theories generally refer to things that are outside of real, thoughtful investigation.
EugeneMirman	711571636881858560	2016-03-20T15:14:33	IPetFudge Sure, but they're often foolish explanations of 9/11, climate change, a nonsensical theory of a supreme court justice's death...
EugeneMirman	711568680702889986	2016-03-20T15:02:48	IPetFudge No really. Most things that fall under that are stupendously foolish &amp; hinder the addressing of real government deceit &amp; failure.
EugeneMirman	711566326398058497	2016-03-20T14:53:27	What will happen to conspiracy theories when Trump puts Alex Jones in his cabinet and Alex discovers that everything he believes is a lie?
EugeneMirman	711537241860997121	2016-03-20T12:57:52	You know what would finally end the brutal 5-way conflict in Syria? A president who talked just like Scott Baio.
EugeneMirman	711536327460839425	2016-03-20T12:54:14	Kpax1125 Worse.
EugeneMirman	711536101467496448	2016-03-20T12:53:20	partisanworduse Thanks! You should just do it and then do it over and over. It gets easier with time and practice.
EugeneMirman	711416153185370113	2016-03-20T04:56:43	Trump's weird strength is having people assume he's exactly whatever they hope he is. Even though he's basically an angry mop.

EugeneMirman	711247496501137408	2016-03-19T17:46:32	batfan0001 StarTalkRadio neiltyson I still feel special.
EugeneMirman	711236496695672832	2016-03-19T17:02:49	kwheel4 I think there's a difference between someone acting in a legal way you disagree with and not understanding the judiciary and bills.
EugeneMirman	711189541504335872	2016-03-19T13:56:14	dogberryjr There's a link to the article in the tweet that explains it. It's about a very broad anti-abortion law that was struck down.

EugeneMirman	711155791223369729	2016-03-19T11:42:07	AndyKindler Jokermtb It's true. Andy and I have toured together and shared lots of great laughs over many years.

EugeneMirman	710967031756099584	2016-03-18T23:12:04	Tonight’s new podcast: “Protecting Earth from Asteroids” w/ neiltyson, Rusty Schweickart &amp; eugenemirman. Listen: 
EugeneMirman	710884347138744322	2016-03-18T17:43:30	"He insults the office Abraham Lincoln once occupied by running for it with less preparation than most of us would undertake to buy a sofa."
EugeneMirman	710883591958478848	2016-03-18T17:40:30	bart_smith RobynHitchcock True. We will be the only representation the District of Columbia can rely on.
EugeneMirman	710883209039486982	2016-03-18T17:38:59	PeterBreitholtz Okay, you should I guess. Right?

EugeneMirman	710849856613576704	2016-03-18T15:26:27	mrsbrowngravy I never made one, but always consider it.
EugeneMirman	710849794089099264	2016-03-18T15:26:12	ruthiegsings True, but Hillary has just 2 pants on fire out of 140 fact-checked statements, and Bernie only has 40 statements checked.
EugeneMirman	710848854447542272	2016-03-18T15:22:28	HRH_Mommy Thanks! Say to your son for me!
EugeneMirman	710842001445494784	2016-03-18T14:55:14	Thrashdaddy66 Thanks!
EugeneMirman	710826598765821952	2016-03-18T13:54:02	PithyJoe If you read through each politician's statements, it's not all-inclusive of course, but actually fairly thorough on lots of topics
EugeneMirman	710824175036964864	2016-03-18T13:44:24	AdolfoGonzalez Well, it looks like it will be one of two people who lie close to the least against one of the people who lie the most.
EugeneMirman	710823324021071872	2016-03-18T13:41:01	Interesting article about how much politicians actually lie (from 2007 to today). Bernie &amp; Hillary tied at bottom. 
EugeneMirman	710821406544683008	2016-03-18T13:33:24	I know someone isn't sexist when I look at their timeline and it's full of tweets about how they're not sexist.
EugeneMirman	710819680156585984	2016-03-18T13:26:32	AndyKindler Maybe carry a rolled up Mort Sahl on stage and have him do the premise?
EugeneMirman	710818828431785984	2016-03-18T13:23:09	AndyKindler I didn't realize he was a 23 year old Bernie Bro! I still think you should save it for Montreal. It will still be topical!!
EugeneMirman	710817188324765696	2016-03-18T13:16:38	AndyKindler I'll get involved once it grows beyond attacking (regulated) Capitalism &amp; Michael. Once you start in on moderate newscasters.
EugeneMirman	710814663664148480	2016-03-18T13:06:36	Save it for Montreal. 
EugeneMirman	710635436268457984	2016-03-18T01:14:25	TheUlfsark Thanks!

EugeneMirman	710526988562341889	2016-03-17T18:03:29	JLowellBK I am the only one that is correct 86%!!!! (Also, not a pundit).
EugeneMirman	710526675432431616	2016-03-17T18:02:15	FisherBurton That is absolutely true.
EugeneMirman	710526314676162561	2016-03-17T18:00:49	FisherBurton Okay. I am bad with logic. I wish you the best, I have to go now.
EugeneMirman	710525906863984644	2016-03-17T17:59:11	FisherBurton I'm a moderate liberal and so I like Hillary. I also like Bernie. I'm happy to embrace the parts I like about each.
EugeneMirman	710525412061945856	2016-03-17T17:57:13	FisherBurton No, I majored in comedy. I wish I felt as cavalier about Hitler and Stalin as you. It must be nice though.
EugeneMirman	710524216064548864	2016-03-17T17:52:28	FisherBurton I think there's a big difference between Hillary and Trump and if you don't, that's fine.
EugeneMirman	710524121315151872	2016-03-17T17:52:06	FisherBurton Okay, that's fair enough. I'd say using Hitler and Stalin to make political points is dramatic, but maybe you don't.
EugeneMirman	710523182730625024	2016-03-17T17:48:22	FisherBurton Sorry, I guess I mean you are being histrionic in your comparisons. It isn't a vote between Democracy or Communism or Fascism.
EugeneMirman	710522168807923716	2016-03-17T17:44:20	FisherBurton (2/2) this one we're having out in the open? Bernie isn't Stalin, Hillary isn't Hitler, Trump is barely Mussolini.
EugeneMirman	710522065762328576	2016-03-17T17:43:55	FisherBurton 1/2 Have you (or friends or family) lived in a real dictatorship where you're genuinely afraid of having a conversation like
EugeneMirman	710521000031612928	2016-03-17T17:39:41	mpmt3102 YoLarryJohnson Salon Let's reconnect when both parties have chosen nominees and we can go from there.
EugeneMirman	710520513593012226	2016-03-17T17:37:45	FisherBurton Voting for Bernie or Hillary now is not embracing Trump. Not voting for either in the General is embracing him (or nominee).
EugeneMirman	710519770450411520	2016-03-17T17:34:48	The great thing about think pieces this far out is that they're all 100% correct until they're not at all.
EugeneMirman	710519156601442304	2016-03-17T17:32:22	hurrahmusic Salon No, it actually says to keep fighting, but it's not likely.
EugeneMirman	710518662374014977	2016-03-17T17:30:24	mpmt3102 YoLarryJohnson Salon I don't think that changes anyone's mind. Just like if Hillary polled higher, you wouldn't back her.
EugeneMirman	710517943541637120	2016-03-17T17:27:33	Crayz9000 RDPullins I didn't realize that. I'm sure if Bernie got the majority of the popular the vote they would not change the nominee.
EugeneMirman	710517582428823553	2016-03-17T17:26:07	FisherBurton Fair enough. I do think if in the General if you reject Hillary and embrace Trump that is a bad decision.
EugeneMirman	710517101207928832	2016-03-17T17:24:12	Crayz9000 RDPullins That's true. He absolutely might win 72% of delegates moving forward. Not likely, but totally possible.
EugeneMirman	710516920659931140	2016-03-17T17:23:29	FisherBurton I'm not judging you. I retweeted an article. I tweet lots of things that have interesting points but I don't agree with 100%.
EugeneMirman	710515768308404224	2016-03-17T17:18:54	FisherBurton Fair enough. But most people's replies were that they still support Sanders, so felt like not all read the article.
EugeneMirman	710515563529895936	2016-03-17T17:18:05	FisherBurton She's moved to the left on several things. But if Sanders supporters find Trump speaks to them more, they should vote for him.
EugeneMirman	710515206510809092	2016-03-17T17:16:40	FisherBurton Just in this one article.
EugeneMirman	710514961689288704	2016-03-17T17:15:42	cluckeryDuckery That makes sense.
EugeneMirman	710514716528025600	2016-03-17T17:14:43	FisherBurton Yes, that's all true. It's not mutually exclusive. Though it makes a great point about the Hispanic vote.
EugeneMirman	710513371473436674	2016-03-17T17:09:23	RichinMN Did you read it? The article says you should still vote for Bernie in the primary.
EugeneMirman	710513297351700486	2016-03-17T17:09:05	RDPullins Did you read it? The article says you should still vote for Bernie in the primary.
EugeneMirman	710513234919477253	2016-03-17T17:08:50	misspoo4ever Did you read it? The article says you should still vote for Bernie in the primary.
EugeneMirman	710435528089452544	2016-03-17T12:00:03	Sorry, Bernie. I’m with Hillary now: Listen up, fellow Bernie supporters—you must get behind Clinton to stop Trump

EugeneMirman	709051061919735809	2016-03-13T16:18:41	petersongeorged Okay! I'll look there too. I am curious. I don't think the info is as easily found by people who don't already agree.
EugeneMirman	709050082834915328	2016-03-13T16:14:47	petersongeorged Also, I mean nationally, since cities that can afford it, should definitely do it I think.
EugeneMirman	709049608060739584	2016-03-13T16:12:54	petersongeorged Okay, I guess start with links to why $15 minimum wage is better than $12 or $18.

EugeneMirman	708796760840392704	2016-03-12T23:28:11	Raazoul The good news is, the salute was more nuanced and neither side presented it right.

EugeneMirman	708727621199257600	2016-03-12T18:53:27	Raazoul Yes, but I think on a world stage Vince McMann could create unknowable economic and violent disasters.

EugeneMirman	708718149785526272	2016-03-12T18:15:48	Judge_Jay No, it is meant to evoke the image of an actual horse jumping around in a meeting with world leaders.

EugeneMirman	703328190572445696	2016-02-26T21:18:02	Blingfried Okay! Thank you for your thoughts. I'm going to go start making dinner now. Bye!
EugeneMirman	703328056568635393	2016-02-26T21:17:30	Blingfried My mail goal is to have people not say things like this, unless I guess you genuinely believe it: 
EugeneMirman	703326330981629952	2016-02-26T21:10:39	Blingfried Also, I'm not voting for President of Healthcare. I'm taking a lot more into account, though I think health care is important.
EugeneMirman	703325716230893568	2016-02-26T21:08:12	Blingfried I'm not saying she can't be criticized, but to say she doesn't want universal healthcare for all is just not the case.
EugeneMirman	703325595464290305	2016-02-26T21:07:43	Blingfried by someone who "cares" could be better, right? I think people dismiss Hillary's effort to help people over the years.
EugeneMirman	703325279641575424	2016-02-26T21:06:28	Blingfried You agree that there is a debate in policy? In the instance that Bernie's plan is not good, which is possible, another plan
EugeneMirman	703322903987822592	2016-02-26T20:57:02	Blingfried There's a big difference to me between saying someone's policy is wrong &amp; saying they don't care about it or want a solution.
EugeneMirman	703322533618176001	2016-02-26T20:55:33	Blingfried I also don't think they are disingenuous. They could be a faulty analysis, but I don't think they don't believe them.
EugeneMirman	703321079993991168	2016-02-26T20:49:47	Blingfried I'm saying the idea that one candidate cares and the other doesn't is just not the case.
EugeneMirman	703320977413959685	2016-02-26T20:49:22	Blingfried I think you're missing my point: I am not arguing which health care model is definitively the best.
EugeneMirman	703293503175049217	2016-02-26T19:00:12	This is pretty interesting. 
EugeneMirman	703289660559237121	2016-02-26T18:44:56	Blingfried My issue is with the black-and-white tone people take against Hillary that is often somewhat disingenuous or histrionic.
EugeneMirman	703288724927467520	2016-02-26T18:41:13	Blingfried I don't support one system over the other. I would need more info. I just don't deride either person as not wanting it.
EugeneMirman	703288555653746689	2016-02-26T18:40:32	Blingfried Sure:     
EugeneMirman	703283145446203395	2016-02-26T18:19:02	Blingfried I think everyone should have health care. I think it's either odd or disingenuous to say Hillary doesn't want that goal too.
EugeneMirman	703282720336703488	2016-02-26T18:17:21	Blingfried But my issue is w/ your tweet that 1 candidate wants universal health care &amp; the other doesn't want to "allow" folks to go to DR
EugeneMirman	703282469156622337	2016-02-26T18:16:21	Blingfried Sorry, I don't think it's inherently unrealistic. I am basing this off of what I've read about the feasibility of Bernie's plan.
EugeneMirman	703280631480868864	2016-02-26T18:09:03	Blingfried Okay, so what you mean is Hillary does not have a current specific plan. I don't think a specific, unrealistic plan is better.

EugeneMirman	703271930565160960	2016-02-26T17:34:29	Blingfried I think you're saying that if someone does not advocate single-payer health care they are not for universal health care?
EugeneMirman	703251271835369476	2016-02-26T16:12:23	Blingfried I'm not sure what you mean. She clearly supports health care for everyone, but maybe you mean a specific type of plan?
EugeneMirman	703245714806198272	2016-02-26T15:50:18	.realDonaldTrump Will you make spelling great again too?
EugeneMirman	703249417768402945	2016-02-26T16:05:01	Blingfried Meaning you believe Hillary does not support universal health care? Or Bernie?
EugeneMirman	703249198377005056	2016-02-26T16:04:09	Blingfried I don't fear higher taxes and I am not voting based on "identity politics." I just have different, but similar, criteria as you.
EugeneMirman	703248412704161793	2016-02-26T16:01:01	@LeadenLeviathan Yes, I agree with what you're saying. For me that person is Hillary, not Bernie. But Bernie if it's him or GOP.
EugeneMirman	703247156782698498	2016-02-26T15:56:02	Tscottrock88 Thanks!
EugeneMirman	703247043268050944	2016-02-26T15:55:35	Blingfried Which candidate thinks people shouldn't be "allowed" to go to the doctor?
EugeneMirman	702909534046711808	2016-02-25T17:34:27	@kj_comer You genuinely believe that she has no interest in people &amp; policies &amp; has spent 40 years doing it for "political gain"?
EugeneMirman	702908155399950337	2016-02-25T17:28:58	JoeyIannitelli So I find people arguing over these nuances condescendingly, depressing and flawed.
EugeneMirman	702908064245141505	2016-02-25T17:28:36	JoeyIannitelli I just think everyone knows that Bernie is more liberal and Hillary more moderate, but still pretty progressive.

EugeneMirman	702906781203353600	2016-02-25T17:23:30	ArcturusFats Not at all. What's weird is many of the arguments being made, not that they support Bernie.
EugeneMirman	702906488281538560	2016-02-25T17:22:20	I can't think of anything worse than a president who could change their mind and doesn't see everything through one ideological lens.
EugeneMirman	702905907324329984	2016-02-25T17:20:02	Wow. I didn't know Bernie Sanders was a candidate. Sorry I used Ted Cruz as an example of the very most important issue: consistency.
EugeneMirman	702905452707880962	2016-02-25T17:18:13	@PittsBern You'll find very few people from Russia who support the far-ish left. But I like Hillary &amp; think Bernie is MUCH better than GOP.
EugeneMirman	702904355226329088	2016-02-25T17:13:52	JoeyIannitelli Well, I was making the point that ideological consistency on it's own isn't inherently virtuous or beneficial.
EugeneMirman	702903104975577089	2016-02-25T17:08:54	@PittsBern Yes, he has been saying the same thing for 50 years. So if that is what is most important to you, you should vote for him.
