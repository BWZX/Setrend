harrynwilson	723487252425379840	2016-04-22T12:22:57	My guess is that the HSBC shares being voted in the auditorium today are moving the dial by 0.01pc at best.

harrynwilson	723481860072955904	2016-04-22T12:01:31	HSBC took £380m out of the bank's bonus pool because of fines and penalties says Sam Laidlaw, chairman of the remco.

harrynwilson	723473511780634624	2016-04-22T11:28:21	Flint says 6m HSBC customer transactions were processed through Post Offices last year. 99pc of HSBC branches within 1 mile of a PO.
harrynwilson	723473183370805249	2016-04-22T11:27:03	"The way ppl are doing business is through the branch in their pocket," says Flint asked about community banking.
harrynwilson	723472301463863296	2016-04-22T11:23:32	"We believe Britain is better at the heart of a reformed EU," says Flint.
harrynwilson	723471314820976640	2016-04-22T11:19:37	"You'll not be surprised that I don't agree with much of that..." says Flint in answer to 5min polemic from HSBC AGM regular Mr Mason Mahon.
harrynwilson	723469825411047424	2016-04-22T11:13:42	Flint: "Birmingham was the historic heart of our UK business...the migration of activity out to the SE to B and Manchester is a good thing."
harrynwilson	723468639299624960	2016-04-22T11:08:59	"We believe we are doing everything we can conceivably do to avoid that consequence [loss of US banking licence]," says Flint.
harrynwilson	723464285062451201	2016-04-22T10:51:41	Flint: "Your group is poised to be one of the biggest winners from a rise in interest rates... The low rates today are to bail out others."
harrynwilson	723463377805303808	2016-04-22T10:48:05	"The current cost of doing this review [domicile] was a few tens of millions of dollars," says Flint in answer to first Q from the floor.
harrynwilson	723462508967768064	2016-04-22T10:44:38	"If you have any specific Qs pls direct to one of our directors outside," says Flint. Good luck with that, suppose it has got to be said.
harrynwilson	723462023342862336	2016-04-22T10:42:42	Right Q&amp;A about to begin. Always the dullest part of an HSBC AGM...
harrynwilson	723460287265968128	2016-04-22T10:35:48	"We have decided to retain and restructure our Turkish operations," says Gulliver.
harrynwilson	723459591179243520	2016-04-22T10:33:02	"We have materially reshaped HSBC," says Gulliver. However, he says the biz environment is not what the bank had expected.
harrynwilson	723459153977552897	2016-04-22T10:31:18	Stuart Gulliver up now. "The share price is not where we want it to be." No messing about from the HSBC chief exec.
harrynwilson	723458845499101185	2016-04-22T10:30:04	Search process has commenced, says Flint talking about the work on looking for the bank's new chairman. Says decision will be made in 2017.
harrynwilson	723458464941522944	2016-04-22T10:28:33	And now pay. Lots of mumbles from HSBC shareholders. Flint outlining new compensation plan.
harrynwilson	723458112993255425	2016-04-22T10:27:09	Another mention by Flint of throwing out "bad actors". Will Razzie nominees become unbankable at HSBC? Could other banks follow their lead?
harrynwilson	723457230536871937	2016-04-22T10:23:39	Flint repeats that HSBC would restructure its IB in event of Brexit and would move jobs from London to Paris.
harrynwilson	723456875249995776	2016-04-22T10:22:14	"We believe the UK economy would enter a period of great uncertainty should the UK vote to leave the EU, says Flint.
harrynwilson	723456649743196161	2016-04-22T10:21:21	"Our own economic research is very clear that remaining in the EU is in our best interests," says Flint.
harrynwilson	723456376031219712	2016-04-22T10:20:15	Very long section in Flint speech on financial crime. Been talking about it for a couple of minutes now. Lot's of talk of "bad actors".
harrynwilson	723456065346658304	2016-04-22T10:19:01	"The so-called Panama papers have shown how perfectly legal corporate structures can be abused," says Flint.
harrynwilson	723455629298405376	2016-04-22T10:17:17	"We have no desire to do business with criminals anywhere in any currency," says Flint. Cue mocking laugh to my left.
harrynwilson	723455344060583936	2016-04-22T10:16:09	"It was an immense amount of work and I'm glad it is behind us," Douglas Flint about HSBC domicile review.
harrynwilson	723451446172094464	2016-04-22T10:00:40	Right, am seated at the HSBC AGM. Haven't done one of these in awhile. Like riding a bike, I guess.
