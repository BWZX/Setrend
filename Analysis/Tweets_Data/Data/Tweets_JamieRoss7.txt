JamieRoss7	725999062743416832	2016-04-29T10:43:59	I am not on board with Ian Murray's logic here. No one is suggesting he buys 74 more teaspoons. I own five, which I find to be enough.

JamieRoss7	725637397455753217	2016-04-28T10:46:51	I asked Sheridan if Robert the Bruce would have given his second vote to Solidarity. He says Bruce was "tactically astute" so may have done.
JamieRoss7	725635612347383808	2016-04-28T10:39:46	Tommy Sheridan says the SNP has not opposed austerity in the past twelve months, as promised in its general election manifesto.
JamieRoss7	725633560007290880	2016-04-28T10:31:36	Sheridan wants to convene "a council of war" with various authorities in Scotland. The war is against Tory austerity, he says.
JamieRoss7	725632488148705280	2016-04-28T10:27:21	"WE WANT TO BREAK WESTMINSTER," bellows Sheridan. Not calling it Westmonster marks a new conciliatory tone in his arguments.
JamieRoss7	725632064066822144	2016-04-28T10:25:40	He adds that this referendum will be won with "between 60 and 65%" of the vote.
JamieRoss7	725631834009296897	2016-04-28T10:24:45	Sheridan says his first act in the Scottish Parliament will be introduce an indyref2 bill. It would be held "before 2018".
JamieRoss7	725631037896794114	2016-04-28T10:21:35	Sheridan says people should vote Solidarity in order to "minimise the number of unionists elected".
JamieRoss7	725630842417065984	2016-04-28T10:20:49	"The SNP will romp this election," says Sheridan. "THEY WILL ROMP THIS ELECTION," he  repeats but a bit louder.
JamieRoss7	725630178060324865	2016-04-28T10:18:10	Sheridan says he hopes the press have enjoyed this launch more than the "humdrum" events from other parties. He need not worry.
JamieRoss7	725628576419160064	2016-04-28T10:11:48	This one is called Independence Day. I have heard this song live about a dozen times. Sheridan loving it.

JamieRoss7	725624285969133568	2016-04-28T09:54:45	I see Solidarity wants Scotland to become independent on 700th anniversary of the Declaration of Arbroath.

JamieRoss7	722857055904743424	2016-04-20T18:38:46	Nicola Sturgeon v GARYTANK is as excellent as it sounds, but absolutely cannot wait for Coburn's one. 
JamieRoss7	722807381743247360	2016-04-20T15:21:23	CaroleMagoha Sorry if it's too complicated for you.
JamieRoss7	722806303932997632	2016-04-20T15:17:06	CaroleMagoha It was opinion change &gt; manifesto commitment &gt; election &gt; referendum, now it's opinion change &gt; referendum.
JamieRoss7	722802969025126404	2016-04-20T15:03:51	Mentions of "austerity" in SNP manifestos: 2016 v 2015. 
JamieRoss7	722800749768544256	2016-04-20T14:55:02	DavidDhenry There's a stage missing. It was opinion change &gt; manifesto &gt; election &gt; referendum, now it's opinion change &gt; referendum.
JamieRoss7	722797983662809088	2016-04-20T14:44:02	Interesting that Sturgeon's thoughts on an indyref2 mandate have changed since last April.

JamieRoss7	722775936781914113	2016-04-20T13:16:26	The two most-photographed SNP politicians in the manifesto:  - Nicola Sturgeon with 31 photos - Mhairi Black with 3 photos

JamieRoss7	722754258165174272	2016-04-20T11:50:17	I've just noticed the "Scottish Production Fund" in the SNP manifesto which would take resources away from the BBC.

JamieRoss7	722744346315984896	2016-04-20T11:10:54	Alan Roden of the Scottish Daily Mail is roundly hissed as he takes the mic.
JamieRoss7	722743628230209537	2016-04-20T11:08:03	Sturgeon says Cameron's government is "the weakest in a long time" and SNP will challenge them. Someone shouts "yee ha!" in the audience.

JamieRoss7	722741070086475777	2016-04-20T10:57:53	As is tradition, Sturgeon begins the q&amp;a by urging the delegates to respect the media.
JamieRoss7	722740861356883968	2016-04-20T10:57:03	Here's Nicola Sturgeon surrounded by 1,400 holding up a photograph of her face. 
JamieRoss7	722740100929601536	2016-04-20T10:54:02	Sturgeon went off script and added a "when we do succeed" to this passage. 
JamieRoss7	722739618563690498	2016-04-20T10:52:07	Sturgeon on whether there will be an indyref2 in the next parliament - "I would like that very much".

JamieRoss7	722731368258617345	2016-04-20T10:19:20	"It's 72 pages," boasts Stewart Hosie of the manifesto.
JamieRoss7	722730689850916864	2016-04-20T10:16:38	This is the manifesto section on indyref2. Nothing particularly new in there. 
JamieRoss7	722729731884523520	2016-04-20T10:12:50	"This is the largest manifesto launch Scotland has ever seen," says John Swinney. Huge, if true. 
JamieRoss7	722729209756524544	2016-04-20T10:10:45	The pre-speech video is largely scenes from the Orkney and Shetland trip. It's triggering some horrible ferry flashbacks for me.
JamieRoss7	722728830704574464	2016-04-20T10:09:15	They've turned the lights to purple. Expecting The Undertaker to come out any second. 
JamieRoss7	722728376746827776	2016-04-20T10:07:27	Here's the manifesto front cover. The eagle-eyed among you will spot Nicola Sturgeon on it. 
JamieRoss7	722726399694516225	2016-04-20T09:59:35	Here's what Nicola Sturgeon will say about independence. 
JamieRoss7	722724765002285056	2016-04-20T09:53:06	The SNP manifesto launch venue is set up like a WWE arena. Finally Sturgeon is back in Edinburgh. 
JamieRoss7	722723002610237441	2016-04-20T09:46:06	The cheeky old SNP have made every member of the media wear one of these to get in. 
JamieRoss7	722704294793867264	2016-04-20T08:31:45	UKIP Scotland has sent me no less than 5 emails in the past 24 hours about Farage's trip to Inverness. Zero chill. 
JamieRoss7	722504025908854788	2016-04-19T19:15:57	Fresh evidence in the search for Kezia Dugdale's tv quiz appearances.

JamieRoss7	722464013024669696	2016-04-19T16:36:58	It turns out episodes of late-90s Scottish quiz shows aren't readily available on YouTube. I'm going to have to head into the archives.
JamieRoss7	722459673304174592	2016-04-19T16:19:43	Challenge accepted, kezdugdale. 
JamieRoss7	722400836832346113	2016-04-19T12:25:55	A Scottish Tory press release has just accidentally, I think, called Kezia Dugdale 'Dungdale'. SP16 
JamieRoss7	722427297949683712	2016-04-19T14:11:04	Incredible scenes. Pro-independence party RISE got the date of the referendum wrong in its manifesto. 
JamieRoss7	722409752584695808	2016-04-19T13:01:21	JimJamGin vengeance shall be mine
JamieRoss7	722376256570978304	2016-04-19T10:48:15	RISE say "fair enough" there is a mistake in manifesto about the 40p rate but doesn't impact on policy. SP16 
JamieRoss7	722376184034684928	2016-04-19T10:47:58	The figures in the manifesto are questioned by the BBC. Shafi says RISE is not in the business of "quibbling over a percent here or there".
JamieRoss7	722374737209507842	2016-04-19T10:42:13	Co-founder Jonathan Shafi concedes that RISE are "not gearing up for government".
JamieRoss7	722373694060961793	2016-04-19T10:38:04	RISE say universal free public transport would be "to the advantage rather than to the detriment" of the economy. 
JamieRoss7	722371122805805056	2016-04-19T10:27:51	RISE say changing income tax from 45p to 60p for high earners is a 15% increase. It's a 33% increase, isn't it? 
JamieRoss7	722369502265155584	2016-04-19T10:21:24	Colin Fox says the SNP "talk left but act right" and says many of their activists are increasingly unhappy about their policies.
JamieRoss7	722369100626980864	2016-04-19T10:19:49	Colin Fox says the promises in "Labour's famous vow" were not delivered.
JamieRoss7	722367983604129794	2016-04-19T10:15:22	Colin Fox says Sturgeon's "mibbes aye, mibbes naw" approach to indyref2 isn't good enough.
JamieRoss7	722366086189084673	2016-04-19T10:07:50	RISE also want free public transport for everyone, a maximum of two terms for all politicians, and a referendum before the next election.
JamieRoss7	722365599930839040	2016-04-19T10:05:54	At the RISE manifesto launch. They seem to be advocating a pay cap of £100k, and a 60p rate on salaries over £150k.

JamieRoss7	722323995438268417	2016-04-19T07:20:35	ICYMI: last night I was thrilled by a man saying "shitehole" in front of Nicola Sturgeon.  
JamieRoss7	722155897171087362	2016-04-18T20:12:37	Having drinks with a friend at Bon Vivant in Edinburgh &amp; chaps at the adjoining table left this friendly note for us

JamieRoss7	722155384421617664	2016-04-18T20:10:35	The man who called Sturgeon's constituency a shitehole to her face invites me to walk down the high street alone at midnight. I decline.
JamieRoss7	722152134855278592	2016-04-18T19:57:40	Coming here was worth it just to hear a man say "shitehole" in front of Nicola Sturgeon.
JamieRoss7	722151224531951616	2016-04-18T19:54:03	JamieRoss7 I'm quite surprised it hasn't came up during the debate so far.
JamieRoss7	722151685393674242	2016-04-18T19:55:53	"I'm not going to reduce this to Yes or No," says Sturgeon. "Why's the place a shitehole then?" responds the man.
JamieRoss7	722151304546664448	2016-04-18T19:54:22	He is not pleased that Zara Kitson did not provide a yes or no answer. 
JamieRoss7	722150806779248640	2016-04-18T19:52:23	"I'm not asking for a political answer, I'm looking for a yes or a no," heckles the man.

JamieRoss7	722149878600765440	2016-04-18T19:48:42	Sheridan attacks "mad Tories" who want to cut benefits. He also offers some leftfield criticism of hit-maker Gary Barlow.

JamieRoss7	722149133335805952	2016-04-18T19:45:44	Bold. Tory candidate Graham Hutchison says he completely disagrees with the way the UK government has treated disabled people.
JamieRoss7	722147325670465536	2016-04-18T19:38:33	The Labour candidate is booed for saying there should be no indyref2 and that the Scottish Parliament should use the powers it has.
JamieRoss7	722146876783529984	2016-04-18T19:36:46	The Tory is loudly booed for opposing a second referendum. This audience has been here for two hours and is getting a bit restless.
JamieRoss7	722146072248913920	2016-04-18T19:33:35	"Being independent is the way to tackle austerity," says Sturgeon. "I want to see independence as soon as possible."
JamieRoss7	722145622573334528	2016-04-18T19:31:47	Unsurprisingly half the audience wildly applaud Sheridan for saying he backs indyref2. Clerkin claps with particular enthusiasm.
JamieRoss7	722145413998997505	2016-04-18T19:30:58	The incredibly nervous Lib Dem is booed for opposing indyref2 and looks crestfallen.
JamieRoss7	722145106212581376	2016-04-18T19:29:44	The chair starts to ask questions from people online. Perhaps fairly the people who actually bothered to come along are slightly annoyed.

JamieRoss7	722140973980106752	2016-04-18T19:13:19	The Green candidate Zara Kitson wrongly claims that mudslinging between politicians is boring.
JamieRoss7	722140376220479490	2016-04-18T19:10:57	A woman heckles the candidates saying "we're not interested in he rest of Scotland, we just care about Govanhill.".
JamieRoss7	722139318404399104	2016-04-18T19:06:44	The candidates are asked what they'd change from the past 5 years. Sheridan said he'd do more to counter media lies during the indyref.
JamieRoss7	722137629655986176	2016-04-18T19:00:02	The Labour candidate says she's not aiming to be first minister. A group in the corner burst out laughing and say "you'd be lucky".

JamieRoss7	722135412785987585	2016-04-18T18:51:13	A rare cross-party agreement between Tommy Sheridan and the Conservatives who both want to see the offensive behaviour act scrapped.
JamieRoss7	722134481667284993	2016-04-18T18:47:31	Sturgeon is asked specifically if the offensive behaviour act should be reviewed. She says all legislation should be kept under review.
JamieRoss7	722131545021145092	2016-04-18T18:35:51	After I recorded that sly vine of Sheridan the sound of it started blaring out of my phone. Terrifying moment.
JamieRoss7	722131239025696769	2016-04-18T18:34:38	Clerkin got the first question. I held my breath. He asked a sensible question about housing. What is going on? 
JamieRoss7	722130611348103170	2016-04-18T18:32:08	Sheridan isn't speaking into the mic but is one thousand times louder than any of the other panellists. 
JamieRoss7	722130327951552512	2016-04-18T18:31:01	Tommy Sheridan says, within three months of being elected, he'd introduce a bill for a 2018 indyref2. Sturgeon doesn't react.
JamieRoss7	722129761540186112	2016-04-18T18:28:46	"The people of Glasgow southside deserve better than Nicola Sturgeon," he says to gasps in the crowd.
JamieRoss7	722129529309958145	2016-04-18T18:27:50	The bold young Tory candidate goes for Sturgeon in his opening statement. He calls the SNP "a failing government". She shakes her head.
JamieRoss7	722128158066089984	2016-04-18T18:22:24	Sturgeon's opening statement is purely local, focussing on this Govanhill constituency. Sean Clerkin looks on - watching, waiting.
JamieRoss7	722122938896490497	2016-04-18T18:01:39	Oh my word. I've just spotted Sean Clerkin of the Scottish Resistance in the crowd.
JamieRoss7	722121984138719234	2016-04-18T17:57:52	MhairiHunter Hello.
JamieRoss7	722121456579166208	2016-04-18T17:55:46	Sheridan and Sturgeon shared a brief bit of banter offstage before we got started. Didn't think that's a sight I would ever see.
JamieRoss7	722117589435072512	2016-04-18T17:40:24	Tommy Sheridan is arguably too keen for this. 
JamieRoss7	722112485126447105	2016-04-18T17:20:07	I'm in a Glasgow high school awaiting a box office hustings involving both Sturgeon &amp; Sheridan. Also apparently Fran from Travis went here.

JamieRoss7	722023776762925057	2016-04-18T11:27:37	In tragic news a Unionist Camp sprang up in Holyrood over the weekend but they've already left before I could go to meet them.

JamieRoss7	720206648212635648	2016-04-13T11:07:00	The Resistance criticise Ruth Davidson for refusing to come to George Square to have a debate with them about cuts.
JamieRoss7	720206152529788930	2016-04-13T11:05:02	Not a massive crowd, let's be honest. 
JamieRoss7	720205675322818560	2016-04-13T11:03:08	There is conflict in the Resistance because they're two minutes late. "We need to organise ourselves properly," says an angry member.

JamieRoss7	720203387803975680	2016-04-13T10:54:03	After boldly announcing they were going to burn the Tory manifesto in George Sq, the Resistance ask for my copy. I politely decline.
JamieRoss7	720200193044582400	2016-04-13T10:41:21	The Resistance say they're going to George Sq to tear up manifestos. I ask if that's not littering. "We'll pick it up after, they say.

JamieRoss7	720194642239700992	2016-04-13T10:19:17	Ruth Davidson quizzed on her new pro-union drive. "Project fear is over," she says. "We want a considered conversation."
JamieRoss7	720194408193355776	2016-04-13T10:18:22	A short but powerful speech from Davidson there. Easy message: no indyref2 and Labour is rubbish.
JamieRoss7	720193417158987776	2016-04-13T10:14:25	"The Labour Party had had nine years, six leaders, and no success in holding the SNP to account," says Davidson.
JamieRoss7	720192407296483328	2016-04-13T10:10:25	"The case for independence is dead," says Davidson. "The case for the Union must now be made."
JamieRoss7	720192134087909376	2016-04-13T10:09:19	"Too often over recent years, our case for the Union has simply been a matter of picking at the flaws of independence," concedes Davidson.
JamieRoss7	720191915044573184	2016-04-13T10:08:27	"We do not believe there are ANY so-called indyref triggers" says Davidson. "Including any hypothetical scenario from June's EU referendum."
JamieRoss7	720191462722420737	2016-04-13T10:06:39	Davidson says Labour is on course for its "worst ever Holyrood result". "I seek to lead a strong opposition to the SNP," she says.
JamieRoss7	720191232404811776	2016-04-13T10:05:44	"I would love to be first minister on May 6th," says Davidson, conceding it's unlikely. "Folk aren't daft." 
JamieRoss7	720188372719964160	2016-04-13T09:54:23	The Tories are going to make a "fresh drive" to strengthen the Union.

JamieRoss7	718135844264087553	2016-04-07T17:58:22	The security took this morning UKIP's manifesto out of my bag and asked why it said "I'm not voting UKIP" on it. It said "I'm voting UKIP".
JamieRoss7	718134778629857280	2016-04-07T17:54:08	jordandaly_ Oh?
JamieRoss7	718134739425689601	2016-04-07T17:53:58	Seven minutes to go... 
JamieRoss7	718133567415533568	2016-04-07T17:49:19	The security here are very jittery. Wooden screens have been put up at the doors now to prevent the protesters from storming in.
JamieRoss7	718133256743469056	2016-04-07T17:48:05	I spoke to them. I'm back in. I win.
JamieRoss7	718131935608979456	2016-04-07T17:42:50	There are about 20 protesters here. The organisers told me if I talk to them I won't be allowed back in. 
JamieRoss7	718125943009775616	2016-04-07T17:19:01	I think Grassroots out may have slightly overestimated how many seats they're going to need here. 
JamieRoss7	718099101007609856	2016-04-07T15:32:21	I'm now back in the UKIPmobile heading for Glasgow. I've had no food or water since 8am. Tremendous day out.
JamieRoss7	718090069354086401	2016-04-07T14:56:28	It's very loud in here so I have no idea what they're saying. I think it's mainly in praise of carpets though.
JamieRoss7	718089811123376128	2016-04-07T14:55:27	Just a bunch of ordinary guys enjoying watching some carpet being shredded. 
JamieRoss7	718087976723619840	2016-04-07T14:48:09	Just a bunch of ordinary guys chatting about carpets. 
JamieRoss7	718087521264148481	2016-04-07T14:46:21	Coburn has important business to distract him from the carpet-making. 
JamieRoss7	718086646957228032	2016-04-07T14:42:52	Here we are at a "carpet/tile factory" in borders. I don't think I've ever seen Coburn do a proper photo op before. 
JamieRoss7	718085582686195713	2016-04-07T14:38:38	One of the UKIP candidates in the car is feeling exceptionally carsick. We're at least 40 minutes late. Disaster.
JamieRoss7	718084430527668230	2016-04-07T14:34:04	We are v much lost in the borders. Coburn just rang this car in a panic because he's arrived at the venue and doesn't know who to speak to.
JamieRoss7	718072582910689280	2016-04-07T13:46:59	UKIP Scotland Just Held The Most Bizarre Manifesto Launch Of The Year   
JamieRoss7	718062865400401920	2016-04-07T13:08:22	Uh oh – I'm hearing that there might be an anti-UKIP protest gathering at the next scheduled stop in the borders.
JamieRoss7	718047474649341953	2016-04-07T12:07:13	I'm now in the back of a Land Rover with two UKIP Scotland candidates on the way to a PFL with Farage. This is my best day.
JamieRoss7	718042178069598208	2016-04-07T11:46:10	A number of people in UKIP Scotland didn't know it was paid parking here and have been fined during the manifesto launch.
JamieRoss7	718039990907899905	2016-04-07T11:37:29	"Say BREXIT after three," bellows Coburn. "Right, who's buying the drinks?" 
JamieRoss7	718036675692273664	2016-04-07T11:24:18	Ah, shame, Farage tells me he doesn't think Galloway is coming along to the event in Glasgow tonight.
JamieRoss7	718027620840054785	2016-04-07T10:48:19	I asked UKIP's press guy if Coburn is around for interview. "When he's back I'll bring him up and you guys can rip him to pieces," he says.
JamieRoss7	718024834865827840	2016-04-07T10:37:15	That's the UKIP Scotland manifesto launch over but, never fear, I will be following Farage and Coburn around Scotland for the next 10 hours.
JamieRoss7	718018460928880640	2016-04-07T10:11:55	Farage is asked whether it's still UKIP policy to cut Scotland's block grant from WM. "We've got to look at it," he says.
JamieRoss7	718016630010351616	2016-04-07T10:04:39	Farage says there's an "interesting segment" within SNP vote who he believes will vote for leaving the EU.
JamieRoss7	718016256465584128	2016-04-07T10:03:10	"We're the only party arguing for more powers for the Scottish Parliament," says Farage. But in the manifesto: 
JamieRoss7	718015463364698114	2016-04-07T10:00:01	"I shall miss David in Brussels very much," says Farage, predicting a romping victory for Coburn in May.
JamieRoss7	718014536016592896	2016-04-07T09:56:20	"I was pleased to see there wasn't usual welcome committee," says Farage. "Perhaps the debate in Scotland has moved to a more mature level."
JamieRoss7	718014147762503681	2016-04-07T09:54:47	"That's UKIP's message and I hope you'll all vote for us," concludes Coburn.
JamieRoss7	718013952920305664	2016-04-07T09:54:01	"Every one of them wants to pluck the voter," says Coburn on his opponents. "We want to make sure voters and not plucked."
JamieRoss7	718013771084664832	2016-04-07T09:53:17	"If you go to the doors and ask if they're voting UKIP they look up, down, left, right, and say 'yes but don't tell anyone'," says Coburn.
JamieRoss7	718012620784214016	2016-04-07T09:48:43	"This is the county of Dr Livingstone," rants Coburn. "We want to train our own doctors and nurses."
JamieRoss7	718012011909660672	2016-04-07T09:46:18	Coburn's microphone isn't even on. 
JamieRoss7	718011493292367872	2016-04-07T09:44:14	"People should not have to pay for the privilege of living in Scotland," says Coburn.
JamieRoss7	718011261766729728	2016-04-07T09:43:19	Coburn's speech begins. He's absolutely furious about his bins not being collected. "We don't want the place to turn into Cairo," he says.
JamieRoss7	718010156093714432	2016-04-07T09:38:55	I see UKIP want to increase the drink driving limit and return smoking to pubs. 
JamieRoss7	718009136198389760	2016-04-07T09:34:52	Candidate Kevin Newton describes the manifesto as "the most detailed in our history". A huge claim.
JamieRoss7	718008548739952641	2016-04-07T09:32:32	Coburn introduces Farage by describing him as "one of the greatest speakers of our time".
JamieRoss7	718008440090726400	2016-04-07T09:32:06	Coburn starts off winning friends in the room by slamming the BBC and STV for not inviting him to the TV debates.
JamieRoss7	718008149614190592	2016-04-07T09:30:57	Yaaaaaaas. Here we go! 
JamieRoss7	718007200401256448	2016-04-07T09:27:11	The event isn't even due to start until half past and it's already been one of the highlights of the political year.
JamieRoss7	718006379638861825	2016-04-07T09:23:55	The accordion player tells me he doesn't support UKIP. "I'm pretty impartial, I just like playing the accordion," he says.
JamieRoss7	718005205040758784	2016-04-07T09:19:15	There are scintillating rumours sweeping the manifesto launch that Galloway will be a surprise guest at tonight's Grassroots Out event.
JamieRoss7	718002804447645696	2016-04-07T09:09:43	I'm told the accordionist is award-winning - "one of the best accordionist in the highlands," boasts UKIP candidate Casumptious.

JamieRoss7	717476462643830785	2016-04-05T22:18:13	Coburn just used the term "milk cow" in place of the more traditional "cash cow". All cows are milk cows, David.

JamieRoss7	715193237309362176	2016-03-30T15:05:30	There were rumours Coburn tried to gatecrash last night. He insists he was going for a Chinese on the same street.

JamieRoss7	714918610121187328	2016-03-29T20:54:13	Just to remind you, two hours on, David Coburn is still Periscoping. "STV are against democracy in Scotland," he says again.

JamieRoss7	714893992077471745	2016-03-29T19:16:24	I have messaged Coburn asking what happened to his Periscope. I have also missed the first 15 minutes of the debate gutting myself at that.
JamieRoss7	714893381592346628	2016-03-29T19:13:58	This is absolutely fantastic. Eight minutes of Coburn just staring at the camera trying to figure out what to do. 
JamieRoss7	714892925881159681	2016-03-29T19:12:10	Amazing. It seems Coburn couldn't work out how to get the sound working for his Periscope.

JamieRoss7	707661276898586625	2016-03-09T20:16:10	"If capitalism was a dish then murder would be its flavour," she says a few minutes into the poem.
JamieRoss7	707660612415918080	2016-03-09T20:13:32	There is now a poet reciting "a battle cry for Jeremy Corbyn".

JamieRoss7	707653960845430788	2016-03-09T19:47:06	Jeremy Hardy jokes that people who support Trident renewal probably suffer from depression.

JamieRoss7	707648185083232256	2016-03-09T19:24:09	It's filling up a bit now, to be fair. I'll take a photo at half past to wait for the stragglers from the bar.

JamieRoss7	707646535492902912	2016-03-09T19:17:36	In about one hour it seems I will be enjoying a Charlotte Church set with around 30 other people.
JamieRoss7	707645748163289088	2016-03-09T19:14:28	Admittedly this Corbyn 4 PM in Edinburgh doesn't start until half past, but the signs aren't good.
