kevinroose	717906980908576768	2016-04-07T02:48:56	jwherrman Depends on the terms. But I would accept a zero-interest loan from a lot of places!
kevinroose	717906672635609088	2016-04-07T02:47:43	jwherrman sure, but those people would be "beholden" to Clearbanc as the lender, not Uber. Uber is just the quasi-guarantor.
kevinroose	717905285210189824	2016-04-07T02:42:12	jwherrman Totally. But almost any short-term liquidity provider with 0% APR is better than the stuff that preys on poor people now.
kevinroose	717904621788762113	2016-04-07T02:39:34	jwherrman but it says they can repay Clearbanc directly if e.g. they get the money from another job.
