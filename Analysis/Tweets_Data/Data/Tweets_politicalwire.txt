politicalwire	710116482781470720	2016-03-16T14:52:17	Despite this, I can’t see Republicans reversing themselves. And if Hillary wins, they will pay dearly   
politicalwire	710108389469245440	2016-03-16T14:20:07	The number of people who are still saying they think Trump will tone down his rhetoric is sort of startling
politicalwire	710111292317683712	2016-03-16T14:31:39	Can Obama revoke the nomination himself if Clinton wins?  
politicalwire	710112560792662016	2016-03-16T14:36:42	I’m sure Trump will have something interesting top say about this…  
politicalwire	710112105740038145	2016-03-16T14:34:53	This is probably Garland’s only shot. If Clinton wins in November, there’s no way she choose him over a liberal  
politicalwire	710111812893724672	2016-03-16T14:33:44	It’s not a bad political move at all to name a centrist and then have the GOP try to block him 
politicalwire	710111581665886208	2016-03-16T14:32:48	The best thing about Obama’s pick of Merrick Garland has to be his name

politicalwire	710108346465001472	2016-03-16T14:19:57	The GOP really has no reason not to consider this pick  
politicalwire	710108081317924869	2016-03-16T14:18:54	Obama apparently knows politics better than Hatch and drives a big wedge between the GOP senate

politicalwire	710071410081800193	2016-03-16T11:53:11	Trump on who he's consulting with on foreign policy: "I'm speaking with myself because I have a very good brain."
politicalwire	710070089094209536	2016-03-16T11:47:56	Kasich winning Ohio might have guaranteed Trump the nomination ($)  
politicalwire	710069187956318208	2016-03-16T11:44:21	It seems ludicrous that if realDonaldTrump amasses nearly the # he needs, the GOP would hand nomination to someone who didn't even run.

politicalwire	709905398082506752	2016-03-16T00:53:30	There aren’t enough delegates left for Kasich to win. He’s all about denying Trump now and emerging in Cleveland.

politicalwire	709900747375304704	2016-03-16T00:35:02	So Jeb never came out an endorsed anyone…
politicalwire	709900148005015552	2016-03-16T00:32:39	Concession speeches always reveal honest assessments of the electorate that make you wonder why the candidate didn't acknowledge it sooner
politicalwire	709900078945853440	2016-03-16T00:32:22	It seems very plausible a conservative third party will emerge if Trump is nominee. But also seems less likely Trump can get 1,237

politicalwire	709897644609560577	2016-03-16T00:22:42	Is Rubio conceding, withdrawing, suspending..or announcing?
politicalwire	709897654420054016	2016-03-16T00:22:44	Do you think Donald Trump will be able to resist kicking Marco Rubio when he’s just been humiliated like this?
politicalwire	709897251145945088	2016-03-16T00:21:08	"This year, we will not be on the winning side." Yes, this year, says Rubio.
politicalwire	709896971096424448	2016-03-16T00:20:01	As you watch this speech, remember that Marco Rubio said Barack Obama is intentionally trying to damage America.
politicalwire	709896718247194624	2016-03-16T00:19:01	Maybe Rubio will win the nomination of the next party to emerge from the ashes of the GOP
politicalwire	709896359911038976	2016-03-16T00:17:36	Rubio is done

politicalwire	708142786206375936	2016-03-11T04:09:31	I’ll bet the ratings of this debate tonight were fairly low
politicalwire	708142701435338752	2016-03-11T04:09:11	My reaction to tonight’s debate 
politicalwire	708142202074099712	2016-03-11T04:07:12	Trump suggests no more debates…
politicalwire	708141660438405120	2016-03-11T04:05:03	Kasich was solid but easily forgettable when the other candidates stay out of the mud pit.  
politicalwire	708141537163661313	2016-03-11T04:04:33	Donald Trump succeeded in trying to be “presidential” — if your idea of a president is George W. Bush. 
politicalwire	708141465654960128	2016-03-11T04:04:16	“Marco Rubio was the clear winner tonight and he got stronger as the debate went on.” 
politicalwire	708141380334456832	2016-03-11T04:03:56	“It might have been the best debate for all four candidates.” 
politicalwire	708141303146684416	2016-03-11T04:03:37	A classy debate
politicalwire	708141239116423168	2016-03-11T04:03:22	That took two minutes
politicalwire	708039855440318464	2016-03-10T21:20:30	The Trump campaign's sliming of MichelleFields is one of the most disgusting things I have ever seen from a politician and his hatchet men.
politicalwire	708141132543369216	2016-03-11T04:02:57	How long before CNN grabs Trump for a 10 minute interview?
politicalwire	708140860983136256	2016-03-11T04:01:52	My reaction to tonight’s Republican debate  
politicalwire	708137708749725696	2016-03-11T03:49:20	Actually they're not even trying to 
politicalwire	708137642945351680	2016-03-11T03:49:05	Imagine if Trump would just sit down with a few policy briefing books while flying around the country to his campaign rallies.
politicalwire	708136502006517760	2016-03-11T03:44:33	Rubio ought to make an explicit appeal for non-Trump voters to support him in FL as a way of stopping Trump.
politicalwire	708136983365881857	2016-03-11T03:46:28	What are the odds Rubio's wife actually told him that story on Tuesday night?
politicalwire	708127319467167744	2016-03-11T03:08:03	I'll say again tonight: Rubio's one debate screwup was the most pivotal moment of the campaign, and yet he's consistently the best debater.
politicalwire	708126183364411392	2016-03-11T03:03:33	Tangling with Trump hasn’t worked for anyone so far. Maybe not tangling with him will work?
politicalwire	708125877813510144	2016-03-11T03:02:20	Donald Trump may have less intellectual curiosity than even George W. Bush. Discuss.
politicalwire	708125544714469376	2016-03-11T03:01:00	I’ve watched about 23 hours of GOP debates so far (!) This has been the only hour I actually know where these guys stand on actual issues
politicalwire	708124930701987841	2016-03-11T02:58:34	If Trump was not self-funding, could he take that position on Israel and Palestine?
politicalwire	708124786661203968	2016-03-11T02:58:00	Trump knows Jews
politicalwire	708123562968748032	2016-03-11T02:53:08	Trump: Muslims are not friendly. Not let me explain how I'd kill innocent women and children.
politicalwire	708122889489408000	2016-03-11T02:50:27	You know it’s going to be hard for Trump not to call him Little Marco
politicalwire	708122575105236993	2016-03-11T02:49:12	Rubio just gave his best answer of any debate re: Muslims....but it's going to be of no help to him politically.
politicalwire	708122281055264770	2016-03-11T02:48:02	Trump stands by his comment that all Muslims hate us. JoeNBC was eloquent on this disgusting comment on Morning_Joe today GOPDebate
politicalwire	708120470156140544	2016-03-11T02:40:50	When this debate turns to trade, Trump wins
politicalwire	708120325855297536	2016-03-11T02:40:16	This has been Trump's best 40 minutes of any debate.
politicalwire	708119640979992576	2016-03-11T02:37:33	The only way for Rubio or Cruz to make inroads is to get under Trump’s skin. Not working!
politicalwire	708119091240894466	2016-03-11T02:35:22	Rubio and Cruz are falling into Trump’s trap… If this debate ended right now, he wins.
politicalwire	708118542802161664	2016-03-11T02:33:11	No attacks yet… Jeff Zucker is losing it in the control room
politicalwire	708117280194961408	2016-03-11T02:28:10	CNN is willing a fight to break out with a split screen of Rubio and Trump
politicalwire	708117029899743232	2016-03-11T02:27:10	Who has the stranger hair: Trump or Kasich?
politicalwire	708116331426660356	2016-03-11T02:24:24	Rubio is talking a lot of retirement because he’s likely done in 5 days
politicalwire	708116006095478785	2016-03-11T02:23:06	Somewhere Jeb Bush is watching this debate focused entirely on policy and wondering what might have been
politicalwire	708115121667751937	2016-03-11T02:19:35	If you have watched all 12 of the 2015-2016 GOP debates, you have spent more than a day of your life watching the 2015-2016 GOP debates.
politicalwire	708115072380440576	2016-03-11T02:19:24	If realDonaldTrump has already announced Carson endorsement how will CNN call it "BREAKING NEWS" and do a 30 min cutaway tomorrow???
politicalwire	708115044798599168	2016-03-11T02:19:17	Ben Carson endorsing Trump, wow. And Trump brags, of course: "so honored to be endorsed by the guy I called a child molester"
politicalwire	708114962825224192	2016-03-11T02:18:57	Big winner tonight: The audience isn’t hooting and hollering
politicalwire	708114631114543104	2016-03-11T02:17:38	It would be kind of funny if Carson didn’t endorse Trump tomorrow

politicalwire	708103990022529024	2016-03-11T01:35:21	How can a network that lies about what time a debate starts call out candidates for their lies during the actual debate?
