jamestaranto	694987024860909568	2016-02-03T20:53:13	Interesting how we are always calling on Muslims to be "moderate" but it is clearly a bad word in the US--GOP &amp; Dems

jamestaranto	694985714619043840	2016-02-03T20:48:01	Also not what I said. 
jamestaranto	694984820078813188	2016-02-03T20:44:27	Did not say he was anti-Christian, just that he sometimes comes across that way.

jamestaranto	694983371529838592	2016-02-03T20:38:42	I'm thinking bitter clingers and Crusades. I suppose one could argue the latter is better described as maladroit.

jamestaranto	694981833533059072	2016-02-03T20:32:35	The comment I highlighted is unobjectionable in itself. But if his purpose is to promote Muslim-Christian amity... 
jamestaranto	694974945043025920	2016-02-03T20:05:13	Waiting for an example re Christians. I think of "bitter clingers" and Crusades hectoring. 
jamestaranto	694974139476606980	2016-02-03T20:02:01	I don't know how one would begin to assign a probability to that proposition. 
jamestaranto	694967830933020673	2016-02-03T19:36:57	Which brings me back to my original point. Christians, Jews and atheists are all frequently demonized. 
jamestaranto	694967451788931073	2016-02-03T19:35:27	Bingo. That's why I sometimes call myself a lapsed atheist. 
jamestaranto	694966908563628032	2016-02-03T19:33:17	Maybe Trump saw the Dems benefitting from voter suppression cries and so he's trying to emulate?

jamestaranto	694965737769848832	2016-02-03T19:28:38	wrong word i think 
jamestaranto	694959622491340800	2016-02-03T19:04:20	I don't understand your point re atheists but accept the example re Jews. 
jamestaranto	694959223730499584	2016-02-03T19:02:45	But Obama was referring specifically to Muslim AMERICANS. 
jamestaranto	694955346184503296	2016-02-03T18:47:20	OK, so what about Jews, atheists, etc.? 
jamestaranto	694953771751882758	2016-02-03T18:41:05	I'm unsure. But the question is: If not, why not? 
jamestaranto	694951933656854528	2016-02-03T18:33:47	Has Obama ever said this about Christian Americans (or Jewish ones, or atheist ones, etc.)?

jamestaranto	694354686011428865	2016-02-02T03:00:32	Interesting: Cruz is from Houston, Trump is from New York, and Rubio is from Miami, three big metros with large immigrant populations.
