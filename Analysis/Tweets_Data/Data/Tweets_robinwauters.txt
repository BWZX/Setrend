robinwauters	712626917422329856	2016-03-23T13:07:51	simonmc I’m sure great founders are DYING to pay those people very well if it means they can help companies grow faster. Why wouldn’t they?
robinwauters	712626630632542209	2016-03-23T13:06:43	simonmc I think this may be partly anecdotal as well? ;)
robinwauters	712626473979486209	2016-03-23T13:06:06	simonmc what’s your biggest problem right now? “Finding talent, the kind that has scaled once or twice before.” almost always the reply
robinwauters	712626353812717568	2016-03-23T13:05:37	simonmc it’s one of my favourite questions whenever I talk to founders of fast-growing, found product-market fit type companies in the EU..
robinwauters	712626016414474240	2016-03-23T13:04:16	simonmc the way it should be, not there yet. claiming there’s no shortage of talent in Europe is equally false than claiming there is one.
robinwauters	712625608069656577	2016-03-23T13:02:39	The tech industry is booming &amp; here's a list of Europe's 50 top tech companies via tech_eu bcseducation RITTech 
robinwauters	712625610099662848	2016-03-23T13:02:40	simonmc growing up is not the same as scaling up, but that’s semantics. I mean building world-class firms with only EU talent? fat chance!
robinwauters	712625397863747584	2016-03-23T13:01:49	simonmc it’s a super simple demand-supply issue for me. more scale-ups in EU will bring more experience. but it doesn’t magically appear.
robinwauters	712625231433768961	2016-03-23T13:01:09	simonmc I just hear from the best companies a common refrain: yes you can hire people who’ve scaled companies to 100 people. but 1,000?
robinwauters	712625090266062848	2016-03-23T13:00:36	simonmc dunno, but surely you don’t either. anecdotally, yes, definitely increasing.
robinwauters	712624730629664768	2016-03-23T12:59:10	simonmc to illustrate many of the best companies in Europe are hiring vets from the United States now. you  think they don’t pay them well?

robinwauters	712624480263270400	2016-03-23T12:58:10	simonmc or, as my guess would be, it’s because the ecosystem is still in construction and many simply haven’t yet scaled up before
robinwauters	712624398453370880	2016-03-23T12:57:51	simonmc are you saying the reason we don’t have that much experienced talent in scaling because we don’t pay people enough?
