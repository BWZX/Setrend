alivitali	724353756264042496	2016-04-24T21:46:07	I think I've (almost) heard it all. Trump just said GrahamBlog is "really a nice guy" after attacking him for mooonths.
alivitali	724353105459052545	2016-04-24T21:43:32	"Everything in politics it‚Äôs all spin, its all crap." -Trump after just telling a story where he was hurrying off stage to spin post-debate.
alivitali	724352108552687616	2016-04-24T21:39:35	I'm now being corrected for taking Trump's words at their literal face value. As he just said here "you can't win!" 
alivitali	724351613800964096	2016-04-24T21:37:37	VileStyle not NBC! Those are the exact numbers I tweeted - and it's the only poll Trump referenced today.
alivitali	724351263308189698	2016-04-24T21:36:13	Trump remembers a protester sign that read "Trump = hate." "I equal love," he clarified.
alivitali	724350319220674560	2016-04-24T21:32:28	Trump *could have been in OH more. Florida wasn't in question - at least not from NBC/WSJ polls at that time.
alivitali	724349982199939073	2016-04-24T21:31:08	Just to be clear: I mention NBC polls b/c Trump's using them to rationalize losing in OH, which he says he'd have won if he was there more.
alivitali	724349762351280132	2016-04-24T21:30:15	Months after Jeb dropped out, Trump is *still mocking him for questioning if Trump is a conservative or not.
alivitali	724349203951063040	2016-04-24T21:28:02	Trump had pivoted to the impacts of outsourcing. Says the economic system is rigged, just like the delegate system
alivitali	724349290211061761	2016-04-24T21:28:23	So now 30 minutes in he's pivoted off the delegates, 1237, convention message he'd been hammering. Talking his standard jobs points now.
alivitali	724348540475068416	2016-04-24T21:25:24	So that doesnt explain his lack of time spent in OH. Meanwhile NBC SC poll had him down b4 primary. He made his displeasure known then (2/2)
alivitali	724347935668973569	2016-04-24T21:23:00	Earlier, Trump said a "dirty" NBC/WSJ poll in FL made him focus on FL instead of Ohio. Untrue. That poll had him up 43%-22% over Rubio (1/2)
alivitali	724347180413267968	2016-04-24T21:20:00	Trump has talked about delegates and the delegate process for the first 30 minutes of his speech today. That's way more than usual.

alivitali	724345759626334208	2016-04-24T21:14:21	Quintessential Trump - here on 1,237: "I think I'm gonna get there, so I'm not complaining about it, although I am."
alivitali	724345387142799361	2016-04-24T21:12:52	Minutes after accusing Cruz of bribing delegates, Trump predicts that 4-5 weeks from now Cruz "will be one of my best friends." Hm.
alivitali	724344009422962688	2016-04-24T21:07:24	Credit where credit is due on this one. That's not bad. 
alivitali	724343680878911488	2016-04-24T21:06:05	Interesting that Trump hypothesizes a scenario where he's "maybe" 25 delegates short. Seems an oddly specific number...

alivitali	708829915718651906	2016-03-13T01:39:55	Trump doesn't work the rope line tonight. He waves and Secret Service takes him off stage.

alivitali	708826387759521793	2016-03-13T01:25:54	So you can read what Trump just did here in Kansas City, his metaphor for taking refugees and terror: 
alivitali	708825811038523392	2016-03-13T01:23:37	Yuuuup. 
alivitali	708825641240530944	2016-03-13T01:22:56	"I hope these guys get thrown into a jail, they'll never do it again!" -Trump on protesters, promising he'll "start pressing charges."
alivitali	708825323786272772	2016-03-13T01:21:41	Oh man, are we about to get another reading of "The Snake"?
alivitali	708823900646301696	2016-03-13T01:16:01	We had a long stretch with no protesters at Trump's rally. As the latest group leaves, a guy shouts: "Waterboard 'em!"
alivitali	708823609515479042	2016-03-13T01:14:52	Just now at Trump rally in Kansas City. One of many happened in the last few minutes. 
alivitali	708820764733022208	2016-03-13T01:03:34	Trump says he's gonna start to "go strongly for arrest" of protesters b/c "once that starts happening" not gonna have anymore protesters.
alivitali	708817023648735232	2016-03-13T00:48:42	Trump continues to react with "get em out, get em out" and "go home to mommy." Then: "exciting though, right?"
alivitali	708816396033982464	2016-03-13T00:46:12	Rally is once again totally disrupted by multiple protesters. Trump supporters now trying to wrest it back by chanting "USA!"

alivitali	708802626553401344	2016-03-12T23:51:29	For me, the usual pre-Trump rally announcement about this being a "peaceful rally" has taken on new meaning after last night in Chicago.
alivitali	708801067966857217	2016-03-12T23:45:18	Unprompted, a Trump supporter took the signs of protesters in the lobby. After talking to cops, supporter kept the signs + ripped them up.
alivitali	708795771127144448	2016-03-12T23:24:15	Directly across the street from entrance, lots of protesters. Reminds me of Burlington on a smaller scale. 
alivitali	708731791209734145	2016-03-12T19:10:01	Trump says Chicago protests "just makes all of our friends and supporters more angry." He tells fans to vote Tues for "resounding victory."
alivitali	708731924676812800	2016-03-12T19:10:33	"Yesterday, in Chicago, we had a little bit of a problem," Donald Trump says, adding that the printed protest signs there didn't "look good"
alivitali	708732003013758977	2016-03-12T19:10:51	This, I believe, is Cruz's first event in Ohio. Asked yesterday if his supporters there should strategically vote for Kasich, Cruz said no.

alivitali	708696789537398784	2016-03-12T16:50:56	Best example yet of his tensions are higher than ever at these rallies. Have never seen Service have to get on stage during rally. Jarring.

alivitali	708369864533086208	2016-03-11T19:11:51	Yes, it is accurate for the Washington Post to report that there are racial tensions at Trump rallies. Trump himself acknowledges tension.

alivitali	701227917154635780	2016-02-21T02:12:18	Trump didn't mention Jeb tonight at all. Jeb was a man who was a constant part of Trump's stump speech for months. A permanent Trump foil.

alivitali	701225031431544832	2016-02-21T02:00:50	Trump's now moved on to different portions of his stump speech. Wall, repealing/replacing Obamacare, Mexico, 2nd amendment.

alivitali	687859069483380737	2016-01-15T04:49:16	Donald Trump says in post-debate interview with Fox Business he only sleeps about four hours per night. "I haven't needed it, genetically."
alivitali	687855190410719232	2016-01-15T04:33:51	Endorse. 
alivitali	687854114315829248	2016-01-15T04:29:35	I spy ChrisSnyderFox on the FBN post-debate show!
alivitali	687853585493848064	2016-01-15T04:27:29	That Jeb Trump handshake though.

alivitali	687844375473340416	2016-01-15T03:50:53	Sorry, again, Trump's answer on this (corporate inversion) is his usual. Been talking about this since release of his tax plan in the fall.
alivitali	687844195680256000	2016-01-15T03:50:10	Corporate inversion!
alivitali	687843871330594816	2016-01-15T03:48:53	If Trump gets an answer in on this ? about companies leaving America, prepare to hear promises not to eat Oreos and the name "Ford."

alivitali	687842137321410560	2016-01-15T03:41:59	Nick_NoHeart wow, that's really saying something. New(Accidental)Low
alivitali	687842050700632064	2016-01-15T03:41:39	It did come out of no where; seemed gratuitous after an exchange on tariffs and currency manipulation 
alivitali	687841546478182400	2016-01-15T03:39:38	"Come on, man" Jeb says when Trump calls him "weak."
alivitali	687841250800701440	2016-01-15T03:38:28	He's said of news outlets that his favor ebbs and flows depending on their coverage.  
alivitali	687840303139696641	2016-01-15T03:34:42	My mom (who was on Court TV back in the day) just texts me: "Ct TV!!!" A bit delayed, but love the passion. TextsFromPange
alivitali	687839411984330755	2016-01-15T03:31:09	.JebBush the only one on stage giving tangible steps and ideas on how to "solve the problem" of ISIS, countering Trump's Muslim ban plan.
alivitali	687838735229153280	2016-01-15T03:28:28	Also: Trump and Cruz haven't sparred over allegations from Trump that Cruz has copied his border security plan. Wait for it...
alivitali	687838345762836480	2016-01-15T03:26:55	Notice that Trump mushes Muslim and Syrian refugee issues into one, but Christie, Kasich designate between the two.
alivitali	687838055131164672	2016-01-15T03:25:46	This is actually a great exercise, all these candidates having to weigh in on where they stand on Muslim ban vs. refugee pause vs. not
alivitali	687837796791402497	2016-01-15T03:24:44	Again, this all sounds off the cuff but this is stuff that Trump says on the trail all the time regarding immigration, refugees, Muslim ban.
alivitali	687837329722052609	2016-01-15T03:22:53	This is Bush's best moment. Making appeal to Trump to rethink Muslim comments. "All Muslims? Seriously? What kind of signal does that send":
alivitali	687837281709895680	2016-01-15T03:22:42	I asked Trump supporters minutes after Trump's Muslim ban was put out and most were all for it: 
alivitali	687836759015747584	2016-01-15T03:20:37	This is Trump's stump speech rational for the temporary Muslim ban.
alivitali	687833372119425024	2016-01-15T03:07:09	Not that this was the crux of their exchange, but just another layer there. 
alivitali	687832857528692736	2016-01-15T03:05:07	"Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan" is a direct reax to when Trump said of Cruz not many Evangelicals come out of Cuba.
alivitali	687832304438394880	2016-01-15T03:02:55	Ah, the long awaited NY values question. Trump's retort on this was actually spot on: 
alivitali	687831552324145153	2016-01-15T02:59:56	Christie directly addresses Obama to camera on guns, his failed policies (if he's watching, which Christie is hoping he is).

alivitali	687830251142000642	2016-01-15T02:54:45	Trump has been giving this answer abt Paris + San Bernardino since those events happened. Now he applies them to gun control on the trail.
alivitali	687829901475463171	2016-01-15T02:53:22	What we'll prob hear from most of these guys now on guns is we dont need more rules, lets just use what we already have.
alivitali	687827240567095296	2016-01-15T02:42:48	Christie suggested the .50 caliber ban

alivitali	687822223835557888	2016-01-15T02:22:51	Cruz always so practiced and precise when hitting the media.
alivitali	687821470622453760	2016-01-15T02:19:52	The past few days Trump has been reciting Al Wilson's "The Snake" to describe Syrian refugee crisis. Somehow think he won't tonight...

alivitali	687819825255694336	2016-01-15T02:13:20	And now on to Jeb(!) who says the world has been "torn asunder" and then says POTUS uses "grandiose language."

alivitali	687818351742218240	2016-01-15T02:07:28	Except he didn't get to answer that question! And the 2nd one goes to Kasich. First time Trump hasn't been among the first voices.
alivitali	687817848555749376	2016-01-15T02:05:28	Prepare for Trump to talk about what he sees as the *actual* unemployment rate during this jobs/econ question. He doesn't believe BLS s.
