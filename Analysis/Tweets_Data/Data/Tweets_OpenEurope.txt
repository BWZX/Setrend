OpenEurope	690180005301743617	2016-01-21T14:31:50	Draghi says adverse external developments are "no good reason to give up".
OpenEurope	690179749713428480	2016-01-21T14:30:49	Draghi: View of Gov Council is we should reject any suggestion that we'd do less than what is necessary to achieve inflation objectives.
OpenEurope	690178627934228480	2016-01-21T14:26:22	Draghi: I abstained from blaming markets as such. Communication is a two-way affair. Very hard to put blame on one side only.
OpenEurope	690177659851120644	2016-01-21T14:22:31	Draghi: Fiscal consolidation must be growth-friendly, namely based on tax cuts, gov't spending control and high-return investment.
OpenEurope	690177473879871488	2016-01-21T14:21:47	Draghi: I don't think there's any disagreement between ECB and EU Commission on fiscal policy.
OpenEurope	690177345261604866	2016-01-21T14:21:16	Draghi: Spain is on its way to continue recovery and structural reforms. Very low inflation rates make internal devaluation more difficult.
OpenEurope	690177188512055300	2016-01-21T14:20:39	Draghi: Spain is one of the countries that has really made significant progress in structural reforms.
OpenEurope	690176847259242497	2016-01-21T14:19:17	Draghi: I don't think markets disagree with SSM assessment of NPLs, but there's been significant amount of confusion.
OpenEurope	690176565766950912	2016-01-21T14:18:10	Draghi: When we value NPLs, we need to be aware that a single number doesn't mean anything. There are NPLs of different kinds.
OpenEurope	690175992082665472	2016-01-21T14:15:54	Draghi: SSM [ECB supervisory arm] is fully aware it takes years to deal with NPLs effectively.
OpenEurope	690175725790453760	2016-01-21T14:14:50	Draghi: No new unexpected provisioning nor new unexpected request for capital will be made by the supervisor.
OpenEurope	690175579623165952	2016-01-21T14:14:15	Draghi: NPLs were fully identified by our comprehensive assessment. Provisioning against NPLs was also fully determined.
OpenEurope	690174982253625344	2016-01-21T14:11:53	Draghi: It's quite clear we see major movements in market place. Very difficult to assess whether these are short-term or persisting.
OpenEurope	690174179556093952	2016-01-21T14:08:41	Draghi: Even when we look at wage developments, core inflation, we don't have many reasons to be optimistic.
OpenEurope	690173377680637952	2016-01-21T14:05:30	Draghi: There's very little I can do about how refugee situation is seen in one specific country [i.e. Germany].
OpenEurope	690173033131163648	2016-01-21T14:04:08	Draghi: Effect of China developments on commodity markets have been quite visible.
OpenEurope	690172859910602754	2016-01-21T14:03:27	Draghi: 3 developments in China - stock market, PMI weaker than expected, overall situation in Forex Market.
OpenEurope	690172710895353856	2016-01-21T14:02:51	Draghi: Reference to China in accounts of our last meeting ought to be read as opinions of some participants to discussion.
OpenEurope	690172056139403265	2016-01-21T14:00:15	Draghi: All actions undertaken both in Europe and elsewhere in the world have produced much stronger banking sector than before the crisis.
OpenEurope	690171496615055360	2016-01-21T13:58:02	Draghi: Our mandate is a mandate to reach price stability, not exactly a mandate to protect banks' and insurance companies' profitability.
OpenEurope	690171366214127616	2016-01-21T13:57:31	Draghi: We're monitoring markets and financial sector in general, trying to see whether our monetary policy could be source of instability.
OpenEurope	690170872037019648	2016-01-21T13:55:33	Draghi: It is also in our hands the opportunity, capacity and ability to transform this development in opportunity for future growth.
OpenEurope	690170769008115713	2016-01-21T13:55:08	Draghi: Refugees are an extraordinary development which is and will be changing the face of our society in Europe.
OpenEurope	690170113434193920	2016-01-21T13:52:32	Draghi: It's pretty clear that we're adapting our instruments to changing conditions. Conditions change because global factors are at play.
OpenEurope	690169960627355648	2016-01-21T13:51:56	Draghi: Governing Council was unanimous in being committed to this line of communication.
OpenEurope	690169801814085632	2016-01-21T13:51:18	Draghi: Credibility of ECB would be harmed if we were not ready to review and possibly reconsider our monetary policy stance.
OpenEurope	690169530841194496	2016-01-21T13:50:13	Draghi: Since December, circumstances have changed. Just think about oil price has fallen.
OpenEurope	690169443784224768	2016-01-21T13:49:52	Draghi: Our measures were appropriate in December, but based on circumstances that were prevailing at that time.
OpenEurope	690169315333664768	2016-01-21T13:49:22	Draghi: Our monetary policy measures have been quite effective. Pass-through quite significant, if not spectacular.
OpenEurope	690168637202829312	2016-01-21T13:46:40	Draghi: We didn't want to discuss specifics of instruments today, but rather assess stance we may have to take in March.
OpenEurope	690168530533228544	2016-01-21T13:46:15	Draghi: Let me recall what I said in NY speech. We have power, willingness and determination to act.
OpenEurope	690168026864443393	2016-01-21T13:44:14	Draghi: All countries should strive for more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policy.
OpenEurope	690167937303470082	2016-01-21T13:43:53	Draghi: Fiscal policy should support economic recovery while remaining in compliance with EU fiscal rules.
OpenEurope	690167751181209601	2016-01-21T13:43:09	Draghi: Current cyclical recovery should be supported by structural measures.
OpenEurope	690167682323353600	2016-01-21T13:42:52	Draghi: In order to reap full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas need to contribute decisively.
OpenEurope	690167434137985025	2016-01-21T13:41:53	Draghi: Overall, monetary policy measures in place since June 2014 have clearly improved borrowing conditions, as well as credit flows.
OpenEurope	690167204894105600	2016-01-21T13:40:58	Draghi: Annual growth rate of loans to households increased to 1.4% in November 2015 compared to 1.2% in October 2015.
OpenEurope	690167072572178433	2016-01-21T13:40:27	Draghi: Annual rate of change of loans to NFCs increased to 0.9% in November 2015.
OpenEurope	690166840165842944	2016-01-21T13:39:32	Draghi: Recent data confirm solid growth in broad money (M3), with annual rate of growth standing at 5.1% in November 2015.
OpenEurope	690166681696600064	2016-01-21T13:38:54	Draghi: Risks of 2nd round effects on inflation should be monitored closely.
OpenEurope	690166596942348289	2016-01-21T13:38:34	Draghi: Inflation rates are expected to remain at very low or negative levels in coming months, and pick up only later in 2016.
OpenEurope	690166490482499585	2016-01-21T13:38:08	Draghi: Based on current oil future prices, expected path of annual HICP inflation in 2016 is now significantly lower.
OpenEurope	690166341261750273	2016-01-21T13:37:33	Draghi: € area annual HICP inflation was 0.2% in December 2015, compared with 0.1% in November. December outcome was lower than expected.
OpenEurope	690166197741027331	2016-01-21T13:36:58	So...Draghi can still talk down the euro it seems...EURUSD. Seen to be strong hint of March easing 
OpenEurope	690166227797434368	2016-01-21T13:37:06	Draghi: Risks to € area growth outlook remain on the downside, and relate mainly to uncertainty in developments in global economy.
OpenEurope	690166099560796160	2016-01-21T13:36:35	Draghi: Fiscal stance in € area has become more expansionary, mainly reflecting measures in support of refugees.
OpenEurope	690165970346889218	2016-01-21T13:36:04	Draghi: Renewed fall in oil prices should provide further support for households real disposable income.
OpenEurope	690165775307509760	2016-01-21T13:35:18	Draghi: € area real GDP growth came in at 0.3% Q/Q in Q3 2015, supported mainly by household consumption.
OpenEurope	690165527055089664	2016-01-21T13:34:18	Draghi: It will be necessary to review and possibly reconsider our monetary policy stance at our meeting in March.
OpenEurope	690165430741237762	2016-01-21T13:33:55	Draghi: In this environment, € area inflation dynamics also continue to be weaker than expected.
OpenEurope	690165338328166400	2016-01-21T13:33:33	Draghi: Yet, as we start the year downside risks have increased again.
OpenEurope	690165234678497280	2016-01-21T13:33:09	Draghi: Decision to extend our monthly asset purchases to at least the end of March 2017 was fully appropriate.
OpenEurope	690165114398478336	2016-01-21T13:32:40	Draghi: Developments in real economy, credit provision and financial conditions have improved and strengthened € area resilience.
OpenEurope	690165013194108928	2016-01-21T13:32:16	Draghi: We expect interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for long period of time.
OpenEurope	690164955623116800	2016-01-21T13:32:02	Draghi: Based on our regular analysis, we decided to keep key interest rates unchanged.
OpenEurope	690164615083397121	2016-01-21T13:30:41	ECB President Draghi about to start his press conference in Frankfurt.
