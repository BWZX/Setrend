Frances_Coppola	725222758976741376	2016-04-27T07:19:14	PDWriter ArlissBunny 1whoknu bill1303 of course. But as money is the intermediary agent, its availability influences price.
Frances_Coppola	725221557883289601	2016-04-27T07:14:28	ArlissBunny and that is why governments need to spend to raise demand. Money Is the means by which demand is influenced.
Frances_Coppola	725221147973959681	2016-04-27T07:12:50	ArlissBunny clearly, the availability of money DOES matter....if there isn't enough of it, demand falls, by definition.
Frances_Coppola	725220561929031680	2016-04-27T07:10:30	ArlissBunny it's not an "either/or". Inflation is a rise in the value of goods &amp; services and a corresponding fall in the value of money.
Frances_Coppola	725219636808179712	2016-04-27T07:06:50	But spending increases the money supply!  
Frances_Coppola	725219360328011776	2016-04-27T07:05:44	Now it is you who are using gold standard thinking. Increasing bank reserves doesn't raise inflation.

Frances_Coppola	725082198408306688	2016-04-26T22:00:42	bill1303 And it's not all lumped on a single cohort. I'm not a WASPI woman, but I've had a 6-year rise in my pension age.
Frances_Coppola	725081918413352960	2016-04-26T21:59:35	bill1303 But it is gradual. The WASPI women weren't paying attention, so they didn't know about it. That's why they think it's sudden.
Frances_Coppola	725081408767705088	2016-04-26T21:57:33	bill1303 Actually it is largely due to the greater financial independence of women and rise in prosperity since the 1960s.

Frances_Coppola	725076560970145792	2016-04-26T21:38:18	bill1303 especially as both pensions and healthcare (in a developed country) are consumption spending, not investment - no multiplier.
Frances_Coppola	725076328484069376	2016-04-26T21:37:22	bill1303 the fact that spending precedes taxation doesn't mean you can print money ad infinitum with no tax implications.

Frances_Coppola	724473470256594944	2016-04-25T05:41:50	firstecache of course Jackson's hatred of the British model might have been related to Britain's abolition of the slave trade in 1807...
Frances_Coppola	724470872933830657	2016-04-25T05:31:30	firstecache I presume by "ecclesiastical corps" he means the Church of England. Don't see what that has to do with central banks, really.
Frances_Coppola	724464984139399168	2016-04-25T05:08:06	firstecache even today, the German cooperative banking systems have their own "central banks".
Frances_Coppola	724464359968243713	2016-04-25T05:05:37	firstecache remarkable that he described a free banking system organised geographically as a "perpetual monopoly".
Frances_Coppola	724463724216594433	2016-04-25T05:03:06	firstecache also Scotland had free banking until 1845: RBS and Bank of Scotland acted as central banks on geographic basis.
Frances_Coppola	724463072006541312	2016-04-25T05:00:30	firstecache JP Morgan acted as "central bank" pre-Fed.
Frances_Coppola	724462539489337345	2016-04-25T04:58:23	firstecache one other point: in the absence of a "national" bank, private banking systems create their own "central banks".
Frances_Coppola	724461830891016193	2016-04-25T04:55:34	firstecache if you want to criticise central banks for something, it should be that.
Frances_Coppola	724461681137594368	2016-04-25T04:54:59	firstecache central banks do not crowd out private banks, they make their growth possible. GS would not be the size it is without the Fed.
Frances_Coppola	724461382901587968	2016-04-25T04:53:48	firstecache at that time they financed government. Now, their job is to support private banks. Sea change in 20th century.
Frances_Coppola	724460680867393536	2016-04-25T04:51:00	firstecache I think you also should remember that central banks now do a very different job from that 200 years ago.
Frances_Coppola	724459395107721218	2016-04-25T04:45:54	firstecache the fact that he was anxious not to copy the British system does not invalidate what I said. He favoured state banks.
Frances_Coppola	724457897283981312	2016-04-25T04:39:57	firstecache really think you should bear in mind the historical context. This was very soon after Independence.
Frances_Coppola	724457535277830144	2016-04-25T04:38:30	firstecache with respect, an angry man hating everything abt Britain &amp; anxious to erase all trace of its influence is not a good role model

Frances_Coppola	724358854323089408	2016-04-24T22:06:23	MerijnKnibbe bingo. Terms of trade collapse. Rebound is due to dollar devaluation, I should think. 
Frances_Coppola	724355353769586689	2016-04-24T21:52:28	MerijnKnibbe I presume this is oil. The spike plus collapse is an exact reflection. So correction must be mainly due to terms of trade.
Frances_Coppola	724354995441831936	2016-04-24T21:51:03	MerijnKnibbe that's a very sharp correction. What was in the bubble?

Frances_Coppola	724340055351898112	2016-04-24T20:51:41	MerijnKnibbe I have a story that goes like this. Oil price spike was the exponential phase of an investment bubble. Burst in 2008 +

Frances_Coppola	724337674409115648	2016-04-24T20:42:13	MerijnKnibbe it's pretty striking: 
Frances_Coppola	724337337937833984	2016-04-24T20:40:53	MerijnKnibbe incidentally has anyone ever written anything about the causes of the 2008/9 oil price spike and collapse?
Frances_Coppola	724335530624843776	2016-04-24T20:33:42	jlounsbury59 very simple. Eurodollar market collapsed. Offshore dollars rebounded to onshore.
Frances_Coppola	724334782277144576	2016-04-24T20:30:44	MerijnKnibbe I'd been reading Blanchard from 2005 saying a sharp BoP correction wasn't likely. How wrong he was.
Frances_Coppola	724334523916386306	2016-04-24T20:29:42	MerijnKnibbe yeah, we seem to have forgotten that. Also terms of trade correction due to oil price weirdness (2008 spike, 2009 collapse)
Frances_Coppola	724334194151817216	2016-04-24T20:28:24	jmarcusnunes Still fascinating to see it in graphical form.

Frances_Coppola	724307316678483968	2016-04-24T18:41:35	Ade_Cunningham I would say that both the correction and the recession are caused by negative shocks.
Frances_Coppola	724306542615506944	2016-04-24T18:38:31	Ade_Cunningham sure. I was careful not to suggest causation.

Frances_Coppola	724279347641765888	2016-04-24T16:50:27	firstecache perhaps. The Eurozone is a sort of fledgling Federation, and interestingly has a deepening North/South divide.
Frances_Coppola	724277572629106689	2016-04-24T16:43:24	firstecache not least because the Eurozone is not a country and the ECB is not a "national bank".
Frances_Coppola	724277391456129024	2016-04-24T16:42:41	firstecache the views of Jackson and Jefferson are entirely irrelevant to the ECB.
Frances_Coppola	724277262024093696	2016-04-24T16:42:10	firstecache you should not extrapolate the views of American presidents about American institutions to the institutions of other countries.
Frances_Coppola	724276570156859394	2016-04-24T16:39:25	firstecache similarly Jackson was in favour of state banks, not a single national institution.
Frances_Coppola	724275916210331648	2016-04-24T16:36:49	firstecache as far as I know Jefferson expressed no opinion on the existence of national banks elsewhere, such as the Bank of England.
Frances_Coppola	724275746143920133	2016-04-24T16:36:08	firstecache which I think has more to do with the fact that the US before the Civil War was not a fully formed federation.
Frances_Coppola	724275599473258496	2016-04-24T16:35:33	firstecache Umm. Jefferson only opposed a national bank for the US because he was in favour of state banks.

Frances_Coppola	723563837765607424	2016-04-22T17:27:16	How can you have "contingent reforms", to be implemented "only if needed"? Either reforms are needed or they are not.

Frances_Coppola	723524429746155520	2016-04-22T14:50:41	And what Germany and the IMF disagree over is how much sustenance Greece needs to keep it alive.
Frances_Coppola	723524167065317377	2016-04-22T14:49:38	Greek counter-proposals last year were about as convincing as German ones in 1918 - which Keynes described as "obscure and disingenuous".
Frances_Coppola	723523084108611585	2016-04-22T14:45:20	brianmlucey Whatever.
Frances_Coppola	723522915463995392	2016-04-22T14:44:40	The MOU is NOT about restoring Greece's fortunes. It is about keeping Greece just alive enough to pay its creditors.
Frances_Coppola	723522527075684353	2016-04-22T14:43:07	But then, although there are weasel words in the MOU about "restoring growth", it isn't for Greece's benefit at all. It's for creditors.
Frances_Coppola	723521673350275072	2016-04-22T14:39:43	Although the draft MOU is described as "Greek owned and Greek led", this is a chimera, Acquiescence under duress is not "ownership".

Frances_Coppola	723518737085796353	2016-04-22T14:28:03	BChantzis Ah yes, the eventual debt relief. I hope Greece doesn't have to wait so long for hers - or lose a war.
Frances_Coppola	723518552423186432	2016-04-22T14:27:19	brianmlucey Ah yes. Decapitation as a morale booster.

Frances_Coppola	723515251602411520	2016-04-22T14:14:12	Indeed it may not get them their money back at all.
Frances_Coppola	723515201409134592	2016-04-22T14:14:00	Such a policy is counterproductive from the creditors' point of view too. It will not get them their money back any faster.
Frances_Coppola	723514983917694980	2016-04-22T14:13:09	It is not clear to me what Greece did that was so dreadful as to demand what amounts to a scorched-earth policy from its creditors.

Frances_Coppola	723507735137005568	2016-04-22T13:44:20	BChantzis It would, but this isn't about efficiency.
Frances_Coppola	723507612671680514	2016-04-22T13:43:51	and therefore avoid the unpleasant reality that debt is NOT sustainable. Inflict further pain on the Greek people to placate creditors.
Frances_Coppola	723507227575894016	2016-04-22T13:42:19	But then the 3.5% primary surplus target has nothing to do with economic reality. It exists to preserve the fiction that debt is sustainable
Frances_Coppola	723506463042375680	2016-04-22T13:39:17	Even the IMF's suggested 1.5% primary surplus would be hard to sustain in an economy as damaged as Greece's.
Frances_Coppola	723506166333104128	2016-04-22T13:38:06	3.5% primary surplus is no more sustainable than the 4.5% primary surplus agreed to by Samaras in 2012.  Greece

Frances_Coppola	723497780384305152	2016-04-22T13:04:47	Remember that the 3% (+2%) fiscal squeeze would be done without monetary offset. Greece is excluded from ECB QE.
Frances_Coppola	723497455761936384	2016-04-22T13:03:30	Italians4Brexit BChantzis that was what the IMF said in the famous leaked phone call
Frances_Coppola	723497331094642689	2016-04-22T13:03:00	Germany's position is untenable. No way can a 3.5% primary surplus be sustained for decades. It is nonsense to say so, and deeply damaging.
Frances_Coppola	723496942920196097	2016-04-22T13:01:27	It's also impossible.  
Frances_Coppola	723496836049281024	2016-04-22T13:01:02	Imho it is time the IMF followed through on its threat not to participate unless Germany backs down on "no debt relief".
Frances_Coppola	723496236465160192	2016-04-22T12:58:39	Italians4Brexit BChantzis Yes there will. In June.
Frances_Coppola	723496164272779264	2016-04-22T12:58:22	No way can a fiscal squeeze of 3% of GDP, plus a FURTHER 2% when (not if) Greece fails to meet targets, do anything but more economic damage
Frances_Coppola	723495640110641153	2016-04-22T12:56:17	.SpiegelPeter Germany hasn't "suddenly decided" that debt relief is not needed. That's always been Schaueble's position.

Frances_Coppola	723086568261562368	2016-04-21T09:50:46	Theo_Clifford training is a cost. Though trainees still have to live. Who is supporting your sister so the company doesn't have to?
Frances_Coppola	723086085996318721	2016-04-21T09:48:51	Theo_Clifford I am not talking about trainees. By definition they aren't skilled people.

Frances_Coppola	723084967580958721	2016-04-21T09:44:25	cjenscook and right now, I don't care about "other value". It's an excuse not to pay people for their work.

Frances_Coppola	723084473399693312	2016-04-21T09:42:27	Theo_Clifford This is a side issue. I'm talking about companies expecting skilled people to work for nothing, or next to nothing.

Frances_Coppola	721671090309881857	2016-04-17T12:06:10	The sad tale of the Manchester Building Society, broken by the mammoth incompetence of its own accountants. 
Frances_Coppola	721644502553870336	2016-04-17T10:20:31	Sjg3G JohnRalfe1 CashQuestions IFRS9 is a flawed standard, I agree. But the accountants should have applied it correctly.
Frances_Coppola	721644286413037568	2016-04-17T10:19:40	Sjg3G JohnRalfe1 CashQuestions so even if there was an economic hedge they couldn't afford the P&amp;L hit.
Frances_Coppola	721643900960706560	2016-04-17T10:18:08	Sjg3G JohnRalfe1 CashQuestions that and the fact that fair value diff must be taken to P&amp;L while amortisation  remains on balance sheet
Frances_Coppola	721643681879625729	2016-04-17T10:17:15	Sjg3G JohnRalfe1 CashQuestions no....the valuation of the assets is the problem!
Frances_Coppola	721643528338677760	2016-04-17T10:16:39	Sjg3G JohnRalfe1 CashQuestions they would have needed a different structure for a full or partial hedge with correct accounting.
Frances_Coppola	721643267490725888	2016-04-17T10:15:37	Sjg3G JohnRalfe1 CashQuestions what I am saying is you can't ignore the accounting bcs it was fundamental to this particular structure
Frances_Coppola	721643078667382784	2016-04-17T10:14:52	Sjg3G JohnRalfe1 CashQuestions no way of recognising it. Fair value accounting of mortgages had to be completely unwound.
Frances_Coppola	721642839227162624	2016-04-17T10:13:55	Sjg3G JohnRalfe1 CashQuestions the swaps they used violated IFRS9 criteria
Frances_Coppola	721642724957544448	2016-04-17T10:13:27	JohnRalfe1 Sjg3G CashQuestions in this case the hedge economics depended on the accounting standard
Frances_Coppola	721642588693000193	2016-04-17T10:12:55	JohnRalfe1 Sjg3G CashQuestions no it isn't. You can't carry mortgages at fair value unless you intend to sell them.
Frances_Coppola	721642412809043968	2016-04-17T10:12:13	Sjg3G JohnRalfe1 CashQuestions whether there could have been a partial hedge with correct accounting is a different matter.
Frances_Coppola	721642123485962241	2016-04-17T10:11:04	Sjg3G JohnRalfe1 CashQuestions they accounted for it as perfect hedge based on carrying mortgages at fair value instead of amortised cost
Frances_Coppola	721641871756365824	2016-04-17T10:10:04	JohnRalfe1 Sjg3G CashQuestions in other words, the accounting standard is fundamental to the construction of the hedge, not an add-on
Frances_Coppola	721641623613022208	2016-04-17T10:09:05	JohnRalfe1 Sjg3G CashQuestions there may have been a possible economic hedge, but this structure didn't deliver it.
Frances_Coppola	721641436270227456	2016-04-17T10:08:20	JohnRalfe1 Sjg3G CashQuestions hedge was constructed entirely on assumption that both swaps and mortgages could be carried at fair value
Frances_Coppola	721641126709563392	2016-04-17T10:07:06	JohnRalfe1 CashQuestions Sjg3G the hedges only worked because the accounting was wrong. When that was corrected there was no hedge.
Frances_Coppola	721638859113644032	2016-04-17T09:58:06	LisaMuggeridge But that doesn't mean it has nothing useful to add.

Frances_Coppola	721638363145613313	2016-04-17T09:56:07	LisaMuggeridge And just to be clear. I don't disagree with you about that. It is not a panacea.

Frances_Coppola	721608841343971328	2016-04-17T07:58:49	Sjg3G CashQuestions JohnRalfe1 which cost them another £7.6m. Then they had add whopping provisions on dodgy acquired mortgages
Frances_Coppola	721608480302489600	2016-04-17T07:57:23	Sjg3G CashQuestions JohnRalfe1 but it wasn't the only accounting error, though probably the stupidest. They had to restate 2012 accts too
Frances_Coppola	721608128199004160	2016-04-17T07:55:59	Sjg3G CashQuestions JohnRalfe1 yes. They had to unwind the attempted hedge completely. Total P&amp;L hit more than £15m.
Frances_Coppola	721607332438913024	2016-04-17T07:52:49	Sjg3G CashQuestions JohnRalfe1 yes exactly!
Frances_Coppola	721607199924056064	2016-04-17T07:52:17	Sjg3G CashQuestions JohnRalfe1 They do not mention ER mortgages. Fixed rate could be anything - no reason to assume ER.
Frances_Coppola	721605532558172160	2016-04-17T07:45:40	CashQuestions Sjg3G JohnRalfe1 really damaging error was on simple fixed rate mortgages hedged with simple IR swaps. Simple incompetence.
Frances_Coppola	721605062288674818	2016-04-17T07:43:48	Sjg3G CashQuestions JohnRalfe1 No. They divested the swaps.
Frances_Coppola	721604926409990144	2016-04-17T07:43:15	Sjg3G CashQuestions JohnRalfe1 they may also have been hedging ER, but the wrong fair value accounting was on fixed rate mortgages.
Frances_Coppola	721604331141771264	2016-04-17T07:40:53	Sjg3G CashQuestions JohnRalfe1 that is not what their report &amp; accounts say. I have read them. In detail.
Frances_Coppola	721603860863840256	2016-04-17T07:39:01	CashQuestions Sjg3G JohnRalfe1 most BSs do that. But they tried to create a perfect hedge, which you can't do bcs of accounting rules.
Frances_Coppola	721603564196524033	2016-04-17T07:37:51	CashQuestions Sjg3G JohnRalfe1 No, Annie. It was much more straightforward. They were hedging interest rate risk on fixed rate mortgages.
Frances_Coppola	721603269731217408	2016-04-17T07:36:40	Sjg3G CashQuestions JohnRalfe1 They were hedging interest rate risk on fixed rate mortgages. I did say this. Did you read my piece?
Frances_Coppola	721602729328701440	2016-04-17T07:34:32	Sjg3G JohnRalfe there wd have been a partial hedge. But bcs they misused IFRS 9 to create a perfect hedge, they ended up with no hedge.
Frances_Coppola	721602011574181888	2016-04-17T07:31:40	CashQuestions Sjg3G JohnRalfe1 fixed rate mortgages. They were hedging interest rate risk. Probably in the wrong direction.
Frances_Coppola	721532739246301185	2016-04-17T02:56:25	Desired response is "WBTSDS", either way.
Frances_Coppola	721532108737548288	2016-04-17T02:53:54	If fiscal stimulus (with CB blessing) is equivalent to raising inflation target, then does raising inflation target invite fiscal stimulus?
Frances_Coppola	721531481999478784	2016-04-17T02:51:25	So, about doing things without being seen to do so (WBTSDS). You know, like IMF's "new ways of borrowing" that don't invoke bond vigilantes.

Frances_Coppola	721513822721339393	2016-04-17T01:41:15	CoombesMostyn I have not said any such thing.

Frances_Coppola	721510459644493824	2016-04-17T01:27:53	CoombesMostyn Bank of England is wholly owned by the Government. Was nationalised in 1946.
Frances_Coppola	721510204274262018	2016-04-17T01:26:52	CoombesMostyn No they aren't.
Frances_Coppola	721510050955665408	2016-04-17T01:26:15	CoombesMostyn you misunderstand the infographic. Private banks do not create notes and coins.
Frances_Coppola	721509587543834624	2016-04-17T01:24:25	CoombesMostyn so I repeat, I do not know what you are proposing. Government produces all notes &amp; coins in England &amp; Wales.
Frances_Coppola	721509272039895040	2016-04-17T01:23:10	CoombesMostyn and government does produce e-money, on which it charges interest - in UK currently 0.5%.

Frances_Coppola	721507648168968192	2016-04-17T01:16:42	CoombesMostyn we do not have private bank notes in England &amp; Wales. We do in Scotland &amp; NI, but they are backed by public currency.
Frances_Coppola	721506905689059329	2016-04-17T01:13:45	CoombesMostyn why do you want to nationalise the banking system?

Frances_Coppola	721496828190048256	2016-04-17T00:33:43	LisaMuggeridge that isn't what your piece said. You implied the only people promoting UBI see it as welfare substitute. That is not true.

Frances_Coppola	721496323162259456	2016-04-17T00:31:42	LisaMuggeridge but your piece simply damns the whole concept of UBI because it doesn't solve specific welfare problems - which we know
Frances_Coppola	721496081851359232	2016-04-17T00:30:45	LisaMuggeridge I think we are at cross purposes. You are talking about UBI as replacement for welfare. I do not see it as that.
Frances_Coppola	721495777001005057	2016-04-17T00:29:32	LisaMuggeridge I don't think damning UBI solves anything.
Frances_Coppola	721495541344006144	2016-04-17T00:28:36	LisaMuggeridge I am a supporter of UBI, Lisa. Please accept that.
Frances_Coppola	721495187973894144	2016-04-17T00:27:12	LisaMuggeridge with respect, you are damning an entire idea because a particular version of it doesn't fit with your world view.

Frances_Coppola	721493980899360772	2016-04-17T00:22:24	LisaMuggeridge I do not agree with the Greens proposal, and I have issues with Painter's - which I have discussed with him.
Frances_Coppola	721493607161733120	2016-04-17T00:20:55	LisaMuggeridge why do you assume that?
Frances_Coppola	721493500420874240	2016-04-17T00:20:29	LisaMuggeridge it IS the foundation. We just don't recognise it. That's why everything is piecemeal.
Frances_Coppola	721493275300012032	2016-04-17T00:19:36	LisaMuggeridge some are. Not all.
Frances_Coppola	721493139983306752	2016-04-17T00:19:03	LisaMuggeridge I support UBI. But not as a solution to present welfare problems. As I said, that misses the  point.
Frances_Coppola	721492829088952320	2016-04-17T00:17:49	LisaMuggeridge disagree. UBI sets the floor. Or foundation.
Frances_Coppola	721492546413805568	2016-04-17T00:16:42	LisaMuggeridge you are seeing this from only one perspective.....
Frances_Coppola	721492346639093761	2016-04-17T00:15:54	LisaMuggeridge I don't think UBI support is growing out of disaffection with the welfare system.
Frances_Coppola	721492143949352960	2016-04-17T00:15:06	LisaMuggeridge if you only see it from a welfare standpoint, that is true. But that is only one perspective.
Frances_Coppola	721491645473103872	2016-04-17T00:13:07	LisaMuggeridge if you start by regarding UBI as simply a replacement for existing benefits you miss the point.
Frances_Coppola	721491298142785536	2016-04-17T00:11:44	LisaMuggeridge UBI is not an unemployment benefits system. That's a fallacy.
Frances_Coppola	721491069519716356	2016-04-17T00:10:50	LisaMuggeridge I've told him that.
Frances_Coppola	721491020127604737	2016-04-17T00:10:38	LisaMuggeridge I disagree with aspects of his proposal, and I don't like his exclusion of matters (eg housing) he finds too difficult.

Frances_Coppola	718444096998797313	2016-04-08T14:23:15	DrJimboNHS Gilesyb and my point is the evidence does not support your argument, except for Africa.
Frances_Coppola	718443957861150721	2016-04-08T14:22:42	DrJimboNHS Gilesyb it really isn't what I'm saying. But it is what YOU are saying.

Frances_Coppola	718441660208820224	2016-04-08T14:13:34	.DrJimboNHS Gilesyb you do not have a monopoly on the definition of "democracy". No-one in the rich West does.
Frances_Coppola	718441408798060544	2016-04-08T14:12:34	DrJimboNHS Gilesyb PutneyDebates I have said no such thing.
Frances_Coppola	718441134771585024	2016-04-08T14:11:29	ahavery JohnRalfe1 sensible.
Frances_Coppola	718441064760274947	2016-04-08T14:11:12	DrJimboNHS Gilesyb no, that way lies self-determination.
Frances_Coppola	718440066096492544	2016-04-08T14:07:14	ahavery JohnRalfe1 But in pre-2008 days you could remortgage to release the equity and spend it on a holiday in Barbados. wealtheffects
Frances_Coppola	718439649828581376	2016-04-08T14:05:35	DrJimboNHS Gilesyb You say you are against "undemocratic governments". I say your definition of "democratic government" is imperialist.
Frances_Coppola	718439263159906304	2016-04-08T14:04:02	DrJimboNHS Gilesyb where did I defend the status quo? I like free trade. We don't have free trade.
Frances_Coppola	718439043487375360	2016-04-08T14:03:10	DrJimboNHS Gilesyb PutneyDebates where did I defend big corporate power, James? I think you made that up.
Frances_Coppola	718435710169190404	2016-04-08T13:49:55	IronEconomist also, if negative rates fully passed on, most cash also would have negative yield - only physical cash zero yield.
Frances_Coppola	718435099252011008	2016-04-08T13:47:30	IronEconomist seriously, I do not think any of these effects play out as you think.
Frances_Coppola	718434950031282176	2016-04-08T13:46:54	IronEconomist no it isn't, if you want capital appreciation.
Frances_Coppola	718434857735602179	2016-04-08T13:46:32	IronEconomist they also depend on time preferences, which with ageing populations and high debt levels are possibly negative.
Frances_Coppola	718434676080291841	2016-04-08T13:45:49	IronEconomist and why would they want to draw down their pensions early like that anyway? They might just want higher pension later.
Frances_Coppola	718434485637918721	2016-04-08T13:45:03	IronEconomist what would be the point of "sitting in cash"?
Frances_Coppola	718434254871506945	2016-04-08T13:44:08	IronEconomist but people may want to spend later, not now. That's the point of savings.
Frances_Coppola	718434126827806721	2016-04-08T13:43:38	IronEconomist spending unrealised gains from bond/stock/ house price increases is INCREDIBLY stupid.
Frances_Coppola	718433942441996289	2016-04-08T13:42:54	IronEconomist which IMHO is what they do.
Frances_Coppola	718433886888402944	2016-04-08T13:42:41	IronEconomist so they may simply hang on to their savings, or temporarily shift them to riskier assets, waiting for int rates to revert.
Frances_Coppola	718433744068194304	2016-04-08T13:42:07	IronEconomist with temp neg rate expectation that interest rates will revert to positive overrides expectation that prices will go up IMHO.
Frances_Coppola	718433452815687680	2016-04-08T13:40:57	JohnRalfe1 same stupidity. Also "my house has gone up in value".
Frances_Coppola	718433318434435074	2016-04-08T13:40:25	IronEconomist and why do you want ppl to run down their rainy day savings anyway?
Frances_Coppola	718433223353704448	2016-04-08T13:40:02	IronEconomist point is that supermarket substitution is only about consumption spending decisions. Not equivalent to spending vs saving.
Frances_Coppola	718433004247519233	2016-04-08T13:39:10	IronEconomist disagree. Widespread search for yield creates Ro-Ro behaviour, which is destabilising.
Frances_Coppola	718432635580755969	2016-04-08T13:37:42	IronEconomist switching from one supermarket to another makes no difference to the spending vs saving decision. Is all consumption.
Frances_Coppola	718432403430240257	2016-04-08T13:36:47	IronEconomist but IMHO driving people into riskier asset classes creates financial instability.
Frances_Coppola	718432280646193152	2016-04-08T13:36:18	IronEconomist no reason to assume savers would switch to consumption spending. They might take more risk in search for yield....
Frances_Coppola	718431978564034561	2016-04-08T13:35:06	IronEconomist I don't think the spending vs saving decision is that straightforward. Savers may switch to zero-yielding assets such as gold
Frances_Coppola	718431582995030016	2016-04-08T13:33:31	IronEconomist savers may decide that they need the buffer and will simply put up with lower returns. Or they may even save more.
Frances_Coppola	718431390895906816	2016-04-08T13:32:46	IronEconomist why?
Frances_Coppola	718431138423955456	2016-04-08T13:31:45	IronEconomist yes, so that is substitution not new spending.
Frances_Coppola	718430845154013184	2016-04-08T13:30:35	IronEconomist but negative rates do not necessarily flow through into consumer prices.
Frances_Coppola	718430672990400512	2016-04-08T13:29:54	IronEconomist yes but that is mostly substitution, surely?
Frances_Coppola	718430365266878465	2016-04-08T13:28:41	IronEconomist although it might encourage round-tripping and carry trades. Is that a good idea?
Frances_Coppola	718430135544844288	2016-04-08T13:27:46	IronEconomist maybe. I doubt if there is much effect if low rates are believed to be very short-term, though.
Frances_Coppola	718428667085504512	2016-04-08T13:21:56	One thing I don't like about Frances_Coppola , always pussy-footing around, not getting to the point ...

Frances_Coppola	718399921808912384	2016-04-08T11:27:43	DrJimboNHS Gilesyb PutneyDebates so if rich Western countries reduce imports, developing countries suffer.
Frances_Coppola	718399762341457921	2016-04-08T11:27:05	DrJimboNHS Gilesyb PutneyDebates do you understand that rich world imports help to improve living stds in developing countries?

Frances_Coppola	718394784780566529	2016-04-08T11:07:18	DrJimboNHS PutneyDebates Gilesyb and universal healthcare is not universal anyway. Rich Western world innovation.

Frances_Coppola	718394216167186438	2016-04-08T11:05:02	DrJimboNHS PutneyDebates Gilesyb external trade long precedes universal healthcare.
Frances_Coppola	718391837820653569	2016-04-08T10:55:35	PutneyDebates DrJimboNHS Gilesyb YES. That's the point.

Frances_Coppola	718390836225011712	2016-04-08T10:51:37	PutneyDebates DrJimboNHS Gilesyb that's a very sweeping statement, and not what the IMF actually says.

Frances_Coppola	718373277643751424	2016-04-08T09:41:50	PutneyDebates Gilesyb DrJimboNHS That is not what I said. Countries have to be wealthy in order to afford universal healthcare.
Frances_Coppola	718372859815575554	2016-04-08T09:40:11	DrJimboNHS PutneyDebates Gilesyb no

Frances_Coppola	718372390657527809	2016-04-08T09:38:19	PutneyDebates Gilesyb DrJimboNHS false dichotomy. Universal healthcare REQUIRES more income - and that comes from trade

Frances_Coppola	718371746492084225	2016-04-08T09:35:45	DrJimboNHS PutneyDebates Gilesyb Individual (median) income rise is definitely the best metric for judging improving living standards.

Frances_Coppola	718105411447091201	2016-04-07T15:57:26	PeterPannier but that is exactly what I was saying
Frances_Coppola	718094847010320386	2016-04-07T15:15:27	PeterPannier I do not like the current trend towards protectionism in the West. I think it is entirely counterproductive.
Frances_Coppola	718094593259081733	2016-04-07T15:14:27	PeterPannier go and look at BrankoMilan's work on incomes in developing countries.
Frances_Coppola	718093227061022720	2016-04-07T15:09:01	PeterPannier So don't call it free trade. Now if you will excuse me I have to go out. Goodbye.
Frances_Coppola	718093012052680705	2016-04-07T15:08:10	matango68 PeterPannier you don't get real wage increases if the benefits from trade are going to the very rich. That's America's problem
Frances_Coppola	718092870603968512	2016-04-07T15:07:36	matango68 PeterPannier The Bush administration cut taxes for the rich. There was no justification for this.
Frances_Coppola	718092627367890946	2016-04-07T15:06:38	PeterPannier it is NOT FREE TRADE. Please stop calling it that. Really misleading and wrong.
Frances_Coppola	718092380663058434	2016-04-07T15:05:39	PeterPannier I've heard him say it more than once
Frances_Coppola	718092303823421440	2016-04-07T15:05:21	matango68 PeterPannier no it is not. It is a result of trade manipulation and distortion - which is NOT "free trade".
Frances_Coppola	718092160281743360	2016-04-07T15:04:47	PeterPannier matango68 yes that IS what he is saying.
Frances_Coppola	718092075397431296	2016-04-07T15:04:26	PeterPannier matango68 making developing countries pay for America's failure to deal with its own distributional problems is outrageous.
Frances_Coppola	718091919105122304	2016-04-07T15:03:49	PeterPannier matango68 America's problem is its inequality. It did not have to pursue tax and trade policies that benefited the rich.
Frances_Coppola	718091784182738945	2016-04-07T15:03:17	PeterPannier matango68 and I'm sorry but I cannot in conscience agree with that. I think it is morally wrong.
Frances_Coppola	718091678800822274	2016-04-07T15:02:52	PeterPannier matango68 he's basically saying developing countries should stay poor to preserve the incomes of low-middle class Americans
Frances_Coppola	718091518033195008	2016-04-07T15:02:14	PeterPannier matango68 I think it is very easy, actually - as long as you take a global view. American parochialism is hard work though.
Frances_Coppola	718091383312105472	2016-04-07T15:01:41	matango68 PeterPannier PutneyDebates Gilesyb you are calling unfair regulations and trade manipulation "free trade" when it is not.
Frances_Coppola	718091226256379904	2016-04-07T15:01:04	matango68 PeterPannier PutneyDebates Gilesyb no, it ISN'T. It is a consequence of trade manipulation  - which is not "free trade".
Frances_Coppola	718090730078662656	2016-04-07T14:59:06	PeterPannier matango68 I'm all in favour of such improvements. But they should start at home. US is VERY unequal. Shd address that first.
Frances_Coppola	718090431087648769	2016-04-07T14:57:54	matango68 PeterPannier PutneyDebates Gilesyb such as currency manipulation to disadvantage competitors
Frances_Coppola	718090331615571968	2016-04-07T14:57:31	matango68 PeterPannier PutneyDebates Gilesyb indeed I would argue that large persistent imbalances indicate unfair trade practices
Frances_Coppola	718089976710356993	2016-04-07T14:56:06	matango68 PeterPannier PutneyDebates Gilesyb I know that. But free trade does not have to mean a large buildup of external debt.
Frances_Coppola	718088309667414016	2016-04-07T14:49:29	matango68 PeterPannier PutneyDebates Gilesyb no-one said anything about external debt

Frances_Coppola	718086770718609408	2016-04-07T14:43:22	PeterPannier matango68 PutneyDebates Gilesyb I don't disagree, but that's not a reason to give in to protectionist forces.
Frances_Coppola	718086249286934528	2016-04-07T14:41:17	matango68 PeterPannier PutneyDebates Gilesyb it is unfairly regulated trade. Call it by its proper name, please.
Frances_Coppola	718086039601020928	2016-04-07T14:40:27	matango68 PeterPannier PutneyDebates Gilesyb rubbish. Dominance by one set of rules is in no sense "free trade".
Frances_Coppola	718084443454500864	2016-04-07T14:34:07	matango68 PeterPannier PutneyDebates Gilesyb which is also what I said earlier in this convo (to which you are very late)
Frances_Coppola	718084362353446912	2016-04-07T14:33:48	matango68 PeterPannier PutneyDebates Gilesyb his point is that free trade should not mean dominance by one set of rules.
Frances_Coppola	718084102507855872	2016-04-07T14:32:46	matango68 PeterPannier PutneyDebates Gilesyb in that piece Stiglitz acknowledges that lowering tariff barriers is a good thing
Frances_Coppola	718083931220942848	2016-04-07T14:32:05	PeterPannier matango68 PutneyDebates Gilesyb but what is often called "free trade" is actually rich world protectionism in disguise.
Frances_Coppola	718083806448758784	2016-04-07T14:31:35	PeterPannier matango68 PutneyDebates Gilesyb what we want is free-er trade. Trade barriers impoverish people.

Frances_Coppola	718081312251359233	2016-04-07T14:21:40	matango68 PeterPannier PutneyDebates Gilesyb What you describe is not free trade.
Frances_Coppola	718077578419040256	2016-04-07T14:06:50	PeterPannier PutneyDebates Gilesyb I don't think real increases in incomes of many people in developing countries are "abstract theory"
Frances_Coppola	718074269167656961	2016-04-07T13:53:41	PeterPannier PutneyDebates Gilesyb trying to do so actually undermines trade relationships. People have short memories.
Frances_Coppola	718074076179349505	2016-04-07T13:52:55	PeterPannier PutneyDebates Gilesyb I don't think you can use unfair practices to compensate for the effects of past unfair practices.

Frances_Coppola	718055426538004480	2016-04-07T12:38:49	wdednam PutneyDebates Gilesyb that is very evident from the paper that you provided.
Frances_Coppola	718055342152761344	2016-04-07T12:38:29	wdednam PutneyDebates Gilesyb We have never had maximalist "free trade". But freer trade in 2000-2010 massively raised living stds.
Frances_Coppola	718055151282614272	2016-04-07T12:37:43	wdednam PutneyDebates Gilesyb What do you consider "free trade fetishism"?
Frances_Coppola	718055003479490560	2016-04-07T12:37:08	wdednam PutneyDebates Gilesyb In fact your paper blames the 80-00 slowdown on contractionary fiscal &amp; monetary policies, not free trade.
Frances_Coppola	718054409025036288	2016-04-07T12:34:46	wdednam PutneyDebates Gilesyb And then again it might not. You don't know.
Frances_Coppola	718054325843529728	2016-04-07T12:34:26	wdednam PutneyDebates Gilesyb You can't prove that.
Frances_Coppola	718054035216056320	2016-04-07T12:33:17	wdednam PutneyDebates Gilesyb Doesn't show that at all. Many other factors to consider.
Frances_Coppola	718053024174891009	2016-04-07T12:29:16	wdednam PutneyDebates Gilesyb The paper includes 2000-2010. You excluded it. Why?
Frances_Coppola	718052540605181952	2016-04-07T12:27:21	wdednam PutneyDebates Gilesyb Indeed it does. But you choose to ignore that period. Why?
Frances_Coppola	718052409885466624	2016-04-07T12:26:49	wdednam PutneyDebates Gilesyb Indeed. And those have also improved the most from 2000-2010 - which you completely ignore.
Frances_Coppola	718051972214038528	2016-04-07T12:25:05	wdednam PutneyDebates Gilesyb why do you pick the bits of your paper that support your view and ignore the rest?

Frances_Coppola	718051519568936961	2016-04-07T12:23:17	wdednam PutneyDebates Gilesyb the evidence is that people's INCOMES have risen. And that matters much more than "growth".
Frances_Coppola	718051203884662788	2016-04-07T12:22:02	PutneyDebates Gilesyb I can't say I blame them.
Frances_Coppola	718051129347739648	2016-04-07T12:21:44	wdednam PutneyDebates Gilesyb fact is that incomes in most developing countries have risen enormously due to trade. This is a good thing.

Frances_Coppola	718050503750459392	2016-04-07T12:19:15	PutneyDebates Gilesyb Fair play is only possible when the playground is supervised. But who would supervise?

Frances_Coppola	718048246510264321	2016-04-07T12:10:17	PutneyDebates Gilesyb We should campaign for genuinely free trade. So developed countries can compete equally with developed ones.
Frances_Coppola	718048118575665152	2016-04-07T12:09:46	PutneyDebates Gilesyb If it is actually a set of unfair rules it is NOT free trade. It is regulated trade. Unfairly regulated.
Frances_Coppola	718047263579324416	2016-04-07T12:06:22	PutneyDebates Gilesyb Good!

Frances_Coppola	717322970973224960	2016-04-05T12:08:18	CN_ DavidKeo I discuss inflation only in conjunction with growth and productivity, not as a standalone indicator.
Frances_Coppola	717322769235574784	2016-04-05T12:07:30	CN_ DavidKeo in fact in the piece I suggest that the principal indicator of deficient demand is low and declining interest rates.
Frances_Coppola	717322298311704576	2016-04-05T12:05:37	CN_ DavidKeo but I am still treating the problem as low demand, not low inflation. Inflation is a symptom not a cause.
Frances_Coppola	717322074373623808	2016-04-05T12:04:44	CN_ DavidKeo yes, if demand is deficient that is exactly what needs to happen

Frances_Coppola	717317149702885376	2016-04-05T11:45:10	CN_ DavidKeo I repeat, I am not talking about inflation. Though the low inflation in the Eurozone is not just from energy price falls.
Frances_Coppola	717316189412859905	2016-04-05T11:41:21	CN_ DavidKeo but of course that statement is simply a statement of fact, not a policy prescription.

Frances_Coppola	715232247692070914	2016-03-30T17:40:30	BarryNewall nonono. Low rates support debtors, not rentiers. Rentiers want higher rates so they don't have to draw down capital.

Frances_Coppola	715202659016433665	2016-03-30T15:42:56	iwasid PutneyDebates PickardJE Because it was corrupt and over-leveraged. Exactly like the private sector.
Frances_Coppola	715201103781085185	2016-03-30T15:36:45	iwasid tradercoach PutneyDebates PickardJE We will have to agree to differ, then. But seriously, nationalisation is NOT a solution.
Frances_Coppola	715200959048257536	2016-03-30T15:36:11	iwasid PutneyDebates PickardJE. They do. Biggest bank bailout was German public banks.
Frances_Coppola	715200668789829633	2016-03-30T15:35:01	iwasid PutneyDebates PickardJE I would not have nationalised Northern Rock, for example. Or Bradford &amp; Bingley.

Frances_Coppola	715198993073049601	2016-03-30T15:28:22	iwasid PutneyDebates PickardJE most of the problems in e.g. Germany were to do with PUBLIC sector lending.
Frances_Coppola	715198852916240385	2016-03-30T15:27:48	iwasid PutneyDebates PickardJE no they weren't
Frances_Coppola	715198652487180289	2016-03-30T15:27:01	iwasid PutneyDebates PickardJE the systemic failure was as much in the public as the private sector
Frances_Coppola	715198511130783745	2016-03-30T15:26:27	iwasid tradercoach PutneyDebates PickardJE that is dangerous nonsense.
Frances_Coppola	715198107101884416	2016-03-30T15:24:51	iwasid PutneyDebates PickardJE I'm afraid that is demonstrably untrue. Public sector banks did not continue lending after fin crisis.
Frances_Coppola	715197864771788801	2016-03-30T15:23:53	iwasid PutneyDebates PickardJE No, large numbers of Continental public sector banks failed in the systemic crisis of 2007-8.
Frances_Coppola	715197689240150016	2016-03-30T15:23:11	andrew_lilico yes,but think it through. Persistent deficit run by h/hold sector in relation to all other sectors implies higher h/hold debt
Frances_Coppola	715197313384333312	2016-03-30T15:21:41	ari1601 It may do, if the household and/or corporate sector refuse to take it on.
Frances_Coppola	715197093082701824	2016-03-30T15:20:49	andrew_lilico exactly.
Frances_Coppola	715197018428338176	2016-03-30T15:20:31	iwasid PutneyDebates PickardJE not necessarily. Suggest you look at the Continental bank failures. Lots were public sector.
Frances_Coppola	715196898689347584	2016-03-30T15:20:03	andrew_lilico Andrew that must be untrue by definition.
Frances_Coppola	715196772096692224	2016-03-30T15:19:32	andrew_lilico that does not matter. A debt is a debt. Whether to private or public agent is irrelevant in this context.
Frances_Coppola	715196325365686273	2016-03-30T15:17:46	andrew_lilico debt service cost/income is more meaningful.
Frances_Coppola	715196243887128578	2016-03-30T15:17:26	andrew_lilico Household debt is accumulated household deficits. Ratio of debt/income is stock/flow mix, which is confusing
Frances_Coppola	715195882837315585	2016-03-30T15:16:00	andrew_lilico no. Household deficit concerns household sector versus corporate and external sectors too, not just government.
Frances_Coppola	715195225812180993	2016-03-30T15:13:24	andrew_lilico see previous tweet.
Frances_Coppola	715194903031115777	2016-03-30T15:12:07	resi_analyst yes, of course it is. No joined-up thinking at all.
Frances_Coppola	715194773775233024	2016-03-30T15:11:36	andrew_lilico I included the comment about falling disposable income for a reason, Andrew.
Frances_Coppola	715194550491484160	2016-03-30T15:10:43	So here's the solution. RATES ON THE FLOOR FOREVER. There's a gentle hockey stick, but we don't believe that, do we? 
Frances_Coppola	715193692089368576	2016-03-30T15:07:18	But fiscal deficit can only be closed if household sector runs a large deficit, implying higher debt/income. 
Frances_Coppola	715193200722460675	2016-03-30T15:05:21	Household disposable income adjusted downwards, household debt/income adjusted upwards. Spot the problem. 
Frances_Coppola	715192676593889280	2016-03-30T15:03:16	Shireblogger I can't.
Frances_Coppola	715189789461504001	2016-03-30T14:51:48	andrew_lilico Yep. Preferably corporate.
Frances_Coppola	715189094826029057	2016-03-30T14:49:02	andrew_lilico I don't think there is an "ideal". But I'd like to see smaller foreign surplus and smaller household deficit.
Frances_Coppola	715188387033063424	2016-03-30T14:46:13	ari1601 they assume perfect monetary offset, I suspect. Rates to stay low for longer...
Frances_Coppola	715188165770928128	2016-03-30T14:45:20	Can someone please explain why running a persistent household deficit of 3.5% of GDP is "sound economic management"? 
Frances_Coppola	715187774735917056	2016-03-30T14:43:47	Shireblogger these are only a sample. The best ones are inflation forecasts. 2% inflation will return ANY DAY NOW.....
Frances_Coppola	715187559723319296	2016-03-30T14:42:56	Shireblogger indeed. But reading the OBR report doesn't inspire confidence. I've never seen so many hockey-stick assumptions.

Frances_Coppola	715186932691537922	2016-03-30T14:40:26	billwells_1 yes, it's a residual
Frances_Coppola	715184827260137472	2016-03-30T14:32:04	More hockey-stick price assumptions from the OBR. Oil price, this time. 
Frances_Coppola	715183996125188097	2016-03-30T14:28:46	DannyAxford worse, actually - I've just tweeted the comparison
Frances_Coppola	715183887069093891	2016-03-30T14:28:20	Though the US's CBO is even worse at forecasting than the OBR, it seems. Particularly output. 
Frances_Coppola	715182700018212865	2016-03-30T14:23:37	Phuckle_IRE about right...
Frances_Coppola	715182566412828673	2016-03-30T14:23:05	In fact, why do we take OBR forecasts seriously at all? Or Bank of England ones, for that matter? 
Frances_Coppola	715182070209847296	2016-03-30T14:21:07	billwells_1 ah yes, the Goodhart and Nangle thesis.
Frances_Coppola	715181307148558336	2016-03-30T14:18:05	More in the "can someone explain" series. Bond yields, this time. Why is this trend reversal forecast realistic?
