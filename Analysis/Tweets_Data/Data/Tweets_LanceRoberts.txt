LanceRoberts	692193762026590208	2016-01-27T03:53:47	RPSeawright Cimmerian999 To win the long game, you can't spend the bulk of your time making up previous losses. Manage risk, gains come.
LanceRoberts	692193549501218820	2016-01-27T03:52:57	RPSeawright Cimmerian999 NO...Not market timing. Can't be done effectively over time. Managing risk is NOT market timing.
LanceRoberts	692192157600518145	2016-01-27T03:47:25	RPSeawright I publish a real time risk management model every week in my newsletter to help people with 401k plans.
LanceRoberts	692191933121347585	2016-01-27T03:46:31	RPSeawright When markets return to bullish trend, I don't have to TIME an entry, just start adding back exposure.
LanceRoberts	692191601335111680	2016-01-27T03:45:12	RPSeawright That happens. But gain, you are suggesting market timing. I NEVER endorse being all out of the market. Just reduce risk.
LanceRoberts	692191254487158784	2016-01-27T03:43:50	RPSeawright AH..now that is the right question. If you are talking about beating a random benchmark EVERY year...no. But, long term, yes.
LanceRoberts	692190909006503937	2016-01-27T03:42:27	RPSeawright Ray Dalio, Clifford Asness, etc. There are many that do.
LanceRoberts	692190350555942917	2016-01-27T03:40:14	RPSeawright Yes, and I wrote many missives about the coming bear market in 1999. Same in 2007. No one believed me then either.
LanceRoberts	692190055436292098	2016-01-27T03:39:04	RPSeawright The problem is solving the crossroad between long term investment discipline and investor psychology.
LanceRoberts	692189895377469440	2016-01-27T03:38:25	RPSeawright Reality is, despite the best of intentions, individuals bail out of investments at worst times when losses mount enough.
LanceRoberts	692189722421125120	2016-01-27T03:37:44	RPSeawright I am simply discussing the importance of managing your portfolio rather than just ride things up and down hoping they turn out.
LanceRoberts	692189531039219715	2016-01-27T03:36:59	RPSeawright For example. You wouldn't own high yield or oil now. The signs were obvious 14 months ago to leave.
LanceRoberts	692189050413957121	2016-01-27T03:35:04	RPSeawright I thought I was the only one working late. :-)  Let's make sure we are talking the same language - not market timing. Just mgmt
LanceRoberts	692187287925477376	2016-01-27T03:28:04	RPSeawright Wayne Gretzky summed up money management - "I don't skate where the puck was, but where its going to be."
LanceRoberts	692187097990565888	2016-01-27T03:27:19	RPSeawright In times where risk of loss outweighs potential for reward. Overweight fixed income and cash can protect gains.
LanceRoberts	692186696083988481	2016-01-27T03:25:43	RPSeawright By tactical mgmt I assume you mean "market timing." You are correct. But good risk management has long track record of success.
LanceRoberts	692067096092487680	2016-01-26T19:30:28	Market has a strong track record of predicting recession. Economic data not so much.  
LanceRoberts	692059629010837504	2016-01-26T19:00:48	"Stock market has predicted 11 of last 5 recession." Actually not true.

LanceRoberts	691666960208125952	2016-01-25T17:00:28	The problem with long-term "buy and hold" is it depends on WHEN you start investing.
