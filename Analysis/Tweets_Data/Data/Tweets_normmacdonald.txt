normmacdonald	723709543742476288	2016-04-23T03:06:15	Tonight The Islanders and Florida are 5 minutes into its 1st OT but I have another prediction. I call a tie after first OT. Just watch.
normmacdonald	723709032192610305	2016-04-23T03:04:13	The most exciting time in professional sport is sudden death in hockey. Last night we saw a double OT.
normmacdonald	723389174821216256	2016-04-22T05:53:13	Hopefully, Steph never has to leave the bench, which would be my wager.
normmacdonald	723389023792693248	2016-04-22T05:52:37	In the final 4 minutes, only play him if you are down by 3.
normmacdonald	723388917051854848	2016-04-22T05:52:12	In the 4th quarter, do not play him in the first 4 minutes until down by 6, the second 4 minutes until down by 4.
normmacdonald	723388641402179585	2016-04-22T05:51:06	In the third quarter do not play him until you are down by 6.
normmacdonald	723388448933969920	2016-04-22T05:50:20	My suggestion. Have him dressed and don't play him until they get behind by double-digits in the first half.
normmacdonald	723388182578896896	2016-04-22T05:49:17	It leaves an interesting question. What do with Steph?
normmacdonald	723388072470048769	2016-04-22T05:48:51	Now, Houston was down by 1 and had no timeouts left. Harden ran the floor and scored with 2.7 seconds left.GS could not answer and lost.
normmacdonald	723385238953447424	2016-04-22T05:37:35	The inbound passer had trouble, but could not call a timeout and threw in a jump-ball which GS grabbed, took off downcourt and scored.
normmacdonald	723384476093407232	2016-04-22T05:34:33	The ball went out of bounds but off a Warrior and Houston had the possession, with no timeouts left and up 1.
normmacdonald	723384237924044801	2016-04-22T05:33:36	Then the Warriors missed and Houston had the ball with 26 seconds left. Strangely, GS decided not to foul.
normmacdonald	723384022362017792	2016-04-22T05:32:45	Then Houston took it right back, up 1.
normmacdonald	723383590889746433	2016-04-22T05:31:02	The Warriors, up 2-0 but playing without the services of Steph Curry, led 2-0, lost the lead and didn't retake it until a minute left.
normmacdonald	723383165146918912	2016-04-22T05:29:21	Earlier tonight, in roundball, there was a barn-burner in Houston.
normmacdonald	723383008464494592	2016-04-22T05:28:43	That is Kane's 5th playoff OT goal. Chicago defends and will head back to the United Center to try to defend their Cup.
normmacdonald	723382485279625216	2016-04-22T05:26:38	KANE SCORES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
normmacdonald	723382084555825154	2016-04-22T05:25:03	The Blues use a timeout with 17 minutes left. Don't think I've ever seen that.
normmacdonald	723381764400390144	2016-04-22T05:23:47	An uneventful first overtime is in the books, and so is the 4th intermission. Let's watch.
normmacdonald	723381420178067456	2016-04-22T05:22:25	In a bungled shift change they were caught with too many men on the ice and a two minute penalty led to St. Louis tying it late.
normmacdonald	723381164757553158	2016-04-22T05:21:24	The defending champs still led and then, with 4 minutes remaining in regulation, they did the unthinkable.
normmacdonald	723380974931709952	2016-04-22T05:20:38	St. Louis scored in the third to get to within one.
normmacdonald	723380833411702784	2016-04-22T05:20:05	This was big for the Hawks, who are down 3-1 in the series.
normmacdonald	723380666943987712	2016-04-22T05:19:25	The game was tied 1-1, and then late in the second period, Chicago scored two, to lead 3-1.
normmacdonald	723380480490373120	2016-04-22T05:18:40	How did they get there?
normmacdonald	723380437129646082	2016-04-22T05:18:30	There is nothing more exciting in sports than extra time in hockey. Chicago and St. Louis is about to begin their second overtime.
normmacdonald	723373864487546882	2016-04-22T04:52:23	Here's a pic of Prince that I took a year ago when he jumped on stage at SNL's 40th anniversary.  A true Legend! 
normmacdonald	723066670332272641	2016-04-21T08:31:42	Signing off.
normmacdonald	723066633938300928	2016-04-21T08:31:34	You go there, too. We'll all be there.
normmacdonald	723066503449305088	2016-04-21T08:31:03	I'm going away now, into Merle's mighty music. It'll be just fine.
normmacdonald	723064214751834112	2016-04-21T08:21:57	Miss Merle.
normmacdonald	723064161765232640	2016-04-21T08:21:44	Miss him.
normmacdonald	723064117737574400	2016-04-21T08:21:34	But now he's gone and a lot of us miss him way more than we would ever have thought.
normmacdonald	723063951521501184	2016-04-21T08:20:54	It seemed he had always been there and always would.
normmacdonald	723063848639451138	2016-04-21T08:20:30	He worked till the end.
normmacdonald	723063795359195136	2016-04-21T08:20:17	Merle hadn't been himself for quite a while but his voice was still as mighty as ever.
normmacdonald	723054949140066304	2016-04-21T07:45:08	InsideLegendDot  not me,

normmacdonald	719255181712617472	2016-04-10T20:06:13	normmacdonald he'll win.
normmacdonald	720693382490759168	2016-04-14T19:21:06	Check out me and Nealon at the tbca.  Tkts  
normmacdonald	719725653881278464	2016-04-12T03:15:42	SteveMartinToGo Foremost a painter, Morse invented the telegraph because he was notified too late of his wife's fatal illness.
normmacdonald	719721011709485056	2016-04-12T02:57:15	SteveMartinToGo Same could be said for "As You Like It"
normmacdonald	719281338742755328	2016-04-10T21:50:09	Westwood with an incredible shot gets to -3 and is one behind.
normmacdonald	719280079625322496	2016-04-10T21:45:09	Speech melts down. The first was a mistake. The next two were mental.
normmacdonald	719279688695197696	2016-04-10T21:43:36	And there he goes.
normmacdonald	719259644414136320	2016-04-10T20:23:57	Speech sticks it and is it too far now?
normmacdonald	719258992912896000	2016-04-10T20:21:21	Speech must back up if he is to be caught. I still believe he will be.
normmacdonald	719258515743748096	2016-04-10T20:19:27	Day birdies 8 and gets back to even.
normmacdonald	719258378459959296	2016-04-10T20:18:55	DJ nearly has an albatross at 8 but it hit the pin, came back 8 feet and he missed and settled for birdie.
normmacdonald	719255957520277504	2016-04-10T20:09:18	normmacdonald guess that's why Spith is leading and be hard to catch.
normmacdonald	719257345394479105	2016-04-10T20:14:48	Speech birdies 6. Every time anyone gets near he hits a birdie. Back to -4. 2 ahed of Willet.
normmacdonald	719255707795611648	2016-04-10T20:08:18	Willet, at 8, gets to -2.
normmacdonald	719254795198988289	2016-04-10T20:04:40	So now the lead is 2 for Speith and he will not win it. he will be caught.
normmacdonald	719254616085389313	2016-04-10T20:03:58	Smile pars.
normmacdonald	719254528780939264	2016-04-10T20:03:37	Speech bogies.
normmacdonald	719254162005831680	2016-04-10T20:02:09	Day tried to get even but just missed. +1.
normmacdonald	719253876797341696	2016-04-10T20:01:01	So far, it's been easy for Speith. He hs a tough shot on the 5th though. But his scrambling has been incredible through hi first 4.
normmacdonald	719252729848209408	2016-04-10T19:56:28	Speech is 14 holes away now from his second straight green jacket. He leads by 3.
normmacdonald	719250878167814144	2016-04-10T19:49:07	Smile drops one. so much for the swing.
normmacdonald	719250685649227776	2016-04-10T19:48:21	And a huge par save. and he has -4 and a hammerlock on the Masters.
normmacdonald	719250422196609024	2016-04-10T19:47:18	Speech for par.
normmacdonald	719249966250610688	2016-04-10T19:45:29	Speech's ball kicked out of that deep trouble so forget about any swing.
normmacdonald	719249086281437184	2016-04-10T19:41:59	there may be a big swing in the ultimate game. We'll wait and see.
normmacdonald	719243439766777856	2016-04-10T19:19:33	Soren birdies and gets red, -1.
normmacdonald	719243344786755584	2016-04-10T19:19:10	Day with a long birdie putt and lags it in close.
normmacdonald	719243065139941376	2016-04-10T19:18:04	Smile and Sieth birdie so they are -4 and -3. Will this become match play. Ithaca become a legitimate question.
normmacdonald	719241539373805568	2016-04-10T19:12:00	Smile sticks his 3rd on the par 5. Speith is on in 2.
normmacdonald	719241069838209024	2016-04-10T19:10:08	DJ misses a short birdie putt and remains even.
normmacdonald	719240876887683072	2016-04-10T19:09:22	Matsuyama birdies. 3 in red now.
normmacdonald	719240719160860673	2016-04-10T19:08:44	Day misses his birdie putt as well.
normmacdonald	719240632716304384	2016-04-10T19:08:24	Langer misses the birdie putt.
normmacdonald	719239894594260993	2016-04-10T19:05:28	Still very cool. They tape every par 3, with every player.
normmacdonald	719239522819706881	2016-04-10T19:03:59	normmacdonald first viewed hole in one! but not seen live.
normmacdonald	719239605166342144	2016-04-10T19:04:19	Langer hits a fine 3rd on the 2nd and will be looking at a birdie putt to get it back to red figures.
normmacdonald	719239118501187584	2016-04-10T19:02:23	On the par 5 2nd, Smylie finds a bunker and Spieth hits it dead straight.
normmacdonald	719238635858440192	2016-04-10T19:00:28	DJ pulls out the driver and sees if he can drive the par 4 3rd as Rory di. And he smashes it right through the green.
normmacdonald	719238048676851713	2016-04-10T18:58:08	At the first, Spieth two-putts for par and Smylie hits the 3 footer too hard and it lips out. So two pars and a giant opportunity missed.
normmacdonald	719237526062403584	2016-04-10T18:56:03	Rory, from deep in the woods, hits a shot reminiscent of Tiger, but then misses the par putt.
normmacdonald	719237232750567425	2016-04-10T18:54:53	Up ahead at 2, Jason and DJ par and stay even.
normmacdonald	719236825127124993	2016-04-10T18:53:16	And he sticks it. He will open day 3 with a birdie. Watch out for this kid. He may not make it close.
normmacdonald	719236585443602432	2016-04-10T18:52:19	Spite easily makes the green and will have a shot at birdie. And now Smylie.
normmacdonald	719236338516496384	2016-04-10T18:51:20	Yes, Fred, by a decade.
normmacdonald	719235705000587264	2016-04-10T18:48:49	normmacdonald Smauley Kaufman looks like a good looking version of a kid on Malcolm in The Middle. Would Langer be oldest to win this?
normmacdonald	719236123931709440	2016-04-10T18:50:29	And he also misses and falls to even. Only 2 in red figures now. Smile and Spieth.
normmacdonald	719235937679478784	2016-04-10T18:49:44	Keldsen birdies 3 with a great 25 footer and gets to even. Langer could not get the up and down and he falls to even. And now Matsuayma.
normmacdonald	719235460229300224	2016-04-10T18:47:51	And now, the wild card, Smylie Kaufman. I could see him walking away with this thing. Incredible poise. But both he and Jordan hit it right.
normmacdonald	719234379118026752	2016-04-10T18:43:33	Matsuyama with an awful shot that goes right and both these players will have trouble saving par.
normmacdonald	719234111336886272	2016-04-10T18:42:29	Longer attacks the green and it flies over it and and he will need to make a tough up and down to save par.
normmacdonald	719233880671170561	2016-04-10T18:41:34	There are 4 in the red and the penultimate game has just teed off, Matsuyama and Langer.
normmacdonald	719233403103481856	2016-04-10T18:39:40	DJ and Day two putt for pars.
normmacdonald	719233084663529472	2016-04-10T18:38:24	Still waiting for Fred Stoller or Tim Bader to weigh in.
normmacdonald	719232427047059456	2016-04-10T18:35:47	Rory just misses the eagle and now will tap in to break his long drought of no birdies.
normmacdonald	719231474931601408	2016-04-10T18:32:00	Day flies it well by. No chance at birdie. DJ hits it the exact same spot.
normmacdonald	719231215924936704	2016-04-10T18:30:59	I have never seen this. Rory has just found the green at the par 4 3rd and has an eagle opportunity.
normmacdonald	719231037780328448	2016-04-10T18:30:16	Westwood falls to +2 after missing a short putt on the first. Disappointing start. Rory saves par. Pulls out his driver and magnificence.
normmacdonald	719230070762516482	2016-04-10T18:26:26	I made the best album of the year. Buy it or fuck you. RT if you agree.
normmacdonald	719230335238561793	2016-04-10T18:27:29	Day, the presumptive winner, hammers it through the fairway into the second rough and DJ smashes it perfectly. Watch this twosome.
normmacdonald	719229935487815681	2016-04-10T18:25:53	I'm not seeing either Fred Stoller or Bader chiming in. Fred, you have to follow me for me to see you.
normmacdonald	719229439435866113	2016-04-10T18:23:55	Rory has a tricky downhiller on the par 5 second to save par. incredible.
normmacdonald	719228765939695616	2016-04-10T18:21:15	Lets not forget Sneaker who could win this thing with his blade. Spite had his worst day with his putter yesterday.
normmacdonald	719228538646192128	2016-04-10T18:20:20	Oosthuizen pars the first two and birdies number 3.
normmacdonald	719228427635568642	2016-04-10T18:19:54	The first two holes have been very easy but Rory bogies number one, and will not par the second. Quickly knocking himself out of the tourney
normmacdonald	719228041524711424	2016-04-10T18:18:22	And with the conditions so perfect today it really favors Dustin Johnson and Matsuyama with the par 5s. Expect eagles today.
normmacdonald	719227669229899776	2016-04-10T18:16:53	Hard not to root for Smylie as well.
normmacdonald	719227581053046784	2016-04-10T18:16:32	The least likely player to win today is Speith. The most likely is Jason Day. But there are plenty in the mix. Hard not to root for Langer.
normmacdonald	719227322809749504	2016-04-10T18:15:31	That will not happen Raymond.
normmacdonald	719227169390665728	2016-04-10T18:14:54	Jordan Spieth will repeat as Masters champion, with Watson coming in second by 2 strokes. Rory, top 10. Langer, top 15. Unsure of Jason Day.
normmacdonald	719227147642994688	2016-04-10T18:14:49	Rory did not birdie all day yesterday so it is exceptional that he is not way out of it. However he bogies the simple first hole.
normmacdonald	719226669022621696	2016-04-10T18:12:55	CBS is not covering some great golf right now.
normmacdonald	719223464054292482	2016-04-10T18:00:11	normmacdonald What is the golf jargon for Saturday's round, is it placement day? Thanks
normmacdonald	719223090304016384	2016-04-10T17:58:41	Everyone should turn to CBS where they will show you Rory's first hole and pretend it is live.
normmacdonald	719222883562627072	2016-04-10T17:57:52	The early players today are scoring well, so the conditions should be favorable and it looks like it might take -6 or -7 to win. We will see
normmacdonald	719220982418776064	2016-04-10T17:50:19	Bader, if you follow me, it's easier.
normmacdonald	719220301662277632	2016-04-10T17:47:37	Yes, it's me, Bader and in 13 minutes the Masters coverage on CBS begins.
normmacdonald	719219633467752448	2016-04-10T17:44:57	normmacdonald is this really Norm?  bader.
normmacdonald	719218690567180289	2016-04-10T17:41:12	Rory at the first tee box.
normmacdonald	718537202662158336	2016-04-08T20:33:13	He has hit it in the pine straw. Will he end the day with the lead. I don't think so.
normmacdonald	718536993257316352	2016-04-08T20:32:23	And now Speith on the 13th tee.
normmacdonald	718536834754564096	2016-04-08T20:31:45	Kopek gats under par.
normmacdonald	718536521226190848	2016-04-08T20:30:31	Sorry, Rory sits 2 back.
normmacdonald	718536411415060480	2016-04-08T20:30:04	Jordan heads to the par 5 13th. Playing along with him the amateur, who is 2 back. In Butler Cabin Rory sits one back.
normmacdonald	718535556846604288	2016-04-08T20:26:41	This continues to look like by Sunday's end it may go down as the greatest Masters ever.
normmacdonald	718291263724908545	2016-04-08T04:15:57	Half-way through the third, GSW well ahead.

normmacdonald	713240514586288128	2016-03-25T05:46:04	It featured a cast, well-grounded, and Garry floated among them, an untethered balloon. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713240230065614848	2016-03-25T05:44:56	That fall, "It's Garry Handling's Show" premiered on Showtime. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713226841071333376	2016-03-25T04:51:44	And that day, the view they all witnessed was Garry Shandling driving into the distance at a measured pace. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713226526217482244	2016-03-25T04:50:29	The office was the best on the lot, and provided the best view, too. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713226363600109568	2016-03-25T04:49:50	Names were being thrown around the room as to who should be the wife, the neighbor, the best friend. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713225997676453888	2016-03-25T04:48:23	Five minutes into the meeting and the two sides were close to a deal and Gary's manager was thrilled. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713225632235126784	2016-03-25T04:46:56	Garry excused himself to the restroom leaving his management and the network to talk money. Gary disliked this part. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713225318048206848	2016-03-25T04:45:41	Garry's manager was happy. Sometimes Garry could be stubborn and was notorious for ignoring notes. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713225029832433664	2016-03-25T04:44:32	Garry agreed, said it was a great idea and that maybe he should have a kid too, to further ground him. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713224806812950528	2016-03-25T04:43:39	After the presentation the execs had only one suggestion. They thought Garry should be married. It would "ground" him. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713224510552432640	2016-03-25T04:42:29	But Showtime was not a name and Garry was so the bewildered suits sat and laughed when they thought they should. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713224306612764672	2016-03-25T04:41:40	So imagine trying to convince TV execs that this wild experiment would be good for their network. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713224050542153730	2016-03-25T04:40:39	Garry Shandling created the outside joke. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713223881616568320	2016-03-25T04:39:59	In essence Gary Shandling created a new type of comedy. Garry Shandling created something no one else has dared to try. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713223558109892608	2016-03-25T04:38:41	There was also an actual person named Garry who had a different audience, the audience watching television. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713223250759647232	2016-03-25T04:37:28	Garry seemed obsessed with letting us know there was a character named Gary who had a studio audience but.... RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713222859120771073	2016-03-25T04:35:55	The show looked like punk comedy at the highest level and it was, but it was more too. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713222519797391360	2016-03-25T04:34:34	And others watched the art that they would steal. But they were sloppy and they were timid. Not Shandling. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713221902097981440	2016-03-25T04:32:07	At the end he explained what we had all learned. But he did it without condescension or disdain. He was just playing. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713221616566534144	2016-03-25T04:30:59	He wandered from set to set. He spoke to the studio audience, the home audience. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713221318758391808	2016-03-25T04:29:48	So, after Garry completed his three dimensional multi-camera sitcom he tore it asunder, RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713221007075442688	2016-03-25T04:28:33	And so Shandling began by writing a straight-ahead sitcom script. And not a lame one, either. That would be too easy. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713220675381559296	2016-03-25T04:27:14	Shandling understood you couldn't create parody in a vacuum. You needed the target created beneath the arrow RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713220124178718723	2016-03-25T04:25:03	This was the key that so many to come who were "influenced" by Shandling failed to understand. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713219756254302208	2016-03-25T04:23:35	Then the cast would appear. The cast never broke character. Never. This was the key. RIPGarryShandling

normmacdonald	713219175062249472	2016-03-25T04:21:16	Then there would be the monologue which would explain the plot the audience was about to witness. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713218955465207809	2016-03-25T04:20:24	The theme song would be called "This is the Theme to Garry's Show" and the theme song was all about the theme song. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713218499556954113	2016-03-25T04:18:35	It would begin from the beginning of the show, Gary explained to the bewildered execs. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713218261949624320	2016-03-25T04:17:39	But Shandling wanted to go much further, having the rest of the cast play it dead straight while Garry wanted. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713217739809161217	2016-03-25T04:15:34	George would address the camera when Gracie wasn't in the room, playing to his strength as a stand-up. RIPGarryShandling

normmacdonald	713216917738131456	2016-03-25T04:12:18	Garry explained he would begin the show with a monologue which would set up the episode. RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713216653404672001	2016-03-25T04:11:15	He was pitching his show, It's Garry Shandling Show, which would be a hybrid, half sitcom half meta-sitcom RIPGarryShandling
normmacdonald	713216343001026560	2016-03-25T04:10:01	Garry was just a working comic so turning down the guest host job was one ballsy move.
normmacdonald	713216177644769281	2016-03-25T04:09:22	It was a meeting with the then unknown Showtime, at the beginning of cable.
normmacdonald	713216023042785280	2016-03-25T04:08:45	Best story I've heard about Garry is that after he turned down permanent guest host for The Tonight Show w. Johnny Carson, he took a meeting

normmacdonald	703064035999154177	2016-02-26T03:48:23	Rip was right, though. So-Slow wasn't going to ever be the leader. He was lucky to be in the gang at all, and only was cause of Swinemeat.

normmacdonald	696944315684286465	2016-02-09T06:30:48	Dosto is a fine writer. Better are Tolstoy, Chekhov, Gogol, Turgenev and Pushkin.

normmacdonald	696937515614388225	2016-02-09T06:03:46	normmacdonald Gotta gove some love to the Kreutzer Sonata. The story. Not the song
normmacdonald	696937302350831618	2016-02-09T06:02:56	I don't know how to do that.
normmacdonald	696932649533890560	2016-02-09T05:44:26	normmacdonald bring back the book club Norm
normmacdonald	696935836546420736	2016-02-09T05:57:06	Agree completely. Should read both actually. and P&amp;V have not translated most Tolstoy, so then go to Constance.
normmacdonald	696935261117272064	2016-02-09T05:54:49	normmacdonald P&amp;V are great. I really like the Garnett translations too - her prose can be antiquated, but it is also lovely
normmacdonald	696935376599040000	2016-02-09T05:55:16	normmacdonald Norm, you speak the truth. The Death of Ivan Ilyich is particularly fine. He never once wasted a word.
normmacdonald	696935441585590275	2016-02-09T05:55:32	Its not a task. Its a joy. Read it slowly. Savor.
normmacdonald	696933685183016964	2016-02-09T05:48:33	.ChiBDM normmacdonald  I'm assuming there are CliffsNotes to expedite this task?
normmacdonald	696934094496776192	2016-02-09T05:50:11	No, it is the fact that the male nurse overlooks how this picture will look for him and shows mercy and love to Ivan. Nothing else.
normmacdonald	696933626408255488	2016-02-09T05:48:19	normmacdonald but it is explicitly sexual. This comfort stems from more than kindness,but from a fulfillment of forbidden sexual desire?
normmacdonald	696932872289124352	2016-02-09T05:45:19	Good point. P&amp;V are by far the best. Of course, if possible, read it in the tongue it was written.
normmacdonald	696932212516720640	2016-02-09T05:42:42	And find *good* translations if you can't do Russian...the Pevear/Volokhonsky versions are the best English IMO 
normmacdonald	696932376048463873	2016-02-09T05:43:21	Dostoevsky was far the inferior to Tolstoy, he was inferior to most of the great Russians.
normmacdonald	696931816985464832	2016-02-09T05:41:08	normmacdonald Dostoevsky is better than Tolstoy, don't you think?  Crime and Punishment. Brothers Karamazov. And so many more...
normmacdonald	696931940906242048	2016-02-09T05:41:37	Well, Conor, it is not his servant but Ivan is comforted because this man does something people would find obscene out of kindness.
normmacdonald	696931232056287232	2016-02-09T05:38:48	normmacdonald why does Ivan ilyich find comfort in having his legs rest on his servants shoulders as he's dying ?
normmacdonald	696931043887214593	2016-02-09T05:38:03	Read, in chronological order if possible, everything Tolstoy has ever written.
normmacdonald	696930883551567873	2016-02-09T05:37:25	Tolstoy could write a massive book like War &amp; Peace and have very word be necessary.
normmacdonald	696930462170812416	2016-02-09T05:35:45	A great writer will speak to you in some manner. But Tolstoy was the only writer ever who could speak for you.
normmacdonald	696930281350176768	2016-02-09T05:35:02	A bad writer would be hard to understand a good writer would be easy to understand.
normmacdonald	696930032254636032	2016-02-09T05:34:02	To be a great writer you must be able to communicate with the reader. Tolstoy communicates better than anyone else ever.
normmacdonald	696929810677895169	2016-02-09T05:33:09	The opposite is true.
normmacdonald	696929719988707328	2016-02-09T05:32:48	People think Tolstoy would be too difficult to understand since he is the greatest writer to ever have drawn breath.
normmacdonald	696929519362514944	2016-02-09T05:32:00	Tolstoy is the best writer who has ever lived. Some people are intimidated by that fact.
normmacdonald	696927606176874496	2016-02-09T05:24:24	Since I am asked about Tolstoy I will suggest all read him. Read all he has written. Here's the thing about Tolstoy.
normmacdonald	696925324332892160	2016-02-09T05:15:20	normmacdonald D'ya mind spouting a bit about why his writing is so insightful,  profound, and useful?
normmacdonald	696923641095856128	2016-02-09T05:08:38	normmacdonald your SNL news was the best as well as your ending interpretation of Breaking Bad, which I will believe in until the day I die
normmacdonald	696923745953382400	2016-02-09T05:09:03	RaymondKattoula normmacdonald Agreed. Norm and Letterman are my top 2
normmacdonald	696924195196923904	2016-02-09T05:10:51	normmacdonald I sat next to some guys girlfriend at your Detroit show and she plugged her ears, I laughed my ass off for 3 hours
normmacdonald	696924234245918720	2016-02-09T05:11:00	RaymondKattoula normmacdonald, BrianReganComic, and JimGaffigan are three best alive, in my opinion. And 2 have played the Colonel!

normmacdonald	696912600894824448	2016-02-09T04:24:46	normmacdonald I think of that story sometimes. Felt biblical and true.
normmacdonald	696911959849963520	2016-02-09T04:22:13	normmacdonald Thank you, Norm. Maybe 1 day you will go back to story of Roman who went wolf hunting. Or maybe it is best left unrevealed.
normmacdonald	696913137853812736	2016-02-09T04:26:54	normmacdonald "...once. Once and for all. For all." Joycean, I like this 👌🏽
normmacdonald	696913934297669632	2016-02-09T04:30:04	normmacdonald The past isn't going anywhere. Safe travels and happy adventures, Norm!
normmacdonald	696915696127574016	2016-02-09T04:37:04	normmacdonald Enjoy it Norm! Life is good.
normmacdonald	696916009534369794	2016-02-09T04:38:19	normmacdonald yes, tomorrow. Seattle. I'll be there.
normmacdonald	696919395717771264	2016-02-09T04:51:46	Berzirk normmacdonald I'm 24 and Norm is among the top 5 greatest comedians alive if that means anything. :(
normmacdonald	696850643525324801	2016-02-09T00:18:34	normmacdonald Tried 2 explain how you transcend comedy to a couple of 20-somethings.Their entire world view is reddit,memes &amp; useless shit.
normmacdonald	696911825326071808	2016-02-09T04:21:41	The adventure is Sandler's but he has invited a few friends to tag along. The flight is at noon sharp. First stop: Seattle.
normmacdonald	696911353882083331	2016-02-09T04:19:49	But, for now, as so often, the past must wait so the present and future can be told. Tomorrow, the adventure begins.
normmacdonald	696910885659389952	2016-02-09T04:17:57	But these are things that were and will be revisited and the awful secret of Swinemeat will be revealed in time.
normmacdonald	696829077341077504	2016-02-08T22:52:53	Swinemeat hobbled to the car and I was red with anger and let the knife sink into the soil. Wasn't the same, though. Time. Just Time.
normmacdonald	696826655495487488	2016-02-08T22:43:15	For the sake of So-Slow.
normmacdonald	696826576491511808	2016-02-08T22:42:56	I would have, too, and they would have found him dead in a bone orchard, only one unburied, but I didn't. For the sake of So-Slow.
normmacdonald	696826320391569409	2016-02-08T22:41:55	Swinemeat snorted again and slapped my chest with the back of his hand. I wanted with all my should to slide my knife into him.
normmacdonald	696825965003956225	2016-02-08T22:40:31	"After this whole thing goes down, Meat, you and I will settle this business that is so old and so ugly, once. Once and for all. For all."
normmacdonald	696825567157493760	2016-02-08T22:38:56	Swine meat just snorted his version at me, with his head held high an proud. Snorted. At me.
normmacdonald	696820082488442880	2016-02-08T22:17:08	"He's a stupid sonofabitch, aint he Norm?""He's in a state of grief and after what we do he'll be in a state of grace, that's what matters."
normmacdonald	696819104343158785	2016-02-08T22:13:15	And there he'd be, knelt in repose, before the grave of his only child.
normmacdonald	696818786926596097	2016-02-08T22:11:59	If you couldn't find So-Slow, you would head down to the ancient Anglican Church on Bellflower road and go behind it.
normmacdonald	696818223698698240	2016-02-08T22:09:45	He said the reason he didn't was to show it was an accident. "The truth has to be known about Sampson", he said. Made sense.
normmacdonald	696817974632534016	2016-02-08T22:08:46	At the time I asked So-Slow if he had thought about turning the gun on himself afterward, like we all thought he had.
normmacdonald	696817603675713536	2016-02-08T22:07:17	It seemed to me that that day that So-Slow shot dead the jackrabbit that turned out to be his young son had broke him.
normmacdonald	696817107443404800	2016-02-08T22:05:19	But we couldn't do it without him.
normmacdonald	696817007652569089	2016-02-08T22:04:55	If we were going to do this thing, we had to do it right. Make no mistakes. And if So-Slow screwed it up, it was all our hides.
normmacdonald	696815972754173953	2016-02-08T22:00:48	Yes, this is a true story that happened and I was there.
normmacdonald	696814143551082496	2016-02-08T21:53:32	I was the only one of the three of us that had never done time. And I was the guiltiest man by far.
normmacdonald	696813936293728256	2016-02-08T21:52:43	"When I say we do it is when we do it", that was me talking.
normmacdonald	696813405152260096	2016-02-08T21:50:36	"We gonna do this thing or not?", that was Swinemeat talking.
normmacdonald	696812736630509568	2016-02-08T21:47:57	Maybe it was my weak character. Haha.
normmacdonald	696812145619546112	2016-02-08T21:45:36	Sometimes I wondered how I'd found myself in the company of to men, the likes of So-Slow and Swinemeat.
normmacdonald	696811692542418946	2016-02-08T21:43:48	So-Slow was very good at hitting. You don't believe me, ask Swinemeat. Or just look at his left ear.
normmacdonald	696811043616522241	2016-02-08T21:41:13	When I was telling him I got worried that he might hit me. So-Slow was good at hitting.
normmacdonald	696810915228839937	2016-02-08T21:40:42	Now, a lot of people got real mad that I talked to So-Slow like that.
normmacdonald	696810797389885440	2016-02-08T21:40:14	And I told So-Slow that his condition was based upon all the little decisions he'd made, which was a reslt of his weak character.
normmacdonald	696810560445284353	2016-02-08T21:39:18	I told So-Slow his character was weak, and that caused every decision he made to be weak.
normmacdonald	696810434389606400	2016-02-08T21:38:48	I told So-Slow that these decisions were not accidental but built upon a foundation and the foundation was what is known as character.
normmacdonald	696810196920709120	2016-02-08T21:37:51	I told him that a man's condition was a direct result of the million tiny decisions he makes day after day for years.
normmacdonald	696809633558585344	2016-02-08T21:35:37	I told So-Slow about how he was responsible for who he had become. And it's not like Swinemeat didn't agree with me.
normmacdonald	696530831280451584	2016-02-08T03:07:45	Doff of the cap to normmacdonald who called this way ahead of time. Dude knows his sports.
normmacdonald	696530917310009344	2016-02-08T03:08:06	normmacdonald mystic norm called it before the game, Denver money line.
normmacdonald	696531060499226626	2016-02-08T03:08:40	CarmichaelDave Normstradamus strikes again 
normmacdonald	696531109287309312	2016-02-08T03:08:52	normmacdonald Scratch that please. It's fine, they have 24 now. Wanna be friends?
normmacdonald	696531133912068097	2016-02-08T03:08:57	normmacdonald You called it.
normmacdonald	696531290720350208	2016-02-08T03:09:35	normmacdonald They need to go for a 2 point conversion so you will be right about your Broncos prediction of 24 points. SB50
normmacdonald	696531371276136449	2016-02-08T03:09:54	normmacdonald props to you norm.  you called it.
normmacdonald	696531561546579968	2016-02-08T03:10:39	normmacdonald Sadly you are right and he'll never live it down
normmacdonald	696530637042266112	2016-02-08T03:06:59	The prediction of Denver's 24 looks close now.
normmacdonald	696529828065873920	2016-02-08T03:03:46	Cam is yellah Camisyellah
normmacdonald	696529654283276288	2016-02-08T03:03:05	Cam is yellah.
normmacdonald	696529483780624384	2016-02-08T03:02:24	Cam just walked away from a Super Bowl.
normmacdonald	696528469815984128	2016-02-08T02:58:22	3 and out. Broncos
normmacdonald	696527202330890241	2016-02-08T02:53:20	Cam on the move.
normmacdonald	696524933950603264	2016-02-08T02:44:19	The Broncos bet on the money line still looking good, if you have the 5.5 you have a lock.
normmacdonald	696496529138253824	2016-02-08T00:51:27	a big 4th and 1for Denver. Holding will bring on the punter.
normmacdonald	696491485479325696	2016-02-08T00:31:24	TD Carolina!!!!!! 10-7 Denver.
normmacdonald	696491310585253888	2016-02-08T00:30:43	Cam has the ball at the 1 of Denver. Here we go.
normmacdonald	696490312655511552	2016-02-08T00:26:45	Cam is in on the run.
normmacdonald	696487739701612544	2016-02-08T00:16:31	So Talib doesn't cost the Broncos any points with the awful penalty and the ball returns to Peyton's hands.
normmacdonald	696487369759789058	2016-02-08T00:15:03	Ball at the 50, 3rd and 5.
normmacdonald	696487271004901377	2016-02-08T00:14:40	An unacceptable penalty on the part of Talib. Instead of punting, Carolina has a first down at midfield.
normmacdonald	696486794066415616	2016-02-08T00:12:46	Down goes Cam. 3 and out.
normmacdonald	696486648830296064	2016-02-08T00:12:11	And he is certainly loosening up.
normmacdonald	696485945692987393	2016-02-08T00:09:24	Sitting here ruining .normmacdonald's Super Bowl plans. 
normmacdonald	696486288422141952	2016-02-08T00:10:45	will loosen, that should read.
normmacdonald	696486210248638464	2016-02-08T00:10:27	Cam willies up now.
normmacdonald	696486098357190656	2016-02-08T00:10:00	Cam will get the ball again, and we are 9 minutes in without a panther first down.
normmacdonald	696485825517760512	2016-02-08T00:08:55	Cam holds on too long and the ball falls and the defence walks in. 10-0 Denver.
normmacdonald	696485497930018816	2016-02-08T00:07:37	TD Denver!!!!!!!!!!
normmacdonald	696485362068115457	2016-02-08T00:07:05	And the officials agree with me.
normmacdonald	696485212427984896	2016-02-08T00:06:29	The boys on the TV disagree.
normmacdonald	696485152185196544	2016-02-08T00:06:15	A challenge and this will be held up.
normmacdonald	696483504058597376	2016-02-07T23:59:42	A great punt and Cam will be up again.
normmacdonald	696483268716179456	2016-02-07T23:58:45	3 and out for the broncos.
normmacdonald	696482859108818945	2016-02-07T23:57:08	Peyton back on the field.
normmacdonald	696482046961528832	2016-02-07T23:53:54	Unless a trick play is on its way.
normmacdonald	696481938262007808	2016-02-07T23:53:28	As predicted, 3 and out.
normmacdonald	696481716727250944	2016-02-07T23:52:35	Cam showing nerves with the overthrow.
normmacdonald	696481422391922688	2016-02-07T23:51:25	Cam will not answer.
normmacdonald	696481087938166784	2016-02-07T23:50:06	So, Willem, the idea is you play Marilyn. It'll be funny cause she's a beautiful woman and you're a gross looking guy.
normmacdonald	696480596827090945	2016-02-07T23:48:08	3-0 Denver. We'll see how Cam responds.
normmacdonald	696480041736122368	2016-02-07T23:45:56	And now the kicker trots on to try a 34 harder.
normmacdonald	696479494756917248	2016-02-07T23:43:46	All the way to the 14 now. Incredible.
normmacdonald	696479386069938176	2016-02-07T23:43:20	Peyton walking down the field.
normmacdonald	696478920065941504	2016-02-07T23:41:29	Peyton is dead calm.
normmacdonald	696478701500772353	2016-02-07T23:40:37	Peyton begins with an 18 yard strike.
normmacdonald	696476589475762176	2016-02-07T23:32:13	Coming up. THE COIN TOSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
normmacdonald	696476459855015937	2016-02-07T23:31:42	Marlee Matlin was incredible. My deaf friend says it was the best rendition he's never heard.
normmacdonald	696462965617262592	2016-02-07T22:38:05	Denver wins 24-20.
normmacdonald	696462878442819584	2016-02-07T22:37:44	A lot of people, people like Ritchie the K, have been pushing me for an exact score. This kind of thing is unpredictable but I'll do it.
normmacdonald	696462625467543552	2016-02-07T22:36:44	If you would like to take the 5.5 points, be my guest.
normmacdonald	696462452494454784	2016-02-07T22:36:02	The proper bet is Denver on the money line. They will win the game outright.
normmacdonald	696461913165684740	2016-02-07T22:33:54	And there's your answer.
normmacdonald	696461572277800960	2016-02-07T22:32:33	But, what if you're Peyton? Is this your year? If it isn't, you're done.
normmacdonald	696461351472877568	2016-02-07T22:31:40	What if you're Cam Newton. Is this your year? It could be. But if it's not? That's ok. Lotsa years left.
normmacdonald	696460842225676288	2016-02-07T22:29:39	Intangibles. This game will be all about intangibles.
normmacdonald	696460304272654336	2016-02-07T22:27:30	If you're smarter than the public, you should win. Not enough to cover the juice, but you should win.
normmacdonald	696459918518280193	2016-02-07T22:25:58	People often think the lines are decided by the book. They are not. They are decided by the public.
normmacdonald	696449858555633664	2016-02-07T21:46:00	The line is Carolina(-5.5). This simply means that Carolina is favored by 5.5 points.If you bet Carolina, you win if they win by 6 or more.
normmacdonald	696416595757772800	2016-02-07T19:33:49	Today is an incredibly good day to bet. Most Superbowl days are. This is because the way lines are figured in the NFL.
normmacdonald	696416071562080256	2016-02-07T19:31:44	I don't gamble and haven't for some time but I'd be lying if I said I haven't been giving the big game thought. Considerable thought.
normmacdonald	696415735640252417	2016-02-07T19:30:24	And today, of course, everyone without an ego wants to know what I think.
normmacdonald	696415574398623744	2016-02-07T19:29:46	Calls are coming in from everywhere. I don't gamble and when I did, I lost plenty. But my opinion is still sought out.
normmacdonald	696287295238832128	2016-02-07T11:00:02	Some joke.
normmacdonald	696287258773590017	2016-02-07T10:59:53	So-Slow laughed non-stop for 10 weeks after that day.
normmacdonald	696287108416143360	2016-02-07T10:59:17	And laughing.
normmacdonald	696287060013875200	2016-02-07T10:59:06	But they only found one. When they found So'Slow he was down a ways in a brook, damn near naked, trying to fish with a brand new nail.
normmacdonald	696286676847464452	2016-02-07T10:57:34	I really thought they'd find two lying odd, heads a couple crumples, in the green wet woods.
normmacdonald	696286287494455296	2016-02-07T10:56:01	But nobody knows I was there. And when I say nobody I mean nobody. Including So-Slow.
normmacdonald	696286080966873088	2016-02-07T10:55:12	I saw the boy run, I saw the boy run fast, I heard the awful roar, I saw the boy fly.
normmacdonald	696285798019178497	2016-02-07T10:54:05	I'm gonna tell you something. Nobody knows I was there. but I was. I saw the whole thing.
normmacdonald	696285156382879744	2016-02-07T10:51:32	He thought his son was a jackrabbit, only for a second, but a second can be worthless and a second can be gold. So-Slow never missed.
normmacdonald	696284731906793472	2016-02-07T10:49:51	And it was So-Slow who lit the fire.
normmacdonald	696284531188301828	2016-02-07T10:49:03	This was back when So-Slow was the happiest he'd ever been in his whole life because he had a boy who was alive and not burned dead.
normmacdonald	696283986046246912	2016-02-07T10:46:53	The idea was we'd all get So-Slow when he got home from work, ambush him.
normmacdonald	696283733410754562	2016-02-07T10:45:53	It sure sounded like the lock to me and Swinemeat.
normmacdonald	696283563700854784	2016-02-07T10:45:12	They told us all about it, how it was very stylish and all.
normmacdonald	696283379646398464	2016-02-07T10:44:28	And that was Barry. The smartest man there is.
normmacdonald	696283285492641792	2016-02-07T10:44:06	The smartest man you know is the smartest man there is.
normmacdonald	696283186670673921	2016-02-07T10:43:42	Me, I didn't understand and neither did Swinemeat but Barry, he was all behind it, and Prairie Dog too.
normmacdonald	696282892016578561	2016-02-07T10:42:32	One time, about 2 years ago, So-Slow's old lady decided it was time So-Slow quit. Quit everything.
normmacdonald	696282141412339713	2016-02-07T10:39:33	Nothing else.
normmacdonald	696282093983141888	2016-02-07T10:39:22	Nothing else is gonna save So-Slow now.
normmacdonald	696281951905325057	2016-02-07T10:38:48	But if we come back with anything less than the good stuff, no use coming back.
normmacdonald	696281819168112640	2016-02-07T10:38:16	We spent all the money. On the young girls. On the young boys. On full slabs of ribs and corn on the cob and greens too.
normmacdonald	696281444423892992	2016-02-07T10:36:47	We don't got the money that'll buy us the good stuff.
normmacdonald	696281320750624768	2016-02-07T10:36:17	The problem is we don't got the money.
normmacdonald	696281222994001920	2016-02-07T10:35:54	I'm taking downtown and Swinemeat is in the east end. We need the good stuff.
normmacdonald	696281004000935936	2016-02-07T10:35:02	But nobody's drying up the streets this fine evening.
normmacdonald	696280825638223872	2016-02-07T10:34:19	And the funny thing is nobody knows who's doing it. The cops or the good guys. Each got his reason.
normmacdonald	696280588035104769	2016-02-07T10:33:23	Sometimes they'll do that, you know. Dry up the streets.
normmacdonald	696280456904335360	2016-02-07T10:32:51	And I find it plenty. It's not like they're drying up the streets or nuthin'.
normmacdonald	696280286946955264	2016-02-07T10:32:11	But all night I look.I ignore the girls. I ignore the boys. I 'm looking for the good stuff.
normmacdonald	696280073066840065	2016-02-07T10:31:20	I'll go find some good stuff.
normmacdonald	696280006394130432	2016-02-07T10:31:04	Not interested? Fine. Not interested.
normmacdonald	695822429319368704	2016-02-06T04:12:49	Hey normmacdonald !  Is this you??   It must be! 
normmacdonald	695525163983577088	2016-02-05T08:31:35	normmacdonald norm seems a little bit mentally challenged
normmacdonald	695524967006339072	2016-02-05T08:30:49	So-Slow always had trouble sleeping. I mean ever since, you know.
normmacdonald	695524622226190336	2016-02-05T08:29:26	So we went hungry, me So-Slow and Swinemeat.
normmacdonald	695523228010151937	2016-02-05T08:23:54	We woulda had 100 dollars stead o nothin.
normmacdonald	695523131016884224	2016-02-05T08:23:31	As I watched the joker pick up our cash, I thought, geez, I probably coulda beat him.
normmacdonald	695522873297887232	2016-02-05T08:22:29	He lost the 50 bucks to a bad 9-ball player in about a minute.
normmacdonald	695521642781364224	2016-02-05T08:17:36	So-Slow was never the same since last year when he killed a jackrabbit that turned out to be his 4 year old son.
normmacdonald	695521264983617536	2016-02-05T08:16:06	I handed So-Slow my cue. "You play."
normmacdonald	695520657115721728	2016-02-05T08:13:41	I pulled a tuna salad sandwich out of my pocket and it was coming apart in my hand and fell everywhere and some in my mouth.
normmacdonald	695519733152501760	2016-02-05T08:10:01	I coulda killed the sonofabitch.

normmacdonald	695518419035123712	2016-02-05T08:04:47	So-slow got real drunk when we were in Winnipeg and set me up in a big game. A big game for me. Big.
normmacdonald	695517652429582336	2016-02-05T08:01:45	SummerTerra sorry, Summer, I was sick.
normmacdonald	695152324398854144	2016-02-04T07:50:04	So-slow, thought different.
normmacdonald	695152228357672960	2016-02-04T07:49:41	We were good enough that we never had to bey any beers, but no better.
normmacdonald	695151871900540929	2016-02-04T07:48:16	I had friends, and they all shot pool and some were a little better, some a little worse.
normmacdonald	695151739087925248	2016-02-04T07:47:44	I played at bars, where the tables were bent and broken. Just like me.
normmacdonald	695151558284083200	2016-02-04T07:47:01	I shot pool. it was the thing I did best, but I was a two-bit talent and wasn't about to get better.
normmacdonald	692520870871502848	2016-01-28T01:33:36	How to fight and when to fight.

normmacdonald	692520300983029760	2016-01-28T01:31:20	When I was a boy, about 15, I ws on my own. I had friends, though, and one was Sam.

normmacdonald	691427491248930816	2016-01-25T01:08:54	The warning happens.
normmacdonald	691419071460446208	2016-01-25T00:35:27	First quarter ends.
normmacdonald	691417676925706240	2016-01-25T00:29:54	In DraftKings, I am in 621st of 680.
normmacdonald	691416853827047424	2016-01-25T00:26:38	17-0.
normmacdonald	691416799737413632	2016-01-25T00:26:25	Newton to Brown, TD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
normmacdonald	691416703264120832	2016-01-25T00:26:02	Stewart runs for 2, and we have a 3rd down.
normmacdonald	691416545050783744	2016-01-25T00:25:24	Newton has the ball now, at this own 2, and on first down foes deep for nothing.
normmacdonald	691413251851026432	2016-01-25T00:12:19	That's followed by encroachment and watch out.
normmacdonald	691413142996254720	2016-01-25T00:11:53	Newton to Oleson, best throw and catch of this early game, and ball at the 30.
normmacdonald	691412882672648192	2016-01-25T00:10:51	With the play clock winding down, Newton calls a timeout, ball at midfeild, 3rd and 2 for Newton.
normmacdonald	691412049931276288	2016-01-25T00:07:33	There are 680 players. I must make top 300 to double my money.
normmacdonald	691411941894426624	2016-01-25T00:07:07	Punt to the 20 and Ginn runs back to midfield before slipping. That slip stopped a TD. First DraftKting update. I have Ginn.
normmacdonald	691411609277693952	2016-01-25T00:05:48	Palmer under pressure, throws and another incompletion.
normmacdonald	691411483947700224	2016-01-25T00:05:18	3rd and 12.
normmacdonald	691411432571670529	2016-01-25T00:05:05	Palmer goes deep and misses again.
normmacdonald	691411351890046976	2016-01-25T00:04:46	Handoff and a loss of 2, 2nd and 12.
normmacdonald	691411259967688704	2016-01-25T00:04:24	Palmer finally finds a first down.
normmacdonald	691410951984185344	2016-01-25T00:03:11	2nd down and Carson has still not thrown a reception. 3rd down.
normmacdonald	691410840721891328	2016-01-25T00:02:44	Palmer  nearly throws a pick.
normmacdonald	691410223441969152	2016-01-25T00:00:17	We'll keep you in touch of what score I need to make my money in the 50-50 and what players I have as we move on in the game.
normmacdonald	691410035377721345	2016-01-24T23:59:32	However, no chance Manning can use the same strategy next week against the winner of this late game. Fave away ball to Brady way too often.
normmacdonald	691409779718168577	2016-01-24T23:58:31	However, the final score by Gronkowski from Brady might make it tough. Still think I'm on the winning side of it.
normmacdonald	691409525799129088	2016-01-24T23:57:31	I have decided to play a draftings game today. Had neither team in the early game and look to win it just on their terrible stats.
normmacdonald	691409198270156801	2016-01-24T23:56:13	Kick is good. Carolina 3-0.
normmacdonald	691408967197548548	2016-01-24T23:55:18	Cards need to take a timeout, and that is a mistake.
normmacdonald	691408847928307712	2016-01-24T23:54:49	45 yard attempt.
normmacdonald	691408776935505921	2016-01-24T23:54:32	Incomplete to Oleson.
normmacdonald	691408651236577282	2016-01-24T23:54:02	Needs 2.
normmacdonald	691408621523972097	2016-01-24T23:53:55	Gain of 5, and Cam will face his first.
normmacdonald	691408539378520066	2016-01-24T23:53:36	Early, but Cam has still not faced a 3rd down.
normmacdonald	691408436664217600	2016-01-24T23:53:11	Pass to Stewart for 3.
normmacdonald	691408352459370496	2016-01-24T23:52:51	Newton to Ginn, and the Panthers at the 25 of Arizona, FG range.
normmacdonald	691408156883181568	2016-01-24T23:52:05	Cam runs for a yard on first down, 3 minutes into the game.
normmacdonald	691408013005950976	2016-01-24T23:51:30	Stewart to Brown for 14, ball a t midfield.
normmacdonald	691407804796575744	2016-01-24T23:50:41	Handoff, and Stewart runs for 2.
normmacdonald	691407666464206848	2016-01-24T23:50:08	Cam trots out.
normmacdonald	691407607609712640	2016-01-24T23:49:54	And the third is Palmer's first throw, misses well high. Nerves show early, Arizona shows nerves early. Punt reaches the 30.
normmacdonald	691407262699524096	2016-01-24T23:48:31	Run for a 7
normmacdonald	691407143237386240	2016-01-24T23:48:03	Run for a 9.
normmacdonald	691407101277503488	2016-01-24T23:47:53	Cards will have the ball first.
normmacdonald	691406992812838912	2016-01-24T23:47:27	The second game is underway.

normmacdonald	688697408113410050	2016-01-17T12:20:32	He watched the grenade softly fly through the air, and he thought of how it reminded him of a girl pitching a softball.
normmacdonald	688696992105537536	2016-01-17T12:18:52	He stopped reloading.
normmacdonald	688696950099554304	2016-01-17T12:18:42	The German looked up once and he saw our man pry the grenade from his useless right hand to his left hand.
