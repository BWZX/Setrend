KeithOlbermann	694953371372015616	2016-02-03T18:39:30	A good Bob &amp; Ray collection is here:  and if you search for them and "McCarthy" on iTunes you'll get a sample.
KeithOlbermann	694952208702562306	2016-02-03T18:34:52	10) For my money, we lost an American hero today. Rest in peace, Bob Elliott, and thank you for everything.
KeithOlbermann	694951999100608512	2016-02-03T18:34:02	9) 50 years later Bob proudly, subtly told me that Cohn saw them, sneered, and found the seat furthest from them in the nearly empty cabin.
KeithOlbermann	694951680778113024	2016-02-03T18:32:46	8) Years later Bob, Ray, their families were virtually the only passengers on a flight. Just before take off who races on board but Roy Cohn
KeithOlbermann	694951288447049728	2016-02-03T18:31:13	7) I thought they had as much courage (and impact) as Murrow. And so did McCarthy's henchman (future Trump role model) Roy Cohn.
KeithOlbermann	694950920665354240	2016-02-03T18:29:45	6) They were. Ray skewered McCarthy; Bob flattened Joseph Welch; together Bob &amp; Ray let the air out of the Army-McCarthy hearings.
KeithOlbermann	694950698614722561	2016-02-03T18:28:52	5) I said our Holy Grail was those Joe McCarthy episodes from 1954. "Oh, those?" Champlin paused. "I think they're out in my garage."
KeithOlbermann	694950432242802688	2016-02-03T18:27:49	4) He phoned. "You recorded them TOO? I bought a recording phonograph in 1954 just to preserve them." I told him of the 'other' recorders.
KeithOlbermann	694950130802409472	2016-02-03T18:26:37	3) When Ray Goulding died in '90 the LA Times arts editor Charles Champlin wrote a brokenhearted review. I copied a cassette, sent it to him
KeithOlbermann	694949727423565827	2016-02-03T18:25:01	2) I began taping it. Maybe 100 hours all told. It later proved that other fans - in Boston in 1949, in NY in 1962, had the same impulse
KeithOlbermann	694949493305929728	2016-02-03T18:24:05	1) At 13, I concluded the work of the late Bob Elliott and Ray Goulding was so profoundly excellent + different that I needed to preserve it
KeithOlbermann	694946498619011072	2016-02-03T18:12:11	RIP to the great Bob Elliott. Condolences to Chris, Abby and the family.
