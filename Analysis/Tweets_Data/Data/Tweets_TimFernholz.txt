TimFernholz	717679959167410176	2016-04-06T11:46:50	Sanders, a politician, takes refuge in vagueness. But it should be noted that he's getting less specific because he knows he can't deliver.
TimFernholz	717679509227642880	2016-04-06T11:45:03	He knows exactly who has that power. And he knows he can't use it! But he can't admit it now.
TimFernholz	717679208596643841	2016-04-06T11:43:51	And so he says things like "Well, I don’t know if the Fed has it. But I think the administration can have it."
TimFernholz	717679080536219648	2016-04-06T11:43:21	He can't now say, "A captive senate will do what I want." But he also can't say (honestly) that he'll break up the banks within a year.
TimFernholz	717678966891536384	2016-04-06T11:42:54	But now he is losing to Clinton by a million votes and two hundred delegates. Seems clear if he wins the nomination he won't win the senate
TimFernholz	717678815158411264	2016-04-06T11:42:18	Sanders could be previously be specific on that front because his political revolution seemed viable—we'll sweep the senate!
TimFernholz	717678519170498560	2016-04-06T11:41:07	The problem with any detailed discussion of breaking up the banks is it revealed the president cannot do it without senate appointees
TimFernholz	717678357886935040	2016-04-06T11:40:28	...where he cited specific sections of Dodd-Frank in discussing how to break up the banks. 
TimFernholz	717678246423306240	2016-04-06T11:40:02	His evasiveness in that interview wasn't from a lack of knowledge, and we know that because he gave a detailed speech about banks...
TimFernholz	717678137832783872	2016-04-06T11:39:36	I think petereavis gets tricked by Sanders in his generous parsing of the Senator's bank remarks to the Daily News

TimFernholz	701765739066355712	2016-02-22T13:49:25	Dalton_Barker He's won two elections in his life. Maybe in 1998! Lost in 1994, then in 2002 he won as a Bush in a Republican year.
TimFernholz	701765322374832129	2016-02-22T13:47:45	Dalton_Barker Clinton is a much better politician than Jeb Bush.
TimFernholz	701765215625617408	2016-02-22T13:47:20	Dalton_Barker Oh, I think he did. He thought he could walk right into it and couldn't cope when he had to actually win over voters.
TimFernholz	701764933269200897	2016-02-22T13:46:12	Dalton_Barker yup, that's fine, just tweetin'. I would note that you haven't come up with any argument that Bush is a good politician.
TimFernholz	701763392151887873	2016-02-22T13:40:05	Dalton_Barker I disagree, I guess ? Good politicians make good candidates. There's a distinction between good pol and a good office-holder.
TimFernholz	701763205731844097	2016-02-22T13:39:21	Dalton_Barker like I said, not really about the media. Just saying that Jeb Bush is a not a skilled politician.
TimFernholz	701761814988775424	2016-02-22T13:33:49	Dalton_Barker my broader point isn't about media. It's that Jeb was a bad candidate, and would have been a bad candidate in any cycle.
TimFernholz	701761695740465157	2016-02-22T13:33:21	Dalton_Barker

TimFernholz	701760283694514177	2016-02-22T13:27:44	Dalton_Barker FWIW, Huckabee Carson and Palin were still leaders in the evangelical movement. Bush was working for Lehman in the meantime.
TimFernholz	701759921717645312	2016-02-22T13:26:18	Dalton_Barker that's nice to think but I watched him flub question after question from voters in NH. He's just not good at politics
TimFernholz	701759798392528897	2016-02-22T13:25:48	Dalton_Barker right, and the press should have treated Bush like Huckabee, Palin, Carson and Trump instead of the front-runner
TimFernholz	701758882188804096	2016-02-22T13:22:10	Dalton_Barker would a governor out office since '07 and not named Bush get on stage at CPAC?

TimFernholz	701757112993628161	2016-02-22T13:15:08	changeist ha!
TimFernholz	701756941085884416	2016-02-22T13:14:27	Dalton_Barker I think that's a credulous reading but you're welcome to it
TimFernholz	701756657982955520	2016-02-22T13:13:19	But Bush didn't lose because of Trump, or his decency. He lost because he was a bad politician.

TimFernholz	684145739463798786	2016-01-04T22:53:49	AlexParkerDC but the corp. tax realm has been receiving more attention/change since 2008 and I hope you're right about the direction
TimFernholz	684145471149965312	2016-01-04T22:52:45	AlexParkerDC heh, I think that's just because Howard Schultz thinks one day he will be asked to run for president

TimFernholz	684144986850459653	2016-01-04T22:50:50	AlexParkerDC WilliamFreeland I think that's true that they think that, and I haven't seen it proven wrong in practice
TimFernholz	684144819992670208	2016-01-04T22:50:10	AlexParkerDC WilliamFreeland heh, they are aware of it but I'm not convinced they consider it a real cost. 
TimFernholz	684143360085471236	2016-01-04T22:44:22	AlexParkerDC WilliamFreeland well sure, but I've given up expecting corporate leaders to do anything but the bare minimum on tax
TimFernholz	684142857586880512	2016-01-04T22:42:22	AlexParkerDC WilliamFreeland there I agree completely
TimFernholz	684142738430902273	2016-01-04T22:41:54	AlexParkerDC WilliamFreeland well tell me more on that one!
TimFernholz	684142640317726720	2016-01-04T22:41:30	AlexParkerDC WilliamFreeland too much time analyzing the behavior of actors in negotiations! but yes US law more forgiving on this point
TimFernholz	684142093208580096	2016-01-04T22:39:20	AlexParkerDC WilliamFreeland indeed, what's on trial here is Ireland's national business model, Apple just a prominent user therof
TimFernholz	684141931027427328	2016-01-04T22:38:41	AlexParkerDC WilliamFreeland and what baffles me is the willingness to offer defenses of Apple that the company's own lawyers don't make
TimFernholz	684141803344408576	2016-01-04T22:38:11	AlexParkerDC WilliamFreeland seeing what happened in the negotiation is the due process of following up on that
TimFernholz	684141741277097987	2016-01-04T22:37:56	AlexParkerDC WilliamFreeland Apple's problem is that its taxes do speak for themselves—they obviously did not use arms length principle
TimFernholz	684140132979589120	2016-01-04T22:31:33	AlexParkerDC WilliamFreeland at a basic level, all law enforcement is based on analyzing the behavior of actors in negotations
TimFernholz	684139291786752000	2016-01-04T22:28:12	AlexParkerDC WilliamFreeland then Apple will have no problem reassuring the EC on this point then 
TimFernholz	684139001759035392	2016-01-04T22:27:03	AlexParkerDC WilliamFreeland right! you'll be shocked to learn I think that's a big problem, too
TimFernholz	684138399557644289	2016-01-04T22:24:39	AlexParkerDC WilliamFreeland Apple is using some standard to allocate its IP expenses, and I'm sure it's not guesswork
TimFernholz	684138273237798912	2016-01-04T22:24:09	AlexParkerDC WilliamFreeland I'd like to know what Apple's response is to that
TimFernholz	684138213213138944	2016-01-04T22:23:55	AlexParkerDC WilliamFreeland the EC released evidence that Apple's Ireland tax was just a backroom deal without doing that exercise
TimFernholz	684137915274915840	2016-01-04T22:22:44	AlexParkerDC WilliamFreeland no, not at all! I'm sure there's a range, and I'd love to learn what it is.
TimFernholz	684137190109110273	2016-01-04T22:19:51	AlexParkerDC WilliamFreeland well you'd have to evaluate the argument before you'd say it was ok. But it's not just after-the-fact...

TimFernholz	684126553463218180	2016-01-04T21:37:35	WilliamFreeland AlexParkerDC but I will return to you once corp tax reform opens up in US congress and these are more pressing q's
TimFernholz	684126468868288516	2016-01-04T21:37:15	WilliamFreeland AlexParkerDC today, my interest is not the best of all possible worlds but whether Apple is breaking the rules in this one
TimFernholz	684125262586490880	2016-01-04T21:32:27	WilliamFreeland AlexParkerDC these are all however good questions just beyond my remit
TimFernholz	684125064204283904	2016-01-04T21:31:40	WilliamFreeland AlexParkerDC this is way more normative than our prev. conv, I just mean in the specific case EC is investigating...
TimFernholz	684123976872898560	2016-01-04T21:27:21	WilliamFreeland AlexParkerDC no no, I merely want to talk about transfer pricing and defend the bourgeousie
TimFernholz	684122504730914817	2016-01-04T21:21:30	WilliamFreeland AlexParkerDC My, you're not familiar with my work. I'm always around if you want to try convincing me with an argument!
TimFernholz	684121815678058496	2016-01-04T21:18:45	WilliamFreeland AlexParkerDC Here's my question for you guys: Do you think Apple's transfer pricing is economically justifiable?
TimFernholz	684121165657407489	2016-01-04T21:16:10	WilliamFreeland AlexParkerDC cool comment, I still disagree. not even sure we're discussing frameworks here...
TimFernholz	684120734285860865	2016-01-04T21:14:28	AlexParkerDC it is that "you made a policy decision for a specific company that was not based on international standards."
TimFernholz	684120633014378496	2016-01-04T21:14:03	AlexParkerDC sure, but Apple and Ireland isn't a case of "your general income tax policy is unfair to your trade commitments."
TimFernholz	684119441311948804	2016-01-04T21:09:19	AlexParkerDC but seriously, that's how trade agreements work.  you make policy commitments and arbitrators attempt to enforce them
TimFernholz	684118898543869952	2016-01-04T21:07:10	AlexParkerDC yup, you never see that happen....except the WTO basically all the time for every country.
TimFernholz	684118291934240769	2016-01-04T21:04:45	AlexParkerDC also global profit-shifting using IP licensing is also fairly new, no surprise it takes awhile for authorities to catch up
TimFernholz	684117985817133056	2016-01-04T21:03:32	AlexParkerDC the EC is effectively 30 years old, everything is "new." Not sure who is freaking out about the investigation...
TimFernholz	684117290720321536	2016-01-04T21:00:47	AlexParkerDC the relevant treaty doesn't define state aid with examples, it offers an economic definition that is applied in this case
TimFernholz	684099614732075008	2016-01-04T19:50:32	AlexParkerDC right, and those negotiations have rules that must be followed. Complexity doesn't mean you can't understand something.
TimFernholz	684098941013635072	2016-01-04T19:47:52	AlexParkerDC right, and the EC is investigating the government bc what it wanted violated rules about transfer pricing the gov agreed to
TimFernholz	684085155317833728	2016-01-04T18:53:05	AlexParkerDC correct, but you should to read preliminary report that explains Apple's role in creating Irish policy

TimFernholz	684081110838579200	2016-01-04T18:37:01	AlexParkerDC is this just about the euros/dollars joke in the headline? I'm not suggesting he consciously chose his words bc of Italy
TimFernholz	684077907484999680	2016-01-04T18:24:17	AlexParkerDC it's also a fairly open secret if you talk to those in the "tax optimization" industry or  former Apple employees
TimFernholz	684077455792074753	2016-01-04T18:22:29	AlexParkerDC I guess I disagree about the level of subjectivity; multiple investigations into profit-shifting have been compelling

TimFernholz	684075056247488513	2016-01-04T18:12:57	AlexParkerDC I think it's notable that Apple has yet to argue that, but even if they did, it wouldn't make them correct
TimFernholz	684074964866174976	2016-01-04T18:12:35	AlexParkerDC indeed, many companies abuse transfer pricing to shift profits out of high-tax jurisdictions
TimFernholz	684061751692890112	2016-01-04T17:20:05	AlexParkerDC while plenty of grey in international tax, the position that is clearly wrong is: Apple paid its taxes in full.
