Nate_Cohn	725130174585561088	2016-04-27T01:11:20	Bloomfield--first suburb of Hartford to come in--goes 75-25 to Clinton and cuts Sanders' vote lead in half.
Nate_Cohn	725127869664468994	2016-04-27T01:02:11	Guys, Trump is at or above 60 percent in every state so far. This is not what was expected.
Nate_Cohn	725124957290807296	2016-04-27T00:50:36	Trump faring as well or better than New York, where he was thought to have a home state edge, in every state so far tonight.
Nate_Cohn	725123619454652417	2016-04-27T00:45:17	We had Trump at 52 in Connecticut, 50 in Delaware. He's going to clear that by a lot.
Nate_Cohn	725123115706138625	2016-04-27T00:43:17	Sanders doing well in the early CT count, but a lot of vote left in Clinton's best areas--including the wealthy suburbs of NYC
Nate_Cohn	725120712537706496	2016-04-27T00:33:44	It is safe to say that Trump is outperforming any benchmark based on his past performances, like our demog. model. Extremely strong showing
Nate_Cohn	725120295103807488	2016-04-27T00:32:05	Clinton opens with a 19 point lead in Delaware, with 20% reporting. Trump has 60%.
Nate_Cohn	725118715667292160	2016-04-27T00:25:48	Trump projected as the winner in Rhode Island. The only thing to watch: does Cruz fall short of 10 percent, or can Trump get 67 in a CD?
Nate_Cohn	725118284824215552	2016-04-27T00:24:05	A similar story unfolding in Connecticut--Clinton winning diverse, urban, and affluent areas, Sanders winning rural white working class

Nate_Cohn	724967726926729217	2016-04-26T14:25:50	On the Democratic side, the two Senate races in PA and MD are probably most interesting. But we'll see whether Sanders wins Rhode Island

Nate_Cohn	723597019420450816	2016-04-22T19:39:07	My best guess, gun to head, is that ex-felon reenfranchisement could boost the Dem margin in VA by around .5 points.

Nate_Cohn	722917442440179712	2016-04-20T22:38:44	I do think that Trump is likelier than McCain to lose CA delegates in a clear win, thanks to vulnerabilities in low R, high-edu dist.

Nate_Cohn	722916636118769664	2016-04-20T22:35:31	I mainly think people are confusing the average outcome (we have no idea sooo 90) with delegate outcome in an average trump win (T+5 = 130?)

Nate_Cohn	722861372178964481	2016-04-20T18:55:55	One tentative observation: Trump is now faring better in closed than open primaries. I wonder if it's keeping out the anyone-but-Trump votes
Nate_Cohn	722856390528671744	2016-04-20T18:36:08	Nate_Cohn Fwiw 
Nate_Cohn	722855054806396928	2016-04-20T18:30:49	If Trump loses Indiana, his chances could come down to how the 54 PA unbound delegates vote at the convention
Nate_Cohn	722854513237856256	2016-04-20T18:28:40	Trump is favored to win just 17 pledged delegates in PA, instead of 43 in a proportional system, 65 w WTA by CD. 
Nate_Cohn	722853801439268864	2016-04-20T18:25:50	The Pennsylvania loophole primary could cost Trump the nomination 
Nate_Cohn	722827824453713921	2016-04-20T16:42:37	Quinnipiac has Trump at 48%. He needs 50 to claim all of the state's delegates; our model has him at 51 
Nate_Cohn	722824363385327616	2016-04-20T16:28:52	New York is one of those states where election results maps really, really don't make any sense without a cartogram.

Nate_Cohn	722660424156639232	2016-04-20T05:37:26	jimcupples let me put it this way. sanders has won a net-130 delegates from all wins in purple /blue states. she won net-115 in FL/OH/VA

Nate_Cohn	722643891892187136	2016-04-20T04:31:44	One thing is that the California delegate margin for Trump gets pretty lopsided if he's winning by 5 points. 133 here

Nate_Cohn	722625405748977664	2016-04-20T03:18:17	The Republican vote in NY-15--the most Dem district in the US, worth 3 delegates--is currently at 849 votes with 81% of precincts reported
Nate_Cohn	722622479974404096	2016-04-20T03:06:39	I do think, fwiw, that Sanders can win by 18 in MT/OR. But he's probably going to lose by 18 in NJ/MD, too
Nate_Cohn	722622259685367808	2016-04-20T03:05:47	Sanders now needs to win by 18 in every state, something he's only done in VT/NH and caucuses. There's 1 caucus left 
Nate_Cohn	722621498301804544	2016-04-20T03:02:45	Clinton's victory confirms she's strong in the big, diverse, affluent blue states on the coasts (outside the South)

Nate_Cohn	722617740616417280	2016-04-20T02:47:49	A lot of the Democratic vote left is in Westchester and Nassau Counties, where Clinton is over 60. She probably wins by 15.
Nate_Cohn	722617336893726720	2016-04-20T02:46:13	Nassau County finally reports some votes (about half of them): Trump 69, Clinton 61

Nate_Cohn	722611916317847552	2016-04-20T02:24:40	Clinton strongholds all diverse and/or affluent: 70 percent in the Bronx, 67 percent in Westchester County, 66 percent in Manhattan
Nate_Cohn	722609067575885824	2016-04-20T02:13:21	Clinton on track to finish up by about 13 points, per Upshot model. Plenty of Clinton votes left in NYC/burbs 
Nate_Cohn	722605858702667777	2016-04-20T02:00:36	To be fair to Bernie: Clinton is basically only winning in the southern part of New York.
Nate_Cohn	722605668906188801	2016-04-20T01:59:51	At the moment, Trump would win 92 of the 95 delegates statewide (if AP count is accurate)
Nate_Cohn	722603768794202112	2016-04-20T01:52:18	Looks like Trump could approach or exceed 90 of New York's 95 delegates

Nate_Cohn	722601862654988288	2016-04-20T01:44:44	Kasich maintaining a slight lead in Manhattan--suggests Trump could lose both NY-10 and 12.
Nate_Cohn	722601534241030144	2016-04-20T01:43:25	The extent that Sanders underperformed Teachout in affuent white liberal areas is really striking. He's holding up in working class Upstate

Nate_Cohn	722600686052065281	2016-04-20T01:40:03	Clinton projected winner by NBC News; looks like an easy double digit win
Nate_Cohn	722599240858542081	2016-04-20T01:34:18	Clinton sweep of Manhattan/white liberal Brooklyn, but Bernie winning the gentrifier vote by a clear margin 
Nate_Cohn	722598875413016577	2016-04-20T01:32:51	Just eyeballing this, I'd say Trump is in the mid-80s delegate wise; but the 'measurement error' of eyeballing is considerable
Nate_Cohn	722598380061503488	2016-04-20T01:30:53	Clinton has the edge in most of 'white liberal' Brooklyn, but Sanders is ahead in Bushwick, Astoria
Nate_Cohn	722598040314490880	2016-04-20T01:29:32	The Democratic race, in the end, should could come very close to pre-election polls.

Nate_Cohn	722596827237912577	2016-04-20T01:24:43	Trump has 60 percent of the vote in nonwhite precincts in New York City. Bodes very well for his chances in places like NY-15.
Nate_Cohn	722596411544625153	2016-04-20T01:23:04	Clinton so far is ahead 60-40 in majority white precincts of New York City. This does not look like a good night for Sanders.
Nate_Cohn	722596245345288196	2016-04-20T01:22:24	Clinton sweeping Manhattan, much of white liberal Brooklyn. This is not Bernie's night. 
Nate_Cohn	722595684625551360	2016-04-20T01:20:11	The Democratic results so far look a lot more like the pre-election polls than the exits.
Nate_Cohn	722595488172793857	2016-04-20T01:19:24	The numbers for Trump out of Staten Island are pretty stupendous: he has 80 percent of the vote with one-third of precincts reporting.
Nate_Cohn	722594494055624704	2016-04-20T01:15:27	Almost all of the precincts out of New York City so far are majority white.
Nate_Cohn	722594055515979776	2016-04-20T01:13:42	Clinton is ahead, 56-44, in white precincts in New York City so far, including a lot of areas in Brooklyn where Bernie should fare well
Nate_Cohn	722593762053107712	2016-04-20T01:12:32	Clinton faring well in initial results out of Bernie country 
Nate_Cohn	722592578210820096	2016-04-20T01:07:50	Trump at 80 percent in the first four precincts out of Staten Island. lol
Nate_Cohn	722592136768696321	2016-04-20T01:06:05	Trump and Clinton out to early leads--Trump at 54%, Clinton at 62%, in fragmentary initial results out of Queens and Brooklyn
Nate_Cohn	722590969863004160	2016-04-20T01:01:26	Democratic exits point towards what would be a disappointing finish for Clinton: just a 4 point lead, 52-48. We'll see!
Nate_Cohn	722590853940834304	2016-04-20T01:00:59	He's at 46% in 'rural upstate'

Nate_Cohn	720325663668903936	2016-04-13T18:59:55	I think the basic split in the Marist poll makes sense--but the district lines blur his weakness considerably

Nate_Cohn	717768163983798272	2016-04-06T17:37:20	And both tracked very near 2010 midterms 
Nate_Cohn	717755916519620608	2016-04-06T16:48:40	This Stephen Curry stat, in a fantastic story on how the GSW were built, is absolutely nuts  
Nate_Cohn	717737019250753536	2016-04-06T15:33:34	GoldsmithB yeah but Cruz outperformed 
Nate_Cohn	717720235306921984	2016-04-06T14:26:53	Trump hit expectations but Cruz surpassed them by a lot--enough to keep Trump below 1237 if it continued 
Nate_Cohn	717715160752848900	2016-04-06T14:06:43	Cruz's newest round of gains, if durable, put him on track to deny a Trump a majority of delegates 
Nate_Cohn	717593089339166721	2016-04-06T06:01:39	Will the direction of strategic voting be as obvious, with Cruz ahead and party support? Can influence pace of Rubio consolidation, too
Nate_Cohn	717592896472489984	2016-04-06T06:00:53	Kasich's weakness is a little complicated, though. He underperformed the polls, which could mean he was hurt by strategic voting.
Nate_Cohn	717592357240221696	2016-04-06T05:58:44	This is basically what may have happened tonight 
Nate_Cohn	717591955132325889	2016-04-06T05:57:08	Also an important point. Cruz won 29% of moderates to 28 for Kasich! Cruz was at 15/12 in IL/MI 
Nate_Cohn	717591565489860608	2016-04-06T05:55:36	Cruz gained enough in the early March to get in striking distance of denying Trump 1237. Adding what's left of Rubio would get him there
Nate_Cohn	717591292667162624	2016-04-06T05:54:31	You don't need to re-read something from 3 wks ago, but the last section gets at the potential meaning of tonight  
Nate_Cohn	717591025880068096	2016-04-06T05:53:27	Trump really didn't do any worse than I guessed. But Cruz outperformed by enough to think he really benefited from the end of Rubio
Nate_Cohn	717589275827695616	2016-04-06T05:46:30	Momentum vs. demographics: According to Nate_Cohn, Trump’s vote share is as expected   
Nate_Cohn	717542079598051328	2016-04-06T02:38:57	Struck by the narrowness of Cruz's strength. He's getting hammered in less populous northern and western areas 
Nate_Cohn	717541449085165568	2016-04-06T02:36:27	GOP turnout running well ahead of the Democrats, 542k to 466k
Nate_Cohn	717533620878065665	2016-04-06T02:05:21	Looks to me like Trump's ahead in both the 7th and 3rd congressional district. That would be worth 6 delegates.
Nate_Cohn	717530980530126848	2016-04-06T01:54:51	And, of course, even if he gets 57%--he still has to keep getting 57%, even in far more diverse, affluent states with closed primaries
Nate_Cohn	717530282388283393	2016-04-06T01:52:05	Sanders is at the point where he falls back, even while seeming to mae progress. He needs 57% of delegates merely to not fall further behind
Nate_Cohn	717527887675568129	2016-04-06T01:42:34	Actually, I take that back. GOP vote tally in Milwaukee looks about right.
Nate_Cohn	717527454336815104	2016-04-06T01:40:50	Clinton up by a bit in the early Milwaukee County returns, but based on Cruz &amp; similar support in Waukesha/Ozuakee, I'd guess that's suburbs

Nate_Cohn	715578771894636546	2016-03-31T16:37:28	There's nothing about Cruz's strength and Trump weakness in Wisconsin that suggests a change in the race. This is expected.
Nate_Cohn	715576878279573504	2016-03-31T16:29:57	xenocryptsite  not odd. it's a poll. they're noisy

Nate_Cohn	715390503143911424	2016-03-31T04:09:21	Based strictly on demographics--no home state bonus--Trump favored to break 45 in all of CT, NY, NJ
Nate_Cohn	715389583001722881	2016-03-31T04:05:42	Hard to reconcile this with results in Mass--still Trump's best state! Northeastern strength not a fluke 
Nate_Cohn	715332988968509440	2016-03-31T00:20:49	Chris Mathews appears to be a really good fit for interviewing Trump. I'm impressed

Nate_Cohn	715265890028285952	2016-03-30T19:54:11	That's what our model shows coming out of 3/15 (although the Rubio thing certainly looms) 
Nate_Cohn	715264709411340288	2016-03-30T19:49:30	The catch, though, is that he might do all of those things  
Nate_Cohn	715251084432957441	2016-03-30T18:55:21	Nate_Cohn every statement is a cry for help
Nate_Cohn	715249675159408640	2016-03-30T18:49:45	Imagine, for a moment, that Trump was trying to lose. How much differently would he act? 
Nate_Cohn	715236280737652741	2016-03-30T17:56:32	Hard to imagine Sanders losing Wisconsin if he can get a draw out of Milwaukee

Nate_Cohn	715210726122590208	2016-03-30T16:14:59	Wisconsin is Trump's second worst remaining state in our demographic model. On 3/15, I think it would have been Cruz 41, Trump 35, K 16, R 8
Nate_Cohn	715210466105102336	2016-03-30T16:13:57	A couple of Wisconsin thoughts before the Marquette poll comes out: 1/
Nate_Cohn	715188773466693632	2016-03-30T14:47:45	Good reporting and strikes me as even less plausible than Sanders earning a majority of pledged delegates 
Nate_Cohn	714984725702529025	2016-03-30T01:16:57	It's just incredible to me that the GOP front runner is an offshore balancer

Nate_Cohn	714893270434914304	2016-03-29T19:13:32	The beauty of aiming for 40% is that... it's basically what demographics say they should get 
Nate_Cohn	714892812714713088	2016-03-29T19:11:43	This Politico article on Sanders and New York is pretty bizarre. They're aiming for 40%?  
Nate_Cohn	714870960562769922	2016-03-29T17:44:53	Not necessarily more than the average outside of the South, though.

Nate_Cohn	714867268111478786	2016-03-29T17:30:12	Yeah, I'm genuinely curious. I really don't know.

Nate_Cohn	714865104429387777	2016-03-29T17:21:37	Nicholas_Warino true
Nate_Cohn	714864281142050818	2016-03-29T17:18:20	This map from July is still the core of why Sanders is on track to lose, despite big wins in western caucuses

Nate_Cohn	714840068356251648	2016-03-29T15:42:08	alexponikvar no. again, it's in the article
Nate_Cohn	714839100302434305	2016-03-29T15:38:17	alexponikvar see, for ex, Sanders doing better in FL panhandle than south GA/AL
Nate_Cohn	714839004869435392	2016-03-29T15:37:54	alexponikvar because then conservative registered Democrats who vote Republican in presidential elections would vote in the GOP primary

Nate_Cohn	714179179454054401	2016-03-27T19:55:59	A little unexpected: adding post-3/15 improved Clinton's remaining vote in this model. Helped her in closed primaries, many of those left

Nate_Cohn	713848566649856001	2016-03-26T22:02:15	Sanders has an early 77-23 lead in Washington. Closely following my Facebook newsfeed

Nate_Cohn	713800358510858240	2016-03-26T18:50:41	Sanders has won at least 58% in all of the completed precincts in Washington that I've seen so far
Nate_Cohn	713796999942967296	2016-03-26T18:37:21	Clinton's hawkish, corporate, establishment brand is a horrible fit for dovish, populist, anti-establishment Western progressives
Nate_Cohn	713796675102515200	2016-03-26T18:36:03	I  think one of the lessons of '16 is that Clinton caucus struggles in '08 weren't mainly because of disorganization 
Nate_Cohn	713794541690757120	2016-03-26T18:27:35	Sanders has roughly matched Obama '08 in western caucuses, and Obama won 68% in WA, 76% in HI and 75% in AK.

Nate_Cohn	712685284043829248	2016-03-23T16:59:47	JoshEsrick in most parts of the country, yes. not where the Dems are dixiecrats
Nate_Cohn	712685057110966272	2016-03-23T16:58:53	YeaYouRite m_koek see the clear state effect? 
Nate_Cohn	712684705296941056	2016-03-23T16:57:29	YeaYouRite m_koek you can see the same thing by looking at the huge undervote: large numbers of people voting O'Malley in No FL in protest
Nate_Cohn	712684561549791232	2016-03-23T16:56:55	YeaYouRite m_koek hence the significant attenuation in Clinton support when you cross from south GA into North FL
Nate_Cohn	712684444830687233	2016-03-23T16:56:27	YeaYouRite m_koek you clearly do not understand. In an open primary or states without party registration, conservatives can vote GOP
Nate_Cohn	712684283626819584	2016-03-23T16:55:48	YeaYouRite again, open is *good* for Clinton in a place w con Dems, since they can vote GOP . That said, home state doesn't hurt
Nate_Cohn	712683450881351680	2016-03-23T16:52:30	ot_ford an imperfect variable. i think she'll do  worse than that in SW PA
Nate_Cohn	712683292269477888	2016-03-23T16:51:52	YeaYouRite you're missing the point. she does worse in states with 1) conservative reg Dems; 2) rules that mean they vote in D primaries
Nate_Cohn	712682866556035072	2016-03-23T16:50:11	YeaYouRite no. it wasn't. it's semi-closed. Registered Dems can't vote in the Republican primary
Nate_Cohn	712682756296220673	2016-03-23T16:49:44	YeaYouRite no i'm not. it holds in LA and FL too! and NC! MS doesn't have party reg.
Nate_Cohn	712682466947936256	2016-03-23T16:48:35	YeaYouRite it's also why she did so much worse in NC than expected

Nate_Cohn	712681330782248960	2016-03-23T16:44:04	JordanMFitch beacuse in those states, the registered Democrats aren't "actual" Democrats. They're people who vote Republican
Nate_Cohn	712681119167086593	2016-03-23T16:43:14	YeaYouRite  in Florida, it probably helps Clinton overall, but still hurts her in the Panhandle (few people)
Nate_Cohn	712680665876004864	2016-03-23T16:41:26	YeaYouRite but the few closed contests that force conservatives into the Dem process, like Oklahoma, really help him
Nate_Cohn	712680558921256960	2016-03-23T16:41:00	YeaYouRite well it depends on the location. Outside of areas with large numbers of Dixiecrats, closed primaries hurt him.
Nate_Cohn	712680339219451904	2016-03-23T16:40:08	It's probably a penalty in western PA, too, but the variable I'm using isn't capturing it there. Need to switch to obama pct / registered D
Nate_Cohn	712679732085559297	2016-03-23T16:37:43	Closed/semi-closed primaries is a huge *penalty* for Clinton, where cons still reg D. See: OK/western NC/north FL

Nate_Cohn	712678466534006785	2016-03-23T16:32:42	Actually, Indiana is a hair closer in this estimate: Clinton 50.2-Sanders 49.8
Nate_Cohn	712678233074827265	2016-03-23T16:31:46	Yeah, this has Rhode Island at Sanders 50.3-Clinton 49.7 
Nate_Cohn	712676597795434496	2016-03-23T16:25:16	Here's a rough guess of what's left on Dem side. About 53% for Clinton here, but lots of strong Bernie turf in NW

Nate_Cohn	712532842413219841	2016-03-23T06:54:02	It's 3 AM and exactly what we thought would happen has happened (though maybe a larger c/t w in AZ).
Nate_Cohn	712531572503756800	2016-03-23T06:48:59	The Election Day vote in Maricopa County so far is Trump 50, Cruz 37, Kasich 11.
Nate_Cohn	712531207402229760	2016-03-23T06:47:32	This statement seems accurate, including three big wins this weekend in WA/HI/AK 
Nate_Cohn	712530572837523456	2016-03-23T06:45:01	Cruz result in Utah is consistent with roughly splitting the Rubio vote with Kasich, perhaps even a bit more
Nate_Cohn	712529706776674304	2016-03-23T06:41:34	Clinton has run a bit than she did in caucuses in 08, but Utah switching from a primary to a caucus probably just cost her what she gained
Nate_Cohn	712526348590428161	2016-03-23T06:28:14	Idaho goes for Bernie. He wins 78% of the vote, could easily be his biggest win outside of VT of the cycle. AK is best competition
Nate_Cohn	712523306172354560	2016-03-23T06:16:08	YeaYouRite alexponikvar probably not. (and the only two caucuses that don't report raw votes = the ones that voted for clinton)
Nate_Cohn	712513257551052801	2016-03-23T05:36:13	Tonight's one of the best nights for Sanders, and he still might not get the 60-40 split he needs to catch up to Clinton over second half
Nate_Cohn	712512858882498561	2016-03-23T05:34:38	Sanders wins Boise's Ada County by an 80-20 margin. County was &gt;1/3 of all Dem votes in '08 
Nate_Cohn	712512401636200449	2016-03-23T05:32:49	AP projects Sanders win in Utah. He's up 3-1 so far, it could be around enough to cancel Clinton's delegate haul in Arizona
Nate_Cohn	712506995962720256	2016-03-23T05:11:20	Carbon County, UT--could be one of Clinton's best--is Sanders 48, Clinton 45 with 100% reporting
Nate_Cohn	712506067964588032	2016-03-23T05:07:38	Initial results in Utah: Cruz 62, Trump 23, Kasich 15 (2% reporting)
Nate_Cohn	712501675806695425	2016-03-23T04:50:11	A Clinton supporter in Seattle thinks it's time for Sanders to face reality on the delegate math 
Nate_Cohn	712498818567290880	2016-03-23T04:38:50	ElectProject it's too small to be unrepresentative for that sort of thing. Trump also has 57 in the Eday vote. Doubt that.
Nate_Cohn	712497568027176960	2016-03-23T04:33:52	Rubio won 17% of the early vote in Maricopa County. He has 0.4% of the vote in the 12,400 Election Day votes counted so far.

Nate_Cohn	710191420074754049	2016-03-16T19:50:03	Notice, for instance, the discontiuity along state lines of Oklahoma, FL panhandle, LA, NC. Sanders tends to outperform in same areas.
Nate_Cohn	710191116839161858	2016-03-16T19:48:51	Lots of registered Democrats voting for neither Clinton nor Sanders in conservative areas with closed contests 
Nate_Cohn	710182333798871040	2016-03-16T19:13:57	shundle  decent data would have told him that no additional effort was required to pull that off

Nate_Cohn	710170622463184896	2016-03-16T18:27:25	ForecasterEnten not like it matters though, since the super delegates rigged it from the start.
Nate_Cohn	710170532021411840	2016-03-16T18:27:03	ForecasterEnten whoa if true
Nate_Cohn	710169649485357056	2016-03-16T18:23:33	By my count, Clinton leads by a 58-40 margin in the Democratic popular vote, 8.5 million to 5.9 million. ~the same as delegate margin.
Nate_Cohn	710159830460182529	2016-03-16T17:44:32	Clinton's odds of becoming president have never been better. She's got the nom, Obama approval up, pbly faces Trump 
Nate_Cohn	710150627687538688	2016-03-16T17:07:58	AntBejarano looks like a party registration effect to me
Nate_Cohn	710150013297496070	2016-03-16T17:05:31	Clinton's 5 state sweep looks good, but her del lead is basically the same as if she lost all 3 MW states but met poll expectations in NC
Nate_Cohn	710135750629568512	2016-03-16T16:08:51	Nate_Cohn Even if the party is officially fighting Trump they appear to be using Trumpist reasoning on this.
Nate_Cohn	710135418755399680	2016-03-16T16:07:32	The Republican plan to let Clinton choose the next Supreme Court Justice with a Democratic Senate is going better than they ever hoped
Nate_Cohn	710132813970972672	2016-03-16T15:57:11	Last night shows how Trump can win a majority of delegates: ~40% of the vote over a split field 
Nate_Cohn	709977838150148096	2016-03-16T05:41:22	AlecMacGillis that's an interesting theory for why clinton voters might be less likely to crossover for kasich in OH than MI
Nate_Cohn	709972274066100225	2016-03-16T05:19:15	Nate_Cohn This is only one slice, but I was struck today by how motivated OH teachers still were, post SB5, against Kasich and pro-Hillary.
Nate_Cohn	709976633453711361	2016-03-16T05:36:34	The results tonight show how Trump could win a majority of delegates by prevailing over a split field in blue states 
Nate_Cohn	709974418878042113	2016-03-16T05:27:46	Redistrict this is so good
Nate_Cohn	709974179517485056	2016-03-16T05:26:49	This is big: Trump voters' aversion to candidates w/ foreign-sounding names cost him at least 2 delegates. Example: 
Nate_Cohn	709973743788015617	2016-03-16T05:25:05	So far, I've found two clear examples where a foreign-sounding name cost Trump at least 1 delegate: IL13 &amp; IL06. 
Nate_Cohn	709972933456875521	2016-03-16T05:21:52	Redistrict do you think it cost him any delegates
Nate_Cohn	709972592464109568	2016-03-16T05:20:31	In the Illinois loophole primary, there is rampant evidence Trump supporters gave fewer votes to Trump delegates w/ foreign-sounding names.
Nate_Cohn	709968612401008644	2016-03-16T05:04:42	Nate_Cohn he gave a 60 minute speech in Phoenix that only mentioned Clinton twice and didn't refer at all to today's votes.
Nate_Cohn	709968695414681600	2016-03-16T05:05:02	If someone wants to explain why Clinton did so well in Ohio but not IL or Missouri, I'm all ears
Nate_Cohn	709968469073199104	2016-03-16T05:04:08	Did Bernie say anything tonight?
Nate_Cohn	709966893982085120	2016-03-16T04:57:52	Not like it matters, but it would help Sanders in WV, KY, western PA
Nate_Cohn	709966703468404736	2016-03-16T04:57:07	The discontinuity along states with party reg in the South (OK, NC, FL) in white Dixiecrat land is striking 
Nate_Cohn	709965607970738177	2016-03-16T04:52:46	Pretty incredible: the turnout for the GOP primary in Ohio swamped the Democratic turnout by nearly a 2-1 margin.
Nate_Cohn	709965253497495552	2016-03-16T04:51:21	He certainly would if we rolled the results from tonight forward
Nate_Cohn	709965210732392448	2016-03-16T04:51:11	I don't understand these tweets about how we're definitely going to a contested convention. Trump could definitely get a majority
Nate_Cohn	709963981822283780	2016-03-16T04:46:18	A huge night for Clinton. It gives her near insurmountable delegate edge AND she gets Trump/Cruz as likely opponent  
Nate_Cohn	709963176209731584	2016-03-16T04:43:06	Clinton goes ahead in the AP count by 1,199 votes with 99% counted. A few precincts left in Jackson County, where Clinton leads
Nate_Cohn	709962364817448960	2016-03-16T04:39:52	The county results show her winning St. Louis County by 19k. She's up by 15k in the AP count. Would be enough to overcome Sanders' lead
Nate_Cohn	709962161641095168	2016-03-16T04:39:04	Clinton appears to take the lead in Missouri after St. Louis County finishes its county. A Missouri win would make her 5-for-5 tonight.
Nate_Cohn	709959208016420864	2016-03-16T04:27:20	St. Louis City appears to be done--closes Sanders' lead to 2,000 votes, with fragmentary stuff left in St. Louis County and Jackson County
Nate_Cohn	709955439748915201	2016-03-16T04:12:21	mattmfm but that check mark....
Nate_Cohn	709955011690827776	2016-03-16T04:10:39	A lot of vote still left in St. Louis City. Clinton could easily pull it out.
Nate_Cohn	709954871412330496	2016-03-16T04:10:06	Sanders lead down to 5,000 votes in Missouri after new votes from St. Louis County (not StL City, which is different).

Nate_Cohn	709942260532682754	2016-03-16T03:19:59	I'm not sure that I buy that this is all of St. Louis City. 29k Democratic votes is ... too low.
Nate_Cohn	709941457763876864	2016-03-16T03:16:48	Between her own wins and the possibility of facing Trump/Cruz, tonight could not have gone much better for Clinton 
Nate_Cohn	709938663988142084	2016-03-16T03:05:42	Nate_Cohn I haven't gone in depth on it, but it looks like Cruz could win IL18, and Kasich is very close in IL05. Beyond that, not sure.
Nate_Cohn	709938208394625028	2016-03-16T03:03:53	.Redistrict do you have him losing an IL CD?
Nate_Cohn	709936912191119360	2016-03-16T02:58:44	Cruz has fought Trump to a draw, but he exhausted his base in the Ozarks to do it. He now needs to outperform a bit in the St. Louis/KC area
Nate_Cohn	709933204090843136	2016-03-16T02:44:00	wccubbison you sure about those numbers
Nate_Cohn	709927525565206528	2016-03-16T02:21:26	O'Malley got 2.3% in FL &amp; dramatically over-performed as a protest vote in conservative dem regions flapol sayfie 
Nate_Cohn	709927488256909312	2016-03-16T02:21:17	The Upshot models, you'll note, aren't totally buying it. Think she only wins the outstanding vote there 55-45 
Nate_Cohn	709927274288648192	2016-03-16T02:20:26	Clinton with an early 58-40 lead in KC's Jackson cty. That type of margin there and in StL would be enough to put her over the top.
Nate_Cohn	709924459088576512	2016-03-16T02:09:15	I'd say Trump slightly favored on assumption he'll win the St. Louis area, but not much in yet.  
Nate_Cohn	709922845107884032	2016-03-16T02:02:50	Missouri could not be closer. Clinton margins in St. Louis and/or Kansas will decide it. 
Nate_Cohn	709918640053866496	2016-03-16T01:46:08	Trump winning IL big with the same share of vote in NC/MO, since Cruz is so weak in blue states. Big Trump asset in 2nd half of primaries.
Nate_Cohn	709914698058223617	2016-03-16T01:30:28	"We are gonna go all the way to Cleveland and secure the Republican nomination," says Kasich, on a stage 15 miles from Cleveland.
Nate_Cohn	709914528625074176	2016-03-16T01:29:47	karpmj but why
Nate_Cohn	709913213291380736	2016-03-16T01:24:34	So who has the theory about why Clinton did so much better in Northwest Ohio than rural Michigan?
Nate_Cohn	709912467393159169	2016-03-16T01:21:36	The catch, of course, is that her failure to do so in Chicago/Detroit suggests that she's by no means guaranteed to do so
Nate_Cohn	709912175725449216	2016-03-16T01:20:26	The results from the few reported areas of rural MO do not make it seem like Sanders can survive a big C margin in StL/KC, if she wins one
Nate_Cohn	709909473704468480	2016-03-16T01:09:42	PeteMcPartland funny you ask!
Nate_Cohn	709908924175142912	2016-03-16T01:07:31	It'll be interesting to see whether Clinton can pad her--so far weak--margin in Cook with strength in collar counties. She may need to

Nate_Cohn	709903177856983040	2016-03-16T00:44:41	Well one thing we appear to be learning tonight is that Clinton does pretty well in the early/absentee vote
Nate_Cohn	709901008370049024	2016-03-16T00:36:04	aaron_strauss they're pretty heavily contaminated by early votes. not that reliable at this point
Nate_Cohn	709900351948910594	2016-03-16T00:33:27	One nice thing about Illinois is that Cook County counts fast enough taht we don't have stay up waiting for Detroit until midnight
Nate_Cohn	709900145345875972	2016-03-16T00:32:38	Clinton's lead in Wake County--the one place where there's significant Election Day vote--has slipped as votes get counted
Nate_Cohn	709898324002869249	2016-03-16T00:25:24	The early vote in Ohio was pretty old. In Franklin County, for instance, 46% were ages 65 and over. Clinton can't keep these margins up
Nate_Cohn	709889612790042624	2016-03-15T23:50:47	There are a few places in FL where the election day vote has largely come in. Both Clinton and Trump slip a little, not much. Big W for both
Nate_Cohn	709887845540995073	2016-03-15T23:43:46	Clinton's up by 30 pts in North Carolina in the early vote, 36 pts in FL. If it held, that would cancel all of Sanders' wins this year.
Nate_Cohn	709884794382000128	2016-03-15T23:31:38	Clinton could net 60+ delegates out of Florida at this rate, increasing her overall delegate lead by 30%
Nate_Cohn	709884558712377344	2016-03-15T23:30:42	We'll see how much Sanders caught up on Election Day, but the delegate consequences of a 30 pt rout in Florida, 3rd largest state, are huge
Nate_Cohn	709882371978498049	2016-03-15T23:22:01	Clinton wins the Miami-Dade early vote 80-19. Wins Broward 75-24. This is a rout.

Nate_Cohn	709860379590041606	2016-03-15T21:54:37	76% of Democratic voters today see Clinton's policies as realistic, versus 56% for Sanders:  
Nate_Cohn	709856547967524864	2016-03-15T21:39:24	Intuitively, it makes 100% sense to me that the "stop Trump" D vote would hurt Clinton, but there's basically no evidence either way
Nate_Cohn	709853672214294531	2016-03-15T21:27:58	mwisnefske they usually do when &gt;20% of vote is early. NC would count. not sure if that's actually the case or not. very expensive
Nate_Cohn	709851919007784960	2016-03-15T21:21:00	I'd be pretty surprised if the NC number proved to be this low, given the early vote 
Nate_Cohn	709851587246735360	2016-03-15T21:19:41	By contrast, just 1% of NC GOP voters are Dems, and just 3% of FL GOP voters (closed primary) are Dems

Nate_Cohn	709771153364164608	2016-03-15T16:00:04	The catch, though, is that many of these vtrs voted in the 2012 R primary, so the crossover may have been Rs for '08, not Ds for 16
Nate_Cohn	709770829601570816	2016-03-15T15:58:47	That's mainly because 17% of GOP requests came from voters who participated in the 2008 Democratic primary.

Nate_Cohn	707286529329242112	2016-03-08T19:27:03	.goldietaylor i just mean that there's no advantage for either candidate based on the state's demographics. maybe "fair" is the wrong word

Nate_Cohn	706887776696926208	2016-03-07T17:02:33	Serious question: would Trump rather keep Kasich in the race and maintain a 3-way contest, or would he rather win Ohio's delegates?

Nate_Cohn	706300620488060928	2016-03-06T02:09:25	Actually, that's not a good analogy. Sanders falls further behind by not scoring more in these states. He took time off clock, as well
Nate_Cohn	706300332469411843	2016-03-06T02:08:16	For Sanders, a 10 pt win in NE is like kicking a field goal late in the 4th when you're down by several touchdowns

Nate_Cohn	706263010642403333	2016-03-05T23:39:58	Results from Knox County, ME, where Trump narrowly won. 
Nate_Cohn	706262074914115584	2016-03-05T23:36:15	I know there are caveats - tiny turnout, semi-closed caucus state, etc. - but Cruz winning in Maine would be damned impressive
Nate_Cohn	706261051377987584	2016-03-05T23:32:11	Hmm, hadn't really thought about this, but yeah, I think Kasich-Trump-Cruz is a decent way to deny T a majority 
Nate_Cohn	706257200243605506	2016-03-05T23:16:52	I'm not sure whether horrible nights for Rubio and great nights for Cruz are terrible for Trump
Nate_Cohn	706255136746635266	2016-03-05T23:08:40	Stating that everyone expected Cruz to do what he just did in KS is revisionism of the highest order. No one expected these results.

Nate_Cohn	706228569450545152	2016-03-05T21:23:06	Per a Maine source, results of Portland, ME area caucus: Cruz 540, Trump 495, Kasich 29, Rubio 169.
Nate_Cohn	706228292278333440	2016-03-05T21:22:00	Kansas looked like one of Trump's worst states 
Nate_Cohn	706228066691878913	2016-03-05T21:21:06	Trump's share of the vote by CD in Kansas is a little low, but near what you'd expect based on the race so far. Cruz numbers are way high

Nate_Cohn	706213046981505024	2016-03-05T20:21:25	Nate_Cohn you might find this of interest, Google searches for Rubio relative to Kasich and Cruz have gone down 
Nate_Cohn	706213208957190144	2016-03-05T20:22:04	.MABlumenfeld yeah but Kasich is running even or ahead of Rubio in rural areas in initial returns. not how it was on Super Tues.
Nate_Cohn	706212851476660225	2016-03-05T20:20:39	I know we don't have much in today, but the fragmentary results hint at the possibility that Kasich/Cruz are eating into Rubio on both sides
Nate_Cohn	706212348940259328	2016-03-05T20:18:39	Fragmentary returns from rural KS look good for Cruz. Should be his best part of state

Nate_Cohn	705867880592707584	2016-03-04T21:29:51	@PittsBern she should win ohio
Nate_Cohn	705867673792614401	2016-03-04T21:29:02	@PittsBern wv, ky too, perhaps. maybe sd. she still wins easy
Nate_Cohn	705867503910719490	2016-03-04T21:28:21	@PittsBern she'll probably also lose nebraska, alaska, utah, montana, idaho, nd, maine, washington, oregon, wisconsin. maybe rhode island

Nate_Cohn	705786890545438721	2016-03-04T16:08:02	I have not included a Walker/Ryan variable :)

Nate_Cohn	705786523636072449	2016-03-04T16:06:34	PatrickRuffini WI changes if you eliminate "Catholic" as a variable. It'll be close.
Nate_Cohn	705785790144651266	2016-03-04T16:03:39	In any case, they're three of the closest states and it's not very important from a delegate stand point  
Nate_Cohn	705785297691418624	2016-03-04T16:01:42	I'd agree if they were caucuses / if we learned that caucuses hurt Trump less than currently looks 
Nate_Cohn	705783419318435841	2016-03-04T15:54:14	There's a catch, though. It wouldn't take much to put Trump under 50% delegates. Rubio+Kasich vt would do it

Nate_Cohn	703747740359065600	2016-02-28T01:05:10	The basic problem for Sanders is this: where is he going to win by enough to compensate for getting annihilated in the South?

Nate_Cohn	703233703355486208	2016-02-26T15:02:34	My latest: How those claims about the economic effects of Sanders' platform  was based on bad math (or bad logic). 
Nate_Cohn	703277413820715009	2016-02-26T17:56:16	Based on the results so far, here's a guess of where Trump might fare best. New Jersey's great for him 
Nate_Cohn	703276412556410880	2016-02-26T17:52:17	I guess Christie was serious about hating Senators
Nate_Cohn	703276051582066689	2016-02-26T17:50:51	New Jersey is one of Trump's best states, based on the results so far
Nate_Cohn	703275753962643456	2016-02-26T17:49:40	Wow
Nate_Cohn	703262645537734656	2016-02-26T16:57:35	As socialist Nate_Cohn suggests, Trump should pull out of Texas, focus on Virginia, then go all in on Florida. chocker

Nate_Cohn	703256940995022852	2016-02-26T16:34:55	jimtankersley yeah
Nate_Cohn	703256874569867264	2016-02-26T16:34:39	KevinQ jimtankersley I also think there's a fun case for Rubio to tell his supporters to vote for Kasich in Ohio
Nate_Cohn	703256425632497666	2016-02-26T16:32:52	Yes, I think he should want to lose Texas, focus on VA 
Nate_Cohn	703255829768757249	2016-02-26T16:30:30	I had Carson pulling a solid 7 delegates and Kasich at 19 
Nate_Cohn	703255358853275652	2016-02-26T16:28:38	YeaYouRite the rules are totally different. rubio would be in huge trouble with dem rules.

Nate_Cohn	703243128917127169	2016-02-26T15:40:02	JudgeNathan i agree that his challenge is winning. i'm just saying delegate math isn't the problem
Nate_Cohn	703242543668985858	2016-02-26T15:37:42	This interactive is a triumph. Amazing.  
Nate_Cohn	703240172356263936	2016-02-26T15:28:17	Yet another jaw-dropping interactive viz from nytgraphics -- exploring the path to a Trump nomination. 
Nate_Cohn	703241395537108992	2016-02-26T15:33:08	electionsmith  fascinating
Nate_Cohn	703240614096347136	2016-02-26T15:30:02	.ThePlumLineGS yeah definitely. if he stays, there's a fun argument Rubio should tell his voters to support Kasich
Nate_Cohn	703239587557187585	2016-02-26T15:25:57	I no longer have a face, because it melted.  OMG driven_by_data jshkatz larrybuch Nate_Cohn are my new bicycle.

Nate_Cohn	703239021602979840	2016-02-26T15:23:42	rjt686 we'll find out
Nate_Cohn	703238268964499456	2016-02-26T15:20:43	ThePlumLineGS yeah, you have to win the 3/15 and later period. If you want to finish w a maj, you need to do ~Romney '12
Nate_Cohn	703237510026174464	2016-02-26T15:17:42	Winning is the challenge. It's not the delegate hole from 3/1, which really can just be erased by FL
Nate_Cohn	703237290827649024	2016-02-26T15:16:50	Look, the most important thing about the GOP rules is that they're biased towards cands who win after 3/15. If you win then after, you win.
Nate_Cohn	703233281026752512	2016-02-26T15:00:54	mlow29 Sharpe222 barely matters
Nate_Cohn	703225944090103808	2016-02-26T14:31:45	The math checks out: Rubio really can lose every Super Tuesday state and win. The problem is winning 3/15, not math 
Nate_Cohn	703072578823442432	2016-02-26T04:22:19	What's the probability of Donald J. Trump becoming the Republican nominee for president?
Nate_Cohn	703057440519155712	2016-02-26T03:22:10	Carson is on pace to receive a far greater share of speaking time than Super Tuesday delegates
Nate_Cohn	703045841133641728	2016-02-26T02:36:05	Trump defends the absurd position that you can get pre-existing condition coverage without a mandate... like Obama in 2008.
Nate_Cohn	703044901953376256	2016-02-26T02:32:21	¯\_(ツ)_/¯ GOPDebate 
Nate_Cohn	703044775025451008	2016-02-26T02:31:50	I'm sure Trump's "i like Planned Parenthood" reply was reassuring to conservatives on the Supreme Court issue
Nate_Cohn	703042587201019906	2016-02-26T02:23:09	They pulled out a tee and set the ball on it 
Nate_Cohn	703042402160910340	2016-02-26T02:22:25	Trump, of course, really does trail by massive margins among Hispanic voters
Nate_Cohn	703039744821891072	2016-02-26T02:11:51	I mean, I'm sure it took 1000s of coders working 24 hours a day to make the upgrade, but he's passing Turing now 
Nate_Cohn	703039197205176320	2016-02-26T02:09:41	The new Rubio "attack" package is pretty good.
Nate_Cohn	703037840058359808	2016-02-26T02:04:17	"Mexico will pay for it because they're not doing us any favors"

Nate_Cohn	703034843240779776	2016-02-26T01:52:23	Did Trump try and defend self-deportation there or did I misunderstand?
Nate_Cohn	703032833401556992	2016-02-26T01:44:23	Young people, you too can get 19 or 20 delegates out of more than 600 on Super Tuesday.
Nate_Cohn	703032625108262912	2016-02-26T01:43:34	We waited soo long for the debate to start and we get Carson first
Nate_Cohn	703031145420693504	2016-02-26T01:37:41	The "this is not a sporting event" intro feels a bit off when it's followed by the national anthem
Nate_Cohn	702967683206217729	2016-02-25T21:25:30	We have a resource allocation issue  $40M+ for IA, $50M+ NH, $25M+ SC &lt;$10M for March 1 $0 for anti-Trump efforts $50M to SuperPACs refunded
Nate_Cohn	703008395075395584	2016-02-26T00:07:17	Clearly a Star Destroyer buried under there 
Nate_Cohn	702998960726745092	2016-02-25T23:29:47	DCCyclone conorsen this has trump up 7 there
Nate_Cohn	702991467392983041	2016-02-25T23:00:01	And to be clear, that's if he still loses 3/15. Not if he wins 3/15
Nate_Cohn	702991390813327360	2016-02-25T22:59:43	He can't win a majority of delegates. But if he won by say 3 he could deny Trump a maj.  Much more = wins plurality 
Nate_Cohn	702990899844947968	2016-02-25T22:57:46	stevesingiser jbarro haha, fair, but i'm not going to psychoanalyze one guy to figure out what he'll do once he's lost. who knows
Nate_Cohn	702990470583033856	2016-02-25T22:56:03	stevesingiser jbarro i think if he's taking third to rubio in states like al/tn/ar/ga/va/ok that the writing is on the wall
Nate_Cohn	702989796554240000	2016-02-25T22:53:23	BretttJackson jbarro no. the opposite
Nate_Cohn	702989558535868417	2016-02-25T22:52:26	jbarro stevesingiser if that's right, and, again, i make no claim to knowing what he'll do, then trump wins
Nate_Cohn	702989483160039429	2016-02-25T22:52:08	stevesingiser jbarro those are states that are very good for a conservative/evangelical candidate
Nate_Cohn	702989381666271236	2016-02-25T22:51:44	stevesingiser jbarro no, that's not what i said. come on. i said that's evidence he's fallen behind rubio
Nate_Cohn	702989299101396993	2016-02-25T22:51:24	stevesingiser jbarro but i'll concede that if cruz is in second that it's harder to imagine him leaving. maybe TX gets him there
Nate_Cohn	702989098206814208	2016-02-25T22:50:36	stevesingiser jbarro super tuesday is by far the best day for his coalition of the entire race. it's all downhill
Nate_Cohn	702989026500943872	2016-02-25T22:50:19	stevesingiser jbarro i think nv/sc = the best evidence that Rubio &gt; cruz.
Nate_Cohn	702988000330956800	2016-02-25T22:46:14	jbarro maybe. i just think it's hard to predict the behavior of individual people and both cruz/kasich will have clearly lost
Nate_Cohn	702987560398811136	2016-02-25T22:44:29	jbarro sorry cruz/kasich
Nate_Cohn	702987540517810176	2016-02-25T22:44:25	jbarro i'm agnostic on that. i have no idea when trump/kasich get out. could be 3/8
Nate_Cohn	702987344635367424	2016-02-25T22:43:38	jbarro not really
Nate_Cohn	702983334201270272	2016-02-25T22:27:42	JoshuaGreen ForecasterEnten the CW, as I read it, is that Trump is unstoppable and already won
Nate_Cohn	702982100018978816	2016-02-25T22:22:48	Am I reading the same Bloomberg poll as some people? The idea that Rubio picks up vast majority of non-Trump's support is validated...
Nate_Cohn	702981442809241600	2016-02-25T22:20:11	Most of the southern states look better for Trump than the US (no TX home st. adjust makes Rubio stronger than is) 
Nate_Cohn	702979966900772864	2016-02-25T22:14:19	In 7 southern states, several of which look particularly good for Trump 
Nate_Cohn	702979257815965696	2016-02-25T22:11:30	Trump leads Rubio by 4 in a one-on-one match-up in TX, VA, GA, TN, AR, OK, GA. 
Nate_Cohn	702952363238301696	2016-02-25T20:24:38	Farmers4Bernie these WI/OH/PA/MI numbers don't look great on that front
Nate_Cohn	702941400254574592	2016-02-25T19:41:04	It's hard for VA to be bad for Rubio given the result in South Carolina--unless he's actually lost ground since
Nate_Cohn	702941285729046528	2016-02-25T19:40:37	aaron_strauss true in SC too, no?

Nate_Cohn	702940375846146049	2016-02-25T19:37:00	Virginia ought to be one of Rubio's best states (along with MN), based on first 4 states (no home st adjust. TX/FL)

Nate_Cohn	701915066057281536	2016-02-22T23:42:47	There are basically two "smoking guns" in the entrance poll: implausibly young Hisp. vt, just 5pt C edge in Clark

Nate_Cohn	701913192461688833	2016-02-22T23:35:20	It implies that turnout among young Hispanic voters exceeded turnout among those over age 30, despite long record of low young Hisp. turnout

Nate_Cohn	701889827898310657	2016-02-22T22:02:30	seanmdav i'd guess a high percentage, given the overall turnout (180k) v. GOP vt in 12 (730k), or the 14 primary
Nate_Cohn	701888405966352385	2016-02-22T21:56:51	seanmdav but they probably are voters who the GOP already wins in presidential or midterm elections

Nate_Cohn	701493098468286466	2016-02-21T19:46:02	politicswthsoul I'd "err" on the side of Clinton. Hard to say that's too definitive
Nate_Cohn	701493037940269056	2016-02-21T19:45:48	politicswthsoul But the finding that Mr. Sanders won the Hispanic vote is at best extremely questionable — and, at worst, wrong.
Nate_Cohn	701492207879122944	2016-02-21T19:42:30	Seems like a big stretch given IA/NV

Nate_Cohn	701491984544960516	2016-02-21T19:41:36	LAKossack Obama won 66% of the vote. Tough to top that

Nate_Cohn	701491346679406593	2016-02-21T19:39:04	GR20393 Obama won 80% there. Tough to top that

Nate_Cohn	701182882535104512	2016-02-20T23:13:21	The exit poll currently shows Clinton ahead by just 5 in Clark County. She currently leads by 10. 
Nate_Cohn	701180100897849345	2016-02-20T23:02:18	In the category of totally irrelevant: I don't see the 5th unanimous black precinct for Clinton. 
Nate_Cohn	701178835337920514	2016-02-20T22:57:16	A sixth majority black precinct narrows Clinton's lead among black voters to... 96 to 7 delegates
Nate_Cohn	701175604301922304	2016-02-20T22:44:25	The updated exit poll gives Clinton a massive 76-22 lead among black voters.
Nate_Cohn	701171787795660801	2016-02-20T22:29:16	The area in this triangle shaped like "&lt;" is majority Hispanic. Mainly Clinton. 
Nate_Cohn	701170210116599808	2016-02-20T22:22:59	In 5 majority black precincts, Clinton has an 84 to 4 delegate lead over Sanders.
Nate_Cohn	701167543390756864	2016-02-20T22:12:24	And as a general rule, I have big reservations about the ability of exit polls to measure a group like Hispanic voters, let alone w small n
Nate_Cohn	701167317900775425	2016-02-20T22:11:30	Based on the results in Clark, the precincts in ELV, and the overall entrance poll error, I do not believe Sanders won the Hispanic vote.
Nate_Cohn	701166947837280257	2016-02-20T22:10:02	In the end, Clinton probably stretches this out to a 6 point lead. 
Nate_Cohn	701165101060136961	2016-02-20T22:02:41	It's hard to look at the precincts left in Clark County and conclude that the votes so far have been biased Clinton 
Nate_Cohn	701164559923617794	2016-02-20T22:00:32	The majority Hispanic precincts in east Las Vegas generally look good for Clinton, contra exit polls. 
Nate_Cohn	701163867401883650	2016-02-20T21:57:47	For a good perspective on where the vote is and should end up, this is the best media site. 
Nate_Cohn	701163122585899009	2016-02-20T21:54:50	Our models have stubbornly pointed to a modest Clinton lead  
Nate_Cohn	701161106077782017	2016-02-20T21:46:49	We have Clinton almost exactly matching her performance from 2008. A lot of Clark left.  
Nate_Cohn	701160051369779202	2016-02-20T21:42:37	Clinton is dominating Sanders, 50 to 4, in the three precincts that look majority black to me.
Nate_Cohn	701159593574064133	2016-02-20T21:40:48	Our models show an '08 repeat  
Nate_Cohn	701159394940071936	2016-02-20T21:40:01	It's incredible just how much the results look like they did in 08. 
Nate_Cohn	701158061432504320	2016-02-20T21:34:43	Our estimates are volatile, but they show Clinton ahead bc of Clark County  
Nate_Cohn	701152720137408512	2016-02-20T21:13:29	Clinton appears to have taken a tiny lead in the newest entrance poll data. Women now up to 56% of the electorate.
Nate_Cohn	701152182096285698	2016-02-20T21:11:21	Sanders-Clinton tied in early returns, but many northern rural counties--Sanders country--have reported a lot of vote.
Nate_Cohn	701151004797050882	2016-02-20T21:06:40	(3 of 11 plurality Hispanic precincts, to be clear)
Nate_Cohn	701150946043289601	2016-02-20T21:06:26	That's how you get crazy things like Bush 44% w Hisp in '04. Just by chance, 3/11 precincts in national exit poll were Miami-Dade County
Nate_Cohn	701150838320996353	2016-02-20T21:06:01	Remember how exit polls work: random sample of precincts. Really hard to measure segregated groups, like Hisp., w that approach
Nate_Cohn	701150354398904320	2016-02-20T21:04:05	TheStalwart yup.
Nate_Cohn	701150304226643968	2016-02-20T21:03:53	Perhaps some tension btwn Sanders entrance poll lead in cities and Hispanic voters, and big Clinton sweep along the strip. We'll see

Nate_Cohn	701147175665999873	2016-02-20T20:51:28	YeaYouRite just as Obama could have argued in '08
Nate_Cohn	701147131395108865	2016-02-20T20:51:17	YeaYouRite my pt is that it's still better than the USA for Sanders if Clinton's strength is concentrated among black vtrs
Nate_Cohn	701146991858995206	2016-02-20T20:50:44	conorsen why you might get that at some point.
Nate_Cohn	701145924400242689	2016-02-20T20:46:29	(since the state has a below avg number of black voters)
Nate_Cohn	701145844637179905	2016-02-20T20:46:10	Weird tension tonight: better Sanders does with Hispanic vt, more Clinton can argue state didn't capture strength 
Nate_Cohn	701143609521872896	2016-02-20T20:37:17	Split between Hispanic and nonwhite vtrs implies Clinton &gt;60% w black/Asian voters in fragmentary data 
Nate_Cohn	701142103523459074	2016-02-20T20:31:18	New (still small) entrance poll is just 53% female. Would be surprising. NV Dems are 57% female.

Nate_Cohn	701135715757907968	2016-02-20T20:05:55	Let's also keep in mind that the sample on this entrance poll appears to be 379 so far, according to CBS page
Nate_Cohn	701134910552199168	2016-02-20T20:02:43	Sanders folks have to like this from the early entrance polls... 
Nate_Cohn	701134596172345347	2016-02-20T20:01:28	Early entrance polls seem to show Clinton ahead but, though early entrance polls understated Sanders in IA by a lot 
Nate_Cohn	701133168016027648	2016-02-20T19:55:48	MSNBC is talking to an undecided voter who is not even sure why she's undecided. Amazing.

Nate_Cohn	701119061212717057	2016-02-20T18:59:45	Key point about NV-D caucus: the electorate is not unusually diverse, even though it's the 6th most diverse state 
Nate_Cohn	701116775723876352	2016-02-20T18:50:40	Fastest-rising Google search in South Carolina about Donald Trump is "trump quits."  Is Cruz robo-calling this?
Nate_Cohn	701114260932329472	2016-02-20T18:40:40	will be hilarious when Cruz becomes president after convincing millions of people that Hillary Clinton is quitting the race on election day

Nate_Cohn	696086237111721984	2016-02-06T21:41:06	davidshor do gender/race not predict sexism/racism measures?
Nate_Cohn	696079004386725889	2016-02-06T21:12:21	DanaHoule no. it's not. Q is RVs, not LVs.  among RVs, it's almost much lower than 37
Nate_Cohn	696078819061473280	2016-02-06T21:11:37	DanaHoule if you made me guess, i'd say overreport bias might be among less educ/southern black vtrs. but we're not talking a big n
Nate_Cohn	696078677348487169	2016-02-06T21:11:03	DanaHoule we *know* non-response bias in the exits/polls is towards more educ. they know it. overreport vt bias is dif. we dk that well
Nate_Cohn	696078207544483840	2016-02-06T21:09:11	DanaHoule in the end, whether the CPS is perfect isn't the point. most polls are weighted to the Census for adult pop. Q isn't an outlier.
Nate_Cohn	696077600968429568	2016-02-06T21:06:47	DanaHoule how big is it? that's just speculation. but it's just not a key part of the convo
Nate_Cohn	696077525101883392	2016-02-06T21:06:29	DanaHoule the exits literally are not capable of correcting for nonresponse. we *know* it's a massive issue. they know it's an issue
Nate_Cohn	696077415051763712	2016-02-06T21:06:02	DanaHoule sure it is. the cps says it's like an 82% turnout among BAs? You sure it's not 77?
Nate_Cohn	696077334382706688	2016-02-06T21:05:43	DanaHoule what i said at the beginning is still true: pbly a little low, not an outlier. whether the polls are right? we'll never be sure
Nate_Cohn	696077175565332480	2016-02-06T21:05:05	DanaHoule or maybe it's perfect? you just don't know
Nate_Cohn	696077014701223936	2016-02-06T21:04:27	DanaHoule ultimately, the imperfections of the CPS could go either way. it could even be less educated. could be more. idk
Nate_Cohn	696076821687697408	2016-02-06T21:03:41	DanaHoule there's pretty good evidence that the overreport is strongest among southern black vtrs
Nate_Cohn	696076273756442625	2016-02-06T21:01:30	DanaHoule sure, it's not perfect. maybe it's off by a pt or two. maybe 3!
Nate_Cohn	696076210749616129	2016-02-06T21:01:15	DanaHoule 5) the CPS is a massive sample, 5x larger than exits, with standard weights, and without the challenge of cluster sampling
Nate_Cohn	696075749812363264	2016-02-06T20:59:25	DanaHoule 4) the CPS v exit difference is extraordinarily consistent. it's about an underlying bias, not noise. we know where the bias is
Nate_Cohn	696075322161131520	2016-02-06T20:57:43	DanaHoule 3) the preelection LV screens yield an electorate that's ~identical to the CPS. it's not perfect, obviously, but confirmatory
Nate_Cohn	696075061959131136	2016-02-06T20:56:41	DanaHoule 2) the exit poll figure is basically impossible. it shows 96% turnout. the cps shows a still high 82. halfway is a crazy 90
Nate_Cohn	696074945885962240	2016-02-06T20:56:14	DanaHoule 1) the exit polls aren't designed for it. they can't weight by educ, and we know there's huge educ response bias. the cps can.
Nate_Cohn	696074813123592192	2016-02-06T20:55:42	DanaHoule i've offered the list. i'll go through it again, last time.
Nate_Cohn	696074143817576448	2016-02-06T20:53:02	DanaHoule you're entitled to an opinion. but the balance of evidence is not balanced. it is overwhelmingly 1 sided
Nate_Cohn	696073747271274496	2016-02-06T20:51:28	DanaHoule it does have its own issues. but the exits are impossible, it's designed to measure the issue, and matches preelection polls.
Nate_Cohn	696073439640055808	2016-02-06T20:50:15	DanaHoule we have tremendous evidence that there's high response from high edu ppl. if you can't weight, you can dismiss it
Nate_Cohn	696073312581976064	2016-02-06T20:49:44	DanaHoule ultimately the exit polls are. not. designed. to measure education. they can't weight by it.
Nate_Cohn	696073240729354240	2016-02-06T20:49:27	DanaHoule no they didn't. those 10 polls were showing you RVs.
Nate_Cohn	696073137310412800	2016-02-06T20:49:03	DanaHoule ultimately, this is the reason why polls show what they do, whether you think the census is right or not
Nate_Cohn	696073077264748544	2016-02-06T20:48:48	DanaHoule look i can write 10k words on cps &gt; exits on this. to take a simple facts: the exit elect implies 96% turnout from BAs
Nate_Cohn	696056516437155840	2016-02-06T19:43:00	DanaHoule and the pew doc. Together it explains why the polls show what they do
Nate_Cohn	696056008934686720	2016-02-06T19:40:59	DanaHoule just look at the CPS
Nate_Cohn	696055606512209920	2016-02-06T19:39:23	DanaHoule no, not saying that
Nate_Cohn	696055333869846528	2016-02-06T19:38:18	DanaHoule  electorate is ~37 per census, LV Rdd
Nate_Cohn	696048473515253760	2016-02-06T19:11:02	DanaHoule you can't quite compare preelection polls to exits for the same reason that the elects are different, since exits = wtd to result
Nate_Cohn	696048344678830080	2016-02-06T19:10:31	DanaHoule well, not quite comparable. the preelection polling data shows O doing better among more edu whites than exits, bc less edu elect
Nate_Cohn	696047303769993216	2016-02-06T19:06:23	DanaHoule yes, could def. be bigger deal in states w few nonwhite voters, large edu gap. would tend to bias non-edu wtgs towards Ds
Nate_Cohn	696045592477171712	2016-02-06T18:59:35	SilentMars DanaHoule the_scrivener no. the pollsters look at the people who *don't* respond. they then weight respondents to all vtrs
Nate_Cohn	696045161701253120	2016-02-06T18:57:53	DanaHoule not irrelevant, but not massive. you can see why some pollsters choose not to care so much
Nate_Cohn	696044943958110208	2016-02-06T18:57:01	DanaHoule just for you, with admittedly slim hopes, i reweighted the 12 polls with and without edu. No edu wgt= helped Obama by net-1.5 pts
Nate_Cohn	696043275933712384	2016-02-06T18:50:23	SilentMars DanaHoule the_scrivener the exit polls know these issues. there's just nothing they can do about it
Nate_Cohn	696043064331149312	2016-02-06T18:49:33	DanaHoule it does matter. just not that much. your comparing somewhat extreme numbers: LV to RV, exits to polls.
Nate_Cohn	696042036340764673	2016-02-06T18:45:27	SilentMars DanaHoule the_scrivener they weight for things the interviewers can see: age, sex, black/not black. can't do hisp/edu, etc
Nate_Cohn	696041875921174528	2016-02-06T18:44:49	SilentMars DanaHoule the_scrivener because exit polls can't weight by education.they can only weight by visibly identifiable demogs.
Nate_Cohn	696041520047099904	2016-02-06T18:43:24	the_scrivener DanaHoule there is. this just isn't it.
Nate_Cohn	696041485658001408	2016-02-06T18:43:16	DanaHoule that's with an impossible electorate though :)
Nate_Cohn	696040974657531904	2016-02-06T18:41:14	DanaHoule the_scrivener it's enough of a deal for some pollsters to weight, but not enough for all
Nate_Cohn	696040730649702401	2016-02-06T18:40:16	DanaHoule the_scrivener do the math to see how much of a difference it would make, see for yourself. not irrelevant. not a huge deal
Nate_Cohn	696040490018349056	2016-02-06T18:39:19	DanaHoule the_scrivener edu gaps are pretty small 
Nate_Cohn	696038243251257345	2016-02-06T18:30:23	DanaHoule the_scrivener yes, a red herring. i'm going to go back to work. take care
Nate_Cohn	696037983460290560	2016-02-06T18:29:21	the_scrivener DanaHoule i have an interest in ensuring that people properly understand polls. it's my job. idk whether Q results are right
Nate_Cohn	696037672876265473	2016-02-06T18:28:07	DanaHoule the_scrivener the unweighted respondents = 46% col educ.
Nate_Cohn	696037244746887168	2016-02-06T18:26:25	DanaHoule the_scrivener no, sorry.
Nate_Cohn	696037070024757250	2016-02-06T18:25:43	DanaHoule the_scrivener and they're all in the same area.
Nate_Cohn	696037027217674240	2016-02-06T18:25:33	DanaHoule the_scrivener yes it does. the weight is the initial weight for each pollster. it's a weighted average of all of the weights.
Nate_Cohn	696033609933717504	2016-02-06T18:11:58	the_scrivener DanaHoule if seeing is believing, from 2012 polls w 17k interviews: 
Nate_Cohn	696032577556058112	2016-02-06T18:07:52	the_scrivener DanaHoule as you can infer it for anything else using Census data to weight by edu, which i cited as well
Nate_Cohn	696032499995021313	2016-02-06T18:07:34	the_scrivener DanaHoule i've cited pew, a compilation of a dozen preelection polls. i can't give cbs/nyt w/o perm., but you can infer it
Nate_Cohn	696031485548036096	2016-02-06T18:03:32	DanaHoule look, i am not going to look. i have work. but it is a fact that any poll that weights by edu will = low-mid 30s RVs, inc nyt/cbs
Nate_Cohn	696030979597578242	2016-02-06T18:01:31	DanaHoule not usually a bug deal, since there aren't usually huge edu splits, so it doesn't matter much
Nate_Cohn	696030872991088641	2016-02-06T18:01:06	DanaHoule i think pew is about right. i think polls that don't weight by edu = too high. i think q is slightly low, as i said since post 1
Nate_Cohn	696024633963847680	2016-02-06T17:36:18	DanaHoule i am fully confident that if you research this you will reach the right conclusion.
Nate_Cohn	696024588560441344	2016-02-06T17:36:08	DanaHoule i gave you data from  n=17,000 over &gt;10 polls. if you want more, look at every pew poll in their dataset. microdata online
Nate_Cohn	696024049743302656	2016-02-06T17:33:59	DanaHoule  no, RVs are less educated. The Q poll 31% is RVs. 
Nate_Cohn	696023155349987330	2016-02-06T17:30:26	DanaHoule if you're not persuaded at this point, there's nothing i can do. the facts are the facts and it answers your question
Nate_Cohn	696022883189936129	2016-02-06T17:29:21	DanaHoule polls that aren't weighted by edu significantly overstate education 
Nate_Cohn	696022728445263872	2016-02-06T17:28:44	DanaHoule no, that's 37% among LVs, not RVs. that's a big difference.
Nate_Cohn	696022626917961728	2016-02-06T17:28:20	DanaHoule yes, not every poll is weighted by education
Nate_Cohn	696021470078631936	2016-02-06T17:23:44	DanaHoule look, you asked whether it's an outlier. the answer is that it's not. and fwiw these polls have obama + 5.22 among RVs.
Nate_Cohn	696018637195358208	2016-02-06T17:12:29	DanaHoule here's a nice public one, last page: 
Nate_Cohn	696018305409163264	2016-02-06T17:11:10	DanaHoule in my compilation of ~10 polls from oct/nov 2012, BA+ = 33.4% of registered voters.
Nate_Cohn	696017825471664128	2016-02-06T17:09:15	DanaHoule this is testable, let me look
Nate_Cohn	696013698725388289	2016-02-06T16:52:51	DanaHoule ultimately, if you weight to the census tgt for the adult population you *will never* end with a poll that's as edu as the exits
Nate_Cohn	696013053360345089	2016-02-06T16:50:17	DanaHoule as i said, maybe by a little. not by much. the CPS had the 12 electorate at 36.6% BA+
Nate_Cohn	696012701185642497	2016-02-06T16:48:53	DanaHoule wgwinfrey you're looking at exit poll data. you can't respond to "exit polls too educated" with "exit polls say high edu"
Nate_Cohn	696012546860421120	2016-02-06T16:48:17	DanaHoule  compare to the census, which is what polls use for weighting. that's the explanation, whether you agree or not
Nate_Cohn	696012277367963648	2016-02-06T16:47:12	DanaHoule the exit polls are self-evidently biased towards higher education, by a lot. research it. 47% = a 96% turnout rate in '12
Nate_Cohn	696011690001838080	2016-02-06T16:44:52	31 is pbly too low, but the not-so-secret secret is that the exit polls appear to be far too educated

Nate_Cohn	693568306226319364	2016-01-30T22:55:44	MileHighStriker there's plenty of research on this. here's one from a few wks ago. see appendix c 
Nate_Cohn	693567134966910976	2016-01-30T22:51:05	MileHighStriker no, ppl who are more likely to vote are more likely to be interested in taking a political poll
Nate_Cohn	693554627086807040	2016-01-30T22:01:23	Probably more useful to look at the proportion who say they haven't caucused before
Nate_Cohn	693554579716317186	2016-01-30T22:01:12	It is not at all clear that this is the way to interpret turnout. Ppl who respond to polls = likelier to vote. 
Nate_Cohn	693524662400225280	2016-01-30T20:02:19	Nate_Cohn Confidence intervals are for Democrats

Nate_Cohn	693471862412697601	2016-01-30T16:32:30	akk5d the education gap isn't nearly as large as you'd guess. in fact, in our data he does better among non col whites than col whites
Nate_Cohn	693470367432757248	2016-01-30T16:26:34	kbaxterk but yes it's certainly possible
Nate_Cohn	693470327192600580	2016-01-30T16:26:24	kbaxterk no I didn't write that in the article--not enough evidence to be sure that's right
Nate_Cohn	693469703520526337	2016-01-30T16:23:56	kbaxterk  is she strong among women or weak among men?
Nate_Cohn	693464582279544833	2016-01-30T16:03:35	armandodkos i would say the evidence is inconclusive but consistent with a big sanders edge among less educated white men
Nate_Cohn	693460619727638529	2016-01-30T15:47:50	I don't have the evidence to prove it, but I would guess Clinton has fallen far behind Sanders among white men without college degrees.
Nate_Cohn	693460475632295937	2016-01-30T15:47:15	Sanders is making surprising gains among less affluent whites, but may be losing ground more affluent white voters 
Nate_Cohn	693457970865139714	2016-01-30T15:37:18	karpmj not among white people, at least in our data
Nate_Cohn	693455012064681985	2016-01-30T15:25:33	karpmj I don't see much of a gap, as that nyt cbs data I cited suggested
Nate_Cohn	693450694033018881	2016-01-30T15:08:23	karpmj Obama, for instance, didn't do all that much better among white liberals, but definitely did best among whites in liberal states
Nate_Cohn	693450561216188418	2016-01-30T15:07:52	karpmj fwiw I think there's a subtle difference between mainly doing well among liberals and mainly doing well in liberal areas
Nate_Cohn	693448287987191808	2016-01-30T14:58:50	karpmj Hm there was a line. Maybe copy desk took it out. I'll look when I get a shot

Nate_Cohn	693262080384716800	2016-01-30T02:38:54	I really do think you have to wait until things are done before you write the post-mortem on the 2016.

Nate_Cohn	691808128355168258	2016-01-26T02:21:25	JJacobs_RI yeah, but it's not definitive
Nate_Cohn	691799176091418626	2016-01-26T01:45:51	JohnCChatham his support is actually less committee
Nate_Cohn	691798615489155072	2016-01-26T01:43:37	jimcupples this issues in that piece remain his issues. Who knows whether he'll overcome them, but that's not a reason they don't exist
Nate_Cohn	691793881076273153	2016-01-26T01:24:48	jimcupples but I've never said anything other than he can compete in Iowa, even when he was down 20
Nate_Cohn	691793762998185984	2016-01-26T01:24:20	jimcupples if he wins outside of western caucuses and New England, I'll have been wrong
Nate_Cohn	691792808248766464	2016-01-26T01:20:33	jimcupples even that article says he'll compete in Iowa
Nate_Cohn	691792099033923584	2016-01-26T01:17:43	jimcupples I have said exactly nothing about who will win Iowa
Nate_Cohn	691790930031046656	2016-01-26T01:13:05	jimcupples what I said is factually accurate, regardless of what ultimately prevails
Nate_Cohn	691771320963612672	2016-01-25T23:55:10	EsotericCD ForecasterEnten this 4k number was 2012, btw. 14k in '08
Nate_Cohn	691766831988764672	2016-01-25T23:37:19	Trump appears to have retaken the poll lead in Iowa, and it's a huge gamble for the GOP 
Nate_Cohn	691766157687296000	2016-01-25T23:34:39	PatrickRuffini EsotericCD I didn't see that
Nate_Cohn	691763520535445505	2016-01-25T23:24:10	PatrickRuffini EsotericCD i agree. i also think sanders voters look like activist types.
Nate_Cohn	691763188988276738	2016-01-25T23:22:51	wccubbison ForecasterEnten EsotericCD yeah, that's shifts from no party--captured in RBS polls
Nate_Cohn	691762346524540930	2016-01-25T23:19:30	jstalnaker1 baseballcrank trump is leading everything
Nate_Cohn	691761907011866624	2016-01-25T23:17:45	EsotericCD ForecasterEnten the number of new registered voters in the iowa voter reg statistics looks real small. like maybe 4k iirc.
Nate_Cohn	691761224418267141	2016-01-25T23:15:02	EsotericCD ForecasterEnten not sure there's much evidence obama really had many unregistered voters. different than 1st time caucus goers

Nate_Cohn	691710217160114179	2016-01-25T19:52:21	jeremiahlyell yes, this has been studied extensively
Nate_Cohn	691710116362637313	2016-01-25T19:51:57	baseballcrank what reason do you have to think there has been such a shift, or that it would affect his standing within white vtrs
Nate_Cohn	691709781371961344	2016-01-25T19:50:37	Nate_Cohn It was 37 percent the week earlier, tied with 1 other week for best in 2.5 years
Nate_Cohn	691709654838202369	2016-01-25T19:50:07	Meanwhile, Obama's approval rating among white voters reached 38 percent in Gallup last week for the first time in 2.5 years

Nate_Cohn	691705470814388224	2016-01-25T19:33:30	kwcollins you think he has &lt;10% chance (which was defined by chait as "longshot")
Nate_Cohn	691704951614087173	2016-01-25T19:31:26	DouthatNYT jonathanchait MichaelRStrain i don't think it takes anything crazy for rubio to finish behind any of christie/kasich/bush
Nate_Cohn	691703549315645440	2016-01-25T19:25:52	DouthatNYT jonathanchait MichaelRStrain a trump win in IA would speed up the time table; log jam in NH persists
Nate_Cohn	691703364107771905	2016-01-25T19:25:07	DouthatNYT jonathanchait MichaelRStrain i think it's become likelier that the field doesn't narrow fast enough. you?
Nate_Cohn	691702581706506240	2016-01-25T19:22:01	chrislhayes i think that's pretty fair
Nate_Cohn	691702354333270017	2016-01-25T19:21:07	chrislhayes  oh i thought you meant for him to lose
Nate_Cohn	691702086732484608	2016-01-25T19:20:03	chrislhayes i don't think that's true. the main thing = field needs to narrow, quickly, after NH
Nate_Cohn	691701781940813824	2016-01-25T19:18:50	DouthatNYT jonathanchait MichaelRStrain under 10? wow. idk about that.

Nate_Cohn	691700160406110208	2016-01-25T19:12:24	The risk for the establishment in IA: Trump momentum. The upside? Conservative vtrs could be key to beating him. 
Nate_Cohn	691697924422668288	2016-01-25T19:03:30	A Trump win in Iowa would bring both a huge danger and a big opportunity for the mainstream candidates 
Nate_Cohn	691697581815128064	2016-01-25T19:02:09	Trump has led in 10 of the last 12 polls in Iowa.

Nate_Cohn	691657929716568065	2016-01-25T16:24:35	Bernie Sanders has a huge turnout challenge--and it's also a challenge for the polls
