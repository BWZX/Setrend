JMurray804	667036624098848768	2015-11-18T17:48:18	BenChu_ Agree that government should decide if worth the gamble, not LPC. LPC should monitor results/hold gov to account if policy failing.
JMurray804	667029877556707328	2015-11-18T17:21:30	BenChu_ seems a rather tenuous assumption to explain the findings to me.
JMurray804	667029551583752194	2015-11-18T17:20:12	BenChu_ so you could theoretically achieve a gain in productivity so long as you're willing to accept higher structural unemployment.
JMurray804	667023760919289856	2015-11-18T16:57:11	BenChu_ not saying you shouldn't do it, just that the efficiency wage argument doesn't survive aggregation.
JMurray804	667023362170966016	2015-11-18T16:55:36	BenChu_ True , but doesn't widen the gap between earners. So no increase in incentive. If anything makes it weaker as pay scale compresses.
JMurray804	667019561145909248	2015-11-18T16:40:30	StrongerInNos BenChu_ resfoundation Indeed, productivity gains mean a higher minimum wage can be set without prompting job losses.
