Wealthfront	717023234336690176	2016-04-04T16:17:15	Introducing Wealthfront 3.0. The next wave in financial advice.    
Wealthfront	716871602332418048	2016-04-04T06:14:43	llang629 Check out how-to:  There's a way to transcribe just a few numbers from your Form 1099B instead of importing
Wealthfront	716869973801570304	2016-04-04T06:08:15	AaronCohen Wealthfront has much lower fees below $100k and is far more tax optimized above $100k.
Wealthfront	716762412414668800	2016-04-03T23:00:50	Finally filed my taxes. Thanks Wealthfront for making all of those TLH entires automatic via TurboTax!! dontfearTLH
Wealthfront	716761197270405120	2016-04-03T22:56:00	jlax Great, glad to have you both!
Wealthfront	716760804163522560	2016-04-03T22:54:27	edog1203 My mistake, meant to mention jlax
Wealthfront	716760020701024256	2016-04-03T22:51:20	edog1203 Tax Loss Harvesting is lots of value for 0.25% advisory fee. Get started with first $15k managed for free: 
Wealthfront	716759266837807105	2016-04-03T22:48:20	edog1203 Vanguard target date is good but our tax loss harvesting can add up to +1.5% return from tax savings: 
Wealthfront	716756569317384192	2016-04-03T22:37:37	llang629 Yes, lots of tax loss harvesting last year. Should give you a solid deduction against other invest income or $3k of regular income
Wealthfront	716755890276319232	2016-04-03T22:34:55	llang629 Just emailed our contact over there to investigate direct import. The XLS import is an option though. I'll keep you posted.
Wealthfront	716746609279770626	2016-04-03T21:58:02	llang629 We've heard of stability issues on TT Mac w/ pretty low txn volumes. We rec TT online, but sounds like you're past that point.
Wealthfront	716746127438188545	2016-04-03T21:56:07	llang629 Yes, it's a solid tool. We've worked with them directly in the past when clients had this issue.
Wealthfront	716745025812566020	2016-04-03T21:51:45	llang629 Which version of TurboTax are you using? You may be able to directly enter Form 1099-B subtotals if it's really bogging down.
Wealthfront	716449120261636096	2016-04-03T02:15:55	KentuckyNomad Passive investing is all about finding right asset allocation, keeping fees low, optimizing for taxes &amp; focusing on long-term
