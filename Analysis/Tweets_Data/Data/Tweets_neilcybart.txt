neilcybart	725399680142721025	2016-04-27T19:02:15	Pretty much no mention of this in my Twitter feed today (Twitter earnings reaction). Do people still care? 
neilcybart	725395134859350022	2016-04-27T18:44:11	Not sure which is scarier: These MacRumor comments are the number of up votes. 
neilcybart	725393868368257025	2016-04-27T18:39:10	Now take this "room" and attach four wheels. Notice how that becomes much more than just about personal transport.
neilcybart	725393381359276033	2016-04-27T18:37:13	inglorious_b so let's start with the room on wheels... ;)
neilcybart	725392718558560256	2016-04-27T18:34:35	A room in our home becomes "smart" when we have an iPhone in our hand. Unclear how much more can happen w/o big change to the house itself.
neilcybart	725392146036039680	2016-04-27T18:32:19	Can a home truly become "smart" without changing the way we build/manufacture that home?
neilcybart	725391510959697920	2016-04-27T18:29:47	Lots to digest in this chart.   1) Notice 0.2% overall growth 2) "Others" down 11% 3) OPPO &amp; vivo 4) Lots of changes

neilcybart	725208223775657984	2016-04-27T06:21:28	alex cullend adamnash for sure. No question about it and I think it will only get more interesting as sales growth remains blah.
neilcybart	725207951527546881	2016-04-27T06:20:24	cullend alex adamnash you need a lot more bashing. Would be tough raising more than $50-$75B (can’t use AAPL shareholder cash obviously).
neilcybart	725207188449325056	2016-04-27T06:17:22	cullend alex adamnash this is not Dell 2.0 where Cook owns large portion of AAPL. Therefore that leaves PE firms.
neilcybart	725207002255863808	2016-04-27T06:16:37	cullend alex adamnash problem with going private is…who will actually take them private? Certainly not Tim Cook or management.
neilcybart	725206642632085504	2016-04-27T06:15:11	cullend alex adamnash I’m up. Rise debt in U.S. and elsewhere to buy back shares (all U.S.). No tax consequences.

neilcybart	725162332175908864	2016-04-27T03:19:07	mobile_reach 1) R&amp;D, 2) dividends, 3) buyback
neilcybart	725160908260020225	2016-04-27T03:13:28	mobile_reach they don't break out where R&amp;D dollars are being spent and from what subsidiaries. Would need to back into that (no time now).
neilcybart	725160393665052672	2016-04-27T03:11:25	mobile_reach don't know that percentage but judging from U.S. cash trends, there is room for all 3 (organic growth, M&amp;A, capital return).
neilcybart	725159976893861888	2016-04-27T03:09:45	chrisdomico last I checked it was on par with its predecessor.

neilcybart	725158114983600128	2016-04-27T03:02:22	blakehill he's probably referring to Hong Kong, but yes... a bit odd.
neilcybart	725157960926765056	2016-04-27T03:01:45	mobile_reach $2.5B on R&amp;D last quarter.
neilcybart	725157767653265408	2016-04-27T03:00:59	kris_hat a few reasons - I actually just recently discussed the Apple dividend here: 
neilcybart	725157411326152704	2016-04-27T02:59:34	three28capital I didn't get that impression.
neilcybart	725157337602904064	2016-04-27T02:59:16	smenor there are many other (scarier) ways to spend it.
neilcybart	725156725565837313	2016-04-27T02:56:50	ApplWatcher pretty much
neilcybart	725156605415817216	2016-04-27T02:56:22	bdesarnauts I know
neilcybart	725156546603261954	2016-04-27T02:56:08	cullend Yes (that was my thesis a few months ago - wrote it up for AboveAvalonPlus)
neilcybart	725156211709087744	2016-04-27T02:54:48	mhafez is this referring to consumers or Apple?
neilcybart	725156007811420162	2016-04-27T02:53:59	nealmcquaid my Mac is from 2009..I think.
neilcybart	725155718509264899	2016-04-27T02:52:50	ryanluikens there's more than just longer replacement cycles at play here.
neilcybart	725155171119075328	2016-04-27T02:50:40	JohnWilson tough to do though. Leasing programs end up costing more for that ability to upgrade.
neilcybart	725154986066325504	2016-04-27T02:49:56	mhafez You are right - the "S" naming scheme is part of a broader marketing strategy that needs a refresh to reflect a more mature product.
neilcybart	725153333372133376	2016-04-27T02:43:22	jacexs Yes. Large smartphones took most of the oxygen out of the tablet market.
neilcybart	725153026403651585	2016-04-27T02:42:08	Brian_Fey been a flood of low-end tablets. Strictly speaking, iPad share has declined...but that's not too important.
neilcybart	725152577357250565	2016-04-27T02:40:21	iPhonist11 I agree (although I am on the Upgrade Program now).
neilcybart	725152515856195585	2016-04-27T02:40:07	eli_slade at a certain point (usually life cycle length), numbers don't make much sense.
neilcybart	725152202139000832	2016-04-27T02:38:52	chrisdomico the 12.9-inch Pro is doing decent. Primary problem is 7.9-inch.
neilcybart	725108051448045571	2016-04-26T23:43:25	About those silly BuzzFeed live videos on Facebook…. 
neilcybart	725101094406348800	2016-04-26T23:15:47	chrisdomico that just means that iPad results have gotten so bad it should be easier to report growth...in theory.
neilcybart	725084271053033474	2016-04-26T22:08:56	TheNewLou "iPad needs pro software" stuff.
neilcybart	725083692943724544	2016-04-26T22:06:38	adamstein therefore they are funny.
neilcybart	725083331625406465	2016-04-26T22:05:12	Earnings calls are funny. Analysts trying to determine future cash flows. Yet no questions on new wearable products or Project Titan.
neilcybart	725082837834190848	2016-04-26T22:03:14	CALL OVER.   A transcript of these tweets will be made available as long as Twitter remains in business.
neilcybart	725082619067666432	2016-04-26T22:02:22	Fun analyst questions to Cook not asked:  "What do you think of the Model 3?"  "I plan on buying a car in 2 years. What are your thoughts?"
neilcybart	725082063813115906	2016-04-26T22:00:10	Anyone saying these Apple results are due to Apple software problems is barking up the wrong tree.
neilcybart	725081606151626753	2016-04-26T21:58:20	Apple clearly walking back its Services narrative from last quarter.
neilcybart	725080980067913731	2016-04-26T21:55:51	Cook carefully answering this Services question regarding how Apple views Services.
neilcybart	725079752017596416	2016-04-26T21:50:58	Cook: We no longer have the wind at our back with China.   Yep.
neilcybart	725079640985858048	2016-04-26T21:50:32	Cook: Hong Kong is a big problem. Mainland China doing better - but still down a little bit.
neilcybart	725079224537763840	2016-04-26T21:48:53	Analyst to Cook: What is going on in China?  OK.
neilcybart	725079107898322945	2016-04-26T21:48:25	Tim Cook: If people upgraded to the 6s like they did with the 6, we would be having a huge party right now.
neilcybart	725078758949052417	2016-04-26T21:47:02	Tim Cook to Toni: I didn't say the things you said I said.
neilcybart	725078227157438467	2016-04-26T21:44:55	Tim Cook: I don't think the iPhone SE is going to be like the iPad mini (with a laugh at the end).
neilcybart	725078016871796737	2016-04-26T21:44:05	Tim always seems so frustrated by Toni's questions.
neilcybart	725077737912848384	2016-04-26T21:42:58	Toni Sac: Ok, let me tell you what I think is going on here.
neilcybart	725077524250804225	2016-04-26T21:42:07	Cook: India is where China was in 2006.  (iPhone came out in 2007).
neilcybart	725077364879794176	2016-04-26T21:41:29	Cook on iPhone sales in India: LTE rollout is just beginning. We need to build distribution.   Code: Don't expect much anytime soon.
neilcybart	725076715945480192	2016-04-26T21:38:55	Morgan Stanley to Cook: "appreciate the optimism" on iPhone.   Code: Ok, let's get real now.
neilcybart	725074924071739392	2016-04-26T21:31:47	Tim Cook: We would buy large companies. We want great technology and people though. (And not just revenue and sales).
neilcybart	725074295299444737	2016-04-26T21:29:17	Tim Cook: Smartphone market is not growing due to economy. We are optimistic that this will pass and we will grow again.
neilcybart	725074061366288384	2016-04-26T21:28:22	Analyst: Tim, is Apple a growth company or a mature tech company?
neilcybart	725073581592436736	2016-04-26T21:26:27	Apple: We are lowering our channel inventory by $2 billion (another way of saying sales are slowing across the board).
neilcybart	725072980448038914	2016-04-26T21:24:04	Luca: We are going to keep increasing the quarterly cash dividend every year.
neilcybart	725072336421052416	2016-04-26T21:21:30	I know why Apple talks about customer satisfaction numbers but these numbers always feel so...blah.
neilcybart	725072130271010820	2016-04-26T21:20:41	Apple: Apple Watch available in 60 countries.
neilcybart	725071549179531264	2016-04-26T21:18:23	Yeah, Luca definitely breezed over that Services piece.
neilcybart	725071067291766789	2016-04-26T21:16:28	Still early in the call but Apple management not pushing the Services narrative too much.
neilcybart	725070545717440512	2016-04-26T21:14:23	Cook: We are kicking off so much cash flow we are going to increase our capital return program.
neilcybart	725070377555210240	2016-04-26T21:13:43	Cook: We made 15 acquisitions in the past four quarters. Always looking for more companies to help us grow.
neilcybart	725070214631673856	2016-04-26T21:13:04	Cook: "Future of Apple is very bright."
neilcybart	725070063766765568	2016-04-26T21:12:29	Tim Cook: iPad is the best tablet ever.   Yep. People love their iPads. That isn't the debate surrounding iPad though.
neilcybart	725069528821030912	2016-04-26T21:10:21	Tim Cook: We learned a lot about Apple Watch in its first year.    Tough to disagree with that statement.
neilcybart	725069281113825281	2016-04-26T21:09:22	Tim Cook: Apple Watch unit sales met expectations. Seasonality will resemble iPod. Sales will be focused around holidays.
neilcybart	725068789092651009	2016-04-26T21:07:25	Tim Cook referred to Apple Music as Apple's "first" subscription business. Yes, I'm going to read into that line.
neilcybart	725068174090227714	2016-04-26T21:04:58	Tim Cook: iPhone business is "healthy and strong."
neilcybart	725067963360022529	2016-04-26T21:04:08	Tim Cook: Revenue was down 9% in constant currency.
neilcybart	725066740112216066	2016-04-26T20:59:16	The one Apple number that is up (excluding capital management): "Installed Base Related Purchases" 
neilcybart	725065235065913344	2016-04-26T20:53:17	The iPad is just awful (from a sales perspective). Sales now down 40% in two years. That's not a software problem. That's a tablet problem.
neilcybart	725064508696367107	2016-04-26T20:50:24	Apple needs to move far away from any resemblance to the iPhone S-cycle. Development-wise they already have. Marketing...not yet.
neilcybart	725064321949138944	2016-04-26T20:49:40	The iPhone 6s is probably going to be the last iPhone with an "S" in the name.

neilcybart	725063112685137920	2016-04-26T20:44:51	chrisdomico a little bit better.
neilcybart	725062929729634305	2016-04-26T20:44:08	Tim Cook to WSJ: 2Q was "a challenging quarter." Consumers just aren't as interested in the iPhone 6s/6s Plus compared to the 6/6 Plus.
neilcybart	725062014075342854	2016-04-26T20:40:29	AAPL currently down 6% to $98. Basically same level it was at before reporting 1Q16 results in January.
neilcybart	725061581147652100	2016-04-26T20:38:46	Dividend increased 10% to $0.57.  Buyback authorization increased by $35 billion.
neilcybart	725060773341450241	2016-04-26T20:35:33	That "Other Products" revenue line item looks pretty weak = Apple Watch sales.

neilcybart	718474776600252420	2016-04-08T16:25:10	ubeenfranked Apple is using 4-inch screen form factor to sell a lower-priced iPhone.
neilcybart	718474462874726400	2016-04-08T16:23:55	ubeenfranked difference is I think SE is much more like 5c than many assume - they are both bets with targeted missions.
neilcybart	718471694604771332	2016-04-08T16:12:55	ubeenfranked the SE is a revamped iPhone 5s targeting 5s users. Doubt Apple could have priced it for more than $450.
neilcybart	718470985402474496	2016-04-08T16:10:06	ubeenfranked the price says the iPhone SE doesn't cost too much to build.

neilcybart	718469409040412672	2016-04-08T16:03:50	ubeenfranked "erosion in price" brings up a different kind of connotation that I'm comfortable with.
neilcybart	718468787792646148	2016-04-08T16:01:22	ubeenfranked it's a continuation of their screen size differentiation strategy mixed with slowly but surely moving down market with price.
neilcybart	718468573027508225	2016-04-08T16:00:30	ubeenfranked I wax expecting $450. The additional $50 was result of Apple being able to make the thing for a decent margin.
neilcybart	718468420115828737	2016-04-08T15:59:54	ubeenfranked we never saw a "new" 4-inch iPhone though. Can't just assume it should have been $549 or even $499.
neilcybart	718468055249129473	2016-04-08T15:58:27	ubeenfranked pretty much, which is a continuation of what we saw beginning in 2014.
neilcybart	718467964895371264	2016-04-08T15:58:05	ubeenfranked I look at it differently. I don't think Apple had any other option. They couldn't put old tech at higher price.
neilcybart	718467529602162690	2016-04-08T15:56:22	ubeenfranked as for price...it's as if the iPhone 5s continued to be sold for another year.
neilcybart	718467339163996160	2016-04-08T15:55:36	ubeenfranked It's a phone meant to succeed the iPhone 5s and represent the 4-inch form factor for at least the next year.
neilcybart	718467193353211906	2016-04-08T15:55:02	ubeenfranked it's an iPhone 5s meant to live a bit longer in the line up.

neilcybart	718131645904236544	2016-04-07T17:41:41	benthompson it seems like Apple's strategy related to that subject is to purposely not run too fast (because they can't).
neilcybart	718130599836442624	2016-04-07T17:37:31	benthompson my primary concern (doubt?) relates to hardware. Having Amazon's attitude about risk and doing hardware is...interesting.

neilcybart	716671651027488768	2016-04-03T17:00:11	JimmyMcGiggin  Here's a look at some of the top retailers with Fitbit. AW isn't found at all of these locations. 
neilcybart	716662583063941120	2016-04-03T16:24:09	lsukernik why were you surprised? We are in a fitness/health craze right now. My question was where would Fitbit be in a few years.
neilcybart	716662323151314945	2016-04-03T16:23:07	glen_george what's the issue?
neilcybart	716661575873085440	2016-04-03T16:20:09	But it says a lot that the company saw the need to issue a press release. The Blaze appeared to have damaged Fitbit's reputation a bit.
neilcybart	716661023164534787	2016-04-03T16:17:57	Unlike Apple Watch, Fitbits are sold everywhere. More skepticism is needed when dealing with "shipped" numbers for the company.
neilcybart	716660722705559553	2016-04-03T16:16:45	Fitbit said it shipped 1M Fitbit Blaze in a month.   Of course....shipped is not the same as sold to consumers.   
neilcybart	716659704294936577	2016-04-03T16:12:43	Facebook said no to streaming NFL games (for now). Disagreement was over advertising (&amp; early morning London games). 
neilcybart	716439461421256704	2016-04-03T01:37:33	Most people buy things according to price. I don't think people complaining about iPad line complexity are taking that into consideration.

neilcybart	712204223543377920	2016-03-22T09:08:13	Looks like a series of terrorist attacks in Belgium. I know some of you are from there (or have relatives there). Stay safe.
neilcybart	712186800031309824	2016-03-22T07:58:59	One good thing about Wall Street sell-side: You had strict deadlines for notes (1 AM) if you wanted your note to appear in morning packet.
neilcybart	712186540940779520	2016-03-22T07:57:57	jacexs thanks
neilcybart	712088888920186881	2016-03-22T01:29:55	Consensus reaction:  Twitter's 10th birthday: "Wow. Lots of good memories" Facebook's 10th birthday: "Ugh. I been on here that long?"
neilcybart	712060084000595969	2016-03-21T23:35:28	WinObs cullend they all then clap literally two seconds after that screenshot.
neilcybart	712051433638662145	2016-03-21T23:01:05	Apple: 0.1 U.S. Government: 0  This will be a long road.
neilcybart	712035897378738176	2016-03-21T21:59:21	ShawnKing is this from seeing him in the room or from the live video? Others are saying he wasn't there.
neilcybart	712030393227018240	2016-03-21T21:37:29	Did anyone see Jony at all?
neilcybart	712015830184124416	2016-03-21T20:39:37	Apple (2007): PC users are living in hell. Apple (2016): It's sad that 600M users are still on old PCs.  Phil Schiller is old school Apple.
neilcybart	712011867313414144	2016-03-21T20:23:52	Walt Mossberg calls it the iPhone 5se.
neilcybart	712011135680024576	2016-03-21T20:20:57	Phil Schiller talked with the Verge on Facebook...live.   
neilcybart	711984749930160128	2016-03-21T18:36:07	Dieulot Yes. I think I thought the same thing.
neilcybart	711984477891731457	2016-03-21T18:35:02	rickblauraya good point
neilcybart	711984381963833344	2016-03-21T18:34:39	Notice that small bump up for Liam? 
neilcybart	711984075980967940	2016-03-21T18:33:26	Now I have to go back and actually watch the Apple keynote.
neilcybart	711983409329930240	2016-03-21T18:30:47	Tesla just announced they will begin selling the Model 3 on the West Coast only. Will eventually bring the car to other states over time.
neilcybart	711982341221122048	2016-03-21T18:26:32	neilcybart Antennagate event was less than 34 mins
neilcybart	711982772223541249	2016-03-21T18:28:15	jacexs Yes, that is the one that crossed my mind.
neilcybart	711982466613923840	2016-03-21T18:27:02	Technically, the iPad line did not expand (only in name). This lineup is going to change though...give it time. 
neilcybart	711981829742432256	2016-03-21T18:24:30	Anyone happen to know what was the shortest Apple keynote/event over the past 10 years?
neilcybart	711981177926594560	2016-03-21T18:21:55	All of you iPhone 5s users (last time I asked there were quite a few of you out there), are you going to buy the iPhone SE?
neilcybart	711980919293227008	2016-03-21T18:20:53	DanGraziano I count a band + case combo as a model since you need to choose one at purchase.
neilcybart	711980468007088128	2016-03-21T18:19:06	There are now 22 Apple Watch Sport models.
neilcybart	711980202012704768	2016-03-21T18:18:02	Looks like a LIVESTRONG Apple Watch. 
neilcybart	711979504390934528	2016-03-21T18:15:16	Doesn't look like Apple Watch collection got a price drop.
neilcybart	711978534172950528	2016-03-21T18:11:25	Being told the iPad line was not actually simplified. OK then.
neilcybart	711978331671896065	2016-03-21T18:10:36	The WWDC keynote will be at least 30 minutes longer than this keynote when including Drake's Apple Music monologue.
neilcybart	711978080940609540	2016-03-21T18:09:37	arainert I think Apple would want to put together a meaty presentation so if there is something ready (which is likely) then yes.

neilcybart	711977628345831428	2016-03-21T18:07:49	arainert new flagship iPhones was the primary thing.
neilcybart	711977518379638784	2016-03-21T18:07:22	cullend I'm just referring to fact that it will literally be larger than this keynote. Flagship iPhones, probably Apple Watch updates etc.
neilcybart	711976896687263745	2016-03-21T18:04:54	The Apple event this coming September is going to be big.
neilcybart	711976702126108672	2016-03-21T18:04:08	64 minutes. A very, very short Apple keynote.
neilcybart	711976257089482752	2016-03-21T18:02:22	Anyone else hear Luca clap really hard when Apple announced they are selling an extra 224GB of storage for $300?
neilcybart	711976101157842944	2016-03-21T18:01:45	IPAD LINE GOT SIMPLIFIED.
neilcybart	711975321126309888	2016-03-21T17:58:39	d_leecarter I heard Luca clapping extra hard.
neilcybart	711975067790348288	2016-03-21T17:57:38	iPad Pro 9.7-inch has a 256GB storage option. Only time before that option comes to iPhone. Maybe a few months?
neilcybart	711974887154266112	2016-03-21T17:56:55	iPad Pro 9.7-inch for $599 (32GB)
neilcybart	711974704710418432	2016-03-21T17:56:12	Already looking forward to the "Apple Watch is a flop because now you can get one for $299" headlines.
neilcybart	711974345543790593	2016-03-21T17:54:46	The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is a really great device..like great.   Hard to pitch a smaller version of it besides "its smaller" and "cheaper."
neilcybart	711973710572326912	2016-03-21T17:52:15	Schiller: The new iPad Pro has grunt.   ?
neilcybart	711973122287636480	2016-03-21T17:49:54	Schiller saying some things that 98% of consumers will never know or care about.
neilcybart	711972619482869760	2016-03-21T17:47:54	Schiller: It's really sad that there are 600M people using Windows PCs over 5 years old.
neilcybart	711972448808271872	2016-03-21T17:47:14	200M iPads with 9.7-inch display. 197M of them were iPad 2.   *joke*
neilcybart	711972271007485952	2016-03-21T17:46:31	"Second member of iPad Pro family."  Families coming to iPad.
neilcybart	711972104476893184	2016-03-21T17:45:52	They went through the iPhone SE so quickly I began thinking they would have Schiller introduce the new iPad Pro.
neilcybart	711971838419558400	2016-03-21T17:44:48	They kept Schiller for the really new stuff...
neilcybart	711971796573036545	2016-03-21T17:44:38	Yah Schiller.
neilcybart	711971357626490880	2016-03-21T17:42:54	Yes, it helps having Apple News just a swipe away from the home screen...hey that counts...
neilcybart	711971132425920512	2016-03-21T17:42:00	Apple News has 50M users. Woah.
neilcybart	711970178905452544	2016-03-21T17:38:13	$399 iPhone SE.
neilcybart	711970131132350464	2016-03-21T17:38:01	That's not a knock on Joz. He's doing fine.
neilcybart	711969738222469120	2016-03-21T17:36:28	FYI: Phil Schiller is Apple's best presenter.
neilcybart	711969469409529856	2016-03-21T17:35:23	tim newer than some, but he's been on stage before.
neilcybart	711968880160145409	2016-03-21T17:33:03	Apple: Customers have been pleading to us to keep a 4-inch iPhone.
neilcybart	711968681798934528	2016-03-21T17:32:16	13% of iPhones sold in 2015 were 4-inch iPhones.
neilcybart	711968518367916033	2016-03-21T17:31:37	Not Phil?   Hmm.
neilcybart	711968248363757573	2016-03-21T17:30:32	Curious if Apple Watch collection sees $100 price drop.
neilcybart	711967769659486212	2016-03-21T17:28:38	$50 Apple Watch early adopter tax.
neilcybart	711967661232525314	2016-03-21T17:28:12	Apple dropping Apple Watch's price. Will start at $299.
neilcybart	711967268847026176	2016-03-21T17:26:39	1/3 of Apple Watch owners change bands.
neilcybart	711966833855696897	2016-03-21T17:24:55	Liam's offspring will know how to build a car.
neilcybart	711966173479317504	2016-03-21T17:22:18	CareKit?   Doubling down...
neilcybart	711965603070746624	2016-03-21T17:20:02	20 minutes in.
neilcybart	711964708744499200	2016-03-21T17:16:28	Donald Trump: Liam will live in the U.S. when I'm president.

neilcybart	711964116135452672	2016-03-21T17:14:07	Currently not occurring at the Apple keynote. 
neilcybart	711963787272716288	2016-03-21T17:12:49	Did any rumors of Liam leak? Nope.   Doubling down on secrecy....
neilcybart	711962595306016768	2016-03-21T17:08:05	These environmental slides will have a whole new meaning when Apple starts selling an electric car.
neilcybart	711961239195287552	2016-03-21T17:02:41	Apple. Creating new words for 40 years.
neilcybart	711939194189275137	2016-03-21T15:35:05	gamblebigman it probably could go either way. Even then I wouldn't expect the change to be too significant.
neilcybart	711933369769046016	2016-03-21T15:11:57	arainert I'll have to try it again, but the 12.9-inch just doesn't come off as large to me.
neilcybart	711931438266908672	2016-03-21T15:04:16	arainert This is all subjective of course. I came from a 9.7-inch and found the screen size to just not be worth my time.
neilcybart	711929198915428352	2016-03-21T14:55:22	arainert similar to how many said the 7.9-inch was the right/best iPad?
neilcybart	711924829138460674	2016-03-21T14:38:00	lsukernik assuming the FBI one progresses to point where Congress enacts new law sand Apple appeals, I would expect the court to take it.
neilcybart	711924465190379520	2016-03-21T14:36:34	abdophoto could change but for now iPhone makes a better capture device while Mac makes a better editing device.
neilcybart	711923848694738944	2016-03-21T14:34:07	markgurman forgot the 12.9-inch iPad Pro even has cameras.
neilcybart	711922679884845057	2016-03-21T14:29:28	This is a major blow to Apple. They didn't want the case going to the U.S. Supreme Court. Samsung, along with Google &amp; Facebook wanted it.
neilcybart	711922197858680832	2016-03-21T14:27:33	The U.S. Supreme Court just agreed to hear Apple vs Samsung. Outcome will have major impact on how to value design. 
neilcybart	711916037566894081	2016-03-21T14:03:04	Curious where young people are getting tech news/rumors? YouTube.  TechSmartt = 823K subs The Verge = 990K subs

neilcybart	711592219409518592	2016-03-20T16:36:20	I can see why Apple is partnering with DJI for the Phantom 4 in Apple Retail. The thing is a beast.   (6:41 to 7:39)

neilcybart	711244668697186304	2016-03-19T17:35:17	cullend $450 would be least surprising. Not much need to go lower and a bit brave to go higher.

neilcybart	682625088601108482	2015-12-31T18:11:18	rjonesy for towns like mine, car sharing won't be too bad. Take grand list (fewer cars) and just adjust the mill rate higher. Pretty easy.

neilcybart	682622997501468672	2015-12-31T18:02:59	Similar thing will occur with gas tax and electric cars. States will just make up revenue somewhere else. Higher sales tax/fees/etc.
