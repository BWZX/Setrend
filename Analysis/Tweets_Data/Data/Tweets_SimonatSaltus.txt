SimonatSaltus	680869410366746625	2015-12-26T21:54:52	SimonatSaltus Exactly. UK is a large net importer from EU, so overall free trade benefits EU more than UK.

SimonatSaltus	680861669032095745	2015-12-26T21:24:06	SimonatSaltus Pardon, proof? if UK outside EU its exports would be hit by tariffs just like any country's.

SimonatSaltus	680853219644444672	2015-12-26T20:50:31	RobinWigg why do you think we should stay in Eu? Do you have an article I can read? Thanks.
