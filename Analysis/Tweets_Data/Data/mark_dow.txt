mark_dow	684924645275926528	2016-01-07T02:28:55	groditi I knew you would. Also, your bps are spread out over time, so impact of rate of inflation (as opp to lvl) very very small
mark_dow	684924302332805120	2016-01-07T02:27:33	DavidSchawel got to think thru magnitude of move, elasticities and degree of openness to get a sense for impact. Way smaller than ppl think
mark_dow	684922946406584320	2016-01-07T02:22:10	The US has net imports from China at &lt;2% GDP. So how much would USDCNY need to move to see meaningful deflationary pressure? dothemath
mark_dow	684922296721526784	2016-01-07T02:19:35	freshwatermacro DavidSchawel Not so. It is not very deflationary, given China's net exports as a share of GDP. Again, run the numbers
mark_dow	684921160337772544	2016-01-07T02:15:04	DavidSchawel This still works wrt where Chinese policymakers are comign from 
mark_dow	684920690680565760	2016-01-07T02:13:12	DavidSchawel If you do the math, it's not that powerful. Imports large share of exports. Won't help growth much &amp; won't help type they want
mark_dow	684918956264534016	2016-01-07T02:06:19	DavidSchawel Also, ppl still are focusing out of habit on USDCNY rrather than on basket, which has moved less (look at EUR)
mark_dow	684918622452465664	2016-01-07T02:04:59	DavidSchawel Reaction. It's now a 'live' variable and ppl have to figure out how to deal with it, against already fragile backdrop.
