HowardKurtz	725426901964054528	2016-04-27T20:50:25	Carly is singing a made-up song. Guess she read all those media critiques that she came off as too stern
HowardKurtz	725426737937567745	2016-04-27T20:49:46	I don't know if there's much traction in Cruz &amp; Carly saying Trump is just a liberal like Hillary. Feels like it overshoots the mark
HowardKurtz	725426414921506817	2016-04-27T20:48:29	Carly: Everyone in media saying it's over, Trump won. But, she insists, it's not over.
HowardKurtz	725423823751782400	2016-04-27T20:38:11	Given this lengthy Cruz buildup, sounds like Carly should be at the top of the ticket

HowardKurtz	725133691169738752	2016-04-27T01:25:18	New Hillary slogan? She says she wants a world where love trumps hate
HowardKurtz	725131632894709760	2016-04-27T01:17:08	Trump's sweep gives him momentum, media but not necessarily math. That now matters less than psychological impact 
HowardKurtz	725121700782870529	2016-04-27T00:37:40	Stepped away for a second and now Trump has won Delaware. His sweep is priced into the stock, but still a very big night
