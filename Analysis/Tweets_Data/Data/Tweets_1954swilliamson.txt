1954swilliamson	721381436255670276	2016-04-16T16:55:11	kocherlakota009 question for you: finite horizon, active policy. why don't you consider ZLB and close to it at time T?
1954swilliamson	721380216220725248	2016-04-16T16:50:20	kocherlakota009 you'll never see pi_t+1&lt;-2r

1954swilliamson	721378562633170944	2016-04-16T16:43:46	kocherlakota009 Well, we needed that to get the asset pricing equation (1). So, now we have (1), and your equation (2). 1/2

1954swilliamson	720994409328680965	2016-04-15T15:17:17	kocherlakota009 Noahpinion quick fix: subsistence cons.put it in the tech. Can't get enough to eat, can't work at all, so lwr bound on y

1954swilliamson	720977144420040705	2016-04-15T14:08:40	kocherlakota009 Noahpinion so what I see are: (i) I think you could have P-curves that would permit m policy to nail down Fisherian eqm.

1954swilliamson	720716401695023104	2016-04-14T20:52:35	kocherlakota009 Noahpinion yes, looks like it can't kill equilibria going to ZLB. of course, ngv nominal rate could fix it.

1954swilliamson	720702871612751873	2016-04-14T19:58:49	kocherlakota009 Noahpinion Though note that (10) kills all those weird equilibria in NK's finite horizon setup.

1954swilliamson	719710791490936836	2016-04-12T02:16:38	Claudia_Sahm I'll say. I'm tired of hearing about this "new" revolution in empirical work.

1954swilliamson	719344066136150017	2016-04-11T01:59:24	Noahpinion humanzane But some people might argue that, in a crisis, you should use open market operations rather than directed lending.
1954swilliamson	719343914851762176	2016-04-11T01:58:48	Noahpinion humanzane that argument is rare. Friedman would even have supported lending by the central bank in a crisis.

1954swilliamson	717349860492455938	2016-04-05T13:55:09	PIrelandatBC In the US, the interest rate margin is typically attributed to regulatory costs.
1954swilliamson	717349635501625344	2016-04-05T13:54:15	PIrelandatBC daylight clearing and settlement requires a very small amount of reserves relative to what's outstanding.
1954swilliamson	717104436783349761	2016-04-04T21:39:55	PIrelandatBC the only reason the positive spread can be maintained is lack of arbitrage - as in the U.S.
1954swilliamson	717087071777632256	2016-04-04T20:30:55	PIrelandatBC So, whatever the interest rate on reserves, it's a liquidity trap.
1954swilliamson	717086769850687488	2016-04-04T20:29:43	PIrelandatBC If reserves bear interest and have roughly the same properties as T-bills, then swaps of reserves for T-bills should be ntrl.

1954swilliamson	717028263458025472	2016-04-04T16:37:14	PIrelandatBC usual problems of course. why do you think so highly of this measure of "money?" Are you the last of the quantity theorists?
1954swilliamson	716990328721375232	2016-04-04T14:06:30	for a quantity theorist, 6% money growth, 2% GDP growth, and 2% inflation target should spell tightening.

1954swilliamson	714897279941881856	2016-03-29T19:29:28	Noahpinion easy. the government likes mandates that have no direct implications for the government budget.
1954swilliamson	714896430779932672	2016-03-29T19:26:05	Noahpinion There seems to be a legitimate role for government somewhere in there. Not sure it has anything to do with legislating wages.
1954swilliamson	714881487493943296	2016-03-29T18:26:43	Noahpinion So the problem is empathy. Better work on the parents and friends. Or Mary needs a support group.

1954swilliamson	714878752262529024	2016-03-29T18:15:51	Noahpinion For example, some say that Americans need to feel more dignified relative to others in the world. Are you on board with that?
1954swilliamson	714878019689558016	2016-03-29T18:12:56	Noahpinion Dignity as a goal seems fine. What gets done in the cause of dignity is another thing.

1954swilliamson	714811188752809984	2016-03-29T13:47:22	Noahpinion the aggregate quantity of dignity is unlimited. People tell me that Cubans are really happy and dignified. Also really poor.

1954swilliamson	714621395162894336	2016-03-29T01:13:12	Noahpinion so taxing carbon to subsidize McDonalds would be a hard sell, but somehow a minimum wage seems like a free lunch.
1954swilliamson	714618526103785472	2016-03-29T01:01:48	Noahpinion equivalent to taxing firms hiring low-skilled workers, in order to finance a subsidy to low-skilled workers.
1954swilliamson	714617613695848448	2016-03-29T00:58:10	Noahpinion sure. basically a redistribution with a deadweight loss. So, there isn't enough to compensate the losers.
1954swilliamson	714581449798582272	2016-03-28T22:34:28	Noahpinion measured emp effects are short run. long-run adjs are: substitute K and high-skilled L for low-skilled L; go out of business.

1954swilliamson	712653414606331904	2016-03-23T14:53:09	kocherlakota009 t0nyyates seems an example of how foreward guidance can go wrong - too much talk (and changing talk) sows confusion.
1954swilliamson	712637510648606720	2016-03-23T13:49:57	kocherlakota009 t0nyyates you want people to understand the policy rule. people think an instrument forecast is a commitment.

1954swilliamson	711994216667226112	2016-03-21T19:13:44	C_Trombley1 Noahpinion seems a bad definition. some quite school at 16. some go to grad school and don't get out until 40.

1954swilliamson	711905320503672832	2016-03-21T13:20:29	t0nyyates a few days ago, I sighted a leprechaun.
1954swilliamson	711674186402377728	2016-03-20T22:02:02	Noahpinion that was annoying.

1954swilliamson	709450095998054402	2016-03-14T18:44:18	Noahpinion We Canadians are very upbeat and positive :)
1954swilliamson	709448908355731456	2016-03-14T18:39:35	t0nyyates That's actually a plausible outcome from this whole process. CBs, unable to increase inflation, lower their targets to save face.

1954swilliamson	708299250954686464	2016-03-11T14:31:15	MacRoweNick i can show you a model where the CB experiments, sees a negative correlation between R and pi, and the world is actually NF.
1954swilliamson	708298464959062016	2016-03-11T14:28:08	MacRoweNick and it's the belief that R down means pi up that causes all these central banks to get stuck, and perpetually miss on low side.
1954swilliamson	708296832791613440	2016-03-11T14:21:39	MacRoweNick Sure, if they actually nailed inflation to the target, the correlation would be zero. But they don't.

1954swilliamson	689549445348732928	2016-01-19T20:46:13	Noahpinion farmerrf Well, it's a general problem. Start with something that can explain anything, and then restrict the structure.
1954swilliamson	689544774622191616	2016-01-19T20:27:40	farmerrf I guess I'm more of a purist. There's a model, and it has equilibria. Adaptive learning rules is another model.
1954swilliamson	689496098776346625	2016-01-19T17:14:14	farmerrf Yes, I know that's what you've been saying. To me that looks like equilibrium selection - the modeler gets to choose the beliefs.
1954swilliamson	689493443127554048	2016-01-19T17:03:41	farmerrf So, empiricism helps us to choose among equilibria. Seems OK. But beliefs are endogenous - we can't just choose to make them exog.
1954swilliamson	689485118621089792	2016-01-19T16:30:36	farmerrf There's some discipline on the choice of a utility function, eg what we know about risk aversion. Why choose among equilibria?

1954swilliamson	688862232805949440	2016-01-17T23:15:29	DavidBeckworth I still say that's a lot of QE with little effect.

1954swilliamson	688811885437689856	2016-01-17T19:55:25	dandolfa (i) You could evaluate these like you would any forecasting model. See how they perform "out of sample."
1954swilliamson	688810370408960000	2016-01-17T19:49:24	DavidBeckworth The BOJ set a goal of 2% inflation by April 2015. By any measure they fell short, and are continuing to do so.
1954swilliamson	688781646900760576	2016-01-17T17:55:16	t0nyyates dandolfa Here's the Cleveland Fed's inflation expectations measure. This might be similar: 
1954swilliamson	688780808358776833	2016-01-17T17:51:56	t0nyyates dandolfa looks like they split the sample. But, do we believe the model? I thought term structure models were no good.
1954swilliamson	688779769656156160	2016-01-17T17:47:48	dandolfa Questions: (i) are the market-based measures any good? (ii) is the Atlanta Fed measure any good?
1954swilliamson	688778331798413312	2016-01-17T17:42:05	DavidBeckworth Here, they strip out tax effects:  Still little action on inflation given a lot of QE.
1954swilliamson	688776061090312192	2016-01-17T17:33:04	DavidBeckworth headline CPI shows essentially no inflation in Japan since spring 2014. Not sure what you're talking about.
1954swilliamson	688517755708944384	2016-01-17T00:26:39	Started out with central bank liabilities, on to inflation targets, low breakevens, and ... neo-Fishersim. 
1954swilliamson	688448742932922368	2016-01-16T19:52:25	dandolfa kocherlakota009 Too formal though. NK needs to shed his central banker image.
1954swilliamson	688447536663691264	2016-01-16T19:47:38	farmerrf You could say that relative asset supplies matter in some circumstances. Usual one is an OMO, but there can be more.
1954swilliamson	688446833459240960	2016-01-16T19:44:50	Noahpinion Well, it conforms to some kind of accounting conventions. Things add up, the balance sheet balances, etc.
1954swilliamson	688400760942407680	2016-01-16T16:41:45	Noahpinion Yes, reserves and currency appear on the "liablilities" side of the Fed's balance sheet, but aren't promises. Reverse repos are.

1954swilliamson	687457354535718912	2016-01-14T02:13:00	Noahpinion Sure, different models for different purposes. What's new?
