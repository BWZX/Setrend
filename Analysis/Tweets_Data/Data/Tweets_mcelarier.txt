mcelarier	710252492152512512	2016-03-16T23:52:44	DorsiaCapital I think (&amp; have told him) that being fully invested because he went public was a mistake. Needs cash to buy at the bottom.
mcelarier	710251967176638464	2016-03-16T23:50:39	DorsiaCapital But his overall record is still stunning. 13ds up 152% vs 11% for S&amp;P500. Better than Icahn. And he has terrible PR.
