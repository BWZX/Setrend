dandolfa	726218136475803648	2016-04-30T01:14:30	aantonop I can this for secured credit, but not unsecured. For the latter, reputation/identity is indispensable, no?

dandolfa	712749118053945345	2016-03-23T21:13:26	dandolfa I think we are using the term "credibility," too loosely, and worry it will come back to bite us if pi is 50bp greater than 2%.

dandolfa	712669765085495296	2016-03-23T15:58:07	emiliomanfred t0nyyates Sure. But what does this have to do with the dot plots?
dandolfa	712667380351012864	2016-03-23T15:48:38	t0nyyates But history shows repeatedly that it can be done with inflation: 
dandolfa	712667002632994816	2016-03-23T15:47:08	t0nyyates Sure.
dandolfa	712666618787049473	2016-03-23T15:45:37	t0nyyates It's confusing, talk is cheap, and nobody cares (apart from bond traders and journalists). :)
dandolfa	712666327958196225	2016-03-23T15:44:27	t0nyyates Inflation target is one thing. Forward guidance on nominal interest rates is another.
dandolfa	712666176409575425	2016-03-23T15:43:51	t0nyyates But why promise an interest rate path? Why not just stick to what a CB can control (more or less)?
dandolfa	712665777862680577	2016-03-23T15:42:16	MarcoMNYC JoshZumbrun t0nyyates Agreed. What do you think about Fed's commitment to 2% long-run inflation target?
dandolfa	712665534370713600	2016-03-23T15:41:18	t0nyyates I don't understand. Low and stable inflation a worthwhile goal. It was painful to achieve the credibility, but arguably worth it.
dandolfa	712658358952538112	2016-03-23T15:12:47	t0nyyates We have 30+ years of reputation backing up the inflation target. I take that as reputation capital. Fed would not risk losing it.
dandolfa	712657701424070656	2016-03-23T15:10:11	t0nyyates Remember the unemployment threshold? What happened with that?
dandolfa	712657599825444865	2016-03-23T15:09:46	t0nyyates I believe only in time-consistent policy.
dandolfa	712657456975884293	2016-03-23T15:09:12	t0nyyates It would all be time-inconsistent blather. Why bother?
dandolfa	712657232916119552	2016-03-23T15:08:19	t0nyyates I don't need to shift any long rates around!
dandolfa	712656472992124929	2016-03-23T15:05:18	t0nyyates It may not be enough, but it's all a CB has. And it's based on the reputation built over 30 years of low and stable inflation.
dandolfa	712655959223439360	2016-03-23T15:03:15	t0nyyates We already *know* that Fed will change R to hit inflation target. We can count on that! What else do you need to know?
dandolfa	712655669753556993	2016-03-23T15:02:06	kocherlakota009 t0nyyates I have no doubt that inappropriate increases in R can have bad effects! Not my point.
dandolfa	712655407391477760	2016-03-23T15:01:04	t0nyyates Dot plots are not state-contingent policy. Only time-consistent policy should matter. Forward guidance on path not credible.
dandolfa	712654984635002880	2016-03-23T14:59:23	kocherlakota009 t0nyyates Question is whether they view forward guidance as *credible.*
dandolfa	712654872303173632	2016-03-23T14:58:56	t0nyyates See my earlier comment. Dot plots (forward guidance) not credible. But inflation target is.
dandolfa	712654651678588929	2016-03-23T14:58:04	t0nyyates I should have also added, dot plots are not credible. Inflation target is.
dandolfa	712654400922062848	2016-03-23T14:57:04	Birdyword Right! :)
dandolfa	712654336019472384	2016-03-23T14:56:48	t0nyyates That information is subsumed in low and stable inflation, no?
dandolfa	712653940085514240	2016-03-23T14:55:14	Who (apart from bond traders) cares about the dot plots? Fed has credibility on most important dimension: long-term inflation target.
dandolfa	712653472034721792	2016-03-23T14:53:22	Disagree with t0nyyates on the dot plots, but agree that there are a lot of misguided views of mon. pol. out there!

dandolfa	693539407958179840	2016-01-30T21:00:54	ProfSteveKeen But QE has nothing to do with currency in circulation. QE is a swap of interest-bearing debt for interest-bearing reserves.
dandolfa	693539230241296384	2016-01-30T21:00:12	ProfSteveKeen Yes, true if the interest rate on deposits equals the interest rate on currency, which is close to present circumstances.

dandolfa	693499677153439744	2016-01-30T18:23:02	dr_nrl ProfSteveKeen And if stuff includes rise in P, then more reserves will be converted into currency in circulation.
dandolfa	693499413151416320	2016-01-30T18:21:59	dr_nrl ProfSteveKeen Banks can certainly lend reserves to each other. In their collective effort to economize on them, stuff can happen.

dandolfa	693358345382555648	2016-01-30T09:01:26	ProfSteveKeen Well, if lowering R causes the asset price level to rise, the expected return to investment should rise too, no?
dandolfa	693354623692705793	2016-01-30T08:46:38	ProfSteveKeen &amp; even if banks can't collectively dispose of reserves, the reduced demand will decrease their real value via higher P level.

dandolfa	691887430882967552	2016-01-26T07:36:32	Noahpinion No, does not mean this at all. They may have same fundamentals in mind and believe they're buying at bargain prices.
dandolfa	691887162833408001	2016-01-26T07:35:28	Noahpinion So, speculators only drive prices down and not up?
dandolfa	691886637446479873	2016-01-26T07:33:23	Noahpinion Sure. But then headline could have read "Fundamental traders are not just going long the currency; they're buying China itself."
dandolfa	691885879162507266	2016-01-26T07:30:22	Noahpinion Not weird. But if diff. types of speculators are buying &amp; selling China, then "speculators" is not a meaningful adjective here.

dandolfa	689631560388063232	2016-01-20T02:12:31	munilass So agency should have know this ex ante is what you are saying. What ratings were attached to the bonds in question?
dandolfa	689629424715608064	2016-01-20T02:04:02	munilass Being wrong ex post cannot be the criterion, at least, not entirely...since even a high rating does not imply risk free.
dandolfa	689629252006780928	2016-01-20T02:03:21	munilass Um, no. I'm actually curious. When should bond raters be held liable for their ratings?
dandolfa	689628431798009856	2016-01-20T02:00:05	munilass Not insolvent 100%, but surely, there are states of the world in which insolvency may occur, no? Being wrong ex post not a crime.

dandolfa	688794174204739584	2016-01-17T18:45:02	ericbeebo Chris_arnade modestproposal1 Sure. But I'm asking you: where is the evidence on default losses from AAA rated securities?

dandolfa	688789840792436741	2016-01-17T18:27:49	modestproposal1 Chris_arnade ...rating agencies where not expected to rate liquidity risk, and most AAA did pay off (losses were small).
dandolfa	688789698852962304	2016-01-17T18:27:15	modestproposal1 Chris_arnade Not trolling. Let me explain. Of course we know liquidity of AAA rated MBS evaporated, but...
dandolfa	688789108651524096	2016-01-17T18:24:55	Chris_arnade modestproposal1 What is the evidence that this led to badly rated securities? Favorite examples?
dandolfa	688788845836374016	2016-01-17T18:23:52	soncharm IMAO_ GatewayEcon The same is true of word models. My point is that his claim of an "economic law" purporting result is false.

dandolfa	688219571782746113	2016-01-16T04:41:47	davealevine I don't deny that. The question is by how much. Note: there were natural market forces bringing yields down independent of QE.

dandolfa	687022877925859329	2016-01-12T21:26:33	boes_ Wouldn't that be true even if MMF purchased UST from Fed in outright sale? MMF instructs bank to make payment to Fed.

dandolfa	683460067165732866	2016-01-03T01:29:12	FriedrichHayek But standard neoclassical theory answers that question, and in the same way you do, apparently. So what are we arguing?
dandolfa	683459812588261377	2016-01-03T01:28:12	FriedrichHayek Now you tell me...lol.
dandolfa	683459644128247808	2016-01-03T01:27:31	FriedrichHayek We know that demand for housing falls as R rises. But that follows from standard neoclassical theory.
dandolfa	683458777710858240	2016-01-03T01:24:05	PeterBoettke FriedrichHayek Is there a mathematical Hayekian model out there somewhere?

dandolfa	683458122699022340	2016-01-03T01:21:29	FriedrichHayek OK. But now, can you point to empirical evidence suggesting substitution between short + long gestation projects as fn of R?

dandolfa	683453492271263744	2016-01-03T01:03:05	FriedrichHayek Sure, that's standard intertemporal choice theory. Increase R makes present consumption more expensive, so you save more.

dandolfa	683444588263047168	2016-01-03T00:27:42	FriedrichHayek 2./ Ceteris paribus, higher interest rate induces shorter gestation projects (and lower returns). Low interest rate -&gt; opp.
dandolfa	683444393160781824	2016-01-03T00:26:55	FriedrichHayek 1./ OK. If I understand theory correctly (and I may not), investment opportunities can be ranked by gestation period.
dandolfa	683444064667090944	2016-01-03T00:25:37	FriedrichHayek Am aware of intertemporal choice theory and role of interest rate in timing consumption. That's not what my question asks.
dandolfa	683443413652385792	2016-01-03T00:23:02	FriedrichHayek That's true of any capital good. Was not what I was asking. Please read my question. Does it make sense to you?
dandolfa	683443134085201920	2016-01-03T00:21:55	FriedrichHayek So, rather than conversing with someone open to understanding your view, you'd rather repeatedly point out their ignorance.
dandolfa	683442643917910018	2016-01-03T00:19:58	FriedrichHayek I meant "seriously, are you blind to the snide remarks that decorate your replies to honest questions?"
dandolfa	683441915556007936	2016-01-03T00:17:05	FriedrichHayek So, in the 1980s (high interest rates), people built homes more quickly? And now (low R), we take longer?
dandolfa	683440592647372800	2016-01-03T00:11:49	FriedrichHayek Um...seriously? 
dandolfa	683440164803182592	2016-01-03T00:10:07	FriedrichHayek So if interest rate rises (all along the yield curve, short end, long end?), then substitute into shorter-maturity projects?
dandolfa	683439921537744896	2016-01-03T00:09:09	FriedrichHayek Yes, I have. I did not ask you whether I have bought a house.
dandolfa	683439417478926336	2016-01-03T00:07:09	FriedrichHayek All you are telling me is that you're unable to answer a simple, honest question, except with nasty side remarks.
dandolfa	683420154194071552	2016-01-02T22:50:36	FriedrichHayek Can you give a few real-world examples where interest rate structure influences choice of goods over "rival lengths?" Thx.
