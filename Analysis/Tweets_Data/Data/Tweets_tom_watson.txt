tom_watson	709662689036001280	2016-03-15T08:49:04	DavidAllenGreen David, we both know cross examination on Twitter if fairly unproductive but yes, those points will be played out in debate.
tom_watson	709662385032790016	2016-03-15T08:47:52	rgarner DavidAllenGreen I can do that but not right now as I don't have the list to hand. Andy Burnham will outline this in the Commons.
tom_watson	709661522151260160	2016-03-15T08:44:26	reddeviljp Watch the debates today and you may glean a bit from my recent twitter feed.
tom_watson	709661382682214401	2016-03-15T08:43:53	riptari aral Without a doubt.
tom_watson	709661242034626561	2016-03-15T08:43:19	DavidAllenGreen Of course David. We seek to significantly improve safeguards. Why not see the Second Reading debate and follow up?
tom_watson	709660995694809088	2016-03-15T08:42:20	ballantine70 yes, I strongly agree.
tom_watson	709660425189769216	2016-03-15T08:40:04	rgarner adrianshort _ryantk aral It's just like that sometimes. 
tom_watson	709660122096730112	2016-03-15T08:38:52	mariafarrell halhod aral It sometimes stretches the contours but it's down to use to make the case!
tom_watson	709659947995373572	2016-03-15T08:38:11	kapowaz I think you're right Ben.
tom_watson	709659850976927744	2016-03-15T08:37:47	aral halhod To repeat, this is not 'inability', it's a tactic. And you are no Sun Tzu with that proposition.
tom_watson	709659402991755264	2016-03-15T08:36:01	adrianshort _ryantk rgarner aral How do you think I can find common cause with them if we oppose everything on day one?
tom_watson	709659277301059584	2016-03-15T08:35:31	adrianshort _ryantk rgarner aral Ah, thanks for noticing "Tory Rebels". Do you think they are opposing today?
tom_watson	709658802556108800	2016-03-15T08:33:38	_ryantk adrianshort rgarner aral In it's current form that's precisely what we want. But we don't have the numbers.
tom_watson	709658536507269120	2016-03-15T08:32:34	mariafarrell halhod aral I opposed the last one outright on the grounds it wasn't debated. And now it can be, you want me not to engage!
tom_watson	709658258831773696	2016-03-15T08:31:28	aral halhod Please clarify what you mean by that statement? I don't understand what manoeuvring you mena.
tom_watson	709657962684522496	2016-03-15T08:30:17	adrianshort rgarner aral No. We forfeit all positions if we do. That let's everyone down. Even you.
tom_watson	709657572169613312	2016-03-15T08:28:44	halhod aral The Bill was only recently published. The spin has been with us for years. There is a lot of committee wrangling to go.
tom_watson	709657386160672768	2016-03-15T08:28:00	w1bble timb_machine Do you think that jeremycorbyn doesn't know how to oppose? We are seeking to change this Bill in the best way we can.
tom_watson	709656504660586496	2016-03-15T08:24:30	halhod aral It's only the opening debate today, that's what a second reading is. The detail happens in committee and at report stage.
tom_watson	709656276658208769	2016-03-15T08:23:35	w1bble timb_machine Please define "meaningful response".
tom_watson	709656087608369152	2016-03-15T08:22:50	aral I can demonstrate spine every day and lose every position but it won't help anyone, even you, with all your swearing and bluster.
tom_watson	709655548048842752	2016-03-15T08:20:42	kapowaz Well I think if it goes through unamended, our party conference may well decide to do that. But it's early days.
tom_watson	709655346722250752	2016-03-15T08:19:54	rgarner aral Yes and Andy Burnham's team are talking to the industry about their concerns.
tom_watson	709655121685323776	2016-03-15T08:19:00	jheawood Yes, I probably should. It's not the conversation that is tiring. It's the same conversation 100 times.
tom_watson	709654780151513092	2016-03-15T08:17:38	glynmoody raycorrigan aral I agree.
tom_watson	709654699570536449	2016-03-15T08:17:19	aral iWhat do you think the outcome will be if we did that?
tom_watson	709654344522711040	2016-03-15T08:15:55	kapowaz Yes, that's one argument we intend to deploy during the passage of the Bill.
tom_watson	709654199940878336	2016-03-15T08:15:20	aral A question should be answered in the spirit in which it is asked. Throwing your toys out of the pram will not help the cause.
tom_watson	709653891760128000	2016-03-15T08:14:07	kapowaz I agree. We're in opposition though. We don't have a majority. Please try to be politics-savvy.
tom_watson	709653307900370944	2016-03-15T08:11:47	RegulatoryZen This is about tactics. Better to make the case for the safeguards as outline in three recent reports.
tom_watson	709652437825675264	2016-03-15T08:08:20	timb_machine Remember how little leverage we have in opposition. We don't decide timing, content and priorities for legislation.
tom_watson	709652166923964416	2016-03-15T08:07:15	rgarner aral At it's elemental level, yes. You know, I should write a social media guide on the passage of a Bill.
tom_watson	709651266364907520	2016-03-15T08:03:41	DavidTWeaver I say that to myself every morning.
tom_watson	709650908418805762	2016-03-15T08:02:15	rgarner aral We could do that but it makes it much harder, maybe impossible, to find agreement with our opponents on improvement.
tom_watson	709650554415411200	2016-03-15T08:00:51	rgarner aral If we build our case for changes and seek alliances with Con MPs, we may force improvements. You have to engage to do that.
tom_watson	709650246511546369	2016-03-15T07:59:38	rgarner aral We cannot win if we vote against it today. We don't have a majority. If we oppose now the government will just railroad it.
tom_watson	709649820479315968	2016-03-15T07:57:56	e3i5 raycorrigan aral Unfortunately parliamentary convention dictates that I can't. It's not the department I shadow.
tom_watson	709649604225191936	2016-03-15T07:57:04	rgarner aral Hah. I love techies. It's not a mechanism. It's about how you engage and deploy your arguments.
tom_watson	709649220576399361	2016-03-15T07:55:33	raycorrigan glynmoody aral Believe me I know about the problems. This Bill can be made less worse though. And that is worth attempting.
tom_watson	709648500884111360	2016-03-15T07:52:41	rgarner aral Yes,that's exactly what I'm saying.Between all the opposition parties we don't have a majority.We have to negotiate with HMG.
tom_watson	709648204040683520	2016-03-15T07:51:31	rgarner aral That's the judgement call. Oppose and it goes through in it's current form. Engage and it might be less worse/better.
tom_watson	709647801605627904	2016-03-15T07:49:55	rgarner aral This is much harder to explain on social media but it's the best chance of getting improvements in Parliament.
tom_watson	709647632596135936	2016-03-15T07:49:14	rgarner aral It's a call you have to make. We are engaging with the government to seek improvements.
tom_watson	709647305033588736	2016-03-15T07:47:56	rgarner aral We are fighting, in our own way. It's only the second reading debate today. When it goes to committee we will try to amend it
tom_watson	709646757551054848	2016-03-15T07:45:46	rgarner aral I'm not defending this Bill. It's in poor shape.We are going to try to improve it. Why not see the debate and get back to me?
tom_watson	709646345771077632	2016-03-15T07:44:08	fjfish DavidTWeaver In opposition we have to negotiate. If we fail, we will oppose at later stages. If we oppose now, they win anyway.

tom_watson	709644788371480576	2016-03-15T07:37:56	rgarner aral My goal is not to understand tech more, but to explain politics to techies. Opposition requires tactics. We have no power.
tom_watson	709644240826048512	2016-03-15T07:35:46	DavidTWeaver it's terrible for this! Have a look at the opening speeches today and let me know if you need anything else after that.
tom_watson	709643973032280064	2016-03-15T07:34:42	DavidTWeaver If the Bill is not improved, we'll oppose it, yes. We seek to improve it in committee and at report stage. Early days.
