munilass	725437097088290816	2016-04-27T21:30:56	And that's a difficult case to make in the absence of meaningful, well distributed economic growth.

munilass	725436727259729920	2016-04-27T21:29:28	One really good point Trump made is that you can't commit yourself to intervention without being willing to commit resources.
munilass	725436580274556930	2016-04-27T21:28:53	For example, I'd love to see her respond to criticism that interventions have left chaos in their wake and how that could be avoided.

munilass	716989590377259008	2016-04-04T14:03:34	Tax structure often determined by political philosophy - whether burden of government is centralized or takes place at local level.
munilass	716989419119648768	2016-04-04T14:02:53	Sometimes taxes at local level more than make up for the absence of a particular tax at state level.

munilass	716988815102058496	2016-04-04T14:00:29	That's another pet peeve of mine in tax talk. States levy different kinds of taxes. 
munilass	716988661695397888	2016-04-04T13:59:52	Hopefully what will come out of panamapapers episode is that tax structure is one thing, but actually collecting taxes is also important.

munilass	716987837506273280	2016-04-04T13:56:36	True - can't attribute success or failure of revenue forecasts / appearance of budget gaps entirely to tax policy 
munilass	716987558362787840	2016-04-04T13:55:29	Which are the easiest taxes to levy politically, but you can't build a budget off of them.

munilass	716987302510272512	2016-04-04T13:54:28	Part of the problem with what Kansas did as far as tax cuts was concerned was apply them disproportionately to specific groups.
munilass	716986973722906624	2016-04-04T13:53:10	Also, you have to separate out the effects of economic trends (what is happening in energy sector, for example) from tax structure.
munilass	716986820316307456	2016-04-04T13:52:33	But you can't compare state/local tax structures with federal government. One has to balance budget.
munilass	716986687277166592	2016-04-04T13:52:01	I agree with the sentiment that it is unwise for a state or local government to give up tax revenue arbitrarily.

munilass	714895753488048128	2016-03-29T19:23:24	Only reason to use CABs is to give greater fool the delusion that made you buy bonds - that legal protection overrides credit fundamentals.
munilass	714895579344736262	2016-03-29T19:22:42	If you legitimately thought the economic growth was going to be there, you would be fine with growth bonds, not CABs. Hence greater fool.
munilass	714895401464295424	2016-03-29T19:22:00	Right 
munilass	714895254944669696	2016-03-29T19:21:25	Absolutely, 100% yes 
munilass	714894698549264384	2016-03-29T19:19:12	It's just going to be some new set of investors (and still taxpayers') problem then. This is antisocial behavior. No other word for it.
munilass	714894433456623620	2016-03-29T19:18:09	The whole point of this situation is that the debt is unaffordable. It is not going to be more affordable when multiplied over time.
munilass	714894184453382145	2016-03-29T19:17:10	Oh, the CABs won't pay out either. They are for the greater fools, next push for bankruptcy legislation. 
munilass	714893945340301312	2016-03-29T19:16:13	That's a ridiculous drag on state and local economies just so some bad investors can push some paper around.
munilass	714893652334612481	2016-03-29T19:15:03	It's all good and fine if companies want to use them and investors can deal with consequences. In public finance, all pushed on to taxpayers
munilass	714893470628978690	2016-03-29T19:14:20	I used to have a laissez-faire attitude about innovative products, but after watching the debt spirals they create - they need to be banned.
munilass	714893018948624384	2016-03-29T19:12:32	But if you are a government that wants to transition to a more sustainable financial situation and grow economy, just another time bomb.
munilass	714892877546000387	2016-03-29T19:11:58	CABs do not make debt affordable. They delay its un-affordability. If you are an investor who wants an exit strategy, that's fine. +
munilass	714892674147487744	2016-03-29T19:11:10	Probably the worst thing that could happen with Puerto Rico is for government to transition debt structure to CABs then borrow more.
munilass	714892423906856960	2016-03-29T19:10:10	If you want to understand why that deal is convenient in short-term (for creditors) and reckless long-term, here 
munilass	714890307075178496	2016-03-29T19:01:45	They just want to toss the liability off into future, let someone else deal with the next catastrophe. This market really is out of control.
munilass	714889874650828800	2016-03-29T19:00:02	As I have said a million times, outside of project finance, that is an abusive structure.
munilass	714889599890407424	2016-03-29T18:58:57	Debt of Puerto Rico’s largest authority is already substantially all CABs.
munilass	714889336458711040	2016-03-29T18:57:54	Replace growth bonds w/ CABs = we just want an exit strategy; something to push off to greater fools 
munilass	714857200150319104	2016-03-29T16:50:12	InterestArb We are *years* into all levels of government no longer being a drag on economy.

munilass	714800242110107649	2016-03-29T13:03:52	The municipal market needs a real division of responsibilities and clear, logical standards for the various roles people play in deals.
munilass	714799930641104896	2016-03-29T13:02:38	Creating bad rules and not enforcing the good ones doesn't fix the Wild West of the muni market. It makes it worse.
munilass	714799553447346176	2016-03-29T13:01:08	Which is something that is beyond them professionally, with respect to standards and expertise.
munilass	714799383695532032	2016-03-29T13:00:28	And instead, regulators are talking about having advisors usurp the disclosure responsibilities of issuers and their attorneys.
munilass	714799166669602816	2016-03-29T12:59:36	Judging by the deals that are taking place nowadays, it is questionable whether the added regulation has had much of an effect.
munilass	714798953104064512	2016-03-29T12:58:45	That was in wake of the financial crisis blowing up all the synthetic fixed rate deals that were being pitched, auction rate securities, etc
munilass	714798645837697024	2016-03-29T12:57:32	The reason for authority over municipal advisors is to prevent municipalities from getting destructive advice. +
munilass	714795434301112320	2016-03-29T12:44:46	"Longest-dated muni bonds haven’t looked this expensive since before 2008 financial crisis"  
munilass	714794315474739200	2016-03-29T12:40:19	But I am sure someone will explain that to the MSRB in their request for comments.
munilass	714793981419384833	2016-03-29T12:39:00	I suspect that the first municipal advisor to comply with that arrangement will find themselves quickly on the wrong side of legal system.
munilass	714793589600088064	2016-03-29T12:37:26	I think additional disclosure is great, but I also think the MSRB is a little confused about what a fiduciary duty standard means.
munilass	714793438600904705	2016-03-29T12:36:50	That is, whether the government has been taking on additional debt in the form of direct lending rather than regulated securities.
munilass	714793269629202433	2016-03-29T12:36:10	So the MSRB wants to use its authority over municipal advisors to get them to disclose information that governments otherwise wouldn't.
munilass	714791966995836928	2016-03-29T12:30:59	Approximately no one is sympathetic with sovereignty arguments when you are asking for financial relief. 
munilass	714788746433019904	2016-03-29T12:18:11	JoeMysak But Puerto Rico is asking for federal assistance - absolutely should lose control, as with similar cases.
munilass	714788374687707136	2016-03-29T12:16:43	JoeMysak Only way municipality in Chapter 9 loses control is if state has parallel regime (like emergency manager law).

munilass	710530363232292864	2016-03-17T18:16:54	You can kind of see that two ways. There has been a decrease in issuance by higher quality issuers.
munilass	710530202225528832	2016-03-17T18:16:15	(2) They wouldn't get an investment grade rating anyway and don't want to pay for the analysis.
munilass	710530051700367360	2016-03-17T18:15:39	(1) The issuer is small and rarely goes to market. They don't need the ratings expense. Likely picked up locally.
munilass	710529895068258304	2016-03-17T18:15:02	That is typically a very small sliver of the muni market. There are basically two reasons a muni issuer sells unrated debt.
munilass	710529687857012740	2016-03-17T18:14:13	MMA: Approximately 13% of muni issuance in 2016 has been either unrated or rated no higher than the equivalent of BBB+.
munilass	710529539307393024	2016-03-17T18:13:37	Per MMA, there was 116% increase in low or unrated bonds through mid-March.
munilass	710529332758843392	2016-03-17T18:12:48	MMA quantified my argument that a lot of the bonds being sold now have been by lower rated muni issuers.
munilass	710528936862740486	2016-03-17T18:11:14	No matter how necessary infrastructure investment may be, it's running behind restoring programs and retirees.
munilass	710528793966936064	2016-03-17T18:10:40	Also why people who are predicting an uptick in new money issuance this year will likely be wrong. Pensions are eating all growth.
munilass	710528604627673088	2016-03-17T18:09:54	Fascinating - days each state could run on reserve funds  States far more vulnerable to recession than people think.

munilass	707666532617203713	2016-03-09T20:37:03	NickTimiraos Because it is unserious, ridiculous content.
munilass	707663262330957824	2016-03-09T20:24:04	NickTimiraos I suspect media executives will take a hard look at their content as pushback intensifies too.
munilass	707663262330916864	2016-03-09T20:24:04	NickTimiraos I think there is a clear establishment bias in news coverage on both right and left.
munilass	707661709675261952	2016-03-09T20:17:53	Well, you are trying to anyway. Your coverage doesn't even remotely reflect how people are voting, even after the unrelenting spin cycle.
munilass	707661438203068417	2016-03-09T20:16:49	Frustrating change is what lobbyists do. You are doing same thing for way less money.
munilass	707661305843417088	2016-03-09T20:16:17	And if you would have told me a year ago that media would be pawns for people who live from one govt shutdown / debt ceiling to another...
munilass	707660779219189761	2016-03-09T20:14:12	Clear establishment bias in media on both the right and left. Opposite of what journalism is supposed to be.  
munilass	707660558460436481	2016-03-09T20:13:19	In fact, I'm not even sure what they think that means.
munilass	707660186442399744	2016-03-09T20:11:50	"It's called writing" is not a defense that will get very far with people who view journalism as a business.  
munilass	707659708996427776	2016-03-09T20:09:56	But the media is manufacturing a freak show. At some point, discipline will be introduced. You can't alienate everyone.
munilass	707659516188495873	2016-03-09T20:09:10	These are candidates that are not attracting fringe voters. They are doing well across demographics.
munilass	707658967095369728	2016-03-09T20:07:00	I can see that happening with political coverage too. Because right now, mainstream coverage is the same or worse than talk radio.
munilass	707658757719908352	2016-03-09T20:06:10	At Bloomberg, a conscious decision was made to put an end to hysterical coverage of the financial sector. And that improved quality.
munilass	707658622239698944	2016-03-09T20:05:37	I can see media executives taking steps to change tone of coverage much like what happened at Bloomberg.
munilass	707658462575120384	2016-03-09T20:04:59	Like I posted yesterday, Washington Post was running negative articles about Sanders every hour ahead of primary. Not just Trump issue.
munilass	707658320551796736	2016-03-09T20:04:25	I suspect that after the election or even during the general election, the powers that be in the media will take a hard look at coverage.
munilass	707652186730315777	2016-03-09T19:40:03	NickTimiraos At some point, even mainstream news outlets need to give up on the notion that they are any better than talk radio.
munilass	707652034049273859	2016-03-09T19:39:27	NickTimiraos Also, as I posted yesterday, Washington Post ran 16 negative articles about Sanders in 16 hours ahead of primary.
munilass	707651069053042689	2016-03-09T19:35:37	NickTimiraos Hearing conversations about Trump like that on NPR was a stunning experience. That's not Hannity.
munilass	707650407602921472	2016-03-09T19:32:59	NickTimiraos Like NPR?

munilass	707648189164232704	2016-03-09T19:24:10	NickTimiraos Caller after caller on *all of them* was saying that the media hounding their candidate only reinforced their opinions.
munilass	707647590418911232	2016-03-09T19:21:47	NickTimiraos I listened to talk radio on my drive from Kentucky to Georgia on Friday. From NPR to conservative channels.
munilass	707637684533989376	2016-03-09T18:42:25	Because these primaries are kind of a referendum on media coverage in their own right.
munilass	707637280920317952	2016-03-09T18:40:49	One does have to believe that the spectacular failures in election coverage will lead to big changes in media companies going forward.
munilass	707630311673176065	2016-03-09T18:13:08	This would be a fantastic time to launch an alternative news venue.

munilass	707620504916664320	2016-03-09T17:34:09	NickTimiraos Hahaha. Big difference between Rubio and Cantor though. Cantor had his hands in everything finance folks find important.
munilass	707618211479592960	2016-03-09T17:25:03	This is why Christie and Paul jumped out early on. They know how to survive. Rubio's just a kid.
munilass	707617911377170434	2016-03-09T17:23:51	You're probably right. His political career has been nuked by an establishment desperate to keep someone in the race 
munilass	707617479087005696	2016-03-09T17:22:08	And the fact that the Republicans have two candidates willing to do that shows how terrible and disconnected the strategists are right now.
munilass	707617289890361345	2016-03-09T17:21:23	Losing your home state is a special form of ridicule. Any future opponent will cite it as a failure to adequately represent state.
munilass	707616571158634500	2016-03-09T17:18:32	That's the one thing all these folks don't get. He's a hopeless cause for president. But his survival depends on future statewide support.
munilass	707615816292896772	2016-03-09T17:15:32	Rubio's going to be a victim of his own yes men. Lose in his home state, and he'll be finished politically.

munilass	705603863257202688	2016-03-04T04:00:45	I would argue that immigration in context of physical borders is very different than refugee question.
munilass	705603385135857664	2016-03-04T03:58:51	I don't know, I almost think he exposes how complicated immigration is, and in ways that are often ignored. 
munilass	705602525811109888	2016-03-04T03:55:26	Indeed, just bombastic delivery

munilass	705601914013163524	2016-03-04T03:53:00	I've said this a million times, but if you bracket off immigration, Trump is the most centrist candidate in this election.
munilass	705601492410048512	2016-03-04T03:51:19	felixsalmon It was exactly his point, don't worry. I should be careful how I use quotes.
munilass	705601113563729920	2016-03-04T03:49:49	felixsalmon Actually, that was me paraphrasing him, but thanks.

munilass	705597741884416000	2016-03-04T03:36:25	Republicans in my stream are criticizing Trump for giving federalist response to question. I've seen it all now.
munilass	705596070462672896	2016-03-04T03:29:47	So you get something beyond and more detailed than the party line  
munilass	705595839897575425	2016-03-04T03:28:52	That's my goal 
munilass	705595784176209920	2016-03-04T03:28:38	I was impressed with the question, not with the answer sadly

munilass	705594269910876160	2016-03-04T03:22:37	True on both sides. Bernie represents the same exact thing.  
munilass	705593441711996928	2016-03-04T03:19:20	No, most people are not looking for a candidate to bring Washington DC back together. They want a candidate that will burn it down.

munilass	705590870595211264	2016-03-04T03:09:07	Like they've looked at masses demonstrating lack of faith in institutions and said "what the heck, let's just nuke their faith altogether."
munilass	705590672527659008	2016-03-04T03:08:20	End result of all of this: Republican voters will have lost all faith in their party/media altogether and rally behind Trump.
munilass	705590445716406273	2016-03-04T03:07:26	Fox News came into this debate trying to leverage NYT taping its sources "off the record" because they hate Trump so much.

munilass	705588614823088128	2016-03-04T03:00:09	Everyone in government wondered same thing, I'm sure  
munilass	705587082589245442	2016-03-04T02:54:04	Oh how quickly we've forgotten droning funerals 
munilass	705586564273983488	2016-03-04T02:52:00	I mean, are they really pretending our country hasn't done this already?
munilass	705586432241487873	2016-03-04T02:51:29	"They aren't going to refuse me, because they've already bombed their relatives with drones thousands of times" is better answer.
munilass	705586157682348032	2016-03-04T02:50:23	A fun question (especially being in Detroit) would be to ask the candidates about distressed municipalities.

munilass	705579949839745024	2016-03-04T02:25:43	Everyone watching just asked "You named two of the largest spending categories there. Where does that giant deficit number come from?"

munilass	705006875310424064	2016-03-02T12:28:32	The biggest threat to the muni exemption is lack of market discipline. Eventually argument will morph into "look at what we are subsidizing"
munilass	705006698692538369	2016-03-02T12:27:50	That was never a particularly good argument, since the only way govt could even pick up much was by making legislation retroactive.
munilass	705006538130395136	2016-03-02T12:27:11	The best argument against continuing the tax exemption is not that the federal government needs another source of revenue.

munilass	704470390798733312	2016-03-01T00:56:44	But many public employees are making exactly the same assumption or using exactly the same logic.
munilass	704470209936158720	2016-03-01T00:56:01	One of my biggest complaints about bondholders in recent BKs / BKs-in-waiting is that they think legal protection &gt; credit fundamentals.

munilass	704468394314223616	2016-03-01T00:48:48	Not suggesting that at all. But it is strange when they are virtually wiped out while pensions left unimpaired.  
munilass	704467909662392320	2016-03-01T00:46:52	So you have this political hurricane within the municipality, and bondholders are just collateral damage to well-established feuds.
munilass	704467684168220673	2016-03-01T00:45:58	That's one political aspect I think a lot of people miss. You have funds with gaping funding disparities, BK opportunity to rebalance.

munilass	704465732785016832	2016-03-01T00:38:13	There's also the problem of moral hazard broadly speaking. If you put into law that pensions will be treated better than bondholders +
munilass	704465564278849537	2016-03-01T00:37:33	So there's moral issue there - when you treat pensions as a bank or slush fund for labor, is it fair to treat them better than bondholders?
munilass	704465346309316609	2016-03-01T00:36:41	Philadelphia is another. Puerto Rico treated its pensions as a giant bank, for both beneficiaries and the Commonwealth.
munilass	704465205837824000	2016-03-01T00:36:08	Detroit was one, which ended in its issuing pension certificates and the holders of those being nearly wiped out.
munilass	704465041224032257	2016-03-01T00:35:28	You have a number of pension funds that already do not operate like pensions. They give beneficiaries checks based on performance, etc.
munilass	704464245182824449	2016-03-01T00:32:19	Mostly because it creates an incentive for pension funds to be run for current rather than future benefits.
