jabriella	716315075859070976	2016-04-02T17:23:17	it's great that you feel interesting and complex and special, but stop co-opting the struggle of ppl who do not pass as normative.
jabriella	716313860421103616	2016-04-02T17:18:27	if you'll never be deprived civil or human rights bc of your "non normative" identity then you're not fucking oppressed.
jabriella	716313265555574785	2016-04-02T17:16:05	it's great to explore the scope of personal expression &amp; identity, but using it to stake out a claim of victimhood is just narcissism!

jabriella	715974953930199040	2016-04-01T18:51:45	montoyan right. I also try and keep in mind that if I lived in a red state I would prob be inclined to blindly jump to his defense also.
jabriella	715974597645058048	2016-04-01T18:50:20	helitzur frankly, he might just be too old at this point for new learning. but I'm glad his message is out there bc it is so critical.
jabriella	715974110803791872	2016-04-01T18:48:24	helitzur don't think he *doesn't* care about other things; I think he has a fairly intransigent idea of how said other things are remedied.
jabriella	715972158095273984	2016-04-01T18:40:39	helitzur Big mistake imo that Bernie relied on old guard types i.e. Devine. way better messengers out there (for a fraction of the $ too)
jabriella	715971509924339712	2016-04-01T18:38:04	montoyan definitely. this was kind of meant as a response to your earlier tweet to me re the impulse to protect him.
jabriella	715969482305454080	2016-04-01T18:30:01	georgepearkes his horrendous immigration &amp; deportation policies come to mind. Middle East interventions as well.
jabriella	715969216336302083	2016-04-01T18:28:57	but giving Obama a continual pass on very dangerous policy decisions doesn't remedy this problem in any way. it's almost paternalistic.
jabriella	715968505703710721	2016-04-01T18:26:08	so yes this visceral drive to protect our first AfAm president who has faced unprecedented opposition makes a lot of sense! I get it.
jabriella	715967558680186881	2016-04-01T18:22:22	Yes. the rise of tea party populism post 08 revealed something v alarming about the American psyche &amp; deceit of "post racial" US.

jabriella	715381214572650497	2016-03-31T03:32:27	pnuts_mama KK0618 right so when candidates talk about the MIDDLE CLASS are they talking abt the poor too?

jabriella	715376501097635841	2016-03-31T03:13:43	KK0618 but this "self referral" phenomena is so fascinating to me.

jabriella	715375949878046720	2016-03-31T03:11:32	KK0618 like when I hear ppl I grew up w talk folksy abt money, yet they are bankers and their dads CFOs, im like ayfkm?
jabriella	715375604917518336	2016-03-31T03:10:09	KK0618 yeah I 100% grew up UMC possibly upper by some standards yet I feel like some of my classmates would still say we grew up MC.

jabriella	715374180905193473	2016-03-31T03:04:30	kokkinos_ exactly. feel like almost everyone would self refer MC but what are the actual metrics this day and age

jabriella	708047113603715072	2016-03-10T21:49:21	keethers but those ties are disintegrating, younger Cuban Ams are ready to move on &amp; build ties w home country.
jabriella	708046865946771457	2016-03-10T21:48:22	keethers for many years the link btwn the Republican party &amp; Cuban Americans was most impt factor in continuing isolation of Cuba.
jabriella	708046595330191360	2016-03-10T21:47:17	keethers more of a mixed bag than other LatAm groups, but leans liberal and growing even more liberal w time.
jabriella	708045538764177409	2016-03-10T21:43:05	keethers negligible impact IMO. the old conservative anti Castro guard is dying out, younger Cuban Americans much more amenable to changes.

jabriella	708037479627145218	2016-03-10T21:11:04	EricHazard I also appreciated his answer about the embargo &amp; Cuba last night.
jabriella	708037121479733249	2016-03-10T21:09:39	EricHazard it's almost unilaterally ignored. Bernie has alluded to the current situation in Central America, but it's not nearly enough.
jabriella	708036888876204032	2016-03-10T21:08:43	hilarycakes I'll read this in a bit. I know she understands, and I want to have faith in her. But, it's hard for me.
jabriella	708036365020221441	2016-03-10T21:06:38	I can't get behind any candidate for president who won't acknowledge the U.S.' role in sowing the seeds of LatAm instability &amp; violence.
jabriella	708036033246584832	2016-03-10T21:05:19	and we have the nerve to denigrate and turn our noses up at undocumented migrants who make treacherous journeys to try and escape.
jabriella	708035849989070848	2016-03-10T21:04:35	we've pillaged Latin America. overthrown democratically elected govs, stolen resources, funded repressive militias, fueled the drug war.

jabriella	708031106122162176	2016-03-10T20:45:44	I care deeply about Latin America, the people, the health of their institutions. HRC has proven time &amp; again status quo comes first.
jabriella	708030780535148545	2016-03-10T20:44:27	so please stop talking down to me or telling me I'm looking for attention from boys when I say I'm supporting Bernie Sanders.
jabriella	708030681302093829	2016-03-10T20:44:03	I would love to be proven wrong, trust me. But I don't see her exercising that kind of bravery.
jabriella	708030495821570048	2016-03-10T20:43:19	I have no reason to believe at this point that HRC will do anything to address root causes of migration, corruption, violence in LatAm.
jabriella	708030008619638784	2016-03-10T20:41:23	Hillary Clinton genuinely scared me last night. Continued pandering to the "gusano" class is indicative of an opportunism I find disgraceful
jabriella	708029515575005184	2016-03-10T20:39:25	so, call me a cynic, but I can't rally around politicians who pay lip service to Human Rights in LatAm/Cuba &amp; do not speak of the hypocrisy.
jabriella	708028484275322880	2016-03-10T20:35:19	not even delving into the incentive for &amp; impact of the embargo, which has DEVASTATED Cuba.
jabriella	708027939284250624	2016-03-10T20:33:09	so, it sounds sensible to say we really care about human rights in Cuba. but in reality that's been a pretty transparent smoke screen.
jabriella	708027303067033600	2016-03-10T20:30:38	the U.S. government called us "golden immigrants!"
jabriella	708027240198639621	2016-03-10T20:30:23	because, what they had suffered under Castro was worth more politically than what Haitians suffered under the Duvaliers.
jabriella	708026831576891393	2016-03-10T20:28:45	my family left Cuba in '61 and was granted citizenship in the '70's. granted, their lives were not easy here, but they were allowed to stay.
jabriella	708026500042375170	2016-03-10T20:27:26	all Cuban migrants needed to do was reach U.S. soil, and they were safe.
jabriella	708026308589187073	2016-03-10T20:26:41	but ACCESS TO CITIZENSHIP is arguably the most consequential factor in determining whether a group of immigrants will prosper in the U.S.
jabriella	708025455350251520	2016-03-10T20:23:17	so, yes. the story of the Cuban Diaspora is one of hard work, talent and sacrifice. there is no doubt. my own family is proof of that.
jabriella	708024773272584194	2016-03-10T20:20:35	but, we couldn't afford Haitians any legs up, because their home government was on our side, and doing so would've belied CW policy.
jabriella	708024256878272513	2016-03-10T20:18:31	((and I'm sure skin color had noooooothing to do with these seemingly arbitrarily afforded advantages. nothing. but I digress))
jabriella	708023945602146304	2016-03-10T20:17:17	but nonetheless glaringly disadvantaged compared to their Cuban counterparts who were very quickly able to climb political &amp; economic ranks.
jabriella	708022444511068161	2016-03-10T20:11:19	Haitians in the U.S. were funneled into deeply isolated &amp; impoverished neighborhoods, by &amp; large better than what they had under Duvalier.
jabriella	708020869680013312	2016-03-10T20:05:04	so long as they were on the right side of the Cold War, it didn't matter how many Haitians the tontons slaughtered. we turned a blind eye.
jabriella	708020108761894912	2016-03-10T20:02:02	because the Duvaliers were staunchly anti-communist.
jabriella	708020065682202624	2016-03-10T20:01:52	naturally, thousands of Haitians fled to the U.S...were they showered with praise &amp; protection from our government? of course not.
jabriella	708019763000299520	2016-03-10T20:00:40	the Duvaliers had their own private paramilitary force, tortured &amp; killed thousands, lived lavish lifestyle. SYSTEMIC HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES.
jabriella	708018950265769989	2016-03-10T19:57:26	During the Cold War Haiti was governed by the HIGHLY repressive Duvalier regime.
jabriella	708018326019186689	2016-03-10T19:54:57	it was a mutually beneficial partnership, both the Diaspora and government got what it wanted from the other. now, shift gears to Haiti...
jabriella	708017433588719616	2016-03-10T19:51:25	Cuban Americans have been forging remarkable political influence under the aegis of conservative leaders for decades.
jabriella	708017012874862592	2016-03-10T19:49:44	it's not a coincidence the two Latin American candidates running for POTUS are of Cuban descent and Republicans.
jabriella	708016019583803393	2016-03-10T19:45:48	CAMF rivals AIPAC in terms of its disproportionate power in shaping US policy toward a foreign conflict.
jabriella	708015713118773248	2016-03-10T19:44:34	Angry &amp; bellicose Cuban Americans in turn, w help from Reagan, were able to create a massive &amp; influential anti Castro lobby called CAMF.
jabriella	708015275917107201	2016-03-10T19:42:50	we did this to try and humiliate Castro, to say your people are leaving you and are thriving under capitalism.

jabriella	708013731503071232	2016-03-10T19:36:42	during the Cold War we used immigration policy to "embarrass" countries we considered a threat ie countries with leftist governments.
jabriella	708012772831924228	2016-03-10T19:32:53	one way this played out practically is in the disparate immigration policies we imposed on various LatAm nations after Castro's revolution.
jabriella	708007111192612864	2016-03-10T19:10:24	but it's disingenuous to claim our orientation toward the island for the last 50 years has been abt human rights rather than Cold War policy

jabriella	702570948290023426	2016-02-24T19:09:01	dmarknewman curious as to whether establishment types will really sit out/opt for HRC...
jabriella	702570481736482817	2016-02-24T19:07:10	Odd_Hack for sure. I think dem alarmists are severely overestimating how many Sanders supporters will sit out/choose Trump. they won't.
jabriella	702569706327285761	2016-02-24T19:04:05	PartyCatOlivia ICUDrEd this is what I'm curious about; pivoting once he gets the nom. can he win back those he alienated w primary strat?

jabriella	702568085824339968	2016-02-24T18:57:39	PartyCatOlivia I just don't see his path to a win. he'll get mods &amp; indies but establishment types will bolt &amp; true cons may stay home.

jabriella	687726542366085121	2016-01-14T20:02:39	"Beasts of No Nation" was just nominated for an Oscar. Here's why its portrayal of child soldiers is problematic: 
jabriella	687722918906826753	2016-01-14T19:48:15	don't let the people who scoffed at the term "White Hispanic" when George Zimmerman was arrested win. EXPLAIN WHY THIS IS TRUE + MATTERS.
jabriella	687722730234474496	2016-01-14T19:47:30	and by address, I mean a personal reckoning w your own identity + asserting that "Latino" is not a race. We cover the entire spectrum.
jabriella	687720368157626368	2016-01-14T19:38:07	I should say for the *White* Hispanic community. It is our responsibility to address the legacy of colorism/colonialsm in our homelands.
jabriella	687719337168363523	2016-01-14T19:34:01	it's very important for the Hispanic community to take initiative in uncoupling ethnicity + race wrt the world's perception of us.

jabriella	687717376230572032	2016-01-14T19:26:14	for me, it's always been the awkward "Yes, I'm still Latin" tho I'm clearly porcelain skinned &amp; look like my French-born great grandmother.
jabriella	687715119560830976	2016-01-14T19:17:16	It would behoove my fellow White/White-passing Latinos to own up to the significance of colorism in our ancestral homelands and here in U.S.
