GregorMacdonald	715779659355582464	2016-04-01T05:55:43	aloysiusfekete Near term EV adoption drives emissions lower. But entire car complex, w/ continued scaling = huge ongoing call on materials.
GregorMacdonald	715779061973446656	2016-04-01T05:53:21	eleanor70001 Yup. If associated automobile infrastructure was already complete, not a problem. But yes more cars drives chronic infra.
GregorMacdonald	715771905798762498	2016-04-01T05:24:55	ml8_ml8 Yes, clear signal that totality of considerations now driving new consumer behavior. Culture has better understanding of “cost.” !
GregorMacdonald	715770539483205636	2016-04-01T05:19:29	ml8_ml8 Mea culpa!
GregorMacdonald	715769843472007168	2016-04-01T05:16:43	alexrubalcava Yup, I embrace this rollout and there’s little negative about replacing existing ICE with EV.
GregorMacdonald	715768969790164992	2016-04-01T05:13:15	alexrubalcava Cheers. imo there are best case scenarios where EV adoption drives demand for more grid renewables. Great near term results.
GregorMacdonald	715767636072726531	2016-04-01T05:07:57	quanttrader But scale up of wind and solar at some future crossover point then drives demand for storage. Not bad, per se.
GregorMacdonald	715767395302969344	2016-04-01T05:07:00	quanttrader In best case scenario, EVs replacing *existing* ICE and thus driving demand for more wind and solar on grid = emissions drop.
GregorMacdonald	715765726318104577	2016-04-01T05:00:22	rbanta Yup. Indeed, despite the headline VMT number, per capita data across this space in US flattish, and some declines.
GregorMacdonald	715764884466769920	2016-04-01T04:57:01	rbanta I agree with you. But technology has habit of making things cheaper. I must be alert to being wrong: future car growth: upside risk.
GregorMacdonald	715764552823140354	2016-04-01T04:55:42	cohan_ds I welcome it. Hope it happens.
GregorMacdonald	715764376679149568	2016-04-01T04:55:00	11/ To sum up: EVs are huge improvement over ICE. Musk is a treasure, we are lucky to have him. But EVs don’t scale to emissions problem.
GregorMacdonald	715764037468962816	2016-04-01T04:53:39	rbanta It’s just not a thermodynamic advance, nor does it pressage reduced call on natural resources.
GregorMacdonald	715763652574445568	2016-04-01T04:52:07	10/ Solar’s great retort to FF: once solar is constructed, sun capture runs for 20-30 yrs. EVs = regress to chronic materials extraction.
GregorMacdonald	715762690657021952	2016-04-01T04:48:18	9/What are the emissions implications of turning over entire global fleet to EV, and increasing total fleet size, with EV? Materials yes?
GregorMacdonald	715762263274229760	2016-04-01T04:46:36	gnoll110 Oh right, I’m not threading correctly by using response function, right?
GregorMacdonald	715762105685786625	2016-04-01T04:45:58	8/My only caution about EV as the long-term solution is this -what I phrase as “The Project to Solve the Problem of Cars…Using Cars.”
GregorMacdonald	715761640558428160	2016-04-01T04:44:07	7/If so, then EV deployment between 2016-2020 are going to change minds. “Wow, OK, this is a real thing that’s starting to happen.”
GregorMacdonald	715761200198524928	2016-04-01T04:42:22	6/ EV are where global solar was in 2010: they’re about to start crossing past 1.00% market share of fleets in increasing # of domains.
GregorMacdonald	715760186242285570	2016-04-01T04:38:21	5/ But when you look at global city sales of EV, the picture looks much brighter. Was on the phone to Oslo, Norway today: EV going strong.
GregorMacdonald	715759650877095936	2016-04-01T04:36:13	4/ Now, for 5 years EV have missed opportunity to take market share. In the US, the return of auto sales did not trigger notable EV advance.
GregorMacdonald	715758743380692992	2016-04-01T04:32:37	3/ It’s crucial that innovators born here, and not born here, must automatically think: the US is where I can paint my masterpiece.
GregorMacdonald	715758294925721601	2016-04-01T04:30:50	2/ First, if the US has a longstanding edge it’s to create an inviting workshop for everyone, including immigrants like elonmusk to create.

GregorMacdonald	714818184377806850	2016-03-29T14:15:10	peters_glen Coda to our exchange: have written about coal for years. My recent general take: 
GregorMacdonald	714817234032394240	2016-03-29T14:11:23	bradplumer There’s less to say, now, but I did write up something on my now infrequent blog: 
GregorMacdonald	714816927374258176	2016-03-29T14:10:10	bradplumer Yes. Big adjustment here to have written about coal growth for years—to now accept the, halt and role of renewables at margin.
GregorMacdonald	714813511839252482	2016-03-29T13:56:36	bradplumer Having watched coal for 15 years, fascinating to me: its colossal advance was doubted, now its sudden stop is doubted.

GregorMacdonald	714548818033770496	2016-03-28T20:24:48	peters_glen A final question for you: do you have opinions about the quantity of future FF energy consumption that underlies RCP 8.5?
GregorMacdonald	714547756107325441	2016-03-28T20:20:35	peters_glen Looking ahead, the new great game hasn’t moved on to actual coal or FF declines, just yet. Game is to meet marginal growth.
GregorMacdonald	714547454176141313	2016-03-28T20:19:23	peters_glen As for China, Beijing is verifiably freaked out and has been for some time about air pollution. That is a big driver for them.
GregorMacdonald	714547316892368896	2016-03-28T20:18:50	peters_glen My concern 3-4 years ago was slower econ growth would impact renewable roll out. New view: low interest rates more powerful.
GregorMacdonald	714545112651436032	2016-03-28T20:10:05	peters_glen Indeed. I am well familiar with these flows. And I have opinions about them. Such as: inevitable turn to slower econ growth.
GregorMacdonald	714544725093552128	2016-03-28T20:08:32	peters_glen No better domain to observe this than China. However, scale of Wind+Solar now much more impactful to whole market to 2020. 2/2
GregorMacdonald	714544443475369985	2016-03-28T20:07:25	peters_glen The equation is changing. You are absolutely correct: slow economic growth makes gap for renewables to exploit. 1/2

GregorMacdonald	706564166396411905	2016-03-06T19:36:39	bobsagetfanatic Would also mention, my focus now has shifted to the 1237 problem, and less on who gets there.
GregorMacdonald	706563597212606464	2016-03-06T19:34:23	bobsagetfanatic I am open to idea that delegate harvesting tilts back again to Trump. Just saying: it must do so hard, and fast.
GregorMacdonald	706558497475833856	2016-03-06T19:14:07	Many congrats to my buddy Jeremy who has signed with Sub-Pop, playing guitar for Kyle Craft: 
GregorMacdonald	706549460889808896	2016-03-06T18:38:13	adamcarstens Yes, my line of inquiry here is almost entirely about 1237 receding further into horizon, out of reach.

GregorMacdonald	706547707045740544	2016-03-06T18:31:15	adamcarstens That’s most probable, yes. But one of the 2 will still need race to tilt hard, and tilt quickly. How likely is that?
GregorMacdonald	706546140909424640	2016-03-06T18:25:01	adamcarstens Ah, but it didn’t become a two man race soon *enough.* Kasich and Rubio dilutive effects run at least through 15 March, agree?
GregorMacdonald	706545290640109568	2016-03-06T18:21:38	adamcarstens TOTD: % of remaining delegates needed by each GOP-er to reach 1237 well exceeds % performance in all contests to date.

GregorMacdonald	706540836289273856	2016-03-06T18:03:56	sustainable2050 Kees, your publishing record on energy transition as an evolutionary phenomenon of is looking stronger than ever. samori8

GregorMacdonald	706538479891525632	2016-03-06T17:54:35	sustainable2050 Right, as I am saying mixing dependency arguments into rate ’n trend evolutionary paths can lead to confusion. samori8
GregorMacdonald	706537828901998592	2016-03-06T17:51:59	samori8 You are mixing a dependency argument into an evolutionary phenomenon, in which evidence for avoided oil growth is not tiny.
GregorMacdonald	706537098598182913	2016-03-06T17:49:05	samori8 Oil has a monopoly over oil-based transport. And always will. This is not dispositive of the decadal trends towards transit.
GregorMacdonald	706535955436433408	2016-03-06T17:44:33	samori8 The evidence is oil’s 15 straight year’s of market share loss, huge avoided growth in US from transit, and elsewhere, China too.
GregorMacdonald	706535731083087873	2016-03-06T17:43:39	samori8 The device or machine level perspective on oil dependency is only one part of the story of constraint, in transition. bradplumer
GregorMacdonald	706535271848738817	2016-03-06T17:41:50	samori8 Probably don’t want to assert “oil has no competition”, when avoided oil demand growth is a true phenomenon over past 15 years.
GregorMacdonald	706534239987052545	2016-03-06T17:37:44	samori8 I used to share the perspective. Now I don’t, or at least to significantly lesser degree. bradplumer
GregorMacdonald	706533710330351616	2016-03-06T17:35:37	samori8 Sam, the market cares as much about 1.3 billion people and oil dependency as it does global coal dependency at ATH. bradplumer
GregorMacdonald	706532184069279745	2016-03-06T17:29:34	bradplumer It appears China’s self-reported oil demand growth rate data is different than others. One could start there. samori8
GregorMacdonald	706531792363266048	2016-03-06T17:28:00	samori8  Absolute levels for absolute discussions. Rates for rate discussions. Which one are you having? bradplumer
GregorMacdonald	706529974698704896	2016-03-06T17:20:47	samori8 I knew you’d show up to talk about the absolute level. :-) bradplumer
GregorMacdonald	706528379869097984	2016-03-06T17:14:27	bradplumer Yes. On the other side of the argument: the self-reported 1.00% increase of all energy sources last year…it gives one pause. :-)
GregorMacdonald	706528019343495168	2016-03-06T17:13:01	bradplumer Normally I comment on China coal, but here, just have to recall all those who fought evidence China’s oil demand was falling too
GregorMacdonald	706524783245004800	2016-03-06T17:00:09	Percent of remaining delegates needed to reach 1237 in GOP. Trump: 53% | Cruz 58% | Rubio 69% | Kasich 75%.

GregorMacdonald	706348846872330240	2016-03-06T05:21:03	My impression: election prediction markets have a wishful thinking bias. Bush, Rubio, contested conv all reflect it. 
GregorMacdonald	706343970389958656	2016-03-06T05:01:40	adamcarstens I want some Carstens Premium on the march to the 1237 hurdle; and Kasich+Rubio as ongoing, diluting factors. thestalwart
GregorMacdonald	706343399553527808	2016-03-06T04:59:24	laseptiemewilay My point also. A call option on no one reaching 1237 may be selling too cheaply. That’s buyable.
GregorMacdonald	706342482536112128	2016-03-06T04:55:45	thestalwart That said. Trump finally got hit hard (a requisite moment) and Cruz performed a miracle (a testament to true strength).
GregorMacdonald	706341726911213570	2016-03-06T04:52:45	adamcarstens Wolfers saying 39% probability of not reaching 1237 too high. I say too low. imo, that risk skyrocketed today. thestalwart
GregorMacdonald	706341153403056128	2016-03-06T04:50:28	adamcarstens LA is indeed a clean result. But only for today’s set of contests. Can’t extrap to MI, IL, OH, FL. thestalwart
GregorMacdonald	706337497291165697	2016-03-06T04:35:57	justinwolfers Given percentage of remaining delegates required by Trump and Cruz, and current field, markets may be underestimating risk.

GregorMacdonald	706326920346996736	2016-03-06T03:53:55	For the GOP, the number 1237 flickers, goes faint on the horizon.
GregorMacdonald	706171301837217794	2016-03-05T17:35:33	mateosfo There’s an original talking point that I’m responding to, that appears to have been lost in the thread: the liquidity trap.
GregorMacdonald	706170870297800705	2016-03-05T17:33:50	eean My original point is about a broader topic, which is deflationary pressures across whole of OECD. Trump would worsen that condition.
GregorMacdonald	706170579368292353	2016-03-05T17:32:40	eean Interesting, but a narrow point on a different line of inquiry. With global trade already recession, Trump won’t solve liquidity trap.
GregorMacdonald	706168414545383426	2016-03-05T17:24:04	400 years ago today the Church denounced Copernicus, banned books by Galileo &amp; de Zuniga.  
GregorMacdonald	706136597977128961	2016-03-05T15:17:38	_ravensfan61 That’s right. There’s a whole class of infra-build and environmental tasks that likely have positive ROI. We could just do it.
GregorMacdonald	706135694108823552	2016-03-05T15:14:03	traderscrucible Right but I’m making a broader point here about the silly hunch that Trump would be expansionary.
GregorMacdonald	706135018603569156	2016-03-05T15:11:22	Trump’s not floating ideas like rebuilding the national railroad system. No, he’s threatening to kill trade further (already in recession).
GregorMacdonald	706130322513989632	2016-03-05T14:52:42	So, the cost-free intellectual lark this week was imagining that a Trump Presidency would somehow end the liquidity trap here in the OECD.

GregorMacdonald	706125473734995968	2016-03-05T14:33:26	wmalhittle Thanks, my simpler take is: add the variables to current trends, and price will start discounting 2017 realities by late Q3.
GregorMacdonald	706124421975527424	2016-03-05T14:29:16	wmalhittle Yes, that’s right where I am too on the supply side. But woodmac must be seeing a demand recovery also, in Q4, yes?
GregorMacdonald	706123730586501121	2016-03-05T14:26:31	Maybe this matters to price, by Q4. But global annual avg production in 2016 still not poised to fall vs 2015.

GregorMacdonald	705125326741876736	2016-03-02T20:19:13	M_C_Klein Right, and this is nothing more than snarky wishcasting, given Trump has been super clear about flexing trade muscle/tarrifs.

GregorMacdonald	680118040923521025	2015-12-24T20:09:11	mzjacobson Thanks! …for the conversation, and especially your work which I have read very carefully. All best for the holidays.
GregorMacdonald	680117649204879360	2015-12-24T20:07:38	mzjacobson Indeed, but surely you agree that first 50% will distribute through the grid, and second 50% will face harder problem: transport
GregorMacdonald	680117353699356672	2015-12-24T20:06:27	mzjacobson 2/ I observe policy and conventional capitalism already guiding to First marker. But Second marker will require very new policy.
GregorMacdonald	680116913456824320	2015-12-24T20:04:42	mzjacobson 1/ A time map -First marker: WWS takes 100% of marginal energy growth. Second marker: WWS eats away at existing capacity.
GregorMacdonald	680115609875554304	2015-12-24T19:59:31	arthurhcyip Right. My grid decarb rates and projections are already pretty optimistic. Marshall Plan policy boost would help. Time = bitch.
GregorMacdonald	680114997813325825	2015-12-24T19:57:06	mzjacobson 2/…even an immediate global adoption of WWS is really a 20+ year infrastructure project. Not an argument against it. But, time.
GregorMacdonald	680114684477837314	2015-12-24T19:55:51	mzjacobson 1/ Well, that may happen anyway right? There's Smith&amp;Stephenson (UCLA) modeling on summer arctic—already grim. Meanwhile…
GregorMacdonald	680109827272491009	2015-12-24T19:36:33	mzjacobson As I take Modi+Goyal seriously, have to conjecture if new nukes come online in 2026 - greatly helpful to India's W+S big bang.
GregorMacdonald	680108705010958336	2015-12-24T19:32:05	mzjacobson Yes, the latest accountings from Lazard very persuasive. OECD wind deployment rates, efficiency, ROI impressive, amazing even.
GregorMacdonald	680106875208114177	2015-12-24T19:24:49	mzjacobson However, in India, Asia ex-China, nukes along w/ wind+solar could hit the 2020-2030 window harder. Climate: earlier=better, yes?
GregorMacdonald	680106208280199174	2015-12-24T19:22:10	mzjacobson Yes, clearly solar now dominates Zero to One dynamic, especially for next 1B people to come onto grid. dropeik
GregorMacdonald	680105123142488065	2015-12-24T19:17:51	dropeik More broadly, would encourage reframe from WWS vs Nuke to powergrid decarb rate vs transport decarb rate as more crucial problem..
GregorMacdonald	680104278103465985	2015-12-24T19:14:30	mzjacobson Importantly, regardless of WWS + Nuke rates, powergrid decarb already has nice visibility. Transportation harder. dropeik
GregorMacdonald	680103862313721860	2015-12-24T19:12:51	mzjacobson Agreed, but w/some uncertainties. Solar already fast. OECD nuke deployment slow. But Non-OECD nuke rate faster.  dropeik

GregorMacdonald	680092733906632704	2015-12-24T18:28:37	dropeik Presently, the question turns on the rate, yes? WWS scalable, clearly capable. But w/o nuclear: problem of the rate.  mzjacobson
