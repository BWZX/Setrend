csoghoian	714668857206706176	2016-03-29T04:21:48	AoDespair The news in this case is that the FBI is fighting efforts to disclose its browser exploit. That is a big deal, in tech circles.
csoghoian	714668644723257344	2016-03-29T04:20:57	AoDespair I focus on surveillance technology. What interests me is how the gov spies, not the kinds of cases in which they spy.

csoghoian	714654624628617216	2016-03-29T03:25:14	AoDespair So the issue is. You started following me a week ago, and I haven't tweeted about the CP aspect to this case during the past week
csoghoian	714654371577876484	2016-03-29T03:24:14	AoDespair This tweet even included a trigger warning. See: 
csoghoian	714653364823285762	2016-03-29T03:20:14	AoDespair Going forward, you should just assume that all the scary surveillance tech I tweet about involves either child porn or terrorism.

csoghoian	714650631005282304	2016-03-29T03:09:22	AoDespair So your main beef is that I chose to use all of the 140 chars to focus on the FBI keeping its browser exploit secret?

csoghoian	714650251013918720	2016-03-29T03:07:52	AoDespair DOJ uses new surveillance tools in the most sympathetic cases. They establish precedent, and then later, expand to other cases.

csoghoian	714647670606798848	2016-03-29T02:57:36	AoDespair I don't think there is any excuse for DOJ to lie to the courts.
csoghoian	714647552532946944	2016-03-29T02:57:08	AoDespair DOJ doesn't get a free pass to break the law, just because they are going after child pornographers.
csoghoian	714647339726544896	2016-03-29T02:56:17	AoDespair The 4th amendment, DOJ lying to the courts, and the cybersecurity equities are all serious, whether child porn or another crime.
csoghoian	714647033089396736	2016-03-29T02:55:04	AoDespair Respectfully, that the case involves child porn doesn't matter.
