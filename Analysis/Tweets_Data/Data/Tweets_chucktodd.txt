chucktodd	703755050401697792	2016-02-28T01:34:13	Miami UNC and UVA have all beaten each other this week.  ACC is a meat grinder, should make them all tougher for tourney.
chucktodd	703750710383517696	2016-02-28T01:16:59	What's better for Miami hoops: a UNC win or a UVA win tonight?  Just want Miami on the 2 line for the tourney

chucktodd	696153361620447232	2016-02-07T02:07:49	That was a tough first hour for Rubio. Christie was brutal against him. So far, that's the story.
chucktodd	696151547407966208	2016-02-07T02:00:37	Halfway in, who still wants to take the bet that Rubio will surge over Trump and win NH?
chucktodd	696150585473544193	2016-02-07T01:56:48	That was Christie's best anti-Rubio hit of the night. Tad more nuanced and yet just as tough. Re: immigration
chucktodd	696150448680599553	2016-02-07T01:56:15	This debate is a bit herky jerky.  Starts in on some interesting topics but then abruptly changes course.
chucktodd	696146073350373376	2016-02-07T01:38:52	Don't know if Christie was helped with Rubio take down, but clearly Rubio was hurt during that exchange.

chucktodd	694370471773483008	2016-02-02T04:03:15	Wouldn't be surprised if there was a flood of endorsements for Rubio in the next week.

chucktodd	694367984605790208	2016-02-02T03:53:22	Trump didn't say a negative thing about a single GOPer tonight.  Notable
chucktodd	694367844289478656	2016-02-02T03:52:49	Iowa was must win for Cruz. NH is now must win for Trump.
chucktodd	694366553735716864	2016-02-02T03:47:41	Trump plans to take the stage after Rubio finishes.  Big test for him.  How does he handle losing.
chucktodd	694366302815653888	2016-02-02T03:46:41	Still, that's a lot of money Team Bush spent for what could be just one delegate in Iowa.
chucktodd	694366198331342848	2016-02-02T03:46:17	Our initial delegate allocation estimates for GOP indicate that even Bush might get one delegate based on IA allocation system.
chucktodd	694363815681478656	2016-02-02T03:36:48	Rubio campaign very savvy to claim the first "victory" speech slot of the night
chucktodd	694362769852727301	2016-02-02T03:32:39	How a candidate handles a concession speech on a night like this will tell us about their staying power.
chucktodd	694362331745157120	2016-02-02T03:30:55	Clinton source gloating: Sanders got turnout he needed and yet they believe she won.  Too close for us to call just yet.
chucktodd	694360555318947840	2016-02-02T03:23:51	Official. NBC has called it for Cruz.
chucktodd	694359427093139456	2016-02-02T03:19:22	We have 97% of GOP vote in. Cruz up 28-24 over Trump. But Rubio is just 2200 votes behind Trump and is at 23%
chucktodd	694359153238642689	2016-02-02T03:18:17	Only drama left on GOP side is whether Rubio catches Trump for second.  Now that's a surprise.
chucktodd	694358602153345025	2016-02-02T03:16:05	Rubio is the new buzz, but 63% of GOP Iowans (right now) still voting for anti-establishment Cruz, Carson and Trump

chucktodd	694350375885807620	2016-02-02T02:43:24	On the Dem side, best news Clinton got was that Q poll showing Sanders ahead because if she wins then she survived. Win is a win
chucktodd	694350086432649216	2016-02-02T02:42:15	If this holds on GOP side, then Cruz shows he could take a punch. Rubio has the spark he needed and Trump now faces a must win in NH
chucktodd	694347080286887937	2016-02-02T02:30:18	My pollster pals will love this nugget: Cruz winning "very conservatives" Rubio winning "somewhat conservatives" Trump winning "moderates"

chucktodd	694326679074795520	2016-02-02T01:09:14	Sanders wants a more liberal electorate and Trump needs a less conservative electorate. Both getting what they need. So far
chucktodd	694326524594401280	2016-02-02T01:08:38	Dem electorate is more than 10 points more liberal than 2008. The GOP electorate is nearly 10 points less on the "very conservative" front

chucktodd	693250355036098561	2016-01-30T01:52:19	If Cruz is attacking Rubio, then he is ceding 1st place in Iowa to Trump. What a world.
chucktodd	693236868071075840	2016-01-30T00:58:43	Only two candidates are consistently getting attacked right now: Trump and Rubio.  Sanders "America" ad is on a loop
chucktodd	693236692191318016	2016-01-30T00:58:01	How do some of us spend Friday nights in Iowa? Watching the local news commercial breaks.  3-4 min TV ad montages tell story of campaign

chucktodd	692917733130944512	2016-01-29T03:50:36	Interesting that no other candidate on stage wanted to butt in and tangle with Cruz on ethanol issue. Cruz caught a break
chucktodd	692917144149979136	2016-01-29T03:48:15	Cruz trying to blur the lines on ethanol issue; will be interesting to see who on stage decides to hug Branstad and push back
chucktodd	692916471782100992	2016-01-29T03:45:35	Why aren't these questions asked of more than one person? Would've been good to hear Rubio, Jeb on the Clinton q.
chucktodd	692916125802307586	2016-01-29T03:44:12	But the more muddled this debate is, it ends up only helping one candidate... "the elephant not in the room."
chucktodd	692915883329622016	2016-01-29T03:43:14	Christie handled bridge Q very well, but the moderators haven't helped him engage with Rubio and Cruz as much as he needs to be right now
chucktodd	692915596837687296	2016-01-29T03:42:06	About 6 weeks ago, Rand Paul seemed to decide, time to go back to his Libertarian comfort zone. Found his voice again, but is there time?
chucktodd	692915218553401344	2016-01-29T03:40:36	Cruz took some incoming (less than I expected). Rubio had a strong start but immigration ties him in knots
chucktodd	692915096532680704	2016-01-29T03:40:07	This is a tough debate to declare a clear winner. Some candidates had great moments that won't play well w/GOP base, for instance, Jeb
chucktodd	692912455467560961	2016-01-29T03:29:37	Immigration may be THE decisive issue for many primary voters and yet tonight's debate muddled it for everyone, esp Cruz &amp; Rubio
chucktodd	692911311445950464	2016-01-29T03:25:04	There's a Google color coded state by state search map here in debate spin room.  And Trump is most searched in every state for this debate
chucktodd	692908405535723521	2016-01-29T03:13:32	Wow.  That was quite a montage Fox put together to ask Cruz that immigration question.   Will be curious if other candidates get montages
chucktodd	692901415270768640	2016-01-29T02:45:45	Disappointing that the Ferguson question was only directed to Paul. Too bad they didn't get a few others to weigh in
chucktodd	692899645085736960	2016-01-29T02:38:43	Meanwhile, Santorum is addressing Trump's crowd right now. What a surreal scene. What has this campaign come to?
chucktodd	692899270370852864	2016-01-29T02:37:14	Rubio continues to show the most comfort on stage when topic is national security.  He's been very strong for those looking for a hawk
chucktodd	692898593913466880	2016-01-29T02:34:32	"Hate action" -- For GOP primary voters, many will believe Rubio owned that domestic terrorism vs protected speech question.
chucktodd	692897580133412870	2016-01-29T02:30:31	Much tougher for Cruz to score points on media bashing when it is a Fox event.
chucktodd	692896655259996161	2016-01-29T02:26:50	With that last Christie hit, I believe there have now been more Hillary mentions than Trump mentions, just 26 mins into debate
chucktodd	692893378476789760	2016-01-29T02:13:49	The alternate universe where Trump didn't run is indeed less entertaining
chucktodd	692894288011612160	2016-01-29T02:17:26	Imagine if this Ben Carson had been this comfortable on stage when he was a frontrunner. He's truly improved at this format
chucktodd	692893308473864192	2016-01-29T02:13:32	Rubio's "i do respect Rand" comment seemed like a not so subtle shot at Cruz. Surprised he kept that so subtle
chucktodd	692893012838363145	2016-01-29T02:12:22	Well, who had Rand Paul in the "who will attack Ted Cruz first" pool?
chucktodd	692892653864652800	2016-01-29T02:10:56	It is two VERY different scenes at the Trump rally and the GOP debate.  There is a rock concert feel to the Trump event. Lower key at debate
chucktodd	692891232473731072	2016-01-29T02:05:17	Cruz gets the chance to be the "leader" of the anti-Trump brigade on stage; good moment for him, which was handed to him

chucktodd	688473456602644480	2016-01-16T21:30:37	Clinton is running into the problem sitting VPs usually have when running for third terms. Hard to passionately fight for continuity

chucktodd	687849928811524096	2016-01-15T04:12:57	That was some exchange between Rubio and Cruz.  Downright nasty.
chucktodd	687847141407064064	2016-01-15T04:01:52	Too many questions tonight were interview questions and not debate questions. These aren't indv interviews
chucktodd	687846796274577408	2016-01-15T04:00:30	Christie and Bush made good efforts to break up troika but it felt like the debate kept coming back to some combo of Trump Cruz and Rubio
chucktodd	687846578623803392	2016-01-15T03:59:38	This felt like a three person debate at times with Trump Cruz and Rubio coming across as most dominant. Also reflects standing of race
chucktodd	687839045754421249	2016-01-15T03:29:42	Rubio has seemed much more sharply partisan tonight than in past debates. He's already got "likable"—maybe he thinks he needs "tough"?

chucktodd	687823250089459712	2016-01-15T02:26:56	So far. Not a debate. Simply a series of interviews.  Missed early opportunity
chucktodd	687822428857319424	2016-01-15T02:23:40	"Paperwork error" is a legit defense but it makes it harder for him to hit others who may claim the same. When purity is lost, all bets off
