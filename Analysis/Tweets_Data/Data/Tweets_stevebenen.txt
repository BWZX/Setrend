stevebenen	726206815189475328	2016-04-30T00:29:31	charles_gaba A mere 14 months ago, there were zero states with AVR. Now it's four. Progress!

stevebenen	725841376764657665	2016-04-29T00:17:24	An important, uncontroversial ambassadorial nominee had to wait 11 months for a vote. The Senate is a silly place. 
stevebenen	725784128872927232	2016-04-28T20:29:55	14 months ago, not one US state had automatic voter registration. That's changed in a hurry

stevebenen	722880215253319680	2016-04-20T20:10:48	Sanders is no hypocrite on tax deductions. Better question: why right seems so confused about what hypocrisy means 
stevebenen	722777033105936384	2016-04-20T13:20:47	BellowUp That's both well said and a good catch. Thanks.
stevebenen	722769615676383232	2016-04-20T12:51:19	The rules allow Sanders to urge superdelegates to override voters' will. But is it wise?  
stevebenen	722450425966755840	2016-04-19T15:42:58	The allegation that the DNC &amp; Clinton campaign hatched an illegal fundraising scheme doesn't seem to hold up well 
stevebenen	722408029212250112	2016-04-19T12:54:30	GOP has promised an ACA alternative since *June 09*. The ongoing fiasco just keeps going  
stevebenen	722168455810650112	2016-04-18T21:02:31	Why does Donald Rumsfeld think the IRS writes the federal tax code?  
stevebenen	722044543164489728	2016-04-18T12:50:08	Do voters really care if Sanders stumbles on FP questions that fall outside his wheelhouse?  
stevebenen	721687066774540288	2016-04-17T13:09:39	Sanders makes his *42nd* Sunday-show appearance of 2016 today - easily #1 for the year so far. 42 tops anyone else in all of 2014 and 2015.
stevebenen	721400886065557504	2016-04-16T18:12:28	DrJHaulsee I'm so relieved there are photos. Just reading about it wouldn't have been nearly enough.

stevebenen	721045412870799360	2016-04-15T18:39:57	Fun to consider the possibility: GOP presidential nominee may not pick his own running mate

stevebenen	720662106270380033	2016-04-14T17:16:50	Forget the 2016 chatter - Paul Ryan is struggling in important ways in his *current* job  
stevebenen	720622704668372996	2016-04-14T14:40:15	bostonsboy87 But as I explained in the piece, that's not quite compelling. If you have a few minutes, click the link.
stevebenen	720620977516908544	2016-04-14T14:33:24	Sanders says Southern primaries "distort reality." I hope he'll explain what that means  
stevebenen	720593969743282176	2016-04-14T12:46:05	Responding to GOP passivity towards the Zika virus, the White House has stopped being polite &amp; started getting real 
stevebenen	720354451177877504	2016-04-13T20:54:19	I'm a little surprised the RNC's sleazy new fundraising scheme isn't a bigger story (yet)

stevebenen	719859071634010112	2016-04-12T12:05:51	Which is the bigger mystery: why Carson is on Team Trump or why Team Trump asks Carson to go on TV as a surrogate? 
stevebenen	719560158666473473	2016-04-11T16:18:05	Sanders is right that much of Clinton's current lead "came from the South," but that's only part of a broader story 
stevebenen	719528641055436800	2016-04-11T14:12:50	Increasingly, Trump uses "corrupt nonsense" and "the complex mechanics of the nominating process" interchangeably

stevebenen	717814539585265664	2016-04-06T20:41:37	DrJenGunter Fair enough! But when evaluating candidates based on who appeals to a broad mainstream, Cruz's agenda is ... problematic.
stevebenen	717813551851769856	2016-04-06T20:37:41	Just one of the many, many reasons Dems just don't seem to fear this guy's general-election appeal 
stevebenen	717799341470121984	2016-04-06T19:41:13	By any sensible metric, no one else would come close. (I'm fairly certain Cruz wouldn't disagree with the thesis.)

stevebenen	684363219125682180	2016-01-05T13:18:00	prchovanec Perhaps! But that's not quite what the White House's critics are arguing.
stevebenen	684361830337150977	2016-01-05T13:12:29	Right sees Obama's new gun policy as irrelevant. And dangerous. Both points can't be true

stevebenen	682198071258689537	2015-12-30T13:54:29	Five of the six most experienced GOP presidential candidates have already quit the race  
stevebenen	681894270836555776	2015-12-29T17:47:17	Maybe voters care more than pundits about Rubio's reluctance to show up for work?  
stevebenen	681843131688599552	2015-12-29T14:24:05	The latest Krugman chart on Obama's jobs record is a gem, but we can take it even further  
stevebenen	681637306705510400	2015-12-29T00:46:12	daveweigel This is a little obscure, but I assume you've seen this all-time great Lemmy movie reference? 
stevebenen	681491934318342144	2015-12-28T15:08:33	Rubio targeting Cruz makes sense. Rubio emphasizing "consistency" on immigration doesn't.  
stevebenen	681450001436962818	2015-12-28T12:21:55	Started reading the new EJDionne book over the holiday weekend. It's excellent, well worth your time 
stevebenen	679827177618145285	2015-12-24T00:53:24	daveweigel True, and that's a good thing. My own uncomfortable stroll down memory lane will run next week.
stevebenen	679826270050324480	2015-12-24T00:49:47	daveweigel I recall your 1st Pundit Accountability piece:  It's a shame that didn't catch on system-wide, isn't it?
stevebenen	679772602261319680	2015-12-23T21:16:32	The principal flaw in Rubio's "I've actually done something" pitch: it's ridiculously untrue  
stevebenen	679658958852886528	2015-12-23T13:44:57	As Trump dominates, several post-debate polls show same trend: Cruz gaining, Rubio slipping

stevebenen	679339132657778688	2015-12-22T16:34:05	Helewski Nice catch, Adam. Thanks for flagging.
stevebenen	679011110956179458	2015-12-21T18:50:38	Obama sees GOP as global "outlier" on climate. True, but this applies to other issues, too  
stevebenen	679007754560937985	2015-12-21T18:37:18	@1BillBudd Yep
stevebenen	678933442642464768	2015-12-21T13:42:01	beth4158 Perhaps, though with an unusually large GOP field, it's that much more difficult for any candidate to build such a large lead.
stevebenen	678928101628317696	2015-12-21T13:20:47	The last Republican WH candidate who led by 20+ points in late Dec and lost the nomination?  It's never happened.

stevebenen	676425932417196033	2015-12-14T15:38:04	Rubio is testing a dubious proposition: maybe "GOTV" stands for "Go On TV"?  
stevebenen	676388529291853824	2015-12-14T13:09:26	A year ago, pundits said Obama's presidency was over &amp; 2015 would be a bust. Oops
