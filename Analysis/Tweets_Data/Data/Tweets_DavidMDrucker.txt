DavidMDrucker	710927168147218432	2016-03-18T20:33:39	davidbnuttall No. Constitution governs elections. Elections are run by the states. Const does not prohibit political parties or their rules
DavidMDrucker	710926779955978241	2016-03-18T20:32:07	davidbnuttall Right. But when they didn't like that rule anymore, they didn't ignore it, they changed the rules (amended the Const.)
DavidMDrucker	710925381004615681	2016-03-18T20:26:33	davidbnuttall The Constitution is designed so as not to prohibit things it does not discuss.
