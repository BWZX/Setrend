MacRoweNick	721840957747015681	2016-04-17T23:21:10	stephenfgordon I think he definitely needs to explain policy position better. BoC is not ELB-constrained, so fiscal multiplier should be 0.

MacRoweNick	711153240017080320	2016-03-19T11:31:59	MikePMoffatt Yep. Daft. My approx benchmark: set BI=current welfare, then 50%(?) fed+prov flat tax on income starting at $0.
MacRoweNick	711151372608131072	2016-03-19T11:24:34	MikePMoffatt If we think of BI as just fitting a line on existing tax&amp;transfer system it is both less radical &amp; by construction affordable

MacRoweNick	711145491661254657	2016-03-19T11:01:12	MikePMoffatt Though in small open economy with perf cap mob that only works for temporary fiscal. Main effect of fiscal is to appreciate C$
MacRoweNick	711144749210718208	2016-03-19T10:58:15	MikePMoffatt But TBH, you could re-state your argument, and say that loose fiscal is needed for macroprudential reasons to raise r*.
MacRoweNick	711144246309494784	2016-03-19T10:56:15	MikePMoffatt If BoC sets higher rate than needed for 2% now, that weakens AD, which means must set even lower rate in future. Like Sweden
MacRoweNick	711141185096646656	2016-03-19T10:44:05	MikePMoffatt I don't think BoC that daft. They saw that strategy backfire badly in Sweden.
MacRoweNick	711012965210853376	2016-03-19T02:14:35	MikePMoffatt It will be mostly net exports (and a little investment) that will be crowded out. Because the BoC will offset to keep infla=2%

MacRoweNick	710174333075849216	2016-03-16T18:42:10	MikePMoffatt Hmm. Then we really should all be paying attention. (The other case, though very different, is maybe Vancouver &amp; house prices)
MacRoweNick	710172318392254464	2016-03-16T18:34:09	MikePMoffatt I didn't know that. That's a warning signal that should not be ignored.

MacRoweNick	710127714628444160	2016-03-16T15:36:55	JWMason1 I think that's right. (Unless elasticity varies in opposite way.) Maybe too hard to implement except for teens, bc easy observ age

MacRoweNick	692710416745680896	2016-01-28T14:06:47	AndyHarless OK. Depends if we define "recession" as: fall in Y; or AD &lt; AS. If former definition you are right. I prefer latter definition.

MacRoweNick	692692966054432768	2016-01-28T12:57:27	Using fiscal space now means declining fiscal space in future. Using monetary "space" now does not mean declining monetary space in future.

MacRoweNick	688733710787719168	2016-01-17T14:44:47	ritwik_priya "The price level" is just a name. Nominalism. David Hume's insight.

MacRoweNick	688732818315280385	2016-01-17T14:41:14	SBarlow_ROB It shows that helicopter money is net wealth iff accompanied by an announced implied proportionately higher price level target.
MacRoweNick	688731933933727745	2016-01-17T14:37:43	ritwik_priya Yep, but what's the "mistake" in this context?
MacRoweNick	688731715209195520	2016-01-17T14:36:51	SBarlow_ROB So money is not a liability of CB in normal sense of "liability". It's like an IOU where I can change my mind about what I Owe.
MacRoweNick	688730089895383040	2016-01-17T14:30:24	MacRoweNick And would we say that Money is a creature of the Charity?

MacRoweNick	688729353480458240	2016-01-17T14:27:28	A central bank announcing a doubled price level target immediately halves the real value of its existing monetary "liabilities".

MacRoweNick	688274185735389184	2016-01-16T08:18:48	MacRoweNick CB money was a CB liability when it was convertible on demand into gold. It's now indirectly convertible into the CPI basket.
