kanyewest	716377473387077635	2016-04-02T21:31:13	and also my number one design rule of anything I do from shoes to music to homes is that Kim has to like it....
kanyewest	716377052346060801	2016-04-02T21:29:33	plus when you sit on the platform your calf is sort of half on half off

kanyewest	712431014509944834	2016-03-23T00:09:24	I used an exclamation just to be an asshole and also to make a point! LOL
kanyewest	712430936365862912	2016-03-23T00:09:06	And I used a period because contrary to popular belief I strongly dislike exclamation points!
kanyewest	712430696426565632	2016-03-23T00:08:09	On another note, I strongly dislike suit jackets. I used the word dislike because I hate the word hate.

kanyewest	698421911110352896	2016-02-13T08:22:14	fashion ain’t no joke for me… It’s a way of life… creative expression and industry…
kanyewest	698421874754072576	2016-02-13T08:22:05	so many people didn’t make it and gave everything they had for me to stand on their shoulders and break through fashion…

kanyewest	698147598729875457	2016-02-12T14:12:13	but you can see at Madison Square Garden that you can stop us
kanyewest	698147489057218560	2016-02-12T14:11:47	8th   They want to control us with money and perception and mute the culture
kanyewest	698147360568930304	2016-02-12T14:11:16	7th  I miss that feeling  so that’s what I want to help restore
kanyewest	698147292637954048	2016-02-12T14:11:00	That’s why music is so fucking watered down right now    I miss that DMX feeling
kanyewest	698147169182810112	2016-02-12T14:10:30	6th  Stop trying to demonize real artist     Stop trying to compromise art
kanyewest	698146943927787522	2016-02-12T14:09:37	I can’t be mad at Kanye because he made me famous!  FACTS
kanyewest	698146866098278400	2016-02-12T14:09:18	She was having dinner with one of our friends who’s name I will keep out of this and she told him

kanyewest	698146450581164032	2016-02-12T14:07:39	4th Bitch is an endearing term in hip hop  like the word Nigga
kanyewest	698146344242958336	2016-02-12T14:07:14	3rd thing    I called Taylor and had a hour long convo with her about the line and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings
kanyewest	698146205688320000	2016-02-12T14:06:41	2nd thing   I asked my wife  for her blessings and she was cool with it
kanyewest	698146073190252545	2016-02-12T14:06:09	First thing is I’m an artist and as an artist I will express how I feel with no censorship
kanyewest	698145869720371200	2016-02-12T14:05:20	I did not diss Taylor Swift and I’ve never dissed her…
