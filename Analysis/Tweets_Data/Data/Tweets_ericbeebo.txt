ericbeebo	708029861923844096	2016-03-10T20:40:48	Today in 1803 the Louisiana Territory transferred from France to USA. For $15mill, 4c/acre, USA doubled in size. History's greatest bargain
ericbeebo	708015635192791046	2016-03-10T19:44:16	RajaKorman thalesians Manu_CB seems EUR/STXE version short-circuited by lack of sustained STXE rise. Will dig out correl chart later
ericbeebo	708015093028667393	2016-03-10T19:42:07	RajaKorman thalesians Manu_CB I should break it down but even when I was there big inflows. Hedging of existing stocks really does it
ericbeebo	708014090841661440	2016-03-10T19:38:08	Jeb Bush or bust 
ericbeebo	707996486987022336	2016-03-10T18:28:11	RajaKorman thalesians Manu_CB esp on equity side. foreign net buying of Japan shares &gt;$200 bln in past decade. hedging on that stock big!

ericbeebo	707992475412140032	2016-03-10T18:12:14	RajaKorman Manu_CB for EUR and JPY definitely, EUR is relatively new member of that club and HEDJ is good proxy 
ericbeebo	707991516917211136	2016-03-10T18:08:26	For now sticking with call for 2 more 10 bp ECB rate cuts this year
