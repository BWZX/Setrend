anamariecox	720810886743650304	2016-04-15T03:08:02	A strong and substantive debate that probably didn't change voters' minds.
anamariecox	720809470415142912	2016-04-15T03:02:24	jbouie nobody can look down their nose at people like  a Democrat, we've always been good at it b/c we freq don't even know we're doing it

anamariecox	720809743439114240	2016-04-15T03:03:29	Pretty clear Obama won the debate.
anamariecox	720809467084820482	2016-04-15T03:02:23	Rachel Maddow is on CNN trying to UN-sell me a timeshare?
anamariecox	720808842066440192	2016-04-15T02:59:54	If I could summarize: Hillary: OBAMA! Bernie: YOUNG PEOPLE! So let‚Äôs just send Malia back 25 years in a time machine‚Ä¶
anamariecox	720807254602027008	2016-04-15T02:53:36	Okay maybe Hillary bragging about raw vote totals is the closest thing we‚Äôll get to dick measuring, actually.
anamariecox	720806628371652608	2016-04-15T02:51:06	Sanders argument on independents being necessary to win White House actually contradicts results of Obama's two wins
anamariecox	720806388537167872	2016-04-15T02:50:09	An hour ago on MSNBC, Ted Cruz said Hillary Clinton refuses to talk about abortion rights. Hillary just demanded more q's on abortion rights

anamariecox	720805903109214209	2016-04-15T02:48:13	I guess this is the closest we get to talking about genitals in Democratic debates. Sad!
anamariecox	720805370130669568	2016-04-15T02:46:06	Shorter Hillary: Im absolutely great with a centrist, pro-corporate SCOTUS nominee being picked over my moderated Dems.

anamariecox	720804129849876480	2016-04-15T02:41:11	This is like an NBA game where the teams just hack each other the first half---and then play in the second.
anamariecox	720803902057160704	2016-04-15T02:40:16	Oh god it‚Äôd been 5m or so with no mention of Obama I almost forgot who people like better than Hillary.

anamariecox	720803075863089152	2016-04-15T02:36:59	zachdcarter I wonder how the fact of a Trump or Cruz nomination will change that.
anamariecox	720802608399515650	2016-04-15T02:35:08	What we should do is nationalize the higher ed system. ::ducks::

anamariecox	720801726157168640	2016-04-15T02:31:38	American politics, 2016. 
anamariecox	720801500360933376	2016-04-15T02:30:44	anamariecox Bernie is an asshole for justice. We need assholes for justice but maybe not for President.
anamariecox	720801285088223237	2016-04-15T02:29:52	zachdcarter I assume that‚Äôs how MOST Bernie folks feel‚Ä¶ I operate under the theory that the ‚ÄúBernie or bust‚Äù guys are outliers.

anamariecox	720800538246258688	2016-04-15T02:26:54	I am going to vote for Hillary, and I‚Äôll do so no regrets and with pride. Will I be *excited* about it? Well‚Ä¶
anamariecox	720799630615642113	2016-04-15T02:23:18	Make no mistake I *like* Hillary, and Sanders can make me cringe, but‚Ä¶ no question which is the better retail candidate.
anamariecox	720795894216531968	2016-04-15T02:08:27	If only this debate were in Flushing. That do do line would have been even better.   PLEASE SAM, STOP YOURSELF
anamariecox	720798910818725888	2016-04-15T02:20:26	anamariecox Does anyone even like Obama a third as much as they liked him in 2008?
anamariecox	720798801192230912	2016-04-15T02:20:00	.anamariecox Yeah, but Bernie is like Jordan Catalano. Hillary, like Brian Krakow. 
anamariecox	720798743742689280	2016-04-15T02:19:46	YES THIS. 
anamariecox	720798418218651648	2016-04-15T02:18:29	think we call this the Joe Biden zone 
anamariecox	720798319459508228	2016-04-15T02:18:05	I wish I liked Bernie less. And I wish I liked Hillary more.
anamariecox	720797551138574336	2016-04-15T02:15:02	Theatrical stuff aside, CNN debate is an excellent distillation of the most important differences between the candidates
anamariecox	720797295176843264	2016-04-15T02:14:01	I think Trump‚Äôs only positive legacy is being able to use ‚ÄúSad!‚Äù as a complete sentence in almost any circumstance.
anamariecox	720796397453225985	2016-04-15T02:10:27	lemme think about this...

anamariecox	720796210613719040	2016-04-15T02:09:43	Lol do you guys remember the columns about all Democrats were gonna have to figure out how to run ‚Äúagainst‚Äù Obama this year?
anamariecox	720794036437655552	2016-04-15T02:01:04	Sanders has really boxed himself in by refusing to criticize Obama, a man who has a kill list, which is used to kill people. DemDebate
anamariecox	720794036580327424	2016-04-15T02:01:04	HRC: Obama. .... Obama. Did I mention OBAMA? Obama. BTW, Obama. Thank you, good night. Obama. DemDebate
anamariecox	720794269091364864	2016-04-15T02:02:00	And now I have to point out, again, that this is boring policy shit and not enough mocking of personal defects.
anamariecox	720794077390766080	2016-04-15T02:01:14	Hillary‚Äôs debate plan: Obama‚Äôs legacy under glass, with a big sign BREAK IN CASE OF EMERGENCY
anamariecox	720793758418112514	2016-04-15T01:59:58	johnson_carrie :(
anamariecox	720793119071928320	2016-04-15T01:57:25	elium2 glad to hear this.
anamariecox	720792769749385216	2016-04-15T01:56:02	To review, Hillary defended basic logic of crime bill, Bernie defended the uncontroversial additional elements (VAWA, assault weapon ban).
anamariecox	720791992674836480	2016-04-15T01:52:57	I worry the moment for progressive-conservative cooperation on criminal justice has passed, if their leading candidates are an indication.
anamariecox	720791298764988417	2016-04-15T01:50:11	Let‚Äôs get on this then! You first. 
anamariecox	720790440035811333	2016-04-15T01:46:47	She‚Äôs still basically defending the *logic* crime bill. Huh.
anamariecox	720790226780618752	2016-04-15T01:45:56	Basically the GOP debates are all red meat, this is a wild-caught cod with a side of kale.
anamariecox	720789654409060352	2016-04-15T01:43:39	petridishes Fan service for all the shippers I guess?
anamariecox	720789425102278657	2016-04-15T01:42:45	The audience is reacting like this is a WWE match; I guess they haven‚Äôt watched the GOP debates?
anamariecox	720789160047456257	2016-04-15T01:41:42	james_koffler ShaunKing But ‚Äúlargely very supportive‚Äù is a lie.
anamariecox	720788441357688832	2016-04-15T01:38:50	can this debate just be a giant loop of both candidates laughing dismissively during the other candidate's answers
anamariecox	720787749901623297	2016-04-15T01:36:05	TRUTH: She can't release transcripts without exposing how she cuddled with and/or cowered before monied elite 
anamariecox	720788626360135681	2016-04-15T01:39:34	Hillary is lying when she says Bernie has been a reliable supporter of the NRA. It's not true.  He has a D- voting record from the NRA.
anamariecox	720788555581231107	2016-04-15T01:39:17	anamariecox In the 2nd hour they're gonna fight Looney Toons style, just a ball of dust and stars in the middle of the stage
anamariecox	720787989501198336	2016-04-15T01:37:02	Hillary giggling while Bernie sang "excuuuuse me" was just brutally and brilliantly dismissive.
anamariecox	720787787767648256	2016-04-15T01:36:14	This seems so bloody and personal but neither of them has has talked about dicks or declared an intent for a military coup. BORING.

anamariecox	720786599131291648	2016-04-15T01:31:31	Now if Sanders promised to do something about Comcast customer service, he‚Äôd have my vote and of c it‚Äôd be as fanciful as free college.
anamariecox	720786259304652800	2016-04-15T01:30:10	If Goldman Sachs paid Clinton in Sanderses, she'd have to ask for more than one per speech.  
anamariecox	720785316194488321	2016-04-15T01:26:25	If this were GOP debate: ‚ÄúMaybe Bernie‚Äôs hands are too small to rifle through old tax returns."
anamariecox	720785298158825473	2016-04-15T01:26:21	Btw I love Jane Sanders so much.
anamariecox	720784997691461632	2016-04-15T01:25:09	This is true. 
anamariecox	720784907107041280	2016-04-15T01:24:48	But remember: unless one of them starts talking about dick size, this is still more dignified than the GOP debates.
anamariecox	720784519377199104	2016-04-15T01:23:15	But she still hasn‚Äôt explained why she won‚Äôt release the transcripts.
anamariecox	720784070548918272	2016-04-15T01:21:28	Sanders gonna use the clap emoji next.
anamariecox	720783809202008064	2016-04-15T01:20:26	Bernie not doing himself any favors by not directly citing how Clinton's Wall Street speaking cash is connected to her policies.
anamariecox	720783544050552832	2016-04-15T01:19:23	Bernie and us having to hear about Dodd-Frank: like in gym when the guy who screwed up DOESN‚ÄôT have to run wind sprints everyone else does.
anamariecox	720783143444152322	2016-04-15T01:17:47	Ugh if Bernie had done his homework on Dodd-Frank then we wouldn‚Äôt have to be hearing so much about it tonight.

anamariecox	720782096118120448	2016-04-15T01:13:37	Hillary is at her best when she is being attacked; but  sometimes she relishes a little much to my tastes.
anamariecox	720781210008457216	2016-04-15T01:10:06	Good thing Clinton is dressed like a doctor because this debate is already drawing blood.
