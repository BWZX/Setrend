real_peerreview	725766024960823297	2016-04-28T19:17:59	berlinbuggirl But what if the genes for poverty and IQ overlap?
real_peerreview	725765636106903552	2016-04-28T19:16:26	berlinbuggirl Because correlation = causation.
real_peerreview	725765112481628165	2016-04-28T19:14:21	berlinbuggirl Also, none of the studies have shown that poverty is the causal environmental agent in humans.
