jonronson	719540463649296384	2016-04-11T14:59:49	MissEllieMae If it's any consolation my next project is much more about systemic abuse than individual abuse. You'll prob prefer it.
jonronson	719540246321479680	2016-04-11T14:58:57	MissEllieMae I totally hear you and there's no doubt - as the book shows - women have it worse than men.
jonronson	719537915341193216	2016-04-11T14:49:42	MissEllieMae ...know what it's like to be an unfashionable bullying victim, rejected by everyone.
jonronson	719537712148180992	2016-04-11T14:48:53	MissEllieMae When it comes to shaming, I'm convinced my view is informed by being bullied at school. When you're bullied at school you...
jonronson	719537477783003136	2016-04-11T14:47:57	MissEllieMae Well obviously I've considered whether my non-ideological viewpoint is itself an ideological viewpoint.
jonronson	719534146834546688	2016-04-11T14:34:43	MissEllieMae PS - I am unashamedly humanist over ideological. I think that's different from apolitical
jonronson	719533811479027712	2016-04-11T14:33:23	MissEllieMae no worries
jonronson	719533713307131905	2016-04-11T14:33:00	MissEllieMae I was making that very point in the way that I make points
jonronson	719533657489281024	2016-04-11T14:32:46	MissEllieMae I agree, and that's the chapter's conclusion - the room full of men, the fact that he got a new job and she didn't.
jonronson	719533158803382272	2016-04-11T14:30:47	MissEllieMae true, but I still feel that people leapt to the worst possible conclusions about her within minutes of hearing her name
jonronson	719532899427610625	2016-04-11T14:29:46	MissEllieMae but in later chapters - like the donglegate chapter - I look at individual motivations
jonronson	719532075729174528	2016-04-11T14:26:29	LiamMurray ha!
jonronson	719531945542205442	2016-04-11T14:25:58	MissEllieMae peterjukes ...responsible for some systemic failing.
jonronson	719531899828486144	2016-04-11T14:25:47	MissEllieMae peterjukes My main point is just don't pull a private individual out of the crowd who did nothing much wrong and make them...

jonronson	695542086528069632	2016-02-05T09:38:50	The ayewrite festival show last night in Glasgow was great. Thanks if you came.

jonronson	693413882740785152	2016-01-30T12:42:07	sa_moed LouiseMensch And I know there's no rule book. People just have to listen to their consciences.
jonronson	693413767254839296	2016-01-30T12:41:39	sa_moed LouiseMensch The book makes clear that it's not against satire, mockery, journalism, etc. It's when it turns disproportionate.
jonronson	693412943095054336	2016-01-30T12:38:23	LouiseMensch But the revelation that he contemplated suicide doesn't give people the right to bully anyone.
jonronson	693409360790343680	2016-01-30T12:24:09	whoislukecusick dougalpollux ha. I think.
jonronson	693409190560317440	2016-01-30T12:23:28	And I'm not just talking about Tim Hunt. I think everyone should lay off everyone.  
jonronson	693408388882022402	2016-01-30T12:20:17	Politicizing Tim Hunt's story, any which way, misses the point of it, I think. It's cruel to go after humans to feed some ideology.

jonronson	693361082535124992	2016-01-30T09:12:18	Doing a different show each night wreaked havoc on my mental well being, but it was lots of fun too.

jonronson	691404433272475649	2016-01-24T23:37:17	lor117 Just me and andy anxiety
jonronson	691395231258910721	2016-01-24T23:00:43	citizensayers Most my anxiety involves things like not being able to get my family on the phone. Etc. In terms of work, it doesn't impact.
jonronson	691395086614151169	2016-01-24T23:00:08	citizensayers Saying that, I almost never go to parties or dinners. But I've convinced myself that thats because I don't like them!
jonronson	691393929137262592	2016-01-24T22:55:32	citizensayers But that wouldn't work for me, because anxiety never stops me from doing anything. I think I'm lucky in that.
jonronson	691390150862094337	2016-01-24T22:40:32	citizensayers that sounds terrifying
jonronson	691364264494403585	2016-01-24T20:57:40	No! Sorry.

jonronson	691363102517018624	2016-01-24T20:53:03	Newmanitarian NO!
jonronson	691362565167931393	2016-01-24T20:50:55	I'm writing down lots of areas where Louis and I have common ground. There's much to discuss.
jonronson	691362154168066054	2016-01-24T20:49:17	Newmanitarian YES. But I'm keeping it a surprise.
jonronson	691361812961443846	2016-01-24T20:47:55	jonronson not a "disorder" so much as an evolved advanced advantage sense, then?
jonronson	691361735224201217	2016-01-24T20:47:37	Hemmo VERY WISE
jonronson	691361676139073536	2016-01-24T20:47:23	Also, there are SURPRISE guests on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday nights. I am going to a LOT of trouble.
jonronson	691361262555545600	2016-01-24T20:45:44	Do you know who WON'T be on stage with Louis Theroux in Leicester Square on Tuesday? People who don't have anxiety disorders.
jonronson	691361118825115649	2016-01-24T20:45:10	Because I have an anxiety disorder so I changed my flight DAYS ago, before there wasn't any snow.
jonronson	691360958791471104	2016-01-24T20:44:32	So many cancelled flights to the UK. Do you know who isn't worried? Me. Why not? I'm already here. Why?
jonronson	691273419367845890	2016-01-24T14:56:41	IPetFudge Jesus! Calm down.

jonronson	691196256098635776	2016-01-24T09:50:03	There's a golden period, I think, between the ages of 17 - 50, approx, where waiters don't treat you condescendingly.
jonronson	691196046903492608	2016-01-24T09:49:14	I think I'm approaching the age where waiters start to treat me slightly condescendingly.

jonronson	691161815502491648	2016-01-24T07:33:12	Oh, ThisAmerLife has repeated the story about when my mother commissioned a brilliant but troubled local artist to paint a family portrait.
jonronson	690985273564516356	2016-01-23T19:51:41	One frozen margarita  
jonronson	690984132751540224	2016-01-23T19:47:09	robinince I'm not sure if two of them count
jonronson	690983937280204800	2016-01-23T19:46:23	It's the funniest thing. I was googling Jon Stewart and Mark Ronson. 
jonronson	690983765984874497	2016-01-23T19:45:42	Someone wrote how I "made" my "career" writing about Justine Sacco. 30 years! Nine books! Approx nine books!
jonronson	690983585822724096	2016-01-23T19:44:59	Well that's the last time I accidentally type my name into google.
jonronson	690983451131056133	2016-01-23T19:44:27	JoelTscherne someone else mentioned it. Did Bill Maher look blankly at him in response?
jonronson	690981316003766272	2016-01-23T19:35:58	And Trump will shoot you if you tread on the middle of 5th Avenue.  
jonronson	690979982026371072	2016-01-23T19:30:40	Now I'll have to give my advance back. And dismantle my sett.
jonronson	690979776564170752	2016-01-23T19:29:51	Fuck. I was going to live like a badger.

jonronson	690898554496405505	2016-01-23T14:07:06	Seeing these swathes of Soho reduced to rubble - half close your eyes and it's like The Blitz.
jonronson	690898005512339456	2016-01-23T14:04:55	This really sucks. 
jonronson	690889085196636160	2016-01-23T13:29:28	It's totally outrageous this crossrail thing. I know cities are supposed to change but this is like Warsaw. 
jonronson	690856084790181888	2016-01-23T11:18:20	sareypoppins yes! Will you email when you get here?
jonronson	690851419956580352	2016-01-23T10:59:48	I was thinking exactly the same thing  
jonronson	690850698985086976	2016-01-23T10:56:56	This crossrail site at the top of dean street is a huge gross chiseling out of all my happy soho memories
jonronson	690846723036553216	2016-01-23T10:41:08	@feelmymethod A bit too late for that
jonronson	690846529855320064	2016-01-23T10:40:22	welladriansays if you re-read you'll probably understand
jonronson	690845458403606529	2016-01-23T10:36:07	welladriansays Sorry?
jonronson	690833163225042944	2016-01-23T09:47:15	I think there's some influence  
jonronson	690832325026942976	2016-01-23T09:43:55	...specify that some major characters are people of color. Put it in the character descriptions. I'm doing that. It starts with the writer.
jonronson	690831955127091200	2016-01-23T09:42:27	Re the Oscars thing. I remember ages ago reading someone say that a way to fix the problem is for screenwriters to...

jonronson	690683486584332288	2016-01-22T23:52:30	I liked The Martian  a lot BTW. Even though it did that thing where in press conferences all the journalists put up their hands at once.
jonronson	690683025496129536	2016-01-22T23:50:40	thenicklloyd I'm enjoying watching The Affair!
jonronson	690682414734151680	2016-01-22T23:48:14	This audiobook should be automatically updating with the new chapter too! 
jonronson	690682302867841026	2016-01-22T23:47:47	Fucking awful to live through, good to write about. The best things to write about were awful to live through.
jonronson	690681864701513728	2016-01-22T23:46:03	...the noise after the book came out.
jonronson	690681647088402432	2016-01-22T23:45:11	Oh cool. If you have a Kindle version of Shamed the new chapter should be magically manifesting now. It documents... 
jonronson	690681404703772676	2016-01-22T23:44:13	CharStamper hah seamless is such a huge part of New York life I assumed it would be the same in Britain
jonronson	690681005913567233	2016-01-22T23:42:38	@JustComagic I guess, but it needs to up its ethical standards, but then again so does mainstream journalism.
jonronson	690680308883181568	2016-01-22T23:39:52	robdoylecouk haha
jonronson	690679092883144704	2016-01-22T23:35:02	YouAmuseMe Eek. You should definitely check the flights. There could be delays...

jonronson	690678777257578501	2016-01-22T23:33:47	jonronson ...then it flushed, and it was like I WAS The Martian, winning with science and determination in the sky.
jonronson	690678606369013760	2016-01-22T23:33:06	On the plane I watched The Martian, then I went to the toilet and it wouldn't flush so I had to press the button four or five times...
jonronson	690678312352530433	2016-01-22T23:31:56	Once again, anxiety wins
jonronson	690678160925573120	2016-01-22T23:31:20	All those non-anxious people with a run of shows starting in Leicester Square on Tuesday and DIDN'T change their flights are fucked.
jonronson	690677270453862403	2016-01-22T23:27:48	My anxiety disorder compelled me to change my flight to beat the storm and I'm here.

jonronson	690211390183837697	2016-01-21T16:36:33	Pathugh40 ...parts of the interview will be terrible! Which is why you need to trust an editor and/or director. Some parts are never meant
jonronson	690211235640516608	2016-01-21T16:35:56	Pathugh40 In a perfect world, yes! The only way to get good interviews out of people is to be unselfconscious, but that often means some...
jonronson	690209445243150341	2016-01-21T16:28:49	Pathugh40 Oh dear. I'm not going to watch because watching rushes is always embarrassing, and are never meant to be viewed by the public.

jonronson	689997958314606592	2016-01-21T02:28:27	My evenings are spent getting worked up about how Noah is unsuitable for Alison in The Affair.
jonronson	689964130313322496	2016-01-21T00:14:02	scariest thing about Making A Murderer is all the obvious confirmation bias. Good jonronson podcast about it

jonronson	689856016465424385	2016-01-20T17:04:25	Started jonronson's public shaming book. His account of Jonah Lehrer's apology reads like science fiction, a scene from The Parallax View
jonronson	689842909294772226	2016-01-20T16:12:20	chrissssmith charmada My position is exactly the same as Stewart Lee's. He holds that position and also thinks Twitter is becoming a Stasi
jonronson	689842628884631552	2016-01-20T16:11:14	chrissssmith charmada I love that Stewart Lee thing. I heard it go out live and think of it often.

jonronson	689825569828179968	2016-01-20T15:03:26	cshea4 mcmoynihan If you give a flying fuck about the truth perhaps you'd like to look at this: 
jonronson	689823444704366592	2016-01-20T14:55:00	roryisconfused I *think* it never happens
jonronson	689822476998696964	2016-01-20T14:51:09	because interviews are empathetic relationships and so psychopaths just ramble off and talk about whatever they want to, self-lovingly.
jonronson	689822222987464704	2016-01-20T14:50:08	I am NOT saying they're psychopaths - I obv have NO IDEA - but I remember the experts telling me that psychopaths make lousy interviewees...
jonronson	689821970725277699	2016-01-20T14:49:08	...suddenly they snap into coherence and become horribly good.
jonronson	689821849631485952	2016-01-20T14:48:39	So interesting watching them. They're rambling and incoherent and you're thinking "They're rubbish at this" but... 
jonronson	689814361876123648	2016-01-20T14:18:54	jj_bull I wish I could tell you, but I don't know anything. Worth checking with the venue
jonronson	689814273992867840	2016-01-20T14:18:33	There's this book Cults: A Practical Guide that lists 'brainwashing techniques'. I love to spot them in *our* world. 
jonronson	689813964906172416	2016-01-20T14:17:20	Well, more normal than a Branch Davidian church. 
jonronson	689812506836082688	2016-01-20T14:11:32	Which, BTW, is why the whole shaming thing pissed me off. Nice people like us using the same dehumanizing techniques from despotic eras.
jonronson	689812029952167936	2016-01-20T14:09:38	jonronson A casino marketer told me they train tea ladies to remember names &amp; milk pref. It makes lonely ppl feel cared for, so they stay.
jonronson	689810250678038528	2016-01-20T14:02:34	Now those things are everywhere.
jonronson	689810109699067905	2016-01-20T14:02:00	I remember realizing that casinos adopted cult techniques - like having no clocks. And thinking, "Wow. Cult techniques in the normal world."
jonronson	689809474895364096	2016-01-20T13:59:29	More and more the normal world is seeming like a lunatic bygone age.

jonronson	689598600368779264	2016-01-20T00:01:33	Two terrible people on stage in Iowa saying "everyone says we're terrible but hahaha we're not terrible".

jonronson	689475054963298306	2016-01-19T15:50:37	Saddened that El Chapo means "shorty". It would be better if it meant "The chap."

jonronson	689193410616553473	2016-01-18T21:11:28	I think it was rights. We licensed a bunch of clips for uk broadcast only.

jonronson	689099586594541570	2016-01-18T14:58:38	PatrickStrud PS: You obviously tweeted me that without knowing the full context of the interview, which was itself a little insensitive.
jonronson	689099217357422592	2016-01-18T14:57:10	PatrickStrud I've just done a search and as it happens the topic is bought up here:

jonronson	688729127713665024	2016-01-17T14:26:34	jonronson After one aborted takeoff pilot announced a warning light had come on, but had now gone off so he was going to try again!
jonronson	688726108838211584	2016-01-17T14:14:34	jonronson Re: jauntiness. Crew announced: "We'll make two attempts and then divert. We got it on the second go earlier and it was GRAND".
jonronson	688725840402739201	2016-01-17T14:13:30	We had to get off and wait two hours and they found us a different plane 
jonronson	688725474181312512	2016-01-17T14:12:03	jonronson I've had something similar. On a plane, sat on a runway for an hour &amp; half. Pilot:"one of the engines is not quite tickety boo".
jonronson	688725605739794432	2016-01-17T14:12:34	CamillaElworthy last night - definitely!!!
jonronson	688725154701115392	2016-01-17T14:10:47	sineadgleeson yeah I've had that too!
jonronson	688724959145930752	2016-01-17T14:10:00	I thought the jauntiness was hilarious, given the circumstances. It was like, "FUCK. SOUND JAUNTY."
jonronson	688724844272308225	2016-01-17T14:09:33	"Well! We seem to have hit a little technical difficulty!" He said it in the jauntiest voice he could muster.
jonronson	688724507268395009	2016-01-17T14:08:13	Finally the plane stopped. There was about ten seconds of silence. Then the pilot came on the tannoy...
jonronson	688724211792236545	2016-01-17T14:07:02	It started screeching to a dramatic halt. Everyone on the plane was, "What the fuck?" People were gasping. Were we about to hit something?
jonronson	688723917528260608	2016-01-17T14:05:52	Yesterday I was on a plane. It was about to take off. It was speeding down the runway. Suddenly the pilot jammed on the brakes...
