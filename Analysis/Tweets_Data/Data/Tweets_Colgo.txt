Colgo	697386447309934592	2016-02-10T11:47:40	NewtonMark rustyoliver gotta jump. Great talking tax reform though!
Colgo	697385482699743232	2016-02-10T11:43:50	NewtonMark people on low incomes do pay plenty of tax. 19c in the dollar for everything over ~$18K a year. That's 20%!
Colgo	697384708238217216	2016-02-10T11:40:45	NewtonMark definitely a solid idea
Colgo	697384635987132416	2016-02-10T11:40:28	NewtonMark you could, although raising it on the rich is a narrow field. The vast majority of income tax is paid by middle income earners
Colgo	697384369208438784	2016-02-10T11:39:25	NewtonMark it's not a one-off - it's permanent reductions in income tax thresholds and marginal rates
Colgo	697384199209119744	2016-02-10T11:38:44	NewtonMark and, also, bracket creep and inflation would eat into the compensation anyway over time (though you could be "agile" on that!)
Colgo	697383904320163841	2016-02-10T11:37:34	NewtonMark if the compensation is designed to ensure only the wealthier pay, where do you define the cut-off point? etc.
Colgo	697383687625650176	2016-02-10T11:36:42	NewtonMark so, any proposal to implement it would involve compensation for lower-income households and workers, which is the idea BUT
Colgo	697383353926823936	2016-02-10T11:35:22	NewtonMark it's regressive by definition, yes
Colgo	697383105162661888	2016-02-10T11:34:23	NewtonMark rustyoliver ... all those things, but also politically impossible
Colgo	697380646436495360	2016-02-10T11:24:37	NewtonMark I agree with you on that. But the Baird proposal followed years of argument by economists - GST is efficient, low-volatility
Colgo	697380262464741376	2016-02-10T11:23:05	NewtonMark pretty sure it started with Mike Baird asking for it to pay for health and education.
