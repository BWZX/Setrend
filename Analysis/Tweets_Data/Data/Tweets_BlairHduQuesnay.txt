BlairHduQuesnay	712782035744468992	2016-03-23T23:24:14	So it never occurred to me that it would be weird to go visit my best friend in NYC for her birthday this weekend.

BlairHduQuesnay	712780658939076608	2016-03-23T23:18:46	I guess the Easter bunny brought baskets of candy when we were super little.
BlairHduQuesnay	712780527527337984	2016-03-23T23:18:15	So Easter was never a big holiday for me growing up .... went to church in colorful new dress but no family get together.

BlairHduQuesnay	712294498672332801	2016-03-22T15:06:56	BossyMargaret agreed. Mental illness is so sad, and we place no emphasis on treatment, except to prescribe everyone anti depressants.
