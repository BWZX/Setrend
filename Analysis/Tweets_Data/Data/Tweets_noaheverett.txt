noaheverett	721796487689199617	2016-04-17T20:24:27	TedTurnau haha! thanks ;)
noaheverett	721796401286529024	2016-04-17T20:24:07	box_art haha thaaanks, it's me doing the impersonation...you'd be surprised how often I pull out that voice
noaheverett	721796203302764545	2016-04-17T20:23:19	trapprain but that's no fun ;)
noaheverett	721796134042234881	2016-04-17T20:23:03	MANX38 haha that's a good one to do
noaheverett	721733445790130177	2016-04-17T16:13:57	Sarah hates when I do the Gollum voice 
noaheverett	720787111050362881	2016-04-15T01:33:33	kaweedo perfect score across the board, looks to be a IP reputation issue with Digitalocean
noaheverett	720409263617642496	2016-04-14T00:32:07	holmser very little still right now in our beta, 100'ish emails a week if that
noaheverett	720400965732425728	2016-04-13T23:59:09	holmser matthewdeaners ...actually disregard that, email was only to a few outside accounts during testing, probably didn't matter
noaheverett	720400465427468288	2016-04-13T23:57:10	holmser matthewdeaners Appreciate that info. Seems at first email was working fine (low usage &lt; 30/month), then started hitting spam
noaheverett	720386601663094784	2016-04-13T23:02:04	interactivered interesting...what kind of volume do you do with that SMTP server?
noaheverett	720385502797369346	2016-04-13T22:57:42	interactivered yeah...I think its @digialocean, from my research it seems their IP space is largely considered "spam" by email providers
noaheverett	720376919695306756	2016-04-13T22:23:36	noahhlo I assume its Digitalocean having bad IP rep since we have SPF, DKIM, DMARC, rDNS &amp; emails are well formed. New host is next try :)
noaheverett	720375015338676224	2016-04-13T22:16:02	noahhlo great post on email deliverability, does Basecamp still run its own email setup? Running into deliverability issues with my project
noaheverett	720373231543136256	2016-04-13T22:08:56	matthewdeaners very interesting...thanks for that info
noaheverett	720369833389334528	2016-04-13T21:55:26	matthewdeaners by default do providers mark "new" domains as SPAM until they get more data for rep? For now just mark as not spam to help?
noaheverett	720365209450258432	2016-04-13T21:37:04	alexlehm looking into that...thanks!

noaheverett	720318311645351936	2016-04-13T18:30:43	jasarmiento09 normally I'd agree, but it's across the board any recipient on gmail, yahoo or outlook from what I can tell...very strange
noaheverett	720317824527261700	2016-04-13T18:28:46	trapprain loudmouthman appreciate it!
noaheverett	720317749591810048	2016-04-13T18:28:29	michaelfromuk basically any emailfrom the domain is sent to spam on gmail, yahoo, outlook...no rejection type I can see

noaheverett	705106105295360000	2016-03-02T19:02:50	box_art didn't quite understand their shutdown either, but that's without seeing the numbers
noaheverett	705103432961626113	2016-03-02T18:52:13	Found this old photo of Twitpic servers in my parents van headed for the datacenter - 7 years ago! Time flies...

noaheverett	702557632893165569	2016-02-24T18:16:07	MladenPrajdic does Paypal file and pay the VAT to the specific country for you or do you have to do that manually yourself?

noaheverett	689928547260092417	2016-01-20T21:52:38	gsf___ haha ok cool...I contacted digitalocean's support about it too and they referred me to this tutorial 
noaheverett	689926329442123776	2016-01-20T21:43:49	gsf___ what distro / version are you running? this is is on digitalocean too?
noaheverett	689920407596634112	2016-01-20T21:20:17	You may need to manually change your kernel version in Digitalocean's control panel to fix CVE-2016-0728, dist-upgrade might not work
noaheverett	689508256113242112	2016-01-19T18:02:33	BellaBianca85 Pingly is a messaging app that works with Email and SMS...there's also a little more info on

noaheverett	687314539650674689	2016-01-13T16:45:30	Philoushka thanks for subscribing Phil!
noaheverett	687314401234391040	2016-01-13T16:44:57	vlucas are you writing each platform independently using Swift / Java or using a cross-platform framework like Ionic?
noaheverett	687312624497913856	2016-01-13T16:37:53	vlucas oh cool, looking at it now...I could actually use this with my diet / workout plan
noaheverett	687312323921461248	2016-01-13T16:36:42	DelinaDimova so far it's easier and cleaner via Pingly to chat...as far as more connected, I guess I'll know that in time :)
noaheverett	687311559308259328	2016-01-13T16:33:40	vlucas let me know when you release it, would like to check it out
noaheverett	687311169816768512	2016-01-13T16:32:07	DelinaDimova frustrated with email over years, it's clunky when used to msg ppl, wanted a "chat" style app that worked over other networks
noaheverett	687310356205682692	2016-01-13T16:28:53	mrdoob since Twitter acquired it they may have added the comment export, but I'm honestly not for sure, sorry I couldn't be of more help!
noaheverett	687308725527408640	2016-01-13T16:22:24	vlucas thanks man! I hope you still do it...would it be about the app we chatted about last year?
noaheverett	687307949501485056	2016-01-13T16:19:19	DelinaDimova it's a messaging app the works over Email &amp; SMS, this way even if your contacts aren't on Pingly you can still talk with them
noaheverett	687306869170397184	2016-01-13T16:15:01	DelinaDimova thanks Delina! appreciate the kind words

noaheverett	685230801299095552	2016-01-07T22:45:28	robgt haha true...Medium is free though too correct? However with Wordpress you have infinitely more control
