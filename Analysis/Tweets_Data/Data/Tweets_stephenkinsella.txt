stephenkinsella	719090499727015936	2016-04-10T09:11:49	7. Finally, the morality, etc., of tax and spending I’ve been reading today is just rebranded populism. A better discussion needed there.
stephenkinsella	719090197418405888	2016-04-10T09:10:37	6. You don’t have to like these practices, but you do have to recognise the discussion should sit in the space of all possible rules.
stephenkinsella	719089846136999936	2016-04-10T09:09:14	5. Understanding that any rule set will be gamed instantly should not attach any degree of moral opprobrium to the players.
stephenkinsella	719088969800146944	2016-04-10T09:05:45	4. The fact that lobbyists are working to restrict pushes towards transparency tells you nothing about those funds and a lot about lobbyists
stephenkinsella	719088718632640512	2016-04-10T09:04:45	3. In an Irish context we should push for maximum transparency, especially for funds, as a condition of doing business here.
stephenkinsella	719088336720236544	2016-04-10T09:03:14	2. When the ppl using the rules to legally reduce their tax bill are the same ppl who make the rules, extra transparency is required.
stephenkinsella	719088127684558848	2016-04-10T09:02:24	1.  using entirely legal mechanisms to reduce your tax bill necessitates a discussion of the rules and not the ppl using the rules.
