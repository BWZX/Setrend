JohnKicklighter	722121347187535876	2016-04-18T17:55:20	...more than a little effort in these public remarks to get the hold outs to more quickly return to the negotiation table
JohnKicklighter	722121250806591488	2016-04-18T17:54:57	The discussion at Doha must have been particularly acrimonious. A bunch of attendees have spoken about their plans to increase production
JohnKicklighter	722120135205593088	2016-04-18T17:50:31	Trader Poll: Does US Oil break 45 or 35 first? A lot of supply-demand assumptions to that vote.

JohnKicklighter	721920130595168256	2016-04-18T04:35:46	My intern ran the numbers and it seems the Doha meeting led to the biggest USDCAD gap (absolute terms) in nearly 13 years
JohnKicklighter	721894814300504064	2016-04-18T02:55:10	So much for headline inflation. Like Punxsutawney Phil, add another six months of Fed indecision
JohnKicklighter	721894425304039425	2016-04-18T02:53:37	One of the biggest gaps from oil and the CAD crosses in a long time after the Doha meeting fell apart

JohnKicklighter	721149056831983616	2016-04-16T01:31:48	A fresh, recent record net long Yen speculative futures position. Will the BoJ start pointing to it? USDJPY 
JohnKicklighter	721148829857284096	2016-04-16T01:30:53	Net speculative futures positioning behind the $USDollar is the lowest its been since since August. Wide divergence 
JohnKicklighter	721148620372713473	2016-04-16T01:30:04	Let's see how bold the short vol crowd is amid all these major fundamental themes. VIX and COT net spec:

JohnKicklighter	721101016570003456	2016-04-15T22:20:54	The primer we made on OPEC and key non-OPEC members last month: 
JohnKicklighter	721100786298707970	2016-04-15T22:19:59	Do you think the Doha meeting will result in a cap/cut in output that lifts oil or impasse that drives it lower?
JohnKicklighter	721057404700504065	2016-04-15T19:27:36	Dang. Had an idea to open a bank that attracts the next generation of account holders, but 'Gringotts Bank' is trademarked

JohnKicklighter	721048745207533568	2016-04-15T18:53:11	So, let's see what comes of this Doha meeting on Sunday. Cap/cut production despite some participants not joining?
JohnKicklighter	721048579821989888	2016-04-15T18:52:32	...with oil shipments finally picking up. So, Iran has little interest in joining OPEC production cap. Stalls OPEC agreement sans Iran
JohnKicklighter	721048310316929028	2016-04-15T18:51:28	...because it can't get agreement from OPEC and non-OPEC producers to maintain market share. Iran just had some sanctions lifted...
JohnKicklighter	721048112941436932	2016-04-15T18:50:41	Is Iran preventing Fed hikes? Fed says lack of inflation, but transient on oil. Oil price low on sustained output. OPEC doesn't cut output..
JohnKicklighter	721026987796664325	2016-04-15T17:26:44	The G-20 mention of concern over a possible 'Brexit shock' confers a global misgiving to this otherwise regional risk
JohnKicklighter	721026747513364482	2016-04-15T17:25:47	The G-20 also suggests they may raise penalties against tax havens in the wake of the Panama Papers. Significant if it gains traction
JohnKicklighter	721026470722859008	2016-04-15T17:24:41	...so, if no members cry foul in the future amid big changes, we have to assume collaboration ('collusion' is the better word) on efforts

JohnKicklighter	721005130934411264	2016-04-15T15:59:53	Not surprising that SPX isn't forging ahead so late in the week with limited fundamental backing:
