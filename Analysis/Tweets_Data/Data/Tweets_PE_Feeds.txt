PE_Feeds	708797436542754816	2016-03-12T23:30:52	MikeDuda the difference is writing with people you're close with and trust versus going out and trying to find a lead.

PE_Feeds	708055959298564097	2016-03-10T22:24:30	BrienBuckman I guess the way to make it work is build Square directly into their app network (like a Whole Foods app)
PE_Feeds	708055091710922753	2016-03-10T22:21:03	EXACTLY. And because Square controls the POS terminals, they control the data. 
PE_Feeds	708054982919122944	2016-03-10T22:20:37	BrienBuckman EXACTLY. Also, you should meet ShastriMahadeo
PE_Feeds	708054316075065344	2016-03-10T22:17:58	5/ Basically it's the evolution of the checkout scanner.
PE_Feeds	708054155676491776	2016-03-10T22:17:20	4/ Locations could then use the data to send promotions (coupons, bundling, etc.), making that data 1000% more useful to consumers.
PE_Feeds	708054021144236032	2016-03-10T22:16:48	3/ Imagine if Square was able to categorize what you bought and thus have it in your buyer profile by location, tag, etc.
PE_Feeds	708053855129477121	2016-03-10T22:16:08	2/ Everybody focused on the receipt itself, and NOT the line items (aka what you bought).
PE_Feeds	708053714972631043	2016-03-10T22:15:35	1/ While meeting with ShastriMahadeo today, we just realized what jack meant when he said we need to disrupt the receipt.
