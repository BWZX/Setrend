patrickc	726166081082155008	2016-04-29T21:47:39	Questionable tactics but so much obvious good in fixing the insane paywall system.
patrickc	726165854832988161	2016-04-29T21:46:45	Very interesting piece on Sci-Hub: . Surprising that it took so long for something like this to exist.

patrickc	725070081877774337	2016-04-26T21:12:33	It's been interesting to see that our first couple of applications to BYOT have been teams with 50/50 men/women splits.
patrickc	725041802818936833	2016-04-26T19:20:11	EricaJoy Was clear to me (and him!) that she was just as effective in their work together, though.
patrickc	725041631607574528	2016-04-26T19:19:30	EricaJoy Tech cos valued him (standard well-credentialed engineer), really bad at understanding her. (Newer to industry, no CS degree).

patrickc	724738754494128128	2016-04-25T23:15:58	shaft We already do! With you 100% on this.
patrickc	724722227900370945	2016-04-25T22:10:18	shaft We'll update the post to reflect some of this discussion too.
patrickc	724721608850427904	2016-04-25T22:07:50	shaft Good q. Will discuss that with the team.
patrickc	724720297090273281	2016-04-25T22:02:38	shaft Central was a friend and former colleague being absolutely adamant that we should hire.
patrickc	724720126675685377	2016-04-25T22:01:57	shaft If it doesn't, we'll adjust or stop.
patrickc	724720015560183808	2016-04-25T22:01:31	shaft More broadly, since it seems it *could* help, we wanted to try it. I hate the ratio of talk to action in industry.
patrickc	724719866452709378	2016-04-25T22:00:55	shaft Groups already migrate from company to company. We want to make sure we get *everyone*, not just those who look like what we expect.
patrickc	724719143493062657	2016-04-25T21:58:03	shaft This is how we hired our first woman in eng -- an econ major who had only been programming for a year or two. And she was amazing!
patrickc	724718957081456640	2016-04-25T21:57:18	shaft Because people can say "I know this person has unusual background but they're *awesome*!"
patrickc	724718507141648385	2016-04-25T21:55:31	shaft Regardless, will absolutely be running program with this question (and goal) in mind.
patrickc	724718357467930625	2016-04-25T21:54:55	shaft Part of idea's genesis was noticing that some of people from most unusual backgrounds at Stripe were hired as part of teams like this
patrickc	724718044052750336	2016-04-25T21:53:40	shaft Goal is to better identify undervalued/underrepresented talent by not just applying traditional SV interview standards.
patrickc	724714540089253888	2016-04-25T21:39:45	sean_a_rose Yeah, hard to know for sure. But given that it could work/help, we wanted to try it. We'll pay close attention to this.
patrickc	724714115302748160	2016-04-25T21:38:04	sarahmei On contrary, we don't want to restrict team hiring to the set of founders with access to capital. Others deserve it too!
patrickc	724713112767602688	2016-04-25T21:34:05	sean_a_rose Regardless, the standard SV approach empirically does not work well. So we want to start trying things and not just talking.
patrickc	724712704213012480	2016-04-25T21:32:27	sean_a_rose And to overcome some of their associated structural biases. We'll monitor the results closely, though.
patrickc	724712442882744321	2016-04-25T21:31:25	sean_a_rose First woman we hired in eng was part of a team like this. Our hope is that this is a way to get past traditional SV interviews.
patrickc	724711785845018625	2016-04-25T21:28:48	tqbf Correct, that's the intent.
patrickc	724711596769964033	2016-04-25T21:28:03	tqbf But it's what we're trying to avoid.
patrickc	724711545062592512	2016-04-25T21:27:51	tqbf Hiring is complicated (as you know, I think :)), so I can't say that what you describe will categorically never happen.
patrickc	724711244431642624	2016-04-25T21:26:39	tqbf The whole motivation behind making the commitment pass/fail is to avoid trying to split teams -- we don't like being in that position.
patrickc	724710133167587328	2016-04-25T21:22:14	ninavizz hunterwalk We will monitor the results closely! It's at least clear that the standard approaches don't work so well.
patrickc	724709579632705537	2016-04-25T21:20:02	ninavizz jess stripe avibryant On contrary, I hope this moves us past traditional SV interviews &amp; helps us overcome some of its biases.
patrickc	724707956890042369	2016-04-25T21:13:36	hunterwalk And, more broadly, I hope that this is a way to help us move beyond the traditional SV interview process.
patrickc	724707607336775680	2016-04-25T21:12:12	hunterwalk My hope is that it helps. The first woman in engineering at Stripe was part of a two-person team we hired.
patrickc	724704888018468864	2016-04-25T21:01:24	3/ Yet virtually 100% of our hiring scenarios treat individuals outside of the context of their near network and coworkers.
patrickc	724704603602735106	2016-04-25T21:00:16	2/ If you zoom out a little, talent travels in packs. People follow their friends and colleagues to new roles.
patrickc	724704410262097922	2016-04-25T20:59:30	1/ Here's what I love about stripe's Bring Your Own Team (apply as a team) experiment... ()

patrickc	724339335210762241	2016-04-24T20:48:49	sacca rabois paulg We at least need to standardize Easter. Bane of metrics teams everywhere.

patrickc	724337656436416514	2016-04-24T20:42:09	rabois paulg Yep. We've settled on trailing 28 day Y/Y as good combination of seasonally smooth but also unforgiving.
patrickc	724336433087938560	2016-04-24T20:37:17	paulg Corollary (from early Stripe experience): metrics are an emotional rollercoaster until you accumulate the seasonality dataset.
patrickc	724334711737180161	2016-04-24T20:30:27	stewartbrand interesting in the attitude / disposition. Reminds me of Carroll too:

patrickc	689703261507444736	2016-01-20T06:57:26	Trump and Palin: linguistically, both candidates from the post-sentence era of politics. Like badly tuned Markov generators.

patrickc	688117752456851458	2016-01-15T21:57:11	Favorite stripe user discovery of the week:  covers bail to fight a flawed justice system.

patrickc	688102196517289984	2016-01-15T20:55:22	Stripe is hiring machine learning scientists/engineers. Let me know if you (or anyone you know) might be interested!

patrickc	687129683230498816	2016-01-13T04:30:57	(Early on, was a challenge for us when talking to investors.  Reaction from those who'd dealt with payments: üòÉüåüüíØ. Those who hadn't: ü§î.)

patrickc	685950464932720640	2016-01-09T22:25:09	anildash Btw, there's an interesting discussion of this in The Gospel According to the Simpsons (of all places): 
patrickc	685946741082853376	2016-01-09T22:10:22	anildash yup for sure
patrickc	685946643393282048	2016-01-09T22:09:58	StephenIbachQED anildash Oh, I'm not defending it. I'm just pointing out that, per his original tweet, that does indeed take place.
patrickc	685943175664373762	2016-01-09T21:56:11	anildash I think these magazines *are* totally willing to be sacrilegious with Christian imagery too.

patrickc	684943126323052544	2016-01-07T03:42:21	.forbes I thought this headline was a bit harsh: 
patrickc	684265095464001536	2016-01-05T06:48:06	sw albertwenger yes, exactly, I think
patrickc	684252173564157952	2016-01-05T05:56:45	albertwenger agreed!
patrickc	684121173257404416	2016-01-04T21:16:12	sacca We're grateful for the many rounds you helped us put together. üçª
patrickc	683895336608268288	2016-01-04T06:18:49	As usual, the  annual question makes for excellent reading: 
patrickc	683877513089564673	2016-01-04T05:07:59	sean_a_rose Best part is clearly the discussion of twin engine planes in the screenshot. (Stripe is still working on solving.) collision
patrickc	683727129264046080	2016-01-03T19:10:25	lorakolodny No. I have a little ex officio stature as result of association with promising startup. But no delusions of power beyond that.
patrickc	683724652737245184	2016-01-03T19:00:34	gaberivera Indeed. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  (And I don't mean to wax all sanctimonious. I happily VC-bait too!)
patrickc	683723945636278272	2016-01-03T18:57:46	gaberivera You could say, "well, just be more careful and don't be wrong!" But even with best intentions, that ends up fairly difficult.
patrickc	683723698705043456	2016-01-03T18:56:47	gaberivera (I'm not powerful but I certainly steer clear of asserting much that could be controversial.)
patrickc	683723551849844736	2016-01-03T18:56:12	gaberivera On the other hand, I suspect net effect is to make most shy away from saying much at all.
patrickc	683723344974225412	2016-01-03T18:55:23	gaberivera Now, many of those are not exactly people who face a whole lot of adversity on the whole. So, on some level, who cares?
patrickc	683722947010285568	2016-01-03T18:53:48	gaberivera So this is an interesting point. I often feel like we vilify people with mistaken ideas far too much.
patrickc	683721345272647680	2016-01-03T18:47:26	RurikBradbury gaberivera If wrong, this makes them *easier* to criticize and reject.
patrickc	683721209423368192	2016-01-03T18:46:53	RurikBradbury gaberivera I was talking about Twitter, not essays. But either way, I'm in favor of powerful people expressing their views.
patrickc	683714819879387136	2016-01-03T18:21:30	tommycollison I thought your new book on Islam answered this charge pretty well in the introduction
patrickc	683712546847633408	2016-01-03T18:12:28	gaberivera I think Twitter sucks as a debate medium in many ways but man do I appreciate having it compared to counterfactual world.
patrickc	683712362965159936	2016-01-03T18:11:44	gaberivera Tbf, would we prefer they didn't engage, did so privately, or did so in medium that doesn't make disagreement easy?
patrickc	683452487487995904	2016-01-03T00:59:05	Another: last few months of  have been great.

patrickc	681574129468702720	2015-12-28T20:35:10	b0rk I've found it really useful. And doesn't really take too long to learn.
