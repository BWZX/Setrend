matthewherper	720983159756599298	2016-04-15T14:32:35	(7/7) TLDR: Clickbait makes people click and it’s not always bad. Context matters. Stories need marketing too. Have a great weekend everyone
matthewherper	720983088897994753	2016-04-15T14:32:18	(6/7) Headlines are designed to market a story in limited characters. Not fair to insta-judge a journalist based on their marketing copy.
