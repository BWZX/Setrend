GlennF	723180820752527361	2016-04-21T16:05:18	mamster I am kind of freaked out about potency, b/c the stuff I used to smoke was reasonably intense or I am very susceptible.
GlennF	723180209449500672	2016-04-21T16:02:52	mamster The pot I had access to in the 80s was grown outdoor, and probably near Eugene, where I lived. I was buying CSA‚Ä¶
GlennF	723180111948734464	2016-04-21T16:02:29	mamster It might be. Hydroponic pot was intensively cultivated for higher THC; the outdoor stuff, not as much.

GlennF	723177763276886016	2016-04-21T15:53:09	mamster So I still disagree w/you. Dosage is key, but the potency is very different from alcohol, as is the persistence in system.
GlennF	723177666703036417	2016-04-21T15:52:46	mamster I‚Äôve avoided pot for many years, b/c the increased potency is more like a hallucinogen than it was when I was a kid.
