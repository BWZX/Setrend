sturdyAlex	721302351387222017	2016-04-16T11:40:56	In short, here is why I find every single brexit scenario to be utter bunkum.

sturdyAlex	721292641854427136	2016-04-16T11:02:21	annwitbrock My argument is simply this: what is being proposed is to exit the EU in terms of citizens' rights, but remain entirely wedded&gt;
sturdyAlex	721289799362088960	2016-04-16T10:51:03	annwitbrock I wrote a big piece about it six months ago.

sturdyAlex	721287793989795840	2016-04-16T10:43:05	annwitbrock If you think that Exit and Remain feed nationalism and isolationism to the same extent, you are in profound denial.
sturdyAlex	721287186604244992	2016-04-16T10:40:40	annwitbrock Sorry. Mum time now.
sturdyAlex	721262153345458176	2016-04-16T09:01:12	annwitbrock I don't. I am keenly aware not only on which side of an argument I am, but also with whom. "Useful idiots" is how it begins.
sturdyAlex	721261768132161536	2016-04-16T08:59:40	annwitbrock You seem to think that this decision can be separated from the right-wing, regressive, isolationist politics it will embolden.

sturdyAlex	721249875975892993	2016-04-16T08:12:25	annwitbrock Because the emotional basis of the argument isn't "someone else". "Someone else" makes the laws anyway. It's "someone foreign".

sturdyAlex	685384260895793152	2016-01-08T08:55:16	mikeysmith So, you agree that if it was as the BBC wrote at the time, rather than as presented by Doughty after the event, all is not ok?

sturdyAlex	685382655119093760	2016-01-08T08:48:53	mikeysmith I'll try. To me the key phrase is "she was speaking to one junior shadow minister who was considering resigning".

sturdyAlex	685378169873002496	2016-01-08T08:31:04	Evidently some at the BBC are not as unequivocal that what happened was just "good journalism" or they wouldn't have taken down the blog.

sturdyAlex	685376847627087872	2016-01-08T08:25:48	mikeysmith Is it seriously a subject of debate that different and more stringent rules apply to TV in general and the BBC in particular?

sturdyAlex	685376302963126272	2016-01-08T08:23:38	No. It isn't "just a scoop". The BBC is not funded, nor should it ever operate, like the Daily Star. This is reflected in their own charter.
sturdyAlex	685375075206455296	2016-01-08T08:18:46	101objects Yes. A newspaper isn't funded compulsorily by tax.
sturdyAlex	685374783333220352	2016-01-08T08:17:36	mikeysmith I disagree. It's not really a reason to swear at me. The BBC can't be that sure or they wouldn't have taken down the blog.
