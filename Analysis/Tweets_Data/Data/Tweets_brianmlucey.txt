brianmlucey	725414995341746184	2016-04-27T20:03:07	Among other things, the election of LynnToWin shows the absolutely transformative power of higher education access programs
brianmlucey	725413730859802624	2016-04-27T19:58:05	A truly magnificent example of what access to education can achieve not just for individuals, but for us all 
brianmlucey	725409482436648961	2016-04-27T19:41:12	Elected to third seat in the TCDSeanad election tcdsu President Lynn Ruane celebrates with her family and friends 
brianmlucey	725410537165709312	2016-04-27T19:45:24	As a TCD graduate I look at our TCDSeanad choices and I'm incredibly proud of how many Rónán Mullens there aren't.
brianmlucey	725406953132941313	2016-04-27T19:31:09	Im so so proud to have been nominator for LynnToWin , proud of tcddublin TAP program which got her in the door.
brianmlucey	725406471366803456	2016-04-27T19:29:14	If LynnToWin continues her personal trajectory she will be Queen Emperor of the Known Galaxy by her early 40s TCDSeanad
brianmlucey	725405661752877058	2016-04-27T19:26:01	Disappointed for Seán Barrett, made a fantastic contribution on economic/enterprise policy. Delira for LynnToWin  bright star TCDSeanad.
brianmlucey	725405154690768897	2016-04-27T19:24:00	Hard luck sdcbarrett TCDSeanad Seanad16

brianmlucey	725404644013383680	2016-04-27T19:21:59	universitytimes Massive thanks and congratulations on the live updates. Have been following since lunchtime! Well done! TCDSeanad
brianmlucey	725404534722445313	2016-04-27T19:21:33	So TCDSeanad has just become the first Oireachtas constituency ever (I think?) to not have a straight male elected Seanad16
brianmlucey	725404256539389953	2016-04-27T19:20:26	A pretty bittersweet moment - TCD loses a great known Senator in sdcbarrett and gains a hopefully great one in LynnToWin TCDSeanad
brianmlucey	725403324242079744	2016-04-27T19:16:44	Lynn Ruane has been elected on the 15th count TCDSeanad 
brianmlucey	725401847515746306	2016-04-27T19:10:52	only way universitytimes could have improved their coverage of TCDSeanad is periscope of the actual results ! Excellent work all
brianmlucey	725398208684396544	2016-04-27T18:56:24	This cant end well  
brianmlucey	725386938711199744	2016-04-27T18:11:37	Either way, sdcbarrett or LynnToWin will be great senators TCD will return a solid slate tcdseanad
brianmlucey	725384522821427201	2016-04-27T18:02:01	The universitytimes coverage of the TCDSeanad count has been excellent by any standard particularly impressive for student journalists.
brianmlucey	725379745156837378	2016-04-27T17:43:02	gavreilly oh ys. no doubt
brianmlucey	725379550738309121	2016-04-27T17:42:16	22 votes between Ruane and Barrett. Bacik surplus of 127 plus Power's votes to be distributed. Down to the wire, as they say. TCDSeanad
brianmlucey	725379375118561280	2016-04-27T17:41:34	so all down to AevrilPower transfers in TCDSeanad  : LynnToWin needs 23 more than sdcbarrett to be elected...
brianmlucey	725378021914480640	2016-04-27T17:36:11	Tally has Lynn Ruane just 4 ahead of Sean Barrett after 13th count in TCDSeanad. And Bacik elected. Power transfers will decide 3rd seat.
brianmlucey	725353973167874048	2016-04-27T16:00:38	universitytimes are putting professional media to shame with the quality of their Seanad16 TCD updates
brianmlucey	725367009576386560	2016-04-27T16:52:26	It's not over yet. Clonan's votes are going to Bacik, then more to Barrett than Ruane. TCDSeanad Seanad16 
brianmlucey	725366040474083328	2016-04-27T16:48:35	sandernistas But then, the Seanad is hardly a hotbed of bolshevik intrigue, so some degree of debate would be no harm
brianmlucey	725365876422246401	2016-04-27T16:47:56	sandernistas Suspect, as someone who endorsed her and having seen her in action, shes more left of center than hard left.
brianmlucey	725362765653770240	2016-04-27T16:35:34	Real fight on for the 3rd TCDSeanad seat. I'm thinking it might just break Ruane's way.
brianmlucey	725362427131494400	2016-04-27T16:34:13	sandernistas wouldnt underestimate teh difficulty of tallying on the n-th count :)
brianmlucey	725361152688054273	2016-04-27T16:29:10	And a cheery LynnToWin  also with Mystery Frenchman at TCDSeanad 
brianmlucey	725358981460463616	2016-04-27T16:20:32	Team sdcbarrett looking unflapped at TCDSeanad count. cjwlarkin UrsulaNiChoill , himself and some French dude... 
brianmlucey	725357388237275136	2016-04-27T16:14:12	So my transfers are breaking to Ruane as much as to Bacik and more than to Barrett or Power.  TCDSeanad
brianmlucey	725353546187677701	2016-04-27T15:58:56	tcdseanad Barrett pulling away is probably good for Ruane as well- the next two are left-leaning and she needs Power to go out before him
brianmlucey	725351642246352896	2016-04-27T15:51:22	LeftistLunatic so dont blame the university senators. They want reform. And they are the broadest electorate of the senate.

brianmlucey	725348882692116480	2016-04-27T15:40:24	LeftistLunatic Danny, youll know when I get personal. Believe me.

brianmlucey	725348644107472896	2016-04-27T15:39:27	LeftistLunatic gotcha. But its 49 as 11 appointed
brianmlucey	725348116220796928	2016-04-27T15:37:21	LeftistLunatic As am I. But, this is what we have. You cant claim its not representative as it is, democracy being those who turn up.
brianmlucey	725347569719726082	2016-04-27T15:35:11	LeftistLunatic No, I havent. I have noted that he says what he says; he gets elected. To claim hes not representative is patently wrong.
brianmlucey	725347440287727617	2016-04-27T15:34:40	LeftistLunatic Plus, its on behalf of 4,500,000 people.
brianmlucey	725347369546600448	2016-04-27T15:34:23	LeftistLunatic And yet, somehow, I sense that if it ws Senator Danny Rigg youd be singing a different tune?
brianmlucey	725347215934427136	2016-04-27T15:33:47	EmerHunt emigrated. Moved and didnt tell college. Dont ask me. I voted. Iv voted in every election since 1982.
brianmlucey	725346056175796224	2016-04-27T15:29:10	LeftistLunatic and yet 4k people voted for him. Others voted for RonanMullen ; thats democracy.

brianmlucey	719090499727015936	2016-04-10T09:11:49	7. Finally, the morality, etc., of tax and spending I’ve been reading today is just rebranded populism. A better discussion needed there.
brianmlucey	719090197418405888	2016-04-10T09:10:37	6. You don’t have to like these practices, but you do have to recognise the discussion should sit in the space of all possible rules.
brianmlucey	719089846136999936	2016-04-10T09:09:14	5. Understanding that any rule set will be gamed instantly should not attach any degree of moral opprobrium to the players.
brianmlucey	719088336720236544	2016-04-10T09:03:14	2. When the ppl using the rules to legally reduce their tax bill are the same ppl who make the rules, extra transparency is required.
brianmlucey	719088127684558848	2016-04-10T09:02:24	1.  using entirely legal mechanisms to reduce your tax bill necessitates a discussion of the rules and not the ppl using the rules.
