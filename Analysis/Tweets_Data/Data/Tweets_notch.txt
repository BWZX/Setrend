notch	725643526852214785	2016-04-28T11:11:13	SkylerFur What about gloves?
notch	725642776260558848	2016-04-28T11:08:14	But a wheelbarrow and a bag lack intent too. Does the vehicle stop moving once the controller knows about mjolnir? 
notch	725641210833018880	2016-04-28T11:02:01	notch Since people can still fly the helicarrier, can you push the wheelbarrow. What about a bag? Could you swing the bag?
notch	725640994700595201	2016-04-28T11:01:09	So Thor can obviously put down Mjolnir on moving things like planets and helicarriers without immobilizing them. What about wheelbarrows?
