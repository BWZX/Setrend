mugatushair	719709479034580992	2016-04-12T02:11:26	victoriouscake implied odds problems are far easier systems to solve than doing it backwards. Key IMHO to making big bets w/o blow ups
mugatushair	719709221575651328	2016-04-12T02:10:24	victoriouscake look at payoff rates and then can calc implied odds. This lets you then minimize what we call "predictive burden"
mugatushair	719709053803438080	2016-04-12T02:09:44	victoriouscake you have your prediction rate and your payoff structure. Most people predict and then payoff secondary. Poker is opposite

mugatushair	707457778441445377	2016-03-09T06:47:32	SardonicaX I think it's fascinating to look at people's book concentration over time vs returns to gauge. When they get big is risk capped?
mugatushair	707457425851490304	2016-03-09T06:46:08	SardonicaX people who have disciplined process but will also punch it on "old school macro" trades are rare. Requires conflicting mindsets
mugatushair	707457122733260803	2016-03-09T06:44:56	SardonicaX absolutely. Otherwise how can you even claim to have an edge? No process = no edge.

mugatushair	707456041265528832	2016-03-09T06:40:38	SardonicaX Of course. But would also say willingness to go for it in extraordinary situation where edge is present isn't nothing.

mugatushair	707079800696008705	2016-03-08T05:45:36	nachkari inner_scorecard I don't follow your point. Upside is irrelevant. My point about survival is key in both.

mugatushair	707078976620068864	2016-03-08T05:42:19	nachkari inner_scorecard Optimism is emotional. Investing should be rational.
mugatushair	707078678811975683	2016-03-08T05:41:08	nachkari inner_scorecard Avoiding severe losses is the key. The upside takes care of itself. Optimism in and of itself is a weakness.
