bobbymacReports	704512889386741760	2016-03-01T03:45:36	NicDawes no doubt. Better examples are companies that give you the basics and use that to block enterprise work. Krittivasm

bobbymacReports	704508815417323522	2016-03-01T03:29:25	Krittivasm NicDawes no news outlet can afford (literally in some cases) to go against a central bank.
bobbymacReports	704508683133153280	2016-03-01T03:28:53	Krittivasm NicDawes Access in general is the poison chalice of any beat reporter. And the lockups are like holding news outlets hostage.
bobbymacReports	704508495157039105	2016-03-01T03:28:09	NicDawes but most journalists will accept someone else's limits rather than lose access, or the perception of access.
bobbymacReports	704508329385549824	2016-03-01T03:27:29	NicDawes that would be nice. My feeling is that it's often public space where these pens are set up. I can't see the problem with using it.
bobbymacReports	704507286895505408	2016-03-01T03:23:20	NicDawes I'm glad I don't face that choice. I can't understand why someone hasn't challenged the pen problem in court. Worth it.
bobbymacReports	704507130217263104	2016-03-01T03:22:43	NicDawes then there are the ratings, the media clients who might buy/distribute your stuff, the b roll, etc etc.
bobbymacReports	704506951728701440	2016-03-01T03:22:01	NicDawes if your shop decides you'd rather not have the story than accept the rules, that's fine for your shop. But...
bobbymacReports	704506808992288769	2016-03-01T03:21:27	NicDawes same old story as agreeing to embargoes and other ground rules. If you want any day coverage, you end up allowing this to happen.
