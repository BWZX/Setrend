sarahcuda	725395244640952320	2016-04-27T18:44:38	i love this 
sarahcuda	725395204648247296	2016-04-27T18:44:28	even more damning analogy today given Kevin's blistering Twitter piece!

sarahcuda	725382354877829120	2016-04-27T17:53:25	"Any time a media company says people love its ads watch out." 
sarahcuda	725381833546854400	2016-04-27T17:51:20	Twitter is essentially destroying the ONE thing it did better than FB   wow
sarahcuda	725381621415874560	2016-04-27T17:50:30	"But Twitter sees the future in video, so cannibalizing its cash cow is okay, right?"  Twitter is even more f'd

sarahcuda	725379254691622912	2016-04-27T17:41:05	oh i have no doubt it's symbolic for Uber. that's why it's gross that she agreed to be used that way 
sarahcuda	725379067940229120	2016-04-27T17:40:21	also, that i was completely wrong about her
sarahcuda	725378967138504704	2016-04-27T17:39:57	i guess the ariannahuff news today proves that i wouldn't have been able to do the same work had i stayed at AOL techcrunch
sarahcuda	725358867236839425	2016-04-27T16:20:05	Uh-oh: The iPhone is no longer the status symbol it once was in China.

sarahcuda	725373267964473344	2016-04-27T17:17:18	Disgusting that ariannahuff joins board of Uber‚Äîwhich openly threatens critical journalists. But consistent w/this: 
sarahcuda	725377458774663168	2016-04-27T17:33:57	for someone who prioritizes sleep so much, wonder how ariannahuff actually does at night... 
sarahcuda	725370964456947712	2016-04-27T17:08:09	sarahcuda ariannahuff even someone like me who isn't a journalist felt the disappointment. I suppose morales are not high on the agenda ..
sarahcuda	725376365667606528	2016-04-27T17:29:37	the lies we tell ourselves to make money in the valley  
sarahcuda	725376196494561284	2016-04-27T17:28:56	funny if it weren't so disgusting that she's sold out women and journalists 
sarahcuda	725376082405289984	2016-04-27T17:28:29	i'm sure she tells herself/others those lies. women look up to her tho. I did once. this is heartbreaking 
sarahcuda	725370057673461760	2016-04-27T17:04:33	she's betrayed journalists AND women. disgusting. 
sarahcuda	725369995182493698	2016-04-27T17:04:18	sadly yes 
sarahcuda	725369947778490368	2016-04-27T17:04:06	millions spent on the best political handlers will do that 
sarahcuda	725369756459487233	2016-04-27T17:03:21	We see it in every reality show: the women who undermine women by siding with "bros" today it's ariannahuff
sarahcuda	725369633667076098	2016-04-27T17:02:52	reminder: even UN Women refused to be associated with Uber bc of its treatment of women. ariannahuff is cool with it tho
sarahcuda	725369370898124804	2016-04-27T17:01:49	just disgusting.
sarahcuda	725369332176289792	2016-04-27T17:01:40	As a woman, really disappointed in ariannahuff. first she sits at a dinner where Uber execs threaten/smear journalists then joins the board

sarahcuda	725063556496916480	2016-04-26T20:46:37	I still can‚Äôt shake the feeling that AAPL is slowly taking themselves private.

sarahcuda	725053345430396930	2016-04-26T20:06:03	passing is fine! I'm just saying the "reason" articulated wasn't my experience at all being a parent.  
sarahcuda	725053112529084416	2016-04-26T20:05:07	and i don't have a husband or any child care or family near. i binge watch, work, go to eat, go to movies just fine 
sarahcuda	725052785222373377	2016-04-26T20:03:49	my point is I can't think of anything kids didn't "allow" me to do + way more joy than i could've imagined 
sarahcuda	725052373152993281	2016-04-26T20:02:11	lol. well put! 
sarahcuda	725052241355362307	2016-04-26T20:01:39	oh wow. can't. 
sarahcuda	725051942280507396	2016-04-26T20:00:28	totally different. live video isn't mainstream product but doesn't have to be. very different purpose for FB 
sarahcuda	725051272181719042	2016-04-26T19:57:48	i wasted so much time buying the "fear" argument of parenting destroying your life/career. hasn't been the case  
sarahcuda	725051014244655104	2016-04-26T19:56:47	like being an entrepreneur or other extreme situations, you don't know which you will arise from change/challenge 
sarahcuda	725050566104256512	2016-04-26T19:55:00	"selfish" isn't the right word bc it's your life. you don't owe anyone having a kid. my point is orthogonal 
sarahcuda	725049997163638784	2016-04-26T19:52:44	again, that's really fear of the unknown talking 
sarahcuda	725049918252023810	2016-04-26T19:52:25	neither true in my experience  
sarahcuda	725049557726420992	2016-04-26T19:50:59	parenting looks harder/worse from the outside than it actually is, IMHO.  
sarahcuda	725049289588744192	2016-04-26T19:49:56	not that i believe everyone HAS to have kids. but these are things i wish someone had told me. you can still be you 
sarahcuda	725049014811545601	2016-04-26T19:48:50	i feel like a lot of times it's fear of the unknown not selfishness that's behind this argument.  
sarahcuda	725048821085003776	2016-04-26T19:48:04	I'd also argue that time isn't finite. When you have kids you become a time traveler. it all expands: love, time 
sarahcuda	725048350534422528	2016-04-26T19:46:12	that's one reason i want to be with my kids every moment. They make me SUCH a better person than i've ever been  
sarahcuda	725048260071673857	2016-04-26T19:45:50	put another way: If i waited to mysteriously become selfless enough for kids i would have never had them 
sarahcuda	725048131881177090	2016-04-26T19:45:20	FWIW the great thing abt my kids is they CHANGED me and made me a better person.

sarahcuda	704707905681948672	2016-03-01T16:40:32	if you can't lead deals even at the SEED level, i don't really understand what game you are playing 
sarahcuda	704707831576924160	2016-03-01T16:40:14	you can argue strategically if a small firm is the best one to be a lead, if they can help fill the round

sarahcuda	693215226687164416	2016-01-29T23:32:44	:( 
sarahcuda	693201035611996160	2016-01-29T22:36:20	sarahcuda I learned about BB from Hayley when she was Co-CEO (very impressed by her). Katia + team will persevere. 
sarahcuda	693215112862109696	2016-01-29T23:32:16	thomascornelius *duh*
sarahcuda	693194854436737024	2016-01-29T22:11:46	amy_pfister haha on THAT we can agree! :)
sarahcuda	693193896784834560	2016-01-29T22:07:58	nope. (on the latter) that's just not true across all co.s. seems like you want them to fail with little evidence :( 
sarahcuda	693193206607970304	2016-01-29T22:05:14	amy_pfister I'm probably annoying the rest of my feed now! :) good chat. have a good friday!
sarahcuda	693193068627959808	2016-01-29T22:04:41	i certainly heard it with category overall. but they (+honest + justfab) were the ones who survived for a reason 
sarahcuda	693192883499696130	2016-01-29T22:03:56	uber just made cuts in its comms dept ffs. rebalancing is always part of startup life as is caution in down market 
sarahcuda	693192785558523904	2016-01-29T22:03:33	if we assumed co.s won't return capital bc they do a smallish layoff we'd think no one would ever return capital 
sarahcuda	693192139862179840	2016-01-29T22:00:59	you realize it's only a 15% RIF right? i think that's gonna be pretty common in 2016... 
sarahcuda	693192025542250496	2016-01-29T22:00:32	absolutely. low valuation, growing company, very small amt of cash in. don't see how they don't 
sarahcuda	693191843400388608	2016-01-29T21:59:49	BB fundraising, press, country/channel expansion, valuation = all pretty gradual and measured IMHO 
sarahcuda	693191614601166848	2016-01-29T21:58:54	not at all how i view them! interesting. they've always been very heads down. vs shoe dazzle, beach mint etc 
sarahcuda	693191087142236160	2016-01-29T21:56:48	to me they are the exact opposite of the unicorn/hype trend. they stayed pretty far from it 
sarahcuda	693191021388132352	2016-01-29T21:56:33	i think with BB the opposite. They've stayed lean. Not over built, not over cap'd, not over valued.  
sarahcuda	693190831881080832	2016-01-29T21:55:47	kdoohan it's the new Mr. Rogers Neighborhood but with a tiger. NOT kidding!
sarahcuda	693190043536478208	2016-01-29T21:52:39	curious- do you have any evidence of the latter? Or just assume? 
sarahcuda	693189922144976897	2016-01-29T21:52:10	davecraige paulcarr paul is sober and i'm a single mom ;) we don't grab beers ;)
sarahcuda	693189695006576642	2016-01-29T21:51:16	but HARD category and hard to build multichannel nonetheless 
sarahcuda	693189623548227584	2016-01-29T21:50:59	if they weren't doing extraordinarily well, $60m wouldn't last that long at their size/category 
sarahcuda	693189551498465280	2016-01-29T21:50:42	put it this way: first layoffs ever + haven't done a venture round in two years. that's by choice in this category.  
sarahcuda	693189448180199426	2016-01-29T21:50:17	definitely decided. they have ALWAYS been conservative. that's just katia. i've heard VCs complain abt it! 
sarahcuda	693189287370575872	2016-01-29T21:49:39	not to say Honest size-wise is uber (or in evil-ness! I like honest! ;) ) just strategic imp of beauty to them vs BB 
sarahcuda	693189040984567808	2016-01-29T21:48:40	beauty is BB's CORE. Like comparing Uber and Postmates  
sarahcuda	693188969979248640	2016-01-29T21:48:23	honest is doing it well capitalized, from strength and likely to grow into BIG valuation. different situation 
sarahcuda	693188562469015552	2016-01-29T21:46:46	om me too :(
sarahcuda	693188201754669056	2016-01-29T21:45:20	lastly, no visibility into Goop. not a huge fan as a consumer FWIW 
sarahcuda	693188112889950208	2016-01-29T21:44:59	category not by any means 100% the determiner of making cuts. more company specific as outlined in the piece 
sarahcuda	693188027418415104	2016-01-29T21:44:39	point on beauty and commerce is they certainly won't be *the easiest* sells in a tough climate when men write checks 
sarahcuda	693187902465966080	2016-01-29T21:44:09	but the larger point was: 1. macro environment 2. BB decided NOT to do a megaround 3. need to refocus categories 
sarahcuda	693187762338402304	2016-01-29T21:43:36	star power certainly helps make male VCs "get" honest. (also many have kids..get diapers. never will get lipgloss) 
sarahcuda	693187620847820800	2016-01-29T21:43:02	Honest is a VERY different category and GTM strategy. and raised far more capital in anticipation of slow down.
