AmbJohnBolton	710529051425939457	2016-03-17T18:11:41	The notion that the EU provides security from external threats is wholly false. It has made Europe less than the sum of its parts. Brexit
AmbJohnBolton	710526807834042368	2016-03-17T18:02:46	It’s important for Brits to know that not all Americans agree w/ Obama. US would actually benefit if British voters decide to Brexit. EU

AmbJohnBolton	710122739240202240	2016-03-16T15:17:09	Of course Obama loves the EU. His lack of int'l leadership perfectly mirrors the EU’s timid, ineffective defence of its own interests.
