DanaGoldstein	722894834516623360	2016-04-20T21:08:53	k_huff1 I hear you. I worry about moving caring adults who have community ties, too, but less so than moving kids.
DanaGoldstein	722893480121339904	2016-04-20T21:03:31	k_huff1 That is a fair critique when it comes to evaluation. School closures are certainly high stakes, however.
DanaGoldstein	722892197922611200	2016-04-20T20:58:25	mattyglesias What if there was a magnet program there that could convince more parents like you to enroll their kids? Dual language?
DanaGoldstein	722891095701467136	2016-04-20T20:54:02	halldjh It's a point that is just lost lost lost in the political debate
DanaGoldstein	722890287391985666	2016-04-20T20:50:49	mattyglesias personally I am a fan of using test scores in low-stakes ways, but not too many high-stakes ways
DanaGoldstein	722889868452319232	2016-04-20T20:49:09	mattyglesias going to make point I always make which is that using scores to gain knowledge is NOT same as using them for accountability
DanaGoldstein	722889268901781504	2016-04-20T20:46:46	mattyglesias Rick's piece is about whether school closures are the right policy mechanism in response to low scores
DanaGoldstein	722888255151017990	2016-04-20T20:42:45	mattyglesias Fair enough. I did that in my recent article. I think Rick has a critique of tests as a metric in his piece.
DanaGoldstein	722887170952790017	2016-04-20T20:38:26	mattyglesias odavis_ DanaGoldstein I reviewed some of the research on Chicago school reforms here (question 14) 
DanaGoldstein	722887038777708545	2016-04-20T20:37:55	mattyglesias I think what Rick asks is at what cost? And the evidence on school closures, especailly for older teens, not convincing
DanaGoldstein	722886165276135426	2016-04-20T20:34:27	mattyglesias You're right, NAEP out of Chicago has been good. I mentioned that in my recent Vice piece on strike 
DanaGoldstein	722884924429066240	2016-04-20T20:29:31	oh, the pain of being a writer :) 
DanaGoldstein	722884701153681408	2016-04-20T20:28:37	5. The belief in market reforms as the right thing for poor children, and test scores as right metric, is like a religion for some
DanaGoldstein	722884528339947521	2016-04-20T20:27:56	4. Rather, you can't overstate the extent to which ideology is a factor, even when collected evidence challenges that ideology.
DanaGoldstein	722884316603154432	2016-04-20T20:27:06	3. That isn't to say those aren't the *outcomes* of some of the policy changes rickperlstein describes
DanaGoldstein	722884157525786625	2016-04-20T20:26:28	2. I've come to conclusion that reformers are almost never driven by profit motive or desire to redirect funds toward white/wealthy schools
DanaGoldstein	722883876998111234	2016-04-20T20:25:21	1. I have some quibbles, but overall rickperlstein's take on school reform in Chicago is a tragic must-read
