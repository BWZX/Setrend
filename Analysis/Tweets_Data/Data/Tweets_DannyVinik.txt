DannyVinik	710841575232901120	2016-03-18T14:53:32	salimfurth Romney went that route right? He offered few details, s didn't add up. So many people in and out of the party want a plan
DannyVinik	710840924675416065	2016-03-18T14:50:57	salimfurth Particularly because Lee's original proposal was supposed to be revenue-neutral. Then Rubio joined and out went rev neutrality

DannyVinik	710839555180646400	2016-03-18T14:45:31	DannyVinik salimfurth I think it's more the tax cuts for the rich

DannyVinik	710839191077257216	2016-03-18T14:44:04	RichardRubinDC Yeah, I guess hard to know what voters took from that. Romney as pol for the rich stuck pretty well
DannyVinik	710838860415164416	2016-03-18T14:42:45	I also wonder if any down-ballot GOPers are running on this? It's logically the spot the GOP should move (who knows if they will)
DannyVinik	710838661840019456	2016-03-18T14:41:58	Probably not much different. But it would have at least showed GOP candidates willing to do something different from traditional policies

DannyVinik	684098923145900033	2016-01-04T19:47:47	The Obama admin's deportation raids began this weekend with 121 people taken into custody 
DannyVinik	684097614359465984	2016-01-04T19:42:35	hyperplanes Yep, he's talked about tithing with relation to taxes quite a bit
DannyVinik	684096486905384960	2016-01-04T19:38:07	MattBruenig salimfurth Yep, exactly
DannyVinik	684095438702665728	2016-01-04T19:33:57	hyperplanes salimfurth Yeah but that disguises the case for progressive taxation &amp; creates a impression that a real flat tax is reasonable
DannyVinik	684093553363054594	2016-01-04T19:26:27	salimfurth Carson's comments about proportionality, I think, were instructive.
DannyVinik	684093324102340609	2016-01-04T19:25:32	salimfurth Yeah, I think calling it a "flat tax" obscures that debate &amp; creates a impression that everyone paying a same % is a real option
DannyVinik	684092378202935296	2016-01-04T19:21:47	salimfurth TPCarney ..because otherwise it would slam the poor. So these "flat tax" proposals actually make the case for a progressive tax
DannyVinik	684092208853729281	2016-01-04T19:21:07	salimfurth TPCarney ... a direct rebuttal to a progressive tax structure. But no flat tax works that way. They all include a 0% rate...
DannyVinik	684092053450526725	2016-01-04T19:20:30	salimfurth TPCarney Maybe but even if so, the flat tax is advertised to the public as "fair" because everyone pays the same rate. It's...
DannyVinik	684091758565797888	2016-01-04T19:19:19	RichardRubinDC Yeah, I'm just looking at the flat tax with regards to brackets. No need to get into cap gains/dividends for that.
DannyVinik	684090898507001857	2016-01-04T19:15:54	TPCarney But it's not! If you make 20k under Carson's plan, your tax rate is 0. It's a progressive tax system, as are all tax proposals
DannyVinik	684090322083803137	2016-01-04T19:13:37	TPCarney Yep, the "flat tax" is a complete misnomer. Carson just exemplifies it better than everyone else
DannyVinik	684089896777216000	2016-01-04T19:11:55	Here's what the effective tax rate by income is under Ben Carson's (not so) "flat tax"  
DannyVinik	684058582711726080	2016-01-04T17:07:29	Is there a source for Carson saying his tax plan would boost growth to nearly 4 percent a year? I can't find one 
DannyVinik	684034608187457536	2016-01-04T15:32:13	Read TimothyNoah1 for why Obama really just has a few months left to issue new regulations 
DannyVinik	684004740578033664	2016-01-04T13:33:33	Guess wmata is still on vacation 
DannyVinik	682965174991630336	2016-01-01T16:42:41	haroldpollack thanks Harold! Happy new year to you!
DannyVinik	682321448485154818	2015-12-30T22:04:44	Is there any reasonable public policy defense of them? I can't think of one.
DannyVinik	682321349088555009	2015-12-30T22:04:21	The Rubio campaign's defense here is pretty bad. On a separate note, what's the reasoning for real estate licenses? 
DannyVinik	682283118485635076	2015-12-30T19:32:26	salimfurth Very interesting, thanks
DannyVinik	682281680443314176	2015-12-30T19:26:43	salimfurth what's this from?
DannyVinik	681968170475884544	2015-12-29T22:40:56	Donald Trump foregoing retail politics for big, impersonal rallies. Can it work in NH? CateMartel reports 
DannyVinik	681907204514017280	2015-12-29T18:38:41	The saga of whether the Carson campaign will be making personnel changes continues for another week (at least)! 
DannyVinik	681860372467421184	2015-12-29T15:32:35	"When you have to get earned media via ISIS, it's probably time to pack it in." 
DannyVinik	681648759927865348	2015-12-29T01:31:43	Good preview from lydiadepillis on labor issues in 2016 
DannyVinik	680137998021865472	2015-12-24T21:28:29	lindakinstler I didn't tell you? I'm learning Estonian!
