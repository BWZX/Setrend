jimcramer	711324143426387969	2016-03-19T22:51:06	Very true 
jimcramer	711316978477244416	2016-03-19T22:22:37	Today has been so pleasant. Nice people; good thoughts. I have not had to block anyone.. Really tremendous.  
jimcramer	711316751988998145	2016-03-19T22:21:43	As a heavy user we have had many discussions. But they have not embraced some of my ideas. Too hard to say here 
jimcramer	711316536368173058	2016-03-19T22:20:52	thank you! 
jimcramer	711316444282277888	2016-03-19T22:20:30	Thank you; so many fled AAPL during the downturn... 
jimcramer	711316283606888448	2016-03-19T22:19:52	Unfortunately Mexico, too.. So losing jobs to Mexico in part because of a lack of EPA kind of entity.  
jimcramer	711315011562557440	2016-03-19T22:14:49	I think AA can have a big run.

jimcramer	711313496236019713	2016-03-19T22:08:47	Yes, and the need for all people in all countries to do their part  
jimcramer	711313215179907072	2016-03-19T22:07:40	I have talked to them about this. They will never do it. The fear gating 
jimcramer	711313006135799808	2016-03-19T22:06:50	We discuss this a huge amount on our shows and in  try to watch a little if you can  
jimcramer	711312438289965056	2016-03-19T22:04:35	Gee-not so far! 
jimcramer	711312319343624192	2016-03-19T22:04:07	Very true concern-not a good format... 
jimcramer	711311124214337536	2016-03-19T21:59:22	I have Kentucky; good game!
jimcramer	711310637910126597	2016-03-19T21:57:26	no, I just watch the games and tweet. Wife doesn't care for March Madness. I am going to see Nova tomorrow!!!   
jimcramer	711310348947746816	2016-03-19T21:56:17	this chart is a big reason for the gains in AAPL's stock from the $93 level where many went negative  
jimcramer	711310140599885824	2016-03-19T21:55:27	I speak to a lot of potential advertisers who are concerned with the lack of quality control &amp; customer service or lack thereof
jimcramer	711309976107614208	2016-03-19T21:54:48	I think the Twitter people struggle with the advrtisers as they want to be affiliated with a friendlier atmosphere 
jimcramer	711309688936243201	2016-03-19T21:53:39	Very good long-term situation as long as you understand that coal is disappearing faster than most realize NSC 
jimcramer	711309471805546496	2016-03-19T21:52:48	One reason the Twitter people are stymied is the pure hatred/fear factor of Twitter. We talk about it quite a bit 
jimcramer	711309305820086272	2016-03-19T21:52:08	game on  
jimcramer	711309213847461888	2016-03-19T21:51:46	Candidly I have disliked it for a very long time. I had them on MadMoneyOnCNBC and said sell. But some love it 
jimcramer	711309047782363136	2016-03-19T21:51:07	We like lower risk BIIB but MNK has issues with its biggest drug, It has lots of allies though  
jimcramer	711308862016585734	2016-03-19T21:50:22	Don't care for S, have backed VZ forever, T is good too 
jimcramer	711308718307201025	2016-03-19T21:49:48	trolls are tiresome but can be defeated by endless blocking &amp; working with Twitter on the more threatening ones 
jimcramer	711308507480530944	2016-03-19T21:48:58	You have to go with higher quality; WWAV 
jimcramer	711308433476227076	2016-03-19T21:48:40	I like the work of BruceKamich on this. Worth a look ; some excellent thoughts.  
jimcramer	711307911243407361	2016-03-19T21:46:36	I am in total agreement and I say you have to be willing to absorb some pain in this group

jimcramer	711307492115009536	2016-03-19T21:44:56	Well put--not rancorous. Remember there are huge environmental ramifications..  
jimcramer	711306938261381120	2016-03-19T21:42:44	No, silly, Facebook isn't anonymous and is more civil. Twitter mgt knows this. We talk about it; a big worry 
jimcramer	711306736712417282	2016-03-19T21:41:56	It has been the way to go. Even with FCX 
jimcramer	711306605808259073	2016-03-19T21:41:24	Lot of misinterpretation on this. I link trade with global warming. NAFTA allows virtually unlimited pollution .  
jimcramer	711306139334524928	2016-03-19T21:39:33	Don't want to be too self-serving but  does great at it. I answer questions there

jimcramer	711304987335397376	2016-03-19T21:34:59	Interesting way to put it. But I will stay in touch with supportive smart people such as yourself!

jimcramer	711255785188229120	2016-03-19T18:19:28	Yes, but twitter allows for people to do no homework and just scream silly stuff 
jimcramer	711255547887099905	2016-03-19T18:18:31	It's a drag because i try to be an open guy and it really isn't as possible as it once was..

jimcramer	711254968020377601	2016-03-19T18:16:13	UNP broke out this week but I can't find any real eps momentum there. Could be a short squeeze or merger

jimcramer	704281724621099009	2016-02-29T12:27:02	Timely piece--Buffett struggles with Watson, too-who should pay whom.  
jimcramer	704281582719344640	2016-02-29T12:26:28	Amazing--China cuts rates oil bounces, takes S&amp;P futures with it.
jimcramer	704280313594302465	2016-02-29T12:21:26	IBM -what he didn't say is that the buybacks at IBM are meant to please investors like Buffett.. Is it enough?
jimcramer	704280168454561792	2016-02-29T12:20:51	IBM-not to be too ethereal but Watson is more of a metaphor. What inputs does Buffett put in it-weather, collisions? Important...$IBM

jimcramer	704271485570039809	2016-02-29T11:46:21	Is Warren following the transformation from old to new at IBM? or is he disengaged on this key pivot?
jimcramer	704271181378093056	2016-02-29T11:45:09	.jonsteinberg -Buffett never once said "cognitive businesses will grow fast enough to offset" IBM weakness 
jimcramer	704270493000572928	2016-02-29T11:42:24	IBM, nice endorsement about Watson.. but no suggestion that the company's stock isn't reflecting a turn
jimcramer	704270244462907392	2016-02-29T11:41:25	Why doesn't Buffett just say " I like the company and it is doing better than what you think?"
