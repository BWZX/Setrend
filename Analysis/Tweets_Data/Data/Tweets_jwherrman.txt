jwherrman	725113400343277568	2016-04-27T00:04:41	Kantrowitz I'm guessing there are better/cheaper/more native things than a network sports restream
jwherrman	725113182403067906	2016-04-27T00:03:49	Kantrowitz oh yeah you're right they'll pay for scarce stuff that has value to them, and they're guessing nfl might be that
jwherrman	725112837132193797	2016-04-27T00:02:26	Kantrowitz to rephrase: it may still have no place. something else live and scarce might, though! something made with twitter in mind
jwherrman	725112618969653248	2016-04-27T00:01:34	Kantrowitz seems like the expensive/ill-suited end of the possible spectrum for them

jwherrman	725108147073986560	2016-04-26T23:43:48	Kantrowitz when the definition varies by platform and has very little to do with pre-existing video producers
jwherrman	725106111641210880	2016-04-26T23:35:43	Kantrowitz so many people and places will read that as reassuring, largely because of the word "quality"

jwherrman	725053053334859776	2016-04-26T20:04:53	jeffjarvis the web backbone is 1) effectively the cms for instant, in absence of one and 2) fallback for desktop, where there‚Äôs no IA rn

jwherrman	724965101434970112	2016-04-26T14:15:24	anthonyquintano jeffjarvis mathewi martinsfp emilybell depends on how you mean. in terms of hosting content, sure. but IA does revenue
jwherrman	724964666317873152	2016-04-26T14:13:40	jeffjarvis emilybell mathewi martinsfp maybe. but i would expect social media manager types to know that!
jwherrman	724964479126097920	2016-04-26T14:12:55	jeffjarvis emilybell mathewi martinsfp but the social people who have doubts are generally representing places that‚Ä¶ haven‚Äôt i guess?

jwherrman	724964022815211520	2016-04-26T14:11:06	emilybell jeffjarvis mathewi martinsfp buy as far as *why this thing exists* it is to gather fb/mobile audience, largely with video
jwherrman	724963912370774020	2016-04-26T14:10:40	emilybell jeffjarvis mathewi martinsfp I mean, there will also be a desktop audience ‚Äî no reason to discourage that
jwherrman	724963736461647874	2016-04-26T14:09:58	emilybell jeffjarvis mathewi martinsfp but yeah, i think a lot of people looking at this on desktop are missing the point
jwherrman	724963647441784833	2016-04-26T14:09:37	emilybell jeffjarvis mathewi martinsfp site is archival but will, inevitably, get some audience of its own. so it will be visible
jwherrman	724963373448835072	2016-04-26T14:08:32	jeffjarvis mathewi martinsfp emilybell this is, openly, an effort to build a facebook audience above all else. a largely distinct one!

jwherrman	723536840196804609	2016-04-22T15:40:00	to clarify, the live api seems to allow for putting virtually any video into a "stream," including pre-recorded stuff
jwherrman	723536636462653442	2016-04-22T15:39:11	kevinroose no need, there's an api now
jwherrman	723536461077856256	2016-04-22T15:38:29	adding a more powerful time incentive on both sides would change... a lot?
jwherrman	723536167543648258	2016-04-22T15:37:19	you can just recast "uploads" as "broadcasts" and "first streams" as live events of their own. now uploads are just dumps into filtered feed
jwherrman	723535815540912128	2016-04-22T15:35:55	like... tv!
jwherrman	723535741045886977	2016-04-22T15:35:37	the other way is that facebook just captures *production* - so, some videos are actually live, others are uploaded/broadcast on a schedule
jwherrman	723535381044584448	2016-04-22T15:34:12	remember the Notify app? how it had "substations" and all that? very un-feedy, very ambitious. didn't really work but they MADE it
jwherrman	723535127683457024	2016-04-22T15:33:11	there's facebook live as a whole new layer of live, notification-centric *everything* supplementing or eventually replacing news feed
jwherrman	723535021882093568	2016-04-22T15:32:46	two ways facebook live could go that facebook would like:

jwherrman	717905779433594881	2016-04-07T02:44:10	kevinroose but for the people using uber in absence of any other work!
jwherrman	717905370488901636	2016-04-07T02:42:33	kevinroose right, and that's a plausible scenario for Uber's advertised ideal driver type
