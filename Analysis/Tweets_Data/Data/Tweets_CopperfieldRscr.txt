CopperfieldRscr	563069210218463233	2015-02-04T20:18:55	BBSI The math either works, or it doesn't. We say it doesn't. Our opinion -the bad ending delayed, but not changed - 
CopperfieldRscr	532230431085563904	2014-11-11T17:56:37	We share our 2nd report on BBSI, which we think is more powerful than 1st. Here is our OWN opinion (we're short) - 
CopperfieldRscr	532223697075974144	2014-11-11T17:29:52	AlderLaneeggs SlingBikeCoffee modestproposal1 If reading ADV correctly, they have only $210M of discretionary AUM 
CopperfieldRscr	527450512442929152	2014-10-29T13:22:56	Updated thoughts on BBSI -  We remain short with even more conviction AFTER this $80M charge &amp; "liquidity" remark
CopperfieldRscr	519504606406004736	2014-10-07T15:08:44	AlderLaneeggs herbgreenberg thank you MC. Like Waldo, playing Where is Robin has become a game in itself.
CopperfieldRscr	519504156118089728	2014-10-07T15:06:57	GPRO is not what it seems. Great product, great chart... But accounting has yet to be fleshed out well. Still working through details.
CopperfieldRscr	519503864085483520	2014-10-07T15:05:47	You see, we believe GPRO has used accounting gimmickry to overstate EBITDA by at least 10%. Very aggressive. CitronResearch
CopperfieldRscr	519503387247656960	2014-10-07T15:03:54	AlderLaneeggs herbgreenberg As to GPRO - camera is great. Accounting is interesting. We will share our thoughts soon.
CopperfieldRscr	519503196478132225	2014-10-07T15:03:08	AlderLaneeggs herbgreenberg the SODA financials were going left while the story/expectations were going right. Sad how much people lost
CopperfieldRscr	519503025304371202	2014-10-07T15:02:27	AlderLaneeggs herbgreenberg We were lambasted for our work on SODA in the 60's

CopperfieldRscr	487244590609477632	2014-07-10T14:38:57	AlderLaneeggs - SODA GM's will implode when WMT and TGT put back product to them with dated canisters/flavors that have yet to sell
CopperfieldRscr	487244307091312641	2014-07-10T14:37:50	AlderLaneeggs No offense to Whit Tilson, but "borrowing" other's work on SODA failed to mention SODA depreciates canisters over 50 yrs
CopperfieldRscr	487243824138170369	2014-07-10T14:35:54	AlderLaneeggs Ain't happening. Yonah Lloyd (face for US investors) bailed from SODA last week for Mobileye. He left for a reason...

CopperfieldRscr	431859113648070656	2014-02-07T18:36:50	herbgreenberg - to our conversation - Seems SODA already passed over (and Bevyz is PEP partner - )
CopperfieldRscr	431855818011471873	2014-02-07T18:23:45	While SODA mgmt may not "comment" - why would they shoot it down?, Indra already said "no!" to SODA rumors - 
CopperfieldRscr	431855384748253184	2014-02-07T18:22:01	PEP picks Bevyz -  NOT SODA , but why would they partner with SODA? Don't need them.
CopperfieldRscr	431854959882027008	2014-02-07T18:20:20	Sorry SODA speculators - PEP picked their partner - 
CopperfieldRscr	395636363581587456	2013-10-30T19:40:34	WWW - indeed we made an error and apologize. WWWW did make a note of the B/S reclass- we missed it &amp; have updated our thoughts accordingly
