ericbolling	718297631974363139	2016-04-08T04:41:15	They moved the Friday oreillyfactor segment to today. 
ericbolling	718294640034779136	2016-04-08T04:29:22	SS I said NY April 19 but Cruz should focus on April 26 PA, D, De etc 172 delegates.  
ericbolling	718073936123047936	2016-04-07T13:52:22	Thank you! 
ericbolling	718073373100650497	2016-04-07T13:50:07	I didn't suggest otherwise... ever. Also "in the rules" is rule 40b.. so it's down to Trump  Cruz.. I'm fine w that 
ericbolling	718073005134319616	2016-04-07T13:48:40	I'll vote for the GOP nominee, no matter whom it is.. Your non-vote is a vote needed to defeat HRC= a vote for HRC

ericbolling	718071394404204544	2016-04-07T13:42:16	True, ps I can't wait to see all those GOPe who love Cruz now abandon him &amp; push a rule 40b change to get Ryan in.  
ericbolling	718068288253603841	2016-04-07T13:29:55	How about I address a specific problem you have with my numbers.. Beware, it will hurt. (on twitter of course) 
ericbolling	718067148468269056	2016-04-07T13:25:23	Correct... still a plurality.. and a greater plurality than all other GOP candidates.  
ericbolling	718045966964813825	2016-04-07T12:01:13	I love to crunch. Chips or numbers. Thanks for the note.

ericbolling	706344665616945152	2016-03-06T05:04:26	Scott, do you honestly think the GOPe will support Ted Cruz as a nominee? They are in a corner now 2 evils, no out.

ericbolling	706337154071437314	2016-03-06T04:34:35	OMG?? Do you deny the numbers?  or so blinded by dislike, you choose to ignore them?  
ericbolling	706336836994646016	2016-03-06T04:33:19	Noted.. but I encourage discourse on this T-feed. This hatred has been challenging tho.  Blocking hate is exhausting 
ericbolling	706335256870318080	2016-03-06T04:27:02	One last tweet coming up 
ericbolling	706335032131067904	2016-03-06T04:26:09	I did.. shame so many resort to personal attacks, vulgarities. Differences of opinion = welcomed here.. oh well ;)  
ericbolling	706334443288526848	2016-03-06T04:23:48	Amazing that all this over statistical analysis.. Math is math. 
ericbolling	706334010184704000	2016-03-06T04:22:05	I promise to highlight if Cruz, Rubio or Kasich gain the momentum to take the nomination... but statistically gone 
ericbolling	706333657435389952	2016-03-06T04:20:41	Way to go genius. Stupid tweets like this get you blocked.  
ericbolling	706333208313536512	2016-03-06T04:18:54	Except for today when I congratulated Cruz on multiple occasions today. BECAUSE HE WON. By The Numbers people!

ericbolling	706332454450282496	2016-03-06T04:15:54	My whiteboard analysis said Trump gets 46% of delegates in proportional states... let's see how it did in am, deal?  
ericbolling	706330995352543232	2016-03-06T04:10:06	It's been interesting.. I'll continue to run the numbers. If you think I'm lying, or conned, so be it. Good luck with your candidate. Night
ericbolling	706330287463133184	2016-03-06T04:07:18	I'm "conned" by whom?.. who do you suspect has the numerical path to the nomination Deb?  
ericbolling	706329918452453376	2016-03-06T04:05:50	"Diss"?  I don't diss, I'm running the numbers.. They don't lie. Nor do I.

ericbolling	706325995683500034	2016-03-06T03:50:14	Let's hear YOUR scenario... Who gets to 1237 and how? Curious about your math skills  
ericbolling	706325250955481089	2016-03-06T03:47:17	No, I was incredulous when GeraldoRivera suggested KS (40 proportional delegates) going to Cruz was a game changer. 
ericbolling	706324213515177989	2016-03-06T03:43:10	DC Elites "nightmare scenario" playing out in real time. Choose between realDonaldTrump &amp; SenTedCruz . Think they're getting the message?
ericbolling	706323773650300928	2016-03-06T03:41:25	Ok By the numbers: Cruz has a slim shot (10%-15%) "IF" Rubio drops asap. Rubio Kasich no shot. Trump is likely nominee. Take the meds, night
ericbolling	706321331160272896	2016-03-06T03:31:42	Are you kidding me? I congratulated Ted Cruz twice for the "big win" in KS. You haters are ridiculous.

ericbolling	705781277073387520	2016-03-04T15:45:43	and you'd prefer to use no data?  
ericbolling	705780990841491456	2016-03-04T15:44:35	ONLY on proportional states... which is the most accurate way to use the data

ericbolling	705488138597224448	2016-03-03T20:20:54	 
ericbolling	705478580831199232	2016-03-03T19:42:55	Why hasn't realDonaldTrump disavowed Mitt Romney yet?... He must be racist.
ericbolling	705471365365760001	2016-03-03T19:14:15	To GOP who vow not to vote if Trump. That begets HRC which begets: Tax Policy Center: Hillary Clinton's plan: $1.1 trillion in tax increases
ericbolling	705464145475293184	2016-03-03T18:45:33	Fair enough.. but would you rather HRC gets the job?

ericbolling	705187552156897280	2016-03-03T00:26:28	Thank you Craig!  
ericbolling	705187148857745408	2016-03-03T00:24:52	Thanks Grace! 
ericbolling	705178536726888448	2016-03-02T23:50:39	Not all.  But certainly as many as possible.  
ericbolling	705106423001292800	2016-03-02T19:04:06	It's been.. let's just say "spirited".. I hope you check out TheFive for the 2016 math breakdown. (I know haters, save it)
ericbolling	705104841350189060	2016-03-02T18:57:49	Simple... open up a DC congressional phone book, close your eyes, point to a name.. and bingo! (with few exceptions) 
ericbolling	705103973594824705	2016-03-02T18:54:22	amen brother.  
ericbolling	705102876213977089	2016-03-02T18:50:00	Fair enough and I agree.. .. how would you suggest unseating the corrupt DC elites?  
ericbolling	705102142806347777	2016-03-02T18:47:05	Thank you Stephen... that's the goal as a "pundit". People are confusing opinion with other forms of journalism 
ericbolling	705098765468884992	2016-03-02T18:33:40	Again.. watch the rhetoric.  I simply RT'd The Hill who "broke" it.  
ericbolling	705098483657740288	2016-03-02T18:32:33	I will highlight that today...  
ericbolling	705097932060692480	2016-03-02T18:30:21	I admit I've a severe distaste for Establishment DC elites. In that vein, I prefer an "outsider". Why is that bias? 
ericbolling	705097138586456064	2016-03-02T18:27:12	Maybe you should stop doing that... you'd be more accurate going forward.  
ericbolling	705096702966022144	2016-03-02T18:25:28	Yes let's... because you are correct.  
ericbolling	705096242053980160	2016-03-02T18:23:38	Math is math Jeff. I have no "emotional" attachment to anyone besides my family and my God.  
ericbolling	705094912354754560	2016-03-02T18:18:21	It's not "my math".. it's just math.. Your dislike of Trump is clouding your ability to understand the math 
ericbolling	705093580046598147	2016-03-02T18:13:04	I will "do the math" for you on The Five..  
ericbolling	705093306838081536	2016-03-02T18:11:59	And that's perfectly within your constitutionally protected right to vote your conscience. You should no matter what 
ericbolling	705091715250692096	2016-03-02T18:05:39	I believe Trump Cruz or Rubio would beat HRC but there's only one nominee and that's statistically realDonaldTrump 
ericbolling	705088823156412416	2016-03-02T17:54:10	Look, I'm all for differences of opinion here. Keep it classy..  If it gets personal, I'll block. Life's too short 
ericbolling	705007624723546112	2016-03-02T12:31:30	Thanks EBC! Appreciate the thought, FoxNews is in good hands with Brett, Megyn and Chris.

ericbolling	704875410329378816	2016-03-02T03:46:08	My (mathematic) takeaway. Cruz feels he's only w shot to take on Trump. Rubio isn't dropping out. Therefore, path paved for Trump nomination
ericbolling	704873860336885760	2016-03-02T03:39:58	Rough time with HS math Cal?   
ericbolling	704873654144929792	2016-03-02T03:39:09	Desperate?.. no math.  
ericbolling	704873341417607168	2016-03-02T03:37:55	Delegate math deeper dive: Rubio is at 18% in TX...  If Rubio hits the 20% threshhold he will hurt Ted Cruz delegate count more than Trump.
ericbolling	704862993880842240	2016-03-02T02:56:48	You figure this out.. The Hill says yes.. others saying no.. Not that Earth shattering either way.
ericbolling	704862261093994496	2016-03-02T02:53:53	RTing a The Hill tweet.. so blocking you fool. 
ericbolling	704858055331213314	2016-03-02T02:37:10	SuperTuesday so far... Trump: AL, GA, MA, TN, VA Cruz: TX, OK Clinton: GA, VA, AL, TN, AR, TX Sanders: VT, OK 
ericbolling	704851530558603264	2016-03-02T02:11:15	FoxNews projects Cruz wins TX.. Trump second. Rubio third.
ericbolling	704842635169701888	2016-03-02T01:35:54	FoxNews now calls VA for Trump.
ericbolling	704837623416791040	2016-03-02T01:15:59	Fox projects Trump wins GA, TN, AL, MA and in OK Cruz leads Trump and Rubio by a small margin FoxNews
