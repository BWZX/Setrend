ericlonners	713863120339513348	2016-03-26T23:00:05	JWMason1 NeilLancastle Ramanan_V JoMicheII Also, growth differential in favour of US income is persistent.
ericlonners	713863038055682049	2016-03-26T22:59:45	JWMason1 NeilLancastle Ramanan_V JoMicheII I think income is reported and not proxied. Work I've seen suggests not rigged by corporates.

ericlonners	713683471974182912	2016-03-26T11:06:13	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle NathanTankus Their own measures are giving two measures with opposite sign. Back envelope is a wise cross check!
ericlonners	713682849895940097	2016-03-26T11:03:45	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle NathanTankus You shouldn't use BEA data on this issue without thinking.
ericlonners	713682710326329344	2016-03-26T11:03:12	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle NathanTankus The point is not to measure exactly - not possible. It's to understand magnitude of BEA error.
ericlonners	713680956574535680	2016-03-26T10:56:14	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle NathanTankus It usually does, particularly if income received is less risky. That's the whole issue - anomaly.
ericlonners	713680213050331136	2016-03-26T10:53:16	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle NathanTankus From memory, the BEA uses corp bond indices - need to check. Do you know?
ericlonners	713678312942538752	2016-03-26T10:45:43	NeilLancastle Ramanan_V NathanTankus I agree re the insurance point - but edge in investing also appears structural.
ericlonners	713677989809111041	2016-03-26T10:44:26	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle NathanTankus Far too hard to measure A &amp; L directly, &amp; BEA proxy totally flawed. So better to look at income.

ericlonners	713676898027569152	2016-03-26T10:40:06	NeilLancastle Ramanan_V NathanTankus Seen anything in reduction in external liabilities due to subprime defaults. Back of envelope - huge
ericlonners	713674958199595008	2016-03-26T10:32:24	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle NathanTankus Certainly more consistent with net income performance.
ericlonners	713674772664729600	2016-03-26T10:31:39	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle NathanTankus Probably more accurate!

ericlonners	713674582268502016	2016-03-26T10:30:54	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle NathanTankus Use of BEA measures is a waste of time.
ericlonners	713674299949903872	2016-03-26T10:29:47	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle NathanTankus NOT at all correctly proxied by corp bond indices etc. In fact opposite sign.
ericlonners	713674153673551872	2016-03-26T10:29:12	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle NathanTankus in official liability data. Losses huge - external 'liabilities' wiped out.
ericlonners	713674041333313536	2016-03-26T10:28:45	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle NathanTankus ie - I have just been looking at subprime-related losses by overseas banks - completely ignored
ericlonners	713673836412211201	2016-03-26T10:27:56	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle NathanTankus For sure, all I'm saying is superior trading in a assets is persistently dominating deficit.
ericlonners	713671935427784704	2016-03-26T10:20:23	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle NathanTankus but not an external liability problem at all.
ericlonners	713671882558599168	2016-03-26T10:20:10	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle NathanTankus You're right. Current a/c def is a cyclical headache for US, and a domestic balance sheet challenge
ericlonners	713671693554827265	2016-03-26T10:19:25	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle NathanTankus Will be interested in your thoughts. Written long time ago - but evidence supportive, I think.
ericlonners	713669801131028480	2016-03-26T10:11:54	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle NathanTankus  Note also, far from 'tipping point' occurring, trend accelerates.
ericlonners	713668014382706688	2016-03-26T10:04:48	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle NathanTankus That's unthinking assertion. The BEAs proxies have been flawed for decades 
ericlonners	713038297333825536	2016-03-24T16:22:32	Good reminder Ricardo thought "Ricardian Equivalence" was nonsense and Fisher didn't believe in "the Fisher effect" 
ericlonners	713503044323975170	2016-03-25T23:09:16	NeilLancastle Ramanan_V JoMicheII JWMason1 I would argue they were right about external assets but irrelevant to "imbalances" debate.
ericlonners	713502605494906880	2016-03-25T23:07:32	NeilLancastle Ramanan_V JoMicheII JWMason1 Changes in current account balance as measure of cyclical risk, is v different issue imo

ericlonners	713498408133197824	2016-03-25T22:50:51	NeilLancastle Ramanan_V JoMicheII JWMason1 They were 'right' about USD.
ericlonners	713498199009452033	2016-03-25T22:50:01	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 And it changes the sign.
ericlonners	713498148400930816	2016-03-25T22:49:49	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 No. I just think more sensible to derive net asset value from net income.
ericlonners	713498017224134656	2016-03-25T22:49:18	NeilLancastle Ramanan_V JoMicheII JWMason1 They're essentially doing same as me. But my analysis is different. I don't buy 'dark matter'
ericlonners	713492430880948225	2016-03-25T22:27:06	NeilLancastle Ramanan_V JoMicheII JWMason1 Probably wrong by a factor of 3-5.
ericlonners	713491831410057216	2016-03-25T22:24:43	NeilLancastle Ramanan_V JoMicheII JWMason1 Intel investments in Malaysia compared to local stk mkt. It's close to meaningless.
ericlonners	713491617542496258	2016-03-25T22:23:52	NeilLancastle Ramanan_V JoMicheII JWMason1 BEA uses local stock mkt to value FDI - think China. US FDI into China compared to local stks
ericlonners	713491453515800576	2016-03-25T22:23:13	NeilLancastle Ramanan_V JoMicheII JWMason1 Why? And you don't have the balance sheet. You have a terrible proxy!
ericlonners	713491100942598144	2016-03-25T22:21:49	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 But most likely case is BEA underestimating value of US external A, and overvaluing L
ericlonners	713490891588124672	2016-03-25T22:20:59	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 b) market value is lower. Latter may be case if mkt making huge valuation error.
ericlonners	713490145044000768	2016-03-25T22:18:01	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 BEA is implicitly assuming either a) income received is riskier than that paid, or ...
ericlonners	713489830517325825	2016-03-25T22:16:46	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 No it's not. I am valuing A &amp; L by discounting income.
ericlonners	713489344552681472	2016-03-25T22:14:50	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 You cannot have net liabilities if you have a less risky excess income. That is a net asset.
ericlonners	713489198939025410	2016-03-25T22:14:15	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 You're totally missing the point. BEA measured A &amp; L is nonsense. US has net assets!
ericlonners	713488786693492736	2016-03-25T22:12:37	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 Therefore net assets will rise. U extrapolating flawed methodology which repeatedly wrong!
ericlonners	713488528802463744	2016-03-25T22:11:35	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 Not at all. I am observing trend of rising net income, and think it is structural.
ericlonners	713488302079418369	2016-03-25T22:10:41	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 S&amp;P trades on 17x - do u think BoP net income more or less risky?
ericlonners	713488092779425793	2016-03-25T22:09:51	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 Not convinced. 140 chracters good discipline! Not that complex in fact.
ericlonners	713487962844041216	2016-03-25T22:09:20	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 Thats my whole point!
ericlonners	713487843377676288	2016-03-25T22:08:52	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 True value of asset is PV of cashflows. If you have cahflows and understand properties - done
ericlonners	713487492251533312	2016-03-25T22:07:28	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 US has net external assets of &gt;$2trn. Any objections to that methodology?
ericlonners	713487307341488128	2016-03-25T22:06:44	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 Opposite is true. US income received is less risky than income paid. Put net income on 14x.
ericlonners	713487157994852354	2016-03-25T22:06:09	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 US has net income. Present value is positive unless income received more volatile than paid.

ericlonners	713482279784484864	2016-03-25T21:46:46	NeilLancastle Ramanan_V JoMicheII JWMason1 btw BEA measures are nonsense - proxy value of US FDI using local stock indices! Think China
ericlonners	713482083763621888	2016-03-25T21:45:59	NeilLancastle Ramanan_V JoMicheII JWMason1 From my perspective (US has external assets) devaluation worsens external position.
ericlonners	713481758612791298	2016-03-25T21:44:41	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 Really? Look at the trend - opposite sign to forecasts.
ericlonners	713465960066207744	2016-03-25T20:41:55	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 You don't need many assumptions at all. Net income is positive.
ericlonners	713465337988194304	2016-03-25T20:39:26	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 Insurance has a negative expected return to buyer ...

ericlonners	713464872223305729	2016-03-25T20:37:35	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 Liquidty of assets is different, but US assets less risky than liabilities
ericlonners	713464439534694400	2016-03-25T20:35:52	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 Far from it ... I calculated relative volatility of income.
ericlonners	713464250468052992	2016-03-25T20:35:07	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 Hence venture capital analogy is wrong. Better analogy: Warren Buffett v German Landesbank!
ericlonners	713463898528210946	2016-03-25T20:33:43	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 If US external assets less risky (which they are) - US has accumulated huge external assets.
ericlonners	713463756421001222	2016-03-25T20:33:09	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 That's nonsense measurement! Do a DCF.
ericlonners	713463547435610113	2016-03-25T20:32:19	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 Not relevant to b/s. Key point is that US has structural edge in trading assets. Will blog.

ericlonners	713462668309430273	2016-03-25T20:28:50	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 And they've been wrong - opposite has been occurring.
ericlonners	713462196097978368	2016-03-25T20:26:57	Ramanan_V NeilLancastle JoMicheII JWMason1 It's hardly a 'tipping point' - they try to predict point at which net income goes negative
ericlonners	713461594295021569	2016-03-25T20:24:34	Ramanan_V JoMicheII JWMason1 Assets are greater than liabilities - and net income has been rising rapidly!
ericlonners	713461076545900544	2016-03-25T20:22:30	NeilLancastle Ramanan_V JoMicheII JWMason1 That looks cool - thanks Neil!

ericlonners	712049055849979906	2016-03-21T22:51:38	stf18 StephanieKelton TheStalwart M_C_Klein That's key. If Fed can do TLTROs, it can do heli drops: Perpetual TLTRO at zero rate.

ericlonners	705780156581986305	2016-03-04T15:41:16	MESandbu dsquareddigest mileskimball Fed has IORR &amp; IOER - just happen to be same number currently.

ericlonners	705778032418680832	2016-03-04T15:32:50	MESandbu dsquareddigest mileskimball There is a rate(s) aimed at influencing mkt interest rates, a penal rate for liquidity, &amp; a gift!
ericlonners	705777180865908736	2016-03-04T15:29:27	MESandbu dsquareddigest mileskimball I think we should distinguish rates by function - what we call each not relevant.
ericlonners	705775130740396033	2016-03-04T15:21:18	MESandbu mileskimball That does not make it most important, but distinguishes clearly.
ericlonners	705774928369422336	2016-03-04T15:20:30	MESandbu mileskimball There are multiple rates under control of CB. I guess 'policy rate' is that which most directly impacts money mkt r.
ericlonners	705759439819776000	2016-03-04T14:18:57	mileskimball MESandbu Bottom line: CBs need to stop generating profits and start losing net income.
ericlonners	705759321062301696	2016-03-04T14:18:29	mileskimball MESandbu Even bigger impact if reserves created remunerated at 0 or positive rates.
ericlonners	705759074374316033	2016-03-04T14:17:30	mileskimball MESandbu TLTROs at -2% and 10yr maturities would change real investment rtn calculations meaningfully
ericlonners	705758904962125824	2016-03-04T14:16:49	mileskimball MESandbu Either way, it improves corp profitability and shows what CBs can do if they are willing.
ericlonners	705758728830775296	2016-03-04T14:16:07	mileskimball MESandbu Depends if you think investment is sensitive to these kind of interest rate changes.
ericlonners	705758519937638400	2016-03-04T14:15:18	mileskimball MESandbu Effects hard to measure, of course. You would expect corporates to substitute finance for existing plans

ericlonners	705685049925083137	2016-03-04T09:23:21	Ramanan_V jomichell For example, net interest income is not determinant of asset or liability.

ericlonners	705680864869486592	2016-03-04T09:06:43	Ramanan_V Also, I seem to remember he thought the US has net external liabilities because of cumulative C/A deficits. When it has assets.
ericlonners	705680609679691776	2016-03-04T09:05:42	Ramanan_V Godley didn't really know how to treat base money - he admitted as much to me.

ericlonners	705015170771378176	2016-03-02T13:01:29	mileskimball MESandbu I think behavioural reality makes effects at minimum opaque.
ericlonners	705014901115330560	2016-03-02T13:00:25	MESandbu mileskimball Problem we are dealing with is reality of multiple real rates. Consumption theory assumes a single rate.
ericlonners	705014323740024832	2016-03-02T12:58:07	mileskimball MESandbu I observe most Europeans think of lifetime income using bond yields. So the textbook consumption model is right.
ericlonners	705013991807053824	2016-03-02T12:56:48	mileskimball MESandbu I'm not clear what you're saying Miles - wealth effect dominates lifetime income effect?

ericlonners	705012255436500992	2016-03-02T12:49:54	mileskimball MESandbu Still doughnut problem. It's an income effect. Economy has net assets, if rates fall so does lifetime income.
ericlonners	705011687624040448	2016-03-02T12:47:39	mileskimball We can't have our (theoretical) cake, and eat it. If equity prices go up (yields down) lifetime income falls.
ericlonners	705010883806830592	2016-03-02T12:44:27	MESandbu mileskimball Households have net assets. When rates fall lifetime income falls.
ericlonners	705010596660568064	2016-03-02T12:43:19	mileskimball Standard household consumption shows decline in lifetime income due to falling 'rates'. I think this is correct.
ericlonners	705010370126221312	2016-03-02T12:42:25	mileskimball MESandbu Equities *should* be going through the roof. Opposite has been happening with negative rates.

ericlonners	705010081646174208	2016-03-02T12:41:16	mileskimball MESandbu Not behaviourally. Middle class in EZ planning lifetime income sees a decline in interest income.
ericlonners	705009774354632704	2016-03-02T12:40:03	mileskimball MESandbu Agreed. And may be correct in EZ. People don't perceive changes in PV of labor income. Or PV of physical assets.
ericlonners	705009424075788288	2016-03-02T12:38:39	mileskimball MESandbu Revaluing human capital does not change lifetime income. Asset up, future income down.
ericlonners	705008865499336704	2016-03-02T12:36:26	mileskimball MESandbu If private sector has net assets, lower rates means lower lifetime income. No?

ericlonners	703282411585585152	2016-02-26T18:16:07	FlorianMKern Also, I would not be surprised if CPI stayed below target - all depends on supply response to higher demand

ericlonners	703201761012502528	2016-02-26T12:55:39	Perceptive analysis, and a letter to Tony Blair, from sjwrenlewis 
ericlonners	703199544276746241	2016-02-26T12:46:50	mileskimball I think which rate may actually be key. BoJ smart to leave rate on existing reserves unchanged.
ericlonners	703199072681725952	2016-02-26T12:44:58	mileskimball Problem is Swiss example: borrowing rates unchanged, return on government bonds down.
ericlonners	703198471830896640	2016-02-26T12:42:35	mileskimball It depends. Remember: falling rates raise desired savings through income effect.
ericlonners	703198198781771776	2016-02-26T12:41:30	mileskimball MESandbu Firms don't have reserve accounts. Also TLTROs have restrictions. Note: BoJ has in effect done what I am suggesting
ericlonners	703194929053323264	2016-02-26T12:28:30	DavidBeckworth Huge problem getting marginal cost. I also don't like the fact that Bernanke is using daily correlation.
ericlonners	703192704415617024	2016-02-26T12:19:40	DavidBeckworth My instinct is that that is way too high. In part because copper prices have collapsed.
ericlonners	703192400995422208	2016-02-26T12:18:27	DavidBeckworth We could "test" this by looking at the sector relative performance of resource and energy stocks

ericlonners	702859246426267648	2016-02-25T14:14:37	t0nyyates sjwrenlewis I still think RE makes policy *more* effective: rational to expect higher future income, not higher future taxes.
ericlonners	702858776911679488	2016-02-25T14:12:45	t0nyyates 'Animal spirits' is about individuals perceptions ('expectations') of their own circumstances.
ericlonners	702858493984968708	2016-02-25T14:11:38	t0nyyates I think there may be an endowment effect: at effectively zero inflation and v low rates money supply creates its own demand.

ericlonners	700209951428497408	2016-02-18T06:47:16	ltpetemitchell_ interfluidity dsquareddigest Idea that value (+ or -) of base money = accounting value is wrong.
ericlonners	700209670464659456	2016-02-18T06:46:09	ltpetemitchell_ interfluidity dsquareddigest All this highlights problems with accounting categories.

ericlonners	700204976715468800	2016-02-18T06:27:30	MacRoweNick interfluidity delong dsquareddigest Therefore reserves not a liability. Liabilities have negative present value.
ericlonners	700204650025349120	2016-02-18T06:26:12	MacRoweNick interfluidity delong dsquareddigest Either way, net, it would be highly valuable.
ericlonners	700204582455152644	2016-02-18T06:25:56	MacRoweNick interfluidity delong dsquareddigest Of course they could overproduce with costs, or underproduce.
ericlonners	700204471452897280	2016-02-18T06:25:29	MacRoweNick interfluidity delong dsquareddigest If reserves where created without purchasing assets, this would be valuable to the state
ericlonners	700202263667740672	2016-02-18T06:16:43	MacRoweNick interfluidity delong dsquareddigest Just selling a car you have a liability
ericlonners	700200193048891392	2016-02-18T06:08:29	MacRoweNick interfluidity delong dsquareddigest There are contingent liabilities everywhere, but this is a separate issue.
ericlonners	700199871127621633	2016-02-18T06:07:13	MacRoweNick interfluidity delong dsquareddigest The conventional balance sheet framing of this is all wrong.
ericlonners	700199732388478976	2016-02-18T06:06:39	MacRoweNick interfluidity delong dsquareddigest CBs sell liquidity services
ericlonners	700199690273431553	2016-02-18T06:06:29	MacRoweNick interfluidity delong dsquareddigest But we don't treat sales as liabilities
ericlonners	700199565841068033	2016-02-18T06:06:00	MacRoweNick interfluidity delong dsquareddigest The producer of any good or service has a liability - to provide what it promises
ericlonners	700198831535878145	2016-02-18T06:03:05	MacRoweNick interfluidity delong dsquareddigest For sure ... Benefits too, though!
ericlonners	700195429607202816	2016-02-18T05:49:34	MacRoweNick interfluidity delong dsquareddigest 2) would it pay a positive sum for this privilege? If liability, no. If asset, yes.
ericlonners	700195206981885952	2016-02-18T05:48:40	MacRoweNick interfluidity 1) If state can only create money by dropping cash from helicopter (i.e. no conventional seigniorage),
ericlonners	700193561778745345	2016-02-18T05:42:08	MacRoweNick interfluidity delong dsquareddigest Issue is not really whether or not liability, but whether 'book value' is accurate.
ericlonners	700193052581883904	2016-02-18T05:40:07	MacRoweNick interfluidity Depends on future changes in demand for base money.
ericlonners	700192885006798848	2016-02-18T05:39:27	MacRoweNick interfluidity my view: base money may be contingent liability (or asset), but if cont liability unlikely to equal book value
ericlonners	700190436401483776	2016-02-18T05:29:43	MacRoweNick interfluidity delong dsquareddigest Of course. But with that line of reasoning base money (net) is an asset.
ericlonners	700187693850951680	2016-02-18T05:18:49	MacRoweNick interfluidity delong dsquareddigest 2) None render money a liability.
ericlonners	700187490867609600	2016-02-18T05:18:01	MacRoweNick interfluidity delong dsquareddigest I remember this. 1) Accepting money for taxes, CPI targets etc are all commitments, but
ericlonners	700186513909399552	2016-02-18T05:14:08	MacRoweNick interfluidity delong dsquareddigest See 'Buffett test' - v clear reserves not liability 
ericlonners	700185870633197569	2016-02-18T05:11:35	MacRoweNick interfluidity delong dsquareddigest I was more convinced by you original position!
ericlonners	700185163708395520	2016-02-18T05:08:46	MacRoweNick interfluidity delong dsquareddigest I think u may be doing a 'Randall Wray': giving one word - 'liability' - two meanings.
ericlonners	700184317415288832	2016-02-18T05:05:24	MacRoweNick interfluidity delong dsquareddigest Let's say CB targets trend real growth not CPI.
ericlonners	700183586335551488	2016-02-18T05:02:30	MacRoweNick interfluidity delong dsquareddigest So having an inflation target makes money a liability - v odd def of 'liability'!

ericlonners	699877609342177280	2016-02-17T08:46:39	tymoignee wonkmonk_ delong I'm at the EU parliament today to argue the ECB shld make infinite maturity zero coupon loans to households!

ericlonners	699727340365070336	2016-02-16T22:49:32	tymoignee wonkmonk_ yvessmith delong You've created a new 'bond' which doesn't mature or pay a coupon (i.e. which is not a bond!)

ericlonners	699724615623565312	2016-02-16T22:38:43	tymoignee wonkmonk_ yvessmith ProfSteveKeen delong See post: function, &amp; basis of value of money &amp; debt totally distinct. V clear.

ericlonners	699720730766921732	2016-02-16T22:23:17	tymoignee wonkmonk_ yvessmith ProfSteveKeen delong Why should it? We use dollar bills to buy things - not to receive cashflows.
ericlonners	699720420065460226	2016-02-16T22:22:02	tymoignee wonkmonk_ yvessmith ProfSteveKeen delong Default has clear meaning. And it does not apply to dollar bills.

ericlonners	699716336767909888	2016-02-16T22:05:49	tymoignee wonkmonk_ yvessmith ProfSteveKeen delong Eric, it's v simple: default = miss a payment. Govt can't miss payment on $10 bill.

ericlonners	699714737219760128	2016-02-16T21:59:28	tymoignee wonkmonk_ yvessmith ProfSteveKeen delong Govt can break lots promises. Money carries no intrinsic promise to make a payment.
ericlonners	699714472957628416	2016-02-16T21:58:25	tymoignee wonkmonk_ yvessmith ProfSteveKeen delong No. That's removing convertibility. A. Default = miss payment
ericlonners	699714056916242433	2016-02-16T21:56:45	tymoignee wonkmonk_ yvessmith ProfSteveKeen delong default does not equal refuse payment
ericlonners	699713757153468421	2016-02-16T21:55:34	tymoignee wonkmonk_ yvessmith ProfSteveKeen delong To refuse currency in payment of taxes = refusing payment
ericlonners	699713664300027905	2016-02-16T21:55:12	tymoignee wonkmonk_ yvessmith ProfSteveKeen delong Randall uses 'default' metaphorically.
ericlonners	699713543353065474	2016-02-16T21:54:43	tymoignee wonkmonk_ yvessmith ProfSteveKeen delong You have changed A - you can't do that! Default = miss a payment.

ericlonners	693922263016607744	2016-01-31T22:22:14	AnuarUshbayev tymoignee stf18 Fair point. Here's a question: why can't Greece fix its yield curve?
ericlonners	693921778289283072	2016-01-31T22:20:19	tymoignee stf18 AnuarUshbayev Sure, all one sided.

ericlonners	693920535349235714	2016-01-31T22:15:22	tymoignee AnuarUshbayev stf18 Key point though: central bank can determine stock of base money without closing any markets.

ericlonners	693917857185415168	2016-01-31T22:04:44	tymoignee stf18 AnuarUshbayev My point is: 1) government can fix any price, but will eliminate liquidity (ie there'll be no market)

ericlonners	693913508031889408	2016-01-31T21:47:27	stf18 tymoignee AnuarUshbayev Prior points remain valid. If price too low, private sector will all be buyers, then no liquidity.

ericlonners	693880302494687232	2016-01-31T19:35:30	1954swilliamson farmerrf dandolfa ProfSteveKeen value of money resides in network externality. Value of debt resides in ability to repay

ericlonners	693877903197630464	2016-01-31T19:25:58	1954swilliamson farmerrf dandolfa ProfSteveKeen Other key point: CB can buy things using reserves regardless of system demand.
ericlonners	693877586972254212	2016-01-31T19:24:43	1954swilliamson farmerrf dandolfa ProfSteveKeen If Fed wants. It could adds reserves. Key point: base money not liability, not debt

ericlonners	693849595361824769	2016-01-31T17:33:29	1954swilliamson farmerrf dandolfa ProfSteveKeen 3) key point: reserves means of payment, bonds not. Greece can issue bonds.
ericlonners	693849477896093696	2016-01-31T17:33:01	1954swilliamson farmerrf dandolfa ProfSteveKeen 2) CB can raise req reserves, or increase stock of 'excess'.
ericlonners	693849359105048576	2016-01-31T17:32:32	1954swilliamson farmerrf dandolfa ProfSteveKeen 1) although, in theory, banks cld reduce their req res by shrinking balance sheet

ericlonners	693848584136081408	2016-01-31T17:29:28	1954swilliamson farmerrf dandolfa ProfSteveKeen U mean - bank can reduce its required reserves? True.

ericlonners	693841169697087489	2016-01-31T17:00:00	farmerrf dandolfa ProfSteveKeen We must be talking at cross purposes. Stock of excess reserves is determined by CB, no?

ericlonners	693840593613668353	2016-01-31T16:57:43	DanMKervick dandolfa ProfSteveKeen hugely important. Ability create reserve at any price &amp; quantity is why gov can create demand at will.
ericlonners	693840191321153536	2016-01-31T16:56:07	farmerrf dandolfa ProfSteveKeen I'll agree some degree of continuum. But extremes highlight difference - ie 30yr &amp; reserves.
ericlonners	693839696116473857	2016-01-31T16:54:09	farmerrf dandolfa ProfSteveKeen True that bills predominantly priced by rate expectations, so to some extent govt determines p &amp; q too

ericlonners	689045058419593216	2016-01-18T11:21:58	Gilesyb The standard problem with monetarism is 'which monetary aggregate'? Sumner sidesteps this with 'expectations' ...
ericlonners	689044590062604288	2016-01-18T11:20:06	Gilesyb Until then, 'expectations' can't be manipulated. Jury's still out in Japan, of course - but he's having a go!
ericlonners	689044390396981248	2016-01-18T11:19:19	Gilesyb Agreed. I don't think anyone really believes that CBs have control of CPI now, so it's a question of 'show me'.
ericlonners	689012459215130624	2016-01-18T09:12:26	Gilesyb in order to be able to convince people that you can generate inflation you have to able to do it if they don't believe you!
ericlonners	689009407724769280	2016-01-18T09:00:18	Gilesyb Expectations seems to be his weakness. He subscribes to the magic wand - expectations are neither clear nor formed as he suggests
ericlonners	689004610313392128	2016-01-18T08:41:14	Gilesyb This is v good - particularly recognition of network externality. Rarely acknowledged - but defining. 
ericlonners	688999278065397760	2016-01-18T08:20:03	Gilesyb Is it 'monetary lessons from (not so) Great Recession?'
ericlonners	688998571794927616	2016-01-18T08:17:15	Gilesyb I'll give it a go. Thanks!
ericlonners	688995295473053696	2016-01-18T08:04:14	Gilesyb Nothing to do with CB determination - quite reverse: EM CBs don't want the inflation? So why does CPI do opposite of what CBs want?
ericlonners	688995057140105217	2016-01-18T08:03:17	Gilesyb and DM CPI apparently so intransigently low?
ericlonners	688994925447368704	2016-01-18T08:02:45	Gilesyb Draghi saying - I'll provide stimulus until inflation hits target. Interesting Q for both 'schools' - why is EM CPI easy to create?
ericlonners	688994407333384192	2016-01-18T08:00:42	Gilesyb where can I get it? I've been meaning to get up to speed on Sumner. We can discuss after!
ericlonners	688993090582016000	2016-01-18T07:55:28	infotranecon Acknowledging eclecticism forces more rigour.
ericlonners	688992959019225088	2016-01-18T07:54:56	infotranecon Great post. I agree that regime-dependence is never explicit - because advocates don't acknowledge - they claim universality
ericlonners	688990894683475969	2016-01-18T07:46:44	Gilesyb Is Kuroda doing anything more than Bernanke or Draghi would do in his situation? I can't really see a philosophical difference.
ericlonners	688988130939138048	2016-01-18T07:35:45	Gilesyb But doesn't Friedman argue that we should just accept recessions - really severe ones can be avoided ... ?
ericlonners	688987664654049280	2016-01-18T07:33:54	Gilesyb as Friedman argues in AER.
ericlonners	688987563852480512	2016-01-18T07:33:30	Gilesyb I agree that it has mattered - and QE would have changed EZ if done in 2008/9. But from here conventional mon pol little effect.
ericlonners	688987276899143680	2016-01-18T07:32:22	Gilesyb to be clear - I would not have great hopes for conventional mon pol, in US, EZ or Japan if we got hit by a recession now.
ericlonners	688985048629030912	2016-01-18T07:23:30	Gilesyb Also I would worry about Friedman's critique of QE if I was Kuroda - he is not changing net wealth of private sector.
ericlonners	688984387313135617	2016-01-18T07:20:53	Gilesyb although no real evidence of expectations shifting in wage-setting
ericlonners	688984094227693568	2016-01-18T07:19:43	Gilesyb Kuroda has seemed quite determined. And evidence looks quite good so far.
ericlonners	688983908415877122	2016-01-18T07:18:59	Gilesyb I have some sympathy with that.
ericlonners	688983739758673920	2016-01-18T07:18:18	Gilesyb Is your point that you can just keep on doing QE and if you have a target that may shift beliefs?
ericlonners	688983397528633344	2016-01-18T07:16:57	Gilesyb I'm not a fan of 'eternal Keynesian verities', but banking panic disaster for demand.
ericlonners	688983169715015680	2016-01-18T07:16:03	Gilesyb And Friedman argues that OMO have no effect in liquidity trap.
ericlonners	688982975728496640	2016-01-18T07:15:16	Gilesyb I don't see why he pulled out his hair, because 2 of those assertions Friedman argued.

ericlonners	688823422017794048	2016-01-17T20:41:16	Gilesyb Is Sumner the monetarist version of Althusser (the Marxist who admitted he had barely read any Marx)?
ericlonners	688822019849371649	2016-01-17T20:35:41	Gilesyb Friedman v clearly believed 1 &amp; 3. He advocated cash transfers at zero bound - which CBs can't do under current rules
ericlonners	688821485847343109	2016-01-17T20:33:34	Gilesyb 3. Conventional monetary policy - absent new tools, such as cash transfers - is near-impotent now.
ericlonners	688821032241770496	2016-01-17T20:31:46	Gilesyb 2. Is incoherent: the quantity of base money determines its price; 'easy money' doesn't really mean anything.
ericlonners	688820614715564032	2016-01-17T20:30:06	Gilesyb 1. Is clearly true - and firmly believed by Friedman. Which is why he believe deposit insurance the most important financial reform

ericlonners	688050723720957952	2016-01-15T17:30:50	AuburnParks If you have a $10 bill no one owes anyone anything and there can't be a default. It's a  straightforward &amp; huge difference.
