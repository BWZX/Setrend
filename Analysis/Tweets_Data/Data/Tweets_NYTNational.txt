NYTNational	725367026676420609	2016-04-27T16:52:30	Dennis Hastert, former Speaker of the House, is sitting motionless as he is sentenced to 15 months in federal prison.
NYTNational	725367224324743168	2016-04-27T16:53:17	15 month sentence for Hastert is higher than prosecutors recommended as part of a plea deal using federal sentencing guidelines.
NYTNational	725366814574829569	2016-04-27T16:51:39	Dennis Hastert, former House speaker, sentenced to 15 months in prison. He is also fined $250,000. Also, two years of supervised release.
NYTNational	725366047180775426	2016-04-27T16:48:36	Judge: "There are no guarantees that the defendant won't get sicker in prison. There are no guarantees that he won't get sicker at home."
NYTNational	725366225535139845	2016-04-27T16:49:19	Here we go. Judge: "The defense wants me to impose a sentence of probation. Any sentence of straight probation would be inappropriate."
NYTNational	725366191225724928	2016-04-27T16:49:11	Judge says probation is NOT appropriate for Hastert
NYTNational	725365616954216449	2016-04-27T16:46:54	Judge says Dennis Hastert's health "needs can be met" in prison. He still hasn't delivered final sentence.
NYTNational	725365888849969152	2016-04-27T16:47:59	Judge indicates that Hastert sought a letter of support from Tom Cross, the former Repub leader whose brother was abused by Hastert
NYTNational	725365844109328384	2016-04-27T16:47:48	Judge: I spoke to the warden of a BoP facility, who assured me that "the defendant's health needs will be met if he is incarcerated."
NYTNational	725365612080431111	2016-04-27T16:46:53	Judge, who has not yet said whether Hastert will serve prison time, says that BoP is well equipped to care for inmates with health issues.
NYTNational	725365156520271872	2016-04-27T16:45:04	Also interesting that brother of Judge -- Thomas Durkin -- is the brother of another key Repub IL lawmaker, Jim Durkin.
NYTNational	725364895034839042	2016-04-27T16:44:02	Must know that Scott Cross, former wrestler who told of abuse by Hastert, is brother of Tom Cross, former IL R leader and ally of Hastert.
NYTNational	725364711349469184	2016-04-27T16:43:18	Judge reminds courtroom again of extraordinary fact: Hastert called Tom Cross, brother of one of his abuse victims, asking for his support.
NYTNational	725364089057361930	2016-04-27T16:40:50	Judge: "Sentencing an elderly person to jail can be especially hard."
NYTNational	725364377113653248	2016-04-27T16:41:58	Yes, Hastert is 74, says the judge. But "he’s not an infirm, helpless, handicapped senior citizen who is unaware of what’s going on."
NYTNational	725364387813462017	2016-04-27T16:42:01	Judge: Hastert is not infirm, unaware. Says he called Scott Cross's brother -- Republican IL former House leader Tom Cross -- for support.
NYTNational	725363777869348864	2016-04-27T16:39:35	Judge, on Hastert: "If there’s a public shaming of the defendant because of the conduct he’s engaged in, so be it."
NYTNational	725363490819559428	2016-04-27T16:38:27	Judge, praising Scott Cross for testifying on Hastert's sexual abuse: "I believe everything Mr. Cross said."
NYTNational	725363250855026688	2016-04-27T16:37:30	Judge gives passionate, lengthy comments on how victims were vulnerable, damaged for years, abused by authority.
NYTNational	725363003365937154	2016-04-27T16:36:31	Judge to Hastert: Any sentence I give you today would "pale" to what you would have received in state court for committing sexual abuse.
NYTNational	725362740928364544	2016-04-27T16:35:28	Judge tells Hastert that he is especially aggravated that someone with Hastert's education and background would commit these crimes.
NYTNational	725362692622553090	2016-04-27T16:35:17	Judge Durkin: "It breaks my heart because many of these defendants didn't have a chance."
NYTNational	725362509331468288	2016-04-27T16:34:33	Judge: "The obvious motive for your lies isn't lost on me." If this had come out, the judge says, you never would have been Speaker.

NYTNational	725362188345577473	2016-04-27T16:33:16	Judge painstakingly describes sex abuse against 14-year-old Individual A. "There's nothing ambiguous. That was sex abuse."

NYTNational	725361966487879680	2016-04-27T16:32:24	Judge rejects suggestion that sex abuse against Individual A was somehow ambiguous.

NYTNational	725361330157436928	2016-04-27T16:29:52	"Nothing is more stunning than having 'serial child molester' and 'Speaker of the House' in the same sentence." -- Judge tells Hastert
NYTNational	725361062741155841	2016-04-27T16:28:48	"It's unquestioned that he's done good for people." Judge says of Hastert, noting "irony" that some who wrote letters were wrestlers.

NYTNational	725359759050838016	2016-04-27T16:23:37	Federal judge says Hastert manipulated FBI, lied about abusing other victims.
NYTNational	725359190781341697	2016-04-27T16:21:22	Judge says Hastert's lying to the FBI was "deplorable," especially "by a person who knew better."
NYTNational	725359622903713792	2016-04-27T16:23:05	Judge says that typically, structuring violations result in little to no prison time. "This case is different from those cases," he said.
