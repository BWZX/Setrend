BrattleStCap	691704220391751680	2016-01-25T19:28:32	Valuetrap13 ActusSecundus i'm happy to, but my point is that taking up your EBIT margin assumptions will likely approximate current price

BrattleStCap	691692268059758592	2016-01-25T18:41:02	Valuetrap13 all in - 9% as a blended EBIT margin estimate is too low. It will be in the low double digits - higher if AWS dominates

BrattleStCap	691691943764561921	2016-01-25T18:39:45	Valuetrap13 for AWS - last Q, AWS printed 25% operating margin (up from 8.4% a year ago) and was 50% of this quarter’s EBIT
BrattleStCap	691691880539668480	2016-01-25T18:39:29	Valuetrap13 Amazon has no retail footprint, way more efficient distribution, and 3P is a higher-margin operation than traditional
