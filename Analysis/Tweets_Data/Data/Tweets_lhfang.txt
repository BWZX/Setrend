lhfang	691501671487242241	2016-01-25T06:03:40	SilpaKov A commission, btw, that can only make recommendations. No actual tax and spending powers. Read the bill it's weak as hell.
lhfang	691501502385504257	2016-01-25T06:03:00	SilpaKov Your "bolder vision" = a commission lol
lhfang	691500895285166080	2016-01-25T06:00:35	SilpaKov Yes, and out of all the candidates, Bernie has the boldest plan to ameliorate racial economic injustice. But he gets attacked?
lhfang	691500511032393728	2016-01-25T05:59:03	SilpaKov I just dont care about political terms like reparations. Bush called himself a peacemaker. Why do you care so much about rhetoric?

lhfang	691499437336739840	2016-01-25T05:54:47	SilpaKov If TNC would rather have Bernie support a feckless commission instead of a multi-trillion wealth transfer, lol, that's sad.
lhfang	691499060927291392	2016-01-25T05:53:18	SilpaKov I mean seriously read this bill. It does nothing: 
lhfang	691498564598566912	2016-01-25T05:51:19	SilpaKov This isn't policy! This is a call for a commission to study the issue. Its a political bill, not a policy bill.
lhfang	691497129894871040	2016-01-25T05:45:37	SilpaKov link?
lhfang	691495726669504516	2016-01-25T05:40:03	SilpaKov If you can't define reparations, this is just a political football, not policy.
lhfang	691493574970576896	2016-01-25T05:31:30	SilpaKov Kind of pointless to argue about "reparations" if you won't define what you or TNC mean by that, right?
lhfang	691491486689529856	2016-01-25T05:23:12	SilpaKov If TNC is asking for something different policywise, he hasn't detailed it or even attempted to explain it. Thus he's disingenuous
lhfang	691491282787680257	2016-01-25T05:22:23	SilpaKov Ok last comment: We've established Sanders' policies amount to reparations. So what is TNC asking for? Not policy: symbolism.
lhfang	691487849749831680	2016-01-25T05:08:45	SilpaKov EricLevitz He's never spelled out how that would work. If he did, it would probably look a lot like the policies he's criticizing
lhfang	691485681496035328	2016-01-25T05:00:08	SilpaKov EricLevitz And again, whats the great, radical solution TNC is proposing? There are none, just targeted mudslinging.
lhfang	691485458489053184	2016-01-25T04:59:15	SilpaKov EricLevitz Again, TNC claims Sanders' ideas are mainstream D ideas for generation. That's bs. We've had 30 yrs of neoliberalism.

lhfang	691479542154825729	2016-01-25T04:35:44	SilpaKov EricLevitz Given wealth distribution in US, taxing rich to help poor is defacto reparations w/high levels of public support.
lhfang	691477824566337536	2016-01-25T04:28:55	SilpaKov EricLevitz So forget about poor whites? I dont really see where you're going with this.
lhfang	691475201352142849	2016-01-25T04:18:29	SilpaKov EricLevitz Will anything solve for it entirely?
lhfang	691474142772748288	2016-01-25T04:14:17	SilpaKov EricLevitz No. Universal programs based on progressive taxation will help reduce the racial wealth gap.
