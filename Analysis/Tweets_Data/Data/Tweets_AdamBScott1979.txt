AdamBScott1979	683521221305090048	2016-01-03T05:32:13	MarkYusko IMO there are simply too many setup for that trade for it to work out.
AdamBScott1979	683519927664312321	2016-01-03T05:27:04	MarkYusko (4) Market's not going to wait for supply/demand to come back into balance before price moves. Just need positive signals..
AdamBScott1979	683519773880156160	2016-01-03T05:26:27	MarkYusko (3) There is a strong narrative out there that wants oil low… So much CAPEX being cut, future prod growth in serious jeopardy.
AdamBScott1979	683519517360717828	2016-01-03T05:25:26	MarkYusko (2) First sign of USD weakening likely sparks some short covering. And I think demand (and demand growth) being underestimated.

AdamBScott1979	683511291852357632	2016-01-03T04:52:45	MarkYusko Point of QE was to push rates down. They're still down.
