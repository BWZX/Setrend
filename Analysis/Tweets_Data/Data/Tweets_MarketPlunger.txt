MarketPlunger	717863045737934848	2016-04-06T23:54:22	RudyHavenstein MarketWatch what about if you bought in March 08?
MarketPlunger	717849029535801345	2016-04-06T22:58:40	DGonsch lol without a doubt.
MarketPlunger	717848112077926400	2016-04-06T22:55:01	LOL Damn that was a close call 
MarketPlunger	717847154446966785	2016-04-06T22:51:13	Death by pool heater exhaust leak would've really pissed me off.
MarketPlunger	717846815857623041	2016-04-06T22:49:52	Moral of the story. Go buy a CO detector. My house could've killed me or the animals at the very least if it would've gone on another week
MarketPlunger	717846278500192257	2016-04-06T22:47:44	katkars10 Thank you. My pleasure. I figured it was a good thing to share so people can see how important those CO detectors are.
MarketPlunger	717844686090670080	2016-04-06T22:41:24	katkars10 That CO detector is the best $40 I've ever spent
MarketPlunger	717844259601321984	2016-04-06T22:39:43	katkars10 It was only about 35ppm on the 3rd floor so I took the detector to the basement and it was reading above 200ppm
MarketPlunger	717844050678845442	2016-04-06T22:38:53	katkars10 Very lucky. Well oddly enough the first thing was the smell I noticed early in this morning. Then the CO detector went off.
MarketPlunger	717843361806295042	2016-04-06T22:36:08	theKanterman It's all good now. Everything back to normal. Thanks
MarketPlunger	717843136278577152	2016-04-06T22:35:15	JakeRaden lol no doubt. It was pretty scary. I'm just glad I have a CO detector or I wouldnt have known until the cats &amp; dogs started dying
MarketPlunger	717842589479735297	2016-04-06T22:33:04	JakeRaden The rest of the house has solar just not the pool heater. After this I think it's time to switch it over.
MarketPlunger	717842304426500097	2016-04-06T22:31:56	JakeRaden Probably should one of these days
MarketPlunger	717841700446683137	2016-04-06T22:29:32	katkars10 I did. I got someone out here immediately to find the problem and fix it. Levels are back to 0 now.
MarketPlunger	717841453796470784	2016-04-06T22:28:34	IvanTheK I'm glad I had one of those things. I wouldn't have known about it until the dogs and cats were dead.
MarketPlunger	717841252146876416	2016-04-06T22:27:46	IvanTheK Yup. It's on the 3rd floor. Was only averaging about 50 up there
MarketPlunger	717840809194872832	2016-04-06T22:26:00	My house tried to kill me today. CO level was at 225 ppm in the basement. It was at 1100ppm at the leak in pool heater exhaust pipe. lol

MarketPlunger	709067359449960448	2016-03-13T17:23:26	So the cops never said shutdown the rally? Trump is crafty. I bet he shut it down so he could say protesters took away his right to speak
MarketPlunger	709058630348316673	2016-03-13T16:48:45	It's great example of how poorly informed many voters are. All a candidate has to do is say something and these folks believe it.
