noamscheiber	694557933531709440	2016-02-02T16:28:10	Just one reality check on Rubio: he's not moderate by any stretch. He wants to cut taxes on rich people by more than *any* other candidate.

noamscheiber	693150517556457472	2016-01-29T19:15:36	JonathanMcFall but remember that labor vote is much more diverse than early 80s. so easier for reagan than would be for GOPer today.
noamscheiber	693150283103232000	2016-01-29T19:14:40	JonathanMcFall right, that's very high. if trump were the nominee and got that kind of percentage, he'd on his way.

noamscheiber	689828097630154753	2016-01-20T15:13:29	ThePlumLineGS jbouie i don't either. all we can say is what it looks like, and it sure as hell looks like panic.
noamscheiber	689827806721609728	2016-01-20T15:12:20	ThePlumLineGS jbouie really? you're invoking the clinton campaign as the source of the baseline expectations here?
noamscheiber	689827652824268802	2016-01-20T15:11:43	ThePlumLineGS jbouie no one's saying she's out of bounds! its perfectly legitimate. i'm not making a moral point, i'm making a tactical pt
noamscheiber	689827079211233281	2016-01-20T15:09:26	ThePlumLineGS jbouie you may have been uniquely prophetic, but let's not pretend this was the prevailing wisdom at the time.

noamscheiber	689823775752265728	2016-01-20T14:56:19	jbouie If this is such a costless tactic, why do you think they waited till under two weeks to go to unleash it?
noamscheiber	689823011583557632	2016-01-20T14:53:16	Put it this way: How confident do u feel in a campaign that began w/huge advntges &amp; now has to resort to "other guy wld bring catastrophe"?
noamscheiber	689821899845545986	2016-01-20T14:48:51	ThePlumLineGS i'm not saying it's illegitimate. just looks like they're flailing to suddenly freak out about it.
noamscheiber	689820521798610944	2016-01-20T14:43:23	jbouie people tend to resort to fear-mongering about their opponents when they're not confident in what they're selling.
