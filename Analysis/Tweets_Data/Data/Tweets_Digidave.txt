Digidave	726204607148396544	2016-04-30T00:20:45	mugwump2 I guess I'm wondering if we are amping up our rhetoric a bit as others did towards Obama. And if that helps Trump.
Digidave	726202299157114880	2016-04-30T00:11:34	downdb Part of this I'm playing devil's advocate (obviously). But: How did liberals feel about the Wright attacks? Bad faith, right?
Digidave	726202103232757760	2016-04-30T00:10:48	downdb Obama was criticized for Jeremiah Wright speeches. Trump for RTs. Not saying Trump is excused. But these critiques R of similar tone
Digidave	726171579634216960	2016-04-29T22:09:30	This tactic against Trump can also be seen as bad faith. This is related to the smugness of liberal America 
Digidave	726171472792678400	2016-04-29T22:09:05	Fear mongering against Obama was a tactic in bad faith. Supporters came to his defense stronger and accused attackers as bad faith actors
Digidave	726171254764396544	2016-04-29T22:08:13	But as I would say about Obama. There will continue to be a peaceful transfer of power every 4-8 yrs. This president won't change that.
Digidave	726171149525094400	2016-04-29T22:07:48	Now all those who defended Obama are using similar rhetoric directed at Trump. It's not that I like Trump. Far from it.
