craig_forex	687607596052656129	2016-01-14T12:10:00	BoE - notable that wage growth seemed to dip in recent data, domestic cost growth likely to increase over time.
craig_forex	687607359833702401	2016-01-14T12:09:04	BoE - expects slightly weaker growth in Q4 of 0.5% than forecast in November.
craig_forex	687607093772222464	2016-01-14T12:08:00	BoE - recent volatility in financial markets underlines downside risks to global growth.
craig_forex	687606944106819584	2016-01-14T12:07:25	BoE - oil price fall should, in time, provide support for spending in the UK and among trading partners.
craig_forex	687606754616541185	2016-01-14T12:06:40	BoE - Recent depreciation of GBP, if sustained, would lessen drag on CPI from past appreciation to some degree - EURGBP key here I think
craig_forex	687606505957273605	2016-01-14T12:05:40	BoE - unclear if more restrained outlook for near-term growth to reduce inflation pressure.
craig_forex	687606201291386880	2016-01-14T12:04:28	BoE minutes - outlook similar to Nov inflation report. Oil price fall mean near-term inflation to rise slightly more gradually than forecast
