Andy	685131789300592640	2016-01-07T16:12:02	@a_lo_in_buffalo there are countless stories online about his ignoring of aids. here is a taste 
Andy	685119208544432128	2016-01-07T15:22:02	@a_lo_in_buffalo on this we disagree. he did not pour billions into aids research. George W Bush did many years later though.
Andy	685119018206904320	2016-01-07T15:21:17	Randy_Haas no clue. it comes out three weeks after the live data. most networks have switched to it.
Andy	685111168516644864	2016-01-07T14:50:05	@a_lo_in_buffalo just googled it -- you're right! He did.  Now look at what he did as president with AIDS. I think we're both right.
Andy	685109846971158529	2016-01-07T14:44:50	@a_lo_in_buffalo on what issue did Reagan stand with the gays?
Andy	684991582534266880	2016-01-07T06:54:54	Camdam2000 mkbinla he turned his back on gays/AIDS so we will disagree on him

Andy	684863610905079808	2016-01-06T22:26:23	Women4Trump yes was he convicted? Is he running for President?
Andy	684861167643312128	2016-01-06T22:16:41	mflynny Rebecca_Duell I'm an idiot to be trying to try to have a rational conversation with a Trump supporter
Andy	684857667995734017	2016-01-06T22:02:46	CarleyCrittoure My research indicates that Bill Clinton was a great president, and isn't running for president now.
Andy	684857433664163841	2016-01-06T22:01:50	LeftyBollocks I believe he was never convicted, was a great president, &amp; isn't running for president. and that Trump is a lying cheater.
Andy	684857091333459969	2016-01-06T22:00:29	anniebeans59 mflynny then we both know how the other feels! :-)
Andy	684854904222003201	2016-01-06T21:51:47	LeftyBollocks I wasn't aware Bill Clinton had been found guilty of rape.
