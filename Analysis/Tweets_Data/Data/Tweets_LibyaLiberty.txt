LibyaLiberty	726038606045913088	2016-04-29T13:21:07	Youronlymisha because they're two different subjects. Discrimination in US is happening regardless of what's happening in Syria &amp; Iraq.

LibyaLiberty	725942656925233152	2016-04-29T06:59:51	Youronlymisha so for the last time, can you confirm what you meant by NOT fighting US discrimination while Saudi Arabia has rights issues?

LibyaLiberty	725571036306112512	2016-04-28T06:23:10	ChemistInvestor because only in your wildest dreams do these outcomes being a nation peace. 
LibyaLiberty	725570484100800512	2016-04-28T06:20:58	ChemistInvestor I disagree. 
LibyaLiberty	725569180750204929	2016-04-28T06:15:47	ChemistInvestor (and no doubt we will have it again - because it will come up again)
LibyaLiberty	725569034050220032	2016-04-28T06:15:12	ChemistInvestor ok gotta scram - thanks for a great debate. 👉🏼👇🏽☝🏾👐🏻
LibyaLiberty	725568735940087808	2016-04-28T06:14:01	ChemistInvestor than you choose to prioritize an individual over a country. That's esteem Gaddafi enjoyed. I can't do that. Many won't.
LibyaLiberty	725567557353246720	2016-04-28T06:09:20	ChemistInvestor because the alternative is Libya becomes Syria. With thousands of our precious citizens dead,&amp; a humanitarian crisis.
LibyaLiberty	725567142943416320	2016-04-28T06:07:41	ChemistInvestor ok, so support a unity gov that gets us back on a democratic path so people can choose their leaders again.
LibyaLiberty	725566477236056064	2016-04-28T06:05:03	ChemistInvestor the int'l response to NOC east oil sales is more tough luck for him -w/o his own state, his national goals are out of reach
LibyaLiberty	725566072607391745	2016-04-28T06:03:26	ChemistInvestor so how can we get back to elections, back to democracy? It's not through partition (2 NOCs etc) &amp; not through war.
LibyaLiberty	725565858395873280	2016-04-28T06:02:35	ChemistInvestor yeah I'm not anti karama!im anti civil war and Haftar is determined to make sure we have that.
LibyaLiberty	725565720784977920	2016-04-28T06:02:02	ChemistInvestor especially when their idea of solution is kill kill kill kill kill kill until they rule the country.
LibyaLiberty	725565576068870144	2016-04-28T06:01:28	ChemistInvestor we don't want Haftar-guess what, that's our right. After Gaddafi it's our responsibility to be critical of military leaders
LibyaLiberty	725565364051054592	2016-04-28T06:00:37	ChemistInvestor and isn't that the problem? Thinking any single region has the right to determine what's good for all Libyans?
LibyaLiberty	725565248145612800	2016-04-28T06:00:10	ChemistInvestor it seems you have more trust in the choices of a few Libyans - rather than trusting Libyans.
LibyaLiberty	725565010655776768	2016-04-28T05:59:13	ChemistInvestor but it's not a national army if it's fighting other Libyans.
LibyaLiberty	725564900123271168	2016-04-28T05:58:47	ChemistInvestor I agree - we need a strong army and karama is a vital foundation for that.
LibyaLiberty	725563743258697728	2016-04-28T05:54:11	ChemistInvestor just like we can't get rid of militias, we can't get rid of Haftar. Anyone w/a gun who answers to no one, is a problem.
LibyaLiberty	725563441797292032	2016-04-28T05:52:59	ChemistInvestor We didn't vote for Haftar and there's no way to vote him out - so he's a military dictator.
LibyaLiberty	725563234917453824	2016-04-28T05:52:10	ChemistInvestor hate mb, fine - but don't idolize their enemies either. Stay critical and think in real, cause effect terms.
LibyaLiberty	725562999591817216	2016-04-28T05:51:14	ChemistInvestor when you think your side is a virtuous uncorrupt military force that kills for good &amp; isn't subject to any criticism...
LibyaLiberty	725562761175031808	2016-04-28T05:50:17	ChemistInvestor again, just because you believe a military dictator is the solution, others don't agree &amp; will actively seek alternatives.
LibyaLiberty	725562544497250304	2016-04-28T05:49:25	ChemistInvestor even if that were true, it isn't an excuse to burn down the rest of Libya. It's doing the same thing, in fact.
LibyaLiberty	725562353840955392	2016-04-28T05:48:40	ChemistInvestor karama supporters MUST be honest &amp; critical of their leaders,fajr supporters the same. Otherwise we are all just sheep.
LibyaLiberty	725562161066565632	2016-04-28T05:47:54	ChemistInvestor simplifying and ignoring history to feel good about your side will only serve short term goal. Be critical of everyone.
LibyaLiberty	725561894237552641	2016-04-28T05:46:50	ChemistInvestor if you think the damage that was done,including breakdown in society, was worth war on MB(they're still here)can't help u..
LibyaLiberty	725561582802051072	2016-04-28T05:45:36	ChemistInvestor feel free to review all his statements about why he was launching war. No mention of ISIS.
LibyaLiberty	725561400920256512	2016-04-28T05:44:52	ChemistInvestor he began his war against MB &amp; Libyan militias competing for power. Isis came later-they're attracted to war &amp; chaos.
LibyaLiberty	725561108904468480	2016-04-28T05:43:43	oldmommatajuri lol -ChemistInvestor already knows I'm a clueless double shafra so nothing I say is concerning. 😊 Respect, always.
LibyaLiberty	725560670020882432	2016-04-28T05:41:58	ChemistInvestor and he's also threatened by unity and he also needs to be stopped. Even more reason to not want partition.
LibyaLiberty	725560458665664512	2016-04-28T05:41:08	ChemistInvestor 
LibyaLiberty	725560162585550848	2016-04-28T05:39:57	ChemistInvestor it's you who said Haftar would soon free Tripoli,God bless him etc. please don't pretend I'm the only one mentioning him.
LibyaLiberty	725559936739098625	2016-04-28T05:39:03	ChemistInvestor absolutely. And the only way to fix that is to move to unity so official process of reconciliation &amp; reconstruction begins
LibyaLiberty	725559724226281472	2016-04-28T05:38:13	ChemistInvestor I'm not trying to troll you - please don't be offended by my rant - I'm trying to challenge u to think beyond catchphrases
LibyaLiberty	725559525886054400	2016-04-28T05:37:25	ChemistInvestor but you are saying you want Libyans to die so Haftar can control Libya.
LibyaLiberty	725559390057672704	2016-04-28T05:36:53	ChemistInvestor I support a unity gov and a true national army. Just like any normal country. oldmommatajuri
LibyaLiberty	725559146964213760	2016-04-28T05:35:55	ChemistInvestor oldmommatajuri I cannot believe anyone would ASK for more war. Which of your family members are you willing to lose?
LibyaLiberty	725558911290466304	2016-04-28T05:34:59	ChemistInvestor oldmommatajuri tripoli is indeed in a bad place-militia security isnt sustainable. But people tend to flee war zones.
LibyaLiberty	725558549984743424	2016-04-28T05:33:33	ChemistInvestor oldmommatajuri sure that's why so many have fled Benghazi for Tripoli but not the other way.
LibyaLiberty	725558306471813121	2016-04-28T05:32:35	ChemistInvestor and many benghazinos I know now regret Haftar and the war, though they supported it to begin with,because so desperate.
LibyaLiberty	725558133389709317	2016-04-28T05:31:53	ChemistInvestor Gaddafi began w popular appeal too. People can make bad decisions when desperate to find solutions to real problems
LibyaLiberty	725557696058003456	2016-04-28T05:30:09	ChemistInvestor but wait - you said they were planted by the Americans.
LibyaLiberty	725557337415626752	2016-04-28T05:28:44	ChemistInvestor yes,500 people had been killed but thanks to Haftar now 10,000 are dead &amp; thousands of Benghazi residents are homeless.yay!
LibyaLiberty	725557050017746944	2016-04-28T05:27:35	ChemistInvestor so again - another example of blaming everyone but ourselves and refusing to hold ourselves accountable.
LibyaLiberty	725556904001429504	2016-04-28T05:27:00	ChemistInvestor &amp; the internationals have been begging Libyans to deal with Sirte &amp; stop fighting each other-they don't want to send troops
LibyaLiberty	725556678851178496	2016-04-28T05:26:07	ChemistInvestor libya has already been handed over to armed Libyan troops killing their own brothers. If you haven't noticed.
LibyaLiberty	725556515470479360	2016-04-28T05:25:28	ChemistInvestor as we debate this, food prices are skyrocketing &amp;people are dying for lack of medical care. Haftar isn't going to fix that
LibyaLiberty	725556175190786048	2016-04-28T05:24:07	ChemistInvestor If karama forces entered the city, you won't see anyone laughing. There would be fighting. Again.
LibyaLiberty	725555951030403073	2016-04-28T05:23:13	ChemistInvestor you're not talking about terrorism now - you are talking about gaining political control of a nation through military force
LibyaLiberty	725555784151666688	2016-04-28T05:22:33	ChemistInvestor and that's the choice anyone would make. That's your solution. Civil war.
LibyaLiberty	725555661040394240	2016-04-28T05:22:04	ChemistInvestor If Karama forces came to fight my family in Gharian, I would take up arms to fight them.
LibyaLiberty	725555511207301124	2016-04-28T05:21:28	ChemistInvestor what gives your guys the right to claim dominion over all of Libya? What gives any one group?
LibyaLiberty	725555270185803776	2016-04-28T05:20:31	ChemistInvestor I honestly can't understand how anyone thinks "kill your way to peace" is an actual solution!
LibyaLiberty	725555126665109504	2016-04-28T05:19:57	ChemistInvestor I support the effort to unite Libya &amp; get the economy functioning before suggesting killing thousands so a group dominates
LibyaLiberty	725554884326658048	2016-04-28T05:18:59	ChemistInvestor people in Benghazi are buried in graves or internally displaced. 10,000 dead. Not a good enough sales pitch for death.
LibyaLiberty	725553939597410304	2016-04-28T05:15:13	ChemistInvestor FezzanLibyaMG I guess for some people, supporting a political group is more important than saving lives or a nation.
LibyaLiberty	725553772848664576	2016-04-28T05:14:34	ChemistInvestor FezzanLibyaMG so you either support partition or a national civil war, but you think internationals are the problem. Ok.
LibyaLiberty	725553591168151552	2016-04-28T05:13:50	ChemistInvestor FezzanLibyaMG like Benghazi?So if it took years &amp; destroyed people &amp; property,what will it look like on a country-level?
LibyaLiberty	725553102208798720	2016-04-28T05:11:54	ChemistInvestor neither you nor I have a clue the degree of corruption - But I promise you are in denial of scale of it in the east.
LibyaLiberty	725552681260060672	2016-04-28T05:10:13	ChemistInvestor look, you're grasping at straws to defend a position that is indefensible unless you support partition.
LibyaLiberty	725552486531092480	2016-04-28T05:09:27	ChemistInvestor and who said Tripoli isn't corrupt? Benghazi is just as corrupt. Millions coming in but hospitals have no supplies.
LibyaLiberty	725552318503067648	2016-04-28T05:08:47	ChemistInvestor they did that with what money?
LibyaLiberty	725551925043847168	2016-04-28T05:07:13	ChemistInvestor corruption is everywhere. You have no idea how money is spent in the east but are willing to "assume" everyone is honest??
LibyaLiberty	725551175689506817	2016-04-28T05:04:15	ChemistInvestor but waving your flag isn't fixing schools or hospitals or the economy that takes change on the ground and a strong Libya.
LibyaLiberty	725551030533021696	2016-04-28T05:03:40	ChemistInvestor dude, it's up to you. Take a break and think critically and intellectually about the situation, or wave your flag.
LibyaLiberty	725550846616977410	2016-04-28T05:02:56	ChemistInvestor while somehow placing the east on a podium of virtue. That again is simply illogical and not in any way supported by facts.
LibyaLiberty	725550690962145280	2016-04-28T05:02:19	ChemistInvestor just because you don't like fajr doesn't mean you can use that as evidence of any claim of any institution you want.
LibyaLiberty	725550506505043968	2016-04-28T05:01:35	ChemistInvestor and they better be committed to any and all consequences of a war over resources and a possible partition.
LibyaLiberty	725550345485713408	2016-04-28T05:00:57	ChemistInvestor those who support a separate NOC &amp; CBL better be prepared for the consequences of relinquishing any and all $ from Tripoli.
LibyaLiberty	725550071190794240	2016-04-28T04:59:51	ChemistInvestor and god knows where the money goes. You think that kind of complete freedom and control over money ISNT corruption prone??
LibyaLiberty	725549891032899584	2016-04-28T04:59:08	ChemistInvestor then you are in denial. Corruption happens everywhere it's allowed. NOC east isn't subject to the audit bureau.
LibyaLiberty	725549691514007554	2016-04-28T04:58:21	ChemistInvestor two gov, two NOC, two central banks - two countries. That's partition. That's what you are defending.
LibyaLiberty	725549545388691456	2016-04-28T04:57:46	ChemistInvestor and let's say eastern NOC is legit, &amp; send their money to their own CBL. Guess what you have? Two states in a state.
LibyaLiberty	725549364031148032	2016-04-28T04:57:03	ChemistInvestor and if so, how is this fair to other regions, that they have a second source of revenue that over Libyans don't?
LibyaLiberty	725549219638038529	2016-04-28T04:56:28	ChemistInvestor will the east make their own money and STILL expect the main NOC to funnel them their share of $ through the CBL?
LibyaLiberty	725549031758376960	2016-04-28T04:55:43	ChemistInvestor what makes the Benghazi NOC legit? Tell me, where will money they make go? Will all Libyans benefit or just a fraction?
LibyaLiberty	725548843446767617	2016-04-28T04:54:58	ChemistInvestor if we don't hold "our side" accountable, &amp; object when outsiders do, we are just saying "hey do whatever you want."
LibyaLiberty	725548701943521280	2016-04-28T04:54:25	ChemistInvestor but even if you dislike their interference - you can't ignore or erase the damage Libyans are doing to their own country.
LibyaLiberty	725548565293047810	2016-04-28T04:53:52	ChemistInvestor western nations can be your enemy or your allies. We have mutual interests and we can find mutually beneficial solutions.
LibyaLiberty	725548382807281664	2016-04-28T04:53:09	ChemistInvestor there is no country operating within the international community that doesn't have to negotiate w over states. That's life.
LibyaLiberty	725548163612987393	2016-04-28T04:52:16	ChemistInvestor what's going to fix those things? What's going to help the average Libyan? It's not two NOCs I can tell you that for a fact
LibyaLiberty	725548025913954305	2016-04-28T04:51:44	ChemistInvestor They didn't plant Isis there. And again, think about what's happening on the ground - salaries, food prices, healthcare.
LibyaLiberty	725547787375497217	2016-04-28T04:50:47	ChemistInvestor what happens when two NOCs sell oil? What are the very real consequences?
LibyaLiberty	725547585256194048	2016-04-28T04:49:59	ChemistInvestor listen - I know you hate fajr. But this is Libya's future on the line. Put aside your hate &amp; think clearly &amp; logically.
LibyaLiberty	725547151338672129	2016-04-28T04:48:15	ChemistInvestor you think Isis is in Libya because western nations planted them there &amp; they can just remove them &amp; Libya will be fixed?
LibyaLiberty	725546906789789696	2016-04-28T04:47:17	ChemistInvestor I'm saying Libya needs 1 government that oversees the only resource Libya has, but that's fueling a split?That's illogical.
LibyaLiberty	725546433152188416	2016-04-28T04:45:24	ChemistInvestor of course I'm not. Libyans are not leaving Libyans alone - they're killing each other. They don't get to do that forever.
LibyaLiberty	725546249064177664	2016-04-28T04:44:40	ChemistInvestor that sounds good on paper but in practice it's not happening and no nation is an island. There are consequences for all.
LibyaLiberty	725545940992544768	2016-04-28T04:43:26	ChemistInvestor I'm afraid no one is figuring anything out over lunch. Except how to kill each other and steal money while Libyans suffer.
LibyaLiberty	725545726789451778	2016-04-28T04:42:35	ChemistInvestor and are you willing to see Libya split in half with each side promoting their own oil? The stakes are huge.
LibyaLiberty	725545594182356992	2016-04-28T04:42:04	ChemistInvestor are you going to blame the CBL for economic problems while ignoring diversion of major funds?
LibyaLiberty	725545365152382976	2016-04-28T04:41:09	ChemistInvestor even if they're dead, the oil has always gone through the NOC - for decades. What happens to money sold by others?
LibyaLiberty	725545190912614400	2016-04-28T04:40:28	ChemistInvestor why aren't you worried about who's selling oil?
LibyaLiberty	725544025466523648	2016-04-28T04:35:50	reportingLibya it's my theory they knew the ship would be intercepted &amp; someone wants to turn this into a rallying cry for separatism.
LibyaLiberty	725543684045942784	2016-04-28T04:34:28	The US, UK, &amp; UNSC have made it clear oil can only be sold under unity gov authority. This may create a flash point. 
LibyaLiberty	725543366474252288	2016-04-28T04:33:13	reportingLibya it seems the internationals have sent a very clear signal to the eastern version of the NOC.

LibyaLiberty	724827828911505410	2016-04-26T05:09:55	CynicalSultan your claim has no merit because it generalizes a complex situation and ignores positive aspects of faith-based rights.

LibyaLiberty	724810906128007168	2016-04-26T04:02:41	CynicalSultan if you think that an atheists life in the Mid East has more value than a believer, you're not a human rights defender.
LibyaLiberty	724810607548047360	2016-04-26T04:01:29	CynicalSultan but misrepresenting &amp; appropriating an issue to attack a large group under the guise of human rights isn't ok.
LibyaLiberty	724809631453831169	2016-04-26T03:57:37	CynicalSultan taking up a cause of a subset is perfectly fine of course. And I never used the word islamophobic.

LibyaLiberty	723936907730800641	2016-04-23T18:09:43	bilalmahmooduk It's mainstream. Meaning, no one else believes it's Mirza Ghulam Ahmad except Ahmadis, right?
LibyaLiberty	723936743586709505	2016-04-23T18:09:04	bilalmahmooduk imagine another sect came to u,said they have a leader who also claims to be divinely appointed-would u accept them as same?

LibyaLiberty	723936014050406401	2016-04-23T18:06:10	bilalmahmooduk There are differences within sunni, between sunni/shia, and between mainstream/ahmadiya. Can't deny that. It's there.
LibyaLiberty	723935839047286784	2016-04-23T18:05:28	bilalmahmooduk my friend: we don't accept the basic premise of Ahmadiyya, that this man in India claimed to be divinely appointed.
LibyaLiberty	723935373907337216	2016-04-23T18:03:37	MattChambrs IMHO it's a natural process-there is a pattern of migration, conversion:integration over time leads to new community realities

LibyaLiberty	723934885061210112	2016-04-23T18:01:41	bilalmahmooduk There is a saying in Islam- God is with the Group. When the vast majority of Muslims do not hold a belief,it is in question.
LibyaLiberty	723934725451210752	2016-04-23T18:01:03	bilalmahmooduk Mirza Ghulam Ahmad as the Promised Messiah, a self appointed prophet, is what sets Ahmadiyya apart.
LibyaLiberty	723933664833318912	2016-04-23T17:56:50	bilalmahmooduk more importantly-whatever Ahamadiyya's believe, they deserve equal human rights-horrific abuses in Pakistan,etc,must stop.
