Makro_Trader	712326532690219012	2016-03-22T17:14:14	My question How many bears will survive this upcoming move? We could be looking at years of more rally. Dont think so but also upside so big
Makro_Trader	712321763619774464	2016-03-22T16:55:17	Bears have now moved the "It is over for bulls" targets quite a bit . (HInt: You are all wrong)

Makro_Trader	707930662049865729	2016-03-10T14:06:37	Also, DAX overcut upside  target with 5 points. Breaking TDST from an upclose and such less likely to stick this time. Its how we dot it
Makro_Trader	707929700254019584	2016-03-10T14:02:47	Soo. EURUSD almost touched daily TDST coming from a downclose and reversed higher. That was hard to see right?
Makro_Trader	707928994868502529	2016-03-10T13:59:59	So funny to see all the hate at ECB and then a lot of cheering when it turns lower. NegativeBubble

Makro_Trader	707898315019587585	2016-03-10T11:58:05	Best situations ever. Everybody expectes ECB to disappont because consensus and everybody expects ECB to overdeliver.
