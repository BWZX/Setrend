david_j_roth	717216963307692033	2016-04-05T05:07:03	RichardYannow What Speechboys grade this on is how well the answer hews to the received wisdom on it. This bad answer is in the wrong words
david_j_roth	717216755756703744	2016-04-05T05:06:14	RichardYannow It's not a great answer, or question. There is no good answer to this question. Including "I'd stop it, right away."
david_j_roth	717216516173860864	2016-04-05T05:05:17	RichardYannow He is running on those ideas. They're his whole campaign. And every candidate treats this as theater, as you surely know.

david_j_roth	717214139253399552	2016-04-05T04:55:50	RichardYannow That's absurd on its face, imo. I'd add his appeal (and Trump's) owes to the obvious untenability of the status quo.
david_j_roth	717213396865851392	2016-04-05T04:52:53	RichardYannow This is my objection: some armchair knob playing theater critic, grading the bluster for credibility.

david_j_roth	717212675126796290	2016-04-05T04:50:01	RichardYannow It's not a great answer. It's not "I alone can solve," either. You know the answer to the latter questions. Everyone does.

david_j_roth	717211869031825409	2016-04-05T04:46:49	RichardYannow But these are very different things, and this answer is not strictly a Trumpian "It's Good When Good, Bad When Bad."

david_j_roth	703656225003675648	2016-02-27T19:01:31	Innaritu and Penn spend at least 100 hours a year clasping hands meaningfully, calling each other brother, and exchanging thumping man hugs.
david_j_roth	703655960632532992	2016-02-27T19:00:28	I predict THE REVENANT wins but Innaritu can't accept the award because he's backstage clasping Sean Penn's hand and calling him "brother."
david_j_roth	703655480820940801	2016-02-27T18:58:34	I would totally watch a dark 150-minute Innaritu version of Rip Van Winkle just to see Cage destroy it from within. 
david_j_roth	703655251199594497	2016-02-27T18:57:39	atbobb Yes, but only as long as it's UNFLINCHING and absolutely no fun to watch.
david_j_roth	703655113664172032	2016-02-27T18:57:07	brendan_myers Yeah, that is a fair point. I just think of that trophy as a sort of hostage payment.
david_j_roth	703654570531102721	2016-02-27T18:54:57	If THE REVENANT doesn't win an Oscar, Innaritu is just going to make an even longer movie whose stars have even grosser shit in their beards

david_j_roth	703629774304903168	2016-02-27T17:16:25	altoemike This is always a good question.
david_j_roth	703629732428918785	2016-02-27T17:16:15	altoemike I get why the scouts have to be there, sort of. The fact that it's on TV and civilians are watching is pretty much beyond me.
david_j_roth	703627317671645185	2016-02-27T17:06:39	Moose_Bigelow Oh, I would read this very much.
david_j_roth	703627051828248578	2016-02-27T17:05:36	I'm at the NFL Scouting Combine "Hey, check out that guy's ass. Nice." The other assembled media murmurs their assent. I have no credential.
david_j_roth	703624529982062592	2016-02-27T16:55:35	jorgearangure When you get a clean bill of health from the team physicians and are ready to get to work. 
david_j_roth	703623000784941056	2016-02-27T16:49:30	jorgearangure The physical is just a bunch of doctors walking around him and whistling in an impressed sort of way.
david_j_roth	703622800724987905	2016-02-27T16:48:43	I wrote my Weak In Review bit about Delonte West, if you were looking to perk up your brunchtime with fun vibes.
