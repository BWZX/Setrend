haroldpollack	724092650874392576	2016-04-24T04:28:35	MattBruenig chrislhayes good one. I suspect VAT needed for real expansion of government.
haroldpollack	724088260083879938	2016-04-24T04:11:08	PaulaSayles have a good evening.
haroldpollack	724088193071484928	2016-04-24T04:10:52	PaulaSayles samhwils Sanders voters are a major part of the Dem future, but Clinton is winning nomination+Clinton v GOP will be Nov choice
haroldpollack	724087510414958592	2016-04-24T04:08:10	PaulaSayles samhwils I'll just say that many of us voted for Clinton for honorable reasons and care deeply about the same issues you do.
haroldpollack	724087085833973760	2016-04-24T04:06:28	PaulaSayles samhwils Whatever Sanders' virtues, he is unlikely to be Dem nominee. I'd happily vote for him if he were. And Clinton &gt;&gt; GOP.
haroldpollack	724086376967196672	2016-04-24T04:03:39	PaulaSayles samhwils I am glad he ran+pushed debate in progressive direction, but there's a reason almost all liberal Dem pols support HRC
haroldpollack	724086022007459840	2016-04-24T04:02:15	PaulaSayles samhwils your argument is not w/HRC. It is w/virtually every liberal Democrat Ted Kennedy on down who saw what was feasible
haroldpollack	724085141547585536	2016-04-24T03:58:45	PaulaSayles samhwils President Sanders couldn't move single payer either. One would need a huge+cohesive Senate Democratic majority.
haroldpollack	724084427630858241	2016-04-24T03:55:55	PaulaSayles SamSeder samhwils nothing wrong with preferring Sanders over Clinton. The point is that either is much better than GOP rival.
haroldpollack	724079566814236672	2016-04-24T03:36:36	bbrewin I voted for Gore, who would not have invaded Iraq.
haroldpollack	724069553760813056	2016-04-24T02:56:48	Philblank1 samhwils My sense was that Obama supported PO but wasn't willing to risk ACA's prospects on it, esp when it was a long shot.
haroldpollack	724065141067636736	2016-04-24T02:39:16	Philblank1 samhwils I was quite involved with that fight. 
haroldpollack	724062017170997248	2016-04-24T02:26:51	Philblank1 samhwils For a brief moment we did. If we had a few more Senate votes, we would have done more.
haroldpollack	724061697720209411	2016-04-24T02:25:35	MCCindy64 samhwils You deal w/choice you have in November. Immigrants, minorities, individuals on public aid will all want Clinton to win.
haroldpollack	724058932935843840	2016-04-24T02:14:36	You'll have to decode that one for me. 
haroldpollack	724058351705923584	2016-04-24T02:12:18	rsmitley samhwils nothing wrong with preferring Sanders. But other Democrats decided differently. The choice will be her or Trump/Cruz.
haroldpollack	724056135116967936	2016-04-24T02:03:29	rsmitley samhwils Sanders will negotiate with Hillary and eventually extend his endorsement. Then you can decide.
haroldpollack	724055773416927233	2016-04-24T02:02:03	fridapoco because she's spent last 40yrs supporting liberal+feminist causes. Because almost every liberal Dem official supports her, etc.
haroldpollack	724054540597755904	2016-04-24T01:57:09	rsmitley samhwils I had arguments like this w/Nader voters in 2000.
haroldpollack	724053847157645312	2016-04-24T01:54:24	fridapoco Hillary would appoint liberal Supreme Court justices who would improve people's lives. It's not about us+how we feel.
haroldpollack	724053257249783808	2016-04-24T01:52:03	jbarro yup 
haroldpollack	724050553504993284	2016-04-24T01:41:18	jbarro have you looked at the Campaign Zero documents? Some good stuff there.
haroldpollack	724050178991333377	2016-04-24T01:39:49	A key model is ACT UP, which was confrontational &amp; upset a lot of people but also had a very specific policy agenda. 
haroldpollack	724049092339503104	2016-04-24T01:35:30	The word "just" is doing a lot of work here. He's not saying it's not okay to yell; he's saying it's not sufficient. 
haroldpollack	724049501296693248	2016-04-24T01:37:07	fridapoco your choice. Do you live in a battleground state? Maybe you can find progressive candidate you are passionate about down ballot.
haroldpollack	724048595859722240	2016-04-24T01:33:32	samhwils I think most progressives will do exactly that once the nomination fight is resolved and Dems come together.
haroldpollack	724048381249740800	2016-04-24T01:32:40	samhwils I think one should  fight like heck for one's favorite candidate+then vote for the Democrats, in every election.
haroldpollack	724047833184219136	2016-04-24T01:30:30	fridapoco overlayered  you are correct. She is down to +36 after recent dust ups w/Sanders. She's still doing well 
haroldpollack	724046413487812608	2016-04-24T01:24:51	fridapoco overlayered  this was what I remembered. Haven't seen more current s. Twitter magnifies disagreement 
haroldpollack	724045383811391490	2016-04-24T01:20:46	samhwils I believe strongly in universal coverage, supported public option. Best way to move that forward is to have Dem pre+Sen majority.
haroldpollack	724039336346288128	2016-04-24T00:56:44	haroldpollack DanaHoule samhwils as does the LGBT community as they fend off law after law aimed at denying them rights. Purity
haroldpollack	724037897003892736	2016-04-24T00:51:01	overlayered HillaryClinton has something like a +55 favorability rating among Dems. Off Twitter I don't thing she'll have a bad problem.
haroldpollack	724036850394894336	2016-04-24T00:46:51	haroldpollack samhwils Besides, it's not like the Supreme Court is that important. We can always hope to flip it next generation.
haroldpollack	724036489290588160	2016-04-24T00:45:25	tabgirl thank you?

haroldpollack	724033978706067456	2016-04-24T00:35:27	I'm sure some single mom who needs Medicaid+reproductive health services very much appreciates that preciousness.

haroldpollack	723951815885090816	2016-04-23T19:08:57	hyperplanes yeah some of that may be in play

haroldpollack	723949339312168960	2016-04-23T18:59:07	Josephriskgmt yeah that's pretty fair. Low end of the market pretty tough.
haroldpollack	723948938277982209	2016-04-23T18:57:31	This is all part of the woofing and negotiation. Dems will be fine in the end. Both sides looking for dignified path
