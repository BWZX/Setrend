rob_schmitz	685285850255507456	2016-01-08T02:24:13	My convo w/kairyssdal on Marketplace today a/b why SHSE's crashes matter less than China's real economy, bad debt: 
rob_schmitz	685134656539209728	2016-01-07T16:23:25	China's stock market giving you the shakes? Try some owl-marinated liquor.  
rob_schmitz	685262795391160320	2016-01-08T00:52:36	That just might work. Whenever shares drop 5%, a circuit breaker would turn on a giant boombox to blast the song.

rob_schmitz	684933408967884800	2016-01-07T03:03:44	derznovich Impossible to know. If gov wants it, it's for short-term gain at expense of long-term problems. Catch-up scenario more likely
rob_schmitz	684931527461830658	2016-01-07T02:56:16	derznovich CH gov fixes rate w/in parameters, but has less &amp; less say in valuation of RMB - It's at mercy of variety of economic realities.
rob_schmitz	684928115894685696	2016-01-07T02:42:42	14 minutes.  That was the length of actual trading in China today.  1st circuit breaker after 13 mins, 2nd trigger 1 min after resuming
