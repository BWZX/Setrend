tunkuv	710226580887506949	2016-03-16T22:09:46	6. That's why trade-bashing is such phony populism. It's asking the govt to protect the few at the expense of the great majority.
tunkuv	710226066430935040	2016-03-16T22:07:44	5. So even if you ignore economic evidence &amp; assume free trade hurts non-export manufacturing workers, it benefits &gt; 80% of Americans.
tunkuv	710225678839517184	2016-03-16T22:06:11	4. Even Nat'l Assn of Manufacturing figures for jobs "supported" by manufacturing = well below 20% of workers.
tunkuv	710225321199575040	2016-03-16T22:04:46	3. Costs of free trade fall only on people in manufacturing - (~9% now of US workforce) - and only those in non-export manufacturing.
tunkuv	710224864385351680	2016-03-16T22:02:57	2. On the producer side, free trade benefits people in manufacturing who work in exports.
