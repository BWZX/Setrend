Sanjay__Bakshi	693807113894670336	2016-01-31T14:44:40	A sentence in Buffett's letter in 2000 Annual Report is worth reflecting upon. What did he mean?

Sanjay__Bakshi	689979047468765189	2016-01-21T01:13:18	manishmanwani74 And it's such a powerful idea. It has prevented horrendous losses for me. 
Sanjay__Bakshi	689977546394488832	2016-01-21T01:07:20	manishmanwani74 And Graham laid this all out - the idea of looking at fixed charges ratio in a really bad year for cyclicals - in his books

Sanjay__Bakshi	689796053218910208	2016-01-20T13:06:09	Anil_Tulsiram Thanks Anil. In my view, that post should be read along with this one: 
Sanjay__Bakshi	689795130883072002	2016-01-20T13:02:29	mashok26 what's the meaning of medium term value creation???

Sanjay__Bakshi	687632209759477760	2016-01-14T13:47:49	ruchi_still That's true only for short-lived opportunities. Some opportunities (slow hunches) come from long exposures.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687628622325104640	2016-01-14T13:33:33	Anil_Tulsiram A great pick no doubt. But not necessarily a great portfolio.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687628430918029314	2016-01-14T13:32:48	Anil_Tulsiram Yah but that's the functional equivalent of buying 100 stocks and then finding one of them turning out to be a 10 bagger.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687610221833760769	2016-01-14T12:20:26	victoryaditya Yes but U have to be almost certain that VW can pay max penalty WITHOUT impairment of ability to compete in a tough industry.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687608886396727301	2016-01-14T12:15:08	victoryaditya Maybe. I haven't done the work. So for me there is uncertainty AND risk. letsgrowmoney
Sanjay__Bakshi	687608469302579200	2016-01-14T12:13:28	victoryaditya How sure are you about those projections in terms of probability? What usually happens to such projections? letsgrowmoney

Sanjay__Bakshi	687607724368990209	2016-01-14T12:10:31	victoryaditya If you don't then you don't know the downside. You need to know how much max you can lose. letsgrowmoney

Sanjay__Bakshi	687602018588823552	2016-01-14T11:47:50	letsgrowmoney That's true as well. There is never complete info and sometimes, U should bet on high uncertainty low risk situations.

Sanjay__Bakshi	687596461488340992	2016-01-14T11:25:46	simpleharish Precisely. And when you get it, you have to act promptly.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687595970570289152	2016-01-14T11:23:48	Sometimes you're shooting in the dark so you compensate by allowing more time to pass for the light to enter the lens.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687595011836256257	2016-01-14T11:20:00	You would pick a macro lens for shooting narrow "niches" while you need wide-angle lens for panoramic shots for global businesses.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687594151018287104	2016-01-14T11:16:35	Graham used this trick of comparing two balance sheets (snapshots) of the same company 5 years apart because slow change goes unnoticed.

Sanjay__Bakshi	687592600782508032	2016-01-14T11:10:25	Sometimes you have to zoom in - e.g. when we look at segment profitability. And sometimes we have to zoom out to "look at the big picture."
Sanjay__Bakshi	687592297223995392	2016-01-14T11:09:13	If you use wide open aperture, U get shots like this.An intense focus on main object while everything else is blurry 
Sanjay__Bakshi	687591800995840000	2016-01-14T11:07:14	The best cameramen know how to create the perfect frame. They know there is lots of information. But they know what to leave out.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687591143593259008	2016-01-14T11:04:38	nikhilmjain Excellent. A balance sheet is like a photo. A snapshot taken at a particular moment. And people dress up for pics...

Sanjay__Bakshi	687495706353905665	2016-01-14T04:45:24	Vijay_Pahwa Yes, its the evolutionary arms race model. Very hard to get predictable cash flows...
Sanjay__Bakshi	687494078498390018	2016-01-14T04:38:55	"It is possible that whitefly has developed resistance to the commonly used pesticides." 
Sanjay__Bakshi	687331110284480512	2016-01-13T17:51:21	p_rishi_2000 Absolutely. It's a wonderful quote. But ppl at Valeant (and its backers) didn't agree with Charlie.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687326884871340032	2016-01-13T17:34:33	p_rishi_2000 Precisely. And the focus is on the word "can." Many franchise businesses wisely choose not to screw customers.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687325740119932929	2016-01-13T17:30:00	AkashJainN Very nice. Thanks Akash.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687322435872399360	2016-01-13T17:16:53	whitedwarfak ðŸ˜€ I will take that as a compliment. I have other ghosts too but they are very shy.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687316687452913664	2016-01-13T16:54:02	Has anyone seen any discussion of this gem tucked away in Buffett's 1986 letter?  including its wider application?
Sanjay__Bakshi	687260356134080513	2016-01-13T13:10:12	omnilogist Not necessarily. But sometimes, yes.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687245873336586242	2016-01-13T12:12:39	shabanais :-)
Sanjay__Bakshi	687245243503132672	2016-01-13T12:10:09	shabanais Reminds of an Economist magazine quote I read many many years ago and saved up... 
Sanjay__Bakshi	687244406974332928	2016-01-13T12:06:49	Ayush_Agg ALL mental models have "functional equivalents." That why they are models. They can be applied elsewhere.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687241264635318272	2016-01-13T11:54:20	jagvir Yup, I included them in "frictional costs"
Sanjay__Bakshi	687241071131148288	2016-01-13T11:53:34	Ayush_Agg You haven't looked carefully. I have more than a dozen references. And no, I won't be spoon-feeding you. :-)
Sanjay__Bakshi	687240594616274944	2016-01-13T11:51:40	Betankrich Exactly.The thrill of an insight is not just its immediate return.Real thrill comes from: Where else can I use this? Ayush_Agg
Sanjay__Bakshi	687239268079538178	2016-01-13T11:46:24	Ayush_Agg It's not my idea. It's Charlie Munger's idea. I just copied it and try to implement it routinely as I promised him.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687238882744664064	2016-01-13T11:44:52	Ayush_Agg Betankrich Naturally. Every discipline has super texts.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687238169205460992	2016-01-13T11:42:02	Betankrich But, that's not the case when someone switches from say a 20 PE stock to a 10 PE stock.Such switches r prone to far more errors.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687237172827561984	2016-01-13T11:38:04	Betankrich Because one is giving up virtually nothing but getting back something much more in return &amp; this can be very easily demonstrated
Sanjay__Bakshi	687236412052131841	2016-01-13T11:35:03	rameshgmehta1 Look what you started. :-)
Sanjay__Bakshi	687235881271349248	2016-01-13T11:32:56	Betankrich :-) I pulled them from my head.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687235685745430528	2016-01-13T11:32:10	Betankrich In switching operations, key question is What am giving up in vs what I am getting? And in such examples, one sees no-brainers.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687229896603467776	2016-01-13T11:09:10	Sanjay__Bakshi With minor amendments: 
Sanjay__Bakshi	687227345829150720	2016-01-13T10:59:01	Here are four. 
Sanjay__Bakshi	687224269860769792	2016-01-13T10:46:48	. What are the functional equivalents of such operations in financial markets? Ayush_Agg Betankrich
Sanjay__Bakshi	687223163244032000	2016-01-13T10:42:24	Ayush_Agg No, you can't. You can only switch out of something expensive into something identical, but much cheaper Betankrich
Sanjay__Bakshi	687222354900987904	2016-01-13T10:39:12	Betankrich Precisely.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687222186726195200	2016-01-13T10:38:31	Iamsamirarora True but I think Amazon fixes royalties as % of price over which it has complete control at least in some markets mfasil
Sanjay__Bakshi	687220789251149824	2016-01-13T10:32:58	Betankrich There is no arbitrage. U can only fix a mistake once. Why wud u repeat it again? Just for the thrill of switching again?
Sanjay__Bakshi	687219776125403137	2016-01-13T10:28:57	pardeepg I am down with a cold so my nose is not functioning well. Besides, you should read this  safalniveshak
Sanjay__Bakshi	687219402266165248	2016-01-13T10:27:28	nikhilmjain What's the cost of creating an additional copy of an e-book?
Sanjay__Bakshi	687219018277650432	2016-01-13T10:25:56	Betankrich You know how Jeff thinks right?
Sanjay__Bakshi	687216378214940672	2016-01-13T10:15:27	mfasil Absolutely. And in e-books,amazon can afford to be very aggressive in new geographies as cost of additional copy is zero.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687215610544062465	2016-01-13T10:12:24	nikhilmjain Think about it from amazon's point of view.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687215333514477568	2016-01-13T10:11:18	nikhilmjain Right. What else?
Sanjay__Bakshi	687214863634935808	2016-01-13T10:09:25	What could such a huge price differential for identical goods with zero transportation costs mean?
Sanjay__Bakshi	687214403754672128	2016-01-13T10:07:36	According to Law of One Price a good must sell for the same price in all locations. . So much for EMT.
Sanjay__Bakshi	687208807697526785	2016-01-13T09:45:22	On a volatility day, I did a switching operation.  Ben Graham would be so proud. Thank you rameshgmehta1

Sanjay__Bakshi	687166427023851520	2016-01-13T06:56:57	jvembuna Those are four very good lessons. In any case parents should only nudge and not force it.
