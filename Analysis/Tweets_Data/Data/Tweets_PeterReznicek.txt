PeterReznicek	725777576451530753	2016-04-28T20:03:53	Not fun watching this obviously but lesson learned to have the right position on at zero cost when playing earnings.  AMZN +70 ah
PeterReznicek	725773002265206784	2016-04-28T19:45:42	I'd rather  watch it gap to $700 and make next to nothing than see it go to $550 and lose the entire debit which was a decent amt of $$
PeterReznicek	725772800087187456	2016-04-28T19:44:54	I got the price of those condors down by a lot but nowhere near zero.  One thing I don't do is gamble.  not ever.
PeterReznicek	725772461246140416	2016-04-28T19:43:33	FYI to options players at close AMZN, I am out about 95% of my call spreads for a tiny gain.  I don't like the 50/50 odds when I have debit

PeterReznicek	716325752745160704	2016-04-02T18:05:42	rwfnortheast2 agreed, but note there is "carrying information forward" and there is "fighting a trend".  Don't do the latter.

PeterReznicek	714478755280977922	2016-03-28T15:46:24	vikeneeds2bike means that every pullback in AMZN was buyable today.
PeterReznicek	714475937379848192	2016-03-28T15:35:12	When the shorter term auction is running counter to the longer term auction, that is an opportunity.
PeterReznicek	714475833914757120	2016-03-28T15:34:47	AMZN is a classic example of the longer term trend dominating which makes early liquidation break always buyable.
PeterReznicek	714470237614292992	2016-03-28T15:12:33	Pittstock1 bullish, it means the move is over for the moment

PeterReznicek	714445372706451456	2016-03-28T13:33:45	AMZN failed early right below the $585 breakout point discussed in video.  Nothing to do yet and it makes the breakout point even better.
