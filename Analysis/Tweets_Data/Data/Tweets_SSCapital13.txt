SSCapital13	726082314640457729	2016-04-29T16:14:48	sternalot BluegrassCap agree - it's only good when it's free

SSCapital13	726080157161807872	2016-04-29T16:06:14	sternalot BluegrassCap PYPL will probably be ok but a lot of tail risk. They could get a lot more aggressive w/ Visa Checkout

SSCapital13	726077965306593280	2016-04-29T15:57:31	sternalot BluegrassCap yes it is additive. It's a loss leader to vertically integrate in value chain, own the consumer, expand into mobile

SSCapital13	726076258925305856	2016-04-29T15:50:44	sternalot BluegrassCap why does it have to be exclusive?
SSCapital13	726074997668630529	2016-04-29T15:45:43	sternalot BluegrassCap they already have merchant network. Create DTC apps, offer incentives and outsource credit

SSCapital13	726058509197033472	2016-04-29T14:40:12	BluegrassCap Hence my initial comment. I still maintain that they can kill PYPL if they want to
SSCapital13	726058402422611968	2016-04-29T14:39:47	BluegrassCap I don't think that's true. I think they have tons of re-investment and strategic opps but seem incapable of it
