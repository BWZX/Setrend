mckaycoppins	719612508860878848	2016-04-11T19:46:06	I mean, the deadline to change party registration was October 9th! That's pointlessly prohibitive.
mckaycoppins	719611884484370432	2016-04-11T19:43:37	Upon further reflection, I've decided Trump's kids should get a pass here on the grounds that NY's primary/registration rules are stupid.

mckaycoppins	719534727049383936	2016-04-11T14:37:01	This was clear back in September. One of the reasons it was futile for RNC to try and tame him. 
mckaycoppins	719547765622185984	2016-04-11T15:28:50	Whoops. Trump's kids failed to register as Republicans in New York so they can't vote for him in the GOP primary.

mckaycoppins	718983042296127488	2016-04-10T02:04:49	Related fun fact: I once quoted  Thoreau's "lives of quiet desperation" line in a Jeb Bush story but katherinemiller made me take it out.
mckaycoppins	718812364011880448	2016-04-09T14:46:37	If there wasn't a genuine question of basic competence I'd think Trump was throwing the delegate process and daring them not to acquiesce.

mckaycoppins	715003329663918081	2016-03-30T02:30:52	No, Bill, the *real* issue is the threat of reporters carrying little bomb pens into Donald Trump's campaign events

mckaycoppins	714868009203081216	2016-03-29T17:33:09	Key takeaway from this episode. 
mckaycoppins	714862603219116033	2016-03-29T17:11:40	Lewandowski's lawyer is a real pro (who *might* have resigned from US attorney after *allegedly* biting a stripper.) 
mckaycoppins	714861013225615360	2016-03-29T17:05:21	Despite Trump camp's insistence that Lewandowski wasn't arrested, police spox says “a notice to appear is an arrest"

mckaycoppins	714849968931094528	2016-03-29T16:21:28	To my earlier point, Trump was fishing this AM for a reason to skip CNN town hall. If he feels CNN unfair today.. 
mckaycoppins	714841912671338496	2016-03-29T15:49:27	that became the preferred take, but the reaction at first was simply denying Lewandowski even did it

mckaycoppins	709913994962837504	2016-03-16T01:27:40	No matter what the outcome—Trump emerging as GOP standard-bearer or the frontrunner getting "robbed" of nomination—huge numbers will revolt.
mckaycoppins	709913119267680258	2016-03-16T01:24:11	Can't think of a scenario more likely to permanently fracture the GOP than a contested convention this year. Looks like we're headed there.

mckaycoppins	709897308406726656	2016-03-16T00:21:22	Rubio: "It is clear that while we are on the right side, this year we will not be on the winning side."
mckaycoppins	709896960229113856	2016-03-16T00:19:59	Rubio says the country needs a conservative movement that is based on ideas and Judeo-Christian values, "not on anger and fear."
mckaycoppins	709896734202306560	2016-03-16T00:19:05	Rubio blames current 2016 chaos on a political establishment that "has too  long looked down on conservatives as simply bomb throwers"

mckaycoppins	709806203468128256	2016-03-15T18:19:21	That said, Rubio advisers claim their donors have been calling regularly to urge him to stay in no matter what happens in Florida. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
mckaycoppins	709805148458115073	2016-03-15T18:15:09	It's totally plausible that Rubio really does move on to Utah after losing Florida. Doesn't mean he's staying in the race.
mckaycoppins	709804737164677124	2016-03-15T18:13:31	I'd take Rubio's pledge w/ a grain of salt. He has no incentive right now to dampen supporters' enthusiasm by saying he'll drop out post-FL.

mckaycoppins	709557034467856384	2016-03-15T01:49:14	Five days ago, Rubio called on Latino supporters in Miami to vote in "massive numbers." Tonight he says he needs "historic numbers" to win.

mckaycoppins	709554269733711872	2016-03-15T01:38:15	(Though obviously that worked because Romney ended up dominating that debate. Maybe Mormons are fasting for Brother Rubio now, too?)
mckaycoppins	709554010378862593	2016-03-15T01:37:13	Which reminded me of this time Mormons planned a fast for Mitt Romney ahead of the first presidential debate.

mckaycoppins	705785191327883264	2016-03-04T16:01:17	Trump took a moment at last night's debate to call me out for the worst prediction of my career. Allow me to repent: 
mckaycoppins	705606001635041280	2016-03-04T04:09:14	My grades:  [Grabs keys off table, says “I’m going to get cigarettes.” Drives away into the night, leaving it all behind.]
mckaycoppins	705625737445789698	2016-03-04T05:27:40	Trump now reversing his announced flip-flop on H1B visas. Press release: 
mckaycoppins	705625395840745472	2016-03-04T05:26:18	Isn't this one of the biggest problems with the Cruz-Rubio "unity ticket" idea? Cruz pretty emphatically against it. 
mckaycoppins	705624238380552192	2016-03-04T05:21:42	This is... not great spin. 
mckaycoppins	705592831272951808	2016-03-04T03:16:54	After tonight, Trump's going to win Ohio 29-28-27-16. And Florida 28-27-26-18. And take all the delegates. And rule us.
mckaycoppins	705620634991259648	2016-03-04T05:07:23	?????? 
mckaycoppins	705619091239731201	2016-03-04T05:01:15	Neal_Dewing I just don't believe that "broken pledge" would actually be a bigger story than "Rubio only candidate who won't back Trump"
mckaycoppins	705617827479289856	2016-03-04T04:56:14	One of the reasons Romney went at Trump so aggressively today &gt;&gt; 
mckaycoppins	705617135209308160	2016-03-04T04:53:29	Neal_Dewing And, honestly, NeverTrump has been a huge part of Rubio's message — probably too late to change that
mckaycoppins	705616988458979328	2016-03-04T04:52:54	Neal_Dewing I get that. But as maggieNYT noted earlier, Rubio spent virtually no time making an affirmative case for his candidacy tonight
mckaycoppins	705616722712133632	2016-03-04T04:51:51	I would have been one of those people. Now I'm just the idiot who ordered a NeverTrump bumper sticker from him  
mckaycoppins	705614714793959424	2016-03-04T04:43:52	That may end up being the debate answer Rubio regrets most in 2016. Imagine how amped up his base would be if he'd contrasted w/ Cruz there.
mckaycoppins	705613447447228416	2016-03-04T04:38:50	If you can't find yourself a NeverTrump candidate, at least you can settle for one who sells NeverTrump stickers! 
mckaycoppins	705608748560060416	2016-03-04T04:20:09	If MittRomney WAS angling for a 3rd-party run (or to get drafted from the convention floor) he would tweet NeverTrump right now.
mckaycoppins	705606567714902017	2016-03-04T04:11:29	JR_Grif were you a Rubio supporter?
mckaycoppins	705605160983261184	2016-03-04T04:05:54	True. Real truce this time. 
mckaycoppins	705603447576334337	2016-03-04T03:59:06	I have been trying to get the Rubio campaign to answer this question for the past three days. No response. Big problem for his message, no?
mckaycoppins	705602896490967040	2016-03-04T03:56:54	So, uh... how does the NeverTrump crowd feel about the fact that Rubio just said he will support Trump if he wins the nomination?
mckaycoppins	705600844163473408	2016-03-04T03:48:45	maggieNYT True. And since the fight over who gets to be the anti-Trump standard-bearer is basically pointless at this stage, Trump wins.
mckaycoppins	705599986336043009	2016-03-04T03:45:20	You think Rubio had a Trump attack line in his back pocket just in case yoga came up in the debate...? 
mckaycoppins	705599207214751748	2016-03-04T03:42:15	I think it's been extremely well established that there's a wide swath of the GOP electorate that doesn't care whether Trump is conservative
mckaycoppins	705598951190241281	2016-03-04T03:41:14	Only way the "Trump's not a real conservative" argument makes sense is if the point is for Cruz to rally his base. 
mckaycoppins	705598665805574144	2016-03-04T03:40:05	Cruz is doing a solid job against Trump tonight, but Rubio gets the award for the best ad-lib there.

mckaycoppins	705594834275405828	2016-03-04T03:24:52	Want to feel old?  It's been more than an hour since Donald Trump talked about his penis size.

mckaycoppins	705592938114322433	2016-03-04T03:17:20	FWIW, it is historically stunning that candidates are using national debate time to debate polls/process.

mckaycoppins	705588839172038656	2016-03-04T03:01:03	Actually think this is fairly warranted. He's on the verge of winning the nomination and hasn't answered key Qs... 
mckaycoppins	705587604540882944	2016-03-04T02:56:08	Trump is essentially justifying the murder of innocent women and children by saying, "Hey it wouldn't be as bad as those terrorist animals."

mckaycoppins	705583950224228353	2016-03-04T02:41:37	So technically realDonaldTrump is wrong that I said he'd never run "under ANY circumstances." But I did say the likelihood was quite low!
mckaycoppins	705582803606372352	2016-03-04T02:37:04	What I wrote was Trump's "about as likely to run for president in his lifetime as he is to accept follicular defeat"

mckaycoppins	704973181040263168	2016-03-02T10:14:38	Trump was predicted to win 10 of 11 Super Tuesday races. Instead he won just 7, and 3 victories were by 3% or less. He can still be beaten

mckaycoppins	704909800308658177	2016-03-02T06:02:47	katespencer broader arguments abt likability etc. aside, the practical answer is Kasich has no ability to win the nomination at this point
mckaycoppins	704908963918303232	2016-03-02T05:59:28	This is starting to look less like message discipline and more like the RNC hasn't noticed their house is on fire. 
mckaycoppins	704907334003326977	2016-03-02T05:52:59	Establishment Republicans are furious with Kasich, who almost certainly prevented Rubio from winning Virginia.

mckaycoppins	704882912093724672	2016-03-02T04:15:56	Agree, though "If he wins Florida" is a huge "if." Maybe even yuge.  
mckaycoppins	704882260139499520	2016-03-02T04:13:21	There's the win Rubio team has needed to quiet the chorus of "can't even win a state" critics.

mckaycoppins	704873440424153088	2016-03-02T03:38:18	But since there's virtually no chance of that kind of consolidation happening, they say best realistic option may be to keep splitting vote
mckaycoppins	704873190737182720	2016-03-02T03:37:19	I should add that a lot of anti-Trump Republicans would still *prefer* that all but one candidate drop out tomorrow and endorse same guy 1/2
mckaycoppins	704871999617818624	2016-03-02T03:32:35	This seems to be the emerging consensus among the anti-Trump GOP sources I'm hearing from.

mckaycoppins	704801640642117632	2016-03-01T22:53:00	Rubio says if Cruz can't win big on Super Tuesday, "it only gets worse for him," before adding: "It only gets better for us."
mckaycoppins	704821616518295553	2016-03-02T00:12:22	Reaaaaaallllll chance that Kasich's hurt Rubio quite a bit in Virginia.

mckaycoppins	704768940841381888	2016-03-01T20:43:04	I spent last spring working on a profile of Huckabee that I never finished because he got nowhere in the polls.

mckaycoppins	704766321884397568	2016-03-01T20:32:39	To summarize: Trump wooed Huckabee by treating him like he was important while GOP ignored/mocked him. Parallels?

mckaycoppins	704756617460318208	2016-03-01T19:54:06	Two sources close to Huckabee tell me he hasn't endorsed Trump because it'd make it harder to get back on Fox News.

mckaycoppins	703045824679432194	2016-02-26T02:36:01	Trump has a very economical way of talking about issues he doesn't know very much about. "We gotta keep preexisting condition."

mckaycoppins	701902617048289281	2016-02-22T22:53:19	Lol just had a thought that is much less ludicrous than it sounds: if Cruz does pull this off he should ask Sanders to be his running mate
mckaycoppins	701902089379680257	2016-02-22T22:51:13	Lapdogwhistle yes, bascially
mckaycoppins	701897415800926209	2016-02-22T22:32:39	SeanHarteau true, though there's a big difference between putting out a press release endorsement and actually working the levers for rubio
mckaycoppins	701896541699616768	2016-02-22T22:29:10	Slavic_Wonder Neal_Dewing mostly just help them raise money (which isn't nothing)
mckaycoppins	701896362233712640	2016-02-22T22:28:28	JECarter4 nah, in my experience mormons love to find out famous people used to be mormon (unless they routinely bad-mouth the faith)
mckaycoppins	701895669338931200	2016-02-22T22:25:42	JECarter4 almost certainly helps him
mckaycoppins	701895292824584192	2016-02-22T22:24:13	That said, I can totally see the endorsements having zero effect with voters. Probably help Rubio raise some money but beyond that... meh.
mckaycoppins	701895050481958912	2016-02-22T22:23:15	I don't buy theory that GOP endorsements will hurt Rubio. Any voter that wants a candidate to torch the establishment was never voting Rubio

mckaycoppins	701889963021864960	2016-02-22T22:03:02	LizzieBedDeath my guess is Rubio wins a majority of them, and maybe a big majority. But Cruz could get a decent chunk too.
mckaycoppins	701889699690864641	2016-02-22T22:01:59	HeerJeet indeed. I report here that Romney's been talking up Rubio behind the scenes with donors/Mormon politicos. But no endorsement yet.
mckaycoppins	701889004883484672	2016-02-22T21:59:13	wyseapple also a big part of it in my (anecdotal) experience
mckaycoppins	701888746560487424	2016-02-22T21:58:12	The problem of course is that Mitt isn't running this time. Rubio's team has done a lot to consolidate LDS support, but will they turn out?
mckaycoppins	701888414182875136	2016-02-22T21:56:53	This is why some in Rubio camp are more bullish on NV than they're letting on publicly. Mormons were 25% of caucuses here last two cycle.
mckaycoppins	701887450424029185	2016-02-22T21:53:03	Two of Trump's most popular campaign themes — immigration crackdown and Muslim-bashing — are considerably less popular with Mormon Repubs.

mckaycoppins	701409466210770945	2016-02-21T14:13:42	Extremely curious about the "30-minute scripture and prayer service in the atrium above the Cinnabon" being announced in the CLT airport.
mckaycoppins	701276958487928832	2016-02-21T05:27:10	Yep. Again, Trump is *winning* self-described moderate Republican voters.

mckaycoppins	701265540476760067	2016-02-21T04:41:48	Both candidates could, obviously, end up winning their parties' nominations. But come on. Trolling isn't that hard to detect.
mckaycoppins	701264738265776128	2016-02-21T04:38:37	The most boring, transparently bad-faith punditry of 2016 involves conservatives hyping Sanders and liberals hyping Trump.

mckaycoppins	701244983219765248	2016-02-21T03:20:07	The Rubio campaign appears perfectly on track to execute their vaunted 3-5-2-2 path to the nomination.
mckaycoppins	701244188076146688	2016-02-21T03:16:57	Newt Gingrich and Sean Hannity on Fox News right now competing for the best gigs in the Trump regime.
mckaycoppins	701231193111535617	2016-02-21T02:25:19	Rubio: "If it is God's will that we should win... then history will say on this night in SC we took the 1st step to a new American century."
mckaycoppins	701230385972248576	2016-02-21T02:22:06	"Now, practically speaking, it's down to three," Rubio says.
mckaycoppins	701228937909821441	2016-02-21T02:16:21	Still, though... Rubio is going to have to actually win a primary pretty soon, right?
mckaycoppins	701228726269378560	2016-02-21T02:15:31	Jeb sure did help Rubio by dropping out tonight (as opposed to tomorrow). Gave his campaign something to celebrate regardless of SC results.

mckaycoppins	701226766120030209	2016-02-21T02:07:43	It's almost as if Donald Trump is not necessarily known for personal graciousness! 
mckaycoppins	701226525761388544	2016-02-21T02:06:46	Key Trump close: "Lets win in Nevada, let's have a big night in the SEC, and let's PUT THIS THING AWAY"
mckaycoppins	701225298709258240	2016-02-21T02:01:54	MattZeitlin very unlikely in this case. Jeb has basically positioned his whole message in direct opposition to Trump.
mckaycoppins	701223950022348800	2016-02-21T01:56:32	Aide says Rubio is going to go live right after Trump. Apparently not waiting to find out who's 2nd or 3rd — declaring victory now.
mckaycoppins	701221572892188673	2016-02-21T01:47:05	Crowd at Rubio rally pretty ecstatic as they watch Jeb announce he's dropping out —acting like this is a bigger win than any outcome in SC.
mckaycoppins	701221293581012992	2016-02-21T01:45:59	Loud applause here at the Rubio rally as Jeb announces he's dropping out. 
mckaycoppins	701220240915451904	2016-02-21T01:41:48	Sounds like Jeb isn't just conceding SC — he's dropping out.
mckaycoppins	701219360493297664	2016-02-21T01:38:18	In 2012, Nikki Haley crisscrossed the state for 11 days stumping for Romney—who blew a 12 point lead &amp; lost to Newt. 
mckaycoppins	701218620312055808	2016-02-21T01:35:21	Trump is leading in every S.C. country except Richland, where Rubio leads 27.8 to 22.9 percent support.
mckaycoppins	701216493468413952	2016-02-21T01:26:54	Welp. Ben Carson on TV right now telling supporters he's not dropping out. So... Jeb?
mckaycoppins	701215827001933824	2016-02-21T01:24:15	Revising this: I could see Jeb drop out in coming days. Ditto Carson (though I'm not sure how much that helps Rubio) 
mckaycoppins	701215359269908480	2016-02-21T01:22:24	guypbenson which one are you putting in the "definitely won't quite" column?
mckaycoppins	701215068092911616	2016-02-21T01:21:14	That said, I still think if Jeb/Kasich/Carson all quit tomorrow, Rubio would be biggest beneficiary.  Problem is they're not going to quit.

mckaycoppins	701209503279161344	2016-02-21T00:59:08	A lot of Trump votes are protest votes. Very little he can do to drive those protesters away.   
mckaycoppins	701205905212358656	2016-02-21T00:44:50	Crowd at Rubio rally basically ignoring Fox News as they call the South Carolina race for Trump. It's all about 2nd. 
mckaycoppins	701190027196416005	2016-02-20T23:41:44	Trump doesn't do "dirty tricks" in the traditional sense. He slings mud/spreads rumors/smears rivals from the podium

mckaycoppins	696340376404287488	2016-02-07T14:30:57	realOBF it's totally plausible that they heard from a few wavering donors. I'm just saying I doubt there's a mass exodus right now.
mckaycoppins	696336112462249984	2016-02-07T14:14:01	Breakfast yesterday with Trevornoah (who's holding up his hand here so I can photoshop a copy of my book into it). 
mckaycoppins	696329071215648770	2016-02-07T13:46:02	Observation: NH FITN voters sometimes react very badly to natl media seeming to declare who they will/won't vote for in final days.
mckaycoppins	696330130533322752	2016-02-07T13:50:14	Me too. 
mckaycoppins	696231834263359488	2016-02-07T07:19:39	And with that parting bit of punditry, I bid you all a good night.
mckaycoppins	696231727165911042	2016-02-07T07:19:13	In closing, I'll just say I find it extremely amusing to see the "Bush 45" campaign talk about how *Rubio* was expecting a coronation.

mckaycoppins	696229163250933760	2016-02-07T07:09:02	katherinemiller BenjySarlin yeah Kasich may rise. Just seems like he'll need to make a pretty convincing statement to raise enough money
mckaycoppins	696227704341991424	2016-02-07T07:03:14	Best thing Rubio has going for him. It's a high bar for them to make it past NH for long.  
mckaycoppins	696228209038385152	2016-02-07T07:05:14	BenjySarlin Jeb's the only one w/ the money to do it. Kasich &amp; Christie would have to seriously overperform to get the kind of $ they need
mckaycoppins	696227731424571392	2016-02-07T07:03:21	.mckaycoppins Meanwhile Trump and (more importantly) Cruz delight. Nobody talking about Trump losing exchange w/Jeb and getting booed.
mckaycoppins	696226827489144833	2016-02-07T06:59:45	Even if Rubio's support totally collapses in the next three days (it won't), there will still only be like 9 or 10 points up for grabs.
mckaycoppins	696226122644779009	2016-02-07T06:56:57	Bush, Christie &amp; Kasich camps are all celebrating Rubio's meltdown tonight. Thing is, it's not clear how much any of them necessarily gained

mckaycoppins	696216761734193152	2016-02-07T06:19:45	Good point by IshYimini 
mckaycoppins	696215182238969856	2016-02-07T06:13:29	Problem for Rubio is that a lot of Republican voters likely came away tonight with the same impression.

mckaycoppins	696192349651730432	2016-02-07T04:42:45	katiepack "preposterous" that he got flustered and retreated repeatedly to the same snippet of rhetoric to try to regain his balance?

mckaycoppins	696190026779119616	2016-02-07T04:33:31	Rubio's ascent has been powered by his soaring rhetoric &amp; talent as orator. Tonight, it (briefly) turned against him

mckaycoppins	696167251637100546	2016-02-07T03:03:01	katiepack no way. Rubio's repeated *exact same line* about Obama *four times* in this debate! No other candidate came close to doing that

mckaycoppins	696164253208834048	2016-02-07T02:51:06	Kasich's hyper-aggressive good-naturedness comes off as so weird to me, but a lot of people really like it.
mckaycoppins	696163987671662593	2016-02-07T02:50:03	"Thank you very much for listening, and for being patient with all of us tonight!" a jolly, belly-laughing John Kasich tells TV viewers.

mckaycoppins	696156863134633984	2016-02-07T02:21:44	Rubio obvs not saying Obama's hyper-competent, or that he's an effective manager. He's saying Obama is aggressively pursuing a clear agenda.
mckaycoppins	696156429825216512	2016-02-07T02:20:01	Christie, like Trump before him, is pretty deliberately misinterpreting Rubio's line about how Obama "knows exactly what he's doing."

mckaycoppins	696150033616498688	2016-02-07T01:54:36	Rubio is arguing that the legislation he spent years trying to advance was obviously doomed from the start?

mckaycoppins	696144981065601024	2016-02-07T01:34:31	Wow, Rubio is now delivering the same line for a third, and then fourth time. This is... bizarre.
mckaycoppins	696144703482363904	2016-02-07T01:33:25	Wow, Christie really going after Rubio. "The memorized 30-second speech... doesn’t solve one problem for one person."
mckaycoppins	696144499056181248	2016-02-07T01:32:36	Wait, did Rubio literally just deliver the exact same line twice within like 4 minutes?
