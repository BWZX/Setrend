SenWarren	726168217996148738	2016-04-29T21:56:09	Boston isn't waiting for Congress to step up &amp; make debt-free college a reality. Great work, marty_walsh! 
SenWarren	725800202720915456	2016-04-28T21:33:47	Today I went to the Senate floor to ask the SenateGOP: Where’s your plan to fund the Zika emergency response? 
SenWarren	725799993530028032	2016-04-28T21:32:57	Now we have a real, genuine health crisis in America — the Zika virus — and the SenateGOP have done nothing but get ready for vacation.
SenWarren	725799776286040070	2016-04-28T21:32:06	Republicans won control of the Senate in 2014 in part by terrifying people w/ totally made-up stories about the Ebola virus. Zika
SenWarren	724387882664906752	2016-04-25T00:01:44	I'm glad to join strong women like ones on our ussoccer USWNT to fight for equal pay - in offices, factories, &amp; yes, on the soccer field.

SenWarren	723167389630631936	2016-04-21T15:11:56	Read my letter to Chair Mary Jo White about my serious concerns with the SEC: 
SenWarren	723167283615391744	2016-04-21T15:11:30	This decision is a mockery of the SEC's core mission &amp; the latest example of the SEC failing to punish guilty parties &amp; protect investors.
SenWarren	723167178980093953	2016-04-21T15:11:05	Just 2 months after Cohen's sanction, the SEC approved the application of a new investment firm co-owned by… Steven Cohen. Seriously.
SenWarren	723167074114105345	2016-04-21T15:10:40	SAC Capital pled guilty to insider trading in 2013. In Jan, the SEC barred its manager Steven Cohen from managing outside funds until 2018.
SenWarren	722855117347643393	2016-04-20T18:31:04	Wall St broke our economy — not Central States Pension Fund workers. USTreasury should reject their pension cuts. 
SenWarren	722854921775632384	2016-04-20T18:30:18	In 2008, Wall Street got a bailout. What did those truck drivers, dockworkers &amp; warehouse workers get? They got stuck with bill.
SenWarren	722854821720502272	2016-04-20T18:29:54	Goldman Sachs &amp; Northern Trust got $41M to manage workers’ pension funds, &amp; they recklessly gambled it on junk bonds &amp; toxic mortgages.

SenWarren	721050726454149120	2016-04-15T19:01:04	We have a simple ask this OneBostonDay: Do something nice for someone today. Those are Boston values, &amp; those are American values.
SenWarren	721050570572886016	2016-04-15T19:00:27	Today we remember the victims &amp; survivors of the Boston Marathon tragedy &amp; the strength of the people of Boston by celebrating OneBostonDay
SenWarren	720737704535830529	2016-04-14T22:17:14	It’s time for the SenateGOP to doyourjob &amp; hold hearings, consider his nomination in good faith, &amp; give Judge Garland an up-or-down vote.
SenWarren	720737533072646144	2016-04-14T22:16:33	Pleased to meet today with Chief Judge Garland, POTUS’s impressive nominee to serve on the Supreme Court. 
SenWarren	720722467258515456	2016-04-14T21:16:41	That’s the definition of “unbelievable” in the real world – but it’s business as usual in the cozy world of Wall Street.
SenWarren	720722351722205184	2016-04-14T21:16:13	“Unbelievable”? Yes, totally unbelievable that JPM could get tagged as TBTF &amp; then pat each other on the backs &amp; say “heckuva job.”
SenWarren	720722230070616064	2016-04-14T21:15:44	Federal regulators said this week that JPMorgan is still Too Big to Fail. CEO Jamie Dimon's reaction?

SenWarren	720355914264367106	2016-04-13T21:00:08	Today, our top regulators warned us about the danger of the biggest banks. We would be foolish to ignore their warnings.
SenWarren	720355782038978560	2016-04-13T20:59:36	This is a giant warning sign of the central role big banks will play in the next crisis unless Congress &amp; regulators show some backbone.
SenWarren	720355600866025472	2016-04-13T20:58:53	No execs lost their jobs in exchange for taxpayer rescue. None went to jail. Some, like Jamie Dimon, are still running the same banks.
SenWarren	720355409978994688	2016-04-13T20:58:07	Big bank execs got rich but when it all predictably blew up, the gov lavished their institutions with billions in bailouts.
SenWarren	720355246979952642	2016-04-13T20:57:29	The big banks spread risk throughout the system by misleading investors about the quality of mortgages in the securities they were offering.
SenWarren	720355066331340801	2016-04-13T20:56:46	There would be no crisis without these giant banks that encouraged reckless mortgage lending &amp; funded slimy subprime lenders.
SenWarren	720354926568677377	2016-04-13T20:56:12	Wall St lobbyists have tried to deflect blame for the 2008 crisis for years. But their revisionist history is untrue &amp; dangerous.
SenWarren	720354768409927685	2016-04-13T20:55:34	Unless the banks promptly address regulators’ concerns, the gov must push these banks to get smaller &amp; less complex.
SenWarren	720354561408528384	2016-04-13T20:54:45	5 US banks are big enough that any one could crash the economy again if they failed &amp; weren’t bailed out. It’s a very big deal. It’s scary.
SenWarren	720354414830047236	2016-04-13T20:54:10	Today, after an extensive review, fed regulators concluded that 5 of the biggest banks are still Too Big to Fail. 
SenWarren	720320828508741632	2016-04-13T18:40:43	The Tax Filing Simplification Act is a commonsense bill to push the IRS to simplify Tax Day. Learn more: 
SenWarren	720320729753866240	2016-04-13T18:40:19	And the Tax Filing Simplification Act provides a return-free option for those with simple tax situations.
SenWarren	720320615199023104	2016-04-13T18:39:52	The Tax Filing Simplification Act lets taxpayers download third-party-reported tax information that the IRS already has.
SenWarren	720320514514792448	2016-04-13T18:39:28	It prohibits the IRS from entering into agreements w/ tax prep companies that restrict its ability to provide free online services.
SenWarren	720320427650723840	2016-04-13T18:39:07	My bill directs the IRS to develop a free, online tax prep &amp; filing service that taxpayers can use directly w/ the gov.
SenWarren	720320321316724737	2016-04-13T18:38:42	Today I introduced the Tax Filing Simplification Act to help taxpayers file with less stress &amp; fewer costs.
SenWarren	720320172116934656	2016-04-13T18:38:06	Congress should be making it easier for Americans to file their taxes, not bowing to the interests of the tax prep industry.
SenWarren	720320093637337092	2016-04-13T18:37:47	This year, taxpayers will spend an average of 13 hrs prepping taxes &amp; pay $200 for tax prep services.
SenWarren	720273512212992001	2016-04-13T15:32:42	Read my office’s new report on how the IRS caved to powerful companies w/ a vested interest in complicated taxes: 
SenWarren	720273402523586560	2016-04-13T15:32:15	That means taxpayers have to spend billions – and share personal info with 3rd-parties – just to file taxes.
SenWarren	720273352749756416	2016-04-13T15:32:03	The tax prep industry has fought zealously to block the IRS from implementing laws to make tax prep &amp; filing easier.
SenWarren	719991513665691648	2016-04-12T20:52:08	We recognize EqualPayDay - &amp; we fight so we don’t have to recognize it again. Watch: 
SenWarren	719991365174734853	2016-04-12T20:51:32	EqualPayDay isn’t a national day of celebration. It’s a national day of embarrassment.
SenWarren	719991259725697024	2016-04-12T20:51:07	I cannot believe we’re still standing here debating whether a woman should get fired for asking what the guy down the hall makes.
SenWarren	719991169221070850	2016-04-12T20:50:46	Today is EqualPayDay – and I cannot believe I have to give another speech fighting for equal pay for equal work for women.
SenWarren	719912007869276162	2016-04-12T15:36:12	Friday is OneBostonDay. What random acts of kindness will you do to celebrate?

SenWarren	709516397492244480	2016-03-14T23:07:45	Watch my new floor speech about JohnKingatED’s nomination &amp; the state of usedgov: 
SenWarren	709516159280914432	2016-03-14T23:06:49	.JohnKingatED didn’t create these problems at usedgov – but he has a lot of work to do to get the Dept’s higher ed house in order.
SenWarren	709516041416736769	2016-03-14T23:06:21	Secretary of Ed is one of the toughest jobs, because for yrs usedgov has put student loan companies &amp; for-profit colleges before students.
SenWarren	709515925838565378	2016-03-14T23:05:53	The Senate just voted to confirm JohnKingatED to be the next Secretary of Education – one of the most important jobs in DC.

SenWarren	708426837576306688	2016-03-11T22:58:14	Today, the CFTC withdrew the advisory committee’s report: 
SenWarren	708426718709735425	2016-03-11T22:57:46	Two weeks ago, I tweeted about a CFTC advisory committee report written by industry insiders. 
SenWarren	707719868347523072	2016-03-10T00:09:00	.ElizabethBanks isn't from District 12 or the Capitol, she's from Pittsfield! Great to see her (&amp; Americans4Arts).

SenWarren	707679034474422272	2016-03-09T21:26:44	The game's over. If Senate_GOPs want to stand up to extremist candidates, they can start by standing up to extremists in the Senate.
SenWarren	707678895114489856	2016-03-09T21:26:11	.Senate_GOPs want to play it both ways: rejecting POTUS’s legitimacy and crippling the govt while claiming Rs can govern responsibly.
SenWarren	707678795793301505	2016-03-09T21:25:47	At the same time they’re blocking any SCOTUS nominee, Senate_GOPs are in a panic that their party will nominate an extremist for President.
SenWarren	707340421962321920	2016-03-08T23:01:13	Glad to intro RepJoeKennedy's bill in the Sen to strengthen accountability &amp; give consumers better tools for info.

SenWarren	706890399034556416	2016-03-07T17:12:59	Any conversation about tackling poverty in the US should include protecting &amp; expanding Social Security.
SenWarren	705846425024864256	2016-03-04T20:04:36	The CFPB should move soon &amp; robustly on its new rules for payday lenders. No delays, and no carve-outs.
SenWarren	705846314307874816	2016-03-04T20:04:09	The CFPB is doing a great job to crack down on the tricks &amp; traps in payday loans. Congress should back the CFPB, not sabotage it.
SenWarren	705846200201777152	2016-03-04T20:03:42	Until the CFPB, no federal agency was responsible for overseeing payday lenders, who can stick vulnerable people with rates up to 400%.
SenWarren	705846103061700608	2016-03-04T20:03:19	2.5 million households borrow from payday lenders each year, with more storefronts in the US than McDonald’s and Starbucks combined.
SenWarren	704344668537024512	2016-02-29T16:37:09	FMLA was a huge step fwd, and we must do more. Read my BostonGlobe op-ed on how to level the playing field: 
SenWarren	702967221199446018	2016-02-25T21:23:40	We need real agency reform to level the playing field - not to give lobbyists more chances to block outcomes they don’t like.
SenWarren	702967073765498880	2016-02-25T21:23:05	Read my letter to CTFC Commissioner Giancarlo, calling on him to withdraw this report: 
SenWarren	702966936418836481	2016-02-25T21:22:32	The CFTC committee’s report is little more than a recitation of industry talking points and should be treated as such.
SenWarren	702966841631744004	2016-02-25T21:22:10	The CFTC report is riddled w/ problems &amp; mischaracterizations, &amp; adopted without public discussion or public vote.
SenWarren	702966653793996801	2016-02-25T21:21:25	The advisory committee behind this compromised CFTC report consists almost entire of industry insiders – violating Dodd-Frank.
SenWarren	702966566011453441	2016-02-25T21:21:04	Today that advisory committee presented a final report that is critical of the CFTC’s proposed rule on commodities futures &amp; swaps.
SenWarren	702966470167371776	2016-02-25T21:20:41	Under Dodd-Frank, Congress directed the CFTC to establish the EEMAC – an advisory committee for diverse views on CFTC actions.
SenWarren	702939688403902464	2016-02-25T19:34:16	Today I joined the SenateDems at the Supreme Court to tell the GOP: DoYourJob on a SCOTUS nominee. 
SenWarren	702897470678966273	2016-02-25T16:46:30	Medical experts agree: Whatever you think of medical marijuana, it's  irresponsible not to study the science:  
SenWarren	702897334561206276	2016-02-25T16:45:58	Serious medical research on medical marijuana is largely blocked by outdated federal laws &amp; policies.
SenWarren	702897277116010500	2016-02-25T16:45:44	Medical marijuana might be a viable alternative to opioids for pain treatment, but truthfully, there's a lot we just don't know.
SenWarren	702628783438897153	2016-02-24T22:58:50	Partial fill policies for opioids can help reduce the number of unused pills in circulation. Watch:  partialfillbill

SenWarren	698880741367635970	2016-02-14T14:45:27	Abandoning their Senate duties would also prove that all the Republican talk about loving the Constitution is just that – empty talk.
SenWarren	698880648614846464	2016-02-14T14:45:05	The Senate GOP took an oath just like Dems did. Abandoning the duties they swore to uphold threatens the Constitution &amp; our democracy.
SenWarren	698880570843992064	2016-02-14T14:44:47	I can’t find a clause in the Constitution that says “…except when there’s a year left in the term of a Democratic President.”
SenWarren	698880525377753089	2016-02-14T14:44:36	Art II Sec 2 of the Constitution says the President nominates Supreme Court justices with the advice &amp; consent of the Senate.
SenWarren	698880441638518785	2016-02-14T14:44:16	.SenateMajLdr is right that Americans should have a voice in selecting the next SCOTUS justice. In fact, they did: when POTUS won in 2012.
SenWarren	698880374332469248	2016-02-14T14:44:00	The sudden death of Justice Scalia creates an immediate vacancy on the most important court in the United States.
SenWarren	697868732291489792	2016-02-11T19:44:06	.RepCummings &amp; I sent a letter to USDOL about advisors’ wildly conflicting messages on a conflict of interest rule 
SenWarren	697868454280437760	2016-02-11T19:42:59	But when these retirement advisors talk to their own stockholders, the doomsday predictions disappear &amp; the companies say they’ll be fine.
SenWarren	697868376350314496	2016-02-11T19:42:41	Financial companies have predicted dire consequences from a new rule requiring them to act in customers’ best interests.
SenWarren	697146443459620869	2016-02-09T19:53:59	I won't support more "innovation" proposals until we have a bipartisan agreement to strengthen US_FDA &amp; seriously fund medical research.
SenWarren	697146349301714946	2016-02-09T19:53:36	Watch my remarks to the HELP Committee today on why Congress needs to commit to funding medical research: 
SenWarren	697146285539921920	2016-02-09T19:53:21	Heading into an election, it'd be easy for Congress to pass some small bills, declare victory &amp; quit. But that's not good enough.
SenWarren	697146199745368066	2016-02-09T19:53:01	Last yr, newtgingrich said ignoring this NIH funding problem “takes a special kind of stupidity that is reserved for this city.” I agree.
SenWarren	697146116752728067	2016-02-09T19:52:41	Big medical breakthroughs come from basic research. Instead of funding that research, Congress has spent a decade choking off support.
SenWarren	697146051459993601	2016-02-09T19:52:25	The Senate HELP Committee approved bills today to advance US medical innovation. I voted for those bills - but it isn't enough.
SenWarren	695686214339448832	2016-02-05T19:11:33	On FMLA23, we remember how much more we need to do to level the playing field for workers &amp; families.

SenWarren	695350196834693121	2016-02-04T20:56:20	If we want strong enforcement, personnel is policy. Read Commissioner Bowen’s call for tougher Wall St enforcement: 
SenWarren	695326631100080128	2016-02-04T19:22:42	Every single House Republican who came to work today just voted to make it harder to hold big banks accountable for fraud. Shameful.
SenWarren	695275461560115201	2016-02-04T15:59:22	Tell Congress: They work for the American people — not Wall Street banks that break the law. Vote NO on HR 766.
SenWarren	695275358568988672	2016-02-04T15:58:57	You read that right: The House is just minutes away from voting on a bill to make it tougher to investigate &amp; prosecute bank fraud.
SenWarren	695275281339256832	2016-02-04T15:58:39	Nope — right now on the House floor, Wall St buddies are pushing a bill to make it tougher to prosecute bank fraud.
SenWarren	695275206055690240	2016-02-04T15:58:21	You’d think big banks would be happy with enforcement so tepid that they could just bake fines into the cost of doing business, right?
SenWarren	695275133527814144	2016-02-04T15:58:04	Systematic fraud on Wall St helped spark the 2008 financial crisis – but not a single Wall St executive went to jail.
SenWarren	694950144115105792	2016-02-03T18:26:40	If anyone in Congress thinks they can make it harder to crack down on corporate criminals, I promise you: The American people are watching.
SenWarren	694950018155962368	2016-02-03T18:26:10	Today I spoke on the Senate floor about our rigged justice system for the rich &amp; powerful. Watch: 
SenWarren	694949760541835264	2016-02-03T18:25:09	The American people remember who broke our economy &amp; who made out like bandits – and they didn’t send us here to help the bandits.
SenWarren	694949659001888769	2016-02-03T18:24:44	Want to see the rigged game in action? Tomorrow, the House will vote on a GOP bill to make it harder to investigate &amp; prosecute bank fraud.
SenWarren	694949568644042752	2016-02-03T18:24:23	It’s not equal justice when a kid gets thrown in jail for stealing a car, while a CEO gets a huge raise when his company steals billions.
SenWarren	694949479489880064	2016-02-03T18:24:02	We have one set of law on the books, but two legal systems: One for the rich &amp; powerful, and one for everyone else.
SenWarren	694899743525376001	2016-02-03T15:06:24	Heading to the Senate floor now to discuss my enforcement report &amp; GOP efforts to weaken Wall St accountability: 
SenWarren	694677825727520769	2016-02-03T00:24:34	Today I urged Congress to reject the TPP deal before it makes things even worse for America’s families: 
SenWarren	694677679975456768	2016-02-03T00:24:00	Congress will have to vote straight up or down on TPP.  We won’t have a chance to strip out any of the worst provisions, like ISDS.
SenWarren	694677599881031680	2016-02-03T00:23:40	A rigged process produces a rigged outcome. Evidence of this tilt can be seen in a key TPP provision: ISDS.
SenWarren	694677446906413056	2016-02-03T00:23:04	12 countries will sign the TPP trade deal on Thursday - but it won't go into effect unless Congress approves it.
SenWarren	694292056081039361	2016-02-01T22:51:40	Today I asked the Senate GOP: If you won't support InTheRed, then what's your plan for student loan debt? 
SenWarren	694249006189379584	2016-02-01T20:00:36	Thanks everyone for coming to our Springfield open house today! I'm happy to fight for Western MA in the Senate. 
SenWarren	693097354140975104	2016-01-29T15:44:21	The next president can honor the simple notion that nobody is above the law, but it will happen only if voters demand it.
SenWarren	693097203053809665	2016-01-29T15:43:44	Read my new nytimes op-ed about how personnel is policy for enforcing federal laws: 
SenWarren	693097079388921856	2016-01-29T15:43:15	Today my office released a report on 20 of the worst federal enforcement failures in 2015: 
SenWarren	693096940964286468	2016-01-29T15:42:42	Presidents don’t control most day-to-day enforcement decisions, but they do nominate heads of agencies. That makes all the difference.
SenWarren	693096865856933888	2016-01-29T15:42:24	Much of the attention on DC focuses on enacting laws, but a law that's not enforced may as well not even be a law at all.
SenWarren	693096807602229248	2016-01-29T15:42:10	2016 candidates are pitching their legislative agendas, but voters should consider what presidents can do without Congress.
SenWarren	692819738213359617	2016-01-28T21:21:12	Today we remember Framingham’s Christa McAuliffe &amp; the astronauts we lost 30 yrs ago on Challenger:

SenWarren	690271950162300928	2016-01-21T20:37:12	This Congress doesn’t lack workable ideas for how to root out the influence of money in politics; it just lacks the spine to do them.
SenWarren	690271882252279809	2016-01-21T20:36:56	Here’s a whole list of things Congress could do if we had the courage to stand up to the super-wealthy few: 
SenWarren	690271729478950912	2016-01-21T20:36:19	We can – and we should – blame the Supreme Court for CitizensUnited. But that is no excuse for doing nothing.
SenWarren	690271647786504192	2016-01-21T20:36:00	Money floods our political system, letting a handful of billionaires shape who gets into Congress &amp; may decide who sits in the White House.
SenWarren	690271570590310400	2016-01-21T20:35:41	Six years ago today, CitizensUnited turned loose a flood of hidden money that is about to drown our democracy.
SenWarren	690195174518059009	2016-01-21T15:32:07	Consumers need a central place to turn to for help when they are denied coverage for mental health care. Watch:

SenWarren	685235624325066752	2016-01-07T23:04:38	This KeystoneXL lawsuit shows: ISDS was a bad idea for NAFTA, and it’s a bad idea for TPP.

SenWarren	684193879407628288	2016-01-05T02:05:07	Gun violence is an epidemic. But day after day, tragedy after tragedy, the GOP has blocked even the smallest steps to stopgunviolence.

SenWarren	674343014995763200	2015-12-08T21:41:18	The opioid epidemic is a public health crisis. We need smart ideas to solve it, like GloucesterPD’s work to treat addiction w/o arrests.

SenWarren	672849673149894656	2015-12-04T18:47:17	Wall St lobbyists know they can't roll back financial regulations out in the public, so they tack them onto must-pass pieces of legislation.
