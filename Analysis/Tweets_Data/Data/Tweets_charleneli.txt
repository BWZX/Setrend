charleneli	705482812380614656	2016-03-03T19:59:44	jhonig1 lauren Exception is mobile phone video -- which is why I like snapchat video formats. Unique POV trumps production.  esnchat
charleneli	705482548684660736	2016-03-03T19:58:41	When working w/leaders, I ask them to focus on stories they want to share, not the technology. It's what they know.  esnchat
charleneli	705482201073360896	2016-03-03T19:57:18	A fav response from leader was that ESNs allowed her to bend time &amp; space, connect at scale &amp; depth.  esnchat

charleneli	705481016123777024	2016-03-03T19:52:36	chriscatania Couldn't agree more -- this isn't about being social, it's about being a leader.  esnchat
charleneli	705480886007889921	2016-03-03T19:52:05	A5. Leaders will hold self-help sessions to help laggard colleagues - otherwise won't admit they don't know how to engage.  esnchat
charleneli	705480423967739906	2016-03-03T19:50:14	A5. When hiring/promoting, ability to foster social/digital engagement will become an evaluation criteria.  esnchat
charleneli	705479665624948736	2016-03-03T19:47:14	A5. Engaged leaders become a competitive advantage when hiring/selling, and thus something evaluated for promotions. esnchat
charleneli	705479349240070144	2016-03-03T19:45:58	A5. Attention is shortening. Create snapchat-like stories, especially short videos that provide a window into their day. esnchat
charleneli	705479100593475584	2016-03-03T19:44:59	A4. Make sure that the leader's communications team is trained and can support new digital engagement.  esnchat
charleneli	705478284885299200	2016-03-03T19:41:44	A4. Set up a custom listening tool for leaders, so they listen well, and get inspiration for commenting, writing posts.  esnchat
charleneli	705478024720982017	2016-03-03T19:40:42	A4. Provide light training on the language of community engagement - it's different from leadership language.  esnchat
charleneli	705477527800717312	2016-03-03T19:38:44	A4. Ask leaders to share a story that they think will help people take action. Cuz people remember and re-tell stories. esnchat
charleneli	705477121062412288	2016-03-03T19:37:07	A4. Community managers should know the hot button issues for EACH leader. They are not all the same.  esnchat
charleneli	705476987318624256	2016-03-03T19:36:35	A4. Posing questions for leaders to answer reduces the burden. So Q&amp;As, town halls, chat videos are all great content formats. esnchat
charleneli	705476760356438016	2016-03-03T19:35:41	A4. Create a safe space for their first forays. Success breeds engagement.  esnchat
charleneli	705475915724279808	2016-03-03T19:32:20	As leaders grow more confident, they can then venture out on their own. Leadership engagement is as much about building confidence esnchat
charleneli	705475764314054656	2016-03-03T19:31:43	A3. Love the town hall format, very easy for leaders to show up and have "contained" engagement. esnchat
charleneli	705475523019988992	2016-03-03T19:30:46	A3. Randomly commenting on posts, especially when people are being critical. Showing concern and empathy in the process. esnchat
charleneli	705475113123184640	2016-03-03T19:29:08	A3. Leaders walk into meetings asking the team, "What did you think about that discussion on the ESN earlier today?" esnchat
charleneli	705474717185150977	2016-03-03T19:27:34	A3: My favs DavidThodey &amp;Andy_Penn Telstra creating culture of employee engagement via their ESN esnchat
charleneli	705474405007278082	2016-03-03T19:26:19	JeffKRoss wazzr Humana Very interesting! Is this sense of belong based on their actual engagement on the ESN? esnchat
charleneli	705473248113336320	2016-03-03T19:21:44	carrieyoung brendaricksmith Watercooler alone is enough - what insights do you expect from it? Then measure the insights.  esnchat
charleneli	705472933767020544	2016-03-03T19:20:29	sharonlinapearc LOL. Social can be a time waster, but only if you don't have intent and strategy behind your actions.  esnchat
charleneli	705472691722186754	2016-03-03T19:19:31	A2: Barrier is not tying digital engagement to one of the leader's top goals/objectives. Needs to be purpose driven. esnchat
charleneli	705472535555645442	2016-03-03T19:18:54	thegaspar Proving ROI is the end goal, but simply typing engagement to a key objective/initiative is a good start. esnchat
charleneli	705472322841546752	2016-03-03T19:18:03	chriscatania So agreed -- they need to feel supported, not left out in the digital wilderness on their own.  esnchat
charleneli	705472102707699712	2016-03-03T19:17:10	A2. Some say "No one wants to hear about my lunch." I agree. What they really want to know is what you talked about over lunch. esnchat
charleneli	705471780157300741	2016-03-03T19:15:54	A2. Biggest barrier they *say* is time. But it's really fear of looking like a fool.  esnchat
charleneli	705471616541597696	2016-03-03T19:15:15	ann_halvorsen I've seen hyper active leaders actually freeze out engagement -- they need to know when to sit back too.  esnchat
charleneli	705471441743949826	2016-03-03T19:14:33	A1. What's at stake: the ability of your organization being able to think and act faster than real time.  esnchat
charleneli	705471299674644480	2016-03-03T19:13:59	A1. Once middle managers see their roles as facilitators, not gatekeepers, they begin to support ESNs mindsetShift esnchat
charleneli	705470819942666240	2016-03-03T19:12:05	A1: Once our CEO used ESN he said employees in the elevator could relate and talk to him. Instead of staring down at the floor. esnchat
charleneli	705470530019827712	2016-03-03T19:10:56	inklusiv Interesting take on keeping middle managers in the mix, accountable. They often are the biggest barriers to ESNs. esnchat
charleneli	705470266407784450	2016-03-03T19:09:53	thegaspar Love that informality, the give and take between leaders &amp; employees, breaks down the power distance. esnchat

charleneli	705469947321978885	2016-03-03T19:08:37	A1. 2/2 The credibility of your leadership is at stake - you can't ask people to engage in ESNs if you don't yourself.  esnchat
charleneli	705469706371735553	2016-03-03T19:07:39	A1. 1/2 ESNs can be the lifeblood of the company - but only if leaders bless it w/their presence &amp; engagement. esnchat
