BklynMiddleton	725142746181341184	2016-04-27T02:01:17	aafmuller Birthday today?!
BklynMiddleton	725141836868759552	2016-04-27T01:57:41	aafmuller I don't think so but notion that states (especially after executing a CW attack!) should self-inspect is really insane
BklynMiddleton	725140421081444352	2016-04-27T01:52:03	aafmuller Here is one 
BklynMiddleton	725139693776605184	2016-04-27T01:49:10	aafmuller And they really never weren't. Israel almost immediately warned Assad did not report all CWs. I'll find the report &amp; send later.
BklynMiddleton	725139402259726336	2016-04-27T01:48:00	BklynMiddleton not much offends my humanity more than the use of children in war.
BklynMiddleton	725138996792270848	2016-04-27T01:46:23	aafmuller I hope they would. Can't stomach thought of another Ghota regardless of whether target is regime or rebels.
BklynMiddleton	725138711667724289	2016-04-27T01:45:15	aafmuller I think they may thwart such an attack if it appeared imminent (even if it isn't targeting Israel)
BklynMiddleton	725138589420519425	2016-04-27T01:44:46	aafmuller I really do not know the answer but that report made it seem like they're sure trying.
BklynMiddleton	725138106794516480	2016-04-27T01:42:51	aafmuller You mean do they have the munitions needed? I think it would depend on the CW in question but it looks like they're testing.
BklynMiddleton	725137553477767169	2016-04-27T01:40:39	That report indicates the CWs were not manufactured by the group but were seized from Assad's arsenal... Which was, you know, destroyed.

BklynMiddleton	718996207419465728	2016-04-10T02:57:08	Man, people in my mentions absolutely lost their shit when I merely noted  it is anti-Semitic to say Jews control the banks. Alarming.
BklynMiddleton	718995749871218688	2016-04-10T02:55:19	djsmallchange I'm attacking the guy who said Jews control the banks &amp; Bernie's failure to call that out as pure anti-semitism.
BklynMiddleton	718995125540667392	2016-04-10T02:52:50	djsmallchange TerrinaMajnoona You need to read what the guy said to Bernie before you come at me like this; it was fucking anti semitic.
BklynMiddleton	718994841519144961	2016-04-10T02:51:43	JanvierNoir Thank you for talking to me like this. I know it might sound insincere over writing but I do mean that.
BklynMiddleton	718994588653002752	2016-04-10T02:50:42	DeusExJuice None have encountered anti-semitism like that! I would expect them to!
BklynMiddleton	718994497699463169	2016-04-10T02:50:21	djsmallchange TerrinaMajnoona Pure anti-semitism is saying Jews control the banks. Why deflect from that?
BklynMiddleton	718994229515722753	2016-04-10T02:49:17	JanvierNoir Really good way to put it..
BklynMiddleton	718994077312761856	2016-04-10T02:48:40	TerrinaMajnoona Did you actually read what he man said? If you did &amp; you agree with his anti-Semitism - sad - but asking in case you didn't
BklynMiddleton	718993421290049536	2016-04-10T02:46:04	JanvierNoir Of course. No one would think one person is representative of any entire culture but certainly could represent common values
BklynMiddleton	718993306336763904	2016-04-10T02:45:37	DeusExJuice no shit. I didn't imply he didn't know it was pure anti-semitism - he did - and didn't lambast it.

BklynMiddleton	718992616180858880	2016-04-10T02:42:52	DeusExJuice the only other meaningful response is... its fucking anti-semitism to say jews control the banks.

BklynMiddleton	718988365039804416	2016-04-10T02:25:59	JanvierNoir The thought of a white woman walking up &amp; touching a Black woman's hair gives me an indescribable cringeworthy feeling.

BklynMiddleton	718983666379190272	2016-04-10T02:07:18	TheSnappyBoss observer really disagree. Wasted opportunity to call out pure anti-semitism, in my humble opinion.
