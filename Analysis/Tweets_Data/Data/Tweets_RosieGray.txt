RosieGray	703043590981705729	2016-02-26T02:27:08	easy layup for Cruz to do his "i will not apologize" spiel
RosieGray	703042837235920897	2016-02-26T02:24:08	why did Cruz pass on attacking Trump there?
RosieGray	703042510134730754	2016-02-26T02:22:50	Sen. Cruz, would you like to give your stump speech?
RosieGray	703042046185988096	2016-02-26T02:21:00	one of the ironies of this election was that it was supposed to be Marco Rubio who would attract new people to the GOP, but it's been Trump.
RosieGray	703041858683826176	2016-02-26T02:20:15	Trump: "We are building a new Republican party. A lot of new people are coming in."

RosieGray	703040353750818817	2016-02-26T02:14:16	Yes. And then Trump will sweep Super Tuesday. 
RosieGray	703039710046760960	2016-02-26T02:11:43	Is Rubio saying...Obama knows exactly what he's doing?
RosieGray	703039408727990275	2016-02-26T02:10:31	maybe someone should just quietly escort Kasich and Carson away so that we can settle in and enjoy this
