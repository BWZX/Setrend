dvespinosa	711302453962997760	2016-03-19T21:24:55	ericlonners Exactly. Seigniorage asset stems from payments mech. value.  The taxpayer owns it, not the managing agency (ECB)
dvespinosa	711302195086364672	2016-03-19T21:23:53	ericlonners Not sales -- it's a bank. Issuing equity creates liability against s.t. bill asset. Stream of profits owned by taxpayer. Simple
dvespinosa	711301155695906816	2016-03-19T21:19:45	ericlonners Base money is equity used to buy s.t. bonds.  Never repaid, unlimited supply, but stream of profits owned by shareholders.
dvespinosa	711300910626906112	2016-03-19T21:18:47	ericlonners In a slightly larger nutshell: 
dvespinosa	711300238829420544	2016-03-19T21:16:06	ericlonners Base money is a liability just like equity. The profits from it are owned by equity holder. In this case, that's the taxpayer
dvespinosa	711299868023631872	2016-03-19T21:14:38	ericlonners Any profits from base money remitted to arm of legislature (treas.). Heli's bypass, remit profits directly to taxpayer
dvespinosa	711298346682454016	2016-03-19T21:08:35	ericlonners To my knowledge, ECB remits profits to sovereign treasuries.  If not, who gets it?  I'd like some! :)
dvespinosa	711297496241156096	2016-03-19T21:05:13	ericlonners Central bank is just assigned task of managing taxpayer seigniorage asset. No monetary "magic" involved in heli drops

dvespinosa	711289485875482625	2016-03-19T20:33:23	ritwik_priya See my reply to Eric: any argument that PV rises due to heli drop being done first also applies to fiscal policy
dvespinosa	711288886194900992	2016-03-19T20:31:00	ericlonners GeertNoels No different than fiscal deficit spend. Heli argument boils down to institutions: bypassing the legislature
