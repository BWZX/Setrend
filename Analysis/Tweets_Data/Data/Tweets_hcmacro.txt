hcmacro	685118269443948545	2016-01-07T15:18:18	BisphamGreen CausticPop it'd be a bad statement, market uncomfortable with reserve burn
hcmacro	685117875389095936	2016-01-07T15:16:45	BisphamGreen b/c ppl latch on to it as sign of policy slippage and so it still influences expectations, warranted or not
hcmacro	685117399218155520	2016-01-07T15:14:51	BisphamGreen you mean why protect the latter?
