petenajarian	714452078748418049	2016-03-28T14:00:24	Only if WR is the pick is it limited, my point was take the best player rated at #23,  
petenajarian	714446597090836480	2016-03-28T13:38:37	yup,although I would say,always! Great example, Detroit for years drafts for position needs,has not served them well 
petenajarian	714445938127990784	2016-03-28T13:36:00	Sure, but no matter what, it should be the best player at that moment following pick #22.... 
petenajarian	714444879347187712	2016-03-28T13:31:47	We should not limit our pick to WR, grab the best rated player with 23rd pick.... FA filled needs, now grab quality.
