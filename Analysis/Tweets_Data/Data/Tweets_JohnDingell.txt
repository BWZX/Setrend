JohnDingell	704845546008113153	2016-03-02T01:47:28	So are we gonna‚Äô keep treating Rubio like an adorable little nephew who always says he wins or is that finally over?

JohnDingell	703062582823948288	2016-02-26T03:42:36	A dozen GOP debates and I've yet to hear one candidate thoughtfully discuss a serious policy.  There are only so many ways to polish a turd.
JohnDingell	703059445782290432	2016-02-26T03:30:08	Oh hell, there's a GOP debate tonight? I thought it was just the crazy guy and the robot left.

JohnDingell	697961995119804417	2016-02-12T01:54:41	I guess I'll watch this debate.
JohnDingell	697960753949761536	2016-02-12T01:49:45	Gotta say, attacking our sitting President AND a civil rights icon in the same day is one hell of a Democratic primary election strategy.
JohnDingell	697953808412839936	2016-02-12T01:22:09	No matter who you are or who you're voting for, you should honestly think twice about your choices in life if you're attacking repjohnlewis

JohnDingell	694334373731123201	2016-02-02T01:39:49	The best thing about the Iowa Caucus is that it only happens once every four years.

JohnDingell	692907522898956288	2016-01-29T03:10:01	Skipped debate, but if Twitter is any indication it sounds like the same cesspool of terrible ideas as last time.  Wake me up in November.
