DouglasCarswell	694812119926194176	2016-02-03T09:18:13	City AM on Cameron's "deal". Scathing. "No more than a press release".  If the City turns on Cameron he's in trouble
DouglasCarswell	694794696628031488	2016-02-03T08:08:58	In Cameron's choreographed Euro deal, I wonder if we will get a white rabbit at the last minute re Human Rights?

DouglasCarswell	694650526596730880	2016-02-02T22:36:06	Cameron's duff EU deal makes me sad. We once produced real leaders, not mediocrities with such a limited sense of what Britain could be
