traderstewie	701636629392289792	2016-02-22T05:16:22	Many don't realize bear markets start LONG before the indices actually roll over. The damage happens UNDER THE SURFACE slowly months before

traderstewie	701627162458083329	2016-02-22T04:38:45	@randall_q Sure. As of now, i'm treating as an OVERSOLD bounce within an on-going correction. Bounce phase can last a few weeks, so heads up

traderstewie	698364419584106497	2016-02-13T04:33:47	Bfklin it looks easy but it's by far one of the hardest dishes to cook. Practice it at least once before serving it to a swiss person
traderstewie	698363904569667584	2016-02-13T04:31:44	Keep stirring constantly until you get this consistency. Add splash of kirsch, nutmeg, salt, white pepper. taste it 
traderstewie	698355130861641729	2016-02-13T03:56:52	Add all the cheese at once, raise heat to medium, stir in a figure 8 motion for a few minutes.... patience needed 
traderstewie	698353206393372673	2016-02-13T03:49:13	Add half a teaspoon of cornstarch to the grated cheeses while the wine is slowly simmering. Slowly add cheese to pot

traderstewie	697963409430618112	2016-02-12T02:00:18	Bfklin in this case. Ground beef. But ground pork, veal combo is what most east coast Italians would prefer ;')
traderstewie	697962718607728640	2016-02-12T01:57:34	Tip: i use white pepper and nutmeg in the meatball mixture. It adds subtle heat and flavor spice without turning your mouth into a volcano
traderstewie	697961943059959809	2016-02-12T01:54:29	Tip: I like to use red wine and cognac to deglace the pan as it adds a lot more complexity and depth to an ordinary marinara sauce.
traderstewie	697961395686510592	2016-02-12T01:52:18	Key recipe tips: DO NOT use boring ass dried bread crumbs! Use day old bread, soak it in milk.. makes the meatballs much more moist

traderstewie	695123031723671553	2016-02-04T05:53:40	Biggest mistake a trader can make is argue/defend a trade or stance you made on a market/stock. At this point, you're emotionally attached
traderstewie	695122368335728640	2016-02-04T05:51:02	It'll have ZERO impact on price action, that's true BUT regardless of price action, you'll get emotionally attached
