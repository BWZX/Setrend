tmcgev	720102928829296641	2016-04-13T04:14:51	pkafka ClaraJeffery I am bracing myself!
tmcgev	720101837819486209	2016-04-13T04:10:31	ClaraJeffery only very brave bettors are not trying to sell or massively capitalize like RIGHT NOW
tmcgev	720101730898329600	2016-04-13T04:10:06	ClaraJeffery which I think is why you are seeing so many panicked layoffs and pivots and whatnot after q1
tmcgev	720101652888465408	2016-04-13T04:09:47	ClaraJeffery ... that in very short order there will be no value here for any of these players at all. So they need to get in shape to sell
tmcgev	720101540195909633	2016-04-13T04:09:20	ClaraJeffery Yep! Now, having said all that ... it is entirely possible that the direct access brands have to social networks will mean..
tmcgev	720100925868744704	2016-04-13T04:06:54	ClaraJeffery ... but Buzzfeed journalism does not! (cf mashable.) So it's also a question of defining terms.
tmcgev	720100836421079044	2016-04-13T04:06:32	ClaraJeffery But! What Buzzfeed will survive? We all think of the Smith/Shoofs stuff. There is a narrative where Buzzfeed survives ...
tmcgev	720100665192792064	2016-04-13T04:05:52	ClaraJeffery As far as who is best situated to survive, Buzzfeed has to be a top bet.
tmcgev	720100541930610688	2016-04-13T04:05:22	ClaraJeffery There is value here ... just not enough value to drive the total valuation of all of these companies put together.
tmcgev	720100400188276737	2016-04-13T04:04:48	ClaraJeffery This is everyone placing their bets on the right horses because there is not room for all of them--Vice, Buzzfeed, Vox, etc.
tmcgev	720100295477477378	2016-04-13T04:04:23	ClaraJeffery In a bubble burst everyone loses because the thing that was valued turns out to have no value.
tmcgev	720100191681036288	2016-04-13T04:03:59	ClaraJeffery One or more of these companies will come out of this victorious. There is not room for all of them though.
tmcgev	720100033966813185	2016-04-13T04:03:21	ClaraJeffery I think there is an important distinction to be made between a bottleneck and a bubble here.
tmcgev	720097195005997057	2016-04-13T03:52:04	jayrosen_nyu Well, I believe in the latter. I just think that like all religion, it has to suffer the existence of a fundamentalist wing.

tmcgev	720096513909776384	2016-04-13T03:49:22	jayrosen_nyu mtracey It's just that vanity often has a shorter runway than smart money does, in the end.
tmcgev	720096365133635585	2016-04-13T03:48:46	jayrosen_nyu mtracey All that said: I don't have a problem with what is called "vanity" publishing. It's not so different from nonprofits.
tmcgev	720094642193231872	2016-04-13T03:41:56	jayrosen_nyu mtracey Journalists are too often happy to take dumb money instead of smart money. Smart money might interfere, but ...
tmcgev	720093872064458752	2016-04-13T03:38:52	jayrosen_nyu mtracey Yep. FINALLY we have the kind of money where the inevitable embrace of such GREAT content will have time to happen.

tmcgev	720093088400715776	2016-04-13T03:35:45	5. "They want some of the energy I've had in my reporting here to supercharge the other reporters on the desk."
tmcgev	720092883643166720	2016-04-13T03:34:56	4. "They are trying to change the fact they skew so male."
tmcgev	720092782073876484	2016-04-13T03:34:32	3. "Expanding into this area may seem like a stretch for them, but if I can manage it I'll be in on the ground floor of something."

tmcgev	720092091217485824	2016-04-13T03:31:47	jayrosen_nyu mtracey ajam I do too. I suspect it is similar to yours ... but I am not baffled that they think the way they do I guess.
tmcgev	720090135300337665	2016-04-13T03:24:01	jayrosen_nyu mtracey Agreed. I don't think the theory plays out, myself.
tmcgev	720089873588297728	2016-04-13T03:22:59	jayrosen_nyu mtracey But their small audience was largely a matter of corporate cable business logistics, still--as it always is at first.
tmcgev	720089709142286336	2016-04-13T03:22:19	jayrosen_nyu mtracey Whether that is actually true would require information I don't have, which is why I don't undersign.
tmcgev	720089589617180672	2016-04-13T03:21:51	jayrosen_nyu mtracey And that they thought they had a longer timeframe to get there.
tmcgev	720089538790604800	2016-04-13T03:21:39	jayrosen_nyu mtracey It's a solid enough metric. Just saying, they do have some room to claim they weren't there yet.
tmcgev	720089012489347072	2016-04-13T03:19:33	mtracey jayrosen_nyu And leadership, rightly, praising good work from subordinates as judged against their strategies.
tmcgev	720088605163696129	2016-04-13T03:17:56	jayrosen_nyu mtracey We treat media properties too much as if the money has a "view from nowhere," to borrow a phrase. Often it's central.
tmcgev	720088447147470848	2016-04-13T03:17:19	jayrosen_nyu mtracey In general, the "success" vs "failure" matrix fails to take into account the peculiar interests the investors have.
tmcgev	720087716197703680	2016-04-13T03:14:24	jayrosen_nyu mtracey I think, not that I am endorsing, that they believe oil price volatility chopped off their runway.

tmcgev	702670204007026690	2016-02-25T01:43:26	It doesn't strike me that any journalists are trying. But campaigns definitely are.

tmcgev	702668290645217281	2016-02-25T01:35:50	Reporting on social media in politics is seldom more sophisticated than how many retweets donald trump got or how many views that ad got
