BenjySarlin	726143032744091652	2016-04-29T20:16:04	allahpundit Yeah think you're right, let me review
BenjySarlin	726142902888464384	2016-04-29T20:15:33	allahpundit Yeah? Let me take a look.
BenjySarlin	726141710187790337	2016-04-29T20:10:49	Rubio: Trump a "con artist." Perry: "Cancer on conservatism." Both now ReadyForTrump. Last walls are falling. 
BenjySarlin	726140747649523712	2016-04-29T20:06:59	It's finally happened. The GOP has reached the "acceptance" phase for Donald Trump. 
BenjySarlin	726112891162624000	2016-04-29T18:16:18	So is there actually going to be an independent GOP candidate? Not seeing much evidence so far. 
BenjySarlin	726101844183883776	2016-04-29T17:32:24	Cruz still hasn't even caught up to Rubio's total; Trump still at just 3 govs, 1 senator, 10 House members - crazy 
BenjySarlin	726086550719729664	2016-04-29T16:31:38	Amazing how many Republicans sat out endorsing anyone, let alone Trump or Cruz. Party just never decided. 
BenjySarlin	726063073249873920	2016-04-29T14:58:20	1) Ted Cruz  
BenjySarlin	726057986922307584	2016-04-29T14:38:08	Trump, Cruz aides advised Guatemalan candidate vowing televised executions

BenjySarlin	726035893601988608	2016-04-29T13:10:20	Scary thing coming from Southern Hemisphere crossing borders -- Zika is more or less made for Trump as soon as he notices it in the news
BenjySarlin	726035527758049280	2016-04-29T13:08:53	Putting a marker down: The politicized freakout over Zika in the general election is going to be bonkers

BenjySarlin	726019659582025728	2016-04-29T12:05:50	People claim to hate horse race journalism, yet when people find out what I do, 99% of the time they ask who's gonna win.
BenjySarlin	726024306879242240	2016-04-29T12:24:18	Clearly a sign Trump will put NJ in play in general right

BenjySarlin	725857173289373698	2016-04-29T01:20:10	Some recent Cruz endorsements actually strike me as last-second hedges to demonstrate this  
BenjySarlin	725850608729751552	2016-04-29T00:54:05	Except they skipped one of those steps  
BenjySarlin	725850439929987072	2016-04-29T00:53:25	Corker, Boehner, now Gregg. All officials widely considered the adults in the room within GOP picking Trump.  
BenjySarlin	725850076527136768	2016-04-29T00:51:58	This is quite a read  
BenjySarlin	725822850523893760	2016-04-28T23:03:47	Owns.  
BenjySarlin	725812217069854720	2016-04-28T22:21:32	allahpundit Obviously this is surprising to no one, right
BenjySarlin	725807456560005120	2016-04-28T22:02:37	Not that it should matter either way, but it was as far from a hit piece as it gets

BenjySarlin	725783190602944512	2016-04-28T20:26:11	The biggest story this week: Trump can lose ALL Indiana delegates and still win thanks to his yuge PA victory

BenjySarlin	725738822944755712	2016-04-28T17:29:53	Putting aside Trump/Cruz individual issues, it's just hard to imagine a party this divided winning 
BenjySarlin	725737651509297154	2016-04-28T17:25:14	"Quite frankly, I don't give a damn about the Republicans," says Bobby Knight at a Trump rally in Evansville, IN. Crowd roars.
BenjySarlin	725736450965135366	2016-04-28T17:20:28	OrrChris DouthatNYT NateSilver538 I think you're looking for a separate endless canoe about Ross' great electability column
BenjySarlin	725734408162934784	2016-04-28T17:12:21	NateSilver538 DouthatNYT And that authenticity could be bought with cheap gauzy appeals that didn't connect to ideology or policy much
BenjySarlin	725734207876567040	2016-04-28T17:11:33	NateSilver538 DouthatNYT His whole thing was that voters fall in line behind someone who projects authenticity, even if they don't agree
BenjySarlin	725734007489470464	2016-04-28T17:10:45	NateSilver538 DouthatNYT Frank also linked social issues to much more than religion -- General regional/class/social divide.
BenjySarlin	725732620399579136	2016-04-28T17:05:14	DouthatNYT NateSilver538 And that someone like say Jerry Falwell Jr endorsing Trump, Trump winning evangelicals, is perfect example
BenjySarlin	725732406523625476	2016-04-28T17:04:23	DouthatNYT NateSilver538 But another popular critique on left is that the religious angle is often a cudgel for other resentment
BenjySarlin	725732108040171521	2016-04-28T17:03:12	DouthatNYT NateSilver538 Think it's fair to say he challenges its reach, but he also doesn't push back on it, mostly ignores when possible
BenjySarlin	725731417284468736	2016-04-28T17:00:27	This amazingly became a big campaign story in a 2014 Senate race too:

BenjySarlin	725727677118713857	2016-04-28T16:45:36	NateSilver538 DouthatNYT Exactly. I don't agree with all of it, but it's a long established lefty critique Trump bolsters.

BenjySarlin	725725412962263040	2016-04-28T16:36:36	chrislhayes DouthatNYT jbarro Or even Obamacare, for that matter. Both symbols for broader unease, just as immigration is now.
BenjySarlin	725724123939373056	2016-04-28T16:31:29	DouthatNYT jbarro I always assumed ideological conservatives were large/active enough to veto this bloc, but turns out it's much larger
BenjySarlin	725723717771362305	2016-04-28T16:29:52	DouthatNYT jbarro This may fit into the racial/tribal part, but think it's also its own track
BenjySarlin	725723419178835970	2016-04-28T16:28:41	DouthatNYT jbarro Especially on entitlements and taxes on wealthy, which was papered over by cultural/anti-Obama resentment
BenjySarlin	725723270885027840	2016-04-28T16:28:05	DouthatNYT jbarro There was also a common critique though that GOP economic message was far less popular with base than assumed
BenjySarlin	725722757904891904	2016-04-28T16:26:03	jbarro DouthatNYT Just because it's not 100% what they expected doesn't mean a ton doesn't line up with common lefty critiques though
BenjySarlin	725722052007743488	2016-04-28T16:23:15	That is, I think that lots of liberals thought GOP base was too ideological to support a figure like Trump.
BenjySarlin	725721721391697920	2016-04-28T16:21:56	I'm not sure it breaks down this cleanly: 
BenjySarlin	725721797220536320	2016-04-28T16:22:14	I mean, you issued a joint press release announcing it  
BenjySarlin	725703667098243073	2016-04-28T15:10:11	Rep. Mike Kelly's office clarifies he has NOT endorsed Trump. He merely voted for him in primary and is attending pro-Trump meetings on Hill
BenjySarlin	725700849859715074	2016-04-28T14:59:00	THREE House Rs endorse realDonaldTrump today: Mike Kelly and Bill Shuster of PA, and Jeff Miller of FL
BenjySarlin	725719128401653760	2016-04-28T16:11:38	jbarro And you're not worried that Bob, the CEO's son who keep generating harassment lawsuits, is a worse alternative?
BenjySarlin	725718542545522689	2016-04-28T16:09:18	I think both of these things are a factor, fair point  
BenjySarlin	725718399339368448	2016-04-28T16:08:44	jbarro You don't think you could get over that time Steve from accounting stole your cupcake from the fridge with nuclear codes on the line
BenjySarlin	725718043805016064	2016-04-28T16:07:19	Senate For. Relations Chair Bob Corker -- BOB CORKER -- is on msnbc gushing over Trump's foreign policy. That's how much Cruz is disliked.
BenjySarlin	725715633053138944	2016-04-28T15:57:44	The level of hatred you have to generate among your colleagues to have them tacitly choose Trump almost unanimously is hard to contemplate.
BenjySarlin	725711977406828544	2016-04-28T15:43:13	Add to list that includes New York. Should start keeping track of all the general election promises... 
BenjySarlin	725694460538064897	2016-04-28T14:33:36	The amazing thing about the Trump campaign is it is the culmination of miscalculations by just about major actor in the GOP. No clean hands.
BenjySarlin	725696012841537537	2016-04-28T14:39:46	Establishment Republican foreign policy is absurd. realDonaldTrump's foreign policy is absurd in a special way 
BenjySarlin	725694842894880768	2016-04-28T14:35:07	jonlovett In general, picking one of his contradictory stances and calling it the real one is falling into trap he wants you to fall into
BenjySarlin	725694670186024960	2016-04-28T14:34:26	jonlovett I mean, he's right, it's basically Obama's position. It's just 100% the opposite of what he said earlier the same month.
BenjySarlin	725682053581262849	2016-04-28T13:44:18	Cruz has a problem with party elites, but he also has a problem with Kasich voters who really don't like what they see and refuse to budge.

BenjySarlin	725426734812696576	2016-04-27T20:49:46	Maybe if you had somehow defined him this way right out the gate, but 10 months in nobody is primed to listen to it

BenjySarlin	725394326541492225	2016-04-27T18:40:59	Maybe the lowest conceivable bar for a foreign policy speech. 
BenjySarlin	725386625576919040	2016-04-27T18:10:23	Reporting on Trump's speech as if he's never said anything else on foreign policy worth mentioning would do a disservice to everyone

BenjySarlin	725377570263330816	2016-04-27T17:34:24	Trump's prime example of America abandoning allies is Iran deal, which was negotiated in tandem with Britain, France, Germany, and the EU
BenjySarlin	725372641050124289	2016-04-27T17:14:49	My take on the Trump speech on the whole: same content, new wrapping.
BenjySarlin	725372057370923009	2016-04-27T17:12:29	I mean it. I have literally less of an idea what Trump thinks about foreign policy after this speech.
BenjySarlin	725371880908066816	2016-04-27T17:11:47	"The nations state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony," Trump said in a line that somehow hasn't appeared in rallies
BenjySarlin	725370879165624320	2016-04-27T17:07:48	Has a candidate ever run saying "Military action will by my first resort and I can't wait to do it "
BenjySarlin	725369479178403840	2016-04-27T17:02:15	Last word on today's Hastert hearing. Couldn't agree more. 
BenjySarlin	725370160345796608	2016-04-27T17:04:57	This has barely been litigated in primaries too, because opponents have similar math problem  
BenjySarlin	725369225041219584	2016-04-27T17:01:14	Let's not pretend he's been within the norm of vague politician foreign policy speeches.  
BenjySarlin	725368226591346689	2016-04-27T16:57:16	And the parts that aren't really, really, really do not sound like Trump  
BenjySarlin	725368029924708353	2016-04-27T16:56:29	I am shocked, SHOCKED, to learn that we have fewer active troops than literally the end of the Cold War in 1991
BenjySarlin	725366812615958528	2016-04-27T16:51:39	I feel like there's almost no reason writing this up. Few details, Trump clearly didn't write it, not clear if  holds past next interview.

BenjySarlin	725365246693531649	2016-04-27T16:45:26	Trump just seems to staple GOP talking points about foreign policy onto his own foreign policy, which is totally incompatible with them
BenjySarlin	725364362903343104	2016-04-27T16:41:55	After literally threatening to end alliances over a funding dispute, Trump pivots to saying our allies no longer think they can depend on us
BenjySarlin	725363224263024640	2016-04-27T16:37:23	Again, literally the name of the Charles Lindbergh isolationist group that opposed WW II  
BenjySarlin	725362804757131264	2016-04-27T16:35:43	Trump does not seem to take to teleprompters well
BenjySarlin	725362468071968768	2016-04-27T16:34:23	And here comes Trump...
BenjySarlin	725361367323054082	2016-04-27T16:30:01	There's not really anything Trump can say to become "serious" on foreign policy given the trail of positions and rhetoric he's already left
BenjySarlin	725359391092969472	2016-04-27T16:22:10	Yes 
BenjySarlin	725358098735493121	2016-04-27T16:17:01	I said last night that it was insane that Trump will be the GOP nominee. Following those RTs, this Hastert news is just as insane.
BenjySarlin	725358836308045824	2016-04-27T16:19:57	Imagine you read about another Western country whose leader took office promising ethnic bans, mass torture, killing of families?
BenjySarlin	725358632661999618	2016-04-27T16:19:09	Trump's the likely nominee. His  dashed-off calls for torture, praise for mass killings, contempt for basic human rights matter more now.
BenjySarlin	725357462279315456	2016-04-27T16:14:30	Longest serving Republican Speaker of the House in American history.  
BenjySarlin	725357042391650306	2016-04-27T16:12:50	Well then  
BenjySarlin	725355459511644160	2016-04-27T16:06:32	That list doesn't even include torture 
BenjySarlin	725347880546914304	2016-04-27T15:36:25	Unbelievable

BenjySarlin	725343282436263936	2016-04-27T15:18:09	Well, there was this poll:  
BenjySarlin	725342814142345216	2016-04-27T15:16:17	Given Cruz's own likability issues, wouldn't it make sense to pair him with someone who doesn't have same problem? 
BenjySarlin	725341976690872321	2016-04-27T15:12:58	Fiorina has a lot in common with Cruz: Relentlessly on message, rips opponents hard, and mostly unpopular outside the base
BenjySarlin	725340638372331522	2016-04-27T15:07:39	Yes please  
BenjySarlin	725329776936935428	2016-04-27T14:24:29	I have a hunch Ted Cruz is going to disruptify the race by switching to the Innovation Party.
BenjySarlin	725328007141826560	2016-04-27T14:17:27	"Announces running mate early" is another one of those great West Wing scenarios reporters pine for each cycle

BenjySarlin	725325754607628289	2016-04-27T14:08:30	Literally the only county Trump lost in the last six states was the one with Manhattan in it

BenjySarlin	725313272585428993	2016-04-27T13:18:54	Again, the reason Republicans refrained from calling for Muslim bans before Trump was not fear it would be unpopular 
BenjySarlin	725311216512434176	2016-04-27T13:10:44	I wonder if Trump team would have been able to organize their successful unbound delegate operation in PA a month ago
BenjySarlin	725146132003713024	2016-04-27T02:14:45	Trump is Christie's Tyler Durden.  
BenjySarlin	725310842892230657	2016-04-27T13:09:15	Good morning. Trump says he's the "presumptive nominee" now and he's getting pretty close 
BenjySarlin	725309540351246336	2016-04-27T13:04:04	Turnout was super low in yesterday's GOP primaries. Voters resigned to results? 
BenjySarlin	725161052317450240	2016-04-27T03:14:02	My wrap: Trump declares self "presumptive nominee." Not there yet, but getting close. 
BenjySarlin	725160790110560256	2016-04-27T03:12:59	That's big  
BenjySarlin	725160511558438913	2016-04-27T03:11:53	Ironic two candidates who held fire vs Trump for months are left to convince GOP voters he's uniquely horrific, must be stopped at all costs
BenjySarlin	725159978584023040	2016-04-27T03:09:46	ThewizardofPOS Less likely after tonight, still not impossible
BenjySarlin	725159535837483009	2016-04-27T03:08:00	Indiana now looks like last chance to push Trump off track. After that, only CA remains, and hard to see why he underperforms.
BenjySarlin	725158559974064130	2016-04-27T03:04:08	Mary Pat! 
BenjySarlin	725156816343027712	2016-04-27T02:57:12	By the way, are you following jacobsoboroff? Cause he is all over the delegate fight.
BenjySarlin	725156653969080321	2016-04-27T02:56:33	.stevekornacki reports that early indications are Trump will win at least 33 of Pennsylvania’s 54 unbound delegates.
BenjySarlin	725156393796292608	2016-04-27T02:55:31	Correct The Record got to Bernie too I guess?  
BenjySarlin	725156025909682176	2016-04-27T02:54:03	This seems like a much more defensible angle

BenjySarlin	725154977547591680	2016-04-27T02:49:54	Not all great news for super-rich guys with healthy egos. MD08 candidate David Trone spent record $12.4m of his own cash -- and lost.
BenjySarlin	725153851481804800	2016-04-27T02:45:25	pbump He wasn't even secretary of state yet!
BenjySarlin	725153730262261760	2016-04-27T02:44:56	I suspect a guy who was senator and secretary of state would probably do pretty well too
BenjySarlin	725153166300336128	2016-04-27T02:42:42	So no mention of the guy who won all five primaries with 55%+ tonight   
BenjySarlin	725152265762295809	2016-04-27T02:39:07	196 days until the election.

BenjySarlin	725150942014758916	2016-04-27T02:33:51	So here's the latest polling on Trump vs Clinton 
BenjySarlin	725150522731167746	2016-04-27T02:32:11	Again: This is higher than expectations, which were high to begin with. NBC's minimum needed for Trump was 90-95.

BenjySarlin	725144304444805120	2016-04-27T02:07:29	The pull quote from this speech is just one long rambling sentence

BenjySarlin	725141865557798913	2016-04-27T01:57:47	This is will change (and these folks are free agents), but gives you idea that Trump is performing pretty well here 
BenjySarlin	725141810620682240	2016-04-27T01:57:34	LuckyEatAnter It isn't, the story all month has been his narrow path, but he's doing what he needs to do to stay on it
BenjySarlin	725141632601870336	2016-04-27T01:56:52	So far, so Trump  
BenjySarlin	725141428607672320	2016-04-27T01:56:03	LuckyEatAnter Trump margin looks much bigger than expected, path to 1237 looking better
BenjySarlin	725140510466252800	2016-04-27T01:52:24	It’s like an inverse Bradley effect.

BenjySarlin	725135381243396096	2016-04-27T01:32:01	This is huge if it holds, gives much bigger cushion for 1,237

BenjySarlin	725134012067373056	2016-04-27T01:26:35	It's not like he had much competition from Cruz either  
BenjySarlin	725133183897853952	2016-04-27T01:23:18	So this Clinton speech sure looks like the general election
BenjySarlin	725127869664468994	2016-04-27T01:02:11	Guys, Trump is at or above 60 percent in every state so far. This is not what was expected.
BenjySarlin	725124289775591424	2016-04-27T00:47:57	This is a pretty good summary

BenjySarlin	725114992605810688	2016-04-27T00:11:00	Don't want to overstate expectations game either. The fact we've long known Trump would win these states doesn't make it less significant.
BenjySarlin	725114015312044032	2016-04-27T00:07:07	Klstok That's clear. Doesn't mean it's favorable coverage or GOP voters aren't responding to it.

BenjySarlin	723182552350109696	2016-04-21T16:12:11	ggreeneva jboxt1 That doesn't make their critique right, just not irrational or product of ignorance as it's often presented
BenjySarlin	723182363711254528	2016-04-21T16:11:26	ggreeneva jboxt1 Exactly, it's that when you talk to them they can pretty articulately explain why they feel left out by both parties
BenjySarlin	723178618415882240	2016-04-21T15:56:33	ggreeneva jboxt1 Many of the most searing indictments of Trump voters -- not Trump -- have come from anti-Trump right
BenjySarlin	723178481606078464	2016-04-21T15:56:00	ggreeneva jboxt1 I do wonder how much that piece is just that guy, but it is true that right is grappling with this absolutely the same
BenjySarlin	723176486660919296	2016-04-21T15:48:05	ggreeneva jboxt1 I probably should just write a medium post, but the more time I spend with them, the more I feel they can't be dismissed
BenjySarlin	723176182469017600	2016-04-21T15:46:52	ggreeneva jboxt1 Trump voters I meet often fit that picture. But they're also fellow Americans, not going away, and have real concerns
BenjySarlin	723176022338899968	2016-04-21T15:46:14	ggreeneva jboxt1 Idea that if you say something offensive, then you should be dismissed to Racist Island, and no point worrying about you
BenjySarlin	723175563825954816	2016-04-21T15:44:25	ggreeneva jboxt1 My concern with the "smug" angle is it curdles into assumption that you can dismiss everyone who fails these new tests
BenjySarlin	723175423383838721	2016-04-21T15:43:51	ggreeneva jboxt1 And also reckoning with how politics and culture have exploited resentment along these lines in the past and changing
BenjySarlin	723175287291260928	2016-04-21T15:43:19	ggreeneva jboxt1 But my sense is that "smug" problem stems from a good thing, which is new awareness of race, gender, LGBT etc
BenjySarlin	723174841604562944	2016-04-21T15:41:32	ggreeneva jboxt1 I'm going from perspective of guy from left-wing Manhattan enclave who talks to GOP voters all day, so different view

BenjySarlin	723154775911612416	2016-04-21T14:21:48	ggreeneva I watch it now and many of its spinoffs and it's taken the same attitude and stripped it into just mocking people they hate
BenjySarlin	723154676141666304	2016-04-21T14:21:25	ggreeneva One thing it does diagnose is bad Daily Show influence. Stewart's genius move was using the show to satirize media primarily.
BenjySarlin	723154516313550850	2016-04-21T14:20:46	ggreeneva I thought it tilted too far that direction, but hoping it gets people talking.

BenjySarlin	723153340016803841	2016-04-21T14:16:06	ggreeneva I think it's an issue that needs to be much more debated on left, though I view it through different frame than him

BenjySarlin	722438450050428929	2016-04-19T14:55:23	arzE NY hasn't had a super competitive D primary in a long time, which could also explain how it got swept under rug until now.
BenjySarlin	722437456780517376	2016-04-19T14:51:26	arzE But bear in mind some controversial rules also help Sanders a lot: Low turnout caucuses, for example, are his best races
BenjySarlin	722437242128621571	2016-04-19T14:50:35	arzE Some liberal writers (see ThePlumLineGS) have suggested Sanders use his clout to cut a deal on election reform at the convention
BenjySarlin	722437042957852672	2016-04-19T14:49:47	arzE That said, election (maybe more on GOP side than D) has exposed lot of controversial rules that went ignored in less competitive years
BenjySarlin	722436766679044099	2016-04-19T14:48:42	arzE I cover GOP side, cuz, which has same issue (Trump's own kids missed the Oct. deadline.) NY deadlines really onerous vs other states.
BenjySarlin	722432759894056960	2016-04-19T14:32:46	katedavies00 I'm confused. I meant young Sanders supporters in a general with Clinton as the nominee.
BenjySarlin	722425159148302336	2016-04-19T14:02:34	Maybe I'm wrong, but I think Sanders &amp; Warren campaigning for Clinton in the general election will fix this. 
BenjySarlin	722425621087928320	2016-04-19T14:04:24	HarrySteinDC Could easily see this going the way of the PUMAs in 08, esp. given GOP side. But why I think it may be a different situation.
BenjySarlin	722424991720022017	2016-04-19T14:01:54	katedavies00 Those odds go up the more Clinton portrayed not as the wrong nominee, but an illegitimate and corrupt one.
BenjySarlin	722424838095310848	2016-04-19T14:01:18	katedavies00 The danger is either low turnout or -- less likely but nightmare scenario -- active effort to undermine with third party votes

BenjySarlin	722423324354195456	2016-04-19T13:55:17	What makes Sanders tearing down Clinton favs worrisome for D's is many supporters are young first-time voters. No inherent loyalty to party.
BenjySarlin	722422586789994496	2016-04-19T13:52:21	mmurraypolitics And my suspicion is it has a lot to do with nature of attacks each candidate and supporters have used on D side.

BenjySarlin	719958335307403264	2016-04-12T18:40:17	It Was A Good Day:  
BenjySarlin	719943249159397378	2016-04-12T17:40:21	This probably wasn't too hard a decision  
BenjySarlin	719931566575775749	2016-04-12T16:53:55	gregsasso emmaroller Which is fine, but if it isn't accurate, it isn't accurate.
BenjySarlin	719931492965687296	2016-04-12T16:53:38	gregsasso emmaroller But I think it's more that supporters, some of whom are new to process and worried about being ripped off, egg it on
BenjySarlin	719931351517040640	2016-04-12T16:53:04	gregsasso emmaroller I think coverage that doesn't acknowledge both delegate and popular count probably should acknowledge both
BenjySarlin	719930914420166656	2016-04-12T16:51:20	emmaroller The answer: Because he hasn't won as much as her, period. Even before you touch any process issues.

BenjySarlin	719927645971083264	2016-04-12T16:38:21	emmaroller Not that it's some great system to have, just that it doesn't have much to do with why she's winning so far
BenjySarlin	719927489963958272	2016-04-12T16:37:43	emmaroller A lot of the conversation seems to hand-wave her pledged lead or, on twitter often, just outright ignore it

BenjySarlin	714977939335553027	2016-03-30T00:49:59	I don't know if this does anything to Trump in primary, but it's getting harder by the minute to imagine Trump winning general

BenjySarlin	714947266709164032	2016-03-29T22:48:06	Trump is smearing Michelle Fields now, lies that she claimed she was thrown to ground. Crowd screams: "SHE'S A LIAR" "IT WAS BULLSHIT"
BenjySarlin	714944851276656643	2016-03-29T22:38:30	So Paul Ryan was just mightily booed here in his own hometown of Janesville. Trump didn't even say anything negative about him.

BenjySarlin	714916650949218304	2016-03-29T20:46:26	Every day I talk to Trump voters, the less "He was what was on TV" makes sense as explanation. They name specific issues, it's not random.

BenjySarlin	709900940720119808	2016-03-16T00:35:48	This really feels like the start of a new phase.  
BenjySarlin	709900555221671937	2016-03-16T00:34:16	By all rights, Cruz should have been knocked out by losing south, not Rubio. But he has tea party and they won't abandon over electability.
BenjySarlin	709900304620265472	2016-03-16T00:33:16	More than any other candidate, Rubio's voters told me they supported him because of electoral X's and O's. It's not enough to win.
BenjySarlin	709900170419441665	2016-03-16T00:32:44	The biggest thing Rubio was missing was an underlying accomplishment or issue that could keep supporters loyal in hard times.
BenjySarlin	709899947802533888	2016-03-16T00:31:51	It's the only speech that gets practiced (in dread) in one's head a million times. 
BenjySarlin	709899508222730240	2016-03-16T00:30:06	Florida was a testing ground for an all-out anti-Trump offensive. It did not work.  
BenjySarlin	709899166080696320	2016-03-16T00:28:45	This is why I don't think "If only he did this sooner" explains much. He did do it, it didn't get him anywhere.  
BenjySarlin	709898980352724992	2016-03-16T00:28:00	And Chris Christie has been turned  
BenjySarlin	709898490550337536	2016-03-16T00:26:04	Those polls this week showing Rubio leading Clinton are going to be referenced for years if GOP loses in November

BenjySarlin	709895693478010880	2016-03-16T00:14:57	Rubio acknowledging political history started before 2009
BenjySarlin	709894912104374272	2016-03-16T00:11:50	Rubio's performance in FL makes me wonder if there weren't deeper problems with his campaign than on surface. 
BenjySarlin	709894440878514176	2016-03-16T00:09:58	Florida falls. Ohio still stands. Last chance to put GOP on track for an insane contested convention.
BenjySarlin	709894131158540288	2016-03-16T00:08:44	Joelmentum I wonder if they even needed to say it then?
BenjySarlin	709893967534489601	2016-03-16T00:08:05	Rubio is almost certainly out of the race. But his final days were the most compelling of his entire campaign: 
BenjySarlin	709893439094177794	2016-03-16T00:05:59	It's not just that Rubio got blown out in Florida, it's that the polls looked the same for months no matter his national position
BenjySarlin	709892195491385345	2016-03-16T00:01:03	Meanwhile at the RNC 
BenjySarlin	709892026913976321	2016-03-16T00:00:23	Trump wins FL, per NBC.

BenjySarlin	709890508563324929	2016-03-15T23:54:21	Florida clearly doesn't want to have to deal with another recount ever again
BenjySarlin	709890317575700481	2016-03-15T23:53:35	Does anyone know a similar call from one candidate to support a rival without dropping out first?

BenjySarlin	709885956929691648	2016-03-15T23:36:15	One word of caution on exits that are out: no 3rd wave data yet. Both Trump and Sanders have done better in the late waves.  Working people
BenjySarlin	709886913101107201	2016-03-15T23:40:03	In Ohio GOP, 41% say they'll "seriously consider" third party if it's Trump-Clinton and 74% of Kasich voters. NeverTrump by the numbers.
BenjySarlin	709885653702541312	2016-03-15T23:35:03	Per exits, 7% of Ohio GOP votes are from Democrats, Kasich winning them 54-42. Crossover Trump vs strategic voters?

BenjySarlin	709815345691885568	2016-03-15T18:55:40	owillis By that definition it's pretty close to Obama. Can't say it enough: Trump just isn't another normal conservative Republican.

BenjySarlin	706942247716032513	2016-03-07T20:39:00	Pretty much everything except top line number in ppppolls OH survey points to Kasich victory. But it's one poll...
BenjySarlin	706939959584882689	2016-03-07T20:29:55	You'd also expect this to be accompanied by Kasich consolidating that vote in Ohio. 
BenjySarlin	706939522894864384	2016-03-07T20:28:11	So Kasich competitive in OH, Rubio in FL, Cruz just won handful of states.....this race is wild

BenjySarlin	705899520312414208	2016-03-04T23:35:35	I've covered CPAC for years. In retrospect, it was overloaded with signs that Trump was around the corner.  
BenjySarlin	705899117155893248	2016-03-04T23:33:59	Donald Trump isn't at CPAC. Donald Trump is CPAC. My piece on how CPAC predicted his rise over many years: 
BenjySarlin	705887881911468032	2016-03-04T22:49:20	Carson is asked at CPAC Q&amp;A for two words that describe him.   He replies, “The Children."
BenjySarlin	705884036254846978	2016-03-04T22:34:03	Jindal's determination to run for president as a man who refused to raise revenue was a calamity for Louisiana. 
BenjySarlin	705881497639718912	2016-03-04T22:23:58	great line 
BenjySarlin	705878075867840513	2016-03-04T22:10:22	Fun regular feature of CPAC: People cheering speakers in the media section
BenjySarlin	705872449255153665	2016-03-04T21:48:01	mdavidbrown Bagginator allahpundit He's been booed here before and at other conservative conferences, not his crowd. Doesn't say much.
BenjySarlin	705869135054561282	2016-03-04T21:34:50	GrahamDavidA "I was saying Croooooooz"
BenjySarlin	705868833068871681	2016-03-04T21:33:38	Ooh some "Donald Trump" chants responding to Cruz, quickly drowned out by more BOOOOOOs
BenjySarlin	705868690470916097	2016-03-04T21:33:04	Cruz: "So Donald Trump is skipping CPAC" Audience: BOOOOOOOO
BenjySarlin	705842645189455873	2016-03-04T19:49:35	Someone in crowd at CPAC yelling: "TRUMP IS A DICTATOR"
BenjySarlin	705831447186251776	2016-03-04T19:05:05	"You and I, we've never been The Establishment, Sean." 👊- 2-term OH Gov, 10-term US Rep, FNC Host &amp; Lehman Brothers Executive John Kasich
BenjySarlin	705835854145703936	2016-03-04T19:22:36	Zero ambiguity there. Zero ambiguity here:  But one lawyerly statement and presto.  
BenjySarlin	705834489340141568	2016-03-04T19:17:10	colinwilhelm Oh I used the word terror in my writeup. But that's only one sub issue.
BenjySarlin	705833503536058369	2016-03-04T19:13:15	This might be a good formula, but even that I think doesn't capture it. It's really no position at all.  
BenjySarlin	705832696044503042	2016-03-04T19:10:03	The closest I can think of with Trump, is imagine if every single flip flop Mitt Romney was accused of happened in one single day not years
BenjySarlin	705832427969777664	2016-03-04T19:08:59	I know it's easy to cynically go "All politicians are flip floppers and liars," but what we're seeing is not common. At all. No precedent.
BenjySarlin	705831182911590400	2016-03-04T19:04:02	Now, there are real issues with over-coverage of Trump at points. But he also REQUIRES the most coverage just to do basic fact checking.
BenjySarlin	705830508983414784	2016-03-04T19:01:21	5. At some point the only way to go is "Trump, who habitually changes positions and demonstrably lies." There's just no way to referee this.
BenjySarlin	705830386992021505	2016-03-04T19:00:52	4. The point is you get worn down litigating even one issue just to prove Trump said something personally. It's impossible situation.
BenjySarlin	705830270281359361	2016-03-04T19:00:24	3. But that hardly really captures the total lack of position. Now imagine when he's made 4 or 5 more statements going back and forth.
BenjySarlin	705830196146995201	2016-03-04T19:00:07	2. If you say "Trump endorsed war crimes and promised to implement them repeatedly, but walked it back in a statement" you're sorta there
BenjySarlin	705830077389520896	2016-03-04T18:59:38	Want to keep highlighting this problem: You have a 30 second news segment. How do you refer to Trump's war crimes position when it comes up?
BenjySarlin	705829180232044544	2016-03-04T18:56:04	Now Hannity grilling Kaisch on whether he'll play along with Romney's contested convention plan.
BenjySarlin	705827753166290944	2016-03-04T18:50:24	Prediction: The first time some radio host challenges Trump from the right on why he backed down on torture, he'll shift right back.
BenjySarlin	705827525147148289	2016-03-04T18:49:30	Trump has spent months promising to torture and praising a mass execution. Now there's a vague statement walking back. This is normal day.
BenjySarlin	705826952758870016	2016-03-04T18:47:13	Seems to leave a lot of leeway for interpretation, doesn't specifically say torture  
BenjySarlin	705826218118135808	2016-03-04T18:44:18	Even Goldwater got Nixon and Eisenhower to endorse  
BenjySarlin	705824615445172225	2016-03-04T18:37:56	Sad!  
BenjySarlin	705824096525930497	2016-03-04T18:35:52	Kasich time at CPAC
BenjySarlin	705823762898395136	2016-03-04T18:34:33	TheRickWilson Save yourself
BenjySarlin	705823508513816576	2016-03-04T18:33:32	Romney tells BPolitics he’d vote third party or write in someone if it’s Trump vs. Clinton.  
BenjySarlin	705820506876997632	2016-03-04T18:21:37	There's 50 bad stories now. Don't see it being much of a motivator.  
BenjySarlin	705819409726775298	2016-03-04T18:17:15	Is the combo of GOP circus, lots of recent love from Hillary, &amp; a decent economy boosting approval of Obama? Now 51% 
BenjySarlin	705819005437747200	2016-03-04T18:15:39	Anyway, to conclude: The frontrunner has dropped out of CPAC and no one can get in. It's a dumpster fire this year.
BenjySarlin	705818431082401792	2016-03-04T18:13:22	Alright, we already have a parody account for the CPAC security bottleneck: cpacline
BenjySarlin	705817762342563840	2016-03-04T18:10:42	For those worried about the long CPAC lines, don't worry I'm told Secret Service screenings stop when Carson leaves at very end of night
BenjySarlin	705817225228324864	2016-03-04T18:08:34	Secret Service has broken CPAC. Even press can't get in and out of events or get food without long security waits. For attendees, it's nuts.
BenjySarlin	705806957236658176	2016-03-04T17:27:46	CPAC is using full Secret Service screenings and the result is an insane bottleneck -- crowd getting upset trying to get into event
BenjySarlin	705805153480417281	2016-03-04T17:20:36	It doesn't, it says more about his relationship with them. More thoughts on this in later piece.. 
BenjySarlin	705804977307062272	2016-03-04T17:19:54	Trump camp: CPAC cancelled to do big rallies 
BenjySarlin	705804790979231744	2016-03-04T17:19:10	awzurcher Yep!
BenjySarlin	705804371456618501	2016-03-04T17:17:30	Update: There actually is slightly more room for NeverTrump to get on ballot in Texas, but have to act ASAP  
BenjySarlin	705802762014101504	2016-03-04T17:11:06	This is the third or fourth time "Trump drops out of major event I am covering at last minute" has been a story.
BenjySarlin	705802432538931200	2016-03-04T17:09:47	Donald Trump drops out of weak CPAC. Now reporters don't have to wake up at 6 AM on Saturday like a dog. Glad!
BenjySarlin	705801989217771521	2016-03-04T17:08:02	What!!!

BenjySarlin	705789625789452288	2016-03-04T16:18:54	anamariecox No onstage at CPAC, Hannity was interviewing Reince for extended period
BenjySarlin	705789049223700481	2016-03-04T16:16:36	I feel like I just watched one of my stupid "Meanwhile at the RNC" tweets happen in front of my eyes
BenjySarlin	705788663620313088	2016-03-04T16:15:04	Man, reince just got hammered by seanhannity. Throwing down a gauntlet on convention. This is a preview of July for NeverTrump plan.
BenjySarlin	705786507748057089	2016-03-04T16:06:30	Hard to tell whether crowd leans pro-Trump, anti-Trump, or just anti-Romney at CPAC. Tepic mixed responses to Hannity browbeating reince
BenjySarlin	705785650533048322	2016-03-04T16:03:06	Unless something dramatic changes in next 10 days, that probably only happens if Trump wins outright  
BenjySarlin	705785215449473025	2016-03-04T16:01:22	I don't know how Hannity feels about Rubio, but he sure hates the idea of Trump losing at convention. Pushing Reince hard.
BenjySarlin	705785108175970304	2016-03-04T16:00:57	. reince: "Odds of a contested convention are very small." Hannity challenging him over whether it would deny Trump nomination w plurality
BenjySarlin	705783383956262912	2016-03-04T15:54:06	HeerJeet jbarro Good question! 
BenjySarlin	705782906912972800	2016-03-04T15:52:12	jbarro Yep so could Mitt Romney, but that's not exactly an appealing option compared to just being on a ballot with a real party
BenjySarlin	705782793519898624	2016-03-04T15:51:45	Hannity to CPAC: "What did you think of the debate last night?"   Audience: murmurs, boos
BenjySarlin	705782497393643520	2016-03-04T15:50:34	Now up at CPAC: Reince and seanhannity
BenjySarlin	705781936430698496	2016-03-04T15:48:21	The good news for NeverTrump: Ballot issues make it effectively impossible for Trump to go Indy at this point. 
BenjySarlin	705781640304398337	2016-03-04T15:47:10	helitzur No prob, it's a pretty eye popping number
BenjySarlin	705781203618631680	2016-03-04T15:45:26	helitzur Nope. $41 billion fortune.
BenjySarlin	705780274479677440	2016-03-04T15:41:44	NeverTrump leaders have also suggested taking over a third party. But neither of available parties seem to work: 
BenjySarlin	705780109861646336	2016-03-04T15:41:05	NeverTrump leaders have suggested drafting an independent candidate. But ballot rules make near impossible. 
BenjySarlin	705779835499630592	2016-03-04T15:40:00	Everyone talking about a serious third party anti-Trump run: This isn't going to happen. I looked into it.  
BenjySarlin	705773106737106945	2016-03-04T15:13:15	There's a group of adorable little girls handing these out to people at CPAC

BenjySarlin	705769199512248321	2016-03-04T14:57:44	Trump really puts the left's nastier internal debates over gender politics and intersectionality in perspective.
BenjySarlin	705767047972724737	2016-03-04T14:49:11	The savage NotTrumpUntilWereAbsolutelySureHesTheNominee hashtag about to go viral 
BenjySarlin	705765756965879808	2016-03-04T14:44:03	These things are related to one another  
BenjySarlin	705765806701998080	2016-03-04T14:44:15	This really was critical. Just as NeverTrump movement takes off, candidates disavow it.  
BenjySarlin	705764249113485312	2016-03-04T14:38:04	GOP Senators dodge on how Trump nomination affects SCOTUS. This isn't exactly a far out hypothetical question. 
BenjySarlin	705762354680762371	2016-03-04T14:30:32	So weird he didn't gain traction in the democratic race

BenjySarlin	705752641826062336	2016-03-04T13:51:56	I really don't want to imagine what this election would look like if we were losing jobs instead of gaining millions of new ones like we are
BenjySarlin	705633373205606401	2016-03-04T05:58:00	This BenjySarlin lede is🔥🔥🔥  
BenjySarlin	705637727627120640	2016-03-04T06:15:19	Alright, off to sleep before covering CPAC, which hopefully will restore some much needed sanity and restraint to this process.
BenjySarlin	705637159823249408	2016-03-04T06:13:03	. timkmak's take: "The Debate That Killed Your Brain Cells" 
BenjySarlin	705632996947161088	2016-03-04T05:56:31	Trump's penis-boasting is ultimately immaterial; his promise to compel the U.S. military to commit war crimes is what's important here.
BenjySarlin	705632558105497600	2016-03-04T05:54:46	I did my best to keep things to one penis reference.  
BenjySarlin	705632130202603522	2016-03-04T05:53:04	I understand Trump is immune to normal politics. But the substance matters. My writeup:  
BenjySarlin	705631725297111040	2016-03-04T05:51:27	Only the voters can judge Donald Trump's horror show of a debate. My attempt to condense the madness: 
BenjySarlin	705631322924908548	2016-03-04T05:49:52	NumbersMuncher I'm leaving like six off. I don't have word count, but when people complain about press, these are issues w/o easy answers
BenjySarlin	705631117542469632	2016-03-04T05:49:03	This is the problem with covering Trump. There are finite resources to unpacking 7 positions on one issue and getting it to audience.
BenjySarlin	705630959731810307	2016-03-04T05:48:25	You have 800 words to write up this debate. Do you get in:  -Trump U -H1B flip flop -Budget check  And how can you properly explain any one?
BenjySarlin	705629812648378369	2016-03-04T05:43:51	BenjySarlin 
BenjySarlin	705629417620410369	2016-03-04T05:42:17	Trying to find the proper visual analogue for Trump's positions, this is closest I can come up with 
BenjySarlin	705627858153025536	2016-03-04T05:36:05	Verbatim quote from Rubio: "I'll support Donald if he's the Republican nominee." 
BenjySarlin	705627801026560000	2016-03-04T05:35:52	It's worked on about 100 of these disputes so far  
BenjySarlin	705627637520080897	2016-03-04T05:35:13	Again, there is no "true" Trump position on H1B visas. There never was one in the first place. There never will be one. There's the moment.
BenjySarlin	705627190709202945	2016-03-04T05:33:26	Trump was specifically asked about H1Bs in the CNBC debate Kelly referenced. But lol nothing matters.  
BenjySarlin	705625351691472896	2016-03-04T05:26:08	Trump releases confusing statement now clarifying he opposes H1B visas again, because this is what always happens

BenjySarlin	705605788400652288	2016-03-04T04:08:24	Okay, that should fix the race.  
BenjySarlin	705604612212936704	2016-03-04T04:03:43	NeverTrump really matters. They still won't argue he's out of bounds of normal partisan politics. Instead it's "Eh, I'd be better I guess."
BenjySarlin	705603605441617920	2016-03-04T03:59:43	MaybeTrump
BenjySarlin	705603212112322560	2016-03-04T03:58:09	This is where the anti-Trump movement falls apart. Everyone's willing to attack, no ones willing to fully say no.  
BenjySarlin	705602792275079168	2016-03-04T03:56:29	Rubio finally comes out for Trump if he's the nominee. Off the NeverTrump list.

BenjySarlin	705595330654384128	2016-03-04T03:26:50	Look, I'm trying to use the joshtpm model here. Trump is projecting dominance. His voters only see that. So far it hasn't been wrong.

BenjySarlin	705544355675820033	2016-03-04T00:04:17	Also how many more people in the party have the authority to do something similar?   
BenjySarlin	705542614859325442	2016-03-03T23:57:22	Biggest thing Romney did was draw attention to a comprehensive critique of Trump. Few people who can command the attention needed for it.

BenjySarlin	705538205135872000	2016-03-03T23:39:51	Rubio hinted at this message, but Romney made it explicit: Trump is a possible dictator. It's incredible we're having this debate.
BenjySarlin	705537822317518849	2016-03-03T23:38:19	Finally read full Romney speech. It's uneven, but there's been nothing like it before and this passage stands out.

BenjySarlin	705164342489194496	2016-03-02T22:54:15	Broadly speaking, GOP has shown little interest in stopping Trump most of race. But they'd go for some wild last-ditch convention coup?

BenjySarlin	705097185201942529	2016-03-02T18:27:23	This speaks to serious difficulty covering Trump. How do you even refer to an issue or quote when he's on all sides of it and none at all?

BenjySarlin	705073611443466240	2016-03-02T16:53:43	Anyway, Trump is the favorite to win. There really are two weeks to plausibly stop him. Something will have to change for it to happen.

BenjySarlin	705060654059798529	2016-03-02T16:02:13	SeanTrende NoahCRothman Exactly. It's asking MSM to act like a political campaign when top campaigns themselves weren't touching Trump

BenjySarlin	705059838599032837	2016-03-02T15:58:59	SeanTrende NoahCRothman Right, that's a separate and real issue. He has so much going on it's hard for any one thing to break through.

BenjySarlin	705059170278506496	2016-03-02T15:56:20	NoahCRothman Sure, but then you want to sanction media to go: "We reported this months ago but we're going to talk nonstop about it now"
BenjySarlin	705058740664451074	2016-03-02T15:54:37	NoahCRothman To the extent it does, this is the kind of stuff conservatives were most furious over in 2012 and earlier campaigns

BenjySarlin	704077048940269568	2016-02-28T22:53:44	....also we may have to execute prisoners en masse while defiling the bodies

BenjySarlin	704075149767737344	2016-02-28T22:46:11	Fun watching this new GOP glasnost when it comes to pointing out dicy history on race of some prominent Republicans
BenjySarlin	704073935621648384	2016-02-28T22:41:21	pbump Just scared people on subway laughing
BenjySarlin	704073103723384832	2016-02-28T22:38:03	I predict Donald Trump and a whole lot of others are about to develop a severe case of WhaddaboutRobertByrdism
BenjySarlin	704072139067006976	2016-02-28T22:34:13	Richard Nixon for starters  
BenjySarlin	704071954723053568	2016-02-28T22:33:29	What Cruz told a crowd in Alabama on Dec. 19 about Jeff Sessions--&gt; 
BenjySarlin	704067788445519874	2016-02-28T22:16:56	Of all the days for Trump to get Sessions endorsement, KKK day probably not the best one  
BenjySarlin	704026960960360448	2016-02-28T19:34:42	On verge of a Trumpian tweet storm on the parking bottleneck after that Rubio event
BenjySarlin	704022105105559556	2016-02-28T19:15:24	I feel like this campaign is a controlled experiment in everything. Like knowing the exact moment retweeting white supremacists becomes bad.
BenjySarlin	704017155797426177	2016-02-28T18:55:44	I've been wondering whether this is deliberate or not for awhile.  
BenjySarlin	704015268561997827	2016-02-28T18:48:14	Ken Cuccinnelli is here handing out statement to press how Cruz has stood above "Rubio and Trump...making personal attacks at one another"
BenjySarlin	704014307974115328	2016-02-28T18:44:25	Rubio: "Friends do not let friends vote for con artists"
BenjySarlin	704013345347784704	2016-02-28T18:40:36	Great riff from Rubio hailing majority of Americans who work jobs where the goal is not to get rich: Teacher, police officer, etc.
BenjySarlin	704012445933805568	2016-02-28T18:37:01	A good principled time to disavow Trump as a racist would have been when he went birther. Instead, Mitt Romney touted his endorsement.
BenjySarlin	704012180916727808	2016-02-28T18:35:58	It's true, think he's feeding off bigger crowds with more committed supporters  
BenjySarlin	704011498625089536	2016-02-28T18:33:15	Rubio is getting smarter. Trump attack today was entirely coherent, less distractions about his lousy tan or hair.
BenjySarlin	704010903897948160	2016-02-28T18:30:54	Trump will have an other shiny object to overtake KKK in the next three hours. Candidates have to find way to litigate attacks consistently.
BenjySarlin	704010263167692804	2016-02-28T18:28:21	Intense moment here when a protester waving a sign "Marco—Empty Suit" started shouting &amp; was roughed up a bit by Rubio supporters
BenjySarlin	704009934594248704	2016-02-28T18:27:02	Rubio on protestor: "Ladies and gentleman the valedictorian of Trump University." So pivoting from students as victims, to students as rubes
BenjySarlin	704009748803407872	2016-02-28T18:26:18	Protestor waves "Marco Rubio Empty Suit."   Rubio: "My suits made from China, it's not a Trump suit."
BenjySarlin	704008400947044354	2016-02-28T18:20:57	Rubio on Trump threatening press: "He wants to make it easier to sue people who say mean things about him"
BenjySarlin	704008051716722689	2016-02-28T18:19:34	After hitting the guy who's leading the polls while flirting with KKK, Rubio confidently declares "we are the party of diversity"
BenjySarlin	704007621238509569	2016-02-28T18:17:51	Mic back up after a hearty "MARCO" chant
BenjySarlin	704007500186697733	2016-02-28T18:17:22	Aaaand Rubio''s mic is off. Giving his speech into the ether now.
BenjySarlin	704006795333861376	2016-02-28T18:14:34	What's the rationale for staying in?  
BenjySarlin	704006535391944705	2016-02-28T18:13:32	After Rubio went off on Trump's KKK comments, there was a cry of "NEVER TRUMP"
BenjySarlin	704006188703354881	2016-02-28T18:12:09	Rubio: "We cannot be a party that nominates someone who refused to condemn white supremacist and the Ku Klux Klan"
BenjySarlin	704004749293690880	2016-02-28T18:06:26	Crowd at rallies until recently were much less fired up mostly because so many undecided. Now that people are choosing, feeling is different
BenjySarlin	704004533324795905	2016-02-28T18:05:35	This Rubio crowd in Purcellville is by far the largest and most fired up I've seen in person -- tone of election has changed
BenjySarlin	704003134214053888	2016-02-28T18:00:01	George Allen: Rubio health plan "not just some platitude about getting rid of state lines." It's not NOT that exactly either, though.
BenjySarlin	704001872768671744	2016-02-28T17:55:00	George Allen now speaking at Marco Rubio rally
BenjySarlin	703999662794153985	2016-02-28T17:46:13	One thing I'm hearing from Rubio supporters a lot at his rally: Anger that he didn't turn on Trump earlier, fear it's too late now
BenjySarlin	703998385750147072	2016-02-28T17:41:09	This story feels like it was written in the neolithic age 
BenjySarlin	703998125053255680	2016-02-28T17:40:07	DefeatingObama jbarro The bloc that cheers open racism is 100% for Trump, but that's not at all 100% of Trump's camp
BenjySarlin	703997621841612800	2016-02-28T17:38:07	Alternate universe would be all of July painting Trump as unqualified, all of August as not conservative, all of September as unelectable...
BenjySarlin	703997301950435329	2016-02-28T17:36:51	Anti-Trump message is so muddled because of last minute turn: Con artist, not conservative, not qualified, not electable, now racism in mix

BenjySarlin	703988840965529601	2016-02-28T17:03:13	First guy I talk to at Rubio event is lifelong conservative choosing between him and Trump and having hard time doing so. Lines blurry.
BenjySarlin	703978497690243076	2016-02-28T16:22:07	Here's the line for Rubio's 1 PM event in Purcellville, VA 
BenjySarlin	703975162023165952	2016-02-28T16:08:52	You might say he has a love/hate relationship  
BenjySarlin	703974551047290880	2016-02-28T16:06:26	The Mussolini Twitter bot that realDonaldTrump retweeted? That was us. 
BenjySarlin	703972880586039296	2016-02-28T15:59:48	The revisionist history in a few years of the racist elements of Trump's run is going to be epic
BenjySarlin	703955563101724672	2016-02-28T14:50:59	Any Democratic fears about black turnout probably can be put to rest with usable video of Trump refusing to denounce KKK
BenjySarlin	703952766612463616	2016-02-28T14:39:53	Politicians often get support from vile places and denounce them, ending issue. If you actively encourage it instead, it's yours to own.
BenjySarlin	703952013768466432	2016-02-28T14:36:53	It makes sense, he usually doesn't have snap opinions about things, likes to read deep policy briefings first  
BenjySarlin	703950687269478400	2016-02-28T14:31:37	This is THE story. Even if it's 2-man doesn't mean a Trump loss, just necessary condition to get there  
BenjySarlin	703950258066354176	2016-02-28T14:29:54	MarkMurphy2011 Sure 
BenjySarlin	703949746331852800	2016-02-28T14:27:52	Previous Trump RTs include:  -White supremacist meme claiming blacks prey on whites -Neo-nazi user "White Genocide" -SAME user next month
BenjySarlin	703948951972610048	2016-02-28T14:24:43	Trump's Twitter feed has become a clearinghouse of neo-Nazi sentiment and it's happened way too many times to dismiss as random
BenjySarlin	703948555417952256	2016-02-28T14:23:09	Mussolini is full of interesting quotes  
BenjySarlin	703938872946905089	2016-02-28T13:44:40	In which Trump RT's a Mussolini quote satirically attributed to himself  
BenjySarlin	703928707531087872	2016-02-28T13:04:16	Again, this isn’t about Obama for Trump. He praised Tiananmen Square, said USSR was too weak, slammed the US in ‘90. 
BenjySarlin	703933403389886464	2016-02-28T13:22:56	This joshtpm take on Trump as an accumulation of GOP "debt" is worth your time:

BenjySarlin	703744528499535872	2016-02-28T00:52:25	Clinton already looking ahead to Trump. Speech talks up "love and kindness...we do need to make America whole again."
BenjySarlin	703684654323249153	2016-02-27T20:54:30	Many Republicans refuse to believe policy is part of Trump’s appeal. But most Trump voters I talk to say it is. 
BenjySarlin	703664457738788864	2016-02-27T19:34:14	Generally that is not a good thing to do. 
BenjySarlin	703679032366395392	2016-02-27T20:32:09	Jan Brewer for Trump. Establishment dam keeps springing leaks. 
BenjySarlin	703673280419512321	2016-02-27T20:09:18	Rubio hasn't attacked Trump almost at all to this point. It's not like the only option now that he is attacking is one liners.
BenjySarlin	703672355768422401	2016-02-27T20:05:37	Okay, that's a lot more to the point than spray tan jokes

BenjySarlin	703655768550146049	2016-02-27T18:59:43	Among Trump quotes, this has got to rank up toward the top: "I'm so non-litigious it's amazing"

BenjySarlin	703644220347838466	2016-02-27T18:13:49	Trump's insult shtick works because it has veneer of authenticity. Rubio it sounds like consultants brought in Trumph for a focus group.
BenjySarlin	703643646143422464	2016-02-27T18:11:32	This just feels weak to me honestly

BenjySarlin	703643298917969922	2016-02-27T18:10:10	DKThomp BuzzFeedAndrew But I also think they'd be wrong not to. Possible a Trump coalition breaks out normal understanding of environment
BenjySarlin	703643173617340416	2016-02-27T18:09:40	DKThomp BuzzFeedAndrew I think Andrew is right people are considering previously unthinkable scenarios because Trump is already so big one
