herbgreenberg	705386701720408066	2016-03-03T13:37:49	1. HLF stresses the error was non-financial. Yet it was a highlighted metric. Another example why non-GAAP measures need scrutiny. (More)
herbgreenberg	705374820523880449	2016-03-03T12:50:37	2. However, what a whopper of an error. In Nov they cited “active new members” as proof things were getting better.
