schaudenfraud	684906967169552384	2016-01-07T01:18:40	bzc343 Secular / terminal means story ends in zero. Think coal names (oil now?), yellow pages, blockbuster (GME now?) etc.
schaudenfraud	684904583781462016	2016-01-07T01:09:12	LAEQTY No one source for ideas fortunately (otherwise I'd be arbed out). Mostly just reading a lot, follow up when something stands out.
schaudenfraud	684903130211864577	2016-01-07T01:03:25	LAEQTY Longs - anything coming out of BK, spinning off, basically looking for forced sellers. Shorts, look for promoters and follow them.

schaudenfraud	684804402545209344	2016-01-06T18:31:07	No one nearly this bad today, but interesting reading on last time a bank failed in Canada (1985)

schaudenfraud	684516879327608832	2016-01-05T23:28:36	MarkCalabria tangentstyle Very true. Tons of smaller banks went under the old fashioned way last crisis.
schaudenfraud	684288618421075968	2016-01-05T08:21:34	DavidSchawel NN Group (AMS:NN). 10% CAGR over 5 yr gets them to 0.84x current BV. Excess capital = 10-20% market cap. Can buy Delta Lloyd.

schaudenfraud	684268374101114880	2016-01-05T07:01:08	liebo7 Interesting. Think I found it (Pagine Gialle), but any idea what the difference between BIT:PG and BIT:PGR is?
schaudenfraud	684267646842310656	2016-01-05T06:58:14	glennchanWordpr HAH. I always assumed I would eventually be short that stock, but for some reason am not currently.

schaudenfraud	684129770343272449	2016-01-04T21:50:22	FourFilters @Brian_Harper Interesting. Do you have a link for the prospectus?
schaudenfraud	684107058359078913	2016-01-04T20:20:07	FourFilters @Brian_Harper No math but this article has some numbers. 1.6 goal by 2020, 2,000 site adds in 2016. 
schaudenfraud	684057154974650368	2016-01-04T17:01:49	GNW can hedge my biotech shorts too? Agree though, medical innovation long term call option for them.

schaudenfraud	684035648081141761	2016-01-04T15:36:21	@Brian_Harper Agree expensive, though US peers are at 20x TTM EBITDA. I'm passing for now.
schaudenfraud	684035364407783424	2016-01-04T15:35:14	@Brian_Harper Looks intentionally difficult for ADS holders to elect to receive Telesites. 
schaudenfraud	684033506431746049	2016-01-04T15:27:51	@Brian_Harper if ADS holder doesn't get shares, the depositor sells the shares for them after 1/26 and sends ADS holder cash proceeds.
schaudenfraud	683929533985116160	2016-01-04T08:34:42	Still need to model out incremental EBITDA from higher tenancy. Some numbers here  What's incremental cost?
schaudenfraud	683925663833669632	2016-01-04T08:19:19	Will watch for forced selling post 1/26 but those are my quick notes. Let me know what comical errors I'm making here if you don't mind..
schaudenfraud	683925138773913605	2016-01-04T08:17:14	Given pro-forma debt structure, interest expense now &gt; TTM EBITDA. But that's set to grow with Telefonica / AT&amp;T

schaudenfraud	683923160563986432	2016-01-04T08:09:22	Passing on Telesites for now. Have them at 29x EBITDA, $327k USD / site which is high (deservedly so given growth) 
schaudenfraud	683868017000726528	2016-01-04T04:30:15	hkevinbyun Doesn't this mean they have to wait 2 years before something like that doable? 
schaudenfraud	683866807325741056	2016-01-04T04:25:27	@Brian_Harper Seems like another wave of selling should hit after 1/26 depending on how many ADS holders elected not to receive shares
schaudenfraud	683866644192468992	2016-01-04T04:24:48	@Brian_Harper Curious what you find, I'm putting together my notes on the information statement currently.

schaudenfraud	682699134885838848	2015-12-31T23:05:32	10. Analysis is not 100% of being a successful analyst. Unless it’s your shop, you still need to "sell" your idea.
schaudenfraud	682699059145093120	2015-12-31T23:05:14	9. Do NOT outsource comprehension of an investment. If first instinct is to see what investor X thinks after material event, SELL.
schaudenfraud	682698926852550656	2015-12-31T23:04:42	8. Don't be too proud to steal ideas from smart people. Money spends the same from a successful investment no matter the idea source.
schaudenfraud	682698697784832005	2015-12-31T23:03:48	7. Below average businesses deserve low multiples. Make sure the stock still generates good returns with a "cheap" target price/multiple.
schaudenfraud	682698595154456576	2015-12-31T23:03:23	6. Retail turnarounds are near impossible to pull off. I can't tell the terminal from the temporarily sick.
schaudenfraud	682698487067217921	2015-12-31T23:02:57	5. In my experience, investment ideas relying on a sum-of-the-parts valuation have a low batting average.
schaudenfraud	682698403520901121	2015-12-31T23:02:37	4. Beware industries with long cycles. Years of non-generalist experience might stab you in the back right when the most money can be made.
schaudenfraud	682698277201002496	2015-12-31T23:02:07	3. Secular / terminal shorts often work best AFTER the stock is down 50%.
schaudenfraud	682698022589968386	2015-12-31T23:01:07	2. If a stock originated as a SPAC or reverse merger, do twice the due diligence. Even then you should probably pass, or better, short it.
