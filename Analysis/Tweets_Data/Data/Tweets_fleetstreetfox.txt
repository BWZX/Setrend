fleetstreetfox	697172322508218368	2016-02-09T21:36:49	debski2222 it's a way of extending addiction to a lethal insecticide. 
fleetstreetfox	697171501938823169	2016-02-09T21:33:33	Irrelevant. You wouldn't want potassium bromide in you, never mind in a foetus.  
fleetstreetfox	697171207695790080	2016-02-09T21:32:23	It was marketed homeopathic, sold as homeopathic, said homeopathic on packet. NOT harmless. Dangerous.  
fleetstreetfox	697168923062571008	2016-02-09T21:23:18	@Nowthenlass read all the tweets first
fleetstreetfox	697167628297773057	2016-02-09T21:18:09	And no, it wasn't just useless shit. It was useless shit with something DREADFUL added to make it do what it said it would.
fleetstreetfox	697165713090412544	2016-02-09T21:10:33	fleetstreetfox I used to sell the stuff it's bullshit medicine
fleetstreetfox	697166885767536640	2016-02-09T21:15:12	It went straight in the bin. And that's why homeopathy is dangerous, mad and daft.
fleetstreetfox	697166783673999360	2016-02-09T21:14:48	I didn't think for a moment homeopathy would work but hoped at least for a placebo effect. Not brain poisoning.
fleetstreetfox	697166619236306944	2016-02-09T21:14:09	Oh, there was passiflora in it all right, and other useless stuff. But potassium bromide was the active ingredient, a chemical cosh too.
fleetstreetfox	697166410775207937	2016-02-09T21:13:19	And, quite plainly, a chemical compound you wouldn't want anywhere near your unborn child or, as in my case, your mildly epileptic brain.
fleetstreetfox	697166223705010180	2016-02-09T21:12:35	It's a 19thC epilepsy treatment. Sedative. Seems only to still be used in Germany. Similar to what they put in soldiers' tea in WW1.
fleetstreetfox	697166009308946433	2016-02-09T21:11:43	Pack arrives. Unlike online description, ingredients include POTASSIUM BROMIDE. Google this if you never want to rest easy in your bed again
fleetstreetfox	697165793008680960	2016-02-09T21:10:52	Passiflora, it says. Valerian, it says. Look some up, seems harmless. See it's recommended on pregnancy forums. Send off for a pack.
fleetstreetfox	697165624699699202	2016-02-09T21:10:12	7.5 months pregnant, regular insomnia, can't do a damned thing for it. Read in pregnancy book about homeopathic remedies harmless to baby.

fleetstreetfox	697013091758927872	2016-02-09T11:04:05	Today I am writing about Lent and why it's a pile of old bollocks. I'd prepare for a lightning bolt except, well, it's bollocks.
fleetstreetfox	697012909960994816	2016-02-09T11:03:22	RupertMyers no, but it'd be local news. Who her son is magnifies it, just as Ed M's position did in his case.
fleetstreetfox	697010613013188609	2016-02-09T10:54:14	RupertMyers Mrs C is a magistrate; her political views are of legitimate public interest regardless of her son's job.
fleetstreetfox	697007330823696385	2016-02-09T10:41:12	RupertMyers They always are: the row about Miliband was the headline didn't match up with the facts not whether it was fair to report them.
fleetstreetfox	697006896436396033	2016-02-09T10:39:28	RupertMyers Rather different - Mrs C hasn't been accused by an unpopular popular newspaper of hating Britain.
