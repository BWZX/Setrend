Rachel__Nichols	702249913149759488	2016-02-23T21:53:21	So KingJames has played almost an extra season's worth of ball as everyone else has in the same six-year stretch. 
Rachel__Nichols	702245124084989952	2016-02-23T21:34:19	Also this graphic we ran on TheJump showing KingJames's minutes compared to the rest of the NBA is crazy.

Rachel__Nichols	701965570632249346	2016-02-23T03:03:28	The Cavs' story of the night has nothing to do with tonight's game. Kyrie couldn't play against OKC because his hotel room had bed bugs
