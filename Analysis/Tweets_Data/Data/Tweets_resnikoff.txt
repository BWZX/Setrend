resnikoff	692764448705122306	2016-01-28T17:41:30	brianbeutler Good point
resnikoff	692760089648832513	2016-01-28T17:24:10	I agree, but he's at least paying lip service to the idea of trying to mobilize such movements through his campaign 
resnikoff	692758604760399872	2016-01-28T17:18:16	This is a hard question to answer so I'm going to crib from Cloward and Piven  
resnikoff	692756572209045505	2016-01-28T17:10:12	That's not to say journos shouldn't be deeply skeptical when Sanders talks about a "revolution." But they should also understand his meaning
resnikoff	692755396398837760	2016-01-28T17:05:31	That's a weird quirk of U.S. politics and a huge blind spot given the way history so often, y'know, actually happens.
resnikoff	692755188902465537	2016-01-28T17:04:42	Big part of the confusion stems from the fact that campaign journalists are usually not habituated to thinking in terms of social movements.
resnikoff	692754581428781056	2016-01-28T17:02:17	AndrewPaulJoyce Yes, which is incidentally what unions often do with some success in areas where labor density is high
resnikoff	692754117937201156	2016-01-28T17:00:27	I think main difference is this: Clinton is at least somewhat responsive to movement pressure, but Sanders wants to actively cultivate it.
resnikoff	692753052844040192	2016-01-28T16:56:13	That disconnect is incidentally why the argument over whether Clinton or Sanders is more "pragmatic" gets so hopelessly confused.
resnikoff	692752615814356992	2016-01-28T16:54:28	You're not really talking about the same thing when one side cites Frances Fox Piven and the other cites Organizing For America.
