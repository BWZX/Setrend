BenBajarin	726072543308718081	2016-04-29T15:35:58	AaronSuplizio yeah it was. Lots of good content but sessions are kept pretty short on purpose so void of depth.
BenBajarin	726072228853354496	2016-04-29T15:34:43	harvey_wf yes this is dumb. That’s a taxonomy thing IDC developed…

BenBajarin	726067356061949952	2016-04-29T15:15:22	djbressler yep. But it’s a narrative for the long case.
BenBajarin	726062853036212224	2016-04-29T14:57:28	djbressler yep. Even I mis judged how valuable it is. :) we altered pricing accordingly.
BenBajarin	726062298767323137	2016-04-29T14:55:16	Diverse group here at Jazz Fest. And a line is always a good opportunity for research interviews :) 
BenBajarin	726061609366384641	2016-04-29T14:52:31	neiltwitz going from very small to still small quickly will do that :)
BenBajarin	726060888969506818	2016-04-29T14:49:40	djbressler yeah longitudinal understanding drives key insights and shows patterns.  It’s hard and not all of our data is longitudinal.
BenBajarin	726053706957889536	2016-04-29T14:21:07	sameer_singh17 WaltBTIG impossible to model until we see he 7. I’m just saying comps will be better.
BenBajarin	726050888490475522	2016-04-29T14:09:55	Taking the day to hit Jazz Fest while in New Orleans. I’ll Periscope some of the bands in case anyone wants to see some Jazz Fest action.
BenBajarin	726049762948972544	2016-04-29T14:05:27	WaltBTIG main point, is 2017 YoY Q comps will be more favorable than 2016 to 2015.
BenBajarin	726048923228332032	2016-04-29T14:02:07	WaltBTIG I’m just talking total sales following year of S vs. non. S.
BenBajarin	726048630214258688	2016-04-29T14:00:57	rajupp viranchdamani yes fully agree. The answers I get when I pry make that clear and why I sense the relationship is deep.
BenBajarin	726048007192334337	2016-04-29T13:58:28	WaltBTIG this is the first time an S line didn’t perform better than the non S product.
BenBajarin	726047854028967936	2016-04-29T13:57:52	WaltBTIG if I understand what you mean, it tells me they made the wrong assumption as a comparable.
BenBajarin	726047513384361985	2016-04-29T13:56:31	tirunellai IndiaTodayTech yep. Not sure Apple can bank on emerging middle class also. Still think price matters even then.
BenBajarin	726047372703195138	2016-04-29T13:55:57	I completely agree India is where China was 5-7 years ago. However it was obvious given the luxury market in China Apple would do well.
BenBajarin	726047163130617856	2016-04-29T13:55:07	I can’t stress enough how much more price sensitive India is than China (is and was). Hope Apple understands this.  
BenBajarin	726046720312774657	2016-04-29T13:53:22	viranchdamani most of us tend to believe BBK wholly owns or owns most of them and they are just sub brands but its still speculation.
BenBajarin	726046538867167233	2016-04-29T13:52:38	viranchdamani OnePlus’s stuff is made by Oppo’s manufacturing and there is an investment.  I know that much.. But other details fuzzy.
BenBajarin	726046351276933124	2016-04-29T13:51:54	viranchdamani yes we don’t know for fact they are wholly owned.. It could be a JV, investment, etc. but its very unclear how deep.
BenBajarin	726045756251983873	2016-04-29T13:49:32	viranchdamani to be clear, we don’t really know the details of BBK’s relationship with Oppo and Vivo. There is one we just don’t know what.
BenBajarin	725884557006757888	2016-04-29T03:08:59	Interesting how many people in the audience and the players themselves at the NFL draft have this flop product called Apple Watch.
BenBajarin	725823044745191424	2016-04-28T23:04:33	sbono14 well 2017 is the educated guess. But yes, harder to predict than before.
BenBajarin	725802919589605377	2016-04-28T21:44:35	Another interesting smartphone market observation is Samsung and Apple’s big upgrade cycles are on different years.
BenBajarin	725784970162139136	2016-04-28T20:33:15	Perhaps why Twitter also switched to News category.   
BenBajarin	725776778979995648	2016-04-28T20:00:43	Had not thought of how charitable organizations can use VR to take people to where they are doing work. Makes sense and helps raise $.
BenBajarin	725776235767336960	2016-04-28T19:58:33	Fascinating how charitywater is using VR to show people their work bringing clean water to people and increasing awareness and donations.
BenBajarin	725487318228983809	2016-04-28T00:50:30	Twitter just changed to news category in the App Store wow

BenBajarin	725700404676300800	2016-04-28T14:57:13	reneritchie benthompson fortunately, insight is not a commodity :)
BenBajarin	725699739983994881	2016-04-28T14:54:35	Yep. Much fewer. Although, I am bullish on Surface’s future.

BenBajarin	725695659542732800	2016-04-28T14:38:22	m3pols Yes. Larger point IMO is the software/apps are the engagement point not the operating system. MS needs to learn this lesson.
BenBajarin	725691037839138816	2016-04-28T14:20:00	Facebook will teach a key lesson that you can own the customer without owning the underlying operating system.
BenBajarin	725690859950358528	2016-04-28T14:19:18	ow yes.. I have gotten pushback on that statement before so hence my cautiousness.
BenBajarin	725690542256967680	2016-04-28T14:18:02	libovness no, globally.
BenBajarin	725690408211210241	2016-04-28T14:17:30	Facebook could be a once in a century type of a company.
BenBajarin	725690018874941440	2016-04-28T14:15:57	FB still on target to cross the 2b active user mark mid 2017. Facebook is/will be the biggest beneficiary of the global mobile buildout
BenBajarin	725689486227689473	2016-04-28T14:13:50	Gartenberg I also agree the AOL analogy is apt. Also suspect the walled garden gets outgrown. Hence FB needs a family of apps.
BenBajarin	725689280891346944	2016-04-28T14:13:01	FB added over $1bn ad dollars in North America for the second straight quarter.
BenBajarin	725689006395150336	2016-04-28T14:11:56	Gartenberg Yes this had always been my theory. Higher usage driven by higher new users. Older ones use less..

BenBajarin	725688539032244224	2016-04-28T14:10:05	I struggle with the Facebook average user time spent increase, when longitudinal studies suggest long time users decrease time spent.
BenBajarin	725688243606437888	2016-04-28T14:08:54	The most interesting conversation, I think, about FB/Goog/Twitter/Snapchat is whether mobile ads is a winner take most scenario.
BenBajarin	725687987900702720	2016-04-28T14:07:53	Facebook’s 63 million MAU adds in a quarter was the most in a single quarter since 2011.
BenBajarin	725685565128085504	2016-04-28T13:58:15	fmbutt ah. Consumer market is still very young. Lot’s of innovation to come. Apple is only company with firm grasp on consumer experiences.
BenBajarin	725684786984017920	2016-04-28T13:55:10	fmbutt I don’t follow.
BenBajarin	725684302541889538	2016-04-28T13:53:14	chrisdomico Indeed.
BenBajarin	725683892666175489	2016-04-28T13:51:37	Apple’s best days are certainly not behind it. That being said, not sure we see a wave like the smartphone one for some time..
BenBajarin	725682380896350208	2016-04-28T13:45:36	Lots of upside for Facebook. Still, some sentiment on the service from our panel.   38% say they are annoyed at the volume of ads.

BenBajarin	722795938792648704	2016-04-20T14:35:55	chrismarriott yep. Their issues run much deeper than Apple designing them out of modems.

BenBajarin	722786877003026433	2016-04-20T13:59:54	chrismarriott they can do this today see the many apps OEMs include as email, calendar, etc, still get Play Store. It’s changed.

BenBajarin	722785859137703937	2016-04-20T13:55:52	joonian can’t share it but can explain. Bottom line OEMs don’t actually want what EU proposes.

BenBajarin	720260471727599617	2016-04-13T14:40:52	The bot problem is still similar to the voice problem. We still have to use specific language it can understand. Still is not natural.

BenBajarin	717897703372382209	2016-04-07T02:12:05	Seems the high end of the smartphone refresh cycles offset each other in iOS and Android. Android’s big upgrade year is a lull for iOS.
BenBajarin	717897022552997888	2016-04-07T02:09:22	The swing is cyclical. Their older users (there are many) are upgrading. The down swing will hit them again.   
BenBajarin	717868873781907458	2016-04-07T00:17:31	Samsung posted a beat. Good demand for the S7 (finally for them) and strong semi revenues..

BenBajarin	717560640940826624	2016-04-06T03:52:43	But I do think PC ownership likely declines, so the bottom in annual shipments is likely in the 200-250m range.  
BenBajarin	717560397625044993	2016-04-06T03:51:45	Assuming (big assumption) every consumer who has a personal PC keeps buying one, I can argue the PC annual sales bottom is ~250m.

BenBajarin	717534575363133440	2016-04-06T02:09:08	cliffmaier perhaps. It was a beast but yes not low power. My point was less relative to mobile but more for what is happening in cloud.
BenBajarin	717534225914662913	2016-04-06T02:07:45	cliffmaier Sure but what is going on in datacenter and HPC their lack of GPU is a black eye.. They should want all data center dollars.
BenBajarin	717533929935216640	2016-04-06T02:06:34	cliffmaier With a bit more love Tegra could have been really solid in mobile..
BenBajarin	717533737496354816	2016-04-06T02:05:48	cliffmaier deeper dive but I’d argue Intel GPU stuff is still second class… Maybe third..
BenBajarin	717532988171362304	2016-04-06T02:02:50	cliffmaier really? I’d like to her the logic behind that.  Why not just get a license and customize then like Apple does?
BenBajarin	717532181690617857	2016-04-06T01:59:37	Given how important the GPU is playing out to be, who is with me that Intel really should have bought Nvidia years ago?
BenBajarin	717531800034086912	2016-04-06T01:58:06	A series of great points by BenedictEvans.  But that one right there nails it.

BenBajarin	715579005693366274	2016-03-31T16:38:24	bmkatz so in practice you develop then submit with economic model. But what do you do if you have ads in one but not the other?

BenBajarin	715217359355514880	2016-03-30T16:41:21	For example, is it unreasonable to think Oculus doesn’t make it to XBOX eventually?

BenBajarin	714897422116204544	2016-03-29T19:30:02	I’d like one of these.    
BenBajarin	714880407443869697	2016-03-29T18:22:25	Donny_V viranchdamani charlesarthur techpinions insight is not a commodity. That’s what we offer.
BenBajarin	714878843589242881	2016-03-29T18:16:12	9% of my mainstream consumer panel now has and says they are a happy Apple Watch owner. Up from 7% in Jan.
BenBajarin	714848296527724544	2016-03-29T16:14:49	Agree.   
BenBajarin	714791029522694145	2016-03-29T12:27:16	No really, do subscribe. techpinions is worth every penny. 
BenBajarin	714790784042725377	2016-03-29T12:26:17	By me techpinions: Google needs an iOS keyboard because desktop search is dying  1-off read for 50c, or subscribe
BenBajarin	714656192455254016	2016-03-29T03:31:28	PatrickMoorhead yeah for the adult generation. 18 and up.  Age of tablet in use.
BenBajarin	714564346249146368	2016-03-28T21:26:30	BREAKING The Justice Department is expected to withdraw its Calif. legal action against Apple, gov’t official says 
BenBajarin	714564198273916929	2016-03-28T21:25:55	AAPLTree herminghaus less replace frequency and more replaced in past few years etc. Also under appreciated how late some in market got in
BenBajarin	714563195361300480	2016-03-28T21:21:56	AAPLTree herminghaus similarly in four different studies we only see 25-28% of consumers saying they plan to upgrade PC.
BenBajarin	714562879739940864	2016-03-28T21:20:41	AAPLTree herminghaus our panel is mainstream representative not techie. Roughly 28-30% of PC US installed base is 5 years or older.
BenBajarin	714561708392468481	2016-03-28T21:16:01	natisho yes
BenBajarin	714561693322317824	2016-03-28T21:15:58	AAPLTree herminghaus this was just from our consumer study asking how hold their current PC/Mac is.
BenBajarin	714521960458235905	2016-03-28T18:38:05	neiltwitz also what is missed is how much of the mainstream consumer market only got into the category in last three years.
BenBajarin	714521687203516416	2016-03-28T18:37:00	neiltwitz not in US. Active among 16 and older.  Little kids don’t take surveys :)
BenBajarin	714516792513679360	2016-03-28T18:17:33	maxrogo what is quite interesting is how so much of the consumers for tablets only got into the market a few years ago.
BenBajarin	714516600389443584	2016-03-28T18:16:47	maxrogo I’m putting together a bunch of data on research we did across PC, tablet, and smartphone. So just tweeting a few highlights.
BenBajarin	714510922669142016	2016-03-28T17:54:13	The average age of a PC in the US is 3.5 years and the average age of a tablet is 2.25 years.
BenBajarin	714510490664247296	2016-03-28T17:52:30	Interesting data.    
BenBajarin	714501867162632192	2016-03-28T17:18:14	perfy asymco caro_milanesi jandawson longer than 5 maybe closer to 10.
BenBajarin	714494707598950400	2016-03-28T16:49:47	I had not seen this but it’s great. We tested many of these use cases with consumers in our study.    
BenBajarin	714494182459449344	2016-03-28T16:47:42	caro_milanesi jandawson natbro BenedictEvans asymco I know some ex Pixar folks are working on VR stories as well.
BenBajarin	714483921619030016	2016-03-28T16:06:56	The techpinions podcast w/bajarin, jandawson, caro_milanesi and me covers Apple, previews Microsoft Build2016: 
BenBajarin	714489158064930816	2016-03-28T16:27:44	asymco caro_milanesi jandawson as I’m fond of saying… There is no greater predictor of the future than understanding silicon roadmaps.
BenBajarin	714488991513378816	2016-03-28T16:27:04	jandawson abdophoto issue I see is how much compute is needed for VR/AR. Arguably a lot more than a smartphone will ever need.
BenBajarin	714488822008950785	2016-03-28T16:26:24	asymco caro_milanesi jandawson well goes hand in hand since we component roadmaps define what is possible. Also 5yr planning cycles.
BenBajarin	714486125247619072	2016-03-28T16:15:41	asymco caro_milanesi jandawson this will be a long cycle. But writing on the wall is pretty clear where it’s going.
BenBajarin	714483375210278913	2016-03-28T16:04:45	jandawson abdophoto Like I said, think of it as Apple’s TV. TVs are not $100.
BenBajarin	714483264916819968	2016-03-28T16:04:19	jandawson abdophoto custom designs will yield dramatically better experiences.. Too many tradeoffs for mobile CPU/GPU.
BenBajarin	714482924532334592	2016-03-28T16:02:58	asymco jandawson VR will steal time from TV.. The social aspect gets solved by AR and putting your friends there with you graphically.
BenBajarin	714482618813657089	2016-03-28T16:01:45	jandawson abdophoto they will build a self contained headset. No phone needed.
BenBajarin	714482510005075968	2016-03-28T16:01:19	asymco jandawson prob a much longer discussion than Twitter. But the results of our consumer survey were quite telling here.
BenBajarin	714482053371207680	2016-03-28T15:59:30	abdophoto jandawson I think they will custom design the components into the device..
BenBajarin	714481816237805569	2016-03-28T15:58:34	stevekovach asymco jandawson yep, the entertainment potential is huge beyond gaming.
BenBajarin	714481306264940544	2016-03-28T15:56:32	asymco jandawson VR is teleportation. Watch  football game from the 50 yard line, go on safari, experience a hotel in Paris.. Etc.
BenBajarin	714481129345036288	2016-03-28T15:55:50	jandawson asymco both these use cases, entertainment, education ranked very high in our consumer study.. Gaming not so much.
BenBajarin	714478553480310786	2016-03-28T15:45:36	We did something similar but with non gaming experiences. Like diving with sharks, a safari in Africa, etc.    
BenBajarin	714463050405847040	2016-03-28T14:43:59	Microsoft has to demonstrate that it’s building momentum.    Jandawson looks ahead to Build for subscribers. ($)
BenBajarin	714461447992905728	2016-03-28T14:37:37	ramkanda I recommend caro_milanesi and jandawson as well.
BenBajarin	714458299802918913	2016-03-28T14:25:07	ow .01% :)
BenBajarin	714457419951149056	2016-03-28T14:21:37	China’s VR ecosystem is growing independent of the US. Similar to other categories naturally.   
BenBajarin	714317050026430464	2016-03-28T05:03:50	Exactly what I’ve been articulating. New nodes are getting costly and only one customer can afford the premium.    
BenBajarin	713740659211939840	2016-03-26T14:53:28	Going to have to think about this use case.   
BenBajarin	713740494375813120	2016-03-26T14:52:49	jeffersongraham so you are actually on the roller coaster but have a VR headset on?
BenBajarin	713731557609988097	2016-03-26T14:17:18	mobile_reach I’m not sure. May have to re submit it
BenBajarin	713567996975800320	2016-03-26T03:27:22	JrodWilliams agree
BenBajarin	713538694880169984	2016-03-26T01:30:56	KTachyon developing on iOS will have its day ;)
BenBajarin	713537724850909186	2016-03-26T01:27:05	Walked by an Apple Store and all the kids are at the iPad tables while the tables with Macs at them have no visitors. Pretty clear future.
BenBajarin	713532680151785472	2016-03-26T01:07:02	LashaKrikheli this one is for clients but a few highlights may go public.
BenBajarin	713479482552680448	2016-03-25T21:35:39	Ran a study to see what kinds of things the mass market does with their PC and tablets regularly.  Depressingly, the answer is not much.
BenBajarin	713385889804591105	2016-03-25T15:23:44	Unpacked: Digital India   Benbajarin shares 12 key digital stats in India crucial to understand. ($)

BenBajarin	713225834585153536	2016-03-25T04:47:44	ericlin really? No I haven’t but it seems I will now. :)
BenBajarin	713219330368888832	2016-03-25T04:21:53	For all my positivity on Netflix, I certainly have to question the production decision on this one. 
BenBajarin	713212334429196288	2016-03-25T03:54:06	Curse Apple for not having the foresight to get into record player hardware and distribute vinyl discs.  
BenBajarin	713199700707385344	2016-03-25T03:03:53	We are more honest with our phones than with our doctors. And that can help us. Good read.    
BenBajarin	713189142566297600	2016-03-25T02:21:56	Something I’ve been talking quite a bit about. China wants self sufficiency in primary components.    
BenBajarin	713171779926142976	2016-03-25T01:12:57	ericlin what other series do you watch? Not like I have time but always interested in good shows.
BenBajarin	713154870555975680	2016-03-25T00:05:45	ericlin I’m so torn on binge watching. I’m bummed when it’s over and I have to wait forever.
BenBajarin	713153628781957120	2016-03-25T00:00:49	ericlin how do you feel about the releasing of the entire season vs. weekly release? I’m intentionally avoiding binge watching.
BenBajarin	713149393621229568	2016-03-24T23:43:59	kirkburgess I think better.
BenBajarin	713146627440005120	2016-03-24T23:33:00	Daredevil is such a great show on Netflix. It’s a must watch for me now. All you had to say was the Punisher shows up in season 2 as well…
BenBajarin	713142665148108800	2016-03-24T23:17:15	ericlin yes do it. It’s fantastic. Crisp yet subtle.. and not noisy.
BenBajarin	713115194470195200	2016-03-24T21:28:06	daviddirks correct it is not the taptic engine.
BenBajarin	713113378458193920	2016-03-24T21:20:53	Nerdy, but great read. Such a rare skill that exists at only a few companies.   
BenBajarin	713108372275335168	2016-03-24T21:00:59	Got a few messages while holding the iPhone SE. You forgot how obnoxious all prior vibrators were. The taptic engine is so nice on new ones.
BenBajarin	713106985521033216	2016-03-24T20:55:28	jandawson did you try the netflix one? Same thing. Giant TV your on a couch. No body.
BenBajarin	713106854566449153	2016-03-24T20:54:57	This is where external camera’s and sensors can make the physical world digital when needed. Someday.   
BenBajarin	713023509656522753	2016-03-24T15:23:46	All the snickering tweets about Apple’s portfolio getting too complex miss the point – 2016 isn’t like 1997 
BenBajarin	713064393152401409	2016-03-24T18:06:14	sygad1 no no.  Broader point on what AI in general could be like. The best of us rather than the worst.
BenBajarin	713054856810856448	2016-03-24T17:28:20	bradcoin jasontm1 excellent!
BenBajarin	713054205187989505	2016-03-24T17:25:45	In the same way a superstar athlete often struggles to duplicate on a  new team.. Culture/team plays a huge role.   
BenBajarin	713046348518391808	2016-03-24T16:54:31	inafried your “teach it to be better than humanity” is a tremendous point.
BenBajarin	713046235448356864	2016-03-24T16:54:04	This is a very interesting point..     
BenBajarin	713044737704337408	2016-03-24T16:48:07	A major thing consumer tech markets keep teaching us is vertical integration is the only way to defend against commoditization.
BenBajarin	713043948323737600	2016-03-24T16:44:59	Millennials are a disruptive generation.
BenBajarin	713043378875867137	2016-03-24T16:42:43	I have seen a lot of bad Apple Watch analysis over the past year. This may be the worst yet. 
BenBajarin	713043345098956800	2016-03-24T16:42:35	Nearly 50% of respondents have at least one TV connected to the internet.

BenBajarin	713042864167464960	2016-03-24T16:40:41	30% of pay-tv subscribers say they will certainly or likely cut the chord in next 12 months.
BenBajarin	713042336511438848	2016-03-24T16:38:35	ericjackson 6th annual streaming survey.  Just from a few days ago.
BenBajarin	713042072828125184	2016-03-24T16:37:32	ericjackson well I do because I tweet out our survey results in real time when I find something interesting :) Thinking out loud..
BenBajarin	713041731474694144	2016-03-24T16:36:11	Roughly half of Prime members surveyed use Netflix streaming AND Prime Instant Video
BenBajarin	713041650704998401	2016-03-24T16:35:51	Netflix used more by the cord-cutting population than Amazon Instant Video.
BenBajarin	713041577485074432	2016-03-24T16:35:34	ericjackson why do you assume its not me :)   But it’s not, even though I do a lot of primary research. This is Morgan Stanley.
BenBajarin	713041251126288384	2016-03-24T16:34:16	Netflix and Prime members spend more time watching TV in total, but less on TV sets than non subscribers to each service.
BenBajarin	713040817804283904	2016-03-24T16:32:33	50% of Amazon Prime members surveyed stated they used Amazon Instant Video.
BenBajarin	713040083226464256	2016-03-24T16:29:38	Interesting stat..   For Netflix, 45% of users cited original programming as a reason to subscribe (up from 34% in 2014)
BenBajarin	713026618097139713	2016-03-24T15:36:07	neilcybart jandawson the point is how maturity drives the segmentation. Early = less choice is better. Mature = more choice is better.
BenBajarin	713025511425835008	2016-03-24T15:31:43	Why 2016 isn’t 1997 for Apple.     Good read by jandawson and the last paragraph is fundamental to understand.
BenBajarin	713022828107276288	2016-03-24T15:21:04	Now in subscriber inboxes.   
BenBajarin	713013153672499200	2016-03-24T14:42:37	jasontm1 yeah, we have been using cointent today for that. Will use Apple Pay
BenBajarin	713005710301200386	2016-03-24T14:13:02	joaofabio71 wait until entirely new stories can be told through VR
BenBajarin	713003614973747200	2016-03-24T14:04:43	joaofabio71 yeah I said last night on Twitter, those aren’t even in the same ballpark from a consumer reaction standpoint.
BenBajarin	713003444525662208	2016-03-24T14:04:02	joaofabio71 absolutely. But closer to 10 yrs than 5.  Still a lot of hard tech problems to solve.
BenBajarin	713003086852153344	2016-03-24T14:02:37	joaofabio71 think of it as entertainment firstly. All the time committed to watching TV can move to VR and then some.
BenBajarin	713002866080768001	2016-03-24T14:01:44	joaofabio71 why the content is king here. Will be vast amounts of new experiences possible.
BenBajarin	713002459929554944	2016-03-24T14:00:08	joaofabio71 the reactions I’m observing from mainstream consumers who try is extremely encouraging.
BenBajarin	713002341834698753	2016-03-24T13:59:39	joaofabio71 a lot of people are in your camp. But I recommend watching a mainstream person swim with sharks for the first time :).
BenBajarin	713001595206651904	2016-03-24T13:56:41	joaofabio71 things that are more like teleportation than digital / fake were the main use cases they gravitated to.
BenBajarin	713001394274328576	2016-03-24T13:55:53	joaofabio71 watching a sports game, concert, travel, education all tested really well with mainstream consumers.
BenBajarin	712996133333676032	2016-03-24T13:34:59	Exactly why we chose a different business model for Tech.pinions in 2012.   
BenBajarin	712995731791937536	2016-03-24T13:33:23	The good news for VR companies is only 35% of consumers in our mainstream panel had zero interest. Encouraging stat given how young it is.
BenBajarin	712995438819803136	2016-03-24T13:32:14	Good article and I agree. However, VR/AR adoption cycle is likely closer to 10 yes than 5.    
BenBajarin	712995191557230592	2016-03-24T13:31:15	viveksrn AR and VR is closer to 10 year adoption than 5. But AI and voice assistants will be a bigger role in 5 hrs time.
BenBajarin	712994667134996483	2016-03-24T13:29:10	viveksrn I think it will do ok, but by long I’m thinking about India 5 years from now not today.
BenBajarin	712992547589607425	2016-03-24T13:20:44	viveksrn viranchdamani most phones globally are sold at full price. But in similar markets to India we are seeing new patterns.
BenBajarin	712992328969891841	2016-03-24T13:19:52	viveksrn viranchdamani do you believe the Indian market won’t develop? And when it does consumers won’t look beyond $200 smartphones?
BenBajarin	712862408923082752	2016-03-24T04:43:37	viranchdamani chandra1250 yep and vendors can lower prices to move them it just eats into their margins.
BenBajarin	712851412573622273	2016-03-24T03:59:55	Apple is willing to play the long and patient game in India.

BenBajarin	712837037057925120	2016-03-24T03:02:48	bmkatz me too. Greatly.
BenBajarin	712826572848259072	2016-03-24T02:21:13	Should also be in the podcast app of your choice..   
BenBajarin	712812841548427264	2016-03-24T01:26:39	I dive into my current thinking on the matter.   
BenBajarin	712803371376254977	2016-03-24T00:49:01	drewstrojny reading is the main thing I noticed. Dramatically better reading experience.

BenBajarin	712795408586506241	2016-03-24T00:17:23	sameer_singh17 the only question worth digging into is size of market for both.  No question there is a place just how big is the ?.
BenBajarin	712784718341623808	2016-03-23T23:34:54	The not so hidden agenda behind Apple’s new iPhone and iPad.     by Bajarin for Tech.pinions subscribers. ($)
BenBajarin	712780063905677312	2016-03-23T23:16:24	sameer_singh17 I’m still bullish on both. I also apprecIat that both are still miss understood by punditry. :)
BenBajarin	712779749559414784	2016-03-23T23:15:09	We will immediately add this as a form of checkout for Tech.pinions subscriptions.   
BenBajarin	712779461914046464	2016-03-23T23:14:01	I just asked last week on Twitter if anyone thought Apple would start designing its own chips for servers.. 
BenBajarin	712746898474426368	2016-03-23T21:04:37	I hear a lot of analogies to virtual reality and 3D TV. Totally different experience and yielding completely different consumer reactions.
BenBajarin	712742896072466432	2016-03-23T20:48:43	ggruber66 early April we will share the key points.

BenBajarin	712720432546209792	2016-03-23T19:19:27	We have been spending a lot of time thinking about this. Some highlights from our research will be out soon. 
BenBajarin	712705753144909824	2016-03-23T18:21:07	Unfortunately this was entirely foreseeable.    
BenBajarin	712702479234826240	2016-03-23T18:08:07	Nice. The NCAA stuff has been great also.    
BenBajarin	712687673077465088	2016-03-23T17:09:17	Interestingly Apple has a very close partner who is pretty good and cloud… IBM.  
BenBajarin	712686730717999104	2016-03-23T17:05:32	Agree. 1977-83 ish is a unique breed.

BenBajarin	712661690597253120	2016-03-23T15:26:02	APompliano johnnyfio I have done quite a bit of work on this. Much longer chat but all the time I spend with component vendors is helpful
BenBajarin	712659420044337152	2016-03-23T15:17:00	APompliano johnnyfio VR has about a 2-3 year head start on AR from a tech standpoint.
BenBajarin	712659294798282753	2016-03-23T15:16:31	APompliano johnnyfio actually we are no where near where we need to be for the AR vision I have. Much harder technical problems to solve.
BenBajarin	712657810140467200	2016-03-23T15:10:37	APompliano they will go hand in hand when it goes mainstream.  Both use cases same headset sub $400
BenBajarin	712635238321491973	2016-03-23T13:40:55	Sadly 10-15 sec average processing times for the near future.  
BenBajarin	712627194736979968	2016-03-23T13:08:57	This is how Xiaomi should enter the US market. Not with smartphones.   
BenBajarin	712477946041266176	2016-03-23T03:15:54	There is nothing more indicative of the state of home IoT today than unboxing a light bulb and immediately updating its firmware.
BenBajarin	712480799161917444	2016-03-23T03:27:14	Krewell remoorejr oculus won’t be a gaming company for too long. VR is much larger but custom components essential.
BenBajarin	712474998091329536	2016-03-23T03:04:11	reneritchie ah yes indeed. That’s much farther sadly. But Corning is working on it.

BenBajarin	712467508725305344	2016-03-23T02:34:25	wmorein reneritchie for what application?
BenBajarin	712467425418055682	2016-03-23T02:34:05	basche42 jamesmcn yep. Possibly even earlier. We may only be in the second or third with wearables. Exciting problems to solve.
BenBajarin	712466975025274880	2016-03-23T02:32:18	wmorein reneritchie indeed. Lot’s of important technical hurdles to solve but the component guys know this and are planning for it.

BenBajarin	712465569354625028	2016-03-23T02:26:43	As a person who studies adoption cycles in consumer markets, I emphasize it’s early. Apple has all the puzzle pieces 
BenBajarin	712458850893299713	2016-03-23T02:00:01	Finally compiled the results of our VR/AR consumer study. Came out better than I even thought. Makes me even more bullish it goes mainstream
BenBajarin	712284323886538753	2016-03-22T14:26:31	Apple in the Post Mature Consumer Era.   BenBajarin discusses Apple’s strategy in this new dynamic.

BenBajarin	712402513400496128	2016-03-22T22:16:09	Key point by benedictevans  
BenBajarin	712370534822989825	2016-03-22T20:09:05	Entry costs into the Apple computer ecosystem have never been lower.  • iPhone: $399  • iPad: $269  • Mac mini: $499  • MacBook Air: $899
BenBajarin	712370304211783680	2016-03-22T20:08:10	Notes on Apple's refresh - cheaper iPhones and iPads for real work — new blog post 
BenBajarin	712303726686416896	2016-03-22T15:43:37	As I said earlier, these rumors have happened before, but they already deeply customize the GPU with their license. 
BenBajarin	712294487305822208	2016-03-22T15:06:54	0kpkp0 greengart not sure that’s true. As I understand their GPU is custom in the same way their CPU is custom.
BenBajarin	712285011056025601	2016-03-22T14:29:14	Now in subscriber inboxes..  Apple is adjusting to replacement market dynamics.  We explore how and why.  
BenBajarin	712277555865198593	2016-03-22T13:59:37	rodolfor indeed, however, it’s just an IP company similar to ARM. They already customize the GPU to their needs.
BenBajarin	712277314810195968	2016-03-22T13:58:39	greengart sure but they already completely customize the GPU with their license. It’s like saying they need to buy ARM… I get it but still.
BenBajarin	712275063299375104	2016-03-22T13:49:43	Agree. However, given they use their license to heavily customize their GPU I’m not sure what they gain buying.   
BenBajarin	712153350196736000	2016-03-22T05:46:04	WaltFrench asymco the narrative that needs to be told is growth can come from more than just hardware.
BenBajarin	712152716810657793	2016-03-22T05:43:33	And if forensics can do it then so can malicious criminals. Security and encryption will remain a moving target.  
BenBajarin	712151863982841856	2016-03-22T05:40:10	WaltFrench asymco meaning margin is prob pretty high.
BenBajarin	712151787998871552	2016-03-22T05:39:52	WaltFrench asymco possible and of course we love the services narrative. But cost to make this is low due to mature process and scale tech
BenBajarin	712126463760158720	2016-03-22T03:59:14	Enjoyed meeting duak today and talking tech in India.
BenBajarin	712124623215677440	2016-03-22T03:51:55	Yep. If $399 was actually $399 in India then different story there.    
BenBajarin	712122233678909440	2016-03-22T03:42:25	Apple iPhone SE to be available in India from early April

BenBajarin	712068364428914689	2016-03-22T00:08:22	We are saddened by Andy Grove's passing. He made the impossible happen, time and again.  
BenBajarin	712060646020362242	2016-03-21T23:37:42	The "new" data point tim_cook shared today on Watch "a third change bands regularly"  is not news for Wristly :) 
BenBajarin	712043513114927106	2016-03-21T22:29:37	The government just moved to vacate tomorrow's hearing in Apple v FBI. Seems they're abandoning this as a test case! 
BenBajarin	712031673857261569	2016-03-21T21:42:34	With asymco about to discuss Apple on Bloomberg West. 
BenBajarin	712018050573148161	2016-03-21T20:48:26	 Sizes…  1B active iOS devices 13% sold in 2015 were 4” 33% of 1st time iPhone buyers buy 4” 65% of iPads sold were 9.7”
BenBajarin	712015551149658112	2016-03-21T20:38:30	Agree it seems this market is shrinking. But this size pulls in many first time iPhone buyers.    
BenBajarin	711984483633745920	2016-03-21T18:35:03	6/ Everything new, all innovation happening on mobile OS and mobile hardware (+cloud). That's done. We're just in a long tail now. // EOTS
BenBajarin	711982627092189184	2016-03-21T18:27:40	1/ Ppl keep asking for "desktop" s/w on an iPad but keep forgetting that (a) already there (b) the desktop is rear-view mirror view.
BenBajarin	711997489440645120	2016-03-21T19:26:44	PatrickMoorhead yep.
BenBajarin	711994302704930816	2016-03-21T19:14:04	You will have to pry my plus sized iPhone from my cold dead hands but this was the prettiest designed iPhone IMO. 
BenBajarin	711981260394987521	2016-03-21T18:22:15	samdusi not in general no, but it does in this case.
BenBajarin	711979877642055680	2016-03-21T18:16:45	Vast majority of consumers have no plans to buy a new PC or tablet in 2016.  Mass market is a tough crowd. Marketing will be key.
BenBajarin	711979767776423936	2016-03-21T18:16:19	From a recent study of mine, 25% of PC owners still unsure if they will upgrade in 2016 and 28% of tablet owners unsure. So potential..
BenBajarin	711977516865441792	2016-03-21T18:07:22	You have to appreciate how many techies are out of touch with how normal consumers use PCs.. Good thing Apple isn’t.
BenBajarin	711976437268361220	2016-03-21T18:03:05	a_martinoro 600m consumer PCs in use over 5 yrs old..
BenBajarin	711975983423696897	2016-03-21T18:01:16	Between Apple’s iPad lineup and the Windows PC lineup for 2016 it’s the strongest hardware year in consumer PC hardware.Curious if they move
BenBajarin	711975245935026176	2016-03-21T17:58:21	That’s a lot of computer for $599. Portability and capability.   
BenBajarin	711974554353020928	2016-03-21T17:55:36	Apple packed so much into the new 9.7″ iPad Pro. Giving consumers ever reason to upgrade. 30% of global iPad base still on version 1 or 2..
BenBajarin	711972706309136384	2016-03-21T17:48:15	The iPad Pro 9.7 not only appeals to PC owners but to Mac users who are not willing to give up their MacBooks quite yet
BenBajarin	711972657609060352	2016-03-21T17:48:04	The battle for the consumer PC upgrade cycle will be fierce.
BenBajarin	711972483109244931	2016-03-21T17:47:22	Also new for Apple to officially start positioning iPad as PC replacement. Which for many consumers it absolutely can be.
BenBajarin	711972371763036160	2016-03-21T17:46:55	I’ve talked about the 600m PC in use over 5 yrs old number before. Apple targeting iPad at this upgrade number as I predicted.
BenBajarin	711972257753485312	2016-03-21T17:46:28	iPad 9.7″ is the perfect compromise of portability and capability.
BenBajarin	711972167458508800	2016-03-21T17:46:07	9.7 inch iPad sales 200m to date. Very closely follow the mix model I have.
BenBajarin	711971762200662016	2016-03-21T17:44:30	As we get into iPad news here is what the iPad installed base looks like in key markets AppleEvent 
BenBajarin	711970884479651841	2016-03-21T17:41:01	Apple News. 50 million active users
BenBajarin	711970868595798016	2016-03-21T17:40:57	Interesting app suggestions feature in Health. Would like to see more like this in other apps to help us discover more apps.
BenBajarin	711970536415363072	2016-03-21T17:39:38	$400 for a 4" 'smaller' iPhone with pretty-much current specs instead of 2-year-old specs. Interesting. Pull demand up from mid-range
BenBajarin	711970578551349248	2016-03-21T17:39:48	Given many global carriers understanding the value of an iPhone owner to their network, I think some may get aggressive with SE promotions.
BenBajarin	711970141861335040	2016-03-21T17:38:04	Strong iPhone lineup for 2016 across the family line.
BenBajarin	711969804857450496	2016-03-21T17:36:43	And immediately regretting it. 
BenBajarin	711969556433018881	2016-03-21T17:35:44	The 30m 4-inch iPhone sales number for 2015 is only half the story. Other half is how many w 4-inch phones *didn’t* buy a new phone in 2015.
BenBajarin	711969626897272832	2016-03-21T17:36:01	The iPhone SE, a pretty powerful small phone.
BenBajarin	711969103070670848	2016-03-21T17:33:56	We are here to talk about a smaller iPhone: iPhone se. Here is how many people are still on the smaller phones 
BenBajarin	711968725042212864	2016-03-21T17:32:26	Key point being made that for many consumers the 4″ (5 or 5s) was the gateway / first iPhone bringing them into the ecosystem.
BenBajarin	711968159947816961	2016-03-21T17:30:11	Nice updates to Apple TV. Dictation a big one for usernames and passwords.. That was a huge pain before.
BenBajarin	711967376334454784	2016-03-21T17:27:04	Learning from the $249 price of Apple Watch moving in large volumes the lower $299 price makes it attractive at entry level pricing.
BenBajarin	711966601873006593	2016-03-21T17:24:00	And yet “Apple” won’t have/use it – you’ll remain in control, and share as you choose with 3rd parties 
BenBajarin	711966555240669186	2016-03-21T17:23:49	HumbleRando chillmage it’s encrypted so they don’t see it.
BenBajarin	711966019313541120	2016-03-21T17:21:41	And your financial data, and your families financial and health data, etc..    
BenBajarin	711965682812854272	2016-03-21T17:20:21	PatrickMoorhead sure. But the point is value is not estimated 1:1. You can pragmatically associate value to Apple products.
BenBajarin	711965266326884352	2016-03-21T17:18:41	Can’t underestimate the privacy, environment, health, and social good narrative Apple has. Many reasons to not just buy cheap.
BenBajarin	711964050934992898	2016-03-21T17:13:52	Privacy, environment, health.
BenBajarin	711964243185172481	2016-03-21T17:14:37	Buy a cheap smartphone, PC, or tablet, and watch it fill a landfill. Buy and Apple product and support sustainability.Interesting narrative.
BenBajarin	711963865177698304	2016-03-21T17:13:07	This was pretty fantastic. Strong story around sustainability and enviroment from Apple.    
BenBajarin	711959175039815680	2016-03-21T16:54:29	chrisdomico yes
BenBajarin	711958214108012544	2016-03-21T16:50:40	duak would love to say hi after the keynote. Would be good to chat in person.
BenBajarin	711956582544777216	2016-03-21T16:44:11	It was in this small theater, to a half empty room, where I saw Steve Jobs announce the very first iPod in 2001.

BenBajarin	711902845100957701	2016-03-21T13:10:39	flavio82ams yeah, I track the supply chain. Makes sense give the legacy galaxy base.  Likely 35-40m S7 sales in 2016..
BenBajarin	711773094008893440	2016-03-21T04:35:04	benthompson of the Sheboygan variety.

BenBajarin	709853987202183169	2016-03-15T21:29:13	efstrok sbono14 flavio82ams yes I did. Sorry.
BenBajarin	709844006222434304	2016-03-15T20:49:34	sbono14 flavio82ams correct it’s less than 10% who go from android to iOS and most of that is people going back to Android.
BenBajarin	709824338111778816	2016-03-15T19:31:24	iollmann asymco so true.
BenBajarin	709816805301166080	2016-03-15T19:01:28	flavio82ams sales largely refers to replacements…but we know what % of those replacements go where to which platform as switch or not.
BenBajarin	709816486227894273	2016-03-15T19:00:12	flavio82ams point is sales is not what you can use here.  Have to know user base growth rates as we do.
BenBajarin	709816302672617473	2016-03-15T18:59:28	flavio82ams just because IOS sales are down that does not mean they are losing customers. Also % doesn’t show you volume..
BenBajarin	709816041069613056	2016-03-15T18:58:26	flavio82ams sorry your looking at absolute numbers that can be used for installed base metrics.

BenBajarin	709805213981380608	2016-03-15T18:15:25	chuck_late asymco but the biz model implications are critical to understand.
BenBajarin	709804993121902592	2016-03-15T18:14:32	chuck_late asymco simply can’t ignore that Apple controls the vast majority of most valuable customers. That’s the point.

BenBajarin	708323579650138115	2016-03-11T16:07:56	sameer_singh17 not true since newer models skew more early adopter.. Hence I see different cohort usage by techie vs. mainstream.

BenBajarin	708155007237885952	2016-03-11T04:58:05	AAPLTree ha true. Well your number depends on your first few answers.
BenBajarin	708154472220897280	2016-03-11T04:55:57	Less focus on CPU cores and more focus on better GPU designs is the trend to watch. 
BenBajarin	708152282831917058	2016-03-11T04:47:15	For the late night crew, and my friends in Asia, I’m doing a VR/AR study. Would love your opinion. Only a few Qs.  
BenBajarin	708096879146328064	2016-03-11T01:07:06	Apple explicitly tells reporters (first time?) that China servers are Chinese customer data only — and encrypted. 
BenBajarin	708150298276077568	2016-03-11T04:39:22	greengart and to see me there :)
BenBajarin	708112027206594560	2016-03-11T02:07:18	chuasoonhau some yes.
BenBajarin	708070822900924421	2016-03-10T23:23:34	Absolutely feels like the DOJ’s filing is much more about taking down Apple publicly than actually answering legal arguments.
BenBajarin	708043745573232640	2016-03-10T21:35:58	robertmclaws jckgld I’d love it if this vision plays out. Really hard to predict this though.
BenBajarin	708041829065760769	2016-03-10T21:28:21	Jack takes a look at the smartphone as main PC metaphor but is still skeptical.   
BenBajarin	708041281432195073	2016-03-10T21:26:10	yoshicarroll excellent point.
BenBajarin	708037836327366656	2016-03-10T21:12:29	3alvestonplace Ben @ creativestrategies. Com
BenBajarin	708036206085312513	2016-03-10T21:06:00	3alvestonplace sure. May be interesting to collaborate too since we focus on different segments.
BenBajarin	708033960702443520	2016-03-10T20:57:05	3alvestonplace always happy to chat. We do quite a bit of this internal via our own custom panels. All consumer though.
BenBajarin	708031925064052736	2016-03-10T20:49:00	3alvestonplace thanks and yes. Particularly when a market is new and your doing forward looking quant.  But the results are good so far.
BenBajarin	708031220886609920	2016-03-10T20:46:12	3alvestonplace indeed. I tried to develop questions for every answer including that one. If you selected no interest you got diff questions
BenBajarin	708026766477041664	2016-03-10T20:28:30	tomfgoodwin plus as you can imagine all the interested parties want to know my results so I focused on the landscape.
BenBajarin	708026647249682432	2016-03-10T20:28:01	3alvestonplace sorry about that. Study is less on purchase and more on understanding and use cases. There was a no interest option also.
BenBajarin	708026494342209536	2016-03-10T20:27:25	tomfgoodwin asymco focused more on use cases and understanding than intent to buy.
BenBajarin	708024714736705538	2016-03-10T20:20:21	Glad we are delivering on the value with our subscription. 😃   
BenBajarin	708021959800401920	2016-03-10T20:09:24	manicakes neilcybart basche42 yes in my study size of new phones was not the largest barrier to 5s owners to upgrade.  Good enough was.
BenBajarin	708019744096460801	2016-03-10T20:00:36	neilcybart manicakes basche42 a better question to explore is if there is any downside.
BenBajarin	708018296235253760	2016-03-10T19:54:50	neilcybart manicakes basche42 there is yes. Just may not really be that big. But will analyze once we see it.
BenBajarin	708016949175803905	2016-03-10T19:49:29	EliOppenheimer Dpiesh neilcybart yes agree there is a small cohort for the product.
BenBajarin	708016651166351361	2016-03-10T19:48:18	basche42 Dpiesh neilcybart true that 5s in developed markets skew late adopter.  Less engaged user profile.
BenBajarin	708016188203270144	2016-03-10T19:46:28	neilcybart Dpiesh basche42 very small %. Large data sets I have suggest this is a small cohort.
BenBajarin	708016020334596096	2016-03-10T19:45:48	neilcybart Dpiesh basche42 diverse is exactly the right word. Also lots of enterprise deployments in it. So like I said small % for small
BenBajarin	708014855773499392	2016-03-10T19:41:10	Dpiesh neilcybart basche42 the size is not what the 5s base hasn’t upgraded. Most the existing 5s base is largely misunderstood.
BenBajarin	708014466420453376	2016-03-10T19:39:37	neilcybart basche42 this all speaks to my behavioral debt thesis. But the before and after data is clear.
BenBajarin	708014218704867329	2016-03-10T19:38:38	neilcybart basche42 there is a bias in the view. Most when they change like larger more. So yes a place for it just not big one.
BenBajarin	708013434110025728	2016-03-10T19:35:31	neilcybart basche42 prob less than 20% in reality.  Data is showing the 4” too big is a myth. Once they own 6 their mind changes.for most.

BenBajarin	707999946587250688	2016-03-10T18:41:55	mintywalker in general.. whether today or in five years..
BenBajarin	707990800823508992	2016-03-10T18:05:35	It is as wrong to think of 'mobile' as meaning 'a device in your pocket' as it is to think of a 'PC' as a 'personal computer'.
BenBajarin	707995154993381377	2016-03-10T18:22:53	The positioning of this product will be key.   
BenBajarin	707994322310864896	2016-03-10T18:19:34	carlos78oli ah. Well just select no interest.
BenBajarin	707993740837650433	2016-03-10T18:17:16	PetrusLundqvist right now “a simulation of real world experiences done virtually not physically” is the winning definition by mainstream..
BenBajarin	707993527758626816	2016-03-10T18:16:25	PetrusLundqvist I don’t think the interaction part is necessary. Per the definitions I asked in that study..Will see what consumers call it
BenBajarin	707992814445928448	2016-03-10T18:13:35	PetrusLundqvist ok, so what should we consider me taking 360 video of a family event and watching that in VR hardware?
BenBajarin	707992487692898304	2016-03-10T18:12:17	Navesink seems link the link isn’t there?
BenBajarin	707989291222171648	2016-03-10T17:59:35	alexgiess yes especially with dual camera.. The demo’s i’ve seen from components folks is fantastic.
BenBajarin	707988456635404288	2016-03-10T17:56:16	I wonder if live streaming like Periscope has a better chance of going mainstream with VR? Meaning we can capture 3d with our devices..
BenBajarin	707987552423161856	2016-03-10T17:52:40	mims only if they are these.    😀
BenBajarin	707987329571377152	2016-03-10T17:51:47	Graphex1 hmm. It’s a youtube link which should be player independent.  Will look into it.
BenBajarin	707984965464514560	2016-03-10T17:42:24	Navesink sweet thanks! I’ll be curious how much traction it gets there.
BenBajarin	707984575851442176	2016-03-10T17:40:51	Navesink no I want enthusiasts for this one.  I am running one in my mainstream panel separately.  How do I post that? Haven’t done before
BenBajarin	707984171092680704	2016-03-10T17:39:14	life_is_a_sport Thanks! Yes, very tricky to research something most people have not experienced so you can prob see what I’m hoping to get.
BenBajarin	707984001160458241	2016-03-10T17:38:34	Syamant I agree these luxury firms will get it but likely through software stuff vs. hardware.  Too early to know though.
BenBajarin	707982678457356288	2016-03-10T17:33:18	Syamant yeah I snuck that in there :).  Which luxury companies you think?

BenBajarin	707789485853974529	2016-03-10T04:45:38	stroughtonsmith yeah. Sort of concerning it’s exhausting in general. I did the morpheus demo for 35 min and had to sit down :)

BenBajarin	707758338470076416	2016-03-10T02:41:52	PatrickMoorhead agree, but I’d wager SD beats Exynos on graphics in all of them anyway.
BenBajarin	707757485487067136	2016-03-10T02:38:28	Qualcomm has better chip designers so this is not surprising.

BenBajarin	707639247050649600	2016-03-09T18:48:38	WaltFrench see the point I made about how much of the base has a security log in set up. Sort of too late not unless Apple creates BD

BenBajarin	707581884629299200	2016-03-09T15:00:42	joshelman robinchan syang millennials tend to decide quick and don’t “shop” online. They know what they want and where to get it.
BenBajarin	707581300283027456	2016-03-09T14:58:22	joshelman robinchan syang I am seeing vey distinct online shopping behavior of young people in US that are very diff from China though.
BenBajarin	707581102223790080	2016-03-09T14:57:35	joshelman robinchan syang but I think the power echo has shown on voice commerce backs up the concept.
BenBajarin	707580985932513280	2016-03-09T14:57:07	joshelman robinchan syang well in China there were not entrenched behaviors to overcome. Hence my behavioral debt thesis.
BenBajarin	707580792210219008	2016-03-09T14:56:21	robinchan syang joshelman if it is truly more convenient then it seems behavior can change.
BenBajarin	707580528434655233	2016-03-09T14:55:18	robinchan syang joshelman agree since I’m bullish on the idea. But even millennials had little interest in commerce via messenger and iM.
BenBajarin	707578178294779904	2016-03-09T14:45:58	robinchan syang joshelman but the opportunity seems more for those without entrenched behaviors to develop new ones.
BenBajarin	707577969967898624	2016-03-09T14:45:08	robinchan syang joshelman interestingly current messaging apps ranked very low in my study as willingness to engage in commerce through.
BenBajarin	707484220185190401	2016-03-09T08:32:37	Not a surprise as we were leading into Chinese New Year and consumers were waiting for promotions to kick off

BenBajarin	707439888472346626	2016-03-09T05:36:27	basche42 Yep. Hence why this is a core area on my continued research agenda. Still only a thesis but holds implications.
BenBajarin	707438485242834944	2016-03-09T05:30:53	basche42 the refinement in needs, wants, and desires of a market is a result of maturity. An age I think we are entering in consumer..
BenBajarin	707438295484112896	2016-03-09T05:30:07	basche42 yes this is the heart of it. I lean toward depth winning in the future while breadth is solved online.
BenBajarin	707436088546217984	2016-03-09T05:21:21	basche42 hmm. Well the job before was choice (IMO) so with internet catalog that shifts to something else.  Less choice more better choice
BenBajarin	707435616989007872	2016-03-09T05:19:29	basche42 jobs as in human or jobs to be done?
BenBajarin	707435331428216832	2016-03-09T05:18:21	Basically, the death of the department store..   
BenBajarin	707435219905875969	2016-03-09T05:17:54	With regards to the offline vs. online study.. The more data points I get, the more it seems retail has to go specially vs. massive choice.
BenBajarin	707434853466312706	2016-03-09T05:16:27	APompliano but all in all, it feels like retail has to go specialty vs. breadth of catalog.. Early data suggests this is true as well.
BenBajarin	707434735656640512	2016-03-09T05:15:59	APompliano I similarly found, most when they entered a store had an idea but not made up their mind on what to buy yet.
BenBajarin	707434612272832513	2016-03-09T05:15:29	APompliano possible. Could also just be that buying online means you know exactly what you want so now just find best price..
BenBajarin	707432287416274946	2016-03-09T05:06:15	NRellas possible mix of both. But if the depth is the factor then this has future retail implications. Which is my thesis.
BenBajarin	707429969564143616	2016-03-09T04:57:02	NRellas I think so yes. But equally interesting that price was not as large of a driver when they did buy in store..
BenBajarin	707427345771069440	2016-03-09T04:46:37	lhzhong good Q. I found more mainstream consumers engaged in an impulse online buy than a earlier adopter… So key difference in profile.
BenBajarin	707426960029298688	2016-03-09T04:45:05	Fullantho some but not all. It simply seems consistent that the online shopper is much more price centered than the offline shopper.
BenBajarin	707426144111341569	2016-03-09T04:41:50	Overall I found fascinating differences between the online vs. in store shopping mentality. Very different dynamics between the two.
BenBajarin	707425496917651456	2016-03-09T04:39:16	In an online vs. offline buying study I did it was interesting to find price was more a purchase driver online than offline.

BenBajarin	705772885177044992	2016-03-04T15:12:23	Now in subscriber inboxes.  I did my own consumer poll for todays weekly stat.   
BenBajarin	705772212502966272	2016-03-04T15:09:42	jjhikes anyway my original point was larger than Apple even though you interpreted only about Apple.  Custom silicon will yield better exp.
BenBajarin	705772078176206849	2016-03-04T15:09:10	asu_PH :) I know I’m right.  I have the data to prove it.
BenBajarin	705771576810078208	2016-03-04T15:07:11	jjhikes which there will be many of..
BenBajarin	705771011094896640	2016-03-04T15:04:56	jjhikes did you read my end of standard platforms article? Apple wins but for their ecosystem. Broadly no winner take all scenario.
BenBajarin	705770604998184960	2016-03-04T15:03:19	jjhikes my recommendation to all our semi clients is to design specifically for AR/VR. That’s my broad point.
BenBajarin	705770066806050816	2016-03-04T15:01:11	jjhikes more of a belief in the quality of their silicon teams. Also it’s a general point. All who can custom design are well positioned…
BenBajarin	705769744524120065	2016-03-04T14:59:54	It’s more.   
BenBajarin	705769419763486721	2016-03-04T14:58:36	Custom VR/AR chipsets for the win.  
BenBajarin	705762859876093952	2016-03-04T14:32:32	As my analysis of the event has articulated.. This is a teachable moment for the China manufacturing industry.   
BenBajarin	705480964139429888	2016-03-03T19:52:23	adampitchie yeah he is talking more about the many discreet solutions out there.
BenBajarin	705480696672833536	2016-03-03T19:51:19	nnnnicholas BenedictEvans well I’m still waiting for them to announce their own custom GPU..
BenBajarin	705479691914719232	2016-03-03T19:47:20	nnnnicholas BenedictEvans well it all depends on the process tech.. Once we get to 10nm power draw gets much better performance wise.
BenBajarin	705478873228582912	2016-03-03T19:44:05	nnnnicholas BenedictEvans Apple will very likely design their own custom chipsets to integrate into their solution..

BenBajarin	705454959634952192	2016-03-03T18:09:03	ChrisLiter that’s for sure.. I was talking about developing custom silicon for VR/AR headsets.
BenBajarin	705436859279618049	2016-03-03T16:57:08	Pair this with my behavioral debt concept as well. Changing customer behavior is hard.  
BenBajarin	705423142970327040	2016-03-03T16:02:38	And more broadly, companies using Twitter for customer service see a +19% lift in customer satisfaction.
BenBajarin	705435221114667010	2016-03-03T16:50:37	Agree. And Apple would likely use contract manufacturing anyway.  They don’t own their own chipset fabs..

BenBajarin	704042539448291328	2016-02-28T20:36:36	magicsilicon yep. Hence why FB has to have a family of apps to stay relevant. Instagram for teens.. Standard playbook.

BenBajarin	703997612727234560	2016-02-28T17:38:05	sunnysunwords yes that bit is awkward. I’ll be interested in what a 9.7 pro is like.
BenBajarin	703997051835514880	2016-02-28T17:35:51	sunnysunwords no. It is surprisingly light for the size.
BenBajarin	703981563290087424	2016-02-28T16:34:18	SohrabOsati I think this is part of it as well.
BenBajarin	703980587023863808	2016-02-28T16:30:25	scottjenson probably that they are optimized for it. Where web is actually optomized for larger screens..
BenBajarin	703980286518759424	2016-02-28T16:29:14	SohrabOsati or perhaps because most apps are built for small not large screen experiences, where web experiences support larger screens.
BenBajarin	703979579849900032	2016-02-28T16:26:25	SrikarDR yes but also less apps on Mac so web is mostly via browser.
BenBajarin	703979427378532352	2016-02-28T16:25:49	SohrabOsati exactly. I think this is interesting behavior.
BenBajarin	703979234058833921	2016-02-28T16:25:03	basche42 right. What I’m getting at is how screen size lends itself to web or apps depending.
BenBajarin	703978644037718016	2016-02-28T16:22:42	On iPad Pro I tend to use web browser for more things that I would typically use apps for on iPhone.. Anyone else have this same experience?

BenBajarin	702993598501904385	2016-02-25T23:08:29	Well live streaming was fun while it lasted.. % of people who used said app in the last month.. 
BenBajarin	702990583808196609	2016-02-25T22:56:30	flavio82ams darrinlim northead highly doubtful.. They will steal from Samsung and maybe Huawei..
BenBajarin	702979708636393472	2016-02-25T22:13:17	My techpinions piece today is about how the MWC smartphone announcements symbolize broader market changes 
BenBajarin	702985465272492032	2016-02-25T22:36:10	flavio82ams darrinlim northead  I have all the same raw data they do.
BenBajarin	702985359974469632	2016-02-25T22:35:45	flavio82ams darrinlim northead  as % of switchers… Not % of total sales.
BenBajarin	702985244564021248	2016-02-25T22:35:17	flavio82ams darrinlim northead  so to be clear their data and mine shown iOS churn low. Happens yes but more go to iOS from Android as %.
BenBajarin	702984940212789248	2016-02-25T22:34:05	flavio82ams darrinlim northead  and then iOS share as a % of installed base is moot due to the economic part of the discussion.
BenBajarin	702984767843672064	2016-02-25T22:33:24	flavio82ams darrinlim northead  when you see their actual data less than 10% go from iOS to Android and that is mostly people going back.

BenBajarin	702971381940531200	2016-02-25T21:40:12	darrinlim flavio82ams northead agree with that but how does this user help with AI?

BenBajarin	702971054247931904	2016-02-25T21:38:54	darrinlim flavio82ams northead again the main issue is these customers are not worth much… Not a great ad target..
BenBajarin	702970590915743744	2016-02-25T21:37:04	darrinlim flavio82ams northead if we ever see Apple not renew the Google contract for iOS you will see how big a chunk comes from iOS…
BenBajarin	702970360229027840	2016-02-25T21:36:09	darrinlim flavio82ams northead we are talking about customers who make VERY little money…. So how valuable to an ad business?
BenBajarin	702970252049543168	2016-02-25T21:35:43	darrinlim flavio82ams northead maybe very little.  Rural users are such different beasts, and who wants to advertise to them?
BenBajarin	702967499621445632	2016-02-25T21:24:47	darrinlim flavio82ams northead point is folks in the low end don’t do those things.. The call, text and US FB and WhatsApp…

BenBajarin	702965794154500096	2016-02-25T21:18:00	darrinlim flavio82ams northead we have no evidence or data to support the claim the low-end gets more valuable. FB concurs..

BenBajarin	702946179399561216	2016-02-25T20:00:03	flavio82ams darrinlim northead   Actually they are only adding lower ARPU users so it’s growing very very slowly.

BenBajarin	702899011720605697	2016-02-25T16:52:38	sameer_singh17 I’m aware what IDC was :) US alone was close to that between third party and Apple.

BenBajarin	702581756977741824	2016-02-24T19:51:58	darrinlim northead true although Google then doing Facebook a favor since FB benefits the most from that dynamic..
BenBajarin	702580951306489856	2016-02-24T19:48:46	darrinlim northead low end demo has very low ARPU so even data tracking not terribly useful. Very different behavior set.
BenBajarin	702580728366632960	2016-02-24T19:47:53	darrinlim northead most those folks not on a desktop. Mobile only. Spend more time on FB than anything Google..
BenBajarin	702551736745988096	2016-02-24T17:52:41	northead sorry, meant Google. And because of their business model.
BenBajarin	702547127310749696	2016-02-24T17:34:22	kshashi Sure thanks. I believe their data is tracking many hundred thousand websites.. So I guess it depends on the site.
BenBajarin	702544697965699072	2016-02-24T17:24:43	ryanreith neilcybart We are also talking about the market as it is today. Harder to predict future but dynamics right now clear.
BenBajarin	702544484689522689	2016-02-24T17:23:52	neilcybart viranchdamani I also have hard data on grey market there. The dynamics are clear now. We will see if they change.
BenBajarin	702544343022710784	2016-02-24T17:23:18	ryanreith neilcybart yes. This is the dynamic I’m talking about. Philosophically I’m not sure Apple has worked this out yet.
BenBajarin	702543020751605760	2016-02-24T17:18:03	neilcybart come at this from the perspective of an India consumer.
BenBajarin	702541395173576705	2016-02-24T17:11:35	neilcybart that’s my main point. Does a 3 yr old iPhone compete with new ones given hardware roadmaps for Android/SoC companies.
BenBajarin	702541230022877184	2016-02-24T17:10:56	neilcybart you will have to land on if you believe a 3 yr old iPhone can compete with a new one looking at current roadmaps in that market.
BenBajarin	702540329904254976	2016-02-24T17:07:21	neilcybart We simply can’t ignore India is VERY different from China.
BenBajarin	702540231656939520	2016-02-24T17:06:58	neilcybart The struggle I have is how older/remanufactured will stand up to current gen looking at roadmaps in a value market..
BenBajarin	702539928287088642	2016-02-24T17:05:46	neilcybart not cheap.
BenBajarin	702538315854024705	2016-02-24T16:59:21	Make sure to read this and give me thoughts if I’m crazy..   Also could add Facebook/WeChat to platforms..   
BenBajarin	702537896624934912	2016-02-24T16:57:41	wilkos neilcybart also, then, a 2-3 yr old device will be competing with a high spec new one.. So interesting dynamics.
BenBajarin	702537757285961729	2016-02-24T16:57:08	wilkos neilcybart certainly one way, but at the same time there is a pride to something new vs something old..
BenBajarin	702537510606344192	2016-02-24T16:56:09	viranchdamani haha.. I mean I am with you on Facebook point..  Sorry was distracted while tweeting.

BenBajarin	702537289994375168	2016-02-24T16:55:17	flavio82ams Theirs is closer, but I still prefer on device because it tells true usage. Note NMS much closer and shows regional reality.
BenBajarin	702537147299921920	2016-02-24T16:54:43	viranchdamani are with you on Facebook.
BenBajarin	702536909935898624	2016-02-24T16:53:46	Dpiesh neilcybart I would agree with that yes. I’d argue pragmatically the iPhone has tremendous value but the story needs to be embraced.
BenBajarin	702535773648773120	2016-02-24T16:49:15	flavio82ams no just simple methodology laws. Of course if you tally all android hits per day it is higher. Have to look at individual hits.

BenBajarin	702535259141726209	2016-02-24T16:47:12	viranchdamani not my data. It’s a internet data analytics company. So measuring hits to the web by device.
BenBajarin	702535140921077760	2016-02-24T16:46:44	flavio82ams the way stat counter measures is flawed. It doesn’t ping a unique per day. Have to look on on device data as I do.
BenBajarin	702534935274397696	2016-02-24T16:45:55	neilcybart India has a very value for the money centric mentality. So Apple doesn’t need to go low-end, they need to hit value..
BenBajarin	702534803988443136	2016-02-24T16:45:24	neilcybart when you understand India its not. China we knew that wasn’t the case but Indian consumers are not as status driven as China.
BenBajarin	702533422695129088	2016-02-24T16:39:55	neilcybart high desire to get an iPhone, just simply can’t afford it. Brand/trust is very important in India. Apple has it but too $$$

BenBajarin	702532859819487238	2016-02-24T16:37:40	nortools yes. But churn is high obviously as they go to other brands.
BenBajarin	702532738612527104	2016-02-24T16:37:11	I have a very grand thesis about Apple’s strategy for India to share at some point.
BenBajarin	702532595087593472	2016-02-24T16:36:37	shyamuw agree.. But again it speaks to the type of customer.

BenBajarin	702532365843722242	2016-02-24T16:35:43	shyamuw that company tracking that is tracking hits to websites, so mainly through browser, but also in app browser..
BenBajarin	702532111920533505	2016-02-24T16:34:42	nortools That is correct. Feature phone users, as of last few years at least, tend to go to the brand of their feature phone.. So LG, Sam..
BenBajarin	702530460434366465	2016-02-24T16:28:08	shyamuw device analytics. On board analytics.  It makes sense in the economics of iPhone users can afford to be on the Internet more.
BenBajarin	702530197736652800	2016-02-24T16:27:06	rvermamd7 Yes. I think the Indian market is big enough and important enough for them to make phone for India only.

BenBajarin	702525860377600000	2016-02-24T16:09:52	The big issue for Android still is, many who recently upgraded from feature phones basically still use their smartphones as feature phones..

BenBajarin	702525221090099200	2016-02-24T16:07:19	When you dig into platform engagement and usage, while Android has the dominant share I can argue it is not the dominant computing platform.

BenBajarin	701794978578628608	2016-02-22T15:45:36	0kpkp0 Remember Samsung doesn’t ship that many in the high end.. So LG has room to grow. Not large numbers..
BenBajarin	701794189449625600	2016-02-22T15:42:28	0kpkp0 In that case they do since those techy folks are the primary customers for both Samsung and LG Android devices.

BenBajarin	701211467320655872	2016-02-21T01:06:56	Mckendy19 Yep and that is what I have. iPhone share vs. Android smartphone share..
BenBajarin	701211208477585408	2016-02-21T01:05:54	Mckendy19 wisdom comes in knowing who to trust..
BenBajarin	701211106065317889	2016-02-21T01:05:30	Mckendy19 and there are absolutely people who will put out misleading data to get attention..
BenBajarin	701211035689029632	2016-02-21T01:05:13	Mckendy19 it is not designed to be reverse engineered is my point. The details are much more valuable and you don’t get those.
BenBajarin	701210892004827136	2016-02-21T01:04:39	Mckendy19 they just don’t do that plain and simple.
BenBajarin	701210832663764992	2016-02-21T01:04:25	Mckendy19 just remember the data you see from IDC or Gartner is designed to be vague for a reason. Big money on the private details.
BenBajarin	701210722903035904	2016-02-21T01:03:58	Mckendy19 what we give in private is very expensive. People pay a lot for what is not given in public.
BenBajarin	701210435798716417	2016-02-21T01:02:50	Mckendy19 1 billion active devices by quarterly activations.. I don’t believe its that high monthly usage..
BenBajarin	701210273156214784	2016-02-21T01:02:11	Mckendy19 no that’s not true. You only have access to public data. Lots of private side have similar data to me.
BenBajarin	701210103261728768	2016-02-21T01:01:31	Mckendy19 they don’t. They will never give a hard number on that.
BenBajarin	701209967718584320	2016-02-21T01:00:58	Mckendy19 This is something I track very closely. I have the OS smartphone share of installed base in 32 countries.
BenBajarin	701209773702656000	2016-02-21T01:00:12	Mckendy19 yep but never share by market.
BenBajarin	701209457049534464	2016-02-21T00:58:57	Mckendy19 no he wouldn’t.  They don’t give out share data by region.
BenBajarin	701208707166699520	2016-02-21T00:55:58	Mckendy19 right I’m just talking iPhone.. iOS share would be much higher than Android if we include iPad and Android tablets.
BenBajarin	701208511867269124	2016-02-21T00:55:11	Mckendy19 I know firms data will differ on this and you are welcome to believe whoever’s numbers you choose but I trust my research.
BenBajarin	701208288117952513	2016-02-21T00:54:18	Mckendy19 That is incorrect when it comes to installed base.
BenBajarin	701205411668492288	2016-02-21T00:42:52	Mckendy19 in all our previous studies Android had a share lead. The past year iOS been slowly gaining. Now leader or very close.
BenBajarin	701204771076636672	2016-02-21T00:40:19	Mckendy19 I do market research.
BenBajarin	701204212818927616	2016-02-21T00:38:06	Mckendy19 iOS has either surpassed or is neck and neck with Android. First time it’s ever been this close.
BenBajarin	701200505037418496	2016-02-21T00:23:22	Mckendy19 no that’s share of quarterly sales not install base
BenBajarin	701199997706960896	2016-02-21T00:21:21	Mckendy19 don’t look at quarter sales have to look at installed base.
BenBajarin	701198571270373376	2016-02-21T00:15:41	Mckendy19 nope.
BenBajarin	701197107609280512	2016-02-21T00:09:52	Mckendy19 that being said I’m bullish on Alcatel overall.
BenBajarin	701197019587567616	2016-02-21T00:09:31	Mckendy19 those Alcatel stats are also very Europe centric. Very different story in US. Huawei also strong in Europe.
BenBajarin	701196788817068032	2016-02-21T00:08:36	Mckendy19 churn from iOS is consistently less than 10% and almost always people going back to Android.Choosing lower price makes sense then
BenBajarin	701195168603512833	2016-02-21T00:02:10	Mckendy19 really for Samsung.  10% from iOS is normal churn. But in both cases we are talking very small numbers.

BenBajarin	701103958853431296	2016-02-20T17:59:44	rosenbergus pretty sure they have been clear they don’t plan on playing the price game.

BenBajarin	700351243936333824	2016-02-18T16:08:43	Apple’s Principled Stand  Jandawson’s take.   
BenBajarin	700350439322030081	2016-02-18T16:05:31	cliffmaier hey, you have any reaction to this? Does this make it easier for others to make their own modems?   
BenBajarin	699701086656077825	2016-02-16T21:05:13	When you're house sitting for millennials and ask how the lights work 
BenBajarin	700349261850882049	2016-02-18T16:00:50	jandrewyang BUT, even if they are designing based on licensed instruction set, it is crap competitively.  Hence they go back to Qualcomm.
BenBajarin	700349025531400192	2016-02-18T15:59:54	jandrewyang folks I know much closer to the technical aspects keep telling me they don’t “design” anything really…
BenBajarin	700348913589424128	2016-02-18T15:59:27	jandrewyang hmm. It sounds like its a custom design using licensed ISO but so close to ARM design has me wonder..
BenBajarin	700347331896446976	2016-02-18T15:53:10	flavio82ams generally agree yes. However, that Imagination issue is because of ARM and the Mali efforts not Apple.
BenBajarin	700347015776043008	2016-02-18T15:51:55	0kpkp0 I don’t see how that is relevant. It has never been an issue.
BenBajarin	700346428741124096	2016-02-18T15:49:35	0kpkp0 yes but again volume issue… Fabs make it up on scale Sammy doesn’t have high end scale on their own..
BenBajarin	700346129855049728	2016-02-18T15:48:23	0kpkp0 Apple chasing of TSMC is solely to try and keep a competitor competitive. Apple is basically funding TSMCs next node.
BenBajarin	700345992810344449	2016-02-18T15:47:51	0kpkp0 not really since they don’t move enough chips on their own on it. Hence Samsung prioritizes Apple, hence the Austin fab..
BenBajarin	700345801642373122	2016-02-18T15:47:05	If you understand the supply chain, this statement is more accurate to say “the supply chain is captive to Apple.”   
BenBajarin	700345596238962688	2016-02-18T15:46:16	0kpkp0 why Apple manufactures on it.
BenBajarin	700345475099004928	2016-02-18T15:45:47	dougpasnak yes and actually the statement would be more accurate to say the supply chain is captive to Apple :)
BenBajarin	700345155174334464	2016-02-18T15:44:31	parth2eets Samsung is yet to design using a licensed instruction set like Qualcomm and Apple do.
BenBajarin	700345046546034688	2016-02-18T15:44:05	parth2eets those are still ARM architectures not a proprietary one like Apple makes by licensing the instruction set.
BenBajarin	700344932201013249	2016-02-18T15:43:38	BradStone your point on Samsung compare to Apple is incorrect. Also A9 is on 16nm and 14nm so past 20 has happened.
BenBajarin	700344569582387200	2016-02-18T15:42:11	WhatTheBit They did acquire and arch license yes.. But I don’t hear good things.. Also all the best designers don’t work at Samsung ;)
BenBajarin	700344454348058626	2016-02-18T15:41:44	dujkan Yes, A9 is actually 14nm and 16nm..
BenBajarin	700344041980833792	2016-02-18T15:40:06	@DamnPhd morning.
BenBajarin	700343933579046912	2016-02-18T15:39:40	The comparison with Samsung is even weaker since Samsung doesn’t design their own architecture..  
BenBajarin	700343752510935040	2016-02-18T15:38:57	I have several issues with this paragraph from the Bloomberg Srouji profile.   The supply chain point is weak. 
BenBajarin	700342506127405056	2016-02-18T15:33:59	Now in subscriber inboxes.   
BenBajarin	700334882069749760	2016-02-18T15:03:42	jandrewyang agree. Also objectively incorrect statement by Mike.  I’ll grill him next time I see him.
BenBajarin	700332997308854272	2016-02-18T14:56:12	Agree. 
BenBajarin	700329288659120128	2016-02-18T14:41:28	reverse_swing3 I saw it. Wrote about it for subscribers today.
BenBajarin	700323563962658816	2016-02-18T14:18:43	A great “here’s how it actually works” review of NextBit Robin Review from Lucas_Matney  
BenBajarin	700327343953354752	2016-02-18T14:33:44	Great read on Apple Chip design efforts. One of the most strategically important things they did in the last decade. 
BenBajarin	700185365093576704	2016-02-18T05:09:34	..enable chip designers is the key opening sentence in this ARM press release around modem architecture.   
BenBajarin	700181418995875840	2016-02-18T04:53:53	magicsilicon yes.
BenBajarin	700180291474710529	2016-02-18T04:49:24	Just had an encounter with a person who still has dial up internet.. We often forget these people exist.. Or can’t believe it.
BenBajarin	699980267289776128	2016-02-17T15:34:35	On the heels of Valentine's Day, here's my most recent editorial on how digitaldata is redefining dating norms 
BenBajarin	700160756059283456	2016-02-18T03:31:47	This EMV thing is going great.   
BenBajarin	700052863725105152	2016-02-17T20:23:03	ZhugeEX agree. How fast I’m not sure.
BenBajarin	700052475051520001	2016-02-17T20:21:31	ZhugeEX yep. Don’t see that changing any time soon.. Huge gap with no middle showing in China yet.
BenBajarin	700051887815467012	2016-02-17T20:19:11	ZhugeEX and ah, I thought that was a Q4 chart.
BenBajarin	700051728272482304	2016-02-17T20:18:33	ZhugeEX 58.2 for the year is my tally..
BenBajarin	700051135390830592	2016-02-17T20:16:11	ZhugeEX yes but I was also just talking Q4 sales.
BenBajarin	698831590915502080	2016-02-14T11:30:09	WeChat had more mobile transactions over just Chinese New Year than PayPal had during 2015 
BenBajarin	700050030485336064	2016-02-17T20:11:48	I have Apple higher than 13.4% of sales in mainland Q4 but the ASP point remains..   
BenBajarin	700012030464491520	2016-02-17T17:40:48	Garmin Soars 14% on Q4 Beat; Raymond James Likes the Margin Upside - Tech Trader Daily - Barron's GRMN AAPL FIT 
BenBajarin	700006206157369344	2016-02-17T17:17:39	janchip I’m told in villages closer to Nairobi have some solar but not way out where he is.
BenBajarin	700006111215136769	2016-02-17T17:17:17	janchip Nice thanks for sharing. Similarly he tells me a guy has a battery in his hut and people pay him. He is super rural though.
BenBajarin	700001977267163136	2016-02-17T17:00:51	NitiBhan despite all the other points, the data issue is how much it costs to do something meaningful.. Africa is my case study currently.
BenBajarin	700000458731982848	2016-02-17T16:54:49	NitiBhan yep. Already factored that into my analysis.
BenBajarin	699999999401156608	2016-02-17T16:52:59	NitiBhan still roughly 2 billion feature phone users out there. Smartphone growth in 2016 9%..  It has slowed dramatically.
BenBajarin	699999821076168704	2016-02-17T16:52:17	sternesiech they forecast 70% by end of 2016.
BenBajarin	699999393278111744	2016-02-17T16:50:35	The encrypted Internet is coming. 
BenBajarin	699998213995036672	2016-02-17T16:45:54	NitiBhan this is ultimately why the growth of the next billion will take much longer than many realize.
BenBajarin	699998143908216833	2016-02-17T16:45:37	NitiBhan eliminate the word monthly.  My point is the service fee whatever it is is more a barrier than a one time handset cost.
BenBajarin	699996824858292224	2016-02-17T16:40:23	NitiBhan sorry you misunderstood me.
BenBajarin	699996534612426752	2016-02-17T16:39:13	NitiBhan my point was the monthly fee whatever it is is more a barrier than the handset.. Add charging.. etc..
BenBajarin	699996009775001600	2016-02-17T16:37:08	NitiBhan same point. It is the service charge that is the barrier to how much or little or at all..
BenBajarin	699995708628144129	2016-02-17T16:35:56	ZhugeEX yes. I just tweeted I could defend ~40% of those LTE connections are iPhones. Possibly conservative also.
BenBajarin	699995335209275392	2016-02-17T16:34:27	Of the 1 billion LTE subscriptions, my estimate has Apple to have around ~40% of it. Possibly conservative but defensible.
BenBajarin	699994996468875264	2016-02-17T16:33:07	ZhugeEX I have.. To the buy side only since it is a pretty valuable model. I have it by country also.
BenBajarin	699994745569808385	2016-02-17T16:32:07	ZhugeEX Better, I have an installed base estimate by model..
BenBajarin	699993949595774976	2016-02-17T16:28:57	ZhugeEX I might have convinced myself to build a model of what Appel’s share of that LTE sub base is..
BenBajarin	699993569629614080	2016-02-17T16:27:26	ZhugeEX They are still saying around 1 billion.. So perhaps hasn’t grown much since Nov..
BenBajarin	699992908129107970	2016-02-17T16:24:49	davezatz FOMO is a powerful thing I’m told.  BTW finally got my sleep number.  So happy with it.
BenBajarin	699992774024699905	2016-02-17T16:24:17	Now around 1 billion LTE subscriptions according to Ericsson. Apple likely has a good chunk of that. Hence Cook’s LTE point on growth..
BenBajarin	699991815353606144	2016-02-17T16:20:28	Hmm.. The horror of internet speed delays. 
BenBajarin	699991297164095488	2016-02-17T16:18:25	Apparently not getting our messaging or social network updates is stressful. 
BenBajarin	699990638012465152	2016-02-17T16:15:47	janchip and that cost is for a feature phone so once a week.. Vs. smartphone once a day.
BenBajarin	699990563559346177	2016-02-17T16:15:30	janchip yeah, this one is also a core issue. My brother lives in a village in Kenya, says people pay $1.50-$2.00 each charge.
BenBajarin	699984284455559168	2016-02-17T15:50:33	semil I think you are right. Also, dealing with as many pub investors as I do, many private co’s aren’t good public ones..
BenBajarin	699983880988659714	2016-02-17T15:48:56	Now this is a smart “slight pivot” for Leap Motion.   
BenBajarin	699983051355324417	2016-02-17T15:45:39	The issue for the next billion is not the price of the handset as much as it is the price of the monthly fee.   
BenBajarin	699979544036450304	2016-02-17T15:31:42	MarkDMill Conspiracy theorists note such a thing would have been needed for China to let them in in the first place. Not sure I agree.
BenBajarin	699979349156442112	2016-02-17T15:30:56	don_mcarthur yes. As far as we know it is the same OS though. So if such a backdoor exists for China than it exists and Cook is lying.
BenBajarin	699978907366219778	2016-02-17T15:29:11	bennyj80 worth noting as a case study why Android One did not work as well as thought.  Mature Indian consumers want value not cheap.
BenBajarin	699978713178329088	2016-02-17T15:28:24	bennyj80 Great question. Long answer needed.. But entry level customers are different than those who are more mature.
BenBajarin	699978385678700548	2016-02-17T15:27:06	degusta yes. This is the heart of the matter. Can the Gov even force Apple to bake it in, etc.. Very tough questions.
BenBajarin	699978225519194114	2016-02-17T15:26:28	Also, there were countries where iPhone penetration is low that ranked security much higher than other countries.   
BenBajarin	699977761377505280	2016-02-17T15:24:37	Also worth noting, in my smartphone study, those who considered switching to iPhone listed security/privacy as a top reason.
BenBajarin	699977631463116800	2016-02-17T15:24:06	Philosophically we will have to land on whether a version of iOS should exist which can break hardware encryption.
BenBajarin	699976865562251264	2016-02-17T15:21:04	degusta So the argument is whether such a thing should even exist.
BenBajarin	699976811157938177	2016-02-17T15:20:51	degusta not sure. But the main issue here is it would take a special version of iOS which does not exist to do this.
BenBajarin	699976126764965888	2016-02-17T15:18:08	Friends in India, if you can spare a few minutes from time to time to help me study your market I’d appreciate it.  
BenBajarin	699975450232115200	2016-02-17T15:15:26	degusta it seems its a hardware lock. Meaning you have to physically break into the hardware..
BenBajarin	699972348837916672	2016-02-17T15:03:07	I said it when the iPhone 5s and Touch ID came out that security as a service would be a main story for Apple.
BenBajarin	699972138636193792	2016-02-17T15:02:17	Basically if we were talking any iPhone with a secure enclave the FBI would be out of luck.   
BenBajarin	699952615413587968	2016-02-17T13:44:42	Very respectful, clear message from tim_cook it is all about setting a precedent  
BenBajarin	699825313090510848	2016-02-17T05:18:51	robynhannah better let me have them to keep them safe..
BenBajarin	699774459838750720	2016-02-17T01:56:47	Many interesting narratives circling this. Many philosophical questions to work out.   
BenBajarin	699757116836327424	2016-02-17T00:47:52	JonLombardo here was original tweet. And thanks.   
BenBajarin	699747064104615936	2016-02-17T00:07:55	I hate to spoil a good headline and CIRPs research but the 74% number of 6 and above is not correct.  
BenBajarin	699743600897187840	2016-02-16T23:54:09	@DamnPhd thanks.
BenBajarin	699742447086096384	2016-02-16T23:49:34	Anchor feels like early Twitter but audio. Needs more curation but I like the idea and emphasis on short form audio media.
BenBajarin	699736999587000320	2016-02-16T23:27:55	Listen to "Thoughts on streaming services. Data on US market."  ⚓
BenBajarin	699736223493926912	2016-02-16T23:24:50	What I wrote today for subscribers also explains why paying for streaming music will be a slow road.   
BenBajarin	699734768749969408	2016-02-16T23:19:03	Via my quarterly snapshot research, less than 2% of baby boomers are using Apple Music. Millennials still favoring Spotify.
BenBajarin	699688655724503040	2016-02-16T20:15:49	ShawnKing well I think you should have a whole series called this is why I hate people :)
BenBajarin	699634300040269824	2016-02-16T16:39:50	On thing I’ve been wrestling with regarding music, is how it seems its role has changed with millennials and Gen Z during formative years.
BenBajarin	699633862196867072	2016-02-16T16:38:05	Shared a quick thought on Anchor.. on Anchor.. Curation vs. random is the question for this type of stuff.    
BenBajarin	699633522886070274	2016-02-16T16:36:45	Listen to my wave  ⚓
BenBajarin	699623312175968256	2016-02-16T15:56:10	Interesting plug for VR from Good Morning America. Normals watch this show so relevant from an awareness standpoint.
BenBajarin	699617457246371841	2016-02-16T15:32:54	CapturetheOcean yes your on the right track. Where it really gets interesting, though, is what it takes to shake off the debt.
BenBajarin	699615418403594244	2016-02-16T15:24:48	Now in subscriber inboxes.    Make sure you have had your coffee and thinking caps on.   
BenBajarin	699612607586525185	2016-02-16T15:13:38	Also we will see if either benefit from the fat plug the Grammys gave music subscription services last night.  
BenBajarin	699392615855185921	2016-02-16T00:39:28	Interpretation?   
BenBajarin	699388927212331008	2016-02-16T00:24:48	Anyone have positive feedback from owning a Donkey?
BenBajarin	699388847050764288	2016-02-16T00:24:29	Ents are real.   
BenBajarin	699334778512764928	2016-02-15T20:49:38	PatrickMoorhead sure. My point is the concept of voice as a platform is sound.
BenBajarin	699330442076360704	2016-02-15T20:32:24	I use the Echo to control all sorts of things in my house. Total agreement in voice as a platform.   
BenBajarin	699326886631989248	2016-02-15T20:18:17	flavio82ams the metaphor is different. I have not issue with it and it fits my workflow better than the others.
BenBajarin	699255726431039490	2016-02-15T15:35:31	Android ASP could drop below $200 for 2016 as well.    
BenBajarin	699253159651209217	2016-02-15T15:25:19	This is a good one.   
BenBajarin	699239395564482560	2016-02-15T14:30:37	jjhikes NiuB ChinaGeeks sure. Those companies also wer over indexed on business market not consumer. Consumer has different dynamics.
BenBajarin	699238531810471937	2016-02-15T14:27:11	jjhikes NiuB ChinaGeeks all brands can fall yes. In just saying it isn’t inevitable.
BenBajarin	699238275324588032	2016-02-15T14:26:10	thyechean I still hear consumers there doing everything they can to get an iPhone.
BenBajarin	699238018687721472	2016-02-15T14:25:09	jjhikes NiuB ChinaGeeks I don’t think that is an absolute in consumer markets. Lots of brands maintain ther lure in consumer.
BenBajarin	699102414499000320	2016-02-15T05:26:18	This should be obvious but for so many they simply can’t grasp it’s reality. Charlie spells it out.   
BenBajarin	698985044170280960	2016-02-14T21:39:55	magicsilicon stevecheney I think that is what Steve meant. I covered this for subs on the new economics of the law.
BenBajarin	698899230060990465	2016-02-14T15:58:56	stevecheney economics is the issue. Hard to make the investment when few customers can pay the premium.
BenBajarin	698814031956615168	2016-02-14T10:20:23	The mobile internet is expensive. Really expensive.

BenBajarin	698401384341737472	2016-02-13T07:00:40	Friend told me he couldn’t go all iPad as his PC because he needed a file manager. I then showed him this. 
BenBajarin	698399304638042112	2016-02-13T06:52:24	BenedictEvans real key is to know how many use more than one iTunes account and how many share one account. A stat I may have by the way :)
BenBajarin	698398248491360256	2016-02-13T06:48:12	If I recall Vinyl sales are up also. There is a certain experience in the analog world that is still valuable.  
BenBajarin	698397859947778048	2016-02-13T06:46:40	FeitaInc hmmm. I’ll need to look into it.

BenBajarin	698397582440079360	2016-02-13T06:45:33	thyechean emphasis on personal.
BenBajarin	698397530359377920	2016-02-13T06:45:21	thyechean definition in general isn’t helpful here. But I am making a distinction between what is truly a personal computer and what is not
BenBajarin	698390856408018944	2016-02-13T06:18:50	thyechean nope. It runs apps, has a smart assistant, can be used to pay for things etc.I strongly discourage a rigid definition of computer
BenBajarin	698386313674797056	2016-02-13T06:00:47	thyechean that isn’t what defines a personal computer.
BenBajarin	698352757523107840	2016-02-13T03:47:26	reverius42 balajis in terms of platform share of annual devices sold yes.
BenBajarin	698349140699250688	2016-02-13T03:33:04	thyechean why? Both are personal computing platforms..
BenBajarin	698318591846776832	2016-02-13T01:31:41	Another way to look at it.. Platform share in the enterprise computing era vs. the consumer era. 
BenBajarin	698308296818577408	2016-02-13T00:50:46	Platform / hardware installed base.. Platforms, platforms, and more platforms.. Soon VR platforms.. 
BenBajarin	698306762965815296	2016-02-13T00:44:40	Final year computing platform share. Yes iOS includes Apple Watch but not Apple TV. 
BenBajarin	698289866828681216	2016-02-12T23:37:32	elenaneira Yes.
BenBajarin	698287532316823552	2016-02-12T23:28:15	When messages or notifications are delayed between devices it is almost always when I know I have poor broadband.  
BenBajarin	698287379249909760	2016-02-12T23:27:39	I am yet to figure out how to quantify this, but I can directly tie my iCloud syncing issue between devices to poor broadband speeds.
BenBajarin	698285992101306369	2016-02-12T23:22:08	I interpret this relative to the device satisfaction.. People love these devices..   
BenBajarin	698284790017994752	2016-02-12T23:17:22	Interesting poll.    
BenBajarin	698214003617722368	2016-02-12T18:36:05	Yep, today's fitness platforms are shoes.

BenBajarin	698215265994035200	2016-02-12T18:41:06	Apple saying they just passed 11m paying Apple Music subs.   200,000 messages per second sent via messages app.
BenBajarin	698214587783577600	2016-02-12T18:38:24	There are 782M iCloud users

BenBajarin	698195548407398400	2016-02-12T17:22:45	One of the main highlights from my wearable study.   
BenBajarin	698195442790588416	2016-02-12T17:22:20	The unanimous feature every wearable owner (if product supports it) said was more valuable than they thought it would be was.. Notifications
BenBajarin	698194611555020800	2016-02-12T17:19:01	iPad higher than Android tablet I mean..    
BenBajarin	698194468374052864	2016-02-12T17:18:27	macintux tablet. Sorry should have made that clear.
BenBajarin	698192915634323460	2016-02-12T17:12:17	There are 7 countries in the over 30 we track where iPad installed base /active use is higher than Android.
BenBajarin	698192143924367360	2016-02-12T17:09:13	Seems likely then, if/when new ones come out the first gen goes to $249

BenBajarin	697924803726946304	2016-02-11T23:26:54	ChrisHumphreys_ modem not camera.
BenBajarin	697892275729276928	2016-02-11T21:17:39	.Mitchandmacs also covers up lack of good SoC design. Good designers can do more with less cores.

BenBajarin	697863966068908032	2016-02-11T19:25:09	The new Quartz text style news app is cool but also showcases why we need true AI. I want to be able to use more than canned responses.

BenBajarin	697859766333222912	2016-02-11T19:08:28	markgurman maybe. We have no actual idea! ;)
BenBajarin	697859236496183296	2016-02-11T19:06:22	markgurman In reality many people don’t want cars to be silent. Especially car people. Want them to sound cool.
BenBajarin	697858972439564289	2016-02-11T19:05:19	markgurman Check out the sound on the Harley electric prototype :) tesla also has custom sounds.. Some very loud.
BenBajarin	697858636249337856	2016-02-11T19:03:59	A number of EVs on the market emit a sound for safety reasons.   
BenBajarin	697858546986160128	2016-02-11T19:03:37	markgurman a number of EVs on the market do. It tested well so you don’t run over someone in the parking lot because they can’t hear you
BenBajarin	697846649784143872	2016-02-11T18:16:21	kiggle FarshadNayeri yes we will do services in NY as well and Boston I believe is on the stop.

BenBajarin	697791463795458048	2016-02-11T14:37:03	Verxion ok. So would you say having used a keyboard with iPad prior made you more likely to consider Pro as a laptop replacement?
BenBajarin	697789765551157248	2016-02-11T14:30:19	Verxion had you used a keyboard with iPad before? And if so had using a keyboard prior helped you consider it as a potential replacement?
BenBajarin	697789191782989824	2016-02-11T14:28:02	Verxion what did you decide on going iPad Pro only? Do you mean as laptop replacement.
BenBajarin	697787523553058820	2016-02-11T14:21:24	Verxion I like where you are going. Need to think more on this. I’m actually a bit more interested in the loss vs gain of iPhone vs. iPad.

BenBajarin	696205684505911297	2016-02-07T05:35:44	AaronNichol I don’t think so. Strategically it’s a hook. As is FaceTime. Friends and family on iOS a powerful lock in

BenBajarin	696162280161972229	2016-02-07T02:43:16	gustojunk I tried Morpheus for a few hours last week. That was pretty comfy and well balanced. Especially given I was in a firefight…

BenBajarin	696161237172813826	2016-02-07T02:39:07	Interesting to think about how iMessage is a top five messaging app by number of DAU.
BenBajarin	696160737601794050	2016-02-07T02:37:08	gustojunk I watched 3 hours of Netflix on it last night. Comfort is fine you sort of forget about it but could be more comfy as well.

BenBajarin	696155993642655744	2016-02-07T02:18:17	This Apple ecosystem consumer study I did confirms not only is it unlikely consumers leave Apple’s ecosystem. Once in it they go deeper.

BenBajarin	696152198896455680	2016-02-07T02:03:12	JeffBessling yes tough call. I asked use personally so..
BenBajarin	696151971288338433	2016-02-07T02:02:18	PatrickMoorhead in active use. Individual not household.  I asked household also..

BenBajarin	696151582153375744	2016-02-07T02:00:45	JeffBessling individual. I asked household also in a second question.
BenBajarin	696150370398007296	2016-02-07T01:55:56	I have this stat thanks to a study I did but question to the twitter verse.. How many Apple products does the average iPhone owner have?

BenBajarin	695749274915606528	2016-02-05T23:22:08	inner_scorecard I think that’s right. Just a slower curve but perhaps a bigger one.
BenBajarin	695743255267246082	2016-02-05T22:58:12	kirkburgess philiped So I’d say i’m quite interested in this part. So far China sales have not been great.. Compared to US.
BenBajarin	695728673895231488	2016-02-05T22:00:16	franzvonloewe BenedictEvans quite a long list of reasons from our study on why people stick with iOS. Not so long a list for other guys.
BenBajarin	695727736787054592	2016-02-05T21:56:33	Finally got my own hard data around iPhone loyalty rates and re-purchase intent. Fascinating comparing with other OEMs..
BenBajarin	695727559712116736	2016-02-05T21:55:50	franzvonloewe BenedictEvans yes, Huawei in Samsung in a ring together with all the other Android OEMs. Apple sits and watches.
BenBajarin	695726102652833792	2016-02-05T21:50:03	manicakes yes. But that has to be balanced with the fact it is truly new.. It’s unprecedented to have the truly new sell this amount..
BenBajarin	695725097143787520	2016-02-05T21:46:03	The iPad benefitted from the familiarity of iPhone. Anyone who studies adoption cycles knows how hard selling brand new categories is.
BenBajarin	695724791483932672	2016-02-05T21:44:50	Seems the Apple Watch is just off the iPad’s path first three quarters.    Still not bad for a brand new category..

BenBajarin	695698688883060736	2016-02-05T20:01:07	parth2eets I think you are right they will focus more on high-end. Worry less about volume and more on profit.

BenBajarin	695690010121490432	2016-02-05T19:26:38	Via lots of conversations with smartphone OEMs who know the global market.. “Huawei is the new Samsung.. “  Been saying this for years..
BenBajarin	695689759318941696	2016-02-05T19:25:38	karangoel jjhikes mims yeah I think $300-$400 likely the sweet spot for very good spec Android. Good for Huawei bad for Samsung..

BenBajarin	695652263017054208	2016-02-05T16:56:38	dtellom sure. Still have to be careful with it if paints the wrong picture… Especially to build a forward model..
BenBajarin	695651572747935744	2016-02-05T16:53:54	dtellom I have methods to do both. Network data for active devices.. Survey’s to know who owns what
BenBajarin	695651048069865475	2016-02-05T16:51:49	dtellom no because I specify if you have two which is your primary.. Also very low % who have two..
BenBajarin	695650958055858176	2016-02-05T16:51:27	Good primer on LTE-U.    
BenBajarin	695650297415241728	2016-02-05T16:48:50	dtellom ah, thought they were lower than that. Yes close. iPhone not close. In every study I have iPhone come back a hair more than Android
BenBajarin	695648893258715137	2016-02-05T16:43:15	dtellom they have it much lower than 80%.. That is not even including kids..
BenBajarin	695648830583234561	2016-02-05T16:43:00	dtellom yes but just in general.. I’ve done large US mainstream studies and SP penetration always comes back 80%..
BenBajarin	695648287378927616	2016-02-05T16:40:50	We get people don’t believe Apple can do it, but I’m optimistic on services upside.   
BenBajarin	695647166367334400	2016-02-05T16:36:23	dtellom this is the true limitation of their survey work vs. mine and my other data. Fairly frustrating because its so inaccurate..
BenBajarin	695640208474116096	2016-02-05T16:08:44	dtellom seems like a full scale analysis of their methodology is needed but who has the time for that.
BenBajarin	695640114181963776	2016-02-05T16:08:22	dtellom it is honestly remarkable how low their total smartphone shares are.. I wish I knew how to reconcile their problem..

BenBajarin	694256523141210112	2016-02-01T20:30:28	I agree with GGV’s thesis. Also social commerce makes where the inventory is held moot.

BenBajarin	694247454921793536	2016-02-01T19:54:26	eric_analytics maybe it doesn’t have to. Think about game consoles…
BenBajarin	694241331959304192	2016-02-01T19:30:06	oditorium my thinking is the dynamics that typically drive standardization don’t necessarily exist in big global consumer markets.

BenBajarin	693205439941468162	2016-01-29T22:53:50	kirkburgess gruber reneritchie yep that holds true. But helpful to see the many markets were iPhone is over $1000

BenBajarin	693077696494960640	2016-01-29T14:26:14	Mckendy19 interestingly, biggest adds for iPhone in US came from feature phone owners getting first smartphone.
BenBajarin	693077552651325441	2016-01-29T14:25:39	Mckendy19 increasing, however, total sales are slowing so actual unit numbers are flatish..
BenBajarin	693076634891517952	2016-01-29T14:22:01	Mckendy19 yep
BenBajarin	693075903807516672	2016-01-29T14:19:06	Mckendy19 yep.
BenBajarin	693074890186838016	2016-01-29T14:15:05	Mckendy19 lots of folks focus on that but the nature of my work is device sales.. So relevant but both are required for context.

BenBajarin	692928886573760512	2016-01-29T04:34:55	Despite poor distribution, and extremely high prices in the region, Apple keeps growing there.   
BenBajarin	692896764844584960	2016-01-29T02:27:16	miketheiron yes that is correct and certainly possible.. May not matter.
BenBajarin	692895472155922433	2016-01-29T02:22:08	miketheiron well plus that 1 billion active devices was a bit higher than my model, so lasting in market a really long time..
BenBajarin	692894823951372289	2016-01-29T02:19:34	miketheiron must be because the question was what their personal/primary smartphone was.. Not looking at sales just ownership.
BenBajarin	692893528679018496	2016-01-29T02:14:25	ryanreith yeah makes sense. Given what I heard from fleet sales of CPO iPhones from carriers, that’s becoming a big number.. To business.
BenBajarin	692892469671755776	2016-01-29T02:10:12	ryanreith it was personal smartphone owned/used.. Which is the more important metric..
BenBajarin	692892101885894661	2016-01-29T02:08:45	ryanreith so close that i’m not actually sure which one is slightly ahead. Could be iPhone, could be Android not sure..
BenBajarin	692891973225570308	2016-01-29T02:08:14	ryanreith just completed a huge study.. Asked which they own and neck and neck..

BenBajarin	692565705770823685	2016-01-28T04:31:46	robertmclaws cause all the companies you love trust my stuff :).  Main point is that is one chart of a story… Tablets different story.
BenBajarin	692561958458036224	2016-01-28T04:16:52	robertmclaws your missing the point. Adding 10m units to total annual PC sales makes no difference. Smartphone 1.4b annual PC ~300m
BenBajarin	692561171749212161	2016-01-28T04:13:45	robertmclaws add those and smartphone still sold 100m more in the Q than the full year of PC sales..

BenBajarin	692479991850930178	2016-01-27T22:51:10	JamieSkella I like this thinking.  Could use some fleshing out but seems like with music, TV would also?
BenBajarin	692479325615030272	2016-01-27T22:48:31	jniccolai just one of those things I need to see happen before I believe it. ARM has made no dent yet..
BenBajarin	692478958152126464	2016-01-27T22:47:03	Colin_Sebastian undoubtedly, but the point is that looks to go to FB not Google.
BenBajarin	692478875666878465	2016-01-27T22:46:44	Analyst’s model on FB is 8% of total media time spent is on Facebook..
BenBajarin	692478522141622273	2016-01-27T22:45:19	my .2c.. I’ll believe it when I see it.   
BenBajarin	692478331284033537	2016-01-27T22:44:34	Google really needs to be concerned about Facebook taking all their upside on video ad dollars.
BenBajarin	692477110288543745	2016-01-27T22:39:43	modestproposal1 I figured.  On that point though, Apple needs their Watson engine..
BenBajarin	692476387089879040	2016-01-27T22:36:50	modestproposal1 I assume your being cheeky?
BenBajarin	692476024299347968	2016-01-27T22:35:24	A lot of really good commentary coming from the FB call. I may be getting more bullish.

BenBajarin	692473720296882177	2016-01-27T22:26:15	Just for fun I’ll point out Apple made almost as much money from services ($5.5b) as FB did total revenue in the Dec Q.
BenBajarin	692471752207790087	2016-01-27T22:18:25	So FB could cross 2 billion users maybe late 2017 it seems.

BenBajarin	692463037958201345	2016-01-27T21:43:48	The FB earnings slide I always want to see. Each region ARPU is growing. Very important metric. 
BenBajarin	692462124766007298	2016-01-27T21:40:10	brianshall jandawson it may be that FB just passes the transaction to Apple Pay or Android Pay, where someone has a trusted wallet.
BenBajarin	692461901637423104	2016-01-27T21:39:17	And interesting that mobile has challenged Google but enabled Facebook.   
BenBajarin	692461605313851392	2016-01-27T21:38:06	jandawson brianshall yes I get that.
BenBajarin	692460540346654723	2016-01-27T21:33:52	brianshall jandawson I’m more aligned with Brian here. My concern is the behavior doesn’t happen, FB hired for a different job.
BenBajarin	692458611558256641	2016-01-27T21:26:12	FB should hit a billion daily active mobile users in the March Q June at the latest.. 934m at end of Dec..
BenBajarin	692457736127287296	2016-01-27T21:22:44	jandawson my concern here is FBs users aren’t behaving in a way they want them to, to be taken seriously as a payment merchant..
BenBajarin	692457126028038144	2016-01-27T21:20:18	Crazy to see Facebook’s ad revenue growth continue to accelerate 
BenBajarin	692457056075288576	2016-01-27T21:20:02	Facebook MAUs up 14% to 1.59 billion. Mobile ad revenue up 69% YoY. Payments and “other” fell though…
BenBajarin	692431433831329793	2016-01-27T19:38:13	Exactly how it went down with landline phone hardware decades ago..   
BenBajarin	692430159467712513	2016-01-27T19:33:09	sameer_singh17 yep, as is mine. Lots will have trouble making money. Big implications on the model for other SP OEMs.

BenBajarin	692380753846362112	2016-01-27T16:16:50	benthompson dasan agree. This dec quarter likely hits another super cycle.
BenBajarin	692377924444368896	2016-01-27T16:05:35	jonfortt yep. And knowing when those economies turn is nearly impossible. I do believe Apple is well positioned for when they do though.

BenBajarin	692118344221212677	2016-01-26T22:54:06	EspectadorD yes anything higher than 5s.

BenBajarin	692112691285135361	2016-01-26T22:31:39	So Android switching rate was likely higher than 30% then.. But overall market slowed.. so 30% of less devices than one year ago.

BenBajarin	692105102769782789	2016-01-26T22:01:29	harrymccracken they sold less than $1m likely in that time frame. It is likely a 1-2m per quarter type of product for now.

BenBajarin	692094724396613632	2016-01-26T21:20:15	DonaldRichard semil because it will become increasingly harder for many companies to give them what they want/expect.

BenBajarin	692043884793171968	2016-01-26T17:58:14	TheLeeBase good point. ;)
BenBajarin	692043744556642304	2016-01-26T17:57:40	GiuGhi yes. However, on the flip side, we are seeing FB become a more “passive” network at large.. So the analysis is of “actives.”
BenBajarin	692041743059931136	2016-01-26T17:49:43	TheLeeBase ha so true. Well I’ve been in this industry for 18 and my father for 35 so we have him beat ;)
BenBajarin	692041230549528576	2016-01-26T17:47:41	GiuGhi say an active is 2-3 posts per day by average FB user. Lots of those.. But say average Twitter is 20+. Smaller group but more active
BenBajarin	692040470243840000	2016-01-26T17:44:40	BrandonLive the conversation stuff would still happen. I’m just saying someone like me could use some specific tools they develop.

BenBajarin	692038557402136576	2016-01-26T17:37:04	rjonesy agree. Perhaps those better for personal website or something vs. integration in client.

BenBajarin	692037980890886144	2016-01-26T17:34:46	rjonesy my vision is you wouldn’t integrate. Twitter AI would see the product mentioned and insert buy button..
BenBajarin	692037812799975425	2016-01-26T17:34:06	AngelLamuno I like game theory.. So I have one where Apple ends up buying IBM.  Thus getting Watson…I know I’m crazy.
BenBajarin	692037317104545792	2016-01-26T17:32:08	Good example of when an integrated buy button would work. Since I just bought one..   
BenBajarin	692036709630873600	2016-01-26T17:29:43	AngelLamuno I’m not sure.. But I do think Apple could go a long way by getting closer with either IBM or Microsoft on this stuff.
BenBajarin	692036403845140480	2016-01-26T17:28:30	BrandonLive I just believe true producers need different tools/experience than pure consuming.

BenBajarin	692028791179210752	2016-01-26T16:58:15	The best thing and jack can do is a job to be done analysis of both Twitter’s producers and of its consumers. Hired for different reasons.
BenBajarin	692028215632596992	2016-01-26T16:55:58	Carnage4Life jandawson I can quantify that Twitters users are more engaged in ways they can better monetize than FB…
BenBajarin	692027974363709441	2016-01-26T16:55:01	WhatTheBit charge for polls, deeper analytics, etc..  Producer tools for audio and TV are not cheap.
BenBajarin	692027788786700289	2016-01-26T16:54:16	WhatTheBit I’d charge the pros/producers to have this capability and make it elegantly expandable for the consumer version.
BenBajarin	692027534590881792	2016-01-26T16:53:16	jandawson yep. Lots spinning around in my head on this.
BenBajarin	692027071279673344	2016-01-26T16:51:25	jandawson well world today.. Advertising is about to change dramatically. Only a few ready to compete for this shift..
BenBajarin	692026645448765441	2016-01-26T16:49:44	RealDarrenCohen I’m not sure how :( I followed that verified account thing and nothing..
BenBajarin	692026549269172225	2016-01-26T16:49:21	WhatTheBit well I sort of use Tweetbot this way. But better analytics, expanded tweets, maybe more. I’d pay for that.
BenBajarin	692026289474015232	2016-01-26T16:48:19	I’d love it if twitter had a dedicated product for pros to produce and one dedicated to consume.  I’d use both.
BenBajarin	692026020543639552	2016-01-26T16:47:15	Aside.. I love watching Roger Federer play tennis..
BenBajarin	692025105744965632	2016-01-26T16:43:37	zzbar jack I hope they don’t.  But worst case scenario.
BenBajarin	692025039198093312	2016-01-26T16:43:21	chrisdomico I think things have to get a lot worse before it gets to that. But should they be bought its only FB and Google who make sense
BenBajarin	692024703825784832	2016-01-26T16:42:01	This is basically the case I’ll try to make.   
BenBajarin	692024477509550080	2016-01-26T16:41:07	I also recognize my thesis on twitter goes against some of what my friend benthompson wrote today.   
BenBajarin	692024280754757633	2016-01-26T16:40:20	If my theory is right about Twitters valuable user base, then Google could buy them and perhaps thwart FB monetization effort.

BenBajarin	692020150908792833	2016-01-26T16:23:55	I think I can argue, that for a user base that is profitable… Twitter has the more active/profitable users than Facebook..  FB has scale..
BenBajarin	692019655297228800	2016-01-26T16:21:57	WhatTheBit mims ok just making sure. I agree but was just checking.
BenBajarin	692019547612655616	2016-01-26T16:21:31	tomiahonen let’s just check back in 2017…
BenBajarin	692019343907954688	2016-01-26T16:20:43	tomiahonen the world changes… markets mature.. etc. etc.
BenBajarin	692019232473636864	2016-01-26T16:20:16	tomiahonen I’d love to have a discussion of potential not throw shade on it.
BenBajarin	692019089573679104	2016-01-26T16:19:42	mims ok so is Queet a thing?
BenBajarin	692018818969776128	2016-01-26T16:18:38	tomiahonen let’s just agree we see the world different and move on..
BenBajarin	692018407135322112	2016-01-26T16:16:59	BenBajarin and there is no viable market for smart watches. It was a silly fad of 2015 that will soon die out. A technological cul de sac
BenBajarin	692018287094304768	2016-01-26T16:16:31	tomiahonen again, your stuck in the short term. I’m trying to think 10 years out or longer…
BenBajarin	692017845417345024	2016-01-26T16:14:46	tomiahonen look to the future Tomi! Not just what you see today.
BenBajarin	692017403635458048	2016-01-26T16:13:00	Gartenberg you must have a defective modem or something. I use the edge and get through a day..
BenBajarin	692017115570655232	2016-01-26T16:11:52	tomiahonen watch is in fact miniaturization…
BenBajarin	692017022956343297	2016-01-26T16:11:29	tomiahonen yes exactly.. and we have to start somewhere to evolve into that direction.  My point is watch could be what gets it there.
BenBajarin	692016908942462976	2016-01-26T16:11:02	tomiahonen why can’t the wrist worn be the path to what is next even if not in current watch form?
BenBajarin	692016827275186177	2016-01-26T16:10:43	tomiahonen watch will have modem, voice, ties to artificial intelligent assistants, etc…. Long way to go…
BenBajarin	692016728755142657	2016-01-26T16:10:19	tomiahonen so with AI, voice, new compute input paradigms, why can’t I wear my primary computer?
BenBajarin	692016411514789888	2016-01-26T16:09:04	tomiahonen yes because the phone idea was a mature concept…
BenBajarin	692016158690529280	2016-01-26T16:08:03	tomiahonen here, read this on my study specifically on dissatisfied watch owners so you know I look at both sides.  
BenBajarin	692015852699320320	2016-01-26T16:06:50	tomiahonen in 20 years will the smartphone still exist?
BenBajarin	692015562537332736	2016-01-26T16:05:41	tomiahonen phones had the benefit of a long adoption curve. The phone is decades old concept.  This concept is brand new…
BenBajarin	692015104552890372	2016-01-26T16:03:52	tomiahonen I’m defending potential Tomi. Because I believe in innovation..
BenBajarin	692015040761765889	2016-01-26T16:03:37	tomiahonen we focused on studying Apple Watch owners who were NOT iSheep. Not early adopters… They love it.
BenBajarin	692014812025323520	2016-01-26T16:02:42	tomiahonen just because you see no value in it does not mean other genuine consumers will. This attitude that you don’t like it absurd.
BenBajarin	692013748966404096	2016-01-26T15:58:29	tomiahonen $10 billion in first year revenue doesn’t sound like a bad idea. Now I don’t advise others compete with Apple for now.. No money
BenBajarin	692013535908356097	2016-01-26T15:57:38	tomiahonen I’m disappointed in your lack of open-mindedness. I like to look for potential not kill something before it’s born
BenBajarin	692013217195757568	2016-01-26T15:56:22	tomiahonen kirkburgess roivod it seems you know nothing of my firms history.. Oh well. Lost cause.
BenBajarin	692013159368929280	2016-01-26T15:56:08	tomiahonen kirkburgess roivod so your against innovation? Or the possibility of it?
BenBajarin	692013013000269825	2016-01-26T15:55:33	tomiahonen kirkburgess roivod what I’m standing up against is your inability to present a scenario where it succeeds.
BenBajarin	692012892384731136	2016-01-26T15:55:05	tomiahonen kirkburgess roivod I’ve presented all sides of the coin. The possibility it fails and the possibility it succeeds.
BenBajarin	692012675685986304	2016-01-26T15:54:13	tomiahonen kirkburgess roivod if you study history you know markets change, behaviors change, things that didn’t work can work again.
BenBajarin	692011955612061696	2016-01-26T15:51:21	tomiahonen kirkburgess roivod well the study is ongoing every quarter every year. All behavioral research.  So we will see as it grows up
BenBajarin	692011853027803136	2016-01-26T15:50:57	tomiahonen kirkburgess roivod I believe a good analyst should present all sides of the coin.
BenBajarin	692011783930793984	2016-01-26T15:50:40	tomiahonen kirkburgess roivod cool. Looking forward to it. :) The industry has both my bull and bear case on smartwatch market.
BenBajarin	692011412739084288	2016-01-26T15:49:12	tomiahonen kirkburgess roivod I’ll leave it at this as this whole thread is useless.. I’ll be man enough to admit if I’m wrong will you?
BenBajarin	692011207339806720	2016-01-26T15:48:23	tomiahonen kirkburgess roivod I appreciate your insecurity :)
BenBajarin	692011000451637248	2016-01-26T15:47:34	tomiahonen kirkburgess roivod considering you don’t read any of it I’ll let that pass.
BenBajarin	692010795543060480	2016-01-26T15:46:45	tomiahonen kirkburgess roivod as will I ;) I’ll be here as the world moves past mobile also as is happening right now.
BenBajarin	692010589267230720	2016-01-26T15:45:56	tomiahonen kirkburgess roivod the world meaning those you pick and choose to support your bias? Awesome analysis..
BenBajarin	692010302322274304	2016-01-26T15:44:47	tomiahonen kirkburgess roivod that’s actually not how I work but that’s ok. We focus on strategy not reports.
BenBajarin	692009810531725312	2016-01-26T15:42:50	tomiahonen kirkburgess roivod this is shockingly bad analysis Tomi..
BenBajarin	692009191959973888	2016-01-26T15:40:22	tomiahonen kirkburgess roivod our research on over 1000 existing Apple Watch owners proves you wrong ;)
BenBajarin	692009068945215488	2016-01-26T15:39:53	Reading a financial report on display ads… I’m convinced millennials won’t give your ad .01 seconds unless it has moving pictures.

BenBajarin	692005567330562048	2016-01-26T15:25:58	tomiahonen kirkburgess roivod and to be clear there may be no smartwatch market but there will be an Apple Watch market.
BenBajarin	692004740662583296	2016-01-26T15:22:41	tomiahonen kirkburgess roivod like I said you are looking at it wrong. Check back in three years.

BenBajarin	691999214327320576	2016-01-26T15:00:44	How about pre-pay? That is the stat that matters now with EIP.  
BenBajarin	691992478539362304	2016-01-26T14:33:58	niubi correct. But I do think American companies competing in China is a key narrative given the importance of that market. So leanings..
BenBajarin	691992002276143104	2016-01-26T14:32:04	niubi more so because I’d like to see what happens. I don’t believe they can beat the locals but I’d love see the outcome.
BenBajarin	691991565393264640	2016-01-26T14:30:20	Chris_Ciaccia Yes I’m sure that is true. My data would over index on locals but again is a generic VPN point.
BenBajarin	691989820214632449	2016-01-26T14:23:24	Chris_Ciaccia I have a generic use VPN estimate but can’t tie to FB users directly quantitatively.
BenBajarin	691988284898017280	2016-01-26T14:17:18	tomiahonen kirkburgess roivod Ultimately I don’t believe you are thinking about this product correctly.
BenBajarin	691988164014006273	2016-01-26T14:16:49	tomiahonen kirkburgess roivod We do deep research on the wearable market. And historical fist gen device sales to boot prove you wrong.

BenBajarin	691801321251459072	2016-01-26T01:54:22	sposfanatic well I have scenarios ranging from 76-80bn.. I made several cases.. iPad was really bad and I do think AWatch helped..
BenBajarin	691799838770499586	2016-01-26T01:48:29	sposfanatic I don’t believe it had much impact Dec Q.
BenBajarin	691799044704899072	2016-01-26T01:45:19	We have quant research which proves this is true but still..   Notifications are the Apple Watches killer app.    
BenBajarin	691798576389824513	2016-01-26T01:43:28	sposfanatic Yeah, we actually have a bunch of quant data which brought us to that point even though intellectually we believed it. :)
BenBajarin	691798454985703424	2016-01-26T01:42:59	sposfanatic for which Q?
BenBajarin	691796769949257729	2016-01-26T01:36:17	sposfanatic yes certainly a factor.
BenBajarin	691793784657559552	2016-01-26T01:24:25	sposfanatic I’m doing my assessment by region. I know which regions are down and by how much and none trending more than single digits…
BenBajarin	691792285621719040	2016-01-26T01:18:28	sposfanatic I agree. 52 is a real hard case to make IMO. 56-58 likely. Maybe even 59..

BenBajarin	691478654212177921	2016-01-25T04:32:12	stroughtonsmith zcichy quite true. However largest sales of screen sizes 5.5 and greater are to low-income counties.Not Apple’s sweet spot
BenBajarin	691461992230465536	2016-01-25T03:26:00	And they are becoming a wearable tech company.

BenBajarin	690635855602458624	2016-01-22T20:43:14	carlos78oli good feedback. Curious then, what would you have liked to see them do that would cause you to upgrade?
BenBajarin	690635372267601920	2016-01-22T20:41:18	Agree.   
BenBajarin	690632210227994625	2016-01-22T20:28:44	I like this approach more than a “new new” 4 inch. 5s base being stubborn to upgrade. Maybe this helps.

BenBajarin	690332441026818048	2016-01-22T00:37:34	jyarow no way that is per year. Perhaps total.
BenBajarin	690307420313137152	2016-01-21T22:58:08	rkrishnakumar It’s tough. We see a lot of interest there but it doesn’t translate into sales. So need to work that out.

BenBajarin	689991360959660033	2016-01-21T02:02:14	mikesander2 QuincyMercel true. ;)
BenBajarin	689986926909198336	2016-01-21T01:44:37	QuincyMercel yep 24-25m for the Q is likely.
BenBajarin	689964133534580736	2016-01-21T00:14:03	I’ve learned quite a bit of interesting stuff running a subscription website for over three years now. Would be good to share them.

BenBajarin	689928822364340224	2016-01-20T21:53:44	yolegi worth a lot more than $100 as well ;)
BenBajarin	689928767616057344	2016-01-20T21:53:31	yolegi pretty valuable primary research in there. Worth a lot more than .50c ;)
BenBajarin	689913897688498176	2016-01-20T20:54:25	AAPLTree so my logic is sound ;). Tough to factor in a lower ASP but higher GM. Perhaps all balances out.

BenBajarin	688044906116296704	2016-01-15T17:07:43	MarkDMill I do have a sense they and Xiaomi could shake up the China PC OEM market.
BenBajarin	688044219655565312	2016-01-15T17:04:59	MarkDMill Understand. Windows is mature there Lenovo 40% share. That is what I think they are targeting. Emerging mkts another question.
BenBajarin	688042114316414976	2016-01-15T16:56:37	MarkDMill how big do you think that is there? Android certainly more mature I’d think..
BenBajarin	688040028744888321	2016-01-15T16:48:20	My guess is it is Windows based due to high installed base of Windows PCs in China. Then Android one for emerging..  
BenBajarin	688034116751605760	2016-01-15T16:24:51	mims fmanjoo never going to be able to un-see that ;)
BenBajarin	688032557540208641	2016-01-15T16:18:39	manumosu Apple is one of those companies you have to play investor sentiment as much as you do the company fundamentals. Sometimes more..
BenBajarin	688031995356565505	2016-01-15T16:16:25	zzbar but this is why I know there are more iPhones in use in China than many realize. Still healthy grey market. So its relevant in total
BenBajarin	688031880969633792	2016-01-15T16:15:58	zzbar Yeah. I break it out for investors. But knowing grey market is important to understand the upside in installed base and converts.
BenBajarin	688031466417188864	2016-01-15T16:14:19	zzbar I have both sets of numbers Apple’s reported and what I see sold through all channels including secondary.
BenBajarin	688031188922007558	2016-01-15T16:13:13	zzbar if I extract grey market it is 98%. Before Apple announced that I was at 102% so my estimate was pretty close.
BenBajarin	688030613698285569	2016-01-15T16:10:55	zzbar I track grey market also, so grey market was down. I do so, so I know actual share for installed base.
BenBajarin	688029411015299072	2016-01-15T16:06:09	manumosu your asking about total Q4 or just China? I’m talking about China but I’m not negative total YoY either.
BenBajarin	688026591969062912	2016-01-15T15:54:57	paarikan iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
BenBajarin	688026112279076864	2016-01-15T15:53:02	chrisdomico Yep. So either they are services companies, or services companies get into hardware, etc. Dynamics change.
BenBajarin	688025328820838401	2016-01-15T15:49:55	Real question is who besides Apple is going to make sustainable money from smartphone hardware?  
BenBajarin	688025106623369216	2016-01-15T15:49:02	This is a fun story to tell. Apple’s YoY iPhone sales growth in China from my model.   What I see in 2016 is key. 
BenBajarin	688023325021437957	2016-01-15T15:41:58	Please take our first global wristware survey 
BenBajarin	688023209665507328	2016-01-15T15:41:30	Exactly. The street does not love hardware companies. I still believe their template for Apple is flawed.  
BenBajarin	688023043235549185	2016-01-15T15:40:51	neilcybart pretty sure they still feel this way. :)

BenBajarin	688020272591564800	2016-01-15T15:29:50	neilcybart obviously for Xiaomi growth is growth, but you can see the slowdown happen clearly once the 6 and 6 Plus came out.

BenBajarin	687868417596985344	2016-01-15T05:26:25	I’m comfortable with the 22-24m range.  Possible for China to beat US in Q4 for first time.

BenBajarin	687705366528831488	2016-01-14T18:38:30	I want to be optimistic about this but I’m not.   
BenBajarin	687664963868037120	2016-01-14T15:57:58	dsilverman Cause they can and they believe they can take share and grow TAM in emerging markets.

BenBajarin	687660463551721472	2016-01-14T15:40:05	natisho DanielEran Totally. I’m fond of saying there is no gossip better than semiconductor industry gossip. ;)
BenBajarin	687659488564744198	2016-01-14T15:36:12	natisho DanielEran It is all inter-related. TSMC prioritizing Apple on new 16nm and not Qualcomm.

BenBajarin	687643501375311872	2016-01-14T14:32:41	Also this suggests a higher mix of TSMC vs. Samsung weaker than expected semiconductor revs.

BenBajarin	687475078724845568	2016-01-14T03:23:26	zzbar AAPLTree I don’t know yet. But the big estimate cuts for March are not grounded in reality. New things happening in supply chain.
BenBajarin	687474260856573952	2016-01-14T03:20:11	zzbar AAPLTree I think you will find Apple will be quite good meeting their own guidance going forward ;).
BenBajarin	687469929520467968	2016-01-14T03:02:58	reverse_swing3 it’s not bad. Just not as sophisticated.
BenBajarin	687469509465083905	2016-01-14T03:01:18	BongBong at least in the west, can’t discount brand. Brand is very important in consumer electronics.
BenBajarin	687469024830078976	2016-01-14T02:59:22	reverse_swing3 no those are not on the program.
BenBajarin	687468932475686912	2016-01-14T02:59:00	AAPLTree just for Dec Q last year.
BenBajarin	687468318979039232	2016-01-14T02:56:34	AAPLTree closer to 2%. Several things I can’t see which could make it 4% but hard to see much higher.
BenBajarin	687467005138477056	2016-01-14T02:51:21	RealMrPippy ah. Ok. I missed episode 1.
BenBajarin	687466246363721728	2016-01-14T02:48:20	RealMrPippy just tweeted I couldn’t tell and may be Garmin. Hard to see with no close ups.
BenBajarin	687466094576046082	2016-01-14T02:47:44	AAPLTree no. Just wasn’t massively up. I still think up sequentially but higher mix of 6/6 Plus vs. new than prior year mixes.
BenBajarin	687465861003608064	2016-01-14T02:46:48	May have spoken too soon. Biggest Loser may be using a Garmin not Apple Watch. If someone confirms let me know.
BenBajarin	687464002218110976	2016-01-14T02:39:25	billg thought Fitbit had a stint also. No?
BenBajarin	687463411177795584	2016-01-14T02:37:04	MichaelFShipe mix shift yes. Not sure on iPhone yet as I don’t like the idea… Yet..
BenBajarin	687463273789169664	2016-01-14T02:36:31	zzbar Chris_Ciaccia no.
BenBajarin	687462727367790592	2016-01-14T02:34:21	zzbar Chris_Ciaccia ASP won’t rise if mix of old is much higher. GM goes up though so could balance.
BenBajarin	687462550812758016	2016-01-14T02:33:39	I suppose seeing Apple Watch on the biggest loser was predictable given I saw Bob Harper at the March event. 
BenBajarin	687460476557496320	2016-01-14T02:25:24	Apple Watch being featured on the biggest loser as they were given to each contestant.   Powerful marketing.
BenBajarin	687460084654329856	2016-01-14T02:23:51	Chris_Ciaccia would have to be privately.
BenBajarin	687459901807788032	2016-01-14T02:23:07	chrisdomico lucaslints directly, I believe mix of older phones is higher than they model. And supply chain orders were well in advance..
BenBajarin	687459612564439040	2016-01-14T02:21:58	Chris_Ciaccia yes and more the 6/6 Plus than 5s. Very different mix this cycle than how most model. Also I have a good explanation for cuts
BenBajarin	687458999617236993	2016-01-14T02:19:32	Always risky to go against the flow, but I have a suspicion the Wall St. narrative on iPhone shipments will be wrong.
BenBajarin	687442032067870720	2016-01-14T01:12:07	PatrickMoorhead Well MS wants more first party consumer hardware. Tie it to PC closely and streamline user experience for editing video.
BenBajarin	687415052161409025	2016-01-13T23:24:54	asymco BenedictEvans if active, if have kids, or dog, etc and want to capture activity in way phone can’t then..
BenBajarin	687414933630353409	2016-01-13T23:24:26	asymco BenedictEvans The upside is less about extreme sports and more about active capture. Again no idea how big.
BenBajarin	687407135848792065	2016-01-13T22:53:27	jandawson neilcybart sure but it is the one I like best because of reasons why I think its a good entry level. Stupid easy to use.
BenBajarin	687406877395795969	2016-01-13T22:52:25	This may be true, but I do enjoy the contrarian arguments to be made and you can certainly make them.   
BenBajarin	687406685233770498	2016-01-13T22:51:39	gonglei89 dannyboy414 my conviction as well. They run risk of losing consumer entirely if they don’t.
BenBajarin	687406509203046400	2016-01-13T22:50:57	jandawson neilcybart I have them all and I love the Session. I think it’s their best one and my default.
BenBajarin	687405732656984064	2016-01-13T22:47:52	jmover exactly. Hence why I said Microsoft should buy them, tie it to PC and solve.. ;)
BenBajarin	687405647802044417	2016-01-13T22:47:32	I again reference this thing I wrote which is playing out for many companies.    When the easy growth is over.   
BenBajarin	687405298940784640	2016-01-13T22:46:09	We have some interesting stuff to talk about on the Tech.pinions podcast this week.
BenBajarin	687405083865264128	2016-01-13T22:45:18	I tend to agree.   
BenBajarin	687404982535077888	2016-01-13T22:44:53	jandawson neilcybart agree but this was a disrupt yourself or get disrupted situation. Their brand owns the segment.
BenBajarin	687404784983371778	2016-01-13T22:44:06	neilcybart even with my iPhone I still use mine to capture tons of great content of my kids.
BenBajarin	687404389536018437	2016-01-13T22:42:32	neilcybart But I had a sense they would be an acquisition target for a long time, this makes it easier. Brand has value.
BenBajarin	687404295386431488	2016-01-13T22:42:10	neilcybart Maybe. More interestingly I think is the discussion if they should have even been a public company.
BenBajarin	687403883543543809	2016-01-13T22:40:31	neilcybart if they would have launched the Session at $199 or lower it would have brought many new folks into the market.
BenBajarin	687403701665951745	2016-01-13T22:39:48	neilcybart that was/is well understood. Their installed base is really not bad. Just not as large as they thought.
BenBajarin	687403201348399106	2016-01-13T22:37:49	neilcybart yes to why it’s hard to expand TAM, not that the few who are are not strapping their iPhone to their surfboard.
BenBajarin	687402919428255745	2016-01-13T22:36:41	tballard87 tight integration with PC/Windows. Streamline software, make it easer to sort, manage, create vids, etc.
BenBajarin	687402812267978753	2016-01-13T22:36:16	neilcybart It isn’t being cannibalized. Their sales issues aren’t from low-end competitors. Not yet at least..
BenBajarin	687401964544626688	2016-01-13T22:32:54	Another issue with GoPro was managing all that video. Need a better way to make quick vids from 30 mins of mostly useless video.
BenBajarin	687401424037216257	2016-01-13T22:30:45	Krewell well that wasn’t for the hardware no matter what anyone says..
BenBajarin	687401250871205893	2016-01-13T22:30:04	craigcramer maybe. We still see high loyalty. Perhaps forget or managing video too much but not switching to something else.
BenBajarin	687401091282108420	2016-01-13T22:29:26	Krewell no need.
BenBajarin	687400403600805888	2016-01-13T22:26:42	Drones are not GoPro’s answer to their problems. They need a product to get more people to buy their first action cam. Expand TAM.
BenBajarin	687399270517968896	2016-01-13T22:22:12	I wrote up GoPro’s decent history – and worrying signs for the future – here a month ago:  Today, bad Q4 results…
BenBajarin	687399121179783168	2016-01-13T22:21:36	kirkburgess neilcybart yes but their TAM is not yet reached. Lots of growth in wearables still ahead.
BenBajarin	687398964673511437	2016-01-13T22:20:59	miriamgottfried mims just can’t forget brand matters in consumer electronics. Market just not large is what we are learning.
BenBajarin	687398521406918658	2016-01-13T22:19:13	neilcybart still are, very loyal base, just doesn’t appear to be big. Their brand dominates the segment.
BenBajarin	687398273116704768	2016-01-13T22:18:14	miriamgottfried mims we see a pretty loyal base from the market in its current manifestation. Just not large market thus far.
BenBajarin	687398126995566593	2016-01-13T22:17:39	cliftonmthomas 1. They want more first party consumer hardware. 2. Lock it to increase PC value.
BenBajarin	687397956102844416	2016-01-13T22:16:58	BRoodman lock to PC experiences.
BenBajarin	687397823336345601	2016-01-13T22:16:26	mims miriamgottfried won’t matter here. China fine but GoPro not big there either. High brand loyalty for GoPro thus far.
BenBajarin	687397704209666048	2016-01-13T22:15:58	If I was Microsoft I’d buy GoPro.
BenBajarin	687397564933603330	2016-01-13T22:15:25	miriamgottfried mims certainly not a fad, just a niche. This category doesn’t go away it’s just not large. Maxed their TAM and not growing
BenBajarin	687397339401695233	2016-01-13T22:14:31	GoPro simply maxed their user base, peaking essentially. No reason for base to buy new ones and no product to expand their TAM.
BenBajarin	687394138849820672	2016-01-13T22:01:48	Not looking good.    
BenBajarin	687357038553214976	2016-01-13T19:34:23	samirb kcfaul he is telling me we may be in the 60’s where the Japanese first started emphasizing quality.. Thoughts?
BenBajarin	687348493757763584	2016-01-13T19:00:25	samirb kcfaul You think 30 more than 20? Luckily I’m related to an industry historian to help with the history ;)

BenBajarin	687342823805341696	2016-01-13T18:37:54	rkrishnakumar jyarow That is my real concern…. I think Jed’s love affair with Baalke is a real problem.
BenBajarin	687342041601200129	2016-01-13T18:34:47	jyarow I’m more interested in why not the Niners.
BenBajarin	687341246956744705	2016-01-13T18:31:38	kcfaul samirb Yep. I have a half written post on why Chinese of today are like where Japanese brands were 20 years ago.
BenBajarin	687338776419418112	2016-01-13T18:21:49	asymco I’ve got it about ~1.1 billion in 2015.

BenBajarin	687087113850892288	2016-01-13T01:41:48	When you understand the job Chinese consumers hire the iPhone to do you realize Apple’s TAM is no where near reached in China.
BenBajarin	687086611654311936	2016-01-13T01:39:48	I ask about actual ownership. Greater China just over 20% said they own an iPhone in our surveys.   
BenBajarin	687041873580441600	2016-01-12T22:42:01	Consumers came later to PCs, and move away from them for mobile earlier.

BenBajarin	686941426240753664	2016-01-12T16:02:53	sameer_singh17 I know those guys so I get it. But it explains why I’m getting more custom research budgets from the bigger firms.
BenBajarin	686940929656111105	2016-01-12T16:00:55	Ha! They shipped nearly this many before Q4. Also flawed research.  
BenBajarin	686940677838483457	2016-01-12T15:59:54	sameer_singh17 confirmation bias? ;) Luckily I trust my data much more than Jupiter.. Fascinating how different it can be.

BenBajarin	686914014064979969	2016-01-12T14:13:57	tierrapartners agree with that. Touch ID as example. More of that coming I’m sure but the excitement is gone. Necessary yes. Exciting no.

BenBajarin	686910409484312576	2016-01-12T13:59:38	tierrapartners none of that exciting. That’s the point of my article. More coming in mobile but beyond hardware is where to focus.

BenBajarin	686652943018266624	2016-01-11T20:56:33	jameswester I’m interested if Android and Chrome integrate and more form factors are supported. But not a big market for Google.
BenBajarin	686647465068498944	2016-01-11T20:34:47	jameswester our iPad school user Google docs also that not unique to Chromebooks. But much better ecosystem in total for education.
BenBajarin	686647185509761025	2016-01-11T20:33:40	jameswester this is where Android on 2-1 could be good in schools also. But small market for Google.
BenBajarin	686647039497617408	2016-01-11T20:33:06	jameswester agree on cost obviously. But much better use of tool for future workflows seeing with iPad in education.
BenBajarin	686645526041739264	2016-01-11T20:27:05	jameswester wrong platform for the future.  I see the difference first hand with each child using one or the other.

BenBajarin	686612977705857024	2016-01-11T18:17:45	brianshall what matters is what springs up from it. That is my main point and the important takeaway.
BenBajarin	686612816963346432	2016-01-11T18:17:06	brianshall point was hardware is fine. Next two billion is my FinTech point. Hardware not the point anymore it’s settled.
BenBajarin	686611663286476800	2016-01-11T18:12:31	brianshall that not exciting. Interesting but not exciting. Also not sure you actually read the whole thing since I point that out.
BenBajarin	686611111345389568	2016-01-11T18:10:20	brianshall ha. You are more confused than I thought if you think the hardware is where we should focus ;)

BenBajarin	686581250631454720	2016-01-11T16:11:40	Probably my favorite quote from my article.   
BenBajarin	686577211395080192	2016-01-11T15:55:37	mims What we need is more cohort trend data. Specially with the next generation and car ownership/intent. Millennials may view differently.
BenBajarin	686570198485184513	2016-01-11T15:27:45	abdophoto Yep. Yet their are going to have good earnings.. Reading their investors is the key part of this.
BenBajarin	686569563333365762	2016-01-11T15:25:14	Fitbit, similar to Apple, is the kind of stock you need to know when to play investor sentiment not just the company

BenBajarin	685277819790704641	2016-01-08T01:52:18	There are maybe 200 around me at airport in Las Vegas. Maybe 10% on a PC. Everyone else glaring into their smartphone. Tells it all.

BenBajarin	685200261409669120	2016-01-07T20:44:07	My techpinions column today – finally wrote up my thoughts on why Apple should buy Netflix: 
BenBajarin	685210126400249856	2016-01-07T21:23:19	Kind of hard to see from a pic but this is the Thinkpad Yoga X1 work OLED display. All PC displays need this. 
BenBajarin	685196393833754625	2016-01-07T20:28:45	BenDiFrancesco assuming that person wants or needs more machine at some point. Android makes more sense than Windows for them.
BenBajarin	685196267908165632	2016-01-07T20:28:15	BenDiFrancesco their thesis is the one I have written about. Those who onboard to computers with Android won’t want Windows on a PC.
BenBajarin	685194150313127936	2016-01-07T20:19:50	Some will argue this takes the fun out of fishing. I want to try it anyway.   Smart fish finder.

BenBajarin	685186638281084930	2016-01-07T19:49:59	Finally got to try the Remix OS from Jyde. Optimized version of Android for full size PCs. Surprisingly good.

BenBajarin	685170114669469696	2016-01-07T18:44:19	A lot of security and privacy solutions like these in the startup area at CES. Some hardware some software some both 
BenBajarin	685166348473884672	2016-01-07T18:29:21	I think we are on our third iteration of the smart fork now. 
BenBajarin	685165617008275456	2016-01-07T18:26:27	Interesting. This case let’s you change and upgrade your phones hardware features with this modular approach.

BenBajarin	685147530800295937	2016-01-07T17:14:35	neilcybart same with 5s though. I asked 5s owners in a panel intent to upgrade and a lot said they see no need.
BenBajarin	685147246858481664	2016-01-07T17:13:27	greengart yep. Did you do the Mars one? That was mind blowing and a huge indicator of mixed reality potential.
BenBajarin	685146460464230400	2016-01-07T17:10:20	greengart you need to get the Hololens demo.
BenBajarin	685146346693783552	2016-01-07T17:09:53	Why I have been saying it is inevitable the VR and AR worlds merge. Both Magic Leap and Hololens have right idea. 
BenBajarin	685128232161644545	2016-01-07T15:57:54	pavanrajam yep. However, this is quite telling about usage of this use case. Meaning not good for PCs.

BenBajarin	685127597362130945	2016-01-07T15:55:22	Hmmm.   
BenBajarin	685126286902177793	2016-01-07T15:50:10	kiggle my take would be Apple can do something exclusive and proprietary but others can not. Witricity will win Windows ecosystems.
BenBajarin	685125879975010305	2016-01-07T15:48:33	ZhugeEX well they can wirelessly charge electric cars so…

BenBajarin	684755553135030272	2016-01-06T15:17:00	ksmith8877 benpickering yes. And potentially an Apple not beats wireless option.
BenBajarin	684752830029156353	2016-01-06T15:06:11	You have to understand what is happening with headphone trends to understand this.

BenBajarin	684423774075092992	2016-01-05T17:18:38	sameer_singh17 Hence why there is good reason to be bullish with the dedicated products like Charge HR. Poorly positioned for smartwatch.
BenBajarin	684423357085794304	2016-01-05T17:16:58	sameer_singh17 plus you know why the early parts of a market favor integrated players. Just a state of the adoption cycle of today.
BenBajarin	684423173719232513	2016-01-05T17:16:15	sameer_singh17 I hear the iPod referenced a lot by investors. Belief in category just not belief in competition in it. Yet…
BenBajarin	684422773045772288	2016-01-05T17:14:39	GarettSloane it’s neutral. VR/AR tech has a way to go before normals get it in their hands.
BenBajarin	684422545676697600	2016-01-05T17:13:45	sameer_singh17 whole lot more than that going on. Less about the category more about Fitbit’s ability to compete in it.

BenBajarin	684055550963789824	2016-01-04T16:55:27	gonglei89 sameer_singh17 my point is, based on process, there is bad data and there is good data. Most people very bad at it.
BenBajarin	684055390787514368	2016-01-04T16:54:48	AquaSimplex The value to Google is in data collection not money from apps. What they do with that is a different story.
BenBajarin	684055299389407232	2016-01-04T16:54:27	AquaSimplex most apps on Android are free. Very few people paying money on that platform. Study economics of Android.
BenBajarin	684054623116591104	2016-01-04T16:51:45	Apple as well. With AI, and many other things, innovation may no longer happen in parallel.

BenBajarin	684052244270952448	2016-01-04T16:42:18	All depends on how good at it you are and how much consumer ethnography goes into it…

BenBajarin	684052061613260805	2016-01-04T16:41:35	AquaSimplex the economic opportunities are not that simple. Lots of value created on top of.. not from Google.
BenBajarin	684048307484635137	2016-01-04T16:26:40	sameer_singh17 Given my data I’m still more bullish on FB than Google.
BenBajarin	684048093298348032	2016-01-04T16:25:49	sameer_singh17 likely not winner take all here anyway. That’s the big difference of Google rise vs the market today.  Why it’s no slam dunk
BenBajarin	684047664766259200	2016-01-04T16:24:06	sameer_singh17 sure but default win here is not Google. They have a chance but nothing is settled. More competition here than page rank.
BenBajarin	684047247839920129	2016-01-04T16:22:27	sameer_singh17 mvakulenko from what I hear about what is happening internally with Android.. More bullish on FB…
BenBajarin	684047134899896320	2016-01-04T16:22:00	sameer_singh17 Their ad business has likely peaked though. Don’t overlook that. Most profitable 2billion now online… Must go beyond ads.

BenBajarin	684046811691003904	2016-01-04T16:20:43	sameer_singh17 mvakulenko I have quite a bit of primary research on this very point. More discovery pointing to FB not Google.
BenBajarin	684046593570377728	2016-01-04T16:19:51	AquaSimplex every bit of my research points to FB as the more important platform over Google in mobile.

BenBajarin	684046029172248576	2016-01-04T16:17:36	sameer_singh17 mvakulenko all well understood. I’m thinking much more big picture than most are.
BenBajarin	684045879657955328	2016-01-04T16:17:01	sameer_singh17 in essence Android is just a dumb pipe.
BenBajarin	684045809680175104	2016-01-04T16:16:44	sameer_singh17 but gets no intrinsic value. Hence the Android conundrum for Google. Control distribution fine but not customer value.

BenBajarin	684045010937884672	2016-01-04T16:13:34	sameer_singh17 not talking about apps.  Look beyond apps.

BenBajarin	684044470489190400	2016-01-04T16:11:25	sameer_singh17 More importantly, FB is the more powerful lock in than Google in most markets..
BenBajarin	684044167090049024	2016-01-04T16:10:13	sameer_singh17 Will not be surprised to see Google make structural changes to allow more diversity vs. more control.
BenBajarin	684044042162667521	2016-01-04T16:09:43	sameer_singh17 Some things have changed. Google stronghold not what it was and their rub against competitors hurst them.
