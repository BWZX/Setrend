mrianleslie	684853623738765312	2016-01-06T21:46:42	Excellent piece 
mrianleslie	684851681855717376	2016-01-06T21:38:59	I am aware that frogs don't actually stay in hot water if they can help it. Unless they've had their brain removed. 
mrianleslie	684851288731967494	2016-01-06T21:37:25	Labour's centrists are suffering from boiled frog syndrome. It's later than they think.
mrianleslie	684850902600146945	2016-01-06T21:35:53	Labour MPs should act on this (beautifully written) advice from Joe Haines, &amp; stop waiting for something to turn up. 
mrianleslie	684849193224159232	2016-01-06T21:29:06	AndrewCooper__ I'd go further and they say they've already got him - this is simply stage 2 of a strategic PR narrative.
mrianleslie	684846778278129668	2016-01-06T21:19:30	heretic027 Yes, and oddly enough the text I posted bears that out.

mrianleslie	684741039521923072	2016-01-06T14:19:20	Yes. Plenty of moderate voters, and a fringe of moderate party actors, but the party is conservative.

mrianleslie	684680164891045892	2016-01-06T10:17:26	Precisely

mrianleslie	684678637128421377	2016-01-06T10:11:22	dixewills Have to accept most voters don't think Corbs/McD can run the country. Blame the media if you like, but that's where we are.
mrianleslie	684678336006717440	2016-01-06T10:10:10	dixewills I mean it's amazing the Morning Star doesn't have a bigger circulation, you'd have thought a massive gap in the market?!
mrianleslie	684676557902868481	2016-01-06T10:03:06	dixewills "spun against McDonnell" - what are you talking about? Showing the clip on the news is spinning?
mrianleslie	684673145849122817	2016-01-06T09:49:33	dixewills Number one is don't give them easy wins. McDonnell does that every week. He is a clown.
mrianleslie	684672732349509632	2016-01-06T09:47:54	dixewills But that is besides point. Let's accept your premise: media overwhelmingly biased against Labour. What should Lab do about it?
mrianleslie	684672463930814464	2016-01-06T09:46:50	dixewills Unless you're stretching the definition of Tory media to include the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, and many online sources.
mrianleslie	684672353104703488	2016-01-06T09:46:24	dixewills I don't think media is overwhelmingly Tory. You're talking about 2 or 3 newspapers &amp; most people don't get news from newspapers.

mrianleslie	684660427201089536	2016-01-06T08:59:00	I agree with what he said but it’s plainly disingenuous of McFadden to pretend that question on terrorism wasn’t a jab at Corbyn.
