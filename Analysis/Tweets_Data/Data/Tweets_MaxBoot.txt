MaxBoot	708133486008385538	2016-03-11T03:32:34	"Let's make a deal" is a game show--not a foreign policy.
MaxBoot	708133358061096961	2016-03-11T03:32:03	Trump is neutral not only on Israel but also on Tiananmen Square massacre.

MaxBoot	708132600880238592	2016-03-11T03:29:03	According to everyone who knows him, he has never read a book. This is not a joke.

MaxBoot	708132416326672385	2016-03-11T03:28:19	Kasich gives right reaction on massacre at Tiananmen  Square: he condemns it, rather than praising the killers for being "strong."
MaxBoot	708132007168090113	2016-03-11T03:26:41	Trump hears his quote praising Tiananmen Square butchers &amp; Putin and then denies that he praised them.  "Strong doesn't mean good." Huh?
MaxBoot	708131710668505089	2016-03-11T03:25:30	Trump has no core beliefs and a desire to make deals. He will get taken to cleaners by his good friend Vladimir Putin.

MaxBoot	708130565267001344	2016-03-11T03:20:57	I'd say being semi-coherent is a requirement and Trump isn't.  
MaxBoot	708130286379393024	2016-03-11T03:19:51	Consequences of Trump's economic and foreign policies would be catastrophic: 
MaxBoot	708130024516403200	2016-03-11T03:18:48	Other candidates need to call out Trump for his defense of Putin, butchers of Tiananmen Square, even Kim Jong-un.
MaxBoot	708129705669562369	2016-03-11T03:17:32	Trump thinks everything is a deal. But we need a president who stands for principles and doesn't make concessions to enemies to seal a deal.
MaxBoot	708129327016235008	2016-03-11T03:16:02	Possible Trump view: The world is a real estate market. All is negotiable: Ukraine, Baltics, Taiwan, Israel, etc 
MaxBoot	708129177157947392	2016-03-11T03:15:26	Trump is lowering his voice, trying to be more restrained and presidential. He's a chameleon.
MaxBoot	708128737028661249	2016-03-11T03:13:41	He doesn't know what a consulate or an embassy is.  
MaxBoot	708128521982517248	2016-03-11T03:12:50	Rubio schools Trump on Cuba policy. Trump has no idea that US embassy is same building as US consulate.
MaxBoot	708128342143344640	2016-03-11T03:12:07	Because Trump knows nothing about foreign policy he keeps saying over and over agin that he will make "good deals." He's content free.
MaxBoot	708127846846341120	2016-03-11T03:10:09	Where is Trump's position paper to explain his new ISIS policy? Oh right, to have that he would need a foreign policy team.
MaxBoot	708127565530185729	2016-03-11T03:09:02	Trump again proving that policy is utterly irrelevant to his campaign. It's a cult of personality. His supporters have no idea what he'd do.
MaxBoot	708127064398946305	2016-03-11T03:07:03	Is Trump interventionist or isolationist? He changes positions so fast it's impossible to keep up.
MaxBoot	708126683644227585	2016-03-11T03:05:32	Trump suddenly endorses 20,000-30,000 US troops to fight ISIS after saying for last year that air strikes and "take the oil" enough.
MaxBoot	708126302637838337	2016-03-11T03:04:01	Cruz is right that rules of engagement too strict in Iraq but he's exaggerating when he says troops can't defend themselves.

MaxBoot	708125521796866048	2016-03-11T03:00:55	Trump seems to think negotiating peace for Israel is like negotiating a deal for a new golf course.
MaxBoot	708125170813247488	2016-03-11T02:59:31	Cruz needs to temper his enthusiasm for President Sisi of Egyot who is locking up liberals along with Islamists.
MaxBoot	708124996057571335	2016-03-11T02:58:50	Actually, realDonaldTrump, everyone on the stage is more pro-Israel than you.
MaxBoot	708124814205124609	2016-03-11T02:58:06	Trump says he is both pro-Israel and neutral on Israel. Incoherent as usual. In same sentence.
MaxBoot	708124655362695168	2016-03-11T02:57:28	"There's no one on this stage who is more pro-Israel than me" says the man who wants to be "neutral" between Israel and its enemies.
MaxBoot	708123806058090502	2016-03-11T02:54:06	I think we've finally figured out who's advising Trump on foreign policy. Jack Bauer.
MaxBoot	708124285462831104	2016-03-11T02:56:00	Cruz points out that Trump won't end Iranian nuclear deal and wants to be neutral between Israel and its enemies. Strong points.
MaxBoot	708124135227068416	2016-03-11T02:55:24	Trump flip flops again on war crimes. He disowned them after last debate but now embraces killing innocent relatives of terrorists.
MaxBoot	708123807991603200	2016-03-11T02:54:06	Shorter Trump: terrorists are laughing at us so we have to be just like the terrorists.
MaxBoot	708123771157286912	2016-03-11T02:53:58	Trump goes back to his war crimes platform. He wants America to emulate ISIS. Says we need to "expand law" to kill terrorists' relatives.
MaxBoot	708123379715411969	2016-03-11T02:52:24	Both Rubio and Kasich point out most Muslims are moderate and we need to work with them.  Trump doesn't get it.

MaxBoot	708122898540699648	2016-03-11T02:50:29	Trump has no idea that vast majority Muslims are moderate and oppose extremists. Rubio points out we need to work with them.
MaxBoot	708122403658993664	2016-03-11T02:48:31	Wonderful Rubio defense of patriotic Muslims. Great rejoinder to Trump's hate-mongering.
MaxBoot	708122200658673664	2016-03-11T02:47:43	Rubio introduces the notion that when presidents talk there are consequences. Novel.
MaxBoot	708122174163439616	2016-03-11T02:47:37	Trump doesn't seem to realize that by depicting Islam as anti-American he is empowering terrorists and hurting our security.

MaxBoot	708120916144877568	2016-03-11T02:42:37	Trump says US companies shouldn't manufacture in China. Do as he says, not as he does.
MaxBoot	708120523163701248	2016-03-11T02:41:03	Cruz is right: Americans pay tariffs. A tariff hike=a tax hike.
MaxBoot	708120319958130688	2016-03-11T02:40:15	Trump complains that China is selling Americans too many goods they want to buy at a good price. The scandal!
