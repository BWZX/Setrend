Richard_Florida	721701622146011136	2016-04-17T14:07:29	8. The whole discourse around neoliberalism is less a solution &amp; much more a reflection of the problem we face.
Richard_Florida	721701266343272450	2016-04-17T14:06:05	7. If Sanders would win and made to govern in the US today, he too would be immediately pinned as a neoliberal.
Richard_Florida	721700983445786625	2016-04-17T14:04:57	6. Might history have turned out differently say is Gore had won not George W. Bush ... Those differences MATTER.
Richard_Florida	721700758253629441	2016-04-17T14:04:03	5. Obama once seen as a progressive force is now pilloried as neoliberal. Is there really no difference between Obama and McCain-Palin.
Richard_Florida	721700267004207105	2016-04-17T14:02:06	4. But there are HUGE differences between them - differences which really matter to nations, cities, &amp; peoples' lives.
Richard_Florida	721700068156436481	2016-04-17T14:01:19	3. Under its fuzzy definition all US Presidential candidates, Trump, Cruz, Kasich, Clinton, &amp; Sanders could be characterized as neoliberal.
Richard_Florida	721699640031232000	2016-04-17T13:59:37	2.  Milton Friedman, Reagan, Thatcher, Obama, I could go on are very different and those differences matter.
Richard_Florida	721699440206200832	2016-04-17T13:58:49	1. I don't buy this one bit. Neo-liberalism is the kind of catch-all category the lazy thinkers  love.

Richard_Florida	717748661321502721	2016-04-06T16:19:50	11. The future is not mere clustered urban innovation, but cities &amp; urbanity as THE platform for innovation.
Richard_Florida	717748530949980160	2016-04-06T16:19:19	11.  Toronto has particular edge at intersection of startups, real estate &amp; urban dev. Real estate community is among world's most powerful.
Richard_Florida	717748277261643776	2016-04-06T16:18:19	10. Toronto's strengths should be in startups linked to finance, media, entertainment &amp; creative industries &amp; in particular real estate.

Richard_Florida	717745684623937536	2016-04-06T16:08:00	7.  Toronto's biggest asset in VC &amp; startup activity is its dense, vibrant urban structure that attracts &amp; amasses diverse talent.
Richard_Florida	717745171564081153	2016-04-06T16:05:58	5.  $250 million or 75.6% of Toronto area VC investment is located in the city. Compare to $57 million in Waterloo.
Richard_Florida	717744840029540352	2016-04-06T16:04:39	6. Other Toronto neighborhoods with VC investment include: Yonge &amp; Eglington, Hospital District, Liberty Vil Portlands, Financial District.
Richard_Florida	717744326365679617	2016-04-06T16:02:37	5. The Annex (near UofT) w/ $81 mil  &amp; The Fashion District w/ $74 mil account for half of all Toronto area VC investment.
Richard_Florida	717743812043407361	2016-04-06T16:00:34	4. Venture capital investment in Toronto is highly urban, concentrated in the core &amp; around UofT:

Richard_Florida	709183760001048576	2016-03-14T01:05:59	Tonight's Trump tweetstorm in one place (via DemFromCT): 
Richard_Florida	709181726405337088	2016-03-14T00:57:54	But no one should be comforted about the point we're at with Trump or what it has revealed about the health of our political system.
Richard_Florida	709179672177844224	2016-03-14T00:49:44	General elections can be won and lost on chance swings in the economy or foreign policy crises. There are no guarantees at that point.
Richard_Florida	709179486529572864	2016-03-14T00:49:00	A major party nomination is a powerful thing. Millions of people will instinctively support Trump. Many/most GOP pols will back him.
Richard_Florida	709179265485512704	2016-03-14T00:48:07	One reason: much of the "this will end soon..." rationalizing (which I once shared) has now shifted to general. No one should be comforted.
Richard_Florida	709178848705961985	2016-03-14T00:46:28	We're looking over the precipice and I mostly hear crickets. Trump could be on his way toward the GOP nomination after *Tuesday* night
Richard_Florida	709177611914764289	2016-03-14T00:41:33	I honestly thought our institutions were more robust to a Trump-like figure &amp; that others in public life were more committed to dem. norms
Richard_Florida	709176531533299712	2016-03-14T00:37:15	We can sort through root causes later. Here's where we are: Someone could capture a major party nom who endorses violence &amp; few seem alarmed
Richard_Florida	709174759989383168	2016-03-14T00:30:13	These norms are fragile precisely because, per emilythorson, they are not formal or legal. And they are hard to restore once breached.
Richard_Florida	709174488349478912	2016-03-14T00:29:08	Shockingly few public figures and elites are defending the norms of public debate and restraint from violence that Trump is bulldozing.
Richard_Florida	709174152582860802	2016-03-14T00:27:48	Trump's rise represents a failure in American parties, media, and civic institutions - and they're continuing to fail right now
Richard_Florida	709173808117190657	2016-03-14T00:26:26	That's why I'm dubious about all the root cause psychologizing - where's data showing economic anxiety or racial hatred is that much higher?
Richard_Florida	709173444596912129	2016-03-14T00:24:59	People's vulnerability to Trump-like figure hasn't changed. What changed is that the institutions of Am. govt./party system legitimized one
Richard_Florida	709173094506741760	2016-03-14T00:23:36	Sadly, we've known for decades that a subset of people have authoritarian tendencies and that hatred toward outgroups is often widespread

Richard_Florida	699608910420930560	2016-02-16T14:58:57	Some would say major investors in both parties have blocked this shift. In doing so, they have opened pandora's box. 
Richard_Florida	699608559487684609	2016-02-16T14:57:33	Go RutgersU !!! 
Richard_Florida	699607660400873472	2016-02-16T14:53:58	Femme_Mal I am a big fan of Tom Ferguson's investment theory of politics (he was my advisor in poli sci at MIT).
Richard_Florida	699607493652180992	2016-02-16T14:53:19	How can these ideological blocs be fashioned together into governing coalitions? 
Richard_Florida	699607350492135427	2016-02-16T14:52:45	Good point. Part of more far-reaching dealignment. Question: Do traditional parties "fit" w/ postindustrial order? 
Richard_Florida	699601059921006594	2016-02-16T14:27:45	Richard_Florida I think you're on to something, Richard. The transition from a proportional economy to a scaling one is shaking people up.
Richard_Florida	699606908311830528	2016-02-16T14:50:59	Yep. I'd say 1980 was the turning point I see in the data. 
Richard_Florida	699606660105572352	2016-02-16T14:50:00	Yep, that is where we are headed. and that is what is generating such anger &amp; anxiety. 
Richard_Florida	699606534972686336	2016-02-16T14:49:30	andredarmanin Thanks Andre.
Richard_Florida	699606453053693952	2016-02-16T14:49:11	Big smile. 
Richard_Florida	699606409080659970	2016-02-16T14:49:00	Indeed ... America has been very good at avoiding that through at least two similar transformations. 
Richard_Florida	699606096063938561	2016-02-16T14:47:46	My sense is the party structures block it ...  
Richard_Florida	699605536967417856	2016-02-16T14:45:32	Richard_Florida a vision that goes beyond casino capitalism.
Richard_Florida	699605124491145216	2016-02-16T14:43:54	24. And that developing economic &amp; social structure to harness the full creativity of each is the key to creating real meaning &amp; purpose.
Richard_Florida	699604933373509633	2016-02-16T14:43:08	23. To my mind, such a progressive agenda turns on the recognition that every single  human being is creative.
Richard_Florida	699604715810766848	2016-02-16T14:42:16	22. To get beyond Trumpism require  a vision of a post-industrial society which goes beyond just crass materialism.
Richard_Florida	699604364332265472	2016-02-16T14:40:53	21. That will require a progressive, inclusive vision of a post-industrial knowledge economy where everyone is included &amp; rewarded.
Richard_Florida	699604080960892929	2016-02-16T14:39:45	20. Now is the test of whether it can do so again ...
Richard_Florida	699604005920571392	2016-02-16T14:39:27	19. America has always led the world in finding ways to realign its political structures in ways that leverage big economic transformations.
Richard_Florida	699603798130614272	2016-02-16T14:38:38	18. Big takeaway is that the old political order is finally starting to break down under the weight of these economic transformations.
Richard_Florida	699603599899418625	2016-02-16T14:37:50	17. It would also seem to open a lane for Bloomberg as someone who has managed these transformations in NYC.
Richard_Florida	699603219694145540	2016-02-16T14:36:20	17.  This is why Trumpism is so different than Sanders. Trumpism is reactionism, while Sanders can help point the way to a better future.
Richard_Florida	699603035069222912	2016-02-16T14:35:36	16.  The far right has been better at mobilizing around fear than the progressive left has at creating an inclusive vision of the future.
Richard_Florida	699602790461657093	2016-02-16T14:34:37	15. This dealignment phase is volatile, unpredictable &amp; dangerous. Odd things (like the rise of Rob Ford) can happen.
Richard_Florida	699602671720906753	2016-02-16T14:34:09	14. We are going through the dealigment phase - the tearing down of old institutions - that occurs for any realignment.
Richard_Florida	699602417650962432	2016-02-16T14:33:09	13. In this sense it is not surprising that Rob Ford (the precursor to Trumpism) emerged in Toronto a model post-industrial city.
Richard_Florida	699602175819968512	2016-02-16T14:32:11	12. We are dealing with an enormous shift from an industrial order which created a largely white male working class to a new knowledge econ.
Richard_Florida	699602000812576769	2016-02-16T14:31:29	11. The depth of dissatisfaction &amp; the scope of the Great Political/Policy Reset is massive.
Richard_Florida	699601766900441089	2016-02-16T14:30:33	10. FDR, the New Deal &amp; the postwar Golden Age of the middle class occurred about a century or more after the rise of large scale industry.
Richard_Florida	699601618023669760	2016-02-16T14:29:58	9. But the lags are long, esp for the creation of new political institutions that can adjust to &amp; moderate fundamental economic change.
Richard_Florida	699601452143083520	2016-02-16T14:29:18	8. Looking back in time, we think the adjustments are quick &amp; automatic.
Richard_Florida	699601333901463552	2016-02-16T14:28:50	7. I have elsewhere written that Great Resets (like the one we are going through) are gradual evolutionary events.
Richard_Florida	699601179563659264	2016-02-16T14:28:13	6. Key quote: "The public has concluded that our 20th century institutions are incapable of dealing with 21st century challenges."
Richard_Florida	699601054246268932	2016-02-16T14:27:43	5. People/ voters have lost faith not only in politics but in governing institutions &amp; are looking for alternatives.
Richard_Florida	699600793754800128	2016-02-16T14:26:41	4.  This is ripping apart our class structure and social order in a variety of ways, underpinning rising inequality &amp; economic divides.
Richard_Florida	699600605837443073	2016-02-16T14:25:57	3. This is the decline of the industrial order &amp; the working class (&amp; related stable institutions) &amp; the rise of the new post-industrial one
Richard_Florida	699600439441027075	2016-02-16T14:25:17	2. The basic thesis is that the election is occurring at a time of epochal economic, demographic &amp; social change .
Richard_Florida	699600076390461444	2016-02-16T14:23:50	1. Very interesting take about what is happening in the US presidential election ( a little tweet storm to follow)

Richard_Florida	698954381044146180	2016-02-14T19:38:05	1. Several comments to my earlier tweetstorm abt capitalists using race/ religion etc to counter the bigger threat of mass mobilization.
Richard_Florida	698953657493168128	2016-02-14T19:35:12	Thanks for storifying me ... 
Richard_Florida	698953407894265856	2016-02-14T19:34:13	In other words, they have nothing to fear ... but themselves ... 
Richard_Florida	698910215736061953	2016-02-14T16:42:35	Richard_Florida So they aren't *most* threatening to capitalist. Capital prefers political dysfunction to mass worker mobilization.
Richard_Florida	698909741918060544	2016-02-14T16:40:42	Richard_Florida A class threat, though. My read of Cruz/Trump are that they are diverting strong working class energy into race/religion.

Richard_Florida	698902686209540096	2016-02-14T16:12:40	19.  He's politically like a Scandinavian social democrat -  and those places are among the most competitive in the world.
Richard_Florida	698902558040047616	2016-02-14T16:12:09	18.  Sanders is no danger whatsoever to  creative capitalism.
Richard_Florida	698902404696244224	2016-02-14T16:11:32	17.  In fact, Sanders help to build a creative economy back in Burlington.
Richard_Florida	698902311268126722	2016-02-14T16:11:10	16. Sanders can help run an innovative/ creative economy.
Richard_Florida	698902221770133504	2016-02-14T16:10:49	15. Some may say, well look at the flip side as well, look at Sanders as an outlier on the left.

Richard_Florida	698899905587384321	2016-02-14T16:01:37	8. Many of the current crop of GOP candidates would actively undermine key conditions for capitalist accumulation &amp; reproduction.
Richard_Florida	698899736493948929	2016-02-14T16:00:56	7. Basic rights &amp; equal treatment for women, gays &amp; lesbians, racial &amp; ethnic groups enable greater talent &amp; create a more cohesive society.

Richard_Florida	698899124880596992	2016-02-14T15:58:30	4. On this score a social democrat like Sanders should be much preferable than most of the current GOP candidates.
Richard_Florida	698898940171841537	2016-02-14T15:57:46	3. A key function of government is to maintain the integrity of the economic system &amp; enable so-called "capitalist accumulation."

Richard_Florida	697558934111043585	2016-02-10T23:13:04	Ta-Nehisi Coates is voting Sanders. How big of a problem is this for Clinton? 
Richard_Florida	697557449608470528	2016-02-10T23:07:10	9. Based on this, I submit Burlington reflects if anything more of a creative class social democracy than an older working class variant ...
Richard_Florida	697557250815193090	2016-02-10T23:06:23	8. All of this again suggests that Burlington mirrors a high-road Scandinavian or Nordic country.
Richard_Florida	697557050063265792	2016-02-10T23:05:35	7. This is quite good for a creative economy which tend to have higher inequality &amp; segregation as a result of their large knowledge class.
Richard_Florida	697556919335178240	2016-02-10T23:05:04	6. Burlington ranks 193rd (again  of roughly 350 metros) on our combined measure of inequality-segregation.
Richard_Florida	697554488924758016	2016-02-10T22:55:24	6. To put it another way, Burlington actually looks a lot more like a Scandinavian or Nordic country than most other US metros ...
Richard_Florida	697554269382307842	2016-02-10T22:54:32	5. So I guess this suggests Bernie is a creative class socialist &amp; the creative class is a key force in any left shift in American politics.
Richard_Florida	697553965374955526	2016-02-10T22:53:19	4. Burlington ranks FIFTEENTH in the entire US (again out of 350 plus metros) on my Creativity Index, a composite of those 3Ts.
Richard_Florida	697553774173409280	2016-02-10T22:52:34	4.  Burlington ranks 11th in the nation in technology, 21st in talent, and 61st in tolerance - that is out of 350 plus metros.
Richard_Florida	697553572112789504	2016-02-10T22:51:46	3.  38 percent of Burlington's workforce are members of the creative class, far above the national average &amp; about the same as Seattle.
Richard_Florida	697553341946138624	2016-02-10T22:50:51	2. Burlington is a creative class and creative economy mecca.

Richard_Florida	696418427792130048	2016-02-07T19:41:06	13. BTW, Heideman is correct in pointing out to the progressive left that reformism can work if it is strategic in selecting its partners.
Richard_Florida	696418187685031936	2016-02-07T19:40:09	12. And it would need to include members of the even larger service class (70 million workers 45% of the workforce.)
Richard_Florida	696418008697344000	2016-02-07T19:39:26	11.  The new cross-class coalition could include the progressive elements of the creative class (knowledge workers in "ideopolises" per J/T/

Richard_Florida	696417418361626624	2016-02-07T19:37:06	9. But the nature of the cross-class coalition the Dems can build has changed ... with huge parts of the working class moving into the GOP.

Richard_Florida	696336723983208449	2016-02-07T14:16:26	6) Voters have pitifully little information about him. In this way, Rubio is NOT like Obama at all.
