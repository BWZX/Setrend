DavidSeaburg	691944847868039168	2016-01-26T11:24:42	Not necessarily.....it would depend on how it's structured and cash vs. stock mix.  
DavidSeaburg	691931048079421440	2016-01-26T10:29:51	Gets interesting at $15....But @ $10 I would load up!!!!

DavidSeaburg	686639234539728896	2016-01-11T20:02:05	The words "go to cash" have stirred up a firestorm, here is my in-depth response and analysis -&gt; 
DavidSeaburg	686610226175455232	2016-01-11T18:06:49	2020 guidance wasn't updated which disappointed some... this move lower is a total overreaction. Buy weakness!

DavidSeaburg	685857394140774400	2016-01-09T16:15:20	Look, markets will be volatile, but we are not the facing same systemic liquidity risks like we saw in 2008.  
DavidSeaburg	685827577517338624	2016-01-09T14:16:51	It is irresponsible for Soros to scare the investing public like this....not even a close compare to 2008!
