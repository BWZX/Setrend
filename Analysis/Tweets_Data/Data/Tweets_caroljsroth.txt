caroljsroth	717856276374560768	2016-04-06T23:27:28	JENicodemus and I disagree. Risk is to be encouraged if it makes sense in context of rewards/payoffs. Risk management, not avoidance.

caroljsroth	717853902343966720	2016-04-06T23:18:02	JENicodemus debt is a means of financing which makes sense if used appropriately. If you can do it another way, great.
