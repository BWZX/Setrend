rodrikdani	726204343351959552	2016-04-30T00:19:42	rodrikdani I think Jacques Rueff was using the word in good terms

rodrikdani	726201751930568704	2016-04-30T00:09:24	rodrikdani Yes, "Neoliberalism and its Prospects" was the title of Friedman's paper.
rodrikdani	726201385675542530	2016-04-30T00:07:57	rodrikdani Milton Friedman described himself as a neoliberal. First used in 1951 as I recall.
rodrikdani	726199604778287104	2016-04-30T00:00:52	rodrikdani Wasn't the term coined by Hayek and Co. in Mount Pelerin Society?

rodrikdani	726196692647694337	2016-04-29T23:49:18	rodrikdani Heard it used to describe the positive turn away from pure laissez-faire to more legally supervised capitalism; that count?
rodrikdani	726196694979887109	2016-04-29T23:49:18	rodrikdani Rudolph Hommes, former Colombian finance minister, once called himself the "Pope of neoliberalism" at a lecture. Does it count?
