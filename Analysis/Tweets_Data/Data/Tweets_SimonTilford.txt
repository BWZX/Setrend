SimonTilford	693100790068682754	2016-01-29T15:58:00	8 So the vast majority of EU migrants are in households who earn more than that. Very small number would be cut off
SimonTilford	693100758217146368	2016-01-29T15:57:52	7 If they didn’t earn 7k, they’d be inelgible for benefits. But most UK in-work benefits for families with children
SimonTilford	693100725296087040	2016-01-29T15:57:44	6 Germany suggested making a ‘worker’ in EU law mean someone who earned above a threshold – say 7k
