DrGerardLyons	704635814341451776	2016-03-01T11:54:04	Today The MayorofLondon released a 300 page economic report, written by myself &amp; the excellent economics team at City Hall.
DrGerardLyons	704626515472941056	2016-03-01T11:17:07	Sluggish Eurozone PMI at 51.2 but figures in France of 50.2 &amp; Germany 50.5 particularly weak. As usual the ECB remains the shock absorber.
DrGerardLyons	704626118385651713	2016-03-01T11:15:32	Fundamental problem is the imbalanced nature of the Eurozone, built on shaky foundations &amp; still suffering from lack of demand.
DrGerardLyons	704625849153277952	2016-03-01T11:14:28	Good that Eurozone unemployment rate is down but still too high; 1 in 8 at recent April 2013 peak, now 1 in 10 but 1 in 4 in Spain &amp; Greece.
DrGerardLyons	704617555370049536	2016-03-01T10:41:31	Poor UK manufacturing figures - growing but slowing - recent weaker £ may help but weak demand at home poses policy challenge for Budget.
DrGerardLyons	704560103991713792	2016-03-01T06:53:13	Good news for world economy yesterday was China easing with more to come &amp; India unveiling growth friendly Budget. Both are positive!
DrGerardLyons	704559810071695360	2016-03-01T06:52:03	The last box of India Budget reforms was fiscal - &amp; covered tax reform &amp; fiscal disciple (keep budget deficit down). Overall makes sense.
DrGerardLyons	704559480823013376	2016-03-01T06:50:44	2/ &amp; : financial sector reform (like everyone else); boost efficiency via infrastructure &amp; investment; governance &amp; ease of doing business
DrGerardLyons	704559099699191808	2016-03-01T06:49:14	1/ Next set of pillars in India Budget to do with reform agenda covered: social sector; boost productivity via education &amp; job creation
DrGerardLyons	704558772467929088	2016-03-01T06:47:56	The first 2 pillars in India Budget re farming were: double farmer income in 5 years &amp; a focus on employment in rural sector
DrGerardLyons	704558322129768450	2016-03-01T06:46:08	I thought 9 pillars in India Budget fell into 3 broad groups: farming; supply side reform &amp; fiscal policy. Each of 9 important on their own
DrGerardLyons	704557688575885312	2016-03-01T06:43:37	The day after the India Budget &amp; the general view seems positive of Finance Minister's announcement of his 9 pillars for India
DrGerardLyons	704556982578106368	2016-03-01T06:40:49	China PMI manufacturing index weak in Feb, dipping to 49, lowest since Nov 2011, vs 49.4 in Jan. Another factor explaining policy easing.
DrGerardLyons	704425692499451904	2016-02-29T21:59:07	4/ I still think India could grow at faster pace than present rate; the big boost to infrastructure spend was welcome; rate cut is possible.
DrGerardLyons	704425345714397185	2016-02-29T21:57:44	3/ economic growth in India expected to be 7.6% in current fiscal year so shows benefits for fiscal numbers from solid growth
DrGerardLyons	704424844008562688	2016-02-29T21:55:45	2/ usually the market pays excessive attention to the budget deficit in the Indian Budget &amp; the fact this was kept at 3.5% is a positive
DrGerardLyons	704424525543436289	2016-02-29T21:54:29	1/ a very interesting Indian Budget today, helping rural areas, boosting infrastructure but not pumping as much into banks as some expected

DrGerardLyons	704290310449438721	2016-02-29T13:01:09	7/ The authorities will also be keen to manage the challenge of easier policy without triggering too aggressive a weakening of the currency.
DrGerardLyons	704290003518660608	2016-02-29T12:59:56	6/ Ahead of the imminent Chinese Communist Party meeting &amp; in the wake of G20 the authorities will be keen to use policy to stimulate growth
DrGerardLyons	704289691286315009	2016-02-29T12:58:42	5/ China still has scope to cut reserve requirements further and also plenty of room to ease rates, even towards zero if it so wished,.
DrGerardLyons	704289442790555648	2016-02-29T12:57:42	4/ China has had falling producer prices for some time, low inflation &amp; capital outflows so reserve requirement cut will boost liquidity.
DrGerardLyons	704289149512257536	2016-02-29T12:56:32	3/ While other G20 countries will naturally welcome China's attempts to stimulate growth they will also closely watch currency implications
DrGerardLyons	704288629624086528	2016-02-29T12:54:29	2/ The Chinese authorities have indicated clearly - and they did so again before the G20 - that they have scope to ease monetary policy
DrGerardLyons	704288423562100736	2016-02-29T12:53:39	1/ China's decision to cut reserve requirement ratio today by 0.5% was a good one &amp; highlights the scope they have to ease monetary policy

DrGerardLyons	703869956014940160	2016-02-28T09:10:49	7/ I touched on some of this in the piece I wrote for The Telegraph on Thursday.
DrGerardLyons	703869816730419200	2016-02-28T09:10:16	6/ Meanwhile were we to leave, nothing immediately changes; immediate aim will be stability ahead of a tough phase of negotiation
DrGerardLyons	703869179510784001	2016-02-28T09:07:44	5/ The reality is that the EU has not reformed &amp; shows little willingness to do so in any meaningful way
DrGerardLyons	703869108341727232	2016-02-28T09:07:27	4/ While some Brexit campaigners seem to give the impression of a brave new world from day 1 outside.
DrGerardLyons	703869027580407808	2016-02-28T09:07:08	3/ The EU Remain enthusiasts seem to have created this virtual reality world of an EU as they would like it to be, not as it is.
DrGerardLyons	703868940565520384	2016-02-28T09:06:47	2/ That virtual reality world may be one way of describing some of the first week of the Remain Brexit referendum debate
DrGerardLyons	703868823699595264	2016-02-28T09:06:19	1/ Early this week Radio 4 reported from global tech conference in Madrid: main focus was virtual reality. Could apply to some of EU debate.
DrGerardLyons	703641357504610304	2016-02-27T18:02:27	.Laspeyres Good part of communique G20 agreed to use "all policy tools – monetary, fiscal and structural – individually and collectively"

DrGerardLyons	703638003801980928	2016-02-27T17:49:07	. jameskirkup thanks I have been at similar events before &amp; wires run off their feet to get stories but communiques normally well crafted
DrGerardLyons	703637486447292417	2016-02-27T17:47:04	englishfizz ok the GO was in a retweet - my point was wires stating UK asked to include Brexit as risk but I would be surprised if they did
DrGerardLyons	703635909745504256	2016-02-27T17:40:48	DrGerardLyons Seems to have been more agreement on the notion of monetary fatigue, than on fiscal activism now. 
DrGerardLyons	703636071901491200	2016-02-27T17:41:27	Anyway main story from G20 is that even though world growth is steady, policymakers watching downside risks &amp; still is case for policy boost
DrGerardLyons	703635457511391232	2016-02-27T17:39:00	englishfizz don't understand the question
DrGerardLyons	703634900453335040	2016-02-27T17:36:47	It surely can't be correct that UK officials asked for Brexit to be included in communique but why are wires reporting that they did?
DrGerardLyons	703634536672972800	2016-02-27T17:35:21	Exactly .. Monetary and fiscal policy must both reinforce one another. All hands on deck.  
DrGerardLyons	703634292803575810	2016-02-27T17:34:22	. jameskirkup I hope you are right that Treasury didn't ask for that - it struck me as odd for them to do so - who did ask for it then?
DrGerardLyons	703633679592120320	2016-02-27T17:31:56	You would have thought at G20 that UK officials would have wanted to play down &amp; not stoke up unnecessary fears about their own economy.
DrGerardLyons	703633421223006209	2016-02-27T17:30:55	2/2 ..."but was added after British officials pressed for it." Almost a green light (as if they needed it) for FX markets to push £ weaker
DrGerardLyons	703633111037427712	2016-02-27T17:29:41	1/2 from Reuters .. "The reference to "Brexit" had not been included in earlier versions of the text, according a senior official "......
DrGerardLyons	703632202232434690	2016-02-27T17:26:04	First G20 I can recall where a country has insisted that it added explicitly as a risk in the communique, for that is what the UK has done.
DrGerardLyons	703631489326514179	2016-02-27T17:23:14	Active fiscal policy is the answer .... That is surely an underlying if not an explicit message from G20 ... &amp; continued low interest rates
DrGerardLyons	703631219267870720	2016-02-27T17:22:10	.... US hikes off agenda for domestic reasons anyway... Even more so after G20
DrGerardLyons	703631093250060288	2016-02-27T17:21:40	My read is G20 sets China up to take a lead through active fiscal policy ... But what will Europe do?
DrGerardLyons	703630956431806464	2016-02-27T17:21:07	Despite its positive impact G20 says, "Monetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth."
DrGerardLyons	703630810910466049	2016-02-27T17:20:32	G20 says "The global recovery continues, but it remains uneven and falls short of our ambition for strong, sustainable and balanced growth."
DrGerardLyons	703536338935664641	2016-02-27T11:05:08	At Shanghai G20 China is rightly reissuing others over their economy, while all are in agreement about global risks but not about what to do
DrGerardLyons	703192900335611905	2016-02-26T12:20:26	Am to speak at lunchtime to the Association Of European Journalists in London at Europe House on Why the UK should leave the EU Brexit
DrGerardLyons	703153018850545665	2016-02-26T09:41:58	You have to congratulate China's macro economic policy makers for, more often than not, doing the right thing.
DrGerardLyons	703152649231675392	2016-02-26T09:40:30	I was told that at the IIF conference in Shanghai a China Vice Minister indicated they will use an expansionary fiscal policy - that's good.
DrGerardLyons	703150030832533504	2016-02-26T09:30:05	ICASaccounting this event has been moved to later in the year, possible September/October! Well at least that was what was agreed
DrGerardLyons	703128606520651777	2016-02-26T08:04:57	Earlier this week UK government borrowed so cheaply (&amp; heavily oversubscribed) you would think let's borrow more at those rates to invest
DrGerardLyons	703128149098246145	2016-02-26T08:03:08	If fiscal policy globally gets talked up in Shanghai G20 it will likely be a renewed focus on potential effectiveness of infrastructure
DrGerardLyons	703127731773386752	2016-02-26T08:01:29	I would also expect &amp; perhaps hope the G20 will leave Shanghai with increased confidence about China economy's ability to cope.
DrGerardLyons	703127432174239744	2016-02-26T08:00:17	Signs are this G20 may get policy makers on a similar page re the narrative &amp; downside risks but not necessarily full agreement re policy
DrGerardLyons	703126963129430017	2016-02-26T07:58:26	In recent months IMF &amp; OECD trimmed global growth forecasts; partly managing expectations but still need to give firms confidence to invest
DrGerardLyons	703125932945453057	2016-02-26T07:54:20	3/ I think she &amp; IMF are right to be trying to urge more policy stimulus given impact from monetary policy diminishing; focus back on fiscal
DrGerardLyons	703125405973131266	2016-02-26T07:52:14	2/ my read is having been cautious ahead of this IMF she is hearing what a multi speed global economy there is; different speeds everywhere
DrGerardLyons	703125044092735488	2016-02-26T07:50:48	1/ At G20 in Shanghai the reports of Lagarde's comments vary - some cite her caution, others cite her as saying there is still growth

DrGerardLyons	693415659867357185	2016-01-30T12:49:11	The lesson from recent weeks is when it comes to firms: a simple and transparent tax system - and global standards but national control.
DrGerardLyons	693415424281743365	2016-01-30T12:48:14	UK tax system is too complex - constant interference by Chancellors - have made tax book too big favouring big firms who find way around it

DrGerardLyons	688762163448688640	2016-01-17T16:37:51	I hope the UK takes note of the US where the Fed hike in December seems badly timed. Despite low oil prices, US growth may likely decelerate
