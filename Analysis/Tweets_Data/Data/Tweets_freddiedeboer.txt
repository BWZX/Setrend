freddiedeboer	724440834062598146	2016-04-25T03:32:08	michaelkarenski You're arguing purely by assertion and acting as though it has force behind it. It doesn't.
freddiedeboer	724440753569714180	2016-04-25T03:31:49	michaelkarenski Yes, I 100% believe that. More importantly, you have absolutely no rigorous, fair evidence to prove otherwise.

freddiedeboer	724366191075168256	2016-04-24T22:35:32	The single most obvious way in which the media has attacked the Sanders campaign has been through the propagation of the BernieBro slur.

freddiedeboer	724255918125420544	2016-04-24T15:17:21	The reason for this is that capitalism is a moral nightmare that hates you and wants you to fail.

freddiedeboer	723567578015125504	2016-04-22T17:42:08	laura11D ncarbone True or false: the average American PhD holder has far stronger unemployment and income numbers than the median.
freddiedeboer	723567089852669952	2016-04-22T17:40:12	laura11D ncarbone Look, I'm leaving academia myself. If you can't write without letting your bitterness color your basic analysis, don't.
freddiedeboer	723566987239026688	2016-04-22T17:39:47	laura11D ncarbone That is not data.
freddiedeboer	723566849758105600	2016-04-22T17:39:14	laura11D ncarbone You're aware that the average American doesn't have a bachelor's degree, right.
freddiedeboer	723566682816438273	2016-04-22T17:38:35	laura11D ncarbone Your perspective is an artifact of your privilege. In brute numbers, PhDs continue to dramatically outperform the median
freddiedeboer	723566533474062337	2016-04-22T17:37:59	laura11D ncarbone They are performing better, economically, than a significant majority of Americans.
freddiedeboer	723566281014710273	2016-04-22T17:36:59	laura11D ncarbone And, indeed, the fact that you write for the Atlantic and have a PhD exemplifies the very point I'm making.
freddiedeboer	723566131458383872	2016-04-22T17:36:23	laura11D ncarbone You're writing for the Atlantic. That makes you a journalist.
freddiedeboer	723566049988222976	2016-04-22T17:36:04	ncarbone laura11D The key, as Leonard Cassuto says, is that many of them are doing well OUTSIDE the academy.
freddiedeboer	723565947320033280	2016-04-22T17:35:39	ncarbone laura11D Just in terms of comparing PhDs to median Americans on metrics like unemployment and income.
freddiedeboer	723565813463027712	2016-04-22T17:35:07	ncarbone laura11D Of course the situation is immoral and unsustainable. It remains the case that the average PhD is doing well.
freddiedeboer	723565562584915968	2016-04-22T17:34:07	ncarbone laura11D As usual, I find cultural resentment from journalists against academics makes it hard for them to really get the issues.

freddiedeboer	722817554096398337	2016-04-20T16:01:48	pescami That is not a response: do you have any responsibility, as an adult, for the ways in which you deliberately antagonize one group?
freddiedeboer	722817383224573953	2016-04-20T16:01:08	It's fundamentally a child's attitude: "I am a victim for being criticized when I deliberately set out to antagonize others."

freddiedeboer	722816449446686720	2016-04-20T15:57:25	pescami You take an entirely gratuitous swipe; people will react; you'll use their reaction as a justification for calling them bitter.

freddiedeboer	719955990003601408	2016-04-12T18:30:58	losthunderlads I think that it is beyond naive to argue that these issues will go away if we just ignore them.
freddiedeboer	719955811577925632	2016-04-12T18:30:16	TonyK3ss Then what's the use of racial categories of IQ, given that random chance will be a more powerful influence than said category?
freddiedeboer	719954658161065984	2016-04-12T18:25:41	TonyK3ss You would agree that within-group variation, for racial classifications, regularly exceeds between-group variation, yes?
freddiedeboer	719953556598460416	2016-04-12T18:21:18	losthunderlads "If we ignore this it will go away" is a liberal self-parody and demonstrably untrue. These ideas have not gone away.
freddiedeboer	719953435555028993	2016-04-12T18:20:49	losthunderlads People argue that it is. And thus it is the responsibility of decent people to argue against it.

freddiedeboer	719951075717951488	2016-04-12T18:11:27	losthunderlads I think people who are not in the broad world of educational and psychological measurement underestimate their numbers.
freddiedeboer	719950361482514432	2016-04-12T18:08:36	I'm not afraid to rebut arguments about fundamental racial inferiority precisely because I am confident that the facts are against them.
freddiedeboer	719950063577862144	2016-04-12T18:07:25	But that implies that we need to fear that maybe scientific racism is true. But it isn't true, and that's a conclusion derived from facts.

freddiedeboer	719893088387407873	2016-04-12T14:21:01	I don't get the desire to hide this basic reality: the Dem primary is about whether the Democrats should be a left wing or right wing party.

freddiedeboer	715214363993354244	2016-03-30T16:29:27	HarryStopes People mostly learn those theories in college and college graduation is powerfully associated with relative affluence.

freddiedeboer	714102764570173440	2016-03-27T14:52:21	ForeverMACtion It's very hard to find panels at Cs, for example, that actually help you teach writing more effectively.
freddiedeboer	714102660572381184	2016-03-27T14:51:56	ForeverMACtion a lot of the field seems like a bait and switch to me - getting funding for teaching writing, then dismissing writing itself
freddiedeboer	714102439461322752	2016-03-27T14:51:03	livebeef Well, but we're also seeing a crisis in terms of student loan debts, which necessitates ensuring that people are actually learning

freddiedeboer	714100243789324289	2016-03-27T14:42:20	Fmkurtyka That's because essentially everyone getting educated in college came from a wealthy white male WASP elite.
freddiedeboer	714100155843084288	2016-03-27T14:41:59	Fmkurtyka What people see as the "good old days" was a period in which almost all students were assured of financial good fortune.

freddiedeboer	714098544282456065	2016-03-27T14:35:34	Some of the romantic ideals of college only made sense when college was a finishing school for white male gentiles.
freddiedeboer	714098379291111426	2016-03-27T14:34:55	The "profs should be able to do whatever they want with no external review" attitude stems from an era of explicit inequality in higher ed.
freddiedeboer	714097766528495616	2016-03-27T14:32:29	DanFriedman81 Uh, if students are actually learning would be a big one. And you need to read the whole report if you want to talk about it.
freddiedeboer	714096239839547392	2016-03-27T14:26:25	DanFriedman81 Assessment of some kind is inevitable and should be. So let's do it transparently and well.
freddiedeboer	714096167651381248	2016-03-27T14:26:08	DanFriedman81 Again: we are already assessing in myriad ways. But those assessments are typically ad hoc, lacking validity and reliability.
freddiedeboer	714096045349670916	2016-03-27T14:25:39	DanFriedman81 Yes. And in fact, testing already has.
freddiedeboer	714095982632251393	2016-03-27T14:25:24	DanFriedman81 First of all, there are many types of information to gather that are not simply test score based in nature.
freddiedeboer	714092168390922240	2016-03-27T14:10:14	Absolutely perpetual in ed circles. "The internet is about to change everything!" We had the internet in my junior high in 1995.
freddiedeboer	714092010160783360	2016-03-27T14:09:37	It's like the perpetual "newness" of the internet: people keep writing like the internet is this new thing that's gonna change everything.

freddiedeboer	714080558574227457	2016-03-27T13:24:06	One point I'll make tomorrow: the lack of responsible, low-stakes assessment in college is how things like the US News rankings flourish.

freddiedeboer	713065618505748480	2016-03-24T18:11:06	cruickshank The faculty resisted. They brought up good points. They negotiated. And to a large degree, they won.
freddiedeboer	713065547756273664	2016-03-24T18:10:49	cruickshank Absolutely everything about Purdue's context militated towards NCLB style testing, yet we're getting nothing resembling that.
freddiedeboer	713065240422850560	2016-03-24T18:09:36	cruickshank And yet the universities already successfully opposed the Obama admins plan. Again, your fatalism doesn't impress me.
freddiedeboer	713064422374125568	2016-03-24T18:06:21	cruickshank You are seriously underestimating how powerful of a political lobby colleges and universities are.

freddiedeboer	713063455209619457	2016-03-24T18:02:30	cruickshank The alternative is not the status quo. The alternative is the replacement of most universities with terrible online ed.

freddiedeboer	713017356113616896	2016-03-24T14:59:19	To many people I know in academia, by rejecting any individual invocation of safe space rhetoric, I am rejecting social justice writ large.
freddiedeboer	713017149565091840	2016-03-24T14:58:30	There are many spaces I want to make safer. When Amherst students say safe spaces means punishing speech they don't like, I'm not on board.
freddiedeboer	713016280052285440	2016-03-24T14:55:03	It's not enough the idea that some things are offensive, which no one questions. It's the idea that we all things called offensive are.
freddiedeboer	713015792732909569	2016-03-24T14:53:06	The prevalent attitude within the academic left is that to be a righteous person you have to take all claims of offense equally seriously.
freddiedeboer	713015645177298944	2016-03-24T14:52:31	I never see this point addressed: it's not claims to offense I object to but the idea that I must accept all claims to offense equally.
freddiedeboer	713015483486875648	2016-03-24T14:51:53	Again, the problem is not the concept of safer spaces but the insistence that we have to accept them categorically.

freddiedeboer	712326586112954368	2016-03-22T17:14:27	streever This is about goosing up your follower count, right?
freddiedeboer	712326425135550464	2016-03-22T17:13:48	streever That's a reference to someone else's tweet that in no way says what you're suggesting it says.

freddiedeboer	712313727077318656	2016-03-22T16:23:21	I genuinely believe fears of NCLB like testing in college are unfounded. We can assess and avoid the trap of all testing, all the time.
freddiedeboer	712312816737263616	2016-03-22T16:19:44	More than anything, I tried to write an actually readable policy document. Shot for clarity, concision, and minimal jargon.

freddiedeboer	712312112576466944	2016-03-22T16:16:56	DaveMazella You mean in terms of hitting an arbitrary number on a given test?
freddiedeboer	712308753744289792	2016-03-22T16:03:35	Also, while I strongly believe traditional institutions educate far better than online colleges, we need to prove it empirically to survive.
freddiedeboer	712308599028998145	2016-03-22T16:02:58	But successive presidential administrations have called for standardized testing in college, and just saying no is not an option. highered

freddiedeboer	712299380884111360	2016-03-22T15:26:20	streever And you have no idea how this argument initially got started or what the initial claims are. And, by the way, are keeping it alive
freddiedeboer	712299186230722561	2016-03-22T15:25:34	streever Instead, I would suggest that you are performing, trying to sell yourself as a woke ally for your own enjoyment.
freddiedeboer	712299069851303937	2016-03-22T15:25:06	streever Again: your methods of attack here are varying wildly, which doesn't say much about the substance of that attack.
freddiedeboer	712298831107371008	2016-03-22T15:24:09	Beulahmo Despite what everyone is saying, this was a fight I was initially dragged into, not one I started, way back when. Per usual.
freddiedeboer	712297647885791236	2016-03-22T15:19:27	Because politics is about substance, not about signaling.
freddiedeboer	712297484060459008	2016-03-22T15:18:48	For me the rule is easy and helpful: if you can't name issues of substance on which we disagree, I don't take attacks seriously.
freddiedeboer	712295263914762240	2016-03-22T15:09:59	There's been a complete and total break between anything resembling political substance and the symbols of affected, vague "progressivism."
freddiedeboer	712295101326725121	2016-03-22T15:09:20	On Twitter you could be a millionaire CEO of a predatory lender and if you tweet "YAS QUEEN " people will act like you're Tom Joad.

freddiedeboer	712136703901769728	2016-03-22T04:39:55	If you don't want me to call you out as a foreclosure lawyer, don't repeatedly claim you only did loan modifications when that's not true.
freddiedeboer	712136326552768512	2016-03-22T04:38:25	"I only did loan modifications" is not the same as "yes I did foreclosures for WaMu including reneging on modification agreements." Sorry.

freddiedeboer	711583752791535616	2016-03-20T16:02:41	markyzaguirre Yes, it is. You are simply ignorant of human history, and representing that ignorance with condescension.
freddiedeboer	711583658189041665	2016-03-20T16:02:19	hamandcheese And today we have centrists like yourself calling themselves "progressives" and defending a status quo that gave us Flint, MI.
freddiedeboer	711583297285935104	2016-03-20T16:00:53	Ny1david rortybomb eisingerj Could it be that "empirical" is a word that you deploy meaninglessly for empty rhetorical effect?
freddiedeboer	711583209046212609	2016-03-20T16:00:32	Ny1david rortybomb eisingerj How fares Flint, Michigan, today? That strike you as minimally just? And this is not empiricism.
freddiedeboer	711582638889283584	2016-03-20T15:58:16	markyzaguirre Therefore, social systems can exist in the future that don't exist today. In fact, that is the story of human history.
freddiedeboer	711582556177588224	2016-03-20T15:57:56	markyzaguirre Again: capitalism was unheard of for the vast majority of human history. That means nothing about its current existence.
freddiedeboer	711582471578464256	2016-03-20T15:57:36	markyzaguirre rortybomb No, not thin skin. Just a resistance to someone asking a question that has already been answered.
freddiedeboer	711582281412968448	2016-03-20T15:56:51	markyzaguirre rortybomb Also lol at "in its current form."
freddiedeboer	711582209904250881	2016-03-20T15:56:34	markyzaguirre rortybomb Since you're so obtuse, I'm going to block you.
freddiedeboer	711581675122085888	2016-03-20T15:54:26	markyzaguirre rortybomb Sure. Again: are you under the misapprehension that capitalism is as old as human society?
freddiedeboer	711581544561770500	2016-03-20T15:53:55	markyzaguirre rortybomb How many capitalist countries were there in 1200 AD? But so what?
freddiedeboer	711581225182363648	2016-03-20T15:52:39	markyzaguirre rortybomb Yes, it does.
freddiedeboer	711581175806963714	2016-03-20T15:52:27	Ny1david rortybomb eisingerj How could an argument about the definition of technocracy possibly be resolved through empirical means?
freddiedeboer	711581074137059328	2016-03-20T15:52:03	Ny1david rortybomb eisingerj Name one.
freddiedeboer	711580939189493760	2016-03-20T15:51:31	markyzaguirre rortybomb Again: how fares feudalism? Know a lot of hunter gatherer societies? History changes, sometimes quickly.
freddiedeboer	711579058920763392	2016-03-20T15:44:02	rortybomb eisingerj Technocracy is the illusion that justice springs from an unaccountable managerial class ruling via spreadsheet.
freddiedeboer	711577747697442816	2016-03-20T15:38:50	eisingerj rortybomb Reread your own Twitter bio, friend.
freddiedeboer	711577251968475136	2016-03-20T15:36:51	The galling about liberals is their willingness to discuss as horrifically unjust a system they simultaneously insist can't be changed.
freddiedeboer	711577081532915713	2016-03-20T15:36:11	eisingerj rortybomb Whereas that is not an argument at all, or even an attempt at one. Just blank snark from an elite.
freddiedeboer	711576125332324352	2016-03-20T15:32:23	1927_747A How fares feudalism, now, when there was no named other option on the table for hundreds of years?
freddiedeboer	711575029918486528	2016-03-20T15:28:02	rortybomb Sure: acknowledge that liberal capitalism produces exploitation and poverty inevitably and by design. They can't be reformed out.
freddiedeboer	711574701508792320	2016-03-20T15:26:43	freddiedeboer This seems like the most obvious fact of the modern world that's entirely unspeakable in "serious" company
freddiedeboer	711574551851708418	2016-03-20T15:26:08	Now, whether the post-capitalist future will be GOOD or not is another question. But we will have a post-capitalist future. It's induction.
freddiedeboer	711574154038751232	2016-03-20T15:24:33	People in feudalism thought it was divinely dictated. Romans thought you couldn't have an economy without slavery. And so on.
freddiedeboer	711574031019802626	2016-03-20T15:24:04	Every social system appears to the people within it as the inevitable reality of human affairs. But eventually they all end.
freddiedeboer	711573290448330752	2016-03-20T15:21:07	rortybomb I think like most liberals you know that the means you're willing to countenance will never achieve the ends you say you want.
freddiedeboer	711573194121957376	2016-03-20T15:20:44	rortybomb That's fine. But you represent yourself as someone interested in economic justice, and you're not, really.
freddiedeboer	711571856235495424	2016-03-20T15:15:25	mattyglesias rortybomb Perhaps we'll meet in the middle and both be able to declare victory.
freddiedeboer	711570983354642432	2016-03-20T15:11:57	rortybomb Do you think liberal technocracy is ever going to produce a minimally just and equitable country? How?
freddiedeboer	711570831780872192	2016-03-20T15:11:21	rortybomb Sure, he's no anti-capitalist. But the vector matters, as does the intensity of the rhetoric and the leftward push of policy.
freddiedeboer	711564870366310400	2016-03-20T14:47:39	WolfandRhys Look I would rather have the ACA than nothing. But the refusal of liberals to criticize its many huge flaws is terrible.
freddiedeboer	711562340383068160	2016-03-20T14:37:36	WolfandRhys And liberals always preemptively declare preferences unachievable, in order to prevent them from ever being held to account.
freddiedeboer	711562201719377920	2016-03-20T14:37:03	WolfandRhys That thinking - this isn't good enough but it's better than nothing - is precisely what conservatives don't say.
freddiedeboer	711558110159089664	2016-03-20T14:20:48	This is why people are so angry: elites have nothing to offer suffering people like those described here.

freddiedeboer	711542747165896704	2016-03-20T13:19:45	ddayen It's just inconceivable to people that family and community ties are essential to stability and happiness for the working class.
freddiedeboer	711542642513879040	2016-03-20T13:19:20	ddayen The vast majority of college students attend school within 100 miles of home and a majority within 30 miles of home.

freddiedeboer	711401372139151360	2016-03-20T03:57:58	kimchinam58 That's the bigger problem: the ritualistic announcements of being impressed by other writers, which is inevitably reciprocal.
freddiedeboer	711399472954265601	2016-03-20T03:50:26	(Honest answer: American smart kid culture is poison and follows people into adulthood.)
freddiedeboer	711397434488975360	2016-03-20T03:42:20	Real quote from a real email from a self-identified "old grandma": "Why are writers online so impressed with themselves?"

freddiedeboer	711260312750587904	2016-03-19T18:37:27	I don't begrudge the virtues that come with hard work but I think we are all secretly in love with those who do things effortlessly.
freddiedeboer	711257295947059200	2016-03-19T18:25:28	Passion is cool. Passion is to discipline as life is to taxidermy, an attempt to make something permanent through removal of its essence.
freddiedeboer	711256300697485312	2016-03-19T18:21:31	I think all of the most interesting people I've ever met in my life have been anything but disciplined. Self-imposed rules are for squares.
freddiedeboer	711254920230346752	2016-03-19T18:16:02	Like all other bourgeois virtues, discipline has become just another thing affluent people compete with each other over.

freddiedeboer	710998491506454529	2016-03-19T01:17:04	Media really has an existential problem in that jokiness is so ingrained in the culture its people simply can't get serious when needed.
freddiedeboer	710998271754252288	2016-03-19T01:16:12	WesleyLowery Verdicts that apply to cases that many people hold their noses about inevitably erode rights applicable in other cases.
freddiedeboer	710998026228146177	2016-03-19T01:15:13	WesleyLowery Are you actually asking earnestly? Because way too many of your peers in media are whistling past the graveyard right now.
freddiedeboer	710987853082132480	2016-03-19T00:34:48	Rights are like vaccines: only people who have lived under their protection their whole lives can doubt their importance.

freddiedeboer	710978626603327488	2016-03-18T23:58:08	So many of the cool kids from across the spectrum have been loling over rights talk for years. And they're about to find it isn't funny.
freddiedeboer	710977513133051905	2016-03-18T23:53:43	That the left has become so comfortable with eroding basic rights will be disastrous for us in time. They'll always come for us eventually.

freddiedeboer	710976765771046912	2016-03-18T23:50:44	Rights have to be defended with total conviction even when they're invoked by people you don't like. We've forgotten that and it sucks.
freddiedeboer	710976358764191746	2016-03-18T23:49:07	If you care about a combative free press, don't embed caveats or qualifications in your opinion of the Gawker verdict. It's just bad period.

freddiedeboer	710969685504872448	2016-03-18T23:22:36	But really: if you're a media honcho, just say "no hires from a school that rejects more students than it accepts for three years."

freddiedeboer	710968131087372289	2016-03-18T23:16:26	Want to take it further, ban any graduate from a top 25 school on the US News list. Might as well make that most useful for a change.
freddiedeboer	710967882847535105	2016-03-18T23:15:27	The most meaningful reform big time mega entities could make is to refuse to hire anyone with an Ivy League degree at any level for 3 years.
freddiedeboer	710937201530572800	2016-03-18T21:13:32	Turns out the personal-experiential data available to a uniformly bourgeois press is not very representative.

freddiedeboer	710904678943465472	2016-03-18T19:04:18	double_thunk Sure. But it is a major problem, not a minor one. There are more non native speakers of English than native, after all.

freddiedeboer	710892162406326273	2016-03-18T18:14:33	This is one reason I'm frustrated by automated translation (etc) triumphalism - so rarely reflects real-world diversity in background.

freddiedeboer	710484263003525120	2016-03-17T15:13:43	So much contemporary fiction these days seems to presume that I'm really interested in watching the authors wander around their own minds.

freddiedeboer	710482995044442112	2016-03-17T15:08:40	Honestly I think novelists are rejecting the generation of empathy because they don't have the chops to pull it off.

freddiedeboer	710459950099595268	2016-03-17T13:37:06	christianjbdev Yes, I get that. But that is at best tangential to what I was saying.
freddiedeboer	710459655063871488	2016-03-17T13:35:56	jonsterling The fact that you say that with such verve does not make it universally true.
freddiedeboer	710459357620637696	2016-03-17T13:34:45	jonsterling Intent is precisely what the people who most ardently prosecute the case against offense insist on ignoring.
freddiedeboer	710459248333840384	2016-03-17T13:34:19	jonsterling Laura Kipnis had literal federal charges levied against her for writing an essay. That's chilling and a very big deal.
freddiedeboer	710459128083185671	2016-03-17T13:33:50	jonsterling Uh, because it's clearly not obviously true to everyone, and the refusal to acknowledge the latter hurts real people.
freddiedeboer	710458393169891328	2016-03-17T13:30:55	christianjbdev Who are you talking to? That has nothing to do with what I just said.
freddiedeboer	710458006949867520	2016-03-17T13:29:23	99% of "political correctness" talk presumes that you have to categorically accept or reject all claims of offense, which is bullshit.
freddiedeboer	710457560256524289	2016-03-17T13:27:36	Most claims of offense are legitimate. A few aren't. Problem is, acknowledging the latter gets you categorized as doubting the former.
freddiedeboer	710449744095514624	2016-03-17T12:56:33	Pair this:  with my piece from the NYT Magazine last year: 
freddiedeboer	710447754674180097	2016-03-17T12:48:38	Seems like a big omission to write about the novel's historical relationship to empathy and not right about Tolstoy, also.

freddiedeboer	710204779591569410	2016-03-16T20:43:09	oldmancoyote22 I don't "disappear" anything. The fact that he collaborated with the Gingrich Congress deepens my critique, not undermine it

freddiedeboer	710204526024892416	2016-03-16T20:42:08	oldmancoyote22 In other words, you have a problem with a vast number of people who  have a common complaint with a bad piece of legislation
freddiedeboer	710204293635252224	2016-03-16T20:41:13	oldmancoyote22 What omissions? The fact that Congress has to vote on bills? How on earth could that possibly be an omission?
freddiedeboer	710203952067977217	2016-03-16T20:39:51	oldmancoyote22 Again: do you seriously doubt that the Clinton crime bill exacerbated our over-incarceration problem? Really?

freddiedeboer	710203395513196546	2016-03-16T20:37:39	oldmancoyote22 This is an incredibly weak set of criticisms here.

freddiedeboer	710203273312145412	2016-03-16T20:37:09	oldmancoyote22 What? Are you seriously doubting that the Clinton crime bill had a huge negative impact on the mass imprisonment problem?
freddiedeboer	710202841130999808	2016-03-16T20:35:26	oldmancoyote22 I'm giving him "ownership" of his voting for it and his advocating for it and praising it publicly for over a decade.

freddiedeboer	710202505980940288	2016-03-16T20:34:07	oldmancoyote22 No, I said that Clinton's crime bill contributed to a broader, bad phenomenon, which is indisputably true.

freddiedeboer	705432576299835392	2016-03-03T16:40:07	HeerJeet ckilpatrick seatacAtMcDnlds TheSpork But what do you do in response to that fact? That fact alone is not enough to win victory.
freddiedeboer	705431409364770816	2016-03-03T16:35:28	HeerJeet seatacAtMcDnlds TheSpork No, you drew a self-congratulatory, dishonest and manipulative inference to make yourself feel better.
freddiedeboer	705430658492055554	2016-03-03T16:32:29	HeerJeet You are not the cosmos. Pointing out that your engagement on race is self-congratulatory is not a suggestion that everyone's is.
freddiedeboer	705430171373928449	2016-03-03T16:30:33	HeerJeet seatacAtMcDnlds TheSpork I've never, ever said that. Again - you're just lying. You're a liar, Jeet.

freddiedeboer	705429215840182272	2016-03-03T16:26:45	HeerJeet seatacAtMcDnlds TheSpork I think liberals enjoy making accusations of bigotry so much they've lost sight of doing anything else.
freddiedeboer	705428504435937280	2016-03-03T16:23:56	HeerJeet seatacAtMcDnlds TheSpork Yes, but you can't win a presidential election with accusations of racism and sexism alone.

freddiedeboer	705426705201152000	2016-03-03T16:16:47	TheSpork See, this is why you're into politics, for that reason only: to feel like you're better than others.Not to make change.
freddiedeboer	705426563395928064	2016-03-03T16:16:13	HeerJeet TheSpork themasculinist See that's just a slur; I've never suggested anything like that in my life. You're a liar, Heer.

freddiedeboer	705416547565772801	2016-03-03T15:36:25	"The best defense is a good offense" explains a lot about human social psychology.
freddiedeboer	705413844374560768	2016-03-03T15:25:41	The first refuge of a scoundrel is to complain that people are being mean to them on Twitter.
freddiedeboer	705396965085851650	2016-03-03T14:18:36	Dems &amp; GOP only represent the center-to-right spectrum of opinion on entitlements, taxes, &amp; health care reform.

freddiedeboer	705374475823542273	2016-03-03T12:49:14	This is a claim that a Trump win is impossible by a guy who just said we shouldn't try to persuade Trump voters.

freddiedeboer	705374022775738368	2016-03-03T12:47:26	HeerJeet Of course TRUMP is a racist. That's not the issue here, is it?
freddiedeboer	705372318894141440	2016-03-03T12:40:40	Contrast with socialism: "while there is a lower class, I am in it, while there is a criminal element, I am of it...."

freddiedeboer	705371532000768000	2016-03-03T12:37:33	Liberalism's existential problem: many of its adherents care more about making moral judgements of others than changing their minds.
freddiedeboer	705370923587604480	2016-03-03T12:35:07	HeerJeet What happens in your world if Trump wins? Do you continue to say "no persuading necessary"?

freddiedeboer	705366970045083648	2016-03-03T12:19:25	HeerJeet Maybe it's time to stop preening on Twitter about how righteous you are and work to convince people who believe bad things.
freddiedeboer	705366588254367745	2016-03-03T12:17:54	HeerJeet Spoken like somebody who cares more about being one of the good ones than about actually creating positive change.

freddiedeboer	705364216329273345	2016-03-03T12:08:28	The sole argument that HRC supporters have made in the primary, that their opponents are bigots, will backfire terribly against Trump.

freddiedeboer	705198674209595392	2016-03-03T01:10:40	rsporter You are completely misreading everything that I've said here.
freddiedeboer	705197021641228289	2016-03-03T01:04:06	icambron SamAdlerBell It's really hard to get past the fact that there is no such thing as a real cultural boundary.
freddiedeboer	705195589005414400	2016-03-03T00:58:24	SamAdlerBell I agree with that. But we have to be realistic: any kind of tasty food will become popular and, inevitably, monetized.
freddiedeboer	705194249692663808	2016-03-03T00:53:05	SamAdlerBell Agreed. I just think that discourse has become so vague and so casually invoked as to cease being useful.
freddiedeboer	705193464229720065	2016-03-03T00:49:58	SamAdlerBell But those claims of power dynamics almost universally deny any agency to people of color and non-western cultures.
freddiedeboer	705192670956818432	2016-03-03T00:46:49	SamAdlerBell But India invested great resources in spreading yoga internationally! Of course people will monetize it once it spreads!

freddiedeboer	705189210559537152	2016-03-03T00:33:04	SamAdlerBell How would you go about satisfying the dictates of avoiding cultural appropriation?

freddiedeboer	705187929539420161	2016-03-03T00:27:58	jcfrancisco Because diversity in all things is the glory of the human world. And I refuse to stop eating Korean barbecue. It's delicious.
freddiedeboer	705187506560569344	2016-03-03T00:26:17	I mean it, seriously: in both cases you're condemned to consuming only those cultural artifacts that descend from white progenitors.
freddiedeboer	705187310980239360	2016-03-03T00:25:31	A white person completely avoiding what's defined as cultural appropriation is functionally identical to the habits of a white supremacist.
freddiedeboer	705185770676600834	2016-03-03T00:19:24	jlim04 Sure - but the way to fix that is to write good, diverse roles. I'm not sure getting upset about this one casting choice helps.
freddiedeboer	705185285517254656	2016-03-03T00:17:28	jlim04 Why?
freddiedeboer	705184691691855872	2016-03-03T00:15:06	NyeBeverage No doubt these are complex issues. But blanket presumptions of appropriation don't help, I think.
freddiedeboer	705183978282729472	2016-03-03T00:12:16	The idea that Chinese people could have made the rational decision to spread kung fu to Americans is erased, preserving white control.
