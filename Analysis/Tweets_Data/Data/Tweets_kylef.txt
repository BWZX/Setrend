kylef	700904518167326721	2016-02-20T04:47:13	czwalsh talktoskirt Yup I hear it. No legal reason and sets dangerous potential loophole going forward.
kylef	700903549496987648	2016-02-20T04:43:23	czwalsh talktoskirt We disagree that it's abhorrent, but I take your point that there's no reason from a legal standpoint.
kylef	700902371849740288	2016-02-20T04:38:42	talktoskirt czwalsh But they're dealing from a position of strength. You can burn the field without salting the earth too.
kylef	700902242207924224	2016-02-20T04:38:11	talktoskirt czwalsh I get it. They can't set a legal precedent for artists getting out of contracts due to unproven rape allegations.

kylef	700900533834395650	2016-02-20T04:31:24	czwalsh talktoskirt It's still perplexing to me that Sony isn't doing something to at least give an illusion of "caring" about the artist.
kylef	700899773969117185	2016-02-20T04:28:22	talktoskirt czwalsh That previous testimony is terribly damning.
kylef	700898641523781632	2016-02-20T04:23:52	czwalsh talktoskirt Oh has to. It'd be a sign of weakness not to counter-sue.
kylef	700897519862046720	2016-02-20T04:19:25	talktoskirt Totally fair point and it would be disingenuous for me to speak to that at all as I have zero experience there.
kylef	700897209320013825	2016-02-20T04:18:11	talktoskirt I'd still say there's a pretty wide canyon between "legally OK" and "non-shitty"

kylef	700895736834076672	2016-02-20T04:12:20	talktoskirt Yeah from a strictly legal point of view its gotten very convoluted and contradictory.
kylef	700895366674120704	2016-02-20T04:10:52	talktoskirt I think a better case could've been built around continued trauma of being involved with Sony as an entity.
kylef	700894826108026882	2016-02-20T04:08:43	talktoskirt I read that, and it's an incredibly shitty thing to have on the record if it's untrue.
kylef	700894252239179777	2016-02-20T04:06:26	talktoskirt The argument by her lawyer (Sony shielding the guy because he makes them more money) was definitely a bit of a stretch.
kylef	700893888819523585	2016-02-20T04:04:59	talktoskirt I would imagine Sony is banking on public to forget the whole thing by the time her next album drops.
