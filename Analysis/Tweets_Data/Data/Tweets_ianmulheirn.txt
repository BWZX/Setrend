ianmulheirn	722149017350770688	2016-04-18T19:45:17	jamieamartin1 so HMT not partial on econ, just disagree w you on deal. Hell of gamble for Brexit ppl to pin all on 'they don't mean it'
ianmulheirn	722147919688830976	2016-04-18T19:40:55	jamieamartin1 only source of anyone's 'inaccuracy' is surely nature of deal assumed. Once that's known, economics pretty clear on impact
ianmulheirn	722147232846331904	2016-04-18T19:38:11	Gilesyb agreed. Guess argument is that if rate of rebound proportionate to scale of deviation from trend, even 3.5% not great
ianmulheirn	722140920683110406	2016-04-18T19:13:06	jamieamartin1 so your case for Brexit is fully reliant on idea that the deal would be much better than EU partners will ever say ex ante?
ianmulheirn	722140570538393601	2016-04-18T19:11:43	jamieamartin1 I take it you do agree that *if* trade deal were WTO or FTA, the impact would be as bad as all these economists say? 1/2

ianmulheirn	722139980311752704	2016-04-18T19:09:22	jamieamartin1 less control in most areas: if you want trade deals you’ll have to accept our two massive trading partners’ rules.
ianmulheirn	722139549271506944	2016-04-18T19:07:39	gilesyb why would it not be if trend growth unchanged? And if it were unchnged (big if of course) wld 3.5% really be absurd? Mid 80s for eg
ianmulheirn	722130537675157504	2016-04-18T18:31:51	jamieamartin1 OE's work showed that you can mitigate the damage, but political viability of necessary measures questionable post Brexit
ianmulheirn	722130085160054788	2016-04-18T18:30:03	jamieamartin1 I don't think HMT, IMF, LSE are involved in conspiracy. Nor that Macron/Schauble/Froman are lying re trade deals

ianmulheirn	703734730685063168	2016-02-28T00:13:29	Widerife81 near enough. Because it will require unanimity
ianmulheirn	703733246627094529	2016-02-28T00:07:35	Birdyword ultimately, whole existence of Brexit threat shows populism trumps econ. Baffling to argue tht ppl of continent somehow different

ianmulheirn	703724654377172993	2016-02-27T23:33:26	andrew_lilico Jonathan_Todd ..why will a snubbed EU populace listen to its financial/political elite? It simply won't in my view
ianmulheirn	703724430606917632	2016-02-27T23:32:33	andrew_lilico Jonathan_Todd Trump, Le Pen, Corbyn, SNP, Brexit - all show triumph of populism over economics...
ianmulheirn	703723997796704256	2016-02-27T23:30:50	Widerife81 Birdyword they won't 'refuse to trade' they'll say 'carry on paying and you can access the mkt on same terms'.
ianmulheirn	703723657147891712	2016-02-27T23:29:29	Cadwalladered for reasons I just said it's neither the smart economic nor political decision for rEU
ianmulheirn	703723250719846400	2016-02-27T23:27:52	Birdyword agree we'd get better deal in that situation- still not God deal. How can bloc hang together if ppl can get goodies fm outside?
ianmulheirn	703722686812442624	2016-02-27T23:25:37	andrew_lilico Jonathan_Todd pretty obvious that in an EU on brink, technocratic decisions will be trumped by populism
ianmulheirn	703722422684491783	2016-02-27T23:24:34	Exactly 
ianmulheirn	703721330387111936	2016-02-27T23:20:14	ianmulheirn Jonathan_Todd Other than the "they will be so desperate to trade with us..." argument, there isn't one.
ianmulheirn	703722286126403586	2016-02-27T23:24:02	Birdyword ...and then of course there's populism. Will a country that might vote Le Pen want to hear about the importance of trade with UK?
ianmulheirn	703721901160591360	2016-02-27T23:22:30	Birdyword what they have to lose by rest of bloc dissolving far greater than what they have to lose by screwing the UK...
ianmulheirn	703721746847965186	2016-02-27T23:21:53	Birdyword think only way to think abt it is with game theory. They will clearly minmax us pour encourager les autres...

ianmulheirn	702831546596794368	2016-02-25T12:24:33	My prediction is that within five years of Brexit the rump of the UK will be asking if it can join Ireland.
