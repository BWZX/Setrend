jbendery	700002577950318592	2016-02-17T17:03:14	C_Hill_8 indeed- versus a uterus!
jbendery	700002100089090049	2016-02-17T17:01:20	C_Hill_8 they certainly have a case to make about putting a woman in the WH for the first time. but she's got a platform to run on.

jbendery	700001887765053440	2016-02-17T17:00:30	thrashRadical exactly. so why reduce HRC to a uterus &amp; suggest she's entitled to WH because of it (which has literally never happened)?
jbendery	700001362042560512	2016-02-17T16:58:24	PrinceTrilliam i get that, but why not just say that then? vs talking about her uterus and not focusing on their policy differences?
jbendery	700000931270754304	2016-02-17T16:56:42	PrinceTrilliam i suspect some will vote for her because she is a woman. history being made. some won't. fair nuff.
