JamilSmith	725868157118898176	2016-04-29T02:03:49	Treadwell's lack of speed must have scared Hue Jackson and the Browns. I shouldn‚Äôt complain: they picked a WR, and Coleman is a burner.

JamilSmith	725855667240747012	2016-04-29T01:14:11	KhefrenJohnson It actually seems like Hue thinks Rob is that dude this year. Even still, Paxton can‚Äôt play this year. He‚Äôs two years away.

JamilSmith	725854954414587908	2016-04-29T01:11:21	I‚Äôll pass. Give me Dak or Cardale in the 4th. Like you said, the Browns should take a wide receiver now. 
JamilSmith	725854419863130112	2016-04-29T01:09:14	I‚Äôm all for NFL draftees being able to smoke up without having their careers affected (or ruined). But a gas mask bong, though.

JamilSmith	725846425200893953	2016-04-29T00:37:27	It‚Äôs to Sanders‚Äôs credit that he‚Äôs focusing on advocating an agenda rather than attacking, but these are old ideas. 
JamilSmith	725842507838398465	2016-04-29T00:21:54	There's remarkably little media hype about America likely electing its first woman president. Seems like a big deal.

JamilSmith	723678132058906624	2016-04-23T01:01:26	You should read jbouie‚Äôs response to emmettrensin‚Äôs ‚Äúsmug liberalism‚Äù essay. We all should keep discussing this. 
JamilSmith	723675598854479872	2016-04-23T00:51:22	I'm not asking you to defend Sanders, emmettrensin, nor to criticize him. I'm curious why he went unmentioned in your essay.
JamilSmith	723675408424669184	2016-04-23T00:50:37	It never mentioned Sanders at all. Which I found odd, for reasons I've stated earlier. 
JamilSmith	723674761293914112	2016-04-23T00:48:02	Though I disagree with Sanders in that specific regard, emmettrensin, I'm open to hearing arguments in support of his political theory.
JamilSmith	723674429277016065	2016-04-23T00:46:43	I find it curious, emmettrensin, that you didn't at least examine Sanders's theory of political argument in the course of the essay.
JamilSmith	723674202738450432	2016-04-23T00:45:49	Sanders is hardly alone, emmettrensin, but he's explicitly argued that the GOP would be fringe if conservatives got better information.
JamilSmith	723674072777895936	2016-04-23T00:45:18	And I ‚Äúliterally‚Äù just told you, emmettrensin: a tweet. But again, as I wrote earlier, it was the self-satisfaction the length conveyed.
JamilSmith	723673606094487553	2016-04-23T00:43:27	Shit, a tweet probably would‚Äôve gotten the job done. But word count, in and of itself, isn‚Äôt the point. 
JamilSmith	723673171556208640	2016-04-23T00:41:43	And for all the words in your essay, emmettrensin, the candidate who adopts the very approach you decry goes unmentioned: Bernie Sanders.
JamilSmith	723672632802062337	2016-04-23T00:39:35	If you intend to scold a particular class of liberals, emmettrensin, okay. But essay length conveys, in a way, its own self-satisfaction.
JamilSmith	723672294325923841	2016-04-23T00:38:14	I just felt you paint liberalism with an awfully broad brush, emmettrensin, in making that indictment.
JamilSmith	723671436888530944	2016-04-23T00:34:50	Yes, emmettrensin, I agree. That is wrong. But why did you need 6,000+ words to express that, I wonder?
JamilSmith	723669404026867712	2016-04-23T00:26:45	However, emmettrensin, it‚Äôs odd that an essay that purports to call liberals on their smugness is itself so ponderous and didactic.
JamilSmith	723669191606321152	2016-04-23T00:25:55	Look, emmettrensin, we both surely know the smug folks on social media who like to remind us how much they know and have read. I get that.
JamilSmith	723668753913917440	2016-04-23T00:24:10	Perhaps, emmettrensin, but in taking the approach you did, you put the onus almost entirely on the Left to repair political rhetoric.
JamilSmith	723668379941388288	2016-04-23T00:22:41	Good Lord, emmettrensin. That was cut down from 12,000 words? No offense, man, but they weren‚Äôt done. That needed to be much more concise.
JamilSmith	723667322209230848	2016-04-23T00:18:29	It‚Äôs correct to note that liberal smugness can turn some people off. But those turned-off people, many times, are liberals themselves.
JamilSmith	723667089551167488	2016-04-23T00:17:33	emmettrensin Duly noted, but why didn‚Äôt you detail that in the essay? Honest question. It really skews your later arguments.
JamilSmith	723666668107472896	2016-04-23T00:15:53	Also, by waxing poetic about liberal smugness, emmettrensin (perhaps inadvertently) lets the willful ignorance of the Right off the hook.
JamilSmith	723666447587762176	2016-04-23T00:15:00	For one, emmettrensin completely ignores the fact that working-class white left the Left largely because blacks were invited to the party.
JamilSmith	723665221324312581	2016-04-23T00:10:08	Liberals can be smug as all hell, but this Vox essay is rubbish.

JamilSmith	722611887565860864	2016-04-20T02:24:34	Seems timely to recall she was shoved out in '08 while winning the popular vote but Bernie has less and no one is telling him to do that.
JamilSmith	722611898240397313	2016-04-20T02:24:36	Bernie's speech was one of his most combative to Hillary yet; Hillary talking as if she's the nominee

JamilSmith	722541090088304640	2016-04-19T21:43:14	The election has already been ridiculous, cynical, and depressing. Here's 15 reasons, from me, to still go and vote.

JamilSmith	722505878201626624	2016-04-19T19:23:19	The voter registration deadline in New York was March 25. I took issue with the October change-of-party deadline. 
JamilSmith	722505497916661761	2016-04-19T19:21:48	Every bit of this is false. I mean, every word. 
JamilSmith	722500027252350976	2016-04-19T19:00:04	Perhaps we should have a conversation, Lee. This kind of stuff should be beneath any journalist. 
JamilSmith	722485551492947968	2016-04-19T18:02:33	I agree with noboa, but read this whole thread for necessary perspective on New York voting. 
JamilSmith	722478450649534464	2016-04-19T17:34:20	Voters in New York could register to vote as recently as March 25. Our much-too-early change-of-party deadline is the issue, seanmcelwee.
JamilSmith	722475356188471298	2016-04-19T17:22:02	The belief that this campaign is developing a legitimacy problem is so closely tied to one‚Äôs choice of candidate.

JamilSmith	722454555838058497	2016-04-19T15:59:23	This michelleinbklyn piece casts grave doubt on the larger systemic engagements of the Sanders revolution:

JamilSmith	722451563042770944	2016-04-19T15:47:29	gregjkrieg Indeed not. I never mentioned Clinton, nor Sanders. It isn‚Äôt about them. I noted earlier that the deadline is ridiculous.
JamilSmith	722450861373460483	2016-04-19T15:44:42	gregjkrieg I feel false claims of voter suppression lessen the focus on, and impact of, legitimate complaints in other states.

JamilSmith	722446603974520836	2016-04-19T15:27:47	The more folks in New York act like their votes are being suppressed by annoying deadlines, the less focus we put on actual suppression.
JamilSmith	722445341623259137	2016-04-19T15:22:46	Having a ridiculously early change-of-party deadline and a closed primary in New York is annoying, but it is not voter suppression.

JamilSmith	718266749263720448	2016-04-08T02:38:32	It's weird to see folks still trotting out the "first black president" phrase for billclinton when we've had an actual one for seven years.
JamilSmith	718266352948154369	2016-04-08T02:36:57	As tanehisicoates reminded us not long ago, calling billclinton the "first black president" was not a compliment. 
JamilSmith	718266186853715968	2016-04-08T02:36:18	Sorry to interject on a conversation clearly not meant for us, but that's an utter misuse of Morrison's phrase. 
JamilSmith	718260906598207488	2016-04-08T02:15:19	I truly wish politicians would stop trying to make black people feel better, and focus on doing better by us.

JamilSmith	718043744298266625	2016-04-07T11:52:23	The campus free speech debate has long been light on real data from students. That could be changing: 
JamilSmith	718062920433856512	2016-04-07T13:08:35	Phenomenal.  
JamilSmith	718011804723470336	2016-04-07T09:45:28	The uninsured rate for adults has fallen lower than any time Gallup has measured it.  
JamilSmith	717924253304270848	2016-04-07T03:57:35	The article Sanders links as evidence doesn't have any quotes from Clinton saying he's not qualified to be POTUS. 
JamilSmith	717917979917336576	2016-04-07T03:32:39	All of Sanders' reasons why Clinton isn't qualified -- except for the Iraq war vote -- are true for Pres Obama, too 
JamilSmith	717916840446595072	2016-04-07T03:28:07	The Sanders camp is fundraising off of Clinton's Wednesday Morning_Joe appearance. His remark makes more sense now. 
JamilSmith	717914623987609600	2016-04-07T03:19:19	Let's say Clinton called Sanders "unqualified" first. She didn't, but it's clear he thinks she did. Why go this route? For an applause line?
JamilSmith	717912073997590529	2016-04-07T03:09:11	If you disagree with her, that's one thing. But arguing that HillaryClinton isn't qualified to be President of the United States is silly.
JamilSmith	717909242297126912	2016-04-07T02:57:56	Clinton criticized Sanders on Wednesday for his stance on the Sandy Hook lawsuit against gun manufacturers. 
JamilSmith	717906510811111433	2016-04-07T02:47:04	Sanders, responding to Clinton's criticism of his Daily News interview, says she isn't "qualified" to be president.

JamilSmith	717872534830596096	2016-04-07T00:32:04	Many men don't do either of those things. Why not just criticize what Cruz said, rather than giving him "advice"? 
JamilSmith	717860220257640449	2016-04-06T23:43:08	‚ÄúEvery rape is not a gender-motivated hate crime,‚Äù wrote the judge who tossed out all of Kesha‚Äôs abuse claims. 
JamilSmith	717860017299394560	2016-04-06T23:42:19	Ted Cruz was wrong. But what does "being a man" have to do with anything, let alone being a leader? Or presidential?

JamilSmith	717844268786827268	2016-04-06T22:39:45	Hillary Clinton should support a national $15 minimum wage. Why? Because of folks like Chantel Walker. My latest. 
JamilSmith	717841926649679873	2016-04-06T22:30:26	Hillary Clinton laughed out loud when she was asked during an interview about a Sanders aide lamenting her ambition. 
JamilSmith	717805324665638912	2016-04-06T20:05:00	Stay small and you'll be a better person = such a message women internalize. Fuck that noise.
JamilSmith	717803395810078720	2016-04-06T19:57:20	Today is the day I stop apologizing for any and all ambition. I've been doing this my whole life and I see clearly now that it's fucked.
JamilSmith	717805245917605888	2016-04-06T20:04:41	Got an email from a dude wanting me to know that he, unlike Gay Talese,  has read women writers and respects them. I'm carving him a medal.
JamilSmith	717834916524855296	2016-04-06T22:02:35	Get to know nhannahjones and her exceptional journalism. Amplify voices like hers. Seems the best response to this. 
JamilSmith	717721464003293184	2016-04-06T14:31:46	Holy hell. Sigh. So common, so infuriating. 
JamilSmith	717789151081402368	2016-04-06T19:00:44	You can be a feminist, identify as pro-life, and not want to outlaw abortion. But that makes you pro-choice. 
JamilSmith	717758283415683074	2016-04-06T16:58:04	Possibly, noboa, but Sanders isn't likely to be the nominee. In light of that, Weaver is trying to use whatever leverage he thinks he has.
JamilSmith	717753729475338240	2016-04-06T16:39:58	I think you‚Äôre right, noboa. But I‚Äôd prioritize a good debate about Sanders‚Äôs position on guns, for instance, over his self-preservation.
JamilSmith	717751209420046336	2016-04-06T16:29:58	The nine-year-old crime reporter from Pennsylvania claps back at the haters. 
JamilSmith	717745488062259200	2016-04-06T16:07:14	Unless, noboa, the Sanders camp believes that he could win in a three-way race. But this seems more about wooing superdelegates to me.
JamilSmith	717744414131666944	2016-04-06T16:02:58	I agree, noboa. That would seem to contradict the priority Sanders himself has conveyed: preventing a GOP victory in November. Unless...
JamilSmith	717740873333743616	2016-04-06T15:48:53	The "ambition" attack on Clinton is old, and undeniably gendered. To the point of parody. Ten years ago. 
JamilSmith	717739121268158466	2016-04-06T15:41:56	Also, the "ambition" attack is ridiculous to levy against any presidential candidate. They're all ambitious. They're running for president.
JamilSmith	717738309976502273	2016-04-06T15:38:42	That quote from Jeff Weaver doesn't make any sense. How would Clinton winning "destroy" TheDemocrats? Most Democrats are voting for her.
JamilSmith	717733361280802818	2016-04-06T15:19:02	‚ÄúDon‚Äôt destroy the Democratic Party to satisfy the secretary‚Äôs ambitions to become president,‚Äù said a Sanders aide. 
JamilSmith	717692068555055105	2016-04-06T12:34:57	Line HillaryClinton should drop: "...I feel sorry for the young people who are fed this list of misrepresentations."  It's patronizing.
JamilSmith	717720068868612096	2016-04-06T14:26:13	Can the troubled Cleveland police handle a volatile Republican Convention?  
JamilSmith	717720009808723969	2016-04-06T14:25:59	And, for the people of Cleveland, an equally important question from JamilSmith  
JamilSmith	717719633034395648	2016-04-06T14:24:29	The bullshit videos alleging falsehoods about PPact produced a spike in serious threats against abortion providers. 
JamilSmith	717709818103013376	2016-04-06T13:45:29	Read petereavis on whether Sanders flubbed the NYDailyNews question on big banks. He says no. 
JamilSmith	717700722343743492	2016-04-06T13:09:21	Hillary just hammered Bernie for not being a real Democrat. It's all about the map to come: 
JamilSmith	717700824214945792	2016-04-06T13:09:45	It's all part of the plan. 
JamilSmith	717690868950413312	2016-04-06T12:30:11	Families of Sandy Hook massacre victims are upset with BernieSanders for defending gun manufacturer immunity. 
JamilSmith	717609168614645760	2016-04-06T07:05:32	Sanders has spent several decades focused on one political issue and he still can't answer basic questions about it. That's worrying.
JamilSmith	717608289454931968	2016-04-06T07:02:03	Don't get me wrong, I listen to Bernie and cheer. But a president has to put big ideas into action. That requires boring governance details.
JamilSmith	717547146568929280	2016-04-06T02:59:05	Thanks to JamilSmith and NifMuhammad for a great event tonight! 
JamilSmith	717549622621822976	2016-04-06T03:08:56	Sexism is wild. It will have you saying that a dominant women's team is bad for basketball while you reminisce about the Bulls from the 90s.
JamilSmith	717548043172777989	2016-04-06T03:02:39	The UConn women's basketball team has done something unlike any sports team in history. The idea that it's bad for the game is absurd.

JamilSmith	717546815831339009	2016-04-06T02:57:46	Unlike these pouty men on Twitter tonight, I'd think John Wooden would be proud that Geno Auriemma broke his NCAA basketball titles record.
JamilSmith	717544622520713217	2016-04-06T02:49:04	The dominance of UConn women's basketball is one of the more staggering athletic achievements we've seen.

JamilSmith	717369661021626368	2016-04-05T15:13:49	Trump has a ‚Äúprivatized mercenary force‚Äù that is tracking and rooting protesters, as well as patrolling events. 
JamilSmith	717344217786241024	2016-04-05T13:32:43	What will the GOP convention do to Cleveland? Nothing good, JamilSmith rightly fears: 
JamilSmith	717342347739193344	2016-04-05T13:25:17	Greg Hardy is an unemployed football player and a domestic abuser. Don't put mikes or cameras in front of him. 
JamilSmith	717201777771339776	2016-04-05T04:06:43	Michael Jordan really had that "game recognize game" look on his face after Jenkins hit that shot.
JamilSmith	717193301233967105	2016-04-05T03:33:02	That Jenkins boy can shoot. Congratulations, Villanova. We just lost our voices in here.
JamilSmith	717187516445679616	2016-04-05T03:10:03	Movement politics, of course, can work in conjunction with White House agendas. I just don't see it working how Sanders is saying it will.
JamilSmith	717185861637521411	2016-04-05T03:03:28	Implying that better information is all Republicans need to have in order to agree with liberals isn't just simplistic. It's insulting.
JamilSmith	717182171157495808	2016-04-05T02:48:48	Sanders is displaying staggering confidence in his ability to convert supporter enthusiasm into actual policy. I wish it worked like that.
JamilSmith	717181593190842368	2016-04-05T02:46:31	The Sanders view of modern Republicanism betrays not a na√Øvet√©, but arrogance on his part. He's buying his own hype. 
JamilSmith	717180407960174593	2016-04-05T02:41:48	As jbarro noted, it seems Sanders truly believes his bizarre thesis about Republican voters being poorly informed subconscious liberals.
JamilSmith	717179754986741761	2016-04-05T02:39:12	Sanders speaks about these consequences his opponents will face as if he is unfamiliar with race-based gerrymandering or voter-ID laws.
JamilSmith	717178214595096576	2016-04-05T02:33:05	If I'm reading correctly, Sanders is counting on opponents of his agenda to "pay a very heavy political price." How long would that take?
JamilSmith	717177877511413761	2016-04-05T02:31:45	I unreservedly applaud Sanders for how he has inspired many to engage in the political process. We all should. But that answer is a mess.

JamilSmith	717172724301504512	2016-04-05T02:11:16	.MTVNews is taking over YaleHumanists Week tomorrow night with a talk by JamilSmith and reading by NifMuhammad: 
JamilSmith	717171046269452288	2016-04-05T02:04:36	I wonder if Morgan Freeman called Tim Robbins and said, ‚ÄúSo, Andy, I heard you think I‚Äôm a ‚Äòsheep.‚Äô Get busy dying.‚Äù 
JamilSmith	717168659987349505	2016-04-05T01:55:07	I know she wants the Hyde Amendment repealed, but HillaryClinton can‚Äôt be out here saying a fetus is a ‚Äúperson.‚Äù 
JamilSmith	717165928987885568	2016-04-05T01:44:16	Go Wildcats, because: 1. My wife played basketball for Villanova. 2. I want PatMcCroryNC to be unhappy. 3. Should I need any other reasons?
JamilSmith	717074663130705925	2016-04-04T19:41:36	The NCAA shifts $2.2 billion a year from black athletes to mostly white beneficiaries. My VICESports deep dive: 
JamilSmith	717146649454358528	2016-04-05T00:27:39	Opioid addiction is at epidemic levels. fivefifths argues that we need universal health care to fight it. 
JamilSmith	717122083336155137	2016-04-04T22:50:02	Democracy benefited when the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to "one person, one vote" today. As did Democrats. 
JamilSmith	717120493082525696	2016-04-04T22:43:43	This is a very smart observation from benwallacewells. Read him on Trump and Sanders.  
JamilSmith	717116757341835264	2016-04-04T22:28:52	Sadness in life doesn‚Äôt always give birth to poignancy on the page. This, by uugwuu, is an exception. Read it. 
JamilSmith	717102903979339776	2016-04-04T21:33:50	What's winning Oklahoma like, then? 
JamilSmith	717038337232646145	2016-04-04T17:17:16	gigilovestheo When said candidate is as successful as Sanders, is it that strange? He may come up short, but he‚Äôs earned the attention.
JamilSmith	717032445741252608	2016-04-04T16:53:51	gigilovestheo Theoretically, I'd agree. But I'm not attacking Sanders. I'm critiquing justifications offered by his own advisors.
JamilSmith	717020334252277761	2016-04-04T16:05:43	The FightFor15NY victory rally is happening now. You can watch it here. 
JamilSmith	717019222019325952	2016-04-04T16:01:18	bomani_jones Appreciate that, brother.
JamilSmith	717015825312518145	2016-04-04T15:47:48	Martin Luther King, Jr. was murdered 48 years ago today. In January, I wrote about those who lay claim to him. 
JamilSmith	717014473953775617	2016-04-04T15:42:26	Congressman, I‚Äôm sorry for your loss. 
JamilSmith	717006203478478848	2016-04-04T15:09:34	The activists who stopped the fracking industry in New York state have put HillaryClinton in their sights. 
JamilSmith	717003333114966016	2016-04-04T14:58:10	Jeffrey Pendleton, a homeless black man unable to pay a $100 bail, was found dead in a New Hampshire jail cell. 
JamilSmith	717000855547936768	2016-04-04T14:48:19	Always good to see gerrymandering take an L, especially in the Supreme Court. Still waiting for these cases, though. 
JamilSmith	716999353056038913	2016-04-04T14:42:21	Conservatives wanted the ability to redistrict by voter population. The Supreme Court just said no, unanimously. 
JamilSmith	716998488026910720	2016-04-04T14:38:55	Perhaps that nytimes report is a Sanders campaign reaction to increased attention on his attacks. It says, ‚ÄúHey, we‚Äôre making him do this.‚Äù
JamilSmith	716996803523125248	2016-04-04T14:32:13	They‚Äôre saying it isn‚Äôt Bernie‚Äôs fault. That supporters shouldn‚Äôt penalize him for their errors. It could work. 
JamilSmith	716996042256846848	2016-04-04T14:29:12	cidelson This isn‚Äôt the media saying it: it‚Äôs Sanders‚Äôs own advisors and surrogates. And if Clinton had his deficit, yes, I think it would.
JamilSmith	716994677652652032	2016-04-04T14:23:46	‚ÄúHe was too nice to try to defeat Hillary Clinton‚Äù and ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd have gone for Southern states, but Super Tuesday!‚Äù are interesting arguments.
JamilSmith	716993186414125057	2016-04-04T14:17:51	Folks, Bernie attacked Hillary as too beholden to Wall Street literally days after he announced, last May: 
JamilSmith	716830855839223808	2016-04-04T03:32:48	At least the Sanders campaign is going out with the narrative that they lost because Bernie is too much of a gentleman.
JamilSmith	716991912696107008	2016-04-04T14:12:47	The Sanders advisors and surrogates quoted here by patrickhealynyt and Yamiche talk as if his campaign is over.

JamilSmith	716778817986117633	2016-04-04T00:06:01	Reading this made me recall Proverbs 16:18: "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before the fall." 
JamilSmith	716755760064159745	2016-04-03T22:34:24	The Panama Papers, per Snowden, are the ‚Äúbiggest leak in the history of data journalism.‚Äù Details, from Mashable.

JamilSmith	716718895223214080	2016-04-03T20:07:55	Read all of scATX‚Äôs tweets today on KeshaRose and rape accusations. Then read her story.  
JamilSmith	716717343708209153	2016-04-03T20:01:45	I just got around to reading the nytimes report on the NFL misrepresenting concussion research. You should, too. 
JamilSmith	716696645480656896	2016-04-03T18:39:30	"I have no intention at this point of having the City of Flint sue the state," said its mayor. ("At this point.") 
JamilSmith	715919046269616128	2016-04-01T15:09:36	We can't keep "waiting for primaries in predominantly non-white states before we can talk about racism" -JamilSmith 
JamilSmith	716632948829732864	2016-04-03T14:26:24	Bernie Sanders hasn't released his full tax returns. Neither have Ted Cruz or John Kasich. DavidCayJ asks why not.

JamilSmith	716577609052717056	2016-04-03T10:46:30	The Allen Building sit-in for campus worker rights at DukeU is worth watching. But the university may end it today. 
JamilSmith	716575011364954113	2016-04-03T10:36:10	Life is too short for hatred.
JamilSmith	716574375286157314	2016-04-03T10:33:39	cmbsweden Yes, I guess so. A few tweets and columns, swaying the entire perception of the electorate.
JamilSmith	716571299863216128	2016-04-03T10:21:25	What isn't cool is lying like that. Black voters have been preferring Clinton. I didn't "create" that. Ease back. 
JamilSmith	716476584732069889	2016-04-03T04:05:03	Abortion opponents know that jailing women isn't a real option. So they choose instead to treat them like children. 
JamilSmith	716474024482709505	2016-04-03T03:54:53	The monumental stupidity, pathological vanity, pathetic insecurity and self-parody: I am staggered anew each time. 
JamilSmith	716380734324256768	2016-04-02T21:44:11	No. Tweet intended for Gay Talese. And you, I guess.  
JamilSmith	716462520765177857	2016-04-03T03:09:10	That's very kind of you, amharris34. Thank you for reading my work.
JamilSmith	716410129541894144	2016-04-02T23:40:59	The graveyards of the enslaved shouldn't lie forgotten under asphalt.  
JamilSmith	716413816624574464	2016-04-02T23:55:38	Trump predicted a "very massive recession," his words, in an interview with Bob Woodward and costareports. 
JamilSmith	716405466889392128	2016-04-02T23:22:28	I see why this paulkrugman post is angering Sanders supporters, but he can do all of this without capitulating. 
JamilSmith	716392296716091392	2016-04-02T22:30:08	Good to see. Intrigued to hear how it goes. 
JamilSmith	716386761920876545	2016-04-02T22:08:08	All of the commentary I published this week for MTVNews. 1.  2.  3.

JamilSmith	716332181967224835	2016-04-02T18:31:15	‚ÄùMen were razed like ripe sugar cane to his left and right.‚Äù Holy shit this essay.  
JamilSmith	716325594766712832	2016-04-02T18:05:05	If the Cleveland Indians' Chief Wahoo logo was not connected to a baseball team, it would solely be seen as racist bullshit.
JamilSmith	716323893296889857	2016-04-02T17:58:19	If you think a few mentions of racial justice issues in a Clinton or Sanders stump speech are enough, that's fine. We can politely disagree.
JamilSmith	716323256756731905	2016-04-02T17:55:47	I didn't write that candidates are utterly ignoring race. But since states got "whiter," it hasn't been as central to their argument.
JamilSmith	716323120290902017	2016-04-02T17:55:15	I'm not talking about Sanders and Clinton "bringing up race" in a speech. That's nice. I'm asking both for more. 
JamilSmith	716304291213000704	2016-04-02T16:40:25	anildash Yes! Also Electric Nick Nolte, Bana's awful performance, and the weird retconning of Hulk's origin. That movie was so bonkers.
JamilSmith	716302984053915649	2016-04-02T16:35:14	anildash Agreed. After all, I still remember paying hard currency for SPIDER-MAN 3, BATMAN AND ROBIN, and Ang Lee's HULK.
JamilSmith	716301070184673280	2016-04-02T16:27:38	The two black men at whom Baltimore cops fired 56 bullets on Thursday were father and son, and allegedly were armed. 
JamilSmith	716293657540825088	2016-04-02T15:58:10	As we revisit fraught moments like the Duke lacrosse case, I'm glad that we have reporters like scATX to guide us. 
JamilSmith	716277742615072769	2016-04-02T14:54:56	Fair minded look at the ‚Äúfossil fuel donations‚Äù campaign controversy between Clinton and Sanders. 
JamilSmith	716114597292466176	2016-04-02T04:06:39	It also helps that Wonder Woman is the only hero in the film who doesn't, to our knowledge, show an utter disregard for human life.
JamilSmith	716114311169642496	2016-04-02T04:05:31	It's welcome, but odd, that the best action hero in BATMAN V SUPERMAN is Wonder Woman. They got her right.
JamilSmith	716112588648620032	2016-04-02T03:58:40	The way ZackSnyder sets up Metropolis and Gotham City, it's as Oakland had a Batman for 20 years and somehow no one knew in San Francisco.
JamilSmith	716112096933584896	2016-04-02T03:56:43	I have so many questions about BATMAN V SUPERMAN that the filmmakers should've answered for themselves before they shot a single scene.
JamilSmith	716097411890987008	2016-04-02T02:58:22	Also, ZackSnyder: Lois is a woman AND a reporter. It isn't somehow more feminist to have her insist she's only the latter.
JamilSmith	716096937532006400	2016-04-02T02:56:29	No, BATMAN V. SUPERMAN wasn't good. It also wasn't nearly as bad as I'd been led to believe. It wish it'd been done by a better filmmaker.
JamilSmith	716025599479848960	2016-04-01T22:13:00	In fact, Wisconsin would be perfect place to talk about why black men are locked up there more than anywhere else. 
JamilSmith	716029210624729088	2016-04-01T22:27:21	We only hear race speeches from presidential hopefuls in places like Harlem. We should hear them in Wisconsin, too. 
JamilSmith	716026564262117377	2016-04-01T22:16:50	Wish that rosariodawson and I could talk on IntersectionTNR, brokeymcpoverty, but it remains on hiatus for the time being.
JamilSmith	716024853967581184	2016-04-01T22:10:02	13. I'd love to continue this conversation, rosariodawson, and I appreciate you giving me a better idea of where you were coming from.
JamilSmith	716023796373831680	2016-04-01T22:05:50	12. I hope, rosariodawson, that Sanders supporters demand a real agenda for integrating the very movement he's building. I hope he has one.
JamilSmith	716022671172116480	2016-04-01T22:01:22	11. However, rosariodawson, I have some serious doubts about how Sanders plans to use the movement he's building were he to be elected.
JamilSmith	716021907158667264	2016-04-01T21:58:20	10. Perhaps you're right, rosariodawson, and a Sanders presidency shows us that movement politics can integrate with a White House agenda.
JamilSmith	716021200707825664	2016-04-01T21:55:31	I hear you, rosariodawson, but I don't think any amount of organizing would've prevented the racism Obama faced, or the Tea Party's rise.
JamilSmith	716020803955990530	2016-04-01T21:53:57	9. I see movement politics (as BLM and others have demonstrated) flourishing outside of electoral politics, rosariodawson, since '08.
JamilSmith	716020247288025089	2016-04-01T21:51:44	8. Republicans will laugh in President Sanders's face if he tells them to look out at protesters, rosariodawson. That isn't how this works.
JamilSmith	716019635057983489	2016-04-01T21:49:18	7. It's why, rosariodawson, I find real fault with Sanders's "look out the window" construction, quoted here. 
JamilSmith	716018744712163328	2016-04-01T21:45:46	6. But again, rosariodawson, Republican obstructionism was going to be there, no matter the social-media pressure from Obama's supporters.
JamilSmith	716018259108212740	2016-04-01T21:43:50	5. As anildash is noting, rosariodawson, there were policy reasons why the Obama social outreach didn't happen. Take it for what you will.
JamilSmith	716016717294673921	2016-04-01T21:37:43	4. To me, it's less about Obama's failure to seize social-media tools to organize, rosariodawson, than it is a sign the left has grown.
JamilSmith	716016451061170176	2016-04-01T21:36:39	3. Sanders has engaged in a movement politics that may be more permanent, rosariodawson. But I give credit to the people, not the guy.
JamilSmith	716015892090523648	2016-04-01T21:34:26	2. That said, rosariodawson, I disagree entirely with your assertion that it fueled GOP obstructionism. Or that Twitter would've helped.
JamilSmith	716015316564893696	2016-04-01T21:32:09	1. Granted, Obama should‚Äôve better fueled his ‚Äô08 support into movement politics, rosariodawson. It may have strengthened his initiatives.
JamilSmith	716013169081196544	2016-04-01T21:23:37	Here, also, is audio of rosariodawson‚Äôs full quote on Obama today, also via GideonResnick. 
JamilSmith	716012846597976064	2016-04-01T21:22:20	I appreciate the response, rosariodawson. (Attaching your full quote, via GideonResnick.) We disagree somewhat.

JamilSmith	715971747481149440	2016-04-01T18:39:01	Sanders is wrong, ehussen, because his argument assumes that conservatives would share his views if media did its job better. That‚Äôs silly.
JamilSmith	715971569747558400	2016-04-01T18:38:18	Far-right resentment predates modern media, ehussen. All Fox did was give it an outlet, as Trump is doing in the 2016 race itself.
JamilSmith	715942973712805888	2016-04-01T16:44:41	Sanders laying the viability of the GOP solely at the feet of a negligent media is lazy. And it utterly mischaracterizes white resentment.

JamilSmith	715273309437489156	2016-03-30T20:23:40	Given how much the abortion debate is about black and Latina women, Trump‚Äôs remarks should be examined as a promotion of mass incarceration.
JamilSmith	715272757265752064	2016-03-30T20:21:29	Abortion opponents should reconsider the high-road reactions to Trump‚Äôs remarks. He‚Äôs suggesting a harsher version of what they‚Äôre doing.

JamilSmith	711687436452171776	2016-03-20T22:54:42	As far as explaining what Trump gives his supporters license to do, I'd say JillFilipovic expressed it best here. 
JamilSmith	711686731939053569	2016-03-20T22:51:54	I think jbouie explained best how resentment of Obama fed the rise of Trump. 
JamilSmith	711685739642281984	2016-03-20T22:47:57	It was clear that Obama derangement would require a special kind of rebuttal. Trump is that. He benefits by being a spigot for their hatred.
JamilSmith	711684601580806144	2016-03-20T22:43:26	Conservative pundits and their party didn't ignored Trump's eventual fans so much as they ignored people of color. We could've warned them.
JamilSmith	711684057252413440	2016-03-20T22:41:16	People of color watched the Obama resentment manifest physically, verbally, culturally. We saw where this was going. We'd been there before.
JamilSmith	711683250863865856	2016-03-20T22:38:04	The resentment over Obama relies upon an image of him not only as dangerous, but successful. You have to believe he actually ruined America.
JamilSmith	711682786374127616	2016-03-20T22:36:13	Republicans and conservative media didn't ignore Trump's supporters; they just assumed they'd fall in line. But post-Obama, not so much.
JamilSmith	711682035333656576	2016-03-20T22:33:14	I don't think Brooks is stupid. But he'd have to be to truly believe that not "socially intermingling" with Trump fans is the issue.
JamilSmith	711681621825605632	2016-03-20T22:31:35	Establishment Republicans, I'd venture, are worried that they'll no longer be able to benefit from the voters they've been hoodwinking.
JamilSmith	711680268579561473	2016-03-20T22:26:13	We cannot accept the public bewilderment of conservatives who helped feed the culture that now supports Trump. It's a canard.
JamilSmith	711679185593487361	2016-03-20T22:21:54	Conservatives like Brooks and NRO have fed this racial resentment because, until now, their political interests directly benefited from it.
JamilSmith	711678572084203520	2016-03-20T22:19:28	When you treat Trump more as ratings fodder than a presidential candidate, it condescends to his supporters and ignores his targets.
JamilSmith	711677751862927361	2016-03-20T22:16:13	I don't feel pundits failed to recognize the racial resentment that feeds Trump so much as they underestimated their own role in it.
JamilSmith	711676679513575424	2016-03-20T22:11:57	Journalists like David Brooks may indeed have to change the way they do their jobs, but I'm unsure if hanging with Trump supporters helps.
JamilSmith	711675682015858688	2016-03-20T22:07:59	This, from David Brooks, is compelling and humble. I'm not sure it is correct, though. 
JamilSmith	711674451407081472	2016-03-20T22:03:06	David Brooks offers an unusual moment of clarity here on Trump. It's also a cogent argument, even more rare for him.

JamilSmith	711556757303250944	2016-03-20T14:15:25	Trump is basically the Joker, folks. Desperate people turning to a man they don't fully understand, a man whose chief product is chaos.

JamilSmith	711555264449794048	2016-03-20T14:09:29	The thing that keeps coming through whenever Trump is contested in an interview is that he doesn't seem to think well on his feet, at all.

JamilSmith	711393487770525696	2016-03-20T03:26:39	"Elizabeth Warren" is not a good counter-argument when someone brings up Sanders's male privilege. She caught hell during her Senate race.

JamilSmith	711379829011181569	2016-03-20T02:32:22	Sanders wanting a nominee more liberal than Garland is to be expected. So did I. But I agree with haroldpollack: him saying so helps Obama.
JamilSmith	711376930805825536	2016-03-20T02:20:51	Sanders told maddow that, were he to be elected, he'd ask Obama to withdraw the Garland SCOTUS nomination.

JamilSmith	711324750124032000	2016-03-19T22:53:30	Trump is literally making life more dangerous for people of color in America. Yet we entertain debate over whether they'll vote for him.
JamilSmith	711324164129427456	2016-03-19T22:51:11	I did see a couple black Trump supporters in that Chicago line. He certainly appeals to the willfully ignorant, pundits and voters alike.
JamilSmith	711320424479629312	2016-03-19T22:36:19	Steve Schmidt is high if he thinks Trump, endorsed by white nationalists, has any chance appealing to black voters. 
JamilSmith	711314127541633024	2016-03-19T22:11:18	If Trump is at 49 with whites (compare to 59 for Romney) he will not be putting the rust belt in play.

JamilSmith	710511276955279360	2016-03-17T17:01:03	Seeing as the Sanders campaign hinted that they'll try to flip Clinton's pledged delegates, what POTUS said isn't all that unreasonable.

JamilSmith	710108549041557505	2016-03-16T14:20:45	The only way Garland makes sense as a Supreme Court nominee is to be a sacrificial lamb, and I suspect we'll be hearing that phrase a lot.
JamilSmith	710106281642565632	2016-03-16T14:11:45	Garland is, of course, *massively* well-respected. One of the top, if not *the* top "feeder judge" of clerks up to SCOTUS.
JamilSmith	710108452178305024	2016-03-16T14:20:22	This makes me feel significantly better about the Garland nomination. 
JamilSmith	710099680605110272	2016-03-16T13:45:31	I think there is no rationale for Garland, under Obama's judicial or political calculus or past practice‚Äîunless he got agreement from GOP.
JamilSmith	710106097445515264	2016-03-16T14:11:01	Supreme Court nominations should not be used to call the bluffs of government saboteurs. I hope that isn't what Garland is.
JamilSmith	710105467112939520	2016-03-16T14:08:31	This is disappointing. Nominating an moderate white man in his sixties to the Supreme Court is a wasted opportunity.

JamilSmith	709967119123877888	2016-03-16T04:58:46	Sanders' problem tonight is that all his talking points - momentum, only South, can't win Midwest, union voters - have been stepped on.

JamilSmith	709588348814430208	2016-03-15T03:53:40	Dishonest how, @sansorgans? You can‚Äôt seriously compare Stein‚Äôs name recognition or appeal to Sanders, who has been in Congress since ‚Äô91.
JamilSmith	709586995434102784	2016-03-15T03:48:17	Perhaps, KateHarding. But I‚Äôm not sure that I agree. Sanders‚Äôs message might resonate even more effectively were he running independently.
JamilSmith	709585513452281857	2016-03-15T03:42:24	Granted, Sanders wouldn‚Äôt be in the DNC debates. But if he were independent, had this support, and challenged Clinton, I doubt she‚Äôd say no.
JamilSmith	709584900026929152	2016-03-15T03:39:58	I don‚Äôt buy the BernieSanders argument that as an independent, he wouldn‚Äôt get media coverage. If he had this kind of support, he‚Äôd get it.

JamilSmith	708680887504936960	2016-03-12T15:47:44	This framing is wrong. Many Sanders supporters in the Chicago crowd, but I spoke to many Clinton backers, too.

JamilSmith	708468740661186560	2016-03-12T01:44:45	The crowd is gone. What is left are passionate debates between Trump supporters and opponents on the sidewalk.

JamilSmith	706988669345751040	2016-03-07T23:43:28	Hillary Clinton's pledge to remove all lead from U.S. pipes in five years is just not possible, pbump argues. 
JamilSmith	706988094197776385	2016-03-07T23:41:11	The Flint resident who asked Clinton and Sanders to promise to remove all lead service lines hated Clinton‚Äôs answer.

JamilSmith	706978878204448768	2016-03-07T23:04:34	Flint just hosted a Democratic presidential debate. I fear that's as good as it will get. Me, for MTVNews. 
JamilSmith	706977003103264768	2016-03-07T22:57:07	When your own people are leaking to the press that they want you to quit, it's over. Fine by me; Rubio is awful. 
JamilSmith	706973902992449536	2016-03-07T22:44:48	Seven female sports broadcasters discuss their safety at hotels &amp; on the road. Think you'll find it illuminating:

JamilSmith	706965098313719808	2016-03-07T22:09:48	This Bloomberg announcement is a de-facto endorsement of Hillary Clinton. 
JamilSmith	706965159949033472	2016-03-07T22:10:03	Bloomberg won't run because he fears Trump would win. Could've saved us the time. We knew that on the first day. 
JamilSmith	706957320534761473	2016-03-07T21:38:54	I had to stop at ‚Äú50 lashes.‚Äù I‚Äôm surprised, given that it‚Äôs D‚ÄôSouza, I made it that far.

JamilSmith	706932747173027841	2016-03-07T20:01:15	Then, why not just say ‚Äúpoorer African American communities‚Äù rather than ‚Äúghettos‚Äù? 
JamilSmith	706926519491411968	2016-03-07T19:36:30	Today is the 51st anniversary of "Bloody Sunday." AmyKNelson, from last year, on a special Selma reunion. 
JamilSmith	706916116514390016	2016-03-07T18:55:10	I don't want to spend too much time on that Sanders SELMA tweet. They either need more people, or to listen to those they have. The end.
JamilSmith	706912753945059329	2016-03-07T18:41:49	Here is that since-deleted BernieSanders "Bloody Sunday" tweet, complete with image from the film SELMA. 
JamilSmith	706910141149536256	2016-03-07T18:31:26	This is a screenshot from the movie SELMA. And not from the "Bloody Sunday" part.

JamilSmith	706692840869462016	2016-03-07T04:07:57	Hillary Clinton may soon be the first woman to be nominated for president. She‚Äôll run against sexism incarnate. 
JamilSmith	706689599347826693	2016-03-07T03:55:04	Women in clinic-scarce states are Googling instructions on how to do abortions at home, but no questions tonight. 
JamilSmith	706679024148418560	2016-03-07T03:13:03	Secondly, Clinton and Sanders agree on a lot of issues. Debate educates voters about their stances, and strengthens them. Why not abortion?
JamilSmith	706678359586119680	2016-03-07T03:10:25	First, you allow Republicans to control the narrative on reproductive rights when your party is afraid to discuss it at length in a debate.
JamilSmith	706678127041323008	2016-03-07T03:09:29	It shouldn't bear repeating, but evidently it does. It doesn't matter if Clinton and Sanders agree on abortion. It should still come up.
JamilSmith	706677157381197824	2016-03-07T03:05:38	Given how the Democratic debates have ignored abortion, this is one time where I wouldn‚Äôt have minded a mention of reproductive organs.
JamilSmith	706676067071868928	2016-03-07T03:01:18	Precisely. 
JamilSmith	706675371954061312	2016-03-07T02:58:32	We saw each candidate asked about God and prayer. We've yet to hear them asked about abortion with a Supreme Court case pending.
JamilSmith	706674857724014592	2016-03-07T02:56:30	Very strong answer from Sanders on his Jewish heritage.
JamilSmith	706674706284486658	2016-03-07T02:55:54	How Bernie Sanders's Jewish background plays into his race for president:  DemDebate 
JamilSmith	706674516995547140	2016-03-07T02:55:08	3 tweets that show the problem with Bernie Sanders's line on white peoples and ghettos:  
JamilSmith	706674315731738624	2016-03-07T02:54:20	"Do you believe that God is relevant?" a woman asks Sanders. He basically quotes the Golden Rule and moves on, as he should.
JamilSmith	706673929880928256	2016-03-07T02:52:48	Props to CNN for making sure there's a good racial balance of people who got to ask questions at the DemDebate. It's reflective of Flint.
JamilSmith	706673919907012608	2016-03-07T02:52:46	Both candidates were just prompted to attack Trump; Sanders still gets in a dig on Clinton. Focus on the problem. 
JamilSmith	706673434365960192	2016-03-07T02:50:50	There's things about both candidates I don't like. I'll be voting for whoever the Democrats nominate. Principles don't supercede lives.
JamilSmith	706671019201851392	2016-03-07T02:41:14	That fracking answer sums up Clinton v. Sanders. (I suspect supporters of both would say answers like that are why they support each.)
JamilSmith	706670721095835650	2016-03-07T02:40:03	No, Nerdista: I appreciate Clinton giving a detailed answer. I just wish "no" would suffice for everyone; fracking is incredibly harmful.
JamilSmith	706670204764475392	2016-03-07T02:38:00	"Do you support fracking?" a University of Michigan student asks Clinton. She gives a detailed answer, when I wish "no" would just suffice.
JamilSmith	706669470274580480	2016-03-07T02:35:05	I appreciate that Hillary offers more specifics. Sanders ideas are more audacious and exciting but unclear.
JamilSmith	706669407532097536	2016-03-07T02:34:50	America's crumbling infrastructure is a real crisis:  DemDebate 
JamilSmith	706669405971869696	2016-03-07T02:34:50	Yes! It's part of my frustration about the primary‚Äîthe most meaningful differences aren't legislative. 
JamilSmith	706669301672103937	2016-03-07T02:34:25	Sanders talks about free college. One problem w/ this is crumbling public ed makes lots of kids unprepared, even if it's free. DemDebate
JamilSmith	706669035468021761	2016-03-07T02:33:21	Sanders is incapable of talking about education for children. His answer to teacher question is about free college tuition. Wow.
JamilSmith	706668830102257664	2016-03-07T02:32:33	Cooper challenges Clinton on the support she‚Äôs getting from teachers‚Äô unions. Rebukes any scapegoating of them, as she should.
JamilSmith	706668722468032512	2016-03-07T02:32:07	Talking about Detroit schools without talking about how SCOTUS made it impossible to integrate, means you're not real about fixing.
JamilSmith	706668561415213056	2016-03-07T02:31:28	Can‚Äôt believe this is the first that Michigan‚Äôs emergency management system came up. Hugely undemocratic. 
JamilSmith	706668287820750849	2016-03-07T02:30:23	Answering the Detroit mother‚Äôs question about schools, Clinton cuts right to a three-point solution. Criticizes MI‚Äôs ‚Äúemergency managers.‚Äù
JamilSmith	706667726417305604	2016-03-07T02:28:09	This is key: In this debate and going forward, Clinton and Sanders have to make Republicans accountable, not just each other.
JamilSmith	706667524558032897	2016-03-07T02:27:21	Sanders says "we should be ashamed" of how we treat our kids and senior citizens. Notes GOP can't come up for money to fix school system.
JamilSmith	706667356945252352	2016-03-07T02:26:41	A mother asks the decrepit state of Detroit's public schools. Sanders applauds her for fighting for change; very good.
JamilSmith	706666104937193472	2016-03-07T02:21:43	Both Clinton and Sanders tonight challenged white people to have empathy for people of color. Me, on why that's key. 
JamilSmith	706665486268960768	2016-03-07T02:19:15	Here are all the ways that welfare reform has been a huge disaster: 
JamilSmith	706665022882254849	2016-03-07T02:17:25	Clinton asked about the "super predators" comment. She basically says what she told CapehartJ. Then pivots back to Flint's lead poisoning.
JamilSmith	706664661119344641	2016-03-07T02:15:59	Did you just ask a debate question that prompts a candidate to give a stump speech? You asked a bad question, then.
JamilSmith	706664346995322880	2016-03-07T02:14:44	The struggle Don Lemon is having here with these race questions shows why we need folks like MHarrisPerry on cable news. Nothing to add.
JamilSmith	706663374143299585	2016-03-07T02:10:52	Don Lemon is basing a presidential debate question on a quote from "Avenue Q."
JamilSmith	706662992113438720	2016-03-07T02:09:21	Don Lemon asking someone "what racial blind spots do you have?" is funny.
JamilSmith	706662608972087296	2016-03-07T02:07:49	Exactly. And pushed for in black communities too. Mass delusion led to mass incarceration.  
JamilSmith	706661373275725824	2016-03-07T02:02:55	Always odd to see reporters act like mass incarceration began with 94 Crime Bill. Started far earlier, in the states, both parties pushed it
JamilSmith	706662380131000320	2016-03-07T02:06:55	Brother from Flint asks Sanders what has helped him understand other cultures. Sanders goes back to his civil rights work.
JamilSmith	706662183476789248	2016-03-07T02:06:08	That was one hell of a promise he just made. 
JamilSmith	706662106477764609	2016-03-07T02:05:49	Sanders is 100 percent right: no candidate platform on ending structural racism is complete without a death penalty moratorium.
JamilSmith	706661916136095744	2016-03-07T02:05:04	I knew Don Lemon wasn't gonna get outta this without saying some nonsense. That "one in three" stat is basura. 
JamilSmith	706661869789061120	2016-03-07T02:04:53	Bernie onto a loser w/guns. Once he launched a national campaign, he should have adopted tougher line--smart politics + right thing to do.
JamilSmith	706661687793946624	2016-03-07T02:04:10	The more precise Q is which prison policies are you going to change?  3 strikes  jail for low level drug use  over criminalization  solitary
JamilSmith	706661489243873281	2016-03-07T02:03:22	They're letting Don Lemon ask things about black people.   Oh.
JamilSmith	706661319966113793	2016-03-07T02:02:42	Does Hillary Clinton "get it" on issues of identity? DemDebate  
JamilSmith	706661112150892545	2016-03-07T02:01:52	Don Lemon asks about mass incarceration and the 1994 crime bill. Clinton immediately notes that she and Sanders supported it.
JamilSmith	706660745669427200	2016-03-07T02:00:25	Clinton asks an audience in Flint to sympathize with the Sandy Hook families. And it ends in the night's biggest applause. Interesting.
JamilSmith	706660380798488577	2016-03-07T01:58:58	Clinton getting to a crucial point here-- accountability incentivizes gun manufacturers to make their guns safer
JamilSmith	706660311739166720	2016-03-07T01:58:42	Blaming mental illness for mass shootings? That's a page straight out of the NRA's playbook.
JamilSmith	706660262602891264	2016-03-07T01:58:30	I worked in the Senate at the time: Dems who supported gun manufacturer liability protection did so because the NRA pressured them to do so
JamilSmith	706660057677701120	2016-03-07T01:57:41	By alluding to the Charleston loophole without noting his opposition, Clinton got Cooper to do her work. 
JamilSmith	706659554604535809	2016-03-07T01:55:41	He left the intersectionality of his jobs and trade critique at home, though. 
JamilSmith	706659354909548545	2016-03-07T01:54:53	This, üíØ. Detroit's economic problems are the consequences of decades of housing segregation/discrimination.  
JamilSmith	706659024222220288	2016-03-07T01:53:35	Did Hillary just SIP TEA during Bernie's answer on guns?   Tea level: expert.
JamilSmith	706658646239879168	2016-03-07T01:52:05	Really excellent question about gun violence in DemDebate. "Mental health screenings" don't cover culture of toxic masculinity.
JamilSmith	706658671779045377	2016-03-07T01:52:11	Clinton notes the Brady Bill's effectiveness, closing the Charleston loophole -- both of which Sanders voted against.
JamilSmith	706658426500173824	2016-03-07T01:51:12	Father of Kalamazoo shooting victim at the debate: "She's now laughing and giggling but she has a long road‚Äù ahead 
JamilSmith	706658372863574016	2016-03-07T01:50:59	Crime is now the topic. Father of a Kalamazoo girl shot asks about the gun epidemic. Doesn't want to hear anything about mental illness.
JamilSmith	706656957759778817	2016-03-07T01:45:22	Talk about decline of manufacturing, sure, but talk also about white flight, growth of suburbs, post-riots flight, etc. Multifactor decline.
JamilSmith	706656801803145216	2016-03-07T01:44:45	This needs to be addressed at tonight's DemDebate 
JamilSmith	706657207555919872	2016-03-07T01:46:21	Black children are at twice the risk of lead exposure as white children:   
JamilSmith	706657199255212032	2016-03-07T01:46:20	Detroit's "white population has fallen 95% between the 1950 and 2010 censuses." That's not just about auto jobs. 
JamilSmith	706657125188108288	2016-03-07T01:46:02	Sanders has the most scarily simplistic understanding of economics. If anything benefits a corporation - even to create jobs - he's opposed
JamilSmith	706656579932782592	2016-03-07T01:43:52	This. And brentNYT reminded me of this NYT editorial about housing apartheid in America.  
JamilSmith	706655963953156096	2016-03-07T01:41:25	I hadn‚Äôt previously heard Clinton hit Sanders that hard for not voting for the auto bailout; he gave her that opening.
JamilSmith	706655518073462784	2016-03-07T01:39:39	This debate had a promising start, but Flint has gotten lost.
JamilSmith	706654940765233152	2016-03-07T01:37:21	You can‚Äôt just blame trade or corporate America for Flint‚Äôs economic downfall. Here‚Äôs the full story: 
JamilSmith	706654823324786688	2016-03-07T01:36:53	I would pay real money for BernieSanders to talk about white flight from Detroit and cities like it.
JamilSmith	706654623512264704	2016-03-07T01:36:05	Cooper asks about that terrible BernieSanders tweet earlier this week implying Clinton is responsible for Detroit's urban decay. He dodges.
JamilSmith	706654347128602629	2016-03-07T01:35:00	I wonder how many Flint residents care at all about Clinton's Wall Street speeches. They may; who knows? But I have my doubts.
JamilSmith	706654043045818369	2016-03-07T01:33:47	This question began on trade deals. It ended up on the auto bailout. Which Obama did. And people love it. People love him.
JamilSmith	706653573145305088	2016-03-07T01:31:55	"While we're on Wall Street..." Sanders said. Nothing to add.
JamilSmith	706653376390545410	2016-03-07T01:31:08	There is a policy and intellectual argument against the bailout -- but it's not widely supported in MI, (or by leadership in either party).
JamilSmith	706653372305313792	2016-03-07T01:31:07	Sanders had a different approach for the auto industry recovery. But is it actually realistic? Perhaps, perhaps not. Seems worth examining.
JamilSmith	706652994788573185	2016-03-07T01:29:37	"If you're going to talk, tell the whole story." Effective parry of a bad look for Sanders.
JamilSmith	706652502746390528	2016-03-07T01:27:40	EXCUSE ME I'M TALKING  What.
JamilSmith	706652310433361920	2016-03-07T01:26:54	Clinton parries Sanders's NAFTA/TPP attack by noting that he opposed the auto bailout. He counters by calling it the "Wall Street bailout."
JamilSmith	706651927363383296	2016-03-07T01:25:23	Sanders: "I am very glad that Secretary Clinton has discovered religion on this issue, but it's too little too late." Here we go.
JamilSmith	706651386042322944	2016-03-07T01:23:14	Fourth Flint resident asks about Flint's auto industry, and what they'll do to keep businesses from leaving our cities.
JamilSmith	706650892490153984	2016-03-07T01:21:16	In Flint, CNN has figured out how to combine the best parts of a debate with the terrific town halls we've seen during the campaign.
JamilSmith	706650293258297344	2016-03-07T01:18:53	Flint Journal editor: "Why should the people of Flint believe that you aren't just using this crisis to score political points?"
JamilSmith	706650084637810688	2016-03-07T01:18:03	Don Lemon: "Do you think people should go to jail?" Waste of a question. Both Clinton and Sanders say they want accountability.
JamilSmith	706649754764185600	2016-03-07T01:16:45	Second Flint resident asks for promise to replace all lead in water systems. Both candidates do. Clinton mentions water, soil, and paint.
JamilSmith	706649293017448448	2016-03-07T01:14:55	Sanders keeps asking variations on ‚Äúhow did this happen?‚Äù Flint gets why it happened.
JamilSmith	706648810777407492	2016-03-07T01:13:00	‚ÄúYes, people should be fired,‚Äù Clinton tells Cooper when asked about the EPA‚Äôs failings in Flint. Mentions Cleveland‚Äôs high lead levels.
JamilSmith	706648401904078848	2016-03-07T01:11:22	Asked why government should be trusted to fix Flint, Sanders says it‚Äôs more trustworthy than corporate America or Wall Street.
JamilSmith	706647993924067328	2016-03-07T01:09:45	Sanders is right: Flint residents paid the highest rates in the country while their water was poisoned

JamilSmith	705464044111712257	2016-03-03T18:45:09	25 years after Rodney King, are we numb to videos of police violence? Me, in newrepublic:  
JamilSmith	705459994704089088	2016-03-03T18:29:04	Rodney King was beaten 25 years ago today. mikafrak, on whether we're we numb to videos of police violence. 
JamilSmith	705457095932510212	2016-03-03T18:17:33	What we need now from Bernie Sanders, from JamilSmith for MTVNews:  
JamilSmith	705450443846107136	2016-03-03T17:51:07	First step for GOP establishment is admitting their own role in starting this dumpster fire, rather than acting like they've been invaded.
JamilSmith	705450127998230528	2016-03-03T17:49:51	Romney speech would have been more effective (on its own terms!) if Romney had expressed regret &amp; apology for campaigning with Trump in '12.
JamilSmith	705449513746567169	2016-03-03T17:47:25	Also: "We don't divide" by race or gender. Yikes. 
JamilSmith	705448689586798592	2016-03-03T17:44:08	prof_carrington Because Bernie won Oklahoma. I guess it was only Clinton's "red" state primary wins that didn't count for Jane Sanders.
JamilSmith	705447961153703936	2016-03-03T17:41:15	The most stupefying claim Jane Sanders made on allinwithchris is that the Obama coalition is so 2008, when it's partly what's beating them.
JamilSmith	705447871101968384	2016-03-03T17:40:53	When Democrats dismiss primary wins in "red" states, those voters get erased. A curious argument for Jane Sanders to make, because Oklahoma.
JamilSmith	705444131624067072	2016-03-03T17:26:02	It astounds me how the Sanders folks continue to think their deficit with black voters stems from a lack of familiarity with his policies.
JamilSmith	705441629914734592	2016-03-03T17:16:05	Jane Sanders, on allinwithchris, repeated the familiar line about African American voters not being ‚Äúall that familiar with Bernie.‚Äù
JamilSmith	705441402541514760	2016-03-03T17:15:11	Here‚Äôs the Jane Sanders interview from last night‚Äôs allinwithchris. There‚Äôs a lot here to unpack. 
JamilSmith	705439793665220608	2016-03-03T17:08:47	Did someone say brokered convention? Oh, that'd be me. 
JamilSmith	705437692746735619	2016-03-03T17:00:27	Romney just showed why Democrats shouldn't wait for the GOP to take Trump down. Me, on why Sanders should help. 
JamilSmith	705435256904663040	2016-03-03T16:50:46	Mitt Romney‚Äôs Trump analysis would have been somewhat meaningful if it offered even the slightest introspection about the GOP. Alas.
JamilSmith	705433571788455936	2016-03-03T16:44:04	I missed the allinwithchris interview last night with Jane Sanders. I hear not so great things. Is there video? MSNBC didn‚Äôt post it.
JamilSmith	705431483939422208	2016-03-03T16:35:46	If you‚Äôd like, you can watch MittRomney‚Äôs speech about 2016 here. He‚Äôs speaking now.

JamilSmith	705380327422824453	2016-03-03T13:12:30	You know, I think a lot of folks actually let themselves to forget what a charlatan MittRomney is. It seems they'll get a reminder today.
JamilSmith	705379612696649728	2016-03-03T13:09:39	Yet another New Jersey newspaper calls for GovChristie to resign. That makes seven, I believe. nypost, thoughts? 
JamilSmith	705378062142148608	2016-03-03T13:03:29	I have much more to say about MHPshow's end. I've given some as-yet unpublished media quotes, but I'm also writing. nerdland, forever.
JamilSmith	705376100529086464	2016-03-03T12:55:42	I was a P.A. on Connie Chung's successful CNN show in 2003 when the Iraq War began, and suddenly she was doing news updates. No more show.
JamilSmith	705375551465385985	2016-03-03T12:53:31	Also, let's not act like cable news shows aren't simply "disappeared," as Melissa said. It happened to the first show I ever worked on.
JamilSmith	705375114335023105	2016-03-03T12:51:47	The seeds were planted, so to speak, for MHPshow's demise before I left MSNBC more than a year ago. This isn't some sudden reaction.
JamilSmith	705373587880984576	2016-03-03T12:45:43	The reaction to MHPshow's end that pisses me off the most is MSNBC brass acting surprised. I was there. Melissa isn't inventing this.
JamilSmith	705372826685997056	2016-03-03T12:42:41	"We didn't deserve to be disappeared," said MHarrisPerry about MHPshow. "It was evil, and it was cruel."  nerdland

JamilSmith	705371240001830913	2016-03-03T12:36:23	The GOP establishment's greatest trick? Getting away with telling America that they are more righteous than this monster they've created.
JamilSmith	705369012780339200	2016-03-03T12:27:32	Unless MittRomney's speech contains the words, "I'm launching an independent campaign for president," what difference does it really make?
JamilSmith	705214275938344960	2016-03-03T02:12:40	Folks, if someone is part of a community &amp; you aren't, &amp; explains why your candidate didn't connect w/ them, you should probably listen.
JamilSmith	705140854361604096	2016-03-02T21:20:55	while it's still a steep uphill battle, it's worth noting that officers were almost never brought up on murder charges nationwide before BLM
JamilSmith	705207646849261569	2016-03-03T01:46:19	There are three reasons BernieSanders is staying in the race, reports EvanMcSan. Who is calling for him to quit?

JamilSmith	705196123623858176	2016-03-03T01:00:32	The best thing BernieSanders can do after SuperTuesday? Join HillaryClinton in attacking Trump. Me, for MTVNews. 
JamilSmith	705179740601188357	2016-03-02T23:55:26	Bernie Sanders Needs A New Argument:  
JamilSmith	705170137800806401	2016-03-02T23:17:16	He probably won't defeat HillaryClinton. But the way BernieSanders keeps fighting will matter. Me, for MTVNews.

JamilSmith	705168528245133316	2016-03-02T23:10:53	Texas's abortion restrictions are transparently dishonest. Will the Supreme Court admit it?  
JamilSmith	705168305137586176	2016-03-02T23:09:59	‚ÄúThe Oscars controversy was a wake-up call,‚Äù said J.J. Abrams, speaking about Bad Robot‚Äôs new diversity policy.

JamilSmith	705091681658343424	2016-03-02T18:05:31	I was moved by the ShaunKing story. I even RT'd it. Then I dug deeper and found how wildly irresponsible it was.

JamilSmith	705119707519700992	2016-03-02T19:56:53	Racism is never dependent upon intent. But we‚Äôll see guys like Jeffrey Lord trying to insist the opposite to excuse their Trump support.
JamilSmith	705118705110355969	2016-03-02T19:52:54	What will be fascinating about a Trump candidacy, actually, is that we‚Äôll have to dig into the question of intent with regards to racism.
JamilSmith	705117823857790976	2016-03-02T19:49:24	We‚Äôre about to have a general election in which we‚Äôll have to question whether a Trump backer on the air is also a KKK apologist. Fun times.
JamilSmith	705116108244684800	2016-03-02T19:42:35	I'm glad JohnAvlon stood up to Trump backer Jeffrey Lord's bullshit, but CNN should stop putting Lord on the air. 
JamilSmith	705115347108634624	2016-03-02T19:39:33	Smart brianbeutler piece makes the case that Democrats shouldn't save the GOP from the coming Trump reckoning. 
JamilSmith	705115576851697665	2016-03-02T19:40:28	These conservative PACs are essentially working for Hillary Clinton now with these Trump attacks. It‚Äôs too late. 
JamilSmith	705115099988631553	2016-03-02T19:38:34	Had the same thought. It‚Äôs incredible to me how, at this point, Republicans refuse to understand Trump‚Äôs appeal.

JamilSmith	704887657407639552	2016-03-02T04:34:48	I think this is exactly right. To beat Trump you have to undermine the myth he tells about himself. 
JamilSmith	705035613569945600	2016-03-02T14:22:43	Trump's campaign hinges on the support of White nationalist angst, xenophobia, and anti-Arab Racism. He welcomes it. That's racist.
JamilSmith	705035420527153152	2016-03-02T14:21:57	I do not share the "Trump Is Not a Racist" idea. Enabling or being indifferent to racism is itself an act of racism.

JamilSmith	704148509637767168	2016-02-29T03:37:41	Chris Rock‚Äôs Oscars monologue was kind of like listening to a Macklemore album  
JamilSmith	704148052643356672	2016-02-29T03:35:52	I guess Stallone lost? I'll say this: I loved Creed, and it was brave &amp; surprising he let Coogler &amp; Jordan reimagine his signature work.

JamilSmith	704146375303434241	2016-02-29T03:29:12	Here's JamilSmith on why Flint was the place to be on Oscars night.  
JamilSmith	704146073284165632	2016-02-29T03:28:00	Here's JamilSmith on what is happening in Flint tonight. 
JamilSmith	704145720559931392	2016-02-29T03:26:36	JusticeForFlint isn't over, but here are my early thoughts on why Flint was the place to be on Oscars night. 
JamilSmith	704144780763201537	2016-02-29T03:22:52	.ira thought Chris Rock's Oscars monologue was funny, but ultimately missed the point.  
JamilSmith	704143567418224640	2016-02-29T03:18:03	Are the Oscars just not your thing? How to watch Justice for Flint  
JamilSmith	704142416593461248	2016-02-29T03:13:29	Stevie Wonder just showed up at JusticeForFlint, y‚Äôall. Watch it now. 
JamilSmith	704137172165771264	2016-02-29T02:52:38	Here‚Äôs what that Stacey Dash joke at the Oscars was all about:  
JamilSmith	704137183679143936	2016-02-29T02:52:41	kinda disappointing whenever a mad max person looks normal
JamilSmith	704136453832339456	2016-02-29T02:49:47	Biggest disappointment is that most of the diversity comedy has focused on black inclusion, when the issue is much larger. Oscars
JamilSmith	704135934107914241	2016-02-29T02:47:43	Just a very quick take on Chris Rock's opening monologue:  Oscars
JamilSmith	704133033000083457	2016-02-29T02:36:11	‚ÄúShoulda-been nominee Michael B. Jordan.‚Äù Word. Oscars
JamilSmith	704132367233974272	2016-02-29T02:33:33	Watching the Oscars and need a dose of blackness? JanelleMonae is performing at JusticeForFlint right now. 
JamilSmith	704130445672390656	2016-02-29T02:25:55	I loved SPOTLIGHT. Enjoyed THE MARTIAN. Was riveted by STEVE JOBS. Blown away by FURY ROAD. Fell asleep during THE REVENANT. Oscars
JamilSmith	704125621547483137	2016-02-29T02:06:44	People, you don‚Äôt need me to explain that joke. You, too, can Google ‚ÄúStacey Dash‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlack History Month.‚Äù I believe in you. Oscars
JamilSmith	704125018268164099	2016-02-29T02:04:21	That Stacey Dash moment might be the first time an Oscars telecast has aired a BlackTwitter inside joke.
JamilSmith	704120884580241409	2016-02-29T01:47:55	Chris Rock‚Äôs monologue was, I‚Äôd venture, uncomfortable for most of us to watch. And perhaps that was the point. Oscars
JamilSmith	704119767511265280	2016-02-29T01:43:29	"We want opportunity. We want the black actors to get the same opportunities as white actors." -ChrisRock Oscars

JamilSmith	704116316010110976	2016-02-29T01:29:46	I hate awards shows, but I‚Äôve always wanted to go to the Oscars. We all contain contradictions, I guess.
JamilSmith	704113410519252992	2016-02-29T01:18:13	Folks, the Best Picture Oscar has been meaningless since they gave it to CRASH. This year is no different.  Oscars
JamilSmith	704110429568565248	2016-02-29T01:06:22	I'm assuming Hollywood is working on a JusticeForFlint movie starring Jennifer Lawrence &amp; Bradley Cooper. BEST PICTURE NOMINEE 2017 Oscars
JamilSmith	704111326696763393	2016-02-29T01:09:56	Good to know. 
JamilSmith	704110837246480384	2016-02-29T01:08:00	Inquiring minds, indeed. 
JamilSmith	704109208241889282	2016-02-29T01:01:31	Also, love the 'it's bigger' than the Oscars hot takes. As if POC, activists are misinformed, narrow-minded. (smh) 
JamilSmith	704108312439218178	2016-02-29T00:57:58	Those who complain that OscarsSoWhite focuses only on black performers know they‚Äôre mistaken, yes? No? Oh, okay.

JamilSmith	704063337752076289	2016-02-28T21:59:15	It was OK when Trump demanded ID from the president and called Mexicans rapists and tweeted fake stats about black crime but now...
JamilSmith	704041307497480194	2016-02-28T20:31:42	That's an honest question. I haven't seen any state polling of black voters indicating that Sanders is strong with black voters anywhere.
JamilSmith	704040708462780416	2016-02-28T20:29:19	Sanders argues he'll do better with black voters who don't live in the Deep South. Does any polling bear that out? 
JamilSmith	704038004852137984	2016-02-28T20:18:35	Indeed, @ADrunkRussian1. People are free to embrace white supremacy, and to fly a flag that embodies that idea. You can still condemn both.
JamilSmith	704037596972912640	2016-02-28T20:16:58	If the people who I followed upon joining Twitter valued what I said based upon my follower count, jonathansword, I wouldn't be where I am.
JamilSmith	704036230640574464	2016-02-28T20:11:32	I try not to check a person's follower count to determine whether his or her argument or statement is worth engaging, jonathansword.
JamilSmith	704035695493566464	2016-02-28T20:09:24	I'm going to need those Republicans who rightfully condemned Trump and the KKK to reject the Confederate flag, too. 
JamilSmith	704028057992990720	2016-02-28T19:39:03	Great way to entice black voters. 
JamilSmith	704026953590902784	2016-02-28T19:34:40	Hillary Clinton stayed on the ‚Äúlove and kindness‚Äù train today at two Memphis churches, per danmericaCNN.

JamilSmith	704019737215422464	2016-02-28T19:06:00	‚ÄúWe cannot be a party that nominates someone who refuses to condemn white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan,‚Äù marcorubio said. Good on him.
JamilSmith	704018786979028992	2016-02-28T19:02:13	Appreciate that, NoahCRothman. I admitted my mistake, deleted the tweet, and posted the Cruz and Rubio repudiations.
JamilSmith	704018283893276672	2016-02-28T19:00:13	Marco Rubio on Trump‚Äôs CNN interview: ‚ÄúHe knows exactly who David Duke is.‚Äù 
JamilSmith	704017742249238528	2016-02-28T18:58:04	Hours before Trump dodged the David Duke question, there was a KKK rally in Anaheim where three people were stabbed. 
JamilSmith	704017379550953472	2016-02-28T18:56:37	I stand corrected. But I‚Äôm going to need more from marcorubio and tedcruz on this Trump/KKK business than tweets. 
JamilSmith	704016861051150338	2016-02-28T18:54:34	When it comes to associations with racists, you‚Äôve seen GOP careers ruined over less than what Trump did this morning. Trent Lott, for one.
JamilSmith	704015464654098432	2016-02-28T18:49:01	The full Trump interview on CNN today, in which he acted like he‚Äôd never heard of David Duke or white supremacists. 
JamilSmith	703992665159946241	2016-02-28T17:18:25	I have much more to say about MHPshow‚Äôs end, and MSNBC‚Äôs role in it. I may be writing something about it once I can gather my thoughts.
JamilSmith	703992337169522688	2016-02-28T17:17:07	As MHPshow ends, we have a responsibility to continue amplifying the voices nerdland spotlighted. As she‚Äôd say, the struggle continues.
JamilSmith	703990776318001152	2016-02-28T17:10:55	I am sad not just for the end of MHPshow. The outlet that introduced MSNBC viewers to so many previously unknown voices is gone. nerdland
JamilSmith	703990208837115907	2016-02-28T17:08:39	"Nerdland" was a word MHarrisPerry said in an interview. I then hashtagged it on Twitter. You see what it became: a community, an identity.
JamilSmith	703914240567066624	2016-02-28T12:06:47	Farewell Nerdland. Inviting diverse new voices to table was a privilege. Grateful for years of support &amp; criticism. 
JamilSmith	703988939087020033	2016-02-28T17:03:37	I was one of the first two people MHarrisPerry hired as an MHPshow staffer. The end of this show is a loss I'm still trying to absorb.
JamilSmith	703988572261621760	2016-02-28T17:02:09	Here, again, is MHarrisPerry's full letter to her MHPshow staff regarding her decision not to host.  nerdland
JamilSmith	703987581134966784	2016-02-28T16:58:13	Amazing Trump again pretends to know nothing about David Duke, who he denounced in 2000: 
JamilSmith	703957608609091584	2016-02-28T14:59:07	This week on TalkPoverty Radio: talking OscarsSoWhite w/ JamilSmith of MTVNews   Tune in now: 
JamilSmith	703806448715886593	2016-02-28T04:58:28	You want to deal with racism, prejudice, and our intersectionality deficit? Or do you want to worry about who gets called a "racist"?
JamilSmith	703805437905399808	2016-02-28T04:54:27	This, also, was a bad look. All candidates need to get better on race. We can't be afraid to talk about that. 
JamilSmith	703804151952703488	2016-02-28T04:49:20	The Sanders ‚Äútoo smart‚Äù bit, especially after the SC loss, was a bad look. But folks, if I wanted to call him ‚Äúracist,‚Äù I‚Äôd have done that.
JamilSmith	703792155647713280	2016-02-28T04:01:40	This just isn't smart. 
JamilSmith	703788434154983425	2016-02-28T03:46:53	Sanders told a mostly white crowd that they're "too smart" not to vote for him on the same night he lost a heavily black state by 48 points.
JamilSmith	703786144735965184	2016-02-28T03:37:47	If you've heard Bernie supporters' rhetoric, "There's no way we're going to lose Minnesota. You are just too smart" not a surprise
JamilSmith	703780661098913792	2016-02-28T03:15:59	Never said Sanders doesn't care about black voters, lplzydeco. That said, whoever is writing his speeches isn't helping in that regard.
JamilSmith	703778685363593216	2016-02-28T03:08:08	After losing a state with a heavily black electorate by nearly 50 points, Sanders hardly reached out to black voters in his speech. Odd.
JamilSmith	703776654380945408	2016-02-28T03:00:04	The MSNBC plan? Sever ties with MHarrisPerry and possibly jdbalart; possibly extend "Morning Joe." We see y'all. 
JamilSmith	703773739184431104	2016-02-28T02:48:29	I'm glad BernieSanders criticized Republicans on voting rights tonight. I'm curious why he hasn't made it a staple. 
JamilSmith	703756267538550784	2016-02-28T01:39:03	Clinton won black support by a larger margin in South Carolina than Obama did in 2008. mattyglesias, on that.

JamilSmith	703750124858695680	2016-02-28T01:14:39	The "love and kindness" line HillaryClinton used tonight isn't just a line. Read this rubycramer profile. 
JamilSmith	703748588975857664	2016-02-28T01:08:33	The white candidate's burden? Don't just talk to black people about race. Engage white folks, too. Me, for MTVNews. 
JamilSmith	703747306001199104	2016-02-28T01:03:27	Listen to the language Clinton is using tonight about racial inequality. She isn't just talking to black people.

JamilSmith	703742948660420608	2016-02-28T00:46:08	Important lesson Clinton learned from Obama 2008 is chill.  IA happened. NH happened. She didn't freak out, executed her plan, &amp; it worked.
JamilSmith	703742064303935489	2016-02-28T00:42:37	I hope it was worth it, GovChristie. 
JamilSmith	703741506973257728	2016-02-28T00:40:24	Exactly, HeerJeet. You can't argue to lead a "political revolution" when your campaign behaves as if it can only win in the whitest states.
JamilSmith	703739893013467136	2016-02-28T00:34:00	I disagree, HeerJeet. Obama did that already succeeded in assembling that Jackson coalition in '08. Sanders is failing to reconstitute it.

JamilSmith	701893654739361792	2016-02-22T22:17:42	I actually did ask about accountability, ZaidJilani. I want candidates to hold white people accountable for their role in addressing race.
JamilSmith	701892764645117952	2016-02-22T22:14:10	That said, Ryschlee, Clinton didn't fully answer my question. I asked how she'll be engaging white voters, not whether she'll be doing so.
JamilSmith	701891289093169156	2016-02-22T22:08:18	I want more concrete plans for both candidates on racial justice, Ryschlee, but a commitment to engage white people on the issue matters.

JamilSmith	701530712567058434	2016-02-21T22:15:30	Apart from this from Bernie's policy director last week, was there any prior word re: $30B for private HBCUs/MSIs?

JamilSmith	701437144921985024	2016-02-21T16:03:42	Excellent job with that BET Black Votes Matter special, marclamonthill and Jeffsnation.
JamilSmith	701436568960163840	2016-02-21T16:01:24	Clinton asked about reparations by Jeffsnation. She advocates gov't investment in communities of color, doesn't give an outright denial.
JamilSmith	701435899905777668	2016-02-21T15:58:45	When Jeffsnation asks how she'll address the concerns of black women, Clinton discusses health care, equal pay as part of her agenda.

JamilSmith	701434631019765761	2016-02-21T15:53:42	After Clinton argued that Sanders gets a pass on his crime bill vote, Jeffsnation had a great counter: essentially, it isn't about you two.
JamilSmith	701434071314882560	2016-02-21T15:51:29	First Jeffsnation question to Clinton is about the '94 crime bill. She explains why she supported it, and laments its effects.

JamilSmith	701431514450542592	2016-02-21T15:41:19	Sanders, pressed by marclamonthill about his opposition to reparations, dodges. "It's a longer story than we have time to get into now."
JamilSmith	701430386203688960	2016-02-21T15:36:50	Sanders had a strong answer to marclamonthill on why he opposed Bill Clinton's welfare reform. Doesn't mention his vote on 1994 crime bill.
JamilSmith	701429829359562752	2016-02-21T15:34:37	When marclamonthill asked for an agenda to address black poverty, Sanders listed a bunch of stats. Eventually mentioned jobs and education.

JamilSmith	700060746714062848	2016-02-17T20:54:23	Perhaps the worst part of Clinton and Sanders touting endorsements of bereaved black family members is how supporters frequently use them.

JamilSmith	698706939761586176	2016-02-14T03:14:50	Jeb Bush should probably show support for women with his platform, not by using them as cudgels in his fights with Donald Trump.

JamilSmith	698697125975236608	2016-02-14T02:35:50	Some believe George W. launched a war partially because of an insult to his father, so this behavior from Jeb isn‚Äôt all that surprising.

JamilSmith	698692624392327168	2016-02-14T02:17:57	For the record, JebBush was the only person on stage who defended the president‚Äôs constitutional power to appoint without reservation.
JamilSmith	698692470742372352	2016-02-14T02:17:20	Ted Cruz‚Äôs ‚Äúone justice away‚Äù litany should motivate every single liberal to vote in this election.

JamilSmith	698690880870490114	2016-02-14T02:11:01	Kasich‚Äôs answer was even worse than Trump‚Äôs. You don‚Äôt heal the partisan divide by capitulating to one of the parties.

JamilSmith	698689971390124034	2016-02-14T02:07:24	First GOPDebate question is about Scalia; goes to Trump. Challenged on his call for Obama to not nominate a Justice. Avoids the question.
JamilSmith	698687724367253505	2016-02-14T01:58:29	I like POTUS using the phrase ‚Äúplenty of time.‚Äù Not just to consider a SCOTUS nominee, but for him to be around. 11 months can be a while.
JamilSmith	698686923305545728	2016-02-14T01:55:18	As AriMelber notes, it would be weird for POTUS not to nominate a successor to Scalia. Yet, here we are, treading water in insanity.

JamilSmith	698680131108339712	2016-02-14T01:28:18	A GOP Senate won't likely confirm an Obama nominee. Same with Clinton or Sanders. jbouie, on what may be in store. 
JamilSmith	698677850354929664	2016-02-14T01:19:14	Clinton‚Äôs Scalia statement certainly benefited from having given sufficient time for the SenateMajLdr to properly embarrass himself.
JamilSmith	698676608153075712	2016-02-14T01:14:18	Here are BernieSanders &amp; HillaryClinton‚Äôs responses to Antonin Scalia‚Äôs passing: 
JamilSmith	698673478107586562	2016-02-14T01:01:52	No one is disputing that fact, NoahCRothman. But you and I both know that isn't what SenateMajLdr was talking about.
JamilSmith	698667803814072321	2016-02-14T00:39:19	I truly hope that there is a black woman on POTUS's Supreme Court shortlist.
JamilSmith	698665936673497088	2016-02-14T00:31:54	The last two times the American voters had a voice in who should nominate Supreme Court Justices, senatemajldr, they picked Barack Obama.

JamilSmith	698662264317067266	2016-02-14T00:17:18	What is more disrespectful to a strict constitutionalist Justice: Nominating his replacement, or declaring a POTUS shouldn‚Äôt replace him?
JamilSmith	698660659387633664	2016-02-14T00:10:56	It isn‚Äôt disrespectful for POTUS to use his power to quickly nominate a replacement. Scalia, a strict constitutionalist, might agree.
JamilSmith	698659834636455936	2016-02-14T00:07:39	Scalia's death, loisbeckett notes, calls into question the Supreme Court's already divided stance on gun rights. 
JamilSmith	698656492354985985	2016-02-13T23:54:22	You would think. 
JamilSmith	698655637497126912	2016-02-13T23:50:59	It'd be a rebuke to Obama voters to allow GOP intransigence to stop him from nominating, but I don't think we have to worry about that.
JamilSmith	698655135770263552	2016-02-13T23:48:59	On MSNBC, Lindsey Graham insists that whenever Obama would nominate should be a "consensus choice." Who might that be? "Orrin Hatch." Okay.
JamilSmith	698654070895177728	2016-02-13T23:44:45	I hope that President Obama nominates someone tomorrow. Yes, I know what Republicans have said. I hope he nominates someone tomorrow.
JamilSmith	698630614354960384	2016-02-13T22:11:33	I hope people realize what's at stake in the presidential election now, if they didn't already.

JamilSmith	697864523269582848	2016-02-11T19:27:22	What's most troubling isn't Bernie Sanders's view of President Obama so much as his view of the presidency. It's very Green Lanternish.
JamilSmith	697864097937772544	2016-02-11T19:25:41	Sanders has been saying that black voters will like him once they get to know him. That remark about Obama's leadership is quite the intro.

JamilSmith	697522865533378564	2016-02-10T20:49:45	Black voters see the difference between one candidate calling for ‚Äúrevolution,‚Äù and another going to Flint. Symbolic or not, that matters.
JamilSmith	697522407922249728	2016-02-10T20:47:56	Whether Clinton earns black votes, we‚Äôll see. She clearly knows she needs to earn it. But don‚Äôt imply that those she persuades are suckers.
JamilSmith	697520316931657729	2016-02-10T20:39:37	I wrote last summer that Clinton was the first Dem frontrunner in eons who‚Äôd have to truly fight for the black vote. Now I see her doing it.
JamilSmith	697519773844791296	2016-02-10T20:37:28	I‚Äôll add that the varied responses of backers of Clinton and of Sanders to their candidate being pushed on racial justice has told me a lot.
JamilSmith	697519691330228224	2016-02-10T20:37:08	I don‚Äôt see black voters choosing Clinton as being suckered, as Alexander implies. I see many being unwilling to take a chance on Sanders.
JamilSmith	697519105000083456	2016-02-10T20:34:48	Perhaps, darrensands, but Sharpton didn't endorse him. Also, a meeting at Sylvia's with the Rev while Clinton goes to Flint seems light.
JamilSmith	697517796163366912	2016-02-10T20:29:36	I see two keys for black voters: protecting Obama‚Äôs legacy, and defeating the Republicans. Does that leave out a lot? Yes. Is it wrong? No.
JamilSmith	697516735461662722	2016-02-10T20:25:23	Electability is key to what HillaryClinton is selling to black voters. Note what Eric Holder says in this ad. 
JamilSmith	697515256269025280	2016-02-10T20:19:30	Even if Sanders won, Alexander expresses real doubt (that I share) about how would his "revolution" would work inside that party structure.
JamilSmith	697515113796886528	2016-02-10T20:18:56	Alexander, rightly, points to the larger dilemma for black voters: TheDemocrats. This, to me, is her most convincing argument.
JamilSmith	697513916125937664	2016-02-10T20:14:11	Bill Clinton was indisputably an awful president for African Americans. But I think voters understand how much worse a Republican would be.
JamilSmith	697512892246073344	2016-02-10T20:10:07	Black voters may be choose Clinton because they see her a) actually fighting for their votes and b) as their best chance to defeat the GOP.
JamilSmith	697512405669052416	2016-02-10T20:08:11	I see the black vote centering around the ‚Äúlesser evil‚Äù choice Alexander writes about ‚Äî but that greater evil is the Republican Party.
JamilSmith	697511707657129985	2016-02-10T20:05:24	I do take issue with one part of Alexander‚Äôs argument: positing that if black people are choosing Clinton primarily because of branding.
JamilSmith	697511124577624064	2016-02-10T20:03:05	Michelle Alexander makes the case for why Clinton doesn‚Äôt deserve the black vote. Whoever‚Äôs side you‚Äôre on, read it. 
JamilSmith	697509071310618624	2016-02-10T19:54:56	I appreciate what tanehisicoates tweeted earlier. Telling people who you personally plan to vote for is not the same as an endorsement.
JamilSmith	697495274546049024	2016-02-10T19:00:06	Casey's being generous--but yes, come on through if you're in Portland today. 
JamilSmith	697438858158342144	2016-02-10T15:15:56	We got National Book Award winner jesmimi on the ‚Äúbama" blackness in Beyonc√©‚Äôs Formation  
JamilSmith	697440646957817857	2016-02-10T15:23:02	So: Hillary is still accountable for the 1994 crime bill because she was FLOTUS. Bernie voted for it, but it's ok because he didn't mean it?
JamilSmith	697456950137720832	2016-02-10T16:27:49	Great piece by SeanMcElwee on evidence that the Tea Party's rise was about racial resentment, not economic anxiety 
JamilSmith	697449151164887041	2016-02-10T15:56:50	When did Clinton claim that, mikedarmi? Specifically. Seems to me from her actions, she understands that she needs to earn the black vote.
JamilSmith	697445683746336768	2016-02-10T15:43:03	Clintonites condescend to young women. Sanders supporters do the same to black voters. Neither are helping. 
JamilSmith	697444228465586177	2016-02-10T15:37:16	It's almost like his criticisms came from a place of genuine belief rather than a calculated plot to boost Clinton 
JamilSmith	697296311419326464	2016-02-10T05:49:30	If you follow my Twitter feed you know that I am 100% with ezraklein on this. Trump is not funny. He is dangerous. 
JamilSmith	697296531737579520	2016-02-10T05:50:22	Clinton has seized the Flint issue, as well as abortion. But I argued Sanders can still own voting rights. He isn't. 
JamilSmith	697295249886982144	2016-02-10T05:45:17	I argued recently what BernieSanders needs to do to persuade black and Latino voters: stop asking us to trust him. 
JamilSmith	697294555897397248	2016-02-10T05:42:31	I get that the Clintons have a huge advantage with the black electorate, but Sanders can't keep using that line. Make the "intro" already.
JamilSmith	697294110562975746	2016-02-10T05:40:45	Voters of color cannot afford for Obama to have a Republican successor. As Doc Brown once said, the consequences could be disastrous.
JamilSmith	697293596777558016	2016-02-10T05:38:43	If BernieSanders loses a general election, he'd likely still have his job in the Senate. But voters of color would be shit out of luck.
JamilSmith	697293284889092097	2016-02-10T05:37:28	Second: Sanders takes no account for the possibility that black voters may be very suspect about the likelihood he's defeat a Republican.
JamilSmith	697292263852933120	2016-02-10T05:33:25	When Sanders says, in effect, "black voters'll love me when they get to know me" for 10 months, that is taking an electorate for granted.
JamilSmith	697291402976190464	2016-02-10T05:30:00	First: If Sanders hasn't bothered, in 10 months, to "introduce" himself to black voters in such a way that is persuasive, that's on him.
JamilSmith	697291046670106624	2016-02-10T05:28:35	However, BernieSanders keeps saying that black voters don't know him yet, hence his terrible numbers with them. It's silly on two counts.

JamilSmith	696177240929918977	2016-02-07T03:42:43	Abortion intersects with poverty, the environment, and more. We just saw a terrorist attack a clinic last fall. Lots of ways to discuss it.
JamilSmith	696176463989620737	2016-02-07T03:39:38	If Clinton and Sanders aren't directly asked about abortion in a debate, they should bring it up somehow. This isn't just about clinics.
JamilSmith	696175954633363456	2016-02-07T03:37:36	Yes, Clinton and Sanders agree on abortion and voting rights. I argue that they should be debating it anyway. 
JamilSmith	696175400867753984	2016-02-07T03:35:24	The Democrats are running a woman endorsed by PPact, and the only candidates we see debating abortion are a bunch of conservative men.
JamilSmith	696174576640921601	2016-02-07T03:32:08	When you act like you‚Äôre afraid to discuss abortion, Democrats, you let Republican lies about the procedure fill the airwaves. Bravo.
JamilSmith	696174018915909632	2016-02-07T03:29:55	By the way, TheDemocrats, the Republicans just showed you why your candidates should mention abortion in debates. 
JamilSmith	696173781111476224	2016-02-07T03:28:58	I want us to stop referring to the National Conversation About Race. We're obviously speaking many different tongues here.

JamilSmith	696172833844699136	2016-02-07T03:25:12	If you're going to ask a question about race, even to Donald Trump, it has to be based in reality. The Ferguson Effect is not reality.
JamilSmith	696170685178241026	2016-02-07T03:16:40	Exactly. It is ridiculous that we‚Äôve had racial justice questions in GOP and Democratic debates framed this way. 
JamilSmith	696168779949203456	2016-02-07T03:09:05	We knew a Trump answer to a police brutality question would be full of fuckery. But so was the question itself. Ferguson Effect, again?

JamilSmith	696166760974786561	2016-02-07T03:01:04	Is it worth it to get to look at the short film? Maybe. But it's a bad look to claim someone cheated you when you have to know they didn't.
JamilSmith	696165777557364737	2016-02-07T02:57:10	It seems that the guys who shot the footage that ended up in Beyonce's video didn't actually own it. Not sure why they were complaining.
JamilSmith	696139683940667392	2016-02-07T01:13:28	Are you sure that‚Äôs how you want to frame this piece of news?

JamilSmith	696130766489718784	2016-02-07T00:38:02	That Cosmopolitan tweet and Steinem's stupidity about young women both demonstrate that feminism is nothing without intersectionality.
JamilSmith	696129450803654657	2016-02-07T00:32:49	Gloria Steinem says young women are supporting Bernie Sanders because, why? Boys. Sounded like a Republican.

JamilSmith	696043312046874624	2016-02-06T18:50:32	I did not write this. 
JamilSmith	696015014440935425	2016-02-06T16:58:05	I have taken that all into account, EyeOnThePitch. It doesn't excuse the abuse I've seen out here. What I'm getting is mild by comparison.
JamilSmith	696011553091547136	2016-02-06T16:44:20	Not questioning facts so much, EyeOnThePitch, as people insisting that I'm a poor journalist for merely offering critique about Sanders.
JamilSmith	696008439504437248	2016-02-06T16:31:57	Obviously, EyeOnThePitch, I know that. The column, however, isn't a criticism of Sanders. That is why I'm expressing what I am now.
JamilSmith	696007351753641984	2016-02-06T16:27:38	I have not endorsed anyone in the presidential race, nor will I. Not to slight those journalists who have. It just isn't what I'll be doing.
