Trader_Dante	724904487241060353	2016-04-26T10:14:32	Didn't extend into the gap...oh well, expect Bunds to test 09-13s now

Trader_Dante	721732753109164032	2016-04-17T16:11:12	Guys - If you want women to stop you in the street and ask you what scent you are wearing, try this. Seriously

Trader_Dante	720946140921901056	2016-04-15T12:05:29	When you are primarily a Bund trader but USD/CAD is paying your wages this week, you know something is fucked up

Trader_Dante	720898424187564032	2016-04-15T08:55:52	How to spot an amateur.  They are obsessed with trading the  EURUSD which is moving in a 20 pip range...sideways

Trader_Dante	720644591460958208	2016-04-14T16:07:14	So let me get this straight. I trade for a living I pay normal fees. I say I am a coach and I pay professional fees?
Trader_Dante	720644254075351044	2016-04-14T16:05:53	Instead, you tell them you are an educator and suddenly they label you professional and whack the fees up. WTF?
Trader_Dante	720644133854031872	2016-04-14T16:05:25	I have a dream that one day the trading exchanges will regard trading educators as...unable to trade.
Trader_Dante	720638925652434944	2016-04-14T15:44:43	I love it when brokers want proof of address from a physical statement but all bills are paperless nowadays?

Trader_Dante	720584955110277121	2016-04-14T12:10:15	There are 2 moments to walk away from the charts. When you have a trade on and when you don't have a trade on. New traders won't get this 1.

Trader_Dante	719885282133307393	2016-04-12T13:50:00	...in the beginning varying risk will ruin many traders. When you start out, keep your risk as small as you can but keep it constant.
Trader_Dante	719885111056068608	2016-04-12T13:49:19	Ironically whilst I said yesterday to vary your risk among strategies that is only once you have a decent sample size...

Trader_Dante	719545045033099264	2016-04-11T15:18:01	geula4 I will skew the risk a little higher for the first one
Trader_Dante	719544966998044672	2016-04-11T15:17:43	geula4 but for example I have one strategy with a 76% win prob and 1.7R payoff and another with a 43% win prob and a 2R payoff.
Trader_Dante	719544730388926464	2016-04-11T15:16:46	If it makes money I will trade it geula4 
Trader_Dante	719544010013032448	2016-04-11T15:13:55	E.g. if strategy A and B are both profitable but B has a better expectancy and higher win prob (so less drawdown) I would allocate more to B
Trader_Dante	719543564733165568	2016-04-11T15:12:08	It's a good tip if you trade several different strategies to consider allocating  differing levels of risk to them

Trader_Dante	718485657736384513	2016-04-08T17:08:24	Thing is if you choose the spoos, that might not move &amp; how you gonna get into that if does? How far that could go offside in a year?
Trader_Dante	718485196308353024	2016-04-08T17:06:34	Crude is tempting because the risk of drawdown before price is reached is less but what if it hadn't moved much?
Trader_Dante	718484988216360960	2016-04-08T17:05:44	Kalei53scop3 why?
Trader_Dante	718484192338800644	2016-04-08T17:02:34	Poll: if you could know one of these prices ahead of time but could only trade it with futures not options. Which?

Trader_Dante	718448582869782531	2016-04-08T14:41:04	chuckremes No, trend followers don't generally try buying when price is tanking as far as I am aware
Trader_Dante	718448106099052544	2016-04-08T14:39:11	ISeeYourStops good point, nicely made
Trader_Dante	718447716632764416	2016-04-08T14:37:38	Knayc777 no. The major difference was I was planning on running it that far before I got in. The image refers to changing  plan due to PA
Trader_Dante	718442591453323264	2016-04-08T14:17:16	This is another one of my favourite mistakes people make

Trader_Dante	718427940153921537	2016-04-08T13:19:03	Speaking of the "A, B, X" pattern I just tweeted...check USD/JPY 
Trader_Dante	718424718295085057	2016-04-08T13:06:15	Thank you, sir 
Trader_Dante	718419676615819265	2016-04-08T12:46:13	This pattern occurs frequently. It is why you never use a break even stop 
Trader_Dante	718417513822961664	2016-04-08T12:37:37	People miss the "A" trade, steam in with FOMO at "B", stop out at "X" and then see it hit "T" without them 
Trader_Dante	718416834966523905	2016-04-08T12:34:55	Because you can detrimentally skew the payoff by entering after its moved considertably 
Trader_Dante	718416275819655168	2016-04-08T12:32:42	A lot of money is lost from FOMO.  If you miss a good level, wait for the next one.  Don't pay up/down in between just because its moving
Trader_Dante	718416131900510208	2016-04-08T12:32:08	If you went long down there, well done. If not, patiently await next entry. Don't just pay up retail prices

Trader_Dante	718389462733090816	2016-04-08T10:46:09	That is why, to avoid confusion, sometimes I can be bullish but not long / bearish but not short.
Trader_Dante	718389260399820801	2016-04-08T10:45:21	For me it is important to not only try and locate a bias but then find a high probability and cheap way into it
Trader_Dante	718388978240614400	2016-04-08T10:44:14	GittensNathan no, because price has already breached the IW and ID lows

Trader_Dante	718382848525340675	2016-04-08T10:19:52	Again, keep  your eyes on the IDF in GBP/USD and a possible IWF if we close EOD above 1.4119. Could be the start of something bigger
Trader_Dante	718372216761618434	2016-04-08T09:37:37	Aggressive longs in GBP/USD here at 1.4078 for the cheap trade. I'm still not ready to commit though and will wait this out until next week
Trader_Dante	718370624461283329	2016-04-08T09:31:18	The Daily inverse H&amp;S everyone is talking about in GBPUSD is not doing a great job of materialising...

Trader_Dante	717765937865363456	2016-04-06T17:28:29	I posted that shit on the biggest boards on the Internet. A dumb thing to do because it meant the edge shut down quicker but I still did it

Trader_Dante	717765501498351617	2016-04-06T17:26:45	That's the logical conclusion. Unfortunately it doesn't account for ego. The need to show everyone how clever you are because you found it
Trader_Dante	717765375123922944	2016-04-06T17:26:15	It's interesting a lot of people say: "if you found out a way to make huge amounts of money why would you tell everyone? You wouldn't"

Trader_Dante	716250610677465089	2016-04-02T13:07:07	Trader_Dante and we're back with the hair 
Trader_Dante	716251607885856768	2016-04-02T13:11:05	5) Trading the lower time frames is noise and trading large numbers of times is bad
Trader_Dante	716251514122186752	2016-04-02T13:10:42	3) If you have a strategy that works you will eventually get rich 4)  Moving to break even means a free trade

Trader_Dante	716214328349818880	2016-04-02T10:42:57	Yes TomP_78 because whilst its profitable its not massively which increases variance 
Trader_Dante	716213997301809152	2016-04-02T10:41:38	TraderPaulFX Who have you been blocked by?
Trader_Dante	716211886006603777	2016-04-02T10:33:14	If people start spouting off about how its all skill and no luck etc they are either a salesman or an egoist.

Trader_Dante	716211376902053888	2016-04-02T10:31:13	Jokes aside - the shorter the time horizon the more luck CAN account for returns (or lack of them) I don't believe this is debatable
Trader_Dante	716211058130755584	2016-04-02T10:29:57	And that's not even considering moments like when you leave the desk to take a shit and there is a terrorist attack
Trader_Dante	716208485952798720	2016-04-02T10:19:44	Sometimes people argue there is no luck in this game. mugs 
Trader_Dante	716203145819455488	2016-04-02T09:58:31	Here is a treat for you ledges - 
Trader_Dante	716189986287194112	2016-04-02T09:06:13	You might ask: What is the probability of a gap filling? Of the market going up on month end? etc Work it out.
Trader_Dante	716189507201138688	2016-04-02T09:04:19	And finally once you have answered those try to arm yourself with a new piece of information that you didn't have last week. statistics

Trader_Dante	716188856782028800	2016-04-02T09:01:44	After you have completed the checklist try to answer these following questions...
Trader_Dante	716177417157681152	2016-04-02T08:16:16	Weekend checklist for ledges: 1) Have you reviewed the week that was? 2) Have you recorded all trades? 3) Have you made a plan for the open?
Trader_Dante	715980557767811072	2016-04-01T19:14:01	And on that random note, I'm done for the week. Have a great weekend and speak Sunday ledges.
Trader_Dante	715980376263491584	2016-04-01T19:13:18	Regardless of the morals of the wars we fight in, those men deserve utmost respect for laying their lives on the line.
Trader_Dante	715980152702939136	2016-04-01T19:12:25	This is really random but just I wanted to say thank you to all soldiers who have fought for our freedom.
Trader_Dante	715970145588527104	2016-04-01T18:32:39	GittensNathan ...that level looks like buying support last though so I avoid those
Trader_Dante	715970051229224961	2016-04-01T18:32:16	GittensNathan I pull them only if the market is close to the level into the news...
Trader_Dante	715965163229327360	2016-04-01T18:12:51	TradingDuck yes its coming tomorrow morning ledge

Trader_Dante	715948784031809536	2016-04-01T17:07:46	TeamCropDusters MattH actually by definition it can be either
Trader_Dante	715948086774915073	2016-04-01T17:05:00	TeamCropDusters mattth I can't be bothered to argue I don't agree let's leave it at that. It's Friday night

Trader_Dante	715921988007682049	2016-04-01T15:21:17	TeamCropDusters If that helps you make sense of this career fine but I disagree

Trader_Dante	715919667731308544	2016-04-01T15:12:04	Agree to an extent but usually its considered to be taking risk for monetary reward 
Trader_Dante	715919335735341056	2016-04-01T15:10:45	I had to say this as I saw an educator vehemently deny trading was gambling and once again that is more bullshit.
Trader_Dante	715919185470222337	2016-04-01T15:10:09	The definition of gambling doesn't take into account whether you have an edge.  It simply means "playing games of chance for money"
Trader_Dante	715919035226054656	2016-04-01T15:09:33	I love it when people say "trading is NOT gambling" because you have an edge - high probability setups blah bah blah. Sorry, it IS gambling
Trader_Dante	715917993323143169	2016-04-01T15:05:25	Just depends whether you want to actually babysit this at 4PM on a Friday - if you do, should be a good trade to end the week
Trader_Dante	715917627328225281	2016-04-01T15:03:58	Expect a bounce from this level - 1.4178 - in GBPUSD into the close

Trader_Dante	715891297169620992	2016-04-01T13:19:20	It's always important to have a written business plan and I think it helps to have a visual plan too.

Trader_Dante	715202664972337152	2016-03-30T15:42:57	He refused to trade bunds and spent all his time, energy and eventually money in the Dax.  Complete turd.
Trader_Dante	715202494318698496	2016-03-30T15:42:17	Like that turd I used to sit with that made money in Bunds and lost it in Dax but hated bunds because it was "slow" and Dax was "exciting"
Trader_Dante	715202254547075072	2016-03-30T15:41:19	If hands off works better, fuck off and do something worthwhile with your life and make money at the same time. Some peope are proper mugs

Trader_Dante	715201491028545536	2016-03-30T15:38:17	1) Are you wasting time and money managing trades? Compare active management with a hands off stop or target approach
Trader_Dante	715201120612827137	2016-03-30T15:36:49	The "holy grail" is whatever makes you the most money for the least time. With that in mind, get off YouTube and run some stats...

Trader_Dante	713304149757190144	2016-03-25T09:58:56	Problem is they know they can't effectively police it so they resort to deterrent tactics. Which is simply unfair.
Trader_Dante	713303582762778624	2016-03-25T09:56:41	Same with Nav. If spoofing to profit is illegal, then charge everyone that does it not one guy that coincidentally does it during a crash

Trader_Dante	713012547503304705	2016-03-24T14:40:13	Trader_Dante very good points sir. Would also help force me to trade appropriate size at all times thanks
Trader_Dante	713012324546834432	2016-03-24T14:39:19	the question is better asked: why would you keep entire balance with your broker? TRT2pt0 
Trader_Dante	713012038419759105	2016-03-24T14:38:11	TRT2pt0 Base your risk on the "pot" but only keep 10% of the pot with the broker.
Trader_Dante	713011930881925120	2016-03-24T14:37:46	TRT2pt0 since you trade with leverage there is also no need to keep the entire balance with them
Trader_Dante	713011862816886789	2016-03-24T14:37:29	TRT2pt0 Most brokers do not pay interested on the balance and are likely not as safe as a savings institution
Trader_Dante	713011729723166721	2016-03-24T14:36:58	Yes - only store 10% of capital with your broker. TRT2pt0

Trader_Dante	712571761628459008	2016-03-23T09:28:41	...with it reluctant to move down, the short stops above 40 become vulnerable and we can look for a test of yesterdays VPOC above that
Trader_Dante	712571471978237952	2016-03-23T09:27:32	Bunds clearly looks like it wants to collapse. However its doing a terrible job of  moving lower...
Trader_Dante	712571291790917632	2016-03-23T09:26:49	Always ask  yourself - where does price look like it wants to go and how well a job is it doing of going there?
Trader_Dante	712569168793640960	2016-03-23T09:18:23	I will try selling on ralliles into both those areas.
Trader_Dante	712569121888739328	2016-03-23T09:18:12	I believe Bunds will not make a concerted effort to go down until we have tested 162.56 with 162.74 being the line in the sand for bears

Trader_Dante	708329082275176452	2016-03-11T16:29:47	Sounds impressive. But when risk levels are shown it can change the picture.
Trader_Dante	708328741508923392	2016-03-11T16:28:26	My percentage return on statements to get into prop was 1,400% over 3 months
Trader_Dante	708328468665266176	2016-03-11T16:27:21	And without detracting from either, bear in mind returns without knowing risk taken and drawdown are irrelevant when this is a business
Trader_Dante	708328178385874944	2016-03-11T16:26:12	In meantime, well done to both. Outstanding return ICT_MHuddleston also excellent from stocktrader_ams considering account size and OPM

Trader_Dante	707294120574914560	2016-03-08T19:57:13	BreakingOutBad Hopefully, this clears it up. 
Trader_Dante	707281609712533504	2016-03-08T19:07:31	The best trades will literally jump out at you. If you learn to only take those types of trades, with set risk and target, good things come.

Trader_Dante	706531556798681090	2016-03-06T17:27:04	It's probably the first time since I started mentoring alongside trading in May 2010 that I have had an empty inbox. Please, no one mail me.

Trader_Dante	706517134369800192	2016-03-06T16:29:45	NotnormalFX What I mean is if someone starts with a $500 account and risk 2% per trade...its going to test your patience big time
Trader_Dante	706503534951460864	2016-03-06T15:35:43	shadowpipper no it's Tuesday ledge
Trader_Dante	706496488524931072	2016-03-06T15:07:43	Next webinar is on Tuesday at 8PM (today is Mothers day ledges)
Trader_Dante	706494226641645568	2016-03-06T14:58:44	Yes, a great tune. Feel a bit guilty  tweeting the remix though because the original is a thing of sheer beauty 
Trader_Dante	706490217604186113	2016-03-06T14:42:48	jazfiz13 The original is better but lacks the big beat:  
Trader_Dante	706487581857464321	2016-03-06T14:32:20	BuucketHe4d no, that's not my job. That is a personal decision.
Trader_Dante	706485494885031936	2016-03-06T14:24:02	An absolutely epic tune to start your Sunday. Don't kill me for listening to the Royksopp Remix: 
Trader_Dante	706483601106444288	2016-03-06T14:16:30	Just one example...but an important one.
Trader_Dante	706483499570761728	2016-03-06T14:16:06	Then you show them an edge taking 3 trades a week. And guess what they can't do it. Because they don't have the patience (or account size)
Trader_Dante	706483297241722880	2016-03-06T14:15:18	...people eager to learn often say..."whats this crap about find something that fits...just show me what you do, if you do it, I can do it"
Trader_Dante	706483146838171648	2016-03-06T14:14:42	Also when people say: "choose a strategy that resonates with you" it comes down to those four principles...
Trader_Dante	706483001169997824	2016-03-06T14:14:07	If you are losing money the reason is one (or more) of those four.
Trader_Dante	706482656196870145	2016-03-06T14:12:45	The key factors that dicate your return:  1) Strike rate 2) Payoff 3) Trade frequency 4) Risk taken per trade

Trader_Dante	705703417864429568	2016-03-04T10:36:20	Agree.  You don't get Twitter and think you're going to get 12k followers and be a trade educator.

Trader_Dante	705698821368639492	2016-03-04T10:18:04	If 95% of you cats knew what it took to get here, youd run a fucking mile right now.
Trader_Dante	705698702678233088	2016-03-04T10:17:36	So first and foremost - stop dreaming like a fucking fairy and think long and hard.
Trader_Dante	705698576786169856	2016-03-04T10:17:06	People want to stand at the top of the mountain but they don't want to pack the gear, prep for years and then endure the climb
Trader_Dante	705698285542055936	2016-03-04T10:15:57	Ask a professional what they went through - the tears, the stress,  the frustration, the relationships they lost-  the COST
Trader_Dante	705698065445986304	2016-03-04T10:15:04	The first thing you should do is decide whether the juice is worth the squeeze.
Trader_Dante	705697961439830016	2016-03-04T10:14:39	People often ask me what is the first thing a new trader should do...I will tell you...
Trader_Dante	705697239109410817	2016-03-04T10:11:47	...but people grab MT4, get busy clicking with their mouse and think they are going to make several million trading Forex.
Trader_Dante	705697015141945344	2016-03-04T10:10:54	As that ledge dmg_FutexLive said to me yesterday "You don't kick a ball about at the park and think you can be Messi..."
Trader_Dante	705694277955952640	2016-03-04T10:00:01	4) You've just bought a disposable lighter repair kit for $109.99.  Congratulations to Ron from Lancaster
Trader_Dante	705694113983758336	2016-03-04T09:59:22	3) Then they start the CLOCK. There has to be a clock because pressure causes you to make quick decisions
Trader_Dante	705693878339424256	2016-03-04T09:58:26	(on a side note:  that new level looks like a bargain but u only think it is because you base value on what it was selling at a minute ago)
Trader_Dante	705693503238610944	2016-03-04T09:56:56	2) Then they rapidly drop the auction price it to a new level that is "perceived" to be decent value
Trader_Dante	705693367645184001	2016-03-04T09:56:24	Think about a shopping channel.   1) They show you the asset and then start the bidding with a fixed price.
Trader_Dante	705692832808505344	2016-03-04T09:54:17	It's all time and price.   And how the two come together and  make you "feel".
Trader_Dante	705692214622605312	2016-03-04T09:51:49	It's advertising for your liquidity constantly.   You either know what you want or you're at the mercy of falling for every decent advert.
Trader_Dante	705691972024008704	2016-03-04T09:50:51	If you are new to this, think of the market you are watching as one continuous advert. That's all it is.
Trader_Dante	705691416710811648	2016-03-04T09:48:39	Remember: Price movements are not there to make sure you lose. They are there to make sure you trade.

Trader_Dante	705453573405065216	2016-03-03T18:03:33	BrianLandsman Agree. I always felt with King that the ending were a massive let down
Trader_Dante	705452610048933888	2016-03-03T17:59:43	No, I am no longer bearish. I actually never sold it. Only level I had was 6673 but it hit to late for me yesterday 
Trader_Dante	705452063069741056	2016-03-03T17:57:33	BrianLandsman did you ever see the film?
Trader_Dante	705449402933121024	2016-03-03T17:46:58	Agreed BrianLandsman  This lady sophieannaward bought me "A Prayer" when I was 16. It made me cry my eyes out.  
Trader_Dante	705446771690971137	2016-03-03T17:36:31	Not sure how they put  "Far From The Madding Crowd" but not "Jude the Obscure" but suppose the beauty is its all ur own opinion
Trader_Dante	705446507814756353	2016-03-03T17:35:28	Garland had one book in him, "The Tesseract" was a joke, I don't even remember "Coma" so it must have been weak
Trader_Dante	705445751703396352	2016-03-03T17:32:28	The film probably stopped many people reading it. They will never know what they missed
Trader_Dante	705445609931722753	2016-03-03T17:31:54	"The Beach" an incredible book - sadly destroyed by the piece of shit film
Trader_Dante	705445167554273282	2016-03-03T17:30:09	Read all of those except the last one. Would never have put Stephen Kings "The Stand" in there!

Trader_Dante	703258108588638209	2016-02-26T16:39:33	BreakingOutBad 2% risk of account on a 100 tick stop, a 500 tick gap past it costs you 12%.  2% on a 10 tick stop,  you owe your broker
Trader_Dante	703257343191031808	2016-02-26T16:36:31	BreakingOutBad ...is mainly to do with the size of their stop.
Trader_Dante	703257230733344769	2016-02-26T16:36:04	BreakingOutBad because the tighter the stop the more slippage kills  you. E.g. EURCHF. The reason people went into negative equity...

Trader_Dante	703168953598627840	2016-02-26T10:45:17	That's because she is a power tweeter (too much for me to keep up) with a lot of political commentary and never mentions my main market
Trader_Dante	703168619413307392	2016-02-26T10:43:57	I've known NicTrades longer than anyone I follow. I know for a fact she makes money as a trader and also consider her a friend. Yet no FF

Trader_Dante	703157195437797376	2016-02-26T09:58:34	Bund traders have just seen my tweet about Dax and realised that should mean Bunds go down.

Trader_Dante	703154486580097025	2016-02-26T09:47:48	EURGBP going down faster than a narcoleptic on Ketamine
Trader_Dante	703148719894454272	2016-02-26T09:24:53	I do think that Bunds will trade above 166.25 today but so far very hard to get in and hold it unless you walk away
Trader_Dante	703142447539326976	2016-02-26T08:59:57	Just lost one follower. I will bet todays profits that they talk into their watch. You guys are so transparent!!

Trader_Dante	703136043378159616	2016-02-26T08:34:31	I genuinely thought that would offer more than 11 ticks!! 
Trader_Dante	703129467552604160	2016-02-26T08:08:23	Yesterdays VVAH held. Highs feel very susceptible to a probe - look for it to advertise for buyers above 25 
Trader_Dante	703127541947588609	2016-02-26T08:00:44	Bund looks good for immediate upside from here

Trader_Dante	702925161163563010	2016-02-25T18:36:32	This is an obvious one. Question. Why did I say it looked good from the 60m tf? And where is it going? (weekly)

Trader_Dante	701786029267820544	2016-02-22T15:10:02	If you got the H1 SFP in GBPUSD and it still hasn't shaken out (despite everyone being long) then hold that bitch
Trader_Dante	701784239566622720	2016-02-22T15:02:55	If you squint a lot (+you are already short) this could be a daily h&amp;s that has triggered in Silver.

Trader_Dante	701759204281995268	2016-02-22T13:23:27	Pretty much free money into that level so far past ATR.  
Trader_Dante	701758319728451584	2016-02-22T13:19:56	GBPUSD H1 SFP is a decent enough trade but it's all about GBPJPY for me 
Trader_Dante	701744348623466496	2016-02-22T12:24:25	Looking for longs in GBPJPY around 159.20
Trader_Dante	701743676834324481	2016-02-22T12:21:44	GBPUSD going to hell in a handbasket. Don't try to pick a bottom in it. Unless you've done my course and are therefore a fucking ledge.

Trader_Dante	699919389269868544	2016-02-17T11:32:40	. ICT_MHuddleston stocktrader_ams Yes. Ams has to lower the amount or you go up. That makes it a fair battle 
Trader_Dante	699918975816310784	2016-02-17T11:31:02	. ICT_MHuddleston stocktrader_ams there is no incentive to deposit more as your 4.2% return will drop to 2.5%

Trader_Dante	699918540867047424	2016-02-17T11:29:18	. ICT_MHuddleston stocktrader_ams If Ams deposits 20k and you deposit 5k then you have a lot less pressure to bet large with less at stake

Trader_Dante	699916692726616065	2016-02-17T11:21:58	. ICT_MHuddleston I don't think thats fair
Trader_Dante	699912641838505984	2016-02-17T11:05:52	. ICT_MHuddleston Good start but just  to confirm, thats 4.2% return on cap deposited which is 60% of the total.

Trader_Dante	697349998342705152	2016-02-10T09:22:50	Bund moves inversely to stoxx until you rely on it.. As soon as you  lean on it, you've done your ring
Trader_Dante	697349584595591168	2016-02-10T09:21:11	Watch the Eurostoxx for confirmation they said.  I could get more useful info on a Greg Secker course
Trader_Dante	697349218520997888	2016-02-10T09:19:44	Anyone not done their ring in bunds this morning?  Don't lie
Trader_Dante	697326128818745344	2016-02-10T07:47:59	83tycoon that is a level on EUR/USD but I'm not taking it as it's just below a big daily

Trader_Dante	697140404030988288	2016-02-09T19:29:59	TheInnerpreneur muiris30 ICT_MHuddleston ...still I told ICT if he makes a vid and I learn something new I will always give credit!!
Trader_Dante	697140281137823745	2016-02-09T19:29:29	TheInnerpreneur muiris30 ICT_MHuddleston ...it breaks down what is happening on the DOM but it's just easier to process what is going on.
Trader_Dante	697140186707320832	2016-02-09T19:29:07	TheInnerpreneur muiris30 ICT_MHuddleston ...I prefer to use market/volume profile to find areas and then watch the footprint..
Trader_Dante	697140098450792449	2016-02-09T19:28:46	TheInnerpreneur muiris30 ICT_MHuddleston ...based on short term order flow. Front running orders on MOCs etc...
Trader_Dante	697140029261541384	2016-02-09T19:28:29	TheInnerpreneur muiris30 ICT_MHuddleston to be fair a lot of people I used to work with traded from the DOM trying to nick a few prices..
Trader_Dante	697138079983919111	2016-02-09T19:20:45	TheInnerpreneur for schooling on the DOM this is the man I'd go to NoBSDayTrading
Trader_Dante	697137949029310465	2016-02-09T19:20:13	TheInnerpreneur I execute from the DOM but almost exclusively use the FP to proces the info
Trader_Dante	697133384599019520	2016-02-09T19:02:05	AlgoSlayer lol!
Trader_Dante	697120719105368066	2016-02-09T18:11:45	fuckface I told you to leave her alone 
Trader_Dante	697120334596730880	2016-02-09T18:10:14	Love it when someone teaches how to follow the institutions. Unfortunately it assumes the institutions know what they are doing.
Trader_Dante	697098036871303168	2016-02-09T16:41:38	Trading is simple. Study price action and fundamentals closely for years. Then be patient, wait for the setup...  ....and do the opposite.
Trader_Dante	697097628811661315	2016-02-09T16:40:00	Fill was 66 dead on! Food4Monkeys 
Trader_Dante	697096757856051200	2016-02-09T16:36:33	Whatever happens with this, at least I meant to do it!!!
Trader_Dante	697096706215800832	2016-02-09T16:36:20	Now for my next trick I'm going to try and buy the USDCAD at 3775
Trader_Dante	697095943762616320	2016-02-09T16:33:19	Donnie_Eagle most profitable trade of 2016 and it was a mistake.   Taaaaxi!
Trader_Dante	697095302222901248	2016-02-09T16:30:46	Donnie_Eagle but the order filled overnight when I woke up I was +30....and the level was working so I thought lets try and ride the luck
Trader_Dante	697095202020921345	2016-02-09T16:30:22	Donnie_Eagle Well, I was taught in prop to do exactly that - close out the second you know its a mistake
Trader_Dante	697094795009904645	2016-02-09T16:28:45	Incidentally that is why this game is so hard. Sometimes you take the best trade and lose money. Other times you fuck up and still bank.
Trader_Dante	697094525421031424	2016-02-09T16:27:40	Made a mistake keeping the order in as market action invalidated it....and got paid handsomely for the mistake...
Trader_Dante	697094446261936129	2016-02-09T16:27:22	Finally closed EURJPY for +142 / +2.45R ...should never have been in it but such is life. 
Trader_Dante	697093899530215424	2016-02-09T16:25:11	Thanks man bullbear365

Trader_Dante	697055860699308033	2016-02-09T13:54:02	Thankfully I've got the experience necessary not to say: "+66, cracked it. Traded like a ledge." Instead: "+66 but still a cunt."
Trader_Dante	697055428669267969	2016-02-09T13:52:19	fuckface don't have time to work it out - Im taking it from all angles righr now
Trader_Dante	697054654933430272	2016-02-09T13:49:15	Never underestimate the role of luck in this game. I'm +66 so far today and I can't remember ever having made so many mistakes as today

Trader_Dante	697041293369876480	2016-02-09T12:56:09	Total panic. Long water, tinned fruit and beans. Short everything.
Trader_Dante	697035213080305664	2016-02-09T12:31:59	Very likely Bund goes back to HOD. I know you can't imagine it. That's why (and how) it will do it.

Trader_Dante	696750056519700480	2016-02-08T17:38:53	big_balls_jess I will make you a quick scope on it now if I may
Trader_Dante	696749514514894849	2016-02-08T17:36:43	big_balls_jess it's not easy to define but you know when you are in it that's for sure!!!
Trader_Dante	696749128248909826	2016-02-08T17:35:11	big_balls_jess ...that newbs usually mistake for a market running out of momentum so they try to fade it
Trader_Dante	696749019561852929	2016-02-08T17:34:45	big_balls_jess You are right but price moves in a variety of different ways in trends....the drift is a consistent, low volatiity grind...
Trader_Dante	696718234691772416	2016-02-08T15:32:26	Don't say "they won't get hit" because if that support level doesn't get breached I will volunteer at my local car wash for the day
Trader_Dante	696718040138956801	2016-02-08T15:31:39	USD/JPY flirting with a massive level at 115.55. Can you say stops? And do we see them hit now or overnight?
Trader_Dante	696706274747138051	2016-02-08T14:44:54	I have a few rules and one of them is "never trade against the drift". If you fuck with the drift of death you will regret it!
Trader_Dante	696705549388406784	2016-02-08T14:42:01	If everyone massively long and price doing the drift of death lower, get short ASAP balls deep
Trader_Dante	696705451858206720	2016-02-08T14:41:38	If everyone massively long and price flat lining then its a good chance, stops could be swept and you can look for shorts
Trader_Dante	696705281892487169	2016-02-08T14:40:58	Let PA confirm. If crowd is massively long and price going up parabolic then get long or stay flat
Trader_Dante	696705158294724613	2016-02-08T14:40:28	Don't make the mistake of thinking: "Crowd is long, crowd is always wrong, therefore must fade the crowd" or you will get run over
Trader_Dante	696704627455238146	2016-02-08T14:38:21	So just be aware of the limitations of broker sentiment
Trader_Dante	696704575689134080	2016-02-08T14:38:09	I suspect the majority are doomsday cunts that are literally not getting out of the position ever unless it goes to zero
Trader_Dante	696704288693882880	2016-02-08T14:37:01	What most don't realise is it's been 92% long for absolutely ages - and from way higher prices than where it trades now
Trader_Dante	696704123757006849	2016-02-08T14:36:21	A quick word on broker client sentiment - with CMC its 92% long Silver and market has shot up masssively 4 days in a row
