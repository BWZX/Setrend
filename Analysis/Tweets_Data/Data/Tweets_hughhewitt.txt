hughhewitt	721349949846351877	2016-04-16T14:50:04	True. "Disappearing delegate" play only works if delegates + alternates all sleep in/get GOP equivalent 2 blue flu 
hughhewitt	721349087975477251	2016-04-16T14:46:39	hughhewitt I was wrong about alternate numbers. GOP has equal #'s. Dems only have a handful per state. I guess because Dems are poorer. ;-)
hughhewitt	721349167696769026	2016-04-16T14:46:58	True but buzz is "pledged"'delegates who don't show up don't vote. You need 1,237, not majority of those present
