SteveKrak	725436558472413184	2016-04-27T21:28:48	richarddeitsch Sure, but that doesn’t legitimize someone in the eyes of voters. Maybe in the media. But voters were way ahead of media.
SteveKrak	725435683913900032	2016-04-27T21:25:19	richarddeitsch Only thing that ever happened on CNN that “legitimized” Trump was the debates. Trump voters couldn’t care less about CNN.

SteveKrak	725418473380143104	2016-04-27T20:16:56	Carly Fiorina was responsible for what may have been Donald Trump’s worst debate moment:

SteveKrak	725377719865741313	2016-04-27T17:34:59	My takeaway from Donald Trump’s foreign policy speech: America must get much less involved, and also much more involved.

SteveKrak	725315698919010304	2016-04-27T13:28:32	2/ Cruz’s problem isn’t head, it’s heart. Personality-wise, does Fiorina complement him? I think someone like Haley would be a better foil.
SteveKrak	725315259469164544	2016-04-27T13:26:48	1/ On Cruz’s VP: Carly Fiorina proved herself to be extremely well-versed on the issues, and a great attacker of both Hillary &amp; Trump. BUT
SteveKrak	725078749754982400	2016-04-26T21:46:59	Ben Carson: “People who are very ambitious…probably should not be president.” Uh, what?

SteveKrak	725040607702425601	2016-04-26T19:15:26	It is unfortunate that the President &amp; more senators have not yet stood up for those who have sacrificed for our country the way Ayotte has.
SteveKrak	725032934692909056	2016-04-26T18:44:56	I like when people who completely disagree can talk like normal people. Good stuff from jeffpearlman... 
SteveKrak	724999460783169537	2016-04-26T16:31:55	Hilarious kind of Trump fan reaction to EWErickson: “Scoreboard” = winning is everything...  
SteveKrak	724975782418735104	2016-04-26T14:57:50	I like how the Beyonce media groupthink swarm has shifted from “perfect display of feminist empowerment" to "HUNT DOWN BECKY AND SHAME HER"
SteveKrak	724973888594026496	2016-04-26T14:50:19	Sure guy who made Facebook videos while drinking wine and talking about pop culture. You’re just like Will Ferrell.

SteveKrak	724947162333761536	2016-04-26T13:04:07	2/ This is not a NeverTrump move though - he wants to get to the convention and leave door open to trade his delegates to Trump for VP.
SteveKrak	724946251481935872	2016-04-26T13:00:29	1/ My theory on Kasich: he knows he’s not going to be president, so he’s going to accumulate delegates while staying out of Cruz’s way.

SteveKrak	724673576616366080	2016-04-25T18:56:59	This is what Beyonce has brought on - some of her hardcore fans are truly awful people:

SteveKrak	724650803483406336	2016-04-25T17:26:29	luckyturner So…only people who are black women are allowed to comment on the work? That’s an interesting precedent to set...
SteveKrak	724616694283390977	2016-04-25T15:10:57	Alternate theory - her firing has absolutely nothing to do with black people. She still doesn't get it.

SteveKrak	724295133563260928	2016-04-24T17:53:11	luckyturner Jay-Z is. And I’d find it very hard to believe Beyonce wants to convey she’s just playing a fictional part with no truth to it.

SteveKrak	724292539914690560	2016-04-24T17:42:52	luckyturner Hip-hop especially is autobiographical, but not necessarily literal. Becky isn’t a real name. But the sentiment is real, right?
SteveKrak	724291406638895104	2016-04-24T17:38:22	luckyturner Doesn’t sound like he was playing a character. Sounds like he regrets that guy he used to be... 
SteveKrak	724290604688019456	2016-04-24T17:35:11	I guess it’s hard to blame the husband when he's the guy behind “Big Pimpin’”… Still, seems hypocritical. Beyonce 
SteveKrak	724286860197912576	2016-04-24T17:20:18	Can someone explain how it’s feminism to go after the rumored other woman and not the guy who did the cheating? Beyonce
SteveKrak	724285818488016896	2016-04-24T17:16:10	Beyonce revealed that Jay-Z cheated on her - rumored to be with Rachel Roy - and all of Beyonce’s fans are mad at Roy? How does that work?

SteveKrak	701766182525751296	2016-02-22T13:51:10	Cheryl707 I noted that. That’s a good strategy. But campaign leaking how getting 2nd place is part of plan = bad. 
SteveKrak	701765252136857601	2016-02-22T13:47:28	HotlineJosh MichaelvdGalien Agreed, but won’t work. I don’t think voters are swayed by fights over the past. They care about tomorrow.
SteveKrak	701764752796553216	2016-02-22T13:45:29	7/ Trump gets it. Cruz attacking Rubio is petty. Rubio quietly being ok with 2nd is weak. It needs to change or Trump is the nominee.
SteveKrak	701764024417923072	2016-02-22T13:42:36	6/ Cruz &amp; Rubio should speak to voters who think “We're so off the rails I don't care what you did yesterday. What are you going to do NOW?”
SteveKrak	701763573387653121	2016-02-22T13:40:48	5/ Rubio spent an entire speech yesterday without mentioning Trump or Cruz. That is the model for success. 
SteveKrak	701763430760382464	2016-02-22T13:40:14	4/ Cruz won Iowa when he stood on the debate stage and acted like the leader of the pack, speaking against bigger foes like Dems or media.
SteveKrak	701763075175641089	2016-02-22T13:38:49	3/ Focusing on nuanced policy differences of the past won’t work. Trump doesn’t - he doesn’t know or care about it. Neither do many voters.
SteveKrak	701762610354466817	2016-02-22T13:36:59	2/ Cruz &amp; Rubio going after each other instead of Hillary, Obama or Trump signal  they’re fighting for 2nd place. Voters don’t want silver.
SteveKrak	701762214701600771	2016-02-22T13:35:24	1/ The idea that Cruz is about to “go to war” with Rubio shows his misunderstanding with the mood of the electorate.
