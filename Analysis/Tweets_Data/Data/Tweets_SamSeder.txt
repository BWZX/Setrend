SamSeder	725894964236963840	2016-04-29T03:50:20	cshirky I'm not arguing that Trump isn't a wild card and relatively she doesn't match up as well- just that your theory is baseless.
SamSeder	725894283249770496	2016-04-29T03:47:38	cshirky I get that but there's plenty of data to suggest Dem voters not angry with establishment. That they are happy w/both candidates.

SamSeder	725893034974523393	2016-04-29T03:42:40	cshirky The above should read "don't necessarily". Absence of evidence to support your theory is not evidence that your theory is correct.
SamSeder	725892367761432577	2016-04-29T03:40:01	That Bernie Sander's degree of success is rooted in an "outsider" status vs the appeal of his policies is a relentless and lazy analysis.
SamSeder	725890701137969152	2016-04-29T03:33:24	cshirky There is also no data to support the idea that Trump's brilliant campaigning appeals to significant s outside the base of the GOP.
SamSeder	725890366705131520	2016-04-29T03:32:04	cshirky you assume that Sander's main appeal was his "outsider" status versus his issue set. Do you data to back up that assumption?
