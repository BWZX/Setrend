TVMoJoe	722618261729374209	2016-04-20T02:49:53	Someone at MSNBC got Bernie's campaign manager to stand in front of a map and do the remaining delegate math.  It... didn't go well for him.

TVMoJoe	720792333533388800	2016-04-15T01:54:18	mikebeckham ...in every state in America. There is a YUUUGE difference between LA/NY and, say, midwest. If $15 is good for, say, Ohio...
TVMoJoe	720792189253472256	2016-04-15T01:53:44	mikebeckham which is why both D candidates are happy to push for 15. One recognizes that it would be disastrous to do it all at once...
TVMoJoe	720791398727831552	2016-04-15T01:50:35	And now Sanders is allowed to wishcast on prisoner releases: Yes, TX and MS are just gonna throw open prison doors. Oy vey. DemDebate
TVMoJoe	720790968631332866	2016-04-15T01:48:53	The DemDebate in one (awesome) cartoon.  
TVMoJoe	720790706067877888	2016-04-15T01:47:50	And then the follow-up to Bernie? A softball to allow him to go after Bill &amp; Hillary. BS.
TVMoJoe	720790530297188356	2016-04-15T01:47:08	Amazing that Sanders, WHO VOTED FOR THE CRIME BILL, doesn't get called out on it... but only Clinton--FLOTUS at the time-- does.

TVMoJoe	720787184949805056	2016-04-15T01:33:51	Minimum wage is perfect example of difference betw them. Forcing all states w/low cost of living to double min wage overnight wld cost jobs.
TVMoJoe	720787097955618816	2016-04-15T01:33:30	Sanders looks so incredibly small and petty right now. Democrats want to raise the minimum wage. GOP doesn't. End of story. DemDebate
TVMoJoe	720785440073236480	2016-04-15T01:26:55	Has anyone commented on Bernie yelling yet?  No?  We still cool on that?  K.

TVMoJoe	720785022345744385	2016-04-15T01:25:15	Sanders can't release his tax returns because Jane files the taxes, and she's campaigning. Doesn't anyone have a spare key?
TVMoJoe	720783275141283841	2016-04-15T01:18:18	Honestly, Clinton's consistently best argument is: If you think I'm too centrist, you must think Obama's too centrist. Which is true.

TVMoJoe	720654527246901249	2016-04-14T16:46:43	I thought I tweeted last week how perfect the MP ep of FOTB was? If not: It was perfect, amazing, awesome.  
TVMoJoe	720651578382770176	2016-04-14T16:35:00	Yup: USA's new "We the Bold" is definitely targeted at millennials. Good backgrounder from Variety_Cynthia 
TVMoJoe	720650448097554433	2016-04-14T16:30:30	Wonder if USA Network was inspired by ShopTheBold...? 
TVMoJoe	720649338070769664	2016-04-14T16:26:05	Schwindter Well, that's my response to the whole campaign (USA's, not Sanders). You don't see an attempt to play on it?
TVMoJoe	720647230630199296	2016-04-14T16:17:43	And while I get that it's a play on "We the People" -- at least I think it is-- it feels grammatically awful. And wrong.
TVMoJoe	720647050442899459	2016-04-14T16:17:00	So: I'sure WeTheBold has been in the works for a long time, but it seems like a really awkward attempt to capture the Bernie ethos. IMO.

TVMoJoe	720643246934728705	2016-04-14T16:01:53	DAvallone johnlevenstein this is why it rings so false when GOP jerks pull the, "Oh, well, rappers use the N word. What's the big deal?"
TVMoJoe	720643035751514112	2016-04-14T16:01:03	DAvallone johnlevenstein I would reject this, completely... but if one wanted to, one could. And we're back to "what's in the heart"
TVMoJoe	720642914003525636	2016-04-14T16:00:34	DAvallone johnlevenstein ...one could make the case it's advancing a stereotype of weak Jewish men &amp; their controlling moms...
TVMoJoe	720642761536311296	2016-04-14T15:59:57	DAvallone johnlevenstein **The Goldbergs has very much tried to play on the universality of a "smother," but if one wanted to be upset...
TVMoJoe	720642558678867970	2016-04-14T15:59:09	DAvallone johnlevenstein "Jewish moms" and "Jews are cheap"? Latter can be used as part of "they're greedy"; other is: The Goldbergs**
TVMoJoe	720642214104174592	2016-04-14T15:57:47	DAvallone johnlevenstein ...in the way that, say, Jews and their moms are (I am Jewish, FWIW). Also: isn't there a diff. b/w...
TVMoJoe	720642001188708353	2016-04-14T15:56:56	DAvallone johnlevenstein I mean: Maybe it is? But: CPT is also used by Asians, Cubans (Cuban People Time), et al. It's not specific...
TVMoJoe	720641707176370177	2016-04-14T15:55:46	DAvallone johnlevenstein I agree with all of this. I also want to know if CPT is something whites have ever used to degrade A-As?
TVMoJoe	720639820192583680	2016-04-14T15:48:16	DAvallone johnlevenstein Then I'd get the outrage. But anyway, I know many disagree. Won't try to litigate it.
TVMoJoe	720639553795567616	2016-04-14T15:47:13	DAvallone johnlevenstein ...and not a shot at POC. To me, that's the HUGE difference. If this were '08 &amp; HRC + X made that joke about O?
TVMoJoe	720639173414129664	2016-04-14T15:45:42	DAvallone johnlevenstein ...but at the participants (Hillary &amp; BdB, cautious politicians)... perplexes me. It was a reference to a cliche
TVMoJoe	720638891884040192	2016-04-14T15:44:35	DAvallone johnlevenstein It was an unforced political error. But comedy writers upset at a satirical riffs aimed NOT at POC....

TVMoJoe	719729628743512064	2016-04-12T03:31:30	Tonight's episode of BetterCallSaul really was amazingly good. Big moments for all four main characters, especially Mike and Kim.
TVMoJoe	719729242531962881	2016-04-12T03:29:57	I love that Mr. del Toro watches BetterCallSaul the night it airs (as do I).

TVMoJoe	719331704641429504	2016-04-11T01:10:17	VegasJournalist ninaturner Because I think HRC is just as fierce and awesome as Ms. Turner thought she was.
TVMoJoe	719331203061448705	2016-04-11T01:08:17	Just watched ROOM (on DVD, like an old man). Not even a year of hype could prepare me for how good it is. Definitely *my* Best Pic of 2015.
TVMoJoe	719330373142859776	2016-04-11T01:05:00	And now Ms. Turner tweets stuff like this. I get/respect being inspired by Sanders. The trashing of HRC? Not so much

TVMoJoe	294305236691087360	2013-01-24T04:46:51	SOS Clinton did her thing today. She was absolutely fierce! It is obvious the Republicans in the Senate cannot handle a strong woman.

TVMoJoe	719190217958133760	2016-04-10T15:48:04	Bernie, MLK--no difference really. (Also, many Hillary supporters --maybe most!--were alive in the 60s ‚úåüèΩÔ∏è)

TVMoJoe	719179372293267456	2016-04-10T15:04:58	The NYT does so much right. Sunday Review is filled with great stuff. Why can't --won't-- the Times do better with its op-Ed columnists?

TVMoJoe	718981705705467904	2016-04-10T01:59:31	This story doesn't mention that Clinton was talking about the crime bill, or that Sanders voted for it. Amazing.

TVMoJoe	718980785307389952	2016-04-10T01:55:51	Didn't think I'd end up misty-eyed at the most recent episodes of Girls AND Last Man on Earth. Almost afraid to watch The Goldbergs now!

TVMoJoe	718979360582029312	2016-04-10T01:50:12	Snoodit Memles of course, bigger issue is: how did this show get so off track and get to the point where she wanted off? Damn shame.
TVMoJoe	718979176917676032	2016-04-10T01:49:28	Snoodit Memles I mean, just film part of the finale now. I know this sounds wildly naive, but...what happened makes zero sense to me
TVMoJoe	718979012484145152	2016-04-10T01:48:49	Snoodit Memles Sorry, don't see how fans will react better to S4 with her dead vs. S4 with hope of happy ending.
TVMoJoe	718978459779772416	2016-04-10T01:46:37	Memles Snoodit btw, it's nice that she wanted off the show. Didn't she have a contract? I'd say: Want to leave? Agree to be in finale
TVMoJoe	718978071684984832	2016-04-10T01:45:04	Exactly: Man has different opinion: Ok. Woman named HRC? "No convictions! Fake!" 
TVMoJoe	718977790775676929	2016-04-10T01:43:57	Memles Snoodit that's a drama based (mostly) in reality, and a show which was a monster hit. I see the point, but...
TVMoJoe	718977453612339200	2016-04-10T01:42:37	Memles Snoodit well, first of all, the show has maybe 13 episodes left at best? I mean, if the X Files can not kill leads...
TVMoJoe	718977009641086981	2016-04-10T01:40:51	Snoodit Memles right: I get why she's off the show. Why must she die? There's no law. Shelley Long didn't die on Cheers...
TVMoJoe	718976833413193728	2016-04-10T01:40:09	Snoodit Memles why not literally put her back in purgatory? Or some other twist?
TVMoJoe	718976564478615552	2016-04-10T01:39:05	Snoodit Memles I agree with all of this, and I totally out of the loop on Sleepy, but: Still don't get the need to kill Abby...

TVMoJoe	718965557018517504	2016-04-10T00:55:21	It *is* awesome that Bernie called out the racial disparity in drug sentencing in 95. But he was also proud to be "tough on crime"
TVMoJoe	718965209537204224	2016-04-10T00:53:58	Bernie, who rails against mass incarceration now, wanted tougher sentences for ALL drug crimes--MORE people in jail

TVMoJoe	718923650305363970	2016-04-09T22:08:49	Memles tvoti ...given the predictable outrage here, I think fans might've given it a chance, esp. if they knew NB truly wanted to go
TVMoJoe	718923484873646080	2016-04-09T22:08:10	Memles tvoti you might have also said, "Joe, you're an older man." ;-) But you're likely right. It's not the 70s. Still...

TVMoJoe	718921599869562880	2016-04-09T22:00:40	That's some serious willpower, Secretary. JuniorsCheeseck is crack by the slice.

TVMoJoe	718920007342645249	2016-04-09T21:54:21	Yup. DWStweets "let" Bernie win recent caucuses by 40-50 points. But she's gonna make sure WY's a tie w/ her tricks

TVMoJoe	718918686933790720	2016-04-09T21:49:06	Even if Sanders ends up +2, his %-age win in an all-white caucus state is way down from his recent wins. I think the HRC base has woken up.
TVMoJoe	718918303297568768	2016-04-09T21:47:35	Even though it's possible Sanders/Clinton will play to a tie, NYT reporting that Sanders "chipped away" at HRC delegate lead. SMH.

TVMoJoe	717895095421304832	2016-04-07T02:01:43	ninatypewriter Nina, how should one respond when one campaign says its rival is "not qualified" to be president?
TVMoJoe	717894504783564800	2016-04-07T01:59:22	Within 24 hours, Sanders campaign has said Hillary's too "ambitious" and "not qualified" to be POTUS. Did Tr--p and Sanders switch bodies?
TVMoJoe	717889993704865792	2016-04-07T01:41:26	that's punchline: Sanders invented a quote to attack Clinton over. (Morning Joe tried/failed to get her to say that) 
TVMoJoe	717893106729820160	2016-04-07T01:53:49	By this standard, Barack Obama is "not qualified" to be president, according to Sen. Sanders. 
TVMoJoe	717892709239754752	2016-04-07T01:52:14	In other words, she didn't proactively praise or legitimize her rival. She didn't attack him. She deflected the Q. 
TVMoJoe	717892249581789185	2016-04-07T01:50:24	BernieTeachers Until 15 minutes ago, I deeply admired Sen. Sanders, even if I didn't support him for POTUS. Now? Just another politician.
TVMoJoe	717892105159315456	2016-04-07T01:49:50	BernieTeachers Well, respectfully, that's the difference b/w Bernie &amp; Hillary. She'd never attack him the way he just did. Shame on him.
TVMoJoe	717891357428219905	2016-04-07T01:46:52	Sanders will likely cite this report from the great agearan to justify its attack. Story, respectfully, misleads: 
TVMoJoe	717889921717895169	2016-04-07T01:41:09	Amen. 
TVMoJoe	717889693556191232	2016-04-07T01:40:15	So not only is Sanders LYING about what Clinton said, he's using a statement she never made to hit HER as unqualified. Shameful.
TVMoJoe	717889348356542464	2016-04-07T01:38:53	Except, HRC did not "quote unquote" says Sanders wasn't qualified. JoeNBC asked 4 times. She didn't take the bait. 
TVMoJoe	717889068135133185	2016-04-07T01:37:46	Four times, JoeNBC asked HRC if Sanders is "qualified to be president." She refused to say he wasn't. Four times. 
TVMoJoe	717886431822110721	2016-04-07T01:27:17	MerrillBarr I'd be shocked if aseitzwald passed on bogus info...
TVMoJoe	717885876534030336	2016-04-07T01:25:05	Congratulations, BernieSanders. That quote will be appearing in Republican attack ads against HillaryClinton across the country.

TVMoJoe	717885476586139650	2016-04-07T01:23:29	Fundraising emails work: Clinton campaign just reminded me of Bernie's team saying HRC's "ambition" might destroy the party. I just gave $19

TVMoJoe	717797159450447873	2016-04-06T19:32:33	johnlevenstein FWIW, I found this a great take: 
TVMoJoe	717740873333743616	2016-04-06T15:48:53	The "ambition" attack on Clinton is old, and undeniably gendered. To the point of parody. Ten years ago. 
TVMoJoe	717747574552158208	2016-04-06T16:15:31	MattMarcotte that was a fundraiser a year ago. Sarah Silverman also gave to HRC!
TVMoJoe	717746365980258308	2016-04-06T16:10:43	(Conversely, were Bey to endorse Sanders, it would be a media hit for HRC, but probably no big impact: Sanders already at Peak Youngs.)
TVMoJoe	717746152834097152	2016-04-06T16:09:52	Legit question: Does Beyonce endorse a candidate before the NY primary? I think she could move some young voters toward HRC if she did.

TVMoJoe	717580622152110080	2016-04-06T05:12:06	mattfwood owillis BeingNOLA nope, it isn't. Not at all. I've no doubt there are some Obama stans who are for Bernie.
TVMoJoe	717579867462590464	2016-04-06T05:09:07	mattfwood owillis BeingNOLA ...from choosing Eric Holder to nominating Garland. And again: that's fine! But it's the choice

TVMoJoe	717579385532841984	2016-04-06T05:07:12	mattfwood owillis BeingNOLA Sanders literally called for Obama to be challenged from within in 2012.
TVMoJoe	717579070540677121	2016-04-06T05:05:57	owillis mattfwood BeingNOLA This was my point. Bernie is the candidate of Obama Failed; HRC is Build on Obama Legacy. Ironic, but...
TVMoJoe	717575844625944577	2016-04-06T04:53:07	mattfwood owillis BeingNOLA even THAT is a huge lift. But it's more doable and responsible.
TVMoJoe	717575705874157569	2016-04-06T04:52:34	mattfwood owillis BeingNOLA this is also why HRC is right on minimum wage. Let blue states lead the way on 15. Push to get 12 as a floor

TVMoJoe	717573754935595010	2016-04-06T04:44:49	mattfwood owillis BeingNOLA and that's fine! But it's also why Bernie is losing, especially among those of us who are Ds
TVMoJoe	717573598702018561	2016-04-06T04:44:12	mattfwood owillis BeingNOLA because: Bernie is running on the theory that Obama failed to bring change. It's the DNA of his campaign

TVMoJoe	717457599281520640	2016-04-05T21:03:16	johnlevenstein She's also a right-wing nut job, IMO, and anti-choice. If Lena Dunham or Kerry Washington want to say,"PH isn't a feminist"?
TVMoJoe	717457201451773952	2016-04-05T21:01:41	johnlevenstein Like, I think Patty Heaton is a strong, kick-ass woman. She may or may not think of herself as a feminist; she likely does.
TVMoJoe	717457074330820608	2016-04-05T21:01:10	johnlevenstein but you know what? Women who are pro-life/anti-choice don't need to be told by the PRESIDENT**, "You're not a feminist."
TVMoJoe	717456745791143937	2016-04-05T20:59:52	johnlevenstein my larger point is, yeah, most people -- most feminists-- think that it's BS to call yourself a feminist but be anti-choice
TVMoJoe	717456538336501760	2016-04-05T20:59:03	johnlevenstein but yeah, I agree- the shorthand is what the shorthand is. Generally, pro-life people aren't pro-choice.
TVMoJoe	717456325635022849	2016-04-05T20:58:12	johnlevenstein not all agree with you on that. 
TVMoJoe	717454828822089728	2016-04-05T20:52:15	johnlevenstein I mean, there are good Catholic Ds who are opposed to abortion -- but pro-choice.
TVMoJoe	717454578879365120	2016-04-05T20:51:15	johnlevenstein expressing understanding of why people *personally* are anti-choice doesn't mean you agree with them, or share their POV
TVMoJoe	717454442476351488	2016-04-05T20:50:43	johnlevenstein What position did she change? She was and is firmly pro-choice. She outlines in detail why she is.
TVMoJoe	717453735094460416	2016-04-05T20:47:54	johnlevenstein but it's not the role of a president to tell people who and who isn't a feminist. HRC doesn't need to prove her bonafides
TVMoJoe	717453406214828032	2016-04-05T20:46:36	johnlevenstein btw: I realize there are many--including HRC supporter Gloria Steinem!--who've said the two ARE mutually exclusive.
TVMoJoe	717453218054189056	2016-04-05T20:45:51	johnlevenstein ....should she have really said, "Sorry, you're not a feminist. I don't want the vote of anyone who disagrees?"
TVMoJoe	717453106053648384	2016-04-05T20:45:24	johnlevenstein ...namely that "pro-choice" is the right thing to be. But she was talking to a pro-life panelist on the View...
TVMoJoe	717453000785047552	2016-04-05T20:44:59	johnlevenstein more to the point, if you listen to the whole HRC interview (which you may have!), she makes it clear where she stands...
TVMoJoe	717452822904590336	2016-04-05T20:44:17	johnlevenstein So now Naomi Wolf isn't a feminist? She's pro-choice, but 20 years ago she argued one could be both: 
TVMoJoe	717445597658152960	2016-04-05T20:15:34	Also: Despite this transcript, pretttttty sure NYDN will end up endorsing Sanders before the D primary-- at least based on past coverage.
TVMoJoe	717445434331955200	2016-04-05T20:14:55	I'd be very curious to hear or see audio/video of the NYDN edit board meeting with Sen. Sanders. Was he snippy, calm, annoyed...?

TVMoJoe	717220285078978564	2016-04-05T05:20:15	BrittanyBronso1 of course not! I'm saying stronger unions lift wages overall, at least in industries which have them.
TVMoJoe	717218956487106562	2016-04-05T05:14:59	BrittanyBronso1 this is also why we need stronger unions.
TVMoJoe	717218640672780288	2016-04-05T05:13:43	BrittanyBronso1 my mom was minimum wage (or under the table) as a waitress much of her career. And many years w/o insurance. I know!
TVMoJoe	717218091554455553	2016-04-05T05:11:32	BrittanyBronso1 ...you and I both know it costs far less to live here than in LA (no state tax for one thing)
TVMoJoe	717217916668801025	2016-04-05T05:10:51	BrittanyBronso1 don't get me wrong: I think someone working at WalMart or McDs deserves 15/hr, whether they live in LA or LV. BUT...
TVMoJoe	717217641719586817	2016-04-05T05:09:45	BrittanyBronso1 ...particularly since CA and NY have gone for 15. GOP will argue--not without merit--that living costs much higher on coast
TVMoJoe	717217404548423680	2016-04-05T05:08:49	BrittanyBronso1 and yes, getting $12 wouldn't be easy or even possible. But it has a better shot of peeling off a few GOP votes.....
TVMoJoe	717217083113795584	2016-04-05T05:07:32	BrittanyBronso1 also: Obama, Reid and Pelosi haven't been able to get $10.10. So it's not like electing Sanders = 15 for all.
TVMoJoe	717216771049185281	2016-04-05T05:06:18	BrittanyBronso1 well, first, a jump from $7.25 to $12 is a huge raise--so it's not as if HRC thinks the floor should stay where it is
TVMoJoe	717214143942692864	2016-04-05T04:55:51	Sen. Sanders needs to a.) See EYE IN THE SKY and b.) Get real.  
TVMoJoe	717211152799891457	2016-04-05T04:43:58	BrittanyBronso1 respectfully, letting big states lead the way on $15 is a better way to make it a reality.
TVMoJoe	717210659713363969	2016-04-05T04:42:01	BrittanyBronso1 Hillary supports a $12 nat'l minimum wage *and* states/cities which can pass Fight for 15.

TVMoJoe	717167247387660292	2016-04-05T01:49:30	And I looked, and behold a FLINT AUTOMOBILE: and his name that sat on him was MICHAEL MOORE, and Hell followed with him.
TVMoJoe	717167013681082370	2016-04-05T01:48:35	And when The DNC had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.
TVMoJoe	717166634121748481	2016-04-05T01:47:04	And I heard a voice say, A measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and # NotAllMen; and he was BROCIALISM

TVMoJoe	717139955454087170	2016-04-05T00:01:03	...and this yesterday. Pretty clear Sanders' delay was about getting based fired up, ready to donate.  
TVMoJoe	717139726822543361	2016-04-05T00:00:09	...and this two days ago... 
TVMoJoe	717139544030642176	2016-04-04T23:59:25	Clinton's spox said this two days ago. Sanders team dragged its feet. 
TVMoJoe	717138373857521664	2016-04-04T23:54:46	1. So much for keeping it about the issues. 2. B3rnie's rallies *are* fundraisers. Get base fired up, ready to give. 
TVMoJoe	717137167995117568	2016-04-04T23:49:59	mikebeckham 8 years? Sanders or Clinton won't have big majorities in Congress, as O did. Also: HRC likely favors single payer, too.
TVMoJoe	717136731292610560	2016-04-04T23:48:15	mikebeckham (for the record, I was Team Obama from Jan 07 on. But HRC has impressed me mightily, esp in small settings.)
TVMoJoe	717136592482119680	2016-04-04T23:47:42	mikebeckham with respect, Mr. Obama is a great leader and one of the (maybe the) best president of my 45 years. Better than BS or HRC.
TVMoJoe	717136340463136769	2016-04-04T23:46:41	This is good. On a related note, have any CNN debates *not* featured a white male over 40 as the main moderator? 
TVMoJoe	717135822986682368	2016-04-04T23:44:38	Hoping this means patkiernan is one of the moderators and we get Weather on the 1s!  
TVMoJoe	717134245513179136	2016-04-04T23:38:22	mikebeckham honestly? Now that we have ACA, US has far bigger issues than single payer. Leaders also multitask + prioritize
TVMoJoe	717133954663383040	2016-04-04T23:37:13	mikebeckham ...and they now want to privatize (i.e., destroy it). This isn't the radical right. It's 40% of the US
TVMoJoe	717133842004348928	2016-04-04T23:36:46	mikebeckham ...we can get a Congress open to it and make it happen. Remember: GOP here fought bitterly vs. social security...
TVMoJoe	717133642774892545	2016-04-04T23:35:58	mikebeckham but if some other states experiment with it, or when millennials and Gen Z vote in off year and 2020 census happens...
TVMoJoe	717133472590999552	2016-04-04T23:35:18	mikebeckham Remember, Vermont--tiny, liberal, Sanders Country-- couldn't get single payer to work there. They tried!
TVMoJoe	717133373261553664	2016-04-04T23:34:54	mikebeckham it says she's not going to tilt at windmills when that sort of change will ONLY happen from the bottom up.
TVMoJoe	717133279040647168	2016-04-04T23:34:32	mikebeckham No argument there. But you have seen how Obama's proposal-- i.e., what the GOP proposed in mid-90s-- is now seen as Communism
TVMoJoe	717133097356156928	2016-04-04T23:33:48	mikebeckham I mean, this is a country where the broadcast networks won't/can't air the word "sh-t." In 2016.
TVMoJoe	717132890149027840	2016-04-04T23:32:59	mikebeckham what she will try to do is to get the ACA to work better. Single payer is very logical. Sadly, the US isn't always logical
TVMoJoe	717132730589323264	2016-04-04T23:32:21	mikebeckham no, she's walked away from a UK or Canadian model, which, sadly, won't happen any time soon under Sanders, Clinton or Jesus.
TVMoJoe	717132507678814210	2016-04-04T23:31:28	mikebeckham that's incremental change I can believe in. Bernie's ultimate success would be joining w/ E. Warren to elect Ds down ballot
TVMoJoe	717132305479761921	2016-04-04T23:30:39	mikebeckham and while GOP congress is far worse than it was in 90s, remember: When they killed her health reform, she got CHP (kids health)
TVMoJoe	717132130933821441	2016-04-04T23:29:58	mikebeckham Incrementally, yes. Dirty secret is GOP knows+likes her; she worked well with them when she was in Senate and as First Lady
TVMoJoe	717131916885897216	2016-04-04T23:29:07	mikebeckham If Sanders somehow got elected, it would be four years of gridlock -- far worse than the last four.
TVMoJoe	717131708789690369	2016-04-04T23:28:17	mikebeckham Didn't say you were! BUT: If US were like UK, I'd be much more interested in a Sanders presidency. He could get stuff done.
TVMoJoe	717131162271940609	2016-04-04T23:26:07	mikebeckham you come from a place with a parliamentary democracy, yes?
TVMoJoe	717130999771955200	2016-04-04T23:25:28	mikebeckham I actually like Sen. Sanders quite a bit. I just (a) think HRC would make a much better POTUS + Sanders would lose in general

TVMoJoe	716107464370888704	2016-04-02T03:38:18	owillis hla254 Kinda like how the GOP can't kill Obamacare or ban abortion and gay people--no matter how much ITS base wants/thinks it can

TVMoJoe	716104891907715073	2016-04-02T03:28:05	hla254 owillis and as for minimum wage, raising min wage at time of escalating unemployment would've been a disaster(and weren't 60 votes)
TVMoJoe	716104441997320192	2016-04-02T03:26:18	hla254 owillis ...and because of 3-4 conservative Ds, we couldn't even get the public option. So you ask why no single payer? THAT is why
TVMoJoe	716104184932610048	2016-04-02T03:25:16	hla254 owillis pardon me for jumping in. When you said the Ds controlled congress, you leave out the fact GOP made 60 the new 50...
TVMoJoe	716090910493122560	2016-04-02T02:32:32	Here's a summary of all of Bernie's positions on "War &amp; Peace" with quotes. 
TVMoJoe	716092875444920321	2016-04-02T02:40:20	US foreign policy is violent and ugly, and he's given no evidence that he has the slightest inclination to changing that. If you even can.
TVMoJoe	716092458170318849	2016-04-02T02:38:41	But I'll stipulate to him being a little less "hawkish" if you want. But how you get to him being an anti-war candidate, I'll never know.
TVMoJoe	716092224144936960	2016-04-02T02:37:45	None of those positions differ measurably from Hillary Clinton's. His first "no" vote for Iraq is basically the only difference.
TVMoJoe	716091723760295936	2016-04-02T02:35:45	Bernie favors keeping US troops in Afghanistan. The war he voted for. It's 15 years later.
TVMoJoe	716091582689124352	2016-04-02T02:35:12	Bernie has also stated that the US should leverage relationships with Qatar and Saudi Arabia to fight ISIS. So...how's that staying out?
TVMoJoe	716091195366248448	2016-04-02T02:33:39	He says the US shouldn't get involved in the "Middle East quagmire." Then he says the US should arm the Peshmurga to fight ISIS.
TVMoJoe	716090701822296065	2016-04-02T02:31:42	...he favors a continued military response toward destroying ISIS, he supports the US' relationship with Israel.

TVMoJoe	715216990156099584	2016-03-30T16:39:53	bgianelli Cruz? Sleazy politician nobody likes. The far right base would love him, but in a general? He'd be destroyed. I think.
TVMoJoe	715216857913905152	2016-03-30T16:39:21	bgianelli Tr--p is a wildcard. I've talked to many real people, people who are not evil or mean or (clear) bigots. They like him!
TVMoJoe	715216726036623360	2016-03-30T16:38:50	bgianelli but this is also my point (maybe not made clear): I think HRC has a slightly better chance of beating Cruz than Tr--p!
TVMoJoe	715216588874457088	2016-03-30T16:38:17	bgianelli I do think there's some fakery involved with Cruz, too. He wants power more than anything, just like Tr--p
TVMoJoe	715216371932528641	2016-03-30T16:37:25	bgianelli Both Tr--p and Cruz would put equally awful people on the court. It's why Rs cannot win this election [cough, Susan Sarandon[
TVMoJoe	715216075957227526	2016-03-30T16:36:15	.bgianelli on policy, I agree. I totally agree. But: POTUS' most unchecked power is on foreign policy+war. Imagine him "leading" the world.
TVMoJoe	715215713510629376	2016-03-30T16:34:48	Is it a bit ridiculous? Sure. But Tr--p is a *lot* ridiculous.  
TVMoJoe	715215566768701442	2016-03-30T16:34:13	I'm making the point Tr--p is obscene. I try to keep it clean on Twitter. More than that, it's a form of protest 
TVMoJoe	715215070037315585	2016-03-30T16:32:15	10. The final reason: I just can't take 6 months of worrying that Tr--p might be president...he'd probably lose, but... what if he didn't?
TVMoJoe	715214804122611712	2016-03-30T16:31:12	9. Also, as horrible and dangerous as Cruz would be as president, if an R does win in Nov., I'd still rather take my chances with him
TVMoJoe	715214534894493696	2016-03-30T16:30:07	8. Plus, Cruz can't run to the left of HRC on trade or finance (even if Tr--p isn't really against free trade or for finance reform)
TVMoJoe	715214260675039233	2016-03-30T16:29:02	7. Cruz offers the chance for Ds to slay the beast. A diehard conservative driven to defeat might break the fever,force compromise (or not!)
TVMoJoe	715213971901407233	2016-03-30T16:27:53	6. Also, GOP in DC wouldn't feel humbled by his loss in November. They'd claim him to be an outlier-- "he wasn't really a conservative."
TVMoJoe	715213505314443264	2016-03-30T16:26:02	5. Plus, he would dominate the fall campaign, spreading his toxicity even further than he already has. US rep would take a hit, even in loss
TVMoJoe	715213263177256961	2016-03-30T16:25:04	4. But I really do think Tr--p would bring out scores of non-voters, and there's the chance of a radical makeover to make him palatable
TVMoJoe	715212859056107520	2016-03-30T16:23:28	3. On the surface, yeah: Tr--p offers chance of an epic D victory by either HRC or Sanders. GOP elites, esp. in blue states, might vote D
TVMoJoe	715212397871390722	2016-03-30T16:21:38	2. (This may be conventional wisdom, and I'm not offering this as some "whoa!" opinion. Just thinking out loud.)
TVMoJoe	715212234960412672	2016-03-30T16:20:59	1. The more I think about it , the more I think Ds should be rooting for Cruz to win the GOP nomination, rather than Tr--p

TVMoJoe	712838380883542016	2016-03-24T03:08:08	But interviewing Hewitt, without any opposing view at same time, is basically Fox News BS, transferred to CNN.
TVMoJoe	712838092613267456	2016-03-24T03:06:59	I mean, it's one thing to have Hewitt on as a commentator on election nights. It's horrible, but given how far right GOP is, I get it.
TVMoJoe	712837799439781888	2016-03-24T03:05:49	CNN now has Hugh Hewitt on spouting anti-HRC propaganda, "no go zone" nonsense  in discussion about terrorism with Don Lemon. Stunning.

TVMoJoe	712445150849425408	2016-03-23T01:05:35	I think this is a very good guess.  
TVMoJoe	712445045769568257	2016-03-23T01:05:10	7. Absent such specificity, it came off as NNN editorializing. I expect better from a quality broadcast such as NBC Nightly News. /end
TVMoJoe	712444753854357504	2016-03-23T01:04:00	6. Whatever the reason, NNN failed by not specifically stating who the "some" were and how they "objected"
TVMoJoe	712444447179472896	2016-03-23T01:02:47	5. Or did a producer feel the Twitter nontroversy over Obama's "handling" needed to be in the broadcast, perhaps over Mitchell's objection?
TVMoJoe	712443981297111040	2016-03-23T01:00:56	4. All of which makes me wonder: Why the LesterHoltNBC comment about "some" objecting? As editor of NNN, did he feel Mitchell erred?
TVMoJoe	712443566824378369	2016-03-23T00:59:17	3. Instead, she showed what POTUS did today, including his comments and briefings. Very straightforward, fair report.
TVMoJoe	712443337471463424	2016-03-23T00:58:22	2. But mitchellreports didn't address any such objections in her story (wisely, IMO, because they're partisan noise).
TVMoJoe	712443016041005057	2016-03-23T00:57:06	1. So LesterHoltNBC teased, then intro'd a mitchellreports story by saying POTUS continuing Cuba visit did "not sit well with some"
TVMoJoe	712436921893412864	2016-03-23T00:32:53	OfficialChaunce which makes life harder for male comedy writers who aren't BBs, like secunda
TVMoJoe	712436198816374784	2016-03-23T00:30:00	Also, by this logic, President Bush probably shouldn't have smiled in public a single day after invading Iraq 
TVMoJoe	712435925029027840	2016-03-23T00:28:55	I know it's symbolic but should Phil Shuman be tweeting links to meaningless stories today?

TVMoJoe	710862651757187072	2016-03-18T16:17:18	19. But don't beat yourself up, Mr. Brooks, for overestimating the intelligence  of the masses. Instead, do a better job educating them.
TVMoJoe	710862251029172225	2016-03-18T16:15:42	18. They're citizens. Their voices count. They're not all bad people.
TVMoJoe	710861920799068160	2016-03-18T16:14:23	17. But I don't believe folks who normally can't be bothered to pay attention, but then get motivated by a demagogue, deserve "respect"
TVMoJoe	710861226465570816	2016-03-18T16:11:38	16. I also don't think everyone who "supports" Tr--p is some awful human, or racist, or stupid. (Well, they're sort of stupid.)
TVMoJoe	710861029199052800	2016-03-18T16:10:51	15. And as I said earlier, I don't believe most who embrace Tr--p have done so b/c they've been left out (even if they have been!)
TVMoJoe	710860915453759488	2016-03-18T16:10:24	14. Tens of millions have been left out of this economy, but they haven't embraced something a vile as Tr--p.
TVMoJoe	710860693801553925	2016-03-18T16:09:31	13. Anyway, for Brooks to argue that these voters "deserve respect" because they've been "left out of this economy" is, respectfully, wrong
TVMoJoe	710858575011123200	2016-03-18T16:01:06	12. Tr--p isn't so much speaking for the voiceless as he is catching the attention of those bored/uninterested by the System.
TVMoJoe	710858088392175616	2016-03-18T15:59:10	11. I'd argue the same is true with politics. Bernie gets the kids, sure, but he's getting tons of disaffected far leftists, too (Naderites)
TVMoJoe	710857800994267136	2016-03-18T15:58:01	10. Networks are so busy producing one kind of sitcom/drama/reality show, they forget about the millions who want Y or Z instead of X

TVMoJoe	710856782759927808	2016-03-18T15:53:58	7. They rush to Tr--p because he's plain spoken, direct and replaces DC doubletalk with his own, much more entertaining brand of doubletalk
TVMoJoe	710856425530990592	2016-03-18T15:52:33	6. If anything, they're a Coalition of the Cranky-- people who are as tired of GOP talking points as much as they loathe Obama.

TVMoJoe	710855034032918528	2016-03-18T15:47:01	4. Conditioned by nearly a decade of Fox News AND old school GOP pundits (like Brooks**) that Obama is evil, they LOVE Tr--p's O-bashing
TVMoJoe	710854787097432064	2016-03-18T15:46:02	3. But I've talked to many actual Tr--p supporters who are simply older, white GOP folks who love him simply because he's "fearless"
TVMoJoe	710854267595165697	2016-03-18T15:43:59	2. I've no doubt some of his support comes from (white) people who are working harder/getting paid less. But, ahem: That's most of America

TVMoJoe	710520368662847488	2016-03-17T17:37:11	This is a big deal: Warner Bros. TV is giving stacking rights to ABC on any new series launched on ABC over next 2 seasons.

TVMoJoe	709844632864030721	2016-03-15T20:52:03	In 2008, Clinton won OH, TX, RI in March; PA in April; KY, WV, IN in May. Media all but said it was over for her:

TVMoJoe	709796470313000960	2016-03-15T17:40:40	But Sanders, more than any candidate I can recall, has passed through half of the primaries with virtually no negative attention.
TVMoJoe	709796196924006400	2016-03-15T17:39:35	Tr--p was built by the media; Sanders built his campaign from the grassroots and social media. That's a huge blemish for MSM.
TVMoJoe	709795823119302656	2016-03-15T17:38:06	So let's be clear: Tr--p has benefited the most from free media, more than anyone ever has (both in the past year and the past decade)
TVMoJoe	709795520206774272	2016-03-15T17:36:54	For more on the Sanders smear against Clinton in Polk, read this. Long, wonky but dispassionate and honest:  
TVMoJoe	709795193763987460	2016-03-15T17:35:36	Plus, Sanders' campaign hasn't been held to account for falsely spreading rumors about HRC trying to "steal" IA's Polk County convention.
TVMoJoe	709794994068959233	2016-03-15T17:34:48	Meanwhile, Sanders, who claims to have "never run a negative ad in my life," has for months been implying HRC is part of a "rigged economy"
TVMoJoe	709794850586042368	2016-03-15T17:34:14	Sanders? HRC raises legit points about auto bailout and his desire to destroy ACA in favor of Sanderscare-- and she's slammed for it.
TVMoJoe	709794515196850176	2016-03-15T17:32:54	But Tr--p has gotten plenty of negativity in the past month, both from PACs, media and full weight of establishment.
TVMoJoe	709794317468958721	2016-03-15T17:32:07	Obviously, the biggest sin this election has been the media's massive investment in Tr--p. Free air time, lack of early scrutiny...

TVMoJoe	709792267104423936	2016-03-15T17:23:58	Sure-- Sanders was ignored by MSM for much of 2015. But that works to his benefit. Any coverage he got was either positive or "underdog."
TVMoJoe	709792134807728128	2016-03-15T17:23:26	Has there ever been a major party presidential candidate who's gotten such a free pass from the media as Sanders?

TVMoJoe	709409543600545792	2016-03-14T16:03:10	CBS should hire Harvey to do a Sunday show in the fall. He could have a different hit for a different network in every quarter!
TVMoJoe	709409268961648640	2016-03-14T16:02:04	Between LittleBigShots and CelebrityFamilyFeud, Steve Harvey is owning Sundays at 8 with unscripted. Echoes of Ed Sullivan.
TVMoJoe	709409062518022144	2016-03-14T16:01:15	B_Southward maybe! Don't know how many episodes they can produce. Harvey's also got Family Feud.
TVMoJoe	709408934520434688	2016-03-14T16:00:44	MrAlanSpencer nah. It's a talent show, not a game show. You can't find that many cute kids + produce that many episodes.

TVMoJoe	709403260407263232	2016-03-14T15:38:12	How big is LittleBigShots? So big that a rerun of last week's preview drew 7.6M viewers &amp; beat every scripted show on b'cast Sunday.
TVMoJoe	709403028030300160	2016-03-14T15:37:16	How big is LittleBigShots? So big, its audience of 14.8M nearly matches the combined audience for all six shows on Fox Sunday (15.1M)
TVMoJoe	709401524988825604	2016-03-14T15:31:18	But for now, LBS is  giving Carmichael the best possible platform to build an audience.
TVMoJoe	709401309925879808	2016-03-14T15:30:26	Looking forward, long-term: If LBS stays big, NBC will probably want to find something (reality/drama/comedy) that's a better fit at 9...
TVMoJoe	709401077565640704	2016-03-14T15:29:31	On one level, yes-- there was huge erosion between LBS &amp; Carmichael. But this isn't 2005 (and TWD, airing at 9, is TV's biggest hit)
TVMoJoe	709400680704770048	2016-03-14T15:27:56	Solid start for TheCarmichaelShow: Boosted by LBS, premiere notched 6.7M viewers + 1.5 A18-49. Ep 2: 4.6M + 1.1.

TVMoJoe	709225319555698689	2016-03-14T03:51:07	In fairness, Greenwald &amp; Co. hate Obama nearly as much as Hillary. So this no doubt pissed them off, too.

TVMoJoe	707307015710740480	2016-03-08T20:48:28	So....maybe TBS should premiere FullFrontal Saturdays at 11? TBBT is a much bigger lead-in. Competition lighter. And nice lead-in to SNL.
TVMoJoe	707306770062913536	2016-03-08T20:47:29	The difference? Lead-in. On Monday, Family Guy rerun on TBS did 805K at 10 p.m. On Saturday, BBT rerun "Scavenger Vortex" notched 2.3M

TVMoJoe	707276428774014977	2016-03-08T18:46:55	12. Final note/disclosure: VinylHBO was one of my most highly anticipated shows of 2016. I've yet to make it through the pilot.
TVMoJoe	707276180915822592	2016-03-08T18:45:56	11. (Of course, nothing on CW or Fox of late has cost $30M for a pilot. So there's that).
TVMoJoe	707276085843496960	2016-03-08T18:45:34	10. But people *are* (were) sampling it. More people watched VinylHBO within a week than some CW and Fox shows.
TVMoJoe	707275789511708673	2016-03-08T18:44:23	9. This is not to suggest VinylHBO is some runaway hit. It's not. It's a clear disappointment, based on auspices and budget.
TVMoJoe	707275662789218305	2016-03-08T18:43:53	8. HBO also aired Vinyl many times in daytime, and on its multiplex channels. HBO VOD adds some more (although not that many more).
TVMoJoe	707275379531067393	2016-03-08T18:42:45	7. Within a week, that initial audience of barely 750K nearly tripled, to 2.9M viewers-- just from HBO's linear showings in primetime+DVR
TVMoJoe	707274844727947264	2016-03-08T18:40:38	6. HBO then ran the Vinyl pilot four more times in primetime over the next week. Those 4 showings added another 955K viewers.
TVMoJoe	707274281021865984	2016-03-08T18:38:23	5. But within 12 hours, HBO reran Vinyl two more times. Add up everyone who watched all 3 airings within a week? Already up to 1.92M.
TVMoJoe	707273559496732673	2016-03-08T18:35:31	4. So let's look at a recent ep Vinyl-- the 2/14 premiere. It opened with 764K same-day viewers for the 2-hour premiere. Not good, Bob!
TVMoJoe	707270902103220225	2016-03-08T18:24:58	3. This helps explain why HBO puts out numbers saying GameofThrones reaches nearly 20M per ep, even if same-day is 1/3 that.
TVMoJoe	707270506789994496	2016-03-08T18:23:23	2. But HBO's model, like Netflix's, allows for audiences to watch when they want. And in addition to VOD, HBO reruns shows often in a week.
TVMoJoe	707270217785708544	2016-03-08T18:22:15	1. As I've noted before, VinylHBO isn't attracting a lot of urgent Sunday at 9 viewership. Episodes drawing about 600K the night they air.
