raju	720018571003305985	2016-04-12T22:39:39	moorehn my point simply is i would love a media company to tell me we will ONLY do 50% more revenue yoy. that is the only data in FT story.
raju	720016207731146752	2016-04-12T22:30:15	moorehn that is a different argument you are making then about your belief in their abilities. I don't have any data to comment on that
raju	720015200523522049	2016-04-12T22:26:15	moorehn they cut their 2016 projection to about 50% yoy revenue growth. Would love to see such post-cuts projections at most media cos

raju	720010259167887360	2016-04-12T22:06:37	moorehn i have no idea about their costs so don't know. I would, however, love any digital media biz that can show me 50% revenue growth
raju	720007297288835072	2016-04-12T21:54:51	Wish that was automatically the case. 
raju	720006899509370880	2016-04-12T21:53:16	Actually others should try to get to 50% growth in revenue first, before saying buzzfeed "can't do it," perhaps?
