KurtWagner8	697516636601917440	2016-02-10T20:25:00	harshit10101 I understand. By coming out and sharing a statement on the record with the press, I considered that public

KurtWagner8	697144759345786880	2016-02-09T19:47:17	pcjm08 hereandnow so no teens can use any online communication? I understand the concern but that doesn't feel plausible
KurtWagner8	697135152950935552	2016-02-09T19:09:07	Love this. nkulw with an inspired review of The Crunchies   
KurtWagner8	697130825733701632	2016-02-09T18:51:55	psMertens yeah tomorrow could be rough
KurtWagner8	697127605107949568	2016-02-09T18:39:07	psMertens are you saying people will say it tomorrow or that I mentioned it in my article. Hard to ignore if it's the latter.
KurtWagner8	697125287260127232	2016-02-09T18:29:55	psMertens did they? It's not even a week old :)
KurtWagner8	697123901885673472	2016-02-09T18:24:24	Twitter has very important earnings tomorrow. Here's a preview for those interested  
KurtWagner8	697122226760323073	2016-02-09T18:17:45	techcoolness I don't think that implies overreaction. Just that on the surface, having free internet seems good until you look at details
KurtWagner8	696941234166853632	2016-02-09T06:18:33	Clivebarron where's the error?
KurtWagner8	696917482901143554	2016-02-09T04:44:10	tmcmill81 peach huh?
KurtWagner8	696917235646877696	2016-02-09T04:43:11	tmcmill81 bmmusser its in there. They hadn't shared that data when the story pubbed but it's in there now
KurtWagner8	696902042279784449	2016-02-09T03:42:49	tmcmill81 bmmusser definitely new strategy
KurtWagner8	696901927674597377	2016-02-09T03:42:22	bmmusser 16mm = US only. 27mm = global + 3 additional hours of pre game tweets. All in the story
KurtWagner8	696899892589916160	2016-02-09T03:34:16	bblack3113 tmcmill81 adding three hours to the measurement window adds a lot more tweets to the total
KurtWagner8	696899667615989761	2016-02-09T03:33:23	bmmusser Recode didn't include any off-Twitter impressions last year. Makes a bit difference. Aren't comparing apples to apples
KurtWagner8	696898355343990784	2016-02-09T03:28:10	tmcmill81 bblack3113 Twitter measured differently this year for both impressions and total tweets. There's a reason
KurtWagner8	696897488129622016	2016-02-09T03:24:43	tmcmill81 @Fake_Buffett go look at numbers twitter reported in the story. Fewer tweets in 3 more hours of time. In line with Nielsen trend
KurtWagner8	696888977098305537	2016-02-09T02:50:54	CarterMansbach 16.9mm = US only. 27mm = global + 3+ hours of before/after game tweets than last year when they reported 28.4mm. So less.
KurtWagner8	696888245615878144	2016-02-09T02:47:59	@Fake_Buffett different window this year than last. Includes 3+ hours before the game unlike last year
KurtWagner8	696847902996430848	2016-02-09T00:07:41	@Fake_Buffett agree the game was a dud. 40%+ though is a big drop off
KurtWagner8	696843420602601473	2016-02-08T23:49:52	Where did everyone post their hottake this year?

KurtWagner8	695759122260578304	2016-02-06T00:01:15	@christiancadeo sure. I still feel like my Twitter interactions often feel more personal than most of my LI ones
KurtWagner8	695758947114876928	2016-02-06T00:00:34	clevelandsaplum yep
KurtWagner8	695758900826501122	2016-02-06T00:00:23	garykarr it's all personal preference!
KurtWagner8	695758789123813376	2016-02-05T23:59:56	mwolpin fair. All so dependent on personal preference
KurtWagner8	695758636295942144	2016-02-05T23:59:20	psMertens no kidding. You need better friends! :)
KurtWagner8	695755998150029313	2016-02-05T23:48:51	garykarr more the latter. These five are the biggest for me
