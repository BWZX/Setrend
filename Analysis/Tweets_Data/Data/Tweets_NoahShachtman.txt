NoahShachtman	713797949738889216	2016-03-26T18:41:07	2. Trump has a pretty clear albeit blinkered worldview, and it's the one thomaswright08 elucidated months ago.

NoahShachtman	713800230303580162	2016-03-26T18:50:11	6. Trump also thinks that foreign affairs is all about tactical surprise and dealmaking. Concepts like credible commitment are alien to him.
NoahShachtman	713798905604009984	2016-03-26T18:44:55	4. In the interview, Trump shows he knows nothing about cyber, nothing about how economic sanctions work, and knows nothing about China.
