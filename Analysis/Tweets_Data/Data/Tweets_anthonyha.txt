anthonyha	683383456940830721	2016-01-02T20:24:47	minimaxir Just the once. Then they never asked me back.
anthonyha	683381762823745536	2016-01-02T20:18:03	Happy birthday to my favorite writer 
anthonyha	683365048522289153	2016-01-02T19:11:38	Just made my first meal from purplecarrotxo 
anthonyha	682651000885407754	2015-12-31T19:54:16	mlaffs But again, I was fine paying a premium to get same-day tix for a show that‚Äôs ostensibly sold out till July!  sarahlane alex
anthonyha	682650866042712064	2015-12-31T19:53:44	mlaffs Apparently At The Booth app now just points to TKTS, which doesn‚Äôt have Hamilton tix? sarahlane alex AtTheBooth
anthonyha	682648482612703233	2015-12-31T19:44:15	mlaffs sarahlane alex Ha well those *were* the same-day deals the last time I looked. But yeah, I imagine it varies depending on the day!
anthonyha	682645652090806272	2015-12-31T19:33:01	selviano fmanjoo farhad‚Äôs next beard 
anthonyha	682643905750417410	2015-12-31T19:26:04	fmanjoo Although! The later Star Wars movies are a weird mix of crass commercialism and admirable/boring indifference to audience desires.
anthonyha	682643259449982977	2015-12-31T19:23:30	fmanjoo Yeah, I guess Lucas still wants to see himself as an indie maverick, when his record on that post-1977 is pretty much nonexistent.
anthonyha	682642243052679168	2015-12-31T19:19:28	fmanjoo Fair, though didn‚Äôt he also say something about Hollywood taking the wrong examples from SW? So he kinda, sorta acknowledged it
anthonyha	682641433833021440	2015-12-31T19:16:15	He doesn‚Äôt love the new movie, he has mixed feelings about Star Wars‚Äô legacy, he acknowledges that it‚Äôs not his baby anymore, ok, fine.
anthonyha	682641381634879488	2015-12-31T19:16:02	IDK, am I the only one who thinks that aside from the (very) dumb ‚Äúwhite slaver‚Äù comment, that George Lucas interview was ‚Ä¶ fine?
anthonyha	682635583944933376	2015-12-31T18:53:00	JackSmithIV eringriffith Also they make a big deal about how fancy the pizza is but that‚Äôs basically half the pizza places in the Mission

anthonyha	682340145308123138	2015-12-30T23:19:02	FutureBoy ThisIsFusion A fantasy (like Star Wars or LOTR) can still be an anti-tech allegory. I think that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre getting at.
