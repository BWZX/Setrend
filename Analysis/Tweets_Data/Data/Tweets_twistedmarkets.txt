twistedmarkets	692926300084924416	2016-01-29T04:24:38	stockpreneur2_0 yep!  If I was a futes trader, I'd take 1/4 here for profit. Stops at 1/4 1892, then last 1/2 at entry or 1860

twistedmarkets	692925542329401345	2016-01-29T04:21:37	chrisbowers hence me saying if I could short the futures I would.  I said to short over 1900 on SP futures and now we are .75% off that
twistedmarkets	692925279371657217	2016-01-29T04:20:35	chrisbowers huge negative for the markets.  Shows central banks can't handle the problem.  Recession more likely

twistedmarkets	692922287457243136	2016-01-29T04:08:41	stockpreneur2_0 yeah, that was a dumb move in the futes. Easy short there.  No guarantees but this market is bad.

twistedmarkets	692774730227560448	2016-01-28T18:22:21	both analogs would argue that deploying long capital here would be a mistake.  Both years also ended as a negative year.  How lovely...

twistedmarkets	692712005321433088	2016-01-28T14:13:06	This back and forth is nuts.  If oil was really the reason we are down, we should be over 1950 now.  This is messy

twistedmarkets	692103027763720192	2016-01-26T21:53:15	Closing close to the highs is bullish, but yesterday we closed on the lows (bearish).  No direction after a down move is bearish though

twistedmarkets	691683938977251328	2016-01-25T18:07:56	UdallTechStrat listen Estimize chrisbowers check this out tonight.
twistedmarkets	691680771178795008	2016-01-25T17:55:21	chrisbowers energy is ruling the markets right now, so tech is a bit of an afterthought.  I would say minimal right now
twistedmarkets	691680459625881600	2016-01-25T17:54:07	chrisbowers but my buddy UdallTechStrat is the man there.  Sean can you help out my friend Chris?
twistedmarkets	691680312552652800	2016-01-25T17:53:31	chrisbowers can't figure out those companies.  Im horrible at analyzing tech stocks.  It's my biggest weakness in analysis.
twistedmarkets	691678183964315648	2016-01-25T17:45:04	So far we recovered yesterday's low.  If we stay above that low today, it's a win for the Bulls.  Trend rules after that.
twistedmarkets	691614443378053120	2016-01-25T13:31:47	I will be most delighted when being nice on purpose becomes the trendy thing .... Right now, being nasty seems to be all the rage
twistedmarkets	691670118531751937	2016-01-25T17:13:01	Banks and small caps... So bad
twistedmarkets	691663702420926464	2016-01-25T16:47:31	Banks look so bad right now
twistedmarkets	691646221220380672	2016-01-25T15:38:03	Financials still weak out of the gate
twistedmarkets	691629747021881344	2016-01-25T14:32:36	mpk62 exactly!
twistedmarkets	691506473168310272	2016-01-25T06:22:45	JeremyKnull DrStevenLin it's because I don't argue with idiots.
twistedmarkets	691501465223860224	2016-01-25T06:02:51	JeremyKnull SenSanders it's already too much.  You are missing the whole freaking point!  Turn on your brain!
twistedmarkets	691501075296202752	2016-01-25T06:01:18	JeremyKnull SenSanders I want you to be informed.  Money doesn't grow on trees and increased taxes slow the economy.  Ask a professor
twistedmarkets	691500598055731201	2016-01-25T05:59:24	JeremyKnull SenSanders how about you spend some time understanding economics.  That's our disagreement.
twistedmarkets	691500331088236545	2016-01-25T05:58:21	JeremyKnull SenSanders read what you just said.  Free healthcare is an entitlement and it costs money.  Try using your brain
twistedmarkets	691500140188823552	2016-01-25T05:57:35	JeremyKnull SenSanders please keep posting pictures.  It's laughable when it's all conjecture.
twistedmarkets	691499508325220353	2016-01-25T05:55:04	JeremyKnull SenSanders his party perpetuated it under the guise of reduction.
twistedmarkets	691499269648351233	2016-01-25T05:54:07	JeremyKnull SenSanders ACA was supposed to decrease health costs too.  Its all BS.
twistedmarkets	691498816030179328	2016-01-25T05:52:19	JeremyKnull SenSanders money doesn't grow on trees and increasing taxes slows the already feeble economy.  Be realistic.

twistedmarkets	691485292239269888	2016-01-25T04:58:35	SenSanders so spend all their money on social programs and unmanageable debt?  Are you serious?  You think about the kids!

twistedmarkets	691420669456707585	2016-01-25T00:41:48	Remember we have only retraced 36% ish.  First decent fib would be 191.12ish.  Very close.  If it fails, horrible for the market

twistedmarkets	690634847111372800	2016-01-22T20:39:13	S0123456789123 not looking there.  China has major structural probs.  im not touching international stuff.the S&amp;P is just trading too well
twistedmarkets	690633704167763968	2016-01-22T20:34:41	Look at the internals.  So far it's an Energy oversold bounce. It's great, but we need rotation into the banks.
twistedmarkets	690633248762757120	2016-01-22T20:32:52	NYMOVIX yes, bounces are fast and furious.  Momo can carry us higher, but that's only little left in the tank.Need back and fill for health

twistedmarkets	690627609701396480	2016-01-22T20:10:28	High yields up 3% since i said buy them on Weds.  Converts up 5% via the vehicle I use.  Not bad bond trades.  $$$$
twistedmarkets	690627022549217283	2016-01-22T20:08:08	Also the long bond needs to fall more.  Hat tip NYMOVIX .  Still not out of the woods.  "Cautiously optimistic". Love that cheesy phrase
twistedmarkets	690626595619385344	2016-01-22T20:06:26	Bearish case is still banks and small caps not leading.  They need to take over soon or the bounce is just that.  Money made either way

twistedmarkets	690624126218739712	2016-01-22T19:56:37	Such a bad analogy, if you liked it at 2100, then you would be dishonest to say it's dangerous to buy at 1850.

twistedmarkets	690499938892005376	2016-01-22T11:43:08	Small caps bottoming first, oil bottoming.  Then yesterday long bonds coming in and bullish sectors leading. XTN, XRT, XLE.
twistedmarkets	690499623685857280	2016-01-22T11:41:53	But I don't trade gut feels, I trade setups.  Wednesday's reversal had all the makings of a reversal trade setup.Sectors, CEF NAV discounts+
twistedmarkets	690499294542073856	2016-01-22T11:40:35	My gut feel is that we did a lot of damage with two waterfalls in 6 months.  Not normal in bull markets, nor is NYMO -130 we saw Wednesday
twistedmarkets	690498976366333952	2016-01-22T11:39:19	Yes, this could be more than an oversold bounce.  Open mind to all possibilities.  I don't make predictions, i trade what I see
twistedmarkets	690498736968065025	2016-01-22T11:38:22	Lack of participation in banks yesterday is concerning and if this is to be more than an oversold bounce, they need to join the party

twistedmarkets	690325477194502145	2016-01-22T00:09:54	NickNipclose stilespaul1 to say it's not an argument is absurd.  My healthcare costs have gone up 150% since ACA.

twistedmarkets	685120085539684354	2016-01-07T15:25:31	Still no confirmation by the way, still waiting.  If tomorrow opens like this, I will buy and go fishing
twistedmarkets	685119853741527040	2016-01-07T15:24:36	NYMO -60, now that's more like it

twistedmarkets	684889742924627969	2016-01-07T00:10:14	An open below today's low would be ideal, then a recapture of that low. As griffinmcgee would say $$💃💃

twistedmarkets	681963449950179329	2015-12-29T22:22:11	@wolfhonest davebudge Yep, pick your poison.  If oil stays below $50 through the first 6 months, WNR should give 30-40% upside, IMO
twistedmarkets	681960481062440960	2015-12-29T22:10:23	Reversal in WNR confirmed today, for those that care.

twistedmarkets	681929827826282496	2015-12-29T20:08:35	CJMendes he is a reporter needing to say something.  Not an analyst.
twistedmarkets	681927212996509696	2015-12-29T19:58:11	FYI it's dove season, don't expect too many tweets on the open anytime soon.  priorities
twistedmarkets	681910783031181312	2015-12-29T18:52:54	NACMtrader17 I use both.  And I feel they are for different time frames, generally.  there are outliers on both sides.  AMZN, MSFT, etc...
twistedmarkets	681909609351651328	2015-12-29T18:48:14	NACMtrader17 lol!  Peak TA?!?!
twistedmarkets	681904642762997761	2015-12-29T18:28:30	Worried about a 3.8% divi?  It's only a 28% payout ratio.  It could pay 2X that and still be ok. WNR.
twistedmarkets	681903744653463552	2015-12-29T18:24:56	daytrend davebudge technicals need confirming but the fundamentals are there.  Technicals are very close, IMO
