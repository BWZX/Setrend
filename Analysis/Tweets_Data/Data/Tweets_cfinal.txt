cfinal	685189376465305600	2016-01-07T20:00:52	LongShortTrader agreed...N=perhaps the algos replace the humans directly...and now the process takes on a new form entirely (algovalgo)
cfinal	685188584127606784	2016-01-07T19:57:43	LongShortTrader as human traders still facing this mkt we need to take that into account and adjust our expectations
cfinal	685188440695156736	2016-01-07T19:57:09	LongShortTrader larger point is yes mkts are a microcosm of human behaviour, but less so now than in the past in the shorter term...and
cfinal	685187747880038400	2016-01-07T19:54:23	LongShortTrader of course...but my point is that they are now once removed...as such the responses in the mkt are increasingly mechanical
cfinal	685187368060588032	2016-01-07T19:52:53	LongShortTrader so as a trader I am now up against a machine instead of a human directly...that once removed aspect changes the mkt a lot
cfinal	685187224959356929	2016-01-07T19:52:19	LongShortTrader definitely...but the responses are(IMO) not as emotionally driven in the shorter term... 1/2
cfinal	685186739745456128	2016-01-07T19:50:23	LongShortTrader so the response function of the mkt is being changed indefinitely...so...adapt or die I suppose
cfinal	685186572724088835	2016-01-07T19:49:43	LongShortTrader agree but with the caveat that (as you know) human participation in the mkt is being replaced by machine participation 1/2
