jdportes	704703933399359488	2016-03-01T16:24:45	AdamPerkinsPhD StrongerInNos eg "+ve linear association between welfare state reliance and reproduction".  Data doesn't show that.
jdportes	704703618281283585	2016-03-01T16:23:30	AdamPerkinsPhD Start with last 3 sentences of passage highlighted by StrongerInNos All unconditional, all unsupported by data.
jdportes	704698558503591936	2016-03-01T16:03:23	AdamPerkinsPhD StrongerInNos Didn't say your whole book was false. Merely that you should correct the false/unsupported statements.
jdportes	704698116205879296	2016-03-01T16:01:38	AdamPerkinsPhD StrongerInNos You also said: " more children are being born to welfare claimants than to employed citizens." Agreed?
jdportes	704695892658495488	2016-03-01T15:52:48	AdamPerkinsPhD If you would simply retract and correct your incorrect &amp; unsupported statements ,this would be much easier...
jdportes	704695718729089024	2016-03-01T15:52:06	AdamPerkinsPhD StrongerInNos Statement "welfare policies can impact fertility" is uncontroversial. But it is *not* what you said.
jdportes	704695597383749632	2016-03-01T15:51:37	AdamPerkinsPhD StrongerInNos You make *unconditional* statements: unemployed/welfare claimants have more kids.  These are unsupported.
jdportes	704695421743067136	2016-03-01T15:50:55	AdamPerkinsPhD StrongerInNos You don't understand your own thesis!  "more children being born to welfare claimants than employed citizens"
jdportes	704694462447009793	2016-03-01T15:47:07	AdamPerkinsPhD StrongerInNos Basic problem here is that you asked ONS for wrong data - from a publicly available data set!
jdportes	704694284977610752	2016-03-01T15:46:24	AdamPerkinsPhD StrongerInNos [eg last two sentences are obviously simply false if unemployed much more likely not to have kids! Not hard.]
jdportes	704693923785138177	2016-03-01T15:44:58	AdamPerkinsPhD StrongerInNos (2/2) then your thesis falls. Not a "confound" - simply disproves your basic point.
jdportes	704693753836134400	2016-03-01T15:44:18	AdamPerkinsPhD StrongerInNos Basic logic fail. Your thesis is "unemployed" have more kids. So if they can't have/don't want kids (1/2)

jdportes	704420586940973056	2016-02-29T21:38:50	The_Ledge_ You have to remember  JediEconomist isn't interested in economics. Just obsessed with Jews (even those w/no Israel links).
jdportes	704420324415242241	2016-02-29T21:37:47	The_Ledge_ Theory? I don't do theory. I do facts: data, evidence, stats. [as it happens we have a project on construction sector now]
jdportes	704419211150532610	2016-02-29T21:33:22	The_Ledge_ maybe you shouldn't lecture an economist about "simple demand &amp; supply" if you don't have a clue what you're talking about?
jdportes	704418653467451393	2016-02-29T21:31:09	The_Ledge_ Yes, I've noticed that.  Letting all those foreign workers play in the Premier League has just sucked wealth out of the UK.
jdportes	704418299275255812	2016-02-29T21:29:44	The_Ledge_ This really is econ 101. Not rocket science:  
jdportes	704418117330583552	2016-02-29T21:29:01	The_Ledge_ simple explanation here: 
jdportes	704417557256781824	2016-02-29T21:26:47	The_Ledge_ No, really, it's not.  You don't understand the basic economics here. Immigration adds to labour demand too.
jdportes	704417427078189056	2016-02-29T21:26:16	The_Ledge_ I don't think you understand supply &amp; demand. Immigrants add to labour supply &amp; labour demand.  Impact on wages ambiguous.
jdportes	704416666227179520	2016-02-29T21:23:15	The_Ledge_ I chaired a panel last week that Patrick spoke on. Obviously, he'd favour a more "open door" immigration policy than I would.

jdportes	704416211455623169	2016-02-29T21:21:26	The_Ledge_ Simply saying "Cardiff has problems" &amp; blaming then on immigration isn't "facts".  We have evidence on, eg, migration/wages/jobs
jdportes	704415978868834304	2016-02-29T21:20:31	The_Ledge_ No reason for me to say that.  I rely on evidence. JediEconomist made very clear he was an anti-semite. You've not, obviously
jdportes	704415653596434432	2016-02-29T21:19:13	The_Ledge_ Don't be silly.You've given no evidence at all to connect eg migration &amp; wages - while I sent you a detailed evidence-based blog
jdportes	704414177033658368	2016-02-29T21:13:21	The_Ledge_ well, if you want to blame immigration for all problems, without any actual evidence, can't stop you..
jdportes	704411507384311808	2016-02-29T21:02:45	The_Ledge_ Cardiff's immigrant population is about national average. Less than half what is here. You were saying?
jdportes	704406307118391296	2016-02-29T20:42:05	The_Ledge_ Really? What constituency or local authority?

jdportes	704402633499525120	2016-02-29T20:27:29	The_Ledge_ I answered that. No views. I've no responsibility to have a view on a country I've never studied.
jdportes	704398737586659328	2016-02-29T20:12:00	The_Ledge_ but basic point obvious - you surely don't believe immigration (as opposed to deindustrialisation) destroyed Welsh valleys?

jdportes	701887971126022144	2016-02-22T21:55:07	fatwheezybloke LOL.  "Your boss can't cut your pay".  [well, actually, he can reduce it to the minimum wages, just not to zero]
jdportes	701886441727598593	2016-02-22T21:49:02	fatwheezybloke Seriously, you think it's OK for a Cabinet Minister to say "EU doesn't let us reduce VAT" when it's simply untrue?
jdportes	701886136130674688	2016-02-22T21:47:49	fatwheezybloke The Council of Ministers has to approve them. Some unanimously, some by QMV.
jdportes	701884729809829888	2016-02-22T21:42:14	fatwheezybloke Sorry, how is this not drivel? Last time I looked there was a UK Minister at every single Council of Ministers.
jdportes	701883142064447488	2016-02-22T21:35:56	fatwheezybloke Gove? Yes. He's supposed to be a serious Cabinet Minister. This sentence is drivel, isn't it?
jdportes	701882845728477184	2016-02-22T21:34:45	fatwheezybloke why say "cannot remove or reduce" if "cannot reduce" is simply untrue?
jdportes	701881789812514816	2016-02-22T21:30:33	fatwheezybloke as I noted, 3 factual errors in this 1 sentence alone 
jdportes	701877722113511425	2016-02-22T21:14:23	fatwheezybloke MrRBourne "not legally binding" doesn't mean "worthless."  You'll have to make up your own mind  ;-)
jdportes	701876560207486976	2016-02-22T21:09:46	MrRBourne fatwheezybloke PM did make straightforwardly false statement about EU migrants here 6m w/o job
jdportes	701876186356568065	2016-02-22T21:08:17	MrRBourne fatwheezybloke Think the "legally binding" one has been done to death (I'm no expert, but seems pretty clear it's not)
jdportes	701869546886578178	2016-02-22T20:41:54	MrRBourne Agree fact-checking should separate facts/stats from broader stuff - as you know I concentrate on former when I do it.
jdportes	701869321790824449	2016-02-22T20:41:01	Jacques_Hughes to be clear, my point not on merit/substance -it's about honesty &amp; treating voters with respect. See last para of my blog..
jdportes	701868701474226176	2016-02-22T20:38:33	Jacques_Hughes see here if you want to wade through some detail: 
jdportes	701868248892104707	2016-02-22T20:36:45	MrRBourne OK, so you've conceded 1 point (middle one).  On last point, we know UK Ministers voted for vast majority..
jdportes	701867123430264832	2016-02-22T20:32:16	Jacques_Hughes I'm afraid I can give you a number of other examples where he not only got things wrong but didn't correct.
jdportes	701866196103274496	2016-02-22T20:28:35	MrRBourne so seriously, are you saying that sentence is true?  [assuming you've seen Derby score at least a few times  ;-) ]
jdportes	701865841604825089	2016-02-22T20:27:11	MrRBourne Exactly. "Ryan has seen hundreds of Derby County matches, and in none of them did Derby score a goal"
jdportes	701865373537280001	2016-02-22T20:25:19	MrRBourne "Derby County has played dozens of matches this season, and lost none."
jdportes	701865202351001600	2016-02-22T20:24:38	MrRBourne Now that interpretation just isn't English, Ryan.
jdportes	701864883990749185	2016-02-22T20:23:23	Jacques_Hughes Actually, Latin America currently shrinking both absolutely and relative to EZ as IMF data shows.
jdportes	701864572454621186	2016-02-22T20:22:08	MrRBourne As for Parliament - are you saying no HoC motion or Select Committee called on EU to legislate? Seriously?
jdportes	701864253272276992	2016-02-22T20:20:52	MrRBourne "None of which I or any other British politician could alter in any way" straightforwardly false, agreed?
jdportes	701864001559465988	2016-02-22T20:19:52	Jacques_Hughes of course he's free to argue we shd have "global outlook", EZ diminishing. Fine.  But don't make stuff up!
jdportes	701863870697250816	2016-02-22T20:19:21	Jacques_Hughes montie This is not about "premises" or disagreements. It's about telling the truth. DanHannanMEP doesn't.
jdportes	701863656657702916	2016-02-22T20:18:30	MrRBourne You're not saying CoM doesn't include a UK Minister? Or that it doesn't alter EU legislation? So then what?
jdportes	701863364469858304	2016-02-22T20:17:20	MrRBourne And, as Hugo says, of course the UK Parliament asks EU to legislate on lots of things for good reasons.
jdportes	701863244777070592	2016-02-22T20:16:52	MrRBourne "None of which I could alter in any way". What does he think the Council of Ministers does?
jdportes	701862924567056387	2016-02-22T20:15:35	Jacques_Hughes No, that actually wouldn't make sense, because he also says every other continent is growing.
jdportes	701862681985347589	2016-02-22T20:14:38	Jacques_Hughes montie DanHannanMEP That would still be false, and he knows it.
jdportes	701861808815087616	2016-02-22T20:11:09	MrRBourne Samfr drlangtry_girl Hugodixon This 1 sentence contains 3 clear factual errors. 
jdportes	701861340290412544	2016-02-22T20:09:18	MrRBourne Samfr drlangtry_girl Hugodixon Many of these errors (agreed not all) are "objective facts", agreed?
jdportes	701860970222788608	2016-02-22T20:07:49	Jacques_Hughes montie 1.  DanHannanMEP said "Europe".  2. Even eurozone grew 1.5% in 2015, forecast 1.5% 2016. Why make stuff up.
jdportes	701860100672249856	2016-02-22T20:04:22	Samfr drlangtry_girl This is good on Gove btw..

jdportes	701858049678516224	2016-02-22T19:56:13	ImIncorrigible DanHannanMEP montie He has - Hugodixon told him this months ago.
jdportes	701857878144061440	2016-02-22T19:55:32	Jacques_Hughes montie DanHannanMEP Yes, but 2 minutes research does! Eg, see IMF: 
jdportes	701857451088412672	2016-02-22T19:53:50	charlsgeorgeson montie "Myth" is too kind. It's a flat out falsehood, as DanHannanMEP knows - Hugodixon told him months ago.
jdportes	701856763532988417	2016-02-22T19:51:06	This must be satirical, right, montie? DanHannanMEP's very 1st fact - "Europe is not growing" is simply false.

jdportes	698080211150184448	2016-02-12T09:44:26	NeilParker2 DCBMEP UK exports to EU 13-14% of GDP, UK imports from EU 16%+.  .
jdportes	698078768959791104	2016-02-12T09:38:42	NeilParker2 Yes, but an MEP really shouldn't be deliberately misleading readers. DCBMEP If not deliberate, he should correct.
jdportes	698072847613300736	2016-02-12T09:15:11	MarkGregory pswidlicki Yes, apparently imports aren't "trade" for DCBMEP Really an MEP ought to know better than this nonsense.
jdportes	698072551403188224	2016-02-12T09:14:00	NeilParker2 DCBMEP but then those numbers don't make any sense (obviously, lots of exporters export to both EU &amp; non-EU..)

jdportes	698069497421393920	2016-02-12T09:01:52	WhiteWednesday DCBMEP If that's what he did mean, it's either entirely economically illiterate or deliberately misleading..
jdportes	698069310741291008	2016-02-12T09:01:07	WhiteWednesday DCBMEP Guess it's possible. But "8% of UK economy trades with EU" completely different from "goods exports to EU=8% of GDP"
jdportes	698068339499917312	2016-02-12T08:57:16	What is DCBMEP talking about? UK exports to EU are more than £200 billion..   
jdportes	698067679777845252	2016-02-12T08:54:38	DCBMEP That's nonsense and surely you know it. UK exports to EU are about 13-14% of GDP, imports from EU &gt; 15%.
jdportes	698067433299513344	2016-02-12T08:53:40	StevePeers DCBMEP No, he says 5% of businesses!  [also, obvs, trade covers imports]. EU exports + EU imports &gt; 30% of UK GDP..
jdportes	698066583424520192	2016-02-12T08:50:17	pswidlicki That's a high bar.  I see your DCBMEP &amp; raise LouiseMensch  - citing DanHannanMEP's made up stats!
jdportes	698066128602533888	2016-02-12T08:48:29	drlangtry_girl DCBMEP Yes. But as the statistics clearly show, you're just a member of a tiny, out of touch metropolitan elite.
jdportes	698065600187334656	2016-02-12T08:46:23	"8% of the UK economy trades with the EU" says DCBMEP. No idea what that even means..
