MikeIsaac	708134676733501440	2016-03-11T03:37:18	I think this debate is perhaps more horrifying than any of the theatrics we've seen thus far in debates past
MikeIsaac	708134364203327488	2016-03-11T03:36:03	Cruz refuses to easily answer a "is physical violence bad for the GOP" trump question and instead goes after Obama

MikeIsaac	708126274213036032	2016-03-11T03:03:54	lol someone wanted to look tough
MikeIsaac	708126044721700864	2016-03-11T03:03:00	you messed up, cruz. your talking point is "completely and utterly destroy"

MikeIsaac	708124393373835265	2016-03-11T02:56:26	Cruz says he won't target innocent civilians, but he has promised to carpet bomb ISIS in Iraq &amp; Syria, which would target innocent civilians
MikeIsaac	708124558923046913	2016-03-11T02:57:05	Trump: "some of my biggest donations are Jewish"

MikeIsaac	708124242487996417	2016-03-11T02:55:50	cruz never says "terrorists." he will ALWAYS say "radical islamic terrorism."   his talking point repeated over and over and over
MikeIsaac	708122660211990529	2016-03-11T02:49:33	I can't even imagine what it must be like to be a Muslim American watching the GOP debate...

MikeIsaac	708121909884555265	2016-03-11T02:46:34	the crowd just laughed and clapped at that.
MikeIsaac	708119163718344706	2016-03-11T02:35:39	So, for the record, Rubio, Cruz, and Trump all have breathtakingly irresponsible tax plans they can't pay for:
