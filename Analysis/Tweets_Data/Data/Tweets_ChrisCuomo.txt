ChrisCuomo	725634146207432705	2016-04-28T10:33:56	The mandates of the shows differ. We test and disrupt. Others are more about justifying s particular perspective  
ChrisCuomo	725633470278590464	2016-04-28T10:31:15	They focused on needs more than wants but there was plenty of posturing - I am ok with that

ChrisCuomo	725294011976699904	2016-04-27T12:02:22	what does calling her on being a woman do? make her be one less? 
ChrisCuomo	725293869760405505	2016-04-27T12:01:48	mister chomp? hmmm...i like it! 
ChrisCuomo	725293699383611393	2016-04-27T12:01:07	seriously? 
ChrisCuomo	725291569331507200	2016-04-27T11:52:40	Yup. BUT must be smart about it- real coaches. EVFperformance is great in NYC. I avoid most oly lifting. You? 
ChrisCuomo	725290602758283264	2016-04-27T11:48:49	This wasn't an operation. We often get troop allocations from pentagon. Don't confuse the issue  
ChrisCuomo	725290401159110657	2016-04-27T11:48:01	SuicidalAltruis suggestion: don't watch NewDay to merely have all you like echoed. Have an open mind. maybe other ideas out there?
ChrisCuomo	725286371447939072	2016-04-27T11:32:00	Aren't we all. A major personal flaw of mine: not doing this for your approval :) 
ChrisCuomo	725286035060563968	2016-04-27T11:30:40	Good strategy? 
ChrisCuomo	725285364655624192	2016-04-27T11:28:00	Not a bluff game. This is about keeping it real. Asking abt dismissing Clinton as "just a woman" is playing PC? 
ChrisCuomo	725285049961164800	2016-04-27T11:26:45	SpielbergScott I respect ur shameless selfie but not your knowledge of how this works. This was not a strategy leak.  People should know
ChrisCuomo	725279623970435072	2016-04-27T11:05:12	i did. how playing the woman card? "she is"  disimssing her as just gender? "if wasnt a woman wouldnt get 5%" 
ChrisCuomo	725279187838357505	2016-04-27T11:03:28	wrong. we report what he said and that in voting results his numbers with women are low.  
ChrisCuomo	725278299618967552	2016-04-27T10:59:56	nah...team is strong. but there is a reason trump does msnbc for 20+ minutes and gets off with us after 10. testing?

ChrisCuomo	723519940641337344	2016-04-22T14:32:50	The law has standards - and a court decided these restrictions violate them. Get used to that

ChrisCuomo	723482779749650433	2016-04-22T12:05:11	So you should create a restriction despite a basis in fact?

ChrisCuomo	722396525662371840	2016-04-19T12:08:47	Key clarification :) 
ChrisCuomo	722395363882217472	2016-04-19T12:04:10	Not true! This primary needs to be a statement win for Clinton and Trump 
ChrisCuomo	722393554241384449	2016-04-19T11:56:59	And encouraged! But the first amendment is not simply a license to be your worst. So make arguments not insults  
ChrisCuomo	722393060273991680	2016-04-19T11:55:01	You are minimizing what transgender means. And I have stated no preference.  
ChrisCuomo	722392711542779904	2016-04-19T11:53:38	Clinton but only by 1? Other thoughts?

ChrisCuomo	722162664898736128	2016-04-18T20:39:31	Not at all. Daily beast made same assumption. I found it a surprising suggestion so I asked about it  
ChrisCuomo	722162331912970240	2016-04-18T20:38:11	Why am I sucked up in the math lesson?

ChrisCuomo	722161685503569921	2016-04-18T20:35:37	I never said I did. I asked Fallon for explanation because it was reported that HRC advisor said it was. Now what? 
ChrisCuomo	722158428089671680	2016-04-18T20:22:40	Unfair! errollouis reported HRC advisors saying so. I asked Fallon if that were true and offered counter argument

ChrisCuomo	722157304343371776	2016-04-18T20:18:13	I would test HRC same way.  Sanders has accepted many more invites than Clinton on NewDay. He doesn't fear testing  
ChrisCuomo	722156908984016896	2016-04-18T20:16:38	Wow! very very rare example of someone reconsidering reflexive negativity. respect

ChrisCuomo	722146789311320064	2016-04-18T19:36:26	Ha! Tell that to all Clintonistas who say I am a Berner every day. The job is to be disruptive; to test. Deal w/it  
ChrisCuomo	722058013801058304	2016-04-18T13:43:40	Good calves 
ChrisCuomo	722057865708597248	2016-04-18T13:43:05	That's the basis of the suit, pal. So, yeah, I brought it up.  
ChrisCuomo	722057735647453184	2016-04-18T13:42:34	That's not a lie...it is an argument distinction

ChrisCuomo	722056721473146880	2016-04-18T13:38:32	Check it yourself. And check this: find a morning show who has had Sanders on more often than NewDay 
ChrisCuomo	722052061349748737	2016-04-18T13:20:01	chriscuomo this a.m. Great show! Always informative. Wishing you a great day. On the water pretty soon? fishing
ChrisCuomo	722056362411356160	2016-04-18T13:37:06	That's not what he said when asked about Newtown originally. He said "no" about that suit. He said "yes" on NewDay 
ChrisCuomo	722056079128031232	2016-04-18T13:35:59	He didn't go that far but his case that HRC is compromised is not seemingly based on specific actions by her 
ChrisCuomo	722055873196093444	2016-04-18T13:35:09	Don't need new. legislation. Sanders admitted that on NewDay. He also admitted fed breaks up big banks already 
ChrisCuomo	722055440503279616	2016-04-18T13:33:26	So no "you hate Bernie. You never have him on. He is only on for a sec and never when it counts" today?  
ChrisCuomo	722054938306748416	2016-04-18T13:31:27	That's the right approach. Listen to what's offered, see how it holds up under scrutiny (on NewDay) then vote! 
ChrisCuomo	722054608303091712	2016-04-18T13:30:08	JimMichie how so, Jim?
ChrisCuomo	722045460521828352	2016-04-18T12:53:47	We just had SenSanders on New Day - where he had a lot to say during his final push in New York. Let's discuss! 
ChrisCuomo	722044607970873345	2016-04-18T12:50:24	Is your point I am to blame for that? :) my job is to be disprove to a case or argument.  To test. You be the judge 
ChrisCuomo	722039648407666690	2016-04-18T12:30:41	Not on NewDay son...that's the pernt

ChrisCuomo	722038201456705536	2016-04-18T12:24:56	I love dangerous, even harsh comedy. But heroin- not a joke. People are sleeping on this problem. I know it up close 
ChrisCuomo	722037619253764096	2016-04-18T12:22:37	NewDay on sen RonJohnsonWI talking heroin epidemic and whether it is right to sue Saudi govt for 9/11. Issues not empty hate yap

ChrisCuomo	722017713997131776	2016-04-18T11:03:32	The media took the vote away?  Don't let the establishment talk poison all notions. Parties control those rules 
ChrisCuomo	722017483016769536	2016-04-18T11:02:37	U refer to the speeches? Or other things? And do others have same issues as Clinton in this regard? 
ChrisCuomo	722016805397643265	2016-04-18T10:59:55	My guess is you don't like how the person you support is tested, right?  So give me specifics

ChrisCuomo	720905624985411584	2016-04-15T09:24:29	Was at his event other night. No one has had him on more than NewDay 
ChrisCuomo	720891961838813184	2016-04-15T08:30:11	What would happen if everyone with a harsh opinion on Twitter voted? 
ChrisCuomo	720891795224272896	2016-04-15T08:29:32	Who has made that an issue? If u refer to her speeches to banks...that is about preference not competence  
ChrisCuomo	720890823743827968	2016-04-15T08:25:40	Give me some context 
ChrisCuomo	720880066134020097	2016-04-15T07:42:55	Thanks to Bernie Sanders, we now know how many big corporations don’t pay taxes 
ChrisCuomo	720888103368540160	2016-04-15T08:14:51	We're starting at 5am this morning! Going to need all 4 of these mugs for coffee! 
ChrisCuomo	720803303018266624	2016-04-15T02:37:53	The debate is incredibly interesting, but it is not going to affect the underlying dynamics of the race that haven't changed in 5 months
ChrisCuomo	720786194288783360	2016-04-15T01:29:54	Even easier to be like them apparently. Very trumpian - give what you get. What happened to WWJD? 
ChrisCuomo	720786016777449474	2016-04-15T01:29:12	Violence - the ultimate example of failed intelligence  
ChrisCuomo	720785882593247232	2016-04-15T01:28:40	I ask them all morning long. Watch NewDay

ChrisCuomo	720785575280779264	2016-04-15T01:27:27	Politics was no picnic then either.  
ChrisCuomo	720301809542168576	2016-04-13T17:25:08	Thank you, MattaNapkin!! 
ChrisCuomo	720785055753322496	2016-04-15T01:25:23	Simple - as Pop said: any jackass can kick down a house, but it takes hard work and skill to build one 
ChrisCuomo	720784315072782336	2016-04-15T01:22:26	The vomiter of it. That's it. Negativity is a virus; the enemy of progress  
ChrisCuomo	720783953196687360	2016-04-15T01:21:00	Who wants to run and expose themselves to the people on here?! only vetting that seems to resonate is personal 
ChrisCuomo	720783586052464640	2016-04-15T01:19:33	When will someone see a tough question as only that...instead of bias? So many partisans play the victim constantly  
ChrisCuomo	720782864414089216	2016-04-15T01:16:41	Me too. He is a great brother and friend.  I am lucky to have him. Especially now  
ChrisCuomo	720782515263442945	2016-04-15T01:15:17	That's nothing - the racist, sexist, vile stuff people tweet in the name of supporting a candidate would make u ill 
ChrisCuomo	720782245234110469	2016-04-15T01:14:13	People seem to show support - especially in this cesspool  - by hating the other side.   
ChrisCuomo	720781758686486528	2016-04-15T01:12:17	Thanks for the pithy perspective as always. Hope there is some constructive debating tonight.  We need some relief! 
ChrisCuomo	720781122448318464	2016-04-15T01:09:45	This race has gotten so toxic - that THIS tweet is one of the more positive ones 
ChrisCuomo	720780748509331456	2016-04-15T01:08:16	mishruff I like this gif. I am one who doesn't believe in hyping breaking news. Ironically it is misused to make the opposite point -
ChrisCuomo	720780109054152704	2016-04-15T01:05:44	megchristensen that's in your head. So check yourself

ChrisCuomo	720604387673038848	2016-04-14T13:27:28	More bs criticism lumping all media together...hypocritical when you complain abt same being done to your campaign?

ChrisCuomo	720307646402666496	2016-04-13T17:48:20	They can only pretend not to love them. They can't seriously not love them. Impossible, agreed :)

ChrisCuomo	720251919407702017	2016-04-13T14:06:53	...Asked someone in just about every election ever :) 
ChrisCuomo	720223762260615168	2016-04-13T12:15:00	Does the Donald Trump campaign reject the system, or want to work the system? ChrisCuomo asks KatrinaPierson 
ChrisCuomo	720234529785561090	2016-04-13T12:57:47	look at it this way: less civil that tweet, the weaker the argument being made. always true 
ChrisCuomo	720234373275131904	2016-04-13T12:57:10	maybe so, but first, PROVE what you allege. second, CHANGE what you are against...dont become the same thing 
ChrisCuomo	720233873796440064	2016-04-13T12:55:11	u judge what she says vs what u believe. i am disruptive to both sides...so it is not personal to me. make sense? 
ChrisCuomo	720233222777479168	2016-04-13T12:52:36	third party run feasible at this point?...i guess someone could co opt an existing party if on enough ballots 
ChrisCuomo	720232696639787008	2016-04-13T12:50:30	no, katrina is making the case for her candidate...and is good at it. dont make it personal. arguments not insults 
ChrisCuomo	720232240869961728	2016-04-13T12:48:42	one beef at a time: system rigged BECAUSE OF trump as he says? seems not. is system flawed? seems so. 
ChrisCuomo	720231552903471104	2016-04-13T12:45:58	i am trying to get people to just talk about anything that matters...i dont care if they use hand signals :) 
ChrisCuomo	720230966371946496	2016-04-13T12:43:38	i dont see cleveland (which "rocks", as the song suggests) being to blame for anything about the convention process 
ChrisCuomo	720227869788610560	2016-04-13T12:31:20	i dont know...you tell me 
ChrisCuomo	720227693544022016	2016-04-13T12:30:37	it is you...most definitely. 
ChrisCuomo	720215053467848704	2016-04-13T11:40:24	because no one seems to want that 
ChrisCuomo	720214935943442433	2016-04-13T11:39:56	depends on the field and the position. subjective standard 
ChrisCuomo	720214605662986240	2016-04-13T11:38:37	you tell me 
ChrisCuomo	720214332299153408	2016-04-13T11:37:32	who started it aside...money in politics is the root issue of most complaints...will it change?

ChrisCuomo	720213578633068544	2016-04-13T11:34:32	history does not suggest that. which third party are you considering? 
ChrisCuomo	720209828703047680	2016-04-13T11:19:38	"semblance of impropriety" "appearance of conflict"  
ChrisCuomo	720209184067887104	2016-04-13T11:17:04	agreed

ChrisCuomo	720022177639243776	2016-04-12T22:53:59	I hate this picture 
ChrisCuomo	720021855487320064	2016-04-12T22:52:42	Plenty of other ways to identify foolishness...no reason to use a term that offends, right? 
ChrisCuomo	720020706331926528	2016-04-12T22:48:08	Prove it 
ChrisCuomo	720020322863443968	2016-04-12T22:46:36	Well aware. Why don't you state its merits as you see it? 
ChrisCuomo	720020186686955520	2016-04-12T22:46:04	Brother...it's 45 years old.  
ChrisCuomo	720019781890482180	2016-04-12T22:44:27	sesiegler I will not use it again. Apologies.  Is there a site to direct others to raise awareness?
ChrisCuomo	720019177407426560	2016-04-12T22:42:03	We don't do the same job. She is a boss, runs magazines. I am a grunt who engages people like you  
ChrisCuomo	720018664016232448	2016-04-12T22:40:01	Why should they not make the same despite performance...seeing how that is the understood condition? 
ChrisCuomo	720018011592200193	2016-04-12T22:37:25	My thread is full of mouth breathing men crying this is a non issue and a lot of other tripe. Typical 
ChrisCuomo	720016346680057857	2016-04-12T22:30:48	Does finding an example of assumed parity mean there is no issue otherwise, counsel? 
ChrisCuomo	720016037157199873	2016-04-12T22:29:35	You tell me... 
ChrisCuomo	720015688891568128	2016-04-12T22:28:12	And that's where it gets problematic 
ChrisCuomo	720015207255437312	2016-04-12T22:26:17	And now we know you have no clue 
ChrisCuomo	720015101500239872	2016-04-12T22:25:52	Recent stats suggest Asian women are closest...at about 84% of what men make EqualPayDay 
ChrisCuomo	719995043935842304	2016-04-12T21:06:09	Why would I put kids on the spot?  
ChrisCuomo	719980461540405248	2016-04-12T20:08:13	ChrisCuomo Cubans are great ppl. It is the government that sucks, just like any Russian sycophant dictator
ChrisCuomo	719994423430549504	2016-04-12T21:03:42	EqualPayDay simple question: why should WOMEN not make as much as men for the same work?
ChrisCuomo	719994246065954817	2016-04-12T21:02:59	Good cause but poor analysis...we were the only ones to have Cohen on to make this point. So check yourself  
ChrisCuomo	719896986393190401	2016-04-12T14:36:31	Probably cost me my job if I did 
ChrisCuomo	719893222772862976	2016-04-12T14:21:33	Are kids in Cuba little Fidel zealots?  You tell me. 
ChrisCuomo	719871185740263424	2016-04-12T12:53:59	Not true - but I do have unique insight from knowing pols off camera in way most reporters don't  
ChrisCuomo	719870901047730177	2016-04-12T12:52:52	U r missing the point. Cruz prepared. Trump did not.  
ChrisCuomo	719867689523638272	2016-04-12T12:40:06	They have more people - so their will would have weight obviously right? 
ChrisCuomo	719867322857615360	2016-04-12T12:38:38	Electoral college gets heat as well 
ChrisCuomo	719867151755165696	2016-04-12T12:37:58	True but not exactly easy in all states 
ChrisCuomo	719853479305613312	2016-04-12T11:43:38	Mobocracy ?  
ChrisCuomo	719853216687636481	2016-04-12T11:42:35	Actually he CAN rail, and it probably plays well with many who "hate the system" 
ChrisCuomo	719852644680998912	2016-04-12T11:40:19	This is the rationale that works for trump campaign...but bottom line takes a ground game to win the race  
ChrisCuomo	719852009092943872	2016-04-12T11:37:47	On here the response is usually why you suck :) 
ChrisCuomo	719851867929518080	2016-04-12T11:37:14	How do you keep more populous states from dominating selection? 
ChrisCuomo	719851633149157376	2016-04-12T11:36:18	I don't doubt that many in Colorado were unaware of GOP state party rules. But campaigns were aware 
ChrisCuomo	719851267498057728	2016-04-12T11:34:51	Their point is the process of picking reps should be driven by people not party/insiders 
ChrisCuomo	719851057724190720	2016-04-12T11:34:01	From your lips to God's ears 
ChrisCuomo	719850521557876736	2016-04-12T11:31:53	Obama didn't take lead until mid-may but by early June had 2-1 superdel lead. Check it. Get the point? 
ChrisCuomo	719850109924720641	2016-04-12T11:30:15	Online 
ChrisCuomo	719846863155957760	2016-04-12T11:17:20	Do you not realize the state party made rules a long time ago and campaigns all knew system? 
ChrisCuomo	719846295389749248	2016-04-12T11:15:05	I think standard is universal. The problems are often obvious - what would you do and do voters believe you can 
ChrisCuomo	719845452288561156	2016-04-12T11:11:44	That feels even more true about the caucus system. But we don't even vote online. States drop the ball often 
ChrisCuomo	719845027808198656	2016-04-12T11:10:03	We need proof of allegations  
ChrisCuomo	719844679689310210	2016-04-12T11:08:40	OR - are the rules evidence of the toxic insider system he stands against?  
ChrisCuomo	719844360041406464	2016-04-12T11:07:24	That was more about voting irregularities more than rules. Look, our voting system has many flaws. No question 
ChrisCuomo	719843998693769216	2016-04-12T11:05:58	One, no many probably don't draw the distinction but the real concern is that states cut people out to pick faves  
ChrisCuomo	719843550742097920	2016-04-12T11:04:11	Bernie has connected with the concerns of many in his party and beyond. How to solve those problems is the challenge 
ChrisCuomo	719843095903408128	2016-04-12T11:02:22	What do you think? 
ChrisCuomo	719842766990258176	2016-04-12T11:01:04	WRONGO - point is you had time to prepare just like Cruz did. He organized better and won.

ChrisCuomo	719842124448063488	2016-04-12T10:58:31	The rules were known for months. Campaigns plan for each state where they can be competitive. This is a fact  
ChrisCuomo	719836465220489216	2016-04-12T10:36:01	"Rigged" a YEAR in advance? Or poor org and sour grapes? Will electoral system be target in general? 
ChrisCuomo	719835863853703168	2016-04-12T10:33:38	Sanders back ~300 pledged delegates. BUT can be close enough to force action at convention/a place for his agenda

ChrisCuomo	719592876758462465	2016-04-11T18:28:05	Of course. Point: Sanders was for same bill Clinton was. comes down to "predator" comment. Was Bill Clinton right?

ChrisCuomo	719490872845418497	2016-04-11T11:42:46	is it about the bill or the characterization of blacks that is the issue for sanders?

ChrisCuomo	718541535286005761	2016-04-08T20:50:26	Because: ambition, avarice, and toxic environment yields instinct to manipulate for desired outcome ?

ChrisCuomo	718540492540157952	2016-04-08T20:46:17	GOP - or any party, makes its rules. President has plenty o sway with their party, right? 
ChrisCuomo	718540238512119808	2016-04-08T20:45:17	point seems to be: don't focus on exclusion but inclusion. Don't think about whom to keep out but letting more in  
ChrisCuomo	718539824630743040	2016-04-08T20:43:38	How so? 
ChrisCuomo	718539723829092352	2016-04-08T20:43:14	True but "the rules" are seen as part of establishment... 
ChrisCuomo	718539160768917504	2016-04-08T20:41:00	Other side says: if don't make it to 50+1% of delegates...it is undecided and open to convention contest  
ChrisCuomo	718538809839902720	2016-04-08T20:39:36	you don't just "run inde". You have to get on ballots. There is time and money and process. May be too late  
ChrisCuomo	718496594216296449	2016-04-08T17:51:51	That's one aspect of concern.  We will see. My car ready at shop - so this ends the Twitter session. TGIF.  
ChrisCuomo	718495986927185920	2016-04-08T17:49:26	election is about bucking the norm so all aspects of process (like convention rules) can play as part of problem

ChrisCuomo	718493268959432704	2016-04-08T17:38:38	So rule about 1237 doesn't matter? Asking not opining

ChrisCuomo	718491742648057856	2016-04-08T17:32:35	Sarcasm aside, convention does have rules...so what should GOP do if no one has 1237 before or after first vote? 
ChrisCuomo	718490646823182337	2016-04-08T17:28:13	So a symbol...like (formerly known as) prince?

ChrisCuomo	718485903208001536	2016-04-08T17:09:22	Is "odd" a dis? And rings outside gloves is in the same category, yes  
ChrisCuomo	718485292185948161	2016-04-08T17:06:57	ArthurSpina1 is it trumpian or trumpet? What is the preferred pro-trump moniker?

ChrisCuomo	718219016767217665	2016-04-07T23:28:52	Sure it is smart...much better than what trump is telling people: that he was talking about all of us

ChrisCuomo	718052854334889985	2016-04-07T12:28:35	EXCEPT - a law exempted the entire gun industry from such liability suits 
ChrisCuomo	718052499022823425	2016-04-07T12:27:11	fair point...volunteer to shake-awake that mighty mouth? 
ChrisCuomo	718052263449726976	2016-04-07T12:26:15	CyberCiety and you are a lawyer? come on now :)
ChrisCuomo	718052052543397889	2016-04-07T12:25:24	icntmx lemme guess....lion tamer?
ChrisCuomo	718051899791056896	2016-04-07T12:24:48	PROPONENTS: guns are unique in being solely designed to kill. but they are legal to make...and thats the tension 
ChrisCuomo	718051511541039104	2016-04-07T12:23:15	i am 718 all the way but from the strong side...QUEENS! HOLLA RECCANIZE

ChrisCuomo	718050784684941312	2016-04-07T12:20:22	then everyone on here is gottam deperate! :) 
ChrisCuomo	718050170978611200	2016-04-07T12:17:56	you have insight and info! gotta work you for both, brother! 
ChrisCuomo	718049997514792960	2016-04-07T12:17:14	interesting:  some say shouldnt, others say should if knowingly sell to wrong people, others say should period 
ChrisCuomo	718035155861041152	2016-04-07T11:18:16	either weapon is legal to sell or not. if it is legal, where does the extra liability for its manufacture come in? 
ChrisCuomo	718033631629938688	2016-04-07T11:12:12	ChrisCuomo thank you, counselor, for clarifying who started the NotQualified debate, and getting specific on gun mtg. immunity. Well done.
ChrisCuomo	718034887425572864	2016-04-07T11:17:12	THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE is real and the need for treatment goes FAR beyond stopping violence. 
ChrisCuomo	718034533497614336	2016-04-07T11:15:47	BIG legal difference: liability for selling to people you know shouldnt have gun AND suing for JUST making the gun? 
ChrisCuomo	718033782436143104	2016-04-07T11:12:48	i say this too often, but it bears repeating...we test both sides...neither sides like it.  
ChrisCuomo	718031312804847616	2016-04-07T11:03:00	again...the senator is always welcome and has been interviewed by me many times. google it 
ChrisCuomo	718030850999328769	2016-04-07T11:01:09	tell me then, big boy, why is my thread FULL of different takes on it? 
ChrisCuomo	718029328257257473	2016-04-07T10:55:06	both are going negative. happens. pop was no puppy dog either but the game has changed... 
ChrisCuomo	718028554303180801	2016-04-07T10:52:02	the job is to ask and to press but sometimes a nonresponse tells the voter something as well 
ChrisCuomo	718028014953562113	2016-04-07T10:49:53	yes. senator sanders always welcome on NewDay i think we have intvd him most 
ChrisCuomo	718027616356274176	2016-04-07T10:48:18	does that make the laugh a dog whistle as well? odd how the laugh emboldened supporters and berners? 
ChrisCuomo	718026329212502016	2016-04-07T10:43:11	safer play than saying all ny'ers are evidence of a problem... 
ChrisCuomo	718026196794097664	2016-04-07T10:42:40	amen amen. you were embracing the grind...respect! 
ChrisCuomo	718025580298563585	2016-04-07T10:40:13	i am hearing this but didnt read it into the statement. explain? 
ChrisCuomo	718025417358249984	2016-04-07T10:39:34	you too! find away to make it matter and to be happy 
ChrisCuomo	718025317688983554	2016-04-07T10:39:10	thats how we do on NewDay intv on right now! 
ChrisCuomo	718024666993070082	2016-04-07T10:36:35	i feel you but you gotta win to do the job, so it is about both, right? 
ChrisCuomo	718024540627083264	2016-04-07T10:36:05	which is why NewDay has 12 minute clinton intv on now? and just finished a full segment on the ground war in iraq? 
ChrisCuomo	718023262064742400	2016-04-07T10:31:00	even on twitter, this seems a deranged reckoning to me 
ChrisCuomo	718003783712829440	2016-04-07T09:13:36	Our lights aren't even on yet in the green room and on set. Everyone awake this morning? 
ChrisCuomo	717812674655072260	2016-04-06T20:34:12	The irony is everyone says they want fairness but nobody likes it when they get it...they want their thumb on scale 
ChrisCuomo	717812146344747008	2016-04-06T20:32:06	By reading a single opinion piece? 
ChrisCuomo	717774395763130368	2016-04-06T18:02:06	Yep! A double dose of MinuteThatMatters today. Let's discuss! 
ChrisCuomo	717765817945964544	2016-04-06T17:28:01	I did but the answers sanders gave stand on own as well 
ChrisCuomo	717765711196766209	2016-04-06T17:27:35	I am edgy...see my avatar. Thanks for watching and respecting the style 
ChrisCuomo	717763990827479041	2016-04-06T17:20:45	ChrisCuomo Good, sophisticated interview on substantive matters. Thank you sir.
ChrisCuomo	717765249437458433	2016-04-06T17:25:45	Dems voting for Clinton obviously think she is better choice ... But not all votes carry same emotion 
ChrisCuomo	717765061796831232	2016-04-06T17:25:00	U have the issue teed up correctly from one perspective.  
ChrisCuomo	717763168282537984	2016-04-06T17:17:29	Who's the real "New Yorkah"? Is it "Bernie from Brooklyn," or the fmr NY Senator?   ChrisCuomo asks HillaryClinton 
ChrisCuomo	717759404163129345	2016-04-06T17:02:31	"Yes I do" HillaryClinton tells ChrisCuomo she thinks she'll earn the magic delegate number before the convention 
ChrisCuomo	717761918954446848	2016-04-06T17:12:31	Hillary Clinton responds to Bernie Sanders' campaign manager suggesting her ambition could destroy the party. 
ChrisCuomo	717760160140238848	2016-04-06T17:05:32	Hillary Clinton cites two big differences between her and Bernie Sanders: Big banks and guns. 
ChrisCuomo	717759118812045312	2016-04-06T17:01:23	"I'm feeling very good about where we are" -- HillaryClinton is optimistic about her overall lead 
ChrisCuomo	717728996197277697	2016-04-06T15:01:42	Chris told us not to post this but it's too good!  -Team Cuomo 
ChrisCuomo	717715087511912448	2016-04-06T14:06:26	Today's MinuteThatMatters I HAVE to tell you where I went last night - too excited to write about it! 
ChrisCuomo	717706362051039232	2016-04-06T13:31:45	Hunnit 
ChrisCuomo	717705952561074176	2016-04-06T13:30:08	Grazie 
ChrisCuomo	717702205160230915	2016-04-06T13:15:14	I'd say it's how she emerges from victory.Seems like young Sanders supporters are following based on trend or# dream 
ChrisCuomo	717705750559195140	2016-04-06T13:29:19	Most...~ 2.6mm but there is a but. Sanders is more than relevant. How big a deal is enthusiasm? 
ChrisCuomo	717705156394139648	2016-04-06T13:26:58	They should have already know the 5ftassassin 
ChrisCuomo	717704974919196672	2016-04-06T13:26:14	Never seen it so concentrated with so many legends in such a legendary place. Quoted phife twice today :) 
ChrisCuomo	717703813965221888	2016-04-06T13:21:38	WOW! Posting on FB about it. Honoring the memory but also the message of living for joy not h8! IamthePHIFER RIP 
ChrisCuomo	717697815007391744	2016-04-06T12:57:47	i invite the senator on often 
ChrisCuomo	717694792109568000	2016-04-06T12:45:47	true. but the momentum matters beyond numbers no? is it just winning or how clinton emerges from a victory? 
ChrisCuomo	717694590132813824	2016-04-06T12:44:59	really? why now? 
ChrisCuomo	717694506666213376	2016-04-06T12:44:39	read it. that is one take...there are others, many disagree  
ChrisCuomo	717690399377195008	2016-04-06T12:28:19	what about the sanders argument that asking for little gets u even less?  
ChrisCuomo	717689138598842369	2016-04-06T12:23:19	you dont love it...your take is grossly misleading...trumper spoke for ~ minute and cruzer got a chance to rebut  
ChrisCuomo	717683330863513600	2016-04-06T12:00:14	ChrisCuomo TY for that interview w/ Shields. I lrnd more in those few min than I have in 6 mos. An intelligent conversation Go figure. 😊
ChrisCuomo	717684639192780800	2016-04-06T12:05:26	math is in her favor. enthusiasm and trust among DEMOCRATS are not apparently...thats the rub 
ChrisCuomo	717684350326861824	2016-04-06T12:04:17	not as simple as just doing it. trump may have to take an existing party nomination...not sure thats' possible 
ChrisCuomo	717683955256987648	2016-04-06T12:02:43	RIGHT? guy was a cipher! 
ChrisCuomo	717676245371199488	2016-04-06T11:32:05	.ChrisCuomo talks with HillaryClinton at 11:15amET. Watch live at .

ChrisCuomo	717677950913671169	2016-04-06T11:38:51	Krs ON POINT at IamthePHIFER Malik memorial at ApolloTheater last night.  Very very powerful tribute TCQ Queens 
ChrisCuomo	717677395877240832	2016-04-06T11:36:39	It was alliteration...no h8 
ChrisCuomo	717671070657089536	2016-04-06T11:11:31	how did i let him blame? 
ChrisCuomo	717670770051301377	2016-04-06T11:10:19	tell us why it is so misleading, peach? and what would be your network logo? 
ChrisCuomo	717670087789002752	2016-04-06T11:07:37	show bias 
ChrisCuomo	717669626461745154	2016-04-06T11:05:47	not necessarily on either side
ChrisCuomo	717669191021629440	2016-04-06T11:04:03	distinguish exposing and testing from impact. the dnews sanders answers are out there, voters will weigh in votes 
ChrisCuomo	717668921529077760	2016-04-06T11:02:59	part of the job. fibonacci, in reply to FAQ, not a pol., created a number you can google for why i referenced 
ChrisCuomo	717668307571236864	2016-04-06T11:00:32	BUT he is talking to gop voters... 
ChrisCuomo	717668079023570944	2016-04-06T10:59:38	my brother. gop has EVERY right to feel that way abt dems. when raised in politics, u dont take politics personally  
ChrisCuomo	717667088257708032	2016-04-06T10:55:42	not a malapropism to be sure. her usage - as always - was spot on imo. 
ChrisCuomo	717650727049568257	2016-04-06T09:50:41	ChrisCuomo Good morning, Chris, all the way from Jersey City! Looking forward to the post-Wisconsin NewDay show! 
ChrisCuomo	717661296943095808	2016-04-06T10:32:41	He clear: math is NOT in sanders favor. Can he win over superdel's and others and make convention contested? Yes 
ChrisCuomo	717661035155628033	2016-04-06T10:31:38	A key question: Can Clinton win them over? Ot can sanders lose them? How big will dnews difficulties loom for him? 
ChrisCuomo	717657457875619840	2016-04-06T10:17:26	ChrisCuomo  - it's not a seed, it's a sapling! Good one! And quite true.
ChrisCuomo	717651070407860225	2016-04-06T09:52:03	Don't let the trees in the lobby fool you - it feels like WINTER in New York! 
ChrisCuomo	717530067866415105	2016-04-06T01:51:13	Huge wins tonight for sanders and Cruz. Unprecedented losses by the leading candidates this late in process.
ChrisCuomo	717526515639066624	2016-04-06T01:37:06	Breaking: CNN projects Ted Cruz will win the Republican WIPrimary  
ChrisCuomo	717462791884550145	2016-04-05T21:23:54	That would be too high a bar 
ChrisCuomo	717462619100168192	2016-04-05T21:23:12	Don't be so deep.  
ChrisCuomo	717462453051867138	2016-04-05T21:22:33	Poor guy...hope his affliction passes :) 
ChrisCuomo	717457351113093120	2016-04-05T21:02:16	Of absolutely no one! Totally dominated at work/home. Right now I am changing channels for 6yo cuz she told me to  
ChrisCuomo	717457006148366336	2016-04-05T21:00:54	Is it? OR is it my right on my thread to highlight and try to change people who r being willfully ignorant ? 
ChrisCuomo	717456629378248708	2016-04-05T20:59:24	MaryPatRyan was the man transgender? If not, how is it a precedent?  Shows perverts have sneaked into bathrooms for a long time
ChrisCuomo	717456204256116737	2016-04-05T20:57:43	Would you feel that way if the pace of change were an attack on your freedom and dignity? 
ChrisCuomo	717433940198424576	2016-04-05T19:29:15	Seeing these pop up all over NC! Clarknt67 PatMcCroryNC pamspaulding Americaputz CNN ChrisCuomo samkalidi 
ChrisCuomo	717455557708423169	2016-04-05T20:55:09	As a reminder of how my deceased pop tried long ago to change how the regime stifles freedom...like I said  
ChrisCuomo	717455343530426368	2016-04-05T20:54:18	You=bs. I said what's point of regime if not to lift everyone up. Meaning: the regime has failed and has no purpose  
ChrisCuomo	717454784899518464	2016-04-05T20:52:05	See how fair I am? 
ChrisCuomo	717416581907816448	2016-04-05T18:20:16	Tobacco co's weren't held to standard some want for gun makers 
ChrisCuomo	717416230890692608	2016-04-05T18:18:53	You don't know? Better ask somebody :) 
ChrisCuomo	717416112149950464	2016-04-05T18:18:24	blog wrong and offensive - as usual. Not abt letting men next to little. U don't respect transgender - we get it  
ChrisCuomo	717414977661968384	2016-04-05T18:13:54	History matters. No one celebrating che. Be right or be quiet 
ChrisCuomo	717414640435732484	2016-04-05T18:12:33	Math is not favorable. No one saying he can't win. Get real 
ChrisCuomo	717414471690534913	2016-04-05T18:11:53	Fearless? Sin miedo...hmmm....never heard guapo used for that 
ChrisCuomo	717360626667036672	2016-04-05T14:37:55	Guapo is Espanol. No question about it  
ChrisCuomo	717359748350349312	2016-04-05T14:34:26	Read the memo. That's not how he explains it 
ChrisCuomo	717359439272132608	2016-04-05T14:33:12	Don't see basis for that. But we will know soon enough.  
ChrisCuomo	717340818672103424	2016-04-05T13:19:13	The criticism stands and is a challenge he openly addresses  
ChrisCuomo	717340633648771072	2016-04-05T13:18:29	How about I choke him and we see where it goes? 
ChrisCuomo	717340439884513281	2016-04-05T13:17:43	Mick is on after us. She couldn't be THAT cruel after crushing my heart like a cherry tomahto

ChrisCuomo	717339949348077568	2016-04-05T13:15:46	ccookbr I only show you the extreme views. Thread is 85% positive. The "crazies" often are more useful to dialogue
ChrisCuomo	717339707122782208	2016-04-05T13:14:48	Mick is breaking many hearts...mine most of all. She just looks at me and says "get over it, old man" 
ChrisCuomo	717339278930526208	2016-04-05T13:13:06	The Gov has endorsed HRC. he is more talented and smarter and preferred by mom...but ur correct otherwise :) 
ChrisCuomo	717338774057955328	2016-04-05T13:11:05	Indisputable.  Something - arguably many things - have to change

ChrisCuomo	717337237789229056	2016-04-05T13:04:59	All seem to agree. Who to fix SHOULD BE  a function of how to fix 
ChrisCuomo	717336991122264064	2016-04-05T13:04:00	Unboycott - mick is worth it. Even though she is breaking my little black heart

ChrisCuomo	717334919337406469	2016-04-05T12:55:46	Fair point. Logic goes to selling them in high crime areas but logic is specious  
ChrisCuomo	717334207106834432	2016-04-05T12:52:57	The problem is real and painfully clear. Solutions are not

ChrisCuomo	717333893729411072	2016-04-05T12:51:42	Unfair. You assume effort is the criterion... 
ChrisCuomo	717333710157295618	2016-04-05T12:50:58	Fair comparison? Inspiration and ambitious ideas matter but does practicality matter as well? 
ChrisCuomo	717329711320403968	2016-04-05T12:35:05	Possible? Yes. Probable? No, for political and practical economic reasons  
ChrisCuomo	717328134094327809	2016-04-05T12:28:49	So you missed pushing that math says he can't win; 15 min wage being undoable; superdelegtes mattering ?

ChrisCuomo	716648700467130369	2016-04-03T15:28:59	Odd motivation. How about picking cand who unites/ moves country together? Also, trump down to Cruz in WI right now 
ChrisCuomo	716648228356227072	2016-04-03T15:27:06	Oh, and the 5 economists I asked about it laughed at the question.  
ChrisCuomo	716648122714161153	2016-04-03T15:26:41	No, but I stated at a Holiday Inn Express last night.  
ChrisCuomo	716647897425657856	2016-04-03T15:25:48	One metric. Simpler: hard to factor a trade balance that yields +19T given other debt service commitments  
ChrisCuomo	716647692680708097	2016-04-03T15:24:59	At least he's talking abt debt. We need plans from ALL candidates. hint: pols ignore debt. Why? no short term gain

ChrisCuomo	715878077138542592	2016-04-01T12:26:48	Yeah! The only way to be fair is to be negative and insulting. Wish that notion only made sense on AprilFools

ChrisCuomo	715877111525826560	2016-04-01T12:22:58	growing up in politics I saw both sides as largely the same - both deserve patting and prodding at times

ChrisCuomo	715875244217475072	2016-04-01T12:15:33	So at convention you are open to a different candidate coming out? Esp if trump not at 1237? 
ChrisCuomo	715875000541061120	2016-04-01T12:14:35	The toxically partisan will come at you because they only want to see their opponents tested. Ignore or pity them.

ChrisCuomo	715873419468754944	2016-04-01T12:08:18	Slogan suggests America not great but larger issue is what is don't in name of slogan - that's where vibe comes from 
ChrisCuomo	715873249062572032	2016-04-01T12:07:37	It is a balance...if push too much you don't get intvs (notice how often trump NOT on NewDay) 
ChrisCuomo	715872941825626112	2016-04-01T12:06:24	Truth is - we test trump. all candidates must be tested. Even if attack they you/go on other shows more as a result 
ChrisCuomo	715872676280053760	2016-04-01T12:05:20	Not sure. Trump tapping into very real discontent - not of his own making. Question is can he make it better?

ChrisCuomo	714441154327142402	2016-03-28T13:16:59	One ignored aspect: people/voters are more interested in trump as we see in ratings. Why is that ignored?

ChrisCuomo	714434691101827072	2016-03-28T12:51:18	One reason: they won't keep coming on show. Notice trump on other cable morning shows much more often? HRC too?

ChrisCuomo	714430196372348928	2016-03-28T12:33:26	I keep saying this because it bears repeating -refugees are vetted more than many other categories of entrants

ChrisCuomo	714290360936226816	2016-03-28T03:17:47	True. Now Italian Americans are just more white people...difference of a few generations. But, new ban is diff too 
ChrisCuomo	714289576462983174	2016-03-28T03:14:40	not true...but few who support trump don't support a move like that 
ChrisCuomo	714289236057452544	2016-03-28T03:13:19	mikwjes I actually asked him EXACTLY about the shortfall estimates. But keep hating as if it motivates me
ChrisCuomo	714288768069578752	2016-03-28T03:11:27	This is very different today...but aspects of it are the same, capisci? 
ChrisCuomo	714283588871712768	2016-03-28T02:50:52	A pause sends a message around the world that matters. So the question becomes what is the upside? How real is that? 
ChrisCuomo	714283024129589248	2016-03-28T02:48:38	There is little objective basis to back up the fear...sadly, fear feeds itself  
ChrisCuomo	714281223946944512	2016-03-28T02:41:29	I get your fear but you know people said that about my grandparents.   
ChrisCuomo	714257882620030977	2016-03-28T01:08:44	On this we agree.   
ChrisCuomo	714257685340897281	2016-03-28T01:07:57	Religions can be interpreted to allow many things. In the main, islam like Christianity is taught to embrace virtue 
ChrisCuomo	714257374505250818	2016-03-28T01:06:42	I don't agree with the cynicism...besides you say what is right regardless of anticipated reception  
ChrisCuomo	714257073123536897	2016-03-28T01:05:31	Don't you think they should be gotten? 
ChrisCuomo	714256943876071424	2016-03-28T01:05:00	And you care because? 
ChrisCuomo	714256563104571396	2016-03-28T01:03:29	Refugees vetted better than many other categories of entrants.  Nothing 100% 
ChrisCuomo	714256332434632704	2016-03-28T01:02:34	ArlingtonSteve If i murder and say it is in the name of Christ...I am actually violating his rule. So I am not devout; I am corrupt
ChrisCuomo	714255676567134213	2016-03-28T00:59:58	Pascua feliz y el mejor para mi amiga!  
ChrisCuomo	714255136118456320	2016-03-28T00:57:49	nice to be missed, especially for bad reason :) Happy Easter. Time away gave me ideas re doing things differently  
ChrisCuomo	714253479859122176	2016-03-28T00:51:14	That was something  
ChrisCuomo	714253378713427970	2016-03-28T00:50:50	CaptMarciano happy Easter Capt !  Best to the family
ChrisCuomo	714253066506276864	2016-03-28T00:49:35	You referred to yourself as a journalist...you are an advocate but even as that you must be open to the other side  
ChrisCuomo	714252879352225792	2016-03-28T00:48:51	CarmineSabia I don't hear any original arguments on your thread. Not that you need any to make the desired points. It is a popular mode
ChrisCuomo	714252623881310208	2016-03-28T00:47:50	Arnold_August let's start again...what is your point ?
ChrisCuomo	714252438832824320	2016-03-28T00:47:06	We don't pay for any supporters 
ChrisCuomo	714252284822204416	2016-03-28T00:46:29	They believe a perversion of the faith tantamount to an abandonment of the virtues of Islam? 
ChrisCuomo	714252004990783489	2016-03-28T00:45:22	I was referring to people here taking rhetoric too far. Extreme ISLAMISM is the problem. Not Islam.  
ChrisCuomo	714251733908717568	2016-03-28T00:44:18	We are what we do and America is testing its mettle right now. This is a definitional election. What will prevail? 
ChrisCuomo	714251482682548225	2016-03-28T00:43:18	Those haters started the misperception. And too many are ready to believe without thought. A common malady 
ChrisCuomo	714250893877768192	2016-03-28T00:40:57	People debate it constantly using your lines of argument. Many agree with you.

ChrisCuomo	714248941152387072	2016-03-28T00:33:12	Be proud! Amazing to have a boat at all. Boat doesn't catch the fish anyway :) 
ChrisCuomo	714248061086732289	2016-03-28T00:29:42	dontpokepanda not my basis 4 analysis. ask why people wouldn't watch as much. Compassion fatigue? Lack of concern? That's a problem
ChrisCuomo	714247087500750848	2016-03-28T00:25:50	I don't accept that. That rationale has always been worse than the problem it is applied to 
ChrisCuomo	714246047644717057	2016-03-28T00:21:42	Not my intention. You were vague.  They are not the measure of the proper response. They are murderous apostates  
ChrisCuomo	714242188633317376	2016-03-28T00:06:22	Should have said "fairly well" - autotype.  
ChrisCuomo	714241563757518848	2016-03-28T00:03:53	Christians are being killed. Often more than you know.  But main targets of radical Islamists are still Muslims.  
ChrisCuomo	714241299445100544	2016-03-28T00:02:50	Who is they? All muslims? Really? 
ChrisCuomo	714240860469260288	2016-03-28T00:01:05	Arnold_August my reporting was on display there. Look at piece I did and points we made. Message is clear
ChrisCuomo	714240549537124354	2016-03-27T23:59:51	Arnold_August you made a crack about my shirt when it commemorates my pop and his resistance to regime...and who wants to be a WH plant?
ChrisCuomo	714240250244149248	2016-03-27T23:58:40	Bs. We ask for them on almost daily basis.  
ChrisCuomo	714240108313096192	2016-03-27T23:58:06	That jersey action past you is nice. What kind of boat? 
ChrisCuomo	714229117219172352	2016-03-27T23:14:25	Don't sing it; bring it  
ChrisCuomo	714228790898081794	2016-03-27T23:13:08	Explain? 
ChrisCuomo	714228641719304192	2016-03-27T23:12:32	cari_cariortiz3 no, daily well, yes. I was always watching. HappyEaster
ChrisCuomo	714228353587421186	2016-03-27T23:11:23	Arnold_August you insinuate I am pro regime which is silly and demonstrably false by reporting there and here. So you can answer that
ChrisCuomo	714165477656948736	2016-03-27T19:01:33	Many times. Many regions. For work and play.  
ChrisCuomo	714117204904710144	2016-03-27T15:49:43	You guys better figure it out. Division is a nonpartisan corrosion 
ChrisCuomo	714117060138237952	2016-03-27T15:49:09	Now more than ever. I worry about all the violence that angry words will force in months to come.

ChrisCuomo	714116639231447040	2016-03-27T15:47:29	meridionalss tough to accept your error. I know. You need to believe certain things to sustain your animus.  Smile and enjoy day
ChrisCuomo	714115866326118402	2016-03-27T15:44:24	mike_0504 stop being a cave man. Having served deserves great respect but doesn't mean u can disrespect others w/ impunity
ChrisCuomo	714115376200687616	2016-03-27T15:42:27	You dems face a division problem as well as GOP. how do you know HRC gets the Berners? 
ChrisCuomo	714115163138424832	2016-03-27T15:41:37	"Hear" is metaphor because it assumes absorbing living their truth 
ChrisCuomo	714114941733715968	2016-03-27T15:40:44	meridionalss no u didn't. U heard me question point of regime is if not to lift all up...meaning it shouldn't exist because it doesn't.
ChrisCuomo	714110206259683329	2016-03-27T15:21:55	But the Rock was a person...Peter as symbolic of the people  
ChrisCuomo	714107763387985920	2016-03-27T15:12:12	blacksmith1968 egg...you are the symbol of Easter. Live up to the billing dobetter or at least make sense.
ChrisCuomo	714101556614938628	2016-03-27T14:47:33	Only block if offend others. Bring it to me all day my man.  I pay a guy to beat me up and usually buy lunch after  
ChrisCuomo	714100847999918084	2016-03-27T14:44:44	Knowing the way very different than having the will to walk it  
ChrisCuomo	714100635520643073	2016-03-27T14:43:53	Fair point. Accepted and agreed. Keep me directed :) 
ChrisCuomo	714100396025913345	2016-03-27T14:42:56	This quote always bothered me. I get his point but is he right? 
ChrisCuomo	714100063048507392	2016-03-27T14:41:37	Thanks.  Was never gone. Was just looking on and shaking my head. now I can tell you why :) 
ChrisCuomo	714099824136728576	2016-03-27T14:40:40	Appreciated. And we both agree on what matters most: that is a handsome pup 
ChrisCuomo	714099422959902720	2016-03-27T14:39:04	BSull106 legit concern but embargo not working
ChrisCuomo	714098164760973314	2016-03-27T14:34:04	How often you kill the right metric? Virtues are the measure not just vices. We need to push positive acts  
ChrisCuomo	714097331201826819	2016-03-27T14:30:45	RARE is the Christian who walks the walk...but He expected us to fall short. Hence His sacrifice.  
ChrisCuomo	714096927302885376	2016-03-27T14:29:09	Town hall. That started it. That's where she called for others to do so and I challenged and got railed for days :) 
ChrisCuomo	714096716107096064	2016-03-27T14:28:19	Thanks.  key: say/challenge/put out there what is not appreciated. Popularity is fleeting. Relevance matters  
ChrisCuomo	714096235662221312	2016-03-27T14:26:24	Love Canada. Good people, diverse places.  
ChrisCuomo	714095902365974528	2016-03-27T14:25:05	I didn't miss it. But the deception and misdirected emotion is toxic and needs balance...so let's give it a go

ChrisCuomo	714094634616627200	2016-03-27T14:20:02	DMaxMJ NewDay I am the one who challenged Clinton on that. That's my point. Media not a monolith. Don't generalize.
ChrisCuomo	714094368110546950	2016-03-27T14:18:59	No offense, but having been to all three - and dozens of others - the USA is the standard for a reason  
ChrisCuomo	714094161952112640	2016-03-27T14:18:10	I was in Cuba but I don't think anyone did a better job on Brussels than CNN. Ez to criticize. Esp on here 
ChrisCuomo	714093615031697408	2016-03-27T14:15:59	Do you live the reason for the season? If so, then you are mistaken. Be the change. That's your focus  
ChrisCuomo	714093368960294914	2016-03-27T14:15:01	And out both of those in quotes. Literacy rate misleading. Healthcare there is not the standard you seek

ChrisCuomo	714092946526748674	2016-03-27T14:13:20	True but doesn't make problems elsewhere any less real. And I challenge you to find a better place than USA

ChrisCuomo	697729467779780608	2016-02-11T10:30:42	TEAM CUOMO WILL POST OUR PIC OF THE DAY DURING LENT
ChrisCuomo	697705249587531776	2016-02-11T08:54:28	The walk into my office on an early Thursday morning. Anyone in the office yet? 
ChrisCuomo	697480900976775169	2016-02-10T18:03:00	Hair out the way to show the sign of AshWednesday. Good deeds to come. No Twitter for a month. Peace! 
ChrisCuomo	697420473114689536	2016-02-10T14:02:52	High praise!  Gotta live the reason for the season. Lent 
ChrisCuomo	697416927032012801	2016-02-10T13:48:47	Lent is solemn and soulful...but not sad 
ChrisCuomo	697415824743755776	2016-02-10T13:44:24	Not venomous. Was intro'd as Cruz person. Be right or be quiet  
ChrisCuomo	697415605616513024	2016-02-10T13:43:32	Don't get why media or pols think they will damage trump by attacking his language. Supporters don't care. You need a better sell
ChrisCuomo	697412086620618752	2016-02-10T13:29:33	We do all the time. But a disparate field is a trump advantage  
ChrisCuomo	697404030419607552	2016-02-10T12:57:32	Sanders is not running in religion to be fair. He is about the populist message  
ChrisCuomo	697403802303991808	2016-02-10T12:56:38	I monitor so many sources all day long...I have plenty to keep me busy, including added volunteer efforts for Lent 
ChrisCuomo	697403465321025537	2016-02-10T12:55:17	You silly words aside - look who had trump on and how this morning... 
ChrisCuomo	697403287935565825	2016-02-10T12:54:35	Rubio bled support. Many decided in last 72 hrs and went for trump or Kasich. 89% said debate mattered in vote  
ChrisCuomo	697402912545357824	2016-02-10T12:53:06	DuprMe u don't get why what is an issue?
ChrisCuomo	697402630134493185	2016-02-10T12:51:58	But who is wowing you with ideas and solutions? Pols always choose the personal over policy 
ChrisCuomo	697402444620435456	2016-02-10T12:51:14	We hear this a lot. But people feel the promise is unfulfilled.  So it works for trump 
ChrisCuomo	697402034996248576	2016-02-10T12:49:36	Just one of few to look past the ugliness that comes with!  I think it matters. That said- off Twitter for Lent 
ChrisCuomo	697399676115488768	2016-02-10T12:40:14	don't win by just matching insults w/trump as u r now. U need someone to offer something that voters find better 
ChrisCuomo	697397471941685248	2016-02-10T12:31:28	This is misplaced criticism. Ask those who don't test him 
ChrisCuomo	697397315980627968	2016-02-10T12:30:51	Why? 
ChrisCuomo	697391148332150785	2016-02-10T12:06:21	trump is in command because GOP fractured an no one offering more to those who are angry 
ChrisCuomo	697389630702886912	2016-02-10T12:00:19	having trump on is responsible. giving him a pass is irresponsible. the frontrunner should be tested most 
ChrisCuomo	697389020846952448	2016-02-10T11:57:54	i can change a diaper with one hand. worked hard on that. my hands smallest of cuomo men. hear a lot abt that :) 
ChrisCuomo	697388791028445185	2016-02-10T11:56:59	...and that means not shading fact to benefit a perspective. i test trump because he is legit.  
ChrisCuomo	697388319085301761	2016-02-10T11:55:06	i think the label gets in the way...sanders pitch: shift in benefit and burden, to empower the middle class 
ChrisCuomo	697387907166904320	2016-02-10T11:53:28	i can do 40 days off twitter real ez.  good for you, Lent is about doing more not less... 
ChrisCuomo	697387086593318912	2016-02-10T11:50:12	crosstabs show strength with all portions of party. if you are anti trump fine but u have to recognize why dominant 
ChrisCuomo	697386657360842752	2016-02-10T11:48:30	friend, i am stating the true based on the exit polls. i am not a gop representative.  
ChrisCuomo	697386466297692160	2016-02-10T11:47:45	bush aint giving up. hear his plan on NewDay coming up 
ChrisCuomo	697386004328673281	2016-02-10T11:45:54	sure but u need to address WHY  winning. buch and mccain were insiders. he aint. trump is real. said it from jump 
ChrisCuomo	697383470583123968	2016-02-10T11:35:50	REJECTION OF STATUS QUO. NO ONE in gop field checks the box like realDonaldTrump I have told you this many times :) 
ChrisCuomo	697381706932862977	2016-02-10T11:28:50	welcome! and thank you for the NewDay love 
ChrisCuomo	697379794997088256	2016-02-10T11:21:14	best advice: dont pander to pc. reading negatives into neutrals. owning a vote is how u discuss demos 
ChrisCuomo	697379129373626368	2016-02-10T11:18:35	come on frankay even kasich said he would be a lousy veep. he is in it to win it  
ChrisCuomo	697373844584144896	2016-02-10T10:57:35	kasich and bush always presented as people gop'ers could see as president...but both probably dont go all the way 
ChrisCuomo	697373386222256128	2016-02-10T10:55:46	BIG NIGHT...more coverage! NewDay is there for you, you know that :) 
ChrisCuomo	697366991758368769	2016-02-10T10:30:21	We're in New York! And look who we brought back with us from New Hampshire! davidgregory 
ChrisCuomo	697333524748177408	2016-02-10T08:17:22	What happens in the newsroom when everyone works later than normal? PIZZA. It's 3:15am -- what's your breakfast? 
ChrisCuomo	697241622476673024	2016-02-10T02:12:11	NewHampshire don't obsess on #'s.  The most imp factor is WHY. See what drove voters to make choices. Stark pic for GOP. Big split for dems
ChrisCuomo	697241011521622016	2016-02-10T02:09:45	It never ends 
ChrisCuomo	697239801825783810	2016-02-10T02:04:57	ChrisCuomo, you've been calling like it is much faster then most all. A_Jolicoeur
ChrisCuomo	697237806318542848	2016-02-10T01:57:01	Not sure how Kasich can appease what voters expressing in exits but he is certainly electable in a general  
ChrisCuomo	697237486033104896	2016-02-10T01:55:45	True about south having significant # of evangelicals   
ChrisCuomo	697237224375640064	2016-02-10T01:54:42	Based on voter attitudes, not sure who in field can satisfy in way that unseats trump 
ChrisCuomo	697236828357861377	2016-02-10T01:53:08	NewHampshire question galvanizing because exits show voters angry at GOP &amp; supporting severe positions that play to trump talk, not center
ChrisCuomo	697236328556183553	2016-02-10T01:51:09	On dem side only good outcome for Clinton was if spread was less than 10. Sanders strong w/ women in early returns
ChrisCuomo	697231017590071297	2016-02-10T01:30:03	Everything in life can be expressed in Seinfeld terms. Net-net of nhprimary is that establishment field needs shrinkage to defeat Trump
ChrisCuomo	697235782084509696	2016-02-10T01:48:59	If realDonaldTrump north of 30%  -much stronger than even expected. Will take total galvanizing of rest of field and who says that happens?
ChrisCuomo	697235164238315521	2016-02-10T01:46:31	NewHampshire was always a battle for second. Kasich is not a fluke. Been saying this for months. If Rubio 5th...what a diff a week makes
ChrisCuomo	697231537985736707	2016-02-10T01:32:07	Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire becomes first Jewish primary winner ever  FeelTheBern 
ChrisCuomo	697225405267361793	2016-02-10T01:07:45	I don't see lent as diet time. That is not real deprivation it is playing to advantage. Gotta do more not less  
ChrisCuomo	697225207728238594	2016-02-10T01:06:57	LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL! 
ChrisCuomo	697224993525071874	2016-02-10T01:06:06	Suffer as sacrifice.  
ChrisCuomo	697224601592598528	2016-02-10T01:04:33	After the NewDay show tomorrow I will begin part of my Lenten sacrifice - NO TWITTER. I am also adding two types of volunteering. You?
ChrisCuomo	697223714501480448	2016-02-10T01:01:01	Election comes on FatTuesday meaning tomorrow the results come on AshWednesday ... Start of Lent.  Hidden significance thoughts?
ChrisCuomo	697208235728707584	2016-02-09T23:59:31	Strait talk is coming on at 7pm eastern. With Locs_n_Laughs . Primary coverage.
ChrisCuomo	697208411281182721	2016-02-10T00:00:13	This owl is cooler than most people I know  
ChrisCuomo	697209614622920704	2016-02-10T00:05:00	If you're still in line when the polls close, you have the right to vote. Don't go anywhere. State officials must keep the polls open.
ChrisCuomo	697209615147208704	2016-02-10T00:05:00	House Republicans won't even listen to POTUS's last budget ideas:  
ChrisCuomo	697206813570117633	2016-02-09T23:53:52	This is one of the reasons I respect ChrisCuomo as a journalist. Also, both of us from Queens :) 
ChrisCuomo	697206910571958273	2016-02-09T23:54:15	So we have established your research is flimsy by your own admission. Move along  
ChrisCuomo	697206470736277504	2016-02-09T23:52:30	See...why are you judging the son when u know nothing abt him.  Trump has good kids.  
ChrisCuomo	697206087502659584	2016-02-09T23:50:59	Fair point. I am biased on this 
ChrisCuomo	697205799169318912	2016-02-09T23:49:50	I am abt knowing not guessing. From early exits,seems we may see some new names in mix near top. too soon to know  
ChrisCuomo	697204236879339520	2016-02-09T23:43:38	Rubio et al who blocked said cost too much. Sanders said if it costs too much to help vets...don't send them to war 
ChrisCuomo	697202841614729216	2016-02-09T23:38:05	Let me say this once again - no morning show has had Sen Sanders on more than NewDay 
ChrisCuomo	697193957894328320	2016-02-09T23:02:47	crazytalk 
ChrisCuomo	697193554364518400	2016-02-09T23:01:11	No 
ChrisCuomo	697192767445925888	2016-02-09T22:58:03	Depends. That's why i am not a fan of kids in campaigns 
ChrisCuomo	697157832525901825	2016-02-09T20:39:14	I didn't hear this and I don't believe the candidates' kids should be targets 
ChrisCuomo	697157577709264897	2016-02-09T20:38:13	Be fair: Ia polls got tight at end and realDonaldTrump was not expected to win. He is expected to win big in NH 
ChrisCuomo	697113601614581763	2016-02-09T17:43:29	Libcrusher011 u think using that word makes u tough? Think you would say it to someone directly? My guess...no
ChrisCuomo	697113043658903552	2016-02-09T17:41:15	Then take that noise to them :) 
ChrisCuomo	697112869247143936	2016-02-09T17:40:34	U r sweet. I have fishing tackle older than you :) appreciate the generous assessment  
ChrisCuomo	697112437783265280	2016-02-09T17:38:51	U talking about rand or Ron ?   U don't get to combine them 
ChrisCuomo	697112275992227840	2016-02-09T17:38:12	Please. No one gets a pass on NewDay   That's why he visits our comp so much more often 
ChrisCuomo	697112079031906305	2016-02-09T17:37:26	U r wise  
ChrisCuomo	697112015190384645	2016-02-09T17:37:10	I agree and I echo the sentiment often in this cauldron of cruelty called Twitter  
ChrisCuomo	697111447508103168	2016-02-09T17:34:55	He certainly didn't lob ad hominems. But it was a bit of a stare down 
ChrisCuomo	697111092472864768	2016-02-09T17:33:30	Please. That was a joke. U people meant it when u called christie a party traitor for embracing prez post sandy 
ChrisCuomo	697109991262543873	2016-02-09T17:29:08	Humor? Hardly. Hear anyone else ask about it and challenge the notion as we did?   
ChrisCuomo	697109752275300352	2016-02-09T17:28:11	Where better? And why r crude insults considered candor? Criticism doesn't have 2b cruel. Harshness is not strength 
ChrisCuomo	697101028710346752	2016-02-09T16:53:31	Wow! Yes Imeegracia angelsary_l our kind of fashion too Classy/Sassy KateBolduan ChrisCuomo JohnBerman 😉

ChrisCuomo	697085422401359873	2016-02-09T15:51:30	Was sad when rand Paul made an issue of that in debate.  
ChrisCuomo	697071799599820800	2016-02-09T14:57:22	Irrational? Go google "panda attack" 
ChrisCuomo	697071487736479746	2016-02-09T14:56:08	Hey, Joel - thanks for the good words about Pop on Axe's podcast. He loved you...even though u were soft on D :) 
ChrisCuomo	697070633201569793	2016-02-09T14:52:44	What are you talking about? And stop being so hostile. If u r so heated come find me. We both live on the island.  
ChrisCuomo	697070315222994944	2016-02-09T14:51:28	Of course u can. And should!  This was a real sad commentary on toxic opposition in politics  
ChrisCuomo	697069564857884672	2016-02-09T14:48:29	Thanks for providing us an example of irrational negativity. Post-sandy handshake with the president is weakness? 
ChrisCuomo	697068939000619013	2016-02-09T14:46:00	I don't get how people do this job and not care about the people we cover in harm's way.

ChrisCuomo	697068263281463296	2016-02-09T14:43:19	The first two letters u chose proved my point. U tough typing phantoms are too often too little.  
ChrisCuomo	697068077016608768	2016-02-09T14:42:35	Is sanders a legit target for someone who takes wall st $? 
ChrisCuomo	697067904739713024	2016-02-09T14:41:54	Actually u can indict a ham sandwich. Spinning it is odd and sloppy 
ChrisCuomo	697065617283751938	2016-02-09T14:32:48	You get what you want.   
ChrisCuomo	697056842439069697	2016-02-09T13:57:56	One, it is being rewarded by GOP voters currently. Two, it only ends when the players offer something better 
ChrisCuomo	697054983800430592	2016-02-09T13:50:33	No we don't  
ChrisCuomo	697054889848000516	2016-02-09T13:50:11	So u should play to worst instinct to be popular? That's leadership? 
ChrisCuomo	697054551606697985	2016-02-09T13:48:50	Wrong. I have given both away 
ChrisCuomo	697054469922668544	2016-02-09T13:48:30	Who agrees? (With the result not the ribbing) 
ChrisCuomo	697054151642107904	2016-02-09T13:47:15	Provocative...but substantive? 
ChrisCuomo	697053831285370880	2016-02-09T13:45:58	So, I bring up the legitimacy of the suggestion and test the basis for it and I am getting sucked in? pfff

ChrisCuomo	697020345027588097	2016-02-09T11:32:54	proof is in performance. Cruz, bush etc respond in kind and often gain because of it.  Irrel if i think acceptable  
ChrisCuomo	697019770474995712	2016-02-09T11:30:37	In 1st?  Most see this as a battle for 2nd and any serious challenge to trump to come only when field smaller

ChrisCuomo	696685845965860864	2016-02-08T13:23:44	Some polls suggest they could be 2 and 3 with Cruz and Rubio behind them. Far fetched? How big would that be? 
ChrisCuomo	696685588188176384	2016-02-08T13:22:42	Remember it is as much about how much separation there is in field as his own finish 
ChrisCuomo	696685376816156672	2016-02-08T13:21:52	Other side is that if you don't dream big you wind up living small. Where is the line ? 
ChrisCuomo	696684703949131776	2016-02-08T13:19:11	Thanks. So many are commenting about Gov Bush being different and stronger. What was it exactly?

ChrisCuomo	696447206300258306	2016-02-07T21:35:28	Who agrees?

ChrisCuomo	696342884686131200	2016-02-07T14:40:55	"Alarmed" is your negative perception. Media plays to momentum because it is the fuel in an election  
ChrisCuomo	696342539104821248	2016-02-07T14:39:33	Polls disagree and now NH voters will lay another brick in foundation.  Does Rubio get stronger there? 
ChrisCuomo	696342054830542848	2016-02-07T14:37:37	But are you the minority in the GOP as Rubio continues to gain? 
ChrisCuomo	696341662168121345	2016-02-07T14:36:04	That's my point. What seems obvious to some does not resonate with all 
ChrisCuomo	696341355661025280	2016-02-07T14:34:51	That his choice  
ChrisCuomo	696340999019327488	2016-02-07T14:33:26	you want a media that judges words and actions through lens of wanting to diminish them? 
ChrisCuomo	696340663059795969	2016-02-07T14:32:06	1st - it was a town hall. I wasn't there to intv any candidate extensively. 2nd - HRC has more criticism it seems

ChrisCuomo	696339534930386944	2016-02-07T14:27:37	That make him unusual? 
ChrisCuomo	696339326326697984	2016-02-07T14:26:47	For GOP seems to be precisely about issues - and being as far right as possible to be outsider  
ChrisCuomo	696339164854423552	2016-02-07T14:26:08	So long? He was best known as "water grab" guy before he ran for prez, no?  
ChrisCuomo	696338923207991296	2016-02-07T14:25:11	But not a deal breaker for you? Who is 1st and 2nd choice at this point ? 
ChrisCuomo	696338794019213312	2016-02-07T14:24:40	Does he have your vote? 
ChrisCuomo	696337440605388800	2016-02-07T14:19:17	Many say this and yet his polls don't move. Why and will that change in NH? 
ChrisCuomo	696337259520516096	2016-02-07T14:18:34	Great way to prep before SB50 Watch DanMarino and CoyWire give me the scoop and rough me up on the street.

ChrisCuomo	696335320548294661	2016-02-07T14:10:52	Good for you! Avoid those who seek only discord.  Keep making your points  
ChrisCuomo	696334938765979648	2016-02-07T14:09:21	Offering a media account for comment shows no intent for such an allegation. Case dismissed 
ChrisCuomo	696334658812956672	2016-02-07T14:08:14	Insults are weakness. I am about strength. And no amount of tough questioning satisfies a candidate's critics  
ChrisCuomo	696334020100157440	2016-02-07T14:05:42	Then why is Rubio polling so much better than others? You think that changes? 
ChrisCuomo	696333234108555264	2016-02-07T14:02:34	Then why isn't kasich getting traction?  Will that change in NH?

ChrisCuomo	696332248925237248	2016-02-07T13:58:40	Rubio water gaffe moment years ago is back in circulation. Is Rubio still green or was it piling on last night? 
ChrisCuomo	696330970954362880	2016-02-07T13:53:35	Is all the criticism of Rubio a fair reflection of him, or just the state of play in piling on last night at debate?

ChrisCuomo	695454059319291906	2016-02-05T03:49:03	No, not happy about any of it. Just telling I the state of play. I look fed to Fbi findings  
ChrisCuomo	695453852015792129	2016-02-05T03:48:13	Yet when I asked Rubio about convening a scientific panel on the question - I got nowhere  
ChrisCuomo	695453646239051776	2016-02-05T03:47:24	I agree but we are in the MINORITY. Ernie has a lot of fans. A lot.  
ChrisCuomo	695408698361978882	2016-02-05T00:48:48	What a race. Problem is too much of what makes it exciting is negative  
ChrisCuomo	695408346178805763	2016-02-05T00:47:24	Not yet. And msg Carson released doesn't help. As saying goes, it ain't the crime that gets u, it's the cover up  
ChrisCuomo	695402384751636481	2016-02-05T00:23:43	authorlmendez even impartial anchors have personal opinions ChrisCuomo keeps his opinion to himself while on the air.

ChrisCuomo	695406631325052930	2016-02-05T00:40:35	I get that u support Cruz but u have to own the perfidy or u r incredible 
ChrisCuomo	695406401917550592	2016-02-05T00:39:40	There was at least one email from the  campaign saying it too. Carson hasn't stopped saying how bad it was 
ChrisCuomo	695399024178786304	2016-02-05T00:10:21	Seven things you should know about Marco Rubio:   1. He says everyone should have a gun to protect themselves... 
ChrisCuomo	695388187896614913	2016-02-04T23:27:18	"I'll receive the message and you can play the sender".  Name song and the band without google

ChrisCuomo	695385896766418951	2016-02-04T23:18:12	Please stop 
ChrisCuomo	695385706789613568	2016-02-04T23:17:26	Powell and Rice classified emails certainly blunt the charge that this is a problem unique to Clinton. Proof? Critics are quiet

ChrisCuomo	695350133752377344	2016-02-04T20:56:05	They get it - except when it tests their choice. Voters like to scrutinize but abhor the same scrutiny of them 
ChrisCuomo	695349914117623811	2016-02-04T20:55:13	Tough but fair on sanders. And clink internal link that shows trouble paying for hcare plan. Thoughts?

ChrisCuomo	695263966591873026	2016-02-04T15:13:41	tommyxtopher does a good job summing up the Ernie experience on NewDay called must see tv.

ChrisCuomo	695236284592291840	2016-02-04T13:23:41	after ernie i had to step up the sophistication  
ChrisCuomo	695236198500024320	2016-02-04T13:23:21	so what does it all mean to you? 
ChrisCuomo	695236017381588992	2016-02-04T13:22:38	ernie is getting WILD SUPPORT on my thread...what a woild 
ChrisCuomo	695235881704280066	2016-02-04T13:22:05	this is a silly notion - google negative stories on sanders and clinton and see which way the tally points.   
ChrisCuomo	695235081292492801	2016-02-04T13:18:54	ChrisCuomo I thought it best, after the fact. Voters were able to really see Bernie's weaknesses along w/ strengths; then comparing to HRC.
ChrisCuomo	695234202925690880	2016-02-04T13:15:25	why does clinton have to go second so she is on defensive from sanders charges?  see, it works both ways 
ChrisCuomo	695233947115085824	2016-02-04T13:14:24	who agrees? 
ChrisCuomo	695233733612412928	2016-02-04T13:13:33	like the one we just did asking about sanders bona fides and VA record with his press secretary? 
ChrisCuomo	695230063030177793	2016-02-04T12:58:58	u give good insult

ChrisCuomo	695228859277516800	2016-02-04T12:54:11	and yet he is getting WIDE RANGING support on my feed, including many women.

ChrisCuomo	695226309413335040	2016-02-04T12:44:03	he uses "progressive" not democrat 
ChrisCuomo	695220049288806400	2016-02-04T12:19:10	u r only missing the wings to be a complete angel :)  however my point stands! 
ChrisCuomo	695219435838312448	2016-02-04T12:16:44	u r decidedly anti-trump...but u think there is no there there with his cruz dirty trick rant? 
ChrisCuomo	695213727914803200	2016-02-04T11:54:03	look like jim carrey 
ChrisCuomo	695213440336531456	2016-02-04T11:52:55	opposition to practicality well known and reported...doesnt make them impossible esp if voters want them 
ChrisCuomo	695213195762524160	2016-02-04T11:51:56	pop is not a good measure...man had an allergy to pecuniary compensation. worst thing u could do was offer a big nut

ChrisCuomo	695208471747239936	2016-02-04T11:33:10	yes and i was roundly criticized for it by the berners :)  doctor says he is healthy and he seems robust, no? 
ChrisCuomo	695208220521005057	2016-02-04T11:32:10	ah, thank you. perfidy is clear...but idea that it changed outcome requires some numbas, no? 
ChrisCuomo	695207852357632000	2016-02-04T11:30:42	look at evangeicals on map, then look at the gop field...then move your chips closer to you :) 
ChrisCuomo	695207648313139200	2016-02-04T11:29:54	again...not sure it is the amount...it is the source, isnt it? 
ChrisCuomo	695207539244470272	2016-02-04T11:29:28	distinction would play in sentencing only probably, true. what is the relevance of this to me my friend?

ChrisCuomo	695206644016349185	2016-02-04T11:25:54	that would be fun, it would be arguably felonious. bad instinct.  
ChrisCuomo	695206424859787264	2016-02-04T11:25:02	do you have any basis for saying there was a real impact iowa from cruz chicanery?

ChrisCuomo	694908014491467776	2016-02-03T15:39:16	Not in politics.  
ChrisCuomo	694907722106585088	2016-02-03T15:38:06	Good on you. Thanks for the explainer. Will RT 
ChrisCuomo	694907421521788928	2016-02-03T15:36:54	Cruz says you are wrong. Tough to prove  
ChrisCuomo	694907330576674816	2016-02-03T15:36:33	Subjectivity becomes a big dividing line. GOP promising to remove ACA. Sanders going opposite way 
ChrisCuomo	694906872369905665	2016-02-03T15:34:43	Hard to expose "it won't get passed". it is a play for more government which has a challenge vs GOP and some dems 
ChrisCuomo	694904663196459008	2016-02-03T15:25:57	Or 6 
ChrisCuomo	694904517410873344	2016-02-03T15:25:22	How? By your actions...your devotion, your mercy - that is the instruction.  
ChrisCuomo	694892187310542849	2016-02-03T14:36:22	ChrisCuomo great question to the Reverend.  What is more important to talk about being a Christian or to act like one. Showing mercy?
ChrisCuomo	694902304982614017	2016-02-03T15:16:34	That's how we do on NewDay 
ChrisCuomo	694901420911378433	2016-02-03T15:13:04	I am not disputing what sanders says - that not making hcare payments will be net + ... Critics question the reality 
ChrisCuomo	694900885839859712	2016-02-03T15:10:56	Thank you for coming on NewDay Reverend. Hope we get to talk more about how to help the needy 
ChrisCuomo	694900617203048448	2016-02-03T15:09:52	Coin flipping is being exaggerated greatly in frequency, outcome and relevance 
ChrisCuomo	694885717521125377	2016-02-03T14:10:40	Yes. But isn't it a matter of opinion?  Secy state has not given official statement has it? 
ChrisCuomo	694885262833405952	2016-02-03T14:08:51	Provocative piece by smerconish . Thoughts?
ChrisCuomo	694879180991893505	2016-02-03T13:44:41	certainly not as the increased tax burden supports it  alone...so make the case and drop the invective 
ChrisCuomo	694878827286257664	2016-02-03T13:43:17	sanders fully believes in the potential for change, but pelosi shutting down his healthcare plan relevant 
ChrisCuomo	694878439053066241	2016-02-03T13:41:44	twitter full of nasty and all camps come at me with equal ugly when candidate tested. trumpets have slight edge 
ChrisCuomo	694878048500457472	2016-02-03T13:40:11	i dont think sanders' campaign made it a real issue and it isnt. 
ChrisCuomo	694877903931248641	2016-02-03T13:39:37	seems like a general theme doesnt it? 
ChrisCuomo	694877782564806657	2016-02-03T13:39:08	remember, i am one who pushed sanders' to run and test his ideas on his own party. only helps the process 
ChrisCuomo	694877478792335362	2016-02-03T13:37:55	but it doesnt move at all if there is no power in a direction, right? thats sanders' case 
ChrisCuomo	694877338690002944	2016-02-03T13:37:22	thanks for the love but i think journos should get the sides out there to be weighed by the rest 
ChrisCuomo	694876788082745345	2016-02-03T13:35:11	the mistake is to attack legit quez as bias. kohn answered the criticism ably - after a tad of a cheap shot :) 
ChrisCuomo	694876603961073664	2016-02-03T13:34:27	impossible? or possible if there is a mandate for the change? thats the sanders proposition 
ChrisCuomo	694876464211189760	2016-02-03T13:33:53	agreed! more voters more better. force candidates to speak to what matters  
ChrisCuomo	694876325937569792	2016-02-03T13:33:20	he overperformed most in iowa and tied trump. thats the fact 
ChrisCuomo	694876151190282242	2016-02-03T13:32:39	fair point. bernie's advocate made it. thats called testing. fair criticism: free hcare and college is pricey 
ChrisCuomo	694875918041550848	2016-02-03T13:31:43	relax - criticism of sanders FROM DEMS: free everything sounds good - costs a lot. period. advocates need to answer 
ChrisCuomo	694871626635198464	2016-02-03T13:14:40	differently? perhaps...but we both know that polls are powerful markers. suggestive, not predictive. 
ChrisCuomo	694871025222316033	2016-02-03T13:12:17	not NewDay that gave realDonaldTrump an open mike this morning. we test him and all. notice which ones come on 
ChrisCuomo	694869749344423936	2016-02-03T13:07:12	uncompelling 
ChrisCuomo	694869226742480896	2016-02-03T13:05:08	tell that to every campaign which uses and leans on them more than the media 
ChrisCuomo	694869001126682624	2016-02-03T13:04:14	ColinMcDaniel01 this is a 46L
ChrisCuomo	694868879844188161	2016-02-03T13:03:45	ah the empty cynicism of negativity 
ChrisCuomo	694866145258704897	2016-02-03T12:52:53	not going to happen. question is what standard u want to apply to a campaign... 
ChrisCuomo	694865368880398336	2016-02-03T12:49:48	cruz rep: cruz in center of gop. who running is to right of cruz?
ChrisCuomo	694864530850058240	2016-02-03T12:46:28	the pushback is that sanders says his plan would remove all current insurance payments from your carry 
ChrisCuomo	694864076128784384	2016-02-03T12:44:40	coop has bigger arms (and brain) and a smaller waist. oh, and also has WAY nicer threads. thats why he is  the man. 
ChrisCuomo	694863724218355712	2016-02-03T12:43:16	NewDay had a report from iraq, flint segment and almost a dozen other topics. who did more? 
ChrisCuomo	694863550905479169	2016-02-03T12:42:35	sometimes even when you dont :)  thanks for the good word 
ChrisCuomo	694863295803695104	2016-02-03T12:41:34	fundamentally our efforts should be directed to benefit u...thats why giving a pass to appease a pol is unacceptable 
ChrisCuomo	694861481523990529	2016-02-03T12:34:21	high praise 
ChrisCuomo	694857106785226752	2016-02-03T12:16:58	of "what not to do" - most dont court controversy. smart move :) 
ChrisCuomo	694856450594725888	2016-02-03T12:14:22	MANY getting this wrong. cointoss abt county delegates, no real relvance. bernie won almost all recorded tosses 
ChrisCuomo	694852772823457792	2016-02-03T11:59:45	ChrisCuomo pay her no mind. I'm a black gay man and you've responded to me many times. People need their 15mins on Twitter! Sad n shameful

ChrisCuomo	694851571432177664	2016-02-03T11:54:59	the impact is not known but the carson and mailer deceptions may become a narrative if candidates seize on it 
ChrisCuomo	694851282813722624	2016-02-03T11:53:50	ask yourself that and make sure your answer carries the weight of information and analysis 
ChrisCuomo	694850888503029760	2016-02-03T11:52:16	u r absolutely right...and there is a subjective component. who else has a light on flint today? 
ChrisCuomo	694849984534089732	2016-02-03T11:48:40	simple answer is more taxes, mostly on wealthy and "wall street" 
ChrisCuomo	694842869153206272	2016-02-03T11:20:24	people "play to advantage" in politics. how a candidate handles exposure of crossing the line can count 
ChrisCuomo	694842412322177024	2016-02-03T11:18:35	i am anti clinton pro clinton anti sanders pro sanders...all depends on YOUR mindset

ChrisCuomo	694683489581539330	2016-02-03T00:47:05	Cruz says telling voters Carson quitting and to vote for him was a mistake. Question is did he know this was the plan b4, during or after?

ChrisCuomo	694544874830438400	2016-02-02T15:36:16	So what? 
ChrisCuomo	694544448202674176	2016-02-02T15:34:35	marcorubio basically 2nd. Same delegs as trump. Def surprise. If in top 3 next 2 primaries- may force others out 
ChrisCuomo	694532084954763264	2016-02-02T14:45:27	.@SenSanders to ChrisCuomo:  “What this shows is that this campaign has started in a very forceful way.” 
ChrisCuomo	694530334252072960	2016-02-02T14:38:30	Notice the four that rank above terrorism in that list

ChrisCuomo	694484639596027904	2016-02-02T11:36:55	50+% of vote was for an outsider. That's GOP challenge 
ChrisCuomo	694484219351941120	2016-02-02T11:35:15	Or not. Was humble in defeat last night. It is a new day 
ChrisCuomo	694483869307912192	2016-02-02T11:33:51	True but sets stage esp on GOP side. Been all trump and others - not anymore. He has lead in nh but will it stick? 
ChrisCuomo	694483310651768832	2016-02-02T11:31:38	Welcome! 
ChrisCuomo	694483095152623616	2016-02-02T11:30:47	IowaCaucus doesn't pick president's is the adage but sets field. Trump has to share stage. Humble for 1st time 
ChrisCuomo	694482717937930240	2016-02-02T11:29:17	SO TRUE. Country is activated. Big turnout. Very different choices for voters. Not just trump anymore

ChrisCuomo	694232502857244673	2016-02-01T18:55:01	No question Clinton not named by any agency. This is a political problem at this point.   
ChrisCuomo	694230954748067840	2016-02-01T18:48:52	And even if charges no indication at this point would be vs Clinton.

ChrisCuomo	694194921604038657	2016-02-01T16:25:41	ChrisCuomo Right down the middle. My take.
ChrisCuomo	694208512662974464	2016-02-01T17:19:41	Insults are substitutes for insights on Twitter. Laugh it off

ChrisCuomo	694188426279555073	2016-02-01T15:59:52	Another take 
ChrisCuomo	694188388660809729	2016-02-01T15:59:43	One take 
ChrisCuomo	694187223843893250	2016-02-01T15:55:06	That is the Clinton argument. The other side is whether that's true and what was known  
ChrisCuomo	694186971170639874	2016-02-01T15:54:05	90% or more white 
ChrisCuomo	694186277386604544	2016-02-01T15:51:20	That's a false premise. Clinton's judgement has become an issue and will be regardless of outcome of investigation  
ChrisCuomo	694185886926241792	2016-02-01T15:49:47	Bernie people say I am pro Hillary and vice versa. Campaign is al about negative reactions. Not healthy.

ChrisCuomo	694144220047790080	2016-02-01T13:04:13	true but you must respect decisions as it stands until then not optional. where are laws to counter it?

ChrisCuomo	694139383511961601	2016-02-01T12:45:00	intrigue aside the question is whether it is a distinction without a difference at this point politically 
ChrisCuomo	694139207879639040	2016-02-01T12:44:18	dems and gop do it  counts votes. dems do proportionate delegate take 
ChrisCuomo	694139044213735424	2016-02-01T12:43:39	harkin says i am the first to ask him about it. he owned the situation and said not a factor 
ChrisCuomo	694138818962784256	2016-02-01T12:42:45	harkin matters here especially his opinion of who can getting things done.  
ChrisCuomo	694138641459875840	2016-02-01T12:42:03	hard to say anyone is free from blame. big problem is no real fix happening yet. 
ChrisCuomo	694138459649343488	2016-02-01T12:41:19	especially this year...such a robust ground game. turnout is being talked up but insiders say may be normal... 
ChrisCuomo	694138235749023744	2016-02-01T12:40:26	basically true but still true for harkin to say clinton has not been named. the political issue is very real 
ChrisCuomo	694137945138282496	2016-02-01T12:39:17	sorry but i is true that clinton isnt named as a target. if it were you you would want the distinction drawn. 
ChrisCuomo	694135707862962176	2016-02-01T12:30:23	true however...while not named by fbi, everything they are looking at necessarily concerns clinton directly.

ChrisCuomo	693905995316215809	2016-01-31T21:17:36	This makes you look silly. Trumpets attack me for testing trump. Try to tailor hate to your target.  
ChrisCuomo	693905522886623232	2016-01-31T21:15:43	The situation being politicized is easy. Investigations are hard. You may be preparing for disappointment

ChrisCuomo	693414994327781381	2016-01-30T12:46:32	KEY confusion.  Bigger discussion than 140 allows 
ChrisCuomo	693414865810112513	2016-01-30T12:46:01	True. First interaction with sen at CNN was over VA investigation and his insistence on change 
ChrisCuomo	693414390482235392	2016-01-30T12:44:08	Disagree on first; agree on second. Thanks for replies. Time to enjoy day. Be well :) 
ChrisCuomo	693414065104883712	2016-01-30T12:42:50	Demonstrably false. Hardest question of night was first one to HRC. Her camp last to agree to DemTownHall

ChrisCuomo	693413605941841920	2016-01-30T12:41:01	That's on you. Trump did not bring va issues to light.  
ChrisCuomo	693413418762661890	2016-01-30T12:40:16	I often say things to encourage disagreement. stating a proposition that is relevant doesn't mean it is my opinion  
ChrisCuomo	693413108824563712	2016-01-30T12:39:02	The decision is whether you are willing to trade popularity for impact. Not as easy as it may sound  
ChrisCuomo	693412924036096000	2016-01-30T12:38:18	I didn't see it but coop is CNN's main man for a reason.  He does the job very well

ChrisCuomo	693411715183157248	2016-01-30T12:33:30	EtreEtro I tell people not to call others liars. I tell them not to insult. Making an accusation is ez. Now do the hard part
ChrisCuomo	693411394557997056	2016-01-30T12:32:14	Same with you making all media obsessed with business. I could boost ratings in ways that we find unacceptable 
ChrisCuomo	693410764980379648	2016-01-30T12:29:43	No it isn't. Being ill isn't only vet issue. And everyone running says want to make VA better 
ChrisCuomo	693409511873331200	2016-01-30T12:24:45	I agree with the latter though  I don't see it set up as a false dichotomy  
ChrisCuomo	693409170096308224	2016-01-30T12:23:23	I agree with multiple sources. Human nature fuels the propensity to think what you believe is the truth 
ChrisCuomo	693408904936579072	2016-01-30T12:22:20	You are wrong on both fronts. Accusing me is ez. Show me an insult  
ChrisCuomo	693408742797361152	2016-01-30T12:21:41	Almost all major outlets cast a wide net 
ChrisCuomo	693408106370502656	2016-01-30T12:19:10	Even so he would not b unique in that regard, especially on vets  
ChrisCuomo	693407820297945088	2016-01-30T12:18:01	And the public? Fox caters to a perspective and is most watched cable. Audience bears no fault? Are you sheep? 
ChrisCuomo	693405354026147840	2016-01-30T12:08:13	ChrisCuomo Vets not only want policy,they want Action!
ChrisCuomo	693407502977875968	2016-01-30T12:16:46	Not definitively. Potentially? Yes. When you are absolute you exaggerate reality  
ChrisCuomo	693407234395619328	2016-01-30T12:15:42	Something being called a fact doesn't make it so 
ChrisCuomo	693407057643446272	2016-01-30T12:15:00	not a fact. would have to be a legal determination and there is none. You politicized it. That's the problem.  
ChrisCuomo	693406496240091136	2016-01-30T12:12:46	You say "bash" to distort situation. NewDay didn't bash him at all 
ChrisCuomo	693406062012153856	2016-01-30T12:11:02	ChrisCuomo @adilorenzo66 phalligan5 mjgbigfan Vets are used as a talking point  by politicians but at the end they seem to do the minimum
ChrisCuomo	693406138990252033	2016-01-30T12:11:21	That really is bs. He was entertaining conjecture and people jumped on him. Silly 
ChrisCuomo	693405950548508672	2016-01-30T12:10:36	The media checks trump. Some more than others. he rates regardless of how right he is  
ChrisCuomo	693405473287098369	2016-01-30T12:08:42	That would be controversial. But we are not close to that now. Just my stating that fact will bring a hate wave :) 
ChrisCuomo	693404938005778432	2016-01-30T12:06:34	Root problem obsession w/negativity -become a proxy for insight. Too much/many defined by what they are against 
ChrisCuomo	693404235904503808	2016-01-30T12:03:47	Not true. He is the only one who threw a fundraiser like this. Vets say they want policy ideas not sympathy  
ChrisCuomo	693404026776489984	2016-01-30T12:02:57	"Looks" very subject. Absent indictment - which seems unlikely - it won't matter to dems and damage built in to #'s 
ChrisCuomo	691834367577100288	2016-01-26T04:05:41	Thanks ChrisCuomo and CNN for a great DemTownHall. Another substantive discussion from Dems about how we can make Americans' lives better
ChrisCuomo	693403331927109632	2016-01-30T12:00:11	Pithy. This is not math. This is politics. Much of it is subjective. Passion is the fuel not fact 
ChrisCuomo	693402852304248833	2016-01-30T11:58:17	Certainly in my experience  
ChrisCuomo	693402704459251712	2016-01-30T11:57:42	That's my point - what u see as bs others see as vitally important. We are charged w/ vetting and balancing. Not ez 
ChrisCuomo	693402250153164800	2016-01-30T11:55:53	Ratings are a dirty word...but depends on how you get them. Pursuit of truth doesn't have to be compromised  
ChrisCuomo	693394870434660352	2016-01-30T11:26:34	Admirable request but politics- especially this cycle- is more about what people choose to believe is fact  
ChrisCuomo	693242595191975937	2016-01-30T01:21:29	On my shirt...but that's it. Can't be accused of undue influence  
ChrisCuomo	693241171091570688	2016-01-30T01:15:49	Eminent...mister facts :)  
ChrisCuomo	693152423028867072	2016-01-29T19:23:10	First, GORGEOUS pup. second, whenever you ask trump a tough question his peeps come a callin' - sometimes him too :) 
ChrisCuomo	693150430105309185	2016-01-29T19:15:15	Watch the difference in intvs and you will change your definition  
ChrisCuomo	693150201377394690	2016-01-29T19:14:20	If you are Irish, yes :) 
ChrisCuomo	693149979150520322	2016-01-29T19:13:27	Thanks but not an ego issue. Just the job. Trump likes to be tested by me. He just forgets that sometimes ;) 
ChrisCuomo	693149654540775424	2016-01-29T19:12:10	Not a gottam drop. Tutto Italiano ! 
ChrisCuomo	693149527856058368	2016-01-29T19:11:40	Tough one! Panthers are strong and high strung.  Peyton is an underdog and may be headed out... 
ChrisCuomo	693149197550403585	2016-01-29T19:10:21	Parents were friends. And we have a good relationship, despite my ersatz designation as trump hating libtard :) 
ChrisCuomo	693148715524161536	2016-01-29T19:08:26	Nope. He donated after the gma event at his hotel on his own behalf - making your conflict attack empty negativity  
ChrisCuomo	693148475710664705	2016-01-29T19:07:29	Trying to limit the sauce as much as possible. Helmets mess up my 'doo 
ChrisCuomo	693148231874822144	2016-01-29T19:06:31	All day. So pumped!  Flying to Cali and back in a day basically to do it  
ChrisCuomo	693148121673682946	2016-01-29T19:06:04	Nevah! They kill clothes. Pop gave me steamer for suits and even washed shirts so last longer. Now hours too harsh. 
ChrisCuomo	693147484818948097	2016-01-29T19:03:33	Punctuation can't save a salvo, counselor. Why contribute to the hate parade? 
ChrisCuomo	693147053233475584	2016-01-29T19:01:50	We'll see - headed that way for super bowl special with Dan Marino.  
ChrisCuomo	693146819409371139	2016-01-29T19:00:54	JaredBeck remember what Felix said about assuming? You just proved it
ChrisCuomo	693146556883718148	2016-01-29T18:59:51	Would never pay that for jeans 
ChrisCuomo	693142581438464001	2016-01-29T18:44:04	The supporters on here are 100% worse than anything in actual election  
ChrisCuomo	693142352014266369	2016-01-29T18:43:09	iava says that's exactly what they would do. So how much you wagering? 
ChrisCuomo	693141282248593408	2016-01-29T18:38:54	This account has been a long time coming :) 
ChrisCuomo	693140692986634241	2016-01-29T18:36:33	Jacket and jeans ... Not for me  
ChrisCuomo	693140444163764224	2016-01-29T18:35:34	This election has been one big crisis if you think about it...one negative event after the other  
ChrisCuomo	693140138696794112	2016-01-29T18:34:21	BYOP? just bring cash 
ChrisCuomo	693140009323470849	2016-01-29T18:33:50	Seems like so long ago. Can't remember if I was crushed for this one by him/Trumpets. I am sure you'll remind me :) 
ChrisCuomo	693139300398030849	2016-01-29T18:31:01	Both. My thread filled with angry assaults for and vs Bernie Hillary Donald Ted even Jeb 
ChrisCuomo	693138530051186688	2016-01-29T18:27:58	Only for huckabee. There is no free lunch. Or breakfast. But still come  
ChrisCuomo	693138265201889280	2016-01-29T18:26:54	That's one argument - and many are being made, which is why some vets groups were wary of inclusion 
ChrisCuomo	693138109580591104	2016-01-29T18:26:17	One problem is tweeting me for no reason. What are you talking about? 
ChrisCuomo	693130247580061696	2016-01-29T17:55:03	Iowa &amp; New Hampshire: NewDay is coming! If you're nearby, come have pancakes w/ ChrisCuomo &amp; AlisynCamerota! 
ChrisCuomo	693137726414143488	2016-01-29T18:24:46	rapidbrook judging by your thread you have plenty of free time.
ChrisCuomo	693136948240715777	2016-01-29T18:21:40	Of course! I am flattered by the attn.  enjoy the weekend. Let me know how I look on Iowa and New Hampshire... 
ChrisCuomo	693080003211350016	2016-01-29T14:35:24	Insults are counterproductive but they don't automatically make someone a bully. Don't abuse that card 
ChrisCuomo	693079561941184513	2016-01-29T14:33:39	All symptoms, yes. Add the frantic furious and feckless tweets by rabid supporters ON BOTH SIDES pre caucuses 
ChrisCuomo	693072374401339392	2016-01-29T14:05:05	Who wants pancakes? See NewDay live in Iowa Mon 5-8amCT MarsCafe &amp; New Hampshire Tue WaterworksCafe 5:30-9amET 
ChrisCuomo	693065207145500672	2016-01-29T13:36:36	never. and raising $ for vets is great, but is that the sole basis for evaluating?   
ChrisCuomo	693064425780187136	2016-01-29T13:33:30	carson says debates are like  ancient rome and lust for coliseum while outside the city is in ruins. agree?
ChrisCuomo	693062107768578048	2016-01-29T13:24:17	Morning_Joe &amp; morningmika seldom focus on Ideas &amp; platforms of presidential candidates vs the horse race. Preferring NewDay &amp;ChrisCuomo
ChrisCuomo	693063895674699776	2016-01-29T13:31:23	no proof of what you say. let's let facts speak. plenty of other issues to harp on in this elex 
ChrisCuomo	693063530820583425	2016-01-29T13:29:56	not wrong to have it go to a central place for distribution. trump gave 20k to charity for me to trump off his hotel 
ChrisCuomo	693062911426691072	2016-01-29T13:27:29	you are prescient when you arent even trying!  who wins super bowl? 
ChrisCuomo	693061012837265412	2016-01-29T13:19:56	sam clovis from trump camp says they have 6mm or more and it wil go to vets groups. we will see 
ChrisCuomo	693057454679134208	2016-01-29T13:05:48	this is simple: trump says $6mm raised. we wait for proof as we always do. his campaign on NewDay now. let's see. 
ChrisCuomo	693056955556982784	2016-01-29T13:03:49	another take 
ChrisCuomo	693056898954825728	2016-01-29T13:03:35	one take... 
ChrisCuomo	693056652631740416	2016-01-29T13:02:37	says mister false allegation about the vets group? dont be a hypocrite. we challenge the donation when we have facts 
ChrisCuomo	693055736029519872	2016-01-29T12:58:58	SpiralTraveler5 i know you are protective of sanders. just fyi...he and his campaign call our coverage fair. all the time.
ChrisCuomo	693055096536588288	2016-01-29T12:56:26	RyanLizza offered that suggestion on NewDay ... is trump getting a pass? 
ChrisCuomo	693054926658912256	2016-01-29T12:55:45	dont make his kids an issue. you dont know the facts i would wager, and it is irrevlenat 
ChrisCuomo	693054767162093568	2016-01-29T12:55:07	he says you are wrong. the choice of who is right goes to you and other voters 
ChrisCuomo	693054585766834176	2016-01-29T12:54:24	we have nothing proven on that allegation. plenty known facts to ask about and we did 
ChrisCuomo	693054431043178496	2016-01-29T12:53:47	you talking about trump? 
ChrisCuomo	693054323744464896	2016-01-29T12:53:21	dont use vets in media rant. poor form. not about wanting the $ or not, it is about absence of policy ideas for them 
ChrisCuomo	693053904041463808	2016-01-29T12:51:41	i agree about coop but the idea that i pander to trump is demonstrably false. really crazy talk 
ChrisCuomo	693053435197984770	2016-01-29T12:49:49	people differ on that but what certainly is true that vets need more and better solutions  
ChrisCuomo	693045113329688577	2016-01-29T12:16:45	funny - i raised that issue and the trumpets are all over me...once again. rule now is: question a candidate=bias 
ChrisCuomo	693044864691392512	2016-01-29T12:15:46	look, raising $ for vets is an unqualified + but there is room for skepticism and quez abt policy ideas for vets 
ChrisCuomo	693043666873663488	2016-01-29T12:11:00	u want to distract from motivation but it is a legit quez. of course $ for vets groups is good. thats no the point 
ChrisCuomo	693043343052427264	2016-01-29T12:09:43	obviously trump picks outlets by ease of intv. good ques is whether fox really apologized to trump last night.  
ChrisCuomo	693042724627419136	2016-01-29T12:07:16	first two parts demonstrably true. active voters in iowa...prone to thinking it thru until caucus night 
ChrisCuomo	693040274742874112	2016-01-29T11:57:32	fact: she didnt disagree. she said money is good but specific plans on how to help better.  
ChrisCuomo	693039810664120320	2016-01-29T11:55:41	send proof please 
ChrisCuomo	693039405167149056	2016-01-29T11:54:04	who agrees with this trump supporter? 
ChrisCuomo	693039004795736064	2016-01-29T11:52:29	BrandonDusch to extract something useful from a silly tweet, paying more taxes may be accepted if the plan for $ makes sense to voters
ChrisCuomo	692840859142717440	2016-01-28T22:45:07	ChrisCuomo  Amen. That is so true! You were awesome the other night, did you get my flowers? LOL, I meant the debate! lol
ChrisCuomo	692868407767597057	2016-01-29T00:34:35	Then you know you are being u fair, especially to NewDay

ChrisCuomo	692838097990524932	2016-01-28T22:34:09	Ratings are a reflection of choices by the voters about what they want. You want the media to decide for them now? 
ChrisCuomo	692837160022466562	2016-01-28T22:30:25	having a negative opinion doesn't make someone a troll 
ChrisCuomo	692836777309007876	2016-01-28T22:28:54	JarrodCurrin you are easily persuaded
ChrisCuomo	692836273422086144	2016-01-28T22:26:54	B9lyEquivocal so you choose to employ the same standard as these people?
ChrisCuomo	692791807877496837	2016-01-28T19:30:13	A hitler reference? Don't you think the holocaust deserves the respect of not being an analogy? 
ChrisCuomo	692791378259107840	2016-01-28T19:28:30	Anarchist? Or like most you don't like some aspects but say you reject all? 
ChrisCuomo	692790974125318144	2016-01-28T19:26:54	More hollow negativity.  
ChrisCuomo	692788903015759873	2016-01-28T19:18:40	Even agreement is slanted to negative :) 
ChrisCuomo	692788730973790209	2016-01-28T19:17:59	Another negative reference that distracts from the need for competing ideas re solutions to real problems

ChrisCuomo	692787252691337218	2016-01-28T19:12:07	Dunno. But he put Cruz in crosshairs of many in debate tonight hoping to catch him in NH 
ChrisCuomo	692786699663970304	2016-01-28T19:09:55	niteowlmom3 explain?
ChrisCuomo	692786595104210944	2016-01-28T19:09:30	Trump studiously tries not to sound "presidential" ...That is part of the sell. Wonder if he would shift in general? 
ChrisCuomo	692786131457478656	2016-01-28T19:07:39	Or parts of both. Too many are extreme on social media: best, worst, genius, jackass...modulation is out moded 
ChrisCuomo	692785525497929728	2016-01-28T19:05:15	So does the US. you think there are no unmarked cars in Eu? 
ChrisCuomo	692785183725088768	2016-01-28T19:03:53	rmethod that is a blog or righty radio talking, not reality. Refusing to condemn all Muslims is not tantamount to excusing terror

ChrisCuomo	692784531586310145	2016-01-28T19:01:18	U are assuming trump gets 0% of non republicans but u point to a real issue of out party appeal

ChrisCuomo	692779036733521920	2016-01-28T18:39:28	Seriously? You don't get the need for unmarked cars?  
ChrisCuomo	692778921964769280	2016-01-28T18:39:00	Can you point to a period like that? 
ChrisCuomo	692778799981826048	2016-01-28T18:38:31	Why do you look at this as a political situation? It is a man bent on murder. There is no "take" to have.  Wise up 
ChrisCuomo	692778313492905985	2016-01-28T18:36:35	We have heard that before and it has not happened. Trump close to 40% in GOP polls.

ChrisCuomo	692769345789923328	2016-01-28T18:00:57	action taken and the language used warrants it...by the way, kelly no fan of mine either so this isn't personal :)

ChrisCuomo	692764468292509696	2016-01-28T17:41:34	realDonaldTrump would point out those were casinos not him personally and he sees Bruptcy as using system well

ChrisCuomo	692682814928633856	2016-01-28T12:17:07	many reasons...but isnt it good to have a range of ideas to drive debate? 
ChrisCuomo	692682482622275585	2016-01-28T12:15:47	fox news does play to conservatives by design. not a secret. trump being vs fox not same as being anti media 
ChrisCuomo	692678489409986560	2016-01-28T11:59:55	terrible comparison 
ChrisCuomo	692678384543997952	2016-01-28T11:59:30	erikblair and pelosi JUST SAID single payer wont happen in context of bigger government being a no-go...
ChrisCuomo	692677809869852672	2016-01-28T11:57:13	the counter is tax dollars pay for the jobs..."make work"... but the benefit to improvements obvious 
ChrisCuomo	692677538536120320	2016-01-28T11:56:09	agreed. i have been there when it happens...and that is a horrible way to make needed change 
ChrisCuomo	692677373121134593	2016-01-28T11:55:29	agree, but when you look at success w/ bond issues to pay and how it plays in elex...u see why it doesnt happen more 
ChrisCuomo	692676326579396608	2016-01-28T11:51:20	HNLbob wanting to fix the problem is good...but will they? Flint
ChrisCuomo	692674326777196544	2016-01-28T11:43:23	how fun is that show? 
ChrisCuomo	692674129376514048	2016-01-28T11:42:36	dont have to guess...he says no. holding an event to benefit vets 
ChrisCuomo	692673873368727553	2016-01-28T11:41:35	tell pelosi...and as always, the young have the biggest reason to vote...yet they historically underperform 
ChrisCuomo	692535522275790848	2016-01-28T02:31:49	Infrastructure doesn't score political points and gets used as a "big spender" salvo.  
ChrisCuomo	692534994108030978	2016-01-28T02:29:43	carmenlezeth ChastityBelt33 I was enjoying the silliness...but now you have me. It is over
ChrisCuomo	692517840218411008	2016-01-28T01:21:34	I rule it out. Now on to more important things. What's REM's best album?  1/ Murmur 2/ Reckoning or 3/ Fables?  
ChrisCuomo	692533580128321536	2016-01-28T02:24:06	Flint’s water crisis “is the result of decades of systemic disinvestment in poor black cities.” 
ChrisCuomo	692531095112384513	2016-01-28T02:14:14	like to engage different, and sometimes wrong, views. That said -wore jacket for kids. 2 out of 3 said too tight :(  
ChrisCuomo	692530669386383361	2016-01-28T02:12:32	GrahamMcGinnis you can do better
ChrisCuomo	692530143894568961	2016-01-28T02:10:27	GrahamMcGinnis that's silly. the voters asked the questions. No one has had sanders on more than NewDay.
ChrisCuomo	692529408599531520	2016-01-28T02:07:32	Grazie - lei non apprezza la moda italiana 
ChrisCuomo	692528892712718338	2016-01-28T02:05:29	That's unfair and untrue. There is a sense that being mean is being tough...it isn't.  
ChrisCuomo	692526693769166848	2016-01-28T01:56:44	PitbullGirl_902 welcome to the NewDay circus

ChrisCuomo	692526259776151552	2016-01-28T01:55:01	It was a blazer and slacks. Be accurate when you are being nasty.  
ChrisCuomo	692451240719077377	2016-01-27T20:56:55	JulioGugui this is interesting and he is compelling but it is not accurate
ChrisCuomo	692448220849553409	2016-01-27T20:44:55	I will have you know a salesman at a high-end haberdasher just told me it looked great.  So there :)

ChrisCuomo	692408904714719232	2016-01-27T18:08:41	Sanders is not a ducker in my experience. Let's see how this plays out  
ChrisCuomo	692408430393425920	2016-01-27T18:06:48	Those are immaterial comparisons...I mean in terms of their campaigns 
ChrisCuomo	692407920076656640	2016-01-27T18:04:47	He may be the oldest prez elected EVER and hasn't released his medical records. Legit q and he handled well

ChrisCuomo	692406732920877057	2016-01-27T18:00:04	suicideslastca1 good line. "Tax and spend" is a divisive tactic. This is not new.
ChrisCuomo	692406298722373632	2016-01-27T17:58:20	How so? 
ChrisCuomo	692406108107964416	2016-01-27T17:57:35	I think those two men are about as dissimilar as you get  
ChrisCuomo	692405825193795584	2016-01-27T17:56:27	@cbirobin questions are tailored to specific candidates in debates all the time
ChrisCuomo	692405651784466433	2016-01-27T17:55:46	Issue was, forum not set up for me to grill candidates. Was about voters' quez primarily. And thank ur pop 
ChrisCuomo	692405122119405568	2016-01-27T17:53:40	It's not an act :)  
ChrisCuomo	692403324054867968	2016-01-27T17:46:31	Then you should change your account :) interesting how diff the conflict dynamic is on the left 
ChrisCuomo	692402950036144128	2016-01-27T17:45:02	Either way this is going to be a particularly bitter contest. Country at a cross roads? 
ChrisCuomo	692402719672418309	2016-01-27T17:44:07	Certainly not boring. Thanks for the good word 
ChrisCuomo	692401660828762114	2016-01-27T17:39:54	Speak for yourself :) There is a real need for new ideas and leaders who can unify. This drama isn't helping  
ChrisCuomo	692394055083388928	2016-01-27T17:09:41	ChrisCuomo Geoffrey2313819 I thought it was GREAT 4 all! I actually got info from Bernie &amp; noticed OMalley! OMalley needs to try in 4-8 yr
ChrisCuomo	692400489451929600	2016-01-27T17:35:15	He plays rough and admits it. Question is whether this move goes too far. Up to you  
ChrisCuomo	692400164934393856	2016-01-27T17:33:58	If you don't think there are people who oppose the idea of more taxes especially in top brackets, go ask around  
ChrisCuomo	692399900575797248	2016-01-27T17:32:55	Because? 
ChrisCuomo	692399806912860160	2016-01-27T17:32:32	Many FeelTheBern -ers liked hearing Bernie discuss his family. And most viewers say the DemTownHall was helpful 
ChrisCuomo	692399037736210438	2016-01-27T17:29:29	realDonaldTrump has a gift for political strategy and persuasion. One of the best I have seen

ChrisCuomo	692397399550119936	2016-01-27T17:22:58	So people candidates like are the only people who can moderate debates? 
ChrisCuomo	692345819962445824	2016-01-27T13:58:01	AFineBlogger . Lol. I know. NewDay CNN ChrisCuomo  is interviewing people in Iowa and Fox was showing how to remove lint with baby wipes
ChrisCuomo	692396691589324800	2016-01-27T17:20:10	I have heard your sentiment about the pejorative used all morning. Doubt you will read or hear it from him again  
ChrisCuomo	692396188528697344	2016-01-27T17:18:10	We did. More than once. And had a reporter on site. NewDay 
ChrisCuomo	692395964796108800	2016-01-27T17:17:16	I heard the same in comments from his campaign manager. Very few think kelly question at debate should be the issue

ChrisCuomo	692393759552749568	2016-01-27T17:08:30	suicideslastca1 I asked about a common criticism of sanders. That's doesn't make it my opinion. See the difference now?
ChrisCuomo	692392856703623169	2016-01-27T17:04:55	She does a different job, as does joe. As for his apparent accusation re her...that's for you to judge

ChrisCuomo	692330661043113984	2016-01-27T12:57:47	crazy talk! i have worn sneakers on set. he never does. JohnBerman is much more fashion savvy. much 
ChrisCuomo	692330375935311872	2016-01-27T12:56:39	i reject what you say...because it is true :) 
ChrisCuomo	692330137988239360	2016-01-27T12:55:42	kelly is a force at fox news and a talented pundit but what did she do to trump that was wrong exactly? 
ChrisCuomo	692329813261041666	2016-01-27T12:54:25	i think all three had a great chance to make their best pitch to actual voters. that was the goal. not a debate.

ChrisCuomo	691681954052182016	2016-01-25T18:00:03	More a criticism for media. Voters should ask whatever they want however they want, right? DemTownHall

ChrisCuomo	690162242009042944	2016-01-21T13:21:15	saw this. so what will happen? 
ChrisCuomo	690158889577365505	2016-01-21T13:07:56	ChrisCuomo Good point. David Foster Wallace had a similar critique on corrosive use of irony: 
ChrisCuomo	690161491031527424	2016-01-21T13:18:16	donation to campaign? cruz wife works and goldman. he got loan from there and another big bank. anti establishment? 
ChrisCuomo	690161118870945796	2016-01-21T13:16:47	trump says not true 
ChrisCuomo	690156494290063360	2016-01-21T12:58:25	u cant even compliment without snark. why even tweet? 
ChrisCuomo	690155870785769472	2016-01-21T12:55:56	functionally same thing. exposure to the water can make them sick 
ChrisCuomo	690155593622011904	2016-01-21T12:54:50	yes, many have plans but narrative is about negatives on candidates 
ChrisCuomo	690155258509672448	2016-01-21T12:53:30	but the priority must be fixing first. 
ChrisCuomo	690155161046630404	2016-01-21T12:53:07	hiding the problem is not the way to go. do you believe there is proof it is overblown? FlintWaterCrisis 
ChrisCuomo	690154217063981057	2016-01-21T12:49:22	i did. he disputes the data but admits there is a water issue...his point is media making too much of it 
ChrisCuomo	690153884036272128	2016-01-21T12:48:03	u dont ignore dissent; u test it and using fact and argument to enable the judgment of the viewer 
ChrisCuomo	690153476744159232	2016-01-21T12:46:25	he says he is 
ChrisCuomo	690145556107231233	2016-01-21T12:14:57	no "kind of" to it. think about it: the more confident you are in something the less you care about who disagrees 
ChrisCuomo	690144565605613569	2016-01-21T12:11:01	an issue and at least being tracked. the VA has no NEW problems. this is decades of systemic trouble 
ChrisCuomo	690144350400045058	2016-01-21T12:10:10	if that is your case for trump's plan to make america great(er)...that is not a great case 
ChrisCuomo	690144147458629632	2016-01-21T12:09:21	certainly not 1 person. many factors speak to markets 
ChrisCuomo	690143889987092480	2016-01-21T12:08:20	100% and he is right to this point. anyone who questions trump's intelligence is off. 
ChrisCuomo	690143481331851264	2016-01-21T12:06:42	fact: there is an inverse relationship between the strength of a point and the use of insults 
ChrisCuomo	690143184773603332	2016-01-21T12:05:32	point is he is a private citizen and i am not going to make his health news. his mom makes her own choice 
ChrisCuomo	690142471528058881	2016-01-21T12:02:42	taxpayers 
ChrisCuomo	690142086012747777	2016-01-21T12:01:10	i dont judge illness and we dont know all the facts. addiction and ptsd often related 
ChrisCuomo	690139791007047682	2016-01-21T11:52:03	first responders also. everyday people who experience trauma. his was a cheap shot that cheapened the issue 
ChrisCuomo	690138860723015680	2016-01-21T11:48:21	wrong (shock). and what i did experience made me an expert in the risks.

ChrisCuomo	690138471793557504	2016-01-21T11:46:48	weak. dont need to serve to u-stand ptsd. many others experience it. i have lived it on the battlefield and off 
ChrisCuomo	690138202196279296	2016-01-21T11:45:44	semper preparandum. but i dont know all the facts so i dont judge.  
ChrisCuomo	690137648711778304	2016-01-21T11:43:32	IamSuz me. always me. blizzard. markets. poll reliability. politics. and we dont just echo trump like other shows
ChrisCuomo	690137327495204867	2016-01-21T11:42:15	and yet we have reported on ptsd for years. consistently. ask why you didnt care until palin played blame game? 
ChrisCuomo	690136911965458432	2016-01-21T11:40:36	probably same split as every other partisan divide...thats the problem... 
ChrisCuomo	690136663767584769	2016-01-21T11:39:37	what does that mean? trump is very light on "how" - thats a fact. how much  that matters is up to you 
ChrisCuomo	690136336582492160	2016-01-21T11:38:19	gop was vs iran deal cuz knew oil prices would tank? oil is in a glut but also big unwinding of commodity securities 
ChrisCuomo	690135984890077185	2016-01-21T11:36:55	give me facts. show how the president is responsible for ptsd or for the market correction but not the 7 yr bull run 
ChrisCuomo	690135762617122817	2016-01-21T11:36:02	7 yr bull market 
ChrisCuomo	690135394306932736	2016-01-21T11:34:34	ptsd is beyond a parent control...but politicizing the illness is doesnt serve the goal of getting help 
ChrisCuomo	690134532939497472	2016-01-21T11:31:09	do you credit thew president for the 7 yr bull market or just the current correction? market juicing started b4 him

ChrisCuomo	689927620205658112	2016-01-20T21:48:57	Thx for nice sentiment. Parenting is good but ain't ez. That's what my personwhochangedmylife piece is abt Friday  
ChrisCuomo	689926533260169216	2016-01-20T21:44:38	I don't. This a chance for voters to see candidates address their specific concerns. It is what it is  
ChrisCuomo	689925943650078721	2016-01-20T21:42:17	Friday. Have enjoyed all so far. Mine goes in a different direction but I think it will resonate  
ChrisCuomo	689893618774102016	2016-01-20T19:33:50	Amen.  
ChrisCuomo	689892920745410560	2016-01-20T19:31:04	We don't know that. Treatment got screwed up. Now lines corroded. That goes to competence.cover up ones to politics

ChrisCuomo	689892035244003328	2016-01-20T19:27:33	timing and priority. When your house is on fire do you want to debate the level of service? People are in crisis 
ChrisCuomo	689891623279423489	2016-01-20T19:25:55	This is about the treatment and infrastructure. Feds can help. Experts can help.  
ChrisCuomo	689891406664572928	2016-01-20T19:25:03	Then where is the plan for all the talk about political cost?  
ChrisCuomo	689890618999488513	2016-01-20T19:21:55	I never have and never will. This is real. I don't put on a face. My fairness is real too 
ChrisCuomo	689890319161237504	2016-01-20T19:20:44	Not true. And Gov just owned it now and blew open all prior suspicions.  
ChrisCuomo	689890090890428417	2016-01-20T19:19:49	Priorities. Ratio of political action to fixing action out of whack. Fix FlintWaterCrisis then hold to account 
ChrisCuomo	689889719283511298	2016-01-20T19:18:21	There is a potential ph level mistake Flint that damaged lines.   Lead lines not unusual and can be safe Flint 
ChrisCuomo	689888877545390080	2016-01-20T19:15:00	Maybe there'll be numerous and various levels of accountability but that ain't fixing the immediate problem Flint 
ChrisCuomo	689871890589024260	2016-01-20T18:07:30	Concern is real. NewDay on it daily 
ChrisCuomo	689871667909267456	2016-01-20T18:06:37	In a crisis, you prioritize immediate risk: water STILL dangerous. Fix it. Then hold people to account Flint 
ChrisCuomo	689871275628584961	2016-01-20T18:05:03	Fix the water if you want to help the people. Politics is a distraction right now  
ChrisCuomo	689870241296453632	2016-01-20T18:00:57	You have to look at who did the testing and who checked on them. need to get right people to solve problem ASAP  
ChrisCuomo	689869666601340929	2016-01-20T17:58:40	SO happy that you are doing the townhall on Monday Chris, about time! ListenToIowans PureDemocracy CNN

ChrisCuomo	689868943297794053	2016-01-20T17:55:47	Seeing this thru lens of politics is sad and destructive to fixing Flint 
ChrisCuomo	689868658361892864	2016-01-20T17:54:39	Correction? Maybe. Collapse? No proof. Let's see earnings over next few weeks.  Risk is real, fear a choice  
ChrisCuomo	689868212062781440	2016-01-20T17:52:53	Better...town hall where Iowans take what is happening in their lives to candidates for answers. Pure democracy  
ChrisCuomo	689867897250934784	2016-01-20T17:51:38	This is much more complex than one bad guy and blame game is distracting from fixing FlintWaterCrisis 
ChrisCuomo	689867649082396672	2016-01-20T17:50:39	Some holes in the analysis admittedly but point that "fix first, fight later" is well taken FlintWaterCrisis 
ChrisCuomo	689865472037294084	2016-01-20T17:42:00	State was told and resisted.  
ChrisCuomo	689865346350718976	2016-01-20T17:41:30	This will make you angry. What you do with that anger is what matters. Call for action in Flint

ChrisCuomo	689804831024881666	2016-01-20T13:41:02	it is balance...people go negative because it works, but historically people vote for a positive message/candidate

ChrisCuomo	689803122080944128	2016-01-20T13:34:14	thats the job. and thank you for mentioning what matters. 
ChrisCuomo	689801555533565952	2016-01-20T13:28:01	if so why isnt Bush getting more traction? 
ChrisCuomo	689796022525128705	2016-01-20T13:06:02	FlintWaterCrisis not only Michigan crisis. Detroit teachers striking basically, closing schools because of conditions.
ChrisCuomo	689794533249384448	2016-01-20T13:00:07	any thought to talking more about what is good about gop candidates, rather than just bashing them and Dems? 
ChrisCuomo	689794009875791872	2016-01-20T12:58:02	i dont see epa tests being reported. if feds knew they could have acted on own, yes. 
ChrisCuomo	689793850064396288	2016-01-20T12:57:24	would you accept that if it were your house? i bet commercial projects going on. 
ChrisCuomo	689793535856545792	2016-01-20T12:56:09	ignore the yap, focus on the actions. you should hear about a plan beyond bottled water for FlintWaterCrisis 
ChrisCuomo	689470119844544512	2016-01-19T15:31:00	Why I turned down an interview with ‘El Chapo’ Guzmán.  Univision said no, Sean Penn said yes to editorial control.
ChrisCuomo	689793140878917632	2016-01-20T12:54:35	10/13/14 - GM refused to use water because it WAS RUSTING PARTS. they got switched. people still told safe to drink 
ChrisCuomo	689792160279957504	2016-01-20T12:50:41	true, but hope President make a quick turn and helps a plan takle shape. czar is a step but need more fast 
ChrisCuomo	689791973755076608	2016-01-20T12:49:56	the is was about state findings primarily. people just seemed to avoid the urgency? 
ChrisCuomo	689791660474155008	2016-01-20T12:48:42	auto resurgence is good news but the urgency is that gm got better water than Flint kids - as you know 
ChrisCuomo	689791384732221440	2016-01-20T12:47:36	state focus but feds must help. immediate action needed not "sorry". whats the plan? bottled water a bandaid Flint 
ChrisCuomo	689790587151740929	2016-01-20T12:44:26	there is no one person in FlintWaterCrisis need all hands on deck...accountability drives action 
ChrisCuomo	689790364346089472	2016-01-20T12:43:33	experts say the water ruined the pipes. now seeing if chemicals can restore but few trust that.

ChrisCuomo	687766290228998144	2016-01-14T22:40:36	Agreed. Both non issues. Idea that Iran tried to embarrass us is not new.

ChrisCuomo	687640944125079552	2016-01-14T14:22:31	Opinion is not same as legal precedent. See hughhewitt for more - a conservative by trade FYI 
ChrisCuomo	687640683730055168	2016-01-14T14:21:29	Agreed. Why are you telling me this, though? 
ChrisCuomo	687640222977372164	2016-01-14T14:19:39	Absolutely nothing 
ChrisCuomo	687640118463705088	2016-01-14T14:19:14	Seems to be code for something negative. That said, for all the experience/travel, I am where I come from :).

ChrisCuomo	687638877096546306	2016-01-14T14:14:18	Great q. Pentagon said unknown  
ChrisCuomo	687638596078145536	2016-01-14T14:13:11	RT'd and plenty of proof to acknowledge the same. My point was this issue among those critics targeting  
ChrisCuomo	687638354075201536	2016-01-14T14:12:13	Agreed 
ChrisCuomo	687638245144936448	2016-01-14T14:11:48	Pentagon says don't have them. Open quez: how and why? Comms? Illegal treatment? Response?

ChrisCuomo	687634498259955713	2016-01-14T13:56:54	true but were both disabled then? 
ChrisCuomo	687633500531470336	2016-01-14T13:52:56	perhaps...need to know. we had first word from pentagon and they say still dont know circs.  
ChrisCuomo	687632629160656897	2016-01-14T13:49:29	agree that would be a mistake especially when we dont know the circs and influences at play. thats why NewDay wont 
ChrisCuomo	687629726790324224	2016-01-14T13:37:57	i am providing analysis...u r drawing conclusions :) 
ChrisCuomo	687629186098442240	2016-01-14T13:35:48	police a different dynamic...this is about how iran acted while "helping" 
ChrisCuomo	687628918745100288	2016-01-14T13:34:44	if they had mechanical trouble that changes analysis, doesnt it? 
ChrisCuomo	687628645775622144	2016-01-14T13:33:39	that too seems something US would know and quickly, no? 
ChrisCuomo	687628271912153089	2016-01-14T13:32:10	fair point from secy kerry that this outcome was better than may have been a few years ago? 
ChrisCuomo	687627778699689984	2016-01-14T13:30:12	that's more odd to me. iran not a friendly. makes sense that they take advantage. why did they have the chance? 
ChrisCuomo	687625446213742592	2016-01-14T13:20:56	political implications re his narrative but dont seem to be legal ones absent FEC action.  
ChrisCuomo	687622687653539841	2016-01-14T13:09:58	as hughhewitt said finding divergent opinions is not the same as a precedent for a position. 
ChrisCuomo	687622351610052612	2016-01-14T13:08:38	thanks for the perspective, congressman. how do you account for criticism of cruz for inconsitency on subsidies? 
ChrisCuomo	687617914992726018	2016-01-14T12:51:00	for iran: projection of strength vs wildly unpopular us. US: how not know boat status? why still figuring it out? 
ChrisCuomo	687616445623209984	2016-01-14T12:45:10	iran being bad guy may be obvious, but wrong focus...how did US not know location/condition of crafts? no comms? 
ChrisCuomo	687613392631238656	2016-01-14T12:33:02	whoa -  the video is what it is - and it aint good. it could be worse, true.  
ChrisCuomo	687613108924362752	2016-01-14T12:31:55	when you put a guy on his knees with hands over heads it is a projection of control...shaming 
ChrisCuomo	687612946311200769	2016-01-14T12:31:16	interesting that pentagon still doesnt know how the boats strayed into iranian water? 
ChrisCuomo	687612718090743808	2016-01-14T12:30:21	.hughhewitt strong on cruz eligibility.1 point, hewitt said it's a political "controversy" not a constitutional one worthy of SCOTUS review
ChrisCuomo	687605282885791744	2016-01-14T12:00:49	me too. hear it all the time. we are at a flashpoint - unknown is how we get better not just angrier from here 
ChrisCuomo	687604909244583936	2016-01-14T11:59:20	"some say"

ChrisCuomo	687257685788499968	2016-01-13T12:59:35	ChrisCuomo Re: His tweet abt Iran: Pure republican politics. Jump at any chance to condemn Obama's efforts or accomplishments. Petty!
ChrisCuomo	687262819499261952	2016-01-13T13:19:59	This comparison seems legitimate. Thoughts? 
ChrisCuomo	687260646078021632	2016-01-13T13:11:21	ChrisCuomo Pelosi &amp; Obama are out of touch. With reality.  Way to hold her feet tithe fire. Great interview. realDonaldTrump will win
ChrisCuomo	687260802018111488	2016-01-13T13:11:58	ChrisCuomo what would Pentagon have done to Iranian military found in US waters? Trust them? Both sides have reasonable and unreasonable.
ChrisCuomo	687262378363367425	2016-01-13T13:18:14	Officials say boats strayed. Pelosi says nothing taken. Release quick and historically that is unusual. What else? 
ChrisCuomo	687262110796087296	2016-01-13T13:17:10	My man, a case is only strong compared to its counter argument. That's the job - to test 
ChrisCuomo	687261383994556417	2016-01-13T13:14:17	I kinda loved ChrisCuomo interview with Rep. Pelosi. Nicely done!
ChrisCuomo	687256387026464768	2016-01-13T12:54:25	ChrisCuomo tpabooks Chris I was sadden that he didn't take responsibility for the tweet and just say I jumped the gun,instead blamed Obama
ChrisCuomo	687257807729627136	2016-01-13T13:00:04	So hearing that sailors went into Iran waters means nothing to you?  Should US have bombed? What is your point? 
ChrisCuomo	687257614103756800	2016-01-13T12:59:18	How reconcile that with what happ'd here? Was Prez making sailors an act of Iran aggression? 
ChrisCuomo	687256500562169856	2016-01-13T12:54:52	dens1984 ChrisCuomo There was widespread outrage in GOP that potus did not address situ in SOTU, instead he made sure they were released.
ChrisCuomo	687257234397642752	2016-01-13T12:57:47	Is that the analogy? So you think Iran was wrong and did something wrong because of disrespect of Prez?

ChrisCuomo	687256419742121984	2016-01-13T12:54:33	I disagree with conclusion. The point is to make things better. Have plans and leadership. May best message win.  
ChrisCuomo	687252922112032768	2016-01-13T12:40:39	ChrisCuomo exactly! A nation will be cautious towards intruders. I would expect the U.S to do the same thing.

ChrisCuomo	687255532206469120	2016-01-13T12:51:02	Not what officials and military say. Seems sailors may have made navigation or other error and were released 
ChrisCuomo	687255231915233280	2016-01-13T12:49:50	Not ez for Gov to deal with polls Thoughts on his justification for tweet condemning Prez abt Iran sailor situation

ChrisCuomo	686893030033518592	2016-01-12T12:50:34	both sides say that...neither side seems to act on it...part of the problem? 
ChrisCuomo	686892698083700736	2016-01-12T12:49:15	so you think there is 0% shared responsibility for impasse in dc? 
ChrisCuomo	686892405937827844	2016-01-12T12:48:06	what is % of employer/outside forces vs personal actions for why people are stuck? 
ChrisCuomo	686891973299597313	2016-01-12T12:46:22	100%. lighter note, MichaelaCNN and i all abt "what ifs" re powerball. if you got 1mm think life better than 100mm? 
ChrisCuomo	686890343921512456	2016-01-12T12:39:54	this is what we were joking about and it got us to dreaming about what it could mean for so many MichaelaCNN 
ChrisCuomo	686890137758863360	2016-01-12T12:39:05	ever broken up a fight by going at only one side? says yes and you are lying 
ChrisCuomo	686889947341688832	2016-01-12T12:38:19	i'm biased - i want good news...imagine if everyone won and it changed $ reality? wonder what would happen then? 
ChrisCuomo	686889519585607681	2016-01-12T12:36:37	u can go "trite but true" but that ignores that any major initiative requires compromise and we have little 
ChrisCuomo	686889301557272576	2016-01-12T12:35:45	HOW we disagree in this moment, sucks. in politics, society. Hostility, violence in language and actions r epidemic 
ChrisCuomo	686888956047290368	2016-01-12T12:34:23	thats his job. it is confused with bias, but i dont care: the job is to test one side with the case of the other. 
ChrisCuomo	686885866380333056	2016-01-12T12:22:06	i know...it was a joke. MichaelaCNN is right...ONCE again! 
ChrisCuomo	686884805011730432	2016-01-12T12:17:53	a remarkable run - but also have to ask what left did to exacerbate including white house? 
ChrisCuomo	686884337493667840	2016-01-12T12:16:02	interesting little from you on the right and left about what you are for...it is all about conflict, what you "hate" 
ChrisCuomo	686884076855373824	2016-01-12T12:15:00	opposition politics is used by both parties. question is on what and how much? tit for tat useless 
ChrisCuomo	686882752151564289	2016-01-12T12:09:44	and this from a hegelian! labels matter in politics, especially when you call yourself something 
ChrisCuomo	686881139466874880	2016-01-12T12:03:19	Turkey explosion left 10 dead so far and many more injured. really packed area in capitol. been there -  tourist hub. NewDay 4 latest
ChrisCuomo	686879705480441856	2016-01-12T11:57:38	bush/gore was a case. you need a case and all the cert standards satisfied. like standing JeffreyToobin - weigh in 
ChrisCuomo	686879365196574721	2016-01-12T11:56:16	no question gop used tactic of opposition to an extreme but no proof i have seen about trying to collapse econ 
ChrisCuomo	686878997276397568	2016-01-12T11:54:49	thanks - the documentary team at CNN is amazing CNNLongform  doing one now on terror in france - what 2015 teaches 
ChrisCuomo	686878577141350400	2016-01-12T11:53:09	and lefty knock on SenSanders being pro gun really about his position on gun manufacturer liability, not control 
ChrisCuomo	686878215911124992	2016-01-12T11:51:42	fwiw - having delved deeply with SenSanders and his team..."democratic socialist" to him seems to mean "liberal" 
ChrisCuomo	686877945554669568	2016-01-12T11:50:38	last word: thats not how SCOTUS works. move on 
ChrisCuomo	686877829569605633	2016-01-12T11:50:10	read it more than once over the years...question is whether/how much biz tactics translate? 
ChrisCuomo	686877566720978944	2016-01-12T11:49:08	must match method to the mood. country galvanized by war/widespread hardship then. now balkanize...tone is me not we 
ChrisCuomo	686876835909636096	2016-01-12T11:46:13	state court diff than SCOTUS - as u should know - as per case/controversy and reluctance to be advisory 
ChrisCuomo	686876446783049729	2016-01-12T11:44:41	question is degree, right? equitable progress which is a function of societal tolerance  
ChrisCuomo	686873426905141248	2016-01-12T11:32:41	better question may be is it fixable period. look at our history, labor always had this complaint to diff degrees  
ChrisCuomo	686873124890099713	2016-01-12T11:31:29	fair point - though not giving veep benefit of context. still, thin case that trump is more of a uniter than biden.  
ChrisCuomo	686872575293681664	2016-01-12T11:29:18	duh. almost every taped intv is edited. negativity is not a proxy for insight. 
ChrisCuomo	686867922229268481	2016-01-12T11:10:48	Amazing how Bowie’s death – and life – has brought everyone together. 
ChrisCuomo	686867848183083009	2016-01-12T11:10:31	remember the last time SCOTUS issued a ruling on something where there was no case? 
ChrisCuomo	686673239565824003	2016-01-11T22:17:12	Gives it the right bite though. Nietzsche had bite period 
ChrisCuomo	686673048255213568	2016-01-11T22:16:27	Arwa is the REAL DEAL. Whole CNNI crew is totally top notch.  
ChrisCuomo	686672760286875648	2016-01-11T22:15:18	No one is right all the time. But you need to get something right at some point... Come on man! :) 
ChrisCuomo	686671855554588672	2016-01-11T22:11:42	Thanks young gun, but some just want to be heard, and speak without considering much beyond that simple goal 
ChrisCuomo	686671367975112708	2016-01-11T22:09:46	Was mich nicht umbricht, macht mich starker... Sounds better in German for some reason
ChrisCuomo	686667696327528448	2016-01-11T21:55:11	Let someone decide what we put on air? No. Go to a Mexican jungle to intv a narco terrorist on the lam? Yes.   
ChrisCuomo	686667345058754562	2016-01-11T21:53:47	adansnan don't read tone in a tweet :) "life is good" is an aphorism, not a calculation. Aside from extremes, point is to see bigger pic
ChrisCuomo	686666501080924160	2016-01-11T21:50:26	fibonacciman618 I don't get it - you prize a thinker like Fibonacci and then talk nonsense. You disrespect your namesake
ChrisCuomo	686665621027876866	2016-01-11T21:46:56	NewsThristy NewDay CNN kinda weird
ChrisCuomo	686664954787807232	2016-01-11T21:44:17	But she just accepted and alisyn is interviewing her TOMORROW.  
ChrisCuomo	686616894217011204	2016-01-11T18:33:18	Again - that's not how SCOTUS works  
ChrisCuomo	686616577685471232	2016-01-11T18:32:03	adansnan I did. And while you may take what you like from the FB post, your notion of timing was irrelevant to me.

ChrisCuomo	686540381039800321	2016-01-11T13:29:16	i think independents may be a bigger factor then gop attacks on sanders. thoughts? 
ChrisCuomo	686539791765221376	2016-01-11T13:26:56	SenSanders and his mngr relish the chance to make the case and be tested. now you be the judge 
ChrisCuomo	686539500865073153	2016-01-11T13:25:46	it is easy to be a tough guy in a studio. recently we did a russian bad guy in ukraine. we went hard. risky. 
ChrisCuomo	686538619738304512	2016-01-11T13:22:16	in mexico...dont know what grounds would be on current facts but never know. dont see it here

ChrisCuomo	686535400169553920	2016-01-11T13:09:29	no proof of snitching, true. but never good to have bad guys suspicious, thats the point. 
ChrisCuomo	686534525451661312	2016-01-11T13:06:00	because your definition is? and who is a journalist who you do not like? 
ChrisCuomo	686534322342506496	2016-01-11T13:05:12	would certainly be a solid investment. 
ChrisCuomo	686533703460323328	2016-01-11T13:02:44	if i could have planned for the relative safety of team and had no preconditions or editorial compromise...yes.  
ChrisCuomo	686532676866699268	2016-01-11T12:58:39	empty cynicism. to go to scotus you need a case or controversy. who would have standing to bring this case? 
ChrisCuomo	686522214791942144	2016-01-11T12:17:05	but journalists intv bad guys all the time, right?  
ChrisCuomo	686514560543526912	2016-01-11T11:46:40	BigBluetn65 ChrisCuomo NewDay Chris brought up a great story about Bowie that is apropos: "how do you stay young?"... "Be authentic."
