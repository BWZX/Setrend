madeleine	725444933813960704	2016-04-27T22:02:04	The so-called TrumpDoctrine is simply bellicose rhetoric strung together with contradictory statements. Bluster is no strategy, Mr. Trump.
madeleine	725444468925698048	2016-04-27T22:00:14	Trump’s proposals to ban Muslims and deport immigrants would undermine America’s greatest strengths: diversity and tolerance.
madeleine	725443869383483392	2016-04-27T21:57:51	Trump's newest slogan is "America First," recalling the self-defeating isolationism of the 1930s.
madeleine	725442650720092166	2016-04-27T21:53:00	Trump’s views on torture are completely out of sync with recommendations by military leaders and America’s values.
madeleine	725442243063062528	2016-04-27T21:51:23	Trump praises Western values, then questions why we should support democracy in other countries.
madeleine	725441994240172032	2016-04-27T21:50:24	Trump’s understanding of trade policy is simplistic at best, and would have disastrous effects on our economy.
madeleine	725441828716208129	2016-04-27T21:49:44	Trump preaches unpredictability as a policy, then asks us to trust him with the nuclear codes.
madeleine	725441588269334530	2016-04-27T21:48:47	Trump speaks about regaining the trust of our allies, but then threatens to pull out of NATO.
madeleine	725441272245313536	2016-04-27T21:47:32	Trump demonstrates no real understanding of complex international issues and has no serious proposals for how to address them.
madeleine	725441002358624256	2016-04-27T21:46:27	So I thought I'd respond using his favorite method of communication and tackle some of the TrumpDoctrine's biggest flaws head on.
