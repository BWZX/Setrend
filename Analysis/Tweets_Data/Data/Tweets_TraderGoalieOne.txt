TraderGoalieOne	702981987397672964	2016-02-25T22:22:21	If the ES goes bid above 1941 look for a nice run taking it up to Close the Gap at 1970.50 Bids above 1970.50 should take it to 1987-1989.

TraderGoalieOne	702976825660743682	2016-02-25T22:01:50	Esimret It doesn't have to go to 1917. That's because the open was showing the momentum was to the upside. That's the purpose of the setup.

TraderGoalieOne	702860271937830912	2016-02-25T14:18:41	nrockstars AaronKuddes   Iside Gaps occur because of Normal market fluctuation. Outside Gaps are News Drive. Inside Gaps fight the market.

TraderGoalieOne	702644093944537088	2016-02-24T23:59:41	If the ES goes bid above 1933 we should see it move a little higher to the next resistance at 1943.75-1944.25
TraderGoalieOne	702643299346161664	2016-02-24T23:56:31	Long ES if it goes bid above 1933 or if the AM open is above 1916 and goes bid above the open. Minor resistance is 1931.25-1932.

TraderGoalieOne	702263756802412545	2016-02-23T22:48:21	If the ES goes offered below 1913 that could set off the selling need to take it down to Close the Gap at 1892.50  RIDE THAT WAVE!!!
TraderGoalieOne	702262924161716224	2016-02-23T22:45:03	ES equilibrium is 1922.50-1922.75 Short if either open is below 1922.50 and goes offered below the open. Minor support is 1913-1913.75
TraderGoalieOne	702258594918572033	2016-02-23T22:27:51	Are we getting the picture on how important the larger time frames are? The ES went from one point to the next. These moves make our week.
TraderGoalieOne	702209925695590401	2016-02-23T19:14:27	Traderchylaxn commander10   I believe we talked about it going offered below 1918 before moving the stop.

TraderGoalieOne	702189052200689666	2016-02-23T17:51:30	anaitis14  Yes but I am looking for that on large time frames. I use many other setups in conjunction with Supply and Demand.
TraderGoalieOne	702175356804059141	2016-02-23T16:57:05	roleston   Which one do you use? And they are lagging indicators always being late. The charts are footprints of dollars that don't lie.

TraderGoalieOne	702169988447256577	2016-02-23T16:35:45	roleston   Of course you use trendlines they are extremely important.
TraderGoalieOne	702166440405815297	2016-02-23T16:21:39	Gaps like to be Filed when the market corrects. There are two Gaps that are close by below the market.
TraderGoalieOne	702165595358363648	2016-02-23T16:18:18	WhittyPics   Once stopped out why not get back in ?
TraderGoalieOne	702165350780170240	2016-02-23T16:17:19	roleston   It all comes from the Daily, Weekly and Monthly charts.
TraderGoalieOne	702164226559889408	2016-02-23T16:12:51	futuretrader14   Probably 1921ish

TraderGoalieOne	702160359847804928	2016-02-23T15:57:29	Let's prepare for the worst. If the ES goes offered below 1898 look for the next Gap to be Filled at 1892.50
TraderGoalieOne	702159833601064960	2016-02-23T15:55:24	I think 1916 in the ES is right around the corner. If it goes offered below 1916 the next stop is 1898-2000. This will be a good wave.
TraderGoalieOne	702158439846383616	2016-02-23T15:49:52	Gazza39544317   When trading Counter Trend breakouts you usually won't get Pullbacks to your point. Those happen on continuation breakouts.

TraderGoalieOne	702148601766670337	2016-02-23T15:10:46	The target in the ES right now is 1915-1918  . Look for it to go down to Close the Gap at 1916

TraderGoalieOne	702146721535672321	2016-02-23T15:03:18	The ES just doesn't feel like it wants to rally. There's an Overbought Shooting Star on the Daily .D chart saying offers below 1932 is Key.
TraderGoalieOne	702138531376996352	2016-02-23T14:30:45	MUST BE SHORT ES when it goes offered below 1932 using a tight stop. This is a day trade for a correction.
TraderGoalieOne	702135889280036865	2016-02-23T14:20:15	WhittyPics   Because the SPY had a Gap and Run which had to catch up to the overnight session. Those bars usually do look different.

TraderGoalieOne	685657165273550848	2016-01-09T02:59:41	The ES Weekly Gravestone Top and Weekly Gap Down was such an easy play. Now pull up the Weekly chart and look at it to see the move.
TraderGoalieOne	685654083533942784	2016-01-09T02:47:27	keithjb    It went up to some resistance and then was holding, and started to sell off and that's when I reentered.
TraderGoalieOne	685653905196343297	2016-01-09T02:46:44	keithjb   You didn't see the tweet where I said I reentered my short because of a gut feeling and actually got it at a higher price.
TraderGoalieOne	685610562995286016	2016-01-08T23:54:30	lonnie_hoffman   I will be teaching in Kansas City March 14 through the 18th
TraderGoalieOne	685586177693466624	2016-01-08T22:17:36	chrisallgood42   You won't get those moves on five-minute charts.
TraderGoalieOne	685585959157657600	2016-01-08T22:16:44	Traderchylaxn   I feel so good about it that I am short.
TraderGoalieOne	685575091372056576	2016-01-08T21:33:33	What did I say about the Weekly Gap? You have to try to let the bar play out because it ends on Friday. How does it look now?
TraderGoalieOne	685571576457236480	2016-01-08T21:19:35	waynes8310 I'm not intentionally looking for those type of patterns. That actually requires too much thought. I like to keep it very simple
TraderGoalieOne	685571289428422656	2016-01-08T21:18:27	waynes8310   I trade strictly off the charts. That's a normal wave pattern so I imagine I do in some sort of way.
TraderGoalieOne	685570379365126144	2016-01-08T21:14:50	TarHeelTrader   That's really great, good job! Remember what I said in class? Trading is only hard because we make it hard. Keep it simple.
TraderGoalieOne	685516406910234624	2016-01-08T17:40:22	chatwithtraders   Tell me a little about this. What does it entail
TraderGoalieOne	685464607759200256	2016-01-08T14:14:32	I'm bearish but this is a play where we can take advantage of the Short Coverers. Be long above the open with tight stops.
TraderGoalieOne	685464296218845184	2016-01-08T14:13:18	We should experience the same thing with the AM open being oversold and into support. MUST BE LONG above the AM open using a tight stop.
TraderGoalieOne	685463685213597696	2016-01-08T14:10:52	I mentioned the ES should snap back above the open it would be a good short term buy for a pullback. Don't trust the rally, I don't.
TraderGoalieOne	685450918679166976	2016-01-08T13:20:08	lonnie_hoffman   There's no delay, the market really above the number while we were asleep.
TraderGoalieOne	685450704539009024	2016-01-08T13:19:17	sethtrader17   Then it's not a short anymore. If It's above resistance it's probably going higher.
TraderGoalieOne	685330848766410753	2016-01-08T05:23:01	We're seeing a short covering rally in the ES  I don't think it will get past the resistance at 1935.50-1937. That could be a good re short
TraderGoalieOne	685314522287091712	2016-01-08T04:18:09	lonnie_hoffman I will be in Kansas in one or two months. I think it's in February
TraderGoalieOne	685314395589750784	2016-01-08T04:17:39	tinman1839   And he definitely will make it nobody hits harder than he does.
TraderGoalieOne	685304326542221312	2016-01-08T03:37:38	roleston   Yes.
TraderGoalieOne	685281275561820160	2016-01-08T02:06:02	It looks like the snapback above the open in the ES is happening as I said.
TraderGoalieOne	685249011842953216	2016-01-07T23:57:50	ChrisMey2   You are so late to the party, it's real hard to get short down there.
TraderGoalieOne	685238779049672704	2016-01-07T23:17:10	ChrisMey2  I left a lot on the table but I was able to re-short at higher price. I was talking about gut instinct.
TraderGoalieOne	685238530285543424	2016-01-07T23:16:11	ChrisMey2   If you read the tweets I mentioned that I got back in.
TraderGoalieOne	685237980793970688	2016-01-07T23:14:00	AxKrantz ES
TraderGoalieOne	685237732050771968	2016-01-07T23:13:01	ChrisMey2   Been short for days.
TraderGoalieOne	685236117923180544	2016-01-07T23:06:36	I think we just saw an early Pump and Dump. They bid it up in pre market then sold it off right from the open. It is going lower.
TraderGoalieOne	685235476798685185	2016-01-07T23:04:03	For a quick scalp, Long ES when it goes bid above 1936.50. We're looking for a little profit taking.  But use tight stops.
TraderGoalieOne	685233286113697792	2016-01-07T22:55:21	If the ES goes offered below 1928 we should see 1900 right around the corner. Offers below 1900 is going to send this in a free fall.
TraderGoalieOne	685231606789832704	2016-01-07T22:48:40	ES equilibrium is 1943.50-1950.75  Short if either open is below 1943.50 and goes offered below the open. Minor support is 1928-1928.50
TraderGoalieOne	685229454914760705	2016-01-07T22:40:07	ProTraderKim  Nice BD Hook Reversal and a Hammer Bottom with two  nice Oversold indicators saying MUST BE LONG when it's bid above 1.4642
TraderGoalieOne	685198149728776192	2016-01-07T20:35:43	mhopey74 roleston   Only with a tight stop.
TraderGoalieOne	685195343353495553	2016-01-07T20:24:34	roleston   Yes, and you had to of been short below today's AM open.
TraderGoalieOne	685195183386980353	2016-01-07T20:23:56	LT_trader  I'm not showing my style to the world. You never hear me mention any strategies online.

TraderGoalieOne	685180190666977282	2016-01-07T19:24:22	manster_mg clesmo1 Iriemic   Since 1980
TraderGoalieOne	685179827641561089	2016-01-07T19:22:55	commander10   Gaps aren't measured from open to close. They're taken from highs and lows.
TraderGoalieOne	685171161139941376	2016-01-07T18:48:29	_nyc_trades   No website at present. But I am considering putting something together.
TraderGoalieOne	685170774513205249	2016-01-07T18:46:57	Don't go crazy on this but I just don't see any support. We're below many key levels.
TraderGoalieOne	685170460829560832	2016-01-07T18:45:42	It looks to me like there's no place else to go but down for these markets. I'm calling 500 lower in the DOW.  There is no support close by.
TraderGoalieOne	685161026602418177	2016-01-07T18:08:13	tinman1839   All the levels are right in the tweets.
TraderGoalieOne	685160859161628672	2016-01-07T18:07:33	With the ES trying to Fill todays Gap and failing tells me one thing. This is weak. This is going to be one fun ride!~

TraderGoalieOne	685140823672025089	2016-01-07T16:47:56	NG MUST BE LONG above 2.386 using tight stops. Stay long above that number.
TraderGoalieOne	685140290265571329	2016-01-07T16:45:49	It looks like the NG is going through the 2.386 level. Time to get long.
TraderGoalieOne	685139790191325184	2016-01-07T16:43:49	Traderchylaxn   Absolutely, I'm working that order right now
TraderGoalieOne	685138779670212608	2016-01-07T16:39:48	vmmaniac ogdenfinan  When you are playing for big dollars sometimes big dollars are left on the table. It's all relative.
TraderGoalieOne	685138477663547392	2016-01-07T16:38:36	vmmaniac ogdenfinan   The more $ I make the wider my stops get to avoid getting knocked out. Therefore my swings tend to be a little wider
TraderGoalieOne	685138133864824833	2016-01-07T16:37:15	vmmaniac ogdenfinan because when I'm riding a wave I'm looking to ride a wave. The more I make the wider my stops get. I'm not daytrading.
TraderGoalieOne	685126253486194688	2016-01-07T15:50:02	vmmaniac ogdenfinan  i'm waiting to sell a few more.
TraderGoalieOne	685126160100003841	2016-01-07T15:49:40	vmmaniac ogdenfinan  I don't get out at targets, I tighten up my stop. Why say that's all the money I want to make, it doesn't make sense.
TraderGoalieOne	685125845711777792	2016-01-07T15:48:25	clesmo1 Iriemic   Nobody except amateurs look for gaps on intraday charts.
TraderGoalieOne	685125729932173312	2016-01-07T15:47:57	clesmo1 Iriemic   That's because they're not there. You're on the wrong charts. You'll find them on the daily weekly and monthly.
TraderGoalieOne	685125449500983296	2016-01-07T15:46:50	keithjb harveyrosenblum   It's all done on a daily chart. With a precise point to get in at you now have a precise point to get out at.
TraderGoalieOne	685124861551865856	2016-01-07T15:44:30	mhopey74 Iriemic   I was already short, I was adding to my position at that point.
TraderGoalieOne	685107519442702336	2016-01-07T14:35:35	mhopey74    Yes, using a tight stop.
TraderGoalieOne	685107383828283392	2016-01-07T14:35:03	Iriemic   Yes, but it's such a huge gap and you should've been in last night. But the trading day starts at 6 o'clock pm eastern time
TraderGoalieOne	685106806943698945	2016-01-07T14:32:46	Gap lower opens in the ES, NQ and YM
TraderGoalieOne	685106415615082496	2016-01-07T14:31:12	Yep lower opens in the ES, YM and NQ
TraderGoalieOne	685105257085403136	2016-01-07T14:26:36	mhopey74   Taking the trade in the direction of the gap.

TraderGoalieOne	685102681610936320	2016-01-07T14:16:22	harveyrosenblum   Have you taken a class with OTA, if so with who?
TraderGoalieOne	685102459845488640	2016-01-07T14:15:29	keithjb harveyrosenblum   You are trading price not time, so it shouldn't matter whether you want to daily or a five-minute.
TraderGoalieOne	685094066145652736	2016-01-07T13:42:08	keithjb harveyrosenblum   Daily weekly or monthly.
TraderGoalieOne	685093231143555072	2016-01-07T13:38:49	TarHeelTrader   Let the school know if your success maybe they'll have me out there more.
TraderGoalieOne	685092457680375808	2016-01-07T13:35:44	harveyrosenblum   That's what I always say in class. Daily weekly and monthly Thats all you need.
TraderGoalieOne	685092229694763008	2016-01-07T13:34:50	ogdenfinan I don't know what you're looking at, where are those numbers from? The Gap is 1936-1947.50
TraderGoalieOne	685090568637149185	2016-01-07T13:28:14	To those of you who think the market opens at 9:30am et think again, you are 15 hours late. You missed the move now you just pick up scraps.
TraderGoalieOne	685089056385044481	2016-01-07T13:22:14	ogdenfinan  it's right there on the weekly chart. I mentioned it to lines in my tweet
TraderGoalieOne	685087917702787072	2016-01-07T13:17:42	TarHeelTrader   We got some very serious cash going Brian.
TraderGoalieOne	685060959690342400	2016-01-07T11:30:35	ES went right down to my target. Filled the Gap then bounced. If it goes below the Gap once more, it could be setting up for an $80 drop.
TraderGoalieOne	685059476660056064	2016-01-07T11:24:41	sethtrader17  I meant it's bearish to me
TraderGoalieOne	685058739418886144	2016-01-07T11:21:45	@HoangJD They are on intraday charts. I wouldn't worry about them. what are the time frames that you keep on your screen?
TraderGoalieOne	684974228047806465	2016-01-07T05:45:56	pedrojrgarcia79   That's the name of the game. The government certainly isn't doing a good job of that.
TraderGoalieOne	684974086607499264	2016-01-07T05:45:23	pedrojrgarcia79  I'd rather not say but it's definitely up there.
TraderGoalieOne	684967629140799489	2016-01-07T05:19:43	pedrojrgarcia79   Well I'll tell you I'm very loaded up feeling that it's the big one.
TraderGoalieOne	684935405511163904	2016-01-07T03:11:40	TarHeelTrader   Tighten my stop a bit then see if it takes out that level.
TraderGoalieOne	684934660351102976	2016-01-07T03:08:43	Gaps like to be filled during corrections. There's a Weekly Gap down at 1936-1947.50  That's my next target.
TraderGoalieOne	684933906915700736	2016-01-07T03:05:43	vipfatcat   For sure!
TraderGoalieOne	684933796076978177	2016-01-07T03:05:17	sethtrader17   It has a Weekly Gap higher that's still unfilled. That's bullish to me.
TraderGoalieOne	684933177375199236	2016-01-07T03:02:49	Look at the Daily, Weekly and Monthly ES charts side by side and tell me. Where does it look like it's going? My money says down.
TraderGoalieOne	684929423418605569	2016-01-07T02:47:54	Affordable Healthcare is not affordable. The stock market at record highs based on Hope &amp; Change and WW3 brewing.The markets falling apart.
TraderGoalieOne	684926100011499520	2016-01-07T02:34:42	Clown__Prince   The markets really open at 6:00 pm et
TraderGoalieOne	684924864482770949	2016-01-07T02:29:47	Clown__Prince Then you should have got back in again below 1987.25
TraderGoalieOne	684923141823463425	2016-01-07T02:22:56	TraderGoalieOne I use 10 tics to start out with. Small losses and you can always get back in when it gives you the signal again.
TraderGoalieOne	684921271184830464	2016-01-07T02:15:30	The markets going to do what it's going to do whether you're in front of the screen or not. Why drive yourself crazy!
TraderGoalieOne	684920522958753792	2016-01-07T02:12:32	Here's the importance of having stops in place and walking away from the screen. I just came back to a nice surprise.
TraderGoalieOne	684911976594673664	2016-01-07T01:38:34	lou321g SusanCTShore  I'm in New York when ever the school requests me to be there. Try calling the Manhattan or the Long Island location.
TraderGoalieOne	684907770219331584	2016-01-07T01:21:52	lonnie_hoffman   They are setups that I teach in my classes. You've must of read something from one of my students.

TraderGoalieOne	684894517485506561	2016-01-07T00:29:12	bgbeisse    It looks real good to me.
TraderGoalieOne	684875658057674752	2016-01-06T23:14:15	TarHeelTrader    I think it's definitely worth a shot. Use a tight stop. It looks like it could go up to the high from the 27th
TraderGoalieOne	684875268817874944	2016-01-06T23:12:43	ScronceTim it's when we have an open higher than the previous days high or lower than the previous days low. The high to the low is the gap
TraderGoalieOne	684875005939855361	2016-01-06T23:11:40	ProTraderKim    It sure does but it has to travel a long way to get there. That's a lot of edge to give up. It's still should work.
TraderGoalieOne	684874182660730881	2016-01-06T23:08:24	Minor support in the ES comes in at 1970-1970.50  I think offers below 1970 should cause the bottom to drop out. But that's just me.
TraderGoalieOne	684873379774517249	2016-01-06T23:05:12	Actually you can get short ES with offers below 1987.75  using tight stops. IOt should run from there.
TraderGoalieOne	684871878561804289	2016-01-06T22:59:14	Here's where it's going to get fun. Short ES when it goes offered below 1984 or if the AM open is below 1984 &amp; goes offered below the open.
TraderGoalieOne	684871097641123840	2016-01-06T22:56:08	ChrisMey2   I think there will be plenty of stormy waters ahead.
TraderGoalieOne	684870593666269185	2016-01-06T22:54:08	ScronceTim  Looking at the day session chart only it's the low of the previous day to where it opens and now it becomes the highs of today
TraderGoalieOne	684870125590204416	2016-01-06T22:52:16	ES has some minor resistance coming in at 1995-1996.50  Bids above 1996.50 should get it moving towards the beginning of the Gap at 2014.25
TraderGoalieOne	684869664489385984	2016-01-06T22:50:26	ES equilibrium is 1984-1990 I don't see much upside but long if it goes bid above or if the AM open is above 1990 &amp; goes bid above the open

TraderGoalieOne	684814626136174592	2016-01-06T19:11:44	harveyrosenblum   Well maybe you.
TraderGoalieOne	684798521313083392	2016-01-06T18:07:45	I'll bet nobody knew this. The Weekly charts on ES, NQ and YM have Unfilled Gaps with Gravestone Tops. That's pretty bearish.

TraderGoalieOne	684785981740855296	2016-01-06T17:17:55	SusanCTShore   That monster Gap was filled today. You do not look for Gaps on intra day charts.
TraderGoalieOne	684785679985815552	2016-01-06T17:16:43	SusanCTShore  Susan, you need to take advantage of the free retakes and take one of MY classes. It will be a whole new experience.
TraderGoalieOne	684785274048479233	2016-01-06T17:15:06	SusanCTShore  You're looking at Gaps on a 5 minute chart.  Do you expect to make money trading on 5 min charts? On the daily it's not a Gap
TraderGoalieOne	684784718185795584	2016-01-06T17:12:54	roleston   You NEVER use opens and closes to draw trend lines. They are always taken from highs and lows.
TraderGoalieOne	684783263676641280	2016-01-06T17:07:07	SusanCTShore   How could they have a different Gap than everyone else?
TraderGoalieOne	684782052420399104	2016-01-06T17:02:18	SusanCTShore  Not sure what that is. There can't be a different Gap.
TraderGoalieOne	684777883278036992	2016-01-06T16:45:44	Al morning Gaps were filled except for the YM, it missed by 18 tics.After Gaps get Filled they usually reverse. This seems to be the case.
TraderGoalieOne	684777077422202882	2016-01-06T16:42:32	@HoangJD   Because there were two decisions to make. To play the Gap and Run or to Fad the Oversold open.
TraderGoalieOne	684744466901516289	2016-01-06T14:32:57	Tough trade here if you don't have a position on. You must be long above the open for a reversal or short below the open. Use tight stops.
TraderGoalieOne	684743703315873792	2016-01-06T14:29:55	edwardsingrid11   This one is tough because it's outside the BB Bands. I feel it's going lower though.
TraderGoalieOne	684743455512215552	2016-01-06T14:28:56	Clown__Prince sethtrader17   It's definitely not helping. The world is laughing at us. Unbelievable how everybody perceives us now.
TraderGoalieOne	684743193884102656	2016-01-06T14:27:53	Look for Gap Opens in the ES, YM and NQ this morning. Gaps across the board.
TraderGoalieOne	684735586540859392	2016-01-06T13:57:40	sethtrader17  It's a tough play here I believe it's going lower so you need to be short below the open. But it is way oversold. Tight stops
TraderGoalieOne	684735207921070080	2016-01-06T13:56:09	Incometrade0938   The tweets are my targets
TraderGoalieOne	684735128971669504	2016-01-06T13:55:51	Iriemic   You got to play it initially using a tight stop. It's probably going lower.
TraderGoalieOne	684731433231986689	2016-01-06T13:41:10	Look at the weekly charts it was all there. The S&amp;P's taking out a nice little trend line. Those on small time frames would never see it.
TraderGoalieOne	684730582350299136	2016-01-06T13:37:47	You don't have to listen to the news to find out why all these markets are falling apart. All you have to do is look at the charts.

TraderGoalieOne	684721988246491136	2016-01-06T13:03:38	I mentioned this the other day that 1982-1983 was a solid level. MUST ADD ON BELOW. I don't see much support until the Gap fill at 1937.25
TraderGoalieOne	684720545816915968	2016-01-06T12:57:54	Short ES when it's offered below 2007 and look for it to move to support at 1992-1993. Below 1992, LOOK OUT BELOW!
TraderGoalieOne	684597044665659392	2016-01-06T04:47:09	CaesarOTA   I'll be in Charlotte next week and in 3 weeks I'll be in Baltimore.
TraderGoalieOne	684596041530781700	2016-01-06T04:43:10	CaesarOTA  I would love to come there. The school needs to request me. Call the school, have them get me back out there.
TraderGoalieOne	684595505284820992	2016-01-06T04:41:02	Skinsgame19   Buying? Nope, I'm selling.
TraderGoalieOne	684595189751480320	2016-01-06T04:39:47	vmmaniac vmmaniac   More sellers than buyers?  My guess is that nice big Unfilled Gap above was just too strong of resistance.
TraderGoalieOne	684594408818249729	2016-01-06T04:36:40	CaesarOTA   Not that kind of ranch. I want a one level house.
TraderGoalieOne	684570339230154752	2016-01-06T03:01:02	The ES couldn't make new highs from yesterday on the Globex charts, it's trading below yesterdays low. It's feeling a little heavy.
TraderGoalieOne	684569225260748800	2016-01-06T02:56:36	I believe yesterday was the eye of the storm. I'm putting my money where my mouth is.
TraderGoalieOne	684568627274592256	2016-01-06T02:54:14	Traderchylaxn   You're supposed to have the position on and then go to dinner. Then you're not forced to move stops, you'd still be short.
TraderGoalieOne	684567363165896704	2016-01-06T02:49:12	tinman1839   No, because that entire Gap is Resistance.
TraderGoalieOne	684513745935073282	2016-01-05T23:16:09	Bids in the ES above 2017 should push it up Closing the Gap at 2030.25  Above 3030.25 we can see it drift higher but with resistance.
TraderGoalieOne	684512173305925632	2016-01-05T23:09:54	Long ES if it goes bid above 2010.75 or if the AM open is above 2007 and goes bid above the open. Minor resistance comes in at 2014.25-2017

TraderGoalieOne	684478189511417856	2016-01-05T20:54:52	Wow! I might be moving. Someone came to my house today and wants to buy my house. I really wasn't planning on moving but I do want a ranch.
TraderGoalieOne	684471060402696193	2016-01-05T20:26:32	RagzTO   Yes I do use multiple time frames. Daily, Weekly and Monthly.
TraderGoalieOne	684470618591465472	2016-01-05T20:24:46	edwardsingrid11   Gut feeling. I just don't trust these markets. That big gap lower. It all smells of weakness. And I was heavily short.
TraderGoalieOne	684425143100268545	2016-01-05T17:24:04	commander10 sethtrader17   No, I enter it right from the opening. I don't waste time.  I may use the range for my stops.
TraderGoalieOne	684400675078422528	2016-01-05T15:46:51	sethtrader17   Opening range orders had to be filled in the first minute. Most the time they were done in much less. There is your range.
TraderGoalieOne	684396080696553473	2016-01-05T15:28:35	sethtrader17  On the trading floor it was the first minute but computers are much faster so I give it 30 seconds.
TraderGoalieOne	684395127222235136	2016-01-05T15:24:48	TarHeelTrader   I would add on below 1999 but I already have a large number on. I need a little more of a cushion before I can add on.
TraderGoalieOne	684394342048493569	2016-01-05T15:21:41	sethtrader17   I played the opening range on the day session charts. At least I got back in higher than from where I got out.
TraderGoalieOne	684393803747295232	2016-01-05T15:19:32	TarHeelTrader   Those are my feelings too. I'm looking to Close that Lower Gap
TraderGoalieOne	684392966513913856	2016-01-05T15:16:13	I had to get bac in the ES  That Gap Lower was just too strong.
TraderGoalieOne	684371637106536448	2016-01-05T13:51:27	linpeter11861 YraHarris   Go back and look at his previous letters and you will find that he is pretty spot on.

TraderGoalieOne	684208430790373378	2016-01-05T03:02:56	jklein0605   Yes. We should have a good idea by Friday.
TraderGoalieOne	684179220248002560	2016-01-05T01:06:52	If the ES goes bid above 2012 look for it take a run up to 2030-2031  Now anything above 2009.50 will leave a Daily Gap Up at 9:30am et
TraderGoalieOne	684176932146180097	2016-01-05T00:57:46	Traderchylaxn  You're thinking correctly. I'd rather get stopped out than put a limit on how much profit I make on the trade going my way.
TraderGoalieOne	684176002499645444	2016-01-05T00:54:05	elpriminho   The school needs to request me to be there. I'm sure they would if people asked.
TraderGoalieOne	684143436103086080	2016-01-04T22:44:40	Long ES if it goes bid above 2011 or if the AM open is above 2011 and goes bid above the open. Look for some resistance at 2009.50-2012.
TraderGoalieOne	684142885558710273	2016-01-04T22:42:29	Look for a little bounce in the ES possibly at 1974-1975 but with offers below 1974 we should see it sell off big.
TraderGoalieOne	684142606549430273	2016-01-04T22:41:22	If the ES is offered below 1999.50 we are looking for it to move down to support at 1982-1983.25  Offers below 1982, LOOK OUT BELOW!
TraderGoalieOne	684141602042961922	2016-01-04T22:37:23	ES equilibrium is 1999.50-2011 Short if it goes offered below 1999.50 or if either open is below 1999.50 and goes offered below the open.
TraderGoalieOne	684140505421234176	2016-01-04T22:33:01	edwardsingrid11   You were so right.  8-)
TraderGoalieOne	684140096287830020	2016-01-04T22:31:24	TarHeelTrader   I won't be getting in until Sunday night. Monday would probably be better. This way I'm already relaxed.
TraderGoalieOne	684132363660562432	2016-01-04T22:00:40	Wow! Nice rockem sockem day. Left a little chunk on the table when I stopped out but it was still a real good way to start off the year.
TraderGoalieOne	684130876666580993	2016-01-04T21:54:46	TarHeelTrader edwardsingrid11   We made good money and that's what counts. When the big wave comes, we'll be ready.
TraderGoalieOne	684130595904045056	2016-01-04T21:53:39	lou321g Clown__Prince   Why would you go long on the open? That was like stepping in front of a train. Fading the Gap, not good.
TraderGoalieOne	684130023511605248	2016-01-04T21:51:22	edwardsingrid11 TarHeelTrader   I got stopped out when it went above 2001. I left a chunk on the table but I walked away with a  bunch.
TraderGoalieOne	684083407555543040	2016-01-04T18:46:08	TarHeelTrader  If it stays down at these levels I think we'll see another wave of sellers coming in towards the end of the day.
TraderGoalieOne	684081309979918336	2016-01-04T18:37:48	TarHeelTrader   Good call using the opening range to stop out at.
TraderGoalieOne	684080342718873600	2016-01-04T18:33:57	TarHeelTrader   Wow! I didn't get stopped out. It just missed me. Had my stop at 2001.
TraderGoalieOne	684077606132690944	2016-01-04T18:23:05	TarHeelTrader  at that point I was looking at how many dollars I was trying to protect. I had a very large position.
TraderGoalieOne	684076239502589952	2016-01-04T18:17:39	TarHeelTrader   I'm not in front of my screen. I have stops in and probably have been stopped out.
TraderGoalieOne	684075855367266304	2016-01-04T18:16:08	So much for the market being down 600. It had the momentum and it was below key levels then just kind of died.
TraderGoalieOne	684051005948989440	2016-01-04T16:37:23	@InfanteWealth  I look at both sessions. Globex is rare. Usually when you see it on Globex it's over the weekend.

TraderGoalieOne	684047191112085509	2016-01-04T16:22:14	TarHeelTrader   1983 was my next point
TraderGoalieOne	684042307386109953	2016-01-04T16:02:49	500 lower in the DOW here we come. I'm calling for 600 lower though.
TraderGoalieOne	684041933375848448	2016-01-04T16:01:20	@InfanteWealth   That's because you're looking at a Globex chart, try looking at the Day Session only.

TraderGoalieOne	684021491206373376	2016-01-04T14:40:06	TarHeelTrader   The only problem is for those starting their day in the morning, youpretty much missed the whole move.
TraderGoalieOne	684021075190132736	2016-01-04T14:38:27	5 minute chart traders, how's the day going for you? You must have made $250 today (maybe). Do you see the importance of THE BIG PICTURE?
TraderGoalieOne	684020227693232128	2016-01-04T14:35:05	TarHeelTrader  I'm looking at 1982-1983 as my next target. Below that I think it's all over.

TraderGoalieOne	684018420808085504	2016-01-04T14:27:54	The ES took out our target at 2000. Now with offers below 2000 we should see continued selling taking it to the next point at 1990-1991.
TraderGoalieOne	684016119343116288	2016-01-04T14:18:45	Incometrade0938    I'll tighten stops a bit and try to ride the wave. Why get out of something that's going your way very nicely.
TraderGoalieOne	684015878132920321	2016-01-04T14:17:48	TarHeelTrader   I sure do! It's a wonderful plan yet very few do it. I hope my class paid off.
