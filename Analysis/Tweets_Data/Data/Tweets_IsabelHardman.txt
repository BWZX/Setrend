IsabelHardman	707621980061769728	2016-03-09T17:40:01	philipjcowley yes - it's more that I don't like religious people suggesting that they have more problematic views than any other people

IsabelHardman	707553249964990464	2016-03-09T13:06:55	jessjackdad not sure where I suggested it was. If Corbyn wants to serve real people he should focus on one issue and dissect it.

IsabelHardman	702466071652073473	2016-02-24T12:12:17	Woah. Cameron tells Corbyn his mother would tell the labour leader to put on a proper suit, do up his tie and sing the national anthem.

IsabelHardman	701793243030286336	2016-02-22T15:38:42	Labour heckling Cameron quite a bit during this statement: a sort of low-level rumble from the backbenches opposite him.

IsabelHardman	684323023458070529	2016-01-05T10:38:17	Mancman10 very true because I am a bias so call jrounalist who only thinks in terms of tribal support, like party hacks do.
IsabelHardman	684322600290508801	2016-01-05T10:36:36	montie haha, not sure my piece does assume that - more that it’s fair enough for ministers to go along with the charade...
IsabelHardman	684320629873635328	2016-01-05T10:28:46	Cameron to give ministers a free vote on EU referendum. Nothing else he could have done, and good to announce it now 
IsabelHardman	684319034146435072	2016-01-05T10:22:26	paul_astell SpecCoffeeHouse well then why not go for a walk or watch a film? You are the one choosing to follow it...

IsabelHardman	684125502286786561	2016-01-04T21:33:24	WarwickHunt4 D_Raval you mean speculation fuelled by Corbyn's team briefing the press? As hard as this might be to accept, they do that.

IsabelHardman	684109235534303232	2016-01-04T20:28:46	D_Raval you haven't put "unfounded conspiracy theories" in your "what to expect" list. I'd like a refund pls.

IsabelHardman	683999092775763968	2016-01-04T13:11:06	MikeSRigby ha. Sadly the PM told me a while ago that my caricature really did look like me. I haven’t yet got my revenge...
IsabelHardman	683998959883423744	2016-01-04T13:10:34	JohnChaytor ha, no I know, it’s more the acceptance about role of the state that could lead to mass housebuilding. I like to be optimistic!
IsabelHardman	683998382134804480	2016-01-04T13:08:17	JamesMildred thanks
IsabelHardman	683998236458221568	2016-01-04T13:07:42	MartynWilliams2 but what is lost by having it on a Tuesday morning, for instance?
IsabelHardman	683996401181831169	2016-01-04T13:00:24	MartynWilliams2 well I’d argue that there are lots of problems, not one ‘the problem'
IsabelHardman	683995897701773312	2016-01-04T12:58:24	JOCWhite ah cheers - it has been quite divisive in Westminster: lots of messages from MPs who v.much disgaree

IsabelHardman	683994955149406211	2016-01-04T12:54:39	joncstone yes - and the idea that it’s not at the behest of the whips is a bit silly too. Not that I think Davies is a villain particularly
IsabelHardman	683994760529461250	2016-01-04T12:53:53	ianbirrell thanks Ian
IsabelHardman	683994710046806016	2016-01-04T12:53:41	hvklav thanks v.much: I don’t mind complexity etc, but not a system that gives v.small number of MPs power, often on behalf of whips

IsabelHardman	683943433564733441	2016-01-04T09:29:56	WestminsterDUP PhilipDaviesMP ah just seen these tweets. Yes that makes sense as does the point about test of support on a Friday.
IsabelHardman	683943210327117824	2016-01-04T09:29:03	WestminsterDUP lots of disagreement with my argument in messages I've been getting about this from MPs. What do you see the virtue being?
IsabelHardman	683936035659710468	2016-01-04T09:00:32	Reform may not mean more bills get passed - many of them are really poor pieces of legislation - but it would encourage scrutiny, not farce.
IsabelHardman	683935657933320192	2016-01-04T08:59:02	Private members' bills are embarrassing Parliament and need to change: my column in today's Times 
IsabelHardman	683934971376087040	2016-01-04T08:56:18	Suspicion in some Labour quarters is that Corbyn doesn't want to go nearly as far in reshuffle as some around him 
IsabelHardman	683915644140662784	2016-01-04T07:39:30	APSchrader well I explain that in the piece. Sorry you don't want to use the paywall, but it's there and my piece is behind it.
IsabelHardman	683790474369462273	2016-01-03T23:22:07	AzzaGhaidouni but being rude does you no service either. And now I’m off to bed.
IsabelHardman	683790413149421572	2016-01-03T23:21:53	AzzaGhaidouni that was your assumption - I never said I was pro-status quo…
IsabelHardman	683788060052557824	2016-01-03T23:12:32	AzzaGhaidouni indeed. Can I suggest you’ll get further in discussions in future if you don’t come across as angry and patronising?
IsabelHardman	683786914395197443	2016-01-03T23:07:59	AzzaGhaidouni however, there is a small group of very active and impressive peers who ensure that the Lords does a good job in revising
IsabelHardman	683786804466728961	2016-01-03T23:07:32	AzzaGhaidouni well as it happens I do support Lords reform. I find it hard to defend the current system there too.
IsabelHardman	683777524388761600	2016-01-03T22:30:40	FreddSays will you be tweeting this every fortnight when I post my column?
IsabelHardman	683775057563369474	2016-01-03T22:20:52	AzzaGhaidouni no, you obviously know loads more about this thing called Parliament than I do...
IsabelHardman	683774689295110146	2016-01-03T22:19:24	Iain_33 love it!
IsabelHardman	683762392229122048	2016-01-03T21:30:32	AzzaGhaidouni I'm quite willing to defend the Commons against accusations that it's pointless and full of idiots.

IsabelHardman	683315972208484352	2016-01-02T15:56:37	mrianleslie though… what people think eggs actually *are* is interesting. A lot of people think they are actually a chick, not just food
IsabelHardman	683315370116120577	2016-01-02T15:54:14	mrianleslie though sadly none of mine are laying currently as they are In The Moult.
IsabelHardman	683315249198559233	2016-01-02T15:53:45	mrianleslie this is excellent. Glad they include debunking of stupid terms like ‘farm fresh’ and misleading ‘cage free’ too.

IsabelHardman	682940242651955201	2016-01-01T15:03:36	mbison22 spectator thanks for that, but you can't call someone's work "nonsense" and not expect a reasonably forceful response...
IsabelHardman	682921964479053824	2016-01-01T13:50:59	mbison22 spectator I'd have dropped that argument about the "purpose of cow's milk" too. Just off to eat an egg and grow feathers.

IsabelHardman	682916898296692736	2016-01-01T13:30:51	mbison22 spectator and he purpose of an egg is? Or of a kale leaf? Or of quinoa?
