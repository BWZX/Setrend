micahspruill	706236378565181441	2016-03-05T21:54:08	_rathihitesh certainly in academics. TA matters most on how good you are at interpreting patterns and important price levels.
micahspruill	706189197460303874	2016-03-05T18:46:39	_rathihitesh in my opinion, FA is really only best on long time scales whereas TA can be used on many different time scales.
