GrantWahl	715020423474384897	2016-03-30T03:38:48	osasuo I hear you. It's the Internet, though, so lots of anger in general!
GrantWahl	715019641387622401	2016-03-30T03:35:41	It wasn't just the US men not being good enough in the 2 Olympic deciders. It was the way they totally lost their composure in both games.
GrantWahl	715018178477367296	2016-03-30T03:29:52	FT USA 1:2 Colombia. US misses 2 straight Olympics in men's soccer for 1st time in 48 years. Real fiasco was October home loss to Honduras.
GrantWahl	715016035313848320	2016-03-30T03:21:21	Honestly, both USA &amp; Colombia have been dirty and unsporting in this game. Two unlikable teams.
GrantWahl	715015664185040899	2016-03-30T03:19:53	Kyndrasports absolutely correct

GrantWahl	715010095034343425	2016-03-30T02:57:45	COLOMBIA goal—emphatic from Martínez. US needs at least 2 more now.
GrantWahl	715009143837474816	2016-03-30T02:53:58	US playing a bit better this half, but very fortunate with the own goal &amp; Parker avoiding red card.
GrantWahl	715008428125630465	2016-03-30T02:51:08	USA GOAL—Own goal by Colombia, and we're all square with an Olympic berth on the line.

GrantWahl	714968403728056322	2016-03-30T00:12:05	HT USA 2:0 GUA. Should be a bigger lead. Help for Klinsmann on the continuity front: Cameron always a starting centerback.
GrantWahl	714965566075838464	2016-03-30T00:00:49	USA GOAL—Cameron with a header finish reminiscent of the CONCACAF Cup. 2-0.
