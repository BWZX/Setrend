JonHeyman	726015640419598337	2016-04-29T11:49:52	in this case, word is dee gordon didn't do full appeal and accepted responsibility thursday. could have kept process going.

JonHeyman	724651565026516993	2016-04-25T17:29:31	was interesting to see matz shut down braves over weekend. he was the braves target in brief adrelton talks with mets.

JonHeyman	724649875724472322	2016-04-25T17:22:48	maeda (3-0, 0.36) a great story. also a story of cooperation. after issues detected, he got $25M guarantee, $81M incentives
JonHeyman	724645943308619776	2016-04-25T17:07:10	leake preferred to stay home in A. he signed in STL for $80M but belief is, AZ could have had him for 70-75M.

JonHeyman	724644244288352257	2016-04-25T17:00:25	word is, one frazier proposal was patterned after kyle seager $100M/7 deal, which seems fair. reds intent on rebuild tho.
JonHeyman	724643884735803394	2016-04-25T16:59:00	frazier, big plus for improved chisox, tried hard to stay in cincy: made many proposals, met reds owner days before trade.

JonHeyman	689292669491789824	2016-01-19T03:45:53	hear mike ilitch was absolutely ready to sign chris davis before gm avila talked him out of it. j-up is (a bit) less $.
JonHeyman	689291112561901569	2016-01-19T03:39:42	angels absolutely must sign cespedes. they have mishmash in LF, lack offense at 4 positions. YC had .909 ops vs rhp in '15
JonHeyman	689288920643821568	2016-01-19T03:30:59	very nice tribute

JonHeyman	689281631912333312	2016-01-19T03:02:01	upton does well with 6 yr deal. gets $132.75M (via BNightengale). tigers fill LF, lose No. 2 pick. pads get draft choice.
JonHeyman	689278876112039936	2016-01-19T02:51:04	mike ilitch shows why he's 1 of best MLB owners. he was ready to go for davis before this. in tough al central, needed move

JonHeyman	688932371014520832	2016-01-18T03:54:11	positionally, cespedes is actually a better fit than davis for detroit. current LF candidates: gose, collins
JonHeyman	688931749917802496	2016-01-18T03:51:43	part of the tigers' hierarchy actually favored signing davis, but ultimately there were future luxury-tax concerns
JonHeyman	688931045991919616	2016-01-18T03:48:55	tigers are interesting in that they seriously considered davis before he went back to baltimore &amp; owner ilitch is in to win
JonHeyman	688930590360518656	2016-01-18T03:47:07	the tigers are at least giving some consideration to cespedes, joining chisox, mets, astros (pgammo) &amp; surely more

JonHeyman	683606809798639620	2016-01-03T11:12:18	AuthenticGiants i think it's that he was overshadowed by rickey. leadoff hitters generally i think dont get their due
JonHeyman	683606579904655360	2016-01-03T11:11:24	crawjo_1 Joelsherman1 baseball reference has them as most similar batters. so i'm guessing they are fairly close.
