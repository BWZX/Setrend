libbyanelson	717356528219660289	2016-04-05T14:21:38	"Papaoutai" is about fatherhood/abandonment more generally, not specifically about the genocide. (Also: It's a great song.)

libbyanelson	715159033666224128	2016-03-30T12:49:35	bencasselman Yeah. And it's tough because the types of colleges and types of stories are so different. It's not even really the same beat.
libbyanelson	715157459879522305	2016-03-30T12:43:20	bencasselman We're talking hundreds of thousands; I still get emails about it. One of the strangest things that's happened to me.

libbyanelson	714811053272604673	2016-03-29T13:46:50	alittlelilypad hey, sorry, just saw it. Because of the way federal funding is structured I think it's unlikely
libbyanelson	714810621800419328	2016-03-29T13:45:07	I think because it implies stupidity. "This is bad because it uses LONG WORDS that normal people clearly cannot grasp"

libbyanelson	710463068283736064	2016-03-17T13:49:29	Depends on the town, but it often can mean college students are a smaller share of the population. 
libbyanelson	710462874704068611	2016-03-17T13:48:43	Privates have fewer students to begin with — U. Iowa is 10x the size of Middlebury — and more from out-of-state, likely voting absentee.
libbyanelson	710462505244606465	2016-03-17T13:47:15	There's an easy explanation for this: Public colleges have many more students, and more who can vote in their state.

libbyanelson	710296472324087808	2016-03-17T02:47:30	tvoti (I went back through Slack to verify that)
libbyanelson	710296422055342080	2016-03-17T02:47:18	tvoti literally the first thing I ever said to you was how much I enjoyed your Americans convos at AV Club.   So the bar is high, I guess.
libbyanelson	710296277662232577	2016-03-17T02:46:43	special_boots I'd be so good too 🏅
libbyanelson	710295043018514432	2016-03-17T02:41:49	sarahkliff and while I love all dogs I can safely say I love Spencer's bully THE VERY LEAST OF ALL.
libbyanelson	710294514049687552	2016-03-17T02:39:43	sarahkliff NO. Poor guy! that is so scary, I am so sorry that happened to you both. Give him a gentle, non-injuring hug for me!
libbyanelson	710293304911515649	2016-03-17T02:34:55	sarahkliff O NO SPENCE
libbyanelson	710293220077522945	2016-03-17T02:34:34	crepeau now I have to wait WEEKS for a new episode so I'm just freaking out about the podcast also being back
libbyanelson	710292964858273792	2016-03-17T02:33:34	crepeau and I'm STILL losing my mind with joy over watching everyone else lose their mind over it being BAAAACK
libbyanelson	710292831198420992	2016-03-17T02:33:02	crepeau I uh  I've seen the first 4 already   🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊
libbyanelson	710292681994403840	2016-03-17T02:32:26	There goes my invitation to the "talking about The Americans" Olympics I guess
libbyanelson	710292595285630980	2016-03-17T02:32:05	Also this year tvoti and carolineframke are letting me yammer about it with them sometimes so I am going pro in obsessing about this show
libbyanelson	710291234070384640	2016-03-17T02:26:41	MrsFridayNext (in terms of quality)
libbyanelson	710291170430218240	2016-03-17T02:26:26	MrsFridayNext ohmygod. It is a show that only gets better. There's a dramatic jump around s1/e8, and another at the start of s3.
libbyanelson	710290535802601472	2016-03-17T02:23:54	Nothing makes me happier than the amount of TheAmericansFX chatter on my Twitters tonight. Best Show On Television.
libbyanelson	710290276791787524	2016-03-17T02:22:53	tvoti actually all of these are different from mine!
libbyanelson	710290205346025473	2016-03-17T02:22:36	tvoti I disagree so strongly with you about Pastor Tim and look forward to arguing about this for 12 weeks
libbyanelson	710289823337226244	2016-03-17T02:21:05	There is really no great way to measure the ideology of a Supreme Court nominee, I learned today.  
libbyanelson	710172905695531009	2016-03-16T18:36:29	MrsFridayNext also, uh, I've seen the first 4 episodes of S4 and [spoiler alert] [jkjkjkjk] THEY ARE SO GREATTTTTTT
libbyanelson	710172525435752448	2016-03-16T18:34:59	MrsFridayNext She is the Gryffindoriest Gryffindor who ever Gryffindored. Philip has a lot of Hufflepuff in him. (I will listen promise!)
libbyanelson	710168231542181888	2016-03-16T18:17:55	MrsFridayNext Ahhh, I just rewatched S1 and S2, super excited to listen to this. (Also: Elizabeth is a Gryffindor, right?)
libbyanelson	710142837053116416	2016-03-16T16:37:00	…because I can imagine that I would be hesitant to opine and mildly irritated about being asked. Turns out many sources don't feel that way!
libbyanelson	710142752340713472	2016-03-16T16:36:40	I find this reflected in my tactics too. I'm apologetic for asking about something outside people's direct expertise 
libbyanelson	710142420126715904	2016-03-16T16:35:21	alittlelilypad actually, the bigger problem in DC is probably the summer! it was surprisingly sweaty, and today is nice, not sticky
libbyanelson	710141548437086208	2016-03-16T16:31:53	Also someone just blamed my "stop telling women to smile" tweet for Donald Trump.
libbyanelson	710141359697612800	2016-03-16T16:31:08	I biked to work today and I can't stop talking about how fun and great it was. I'm pretty sure this Metro catastrophe is a bike lobby tactic
libbyanelson	710141266202337280	2016-03-16T16:30:46	bear_foot I want to read this so bad!  why is it so expensive to ship things, why must you live over an ocean so we can't share books

libbyanelson	709921957949661184	2016-03-16T01:59:19	It is so hard to not make a Common Core math joke right now. I just want you all to appreciate that.

libbyanelson	709913112531607552	2016-03-16T01:24:10	elisefoley the ironic thing is I am noted for my smiling resting face  (it doesn't exempt you, men just yell about your smile instead)

libbyanelson	709911343734906881	2016-03-16T01:17:08	But really, if you had told me a year ago that the last Common Core-supporting governor in the race would be Kasich…
libbyanelson	709909644462989312	2016-03-16T01:10:23	Congrats, GOP fans of the CommonCore and usedgov: After JohnKasich won Ohio, you still have a candidate who likes or will keep both.
libbyanelson	709909423456702465	2016-03-16T01:09:30	I think this point on who sensed that Trump could be chaotic/dangerous first is salient.

libbyanelson	709907133987471360	2016-03-16T01:00:24	And for many other things.  
libbyanelson	709905833992327170	2016-03-16T00:55:14	I realize whom they're subtweeting but the "dividing people" line always seems silly to me. You're picking a side! It's an election!

libbyanelson	706837878672904193	2016-03-07T13:44:17	Csigs I'm interested in the dilemma of how you cram more history into the academic year as "American history" gets longer
libbyanelson	706836529713385472	2016-03-07T13:38:55	Csigs I understand why, but that's really disappointing, especially as it's not an era their parents necessarily remember as adults now

libbyanelson	706834274335506434	2016-03-07T13:29:58	Do any history teachers follow me? Out of curiosity has, ie, the APUSH curriculum expanded to cover more of the '80s and '90s?

libbyanelson	706663466061467649	2016-03-07T02:11:14	But let's definitely ask it twice just in case.
libbyanelson	706663421538934784	2016-03-07T02:11:03	What is the chance that any person, let alone a Democratic presidential candidate, answers this question honestly?!

libbyanelson	702350436796395520	2016-02-24T04:32:47	amylaitinen1 it's a little more obscure than that (note the reporter who tweeted it got it slightly wrong)

libbyanelson	702344010766094337	2016-02-24T04:07:15	I think the world needs a Sulliview take, and reporting, on the NYT Success Academy coverage.

libbyanelson	692445395943817218	2016-01-27T20:33:42	Alex_Roarty 2% of our readers think Texas is in the Midwest, so, uh, take that, and/or I have questions for them.

libbyanelson	692440588130590720	2016-01-27T20:14:35	binarybits yes! I realized finally that "German ancestry states without mountains in them" was my real definition

libbyanelson	692438986984394752	2016-01-27T20:08:14	anyway, I guess my definition of "Midwest" leans on German/Scandinavian immigrant history, but I'm really curious about other people's.
libbyanelson	692437732803645440	2016-01-27T20:03:15	I didn't know Michigan and Ohio were in the Midwest until college. To me, with Pennsylvania, they were East/Rust Belt.
libbyanelson	692437607188434945	2016-01-27T20:02:45	however, no one EVER referred to Kansas that way when I was growing up there. We self-ID'd as Midwest. As do all my Nebraska relatives.
libbyanelson	692437454926790660	2016-01-27T20:02:08	as a Kansan, I agree that the Plains are geographically and in some ways culturally distinct
