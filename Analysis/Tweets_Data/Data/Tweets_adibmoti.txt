adibmoti	698255153833480192	2016-02-12T21:19:36	vaheelfan Do you have a sense of how the 3rd party revenue portion does? Its not recurring per se but seems the demand for OS is constant.
adibmoti	698254870952804352	2016-02-12T21:18:28	vaheelfan The purchase of $15m was 3rd party product not services. So about $2.2M of Gross $ for BSQR from that.
adibmoti	698254567184531457	2016-02-12T21:17:16	vaheelfan Actually it was $6.1m or 32% of A/R.
adibmoti	698242757681217536	2016-02-12T20:30:20	vaheelfan hon was $8m in a/r alone.

adibmoti	697666476619100161	2016-02-11T06:20:24	rubicon59 agree hence I think  buybacks work only for the rare business and management combo.
adibmoti	697666335619166208	2016-02-11T06:19:51	rubicon59 worse are cyclicals that buyback stock in good times and then dilute at much lower prices. Should it not be the other way
adibmoti	697666109026148352	2016-02-11T06:18:57	rubicon59 when the biz shrinks, the debt is left over and stock price is usually much lower  than buyback prices. Sometimes drastically
