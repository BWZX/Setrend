afneil	725720016751058944	2016-04-28T16:15:09	No I don't 
afneil	725719109187547137	2016-04-28T16:11:33	Livingstone claimed Hitler supported Zionism -- so it's very different. 
afneil	725716160474394626	2016-04-28T15:59:50	afneil The main thing to me is not whether or not Hitler wanted Jews removed to Palestine, but why Ken raised the issue at all. Bizarre.
afneil	725717718998106112	2016-04-28T16:06:02	It's not a fact. He was against them forming their own state. Even Madagascar deportation plan involved SS guards. 
afneil	725715247756115968	2016-04-28T15:56:12	Not quite. I was editor of the Glasgow University Guardian. 
afneil	725715003437895681	2016-04-28T15:55:14	No. He just wanted Jews to leave; didn't care where. When war made that impossible he went for holocaust instead. 
afneil	725712460481748993	2016-04-28T15:45:08	Actually, the Nazis just wanted rid of the Jews. Didn't really care where they went.  
afneil	725708711205986304	2016-04-28T15:30:14	Wrong. Hitler supporting Zionism is just a long running anti-semitic trope.

afneil	704392286474469377	2016-02-29T19:46:22	I am indeed quoting actual. But forecast is not made up. It's official forecast. Still not ¬£55m/day 
afneil	704391895359873025	2016-02-29T19:44:49	That's a fair point but we did have huge farm and regional subsidies before we joined EU. So not necessarily saving 
afneil	704388075506503680	2016-02-29T19:29:38	poet_peoples afneil she's arguing he's wrong to agree with her figures.
afneil	704390949716291585	2016-02-29T19:41:04	Possibly. But that's hard to quantify and since all major EU powers are members of NATO, not sure if EU = peace gain 
afneil	704390036373053448	2016-02-29T19:37:26	Understood. People must decide if it's worth it. But even ¬£11bn forecast is not ¬£55m/day. Should u tell Nige or me? 
afneil	704389181523542016	2016-02-29T19:34:02	But I don't think OUT says we wouldn't have farm or regional payments ex-EU. Though New Zealand decided not. 
afneil	704387618289508353	2016-02-29T19:27:49	afneil I'm an Out but won't quibble with any facts you air.

afneil	704385608601489408	2016-02-29T19:19:50	You're depending on a forecast. Like the prime minister! I simply tweeted the 2015 actual 
afneil	704383624557281280	2016-02-29T19:11:57	You have to get up pretty early in the morning to catch out afneil 
afneil	704383611680772096	2016-02-29T19:11:54	afneil Indeed- see here for full breakdown 
afneil	704384756545404929	2016-02-29T19:16:27	That is true. But ¬£4.5bn mainly Farm and Regional subsidies, which we'd probably continue in some form. 
afneil	704384028405796865	2016-02-29T19:13:33	It's for 2015 actual. Forecast 2016 is ¬£11bn but it's a forecast. 
afneil	704383769080422400	2016-02-29T19:12:32	Your table gives net net of ¬£8.5bn for 2015. Exactly my figure. 2016 is a forecast.  
afneil	704383108641120256	2016-02-29T19:09:54	afneil thanks for being the only one who has given me this information aneilthebest
afneil	704383180783144961	2016-02-29T19:10:11	Then you have to deduct what we get back in regional aid and farm subsidies, some of which we'd still spend ex-EU 
afneil	704382502316740609	2016-02-29T19:07:30	Yes. Cost has to be measured against benefits. But they are much more a matter of dispute! 
afneil	704381863251595265	2016-02-29T19:04:57	We do NOT send ¬£55m. Rebate deducted before we send anything. 
afneil	704381471868456960	2016-02-29T19:03:24	The facts: gross cost of EU ¬£18bn/year. ¬£5bn rebate deducted 1st. So we send ¬£13bn. Then ¬£4.5bn back in EU spending. Net cost ¬£8.5bn.
afneil	704380830387462145	2016-02-29T19:00:51	No. Rebate deducted before we send fee. More money then comes back. But EU determines how it's spent. 
afneil	704380421233119232	2016-02-29T18:59:13	The rebate is deducted before we pay the membership fee. It's up to you to decide of the net still too much. 
afneil	704379288695541760	2016-02-29T18:54:43	That's for you to decide. My job is to give you the accurate figure.
