TweetLeni	702543729052274689	2016-02-24T17:20:52	Look at WMT this is working on a pivot and may even fill gap just below but its hard to be too bearish o a pivoting chart. On watch to buy
TweetLeni	702543278802128896	2016-02-24T17:19:04	Unusual activity...also known as buying or selling.
TweetLeni	702543015013916672	2016-02-24T17:18:02	KymLang days are tough here..choppy
TweetLeni	702542888333398016	2016-02-24T17:17:31	We are also seeing new strength in some retailers M URBN so keeps my bearishness to short term gaps only
TweetLeni	702542586456760322	2016-02-24T17:16:19	If we break these choppy lows across these major indices then I will get more defensive. But keep in mind we are very oversold here
TweetLeni	702542359142207488	2016-02-24T17:15:25	Keep your macros in mind. We can just be filling gaps in DIA SPY QQQ and still just choppy sideways. So its hard to be too bearish unless
TweetLeni	702542024319361024	2016-02-24T17:14:05	KymLang xo tough call here
TweetLeni	702541544453238784	2016-02-24T17:12:11	KymLang I would prefer to heed the candle and know we are very oversold here and that a reversal is quite possible
TweetLeni	702541359580880897	2016-02-24T17:11:27	KymLang for ex maybe KRE goes lo'r but only gets to 33 and the reversal candle holds. I dont know. Some technicians would say wait

TweetLeni	702175109348511744	2016-02-23T16:56:06	MorindaWealth yes, but thats a very important distinction. The difference is measured in $$$ dollars and cents.
TweetLeni	702174813859745792	2016-02-23T16:54:56	MorindaWealth even if you look at short term we could have called staples value back in Aug 2015.
TweetLeni	702174416659226624	2016-02-23T16:53:21	MorindaWealth for ex, I believe their is good value still in staples, but these are currently momentum plays. They were value plays in 09
TweetLeni	702174009337782274	2016-02-23T16:51:44	MorindaWealth by that measure anything that has remaining value 80 to 100 for example has value. Common mistake.
