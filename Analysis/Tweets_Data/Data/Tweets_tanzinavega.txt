tanzinavega	722854804825841664	2016-04-20T18:29:50	Why so few editors of color? Because we don't *develop* that talent. We don't support it. And we need to. We must.
tanzinavega	722854577444261888	2016-04-20T18:28:55	Without an editor to back you up and fight for your stories to get told (and told well) you won't survive in a newsroom.
tanzinavega	722854302142738432	2016-04-20T18:27:50	Editors yield an **enormous** amount of power. I've found myself playing both roles in creating beats, pitching stories etc about race.
tanzinavega	722854028678311936	2016-04-20T18:26:45	That's why the word "diversity" is seen as shallow and ineffective. Because it only goes so far.
tanzinavega	722853829465604097	2016-04-20T18:25:57	Newsrooms cannot justify "diversity" by hiring entry level reporters only. The editing ranks must be "diversified" at all levels.
tanzinavega	722853587613671424	2016-04-20T18:24:59	This puts an enormous amount of pressure and responsibility on the reporter to defend, explain work and context.
tanzinavega	722853151557070848	2016-04-20T18:23:15	When writing about race I've sometimes found that editors who don't "get it" are more likely to cut something than to explore it further.
tanzinavega	722852906907467777	2016-04-20T18:22:17	In many newsrooms, you live and die by your editor. They green light stories, help you figure out tough topics and should protect you.
tanzinavega	722852703911608320	2016-04-20T18:21:29	But we also have a severe lack of diversity in our collective editing ranks.
tanzinavega	722852460549681153	2016-04-20T18:20:31	We are in a "race beat" moment now, so pitching these stories *should* be somewhat easier.
tanzinavega	722852223630200833	2016-04-20T18:19:34	And not just to edit "race and ethnicity" stories.

tanzinavega	707986085092134913	2016-03-10T17:46:51	tanzinavega So many issues arise, especially at the intersection of journalism/understanding and reporting of communities.
tanzinavega	707985327428911104	2016-03-10T17:43:50	Ugh. THIS!  
tanzinavega	707985054304231424	2016-03-10T17:42:45	timmcrae77 soledadobrien DrewKerr I am a CUNY grad, City University of New York. Was in the 1st journalism grad class. cunyjschool
tanzinavega	707984584458244097	2016-03-10T17:40:53	Had a Latina student tell me she didn't want to cover Latinos as a journalist. "Then don't" I told her. Cover business, tech, politics.
tanzinavega	707983998031679488	2016-03-10T17:38:33	MickiMaynard that's where people get tripped up. Trust me. I've been on "diversity" committees etc.
tanzinavega	707983814157594624	2016-03-10T17:37:49	MickiMaynard But the argument for diversity ISNT about doing it for the sake of doing it. Its bc we cant tell the stories of US without it.
tanzinavega	707982050020761601	2016-03-10T17:30:49	tanzinavega you have to pray that managers prize diversity. Some do, and some don't.
tanzinavega	707981939437912064	2016-03-10T17:30:22	tanzinavega Newsrooms often use Ivy schools as examples in their stories more than others. 99.9% of America didn't go to Ivy's.
tanzinavega	707980977730162688	2016-03-10T17:26:33	MickiMaynard and that's particularly troubling for newsrooms.
tanzinavega	707979764712214528	2016-03-10T17:21:44	MickiMaynard exactly. And "kinship" is like "culture fit" It only works for those who are like the person doing the hiring, managing.
tanzinavega	707978999272751104	2016-03-10T17:18:41	tanzinavega people recommend their friends, and editors hire those with whom they feel a kinship. If you're all Ivy, that's what you get.
tanzinavega	707978784205619201	2016-03-10T17:17:50	For me personally, the tension comes from not believing that I deserve anything. 
tanzinavega	707978203911077888	2016-03-10T17:15:32	MickiMaynard Of course. This isnt suggesting people aren't working. We all are. It's highlighting certain creds that are valued over others
tanzinavega	707977932820619265	2016-03-10T17:14:27	MorganJerkins abbydphillip Moderated a panel yest. where the qx of pressure not to fail came up. Are we even allowed?
tanzinavega	707977590427013120	2016-03-10T17:13:05	tanzinavega abbydphillip Yes, please. Let's do this.
tanzinavega	707977417462251523	2016-03-10T17:12:24	abbydphillip I've been asked where I went to school. Huh? After 15 yrs exp., and an MA, but I digress.
tanzinavega	707976785720426496	2016-03-10T17:09:53	abbydphillip absolutely. That's why the "merit" argument has always struck me as hollow.
tanzinavega	707976233460637697	2016-03-10T17:07:42	tanzinavega Yes, I totally agree. But there are other sources of advantage in newsrooms. Heredity, class, income being major factors
tanzinavega	707976180700483588	2016-03-10T17:07:29	have met too many people who believe "elite" education is more important than experience 
tanzinavega	707976583957635073	2016-03-10T17:09:05	MickiMaynard Thing is, the big media markets are here. And privilege often begets privilege.
tanzinavega	707974642783412224	2016-03-10T17:01:23	abbydphillip Imagine *NOT* having that credential.
tanzinavega	707974540442345472	2016-03-10T17:00:58	Whew - we need to talk about this. MorganJerkins 
tanzinavega	707974262037024768	2016-03-10T16:59:52	"It hurts the poor..when they can‚Äôt see themselves reflected in the collective mirror that is the media." Ehrenreich 
tanzinavega	707973777645244416	2016-03-10T16:57:56	tanzinavega I suspect Ivy grads stay clustered on the East Coast. But many state college grads land jobs west of the Hudson.
tanzinavega	707973440372924416	2016-03-10T16:56:36	MickiMaynard That's refreshing.
tanzinavega	707973318553575424	2016-03-10T16:56:07	tanzinavega I've actually found it to be opposite beyond the East Coast.

tanzinavega	707972111470628864	2016-03-10T16:51:19	tanzinavega For digital producers, I think the reel matters the most. That's been my experience.
tanzinavega	707972583686275074	2016-03-10T16:53:12	As a Ivy grad, I agree with all this.  
tanzinavega	707972625788739584	2016-03-10T16:53:22	LouFoglia That's a "merit" argument that's often made without taking into account the things that lead to "merit": access, opportunity, $$
tanzinavega	707971716132245504	2016-03-10T16:49:45	How much value do we place on surviving poverty, racism, sexism etc.?

tanzinavega	707970941352075264	2016-03-10T16:46:40	Newsrooms, some more than others, tend to value Ivy grads with little to no experience more than other types of experience.
