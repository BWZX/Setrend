adamgurri	723605973194182657	2016-04-22T20:14:42	GrahamDPeterson But as you alluded, in rhetoric, the credibility and authority of the speaker matters.
adamgurri	723605872476344320	2016-04-22T20:14:18	GrahamDPeterson Too many people think arguments are like math. So if I say "2 + 2 is 4" and you say "you're a liar" that seems...irrelevant
adamgurri	723605577084055553	2016-04-22T20:13:08	GrahamDPeterson The problem is that people think in terms of (modern) formal logic, rather than classical rhetoric.

adamgurri	723548249248923648	2016-04-22T16:25:20	RPLongSW The meaning of words is in their use, and I wouldn't denigrate what you seem to mean by it.

adamgurri	723547545708990464	2016-04-22T16:22:32	RPLongSW Also via akiva_malamet, this is on my reading list:

adamgurri	723546804835500032	2016-04-22T16:19:35	RPLongSW Or in the example of the father in your first post, really doing it "in the spirit of fathership" vs going through the motions.
adamgurri	723546681615224833	2016-04-22T16:19:06	RPLongSW ...seems to line up with how I think of "spirit" as in "the spirit vs the letter of the rules" or "the spirit of friendship."
adamgurri	723546455919742976	2016-04-22T16:18:12	RPLongSW Ryan, I don't think we disagree on authenticity. The word polyvalent, as all words are. The way you seem to be using it...
adamgurri	723542304691204100	2016-04-22T16:01:42	sklivvz If X is a trusted public finance expert, then at minimum a case has been made that the argument is worth evaluating further.

adamgurri	723538846756024320	2016-04-22T15:47:58	sklivvz It's credibility all the way down. It's just a matter of what is under scrutiny. Do you trust: the person making the argument,
adamgurri	723536198732550149	2016-04-22T15:37:27	sklivvz If we do not trust the person making the case, a compelling case is unlikely to have been made.

adamgurri	723531890393780224	2016-04-22T15:20:19	pxdelaney Certainly true. But "You don't know what you're talking about so it's not worth getting into the details of your argument", while
adamgurri	723530978744999936	2016-04-22T15:16:42	pxdelaney Cases like that, where it's directly the logic that's being called out as wrong, is certainly a fallacy. Otherwise, not.
adamgurri	723530817272721410	2016-04-22T15:16:04	pxdelaney I think the origin of the term didn't take the form of "arguing that 2 +2 = 4 is wrong b/c the person making it is bad"
adamgurri	723530673282244608	2016-04-22T15:15:29	clipperhouse a case *cannot* be made for a given argument by discrediting the person making it, but you do say it *hasn't* been made.
adamgurri	723530564754649088	2016-04-22T15:15:03	clipperhouse Depends. In establishing evidence, so much depends on trust and credibility. It's true that you might not demonstrate that
adamgurri	723530358914953216	2016-04-22T15:14:14	pxdelaney Nor would I say I love ad hominem arguments. It's more that I disagree with it being a logical fallacy.
adamgurri	723530268791975936	2016-04-22T15:13:53	pxdelaney I would not disagree that people are often acting in bad faith when they are accusing others of doing so.

adamgurri	723524220773371904	2016-04-22T14:49:51	lessdismalsci I think there's some sense in which it's credibility all the way down. To analyze the logic or math of a thing...
adamgurri	723523880489496576	2016-04-22T14:48:30	TacoAuditor Yes, but it was snark-as-public-service, rather than cheap, profit-driven snark.

adamgurri	722457847653625857	2016-04-19T16:12:28	DrewFitzAndrew yeah, fair critique. Inspired by Gadamer on portraits in relation to what they portray; the portrait is definitely a game
adamgurri	722457167106850820	2016-04-19T16:09:45	DrewFitzAndrew I went back and forth on that but in context the painting is a move in a bigger game, though indeed a game itself.

adamgurri	722434475636977664	2016-04-19T14:39:35	themattsimpson That is, he likes Game Theory but not (as you say) naive Game Theory. (cc JBriggeman)

adamgurri	722434049051123712	2016-04-19T14:37:54	themattsimpson Fair point. Though all typically boil down to "find the solution that yields the most utility," no?

adamgurri	722433246403956736	2016-04-19T14:34:42	This focus on the particularity of games does a better job hinting at the broadness of human experience.
adamgurri	722433094201040896	2016-04-19T14:34:06	Some games aren't even meant to be won! Think of the game of telephone; purely for amusement and diversion.
adamgurri	722432858061717504	2016-04-19T14:33:10	Whereas Wittgenstein used the word "game" precisely for its particularity---Chess is very different from solitaire, or dodge ball.
adamgurri	722432663886368768	2016-04-19T14:32:23	Variations among game theory games are more like the different starting positions they use to train chess players, than different games.

adamgurri	721907200130736128	2016-04-18T03:44:23	TacoAuditor when your answer is going to be "duh," one wonders the purpose in offering any answer at all.
adamgurri	721905935120232449	2016-04-18T03:39:21	TacoAuditor you have successfully trolled me this evening. Good night
adamgurri	721905557163139072	2016-04-18T03:37:51	TacoAuditor I'm sorry Gadamer didn't ask you what a novel or interesting topic would be before writing his book?
adamgurri	721905219936849920	2016-04-18T03:36:31	TacoAuditor no one believes it and the idea's been around forever, eh
adamgurri	721905110503264256	2016-04-18T03:36:05	TacoAuditor it just means you're picking specific people to respond to
adamgurri	721904897252265984	2016-04-18T03:35:14	TacoAuditor the fact that there's a specific tradition you're contending with doesn't mean they're the only ones to have the idea ever
adamgurri	721904717593513985	2016-04-18T03:34:31	TacoAuditor on his way to a much a much larger point.
adamgurri	721904632658804736	2016-04-18T03:34:11	TacoAuditor but I dunno why you're going for the throat here, Gadamer basically tried to flesh out the recent people's arguments
adamgurri	721904313879109632	2016-04-18T03:32:55	TacoAuditor I encountered many albeit mediocre artists who buy into the notion of avoiding "contaminating" their work via influences
adamgurri	721903638042513408	2016-04-18T03:30:14	TacoAuditor no one is arguing that this was the only time and place that idea arose

adamgurri	721902611385991168	2016-04-18T03:26:09	TacoAuditor at least the school he was responding to was drawing on Kant
adamgurri	721902459816423424	2016-04-18T03:25:33	TacoAuditor there was a prominent aesthetic theory in which art was the pure expression of the subjective experience of genius
adamgurri	721901690102882309	2016-04-18T03:22:29	TacoAuditor back. To specially connect to the older humanism.
adamgurri	721901611707195393	2016-04-18T03:22:11	TacoAuditor oh dude. That's exactly what Gadamer does. He's arguing against a specific trend from the nineteenth century. He wants to go
adamgurri	721901326138011649	2016-04-18T03:21:03	marjorieromeyn just the worst
adamgurri	721900685734854656	2016-04-18T03:18:30	TacoAuditor the field probably looked different at that point!
adamgurri	721900544898543616	2016-04-18T03:17:56	TacoAuditor and was the result of ~30 years of work
adamgurri	721900440519106560	2016-04-18T03:17:31	TacoAuditor dude this book came out in like 1960
adamgurri	721899951157026816	2016-04-18T03:15:35	TacoAuditor artists too. For instance, Goethe.
adamgurri	721899864909606912	2016-04-18T03:15:14	TacoAuditor he draws on a lot of specific thinkers. Granting it's all German, but reminds me of stuff I've seen more anecdotally here.
adamgurri	721899583899635712	2016-04-18T03:14:07	TacoAuditor a huge tradition beginning with Kant and running through the German idealists and Neo-Kantians, which had influence elsewhere

adamgurri	721870243593863168	2016-04-18T01:17:32	daveliakos decided it was time for my first T&amp;M reread after.

adamgurri	721870029755719680	2016-04-18T01:16:41	daveliakos but it was an excellent summary of Heidegger, Gadamer, Wittgenstein, and the background of their thought + its influences, plus
adamgurri	721869886327271425	2016-04-18T01:16:07	daveliakos I recently read a book called The Two Horizons, by Thiselton. I've no particular interest in biblical hermeneutics...

adamgurri	721830056641851392	2016-04-17T22:37:51	SanguineEmpiric It's hard to read Taleb's tweets over the past few days and think Noahpinion is the moralizing one.

adamgurri	721077909167976448	2016-04-15T20:49:05	azmyth2 Right, that's the sort of thing that moves one towards being a rule rather than act utilitarian, for instance.
adamgurri	721077763915034624	2016-04-15T20:48:30	calixte maradydd literally my favorite thing I learned when researching Belgium in the 3rd grade.
adamgurri	721077201349844992	2016-04-15T20:46:16	azmyth2 Last point (sorry!): having good consequences is definitely a good reason to do something, but it's not the *only* kind of reason.
adamgurri	721075758567964672	2016-04-15T20:40:32	azmyth2 By living our life, trading stories, connecting with people, we struggle with what it means to be good, in our own judgment.
adamgurri	721075625507872769	2016-04-15T20:40:00	azmyth2 further: from the moment we can talk people start telling us stories and serving as examples of what it means to be good.
adamgurri	721075493244637184	2016-04-15T20:39:29	azmyth2 Short version: the structure of our lives points towards what it means to be good. Less short: 
adamgurri	721075080760029185	2016-04-15T20:37:50	maradydd Oh, great to know! :) May just take you up on that. A place to crash changes the calculus of when we could go...
adamgurri	721074958038933504	2016-04-15T20:37:21	Anyway, if you're bored, this was my big thing on how I think traditions work  As limited as my knowledge is.
adamgurri	721074066912845824	2016-04-15T20:33:49	maradydd lol! Nice.
adamgurri	721073739186704384	2016-04-15T20:32:30	maradydd That sounds awesome. I really need to get out there...
adamgurri	721073393160876032	2016-04-15T20:31:08	maradydd a proud part of who they are, in other words
adamgurri	721073355936395264	2016-04-15T20:30:59	maradydd Just part of their belief in the importance of getting every last drop out of everything, not being wasteful with money/in general
adamgurri	721073218501664768	2016-04-15T20:30:26	maradydd She had an example of this tool the Dutch use _just_ to get the very last drop of tomato sauce out of a jar. Prudent! Not really
adamgurri	721072872605806594	2016-04-15T20:29:04	maradydd But DeirdreMcClosk likes to emphasize that there's also deeper values going on in the background; pride in a craft for instance
adamgurri	721072751356854274	2016-04-15T20:28:35	maradydd There's a lot of awesome stuff that comes out of a roll-up-your-sleeves, get it done type attitude/set of values.
adamgurri	721072555847716864	2016-04-15T20:27:48	maradydd I do not mean to denigrate that, and apologize if I did.
adamgurri	721072121204600833	2016-04-15T20:26:05	claudeakinsmask Which I believe is simply false (see link to post above)
adamgurri	721072063633571841	2016-04-15T20:25:51	claudeakinsmask but we needn't debate the point---I have in mind a very specific consequentialist model of how communities work.
adamgurri	721071991684493316	2016-04-15T20:25:34	claudeakinsmask Ah well, that's where things get tricky, in terms of what one means by consequences :)
adamgurri	721071867084324864	2016-04-15T20:25:04	Cinesias It's true, though I've heard he can be quite bad in person lol
adamgurri	721071800440987651	2016-04-15T20:24:48	maradydd I'm not saying consequences don't matter. I have in mind a specific consequentialist model of community.
adamgurri	721071354683006976	2016-04-15T20:23:02	mgurri Also very domain specific in his strengths.
adamgurri	721071249150095360	2016-04-15T20:22:37	mgurri Trying to get yourself blocked? ;)
adamgurri	721071096502558720	2016-04-15T20:22:00	Cinesias Back when we were on more friendly terms, maybe. Now, meh. He's acted too awful to too many people I like or respect.
adamgurri	721070928692686848	2016-04-15T20:21:20	jonathanglick lol that's our Taleb!
adamgurri	721070822467702786	2016-04-15T20:20:55	mrgasmaskman Thanks. So it goes. I don't think people take him very seriously when he goes off on that sort of thing. Still annoying.
adamgurri	721070559153496065	2016-04-15T20:19:52	mrgasmaskman neither of which are true, so fuck him pretty much.
adamgurri	721070490585067520	2016-04-15T20:19:36	mrgasmaskman Yeah, so it goes. But in the same week he implied an old professor of mine was a plagiarist, and a friend was fired,
adamgurri	721070338637963266	2016-04-15T20:19:00	jonathanglick I was not! What was that about?
adamgurri	721069905622212612	2016-04-15T20:17:16	Cinesias So it goes! I'm more amused than anything at this point.
adamgurri	721069827708882945	2016-04-15T20:16:58	mrgasmaskman So he blocked me lol. Then he unblocked me recently for some reason. Didn't last, obviously
adamgurri	721069752345563137	2016-04-15T20:16:40	mrgasmaskman then I suggested that, our cognitive biases being what they are, he should be more respectful to people he disagreed with.
adamgurri	721069676776800256	2016-04-15T20:16:22	mrgasmaskman first time I snarked at him. Then he deleted his account and left Twitter for a while. Second time we'd been friendly;
adamgurri	721069487424987136	2016-04-15T20:15:37	I'm reminded of mattfrost, I think, who often refers to "util-bots" trying to act human.
adamgurri	721069388665917444	2016-04-15T20:15:13	This is the problem with consequentialist-derived "traditionalism". It's clear they've no clue how tradition or communities actually operate
adamgurri	721069273133748224	2016-04-15T20:14:46	MeadBadger I just keep getting worse! lol
adamgurri	721069187423191040	2016-04-15T20:14:25	mrgasmaskman Third time, lol
adamgurri	721069027175579649	2016-04-15T20:13:47	Cinesias Well he banned me when I suggested he should be more respectful of people he disagreed with, then recently unbanned. Didn't last..
adamgurri	721068867896918017	2016-04-15T20:13:09	And his approach to Twitter is pretty much attempt to dole out punishment to charlatans (or whatever) to discourage bad behavior.
adamgurri	721068561368801280	2016-04-15T20:11:56	His defense of religion and community and such are the consequentialist, empty variety 
adamgurri	721068385556164609	2016-04-15T20:11:14	He claims to be into virtue but then his interpretation of the Stoics is super consequentialist. Which...is the opposite of the point.
adamgurri	721068238029918208	2016-04-15T20:10:39	Cinesias it's one of those things where I used to admire him and it soured...I admit to bitterness haha
adamgurri	721068179271913472	2016-04-15T20:10:25	Since I'm already blocked; I've said it before, and I'll say it again: nntaleb is fundamentally a utilitarian. Consequentialist at best.
adamgurri	721066023974236161	2016-04-15T20:01:51	Today I got blocked by a Noahpinion truther

adamgurri	721064496622649344	2016-04-15T19:55:47	FranklinH3000 Spivonomist Third time he's done it---I think this means I can get a secret character in Binding of Isaac?
adamgurri	721063759389855745	2016-04-15T19:52:51	MorlockP Spivonomist He deleted his account and left twitter for a while. Then I guess he unblocked a bunch of ppl at one point.
adamgurri	721063455378272259	2016-04-15T19:51:39	MorlockP Spivonomist This is actually my third time. It's almost comforting at this point.

adamgurri	721060293414166528	2016-04-15T19:39:05	SanguineEmpiric MeadBadger He we think of Locke (for example) as providing first principles, when he's just abridging English tradition.

adamgurri	721027861755400192	2016-04-15T17:30:12	That's also my own reading of Oakeshott, whose ideas I admit are often a bit elusive.
adamgurri	721027757522743296	2016-04-15T17:29:48	Of course both seem to implicitly make the history of philosophy an important subject.
adamgurri	721027629655138305	2016-04-15T17:29:17	Typical history of philosophy: X philosophers are why we think the way we do now Oakeshott: X philosophers were barometers for their time.

adamgurri	720659574878035968	2016-04-14T17:06:46	MeadBadger This also explains why I found urban fantasy even easier. Obviously I'm familiar with urban (American) settings.
adamgurri	720658489895469061	2016-04-14T17:02:27	MeadBadger For a long time I thought it was a writing style thing, but you're absolutely right. It comes down to the tropes.

adamgurri	713028514576994305	2016-03-24T15:43:39	TheDrewSummitt Feels like philosophy of mind is one of those few places where, even now, there's respected non-materialists.
adamgurri	713027046163787776	2016-03-24T15:37:49	TheDrewSummitt Definitely a great survey of arguments and positions so far.

adamgurri	713009049479069696	2016-03-24T14:26:19	NateRethorn Making time to write even a paragraph or two on a regular basis can make a world of difference, in my experience.
adamgurri	713008386590294016	2016-03-24T14:23:41	NateRethorn I think such things come in waves. Before umlautmag my writing had slowed to a crawl. Then suddenly it came easy. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
adamgurri	713007393114832896	2016-03-24T14:19:44	NateRethorn And so professors cry with joy when they get anything remotely readable. Not that professors are good writers, either!
adamgurri	713007279264698368	2016-03-24T14:19:17	NateRethorn Sadly, if you have any talent for writing at all, it becomes a matter of being the tallest pygmy. College kids can't write.
adamgurri	713006818709082112	2016-03-24T14:17:27	NateRethorn Yeah, being able to ace an essay by writing it the morning of did not help me build character. Nor improve my writing.

adamgurri	713006037822021632	2016-03-24T14:14:21	JasonKuznicki I think that's wrong, because of Duhem–Quine; falsification is just as capable of being neutralized by further context.
adamgurri	713005289277169664	2016-03-24T14:11:22	JasonKuznicki Go on...
adamgurri	713005164249096193	2016-03-24T14:10:52	approach a subject in small enough bits to fit a finite amount of writing, it helps overcome the idea that you have to know all to know any.
adamgurri	713004880835846145	2016-03-24T14:09:45	Writing in public is not for everyone. But writing is such a great tool for thinking. And by forcing yourself to think about how you can

adamgurri	713003291169452032	2016-03-24T14:03:26	Usually, though, the main difference between people who find it easy to write (like me) from people who don't is the arrogance of the former

adamgurri	711932041332453377	2016-03-21T15:06:40	breathesgelatin They definitely have philosophical systems, but the system isn't really the point, in a way. They're in conversation,

adamgurri	711931779209424897	2016-03-21T15:05:37	breathesgelatin But he makes no reference to the existence of those impulses, he tries to refer only to the conversation of philosophy.
adamgurri	711931547545378816	2016-03-21T15:04:42	breathesgelatin So take Rawls. He seems like he's trying to construct this theoretical edifice to justify egalitarian/democratic impulses
adamgurri	711928415134334976	2016-03-21T14:52:15	breathesgelatin I think many of the sins of rationalism stem from importing assumptions from art etc but pretending to be self-contained.
adamgurri	711928304387891200	2016-03-21T14:51:49	breathesgelatin Something I like about Heidegger &amp; Gadamer is their comfort with leaving questions open.

adamgurri	711921512211734528	2016-03-21T14:24:50	breathesgelatin Apparently Heidegger characterized his late work as attempting to revive the spirit of poetry. That is immensely appealing.

adamgurri	710572361465122816	2016-03-17T21:03:47	pxdelaney If so though, it's worse than the fake moving to Canada thing.

adamgurri	710107358274441216	2016-03-16T14:16:02	ClarkHat I said---look, I find some of Heidegger's ideas valuable. But he was a card-carrying Nazi. I feel it's my responsibility to
adamgurri	710107261251805184	2016-03-16T14:15:38	ClarkHat The frustrating conversation that provoked the piece was over Illiberal Reformers, and the tie between progressivism &amp; eugenics
adamgurri	710107134655123456	2016-03-16T14:15:08	ClarkHat Note I'm not trying to discredit any idea in the piece, but get people to take ownership of the scary potential in most or all.
adamgurri	710106928731578368	2016-03-16T14:14:19	ClarkHat Cross-pollination of ideas and practices kinda muddies the history of a given set of ideas you're looking at.
adamgurri	710106749169225728	2016-03-16T14:13:36	ClarkHat Moreover, the current violent element has much in common with other modern terror movements, from the 70s left to old anarchists.
adamgurri	710106513180905476	2016-03-16T14:12:40	ClarkHat Doesn't seem right to me. Islam is a huge, old, diverse tradition. The genealogy of ideas and practices is vast.

adamgurri	709832560973578244	2016-03-15T20:04:05	DrewFitzAndrew I realized I should never have tried to answer that question categorically, but rather consulted the debates among
adamgurri	709832466731831297	2016-03-15T20:03:42	DrewFitzAndrew At some point when people asked for the Nth time "would your philosophy have made people realize slavery was bad,"

adamgurri	709830467328090114	2016-03-15T19:55:46	DrewFitzAndrew But yeah, it's true. Coming to grips with your own capacity for malice is hard.
adamgurri	709830315049672704	2016-03-15T19:55:09	DrewFitzAndrew Never me, but I understand other people are that way. The poor souls.

adamgurri	709787019631796225	2016-03-15T17:03:07	Econ_Marshall We should probably leave it here, as we've entered a circle (given I linked to that One Child Policy article on this topic).
adamgurri	709786156670570497	2016-03-15T16:59:41	Econ_Marshall And his legacy.
adamgurri	709786120570204162	2016-03-15T16:59:32	Econ_Marshall I'm not denying what you're accusing the right of, but it seems odd to bring up when we're talking about Richard Ely.
adamgurri	709785927846137857	2016-03-15T16:58:47	Econ_Marshall Some tens of thousands were forcibly sterilized in the US and Buck v Bell was never overturned...nor immigrant restrictions.
adamgurri	709785253657911296	2016-03-15T16:56:06	Econ_Marshall In reading Heidegger, I feel I have a serious responsibility to keep in mind the man w/these ideas saw virtue in the Nazis.
adamgurri	709785137937039360	2016-03-15T16:55:38	Econ_Marshall Heidegger was a Nazi apologist. There's no getting around that, no matter how I find any particular idea interesting.
adamgurri	709785037647056896	2016-03-15T16:55:14	Econ_Marshall I am currently reading Heidegger, for instance, because of his influence on a philosopher whose ideas I respect. (1/2)
adamgurri	709784890087186432	2016-03-15T16:54:39	Econ_Marshall I think this is exactly the kind of deflection that gets in the way of soul searching that ought to be done by all.
adamgurri	709784785862987776	2016-03-15T16:54:14	Econ_Marshall What is especially worse is making it the _law of the land_ that that is what will be done in such cases.
adamgurri	709784709656662016	2016-03-15T16:53:56	Econ_Marshall Yes. And I think being kidnapped and having an invasive medical procedure performed against your will is worse.
adamgurri	709783051652472832	2016-03-15T16:47:21	Econ_Marshall Have you read accounts of what happens when you break the One Child Law?
adamgurri	709782997722144768	2016-03-15T16:47:08	Econ_Marshall Given that I'm against either, I don't see the relevance. I also find "mandatory birth control" a bit...too generous a term.
adamgurri	709782073167499265	2016-03-15T16:43:28	Econ_Marshall In general I think we should all be better about publicly wrestling with the mixed legacy of those ideas we admire.
adamgurri	709781870603542529	2016-03-15T16:42:39	Econ_Marshall Anyway, I'm glad you wrote this followup, and that a longer piece was written about Illiberal Reformers; I will read it.
adamgurri	709781272495788032	2016-03-15T16:40:17	Econ_Marshall To give but one example... 
adamgurri	709780254466957312	2016-03-15T16:36:14	Econ_Marshall JBriggeman the burst of "actually, China's One Child Policy is a good idea" pieces that occurred recently.
adamgurri	709780132328816641	2016-03-15T16:35:45	Econ_Marshall JBriggeman has been severed. When you say "the exclusionary aspect is essentially absent" today, I have to think of
adamgurri	709780001357492224	2016-03-15T16:35:14	Econ_Marshall JBriggeman However, I think it's too convenient to think that the doctrines are cleanly separable, or that their influence
adamgurri	709779849737592833	2016-03-15T16:34:37	Econ_Marshall JBriggeman as proof that an idea one already disagrees with ought to be discredited.
adamgurri	709779688416256000	2016-03-15T16:33:59	Econ_Marshall JBriggeman I will agree with you that no pure figures exist in history, and that it's not fair to take partial ugliness

adamgurri	707977585603563520	2016-03-10T17:13:04	hangingnoodles I agree that the stability in physics is key. The point is being able to establish something like that---e.g., what

adamgurri	707975173639688192	2016-03-10T17:03:29	hangingnoodles I agree that social sciences shouldn't be treated like physics. But the Q of "are these situations equivalent" matters.
adamgurri	707975037278617601	2016-03-10T17:02:57	hangingnoodles The questions are whether and when that matters. E.g. are certain patterns stable enough to generalize about.
adamgurri	707974889026797573	2016-03-10T17:02:21	hangingnoodles The point is that the elements constitutive of a given identity are not stable over time.

adamgurri	707232801914032128	2016-03-08T15:53:34	daveliakos I'm probably going to read some secondary stuff on Kant and Hegel's aesthetics at some point to help illuminate it.
adamgurri	707232651334328322	2016-03-08T15:52:58	daveliakos Yeah, the first third or so of T&amp;M on that subject is still beyond my grasp.

adamgurri	707230998497464321	2016-03-08T15:46:24	daveliakos I've resigned myself to a long journey attempting to understand both rather than one or the other.
adamgurri	707230770398687233	2016-03-08T15:45:30	daveliakos When I got to the section of B&amp;T where Heidegger spoke of "fore-havings" I was like GADAMER! I FOUND YOU!
adamgurri	707229796854579200	2016-03-08T15:41:37	daveliakos Thankfully, Gadamer does not indulge in the weird stylistic choices though.
adamgurri	707229651589062657	2016-03-08T15:41:03	daveliakos Yes, that's what I concluded. And I take Gadamer seriously, sooooooo....

adamgurri	707227582438240256	2016-03-08T15:32:49	I do think there's something there, at least something worth understanding.
adamgurri	707227507662184448	2016-03-08T15:32:32	Anyway that's my current uncomfortable relationship with Heidegger's philosophy. I find it interesting in spite of myself.

adamgurri	707226654159060993	2016-03-08T15:29:08	George Steiner said the wordplay is actually quite compelling in German, though. He said it belongs to the history of lit as much as phil.
adamgurri	707226487980736512	2016-03-08T15:28:29	I do think his style is terrible, and his argument that it was necessary to get outside of the assumptions baked in common language is BS.
adamgurri	707226278844342276	2016-03-08T15:27:39	"The Origin of the Work of Art" is a great essay, and "The Thinker as Poet" a great philosophical poem.
adamgurri	707226172841656321	2016-03-08T15:27:13	I tried reading Being and Time and did not understand; all I know of it I know from other writers talking about its concepts.
adamgurri	707226031590150144	2016-03-08T15:26:40	made me wonder if there was some value to Heidegger's philosophy in spite of his style and his evil choice.
adamgurri	707225772667375616	2016-03-08T15:25:38	Reading, and being swept up by, Gadamer---Heidegger's student, who had the virtue of NEVER having been a Nazi (and shunning H when he was);
adamgurri	707225600604372997	2016-03-08T15:24:57	For a long time I simply dismissed Heidegger as the Nazi philosopher and the father of postmodernism.

adamgurri	707224761114484739	2016-03-08T15:21:37	kev_jg MeadBadger I felt that way for a very long time. McCloskey on rhetoric made me doubt it. I'm sure there are whole BS fields;
adamgurri	707223779219476480	2016-03-08T15:17:43	kev_jg I read MeadBadger as saying some social theory renders you unintelligible by design; I simply don't agree. All theory has its BSers
adamgurri	707223016489533440	2016-03-08T15:14:41	hangingnoodles Sarah_Bakewell My attempt to read Being and Time was a bust. Its meaning remained...concealed....

adamgurri	704407028626804736	2016-02-29T20:44:57	I've read webcomics since I was...12 or 13, perhaps. Sporadic updates and burning out have always been a characteristic of them.
adamgurri	704406798464323585	2016-02-29T20:44:02	I'm the indirect beneficiary of Patreon; I read webcomics on ad supported sites that nowadays go to Patreon patrons before going public.

adamgurri	704404924864589825	2016-02-29T20:36:35	tobym Yes fair point, the centralized market aspect of it can't hurt.
adamgurri	704404665551687680	2016-02-29T20:35:34	I've just seen more and more webcomic artists and writers and such who make decent supplemental income this way.

adamgurri	704404246326861824	2016-02-29T20:33:54	OddLane continue to be somewhat prolific. Kickstarter is a fight to drum up support for each and every project sort of scenario.
adamgurri	704404160343633920	2016-02-29T20:33:33	OddLane Obviously you can lose patrons but once you've built up a following the default is sort of in the creator's favor, so long as they
adamgurri	704404044421398528	2016-02-29T20:33:06	OddLane It sets a baseline for how much some creators can make if they actually produce works regularly.
adamgurri	704403715009212416	2016-02-29T20:31:47	Perhaps it's the ease of tiered rewarding, or the familiarity with Kickstarter, or the social aspect. Who knows?
adamgurri	704403606607372288	2016-02-29T20:31:21	Paypal has made recurring payments pretty easy for ages at this point. But somehow "Kickstarter, but for recurring payments" gets it done.

adamgurri	697852877449121792	2016-02-11T18:41:06	DrewFitzAndrew yeah this was me muddling into something unintentionally
adamgurri	697851962642075648	2016-02-11T18:37:28	DrewFitzAndrew hmm I think I took it too far without meaning to.
adamgurri	697851691044048896	2016-02-11T18:36:23	DrewFitzAndrew Yup that works now. And yeah.
adamgurri	697851280874676224	2016-02-11T18:34:45	DrewFitzAndrew But now that you put it that way, I do think the paper defends _methodological_ non-supervenience, not ontological.

adamgurri	697169418829303812	2016-02-09T21:25:16	@PoliteHunk But I do think it's precisely in all the things we care about (such as politics) that we see the limits of stats.

adamgurri	686607183497326592	2016-01-11T17:54:43	JasonKuznicki From what I understand, an Aristotelian would say that the initial setup points towards the emergent order as a final cause.

adamgurri	686606859705413637	2016-01-11T17:53:26	FriedrichHayek HA! jinx. But I couldn't find anything where he writes about the two at once.

adamgurri	686605518954205184	2016-01-11T17:48:06	JasonKuznicki If you just think about emergent order as discovery processes, what are they discovering? Seems natural to put a final cause
adamgurri	686605417078722565	2016-01-11T17:47:42	JasonKuznicki But it seems like there is nevertheless a reasonable connection that could be made here, or a synthesis at least.

adamgurri	685159808945754112	2016-01-07T18:03:22	DrewFitzAndrew @Celt_Englishman I think group decisions are real but contractarianism doesn't cover it.
adamgurri	685159752092008449	2016-01-07T18:03:09	DrewFitzAndrew @Celt_Englishman Therefore, the idea of decisions as a group were invalidated, QED.
adamgurri	685159678620348416	2016-01-07T18:02:51	DrewFitzAndrew What @Celt_Englishman is getting at in terms of contract, then eventually people noticed there aren't any actual contracts.
adamgurri	685159566045089792	2016-01-07T18:02:24	DrewFitzAndrew @Celt_Englishman I think contractarianism is where it started going wrong---first philosophers tried to talk about

adamgurri	685159384826130433	2016-01-07T18:01:41	DrewFitzAndrew @Celt_Englishman IMO I think the HOA convenant or any sort of social contract is a bad model for how this mostly works.
