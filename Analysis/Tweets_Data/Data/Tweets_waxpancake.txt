waxpancake	702673326703902720	2016-02-25T01:55:50	joshmillard scumbly Ha, I saw that thread earlier today but didn't realize I'd posted it.
waxpancake	702673017705369600	2016-02-25T01:54:37	bertrandom Yeah, I saw it, but I thought it was already a well-told story after the excavation ordeal in 2014. Warshaw's done so much more.
waxpancake	702595231158394880	2016-02-24T20:45:31	Shnabubula Yeah, I thought about including it, but it doesn't make sense without the subtitles for non-French speakers.
waxpancake	702579486647169025	2016-02-24T19:42:57	Sadly, there's no Gopher client for Chrome, so you have to use a proxy. More information on GopherFilter here:

waxpancake	702576073721016320	2016-02-24T19:29:23	mathowie If it was just passing mentions or references, there would be thousands of songs.
waxpancake	702575993618182144	2016-02-24T19:29:04	mathowie No, they have to substantially be about Twitter, in either the song name, chorus, or discussed in the lyrics.
waxpancake	702575323041259520	2016-02-24T19:26:24	I made a companion playlist of only good songs about Twitter. 
waxpancake	702573484040278016	2016-02-24T19:19:06	I made a playlist of songs about Twitter. I'm so, so sorry. 
waxpancake	702565787236577280	2016-02-24T18:48:31	q0rtz It does seem useful to incorporate and get banking/taxes set up‚Äînone of that's HARD but it's confusing/time-consuming the first time.
waxpancake	702564467356217344	2016-02-24T18:43:16	q0rtz Yeah, all good points. I'd love the option to incorporate locally, but it seems like this is mostly for international businesses
waxpancake	702556316720455680	2016-02-24T18:10:53	q0rtz whyyyy
waxpancake	702551277020905473	2016-02-24T17:50:51	This looks pretty damned useful for indie businesses. I've wanted something like this for YEARS.

waxpancake	702263140277288960	2016-02-23T22:45:54	bfod turnislefthome Yeah, it had chunky cartoony physics that just felt bouncy and fun. Cars squished flat, drifted all over.
waxpancake	702249764331474944	2016-02-23T21:52:45	turnislefthome Yep, it's like a 3D, multiplayer version of Micro Machines. Go find a copy! It's incredibly fun, good level design.
waxpancake	702245733798322176	2016-02-23T21:36:44	mjsreader Wow, thanks. I'll add supporting links when I get back to my computer.

waxpancake	701560548417089536	2016-02-22T00:14:03	jzy No... But I haven't played Dark Souls, so not sure it'd be too exciting for me. I know it's a very, very hard game.
waxpancake	701557679123083264	2016-02-22T00:02:39	This new world record 100% speedrun of The Witness in 2:49:52 is pretty great. Spoilers upon spoilers. 
waxpancake	701550913102589952	2016-02-21T23:35:46	davidburn Totally. The ad industry is great at pulling in talented, creative people of all kinds to help sell the stuff their clients make.

waxpancake	701476165756653568	2016-02-21T18:38:45	bfod No idea, but here's another variation. 
waxpancake	701234612949770240	2016-02-21T02:38:54	davidburn "People who make stuff" is a pretty broad demographic, no? Every writer, coder, musician, filmmaker, game designer, illustrator‚Ä¶
waxpancake	701215321328214016	2016-02-21T01:22:15	ashadornfest Lots of nomads these days living in multiple cities, maybe.
waxpancake	701214140149305345	2016-02-21T01:17:33	davidburn I have no disdain at all for marketing‚Äîit's incredibly valuable. But it's not what the festival is about or who it was made for.
waxpancake	701191594943184897	2016-02-20T23:47:58	davidburn We have a limited number of seats and give priority to artists/makers/hackers over marketing/bizdev/strategists. It's no secret.

waxpancake	701180956514758656	2016-02-20T23:05:42	mfmakichen Yeah, I think you're right. It's more addressing issues of harassment in the creative community.
waxpancake	701180816076832769	2016-02-20T23:05:08	davidburn mfmakichen That's exactly right, except it's not, and has never been, invite-only.

waxpancake	700033242435457024	2016-02-17T19:05:05	Yes, promoting scammy products is bad. But I think deleting a kid's 1M+ follower Tumblr without warning or recourse is tone-deaf, at best.
waxpancake	700032535699435520	2016-02-17T19:02:17	I keep thinking about that New Republic article, and how every shitty thing that Tumblr does in it takes place a year after Yahoo bought it.

waxpancake	684460698810753024	2016-01-05T19:45:21	alexpalex Go on.

waxpancake	684448829492482048	2016-01-05T18:58:12	_sMallard That's definitely an opinion!
waxpancake	684445738596577280	2016-01-05T18:45:55	gregmaletic Naah, same problem. Facebook allows 64k of text in an update, I'd guess most are under 200 characters.
waxpancake	684443070130081792	2016-01-05T18:35:18	ohhoe I have that all the time, also related to anxiety. I force myself to eat by the clock.
waxpancake	684442270729240576	2016-01-05T18:32:08	ohhoe Absolutely. For me, it's compounded by alcohol, not eating, or eating too heavy.
waxpancake	684441714627497984	2016-01-05T18:29:55	gregmaletic You just wrote three tweets to reply. I think that's 99% of what it replaces.

waxpancake	684440176756568064	2016-01-05T18:23:49	_sMallard Interesting people will tweet interesting things, regardless of length.
waxpancake	684439648886722560	2016-01-05T18:21:43	Frankly, I welcome the death of the tweetstorm, and Twitlonger hacks, and walls of text in images. 140 characters and a "read more" link? üëç
waxpancake	684437179582418944	2016-01-05T18:11:54	willsmith And inaccessible to the blind, too.
waxpancake	684435914504798209	2016-01-05T18:06:52	willsmith I think it'd beat tweetstorms, the incredibly obnoxious and hard-to-follow workaround for this limitation.
waxpancake	684435081771917312	2016-01-05T18:03:34	Twitter is a place where I can talk to anyone and they can talk to me, for better or worse, rather than being relegated to an Other Inbox.
waxpancake	684434666628100096	2016-01-05T18:01:55	Twitter is a place for public self-expression, searchable and embeddable on the web, from people I'm interested in‚Äînot just people I know.
