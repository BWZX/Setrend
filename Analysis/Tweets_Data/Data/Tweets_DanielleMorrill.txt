DanielleMorrill	722288963243773952	2016-04-19T05:01:22	brettnorthart Grubhub Sprig maybe time to give it another try
DanielleMorrill	722288566135496704	2016-04-19T04:59:48	10) the only on-demand service where I am the vendor is Getaround and that's working out super well so far!
DanielleMorrill	722288399525105664	2016-04-19T04:59:08	9) and often I'll order a Lyft because it's less popular, so response times are better
DanielleMorrill	722288233808138243	2016-04-19T04:58:29	8) on the other hand Instacart is such a big part of my life I've been asked to cut back a bit
DanielleMorrill	722288072805654529	2016-04-19T04:57:50	7) Postmates is so expensive, I only order it if I am sick or drunk
DanielleMorrill	722287878974230529	2016-04-19T04:57:04	6) for food delivery I'm still all about Grubhub and have been for years! Find Sprig meh for the price, never tried Uber Eats
DanielleMorrill	722287586257936384	2016-04-19T04:55:54	5) Uber made my neighborhood choices acceptable (2011)
DanielleMorrill	722287428514422785	2016-04-19T04:55:17	4) the next one I remember was Uber, because they were a twilio SMS customer, and I like bourgeois things!
DanielleMorrill	722287192739958786	2016-04-19T04:54:20	3) I have spent money on TaskRabbit in the past 72 hours for the office, and before Mattermark we used them at twilio for groceries
DanielleMorrill	722287009411104768	2016-04-19T04:53:37	2) the most important and 1st on-demand crowd sourced service I ever used was TaskRabbit
DanielleMorrill	722286861729660928	2016-04-19T04:53:01	1) My husband just walked to get our burritos, this is a tweetstorm about "on demand services"

DanielleMorrill	715984515018133504	2016-04-01T19:29:45	DanielleMorrill Have them read book "High Tech Ventures" , then apply methods to 4 current cases.
DanielleMorrill	715984623701004289	2016-04-01T19:30:11	DanielleMorrill 1) Well I'm one of those super-young VCs needing tips... but I'd say to immerse oneself in their local startup ecosystem
DanielleMorrill	715987148869091328	2016-04-01T19:40:13	MrMeritology which book?
DanielleMorrill	715986965489799168	2016-04-01T19:39:29	hugs you have the BEST Twitter handle btw
DanielleMorrill	715985525958684672	2016-04-01T19:33:46	Have them study Major League Baseball stats to verify if investing in home run leaders is the only winning strategy. 
DanielleMorrill	715981961089691648	2016-04-01T19:19:36	8) I wonder if I could teach a class kind of like our HBS case on Mattermark but for VC associates, with all real data... bussgang?
DanielleMorrill	715981471312273408	2016-04-01T19:17:39	_PeterT_ I think this could be fun! Do you have any tips?
DanielleMorrill	715981187773116416	2016-04-01T19:16:32	7) getting a lot of replies that VC associates need to go work at a startup, but what if they've already done that? What else?
DanielleMorrill	715980932625338368	2016-04-01T19:15:31	6) at Mattermark we call this "professional hygiene" and I tend to teach it to the really young recruits
DanielleMorrill	715980719009300481	2016-04-01T19:14:40	5) this was all numbers stuff, but maybe some basic email and calendar etiquette should go on the list? vchomework
DanielleMorrill	715979534663684096	2016-04-01T19:09:57	DanielleMorrill first start your own business so you really know what it's actually all about and it's not just a numbers game
DanielleMorrill	715980466868854784	2016-04-01T19:13:40	naynerz what for?
DanielleMorrill	715979848519430144	2016-04-01T19:11:12	DanielleMorrill start a business instead. More founder VCs!
DanielleMorrill	715980381527285760	2016-04-01T19:13:19	4) taking the financials of a startup that recently IPO'd, like Hubspot, and playing out how you'd decide to invest early on w/ less info
DanielleMorrill	715979960263905281	2016-04-01T19:11:39	3) #1 for me would be to build out a SaaS metrics spreadsheet with real historical data from a portfolio company, then build sales model
DanielleMorrill	715979480590712832	2016-04-01T19:09:45	2) I want to know what other VCs think, what's the associate "curriculum" like?
DanielleMorrill	715979265934659584	2016-04-01T19:08:53	1) founders, if you could give VC associates "homework" to make them better up and coming VCs what would you suggest?

DanielleMorrill	710937979942907904	2016-03-18T21:16:37	imkialikethecar hunterwalk I tend to overpay kids right out of school and then just push them insanely hard to grow into it fast
DanielleMorrill	710937765878206464	2016-03-18T21:15:46	imkialikethecar hunterwalk totally agree they are there, just quite a struggle for employees
DanielleMorrill	710937654590738433	2016-03-18T21:15:20	imkialikethecar hunterwalk oh I just was referring to the point where they start to get into more comfortable territory

DanielleMorrill	710936777876353024	2016-03-18T21:11:51	imkialikethecar hunterwalk for context I moved here in year 4 of my career, made 60k in a marketing job that first year
DanielleMorrill	710936558057029632	2016-03-18T21:10:58	imkialikethecar hunterwalk yeah those are usually starting at 5+ years experience and $80k salary or more, so many people competing
DanielleMorrill	710935840961093632	2016-03-18T21:08:07	imkialikethecar hunterwalk thankful I spent first 4 years of my career elsewhere with much lower cost of living
DanielleMorrill	710935677441937408	2016-03-18T21:07:28	imkialikethecar hunterwalk right, for people only able to do entry level work that pays $30k I don't think the Bay Area is a good choice
DanielleMorrill	710935425704026112	2016-03-18T21:06:28	brettnorthart this is a momentary lull before 1) interest rates 2) Trump 3) China/Brazil/Russia

DanielleMorrill	710934643806068736	2016-03-18T21:03:22	imkialikethecar hunterwalk true, and some work is not worth more than $30k because so many people could do it

DanielleMorrill	710918773939658752	2016-03-18T20:00:18	hunterwalk yeah, sales starts at $24/hour ($50k base) so maybe slightly higher
DanielleMorrill	710918142730440705	2016-03-18T19:57:48	aapltwits hunterwalk hopefully they won't be trading off any cash comp for the stock
DanielleMorrill	710917998584811520	2016-03-18T19:57:13	hunterwalk difference is probably long term upward progression vs. long term retaining workforce. Makes sense
DanielleMorrill	710917834893713408	2016-03-18T19:56:34	hunterwalk it's interesting, not sure what those folks make per hour but probably similar to entry level other jobs at startups?
DanielleMorrill	710917645919358976	2016-03-18T19:55:49	hunterwalk oh cool, well good for them (I hope!)
DanielleMorrill	710913935151468545	2016-03-18T19:41:04	lesamitchell oh I see, is it actually good for them or will it be used to justify super low pay?

DanielleMorrill	698915461895888896	2016-02-14T17:03:25	hunterwalk there is definitely some middle road where founders think through things. Agree interest rates on notes is the wrong thing tho
DanielleMorrill	698915196903956480	2016-02-14T17:02:22	hunterwalk fair, but "forecastable outcome" like next milestones seems desirable

DanielleMorrill	698909553287507968	2016-02-14T16:39:57	alexiskold msuster e.g. I think in SaaS you will see huge push to net negative annual churn rates as a bar

DanielleMorrill	696949570291503104	2016-02-09T06:51:40	Fundraising is a full time job for the CEO, and it will be tempting to do other stuff you shouldn't do.

DanielleMorrill	696943443889819648	2016-02-09T06:27:20	semil I really hope so, the evolution of seed stage is my favorite part of this market!
DanielleMorrill	696943173713657856	2016-02-09T06:26:15	From term sheet to close can take months if you have a lot of investors, a lot of revenue and/or customer contracts, and doing own finance.
DanielleMorrill	696942943819730944	2016-02-09T06:25:21	If you have never done due diligence ask your lawyer for the checklist now and start working on it. It is a lot of work, can stall process.
DanielleMorrill	696942696523554816	2016-02-09T06:24:22	If you have not modeled out what converting your notes will look like in different scenarios, any good startup lawyer can help.
DanielleMorrill	696942393598308352	2016-02-09T06:23:09	semil this is the real mess coming, $1B of debt in our ecosystem that's gonna go *poof* if not converted, poison angel investing for years
DanielleMorrill	696941806228008960	2016-02-09T06:20:49	semil i think most people never model conversion til they have a term sheet and the lawyer makes the model
DanielleMorrill	696941584269647872	2016-02-09T06:19:56	semil yes, I would
DanielleMorrill	696941112766951424	2016-02-09T06:18:04	If you have a convertible note hanging out there, convert it ASAP. Your cap is likely in play. Caps aren't prices, they're discounts.
DanielleMorrill	696940616442363904	2016-02-09T06:16:06	Interestingly, low valuations can also mean smaller rounds and more of them. But also more doubling down on existing portfolio companies
DanielleMorrill	696940408870408193	2016-02-09T06:15:16	There is a LOT of capital out there that investors are required to deploy, they can't stall forever.
