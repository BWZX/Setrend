awallenstein	684093271421788160	2016-01-04T19:25:20	Good Q. After much hunting/pecking, I found a 'Watch Community' tab in Yahoo's TV section  
awallenstein	684091091512078336	2016-01-04T19:16:40	RIP. Gave us Community season 6, at least. And an annoyingly-designed repository for old SNL clips.  
awallenstein	684090393470697472	2016-01-04T19:13:54	Yahoo, w/ no relevant mobile presence, now pulls back on video efforts too -&gt; areas consumers are most excited about 
awallenstein	684089153705787392	2016-01-04T19:08:58	"Um, hey gang, where did Yahoo Screen go!?"  
awallenstein	684088120971759616	2016-01-04T19:04:52	On a personal note, i actually used to use Yahoo Screen. Watching the latest episode of 'SNL' the morning after a show was easier than NBC
awallenstein	684088048146079744	2016-01-04T19:04:35	Not entirely a shocker, as Yahoo is clearly in retrenchment mode on the entertainment front as the company explores selling core business
awallenstein	684087616283766786	2016-01-04T19:02:52	Whatever video efforts haven't already been pulled back are being moved over to sit with Yahoo's digital magazines
awallenstein	684087363660869632	2016-01-04T19:01:51	Yahoo Screen was the company's destination for all its many video initiatives: Community, NFL telecast, SNL clips, Katie Couric, etc.

awallenstein	682987397408288773	2016-01-01T18:10:59	Feel cleansed to have gotten the list out of my system. Happy New Year!
awallenstein	682987227761242112	2016-01-01T18:10:19	Honorable mentions: Girls, Silicon Valley, Narcos, Last Man on Earth
awallenstein	682986714491711488	2016-01-01T18:08:16	1. TheLeftovers (HBO). One stunning ep. after another; no TV show has ever made riskier moves that paid off. Theroux needs Best Actor nom
awallenstein	682986494844362753	2016-01-01T18:07:24	And for my No. 1 TV show of 2015 &lt;drumroll&gt;....
awallenstein	682985744634384384	2016-01-01T18:04:25	2. Transparent (Amazon). Amazed last year's Rookie of the Year came back stronger, stranger, bolder. Rest of ensemble caught up to Tambor
awallenstein	682985228491714560	2016-01-01T18:02:22	3. TheWalkingDead (AMC). My reigning favorite's first half of the season was far better than the second half but still potent w/o A game
awallenstein	682984826098593792	2016-01-01T18:00:46	4. InsideAmySchumer (Comedy Central). Brilliant as ever, sketches merit repeat viewing. Latecomers, go back to S1, it was just as brilliant
awallenstein	682984521629831174	2016-01-01T17:59:33	5. Homeland (Showtime). Not best season, but still quite good. Ripped from headlines fresh enough to give you a paper cut. Gonna miss Quinn
awallenstein	682984151201529856	2016-01-01T17:58:05	6. Togetherness (HBO). Best new show of 2015; Duplass bros. may be better at TV than movies. Great dramedy mix, strong ensemble
awallenstein	682983360596152320	2016-01-01T17:54:57	7. Humans (AMC). Incredibly bad finale episode obscures what was a great ride 9/10ths of the way. Closest thing to Black Mirror out there.
awallenstein	682982663548989440	2016-01-01T17:52:10	8. Tyrant (FX). Most underrated guilty pleasure on TV. Think Homeland meets Empire. Got better than a very uneven but promising 1st season
awallenstein	682982045493125120	2016-01-01T17:49:43	9. DifficultPeople (Hulu). Closest thing we have to Seinfeld on TV right now, but more profane. Have a feeling its popularity will grow
awallenstein	682981230929920005	2016-01-01T17:46:29	10. TheKnick (Cinemax). Not as good as season 1, when it was in my top 3, but still compelling. Best set and costume design on TV.
