Cimmerian999	711978870858076161	2016-03-21T18:12:45	.anatadmati erikbryn It's that you quote obvious ones and then the rest just seem to follow. Hence that slope thing. Thanks for example.
Cimmerian999	711978590003277825	2016-03-21T18:11:38	.anatadmati erikbryn My quite obvious point was not that there aren't externalities that need to be dealt with.

Cimmerian999	711931053812809728	2016-03-21T15:02:44	.tedfrank Exactly right. Socializing the cost makes controlling others "optimal" even necessary. And they say there's no slippery slope...

Cimmerian999	683336249856229376	2016-01-02T17:17:12	davealevine pmarca nntaleb Well I may have read some of his work...
Cimmerian999	683330668579835904	2016-01-02T16:55:01	davealevine pmarca I think reducing these situations much more realistic and important than trying to make bad things happen less.
Cimmerian999	683330506012753920	2016-01-02T16:54:22	davealevine pmarca Much less severe when a problem happens - but people knew there was some risk in advance.
Cimmerian999	683330175564578817	2016-01-02T16:53:04	davealevine pmarca I think we had and have too many things that get to pretend they're riskless but aren't. Eg, money markets.
Cimmerian999	683325941406240768	2016-01-02T16:36:14	davealevine pmarca Yes, while I don't think answer is government control, this is a much bigger problem then knowing evil genius villains.
Cimmerian999	683316621469876225	2016-01-02T15:59:12	davealevine pmarca Wrong &lt;&gt; knowing and evil.
Cimmerian999	683316502913667072	2016-01-02T15:58:44	davealevine pmarca Yes. I was one of those saying it in 2000 (not 2007). I don't think "everyone else knew it" just that they were wrong.
Cimmerian999	683312729398972416	2016-01-02T15:43:44	.pmarca Notion they collectively saw it patently ridiculous. ALWAYS some predicting crisis; anecdotes a meaningless search for villains.
Cimmerian999	683249134866833408	2016-01-02T11:31:02	The case that financial executives did not see the 2007-2008 financial crisis coming (which I very much believe).

Cimmerian999	682957569665585152	2016-01-01T16:12:28	The former economist never points out how ineffective money seems to be at getting what it wants. Odd.
