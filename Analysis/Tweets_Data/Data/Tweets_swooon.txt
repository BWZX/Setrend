swooon	687823655477342215	2016-01-15T02:28:33	BootymanNYC Your original comment on social media is just mean (sarcastic) and won't inspire anything just anger
swooon	687706010228789249	2016-01-14T18:41:04	BootymanNYC k thank you
swooon	687705570179198977	2016-01-14T18:39:19	BootymanNYC  Dude. I said I respectfully disagree I just don't wanna argue.
swooon	687704110985011200	2016-01-14T18:33:31	BootymanNYC Whatever. I respectfully disagree with you
swooon	687702800839630848	2016-01-14T18:28:19	BootymanNYC that's exactly what you did to me though. " Happy about your watch? Well, you need to be cured"
swooon	687702630714454018	2016-01-14T18:27:38	BootymanNYC avatar, how can you know why I took a picture of a watch? How can you know
swooon	687702507238387712	2016-01-14T18:27:09	BootymanNYC so maybe a picture of my watch was to honor my appreciation. Maybe it wasn't. Just like I don't know why you picked that
swooon	687702251570360320	2016-01-14T18:26:08	BootymanNYC first of all, to assume somebody else needs to be cured, is ridiculous and delusional. Secondly, to assume you can say that?
swooon	687701813143965697	2016-01-14T18:24:23	BootymanNYC if I say nice avatar will you use that compliment to keep looking for good avatars? Or just be appreciative? That's your choice
swooon	687701184031911937	2016-01-14T18:21:53	BootymanNYC compliments are bad enablers. But that isn't true. The receiver of the compliment needs to choose
swooon	687700983980404736	2016-01-14T18:21:06	BootymanNYC it's my choice whether I use a compliment as fuel for more or just appreciate the compliment and move on. With your logic
swooon	687700172940414976	2016-01-14T18:17:52	BootymanNYC sarcasm doesn't help anybody. If you are in fact here to help

swooon	687699895256510464	2016-01-14T18:16:46	BootymanNYC in the future,invalidating somebody else's feeling isn't very  about "nice watch.Would u like my advice"
swooon	687696856462323713	2016-01-14T18:04:42	BootymanNYC k_ved ok thanks for the advice
