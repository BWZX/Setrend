PAntompietri	726180099058487296	2016-04-29T22:43:22	baysieblue I read that the part in Snatch where that’s negotiated was a ref back to Lock Stock: folks said the accents were too strong.
PAntompietri	726178293578354689	2016-04-29T22:36:11	Then see Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.

PAntompietri	722225356904783876	2016-04-19T00:48:38	hriob_zagel I don’t doubt it at all. But the whole point of his books is that risk is unlimited. Which is both true &amp; irrelevant.

PAntompietri	722221812021641216	2016-04-19T00:34:32	hriob_zagel The whole point of the book is not to short vol. He’s right, most people who don’t take the time to study will lose at it.
