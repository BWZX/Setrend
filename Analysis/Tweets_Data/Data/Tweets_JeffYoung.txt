JeffYoung	697958297954054144	2016-02-12T01:40:00	jasongurwin So if you can an insurer for a quote, it may not be for the exact same policy they sell on the exchange.
JeffYoung	697958170635931648	2016-02-12T01:39:29	jasongurwin Insurers also can only sell on the exchange or only off the exchange.
JeffYoung	697958092995227649	2016-02-12T01:39:11	jasongurwin Insurers can, however, sell policies outside the exchange that are different from those on the exchange.
JeffYoung	697957921053937665	2016-02-12T01:38:30	jasongurwin No. Rating rules require prices to be the same for everyone, only adjusted for age, geography, and family size.

JeffYoung	697957239320092672	2016-02-12T01:35:47	jasongurwin In theory, running your own exchange gives a state more control over their insurance markets.
