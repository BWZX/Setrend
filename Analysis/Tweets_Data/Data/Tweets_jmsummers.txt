jmsummers	689506910484193281	2016-01-19T17:57:12	Which is to say, Sanders will have to hustle like he's never hustled before.
jmsummers	689506733107060736	2016-01-19T17:56:30	In fact, if Obama was a little weaker‚Äîor the Clintons less resentful‚ÄîHRC could have picked up modest plurality and won primary.
jmsummers	689506568413540352	2016-01-19T17:55:50	Take away any of that, and HRC doesn't necessarily lose black voters, or lose them by the margin she did.
jmsummers	689506480194715648	2016-01-19T17:55:29	...emphasizing the symbolism of his run in black spaces, and *then* winning white voters and therefore showing his viability.
jmsummers	689506262216773632	2016-01-19T17:54:37	But this will be really hard. Again, Obama only managed by out-hustling HRC on the retail side, persuading black leaders...
jmsummers	689505676838703106	2016-01-19T17:52:18	Sanders can breach it! But it will take dedicated effort, specialized appeals, and missteps by Clinton, a la 2008.
jmsummers	689505649638690821	2016-01-19T17:52:11	When you consider too that blacks tend to be stalwart voters‚Äîthey tend to stick to the Democrats they know‚Äîit adds up a firewall for HRC.
jmsummers	689505556747423744	2016-01-19T17:51:49	The second piece is retail politics. Clintons are excellent at retail politics in black spaces. Builds familiarity and trust.
jmsummers	689505484085293056	2016-01-19T17:51:32	Not to say that blacks only care about symbolism. Far from it. But when mainstream tends to ignore and disdain, respect goes a long way.
jmsummers	689505218732515328	2016-01-19T17:50:29	(It's noteworthy that the one Democrat who overcame Clintons with blacks was himself a living symbol for black voters.)
jmsummers	689505152315719680	2016-01-19T17:50:13	...which is generally not the norm in American politics. It has insulated them somewhat from the problems of their policies.
jmsummers	689505066416508929	2016-01-19T17:49:52	Which is to say that Clintons have always made efforts to show public respect for black voters and black politics...
jmsummers	689504960996839424	2016-01-19T17:49:27	i.e., President Clinton sold it in part as a bill to help black families in crime-ridden neighborhoods. 
jmsummers	689504541608431616	2016-01-19T17:47:47	Even things like the push for a crime bill are tied to a familiarity with the contours of black politics.
jmsummers	689504231250907136	2016-01-19T17:46:33	On that same score‚Äîand this is important‚Äîthe Clintons have excelled at symbolic politics when it comes to black voters.
jmsummers	689504178041937920	2016-01-19T17:46:21	First, history. Clintons have long connection to black political establishment. Among leaders, they are a known, mostly trusted quantity.
jmsummers	689503954783342592	2016-01-19T17:45:27	(As always, all of this is a liable to revision and change. It is not a definitive take. Just a draft.)
jmsummers	689503864136007680	2016-01-19T17:45:06	So, here is my take on why HRC maintains a strong and durable lead with black voters despite her history and problems.

jmsummers	688007350297473025	2016-01-15T14:38:29	18. When the homie dexdigi's first piece ran, he got dragged, but the latimes left him out there to absorb that dragging by himself.
jmsummers	688007033908510721	2016-01-15T14:37:14	17. We've seen pubs want to weigh into issues about race and basically let their black writers operate without a net before.
jmsummers	688006795026141184	2016-01-15T14:36:17	16. ...and then ran a piece in which she was further eviscerated by a much stronger writer? Ugh. That's grimy af.
jmsummers	688006549458055169	2016-01-15T14:35:18	15. Editors are supposed to backstop writers, to protect us from ourselves. ELLEmagazine let ol' girl say some wild shit, get dragged...
jmsummers	688006170091601921	2016-01-15T14:33:48	14. You should read iSmashFizzle's piece, but now I'm thinking "damn: that's how ELLEmagazine does its writers?"
jmsummers	688005949420867584	2016-01-15T14:32:55	13. So then:  Chavers gets dragged all day...and then ELLEmagazine runs a (very good) takedown of said piece by Ashley Ford.
jmsummers	688005081875267588	2016-01-15T14:29:28	12. On so many levels, this was an editorial failing.
jmsummers	688005001294254080	2016-01-15T14:29:09	11. Or at least maybe steered back to a less-wacky place. There was no one for whom that piece made any antennae twitch.
jmsummers	688004613308583937	2016-01-15T14:27:36	10. Were there more brown people in the editorial process there (and who felt they could speak up), that piece mighta gotten killed.
jmsummers	688008220300951553	2016-01-15T14:41:56	A statement that applies to oh so many newsrooms. 
jmsummers	688003571179253761	2016-01-15T14:23:28	9. ELLEmagazine, figuratively + literally, needs more ppl. And this --- THIS disasterpiece right here --- is why diversity matters.
jmsummers	688002996572139520	2016-01-15T14:21:11	8. Taken altogether, the decision to run that piece feels like they were getting too familiar, when they hadn't earned the credibility.
jmsummers	688002492697808897	2016-01-15T14:19:11	7. It's like: when ELLEmagazine does wade into a discussion/show concern about WOC, this is how they decide to do it?
jmsummers	688001531589832704	2016-01-15T14:15:22	6. That it ran in ELLEmagazine of all places necessarily upped the WTF-ness of the backlash to it. Like, "since when do y'all care abt...?"
jmsummers	688000997575254016	2016-01-15T14:13:14	5. Chavers' piece was a bizarre, terribly argued mess, and it would have been no matter where it had run.
jmsummers	687999123635761152	2016-01-15T14:05:48	3. That takes time and a lot of patience  and a lot of crow-eating.
