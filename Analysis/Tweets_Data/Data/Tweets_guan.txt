guan	723297262714142720	2016-04-21T23:48:00	LaurenLaCapra I am bidding on this item later, fingers crossed!
guan	723296900015906816	2016-04-21T23:46:33	LaurenLaCapra I mean, if it‚Äôs truly an overlooked deal and maybe you are the only bidder, this stuff doesn‚Äôt matter much.
guan	723296774442594304	2016-04-21T23:46:03	LaurenLaCapra If you place the bid days in advance, you risk other bidders talking themselves into higher bids, and pay more.
guan	723296671237595141	2016-04-21T23:45:39	LaurenLaCapra Suppose you are willing to pay $1,000 and assume you are going to win‚Äîquestion is how much (&lt;$1,000) you will pay.
guan	723295960835756032	2016-04-21T23:42:49	LaurenLaCapra then talking themselves into bidding higher.
guan	723295924311724033	2016-04-21T23:42:41	LaurenLaCapra First mistake is they are bidding days before auction is closing. Second mistake is, they (esp. i***l) are bidding, losing,
guan	723295900890718208	2016-04-21T23:42:35	LaurenLaCapra You set an alarm.
guan	723295695411785729	2016-04-21T23:41:46	LaurenLaCapra I‚Äôm saying you should place a *single* bid of what you are willing to pay, 3 seconds before auction close.
guan	723295387101085700	2016-04-21T23:40:33	LaurenLaCapra The point is just that eBay is a second price auction, not first price.
guan	723295333778903040	2016-04-21T23:40:20	LaurenLaCapra I wouldn‚Äôt‚Äîthis is assuming I‚Äôm willing and able to pay that much ;-)
guan	723295097866059778	2016-04-21T23:39:24	LaurenLaCapra Suppose I really want something and bid $1 billion. What I end up paying is an increment over the second highest bidder.
guan	723294749193592832	2016-04-21T23:38:01	LaurenLaCapra (What you actually pay does depend on other bidders.)
guan	723294708546543616	2016-04-21T23:37:51	LaurenLaCapra The idea is to bid that amount at the very end. What you are willing to pay shouldn‚Äôt depend on others.
guan	723294344652939265	2016-04-21T23:36:24	LaurenLaCapra eBay and sellers like it that way. It is not good bidding practice.
guan	723294123634102272	2016-04-21T23:35:31	benharnett LaurenLaCapra Only bidding in last 5 seconds is also better for self-discipline: you are not tempted to do this yourself.
guan	723293733836480512	2016-04-21T23:33:58	LaurenLaCapra It‚Äôs endogenous. Multiple rounds of bidding gets people riled up, as they rationalize higher bids.
