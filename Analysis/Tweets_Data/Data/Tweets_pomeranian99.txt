pomeranian99	687452113794928644	2016-01-14T01:52:10	jkottke Heh heh. I think it'd be easier to go to this place I found:  I hour out of NYC in Jersey!

pomeranian99	687432189345165314	2016-01-14T00:33:00	headphonology trintran No, they're fully "no kids", though I totally understand and sympathize; it's about maintaining atmosphere.
pomeranian99	687387586424401920	2016-01-13T21:35:46	1raith Is it this place?  If so, it looks like a lot of new games, not the 80s classics, though

pomeranian99	687386464188022784	2016-01-13T21:31:18	1raith I think you're also right -- Jersey is likely a good place for this stuff.

pomeranian99	687382770490945538	2016-01-13T21:16:38	headphonology trintran Yeah, that's precisely right: The places with vintage stuff are all booze-oriented, aimed at adults.

pomeranian99	687381200235851776	2016-01-13T21:10:23	headphonology trintran We were down there a lot this summer! But they didn't seem to have many old-school 80s games; mostly modern ones.
pomeranian99	687376138960769025	2016-01-13T20:50:17	tiredboredblog It was part of what was so awesome about those places. They were, apart from the lackluster management, authority-free.
