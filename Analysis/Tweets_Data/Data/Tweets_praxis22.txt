praxis22	713776670424084480	2016-03-26T17:16:34	As such I will cast my lot with Steam and the likes of Gog, and  who have a vested interest in me as a profit center.

praxis22	713774771847102464	2016-03-26T17:09:01	The whole, "Windows everywhere" strategy makes much sense in light of that.
praxis22	713774292337618945	2016-03-26T17:07:07	Taken in that light, the screw up that was the launch of the Xbox One, from a gamer standpoint becomes more transparent as a land grab
praxis22	713773826706915328	2016-03-26T17:05:16	Going forward it looks like MSFT will try to assert more control of the platform with hopes of further monetising the platform.
praxis22	713773473798230018	2016-03-26T17:03:52	So it looks like it's windows 7 or bust gaming wise. At least if you value the current state of the Windows open platform.
praxis22	713773042158215169	2016-03-26T17:02:09	So while MSFT getting serious about gaming as a profit center is good in some senses, it does smack of less control for the end  user.
praxis22	713772526472658944	2016-03-26T17:00:06	It's the gamers and enthusiasts that get screwed by lack of choice and options, things that used to be a given on earlier releases.
praxis22	713772240513445888	2016-03-26T16:58:58	As such Windows 10 is actually a trojan horse. None of this is bad for ordinary users, "normals" in the jargon.
praxis22	713771690954719232	2016-03-26T16:56:47	As such they need the platform to succeed, even if they have to give it away to achieve the wider aim.
praxis22	713771417762996224	2016-03-26T16:55:41	MSFT realise they have dropped the ball on mobile and VR and the post PC world is an existential threat to the platform.
praxis22	713771103756398592	2016-03-26T16:54:27	I may have to blog about this later, but it's looking like Windows 10's ubiquity is just a cover for vendor Lock in.
