bbki2611	725933744205361152	2016-04-29T06:24:26	Huge resistance coming up in Silver, at around $18-$18.50. Still carrying half the long position from $14. Look to reload on dips to $16s.

bbki2611	725600681609011201	2016-04-28T08:20:58	mhewson_CMC unfortunately not. But i can guarantee that we'll be seeing those Greece headlines multiple times in the future
bbki2611	725584390730960896	2016-04-28T07:16:14	I've done it! My time machine works! 
bbki2611	725570422310342656	2016-04-28T06:20:43	Frances_Coppola Ah yes, Luton. For me Luton is like Marmite: i tried it once and instantly knew it wasn't for me.
bbki2611	725568591609876480	2016-04-28T06:13:27	There's also hidden option number 3: Don't play this game.  Many people are just not suited to it 
bbki2611	725561315297624064	2016-04-28T05:44:32	Central banks re QE, alternating: "It's not working. We must do more of it!" "It's not working. We must do less of it!"
bbki2611	725278016780251137	2016-04-27T10:58:48	UreshP Macroandchill shorting it may be the right trade. But timing is more important, and currently timing doesn't seem to be good

bbki2611	725239783522484224	2016-04-27T08:26:53	nicolatheron UreshP yes. 12 episodes so far, it's really good. Recommended
bbki2611	725233508969537536	2016-04-27T08:01:57	Oil fundamentals should really keep WTI price between $30-$50. But the market seems to still be very bearish so i wont be surprised by &gt;$50
bbki2611	725232770704904192	2016-04-27T07:59:01	Hubon Ch2Christo yeah. But he's still the 2nd best driver ever in my opinion (after Senna, obviously)
bbki2611	725232495424356352	2016-04-27T07:57:55	Grey hair / baldness twitter is the best twitter
bbki2611	725232340482580480	2016-04-27T07:57:18	Ankit_Tweets LadyFOHF Brenda_Kelly i'm a fan of baseball caps. They're cheap. (Ok, apart from the one i got with Schumacher's signature)
bbki2611	725231262848409601	2016-04-27T07:53:01	LadyFOHF Brenda_Kelly oh it's polished all right 
bbki2611	725230135906029568	2016-04-27T07:48:33	Brenda_Kelly LadyFOHF absolutely. And all the money i've saved over 15 years: no more haircuts at Toni &amp; Guy
bbki2611	725229824810311680	2016-04-27T07:47:19	Brenda_Kelly LadyFOHF "hair"... what's that?
bbki2611	725228892450082817	2016-04-27T07:43:36	Ch2Christo Hubon yeah he worked for Cosworth in the mid 90s. He designed Michael Schumacher's engine valves when he drove for Benetton
bbki2611	725227764618526720	2016-04-27T07:39:07	Hubon Ch2Christo as you can probably guess he's the smart one in the family lol
bbki2611	725227591171465216	2016-04-27T07:38:26	Hubon Ch2Christo no never. He always worked in the City of London for various investment banks. And before that he was an F1 engineer :-)
bbki2611	725223627449339904	2016-04-27T07:22:41	Hubon Ch2Christo my brother currently works at UBS zurich, in private wealth. Speaks very highly of the swiss and how well things work
bbki2611	725221414358372352	2016-04-27T07:13:53	Hubon Ch2Christo man, i need the sun and warm weather... :)
bbki2611	725220215705993216	2016-04-27T07:09:08	Hubon Ch2Christo my 2nd choice is Australia but that's too far away from greece (for family visits). So i'll settle for cyprus/barcelona
bbki2611	725219935857836032	2016-04-27T07:08:01	Hubon Ch2Christo i think the best country in the world is Norway. But because of the weather i'd never live there.
bbki2611	725219548421591040	2016-04-27T07:06:28	Ch2Christo Hubon a very good friend of mine lives in Barcelona for a few years now and he speaks very highly of it. Good city for a family
bbki2611	725218848383885312	2016-04-27T07:03:42	Hubon Ch2Christo costa i'm having the same thoughts. I dont want to go back to London. So for me it's either Cyprus or Spain (Barcelona)
bbki2611	725025483172225026	2016-04-26T18:15:20	Mostly because They are Citadel And you are not. 
bbki2611	724979299367923714	2016-04-26T15:11:49	That's probably the most bearish (and desperate) comment you'll ever hear from a govt official. Greece = bankrupt

bbki2611	723436759367839744	2016-04-22T09:02:18	Out of 1/2 of the silver long position for around +20% in 2 months. Will reload on a dip towards $16. Taking profits is prudent here imo.

bbki2611	723145696040357888	2016-04-21T13:45:43	bbki2611 as predicted.... back to unchanged on the day. Next buying level in the $16.30-16.40s

bbki2611	723033206447038464	2016-04-21T06:18:44	fxsnowball i got the Samsung 850 Evo. Not the fastest around but excellent for its price imho
bbki2611	723032705584214016	2016-04-21T06:16:44	fxsnowball i am still short EUR vs long NOK &amp; GBP, but tiny long EURUSD. Trying to keep relatively flat. Good luck mate
bbki2611	723032477040807936	2016-04-21T06:15:50	fxsnowball tough one... the market is once again discounting a very dovish bazooka-Mario. Risk is that it gets disappointed.
bbki2611	723032281930194944	2016-04-21T06:15:03	fxsnowball btw 4GB RAM extra &amp; SSD drive make a massive difference. Boot time used to be around 80 seconds... now down to 13! Insane
bbki2611	723032095614984192	2016-04-21T06:14:19	fxsnowball NICE! My upgrades will go to my wife's 2010 MacBook Pro when I get the new one, so it's not wasted money :)

bbki2611	723028421069168640	2016-04-21T05:59:43	bbki2611 Obviously the same applies for oil and spooz... fast money has been overwhelmingly short.
bbki2611	723028235819331584	2016-04-21T05:58:59	Overnight price action in Silver clearly shows that the market has been caught well short. Big resistance coming up at around $18 now.

bbki2611	707848834500718592	2016-03-10T08:41:27	A lot is expected from the ECB. Last time Mario disappointed, so R/R is still for more disappointment. Tiny long Euro going into the ECB.

bbki2611	707636350925840385	2016-03-09T18:37:07	JediEconomist i disagree with you on this one. The time to be bearish was at $100, $90, $80, even $50. Down here R/R looks mediocre.

bbki2611	707260142845300736	2016-03-08T17:42:12	TheBubbleBubble in that case you're just telling everyone that economies and assets undergo a cyclical boom/bust pattern. That's econ 101.

bbki2611	707228211336384512	2016-03-08T15:35:19	In rare occasions like now, I hold a (long) med term view in oil. I don’t think i could trade oil ST - I have deep respect for people who do

bbki2611	707203078068576257	2016-03-08T13:55:27	bbki2611 I mean, eventually he’s going to be right. But that whole warning thing doesn’t add any value. I can read that in an Econ 101 book
bbki2611	707202233516072960	2016-03-08T13:52:06	Bubble boy’s raison d’être is basically to warn people that economies are cyclical. “We will crash but I don’t know exactly when”.Thanks bro

bbki2611	684699524699402240	2016-01-06T11:34:22	Mahen23 @GalacticMacro Indeed. That was mainly because of the huge supply of ZIRP money. As rates rise this move should reverse imho.
bbki2611	684699144842297344	2016-01-06T11:32:51	Is the official US CPI data an accurate indicator of the annual cost of living increase?

bbki2611	684697865650843648	2016-01-06T11:27:46	The_Coskun i think we all know that official "inflation" is b*ll*x. I'm talking about the proper definition of inflation i.e. money supply
bbki2611	684696958154465282	2016-01-06T11:24:10	@GalacticMacro Ok fair enough? I guess that's what makes it a market. Yours at 4 :)

bbki2611	684692731332018176	2016-01-06T11:07:22	The classic TA danger: looking at a multi-decade chart without taking into account money/credit growth. For ST charts that's fine of course.
bbki2611	684690776358518784	2016-01-06T10:59:36	The_Coskun that would be the norm if money supply had been constant. $20 in 2000 are NOT the same as $20 in 2016!
bbki2611	684682398068518912	2016-01-06T10:26:19	If you've been short oil from way above, well done. If you're initiating shorts here however, you're asking for trouble imho. Very bad R/R
