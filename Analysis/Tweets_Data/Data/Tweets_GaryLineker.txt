GaryLineker	716598239529725952	2016-04-03T12:08:28	Leicester's owner giving everyone at the game a free beer and a doughnut. That's a hell of a round.
GaryLineker	716591546842406912	2016-04-03T11:41:53	It's getting close to squeaky bum time. From personal experience that can get very messy. Come on you Foxes!

GaryLineker	715933664924852229	2016-04-01T16:07:41	Another sign of bloody old age. I have no recollection of this.  
GaryLineker	715931217774964737	2016-04-01T15:57:58	I would not have been the slightest bit 'cool' had he really lost his passport. 
GaryLineker	715857795220914177	2016-04-01T11:06:13	The day before taking my boys to el Clasico harry_lineker decides to try and give me a heart‚Ä¶

GaryLineker	715818928627429377	2016-04-01T08:31:46	jonawils totally.
GaryLineker	715818437281517568	2016-04-01T08:29:49	jonawils actually the real problem is the minister of sport here has zero influence or power at the cabinet table.
GaryLineker	715817378232279041	2016-04-01T08:25:36	jonawils Has there ever been a good British minister of sport?
GaryLineker	715598845867069440	2016-03-31T17:57:14	I'd like to think GeorgeLineker harry_lineker LinekerTobias angus_lineker but I suspect not. 
GaryLineker	715598121787645952	2016-03-31T17:54:22	GaryLineker Fancy imagining false assumptions to the point of feeling sickened. That's a good use of a few seconds!
GaryLineker	715597065158582272	2016-03-31T17:50:10	No, at my own expense. Jeez! 
GaryLineker	715596383684804608	2016-03-31T17:47:27	JanAageFjortoft wouldn't dream of mentioning it üòâ
GaryLineker	715595655209754624	2016-03-31T17:44:33	Delivering a life-long promise this weekend. Taking my 4 sons to watch el Cl√°sico at the Camp Nou. Cannot wait! Visca el Bar√ßa

GaryLineker	715204836401287168	2016-03-30T15:51:35	Gary Neville has lost his job with Valencia. Always looked a brutally difficult first job. Sure he'll bounce back in the stand or studio.
GaryLineker	715161075050815488	2016-03-30T12:57:41	Can he do it on a cold, wet Tuesday night?  
GaryLineker	715098022020034562	2016-03-30T08:47:08	Wonderfully fitting that a man who gave so much to a club is remembered by so many.  
GaryLineker	714901787556376576	2016-03-29T19:47:23	What an astonishing story vardy7 's is. Now go easy and save a few for Leicester.
GaryLineker	714893509145325568	2016-03-29T19:14:29	C'est formidable. 
GaryLineker	714857752057786368	2016-03-29T16:52:24	Our anthonyfjoshua goalhangerfilms series starts on BBC3 tomorrow - here's a little taster for you:  
GaryLineker	714468959186206720	2016-03-28T15:07:28	Interesting that England's various captains are the ones whose places in the squad appear most vulnerable. Tough choices lie ahead for Roy.
GaryLineker	714449457929195520	2016-03-28T13:49:59	Get in! 
GaryLineker	714400922227580928	2016-03-28T10:37:07	Well that was close. 
GaryLineker	714040078763442176	2016-03-27T10:43:15	andygoldstein05 I'll leave humour to you. Your football tweets always have me in stitches.
GaryLineker	714038825283153920	2016-03-27T10:38:16	andygoldstein05 just as long as you're aware that you haven't got a clue üòâ
GaryLineker	714034278116491264	2016-03-27T10:20:12	andygoldstein05 learns from which? You?
GaryLineker	713863822277218304	2016-03-26T23:02:52	Congratulations to vardy7 on becoming the first LCFC player to score for ENG since GaryLineker in 1985 
GaryLineker	713845514597441536	2016-03-26T21:50:07	Football is a simple game where 22 players kick a ball around for 90 minutes and at the end Germany give away a 2 goal lead.
GaryLineker	713843885215248384	2016-03-26T21:43:39	Rather like the Premier League this season, England tonight led by Spurs and Leicester .
GaryLineker	713841955638288384	2016-03-26T21:35:59	England are completely and utterly outplaying Germany. A tweet I never thought I'd type.
GaryLineker	713839794107899904	2016-03-26T21:27:24	It's a long time since a Leicester player scored for England. Congratulations to Jamie Vardy.
GaryLineker	713836598396383232	2016-03-26T21:14:42	Wonderful goal from Harry Kane. Just need to sort out the central defence. Need Stones to realise his potential. Ball player there is vital.
GaryLineker	713827189356007424	2016-03-26T20:37:18	Real shame for Jack Butland. Hope it's not too serious.
GaryLineker	713824541718495232	2016-03-26T20:26:47	If England win the Euros I'll do the first MOTD of next season in my clothes.
GaryLineker	713823722831011840	2016-03-26T20:23:32	mrewanmurray now I know you're joking ;)
GaryLineker	713823332278345728	2016-03-26T20:21:59	mrewanmurray I know, but it's a long time since we've heard it.
GaryLineker	713822724389531651	2016-03-26T20:19:34	mrewanmurray it really isn't. Without belief there is no hope. Good group of young players.
GaryLineker	713822352451248128	2016-03-26T20:18:05	mrjohnofarrell or yours ;)
GaryLineker	713822031406567424	2016-03-26T20:16:49	After a period in the footballing doldrums, England will be very competitive over the next decade.
GaryLineker	713816836492632064	2016-03-26T19:56:10	Can't think of a worse England strip.
GaryLineker	713812689424949249	2016-03-26T19:39:41	Come on Tottenham!
GaryLineker	713647413114892289	2016-03-26T08:42:56	Apologies for my tweet about England's defence. It was not intended to be disrespectful or in the context it's been taken. Sorry my mistake.
GaryLineker	713546214302679041	2016-03-26T02:00:49	"Oh go on, have a little nibble." 
GaryLineker	713499697776836609	2016-03-25T22:55:58	Just saw PeoplePlacesThings and it's utterly superb. Emotive, powerful and funny. gough_denise 's performance is astonishing.
GaryLineker	713395759136317440	2016-03-25T16:02:57	MattISpurs DoctorT1992 mrdanwalker I don't believe in chocolate, only crisps.
GaryLineker	713394367663357953	2016-03-25T15:57:26	Why sorry? I'd be chuffed for him. 
GaryLineker	713393534448046081	2016-03-25T15:54:07	MattISpurs DoctorT1992 mrdanwalker I'm thrilled that prospect excites you.
GaryLineker	713382262478401537	2016-03-25T15:09:20	DoctorT1992 mrdanwalker not out of character. I'm openly an atheist.
GaryLineker	713339882706493440	2016-03-25T12:20:55	DoctorT1992 mrdanwalker why?
GaryLineker	713331528588267520	2016-03-25T11:47:44	Neither is the fella behind us. I reckon he's got ear envy. 
GaryLineker	713315637662248960	2016-03-25T10:44:35	mrdanwalker it's only marginally less absurd ;)
GaryLineker	713315427246546945	2016-03-25T10:43:45	jonoBLITZ may as well. It's no more ludicrous.
GaryLineker	713313265137401856	2016-03-25T10:35:09	Funny how we are so influenced by books written by humans thousands of years ago. Happy Easter, all.
GaryLineker	713307540101144576	2016-03-25T10:12:24	JohnSunCricket MarinaHyde  I'm not sure what you mean, but you're probably correct.
GaryLineker	713292387670474753	2016-03-25T09:12:12	It may well have amused Cruyff, who was famously an atheist  
GaryLineker	713090959341436933	2016-03-24T19:51:47	.GaryLineker says Johan Cruyff was one of the greatest players of all time.   Watch  
GaryLineker	712990086506397697	2016-03-24T13:10:57	Sad to hear that Johan Cruyff has died. Football has lost a man who did more to make the beautiful game beautiful than anyone in history.
GaryLineker	712940462110334976	2016-03-24T09:53:46	"Leicester title bid is more nerve-wracking than taking World cup penalty," GaryLineker.   
GaryLineker	712681657707442176	2016-03-23T16:45:22	GeorgeLineker well that's a dramatic shift.
GaryLineker	712681111059636224	2016-03-23T16:43:12	GeorgeLineker And let me guess, you wish he were your dad?
GaryLineker	712678784739196928	2016-03-23T16:33:57	A book in which I come back to play for England has been nominated for an award. Obviously for comic fiction.  TheresOnlyTwoDavidBeckhams
GaryLineker	712647315811672065	2016-03-23T14:28:55	I feel I'm something of an expert. 
GaryLineker	712645556070391808	2016-03-23T14:21:55	What's it like inside that huge bum, Tubs? A dark and scary place, I imagine?  
GaryLineker	712317914548969473	2016-03-22T16:39:59	henrywinter GrantWahl So close, yet so far.
GaryLineker	712307191357841410	2016-03-22T15:57:23	Never!  
GaryLineker	712306517245095936	2016-03-22T15:54:42	_manishbhasin marvellous.
GaryLineker	712306447795806209	2016-03-22T15:54:25	RalfLittle it's all very bonkers. Marvellous, but bonkers.
GaryLineker	712306121072054272	2016-03-22T15:53:07	GrantWahl no bother.
GaryLineker	712298364440862721	2016-03-22T15:22:18	wtf! 
GaryLineker	712295123661537280	2016-03-22T15:09:25	This is great by GrantWahl but he should know that Elvis lives and played for Leicester.... Aka Frank Worthington. 
GaryLineker	712239166457831425	2016-03-22T11:27:04	The equivalent of Donald SpunkTumpet but without the intellgence, compassion or charm. 
GaryLineker	712228972986245120	2016-03-22T10:46:34	I didn't, but you're spot on. 
GaryLineker	712226315596918784	2016-03-22T10:36:00	Human beings destroying human beings all over the world. Incomprehensible and unstoppable!
GaryLineker	712221295870648320	2016-03-22T10:16:04	Thanks to anthonyfjoshua for giving goalhangerfilms a great insight into his life in the lead up to a world title fight.

GaryLineker	711854890604175360	2016-03-21T10:00:06	MichaelVaughan england he's promising, but doesn't look ready yet.
GaryLineker	711703709646979073	2016-03-20T23:59:21	MichaelGreco2 definitely a bit of Shearer about him.
GaryLineker	711691491769319424	2016-03-20T23:10:48	Congratulations to GarethBale11 on overtaking GaryLineker as Britain‚Äôs top La Liga scorer  
GaryLineker	711689217357783040	2016-03-20T23:01:46	What a fabulous striker Harry Kane has become.

GaryLineker	711679681146318850	2016-03-20T22:23:53	StephensSimon yes, Sir.
GaryLineker	711672000679440384	2016-03-20T21:53:21	suzanne_moore yes, I've been extraordinarily fortunate, in all sorts of ways.

GaryLineker	711601427467128833	2016-03-20T17:12:55	Not really, just used to hang around the 6 yard box. 
GaryLineker	711600510940356608	2016-03-20T17:09:17	Leicester 24 goals (1984/85) Everton 30 goals (1985/86). First division only.  Just saying.  
GaryLineker	711597196219699201	2016-03-20T16:56:07	Definitely a penalty on Rashford. Poor decision.
GaryLineker	711594944910258177	2016-03-20T16:47:10	Utopia! 
GaryLineker	711594542512865281	2016-03-20T16:45:34	Erm.... it's like football didn't exist before the premierleague 
GaryLineker	711594031332122626	2016-03-20T16:43:32	It's a beautiful place to be, at present. 
GaryLineker	711589992196349956	2016-03-20T16:27:29	If they win the Cup then I'd be worried about waking up.  
GaryLineker	711588216814641152	2016-03-20T16:20:26	2 goals already for Harry Kane. Really starting to look like a two-horse race between Leicester and Spurs. How the hell did that happen?
GaryLineker	711587415115354112	2016-03-20T16:17:15	That's a sparkling bit of play from Marcus Rashford.
GaryLineker	711583807930032133	2016-03-20T16:02:55	Really pissed off that it's InternationalDayOfHappiness
