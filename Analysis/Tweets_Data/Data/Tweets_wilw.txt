wilw	695000746966683648	2016-02-03T21:47:45	JessicaValenti I believe that intent also matters. There's an effort to portray all Sanders supporters as sexist, and that's not accurate.

wilw	694997960635998208	2016-02-03T21:36:40	OregonBeast_GT Because Clinton supporters are painting all Sanders supporters with that brush, suggesting she's only opposed by sexists.
wilw	694997606624145408	2016-02-03T21:35:16	jephjacques It's still pejorative, though. It implies that the only reason anyone would oppose Clinton is because of sexism.
