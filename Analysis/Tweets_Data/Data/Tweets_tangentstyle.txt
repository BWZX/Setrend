tangentstyle	696522579432108032	2016-02-08T02:34:58	TomToerpe so EV/EBITDA matters for cap structure, capex in transition? Otherwise PE? I prefer noisy PE to smooth EBITDA on principle
tangentstyle	696521843654713345	2016-02-08T02:32:02	TomToerpe those specifically because? deleveraging, minimal future capex so D&amp;A no proxy for cf spend? No tax till D&amp;A and debt roll off?
tangentstyle	696519125062045696	2016-02-08T02:21:14	TomToerpe AKA valuing equity, no? Still not sure why not PE there... If valuing total firm: EBITDA. Just don't understand why mut exclusive
tangentstyle	696518699914756096	2016-02-08T02:19:33	TomToerpe you mean that EBITDA is the accepted FCF proxy, right? And if valuing the whole biz, people still talk about EBITDA vs PE...

tangentstyle	696208470870245376	2016-02-07T05:46:49	CChristopher51 certainly more stable, but I don't get logic. Could always smooth by removing parts of cost structure I guess

tangentstyle	696206026408857600	2016-02-07T05:37:06	CChristopher51 sure, I guess. Not a super satisfying answer. Right next Q is why PE looks at EBITDA vs PE or best of all FCF
tangentstyle	696205445623648256	2016-02-07T05:34:47	CChristopher51 earns stability is a part of the biz right, why pick EBITDA based on that? And payout shouldn't matter to either, right?
tangentstyle	696205202618241024	2016-02-07T05:33:49	CChristopher51 lev stability helping pick EBITDA vs PE makes sense, not sure I follow earns stability &amp; payout.
tangentstyle	696204738292019200	2016-02-07T05:31:59	CChristopher51 I mean, they're public companies, I'm not sure there is an exit, per se.  And even for private mrkt value, why EBITDA vs PE?
