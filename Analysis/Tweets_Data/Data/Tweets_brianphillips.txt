brianphillips	686268917174517760	2016-01-10T19:30:34	Maybe if your medium is lavish gate-kept NYC networking opportunities, think a *bit* about dissing excluded writers who join up on Twitter?

brianphillips	686264568109088773	2016-01-10T19:13:17	The Unprofessionals 
brianphillips	686262847844659200	2016-01-10T19:06:27	And that's before you consider the pretty spectacular assumption of privilege in calling your literary beau ideals "the unprofessionals."
brianphillips	686215818217144320	2016-01-10T15:59:34	11. Disdaining that connection, assuming it can be had without social media, is a privilege &amp; ignores structural racism, sexism, homophobia.
brianphillips	686215379484553216	2016-01-10T15:57:50	10. Being suspicious of a writer's popularity on social media ignores how popularity comes from the way readers connect to their writing.
brianphillips	686215008464814085	2016-01-10T15:56:21	9. That popularity is not artificial--readers find them on social media first because of their writing.
brianphillips	686214699889864704	2016-01-10T15:55:08	8. The popularity of those writers on social media platforms is why many legacy publishers now work with them.
brianphillips	686214303238631424	2016-01-10T15:53:33	7. Social media made a new level of visibility possible for a diverse group of writers previously shut out of legacy publishing.
