JoeNBC	706311264344084480	2016-03-06T02:51:42	If Trump holds on in KY, Saturday will have been a good night for both Cruz (it's a 2-man race) and Trump (wounded Rubio heading into FL)

JoeNBC	706301258424922112	2016-03-06T02:11:57	All initial Louisiana returns consistent with an easy Trump win. If Rubio fails to hit 20% threshold, his bad night gets even worse.
JoeNBC	706301495679930368	2016-03-06T02:12:53	I think your campaign may be in trouble if every election night is a discussion of whether you can get to 20 percent.
JoeNBC	706285110954426369	2016-03-06T01:07:47	Everything I've said about Rubio for a year, people are only starting to say now. It is weird I've been so right! 
JoeNBC	706284733135769600	2016-03-06T01:06:17	Nope. I don't know him. I've just been about the only one in the national media to correctly not believe the hype.

JoeNBC	706271612660793344	2016-03-06T00:14:09	It's too early in the evening to hyperventilate about Trump. Not too early to discuss more Rubio 3rd place finishes. 
JoeNBC	706271221655183360	2016-03-06T00:12:35	Already said 1/ he loses caucuses 2/ margin matters in Louisiana primary  3/ Michigan poll has Kasich ahead.  
JoeNBC	706264881893347328	2016-03-05T23:47:24	Trump loses caucuses. All eyes now on Louisiana tonight. A closer than expected primary fight there could be a sign of a tightening race.
JoeNBC	706264278748303360	2016-03-05T23:45:00	Don't you look at the guy who is winning the second most? That's Cruz by a mile.

JoeNBC	706261567256596480	2016-03-05T23:34:13	It is preposterous for anyone to argue one second longer that Rubio has the best chance to stop Trump.  
JoeNBC	706261288922554368	2016-03-05T23:33:07	Given Cruz's continued success and Rubio's continued failure, why wouldn't pressure rise for Rubio to drop out? 
JoeNBC	706260671143534592	2016-03-05T23:30:40	If the GOP establishment really wants to stop Trump, it's looking more obvious that Cruz is their ticket. Rubio just keeps losing.
JoeNBC	706256181128331264	2016-03-05T23:12:49	With enough strong third place finishes, they'll have to award the nomination to Rubio.

JoeNBC	705845646272679936	2016-03-04T20:01:30	And for the record, we knew Trump as a fellow NBC employee. We always asked colleagues for charitable gifts.  
JoeNBC	705844577828270085	2016-03-04T19:57:15	I don't remember leaving any voice mails with him, but it certainly appears to be regarding a children's charity.  
JoeNBC	705843691496337408	2016-03-04T19:53:44	Through the years, we asked Trump (and many others) to contribute to various charities, including David Axelrod's CURE charity for epilepsy.
JoeNBC	705843271130554372	2016-03-04T19:52:04	Oh my God. I just read the transcripts! Trump must have contributed to a children's charity. Scandalous!!!

JoeNBC	705797010541174784	2016-03-04T16:48:15	You're not alone. The media has been ignoring the rotting floorboards below Rubio's political feet for a year now.  
JoeNBC	705796523804774401	2016-03-04T16:46:18	So again...why has the media and GOP been so delusional about Marco Rubio for the past year? It's confounding.  
JoeNBC	705796112892993537	2016-03-04T16:44:41	Christie's 30% approval in NJ is irrelevant to this race. Rubio's disastrous 31% rating in Florida matters greatly.  
JoeNBC	705795334107238401	2016-03-04T16:41:35	The media has obsessed over Christie's 30% approval rating in NJ. But no so much over Rubio's 31% rating in Florida. 
JoeNBC	705793597489201152	2016-03-04T16:34:41	Any Republican that dismisses North Florida in a GOP primary is ignorant. It's the victory lane in GOP primaries.  
JoeNBC	705759107328954368	2016-03-04T14:17:38	Trump won't win Florida by 20 but if the establishment's hopes rest on Florida, they're toast.  
JoeNBC	705758372826583041	2016-03-04T14:14:43	Marco can win the state, of course. I just see more of the same from the establishment letting wishes cloud reality. 
JoeNBC	705758072212480000	2016-03-04T14:13:31	I said it was 20. I was talking about Marco being 24 points underwater in his Florida approval rating.

JoeNBC	705715784899829760	2016-03-04T11:25:29	Seriously? We talked about how people expect it from Trump. Just talking about him getting down in the mud with him.
