apextrader	504356597179895808	2014-08-26T19:55:57	Feeling like one of the cool kids lately; I love bull markets... 
apextrader	494212736034045952	2014-07-29T20:07:52	TWTR plus 2.31 in 15 seconds, lololol
apextrader	493780040497512448	2014-07-28T15:28:30	SANM ready to rock here
apextrader	483994236187336704	2014-07-01T15:23:12	Funny to think back to when AAPL was the momo stock; barely moved today
apextrader	483993166748856320	2014-07-01T15:18:57	Days like this make me feel smarter/better than I really am; trimming lots into this strength: DDD, XONE, TWTR, some FB
apextrader	483638400629886976	2014-06-30T15:49:14	Mkt seems in nose bleed range, but currently liking some charts: AMBA, HOLI; laggard MXWL for a rebound
apextrader	483635306038837248	2014-06-30T15:36:57	xone and ddd treating me right today; been hitting singles in these 3D names but holding has been the real win
apextrader	476362034221948928	2014-06-10T13:55:33	FB news prob getting people excited about TWTR as well; through 35.15 perhaps good long
apextrader	476361660543033344	2014-06-10T13:54:04	WB getting up and going this morning
apextrader	464504946776604672	2014-05-08T20:39:44	Anybody think AAPL looks like a nice short through today's lows?  I do...
apextrader	459052950925484032	2014-04-23T19:35:26	It's gappy, but MYGN looking interesting here at 39.80
apextrader	458376016595910656	2014-04-21T22:45:33	Wondering of TWTR is made a bottom and turning up now, similar to FB following IPO
apextrader	458374461356380160	2014-04-21T22:39:22	I see quite a few charts that look good for a bounce $$  Long a handful of those now.
