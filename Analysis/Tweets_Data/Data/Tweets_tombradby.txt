tombradby	701842813663768576	2016-02-22T18:55:41	A little taster of what's to come on TheAgenda tonight. Is it ever OK for public figures to lose their cool? 
tombradby	701797893716447233	2016-02-22T15:57:11	EU IN/OUT? The discussion starts now. Hear from us tonight 10.40pm  agendaitv tombradby JWhittingdale TheFemaleGreer PCollinsTimes

tombradby	701766564031438852	2016-02-22T13:52:41	Or, to be put it another way, we might not actually know whether we ARE better or worse of for 10 years. Another ref in 2026?
tombradby	701765292205195264	2016-02-22T13:47:38	Switzerland took 7 years to negotiate two bilateral sets of trade deals. The 2nd lot (agreed between 2001- 4) have not all been enacted.
tombradby	701764399447597056	2016-02-22T13:44:05	And it is difficult to get a handle on what the final deals might look like and what price (in terms of concessions) we would have to make.
tombradby	701764140726165505	2016-02-22T13:43:03	I suspect this is a key part of the calculation Boris has made. But it is amost impossible to price in the cost of uncertainty.
tombradby	701763930222415873	2016-02-22T13:42:13	Or to put it another way; whatever we decide, nothing is likely to happen quickly.
tombradby	701763778229227520	2016-02-22T13:41:37	...I think a sensible time frame might be five to ten years. Don't you think?
tombradby	701763472229588994	2016-02-22T13:40:24	That can be extended if unanimously agreed. Given that it would be in everyone's interests for the UK to leave with a deal in place...
tombradby	701763089595813888	2016-02-22T13:38:53	Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty stipulates that, after pulling the exit chord, a membership ceases after 2 years.
tombradby	701762866198740994	2016-02-22T13:38:00	The country had a population of 50,000 - a quarter of the size of the London Borough of Camden. And the deal was over 1 industry; fishing.
tombradby	701762621440135168	2016-02-22T13:37:01	Preparing for the agendaitv tonight, encountered this; When Greenland left in 1982, it spent 3 years negotiating a trade deal with the EEC.
tombradby	701734313163935744	2016-02-22T11:44:32	I REALLY hope New Day (new newspaper by the Mirror) succeeds. It would be great to feel the industry is not just surviving but thriving.

tombradby	701524053971042305	2016-02-21T21:49:02	Terrific scoop by peston earlier this week on Boris Johnson and Michael Gove going Out. And an electrifying development.
tombradby	700741403496861697	2016-02-19T17:59:04	I honestly don't know how the British can ever work with an organisation that numbers floors like this. Brexit 
tombradby	700737623359356931	2016-02-19T17:44:03	Breakfast? Cancelled. Lunch? Abandoned. Dinner?  Not till 8, if at all. So Angela Merkel heads out for chips Brexit

tombradby	700418690215473152	2016-02-18T20:36:43	Coming up on NewsatTen Europe, British Gas profits, Meningitis B vaccine and when tombradby met yokoono 
tombradby	700419780864565249	2016-02-18T20:41:03	Did a fascinating interview with yokoono today. An extraordinary life. Here she is talking about feminism; 
tombradby	700342234823192576	2016-02-18T15:32:55	On NewsAtTen TomBradby talks exclusively to YokoOno as she receives NME's Inspiration Award on her 83rd birthday 
tombradby	700088069836443649	2016-02-17T22:42:57	So, all round, the stakes are very high; for the country and for all the leading figures in the governing party.
tombradby	700087961124208641	2016-02-17T22:42:31	But he would have potentially have to deal with the fallout of an exit vote, which might be extremely tricky and sour his popularity quickly
tombradby	700087766982508549	2016-02-17T22:41:45	I would think it would then be odds on to elect Boris as leader.
tombradby	700087632869638144	2016-02-17T22:41:13	If the PM loses, he will almost certainly have to resign. And if he doesn't, the party will probably boot him out.
tombradby	700087464359280640	2016-02-17T22:40:33	It will also be two battles; one in the country at large, the second for the heart and soul of the Tory Party.
tombradby	700087335145312258	2016-02-17T22:40:02	A terrific scoop from Peston tonight. If Boris J and Michael Gove plump for the Out camp, the PM has a real battle on his hands.
