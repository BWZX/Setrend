JoelKruger	725662262686527488	2016-04-28T12:25:40	Here's why I just bought USDJPY  FX trading globalmacro BOJ NIRP 
JoelKruger	725629442144518144	2016-04-28T10:15:15	zoomchank Like it below 1.0900. 👍 
JoelKruger	725597383510351877	2016-04-28T08:07:51	It's possible the Yen may have strengthened even more had the BOJ eased, given the lack of enthusiasm for accommodative gestures in 2016.
JoelKruger	725591427397353472	2016-04-28T07:44:11	Here's why I just bought USDJPY  FX trading globalmacro BOJ NIRP 
JoelKruger	725579370828550144	2016-04-28T06:56:17	USDJPY has now traded close to 4X its average daily range! This comes after BOJ did nothing. I am now a buyer. 🙈 
JoelKruger	725547344905703425	2016-04-28T04:49:01	ScoMo cld be lucky  with RBA - Stevens already sd not too worried by inflation dip  below target band  via smh
JoelKruger	725545227990216704	2016-04-28T04:40:36	BOJ probably thought would be better to do nothing and see USDJPY supported into dip, than add stimulus and watch USDJPY fail into a rally.
JoelKruger	725538763015872512	2016-04-28T04:14:55	Just a quick FYI  - USDJPY has already moved over 3X its average daily range at 307.8% ahead of the European open! 
JoelKruger	725524759732178946	2016-04-28T03:19:16	Big question considering price action in recent months is would USDJPY be trading 105 now had the BOJ added stimulus? :)
JoelKruger	725524305564557313	2016-04-28T03:17:28	Key here is the Bank of Japan again moved the goalposts on reaching that 2% inflation target
JoelKruger	725523892954128385	2016-04-28T03:15:50	LWInvestment Agreed. But going to hold off. Maybe into one more dip will be worth the shot. But def might miss it. 
JoelKruger	725523561415335936	2016-04-28T03:14:31	CazNewman Would consider buying USDJPY...but only into 108-108.50 area. Already short SPX500 from last week.  
JoelKruger	725522142884978688	2016-04-28T03:08:53	Hard to argue against the fact that the BOJ decision doesn't have an impact on US equity futures. SPX500 SPX stocks Woa
