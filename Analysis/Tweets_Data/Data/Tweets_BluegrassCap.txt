BluegrassCap	691004446357221378	2016-01-23T21:07:52	dasan &gt;interesting to me that SPO has big position in EQIX, given their history w the cell tower operators 
BluegrassCap	691003835477839874	2016-01-23T21:05:27	dasan exactly, reasonable valuation on AFFO x for a co that could grow organically HSD revs for next 10 yrs

BluegrassCap	691002458974326785	2016-01-23T20:59:59	dasan think RAX is more of wholesale (commodity, low margin) data center owner whereas EQIX is the premier internet exchange operator with
BluegrassCap	691001526450524161	2016-01-23T20:56:16	dasan no, its just that EQIX probably owns the largest # of the most valuable internet exchange points, vs EQIX's peers

BluegrassCap	691000994956734464	2016-01-23T20:54:10	dasan they pay for the interconnection access that EQIX owns, which links AWS most efficiently to other large volume networks
