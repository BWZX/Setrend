noahchestnut	724986818614165504	2016-04-26T15:41:41	gabestein moorehn I still prefer revenue models where pubs are tailored to solving Y problem and people pay $ for it (for the record)
noahchestnut	724986122930106368	2016-04-26T15:38:55	gabestein moorehn And then the ads (like Cable in the late 90s in particular) become extra revenue based on ratings.
noahchestnut	724985864586186752	2016-04-26T15:37:54	gabestein moorehn They currently pay pubs to try products like FB Live, but I could see a more formalized system at work.
noahchestnut	724985740233428993	2016-04-26T15:37:24	gabestein moorehn Instead of a relative and unpredictable ad share model, why wouldn't FB start paying pubs a guaranteed rate?

noahchestnut	724969862553022465	2016-04-26T14:34:19	WebBarr Agree with all of this! The fact that they could produce a TV show in a few weeks... not too shabby.

noahchestnut	724400651845963776	2016-04-25T00:52:28	nick_bunker You should start collecting all of these... Or I should. Setting up some search parameters now...

noahchestnut	723187545861922816	2016-04-21T16:32:01	nickblunden I see The Economist and have a set of assumptions. Is this unfair? Maybe. But my brand assumptions are all positive.
noahchestnut	723187372184199168	2016-04-21T16:31:20	nickblunden For sure! I guess what stood out to me last night is that The Economist as a brand isn't as malleable as BuzzFeed.
noahchestnut	723184864502140928	2016-04-21T16:21:22	nickblunden charlie_simpson Coming from The Economist, it felt off. &lt; / that's it!&gt;
noahchestnut	723184786098020352	2016-04-21T16:21:03	nickblunden charlie_simpson ...is that in the long-run 1843 can publish these types of posts and I can choose to follow it for them
noahchestnut	723184675037057026	2016-04-21T16:20:37	nickblunden charlie_simpson And the author of that Game of Thrones piece is a fascinating person, for sure. My point on two brands...
noahchestnut	723184568958881792	2016-04-21T16:20:12	nickblunden charlie_simpson That all makes sense and you may have caught me during a moment of late night cold medicine snark.
noahchestnut	723150345405341696	2016-04-21T14:04:12	WebBarr Same. I love bookmarking, highlighting (maybe Medium's best feature?) and occasionally responding to a post.
noahchestnut	723150104476131328	2016-04-21T14:03:15	WebBarr I'd wager Google is responsible for 35-40% of their new user acquisition. Email is probably their best non-app retention tool.
noahchestnut	723149478165884929	2016-04-21T14:00:45	WebBarr Medium isn't a full destination (yet), but they are bringing in lots of quality pubs. Quora's AMA feature is good, but not enough.
noahchestnut	723149291552944129	2016-04-21T14:00:01	WebBarr Agreed! Is Quora : Google :: BuzzFeed : Facebook or is Quora (and BuzzFeed) a destination in its own right?
noahchestnut	723147976215023617	2016-04-21T13:54:47	WebBarr I did. They ads remind me a bit of adwords to be honest (search = their best feature?)

noahchestnut	722968289853341696	2016-04-21T02:00:47	charlie_simpson I believe it used to be called Intelligent Life or something like that
noahchestnut	722968179203428353	2016-04-21T02:00:20	charlie_simpson Ha! They used to have this more lifestyle magazine that was recently rebranded to 1843
noahchestnut	722967647541841920	2016-04-21T01:58:13	charlie_simpson That tweet was way to cavalier with why we give The Economist our attention in the first place
noahchestnut	722967389923483648	2016-04-21T01:57:12	charlie_simpson So I think the Economist really needs to keep that 1843 brand separate. Totally different publication.

noahchestnut	722498224670380033	2016-04-19T18:52:54	Instead of a cheese consumption competition, I'd gladly tune into a FB Live stream of Vulture editors brainstorming 
noahchestnut	722497553837662208	2016-04-19T18:50:14	noahchestnut WebBarr The Ezra Klein show with Jim Yong Kim is outstanding 
noahchestnut	722497276262744064	2016-04-19T18:49:08	WebBarr The Ezra Klein Show = maybe Vox's best product? The Weeds podcast is also exceptional.

noahchestnut	722496456716713984	2016-04-19T18:45:53	WebBarr Today is a good Monkbent day. Ezra Klein podcast + big Apple piece.

noahchestnut	722495069597532160	2016-04-19T18:40:22	bmorrissey Can they keep this up? Sadly, yes. But I do think this is partially why Snapchat is growing so quickly. Much more deliberate...
noahchestnut	722494833995022337	2016-04-19T18:39:26	bmorrissey Since FB Live wasn't a standalone consumer app (like Paper or Rooms), I'm assuming FB is ok annoying folks to make this work
noahchestnut	722493128591060993	2016-04-19T18:32:39	bmorrissey Agreed! And the experiments will come across as that much more bizarre a year or two from now. The key is FB Live isn't for all!
noahchestnut	722492953243987968	2016-04-19T18:31:57	fmanjoo stevekovach Well the wirecutter still recommends the 13 air... 
noahchestnut	722492557200986112	2016-04-19T18:30:23	steverousseau Making it look easy is so key to most things televised (sports to cooking shows to AM talk).
noahchestnut	722491910632267776	2016-04-19T18:27:49	steverousseau Yes! I'm ready for the "I like hanging out with these people in the background" genre of FB Live (daytime talk)
noahchestnut	722488693437521920	2016-04-19T18:15:02	The current state of Facebook Live videos reminds me of the "what did you eat for lunch" Twitter era. Give it time folks.
noahchestnut	722487980653301760	2016-04-19T18:12:12	nbashaw Anyways... really liked this story!

noahchestnut	722487759764480000	2016-04-19T18:11:19	nbashaw I like the use of a "do people like this?" metric. My comment was more about pageview versus reads or another more accessible term
noahchestnut	722487262701703168	2016-04-19T18:09:21	nbashaw One small tweak: consider a different term than page views? Reads? 
noahchestnut	722487062243332096	2016-04-19T18:08:33	nbashaw Love the "bedtime" story format for a Hardbound story. This style and tone work well for a more casual explainer.

noahchestnut	722139119359361024	2016-04-18T19:05:57	WebBarr Agreed. I'd assume Hollywood Studios have a better sense of Oscars with the Box Office? Director retention? Bringing in actors?
noahchestnut	722138985049403392	2016-04-18T19:05:25	WebBarr Agreed. To me its a Q of how are brands sold on buying ads w/a publisher. Awards help, but this decisionmaking process is opaque

noahchestnut	718443415961100288	2016-04-08T14:20:33	seangriffey AKAarsalan I never got the impression ESPN judges 538 on its traffic. Maybe podcast audience, but not web traffic
noahchestnut	718443186805321728	2016-04-08T14:19:38	seangriffey AKAarsalan The value is in possible brand advertising, attracting new talent and idea generation for documentaries
noahchestnut	718443006282498048	2016-04-08T14:18:55	seangriffey AKAarsalan There was never a clear value outside of a bump in direct traffic (they don't measure that in a granular way)
noahchestnut	718442223646351360	2016-04-08T14:15:48	AKAarsalan seangriffey A good test is to see how committed ESPN is to podcasts / radio on their app. 538 is great for that.

noahchestnut	714452588012249088	2016-03-28T14:02:25	This is incredible for so many reasons 
noahchestnut	714452246608490496	2016-03-28T14:01:04	markham Seconded. Anomaly does great work. I'm also a sucker for their lack of shame when using puppies to push products.
noahchestnut	714441444501622784	2016-03-28T13:18:08	Chronotope I wonder what inputs they are using outside of last purchase + search history
noahchestnut	714299088187994113	2016-03-28T03:52:28	donohoe The most recent Atavist series - Mastermind - is bonkers in all the best ways 
noahchestnut	714219642131058688	2016-03-27T22:36:46	mccanner When you are waiting at the International arrivals terminal... Your mind... Goes to strange places
noahchestnut	714219204828770305	2016-03-27T22:35:02	mkramer Yes! And that's how we should cook. It's about reference, understanding and confidence not just checking off a list
noahchestnut	714219010502463489	2016-03-27T22:34:16	mccanner WW History Class : 30 Rock :: West Wing Weekly : Studio 60
noahchestnut	714218856470851584	2016-03-27T22:33:39	mccanner So what I'd love as a fan is if you guest hosted the superior West Wing History Class with plante and RussFrushtick...
noahchestnut	714213788929490945	2016-03-27T22:13:31	mkramer Also great comments on your recipie 
noahchestnut	714212968393629696	2016-03-27T22:10:15	mkramer Nice! I'm an avid NYT Cooking user. I have chicken and potatoes marinating to cook 
noahchestnut	714206081052880896	2016-03-27T21:42:53	ForecasterEnten Get a co-host and record a new history podcast? I'm interested to check out a pilot episode. Cc jodyavirgan
noahchestnut	714163829391757312	2016-03-27T18:55:00	MaxTemkin Ha! Well then... Carry on. (and I love that I can signup for email updates about a physical mailing company... it makes sense!)
noahchestnut	714161877454970880	2016-03-27T18:47:14	MaxTemkin The costs are higher, but I still think sending something physical may be the best route to reach your "+3s"
noahchestnut	714161753362268160	2016-03-27T18:46:45	MaxTemkin I'm with you as I've worn both the direct mail and digital (email, social, retargeting) hats for publishers...
noahchestnut	714161596004577280	2016-03-27T18:46:07	MaxTemkin Have y'all considered direct mail? You probably have a lot of your +3s addresses / y'all's thoughtful designs would work well
noahchestnut	714158838182580224	2016-03-27T18:35:10	nbashaw MSUDebate Ha! I had no idea you debated for Repko! Small damn worlds indeed.
noahchestnut	714148848567001088	2016-03-27T17:55:28	nbashaw Yup! Small worlds. I debated policy (HS in Tampa; Undergrad at Northwestern; Coached at USC after)
noahchestnut	714143812948332545	2016-03-27T17:35:27	benthompson Agreed! I signed up as well after your tweet. Lexis should've created a referral bonus...
noahchestnut	714143475436953600	2016-03-27T17:34:07	benthompson And for reference we are both former policy debate folks who learned lexis as 14 year olds ~2000/2001
noahchestnut	714143313717125120	2016-03-27T17:33:28	benthompson Both. His argument for news is too much duplicative wire content and odd assortment of digital news
noahchestnut	714139958500429824	2016-03-27T17:20:08	benthompson Makes sense. Westlaw has taken most of the market. A lawyer friend just compared Lexis to Hotmail. Something everyone had.
noahchestnut	714135824359510017	2016-03-27T17:03:43	chrismaddern As a kid I looked forward to using coin-operated TV chairs at the airport

noahchestnut	714088263921721344	2016-03-27T13:54:43	mdudas Final recommendation - next time you want to watch TV, don't and turn on a podcast instead.
noahchestnut	714087798282694656	2016-03-27T13:52:52	mdudas Also... If you can... Before falling asleep. Turn on a sleep timer (all podcast apps have 'em) and try it out.
noahchestnut	714087633157120000	2016-03-27T13:52:13	mdudas I'd avoid the workout pattern as it usually diminishes your cardio and you don't remember the podcast as well
noahchestnut	714087490760519680	2016-03-27T13:51:39	mdudas When you are doing something else that is relatively mindless -- cleaning dishes, folding laundry -- or commuting / walking
noahchestnut	713833267825352704	2016-03-26T21:01:28	WebBarr Also... About to say hello to a cheeseburger. Thanks for the conversation. Good to meet you.
noahchestnut	713833126582214656	2016-03-26T21:00:54	WebBarr Agreed. And I think one-off services can be great when they solve an acute problem
noahchestnut	713832430642315264	2016-03-26T20:58:08	WebBarr When Amazon starts treating me like Comcast does.... Then I'll stop paying that tax (cord cutting)
noahchestnut	713832211615711234	2016-03-26T20:57:16	WebBarr What I find so interesting is how a company that designs and lucks into a tax -- telecos -- can squander a consumers trust
noahchestnut	713832011660701697	2016-03-26T20:56:28	WebBarr I love AWS bc there are so many more products I get to test and enjoy. I don't love poorly managed one-off contracts
noahchestnut	713831773462007810	2016-03-26T20:55:31	WebBarr I think as a consumer I prefer to enter longer term service based relationships that improve my life + community + world
noahchestnut	713831599675146242	2016-03-26T20:54:50	WebBarr From the 50s to the 90s, many people paid a media "tax" for a variety of reasons.
noahchestnut	713831439071109120	2016-03-26T20:54:12	WebBarr First -- I'm conceptually good with recurring payments (or taxes). I like paying for defense, roads, schools, etc
noahchestnut	713831219587375104	2016-03-26T20:53:19	WebBarr exponentfm benthompson Too many thoughts for Twitter... I'll do my best with just you.
noahchestnut	713827604726296576	2016-03-26T20:38:57	WebBarr mobile_reach I'd expect B/R's tech to run CNN if bureaucracy  didn't stand in the way
noahchestnut	713827439994994688	2016-03-26T20:38:18	WebBarr mobile_reach For sure. Especially as they build features to track and publish to other platforms. B/R is also great at this.
noahchestnut	713826505294393344	2016-03-26T20:34:35	mobile_reach WebBarr Yet... if I'm a young &amp; growing publisher, I want to be on Vox's Chorus or BuzzFeed's SuperPoster.
noahchestnut	713826284351004673	2016-03-26T20:33:43	mobile_reach WebBarr I think a challenge will be if your test on Medium works... do you leave? Where do you go?
noahchestnut	713826192881635328	2016-03-26T20:33:21	mobile_reach WebBarr I get that. If you want to get started as an individual or small team, Medium = easier and cheaper compared to WP.
noahchestnut	713826104163741697	2016-03-26T20:33:00	mobile_reach WebBarr Medium = great fit for "SMBs" whereas Wordpress can work for folks like Quartz or TIME.
noahchestnut	713825899146190848	2016-03-26T20:32:11	mobile_reach WebBarr So I finally listened to that "Monkbent" podcast about Medium and I think y'all are talking about diffenent pubs.
noahchestnut	713823650319740928	2016-03-26T20:23:15	jeremybowers I still miss Nate's porch recaps of Scandal Season 1.
noahchestnut	713823595336630272	2016-03-26T20:23:01	jeremybowers Ha! Well... you know I'm just waiting for you and Nate_Cohn to head over to the new NYT Watching to recap TV shows...
noahchestnut	713823346056507392	2016-03-26T20:22:02	jeremybowers but I love to click on estimated remaining votes...
noahchestnut	713806568312213507	2016-03-26T19:15:22	Algorithmic sexism from Google, MarchMadness edition 
noahchestnut	713820275872169984	2016-03-26T20:09:50	libbyanelson The randalltbush "discard odds and ends of veg prep bowl" = a genius addition to how I need to cook.
noahchestnut	713469833350942722	2016-03-25T20:57:18	libbyanelson I love this. I think a decent amount of people new to cooking stop because the mess becomes uncontrollable
noahchestnut	713436006632919040	2016-03-25T18:42:53	mobile_reach WebBarr Keep going y'all. I've got to bounce for a bit. Will catch-up later!
noahchestnut	713434321781071872	2016-03-25T18:36:11	WebBarr I get it. And as a reader, I'd love to have better products across the board. Medium helps kill the Outbrain/Taboolas + display...
noahchestnut	713432517412388864	2016-03-25T18:29:01	WebBarr So the migration from Medium -&gt; owned stack will be fascinating
noahchestnut	713432098598588417	2016-03-25T18:27:21	WebBarr I think/hope Medium will help a lot of people make $ to write great things. I love that. But I don't love monopolies / monocultures
noahchestnut	713431874517880832	2016-03-25T18:26:28	WebBarr For the Ringer, that's fine since their real revenue comes from non-text. For many... not the case.
noahchestnut	713431770071302144	2016-03-25T18:26:03	WebBarr So I agree with the first part -- Ringer doesn't need to support a stack -- but it also means Medium owns all product decisions.
noahchestnut	713430858858823680	2016-03-25T18:22:26	WebBarr What episode of Exponent called out an AWS for text? I missed that one.
noahchestnut	713430740961087488	2016-03-25T18:21:58	mathewi WebBarr benthompson I'd also love to read some reporting on The Information and if their Nest reporting impacted new subs
noahchestnut	713429114334490624	2016-03-25T18:15:30	jeremybowers and maybe that's their target audience! I'm not in the "fine brine" business.
noahchestnut	713429041261350912	2016-03-25T18:15:12	jeremybowers How is that can not green? The design is, well, it is what it is... but it reminds me of a cheap champagne...
noahchestnut	713426617083629568	2016-03-25T18:05:34	mathewi I'm blown away by the quality and caliber of subscribers to Hot Pod as evident by the forum discussions. Makes me a believer.
noahchestnut	713426390503133185	2016-03-25T18:04:40	mathewi benthompson For sure! Though I think Ben shows that a dedicated interest (with an assumption on audience income) = good chance!
noahchestnut	713426231731990528	2016-03-25T18:04:03	benthompson mathewi I don't think there is one magical # for all people. (Sorry... I've been thinking a lot 'bout this)
noahchestnut	713426061111926785	2016-03-25T18:03:22	benthompson mathewi When enough folks keep coming back and refreshing for new content, you have proven market fit.
noahchestnut	713425955281199104	2016-03-25T18:02:57	benthompson mathewi For # of subs... I like one of Ben's earlier podcasts where he mentioned repeat homepage traffic as an indicator...
noahchestnut	713425832149065729	2016-03-25T18:02:27	benthompson mathewi Examples exist... Neil Cybart's Above Avalon (Apple), Nick Quah's Hot Pod (podcasts)...
noahchestnut	713412311352881152	2016-03-25T17:08:44	drvox This is one reason as to why I love nwquah's Hot Pod newsletter + forums. Communities still exist!

noahchestnut	711924410991546368	2016-03-21T14:36:21	chaykak I think growing may be a good sign!?!
noahchestnut	711923215891701760	2016-03-21T14:31:36	chaykak I dunno! +I'm kind of feeling silly rushing to judgement and having too many ~takes~. I'm going to slow down and see what happens!
noahchestnut	711922750835691520	2016-03-21T14:29:45	chaykak This who versus what are they buying is a great idea. I think most studio heads want to buy people not projects.
noahchestnut	711922622473248768	2016-03-21T14:29:14	chaykak So right now Matter feels like a marketing tool for a talent agency if not a new talent agency. Maybe that is a great idea!
noahchestnut	711922505594744833	2016-03-21T14:28:46	chaykak Yet they were providing that space on someone else's dime to grow a startup. I don't see a talent agency sharing that belief
noahchestnut	711921807993876480	2016-03-21T14:26:00	chaykak So I owe you a longer thread on studyhallxyz (taking this out of DMs). I vastly prefer your model of physical space -&gt; work

noahchestnut	711921034677456896	2016-03-21T14:22:56	chaykak I love the UCB -&gt; SNL model. It isn't perfect, but it makes more sense to me compared to what see in Vice or maybe Matter
noahchestnut	711920900069691393	2016-03-21T14:22:24	chaykak I'm biased towards a model where young talent learns as a group by trying lots of things and then they move on with an audience
noahchestnut	711920587489153024	2016-03-21T14:21:09	chaykak True! But I'm also really curious how long Matter can last with a negative P&amp;L...
noahchestnut	711920380089225216	2016-03-21T14:20:20	chaykak I'm curious how many of these deals actually lead to finished products...
noahchestnut	711920305879388161	2016-03-21T14:20:02	chaykak Since they are working with ICM, I'll assume the early revenue will be holding deals for tv and movies. Lots of pilots and scripts

noahchestnut	711905674653884416	2016-03-21T13:21:54	roseveleth This sounds like a Snapchat discover channel. I'm not even joking. I'd love this to exist.
noahchestnut	711904628812566529	2016-03-21T13:17:44	What makes the Upshot special? The graphics team. I'll co-sign  Nate_Cohn's explanation to ThePollsters

noahchestnut	711733981180534784	2016-03-21T01:59:39	libovness What is worth taking a picture of?
noahchestnut	711732700751732736	2016-03-21T01:54:33	AthertonKD jaredbkeller carlfranzen To be fair... Twitter uses a damn lightning bolt as the Moments icon so storms were forecasted
noahchestnut	711731175962845188	2016-03-21T01:48:30	Interesting to see Moments become Storify 
noahchestnut	711730822802497536	2016-03-21T01:47:06	ckurdziel Yup. In 2012 I thought Google+ would be my YouTube feed

noahchestnut	711626852377317377	2016-03-20T18:53:57	tomstandage Still waiting for their House Harkonnen sleep wear or Atredies formal wear.
noahchestnut	711608387222384641	2016-03-20T17:40:35	What should be more likely: Twitter bans brands from using Snapchat codes as profile pics _or_ Twitter builds a follow on Snapchat feature?
noahchestnut	711590246907940865	2016-03-20T16:28:30	richarddeitsch One thing I especially enjoy about ZachLowe_NBA on podcasts (his, yours, BS back in the Grantland days) is his openess.
noahchestnut	711590083904741377	2016-03-20T16:27:51	richarddeitsch ZachLowe_NBA Really loved this episode. Even Zach's blantant pandering to make top 10 lists.
noahchestnut	711588512764563456	2016-03-20T16:21:36	nbashaw Nope. I just keep my phone on permanent silence. No vibrate. No sounds. Taking off my watch = DND since I use haptic feedback.

noahchestnut	711586577172987907	2016-03-20T16:13:55	jcstearns wirecutter Same! Nearly all "splurge" purchases came from the Wirecutter (new speakers + receiver) or Sweethome (dutch oven)
noahchestnut	711585528655687680	2016-03-20T16:09:45	Amazon should let me manually increase the wirecutter's commission %. A minuscule revenue drop for Amazon for real brand equity gains

noahchestnut	711360104713605120	2016-03-20T01:14:00	jbenton BenMullin I wouldn't say it is all that insightful at least with analysis. But it captures the tone and logic so well
noahchestnut	711359561429553152	2016-03-20T01:11:50	jbenton BenMullin Yeah. Their first solo podcast (no Simmons) eerily took me back to my time working with former WH comms people.
noahchestnut	711358669569597440	2016-03-20T01:08:17	jbenton BenMullin Also in BSN podcast news... Simmons arguably has the most insidery DC podcast with Pffeifer and Favreau.
noahchestnut	711357707043926016	2016-03-20T01:04:28	jbenton BenMullin Also... His sense of identity and Judaism... I kind of wish Tablet would profile Glazer

noahchestnut	711348092113563648	2016-03-20T00:26:16	charlie_simpson jeremybowers Interesting... The Julia defectors would be fun to play a board game against
noahchestnut	711347600721645568	2016-03-20T00:24:18	charlie_simpson jeremybowers It's funny. I grew so frustrated with the first half being about caricatures of Musk, Tyson, Hillary...
noahchestnut	711347398430199808	2016-03-20T00:23:30	charlie_simpson jeremybowers I really wanted to root for the Neil degrasse Tyson character, but I couldn't even do that
noahchestnut	711347084306157572	2016-03-20T00:22:15	charlie_simpson jeremybowers I love the Shaftoe clan. SevenEves has moments, but that novel needed some serious rework.
noahchestnut	711335390565650433	2016-03-19T23:35:47	jeremybowers better than Seven Eves. I want that week back

noahchestnut	711228399163867136	2016-03-19T16:30:39	ischafer cc_chapman Did you publish these IFTTT Echo recipes to your public profile? My echo is in the mail and I'd love to try some out!
noahchestnut	710970282559705088	2016-03-18T23:24:59	alexlaprade Likewise. Though my Evernote is also a weird history/mess of URLs I've saved via bookmarks or as scrapped pages via Clearly.
noahchestnut	710970021321703424	2016-03-18T23:23:56	alexlaprade I know... The iPad Pro is a fancy toy that I'll never actually need.
noahchestnut	710964610686328832	2016-03-18T23:02:26	alexlaprade Also...my camera roll is a weird collection of app flow screenshots + photos of my quick pen and paper drawings + whiteboards
noahchestnut	710963768809775104	2016-03-18T22:59:06	ryandawidjan alexlaprade I also think reading and seeing benthompson's iPad sketches using Paper as a whiteboard helped persuade me
noahchestnut	710963593433391104	2016-03-18T22:58:24	ryandawidjan alexlaprade If I had a spare $1,500 I'd buy an iPad Pro and Pencil to see if that helped my workflow
noahchestnut	710963343339560960	2016-03-18T22:57:24	alexlaprade The key for me is to explain myself to my colleagues and wires to higher fidelity comps in Sketch change the conversation
noahchestnut	710963133074944000	2016-03-18T22:56:34	alexlaprade I've always done it, but I'm increasingly sharing photos of my sketches as inline photos when writing a case for us to do X
noahchestnut	710961845608140800	2016-03-18T22:51:27	alexlaprade Same. I'm sketching quite a bit on paper (dead trees not the FiftyThree app) and sharing photos of these hand drawn sketches.

noahchestnut	710130060443824128	2016-03-16T15:46:14	robinsloan I miss having the time (and I guess occupation) to find, utilize and respect places like this. Thanks for your tweet.

noahchestnut	709937785986125825	2016-03-16T03:02:12	jbenton Agreed. My only _small_ criticism is that some of the byline avatars look too damn similar!
noahchestnut	709936823984738304	2016-03-16T02:58:23	jasonfried Agreed! And like many innovators, existing interests - dealers - will lobby against change 
noahchestnut	709936153256787969	2016-03-16T02:55:43	jasonfried I'd wager a large part of the friction lies in manufacturers, dealers and rental companies all having different incentives.

noahchestnut	700378454571659264	2016-02-18T17:56:50	rafat elanazak For example, the "Dress" post gained traction via Twitter

noahchestnut	700375303441530881	2016-02-18T17:44:19	KSoltisAnderson As Facebook Messenger wants to take over more customer support functionality, Twitter has an advantage b/c it is public.

noahchestnut	700334850847281152	2016-02-18T15:03:34	csnguyen So the NBA trade machine project started this winter as I want to be able to at least talk Python. Slower road than I'd like.
noahchestnut	700331566124257280	2016-02-18T14:50:31	As a NBA fan, today is one of my favorite days of the year. 2016 Goal: finish my Trade Machine app and make an accompanying Slackbot.
noahchestnut	700118076428136448	2016-02-18T00:42:11	pang At a minimum, we need better data on people who start a longform, leave and come back to finish
noahchestnut	700117948694810624	2016-02-18T00:41:41	pang Many people don't treat words the same way. You don't pick up old New Yorkers on your phone
noahchestnut	700117750904008704	2016-02-18T00:40:54	pang One model I like is thinking about how Netflix produces high quality longform that new people discover months / years later
noahchestnut	700117486595760128	2016-02-18T00:39:51	pang But if they come from SMS or Email, that reader is far more likely to finish or at least make a good effort!
noahchestnut	700117314381873152	2016-02-18T00:39:09	pang People do read and finish longform on mobile, but it heavily depends on how they found it. If they tap from FB they rarely finish
noahchestnut	700117030607855616	2016-02-18T00:38:02	pang Fair! I rarely do in a single session either (I'm an avid Pocket/Insta paper user, so I'm a self selecting weirdo).
noahchestnut	700104154010660864	2016-02-17T23:46:52	pang Does the same person come back and read this in 7, 30, 60, 90... days? (sorry for starting this long thread with you, just came out)
noahchestnut	700103968374980610	2016-02-17T23:46:08	pang One great thing about news organizations who invest in dedicated mobile apps is that they are forced to think about user retention
noahchestnut	700103779018911744	2016-02-17T23:45:22	pang For many publications who rely on advertising, they are incentivized to publish longer stories that share to increase impressions
noahchestnut	700103618226188292	2016-02-17T23:44:44	pang But for those readers who bounce, they are still more likely to share longer reported-out stories and that creates a weird incentive
noahchestnut	700103438705635328	2016-02-17T23:44:01	pang I won't concede people don't read 'em, but it is true that many people sample and leave before reading.
noahchestnut	700087861354180608	2016-02-17T22:42:07	SeanBlanda I view this as another format alongside guilt and shame marketing 
noahchestnut	700060745107550208	2016-02-17T20:54:22	mccanner or when posting a photo to Instagram or writing a tweet...
noahchestnut	700060549984477184	2016-02-17T20:53:36	A constructive thing to do when writing a headline is to read it as if you'd stumbled across it on the Onion.   
noahchestnut	700048737578516480	2016-02-17T20:06:39	Max_Fisher asduner In other words, I don't open lots of tabs on my phone, but I will tap on a button / CTA at the end of something
noahchestnut	700048625338945538	2016-02-17T20:06:13	Max_Fisher asduner And re-reading this on mobile, the end of article list helps b/c I don't tap on URLs within the body on my phone

noahchestnut	700038737456041984	2016-02-17T19:26:55	eric_analytics So maybe the mobile goal isn't spelling but understanding words / improving my vocabulary?
noahchestnut	700038666983313408	2016-02-17T19:26:38	eric_analytics My favorite mobile "dictionary" type of feature is highlighting and looking up a single word on my Kindle.
noahchestnut	700038527732420610	2016-02-17T19:26:05	eric_analytics I'm the same way. With a full keyboard (desktop), I want to learn how to spell whereas with mobile I'm lazy with autocorrect

noahchestnut	700033013455806464	2016-02-17T19:04:11	Max_Fisher asduner I'd be curious to test: are users more likely to buy these books as liked in-text or as a list at the end?
noahchestnut	700030755636817920	2016-02-17T18:55:12	asduner And (adding Max_Fisher back), I'd love a "reading list" feature to end articles like this. Simple list of books + features?
noahchestnut	700030642264772609	2016-02-17T18:54:45	asduner Agreed! Also worth reading Rise of the Vulcans if you want to learn more.
noahchestnut	700011470621290497	2016-02-17T17:38:34	noahchestnut josephflaherty I'd be happy if Slack decided to fund an Office Space reboot as a streaming series.
noahchestnut	700010207124979712	2016-02-17T17:33:33	hunterwalk Kantrowitz Or... the fact that they have a looping video product called Vine. Did they test gifs v vine for d30 retention?

noahchestnut	700008367696191489	2016-02-17T17:26:15	bluechoochoo As well as a reasonable frustration with their own industry's legacy and failure to build these things first.
noahchestnut	700007519859507200	2016-02-17T17:22:52	bluechoochoo It's hard not to! I struggle with it.
noahchestnut	700005990448521216	2016-02-17T17:16:48	bluechoochoo Yeah. The comparison argument speaks to media Twitter's biases. I don't think most people make that argument.
noahchestnut	700004641602310144	2016-02-17T17:11:26	bluechoochoo Gif analytics = revenue for Giphy. What gifs should Twitter promote to boost retention? Giphy has search + share data.

noahchestnut	699053736077955073	2016-02-15T02:12:53	petersterne I love the Becker comparison. There is a whole culture to photo/video sharing that is still so nascent.

noahchestnut	699052094976868356	2016-02-15T02:06:21	petersterne Agreed, though I'd wager we prefer to express ourselves with words (by preference) so Twitter is a more natural fit.
noahchestnut	699051398328160257	2016-02-15T02:03:35	petersterne I've found sending the mundane / weird on Snapchat to one or two people has curtailed my tweeting.

noahchestnut	698649208153337856	2016-02-13T23:25:26	garyliu For sure. I don't think we are shouting from different sides of the room (sorry if I came across that way).
noahchestnut	698649050208473089	2016-02-13T23:24:48	garyliu People don't pay POLITICO to help them vote. They pay POLITICO because they work in politics / touched by $ in politics.

noahchestnut	698648832310173696	2016-02-13T23:23:56	garyliu To be honest, I view this as a problem beyond media. It touches education, government and a whole lot more.

noahchestnut	698648551086297088	2016-02-13T23:22:49	garyliu Well... need is complicated and can risk paternalism. I'd argue to start with what does media do?
noahchestnut	698648081177436161	2016-02-13T23:20:57	garyliu Are there any moments in history where we can honestly say people wanted to be exposed to difference via media?

noahchestnut	694249962251489281	2016-02-01T20:04:24	ElliotKort mccanner So I increasingly want a product that takes my podcast DVR and uses an algorithm to pull out the best clips.
noahchestnut	694236184969506816	2016-02-01T19:09:39	garyliu I find Facebook Messenger to be the best app for this

noahchestnut	694188661894569984	2016-02-01T16:00:49	smbriones And you also need to make sure that these Basecamp (or blog) threads aren't a replacement for critique.
noahchestnut	694188497096192001	2016-02-01T16:00:09	smbriones And the longer version: It is up to the designer (and PM) to clearly explain goals and metrics to limit the scope of the tread.
noahchestnut	694188155247808512	2016-02-01T15:58:48	smbriones The key is to be shipping on a regular basis so people are spending time with live code / prototypes and not picking apart mocks

noahchestnut	693084419624562689	2016-01-29T14:52:57	wyoumans Unlike YT or FB where you just tap and play, SC has trained users to actively watch by using their thumb to watch.
noahchestnut	693084254247321600	2016-01-29T14:52:17	wyoumans Ideally Snapchat will be able to give their producers/hosts granular data as to what specific clips people watch
