NKingofDC	705017463461830656	2016-03-02T13:10:36	Said this yesterday: Trump’s in a similar position in the delegate count to Romney in 2012. 
NKingofDC	705016504216129536	2016-03-02T13:06:47	Just noting that on Super Tues in 2012, Romney broke 40% in just three states: ID, MA and VA (in a two-person race against Ron Paul)
NKingofDC	704887915642494976	2016-03-02T04:35:49	Rubio excelled in areas with large numbers of white college graduates. He struggled elsewhere 
NKingofDC	704887942016344064	2016-03-02T04:35:56	It also went heavily for Santorum and Ron Paul in 2012. Romney was a distant third. A fickle process there.

NKingofDC	704834885148614656	2016-03-02T01:05:06	Maybe, but it's a big gap to overcome and others, like Kasich, will dilute the Rubio numbers up north.

NKingofDC	701209510468304897	2016-02-21T00:59:09	Rubio might just manage to win with another sub-2nd place finish, begging the question of whether you can win the nomination without winning
