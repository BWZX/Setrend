joshuafoust	722778609476210689	2016-04-20T13:27:03	It's weird how evidence that the Pentagon takes civilian casualties very seriously will be spun as the opposite 
joshuafoust	722777087275216897	2016-04-20T13:21:00	arangeroftexas Well, define "feasible"
joshuafoust	722776456581939200	2016-04-20T13:18:30	WardahHashmi evo8X8 There are a lot of tragedies that people upset by attention to Europe ignore when it's convenient
joshuafoust	722776116314767360	2016-04-20T13:17:09	arangeroftexas I believe Dyson rings would be primarily solar powered, since that is the purpose of constructing them
