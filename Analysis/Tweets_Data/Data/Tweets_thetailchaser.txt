thetailchaser	686654437004341248	2016-01-11T21:02:29	agurevich23 What do you mean? iS it a swap spread widening trade or a floater at T+15bp 7y with UST risk? Maybe I didnt understand.
thetailchaser	686646466568417280	2016-01-11T20:30:49	agurevich23 But I understand this from a Rates-centric view. Just dont think from a Global Macro perspective it is great.
thetailchaser	686646155590123522	2016-01-11T20:29:35	agurevich23 The vol of 7y sprds is what, 0.5-0.75bp/day? Perhaps I haven't been around that much! But 15bp for 7y holding not fantastic
thetailchaser	686642569737048064	2016-01-11T20:15:20	agurevich23 We're definitely getting used to low yields here, huh? ;)
thetailchaser	686640552406855684	2016-01-11T20:07:19	agurevich23 USTs + 40bp for 30y maturities isnt what I can a great yield enhancement, is it? You mean owning swap sprds or just fixed Lib?

thetailchaser	686315041323376640	2016-01-10T22:33:51	@strayreflect the issue is that periods of bonanza weren't met with rate hikes. Incentives all distorted as rates moved lower.
