MarcACaputo	715306706146836480	2016-03-30T22:36:23	AJDelgado13 CherylLynneRose right. You're arrested on a charge. You are then arraigned on a charge to see if the state proceeds.
MarcACaputo	715306556095643650	2016-03-30T22:35:47	CherylLynneRose AJDelgado13 police arrest you on a charge of a crime. They do this routinely w/out prosecutors. That happened yesterday
MarcACaputo	715306250733490176	2016-03-30T22:34:34	AJDelgado13 CherylLynneRose let me rephrase that: when you are arrested, it must be for a chargeable crime.
MarcACaputo	715305937146404865	2016-03-30T22:33:19	AJDelgado13 CherylLynneRose you need to be arrested on a charge of a crime in this country.

MarcACaputo	715304989070135297	2016-03-30T22:29:33	AJDelgado13 CherylLynneRose Cernovich ejsillycat it's not exactly true. Police charge battery all the time.

MarcACaputo	715304593484300288	2016-03-30T22:27:59	CherylLynneRose Cernovich AJDelgado13 ejsillycat wrong. Police charge people with battery all the time
MarcACaputo	715304347198992385	2016-03-30T22:27:00	AJDelgado13 CherylLynneRose Cernovich ejsillycat but the bar for actually taking this to trial is far higher than probable cause
MarcACaputo	715304203523133440	2016-03-30T22:26:26	AJDelgado13 CherylLynneRose Cernovich ejsillycat speculation is not evidence. This clearly meets (low) probable-cause standard.
MarcACaputo	715303945418186753	2016-03-30T22:25:24	AJDelgado13 Cernovich issue for the prosecutor is whether it's  1) beyond a reasonable doubt 2) winnable case 
MarcACaputo	715303585098113024	2016-03-30T22:23:59	AJDelgado13 Cernovich because they usually dont have:  1) video 2) audio 3) independent witness As noted today  1/2
MarcACaputo	715302779330363392	2016-03-30T22:20:46	AJDelgado13 Cernovich ejsillycat the more-difficult aspect of the case is whether to prosecute it. 2/2

MarcACaputo	709370208302080000	2016-03-14T13:26:51	3... The good news for a Marco Rubio, is there's still time. The bad news is he might be so far behind --and that's IF the polls are right
MarcACaputo	709369837890490368	2016-03-14T13:25:23	2... that's because many early/absentee voters have been converted from Election Day voters. So participation might not be increasing
MarcACaputo	709369646307287040	2016-03-14T13:24:37	1 But though a record 1.14m FL Rs have cast early/absentee votes in prez primary, we don't know if that means we'll have record Elex Day t/o
MarcACaputo	709368899897266176	2016-03-14T13:21:39	In the 2012 GOP prez primary, FL GOP cast 646k early/absentee votes.   As of this morning that number stood at 1.14 MILLION.
