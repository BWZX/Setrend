FionaMullenCY	716614980519403520	2016-04-03T13:15:00	Hasampouli CyprusNewsEu 9) so basically the whole article is half truths and provocative distortions
FionaMullenCY	716614848923049984	2016-04-03T13:14:28	Hasampouli 8)  the republic is borrowing at the lowest rate it has ever borrowed and has a good repayment schedule thanks to PDMO good work
FionaMullenCY	716614525974282242	2016-04-03T13:13:11	Hasampouli 7) his assertion that the government has 2bn of taxpayer money is an outright lie.
FionaMullenCY	716614402468741120	2016-04-03T13:12:42	Hasampouli CyprusNewsEu 6) the damages of the No vote led to the banks needing more capital reaching 9.4bn and Lilikas knows
FionaMullenCY	716613919222030336	2016-04-03T13:10:47	Hasampouli 6) the 9.4bn went to banks and not the government, and troika was clear that not a cent would go to banks
FionaMullenCY	716613717144641536	2016-04-03T13:09:58	Hasampouli 5) someone fucked up: republic needed just 7.3 bn, but calculation of mandarins of the ministry of economics + Christofias
FionaMullenCY	716613208392359936	2016-04-03T13:07:57	Hasampouli 4) a faster fall of debt to GDP would mean GREATER austerity which Lilikas is supposed to be against.
FionaMullenCY	716612953663938560	2016-04-03T13:06:56	Hasampouli 3) the debt to GDP was not 85% when the bailout happened, but 85% prior to the Laiki nationalisation, which he supported
FionaMullenCY	716612736122138624	2016-04-03T13:06:04	Hasampouli 2) none claims that the economy is in glorious shape but it is picking up in a way that is remarkable vs the banking crisis
