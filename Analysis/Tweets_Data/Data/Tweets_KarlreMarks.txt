KarlreMarks	719506894063329281	2016-04-11T12:46:25	FaheemHus shadihamid liberal values aren't the legal and constitutional framework but a socio-political driver. Big difference.
KarlreMarks	719506671316439040	2016-04-11T12:45:32	FaheemHus shadihamid finally, Shadi keeps getting wrong by speaking about 'liberal' values rather than secular democracy.
KarlreMarks	719506214531567616	2016-04-11T12:43:43	FaheemHus shadihamid and ultimately it leads to irrational and reactionary demands like blasphemy laws due to perceived incomparability
KarlreMarks	719505796384571392	2016-04-11T12:42:04	FaheemHus shadihamid and is more a product of the context that nurtures identity politics rather than anything intrinsic to Islam itself
KarlreMarks	719505548958437377	2016-04-11T12:41:05	FaheemHus shadihamid this stems more from the crisis of secularism/liberalism than an a-historic Muslim tendency not to fit in.
KarlreMarks	719505252022661120	2016-04-11T12:39:54	FaheemHus shadihamid Shadi thinks there's a continuity between historic Muslim experience and today which is far from obvious.
KarlreMarks	719505084233740288	2016-04-11T12:39:14	FaheemHus shadihamid also, it is a tension that exists in Arab countries, between secular and non-secular Muslims. Framing is wrong here.
KarlreMarks	719504894986731520	2016-04-11T12:38:29	FaheemHus shadihamid to frame this in terms of Muslim exceptionalism is utterly misleading, it is a global contemporary issue
KarlreMarks	719504621543276544	2016-04-11T12:37:24	FaheemHus shadihamid how to negotiate that tension between secular law and religious practices is still being contested there also
KarlreMarks	719504291598331904	2016-04-11T12:36:05	FaheemHus shadihamid good response but better comparison is with evangelical US Christians who are not a minority, pose similar problem

KarlreMarks	702477514707443712	2016-02-24T12:57:45	joshuadecter I'm totally against this piecemeal approach of individualised ethical actions. We need big politics, not guilt appeasement
KarlreMarks	702476983347838976	2016-02-24T12:55:38	joshuadecter anyway, sorry have to go into a meeting, but would be good to pick it up later. Lots to chew on.
KarlreMarks	702476848496771072	2016-02-24T12:55:06	joshuadecter intersections are fine, but what really matters is how those structures are created economically and politically.
KarlreMarks	702476312196333568	2016-02-24T12:52:58	joshuadecter I don't see the connection, you can say the same of football stars, do we expect them to reform the political landscape?
KarlreMarks	702476126782951424	2016-02-24T12:52:14	joshuadecter if we can't reimagine how we organise society we can't blame this on architects. Some are stars, most are not.
KarlreMarks	702475795390992385	2016-02-24T12:50:55	joshuadecter most of them are, endlessly repeating bland platitudes that everyone apparently subscribes to without real political drive.
KarlreMarks	702475462501670912	2016-02-24T12:49:36	joshuadecter it's a complete distraction to pursue the architects for this and evade the big questions about politics and economics
KarlreMarks	702475307861856262	2016-02-24T12:48:59	joshuadecter again, architects didn't bring this about. There more efficient ways of challenging this than architecture itself.
KarlreMarks	702474470955597825	2016-02-24T12:45:39	joshuadecter I find the fixation on architects bizarre given how the entire political landscape has changed over the last few decades
KarlreMarks	702474239987810304	2016-02-24T12:44:44	joshuadecter that is a political questions and the nature of the economy we want, not a matter for architects to decide.
KarlreMarks	702474040850714624	2016-02-24T12:43:57	joshuadecter arguably, we are much better today than historically when commissions were decided by rulers etc.
KarlreMarks	702473843030499328	2016-02-24T12:43:10	joshuadecter yes but nobody is deciding to build because of those architects, there are other considerations that dictate this.
KarlreMarks	702473255723134976	2016-02-24T12:40:50	typofoto I disagree. I think if you listen, you may learn something new, but if you talk you are only repeating what you already know
KarlreMarks	702472925279100928	2016-02-24T12:39:31	joshuadecter for example, back in the 60s similar ideas were being proposed for massive social housing.
KarlreMarks	702472672454819840	2016-02-24T12:38:31	joshuadecter architecture has no more choice than, say, dentistry. Capital allocation isn't down to architects
KarlreMarks	702472134304600064	2016-02-24T12:36:22	joshuadecter still on my list. But my point is architects don't make the socio-economic underpinnings of the world we live in

KarlreMarks	699963038745694208	2016-02-17T14:26:07	Look how smug he is about it as well! And his wife is so proud of her plagiarist husband. 
KarlreMarks	699961920535797760	2016-02-17T14:21:41	Amazing, this guy stole my Lebanese Monopoly and put his name on it! His wife says 'my hubby is a genius' 
KarlreMarks	699958828218114049	2016-02-17T14:09:23	I was surprised to hear there's a President's Day in the US. Because in the Arab world every day is the President's day.

KarlreMarks	699939061688102912	2016-02-17T12:50:51	Millions have shared the video of the survivalist opening the can with his bare hands. But what kind of a survivalist forgets a can opener?

KarlreMarks	699931711837245440	2016-02-17T12:21:38	Thanks to hipsters, we revived vinyl, typewriters, dungarees, mullets, beards, chequered shirts, hats, headphones and, now, the Cold War.
KarlreMarks	699926664856408065	2016-02-17T12:01:35	The paradox of our era is that it's the age of irony and literalism simultaneously.

KarlreMarks	699629379484315648	2016-02-16T16:20:17	UsmanBaghi that's universal I think
KarlreMarks	699622970591834112	2016-02-16T15:54:49	Way longer than that:  
KarlreMarks	699623611557089281	2016-02-16T15:57:22	I tell you why I prefer newspapers to online outlets: When I flip a newspaper, it doesn't take five minutes while all the crappy ads load up
KarlreMarks	699622357065994241	2016-02-16T15:52:22	Turkey has been threatening to invade Syria tomorrow for the past four years. Kind of weakening the power of the threat there.
