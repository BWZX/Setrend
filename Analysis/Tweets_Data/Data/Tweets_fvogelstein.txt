fvogelstein	725422023963332608	2016-04-27T20:31:02	rflax Geffen said he'd pay $2b for LAT in 06. Newsday sold for $650m post deal. Value Chi Trib at $750m and rest of papers at $600m=$4b
fvogelstein	725418858245312512	2016-04-27T20:18:28	rflax pmarca So this isn't the shining example of how crushed the newspaper business has been since '07? I want to be wrong here. Truly.
fvogelstein	725345291881177088	2016-04-27T15:26:08	rflax pmarca Corrected it immed. It's abt $4b to $800m, so 80% decline vs 90%. I truly wish that spoiled the narrative.
fvogelstein	724799344633733120	2016-04-26T03:16:44	fvogelstein Forgot abt tv assets. Means $4b to $800m poof, or 80%. Wish it changed my point. 16 yrs ago just Times Mirror was worth$8b.Ugh!
fvogelstein	724776608804958209	2016-04-26T01:46:23	How crushed is the newspaper business? Zell bought Tribune for $8b in '07. Gannett is offering 10% of that - $800m - for it today. Poof!
