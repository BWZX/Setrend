SPEEROTHEKID	713749677301047297	2016-03-26T15:29:18	You're kidding yourself if you think some of these guys don't make substantial income from subs - they most certainly do, as I just said

SPEEROTHEKID	713749190971514881	2016-03-26T15:27:22	I get people want to offset costs of business with reliable income, etc. They know the market doesn't provide that.
SPEEROTHEKID	713748987392577536	2016-03-26T15:26:34	For the record, I don't hate all "newsletters" and "premium subs". Just 99% of them. It just doesn't make sense to me.
SPEEROTHEKID	713748698283450368	2016-03-26T15:25:25	And btw, $120k/year seems great when you're retail &amp; not trading for a living. That's why they pitch you. It's shit with a substantial AUM.
SPEEROTHEKID	713748157050400770	2016-03-26T15:23:16	The guys pitching their bullshit - they're running a business the same way they trade: they sell to you at their lows.

SPEEROTHEKID	713747502365736960	2016-03-26T15:20:40	Spend said $120k/year on a lavish, "EASY" lifestyle and are now perpetuating the false reality of what it is to manage money
SPEEROTHEKID	713746913732898816	2016-03-26T15:18:19	It's so easy with ZERO risk. $100/mo with 100 subs is 120k a YEAR. Why would the moms basement "HF managers" even BOTHER risking trading?
SPEEROTHEKID	713746115036729344	2016-03-26T15:15:09	I've seen people on here say they'll "never sell out", right up until the point where they start pitching that juicy premium service
SPEEROTHEKID	713745604950646784	2016-03-26T15:13:07	are they really taking money out of the market, as advertised, at all? Do people not care about conflict of interest? (2/2)
SPEEROTHEKID	713745421487718402	2016-03-26T15:12:23	If someone's "business" is advertised as taking money out of the market, but their primary income is SELLING education (1/n)

SPEEROTHEKID	701873394481025024	2016-02-22T20:57:12	CoderTrader just depends how you define a "trend". a product continuously reverting seems like one of the most obvious trends available

SPEEROTHEKID	701867694698602497	2016-02-22T20:34:33	CoderTrader a trend is a continuous, consistent set of outcomes, a pattern. how is that not exactly what you doubly described?
SPEEROTHEKID	701866245524582400	2016-02-22T20:28:47	CoderTrader if something by nature continuously reverts to a value, how is that not a trend?
SPEEROTHEKID	701866105938247685	2016-02-22T20:28:14	CoderTrader trend: "a general direction in which something is developing or changing." - and you said "by nature" it reverts to a mean
SPEEROTHEKID	701865156888829952	2016-02-22T20:24:28	CoderTrader you literally defined a trend and then said there's a difference
SPEEROTHEKID	701865000307064832	2016-02-22T20:23:50	CoderTrader and something "by nature" as mean reverting doesn't seem like a trend to you? Lol
