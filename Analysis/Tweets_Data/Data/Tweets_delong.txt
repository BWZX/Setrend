delong	719523326079709184	2016-04-11T13:51:43	1/ One thing Slate declined to visit in its solid piece on the fight for NPR's future  is NPR's ideological future.
delong	719523632821755904	2016-04-11T13:52:56	2/ The house style at NPR is "he said, she said," an official stance of neutrality, and strict rules on hosts and reporters having any POV.
delong	719524031746203648	2016-04-11T13:54:31	3/ Why is no one asking whether THAT has a future? Well, it's easier to talk about young listeners, the podcast revolution and vocal fry.
delong	719524271203164160	2016-04-11T13:55:29	4/ A day will come when "some people say this, some say that, we have no idea who's right..." is no longer trust-making but trust-breaking.
delong	719524849991958528	2016-04-11T13:57:47	5/ To have any prayer of solving its ideological problem NPR has to not to care what Congress thinks because it's off federal $ completely.
delong	719525587761684480	2016-04-11T14:00:42	6/ Then NPR has to re-draw its doctrine of neutrality along two lines: rock solid commitment to fact checking and calling out untruths...
delong	719525944080404480	2016-04-11T14:02:07	7/ Instead of view-from-nowhere hosts and reporters + experts and outside voices, everyone is allowed to have voice but no one POV dominates
delong	719528966336458752	2016-04-11T14:14:08	8/ Not only at NPR but throughout mainstream journalism, the very idea that there can be — must be —ideological innovation has not dawned.
delong	719530221611982849	2016-04-11T14:19:07	9/ One problem with going all-in years ago on the devastating illusion that we have no ideology is: What happens when you have to change it?
delong	719532399386836992	2016-04-11T14:27:46	10/ Paradoxes abound. For example: no one critiquing viewlessness at NPR is without a view— me included. Makes it easy to dismiss critique.
delong	719533883117715456	2016-04-11T14:33:40	11/ It's almost impossible for those who've risen to the top of a professional practice to admit: somewhere along the way we lost the thread
delong	719535137172688897	2016-04-11T14:38:39	12/ And though this happened at NPR, there is zero chance of it being seen. So "young listeners and changing tastes" may be the only hope.
delong	719537364373278722	2016-04-11T14:47:30	13/ A huge handicap for NPR is an internal culture that does not encourage honest, freewheeling and public debate about frustrations at NPR.

delong	694910093427654656	2016-02-03T15:47:31	1) Academic and pundit realists love to say that they could fix American foreign policy, if only it were purely implemented.
delong	694910341868883968	2016-02-03T15:48:30	2) But it would *never* be purely implemented. It would be deeply, fundamentally corrupted to fit political realities.
delong	694910529576570882	2016-02-03T15:49:15	3) George W. Bush didn't follow neoconservative ideas perfectly (cf, support for Saudi Arabia). He couldn't.
delong	694910767284510720	2016-02-03T15:50:12	4) Realists play this double game where they judge liberalism and neoconservatism by results, then say their abstract policy paper is better
delong	694910967902265344	2016-02-03T15:51:00	5) Basically, all ideologies without access to power do this: they say compare their actually-existing opponents to their perfect ideal
delong	694911045798912000	2016-02-03T15:51:18	6) Of course, real politics doesn't work like that. You always get imperfect avatars working with political constraints.
delong	694911265869840384	2016-02-03T15:52:11	7) Realists, of all people, should be attuned to that. The irony is palpable.
delong	694911484397281280	2016-02-03T15:53:03	8) I bet this partly has to do with realism's actual track record. Do you really want to defend Henry Kissinger snuggling with genocidaires?
delong	694911934836121600	2016-02-03T15:54:50	9) So it's either "we're cool with Kissinger helping slaughter Bangladeshis" or it's Trump. President Ken Waltz isn't an option.
