ajjaffe	703046941937020928	2016-02-26T02:40:27	It's like Rubio's repurposed the same Christie playbook that damaged him—interjecting Trump to knock him off-balance.
ajjaffe	703046705407590401	2016-02-26T02:39:31	Rubio's turned his repetition gaffe from db8 into a standard joke on the stump and deploys it w/ease on Trump: "Now he's repeating himself."

ajjaffe	702616158516678658	2016-02-24T22:08:40	On call to donors, Bush apologized for the outcome of his campaign &amp; said he plans to help nominate a conservative: 
ajjaffe	702615175631917056	2016-02-24T22:04:46	Rubio's openly embracing being most voters' second choice:  Here's why:
