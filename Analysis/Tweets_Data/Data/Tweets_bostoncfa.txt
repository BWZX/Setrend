bostoncfa	725229942934528000	2016-04-27T07:47:47	Quiz--is this FB or LNKD? (Hint its the latter).  Twitter needs similar revamp of design. Still Impossible to use 
bostoncfa	725229090102513664	2016-04-27T07:44:23	Hate to say they need to copy FB buy they do.  There needs to be an easier way to comment on a tweet/ad.  LNKD did it, so should TWTR
bostoncfa	725228567810940928	2016-04-27T07:42:19	App ads have promise.  BUT biggest problem still engagement. On FB you kill twenty mins reading comments 
bostoncfa	725227317853839360	2016-04-27T07:37:21	This video ad caught my attention but still not relevant.  Is Twitter's ad algorithm busted? 
bostoncfa	725226280623431680	2016-04-27T07:33:14	A typical FB ad.  Seamless.  Engagement.  Shares.  People are curious.  TWTR ads are forced garbage. 
bostoncfa	725225602219913216	2016-04-27T07:30:32	Like how the hell is this ad relevant to me or anyone for that matter?  And the structure/design is horrendous TWTR 
bostoncfa	725225092788178944	2016-04-27T07:28:30	The other obvious problem is engagement.  Any relevant Facebook ad has many comments/likes, whereas typical Twitter ad is a ghost town. FB
bostoncfa	725224255579889664	2016-04-27T07:25:11	I think maybe because Twitter ads feel forced, desperate.  Facebook ads well integrated and supported by yours and friend's interests. TWTR
bostoncfa	725223705224351746	2016-04-27T07:22:59	I've never clicked on an ad on Twitter.  I've clicked on many on Facebook.  What are they getting wrong?
