robinhanson	726187125281034240	2016-04-29T23:11:17	For example, people are reluctant to endorse exile as replacement for prison, even if that is better, when they still see both as very bad.

robinhanson	720417858291761152	2016-04-14T01:06:16	trnsprttnst Cute, but seems one could skip the slimes and just have an explicit cost model.
robinhanson	720414603914510336	2016-04-14T00:53:20	trnsprttnst Which is why one needs to use a dataset to fit some cost parameters in a cost model.

robinhanson	720400461371559936	2016-04-13T23:57:09	trnsprttnst Alas, it seems a nice clear way to prove that the ancients were rationally cost-consciousness.

robinhanson	707999474656944128	2016-03-10T18:40:03	gwern But signs found at exits just as often as entrances. So sign suggests change, which suggests faster only if on slower than ave road.
robinhanson	707995098211033088	2016-03-10T18:22:39	erikbryn Yes, if there is no road, someone passing a marker may inspire more to join the road-builder, making road built faster.
robinhanson	707994673814630400	2016-03-10T18:20:58	erikbryn Right, though I had the slope in mind, that you go faster from peak down to valley, slower up toward peak.
robinhanson	707994480742424576	2016-03-10T18:20:12	erikbryn Yet another story is when we can put in effort and passing markers is more visible/publicized. We work harder just before marker.
robinhanson	707993949005283328	2016-03-10T18:18:05	erikbryn I agree one can make may different assumption sets. I was just considering real roads with real road markers.
robinhanson	707993223084564481	2016-03-10T18:15:12	erikbryn I was pondering what future progress one should infer after reaching a milestone, such as having a computer Go world champion.
robinhanson	707992760826126336	2016-03-10T18:13:22	Milestones are found more often at road valleys than at peaks, so reaching one tends to suggest slower, not faster, future progress.

robinhanson	706248828819632128	2016-03-05T22:43:36	tylercowen OK, but that's lecturing as a sign rather than a cause of change.
robinhanson	706241999427338240	2016-03-05T22:16:28	tylercowen Sure, but not necessarily via the direct channel of sanctimonious lectures persuading disaffected voters to not rebel.
robinhanson	706241232205275137	2016-03-05T22:13:25	JoshMorrison tylercowen Surely we have far more evidence on the effects of lecturing beyond the last week in this one case.
robinhanson	706232280872648706	2016-03-05T21:37:51	tylercowen Sure, that's more plausibly that attacks signal what forces are aligned where, instead of showing opinion effect of lecturing.
robinhanson	706231707930734592	2016-03-05T21:35:34	amelapay OK, but WHY did we evolve to find moral lecturing satisfying, if not for the image it creates about us?
robinhanson	706231490527399937	2016-03-05T21:34:43	heilun_chan FormerlyFormer Sure that makes more sense as analogy, but that's not the tone lecturing writers are taking these days.
robinhanson	706199070692515840	2016-03-05T19:25:53	Many are saying "but what else can we do?" Seems a case of "Something must be done. This is something. Thus this must be done." Bad argument
