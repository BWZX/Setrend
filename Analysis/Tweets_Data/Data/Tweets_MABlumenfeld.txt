MABlumenfeld	726136838201696257	2016-04-29T19:51:27	MileHighBrendan I guess my point is that you should be worried b/c of qualifications/temperament. Not because he's a paramilitary leader.

MABlumenfeld	726135763725856768	2016-04-29T19:47:11	MileHighBrendan And I think ultimately that you and I both know he is not Putin. He is loud, obnoxious, crass willing to say whatever...
MABlumenfeld	726135630678347777	2016-04-29T19:46:39	MileHighBrendan I'm saying that there's been a lot of insanity over his words. And actually more violence from the left than right over it.

MABlumenfeld	726101628772859909	2016-04-29T17:31:33	bloggingcaesar Exactly the same projection I have!
MABlumenfeld	726101041226387458	2016-04-29T17:29:13	morningmoneyben RameshPonnuru I'd put Utah at something like 51/36/10. Which is a total disaster of course.
MABlumenfeld	726100613252145152	2016-04-29T17:27:31	morningmoneyben RameshPonnuru Would turnout plummet in Utah? Most likely. And I think HRC would break Obama's 32%.
MABlumenfeld	726100536265695233	2016-04-29T17:27:12	morningmoneyben RameshPonnuru Yes. I know. But 18% of LVs saying "I would not vote" is not a result that shows up in Nov.
MABlumenfeld	726100287258267649	2016-04-29T17:26:13	morningmoneyben RameshPonnuru Mormons also don't care for libertarians. So no Gary Johnson surge. Constitution Party might get ~8-9%.
MABlumenfeld	726100083821928448	2016-04-29T17:25:24	morningmoneyben RameshPonnuru Humphrey got... 37%. Obama in 2008 was next best. At 34%.
MABlumenfeld	726099987977916416	2016-04-29T17:25:02	morningmoneyben RameshPonnuru  I mentioned this yesterday. Since LBJ's win, the best result for a Dem in Utah was by Humphrey.
MABlumenfeld	726099943648313344	2016-04-29T17:24:51	morningmoneyben RameshPonnuru I do not! But they most certainly will not vote Dem.
MABlumenfeld	726099671928721409	2016-04-29T17:23:46	morningmoneyben RameshPonnuru No, because that's a fantasy.
MABlumenfeld	726098829196562436	2016-04-29T17:20:25	morningmoneyben RameshPonnuru I give her AZ and come up with 358/180. Seems pretty locked in right there.
MABlumenfeld	726098162449047552	2016-04-29T17:17:46	morningmoneyben RameshPonnuru It's pretty predictable. HRC maybe, *maybe* puts AZ into play. Otherwise just give her O's 2008 minus IN.
MABlumenfeld	726097570737610752	2016-04-29T17:15:25	morningmoneyben RameshPonnuru If you genuinely game it out, the EV count ain't getting over 400 either.
MABlumenfeld	726095980500754432	2016-04-29T17:09:06	TheRickWilson RameshPonnuru morningmoneyben Goldwater loss was rather historic. More like 2008/1996.
MABlumenfeld	726095575670738944	2016-04-29T17:07:30	TheRickWilson RameshPonnuru morningmoneyben No. Probably more like Obama/McCain.

MABlumenfeld	726093696295391232	2016-04-29T17:00:02	michaelbd Condescension/smugness from any side is really grating. As if we're all not equally ignorant.
MABlumenfeld	726093341050437632	2016-04-29T16:58:37	michaelbd I mean, basically it says "Don't worry, the First Amendment still exists and you can say whatever. BUT..."
MABlumenfeld	726093187782184960	2016-04-29T16:58:00	michaelbd That said, I don't quite have the same reading. I think that whole paragraph is horrible.
MABlumenfeld	726092995662123009	2016-04-29T16:57:14	michaelbd Sincerely not nitpicking, but you should fix the typo then. "Divine precepts"

MABlumenfeld	726089040261447680	2016-04-29T16:41:31	EdAsante77 ThomasHCrown varadmehta Dramatic and rare. Generally it's about losing grip on the culture and being viewed as "bad."
MABlumenfeld	726088772027342849	2016-04-29T16:40:27	EdAsante77 ThomasHCrown varadmehta Not the wisest course of action for a journalist. I should know. BUT, that's the mob, yes.
MABlumenfeld	726088308640612352	2016-04-29T16:38:37	EdAsante77 ThomasHCrown varadmehta And this issue is not about folks getting fired. It's about feeling "left out/disrespected."

MABlumenfeld	726087962073653248	2016-04-29T16:37:14	EdAsante77 ThomasHCrown varadmehta Because "Average Joe" isn't a public figure. Entitled to expectation of privacy.
MABlumenfeld	726087793022263297	2016-04-29T16:36:34	EdAsante77 ThomasHCrown varadmehta Some random dude saying something bad and then it blowing up in the press would be far different.

MABlumenfeld	726053373963804672	2016-04-29T14:19:48	ThomasHCrown But that could be my own blindness. I did, after all, grow up in Crucial Waukesha County.
MABlumenfeld	726053300546756609	2016-04-29T14:19:30	ThomasHCrown Which yes I agree that these people are not *actual racists* But they *are* crass and not what I consider respectable people.
MABlumenfeld	726053065841868800	2016-04-29T14:18:34	ThomasHCrown And that's where this comes from. "I'm sick of being disrespected. I don't hate anyone! And yet I'm now a bigot!"
MABlumenfeld	726052898124234755	2016-04-29T14:17:54	ThomasHCrown I imagine that, despite that niceness, they'd still be widely viewed as bigots by leftists.
MABlumenfeld	726052793270865920	2016-04-29T14:17:29	ThomasHCrown And they're respectable while still having "wrong" opinions. In short, it's Wisconsin "nice."
MABlumenfeld	726052679491981312	2016-04-29T14:17:02	ThomasHCrown It's why Cruz destroyed him in Wisconsin. Folks practice that religion and are *respectable people.*
MABlumenfeld	726052560684105729	2016-04-29T14:16:34	ThomasHCrown Nominal. And, well, culturally ugly.
MABlumenfeld	726052436310384641	2016-04-29T14:16:04	ThomasHCrown But again, they are not respectable. Because they have "backwards" opinions/views.

MABlumenfeld	725418191204261890	2016-04-27T20:15:49	rcromwell4 Neal_Dewing Utter nonsense. I actually get it.  It's better than baseball. Way better.

MABlumenfeld	725412171467902976	2016-04-27T19:51:53	_Sweet_Lew varadmehta TheOneSoleShoe And "the establishment" kept them from having that. So burn it! Burn!

MABlumenfeld	725411620852211712	2016-04-27T19:49:42	_Sweet_Lew varadmehta TheOneSoleShoe Oh? I thought he was still "Cruz or nothing because nothing matters" camp.
MABlumenfeld	725410404776726529	2016-04-27T19:44:52	jaketapper Tom Delay's letter makes me want to throw a brick.   "He doesn't deserve what he's going through."   Unreal.

MABlumenfeld	725404177560641536	2016-04-27T19:20:07	WilcoxNMP NickWolfinger Curious as to whether this is actually the case. Self-reported after all...
