jasongay	726155255789047809	2016-04-29T21:04:38	jonahkeri anyway, very interesting subject and column. I'm going to go dope on cheese
jasongay	726154903073251328	2016-04-29T21:03:14	jonahkeri just never want those voices feel quieted
jasongay	726154846190092288	2016-04-29T21:03:01	jonahkeri I think we're on same side of street - my only worry is, long sad history of sports marginalizing those who condemned dopers
jasongay	726154562353111041	2016-04-29T21:01:53	jonahkeri devils advocate: do you really think one guy (even a star) has ability to erode Union position?
jasongay	726154286401478657	2016-04-29T21:00:47	jonahkeri which puts the sport in a weird place. But that's true of every sport. Hypocrisy baked into the formula! üëçüò≥üòÄüòÄ
jasongay	726154138434854915	2016-04-29T21:00:12	jonahkeri and to be clear: I think baseball has made up mind about doping which is: they kind of sort of care, and fans don't care
jasongay	726153690395082752	2016-04-29T20:58:25	jonahkeri but I think it's natural the two can get conflated
jasongay	726153626826190849	2016-04-29T20:58:10	jonahkeri I don't want to mix apples and oranges - I know you're saying it from Union standpoint, not antidoping standpoint
jasongay	726153492772065284	2016-04-29T20:57:38	jonahkeri but that's the kind of "watch what you say" thing which is exactly the kind of omert√† that's been so pervasive in doping culture
jasongay	726152928352997377	2016-04-29T20:55:24	jonahkeri johnsonray84 and omert√† is a disaster that never serves anyone in the long run
jasongay	726152721821241344	2016-04-29T20:54:34	jonahkeri johnsonray84 like verlander. Dissent can't be discouraged. I worry what's been encouraged here is tantamount to omert√†
jasongay	726152404580876288	2016-04-29T20:53:19	jonahkeri johnsonray84 JK I get what you're saying about Union solidarity but one thot: Union protection should also apply to critics...

jasongay	694182966440894464	2016-02-01T15:38:11	If amateurs willing to spend $3K on wheels, anything possible. And to someone deprived of ethics, motor probably preferable to doping
jasongay	694182774119501824	2016-02-01T15:37:25	It's also foolish to think this is the 1st bike with a motor. It's also assumed there are a lot on the Fondo scene. Think about it
jasongay	694182230088904704	2016-02-01T15:35:15	That doesn't diminish the very real accomplishments of cyclists who are doing it the right way, who have every right to be annoyed.

jasongay	694181811442880512	2016-02-01T15:33:35	This is what you *want* UCI to do: not ignore it. The fact that they caught a motor is good. And it should be publicized.
jasongay	694181643616133121	2016-02-01T15:32:55	And it'd be foolish to think it's only on fringes. UCI was testing at Giro and the Tour last year. They'd heard the chatter. (Or hum)
jasongay	694181369568718848	2016-02-01T15:31:50	I don't think this is epidemic/sport-crushing crisis. But it's a BIG deal because its a nutty thing. First caught was always going to be big
