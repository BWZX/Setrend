emilybell	696080028870844416	2016-02-06T21:16:26	emilybell To say, "Twitter's problem is growth" conceals a whole world of assumptions. And somewhere in that world is... Twitter's problem.
emilybell	696079443127877633	2016-02-06T21:14:06	Donna_Howell Venice311 it is peerless for news journalism. And jokes. For everything else it is trounced by FB

emilybell	696075307162464257	2016-02-06T20:57:40	BrettPFarrell it is a safer environment. It is slower, more enclosed, less hazardous. People like living in the suburbs....
emilybell	696074753900199944	2016-02-06T20:55:28	dannysullivan same....though my son isn't a Twitter shareholder either
emilybell	696070820339322880	2016-02-06T20:39:50	If Twitter grew it would mean millions more people wanted to broadcast to the world, with all the exhilaration and hazard that entails...
emilybell	696070046112731136	2016-02-06T20:36:46	heyitsnoah BenedictEvans if you can't make money out of 400m people and Amber calling out Kanye...then you're a news company
emilybell	696069797331787776	2016-02-06T20:35:46	Twitter's problem - people say - is growth. But Twitter's purpose and design, as the world's most efficient broadcaster, is self limiting
emilybell	696067294003384320	2016-02-06T20:25:49	Messaging is an exciting part of the future of news: The New York Times’ new Slack 2016 election bot  HHConnect
emilybell	696065335368224768	2016-02-06T20:18:02	BenedictEvans if it wants higher active users it really has to be not Twitter....which given its design is unlikely to work
emilybell	696064898355298304	2016-02-06T20:16:18	BenedictEvans I take your point, on users, but Twitter imo has to have *higher* ARPU because of what it is....like others in news industry
emilybell	696064604275920896	2016-02-06T20:15:08	BenedictEvans so, it can never grow like FB because it isn't FB. It is easy to find people to follow but hard to participate with safety
emilybell	696064310909472768	2016-02-06T20:13:58	BenedictEvans but maybe that's because Twitter by its nature is self limiting. It is the world's newswire. Public, raw, useful, hostile
emilybell	696060639400349697	2016-02-06T19:59:23	adebradley have you tried using Snapchat recently?  :)
emilybell	696060401340059648	2016-02-06T19:58:26	adebradley otoh there are *so many* devs in platform companies, many of them haven't . Remember FB 'timeline'?
emilybell	696059861122052099	2016-02-06T19:56:17	adebradley I don't think finding people to follow is difficult. I do think posting is nerve wracking and the environment unpredictable
emilybell	696059322430787584	2016-02-06T19:54:09	MunibaKamal tiny number...also appealing to Brits. Big crowds make us nervous
emilybell	696059138414092289	2016-02-06T19:53:25	'Following' is not Twitter's problem. Neither is functionality. Monetizing existing users is its problem.

emilybell	695831869821157376	2016-02-06T04:50:20	Yes. So, in fairness, is 'BuzzFeed' 
emilybell	695804177998598144	2016-02-06T03:00:18	One more positive thought: Twitter's algorithm could tune out harassment via ML, instead of putting onus on human blocking/reporting

emilybell	685438318054649856	2016-01-08T12:30:04	peterjukes paulconnew1 ok but isn't this an dramatic passage in UK politics? Presentation of story is secondary to fact of situation
emilybell	685437880760709121	2016-01-08T12:28:20	peterjukes paulconnew1 bbcdp (sorry for being dense ) but what is the point about Pol Ed's authority?
emilybell	685437479063797760	2016-01-08T12:26:44	peterjukes paulconnew1 ...if they knew but waited for an official statement from the party or for ITV /Sky then what would narrative be?
emilybell	685437177195565056	2016-01-08T12:25:32	peterjukes paulconnew1 if you have X thousand journalists not doing journalism then you do have a problem...
emilybell	685435811433693184	2016-01-08T12:20:06	peterjukes paulconnew1 ok but are you suggesting same presentation (albeit a bit cack handed) wouldn't be applied to Tory resignation?
emilybell	685435328887439360	2016-01-08T12:18:11	peterjukes paulconnew1 Why are you worried? This is a really dramatic story in UK politics, isn't it?
emilybell	685433810276773888	2016-01-08T12:12:09	peterjukes fact of a certain amount of cackhandery speaks to lack of practice maybe, but is the alternative streaming press announcements
emilybell	685433187137384448	2016-01-08T12:09:41	peterjukes the BBC has always sought impact for stories...just hasn't broken many of them recently.

emilybell	685423447091077120	2016-01-08T11:30:58	The BBC broke a (true) news story and people want the journalist to resign for doing so? Get a grip everyone.
