nicolas_veron	723528010578681856	2016-04-22T15:04:54	Right. But the real problem in the Eurozone is the risk concentration (home bias), not zero risk-weighting.

nicolas_veron	723182709028192256	2016-04-21T16:12:48	Above the "soft exposure limit", there would be a schedule of capital charges that increase with exposure and effectively deter home bias.

nicolas_veron	723181603258662912	2016-04-21T16:08:24	Best &amp; simplest way to reduce home bias is what current jargon calls "soft exposure limits" on banks' holding of any country's sov. debt.

nicolas_veron	723180922569269248	2016-04-21T16:05:42	Thus, the eurozone needs specific action to reduce its banks' home bias, while leaving the risk-weighting debate to the Basel Committee.
nicolas_veron	723180407978528768	2016-04-21T16:03:39	Much of the rhetoric is about sovereign debt risk-weighting, but the real challenge for the eurozone is home bias (aka large exposures).
