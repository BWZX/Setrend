hhavrilesky	725717249890217984	2016-04-28T16:04:10	When people get stiff &amp; weird because they want some lowest common denominator, watered down you-imitating-yourself thing, question that.

hhavrilesky	725382452567371776	2016-04-27T17:53:48	Because modern life is a montage that says "Risk nothing, care less, close your eyes," you will need repeated reminders to do the opposite.

hhavrilesky	723927214530555905	2016-04-23T17:31:12	But when you admit that you care way too much, often the pain lifts more quickly, or you’re able to coexist with pain &amp; feel some joy, too.
hhavrilesky	723927056585617410	2016-04-23T17:30:34	When you try very hard not to care so much, you tend to stay in an exhausted, invested, painful, conflicted state for a long time.

hhavrilesky	723924848167161856	2016-04-23T17:21:48	JackieNooner Sometimes that exhaustion comes from half-trying to feel the pain while also running away from it.

hhavrilesky	717155572047458304	2016-04-05T01:03:07	MattWelch Basart just coined the term "San Franciscbro" over dinner. INTERNATIONAL HERO.
hhavrilesky	717147280873095170	2016-04-05T00:30:10	meghan_daum This is how the common she-beast unwinds btw. 
hhavrilesky	717136688057724929	2016-04-04T23:48:04	meghan_daum shorterstory helaineolen Jeeeeesus.
hhavrilesky	717136558915096576	2016-04-04T23:47:34	Awl I only celebrate good things in private, because I am dignified and discreet.
hhavrilesky	717109157334228992	2016-04-04T21:58:41	MattWelch I know. But we were talking about me. WE ALWAYS ARE. WAKE UP.
hhavrilesky	717101393098575872	2016-04-04T21:27:49	MattWelch But look what I did right there. Some people are never grows up, Matt.
hhavrilesky	717101247275241472	2016-04-04T21:27:15	MattWelch Honestly I think I was more sober than usual because baby &amp; was doubting myself because not enough boozy overconfidence.
hhavrilesky	717100565549846528	2016-04-04T21:24:32	MattWelch But Basart is probably just drunk.
hhavrilesky	717100478404829184	2016-04-04T21:24:11	MattWelch SO right. What a bore. The only two people who disagree are American hero Bill Sandoval and international hero Ken Basart.
hhavrilesky	717099709802741760	2016-04-04T21:21:08	MattWelch I remembered that and thought, "Matt was right, I am boring and self-involved. I should've listened more closely to him."
hhavrilesky	717099582224609281	2016-04-04T21:20:38	MattWelch That's weird bec. just today I was remembering that wedding reunion where you said to me, "It's not all about you, you know."
hhavrilesky	717099305031434241	2016-04-04T21:19:32	MattWelch Did you tell the fan how fucking obnoxious and unlikable I am in real life?
hhavrilesky	717098931457363968	2016-04-04T21:18:02	That said, I am obnoxious and not always likable, therefore not the ideal test case

hhavrilesky	717094373213609984	2016-04-04T20:59:56	meaghano This is a definitely a thing. "I mildly enjoyed your piece but was gratified to discover that people hate you a lot."

hhavrilesky	717093414597079040	2016-04-04T20:56:07	joshgondelman That's fucked. And I don't even think "I loved it but the comments, whew!" is a completely unconflicted response.

hhavrilesky	717092599455035392	2016-04-04T20:52:53	But smart people are too afraid of angry commenters to do that. SIGH.
hhavrilesky	717092523793997824	2016-04-04T20:52:35	I wish smart people wrote more about things that suck these days, so we didn't have to turn to angry commenters for this service.
hhavrilesky	717092093424848896	2016-04-04T20:50:52	Before that I wrote for a place called , which was about how almost all of the stuff out there sucks hard.
hhavrilesky	717091794832351232	2016-04-04T20:49:41	When people say "OMG did you read the mean comments?" I want to say "I wrote for Salon. My skin is thicker than the Great Wall of China."

hhavrilesky	714497445795725312	2016-03-28T17:00:40	Be polite &amp; patient (even when you're pissed off) is another golden rule. Make it easy on your overworked editor.

hhavrilesky	695307426229153792	2016-02-04T18:06:23	People think they have to be strong, admired, successful, to find love. But openly owning up to your own patheticness works pretty well too.

hhavrilesky	695303319246344192	2016-02-04T17:50:04	notyourpalley THANK YOU! Glad to hear it!
hhavrilesky	695303125763170304	2016-02-04T17:49:17	If she's strong and outspoken and the marriage works, that means he's obviously weak and bullied and less than a man. Such horse shit.

hhavrilesky	684151135670636545	2016-01-04T23:15:16	jendeaderick Clearly you need to have the "When you do things for me that I could easily do myself, I feel much, much more loved" talk.
hhavrilesky	684150787983851521	2016-01-04T23:13:53	Strongly recommend subscribing to TDO! Other magazines pile up. The Desert Oracle is read &amp; savored immediately!

hhavrilesky	684149046441713664	2016-01-04T23:06:58	This is v. helpful 
hhavrilesky	684148719344685056	2016-01-04T23:05:40	taffyakner Why don't you take a little rest and put your legs up or take a nap or have a drink you prolific typety typing motherfucker?
hhavrilesky	684147703115194368	2016-01-04T23:01:37	KenLayne Spent some time explaining the words "excessively realistic baby doll" to my kids. They were intrigued.
hhavrilesky	684112915905916928	2016-01-04T20:43:24	vrabincha Thank you! So glad you liked it.
hhavrilesky	684006735502127105	2016-01-04T13:41:28	vrabincha Wow, I've never met anyone from there. Such a strange little town that time forgot, but then haven't been there in a decade.
hhavrilesky	683853518273298432	2016-01-04T03:32:38	movandy Thank you!
hhavrilesky	683460961324240896	2016-01-03T01:32:45	vrabincha Your dad grew up there?
hhavrilesky	683162197904637953	2016-01-02T05:45:35	j_zimms Yep that's accurate. But I'll bet I have terrible blind spots,  too. SIGH.
hhavrilesky	683044199004938240	2016-01-01T21:56:42	j_zimms Yes, if you mean these problems are viewed and analyzed in high def but never really eliminated!
hhavrilesky	682997956950097921	2016-01-01T18:52:57	sfreynolds Gee thanks! Love the column. 6/2/70 = MADNESS. Maybe 11 am? Will find out.
hhavrilesky	682997503709462529	2016-01-01T18:51:09	Pillownaut Yep, can't win. But supernatural youth is treated as the only way to stay human-ish.
hhavrilesky	682994229136637952	2016-01-01T18:38:08	bill_e_wheeler Very high degree of difficulty there
hhavrilesky	682396326781399040	2015-12-31T03:02:17	Intensely flattered to be in EW's 2016 book preview alongside alexanderchee, hhavrilesky, csittenfeld &amp; others: 
hhavrilesky	682350253895372800	2015-12-30T23:59:12	If carrieffisher is the face of "aging badly," please dear Lord let me age badly, too.
hhavrilesky	682349797286653953	2015-12-30T23:57:23	If women who get surgery are celebrated as "aging well" &amp; women who don't are derided as "aging badly" guess what our daughters will do?
hhavrilesky	682292052499939328	2015-12-30T20:07:56	CAAF This dog is a superstar.
hhavrilesky	682291032382255105	2015-12-30T20:03:53	kurthartwig rivetingpics Thanks for the recommendation!!
hhavrilesky	682289355734396928	2015-12-30T19:57:13	kurthartwig No! I believe it, though. Will check it out.
hhavrilesky	682288716539236352	2015-12-30T19:54:40	Yeah carrieffisher, why don't you do SOMETHING ELSE like write some books or a screenplay or ok wait hold on... 
hhavrilesky	682288007722872832	2015-12-30T19:51:51	One tiny last thing, never ever see a movie in January or February. That's where they put the terrible movies.
hhavrilesky	682287710787121152	2015-12-30T19:50:41	Elijah_Meeks HAHAHA
hhavrilesky	682286667365879808	2015-12-30T19:46:32	willyblackmore bake shit?
hhavrilesky	682286515691454464	2015-12-30T19:45:56	Thus concludes my Hour of Outrage. Tune in next week for "Masking Tape, What Is It Good For?"
hhavrilesky	682285819583840257	2015-12-30T19:43:10	And Captain America's buddy is in danger? What apocalyptic movie hellscape is this?
hhavrilesky	682285586443403265	2015-12-30T19:42:14	And X-Men Apocalypse looks terrible. The look of it alone, so tacky and busy and neon ugly. mattbuchanan was right.
hhavrilesky	682284393218494464	2015-12-30T19:37:30	DrewHart8 Sorry meant "sorta oldish older than before me"
hhavrilesky	682284216776667136	2015-12-30T19:36:48	victoriaedel WE DO DESERVE IT YOU'RE RIGHT
hhavrilesky	682283986857545728	2015-12-30T19:35:53	When your agent calls and says "This movie is like Heaven Is For Real meets Humpty Dumpty," that must feel not so good.
hhavrilesky	682283727653744640	2015-12-30T19:34:51	OMG and that Jennifer Garner movie trailer with the kid who has a bad fall and chats with God then all her bad illness goes away, wow.
hhavrilesky	682283288703062016	2015-12-30T19:33:06	Related: The idea that once you're a (female) parent, all you do is wring your hands over your kids, and have no other purpose in the world.
hhavrilesky	682282972557381632	2015-12-30T19:31:51	chang_koo Yes, I agree. It's just unfamiliar, to all of us, young &amp; old. We never see regular non-smooth faces onscreen, so it's unnerving.
