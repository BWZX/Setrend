LadyFOHF	725295561524559872	2016-04-27T12:08:31	joshuafsmith081 TheDomino Not all hedge funds invest in equities. Not all HFs are fundamentally driven.

LadyFOHF	725293604206436352	2016-04-27T12:00:45	joshuafsmith081 TheDomino so the model evolves. I don't think we disagree.

LadyFOHF	725256452630298624	2016-04-27T09:33:07	nicolatheron So pretty logical to stay out until post-vote in that instance. PE closes and RE raise can slip a month or so.

LadyFOHF	725253952569262082	2016-04-27T09:23:11	nicolatheron And given most are looking at RE and PE type assets, there could be an impact longer term. A two-month delay seems prudent.

LadyFOHF	722773079206858752	2016-04-20T13:05:05	OddsLot Massively. Some of the seed deals I've seen recently have been almost prohibitively expensive.
LadyFOHF	722768541804597248	2016-04-20T12:47:03	SamTyfield It's finessing it from both sides, agreed. But as assets attract assets it sort of makes sense if things have stagnated.
LadyFOHF	722767506293841920	2016-04-20T12:42:56	SamTyfield If they have been told they need to be at $150 to get interest and once there they get no interest that's the risk they take
LadyFOHF	722767292388519936	2016-04-20T12:42:05	SamTyfield The point being it gets them over the AUM threshold to raise assets from other allocators in that three year period.
LadyFOHF	722766725633081345	2016-04-20T12:39:50	OddsLot Capital is expensive. Not really resume writing though. They still have to get out and raise assets.

LadyFOHF	722756855366356993	2016-04-20T12:00:37	SamTyfield mostly not because these are funds substantially set up and running with a track record and just no traction on assets.

LadyFOHF	722361981148262400	2016-04-19T09:51:31	JonnyVolTrader I've seen a decent number of interesting pieces on it, which extend beyond googling random statistics.
LadyFOHF	722361805700526081	2016-04-19T09:50:49	JonnyVolTrader Seriously? Your analysis is 'google it', combined with 'common sense and intutition'.
LadyFOHF	722361527236501504	2016-04-19T09:49:43	JonnyVolTrader without saying why you think the veto was valid in each case and why not getting it was damaging the point makes no sense.
LadyFOHF	722361237288415232	2016-04-19T09:48:34	JonnyVolTrader You are the one asking 'how many' as if there is a quantitative basis to your view. I'm just making enquiries.
LadyFOHF	722360787197693952	2016-04-19T09:46:47	JonnyVolTrader and yet you are asserting that you're sure it's damaging. Do you seriously believe you can use it in a realistic argument?
LadyFOHF	722360581014032384	2016-04-19T09:45:57	JonnyVolTrader so you have no analysis you're willing to share, but you're sure it's better than everyone else's.
LadyFOHF	722360249538187266	2016-04-19T09:44:38	JonnyVolTrader Tell me how many and the negative ¬£ impact on trade each rejection of the veto has had.
LadyFOHF	722359785698508800	2016-04-19T09:42:48	.JonnyVolTrader you're relying on 'intuition and common sense'. I'm going to look for more analytical resources to base decisions on.
LadyFOHF	722359583516278788	2016-04-19T09:42:00	JonnyVolTrader I am aware of the structure of the EU. You've not yet provided analysis or genuine statistics to support anything.

LadyFOHF	722358830126997505	2016-04-19T09:39:00	JonnyVolTrader  What incentive do the trade counterparties have to give a better deal? Agreements are bilateral. You don't just ask and get
LadyFOHF	722358327448092672	2016-04-19T09:37:00	JonnyVolTrader This is opinion. Not analysis.
LadyFOHF	722357988191793152	2016-04-19T09:35:39	JonnyVolTrader But agreements are bilateral. Again, why is anyone incentivised to give us a better deal just because we asked?
LadyFOHF	722357801272680448	2016-04-19T09:34:55	JonnyVolTrader Faster than what? Who is incentivised to give us terms that 'suit the British economy' better?
LadyFOHF	722357141189894144	2016-04-19T09:32:17	JonnyVolTrader So we carry on buying their stuff but they don't buy ours...?

LadyFOHF	716742267084611584	2016-04-03T21:40:47	RobinWigg because if you are a US-domiciled fund with non-US investors an offshore feeder is the most efficient way for them to allocate.
