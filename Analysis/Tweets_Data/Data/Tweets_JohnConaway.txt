JohnConaway	721867469283926017	2016-04-18T01:06:30	Flavor or burger was good. Fresh lettuce, toms not so fresh, no bite/stringy. Overall flavor is good, poor assembly &amp; distribution tho
JohnConaway	721867024574484480	2016-04-18T01:04:44	Patty was small relative to bun. It just seems like a burger with grilled bun &amp; weak thousand island dressing. Bun was soggy &amp; flat

JohnConaway	716121168269324288	2016-04-02T04:32:46	WestEgg_Capital But again look longer first. Longer TF supersedes, there may be stronger confluence &amp; symmetry here 
JohnConaway	716120538800717824	2016-04-02T04:30:15	WestEgg_Capital I kinda see what you're saying if it does swing up into resistance how much will it retrace back to try a long (1)
JohnConaway	716119612367056896	2016-04-02T04:26:35	WestEgg_Capital Personally, I wouldn't like that same method in muck. NFLX had somewhat of a trend, GS doesn't.

JohnConaway	716111631034376193	2016-04-02T03:54:52	WestEgg_Capital Totally get it! I've done the same, and learn from it. It helps me to define overall structure, then small goals within
JohnConaway	716111144704815105	2016-04-02T03:52:56	WestEgg_Capital You're taking steps, it's about continuation not finishing. I hope to never finish.
JohnConaway	716110899816173573	2016-04-02T03:51:57	WestEgg_Capital There's absolutely value in these talks for me, too.

JohnConaway	716109759137472512	2016-04-02T03:47:25	WestEgg_Capital The main structure on the chart is probably basing or just muck. Higher Or wider TF needed here, else, next vehicle
JohnConaway	716109408955006976	2016-04-02T03:46:02	WestEgg_Capital My thought is the swing high is off the chart to the left. Swing low is on bottom of chart (from what I can see).
JohnConaway	716108733919531008	2016-04-02T03:43:21	WestEgg_Capital So you think it breaks back down through that flag?

JohnConaway	716103297229275136	2016-04-02T03:21:45	WestEgg_Capital If you wait for a swing high then you're looking for a retrace lower. Back to the books üòä
