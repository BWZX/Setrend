juliebosman	725719372468224000	2016-04-28T16:12:36	Chilling, sobering, saddening. The judge brings the Hastert case to an end.  
juliebosman	725547961468522496	2016-04-28T04:51:28	In 14 yrs as a reporter, I've never heard a beat down quite like the one given to Dennis Hastert. Read it here. 
juliebosman	725415656766758912	2016-04-27T20:05:44	The extraordinary Hastert hearing: a sentencing for an obscure financial crime turns into a forum on sexual abuse.

juliebosman	725367640273895425	2016-04-27T16:54:56	Judge's final words before exiting: "This is a horrible case.. horrible for our country. I hope I never have to see a case like this again."
juliebosman	725367437240229889	2016-04-27T16:54:08	Judge, on Hastert: "I will allow him to self-surrender."
juliebosman	725367026676420609	2016-04-27T16:52:30	Dennis Hastert, former Speaker of the House, is sitting motionless as he is sentenced to 15 months in federal prison.
juliebosman	725366813022928896	2016-04-27T16:51:39	Judge: I am also sentencing Hastert to two years of supervised release.
juliebosman	725366641433792512	2016-04-27T16:50:58	Judge: I am sentencing the defendant to 15 months incarceration.
juliebosman	725366225535139845	2016-04-27T16:49:19	Here we go. Judge: "The defense wants me to impose a sentence of probation. Any sentence of straight probation would be inappropriate."
juliebosman	725365844109328384	2016-04-27T16:47:48	Judge: I spoke to the warden of a BoP facility, who assured me that "the defendant's health needs will be met if he is incarcerated."
juliebosman	725365612080431111	2016-04-27T16:46:53	Judge, who has not yet said whether Hastert will serve prison time, says that BoP is well equipped to care for inmates with health issues.
juliebosman	725364711349469184	2016-04-27T16:43:18	Judge reminds courtroom again of extraordinary fact: Hastert called Tom Cross, brother of one of his abuse victims, asking for his support.
juliebosman	725364377113653248	2016-04-27T16:41:58	Yes, Hastert is 74, says the judge. But "he’s not an infirm, helpless, handicapped senior citizen who is unaware of what’s going on."
juliebosman	725363777869348864	2016-04-27T16:39:35	Judge, on Hastert: "If there’s a public shaming of the defendant because of the conduct he’s engaged in, so be it."
juliebosman	725363490819559428	2016-04-27T16:38:27	Judge, praising Scott Cross for testifying on Hastert's sexual abuse: "I believe everything Mr. Cross said."
juliebosman	725363003365937154	2016-04-27T16:36:31	Judge to Hastert: Any sentence I give you today would "pale" to what you would have received in state court for committing sexual abuse.
juliebosman	725362740928364544	2016-04-27T16:35:28	Judge tells Hastert that he is especially aggravated that someone with Hastert's education and background would commit these crimes.

juliebosman	725361572227502081	2016-04-27T16:30:50	Judge talks about how the 1970's were different from today. Back then, he said, can you imagine accusing "the town hero of molesting you?"
juliebosman	725361311375314944	2016-04-27T16:29:47	Judge, on Hastert: "Some actions can obliterate a lifetime of good works," calling him a "serial child molester" for the third time.
juliebosman	725360753381937153	2016-04-27T16:27:34	Sidenote: Hastert's lawyer has removed his glasses, keeps covering his eyes with his hand, and is staring downward. Does not look pleased.
juliebosman	725360343732604928	2016-04-27T16:25:57	Judge blasts Hastert for trying to "set up" Individual A, actions that were "intentional, thought out, and desperate."
juliebosman	725359838901972993	2016-04-27T16:23:56	Judge, to Hastert: "You manipulated the FBI and the U.S. attorney’s office. And that’s a big problem for you."
juliebosman	725359622903713792	2016-04-27T16:23:05	Judge says that typically, structuring violations result in little to no prison time. "This case is different from those cases," he said.
juliebosman	725359190781341697	2016-04-27T16:21:22	Judge says Hastert's lying to the FBI was "deplorable," especially "by a person who knew better."
juliebosman	725358878150500352	2016-04-27T16:20:07	Judge recounting Hastert's actions in a brusque tone. Repeatedly calls him a liar and child molester. "You lied, and here we are."
juliebosman	725357329194045440	2016-04-27T16:13:58	Judge, on Hastert: "What rational person takes out $1.7 million in cash from a bank" over several years?
juliebosman	725356728137711616	2016-04-27T16:11:35	Judge, in a sharp tone: Hastert's cash withdrawals were a crime, his explanations to the FBI for his actions were "preposterous."
juliebosman	725356012518182912	2016-04-27T16:08:44	Judge, on Hastert: "The defendant is a serial child molester."
juliebosman	725355613182676994	2016-04-27T16:07:09	Judge Durkin is moments away from naming Hastert sentence. Says he has discretion to vary above or below the federal guidelines.
juliebosman	725354151056695296	2016-04-27T16:01:20	The judge asks Hastert if he sexually abused Mr. Cross, who testified today. Hastert: "I don’t remember that, but I accept his statement."
juliebosman	725353745844977664	2016-04-27T15:59:44	Hastert apologizes to the victims; his family; to the court; to the people of the United States.
juliebosman	725353509537894402	2016-04-27T15:58:47	Hastert:"I am sorry to those I have hurt and misled. What I did was wrong and I regret it. They looked to me and I took advantage of them."
juliebosman	725353242599821312	2016-04-27T15:57:44	Hastert: "For 11 months, I have been struggling to come to terms with events that occurred almost 40 years ago."
juliebosman	725353126933463040	2016-04-27T15:57:16	"I am deeply ashamed to be standing before you today," Hastert says. "I mistreated some of athletes that I coached."
juliebosman	725352949828956162	2016-04-27T15:56:34	Hastert unsteadily rises from his wheelchair, preparing to speak. He is using his walker to approach the lectern.
juliebosman	725352819767791616	2016-04-27T15:56:03	Hastert atty asks for probation and, if necessary, home confinement.

juliebosman	725351748223832064	2016-04-27T15:51:47	Throughout 45-minute hearing so far, Hastert has remained seated, hands clasped together, staring at the ground. He has spoken three words.

juliebosman	725342634626154496	2016-04-27T15:15:34	"Don’t be a coward, Mr. Hastert," Ms. Burdge says. "Tell the truth. What you did wasn’t misconduct. It was sexual abuse of a minor."
