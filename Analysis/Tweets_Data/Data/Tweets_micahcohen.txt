micahcohen	705615920845221888	2016-03-04T04:48:39	BrendanNyhan OK, now this tweet is making me think I MUST be wrong 
micahcohen	705615608260509696	2016-03-04T04:47:25	Serious Q: How SHOULD the media cover this candidate? 
micahcohen	705615065689559040	2016-03-04T04:45:16	BrendanNyhan totally fair, but there's little precedent for Trump too
micahcohen	705614876518064128	2016-03-04T04:44:30	BrendanNyhan yeah, but i guess that's my point: They don't have a path outside of rendering Trump toxic -- beyond toxic, really
micahcohen	705614367430205440	2016-03-04T04:42:29	micahcohen BrendanNyhan it doesn't make sense ... particularly because they spent the first 119 min of debate savaging Trump
micahcohen	705614206595256320	2016-03-04T04:41:51	BrendanNyhan I think we've gotten enough evidence that Trump's supporters aren't going anywhere. If that's Rubio/Cruz's plan ...
micahcohen	705609036830515201	2016-03-04T04:21:18	Rubio/Cruz's refusal to say they won't support Trump if he's nominee is baffling -- undermines everything else they're saying.
