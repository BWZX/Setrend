davidmcw	725967784853803008	2016-04-29T08:39:42	davemcginn_ie nah to the tinder angle or applying critical thought in Ireland to Brexit?
davidmcw	725965595640913920	2016-04-29T08:31:00	Shane_Conneely markets way too complacent on this one....not for the first time!!:):)
davidmcw	725965208712155136	2016-04-29T08:29:28	Brexit. If the EU and UK were on Tinder, who'd swipe right first? Just a thought. Maybe an article?

davidmcw	725959926816755712	2016-04-29T08:08:28	In fact maybe re Brexit our self interested position should be pro Brexit pro-EU?? Two apparently different things can be true!
davidmcw	725958860863770624	2016-04-29T08:04:14	Shane_Conneely yeah but no evidence that UK economy will slow just different components of growth
davidmcw	725956838357762048	2016-04-29T07:56:12	If Brexit is really as calamitous of FDI in UK as Remain says- we'd be winners. Shouldn't self interest imply Ireland for Brexit?Thoughts?
