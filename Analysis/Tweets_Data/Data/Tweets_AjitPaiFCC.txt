AjitPaiFCC	709784341002461186	2016-03-15T16:52:28	12) Telling that despite agreement on little else, a powerful, bipartisan group of lawmakers sharply questions FCC's policy/fidelity to law.
AjitPaiFCC	709784079647023112	2016-03-15T16:51:26	11) Senators say FCC "ignored bipartisan concerns" on JSAs; are "extremely disturbed" by agency "bypass[ing]" law. 
AjitPaiFCC	709783716353155073	2016-03-15T16:49:59	10) This led to an extraordinary March 11 letter from bipartisan group of Senators, led by RoyBlunt &amp; DickDurbin. 
AjitPaiFCC	709783603094425600	2016-03-15T16:49:32	9) This includes the Entravision JSA--the very agreement FCC promised would not be affected!  
AjitPaiFCC	709783464623661056	2016-03-15T16:48:59	8) FCC's response? To pursue policy anyway--in merger context. Existing JSAs must be unwound before deals OK'd, regardless of recent law.
AjitPaiFCC	709783231915270144	2016-03-15T16:48:04	7) In Dec 2015, massive majority of both Houses passed a law ordering FCC to grandfather existing JSAs. Here it is. 
AjitPaiFCC	709782789655293953	2016-03-15T16:46:18	6) Many Democrats voiced concern re: FCC's actions. See letter from SenatorBarb, SenSchumer, SenGillibrand, more. 
AjitPaiFCC	709782493239631872	2016-03-15T16:45:08	5) In 2014, FCC told Congress explicitly that Entravision JSA wouldn't be harmed. Pp 45-46:
