Redistrict	722621227173478400	2016-04-20T03:01:40	Ted Cruz's "New York value:" ZERO delegates.
Redistrict	722620326807347200	2016-04-20T02:58:06	If it weren't for Utica, Trump would likely also leak a delegate in NY22, but blue-collar Utica is definitely a Trump town (56.8%).
Redistrict	722618962681311236	2016-04-20T02:52:40	Now it looks almost certain that Trump will be just under 50% in Albany's NY20, so dial up another Upstate delegate for Kasich.
Redistrict	722617187844931589	2016-04-20T02:45:37	Yea but Bernie is getting his revenge by winning Clinton County, 74-26 
Redistrict	722616877646635013	2016-04-20T02:44:23	Insult to injury: Hillary beating Bernie in the East Village, 3,695 to 3,577. 
Redistrict	722616399261077505	2016-04-20T02:42:29	Donald Trump's own neighborhood (Trump Tower) is one of the few in NY where he's under 50%. Kasich's best neighborhood (UES) nearby.
Redistrict	722614741361799169	2016-04-20T02:35:54	It also looks quite likely that Kasich will "steal" a delegate from Trump in Albany's NY20, but most of Albany Co. still hasn't reported.
Redistrict	722612919284813824	2016-04-20T02:28:40	With Syracuse (Onondaga County) almost all reported, it looks very likely that Kasich will win at least one delegate Upstate, in NY24.
Redistrict	722611292641607680	2016-04-20T02:22:12	redistrict Keep in mind he may finish in second in at least one of those...
Redistrict	722611201864126464	2016-04-20T02:21:50	Delegate update: to my eye, only 7 CDs where Trump could fall under 50%. That means Trump will claim between 88 and 93 of NY's 95 delegates.
Redistrict	722610012380528640	2016-04-20T02:17:07	Districts where Trump appears in jeopardy of falling below 50%: NY07, NY10, NY12, NY13, NY20, NY21, NY24. All others look clear.
Redistrict	722607668393676800	2016-04-20T02:07:48	Much like Zephyr Teachout in 2014 Dem Gov primary, Bernie likely to carry majority of NY's counties but get blown out statewide.
Redistrict	722606885438754816	2016-04-20T02:04:41	There's a possibility Trump will end up under 50% in NY24 (Syracuse), but Wayne County hasn't reported &amp; could easily put him over 50%
Redistrict	722605765848997888	2016-04-20T02:00:14	To add perspective to Trump's 82% Staten Island blowout: with 90% of precincts reporting, Dem votes outnumber GOP votes 28,149 to 21,999.
Redistrict	722604409708875776	2016-04-20T01:54:51	I think JohnKingCNN just called Ulster a "tiny rural county." Quite a few people in Kingston, NY might disagree.
Redistrict	722603918539104256	2016-04-20T01:52:54	Perspective: Donald Trump winning 82% on Staten Island w/ 16,748 votes. In November 2012, Obama won Staten Island w/ 78,181 votes.
Redistrict	722603365251698688	2016-04-20T01:50:42	Very few places across NY where Trump is under 50% right now: Manhattan, Syracuse, Ulster/Warren/Lewis counties. That's about it.
Redistrict	722602030770954240	2016-04-20T01:45:24	Ted Cruz doing very well w/ Orthodox Jews (Borough Park, South Williamsburg, Crown Heights). But that could still add up to zero delegates.
Redistrict	722600604351090688	2016-04-20T01:39:44	Huge GOP divide between elites &amp; everyone else: Trump weakness seems pretty much confined to Manhattan, he's crushing it everywhere else.
Redistrict	722600119711830016	2016-04-20T01:37:48	So much for Cruz push in the Bronx: Trump looks very likely to be over 50% among tiny pool of GOP voters in NY15. rottenboroughs
Redistrict	722599475152195585	2016-04-20T01:35:14	It looks clear that Trump is on track to be under 50% in at least NY10: Cruz strong in Borough Park, Kasich strong in Lower Manhattan.
Redistrict	722598611976998912	2016-04-20T01:31:48	Cruz beating Trump in Borough Park 55%-39%: 
Redistrict	722597751926599685	2016-04-20T01:28:23	Breaking: the Democratic presidential primary is still over.
Redistrict	722596245345288196	2016-04-20T01:22:24	Clinton sweeping Manhattan, much of white liberal Brooklyn. This is not Bernie's night. 
Redistrict	722596242505633792	2016-04-20T01:22:24	It's early, but Kasich winning Manhattan 46%-42%. Could that mean Kasich could steal 2/3 delegates in several districts?
Redistrict	722593341486080000	2016-04-20T01:10:52	CNN exit backs out to Trump 57, Kasich 26, Cruz 16.

Redistrict	709817925172109312	2016-03-15T19:05:55	This is just crazy

Redistrict	709817673983643648	2016-03-15T19:04:55	A murky 3/15 outcome could keep NeverTrump forces divided over strategy, whereas a big Trump win could ^ Indie drive while still feasible.

Redistrict	709800001044545536	2016-03-15T17:54:42	Chris Cillizza at the Fix could hardly be more mistaken w/ this headline. IL, MO &amp; NC matter. 
Redistrict	709792367910334464	2016-03-15T17:24:22	The only red state where Trump &amp; Cruz have combined for less than 60% of the vote? South Carolina (in part bc so many were still in race).
Redistrict	709787622298746880	2016-03-15T17:05:31	The only places where Trump+Cruz have taken less than 50%? New Hampshire, Vermont &amp; DC:

Redistrict	709786393959075842	2016-03-15T17:00:38	Here's how badly the GOP "Establishment" is getting its ass kicked: 
Redistrict	709785182887407617	2016-03-15T16:55:49	Kasich &amp; Rubio have combined for a paltry 28.2% of vote so far, despite owning 72% of endorsement points: 
Redistrict	709784166582321152	2016-03-15T16:51:47	My latest: The GOP's Establishment ‘Lane’ May Have Always Been A Dead End 
Redistrict	709782536214462468	2016-03-15T16:45:18	Taking a step back: In contests held so far, just 5.1% of all eligible voters have cast votes for Donald Trump. 5.9% for Hillary Clinton.
Redistrict	709774990292467717	2016-03-15T16:15:19	If Cruz pulls off an upset in MO &amp; comes close in IL, odds of contested convention would rise dramatically. OH less of an indicator.
Redistrict	709774088903008256	2016-03-15T16:11:44	If Trump wins ALL 26 IL/MO CDs &amp; 121 delegates, he's probably unstoppable even w/ OH loss. If Cruz wins at least a third, good sign for him.
Redistrict	709773384356274176	2016-03-15T16:08:56	IL/MO may tell us more than FL/OH tonight. Here's why: Cruz won't win FL/OH, but # of IL/MO CDs won will test long haul viability vs. Trump.
Redistrict	709771406519738368	2016-03-15T16:01:04	What would you guess is Kasich/Trump breakdown of this subset? 
Redistrict	709762460874629124	2016-03-15T15:25:32	Fact check: technically false. If Kasich were to win all 1,264 remaining delegates, he'd be at 1,327 delegates. 
Redistrict	709724353978605568	2016-03-15T12:54:06	Trump’s coalition of GOP voters is different yet very similar to previous GOP nominees 
Redistrict	709624561113833472	2016-03-15T06:17:34	That's a very fair point. Tho even independent of rules, total Trump/Cruz % much higher in red states than blue. 
Redistrict	709623254399356928	2016-03-15T06:12:22	So far, Ted Cruz &amp; Donald Trump have won 87% of all delegates from red states, just 60% from blue. Calendar starts getting much bluer 3/15.
Redistrict	709531765002469376	2016-03-15T00:08:49	Exactly. While press obsesses over Rubio in FL and Kasich in OH, Cruz's 3/15 focus has been strategic &amp; smart.  
Redistrict	709530783078219776	2016-03-15T00:04:55	Perhaps just as telling as FL &amp; OH tomorrow: how many of IL &amp; MO's 26 congressional districts does Cruz steal from Trump?
Redistrict	709528815576350720	2016-03-14T23:57:06	Don't sleep on Illinois and Missouri — they could help make Trump unstoppable:

Redistrict	709451553392955392	2016-03-14T18:50:05	Right now, Sanders needs to win 54.1% of remaining pledged delegates to tie Clinton. If delegates split evenly tmw, he'll need 55.5%.

Redistrict	709441329919434752	2016-03-14T18:09:28	if Trump wins IL solidly, he could claim most CD delegates. IF NOT, he could lose a few Chicago CD's to Kasich &amp; Downstate CD's to Cruz.
Redistrict	709434682270584832	2016-03-14T17:43:03	Pet peeve: IL &amp; MO often dismissed as "proportional" GOP states. Not true: could functionally become winner-take-all a la SC.

Redistrict	704905092303069184	2016-03-02T05:44:05	Yes, which isn't good news for Ted Cruz. Victory doesn't equal a big delegate lead out of OK. 
Redistrict	704904060420415488	2016-03-02T05:39:59	Cruz ranged mostly in the 40s in most Texas CDs. Cleared 50 in one so far, TX01, Louie Gohmert's. Matters for delegate allocation
Redistrict	704903613055967232	2016-03-02T05:38:12	I just don't see why UpshotNYT has Rubio anywhere near 150 delegates, but I'm open to persuasion. 
Redistrict	704902726174556161	2016-03-02T05:34:41	If Rubio does indeed win several GA congressional districts, I could see how he hits 100 delegates tonight, but not many more.
Redistrict	704901449432604672	2016-03-02T05:29:36	Where are CDs Rubio is winning dels (other than MN)? Looks like AR02 GA04 GA05 GA06 OK01 OK05 TN03 TN05 TX30 TX32...others?
Redistrict	704897641042350080	2016-03-02T05:14:28	Rubio's loss of VA is no big deal, costs him only one delegate. His failure to make thresholds in other states is far more costly.

Redistrict	704896284000444420	2016-03-02T05:09:05	Quick delegate projections: Trump is on track for 262 delegates, Cruz for 215, and Rubio for 93.  SuperTuesday
Redistrict	704896271618871297	2016-03-02T05:09:02	Not if he's finishing 3rd in most of those 36 districts. Please show me a TX district where Rubio is running 2nd.  
Redistrict	704891242748968960	2016-03-02T04:49:03	Every Rep. and Sen. up for renomination tonight won their primaries even as Trump, Cruz rolled 
Redistrict	704895140738043906	2016-03-02T05:04:32	Based on the rules and the results, we have good reason to believe these UpshotNYT estimates are way off.  
Redistrict	704893559753801728	2016-03-02T04:58:15	Alabama is 100% in and Rubio is only at 18.5%. He gets no statewide delegates
Redistrict	704893622777487361	2016-03-02T04:58:30	Tonight's even more awful for Rubio than I thought. By my math, he'll end up 100+ delegates behind Cruz, 200+ behind Trump in total count.
Redistrict	704893002813149190	2016-03-02T04:56:02	My back of the envelope delegate projections: Trump 262, Cruz 215, Rubio 93. Think something's wrong w/ UpshotNYT: 
Redistrict	704887915642494976	2016-03-02T04:35:49	Rubio excelled in areas with large numbers of white college graduates. He struggled elsewhere 
Redistrict	704887510317600768	2016-03-02T04:34:13	JayCostTWS I'd guess he gets more.
Redistrict	704887349130498048	2016-03-02T04:33:34	Rubio was a Kasich-less Virginia away from a 'good' night, even though that would have netted him just one more delegate. Politics is screwy
Redistrict	704887337172525056	2016-03-02T04:33:32	Finally, a state where Rubio's 20% threshold bid is going better: Tennessee. He's now at 20.8% with 95% precincts reporting.
Redistrict	704886019984785409	2016-03-02T04:28:17	Kevin Brady gets a little more room. Now at 52% v Steve Toth at 39 percent. With 57 percent of precincts reporting.
Redistrict	704885998749147138	2016-03-02T04:28:12	Rubio DOES look likely to come in 2nd in Georgia. He's down 0.2% to Cruz, but most outstanding precincts are in Fulton/Gwinnett.
Redistrict	704885463073554432	2016-03-02T04:26:05	In most southern CDs, third place gets you ZERO delegates. That's how awful this night could become for Marco Rubio.
Redistrict	704885142242861057	2016-03-02T04:24:48	Forecast Models Could Be Underestimating Cruz's Final Delegate Margin Over Rubio 
Redistrict	704884772213022722	2016-03-02T04:23:20	If Rubio's short of TX's 20% threshold, he'll be ~90 dels behind Cruz in TX alone. But it gets even worse for Rubio in other southern CDs.
Redistrict	704884403051298818	2016-03-02T04:21:52	For a few reasons, I'm not so sure about UpshotNYT model that projects ~250 Trump delegates, ~180 Cruz, ~135 Rubio. 
Redistrict	704879522274025472	2016-03-02T04:02:28	If Cruz is winning 90 TX delegates to 0-2 for Rubio, and winning 2nd place in other southern CDs, he'll win 100+ more delegates than Rubio.
Redistrict	704879083688226816	2016-03-02T04:00:44	This GOP delegate projector may be underestimating the final delegate gap b/t Cruz and Rubio, b/c of CD allocation. 
Redistrict	704873894331727872	2016-03-02T03:40:06	Bad sign for Rubio 20% in TX: in handful of counties I've checked, he's doing WORSE w/ E-Day voters than early. Most counted so far = early.
Redistrict	704872460294946816	2016-03-02T03:34:25	Let's crowd-source this: in TX, any indications Rubio is doing better with E-Day votes than early votes? 
Redistrict	704869440538742785	2016-03-02T03:22:25	Inconveniently for Rubio, his two best non-VA southern states are Arkansas and Oklahoma, which only have 15% thresholds. Rest have 20%.
Redistrict	704866587111768064	2016-03-02T03:11:04	Trump wins tonight, BUT probably not by so much that anti-Trump R's start drafting Indie alternative. New game: stop him from 1,237.
Redistrict	704864345264500736	2016-03-02T03:02:10	Redistrict yes. but i think it’s still a bad night for Rubio either way
Redistrict	704864166662807552	2016-03-02T03:01:27	First MN results: Rubio 33%, Cruz 28%, Trump 22%. Very early &amp; Rubio better hope it holds, otherwise headline from tonight is awful.
Redistrict	704863776827432964	2016-03-02T02:59:54	True. But, they are pro-outsider and looked unpredictable. Also possible many skipped down-ballot races.  
Redistrict	704863102773403648	2016-03-02T02:57:14	Interesting: Trump voters not lashing out at R congressional incumbents. Shelby wins in AL, all R incumbents looking good in TX.
Redistrict	704862264210264065	2016-03-02T02:53:54	Texas Tribune calls TX29 for Gene Green.
Redistrict	704862204307382273	2016-03-02T02:53:39	Rubio likely to get few to no delegates in Texas as he is below 20 pct threshold
Redistrict	704861902728519682	2016-03-02T02:52:27	Rubio Is In Danger Of Missing Key Delegate Thresholds In Several States 
Redistrict	704861610037354496	2016-03-02T02:51:18	Rubio looked great in VA to start out, but night's looked pretty terrible for him ever since. He better hope MN salvages his night.
Redistrict	704860130492456960	2016-03-02T02:45:25	Thanks to TX, OK &amp; thresholds, Cruz could end up w/ a much higher delegate count than Rubio despite winning comparable % of votes.
Redistrict	704859903207346177	2016-03-02T02:44:31	Rubio's current %s in states w/ 20% thresholds: 15.7% in AL, 21.9% in GA, 19.5% in TN, 18.8% in TX, 19.6% in VT. Ouch!!
Redistrict	704855357890433029	2016-03-02T02:26:27	Most positive sign for Rubio so far: he's winning bigger in Whole Foods counties than he did in Feb contests. But, not great overall.
Redistrict	704851359418478592	2016-03-02T02:10:34	Rubio couldn't be cutting it closer on the delegate thresholds. He's at 19 in Alabama, 21 in Georgia, 19 in Tennessee, 20 in Texas
Redistrict	704851777829670912	2016-03-02T02:12:14	The more the night progresses, the better it looks for Ted Cruz. Wins in TX &amp; OK keep him in race, currently 2nd in AL/GA/TN too.
Redistrict	704850563155017728	2016-03-02T02:07:24	If Ted Cruz wins Texas and Oklahoma, on what planet does he leave the race?
Redistrict	704850567689080832	2016-03-02T02:07:25	As Rubio speaks, he's below the 20% threshold needed to win statewide delegates in Tennessee and Texas. Would be salt in the wound tonight.
Redistrict	704848654620876800	2016-03-02T01:59:49	A lot depends on whether Rubio does better w/ Election Day voters than early in TX. He's doing ok w/ early, will E-Day get him above 20%?
Redistrict	704848314219565056	2016-03-02T01:58:28	The closer I look, going to be a very close call as to whether Rubio hits 20% threshold in TX. Good numbers in burbs, not good in rural.
Redistrict	704846172201025536	2016-03-02T01:49:57	NBC just called VA for Trump, but state board of elections reporting about 7k more votes for Rubio than AP. Trump's win will be narrow.
Redistrict	704844513097998336	2016-03-02T01:43:21	Rubio's prospects for hitting TX's 20% threshold looking quite good early on. So far, good night for him, just okay for Trump.
Redistrict	704843586995679234	2016-03-02T01:39:41	Trump up 35.7% to 31.3% over Rubio w/ 74% reporting in VA. But, most remaining votes in Northern VA. Rubio on track for VERY narrow loss.

Redistrict	704841934779633664	2016-03-02T01:33:07	In a shocking rejection of President Jerry Falwell, Jr.'s endorsement, Trump takes FOURTH PLACE (7%) at Liberty U.: 
Redistrict	704839580063809536	2016-03-02T01:23:45	In Alexandria City, professional home of many GOP consultants: Rubio 47, Kasich 23, Trump 19, Cruz 8
Redistrict	704838663440568320	2016-03-02T01:20:07	Nov. 2012: Romney won 3,120 to 153 at Liberty U. Today's VA primary: Rubio 513, Cruz 387, Carson 162, Trump 90 (!!!)
Redistrict	704838100187484160	2016-03-02T01:17:53	Whoa: Donald Trump has won just SEVEN % in Liberty U.'s precinct in Lynchburg, VA? So much for Jerry Falwell, Jr. 
Redistrict	704836799378661377	2016-03-02T01:12:42	Important note here: all of Liberty U. is in one precinct. Don't know if that monster precinct has reported yet. 
Redistrict	704835464990224385	2016-03-02T01:07:24	It looks like Virginia Beach might save Donald Trump from a loss to Rubio in VA. He's up 38%-30% there, an important battleground.
Redistrict	704834965989695488	2016-03-02T01:05:25	Trump back up 37%-30% over Rubio with 46% reporting in VA. Not looking like a Rubio win, but will still be closer than expected.

Redistrict	704834207781163009	2016-03-02T01:02:24	Decent sign for Trump: he's losing VA's burbs overall but doing well in southern Hampton Roads, carrying Chesapeake/Suffolk.
Redistrict	704833096487714816	2016-03-02T00:58:00	Be cautious of Trump's 36%-32% lead over Rubio in VA. Once more of Northern VA reports in, going to be REALLY close.
Redistrict	704832279504404480	2016-03-02T00:54:45	At this rate, there is a small chance Rubio could pull off a huge Virginia upset, *IF* Fairfax County comes through for him.
Redistrict	704831346741518338	2016-03-02T00:51:02	Rubio's 46%-19% lead over Trump in Inside-the-Beltway VA precincts is by far his best showing *anywhere* to date. 
Redistrict	704830103625338881	2016-03-02T00:46:06	Rubio currently beating Trump 45%-19% in inside-Beltway VA08. That's by far his best showing so far in any primary. 
Redistrict	704829344166895616	2016-03-02T00:43:05	To my eye, it looks like Rubio on track to finish within 5% of Trump in VA. But, could be even closer. Still early, we'll see.
Redistrict	704827669620396033	2016-03-02T00:36:26	Be cautious of Trump's 39%-29% lead in VA so far. Most of that is from western VA, but not a lot of Rubio-friendly Northern Virginia yet.
Redistrict	704827129876324352	2016-03-02T00:34:17	So far, Trump taking 54% in Southwest VA's VA09 to 18% Rubio, 17% Cruz. But, very little of vote-rich Northern VA reported yet.
Redistrict	704826624374657024	2016-03-02T00:32:16	Great sign for Rubio: he's leading 42%-29% in Henrico County, now leading 40%-28% in Chesterfield. 
Redistrict	704825422610112513	2016-03-02T00:27:30	Hanover County, perhaps the Tea Party HQ of VA, giving Trump an early 39%-26% lead over Rubio, 23% for Cruz. Not bad for Rubio.
Redistrict	704824866432802816	2016-03-02T00:25:17	So far, positive signs for Rubio in VA. Probably won't win, but looks like he will keep it fairly close with Trump.
Redistrict	704824629265895424	2016-03-02T00:24:21	I think there's an AP reporting error on the Dem side in Buchanan, though. No way four precincts have produced a 984-51 Hillary lead.
Redistrict	704824211529924608	2016-03-02T00:22:41	Will admit, I wrote my UVA admissions essay on Buchanan County. Voted Dem as recently as 2004, now a prototypical Trump zone.
Redistrict	704823945577496576	2016-03-02T00:21:38	Trump taking 64% in coal bastion of Buchanan Co., VA so far. Totally expected. Rubio holding his own in Fauquier, Chesterfield (exurbs).

Redistrict	694357009693564928	2016-02-02T03:09:46	Rubio's performance in Iowa 
Redistrict	694356211978870784	2016-02-02T03:06:36	Now pretty safe to say that Ted Cruz has won the Iowa Caucuses. Trump the favorite for 2nd place, but strong Rubio showing.
Redistrict	694352011366543360	2016-02-02T02:49:54	At this point, it may be that Rubio has a better shot of edging out Trump for 2nd than Trump has of edging out Cruz for 1st. Amazing.
Redistrict	694350864685887488	2016-02-02T02:45:21	At the moment, the balance of evidence points is consistent with both a very high turnout and a narrow Cruz victory.
Redistrict	694351091568250880	2016-02-02T02:46:15	Surprise, surprise! Ted Cruz on track to win Iowa caucuses. Not a done deal, but Q is: where does Trump make up deficit? Not obvious.
Redistrict	694350320340611072	2016-02-02T02:43:11	Ted Cruz has an excellent chance to win this thing tonight. So far, looks like a pollingfail
Redistrict	694350066622996480	2016-02-02T02:42:10	Rubio showing some muscle as bigger precincts begin reporting. Uptick to 21% statewide fueled by new leads in Davenport, Dubuque, Iowa City.
Redistrict	694349253729095680	2016-02-02T02:38:57	Bernie's biggest lead is in Iowa City, 15% over Hillary. But that's perhaps not as huge as expected, and lots of Hillary-friendly Polk left.
Redistrict	694347560853438464	2016-02-02T02:32:13	Hillary's lead looks small, but gonna be tough for Bernie to make up 3% deficit. There aren't any Bernie "blowout" areas so far.
Redistrict	694346823578685442	2016-02-02T02:29:17	The big ?? counties: on the GOP side, Dallas (Des Moines burbs) and Dubuque still outstanding. On Dem side, lots of urban Iowa left.
Redistrict	694343793479254016	2016-02-02T02:17:15	Looks like we could be headed for much closer finishes on both GOP and Dem sides than the entrance polls suggested. Grab some popcorn.
Redistrict	694343352859275264	2016-02-02T02:15:30	This is s brutal stat  
Redistrict	694342230744543232	2016-02-02T02:11:02	Surprise: Rubio so far winning not only Sioux but O'Brien, both in Bob VanderPlaats land. But, struggling in his best expected areas.
Redistrict	694341183980568577	2016-02-02T02:06:53	One ominous sign for Rubio: so far he's not hitting 20% in places that should be great for him: Scott, Polk, Johnson. Still early.
Redistrict	694340188370255872	2016-02-02T02:02:55	The first results are in from famously evangelical/conservative Sioux County. And the GOP leader so far by 6 votes is...Rubio? Hmm...
Redistrict	694338198152036353	2016-02-02T01:55:01	Rubio had better hope these early results are from tiny, rural precincts. So far he's in mid-teens%. Perhaps big caucus sites better for him
Redistrict	694337444951543808	2016-02-02T01:52:01	First few precincts from Lyon Co. (NW IA) give Cruz 41% of vote for 20% each to Trump and Carson. Cruz probably hoped to do even better.
Redistrict	694334104477630464	2016-02-02T01:38:45	Key counties for Cruz: Sioux, Mahaska, Warren. Key for Rubio: Polk, Dallas, Scott. Key for Trump: ??? Let's find out.
Redistrict	694333243831689216	2016-02-02T01:35:20	As HotlineJosh points out, disappointing for Cruz is that he's tied with Trump among college grads at 22%. Needs to do better to win.
Redistrict	694332687847280640	2016-02-02T01:33:07	One of the most promising signs in the entrance poll for Rubio is college graduates: 28% Rubio, 25% Trump, 20% Cruz.
Redistrict	694327802582044673	2016-02-02T01:13:42	MSNBC: 43% of GOPers 1st-timers, higher than 38% in 2012 - good for Trump? Evangelicals 62%, up from 57% in 2012 -- good for Cruz?
