morningmoneyben	724616220541095936	2016-04-25T15:09:04	Basically if Trump wins Indiana it's pretty much over and he gets 1237+ with likely California win.
morningmoneyben	724615969847517184	2016-04-25T15:08:04	But just because the deal is simple in math terms doesn't mean it will work. Kasich camp would have to tell Indiana voters to vote Cruz.
morningmoneyben	724615649138499584	2016-04-25T15:06:48	Cruz-Kasich deal is pretty simple. Cruz needs Indiana to stop Trump. New Mex/Ore have about same delegate total combined in xchng for Ind.

morningmoneyben	720438636303552512	2016-04-14T02:28:50	And Trump's idea of economic renaissance is sticking people back in dirty coal mines?
morningmoneyben	720438137814708226	2016-04-14T02:26:51	It was the same in Wisconsin, where Trump rattled off bullshit statistics in a state with very low unemployment.

morningmoneyben	709399705520832512	2016-03-14T15:24:04	Doing some delegate math (as one does) and it occurs to me that the June 7th California primary could actually matter quite a bit.

morningmoneyben	708367271538905090	2016-03-11T19:01:33	Being the most powerful economy and issuer of the global reserve currency has its advantages.  
morningmoneyben	708366972724121601	2016-03-11T19:00:21	So would I. But placing big tariffs on imported goods is not going to make this happen.  
morningmoneyben	708366604980129796	2016-03-11T18:58:54	And never mind that our collective trade deficit w/ China/Japan/Mexico (not that it matters) is around $500b. Our economy is $18 trillion

morningmoneyben	708363236748496897	2016-03-11T18:45:31	I would really like realDonaldTrump to explain to me how big tariffs on Chinese and Mexican goods would do anything but hurt the US economy

morningmoneyben	701621594565820416	2016-02-22T04:16:38	Lesson of Trump's ascendancy: the GOP electorate is far less conservative and far more tolerant of frank bigotry than I had understood.

morningmoneyben	701594425550618624	2016-02-22T02:28:40	Plenty of media outlets gorge on Trump ratings/clicks but covering him has nothing to do w/ partisanship.
morningmoneyben	701593950709293057	2016-02-22T02:26:47	I see this fever dream a lot, that Trump is a media creation intended to hurt Republicans. Sorry but it just aint so

morningmoneyben	701564583648108545	2016-02-22T00:30:05	Brian_F_Gardner yeah if he loses texas hes done
morningmoneyben	701564456451571716	2016-02-22T00:29:35	If Trump beats Cruz in Texas and Rubio in Florida, that's the ballgame.
morningmoneyben	701563849036734464	2016-02-22T00:27:10	lindsaygoldwert the whole episode is classic.
morningmoneyben	701563761233162240	2016-02-22T00:26:49	Sure but if he wins Texas and its 155 delegates...  
morningmoneyben	701563211812880385	2016-02-22T00:24:38	powellnyt I do think Rubio could beat him one-on-one but probably never gets the chance.
morningmoneyben	701562971076616193	2016-02-22T00:23:41	I guess the GOP hope has to be that Cruz is so humbled by Super Tuesday that he gets out. But he probably wins Texas that day so...
morningmoneyben	701562120031358977	2016-02-22T00:20:18	This is indeed the box the GOP is now in.

morningmoneyben	701532140593356800	2016-02-21T22:21:10	The media basically made the Trump campaign.  
morningmoneyben	701526354601320448	2016-02-21T21:58:11	The Trump campaign in one perfect sentence.  
morningmoneyben	701521737096282113	2016-02-21T21:39:50	Was on MSNBC, explaining that Trump doesn't need $ for ads because he gets so much free media, when they cut away from me to a Trump rally.
morningmoneyben	701522397103575040	2016-02-21T21:42:27	This is my constant mistake. I basically feel like I'm living in a nightmare from which there is no waking.  
morningmoneyben	701521744083992576	2016-02-21T21:39:52	I find it so weird when Trumpians criticize non-Trump candidates as RINOS when Trump is the literal definition of RINO.
