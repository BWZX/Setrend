samtanenhaus	700142738897960961	2016-02-18T02:20:11	don't get me wrong. cruz probably may have the best intellect of anyone in either party. but that, plus ivy degrees, equal what exactly?

samtanenhaus	700139783931064321	2016-02-18T02:08:27	am not advocating for trump, am just curious about what seems very high volume denial about his impact on voters, his range of support.
samtanenhaus	700139591643172865	2016-02-18T02:07:41	vpostrel that's my point:  what makes him more "serious" or legitimate than Trump?
samtanenhaus	700138989466980352	2016-02-18T02:05:17	vpostrel i don't hear serious opposition. i hear mockery, feigned shock, factitious outrage . . .
