johngreen	697545480721588224	2016-02-10T22:19:37	tori9240 Well, I don't think it should. Publishers add a lot of value--my editor made LFA much better over the years she helped me rewrite.

johngreen	697530477763301376	2016-02-10T21:20:00	jakem Right, but how do you, or even I, know if I'm commodifying your attention when we can't escape the possibility of brand influence?
johngreen	697529680690339840	2016-02-10T21:16:50	jetsjets For sure, but also a broader problem if it destabilizes our ability to trust anything said by anyone with an audience.
