relevantorgans	687850820516196352	2016-01-15T04:16:29	We’re reading Jeb Bush’s emails. It’s not that hard. We just sent him an email with an attachment labeled “donors that still support you”.

relevantorgans	687838160705945600	2016-01-15T03:26:11	The orange defendant makes an excellent point about the importance of informing on one’s neighbors at all times.
relevantorgans	687833838442156034	2016-01-15T03:09:01	Time for a new interpreter. The last one dissolved into 30 seconds of helpless giggles halfway through “President Jeb Bush.”
relevantorgans	687832726104313856	2016-01-15T03:04:35	Interpreter explaining that “New York values” means “jewish homosexual.”
relevantorgans	687831812421337089	2016-01-15T03:00:58	Interpreter in tears. We’re flying blind here. Humorous fat man apparently saying he has some kind of problem with dictatorship.
relevantorgans	687831613045108736	2016-01-15T03:00:10	Our translator must be confused. Now she says they want to arm all citizens with guns so that they can overthrow the president.
relevantorgans	687831603234508800	2016-01-15T03:00:08	So, does Chris Christie get sent to re-education immediately, or do they wait for a commercial break? How does it work?
relevantorgans	687830777132756992	2016-01-15T02:56:51	Why doesn’t ISIS get its guns from gun shows? I hear you can save a ton of money at them.
relevantorgans	687830276379119620	2016-01-15T02:54:51	Now here is a group of men who understand that power comes out of the barrel of a gun. MaoForPresident

relevantorgans	687829166960558080	2016-01-15T02:50:27	Wait, defendants get bathroom breaks? And what’s with the audience participation? Very poor courtroom discipline, FoxBusiness.
relevantorgans	687828279848337408	2016-01-15T02:46:55	Someone should tell Kasich you can achieve s better life than your parents by denouncing them and having them thrown in jail. WAY easier.
relevantorgans	687827603303100416	2016-01-15T02:44:14	When will Bush stop pretending he wasn’t “inspired” by all those “Xi!” campaign posters?

relevantorgans	687824518358810625	2016-01-15T02:31:58	So Donald Trump is the main defendant? We don’t understand. Are the other people on stage witnesses? How do American courtrooms work?
relevantorgans	687823867402817538	2016-01-15T02:29:23	We’ve just been informed that Americans don’t need a visa to go to Texas. Were not sure why that is, but whatever.
relevantorgans	687823131981910016	2016-01-15T02:26:28	Ted Cruz should look into holding up renewal of New York Times reporters' Texas J visas. It worked a treat for us.
relevantorgans	687822637129707520	2016-01-15T02:24:30	Fortunately for our interpreter, we’re already familiar with the phrase “I made a paperwork error” in all major languages.
