IsabelOakeshott	712271724914610176	2016-03-22T13:36:27	Hats off George_Osborne - whatever your view he just absolutely slammed it in the House
IsabelOakeshott	712270824967970816	2016-03-22T13:32:52	Overall very very robust performance by George_Osborne Not sure tone enhances his damaged leadership prospects but he emerges well in tact
IsabelOakeshott	712265711775838208	2016-03-22T13:12:33	So Osborne's tone fits exactly with my private information that he's not that fussed by events of recent days
IsabelOakeshott	712264919748636672	2016-03-22T13:09:24	Pure bloodsport between Cooper and Osborne here.. Front bench irrelevant.
IsabelOakeshott	712265067832672256	2016-03-22T13:10:00	Very very rowdy scenes as Osborne battles to defend his record
IsabelOakeshott	712264837489942528	2016-03-22T13:09:05	Not sure Chx is striking quite the right tone in the Chamber... sounding remarkably cocky
IsabelOakeshott	712262858902511617	2016-03-22T13:01:13	Oh here we go. Chx paying limited tribute to IDS. Through gritted teeth
IsabelOakeshott	712262260425621505	2016-03-22T12:58:50	Chx almost drowned out by cheers and jeers as he rises to speak but order v quickly restored when he opens with thoughts about Brussels
IsabelOakeshott	712260962787704832	2016-03-22T12:53:41	I am told by someone who knows Osborne well that implosion of his Budget is not keeping him awake at night.
IsabelOakeshott	712260384569335808	2016-03-22T12:51:23	Jeers and cries of "taxi for Osborne" as Chancellor appears in Commons chamber at v unfortunate moment during a discussion about Uber
IsabelOakeshott	712257798009184257	2016-03-22T12:41:06	In Commons chamber, an MP claims Ryanair is telling customers stranded in Brussels it will charge them £6k to get them home? Ryanair True?

IsabelOakeshott	711857009725931520	2016-03-21T10:08:31	This is essentially Osborne's perspective on the IDS saga. Interestingly it confirms Chx thinks IDS is a bit thick.

IsabelOakeshott	711490726366990336	2016-03-20T09:53:02	Remember Cameron made the Tories electable (just) on back of "Compassionate Conservatism." Has IDS just *re-toxified* the brand? Marr
IsabelOakeshott	711490326649819136	2016-03-20T09:51:27	This is massive moment for the Conservative Party with IDS accusing govt of implementing cuts that are disproportionately hurting poor Marr
IsabelOakeshott	711490109904965632	2016-03-20T09:50:35	Marr throws a very soft damp sponge at IDS on Osborne. "Can I put it to you you just don't like him?" How would afneil have put it? bbcsp

IsabelOakeshott	710978554280976384	2016-03-18T23:57:51	Bottom line: IDS sick to death of being messed around by Osborne, who he thinks cares more about his career than the disadvantaged. End of.
IsabelOakeshott	710977277874610176	2016-03-18T23:52:47	boulezian Perhaps so. He's a remarkable man who, post stepping down as party leader, did not care about his own political career.

IsabelOakeshott	710951144198184960	2016-03-18T22:08:56	Cameron should thank his lucky stars that IDS didn't do this before the last election. It might well have cost him a second administration.

IsabelOakeshott	710945507586260993	2016-03-18T21:46:32	The relationship between IDS and Osborne has been strained for years. IDS has seriously considered jacking it in on a number of occasions
IsabelOakeshott	710945028630302721	2016-03-18T21:44:38	IDS was one of Cameron's best - and most dangerous - Cabinet ministers because he was totally unbiddable. He didn't care about promotion.
IsabelOakeshott	710944244094083072	2016-03-18T21:41:31	Hang on a minute - Treasury was telling me earlier today that it was all IDS’s idea?!

IsabelOakeshott	708236127514312705	2016-03-11T10:20:25	nigelfletcher my logic is that an MP should be willing to shoulder the loss of 9p or indeed 45p in performing public service.

IsabelOakeshott	684488393284272128	2016-01-05T21:35:24	Bankersbonus1 I'm sure that's the case, at least sometimes. We are conscious of it too.
IsabelOakeshott	684485796397740033	2016-01-05T21:25:05	Bankersbonus1 absolutely. He has a huge sense of public duty.
IsabelOakeshott	684446104444878849	2016-01-05T18:47:22	Silver lining to MichaelDugher sacking is that he can devote more time to being half of a tough crime-fighting duo

IsabelOakeshott	684483503124295680	2016-01-05T21:15:58	Fascinating YouGov data. Why David_Cameron is asset for EURef (imo). Trust spreads more evenly across groups 
IsabelOakeshott	684483448048844800	2016-01-05T21:15:45	Bankersbonus1 I don't hate him in the slightest. Indeed I think he's an excellent PM.

IsabelOakeshott	684336852602585088	2016-01-05T11:33:14	Corbyn is daft to sack MichaelDugher.He's super smart, gets how govt works, vg communicator. I suspect he'll be quietly lethal on backbench
IsabelOakeshott	684332903833190400	2016-01-05T11:17:33	slogsweep He's not a cabinet minister who has broken the law. Simple as that.
IsabelOakeshott	684089372006854657	2016-01-04T19:09:50	On one level what's happening to Labour is amusing for us hacks. More importantly, it's a national tragedy leaving UK with no opposition (*)

IsabelOakeshott	683694846155055104	2016-01-03T17:02:08	Far too many column inches devoted to the irrelevant Simon Danczuk and his attention seeking ex wives. All so grubby. Enough already
