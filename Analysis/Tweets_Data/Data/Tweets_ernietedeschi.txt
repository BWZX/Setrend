ernietedeschi	724969131678793735	2016-04-26T14:31:24	ThomasHCrown I hear that. However, I think coding is a readily-usable skill that folks who choose not to go onto college can use.

ernietedeschi	697481139523620866	2016-02-10T18:03:56	swinshi RAVerBruggen Right. pi_1 will stay the same. Only pi_2 will change (and the POSTTREND intercept adjustment)
ernietedeschi	697480667081351168	2016-02-10T18:02:04	swinshi RAVerBruggen No, interestingly. Play around in Excel. If you end TREND at 8/14, then pi_1 is the same, but pi_2 becomes cum effect

ernietedeschi	697470094767738880	2016-02-10T17:20:03	swinshi RAVerBruggen Let's say post-8/14 slopis now +1 total. The regression math is such that TREND = -1 and POSTTREND = +2
ernietedeschi	697469493824655361	2016-02-10T17:17:40	RAVerBruggen swinshi Right. They've set it up so that you only have to look at pi_2 to see the "FE"
ernietedeschi	697468964641841152	2016-02-10T17:15:34	swinshi RAVerBruggen No, again that's the right way to interpret. POSTTREND is the *marginal effect* relative to TREND.
ernietedeschi	697468632117460992	2016-02-10T17:14:14	swinshi RAVerBruggen But POSTTREND picks up all the marginal fx. TREND isn't affected. If I have time I'll dig up other papers to send.
ernietedeschi	697468143174840320	2016-02-10T17:12:18	swinshi RAVerBruggen That's the right way to do a linear spline.

ernietedeschi	697467514289287168	2016-02-10T17:09:48	RAVerBruggen swinshi This seems like a legit linear spline. True that TREND continues but POSTTREND should pick up new trends.
ernietedeschi	697466807620345857	2016-02-10T17:06:59	swinshi How so? The regression discontinuity appears to be set up to be centered at August 2014.
