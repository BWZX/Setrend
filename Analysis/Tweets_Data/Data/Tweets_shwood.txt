shwood	725412023798910976	2016-04-27T19:51:18	YES!  This was the moment I realized last night's stream was gonna become epic.  Good find, sir!

shwood	725382899776806912	2016-04-27T17:55:34	esparzaisaiah glad you approve!
shwood	725382860895571968	2016-04-27T17:55:25	Every time I turn my phone sideways, I’m afraid everyone in the room knows there’s no possible way I’m doing something productive.
shwood	725381668404613120	2016-04-27T17:50:41	wete_pilliams that’s the problem, isn’t it? both sides can only theorize about the benefits/detriments, so it becomes a war of guesses.
shwood	725375986326507520	2016-04-27T17:28:06	wete_pilliams lol.  WHAT A TWIST!
shwood	725375920618483713	2016-04-27T17:27:50	wete_pilliams on balance, I think tremendous good came of the disclosures, and so far, nobody can point to a specific compelling detriment.
shwood	725375696785301504	2016-04-27T17:26:57	wete_pilliams I can totally see that challenge, but I think we’re having a “the perfect is the enemy of the good” discussion.
shwood	725375102897000448	2016-04-27T17:24:36	wete_pilliams fair enough.  Well, here’s hoping nobody gets murdered.
shwood	725374717557915648	2016-04-27T17:23:04	wete_pilliams (in the movie, of course)
shwood	725374668757151744	2016-04-27T17:22:52	wete_pilliams okay.  But I don’t follow how you’d cheer for his murder in a public forum.  You really would like to see him killed?
shwood	725373142290538496	2016-04-27T17:16:48	wete_pilliams (genuinely curious, not trying to stir up shit.  I just virtually never encounter your POV)
shwood	725373005812092933	2016-04-27T17:16:16	wete_pilliams huh.  Why would you hope for that? Do you think we’re somehow worse-off for knowing about illegal surveillance programs?
shwood	725369611072450560	2016-04-27T17:02:46	religion_stupid oh, yes
shwood	725369563722997760	2016-04-27T17:02:35	Mr_Gia I’m *guessing* that scene is meant to represent the moment he realized the full extent of the surveillance? (Maybe?)
shwood	725369319874531329	2016-04-27T17:01:37	Billyprops that’s an odd take.  Why do resent the American populace knowing about illegal government programs?
shwood	725368936745832448	2016-04-27T17:00:05	aaroneiche hopefully
shwood	725362561865138181	2016-04-27T16:34:45	16BitBeard agreed for sure

shwood	725360506886705152	2016-04-27T16:26:36	mikeyface it’s weird to look at this kinda thing, knowing you can watch the actual historical events in Citizen Four.
shwood	725360320609419264	2016-04-27T16:25:51	HailZiggurat good point.
shwood	725360257489358848	2016-04-27T16:25:36	PaulFreelend I’d assumed that was the case :-). Also, what’s your take on that counterpoint to the wired op-Ed about NGT?

shwood	723315525296766976	2016-04-22T01:00:34	ImAlexParton SkepticallyPwnd more like the unsuspecting victim in some kind of political attack.   (my apologies).
shwood	723312437647253505	2016-04-22T00:48:18	SkepticallyPwnd I'm not sure what I'd say to your email (especially since I'm the accused party here). but I'm at brian@shwood.com :-)
shwood	723312073715888128	2016-04-22T00:46:51	SkepticallyPwnd is there some better way than twitter you feel like we should connect?  If so, please let me know!
shwood	723311931583541250	2016-04-22T00:46:17	SkepticallyPwnd John, I'm not sure what to say, here.  Yes:  I have millions of fans. Yes, I want to interact with them.
shwood	723311605925163008	2016-04-22T00:44:59	SkepticallyPwnd ImAlexParton (but so far, you've done nothing but make crass assumptions and awful accusations...&amp; you're better than it)
shwood	723311338022416384	2016-04-22T00:43:56	SkepticallyPwnd ImAlexParton That's not at all what I'm doing.  If you'd ask, I'll be happy to explain my hunt for fans.
shwood	723311080882225156	2016-04-22T00:42:54	SkepticallyPwnd ImAlexParton what, making friends?  Are you jealous that I'm also making friends with Alex?  Is that what this is about?
shwood	723310887730315264	2016-04-22T00:42:08	SkepticallyPwnd so, go for it, John. What's so important that  you have to say that ImAlexParton can't get back to talking about rad stuff
shwood	723310651393847297	2016-04-22T00:41:12	SkepticallyPwnd See, ImAlexParton, and I were having a conversation, and it's YOU that injected yourself awkwardly in the middle.
shwood	723310453049405440	2016-04-22T00:40:25	SkepticallyPwnd ImAlexParton John, what's this really about?  Why are you so upset? What do you get out of injecting yourself in here?
shwood	723310156180783104	2016-04-22T00:39:14	SkepticallyPwnd ImAlexParton  that would be a tactless and inefficient way to reach friends, John. I suspect you could do better.
shwood	723309692475285504	2016-04-22T00:37:23	SkepticallyPwnd ImAlexParton THEY DON'T INVENT A HIGH OFFICE OF PROCLAIMING WHO'S FRIENDSHIPS ARE TRUE AND WHICH ARE DISALLOWED.
shwood	723309495426899968	2016-04-22T00:36:36	SkepticallyPwnd ImAlexParton ...I'll bet I'd make a lot of friends.  BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT NORMAL PEOPLE DO, JOHN.  THEY MAKE FRIENDS.
shwood	723300510980296704	2016-04-22T00:00:54	"Aha It's Not Legal What He Said" with Shwood &amp; CaptainMurphy 
shwood	723309000629035008	2016-04-22T00:34:38	SkepticallyPwnd ImAlexParton oh? what's the tactic, John?
shwood	723308759750180864	2016-04-22T00:33:41	ImAlexParton SkepticallyPwnd It seems like interacting with a bunch of people on twitter is exactly as immoral as shaking hands at a party
shwood	723294557580959746	2016-04-21T23:37:15	OGxZeus uh… I’m guessing you haven’t yet realized that I didn’t write the article…

shwood	723257423985815552	2016-04-21T21:09:42	SkepticallyPwnd well, I sort them into lists, for Sure. But muting/blocking?  It always feels too heavy for me.
shwood	723254653568176129	2016-04-21T20:58:41	SkepticallyPwnd not sure what you mean.. that have muted me?  or that I've muted?  (I pretty much never mute people)

shwood	722593704502960129	2016-04-20T01:12:18	bluewaterjuice Personally, I'd just love it if you stopped stomping on my junk all the time and acting like the twitter police.  Deal?
shwood	722593490551504896	2016-04-20T01:11:27	bluewaterjuice or how you knew I was talking about a like button when the tweet mentioning it was deleted.  *cough*
shwood	722593365087223808	2016-04-20T01:10:58	bluewaterjuice Look, it's none of my business why you delete all your tweets, or why you're diving into my archive.
shwood	722593151077122048	2016-04-20T01:10:07	bluewaterjuice oh, hello!  What's this? 
shwood	722592171619012608	2016-04-20T01:06:13	bluewaterjuice 
shwood	722591952378601472	2016-04-20T01:05:21	bluewaterjuice seems like there's another account I know that likes to delete their tweets... and show off drawings.  And is a CN fan...
shwood	722591808761401344	2016-04-20T01:04:46	bluewaterjuice Now how would you know this was a sarcastic response acting like I've never heard of a "like" button?
shwood	722591599855665152	2016-04-20T01:03:57	bluewaterjuice uh oh, did we just discover a fact about you? Because this tweet is a reply to something...that was deleted.
shwood	722556322000949248	2016-04-19T22:43:46	agraceoflove usually if I don't hear from someone, I assume they just aren't a fan and I slink away... apologies &amp; fixed now!

shwood	721773031681437696	2016-04-17T18:51:15	ullh82w8 So, hugs and kisses and I hope you enjoy the rest of the series. XOXOXO

shwood	721771360712720384	2016-04-17T18:44:36	ullh82w8 And in that clip (which it sounds like you still haven't watched), a hammer fails to break a window repeatedly.
shwood	721771143267360769	2016-04-17T18:43:45	ullh82w8 yes. we were talking about my show. And then I shared with you the clip that inspired that scene. And then you started yelling.
shwood	721767651974844416	2016-04-17T18:29:52	ullh82w8 you didn't watch the video.  That's a hammer.  Also, please don't be upset. This is a really weird thing for you to be upset over.
shwood	721766374700228608	2016-04-17T18:24:48	ullh82w8 You're right.  What *idiot* would assume that a regular hammer couldn't smash a window?  
shwood	721761759913058304	2016-04-17T18:06:27	ullh82w8 whoa, Jim!  What's with this hostility?

shwood	720492677352046593	2016-04-14T06:03:35	Can't get over the fact this opening sequence isn't rotoscoped.  So that's what animation talent looks like, eh?

shwood	720301128332746752	2016-04-13T17:22:26	rabidbadger JustinRYoung seems legit.
shwood	720300394937774080	2016-04-13T17:19:31	Riglo honestly: they’ve so over teased thanos that I don’t even care anymore. To me, he’s the guy getting ready to prepare to almost start.
shwood	720296026582724608	2016-04-13T17:02:09	Riglo much more relevant would be to ask “what did the highest grossing action movie get for the last 4 summers?”
shwood	720295851567026176	2016-04-13T17:01:28	Riglo I don’t know that a 10-year setup really matters.  You could say the next James Bond movie has a 40 year setup.

shwood	720007894402355200	2016-04-12T21:57:13	PatrickRothfuss scottlynch78 absolutely!  And the audiobook was performed wonderfully, too.

shwood	720004959299706880	2016-04-12T21:45:33	Sure.  After the murder, thievery, betrayal, alchemy, scams, con games, and sleight of hand...

shwood	716991132589162502	2016-04-04T14:09:41	lextm94 hulu there was a “captain tripps” graffiti in sideways future, too
shwood	716990972475736064	2016-04-04T14:09:03	Radium I left the tweet up so people wouldn’t wonder what I was immediately raging at after.  Revoked the app tho
shwood	716990829735194624	2016-04-04T14:08:29	armchairnomad I used hoot suite as a post-to-everywhere solution, but since they never could post to g+, I just got out of using them.
shwood	716990343028211714	2016-04-04T14:06:33	gwud main feed is totally crazy.  There’s a few lists that I watch closely though
shwood	716866275587137536	2016-04-04T05:53:33	CCJ_Random it’s kinda a cool platform for live streaming.  No idea if it’ll take off, but it’s definitely different.
shwood	716852946734960641	2016-04-04T05:00:35	MarkSheppard it gets pretty clear as the camera approaches, but that's the only frame where you can read it all at once.
shwood	716852392315068416	2016-04-04T04:58:23	MarkSheppard see the "Redrum"?
shwood	716852054380052481	2016-04-04T04:57:02	MarkSheppard you've seen the shining, right?
shwood	716851316878802945	2016-04-04T04:54:07	Cute, hulu.  #112263 
shwood	716849156958982146	2016-04-04T04:45:32	MinardiCeiling it's based on who you're following.  In your case, took an educated gamble you'd know my stuff... I'm guessing it paid off?
shwood	716848299664224256	2016-04-04T04:42:07	Simawesome not that I'm above such skullduggery... but dammit, I'D LIKE TO KNOW!!!
shwood	716847779209805824	2016-04-04T04:40:03	I have to think it was a mistake on their end... if not, that was a shockingly good way to get me to shit all over their service.
shwood	716847472102912006	2016-04-04T04:38:50	Huh... so weird. Was some app I never used that I signed up for 3 years ago. Aaaand....REVOKED! (you too, hootsuite)

shwood	716778575597162496	2016-04-04T00:05:04	TomCannan I did.  Looks like my "stable" overclock was no longer so stable.  Dropped speeds and it ran for 4 hours straight.

shwood	716655401027043329	2016-04-03T15:55:37	ps_fanatic BOO!  I can't handle having everything dumbed-down. Once you've tasted PC gaming, you become elitist :-D
shwood	716655228926308353	2016-04-03T15:54:56	justinra yeah.  It turns out my overclock settings wasn't as stable as should be.
shwood	716493735291277312	2016-04-03T05:13:12	t2t2 not on this one, I don't think. In any case, I removed all OC's and it seems super stable now.

shwood	716423789559480322	2016-04-03T00:35:16	well, that clears some of this up:  ran a prime95 stress test and everything immediately locked up. dropped all OC's and running again.
shwood	716414925409636352	2016-04-03T00:00:03	viewfromathrone yeah.  went up to like 5 months back.

shwood	716372479564906496	2016-04-02T21:11:23	ELahti but then the fans just keep running.  Have to hold down the power for a hard shutdown each time.
shwood	716372383091654657	2016-04-02T21:11:00	ELahti I blew a whole day trying to figure out what was up with the shutdown issue. Flashed the BIOS and everything. Win10 closes, but+
shwood	716372110608769024	2016-04-02T21:09:55	ELahti yeah, there's a few other weirdnesses I'm getting on this box. Chrome freezes randomly, and it'll restart but not shut down.

shwood	716370165395365889	2016-04-02T21:02:11	ELahti it plays for anywhere from 3 to 15 minutes before just spitting me out to windows. The 970 never even gets warm enough to use fans.
shwood	716370001322639360	2016-04-02T21:01:32	ELahti yeah.  GTX 970 on a liquid-cooled beast.  I'm just out of ideas now :-/

shwood	715572972971433985	2016-03-31T16:14:26	@scitteraire yeah, but that line of justification just feels like veiled tribalism (support our local guys! screw  the other!) to me.
shwood	715572533127307264	2016-03-31T16:12:41	bloom_brenda it all goes in the recycling, sure.
shwood	715572252784209921	2016-03-31T16:11:34	It seems like the efficiency of their systems would save fuel, etc. and be better overall.  Also, cardboard has a 91% recycle rate...
shwood	715571975914041344	2016-03-31T16:10:28	What's the environmental impact of all the extra packaging involved when I buy stuff on amazon? Is it any more environmental to buy locally?
shwood	715567704896180224	2016-03-31T15:53:30	Hey all!  We're shooting Scam School from 5p-8pmish TONIGHT at the Corner Bar... who's coming?   
shwood	715553290402930688	2016-03-31T14:56:13	@Igettheoutronet good enough for me!

shwood	715549637910798337	2016-03-31T14:41:42	hack58 JustinRYoung jeffcannata there's definitely a gambling element... The calculated risk of sitting on our cash felt like poker.
shwood	715545860273098752	2016-03-31T14:26:41	JustinRYoung hack58 jeffcannata Really loved the random. Plus: oh dear God the bureaucratic *nightmare* that ordering-by-popularity'd be
shwood	715539380086005761	2016-03-31T14:00:56	LeeBratina very nice!!
shwood	715538900240863232	2016-03-31T13:59:02	haha... Dude, gatowag and team killed it on saving this episode!   
shwood	715538655528353792	2016-03-31T13:58:04	josh4prez2032 nah.  The robots will be creating the other robots.
shwood	715535234209615873	2016-03-31T13:44:28	Cbhanupratap1 why's that?  you'd still want to be healthy, right?  And you wouldn't have a job keeping you from the gym...
shwood	715535105771503618	2016-03-31T13:43:57	Tim_Stevens oh, jeeze.  I didn't even think about that side of things.  I can see that being a nightmare.
shwood	715534871456665600	2016-03-31T13:43:02	tehmarken yeah.  That's exactly what I think, too.  You can life a fine life for free, but you'll work to get the "nicer" things.
shwood	715534175143473152	2016-03-31T13:40:15	PaulFreelend JustinRYoung hhahaa!

shwood	715533912663961600	2016-03-31T13:39:13	mr_dexter_scott I disagree. The new capitalism will be to do the only thing the robots can't:  invent new things we want the robots to do.

shwood	715531479292358657	2016-03-31T13:29:33	gregjuhn That's not what we saw in Second Life. Essentially, all resources were free and unlimited, but people paid for other's efforts.

shwood	707749359014707200	2016-03-10T02:06:11	jeremyminer yeah, specifically: your reward is to do it again, but with increased difficulty.
shwood	707663524407840768	2016-03-09T20:25:06	Never put off until tomorrow that which can be done the day after tomorrow.
shwood	707658837851918336	2016-03-09T20:06:29	mikealtmyer yeah… But in dong so it just makes the editor look like the real grammar nazi
shwood	707623398889754624	2016-03-09T17:45:39	FWGMills exactly!!
shwood	707622639292944385	2016-03-09T17:42:38	R3dn4 acedtect uhh… neshcom?
shwood	707600327738961920	2016-03-09T16:13:59	JustinRYoung you are not prepared for this breakfast scramble. 
shwood	707598564852011008	2016-03-09T16:06:59	TonyJr96 I’ve only (ever!) seen it in a quote
shwood	707598399424503808	2016-03-09T16:06:19	HighTechBill that sounds like a really good way to handle that problem…  …in 1943.
shwood	707598119102361602	2016-03-09T16:05:12	meetrobertsmith well, then, I suspect the Internet would point that out quickly, wouldn’t they?
shwood	707597884422619137	2016-03-09T16:04:16	sjhawken in the age of ctrl-c, Ctrl-v… Yes
shwood	707597221265432578	2016-03-09T16:01:38	FWGMills YES!
shwood	707597139996585984	2016-03-09T16:01:19	at_underscore EXACTLY!
shwood	707590329315135488	2016-03-09T15:34:15	meetrobertsmith who types stuff?  the reporter ctrl-c'd it
shwood	707590143314538496	2016-03-09T15:33:31	noliberalbull yeah, but in those cases, we put them [in brackets] and don't even use [sic]
shwood	707589913345003520	2016-03-09T15:32:36	sjhawken isn't that what the quotation marks are supposed to do?
shwood	707584041889869824	2016-03-09T15:09:16	jayyoung I understand why it's there.  I don't understand why we use it in an age when you can hyperlink to the source to accomplish that.
shwood	707583787496964096	2016-03-09T15:08:15	jmarsteller right.  so it's effective at the 8% who care, while negatively coloring the article for the 92% who don't. :-/
shwood	707583410072457216	2016-03-09T15:06:45	sggrissom why not just hyperlink to the original quote?
shwood	707583303956627456	2016-03-09T15:06:20	Atkins_Dave couldn't you just hyperlink to the original quote? and if people are wondering who made the mistake, they can click?
shwood	707583156270960640	2016-03-09T15:05:45	PJR23 it does satisfy that vast minority of people wondering who made the mistake. It also annoys 100% of the readers with its smugness.
shwood	707582947176488962	2016-03-09T15:04:55	johnebosworth nice!
shwood	707582898686140416	2016-03-09T15:04:43	brycas yeah, but most the time, [sic] is just a neon sign screaming "I caught a grammatical mistake here... can YOU spot it too?"
shwood	707582572679684096	2016-03-09T15:03:26	mikezook me too!  which looks pretty smug to me... not you?
shwood	707582476437196804	2016-03-09T15:03:03	WirelessServInc I can get that in a world before ctrl-C
shwood	707582324485918720	2016-03-09T15:02:27	brycas I totally get the function, but I think it colors the article in a negative way every time I see it used.
shwood	707582099381837824	2016-03-09T15:01:33	brycas right, but that's (let's say) 10% of your audience.  The fix is to have 100% of your readers think you're a smug elitist?
shwood	707581846654070784	2016-03-09T15:00:33	Why aren't the quotation marks enough for that? It's not like everyone thinks you're racist when you quote Hitler. 
shwood	707581597680164864	2016-03-09T14:59:33	DPage1992 oh, man... I'd LOVE to.
shwood	707581532743946240	2016-03-09T14:59:18	jmarsteller yeah, but while this does silence the few people who'd complain about that, 100% of everyone else thinks you sound smug.
shwood	707581278636236800	2016-03-09T14:58:17	SriCharan79 elaborate, plz?
shwood	707581039472840704	2016-03-09T14:57:20	bennyfactor but if it's inside the quotation marks, why do we need that?  it's clearly the quoted's words, not the author's.
shwood	707580842286063618	2016-03-09T14:56:33	adding [sic] to any quote just looks like the author crowing about how much smarter they are than the person they're quoting.
shwood	707580585623945216	2016-03-09T14:55:32	I don't understand the use of [sic] in journalism. I mean, if the text is in quotes, then clearly it's their wrong words, not yours...right?

shwood	707576962408062976	2016-03-09T14:41:08	chemcaper Personally, I always dug chemistry.  Always felt like "the real work" in science to me.

shwood	706853333676339200	2016-03-07T14:45:42	justinra no, I shat the bed and lost 4 in a row.  still at 499 this am.

shwood	706853091841191936	2016-03-07T14:44:44	PaulFreelend hahahaha
shwood	706852991697965056	2016-03-07T14:44:20	p1p Dude.  He wasn't even looking at it.  He glanced at the end and announced both a systolic and diastolic pressre.
shwood	706852808721506305	2016-03-07T14:43:36	ilovejennyg_13 yeah, it's good.
shwood	706852724839571456	2016-03-07T14:43:16	TheWhiskeyWolf oh, jeeze.  I shat the bed on this.  Got handed 4 shitstorms in a row and went to bed still at 499.  Trying again.
shwood	706852585697710080	2016-03-07T14:42:43	NyotaimoriNurse yeah, but he gave both systolic and diastolic... and wasn't looking.
shwood	706852455242305536	2016-03-07T14:42:12	JJJadedJane exactly!  Yay! someone gets it!
shwood	706852347876483072	2016-03-07T14:41:47	nezumi_h I'll accept this answer as 100% valid.
shwood	706852227437166592	2016-03-07T14:41:18	jdtolbert right.  But he gave both, using a manual pump, with no stethoscope, and without looking at it.
shwood	706734299010068481	2016-03-07T06:52:42	jamiehuckerby aw, man.

shwood	706724838719684609	2016-03-07T06:15:06	RocIngersoll yatengonick good point.
shwood	706724155563995137	2016-03-07T06:12:23	gMagicScott nuclearcarly that makes sense.  You can definitely feel that moment.  Thanks for the tip.
shwood	706723443509579777	2016-03-07T06:09:33	jeffalopolis only one way to verify that for sure... :-)
shwood	706723164089294848	2016-03-07T06:08:27	gMagicScott how's that work?
shwood	706722889773375488	2016-03-07T06:07:21	swordedge agreed.
shwood	706722843417939968	2016-03-07T06:07:10	KelAskaniSon AHA!  Underwood didn't check a watch.  So either I'm right, or Underwood is more awesome than we thought.
shwood	706722339568820225	2016-03-07T06:05:10	Sonikku_a AzureAngel17 literal LOL
shwood	706722192570974208	2016-03-07T06:04:35	DanaBrunetti DANA HELP MEEEE!  I made a joke comment about UF's BP cuff and the internet is slaughtering me! (also, having a blast w/S4)
shwood	706721706820251648	2016-03-07T06:02:39	freakin_frankie Those sound like two mutually exclusive requests... :-)
shwood	706721621361315840	2016-03-07T06:02:19	yatengonick fascinating... what's the systolic/diastolic threshhold?
shwood	706721453811458050	2016-03-07T06:01:39	perfface4radio as many as I can watch once the internet gets off my high-blood-pressure testicles. (which should be... 7?)
shwood	706721258256224256	2016-03-07T06:00:52	Well, shoot.  This adds a wrinkle.  Can anyone verify Underwood was using palpation? palpgazi cuffTRUTH 
shwood	706720860032249856	2016-03-07T05:59:17	Diegoandangie Man, that sucks.  Also: this isn't an automatic pump.  But mainly: that sucks and I love you.
shwood	706720647523598336	2016-03-07T05:58:27	To be 100% clear: I am loving the hell out of this new season, and was just having a chuckle at an incomplete prop. No need to panic.
shwood	706720417285693440	2016-03-07T05:57:32	Yes, I get that there are automatic ones. But president Underwood is not wearing one. He's wearing a manual one. 
shwood	706720197961347072	2016-03-07T05:56:40	Dang. Suddenly this is a medical lesson. Guys: you can't get your pressure from a manual cuff w/o a stethoscope 
shwood	706719419049779202	2016-03-07T05:53:34	scottgfx an old fashioned manual cuff. Which requires a stethoscope to work.  Which was my point.
shwood	706719230532591620	2016-03-07T05:52:49	sheepdog5931 lane_lorenz Zoyx (again:  this is a pedantic, small thing I noticed.  So not worth the arguments brewing over it)
shwood	706719072881258496	2016-03-07T05:52:11	sheepdog5931 lane_lorenz Zoyx let me know when you see the scene.  Would love to know if he appears to have done that.
shwood	706718947597357056	2016-03-07T05:51:41	stina_hyena thank god! You're the only one who seems to have noticed!
shwood	706718837480140801	2016-03-07T05:51:15	Diegoandangie Zoyx yeah...this prop is not that one.
shwood	706718689232465920	2016-03-07T05:50:40	yatengonick explain, please.
shwood	706718391545933824	2016-03-07T05:49:29	Diegoandangie Zoyx pumping it doesn't do anything.  blood pressure is defined as the pressures that you stop/start hearing heartbeats.
shwood	706718066915184640	2016-03-07T05:48:11	yatengonick (sorry for being so pedantic.  It's a tiny thing that drove me nuts)
shwood	706717973357023232	2016-03-07T05:47:49	yatengonick right.  which is used for manually taking blood pressure.  Which he's not doing, since he doesn't have a stethoscope
shwood	706716873744740352	2016-03-07T05:43:27	yatengonick is that what this is? (I know there's a thing that does a thing...but he's not wearing it) 
shwood	706715599502647296	2016-03-07T05:38:23	chirag Zoyx oh!  is that what he's wearing?  because it *definitely looks like a manual cuff*
shwood	706715428718977024	2016-03-07T05:37:43	datawar oh, shoot!  is he wearing that?  because he DEFINITELY LOOKS LIKE HE'S JUST WEARING A RANDOM MANUAL CUFF.
shwood	706715271919063040	2016-03-07T05:37:05	lane_lorenz Zoyx yes.  Which doesn't do anything if nobody is listening for the systolic and diastolic pressure.
shwood	706714860910817280	2016-03-07T05:35:27	yatengonick uh... doesn't someone need to hear it?  considering it's just a cuff he's wearing?
shwood	706714613228793856	2016-03-07T05:34:28	right...Which he's not wearing. 
shwood	706714460203790336	2016-03-07T05:33:52	TimLydon0 with a stethoscope.  I think systolic is the pressure at which you can hear the beat start, and diastolic is when you can't hear.
shwood	706713956576993280	2016-03-07T05:31:52	yatengonick I thought systolic was when you could start hearing HB, and diastolic was when you stopped.
shwood	706713256874766337	2016-03-07T05:29:05	uh, Mr. President... that's not how blood pressure works. You need like a...stethoscope I think? 
shwood	706706339863490565	2016-03-07T05:01:36	AMAZING!  Make us a video tutorial!

shwood	705975563513495553	2016-03-05T04:37:45	“It was in my pocket the whole time.”  Most embarrassing and deeply relieving ending to every lost-item horror story.
shwood	705971771481001984	2016-03-05T04:22:41	russellmbrown yes.
shwood	705971527569682433	2016-03-05T04:21:43	SheliaLieberman I *think* that one expired in 2013?

shwood	705921653662846976	2016-03-05T01:03:32	JayBronks I honestly don’t know.  Looked through your feed and most of your posts were you bragging about being blocked. I don’t get it.
shwood	705921194327846912	2016-03-05T01:01:42	JayBronks or what, you’ll beg me to block you?
shwood	705920994007846913	2016-03-05T01:00:55	No promises.  
shwood	705920596987682816	2016-03-05T00:59:20	@TWebBond only one way to—AHHHH!!!  It worked!!!!
shwood	705920426694737920	2016-03-05T00:58:39	A bit of advice? Stop using the word “cringy.” It’s the 2010′s version of “douche,” which was the 2000′s version of “don’t have a cow, man.”
shwood	705919948934123520	2016-03-05T00:56:45	JoshuaCaleb75 fair enough
shwood	705917837664124929	2016-03-05T00:48:22	VATStudios ORLY??
shwood	705917674027520001	2016-03-05T00:47:43	kevinmenzel we talking about the same trailer? Because I did see a sloppy one elsewhere…

shwood	705916951411830784	2016-03-05T00:44:51	Twice, even!  Man, that was so much fun. 
shwood	705914381846982656	2016-03-05T00:34:38	Mandogyrocks oh, Jeeze
shwood	705914141249130497	2016-03-05T00:33:41	Question: is this a better fan-cut trailer because of its pacing? Or because it makes use of the song we all loved? 
shwood	705913370101178368	2016-03-05T00:30:37	jpwarg Cordkillers I’ll give it a try

shwood	705769633119244288	2016-03-04T14:59:27	PrioHuq I think you missed the entire "if you want to say 'thank you'" part.
shwood	705768438052982784	2016-03-04T14:54:42	If you want to say "thank you," don't say "I'm sorry"

shwood	705511086926094336	2016-03-03T21:52:05	LaraEakins well, the actual atmospheres should be the same as in the small bottle, right?  just more air to move to get there?
shwood	705508277103144960	2016-03-03T21:40:55	LaraEakins oh, man. I bet that'd look awesome.
shwood	705507645088669696	2016-03-03T21:38:24	LaraEakins whoa!  Nice.
shwood	705499321744031746	2016-03-03T21:05:20	If you caught our "whiskey vapor" preview episode of the Modern Rogue last month, it's up on the main feed now: 
shwood	705498586495078400	2016-03-03T21:02:25	Jackjbird crazy.  That's some serious sci-fi stuff there.
shwood	705486888480538624	2016-03-03T20:15:56	pickover I noticed it's also a smile, and thought it suggests their shipping logistics.
shwood	705472847892733952	2016-03-03T19:20:08	copacetyk heck yes, but just know it was the brilliant gatowag’s idea :-)

shwood	705472348548255744	2016-03-03T19:18:09	basiccomic I had a brief flash of horror, thinking you were commenting on my last tweet.
shwood	705450420982849536	2016-03-03T17:51:01	DevJoshLopez thanks so much, man.  Means the world to hear.
shwood	705450264031932416	2016-03-03T17:50:24	Of all the reasons to not like someone, the dumbest is because they “try too hard.” We’re ALL supposed to try hard.
shwood	705417906771746816	2016-03-03T15:41:49	Which makes it a bit weird that they seem to be setting it in the same world, right? 
shwood	705415891601616898	2016-03-03T15:33:49	antivanti yeah, especially since it seems to be set in the same world?
shwood	705415724123058176	2016-03-03T15:33:09	SirWedgie hah!

shwood	704755201429762048	2016-03-01T19:48:28	BigDaddy978 I understand the sentiment, but that’s a bit too cynical and horrific for my tastes.

shwood	704749453542961152	2016-03-01T19:25:37	Twitchikins on the contrary:  100% of the candidates who won have been voted for.  Voting for the lesser of evils is still voting for evil.

shwood	704501498202312704	2016-03-01T03:00:20	slinganswers nope.  they're all spinning circles.
shwood	704501096618729472	2016-03-01T02:58:45	slinganswers appreciate the effort, but even on "low" quality the PC app does jack shit.  Any other suggestions?

shwood	704500872470855680	2016-03-01T02:57:51	Juryfacts Sling Dunno if it's the PC app or what.  Trying to change connection settings now.

shwood	704500337139290112	2016-03-01T02:55:44	Anyone have a suggestion for how to watch this week’s episode of Better Call Saul w/o cable? No luck with sling, unfortunately.
shwood	704499934855172097	2016-03-01T02:54:08	Hey sling! Sorry to report that I’m on track to miss Better Call Saul for the third week in a row &gt;:-/ 
shwood	704498485060481024	2016-03-01T02:48:22	CSDemocratCS you're a hero.  **high fives!**
shwood	704498434196148224	2016-03-01T02:48:10	sethwebster RIGHT??
shwood	704496590677934081	2016-03-01T02:40:50	CSDemocratCS no worries.  I figured you figured that.  Now that we're friends again, can I follow you again? :-)
shwood	704496379352080384	2016-03-01T02:40:00	CSDemocratCS the followback game is a dumb waste of bandwidth.  Everyone shouting, nobody listening.  I'm looking for genuine latent fans.
shwood	704496150632484868	2016-03-01T02:39:05	CSDemocratCS where's the shadiness or duplicity?  this is the social media equivalent of shaking hands and introducing yourself at a party.
shwood	704495948940967936	2016-03-01T02:38:17	CSDemocratCS OMG.  I wish I could afford to be that asshole who outsources everything.  Not there by a longshot.  It's really me.
shwood	704495763712114688	2016-03-01T02:37:33	CSDemocratCS ...where's the scam part in all of that?
shwood	704495705935581184	2016-03-01T02:37:19	CSDemocratCS (3) If the ARE a fan, they react/chat via at-replies, we connect, and become happy twitter friends forever.
shwood	704495546380079104	2016-03-01T02:36:41	CSDemocratCS (2) If they don't know me, after a week of no interaction, I assume they're not a fan and slink away awkwardly.
shwood	704495422971076608	2016-03-01T02:36:12	CSDemocratCS (1): someone follows all my fellow hosts on natgeo or discovery, but not me. So I guess they might know me and I follow them.
shwood	704495212572225536	2016-03-01T02:35:22	CSDemocratCS it's totally not what I'm talking about. Here's what I'm up to, and you can tell me if it's a scam:
shwood	704494911928688640	2016-03-01T02:34:10	RichWildman no namecalling, here.  Ain't nothing wrong with kicking it old-fashioned.
shwood	704494706940469248	2016-03-01T02:33:21	CSDemocratCS if you have a better suggestion to reach out to latent fans, I'm all ears to hear it.
shwood	704494568817831937	2016-03-01T02:32:48	CSDemocratCS if you responded, we'd be talking, you'd be whitelisted &amp; we'd be best friends. But you didn't, so we didn't, and we're not :/
shwood	704494350080675840	2016-03-01T02:31:56	CSDemocratCS ain't no trick. I followed because I thought you were a fan, unfollowed because you didn't respond. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
shwood	704494072149323776	2016-03-01T02:30:50	RichWildman well, by that logic, it would also outlaw kindle books, since they require power cords.
shwood	704493940272050176	2016-03-01T02:30:18	szeq924 burner depends on the phone, and where/how you buy minutes.
shwood	704492166572150784	2016-03-01T02:23:15	burner oh, heck yes.  What's the best way to reach you guys?
shwood	704491949575680000	2016-03-01T02:22:24	Hygard_Jels likely so!  hit me up when you're coming :-)
shwood	704472901727064064	2016-03-01T01:06:42	levi_mccormick haha
shwood	704458235860783104	2016-03-01T00:08:26	OHHHH SHIT SON!  The world's #1 show about cutting the cord is LIVE RIGHT NOW! 
shwood	704450844742148097	2016-02-29T23:39:04	dude, you guys have been a lifesaver. 
shwood	704432845561810944	2016-02-29T22:27:32	FurnitureFlippn accurate
shwood	704432640506482688	2016-02-29T22:26:43	FurnitureFlippn oh, I've heard plenty of those bragged about as well (FWIW)
shwood	704432492372107265	2016-02-29T22:26:08	theMadgician stick it to the Man, man.
shwood	704428151204503552	2016-02-29T22:08:53	jfdubeau I like that.
shwood	704426603292413952	2016-02-29T22:02:44	StacyBee23 no idea.  but it got me thinking on the curious notion of how we treat scars.
shwood	704423064243539969	2016-02-29T21:48:40	Micah_McFarland you *know* I loves me some Harmontown.
shwood	704419064433610752	2016-02-29T21:32:47	JustABreeze19 :-)
shwood	704419009496612864	2016-02-29T21:32:33	Scars are weird.  You don’t want them, you resent watching them form, and then you spend a lifetime bragging about them.
shwood	704416312643039232	2016-02-29T21:21:51	jcdeau WELL DONE!
shwood	704414907945496576	2016-02-29T21:16:16	Saraswatih lol.  They’re stuck in my head, too.

shwood	704411491194134528	2016-02-29T21:02:41	JiishaaN heh.  have you watched it yet?
shwood	704411224394461185	2016-02-29T21:01:37	I mean, it's really good to see the history channel finally focus on the *history*, right?
shwood	704410831048454144	2016-02-29T21:00:04	Pretty sure this is the best show I've ever encountered.  Not sure I can get enough: 
shwood	704403547668873216	2016-02-29T20:31:07	CliftonB RIGHT??

shwood	704399730160173058	2016-02-29T20:15:57	Just 10 cuts into wood.  Never saw it coming:  
shwood	704372112186695680	2016-02-29T18:26:12	ryanpdg1 a pic of your boob, naturally.
shwood	704365747720421376	2016-02-29T18:00:55	K6PER I have literally no idea what you’re talking about.  When did I call you stupid?
shwood	704347113027559424	2016-02-29T16:46:52	mistie710 I see what you did there :-)
shwood	704346311336693760	2016-02-29T16:43:41	ThePossumPosse oh, hey!  congrats on crossing 10M!
shwood	704343189352624128	2016-02-29T16:31:17	Woo! Flight of the Conchords US tour!  Tickets go on sale this friday:  
shwood	704343037812482049	2016-02-29T16:30:40	pickover was it the "perimeter" part that they missed?
shwood	704342905440174080	2016-02-29T16:30:09	@ShooterChick79 tweetmix AQAkristineg I'm not sure what you're asking.  Do I disagree with what?
shwood	704341163092762624	2016-02-29T16:23:13	@ShooterChick79 tweetmix AQAkristineg as my evidence I submit 200+ years of American politics.
shwood	704341057522171904	2016-02-29T16:22:48	@ShooterChick79 tweetmix AQAkristineg I disagree that mocking is in any way an effective strategy.  It will feel good, yield nothing.
shwood	704338428490489857	2016-02-29T16:12:21	ericgeller whoa.
shwood	704337225996046336	2016-02-29T16:07:35	new Scam School Remix out, in which I do a pretty good impression of dressing like a grandpa:  
shwood	704326547570716672	2016-02-29T15:25:09	MorRobots oh, I don't actually think it'll change a single mind, but it was amazing to watch.
shwood	704326252610482177	2016-02-29T15:23:59	aw, man!  I liked Mad Dogs.  
shwood	704325032130969600	2016-02-29T15:19:08	@xtDiee took a gamble that you might be a fan, based on who you're following.  Was I right?
shwood	704324737904701441	2016-02-29T15:17:57	tweetmix AQAkristineg oh, man.  I don't know that I can disagree more with this sentence.
shwood	704324580949643264	2016-02-29T15:17:20	VergaraLautaro I think that's an unfair categorization and a poor argument. There's clearly something more than that to his following.
shwood	704320946576830464	2016-02-29T15:02:53	brandonlpierce heh.  pretty convenient move, no?
shwood	704315665503490048	2016-02-29T14:41:54	TheOwenEffect well done!

shwood	703727378078396417	2016-02-27T23:44:16	If shwood and I die from what we're filming tomorrow, remember that we loved you.
shwood	703724722769367040	2016-02-27T23:33:43	Caleb_Brereton yeah, that makes sense.
shwood	703724583686270977	2016-02-27T23:33:09	Wild gorillas compose happy songs that they hum during meals:  
shwood	703721900191539200	2016-02-27T23:22:30	fuinneoger dangit!
shwood	703720958054395904	2016-02-27T23:18:45	fuinneoger thanks, man.  That's kinda how I feel.
shwood	703720376073728000	2016-02-27T23:16:26	Caleb_Brereton like, folks who maybe have seen one video in the last 3 months, and didn't even know we did giveaways.
shwood	703720276694061061	2016-02-27T23:16:03	Caleb_Brereton yeah, I was wondering if we attracted a bunch of "cubers," but it appears to be very-casual SS viewers miffed.
shwood	703719707291963392	2016-02-27T23:13:47	Caleb_Brereton I think *that's* the issue. For whatever reason, people are just expecting something other than delivered.
shwood	703719274204925952	2016-02-27T23:12:04	Caleb_Brereton (margins for the creator, that is)
shwood	703719228998684673	2016-02-27T23:11:53	Caleb_Brereton magic effects tend to have generous margins, on account of what you're really buying is years of polishing the routines.
shwood	703719081296293888	2016-02-27T23:11:18	Caleb_Brereton (a) not my price.  (b) comes with 5 cubes, multiple gimmicks, and a full suite of video instructions. It's a real value IMO
shwood	703718821056503808	2016-02-27T23:10:16	Caleb_Brereton fair enough, though I still really can't see it's much different from these:  
shwood	703717784195182593	2016-02-27T23:06:08	adamaarts PhantomBug interesting. in this case, explaining how the gimmick works would be crass exposure of magic, unfortunately.
shwood	703714948321443840	2016-02-27T22:54:52	shsron_l keep reading!
shwood	703713121584619520	2016-02-27T22:47:37	TheJadeAria LOL.  Feels that way.
shwood	703712888217665536	2016-02-27T22:46:41	clocksnfeathers smidgey yeah, I could get the disappointment, if I hadn't already been doing it for 2 years.
shwood	703712668654260224	2016-02-27T22:45:49	dadams815 sounds like work.
shwood	703712626254057472	2016-02-27T22:45:39	JCMonkeyD3 *hugs*
shwood	703712602132578304	2016-02-27T22:45:33	NickMcPherson2 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
shwood	703711769726836737	2016-02-27T22:42:14	JCMonkeyD3 specifics needed plz
shwood	703711678756577280	2016-02-27T22:41:53	clintmilner yup
shwood	703711161494011904	2016-02-27T22:39:49	dadams815 yes.  But man... oh, man if I could just crack that code...
shwood	703710681611145216	2016-02-27T22:37:55	JCMonkeyD3 that's (give or take) exactly what we're doing. And have done most fridays for 2 years.  What's different?
shwood	703710341335638016	2016-02-27T22:36:34	tomwdart accurate.
shwood	703710278710497280	2016-02-27T22:36:19	clintmilner well, this is like the total reverse:  they're mad because I DIDN'T expose this effect.
shwood	703709119471943680	2016-02-27T22:31:43	joshlama last week.
shwood	703709087742058496	2016-02-27T22:31:35	Mitzula AHH!  I CAN'T WIN!!
shwood	703709037536219136	2016-02-27T22:31:23	ZebPike I like your style, sir.
shwood	703708965788524544	2016-02-27T22:31:06	wtfomg18 Shipping is stupid expensive.  Try checkout, and if it's too much, write Jon at scamstuffstore@gmail.com and we'll see what to do.
shwood	703708795893985280	2016-02-27T22:30:25	tomwdart yeah, but none of the negative comments are from those guys.  they're all self-avowed "former fans" of the channel.
shwood	703708634711130114	2016-02-27T22:29:47	Mitzula lol, that's the thing:  It's the refusal to expose that's getting the pitchforks out!
shwood	703707812170313728	2016-02-27T22:26:31	I suspect this is a big part of it. 
shwood	703707523593797632	2016-02-27T22:25:22	vincent404 you see the effect?  It's totally not.
shwood	703707343020687360	2016-02-27T22:24:39	SkookumTheHyena yeah, but that's just not treating them like people, which makes me uncomfortable.
shwood	703707247554080768	2016-02-27T22:24:16	theleechguy hah
shwood	703707162942402560	2016-02-27T22:23:56	NLamerante of course!  email me at brian@shwood.com
shwood	703707054129590272	2016-02-27T22:23:30	Right. But we didn't show how to do "Nate Staniforth's Lottery Illusion" or "Brian Brushwood's SIMPATICO" either. 
shwood	703706607696220160	2016-02-27T22:21:44	We've done them weekly for nearly 2 years:   
shwood	703706320919089152	2016-02-27T22:20:35	not this time.  now they're calling that response "smug." 
shwood	703706204187394048	2016-02-27T22:20:07	GreatSwordNH LOL
shwood	703706166287736832	2016-02-27T22:19:58	freakin_frankie not a one.  They're all from "true fans who used to love this channel until it turned into nothing but ads"
shwood	703705980622639105	2016-02-27T22:19:14	I'd like to think so, but in that case, how do I set expectations for newbies? 
shwood	703705807074959360	2016-02-27T22:18:33	Man, I'd hate to be so reductionist, but I'm really getting that vibe. I don't know that anything I say would work. 
shwood	703705616766795776	2016-02-27T22:17:47	Eh.  Anyway, here's the vid where we announce the trick and giveaway:  
shwood	703705423048650752	2016-02-27T22:17:01	Should we, like, take a gentle hand and warn them "be cool, but someone, somewhere is about to buy something"?
shwood	703705185038643200	2016-02-27T22:16:04	Is it just that the video is more popular than most? Maybe more people who aren't regular fans are tuning in?
shwood	703705000678019072	2016-02-27T22:15:21	I really can't tell what's different, outside that it's a more popular video.  But there's tons of "boo! sellout!" comments.
shwood	703704884328042496	2016-02-27T22:14:53	we've done giveaways on  for 2 years now.  But something about this week's has a few people fired up.
shwood	703704735489007616	2016-02-27T22:14:17	Hey guys-- could I get your opinion on something? (warning:  tweet flood in 3, 2, 1...)
shwood	703677329269108736	2016-02-27T20:25:23	@Gabecm so if it makes people happy, I’m happy to do it.
shwood	703677270267863040	2016-02-27T20:25:09	@Gabecm yeah, what tips the scales for me is that fans feel super honored with a follow, and it only costs me the effort of managing lists.
shwood	703676993322119168	2016-02-27T20:24:03	TrxylerIsReal can’t speak for the others, but in my case I was taking a gamble you might be a fan… Did I miss the mark?
shwood	703676879509725184	2016-02-27T20:23:36	doctor_doge indeed you are now!
shwood	703676377229230080	2016-02-27T20:21:36	Balk7Official why, thank you
shwood	703610935311663104	2016-02-27T16:01:34	@Gabecm I rarely look at the main feed (it's a stream of insanity). Instead I do various lists and mostly respond to at-replies.

shwood	700449954112798720	2016-02-18T22:40:57	TheDavidRangel oh, shit.  Did Tom die?
shwood	700448715660603393	2016-02-18T22:36:02	baloney_ninja IT'S NOT TOO LATE!
shwood	700420375650267136	2016-02-18T20:43:25	Cinch188O … Sounds like you might have a little bit of reading to do on the subject.
shwood	700416374640742400	2016-02-18T20:27:31	Cinch188O yes, but Apple doesn't have the key, or any way to get in.
shwood	700412063831584768	2016-02-18T20:10:23	VicVinegarII specifically: it sounds like you're under the impression that Apple has the key, or even a way to get in.  They do not.
shwood	700411887297495040	2016-02-18T20:09:41	EionScyne heh.  Lemme take a look.
shwood	700411824257142784	2016-02-18T20:09:26	VicVinegarII again:  not what they're asking for.
shwood	700411351437455360	2016-02-18T20:07:33	RjR_Squared thanks!

shwood	700410705812389890	2016-02-18T20:04:59	OnyxWizard nice!
shwood	700406586297061377	2016-02-18T19:48:37	BoomerBarry yeah, it's a bit more complicated than that:  
shwood	700406394948747264	2016-02-18T19:47:52	Cinch188O Sounds like you might not realize what Apple's actually being asked to do:  
shwood	700405119305658368	2016-02-18T19:42:47	VicVinegarII here's a pretty good analysis:  
shwood	700404947276312576	2016-02-18T19:42:06	VicVinegarII (Just like they can't compel a locksmith to break a lock they want to bypass)
shwood	700404838287298560	2016-02-18T19:41:40	VicVinegarII And the government is allowed to do whatever they want with it.  But they can't compel Apple to break in on their behalf.
shwood	700361753176076288	2016-02-18T16:50:28	KeenanLonell agreed

shwood	696367591225368576	2016-02-07T16:19:06	JoeyLWyatt how about heckling over twitter?  Is that cutting edge and rad?
shwood	696353794125406208	2016-02-07T15:24:16	FmHolty that's an odd way to spell "clueless"
shwood	696353309733433344	2016-02-07T15:22:21	aebyeg antoinewilson heh.  Good point.
shwood	696352596060078082	2016-02-07T15:19:31	geofftru sure thing!

shwood	696178569559445504	2016-02-07T03:48:00	Why it's OK to say "super bowl" even in an ad. 
shwood	696178818910846976	2016-02-07T03:48:59	WillKPlay that 40-second delay is brutal.
shwood	696164030411444224	2016-02-07T02:50:13	imVishal_g sure thing.
shwood	696161920370409472	2016-02-07T02:41:50	imVishal_g cool stuff.
shwood	696160989901824000	2016-02-07T02:38:08	imVishal_g interesting stuff.  Where were these collected from?

shwood	696137829735231488	2016-02-07T01:06:06	Riley20142 nothing on the calendar at the moment... but keep an eye out.
shwood	696137660641882112	2016-02-07T01:05:26	ItMightBeKyle invisiblewife not really.  They were generally very accommodating.

shwood	696120969123930112	2016-02-06T23:59:06	VicVinegarII haha!
shwood	696115086134411264	2016-02-06T23:35:44	PhilipAShane I assume so (though you wouldn't know it from the way twitter is howling)
shwood	696114990458097664	2016-02-06T23:35:21	akalashnikovm no idea... keep me posted on whatever you find out!

shwood	696107211475406848	2016-02-06T23:04:26	hah!  that's awesome. 
shwood	696089479988154368	2016-02-06T21:53:59	legion_bunny can't speak for the others, but in my case I took a gamble that you might be a fan (based on who you follow)... was I right?
shwood	696087194579001344	2016-02-06T21:44:54	skyjack thanks, man!
shwood	696083988306223105	2016-02-06T21:32:10	skyjack awful lot of operations in there...
shwood	696082285976662016	2016-02-06T21:25:24	brycas (but you wont be able to.  That case is pure swiss cheese and airflow :-)
shwood	696082148755832832	2016-02-06T21:24:51	brycas Here's my offer:  we'll move the monitor the second you can point to a single component even slightly over normal temp.
shwood	696081940940607488	2016-02-06T21:24:01	SteveDaly15 hi_jmp it'd also make live production virtually impossible.  Weirdly, all 9 monitors are displaying important stuff.
shwood	696065023290912768	2016-02-06T20:16:48	I dunno...Sometimes I just worry that I don't have enough computers and monitors. 
shwood	695998640511279104	2016-02-06T15:53:01	icu hah!  Touche'.

shwood	695817145234563072	2016-02-06T03:51:49	freakin_frankie so happy to hear that, man.  I'm never sure if what I'm doing is "real work" or not.
shwood	695817025227087876	2016-02-06T03:51:21	evanskylucas awesome!  which year?
shwood	695816994373775360	2016-02-06T03:51:13	Wondering why the twitterverse is fired up? I'm pretty sure it's because they're afraid this is our future: 
shwood	695815525188788224	2016-02-06T03:45:23	colums_world Angry.  and adorable.
shwood	695815441927647232	2016-02-06T03:45:03	flambeau_time 
shwood	695815404191485958	2016-02-06T03:44:54	tehmarken no doubt.  Facebook has shown incredible acumen at maximizing benefit to its investors.  Unrelatedly: I hate facebook.
shwood	695815062909374464	2016-02-06T03:43:33	RealMetman then don't wait!  Jump in the best parts asap:  
shwood	695814738790342657	2016-02-06T03:42:15	GeekCons well, sure.  Just like you can get your news from what people are talking about in a chat room.  no need to mix everything up.

shwood	695814332127399936	2016-02-06T03:40:39	JAsanmateo of course not.  That's the beauty of me not having a dime invested in this thing.
shwood	695814087062614016	2016-02-06T03:39:40	edwardkoenning heh.
shwood	695814019689484288	2016-02-06T03:39:24	Black_Fangz if i'm making a wish?  exactly as they have.  but it's not my call, and they have investors to please.  So we'll see.

shwood	695813493585391616	2016-02-06T03:37:19	(...says the person who stands to benefit from such an alteration.  But goddammit, Twitter's the last clubhouse I have left!)
shwood	695813328669552641	2016-02-06T03:36:39	the last thing we need is another goddamned social media platform altering algorithms so the rich get richer.
shwood	695813079125270528	2016-02-06T03:35:40	What is twitter? If it's a news feed, then algorithms make sense...But it's not. Twitter is the world's chat room, and should behave as such

shwood	695812278768128000	2016-02-06T03:32:29	ptorno I pay attention to youuuuuuuuuuuuu!
shwood	695811568047489025	2016-02-06T03:29:40	tehmarken apparently not.  unless there's a completed painting at the end of it, I can get bent.
shwood	695811206515273728	2016-02-06T03:28:13	AmberPlaster Achirality maybe I'm just stuck on the raw numbers of twitch's popularity.  I'll give it a better look.

shwood	695809826769625091	2016-02-06T03:22:44	Brett_moor would love to.  Which school is it?
shwood	695809751473483777	2016-02-06T03:22:26	AmberPlaster Achirality periscope is rad, but not great for discoverability.

shwood	695806800466092032	2016-02-06T03:10:43	Chimaera96 equally valid point.
shwood	695806584216137728	2016-02-06T03:09:51	Davis_404 accurate.
shwood	695806514477473792	2016-02-06T03:09:35	MattASV1 love that stuff!
shwood	695805168491757568	2016-02-06T03:04:14	question4thunt they're still doing the show, and I think they're shooting in a few months.  Hit up the production folks.
shwood	695803800213278720	2016-02-06T02:58:48	kdegeek NightAttackShow wow!
shwood	695803690234413056	2016-02-06T02:58:21	wow.  This is actually pretty profound. Exactly how I feel. cc: Twitch 
shwood	695803492569522176	2016-02-06T02:57:34	LivPratyush back to where?
shwood	695803426853117952	2016-02-06T02:57:19	MarshallRodriq that 30-40 second delay is brutal.
shwood	695801642139021312	2016-02-06T02:50:13	CrashKinkaide I can only hope!
shwood	695801096548188160	2016-02-06T02:48:03	Achirality it's the same platform, with the same architecture, made by the same employees.  Only the branding has changed.
shwood	695800578002145280	2016-02-06T02:45:59	eriklopez lol
shwood	695800350993846272	2016-02-06T02:45:05	Achirality beg pardon, but my type of content was BORN on this exact platform (...until it changed and kicked me out. And then got popular)
shwood	695799936248459264	2016-02-06T02:43:26	curley giggleloop oh, I'll meat their terms.  Like a tasty chateaubriand... or a fat slab of bacon...
shwood	695799463063851008	2016-02-06T02:41:33	curley giggleloop see?  This is why I'm afraid!
shwood	695798864066969600	2016-02-06T02:39:11	giggleloop heh.  We'll see! &lt;&gt;
shwood	695798706126229505	2016-02-06T02:38:33	BaronVonGrant good point.
shwood	695798479151431680	2016-02-06T02:37:39	giggleloop eh, I agree... but would they?
shwood	695797861766672385	2016-02-06T02:35:12	Jvphobic that 30-40 second lag is insufferable :-(
shwood	695796781083267073	2016-02-06T02:30:54	brycas but it is.  I can't invest if they're going to stand behind their threat to pull the plug on non-gaming shit.
shwood	695796179251044352	2016-02-06T02:28:31	Afal dammit.  
shwood	695796003522252801	2016-02-06T02:27:49	curley DemonFive because... our fans are super-rad?  (also, let's not mention DDOS'ing again.)

shwood	695794389679869952	2016-02-06T02:21:24	Valid point.  There's a special breed of rad-ass unicorns we got in the  chat. 
shwood	695794194607001600	2016-02-06T02:20:37	That's part of why I'm butthurt. I had custom emotes under , but was unceremoniously dumped. 
shwood	695793761419276289	2016-02-06T02:18:54	@FurryBitz yeah, but they still have to pretend to be about gaming, right?
shwood	695793596318900224	2016-02-06T02:18:15	Slapshotkl yeah, but I don't know that "horseshitting around the internet" yet qualifies as a "creative" channel.
shwood	695793467960664065	2016-02-06T02:17:44	No, I don't. That's dumb, and you should feel dumb. You're a terrible bot.  I'm sorry, you're a "less awesome" bot. 
shwood	695793251647795201	2016-02-06T02:16:53	yeah, but they also are constantly threatening to cancel me for not playing games, which is less cool. 
shwood	695793111511879681	2016-02-06T02:16:19	well, that's direct. 
shwood	695793023213395972	2016-02-06T02:15:58	curley yeah, but I feel like there's a louder party next door with people who'd dig our shit, no?

shwood	693821292701585408	2016-01-31T15:41:01	MANvsGAME also, I probably shouldn't have shared that lil' life hack in public.  But screw it, you're family.
shwood	693821122656112640	2016-01-31T15:40:20	MANvsGAME In my case: I asked the fans to make fake Brian Brushwood accounts, then loudly complained about ALL THESE FAKES! BOOM, verified.

shwood	693806552591904769	2016-01-31T14:42:27	OfficialMenzeta oh, no: I thought it was a fine sentiment.  I just thought it apropos that you used the word “react” they’re trademarking.

shwood	693690790187380736	2016-01-31T07:02:27	Oh, Brian. I assume you're saying both sides seem to be a bit overblown, and you're looking for the truth inbetween.

shwood	693688446401978369	2016-01-31T06:53:08	Someone explain to me what the Fine Bros were thinking.  Someone else explain why it's worse than AIDS.

shwood	693287890994860033	2016-01-30T04:21:28	kid_kansas sounds like you gotta come out for the next scam school shoot!
shwood	693287568536793088	2016-01-30T04:20:11	@celttyger thanks so much.  NA is so honest and flawed… It’s probably the most artistically pure thing I’ve ever done. Glad you like it.
