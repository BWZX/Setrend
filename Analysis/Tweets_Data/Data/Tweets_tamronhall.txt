tamronhall	704455846130896897	2016-02-29T23:58:56	It was the pesky ear piece you know the one where you can't hear David Duke or KKK.

tamronhall	703764031660761091	2016-02-28T02:09:55	My tweet regarding being "done" is related to back and forth on Twitter. MHarrisPerry and JoyAnnReid do have voices at any table.
tamronhall	703763739661565952	2016-02-28T02:08:45	Not sure who is stirring this pot but it was reported by CNNMoney I've filled in for MHPshow that is not true not once.
