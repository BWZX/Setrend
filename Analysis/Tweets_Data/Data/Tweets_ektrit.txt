ektrit	725238126860365825	2016-04-27T08:20:18	All in all, wide spread rejection of Orthodox faith in east Europe and slow spread expansion in English speaking areas.
ektrit	725237575062020097	2016-04-27T08:18:06	It is strange how traditional orthodox like Greeks and Russians are now openly atheists and the faith has moved to English speaking places
ektrit	725237246236958720	2016-04-27T08:16:48	However I see great future in USA and Canada for the Orthodox faith.
ektrit	725236965826809856	2016-04-27T08:15:41	The reason is Anglicans are dying, soon those of Anglican faith will look for another place to go to. Orthodox church seems the right fit.
ektrit	725236580894556160	2016-04-27T08:14:09	Looking around Europe about my faith, I see only disaster, except for UK. That is a bright spot.
ektrit	725236296646561792	2016-04-27T08:13:02	As far as East Europe, Russians and Serbs are using the faith as a tool to exterminate other nations, hence the status is even bleaker
ektrit	725235856911568897	2016-04-27T08:11:17	Greeks voting atheist Syriza into power twice means that the status of Orthodox faith in the Balkans is bleak.  Only few people care.
