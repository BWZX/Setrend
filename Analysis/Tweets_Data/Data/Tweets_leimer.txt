leimer	720078022053871617	2016-04-13T02:35:53	Conversational commerce c. 2016 feels a lot like buy buttons c. 2014, in-store mobile payments c. 2011 and on-demand delivery c. 2001.
leimer	720056855926452224	2016-04-13T01:11:47	Something else launched in 2007...now what product was that? ü§î  But, of course...  
leimer	719761821494738944	2016-04-12T05:39:25	Facebook has always excelled at surfing user behaviour. Less so at directing it, perhaps. Interesting to see if that changes.
leimer	719857095739314176	2016-04-12T11:58:00	Globally, the gap between rich and poor is shrinking. Visible here in life expectancy. 
leimer	720008107888279553	2016-04-12T21:58:04	So, Facebook has made its play to move interaction up the stack. Next, we see Google &amp; Apple's ideas to move it down the stack
leimer	720008419625709568	2016-04-12T21:59:19	Unlike previous efforts (Home, deep linking), Messenger isn't an attempt to do something the OS makers can control. Plays to FB strengths
leimer	720008931892789248	2016-04-12T22:01:21	I want to see how (if) Apple puts Pay on the web &amp; how it links that with identity. Right on the edge of Apple's comfort zone, easy to fail
leimer	720010273612955648	2016-04-12T22:06:41	Bots meet cards. Move on from dumb web views. Break binary 'is the app installed' problem.
leimer	720013654733623296	2016-04-12T22:20:07	What we didn't have: messaging services with user bases in the billions... 
leimer	720044495979479040	2016-04-13T00:22:40	Problem: home screens have too many icons for different services Solution: build new runtime inside an app Soon: that app has too many icons
leimer	720044688783192065	2016-04-13T00:23:26	A big question for any search/discovery/acquisition story: are you solving a problem or just moving it to a different UI?
leimer	720045906431639552	2016-04-13T00:28:16	2005: "search for us on Google" 2010: "search for us in the App Store" 2016: "search for us in Messenger"
leimer	720049793095979008	2016-04-13T00:43:43	We've mostly solved 'give me this specific thing I know I like' online. 'Show me something I didn't know I'd like' is another matter
leimer	720050148907155458	2016-04-13T00:45:08	Facebook has solved 'I'm bored - show me something a sample of 200 people in my demo might like'. That's not discovery.
leimer	720051166260760576	2016-04-13T00:49:10	Hence: are you solving discovery, or just moving it, and substituting a different gatekeeper?
leimer	720050819299577856	2016-04-13T00:47:47	The Internet makes it possible to get everything you know you want, but impossible to know about everything you would want
leimer	720048223440625664	2016-04-13T00:37:28	In a sense, the Internet has always been the command line. But 'what should I type?' changed from a technical problem to a marketing one
leimer	720052890740477952	2016-04-13T00:56:01	More data than anyone else was a part of Google's lead in search. Now, data land-grabs in self-driving and anything you can apply ML to
leimer	720025639793745920	2016-04-12T23:07:44	Yep, creditkarma just killing it... 
leimer	720015318328942592	2016-04-12T22:26:43	Also interesting, how Bots will positively affect Stripe's business. Huge market opportunity, I assume was unanticipated.
leimer	720014248068444164	2016-04-12T22:22:28	Bots in WhatsApp; that's going to change everything.
leimer	720012640639131648	2016-04-12T22:16:05	Google Search, and Siri. Interested to see how bots will affect these two in the next few years.
leimer	720011362718642176	2016-04-12T22:11:00	Messaging bots will clean up mobile screen space. A large number of apps are ideal to be just bots in messaging rather than standalone apps.
