HonestToddler	682368711530000384	2015-12-31T01:12:33	I love falling asleep in a pitch black room alone. It's like Russian orphanage cosplay.
HonestToddler	682368484462956549	2015-12-31T01:11:39	No need to sing to me either. The haunting melody of your abandonment is the only soundtrack I need.
HonestToddler	682368194217177088	2015-12-31T01:10:29	Who needs bedtime stories when the heartbreaking sounds of my own sobbing can lull me into a fitful sleep?
HonestToddler	682367742809387009	2015-12-31T01:08:42	No no don't worry about a bedtime story. I'll just fill in the gaps in my imagination with hard drugs.

HonestToddler	682252090211741696	2015-12-30T17:29:08	If she starts giving out cooking advice, I'm cutting the line. The only thing she makes regularly is rum &amp; coke.
HonestToddler	682248964255670272	2015-12-30T17:16:43	Yet you call on her for advice.
HonestToddler	682248914687389696	2015-12-30T17:16:31	The closest I've come to a craft today is watching her febreeze her leggings.
HonestToddler	682248047242428420	2015-12-30T17:13:04	Can't wait to hear her lie about crafts we're not doing.
HonestToddler	682246596822757376	2015-12-30T17:07:18	She'll be on Radio Canada at 4pm talking about winter break activities for kids which is funny because I'm on hour 1,400 of Netflix.
HonestToddler	682242019088056320	2015-12-30T16:49:07	Look into his eyes and tell me he's not thinking about beer battering these kids. 
HonestToddler	682240566810247168	2015-12-30T16:43:21	You can see in his eyes that he wants to dip them in ranch. 
HonestToddler	682239454749298688	2015-12-30T16:38:56	Shout out to Barney for staying strong despite those kids smelling like bbq wings to him.
