rabois	705422945426931713	2016-03-03T16:01:50	hunterwalk and as msquinn notes, what is the alternative??
rabois	705422521797992448	2016-03-03T16:00:09	hunterwalk I think she wants to be perceived as approachable and not a stiff.
rabois	705422341954629632	2016-03-03T15:59:27	dhaber as Moritz advised in a 2006, you are a star in SV when everyone refers to u by just your first name.
rabois	705422087398096896	2016-03-03T15:58:26	hunterwalk yes but her campaign will spoon feed them the correct reference.
rabois	705421712641249280	2016-03-03T15:56:57	msquinn hunterwalk yes I actually believe her campaign prefers this Hillary which is why the media adopts it.
rabois	705421390732615680	2016-03-03T15:55:40	hunterwalk what about Jeb! and the Donald is used frequently.
rabois	705416130257551361	2016-03-03T15:34:46	JoeNBC absent an endorsement or a brilliant new attack vector on Trump this speech will be a massive mistake.
rabois	705411747385966592	2016-03-03T15:17:21	ampressman they have co-operated in unlocking devices before.
rabois	705273899966070785	2016-03-03T06:09:35	kswint johnolilly bycoffe Trump has the least delegates of any frontrunner at this point in modern history.
rabois	705266974461284352	2016-03-03T05:42:04	andrewmutz yes but if he selects the right VP it will be and this is from the left wing media
rabois	705264239796092928	2016-03-03T05:31:12	PatrickRuffini agree, but maybe he aims for 2nd in Michigan too?
rabois	705264097877594112	2016-03-03T05:30:38	mkjung yes, Trump wins Ohio w Kasich as VP and wins Florida and he is President.
rabois	705263106352508928	2016-03-03T05:26:42	jason_pontin true, but independents are voting for him now in droves and HRC will repel independents.
rabois	705262187615367168	2016-03-03T05:23:03	PatrickRuffini agreed, they will be complacent and follow a traditional playbook.
rabois	705261953678094336	2016-03-03T05:22:07	jason_pontin HRC's unfavorables are literally identical to Trump's.
rabois	705261816717266944	2016-03-03T05:21:34	PatrickRuffini I agree with you that there is also much greater risk that he doesn't beat HRC than with other GOP choices.
rabois	705261537620070400	2016-03-03T05:20:28	jason_pontin very, she will be shredded.
rabois	705261330698149888	2016-03-03T05:19:39	PatrickRuffini  the reason to defeat Trump isn't because he can't beat HRC, it is because he is wrong on most policies, unstable, immoral.
rabois	705260196382138369	2016-03-03T05:15:08	Even the left Establishment is recognizing that Trump is more likely than not to beat HRC:  
rabois	705253997515374593	2016-03-03T04:50:30	Khanoisseur i don't think so.  He may actually be helping Trump.

rabois	705239072797634561	2016-03-03T03:51:12	richard_wakeel well, as you may have noticed in the poll, 51% actually wanted non-tech so i try to mix tech, sports and politics.
rabois	705234795018596352	2016-03-03T03:34:12	richard_wakeel I actually used to be more of an expert on politics (and law) than tech.
rabois	705233950432604160	2016-03-03T03:30:51	richard_wakeel last time I ran a poll, followers wanted 49% technology, and then sports at 27% and politics at 24%.
rabois	705232960673357824	2016-03-03T03:26:55	Ironically, figuring out what vector to attack Trump on is almost an n*p problem.

rabois	705181848821891072	2016-03-03T00:03:49	jtbatson true. here is the data set for you:  
rabois	705181695411027968	2016-03-03T00:03:12	LucasPattan AndrewSweet abrams read the substance.
rabois	705180909356474369	2016-03-03T00:00:05	GregGoodfried still a real shot.
rabois	705180874510217216	2016-03-02T23:59:56	jtbatson read this:  
rabois	705180834039353344	2016-03-02T23:59:47	LucasPattan  FYI why your analysis is incorrect is explained here (which tracks the views of all political pros);  
rabois	705179814932541440	2016-03-02T23:55:44	fmanjoo it means the candidate is bereft of ideas.
rabois	705179712113418241	2016-03-02T23:55:19	jtbatson unlikely, but keep your hope alive :)
rabois	705179452901236737	2016-03-02T23:54:17	LucasPattan abrams I have hope that Trump won't get to 1237.
rabois	705178817187356673	2016-03-02T23:51:46	LucasPattan abrams I believe we won in 2000.
rabois	705178610164826112	2016-03-02T23:50:56	LucasPattan abrams want to bet on Donald shredding HRC?  or will she be indicted before then?
rabois	705178190566653952	2016-03-02T23:49:16	GregGoodfried he isn't winning Republicans, he is winning independents.
rabois	705177962480414722	2016-03-02T23:48:22	GregGoodfried LOL.  Every poll shows her unfavorables are as bad as Trump's and unlike The Donald she has no room to improve them.
rabois	705177330147160064	2016-03-02T23:45:51	GregGoodfried keep believing that.  Donald has major issues, but shredding HRC will be easy for him.
rabois	705176794077405184	2016-03-02T23:43:43	An omen.

rabois	705164846988267520	2016-03-02T22:56:15	morganwarstler yes no chance
rabois	705164715958272000	2016-03-02T22:55:44	Contrary to the media narrative, Trump currently has less delegates at this stage of the primaries than any GOP front runner historically.

rabois	705163991341887488	2016-03-02T22:52:51	michael_boswell I have some terms for you.
rabois	705162716239892480	2016-03-02T22:47:47	100% true. 
rabois	705161737431986176	2016-03-02T22:43:54	An optimistic anti-coronation of Trump perspective. 
rabois	705160129612611585	2016-03-02T22:37:30	5. By keeping Trump viable for another two weeks, it makes it virtually impossible for him to run as an independent.
rabois	705159943830183936	2016-03-02T22:36:46	michael_boswell any GOP candidate can beat HRC.
rabois	705103647202357250	2016-03-02T18:53:04	5.  More of the upcoming primaries are "closed" and Trump has lost virtually all of those.
rabois	705102877480452096	2016-03-02T18:50:00	4. Cruz needs to find a state to target for a win, not clear what his next best shot is.
rabois	705102556897251328	2016-03-02T18:48:44	3. If Trump loses Ohio &amp; Florida, open convention is highly likely. And candidate who loses Texas Ohio FL &amp; likely CA isn't so compelling.
rabois	705101907518291968	2016-03-02T18:46:09	2. Kasich and Rubio performed well enough to justify their constituents voting for them in Ohio and Florida races (vs just a protest vote).
rabois	705101637644226560	2016-03-02T18:45:05	1.  Most important implication of yesterday's results: Trump cannot afford to skip tomorrow's debate (which he was planning to do)

rabois	704888949097934849	2016-03-02T04:39:56	Impressive. 
rabois	704883645094486016	2016-03-02T04:18:51	Cruz and Rubio together have won more votes and more delegates than Trump so far. So they just have to combine. Simple. Cruz-Rubio 2016. QED
rabois	704887176819920896	2016-03-02T04:32:53	danielrakh that could be smart but I suspect she needs to appease the left.

rabois	704746716319260672	2016-03-01T19:14:45	kevinmarks see also the tweet re square, which is now accelerating ApplePay usage :)
rabois	704746449381109761	2016-03-01T19:13:41	mporat why? It is a novel product so it should be compared to the iPhone or iPod.
rabois	704746313716338689	2016-03-01T19:13:09	kevinmarks see the first tweet in the thread you cite
rabois	704745871573790721	2016-03-01T19:11:23	mporat yes. Already outpacing the iPhone.

rabois	704744957521711104	2016-03-01T19:07:46	kevinmarks 85% time on mobile is now apps. And what fraction of consumer usage is mobile v desktop? 60? 70? 80?

rabois	701233121836945408	2016-02-21T02:32:59	ClarkeMoore PatrickRuffini but the media can't succeed w this. Needs to come from candidates directly or credible conservative officials.
rabois	701232549108928512	2016-02-21T02:30:42	The idea that you can beat Trump without directly framing the anti Trump argument is either brilliant or very naive.

rabois	701231854762876928	2016-02-21T02:27:57	jameshritz agree but not sure they have much power or influence left.
rabois	701231142364540928	2016-02-21T02:25:07	nxthompson yes but Jeb could still be the VP candidate.

rabois	701230764982013952	2016-02-21T02:23:37	jameshritz logical but VERY complicated.
rabois	701230484630564865	2016-02-21T02:22:30	mattyglesias not likely to work.
rabois	701230123962355712	2016-02-21T02:21:04	BrettRichey all campaign tracking polls indicated this
rabois	701229641202204673	2016-02-21T02:19:09	BrettRichey he was actually adding 1-2% per day and on track to win
rabois	701226028463599617	2016-02-21T02:04:47	Debates obviously matter.  Bad performance doomed Rubio in NH (which he was tracking to win) and Cruz in SC.
rabois	701208210900791296	2016-02-21T00:53:59	conorsen plus he still is most likely to beat Trump
rabois	701207944277262336	2016-02-21T00:52:56	conorsen that doesn't make sense if Ted keeps finishing above him in every state?
rabois	701207655126163456	2016-02-21T00:51:47	conorsen how do you see Rubio winning?  At the convention?
rabois	701207381087121409	2016-02-21T00:50:42	gregbettinelli yes it saved GWB
rabois	701206981000867840	2016-02-21T00:49:06	gregbettinelli can't feign enthusiasm when it doesn't exist.
rabois	701206472651223040	2016-02-21T00:47:05	gregbettinelli the pattern is GOP record everywhere and low/mediocre Democrat participation everywhere.
rabois	701206261715464197	2016-02-21T00:46:15	aberoyce fair but when one party is setting turnout records everywhere and the other is losing interest it projects to the general.
rabois	701206093024743425	2016-02-21T00:45:35	ffumarola it certainly makes it possible to beat him by narrowing the field.
rabois	701205934773637120	2016-02-21T00:44:57	craig_montuori wrong.  The GOP is setting a new historical record high in virtually every state.  Dems are below 2008 everywhere.
rabois	701205679764189184	2016-02-21T00:43:56	WellspringGP perhaps although clearly Carson handicaps Cruz and Bush voters are 80% or more non Trump.
rabois	701205480597630977	2016-02-21T00:43:08	ffumarola yes but it depends where the 1% is from.
rabois	701205369310216192	2016-02-21T00:42:42	Notwithstanding issues with Trump as the nominee, this is a great sign that the GOP is going to destroy HRC. 
rabois	701204831600390145	2016-02-21T00:40:34	stogachess much closer finish even if he wins.
rabois	701204658337918976	2016-02-21T00:39:52	But if Trump is sub 30% it should be an omen.
rabois	701204340715843584	2016-02-21T00:38:37	Not completely buying the accuracy of these exit polls, yet.
rabois	701203604602884097	2016-02-21T00:35:41	bebrown2 yes GOP Party donors

rabois	701154833785425920	2016-02-20T21:21:53	adustoor you are tweeting to early.  Best case is Trump wins today by a small margin, more likely a vey close batch with Cruz/Rubio.

rabois	701117375232389120	2016-02-20T18:53:03	bilalfarooqui mathewi especially without evidence that Yelp is below par on some comp metric.
rabois	701114346743595009	2016-02-20T18:41:00	mathewi people shouldn't tweet on topics they are ignorant about, and where they have bias.
rabois	701112777914470400	2016-02-20T18:34:46	mathewi he refused to answer this simple question which is classic evidence of trolling (or just stupidity) 
rabois	701112307804274688	2016-02-20T18:32:54	narendra yelp is hiring. No am sure you can help.
rabois	701112204712521728	2016-02-20T18:32:30	mathewi I can't imagine a neutral person connecting those points, especially sans evidence that yelp pays below others, likely pays more.
rabois	701111561251717120	2016-02-20T18:29:56	mathewi do u disagree with my point that citing NPS as evidence in a compensation discussion is an act of trolling?
rabois	701111059201953792	2016-02-20T18:27:57	narendra well the whole debate was about compensation so I don't see how NPS was relevant expect to troll.
rabois	701110839315574784	2016-02-20T18:27:04	ThibeauB12 Oracle NPS is also very low.  High market cap and high compensation
rabois	701110102888058882	2016-02-20T18:24:09	narendra When you serve interests of consumers this is the result by those being reviewed. But more important, it has nothing to do w comp.
rabois	701108787478790144	2016-02-20T18:18:55	ThibeauB12 is there any evidence that CS people at yelp have low morale? I have  yet to see him or her marshal evidence of that.
rabois	701108588958187520	2016-02-20T18:18:08	jden415 sometimes yes sometimes no, but the consumer NPS would be the goal not Business owner NPS.
rabois	701108367977115649	2016-02-20T18:17:15	ThibeauB12 that is like desperately seeking for some data and hoping it correlates.
rabois	701107398430167041	2016-02-20T18:13:24	jden415 kevinmarks yes that is precisely what he did.  In addition, NPS of small businesses is not the relevant metric for Yelp.
rabois	701107163305869312	2016-02-20T18:12:28	ThibeauB12 to start, NPS scores have no relationship to compensation.  I am confident the NPS of Goldman Sachs isn't great but they pay $.
rabois	701106853539762177	2016-02-20T18:11:14	jden415 kevinmarks it is fucking stupid metric for analyzing the comp structure for entry employees.
rabois	701106699503931392	2016-02-20T18:10:37	mathewi for example, is there any evidence that yelp pays CS reps less than Google, for example?
rabois	701105974036160513	2016-02-20T18:07:44	mathewi he is trolling to protect his employer.
rabois	701105425458941953	2016-02-20T18:05:33	mathewi worse than a troll.  Biased too.
rabois	701105341925187584	2016-02-20T18:05:14	kevinmarks you had no data.  An NPS score is about as relevant as Trump's poll data.
rabois	701102948378550272	2016-02-20T17:55:43	kevinmarks you are nothing more than a troll.  Answering trolls w substance is a waste of time.
rabois	701100882436304896	2016-02-20T17:47:30	kevinmarks yes but I am right
rabois	701098538554372096	2016-02-20T17:38:12	kevinmarks that is even a dumber tweet

rabois	701087820048302081	2016-02-20T16:55:36	aronchick mine was $535/mo.
rabois	701086976011669504	2016-02-20T16:52:15	aronchick so many mistakes compounding.  When I graduated law school my first job was $23k net.
rabois	701086121984299008	2016-02-20T16:48:51	aronchick can she work more hours? Take a second job?
rabois	701084741362036736	2016-02-20T16:43:22	aronchick alexrkonrad if you work as many hours as I did when I was a lawyer, even at min wage you earn $33-41 k.
rabois	701083734871703552	2016-02-20T16:39:22	jasonlk yes I can see presenting a 30/50/75 scenario on one slide.
rabois	701083378355843072	2016-02-20T16:37:57	jasonlk 50% is a good target.
rabois	701082410134278144	2016-02-20T16:34:06	kevinmarks underfunded by what metric or standard or benchmark????
rabois	701079648365445120	2016-02-20T16:23:08	hunterwalk indeed it could empirically be wise.
rabois	701079314180079617	2016-02-20T16:21:48	hunterwalk I don't know.  Acquisition occurred after I resigned from Board.
rabois	701079138782740480	2016-02-20T16:21:06	alexrkonrad fortunately, that era is starting to end. The reality is that startups are brutally difficult and rarely successful.
rabois	701078679510581248	2016-02-20T16:19:17	alexrkonrad perhaps.  I ascribe it more to the Hollywood version of a startup that has infected the culture.
rabois	701077596704931840	2016-02-20T16:14:59	alexrkonrad eagerly awaiting your Medium post about the experience.
rabois	701077465238646784	2016-02-20T16:14:27	alexrkonrad want to bet this person was warned?
rabois	701077115794370561	2016-02-20T16:13:04	jasonlk to be honest
rabois	701076679918092289	2016-02-20T16:11:20	alexrkonrad when I was growing up, NYC was just too expensive for many career choices.
rabois	701076475122839553	2016-02-20T16:10:31	alexrkonrad true is most industries, especially journalism and politics.
rabois	701076342226288643	2016-02-20T16:10:00	alexrkonrad fair, although I know many people who run the math before moving, or accepting a job.  Also working multiple jobs is common.
rabois	701074959397859328	2016-02-20T16:04:30	alexrkonrad yet :)
rabois	701074787230097410	2016-02-20T16:03:49	alexrkonrad as an example, let's compare her compensation to the MEDIAN comp in America or the median for journalists?
rabois	701074610217877504	2016-02-20T16:03:07	alexrkonrad true like most fields, including journalism.
rabois	701074327282712576	2016-02-20T16:01:59	alexrkonrad MikeIsaac well her point was Yelp needs to pay her more.  Hard to argue that if they are already paying more than most.
rabois	701073695947694080	2016-02-20T15:59:29	alexrkonrad astounding that people discuss this post w/o asking most obvious question, more likely that yelp pays more than many others.
rabois	701072852716367873	2016-02-20T15:56:08	MikeIsaac alexrkonrad I don't know how the pay compares exactly but before even linking to someone I would ask is it worse than others?
rabois	701072571756773377	2016-02-20T15:55:01	semil yes and you can hire for this.  It needs to be baked into the company's initial DNA.
rabois	701072276855238656	2016-02-20T15:53:50	alexrkonrad MikeIsaac jyarow aren't you guys journalists?  Is there any evidence that yelp pays less than any (or every) other co in SF?
rabois	701071729880248322	2016-02-20T15:51:40	semil that is because they are normally called "founders"
rabois	701070705924804608	2016-02-20T15:47:36	chrisFnicholson I don't disagree.   Losing to Obama is not an embarrassment, losing to Bernie is confirming that she is horrendous.
rabois	701070497157505024	2016-02-20T15:46:46	skhyle yes but she is excusing that as a local favorite.  But you can read my tweet to say she is already on life support.
rabois	701070126884397057	2016-02-20T15:45:18	Eff1ngtonPost Nevada would be devastating

rabois	698635424831418368	2016-02-13T22:30:39	GregGoodfried yes it was a national repudiation of Obama.

rabois	698634331267293184	2016-02-13T22:26:19	gregbettinelli alexrkonrad yes and Bork had the same unanimous support for the same appellate court
rabois	698634226367729664	2016-02-13T22:25:54	alexrkonrad the answer is it depends on which Justice is being replaced.  Ginsberg could have resigned with a 50-50% shot of a replacement.
rabois	698633908569505792	2016-02-13T22:24:38	zamosta Chris Christie
rabois	698633110682935296	2016-02-13T22:21:28	There's no chance this Senate will confirm any Obama pick; but he'll almost surely send one up. Implications of a 4-4 court are enormous.
rabois	698633559376957440	2016-02-13T22:23:15	alexrkonrad gregbettinelli i would say this is what happens when Democrats start the Bork wars.

rabois	698633083940003840	2016-02-13T22:21:21	JJColao alexrkonrad gregbettinelli why?  The people elected a GOP Senate intentionally to stop Obama.
rabois	698632932705988608	2016-02-13T22:20:45	gregbettinelli alexrkonrad that is Obama's best bet (another classmate of mine).  Christie or other GOP politician would be confirmed.

rabois	698630206743977985	2016-02-13T22:09:55	alexrkonrad aren't many examples of Sup Court nominees where other party controls the Senate, especially since Dems politicized post Bork.
rabois	698629374333988864	2016-02-13T22:06:37	alexrkonrad there is literally zero chance before Nov results unless he selects a Republican which would create a bit of a bind.

rabois	696072676754853888	2016-02-06T20:47:13	The biggest reason that nobody under 30 will vote for HRC is that they discovered she uses an Aol email account.
rabois	696070358080720896	2016-02-06T20:38:00	swaaanson semil true, people prefer Cruz 2:1 if there were no other options.

rabois	690339809651507201	2016-01-22T01:06:51	jasonlk that is one of two reasons founders prefer the higher denominated valuation plus liq preference vs lower valuation
rabois	690339467085889536	2016-01-22T01:05:29	jasonlk it is probably more important to preserve a lower 409a valuation.
rabois	690338571228684288	2016-01-22T01:01:55	jasonlk it is about founder choice.  I would extend term sheets today w/o preference and adjust the valuation appropriately.
rabois	690338407860539392	2016-01-22T01:01:16	jasonlk probably 50%
rabois	690337667154866176	2016-01-22T00:58:20	jasonlk we could easily delete these but valuation paid on investments would be cut by meaningful %; This=trade that most founders prefer.
rabois	690297349441134592	2016-01-21T22:18:07	fmanjoo yes but is absolutely essential for Ted and probably triggers a loss in NH for Trump if he loses.
rabois	690296918442815488	2016-01-21T22:16:25	fmanjoo they should.
rabois	690296358238990336	2016-01-21T22:14:11	zamosta because you want to learn?
rabois	690285101846962176	2016-01-21T21:29:27	zamosta False.
rabois	690280124994850816	2016-01-21T21:09:41	zamosta the leadership and establishment has sold out the base for 49 years.  That is why this is occurring. Can't act like Democrats Lite.

rabois	689849524529934336	2016-01-20T16:38:38	GregGoodfried johnolilly she has been wrong on every policy in her career, dishonest, entitled &amp; corrupt.
rabois	689844966009344000	2016-01-20T16:20:31	runvc fmanjoo yes but he needs to win Iowa and the Palin endorsement really affects that.
rabois	689844059393798145	2016-01-20T16:16:55	fmanjoo no it doubled his prospects of winning, at least.

rabois	689701242554028033	2016-01-20T06:49:24	johnolilly that is the least of my problems right now.
rabois	689701043525971968	2016-01-20T06:48:37	johnolilly true, all polls depend on a model of turnout, which could be very wrong.
rabois	689700837963083776	2016-01-20T06:47:48	johnolilly most polls suggest that identification w GOP has improved or been neutral over the Trump run.
rabois	689700357904031744	2016-01-20T06:45:53	johnolilly well, there is evidence that this extra exposure has helped the GOP thus far and def no evidence that it is negative, yet.
rabois	689700103880241152	2016-01-20T06:44:53	syun johnolilly because the only potential voters for him are elites.
rabois	689699805719752705	2016-01-20T06:43:42	johnolilly depends who the nominee is.
rabois	689699725805649920	2016-01-20T06:43:23	johnolilly yes, but he can potentially improve positives (still not *that* well known and etched in voters' minds) whereas she is stuck.
