KenLerer	534805162859446272	2014-11-18T20:27:41	4/ David Plouffe, President Obama’s former Senior Advisor is now with Uber. He must understand how important this is. Why not a word?
KenLerer	534805017094811648	2014-11-18T20:27:06	3/ If Uber were a publicly held company, this Uber exec would be gone already. So who is responsible there? So far no one.
KenLerer	534804913344487424	2014-11-18T20:26:42	2/ That is so insane. It’s more than a slippery slope, it’s a road to ruin.
KenLerer	534804816598663168	2014-11-18T20:26:19	1/ The Uber exec Emil Michael said it was fair game to attack journalists who criticize Uber.
KenLerer	534804703738359809	2014-11-18T20:25:52	Someone smart asked me why do I care so much about this Uber issue. Here is why: it’s all about the journalism.
KenLerer	534738022701727745	2014-11-18T16:00:54	His apology wasn't credible. Anyone who can say the things he said means them.
KenLerer	534737931697922048	2014-11-18T16:00:32	When will Michael resign and/or be asked to step aside?

KenLerer	527166066389417984	2014-10-28T18:32:39	6/ The candidate with the higher NRA grade only won 6 out of these 26 races, or 23% of the time. 
KenLerer	527165891071705088	2014-10-28T18:31:57	5/ Of these 33 races, there were 26 in which the NRA assigned vastly different grades to both candidates, such as a “D” vs. an “A” rating.

KenLerer	527165534379724800	2014-10-28T18:30:32	2/ Ch. 3 Recap: Based on the wide margins of victory, the NRA only affected the outcome in 4 elections bt. ’04 and ’10.
KenLerer	527165384445919233	2014-10-28T18:29:56	1/ Another shooting—this one at a Seattle H.S.—and not a word from Congress because they are afraid of the NRA.
