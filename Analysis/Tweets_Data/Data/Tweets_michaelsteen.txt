michaelsteen	707927132253585408	2016-03-10T13:52:35	LorcanRK yes
michaelsteen	707926251198148608	2016-03-10T13:49:05	Here's the full introductory statement 
michaelsteen	707924389128491008	2016-03-10T13:41:41	Lots of you misheard this: issuer/issue limit change is on securities issued by international organisations and multilateral devlpmnt banks

michaelsteen	707912101604564992	2016-03-10T12:52:52	TheStalwart ecb We only tweeted after the statement was live on the website
michaelsteen	704970059245084672	2016-03-02T10:02:14	schieritz faznet yes, indeed. Did you see my second tweet?
michaelsteen	704959741777281024	2016-03-02T09:21:14	michaelsteen I suspect they actually sold way more newspapers because of ECB - monetary policy is getting interesting these days!
michaelsteen	704959446682886144	2016-03-02T09:20:04	They turned a profit in 2015, happily. But no mention of what role monetary policy played there.
michaelsteen	704958901079384064	2016-03-02T09:17:54	FAZ blames ECB for part of its 2014 â‚¬18m loss. I can't find guaranteeing newspaper profitability in the statutes. 
michaelsteen	703893724393140224	2016-02-28T10:45:16	"Light" in European languages 
michaelsteen	701457519303073792	2016-02-21T17:24:39	Very few cities benefit from the EU more than London. Boris backing Brexit is like the mayor of Chamonix calling for the end of snow.

michaelsteen	694200778282631169	2016-02-01T16:48:57	For non European Parliament experts: this is a plenary session, so after introductory statement  we'll hear from MEPs
