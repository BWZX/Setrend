howardfineman	725919727021776896	2016-04-29T05:28:44	You know what'll happen: CB Bengals (Hamilton Burgers of football) drafted out of spite will fail; guy Steelers settled for will succeed.
howardfineman	725911698465427456	2016-04-29T04:56:50	That's what I figured. They are low rent you-know-what's: it's a Pittsburgh word and it begins with "J." 
howardfineman	725910535296819201	2016-04-29T04:52:13	Yep 
howardfineman	725909591247048704	2016-04-29T04:48:27	Steelers most need secondary players, obvs. They should use a lot of choices on them; perhaps should have traded up for the best of them.

howardfineman	725907074878578688	2016-04-29T04:38:28	Bengals took the corner the Steelers would have preferred. But maybe ArtieBurns has more heart, given what he's had to go through.
howardfineman	725901355911532551	2016-04-29T04:15:44	Yes 2 much perimeter passing &amp; stick work; 2 little going inside for shots &amp; rebounds. Pens faster; Caps tougher.

howardfineman	686411113915912192	2016-01-11T04:55:37	Two other comments: Steelers lucked out getting great kicker Boswell, &amp; MartavisBryant catch one of the most amazing in recent years.
howardfineman	686362174936203264	2016-01-11T01:41:09	Steelers don't have rep as a dirty team &amp; never have. bengals are notorious. Steelers responded -- when pushed.

howardfineman	686250986411814912	2016-01-10T18:19:19	As Pirates' Bob Prince would say, Steelers had 'em all the way! Not really, but ranks w ImmaculateReception,  JamesHarrison's 100 yds.

howardfineman	683511475420409857	2016-01-03T04:53:29	Once again, Steelers are depending at season's end on kindness of strangers. They've no one to blame but themselves. Blew it in Baltimore.

howardfineman	681269299529551872	2015-12-28T00:23:53	Emotion &amp; focus of purpose matter, even if not especially in the pros. We fans know the iffy psychology of our team. 
howardfineman	681268113967546368	2015-12-28T00:19:10	Any Steelers fan knew Ravens game was a trap. Steelers were in playoffs, injuries aside. But they weren't motivated. I blame Tomlin.
howardfineman	681265730495623172	2015-12-28T00:09:42	Steelers blew it, plain and simple. They don't deserve to be in the playoffs. Rothlisberger has been awful; Tomlin hasn't prepared them.
