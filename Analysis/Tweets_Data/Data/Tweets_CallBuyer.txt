CallBuyer	725059714896302082	2016-04-26T20:31:21	Horrible headline numbers.
CallBuyer	725055745033682944	2016-04-26T20:15:35	We will add on any significant AAPL dip if it drops.
CallBuyer	723568765225586689	2016-04-22T17:46:51	AAPL hurting our YTD performance with this pullback. Adding to SBUX here taking our basis up to $56
CallBuyer	717374564284686338	2016-04-05T15:33:18	Minerd, Ralphie, Kass...such great contrarian signals. Not sure if you even need charts with them around.
CallBuyer	716712577598898177	2016-04-03T19:42:49	People have asked if I think markets end red this yr. No. But do believe much better buying opp coming soon. Perhaps buy in May and go away.
CallBuyer	714474617843412993	2016-03-28T15:29:57	sellputs Probably breaks through. 2100s will kill rally if it does. Hasnt broken those levels in 30+ attempts
CallBuyer	714469300178968576	2016-03-28T15:08:50	Have been reducing long exposure for last few days. See current upside only to 2080s at most with downside and chop more likely.
CallBuyer	711925336280272896	2016-03-21T14:40:01	I'm sure that put seller in VRX last week had no idea about today's spectacle.
CallBuyer	705580406167506944	2016-03-04T02:27:32	They are really trying to end Trump tonight. What a show.
CallBuyer	704351075063582720	2016-02-29T17:02:37	Unless playing the very long game, you should be a net seller today. NYMO elevated and stocks seem tired. Small pullback likely.
CallBuyer	703793288550203393	2016-02-28T04:06:10	When did Bloomberg become mostly clickbait listicle nonsense? Did that come with Joe W?
CallBuyer	701499000852185089	2016-02-21T20:09:29	Incredible chart for one of the best value companies you can ever find. AAPL
CallBuyer	701482648481345536	2016-02-21T19:04:30	AAPL weekly chart at long term support area 
CallBuyer	700369155778813953	2016-02-18T17:19:53	All out WYNN $76 from $64-65 buys posted on stream. Will consider rebuying after it pulls back.
CallBuyer	700139647809232896	2016-02-18T02:07:54	JacoboHamui Thank you. But stock normally moves $1-$4 per day. Can't hold for a small div.
CallBuyer	700111505442934784	2016-02-18T00:16:04	WYNN looking a bit overheated short term. Likely to sell tomorrow, if green, from $65 buy. Thanks Steve
CallBuyer	700038078900129793	2016-02-17T19:24:18	Kass the moron out blasting AAPL on small sell by Icahn. He still owns $5b worth. May take our 22% AUM position to 100 just cause of Kass.
CallBuyer	698695015854379008	2016-02-14T02:27:27	It will take a lot more basing and chop (potentially all year) to set up next bull leg. Consolidation already at 18 months and running.
CallBuyer	698694794164465664	2016-02-14T02:26:34	We believe we are very close to the end of this "bear market" (ha). That does not mean equity prices magically rise to to new highs in a day
CallBuyer	697813053765787648	2016-02-11T16:02:51	Just get to the 200 day on the weekly already and let's see how we fair. SPX
CallBuyer	697768933558976512	2016-02-11T13:07:32	Likely to hit double digit drawdown today. Tough, tough environment so far. Great prices for long term, however.
CallBuyer	697025880930050048	2016-02-09T11:54:54	Let's hit the 200ma on the SPX weekly charts and be done with it.
CallBuyer	696089570157404160	2016-02-06T21:54:20	"sell off seems now to be feeding on itself in a self-reinforcing cycle, fund outflows causing sell offs that lead to further fund outflows"
CallBuyer	695830888391774209	2016-02-06T04:46:26	lalaruza74 Lot of the moves today had 20-100% higher volume than 30 day average (which is already elevated).
CallBuyer	695829596944670721	2016-02-06T04:41:18	lalaruza74 Felt like 'capitulation' today. SBUX move was "WTF" Not willing to add to existing positions just yet in case more liquidation.
CallBuyer	695825509289168896	2016-02-06T04:25:03	Momo kings like TSLA PANW and more all finally reaching 30 RSI on weekly charts for first time since 2014. Interesting look.
CallBuyer	695824400747257860	2016-02-06T04:20:39	Not saying anything mind blowing but the liquidation today was incredible. Co's like NVDA, ADBE, GOOG are real companies w/ real profits.
CallBuyer	695036203532423170	2016-02-04T00:08:38	Terrible experience recently through GRUB (Seamless) Probably worth a short on how bad their customer support is.
CallBuyer	693807686924800005	2016-01-31T14:46:57	Why I love daytraders...there are 4 billion stocks in downtrends but you guys are trying to short FB for pennies. Brilliant.
CallBuyer	692817456767827968	2016-01-28T21:12:08	Big volume rug pull in AMZN after big volume ride up on air. Woof.
CallBuyer	692380083336691712	2016-01-27T16:14:10	Adding AAPL, $94s. Largest holding. Jumbo.
CallBuyer	692073156161474560	2016-01-26T19:54:33	Who is this Yusko clown? Says 75% chance of recession this year.  Irresponsible and biased.
CallBuyer	691278546812190721	2016-01-24T15:17:03	If you've been 'in cash' since December you have probably been 'in cash' since 2009. Cut the nonsense.
CallBuyer	690529241876791296	2016-01-22T13:39:35	Like having some super bears like Mark Yusko in the stream. Makes for fun reading usually.
CallBuyer	690401439693275138	2016-01-22T05:11:44	LongShortTrader 100% honestly did not read his note, but certainly believe in momentum vs price lows. Best way to find 'divergences.'
CallBuyer	690400104067547140	2016-01-22T05:06:26	LongShortTrader Finally caught!
CallBuyer	690399269237460993	2016-01-22T05:03:07	Would like to say yesterday was the low but nearly all momentum lows are retested with a 'price low' that can undercut.
CallBuyer	689866860716756993	2016-01-20T17:47:31	Adding SBUX, $55s...this market is really squeezing the portfolio but quality and value are great. Rough times.
CallBuyer	689659029300318213	2016-01-20T04:01:40	jackstone104 Hope so. 1500s would be generational buy but would hurt badly, even with hedges.
CallBuyer	689658374728859648	2016-01-20T03:59:04	Maybe we can get a -100 SPX tomorrow. 1700s will be nice and we are ready. Current portfolio is getting thrashed but great prices soon.
CallBuyer	688566894325035009	2016-01-17T03:41:55	amirstep They've been conditioned since, literally, forever.
CallBuyer	688566153111846912	2016-01-17T03:38:58	LongShortTrader No major bankruptcies yet is my biggest shock. Don't know how companies like CHK still exist.
CallBuyer	688565592941563904	2016-01-17T03:36:44	amirstep It's all silly. Everyone just wants to have called "the top" so they can sell whatever product they push (newsletter, managed)
CallBuyer	688565155941216256	2016-01-17T03:35:00	LongShortTrader Exactly. This correction has been ongoing since 2014. Can likely extend for longer but plenty of good stocks getting cheap.
CallBuyer	688563550063841280	2016-01-17T03:28:37	Everyone has confirmed bear market and 25%+ correction is here. Noted.
CallBuyer	688008037529980928	2016-01-15T14:41:13	Hell of a TRIN reading there. Put on some minor additions to existing common. Portfolio is blood red. Been getting calls all morning.
CallBuyer	687976805144358912	2016-01-15T12:37:06	Market is looking to retire its participants. Scary action. Expect most stocks to open -5% or more. Go shop? Or cry?
CallBuyer	687659397292535808	2016-01-14T15:35:51	Adding NXPI into this confluence of support. Stop is a weekly close under $72 so extremely tight. Semi sentiment is ridiculous.
CallBuyer	687632276381921280	2016-01-14T13:48:04	AAII bulls lower than 2011 and 2009? Fantastic stat, truly.
CallBuyer	687369502674255873	2016-01-13T20:23:54	Adding SBNY in high $134s. Best in breed. Close enough to $133 target to start adding.
CallBuyer	687360772217933824	2016-01-13T19:49:13	Extremes all around and they've shot everyone including the leaders. Close.
CallBuyer	687359713797877760	2016-01-13T19:45:00	Woof. Want to add but it's too soon.
CallBuyer	687248204455395328	2016-01-13T12:21:55	lalaruza74 Might pay to go opposite of any call he makes into the future. He's awful.
CallBuyer	686637386948804608	2016-01-11T19:54:44	LongShortTrader I just can't believe they would hang their advisors out to dry like that.
CallBuyer	686634385064497153	2016-01-11T19:42:49	JPM, UBS and others stating sell the rips. This is great.
CallBuyer	685451348670836737	2016-01-08T13:21:51	JC Parrot out calling for a drop to 1576 again. Just like last time when he called it ahead of a 250 point rally.
CallBuyer	685248008007643136	2016-01-07T23:53:51	Everyone is calling for AAPL to $80. See why technically, but what's the fundamental thesis for the company to lose $200 BILLION in cap?
CallBuyer	685190689613844483	2016-01-07T20:06:05	irw999 That's fair. Many individual stocks have been in bear markets for 6-12 months. The indices are not.
CallBuyer	685187864464850944	2016-01-07T19:54:51	We added. Let it burn.
CallBuyer	685164612887691265	2016-01-07T18:22:28	Getting killed. This is not the bottom yet. Also not the start of a bear market.
CallBuyer	684926787579686912	2016-01-07T02:37:26	When was the last time EVERYONE knew the bear market was coming and prepared accordingly. Please.
CallBuyer	684758004873453568	2016-01-06T15:26:45	NACMtrader17 The summer was euphoria? No chance man
CallBuyer	684741554104340480	2016-01-06T14:21:23	Guess this is the first bull market to top on panic and depression rather than euphoria. Congrats ZeroHedge!
CallBuyer	684440660187955200	2016-01-05T18:25:44	Although it's apparently headed to $80 on this head and shoulders move. AAPL
CallBuyer	684428670434414592	2016-01-05T17:38:05	Added more AAPL into an already oversized position. Considering adding to DIS
CallBuyer	684024350119428096	2016-01-04T14:51:28	Adding WYNN...low 65s
CallBuyer	683657359156199425	2016-01-03T14:33:10	For our 2016 outlook...absolutely expect a large decline this year, perhaps 20% but could come after run to 2200-2300.
CallBuyer	677538538536194048	2015-12-17T17:19:10	I have to believe that the Fundrise eREIT launch and Zell selling everything is ringing the top for housing. Be cautious.
CallBuyer	677511759679328260	2015-12-17T15:32:45	Actively considering buying APC back at $47 after taking assorted losses and gains at $66 (as posted)
CallBuyer	677476755637161984	2015-12-17T13:13:40	You know you've lived life wrong when everyone is happy you've been arrested. What an asshole.
CallBuyer	676595846557908993	2015-12-15T02:53:15	Hoping for another red open to buy more. This snapback rally will be nice.
CallBuyer	675727321379287040	2015-12-12T17:22:02	We are big buyers on any red on Monday at least for a bounce. Our cue was a follow who is getting giddy bearish just like at every bottom.
CallBuyer	675300031302381568	2015-12-11T13:04:08	Market has been rejected at 2100 over 50 times this year. Can Santa correct that or do we finish red for once? No real buyers out there
CallBuyer	674552770679189504	2015-12-09T11:34:47	LongShortTrader Strange to see that random dude with a gray beard.
CallBuyer	673839483368964096	2015-12-07T12:20:26	Will take 25% loss or so on remaining shares in BLUE today. Terrible all around but we had quite a few rebounds to get fully out and didn't
CallBuyer	670256170276360192	2015-11-27T15:01:38	BLUE. Do we sell at $100 or $500?
CallBuyer	669235382836400128	2015-11-24T19:25:23	Looks like this oil play will pay out nicely if it can continue.
CallBuyer	668453735887187968	2015-11-22T15:39:24	vcutrader Fat finger. Back to 10th place.
CallBuyer	667391247640895488	2015-11-19T17:17:27	IncomeTrader Agreed. What an idiot. Didn't even understand how shorting worked yet put 100% of account into a small cap bio.
CallBuyer	667117688070754308	2015-11-18T23:10:25	@FuturesPlayer Footer was also tweeting like crazy about his service. Times must be getting rough again for those hacks.
CallBuyer	667048706915606528	2015-11-18T18:36:19	lalaruza74 Believe it makes a range between $37ish-55 moving forward...probably for extended time. We are closer to bottom than top.
CallBuyer	666682831830142977	2015-11-17T18:22:28	What to do with BLUE...what to do.
CallBuyer	666592419006308353	2015-11-17T12:23:12	Price looks good to put on oil trade posted yesterday.
CallBuyer	666452397141594113	2015-11-17T03:06:48	Depends on your costs and risk profile but shorting DWTI here with oil near $40 appears to make sense. Capital gains + free decay from 3x
CallBuyer	665615576878968832	2015-11-14T19:41:34	amirstep Any dip is buyable. If following 2011 script, we have some more to go. Ultimate target has always been at least 2250.
CallBuyer	665607492718710785	2015-11-14T19:09:27	amirstep Wouldn't surprise me that you could get 35-85% return on a trade on it, but I'm not sure if the company makes it long-term.
CallBuyer	664858720199909376	2015-11-12T17:34:06	Another 100m volume day in SUNE coming. Nuts.
CallBuyer	664639402140966912	2015-11-12T03:02:36	LongShortTrader Honestly, it could be, especially if it was Einhorn getting out today. Can the company stay solvent long enough to pay us?
CallBuyer	664638688777904128	2015-11-12T02:59:46	Also wonder who was liquidating out of SUNE today? Was it Rishi? Einhorn?
