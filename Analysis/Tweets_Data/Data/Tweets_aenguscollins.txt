aenguscollins	709321000329060353	2016-03-14T10:11:19	georgepearkes Poorly phrased on my part. Meant IP in early 2016 turning out much more robust than was looking likely coming into the year.
aenguscollins	709319244421451781	2016-03-14T10:04:21	Strong euro zone IP numbers this morning. Up 2.1% m-o-m in January. Significantly better than expected.

aenguscollins	709314449371435008	2016-03-14T09:45:17	We've cut our China growth forecast for 2018-20.   Also, we've put up the risk of hard landing from 30% to 40%.

aenguscollins	709148302835634176	2016-03-13T22:45:05	AfD a bit stronger than expected but these are manageable results for Merkel, as we said last week they would be.
