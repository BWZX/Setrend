ebruenig	716738653150650368	2016-04-03T21:26:25	Ahnid I care about campaign finance transparency and would like to know. If you can't prove it, that speaks for itself as well.
ebruenig	716738538361004032	2016-04-03T21:25:58	Ahnid If you can produce proof that JonathanDBrown is paid, or that the people in the footage he posted are, please do so.

ebruenig	716735659214508036	2016-04-03T21:14:32	Ahnid JonathanDBrown It's not libel to fact-check a claim -- go ahead and file a suit. You're free to report me for asking you for proof.
ebruenig	716735501588381702	2016-04-03T21:13:54	Ahnid JonathanDBrown That is perhaps an even more absurd proposition, but hey, if you've got proof, you've got proof.
ebruenig	716735431916797952	2016-04-03T21:13:37	Ahnid JonathanDBrown Are you trying to suggest...that all of the people in the footage are paid actors? Do you have proof of that claim?

ebruenig	716733720426844164	2016-04-03T21:06:49	Ahnid So you're saying, to be clear, you have no proof that JonathanDBrown is being paid $15 per hour by the Sanders campaign.
ebruenig	716733464163262466	2016-04-03T21:05:48	Ahnid Actually, you noted JonathanDBrown is an "outta work actor", specifying the accusation to him, personally.

ebruenig	716732779019550720	2016-04-03T21:03:05	Ahnid No, I don't understand. If you've not got any proof of the accusation you made, retract it.
ebruenig	716732671574020096	2016-04-03T21:02:39	Ahnid You've got screencaps of these death threats I take it, and proof they were sent by Bernie Sanders supporters?
ebruenig	716732478904537092	2016-04-03T21:01:53	.Ahnid Great, so...you've got proof the person you accused of being employed by the Sanders campaign really is, I take it.
ebruenig	716730482784923648	2016-04-03T20:53:57	Ahnid Nah let's do this in public. I'm a journalist, it's what we do. The world deserves to know if this is true. Post what you've got.

ebruenig	709186006982004736	2016-03-14T01:14:54	CosmicBrock One way to respond to that is to tax the rich heavily and redirect some of those funds to improved schools. So double-effect:

ebruenig	709181081375916033	2016-03-14T00:55:20	MichaelMcGough3 Steven_Strauss Additionally, there's taxing the rich heavily (then they'll be less rich).
ebruenig	709180928552275968	2016-03-14T00:54:43	MichaelMcGough3 Steven_Strauss The whites in my city bitched endlessly about our lack of zoning, but it is a goodthing imho.
ebruenig	709180854132740097	2016-03-14T00:54:26	MichaelMcGough3 Steven_Strauss Idk, I met my husband in a public school. So did my parents. Vastly different class backgrounds.
ebruenig	709180412996755456	2016-03-14T00:52:41	ArtistaPena Sure. I like eliminating poverty by funneling poor people money, but both is good.
ebruenig	709180101028683776	2016-03-14T00:51:26	Steven_Strauss One solution to this is to tax the living daylights out of them so it's harder for them to do that. :)
ebruenig	709180022435799040	2016-03-14T00:51:07	Steven_Strauss Likewise rich people leave single payer systems to seek boutique healthcare in other countries at times.
ebruenig	709179886401929216	2016-03-14T00:50:35	Steven_Strauss Like I said, it's not always successful -- rich people come up with ways to escape ever interacting with poors as people.
ebruenig	709179581215989764	2016-03-14T00:49:22	ArtistaPena I advocate a universal child benefit, which would mean more money to all parents.

ebruenig	709179102574604288	2016-03-14T00:47:28	ArtistaPena Give their parents more money.
ebruenig	709178800244965377	2016-03-14T00:46:16	lethomas1294 Agreed. My parents were well off. My husband's dad drove a forklift for a living. We met in a public high school.

ebruenig	709178035971497984	2016-03-14T00:43:14	Steven_Strauss I went to public schools.
ebruenig	709177895399378944	2016-03-14T00:42:40	ebruenig Not that it's always successful. But ideally, universals put the richer and poorer on the same raft together. Which is good.
ebruenig	709177743112593412	2016-03-14T00:42:04	ebruenig This is one of those classic virtues of universal programs: they marry the interests of the well-to-do and poor together.

ebruenig	708479551706439680	2016-03-12T02:27:42	nberlat Universal programs aren't a trick. They're just universal. Like social security. Like public schools. No one is being tricked.
ebruenig	708479219924410369	2016-03-12T02:26:23	nberlat The alt here is HRC, who literally called poor moms on welfare "deadbeats" without "dignity", so I'll take Bernie any day.
ebruenig	708479108125171712	2016-03-12T02:25:56	nberlat Again I think he has the best policy plan for poverty in America, but he doesn't have to sell it that way.
ebruenig	708478549813022720	2016-03-12T02:23:43	nberlat Ok, that is also fine, it does not require bernie sanders to misrepresent universal programs as specifically poor-targeted.
ebruenig	708477736235483137	2016-03-12T02:20:29	nberlat Fab, so we'll do the stigma dance after the universal program dance. It is settled.
ebruenig	708477116657041410	2016-03-12T02:18:02	nberlat Do you imagine this problem would be remotely improved by having means-tested public school only?
ebruenig	708476767217061889	2016-03-12T02:16:38	nberlat Idk, they haven't so far. We have universal public education, for instance.
ebruenig	708476349699264512	2016-03-12T02:14:59	nberlat This is literally the point of a universal program. Everyone has access.
ebruenig	708475665641771008	2016-03-12T02:12:16	nberlat Even if this means, somehow, you lose an opportunity to 'reduce the stigma of poverty,' not that anti-pov programs have done that.
ebruenig	708475531868643328	2016-03-12T02:11:44	girlziplocked Sure
ebruenig	708475449731588099	2016-03-12T02:11:24	nberlat What I'm saying is if designing/marketing programs as poor-specific hurts their chances, it's better not to do that.
ebruenig	708475091894595585	2016-03-12T02:09:59	nberlat Ha, but socialism is even less specific to the poor...
ebruenig	708474807386562561	2016-03-12T02:08:51	nberlat I would rather have the universal programs go through than fall on my sword over stigma, but I'm a materialist myself.
ebruenig	708474659537358848	2016-03-12T02:08:16	nberlat And higher incomes mean heightened ability to pay rent.
ebruenig	708474562531475456	2016-03-12T02:07:53	nberlat If someone is willing to pay rent, surely private developers will build the housing. And Bernie proposes increasing incomes...
ebruenig	708473937437597696	2016-03-12T02:05:24	nberlat I'm not sure what you can do on the federal level to force more housing -- it's not federally relevant. It's a local problem.
ebruenig	708473375086276608	2016-03-12T02:03:10	nberlat Housing is a cost like any other cost, and Bernie is proposing providing more money to several of the poorest populations.
ebruenig	708473300473790464	2016-03-12T02:02:52	nberlat I mean if people have more money they can pay more costs. SSDI, SS, min wage go up, then poor populations have more money.
ebruenig	708472513232293889	2016-03-12T01:59:44	nberlat As you can see, he considers it to be a part of a broader issue. He hasn't spent a lot of time making it granular, because it's not
ebruenig	708471997366460417	2016-03-12T01:57:41	nberlat Yeah, he's remarked on housing costs. 
ebruenig	708471541307187201	2016-03-12T01:55:52	nberlat He says he wants to expand SSDI; also, elderly are often not-working and poor. 
ebruenig	708471113517559808	2016-03-12T01:54:10	nberlat He talks about increasing social security, he also talks about FMLA (so caretakers.) He talks about jobs programs.
ebruenig	708470771530731520	2016-03-12T01:52:49	nberlat You don't think single payer healthcare would help poor people? $15 minimum wage?
ebruenig	708470577946894336	2016-03-12T01:52:03	nberlat And poors, because of money in politics, have difficulties advocating for their interests that the rich do not.
ebruenig	708470416428371968	2016-03-12T01:51:24	nberlat There's a wisdom in not saying, "univ healthcare/higher ed will benefit the very poor." People don't vote for programs for poors.
ebruenig	708470249851588608	2016-03-12T01:50:44	nberlat One of the benefits of universal programs is that they dont single poor out, creating politically vulnerable means-tested programs.

ebruenig	701778239010660352	2016-02-22T14:39:05	librarythingtim It's happening now in USA -- a lot of people are just more free about admitting they never really believed.

ebruenig	701776266660179968	2016-02-22T14:31:15	librarythingtim I'm personally okay with giving a lot of that up, but I think it presents a serious challenge for social democracy in USA.

ebruenig	701775960043950080	2016-02-22T14:30:01	librarythingtim In all seriousness, what the American is zeroing in on is a lack of class division in parenting. That will produce some
