BuucketHe4d	713739665740849154	2016-03-26T14:49:31	24Kt_Steve bingo. All politics are economic, most economics are political.
BuucketHe4d	713739446668144640	2016-03-26T14:48:39	24Kt_Steve agreed. With socio-economic collapse and abolition of gov, there would be a series of smaller skirmishes but world wide
BuucketHe4d	713738715131195393	2016-03-26T14:45:44	24Kt_Steve pol/ec are different. But the same. (Have many similarities and much overlap)

BuucketHe4d	713737988434305024	2016-03-26T14:42:51	BuucketHe4d 
BuucketHe4d	713737647831822336	2016-03-26T14:41:30	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich absolutely. Anarchy will not abolish this. It is part of the human condition.
BuucketHe4d	713737440188563457	2016-03-26T14:40:40	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich "if everyone agreed with me, how lovely that would be" ~ buckethead circa 2016
BuucketHe4d	713737141474426881	2016-03-26T14:39:29	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich we agree here except this: your stance says systems drive humanity. I say humanity drives systems.
BuucketHe4d	713736632315326465	2016-03-26T14:37:28	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich full disclosure: I think AnCap would outlast ancom because tyranny sets in faster w communism.
BuucketHe4d	713736226306727936	2016-03-26T14:35:51	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich absolutely, and I admire both AnCap and ancom philosophies. It's just the pesky reality thing that ruins them.
BuucketHe4d	713735440952479745	2016-03-26T14:32:44	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich that's simplistic, but fair enough. Anarchy will result in new governance.  Not utopia. :-)
BuucketHe4d	713734448303448066	2016-03-26T14:28:47	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich but I hold no illusions that it means the end of the human condition
BuucketHe4d	713734235560022016	2016-03-26T14:27:56	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich political alliances form, coercion ensues. I'm a believer in cycles, and welcome some olde tyme anarchye
BuucketHe4d	713733756360790017	2016-03-26T14:26:02	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich this tendency to accumulate power, advantage, wealth will not be eliminated within anarchy.
BuucketHe4d	713733532019998720	2016-03-26T14:25:09	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich I'd argue that private companies use government to stifle competition, creat monopolies. &gt;&gt;&gt;
BuucketHe4d	713733013746630656	2016-03-26T14:23:05	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich ME TOO. ITS WORKING!
BuucketHe4d	713732867369598977	2016-03-26T14:22:30	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich so in ancapistan, rape doesn't exist? (Literally or as a metaphor for commerce)
BuucketHe4d	713732554961108992	2016-03-26T14:21:16	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich you have that very same alternative now.
BuucketHe4d	713732295128129536	2016-03-26T14:20:14	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich this strikes as a mildly idealistic view of commerce. :-)
BuucketHe4d	713732009999384576	2016-03-26T14:19:06	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich my point is thus. "Economics is about human interaction." (And so is politics) They are virtually the same beast.
BuucketHe4d	713731625079668739	2016-03-26T14:17:34	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich businesses? As in groups of ppl working toward a common goal?
BuucketHe4d	713731321189834752	2016-03-26T14:16:22	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich or... Get robbed by someone willing to use force, and you're out.
BuucketHe4d	713731154994716672	2016-03-26T14:15:42	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich which is to say, communists will need to be killed. You'll need sufficient might (use of force) to maintain
BuucketHe4d	713730624738238464	2016-03-26T14:13:36	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich private property is defended by force. (Unless you believe humanity becomes universally altruistic in ancapistan)
BuucketHe4d	713730376066269186	2016-03-26T14:12:36	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich whether political or economic, there is one natural law: might makes right. Always maintained by force.
BuucketHe4d	713729708446363648	2016-03-26T14:09:57	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich the same is true of economic and political activity. Only the means of garnering advantage differ.
BuucketHe4d	713727994133659649	2016-03-26T14:03:08	24Kt_Steve KevinKimmich life is coercion. If I'm the only human, I'm still coerced to find food. Chewing is labor.
