joshu	721786319035207680	2016-04-17T19:44:03	qhardy did you see the autonomous event i am trying to run?
joshu	721786204971077632	2016-04-17T19:43:36	odomojuli gcode. they are cnc machines.
joshu	721722463315308548	2016-04-17T15:30:18	More plottertwitter 
joshu	721722018412961794	2016-04-17T15:28:32	I didn't even know plottertwitter  was a thing. 
joshu	721720450531786752	2016-04-17T15:22:18	qhardy i am hoping this trend continues all the way up to entire  vehicles
joshu	721719634689286144	2016-04-17T15:19:04	inconvergent now you're talkin'!
joshu	721597740774334464	2016-04-17T07:14:42	Stupid othermachine tricks: 
joshu	721545792566140932	2016-04-17T03:48:17	waxpancake this will be very addictive once i stop getting killed due to lag
joshu	721531128004280320	2016-04-17T02:50:00	i hate you, waxpancake slitherio
joshu	721504226883477504	2016-04-17T01:03:07	danshapiro heh. I want something to modulate the water with the urea resin
joshu	721496793578491905	2016-04-17T00:33:35	danshapiro I don't see it
joshu	721481983117754368	2016-04-16T23:34:43	mjdominus ok i am way off, then. back to the grindstone
joshu	721480479602388992	2016-04-16T23:28:45	BradJMurray ok then i am way off
joshu	721480436438818816	2016-04-16T23:28:35	bertmb ok, so i am not even close.
joshu	721476348854689792	2016-04-16T23:12:20	how many strange robots do i have to build before i am officially a mad scientist?
joshu	721468547898019840	2016-04-16T22:41:20	merket just a tiny bit. i hope MountainViewPD isn't reading this.
joshu	721467870572457984	2016-04-16T22:38:39	merket i need to slightly drift a car.
joshu	721467113857134592	2016-04-16T22:35:38	any ideas where i can rent a large empty parking lot for an hour near mountain view?
joshu	721463090680705024	2016-04-16T22:19:39	danshapiro gefilte fish is just an excuse for eating horseradish. so make horseradish jelly?
joshu	721462627298201600	2016-04-16T22:17:49	mrgunn SimoneGiertz building really strange, high risk stuff. most startups are very pedestrian/conservative
joshu	721459855538524160	2016-04-16T22:06:48	mrgunn SimoneGiertz also i hate the current trend of creativity to get a single step into terra infirma, plant a flag, and do a startup
joshu	721459643424215041	2016-04-16T22:05:57	mattocko you should write slash fic
joshu	721457200724488192	2016-04-16T21:56:15	mrgunn SimoneGiertz i also used the time to learn a proper cad tool. i knew about syringe pumps...
joshu	721454552780648448	2016-04-16T21:45:44	mrgunn SimoneGiertz also, i've sold a personal hobby to a public company in the past. so that's actually an inane thing to say.
joshu	721452155731705856	2016-04-16T21:36:12	Urea resin + xantham fun test. Cc danshapiro 
joshu	721451873136345088	2016-04-16T21:35:05	mrgunn SimoneGiertz learning how to make things increases value of future time. I regret nothing.
joshu	721449071064403968	2016-04-16T21:23:57	danshapiro I am raising my molecular gastronomy stuff already. 
joshu	721448530687107073	2016-04-16T21:21:48	mrgunn SimoneGiertz a) mine cost like $15, b) syringe pump was wrong anyway, needed peristaltic pump. 
joshu	721429669489152000	2016-04-16T20:06:51	Previous gen syringe pump (for SimoneGiertz ) 
joshu	721429162905370626	2016-04-16T20:04:50	SimoneGiertz i built a couple of these for liquids recently. this one worked:  (for thin liquids anyway)
joshu	721410510860603393	2016-04-16T18:50:43	danshapiro because I am going to be demoing this near kids I am going to with something pretty safe
joshu	721409538889424896	2016-04-16T18:46:51	danshapiro next project is probably a piece of wood I can level...
joshu	721409420496732160	2016-04-16T18:46:23	danshapiro that is an interesting idea. Will consider after I test my new batch of materials.
joshu	721409256172290048	2016-04-16T18:45:44	danshapiro already ahead of you. I have that stuff on-hand already.
joshu	721407403908947968	2016-04-16T18:38:22	AlexRoy144 they see it as a point of differentiation, even. A feature.
joshu	721225861056180226	2016-04-16T06:36:59	NotDuncanSmith is there a url?
joshu	721172946543226880	2016-04-16T03:06:43	flipzagging I am up to my neck in the current one
joshu	721171645738516481	2016-04-16T03:01:33	pkedrosky I mean, consider the TAM slide
joshu	721171599093661696	2016-04-16T03:01:22	torrez 
joshu	721170917359898624	2016-04-16T02:58:40	pkedrosky world domination is the implicit bullet point in every business plan.
joshu	721170471908020224	2016-04-16T02:56:53	pkedrosky that sounds more like a business model. I prefer crazier ideas.
joshu	721169682665852928	2016-04-16T02:53:45	Need more crazy robot ideas.
joshu	721135840861093888	2016-04-16T00:39:17	benhuh you should come to the track.
joshu	721133082200264704	2016-04-16T00:28:19	johnolilly I am surprised how well it works. I mostly focused on the mechanicals. Software is next.
joshu	721131855655768064	2016-04-16T00:23:27	first car test with my automotive camera prototype:  (muhahaha it works)
joshu	721016111852965888	2016-04-15T16:43:31	crystaldbeasley this times one million billion trillion.
joshu	721015387932925953	2016-04-15T16:40:38	Pinboard I hope there is a monthly subscription required.
joshu	720828013919600640	2016-04-15T04:16:05	abatalion semil I actually think this is a dead evolutionary path. One thing to talk to that can negotiate multiple services.
joshu	720827906256011264	2016-04-15T04:15:39	abatalion semil chatlets?
joshu	720760267815002113	2016-04-14T23:46:53	kimbatronic geteero i am very happy so far
joshu	720715197619408896	2016-04-14T20:47:48	i need to make a small platform that i can make very level for my plotter. is there a name for this or the parts i to use, so i can google?
joshu	720496508991315969	2016-04-14T06:18:48	mattocko too bad you didn't already go to quantum crypto.
joshu	720496434995445760	2016-04-14T06:18:30	I think we're at 12 teams now. Getting full! 
joshu	720490862740905984	2016-04-14T05:56:22	mattocko i already have it. ps your 2048bit keys are too short
joshu	720440853160787969	2016-04-14T02:37:39	cshirky are we talking hot grits?
joshu	720401124411310080	2016-04-13T23:59:47	Just did a radio show with robconeybeer 
joshu	720390628958298112	2016-04-13T23:18:04	AAinslie email, I guess?
joshu	720377548761268224	2016-04-13T22:26:06	sircoolio robconeybeer has a show on Sirius XM
joshu	720377427843649536	2016-04-13T22:25:37	AAinslie this alanwilz sounds like my kind of crazy. Intro?
joshu	720374196170133508	2016-04-13T22:12:46	Heading up SF to prep for robconeybeer's radio show at 4:30. Should I ask for questions via Twitter?
joshu	720373076882366464	2016-04-13T22:08:20	BenedictEvans well, dynamite
joshu	720372933432987649	2016-04-13T22:07:45	johnolilly fund the founders to buy it back from Dropbox?
joshu	720372653630947332	2016-04-13T22:06:39	AAinslie alanwilz I do like British cars...
joshu	720358253524230146	2016-04-13T21:09:25	Pinboard I back up all my quanta and qualia on a regular basis. I just email them to myself on gmail.
joshu	720357228222414848	2016-04-13T21:05:21	SmoothOn willsmith I think I confused your tech support desk.
joshu	720350943024295936	2016-04-13T20:40:22	inconvergent i do feel like i make more stuff but only because my day "job" is even less productive per se
joshu	720350844932100096	2016-04-13T20:39:59	inconvergent i go from hating what i made to how it works to how little progress i have made. it's what drives you.
joshu	720350761004060674	2016-04-13T20:39:39	inconvergent that sounds about right. any maker that doesn't hate something about what they are doing isn't worth their salt
joshu	720350634935869441	2016-04-13T20:39:09	inconvergent your stuff reminds me a lot of 
joshu	720350368983416834	2016-04-13T20:38:06	inconvergent also, damnit, my pinboard tells me that i bookmarked your stuff in 2015. 
joshu	720349847740493825	2016-04-13T20:36:01	inconvergent btw your level of productivity is daunting. wow
joshu	720349277331959810	2016-04-13T20:33:45	inconvergent not my place to argue. was just making sure you knew about the relevant things i've seen
joshu	720347389635080194	2016-04-13T20:26:15	inconvergent i am assuming you know about concorde etc too? super useful
joshu	720347278595137536	2016-04-13T20:25:49	inconvergent some other things I have used: 
joshu	720347171229270016	2016-04-13T20:25:23	inconvergent i was thinking about using an r*tree. seen libspatialindex?
joshu	720346638170984448	2016-04-13T20:23:16	inconvergent fuck me,  would have come in useful yesterday.
joshu	720346481715089408	2016-04-13T20:22:39	inconvergent anodized aluminum with a CNC pocket cut looks good too though
joshu	720346357630771201	2016-04-13T20:22:09	inconvergent i already put that on my todo list to try. just have to convert to gcode, which shouldn't be hard
joshu	720341171336163329	2016-04-13T20:01:33	inconvergent also i can make huge plots of this stuff on the whiteboard. could get nice paper and fancy pens too
joshu	720341090134417408	2016-04-13T20:01:13	inconvergent have you thought about cncing alu sheets for the simpler patterns?
joshu	720340586016813058	2016-04-13T19:59:13	inconvergent these are amazing. expensive?
joshu	720335595931734017	2016-04-13T19:39:23	SmoothOn willsmith danshapiro I created a ticket - DMA-DZ2-MSVY - i would love to collaborate.
joshu	720331116649971712	2016-04-13T19:21:35	was hoping to get tinysubversions to come to my robot racecar event but apparently I misunderstood the whole "bot" thing
joshu	720330893068374016	2016-04-13T19:20:42	I'm going to be on Launch Pad today on XM Radio today at 4:30 Pacific, 7:30 PM Eastern. 
joshu	720327857143021568	2016-04-13T19:08:38	willsmith I fixed it so you could do that.
joshu	720316779868737536	2016-04-13T18:24:37	willsmith danshapiro come see it? I am on the peninsula.
joshu	720316667813691392	2016-04-13T18:24:11	willsmith danshapiro oh man have I ever. This machine is pretty flimsy. I have built more substantial machines. 
joshu	720307672063414272	2016-04-13T17:48:26

joshu	720144289641041920	2016-04-13T06:59:12	dannysullivan wish they'd credit or work with JustGetFlux
joshu	720126679306346496	2016-04-13T05:49:14	danshapiro willsmith good thing i got 
joshu	720107364632903680	2016-04-13T04:32:29	willsmith danshapiro so far lots of messy pics of the results in 
joshu	720103570461339649	2016-04-13T04:17:24	danshapiro willsmith oh my god I am doing artisanal inkjet printing then.
joshu	720076041092333568	2016-04-13T02:28:01	nmoryl yeah I will figure out how to do guests. I don't know yet if we will have room for drivers or will have to charge for that tho
joshu	720052528725958656	2016-04-13T00:54:35	I'm excited about this one! 
joshu	720036825205616641	2016-04-12T23:52:11	annimaniac ManuKumar following up on my earlier email
joshu	720005742317608960	2016-04-12T21:48:40	ManuKumar ohhhh
joshu	720004882686566400	2016-04-12T21:45:15	ManuKumar are you saying I should take you to lunch
joshu	720002353449930753	2016-04-12T21:35:12	ManuKumar but I want to pick your brain
joshu	720001862078898177	2016-04-12T21:33:15	ManuKumar that actually reminds me, want to get coffee?
joshu	720001084979195905	2016-04-12T21:30:10	ManuKumar I do a first one free for the brain scavenging with bigger companies that have interesting problems...
joshu	720000928313507840	2016-04-12T21:29:32	ManuKumar damn. 
joshu	720000436221059073	2016-04-12T21:27:35	ManuKumar sounds great. Let's get coffee and I can pick your brain.
joshu	720000295963533312	2016-04-12T21:27:02	davidhornik ironically my flying solar wing has terrible network connectivity
joshu	720000007181479937	2016-04-12T21:25:53	semil rsarver something something global address book
joshu	719999891003445248	2016-04-12T21:25:25	ManuKumar I noticed you invested in &lt;three unrelated companies&gt; and thought you might be interested in...
joshu	719999721176084480	2016-04-12T21:24:45	mendel I use index cards. Less scary and more fun to throw out
joshu	719960231724199937	2016-04-12T18:47:50	metacool can you join us?
joshu	719769196196864000	2016-04-12T06:08:43	I talked with joshu about his upcoming autonomous track day. Some interesting thinking about the project 
joshu	719729944008400896	2016-04-12T03:32:45	ataussig geteero fast before and after. but the old system was having weird network lag (dropout on video etc)
joshu	719715680841371648	2016-04-12T02:36:04	seldo what'd you do now
joshu	719715336077979648	2016-04-12T02:34:42	just transitioned my whole house to geteero while my wife was away
joshu	719668815659798529	2016-04-11T23:29:51	mozboz katylevinson yes. i posted something and an instant expert lectured me for five paragraphs about stuff they'd just googled.
joshu	719668669052100610	2016-04-11T23:29:16	mozboz katylevinson fair enough. I mean "people employed as software engineers"
joshu	719645076922568704	2016-04-11T21:55:31	Thanks for explaining sanctioning bodies to me.
joshu	719644641713192960	2016-04-11T21:53:47	It is amazing how condescending it is when engineers used to just googling to become instant experts apply it to everything else.
joshu	719420700964958208	2016-04-11T07:03:55	inconvergent i was planning to actually work backwards from an image i think
joshu	719418358387515392	2016-04-11T06:54:37	inconvergent this one.
joshu	719417933051535360	2016-04-11T06:52:56	inconvergent i got the idea from watching one of your gifs
joshu	719417742483279872	2016-04-11T06:52:10	inconvergent anyway. i think there's a special case for RD pictures. each blob becomes a drop, and  a large one becomes a bunch of drips
joshu	719417345257517056	2016-04-11T06:50:35	inconvergent there is also stipplegen using secord's voronoi relaxation: 
joshu	719416005605208064	2016-04-11T06:45:16	inconvergent i reimplemented this one 
joshu	719415958180265984	2016-04-11T06:45:05	inconvergent yeah
joshu	719415774243213312	2016-04-11T06:44:21	inconvergent good paper though. and omg they have code
joshu	719415265759354881	2016-04-11T06:42:20	inconvergent i built something based on Bridson's sampling algorithm that seems to work well enough.
joshu	719415105918672896	2016-04-11T06:41:41	inconvergent yes. i think for the RD type stuff it's perfect, though
joshu	719411747828793345	2016-04-11T06:28:21	inconvergent thanks. Next is finding the way to deposit dots so that they look good.  This one looked like a puddle 
joshu	719347312879775748	2016-04-11T02:12:18	mcgd or does soap melt? hmm
joshu	719347279367249920	2016-04-11T02:12:10	mcgd can you get me some bulk soap? flat slabs would be good
joshu	719347195103674368	2016-04-11T02:11:50	seven groups confirmed for the selfracingcars days, including two whole vehicle teams. woot
joshu	719346959572557824	2016-04-11T02:10:54	chr1sa of course i saw it in the picture after i tweeted this.
joshu	719346747210731521	2016-04-11T02:10:04	mcgd i wonder what happens when i put soap in the CNC machine
joshu	719343479143333888	2016-04-11T01:57:04	chr1sa what hw are you using?
joshu	719286839597608960	2016-04-10T22:12:00	mflux also I notice great engineers always hate something. If not your code, your design. If not that, your tools. Etc
joshu	719286600505516032	2016-04-10T22:11:03	mflux I guess the motivation is important. Are you doing speculative research? If yes, then ok to trade technical debt for existential risk
joshu	719286256060932097	2016-04-10T22:09:41	nelson cc elatable
joshu	719285588587728896	2016-04-10T22:07:02	mflux every single time. i take it to mean "i am excited about arriving" rather than "i am bored of this"
joshu	719284906845560832	2016-04-10T22:04:20	inconvergent also reminds me a bit of some old tinkering i did. 
joshu	719284778080415745	2016-04-10T22:03:49	inconvergent so far i only have dots working though: 
joshu	719284461288820736	2016-04-10T22:02:33	inconvergent this series is really inspiring me. i'm trying to design a physical plotter to place droplets in the same way you are.
joshu	719276038954442752	2016-04-10T21:29:05	Joshmedia 
joshu	719275589471842304	2016-04-10T21:27:18	Joshmedia I got that one too.
joshu	719275481313378304	2016-04-10T21:26:52	LadyCartoonist I just think meant some things to try. There is no clear answer but there are several axes
joshu	719217940155883520	2016-04-10T17:38:14	joeracer I am not making spheres. I am depositing ink. I just want to retain the 3D shape
joshu	719031875793063936	2016-04-10T05:18:52	Case no it is water dropped onto resin powder.
joshu	719025497485619201	2016-04-10T04:53:32	Another attempt. I need to rig up something so I can move the needle closer. 
joshu	719020843196493825	2016-04-10T04:35:02	I think this is gonna either come out derp or amazing. 
joshu	719020700191707136	2016-04-10T04:34:28	danshapiro very nice. Will think about how to do that.
joshu	719015998364327936	2016-04-10T04:15:47	BG_Nelson epoxy? The stuff o have is too thick
joshu	718961833281912833	2016-04-10T00:40:33	LadyCartoonist can you pick out some stuff on amazon for me to order and try out? that seems easiest.
joshu	718942930828861440	2016-04-09T23:25:26	mengwong probably no. i'm using aquarium air hose
joshu	718942876831338497	2016-04-09T23:25:13	i wonder what would happen if i drip water onto a layer of powdered glue or something
joshu	718942718295060480	2016-04-09T23:24:36	rohit_x_ so i can run it through the tubing succesfully and then cure it when it drips on? i guess i can just remove the tubing apparatus
joshu	718941453817229312	2016-04-09T23:19:34	every time i go to the hardware store or art store, they say, "oh god, what strange thing are you building now?"
joshu	718941157611294721	2016-04-09T23:18:23	neilphillips i just want to attach droplets to a piece of paper. they don't have to be round. just bulbous.
joshu	718941051046612993	2016-04-09T23:17:58	chr1sa i want it to stick to the paper. so the timing isn't that critical. i wonder if my clear tubing transmits UV too?
joshu	718939455751454721	2016-04-09T23:11:38	TheFoodLab yes, except the pattern matters. doesn't have to be food (that was rstephens intuitive leap)
joshu	718939331155496960	2016-04-09T23:11:08	chr1sa i'm trying to deposit in an interesting pattern, like a plotter. i don't want to make individual sphere things.
joshu	718924315194863616	2016-04-09T22:11:28	kfury i have some but it's not very thin
joshu	718920380300136448	2016-04-09T21:55:50	BradJMurray that's not what i am making.
joshu	718920351883788288	2016-04-09T21:55:43	neilphillips i know about those. it's not what i want
joshu	718910818864070656	2016-04-09T21:17:50	dbeyer123 i will totally use green if i get a good answer re things that won't damage the tubing etc
joshu	718910660512337920	2016-04-09T21:17:12	rstephens that's still w/ humans
joshu	718910124203450368	2016-04-09T21:15:04	rstephens btw did you see 
joshu	718910068008177664	2016-04-09T21:14:51	rstephens TheFoodLab i'm definitely a huge fan of thefoodlab. are you into cars by any chance?
joshu	718909626578640896	2016-04-09T21:13:06	TheFoodLab rstephens here's the machine itself. in this case i am using old coffee. 
joshu	718909360735264768	2016-04-09T21:12:02	TheFoodLab rstephens hmm. i do have a variety of molecular gastronomy supplies here. maybe i can drop water into a bed of agar?
joshu	718909057940099072	2016-04-09T21:10:50	TheFoodLab i would like them to stick to the paper. think of it as a glue plotter? (ps omg it's you! i'm not worthy!)
joshu	718908879032029184	2016-04-09T21:10:08	rstephens nope. epoxy or glue or resin or something?
joshu	718908201345818624	2016-04-09T21:07:26	is there a thin liquid that i could drop out of a syringe that will harden as it falls? i want these to solidify. 
joshu	718663389417869313	2016-04-09T04:54:38	Jacob__Gordon but seriously, "i'm going to throw some tires on the track partway through the race" seems awesome
joshu	718656068629344257	2016-04-09T04:25:33	inconvergent lhl i wonder if i can print this on the inkdrop printer. the merged dots etc?
joshu	718655746791964673	2016-04-09T04:24:16	Jacob__Gordon comma_ai that would be awesome. usually those are other cars. but someday soon, yeah!

joshu	718594724806795264	2016-04-09T00:21:47	carlmalamud I think I am in for an extended bout of cat herding. But hopefully.
joshu	718579527450906624	2016-04-08T23:21:24	chr1sa carlbass and the testing event idea was based around you.
joshu	718579385276588032	2016-04-08T23:20:50	chr1sa carlbass I think you can safely take more credit here. You were the first person i talked to about this.
joshu	718578986440220672	2016-04-08T23:19:15	I'll be right there at the starting line w/carlbass. Our autonomous electric gokart is fast &amp; SO crash-tested. Ouch 
joshu	718578828675645440	2016-04-08T23:18:37	LadyCartoonist maybe i should just lend you the machine or make another
joshu	718578441252016128	2016-04-08T23:17:05	LadyCartoonist gotcha. do i just go to the art store and ask? alternatively i will bring the machine to Maker Faire, if you will be there
joshu	718578050900725760	2016-04-08T23:15:32	Steven_McKie comma_ai this can be arrange. george should own a racing suit anyway

joshu	718360309572976640	2016-04-08T08:50:18	LadyCartoonist no, I judged some stuff I got at the art store. No idea what I am doing here, advice welcome.

joshu	718314889077526528	2016-04-08T05:49:49	jeffiel that's true. i was just thinking of the stuff i had on hand will stain practically anything (transtint)
