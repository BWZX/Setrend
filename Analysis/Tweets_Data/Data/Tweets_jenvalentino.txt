jenvalentino	687425922266492929	2016-01-14T00:08:06	KimZetter jeremiahg True. Also, gov incentive is to basically say "let 'em sue." Most requesters don't have $$ to do so.
jenvalentino	687425554568581120	2016-01-14T00:06:38	jeremiahg The requester can sue, but a win for them means documents are disclosed, not that any official is actually punished.
jenvalentino	687423752989204480	2016-01-13T23:59:29	jeremiahg Fair, but something seems broken in the law and/or system if people are allowed to do that so much.
