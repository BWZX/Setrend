MichaelKitces	725349904286142464	2016-04-27T15:44:28	ZTracer Real LTC insurance should actually have a LOWER probability of a claim (but also be cheaper in the process).
MichaelKitces	725349826330779648	2016-04-27T15:44:09	ZTracer Biggest issue is deductibles so small, it's more like pre-paying LTC than buying 'real' insurance. See 
MichaelKitces	725349650518138881	2016-04-27T15:43:27	ZTracer A few thousand a year for premiums, a few hundred thousand in potential claims. Insurance 'leverage' is still there.
MichaelKitces	725349477847060480	2016-04-27T15:42:46	ZTracer I don't love the elimination of the waiver of premium rider either. But I do conceptually understand why it was an issue.
MichaelKitces	725349294291718144	2016-04-27T15:42:02	ZTracer With waiver of premium, nursing home claims end out subsidizing the waiver rider cost for home care claimants?
MichaelKitces	725349157666459648	2016-04-27T15:41:30	ZTracer Was easier to offer waiver of premium for nursing home insurance, b/c claims were usually for 100% of benefit amount from day 1.
MichaelKitces	725349057644892161	2016-04-27T15:41:06	ZTracer You could go on claim and get 1/10th of your benefit for small amount of home care, but waive 100% of your premiums?
MichaelKitces	725348922005295104	2016-04-27T15:40:33	ZTracer My gut is that it isn't about lapse rate assumptions. It's about the awkward challenge of long-term small claims.
MichaelKitces	725348552487088128	2016-04-27T15:39:05	ZTracer It's A drawback I suppose. But if you're claiming $200/day I'm not sure paying premiums equal to $10/day is a deal-killer?

MichaelKitces	721706142401961984	2016-04-17T14:25:27	ronlieber And TurboTax was "nice" enough to charge me 2 more state e-filing fees along with it. $45 software, $350(!) in state fees.
MichaelKitces	721705824125644800	2016-04-17T14:24:11	ronlieber Hrm, just further proving bogus TurboTax state e-file limits, managed to fool the software to process state e-file in 2 batches.

MichaelKitces	721703048180023297	2016-04-17T14:13:09	djbellefy The turbotax software willingly sold me 5 states and after the fact declared they would only e-file 3. Undisclosed
MichaelKitces	721702923286245376	2016-04-17T14:12:40	djbellefy It's not a supply/demand imbalance. It's that turbotax sells you modules up front, and only discloses at the END its limits.
MichaelKitces	721702803811483649	2016-04-17T14:12:11	ronlieber At this point, just trying to decide if I'll merely dispute TurboTax charges via credit card, or file w/ FTC too.
MichaelKitces	721702665240059904	2016-04-17T14:11:38	ronlieber When I was forced to buy each additional state, one at a time, nothing indicated "you will pay ANOTHER 50% to e-file these".
MichaelKitces	721702536147808256	2016-04-17T14:11:07	ronlieber I have no idea. They had no problem charging me $75 to e-file the first 3 states. Which is another $75 they failed to disclose.
MichaelKitces	721702450609201152	2016-04-17T14:10:47	djbellefy Not merely complaining about surge pricing. I'm talking about paying TurboTax for online state modules they refuse to e-file.
MichaelKitces	721702279573827584	2016-04-17T14:10:06	ronlieber Yet TurboTax had NO problem SELLING me all the state modules, for full price, with ZERO warning I won't be able to e-file them.
MichaelKitces	721702165316792320	2016-04-17T14:09:39	ronlieber It has nothing to do with the day I'm filing. Their software is DESIGNED to prevent you from e-filing more than 3 states.
MichaelKitces	721702064011800576	2016-04-17T14:09:15	ronlieber Correct, literally will not e-file. Charged me to buy the software for 5 states, and at LAST SCREEN says "we will only e-file 3".
MichaelKitces	721700931453194240	2016-04-17T14:04:45	23aloha You're "lucky" - turbotax won't even LET ME pay the e-file fees for the state modules THEY SOLD ME!? Such TeamTurboTax fail.

MichaelKitces	720787048089665536	2016-04-15T01:33:18	JohnCircleBlack As more advisors are pressured to publish performance track records, becomes more of an issue?
MichaelKitces	720786867696889857	2016-04-15T01:32:35	JohnCircleBlack Understood from tracking perspective for household, but still issues for advisors who do GIPS track record on mgd accts.
MichaelKitces	720786667515297792	2016-04-15T01:31:47	JohnCircleBlack Billing outside fees into managed accounts will show up as debit to GIPS track record - most software can't separate fee?
MichaelKitces	720786252350550016	2016-04-15T01:30:08	JohnCircleBlack Yes but all under advisors consolidated management. Limits cross-account household performance distortion.
MichaelKitces	720785314504142849	2016-04-15T01:26:25	JohnCircleBlack Yes, but direct billing doesn't scale well right now. And billing other managed accounts can badly distort performance.
MichaelKitces	720784141541863424	2016-04-15T01:21:45	JohnCircleBlack My pleasure. You frame an interesting point. Though I fear challenges of billing such arrangements may still limit?

MichaelKitces	720326690962939905	2016-04-13T19:04:00	ryanWneal Otherwise it's just a private surveillance data trove that the gov't doesn't "own"... they just access when they want/need to?
MichaelKitces	720326570158735360	2016-04-13T19:03:32	ryanWneal Yes but as we've seen in the Apple iPhone case, that line only works when private companies encrypt &amp; protect. Not FB here?

MichaelKitces	720326411643432961	2016-04-13T19:02:54	ryanWneal Yes but the sheer volume of Facebook can identify "John Doe #35274" across a wide range of videos for gov't to use/track.

MichaelKitces	720325354385252352	2016-04-13T18:58:42	ryanWneal Can't opt out of other people capturing video OF you and uploading it to Facebook to be indexed.
MichaelKitces	720325263960207361	2016-04-13T18:58:20	ryanWneal No, they're giving the gov't an opening to hundreds of millions of aggregate cameras w/ filters to specific individual though?
MichaelKitces	720324927300222976	2016-04-13T18:57:00	ryanWneal Not that I'm entirely making a case against this. But it's a notably 'blurry' line here...
MichaelKitces	720324836388651009	2016-04-13T18:56:38	ryanWneal Perhaps, but with Facebook's ludicrously wide reach, is that a distinction without a difference?
MichaelKitces	720324674794754048	2016-04-13T18:56:00	ryanWneal It's only a difference until the gov't subpeonas Facebook?

MichaelKitces	717456027801792512	2016-04-05T20:57:01	grademyadvisor For most advisors will likely show up as margin compression long before it ever hits top-line fees: 
MichaelKitces	717455836398952451	2016-04-05T20:56:15	grademyadvisor AVERAGE fee may be compressing slightly, only b/c there are still advisors charging 2%+ who are now being pushed towards 1%.
MichaelKitces	717455753708175360	2016-04-05T20:55:56	grademyadvisor Broad-based advisor benchmarking studies not showing it at all. Median staying flat.
MichaelKitces	717454745699487744	2016-04-05T20:51:55	grademyadvisor And I'd argue major forces of fee compression - commoditization of indexing/asset allocation - predates robos anyway.
MichaelKitces	717454647607353348	2016-04-05T20:51:32	grademyadvisor It's worth noting there's virtually no evidence it's actually causing fee compression. Advisors not changing fees (yet?).
MichaelKitces	717453434618773504	2016-04-05T20:46:43	grademyadvisor The robo-advisors presumed that "low cost" and fee level was a self-marketing mechanism with low CAC. :/
MichaelKitces	717452622890840065	2016-04-05T20:43:29	grademyadvisor It was really painful to see creative innovation go charging full steam in the wrong direction. :/
MichaelKitces	717452404560670722	2016-04-05T20:42:37	grademyadvisor Could have saved them a lot of time &amp; momentum if they just read this from 2011. :/ 
MichaelKitces	717451727696478209	2016-04-05T20:39:56	grademyadvisor But yes, only potential competitive advantage they COULD have is lower CAC. But that's not what they set out to build...
MichaelKitces	717451528131489792	2016-04-05T20:39:08	grademyadvisor Right, except they're running TV commercials &amp; taxicab ads. Not exactly client acquisition innovation. :/

MichaelKitces	717446941949427712	2016-04-05T20:20:55	grademyadvisor Thus a wide range of new CAC initiatives, including account aggregation (which Personal Capital validated for lower CAC).
MichaelKitces	717446844113149952	2016-04-05T20:20:31	grademyadvisor The retail robos have been pivoting to the CAC challenge after realizing it's breaking them.
MichaelKitces	717446609806761984	2016-04-05T20:19:35	grademyadvisor And the institutional platforms launching robos are specifically leveraging existing brand, not viewing it as CAC changer.
MichaelKitces	717446530375032834	2016-04-05T20:19:17	grademyadvisor It was in no way, shape, or form, part of the discussion when the roob-advisors launched.
MichaelKitces	717446478491475969	2016-04-05T20:19:04	grademyadvisor That's because I've been writing about this as a robo issue for 4 years, and VCs read my blog. ;)
MichaelKitces	717432394219970562	2016-04-05T19:23:06	grademyadvisor And that the entire origin of the "1% AUM fee" for financial advisors is that it's a CAC for asset managers, not for advice.
MichaelKitces	717432273704976384	2016-04-05T19:22:37	grademyadvisor Arguably *THE* primary fault and failing point of robo-advisors is that they failed to realize it's a CAC game.
MichaelKitces	717432055416676352	2016-04-05T19:21:45	grademyadvisor Your estimate of robo-advisor CAC is off by as much as 5X from what others have estimated, which breaks the model.
MichaelKitces	717431924994797568	2016-04-05T19:21:14	grademyadvisor Except robo-advisors didn't actually innovate on CACs at all. They're getting buried by CACs instead.

MichaelKitces	716674495042490368	2016-04-03T17:11:29	ChrisGrandecom You can build a great solo/lifestyle practice w/ flat fees, and perhaps grow a larger firm in a niche.
MichaelKitces	716674378503684096	2016-04-03T17:11:01	ChrisGrandecom Flat fee is radically more difficult to sustainably scale. Even Vanguard doesn't do flat fee, they just do lower AUM fee...
MichaelKitces	716674203492229120	2016-04-03T17:10:19	ChrisGrandecom Fixes some, but not all. Fee stickiness and margin squeeze w/ rising staff costs is a serious structural issue.

MichaelKitces	715620782257397760	2016-03-31T19:24:24	daniel_egan Which has significant implications for the competitive landscape. pmarca
MichaelKitces	715620670579863552	2016-03-31T19:23:58	daniel_egan It means that you'll likely see EVERY major asset manager pursue this, simply b/c it's proprietary product channel. pmarca

MichaelKitces	715606243369426944	2016-03-31T18:26:38	PhilBoscarino You're assuming that as AI improves, advisors won't change and evolve their service model too. gweirydd

MichaelKitces	715605019970678784	2016-03-31T18:21:46	gweirydd The point is not "tech isn't useful". The point is "tech isn't competition, it's complementary and augmenting."
MichaelKitces	715604926085390336	2016-03-31T18:21:24	gweirydd Right, so advisors can serve more clients, more effectively, and have more successful businesses. Exactly as tech always has.
MichaelKitces	715604730647617538	2016-03-31T18:20:37	gweirydd Robo-advisor tools don't take market share from actual advisors. It's technology advisors can use, just as .coms were. pmarca
MichaelKitces	715604624644968448	2016-03-31T18:20:12	gweirydd In other words, my prediction is "robo-advisor technology will be the standard that every HUMAN advisor uses in 10 years." pmarca
MichaelKitces	715604386811129856	2016-03-31T18:19:15	gweirydd We don't have robo-psycho-therapists either. There's a reason.
MichaelKitces	715604334386524161	2016-03-31T18:19:03	gweirydd There's a fundamental difference between machines that make widgets and the human-to-human dynamics of advice.
MichaelKitces	715603491612450816	2016-03-31T18:15:42	.gweirydd Look at the growth of advisory industry in past 20 years. It is BOOMING, directly parallel the rise of techonlogy tools! pmarca
MichaelKitces	715603375585378304	2016-03-31T18:15:14	gweirydd Yes, tech will make it simpler, easier, faster, better. And advisors will THRIVE in that environment. Thanks to the tech. pmarca
MichaelKitces	715603232719024129	2016-03-31T18:14:40	gweirydd The technology doesn't replace the advisor. It AUGMENTS the advisor. And it doesn't solve the distribution challenge. pmarca
MichaelKitces	715603124849930243	2016-03-31T18:14:14	gweirydd Take EVERYTHING you said. Put it in a computer. Give THAT to an advisor. Now you have a more efficient valuable advisor. pmarca
MichaelKitces	715603046550650880	2016-03-31T18:13:56	gweirydd The point was that if you're listing the things a computer does, you're missing the value the advisor actually provides. pmarca
MichaelKitces	715602820611907584	2016-03-31T18:13:02	gweirydd The technology will survive, tech always marches on. The purported disruption just isn't happening. Wrong product fit. pmarca
MichaelKitces	715602671701532674	2016-03-31T18:12:26	gweirydd The sad thing is these challenges for robos was entirely predictable, but they didn't research the marketplace first. pmarca
MichaelKitces	715602566416109568	2016-03-31T18:12:01	gweirydd Look at the landscape. Multiple robos acquired for advisors. Asset managers building them. Existing robos pivoting. pmarca
MichaelKitces	715602479900176384	2016-03-31T18:11:41	gweirydd Robos spend $800 to acquire a client paying $60/year is a fundamentally broken business model. pmarca
MichaelKitces	715602301046693888	2016-03-31T18:10:58	gweirydd Right. So 90s tech didn't replace advisors, It's used by advisors for greater efficiency. Robos going the same path. pmarca
MichaelKitces	715602130309087232	2016-03-31T18:10:17	gweirydd You might spend some further time looking at the advisor landscape and what advisors actually do if you think that's all. pmarca
MichaelKitces	715601941997494274	2016-03-31T18:09:32	gweirydd Why would it change? To what? That's what it changed TO when established players adopted the tools to existing models. pmarca
MichaelKitces	715601704666972160	2016-03-31T18:08:36	gweirydd Client acquisition costs. Some robos rumored to be spending $800 to acquire client that pays ~$60/year in AUM fees. BOOM pmarca
MichaelKitces	715601564895940609	2016-03-31T18:08:02	Interesting. Wealthfront going all-in on the theme that ACTUAL advice can be replaced by AI through PFM dashboard. 
MichaelKitces	715601111995060225	2016-03-31T18:06:14	FinTechie Because they're planning their own new from-scratch proprietary solution instead? :)

MichaelKitces	715202045444231172	2016-03-30T15:40:30	MeghnaWBUR But yes as general framework for how it's used for retail media/investors, "futures" for pre-market &amp; "the Dow" for current. :)
MichaelKitces	715201887373508608	2016-03-30T15:39:52	MeghnaWBUR Possible it gets mixed up. Although I find once you watch for it, you may see it really is often used in 'correct' reference.
MichaelKitces	715193281815134208	2016-03-30T15:05:40	MeghnaWBUR In practice, I find that IS how it's typically used by the media though. Mid-day "futures" usually refers back to pre-market?
MichaelKitces	715193137279406081	2016-03-30T15:05:06	MeghnaWBUR But yes as typically used in media, should be "The Dow" during trading hours, and "Dow futures" in after- or pre-market trading.
MichaelKitces	715193046468599809	2016-03-30T15:04:44	MeghnaWBUR Technically Futures basically trade around the clock, so they are trading during 9:30AM-4PM time window as well.

MichaelKitces	715184416746815490	2016-03-30T14:30:27	MeghnaWBUR But that's the basic gist of it. It's the Dow when markets are open, it's futures for the Dow when the markets are closed.
MichaelKitces	715184294117945345	2016-03-30T14:29:57	MeghnaWBUR The actual money-making mechanism of how traders arbitrage Dow futures and actual Dow opening price is more complex.
MichaelKitces	715184208809996288	2016-03-30T14:29:37	MeghnaWBUR Pre-open trading price of the Dow futures, then, ends out reflecting the best collective estimate of where the Dow will open.
MichaelKitces	715184091256197120	2016-03-30T14:29:09	MeghnaWBUR If they correctly estimate that the opening price at 9:30AM is higher/lower than 4PM closing yesterday, they can make money.
MichaelKitces	715183986704777216	2016-03-30T14:28:44	MeghnaWBUR Before the market opens, traders engage in trading with the Dow futures, trying to 'guess' the price the market will open at.
MichaelKitces	715183763433660417	2016-03-30T14:27:51	MeghnaWBUR In the off hours, derivatives traders can do business with futures contracts (not the actual Dow stocks themselves).
MichaelKitces	715183644281806848	2016-03-30T14:27:22	MeghnaWBUR The Dow Jones average trades from 9:30AM to 4:00PM. It only prices during those hours.

MichaelKitces	713743891300818946	2016-03-26T15:06:19	SEIMissyP Not to say that even retiree-centric advisors couldn't provide SOME improvement in service for kids of clients, regardless. :)
MichaelKitces	713743678288871428	2016-03-26T15:05:28	.SEIMissyP Millennials won't live in a tech-savvy nursing home w/ iPads. They won't use a tech-savvy retiree-centric advisor, either.
MichaelKitces	713743517298909184	2016-03-26T15:04:49	SEIMissyP The real issue is who the firm is built to serve, and what service model they provide to deliver it. For Millennials? Or not?
MichaelKitces	713743374768058369	2016-03-26T15:04:15	SEIMissyP You can have young advisors in your firm, delivering retirement advice to retired clients. Still irrelevant for Millennials. :/
MichaelKitces	713743294468063233	2016-03-26T15:03:56	SEIMissyP The issue isn't young advisors at the firm, its a service model for young clients.

MichaelKitces	713739799862124548	2016-03-26T14:50:03	SEIMissyP That aside, for many advisors the biggest problem isn't that they alienate the kids, it's that they alienate the wife. &lt;sigh&gt; :/
MichaelKitces	713739633612431360	2016-03-26T14:49:23	SEIMissyP Yes, fair point there and I don't disagree. But what if advisors DO that and 90%+ of Millennials leave ANYWAY? Mismatch
MichaelKitces	713735776807182337	2016-03-26T14:34:04	SEIMissyP My grandmother's nursing home can build a great relationship with me. I'm still not filling her empty nursing home room later.
MichaelKitces	713735538398732289	2016-03-26T14:33:07	SEIMissyP Though I still question whether most Millennials will ever choose the retirement-centric advisors of their parents. :)

MichaelKitces	713444007444094977	2016-03-25T19:14:41	This is what happens when rShowerThoughts gets philosophical with finances: 
MichaelKitces	713439824850632704	2016-03-25T18:58:03	oneluckyjosh I may still circle back at some point. Certainly enjoyed the education of Level 1 (being the nerd that I am! :) ).
MichaelKitces	713439727437889536	2016-03-25T18:57:40	oneluckyjosh Started down that path. Passed Level 1 early on, then shifted to planning firm where it was less relevant. Got MTAX instead.
MichaelKitces	713435153801035778	2016-03-25T18:39:30	.oneluckyjosh I wouldn't give a free pass to a CFP for jobs that are better suited to the training &amp; education of a CFA. Vice versa, too.
MichaelKitces	713435050809888769	2016-03-25T18:39:05	oneluckyjosh Point wasn't "only" research analysts, but there's clearly a CFA body of knowledge that is DIFFERENT from CFP. Goes both ways.
MichaelKitces	713434920920678400	2016-03-25T18:38:34	oneluckyjosh I know CFPs who don't DO asset allocation or portfolio construction, too. :) Not every CFP is a money manager.
MichaelKitces	713431931526971392	2016-03-25T18:26:42	oneluckyjosh If the CFA has prepared you THAT fully already, challenge the exam, get it done quickly, move on to growth. :) CFPBoard
MichaelKitces	713431783124176896	2016-03-25T18:26:06	oneluckyjosh CPAs insist they should be allowed too. In reality, they have very high FAILURE rate on challenge exams. XYPlanning CFPBoard

MichaelKitces	713428535000633344	2016-03-25T18:13:12	oneluckyjosh Though notably, many advisors ALREADY (and unrelated) require mandatory arbitration with clients, too. NAPFA CFPBoard
MichaelKitces	713428429287383040	2016-03-25T18:12:47	oneluckyjosh This is about legal disputes between you and CFPBoard. Not you and your client. NAPFA
MichaelKitces	713428309724504065	2016-03-25T18:12:18	oneluckyjosh Huh? This has nothing to do with NAPFA. This means you can't sue the CFPBoard for a "bad" disciplinary event. Arbitrate.

MichaelKitces	704450355199918080	2016-02-29T23:37:07	RetirementQuant The issue isn't that the annuity was 'bad' per se, but that the alternative TO the annuity was stacked against them.
MichaelKitces	704450286736252928	2016-02-29T23:36:51	RetirementQuant Because it's not clear that their lump sum pension buyout pricing would have given them much choice.

MichaelKitces	699730102050037761	2016-02-16T23:00:31	elliottweir It's hard for someone to refer to you if they literally have NO clue if your fees are $1,000 or $5,000 or $10,000 or $25,000.
MichaelKitces	699729888622809089	2016-02-16T22:59:40	elliottweir Ideally there would be some guidance of what drives the fee range, or even just multiple tiers that have concrete pricing.
MichaelKitces	699729794905276417	2016-02-16T22:59:18	elliottweir Ideally a specific dollar amount, but if you serve a breadth of clients I think a fee range is certainly reasonable.
MichaelKitces	699728882040180740	2016-02-16T22:55:40	elliottweir And I believe the lack of clear website pricing is a material factor in the decline most advisors are seeing in referrals.

MichaelKitces	697878144787812352	2016-02-11T20:21:30	PhilGerb Yes indeed, thanks Phil. Perhaps we'll cross paths at an advisor social media event someday? :)
MichaelKitces	697876860827516928	2016-02-11T20:16:24	So true. Ask them who their most valuable customer is too. That's a fun one. 
MichaelKitces	697875927397756929	2016-02-11T20:12:41	PhilGerb Ironically I'd actually be more encouraged if data said large publisher share of the feed was falling, more opportunity for us! :)

MichaelKitces	697875618436923392	2016-02-11T20:11:27	richardbishopuk Find motivated people, give them tools and resources and opportunity, and then get the hell out of their way. :)
MichaelKitces	697874902280437760	2016-02-11T20:08:37	PhilGerb But if big publishers have a bigger slice of the pie now and LI algo will favor them more, isn't that bad for typical advisor?
MichaelKitces	697874113310912512	2016-02-11T20:05:29	PhilGerb Not trying to be cagey. It's just that the feed is a limited space. If big publishers are now winning, who's losing/replaced?
MichaelKitces	697874022403567616	2016-02-11T20:05:07	PhilGerb Ok but if Pulse tweaked the algo to favor big publishers again, doesn't that mean small publishers will see LESS now?

MichaelKitces	697872690506571778	2016-02-11T19:59:49	Are there ANY advisors already experiencing "hypergrowth" &amp; lacking robo tech is the only blocking point?? T32016 
MichaelKitces	697870114436337665	2016-02-11T19:49:35	PhilGerb Obviously it wasn't a total 1:1 exchange and cannibalization, but it was material.
MichaelKitces	697869670913859584	2016-02-11T19:47:49	PhilGerb Pulse posts were actually partially cannibalizing the CTR on Activity Links. Which matters since the latter converted far better.
MichaelKitces	697869448066293760	2016-02-11T19:46:56	PhilGerb We found a very material uptick in site traffic from LinkedIn when we STOPPED Pulse posts and JUST posted activity links.
MichaelKitces	697869336120311808	2016-02-11T19:46:30	PhilGerb Something you add as a Pulse instead of an activity link does replacing some of your traffic activity. Not purely an add.
MichaelKitces	697868978732081152	2016-02-11T19:45:04	PhilGerb Again, I'm not just talking theories here. We did this. For a long time. And tested. And it was grossly inferior.
MichaelKitces	697868442590912512	2016-02-11T19:42:57	PhilGerb Yes, except we tested and found LI Pulse + CTA converted *WAY* less than blog post + CTA.
MichaelKitces	697866875468955648	2016-02-11T19:36:43	PhilGerb Just because you cast your reel INTO the LinkedIn waters doesn't mean you need to stand over there to reel them in.
MichaelKitces	697866764827435008	2016-02-11T19:36:17	PhilGerb I'm just saying to reel them in, you need your feet firmly planted in your own boat. :)
MichaelKitces	697866216061460480	2016-02-11T19:34:06	soniasimone Original question was about cross-posting content to LI. That's the only part I was ever objecting to. ShareCropping PhilGerb
MichaelKitces	697865821138382849	2016-02-11T19:32:32	soniasimone The point is about what you're accomplishing there as a part of your marketing process, &amp; sharecropping risks. PhilGerb
MichaelKitces	697865714531700736	2016-02-11T19:32:06	soniasimone I certainly didn't say "LI useful never". I have 5,000+ connections and engage there HEAVILY. PhilGerb
MichaelKitces	697865483362689024	2016-02-11T19:31:11	soniasimone Well, &amp; I'm agreeing with it as a channel to distribute links to blog content. Just that duplication is problematic. PhilGerb
MichaelKitces	697865017178398722	2016-02-11T19:29:20	soniasimone Yes, but the opportunity cost risk for sharecropping and having the landlord change the terms is even worse. :/ PhilGerb
MichaelKitces	697864855089504256	2016-02-11T19:28:41	PhilGerb Social media followers and raw traffic stats are vanity. Mailing list conversions related most directly to biz dev results.
MichaelKitces	697864718288027651	2016-02-11T19:28:09	PhilGerb Business development results didn't really manifest until we improved process to drive mailing list sign-ups though.
MichaelKitces	697864559462322176	2016-02-11T19:27:31	PhilGerb Not that social media traffic didn't grow. It's certainly up too. But organic search growth to blog became exponential.
MichaelKitces	697863559443849216	2016-02-11T19:23:32	PhilGerb Traffic that started 3:1 social:organic in year 1 was 1:1 by year 3 and is now 1:5 the other way by year 5. Even w/ 27k followers.
MichaelKitces	697863324306898944	2016-02-11T19:22:36	PhilGerb Although in practice, I've found that the brand equity grows so quickly that organic search growth actually outpaced social.
MichaelKitces	697863141003288576	2016-02-11T19:21:53	PhilGerb The larger your social footprint, the more capability to drive traffic to your digital real estate. Social supports the blog.
MichaelKitces	697862974502019072	2016-02-11T19:21:13	PhilGerb Yes absolutely time on social continues to build, but I find that directly correlated to rising traffic to website.
MichaelKitces	697862314570227712	2016-02-11T19:18:36	PhilGerb If LinkedIn rolls out requirement to pay for reach in 2017, where's the advisor's marketing plan? soniasimone
MichaelKitces	697862083451482112	2016-02-11T19:17:41	PhilGerb Building the equity of your own digital presence and mailing list is FAR harder to lose. Not prone to LI algo change. soniasimone
MichaelKitces	697861942388641792	2016-02-11T19:17:07	PhilGerb Yes, but again that's my point. What someone else's algo gives you today, can be taken away tomorrow. soniasimone
MichaelKitces	697861612993167360	2016-02-11T19:15:48	PhilGerb I find few who advocate for one side or the other ever actually did BOTH and measured results of BOTH side-by-side. soniasimone
MichaelKitces	697861475088625664	2016-02-11T19:15:15	PhilGerb Indeed, I tried both for two years, and measured carefully. LI results were so bad by comparison, dropped Pulse. soniasimone
MichaelKitces	697861291986325506	2016-02-11T19:14:32	PhilGerb Yes, my point is just that writing on blog and sharing link on LI gives them a more sustainable growth path.
MichaelKitces	697861066601189377	2016-02-11T19:13:38	PhilGerb Though in practice my blog drives business to both our B2B and B2C solutions at this point. soniasimone
MichaelKitces	697860990344523780	2016-02-11T19:13:20	PhilGerb Context of my conversation here was driving actual new clients for our advisory firm. soniasimone
MichaelKitces	697860878151110656	2016-02-11T19:12:53	PhilGerb Functionally, both. I'm a partner in a $1.8B RIA, and also have several B2B businesses for advisors. soniasimone
MichaelKitces	697860725289709569	2016-02-11T19:12:17	PhilGerb They're on Google. :) soniasimone
MichaelKitces	697860654259167232	2016-02-11T19:12:00	PhilGerb Our advisory firm clients read my content, not a matter of whether they publish their own? soniasimone
MichaelKitces	697860585145376768	2016-02-11T19:11:43	PhilGerb Not sure I follow. Who do you mean by 'my customers'? soniasimone
MichaelKitces	697860192420155392	2016-02-11T19:10:10	PhilGerb The difference is one of those builds your equity, the other is entirely subject to LI future changes. soniasimone
MichaelKitces	697860083213066241	2016-02-11T19:09:44	PhilGerb Right, but the same is true of a blog. The "app" is email or Feedly or Zite, and the search is Google/Yahoo/Bing. soniasimone
MichaelKitces	697859929844146177	2016-02-11T19:09:07	PhilGerb I see close to 500 monthly profile views on LinkedIn thanks to search. But drive by profile, not Pulse articles. soniasimone
MichaelKitces	697859610443718657	2016-02-11T19:07:51	PhilGerb Well, the advisor's PROFILE is still there to be found in search, regarding of Pulse articles. soniasimone
MichaelKitces	697858459400802308	2016-02-11T19:03:16	PhilGerb Indeed, FB has reinvented its feed algos several times as well. Still the same problem - more writers, limited feed? soniasimone
MichaelKitces	697858222531723265	2016-02-11T19:02:20	GabeMuller_ Thanks Gabe. Was that a suggestion or a hint? :) &lt;3 AmexOPEN
MichaelKitces	697858043351080960	2016-02-11T19:01:37	PhilGerb From what I've seen, Pulse reach seems to decline every month more people push content there? Same problem as FB? soniasimone
MichaelKitces	697857804112158725	2016-02-11T19:00:40	PhilGerb Understood. My point is that they can get MORE by not doing so, and have less risk if LI someday charges for content. soniasimone
MichaelKitces	697857753390432256	2016-02-11T19:00:28	Getting ready to work on Weekend Reading - what's the best industry (or other?) article you read this week?
MichaelKitces	697857677695832064	2016-02-11T19:00:10	PhilGerb And again, the problem with putting the content to LinkedIn is little way to put prospects through a funnel. :/ soniasimone
MichaelKitces	697857511643291650	2016-02-11T18:59:30	PhilGerb I don't count clicks alone, they're meaningless. I do count clicks that take people into funnel that I know converts. soniasimone
MichaelKitces	697857272358309891	2016-02-11T18:58:33	PhilGerb The question is how many of those people would have clicked a link TO the original on their website anyway? soniasimone
MichaelKitces	697857128539807745	2016-02-11T18:57:59	I have to tweet more when I'm not at T32016, it's the only way for me to engage in absentia! :)  
MichaelKitces	697856978069102593	2016-02-11T18:57:23	soniasimone So driving people from LinkedIn to your site rarely eliminates people actually interested in doing business anyway. PhilGerb
MichaelKitces	697856887648296960	2016-02-11T18:57:02	soniasimone Not the least because anyone who's serious about doing business w/ us was going to click through anyway. PhilGerb
MichaelKitces	697856814264774656	2016-02-11T18:56:44	soniasimone But we do have ample internal data that activity conversion is FAR worse on LinkedIn than pulling to our site. PhilGerb
MichaelKitces	697856652918308864	2016-02-11T18:56:06	soniasimone With unlimited resources, I'd just repurpose every article to every possible platform and measure what works. :) PhilGerb
MichaelKitces	697856459359592448	2016-02-11T18:55:20	soniasimone Particularly in our context, since most advisors do NOT have the kind of resources for extensive multi-purposing. PhilGerb
MichaelKitces	697856287137263616	2016-02-11T18:54:39	soniasimone Obviously Facebook is still viable as a platform, but building their equity helped them, not the brand's. PhilGerb
MichaelKitces	697856074985111552	2016-02-11T18:53:48	soniasimone This was the same discussion in 2012-2013 about Facebook. Then they squeezed the algorithm &amp; brands got slammed. PhilGerb
MichaelKitces	697855982735638528	2016-02-11T18:53:26	soniasimone Understood, but the fundamental principle of whether you're building or digital sharecropping remains relevant. PhilGerb
MichaelKitces	697855046248239104	2016-02-11T18:49:43	soniasimone Interesting, perhaps they've improved detection on this issue since I went through it a year ago? PhilGerb
MichaelKitces	697851772560392193	2016-02-11T18:36:42	I wonder - isn't the 'slow' 15% stock market decline since mid-2015 exactly how Yellen wants a modest rate increase scenario to play out??
