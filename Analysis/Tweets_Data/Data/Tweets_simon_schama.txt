simon_schama	701564898023755776	2016-02-22T00:31:20	robinmoss86 JewishBookWeek thank you so much - very much my first thoughts on this profound subject
simon_schama	701454915160375296	2016-02-21T17:14:18	djjohnso robrowlands PaulLewis and her opponent will be TRUMP for god's sake; you think Dem voters are going to sit on hands?
simon_schama	701454726890704897	2016-02-21T17:13:33	djjohnso robrowlands PaulLewis she's ended up against TPP; no one will care about flipflops by November
simon_schama	701454468748066816	2016-02-21T17:12:32	djjohnso robrowlands PaulLewis the point  is that Guardian story didnt make it clear what actually happened, quite the opposite
simon_schama	701454159921463297	2016-02-21T17:11:18	djjohnso robrowlands PaulLewis point taken, but if she's nominated that's a good omen for mobilising the 2008 vote again in Ohio etc
simon_schama	701453346750787591	2016-02-21T17:08:04	robrowlands PaulLewis big Super Tuesday tests are Colorado, Minnesota, Virginia.
simon_schama	701453022002606083	2016-02-21T17:06:47	robrowlands PaulLewis doubt it. They were supposed to be neck and neck in Nevada. Big story was she won Las Vegas  Latino vote handily
simon_schama	701445717819260929	2016-02-21T16:37:46	jsperkins67 PaulLewis exactly; lazy reporters just parroting received opinion, what they assumed would happen and missing real story
simon_schama	701443612140240896	2016-02-21T16:29:23	Clinton narrowly clinches Nevada while Trump wins big in South Carolina  Lazy reporting. Five points NOT narrow win

simon_schama	698575314885177345	2016-02-13T18:31:48	@WSJ@charlesmurray but the notion of Trump as anti-corporate crusader is hilarious; though it might explain why GOP elders so terrified.

simon_schama	683449672376123392	2016-01-03T00:47:54	Some Santorini Assyrtiko to wash the whole lot down. Mustnt forget the capers with the brown butter skate plus a lemony-dark buttery finish
simon_schama	683449148964749312	2016-01-03T00:45:49	Skate in brown butter is what's happening tonight, a few scallops for company; plus goodappetite's excellent Moroccan chickpea stew
simon_schama	683309268536324098	2016-01-02T15:29:59	HarlandGeorgina thanks so much - hope you enjoy the book; much in it we couldnt get into the programmes
simon_schama	682603180492980228	2015-12-31T16:44:15	jchrisallen yes I wont want to miss Hieronymus
simon_schama	682595482481332224	2015-12-31T16:13:39	LeoHickman Oh no neither was the journal type, esp not Rembrandt
simon_schama	682592311457484800	2015-12-31T16:01:03	LeoHickman Rembrandt! If ONLY.. J-L David; Turner; Mondrian; Cezanne, Pieter Bruegel, Giotto!
simon_schama	682591397472518144	2015-12-31T15:57:25	@gialfredsson of Delacroix on artists who came after
simon_schama	682591161807179776	2015-12-31T15:56:29	GavJacobson yes; this fills me with trepidation, if not done well. The line for "inventors" of modernism gets longer with every PhD thesis
simon_schama	682590852724711424	2015-12-31T15:55:15	In New York: the great Stuart Davis at the Whitney, Vigee Lebrun at the Met, and most brilliantly Degas monotypes at MoMA
simon_schama	682590631676526593	2015-12-31T15:54:23	Other great art to anticipate in 2016: Mona Hatoum at Tate Modern; Giorgione and Venetians at RA; and naturally Underwear at the V&amp;A
simon_schama	682590076765908992	2015-12-31T15:52:10	Odd though that Picasso doesnt seem to be among those Under the Influence .. perhaps he's in the show?
simon_schama	682589648619700224	2015-12-31T15:50:28	Above all a great Delacroix show a chance to think again about the dynamics of colour
simon_schama	682589549915156480	2015-12-31T15:50:05	Also good to have Delacroix around in London in year of the Bard with whom he was besotted and possibly with Harriet Smithson too
simon_schama	682589240853684224	2015-12-31T15:48:51	Also hope some of the great Delacroix eye-poppers there: Sardanapaulus, Chios.. plus drawings; he was a complicated, brilliant draughtsman
simon_schama	682588985349292032	2015-12-31T15:47:50	Delacroix overdue for a great show; hope it uses his wonderful journal to the max; rivalled in 19C only by Van Gogh
simon_schama	682588692041601026	2015-12-31T15:46:40	"Influence shows" like Botticelli and Delacroix full of potential illumination but also fraught with simplified or dubious connexions
simon_schama	682588438399422464	2015-12-31T15:45:40	2 big art events in 2016 Botticelli Reimagined (V&amp;A) Delacroix and Rise of Mod Art reflect fashion for "influence" shows
simon_schama	682294744093954048	2015-12-30T20:18:38	At Señor Frog’s in Times Square, It’s Spring Break Forever  chicken enchiladas "like pork sprinkled with fish food"

simon_schama	682294209777393664	2015-12-30T20:16:30	At Señor Frog’s in Times Square, It’s Spring Break Forever  "Too many restaurants have become church.."
simon_schama	682293967111766016	2015-12-30T20:15:32	At Señor Frog’s in Times Square, It’s Spring Break Forever  Buffalo wings which taste like a mild case of acid reflux
