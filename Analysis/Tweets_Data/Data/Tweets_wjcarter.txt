wjcarter	707740960826986498	2016-03-10T01:32:48	TVMoJoe this sounds intriguing Joe, what did he say? was he upset abt Leslie saying DT was nutty, but good for bizness?
wjcarter	707455515006259201	2016-03-09T06:38:33	1st aware of G Martin in notes on R.Soul, re piano bridge on In My Life; opened door to awareness of his indispensable contributions. RIP

wjcarter	706875024809054208	2016-03-07T16:11:53	Who better? And of course, this guarantees a tune-in.   
wjcarter	706493782217388032	2016-03-06T14:56:58	wrdcsc in that scenario, more likely Ryan v Biden v Trump, no? Kind of would define 'unfair treatment' for DT, don't ya think?
wjcarter	705615611393646592	2016-03-04T04:47:26	thanx for this response, makes me wonder why cruz is NEVER challenged on this during any debate. 
wjcarter	705613501423865856	2016-03-04T04:39:03	have any of the myriad fact-check outlets responded to cruz endless refrain abt obamacare being biggest job killer in america?
wjcarter	705609617578061826	2016-03-04T04:23:37	joanwalsh i think rubio has a cold + wanted to limit contact. no brief for rubio but this may not have been awkwardness.
wjcarter	705608174322057216	2016-03-04T04:17:52	MaxBoot AndyKindler but the guys on the stage are all going to support him??
wjcarter	705603026246103041	2016-03-04T03:57:25	so rubio would support a fraud and con man?
wjcarter	705601649520287744	2016-03-04T03:51:57	kasich to wallace attempt to get him to attack trump: "i'm not biting." he seems to know what fox is going for in this "debate.'
wjcarter	705600320374706176	2016-03-04T03:46:40	wow: marco, tell us why trump will be bad on foreign policy. this is how you steer clear of personal attacks and deal w the issues?
wjcarter	705598033019338752	2016-03-04T03:37:35	lesliebialler one q to rubio; no follow up to any one else.
wjcarter	705596694482714625	2016-03-04T03:32:15	fox moderators have gotten excellent reviews for previous debates: the way they paid lip service to Flint issue? cop-out comes to mind.
wjcarter	705595121073414144	2016-03-04T03:26:00	talk abt kiss off on flint: one set up softball to marco? w proviso not to get into political blame game? truly weak
wjcarter	705594524303626240	2016-03-04T03:23:38	yes! Flint!
wjcarter	705592280514633730	2016-03-04T03:14:43	can rubio really come bk just by assailing trump? it hasn;t worked before for him.
wjcarter	705588334198915072	2016-03-04T02:59:02	and of course the other elephant topic in Mich room: Flint!!
wjcarter	705587420406943744	2016-03-04T02:55:24	this is like 40th repub debate: every 1 focused on same topics: economy, immigration, terrorism. never climate change; apple vs fbi, etc.
wjcarter	705585461306257408	2016-03-04T02:47:37	the line abt the NYT interview? do reg ppl even get the concept of off the record?
wjcarter	705581217459134464	2016-03-04T02:30:45	does cruz EVER answer the q he was asked? ever??
wjcarter	705579643206803456	2016-03-04T02:24:30	so much for fox backing off on trying to take down trump. it seems all abt trying to pin him down.
wjcarter	705577541952741377	2016-03-04T02:16:09	i dont understand the attack line that "he doesnt get 50%" from candidates who cant get 25%: how can that be effective?
wjcarter	705575779640410112	2016-03-04T02:09:09	another frontier crossed in pres politics: overt member measuring. meanwhile cruz goes right to stump speech lines.

wjcarter	704885173482033152	2016-03-02T04:24:56	shouldn't pt be emphasized more? May be BETTER for Trump to have also-rans win cpl; keeps em all in race; easier to win in crowded field.
wjcarter	704872510098153472	2016-03-02T03:34:36	Sure this has been noted before, but remember: you can't spell "secession" without SEC.
