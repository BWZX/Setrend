mlevchin	684534718906236928	2016-01-06T00:39:29	Twitter should store my CC#, and one-click _sell_ me more characters, in the increments of 100, for $0.99. Square can process! CC: jack ;-)
mlevchin	684458320229343232	2016-01-05T19:35:54	I love all people, iff their intentions towards others are non-destructive. But also love that SV imports talent :) 
mlevchin	684457003637293056	2016-01-05T19:30:40	Yay immigrants. (Full disclosure, I am one! :-) 
mlevchin	684273637944262656	2016-01-05T07:22:03	Something is intuitively powerful about command line interfaces, from MULTICS and ttys of old, to Spotlight and IM-as-UI. What is it though?
mlevchin	683714773985329152	2016-01-03T18:21:19	Strongly agree. 
mlevchin	683677381630922752	2016-01-03T15:52:44	TheStuFactory affirm!
mlevchin	683445286455263232	2016-01-03T00:30:28	Wondering whether all the Mast Brothers Chocolate expose-ing had any impact on their sales.
mlevchin	683440989378220033	2016-01-03T00:13:24	. benhamner from now on, will form all tweets to sound like complaint-fodder-click-bait, because I just totally hate it, when this sort of
mlevchin	683440331841376256	2016-01-03T00:10:47	Food for thought: I try to minimize complaining on twitter. Separately, pretty sure that my complaining tweets get most retweets/likes.
mlevchin	683433615808593920	2016-01-02T23:44:06	pmarca investigative reporting imitating art? With Narcos, Sicario, and a pile of other narco-content, this seems almost behind the times.
mlevchin	683430815141724160	2016-01-02T23:32:58	JGRentItToday hah, don’t look at me — I’ve had nothing to do with PP for 10+ years!
mlevchin	683312253072838656	2016-01-02T15:41:51	@RamPrak00799461 if you are willing to edit registry to make sure your fonts look right.
mlevchin	683312092674310144	2016-01-02T15:41:12	joshelman I suggest doing it with a hammer.
mlevchin	683311974206193664	2016-01-02T15:40:44	robleathern joshelman even that is -almost- no longer true, save for keyboard shortcuts.
mlevchin	683311755657781248	2016-01-02T15:39:52	stevefleck precisely. Should be mostly effortless pedaling and sprints. Instead it's all low-cadence, mid-power Z3 climbing.
mlevchin	683311488417660929	2016-01-02T15:38:48	stevefleck eg: pairing with a BT device is 99% trivial, 1% hard (codes, etc). Windows treats all cases like it's launching a small nuke.
mlevchin	683310691684454400	2016-01-02T15:35:38	stevefleck "basic" user features aren't basic enough, "power" feature don't give enough power.
mlevchin	683308951576772609	2016-01-02T15:28:43	Every few years, I use Windows, and think hey, they figured it out, it's not (as) bad... only to have it prove me wrong in 5 mins or less.
mlevchin	682963104892768256	2016-01-01T16:34:27	michaelhwan I liked this list: 
mlevchin	682798999166844932	2016-01-01T05:42:21	michaelhwan of course :) happy new year.
mlevchin	682722663433818113	2016-01-01T00:39:01	michaelhwan Someone on our team has reached out to apologize, but please accept my formal one as well. The bug is getting fixed, too.
mlevchin	682703819998793728	2015-12-31T23:24:09	michaelhwan uh sorry! We'll look into it ASAP
mlevchin	682344070488838145	2015-12-30T23:34:38	RIP Ian Murdock, a true innovator and contributor to our world.
mlevchin	682250280017080320	2015-12-30T17:21:57	vicsingh not if, but when. At some point your brain will benefit from all available computing power, in real time.
mlevchin	682237303507439620	2015-12-30T16:30:23	vicsingh they are all conduits for brain to cloud. Now crude, soon less, but all generations on will grow up with real-time augmentation.
mlevchin	682236381779722240	2015-12-30T16:26:43	To clarify, the interface will change (phone, AR, VR, brain plugs) but the choice is either to compute (at all times) or not.
mlevchin	682235711861309440	2015-12-30T16:24:03	The distinction between mobile-first vs not is not fundamental enough. The choice from (roughly) here on is augmented or not: w/CPU or solo.
mlevchin	681576371022241794	2015-12-28T20:44:04	...pendulum swings again. Browser is the one true platform, until someone finds a use case that more CPU, etc, etc. 
mlevchin	681310519035342848	2015-12-28T03:07:40	bubs Thanks for the offer. I’m quite comfortable around the island really — been coming (and riding around) here for many years…
mlevchin	681283398913122304	2015-12-28T01:19:54	bubs thanks, but I am trying to keep away from work, and actively be anti-social :)
mlevchin	681283111339036672	2015-12-28T01:18:46	implausibleblog please see  for advice on that — I strongly prefer video pitches. just send me a YT link here.
