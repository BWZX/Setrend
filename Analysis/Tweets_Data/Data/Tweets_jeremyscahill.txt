jeremyscahill	724312639011196928	2016-04-24T19:02:44	arendtiana chrislhayes um, no. The US overthrew Qaddafi... that was regime change. Obama has also backed regime change in Syria.
jeremyscahill	724311627726725120	2016-04-24T18:58:43	arendtiana chrislhayes That 98 law made regime change in Iraq US policy and was used to justify invasion. It laid groundwork

jeremyscahill	724305941823381504	2016-04-24T18:36:08	chrislhayes He supported neocon Iraq Lib Act in 98, which made regime change law of the land &amp; backed brutal sanctions that hit civilians

jeremyscahill	707952188568502272	2016-03-10T15:32:09	US backed forces raped and murdered nuns, murdered priests, assassinated Romero, overthrew democratic governments. But ignore all of that.
jeremyscahill	707949859714764801	2016-03-10T15:22:54	The analysis from the Clinton camp on all of these issues necessitates ignoring the bloody role of the US.

jeremyscahill	707946493940994048	2016-03-10T15:09:31	Hillary blasts Bernie for: "Cuba fought a revolution of values." Bots cheer. I wonder how many of them know anything about Batista's regime
jeremyscahill	707945443393740800	2016-03-10T15:05:21	We don't have the right to dictate how people resist US-backing of death squads and dictators in their own countries.
