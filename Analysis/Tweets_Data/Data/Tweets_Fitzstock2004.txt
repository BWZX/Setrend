Fitzstock2004	689879030775037953	2016-01-20T18:35:52	This way if this thing keeps going and stops your 1850 and 1875 short, you stay long from below
Fitzstock2004	689878844438925312	2016-01-20T18:35:08	If you took that counter trend trade long, you scale 1/2 here

Fitzstock2004	689875110208106497	2016-01-20T18:20:18	1st hardest trade is staying short(hardest usually pays most), 2nd hardest is CASH (as you try to stay disciplined and NOT listen to media)
Fitzstock2004	689874362489552896	2016-01-20T18:17:19	Should see a higher low coming and then final rip (still short from 1875 and 1850)
