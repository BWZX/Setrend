bswud	724647606966693890	2016-04-25T17:13:47	dynarski anti-racism is the overwhelming mainstream view! He doesn't need to fund that stuff, it's *everywhere*

bswud	723827062402875394	2016-04-23T10:53:14	kadhimshubber you keep bidding for someone's talents until all the supernormal profits are competed away
bswud	723826921822392320	2016-04-23T10:52:40	kadhimshubber ? That's the central prediction of the competitive model. It's borne out by market for footballers &amp; skilled traders
bswud	723826299601620992	2016-04-23T10:50:12	kadhimshubber since only small % of CEO benefits goes to CEOs I assume that they have firm-specific skills etc
bswud	723826185688461312	2016-04-23T10:49:45	kadhimshubber in very competitive CEO market we might expect ~100% to go to CEOs (similar to footballers or traders)

bswud	722388336220971008	2016-04-19T11:36:15	BDSixsmith the answer is obvious: they politicise it to mobilise (democratic) support for themselves or their agenda

bswud	722376892393877505	2016-04-19T10:50:46	ellegist what's "unnecessary" about saving the lives of thousands of creatures who might suffer? or preventing their suffering?
bswud	722376556656635905	2016-04-19T10:49:26	ellegist starving whales is probably an unfortunate but necessary evil if krill suffer, since they kill trillions. Reckon chance is ~5%

bswud	722374707106967553	2016-04-19T10:42:05	ellegist I think the bigger problem w.r.t. fish is that killing lots of large ones increases population of r-selected tiny ones whose lives
bswud	722374520095535104	2016-04-19T10:41:21	ellegist if their lives aren't worth living &amp; killing is costless. Seems very unlikely their lives are bad enough to not be worth living

bswud	722104512236908545	2016-04-18T16:48:26	areyousurebruv it still seems that the Catholic church's tradition contradict both socialism &amp; feminism. Some ideals &amp; principles aside
bswud	722104059763814401	2016-04-18T16:46:38	areyousurebruv but I'm not a Catholic &amp; I'm certainly not trying to define Catholicism or police its borders from the outside
bswud	722103881942085633	2016-04-18T16:45:56	areyousurebruv in practice I mean. Like several very important Germans have been anti-property too
bswud	722103771690614784	2016-04-18T16:45:29	areyousurebruv idk anything about Ambrose or Aquinas but it doesn't seem that the general tradition of the Catholic church is anti-property
bswud	722102393513631744	2016-04-18T16:40:01	areyousurebruv I mean specific traditions &amp; folkways we can point to
bswud	722102326618681345	2016-04-18T16:39:45	areyousurebruv sure but it does seem to me that traditional ways of nearly every community go against communism &amp; feminism
bswud	722101631148548097	2016-04-18T16:36:59	areyousurebruv OK so it has nothing to do with tradition / traditions / traditional ways / traditionalism generally?
bswud	722100748650225664	2016-04-18T16:33:29	areyousurebruv how do you combine trad / regressive with pro-feminism?!
bswud	722100204963545088	2016-04-18T16:31:19	areyousurebruv yes. I wasn't sure if it was real or ironic. The combination in your bio is so unconventional as to need extended checking

bswud	720946774836387844	2016-04-15T12:08:00	stianwestlake CO2 tax incidence would be in proportion to your inelasticity to consuming &amp; producing goods that involve CO2
bswud	720946656724787200	2016-04-15T12:07:32	stianwestlake VAT incidence is roughly what you would expect; it's slightly progressive over life cycle (could make v. prog w transfers)
bswud	720946452839723008	2016-04-15T12:06:43	stianwestlake switching to LVT would fall entirely on current landowners since it would immediately price in 
bswud	720946268147724289	2016-04-15T12:05:59	stianwestlake 1. VAT for all revenues would only distort toward leisure (and to some extent to do with elasticities for different goods)
bswud	720946082302332929	2016-04-15T12:05:15	stianwestlake 2. raising all revenue from CO2 would be costly because it would excessively distort away from activities producing it
bswud	720945935627501568	2016-04-15T12:04:40	stianwestlake 3. proper LVT should be close to lump-sum, and not have any distortionary behavioural effects
bswud	720944665059594240	2016-04-15T11:59:37	I feel kinda mean now :( 
bswud	720944082315517952	2016-04-15T11:57:18	GeorgeMonbiot a theory that explains everything explains nothing - how is anti-neoliberal Donald Trump the fault of neoliberalism?

bswud	720602492359335936	2016-04-14T13:19:56	RAVerBruggen iirc mattwridley comes out hard for contentless sexy son sexual selection in 
bswud	720602206244876288	2016-04-14T13:18:48	RAVerBruggen think what the marginal individual would do. Self-fulfilling sexy son scenario seems intuitively plausible to me
bswud	720601802966704128	2016-04-14T13:17:12	RAVerBruggen with initial push in the right direction, could become self-fulfilling. They find it sexy because it'll make their kids sexy
bswud	720600986386067457	2016-04-14T13:13:57	RAVerBruggen but how could sexiness otherwise be maladaptive?
bswud	720600938638143488	2016-04-14T13:13:46	RAVerBruggen I mean if it directly cut their biological fertility or their kids', or lowered their sexiness in some other way, maybe
bswud	720598822876016640	2016-04-14T13:05:22	RAVerBruggen [I believe beards correl w T, but] is that true? once it's started it has its own momentum, not driven by original correlation
bswud	720597864716611584	2016-04-14T13:01:33	RAVerBruggen seems to be that the beginning needs to be non-random, but it can run away with itself organically

bswud	718014816695279617	2016-04-07T09:57:27	sanderwagner I'm not saying they're not all different &amp; distinct but if you're trying to use an efficiently small range of meta-genres...
bswud	718014613250514944	2016-04-07T09:56:38	sanderwagner I was thinking: opera AND classical; easy listening, big band, oldies AND musicals; folk, bluegrass, blues, country AND gospel
bswud	718013927561564160	2016-04-07T09:53:55	sanderwagner it's interesting how different in size the categories are there. Some probably have more releases than five others together

bswud	717830115204456448	2016-04-06T21:43:30	Meaningness I mostly agree with your main substantive claims, but think that some details of the narrative are far off
bswud	717829994848854016	2016-04-06T21:43:02	Meaningness I think it's pretty hard to cut our disagreement exactly at the joints without something quite explicit
bswud	717829522683465728	2016-04-06T21:41:09	Meaningness this is one of those rather rare situations where it's genuinely helpful to write down a formal model! :)
bswud	717827833666674689	2016-04-06T21:34:26	Meaningness but outside of a liquidity trap saving = investment. Putting money in the bank doesn't destroy it; the bank lends it out!
bswud	717827708462501889	2016-04-06T21:33:56	Meaningness as a CB could try and boost (high risk) investment instead of the low risk investment that savers are typically doing
bswud	717827572902531072	2016-04-06T21:33:24	Meaningness 2. so, it's at least conceivable that by changing returns *structures* (reducing low risk yields relative to high risk) you

bswud	717826967333109764	2016-04-06T21:31:00	Meaningness QE would be very distortionary!
bswud	717826667390091264	2016-04-06T21:29:48	Meaningness market actors try and hold a given portfolio &amp; QE doesn't effect that. Indeed, without this 'portfolio rebalancing' effect
bswud	717826579154468864	2016-04-06T21:29:27	Meaningness 1. we have good evidence that "the money created by QE" doesn't move in a special way any different from other money
bswud	717816175766409216	2016-04-06T20:48:07	Meaningness also note that QE-style movements &amp; low real interest rates happened under non-CB systems ("free banking")
bswud	717815493789368321	2016-04-06T20:45:24	Meaningness 
bswud	717815080885362689	2016-04-06T20:43:46	Meaningness note that CB *share* of the T-bill market actually crashed at the beginning of the crisis + QE brought it back in line
bswud	717814680056631297	2016-04-06T20:42:10	Meaningness crisis -&gt; uncertainty -&gt; higher demand for money. Central bank should meet this by expanding money supply
bswud	717814492462231553	2016-04-06T20:41:26	Meaningness so I'm broadly with you here, but I don't think that's the point of QE. In my view QE intended to meet spiking demand for money

bswud	716968514553307136	2016-04-04T12:39:49	sanderwagner in corrupt places, I think corruption probably is mostly "greasing the wheels" - e.g. 
bswud	716968251721400321	2016-04-04T12:38:46	ClarkHat I think it's probably to do with the fact that higher IQ -&gt; higher economic &amp; social liberalism/openness
bswud	716968052051599360	2016-04-04T12:37:58	sanderwagner there's a reason that only Nordics have come close to this kind of open database thing
bswud	716967969167908864	2016-04-04T12:37:39	sanderwagner no way. You need secrecy &amp; offshore to defend yourself against all the corrupt govts outside of N Euro &amp; NE Asia

bswud	716963826617417728	2016-04-04T12:21:11	Sam_Dumitriu we reasonably predict/expect the property rights system to lead to; not on the rules of the system in themselves

bswud	715211412998602752	2016-03-30T16:17:43	ByrneTofferings J_J_Driver when you compare directly to Medieval millenarianism it's insane just how similar they are
bswud	715211305137938432	2016-03-30T16:17:17	ByrneTofferings J_J_Driver I think easily the best way to understand Marxist communism is as Millenarian socialist cult
bswud	715211232232517632	2016-03-30T16:17:00	ByrneTofferings J_J_Driver imo reading Marx is one of the worst ways to get at Marx's actual ideas. Which I think are bad ideas

bswud	714443147850416129	2016-03-28T13:24:54	chmtp OK but regular siblings &amp; non-identical twins inherit much less politics than identicals. Important point

bswud	713345502566289408	2016-03-25T12:43:15	Since satisfying preferences usually enhances welfare/well-being then hedonists ought to aim at preference satisfaction as intermediate goal

bswud	712969734262796288	2016-03-24T11:50:05	JoshLachkovic working opinion is that it's great for keeping a reference of songs you like, not so good as a general listening tool

bswud	710841909292437504	2016-03-18T14:54:52	JoMicheII Birdyword but you have to plot the projected wealth/income of this cohort into the future. If avg is higher than past cohorts

bswud	710841138945630208	2016-03-18T14:51:48	Zettel314 JonnElledge stianwestlake Birdyword which is why I pointed to other UK cities. Most cities &amp; towns have higher rents now.

bswud	710840491613491200	2016-03-18T14:49:14	JoMicheII Birdyword I'd bet those are driven by composition. Control for condition, survival rates all higher. More placebos too
bswud	710840226634145793	2016-03-18T14:48:11	Zettel314 JonnElledge stianwestlake Birdyword real rents are higher in most UK cities than in the 1960s, 70s, 80s. Everywhere is better

bswud	710839785741557762	2016-03-18T14:46:26	JoMicheII Birdyword I have no idea what you're getting at here. Why does buying your house make you so astoundingly better off?
bswud	710839556669628416	2016-03-18T14:45:31	Zettel314 JonnElledge stianwestlake Birdyword I don't think this matters that much for the point I'm making, though it's interesting
bswud	710839378701115392	2016-03-18T14:44:49	JoMicheII Birdyword quality and quantity of food, clothes, holidays, cars, media, healthcare, education - all better. Just not housing

bswud	710838730467188738	2016-03-18T14:42:14	JoMicheII Birdyword so: in general  buying power has gone up, but it's gone down with respect to certain goods because they're more scarce
bswud	710838307295531010	2016-03-18T14:40:33	JonnElledge stianwestlake Birdyword again, that's just saying London housing has got better (because of what it provides access to)
bswud	710837416312107008	2016-03-18T14:37:01	stianwestlake JonnElledge Birdyword saying demand has risen is the same as saying that London housing is more desirable i.e. better
bswud	710837202448752640	2016-03-18T14:36:10	JoMicheII Birdyword sure, but previous gen seems to have had lower parental wealth and lower wages, so I don't get this
bswud	710835816688435200	2016-03-18T14:30:40	stianwestlake Birdyword yeah that's partly 'never reason from a price change'. Rents are up because what you're renting is much better
bswud	710835683372503040	2016-03-18T14:30:08	Birdyword house price thing doesn't matter if our average cohort wealth is higher. And is other effect just distributional?
bswud	710834836664143872	2016-03-18T14:26:46	Birdyword so what am I missing? If we all accept these numbers then there's no debate to have - we're better off!
bswud	710834405783302144	2016-03-18T14:25:03	Birdyword sure, *some* goods are very expensive now. But most things are more affordable, relative to avg wealth or avg wage, right?
bswud	710834271972401154	2016-03-18T14:24:31	Birdyword I don't get the whole debate. We earn higher wages &amp; will surely have higher average wealth for any given age

bswud	710426904139075584	2016-03-17T11:25:47	_tommylong Pete_Spence typically evidence says that per calorie satiety is lower for liquid than solids &amp; lower for sugar than fat/protein
bswud	710425739477307393	2016-03-17T11:21:10	Pete_Spence so it would be a very very crude way of doing that

bswud	710418277684617217	2016-03-17T10:51:30	TheEconomist marcsidwell you've reminded me of a favourite quotation: 
bswud	710417395928576001	2016-03-17T10:48:00	I think this seems like quite a good point 
bswud	710416858252451840	2016-03-17T10:45:52	declamare robvfour BDSixsmith I think there's something in that, though I have a different theory myself (a bit vague in my head rn)
bswud	710414872316608512	2016-03-17T10:37:59	declamare robvfour BDSixsmith I'd say that's a point in favour of 'policy adjusts towards needs of objective reality, but with a lag' :)
bswud	710414743052427264	2016-03-17T10:37:28	declamare robvfour BDSixsmith Human Rights legislation is incredibly unpopular, precisely for these sorts of reasons. It may well go!
bswud	710413275264098304	2016-03-17T10:31:38	robvfour declamare BDSixsmith sure, my point is that people are clearly willing to accept structures that effectively make many 2nd class
bswud	710412610722783232	2016-03-17T10:28:59	declamare edwest s8mb are the govt buildings in Dubai systematically different from the private buildings?
bswud	710411903030444032	2016-03-17T10:26:11	BDSixsmith presumably you oppose raising (unskilled) immigration from its current level. None of your arguments speak to that!
bswud	710411662420013058	2016-03-17T10:25:13	BDSixsmith I mean, first off you'd need empirical evidence to justify the analogy... But even then it's not a binary open borders vs closed
bswud	710411511869677570	2016-03-17T10:24:37	robvfour declamare BDSixsmith like the current plans to stop migrants from getting any welfare for 5 years?
bswud	710410952341131264	2016-03-17T10:22:24	declamare BDSixsmith and here in the UK people have got less and less generous as claimants have become less &amp; less native British
bswud	710410768903245824	2016-03-17T10:21:40	declamare BDSixsmith I don't think that's implausible at all. US whites in South are much less welfare generous than in North

bswud	710227918065160192	2016-03-16T22:15:05	BDSixsmith because you think the evidence hints towards rejecting big changes generally even if the evidence hints towards them?
bswud	710226275336646657	2016-03-16T22:08:34	KateAndrs BTW it's 46% brokered 49% not, now. Big shift over the last 12 hourd
bswud	710225034015608832	2016-03-16T22:03:38	BDSixsmith he could well be wrong (I believe he is to some extent) but he's not so obviously wrong that it doesn't take an argument
bswud	710224863026352129	2016-03-16T22:02:57	BDSixsmith both valid points but far enough from straight obviousness that they require making. Somin is a thoughtful guy
bswud	710224729479770113	2016-03-16T22:02:25	BDSixsmith 2. Problems appear with second-gens even if the first gens are relatively low crime
bswud	710224651272790018	2016-03-16T22:02:06	BDSixsmith think the main points were 1. Don't control for age, youthfulness of migrants meaning crime is a real issue
bswud	710223223129022467	2016-03-16T21:56:26	BDSixsmith now second-gens may have different rates but that's an interesting enough point that it requires actually presenting it!
bswud	710222970938114048	2016-03-16T21:55:26	BDSixsmith sure, but Ron Unz broke down the numbers and found that controlled for age Hispanics have roughly the same rate as native whites
bswud	710222001785458688	2016-03-16T21:51:35	BDSixsmith and since he points to evidence that immigrants' views are not that diff to natives, what drives vote for Dems?
bswud	710221820482482176	2016-03-16T21:50:51	BDSixsmith sure, when they vote. Give me an estimate of how many states they've changed or political centres they've shifted though!
bswud	710221034075648000	2016-03-16T21:47:44	BDSixsmith I've questioned the 'doubling world GDP' point here  &amp; Borjas has done so elsewhere (better)
bswud	710220842735685632	2016-03-16T21:46:58	BDSixsmith the real question is whether the gains are as high as Somin claims &amp; costs are as low
bswud	710220781997973504	2016-03-16T21:46:44	BDSixsmith I don't think burden of proof shifting is a very interesting point either way!
bswud	710219989844934658	2016-03-16T21:43:35	BDSixsmith would be better if you presented specific objections to his points; his arguments seem strong if his empirical claims are true

bswud	700300253489135617	2016-02-18T12:46:06	JoMicheII toby_n yes, I believe that
bswud	700299923250679809	2016-02-18T12:44:47	JoMicheII toby_n surely *in general* we can agree that we're not going to be in a situation where higher C -&gt; higher AD

bswud	700290188677926912	2016-02-18T12:06:06	JoMicheII UnlearningEcon a good and fair point - didn't mean to suggest I agreed with Noah
bswud	700289740088672257	2016-02-18T12:04:19	JoMicheII UnlearningEcon I think it's OK if Marxist econ considers itself a separate discipline &amp; doesn't intend to be read by econs
bswud	700289125799358464	2016-02-18T12:01:52	JoMicheII UnlearningEcon but if it's written in terms they *know* he will find hard to understand, that's unreasonable
bswud	700289031045844992	2016-02-18T12:01:30	JoMicheII UnlearningEcon  the implication of this research seems to be that Noah should be part of the audience

bswud	700285053243416576	2016-02-18T11:45:42	Zettel314 fair enough - but then I'd like people to keep arguments to public good-y stuff, not private goods that happen to be govt-run

bswud	700284614078763008	2016-02-18T11:43:57	Zettel314 well infrastructure is annoying because it's mostly a private good that govt has banned private investment into
bswud	700284088402448384	2016-02-18T11:41:51	Zettel314 I find the claim 'r is "low" therefore govt should invest more' very weird - reasons for low r are reasons against investment!

bswud	694563357232336897	2016-02-02T16:49:43	timothycbates but real point here is that sales tax levied on final sales of firms will be passed on—but much more efficient than corp tax
bswud	694563126629548032	2016-02-02T16:48:48	timothycbates we don't so much care about how cash they have as returns to investment - they can borrow or get equity to fund if no cash
bswud	694556659302174720	2016-02-02T16:23:06	timothycbates a very useful intro paper on optimal tax literature is

bswud	694555879585234946	2016-02-02T16:20:00	timothycbates lower corp tax -&gt; higher corp returns -&gt; more capital invested -&gt; higher capital / worker -&gt; higher productivity -&gt; wages
bswud	694555564492333056	2016-02-02T16:18:45	timothycbates OK. The burden of a tax is whose consumption &amp; welfare it reduces. Firms don't have welfare, (members of) households do

bswud	691417081422680064	2016-01-25T00:27:32	GabrielDuquette couldn't finish it. Still horrifies me. Only film that really fills me with revulsion.
bswud	691415761357766656	2016-01-25T00:22:18	GabrielDuquette partly. I added them all for Reasons that made sense at the time. Most that were once listed have been watched. Some remain
bswud	691415339003965440	2016-01-25T00:20:37	GabrielDuquette and I know that it's going to be systematically .4 above for body horror a la Cronenberg

bswud	690542228863852544	2016-01-22T14:31:11	sctwea robertwiblin come on, people just say socially desirable stuff in polls! In practice they act as if views are different

bswud	690539584099348480	2016-01-22T14:20:41	sctwea robertwiblin and yes, there are plenty of things that are worth substantial risk of bad outcomes
bswud	690539481917739008	2016-01-22T14:20:16	sctwea robertwiblin in fact they may well *overestimate* both (but evidence is unclear). Clearly these people believe the risk is worth it
bswud	690539382491738112	2016-01-22T14:19:53	sctwea robertwiblin nearly everyone begins smoking with knowledge that (a) it's highly addictive &amp; (b) it shortens lifespan

bswud	690537209317953536	2016-01-22T14:11:14	sctwea robertwiblin talking in terms of maims/kills is framing problem. Reduces LYs, reduces Qe at end, raises Qb at beginning
bswud	690535234543161344	2016-01-22T14:03:24	sctwea robertwiblin effects of parental cessation in this meta-analysis don't seem strong  
bswud	690534749442543617	2016-01-22T14:01:28	sctwea robertwiblin this is *heavily* confounded. Give me an exogenous shock which leads to higher smoking cessation

bswud	690530092490047488	2016-01-22T13:42:58	sctwea robertwiblin where are you getting that smoking stresses people out? Anecdotally, no one reports that. Surely coming from confounds
bswud	690529739153473536	2016-01-22T13:41:33	sctwea robertwiblin what about the large cohort study &amp; v large meta-analysis on female exposure to passive smoking &amp; lung/breast cancer?
