zachdcarter	695489289497350144	2016-02-05T06:09:02	I would call this one for Clinton. Her line about a "smear" was pure nonsense, but he didn't interject. That was the debate.

zachdcarter	694314207676747776	2016-02-02T00:19:41	sharonm00 yes, clearly. but the "Clinton is attack-proof" idea is flawed. numbers fall very low amid attacks.
zachdcarter	694307009705803776	2016-02-01T23:51:05	More re: electability. Sanders has actually hit Trump and hurt him: 
zachdcarter	694296847871938562	2016-02-01T23:10:42	scotth203 phew. for a minute there i though you were just a confused, good-faith kind of twitter troll.
zachdcarter	694295137128570884	2016-02-01T23:03:54	scotth203 you're also confusing "institutional sexism" with "unconscious bias"
zachdcarter	694293535915290625	2016-02-01T22:57:32	scotth203 clear implication was for general presidential elections. senate races don't result in ads all over the country. that was cheap.
zachdcarter	694290959643705344	2016-02-01T22:47:18	scotth203 point is that Karl Rove will fight her a lot harder for a presidency. you know that, and your last tweet was cheap.
zachdcarter	694290123500879872	2016-02-01T22:43:59	DCDave basically. would dispute crisis deepening, but for people left behind by the recovery, it seems just as bad.
zachdcarter	694289584188985349	2016-02-01T22:41:50	scotth203 you're right, a democratic senate campaign in new york state is totally the same as a presidential election.
zachdcarter	694288666357673985	2016-02-01T22:38:11	14. Fin
zachdcarter	694288452230119425	2016-02-01T22:37:20	13. So electability does matter for Dems. But the overriding electability discussion misses every important aspect of the argument.
zachdcarter	694287380514103297	2016-02-01T22:33:05	jeremyslevin there are a lot. but not having any foreign policy advisers is a pretty big oops: 
zachdcarter	694286701464694784	2016-02-01T22:30:23	12. 2016 is a defensive election for Dems in which there is little to no hope of accomplishing any new Dem goal absent a crisis.
zachdcarter	694286358546817024	2016-02-01T22:29:01	11. Liberal pundits who have argued over differing theories of change btw Clinton and Sanders have fundamentally lost the plot.
zachdcarter	694285464925114368	2016-02-01T22:25:28	DCDave my view is that fascists do well after financial crises, and that the u.s. political class has never even tried to grapple w/ that
zachdcarter	694284554295586816	2016-02-01T22:21:51	10. It's "The Economic Consequences Of The Peace" by John Maynard Keynes, which is public domain, and free: 
zachdcarter	694284272513855490	2016-02-01T22:20:44	9. The most important text for this election isn't prior polls or studies or anything from the last 30 years of political punditry.
zachdcarter	694283853926563840	2016-02-01T22:19:04	DCDave yeah, but the Economic Consequences Of The Peace was right: 
zachdcarter	694282661481697281	2016-02-01T22:14:20	DCDave all it takes is political experts misreading the post-financial-crisis electorate
zachdcarter	694281753662369792	2016-02-01T22:10:43	8. And the idea that Trump can't win in the general seems terrifyingly wrong.
zachdcarter	694281657889632256	2016-02-01T22:10:21	7. But the idea that Clinton is clearly more electable than Sanders isn't at all obvious.
zachdcarter	694281487676346368	2016-02-01T22:09:40	6. Against this, Bernie Sanders' campaign has repeatedly shot itself in the foot over nothing, raising clear competency questions.
zachdcarter	694281105122267136	2016-02-01T22:08:09	5. And she runs on her resume every time, which will not play well in an election clearly primed against well-known politicians.
zachdcarter	694280606687973376	2016-02-01T22:06:10	4. Clinton has never actually had to suffer the slings and arrows of a general election campaign.
zachdcarter	694280495912202240	2016-02-01T22:05:43	3. But if Clinton wins, she's probably going to be running against Trump, who is running as both an anti-establishment candidate &amp; a fascist
zachdcarter	694280188826251264	2016-02-01T22:04:30	2. Politicos in general are averse to grappling w/ the possibility of a Trump presidency bc it horrifies them so much.
zachdcarter	694279728862134272	2016-02-01T22:02:41	1. The electability argument in the Dem primary has assumed that Clinton is more electable bc she has less progressive policy positions.

zachdcarter	686205027145379840	2016-01-10T15:16:42	Wow, Bill Clinton endorsed Gore over Bradley in 2000 Dem primary, but Obama will not endorse Hillary over Sanders

zachdcarter	685663457824366592	2016-01-09T03:24:42	AdamsMorgan folks: guy w/ a ~50lb brown pitbull mix w/ white blaze tried to sick his dog on me and my dog on Columbia Rd tonight. Lookout.
zachdcarter	685576689364135936	2016-01-08T21:39:54	Truthbuster needs regulators to do it. thus needs to appoint regulators who would.
zachdcarter	685575823324254208	2016-01-08T21:36:28	Truthbuster yep. i've been covering banking for 10 yrs. matt's wrong on this. a lehman of $639m does no damage. at $639b, it obviously did.
zachdcarter	685575282049310725	2016-01-08T21:34:19	Truthbuster the legal authority already exists in Dodd-Frank. depends on appointments. only item from either Dem that doesn't need a bill.
zachdcarter	685573266220691456	2016-01-08T21:26:18	My favorite trolling is formula is "Oh yea what about X?" when X = a story I broke:  
zachdcarter	685573081188970496	2016-01-08T21:25:34	Truthbuster nope. and when she praised sanders' plan this week, she said clinton's had good stuff too.
zachdcarter	685571823464005637	2016-01-08T21:20:34	Truthbuster i actually broke that story:

zachdcarter	685559601576701953	2016-01-08T20:32:00	Great CitizenCohn piece on the paid family leave debate heating up in 2016 race: 
zachdcarter	685555772940488704	2016-01-08T20:16:47	AndrewPaulJoyce she supports a tax on high-frequency trading. sanders' is much broader.
zachdcarter	685551183235313664	2016-01-08T19:58:33	Clinton's ideas for repo market are perfectly reasonable. But she's mischaracterizing her own plan and her opponent's.
zachdcarter	685550968977649664	2016-01-08T19:57:42	One further thought on Clinton and Sanders re: Wall Street. Sanders' financial transactions tax would hit plenty of shadow banking.

zachdcarter	685488979345584128	2016-01-08T15:51:23	The Clinton campaign has been rather shockingly dishonest about Wall Street this week: 
zachdcarter	685488244230877184	2016-01-08T15:48:27	brainydramas re: Colbert: promising to break up banks "if they get tbtf" dodges whether they are already. in debates she's rejected breakup
zachdcarter	685487882837094400	2016-01-08T15:47:01	brainydramas she didn't call to break up big banks on Colbert and she rejected it in debates.
zachdcarter	685485988722917376	2016-01-08T15:39:30	smg7320 3. that's dishonest, when Sanders is calling to break up such firms.
zachdcarter	685485837652484096	2016-01-08T15:38:54	smg7320 2. Clinton invokes Lehman/AIG, which are TBTF problems, and says Sanders will do nothing about their "shadow banking" issues
zachdcarter	685485529123667968	2016-01-08T15:37:40	smg7320 1. Clinton capmaign isn't using"shadow banking" the way Mike is

zachdcarter	684840175998996480	2016-01-06T20:53:16	(2/3) It's really common for socialists and fascists to do well after economic downturns. That's how Trump/Sanders = 2 sides of same coin.
zachdcarter	684839871043780608	2016-01-06T20:52:03	Trump and Sanders are two sides of the same coin, but I can't back this analysis bc 1/2 of this = true for Clinton.

zachdcarter	684166031460446208	2016-01-05T00:14:27	There are so many ways for the Sanders campaign to go after Clinton on Wall Street. Instead, they chose to go after Gary Gensler.
