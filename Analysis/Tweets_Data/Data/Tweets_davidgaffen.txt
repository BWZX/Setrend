davidgaffen	710165716264046592	2016-03-16T18:07:55	BobPisani has this right, the Fed has essentially come to the Street view here. Markets still only seeing one fed hike by March '17.
davidgaffen	710165249853411332	2016-03-16T18:06:04	One way to look at this: Markets keep being right, and the Fed keeps giving in. Another: Yellen is quietly steering a very dovish course.
davidgaffen	710165229380829184	2016-03-16T18:05:59	Interestingly, eurodollar contracts - when comparing March '16 to March '17 - now at a spread of 38 bp - so still pricing in just 1 hike.
davidgaffen	710165042352640000	2016-03-16T18:05:14	That itself was a downgrade, as Wall St was more expecting 3 hikes in '16 before that.

davidgaffen	697856836641361920	2016-02-11T18:56:50	25) markets - data from BofA not long ago showed the "Fed put" taking longer to come in- going from taper tantrum till now.
davidgaffen	697856654235324416	2016-02-11T18:56:06	24) markets - plus we have a rally in gold, which also either means end times or, ah, never mind, pissing off the gold bugs ain't worth it.
davidgaffen	697856495464140800	2016-02-11T18:55:28	BREAKING: S&amp;P financial index down more than 3 percent; Bank of America, JP Morgan, Citigroup among biggest drags
davidgaffen	697856253155008514	2016-02-11T18:54:30	23) markets - then again, Saut admits he's forever an optimist (naturally, since he trades stocks, not bonds).
davidgaffen	697856129615921152	2016-02-11T18:54:01	22) markets - which should *probably* end soon (your mileage may vary). It's not much, but DJT (transports) up 3% in last 16 days.
davidgaffen	697855747284144128	2016-02-11T18:52:30	21) markets - where's the good parts? Jeff Saut of Raymond James believes we're about 30 sessions into a selling period...
davidgaffen	697855634465804288	2016-02-11T18:52:03	20) markets - and the question continues about worries on impairment of banks, probably most concentrated around Deutsche.
davidgaffen	697855310950703105	2016-02-11T18:50:46	19) markets - so where is the bottom? 1800 doesn't seem like it - dealers say 1800 relatively benign as levels go, if we go thru it slowly
davidgaffen	697855102812626945	2016-02-11T18:49:56	18) markets - "As investors liquidated .... the funding currency had to be bought," - marcmakingsense
davidgaffen	697854732904361988	2016-02-11T18:48:28	17) markets - sov wealth funds, institutions et al supposedly among those selling, unwinding euro and yen carry trades..
davidgaffen	697854539102339072	2016-02-11T18:47:42	16) markets - more on skew here, with a 14-day moving avg. And yes, maybe black was a bad choice. 
davidgaffen	697854069864579072	2016-02-11T18:45:50	15) markets This may in part explain why VIX stays below 30, and we don't see elevated skew, at least right now.
davidgaffen	697853817694633984	2016-02-11T18:44:50	14) markets - they would have contributed to the selling, they're right now leaning against it instead, if only a little.
davidgaffen	697853723423465472	2016-02-11T18:44:27	13) markets - and to some extent, dealer positioning less exposed than it was in August (hard to tell exactly). So whereas in August...
davidgaffen	697853629508820992	2016-02-11T18:44:05	12) markets - macro funds are, and have been, *short* the markets - so they're doing well, not losing. So they ain't panicking.
davidgaffen	697853535489236992	2016-02-11T18:43:43	11) markets - best we can tell (and we have lots of reasons) -- hedge funds started selling, but haven't panicked yet.
davidgaffen	697853436675682308	2016-02-11T18:43:19	10) markets - which brings next question, of course, which is "where is the big panic/capitulation"?
davidgaffen	697853140692029441	2016-02-11T18:42:08	TheStalwart so, more like that line about how it's better to have people assume you're a fool than open your mouth and prove it.
davidgaffen	697853090477817856	2016-02-11T18:41:56	TheStalwart ...than it is "now they don't know what they're doing."
davidgaffen	697852972684992512	2016-02-11T18:41:28	TheStalwart But a 23% drop in Japanese banks is telling, along w/ rally in yen. It's not what's expected. So it's more "worry," (more)
davidgaffen	697852845643718657	2016-02-11T18:40:58	TheStalwart I think we're talking a matter of degrees here. Not that we went from 100% to 0%. But possibly from 24% to 4%.
davidgaffen	697852530542432256	2016-02-11T18:39:43	9) markets - but flattening of the yield curve suggests either A) market worried about recession or B) just doesn't believe Yellen.
davidgaffen	697852411927490560	2016-02-11T18:39:15	8) markets - we were at 65 bp between March '16 and Mar '17 eurodollars at end yr. Now we're at FIVE. So, no rate hikes this yr.
davidgaffen	697852266729095168	2016-02-11T18:38:40	7) markets - but the collapse in expectations between now and next year is extraordinary. 
davidgaffen	697852146780340224	2016-02-11T18:38:11	6) markets - which brings us to fed. Yellen dot plot may say 4 hikes - and Dallas's Kaplan told ReutersBiz that likely to change in March
davidgaffen	697851930337505281	2016-02-11T18:37:20	5) markets so this has gone past where we were early in yr when it seemed like just a "revaluation" of assets. Something else now.
davidgaffen	697851844815646720	2016-02-11T18:36:59	4) markets - obviously all this can be seen in widening CDS in banks and widening debt spreads in banks as well.
davidgaffen	697851713236160512	2016-02-11T18:36:28	3) markets - US banks down 6.7 pct since BOJ went negative. Tokyo bank index even worse - down 23 pct in that time period.
davidgaffen	697851107285065729	2016-02-11T18:34:04	2) While yen/euro trading clearly represents unwind of big carry positions - borrowing - clearly also a rebuke to BOJ/ECB policy.
davidgaffen	697850966129901568	2016-02-11T18:33:30	1) markets - biggest thing happening now is a complete collapse in confidence in central bank prowess. Bank stocks down 18% so far this yr.
