richarddeitsch	725475993192898560	2016-04-28T00:05:30	BruceWizayne I'm not referring to Schilling specific. I'm referring to anything that falls under politics espoused by on air talent.
richarddeitsch	725475471878705152	2016-04-28T00:03:25	Agreed, as I wrote. But the issue I'm focusing on is whether the discipline is selective. 
richarddeitsch	725475003890864128	2016-04-28T00:01:34	Interesting. A Q: Should working under the tag of opinionist give you more leeway here?

richarddeitsch	725473147588321280	2016-04-27T23:54:11	TylerGreenDC Not about Schilling's content here for this point. About an uneven message on who can offer political discourse.
richarddeitsch	725471706152882181	2016-04-27T23:48:28	This is fair question. But that pandora's box has already been open at ESPN, FS1 and NBC. 
richarddeitsch	725471243902799872	2016-04-27T23:46:37	You might dislike the messenger but Schilling's point on selective discipline re: political opinion is valid.

richarddeitsch	723920405958909952	2016-04-23T17:04:09	Joe_Tauriello Lot of noise everywhere, true. But ESPN also produced Thompson's Tiger piece this week and Shelburne's Kobe piece.
richarddeitsch	723919396062793728	2016-04-23T17:00:08	WBBBPB Some FS1 talent are but that's not surprising and there is an argument to make if one uses nuance.

richarddeitsch	723918894092718082	2016-04-23T16:58:08	HumbleRando first_edward I don't agree with that. I think longterm FS1 and NBCSN both have shots to be comp.
richarddeitsch	723916946706685956	2016-04-23T16:50:24	DustinKlavon07 Just general thoughts.
richarddeitsch	723916023724924928	2016-04-23T16:46:44	Just my opinion: FS1's studio plans will fail longterm but execs will get paid and noise will be made. 
richarddeitsch	723915161644470273	2016-04-23T16:43:18	Will be interesting to see if ESPN execs/talent ever respond publicly to FS1. No response gives attack less run. But discipline is tough.
richarddeitsch	723913029491011584	2016-04-23T16:34:50	A sure prediction: Jamie Horowitz/Charlie Dixon/Pete Vlastelica will encourage FS1 talent to blast ESPN publicly. Already happening in fact.

richarddeitsch	722799183162249216	2016-04-20T14:48:48	ESPN has a deep enough MLB bench not to miss Curt Schilling, who I personally find interesting as an analyst (cont).
richarddeitsch	722798988789821440	2016-04-20T14:48:02	High ranking ESPN execs have always told me is that when a certain talent becomes too big a headache, that's usually when the co. reacts.
richarddeitsch	722798654860316674	2016-04-20T14:46:42	He has every right to espouse his believes on his feeds. They in turn have a right to react to that re: putting him (or not) on the air.
richarddeitsch	722798499763347457	2016-04-20T14:46:05	But I think Schilling has placed ESPN in a tough spot here. He knows how management feels and he's pushed the envelope w. them.

richarddeitsch	714847070532853760	2016-03-29T16:09:57	Understood. But I appreciate ESPN's support of women's CBB. Without them, I can't imagine where the sport would be.

richarddeitsch	714824867917524992	2016-03-29T14:41:43	SlugORama I gotta just rep me. SI doesn't censor my opinion so I'll continue to write what I write. If SI takes hits, editors gotta deal.
richarddeitsch	714823769928417281	2016-03-29T14:37:22	SlugORama My take is I'm fine with the Swimsuit Issue. Same take as I've had for 15 years. Can I still like women's sports?
richarddeitsch	714815341516480512	2016-03-29T14:03:52	vikingdrewby True. The Mute or Block is easier. Appreciate the advice.
