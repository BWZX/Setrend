freddoso	725428513151422464	2016-04-27T20:56:50	My take on Cruz/Carly -- serves a couple of purposes. One is that it employs the classic Trump tactic of changing the subject from bad news.
freddoso	725427891454939136	2016-04-27T20:54:21	"The character of Ted Cruz has been revealed over time and with pressure...He is a principled fighter..." understands the Constitution.
freddoso	725427124329283584	2016-04-27T20:51:18	"I am proud of some of the enemies that Ted Cruz has made. It means he's going to fight."
freddoso	725426903981514752	2016-04-27T20:50:26	Says of Cruz: "He's a fighter too...has fought for our religious liberty, for our right to bear arms..."
freddoso	725426712985509888	2016-04-27T20:49:40	She shares one of the songs she made up for Cruz's kids.
freddoso	725426430209744896	2016-04-27T20:48:33	"They're not going to challenge the system. They are the system."
freddoso	725426332834754562	2016-04-27T20:48:10	"Trump and Hillary Clinton are two sides of the same coin," she says. She sells influence from inside the system, he buys people like her

freddoso	725424880443871233	2016-04-27T20:42:23	"and whose lobbyist campaign manager has said he's just playing a part...."
freddoso	725424810780704768	2016-04-27T20:42:07	"If we nominate...a big government NY liberal...who agrees with Hillary and Obama on issue after issue after issue...
freddoso	725424171103215617	2016-04-27T20:39:34	If we are to win, he says, we must unite. And Carly as VP will help him do that if he wins in a contested convention
freddoso	725423959890661377	2016-04-27T20:38:44	Nobody is getting to 1237 delegates, he claims, and "The Hoosier State is going to have a powerful voice in making that clear."
freddoso	725423701387255810	2016-04-27T20:37:42	"Now, some might ask, why now?...It is unusualy to make the announcement as early as we're doing so now."
freddoso	725423590624088064	2016-04-27T20:37:16	Says his kids regularly text Carly. "Might become first VP in history to have a very impressive fluency w heart and smiley face emoticons"
freddoso	725423474525802497	2016-04-27T20:36:48	Says of Fiorina having "looked into the abyss" with cancer, "Maybe that's why Carly isn't intimidated by bullies."
freddoso	725423138994044928	2016-04-27T20:35:28	He goes back to talking about Fiorina -- now about her surviving cancer.
freddoso	725422839722024960	2016-04-27T20:34:17	"If you've always lived a life of privilege, always been told you're the chosen one, that has impacts on the way you'd do your job as POTUS"
freddoso	725422551736922112	2016-04-27T20:33:08	"If the president is a narcissist...abusive and angry, they will not and cannot be a good president."
freddoso	725422450415132673	2016-04-27T20:32:44	"One of the characteristics of bullies -- they feed off of fear"  Someone in the crowd says "Trump" loudly.
freddoso	725422237067653120	2016-04-27T20:31:53	"in one of the earliest debates, Carly confronted Donald Trump....Every one of us remembers the grace/class/elan with which Carly responded"
freddoso	725421455215853568	2016-04-27T20:28:47	Suddenly a bunch of these come out. 
freddoso	725420918504329216	2016-04-27T20:26:39	"She knows, from having spent a lifetime, how to produce jobs, how to expand jobs, how to raise wages."
freddoso	725420773926670336	2016-04-27T20:26:04	"She is also a woman of deep principle," he adds, citing her service on the ACU board.
freddoso	725420703537860608	2016-04-27T20:25:48	"Over and over again, Carly has shattered glass ceilings."
freddoso	725420586646835200	2016-04-27T20:25:20	"A graduate of Stanford and MIT, Carly is brilliant and capable...."
freddoso	725420275794333697	2016-04-27T20:24:06	"Born in Texas -- the very first thing I liked about her..."
freddoso	725420219649417217	2016-04-27T20:23:52	They cut off Cruz and start chanting for "Carly, Carly"
freddoso	725420168176881664	2016-04-27T20:23:40	People here (at this Cruz rally) seem pretty happy with that.
freddoso	725419989260492801	2016-04-27T20:22:57	"I have come to the conclusion that if I am nominated...I will run on a ticket with my vp nominee, Carly Fiorina."
freddoso	725419833437868032	2016-04-27T20:22:20	Says you need someone with a foundation, and someone with character. "How do they treat the clerk at the convenience store?"
freddoso	725419567963627524	2016-04-27T20:21:17	(Sounds a bit like he's subtweeting someone.)
freddoso	725419478775939072	2016-04-27T20:20:56	"If you see a leader who deliberately surrounds himself w people who are not capable, informed, would never stand up to that leader...."
freddoso	725419382185287680	2016-04-27T20:20:33	First criterion: Knowledge. Second criterion: Judgment. "Do they pop off the handle at whatever strikes them at any given moment?"
freddoso	725419070334599168	2016-04-27T20:19:18	Says a potus and vp alike should understand, among others, "Why Carrier left IN and went to Mexico."
freddoso	725418860401283072	2016-04-27T20:18:28	"The characteristics you look for in a VP are the very same ones you look for in a president."
freddoso	725418718667395078	2016-04-27T20:17:54	"You're telling the American people, 'this is an individual I trust...and you can trust to lead this country no matter what might happen
freddoso	725418592620040192	2016-04-27T20:17:24	"When you run for POTUS, one of the most solemn choices you make is the choice of a vp candidate."
freddoso	725418497929543680	2016-04-27T20:17:02	Refers to Trump-Clinton as "a choice between two big-government liberals"
freddoso	725418408171458562	2016-04-27T20:16:40	"The American people deserve a real choice in November -- a choice and not an echo"
freddoso	725418327850504192	2016-04-27T20:16:21	Cruz starts off: "God bless the great state of Indiana"

freddoso	725330490618576896	2016-04-27T14:27:19	At this point, stopping Trump from 1237 would require both a win in IN &amp; keeping him to 100 in CA. Even then he gets close enough to worry.

freddoso	724833156730347521	2016-04-26T05:31:05	CP4070 I expect a Trump-Clinton map to look something like this -- Trump holds on to MS by a point or two. 
freddoso	724832805612589057	2016-04-26T05:29:42	CP4070 No, for the matchups that matter it's exactly what I would have expected.

freddoso	724831928545894400	2016-04-26T05:26:13	CP4070 Sanders, like Kasich, is and remains kind of an unknown quantity because people know he won't win.

freddoso	724778713909334016	2016-04-26T01:54:45	ianpolaris Trump is weaker in literally every poll. There is no data to cling to. Only option is bury your head.
freddoso	724778297687568385	2016-04-26T01:53:06	ianpolaris Nominating Trump would kill it. Down-ballot implosion unlike anything in my lifetime. All the signs are there.
freddoso	724777901132910593	2016-04-26T01:51:32	ianpolaris You don't, actually. He's polling well in PA and WI. Trump will struggle to hold Mississippi.

freddoso	724775433183449088	2016-04-26T01:41:43	ianpolaris He's gotten 38% of the vote, and he'll end up around there when it's all done.

freddoso	724770583506915329	2016-04-26T01:22:27	ianpolaris False hopes. He does worse with Dem voters than even Cruz, which is astounding, frankly.

freddoso	724768147794874368	2016-04-26T01:12:46	ianpolaris These polls are a warning for the wise. Maybe it isn't intended for you, I can't say.

freddoso	724763198897807361	2016-04-26T00:53:06	I want to see someone poll Texas, because I bet Trump trails Clinton there too.
freddoso	724762441893060609	2016-04-26T00:50:06	It's a nice reminder of how primaries are not at all comparable to general elections.
freddoso	724762290046693377	2016-04-26T00:49:30	scbison91 They can't. Their vote is cast by rule.
freddoso	724761734964088833	2016-04-26T00:47:17	It's a pattern. Maybe Trump won your state's primary, but he's the only R who loses the state to Clinton. 
freddoso	724761199133364224	2016-04-26T00:45:09	Clinton already leads Trump in AZ by 8 points. Meanwhile, Cruz and Kasich both lead her.

freddoso	724430630243569666	2016-04-25T02:51:36	But unless he gives them the opportunity, the chances of Trump being nominated on the first ballot are pretty good.
freddoso	724430387632459777	2016-04-25T02:50:38	The other interesting quirk about Indiana is that if Cruz wins, he's going to be unleashing a lot of Kasich delegates for 2nd ballot and on.

freddoso	724417080095707136	2016-04-25T01:57:45	TrumpsArmy Actually, quite the reverse. He could win more delegates in OR and NM than Kasich could in IN.
freddoso	724416653019090944	2016-04-25T01:56:03	Whatever -- Indiana is all that matters. Kasich isn't running a campaign there, so if you want to stop Trump there's now only one choice.
freddoso	724416510291124224	2016-04-25T01:55:29	But the fact is, OR and NM are proportional delegate states anyway. So it's kind of a weird compromise.
freddoso	724416396793245697	2016-04-25T01:55:02	I take this as a clear hint that Kasich isn't going to take much of a bite out of Trump in the Northeast.

freddoso	722911091076894721	2016-04-20T22:13:29	WOODROWNGUS BradThor But in fact, the argument works anyway because polls for Nov will be far less mutable.

freddoso	722845380887646208	2016-04-20T17:52:23	emilykholcomb (1) Their actual numbers are negligible in general election terms, and (2) Trump does worse among Ds than Cruz or Kasich.
freddoso	722844040513916928	2016-04-20T17:47:03	emilykholcomb He's changed minds all right. It's not easy to become that unpopular.
freddoso	722843766533566464	2016-04-20T17:45:58	Maggiesdad34 The whole point is that no relationship can be established between A and B.

freddoso	722838780558893056	2016-04-20T17:26:09	emilykholcomb Again, polls taken at this point of the year in the last three elections predicted the outcome accurately.
freddoso	722838654553559041	2016-04-20T17:25:39	emilykholcomb It's not my job to pick a nominee, but I would pick literally anyone off the street before Trump if I wanted to win.
freddoso	722838494519934976	2016-04-20T17:25:01	emilykholcomb I don't remember where this started, but my whole point is that primaries and generals cannot be conflated as you just did.
freddoso	722838314412322816	2016-04-20T17:24:18	emilykholcomb That includes MS, where Trump won the primary. Again, primaries don't indicate anything about general election performance.
freddoso	722838097763938304	2016-04-20T17:23:26	emilykholcomb Polls have, however, shown Trump struggling/losing to HRC in deep Red states where Cruz, Kasich beat her easily.
freddoso	722837679738589184	2016-04-20T17:21:47	emilykholcomb He might win some of them, but more important point is that no general election poll shows Trump outperforming him anywhere.
freddoso	722837330730598402	2016-04-20T17:20:23	emilykholcomb They're not primary polls. They're general election polls. And they were reliable in Apr 2004, 2008, and 2012
freddoso	722833207503282176	2016-04-20T17:04:00	Maggiesdad34 We're not talking about whether A or B is true or false. This is about what the relationship is between them.
freddoso	722832640634695680	2016-04-20T17:01:45	MforestB Well, the issue is that there are two of them running against each other.
freddoso	722832564197711873	2016-04-20T17:01:27	emilykholcomb Primary wins don't mean anything at all for the general election. Not even a little bit.

freddoso	722828418413412353	2016-04-20T16:44:59	Maggiesdad34 A and B are just propositions about any given candidate. The argument is that there is no relationship between them.

freddoso	719725414617198594	2016-04-12T03:14:45	rusynka willie_mays24 The people voted. And Cruz organized to get his delegates elected, and Trump didn't. It's that simple.
freddoso	719724887166746624	2016-04-12T03:12:39	rusynka willie_mays24 They voted March 1. Only reason Trump lost is that he didn't work for it.

freddoso	717174568968794112	2016-04-05T02:18:36	SeanLeake The key is not to nominate someone who can take the party down with him so that it isn't necessary.
freddoso	717174370964086784	2016-04-05T02:17:49	SeanLeake Cruz will at least lose respectably. (And that citizenship thing is bogus, btw.)

freddoso	717173227240316928	2016-04-05T02:13:16	SeanLeake Trump really doesn't fit it, and it shows up in exit polls that have so many R primary voters thinking 3rd party.
freddoso	717173050433601536	2016-04-05T02:12:34	SeanLeake And they won't just vote for the R candidate because he's the R candidate, esp if it's someone who doesn't fit that framework.
freddoso	717172836947730433	2016-04-05T02:11:43	SeanLeake A lot of people vote R because they're political conservatives, love the Constitution. They aren't just party people.

freddoso	716315711182798848	2016-04-02T17:25:48	garyalan82 Amazing to look at, actually. SC shows how rise in imports can go hand in hand w rise in manuf jobs. 
freddoso	716314124443979776	2016-04-02T17:19:30	garyalan82 Trade balance is  highly misleading anyway. Top 14 SC imports (except for uranium) are components for cars &amp; planes built here
freddoso	716312301641437184	2016-04-02T17:12:15	garyalan82 Even so, SC balance of trade within NAFTA is close to even. Not that trade deficits are inherently bad, but some think they are

freddoso	715720453713604609	2016-04-01T02:00:28	NAAPC We'll see.
freddoso	715720227338629121	2016-04-01T01:59:34	NAAPC There's an entire history and an entire movement you need to study. It's not enough to conduct thought experiments on this issue.
freddoso	715719815747375104	2016-04-01T01:57:56	NAAPC It was much worse in the 90s. Less than 30% pro-life. You can look that up. Looking things up is our whole difference of opinion here
freddoso	715719255979765760	2016-04-01T01:55:42	NAAPC Also the drop in the abortion rate, which has both cultural and legal origins.

freddoso	715718109806485506	2016-04-01T01:51:09	NAAPC (1) No, I mean, you really did. Your thinking took you to a conclusion, but you failed to refer to what came before you.
freddoso	715717064820830208	2016-04-01T01:47:00	NAAPC (3) The issue provides a window into the fact that Trump doesn't know how much he doesn't know. Hence the criticism.
freddoso	715716598519050240	2016-04-01T01:45:09	NAAPC (2) Instead of looking to some "GOP Gospel," you should look at the pro-life movement, which has had lots to say about this.
freddoso	715716299905609729	2016-04-01T01:43:57	NAAPC (1) Instead of hypothesizing from scratch, you should look at history -- ie, how were pre-Roe abortion laws enforced, and why.
freddoso	715700734562422784	2016-04-01T00:42:06	Patrickm55P Winning isn't the point. That's gone if Trump gets it anyway.
freddoso	715697586330402816	2016-04-01T00:29:36	Patrickm55P I'm just saying IF he gets it. Obviously that's better.
freddoso	715696928986542080	2016-04-01T00:26:59	Patrickm55P Then a 3rd party gives you a chance to vote for someone with a small but non-zero change of beating her.
freddoso	715696669237645312	2016-04-01T00:25:57	Patrickm55P There is no "costing Trump the election." He has 70% unfav. He's DOA. If anything, he costs someone else the election.
freddoso	715696437477007364	2016-04-01T00:25:02	Patrickm55P You're assuming Trump could win, which is incorrect. But you're also assuming I'd want him to.

freddoso	715690642899271680	2016-04-01T00:02:00	Taniel TimAlberta Yeah, but that was also a 50-50 race. I'd look to SC as the model here.

freddoso	715687112222179329	2016-03-31T23:47:59	NegusWolfgangus Interesting. You think Hillary will give him a cabinet post or something?

freddoso	715686404311764992	2016-03-31T23:45:10	Also, Trump picked exactly the right guy to attack while campaigning in the state. Congrats! 
freddoso	715685525412126720	2016-03-31T23:41:40	This is probably good enough to take all the delegates.

freddoso	715400745416138753	2016-03-31T04:50:03	DavidBTexas We're often talking about 15 year-olds in the most vulnerable position they'll ever experience in their lives.
freddoso	715400548535500802	2016-03-31T04:49:16	DavidBTexas Just one of many examples: When people turn to drugs or alcohol.
freddoso	715400393048469509	2016-03-31T04:48:39	DavidBTexas I think you're wrong on that one. People always bear responsibility for their actions, but also act based on pressure &amp; lies.

freddoso	715399596143304704	2016-03-31T04:45:29	DavidBTexas There's a good reason women tend to be slightly more pro-life than men in nearly every poll ever taken on the topic.
freddoso	715399425984573440	2016-03-31T04:44:49	DavidBTexas But even beyond that, how many women are pressured into abortions? Quite a few.
freddoso	715399309353549824	2016-03-31T04:44:21	DavidBTexas Even the idea that all named "victims" are somehow equal or equally victims is just an incorrect assumption.

freddoso	715398152832987136	2016-03-31T04:39:45	DavidBTexas And there's no equating of anything here. It's about prudential questions of law and law enforcement.

freddoso	715397559120846849	2016-03-31T04:37:24	DavidBTexas I'm saying you're discarding them too lightly and should reconsider it. That's my criticism.

freddoso	715395633796882432	2016-03-31T04:29:45	DavidBTexas *care. This is what Chesterton would say, I have to think.
freddoso	715395285644480512	2016-03-31T04:28:22	DavidBTexas No, it's just unwise to discard the wisdom of an entire movement of people who are about an issue based on your instincts.

freddoso	715346542333308928	2016-03-31T01:14:40	@nettocharles Yeah, I know.

freddoso	715342736505724928	2016-03-31T00:59:33	drcme I think most everyday people don't think about this because it seems so unattainable, but the mainstream movement people do.
freddoso	715342553982197765	2016-03-31T00:58:49	He's trolling you America. He's trying to see how completely insane he can act and still win. 
freddoso	715342319709343744	2016-03-31T00:57:54	drcme Me too, thanks for chiming in.  It's actualy a lot rarer nowadays than it was about five months ago.
freddoso	715341094683324417	2016-03-31T00:53:02	My question for Trump: have you ever paid for or encouraged an abortion?
freddoso	715341775066386432	2016-03-31T00:55:44	drcme Not under the laws of Indiana. The jury found that the baby was born breathing.
freddoso	715341605666816000	2016-03-31T00:55:03	Literally facepalmed just now. 
freddoso	715341415111217152	2016-03-31T00:54:18	drcme To say it's murder is more moral statement than precise definition for criminal law. The law captured this distinction pre-Roe.
freddoso	715340325372305408	2016-03-31T00:49:58	drcme He ends up being a quack, or at least something goes wrong, she turns up at hospital, cops talk to her, she agrees to testify, etc.
freddoso	715339914833842176	2016-03-31T00:48:20	drcme But the question is, what happened in the plain vanilla pre-Roe case where someone went to an illegal abortionist
freddoso	715339757975306240	2016-03-31T00:47:43	drcme The test used to convince the jury is supposedly unreliable, or so goes the argument.
freddoso	715339588387020801	2016-03-31T00:47:02	drcme In the Patel case, for example, her appeal will rest on a question of fact -- whether she gave birth to a live child &amp; left it to die
freddoso	715338719692066817	2016-03-31T00:43:35	drcme In any event, I don't think these examples are the right ones to illustrate the issue of prosecuting women for having abortions.
freddoso	715338473763307520	2016-03-31T00:42:37	EsotericCD Surely this is a troll....?
freddoso	715338088638078978	2016-03-31T00:41:05	drcme I agree there needs to be more of that.
freddoso	715337444644638721	2016-03-31T00:38:31	drcme But this is an axiom you're stating, not something this case demonstrates.
freddoso	715337291619667968	2016-03-31T00:37:55	drcme Much like the assumption that legalizing abortion stops people from doing it.
freddoso	715336944314548224	2016-03-31T00:36:32	drcme It's almost as if that assumption about why people do this sort of thing is wrong.
freddoso	715336735450771457	2016-03-31T00:35:42	drcme How does that apply in this case? It happened in a place and time where there were no restrictions.
freddoso	715329135283822592	2016-03-31T00:05:30	CorporateGoatee ha!
freddoso	715306601976958976	2016-03-30T22:35:58	drcme Reading further, it appears the jury found she had given birth to a live baby. Perhaps wrongly, but seems to be why they convicted.
freddoso	715305534493032448	2016-03-30T22:31:43	drcme Moreover, even if this case is an outlier, I don't think it's constructive to oppose all role of laws in banning self-surgery.
freddoso	715305244482113536	2016-03-30T22:30:34	drcme TimAlberta But legal abortion is specifically exempted from the law she was convicted under.
freddoso	715304790457081856	2016-03-30T22:28:46	drcme TimAlberta alivitali 20-yr sentence in IN case seems absurd to me. Probably should have given her psych help instead.
freddoso	715302707150499841	2016-03-30T22:20:29	drcme TimAlberta alivitali Merits of the prosecutions aside, Illegal abortions--which legal abortion was supposed to end--remain illegal.

freddoso	714457961007939585	2016-03-28T14:23:46	takethepith They figured out 30 years later what Johnson had done, and abruptly changed their voting patterns. 
freddoso	714456309345570816	2016-03-28T14:17:12	takethepith No, I think many of them kept voting for Dems until they died off &amp; those states  finally stopped electing Dems in '94-'14
freddoso	714455884047384580	2016-03-28T14:15:31	takethepith Based on that it seems like the important shift must happened long before 1936.
freddoso	714454798381125633	2016-03-28T14:11:12	takethepith It was 74% before the civil rights era, according to the chart you sent.
freddoso	714454301448359936	2016-03-28T14:09:14	takethepith Once they were no longer able to use the state as a tool to oppress blacks, there was no reason to keep voting Dem.
freddoso	714454162717560832	2016-03-28T14:08:40	takethepith I mean, you realize those old Dixiecrats, even the handful that switched to GOP, were not fiscal conservatives or anything.
freddoso	714453969729236992	2016-03-28T14:07:54	takethepith Yes, but you're exaggerating one change, when the more important one wasn't even just something that happened in the South.
freddoso	714453776694792195	2016-03-28T14:07:08	takethepith Once the south stopped voting on race, it gradually started voting on other issues
freddoso	714453490769080321	2016-03-28T14:06:00	takethepith And you're ignoring it because it doesn't fit with a worldview you're invested in preserving.
freddoso	714453415837835264	2016-03-28T14:05:42	takethepith You are ignoring. The South kept voting Dem for more than a generation. And often for liberals, just because they were Dems.
freddoso	714451805543858176	2016-03-28T13:59:18	takethepith This ignores a lot of important data points to preserve a theory that makes you feel good about yourself.
freddoso	714318659741548545	2016-03-28T05:10:14	takethepith No, people voted Wallace because they were racists. But the fact that they voted Wallace is significant, isn't it?
freddoso	714318356409528320	2016-03-28T05:09:02	senorawesomeguy KurtSchlichter The difference between losing with or without dignity is significant for Congress.

freddoso	714310865739063297	2016-03-28T04:39:16	takethepith Which is consistent w the fact that only this decade you still have legislatures going R for the 1st time since Reconstruction.
freddoso	714310582292189184	2016-03-28T04:38:08	takethepith The more plausible explanation is that once oppressing blacks was off the table people voted on other issues.
freddoso	714310378029600769	2016-03-28T04:37:20	takethepith Southerners and esp. election officials were definitely cheating racists, doesn't mean it explains D loss of power in late 20th
freddoso	714309208024330240	2016-03-28T04:32:41	takethepith need to compare how voters varied from the mean, not just the totals.
freddoso	714309104949276672	2016-03-28T04:32:16	takethepith 72 was a national landslide, kind of weird to use that as the benchmark.
freddoso	714308847259615232	2016-03-28T04:31:15	takethepith I'm not defending the South. But the idea that Dems lost their grip bc of that &amp; not social issues is self-serving.
freddoso	714308598235422720	2016-03-28T04:30:15	takethepith Also need to study South between 1900 and 1956, as seantrende did in detail. Growing (losing) minority of voters throughout
freddoso	714308175646732289	2016-03-28T04:28:34	KurtSchlichter Well, yes, but this is assuming that goes by the wayside.
freddoso	714307902404579328	2016-03-28T04:27:29	NextGenUSA360 There aren't enough neocons to form a party. It's going to be something more libertarian.
freddoso	714307359451971584	2016-03-28T04:25:20	takethepith The South didn't even feel comfortable voting Republican until the 1990s, some states until this decade.
freddoso	714307182527799296	2016-03-28T04:24:38	takethepith Ok, then look at '68, '72, '76 and '80. Reagan didn't even get majorities in most of those states. And look at SEN, REP, GOV

freddoso	714306262737891329	2016-03-28T04:20:58	NextGenUSA360 We'll have to see what happens first. Trump is challenging the idea that the parties are ideological at all.
freddoso	714305897590161408	2016-03-28T04:19:31	takethepith This false conceit falls apart when you look at how the South continued to vote Dem for the next 30 years.
freddoso	714305749191499776	2016-03-28T04:18:56	james_mainevent So were the Nixon/Reagan voting Dems whose party had left them, I imagine.

freddoso	714304545715650560	2016-03-28T04:14:09	NextGenUSA360 No, they had to re-form it after losing 5 of 7. And they did.
freddoso	714304133101060096	2016-03-28T04:12:31	Except that in this case, they retain some vague hope they can keep or get their party back someday. Who knows?
freddoso	714303847884132352	2016-03-28T04:11:23	I think it's fair to compare people who are genuinely nevertrump to ethnic Dems whose party left them w "acid, amnesty, abortion" long ago.
