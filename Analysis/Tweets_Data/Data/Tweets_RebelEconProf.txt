RebelEconProf	723485650595536896	2016-04-22T12:16:35	squarelyrooted Where did he *advocate* that position? Seems like he's describing why Rs in general won't support it.

RebelEconProf	722421318549905409	2016-04-19T13:47:18	salimfurth Bank capital is an equilibrium outcome. All else equal all banks would be safer with more capital. That's an accounting argument
RebelEconProf	722420828151918592	2016-04-19T13:45:22	salimfurth No. People say hold more capital. That's a stupid phrase, but it's the common phrasing.
RebelEconProf	722419221163089921	2016-04-19T13:38:58	We don't want banks to hold more capital. We want banks to want to hold more capital. This requires restructuring incentives.
RebelEconProf	722419000857247744	2016-04-19T13:38:06	There's a difference between accounting &amp; economics. Unfortunately discussions about capital requirements often don't address the difference
RebelEconProf	722418696505974784	2016-04-19T13:36:53	Ceteris paribus, a bank with more capital is a safer bank. That's not necessarily an argument for capital reqs

RebelEconProf	720619994841747456	2016-04-14T14:29:29	david_glasner Ceteris park is, sterilizing gold inflows causes a reduction in world money supply when only relative supplies should change
RebelEconProf	720619570893959168	2016-04-14T14:27:48	david_glasner That's not the point I'm making. What I'm saying is that sterilizing gold inflows can create deflation in rest of the world.
RebelEconProf	720619026683203585	2016-04-14T14:25:39	david_glasner This isn't problematic if relative supplies of currency adjust. But if eg France doesn't increase money supply, then it is.
RebelEconProf	720618704858439680	2016-04-14T14:24:22	david_glasner People sell dollars for gold and then sell gold for francs. So gold flows from US to France...

RebelEconProf	720613919312764928	2016-04-14T14:05:21	Since Friedman=advocate of free markets, ppl seem to conflate monetarism w/conservatism. You can believe this or you can read the literature
RebelEconProf	720612857243660289	2016-04-14T14:01:08	Old Monetarism wasn't just some crude version of the quantity theory. If you want to understand it, read Ed Nelson: 
RebelEconProf	720445586844053505	2016-04-14T02:56:27	david_glasner However, if a country prevents Δ in domestic price level, relative price levels must Δ thereby forcing adjustment on others.
RebelEconProf	720444812730769408	2016-04-14T02:53:23	david_glasner IOW if all countries return to gold std &amp; chosen exchange rates are "wrong" many combinations of price level Δ's are possible
RebelEconProf	720444207647825920	2016-04-14T02:50:58	david_glasner Right but overvaluation in one country requires deflation in that country if all other currencies are properly valued, no?
RebelEconProf	720440078791745537	2016-04-14T02:34:34	david_glasner Or are you saying that these improper valuations had nothing to do with a desire to return to parity?
RebelEconProf	720439905298489346	2016-04-14T02:33:53	david_glasner But French prevented necessary correction by sterilizing gold inflows. Are you saying this occurred much later? ...
RebelEconProf	720438410821955584	2016-04-14T02:27:56	david_glasner My understanding is that exchange rates were "wrong" in the sense that some currencies were overvalued, some undervalued...
RebelEconProf	720370452959330304	2016-04-13T21:57:54	DavidBeckworth Without promise to return to parity, price level rises in proportion with money supply.
RebelEconProf	720370252211687424	2016-04-13T21:57:06	DavidBeckworth IOW, suspension of gold std and promise to return to parity increases real money balances and govt gets more seigniorage.

RebelEconProf	720367056407916544	2016-04-13T21:44:24	david_glasner But as you know Earl Thompson argued restoring parity was crucial for war finance. Do you have an opinion on this?
RebelEconProf	720366601493733377	2016-04-13T21:42:36	david_glasner This is a great post. One question. Many see attempt to restore pre-WWI parity as setting the stage for what came later ...
RebelEconProf	719520723555852288	2016-04-11T13:41:23	The more I read Thompson, the more I find his work fascinating. Truly independent thinker with a unique style.

RebelEconProf	718885630319726592	2016-04-09T19:37:45	BrianCAlbrecht For Brunner -&gt;money. Alchian -&gt;transaction costs. Hirshleifer-&gt;exchange, then non-mkt interactions. Thompson -&gt;institutions
RebelEconProf	718884896064872449	2016-04-09T19:34:50	BrianCAlbrecht I think core theme of UCLA school was about taking neoclassical model and asking what could be learned from what's missing.
RebelEconProf	718883423000125442	2016-04-09T19:28:58	BrianCAlbrecht But a lot of what was interesting about Alchian's search paper has been sacrificed to a matching function.
RebelEconProf	718883177104805889	2016-04-09T19:28:00	BrianCAlbrecht Many would argue that those working in labor search are following Alchian (and others).
RebelEconProf	718882512576110592	2016-04-09T19:25:21	BrianCAlbrecht Sadly, it seems Earl Thompson has had very little impact, despite the fact that his work on institutions is fascinating.
RebelEconProf	718882232346263553	2016-04-09T19:24:15	BrianCAlbrecht Hirshleifer extended Fisher to formal neoclassical model. Hirshleifer is actually @ core of macro.Most don't know/realize it
RebelEconProf	718881517099970561	2016-04-09T19:21:24	BrianCAlbrecht I can only really speak about macro. I think PIrelandatBC and Mike Belongia and Ed Nelson are in the Brunner tradition.
RebelEconProf	718881024982323200	2016-04-09T19:19:27	BrianCAlbrecht Also distinct from each other. Alchian, Hirshleifer, Brunner, &amp; Thompson worked on macro topics, but very different styles
RebelEconProf	718880077623259137	2016-04-09T19:15:41	BrianCAlbrecht They also had a unique style. They often pushed mathematics to the appendix (eg Alchian's contribution to Phelps volume)
RebelEconProf	718879373949018113	2016-04-09T19:12:53	BrianCAlbrecht They approached important topics in new ways and from completely different perspectives from their contemporaries.
RebelEconProf	718878895009886208	2016-04-09T19:10:59	BrianCAlbrecht That's a hard question because one thing that made UCLA great was their unique thinking.
RebelEconProf	718858481328070656	2016-04-09T17:49:52	BrianCAlbrecht I want to see a 2nd coming of the entire "UCLA school." Alchian, Hirshleifer, Brunner, Thompson, etc. All unique. All great.

RebelEconProf	715642824117653504	2016-03-31T20:51:59	MacRoweNick I'm not sure is this would be correct in a search model. Worker &amp; firm are matched. Wage is determined by bilateral negotiation
RebelEconProf	715640790492569602	2016-03-31T20:43:55	If correct, this could explain small disemployment effects w/higher minimum wages. Firms are willing to pay more, but have info advantage
RebelEconProf	715640041901592577	2016-03-31T20:40:56	Workers know it is hard to negotiate higher wages individually or through unions &amp; therefore try to negotiate through the political process.
RebelEconProf	715639179644903424	2016-03-31T20:37:31	salimfurth Precisely. But very little in between.
RebelEconProf	715638966205210624	2016-03-31T20:36:40	I wonder if declining unionization, but information disadvantage &amp; high transaction costs explain increased calls for a higher min wage
RebelEconProf	715638004623212545	2016-03-31T20:32:50	The existence of unions seems to support the idea of informational advantage AND high transaction costs because they negotiate for the group
RebelEconProf	715637102042607616	2016-03-31T20:29:15	But we don't generally see private firms as middlemen in labor markets, which suggests that the transactions costs are too high.
RebelEconProf	715636579679805441	2016-03-31T20:27:11	Typically you would expect a middleman to emerge to negotiate wages on behalf of the party with less information and take a percentage.
RebelEconProf	715635601270259712	2016-03-31T20:23:17	This seems to be a problem in labor markets. Firms hire workers more frequently than workers sell their services &amp; have an info advantage
RebelEconProf	715634991284240384	2016-03-31T20:20:52	Thus, you might agree to a price above your reservation price &amp; later regret your decision once you find out you could gotten a higher price
RebelEconProf	715634633011044352	2016-03-31T20:19:27	Suppose you sell a good infrequently. When you bring the good to market, people who buy the good frequently have an informational advantage.

RebelEconProf	699248297517707264	2016-02-15T15:06:00	SapientCapital Well, we will never get the counterfactual. Question is whether first mover knows this is optimal or thinks this is optimal.
RebelEconProf	699247762785898497	2016-02-15T15:03:52	SapientCapital Exactly. The Republicans moved first. The Democrats subgame perfect move in a typical game is exactly what they're doing.
RebelEconProf	699247358245277696	2016-02-15T15:02:16	Regardless, discussion of who is doing the "right" thing should include an attempt to understand the underlying decision tree of the game.
RebelEconProf	699246140827561988	2016-02-15T14:57:25	This one could imagine second mover advantage of waiting, seeming more reasonable, scoring political points, and getting compromise nominee
RebelEconProf	699245661351497729	2016-02-15T14:55:31	However the game might be more complex since the payoffs should be a function of both outcome and political point scoring.

RebelEconProf	698238530468847617	2016-02-12T20:13:32	This is a pretty amazing headline. 
RebelEconProf	698179853074440192	2016-02-12T16:20:23	HPublius This idea originated with Fisher Black. Here is the original paper: 
RebelEconProf	698159291409293313	2016-02-12T14:58:40	t0nyyates kocherlakota009 More QE. The relevant market interest rate at the ZLB isn't 0. It's the shadow rate. 
RebelEconProf	698159025486241792	2016-02-12T14:57:37	kocherlakota009 nick_bunker So the point is that infrastructure might not be as much of a free lunch as we often think when rates are low.
RebelEconProf	698158865783853056	2016-02-12T14:56:59	kocherlakota009 nick_bunker Right. Paper doesn't say we shouldn't ⬆️ invest in infrastructure, just that to consider relevant trade offs.
RebelEconProf	698158083214860289	2016-02-12T14:53:52	kocherlakota009 nick_bunker So my contention is not that you're wrong, but rather I fear it gives central bankers cover for not doing more
RebelEconProf	698157924942745600	2016-02-12T14:53:15	kocherlakota009 nick_bunker Right. We are in agreement that we need expansionary policy. I just want to hold FOMC's feet to the fire.
RebelEconProf	698157145880137732	2016-02-12T14:50:09	kocherlakota009 nick_bunker Its not just that possibility. There is also an opportunity cost to replacing infrastructure too soon.
RebelEconProf	698154556488810503	2016-02-12T14:39:52	kocherlakota009 nick_bunker 1 last point. Political econ of govt spending=important. Harder to pass legislation than do another rd of QE.
RebelEconProf	698153290287214592	2016-02-12T14:34:50	kocherlakota009 nick_bunker Also, it's not clear that NPV is the correct criteria for infrastructure investment: 
RebelEconProf	698153153049583616	2016-02-12T14:34:17	kocherlakota009 nick_bunker I'm not arguing govt *can't* raise rstar. My point is we shouldn't give a free pass to monetary policymakers.
RebelEconProf	698149159983951873	2016-02-12T14:18:25	nick_bunker kocherlakota009 Only if you think the ZLB is binding and there's reason to think its not: 
RebelEconProf	698132186638196736	2016-02-12T13:10:58	DavidBeckworth Shadow rate is relevant market rate at ZLB. If CB can push shadow rate down to/below nat rate, don't need neg. policy rate.
RebelEconProf	698130291559395332	2016-02-12T13:03:26	DavidBeckworth But are negative rates necessary? QE significantly reduced the shadow rate in the US. 
RebelEconProf	698000689826504704	2016-02-12T04:28:27	DavidBeckworth So it's not surprising there are so many conflicting views about what rates are saying.
RebelEconProf	698000428697571329	2016-02-12T04:27:25	DavidBeckworth Nominal interest rate is a function of expected growth, time preference, expected inflation, risk &amp; liquidity premia.

RebelEconProf	686743824241192960	2016-01-12T02:57:41	DavidBeckworth Same.
RebelEconProf	686579647975403520	2016-01-11T16:05:18	BrianCAlbrecht What do you think of global games?
RebelEconProf	686578867620982784	2016-01-11T16:02:12	BourbonGhost There's no argument. Promised Land is the best and everyone else is wrong.
RebelEconProf	686534389505855488	2016-01-11T13:05:28	UpdatedPriors And I fear that focus on Phillips Curve (even as a pedagogical device) doesn't sell the argument to those who use real models
RebelEconProf	686533954976006144	2016-01-11T13:03:44	UpdatedPriors In other words, I think it's well known that introducing non-neutralities greatly change implications.
RebelEconProf	686531108108898305	2016-01-11T12:52:25	UpdatedPriors I'll give it a read, but it basically sounds like a re-hash of the NK model.
RebelEconProf	686258725418438656	2016-01-10T18:50:04	Here to see OleMissWBB put up 💯

RebelEconProf	685458480040378368	2016-01-08T13:50:11	Monthly reminder that there's no such thing as a Phillips Curve and that job and wage growth don't create "inflationary pressure."
RebelEconProf	685160237033197568	2016-01-07T18:05:04	Noahpinion Their lack of the same tools we have doesn't make them less serious or less concerned with the real world. Maybe you disagree
RebelEconProf	685159901631479808	2016-01-07T18:03:44	Noahpinion Sorry. I guess what I'm saying is when I read Tobin or Alchian, I see them seriously trying to wrestle with "stylized facts"
RebelEconProf	685158887398453248	2016-01-07T17:59:43	Noahpinion PPA_Day When I read purely empirical micro papers I don't see diffuse priors.I see a null based on well understood micro theory
RebelEconProf	685158120419667969	2016-01-07T17:56:40	Noahpinion PPA_Day So your definition of seriousness is tautological? (Not trying to be difficult. I just don't get what you're saying.)
RebelEconProf	685157582533713920	2016-01-07T17:54:31	PPA_Day Noahpinion I honestly don't know what this means. It seems to define seriousness as a function of tools.
RebelEconProf	685155333812170752	2016-01-07T17:45:35	Noahpinion BrianCAlbrecht So do you think that economists 20-30 yrs ago were less serious/concerned with real world?
RebelEconProf	685130501196218368	2016-01-07T16:06:55	BrianCAlbrecht This is why we still see more theory in macro. Most macro data is awful. Also why people are using more micro data in macro.
RebelEconProf	685130035376828416	2016-01-07T16:05:04	BrianCAlbrecht But for some reason, outsiders want to paint it as a trend toward "realism" and "seriousness", etc.
RebelEconProf	685129730132164609	2016-01-07T16:03:51	BrianCAlbrecht To me, the trend toward empirics seems to be about increase in amount of data and increased computer speeds.
RebelEconProf	685129514809200640	2016-01-07T16:03:00	BrianCAlbrecht But that piece seems to think that theory is just navel-gazing. What are empirical people testing without theory?
RebelEconProf	685127107610062848	2016-01-07T15:53:26	BrianCAlbrecht Theory versus empirics is a false dichotomy.

RebelEconProf	684818675526840320	2016-01-06T19:27:50	It's 2016 and I'm still writing "really? You will only take a check?" on my checks.
RebelEconProf	684806990883864576	2016-01-06T18:41:24	M_C_Klein dandolfa HyunSongShin Hyun,like Burns, is arguing that central banks can't move inflation like they used to - Burns was wrong.
RebelEconProf	684741879871762432	2016-01-06T14:22:40	jimtankersley Also it'd be interesting to see what this looked like after taxes and transfers.
RebelEconProf	684741113224237056	2016-01-06T14:19:37	jimtankersley If these are individuals, income growth of 0.7% might understate household income growth as female LFP dramatically increased
RebelEconProf	684740680606990336	2016-01-06T14:17:54	jimtankersley One reason I ask is that vertical line drawn in 1980 seems arbitrary. One could've drawn same line in 1972 w/roughly same avg
RebelEconProf	684740269732970498	2016-01-06T14:16:16	jimtankersley Is this based on individual taxpayer or household? Changing composition of work within household &amp; of household itself matter
RebelEconProf	684438470543028226	2016-01-05T18:17:02	dandolfa boromiya Will the characters be recorded on the blockchain?
RebelEconProf	683423673533911040	2016-01-02T23:04:35	BourbonGhost So you've gone to the dark side? (I'll show myself out.)
RebelEconProf	682421598268317696	2015-12-31T04:42:42	stuartpstevens Assumed this was about Corbyn until the last sentence.
RebelEconProf	682402049036791810	2015-12-31T03:25:01	BasilHalperin To me, M is important to understand IOER. Post was to show role of M &amp; that it's not some odd ratex sol that generates result
RebelEconProf	682400376818151424	2015-12-31T03:18:22	BasilHalperin My intuition is that IOER is contractionary because interest elasticity of currency is small.
