AmbroseEP	708693780132732928	2016-03-12T16:38:58	DamCou I that is a reasonable argument, but post-Iraq, there was no willingness of US /UK public to carry the burden, or trust in mission.

AmbroseEP	708688759722786816	2016-03-12T16:19:01	DamCou Allied intervention against Assad or against ISIS. I have no idea what your view is.

AmbroseEP	708679803772280832	2016-03-12T15:43:26	DamCou As for where we stand now. The West is effectively allied with Assad against ISIS, so entire picture has changed
AmbroseEP	708679611815759873	2016-03-12T15:42:40	DamCou My view, enforcing red-line would have been futile, achieved nothing, and unjustifiable after CIA told him Chem/Wep intel unreliable
AmbroseEP	708678867775524864	2016-03-12T15:39:43	allanholloway TheAtlantic two things happened. CIA told him intel was dodgy, and UK Parliament voted down action. Obama right to rethink
