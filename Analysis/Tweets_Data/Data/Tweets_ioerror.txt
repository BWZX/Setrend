ioerror	684906950056804352	2016-01-07T01:18:36	brynosaurus I think in parallel we need to find ways to replace the DA property of uniform network consensus document.
ioerror	684906786415968257	2016-01-07T01:17:57	brynosaurus I think we can reduce the current authority with role splitting, which we know how to do now.

ioerror	684906373788794880	2016-01-07T01:16:19	brynosaurus Yes, I think so - need to think about cMix a bit more but seems intuitively so.
ioerror	684906228539998208	2016-01-07T01:15:44	brynosaurus Then, we need to make it so that DAs aren't worse than all other options - which is true for other systems.
ioerror	684906092803919872	2016-01-07T01:15:12	brynosaurus I'd like to do that for Tor as well - first we need to split roles even further (eg: DAs hidden, keys offline, etc)
ioerror	684905107419455489	2016-01-07T01:11:17	octal Don't steal the dude's rug, man.
ioerror	684904337869549568	2016-01-07T01:08:13	I hope Chaum and nickm_tor meet to discuss tor and cMix at realworldcrypto.
ioerror	684904056775663617	2016-01-07T01:07:06	brynosaurus I wonder if cMix will live long enough for us to need it. But hey, perhaps we have a good first collaboration here. :)
ioerror	684903937389019137	2016-01-07T01:06:38	RealWorldCrypto Ask hashbreaker and hyperelliptic if we can host in Eindhoven - I will help on the ground, if they agree.
ioerror	684903631821389825	2016-01-07T01:05:25	brynosaurus Ah, sure - though interestingly, I think we still have a functional network and anyone on the real network is forward secret?
ioerror	684903179583131650	2016-01-07T01:03:37	brynosaurus Of course, I know - my observation is that possible collusion is different in kind, as well as degree.
ioerror	684902767383719936	2016-01-07T01:01:59	brynosaurus There are other differences - I think we could write up Tor vs cMix as a nice paper of what to do vs what not to do? Unsure.
ioerror	684902120806551552	2016-01-07T00:59:25	Brian_Sniffen And worse: they think they understand all the rules for all the players - FBI knows this is a lie, Chaum might not.
ioerror	684901840614469632	2016-01-07T00:58:18	octal Not the UK - Eindhoven or Berlin would both be awesome and possible.

ioerror	684900644797427712	2016-01-07T00:53:33	brynosaurus All the DAs in the world can't collude to decrypt yesterday's traffic though - which is the key (ha) difference.
ioerror	684900414727286784	2016-01-07T00:52:38	nikitab Cool, does he know anyone who can design secure anonymity networks too?
ioerror	684899552437137409	2016-01-07T00:49:12	Could someone attending realworldcrypto please show Chaum how easy it is to compromise a computer? Might help for future designs.
ioerror	684899097275400192	2016-01-07T00:47:24	I wish I could attend realworldcrypto, I hope next year is in Berlin.
ioerror	684898927838126080	2016-01-07T00:46:43	brynosaurus Also, guards, yes. Basically, we have two main states: bootstrapped and not bootstrapped - attack looks different for both
ioerror	684898759571062785	2016-01-07T00:46:03	brynosaurus Given 5 DA keys, an attacker could produce a bad consensus and feed it to alice at some point eg ~25hrs after good consensus

ioerror	684824034534555648	2016-01-06T19:49:07	brynosaurus I think that the main difference here is about key agreement as well as nodes for routing. Chaum proposes merging them, no?
ioerror	684822990928793600	2016-01-06T19:44:59	brynosaurus That would only produce a "bad" consensus - in the future, we will make it impossible to do non-transparently with CT.
ioerror	684822872943009792	2016-01-06T19:44:30	brynosaurus There is a difference between the consensus document and key agreement. Also, hard to hide that it happened.

ioerror	684765328602198017	2016-01-06T15:55:51	Any reasonable actor will bounce through other systems to PrivaTegrity and defeat their escrow anyway. Irony: use Chaum's home computer.
