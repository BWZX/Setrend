PeterBeinart	705814978402586624	2016-03-04T17:59:38	It's time for the US to take a tougher stand on settlements.  
PeterBeinart	705782956460265474	2016-03-04T15:52:24	Just like Rubio did! If he can do it on national television, you can do it in front of a mirror. 
PeterBeinart	705804861569429504	2016-03-04T17:19:26	Also, impressively, Trump’s campaign manages to misspell both Wichita AND Kansas. 
PeterBeinart	705812543797907456	2016-03-04T17:49:58	I pray that PeterBeinart is wrong. But after seeing GOPDebate bloodthirsty audience, I'm terrified that he's not.  
PeterBeinart	705604415361835009	2016-03-04T04:02:56	I want to say that Trump was wounded tonight but literally every other time I've thought that I've been wrong

PeterBeinart	705604187615338496	2016-03-04T04:02:02	Tonights winner was Donald Trump, by inches.
PeterBeinart	705603855451561984	2016-03-04T04:00:43	Marco Rubio said this today about the man who he just now said he'd support for president GOPDebate 
PeterBeinart	705603871243161600	2016-03-04T04:00:47	wait ... doesn't NeverTrump mean ... like....never Trump? 
PeterBeinart	705581134394978304	2016-03-04T02:30:26	Thank you Republican voters for wholeheartedly rejecting this Kasich guy, he would have been hard to beat
PeterBeinart	705593131207671808	2016-03-04T03:18:06	I bet Trump is totally kicking everyone's ass in the new TrumpUniversity poll.
PeterBeinart	705603166478450688	2016-03-04T03:57:59	The question that once seemed like a trap for Trump -- will you support the nominee -- now seems like a trap for everyone else.
PeterBeinart	705602012411469824	2016-03-04T03:53:23	Cruz consistently gets the history of Clinton's dealings with North Korea wrong. 
PeterBeinart	705602019134930944	2016-03-04T03:53:25	"Egypt is on its last legs." That passes for intelligent FP commentary. A-mazing.

PeterBeinart	705601710530539521	2016-03-04T03:52:11	Anyone who wants to learn about the whys of 20th century urban decay should start with TomSugrue book. Anything else secondary.
PeterBeinart	705601624337686528	2016-03-04T03:51:51	Oh God this Kasich trip around the world is painful.
PeterBeinart	705601627017732096	2016-03-04T03:51:51	Kasich’s proposal to unilaterally extend Article V guarantees to Finland seems like an idea worth debating. I see risk and merit.
PeterBeinart	705601603081019393	2016-03-04T03:51:46	The Egyptian may be on their last legs, but it’s because of the economy, not because of attacks from ISIS in the Sinai.
PeterBeinart	705596551058423808	2016-03-04T03:31:41	Amazed by Rubio's Flint answer. No crisis caused by deregulation or abdication can be GOP's fault, cuz, hey, we were trying not to be there.

PeterBeinart	705598577033256961	2016-03-04T03:39:44	Cruz was a pretty big fan of Roberts  
PeterBeinart	705598803622035456	2016-03-04T03:40:38	I am no TomSugrue but anyone who boils Detroit deindustrialization down to partisanship knows nothing. 
PeterBeinart	705598198161739776	2016-03-04T03:38:14	Our world may be more at risk from climate change than from anything else--and it doesn't even come up in the debate.
PeterBeinart	705596057233784832	2016-03-04T03:29:44	5 minutes after Flint discussion, Ted Cruz says he'll pull back EPA regulators to help business.
PeterBeinart	705595730073919488	2016-03-04T03:28:26	If Rubio was a factor at all anymore, that Flint answer would rightfully dog him for days.
PeterBeinart	705592740432781312	2016-03-04T03:16:33	I think tedcruz is huge beneficiary tonight thus far.
PeterBeinart	705597595956199428	2016-03-04T03:35:50	Rubio's travel schedule catching up with him. Looks and sounds tired.
PeterBeinart	705597418402942976	2016-03-04T03:35:08	I wish a moderator would ask about a Muslim cab driver refusing to transport a passenger carrying alcohol. 
PeterBeinart	705597526162935808	2016-03-04T03:35:34	this debate is a disaster for marcorubio. Being outperformed by both tedcruz + JohnKasich. No longer looks like alternative gopdebate

PeterBeinart	705596943200821248	2016-03-04T03:33:15	to be clear. for these candidates, "religious liberty" means "religious liberty for right-wing Christians." Doesn't apply to Muslims
PeterBeinart	705596677080653824	2016-03-04T03:32:11	another GOP debate where big "religious liberty" problem is cupcakes for gays not banning every muslim from entering US gopdebate

PeterBeinart	705595712017448960	2016-03-04T03:28:21	Right. As long as no one literally poured lead tainted water down a child's throat, no harm no foul. 
PeterBeinart	705595751213244416	2016-03-04T03:28:31	Ted Cruz stirring TomSugrue from his slumber: "Detroit has suffered from 60 years of left wing policies."
PeterBeinart	705595804199862272	2016-03-04T03:28:43	60 years of failed left-wing policy are what decimated Detroit? Does that include GOP governors, Senators, and presidents?
PeterBeinart	705595806703882242	2016-03-04T03:28:44	I’ll be honest, favorably referencing Henry Ford isn’t all that different than playing footsie with David Duke.
PeterBeinart	705595642731597825	2016-03-04T03:28:05	PeterBeinart jonathanchait and wholly offensive. State law stripped local control from flint and DPS. Depraved indifference.
PeterBeinart	705595545168027649	2016-03-04T03:27:41	Headline in NYT today: "Flint Is in the News, but Lead Poisoning Is Even Worse in Cleveland" cc: John Kasich.
PeterBeinart	705594951422246912	2016-03-04T03:25:20	Kasich incorrectly asserts that the Mayor controls the schools in Detroit.  It's the Gov.
PeterBeinart	705594874792321024	2016-03-04T03:25:02	It’s unfair to “politicize” Flint, oh well it’s good to know that some things, like the GOP’s denial of systematic racism, don’t change,
PeterBeinart	705595172072120320	2016-03-04T03:26:13	jonathanchait deeply pathetic answer
PeterBeinart	705594730147659777	2016-03-04T03:24:27	Rubio: "Politicizing" Flint water is "unfair" because Republicans wouldn't wake up and decide to poison children.
PeterBeinart	705594934636756993	2016-03-04T03:25:16	Rubio is clueless. Governor Synder had ample time to address the FlintWaterCrisis and failed. You like to drink water right? Go to Flint!

PeterBeinart	705592435263598592	2016-03-04T03:15:20	So far I’d rank them: Cruz, Kasich, Rubio/Trump.
PeterBeinart	705592476409716736	2016-03-04T03:15:30	Cruz is very good at moving back and forth between tag-teaming with Marco against Trump then suddenly rising above both.
