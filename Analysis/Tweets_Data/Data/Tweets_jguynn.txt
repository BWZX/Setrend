jguynn	725071819011665921	2016-04-26T21:19:27	TWTR shares hit $15.48, down 13%.
jguynn	725071164570116096	2016-04-26T21:16:51	Twitter's revenue hurt by weak brand biz, video ad $ coming "largely" from $ already spent on Twitter 
jguynn	725071357457883138	2016-04-26T21:17:37	TWTR shares continue to sink as Twitter execs talk.

jguynn	684434666628100096	2016-01-05T18:01:55	Twitter is a place for public self-expression, searchable and embeddable on the web, from people I'm interested in—not just people I know.
