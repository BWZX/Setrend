ChartSwingTrade	722462395218673668	2016-04-19T16:30:32	Seeing quite a bit of ugliness out there besides NFLX.  Also see TSLA, SQ, NK, PYPL.  Maybe it's just my list.
ChartSwingTrade	720298093472645120	2016-04-13T17:10:22	For as strong as market is today, the two names I've been in (NFLX and PYPL) are really fading here.  Figures.
ChartSwingTrade	710932948170743810	2016-03-18T20:56:37	From standpoint that they probably should have been a #1 seed and lots were picking them to win it all, this is likely biggest upset ever.
ChartSwingTrade	704646287162019840	2016-03-01T12:35:41	Tough market right now.  It's been a grind on the way up so longs have been difficult but short signals like yesterday aren't working either
ChartSwingTrade	704485272742981632	2016-03-01T01:55:52	If you're baseball fan, the new series on smithsonian channel "Major League Legends" is very well done.  Never knew all Hank Aaron went thru
ChartSwingTrade	704410891371020288	2016-02-29T21:00:18	Can't borrow TSLA to short on Thinkorswim.  Crap.
ChartSwingTrade	703801391538503682	2016-02-28T04:38:22	Safe to say Stephen Curry goes down as best NBA player ever under 6'5"??? Absolutely ridiculous.  I don't believe what I just watched.
ChartSwingTrade	702938797047021568	2016-02-25T19:30:43	Got stopped on TSLA this morning from yesterday.  yikes
ChartSwingTrade	702594202744582145	2016-02-24T20:41:26	Had AMZN earlier at $538 but got stopped at $535.  Would have been nice.  Did get  some TSLA and DUST around $4.13.
ChartSwingTrade	700789195875315712	2016-02-19T21:08:58	Only problem is that I still don't see anything in terms of interesting individual stocks setting up or acting like leaders. Could take time
ChartSwingTrade	700788594084982785	2016-02-19T21:06:35	Today's action confirmed that thought.  Indexes look quite bullish on the daily charts although a little back and fill wouldn't be bad.
ChartSwingTrade	700788340908371968	2016-02-19T21:05:35	Made some money shorting AMZN yesterday (and early today) but thought y-day's action was actually bullish.  Very extended yet only small PB
ChartSwingTrade	699626515143593984	2016-02-16T16:08:54	Market just sucks right now. Total chop intraday on most days.   Scalpers delight perhaps but anything more than an hour or so is tough.
ChartSwingTrade	696535843838697473	2016-02-08T03:27:40	Congrats Peyton.  You can't possibly be stupid enough to NOT walk into the sunset after this.
ChartSwingTrade	696533841394036736	2016-02-08T03:19:43	An interesting historical match up would be this Broncos team vs first Ravens Super Bowl team.  Very very similar.
ChartSwingTrade	696530760476438528	2016-02-08T03:07:28	Complete "blah" from the level of play, commercials, halftime show.   Maybe I'm just getting old.
ChartSwingTrade	696530534118219777	2016-02-08T03:06:34	Worst played, most boring non-blowout Super Bowl that I can remember in a long while.   Won't even get a tension-filled ending.
ChartSwingTrade	696528506314883072	2016-02-08T02:58:31	I just hope Peyton doesn't throw a pick six to lose the game.  It might be fitting but would still be awful.
ChartSwingTrade	696528197723119616	2016-02-08T02:57:17	7 minutes left.   With denver's offense, Cam should get at least two more chances to be the hero and lead a TD winning drive.
ChartSwingTrade	696501591164059650	2016-02-08T01:11:34	This has been a poorly played first half.   Penalties, turnovers, drops.  Hopefully second half is better.
ChartSwingTrade	696485707796250624	2016-02-08T00:08:27	I am rooting for Peyton but that was a terrible call.   Ball never ever hit the ground.  Should have been catch.  Is the fix in?
ChartSwingTrade	693121284935401476	2016-01-29T17:19:26	Hopefully this one is for real.   Would love to see a real squeeze here into the weekend.
ChartSwingTrade	693111248603340801	2016-01-29T16:39:33	And of course as I soon as I type that, TNA breaks down.   We'll, back to the sideline I guess.   Still just too choppy.
ChartSwingTrade	693110627909259265	2016-01-29T16:37:05	So far more of a coiling pattern than a fade which is good.   Needs to hold up obviously.
ChartSwingTrade	693100534526578688	2016-01-29T15:56:59	Another fade here would be very frustrating which means it is probably what will happen.
ChartSwingTrade	692815741494652929	2016-01-28T21:05:19	AMZN - that's pretty funny.   Crazy stuff there.
ChartSwingTrade	692793439755329538	2016-01-28T19:36:42	This Russell 5 minute chart looks too perfect as a pennant/coil type pattern.   Big move coming one way or the other when it breaks.
ChartSwingTrade	692758773459451906	2016-01-28T17:18:57	Another chopfest today.   Trying to be patient as there just isn't much to do right now.
ChartSwingTrade	692438283087921152	2016-01-27T20:05:26	This action is perfect timing for IBD who said yesterday was a follow-through day.   I should have known it wasn't going to work.
ChartSwingTrade	692436484499099648	2016-01-27T19:58:17	You take that one reversal bar out of Russell daily chart and you'll see a picture perfect bear flag
ChartSwingTrade	692433376846962689	2016-01-27T19:45:56	There we go.   Should be interesting battle here around 4500
ChartSwingTrade	692425727728304132	2016-01-27T19:15:32	Fwiw that 4500 level on Naz still holding.   May not for that long, but I will lean bullish as long as it does.
ChartSwingTrade	692425219248623617	2016-01-27T19:13:31	Fun market
ChartSwingTrade	692400931774795777	2016-01-27T17:37:00	Well that was fun.   Thought we might finally go but nope, right back into the range as of now.
ChartSwingTrade	692328209266798592	2016-01-27T12:48:02	Hyster87ia kind of leaving that way but if 4500 is broken, then all bets are off
ChartSwingTrade	692321626382139392	2016-01-27T12:21:53	A day where we start lower (today???) and then reverse and close above that 4600 level would be very big going forward IMO.
ChartSwingTrade	692321366901551108	2016-01-27T12:20:51	Little range being set up here on Nasdaq daily.   Playing 4600(long) vs 4500(short) may be too obvious, but those are key levels.
ChartSwingTrade	692084518606520320	2016-01-26T20:39:42	Instead of stepping back after that great day, I've just been too aggressive in a market that wasn't presenting that opportunity.
ChartSwingTrade	692083751594123265	2016-01-26T20:36:39	Since my best trading day ever last Wednesday, I have been horrible.  Often it happens that way.  Just getting chopped up.
ChartSwingTrade	692066658161147904	2016-01-26T19:28:43	Looking kind of toppy here on five minute charts...
ChartSwingTrade	691717688587108352	2016-01-25T20:22:03	That meaningful bottom is looking less and less likely.   Horrible action on small caps today.
ChartSwingTrade	691682922462576644	2016-01-25T18:03:54	Looking like this right range is just there to mess with people.
ChartSwingTrade	691677417627217920	2016-01-25T17:42:01	Tight little range forming here on Russell.  Hopefully we get a nice move one way or the other from it.
ChartSwingTrade	691430545176178691	2016-01-25T01:21:02	Palmer was pretty bad last week and had been even worse today.   Really crapping the bed.
ChartSwingTrade	691403699525005312	2016-01-24T23:34:22	Trent Diller could go from the worst to second worst QB to win a super bowl since 2000 in two weeks.
ChartSwingTrade	691403234821320704	2016-01-24T23:32:31	And then collectively cheers...
ChartSwingTrade	691402609530241024	2016-01-24T23:30:02	And America collectively groans...
ChartSwingTrade	690640463057985536	2016-01-22T21:01:32	Anyone holding over the weekend?  I could actually see a big gap Monday that is sold into.
ChartSwingTrade	690598193499893760	2016-01-22T18:13:34	Nothing but chop intraday.  Unless you held overnight, past two sessions haven't provided much
ChartSwingTrade	690590235835678720	2016-01-22T17:41:57	One of those days.   Had UPL at 2.27.  Stopped at 2.22. Now it will go.
ChartSwingTrade	690577454411440128	2016-01-22T16:51:10	Lower highs and lower lows on TNA so far on 5 minute
ChartSwingTrade	690577189788581890	2016-01-22T16:50:07	For as great as intraday action was Wednesday,  it has sucks equally as bad intraday the past two days.  At least for me.  Very very choppy.
ChartSwingTrade	690563468739678208	2016-01-22T15:55:35	Stopped on TNA again.  It's kicked my button past two days.
ChartSwingTrade	690264644171272196	2016-01-21T20:08:10	5 minute TNA chart looks somewhat toppy to me today.  Nothing set in stone but I'm doubting a nice 2-3 day bounce now.
ChartSwingTrade	690251825598087168	2016-01-21T19:17:14	Certainly not the greatest action here off of yesterday's reversal.  Momo just doesn't seem to be there.
ChartSwingTrade	690232962684616704	2016-01-21T18:02:16	Stopped for third time today on TNA.  Rough sledding for me.
ChartSwingTrade	690213665870450688	2016-01-21T16:45:36	Real chopfest so far.   Maybe that's good going forward but makes doing anything productive today difficult.
ChartSwingTrade	690202279450902530	2016-01-21T16:00:21	Stopped again on TNA.  Rough day so far.
ChartSwingTrade	690193742263746560	2016-01-21T15:26:25	Tricky day continues.   Might be like this for little while.  Maybe chop around a few days and then get a decent bounce
ChartSwingTrade	690183594413785088	2016-01-21T14:46:06	Just was stopped out.
ChartSwingTrade	690183341765758976	2016-01-21T14:45:06	Tricky early here as market tries to decide if it wants follow through.   I reentered tna but wouldn't be surprised I was stopped out
ChartSwingTrade	690174466094190592	2016-01-21T14:09:50	Tricky pre market so far.   Up then down.   Hard to get a read.
ChartSwingTrade	690150448188243969	2016-01-21T12:34:23	No follow through yet on yesterday's reversal.  Let's see what happens.   A small open lower like this may actually be good.
ChartSwingTrade	689916574975688704	2016-01-20T21:05:04	A little gap down tomorrow might actually be the best setup for a true reflex bounce that could last three to five days.
ChartSwingTrade	689916393869828096	2016-01-20T21:04:20	Especially with earnings reports, I think it's risky holding any ETFs/Ultra ETF overnight right now.  Will definitely watch TNA tomorrow.
ChartSwingTrade	689913370846298112	2016-01-20T20:52:20	I did hold onto the TNA in IRAs but wouldn't be shocked with quick shakeout tomorrow which is why I sold around $44.
ChartSwingTrade	689912958240038912	2016-01-20T20:50:41	As of now this is my most profitable day ever I believe.  Main account up 7%. I did sell TNA around $44.   May take a little back overnight
ChartSwingTrade	689893449420644353	2016-01-20T19:33:10	Was able to catch TNA pretty well today.   More than made up for yday's losses. If we can't bounce from this reversal, maybe we indeed crash
ChartSwingTrade	689857339017555968	2016-01-20T17:09:41	TZA daily chart completely parabolic.  Crazy action we are seeing here.
ChartSwingTrade	689538980510089219	2016-01-19T20:04:38	Maybe nasdaq needs to break 4300 before we get reflex bounce.   Obviously not happening today.   Ugly gets uglier
ChartSwingTrade	689509095544528897	2016-01-19T18:05:53	20 day Ema on 5 minute for TNA is absolute blanket today.   Cannot clear it.
ChartSwingTrade	689503343845109760	2016-01-19T17:43:02	Could be falling wedge on TNA five minute
ChartSwingTrade	689499783627575296	2016-01-19T17:28:53	Another TNA failure.   Sort of giving up hope of that meaningful reflex bounce
ChartSwingTrade	689484594433785856	2016-01-19T16:28:31	Trying TNA one more time.
ChartSwingTrade	689480763708801024	2016-01-19T16:13:18	Looks like no double bottom for TNA.  Out of it.   Now flat for the day
ChartSwingTrade	689475779982307328	2016-01-19T15:53:30	Just got stopped on TNA.  Gave it a little room instead of taking the pop.   Oh well.   Will continue to watch
ChartSwingTrade	689460584635498496	2016-01-19T14:53:07	Took some TNA here - stop in place.  Realize this may not work but trying anyway.  Quite stretched on 5 minute
ChartSwingTrade	689457885563133952	2016-01-19T14:42:24	If that $43 level wouldn't hold on TNA, then things change and I am no longer looking to play reflex bounce
ChartSwingTrade	689457281738510338	2016-01-19T14:40:00	PACB getting hit with the ugly stick today.  Was looking good and holding up well.
ChartSwingTrade	689457044739325952	2016-01-19T14:39:03	I'm thinking a move to between $43 and $44 for TNA, followed by a strong close, would be a really, really good sign for the week ahead.
ChartSwingTrade	689456433595711489	2016-01-19T14:36:37	For instance, maybe closing this gap in morning and falling a bit below, but then rallying back this afternoon.  Would lead to longer bounce
ChartSwingTrade	689456213579329536	2016-01-19T14:35:45	Wouldn't be the worst thing for market to shake out a few today w/ a 1/2 or full day pullback, assuming of course it rallies soon after.
ChartSwingTrade	689455792328544256	2016-01-19T14:34:05	That bounce on TNA has faded off of pre-market highs.  Watching closely.
ChartSwingTrade	689433625159282689	2016-01-19T13:05:59	Decent gap here this morning on TNA.  This is what I was expecting (but didn't have the guts to hold for over 3 days).  Will watch intraday.
ChartSwingTrade	688886340444794880	2016-01-18T00:51:17	I think the NFC wins regardless of Super Bowl match up.
ChartSwingTrade	688883845559525376	2016-01-18T00:41:22	Go Cardinals.
ChartSwingTrade	688883494966005761	2016-01-18T00:39:58	Oh well.   Last week withstanding,  Ben's "clutch" factor is way overrated IMO.  Over past three or four yrs, hasn't produced in those spots
ChartSwingTrade	688881695102111744	2016-01-18T00:32:49	Going in, only chance I thought Steelers had is two+ turnovers by Manning, and since that obviously not happening,  doesn't look good
ChartSwingTrade	688881112127438848	2016-01-18T00:30:30	Can't see this offense going 80 yards for a TD.   Denver will keep everything in front of them.  Hope I'm wrong.
ChartSwingTrade	688880181851734016	2016-01-18T00:26:48	So many chances to go up several scores and Steelers never could get it done.  Turnover huge obviously.
ChartSwingTrade	688878033910906881	2016-01-18T00:18:16	Absolute killer.  TD on that drive probably wins game.  Defense needs to get one.
ChartSwingTrade	688874662609080320	2016-01-18T00:04:52	Steelers have to be up by four near end of game because with the wind, McManus could make one from maybe 65.
ChartSwingTrade	688874439816052736	2016-01-18T00:03:59	Steelers punter having a heck of game.
ChartSwingTrade	688868648006643712	2016-01-17T23:40:58	How about a turnover here?
ChartSwingTrade	688865927694123008	2016-01-17T23:30:10	No PI, huh?
ChartSwingTrade	688856913191108609	2016-01-17T22:54:21	Would be a great time for a turnover
ChartSwingTrade	688855807442554881	2016-01-17T22:49:57	Scary thing here for Steelers fans is I don't think it's possible for Broncos to play worse.   Steelers need to get points here.
ChartSwingTrade	688842320125415424	2016-01-17T21:56:21	Need one yard.   Throw 40 yards.   Smart.
ChartSwingTrade	688839236024274944	2016-01-17T21:44:06	Blatant hold missed there
ChartSwingTrade	688581714835210241	2016-01-17T04:40:48	Honestly believe that if Larry didn't play with crap QBs for most of career (except Warner and Palmer) he would go down as best WR ever.
ChartSwingTrade	688578476299845632	2016-01-17T04:27:56	And this is one of many problems the NFL has going forward.  The outcome of this huge game will now comes down to a rules interpretation.
ChartSwingTrade	688103440258486274	2016-01-15T21:00:19	Few names worth watching next week - PACB, SWN, SEDG, BLD, ROVI.  I think we are near a four or five day tradeable bounce.
ChartSwingTrade	688102140754014208	2016-01-15T20:55:09	TSLA working into the close but that stock was hard to trade today
ChartSwingTrade	688100761058721792	2016-01-15T20:49:40	My gut tells me we gap up on Tuesday and start decent reflex bounce but I don't have the balls to hold anything over three days.  Total cash
ChartSwingTrade	688092926132371456	2016-01-15T20:18:32	Sold out at right time for TNA but didn't switch over to TZA so nothing to do now except call it a day.  Next week should be interesting.
ChartSwingTrade	688092393921363968	2016-01-15T20:16:25	Stopped on TSLA
ChartSwingTrade	688091531706646528	2016-01-15T20:12:59	Glad I took profits in TNA.  Yikes.  TSLA probably out too.
ChartSwingTrade	688089987208724480	2016-01-15T20:06:51	Sold TNA here.  Turning out to be a good day.  TSLA seems like it may work too.
ChartSwingTrade	688088106646421504	2016-01-15T19:59:23	TNA may break to new intraday highs here.
ChartSwingTrade	688087275805081601	2016-01-15T19:56:05	TSLA could go here - two previous tries on five minute failed.  Through those two spikes and it may squeeze
ChartSwingTrade	688085659886596096	2016-01-15T19:49:39	Russell may go again here
ChartSwingTrade	688081208144596992	2016-01-15T19:31:58	Trendline broken on Nasdaq 5 minute.
ChartSwingTrade	688079996431122432	2016-01-15T19:27:09	Out of SEDG with a small loss
ChartSwingTrade	688079150263840769	2016-01-15T19:23:47	Slipping here just a bit on Nasdaq.  Should be interesting final two hours.
ChartSwingTrade	688078698004660224	2016-01-15T19:22:00	Nasdaq right at uptrend line on this two plus hour bounce.  Needs to hold.
ChartSwingTrade	688070782321168384	2016-01-15T18:50:32	Took some SEDG here long for trade.  5 min looks good.
ChartSwingTrade	688069664132300800	2016-01-15T18:46:06	Took gains on TNA here.  Will keep watching.  Profitable for the session so that's a plus.
ChartSwingTrade	688069244806770690	2016-01-15T18:44:26	Bulls doing well for past hour or so...
ChartSwingTrade	688067240072065024	2016-01-15T18:36:28	Higher lows being made so far on five minute charts of Nasdaq, Russell
ChartSwingTrade	688066138853347328	2016-01-15T18:32:05	Bulls gotta hold this area.
ChartSwingTrade	688061626101047296	2016-01-15T18:14:09	nice job bulls
ChartSwingTrade	688060085138919425	2016-01-15T18:08:02	And breaking down a bit...bulls better hold here.
ChartSwingTrade	688058989964230656	2016-01-15T18:03:41	Both Nasdaq and Russell stopped right at 20 day EMA on 5 minute chart.  If they can bust through that, rest of day may be interesting.
ChartSwingTrade	688057691608973312	2016-01-15T17:58:31	So far this bounce attempt acting pretty well.  Wouldn't mind seeing a little flag set up here.  20 day EMA on 5 minute will be tough.
ChartSwingTrade	688053883843641344	2016-01-15T17:43:23	Took some TNA for a quick trade
ChartSwingTrade	688051514061930496	2016-01-15T17:33:58	New lows for SPX
ChartSwingTrade	688051373988909056	2016-01-15T17:33:25	Though TNA might be ready for a little move.  I was wrong.
ChartSwingTrade	688050234853703681	2016-01-15T17:28:54	Sold TZA here - will revisit.
ChartSwingTrade	688049381270880256	2016-01-15T17:25:30	ERY poised to breakout.  Watching but my gut says it reverses a breakout.
ChartSwingTrade	688047997280595968	2016-01-15T17:20:00	AMZN cracks a bit on 5 minute.  Nasdaq accelerating to downside here.
ChartSwingTrade	688034616414990336	2016-01-15T16:26:50	This is feeling more and more like a total chop day where it is best to stay out.  I've made three small trades so far and none have worked.
ChartSwingTrade	688031865186304001	2016-01-15T16:15:54	ERX breakdown.
ChartSwingTrade	688030831789629445	2016-01-15T16:11:47	There's a little push from the bears, at least on the small caps. Nasdaq still barely holding gap lows.  If that breaks, who knows?
ChartSwingTrade	688029341482135552	2016-01-15T16:05:52	Probably a key moment here.  If bears push, probably worth playing rest of day on short side.  If we bounce a little back, will be chop
ChartSwingTrade	688026564953534464	2016-01-15T15:54:50	Took small amount of TZA here - will look to add if it works.
ChartSwingTrade	688024956278575107	2016-01-15T15:48:27	Nice shakeout there on FIT - got me
ChartSwingTrade	688024366492323840	2016-01-15T15:46:06	So much for FIT.  Going to be one of those day where nothing is easy.
ChartSwingTrade	688022921047097344	2016-01-15T15:40:21	AMZN sort of flagging on the 5 min.
ChartSwingTrade	688022193662509060	2016-01-15T15:37:28	Tried some FIT at $18.06
ChartSwingTrade	688020072586199040	2016-01-15T15:29:02	About the only thing I see on my screen of interest is FIT which has a little flag on the 5 minute.  Everything is a choppy mess.
ChartSwingTrade	688016685589237760	2016-01-15T15:15:35	Unlike the past few days that had decent trends to trade intraday (both ways) today looks very choppy and hard.  Sitting on my hands.
ChartSwingTrade	688016399130865664	2016-01-15T15:14:26	Tried to short some TSLA but couldn't borrow.
ChartSwingTrade	688012952092446721	2016-01-15T15:00:45	So was that it for the bounce?  I was hoping for a little more so I could get some TZA cheaper
ChartSwingTrade	688009247670562816	2016-01-15T14:46:01	lalaruza74 Agreed.  I think the injury issue along with concussions is reason NFL has reached its popularity and will only go down.  IMO
ChartSwingTrade	688008234863603716	2016-01-15T14:42:00	I'd say anymore success in the NFL comes down to 45% talent, 45% luck with injuries, and 10% avoiding really bad calls that cost you a loss.
ChartSwingTrade	688006273955008513	2016-01-15T14:34:12	Burfict strikes again.  With AB out now, only chance Steelers have of winning is if Manning chokes and throws two or three picks.
ChartSwingTrade	688002782561882112	2016-01-15T14:20:20	TZA may end up being the only thing on my screen today.  With the long weekend ahead, I think you fade any bounces intraday today.
ChartSwingTrade	688001490703679488	2016-01-15T14:15:12	4300 is obvious level to watch on Naz. Wouldn't shock me to see it hit today.   With weekend ahead, everything will remain intraday for me.
ChartSwingTrade	688000924988514304	2016-01-15T14:12:57	Perhaps the little fade at end of yday was clue.  Truly strong bounce day would have squeezed people into the close.  Didn't expect this tho
ChartSwingTrade	687841995335856129	2016-01-15T03:41:25	Does Ted Cruz remind anyone else of a creepy televangelist?
ChartSwingTrade	687734715466518530	2016-01-14T20:35:08	Interested in seeing how much is given back here.  A truly strong bounce attempt around finish near highs.  Doesnt look like it today.
ChartSwingTrade	687734303703363586	2016-01-14T20:33:30	Should have taken profits again about five minutes ago.  Still a good day but could have had a bit more.
ChartSwingTrade	687733518835789826	2016-01-14T20:30:23	Too bad on NFLX.   Looked good on 5 minute
ChartSwingTrade	687703066573934593	2016-01-14T18:29:22	Sold out of most trades here.   Will watch and possibly revisit later
ChartSwingTrade	687688996206477312	2016-01-14T17:33:27	Will the Nasdaq push here?  5 minute chart looks very bullish right now.  Could change in a moments notice however based on this week
ChartSwingTrade	687681131987079168	2016-01-14T17:02:13	Don't want to jinx it but this action definitely looks better than previous bounce attempts this week.
ChartSwingTrade	687679523668688896	2016-01-14T16:55:49	TSLA 5 min looks good.   Flagging.
ChartSwingTrade	687678510417092608	2016-01-14T16:51:47	A higher low here intraday would sure be nice for a change.
ChartSwingTrade	687673838197456896	2016-01-14T16:33:14	Stupid me for actually thinking this bounce had a chance.   Held instead of taking quick pop.  Made a little but could have had a lot more
ChartSwingTrade	687667854280384512	2016-01-14T16:09:27	On the five minute chart this would be good area for RUT to hold if further gains are to be in the future today.
ChartSwingTrade	687378065253621760	2016-01-13T20:57:56	Not brave enough to hold anything overnight here.   Made a little on TZA.  Tomorrow should be interesting.
ChartSwingTrade	687376669028532225	2016-01-13T20:52:23	Naz might see 4300 tomorrow the way this is going.
ChartSwingTrade	687372452767358976	2016-01-13T20:35:38	Took a little TZA into close.   Expecting a sell off into 4:00 but of course could be wrong.   Only day trade
ChartSwingTrade	687369759999004672	2016-01-13T20:24:56	Ok to call this a "mini crash"  yet?   RUT down 13% in 10 days when it hit today's lows
ChartSwingTrade	687356360955179010	2016-01-13T19:31:41	New lows for Nasdaq.   Guess next bounce possibility is around 4300???
ChartSwingTrade	687318760487796736	2016-01-13T17:02:16	Trying to think of something worse than "ugly" to describe this action but can't come up with something.   Just keeps getting worse.
ChartSwingTrade	687016020884762624	2016-01-12T20:59:18	TNA worked well but I'm not holding overnight
ChartSwingTrade	686999678446137344	2016-01-12T19:54:21	TNA here
ChartSwingTrade	686991629429936129	2016-01-12T19:22:22	Considering Russell 2k was down about 10% in past 8 days don't know if it's possible to have uglier performance than it put on so far today
ChartSwingTrade	686965757188653058	2016-01-12T17:39:34	Looking very similar to yesterday.   Has similar bounce attempt around noon and a failure to new lows soon after.
ChartSwingTrade	686960880068759552	2016-01-12T17:20:11	And looks like so much for that bounce attempt.   Thought it might work
ChartSwingTrade	686953008266121216	2016-01-12T16:48:54	Trying some TNA here with stop at lows
ChartSwingTrade	686950121595088896	2016-01-12T16:37:26	Only hope I can see for nasdaq is maybe it holds yesterday afternoon's high as a support area.   Grabbing at straws here
ChartSwingTrade	686948163907923968	2016-01-12T16:29:39	Ugly as can be
ChartSwingTrade	686944177775579136	2016-01-12T16:13:49	Thought we might try to bounce there.   Guess not.
ChartSwingTrade	686938553029296129	2016-01-12T15:51:28	And that may be it for your rally folks.   Still watching but glad I sold early.   Everything needs to be very short term
ChartSwingTrade	686922354472161280	2016-01-12T14:47:06	Sold out here.   Will revisit later today.   Expecting a little intraday shakeout
ChartSwingTrade	686718105641332736	2016-01-12T01:15:29	Decided to hold my late longs overnight.  Could be a very good or a very bad move.  I have no idea which.
ChartSwingTrade	686654149774172160	2016-01-11T21:01:21	Figures.   Little fade at end keeps nasdaq red on daily.  Wouldn't be surprised with a anything tomorrow.  Bounce really wasn't that great.
ChartSwingTrade	686653421278105601	2016-01-11T20:58:27	Psychologically would be big to get that green daily bar on Nasdaq
ChartSwingTrade	686651992526204929	2016-01-11T20:52:47	This is the problem with a bounce that starts too late. Hard to trust it since it doesn't have as much time to give a cushion into next day
ChartSwingTrade	686646256110796800	2016-01-11T20:29:59	I've been catching some tiny losses past few sessions trying to catch a move.  If this works, will more than make up those losses.
ChartSwingTrade	686645393665470464	2016-01-11T20:26:33	Maybe this COULD be a decent short covering bounce...
ChartSwingTrade	686644100465045505	2016-01-11T20:21:25	Some TNA here but may be too late in day anyway to have massive short covering bounce
ChartSwingTrade	686642453294743552	2016-01-11T20:14:52	Really really really need a panicky wash out but if it hasn't come yet, not sure when it will happen.   Could just steadily sell off further
ChartSwingTrade	686641240490770432	2016-01-11T20:10:03	It would be nice if bulls could hold here but seem completely impotent.  Could be another drip drip drip lower to new lows into close
ChartSwingTrade	686604227301474304	2016-01-11T17:42:58	Seems like there is no panic out there.   The selling seems very orderly, systematic,  and deliberate.   Not good news for a bounce.
ChartSwingTrade	686599304312676352	2016-01-11T17:23:25	Looks like we are STILL not ready to bounce.
ChartSwingTrade	686059419042332672	2016-01-10T05:38:06	If Ben plays next week in Denver, it might be first game in NFL history where neither QB can throw the ball farther than 20 yards.
ChartSwingTrade	686054041244319744	2016-01-10T05:16:44	NFL's problems going forward were clearly shown tonight. So much of the outcomes depend on injuries, penalties, rule interpretation, etc.
ChartSwingTrade	686053844502052864	2016-01-10T05:15:57	It seems like the actual playing of the game is almost secondary to everything else.
ChartSwingTrade	686049711153901568	2016-01-10T04:59:31	Would be very surprised if Marvin Lewis wasn't fired tomorrow.   No control over his team.
ChartSwingTrade	686048763111149569	2016-01-10T04:55:45	One of the weirdest games I've ever seen.   If I'm the Bengals I'm cutting burfict tonight.
ChartSwingTrade	686048432860082182	2016-01-10T04:54:27	I spoke too soon earlier so I'm not going to say anything about the Bengals deserving to lose this site to their immense stupidity
ChartSwingTrade	686047442706513920	2016-01-10T04:50:31	Burfict might be the dirtiest player I have ever seen in the NFL.  One of the stupidest too.
ChartSwingTrade	686044371221897217	2016-01-10T04:38:18	Mike Tomlin now no playoff wins in five years and has lost to AJ McCarron and Tim Tebow.
ChartSwingTrade	686042877420564480	2016-01-10T04:32:22	And the idiotic call of passing on 3rd and 18 with the Bengals fired up, putting Ben in danger.   Game over now.
ChartSwingTrade	686042661040603136	2016-01-10T04:31:31	Give the Bengals credit but Todd Haley has coached a horrible game.   Going conservative in first half even after Cinci lost pro bowl safety
ChartSwingTrade	686032740211404804	2016-01-10T03:52:05	Todd Haley was conservative all game but on a 3rd and 18 in your own end up by 15 and the defense fired up,  you pass???  Run a draw, punt.
ChartSwingTrade	685567748819128322	2016-01-08T21:04:23	Should be an interesting weekend.   I could see market gapping up Monday 1-2% or down 3-4% and not be surprised with either
ChartSwingTrade	685224511470485504	2016-01-07T22:20:29	Kevin Love, Andrew Wiggins forever linked, yet each making his own way:  cavs wolves 
ChartSwingTrade	685195633595133954	2016-01-07T20:25:44	If this continues through tomorrow, Monday will be quite interesting.
ChartSwingTrade	685189587380137989	2016-01-07T20:01:42	And right back down...
ChartSwingTrade	685185351808331777	2016-01-07T19:44:52	TNA again here.   Trying again for day trade
ChartSwingTrade	685161063097090048	2016-01-07T18:08:21	TSLA keeps hanging in even though market tanking this past hour.   That's the one I'm watching if for some reason market bounces today
ChartSwingTrade	685151132478345216	2016-01-07T17:28:54	TSLA fail
ChartSwingTrade	685151012806500353	2016-01-07T17:28:25	None of these individual names like NFLX or TSLA are going to go unless the indexes move too.  Pretty simple.
ChartSwingTrade	685146600730177536	2016-01-07T17:10:53	Intraday chart of TSLA (5 min) looks pretty good
ChartSwingTrade	685144160907751426	2016-01-07T17:01:11	Saw some intraday patterns but absolutely nothing is working.  More lows coming?
ChartSwingTrade	685138476736606208	2016-01-07T16:38:36	NFLX looks decent, stop under $118
ChartSwingTrade	685135572843757568	2016-01-07T16:27:04	Looking like I'll be out flat with TNA.   Oh well.
ChartSwingTrade	685127628299329537	2016-01-07T15:55:30	Took some TNA around $54.17, just for the heck of it.   Will move stop up if it works.
ChartSwingTrade	684841276219482113	2016-01-06T20:57:38	Pretty much untradeable unless you are scalping right now.   Getting bored with 2016.
ChartSwingTrade	684073095070650368	2016-01-04T18:05:09	Triple bottom in the Nasdaq daily?  Have a hard time believing it as so much damage was done today to individual names like AMZN,  NFLX
ChartSwingTrade	684036322395340800	2016-01-04T15:39:02	Market very unhealthy but chasing shorts here is dangerous.   Not much to do other than sit on hands.   Sucks but the right play.
ChartSwingTrade	684035589948223488	2016-01-04T15:36:08	Not sure there is any way for trading yr to start out worse.  I'm in cash, did nothing today, but I think I won't be doing much for a while
ChartSwingTrade	683725457632681984	2016-01-03T19:03:46	AFC potential playoff teams playing like crap today with a lot on the line (Patriots, Bengals, Jets, Steelers)
ChartSwingTrade	682647605726294016	2015-12-31T19:40:46	The Naz looks very toppy &amp; 2 biggest leaders (AMZN NFLX) showed very poor action today.  Maybe this is head fake but not good into new yr.
ChartSwingTrade	682610803560812545	2015-12-31T17:14:32	Just got my stop run on SQ.   Thank you.
ChartSwingTrade	682606821949980672	2015-12-31T16:58:43	Took some SQ around $13.30.  Daily chart looks good and volume strong.
ChartSwingTrade	682577179692150784	2015-12-31T15:00:55	Took some TSLA with tight stop.  Not seeing much else.
ChartSwingTrade	682575868871467009	2015-12-31T14:55:43	Looking like a day to shut things down early.   Not much easy out there.
ChartSwingTrade	682574557790744577	2015-12-31T14:50:30	Stopped out on NK from yesterday.  All cash. Market sucks right now.
ChartSwingTrade	682572270422880256	2015-12-31T14:41:25	SEDG took out my IRA stops and right back up.
ChartSwingTrade	682571835972653057	2015-12-31T14:39:41	AMZN back to breakout level.   Will it hold?   Failure in a name like this would be bad omen going forward.
ChartSwingTrade	682570255479238656	2015-12-31T14:33:25	Ugly start and back through the 50 day on the Nasdaq.   Topping pattern forming or just more chop?
ChartSwingTrade	682305959650299904	2015-12-30T21:03:12	I'm holding one long in main account and two in Ira but overall very cautious here.   Looks like more chop ahead.
ChartSwingTrade	682305825700974593	2015-12-30T21:02:40	A good day personally for me on long side today but are excellent action yesterday, today's action was very disappointing.
ChartSwingTrade	682255098932637696	2015-12-30T17:41:05	Don't know why - just a gut feeling (and hope I'm wrong) but wouldn't be shocked to see Naz test its 50 day MA today it tomorrow.
ChartSwingTrade	682254402015514625	2015-12-30T17:38:19	Nasdaq setting up for big move here intraday one way or the other.
ChartSwingTrade	682253081417887746	2015-12-30T17:33:04	Just got stopped on TSLA.  watch market here.
ChartSwingTrade	682252424573104132	2015-12-30T17:30:28	SEDG now fading a bit.   Got stopped out in main position.
ChartSwingTrade	682251096153182208	2015-12-30T17:25:11	Definitely tightening things up here.   Bulls just can't seem to get a push. intraday
ChartSwingTrade	682245411613110273	2015-12-30T17:02:36	DGAZ pushing again
ChartSwingTrade	682243295540465664	2015-12-30T16:54:11	ACHN looks good but I saw it too late.   Will watch intraday for setup
ChartSwingTrade	682240339545960448	2015-12-30T16:42:27	Added a little to DGAZ for day trade
ChartSwingTrade	682239396658069507	2015-12-30T16:38:42	Bottoming pattern in place on Nasdaq 5 minute chart here if bulls want to step up and play.
ChartSwingTrade	682236131233026049	2015-12-30T16:25:43	Added a little to TSLA here from yesterday.   Stop pretty clear intraday.
ChartSwingTrade	682235223824707584	2015-12-30T16:22:07	Slipping a little bit is what I meant to say.
ChartSwingTrade	682234858786000896	2015-12-30T16:20:40	Be careful.   Nasdaq slipping here intraday.
