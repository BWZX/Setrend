jkaonline	706526117952405505	2016-03-06T17:05:27	you got me.... 
jkaonline	706526481472557056	2016-03-06T17:06:54	D_Blanchflower In 1988 we were trying to explain to Lawson and Treasury, interest rates impact on consumer spending too not just investment
jkaonline	706525226239180802	2016-03-06T17:01:55	jkaonline in 1988 we spent ages experimenting with functional forms for a flat bit log U and (log U) cubed where u=Unempt rate worked well!
jkaonline	706521510857437184	2016-03-06T16:47:09	jkaonline me in 1968....!
jkaonline	706522193841287169	2016-03-06T16:49:52	D_Blanchflower Actually it's a 50 year plus addiction but I agree with your flat curve at the lower jobs bound,
jkaonline	706521222255742976	2016-03-06T16:46:00	jkaonline ok you got me....26 years is a long time in economics! but we also said that wage curves become flat once high unempt reached!
jkaonline	706520990831005696	2016-03-06T16:45:05	D_Blanchflower Yep you've been at it a long time! I guess we both have! First picked up Lipsey and Samuelson in 1964!
jkaonline	706520007681957889	2016-03-06T16:41:10	D_Blanchflower I am quoting your concluding remarks not mine,
jkaonline	706518562358202368	2016-03-06T16:35:26	jkaonline you mean wage growth rises when you come off the flat part of the wage curve?
jkaonline	706519834620776448	2016-03-06T16:40:29	D_Blanchflower The NIESR piece 2015 is well argued but suggests earnings accelerate sub 5% under employment. The 1990 quote was yours.
jkaonline	706516948478078976	2016-03-06T16:29:01	jkaonline i didn't say that this is what i did say   
jkaonline	706513917200076800	2016-03-06T16:16:58	jkaonline i have been doing this wage unemployment stuff for a really long time....
jkaonline	706514351046299648	2016-03-06T16:18:42	jkaonline Reasonable to ask the question if the settlement norm is 3% which groups have received &gt;2% other than CEOs &amp; MPs I can't name any
jkaonline	706515282454380544	2016-03-06T16:22:24	jkaonline didn't you predict wage growth going to take off last year &amp; year before that &amp; year before that &amp; the year before that? I didn't
jkaonline	706515808382545924	2016-03-06T16:24:29	jkaonline  Not sure but is that the guy who predicted 5m uk unemployment...Wen it actually fell?
jkaonline	706516342439018496	2016-03-06T16:26:37	D_Blanchflower Ah yes "Wage flexibility is greatest when unemployment is low "
jkaonline	706514783252525056	2016-03-06T16:20:25	jkaonline the more i practice the luckier i get  
jkaonline	706515388109033472	2016-03-06T16:22:49	D_Blanchflower Yes I can well understand that. Thanks for sharing! We shall review this again ere too long, I trust, J
jkaonline	706513968576274432	2016-03-06T16:17:11	D_Blanchflower "current wage growth norm for average wages of around 2% is here to stay" What's not to quibble, conjecture - not hypothesis
jkaonline	706513084337123328	2016-03-06T16:13:40	jkaonline you aren't really going to quibble with the 2% evidence are you from multiple sources given AWE excludes workers in all firms&lt;20?
jkaonline	706511590439436288	2016-03-06T16:07:44	D_Blanchflower Yep I have seen that, not sure how your 2% hypothesis holds as earnings average 3% in Q3, Q4 data is the anomaly
jkaonline	706510953064468480	2016-03-06T16:05:12	jkaonline we are not kind to the Old Lady here who still believes we are mean reverting to 2004 soon 
jkaonline	706510742892056576	2016-03-06T16:04:22	jkaonline mistake folk make pre 2008 unempt rate good measure lmkt slack post 2008=an underestimate need underempt in UK + inactivity in US
jkaonline	706510336858296322	2016-03-06T16:02:45	jkaonline how did hours do? they fell from 34.6 to 34.4 on the month
jkaonline	706510199423684609	2016-03-06T16:02:12	D_Blanchflower Yep you have me there! I find myself in the same street as The Old Lady!
jkaonline	706509847341068288	2016-03-06T16:00:48	jkaonline earnings fell on the month and wage growth slowing entirely consistent with our predictions &amp; entirely inconsistent with yours
jkaonline	706508934937444352	2016-03-06T15:57:11	jkaonline plus uK our latest underempt rate for Q415 6.2% with full empt rate likely &lt;4% hence why no wage growth 
jkaonline	706508713109155840	2016-03-06T15:56:18	jkaonline the decline in the participation rate almost entirely cyclical hence why no wage growth but lots empt growth as inactivity falls
jkaonline	706509247920660481	2016-03-06T15:58:25	D_Blanchflower Yep, Earnings the one outlier left to cling too - a change in outlook just a revision away, latest US payroll revisions up!
jkaonline	706508391947096072	2016-03-06T15:55:01	jkaonline absolutely not - and why no wage pressure Empt rate is now approx 4pp below 2008 levels zero overheating 
jkaonline	706507833089597441	2016-03-06T15:52:48	D_Blanchflower well that comes as no surprise J But US Labor stats suggest US overheating along with UK as vacancies &gt; claimants ...
jkaonline	706504782643642368	2016-03-06T15:40:41	djlc78 jkaonline D_Blanchflower corroborates trade relationship IMHO - no major pick up in either on the horizon.
jkaonline	706506300084113408	2016-03-06T15:46:42	jkaonline couldn't disagree more ....
jkaonline	706503887142952960	2016-03-06T15:37:07	RebeccaAHarding djlc78 D_Blanchflower With demand conditions improving, a modest supply squeeze goes a long way, watch oil and copper
jkaonline	706503062819573760	2016-03-06T15:33:51	djlc78 jkaonline D_Blanchflower commodity prices &amp; trade 95% correlated. Trade growth too sluggish to 2018 to create any major hike
jkaonline	706502494466211841	2016-03-06T15:31:35	djlc78 I thought you couldn't forecast more than six months ahead? But now suddenly ...
jkaonline	706501639495147520	2016-03-06T15:28:11	jkaonline D_Blanchflower no evidence to suggest commodity prices rise this year,2017 before rise kicks in
jkaonline	706500329882394625	2016-03-06T15:22:59	D_Blanchflower Fed will continue to push rates higher, U.K. will follow as oil and commodity prices rally to push UK inflation higher!
jkaonline	706451330139873280	2016-03-06T12:08:16	jkaonline MPC "will be forced to act this year, as growth continues, the lmkt tightens, earnings increase &amp; inflation trends return.." 1/2
jkaonline	706451681060495360	2016-03-06T12:09:40	jkaonline "We expect UK rates to rise in the Q2 or Q3 this year as inflation accelerates in Q316" I disagree - next move will be a cut 2/2
