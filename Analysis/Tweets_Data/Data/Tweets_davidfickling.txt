davidfickling	709140036202024960	2016-03-13T22:12:14	Noahpinion The state mandated higher wages for white people and refused home loan aid to black people. No economic/racial link there?
davidfickling	709138474276773889	2016-03-13T22:06:02	Noahpinion Clearly most Trump fans aren't earnest students of U.S. race history. But that dynamic may be older than the U.S. middle class
davidfickling	709137616440983552	2016-03-13T22:02:37	Noahpinion I don't see a causal link. But historically, white privilege *has* been a ticket to the U.S. middle class.

davidfickling	686829576245260288	2016-01-12T08:38:26	Wonderful piece by jamescaig on Bowie here: 
davidfickling	686723493119971328	2016-01-12T01:36:54	8. There's a separate related issue round online harassment. "Free speech is under attack!" is male commentator-speak for "I feel harassed"
davidfickling	686721417589559296	2016-01-12T01:28:39	7. Someone passionately, even angrily or mockingly disagreeing with you isn't a creeping restriction on free speech. It *is* free speech.
davidfickling	686720333596864512	2016-01-12T01:24:20	6. That's free speech! I get that being on the receiving end of an outrage storm must be unpleasant. But it's not the thin end of a wedge
davidfickling	686719952129163265	2016-01-12T01:22:49	5. But if commentators can't justify their opinions, they should accept that either they're wrong or will never convince everyone &amp; move on.
davidfickling	686719678996037633	2016-01-12T01:21:44	4. One of the benefits of having a prominent media perch is that one's views have a lot of prestige. PC and right-wing mobs challenge that.
davidfickling	686719403736444929	2016-01-12T01:20:39	3. What would solving this require, short of restricting free speech for "your twitter mob" or setting up some cosy Debates Commission?
davidfickling	686719226766176256	2016-01-12T01:19:56	2. Seems to be more "the free speech of your twitter mob offended me" or "your mob exert too much power over bookings for debate events"
davidfickling	686719089411108864	2016-01-12T01:19:24	1. It's odd this is branded a "free speech" issue. At least in the U.S., there's hardly any claims the *state* limits speech mattyglesias
