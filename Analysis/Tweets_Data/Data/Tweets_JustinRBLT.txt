JustinRBLT	724969905951522816	2016-04-26T14:34:29	ChuckHill137 As with many reg changes, impossible 2 know exactly how market participants will react. Lower cap = less flexibility.
JustinRBLT	724969225291444225	2016-04-26T14:31:47	ChuckHill137 only after Reg NMS  made them captive exchange customers (and demutualization happened) did they divert big volume to DPs
JustinRBLT	724968862362550272	2016-04-26T14:30:20	ChuckHill137 you're half right. Without Reg ATS AND Reg NMS, big-broker dark pools likely wouldn't exist. First ATSs were lit markets.

JustinRBLT	724967667870883841	2016-04-26T14:25:35	ChuckHill137 no doubt, but in this case his own interests contain quite a bit of truth and help illuminate the motives of big brokers
