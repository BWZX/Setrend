AlexConant	698700718681624576	2016-02-14T02:50:07	Good response from Rubio on his tax plan, too. Focuses on families and working-class economics.
AlexConant	698700733655490560	2016-02-14T02:50:10	Rubio is on his game tonight. GOPDebate

AlexConant	698700505606987777	2016-02-14T02:49:16	Good question, good answer on child tax credit. "It's their money."
AlexConant	698700171409022979	2016-02-14T02:47:56	A VERY good moment for Rubio 
AlexConant	698700516709310464	2016-02-14T02:49:19	Great Rubio answer on child tax credit.
AlexConant	698699651831062528	2016-02-14T02:45:52	It's not that "some analysts" say Ted Cruz's tax is "akin" to a VAT. It IS a VAT. Whether a tax is a VAT is not a matter of opinion.

AlexConant	698698856666562561	2016-02-14T02:42:43	Rubio was far and away the best in that first segment, even defended W. better than his brother did. Still amazed at trump attack on W.
AlexConant	698698727226146817	2016-02-14T02:42:12	Rubio won that first segment. Cruz did well but didn't assert himself enough. Bush did pretty well. Trump was ... Trump.

AlexConant	698697638300921856	2016-02-14T02:37:52	Rubio somehow emerged as the defender of George W. Bush there.  Which is weird because Jeb Bush was on stage.

AlexConant	687845402964570112	2016-01-15T03:54:58	Rubio came prepared for this tax exchange, and he's strong on it.
AlexConant	687845062370291712	2016-01-15T03:53:37	Cruz's plan IS a VAT. Rubio's criticism is valid. And Cruz isn't addressing its risk as Trojan horse for higher, hidden rates. GOPDebate.
AlexConant	687845315270066176	2016-01-15T03:54:37	Cruz is lying. His plan is a VAT.

AlexConant	687844615169388544	2016-01-15T03:51:50	Rubio is so, so, so correct on this.
AlexConant	687845112982953984	2016-01-15T03:53:49	So how can Cruz be so certain that businesses won't pass the cost of the tax on to their customers?
AlexConant	687845234575851521	2016-01-15T03:54:18	Rubio to Cruz: "You may rename the IRS but you're not gonna abolish the IRS because some agency is going to have to collect your VAT tax."
AlexConant	687840979051802625	2016-01-15T03:37:23	Rubio reminds us that taxes on imports (tariffs) are taxes paid by American consumers--not foreign type people.

AlexConant	687830728441245698	2016-01-15T02:56:39	Rubio is absolutely right. Obama always cites as justification shootings that don’t intersect with his proposals.
AlexConant	687830729322029056	2016-01-15T02:56:39	Rubio just hit the Second amendment question out of the park. He is methodically taking apart the Obama argument on guns.
