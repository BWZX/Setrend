digby56	696174030903074816	2016-02-07T03:29:57	Rubio has chosen to err on the side of forcing a 14 year old girl to bear her father's child.

digby56	696168124777803777	2016-02-07T03:06:29	Trump talks a lot about law and order on the stump but it doesn't get much attention.
digby56	696166497111003136	2016-02-07T03:00:01	Why do people like Rubio? He's good looking, his family is beautiful but his staccato speaking style is officious and fake. I don't get it.
digby56	696164536420794368	2016-02-07T02:52:14	Christie cut treatment $$$ in NJ, btw
digby56	696164062925873152	2016-02-07T02:50:21	Obama has had the fewest executive orders since Grover Cleveland (via FiveThirtyEight) 
digby56	696163834294353920	2016-02-07T02:49:26	Oh thank God that national security portion is over. I feel like I've been watching a horror movie.
digby56	696163029256261634	2016-02-07T02:46:14	Yeah, because he has a magic wand (or baseball bat) to make people do what he wants them to do.  
digby56	696162442229907456	2016-02-07T02:43:54	Cruz says Obama is abusing executive power with education regulations. But he would have the authority to torture.

digby56	696161586763857920	2016-02-07T02:40:30	And Trump gets big applause for saying he'd do worse than waterboarding. I wonder which of the donors in the audience did that?
digby56	696161310501789697	2016-02-07T02:39:25	Cruz says the president can torture if he wants to. Not surprising. Failing to try torturers for war crimes leads to this.

digby56	696158401324187648	2016-02-07T02:27:51	Cruz is good with war crimes. Let's just be clear about that.
digby56	696158162957635585	2016-02-07T02:26:54	Cruz doesn't seem to know what saturation bombing is.
