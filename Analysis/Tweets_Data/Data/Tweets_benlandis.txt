benlandis	717157948208721921	2016-04-05T01:12:33	jonathonbarton yeah. Thanks for your point of view. I'm trying to figure it all out.
benlandis	717151682107277313	2016-04-05T00:47:39	Feral_Timelord2 I know, right? Let's burn down his house!
benlandis	717147194642436096	2016-04-05T00:29:49	REDEarth911 my experience is a little... different.
benlandis	717145534813712386	2016-04-05T00:23:14	RavenRuckus sure! Let me think and read about it and I will get back to you. And maybe at the end I will have been wrong. Or not! We'll see
benlandis	717142998723657728	2016-04-05T00:13:09	RavenRuckus I'll have to think about this some more.
benlandis	717142489417666560	2016-04-05T00:11:07	RavenRuckus I dunnnno, might be less accurate. I wasn't originally intending to include "victims" as an inclusionary category
benlandis	717140222689955840	2016-04-05T00:02:07	RavenRuckus idea: seeing oneself as the victim of the negative actions of others may be a precipitating factor in developing fibromyalgia.
benlandis	717136575923142656	2016-04-04T23:47:38	Mindinfusions RavenRuckus however, I still think it may be the most accurate expression of the idea I was trying to express. I don't know.
benlandis	717135950376083456	2016-04-04T23:45:08	Mindinfusions RavenRuckus yes, "victim mentality" may have been an unnecessarily hurtful and/or incorrect term for me to use.
benlandis	717128683345940480	2016-04-04T23:16:16	I've been getting into trance lately.
benlandis	717098709796782081	2016-04-04T21:17:10	And why?
benlandis	717098483983863809	2016-04-04T21:16:16	Or is this about power differential? Or motives? Or actual effect on the world and people?
benlandis	717098180706369537	2016-04-04T21:15:03	Maybe the smarter an opponent is, the more fun it's OK to have trying to brutally cut them down with wit and manipulation?
benlandis	717097719647461376	2016-04-04T21:13:14	"Do they think their understanding of this interaction is on the same plane as I think their understanding of this interaction is?"
benlandis	717041443030695936	2016-04-04T17:29:36	lodix1 good point.
benlandis	717040250099335169	2016-04-04T17:24:52	ahadley13 checking it out!
benlandis	717037687643869184	2016-04-04T17:14:41	FromageTheDog that's what I'm getting at.
benlandis	717031176838389760	2016-04-04T16:48:49	aklovesswim what?! Haha
benlandis	717027574082248704	2016-04-04T16:34:30	Is there good manipulation? Explain.
benlandis	717026428751970304	2016-04-04T16:29:56	kanchankumar I do not understand.
benlandis	717025684716032000	2016-04-04T16:26:59	Empathy and perspective seem like potential risk factors for becoming a manipulative bastard.
benlandis	716984956036120576	2016-04-04T13:45:09	BobFoolery there are tons of differences between all these things for sure. I'm just surprised by how many useful similarities they share.
benlandis	716983727570595840	2016-04-04T13:40:16	jennesaisquoi7 maybe you are a better person for that.
benlandis	716981327833116673	2016-04-04T13:30:44	BobFoolery I guess second-person and third-person views are both important...
benlandis	716980559281426432	2016-04-04T13:27:40	BobFoolery I was thinking more along the lines of the perspectives of the pieces on the board.
benlandis	716963187086610432	2016-04-04T12:18:38	omega_bunny yeah!!
benlandis	716933624839274496	2016-04-04T10:21:10	gkiltzVA if Twitter were to slowly incrementally increase the limit, it would give a pleasing freeing sensation while keeping the culture.
benlandis	716932829255303168	2016-04-04T10:18:01	gkiltzVA maybe 160 characters would be ideal where 140 characters falls short. That's the kind of thing I'm suggesting.
benlandis	716932305265106944	2016-04-04T10:15:56	gkiltzVA yes, and that is good. But a slightly bigger limit might still qualify as concise while making reading and writing tweets better.
benlandis	716923183073374208	2016-04-04T09:39:41	LordDragon65 jack however, Jack, if you're interested, I have a lot of ideas for how to improve Twitter! Don't know where to express them.
benlandis	716922513511481344	2016-04-04T09:37:01	LordDragon65 jack I've preferred to shout into the ether, lest I be snapped like a twig.
benlandis	716920033268473857	2016-04-04T09:27:10	Ruin_Or_Rapture 2 am here. But  woke up a few hours ago; sleep schedule is all messed up.
benlandis	716919623371730944	2016-04-04T09:25:32	Mindinfusions instead of "less relatable" maybe I should have said "less striking".
benlandis	716918371606863872	2016-04-04T09:20:34	If Twitter would juuuust notch up that character limit by like ten characters every year for the next X years, it would be perfect.
benlandis	716916843403816960	2016-04-04T09:14:29	It would feel great and be terrible to "pay forward" the grievances one has from unfair categorization against the perpetrator's categories.

benlandis	716910679920250884	2016-04-04T08:50:00	hamuscant good morning.
benlandis	716910372750405632	2016-04-04T08:48:47	VTEagleScout100 don't worry, I'm not.
benlandis	716908704793124864	2016-04-04T08:42:09	I bet revenge is so sweet, even with great collateral damage. It probably tastes amazing even for those of us obsessed with doing moral good
benlandis	716907223625039872	2016-04-04T08:36:16	Scapegoating is wrong.
benlandis	716904625014644736	2016-04-04T08:25:56	Is everything basically like everything else? Animals have societies, sex and power is all, nothing is special, laws are eventually wrong?
benlandis	716903672131620865	2016-04-04T08:22:09	Are humor, empathy, and thinking all like chess? Are these all like a database system? Is everything perspective?

benlandis	716898577880993793	2016-04-04T08:01:54	Mindinfusions RavenRuckus however, it's less relatable &amp; not at all compelling when put this way. I will have to chew on that for a while.
benlandis	716897602579468291	2016-04-04T07:58:02	Mindinfusions RavenRuckus yeah, that certainly goes at least partway toward what I was getting at!
benlandis	716896689219473409	2016-04-04T07:54:24	RavenRuckus thank you for your insight.
benlandis	716894873878552577	2016-04-04T07:47:11	bithell_ebooks what promise?
benlandis	716894665337733120	2016-04-04T07:46:22	bithell_ebooks I will be sure to let you know.
benlandis	716894011030540288	2016-04-04T07:43:46	bithell_ebooks I can't tell if that was a meaningful response. If so, pretty good!
benlandis	716893254390665217	2016-04-04T07:40:45	IAmAphroditeOz thank you!
benlandis	716891974268092418	2016-04-04T07:35:40	Being sick is so awful. I rarely appreciate how awful it is, and how nice good health is, except for when I'm sick and it is all consuming.
benlandis	716889649998798849	2016-04-04T07:26:26	judeoneill I put thought and care into the things I say. I'm not just asking questions randomly!
benlandis	716490610404757504	2016-04-03T05:00:47	RavenRuckus 1echidna he implied I'm a sociopath and is just trying to make me shut up using flimsy arguments and ad-hominem attacks.
benlandis	716489367607316480	2016-04-03T04:55:51	RavenRuckus I hadn't thought about that.
benlandis	716481083986960384	2016-04-03T04:22:56	pacearly I like the look of that cat!
benlandis	716456435106717696	2016-04-03T02:44:59	RavenRuckus however, I must keep working on learning and working to do a better job. Thank you for your point of view.
benlandis	716456095594651648	2016-04-03T02:43:38	RavenRuckus I care about having the greatest net benefit as possible. That isn't at odds with my having asked the question I asked.
benlandis	716455331568623616	2016-04-03T02:40:36	RavenRuckus the goal is to make life better. And to help people. My want to do that is where I get my sense of purpose.
benlandis	716451787037741056	2016-04-03T02:26:31	RavenRuckus *phrasing
benlandis	716451702275055617	2016-04-03T02:26:11	RavenRuckus I will work on having useful things to say, and on my word choice and paying, and on my empathy.
benlandis	716451538902716416	2016-04-03T02:25:32	RavenRuckus It seemed potentially useful enough to be worth posting. That's why posted it.
benlandis	716451413455298561	2016-04-03T02:25:02	RavenRuckus and especially if that is the case, my original question might be valid. Maybe. Maybe not.
benlandis	716450956175495168	2016-04-03T02:23:13	RavenRuckus however, I think it's possible a victim mentality is a thing --yes, with all the connotations that go along with that.
benlandis	716450543338545152	2016-04-03T02:21:35	RavenRuckus maybe you're right that it is not productive to use that phrase. I really don't know. My opinion may not be worth much on that.
benlandis	716449877547331584	2016-04-03T02:18:56	RavenRuckus I agree it was a dick thing to say, and I think it was the right response.
benlandis	716447461183631361	2016-04-03T02:09:20	oneunderstands I agree. But that's no reason why a contactless purchase/pickup of antibiotics wouldn't work.
benlandis	716446556229017600	2016-04-03T02:05:44	RavenRuckus angelmeguk good idea.
benlandis	716445896758599681	2016-04-03T02:03:07	oneunderstands what is the strongest counter-argument you've read that challenges these ideas? Have you read what both sides have to say?
benlandis	716445041833578496	2016-04-03T01:59:43	BriceSikes maybe not for oxycontin, but surely for antibiotics.
benlandis	716444755907837953	2016-04-03T01:58:35	BriceSikes I think Internet purchasing/signing + something like Apple Pay for identity when picking up would do the job nicely!
benlandis	716443194980872192	2016-04-03T01:52:23	oneunderstands looking into this. By aduvant do you mean adjuvant?
benlandis	716441315404165121	2016-04-03T01:44:55	oneunderstands I have no idea.
benlandis	716440898154795008	2016-04-03T01:43:15	oneunderstands yeah, I'm interested in this idea.
benlandis	716439294877896704	2016-04-03T01:36:53	oneunderstands what is the activating principle? It's not a conspiracy thing is it?
benlandis	716438587214995456	2016-04-03T01:34:04	SheNerdsOut sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.
benlandis	716438074981396485	2016-04-03T01:32:02	oneunderstands I would understand your tweets way more if you would always spell out words like that since they're not normally shortened.

benlandis	716436105478836224	2016-04-03T01:24:12	BriceSikes had to enter pin number! And press the buttons saying "do you agree this is a prescription and stuff"
benlandis	716434710495305729	2016-04-03T01:18:40	modernsimplicty is it possible that experiencing more physical pain from psychological sources might develop it into a feature of a person?
benlandis	716432579197448192	2016-04-03T01:10:12	modernsimplicty the rough idea is: when we perceive more hurt, we perceive more physical pain.
benlandis	716424146092068866	2016-04-03T00:36:41	1echidna you do not depend on anything from me in order for you to continue living your life. Please don't think about me anymore.
benlandis	716421494679736321	2016-04-03T00:26:09	FigVilleUSA 1echidna by people I really meant we. What control do we have over our bodies and minds.

benlandis	716406717764898817	2016-04-02T23:27:26	1echidna the root question this gets back to (I think) is, what control do people have over our bodies and minds?
benlandis	716406001939849216	2016-04-02T23:24:35	1echidna no way! Come on, why are you assuming the worst about my intentions?
benlandis	716405565807681536	2016-04-02T23:22:51	angelmeguk that was not my intention. I wish you the best.
benlandis	716405423243309056	2016-04-02T23:22:17	redlindup I actually thought of this because of wondering whether my own response to antibiotics was at least partly psychosomatic.
benlandis	716405201884676097	2016-04-02T23:21:24	redlindup I could believe it!

benlandis	716402235677106177	2016-04-02T23:09:37	I wonder if people with a victim mentality are more likely to develop fibromyalgia.

benlandis	703023842701094913	2016-02-26T01:08:40	At least engineer robots that get a shot of robot dopamine whenever they fulfill their intended design purpose.
benlandis	703023604422676481	2016-02-26T01:07:43	Maybe the very first things we need to engineer into our lifelike robots are some amount of liberty and ability to consent or not consent.

benlandis	702977740484403200	2016-02-25T22:05:28	Announcing that tweets would be able to have 10K characters sounds like suddenly every tweet will BE 10K characters. Call it something else!
benlandis	702977428818259968	2016-02-25T22:04:14	Sure, have some option for making a 10K character thing that's visible on Twitter. But don't make that the standard TWEET. That sounds nuts.
benlandis	702976153942798336	2016-02-25T21:59:10	If I were Twitter, I would try to figure out what the optimal character limit would be for each alphabet (i.e. set of languages) used.
benlandis	702975410502389761	2016-02-25T21:56:13	140 characters is a little too short. If tweets could be a little longer, Twitter would be better to use while keeping what makes it Twitter

benlandis	681876235178225664	2015-12-29T16:35:37	Maybe our trippiest brain phenomena have been experienced most by spiritual or pseudosciencey types, as they're the most likely to believe?

benlandis	680136084269969408	2015-12-24T21:20:53	MeatPoptarts I don't think that's true. If we could accomplish *only* the stuff we all agree on, the world would improve greatly.
