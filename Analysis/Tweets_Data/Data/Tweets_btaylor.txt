btaylor	702874967138922496	2016-02-25T15:17:05	sirkkalap quip Hey, this should be available in all languages. Mind sending more info to support@quip.com so we can fix your problem?
btaylor	702874601206878208	2016-02-25T15:15:38	If you haven't tried Quip yet, it's easier than ever to get started with our new design: 
btaylor	702874286860558336	2016-02-25T15:14:23	Great new design for Quip today. In Quip, content is communication. We have a name for that now: living documents.

btaylor	700726338043285504	2016-02-19T16:59:12	subbob Quip's social features make the experience completely different than related products: you can work on shared docs w/o using email.
btaylor	700726085453873152	2016-02-19T16:58:12	subbob We aren't a chat product. With Quip, you create living documents (docs, spreadsheets, checklists) to collaborate w/ your team.

btaylor	700006267910123520	2016-02-17T17:17:54	Wrote up how quip's desktop app avoids that "webby" incremental rendering feeling during startup: 
btaylor	699978598254383106	2016-02-17T15:27:57	Jal60 It is more nuanced. Backdoor mechanism to comply with court order puts millions of others at risk. No obvious recent precedent.
btaylor	699976848545939456	2016-02-17T15:21:00	Impressed and relieved Apple is taking a stand against encryption backdoors. Silicon Valley stands with Apple.

btaylor	698208900575678465	2016-02-12T18:15:48	This Pop quote about the Warriors from ESPNSteinLine's piece is the highest praise I can think of in hoops.

btaylor	698024178578956289	2016-02-12T06:01:47	sean_a_rose But no doubt we will be
btaylor	698024086446813189	2016-02-12T06:01:25	sean_a_rose The litmus test for me is, given specialized / unique product feature like that, can I use an AI API to power it? Not there yet
btaylor	698023894418980865	2016-02-12T06:00:39	sean_a_rose Definitely promising, but still specialized (image recognition). Example ML use case at FriendFeed, was "recommend friends"
btaylor	698022609330417664	2016-02-12T05:55:33	3/3 Enabling non-expert programmers to leverage AI would be truly disruptive. Hopefully we can all experience before robots kill us all.
btaylor	698022563901890562	2016-02-12T05:55:22	2/3 As unsupervised learning becomes reality, excited for prospect of AI becoming mainstream API. Like GPS/camera, enables new class of apps
btaylor	698022532700483584	2016-02-12T05:55:15	1/3 In 10+ years of web services, used lots of supervised learning. Hard for non-experts like me to get feature selection and training right
btaylor	697830480398254081	2016-02-11T17:12:06	It's good, not bad IMO. Our culture absolutely needs celebrate scientific achievement outside of circle of experts.

btaylor	696059381192871936	2016-02-06T19:54:23	spitza davealevine Not if they inadvertently overwhelm their own stream and churn
btaylor	696058485948035072	2016-02-06T19:50:49	jayrosen_nyu I would call this a debate :) Agree not "last word," but some behavior significant: e.g., likelihood to continue using service
btaylor	696048716155715585	2016-02-06T19:12:00	UnstableFanPage davealevine no need to get nasty. David is a friend of mine and we are having a healthy debate
btaylor	696037873171111936	2016-02-06T18:28:55	SaunderSchroed AustenAllred Twitter's main issues are onboarding and retention, not monetization. Growth drives monetization in social.
btaylor	696015477856833536	2016-02-06T16:59:55	rabois I think "ranking" is red herring. Root difference between networks is follower model vs. friends model, not lack of filtering
btaylor	696015080480231424	2016-02-06T16:58:21	patrickc It's been said in subsequent tweets, but "algorithmic" can be sequentially ordered and real-time - just not 100% of content
btaylor	695997421986324480	2016-02-06T15:48:11	davealevine You think you want what you are getting, but I don't think your perception of algorithmic is realistic, even for yourself.
btaylor	695997173054373889	2016-02-06T15:47:11	davealevine I will bet you a Quip coffee mug that 12 months after Twitter goes algorithmic, you personally use that view more.
btaylor	695996598589861888	2016-02-06T15:44:54	mathewi And if Twitter ranks, they are probably going to make it the default view but have a button to still see unfiltered. So just better
btaylor	695996333392408576	2016-02-06T15:43:51	mathewi In my time, we measured everything from interactions to likelihood to use the product weeks later. Can't recall a metric went down
btaylor	695995885252059136	2016-02-06T15:42:04	davealevine Experience of unfiltered does not scale with number of connections. Putting burden of filtering on user a losing approach.
btaylor	695994817956818944	2016-02-06T15:37:50	Algorithmic feed was always the thing people said they didn't want but demonstrated they did via every conceivable metric. It's just better.

btaylor	695676999155585025	2016-02-05T18:34:56	jtaby quip So your built-in Helvetica w/ weight medium is corrupted, or browser bug. My first recommendation is: 
btaylor	695676040266383360	2016-02-05T18:31:07	jtaby quip happens in other apps, like Photoshop or TextEdit? Browsers have lot of specialized font fallback code for unicode [2/2]
