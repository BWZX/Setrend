haralabob	726246629930618880	2016-04-30T03:07:44	Looks like he went 4 rounds with olivierbusquet 
haralabob	726239742346547200	2016-04-30T02:40:22	Way to give purple shirt man the recognition he craves so much.
haralabob	726239030917079040	2016-04-30T02:37:32	Ridiculous.
haralabob	726238575667347459	2016-04-30T02:35:43	Some guys just have it in them to never shy away from the moment. Wade is definitely one of those guys.
haralabob	726238397594013697	2016-04-30T02:35:01	Wade is like bizarro Kyle Lowry.
haralabob	726236863560835073	2016-04-30T02:28:55	So many bad calls.  
haralabob	726236353655099392	2016-04-30T02:26:54	Some of these fouls on both ends are just crazy.
haralabob	726235851949260804	2016-04-30T02:24:54	Ya. I like the hire.  
haralabob	726235433290571776	2016-04-30T02:23:14	Probably not 100% ready but is smart and will improve.  Also a better option than retreads that don’t deserve a shot 
haralabob	726234768417783808	2016-04-30T02:20:36	DeMar DeRozan is a career 37.2% shooter in the playoffs. With a career usage rating of 28.6. That's a tough combo.
haralabob	726233970552262658	2016-04-30T02:17:26	Ya safe to say I don’t want this guy trying to play with 5 fouls without a few mins to chill.  
haralabob	726233737877413888	2016-04-30T02:16:30	Great call from Mjax - would have been even better if he outlined Big Al as the problem in Hornets PNR defense
haralabob	726233269151391745	2016-04-30T02:14:38	Chris Bosh calming down/coaching Hassan Whiteside on the sideline. 
haralabob	726233298817699840	2016-04-30T02:14:45	They are gonna bring him back soon, I think good to get a head case like him a few mins and some coaching.  
haralabob	726233146296029184	2016-04-30T02:14:09	Whiteside is gonna need every dollar of that 20m for his lifetime therapy costs.
haralabob	726232382278385664	2016-04-30T02:11:07	I was a skycap at YWG 
haralabob	726232062420623361	2016-04-30T02:09:51	Whiteside's on ball D = Rudy Gay's O: seems like it should be good but it really ain't.
haralabob	726231842387550209	2016-04-30T02:08:58	Deng has been magnificent today.
haralabob	726230917048614912	2016-04-30T02:05:17	Play him when Big Al is out there, Whiteside should play vs Zeller as much as possible.  
haralabob	726230814716006401	2016-04-30T02:04:53	Those s were just from this game.  
haralabob	726230657408585728	2016-04-30T02:04:16	Spo has shit the bed this game. Not sure why Haslem would be out there when Big Al is sitting.
haralabob	726230362880356352	2016-04-30T02:03:05	Clifford is all around awesome. Great coach, great interviews, great pressers, great game to game adjustments.  
haralabob	726229963981082624	2016-04-30T02:01:30	In JB’s defense I’m not sure he can count to 5.  
haralabob	726229742786088960	2016-04-30T02:00:38	Its G7 buddy, if he’s alive there is no limit.  
haralabob	726229372131262468	2016-04-30T01:59:09	Presented without comment 
haralabob	726228687755055104	2016-04-30T01:56:26	PG13 has scored 1.5ppp with DMC out, .85ppp with DMC in. DMC has to play every minute PG plays.
haralabob	726227314724507648	2016-04-30T01:50:59	How can you watch Green play and think he’s comfortable right now? He looks nervous as fuck.
haralabob	726226878332293120	2016-04-30T01:49:15	Solomon Hill is gonna get paid.
haralabob	726226443391385601	2016-04-30T01:47:31	If there was any player in the league that rivals Beasley’s ability to score when a game is out of reach its Green. He’s not a real player
haralabob	726226210607517696	2016-04-30T01:46:35	Absolutely hate Spo’s decision to play Gerald Green.
haralabob	726226116034367489	2016-04-30T01:46:13	Wasn’t intimating that he’s playing bad bc he’s out of shape. Was just curious.  
haralabob	726225529150541824	2016-04-30T01:43:53	Would be curious to see Lowry’s weight and body fat % now vs the beginning of the season. Doesn’t look as fit as earlier in the year

haralabob	726222921870495744	2016-04-30T01:33:31	Can’t have any PG out there without DMC to guard him. This won’t end well.
haralabob	726222584036134912	2016-04-30T01:32:11	My Raps 4q lineup right now would be Joseph, Powell, DMC, Patterson and Biz.
haralabob	726221973223780353	2016-04-30T01:29:45	Raps would be getting smoked if not for their OREBs. They’ve scored 17 pts off of O boards.
haralabob	726221509996384256	2016-04-30T01:27:55	Drives me crazy when raptors run a "play" that ends up with Derozan shooting a loooong 2. RTZ WeTheNorth
haralabob	726220660847050752	2016-04-30T01:24:32	Have ragged on Casey but Vogels infatuation with Rodney Stuckey has been interesting.
haralabob	726219535347503105	2016-04-30T01:20:04	Can’t wait to see what lineups Casey rolls out in the 4q. Should be interesting.

haralabob	726218385235824641	2016-04-30T01:15:30	Monta Ellis transition decision maker extraordinaire.
haralabob	726217460391796736	2016-04-30T01:11:49	What a horribly officiated game in Indy, each team taking turns getting into the bonus early.
haralabob	726217235082125312	2016-04-30T01:10:55	He’s just a smarter defender.  
haralabob	726217128278380544	2016-04-30T01:10:30	Yes! 
haralabob	726216899474915328	2016-04-30T01:09:35	Stephanie Ready. she’s really good  
haralabob	726216763101319168	2016-04-30T01:09:03	I know it was precipitated by foul trouble, but I like Haslem in there go check Jefferson.
haralabob	726216366211084289	2016-04-30T01:07:28	Doris Burke should get JVG's spot.  
haralabob	726215929625976832	2016-04-30T01:05:44	Just realized that if JVG gets the Rockets job Jon Barry may move up the ladder. Dear god no.
haralabob	726214604985081857	2016-04-30T01:00:28	A little late but Lowry passing up that wide open corner 3 wasn’t a good look.
haralabob	726213526751158272	2016-04-30T00:56:11	I may also try Winslow on Kemba as well - in the other games DMC has been outstanding staying with PG
haralabob	726212777375862784	2016-04-30T00:53:13	Winslow has done a terrific job guarding Lin.
haralabob	725760678238126080	2016-04-28T18:56:44	Steven Adams explains how Duncan dropped 20 on him just by being nice &amp; why Adams stopped talking to him after. 
haralabob	725737651932778496	2016-04-28T17:25:14	No chance they'd beat okc.  
haralabob	725595206872010753	2016-04-28T07:59:12	TheLegend0188 I bet Houston once + 10 when curry was questionable and backdoored it. Would never bet them again.

haralabob	725551396129542144	2016-04-28T05:05:07	Everyone loves the random camera work and overhead shots that miss half the action bestinthebiz 
haralabob	725549653438115844	2016-04-28T04:58:12	Finally the Howard and Capela front court I’ve been waiting for!  
haralabob	725548808357158912	2016-04-28T04:54:50	Not sure thats tradition.  
haralabob	725547886885371904	2016-04-28T04:51:10	foolishness 
haralabob	725546943489970176	2016-04-28T04:47:25	He needs guys that can actually hit the wide open 3s he creates.  
haralabob	725544210280144896	2016-04-28T04:36:34	Does Doc know they are down 8 and not 80?
haralabob	725544053094375424	2016-04-28T04:35:56	Kudos to JBB for sticking with Brewer, his faith and patience has finally paid off.  
haralabob	725538536863227904	2016-04-28T04:14:01	That was one of the most ridic shooting fouls I’ve seen Harden draw. Huh?
haralabob	725536383641726976	2016-04-28T04:05:28	This isn't how reliability works.  
haralabob	725534304407834624	2016-04-28T03:57:12	Lillard going against CP3 in iso was tough though.  
haralabob	725533822662656001	2016-04-28T03:55:17	Probably. Can’t recall tbh.  
haralabob	725532995608805376	2016-04-28T03:52:00	They don’t count. But ya them too.  
haralabob	725532778591358976	2016-04-28T03:51:08	Maybe he means the fact nobody is lined up to rebound (like flagrant and clear paths)  
haralabob	725532642465206272	2016-04-28T03:50:36	Not sure. But they could definitely of beaten Dallas too if thats any consolation to the Rockets.  
haralabob	725532105569128450	2016-04-28T03:48:28	It was incredibly obvious he meant something that he didn’t actually say. Why not include Clear Path and flagrants? 
haralabob	725531850941280256	2016-04-28T03:47:27	Do you mean technical free throws percentage vs regular for the same players? Or do you mean just as whole?

haralabob	725531213620989952	2016-04-28T03:44:55	You got a bet.  
haralabob	725530640691650560	2016-04-28T03:42:39	If I’m Houston I’m asking for permission to talk to Luke Walton - like right now, at halftime. See if he can coach Rox the rest of the way.
haralabob	725530218446872576	2016-04-28T03:40:58	cuckoo.  
haralabob	725530132945870848	2016-04-28T03:40:38	haralabob lol well if its any consolation theres dummies in my mentions who think i care about anything but jokes at this point.
haralabob	725529859980664832	2016-04-28T03:39:32	I never thought I’d feel empathy for a guy who made the decision to date a Kardashian but here we are.  
haralabob	725529491741806592	2016-04-28T03:38:05	Not sure how anyone can rag on Harden. He’s carrying the team in a ridiculous situation.  
haralabob	725528885396410368	2016-04-28T03:35:40	Why not play the backup C some or are they trying to alienate him too? 
haralabob	725528508471119872	2016-04-28T03:34:10	Brewer is someone who crashes the boards on O yet never gets a rebound, leaks out in transition every play but never scores. Its mad.
haralabob	725528244502536192	2016-04-28T03:33:07	Probably less than the times I say “WTF” at something JBB does.  
haralabob	725527731350474752	2016-04-28T03:31:05	Dude they played him 40 mins straight last game. He really has no clue.  
haralabob	725527120672395264	2016-04-28T03:28:39	haralabob Can your friend count to 24? Cuz that's only as high as he needs to
haralabob	725526820569886721	2016-04-28T03:27:28	Is it possible the players don’t care because they realize he’s a terrible unqualified coach? 
haralabob	725526632602165248	2016-04-28T03:26:43	What is Corey Brewer shooting in this series? Asking for a friend.
haralabob	725526275494936576	2016-04-28T03:25:18	Its really remarkable seeing a coaches like Clifford,  Spo and Doc prepare their team to play then contrasting it with JBB.
haralabob	725524039104643072	2016-04-28T03:16:25	J.B. Bickerstaff looking a little like when the substitute teacher gets overwhelmed and assigns busy work to just get through the period
haralabob	725524469331152896	2016-04-28T03:18:07	Look at this lineup right now, he has Brewer paired with Beasley. (I have no bet, just blown away at how bad he is)
haralabob	725524033308098560	2016-04-28T03:16:23	Byron doesn’t do anything tho, he just grumble grumble “man up” JBB actually is worse bc he tries.  
haralabob	725523818819760128	2016-04-28T03:15:32	Dude played Harden 40 straight mins to start a game - started Brewer in G1. JBB for life.
haralabob	725523419287150592	2016-04-28T03:13:57	Been biting my tongue on him a lot bc its obv a tough team to coach, but man he has zero clue what to do. Their gameplan nightly stinks too
haralabob	725523135181783040	2016-04-28T03:12:49	JBB is one of the worst coaches I have seen, not even sure what he’s thinking. Thats when he tries to hack?When it gives other team 2 for 1?
haralabob	725141813783318529	2016-04-27T01:57:35	tomediasports When someone offers me 10m a year.

haralabob	725124068576493568	2016-04-27T00:47:04	Raps may want to sub out one of Powell, DDR, Lowry or COJO for some rebounding.
haralabob	725123389636116480	2016-04-27T00:44:22	He’s not ready to be a head coach. He’s been embarrassing this year.  
haralabob	725122524963557376	2016-04-27T00:40:56	Hate that call, if the bucket went in Kennedy wouldn’t have made the call. It was a clear foul, why does it matter if it goes in?
haralabob	725121911089451008	2016-04-27T00:38:30	Rockets transition defense started to fall apart largely bc Harden refused (was exhausted) to get back in 3q. Hadn’t come out of game yet
haralabob	725121664799899648	2016-04-27T00:37:31	Reminds me Bickerstaff (who’s been far and away the the worst coach this playoffs) played Harden~40 straight mins 
haralabob	725121175660146688	2016-04-27T00:35:35	Raps basically only need to play 3 bigs, JV, PPat and Biz, then start Powell and PPat and they are set.
haralabob	725120978007785474	2016-04-27T00:34:47	Nope. Seems like their rotation finally taking shape.  
haralabob	725119959026819073	2016-04-27T00:30:44	Cory Joseph needs to play more as well. He’s been fantastic and has the playoff experience (winning) the other Raps lack.
haralabob	725119442351472642	2016-04-27T00:28:41	awesome.  
haralabob	725119280187105280	2016-04-27T00:28:03	He made some good adjustments to get them the lead, definitely went too long with bench tho in 2q and now.  
haralabob	725118955363422209	2016-04-27T00:26:45	Powell has been outstanding in limited minute tonight.
haralabob	725096285263503360	2016-04-26T22:56:40	How many wide open 3s have the Pacers gotten from simple dribble penetration since T. Ross checked in?
haralabob	725095756290478080	2016-04-26T22:54:34	I’ll say this about Vogel, he’s quite the optimist
haralabob	725095406678474753	2016-04-26T22:53:11	Did Ty Lawson just punt?
haralabob	725095010710876160	2016-04-26T22:51:36	haralabob Meanwhile these no calls. Lol 
haralabob	725095021444239361	2016-04-26T22:51:39	Staying away from PG probably more important.

haralabob	724421173992255489	2016-04-25T02:14:01	Good individual scorer, not so good at much else.  
haralabob	724420943485923328	2016-04-25T02:13:06	Drummond postups when he has 0 or 1 feet in the paint vs 2 feet in the paint. Quite the contrast.
haralabob	724402810003955713	2016-04-25T01:01:03	Its a lot harder to run a decent play with limited time from a SLOB 
haralabob	724399516095381504	2016-04-25T00:47:57	Jerebko is guarding Horford and Smart is guarding Millsap, they don’t have to be giants.  
haralabob	724399414597419008	2016-04-25T00:47:33	One of he the disadvantages of having one of Millsap and Horford out extended to the 3pt line on Offense
haralabob	724399111953227776	2016-04-25T00:46:21	Not sure how Horford and Millsap aren’t owning the glass vs this Small Celts team.
haralabob	724397163749335040	2016-04-25T00:38:37	What a clever adjustment having Smart guard Millsap.
haralabob	724396281724960768	2016-04-25T00:35:06	1. You waited too long bc they had a foul to give.  2. Huh? 3. Too funny.
haralabob	724396197901795328	2016-04-25T00:34:46	LOL.
haralabob	724102474651471872	2016-04-24T05:07:37	Is very good at her job.  
haralabob	724101712508649472	2016-04-24T05:04:36	because it gives you a better chance of winning? 
haralabob	724100777204031489	2016-04-24T05:00:53	Giving up 1.33 vs this 5 man unit though  
haralabob	724099809586487298	2016-04-24T04:57:02	Not hacking here seems odd.
haralabob	724098809031065601	2016-04-24T04:53:03	Having CP3 at the 1 and DJ at the 5 is an embarrassment of defensive riches.
haralabob	724098654856830976	2016-04-24T04:52:27	DJ is all over the place on D
haralabob	724094965068890114	2016-04-24T04:37:47	haralabob  Bob, I’d like to take a minute and apologize to you.  I thought Jeff Green was a decent pickup and you laughed.   I get it now.
haralabob	724093608765202432	2016-04-24T04:32:23	Si Senor.  
haralabob	724093003753648128	2016-04-24T04:29:59	haralabob after he took that last shot I thought I could hear you moan and topple over.
haralabob	724092957171699712	2016-04-24T04:29:48	Also has 2 turnovers so there’s that.
haralabob	724092868105633792	2016-04-24T04:29:27	Kaman is 2-5 with 0 rebounds but hey he’s really the key to unlocking that midrange.
haralabob	724090533912539141	2016-04-24T04:20:10	At some point the Clippers need to accept that NBA officiating isn't personal. Isn't a criminal conspiracy. Isn't extrajudicial. It just is.
haralabob	724081217096699905	2016-04-24T03:43:09	Love when you're waiting for the bathroom and a dude rushes past you and pushes on the door like you didn't think to try that
haralabob	724075482698797056	2016-04-24T03:20:22	Also airballed one and hasn’t stopped dribble penetration once from a Clipper guard.  
haralabob	724074785567727616	2016-04-24T03:17:36	I’m just blown away that Kaman is playing this many minutes for Stotts.
haralabob	724070552281849856	2016-04-24T03:00:46	Refs could call Plumlee for a defensive 8 seconds call on almost all of these possessions.

haralabob	723996774805839872	2016-04-23T22:07:36	Love how Whiteside goes straight to the bench after picking up 2 fouls.
haralabob	723990450957209601	2016-04-23T21:42:29	all of the above imo.  
haralabob	723697644434952192	2016-04-23T02:18:58	Doesn’t enter into the top 20 dumb decisions Mike Scott has made. “Ya I’d love an emoji tattoo” Drug ride? Fun!" 
haralabob	723631469957009409	2016-04-22T21:56:01	I think to a large extent the foul disparity was out of their control and a function of the score  
haralabob	723628772402958336	2016-04-22T21:45:18	This is awesome. RC could moonlight  as a lawyer. 
haralabob	723625712817606656	2016-04-22T21:33:08	Home team  went 2-0 since I tweeted out the streak.  
haralabob	723310341287895041	2016-04-22T00:39:58	Also not sure if he realizes a Cory Brewer 3 pt shot is basically a turnover  
haralabob	723309823811407873	2016-04-22T00:37:55	AdamSpolane haralabob in other words. He wants all the offense run through Harden, and no one else....It's Harden Ball.
haralabob	723310000488108032	2016-04-22T00:38:37	Great job asking. Turnovers were up but they still managed to score 10 pts / 100 poss more than the opponent.  
haralabob	723298274522746880	2016-04-21T23:52:01	Is the alternative that he knows how to coach? If thats the case you are right, I never state the alternative.  
haralabob	723296931791818752	2016-04-21T23:46:41	Is this real life? 
haralabob	723295496534523904	2016-04-21T23:40:59	He hasn't guarded Dirk good in 4 years.  
haralabob	723295312811429888	2016-04-21T23:40:15	Gotta make sure you protect the paint against this uber athletic Mavs team who uses 20 secs to get into their O.  
haralabob	723295171190738945	2016-04-21T23:39:41	There has been a lot of great coaching this playoffs, I've definitely mentioned more + than - since playoffs started 
haralabob	723295009001218048	2016-04-21T23:39:02	And why wouldn't he make an offensive sub and get Morrow or RWB (or Payne) on this last possession? NC in for offense? God he's clueless.
haralabob	723294287773851650	2016-04-21T23:36:11	We aren't in 2011 anymore.  
haralabob	723294229393379328	2016-04-21T23:35:57	Seriously there are 10 or so instances a game where I have no idea why Billy Donovan is playing a given 5 man lineup.
haralabob	723294007523041281	2016-04-21T23:35:04	Adams, Kanter, Ibaka, Durant, all can play the 4. Not sure I understand the need to play Collison this much.
haralabob	723288436879183872	2016-04-21T23:12:56	Ya I disagree.  
haralabob	723215865995350017	2016-04-21T18:24:33	Not sure they could do much else, I was impressed with the offensive gameplan Stotts employed.  
haralabob	723209962009202688	2016-04-21T18:01:06	RationaIBias I do both. Good rule for me is if I’m not gonna live there  or keep the property for &gt;7 years I am better off renting.
haralabob	723208829744242688	2016-04-21T17:56:36	Next house I rent, I am turning the master bedroom into a hair salon in honor of Prince.
haralabob	723201454840897536	2016-04-21T17:27:17	Only now do we know what it sounds like When Doves Cry — the absence of music from loss of The Artist. RIP Prince (1958-2016)
haralabob	723194395118297089	2016-04-21T16:59:14	Miami scored 1.52 per unguarded shot the other day. 1.18 on unguarded long 2s.
haralabob	723193507641364482	2016-04-21T16:55:43	They’d get boarded to death.  
haralabob	723193009341227008	2016-04-21T16:53:44	Hornets have one adv, Batum over Johnson and thats handled when Miami switches JJ off of him.
haralabob	723192837110538240	2016-04-21T16:53:03	So while its fine to say “we just didn’t stop middle” you need to consider their base concepts aren’t equip. to handle Miami’s athletic adv.
haralabob	723192551755243520	2016-04-21T16:51:55	I loved the Clifford quote, one of the things he may want to consider though is way over matched athletically 
haralabob	723186042300325889	2016-04-21T16:26:03	When was the last time Byron Scott coached a team that wasn’t bottom 5 in defensive efficiency?
haralabob	723185864566669313	2016-04-21T16:25:20	pot meet kettle.  
haralabob	723013681257172992	2016-04-21T05:01:09	CP3 has completely smothered Lillard so far this series.
haralabob	723012287926149120	2016-04-21T04:55:37	Has taken large chunks of the game off on defense too.  
haralabob	723011737281159169	2016-04-21T04:53:25	He made a great dunk, is a long way from being back.  
haralabob	723010414615752706	2016-04-21T04:48:10	They really have, they’ve actually been a lot sharper than the starters have (save DJ and CP3) 
haralabob	723010218473332743	2016-04-21T04:47:23	If you watched G1 you’d have noticed how they blitzed Dame and CJ on every PNR 
haralabob	723009259709964288	2016-04-21T04:43:35	Doc and the Clips coaches have done a pretty ridiculously good job of putting together a defensive gameplan vs this Blazers team.
haralabob	723006742934654979	2016-04-21T04:33:34	Can’t wait for Marv to lay his next gem on us. Teams that score more points than their opponent win the game.
haralabob	723006273826906112	2016-04-21T04:31:43	Shocking teams win more games when they employ XYZ tactic when leading vs trailing.
haralabob	723005789086982144	2016-04-21T04:29:47	well, gotta love Rooks confidence.  
haralabob	722995653673000961	2016-04-21T03:49:31	Way to hold that follow through DJ, don’t go for the ball that landed one foot in front of you.
haralabob	722995482142724096	2016-04-21T03:48:50	stumbled after getting fouled, missed both ft’s. Yep put a nail in the coffin. Its over.  
haralabob	722985799705194497	2016-04-21T03:10:21	More importantly he could hit an above the break 3. Something nobody else has been able to do so far.  
haralabob	722985559983939585	2016-04-21T03:09:24	Blake looks lazy out there, amazing how effective he can be even when he’s clearly not giving his all (or can’t)
haralabob	722984863372988417	2016-04-21T03:06:38	Was their fastest played Q on offense by far.  
haralabob	722984274941464576	2016-04-21T03:04:18	Good point. Probably love the way he handled the ball Draymond Green style when Clips trapped PNR 
haralabob	722983873026482176	2016-04-21T03:02:42	hack a for sure.

haralabob	722980513040855041	2016-04-21T02:49:21	He didn’t play the last 5 mins. What more do you want? We are predicting freak injuries in mins 1-43 now? 
haralabob	722978989120212993	2016-04-21T02:43:17	Not to mention they went on most  big runs with him in the game. He rests its likely 7pt game and has to close 
haralabob	722977939126505472	2016-04-21T02:39:07	This is what you play for all year, I don’t see the point in resting in the playoffs. Will never hear me tout rest.  
haralabob	722977445607968768	2016-04-21T02:37:09	Easiest way to rest in the playoffs is to avoid playing unnecessary games.  
haralabob	722976691329486848	2016-04-21T02:34:10	They wouldn’t have had this big of a lead if he rested more in the 2H (he hasn’t played the whole 2H) 
haralabob	722976219503816704	2016-04-21T02:32:17	They were up 2 at the half and trailed after 1.  
haralabob	722974030861467648	2016-04-21T02:23:35	Would love the transcript of this.  
haralabob	722972956817657857	2016-04-21T02:19:19	Detroit playing considerably faster than CLE is - their lack of depth (and the fact they are a big underdog) should = slower pace.
haralabob	722970660817903616	2016-04-21T02:10:12	Can’t handle the Cavs traps nor can he guard anyone on the other end.  
haralabob	722970100060446720	2016-04-21T02:07:58	Blake can’t even get open to receive a simple inbounds pass.
haralabob	722969127120310272	2016-04-21T02:04:06	Steve Blake is killing the Pistons.
haralabob	722962959526318081	2016-04-21T01:39:36	Not to take anything away from Stanley, but there are very few young players I’d take over Justise.  
haralabob	722962455589068800	2016-04-21T01:37:36	SVG is one of the very best coaches in the game. He’s top top for sure.  
haralabob	722962272503533569	2016-04-21T01:36:52	Multiple dribble handoffs and floppy action just to get into a Wade postup with 7 secs on the shotclock.  
haralabob	722961875663646721	2016-04-21T01:35:17	If they had Bosh they probably wouldn’t have figured out this style though.  
haralabob	722961741039079425	2016-04-21T01:34:45	Tweeted about this earlier, he’s completely reworked the offense. Really love how they play.  
haralabob	722961563074752514	2016-04-21T01:34:03	Deng/Justise have done a better job of protecting the paint on the PNR than HW has this game. Gives Miami some options.
haralabob	722960280372670464	2016-04-21T01:28:57	Great adjustment from Spo going with Winslow at the 5. Turned the game around.
haralabob	722947727894716420	2016-04-21T00:39:04	He'd be able to call a foul on all those leaning foul shots into the defender in pickup tho.  
haralabob	722945413968457728	2016-04-21T00:29:53	That last CHA possession looked like a video game glitch. OREB sliders set to 100%
haralabob	722944031085432832	2016-04-21T00:24:23	thats actually a really good idea. If you follow both you get both. If you don't you miss all the pbp drivel.  
haralabob	722943892098826240	2016-04-21T00:23:50	Woah Bennett Salvatore is now the director of NBAs officiating development? That explains a lot.
haralabob	722943613622206464	2016-04-21T00:22:43	hohendorf i'm sure he's broken the odd injury alert at some point. But unfollowed him now.
haralabob	722943074108907520	2016-04-21T00:20:35	.aejonesleggo but if the guy is a good follow, you have to go back and unmute them after the game is over. Not efficient.
haralabob	722942839399845888	2016-04-21T00:19:39	Twitter really needs a filter so that you can unfollow otherwise good follows during their play by play binges.
haralabob	722942414516826112	2016-04-21T00:17:57	Wonder what Drummond would shoot if he tried to bank every FT.
haralabob	722941020057518081	2016-04-21T00:12:25	Deng, Dragic, Johnson, Richardson aren't bad when wide open.  
haralabob	722940536127156224	2016-04-21T00:10:30	Another wide open 3 for Miami.
haralabob	722940007334428672	2016-04-21T00:08:23	Way too many unguarded 3s.  
haralabob	722939402293522432	2016-04-21T00:05:59	albertms6 Thats shocked me as well. Not sure. tbh.
haralabob	722936262211014656	2016-04-20T23:53:31	You have to appreciate him 4 what he is a highlight player. He'll give you a highlight or 3 a night.But he's no DPOY 
haralabob	722934272055721984	2016-04-20T23:45:36	He's been unreal. He was under the basket with no angle and he called a "kick" when the ball bounced of Amare's knee 
haralabob	722933888943841280	2016-04-20T23:44:05	Courtney Kirkland has had himself a hell of a game so far for the Hornets.
haralabob	722932770994069508	2016-04-20T23:39:38	Fouls.

haralabob	722928808194633729	2016-04-20T23:23:53	He definitely has some negatives thats for sure.  
haralabob	722928308447547396	2016-04-20T23:21:54	Man what a block.
haralabob	722927252019748864	2016-04-20T23:17:42	btw we are 3 mins in and Clifford has already made some great adjustments. Fronting Whiteside, using Zeller to get HW out of the paint
haralabob	722927016522215425	2016-04-20T23:16:46	Hornets have to be careful getting Joe Johnson in foul trouble. Winslow a clear upgrade for Heat.
haralabob	722897672462409728	2016-04-20T21:20:10	Thought it was poor form for ZachLowe_NBA to joke about wanting some of Thibs' money when he's already swimming in that MeUndies cash.
haralabob	722892711045410816	2016-04-20T21:00:27	KevinHobster cool story.
haralabob	722891653380329474	2016-04-20T20:56:15	RWB does seem like a tough guy to interview though.

haralabob	722460436084301825	2016-04-19T16:22:45	Even doing something like having RWB go to opposite corner and having Morrow cut to corner on KDs side would help 
haralabob	722292709566722048	2016-04-19T05:16:16	They made it to WCF last year with nearly the same roster.  
haralabob	722292240777748480	2016-04-19T05:14:24	The first memo should be about how raw plus minus isn’t analytics. Its a counting stat.  
haralabob	722292105129779200	2016-04-19T05:13:52	Legit laughing.  
haralabob	722291622373818368	2016-04-19T05:11:56	Can’t get behind the logjam of guys they’ve played at the 4 including Brewer/Ariza/Josh Smith and KJ 
haralabob	722291376256262146	2016-04-19T05:10:58	This isn’t an analytic team. There is no way any analytics would support how their coach coaches.  
haralabob	722291138955116544	2016-04-19T05:10:01	Yep he brought in Beasley, who then gave his guy the baseline and forgot they have no C in the game.
haralabob	722290533113004032	2016-04-19T05:07:37	Nah, we’ll go with Beasley.
haralabob	722290330666536960	2016-04-19T05:06:48	Very fitting that Mike Fratello who strangled the hell out of his teams offense isn’t a fan of analytics. First to 75 wins. Fratello Law.
haralabob	722290008476913664	2016-04-19T05:05:32	Its gonna take Howard getting 6 fouls for this coach to put CC in for him.
haralabob	722289531366453248	2016-04-19T05:03:38	Dwight Howard is a joke guys, sorry.
haralabob	722288843190181889	2016-04-19T05:00:54	Get out and run, but don’t be in a rush. Got it.
haralabob	722285221668741120	2016-04-19T04:46:30	For real. Not sure how anyone could have watched that 1H and not noticed how lazy / low energy DH played.  
haralabob	722280605208043521	2016-04-19T04:28:10	The one prior to that was pretty amazing too. It was like a Volleyball set.  
haralabob	722279543780679680	2016-04-19T04:23:57	He’s barely trying out there and laughing and smiling the whole time (albeit somewhat nervously)  
haralabob	722279235193188352	2016-04-19T04:22:43	My favorite coaching moment, they take out DH so they could hack Bogut. Bogut comes out and JBB plays 2 mins without a C or PF
haralabob	722279104884580353	2016-04-19T04:22:12	Josh Smith also looked like he was busting his ass out there, he’s only played 33 possessions.

haralabob	722278365890084866	2016-04-19T04:19:16	Such a missed opportunity for the Rockets.
haralabob	722277961185910784	2016-04-19T04:17:39	This is amazing. How doesn’t Clint Capela see the floor? Howard is barely even trying out there (or able to move)
haralabob	722259302061182976	2016-04-19T03:03:31	Bogut isn’t giving him an inch.

haralabob	722258482783629312	2016-04-19T03:00:15	Might take the layup over a Barbosa corner 3.

haralabob	722255997796921344	2016-04-19T02:50:23	I’ve seen more moving screens called tonight than I have in the last 1.5 months of the regular season.
haralabob	722255367137157120	2016-04-19T02:47:53	This is the playoffs vs an elite defensive coach. You can’t just show up with no offense even w/ KD and RWB 
haralabob	722254928706580480	2016-04-19T02:46:08	Thats some pretty crazy vision/awareness/mental clock.  
haralabob	722254306527719424	2016-04-19T02:43:40	Royce has Billy Donovans coaching strategy neural netted.

haralabob	722253706754809856	2016-04-19T02:41:17	Not only did they lose to a 14 point underdog, but for 10 seconds they thought they won. Rough night.
haralabob	722252622787321856	2016-04-19T02:36:58	haralabob give it to him that was a nice play drawn up
haralabob	722251802498899968	2016-04-19T02:33:43	This is hilarious execution from OKC. If you aren’t even going to pretend to run a play. At least try and space the side KD is on.
haralabob	722251546524786689	2016-04-19T02:32:42	haralabob I don't know if I would've trusted Billy Donovan to mail in my taxes today.
haralabob	722251358376632320	2016-04-19T02:31:57	Gotta play the percentages. He’s almost shooting 30% from 3.  
haralabob	722250227571376128	2016-04-19T02:27:27	The Thunder run late-game offense like they’re forced to give it to their opponents in discovery.
haralabob	722249006319951872	2016-04-19T02:22:36	If you are gonna run that play, at least have Morrow in the corner and not RWB. Makes it harder to double KD
haralabob	722248517939388416	2016-04-19T02:20:40	Dirk who is 105 just beat RWB down the court, RWB took a play off.
haralabob	722247712712708096	2016-04-19T02:17:28	
haralabob	722246994329149440	2016-04-19T02:14:36	Brooks Flustrates me, but I’d much rather him over Billy. Players loved Brooks.  
haralabob	722241658746580993	2016-04-19T01:53:24	Also Dallas’ go to play is that 1-4 Pick with Dirk, but that never works with Rondo bc they just doubled Dirk.  
haralabob	722241375484248069	2016-04-19T01:52:17	he’s facing a wall of Dallas defenders on every play. 
haralabob	722241018859393025	2016-04-19T01:50:52	Has more to do with Rondo not being able to run a half court offense. Felton and JJ definitely love to dribble.  
haralabob	722240743893442560	2016-04-19T01:49:46	Can anyone tell me what type of offense OKC is trying to run? So much standing around.
haralabob	722237052792610816	2016-04-19T01:35:06	Tonight should provide some insight into the true definition of lightyears
haralabob	722234997520732160	2016-04-19T01:26:56	This seems pretty ridiculous.  
haralabob	722233447842914304	2016-04-19T01:20:47	Looks to be in good shape. Its the playoffs timeouts are longer. I’d be willing to test him out at 35+ 
haralabob	722233003661897729	2016-04-19T01:19:01	How many mins do you think he should be playing? 
haralabob	722230050888679426	2016-04-19T01:07:17	PatPat is a +14 in 22 mins.
haralabob	722226938199158784	2016-04-19T00:54:55	Didn’t seem fineworthy.  
haralabob	722224433088212992	2016-04-19T00:44:57	Maybe they should give DDR the same tests.  
haralabob	722222581344919552	2016-04-19T00:37:36	The Danny Crawford-Mavs playoff history:  This trend ended right after this story was reported.

haralabob	722214333418082304	2016-04-19T00:04:49	Nah I was seated at my desk doing nothing. Just a bad connection or something.  
haralabob	722214018170007552	2016-04-19T00:03:34	Jonas got away with a clear offensive foul there.
haralabob	722213774455758848	2016-04-19T00:02:36	This is a great joke. Haven't heard this one yet. Well done.  
haralabob	722213673452736512	2016-04-19T00:02:12	God Derozan is so terrible defensively.
haralabob	722212185338871808	2016-04-18T23:56:17	At this point in case you were wondering DMC has no shot staying w/ PG or any1, just not  all the way back now. Has repeatedly lost his guy
haralabob	722211708710694912	2016-04-18T23:54:24	Don't mind playing DMC at the 4, but not when Ross is in at the 3. Not sure you can overcome that.
haralabob	722211277460770816	2016-04-18T23:52:41	What a strip from Joseph, just an amazing upgrade going from Vasquez and Lou to COJO.
haralabob	722210955048960001	2016-04-18T23:51:24	George back in, and so is DeMarre. Good stuff from Casey.

haralabob	722208090066583552	2016-04-18T23:40:01	The turnover was lovely though.  
haralabob	722205998983684097	2016-04-18T23:31:42	Should be pretty obvious right now how important those 3 early fouls on JV were the other day.
haralabob	722203916440502272	2016-04-18T23:23:26	There should be a rule that your team should have better raw D s when you are on the floor for you to win DPOY 
haralabob	722203713654226945	2016-04-18T23:22:37	PG has done a great job on DDR having Mahinmi at the rim has also helped. Has cut off a lot of DDR's drives.

haralabob	722196920181989376	2016-04-18T22:55:38	countryhatfield I'd get 0 fines. I have no temper.
haralabob	722196790942904321	2016-04-18T22:55:07	I'm probably letting DDR walk unless they get to the Finals regardless. Not maxing him out.  
haralabob	722196422678827008	2016-04-18T22:53:39	No.  
haralabob	722196369985810432	2016-04-18T22:53:27	Its the playoffs, this isn't hard. PatPat should play at least 33 mins so much easier to get him those mins w/ rest if he starts. RTZ
haralabob	722195897438765056	2016-04-18T22:51:34	Not starting PatPat forced him to play the last 3:55 of 1q and the entire 2q. Also played a 11min straight stint in the 2H. Its nonsense.
haralabob	722194828298047488	2016-04-18T22:47:19	I'd take $0 until we get to the ECF

haralabob	722193438465073152	2016-04-18T22:41:48	The playoffs haven't arrived until D.Casey fails to make an adjustment thats painfully obvious.
haralabob	722183980032724992	2016-04-18T22:04:13	No idea. PatPat clearly better, will play more mins, will be forced to play too many consecutive mins w/out rest 
haralabob	722179770058838017	2016-04-18T21:47:29	My favorite sneaky Foster call of the day - 
haralabob	722176737853906944	2016-04-18T21:35:26	I was just being snarky, getting JV post touches is definitely a good idea. But its not as key as starting PatPat 
haralabob	722176609575247872	2016-04-18T21:34:55	I actually am in favor of getting JV more post looks. I just couldn’t help myself with the snark. Much better than having DDR try to go v PG
haralabob	722175891162267648	2016-04-18T21:32:04	And you don’t think he’ll figure out DDR? You play Powell on him, then bring in DMC and put him on him too.  
haralabob	722175282753331200	2016-04-18T21:29:39	Just have Powell guard him. This isn’t hard.  
haralabob	722175095779659776	2016-04-18T21:28:54	Can’t take your offensive workhouse and have him guard the other teams best player. He’s not Paul George or Kawhi.
haralabob	722174691851444225	2016-04-18T21:27:18	The main issue for TOR was only playing PatPat and JV 5 mins together. PatPat should start. Powell should guard PG
haralabob	722174428067422208	2016-04-18T21:26:15	Understandable since he scored .67 points on layups, put-backs and dunks in the paint. Have to ride that efficiency. 
haralabob	722114654248370180	2016-04-18T17:28:44	Meanwhile, the Spurs would be well-served to let David West write their next free agency recruiting brochure: 
haralabob	721934026571800576	2016-04-18T05:30:59	Contrary to popular belief,  there is no rule that says you have to set a high screen.  
haralabob	721933588006985729	2016-04-18T05:29:14	And it was pretty obvious that was how the Clips were going to defend the High Screen.
haralabob	721933450609950720	2016-04-18T05:28:42	We’ll see what adjustments COY candidate Stotts comes up with to handle the Clips aggro doubles of the High Screen. Zero answer for it in G1

haralabob	721902291595304960	2016-04-18T03:24:53	He’s in a tough spot, brand new to being a HC. But haven’t been impressed.  
haralabob	721901917870231552	2016-04-18T03:23:24	He’s great.  
haralabob	721901794327011329	2016-04-18T03:22:54	Portland can get a lot of stuff moving to the basket and off ball misdirection. Clips are over pursuing a ton.
haralabob	721898383800029185	2016-04-18T03:09:21	Love this Clipper 5 man bench lineup. Yikes.
haralabob	721897016024956928	2016-04-18T03:03:55	Can’t do it 1-5 though. DJ and CP3 are too good defensively. Do it with the 4.

haralabob	721895747369574400	2016-04-18T02:58:53	Portland no answer to those PNR blitzes. May want to just stop running PNR with Lillard.
haralabob	721893203704619008	2016-04-18T02:48:46	Blazers have to fight a bit harder through these picks. Can’t happily switch Lillard onto Blake.
haralabob	721892408590409728	2016-04-18T02:45:36	Yes. LRMM has no offense.  
haralabob	721892054029086724	2016-04-18T02:44:12	I’d put Harkless on Blake and let Aminu guard JJ. Don’t think CJ can handle an offensive load and chase JJ around all those screens.
haralabob	721891841906384896	2016-04-18T02:43:21	So many cross matches in this game so far.
haralabob	721891652638367744	2016-04-18T02:42:36	I’ve never seen a guy miss a free throw that far to the side.
haralabob	721889649942073345	2016-04-18T02:34:39	Thing to watch in this PDX@LAC game, how often Clips blitz Lillard PNR and how much having Harkless at the 4 helps PDX when that happens
haralabob	721886839393673216	2016-04-18T02:23:29	Goran Dragic: "Coach did an amazing job. He told us they were going to blitz Joe Johnson &amp; myself." That led to ball moving to Deng.

haralabob	721832406991253504	2016-04-17T22:47:11	I also think if he has a few guys hit shots over him, he gets up the next possession regardless of who it is.  
haralabob	721832261746700290	2016-04-17T22:46:36	I've watched every Heat game since March 1. But thanks.  
haralabob	721831868643979264	2016-04-17T22:45:03	Ya I think thats probably it. But Zeller just blew by him.  
haralabob	721831497343193089	2016-04-17T22:43:34	Whiteside presses up on guys who aren't a threat from 3 (Zeller) sags on guys who are (Kemba, Batum etc). Such a bad decision maker.
haralabob	721829571339894784	2016-04-17T22:35:55	Would love to see him go wherever RWB and KD go when they leave OKC together.  
haralabob	721828839546970112	2016-04-17T22:33:00	Great adjustment by Heat staff putting Joe on Marvin.
haralabob	721828490903818242	2016-04-17T22:31:37	He'd matchup okay with Marvin Williams.  
haralabob	721828337803337730	2016-04-17T22:31:01	Yes.

haralabob	721827279735685120	2016-04-17T22:26:49	Wade's eyes got so big when he saw Jeremy Lin guarding him.

haralabob	721823079186366466	2016-04-17T22:10:07	Great 2 for 1 by Dragic.

haralabob	721821855498129408	2016-04-17T22:05:15	he guards 3s and 4s, they guard 1s and 2s. No comparison.

haralabob	721817406968954880	2016-04-17T21:47:35	If I'm Spo I think about putting Johnson on Williams and Deng on Batum. Don't think Joe J can handle Batum.
haralabob	721816918101864448	2016-04-17T21:45:38	Hated that they'd walk the ball to half court then use sets that took 10-15 secs to develop. They don't do that now 
haralabob	721815864635367424	2016-04-17T21:41:27	I disagreed with everything they did offensively early in the year. They made a lot of changes mid season.  
haralabob	721815584615190528	2016-04-17T21:40:20	dbschoemer Ha true. Was referring to Whiteside

haralabob	721815204049264640	2016-04-17T21:38:49	Can't really be sure, it happened well after he was hurt though.  
haralabob	721814962641854465	2016-04-17T21:37:52	Spo also took a mentally suspect player who had been kicked to the curb by more teams / leagues you could count and made him serviceable.
haralabob	721814724074086400	2016-04-17T21:36:55	Heat had one big flaw earlier in the year offensively and made a mid season change to correct it. Thats a sign of a great coach.
haralabob	721814593278844929	2016-04-17T21:36:24	He's improved every year he's been a coach. I think its not even close.  
haralabob	721814515378053120	2016-04-17T21:36:05	Kevin Love was awesome this game. Good for him having a big playoff game. Guy gets a lot of crap.
haralabob	721814068323954688	2016-04-17T21:34:19	Contrasting styles, two great coaches. Can't really ask for more in the Heat Hornets series.
haralabob	721813763104485376	2016-04-17T21:33:06	This Charlotte v Miami series should be all kinds of fun.
haralabob	721811259037851650	2016-04-17T21:23:09	Cavs have Love in at the 5, and you need offense down 5, maybe give Tolliver a try?
haralabob	721811026249797634	2016-04-17T21:22:13	Young team is coming unhinged.
haralabob	721810262714519554	2016-04-17T21:19:11	They do have Tolliver.

haralabob	721805613433364481	2016-04-17T21:00:43	Too much LeBron.
haralabob	721804964163489793	2016-04-17T20:58:08	God I love SVG.
haralabob	721804715617439744	2016-04-17T20:57:09	He'll sub Tristan with Mozgov.  
haralabob	721804549678215168	2016-04-17T20:56:29	Could have also gone with this one. 
haralabob	721804342462820352	2016-04-17T20:55:40	Lets go live to David Blatt right now. 
haralabob	721803975826145280	2016-04-17T20:54:12	If an Eastern Conference team can combine high-end talent with even a solid coach, they will just annihilate.
haralabob	721803755243474944	2016-04-17T20:53:20	Kind of wild that Lue hasn't played Frye at all. Not like having an elite 3PT shooting 5 would excel playing with LBJ or anything.
haralabob	721802397606027264	2016-04-17T20:47:56	Is he sure? Maybe they just need Gentry back.  
haralabob	721801961075380224	2016-04-17T20:46:12	Cavs coaching is a huge ? mark this playoffs.  
haralabob	721801792439209984	2016-04-17T20:45:32	Drummond is the first Pistons into the front court on every possession 2H. Hustling down to get good position in the block.
haralabob	721800533430775808	2016-04-17T20:40:32	Great few mins from Drummond here on both ends. He looks energized.
haralabob	721798576767041536	2016-04-17T20:32:45	When you have a once in a generational athlete like Anthony Davis, you want to model his game after Matt Bonner.
haralabob	721798096707948544	2016-04-17T20:30:51	Alvin Gentry's first order of business when becoming HC for Pels was trying to extend AD's range to the 3pt line. He has to be a genius
haralabob	721797274775367680	2016-04-17T20:27:35	Easy to be an offensive guru when your PGs were Nash, CP3 and Curry.  
haralabob	721796900022652928	2016-04-17T20:26:05	No. I don't.  
haralabob	721796840123858944	2016-04-17T20:25:51	Maybe look up cause and effect.  
haralabob	721796630794469376	2016-04-17T20:25:01	Morris at the 3, Tolliver at the 4. Bring Tobias off the bench.  
haralabob	721796531574022144	2016-04-17T20:24:38	Alvin Gentry's Steve Nash'less coaching record hasn't exactly been good.
haralabob	721796132368572416	2016-04-17T20:23:02	Huh? 
haralabob	721796074432638976	2016-04-17T20:22:49	mackenrivers ZachLowe_NBA All these s are defense independent. So they aren't accounting for it.
haralabob	721795058647740418	2016-04-17T20:18:46	.ZachLowe_NBA You don't think this is sustainable? 
haralabob	721793174738370560	2016-04-17T20:11:17	Doubt it.  
haralabob	721793000406274048	2016-04-17T20:10:36	This is peak SVG playoff coaching. Spacing - 16 3PA. Great 1H for the Pistons.
haralabob	721792794340163585	2016-04-17T20:09:47	That wide open KCP 3 was created bc Smith had to help on Drummonds roll, thats def one thing he brings that Baynes doesn't .
haralabob	721792498780102656	2016-04-17T20:08:36	Nothing personal, but they have a lot of similarities on the court.  
haralabob	721792211172503552	2016-04-17T20:07:28	You think magical experience will somehow make either of them able to defend the 4? 
haralabob	721791610799828992	2016-04-17T20:05:04	He has very poor court awareness.  
haralabob	721791051413848064	2016-04-17T20:02:51	Their defense took a tailspin once they went to those guys as the 3-4 combo.  
haralabob	721790916176908288	2016-04-17T20:02:19	Pistons just can't defend good enough with Morris and Harris 4 - 3 combo and this shooting isn't sustainable.
haralabob	721790246287859712	2016-04-17T19:59:39	Would love to see Morris at the 3 and Tolliver at the 4.
haralabob	721790051386982400	2016-04-17T19:58:53	I mean less of a percentage of OREBs not total - obviously good defense leads to more misses. I meant OREB%
haralabob	721789657084604416	2016-04-17T19:57:19	Surprised we haven't seen Tolliver much. I'd let him take a turn on Love.
haralabob	721789438477512704	2016-04-17T19:56:26	MikePradaSBN Tolliver can play him.
haralabob	721789359767183361	2016-04-17T19:56:08	Ya of course. He has the ability to be as good as any C in the league and then some. He's just not there.  
haralabob	721789244419678208	2016-04-17T19:55:40	Reflexively hit the mute button as fast as I could. Then realized he's only doing radio. 
haralabob	721788882493124608	2016-04-17T19:54:14	Quick which player allows less offensive rebounds when on the floor Elite Rebounder Drummond or Baynes?
haralabob	721788631791181824	2016-04-17T19:53:14	Drummond rarely anticipates where to be and is frequently late on help defense then tries to compensate by going for blocks.
haralabob	721788437045444608	2016-04-17T19:52:28	Of course Drummond has the ability to be 10x better on defense than Baynes. But Baynes is just a better tactical defensive player right now.
haralabob	721787664387563520	2016-04-17T19:49:24	Just need to keep on shooting 1.5points per attempt and they are home free.  
haralabob	721787270198480896	2016-04-17T19:47:50	A lot of it has to do with how poorly he's played defensively the 2h of the season. He's never in good position.  
haralabob	721786877729050624	2016-04-17T19:46:16	Thats my take too. He's improved a lot on both ends. Drummond is flat out a bad defensive player too.  
haralabob	721786727723995136	2016-04-17T19:45:40	Ive had a bet on every DET game down the stretch for what seems like months. I get giddy whenever Baynes comes in 
haralabob	721786619544469504	2016-04-17T19:45:14	Having him brick ft's does a pretty good job of killing the morale.  
haralabob	721786279952670720	2016-04-17T19:43:53	He wasn't nearly as good last year as he has been this year. He's improved a lot.  
haralabob	721785849810014208	2016-04-17T19:42:11	Is Baynes vs Drummond even close in terms of who is the better overall player? I'm rolling with a lot of Baynes if I'm SVG

haralabob	721784434823864320	2016-04-17T19:36:34	Not sure Detroit could have had a better 1q offensively and yet they find themselves down 2.
haralabob	721782708825825280	2016-04-17T19:29:42	alenin was referring to my own tweet.
haralabob	721782505754337280	2016-04-17T19:28:54	Not if it means more Mo Williams. Irving is fine playing when LBJ is out.  
haralabob	721782303991603200	2016-04-17T19:28:05	Lets not overreact. Took him 8 mins to make the sub. Not like he took him out after 5.  
haralabob	721781939183570948	2016-04-17T19:26:39	DET will struggle with this hard trap. They'll have to make some adjustments to handle this.  
haralabob	721781748309200896	2016-04-17T19:25:53	Like this sub by Lue getting Kyrie out and then bringing him back with the bench units.
haralabob	721780305200173056	2016-04-17T19:20:09	Agree. But what is TRoss trying to accomplish? 1. its a bad shot 2. He's not gonna impact it. 3. He leaves his man? 
haralabob	721779583410786304	2016-04-17T19:17:17	SVG back in the playoffs is a delight.

haralabob	721763888182657025	2016-04-17T18:14:55	Yes of course. If you are Miami and have the gravitas of Riley, why tank but if you have the roster PHI had? 
haralabob	721763624524468224	2016-04-17T18:13:52	bomani_jones If your owner lets you tank, and you come in with the roster situation PHI had. Tanking was the way to go. Its not close

haralabob	721518430826795008	2016-04-17T01:59:33	haralabob like a proud papa
haralabob	721518327168835586	2016-04-17T01:59:09	Reading all these anti-Jon Barry tweets is making me proud. I was on of the leaders of that moment. Nice to see others carrying the torch.
haralabob	721499432412250113	2016-04-17T00:44:04	Jon Barry wants him to stop shooting.  
haralabob	721498196942282752	2016-04-17T00:39:09	This Celts team is so tough when they are turning the opponent over.
haralabob	721497874937327616	2016-04-17T00:37:52	haralabob I love how Barry just repeats a stat and sighs  1 of 11 siiigh. Thanks for helping me learn something
haralabob	721495750052487168	2016-04-17T00:29:26	Boston’s expectation vs actual on those 16 3PA they took in the 1H? 1.02 vs .38 makeormiss
haralabob	721494279550423041	2016-04-17T00:23:35	you’ll enjoy following me more if you can detect sarcasm.  
haralabob	721492715691593729	2016-04-17T00:17:22	at some point you have to just stop shooting 3s Nate. You just have to.  
haralabob	721489898411151360	2016-04-17T00:06:11	Jon Barry on 3 point shooting is hilarious.
haralabob	721486144857214976	2016-04-16T23:51:16	I just remembered that I actually liked Jon Barry as an NBA player when he played for the Kings and now I feel sick.
haralabob	721483483974008832	2016-04-16T23:40:41	mj100mile He likes to play a lot of guys, and loves playing guys 3-4 min stints. I’m not a fan, not sure if its wrong tho.
haralabob	721483070382088192	2016-04-16T23:39:03	Ya. Looked like the 3 was forced.  
haralabob	721482265268658176	2016-04-16T23:35:51	Gotta make sure you get Tim Hardaway JR 1q mins in the playoffs.
haralabob	721480622682734592	2016-04-16T23:29:19	Normally a fan of passing up a mr 2 for a corner 3, but not if the MR 2 is in rhythm but the corner3 is forced.
haralabob	721437801670131712	2016-04-16T20:39:10	Arguing about Warriors illegal screens is like wondering why more people don’t get speeding tickets for going 65 on a 55-MPH highway
haralabob	721461065368735746	2016-04-16T22:11:36	.asoukuptx alexgaynor I thought the officiating was fine. Crawford is a good ref (when not reffing a Mavs game).
haralabob	721459391656923136	2016-04-16T22:04:57	One of the more amazing things about this game  James Harden 0 FTA.
haralabob	721458761475305476	2016-04-16T22:02:27	Kerr does this a lot. No clue.  
haralabob	721452235385753603	2016-04-16T21:36:31	Ha 
haralabob	721451954879078400	2016-04-16T21:35:24	NateDuncanNBA is gonna lose it with this GSW lineup in 3,2,1
haralabob	721451760653459456	2016-04-16T21:34:38	I have him at 23.3333 (repeating of course) wins.  
haralabob	721451032702636032	2016-04-16T21:31:44	He's really the only player that wasn't playing for GSW when MJax was the coach. If only he had Livingston... 
haralabob	721450472976949248	2016-04-16T21:29:31	I knew it was coming. I knew it. "You know how valuable Shaun Livingston is" Mark Jackson.
haralabob	721450274020167680	2016-04-16T21:28:43	Love that Brewer didn't hang his head after missing (yet another) 3. He hustled back and made a great block in transition. Great job.
haralabob	721449871408902144	2016-04-16T21:27:07	I nominate Earl Watson as my proxy. He likes to go big.  
haralabob	721449488217350144	2016-04-16T21:25:36	Sarcasm. (one of the rumored reasons they stopped playing it was bc Harden turned it over too much w/ them) 
haralabob	721448739680858112	2016-04-16T21:22:38	Did I sleep in and miss the 1159 possessions JV played today? 
haralabob	721448295432761345	2016-04-16T21:20:52	Do you have any idea how elite grabbing 41.7% of all offensive misses is? on 1159 possessions? 
haralabob	721448045112479744	2016-04-16T21:19:52	I'm really curious if either team shortens their rotation. ATL definitely should. Celts maybe not.  
haralabob	721447923523788800	2016-04-16T21:19:23	Yep.  
haralabob	721447143181946880	2016-04-16T21:16:17	People think you can't play big vs GSW bc they are too quick. Tough to be quick if you can't grab a DREB 
haralabob	721446829905170432	2016-04-16T21:15:02	Doesn't matter. This franchise is so far + away better than the rest of the league the players are almost irrelevant 
haralabob	721446493505204224	2016-04-16T21:13:42	So the Rockets are really struggling on offense, have nobody aside from Harden who can create a shot and aren't playing 2 bigs to grab OREBs
haralabob	721446210398105600	2016-04-16T21:12:35	andrewdcahoon Its not just road team. They were underdogs in all but 2 games. And the 2 games the road team was fvr odds were -2 and -1
haralabob	721445035661635586	2016-04-16T21:07:54	Steph is moving like Jarrett Jack out there now.
haralabob	721441131951620096	2016-04-16T20:52:24	Imagine how many times they'd turn it over if they played CC and DH at the same though! 
haralabob	721440915546460160	2016-04-16T20:51:32	Who knows. I honestly have no idea. It would be the dumbest way ever to fix games. Maybe loves getting booed.  
haralabob	721440087544766464	2016-04-16T20:48:15	That is amazing.  
haralabob	721438773339291648	2016-04-16T20:43:01	JB Bickerstaff refusing to give that Howard and Capela lineup any run at all. 
haralabob	721438017710215168	2016-04-16T20:40:01	I'll do that, maybe you could give me the probability of Donaghy calling Foster 143x after his bookie is innocent.  
haralabob	721437835736121344	2016-04-16T20:39:18	Teams favored by 8-11 points won 4 times in that streak. There is no proper way to do it. Its just so wild.  
haralabob	721437419585691648	2016-04-16T20:37:39	You are gonna ride this nonsensical trend without being privy to inside info?He could switch it up just as easily 
haralabob	721437198852067329	2016-04-16T20:36:46	I really don't even have an explanation for it. Does he just get off making calls for the away team? Would be a really dumb way to bet.
haralabob	721436614161870848	2016-04-16T20:34:27	Thats their trainer / therapist.  
haralabob	721436000296153088	2016-04-16T20:32:00	Quick + dirty math on this Foster Road playoff win streak (using mid market probability of each team winning based on odds) 4 million to 1
haralabob	721430998974484480	2016-04-16T20:12:08	If Kerr is going to extract every point of EV like hacking Capela to get the 2 for 1. GG League.
haralabob	721430418419884033	2016-04-16T20:09:49	Josh Smith handling the ball in the PNR. Okay.
haralabob	721425363029524482	2016-04-16T19:49:44	Its like the only thing he does well on D. Benefit of doing it is it tires him out though.  
haralabob	721424698005848064	2016-04-16T19:47:06	COJO 24 mins PatPat 28 mins  Yikes.
haralabob	721424115614126080	2016-04-16T19:44:47	Thats the x factor Corey Brewer gives you, repeated fast break (misses)
haralabob	721423127368994816	2016-04-16T19:40:51	Forcing him to guard PG was a factor too.  
haralabob	721422914625544192	2016-04-16T19:40:00	DDR guarding PG? You don't think that was a contributing factor? 
haralabob	721422735851687936	2016-04-16T19:39:18	Can go to Scola for ~6 mins.  
haralabob	721422450953625600	2016-04-16T19:38:10	KL DDR DMC (or Powell depending on DMC health) PatPat JV   Cojo Biombo either DMC or Powell. Its not rocket science. 
haralabob	721422084891541504	2016-04-16T19:36:43	Agree nothing looked egregious. 
haralabob	721421914355269632	2016-04-16T19:36:02	It wasn't just that they lost last year, it was the manner in which they lost. The lineups he played were terrible 
haralabob	721421613065842689	2016-04-16T19:34:50	kpelton was just confirming.
haralabob	721421260954009601	2016-04-16T19:33:26	kpelton Unsustainable shooting on the Pacers part?
haralabob	721419738627186688	2016-04-16T19:27:23	And he did it with a murderers row of Raptors defensive ace's guarding him. Oh wait.  
haralabob	721418147178229760	2016-04-16T19:21:04	Away team is now 13-0 in the last 13 playoff game Scott Foster has officiated. He does the little things that count (JV fouls out).
haralabob	721417913010225153	2016-04-16T19:20:08	Odds PatPat starts a game this series? Odds it'll be too late?
haralabob	721417795712319488	2016-04-16T19:19:40	So you think Casey is gonna make adjustments that he hasn't made in 3 years as a head coach?  
haralabob	721417706835062784	2016-04-16T19:19:19	Thats not on Casey. But everything else I listed is.  
haralabob	721416758154764288	2016-04-16T19:15:33	You're crazy.  
haralabob	721416692895653888	2016-04-16T19:15:17	Pacers have done a great job of fouling Toronto 50+ feet from the basket while protecting the lead and in the penalty
haralabob	721416515556212736	2016-04-16T19:14:35	Chances this gets revisited? 
haralabob	721415978400092160	2016-04-16T19:12:27	If you are expecting Lowry to be better than PG - gg.  
haralabob	721415828772491265	2016-04-16T19:11:51	Their team is plenty good enough to make it to the ECF. Plenty.  
haralabob	721415537989799936	2016-04-16T19:10:42	He just needs to slide a few seats to the right. 
haralabob	721414933729050624	2016-04-16T19:08:18	Demar has really locked him up though.  
haralabob	721414827847999488	2016-04-16T19:07:52	Thats not really that big of a deal.  
haralabob	721414408027504640	2016-04-16T19:06:12	He starts, thats the natural easy choice. But instead they went with their worst defender / offensive work horse 
haralabob	721414215047598080	2016-04-16T19:05:26	Not even Monta Ellis decision making is gonna be enough for the Raps. When does the Argos season start?
haralabob	721413676335403009	2016-04-16T19:03:18	ArmenH1 he's not healthy.
haralabob	721413303231229952	2016-04-16T19:01:49	It's Lowry/Ross/DeRozan/Patterson/JV with 4 minutes left, Pacers by 3. And no, I can't tell you why Ross is in over Carroll (or Joseph)
haralabob	721413208678879232	2016-04-16T19:01:26	Did they really gameplan DDR to guard PG for the entire game? If DMC can't go, play James over TRoss.
haralabob	721412658751090688	2016-04-16T18:59:15	Still no Jval. This is hilarious.
haralabob	721412142633582592	2016-04-16T18:57:12	LOLOLOLOLOL Oh man.  
haralabob	721412082286010368	2016-04-16T18:56:58	Also JVAL has sat too long even with 5 fouls.
haralabob	721411829298122753	2016-04-16T18:55:57	Ya leaving guys wide open from the corner for no reason is always good.  
haralabob	721411744027938817	2016-04-16T18:55:37	DDR having to guard PG has probably been as much a factor as PG guarding DDR. This can't continue.
haralabob	721411520987418624	2016-04-16T18:54:44	Cue up T Ross sleeps on his guy for another 3.
haralabob	721411419447496705	2016-04-16T18:54:20	Powell looked the best of DDR, Ross, DMC so naturally he hasn't played much 2H.
haralabob	721410564233105408	2016-04-16T18:50:56	How is this a shooting foul?
haralabob	721409857505460224	2016-04-16T18:48:07	If you are a Raps fan, there are some painfully easy adjustments they can make going forward. But then again Casey. RTZ
haralabob	721409617125748736	2016-04-16T18:47:10	Ya I agree. I don't think this is that big of an issue. Much more concerned with min allocation in general 
haralabob	721409330608615424	2016-04-16T18:46:02	Too much Lawson and PG rest combo here for INDY
haralabob	721408623050514436	2016-04-16T18:43:13	haralabob Let me place hundreds of 3 second phone calls to Tim Donaghy and find out the answer
haralabob	721408374579920896	2016-04-16T18:42:14	How many of these fouls on JVal has Foster called?
haralabob	721407347592015872	2016-04-16T18:38:09	Wow T-Ross? I give up.
haralabob	721407281212960768	2016-04-16T18:37:53	Dwane Casey is really testing Masai's statement that "He's our coach even if we lose this series"
haralabob	721407068402356224	2016-04-16T18:37:02	Don't think he's ever gonna avg &lt;40 mins in the playoffs.  
haralabob	721406893688684544	2016-04-16T18:36:21	Casey's rotations have ben bad even by Casey standards.  
haralabob	721406693540671488	2016-04-16T18:35:33	Will be interesting to see if Vogel goes with 3 mins of PG rest here or goes for the jugular.
haralabob	721406538795974656	2016-04-16T18:34:56	Thats a whole other story. I'm just talking about playing time / rotations.  
haralabob	721406031901798400	2016-04-16T18:32:55	Not starting PatPat, playing DMC first off the bench at 4 in 2h. Playing TRoss at all. A stint w/out neither Kyle or DDR. What did I miss?
haralabob	721405860333821952	2016-04-16T18:32:14	Why did he play him at all though?  
haralabob	721405226901594112	2016-04-16T18:29:43	Que? He's messed with his rotations more in this game than he has all year almost.  
haralabob	721405138548629504	2016-04-16T18:29:22	I bashed Casey all morning for his rotations last 2 playoffs. Gave him the benefit of the doubt for this year but -my confidence is wavering
haralabob	721404431745482752	2016-04-16T18:26:34	Did PatPat play too good in the 1H? Casey hasn't gone to him yet in 2h.
haralabob	721403862934892544	2016-04-16T18:24:18	CoJo needs to play more.
haralabob	721403749114097664	2016-04-16T18:23:51	NateDuncanNBA How many of those boards were on the same tip in attempts?
haralabob	721403240235999232	2016-04-16T18:21:50	Doubt PG sits &gt;3 mins the 2h anyways.  
haralabob	721403096723644418	2016-04-16T18:21:15	Raptors analytic department must not get much input on game strategies. That or they are out to lunch.  
haralabob	721402092775022592	2016-04-16T18:17:16	And here we go, the refs are starting to make themselves known for no apparent reason. Bad calls on both ends.
haralabob	721401632995483649	2016-04-16T18:15:26	Oh wow he just called a shooting foul on that Grant Hill trip? SO much for that.
haralabob	721401366464233473	2016-04-16T18:14:23	Ya I'm convinced now. I agree.  
haralabob	721400365703278592	2016-04-16T18:10:24	Tony Brothers has gone largely unnoticed. I'm impressed. Not your usual Brothers game.
haralabob	721397103918915584	2016-04-16T17:57:27	Like I said, I call.  
haralabob	721396571821072384	2016-04-16T17:55:20	His shot has looked shaky but has done everything else really well. DDR has been all around terrible though.  
haralabob	721395532598390785	2016-04-16T17:51:12	I call.  
haralabob	721394915733712896	2016-04-16T17:48:45	Just a clear spot where you want to pull it out and get a good shot with a chance at an OREB and give IND 7 secs or so for their last poss.
haralabob	721394060380901376	2016-04-16T17:45:21	The anti 2 for 1 
haralabob	721393561149673472	2016-04-16T17:43:22	Hated that possession from DDR, rushed it for no particular reason. Couldn't get 2 for 1 and had terrible floor balance.He's just not bright
haralabob	721392662427734016	2016-04-16T17:39:48	PatPat looks a bit gassed out there, I'm with NateDuncanNBA playing him for this long consecutively so you can start Luis is madness.
haralabob	721392039238049792	2016-04-16T17:37:19	And 3 fouls (one of which was absurdly bad).  
haralabob	721391964071931905	2016-04-16T17:37:01	kslay623 this one seemed lazy, he died on the pick and refused to close out.
haralabob	721391355327434752	2016-04-16T17:34:36	Real lazy possession on D from DDR lost both PG and CJ on the switch.
haralabob	721391043132792832	2016-04-16T17:33:22	And we have our first weird Foster call.
haralabob	721391004817862656	2016-04-16T17:33:13	Raps are completely owning the boards 42% OREB%
haralabob	721390321179824128	2016-04-16T17:30:30	aejonesleggo You won't see that in the 2h. Hill avg 36mpg and PG 41 mpg last playoffs for them.
haralabob	721390154665996292	2016-04-16T17:29:50	He's very likely playing all but a few mins in the 2h. Averaged 41 mins last time he was in the playoffs.

haralabob	718904458185297920	2016-04-09T20:52:34	Earl Watson would have kept his big lineup out there and just punished Pierce and Green on the O Glass (and won the game).

haralabob	718644961273491456	2016-04-09T03:41:25	They got the ball with 41 secs left, you have to work pretty hard to not get a 2 for 1 when you start the possession with 41 secs.

haralabob	718106731478290432	2016-04-07T16:02:41	I know he's referring strictly to "selection" and not the players taking them, but you have to account for contested-ness of shot too
haralabob	718106358885646337	2016-04-07T16:01:12	The only thing (or one of) that I disagreed with in the Hinkie Letter was that his team is "2nd in the league in shot selection"
haralabob	717936707912359936	2016-04-07T04:47:04	Really hope Kobe shoots better than 50% or goes on a streak of sorts his last game. Not a Kobe fan but this is ugly 
haralabob	717936223294087168	2016-04-07T04:45:08	Such a great lessons to be learned for Randle and Russell playing with Kobe down the stretch. Lesson 1 - Bad shots don't go in.
haralabob	717930397032538113	2016-04-07T04:21:59	This is true.  
haralabob	717928638943879168	2016-04-07T04:15:00	Or a cartoon on ESPN.  
haralabob	717926914988449792	2016-04-07T04:08:09	Beat me to the nittiest of picks.  
haralabob	717924592937861121	2016-04-07T03:58:56	Is the floor spread when you shoot as poorly as he does from 3? 
haralabob	717924329174884352	2016-04-07T03:57:53	Of course.  
haralabob	717923886390611969	2016-04-07T03:56:07	Corey Brewer is playing crunch time minutes because why?
haralabob	717921584162349057	2016-04-07T03:46:58	Step away from the computer, Its nap time fella.  
haralabob	717920306841563136	2016-04-07T03:41:54	You seem like you confuse easy.  
haralabob	717919542559641600	2016-04-07T03:38:51	Agree. Its filled with a bunch of interesting anecdotes.  
haralabob	717919210630873088	2016-04-07T03:37:32	.MikePradaSBN Its missing a few instances of "but I digress"
haralabob	717917958849175552	2016-04-07T03:32:34	I'll go with pacing himself.
haralabob	717907728073498628	2016-04-07T02:51:55	Could very well be pacing himself. Looked like he was slogging through mud in the 1H.  
haralabob	717903278898438144	2016-04-07T02:34:14	Harden looks dead out there.
haralabob	717898939324694529	2016-04-07T02:16:59	Alvin Gentry on Tim Frazier rolling his ankle at the end of tonight's Pelicans game: "My guess is he'll be out for the next 2 1/2 years."
haralabob	717892424811458560	2016-04-07T01:51:06	So the 10th best postup player in the league is just a hair better than the 76ers entire offense. Gotcha.  
haralabob	717892059932155905	2016-04-07T01:49:39	Wow a whole 10th in the league? Amazing. .99 ppp? Also amazing. Okay I was wrong. (someone teach Nick Math) 
haralabob	717891839852830720	2016-04-07T01:48:47	Pretty aggressive starting lineup change by the Rox paying off so far.
haralabob	717891439812673536	2016-04-07T01:47:11	citing Lee Sedol a go player is awesome.  
haralabob	717891077882032128	2016-04-07T01:45:45	If he added footnotes to a resignation letter, he lost his mind.  
haralabob	717890675375669248	2016-04-07T01:44:09	And your 31 year old star coming off of knee injury who asked to play fewer mins logged 37 mins.  
haralabob	717889998897356800	2016-04-07T01:41:28	Ya only down 7 after a perfect 9-0 run. Just need to shave another 7 points in 1.5 mins and win it in OT! 
haralabob	717888261641732096	2016-04-07T01:34:33	1. they aren't coming back. 2. Melo specifically asked to play less minutes.  3. You're muted.  
haralabob	717886528752459776	2016-04-07T01:27:40	This is getting hilarious.  
haralabob	717885779918217217	2016-04-07T01:24:42	Would have to double check but I didn't see man (any) Pistons postups on smaller guards in 2h of this one.
haralabob	717878091557654528	2016-04-07T00:54:09	Masai had to unload Rudy and Bargs and then had to listen to BC do an interview and talk about team "he built" 
haralabob	717876621760278528	2016-04-07T00:48:18	Is it too late for Colangelo to trade for Rudy Gay this season?
haralabob	717876460124385280	2016-04-07T00:47:40	A quick look at 76ers assets+ position - BC getting the job gives whole new meaning to being born on 3rd base and thinking you hit a triple.
haralabob	717876211540582400	2016-04-07T00:46:40	Can't wait for B.Colangelos daddy to give him another job and have BC try and take credit for the work of others (his life story)
haralabob	717874314888884226	2016-04-07T00:39:08	Would love to read this whole letter.  
haralabob	717872678514728961	2016-04-07T00:32:38	Marcus Morris by the way has been scoring a blistering .99 ppp on postups since getting to DET
haralabob	717871835623194624	2016-04-07T00:29:17	He didn't even get a full 3 seasons.  
haralabob	717871619247484929	2016-04-07T00:28:26	So the time he actually gets the ball and isn't denied after 6 secs you get what percentage of a shot? 
haralabob	717871055981817857	2016-04-07T00:26:11	Of course if you have Shaq... But feeding some mediocre F bc a small is switched on him? Thats not good offense.  
haralabob	717868714939383808	2016-04-07T00:16:53	One of issues with postups is it takes enter the ball into the post. You can burn 7 secs trying to get the ball in 
haralabob	717867859964112896	2016-04-07T00:13:29	Running postups for good postup players  &gt;  Running postups solely because there is a "mismatch" 
haralabob	717858074174709760	2016-04-06T23:34:36	Just need 2 of the top 5 players in the league including someone like KD who can score doing ANYTHING.  
haralabob	717857592093974528	2016-04-06T23:32:41	Stotts is like the only coach in the league who realizes just how inefficient running a postup is.
haralabob	717856858283778048	2016-04-06T23:29:46	SVG who is a genius seems utterly fascinated with running Tobias and Morris slow developing postups.
haralabob	717855898849267712	2016-04-06T23:25:58	Pistons playing super *tight* passing up open 3s and getting worse and worse looks as the clock runs down.
haralabob	717841813214613504	2016-04-06T22:29:59	That DEN lineup is 10pts per 100 possessions better than the Pels 5. Its not close.  
haralabob	717841361970401282	2016-04-06T22:28:12	Douglas, Ennis, Cunningham, Ajinca and Asik? 
haralabob	717840832741552129	2016-04-06T22:26:06	Is this the worst starting lineup any team has fielded this year? 
haralabob	717836721442803712	2016-04-06T22:09:45	You can love AD and love KAT more.  
haralabob	717835092857454592	2016-04-06T22:03:17	StPaulHawk I used flyhlitchi I don't think it returned to home when it lost signal but i also got paranoid and tried following it.
haralabob	717834923717971968	2016-04-06T22:02:37	jmbryan03 i have a construction project that i am interested in keeping tabs on. Much easier to send the drone out to take vid.
haralabob	717833243857276928	2016-04-06T21:55:56	Few different bounces of the ball here and there and Rambis could easily be a .300 coach.
haralabob	717833143625973760	2016-04-06T21:55:32	His 64-161 coaching record is misleading. Sure he's only winning 28% of his games but a few games didn't go his way. 
haralabob	717831492412399616	2016-04-06T21:48:59	w/ his track record and how he's handled things since becoming interim (afflalo and lopez min issues) he's earned it 
haralabob	717828932423131136	2016-04-06T21:38:48	DJI Phantom 3 Pro 
haralabob	717824942738243586	2016-04-06T21:22:57	Pretty freaking amazing if you ask me.
haralabob	717824906973458432	2016-04-06T21:22:49	Answered my own question, can send the drone out on a 3800m roundtrip "mission" and have it come back when its done despite losing signal.
haralabob	717760635988082688	2016-04-06T17:07:25	Go back and look at the minutes KAT played early in the season and compare that to Porzingis. Mitchell has handled his minutes deftly.
haralabob	717759693096034304	2016-04-06T17:03:40	For as much hate as Mitchell gets (from me) he's done a pretty good job managing KAT this year. Didn't burn him out early.
haralabob	717758926280740864	2016-04-06T17:00:37	KAT. Having a C much more valuable than a PF and I don't think AD can play C with his frame 
haralabob	717758708164329472	2016-04-06T16:59:45	The most important thing a GM does is hire a coach. He's gonna be 0-2. What has he done that makes you think he CAN? 
haralabob	717757252212379649	2016-04-06T16:53:58	Man the career KAT is gonna have if he stays healthy. I haven't seen a rookie PF/C play like this since Duncan.
haralabob	717754115426627586	2016-04-06T16:41:31	He desperately wanted Greg Monroe.  
haralabob	717753797854892032	2016-04-06T16:40:15	Like hiring a GM who wants to run an antiquated system and make Rambis his head coach to run said system? 
haralabob	717753318487896064	2016-04-06T16:38:20	God forbid he loses Phil, aside from drafting Porzingis what exactly has Pjax done to make you think he can GM? 
haralabob	717565328587251712	2016-04-06T04:11:20	haralabob just got a notification about Knicks strongly considering  Rambis for HC. Immediately thought of you
haralabob	717565295246839808	2016-04-06T04:11:12	All I could think about was haralabob shaking his head in disbelief 
haralabob	717563940385849345	2016-04-06T04:05:49	He desperately needs therapy really fantastic talent but a complete headcase.  
haralabob	717562036087971840	2016-04-06T03:58:15	Rondo was disappointed bc he sunk off him and gave him the open look so he could collect the rebound.  
haralabob	717560681902399490	2016-04-06T03:52:52	Rondo has had a disgusting defensive game even by his standards.
haralabob	717551833120542722	2016-04-06T03:17:43	OJ calls you to party after he got acquitted. You going?
haralabob	717542230647386117	2016-04-06T02:39:33	Que? 
haralabob	717540058513821696	2016-04-06T02:30:55	Wasn't referring to that call.  
haralabob	717539985046446081	2016-04-06T02:30:38	They play again tomorrow.  
haralabob	717539563388796929	2016-04-06T02:28:57	Scott Foster is putting on a masterclass right now on how to cash a ticket in the sneakiest possible way.
haralabob	717534730447499264	2016-04-06T02:09:45	Thats pretty far down the list of things Fred needs to work on in the summer but hey.  
haralabob	717534001720729600	2016-04-06T02:06:51	Tony Allen wants no part of the free throw line right now, if Hoiberg was any kind of coach he'd hack him. Worst case they take him out.
haralabob	717532635581427712	2016-04-06T02:01:26	Of course not but the goal is to get the best shot each time down, he wasn't doing that he was going for assists.  
haralabob	717532330013790210	2016-04-06T02:00:13	Street Walking.  
haralabob	717531784645226501	2016-04-06T01:58:03	Not sure it matters not like they care if they've cared about winning since the all star break  
haralabob	717530649507172353	2016-04-06T01:53:32	Giannis has been full out assist whoring for the entire 4q trying to get 2 more for the triple double.
haralabob	717524114181722112	2016-04-06T01:27:34	Giannis plays in real life exactly the way you'd play if you were playing an NBA2K game for your life with LeBron on your team. DRIVE
haralabob	717521245126852608	2016-04-06T01:16:10	Great coaching moment for Brett Brown - how to use 23 secs on every possession down the stretch when winning. Should payoff.
haralabob	717501252595089408	2016-04-05T23:56:43	Birdman again.  
haralabob	717490790839115777	2016-04-05T23:15:09	Why is Brett Brown allergic to running a simple high screen?
haralabob	717464306892218368	2016-04-05T21:29:55	Franchise0501  has the best stats and also a JSON to grab info.
haralabob	717419813677568000	2016-04-05T18:33:07	Since the All-Star break, the Cavaliers have outscored opponents by 14.5 points per 100 possessions with Kyrie Irving on the bench.
haralabob	717400446822785027	2016-04-05T17:16:09	This is awesome - would be more amazing if Pop was lying when he said he never watches film of his opponents.  
haralabob	717380566065217536	2016-04-05T15:57:09	RE Panama Papers, I thought that Larry Summers told us that $100 and €500 bills were what criminals used to hide their ill gotten gains.
haralabob	716808615462617088	2016-04-04T02:04:26	Knicks now 1-8 under Rambis in games separated by 5 pts or less during final 5 mins of play. Team was 12-16 in such situations under Fish.
haralabob	716797411021066240	2016-04-04T01:19:54	Its Twitter people would rather correct someone than actually be right.  
haralabob	716797068031864832	2016-04-04T01:18:33	Almost all his points came with him as the primary ball handler driving.  
haralabob	716796573288497153	2016-04-04T01:16:35	Giannis scored 34 points as a PG with this shot chart surrounded by ZERO outside shooting. Pretty Impressive. 
haralabob	716777125366267904	2016-04-03T23:59:18	He can play. Underrated player for sure.  
haralabob	716776346907594756	2016-04-03T23:56:12	A -25 in 16 mins.  
haralabob	716770851547262976	2016-04-03T23:34:22	Bird watch, they've scored 8 points in 6 mins with him in again to start the 3q. Someone page johnhollinger
haralabob	716769215026319360	2016-04-03T23:27:52	That was my hot take theory after 1 week of watching him.  
haralabob	716769134701187073	2016-04-03T23:27:33	Lifeshtock I think until he learns to move the ball ya.
haralabob	716768957806432256	2016-04-03T23:26:51	Bucks have zero shooting, why doesn't Hoi run a double at Giannis vs having Justin Holiday and Dunleavy get crushed?
haralabob	716768412714737664	2016-04-03T23:24:41	Only chance Niko has is to get up on him and hope the stench of his beard gives Giannis issues.  
haralabob	716766487621439488	2016-04-03T23:17:02	Dunleavy has no chance guarding Giannis. OXI
haralabob	716759465630916608	2016-04-03T22:49:08	They've scored .63 with him in and 1.58 with him out today so far, the quality of the looks with him in are terrible 
haralabob	716758979502682112	2016-04-03T22:47:12	Birdman never sets a decent screen, holds the ball too long on O and is a step slow on D. Kills them.  
haralabob	716758319398957057	2016-04-03T22:44:34	
haralabob	716758237161205762	2016-04-03T22:44:15	ZBO, JM Green, J Martin, and then some stretches with Barnes or lance at the 4. Don't need to play him.  
haralabob	716756976605093889	2016-04-03T22:39:14	Bird comes back in and Vuc scores 6 straight points, decent shot defense a zero on denying the ball tho.
haralabob	716756778973671426	2016-04-03T22:38:27	Yep. My bad.  
haralabob	716756345626558466	2016-04-03T22:36:44	I want a CP3, Melo, LBJ NBA team just for the chapeau comedy.  
haralabob	716754595905536000	2016-04-03T22:29:46	I just became a MJax fan, thats some great comedy there.  
haralabob	716752524267511808	2016-04-03T22:21:33	Love CDJ but if he plays Birdman any more minutes in this game he's lost his mind.
haralabob	716748969016045568	2016-04-03T22:07:25	They changed that rule guys.
haralabob	716747243638755328	2016-04-03T22:00:34	Someone break it down for JVG and Breen. Its definitely not inexplicable.
haralabob	716746026032312320	2016-04-03T21:55:43	Also I called this rest thing a few weeks ago when I said Rambis was gonna put Porzingis, Lopez, Melo in a hospital. 
haralabob	716745779449315328	2016-04-03T21:54:44	I love how the Knicks players need to ask if they can rest or be subjected to 43 mins of playing time from Rambis.  
haralabob	716744712527286273	2016-04-03T21:50:30	I was not privy to this new information. Thanks.  
haralabob	716743975432888321	2016-04-03T21:47:34	How bad has Kanter been today? OKC gave up 1.39 points per when he was in .88 when he was out. Thats remarkable.
haralabob	716741699024781313	2016-04-03T21:38:32	Dallas was defending superbly and then David Lee checked in.
haralabob	716737881465720833	2016-04-03T21:23:21	I wonder if Kanter has any idea who terrible he is at D or if he's oblivious to it.
haralabob	716730483145465856	2016-04-03T20:53:58	He's like the younger point guard version of Rudy Gay.  
haralabob	716721878405001216	2016-04-03T20:19:46	This guy coaches an NBA team and wanted control over personnel. (Karl wowed by Jeff Green) 
haralabob	716704808904687616	2016-04-03T19:11:56	Not good enough to start over Tony Douglas in Gentry's world tho.
haralabob	716704622618882048	2016-04-03T19:11:12	Tim Frazier can play.

haralabob	715368399958728704	2016-03-31T02:41:32	Placing such a huge emphasis on getting 73+ and playing Varajao this much is comical.
haralabob	715367244226670592	2016-03-31T02:36:56	They've shot 2 free throws buddy 
haralabob	715365766506254336	2016-03-31T02:31:04	UTA isn't guarding GSW's C, so solution is apparently to put in Varejao. It'd really be a shame to see coaches throw away 73 w/ AV fetish

haralabob	715333530218156032	2016-03-31T00:22:58	I actually love watching the team and Curry is my favorite player to watch. How do I have any venom towards them?

haralabob	715331844380561412	2016-03-31T00:16:16	Sure, the on court product and how well they are performing is largely based on lucking into Curry and his contract. 
haralabob	715331528943767553	2016-03-31T00:15:01	Lightyears ahead of the league meanwhile you have your Starters in up 16 with 2 mins left and never rest them. I'm sure Pop is laughing.
haralabob	715331212034768896	2016-03-31T00:13:45	GSW is so far ahead of the rest of the league that they couldn't beat the team they are playing tonight in a 7g series w/out Curry
haralabob	715331010594885634	2016-03-31T00:12:57	Curry's value to GSW is so insane, everything from the space he forces the D to play at to the shots he makes.
haralabob	715330346309459969	2016-03-31T00:10:19	How do they operate differently? They have the best player in the league w/ the best contract in the league.  
haralabob	715330176821829633	2016-03-31T00:09:39	Or Lee getting hurt which forced them to play Draymond. Utterly lacking in hubris (which coming from me is rich).   
haralabob	715329857224245249	2016-03-31T00:08:22	How are they lightyears ahead of the rest of the league? How are they at all ahead of the league aside from Curry?
