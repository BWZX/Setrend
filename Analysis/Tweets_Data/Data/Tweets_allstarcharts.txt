allstarcharts	690339687181848576	2016-01-22T01:06:21	@HonestAbeTrader why would you look at a 15 year chart with 200% price moves any other way?
allstarcharts	690337473709244417	2016-01-22T00:57:34	went outside with my laptop, opened it up &amp; this was 1st thing I saw. What does this chart tell u? Are u buying it? 
allstarcharts	690336362503909376	2016-01-22T00:53:09	JBoorman ColeProducer and then incorporate that into your decision making to pick high flyers to short or press bad ones, etc
allstarcharts	690336085948301313	2016-01-22T00:52:03	JBoorman ColeProducer in other words if more stocks going down lets short stocks rather than if more stocks going down lets still buy some
allstarcharts	690335758599589888	2016-01-22T00:50:45	JBoorman ColeProducer agree price is only thing that pays. My point is factoring in sum of parts conclusion to decide direction of trend

allstarcharts	690311144116871168	2016-01-21T23:12:56	JBoorman yup that's fine. You're a trend follower. That's your job. I'm a weight-of-the-evidence guy and look more globally. All good
allstarcharts	690309895485194241	2016-01-21T23:07:59	but below all of that overhead supply that was former support from march to august 
allstarcharts	690308739933450241	2016-01-21T23:03:23	JBoorman it's a "market of stocks" is it not?
allstarcharts	690307827529691136	2016-01-21T22:59:46	my data suggests otherwise 
allstarcharts	690307659413598208	2016-01-21T22:59:05	JBoorman Jon the S&amp;P500 is not an accurate representation of the US Stock Market, yet alone global. It's a cap weighted index of 500 names
allstarcharts	690305505009381380	2016-01-21T22:50:32	remember that nonsense about T.I.N.A.? what was that all about? lol
