summer_said	686675917377114112	2016-01-11T22:27:51	essamz I guess they mean they manage them
summer_said	686675530314153984	2016-01-11T22:26:18	essamz so was wondering why they don't say the same with reserves in their annual reports
summer_said	686675338848514048	2016-01-11T22:25:33	essamz the reason I'm asking is that Aramco always makes the distinction between them and Saudi Arabia as awhole
summer_said	686675014503034880	2016-01-11T22:24:15	essamz why does Aramco always say "we have reserves of" xyZ if they don't own them.
