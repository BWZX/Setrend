davepell	704119938315759616	2016-02-29T01:44:09	Chris Rock. Best comedian of our era at the top of his game. They should end the show right now.
davepell	704118942441148418	2016-02-29T01:40:12	People who tuned in expecting to see Billy Crystal sing a song were in for a surprise.

davepell	703774273320538113	2016-02-28T02:50:36	Trump has made history in one way. He is the first candidate ever to gain weight on the campaign trail.  He’s also the first to turn orange.
