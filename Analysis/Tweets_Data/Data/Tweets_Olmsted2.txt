Olmsted2	682213867649380352	2015-12-30T14:57:15	Olmsted2 But for the $10M outlay plus $10M collateral, hey get back $4m as a g-fee, then about $4.5m annually from managing.  WAL ~ 8yrs
Olmsted2	682213654847164416	2015-12-30T14:56:24	Olmsted2 but one would think in this case MMAC could just step in with financing. Or work something out with the fund GP if in fund
