AoDespair	723690298258288641	2016-04-23T01:49:47	CarlBrandt77 BKtheElder Why not call them prison camps.  That's accurate.  Or internment camps.  Which is precise.
AoDespair	723690151629582337	2016-04-23T01:49:12	CarlBrandt77 BKtheElder No torture. No forced labor.  No malnutrition.  No death rates exceeding those of normative population.
AoDespair	723689937426591744	2016-04-23T01:48:21	CarlBrandt77 BKtheElder It was racist. It was an outrage.  But those camps were not concentration camps as we all know the term.
AoDespair	723689748791975936	2016-04-23T01:47:36	CarlBrandt77 BKtheElder Yes. Again, Lincoln locked up whole state legislatures without charge and indefinitely. He's overall great, too.
AoDespair	723689543317241857	2016-04-23T01:46:47	CarlBrandt77 BKtheElder Internment camp, sure.  Or call them prisons.  But concentration camps speak to something much, much darker.

AoDespair	714654121358397441	2016-03-29T03:23:14	csoghoian That's a big "or" for many in your audience. Indeed, the omission induces many to conclude the latter.

AoDespair	714652030711762945	2016-03-29T03:14:56	csoghoian I've worked w/the ACLU before; used them as a resource before. Never knew 'em to stack deck so much as to omit basic LE intent.

AoDespair	714651141976489984	2016-03-29T03:11:24	csoghoian That doesn't absolve anyone who is honestly brokering facts in argument from giving even the basic context. After all....
AoDespair	714650729298788357	2016-03-29T03:09:46	csoghoian As someone who is trying to listen to all sides and balance, I don't trust any advocate that omits the societal goal at stake.
AoDespair	714650421717913601	2016-03-29T03:08:32	csoghoian Agreed, of course.  But you could make all of those arguments and STILL inform readers as to FBI purpose. Don't stack the deck.

AoDespair	714648849630040064	2016-03-29T03:02:17	csoghoian I know the goal of interposing between pedophiles and children doesn't matter to you as much as privacy issues. But is that...

AoDespair	714648319855820801	2016-03-29T03:00:11	csoghoian You're veering off the fundamental here. You can handily critique all that you find wrong with the case, no problem.  But why...
AoDespair	714648028746031105	2016-03-29T02:59:02	csoghoian Certainly, the goal of investigative pedophiles didn't actually merit even a mention in your original missive until I asked.
AoDespair	714647469003550720	2016-03-29T02:56:48	csoghoian And in such statements, I conclude that your POV is such that no societal goal is of sufficient worth if it compromises privacy.
AoDespair	714646845876789248	2016-03-29T02:54:20	csoghoian Frankly, given the omission of the FBI's basic purpose here, I'm not inclined to selectively review your materials.
AoDespair	714646584567459840	2016-03-29T02:53:17	csoghoian In such omissions, I see that those who speak to privacy or security alone, without addressing other, are just stacking the deck.
AoDespair	714645932441210881	2016-03-29T02:50:42	csoghoian That our legit desire for privacy sometimes is in direct conflict with the needs of society to protect those vulnerable.
AoDespair	714645699502153728	2016-03-29T02:49:46	csoghoian In a single tweet -- and its notable omission -- you've avoided acknowledging that governance is hard and complicated.
AoDespair	714645131626942464	2016-03-29T02:47:31	csoghoian Because what I am questioning is the incomplete depiction of the inherent and relevant conflict between two real values.
AoDespair	714644900004962305	2016-03-29T02:46:36	csoghoian No one is questioning your standing. And it's clear what matters more to you.  But are there societal goals others might value?

AoDespair	713827062998388736	2016-03-26T20:36:48	JulianHoeber Context, intent and the variables that such things require turns Yale's six-page memo to pure, unadulterated shit.

AoDespair	713826453599576064	2016-03-26T20:34:23	JulianHoeber You will be hard pressed to explain to me how someone wearing a costume inhibits 1) other costumes 2) critique of costume.
AoDespair	713826242756083712	2016-03-26T20:33:33	JulianHoeber Then address those mores independent of trying to utilize prior restraint against the speech/assembly of others.
AoDespair	713825953286201344	2016-03-26T20:32:24	JulianHoeber It is when it is then used as justification for 1A being accessible only for more powerless.  That's a tragic crutch.
AoDespair	713825666421010432	2016-03-26T20:31:15	JulianHoeber You're backsliding into a pile of strawmen. The right to speech/assembly has equal weight for all. Content? Never.

AoDespair	713820014529253376	2016-03-26T20:08:48	JulianHoeber I emerge extremely dubious about the intellectual heft or utility of handicapping the 1A by dint of power dynamic.
AoDespair	713819672571809793	2016-03-26T20:07:26	JulianHoeber Seeing how quickly cited the weaker political/social status of those using force to intimidate reporters/photogs at Mizzou....
AoDespair	713819302009286656	2016-03-26T20:05:58	JulianHoeber "Can I get some muscle here?" and a beer-hall putsch are calling to the same brutish logic. Ends aside, the means are awful.

AoDespair	713818363101732865	2016-03-26T20:02:14	JulianHoeber No doubt being a political minority at the time &amp; out of power, their claim of unique speech needs/rights mirrors others now.
AoDespair	713817938646556672	2016-03-26T20:00:33	JulianHoeber Remember, the first thing that Nazism did in the streets of Munich in the '20s was beat on critics/reporters who countered 'em
AoDespair	713817603391664128	2016-03-26T19:59:13	JulianHoeber more and more fascistic in their demand for public discourse independent of counter or critique.
AoDespair	713817433752997888	2016-03-26T19:58:32	JulianHoeber History shows that today's minority that is allowed to validate even small monopolies on speech can become, over time,
AoDespair	713817134254587904	2016-03-26T19:57:21	JulianHoeber So practically, asserting for any mitigation in 1A absolutism risks devaluing a currency that real activism requirees.  Worse:

AoDespair	713816460854886401	2016-03-26T19:54:40	JulianHoeber Problem of utilizing public space for assembly and then attempting to bar others from the space was mitigated...
AoDespair	713816213734854656	2016-03-26T19:53:42	JulianHoeber except on their own terms was abjectly hypocritical. They fell back on a defense vis a vis power dynamic as you offered.

AoDespair	713815815473106944	2016-03-26T19:52:07	JulianHoeber Violates everything empirical in any construct of logic or rhetoric.  And in the real world, I'll use example to make clear:

AoDespair	713786871629778944	2016-03-26T17:57:06	JulianHoeber No, I speak of the purpose of a university, which must actually be as/more rigorous in protecting speech than greater culture.

AoDespair	713784996989784064	2016-03-26T17:49:39	JulianHoeber Hyperbole now embarrassing. If you compare content/tone Christakis email and find Protocols, you are beyond all reasoning.
AoDespair	713784621494743040	2016-03-26T17:48:09	JulianHoeber I read it. It asked, openly, if there shouldn't be more discussion. If too much to be endured by college students, well, shit.
AoDespair	713781944782204928	2016-03-26T17:37:31	JulianHoeber So was the reply that merely asked if such hyperbolic guardrails were the way to proceed and for more discussion.

AoDespair	711671079056621568	2016-03-20T21:49:42	csoghoian Are you saying the Nextel precedent inverted that? Or raised the bar for custodial maintenance of even call  data?
AoDespair	711670745663979522	2016-03-20T21:48:22	csoghoian I'm surprised because by title 3 a subpeona gets you call data from any other carrier; DNR needs affidavit and cause.
AoDespair	711669861156560896	2016-03-20T21:44:51	csoghoian If they brought Nextel to heel why not Apple, at least on the phone data.
AoDespair	711669661398532097	2016-03-20T21:44:04	csoghoian And that unique among carriers they dont need be the custodian of call records?  Even if suit prevails I see Congress jumping in.
AoDespair	711669047574831105	2016-03-20T21:41:37	csoghoian Are you saying Apple doesn't have to help real time surveillance like a DNR or digital equivalent?
AoDespair	711668808830812160	2016-03-20T21:40:40	csoghoian Ability to run a DNR is metadata only that has real time application.

AoDespair	711667039501479936	2016-03-20T21:33:39	csoghoian Snowden See my previous tweets. There is precedent in compelling all com carriers to maintain call data, tap ports. I.e. Nextel
AoDespair	711666512487124992	2016-03-20T21:31:33	csoghoian If Apple successful here it would be an astonishing precedent as per FCC and legal standard.
AoDespair	711666234488713216	2016-03-20T21:30:27	csoghoian big fight years ago when Nextel tried to claim their tech. precluded such. US would not allow Nextel coms to fall into black hole
AoDespair	711665880057380865	2016-03-20T21:29:02	csoghoian Based on commerce laws FCC regs require all comm carriers operating in US to maintain call records/provide entry ports for taps.
AoDespair	711665035043610624	2016-03-20T21:25:41	csoghoian Snowden And that if it isn't in gov possession, it at least be maintained as investigative tool.  Shelf-life of burners, et al
AoDespair	711664554598666240	2016-03-20T21:23:46	csoghoian Snowden But I also see the US desire to access metadata w/order, and to have ready access to haystack to chase metadata needle.
AoDespair	711664034639122432	2016-03-20T21:21:42	csoghoian Snowden Perhaps that is the wedge. Cant say I disagree.
AoDespair	711663498300882944	2016-03-20T21:19:34	csoghoian Snowden If SC or Congress says so, then it's so. If not, Apple is pissing up its own leg for appearance sake, seems to me.
AoDespair	711663013301002240	2016-03-20T21:17:39	csoghoian Snowden Big question is should Smith v Md. Stand with regard to smart phone data.  Or is it too broad because of the vast yield.
AoDespair	711662600770166785	2016-03-20T21:16:00	csoghoian Snowden Just so. Will go to Congress or USSC or both. But no 4A guard on metadata yet of either kind where it matters.
AoDespair	711661869761753088	2016-03-20T21:13:06	csoghoian Snowden Yes just so. Of course all of this NSA data pile stuff is by US code so in terms of the antiterror stuff, moot.
AoDespair	711661207581753344	2016-03-20T21:10:28	csoghoian Snowden I know the issue is in appeals courts and perhaps a duality between phone data and the rest should be legislated.
AoDespair	711660887988412416	2016-03-20T21:09:12	csoghoian Snowden I don't think this is correct. A fed investigation goes by US code to fed court, no?

AoDespair	711659318869925893	2016-03-20T21:02:58	csoghoian Snowden Gotcha. But can I assume all US metadata acquisition still operating under Smith v Md.?

AoDespair	710832499493085184	2016-03-18T14:17:29	judsonlester I would simply take the Nov.-Jan. shopping window away from GOP, which they are already floating for hearings.
AoDespair	710832086563823616	2016-03-18T14:15:50	judsonlester For me, the 5th vote on the SC trumps a single election cycle, particularly when the House can't be turned.
AoDespair	710831970033410048	2016-03-18T14:15:22	judsonlester And under no circumstances are Dems. going to win back the House this time.  Redistricting saw to it.

AoDespair	710830802775314432	2016-03-18T14:10:44	magicChopstick Maybe that's it.  But the risk management here is an inverse ratio. It's high-low poker, I guess. BO going for whole pot?
AoDespair	710830491004309505	2016-03-18T14:09:30	elldcbc sepinwall Okay, but again, what I'm trying to take off the table is the free window of Nov.-Jan. tween election and inauguration.
