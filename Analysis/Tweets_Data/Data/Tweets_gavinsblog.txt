gavinsblog	718922070361534469	2016-04-09T22:02:33	But not just there. I know many humble and amazing journalists who day in and day out do the work, with no recognition. This must change.
gavinsblog	718921685446049793	2016-04-09T22:01:01	And in companies like storyful as marklittlenews knows, few people know the extraordinary work journalists there do.
gavinsblog	718921310068453378	2016-04-09T21:59:31	It is frustrating to the extreme that the best journalists I know have never received an award from peers. Ever. We all fight same battle.

gavinsblog	718920630675107840	2016-04-09T21:56:49	Tupp_Ed yea that depends on the hack. And circumstance. And other variables.
gavinsblog	718919742392778752	2016-04-09T21:53:18	And older journalists need to feel they're not obsolete. We fail miserably at recognising the amazing work of Irish hacks.
gavinsblog	718919436602839040	2016-04-09T21:52:05	And new journalists need to feel that their work is appreciated and valid. It's not egos, just that you're on the right track.
gavinsblog	718919159120326661	2016-04-09T21:50:59	And conor_w_ryan would laugh at the idea of an award from peers. But this needs to change because good journalism should be encouraged

gavinsblog	718918325045182468	2016-04-09T21:47:40	There's a problem when Irish journalism doesn't be recognise skill or achievement. Industry awards don't count. Peer awards do.

gavinsblog	697598958135193600	2016-02-11T01:52:07	ronanburtenshaw for me 1) Many countries/people wanted to join 2) There were rational reasons to join 3) Open door policy was NATO's call
gavinsblog	697596953891368960	2016-02-11T01:44:09	ronanburtenshaw though increased unemployment always leads to greater mortality rates I'm guessing.
gavinsblog	697596029710028800	2016-02-11T01:40:28	ronanburtenshaw interesting read. 
gavinsblog	697595258041982976	2016-02-11T01:37:24	ronanburtenshaw agreed on this, but I'm guessing intertwined issues for newly independent states beside EU/NATO members.
gavinsblog	697594997256941568	2016-02-11T01:36:22	ronanburtenshaw this looks like a good read on the pros/cons 
gavinsblog	697594785348087808	2016-02-11T01:35:32	ronanburtenshaw q might also be, was NATO right to seek expansion, or countries right/wrong to apparently want it?
gavinsblog	697594615734648835	2016-02-11T01:34:51	ronanburtenshaw I guess this is what I have some difficulty with, pre-determined vs just stuff that happened. I'm applying Hanlon's Razor.
gavinsblog	697593800651358210	2016-02-11T01:31:37	ronanburtenshaw I forgot that Hungary had a referendum on the issue, too.
gavinsblog	697593296974118912	2016-02-11T01:29:37	ronanburtenshaw I guess a related question is; if there was popular support, then was it logical for Poland to pursue that objective?
gavinsblog	697592259441782784	2016-02-11T01:25:29	ronanburtenshaw is this passage accurate? 
gavinsblog	697589955531563008	2016-02-11T01:16:20	ronanburtenshaw was there popular support for NATO/EU membership from the 1990s onwards?
gavinsblog	697589829559836672	2016-02-11T01:15:50	ronanburtenshaw if I was in Poland in the mid 1990s, I'd be looking at Russian activity in Chechnya and I'd be worried.
gavinsblog	697589560176463873	2016-02-11T01:14:46	ronanburtenshaw I thought Walesa was supportive of NATO membership. Asked recently about Ukraine. Interesting. 
gavinsblog	697588085341753346	2016-02-11T01:08:54	ronanburtenshaw what were Polish interests though? Would it not be logical for them to push for NATO and EU membership?
gavinsblog	697586484422057984	2016-02-11T01:02:33	ronanburtenshaw why did Poland push for NATO membership etc from 1991 onwards though?
gavinsblog	697585517442023425	2016-02-11T00:58:42	ronanburtenshaw is this Law and Justice?
gavinsblog	697585092722561024	2016-02-11T00:57:01	ronanburtenshaw so Polish people voted for certain parties in the 90s and changed in the 2000s?
gavinsblog	697584568417783808	2016-02-11T00:54:56	ronanburtenshaw so who orchestrated it? Or was it orchestrated?
gavinsblog	697583837719719937	2016-02-11T00:52:02	ronanburtenshaw and this was orchestrated, by NATO?
gavinsblog	697583306880188417	2016-02-11T00:49:55	ronanburtenshaw but in general populations willingly joined European Union.. and in combination sometimes, NATO?
gavinsblog	697581926496993280	2016-02-11T00:44:26	ronanburtenshaw so elections were free and fair post 1990, but populations were manipulated?
gavinsblog	697580950025334785	2016-02-11T00:40:33	ronanburtenshaw or might be a reaction of countries previously under Russian influence seeking to defend from happening again?
gavinsblog	697580118601043968	2016-02-11T00:37:15	ronanburtenshaw not a fan of Putin or NATO tbh. Expansion of alliance was desired by countries formerly in Eastern Block though?
gavinsblog	697579048969617409	2016-02-11T00:33:00	ronanburtenshaw a natural reaction to increased Russian activity, as is the re-opening of closed ASW facilities in Iceland, I guess.
