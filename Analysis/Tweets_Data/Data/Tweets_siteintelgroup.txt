siteintelgroup	708011615443144704	2016-03-10T19:28:17	8) Of note is that documents pertain to time before ISIS changed name from ISIS/ISIL to IS in June 2014.
siteintelgroup	708011478922731522	2016-03-10T19:27:45	7) See ISIS publications Dabiq and Naba referring to “Jihadi John” and other fighters as being “killed” 
siteintelgroup	708011048394219520	2016-03-10T19:26:02	6) Skeptics also mention use of “killed” vs. “martyred.” ISIS often uses “killed” (examples following graphic) in Arabic &amp; Eng
siteintelgroup	708010311077511168	2016-03-10T19:23:07	5) Skeptics noting inconsistent spellings (Dawla Islam vs al-Dawla al-Islamiya). Not much of a red flag; seen both 
siteintelgroup	708008601110056960	2016-03-10T19:16:19	4) Several names mentioned as recruits’ references make sense, such as known ISIS smuggler “Tariq al-Jabra’a” (aka “Abu Mohammed alShami”)
siteintelgroup	708008448907210752	2016-03-10T19:15:43	3) For example, AQ recruits had to sign forms w/similar criteria before joining group   
siteintelgroup	708007566312411136	2016-03-10T19:12:12	2) It is reasonable to expect that ISIS would have new recruits file forms and questions. Also, similar docs have been seen before.
siteintelgroup	708007273549975552	2016-03-10T19:11:02	1) Contrary to current skepticism, alleged ISIS docs obtained by Germany gov, which list foreign recruits, don’t seem far-fetched
