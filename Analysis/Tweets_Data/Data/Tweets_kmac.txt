kmac	685692265042284544	2016-01-09T05:19:10	prchovanec it teaches them how the person with the most physical power gets to inflict upon the smaller and weaker. Great lesson!
kmac	685692098536804353	2016-01-09T05:18:30	prchovanec if it's "about theatrics" (which is a nonsense - it's about power) why not just be real with your kids?
