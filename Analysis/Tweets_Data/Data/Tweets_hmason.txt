hmason	725382330530041856	2016-04-27T17:53:19	groby I actually just tried and that option doesn't appear for me. Perhaps it's my version of OS X.
hmason	725380244249690114	2016-04-27T17:45:01	glen_george Rochelle I just tried this and that option is not there for me.
hmason	725169518390157314	2016-04-27T03:47:40	groby wait, really? I totally missed that.
hmason	725166392836804608	2016-04-27T03:35:15	Rochelle It's in /Users/[username]/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary . I won't share the horrific find command I used to get there. :)
hmason	725165677854752768	2016-04-27T03:32:25	Accidentally added a typo to the Mac dictionary, had to edit a hidden config file to remove it. How do non-tech people even use computers?
hmason	725068953383362560	2016-04-26T21:08:04	Finally got this running: snappy in-editor "autocomplete" powered by a neural net trained on old sci-fi stories. 
hmason	725066329020092416	2016-04-26T20:57:38	nerdworldorder Definitely. The challenge is the difference in complexity between solving for n=1 (just me) vs solving for large n (anyone).
hmason	725064376173092866	2016-04-26T20:49:52	nerdworldorder :-) we've come a long way since 2009!

hmason	725007589038280704	2016-04-26T17:04:13	There are a few tickets left for the FastForwardLabs Data Leadership conference on Thursday afternoon! 
hmason	724707891198996481	2016-04-25T21:13:20	mrogati pbrane I have used a slide very close to that before, but it's pretty straightforward stuff.
hmason	724688922136174594	2016-04-25T19:57:57	Automated text summarization is interesting, useful, and underhyped. Why we chose it for a FastForwardLabs report: 
hmason	724666191701225474	2016-04-25T18:27:38	antimytheme zeigenvector thebinarium I don't know what level they are looking for, but TanookiLabs is good people and they are hiring
hmason	724627262612619264	2016-04-25T15:52:56	sh1mmer I think studies show people like recommendations more with a reason, and Google Play's interpretation is bullshit.
hmason	724623550380924928	2016-04-25T15:38:11	sh1mmer Does that make sense to you? I would think Uber is used by people who are not more likely than average to use AWS.
hmason	724604427680755713	2016-04-25T14:22:12	One of these games is not like the others. 
hmason	724246104200630272	2016-04-24T14:38:21	kissane Ordered. Thanks for the recommendation. :)

hmason	722476690186833925	2016-04-19T17:27:20	jtleek dgmacarthur Agreed, but I'm also concerned about the issues that come up when a system is marketed as automated when it isn't.
hmason	722465204588699648	2016-04-19T16:41:42	John4man Some things aren't so easy to make. Lots of confirmation bias in building businesses that way. :)
hmason	722426952137719808	2016-04-19T14:09:42	danofer What these companies are doing is not human-in-the-loop ML (which is very powerful).
hmason	722260140032946176	2016-04-19T03:06:50	When a new startup announces an implausible "AI", always look at their jobs page to see how many low wage "trainers" they are hiring.
hmason	722259777611505664	2016-04-19T03:05:24	So many "AI" products are just humans behind the scenes + dramatic tech marketing. 
hmason	722188702617718784	2016-04-18T22:22:58	There are Google reviews of prisons.

hmason	717188891040681984	2016-04-05T03:15:31	peteskomoroch Yes, they render it as a card. I assume the API has the full URL.
hmason	717187695689265153	2016-04-05T03:10:46	yash_j1 Many. For example:  The URL has been moved to a card.
