WillHassellws	682775978167242752	2016-01-01T04:10:53	DavidSchawel at least give MSU credit for finishing in the final four in both Football and Basket ball
WillHassellws	682775067143483393	2016-01-01T04:07:16	Like MSU, I'm done for 2015
WillHassellws	682772376686170112	2016-01-01T03:56:34	I will retweet that  
WillHassellws	682772316124614656	2016-01-01T03:56:20	Well Clemson its up to you to make sure Sabin doesnt win a national championship
WillHassellws	682771916482940928	2016-01-01T03:54:44	DavidSchawel Bama was my worse case scenario  for MSU, they could have had a better chance with OU or Clemson
WillHassellws	682771718285336576	2016-01-01T03:53:57	DavidSchawel MSU is playing like an embarrassment to everything they have done this season
WillHassellws	682770978686935040	2016-01-01T03:51:01	DavidSchawel I will say they have stopped Henry pretty well
WillHassellws	682770842002931714	2016-01-01T03:50:28	DavidSchawel they defiantly arent playing like they did against OSU, Sabin has bad effect on them
WillHassellws	682770217844396032	2016-01-01T03:47:59	DavidSchawel refs only called grounding on MSU, looks like they want bama to win
WillHassellws	682767686695129088	2016-01-01T03:37:56	CramersShirt question, was that grounding or no?
WillHassellws	682765211661537281	2016-01-01T03:28:06	Why havent they just given the championship to bama and just save us the misery
