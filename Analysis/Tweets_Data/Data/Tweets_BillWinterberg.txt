BillWinterberg	707942220150808576	2016-03-10T14:52:32	alexbenke DocuSign Absolutely agree. But where I balk is calculating value solely based on the size of the deal. It's just software.
BillWinterberg	707938254557999104	2016-03-10T14:36:47	.billwinterberg right.  I think we're on the same page.  Billing based on effort/complexity is sensible.  Billing based on AUM isn't.
BillWinterberg	707937907680677888	2016-03-10T14:35:24	ariadneadvisors Cop out is to make a blanket fee of % of AUM and call it good. It's easy. Clients "get it." If it ain't broke... ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
BillWinterberg	707937686976405504	2016-03-10T14:34:32	ariadneadvisors Size only, no. But how &amp; where that portfolio is allocated, yes. Tax deferred, private equity, stock options, etc. count.
BillWinterberg	707937409233788929	2016-03-10T14:33:25	ariadneadvisors But most expensive TurboTax is a flat fee. It never changes for a $100k or a $1M AGI return. Because it's software.
BillWinterberg	707937096061870081	2016-03-10T14:32:11	ariadneadvisors Pretty close. I definitely pay higher fees based on my return's complexity. SCorp x2, Schedule A, B, C, D, K-1 all adds up.

BillWinterberg	707931264301535233	2016-03-10T14:09:00	ariadneadvisors AUM-fees is the legacy way to 1) estimate client complexity and 2) estimate the value of advice. The model is threatened.

BillWinterberg	691649526361407489	2016-01-25T15:51:11	CindiHill Short answer is yes. A policy should be in place governing how data (client phone numbers) is managed by advisers in vehicles.
