BillSimmons	726240683489513472	2016-04-30T02:44:06	My bad - Wade is the 4th best 2-guard ever. MJ, Kobe, West, then Wade, then Sam Jones.
BillSimmons	726239786885767168	2016-04-30T02:40:32	Dwyane Wade - one of the greats. Probably the 5th best 2-guard ever.
BillSimmons	726238767896350720	2016-04-30T02:36:29	Faulk is the best 
BillSimmons	726235352726294528	2016-04-30T02:22:55	I hate the Lakers and just can't find it in me to hate on the Luke Walton hiring. It's the first smart Lakers move in like 4 years.
BillSimmons	726175074059833344	2016-04-29T22:23:23	On 1st ep of ringer's new NBA Show - me + howardbeck did a Knicks/Nets/Clips deep dive. What's the plan for all 3?

BillSimmons	726056867558879232	2016-04-29T14:33:41	Money ain't got no owners, only spenders. 
BillSimmons	726049725837758465	2016-04-29T14:05:18	A very good deadline column. 
BillSimmons	726046686930296833	2016-04-29T13:53:14	The best is when Goodell keeps bragging about the integrity of the game... Less than 24 hours after a gas mask/bong scandal.
BillSimmons	726044719348781056	2016-04-29T13:45:25	McCann thinks Brady has a defamation shot. I think we're at that point. 
BillSimmons	726042329052643328	2016-04-29T13:35:55	If Brady didn't do anything, then he should sue the NFL for defamation because Goodell is now making it seem like he blatantly cheated.
BillSimmons	725876004086898691	2016-04-29T02:35:00	Thanks to the 2015-16 Celtics for an entertainingly lovable season. Now let's win the lottery and sign a superstar.
BillSimmons	725870600862855168	2016-04-29T02:13:31	Celts were up 29-19 in Game 5... and then the Hawks went on a 180-115 run. Not a misprint.
BillSimmons	725863357744447488	2016-04-29T01:44:45	Had a video had surfaced of Tunsil soaking in a tub of HGH and Vicodin, he would have been taken 8 picks ago.
BillSimmons	725862316789526529	2016-04-29T01:40:36	I'm sending the bat signal out for Marcus Smart. 
BillSimmons	725852362099683329	2016-04-29T01:01:03	Why does iPhone spell-check keep changing "bong pipe" to "bong pope?" Come on Apple get your shit together.
BillSimmons	725852023216730116	2016-04-29T00:59:42	Wait I'm missing a gas mask/bong pope NFL Draft scandal? Come on halftime!
BillSimmons	725842192099610624	2016-04-29T00:20:38	Side note?! Unbelievable atmosphere in Boston. Can't hear myself think, much less speak.  ATLvsBOS Game6
BillSimmons	725838530459504640	2016-04-29T00:06:05	Key guy for the Celts tonight: Evan Turner. They can't win unless he's at least in the 25-5-5 range. Hawks will trap the hell out of Isaiah.
BillSimmons	725837477873750016	2016-04-29T00:01:54	Hi friends! My name is robertmays, and I'm a writer at The Ringer. I'm also the guy tweeting NFL Draft thoughts and bad jokes here tonight.
BillSimmons	725837828475637761	2016-04-29T00:03:18	Let's go Celtics fans in the new Garden tonight... we need your A-plus-plus-plus game.
BillSimmons	725828848823078912	2016-04-28T23:27:37	"Roger, I know St. Louis lost its football team and Oakland and San Diego are next... but wher do you think the Pro Bowl ends up?"
BillSimmons	725828148290408448	2016-04-28T23:24:50	"Roger - you spent 20 million to legally prove that you could make any decision you want, no matter how dumb it is. This has to feel good."
BillSimmons	725827523372683264	2016-04-28T23:22:21	I was really hoping Berman would ask Goodell about the future locations of the Pro Bowl and the Draft, I was on the edge of my seat.
BillSimmons	725827053484830720	2016-04-28T23:20:29	Another grueling interview on ESPN for Goodell.
BillSimmons	725813137782374400	2016-04-28T22:25:11	My mom really liked my new BS Pod with sacca so that counts for something. Here's the iTunes link. 
BillSimmons	725762320891158528	2016-04-28T19:03:15	For android users, here's the Google Play link for my BS Pod w/ sacca ... Welcome aboard Google Play Music!

BillSimmons	725710935545905152	2016-04-28T15:39:04	Losing Cowherd badly hurt ESPN Radio and the numbers don't lie. Losing Skip will badly hurt ESPN2 and the numbers won't lie.
BillSimmons	725709851720982529	2016-04-28T15:34:46	No matter what critics thought, First Take was successful - it's the only ESPN2 show that ever routinely beat ESPN shows at same time.
BillSimmons	725708836082847744	2016-04-28T15:30:44	I didn't enjoy First Take but Skip and SAS had real chemistry and I don't think you can just throw someone else in there. Won't be the same.
BillSimmons	725708422268620802	2016-04-28T15:29:05	Fascinating that ESPN lowballed the Big Ten's rights, lost Tirico and lost Skip in same week. ?
BillSimmons	725705592677892096	2016-04-28T15:17:50	Very pleased that the 99th Channel33 episode was this dynamite Jam Session cc: akdobbins. Kelly Ripa on the lam! 
BillSimmons	725702830409961473	2016-04-28T15:06:52	My dream for tonight's Draft: Belichick rushes the podium after pick 31 and picks "Fuck You Goodell, quarterback, Fuck Off University."
BillSimmons	725702177616891906	2016-04-28T15:04:16	We'll have some announcements about the ringer 's podcast network tomorrow... We are up to stuff. For now:

BillSimmons	725552996025700352	2016-04-28T05:11:29	JB Bickerstaff is like a young Kurt Rambis.
BillSimmons	725552698292998144	2016-04-28T05:10:18	"All right James, keep in touch."  "You too Dwight."
BillSimmons	725552157273923588	2016-04-28T05:08:09	Unless Dwight wanted to stay in to avoid sitting next to Harden on the bench...
BillSimmons	725551703114670080	2016-04-28T05:06:20	Bickerstaff keeping Dwight out there down 30 with 2 mins left is such a hilarious FU.
BillSimmons	725401037444538368	2016-04-27T19:07:39	I couldn't resist doing a Director's Commentary for Sacramento's latest inspirational Kings video. 
BillSimmons	725377452264943617	2016-04-27T17:33:56	You do NOT count out Austin Rivers like this.
BillSimmons	725377176502030337	2016-04-27T17:32:50	So thecousinsal says Portland is -280 to advance even w/ 5 + 7 on the road. I'm activating the "Nobody Believes In Us!" button for LAC.

BillSimmons	725153427278290945	2016-04-27T02:43:44	Biggest quarter of the season for the Maine Red Claws right now.
BillSimmons	725152051978620928	2016-04-27T02:38:16	Don't turn the channel - JR Giddens and JaJuan Johnson are coming in soon.
BillSimmons	725148743809425408	2016-04-27T02:25:07	Tough to beat a team as good as Atlanta 3 straight times with a 6-man team. I'll be back with more excuses later.
BillSimmons	725147640506114048	2016-04-27T02:20:44	Boston hasn't been this bad defensively in a while. Open guys everywhere. They look worn out. It's almost time for Fab Melo to come in.
BillSimmons	725138142345318400	2016-04-27T01:43:00	Boston was up 29-19 with 6 mins left and then brendanzig called me about a work thing so this is all his fault.
BillSimmons	725135356387942401	2016-04-27T01:31:55	Celts blew a mammoth chance in this first half - Atlanta was execrable for a solid quarter and a half and somehow it's tied.
BillSimmons	725130195556929536	2016-04-27T01:11:25	Wow they finally called Al Horford for a moving pick! I thought he had a special ID clearance card that allowed him to do them.
BillSimmons	725126256824479744	2016-04-27T00:55:46	Just a heroic performance by Drake.
BillSimmons	725100192408592384	2016-04-26T23:12:12	Skip knows that Horowitz is a fantastic teammate (unless you're playing pickup basketball with him). 
BillSimmons	725082782569889792	2016-04-26T22:03:01	New BS Pod - iTunes link for me and keyandpeele - "Keanu" comes out on Friday!

BillSimmons	725077760092344322	2016-04-26T21:43:03	Didn't think megschuster would so easily surpass robertmays as the most gung-ho Mizzou grad in my life. 
BillSimmons	725067856409284608	2016-04-26T21:03:42	Clairvoyant Bill thinks Blake has played his last Clippers game.

BillSimmons	724839713857802241	2016-04-26T05:57:09	I'm starting to think the Celtics can win the title. We only need like 5 more superstars to go down.

BillSimmons	724619356953440256	2016-04-25T15:21:32	Hey cklosterman ... have you changed your mind yet?  
BillSimmons	724611015929798656	2016-04-25T14:48:23	I picked Columbus as my preseason sleeper and I picked a Kings-Panthers FInals 2 weeks ago. I'm going to stick to basketball.
BillSimmons	724604523528990721	2016-04-25T14:22:35	The NBA playoffs are starting to heat up, and JonathanTjarks  has got five takeaways from this weekend's games 
BillSimmons	724598933733826560	2016-04-25T14:00:22	Went to this - the opening with "Hank" and "Beverly" was absolutely incredible. What a special night. 
BillSimmons	724595789155041280	2016-04-25T13:47:53	Streaming on HBO Go and HBO Now: episode one of "After the Thrones" - the ultimate TV deep dive on GoT! 
BillSimmons	724400213981450240	2016-04-25T00:50:44	Best of 3. I want to send Marcus Smart money.
BillSimmons	724397582001139716	2016-04-25T00:40:16	Millsap has scored one hoop since Smart starting guarding him. He's playing the 4 defensively and point on other end. Mini-Draymond!
BillSimmons	724396699536347136	2016-04-25T00:36:46	Thanks to Coach Bud for that last play. Overtime! FYI - Millsap is 19 for 29 and rest of Hawks are 17 for 60.
BillSimmons	724395479866331137	2016-04-25T00:31:55	Stay classy Al Horford 
BillSimmons	724392278601535489	2016-04-25T00:19:12	I'm glad America is witnessing the ultimate Marcus Smart game. I love this guy. He's one of a kind and he gives a shit.
BillSimmons	724390556135104512	2016-04-25T00:12:21	The Prez put Smart on Millsap... I love it
BillSimmons	724389654481362947	2016-04-25T00:08:46	Marcus with the horrendous post-up turnover, then the dumb offensive foul, then the careening and-one layup... He's going to kill my dad...
BillSimmons	724388635756240896	2016-04-25T00:04:43	Swedish Larry Joe Bird!
BillSimmons	724388016173645824	2016-04-25T00:02:16	Crowd is aliiiiiiiiiiiiiive. Some of those Isaiah shots were incredible. He's 5-foot-8!
BillSimmons	724386286874685441	2016-04-24T23:55:23	Gronk has a better chance of defending Millsap than Sully. Just put a jersey on Gronk.
BillSimmons	724385004881498112	2016-04-24T23:50:18	Smart's energy and fearlessness is X-Factor for rest of this game (for better and worse). Celts need him to flick the balls-out switch.
BillSimmons	724381905022406657	2016-04-24T23:37:59	Millsap murdered the crowd. This is so impressive.
BillSimmons	724377177630724096	2016-04-24T23:19:12	Shoutout to rembert for Millsap's 26 in one half and for getting up before 9am on a Sunday. 
BillSimmons	724371896356114432	2016-04-24T22:58:12	If the Hawks play LeBron in the playoffs the series is going to be sponsored by Orbitz.
BillSimmons	724370601972920320	2016-04-24T22:53:04	I still think Boston can win this series even though every Hawk is allowed to travel.
BillSimmons	724365697006993408	2016-04-24T22:33:34	This is not the series for Jared Sullinger.
BillSimmons	724335246859083777	2016-04-24T20:32:35	Don't have the energy for a "Wait a second... my gawd that's Dwight Howard's music!" tweet but here's his music.  
BillSimmons	724321331773198336	2016-04-24T19:37:17	Don't forget - HBO Now, tonight, in the wee hours after the conclusion of GOT's West Coast airing (1am et range) 
BillSimmons	724268300721508352	2016-04-24T16:06:33	Best 2013 NBA Draft picks were 15-10-27-17. And 1 is out of NBA. That draft is turning into a WTF documentary. 
BillSimmons	724263142188941314	2016-04-24T15:46:03	Clips about to blow Game 3 on NBA Tv right now...
BillSimmons	724261797146972160	2016-04-24T15:40:43	PS -- 
BillSimmons	724261576883105793	2016-04-24T15:39:50	There's a long legacy of great Celtics crowds - hopefully we'll have another one today. Here is the ceiling...  
BillSimmons	724104674995888128	2016-04-24T05:16:22	Blake was the best player in Round 1 twelve months ago. It feels like 12 years ago.
BillSimmons	724104037260390400	2016-04-24T05:13:50	Blake's 3 up one with 3 mins left was the worst shot of Round 1 so far.
BillSimmons	724078488441905152	2016-04-24T03:32:19	GGG in person wow wow wow wow wow wow
BillSimmons	723908049295941633	2016-04-23T16:15:03	FYI  RT SiliconHBO: it'd be a mistake to miss out on the SiliconValleyHBO marathon that starts now on HBO 2. 
BillSimmons	723906488947847168	2016-04-23T16:08:51	MarkHarrisNYC Same - I think it's because morning TV is so pleasant and happy and safe and fake so when there's discord it's jarring.
BillSimmons	723887352431570944	2016-04-23T14:52:48	BS Pod: talking Prince w/ CKlosterman + Wesley_Morris and a little NBA w/ housefromdc  
BillSimmons	723741616196853760	2016-04-23T05:13:42	Sharks scored 5 goals without scoring on a penalty shot and a 5 on 3. What an abomination of a performance by LA's D. Stunningly bad.
BillSimmons	723727003988291584	2016-04-23T04:15:38	Sharks fans have to be thinking about that penalty shot up 3-0...
BillSimmons	723704604853071873	2016-04-23T02:46:38	Thanks again Phoenix!!
BillSimmons	723700152288993281	2016-04-23T02:28:56	Marcus with the incredibly bad 3 immediately followed by the incredible chase block was the Marcus Experience personified.
BillSimmons	723695328554156033	2016-04-23T02:09:46	Bazemore and Thabo are taking Turner out of this series... Celts need (gulp) Smart to create some offense. Can't bring IT back too soon.
BillSimmons	723692870327144449	2016-04-23T02:00:00	Celts desperately need Turner to carry them for next 5 mins offensively or the sweep is coming...
BillSimmons	723692595465969664	2016-04-23T01:58:54	Not the series for Sullinger.
BillSimmons	723689997304369152	2016-04-23T01:48:35	Isaiah vs. Schroeder is my new favorite NBA feud.
BillSimmons	723619480404779008	2016-04-22T21:08:22	PS: I have no idea how PEDs entered my body before today's especially lively BS Podcast - I would never intentionally take PEDs.

BillSimmons	723618270671081473	2016-04-22T21:03:34	These PEDs can be so sneaky with the way they invade unsuspecting bodies. 
BillSimmons	723590788551049216	2016-04-22T19:14:22	New BS Pod: Remembering Prince w/ CKlosterman + Wesley_Morris then NBA w/ HousefromDC  
BillSimmons	723590045140062209	2016-04-22T19:11:25	Also - President Stevens needs to win an f'n playoff game. He's going to be a tough sell in November's election with an 0-8 playoff record.
BillSimmons	723589495958835200	2016-04-22T19:09:14	And the Celts can't do the "start out flat, miss a bunch of shots and fall behind by 15" routine again. Hawks are too good and too balanced.
BillSimmons	723588902498398209	2016-04-22T19:06:52	Need the Celtics fans to bring it tonight - no Bradley, no Father Kelly, Crowder at half-speed. Crowd needs to bring its old-school A-game.
BillSimmons	723588371633692672	2016-04-22T19:04:46	We did an all-Prince ringer newsletter today - subscribe at . I have a Prince pod coming shortly.
BillSimmons	723536421072441344	2016-04-22T15:38:20	The Sharks have what it takes to win the Cup - two A-List stars, a rejuvenated star, a hot goalie + depth. I don't see anyone stopping them.
BillSimmons	723535062696783872	2016-04-22T15:32:56	Can't believe I am going to my last LA Kings playoff game tonight. The Sharks are just too good - no way they blow this.
BillSimmons	723524251072925696	2016-04-22T14:49:58	I feel good about my pick... 
BillSimmons	723521925058727937	2016-04-22T14:40:43	Welcome to the Ringer - alyssabereznak harvilla claire_mcnear mattborcas and MJ_Baumann ... we are starting to look like a website!
BillSimmons	723403782042718209	2016-04-22T06:51:16	On previous tweet - you can almost see Dwight trying to figure out if he can move his post-sweep Turks &amp; Caicos flight by 2 days.
BillSimmons	723402852769484800	2016-04-22T06:47:34	This slayed me. All-time great. RT SeanFarnham: Check out the excitement from the guys on the Rockets bench...

BillSimmons	722995890672148480	2016-04-21T03:50:27	From pure blink test - Blake looks banged up to me but seems like he is fighting through it and figuring out little spurts of impact.
BillSimmons	722995174205345792	2016-04-21T03:47:36	I'm at the Clips game. Can someone please take away Chris Kaman's sunscreen?
BillSimmons	722913922471190530	2016-04-20T22:24:44	Conspiracy Bill is concerned that Minnesota will win the lottery to drive up the sale price of the T-Wolves even more.
BillSimmons	722913398178975746	2016-04-20T22:22:39	In fact, I'd like to buy the Timberwolves John Spano-style. Here's my offer, Glen Taylor: 800 million. Will wire you the money later.
BillSimmons	722912687936503808	2016-04-20T22:19:50	I'm so happy for Thibs + Towns + the long-suffering 'Sota fans. What a perfect match of coach and talent. Wish I could buy T-Wolves stock.

BillSimmons	722832219115421697	2016-04-20T17:00:05	Travon welcome back to the extended Los Angeles area!!!!
BillSimmons	722830841387220993	2016-04-20T16:54:36	Kelly Ripa needs to take over LeBron's account and start subtweeting Strahan.
BillSimmons	722802763659223041	2016-04-20T15:03:02	(Unless Minnesota thinks they can get Dave Joerger and are just playing possum right now... He's good too... I'd still vote for Thibs.)
BillSimmons	722802406795321345	2016-04-20T15:01:37	Minnesota better hire Thibs. How is this even an internal debate? He's a top-5 coach and they have the NBA's most talented young team.
BillSimmons	722798982380949504	2016-04-20T14:48:01	If they did a play-in tournament for 8-seeds they could make up the Round 1 money... And we could have, say, Minnesota in Round 1 right now.
BillSimmons	722798597759041537	2016-04-20T14:46:29	Also: think how much fun OKC-Dallas would be if Dallas could close out the series at home. That's real pressure on OKC. Right now - none.
BillSimmons	722798344876109825	2016-04-20T14:45:29	2015 Round One - the 8 losing teams won 9 games total. And they might win less than that in 2016. Speed this shit up.
BillSimmons	722797386699902978	2016-04-20T14:41:40	I'd do Best of 5 Round One and I'd only guarantee 7 seeds in each conference... Single elim. tournament w/ other 16 teams for last 2 seeds.
BillSimmons	722796902819831811	2016-04-20T14:39:45	If Round 1 went back to Best of 5, they could start the reg. season 2nd week of November which they should do anyway.
BillSimmons	722796608178376706	2016-04-20T14:38:34	I love basketball. It's my favorite sport. But Round 1 needs to go back to "Best of 5." Make it so all top-2 seeds have 4 of 5 home games.
BillSimmons	722795929997221890	2016-04-20T14:35:53	It's been a weird spring with Round One of the NBA Playoffs having tragically passed away, but it's made me love playoff hockey even more.
BillSimmons	722791748292911107	2016-04-20T14:19:16	
BillSimmons	722546471728340992	2016-04-19T22:04:37	It's true - I'm co-hosting Mike Francesa's show with him for an entire day next month. 5 hours of yuuuge yuuuuge entertainment.
BillSimmons	722465868609822720	2016-04-19T16:44:20	Waiters should eat a snack with Serge Ibaka who is also doing nothing. They could share hummus and celery. 
BillSimmons	722440654853242880	2016-04-19T15:04:09	The Browns are actively shopping the second pick - what could go wrong?
BillSimmons	722439313988845568	2016-04-19T14:58:49	ZachLowe_NBA I was just GUESSING what it would be like. How have we not done a pod in a year? That hurts almost as much as Foster/Brothers.
BillSimmons	722438371725828096	2016-04-19T14:55:04	I don't know if Foster + Brothers will be bad for Boston or Atlanta, just that it will be bad and it will make my insides hurt.
BillSimmons	722437747093340160	2016-04-19T14:52:35	When your team is in a playoff game with Scott Foster AND Tony Brothers it's like watching your baby get dangled out of a window.
BillSimmons	722437484173393920	2016-04-19T14:51:33	I'm not tweeting during tonight's Celts-Hawks game b/c Scott Foster AND Tony Brothers are reffing and I don't want you to think I'm insane.
BillSimmons	722435163863404544	2016-04-19T14:42:19	It's thewatchpod! Previewing THRONES w/ChrisRyan77 netw3rk &amp; MalloryRubin! Plus: Interview w/ Richard Linklater! 
BillSimmons	722297603254128640	2016-04-19T05:35:42	Wow - Dustin Brown threw his body around like a maniac 3rd period and OT and it finally paid off with a goal. This is a GREAT series.
BillSimmons	722287579580616704	2016-04-19T04:55:53	Great sports toggling right now. Sharks-Kings is round one playoff hockey at its absolute best... could see either team winning the Cup.
BillSimmons	722283467354943489	2016-04-19T04:39:32	Congrats to emilynussbaum on her much-deserved Pulitzer for criticism - as they say in card collecting she is a 1 of 1. I love reading her.
BillSimmons	722275237123862528	2016-04-19T04:06:50	bristei It's not venting. You are well-respected and so is Variety. That short piece did not reflect the quality of either of you.
BillSimmons	722272609845444608	2016-04-19T03:56:24	bristei Not to mention the other inaccuracy (about why I don't work there anymore) which was also embarrassing. Next time, email me.
BillSimmons	722271490314383360	2016-04-19T03:51:57	bristei I know you were carrying ESPN's water in that piece but it was embarrassing. ringer has 21 former Grantlanders (plus me)
BillSimmons	722268375439646721	2016-04-19T03:39:34	Text from a buddy: "Kobe has to feel threatened that someone else missed 26 shots in a playoff game."  (Fine I texted that to myself)
BillSimmons	722251192877723648	2016-04-19T02:31:17	Westbrook is the 4th worst 3 point shooter EVER of anyone who's taken more than 1500 threes. Someone tell Billy Donovan.
BillSimmons	722243399118487554	2016-04-19T02:00:19	This is starting to feel like the "Rick Carlisle pulls down Billy Donovan's pants and avoids the sweep" game.
BillSimmons	722095103829868545	2016-04-18T16:11:03	Nice to see lindsayzoladz make her ringer debut in our newsletter today w/ a smart piece - go to  to subscribe.
BillSimmons	721927485307228160	2016-04-18T05:04:59	
BillSimmons	721923466174148608	2016-04-18T04:49:01	20 years ago, McHale could have become the NBA's Madden at NBC with Marv - instead he became Sota's GM. Fun to hear them belatedly.
BillSimmons	721857881901891584	2016-04-18T00:28:25	Memphis should let Vince Carter shoot 50 times and see if the refs will let them do moving screens.
BillSimmons	721856599103381504	2016-04-18T00:23:19	TNT should have buried this Spurs-Grizzlies series on TruTV and re-ran classic 73-win Warriors games.
BillSimmons	721813524834463744	2016-04-17T21:32:09	Torn on Baynes over Drummond late. I know the basketball reasons make sense but don't they want Drummond getting crunch-time playoff reps?
BillSimmons	721810448618684417	2016-04-17T21:19:56	I love when LeBron complains about foul calls. This season he finished 18th in minutes and 145th in personal fouls.
BillSimmons	721794090245828608	2016-04-17T20:14:56	These days you can make max money without giving max effort on the defensive end.   lebronsubtweets
BillSimmons	721763689024454661	2016-04-17T18:14:07	Rough news about Avery Bradley. Celts need Rozier for 20-25 MPG and he was way too tentative offensively this year. Never ever attacked.
BillSimmons	721756022843383810	2016-04-17T17:43:40	I loved playing with Ray Allen because he put the time in. He didn't just show up and think his talent could carry him, you know?
BillSimmons	721754598222921728	2016-04-17T17:38:00	Good luck to DWade in round one - the best teammate I ever had.
BillSimmons	721753867478630400	2016-04-17T17:35:06	Pau Gasol is a great example of an All-Star power forward who switched teams and figured out how to sacrifice as a complementary star.
BillSimmons	721753499789164544	2016-04-17T17:33:38	Really respect how Popovich coaches the Spurs - he solicits constant input from his best players which is what all coaches should do.
BillSimmons	721752985001308160	2016-04-17T17:31:35	Chris Paul is such a great point guard because he actually tries to get his teammates involved before he worries about his own offense.
BillSimmons	721752597451771905	2016-04-17T17:30:03	FYI: since LeBron is going dark on social media during the playoffs, I'm going to be subtweeting his teammates for him.
BillSimmons	721578552743702528	2016-04-17T05:58:27	Hey Kings fans - it's a long series and Joe Thornton is on the other team.
BillSimmons	721516067638542337	2016-04-17T01:50:10	Korver/Thabo/Schroeder/Hardaway went 1 for 21 and the Hawks still won. Congrats to Hawks majority owner rembert.
BillSimmons	721514066993225728	2016-04-17T01:42:13	Two brainfarts on same play - Thomas swinging to Turner then Smart fouling after the miss. Dammit!!!!! This was winnable!
BillSimmons	721513327709425665	2016-04-17T01:39:17	Really hope the Prez has Smart guarding Teague for this final minute.
BillSimmons	721508405555298304	2016-04-17T01:19:43	Marcus can hold the fort. Bazemore is the key Hawk offensively if Celts are trying to hide Thomas on him...
BillSimmons	721507819686473728	2016-04-17T01:17:23	Looked like a pulled hammy for Bradley. Celts have had great injury luck this season... Until right now...
BillSimmons	721507007086272512	2016-04-17T01:14:10	MY MAN MARCUS SMART
BillSimmons	721506546157379585	2016-04-17T01:12:20	I'm guessing Stevens goes with Thomas-Bradley-Turner-Crowder-Amir in crunch time...
BillSimmons	721490033702621184	2016-04-17T00:06:43	Celts aren't shooting well but these announcers need to realize that Atlanta has a great D. You can't just say "get into the paint."
BillSimmons	721484427121942528	2016-04-16T23:44:26	It's unclear if Jon Barry has seen the Celtics play this season.
BillSimmons	721482146171322369	2016-04-16T23:35:22	I like the way Marcus is playing. That's the key Celtic in this series. Needs to do a slew of Marcus things.
BillSimmons	721481201765068800	2016-04-16T23:31:37	Not sure this is the series for Sullinger. Kinda want to see the Celts unleash a Thomas-Bradley-Smart-Turner-Crowder 5 at some point.
BillSimmons	721479449326145536	2016-04-16T23:24:39	Even Steve Ballmer wouldn't hand out neon t-shirts for a home playoff game.
BillSimmons	721474195360600065	2016-04-16T23:03:47	
BillSimmons	721467183490936832	2016-04-16T22:35:55	Big Papi is the first Boston star since Havlicek to retire too soon instead of too late. He could absolutely keep playing.
BillSimmons	721465086066360320	2016-04-16T22:27:35	I'm not doing a subtweet - O'Brien and Eck are great together. This is an excellent broadcast.
BillSimmons	721464781622743040	2016-04-16T22:26:22	If LeBron was a Sox fan he'd be subtweeting about how good the O'Brien/Eck team is - like, "Always nice to hear good baseball announcers!"

BillSimmons	721119229529817088	2016-04-15T23:33:16	Key for Boston in Round 1: Marcus Smart. Needs to make a mini-leap and I swear that it's lurking inside him... somewhere... it's in there...
BillSimmons	721118121881264128	2016-04-15T23:28:52	My prediction for Celtics-Hawks...  There's going to be a 7th game in the 404.  I have no idea who will win this game. But it WILL go 7.

BillSimmons	721077224846139392	2016-04-15T20:46:22	Of course losing 17 straight mystery NBA draft coin flips isn't as bad as having to carry Reggie Lewis's salary cap figure for 3 extra yrs.
BillSimmons	721076579430862848	2016-04-15T20:43:48	FYI: The Celts got screwed over yet again in a mystery draft tiebreaker coin flip. MY LEAST FAVORITE LEFTOVER TRADITION FROM THE STERN ERA.

BillSimmons	711556442851966976	2016-03-20T14:14:10	2. Still have Young Wilt, 2008-09 LeBron, Younger Robinson/Hakeem and Younger MJ ahead... But he's there with Young Pippen/Younger Kobe.
BillSimmons	711555518687391745	2016-03-20T14:10:30	1. Still thinking about last night's Spurs game. Sharktopus Kawhi is moving up the all-time NBA mega-athlete ladder for me.
BillSimmons	711385177864278016	2016-03-20T02:53:37	Terrific Aldridge game but I still think he regrets not teaming up with Tyson Chandler in Phoenix.
BillSimmons	711384402601713664	2016-03-20T02:50:33	(I'm trying to will it to happen...)
BillSimmons	711384288529264640	2016-03-20T02:50:05	Here comes Steph...
BillSimmons	711375360999366657	2016-03-20T02:14:37	Kawhi is in Sharktopus mode. 
BillSimmons	711374159771664384	2016-03-20T02:09:51	Steph is getting mauled in this game. The stars from the 1960's, 70's and 80's have to be so delighted. I love it too! OLD SCHOOL HOOPS!
BillSimmons	711368338950135808	2016-03-20T01:46:43	Jalen misses me so much that he's on a hunger strike.
BillSimmons	711368084875927553	2016-03-20T01:45:42	Skinny Jalen is going to leave this halftime show and go back to eating his quinoa salad with beets.
BillSimmons	711367532121198592	2016-03-20T01:43:30	Shout out to Skinny Jalen!
BillSimmons	711366773778460672	2016-03-20T01:40:30	Jefferson played more minutes than Love and Mosgov combined tonight but I'm sure Cleveland is totally happy and it doesn't mean anything.
BillSimmons	711365696656056321	2016-03-20T01:36:13	Spurs adopted CP3 approach w/ Steph tonight - went superduper handsy/MMA style on him early and often. Refs let it go - now can't go back.
BillSimmons	711364071161876480	2016-03-20T01:29:45	Rambis' 5-10 Knicks record has bumped his career winning percentage to .282. The lesson as always - don't hire Kurt Rambis.
BillSimmons	711348548650934275	2016-03-20T00:28:04	I love GSW tonight. This is a Lloyd Neal Memorial "That's why we the mf-ing champs!" Game if I've ever seen one.

BillSimmons	706297973924212736	2016-03-06T01:58:54	Scariest Cavs lineup (for me anyway) is Kyrie, Delly, Shump, LeBron and Thompson. Delly kicks it up for them, he's always up to stuff.

BillSimmons	701262236967276544	2016-02-21T04:28:40	Craziest thing about seeing GSW in person is how many threes they casually take from 27-30 feet. They might be aliens.
BillSimmons	701253136254574592	2016-02-21T03:52:30	Paul Pierce's legs are gone and it's a bummer. Needs a 3-week vacation in Germany.
BillSimmons	701247275176038400	2016-02-21T03:29:13	CP has committed 39 fouls in this game. The absolute best right now at stiff arms, shoves, clutches, bumps + nudges. In Curry's head a tad.

BillSimmons	699681004395454464	2016-02-16T19:45:25	Liked the move by Detroit to snare Tobias Harris for 2 expirings. He's a gamer. Weird move by Orlando unless a 2nd one is coming.

BillSimmons	699071656707252224	2016-02-15T03:24:05	Is 200 in play for the West or am I crazy?
BillSimmons	699069905753092096	2016-02-15T03:17:08	I don't love All-Star Games but the West talent is WAY up there. Curry + KD are all-timers and Russ is close. Not to mention the others.
BillSimmons	699063067271823360	2016-02-15T02:49:57	Sting is crushing it. I want to dole out awkward high fives to other aging white guys like we are Ryder Cup teammates.

BillSimmons	698366179484631040	2016-02-13T04:40:46	I hacked Frank Isola's account a few hours ago and made up a 3-teamer that got Kevin Love to the Celts - my bad everybody.
BillSimmons	698249168272265217	2016-02-12T20:55:49	In my NBA book - I had C-Webb 72nd and KJ 93rd. And that wasn't factoring in C-Webb's Fab Five career. KJ over C-Webb is flat-out ludicrous.
BillSimmons	698248036976189440	2016-02-12T20:51:19	So KJ is a HOF finalist but C-Webb isn't? That's incredible. This is why I wrote a whole book trying to blow up the Basketball HOF.

BillSimmons	698179963892031488	2016-02-12T16:20:49	Key deadline subplot: with Gasol gone for year and Conley headed for free agency, should Memphis deal Conley? (I think they should.)
BillSimmons	698177710489645058	2016-02-12T16:11:52	I don't want the Celts to trade for Dwight for 1 reason - it's the most fun Celtics team in 7 years, Hack-a-Dwight would ruin it. No thanks.
BillSimmons	698177257450278913	2016-02-12T16:10:04	PS: My bad, I meant Dwight for MASON Plumlee and Tim Frazier.   (I promise you - this won't be the last time I mix up the Plumlees.)
BillSimmons	698176212057722880	2016-02-12T16:05:55	Blazers = $20m under cap. Could offer Miles Plumlee/Tim Frazier for Dwight - saves Hou $20m + huge trade exception. Fun gamble for Rip City.

BillSimmons	697815373257658368	2016-02-11T16:12:04	Team that should make a move and won't... the Knicks. There's never been a better time to trade Carmelo. They will be too afraid to do it.
BillSimmons	697814940602662913	2016-02-11T16:10:21	Most likely to make a power move: Toronto, then Boston. East is wide open.  Most likely to gut their team: Phoenix, then Phoenix again.
BillSimmons	697814445796360192	2016-02-11T16:08:23	Wouldn't bet on Boogie getting traded b/c Sac is way way way screwed up internally right now. Can't agree on anything behind the scenes.

BillSimmons	697469557678612480	2016-02-10T17:17:55	If NYK deals Melo and gets Nets pick/expirings back, they could potentially get to 35m this summer - enough room for Conley/KD. Just sayin'.
BillSimmons	697467869534167040	2016-02-10T17:11:13	Most fun NBA fake trade possible: Knicks also get 2016 Brooklyn pick, Clips also get 2016 picks from Boston/Dallas.

BillSimmons	695627306040098816	2016-02-05T15:17:28	My advice: Nets should buy out Joe Johnson, trade Thad Young for a 1st rounder and sit Brook Lopez to save his body for next season.

BillSimmons	695453941522235392	2016-02-05T03:48:35	1st time seeing Anaheim this year. Kudos to the Ducks for assembling their most unlikable team ever. Bieksa = the cherry on the dick sundae.

BillSimmons	694912701890318337	2016-02-03T15:57:53	Brooklyn might play its way out of the top-3 if they get 82 games out of Brook Lopez - which would be greatest achievement of 21st century.
BillSimmons	694912070446219265	2016-02-03T15:55:23	LA is headed for the 3-spot b/c it's Byron Scott's destiny to threaten their protected pick while simultaneously ruining D'Angelo Russell.
BillSimmons	694911575782608896	2016-02-03T15:53:25	Phoenix did the best impersonation of a tanking franchise while actually trying to be good (and just being completely incompetent).

BillSimmons	694566342972743680	2016-02-02T17:01:35	Did we ever figure out how Nikola Jokic fell to 41 in a 2014 Draft in which so many non-lottery teams wanted to stash prospects overseas?
BillSimmons	694402116232699906	2016-02-02T06:09:00	At 2:47 mark of today's BS Pod w/ Thibs, I opened a Kevita drink that sprayed all over me for 10 solid secs.

BillSimmons	693954795204259840	2016-02-01T00:31:30	So happy President Stevens finally embraced a 9-man rotation. You can't win consistently in the NBA until you settle on your 9 (10 max).

BillSimmons	693584690440081408	2016-01-31T00:00:51	LSU's coach just made Lon Krueger look like Red Auerbach.
BillSimmons	693580932784066561	2016-01-30T23:45:55	My biggest BS nitpick (and he's young + this is fixable) is that he picks his spots too much. Sometimes you just have to grab the wheel.
BillSimmons	693580249838125056	2016-01-30T23:43:12	Buddy Hield is a killer. I know he's 22 already but he has to be a late-lottery pick.
BillSimmons	693575413738516480	2016-01-30T23:23:59	Hopefully Johnnie Jones is saving the "repeatedly iso BS on the left side so he can go 1-on-1 or draw a double" play for SEC Tourney.
BillSimmons	693573708129013760	2016-01-30T23:17:12	I just wish college basketball had more commercials.

BillSimmons	692959663151775744	2016-01-29T06:37:12	Let's see if the Utah fans approve this one - Hayward to Minnesota for Towns, Wiggins and two first round picks.
BillSimmons	692958817731088384	2016-01-29T06:33:51	Hayward to Atl, Teague to Utah, Korver to Cle (trade exception). Utah would cut 7.5m and be 15 mill under cap for a 2nd move. I like it!
BillSimmons	692942072869974017	2016-01-29T05:27:19	I can't wait to talk on tomorrow's podcast about Utah fans and their predictably irrational love for Gordon Hayward. Get ready HousefromDC
BillSimmons	692925099113082880	2016-01-29T04:19:52	CNN is rocking a 9-person post-debate show right now. If ESPN ever did this for Sunday NFL the earth would catch on fire.
BillSimmons	692917046900834304	2016-01-29T03:47:52	I recant my fake trade. Utah fans would riot if they traded Hayward. Back to drawing board. Schroeder for Hood is interesting...
BillSimmons	692915452494880769	2016-01-29T03:41:32	Teague/Korver for Hayward/Burke. That's the trade.
BillSimmons	692912978467930112	2016-01-29T03:31:42	I'd love to hear how the Knicks are going to get Jeff Teague with the non-Melo non-Zinger assets they have. Seriously I am all ears.
BillSimmons	692910133702172676	2016-01-29T03:20:24	Thanks to Phoenix for giving us an All-Star for the 27th pick in the 2016 Draft. Hugs and kisses to the Sarver fam! Much appreciated!

BillSimmons	690751314515496960	2016-01-23T04:22:01	3. The Cavs are paying nearly 50m this year for Love/Thompson/Mosgov/Varejao in a league where everyone is going small... That's not Blatt.
BillSimmons	690750606865117185	2016-01-23T04:19:12	2. But the Cavs have struggled behind the scenes for the entire Gilbert era ... they are paying 3 coaches right now for God's sake.

BillSimmons	688885528867946496	2016-01-18T00:48:03	An even more amazing push by Denver!
BillSimmons	688884655995502592	2016-01-18T00:44:35	Amazing Denver cover.  Also - onto Denver.
BillSimmons	688880926420414464	2016-01-18T00:29:46	Denver is an alligator blood team - hang around hang around hang around and suddenly they're winning. Shout out to Teddy KGB.
BillSimmons	688877152058486784	2016-01-18T00:14:46	Another atrocious call - how was that a touchback? We've seen like 8 inexplicable calls or no-calls in this game.
BillSimmons	688875865011126272	2016-01-18T00:09:39	What an atrocious no-call on Manning's slide for a self-sack. Steelers fans have to be going apeshit at the calls in this game.
BillSimmons	688874631508312064	2016-01-18T00:04:45	Wow, Pittsburgh just botched the last 4 plays about as badly as you can botch them. This is like 10 other ugly games Denver stole this year.
BillSimmons	688868913807888384	2016-01-17T23:42:02	Doesn't Manning have to start taking chances and throwing deep and/or over the extended middle? Pitt is sitting on everything else.
BillSimmons	688866533875912704	2016-01-17T23:32:34	Looks like PI to me...but what do I know? Ask Jay Feely. 
BillSimmons	688867022696923136	2016-01-17T23:34:31	Instead - CBS runs the dropped pass montage to make more excuses for Manning.
BillSimmons	688866221127684096	2016-01-17T23:31:20	CBS needs to run a montage of Aqib Talib's best uncalled pass interferences from this game.
BillSimmons	688853320920780800	2016-01-17T22:40:04	Pitt up 4, Tomlin fired up, Ben OK, Manning only completing short stuff, some Den drops, crowd nervous... Round 2 Upset Recipe in place!
BillSimmons	688841243426607104	2016-01-17T21:52:05	"They numbed the shoulder..." Translation - "They loaded him up with enough painkillers to take down a 4-person family..."
BillSimmons	688827746055667712	2016-01-17T20:58:27	This would be one of the greatest pushes of all-time.
BillSimmons	688825915585896448	2016-01-17T20:51:10	In hoops Russell Wilson would be like 11 for 29 FG with 11 assists, 9 rebounds, 4 steals and 9 turnovers right now.

BillSimmons	688778085571760129	2016-01-17T17:41:07	Solid contrarian case for Pitt upset today (Nobody Believes In Us, everyone teasing Den, etc) but I like this most.

BillSimmons	688459307398987776	2016-01-16T20:34:24	My other biggest fear for today...  
BillSimmons	688410567984283650	2016-01-16T17:20:44	Since 1960, the Pats have never lost a playoff game during a week when one of their stars were involved in a synthetic marijuana scandal.
BillSimmons	688407060837306368	2016-01-16T17:06:47	Biggest fear today: Brady's ankle. If he can't move around + KC collapses o-line, plus bad weather, could be an ugly 16-13 either/or game.
BillSimmons	688405951389372416	2016-01-16T17:02:23	Also - I'm horrifyingly confident about the finally healthy Pats whooping KC today. Hobbled Maclin, Kelce doubled, how does KC move ball?
BillSimmons	688405434319769600	2016-01-16T17:00:20	3. With that said - DFS needs to change its advertising and stop making it seem like normal people can win those huge money contests...
BillSimmons	688404884081606656	2016-01-16T16:58:08	2. My single-entry daily fantasy team for Round 2: Palmer, S. Jackson (sleeper), D. Johnson, Fitz, JJones, DThomas, Gronk, Floyd, Pats D.
BillSimmons	688404798782111744	2016-01-16T16:57:48	1. The DFS community sold me on single-entry contests not being rigged so I'm giving it a second chance b/c I enjoy daily fantasy...

BillSimmons	688172657137733632	2016-01-16T01:35:21	Actually - Antoine Walker's shot selection never killed Tommy Heinsohn so I think we're ok.
BillSimmons	688171797884186626	2016-01-16T01:31:56	I love Marcus Smart but his shot selection is going to murder Tommy Heinsohn.

BillSimmons	687506266436993024	2016-01-14T05:27:21	A 12-episode Season One of The OC would have been the greatest Netflix binge watch ever. I would have tried cocaine to finish it in 1 night.

BillSimmons	687140685800030208	2016-01-13T05:14:40	At least Kroenke paid for his own stadium - there isn't a dumber public expense than paying for part of an NFL stadium. What a waste of $$$$
BillSimmons	687139197941985280	2016-01-13T05:08:45	I'm just teasing. I feel bad for everyone in STL but the moment Kroenke bought that Inglewood land this was not ending any other way.
BillSimmons	687138555559198720	2016-01-13T05:06:12	Don't worry about potholes, drinking water or schools everybody - we are gonna have a new football stadium that we never asked for! WOO HOO!

BillSimmons	686049924597813249	2016-01-10T05:00:22	After watching that we can all come to the same conclusion: Thank God the NFL has spent $10 million to try and get Tom Brady.

BillSimmons	685880171069493248	2016-01-09T17:45:50	I love the idea of daily fantasy and hope they figure it out, but this jaycaspiankang piece was pretty damning.

BillSimmons	684774642125414402	2016-01-06T16:32:51	Kroenke's LA/NFL bid is going to win - Inglewood is a better spot and the NFL/West Coast epi-center sell is smart.

BillSimmons	684234907049054208	2016-01-05T04:48:08	It sucks to go to Carson for soccer games with 15,000 people. 75,000 in a football stadium? Good luck. Also, this college game is awesome.
BillSimmons	684233506759688192	2016-01-05T04:42:35	The good news is that, if they build the NFL stadium in Carson, it will be the single dumbest LA-related idea since I moved here in 2002.
BillSimmons	684231688839282689	2016-01-05T04:35:21	It's amazing how little everyone in LA cares about getting 2 NFL teams. This should go great.
