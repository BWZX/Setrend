JeremyClarkson	702564578845184001	2016-02-24T18:43:43	SamWTotter Looks like a V8 Moto Guzzi to me
JeremyClarkson	702249552196321284	2016-02-23T21:51:55	Filming starts here tomorrow morning. 8 sharp. 
JeremyClarkson	701185334571364352	2016-02-20T23:23:05	OiClarkson I'm so sorry about your Dad and for what you've been through. Rest assured, I'll carry on trying to make you laugh.
JeremyClarkson	701117919997128706	2016-02-20T18:55:12	If we do decide to leave Europe,  I just hope we go somewhere nice. Maybe the Caribbean.
JeremyClarkson	700816990559084544	2016-02-19T22:59:25	I hate to correct MailOnline but we will not be featuring Reliants in our new show. We simply use them as company cars.

JeremyClarkson	700087415512309761	2016-02-17T22:40:21	Seriously, it's better to play tennis after drinking beer than after drinking wine. Hope that helps.
JeremyClarkson	700082803879383040	2016-02-17T22:22:02	Sadly, I can't remember the final score. Fun though

JeremyClarkson	700062223889084417	2016-02-17T21:00:15	Quiet please. This is an important experiment. Who will win? The man who's been drinking beer. Or the man who's been drinking wine?
JeremyClarkson	700060176120807424	2016-02-17T20:52:07	This will go well 
JeremyClarkson	700059746124992512	2016-02-17T20:50:24	My male opponent has been on the Banks. I'm on the Leobe. Let's see what happens.
