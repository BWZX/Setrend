DanAmira	708311962824876033	2016-03-11T15:21:46	Trump gets much of his support from poor people. Out of the 50 poorest counties in America to vote so far, Trump has won *45* of them.

DanAmira	707027322608742402	2016-03-08T02:17:04	Polls show Hillary with false lead because some voters are ashamed to tell pollsters they're voting Trump.
DanAmira	707026620389920768	2016-03-08T02:14:16	One thing that would scare me about a Trump v Hillary general election is a "Bradley effect" in the polls creating an election day surprise
