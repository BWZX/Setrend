balajis	721412830730260480	2016-04-16T18:59:56	balajis it is why clearing/settlement initiatives have 5-10 year timeframes...
balajis	721417933071716352	2016-04-16T19:20:13	.balajis we could see more consortiums / guild and network based structures in the futures. Not dissimilar to open source paradigm change.
balajis	721423131949142016	2016-04-16T19:40:52	16/ Hard doesn't mean it's impossible. But consortium sales may prove to be the rate limiting step for private blockchain adoption.
balajis	721422081515069441	2016-04-16T19:36:42	15/ So, to sell private blockchain: - assemble a consortium - deal with consortia leverage as buyer - survive long sales cycles That's hard!
balajis	721420862444806144	2016-04-16T19:31:51	14/ Thus, even though banks have a lot of money, for these logistical reasons it may be hard to build a large private blockchain company.
balajis	721420099756789762	2016-04-16T19:28:49	13/ They have leverage - private blockchain only exists with consortia's cooperation! - so will be hard to sustain profits at their expense.
balajis	721419177861328896	2016-04-16T19:25:09	12/ Even if they do agree on a commercial vendor, consortia members won't want to create a monster like studios did with Netflix/iTunes.
balajis	721418430067245056	2016-04-16T19:22:11	11/ For similar reasons, it may be easier to get consortia to agree on a pure open source private blockchain than a for-profit option.
balajis	721417678544441344	2016-04-16T19:19:12	10/ That is, FB and Google compete on many things, but can cooperate on Linux as neither party can deprive the other of its contributions.
balajis	721417124841807872	2016-04-16T19:17:00	9/ So even if a consortium *does* agree on a private blockchain, pure open source options may dominate...as they are demilitarized zones.
balajis	721416506597187584	2016-04-16T19:14:33	8/ That is, if history of internet micropayments is any guide, everyone wants to be the troll on the payment bridge - browsers, OS, banks.
balajis	721416080451698689	2016-04-16T19:12:51	7/ Moreover, LTV may not be that high, as consortia may demand totally open source solutions (eg PostChain-like: ).
balajis	721415419425218560	2016-04-16T19:10:13	6/ So: oligopsonistic market (few large buyers w/ long sales cycles) means lots of leverage vs private blockchain vendors. CAC will be high.
balajis	721414871720419328	2016-04-16T19:08:03	5/ An additional factor: there are fewer consortia than enterprises. Hence the market is more oligopsonistic. 
balajis	721414571219505152	2016-04-16T19:06:51	4/ One inkling of this can be seen here:  
balajis	721414227013971968	2016-04-16T19:05:29	3/ Private blockchains are more desirable when there is less trust (eg auditability is a goal). But less trust makes consortium sale harder.
balajis	721412790561296384	2016-04-16T18:59:47	2/ If enterprise sales is getting a bill through Congress, consortium sales is passing an international treaty. 
balajis	721411744858447872	2016-04-16T18:55:37	1/ Private blockchains are only useful in the context of multiple economic actors. That's beyond enterprise sales. It's *consortium* sales.

balajis	714663521527529472	2016-03-29T04:00:35	ChrisSpoke mims Would be win/win if migrants lower their tax rates while recipient country increases its tax base. (And that's just tax.)
balajis	714663256103596032	2016-03-29T03:59:32	ChrisSpoke mims That's $100M in new tax base for destination city. Crowdchoice is the new collective bargaining of 21st century.
balajis	714663077887672321	2016-03-29T03:58:50	ChrisSpoke mims May happen long term. To start, easier to get 1000 devs with $100k salaries to negotiate a move with an existing state.
balajis	714634827924840450	2016-03-29T02:06:34	balajis mims think: tribal lands. Already have much of the sovereign rights necessary for a blank slate approach.
balajis	714662203052306433	2016-03-29T03:55:21	Noahpinion mims Yes. Quick version: at least some states want to attract tech. They'll make deals first. 
balajis	714661783533805568	2016-03-29T03:53:41	Noahpinion mims Anyway, should probably write this up as it's hard to tweet a paper :) Good chat as always!
balajis	714661563945193472	2016-03-29T03:52:49	Noahpinion mims In addition, your preferences have feedback effects with crowdchoice. See what vectors are popular, pick the closest one.
balajis	714661272961220608	2016-03-29T03:51:39	Noahpinion mims Many jurisdictions. Not all will perfectly match one's preferences. But choice gives better chance of a decent fit.
balajis	714660532242911232	2016-03-29T03:48:43	Noahpinion mims So, IMO already happening. The main remaining q: when will states start systematically molding policy to attract migrants?
balajis	714659647190212608	2016-03-29T03:45:12	Noahpinion mims Some of that is starting with eg nomadlist.io and  (which we set up).
balajis	714659513677193221	2016-03-29T03:44:40	Noahpinion mims That sorting process is very ad hoc right now because the tools aren't yet there to assist moves.
balajis	714658831352004608	2016-03-29T03:41:57	Noahpinion mims But we're already seeing the start. From tech cities to ISIS, people meet online &amp; meet up offline in greater s.
balajis	714657052413431808	2016-03-29T03:34:53	Noahpinion mims Exactly :) Social network reputation: solve defection. Crowd commitment: solve free rider. (Can't fit all in 140 chars.)
balajis	714656505681686529	2016-03-29T03:32:43	Noahpinion mims Good q. IMO answer is empiricism + collective action models like this:  
balajis	714654591225233408	2016-03-29T03:25:06	Noahpinion mims Moreover, as prescient as Tiebout was, he was focused on individuals alone vs crowdchoice to solve collective action prob.
balajis	714654137909059584	2016-03-29T03:23:18	Noahpinion mims That is, what Bewley is optimizing (a mathematical model of public goods) is not what mobile individuals will optimize.
balajis	714653618180206593	2016-03-29T03:21:14	Noahpinion mims In re Bewley's paper specifically, I don't think the "general equilibrium" result is important. 
balajis	714652871321460736	2016-03-29T03:18:16	Noahpinion mims Arguably the missing parts are "search jurisdictions" and "make money" from phone. Those are coming.
balajis	714652514646228993	2016-03-29T03:16:51	Noahpinion mims Today you can already book flights, call cars, buy food, rent lodging, send millions from your phone.
balajis	714651857063292928	2016-03-29T03:14:14	Noahpinion mims Theory from 35 years ago cited against smartphones that have brought us much closer to Tiebout is IMO not that persuasive.
balajis	714641467659014144	2016-03-29T02:32:57	Noahpinion mims Smartphones + internet make Tiebout assumptions true. See many old posts from 2014: 
balajis	714640857219993600	2016-03-29T02:30:32	Noahpinion mims Oh, I know all about Tiebout :)  
balajis	714634513016422401	2016-03-29T02:05:19	mims Big cos already have this kind of leverage with states: ask for concession to put a new factory there. Now, universalize that idea.
balajis	714633670993125376	2016-03-29T02:01:59	mims One idea: crowdchoice. Type your preferences in. Aggregate with millions of others. Collectively bargain with states. Then move.

balajis	714223674174234628	2016-03-27T22:52:48	kimmaicutler pmarca I think where we differ is: that's not a tax issue. It's an issue of regulations, incentives, competence.
balajis	714223220694487040	2016-03-27T22:51:00	aarieff The $0 refers to cost of decriminalizing innovation. Self-driving cars themselves will cost money, but private sector money.
balajis	714222736915111936	2016-03-27T22:49:04	aarieff Not zero cost. It's like the shift from USPS to email. Massively less cost in taxes for public sector, massively more innovation.
balajis	714222117550563329	2016-03-27T22:46:37	mims Yes. Maybe most important problem. Can't be naively "anti-government". Seek a better government. But through migration, not election.
balajis	714219223459897344	2016-03-27T22:35:07	balajis but I'd *love* Google to step in and say "you could have that (rail). OR you could have this. (self-driving)".

balajis	714220290234929152	2016-03-27T22:39:21	mims Agree. My quick answer: a good government makes the right tradeoffs for its citizens, with abuses checked by exit/emigration.

balajis	714217613421719552	2016-03-27T22:28:43	16/ But if you're a technologist who wants to innovate in transportation, look at the links in this thread. And then start looking overseas.
balajis	714216417202049024	2016-03-27T22:23:58	15/ If you're ideologically committed to the premise that USG can do no wrong, I don't hope to convince you. Keep doing what you're doing.
balajis	714214420008673280	2016-03-27T22:16:01	14/ In summary: US laws blocking construction do exist, their effects are not always good, and they increase price of basic infrastructure.
balajis	714213856038375424	2016-03-27T22:13:47	13/ Third, "moar roads" aren't even possible in the US. $787B meant nothing. Building fast &amp; cheap is illegal. 
balajis	714213605302886400	2016-03-27T22:12:47	12/ That is: self-driving cars, ride-sharing, drone delivery, and hyperloops take cars *off* the roads. Like email reduced need for postmen.
balajis	714213426654896129	2016-03-27T22:12:05	11/ Second, "moar roads" is to self-driving cars roughly what "moar postmen" is to email.
balajis	714213137671532544	2016-03-27T22:10:56	10/ First, roads aren't innovation. The Interstate Highway was innovative in 1950. Not anymore. Every country has roads. Table stakes.
balajis	714212683940147200	2016-03-27T22:09:07	9/ As for the non-sequitur of "moar ROADS", it's so dumb that it will require a few tweets to disassemble.
balajis	714212489194438656	2016-03-27T22:08:21	8/ So that's why if you want to build a hyperloop, you go abroad. Exit the US and the West.  
balajis	714211697158807552	2016-03-27T22:05:12	7/ If Obama + $787B can't build a bridge, how hard do you think it is to build a hyperloop?

balajis	714210273582649344	2016-03-27T21:59:33	6/ Point: it's not the cost of raw material that is driving the high price of US infrastructure. It's the cost of antiquated US laws.
balajis	714210084520210432	2016-03-27T21:58:48	5/ The less obvious result is that these laws push innovation in construction overseas. For example: 
balajis	714209798409965568	2016-03-27T21:57:39	4/ The obvious consequence is to increase the price of building basic infrastructure to the point of infeasibility.

balajis	714208773779300352	2016-03-27T21:53:35	3/ First, for specific laws hindering construction, this is a good overview.

balajis	712253077043032064	2016-03-22T12:22:21	JackGavigan In the same way, exit at the country level will show what alternative to the FDA/Big Pharma symbiote looks like. Buckle up :)
balajis	712252592760311809	2016-03-22T12:20:25	JackGavigan You might argue Uber was bad for taxi cos and taxi regulators. Very hard to say bad for public. Safety rationale was a facade.
balajis	712252060742209536	2016-03-22T12:18:18	JackGavigan Exit at city level within US showed that municipal taxi regs were *far* from Pareto-optimal. Essentially no downside to Uber.

balajis	701282942518054912	2016-02-21T05:50:57	A (perhaps obvious) thought: what about remotely piloted cars as an intermediate between Ubers and self-driving cars? Like drone pilots.

balajis	700136462520455169	2016-02-18T01:55:15	.rabois Precisely! Which is why Apple has to resist this as otherwise their global sales are imperiled (to mostly non-American customers).
balajis	700135960835547137	2016-02-18T01:53:15	.rabois To clarify: Apple is subject by virtue of being located in US, but foreign customers would not want FBI ordering Apple like this.
balajis	700127922477109248	2016-02-18T01:21:19	The FBI's request thus has global implications; among them, whether Apple's foreign customers are subjected to US surveillance.
balajis	700126743634399232	2016-02-18T01:16:38	For historical reasons Apple is located on US soil, but most of its customers are no longer American. Are they subject to US jurisdiction?

balajis	697359991821463553	2016-02-10T10:02:33	13/ That's where he's coming from. He wants India to rise &amp; have its pick of awesome tech. You may disagree on means, but probably not ends.
balajis	697359789723119617	2016-02-10T10:01:44	12/ And guys like pmarca are funding that, because they're very simply in favor of the best tech from the best technologists (many Indian!)

balajis	697358587396538368	2016-02-10T09:56:58	10/ It took till 1991 to realize markets were good for India. And what we found is that many Indians are really damn good at global markets.
balajis	697357939775041536	2016-02-10T09:54:23	9/ It took till 1991 till we finally started liberalizing &amp; shedding Fabian influence (itself a British holdover!) 
balajis	697357000502550528	2016-02-10T09:50:39	8/ Instead the (understandable) anti-colonialist overreaction threw out the capitalist baby with the colonialist bathwater.
balajis	697356719647756288	2016-02-10T09:49:32	7/ Throwing off the British yoke - good! But we could have done it like the US did and set up capitalism rather than Fabian socialism.
balajis	697356137193201665	2016-02-10T09:47:14	6/ So what was he saying? This: in the *name* of anti-colonialism, the British Raj was replaced by the License Raj. 
balajis	697354087671558144	2016-02-10T09:39:05	5/ Point: given that Indians run a sizable chunk of pmarca's own portfolio, it'd be crazy to think he was against Indians running India!
balajis	697352738368192514	2016-02-10T09:33:43	4/ He's hired, promoted, funded, &amp; supported Indian founders/CEOs all across tech, including Mixpanel/Instacart/etc. Deeds - not words.
balajis	697352284544434177	2016-02-10T09:31:55	3/ He's helped the careers of countless Indians in tech when others were fulminating about H1Bs.
balajis	697352084048326656	2016-02-10T09:31:07	2/ This is obvious to anyone who has &gt;140 characters of context, but pmarca is *OBVIOUSLY* pro-capitalist and anti-colonialist.

balajis	684310823905267712	2016-01-05T09:49:48	10/ Another is that there is significant overhead in placing bets of this kind. A pain to track/organize. Perhaps Bitcoin helps long term...
balajis	684310383859924993	2016-01-05T09:48:04	9/ This is for several reasons, but one is: journalism/academia are primarily status-based economies while VC/finance are $-based economies.
balajis	684310164510359552	2016-01-05T09:47:11	8/ These are interesting norms to compare.  "Conflict of interest" is norm in journalism/academia "Money where mouth is": VC/finance
balajis	684309787111116800	2016-01-05T09:45:41	7/ Competing norms. Conflict of interest: have financial stake? Less credible. Put money where mouth is: no such stake? Less credible.
balajis	684308603314962432	2016-01-05T09:40:59	6/ To get them to bet in the first place, though, need to get "put your money where your mouth is" back to a cultural norm.
balajis	684307731713359873	2016-01-05T09:37:31	5/ In realtime, the only answer seems to be ask them to bet their beliefs. Over the long term, this kinda works too: 
balajis	684306920887328769	2016-01-05T09:34:18	4/ The arguments usually begin with "it's bad because it's useless/a toy/etc" and end with "it's bad because it's too powerful".
balajis	684306330140545024	2016-01-05T09:31:57	3/ In any industry, there's usually not an "aha" moment where the haters admit they were wrong. They just sort of quietly retrench.
balajis	684305967119380480	2016-01-05T09:30:31	2/ They are both by the same guy. Yes, the arguments are self-contradictory. Surprisingly, doesn't matter. What is consistent is the *tone*.

balajis	683378106371973120	2016-01-02T20:03:31	Abstr_ct Yep! Trying to discuss with Truthcoin why Postgres support is important/complementary. See this thread:

balajis	683225691282751489	2016-01-02T09:57:53	arikaleph Well, with sufficient BTC that shouldn't happen. Enough to mirror the value of all internally conducted txs.
balajis	683222030842372097	2016-01-02T09:43:20	arikaleph Very similar to intranet as a trusted network vs Internet as untrusted network.  
balajis	683221046049148928	2016-01-02T09:39:25	arikaleph Absolutely right that private blockchains = internal trust. But not all private blockchains trust each other. Thus Bitcoin.

balajis	683210573639593984	2016-01-02T08:57:48	viksit I think it also relates to the problem. Private blockchain alone: pay trusted friends. Adding sync to public chain is big change.
balajis	683209599747375104	2016-01-02T08:53:56	viksit Yes, because it's mostly been talked about as a way to discuss Bitcoin without saying "Bitcoin". Few good public technical demos.
balajis	683207645977677825	2016-01-02T08:46:10	A very interesting idea. Devs, comments/thoughts? 
balajis	683209147538518016	2016-01-02T08:52:08	8/ If you build a good v0 of a PostChain and want to pursue it as an open source project, I will help fund it. Tweet at me w/ your demo!
balajis	683208067874332672	2016-01-02T08:47:51	7/ Of course, people running PostChain instances would need to bulk buy BTC to sync their txs to the public Blockchain. Feature, not bug!
balajis	683207534786707456	2016-01-02T08:45:44	6/ This then mirrors the "intranet, not Internet" debate. Blockchain w/o Bitcoin - private blockchain - is an intranet. Not totally useless.
balajis	683206878956933120	2016-01-02T08:43:07	5/ This unites the concepts of "off-chain" &amp; "private blockchain". A local DB of off-chain txs, periodically synced with Bitcoin blockchain.
balajis	683205237977399297	2016-01-02T08:36:36	4/ The key feature of a PostChain would  be the ability to periodically write a summary of off-chain transactions to the public Blockchain.
balajis	683204747877158912	2016-01-02T08:34:39	3/ PostChain would similarly be a Postgres extension that adds support for working with crypto and Bitcoin-related datastructures.
