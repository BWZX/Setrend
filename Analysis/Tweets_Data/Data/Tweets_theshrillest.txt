theshrillest	725040476068413441	2016-04-26T19:14:54	vjmsports yeah, that's pretty much exactly what I think. I think they could beat the Blazers but it wouldn't be *shocking* if they didn't
theshrillest	725039260378734593	2016-04-26T19:10:04	aczaj chrislhayes sure. the fact that some parts are fictionalized doesn't mean that all of it is, or vice versa.

theshrillest	725037121032040448	2016-04-26T19:01:34	chrislhayes eg. "Big Homie better grow up", when Jay-Z and others use that nickname for himself (he uses it on Crazy In Love, for instance)
theshrillest	725036878529961984	2016-04-26T19:00:37	chrislhayes well, that's good. anyway I think there are some references that are too specific to be coincidence

theshrillest	724718990388420609	2016-04-25T21:57:26	alexismadrigal and that's the best case. 2 weeks from now is when he's re-evaluated, not when he comes back necessarily

theshrillest	724717200049741824	2016-04-25T21:50:19	stuff like this Curry injury is why I said this: 
theshrillest	724713608345575425	2016-04-25T21:36:03	vjmsports yeah, right
theshrillest	724713507925544960	2016-04-25T21:35:39	vjmsports but if the Spurs win this year and, say, OKC wins next year, I think people remember this year differently, if that makes sense
theshrillest	724713397627936768	2016-04-25T21:35:13	vjmsports I meant in the NBA in general. Like if the Spurs won this year &amp; GSW won again next year, ppl will interpret this year one way
theshrillest	724711773916426241	2016-04-25T21:28:46	About Steph? I'm not. Obviously makes a title much much less likely, but I'm just glad it's not something worse  
theshrillest	724710381860483072	2016-04-25T21:23:14	vjmsports yeah. I guess how would be interpreted narratively for the Spurs would depend upon what happens over the next few years.

theshrillest	724705443092652032	2016-04-25T21:03:36	vjmsports I feel like it will be more viewed as a "what if/missed opportunity" scenario for Golden State, right? I don't know
theshrillest	724705098618667008	2016-04-25T21:02:14	vjmsports haha, I personally don't believe in asterisks, but nobody will ever question a Spurs title anyway

theshrillest	724689299304681472	2016-04-25T19:59:27	masaotaylor12 the team is still better on defense with Steph on the court, even if you only compare possessions w/Draymond off

theshrillest	724685185262977024	2016-04-25T19:43:06	theshrillest amended realistic best case is Clippers pull a Clippers, Portland wins in 7, and GSW wins with no Curry in 6
theshrillest	724686821196632064	2016-04-25T19:49:36	Nah. Warriors D is 7 pts per 100 possessions better with Curry on the floor. (for reference, 12 better w/Dray on). 
theshrillest	724685716479836160	2016-04-25T19:45:13	Curry-less Warriors getting the Clippers up outta here in 4 games would be as hilarious as it is unlikely. They'd have to disband LAC.

theshrillest	723521192435437569	2016-04-22T14:37:49	Very rarely. Anyone have an exact number? All I remember are Jordan and Hakeem winning MVP &amp; DPOY in the same year.

theshrillest	723519649111937028	2016-04-22T14:31:41	We see the kind of improvement that guys like McCollum make all the time. The amount that Curry improved is much more difficult.

theshrillest	719615511819132929	2016-04-11T19:58:02	This happens in America.  
theshrillest	719579193831514112	2016-04-11T17:33:43	Here's the long and short of how the Black Panther vs. Captain America fight ended in the books: 
theshrillest	719611039113809920	2016-04-11T19:40:16	MattBruenig okay, but I think the assumption of most people is that we're below and have been for awhile
theshrillest	719609141593935872	2016-04-11T19:32:43	MattBruenig but I think the actual goal is "we don't want to tip the playing field so much that it makes no sense to go to a private HBCU"
theshrillest	719608874857181184	2016-04-11T19:31:40	MattBruenig can't see why that matters, unless the goal is "we want all black people to go to HBCUs for sure"
theshrillest	719607978714800128	2016-04-11T19:28:06	MattBruenig seems like an odd place to take it. most direct result seems to me to find a way to fund private HBCUs
theshrillest	719606500285554688	2016-04-11T19:22:13	MattBruenig but I can't think of a reason it wouldn't go that way unless ppl who go to private HBCUs don't consider public colleges at all
theshrillest	719606205941882882	2016-04-11T19:21:03	MattBruenig whole bunch of things happening over that time period, I'm not sure you could get much insight from a simple time series
theshrillest	719605586862604288	2016-04-11T19:18:36	MattBruenig probably has, on the margin.
theshrillest	719603534493143040	2016-04-11T19:10:26	mlybollinger Noahpinion haha whoops
theshrillest	719602658231758848	2016-04-11T19:06:57	Noahpinion first reason she gives for why she can't vote bernie is that his support isn't broad enough
theshrillest	719601652815110144	2016-04-11T19:02:58	Noahpinion I always find "I'm not voting for candidate X because other people aren't voting for candidate X" to be a confusing argument
theshrillest	719595157205561344	2016-04-11T18:37:09	djolder yup, the whole thing is 100% scripted. very odd decision.

theshrillest	719587336531623936	2016-04-11T18:06:04	every time you publish these ham-fisted, under-edited articles abt black women you show your (lazy, irreverent) asses. do you not feel shame
theshrillest	719586504159404032	2016-04-11T18:02:46	maybe one day yall will consider (black) women's cultural productions legitimate enough to require actual REPORTAGE from, yaknow, reporters

theshrillest	719585102494359554	2016-04-11T17:57:12	I'm just gonna give up on seeing the day when black women's work is valued as highly as it should be. There will always be a "but".

theshrillest	719397681467039744	2016-04-11T05:32:27	Superman is a hard character to make work well, but the origin story is the easiest part to make good and compelling. And Snyder couldn't.

theshrillest	717760747908894720	2016-04-06T17:07:52	ayjayredux it's two totally different issues
theshrillest	717760675959799809	2016-04-06T17:07:35	ayjayredux thanks for your recent piece. I've been thinking about this exact same thing for a long time &amp; nobody really got it
theshrillest	717759214731415552	2016-04-06T17:01:46	@mliroff jbouie but if one campaign unilaterally decided that they were going to make their strategic decisions ignoring it, it'd hurt them
theshrillest	717758797825978368	2016-04-06T17:00:07	@mliroff jbouie that's what I mean by campaigns acting as if momentum matters. it probably doesn't matter on the margin bc of optimization

theshrillest	717754798347395072	2016-04-06T16:44:13	bballbreakdown he was, but steph didn't force the issue.
theshrillest	717754531958816769	2016-04-06T16:43:10	jbouie I'm just trying to understand your position. I think momentum is overrated but I think it exists because campaigns act as if it does
theshrillest	717754120371720192	2016-04-06T16:41:32	jbouie isn't it possible to imagine an election close enough so that it makes a difference between winning and losing?
theshrillest	717753851445510144	2016-04-06T16:40:28	jbouie why would they invest in one state more than another, though? and  if there is variation in individual state outcomes...
theshrillest	717753552991494146	2016-04-06T16:39:16	jbouie for instance? I can't see why they would if sequential order doesn't matter
theshrillest	717752691183648768	2016-04-06T16:35:51	JimmyDonofrio I agree that there should be more convincing studies by the CDC and the gun lobby's attempts to block research are shameful
theshrillest	717752206326243329	2016-04-06T16:33:55	jbouie so it wouldn't change the results in individual states, either, then
theshrillest	717751920559988736	2016-04-06T16:32:47	lkoturner I feel like I could guess who this is
theshrillest	717751272883888129	2016-04-06T16:30:13	jbouie so you think if we went through and reshuffled the primary schedule, the final results of the primary would be unchanged?

theshrillest	717748368454234112	2016-04-06T16:18:40	ASaltzberg I am under the impression that there is an explicit exception in the PLCAA for suing for negligence on the part of a seller
theshrillest	717746940729905152	2016-04-06T16:13:00	ASaltzberg sue the distributor for negligence, then
theshrillest	717745909824512000	2016-04-06T16:08:54	JimmyDonofrio that wouldn't remotely be close to the same thing even if true, &amp; the studies demonstrating this aren't very convincing
theshrillest	717745217709826048	2016-04-06T16:06:09	spollck but it's not true that the PLCAA proscribes suing gun manufacturers and firearms dealers
theshrillest	717743141277708288	2016-04-06T15:57:54	JimmyDonofrio gun manufacturers don't argue that you can't kill someone with a gun
theshrillest	717742645338988544	2016-04-06T15:55:56	spollck the standard definition of "on principle". like, "I don't like this set of results if it is allowed" is not a principle
theshrillest	717740537093038080	2016-04-06T15:47:33	spollck so there's no *principled* case
theshrillest	717740137656889344	2016-04-06T15:45:58	cestlah AmandaMarcotte yeah, because we passed laws dictating these things. if we want gun regulations, we should pass gun regulations
theshrillest	717739347072589824	2016-04-06T15:42:49	spollck that's fine: pass laws to make those things possible. suing manufacturers is backdoor gun control and everyone knows it
theshrillest	717739119137284096	2016-04-06T15:41:55	JimmyDonofrio can hold oil companies liable for oil spills, you can't hold them liable for, idk, pollution.
theshrillest	717738860441051136	2016-04-06T15:40:53	JimmyDonofrio there's no inconsistency. you can hold big banks liable for fraud, you can't hold them liable for people being greedy
theshrillest	717738323024850944	2016-04-06T15:38:45	spollck I disagree that "every single option should be on the table"

theshrillest	716764804375949312	2016-04-03T23:10:20	teeg_dougland MattBruenig it's reporting the opposite
theshrillest	716764712902402048	2016-04-03T23:09:59	ByYourLogic I'm sorry, couldn't read your tweet because I was blinded by the whiteness of your avatar. I'm sure it sucked though
theshrillest	716764264359288832	2016-04-03T23:08:12	teeg_dougland MattBruenig I'm unaware of any evidence that demonstrates that northern europeans are more likely to ID as immigrants
theshrillest	716763676129107968	2016-04-03T23:05:51	ByYourLogic typical remark from a guy with hashtags in his display name. what'd I even expect

theshrillest	716763024401371136	2016-04-03T23:03:16	ByYourLogic I love argument by flippancy, where you just say something glibly and let your disdain itself be the argument
theshrillest	716761363427696640	2016-04-03T22:56:40	MattBruenig and if so, uh, why
theshrillest	716761293701537792	2016-04-03T22:56:23	MattBruenig since trump's support is mostly white men, am I to conclude that it's southern european and Eastern europeans who love him
theshrillest	716759871882801152	2016-04-03T22:50:44	MattBruenig I'm.... confused.
