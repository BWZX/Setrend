jk_rowling	707231841581973504	2016-03-08T15:49:45	.ReadyFeddie As children, wizards often produce accidental magic when they feel strong emotion. Wands help control and channel this power.

jk_rowling	707230040744960000	2016-03-08T15:42:36	.ridd1kulus No, there was mutual respect and a sense of kinship between all wizards, no matter what their race.

jk_rowling	707229142866120705	2016-03-08T15:39:01	.egaand Interesting question. The wizards deny the right to bear wands to other categories of magical being. Some think that unfair.
jk_rowling	707228654594629632	2016-03-08T15:37:05	.o0MRG0o Yes, most wizards produce more precise magic by using the correct wand, which is why they've been widely adopted.
jk_rowling	707227439500562432	2016-03-08T15:32:15	.DreamingOfMagic No, there's a cultural tradition of using wands and broomless flight is (as you might imagine) very risky!

jk_rowling	707226426274086912	2016-03-08T15:28:14	.dwmw24601 bluesrgt Exactly. Wands and brooms (and flying cars) are tools that channel magic. The most gifted can dispense with them.

jk_rowling	707220859388305408	2016-03-08T15:06:07	.bluesrgt Yes, nearly all wizards use wands, which makes magic easier to channel. Wandless magic is sophisticated and takes more talent.
