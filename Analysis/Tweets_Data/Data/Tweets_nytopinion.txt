nytopinion	706648333234925568	2016-03-07T01:11:06	Many places, esp poverty areas, have even higher levels of lead poisoning than Flint does (from old paint and soil, not water).
nytopinion	706647993924067328	2016-03-07T01:09:45	Sanders is right: Flint residents paid the highest rates in the country while their water was poisoned

nytopinion	705591101621714944	2016-03-04T03:10:02	At the Republican debate, the metaphorical finally became literal. 
nytopinion	705590183371120640	2016-03-04T03:06:23	Trump is right that leaders need flexibility, including the right to change their minds. But critics are also right that he has no core.
nytopinion	705590280993574912	2016-03-04T03:06:46	I think Trump has a better sense of what "people really wanna know" than Kasich.  But I admire his idealism.
nytopinion	705589787210727424	2016-03-04T03:04:49	It's odd that Trump has a reputation as a straight shooter when Politifact attributes to him the "lie of the year" 
nytopinion	705590254674321408	2016-03-04T03:06:40	See. "You have to be flexible &amp; not be stuck if you find stuff out later." I bet that's appealing to many since everyone does change.
