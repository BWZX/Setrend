MaxAbrahms	717188027655843841	2016-04-05T03:12:05	What's the best analogy for the Daily Beast accusing anybody else of overselling the usefulness of the Syria rebels? 
MaxAbrahms	717182137200459776	2016-04-05T02:48:40	Obama reportedly vetoed 50 plans put to him by the CIA to engineer the downfall of the Assad government:

MaxAbrahms	717155764410814468	2016-04-05T01:03:53	Many Western media outlets ran their own version of that story line even though I kept telling them it was wrong:  .
MaxAbrahms	717155233378349056	2016-04-05T01:01:46	Suicide terrorism is always described as a clear-cut sign of "costly signaling" except when ISIS uses it against the Syrian military.

MaxAbrahms	717137702118957058	2016-04-04T23:52:06	NiceGuy2all DanielWickham93 There's a flattening effect on Twitter. You can never publish in peer review &amp; still be seen as a top scholar.
MaxAbrahms	717135678161756160	2016-04-04T23:44:04	Is there any media outlet in the world that's tried harder than the Daily Beast to sell the Syrian rebels?
MaxAbrahms	717129651513069568	2016-04-04T23:20:07	Widespread reports of fighting between ISIS &amp; SAA around DeirEzzour -- surely another PR stunt ruse after Palmyra &amp;  al-Qaryatain.
MaxAbrahms	717122261807992832	2016-04-04T22:50:45	Not sure if true, but reports are IS has used poison gas against a Syrian airbase in Deir Ezzor -- more evidence of the Assad-IS lovefest?
MaxAbrahms	717098379252219905	2016-04-04T21:15:51	After the Daily Beast accused the intel community of over-hyping the Syria rebels, ESPN has reportedly accused fans of over-hyping sports.

MaxAbrahms	717008519506079745	2016-04-04T15:18:47	Daily Beast writers were having trouble sleeping at night, so they blamed US intel for supplying a daily stream of ISIS nonsense to readers.
MaxAbrahms	717007163189813248	2016-04-04T15:13:23	Nothing is more ironic than the media calling out U.S. intel for overselling the moderateness, strength &amp; trustworthiness of Syrian rebels.
MaxAbrahms	717005587125551104	2016-04-04T15:07:07	I had access to the same Intel as the media and somehow managed to avoid supplying a daily stream of misinformation .
MaxAbrahms	717004139788681216	2016-04-04T15:01:22	U.S. intel has gotten a lot more right about ISIS than the media, which has supplied endless misinformation unseen since the Iraq war.
MaxAbrahms	717002964112642048	2016-04-04T14:56:42	Don't blame US intel; the media was so desperate to push regime change in Syria that it oversold the rebels as moderate, strong, useful etc.
MaxAbrahms	717000739793592320	2016-04-04T14:47:52	Is the Daily Beast reporting that U.S. intel got Syria wrong to excuse itself for supplying endless misinformation? 
MaxAbrahms	716999647424823296	2016-04-04T14:43:31	And now Daily Beast is reporting the US intel community got Syria wrong by making some of the exact same mistakes: .
MaxAbrahms	716997505343496192	2016-04-04T14:35:01	Russophobes have transitioned away from pretending Russia doesn't attack ISIS to assailing Putin's management of personal finances.
MaxAbrahms	716995557940707328	2016-04-04T14:27:16	Assad &amp; IS are such good friends that the Syrian military is attacking IS east, west &amp; north of Palmyra, just today .
MaxAbrahms	716993109163433984	2016-04-04T14:17:32	In what will surely be described in the Western media as another PR ploy, the Syrian army is attacking ISIS east, west &amp; north of Palmyra.

MaxAbrahms	716976583035199488	2016-04-04T13:11:52	The Daily Beast convinced many the rebels are a great US investment, Assad is pro-IS, Russia never targets IS &amp; indeed is "ISIS' air force."
MaxAbrahms	716975452439650306	2016-04-04T13:07:23	Nope, Daily Beast gets the award for getting less correct about Syria than any other media outlet:  .
MaxAbrahms	716972396872404994	2016-04-04T12:55:14	My only hypothesis is the US Intel community got Syria wrong because it was reading Daily Beast:  .
MaxAbrahms	716968007419961344	2016-04-04T12:37:48	Indeed, the Daily Beast has been insisting Russia is ISIS' "Air Force" and the rebels are a terrific US investment: .
MaxAbrahms	716966436959350784	2016-04-04T12:31:33	In addition to getting everything wrong about Syria did Daily Beast get the date of April Fools wrong too?

MaxAbrahms	716963893545930752	2016-04-04T12:21:27	How ironic, there's no media outlet I've seen with a worse record on getting the basic facts right on Syria:  .
MaxAbrahms	716961760276783104	2016-04-04T12:12:58	Is there anything more ironic than the Daily Beast accusing others of overselling the quality of the Syria rebels? 
MaxAbrahms	716960341645721601	2016-04-04T12:07:20	How ironic -- Daily Beast is itself responsible for spreading bogus info on the rebels &amp; other key aspects on Syria .
MaxAbrahms	716958387884396549	2016-04-04T11:59:34	Sorry, no media outlet has done a worse job getting the basic facts right on Syria than the Daily Beast: .
MaxAbrahms	716956282108907520	2016-04-04T11:51:12	It's ironic for Daily Beast to report on US intel failures against IS when its own reporting has been SO badly off: .

MaxAbrahms	716830101833441280	2016-04-04T03:29:48	Actually, my understanding is the Palmyra residents overwhelmingly prefer Assad to ISIS:  .

MaxAbrahms	716761645033267200	2016-04-03T22:57:47	Does terrorism work as a political strategy? The evidence says no 
MaxAbrahms	716794186696167424	2016-04-04T01:07:06	If a pundit insists Russia never targets ISIS &amp; attacks Putin over the PanamaLeaks chances are he's just anti-Russia &amp; not an ISIS expert.

MaxAbrahms	715181412043911168	2016-03-30T14:18:30	When Assad loses Palmyra the media says it's ipso facto evidence of supporting IS. When after 7 months he reclaims Palmyra it's a PR stunt.
MaxAbrahms	715179737396723714	2016-03-30T14:11:51	If the Syria rebels were actually helpful against ISIS then ISIS wouldn't suffer MORE when the rebels are restrained under the ceasefire.
MaxAbrahms	715178402337198080	2016-03-30T14:06:33	In retrospect it's clear helping the rebels in Syria has been a net negative against IS. That's why we see IS suffering after the ceasefire.
MaxAbrahms	715174414845943809	2016-03-30T13:50:42	The ceasefire has enabled Assad to focus on IS by restraining the rebels. Imagine if the West &amp; Gulf had never supported the rebels at all.
MaxAbrahms	715167812524707841	2016-03-30T13:24:28	A humanitarian case for removing Assad can be made. But selling regime change by saying he's an ISIS supporter is an empirical disgrace.

MaxAbrahms	715161485740216321	2016-03-30T12:59:19	Western media outlets are torn between saying Russia never attacks ISIS &amp; Russia has violated its promise to leave Syria by attacking ISIS.

MaxAbrahms	715143173077614592	2016-03-30T11:46:33	From the start Assad always wanted to hit ISIS harder. The ceasefire has finally allowed him to direct his resources squarely against ISIS.

MaxAbrahms	715118352390352896	2016-03-30T10:07:56	Most countries wouldn't have supported the ceasefire had they known it would enable Assad to crush IS, weakening the case for regime change.
MaxAbrahms	715114206614433793	2016-03-30T09:51:27	Are regime change fans more upset that Assad is crushing ISIS because they insisted it would never happen or because it weakens their case?
MaxAbrahms	715112416351293440	2016-03-30T09:44:20	Assad began crushing IS the moment he could, when the ceasefire freed up his military. Regime change fans are now upset he's gone after IS.

MaxAbrahms	714933791601639424	2016-03-29T21:54:33	Typical Western media coverage -- Assad's trouncing of ISIS in Palmyra is called  "fantastic public relations coup." 
MaxAbrahms	714922451025731586	2016-03-29T21:09:29	It's often said that cooperation is essential for counterterrorism success but in Syria disparate parties are harming ISIS quite separately.

MaxAbrahms	714901307564367872	2016-03-29T19:45:28	Now that the strategic case for regime change has taken a hit after Palmyra, regime change fans rely more heavily on the humanitarian case.
MaxAbrahms	714900618876489728	2016-03-29T19:42:44	The problem for regime change fans is the strategic argument fell after Palmyra &amp; the humanitarian case is questionable after Iraq &amp; Libya.
MaxAbrahms	714898586736189440	2016-03-29T19:34:39	The main argument for regime change was Assad helps ISIS.  Anyone know how regime change salesmen will make the case now for toppling him?

MaxAbrahms	711251408708878336	2016-03-19T18:02:04	KyleWOrton Since Russia started shaming Turkey about the border crossings, the ISIS superhighway hasn't been as bad. Even you must agree.

MaxAbrahms	711250484649136128	2016-03-19T17:58:24	KyleWOrton At the least, we can say that since Russia intevened in Syria, ISIS has increasingly struggled across numerous metrics.

MaxAbrahms	711249388132237312	2016-03-19T17:54:03	KyleWOrton Russian intervention has been in the aggregate highly correlated with ISIS problems in Syria, partly because of Russian moves.
MaxAbrahms	711248677319401472	2016-03-19T17:51:13	KyleWOrton Russia has hit many non-IS targets. That's not in dispute. But Western media has repeatedly belittled Russian help against IS.
