schulte_stef	700799666292543488	2016-02-19T21:50:35	cleonrin Well, but recent financial crisis has done very real damage to many economies. In my opinion, addressing moral hazard top priority

schulte_stef	700797884250218497	2016-02-19T21:43:30	cleonrin According to some papers, big banks might be inefficient, if cheaper refinancing due to TBTF didn't exist:

schulte_stef	699008682768666624	2016-02-14T23:13:51	iainross101 BarterisEvil Well, local banks (coop. banks, community banks) originated from a similar idea. Knowledge of local econ is key.

schulte_stef	698985678168690688	2016-02-14T21:42:26	schulte_stef I think some form of shadow banking would occur but regulatory and political approaches allowed it to grow too big.
schulte_stef	698983418130993152	2016-02-14T21:33:28	BarterisEvil When it comes to SME lending, I think local banks are really better suited than almost any other model.

schulte_stef	698951022581063681	2016-02-14T19:24:44	BarterisEvil Unhealthy business models in banking might create negative "external effects", so to speak - they need to be internalized.
schulte_stef	698950199310417921	2016-02-14T19:21:28	BarterisEvil Higher capital requirements for large banks might be a good start, but we would need ways to address shadow banking as well.
schulte_stef	698949932410081280	2016-02-14T19:20:24	BarterisEvil I think we would need regulations that discourage (not necessarily forbid) those less healthy business models.
schulte_stef	698949011982655489	2016-02-14T19:16:44	BarterisEvil Ownership matters, too - shareholders (especially non-local ones) often seem to push for high short-term returns.
schulte_stef	698948758315339777	2016-02-14T19:15:44	BarterisEvil True not just for the asset side, but for liabilities as well (non-local funding might lead to more irresponsible lending).
schulte_stef	698948440689090560	2016-02-14T19:14:28	BarterisEvil I think it's generally easier for banks that are focused on regional business (&amp; don't compete nationally or internationally).
schulte_stef	698943477837651968	2016-02-14T18:54:45	BarterisEvil If, on the other hand, lending and other forms of financing create  unsustainable bubbles =&gt; crash, broken virtuous cycle

schulte_stef	698464423162331136	2016-02-13T11:11:09	StatEconomist Of course, there seem to be issues, e.g. "Bitcoin system has been subjected to various security breaches", according to paper

schulte_stef	698289763342753792	2016-02-12T23:37:07	paulallchorne To me, seems as if there's still a lot of risk taking going on in financial markets. If huge crash, no bailouts? Not sure.
schulte_stef	698285849213952000	2016-02-12T23:21:34	paulallchorne At first, yes, but the question is how much moral hazard bailouts created &amp; whether this might cause a similar crisis again.
schulte_stef	698283518309330944	2016-02-12T23:12:18	paulallchorne ... but how did we end up in a situation where that was possible? (2/2)

schulte_stef	698281898129408000	2016-02-12T23:05:52	paulallchorne Not sure, but maybe, directly helping out pensioners in need would have been a better solution than bailing out all the banks
schulte_stef	698280251751796737	2016-02-12T22:59:20	paulallchorne We probably need some "safe" place to put money, but at the time, investors were also searching for yields =&gt;should take loss
schulte_stef	698278710265442304	2016-02-12T22:53:12	paulallchorne MarkCalabria Well, a lot of that was wholesale funding, not traditional retail deposits, as far as I know.

schulte_stef	698273033811861510	2016-02-12T22:30:39	MarkCalabria paulallchorne Banks as a whole are protected. However, very strong preventive measures are in place (to avoid moral hazard).
schulte_stef	698272308260118528	2016-02-12T22:27:46	MarkCalabria paulallchorne This is why our coop. banks have their (self-organized) institutional protection scheme.
schulte_stef	698270863930617856	2016-02-12T22:22:01	MarkCalabria paulallchorne On the other hand, if deposits were lost, this could wipe out many otherwise healthy SMEs.
schulte_stef	698270281081737216	2016-02-12T22:19:42	MarkCalabria paulallchorne True, and there can be moral hazard, too. Icelandic bank Kaupthing attracted lots of German deposits pre-crisis

schulte_stef	696754493896138755	2016-02-08T17:56:31	iwasid Frances_Coppola Well, regulators didn't require much equity in the past. Thus, many big banks had very poor leverage ratios.
schulte_stef	696753964528877568	2016-02-08T17:54:24	iwasid Frances_Coppola Of course, anatadmati's reasoning. Capital requirements for big banks can help adress TBTF - agree with her there

schulte_stef	696752518194446336	2016-02-08T17:48:40	iwasid Frances_Coppola Well, this is exactly why regulators should care about capital at TBTF banks as long as investors don't.

schulte_stef	696643591960186880	2016-02-08T10:35:49	paulallchorne This is quite possible, even if the German cooperative banking sector in general had relatively few "toxic" assets.
