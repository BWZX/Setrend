LondonerVince	690645785126572032	2016-01-22T21:22:41	Spain - Rajoy rejected mandate to form gov't. King Felipe VI will therefore start new round of talks with political parties on Wednesday.
LondonerVince	690636463181029385	2016-01-22T20:45:38	JeremyCliffe Yup, definitely not easy. Good to exchange views. Have a good weekend!
LondonerVince	690635865060708352	2016-01-22T20:43:16	JeremyCliffe True. Point is PSOE-Podemos still not enough for majority, Sánchez would need Catalan separatists to at least abstain. Tricky.
LondonerVince	690634366540709888	2016-01-22T20:37:19	JeremyCliffe Totally agree. But there are other factors at play, including some PSOE bigwigs potentially interested in ditching Sánchez.
LondonerVince	690631256254586882	2016-01-22T20:24:57	JeremyCliffe Very different narrative. Grand coalition would be only chance to avoid new elections, and PSOE responsible for forcing them.

LondonerVince	690617009428697089	2016-01-22T19:28:20	Spain - Rajoy speaking now, essentially saying he still wants to be PM but currently lacks necessary support in parliament.

LondonerVince	690601688399482880	2016-01-22T18:27:27	Spain - Mariano Rajoy is to be designated PM this evening. He currently looks very unlikely to be able to form a government.

LondonerVince	690503172708765696	2016-01-22T11:55:59	IdafeMartin Exactly, so he needs Catalan parties NOT to vote against (i.e. abstain), right? NickMalkoutzis
LondonerVince	690499940229988354	2016-01-22T11:43:09	Spain - King Felipe VI also due to meet Rajoy and Sánchez today. Tricky choice ahead: will he by-pass Rajoy and designate Sánchez new PM?
LondonerVince	690498605749243908	2016-01-22T11:37:51	Including Catalan separatist parties, which would be problematic for PSOE.
