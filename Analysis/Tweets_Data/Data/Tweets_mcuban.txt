mcuban	721024509327716352	2016-04-15T17:16:53	bencasselman the big question is why are there fewer IPOs.  Is it from VCs  trying to retain control longer or the SEC  screwing things up?
mcuban	721023019808763904	2016-04-15T17:10:58	bencasselman either way, there is less competition. More concentrated wealth. Fewer employees w stock options  Less dynamic stock market
