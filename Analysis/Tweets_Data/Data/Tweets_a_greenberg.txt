a_greenberg	676016818545426432	2015-12-13T12:32:23	exiledsurfer BiellaColeman Sure, but in the public interest to know.
a_greenberg	676015790441676800	2015-12-13T12:28:18	exiledsurfer BiellaColeman Do you believe in climate change? Wright doesn't seem to. What if he had $435m to back that view?

a_greenberg	676009221272506373	2015-12-13T12:02:12	exiledsurfer Yes, but what if the ones attached to his actual identity weren't?
a_greenberg	676008543468847104	2015-12-13T11:59:31	exiledsurfer We wanted to be first, yes. I never had ambitions for a book deal, figured that would go to Satoshi's chosen biographer.
a_greenberg	676005481786302465	2015-12-13T11:47:21	exiledsurfer Sure, but we know very little about Satoshi, and that makes more knowledge about him/her newsworthy.
a_greenberg	676003062167805953	2015-12-13T11:37:44	exiledsurfer (We also pointed out in the story that Wright seemed to want to be identified as Satoshi, was dropping breadcrumbs for us.)
a_greenberg	676002371122655232	2015-12-13T11:34:59	exiledsurfer Agreed that's a tough balance. But Satoshi isn't the world's only rich person with this problem.
a_greenberg	676001088433209344	2015-12-13T11:29:53	exiledsurfer Money = potential power and influence in the hands of a person, and who that person is matters.
a_greenberg	675998645691490304	2015-12-13T11:20:11	exiledsurfer I'd argue that IDing a secret, enormous fortune would be revelation of potential power and influence in the public interest
