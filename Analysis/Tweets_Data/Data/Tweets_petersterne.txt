petersterne	711032123180851200	2016-03-19T03:30:43	mattbuchanan And ironically, the fed judge who initially denied Hogan's motion is same one who ruled against her in Schiavo case.
petersterne	711031914656874496	2016-03-19T03:29:53	mattbuchanan Some speculated the scrutiny she got in Schiavo case may have made her less sympathetic to press/more sympathetic to Hogan.

petersterne	702679446315253762	2016-02-25T02:20:09	tmcgev Yup. It would raise privacy concerns but it's technically public. You could probably get a J-school to store it.
petersterne	702679301511122944	2016-02-25T02:19:35	tmcgev You'd basically be creating a free, open-source version of listenfirst
petersterne	702678695375405056	2016-02-25T02:17:10	tmcgev Then you'd need to develop open-source data journalism tools to analyze all that data &amp; cross-reference it with other databases.
petersterne	702678380475449344	2016-02-25T02:15:55	tmcgev You need to create an independent searchable database/archive of tweets, something like the Sunlight Foundation but for Twitter.
petersterne	702674929410576385	2016-02-25T02:02:12	tmcgev Maybe a non-profit journalism/transparency org will invest in creating in the tools and giving them to journalists.
petersterne	702674813001854977	2016-02-25T02:01:45	tmcgev The last thing you want is to empower journalists to fact-check the information and analysis you're selling.
petersterne	702674597565624322	2016-02-25T02:00:53	tmcgev Unfortunately, there's no incentive to do so. If you have those tools, you want to maintain monopoly on them &amp; sell data to clients.
petersterne	702673187948122112	2016-02-25T01:55:17	petersterne I think someone needs to give journalists the same tools the best campaigns use. And use the same data to report off publicly

petersterne	702668649031667714	2016-02-25T01:37:15	tmcgev The problem is that sentiment analysis is pretty unreliable. There aren't good metrics to measure online support.
