FrankBruni	696318063021592576	2016-02-07T13:02:17	Yes, but the candidate who supplanted him--Marco Rubio--no doubt wishes he hadn't. 
FrankBruni	696315970546176000	2016-02-07T12:53:58	Interesting, contrarian take. Find these because media mob loves memes which don't mean much to primary voters

FrankBruni	696158495125725184	2016-02-07T02:28:13	Triply strange about Rubio tonight is that he's been looser, less programmed, DEFT on the trail over recent days. So why the robot now?

FrankBruni	696146235586179072	2016-02-07T01:39:30	Kasich is supposed be a possible N.H. surprise. He was almost left backstage. He hasn't received a chance to speak.
FrankBruni	696145009649807360	2016-02-07T01:34:38	Why is Rubio, just accused of repeating the same line over and over, responding by repeating the same line over and over? Plain weird.
FrankBruni	696143393253097472	2016-02-07T01:28:13	Cruz's trail refrain is how untrustworthy the media is, but his defense of what happened in Iowa is that he was trusting the media
