JustinPulitzer	725418635133632513	2016-04-27T20:17:34	Yes, FB should provide some FANG relief after 5-6 days of selling &amp; option pinning! 
JustinPulitzer	725417114555813890	2016-04-27T20:11:32	Beast mode! 
JustinPulitzer	725416507174432768	2016-04-27T20:09:07	That is a blow-out! 
JustinPulitzer	725416074741714945	2016-04-27T20:07:24	I mentioned FB is likely the reason for GOOGL woes as they’re taking market share as transitioning into Social &amp; Mobile… that’s now fact!
JustinPulitzer	725415317707563008	2016-04-27T20:04:23	FB BooooMM! Trim &amp; trail near ref highs, but she could &amp; should make new ATH
JustinPulitzer	725415041059672064	2016-04-27T20:03:18	johnnyt74 Looks like higher after hours.
JustinPulitzer	725412223259127808	2016-04-27T19:52:06	I concur 
JustinPulitzer	725411748547813376	2016-04-27T19:50:13	jarredtrax About the same $7.17ish
JustinPulitzer	725411425582206976	2016-04-27T19:48:56	FB Expected move into Friday Exp is $7.54 
JustinPulitzer	725411229485903876	2016-04-27T19:48:09	MOC paired down a bit $460M to Buy now. 19/30 DIA stocks are to the buy side though.
JustinPulitzer	725406739244408832	2016-04-27T19:30:18	MOC is $600-$700M to Buy
JustinPulitzer	725397356154335232	2016-04-27T18:53:01	TLT seems to be voting for Lower4Longer off that 2X bottom range lows 
JustinPulitzer	725395663735930881	2016-04-27T18:46:18	ironspader (cont) I’d prob do smaller size since breadth is mixed. Not as clean that way IMHO.
JustinPulitzer	725395434181636096	2016-04-27T18:45:23	ironspader Yes for RORO w/ tight leash because it eliminates the “secure high” RORO short.
JustinPulitzer	725394989333753856	2016-04-27T18:43:37	Shake N’ Bake isn’t just a down move… it’s a panicky flush like move… there is a distinct difference w/ regard to “capitulation”.
JustinPulitzer	725393923468873728	2016-04-27T18:39:23	jeffhksar88 Not panicky… no shake n’ bake. I you want to play long, short OTM puts sub $100 should be “ok”. Smaller size though IMHO.
JustinPulitzer	725392924440203267	2016-04-27T18:35:24	ES_F bulls need $2088.25+ to get the upward move to ‘stick’.
JustinPulitzer	725387410671058947	2016-04-27T18:13:30	I’m going to discuss Fed Decision / statement Today on Periscope at 4:45PM… should be enlightening compared to the TV nonsense.
JustinPulitzer	725386808184438788	2016-04-27T18:11:06	IDK why these guys &amp; gals on TV are talking JUNE, it’s SEPT that matters.
JustinPulitzer	725386527551983621	2016-04-27T18:09:59	Watch DX_F … it’s a Doji now… today’s range is VERY key… SPY range too.
JustinPulitzer	725386331891847168	2016-04-27T18:09:13	(cont) Big issue still Sept firmly being on the table now at 59% prob of a hike… watching how that closes though. 
JustinPulitzer	725384985197318146	2016-04-27T18:03:52	I’d like to hear more about Global Risks, but Fed acknowledges slowing growth… Prob more Dovish than Hawkish, but really just a punt IMHO.
JustinPulitzer	725382290889674752	2016-04-27T17:53:09	XOM hiking it’s dividend!! Such a BOSS move… BUT fishy given they report on Friday. Flatten up ahead of the print IMHO.
JustinPulitzer	725381266183458819	2016-04-27T17:49:05	balkdog81 That’s part of the inflation expectations
JustinPulitzer	725381013023645696	2016-04-27T17:48:05	What I’m listening for in FED Decision: 1) Foreign risk outlook 2) Inflation expectations 3) Mention of neutral Fed Funds Rate &amp; gradualism.
JustinPulitzer	725370420866736128	2016-04-27T17:05:59	cgasparino realdonaldtrump Really? I think it’s spot on… sure, he’s not used to teleprompters, but the content is great.
JustinPulitzer	725369891658719233	2016-04-27T17:03:53	amzn is not a tech stock. It's not even in the tech sector. It's actually the largest component of Consumer Discretionary sector. Not Tech
JustinPulitzer	725369994062749697	2016-04-27T17:04:17	dougkass He must have been long Weekly Calls.
JustinPulitzer	725368988209942529	2016-04-27T17:00:18	balkdog81 TLT held the lower end of the support range… below there is trouble, prob to trend. Hold means higher. 
JustinPulitzer	725367961255555072	2016-04-27T16:56:13	angry197 Not necessarily. Metals below Pre-Market high. DX_F is at lower end of range. Dollar is very key here. Rally would hurt them all.
JustinPulitzer	725366370498662401	2016-04-27T16:49:54	TLT Rate hike probability in Sept is at 51%… VERY key to see where it is post FOMC decision. The higher this is, the worse it is for stocks
JustinPulitzer	725363945389838339	2016-04-27T16:40:15	howo3579 Beats was ok IMHO. It was cheap &amp; a god brand to own. They need to go further though IMHO.
JustinPulitzer	725357180489179136	2016-04-27T16:13:22	travelingcoolie IDK, I just know it’s better than buying back a lot of stock. They need another profit center. Sub model is great for that.
JustinPulitzer	725356393197387780	2016-04-27T16:10:15	JustinPulitzer ETSY moving up nicely today. Breakout coming
JustinPulitzer	725356925253201920	2016-04-27T16:12:22	lukebrinker anncoulter VERY poor strategic move by Lyin’ Ted… Leaves Kasich &amp; Rubio open to Trump if he comes up short into the convention
JustinPulitzer	725356373404450816	2016-04-27T16:10:10	AAPL needs to build out their cloud products, gaming &amp; sub services. They’d own the world buying NFLX &amp; expanding it sub model into music.
JustinPulitzer	725351752120295425	2016-04-27T15:51:48	reformedbroker She’s part of the Cruz campaign from what I understand. She’s endorsed him.
JustinPulitzer	725350032069767168	2016-04-27T15:44:58	LC still holding trend. I still have my tester long on. 
JustinPulitzer	725349513007915008	2016-04-27T15:42:54	crowestk I’d be into buying a dip post print near 50MA or on MoMo over those $43s poor highs.
JustinPulitzer	725346374867365888	2016-04-27T15:30:26	mark4124nh reddogt3 Hope so! I want to reload some names I booked profits in.
JustinPulitzer	725343485826617345	2016-04-27T15:18:57	An old trick I use for Fed days is to see how SLV is trading in relation to GLD ahead of Fed. SLV tends to be the tell for metals.
JustinPulitzer	725342104919113729	2016-04-27T15:13:28	jarredtrax I guess it’s looking a bit better. I have to see the close and how it trades for a few days though. $96.69 was a gap fill.
JustinPulitzer	725341449949208576	2016-04-27T15:10:52	Closing those short WMB puts I mentioned a while back… .05. :)
JustinPulitzer	725340026448547841	2016-04-27T15:05:13	CL_F bearish inventory data into $45 resistance… not a surprise. Also, had a lot of chasing fan fair this morning.
JustinPulitzer	725339539519188992	2016-04-27T15:03:17	jarredtrax Puts may save AAPL this week. I think $95 is high OI. That will be fun to play against on Friday.
JustinPulitzer	725339081132105729	2016-04-27T15:01:27	jarredtrax I’ll be surprised if it doesn’t close on the lows.
JustinPulitzer	725338750172205057	2016-04-27T15:00:08	jarredtrax Not in my opinion. I think it has lower to go… eventually that gap will fill, but it may take a while.
JustinPulitzer	725338624271761408	2016-04-27T14:59:38	brian_fey jack IDK, I’d like to believe in Jack… he just hasn’t given us a reason yet.
JustinPulitzer	725338126365908996	2016-04-27T14:57:40	.Jack should make a statement buy of TWTR. Put in a floor &amp; put his money where his mouth is (so to speak). Pull a Steve WYNN move.
JustinPulitzer	725337467520430081	2016-04-27T14:55:03	NFLX is behaving pretty well today given the FANG &amp; QQQ weakness. Still watching that for a set-up.
JustinPulitzer	725336355040022529	2016-04-27T14:50:37	I’d prefer to start those types of operations around $680s. Channel low is very possible.  
JustinPulitzer	725335181335339008	2016-04-27T14:45:57	Not loving the price action. $40.28+ was the breakout… close below there is a stop out. They report tomorrow btw. 
JustinPulitzer	725333891398008832	2016-04-27T14:40:50	I’m astonished w/ FANG + AAPL down this much, Nasdaq Breadth isn’t even 2:1 Negative.. that’s truly incredible. cc PeterReznicek
JustinPulitzer	725333206124384256	2016-04-27T14:38:07	I agree w/ that thesis. I think they’re taking from GOOGL too. Prefer short OTM puts to shares though. 
JustinPulitzer	725332693773357056	2016-04-27T14:36:04	martychargin It’s very possible… However, FB has a secular shift of advertising dollars into Social &amp; Mobile.
JustinPulitzer	725332298787348481	2016-04-27T14:34:30	Buying back some creamed Short 23DTE $75 OTM XOM Puts for .05. Will sell $83 or below on dips now to reload those.
JustinPulitzer	725328918375501824	2016-04-27T14:21:04	Will SPY go higher or lower after the FED Decision Today at 2PM?
JustinPulitzer	725324106258874369	2016-04-27T14:01:57	raj570 Well, that wouldn’t good… question is how much the stock is already down into that report. If already down $5 or $6… not so bad.
JustinPulitzer	725322053734244353	2016-04-27T13:53:48	Careful early btw, I think Algos will run a lot of stops in both directions today.
JustinPulitzer	725321575210356736	2016-04-27T13:51:54	Fingers crossed for FB to trade “sloppy” / “Panicky” before print. That’s what’s required for Shake N’ Bake set-up… can’t be too orderly.
JustinPulitzer	725319568734953472	2016-04-27T13:43:55	JPMarketMovers (cont) So far in balance awaiting 2PM FED Decision. Prob a lot of chop &amp; head fakes ahead of decision. I like trading post.
JustinPulitzer	725318904747282432	2016-04-27T13:41:17	JPMarketMovers Impressed by the broad market’s resilience given AAPL weakness. CL_F &amp; XLE plays are  in vogue as air comes out of FANG.
JustinPulitzer	725318644092272641	2016-04-27T13:40:15	peterreznicek Yeah, IV in AAPL got crushed immediately :( … nothing in the 2DTE look good to me. Maybe a Put Ratio later though. :)
JustinPulitzer	725314319248941056	2016-04-27T13:23:04	So far, almost all of the morning question I'm getting on Twitter, DM &amp; Email are XLE. Careful chasing, but trend &amp; 200MA is BTD territory.
JustinPulitzer	725309580033548290	2016-04-27T13:04:14	bjj15843 I like RORO Longs on trend or 200MA tests. XLE
JustinPulitzer	725308108164182016	2016-04-27T12:58:23	I like XLE on dips as long as 200MA &amp; trend holds. 
JustinPulitzer	725307778269626368	2016-04-27T12:57:04	Dan1010101010 I've liked XOM CVX BP XLE. Getting harder to chase up here, but I like them for BTD.
JustinPulitzer	725148581057957889	2016-04-27T02:24:28	DallasMD They should just buy P, Spotify, Coachella &amp; Burning Man. They'd be rocking it hard. I'd also like to see them snap-up NFLX.
JustinPulitzer	725135389342715906	2016-04-27T01:32:03	This should have been a given for AAPL to scoop up.

JustinPulitzer	725125866741702662	2016-04-27T00:54:13	lytleAir CNBC AAPL needs to start doing something to get to the next level or it's in danger of being MSFT.
JustinPulitzer	725112899635650561	2016-04-27T00:02:41	Yes, I've been discussing this rotation. I've been more Oily than Techy lately. 
JustinPulitzer	725112246167306241	2016-04-27T00:00:06	Wow, AAPL is getting murdered and ES_F is only down $4.75. Can that really be?!?
JustinPulitzer	725111809435402241	2016-04-26T23:58:21	plo888 techinsidr FB has come in a bit, I'm hoping it's down a lot more tomorrow ahead of the print to sell puts (an earnings like move).
JustinPulitzer	725068255082242048	2016-04-26T21:05:17	Biggest problem AAPL has now is coming analyst estimate cuts, people who own from higher and wrong &amp; lack of catalysts until WWDC in June.
JustinPulitzer	725065832011804673	2016-04-26T20:55:40	thedaves37 techinsidr That’s assuming you believe the numbers… they just missed &amp; lowered guidance. AAPL

JustinPulitzer	725058224286629888	2016-04-26T20:25:26	TWTR the key will be to see if RTH LOD is higher or lower than AH LOD and then play RORO against that. Curious to hear the call too.
JustinPulitzer	725057711109472256	2016-04-26T20:23:23	They need an adult to come in am manager… like Eric Schmidt did for GOOGL &amp; Sheryl Sandberg did for FB.

JustinPulitzer	725049410112069634	2016-04-26T19:50:24	nickvitani It really could… problem is there is a little time until WWDC &amp; no iPhone until Sept.
JustinPulitzer	725048818555838470	2016-04-26T19:48:03	gordansrt It is, but it’s not panicy… I like when it gets steep on panic… not so orderly. Smaller size for sure if trying IMHO.
JustinPulitzer	725048588418596865	2016-04-26T19:47:08	AAPL I think a “buy stop” over today’s HOD is ok for RORO long… it really shouldn’t get back over if it’s really Bearish.

JustinPulitzer	723222049896960000	2016-04-21T18:49:08	Bears are very excited, but selling-off in a liquidation-break fashion &amp; w/ breadth that’s really not scary yet. More of a meow than a roar.
JustinPulitzer	723219820657913858	2016-04-21T18:40:16	johnnyt74 Obviously it’s still has $100 sellers &amp; getting hit on LVS. I like it long, but from lower since it’s miles from fibs.
JustinPulitzer	723219493019881473	2016-04-21T18:38:58	jakecatskill They’re up huge from my entry… a little pullback is ok.
JustinPulitzer	723201797414903808	2016-04-21T17:28:39	ES_F intra-day poor lows are being repaired begrudgingly. Breadth is still barely negative &amp; Ticks mixed. Careful chasing the dragon at LOD
JustinPulitzer	723195543590150144	2016-04-21T17:03:48	Everyone looking at charts thinks they’re a technician lately. I’m good at parallel parking, I guess I can drive in the Indianpolis 500 too.
JustinPulitzer	723194604779102208	2016-04-21T17:00:04	danielray83 If you like, long Vs. $94.20 RORO is okay in my book… but it’s a little shaky. If it snaps, prob $85s.
JustinPulitzer	723193188559818753	2016-04-21T16:54:27	arcovanahealer Most people are scared to be alone / step-out of the shadow of consensus. That’s why there’s so much mediocrity in the world
JustinPulitzer	723192300294299649	2016-04-21T16:50:55	arcovanahealer That’s a good thing though… over crowded boats sink! I’m used to being out on the edge all on my own 
JustinPulitzer	723191059732422656	2016-04-21T16:45:59	arcovanahealer I would be in the something’s wrong camp if we see $204s again so soon. Below $208.97 &amp; $206.84-.76 would have me cautious.
JustinPulitzer	723189644343533569	2016-04-21T16:40:22	ArcovanaHealer We spent 10 days consolidating &amp; tested $204s so many times. Seems like they held-up big time to my eye.
JustinPulitzer	723188170855198721	2016-04-21T16:34:30	Travelingcoolie Yes, 3 day lows have to hold for the late to the party crew.
JustinPulitzer	723187191879458816	2016-04-21T16:30:37	travelingcoolie I was considering it, but want people to guess… I really am curious what the %s are.
JustinPulitzer	723187099554439168	2016-04-21T16:30:15	NFLX update. Only long set-up I see is if you think y’day was a “secure low”. So, long vs y’day LOD is valid, but GTFO or Short below IMHO.
JustinPulitzer	723186496430346240	2016-04-21T16:27:51	plo888 I just did a poll… curious to see what the results are. Take it &amp; you’ll see the answer when it completes in 24 hours. :)
JustinPulitzer	723186222957531136	2016-04-21T16:26:46	plo888 I like the trade Vs. y’day HOD as a stop.
JustinPulitzer	723186033681137664	2016-04-21T16:26:01	Is SPY toppings here or will she see a new all time high soon? SPX
JustinPulitzer	723185358343680001	2016-04-21T16:23:20	plo888 Tape is a bit extended &amp; can pullback, but it’s so close to ATH that it seems likely to test eventually IMHO.
JustinPulitzer	723184714501201924	2016-04-21T16:20:46	travelingcoolie I don’t consider y’day a Shooting Star. It overlaps w/ prior day’s range. Short against HOD as temp “secure high” is valid.
JustinPulitzer	723184077826871296	2016-04-21T16:18:14	plo888 (cont) I can understand playing Short against y’day HOD as potential “secure high” short term, but I don’t think $186s are playable.
JustinPulitzer	723183885392158720	2016-04-21T16:17:29	plo888 You sure are! Short term it could fill this most recent gap, but the tape is pretty strong on trend break. 
JustinPulitzer	723182705639362560	2016-04-21T16:12:47	My updated SPY Chart: 
JustinPulitzer	723181711224410112	2016-04-21T16:08:50	plo888 I’m not really seeing that kind of bearishness in the charts… the tape is actually pretty Bullish.
JustinPulitzer	723180744714141697	2016-04-21T16:05:00	So far it’s a little liquidation break. At some point we’ll see a larger one, but SPY $210-$211 really big level. 
JustinPulitzer	723159181130383360	2016-04-21T14:39:19	commodoredfw I’m long via short $25 puts. Basically 3X bottom, but into 50MA resistance. Coin flip right here IMHO. 
JustinPulitzer	723154748690554880	2016-04-21T14:21:42	ES_F VWAP &amp; POC is up at $2096… that’s the pass / don’t pass line here for intra-day direction IMHO.
JustinPulitzer	723154517932564480	2016-04-21T14:20:47	ES_F Tweezers… my fave set-up. Watch $2093.5 VAL.  Over &amp; hold is good… below is still iffy.
JustinPulitzer	723150656849207296	2016-04-21T14:05:26	SPY $210-$211 has been resistance for years now… sorry, but it’s not going to just smash through w/o a fight.

JustinPulitzer	723146808801812480	2016-04-21T13:50:09	commodoredfw (cont) I think the set-up could be to sell OTM puts on a decline &amp; IV pop though.
JustinPulitzer	723145741854711808	2016-04-21T13:45:54	commodoredfw Keep in mind There’s still this quarter &amp; 1 more before iPhone7. WWDC is coming, but not much there after. Could be choppy.
JustinPulitzer	723145491484127232	2016-04-21T13:44:55	ES_F early liquidation break on mixed breadth… As usual, Bears trying early. S1 seems like a key level to my eye. 
JustinPulitzer	723144793849761793	2016-04-21T13:42:08	AAPL below $107s could be looking for $102-$103s… meds to get back over $108 to neutralize.
JustinPulitzer	723144177706516480	2016-04-21T13:39:41	JPMarketMovers ES_F opened in value w/ mixed ON Inventory. Should be choppy! Bulls need 2100.5+ for more. Bears need to break 2093.5-2090.
JustinPulitzer	723138912470851584	2016-04-21T13:18:46	JohnDoss1 SPY ramped, so yield is down. TLT has remained strong b/c of Fed policy. 'Significantly' higher bond yields would hurt stocks.
JustinPulitzer	723137474843779072	2016-04-21T13:13:03	NickLonginov Yes, 200MA gets a lot if Media fanfare, but it's not as playable as 50 &amp; 100MAs

JustinPulitzer	720342144389660672	2016-04-13T20:05:25	FB closed a little softer than I’d have liked to see, but good enough to keep the dream alive. Careful on any sustained closes below 50MA.
JustinPulitzer	720340962929729536	2016-04-13T20:00:43	So… who’s down from Periscope LIVE Q&amp;A? That’s going to happen at 4:45PM Today.
JustinPulitzer	720337501798404096	2016-04-13T19:46:58	FIT is a pretty bullish pattern here… I’d be surprised if there’s not continuation. 
JustinPulitzer	720336759834427392	2016-04-13T19:44:01	I’m shocked the Wall Street machine didn’t bring this one public just in-time for the collapse… that’s the usual MO 
JustinPulitzer	720336474361741313	2016-04-13T19:42:53	dougkass Yeah, what’s up with that… no SEC investigation. I think over HOD will see a new all time high.
JustinPulitzer	720334585062637568	2016-04-13T19:35:22	FB over HOD is a long… plain english.
JustinPulitzer	720334476908212225	2016-04-13T19:34:57	FB blasting back over 2 day highs… apparently the whole slowdown thing was a mistake. LOL DUH!!
JustinPulitzer	720333501736882177	2016-04-13T19:31:04	MS trend line break today. 
JustinPulitzer	720332711664029696	2016-04-13T19:27:56	ES_F channel has worked all day 
JustinPulitzer	720332309124280322	2016-04-13T19:26:20	The best way to manage risk is to start right at order entry via trade location &amp; position size. Study
JustinPulitzer	720329213409107968	2016-04-13T19:14:02	FB close is important today… better if it holds the prior day lows &amp; 50MA.
JustinPulitzer	720328101838905345	2016-04-13T19:09:37	WFM found bids sub $30 once again…
JustinPulitzer	720327906820423682	2016-04-13T19:08:50	priteshbhushan AGN is Allergan.
JustinPulitzer	720291564279488512	2016-04-13T16:44:25	BO = Break Out 
JustinPulitzer	720285322702155776	2016-04-13T16:19:37	Intraday VWAP has been very important as has trend since the spike pullback low. ES_F intra-day chart. 
JustinPulitzer	720285121295872000	2016-04-13T16:18:49	Poor highs were repaired &amp; now a liquidation break in a low confidence market… some iffy comments about Oil meeting are the “why”.
JustinPulitzer	720284724330016768	2016-04-13T16:17:15	superboogieman I think the Instagram acquisition will be looked back on as one of the biggest steals of all time.
JustinPulitzer	720284538648326144	2016-04-13T16:16:30	ES_F intra-day is pretty correlated w/ CL_F
JustinPulitzer	720283794704633857	2016-04-13T16:13:33	superboogieman LOL Not sure about that comparison. Instagram is killing it &amp; SnapChat isn’t really making much money.
JustinPulitzer	720283361298817024	2016-04-13T16:11:50	thejoyofcomedy IV will catch a bid as she gets closer to earnings… I’ll prob sell some OTM puts into a down move.
JustinPulitzer	720282366569279488	2016-04-13T16:07:53	thejoyofcomedy Let’s see how she closes. 50MA is key. Today has potential for outside day… so, prob wise to give it a few days to washout.
JustinPulitzer	720281329070403584	2016-04-13T16:03:45	That is my favorite earnings set-up… I hope it continues. Shake out all the weak handed chasers. 
JustinPulitzer	720281018557550596	2016-04-13T16:02:31	Intra-day downgrade news about ad spend hurting FB.
JustinPulitzer	720279851257720832	2016-04-13T15:57:53	thedaves37 I like the play, but there’s not that much juice. Maybe a put ratio of sorts.
JustinPulitzer	720277672505516032	2016-04-13T15:49:13	Let’s see the close. 50MA was support &amp; now 20MA &amp; trend resistance.  
JustinPulitzer	720277259274162177	2016-04-13T15:47:35	I think a little caution into 2PM Beige Book warranted if SPY is on highs. Liesman will find something Hawkish to crow about.
JustinPulitzer	720276688437907456	2016-04-13T15:45:19	Put Ratios are  good into down moves when IV is high since it’s net short premium. Spreads are better w/ low IV. 
JustinPulitzer	720275300920102912	2016-04-13T15:39:48	Looks like SPY Bulls have a gap &amp; go on our hands… 
JustinPulitzer	720274156164628480	2016-04-13T15:35:15	peterreznicek Yes, stock has been an oinker. Curious to see if y’day was look below &amp; fail or not. I bought 100 shares, window shopping.
JustinPulitzer	720273624117207040	2016-04-13T15:33:08	Looks bullish… Inverse Head &amp; Shoulders…  
JustinPulitzer	720272726276104193	2016-04-13T15:29:34	Nibbled a smidgen LC $7.5. LOD is prob my stop. Just a tester to get me involved &amp; interested… will add over $7.75. cc PeterReznicek
JustinPulitzer	720272316723294208	2016-04-13T15:27:56	Safety plays are getting smoked! MO Risk on names getting love AMBA
JustinPulitzer	720271331338645504	2016-04-13T15:24:02	dbconover1 Let’s see how it closes. I’m a little skeptical still. Over today’s HOD tomorrow could be a trade.
JustinPulitzer	720264645324455936	2016-04-13T14:57:27	CMG still awful. Thinking another trend touch as long as she’s below $453s-$454s. Back over gets interesting again. 
JustinPulitzer	720264022646472704	2016-04-13T14:54:59	CL_F finding her sea legs again… which is nice! Flirting w/ green.
JustinPulitzer	720263761525870592	2016-04-13T14:53:57	I love how the weakness in ALKS gets lapped-up w/ the quickness.
JustinPulitzer	720263648581656576	2016-04-13T14:53:30	crowestk I think that gap fill will be a good RORO spot. It’s right at trend too… but realize it may not stop it. Tape is i Bulldog mode.
JustinPulitzer	720263480729841664	2016-04-13T14:52:50	AMBA 50MA was the spot… now we know for future reference to play it accordingly. I’m long via short puts. 
JustinPulitzer	720263247165853696	2016-04-13T14:51:54	AMBA!!!! BoooooMM
JustinPulitzer	720262906189889536	2016-04-13T14:50:33	IWM Depends on your timeframe… but it’s already through on 1st timeframe.  
JustinPulitzer	720260321982550019	2016-04-13T14:40:17	ES_F highs look a bit poor to my eye… getting a little liquidation break. 50 period MA on 15 min chart is key here. 
JustinPulitzer	720259102140690432	2016-04-13T14:35:26	CL_F getting a little slippery here… ES_F seems to be keying again intra-day.
JustinPulitzer	720259092007284736	2016-04-13T14:35:23	ALKS early weakness bought again… impressive PA. Consolidation is healthy.
JustinPulitzer	720257904184393728	2016-04-13T14:30:40	JustinPulitzer Calls active too:from Open Outcrier..$BABA May 80 Calls Active with ~4,500 trading including a 3,000 sweep from 2.85 to 2.90
JustinPulitzer	720258240131559424	2016-04-13T14:32:00	Bearish CL_F read on the heals of a big run, but she’s firming nicely… and DX_F is strong today. Impressive PA.
JustinPulitzer	720256295840935937	2016-04-13T14:24:17	BABA is a gap above the downtrend line in the consolidation. LOD is a great stop to play long against. 
JustinPulitzer	720252890561044480	2016-04-13T14:10:45	(cont) $210.83 is 50% Fib. I just feel it’s a bit close to all this recent price action, but could sell OTM puts. 
JustinPulitzer	720252516374450176	2016-04-13T14:09:16	I’m looking at $180.27 (61.8% Fib) and $134.66ish… that completes the Head &amp; Shoulders measured move. $133 was BO 
JustinPulitzer	720251744056422400	2016-04-13T14:06:12	commodoredfw Thanks for pointing it out. I sold puts when it tested into $20s… worked really fast. I actually was worried about being early
JustinPulitzer	720250776715546624	2016-04-13T14:02:21	travelingcoolie Agree, the strongest!
JustinPulitzer	720249845974507521	2016-04-13T13:58:39	FB is looking like a bit of a shake n’ bake to 50MA as discussed in my Weekend Review Video… was pretty mild (so far).
JustinPulitzer	720249435305828352	2016-04-13T13:57:01	AAPL looking above trend again after a mild back-off… which is good price action (so far). 
JustinPulitzer	720249152446316544	2016-04-13T13:55:54	AMBA acting like a Mexican Jumping bean. Up 1 day, down the next. I’m still short puts as a long proxy (2nd round of puts, which is nice)
JustinPulitzer	720248835658932224	2016-04-13T13:54:38	I’ve been saying long $585+… $619.45 &amp; $635.35 are the upside refs I see. Can use a stop below LOD. AMZN 
JustinPulitzer	720248454815985668	2016-04-13T13:53:07	AGN getting the smack down… problem is stand alone valuation was already at fair value. Tons of deal arbs in there &amp; chasers still puking.
JustinPulitzer	720248180823031808	2016-04-13T13:52:02	It’s calculated from the Prior Day’s range… I still had it on my charts from y’day though. :) 
JustinPulitzer	720247675283730432	2016-04-13T13:50:01	Breadth isn’t all that impressive. 2.2:1 Positive on NYSE…. 3.4:1 Positive on Nasdaq
JustinPulitzer	720245840460324864	2016-04-13T13:42:44	European bank nibbles I mentioned are paying off well. Everyone assumed lows would break, I said in Weekend Review Video I assume they hold.
JustinPulitzer	720244145688854529	2016-04-13T13:36:00	ES_F Y’day POC was $2045.5… that’s where VWAP was too &amp; would take back y’day rich close… important levels to mark for future reference.
JustinPulitzer	720243697628114944	2016-04-13T13:34:13	JPMarketMovers ES_F gapping above highs of 10 days following Yellen’s speech. Keep an eye on SPY $206.76, above is Bullish, below is iffy
JustinPulitzer	720242746636836864	2016-04-13T13:30:26	Beige Book today at 2PM… although everyday feels like a Fed Day w/ all the loose lipped Fed Heads.

JustinPulitzer	720236525062131712	2016-04-13T13:05:43	Everyone "knew" banks were going to disappoint. JPM good reaction on earnings (so far). European banks 'should' act like Nasdaq versions.

JustinPulitzer	720017035581906945	2016-04-12T22:33:33	HSeemanNC They might not like it, but I don't think they have any other choice. I've thought he'd win ever since he announced.
JustinPulitzer	720015514827927554	2016-04-12T22:27:30	HSeemanNC I think it's actually an easy answer, but makes for some spirited conversation &amp; debate.
JustinPulitzer	720012710444982273	2016-04-12T22:16:22	Who will be the Republican nominee for President? (Not who you want to win, but who you think actually gets it.)
JustinPulitzer	720011796942319616	2016-04-12T22:12:44	IronSpader IMHO the strange move was selling-off the last 3 days on positive internals... algos are busy bees hunting stops.
JustinPulitzer	719986623556030468	2016-04-12T20:32:42	VRX bond holders are trying to call for technical default for delayed financials… of course, they want to snap up the assets on the cheap!

JustinPulitzer	719979302566174720	2016-04-12T20:03:36	Seems like it wants higher. I guess long Vs. 50MA. 
JustinPulitzer	719979184722964480	2016-04-12T20:03:08	Many days it does… it really matters when it’s in size… $1B+. Not so much of a factor if it’s under $500M. Cheers! 
JustinPulitzer	719978542235312128	2016-04-12T20:00:35	TV Reporters seem to think the risk in Oil is to the downside… no wonder it’s been ripping &amp; will continue to do so.
JustinPulitzer	719977451502313473	2016-04-12T19:56:15	MOC DIA 27/30 on the Sell Side into the bell. I think it’s about -$306M overall.

JustinPulitzer	719957231823929344	2016-04-12T18:35:54	mikewehrhan Me too! I think 1st press into the gap will back off though.
JustinPulitzer	719956492032610305	2016-04-12T18:32:58	mikewehrhan It was down a lot more earlier… taking a break along w/ the rest of Biotech. Thanks Obama! Now trying to block Teva deal too.

JustinPulitzer	719954130878492672	2016-04-12T18:23:35	NYSE is 6:1 positive today… that’s something! Nasdaq is only 2:1 Positive though.

JustinPulitzer	719948393485856768	2016-04-12T18:00:47	Well let’s see, Oil now getting there from a higher low. 1st 200MA breach since my Barmitzvah! 
JustinPulitzer	719948049343193089	2016-04-12T17:59:25	johnnyt74 Any company that buys YHOO will have to write it down soon after… not a good idea IMHO.
JustinPulitzer	719947932376674306	2016-04-12T17:58:57	johnnyt74 Core business is shrinking and will never reverse course IMHO. Why would anyone pay up for no growth? So many much better deals
JustinPulitzer	719947568990593028	2016-04-12T17:57:31	FB Messenger is going to be the new “Inbox” IMHO.
JustinPulitzer	719945109782048768	2016-04-12T17:47:44	johnnyt74 I’m not a YHOO fan. I don’t think it deserves any real premium… quite the opposite actually.
JustinPulitzer	719936116875468800	2016-04-12T17:12:00	jaschhibber Yes, was a short set-up for a pullback.
JustinPulitzer	719914484186406913	2016-04-12T15:46:03	ES_F Tweezer tops at $2051.25… not sure it stops it, but it’s a RORO set-up to test.

JustinPulitzer	719910355829436416	2016-04-12T15:29:38	johnnyt74 Ideally trend, but not sure that’s going to happen anytime soon. 20MA has been some near term RORO support. I prefer 50MA though
JustinPulitzer	719907598594654208	2016-04-12T15:18:41	Just like I thought $25+ was a sell, I think $20ish is a buy ZG.
JustinPulitzer	719907419200102400	2016-04-12T15:17:58	johnnyt74 Looks ok… getting so deserved pullback after doubling &amp; getting back to the breakdown point.

JustinPulitzer	718164719081820161	2016-04-07T19:53:06	MOC $300M to Buy… nothing exciting, but a sell bias would have probably cratered the tape.
JustinPulitzer	718164104851103744	2016-04-07T19:50:40	Bulls better get their sorry butts back above SPY $204 hard deck by the close or it’s going to be sketchy &amp; vulnerable.
JustinPulitzer	718164018570117121	2016-04-07T19:50:19	I was very clear… marissamayer made a BIG TIME rookie move by not selling all of their BABA stake at the IPO.

JustinPulitzer	718128991425675264	2016-04-07T17:31:08	plo888 Markets tend to top RTH… not in after hours or pre-market. I think there’s reference supply up here to work off though. We’ll see!
JustinPulitzer	718113201561407489	2016-04-07T16:28:23	jakecatskill Not always, but often. :)
JustinPulitzer	718112718176256000	2016-04-07T16:26:28	jakecatskill That’s correct… but I’m trying to keep it a bit simple for character count sake.
JustinPulitzer	718111601027637248	2016-04-07T16:22:02	Breadth incrementally getting worse, but it’s not full-on selling… feels like a soggy hangover, liquidation break. SPY $204 is VERY key.
JustinPulitzer	718107157875580928	2016-04-07T16:04:22	zarelli (cont) very possible SPY is consolidating in a range… so, not making too much of it yet, but it’s a bit eyebrow raising (2/2).
JustinPulitzer	718106850294644737	2016-04-07T16:03:09	zarelli Friday was a successful test of $204s and a big reversal day back up… that was fine… now back down testing the last 3 days. (1/2)
JustinPulitzer	718106011719057408	2016-04-07T15:59:49	zarelli I’ve been thinking consolidation &amp; higher. However, Tuesday &amp; Today really shouldn’t have happened. SPY $204 is key strike to hold
JustinPulitzer	718103320288690176	2016-04-07T15:49:07	AAPL dealing w/ trend rejection hangover. $109s are an important level to hold. I’ll consider $107-$109 hold “ok”. Below isn’t IMHO.
JustinPulitzer	718102950170771457	2016-04-07T15:47:39	WYNN testing above trend &amp; old support at $100. Prob going higher, but a good spot to trim, trail &amp; hedge IMHO 
JustinPulitzer	718102349974282240	2016-04-07T15:45:16	lytleair Wasn’t planning on it… but it’s hard to sleep well if European banks are burning down again.
JustinPulitzer	718101988790177792	2016-04-07T15:43:50	I think it’s very possible, but let’s see how se reacts to a pullback here… $265 is a VERY big level. 
JustinPulitzer	718101409967771648	2016-04-07T15:41:32	DB &amp; CS charts look pretty sickly (again). Better be 2X bottoms or we could have Black swan type of risk / talk entering the lexicon again
JustinPulitzer	718091483648229377	2016-04-07T15:02:05	Yes, still long ALKS. I have great entry, so tying to ride it for a test into the gap. It’s moved a lot already. 
JustinPulitzer	718083971108773890	2016-04-07T14:32:14	ES_F testing below $2041.5. If that sticks, $2035 &amp; $2028.75 are next levels of support I see… if it’s a look below &amp; fail, could be LOD
JustinPulitzer	718083832323379200	2016-04-07T14:31:41	TSLA $265+ was the spot to sell… I told ya so!
JustinPulitzer	718083254981640192	2016-04-07T14:29:23	On up days everyone seems to chase… and on down days they puke up what they bought the previous day… Low confidence chasers.
JustinPulitzer	718080222386647041	2016-04-07T14:17:20	ES_F gap was in middle of value… testing VAL $2043.5. If Market is healthy, it’ll hold &amp; rotate back up to VAH $2060.5. Below $2041.5 iffy.
JustinPulitzer	718079130844151808	2016-04-07T14:13:00	VWAP / POC rejected… Bulls need to get on the right side of those bad boys or the chop will continue. ES_F
JustinPulitzer	718077814466023425	2016-04-07T14:07:46	NFLX has been holding $103.88… as long as it does, it can go higher… that said, $106.61 is 50% $110s a big ref too 
JustinPulitzer	718077250202107904	2016-04-07T14:05:32	SPY feels like responsive sellers being worked off from touches into upper distributions / past breakdown points… which is to be expected.
JustinPulitzer	718074577180602368	2016-04-07T13:54:55	FB back-off from $116s was pretty mild. I know everyone wants to buy it lower on a dip, but since she’s $110.65+ the play has been long.
JustinPulitzer	718073675325521921	2016-04-07T13:51:20	I’ve been thinking higher &amp; playing long. 
JustinPulitzer	718072470922727424	2016-04-07T13:46:32	Breadth just barley on wrong side of 1:1 negative… not impressive selling &amp; ON inventory is 95% net short… Should see some rebalance / chop.

JustinPulitzer	717789460402974726	2016-04-06T19:01:57	I still like IBB on dips as long as 50MA holds. $290-$306 should be some near term resistance though.
JustinPulitzer	717787954735943680	2016-04-06T18:55:58	ES_F trying for a secure pullback low here. 200MA 15min is the level to play long against here IMHO. Below RORO short.
JustinPulitzer	717783939105075201	2016-04-06T18:40:01	harmongreg I think after SUNE &amp; VRX blow-ups, the bloom is off all of the “special genius” roses.

JustinPulitzer	717781276011458560	2016-04-06T18:29:26	SPY $205.23-$205.25ish+ would be a good close. Below is less conclusive.
JustinPulitzer	717777380799029248	2016-04-06T18:13:57	I see it as a liquidation break off poor highs…. little shake out. Must go home flat crowd is ending their chase. 
JustinPulitzer	717776755516436480	2016-04-06T18:11:28	Fed min are being taken as a bit Hawkish (inept), but less relevant to me given the Yellen speech. SPY

JustinPulitzer	707976665234808832	2016-03-10T17:09:25	jarredtrax The mistake he made in the Presser was that he isn’t planning on reducing rates further. So… lower 4 longer, but not low enough.
JustinPulitzer	707976244663590912	2016-03-10T17:07:44	jarredtrax European QE isn’t good for USA really other than stopping a Global Recession. It’s really only good for Europe.

JustinPulitzer	707960886019940353	2016-03-10T16:06:43	That is true. Bear Markets don’t usually allow anyone but the true believers / innovators in. 
JustinPulitzer	707960678242521088	2016-03-10T16:05:53	commodoredfw Breadth isn’t nasty. Barely 2:1 negative on Nasdaq &amp; not even that bad on NYSE.

JustinPulitzer	707956822263603200	2016-03-10T15:50:34	VIX $17.85… that’s the key here. Bears need to hold it, Bulls need to really break it &amp; hold below it.
JustinPulitzer	707954381128409088	2016-03-10T15:40:52	To my eye “selling the news” &amp; booking profits on expected ECB move. Doesn’t look like hardcore liquidation or shorts really leaning… yet
JustinPulitzer	707949940245454848	2016-03-10T15:23:13	XOM got into some reference resistance &amp; is coming off. Also, CVX CEO has been aggressive speaking to the press.

JustinPulitzer	707941812292460544	2016-03-10T14:50:55	mikeharrisny I don’t think they should take any Refugees. They already have crappy economies &amp; loaded in debt. Why import terror to boot?!?

JustinPulitzer	700753737183264769	2016-02-19T18:48:04	However, big pattern is iffy. It’s a lower high &amp; below consolidation range. So, break of those MAs has room. (2/2)

JustinPulitzer	694391362808995841	2016-02-02T05:26:16	People are always talking about GOOGL buying TWTR, but a better buy is ZG IMHO. cc spencerrascoff
JustinPulitzer	694383527434010624	2016-02-02T04:55:08	johnnyt74 I expect GILD solid numbers, but IBB weakness &amp; peak earnings has hurt Biotech stocks. I think bounce, but don't fall in love.
JustinPulitzer	694382164255834113	2016-02-02T04:49:43	JakeCatskill We'll see. CVX was awful, but bounced back pretty well. They both also outperformed Oil today. So, very possible.

JustinPulitzer	694259202072690692	2016-02-01T20:41:07	Some chasing going on here! Keep an eye on VIX. Bulls need a sub $20 close… back over $20 is subject to liquidation breaks still IMHO.
