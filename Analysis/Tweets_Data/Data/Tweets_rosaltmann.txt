rosaltmann	681951329250590720	2015-12-29T21:34:01	HilaryWyles Ministers can't just come in&amp;demand billions of taxpayers' money be spent on past campaigns! Working on many policy areas atm
rosaltmann	681949800087089153	2015-12-29T21:27:57	As Pensions Minister I can make better policy for ppl in future. Currently trying to help low paid avoid paying &gt;20% more for their pension
rosaltmann	681948485894205441	2015-12-29T21:22:43	doan1935 As you all know, I did that in 2011, informed and explained. But Parliamentary majority decides on spending taxpayer funds

rosaltmann	681947193918504960	2015-12-29T21:17:35	Ripoff_pensions I can steer policy forward but can't spend huge sums of taxpayers' money. Can steer future policy and help ppl understand
rosaltmann	681945758329880579	2015-12-29T21:11:53	pagechord Not being rude at all, it's an important question! Ministers have little power, try to make better policy in future
rosaltmann	681938398697906176	2015-12-29T20:42:38	Pensions Minister does not set levels and ages. Pensions Minister has no billions to give. It's taxpayers money decided by Parliament
rosaltmann	681937909738528768	2015-12-29T20:40:42	Calling State Pension a social security benefit from National Insurance isnt an insult it's our system. Gov decides qualifying age and level
