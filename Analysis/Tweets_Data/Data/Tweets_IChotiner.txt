IChotiner	725770772304646146	2016-04-28T19:36:50	lmlauramarsh anyway, the book is indeed excellent

IChotiner	725769863369646080	2016-04-28T19:33:14	lmlauramarsh or rather all the non Soviet factions
IChotiner	725769721354719232	2016-04-28T19:32:40	lmlauramarsh is he saying the Soviets were ancestors to all those who care about social justice?

IChotiner	725747915013017600	2016-04-28T18:06:01	sullivanamy this shit will be even more widespread, I sense, because a bunch of morons in Trump's world think it is politically effective
