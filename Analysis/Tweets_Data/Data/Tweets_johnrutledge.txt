johnrutledge	694648580313739264	2016-02-02T22:28:22	Earth: diameter 8000 mi.; crust (part you stand on) 4-15 mi thick. All the rest is that stuff coming out of volcano 
johnrutledge	694618227029123073	2016-02-02T20:27:45	Shouldn’t that be ‘thumbs down’?

johnrutledge	694602830238191616	2016-02-02T19:26:34	Agree. To a 1st approx. all sovereign wealth funds are oil sellers. Budget problems there forcing selling. 
johnrutledge	694602283686895616	2016-02-02T19:24:24	Good point, Rick. Almost every company I know missing sales s,  labor turnover problems from tight labor mkt 
johnrutledge	694581789822562305	2016-02-02T18:02:58	Good, I was getting worried! 
johnrutledge	694581319708184576	2016-02-02T18:01:05	Numbers could have been worse but market reaction to both revenue misses and management prose has been brutal 
johnrutledge	694578811040468992	2016-02-02T17:51:07	When stock prices get to zero will it be safe to call a market bottom? Or do we have to wait for negative numbers like the bond yields?
johnrutledge	694578444282175488	2016-02-02T17:49:40	5 year old daughter Jordy excited about class field trip to science museum today because “I’ve never been there before in my WHOLE LIFE.

johnrutledge	694576017604644864	2016-02-02T17:40:01	Definitely more rate cuts, maybe even here.  
johnrutledge	694574028082679808	2016-02-02T17:32:07	This will continue as a result of both internal (China, Brazil) and external (Fed, PBOC, oil price) reasons.

johnrutledge	694241909934395392	2016-02-01T19:32:24	Probably the counterfeiters out of Pyongyang returning

johnrutledge	694238235568943104	2016-02-01T19:17:48	This is the story western media are missing. Backsliding of democratic reforms in China are driving capital flight. 
johnrutledge	694054421504757761	2016-02-01T07:07:23	Every capital good embodies the set of relative prices in place when it was built. Sharp changes in prices =&gt; you built the wrong stuff.
johnrutledge	694052209483341824	2016-02-01T06:58:36	Actually he’s in Vancouver buying a condo—all cash deal. 
johnrutledge	694051615486013440	2016-02-01T06:56:14	He’s in the basement running the printing press. 
johnrutledge	694048314992361472	2016-02-01T06:43:07	He shoulda watched where he was going. 
johnrutledge	694047133884747776	2016-02-01T06:38:26	It’s not high/low oil prices that are good for a country, it’s stable prices. Radical price change obsoletes part of the capital stock
johnrutledge	694045933458161664	2016-02-01T06:33:39	AMZN est un des plus dominant affaires du monde. Si la prix tombe, comme la semaine passe, achête plus des actions 
johnrutledge	694044516077084673	2016-02-01T06:28:02	und wir tun überhaupt nichts darüber. 
johnrutledge	694043822494318592	2016-02-01T06:25:16	Stock market bubbles and ponzi schemes go together like chips and dip. Ezubao bilked 900K Chinese investors of $59B. 
johnrutledge	694001278804819968	2016-02-01T03:36:13	and only eat unleavened bread? 
johnrutledge	694000235287154689	2016-02-01T03:32:04	$300,000 each? I must say that even I could negotiate a better deal than that. 
johnrutledge	693993164235939840	2016-02-01T03:03:58	Good one. I would love to hear some theme song ideas from other friends too :) 
johnrutledge	693992089760083968	2016-02-01T02:59:42	She should play the theme from “Eraser" 
johnrutledge	693977619658739712	2016-02-01T02:02:12	This is brilliant, Carol! 
johnrutledge	693974202282438660	2016-02-01T01:48:37	It is Chinese investors moving capital offshore, not the hedge funds who are taking on PBOC to drive RMB lower.   
johnrutledge	693969767468634112	2016-02-01T01:31:00	That’s why I love the smell of a financial crisis in the morning 
johnrutledge	693965299607928839	2016-02-01T01:13:15	I like to go to interesting places that get the adrenaline going :) But then you are in an interesting place too! 
johnrutledge	693964112938700800	2016-02-01T01:08:32	If they want to see hell, Natalie, they should walk a ways North. Single most depressing place I have ever been, 
johnrutledge	693959756336136192	2016-02-01T00:51:13	Will be interesting, Jim, because you know every candidate on the stage is packing heat 
johnrutledge	693959348700073984	2016-02-01T00:49:36	Pat Paulsen (old guy joke) 
johnrutledge	693958622909374464	2016-02-01T00:46:43	I will stand ready for those emergency hotline calls! John 
johnrutledge	693956123758501888	2016-02-01T00:36:47	The death of China’s economy has been greatly exaggerated. The death of China’s capital markets has not. 
johnrutledge	693955842769424384	2016-02-01T00:35:40	Smells a little like 1998 
johnrutledge	693954516853530624	2016-02-01T00:30:24	Obrigado, Marcelo. 
johnrutledge	693953986928324608	2016-02-01T00:28:18	It will give her more money to use to fight for the little guy, right? LQTM 
johnrutledge	693953433187930112	2016-02-01T00:26:06	Actually, the entrepreneur is the one, out of the many who jumped, that got the plane built before hitting ground.

johnrutledge	693497723039789056	2016-01-30T18:15:16	Glad to. Thoughtful piece on Japan negative interest rates why not good when central banks take us exporing. 
johnrutledge	693340540167802880	2016-01-30T07:50:41	exactly right 
johnrutledge	692963560671047680	2016-01-29T06:52:42	Harder to get rid of than Argentine loans 
johnrutledge	692959920350715905	2016-01-29T06:38:14	Hoffentlich höher Preise 
johnrutledge	692957612632055808	2016-01-29T06:29:04	Totally agree, Worth. 
johnrutledge	692955406784696320	2016-01-29T06:20:18	and I’m sure that Obama will give a speech about it tomorrow... 
johnrutledge	692954847910445057	2016-01-29T06:18:04	Bien pour Nikkei, pas pour yen (maintenant 120.85). DXJ 
johnrutledge	692954227107315712	2016-01-29T06:15:36	Shrewd governments keep the educated kids after their education, rather than take the training home with them 
johnrutledge	692953798080380928	2016-01-29T06:13:54	PBOC will throw everything they have to stop falling market. Will push RMB still lower, accelerate capital outflow 
johnrutledge	692953329643683840	2016-01-29T06:12:02	They had to resort to more printing. Yen trashed. Can capture some of it with DXJ, conf Nikkei, short yen. 
johnrutledge	692891449541545984	2016-01-29T02:06:09	Whoops 
johnrutledge	692647173691969536	2016-01-28T09:55:29	Shocking news! 
johnrutledge	692643059725647872	2016-01-28T09:39:08	Safe is a big word johnrutledge 
johnrutledge	692639474719854592	2016-01-28T09:24:54	also Airbus deal. We are now seeing why US/EU were do eager to get the Iran deal signed. Bad trade.

johnrutledge	692616030795878400	2016-01-28T07:51:44	Schade, aber leine Überraschung.

johnrutledge	692541954417106944	2016-01-28T02:57:23	Asking politician to run an anticorruption campaign like asking a schizophrenic to take off his own straight jacket. 
johnrutledge	692541492129329152	2016-01-28T02:55:33	Perfect. Or Mala for tapas. Or hula grill in Kaanapali for a great burger and Hawaiian music.

johnrutledge	692529844601671681	2016-01-28T02:09:16	This Chinese government steadily backsliding into more and more central control. Sad to see after so much progress 
johnrutledge	692527977737928705	2016-01-28T02:01:51	gee, that’s too bad :( 
johnrutledge	692527297119780867	2016-01-28T01:59:08	It won’t last 
johnrutledge	692432503093727232	2016-01-27T19:42:28	The self-indulgence revealed in Fed comments is all driven by the assumptions in the misguided macro model that all Fed members salute to.
johnrutledge	692431614748577792	2016-01-27T19:38:56	Hi Jon. This isn't transparency; it's a soap opera where we get to share every emotional angst of every FOMC member 
johnrutledge	692427427952353281	2016-01-27T19:22:18	And thank you for the information. Too many people sit in their chair waiting for a govt statistic. Yours is direct. 
johnrutledge	692426893790941185	2016-01-27T19:20:10	If the Fed would cease all Open Mouth Operations and the Fed governors would keep their mouths closed we would be a lot better off.
johnrutledge	692424371709820929	2016-01-27T19:10:09	Shocking :) Raising them would have been evidence of death wish. "Federal Reserve holds interest rates at 0.5 percent"
johnrutledge	692423888546959360	2016-01-27T19:08:14	Wow! 
johnrutledge	692421540017639424	2016-01-27T18:58:54	Thanks for the update. Huge inflows into Vancouver RE now. 
johnrutledge	692416376380735488	2016-01-27T18:38:23	Clever. Chinese person who buys property and loans Canadian govt $800K interest-free for 5 years gets passport 
johnrutledge	692412010512945152	2016-01-27T18:21:02	No kidding. Any city in US/Canada (NY/BOS/CHI/SFO/LA/Vancouver/Toronto) w/ nonstop  China flight has lux RE boom 
johnrutledge	692411207593107456	2016-01-27T18:17:50	Good question. It's the reason the US Treasury put new rules in place last week for all cash purchases in New York. 
johnrutledge	692386072345624576	2016-01-27T16:37:58	Important story. But there's no "it" that is changing strategy. It is happening as companies cling up margin chain 
johnrutledge	692382223341854720	2016-01-27T16:22:40	This is the problem. The real story is not foreign investors. It is CHINESE investors moving capital out of china 
johnrutledge	692172698248728576	2016-01-27T02:30:05	Difference is amount Chinese importers overstate value of imports to get capital out of the country.

johnrutledge	691880531710103552	2016-01-26T07:09:07	Japan, HK down 2-3%, China down 6-7% this morning. China capital flight pushing RMB lower. Here we go again. :(
johnrutledge	691770762152316928	2016-01-25T23:52:56	Small firms less exposed to global problems, less exposed to oil prices, now able to get working capital

johnrutledge	691443193498341376	2016-01-25T02:11:18	MB joining race would raise average quality of candidates in both parties. Actually, ANYONE joining race would do so
