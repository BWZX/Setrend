DavidBeckworth	726044252279607296	2016-04-29T13:43:33	D_Blanchflower That's why level targeting is needed...anchor long-run inflation, but allow temporary deviations above 2%.

DavidBeckworth	719523116310011904	2016-04-11T13:50:53	economeer ...all suggest the cyclical story is more important since 2008. Risk premiums need were too low pre-crisis, now too high.
DavidBeckworth	719522703972175872	2016-04-11T13:49:15	economeer dearth of investment easier story to tell pre-2008. Since then (1) safe asset destroyed in crisis &amp; (2) spate of bad macro news..

DavidBeckworth	719519342619189249	2016-04-11T13:35:53	economeer This latter part is behind accelerated decline in yields since 2008. Here is my earliest post on it

DavidBeckworth	714949201478615040	2016-03-29T22:55:47	amillerstrategy boes_ It's hard for Fed not to be confusing, given its often ad-hoc approach to monetary policy.

DavidBeckworth	714944704492789761	2016-03-29T22:37:55	boes_ To be clear, by previous tightening mistake I mean the talking up of rate hikes from mid-2014 to Dec 2015 while other CBs eased.

DavidBeckworth	703193065264025601	2016-02-26T12:21:06	ericlonners You may be right.
DavidBeckworth	703192715626811392	2016-02-26T12:19:42	ericlonners I read somewhwere, good test is to l look at marginal cost of oil production versus price to get a sense of demand vs. supply.

DavidBeckworth	703192407009939456	2016-02-26T12:18:29	ericlonners Sure, no denying that. Hamilton &amp; Bernanke saying only up to about half of decline since mid-2014 demand driven.
DavidBeckworth	703191178749964288	2016-02-26T12:13:36	ericlonners Thanks. I suspect authoritarian leaders will first try capital controls, but eventually  it's going to blow up. Big devaluation
DavidBeckworth	703190970255306752	2016-02-26T12:12:46	ericlonners But they also should be affected by global demand too, right?

DavidBeckworth	703187269658619904	2016-02-26T11:58:04	But what if part of oil decline--which is pulling down inf exp--is due to weak global demand?

DavidBeckworth	684951059031130112	2016-01-07T04:13:52	TimDuy And the Fed still continues to show no willingness to make 2% anything other than an inflation ceiling.
DavidBeckworth	684949674604662784	2016-01-07T04:08:22	So Chinese stock market plunges and PBoC tightens monetary policy...what could possibly go wrong?  
DavidBeckworth	684901677107826689	2016-01-07T00:57:39	EconomicsOne greg_ip Any chance you will do a blog post on the AEA panel? I would've loved to been there.
DavidBeckworth	684901073614540800	2016-01-07T00:55:15	The implications still apply. If the Fed allows IOER to get ahead of equilibrium or 'natural rate' then BOOM interfluidity NYTimeskrugman
DavidBeckworth	684900700984246273	2016-01-07T00:53:46	The GeorgeSelgin post on IOER reminded me of this post based on exchange with interfluidity &amp; NYTimeskrugman. ...
DavidBeckworth	684851418814111744	2016-01-06T21:37:56	swinshi Okay, I checked with Brian Strow and he has you here  on February 17th. Does this sound familiar?
DavidBeckworth	684815395283406848	2016-01-06T19:14:48	Once again THE STORY from the FOMC minutes is these charts, which show a lot more confidence than they did in Sept. 
DavidBeckworth	684793249253298176	2016-01-06T17:46:48	JoshZumbrun greg_ip But if you add inflation forecast to LW real i* estimate you get numbers not to far off from ffr dots two years out.
DavidBeckworth	684792659605495808	2016-01-06T17:44:27	JoshZumbrun greg_ip Sorry, I meant to say I would NOT depend solely on it!
DavidBeckworth	684792496153493504	2016-01-06T17:43:48	JoshZumbrun greg_ip I depend solely on it, but it does provide one estimate of the med-term i*. So add inflation forecast to it...
DavidBeckworth	684791031443795969	2016-01-06T17:37:59	JoshZumbrun greg_ip This means LW not a real-time guide for ffr, that is what the Taylor Rule or a short-term i* estimate provides.
DavidBeckworth	684790419440312320	2016-01-06T17:35:33	JoshZumbrun greg_ip Excerpt from original 2003 LW paper. Note they say estimate is like Taylor Rule intercept... 
DavidBeckworth	684789941688074240	2016-01-06T17:33:39	JoshZumbrun greg_ip Sure, &amp; it depends on what horizon for the ffr you filling out dots. LW at best a medium term guide...
DavidBeckworth	684786727261634560	2016-01-06T17:20:53	JoshZumbrun greg_ip These are conditional estimates, base on what people knew at the time.
DavidBeckworth	684786570583347200	2016-01-06T17:20:15	JoshZumbrun greg_ip It is no different than looking at say inflation forecast in 2007 that foresaw higher inflation...
DavidBeckworth	684785862119313408	2016-01-06T17:17:26	JoshZumbrun greg_ip BTW, I say 2-5 years since "medium term" is not well defined.
DavidBeckworth	684785661027590144	2016-01-06T17:16:38	JoshZumbrun greg_ip It means that at that point in time, short-term i* was expected to average about 2% over next 2-5 years.
DavidBeckworth	684784719347621888	2016-01-06T17:12:54	JoshZumbrun greg_ip WL estiamate is medium term i*. So it is not current value, but  average value of short-term i* over 2-5 years out.
DavidBeckworth	684783649942716417	2016-01-06T17:08:39	JoshZumbrun greg_ip Not sure I understand your 2nd question.
DavidBeckworth	684783562902523904	2016-01-06T17:08:18	JoshZumbrun greg_ip Answer to 1st question one is that Fed should ideally have had its target rate aligned with the neutral rate in 2007.
DavidBeckworth	684781609493467136	2016-01-06T17:00:32	JoshZumbrun greg_ip IMHO, it is travesty that the Fed doesn't release this data regularly. Have an OpEd coming out soon on this point.
DavidBeckworth	684781380115415041	2016-01-06T16:59:38	JoshZumbrun greg_ip Janet Yellen also revealed Board's range of estimates for short-term i* in Dec speech. 
DavidBeckworth	684780926547591172	2016-01-06T16:57:50	JoshZumbrun greg_ip Curdia data file is . He plans to keep it updated.
DavidBeckworth	684780748289642496	2016-01-06T16:57:07	JoshZumbrun greg_ip Laubach-Williams estimate is a medium-term i*. For a short-term i* see SF Fed's Vasco Curdia 
DavidBeckworth	684780385465569280	2016-01-06T16:55:41	swinshi Maybe I am wrong, but I thought you were invited by Brian Strow to give lecture here. Let me double check.

DavidBeckworth	683786631694831616	2016-01-03T23:06:51	BlakeLavak MariaBartiromo You need to follow up on davidmwessel advice and read up on what is the equilibrium or 'natural' interest rate.
DavidBeckworth	683785964427214849	2016-01-03T23:04:12	davidmwessel This is an incredibly important point that so many miss. Frustrating to watch.
