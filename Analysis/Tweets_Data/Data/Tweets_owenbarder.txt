owenbarder	719451666945286144	2016-04-11T09:06:58	@HugoSmart1 I don't see any reference in 70B to it applying only to rights that have been exercised.
owenbarder	719451243337420801	2016-04-11T09:05:17	HugoSmart1 So why does 70 B apply to Greeks living in the UK but not Greeks living in Greece?

owenbarder	703211521967570944	2016-02-26T13:34:26	Todaysopinionis The point being made is that we do these things better (including more cheaply) in the EU, not whether we do them at all.

owenbarder	703145060884320258	2016-02-26T09:10:20	mattrichmnd Right. There is an increase in efforts to quantify impact from a very low base. Again, not clear it is excessive.
owenbarder	703142842546278401	2016-02-26T09:01:32	mattrichmnd The fact that grantees complain about rigorous impact evaluation doesn't necessarily mean it is excessive?
