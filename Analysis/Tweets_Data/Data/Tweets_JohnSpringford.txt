JohnSpringford	723236635291324416	2016-04-21T19:47:05	Bootle - EU is the thing that's holding Europe back - so break up would be a good thing - or fundamental reform of it

JohnSpringford	723236046398459904	2016-04-21T19:44:45	.martinwolf_ - we would have to go for WTO, pull article 50, and that's it.

JohnSpringford	723235057792618498	2016-04-21T19:40:49	.DrGerardLyons - banks say they have to go where the markets are. That means London.
JohnSpringford	723234817270267904	2016-04-21T19:39:52	.DrGerardLyons - considerable uncertainty about the future of the EU. City could be penalised if we stay - eurozone dominating fin reg
JohnSpringford	723234244936499201	2016-04-21T19:37:35	.MyStephanomics - if eurozone dominates and damages our interests, we can leave.
JohnSpringford	723233947916718080	2016-04-21T19:36:24	.MyStephanomics those things will be less likely to happen if we leave - the Euro crisis has made that hard enough.

JohnSpringford	723230799055728640	2016-04-21T19:23:54	.DrGerardLyons - points to report for Boris Johnson - independent forecast showed long-run, reformed EU best. Then WTO. Then unreformed EU

JohnSpringford	723229898966491136	2016-04-21T19:20:19	Bootle - politics will drive economic policy. So impossible to know what the costs and benefits post-Brexit are.
JohnSpringford	723229221573787648	2016-04-21T19:17:38	.martinwolf_ zero chance of unilateral free trade. So will WTO and FTAs be better? No - need services and hence the EU's clout.
JohnSpringford	723228916329095168	2016-04-21T19:16:25	.martinwolf_ EEA is a nonsense. Swiss won't work. So two alternatives. WTO, tariffs, then try to get FTAs. Or unilateral free trade.
JohnSpringford	723228395149090817	2016-04-21T19:14:20	.EvanHD asks - if WTO then we have to have low tariffs for everyone, no leverage? DrGerardLyons - trade deals are not the only thing.
JohnSpringford	723227764141228032	2016-04-21T19:11:50	Bootle- Norway model no good - most regs, budget contribs. Switz not on cards. Should argue on basis of WTO. intellectually honest.
JohnSpringford	723227193220972544	2016-04-21T19:09:34	Questions start. What might happen to the EU if we leave? You create a blueprint for exit. And so Grexit becomes more likely.
JohnSpringford	723226517921247232	2016-04-21T19:06:53	DrGerardLyons - the EU isn't open enough. And London can be open and it has large advantages that have nothing to do with EU
JohnSpringford	723226187242332160	2016-04-21T19:05:34	.EvanHD - asks DrGerardLyons - what about banking passports - non-EU banks in London serving EU?
JohnSpringford	723225689932083200	2016-04-21T19:03:36	.DrGerardLyons - there will be a near-term shock. But it won't necessarily be large - people thought leaving ERM would be bad CERBrexit
JohnSpringford	723225135235383296	2016-04-21T19:01:23	.DrGerardLyons - services single market not very advanced. 75% EU economy is services, only 25% trade. So services would not suffer much.
JohnSpringford	723224738890440704	2016-04-21T18:59:49	.DrGerardLyons the single market is the status quo market - it doesn't help new, young firms. CERBrexit
JohnSpringford	723224572061966336	2016-04-21T18:59:09	.DrGerardLyons - EU's FTAs are much less comprehensive in terms of EU trade than other OECD countries.
JohnSpringford	723224277848342530	2016-04-21T18:57:59	.DrGerardLyons - EU has been centralising, while most dynamic economies have been flexible and decentralising
JohnSpringford	723223700682715136	2016-04-21T18:55:41	.DrGerardLyons - costs are not small - budget is about total contribution because we can spend it all as we like. CERBrexit
JohnSpringford	723223439717351428	2016-04-21T18:54:39	DrGerardLyons - ROW has overtaken EU trade. Immigration leads to pressure on public services. And we can't pick and choose
JohnSpringford	723223200050589696	2016-04-21T18:53:42	.martinwolf_ - option is always available - Brexit is forever, and Bremain leaves us options CERBrexit
JohnSpringford	723222757211820032	2016-04-21T18:51:56	.martinwolf_ - divorce is rarely with amicable. Have annoyed and insulted them. And we export more to them than they export to us.
JohnSpringford	723222357549158400	2016-04-21T18:50:21	.martinwolf_ - Tokyo round, Uruguay round wouldn't have happened without the EU.
JohnSpringford	723222083111624704	2016-04-21T18:49:16	.martinwolf_ - if euro implodes, it will damage us in or out. CERBrexit
JohnSpringford	723221915838623744	2016-04-21T18:48:36	.martinwolf_ - we can leave later if eurozone gangs up on us. CERBrexit
JohnSpringford	723221783202140161	2016-04-21T18:48:04	.martinwolf_ - regulation is a red herring. UK very lightly regulated. UK problems home grown - land use, for instance
JohnSpringford	723221561843539968	2016-04-21T18:47:11	.martinwolf_ - EU has created trade, not diverted it. Have a decent comp policy. Migration is a benefit, not a cost
JohnSpringford	723221373263421441	2016-04-21T18:46:26	.martinwolf_ I'm going to tell you why the Brexiteers are all wrong. CERBrexit
JohnSpringford	723221114332307456	2016-04-21T18:45:25	Bootle - exporters can carry on using EU standards. But a dry cleaner won't have to abide by the Working Time Directive. CERBrexit
JohnSpringford	723220731597848576	2016-04-21T18:43:53	Bootle - why does EU make bad decisions? Because its institutions are wrong. If they created the Euro heaven knows what they'll produce next
JohnSpringford	723220390085013504	2016-04-21T18:42:32	Bootle - escape from being in difficult position of being in the EU and not in the Euro.
JohnSpringford	723220162007187457	2016-04-21T18:41:38	Bootle - £10 bn budget would be worth having. Trade deals with ROW - hard to get agreements with the 28. So EU has been a bad negotiator
JohnSpringford	723219887494148097	2016-04-21T18:40:32	Bootle - if single market so great, while has growth been so bad? Euro swamps any gains.
JohnSpringford	723219727301136384	2016-04-21T18:39:54	Bootle - single market gains come from them being in it, not us - we can still trade with them. And non-EU exports to EU did better than UK
JohnSpringford	723219452448387073	2016-04-21T18:38:48	Bootle - is the EU reformable? Even under Cameron's deal the EU refused to reform. CERBrexit
JohnSpringford	723219241265184769	2016-04-21T18:37:58	Roger Bootle - expansion to the east turned migration two-way street into a one-way motorway CERBrexit
JohnSpringford	723218993851580417	2016-04-21T18:36:59	Roger Bootle - Cameron's deal delivered a mouse.
JohnSpringford	723218900515586048	2016-04-21T18:36:37	Roger Bootle - expansion to the east should not have come with deepening.
JohnSpringford	723218899957891072	2016-04-21T18:36:37	Roger Bootle - only recently become a sceptic about the EU -always was about the Euro CERBrexit

JohnSpringford	704675215226368000	2016-03-01T14:30:38	11 And UK would have to abide by EU regs (and budget contributions, free movement) to have anywhere near its current level of market access.
JohnSpringford	704675126852370433	2016-03-01T14:30:17	10 EU regulations do not stop the OECD from ranking the UK’s markets as lightly regulated.
JohnSpringford	704675057373675520	2016-03-01T14:30:00	9 Perhaps most important, the uncertainty about trade barriers during the Brexit negotiations would diminish foreign investment.
JohnSpringford	704674970341908480	2016-03-01T14:29:39	8 Politicians would have to respond to a Brexit vote – reduce immigration. This would lower long-run GDP (less so GDP per capita).
JohnSpringford	704674908022898688	2016-03-01T14:29:24	7 The City of London is particularly endangered by non-tariff barriers. Eurozone wants to supervise its own wholesale finance, eg.
JohnSpringford	704674843338342400	2016-03-01T14:29:09	6 These FTAs take a long time to negotiate. The US or Japan would care less about an FTA with UK than EU, because it is 1/6 the size.
JohnSpringford	704674777223598080	2016-03-01T14:28:53	5 It follows that FTAs with other countries will have to be more comprehensive to make up for trade barriers that arise across the Channel.
JohnSpringford	704674699192705024	2016-03-01T14:28:35	4 The single market is one of the most comprehensive FTAs in the world (perhaps Australia-NZ beats it).
JohnSpringford	704674632247410689	2016-03-01T14:28:19	3 Higher trade barriers with the EU are thus especially costly.
JohnSpringford	704674550961860608	2016-03-01T14:27:59	2 We are tied to the EU by geography: 45% of our exports go to the EU because it is a big, nearby economy.

JohnSpringford	702912024611823616	2016-02-25T17:44:20	andrew_lilico DuncanWeldon also lower immigration, which is a long-term story
JohnSpringford	702911766033002496	2016-02-25T17:43:19	andrew_lilico DuncanWeldon I think it's also long-term. GDP forgone, if you assume NTBs accumulate over time, UK leaves single market
JohnSpringford	702910251906043904	2016-02-25T17:37:18	andrew_lilico Found this tricky, because my guess is smaller eurozone with closer integration after periphery leaves during next recession

JohnSpringford	702508636770275328	2016-02-24T15:01:25	James_Barr answer : probably. But the ECB and the clearing houses would prefer that answer to be a certain yes, meaning relocate to EZ
JohnSpringford	702508454645256193	2016-02-24T15:00:42	James_Barr The big question is liquidity provision, I believe. Wld ECB provide emergency liquidity in crisis to infra it doesn't supervise

JohnSpringford	693100790068682754	2016-01-29T15:58:00	8 So the vast majority of EU migrants are in households who earn more than that. Very small number would be cut off
JohnSpringford	693100758217146368	2016-01-29T15:57:52	7 If they didn’t earn 7k, they’d be inelgible for benefits. But most UK in-work benefits for families with children
JohnSpringford	693100725296087040	2016-01-29T15:57:44	6 Germany suggested making a ‘worker’ in EU law mean someone who earned above a threshold – say 7k
JohnSpringford	693100692878286850	2016-01-29T15:57:37	5 So it will be difficult for Cameron to convince the rEU that the brake should be easily pulled
