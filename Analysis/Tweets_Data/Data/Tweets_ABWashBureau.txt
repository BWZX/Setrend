ABWashBureau	715209058186342401	2016-03-30T16:08:22	I say theoretically cause it's never been tested and the Fed has never laid down rules. But still, SIFI does not = TBTF.
ABWashBureau	715208860085170177	2016-03-30T16:07:34	But a SIFI designation is designed to stop that from happening. Theoretically, the firm fails, management fired, pieces sold off.
ABWashBureau	715208692975722496	2016-03-30T16:06:54	That's not "too big to fail." In TBTF, the firm survives intact after a bailout from the government. You know, like Citi.
ABWashBureau	715208533533437952	2016-03-30T16:06:16	A SIFI designation, in fact, theoretically brands a nonbank as an entity the government can and would seize in the event of a crisis.
ABWashBureau	715208348849803264	2016-03-30T16:05:32	Folks, a SIFI designation isn't the same thing as saying a firm is "too big to fail." Don't use it interchangeably.

ABWashBureau	695321427889754112	2016-02-04T19:02:01	robkroese Yes. Ewwwww.

ABWashBureau	695320148308287488	2016-02-04T18:56:56	jenhowell77 Some of his banking ideas would do the opposite of what he wants. Cap lending rates = WAY less lending. Poor hurt most.

ABWashBureau	695319946558062592	2016-02-04T18:56:08	jenhowell77 Honestly, I think you would be incredibly disappointed by a Sanders presidency.
ABWashBureau	695319796360073216	2016-02-04T18:55:32	jenhowell77 Sure, but Va has only been blue the last two pres elections cause of African-American turnout. Sanders is weak there.

ABWashBureau	695316716398735365	2016-02-04T18:43:18	jenhowell77 I admire your idealism, but I do not see the same Sanders you do. Perhaps I'm too jaded. Either way, he won't win.
ABWashBureau	695316449804566528	2016-02-04T18:42:14	jenhowell77 Come on, my butter joke was funny.
ABWashBureau	695315884143935488	2016-02-04T18:39:59	jenhowell77 You and I apparently view the density of butter very differently.
ABWashBureau	695315776958545920	2016-02-04T18:39:34	jenhowell77 I think Cruz believes he will win and I don't think Cruz is an idiot. But I also don't think he can win (against Clinton.)
ABWashBureau	695315604409024513	2016-02-04T18:38:53	jenhowell77 It was hyperbole. I agree. But so is saying this election is "last chance." It's not.
ABWashBureau	695315307930521600	2016-02-04T18:37:42	jenhowell77 I didn't say he was an idiot. I don't think he is.
ABWashBureau	695315230310686720	2016-02-04T18:37:23	jenhowell77 Also, Sanders telling you things that can't happen. He can't break up the banks, no matter what he promises.
ABWashBureau	695315026937319426	2016-02-04T18:36:35	jenhowell77 Sanders is definitely extreme. Except on guns. On guns, he's a Republican.
ABWashBureau	695314913917558784	2016-02-04T18:36:08	jenhowell77 But I'd legitimately like to see that poll.
ABWashBureau	695314728424443904	2016-02-04T18:35:24	jenhowell77 I live in Va. Have all my life. I know my state.
ABWashBureau	695314597272752129	2016-02-04T18:34:52	jenhowell77 World polling doesn't count!
ABWashBureau	695314249690800128	2016-02-04T18:33:30	jenhowell77 Ohio is also true. If Rubio gets Fl, OH and Va, he wins.
ABWashBureau	695314120464273409	2016-02-04T18:32:59	jenhowell77 The point is: Va is way too conservative to go for Sanders. It could go for a moderate like Clinton, but not lefty.
ABWashBureau	695313981653794818	2016-02-04T18:32:26	jenhowell77 Clinton will paint Rubio as an extreme candidate. But Sanders is also an extreme candidate.
ABWashBureau	695313733787197440	2016-02-04T18:31:27	jenhowell77 Bush, Cruz tried that and didn't get anywhere. Guy is young, charismatic, not too far right.
ABWashBureau	695313487296339969	2016-02-04T18:30:28	jenhowell77 So it comes down to Virginia and Ohio. Both are swing states, Va only recently.
ABWashBureau	695313357520371712	2016-02-04T18:29:57	jenhowell77 Doesn't matter. We can agree Rubio gets Florida, right? He's from there, after all.
ABWashBureau	695313117962706944	2016-02-04T18:29:00	jenhowell77 Frankly, I'm not sure Clinton can beat Rubio either, but it's a fight for sure.
ABWashBureau	695313020688457728	2016-02-04T18:28:37	jenhowell77 Rubio takes Florida, Ohio and Virginia. That's all he needs to take beyond red states. He wins. Game over.
ABWashBureau	695312463450001410	2016-02-04T18:26:24	I enjoy the implicit suggestion that I'm not cynical enough.
ABWashBureau	695312079528542208	2016-02-04T18:24:52	jenhowell77 I can look at the electoral college and see how things are going to go. Rubio would beat Sanders easily. (Cruz too prob)
ABWashBureau	695311626828922880	2016-02-04T18:23:04	jenhowell77 No, I'm definitely not making your case. Sanders can't win. That's what I'm saying.
ABWashBureau	695311337099038721	2016-02-04T18:21:55	jenhowell77 I follow politics for a living and I'm older than you. Not sure what that proves, but there you are.
ABWashBureau	695311164394336259	2016-02-04T18:21:14	jenhowell77 Referring to Sanders' chances in a general election. He can't get elected. Can't. Won't happen.
ABWashBureau	695311012631855104	2016-02-04T18:20:38	jenhowell77 Same argument was made about Gore. Look how that ended.

ABWashBureau	695310684255621120	2016-02-04T18:19:20	jenhowell77 I think you are seeing what you want to see, not what is.
ABWashBureau	695310392453627904	2016-02-04T18:18:10	jenhowell77 Remember when people said Bush vs. Gore didn't matter? Do you honestly believe that?
ABWashBureau	695310162920341505	2016-02-04T18:17:15	jenhowell77 VT is not the nation. Not even close.
ABWashBureau	695310082557546496	2016-02-04T18:16:56	jenhowell77 And you think it would be better if Cruz or Rubio were in charge? Cause if Sanders wins the Dem nominee, that's what happens.
ABWashBureau	695309906061193216	2016-02-04T18:16:14	jenhowell77 Also, the Dems would lose seats in the House and Senate if Sanders was the nominee.
ABWashBureau	695309739425685504	2016-02-04T18:15:34	jenhowell77 Counter-argument: If you nominate Sanders, you will hand the GOP the next 3-4 Supreme Court nominations.
ABWashBureau	695309476593799168	2016-02-04T18:14:32	jenhowell77 This is hyperbole on a grand scale. You know that, right? Clinton is hardly The Devil. Neither is any other candidate.

ABWashBureau	684454815972388865	2016-01-05T19:21:59	Sanders: "In my view, Sen. Warren is right. Dodd-Frank should have broken up Citigroup and other TBTF banks into pieces."
ABWashBureau	684454719578894336	2016-01-05T19:21:36	Sanders cites Elizabeth Warren for her bill to restore Glass-Steagall.

ABWashBureau	684454435930648576	2016-01-05T19:20:28	Sanders would have his Tres Scy draw up a list of TBTF banks and shadow banks. Then he would take them apart within a year.
ABWashBureau	684454285061537792	2016-01-05T19:19:52	Sanders: If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, he would say 'break them up.' He would be right.

ABWashBureau	684453786765627392	2016-01-05T19:17:53	Sanders cites JPM, Wells and BofA as bigger following the crisis because "they are too big to fail."

ABWashBureau	684449131759316996	2016-01-05T18:59:24	But if a bank truly is "too big to fail," you wouldn't be able to dismantle them in a year. If you could, they wouldn't be TBTF.
ABWashBureau	684449038020784129	2016-01-05T18:59:01	Seriously, Sanders wants the Tres Secy to identify all "too big to fail" banks -- and then dismantle them in a year.
