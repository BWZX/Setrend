Wexboy_Value	723506558202744832	2016-04-22T13:39:40	Tht being said, I confess sm retailers are a rare temptation for me nw...a few high quality/growth (or lowest cost) retailers seem on sale
Wexboy_Value	723505798693920768	2016-04-22T13:36:39	Particularly in the US, where you can package any old tat in a REIT &amp; income investors will generally buy it any price/multiple...
Wexboy_Value	723505613871964160	2016-04-22T13:35:55	Greater shareholder value cn be delivered by selling/spinning off property...and returning capital, and/or using it to accelerate biz growth
Wexboy_Value	723504937976631296	2016-04-22T13:33:13	Then there's the valuation issue: Property owned by a retailer is often misunderstood &amp; under-valued by investors...
Wexboy_Value	723504098226655236	2016-04-22T13:29:53	i.e. You end up w/ a retailing biz which can't stand on its own two feet &amp; mk a decent return if it was charged rent...let alone a mkt rent!
Wexboy_Value	723503612127752193	2016-04-22T13:27:57	Retailers owning property may seem lk a fine idea, bt historically it's almst inevitably turned out to be an excuse for a poor retailing biz
Wexboy_Value	723503162838138880	2016-04-22T13:26:10	Have they justified this buy vs. lease strategy to their shareholders, and/or do they really present a better/worse investment proposition?
Wexboy_Value	723502710063026176	2016-04-22T13:24:22	But what abt comparability to retailers who buy their property? Well, why make them comparable, they really are a different beast...
Wexboy_Value	723502331887771648	2016-04-22T13:22:52	Capitalising prob wn't help risk equation: If you own a retailer &amp; start worrying abt its lease liability...it/you alrdy hv bigger problems!
Wexboy_Value	723500295385419776	2016-04-22T13:14:47	So it's one extreme, or another...growing retailers at ridiculous multiples, or a dirt cheap price but the retailer's prob going terminal
Wexboy_Value	723499083097333762	2016-04-22T13:09:58	Frm my perspective, when it comes to growing retailers, investors generally under-estimate the risks of a relatively fixed cost structure
Wexboy_Value	723498557211336704	2016-04-22T13:07:52	Of course, everybody else is doing the same...
Wexboy_Value	723498077848494080	2016-04-22T13:05:58	In reality, each sector/business can offer v different mix of fixed &amp; variable costs/risks, and investors hv to evaluate &amp; price accordingly
Wexboy_Value	723497437944532992	2016-04-22T13:03:25	Retailers have a huge &amp; relatively fixed cost in their leases...but then again, a work-force is a pretty fixed cost too for most businesses
Wexboy_Value	723496473514643456	2016-04-22T12:59:35	Too right mate, and tht's why I rarely consider retailers for investment - they are special &amp; different...
Wexboy_Value	723496283017719808	2016-04-22T12:58:50	And every business has leases, why not capitalise all of them...ah but, retailers are different &amp; special, is the reply
Wexboy_Value	723495923825926145	2016-04-22T12:57:24	UKValueInvestor mks a grt point here:  If you capitalise leases, shdn't you also capitalise human capital (wages)?!
Wexboy_Value	723495382500646912	2016-04-22T12:55:15	I've never been inspired to capitalise leases, bt it's never fun to argue for/against either...
