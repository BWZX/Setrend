sarahkendzior	721069876467466241	2016-04-15T20:17:10	As industries collapse, moving to where the jobs are is a huge risk. As affordable  cities stagnate or decline, staying is a risk as well.
sarahkendzior	721069296294604800	2016-04-15T20:14:51	Nah, this is just me airing my views. Got a book covering it though  
sarahkendzior	721068908967387136	2016-04-15T20:13:19	The result is a narrow pool of coastal elites both describing and making policy for regions of the country about which they know nothing.
sarahkendzior	721068463662325761	2016-04-15T20:11:33	Decentralizating industries from most expensive cities would bring in talent from diverse applicant pool. But industries oppose this move.
sarahkendzior	721068007540166657	2016-04-15T20:09:44	As technology made telecommuting feasible, industries tightened residency requirements, limiting applicants to those who can afford expense.
sarahkendzior	721066851225055232	2016-04-15T20:05:08	Cities flush with jobs are unaffordable. Cities that are affordable lack jobs. Result: debt, immobility, fear.

sarahkendzior	719609701000880128	2016-04-11T19:34:57	MWallner_ Good piece. Wish more would focus on why parts of bill weren't repealed once crime had dropped. Everyone post '94 to blame too.
sarahkendzior	719604619832270853	2016-04-11T19:14:45	Yes. Wrote in 2013: "Managed expectations in the post-employment economy"

sarahkendzior	719603458660179972	2016-04-11T19:10:08	nataliereed84 Always worth checking. Trans activism is something many in US began to support only recently. Hope gets mainstream support.
sarahkendzior	719601567238737920	2016-04-11T19:02:37	dvh03 But our long term unemployment problem does not remotely mirror past conditions. Nor does the dispersion, pervasiveness of poverty.
sarahkendzior	719601128690716672	2016-04-11T19:00:53	LGBT activists in red states face not only more discrimination and threats but greater lack of resources. Any effort to give money is great.
sarahkendzior	719600402878980097	2016-04-11T18:58:00	This is a good strategy.

sarahkendzior	719598600745918464	2016-04-11T18:50:50	In the US, the long-term unemployed are literally and figuratively discounted. They're not counted in stats, and their suffering is ignored.
sarahkendzior	719598170209038336	2016-04-11T18:49:07	Or is it that they believe those who don't feel the recovery don't matter? Like how folks are counted out of existence in unemployment stats
sarahkendzior	719597603504041984	2016-04-11T18:46:52	Where are the people who claim an economic recovery living? From St Louis to NYC, I see homeless, starving people, suffering in plain sight.

sarahkendzior	719593486845026304	2016-04-11T18:30:31	Homelessness is a big problem in St Louis. County has no shelter. City shelter under attack. 
sarahkendzior	719589771358507008	2016-04-11T18:15:45	In St Louis, a city of empty houses, they've added bolts to grates so that homeless can't sleep on them to stay warm

sarahkendzior	719503771341033472	2016-04-11T12:34:01	Well so this thread is a great way to wake up: 
sarahkendzior	719513353131941888	2016-04-11T13:12:05	While you're looking at that low life expectancy map, here's a slice of life from one of the afflicted regions 
sarahkendzior	719512032324661249	2016-04-11T13:06:51	Absolutely. Secrecy and denial. In St Louis (Bridgeton) too. IMO environmental journalism is among hardest to do. 
sarahkendzior	719510109169299457	2016-04-11T12:59:12	palmd Agree. People studying the opiate epidemic in the US should use Russian alcohol, economic and health problems as comparison.
sarahkendzior	719509699624701952	2016-04-11T12:57:34	jondresner It's so weird that it's not mentioned. Its not THE factor, but definitely A factor, linked to ones they did list.
sarahkendzior	719509381159587840	2016-04-11T12:56:18	sarahkendzior Oh, yeah, we live in a medium red area on that map: old mining town (coal, zinc, *lead*) and petroleum industry, farming.
sarahkendzior	719509337106821121	2016-04-11T12:56:08	Environmental toxicity tied to poverty. Plenty of folks want to move but their work is in toxic factories, and their homes are hard to sell.
sarahkendzior	719508308105662464	2016-04-11T12:52:03	Compare this map with these environmental toxin site maps. Wonder why no mention as factor:  
sarahkendzior	719503297871093760	2016-04-11T12:32:08	Odd omission. Flint, air toxicity + water poisoning in KY and W. Indiana factory zones, Nevada nuclear test site... 
sarahkendzior	719496295459594240	2016-04-11T12:04:19	Not mentioned in article: air, water poisoning. Some of these red areas known for environmental toxins.

sarahkendzior	719222688170938372	2016-04-10T17:57:06	Yes. Media image of CT still very misleading. It ain't Stars Hollow. Visit the post-industrial center.

sarahkendzior	719206340103569409	2016-04-10T16:52:08	docrocktex26 joannelamotte Some more documentation on how bad it was, from where I grew up 
sarahkendzior	719205670533267458	2016-04-10T16:49:28	They only see the repercussions of the bill, which are horrendous and damaging. But need to know whole history. 
sarahkendzior	719205197734481920	2016-04-10T16:47:35	My childhood memories: Latin Kings, Diablos, hearing guy shot to death outside, lying to kid I babysat that it was "fireworks". Early 1990s.
sarahkendzior	719204785782546432	2016-04-10T16:45:57	I'm jealous of the people who don't understand why the crime bill was supported. A bad bill. But if it's an abstraction to you, you're lucky

sarahkendzior	719198998813249536	2016-04-10T16:22:58	ScottRGraber I agree with what you're saying. I wish it were different. Hard to convince people to invest in system that's  cruel to them.
sarahkendzior	719198696982728704	2016-04-10T16:21:46	docrocktex26 Not a myth and not a black issue only. I grew up in 80s/90s with Latin Kings and Diablos (white biker gang). Nonstop violence.
sarahkendzior	718969244260499456	2016-04-10T01:10:00	Reagan and Nixon sure do appreciate y'all blaming Clinton and the crime bill for racist drug laws they signed. So does today's GOP.
sarahkendzior	719196942744485888	2016-04-10T16:14:47	ScottRGraber I'm not sure what we're seeing is apathy as much as profound disillusionment and loss of faith in institutions and people.
sarahkendzior	719191871247921153	2016-04-10T15:54:38	ScottRGraber No. No one deserves to suffer. I wish they had voted for Bob. I'm also not surprised that people long screwed over don't vote.

sarahkendzior	706689280769282048	2016-03-07T03:53:48	And the crux of their anger is that they didn't believe she could be upset at sexism. As they dog-pile an eight-year-old girl and talk rape.
sarahkendzior	706688956146954240	2016-03-07T03:52:31	So in sum: I have had to lock my account because my daughter was upset at sexism, I tweeted about it, and a man brought up raping her.

sarahkendzior	701067472552591360	2016-02-20T15:34:45	With Ferguson he focused on youth unemployment, with brief mention of black Americans

sarahkendzior	700681098041257985	2016-02-19T13:59:26	aisforamber Hillary's record is also bad. But Bernie voted for the crime bill. Hillary had offensive rhetoric but did not make policy then.

sarahkendzior	700680232215273472	2016-02-19T13:56:00	aisforamber Then why does Vermont disproportionately incarcerate black people -- one of worst states? And why does he oppose reparations?
sarahkendzior	700679178195046400	2016-02-19T13:51:48	aisforamber It does when he makes a causal statement, then adds "all". There are other ways to express appreciation for immigrants.

sarahkendzior	700675232739110912	2016-02-19T13:36:08	Curious if Sanders defines African slaves as "immigrants". Or whether he just ignores like he does Native Americans.

sarahkendzior	700480194453200896	2016-02-19T00:41:07	What Sanders fails to see is that women may not base vote on candidate's gender -- but on whether candidate grasps gender discrimination.
sarahkendzior	700475550557581313	2016-02-19T00:22:40	So reporting on a candidate's actual votes and on endorsements is what passes for "swiftboating" these days? Huh.

sarahkendzior	700313319840722944	2016-02-18T13:38:01	Agree. Should pay more. But in politics, which runs on elitist expectation of unpaid labor, paying at all is notable

sarahkendzior	700102049518649344	2016-02-17T23:38:30	Bizarre to watch the election from St Louis, with its decay and neglect and joblessness, as politicans peddle us unicorns and hate.

sarahkendzior	699243410733969408	2016-02-15T14:46:35	ramoncreager It's not one rando, unfortunately. That's why Bernie and his campaign staff had to tell his supporters to stop harassing ppl.

sarahkendzior	699241053258297344	2016-02-15T14:37:13	ramoncreager Also every time you ask for "proof" of harassment, women are forced to look again at things like this 
sarahkendzior	699240488759472128	2016-02-15T14:34:58	ramoncreager The most frequent targets of harassment are black women. I've witnessed and RTd many of their complaints. Including today.
