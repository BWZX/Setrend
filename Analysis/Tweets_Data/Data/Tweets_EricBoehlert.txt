EricBoehlert	710558042178228224	2016-03-17T20:06:53	Nov a long, long way away. But yeah, this is what a complete GOP implosion could look like

EricBoehlert	710501041813463040	2016-03-17T16:20:23	when he entered public life so many yrs ago, did McConnell ever envision himself making nut job statements like this 
EricBoehlert	710492075050049536	2016-03-17T15:44:45	I think this is due it weak explaining from press and a larger info bubble that develops during a campaign
EricBoehlert	710491848809259008	2016-03-17T15:43:51	can't tell U how many pple I know who dont understand Dem delegates are proportional; i.e. who think if Sanders "wins" CA he'll vault ahead
EricBoehlert	710487507520135170	2016-03-17T15:26:36	thanks  
EricBoehlert	710486956917059584	2016-03-17T15:24:25	note to pundits: just toss away those dopey talking pts you had stored up re: Clinton in general election. she's running vs. TRUMP
EricBoehlert	710486648291782656	2016-03-17T15:23:11	yeah, can you imagine her trying to defend her foreign policy record in a debate vs. Trump next Oct?? 
EricBoehlert	710481242135863296	2016-03-17T15:01:42	I don't get attacking a candidate for "flip-flopping" if you agree with them. Only a fool would value consistency over getting it right.
EricBoehlert	710479688968359936	2016-03-17T14:55:32	if Trump were a famous woman, what would this permanent expression of his be called?

EricBoehlert	710441752969224192	2016-03-17T12:24:47	yeah, b/c in politics the loser always dictates the future.  
EricBoehlert	710439225724964865	2016-03-17T12:14:45	where MSNBC host writes WaPo column abt what he said on MSNBC:  bubble
EricBoehlert	710422002801233920	2016-03-17T11:06:19	The Hillary campaign isn't sweating Trump. Her chief strategist explains why:  
EricBoehlert	710426359965810692	2016-03-17T11:23:37	common DC analysis: Clinton is winning/will be nominee, but he's the *real* force in Dem politics.  
EricBoehlert	710425571101171712	2016-03-17T11:20:29	aka the staff at National Review  
EricBoehlert	710308918640189440	2016-03-17T03:36:57	raises serious Q abt police at these Trump rallies: they often seem to act like his personal security detail, not public safety officers
EricBoehlert	710308172423163904	2016-03-17T03:33:59	yeah that was great move--arresting the guy who got punched at ally, not the guy who threw punch  
EricBoehlert	710285760176459779	2016-03-17T02:04:56	hold hearings. then if you want to try to filibuster--fine  
EricBoehlert	710269591826599936	2016-03-17T01:00:41	Totally unclear to me why ppl should think Garland would be less liberal than Srinivasan. inners
EricBoehlert	710265365465538560	2016-03-17T00:43:53	(I wouldn't have guessed that Cruz has more votes than Sanders)
EricBoehlert	710262857611485184	2016-03-17T00:33:55	the 2008 analogy used to work; no more
EricBoehlert	710262355217649664	2016-03-17T00:31:56	EricBoehlert And about three times as large, in the delegate count.
EricBoehlert	710262102934552576	2016-03-17T00:30:56	for the record, Clinton lead over Sanders is way, way bigger than Obama's lead over Clinton 8 yrs ago in March  
EricBoehlert	710256367777550336	2016-03-17T00:08:08	and boy have they decided this primary season  
EricBoehlert	710253063941005313	2016-03-16T23:55:00	and common sense. (the fact this guy ever had a US president's ear.....)  
EricBoehlert	710226214309470208	2016-03-16T22:08:19	Clinton sweeps Tues, NYT responds w/ column abt how amazing Sanders is and a front-page piece abt how unlikable she is.
EricBoehlert	710225867381850114	2016-03-16T22:06:56	New Republic 2008 demanding Clinton drop out: she's running a "wretched" "kamikaze campaign". 
EricBoehlert	710224516396486656	2016-03-16T22:01:34	2008 link: 
EricBoehlert	710224261370224640	2016-03-16T22:00:33	btw, 3rd column today ive seen urging BS stay in race which i think is fine. note 2008, pundits almost hysterical demanding Clinton drop out
EricBoehlert	710223169269964801	2016-03-16T21:56:13	Clinton has more votes than any 2016 candidate; NYT says you have yo "hold your nose" to vote for her. cool stuff 
EricBoehlert	710221795044016128	2016-03-16T21:50:45	in the end tho, this strategy is going nowhere.
EricBoehlert	710221165650944000	2016-03-16T21:48:15	when there were even hints of this from Clinton's 2008 campaign, she was loudly condemned for days.  
EricBoehlert	710220177393192960	2016-03-16T21:44:20	ha. the latest from Bernie's "Baghdad Bob" writer  
EricBoehlert	710176743433310210	2016-03-16T18:51:44	so GOP is just skipping over the No Hearings part and pretending previous No votes are same thing? amazing  
EricBoehlert	710170846971695108	2016-03-16T18:28:18	raises interesting point: is there ANY respected conservative legal voice backing the GOP's court blockade?  
EricBoehlert	710167300285067264	2016-03-16T18:14:13	noting pundits' muted response to Trump refusing to show up for next debate. if Clinton opts for a similar move the contrast will be telling
EricBoehlert	710148503088013312	2016-03-16T16:59:31	Kirk: Garland's from my state of Illinois!  RNC: U gotta oppose Kirk: i can't even meet w/ him? RNC: no Kirk: my re-elect's doomed RNC: yep

EricBoehlert	710144685830967296	2016-03-16T16:44:21	GOP incoherence is becoming monumental on this issue. they had 4 wks to come up w/ talking pt and this is it??  
EricBoehlert	710143310489395200	2016-03-16T16:38:53	Incoherent 
EricBoehlert	710143315916754944	2016-03-16T16:38:54	Toomey riding his re-elect on the idea SCOTUS nominees don't deserves hearings. bold.  
EricBoehlert	710127401997619200	2016-03-16T15:35:40	great optics for GOP tomorrow when Garland arrives at Senate w/ TV cameras; Republicans won't even meet w/ him
EricBoehlert	710124368052035584	2016-03-16T15:23:37	srsly, when is Congress NOT out of session?
EricBoehlert	710123916036087808	2016-03-16T15:21:49	polling on SCOTUS fight has been slipping away form GOP in last month; it's about to snowball in coming days.
EricBoehlert	710123415793958913	2016-03-16T15:19:50	day after Trump seizes GOP, GOP opts to shred SCOTUS nomination process.
EricBoehlert	710122063638499332	2016-03-16T15:14:28	shorter Obama: really, GOP? really???
EricBoehlert	710121676860747776	2016-03-16T15:12:55	Orrin Hatch, call yr office
EricBoehlert	710119506060771328	2016-03-16T15:04:18	CNN noting Republicans don't like various Garland rulings (detainees etc.)....that's what hearings are for!
EricBoehlert	710110694377725957	2016-03-16T14:29:17	Obama giving GOP a chance to save itself from itself. i.e. you should see who HIllary's gonna nominate!  
EricBoehlert	710109984445562880	2016-03-16T14:26:28	it's possible WH just doesn't see SCOTUS through prism of Nov elections. understandable--since nobody else ever has.
EricBoehlert	710097854090584069	2016-03-16T13:38:16	worked so well stopping Kagen and Sotomayor..... 
EricBoehlert	710094456737771521	2016-03-16T13:24:46	EricBoehlert geoff9cow armandodkos She might, but if the senate flips, all bets are off.
EricBoehlert	710092845529616385	2016-03-16T13:18:21	just given the extraordinary circumstances
EricBoehlert	710092529715306496	2016-03-16T13:17:06	my guess has always been she'll renominate same person  
EricBoehlert	710092224185409536	2016-03-16T13:15:53	Can media really claim that Clinton, who has very strong favorability among Democrats, and Trump are similarly "divisive"? Yes they can.
EricBoehlert	710090385507401728	2016-03-16T13:08:35	DC press for month: Sanders is the Dem version of Trump. today NYT signals new direction: Hillary is the Dem version of Trump. bothsides

EricBoehlert	710078675459289088	2016-03-16T12:22:03	btw, what was the NYT's Rubio's narrative most of the winter? he's a star! he's surging! he's right where he wants to be.
EricBoehlert	710078358369906688	2016-03-16T12:20:47	when Bernie loses every race on Tues, don't show up in my mentions on Weds w/ Shillary nonsense.  
EricBoehlert	710077589122097152	2016-03-16T12:17:44	punchline: a GOP Rep....at Hooters  
EricBoehlert	710076864547594243	2016-03-16T12:14:51	this is what happens when a newsroom adopts a Clinton narrative--and the narrative turns out to be wrong.
EricBoehlert	710076629716865024	2016-03-16T12:13:55	note that Clinton remains extraordinarily popular among Dems. but NYT omits that polling data; opts for anecdotal journalism.
EricBoehlert	710075154731106309	2016-03-16T12:08:04	Clinton wins FL, NC, OH, MO, IL....NYT announces she's "weak" and unlikable.

EricBoehlert	710074346417614848	2016-03-16T12:04:51	None of the top 10 highest-paid Bernie Sanders staffers are women:  
EricBoehlert	710066482781294592	2016-03-16T11:33:36	this, of course, aft news orgs last year held collective meetings to complain abt Clinton campaign press behavior----how quaint
EricBoehlert	710064994323451904	2016-03-16T11:27:41	everybody follow bracketboy NCAATOURNAMENT
EricBoehlert	710064315466964992	2016-03-16T11:24:59	so far, not one news org has stood up to Trump, which is why SURPRISE the bullying continues.
EricBoehlert	710060648332394496	2016-03-16T11:10:25	and Politico is going to do what in response?? 
EricBoehlert	709960425258016770	2016-03-16T04:32:10	what if, for some bizarre reason, Clinton also wanted to 'pen' reporters. By already letting Trump do it, reporters would have no recourse
EricBoehlert	709959039606726657	2016-03-16T04:26:40	still surprised news orgs haven't collectively, and loudly, challenged Trump campaign re: access.
EricBoehlert	709958176003788801	2016-03-16T04:23:14	so what's Politico going to do, institutionally, in response?  
EricBoehlert	709956778222620674	2016-03-16T04:17:40	note last time this topic flared was right after she won Iowa. Clinton victories tend to spark odd responses.... 
EricBoehlert	709949845163921409	2016-03-16T03:50:07	this is same paper that spends MONTHS touting rising star Marco Rubio. smh
EricBoehlert	709949521376182276	2016-03-16T03:48:50	Clinton has virtually sewn up the nomination; leads Trump by double digits in Nov polls. so NYT tonight describes her as "weak."
EricBoehlert	709947980883877888	2016-03-16T03:42:43	when she wins WH, NYT front page next day is going to be, "U.S. Elects First Woman President; Some Voters Find Her Unlikeable"
EricBoehlert	709947482285993984	2016-03-16T03:40:44	for the record, Trump's net unfavorables are TRIPLE Clinton's (via NBC poll). so NYT presents them as equal

EricBoehlert	707605721253322753	2016-03-09T16:35:25	i'd be shocked if it actually happened, but again for context, a 13-pt loss would mean GOP losing places like MO, AZ, NC, IN, etc
EricBoehlert	707603029957148672	2016-03-09T16:24:43	just context-wise, a 13-pt loss would be Goldwater-esque for GOP.  (Obama crushed McCain by 7 pts)
EricBoehlert	707602672329887744	2016-03-09T16:23:18	ha. same day NBC poll has Clinton routing Trump by 13 pts in Nov. (i.e. this is the RNC panic plan)  
EricBoehlert	707584510716735488	2016-03-09T15:11:08	crazy part is reporter was from Breitbart, a site that doubles as Trump's biggest cheerleader.
EricBoehlert	707583565656100865	2016-03-09T15:07:22	wow. Trump's spox physically grabbed a reporter and tried to pull her to the ground.  
EricBoehlert	707571578297516032	2016-03-09T14:19:44	i.e. Obama lost MI, FL, OH and CA in 2008 primary and then won them all in Nov.   are pple claiming there's connection btw primary and Nov?
EricBoehlert	707570011196538880	2016-03-09T14:13:31	yes, Clinton is winning red states--and Obama did same thing during 2008 primary: SC, AL, LA, MS, ID, GA, UT, ND, KS  what's the point?
EricBoehlert	707557597956669441	2016-03-09T13:24:11	but those were CNBC experts: they *knew* Obama was ruining the U.S. economy.....
EricBoehlert	707557238525788160	2016-03-09T13:22:46	and it wsn't just jimcramer. ALL the CNBC experts thought Obama's stimulus was the worst 
EricBoehlert	707556863429189632	2016-03-09T13:21:16	7 yrs ago this wk, when CNBC declared war on Obama (his 6th wk in office); (via mmfa) 
EricBoehlert	707551029265612801	2016-03-09T12:58:05	WaPo has pub'd 430 Clinton emails stories in the last year. but i guess she's been "coddled".... 
EricBoehlert	707545503450439680	2016-03-09T12:36:08	Clinton's lead over Trump expands

EricBoehlert	707435880512888833	2016-03-09T05:20:32	ftr, that's how Obama  won the 2008 nomination--big delegate wins in the Deep South.  
EricBoehlert	707432182701232128	2016-03-09T05:05:50	indeed. idea that Trump can win MI in Nov is dopiest pipe dream ever  
EricBoehlert	707427020649709569	2016-03-09T04:45:19	I mean, when turnout is low it's bad news for Clinton. when turnout is high it's also bad news for Clinton?
EricBoehlert	707426398890303489	2016-03-09T04:42:51	by that logic, the huge 2008 Dem primary turnout was driven by....Obama's vulnerabilities.

EricBoehlert	707397971944599553	2016-03-09T02:49:53	absolutely appalling that every network covered the guy hawking steaks instead of the former secretary of state.
EricBoehlert	707400904912314369	2016-03-09T03:01:33	hey she's only going to be the first woman president in US history--lets ignore her

EricBoehlert	707370211243122688	2016-03-09T00:59:35	I liked when Fox News moderators hosted debate in Michigan and spent 90 seconds on Flint..... 
EricBoehlert	707369526053236736	2016-03-09T00:56:51	these numbers are amazing
EricBoehlert	707357607913201664	2016-03-09T00:09:30	3/4 of NYT's recent campaign coverage has been "horse race." this is what happens to policy:  
EricBoehlert	707348187128930304	2016-03-08T23:32:04	ha. Trump continues to light a fire under Dem voters.   
EricBoehlert	707328700908441601	2016-03-08T22:14:38	this also  
EricBoehlert	707328020089073665	2016-03-08T22:11:56	glad i'm not in the polling biz....
EricBoehlert	707327701888192513	2016-03-08T22:10:40	so this new *national* NBC/WSJ poll is based on less than 400 GOP respondents.
EricBoehlert	707322429325099008	2016-03-08T21:49:43	ha. shocking. older white men at southern golf club don't vote Democratic.  
EricBoehlert	707305770589798400	2016-03-08T20:43:31	the Fox Effect. (I.e. RW media created a GOP platform that's pure fantasy--GOP elites just noticing)  
EricBoehlert	707304769312919552	2016-03-08T20:39:32	Best campaign season ever  
EricBoehlert	707285120957415424	2016-03-08T19:21:28	this Michigan editorial board doesn't think the bailout question is that complicated
EricBoehlert	707281691941978113	2016-03-08T19:07:50	McConnell want to confirm O's SCOTUS pick as majority leader, or confirm Clinton's SCOTUS pick as minority leader? 
EricBoehlert	707278623737249792	2016-03-08T18:55:39	disaster relief $$ for Sandy was blocked under "overreach."    
EricBoehlert	707276560022134785	2016-03-08T18:47:27	One pretty big difference here is that Dem “overreach” consisted of Mitt Romney’s health care plan. 
EricBoehlert	707276615714209792	2016-03-08T18:47:40	it's generally embarrassing  
EricBoehlert	707275435684585473	2016-03-08T18:42:59	when paywalls become yr friend.  
EricBoehlert	707274630277500928	2016-03-08T18:39:47	no campaign has ever received this much coverage. and no campaign has ever got so much wrong?  
EricBoehlert	707257893993766912	2016-03-08T17:33:16	GOP smacking around a Latino or African-American jurist all summer--that'll be great look for Nov.  
EricBoehlert	707250254110986243	2016-03-08T17:02:55	i think press so tied to Hillary's-not-likeable, Hillary's-not-inspiring, that they can't picture her out front of possible Dem Wave.
EricBoehlert	707243192547196930	2016-03-08T16:34:51	ha. no wonder the Dem's Sunday night debate ratings were down.  
EricBoehlert	707237079697248257	2016-03-08T16:10:34	(spoiler: he wrote long condemnation of Clinton's corrupt superdelegate lead w/o noting Sanders' campaign guy invented them)
EricBoehlert	707235923327655936	2016-03-08T16:05:58	yet still not a peep in the press abt possible Dem Wave election on the horizon  
EricBoehlert	707235211029966853	2016-03-08T16:03:08	does he understand that Sanders campaign guru Tad Devine helped create superdelegate system?  
EricBoehlert	707234197308452869	2016-03-08T15:59:07	This article is ludicrous. Shaun clearly isn’t a political analyst. He should stick to the police brutality beat.  
EricBoehlert	707228146274312197	2016-03-08T15:35:04	what's yr pt? that 80 of America's 90 gun deaths everyday don't count? I mean....

EricBoehlert	704051233686945795	2016-02-28T21:11:09	odd that Sanders fans are touting lower Dem turnout this year--which completely collapses their  claim of a Sanders-led voter revolution.

EricBoehlert	703951881832439809	2016-02-28T14:36:22	I suspect much of that was driven not by sober review of demographics etc but a desire to pile on Clinton.
