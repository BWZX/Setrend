JonHenke	697871834214178816	2016-02-11T19:56:25	MBarakso That would be a ludicrous claim. Where did I imply it?
JonHenke	697869743370403840	2016-02-11T19:48:07	MBarakso Read my first piece. There is wildly disproportionate coverage of the Right$ already and virtually none of the Left$.

JonHenke	697213228884090880	2016-02-10T00:19:22	If your news organization depends on access, then you are a largely owned subsidiary of the administration. Nobody bucks this. Which sucks.
JonHenke	697212935773544449	2016-02-10T00:18:12	If, for example, you are a reporter covering the FCC and the Chairman’s office dislikes you? You are out of a job.

JonHenke	696788392210755584	2016-02-08T20:11:13	brainfertilizer Not sure what to tell you. It’s readily available online. Barton is backing Cruz. 
JonHenke	696784831892561920	2016-02-08T19:57:04	brainfertilizer I very much doubt Cruz would want to respond.
JonHenke	696784688728444928	2016-02-08T19:56:30	brainfertilizer Because it’s common knowledge. You googling it is more scalable than a dozen tweets asking me to check it for you.
JonHenke	696784492363706368	2016-02-08T19:55:43	brainfertilizer Cruz is against SSM, but has retreated to the “let state’s decide” position. Which is untenable, of course.
JonHenke	696784282279350272	2016-02-08T19:54:53	brainfertilizer Look it up. Barton is very much in Cruz’s corner.
JonHenke	696783664953368577	2016-02-08T19:52:25	brainfertilizer I am not accusing him of agreeing with his father. I am asking how he would respond.
JonHenke	696782724091289601	2016-02-08T19:48:41	brainfertilizer Yes. Relevance? I’d still like to hear how Cruz would respond to the matters raised in the oped.
JonHenke	696782611541266433	2016-02-08T19:48:14	brainfertilizer Again, are you serious? Cruz and Barton are close. Barton runs his Super-PAC.
JonHenke	696781928431775744	2016-02-08T19:45:31	brainfertilizer Are you serious? You think Cruz hasn’t been vocally critical of SSM?!?
JonHenke	696781786802733057	2016-02-08T19:44:58	brainfertilizer Aside from the Rafael Cruz, David Barton stuff? Cruz hasn’t exactly been shy about the “Christian nation” rhetoric.

JonHenke	689249137137729537	2016-01-19T00:52:54	@marisalovexox So you would fine people for saying words you find offensive? As offensive as slurs can be, that is worse.
JonHenke	689248798464413696	2016-01-19T00:51:33	@marisalovexox Sure, and humans disagree about what is offensive and what is not, too.
JonHenke	689248669778972672	2016-01-19T00:51:03	joseiswriting Not very clear, but I’m inferring that you would not actually support outlawing the term “illegals”.
JonHenke	689248386000752640	2016-01-19T00:49:55	@marisalovexox Of course. I teach my kids that. I don’t try to put people in jail for saying words I find offensive.
JonHenke	689248246477225985	2016-01-19T00:49:22	@marisalovexox I can understand the objection to “illegals”. I’m just shocked at the idea that somebody would want offensive words outlawed.

JonHenke	686684712954388480	2016-01-11T23:02:48	KatyontheHill bskorup New formats, sometimes catch on and spread widely (e.g., AOR, Hot AC), but most fail or stay niche (e.g., AAA, etc).
JonHenke	686683433838460928	2016-01-11T22:57:43	KatyontheHill bskorup What I’d like to see is proof of concept of viable new models. Not just individual stations. Widely replicated.
JonHenke	686682995273666561	2016-01-11T22:55:58	bskorup KatyontheHill But it’s difficult to see the need for 10-20 radio stations per market, when internet fills niches better.
JonHenke	686682839589457920	2016-01-11T22:55:21	bskorup KatyontheHill In the short term, radio will continue going the way of TV — more national programming, more syndication.
JonHenke	686682587276902400	2016-01-11T22:54:21	bskorup KatyontheHill Even so, radio stations have less long-term viability and no spectrum auction exit opportunity.
JonHenke	686682368002912258	2016-01-11T22:53:29	bskorup KatyontheHill That’s a good point. Cross-ownership prohibitions lead to 5+ struggling news departments, when 2-3 could succeed.
JonHenke	686682022182547456	2016-01-11T22:52:06	KatyontheHill It could work in some places, but not for 15,000 radio stations. So we’re back to the excess capacity problem.
JonHenke	686681887910326273	2016-01-11T22:51:34	KatyontheHill Bottom line is, extensive localism requires a lot of resources. Syndication is less expensive.
JonHenke	686681684973064193	2016-01-11T22:50:46	KatyontheHill There is some value to localism, but there just aren’t many examples of stations succeeding based on localism.
JonHenke	686675021620711424	2016-01-11T22:24:17	KatyontheHill Many stations tried being more local, but it’s not much of a silver bullet. Localism is expensive.
JonHenke	686674873951858688	2016-01-11T22:23:42	KatyontheHill Sell to who? The problem is that there just isn’t enough demand for 15,000 radio stations.
