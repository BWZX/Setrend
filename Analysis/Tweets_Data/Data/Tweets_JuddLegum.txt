JuddLegum	718108916723408898	2016-04-07T16:11:22	crushingbort difference is a practical one. arguing you are more qualified rather than opponent is unqualified makes it easier to endorse

JuddLegum	717889526635565056	2016-04-07T01:39:35	10. Yes, it's not the easiest or most traditional way to "win," but that is never what the Trump campaign has been about.
JuddLegum	717889380690620416	2016-04-07T01:39:00	9. A contested convention keeps things weird. It allows him to keep doing what he's doing.
JuddLegum	717889298809405441	2016-04-07T01:38:41	8. Trump talks about pivoting to be more presidential, but you can tell his heart isn't in it.
JuddLegum	717889224993845248	2016-04-07T01:38:23	7. Trump has been winning for a long time. But that's almost happenstance to the core strategy, which is stirring shit up.
JuddLegum	717889117489610753	2016-04-07T01:37:58	6. If he fails, it effectively justifies whatever he wants to do. But more importantly, it keeps the spotlight brightly on him.
JuddLegum	717889038489923586	2016-04-07T01:37:39	5. It also presents him with the ultimate "deal" to close. If he's able to deliver, it underscores his core rationale.
JuddLegum	717888928360108032	2016-04-07T01:37:12	4. A contested convention has all of the elements Trump needs to thrive: chaos, anger, a deep sense of injustice.
JuddLegum	717888853739225088	2016-04-07T01:36:55	3. For Trump, a contested convention plays into his strengths. The more normal the situation, the worse for Trump.
JuddLegum	717888719039160320	2016-04-07T01:36:23	2. I think a contested convention is good for Trump. He's probably looking forward to it.
JuddLegum	717888645634633731	2016-04-07T01:36:05	1. Conventional wisdom is that Trump desperately needs to avoid a contested convention, I disagree.

JuddLegum	702867774130003969	2016-02-25T14:48:30	5. I can't believe that's true. Seems like Rubio's heart isn't in it, TBH
JuddLegum	702867697017753600	2016-02-25T14:48:12	4. Does Rubio really think that a half-hearted criticism of Trump on Obamacare will move the needle, even a little bit?
JuddLegum	702867487969419266	2016-02-25T14:47:22	3. Does Rubio recall that, in 2012, Romney won the Republican nomination. He practically INVENTED Obamacare
JuddLegum	702867381085990914	2016-02-25T14:46:56	2. One of his main attacks is that Trump "thinks parts of Obamacare are pretty good"
JuddLegum	702866582247182336	2016-02-25T14:43:46	1. Let's talk about how pathetic Marco Rubio's new attacks on Donald Trump are
JuddLegum	702687483100864512	2016-02-25T02:52:05	17. Now they are left with two main rivals. One spent most of the campaign praising Trump. The other still hasn't attacked him.
JuddLegum	702687275315044352	2016-02-25T02:51:16	16. The candidates claimed that not attacking Trump was a strategic move but actually, they were just afraid of offending his base.
JuddLegum	702687028228595712	2016-02-25T02:50:17	15. Instead of attacking Trump, they claimed he was just a distraction
JuddLegum	702686843133886464	2016-02-25T02:49:33	14. Instead, all the Republicans, right down to Jeb Bush, insisted they would support Trump as the nominee
JuddLegum	702686693204353024	2016-02-25T02:48:57	13. Racism, sexism, xenophobia. We've pretty much seen it all this campaign.
JuddLegum	702686501805690881	2016-02-25T02:48:11	12. In the current campaign the GOP could have denounced Trump as an unacceptable candidate. There were plenty of reasons.
JuddLegum	702685507550056451	2016-02-25T02:44:14	11. Trump is just playing into an energized base that the GOP establishment created.
JuddLegum	702685424448376833	2016-02-25T02:43:55	10. Instead, the GOP played to the base and validated their nativist sentiments.
JuddLegum	702685289387581440	2016-02-25T02:43:22	9. This was the approach favored by the last Republican president and, until this campaign started, many of the candidates.
JuddLegum	702685212329771008	2016-02-25T02:43:04	8. Had it passed and became law, it could have been a strength of Republicans.
JuddLegum	702685166712524800	2016-02-25T02:42:53	7. Immigration reform passed the Senate and had the votes to pass in the House. Leadership refused to let it come up for a vote.
JuddLegum	702685071703216128	2016-02-25T02:42:31	6. The GOP could have passed comprehensive immigration reform.
JuddLegum	702685008314703873	2016-02-25T02:42:15	5. The issue where Trump is most extreme, like immigration, he's just following the lead of the party.
JuddLegum	702684899078246400	2016-02-25T02:41:49	4. No. Instead, Romney actively sought Trump's endorsement and proudly touted his support at an event. 
JuddLegum	702684748603383808	2016-02-25T02:41:13	3. They could have said that bigots like Trump have no place in the Republican Party. Did they do that?
JuddLegum	702684659751239681	2016-02-25T02:40:52	2. In 2012, when Trump was on the birther stuff, the GOP could have denounced him as a bigot and conspiracy theorist.
JuddLegum	702684602905862145	2016-02-25T02:40:39	1. Let's talk about all the things the Republican establishment did to enable Donald Trump
