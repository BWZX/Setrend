gdebenedetti	709913524483411968	2016-03-16T01:25:48	PHOENIX — Forget the results. Looks like it's gonna be the standard stump speech for Sanders here tonight. 
gdebenedetti	709912128094740480	2016-03-16T01:20:15	PHOENIX — Before Illinois and Missouri results land, BernieSanders is up, speaking to a large crowd that was starting to get a bit deflated
gdebenedetti	709909478280290304	2016-03-16T01:09:43	The other night Clinton said she wouldn't preview her anti-Trump lines of attack, but it sure sounds like she's starting to do just that.

gdebenedetti	709900799564877825	2016-03-16T00:35:14	You can see why Clinton spent time in FL and NC in the final days: building delegate margins. FL: up 32% (72% in). NC: up 20% (8% in).

gdebenedetti	709892474680913920	2016-03-16T00:02:09	The big difference here: Sanders spent considerably on TV ads in Florida in the end. 
gdebenedetti	709889737335517184	2016-03-15T23:51:17	Clinton has managed to run up the delegate score in big states where Sanders doesn't compete much—look at TX/GA. Hoping for a repeat in FL.
gdebenedetti	709889280210915328	2016-03-15T23:49:28	Keep an eye on Florida tonight for the Ds. Clinton looking to run up the delegate total *big time*. She's up 66%-32% w over 28% reporting.

gdebenedetti	709418452407214080	2016-03-14T16:38:34	Hillary Clinton wants to win on March 15 so she can wholly focus on Trump on March 16. This quote shows that:

gdebenedetti	709207305376681985	2016-03-14T02:39:32	COLUMBUS, Ohio — This race is close between Clinton and Sanders. But yet again, the night was about Trump. 
gdebenedetti	709205382808408065	2016-03-14T02:31:54	Clinton's line on coal was of course part of a broader response on transitioning to clean energy. But a messy soundbite nonetheless.

gdebenedetti	709192978036817920	2016-03-14T01:42:36	Clinton says foreign leaders have asked her if they can endorse her, in hopes of stopping Trump.
gdebenedetti	709192622699634688	2016-03-14T01:41:12	"There are many arguments against Trump. I'm not going to spill the beans tonight. But suffice it to say there are many." - Clinton re Trump

gdebenedetti	709187443145187329	2016-03-14T01:20:37	But Clinton makes clear she's struggled with the death penalty Q. Focused on mass killings. Questioner says he's satisfied with the answer.
gdebenedetti	709187159220228100	2016-03-14T01:19:29	Clinton says she still supports death penalty—specifically for federal cases. Invokes terrorism. Then: "What happened to you was a travesty"
gdebenedetti	709186635137728512	2016-03-14T01:17:24	Whoa. Questioner @ town hall spent 39 years in prison, some on death row, for a murder he didn't commit. Asks Clinton about death penalty.

gdebenedetti	709182359145455617	2016-03-14T01:00:25	Bernie qualified this by pointing out Inhofe denies climate change, and that he's "really, really conservative." 
gdebenedetti	709182058174812161	2016-03-14T00:59:13	Sanders, pressed, says the name of a Republican he likes: Jim Inhofe!

gdebenedetti	709176203886915584	2016-03-14T00:35:57	"I do not believe in privately controlled charter schools," Sanders tells undecided charter teacher. Then, @ OSU, hits football salaries.

gdebenedetti	709174030037815296	2016-03-14T00:27:19	"Let me rephrase," Sanders then says. "Nobody RATIONAL is talking about building a wall." 
gdebenedetti	709173631855812608	2016-03-14T00:25:44	Sanders on trade: "Nobody is talking about building a wall around the United States. [audience giggles] Oh, wait, there is one guy."

gdebenedetti	703771721640226819	2016-02-28T02:40:28	Seems noteworthy that Sanders so far has not gone after Clinton. Big choice for him now after South Carolina rout.

gdebenedetti	703768695886053376	2016-02-28T02:28:27	With 99% of SC's results in, Clinton's got a legitimate blowout at 74%-26%. This was not quite what Sanders was expecting when he landed.

gdebenedetti	703719243947225088	2016-02-27T23:11:56	With SC polls closing in under an hour, it looks like Sanders will be in the air (without wifi) en route Minnesota as the race is called.

gdebenedetti	695077981228830720	2016-02-04T02:54:39	Why do candidates like these forums? An opportunity to basically recite the stump speech for a much bigger audience in a calmer environment.
gdebenedetti	695077762638442496	2016-02-04T02:53:47	Sanders is talking down his singing BUT he did just sing with Vampire Weekend for 4,000 Iowans last week...

gdebenedetti	695069126822387713	2016-02-04T02:19:28	Worth noting here that Sanders was the first-ever non-Christian to win delegates in a presidential race 
gdebenedetti	695068362657959940	2016-02-04T02:16:26	"I would not be here tonight, I would not be running for POTUS, if I did not have very strong spiritual &amp; religious feelings" - Sanders
gdebenedetti	695068048584216576	2016-02-04T02:15:11	This could've become a pretty interesting nationalized race if O'Malley had ever caught on. 
gdebenedetti	695065894511321089	2016-02-04T02:06:37	"How do you not underperform here," Anderson Cooper asks about polls showing Sanders up 20+  Sanders: "That's a media game! Who cares?"
gdebenedetti	695065541288058880	2016-02-04T02:05:13	"Of course we're an underdog. We are taking on the most powerful political organization in the country, the clinton organization." - Sanders

gdebenedetti	688929583010295808	2016-01-18T03:43:06	This is why O'Malley's complaining.  
gdebenedetti	688929353074356224	2016-01-18T03:42:12	"He's going to start at the kitchen table, we'll see how it goes and go from there," HillaryClinton says of billclinton's White House role
gdebenedetti	688927590212591616	2016-01-18T03:35:11	Was Sanders channeling Killer Mike here? Must've missed it.

gdebenedetti	688911499771908096	2016-01-18T02:31:15	By releasing his plan just 2 hours before the debate, Team Sanders appeared to be betting Clinton wouldn't be ready for an attack right here
