CitySamuel	726172270096465925	2016-04-29T22:12:15	owolade14 thank you
CitySamuel	726131599721529344	2016-04-29T19:30:38	The unthinking kneejerk dismissals of anti-semitism and moral contortions to explain it away have been, and I really mean this, shameful.

CitySamuel	726086239573708801	2016-04-29T16:30:24	salvadore007 I think too many do. Since there are alternatives eg "Israeli gov", "Israeli army", why risk confusion
CitySamuel	726083257595510786	2016-04-29T16:18:33	salvadore007 yes but "Zionism" has been used as code for Jew too often. Hence the neo-Nazi slur "zio". So why not use words with more care?
CitySamuel	726081676967837701	2016-04-29T16:12:16	salvadore007 seemingly small change, but one will get you taken seriously and the other not.

CitySamuel	726080948090097664	2016-04-29T16:09:22	salvadore007 here's how to criticise Israel without being anti-Semitic: "the Israeli army is guilty of terrible human rights abuses".
