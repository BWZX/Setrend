hiltzikm	717770781791485952	2016-04-06T17:47:44	Right, not randomly distrib. It's documented that participation skewed toward higher income in DC vs DB 
hiltzikm	717770591915393025	2016-04-06T17:46:59	Showing me lwr costs for bigger DC plan doesn't tell me anything @ corresponding costs for DB plans. Where's that? 
hiltzikm	717770256341708800	2016-04-06T17:45:39	Yeah: wealthier employees more likely to participate in DC plans. Agg savings conceal inequality in account balances 
hiltzikm	717770040238587905	2016-04-06T17:44:47	Over time ret plans have moved from DB =&gt; DC, ie, from less to more unequal plans, which this chart shows 
hiltzikm	717769794091663360	2016-04-06T17:43:49	Hardly: A $1B DB plan will have much lower trans costs than indiv small retirement plans adding up to $1 b in assets 
hiltzikm	717769356927754240	2016-04-06T17:42:04	It shows distrib of DC worse than DB; since plans have shifted from DB=&gt;DC over time, it translates into time series 
hiltzikm	717768914864881666	2016-04-06T17:40:19	This chart shows how inequality is greater in retirement savings than in working income:

hiltzikm	717766852424765440	2016-04-06T17:32:07	Pay special attention to this one, showing striking inequality in participation in DC v DB:

hiltzikm	717762442042994688	2016-04-06T17:14:36	In other words, there is a crisis and pretending it doesn't exist doesn't work

hiltzikm	709578848065617920	2016-03-15T03:15:55	Hillary Clinton struggled to explain Obamacare to a layperson. But she's not to blame:

hiltzikm	709497304395350016	2016-03-14T21:51:53	That's what he thinks

hiltzikm	709207859599319040	2016-03-14T02:41:44	Prob true. Also, if questioner is oft-unemployed, why no subsidies?

hiltzikm	709204511277985793	2016-03-14T02:28:26	Not a bad answer from her on ACA, but what's missing: "if GOP gets in, you won't have any insurance at all" 
hiltzikm	709191084543385601	2016-03-14T01:35:05	I have to say. TFOB is just a fantastic cultural institution. &gt;100,000 people brought together for the love of books. + Tucson is cool.
hiltzikm	709183904213676032	2016-03-14T01:06:33	"Huh?????" Of the year  
hiltzikm	709175989922705408	2016-03-14T00:35:06	If this is a turning point for democracy as he claims, no excuse for his not taking a stand vs Trump right now  
hiltzikm	709174364730560513	2016-03-14T00:28:39	To me, totally dishonest: the only honest response after 1st 10 mins was to say, "no, I won't support him. Period. 
hiltzikm	709173921736568832	2016-03-14T00:26:53	Rubio showed a real absence of character on that press conference 
hiltzikm	709173224681054208	2016-03-14T00:24:07	He can't say Trump is an elemental threat to Democracy, yet leave open door to supporting him-- that's "leadership"? 
hiltzikm	709172915791470592	2016-03-14T00:22:53	Nonsense: he needs to say it now, or his attack has no meaning whatsoever 
hiltzikm	709172315020374016	2016-03-14T00:20:30	Indescribable hypocrisy--after slamming trump for 10 mins, Rubio refuses to say he won't support him as nominee 
hiltzikm	709052990527643648	2016-03-13T16:26:21	Let's dispel with the notion that Trump doesn't know what he's doing  
hiltzikm	709025344163094528	2016-03-13T14:36:29	Well, mission accomplished. 
hiltzikm	708885666134765568	2016-03-13T05:21:27	Pretty excited for America to shift to a primarily riot-based economy.

hiltzikm	708845680056336384	2016-03-13T02:42:34	Is it because they both had the same hairdo?

hiltzikm	708746089696866306	2016-03-12T20:06:50	Like Zeno's paradox--to GOP, always getting close, but never quite there. To all else, was disqualified months ago

hiltzikm	708426410889650176	2016-03-11T22:56:32	Must-read: the Gettysburg Address, Donald Trump version: 
hiltzikm	708311047224975361	2016-03-11T15:18:08	The feds slam a big water agency for cooking its books -- but they didn't go far enough 
hiltzikm	708176585841455105	2016-03-11T06:23:50	Same thing happens to me when a commercial airs pitching "a Lexus." 
hiltzikm	708125939037646848	2016-03-11T03:02:34	Easy for Rubio to say he'll just retire at 68. Let's see him do that after working as a hod carrier for his entire career.
hiltzikm	708125639224655872	2016-03-11T03:01:23	Anyone can have a good night when there's nothing at stake 
hiltzikm	708124951153221633	2016-03-11T02:58:39	And Disney characters  
hiltzikm	708103816982319104	2016-03-11T01:34:40	The feds slam a big water agency for cooking its books--but they didn't go far enough 
hiltzikm	707791176170995712	2016-03-10T04:52:21	All of which- I predict- will suck  
hiltzikm	707696514777227264	2016-03-09T22:36:12	You mean "dispels with"  
hiltzikm	707694152486490112	2016-03-09T22:26:48	One of the people running for President? 
hiltzikm	707693443477217280	2016-03-09T22:23:59	Lee Atwater wasn't proud of his attacks on Dukakis, and like Marco he didn't fess up till he was on his deathbed  
hiltzikm	707692368095371264	2016-03-09T22:19:43	Well, she should know  
hiltzikm	707662156724965376	2016-03-09T20:19:40	GE shows how to make shareholders richer and retirees poorer 
hiltzikm	707372286202937344	2016-03-09T01:07:50	That's pretty much calling it a complete failure of acting and directing, as it already was of writing. 
hiltzikm	707346193257406464	2016-03-08T23:24:08	JohnBartelloni AmberNiblock I'm afraid I'm not configured that way.

hiltzikm	707296613107040256	2016-03-08T20:07:08	AmberNiblock Watched it and read it; you're still wrong.
hiltzikm	707237083903975425	2016-03-08T16:10:35	It's decided, and it wants no one 
hiltzikm	707232462271684608	2016-03-08T15:52:13	In the new days too 
hiltzikm	707231448244232192	2016-03-08T15:48:11	Keurig make the worst coffee, so ...nope. 
hiltzikm	707224489826750464	2016-03-08T15:20:32	You're wrong; read the transcript. 
hiltzikm	706914093567873024	2016-03-07T18:47:08	Kim Kardashian tweeted a nude selfie today. If Kim wants us to see a part of her we've never seen, she's gonna have to swallow the camera.

hiltzikm	707053323422072832	2016-03-08T04:00:23	I'm usually early 
hiltzikm	707042294545821697	2016-03-08T03:16:33	Tell me again how Obamacare is a 'disaster' 
hiltzikm	707042231534821376	2016-03-08T03:16:18	The Supreme Court just made your healthcare comparison shopping much harder 
hiltzikm	707042143081144320	2016-03-08T03:15:57	The bullet train is troubled, but California needs it: 
hiltzikm	707041458264473602	2016-03-08T03:13:14	How Sanders got the gun makers' liability issue dead wrong (and got an attaboy from the NRA): 
hiltzikm	707041007934709760	2016-03-08T03:11:27	Standing on the shoulders of prof bagley.. 
hiltzikm	707034935115157504	2016-03-08T02:47:19	He's got them right where he wants them 
hiltzikm	707031114586533888	2016-03-08T02:32:08	Early you're holding something to eat 
hiltzikm	706967813336932354	2016-03-07T22:20:36	Clearly never had to try cogitating 
hiltzikm	706955707375968256	2016-03-07T21:32:29	No, Sen. Sanders: ending the gun industry's legal immunity woudn't end gun making in America 
hiltzikm	706875207420551168	2016-03-07T16:12:37	Especially about Trump 
hiltzikm	706874176938770432	2016-03-07T16:08:31	Rule numbr one: "I'm never wrong, though sometimes my timing is off" 
hiltzikm	706700723946323968	2016-03-07T04:39:17	Turns out you CAN have an intelligent, substantive debate between candidates who disagree. Who knew?
hiltzikm	706697944091664384	2016-03-07T04:28:14	Trump would have a word for you 
hiltzikm	706697477097828352	2016-03-07T04:26:23	You know, if you leave the airlock, often you die 
hiltzikm	706686420140687360	2016-03-07T03:42:26	Forget you and your needs, let's talk about Trump 
hiltzikm	706607713287933952	2016-03-06T22:29:41	Let's see him win the Florida primary, then 
hiltzikm	706607427634929664	2016-03-06T22:28:33	He's almost, but not quite, entirely unlike a viable candidate* *apologies to Douglas Adams 
hiltzikm	706606019690954753	2016-03-06T22:22:57	Can we dispel with the notion that Puerto Rico has even a single vote in the electoral college? 
hiltzikm	706605411751714816	2016-03-06T22:20:32	Puerto Rico electoral votes: 0 
hiltzikm	706563882609803267	2016-03-06T19:35:31	He was a fictional character masquerading as a real politician too

hiltzikm	706503263579824130	2016-03-06T15:34:38	Love, unrequited 
hiltzikm	706372309360070656	2016-03-06T06:54:16	Pass on both, thanks 
hiltzikm	706343180933836801	2016-03-06T04:58:32	Truer words were never spoken 
hiltzikm	706340575889354752	2016-03-06T04:48:11	Back at 'ya! 
hiltzikm	706340419550883841	2016-03-06T04:47:33	How bad is the retirement crisis? These six horrifying charts spell it out. 
hiltzikm	706340343453646853	2016-03-06T04:47:15	The new 'liberal' Supreme Court just blew a hole into your ability to comparison shop for healthcare: 
hiltzikm	706340141703393280	2016-03-06T04:46:27	The bullet train is troubled, but it's the key to California's future prosperity: 
hiltzikm	706340015240929280	2016-03-06T04:45:57	Here are the cold hard facts; now tell me again how Obamacare is a 'disaster': 
hiltzikm	706241258860097537	2016-03-05T22:13:32	"I had the wrong policies, the wrong manners, the wrong language...what did i do right?" 
hiltzikm	706240101890666496	2016-03-05T22:08:56	Seems like the perfect place to not expand Medicaid 
hiltzikm	706230363861811200	2016-03-05T21:30:14	Right, Like Fannie &amp; Freddie. Govt has responsibility to make sure employers don't skip out on obligations--has it? 
hiltzikm	706228682688319488	2016-03-05T21:23:33	PBGC goes bankrupt only if our political leaders allow it. Who are they looking out for? 
hiltzikm	706216157699665920	2016-03-05T20:33:47	And the GOP congress reduced the guarantee in 2014. 
hiltzikm	706212563856429056	2016-03-05T20:19:30	Except, as you yourself observe, they're covered by the PBGC--unlike 401k plans 
hiltzikm	706183423560265729	2016-03-05T18:23:43	A little late: I covered this issue las summer:  
hiltzikm	706156168612163584	2016-03-05T16:35:25	Also, I'm sorry, but Channing Tatum is not Gene Kelly and anyone who claims he is never saw Gene Kelly dance.. 
hiltzikm	706152651113648129	2016-03-05T16:21:26	Because it wasn't funny and the movies-within-a-movie didn't really look like movies 
hiltzikm	706149773112451076	2016-03-05T16:10:00	mckaycoppins kind of a dumb rule tho
hiltzikm	706139969086042113	2016-03-05T15:31:02	Okay, then it's the second stupidest show on TV 
hiltzikm	706008131612979200	2016-03-05T06:47:10	Time to find something intelligent to watch, which means changing the channel 
hiltzikm	706007628632043521	2016-03-05T06:45:10	You want to see it done right, watch HoC (UK), the original...truly spectacular 
hiltzikm	706004191420874752	2016-03-05T06:31:30	At least the kardashians know they're stupid. HOC thinks it's smart 
hiltzikm	706003404204552192	2016-03-05T06:28:23	The night is young 
hiltzikm	706003129490255872	2016-03-05T06:27:17	I'd take it over having my intelligence insulted for an hour. 
hiltzikm	706001976677441537	2016-03-05T06:22:42	We talking chronological or mental?

hiltzikm	693233601240920064	2016-01-30T00:45:44	(4) Nor can poor defer collecting benefits as easily as rich. For some, SS is 50%-90% of ret income.  
hiltzikm	693233147719254016	2016-01-30T00:43:56	(3) But for cohort with the same avg life expectancy, that means fewer years collecting SS benefits.    
hiltzikm	693232918773116928	2016-01-30T00:43:02	(2) Only way to avert the 7% cut is to defer early retirement by same # of years as full retirement date rise;
