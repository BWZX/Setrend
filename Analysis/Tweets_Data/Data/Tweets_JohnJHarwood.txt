JohnJHarwood	710471775126212608	2016-03-17T14:24:05	Paul Ryan on supporting Trump as nominee even while rejecting some of his statements/actions: "I respect the rules"  
JohnJHarwood	710470047081349122	2016-03-17T14:17:13	Slainte, says SpeakerRyan A special St. Paddy's Day speakeasy JohnJHarwood 
JohnJHarwood	710467634626605058	2016-03-17T14:07:38	15) Instead, the "change-nothing" faction has lost control of their own presidential nomination. We’ll see what more there is left to lose.
JohnJHarwood	710466759661363200	2016-03-17T14:04:09	14) The dominant faction on my side of the argument, however, has insisted that it can win all, by changing none.
JohnJHarwood	710466088509767680	2016-03-17T14:01:29	13) I’ve spent a lot of time being dismissed as a RINO squish, or worse, because I think to save most of conservatism, we must change some.
JohnJHarwood	710465571435978752	2016-03-17T13:59:26	12) Yet even as the R elite sees what’s probably coming, it won’t believe it. What worked in 1980 must work again. It just *must*.
JohnJHarwood	710464981708492800	2016-03-17T13:57:06	11) The big clarifying election Ryan yearns for is much more likely to consolidate D control than R control- as he must see.
JohnJHarwood	710464793707200512	2016-03-17T13:56:21	10) But (as Ryan told Harwood), desperately as GOP elites seek an escape, they cannot see it. They will allow themselves to be dragged
JohnJHarwood	710464344136523777	2016-03-17T13:54:34	9) Trump being a candidate whom most Republicans elite regard as a Goldwater-style disaster who will drag whole party to defeat after him
JohnJHarwood	710464091299717120	2016-03-17T13:53:33	8) So as GOP generals stood at Armageddon to battle for the Lord, i.e. Reagan, their troops were deserting to Donald Trump
JohnJHarwood	710463624171622400	2016-03-17T13:51:42	7) The problem was, that the Republican leadership’s version of a right turn - Paul Ryan’s version - was not what the base had in mind
JohnJHarwood	710463173833433089	2016-03-17T13:49:55	6) Result: while Democrats turned to center after their beatings in 80, 84, 88 - Republicans turned further right after 08 &amp; 12.
JohnJHarwood	710462959873597441	2016-03-17T13:49:04	5) While high turnout elections (2008 and 2012) confirmed my assessment, low turnout elections (2010 and 2014) seemed to confirmed theirs
JohnJHarwood	710462548311728129	2016-03-17T13:47:25	4) To put it mildly, few other conservatives shared this view. They saw the same landscape, and saw a country ripe for Reagan-Kemp 2.0
JohnJHarwood	710462313174855680	2016-03-17T13:46:29	3) EG yield on universal healthcare coverage to avert pressure for more radical income redistribution.
JohnJHarwood	710461857316913153	2016-03-17T13:44:41	2) It seemed to me that this was a moment for conservatives to offer timely concessions to mitigate even worse possibilities.
JohnJHarwood	710461523391619072	2016-03-17T13:43:21	1) A personal statement first. It’s been my perception since 2008 that US politics are shifting left, as they shifted right after 1970

JohnJHarwood	708282680270401536	2016-03-11T13:25:24	12) Democrats for Nixon in 1972 became Democrats for Reagan in 1980 … and outright Republicans by 1984.
JohnJHarwood	708282517187473408	2016-03-11T13:24:46	11) Many of the Roosevelt Democrats of 1932- Harold Ickes eg - were people who had bolted the GOP in 1912 and never returned.
JohnJHarwood	708282331103014912	2016-03-11T13:24:01	10) So the “true conservative” independent line it is. The trouble is … that temporary party splits have a way of hardening
JohnJHarwood	708282114593009664	2016-03-11T13:23:10	9) Meaning that the D turnout slide from 08 to 12 can continue into 16 - and still deliver a 1980 style sequence of wins in Senate &amp; states
JohnJHarwood	708281710840942593	2016-03-11T13:21:33	8) And such a turnout collapse will doom Republican down ballot candidates across the country. Goodbye, Senator Portman.
JohnJHarwood	708281540636069889	2016-03-11T13:20:53	7) But rallying around Trump invites a turnout collapse among up-market Republicans, who wont vote D, but cant vote Trump.
JohnJHarwood	708281330300104704	2016-03-11T13:20:03	6) Splitting the party can escalate what might otherwise by a 53-47 Hillary Clinton win into a 53-40-7 Hillary Clinton landslide
JohnJHarwood	708280999814103041	2016-03-11T13:18:44	5) Such a decision presents an agonizing balance of risks to practical Republican politicians
JohnJHarwood	708280592605925377	2016-03-11T13:17:07	4) Rather as liberals repulsed by Jimmy Carter rallied around John Anderson in 1980…
JohnJHarwood	708280424905093120	2016-03-11T13:16:27	3) Anti-Trump GOPers will then have to consider: finding some ballot line for a “true conservative” independent candidacy.
JohnJHarwood	708280016237268994	2016-03-11T13:14:49	2) If that result holds, it’s over not only for Rubio and Cruz - but also almost certainly for plans to halt Trump at convention.
JohnJHarwood	708279704688599040	2016-03-11T13:13:35	1) Post Miami debate (and per RCP polls) Tuesday seems likely to see Trump win Florida (Cruz 3d), and finish 1 or 2 in Ohio (Cruz again 3d)
