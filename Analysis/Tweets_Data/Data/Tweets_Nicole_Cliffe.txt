Nicole_Cliffe	725137926842019840	2016-04-27T01:42:08	By "elderly," I mean this smug bastard is pushing eighty, and I love and hate and fear him and he is my idol.
Nicole_Cliffe	725137687179485188	2016-04-27T01:41:11	They would show up to their first session happily prepared to do horrific things to their body and he would be like "no, not necessary."
Nicole_Cliffe	725137396694556672	2016-04-27T01:40:02	Steve taught the Princeton karate team and constantly had to keep ex-ballet and gymnast women from doing too much. 
Nicole_Cliffe	725137040715575296	2016-04-27T01:38:37	And smile dazzlingly at the losers like me who are sweating their asses off. Then he tosses a towel over his shoulder and walks away.
Nicole_Cliffe	725136773035089920	2016-04-27T01:37:33	There is an elderly ex-gymnast dude at my gym who likes to grab the pull-up bar and do INCREDIBLE shit with it, then say "just a warm-up."
Nicole_Cliffe	725136386337067008	2016-04-27T01:36:01	If you are a Little Girls in Pretty Boxes obsessive, pls read Dmoceanu's memoir. Heartbreaking. 
Nicole_Cliffe	725135918936379392	2016-04-27T01:34:10	FOR THE RECORD do not ever let your kids play football either bc the cumulative head trauma is real. 
Nicole_Cliffe	725134994478264324	2016-04-27T01:30:29	Not to mention, you are not docked points in football for failing to smile winningly while landing on your busted ankle.

Nicole_Cliffe	725133375334289408	2016-04-27T01:24:03	Figure skating is a billion times harder than football, how does anyone get thrown and land twirling on ice? 
Nicole_Cliffe	725130541641519104	2016-04-27T01:12:48	There is an interview with this guy where he was like "I just hoped my mom wasn't watching me bleed to death on TV."

Nicole_Cliffe	725106851675672576	2016-04-26T23:38:39	elielcruz I think Christians sometimes forget that 60% of the Old Testament is people being angry with God (the other 40% being "begats.)

Nicole_Cliffe	724950769179348992	2016-04-26T13:18:26	DearSplenda OF COURSE
Nicole_Cliffe	724949005529030656	2016-04-26T13:11:26	Those were the glory days of blue-collar work, though. My dad stopped doing factory work in like 1983 and still gets a non-trivial pension.
Nicole_Cliffe	724948593811976192	2016-04-26T13:09:48	My dad was a Millennial before his time.
Nicole_Cliffe	724948516548796417	2016-04-26T13:09:29	And he was like "so, you'll pay me like four more cents per hour but I'll have to tell my friends to take fewer smoking breaks? Hard pass."
Nicole_Cliffe	724948288256909312	2016-04-26T13:08:35	Just remembered that when my dad worked at DuPont they offered him a foreman job once.
Nicole_Cliffe	724946474837139456	2016-04-26T13:01:23	Nicole_Cliffe 70% of labor at Chrysler in MI was black but union reps were basically all white. Can't be surprised they felt unrepresented.
Nicole_Cliffe	724945602287640576	2016-04-26T12:57:55	Nicole_Cliffe I've always been really interested in the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement and other Black-led labor organizations.
Nicole_Cliffe	724945153392177152	2016-04-26T12:56:08	(Background reading on race-baiting around historical union actions: )
Nicole_Cliffe	724944867520978944	2016-04-26T12:54:59	MsDeeCM it's great watching patients and carers find ways to express solidarity while still going in
Nicole_Cliffe	724944617892765696	2016-04-26T12:54:00	MsDeeCM oh, I do not think that patients count as crossing lines AT ALL
Nicole_Cliffe	724944239080120321	2016-04-26T12:52:30	For example, black workers crossing picket lines during Chrysler strikes and very much not feeling like unions supported black workers.
Nicole_Cliffe	724944043403137024	2016-04-26T12:51:43	HOWEVER, there is a lot of great history work done on how picket lines have involved hugely racist language and baiting.
Nicole_Cliffe	724942976842121216	2016-04-26T12:47:29	Nicole_Cliffe Canadian, my dad was in mgmt and very anti-union. In high school I had a brief flirtation with communism, so that was fun.
Nicole_Cliffe	724942173402218498	2016-04-26T12:44:17	Nicole_Cliffe My mom was a UAW member in OH, so yes. She also explained the strike to me in Star Wars terms. Gen'l Motors was the Empire.
Nicole_Cliffe	724942203425067008	2016-04-26T12:44:24	ms_peaceweaver Nicole_Cliffe very conservative Calvinism; unions were "unnecessary", greedy, doing something the church should provide
Nicole_Cliffe	724941939766910976	2016-04-26T12:43:21	Nicole_Cliffe and the context for labor unrest there was usually oilfield or refinery work -- where strikes were often for safety regs
Nicole_Cliffe	724942344986845185	2016-04-26T12:44:58	This is a thing too! My fam was way more understanding about scabs than about people crossing lines to shop, etc. 
Nicole_Cliffe	724941206040502272	2016-04-26T12:40:26	I clearly remember them being "yeah, this particular union is ridiculous and this strike is bullshit, but I will kill you if you go in."
Nicole_Cliffe	724940890247188482	2016-04-26T12:39:11	HOW COULD YOU, MR SHEFFIELD 
Nicole_Cliffe	724940745103269888	2016-04-26T12:38:37	Nicole_Cliffe I heard of men who couldn't be elders/deacons in my church if they were members of unions
Nicole_Cliffe	724940746973941760	2016-04-26T12:38:37	oh boy! 
Nicole_Cliffe	724940484305629185	2016-04-26T12:37:34	Nicole_Cliffe my mom has threatened me with "you know Bubbe and Zaide will haunt you!" if I even thought about crossing a picket line.
Nicole_Cliffe	724940591390429185	2016-04-26T12:38:00	(Ella and John are why I'm following the junior doctors' strike so closely, and you should pay attention to them.)

Nicole_Cliffe	724939909170122752	2016-04-26T12:35:17	Nicole_Cliffe Ooh, good example. My uncle quit listening to Mitch Albom's radio show because he crossed the Detroit Free Press picket line.
Nicole_Cliffe	724939998739501057	2016-04-26T12:35:39	this is great 
Nicole_Cliffe	724939780031651840	2016-04-26T12:34:46	Nicole_Cliffe I feel that this is because it's the NHS - public support for strikes isn't usually so unequivocally high
Nicole_Cliffe	724939783160614912	2016-04-26T12:34:47	Nicole_Cliffe YES. I'm American but my mom comes from a long line of Yiddish-speaking Jewish socialists. We do not cross picket lines.
Nicole_Cliffe	724939271799451650	2016-04-26T12:32:45	Nicole_Cliffe I was raised in a union family, so we didn't cross picket lines, honked in support of the picketers.
Nicole_Cliffe	724939273204551681	2016-04-26T12:32:46	Nicole_Cliffe My dad definitely did. He is from a working class/union family. My mom is an immigrant, didn't grow up w/ unions.
Nicole_Cliffe	724939154887479298	2016-04-26T12:32:17	Nicole_Cliffe Definitely a Detroit thing, even though we were never a union family.
Nicole_Cliffe	724939089561149441	2016-04-26T12:32:02	Nicole_Cliffe my dad just found other side jobs because he had to feed his family &amp; couldn't while his work was on strike...
Nicole_Cliffe	724939317471223810	2016-04-26T12:32:56	(I'm thinking about it bc of the junior doctors' strike and how great it is to see patients supporting the strike.)
Nicole_Cliffe	724938734651711488	2016-04-26T12:30:37	I am just curious about whether this is a working class thing or a Canada thing or what, bc I can't even watch that scene in Billy Elliott.
Nicole_Cliffe	724938508805242880	2016-04-26T12:29:43	My parents raised me to think that you NEVER cross a picket line, like that it is an Unbreakable Vow of class solidarity, did your family?
Nicole_Cliffe	724938131175292929	2016-04-26T12:28:13	kateflaim I imagine it would be very complex! I think we would not run a piece by one of the fill-ins, but not bc I think they're wrong.
Nicole_Cliffe	724937023354707968	2016-04-26T12:23:49	Nicole_Cliffe it's very, very nearly unforgivable. 
Nicole_Cliffe	724936929993736192	2016-04-26T12:23:27	Anyway, I'm very very happy for the victims' families, who have worked and pushed and hustled for the inquest and this verdict.
Nicole_Cliffe	724936619879481345	2016-04-26T12:22:13	It's very hard, still, to read the callous, victim-blaming garbage that Boris and Thatcher's press guy spouted about the Hillsborough dead.
Nicole_Cliffe	724936174041714689	2016-04-26T12:20:27	And the physics of how bodies of people move in a crush situation are extremely complex and almost completely involuntary.
Nicole_Cliffe	724935867324862464	2016-04-26T12:19:14	While we're talking about the Hillsborough verdict, people who study crowd disasters avoid the term "stampede" now, bc it implies a choice.

Nicole_Cliffe	723619815047331841	2016-04-22T21:09:42	mariskreizman YOU WERE.
Nicole_Cliffe	723619701662879746	2016-04-22T21:09:15	Nicole_Cliffe I played the Mistress in Evita when I was 15, and I remember feeling betrayed by Madonna when the damn movie came out.
Nicole_Cliffe	723619759401607173	2016-04-22T21:09:29	It is honestly one of Lloyd Webber's best songs, in his best musical, and they dumbed it down for Madonna's range. 
Nicole_Cliffe	723619311034589184	2016-04-22T21:07:42	The IRONY that Peron's dumped teenage mistress even got her FUCKING SOLO stolen from her by Eva. It's an outrage, frankly.
Nicole_Cliffe	723618676025389060	2016-04-22T21:05:11	can you imagine the cruel EVITA viewing party LuPone must have had at her house for all her Broadway buddies 
Nicole_Cliffe	723617841128177664	2016-04-22T21:01:52	In conclusion, I still like the movie a bunch and just wanted to talk about EVITA for a while, and Jane Ohringer's Another Suitcase is A++.
Nicole_Cliffe	723617282396557312	2016-04-22T20:59:38	This, plus the addition of "You Must Love Me" is directly responsible for Movie Eva being way too hamfistedly over-humanized v Broadway Eva.
Nicole_Cliffe	723616280293433344	2016-04-22T20:55:40	I mean, if Patti LuPone didn't insist on stealing the song, and you did, you are the sort of person who will go on to text during Hamilton.
Nicole_Cliffe	723616031097282560	2016-04-22T20:54:40	It doesn't make ANY sense for Eva to sing Another Suitcase, it DIRECTLY contradicts the message of Goodnight &amp; Thank You and her WHOLE DEAL.
Nicole_Cliffe	723615640267808768	2016-04-22T20:53:07	Like, Madonna walked into that movie and was like "I understand there is another woman in this musical and she gets a single song. No."
Nicole_Cliffe	723615494519943168	2016-04-22T20:52:32	I worry a whole generation may never know that "Another Suitcase In Another Hall" is supposed to be sung by Peron's teenage girlfriend.

Nicole_Cliffe	717065822779236353	2016-04-04T19:06:29	I love these pieces by Mary J. Breen about her childhood, they're so fascinating and unfamiliar. 
Nicole_Cliffe	717064071900585984	2016-04-04T18:59:31	polksadots it's DEFINITELY not the point, it's a tremendous look at the complexity of the workers' lives and families and regrets
Nicole_Cliffe	717063848860078080	2016-04-04T18:58:38	aoiph I think most people responding haven't read the piece yet, I imagine that they'll quickly realize why I don't want to recenter.
Nicole_Cliffe	717038885243473921	2016-04-04T17:19:26	This is so depressing.

Nicole_Cliffe	717004049321562112	2016-04-04T15:01:01	There was once another man who behaved inappropriately in public and was called crazy. Do you know that man's name? 
Nicole_Cliffe	717002849415077889	2016-04-04T14:56:15	Just typed "Joe Walsh, of The Eagles, once said..." into the beginning of a piece for Christianity Today, stopped, shook myself, hit delete.
Nicole_Cliffe	717000490911801344	2016-04-04T14:46:52	I am well aware of the irony that I have spent all morning railing against gender norms only to have made sweeping statements about st8 men.
Nicole_Cliffe	716998429541408769	2016-04-04T14:38:41	What straight man gets up early and buys eggs unless it's for a woman, come on. He'd be stuffing dry fistfuls of cereal into his mouth.
Nicole_Cliffe	716997132528406528	2016-04-04T14:33:32	You KNOW he's got a woman in his bed and is making her eggs while she sleeps in, no other explanation possible. 
Nicole_Cliffe	716993560512503808	2016-04-04T14:19:20	Nicole_Cliffe I took over a job for a reporter on leave for 6 months. My next job was, essentially, doing that job at another publication.
Nicole_Cliffe	716993486415904768	2016-04-04T14:19:02	Nicole_Cliffe I've never realized this before: interning at a company with good mat benefits is 100% the foundation of my career
Nicole_Cliffe	716993544779476994	2016-04-04T14:19:16	I hope you have enjoyed Every Year Nicole Is In The US Her Politics Drift Further To The Left Because Things Are Fucked Up As Shit.
Nicole_Cliffe	716993233474027521	2016-04-04T14:18:02	My male Canadian cousins also split parental leave with their wives, and, for the most part, no one batted an eye.
Nicole_Cliffe	716992352754077696	2016-04-04T14:14:32	Which is what happens in every. other. country. in. the. world.
Nicole_Cliffe	716992002496172032	2016-04-04T14:13:09	But when everyone has to do it, that's mitigated a lot. It honestly has to be backed up by the government and jammed down fucking throats.
Nicole_Cliffe	716991491680305152	2016-04-04T14:11:07	Now, does paid parental leave make employers slightly more likely to hire men over young women? It does.
Nicole_Cliffe	716990543201349632	2016-04-04T14:07:21	AND (ding ding ding) when your health care is not based on your job, it makes the logistics of job contracts a billion times easier.
Nicole_Cliffe	716990225034051584	2016-04-04T14:06:05	When the system supports paid parental leave, businesses figure out how to make it work. It creates temp jobs &amp; lets parents back into them.
Nicole_Cliffe	716990010046619648	2016-04-04T14:05:14	YES! So many Canadians building their careers take over someone else's job during their mat leave, then move on. 
Nicole_Cliffe	716988109955530752	2016-04-04T13:57:41	The New Yorker piece is great at the backdrop of domestic labor rights that got us into this situation. 
Nicole_Cliffe	716986641223520256	2016-04-04T13:51:50	We desperately need good subsidized daycare, and to pay caregivers a good wage and make filing grievances simpler and more accessible.
Nicole_Cliffe	716986272519053312	2016-04-04T13:50:22	If moms who stay at home could transition smoothly back into the workforce after a hiatus, that would be great, but it is NOT the reality.
Nicole_Cliffe	716985966586503168	2016-04-04T13:49:10	Childcare is for both parents. And so many moms think of THEIR salary being the one that has to pay for childcare. See also: elder care.
Nicole_Cliffe	716985533214240770	2016-04-04T13:47:26	It's so vital not to think of childcare as something we calculate against a mom's salary and not a dad's salary. 
Nicole_Cliffe	716983621245120512	2016-04-04T13:39:50	From your lips to God's ears mother

Nicole_Cliffe	716971329161793536	2016-04-04T12:51:00	FUNDAMENTALLY though, I honestly do not want to try to recenter a piece about how fucking hard the lives of migrant workers are, it's great.
Nicole_Cliffe	716970399913762816	2016-04-04T12:47:18	I think this is a good, non-judgmental framing, I just bristle a bit that "working Filipino/US dads" aren't factors. 
Nicole_Cliffe	716969518929563651	2016-04-04T12:43:48	And this is a very mild criticism bc the "but gender" thing here is NOT as important as the hard choices driving these Filipina moms abroad.
Nicole_Cliffe	716968931282432001	2016-04-04T12:41:28	I know that women who employ childcare will read this piece &amp; feel like shit in a way that men who read this will not, and it sucks.
Nicole_Cliffe	716968562955460608	2016-04-04T12:40:00	Which is that it's positioned as "US moms work/go to the gym while Filipinas raise their kids" without any idea that US dads also work/gym.
Nicole_Cliffe	716968266380390402	2016-04-04T12:38:49	The New Yorker piece on Filipina domestic workers in the US is really, really good, and I only have one complaint 
Nicole_Cliffe	716965158484979713	2016-04-04T12:26:29	This is basically as good as a 10k word piece on the militarization of police officers in the US. 
Nicole_Cliffe	716756451587461120	2016-04-03T22:37:09	I look forward to seeing what this is supposed to be in the real Dr. Strange film.
