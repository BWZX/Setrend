JayBilas	725670885726756864	2016-04-28T12:59:56	JudgeBobOrr Pretty simple. It's a rules and bylaws issue. Presidents specifically stated NCAA is to be out of course offering, legitimacy.

JayBilas	725168662869643264	2016-04-27T03:44:16	KearneyKodey It is up to each school. Presidents wanted it that way, and wanted NCAA out of areas of course offerings, rigor and the like.
JayBilas	725167647504130048	2016-04-27T03:40:14	UCMAmbrose UNC case is an accreditation issue, not an NCAA issue. NOA makes that pretty clear. NCAA has no idea what to do with this case.

JayBilas	725161552500940801	2016-04-27T03:16:01	dankanenando And, if you wish to "understand me correctly," you can pick up the phone. I am very easy to reach, always have been. Thanks!
JayBilas	725160985707864067	2016-04-27T03:13:46	dankanenando And, all of that is clear from my public statements and timeline, not from a single, out of context tweet on another issue.
JayBilas	725160404574412800	2016-04-27T03:11:27	dankanenando Presidents intentionally kept NCAA, through rules/bylaws, out of course/major/degree legitimacy, rigor. Not NCAA issues.
JayBilas	725159840071450630	2016-04-27T03:09:13	RCCPMD No. To my knowledge, Dan Kane has done some very fine work on this matter. Here, however, he was incorrect, misstated my position.
JayBilas	725159427574222849	2016-04-27T03:07:35	dankanenando Um, not really a "clarification." You completely misstated my position, did not speak to me, took that tweet out of context.

JayBilas	725156092708306944	2016-04-27T02:54:19	MikeSpeBioch That NCAA exceeded its authority in past cases is not justification to break its own rules in this case.
JayBilas	725155781876826112	2016-04-27T02:53:05	UCMAmbrose You, as Presidents, specifically limited NCAA, and told NCAA to stay out of course, major and degree legitimacy. Clear in rules.
JayBilas	725155499042344961	2016-04-27T02:51:58	dankanenando tsnmike Clearly not. The entire discussion was over NCAA rules and bylaws. Your article totally misstated my position.
JayBilas	725154648634613760	2016-04-27T02:48:35	UCMAmbrose No, this is in Presidents' laps. Presidents intentionally made the rules, said NCAA is out of legitimacy of courses, degrees.
JayBilas	725154061725630464	2016-04-27T02:46:15	cobbycobb_UK I didn't say that and, clearly, you didn't listen. I spoke of NCAA rules and bylaws and how they don't address this issue.
JayBilas	725153861095284741	2016-04-27T02:45:27	cobbycobb_UK It's NCAA rules and bylaws. You are stating what should happen, irrespective of rules. I am telling you what rules allow.
JayBilas	725153512741543936	2016-04-27T02:44:04	dankanenando No biggie, but you totally misstated my position. Tweet in response to tsnmike asserting easy courses exist at every school.

JayBilas	725149106943983617	2016-04-27T02:26:34	cobbycobb_UK It's clear. I am saying only that NCAA rules and bylaws do not cover it. And, Notice of Allegations confirms that judgment.
JayBilas	725072704487968773	2016-04-26T21:22:58	TheRealPest Stop. That a few act inappropriately doesn't make the enterprise fraudulent. This has happened before and you were silent.

JayBilas	725068546334724096	2016-04-26T21:06:27	pushermanRL Implied powers don't cover this, either. This is specifically and intentionally left to schools. NCAA told to stay out of it.
JayBilas	725068168885112834	2016-04-26T21:04:57	pushermanRL It ain't lawyers or money. It's NCAA Presidents and NCAA rules only. NCAA would have to violate its own rules to address this.
JayBilas	725067832862593024	2016-04-26T21:03:37	pushermanRL Perhaps you should send a strongly worded letter to NCAA to change rules. It's current rules and bylaws don't cover this issue.
JayBilas	725067368318296068	2016-04-26T21:01:46	pushermanRL Those issues are covered by rules. The UNC issue is specifically and intentionally not covered by NCAA rules.
JayBilas	725067126982193152	2016-04-26T21:00:48	pushermanRL Look, I don't write the rules. But, I have read them, and NCAA rules don't cover this! You can argue, but I'm right on this.
JayBilas	725066714774425601	2016-04-26T20:59:10	pushermanRL Under rules and bylaws, yes. There is a rule change now that makes such things an extra benefit (which is silly). Not prior.
JayBilas	725066380836483073	2016-04-26T20:57:50	pushermanRL The McAdoo issue was handled and adjudicated years ago. This is a different matter.
JayBilas	725066095296675842	2016-04-26T20:56:42	Blue_Mist He should have been corrected on that long before this. This has happened before. You just didn't pay attention to it.
JayBilas	725065753674833921	2016-04-26T20:55:21	pushermanRL Yes. NCAA intentionally keeps out of course, major, degree legitimacy. NCAA rules don't cover this issue. Period.
JayBilas	725065488041185280	2016-04-26T20:54:18	pushermanRL Yes, it IS different under NCAA rules and bylaws.
JayBilas	725065342419095553	2016-04-26T20:53:43	pushermanRL It's not my position. It's the NCAA's rules and bylaws. They intentionally don't cover the UNC case. Presidents made it so.
JayBilas	725057144203124736	2016-04-26T20:21:08	Blue_Mist Not sure that's true. NCAA is screwed up, but not that screwed up.

JayBilas	725056758843101185	2016-04-26T20:19:36	kenogirl98 Awesome, isn't it?!
JayBilas	725056634389680129	2016-04-26T20:19:07	Blue_Mist It was meaningless before and after. APR is a meaningless measure.
JayBilas	725056375458521090	2016-04-26T20:18:05	pushermanRL Different. One is players cheating the academic department, the other is the legitimacy of courses. Latter not an NCAA issue.
JayBilas	725055793662402560	2016-04-26T20:15:46	pushermanRL It was taught by basketball office personnel. I don't recall sanctions from that class, but that's the substantive difference.
JayBilas	724989135828586496	2016-04-26T15:50:54	markabarger Not so. SACS can handle this in due course. That's its lane, not NCAA's (by NCAA's intentional choice).
JayBilas	724988808760950785	2016-04-26T15:49:36	heel901 It's not just his statement, it was a lack of corroboration. No supporting evidence.
JayBilas	724975941118791680	2016-04-26T14:58:28	remarkneb No. Too many take the stance of how it should be instead of how it is. NCAA rules can be mind-numbing.
JayBilas	724975681428443137	2016-04-26T14:57:26	MainStreetMuse tsnmike Nobody argues UNC wasn't wrong. Why don't you quote applicable passages of NCAA rules and bylaws? You can't.
JayBilas	724975254184013824	2016-04-26T14:55:44	MainStreetMuse tsnmike Perhaps, but that would require major rule changes. Under current rules, NCAA cannot do that in a case like UNC.

JayBilas	724974658588696576	2016-04-26T14:53:22	NCCyberAdvocate MainStreetMuse Key point. Even if questionable classes were backed out of their GPAs, doesn't mean players ineligible.
JayBilas	724974203804483585	2016-04-26T14:51:34	MikeSpeBioch markcstory SU was an NCAA overreach, but violations of rules by player, staff. Here, issue was legitimacy of courses offered.
JayBilas	724973698235650049	2016-04-26T14:49:33	MainStreetMuse tsnmike Not the issue. NCAA rules do not address legitimacy of courses, majors or degrees. NCAA has nowhere to go on this.
JayBilas	724973487492845569	2016-04-26T14:48:43	remarkneb Not everyone grasps that point. They scream "rules, rules, rules" and then want to avoid the rules in adjudication process.
JayBilas	724967095864315904	2016-04-26T14:23:19	MikeSpeBioch markcstory Entire NCAA adjudication process is horribly flawed, has been forever. But, UNC is about the rules themselves.
JayBilas	724966637015846917	2016-04-26T14:21:30	wildcat_mike_57 MikeSpeBioch markcstory NCAA would have to break its own rules to do as you ask. Rules based organization cannot do that.
JayBilas	724966255938166786	2016-04-26T14:19:59	remarkneb Given NCAA rhetoric, questions understandable. But, NCAA rules don't contemplate UNC. NCAA has to make it up, as with Penn State.
JayBilas	724965618554953728	2016-04-26T14:17:27	MainStreetMuse NCCyberAdvocate pushermanRL It's pretty simple. NCAA rules don't contemplate legitimacy of courses offered.

JayBilas	724760989464428545	2016-04-26T00:44:19	MainStreetMuse Actually, the comparison is good. SACS deals with course and degree offerings and rigor. NCAA intentionally does not.
JayBilas	724760621078732801	2016-04-26T00:42:52	MainStreetMuse Read the NOI. Boxill worked from the WBB office, evidence of complicity on her part. Such evidence NOT present elsewhere.
JayBilas	724760029711179777	2016-04-26T00:40:31	heel9091 Please. There is zero evidence Roy Williams had knowledge or was complicit. Wainstein Report found otherwise.
JayBilas	724752532812255233	2016-04-26T00:10:43	MainStreetMuse Those are separate issues. NCAA rules do not cover course/degree offerings or rigor, intentionally left to each school.
JayBilas	724752167836504066	2016-04-26T00:09:16	droinclay Agreed NCAA mistreated Boeheim for violations. But, mistreating one does not call for mistreatment of another w/o violations.
JayBilas	724751687131533312	2016-04-26T00:07:22	MainStreetMuse It's not an NCAA matter. That's an issue of course offering, rigor. NCAA rules do not address such issues, intentionally.

JayBilas	724748417616982016	2016-04-25T23:54:22	gregDOTwright tsnmike No, it's not about courses. Allegation on WBB about involvement of office personnel.
JayBilas	724748085998575616	2016-04-25T23:53:03	ShuckeyDucky KyleEads Yell all you like. NCAA was wrong to sanction Rose, but rules addressed the issue. In UNC case, no rules address it.
JayBilas	724742851121319936	2016-04-25T23:32:15	markousley No evidence that those offices were complicit. This was an academic department, not an tale tic program.
JayBilas	724742165008625664	2016-04-25T23:29:31	Kevin_C_Parker There have been severe consequences. This is not an NCAA issue, intentionally left to the schools. Accreditation issue.
JayBilas	724741713915424773	2016-04-25T23:27:44	gregDOTwright tsnmike Nah, that's absurd. Transcripts show nothing to prove or disprove such claims. All investigations had transcripts.
JayBilas	724731887621648384	2016-04-25T22:48:41	KyleEads Presidents do. NCAA rules specifically and intentionally leave courses, degrees and rigor up to schools. Accreditation issue.
JayBilas	724731051566862336	2016-04-25T22:45:22	gregDOTwright tsnmike No evidence to back up such claims, clearly. UNC was investigated five times, including by Kenneth Wainstein.
JayBilas	724730642660003840	2016-04-25T22:43:44	markousley Lack of institutional control is alleged. However, NCAA has never sanctioned a sport not specifically charged in the NOA.
JayBilas	724730021760405505	2016-04-25T22:41:16	gregDOTwright tsnmike Incorrect. This was investigated five times. If NCAA could allege that, it certainly would have.
JayBilas	724729633971822592	2016-04-25T22:39:44	AuburnHope Different issue. That was specific to players. Only alleged to potentially be ineligible here may be in Women's Basketball.
JayBilas	724729176750710786	2016-04-25T22:37:55	KyleEads Perhaps nothing. But, NCAA has specific rules for that, however silly. NCAA intentionally has no rules to address UNC issues.
JayBilas	724707607588511744	2016-04-25T21:12:12	tsnmike droinclay MikeWatersSYR I agree on NCAA mistreating Boeheim. However, NCAA has no rules/bylaws addressing UNC. Different cases.
JayBilas	724706987150336001	2016-04-25T21:09:44	TBCuse11 Cuse and SMU were mistreated. Not clear UNC won't be similarly mistreated, but cases are far different. UNC not an NCAA issue.
JayBilas	724706630353473537	2016-04-25T21:08:19	BobbyJHoskins You're wrong. Not one athlete is alleged to have been ineligible in the Notice of Allegations. Not an NCAA issue.
JayBilas	724706296482652160	2016-04-25T21:07:00	TJFL34 The Jenkins case is the one to watch there. A record will be built on that issue. O'Bannon case was name and likeness only.

JayBilas	724693053332561920	2016-04-25T20:14:22	tsnmike jbohanis Easy and fraudulent are different. The UNC matter is an accreditation issue, not an NCAA issue.
JayBilas	724692682262601733	2016-04-25T20:12:54	jbohanis tsnmike Doubtful. But, NCAA rules don't cover such issues.
JayBilas	724692286127349760	2016-04-25T20:11:19	bambam1729 sdutzeigler They should, but won't. Kind of like insisting everyone get a pre-nup prior to marriage. Downside not considered.
JayBilas	724691913773867009	2016-04-25T20:09:51	smyzo AndrewWHogan tsnmike Different issue. Although questionable (and incorrectly applied), NCAA rules had Rose initially ineligible.
JayBilas	724691367411240960	2016-04-25T20:07:40	jbohanis tsnmike No, NCAA bylaws intentionally leave legitimacy, rigor of courses, majors, degrees to each school. No rules for this.
JayBilas	724687902920323074	2016-04-25T19:53:54	tsnmike NCAA had no leg to stand on with extra benefit claim, and knew it. They were making it up as they went along. See, Michigan 2008.
JayBilas	724687227314384898	2016-04-25T19:51:13	achaps3 Not so. NCAA does all of this with eyes open. If EMU is mismanaged, wants to quit, fine. Not the case with all others.
JayBilas	724686900993376259	2016-04-25T19:49:55	TJFL34 Yes, actually, it is. The Ninth Circuit ruled NCAA violated antitrust law. The Jenkins case is coming next.
JayBilas	724686582721163265	2016-04-25T19:48:40	covvb0y Not true. You have no basis for that assertion, and it's not a legit justification to limit all, industry wide.
JayBilas	724653728347881472	2016-04-25T17:38:06	Washington State's insistence at blocking the potential transfer of a grad student to SDSU is petty and flat wrong. 
JayBilas	724606532177022977	2016-04-25T14:30:34	andyhre Agree. But, quality leadership would eliminate cartel behavior within the structure. It's not that difficult.

JayBilas	724370042884907009	2016-04-24T22:50:51	mynamedustin No, it's not pay. It's expenses only. NCAA admits as much, and admits it is a cartel.
JayBilas	724243199523475457	2016-04-24T14:26:49	covvb0y If it's amateur, how do you justify selling amateurs for billions, paying millions in salaries to coaches, billions on facilities?
JayBilas	724240061093564416	2016-04-24T14:14:20	azwildcat_7377 Nope. The school has no say. Only athletes are restricted in this fashion.
JayBilas	724239622306447362	2016-04-24T14:12:36	azwildcat_7377 I think they care. But, amateurism doesn't make them care more, nor would pay make them care less.
JayBilas	724237613067022336	2016-04-24T14:04:37	covvb0y No, if your school chooses not to pay, fine. An industry wide wage cap on athletes only is immoral.
JayBilas	724237351350837248	2016-04-24T14:03:34	covvb0y There is no amateur game. It's sold for billions of dollars annually. It's ludicrous to call it amateur.
JayBilas	724199513959833600	2016-04-24T11:33:13	HighEliteMajor LOI is not at issue. Cap on compensation is. Simply stating LOI exists does not justify this collusive Rube Goldberg system.

JayBilas	724094457344307200	2016-04-24T04:35:46	howardroark83 No, I'm not. Tuition is not taxed according to IRS. Still, you obfuscate. Tax is no reason not to pay. It's absurd.
JayBilas	724094158961516545	2016-04-24T04:34:35	howardroark83 Work study is different. Most schools employ students in several capacities outside of work study programs.
JayBilas	724093728823074816	2016-04-24T04:32:52	HighEliteMajor No, it's not. Every reasonable economist agrees. And, two different federal courts have ruled NCAA violated antitrust law.
JayBilas	723984985057800193	2016-04-23T21:20:46	HighEliteMajor Not if there is collusion among market competitors to fix wages, Adele have with NCAA.
JayBilas	723972204405358592	2016-04-23T20:29:58	HighEliteMajor Odd how LOI is considered a contract, yet schools "tamper" with coaches under binding contract at member schools. Hypocrisy?
JayBilas	723971657593925634	2016-04-23T20:27:48	howardroark83 And, no state employment law prohibits student-employees. Happens all the time.
JayBilas	723971465201233921	2016-04-23T20:27:02	howardroark83 No, they don't. IRS has ruled scholarships non-taxable, no case has been dismissed upon Title IX grounds. Rationalizations.
JayBilas	723971006428225537	2016-04-23T20:25:13	howardroark83 No such laws limit the compensation of one class of person, industry wide.
JayBilas	723970767378100224	2016-04-23T20:24:16	howardroark83 Laughable. The entire argument is about athlete compensation. NCAA has been found to violate federal antitrust laws.
JayBilas	723947028804448256	2016-04-23T18:49:56	JohnDavidHarman Nonsense. Spending magically rises with revenues, and jobs are added at an alarming rate. Read Dan Wetzel's latest article.
JayBilas	723944843962114048	2016-04-23T18:41:15	howardroark83 No, it's based upon law and fairness. I advocate change, which is coming. Respectfully, your arguments are nonsensical.
JayBilas	723944353664786432	2016-04-23T18:39:18	andyhre howardroark83 Bingo. Funny how facts and law are ignored when arguing athletes only should be unpaid.
JayBilas	723944047799336960	2016-04-23T18:38:05	howardroark83 So, when you have no argument, you channel Cervantes? The Quixotic view is yours.
JayBilas	723943203452366849	2016-04-23T18:34:44	JohnDavidHarman That's hardly the point. Do you think assistant coaches make tons of money now, but players wouldn't? Nonsense.
JayBilas	723928909029490688	2016-04-23T17:37:56	JohnDavidHarman Funny how those selling the players for billions don't have to be careful what they wish for. Only those unpaid do. Silly.
JayBilas	723928158769127424	2016-04-23T17:34:57	JohnDavidHarman So? We're doing this to dodge taxes? How lame. Coaches seem to bank those money and pay taxes, too.
JayBilas	723919867783602178	2016-04-23T17:02:00	howardroark83 By your logic, schools "abdicate responsibility" with regard to every other person, including every other student. How silly.
JayBilas	723919393089048576	2016-04-23T17:00:07	howardroark83 Actually, it's for individual schools to take responsibility as with every other decision on whether to pay and how much.
JayBilas	723919102570586112	2016-04-23T16:58:58	howardroark83 So, by virtue of that logic, NCAA can limit pay of coaches and any other employee because they can work in another industry?
JayBilas	723918696213831680	2016-04-23T16:57:21	howardroark83 No. All NCAA schools collude to limit athletes alone with a wage ceiling that no individual entity in the market can violate.
JayBilas	723917939427172353	2016-04-23T16:54:21	ga_mck In this case, actually, it does. This is not a matter of opinion, but of objective fact. Ask any economist.
JayBilas	723917663454502912	2016-04-23T16:53:15	ga_mck No, that's silly. There is no real choice involved. It's a collusive wage ceiling, industry wide. No other person limited to that.
JayBilas	723916970740035585	2016-04-23T16:50:30	JohnDavidHarman Instead of colluding to limit wages, why isn't the choice to each school as to whether to pay and how much?
JayBilas	723916663788326912	2016-04-23T16:49:17	JohnDavidHarman The industry or not is not choice. Choice is competition within the industry.
JayBilas	723916446565306368	2016-04-23T16:48:25	howardroark83 The industry or not is not choice. Choice is competition within the industry. You're taking a narrow stance.

JayBilas	723898981076598784	2016-04-23T15:39:01	PoppaJET Nonsense. Tampering doesn't exist. But, if WSU has evidence, bring it forward. Don't smear the player and SDSU. How lame.
JayBilas	723898567354646528	2016-04-23T15:37:22	ga_mck Please. Athletes are limited to only that. And, it's not some benevolent gift. Those things are to maximize performance, make money.
JayBilas	723893365180403712	2016-04-23T15:16:42	howardroark83 Nonsense. NCAA doesn't allow entities to compete in the industry, it restrict athletes only, industry wide. No such choice.

JayBilas	723887883191500800	2016-04-23T14:54:55	HighEliteMajor That's not a true contract. It binds only one party, and provides no real consideration to the player. Contract of adhesion.

JayBilas	723859393473863681	2016-04-23T13:01:42	ga_mck Those are not facts. The fact is, billions are generated. That some can't compete is no reason for all to be limited to zero. Silly.

JayBilas	723605689545953282	2016-04-22T20:13:34	JasonMKates It says "usually." But, whether HS pays or not is irrelevant to NCAA, which is pro sports in every way NOW.

JayBilas	723126111597637632	2016-04-21T12:27:54	JbarryBrd I have thought it through. Each school can decide what to pay. These schools have thousands of employees. Not difficult.

JayBilas	718251099375943681	2016-04-08T01:36:21	GallopM If your view were true, there'd be no need to restrict athletes to expenses only. Athletes would command far more.
JayBilas	718250810161950720	2016-04-08T01:35:12	GallopM Silly argument. You could say the same thing about coaches. Their value is reflected in their pay. Same for athletes.
JayBilas	718246452229718016	2016-04-08T01:17:53	GallopM You're wrong. That other students generally aren't worth as much isn't the issue. They can earn their value. Athletes can't.
JayBilas	718239970130051073	2016-04-08T00:52:07	GallopM No. Backwards. All other students allowed to earn their fair market value in any chosen field. Only athletes are limited in pay!
JayBilas	718233731086032896	2016-04-08T00:27:20	GallopM Athletes DO earn it, and far more. In fact, athletes are the only ones, including all other students, that are limited in pay.

JayBilas	718232173707403267	2016-04-08T00:21:08	GallopM So? What does that have to do with pay? Nothing. (Thank you for your service!) a Not a legit justification to limit athletes.
JayBilas	718229621003718656	2016-04-08T00:11:00	GallopM You'll never agree? Sounds like a closed mind. Whom else do you argue should be unpaid? Anyone?

JayBilas	718227732799320064	2016-04-08T00:03:30	GallopM There is financial aid available, a myriad of ways to pay for college. It is not up to athletes only to sacrifice pay for others.
JayBilas	718227340002750466	2016-04-08T00:01:56	GallopM Not the issue! Athletes worth far more than a scholarship! If it's such a great deal, let it stand on its own in the marketplace.
JayBilas	718226967737298950	2016-04-08T00:00:27	GlenLanham Not so. There are more Olympic sports now than ever. And, more Women's sports.
JayBilas	718226638308315136	2016-04-07T23:59:09	GallopM Of course he could. I hope you aren't implying he is somehow unqualified or not intelligent enough to attend college. That's wrong.
JayBilas	718225760964775936	2016-04-07T23:55:40	GallopM Misdirection arguments. You don't argue any other person in any other industry should be unpaid. No legit reason to limit athletes.
JayBilas	718225255685308417	2016-04-07T23:53:39	GallopM Please. If college sports did not exist, where would coaches and administrators be? Not a legit reason to limit athletes only.
JayBilas	718224916273885185	2016-04-07T23:52:18	GallopM Read this:  Ridiculous to assert non-revenue athletes would not go to college if athletes paid.
JayBilas	718224382552895492	2016-04-07T23:50:11	GallopM No, they don't. Majority would go anyway. Athletes not required to remain unpaid to allow others to go to college. Phony argument.
JayBilas	718223906197389313	2016-04-07T23:48:17	GallopM You didn't answer mine. Whom else do you argue should be unpaid, industry wide, in a multi-billion dollar business? Anyone?
JayBilas	718223653234688005	2016-04-07T23:47:17	GallopM Not as well as if I were paid fair market value. That I did well is not reason to limit all to expenses only. How do coaches do?
JayBilas	718223267631378433	2016-04-07T23:45:45	GallopM Simply not true. If it were, coaches and administrators would be limited, too. They're not. Why are athletes only sacrificing?
JayBilas	718222865682837506	2016-04-07T23:44:09	GallopM Another phony argument. Nobody said worth nothing. But, worth far less than athlete's value. A scholarship is a collusive cap.
JayBilas	718222342091104257	2016-04-07T23:42:04	GallopM Yes...IMMORAL. Making billions off of athletes while limiting them, and only them, industry wide is profoundly immoral.
JayBilas	718222040965242880	2016-04-07T23:40:53	GallopM Phony issue. There's no reason to limit athletes only, especially when no other person, including no other student, is limited.
JayBilas	718221572918677504	2016-04-07T23:39:01	GallopM No, it's correct. When you profit off of others while at the same time limiting those others from profit, you exploit. Period.

JayBilas	718218510707458048	2016-04-07T23:26:51	GallopM To whom else do you say, "you will be limited to expenses only in a multi-billion dollar business, or join the Army"?! How silly.
JayBilas	718218170784321537	2016-04-07T23:25:30	GallopM That's fine, if a person decides to accept that. But, NCAA collision to limit all to only that is wrong to the point of immoral.

JayBilas	718189321098907648	2016-04-07T21:30:52	ChisHansen They are not akin to interns. There is no industry wide limit on what interns can make. Actually, law says interns must be paid.

JayBilas	718137116182450176	2016-04-07T18:03:25	UkDorton No. That's based upon demand. Funny how that question isn't asked when coaches make millions.
JayBilas	718136919993901056	2016-04-07T18:02:38	GlenLanham No, it's not. That's just doomsday nonsense. Funny, you don't say that regarding facilities spending or coaches salaries. Lame.
JayBilas	718124872803553281	2016-04-07T17:14:46	GlenLanham There are more sports now than ever. If Tulsa valued golf, Tulsa would have golf. That was a choice.

JayBilas	718098068646850561	2016-04-07T15:28:15	jimbednar22 Ha! Not at you, at the argument. It's absurd to suggest paying athletes is too complicated when we pay everyone else.

JayBilas	718092627686662144	2016-04-07T15:06:38	ChisHansen No, they are not interns. Interns are not sold for billions and subject to a collusive, industry wide wage ceiling.

JayBilas	718090499610058756	2016-04-07T14:58:11	GallopM Not so. There is no real choice because entire industry collides to limit athletes only while exploiting them for financial gain.
JayBilas	718089580981919744	2016-04-07T14:54:32	dnigro01 Yes. Old Big East disbanded, shut down as an entity. A new entity formed, and was gifted the old name. New Big East is terrific.

JayBilas	717781203340775424	2016-04-06T18:29:09	SriramofNorwell GallopM It's actually NOT payment. It is an expense incidental to a multi-billion dollar industry, and NCAA agrees.

JayBilas	716034704210665472	2016-04-01T22:49:11	sbaglini55 That's up to each school. Just as with coaches, other employees. Pretty simple.
JayBilas	716031358502510593	2016-04-01T22:35:53	sbaglini55 It's not complicated to pay fair market value. They know what players are worth. These are excuses.
JayBilas	716031091115560960	2016-04-01T22:34:49	john4ku No. Easy to hold accountable those actually responsible. License all, pull licenses of the guilty, stop punishing the blameless.
JayBilas	716030730606804992	2016-04-01T22:33:24	walty12 Absurd. NCAA entities compete in free market for coaches and employees, yet same lame argument applies as to another industry.
JayBilas	716030187364700160	2016-04-01T22:31:14	walty12 They already did. It's called the NCAA.
JayBilas	716029955239325696	2016-04-01T22:30:19	john4ku No, just a made-up construct to blame and shame one person, so administrators can avoid accountability. Rules they wouldn't accept.

JayBilas	716011079562702848	2016-04-01T21:15:18	dclucas Ridiculous. How do they know whom to recruit? Whom to play? What to pay coaches and secretaries? So complicated! Let's fold it up!

JayBilas	716010119192907777	2016-04-01T21:11:29	john4ku Like when NCAA office unethically abused federal bankruptcy process in Miami case? Emmert skated, only responsible parties blamed.
JayBilas	716009535782002688	2016-04-01T21:09:10	sbaglini55 How do they decide what to pay everyone else? Each school can make those decisions for itself. Hardly complicated. Simple.
JayBilas	716009216297676800	2016-04-01T21:07:54	coachcjames No. Some rules were violated off campus. Hardly systemic nor widespread. NCAA relies upon uneducated shaming of its programs.
JayBilas	716008710967922689	2016-04-01T21:05:54	PaytDogg No, sports do that. Lessons from sport are just as profound before and after college. Nothing magical about college.
JayBilas	716008010905092096	2016-04-01T21:03:07	dcoker275 So do the simple minded, moralizing without knowing the issues.
JayBilas	716007748077428737	2016-04-01T21:02:04	sbaglini55 Look up the word hypocrisy. It's those making money off of those they restrict from making money. I'm advocating change.

JayBilas	716007384313831424	2016-04-01T21:00:37	john4ku You hold those that actually did wrong responsible, not those that had nothing to do with it. Pretty simple.
JayBilas	716007152989507585	2016-04-01T20:59:42	coachcjames Yes, actually, it is. Most moralizing about Boeheim have no idea what issues were, and how disproportionate the sanctions.

JayBilas	715693945112559617	2016-04-01T00:15:08	ukcats75 No, it's not. It's the NCAA bylaws. A rules organization has to follow its own rules. See the Michigan case, 2008.

JayBilas	715671508312395776	2016-03-31T22:45:58	MrJacobDavis No. You are not subject to a unilateral wage restriction, industry wide. You CAN make as much as CEO, Jones. Athletes cannot.

JayBilas	715664942846726145	2016-03-31T22:19:53	JonSolomonCBS Upon my reading, it was one player, one paper. NCAA ruled Boeheim had no knowledge. Hardly systemic academic fraud, was it?
JayBilas	715646910946611201	2016-03-31T21:08:14	RogerPielkeJr If scholarships are pay, it is inescapable that such "pay" is capped by collusive wage ceiling violative of antitrust law.

JayBilas	715569084717359104	2016-03-31T15:58:59	CoachTGorrell So, by that logic, colleges can collude to limit coaches' pay because coaches can "choose" to leave the country? Nonsense.
JayBilas	715568623251632128	2016-03-31T15:57:09	CoachTGorrell A false choice. Choice is not the industry or leave the country. It's competitive offers within the industry.

JayBilas	715547593929940993	2016-03-31T14:33:35	McquillenAj I believe it is an antitrust violation. O'Bannon court ruled NCAA violated antitrust law, Kessler will pursue that, as well.
JayBilas	715547134699778049	2016-03-31T14:31:45	TU_BLA That doesn't matter. No matter how long players stay, they deserve to receive fair market value in college. It's a distinct market.
JayBilas	715546645077712897	2016-03-31T14:29:49	TU_BLA That's entirely the point. Amateurism is a sham. It's a collusive, industry wide wage ceiling. It's wrong to the point of immoral.
JayBilas	715546300855373826	2016-03-31T14:28:26	TU_BLA No, there are not. Without talent, there is no big money. That's why they recruit. And, why they pay coaches millions upon millions.
JayBilas	715545991118610437	2016-03-31T14:27:13	McquillenAj Nobody said crime but you. NCAA acts like this is all some benevolent gift. It's not. It's big business.
JayBilas	715543904716599296	2016-03-31T14:18:55	UCMAmbrose If it's so valuable, let the deal stand on its own in the marketplace. You know athletes are worth far more than a scholarship.
JayBilas	715543555205300225	2016-03-31T14:17:32	UCMAmbrose Nonsense. Education and pay are not mutually exclusive. Why don't all colleges limit all those on academic scholarship, too?
JayBilas	715542630239588353	2016-03-31T14:13:51	Economist Andy Schwarz deconstructs nonsensical arguments distracting all from collusion limiting college athletes. 
JayBilas	715529156931428353	2016-03-31T13:20:19	UCMAmbrose Those on academic scholarship have that AND are allowed fair market value in a chosen field. Why the difference? Unjustifiable.
JayBilas	715528283090104320	2016-03-31T13:16:51	dailycollegebal I hear the sarcasm. It is unjustifiable given the commercialization of the industry. It's pro sports. Undeniable.
JayBilas	715504298977677312	2016-03-31T11:41:32	markschlereth SethOnHoops Pride? That ship sailed a long time ago...
JayBilas	715504049118781440	2016-03-31T11:40:33	JohnDavidHarman Nonsense. They spend. And, no other person is limited in pay based upon overall profit.
JayBilas	715503833447669760	2016-03-31T11:39:41	JohnDavidHarman Not so. No case has been dismissed or decided upon Title IX grounds.
JayBilas	715503194969755648	2016-03-31T11:37:09	Looking forward to this week, covering the Final Four in Houston with SethOnHoops (pictured).

JayBilas	715338337221914624	2016-03-31T00:42:04	coryok03 They are. In this industry and markets of college sports, conditions are unilaterally imposed upon the athletes.
JayBilas	715337962444042240	2016-03-31T00:40:35	KillDaWabbit2 Issue is to let athletes compete for such resources along with everyone else. Hardly unheard of. Happens in every industry.
JayBilas	715337722223656960	2016-03-31T00:39:37	KillDaWabbit2 The pie keeps growing. By that logic, no pay raises for anyone would ever happen. Resources always allocated to priorities.
JayBilas	715337381436456960	2016-03-31T00:38:16	KillDaWabbit2 Yes, it does. Over the years, billions were generated.
JayBilas	715337219876081664	2016-03-31T00:37:38	KillDaWabbit2 It wasn't what it is now. It is undisputed that basketball advanced the institution to greater heights. All there admit it.
JayBilas	715336790383599616	2016-03-31T00:35:55	MatthewGaylor No, I don't feel a 50-50 split of billions in revenues agreed to by players is exploitation. College athletes are exploited.
JayBilas	715336341597257728	2016-03-31T00:34:08	KillDaWabbit2 Silly. If that were true, spending and salaries would reflect those priorities. They don't.
JayBilas	715336059031171072	2016-03-31T00:33:01	KillDaWabbit2 No, it would be a lesser institution. That is not debatable. Billions made off of athletics, advanced the institution. Clear.
JayBilas	715335681032097792	2016-03-31T00:31:31	MatthewGaylor Reaching. Implying college athletes get nothing because NBA bargains a salary cap giving NBA players billions is absurd.
JayBilas	715335166885908480	2016-03-31T00:29:28	off_TWal They are not prohibited from that and more! Those students can earn or accept exactly what they're worth.
JayBilas	715334790782685186	2016-03-31T00:27:59	molibra No, there is no legit other side. Debt is irrelevant. Students on academic scholarship have no debt, yet they can earn fair value.
JayBilas	715334477396901888	2016-03-31T00:26:44	off_TWal They are allowed payment, yes. Any non-athlete student can be paid and accept fair market value. Pretty simple to understand.
JayBilas	715334200719572992	2016-03-31T00:25:38	MatthewGaylor It's free market, subject to labor laws. You're reaching. NBA players get billions, half of basketball related revenues.
JayBilas	715333799823876096	2016-03-31T00:24:02	off_TWal A hardworking academic student can receive fair market value, without restriction. Those students can be paid what they're worth.
JayBilas	715333475696390144	2016-03-31T00:22:45	Harvey_the_Blue I don't think wins can be vacated. No athlete alleged ineligible. All grades posted, degrees conferred. Not an NCAA issue.
JayBilas	715331854929240064	2016-03-31T00:16:19	MatthewGaylor It is free market. Players agree to be in union, and union and NBA agree to terms. College players have no say whatsoever.
JayBilas	715331260663508993	2016-03-31T00:13:57	msubones No, pro teams exhibit the same values of teamwork and sacrifice, and college teams show the same selfishness and jealousy.
JayBilas	715330969289396224	2016-03-31T00:12:47	McquillenAj NCAA has no similar restrictions on anyone or anything else. Only athletes are restricted, industry wide.
JayBilas	715330442287652864	2016-03-31T00:10:42	MatthewGaylor Therefore. It is the free market. College athletes have a wage cieling unilaterally imposed.
JayBilas	715330070844297216	2016-03-31T00:09:13	MatthewGaylor NBA players collectively bargain with the league under labor law, and agree to the cap. NBA players get 50% of revenues!
JayBilas	715329598578294788	2016-03-31T00:07:21	McquillenAj It's an antitrust violation to band together and agree that nobody can pay them. It should be up to each entity.
JayBilas	715329242142126080	2016-03-31T00:05:56	msubones Like with pro teams? Those pro teams that exhibit the same teamwork and sacrifice as amateur teams? Phony argument.
JayBilas	715328935215562752	2016-03-31T00:04:42	McquillenAj Internships are not required to be unpaid or limited, industry wide. Each entity determines what to pay to compete in market.
JayBilas	715328544193126401	2016-03-31T00:03:09	MrJacobDavis Not true. There is no industry wide limit as to what associates can be paid. Each firm determines what it will pay to compete.
JayBilas	715328002867892224	2016-03-31T00:01:00	McquillenAj It is forced upon players, who have no say. It is unilaterally imposed.
JayBilas	715327799276363777	2016-03-31T00:00:12	aarmruster Nonsense. Players have coveted talent and names prior. Schools sure know whom to recruit in order to win.
JayBilas	715327242583220224	2016-03-30T23:57:59	MatthewGaylor Good Q. Salary cap collectively bargained between players and NBA. Players get 50% of revenue. Players and NBA agree to it.
JayBilas	715326684136800256	2016-03-30T23:55:46	MrJacobDavis No. When you use athletes to make money while at the same time restricting those athletes from making money, you exploit them.
JayBilas	715326196578455552	2016-03-30T23:53:50	Sp3chtacle So, anyone fulfilling a dream and pursuing education should remain unpaid? That would be all students. Or, just athletes? Silly.
JayBilas	715325727483166720	2016-03-30T23:51:58	roughlyandrew I did. Equally absurd. Whom else in our society do these people argue should remain unpaid? Only athletes? Laughable.
JayBilas	715325268294959105	2016-03-30T23:50:08	srventures Not so. You could make the same, lame argument regarding coaches. Athletes have great value beyond a scholarship.
JayBilas	715324968515424257	2016-03-30T23:48:57	MichaelEHuck NLRB has ruled Northwestern football players employees. They have all indicia of employment.
JayBilas	715324617406042114	2016-03-30T23:47:33	MichaelEHuck Yes. an absurd thing for you to say. You say it to no other person, and you argue that no other person should remain unpaid.
JayBilas	715324272210608128	2016-03-30T23:46:11	MrJacobDavis That actually makes the case that athletes are exploited.
JayBilas	715324068933664768	2016-03-30T23:45:22	McquillenAj No unpaid internships are forced upon only one class of person, industry wide. You say that nonsense to no other person.
JayBilas	715323394737111040	2016-03-30T23:42:42	srventures Athletes can be out anytime now. And, they'll be paid at least a scholarship. Need them in school to make money off of them!
JayBilas	715323001915314176	2016-03-30T23:41:08	msubones No, that's an excuse. Funny how we can determine whom to pay and how much regarding everything else in the free market.
JayBilas	715322591230054400	2016-03-30T23:39:30	MatthewGaylor Yes. It's called the Sherman Antitrust Act.
JayBilas	715322425685049345	2016-03-30T23:38:50	aarmruster sporttours That's the point. Amateurism is a sham, and is whatever NCAA says it is. Olympics gave up on the sham concept.
JayBilas	715322106553061377	2016-03-30T23:37:34	KillDaWabbit2 Where would Duke be without its athletes that made it millions upon millions of dollars and fueled institutional advancement?
JayBilas	715321434663362560	2016-03-30T23:34:54	msubones No, that's true of everything. Those schools can pay more for coaches, facilities, amenities. Yet, smaller schools still compete.
JayBilas	715321061022142465	2016-03-30T23:33:25	CPOGONCH Not so. You could make the same argument regarding coaches. Actually, small schools can't compete for athlete talent now.
JayBilas	715320752564625408	2016-03-30T23:32:12	MatthewGaylor Not true. ALL athletes are being exploited by being limited, industry wide. That's the definition of exploitation.
JayBilas	715320349873692672	2016-03-30T23:30:36	JohnDavidHarman That's an expense incidental to the enterprise but, fine. Let that deal compete in the marketplace. Athletes worth more.
JayBilas	715319972558278658	2016-03-30T23:29:06	MrJacobDavis No other student must make that choice. All other students can pursue education AND earn fair market value. Only jocks can't.
JayBilas	715319440301105152	2016-03-30T23:26:59	aarmruster So, you think all on academic scholarship should be similarly restricted from pay because you have debt and would trade places?
JayBilas	715319101413920768	2016-03-30T23:25:38	Ken_Langdon Not true, or coaches pay and facilities spending would be similarly restricted. They are not. Only athletes hear that argument.
JayBilas	715318515029266432	2016-03-30T23:23:18	MrJacobDavis Absurd. But, if so valuable, let it compete on its own in the marketplace. Athletes are worth far more, and they know it.
JayBilas	715318181414379520	2016-03-30T23:21:59	MattyA510 Yes. I know who wrote it. Great people. Flawed analysis and absurd arguments.
JayBilas	715317777565810689	2016-03-30T23:20:22	MatthewGaylor All dfferent markets. You could say the same thing to coaches: Accept expenses only or go D-League = Antitrust violation.
JayBilas	715317308705492992	2016-03-30T23:18:31	msubones You say such an absurd thing to no other person. To whom else do you say, "You get nothing, industry wide or leave the country"?
JayBilas	715316860632170497	2016-03-30T23:16:44	Ken_Langdon Yes they can. You could say the same thing about coaches, employees and facilities, yet they compete in the free market in all.
JayBilas	715316570227015684	2016-03-30T23:15:34	MattyA510 About publishing an unfinished draft? Yes.
JayBilas	715316339221483520	2016-03-30T23:14:39	If "value of education" had merit, you'd prohibit all on academic scholarship from pay, too. Yet, ONLY ATHLETES are. 
JayBilas	715313564303556608	2016-03-30T23:03:38	Laughably absurd. Pay and education are not mutually exclusive. If such a great deal, let it compete in free market. 
JayBilas	715288365810249733	2016-03-30T21:23:30	Sadly, this is nothing new. These decisions take too long, clearly aren't focused on athlete welfare. Bummer.

JayBilas	715226944359497730	2016-03-30T17:19:26	CashmanFC Agreed. It would improve it. Free market works well for everyone else in the industry, it would work just as well for players.
JayBilas	715222467627913216	2016-03-30T17:01:39	CashmanFC Or, admit this is pro sports with a wage ceiling on only one class...athletes. No other person, no other student, is limited.
JayBilas	715215785447329792	2016-03-30T16:35:05	CashmanFC Laughable for those paid to tell those unpaid they are "blessed." That a protest hasn't happened doesn't validate immoral policy.

JayBilas	714959419981705216	2016-03-29T23:36:23	aaronhuff I'm talking about the merit. There is none. The SU thing was overblown and not worthy of being called a "scandal."
JayBilas	714959034911178753	2016-03-29T23:34:51	aaronhuff MinkNate My point. Very little there, and made a "scandal" by strict liability on the coach. Hardly a scandal. Disproportionate.
JayBilas	714958389537800192	2016-03-29T23:32:18	Eric_C_Fraley lawguyNA No, physicality doesn't change with quarters. And, time-outs are adjusted, fewer of them. Much better flow.
JayBilas	714957930601250818	2016-03-29T23:30:28	lawguyNA Mine taught me to make a case, not complain when someone differed. I made a case, you complained one shouldn't judge a case.

JayBilas	714955930685804544	2016-03-29T23:22:31	lawguyNA thrill10 Eric_C_Fraley The point is, if you advocate halves, you should have a legit policy reason for it. What's the reason?
JayBilas	714955580847349761	2016-03-29T23:21:08	lawguyNA thrill10 Eric_C_Fraley A legit reason for six fouls. There are 48 minutes in NBA, a foul for every 8 minutes. Same for college!
JayBilas	714954931602632705	2016-03-29T23:18:33	thrill10 lawguyNA Eric_C_Fraley You don't change fouls with quarters! You still foul out with five! You reset team fouls. Pretty simple.
JayBilas	714954625498136577	2016-03-29T23:17:20	Eric_C_Fraley lawguyNA Not so. There are quarters in HS, women's college, FIBA, every level except men's college. Why are halves better?
JayBilas	714954281087053824	2016-03-29T23:15:58	aaronhuff What were the SU violations? Can you recount them?
JayBilas	714954142977011716	2016-03-29T23:15:25	lawguyNA Huh? You're a trial lawyer? These are not just opinions, rather, informed judgments on the facts of how rules of the game work.
JayBilas	714953519590162432	2016-03-29T23:12:56	WOLFBLOOD72 Nobody advocates that. But, they're recruited as athletes first, and that's okay.

JayBilas	703802333663248384	2016-02-28T04:42:07	Fun to watch tonight. Here's the 2009 ESPN Draft coverage of StephenCurry30 getting picked. cc: JayBilas: 
JayBilas	704083337422311424	2016-02-28T23:18:43	It was THE best! Great kids, too. I got a chance to meet them, take a photo. 
JayBilas	704082778631999488	2016-02-28T23:16:30	greggvogel Yes, they missed that one. And, the double-foul was a bad call. There is hardly ever a justification for a double-foul, if ever.
JayBilas	703928174305005569	2016-02-28T13:02:09	rpete23 newt3006 The decisions that lack due process and proportionality, yes. This did not lack either. Silly comparison, really.
JayBilas	703927248374636544	2016-02-28T12:58:29	Steve Kerr nails it:  Enjoy Curry, this generation. Greats can play any era, but players today are better than ever.
JayBilas	703911920223571970	2016-02-28T11:57:34	Congrats to Chris Dailey on this well deserved honor!

JayBilas	703639734225129473	2016-02-27T17:56:00	Yes. Dunn has Dwyane Wade-type talent, and is a superior defender. barkatbilas 
JayBilas	703639463642206208	2016-02-27T17:54:55	Probably not, but it'll be close. Hield and Valentine have been awfully good, too. barkatbilas 
JayBilas	703639167167832066	2016-02-27T17:53:45	Up to each coach. I'm fine with the reprimand, but would not have argued with a suspension, either. barkatbilas

JayBilas	703634503747706880	2016-02-27T17:35:13	Maybe because he's 37 years old! No, he's really good, and gets taken for granted, I agree. Great college player. 
JayBilas	703634199379632128	2016-02-27T17:34:00	Yes, it would surprise me. If the Committee screws up seeding, maybe. It happened in 2014. barkatbilas 
JayBilas	703633788908216320	2016-02-27T17:32:22	Depends upon the finish, but I'd say a No. 3 or No. 4. barkatbilas 
JayBilas	703633502122672128	2016-02-27T17:31:14	Yes! What big man has played better? Nobody. Johnson has been excellent all season long. barkatbilas 
JayBilas	703633233653669888	2016-02-27T17:30:10	Final Four is a reasonable expectation. X is really, really good. barkatbilas 
JayBilas	703633016283860992	2016-02-27T17:29:18	It's fine. If Monmouth and the conference is cool with it, so am I. barkatbilas 
JayBilas	703632785920098304	2016-02-27T17:28:23	My guess is a No. 3 seed, but could get to 2 with a late run. barkatbilas

JayBilas	701908289601331200	2016-02-22T23:15:51	cgendicott64 I said he wouldn't get fired if he didn't call it. There was no requirement he call that technical. None.

JayBilas	701893510404956161	2016-02-22T22:17:08	bloodboughtUofL It was a judgment call. The rules did not mandate that call, nor prohibit that call. I believe it was incorrect.
JayBilas	701893170611822592	2016-02-22T22:15:47	jonthes No, it was an incorrect call. Nothing more, nothing less. It says nothing about the quality or professionalism of the official.

JayBilas	701889266486550529	2016-02-22T22:00:16	jonthes It's not "shameful." That's far too strong. He made the incorrect call. That's all.

JayBilas	701829881118773248	2016-02-22T18:04:17	ECPjohnmartin No, it's not. As often as not, it is ignored. This was not in protest, but celebratory enthusiasm. Better choice is no-call.
JayBilas	701829408051621888	2016-02-22T18:02:24	nickyp1423 No, that's just not so. Most often, it is ignored. It happened in the Maryland game Sunday. The player just caught the ball.
JayBilas	701829099862540288	2016-02-22T18:01:11	okiemarine81 No. Nobody is attacking anyone. We are disagreeing with a particular call. Nothing wrong with that.
JayBilas	701819148578512897	2016-02-22T17:21:38	BillRitchie61 No, it wasn't. That's not swallowing the whistle. It is using good judgment under the circumstances.

JayBilas	701475597776588801	2016-02-21T18:36:29	AndyEJones86 No, because we were watching. Result is irrelevant. It was a bad call, isolated, on its own.

JayBilas	701472483724161024	2016-02-21T18:24:07	AndyEJones86 Nobody said it decided the game. That is irrelevant to whether the call was correct.

JayBilas	701451348110393344	2016-02-21T17:00:08	mscottlawson No, that is not so. How the player reacted to the incorrect call is irrelevant. The call was incorrect, and poor judgment.
JayBilas	701450946631639041	2016-02-21T16:58:32	MattatTheState No, it is not the same thing. In fact, it is a totally different sport. I have seen such things go uncalled many times.

JayBilas	701450531248676865	2016-02-21T16:56:53	aderhag9 That is simply incorrect. The call is in the judgment of officials. If uncalled, officials would NOT be called on the carpet.
JayBilas	701450108056027136	2016-02-21T16:55:12	mscottlawson Sorry, but that is a Little League stance. This is not Little League. It was not the right call.

JayBilas	701443740938989569	2016-02-21T16:29:54	buffylew Not true. Several officials privately say they would not call that, nor would the officials be called on the carpet if uncalled.

JayBilas	701442477413310464	2016-02-21T16:24:53	BrettLange12 No, that's not so. I see it go uncalled.

JayBilas	701441422373818368	2016-02-21T16:20:41	KyleTucker_CJ wildcatnews I communicated with Kennedy. TAMU was mistaken, confused by the situation. Properly administered by officials.
JayBilas	701440914951163910	2016-02-21T16:18:40	CD_one3 No, it was it ignored. Official didn't see it. I looked at replay. Understandable to miss that.
JayBilas	701440553720930306	2016-02-21T16:17:14	republicanMDfan No, it was both.
JayBilas	701434090847936514	2016-02-21T15:51:33	CPark_1985 No, the charge call was horrendous and wrong. But, the technical was justified.
JayBilas	701430338468364291	2016-02-21T15:36:39	The unsporting technical foul on Humphries was unnecessary and wrong, in my judgment. It should not have been called.
JayBilas	701426827953360896	2016-02-21T15:22:42	Texas A&amp;M did not choose Skal Labissiere to shoot the free throws. Calipari made that choice.
JayBilas	701426496649437184	2016-02-21T15:21:23	As Humphries fouled out, it was UK's choice as to the substitute to shoot. If it were an injury, the opposing coach can choose the shooter.
JayBilas	701426188556836864	2016-02-21T15:20:09	The unsporting technical foul on Humphries was a judgment call by the official. Rules do not require it to be called, nor not to be called.
JayBilas	701425799572881410	2016-02-21T15:18:37	Very unusual end of game in UK-TAMU was poorly communicated, but properly administered. It was UK's choice of sub to shoot for Humphries.
JayBilas	701416301089189890	2016-02-21T14:40:52	gwalt3574 Please. A horrendous call. But, there are horrendous charge/block calls all the time, and there is not "wall to wall" coverage.
JayBilas	701414725536628736	2016-02-21T14:34:36	JayEl312 That is unreasonable. If "letting it slip" is the standard, all employees in contact with players and coaches should be dismissed.
JayBilas	701414406777864192	2016-02-21T14:33:20	JayEl312 Yes. All hires are approved. AD and President hire the coach, know staff. Or, are you only reasonable to those above the coach?
JayBilas	701413554071674880	2016-02-21T14:29:57	JayEl312 Reasonably should have known does not allow plausible deniability. If McGee was an arsonist, is boss reasonably expected to know?
JayBilas	701401826340577283	2016-02-21T13:43:21	JayEl312 So, the president, AD, head of HR, and all Trustees should be summarily dismissed? Are they not responsible for at least the same?
JayBilas	701401412392112128	2016-02-21T13:41:42	JayEl312 No, it's not. Know or reasonably should know is a fair and reasonable standard.
JayBilas	701401105037705216	2016-02-21T13:40:29	JayEl312 Yes, I do. I don't believe he knew, nor do I believe one should reasonably be expected to know such a thing.
JayBilas	701400790540414976	2016-02-21T13:39:14	roughlyandrew gspence1 Issue now is, official said UK chooses the shooter. TAMU coach said Skal was TAMU's choice. Discrepancy.
JayBilas	701395695790469120	2016-02-21T13:18:59	JayEl312 That's fine. You attributed a falsity to me. You were wrong.
JayBilas	701395455666556928	2016-02-21T13:18:02	CJRogers6 KySportsRadio I said that is possible. If Kennedy chose Skal, it could not have been administered by the official talking to me.

JayBilas	701393370409664513	2016-02-21T13:09:45	JayEl312 If you "interpreted" it another way, that's on you. I was clear, and have been from the beginning on this.
JayBilas	701393107162521601	2016-02-21T13:08:42	JayEl312 Unreasonable to hold anyone responsible for what they do not know or should not reasonably have known.
JayBilas	701392804526723072	2016-02-21T13:07:30	JayEl312 McGee's actions were so unreasonable and so far outside of his job responsibilities, unreasonable to expect his superiors to know.
JayBilas	701392430591975424	2016-02-21T13:06:01	JayEl312 No, I said each person should be responsible for what is reasonably within his job duties, know or reasonably should have known.

JayBilas	701380092774121473	2016-02-21T12:16:59	kennyhoo Bizarre situation, never seen it before. Humphries fouled out, his replacement shoots. If injured, opposing coach chooses shooter.
JayBilas	701379703911747585	2016-02-21T12:15:27	KentuckyKroge The rule doesn't state it. It's a judgment call, and the officials used poor judgment.

JayBilas	699343770400223233	2016-02-15T21:25:22	hoops_uva I believe UVA is the better team this year. But, officiating did not determine the outcome, IMO. You're rationalizing.

JayBilas	695362025262743552	2016-02-04T21:43:20	DWEdgemon Women's college basketball has quarters! FIBA has quarters!! High School has quarters!! It's not an NBA issue! Wake up!!
JayBilas	695361616510988288	2016-02-04T21:41:43	zachbinkley No, I said it's profitable, popular, and a better game in every way. If you prefer college, it's not for the basketball.
JayBilas	695361246405627904	2016-02-04T21:40:14	zachbinkley There are many reasons, but it's naive to believe  revenue isn't a primary reason. It is.
JayBilas	695361011109367810	2016-02-04T21:39:18	DWEdgemon No, you're wrong on this. If you choose to dislike every level of basketball except college due to quarters, that's your choice.
JayBilas	695359924990181377	2016-02-04T21:34:59	DWEdgemon By that logic, why reset fouls at half? You're arguing without thinking. First, it was happiness, now it's foul deterrent value.
JayBilas	695359519514189824	2016-02-04T21:33:23	DWEdgemon No. It doesn't saddle a team with fouls (bad calls) for an entire half. You could make the same claim about halftime reset.
JayBilas	695358087989825536	2016-02-04T21:27:41	DWEdgemon Yes, it does indicate it is better. It's clear, if you watch it and understand it.
JayBilas	695357432344674305	2016-02-04T21:25:05	DWEdgemon "People are happy" is not a good policy reason. People were "happy" with peach baskets, too. This will improve the game.
JayBilas	695357017360216065	2016-02-04T21:23:26	DWEdgemon Simple. Team fouls reset at end of first and third quarters. Much better flow, fewer FTA. Proven by FIBA, NBA, Women's college.
JayBilas	695356469357649921	2016-02-04T21:21:16	DWEdgemon Why fight it? Why are you against it?
JayBilas	695342946510483456	2016-02-04T20:27:31	DWEdgemon Grow up. ESPN isn't changing anything. The rest of the world plays with quarters, a wider lane and a longer 3pt line. How myopic.
JayBilas	695329137637122048	2016-02-04T19:32:39	DWEdgemon I asked you what team or teams you watch, and what they run. It's really not a hard question.
JayBilas	695327008428068864	2016-02-04T19:24:12	DWEdgemon I do know. I am asking you.
JayBilas	695326897643855872	2016-02-04T19:23:45	DNeckel19 That's not so. Ratings are much better for NBA games.
JayBilas	695326722930012160	2016-02-04T19:23:03	jslayton21 I would differ. It is quite physical, and the defense is excellent. You should watch it.
JayBilas	695311910057725952	2016-02-04T18:24:12	JJGillispie You don't go to many sports bars, then.
JayBilas	695308836882792449	2016-02-04T18:11:59	DWEdgemon What teams run fluid motion?
JayBilas	695308679730610176	2016-02-04T18:11:22	DWEdgemon Never.
JayBilas	695307233081565184	2016-02-04T18:05:37	DWEdgemon Good one! But, if I went by today, you are ever right!
JayBilas	695306965656936448	2016-02-04T18:04:33	DWEdgemon Cut to the chase. Tell me what team you watch and what it runs on offense that you approve of so much.
JayBilas	695306670386372608	2016-02-04T18:03:23	DWEdgemon 61% of all touches result in a pass. Did you read it? It said NBA is hardly a ball hog league.
JayBilas	695302249199734784	2016-02-04T17:45:48	DWEdgemon You don't need to like the NBA. But, your incorrect use of data is not dispositive of the issue you brought up. You're wrong.
JayBilas	695301690967216128	2016-02-04T17:43:35	DWEdgemon You said ESPN doesn't like defense, which is total nonsense. Defense leads to better offensive efficiency, vice versa.
JayBilas	695301263873814528	2016-02-04T17:41:54	DWEdgemon NBA teams DO move the ball. You are incorrect. On your "touches," 61% pass, 29% shoot, 6% draw a foul and 4% turn it over.
JayBilas	695300370424156160	2016-02-04T17:38:21	DWEdgemon Your continued suggestion that NBA teams don't play defense, and it is because of clock, lane and 3pt line, is nonsense.
JayBilas	695300164790038528	2016-02-04T17:37:31	DWEdgemon Defense leads to transition, which you suggest is a lesser play because it has two or fewer passes. That is just incorrect.
JayBilas	695299972531511296	2016-02-04T17:36:46	DWEdgemon You suggest through your 53% assertion that a fast break or transition play is not good basketball. It is. Most strive for that.
JayBilas	695299428316377088	2016-02-04T17:34:36	BigSkyHoo DNeckel19 Actually, it does. Look at offensive and defensive efficiency, the winningest teams are at or near the top in both.
JayBilas	695298715502776320	2016-02-04T17:31:46	jonmiller51 DWEdgemon Sounds like you need to actually read the presented data, too. It doesn't stand for the proposition you assert.
JayBilas	695298479317385216	2016-02-04T17:30:50	DNeckel19 Yes. NBA is ahead of college in most efficient ways to score. What, you don't approve of how Golden State or mid-majors play?
JayBilas	695298121119588352	2016-02-04T17:29:24	DWEdgemon And, read the entire piece. See touches per second and over half of all shots taken without a dribble. Not as you described.
JayBilas	695297259055898624	2016-02-04T17:25:59	DWEdgemon If you look at efficiency statistics, "better" basketball is played ahead of the defense rather than as you posit.
JayBilas	695297009570287616	2016-02-04T17:24:59	DWEdgemon  That "data" says it begins when player is in "reasonable attacking position." And, efficiency is higher at 2 than 3, 4 or 5.
JayBilas	695295113744941056	2016-02-04T17:17:27	DWEdgemon And, if I had a "comfortable position of authority," I'd just ignore you. Happy to engage, but you're incorrect here.
JayBilas	695294724505100289	2016-02-04T17:15:54	DWEdgemon It's not an escape. Your statements are incorrect. You are entitled to your own opinion, but not your own facts.
JayBilas	695294330836119552	2016-02-04T17:14:21	DWEdgemon No,you're incorrect. You can see plenty of PNR, ISO and all you complain of in college ball, while NBA makes more passes.
JayBilas	695293973980585984	2016-02-04T17:12:55	DWEdgemon Nobody is "ruining" anything. You won't notice anyway. Sorry, but you clearly don't watch or pay attention. You're wrong here.
JayBilas	695293785714995201	2016-02-04T17:12:11	DWEdgemon The rest of the world plays with a 24-second clock and has wonderfully imaginative offense and actions. You simply don't watch.
JayBilas	695293621562572800	2016-02-04T17:11:31	DWEdgemon That's nonsense. Great offense can be run with a 24-second clock and poor offense can be run with no clock. How silly.
JayBilas	695293361788313601	2016-02-04T17:10:30	DWEdgemon Engagement of players is not determined by shot clock, line or pick-and-roll. If you think it is, you don't understand the game.
JayBilas	695293043449024518	2016-02-04T17:09:14	DWEdgemon Shot clock, quarters or three-point lines have no impact upon defense or the use of pick-and-roll. No basis for your statements.
JayBilas	695292683753893888	2016-02-04T17:07:48	DWEdgemon Sorry, but that is total nonsense. If you think pick-and-roll is "ugly" you don't like or understand basketball.
JayBilas	695292105900470273	2016-02-04T17:05:30	JJGillispie Sorry, but that is nonsense and without basis. NBA and FIBA rules are great. The college game would benefit greatly.
JayBilas	695291869169713154	2016-02-04T17:04:34	2lowtech No, we must accept reality. Jump balls were a disaster, and that is why the alternate possession was introduced.
JayBilas	695290030516883457	2016-02-04T16:57:15	DWEdgemon How silly. We are discussing rules of a game. Where a line is placed does not make it like the NBA.
JayBilas	695282825570971649	2016-02-04T16:28:38	Jeff_Boy_Ardee We differ. From that statement, you clearly don't watch the NBA or most college games.
JayBilas	695281524934066176	2016-02-04T16:23:27	Jeff_Boy_Ardee Please. Where a line is painted is not related to entertainment. if you think college isn't entertainment, you're blind.
JayBilas	695278619686522880	2016-02-04T16:11:55	2lowtech Nor does a poor toss. It doesn't work. Watch each game opening toss.
JayBilas	695278209194188800	2016-02-04T16:10:17	DWEdgemon You clearly don't watch the NBA. College can learn a lot from how the NBA game is administered. Better in almost every way.
JayBilas	695277820310872064	2016-02-04T16:08:44	2lowtech  Five second count is already gone. And, refs can't throw the ball up. They all suck at it. Alternate possession is better.
JayBilas	695277522779574273	2016-02-04T16:07:33	erecasner Yes, you missed something. Curry plays at both ends, and rebounds, too.

JayBilas	695276703686512640	2016-02-04T16:04:18	BMKramer Incorrect. Same stoppages, fewer free throws. The games have far better flow with quarters, as evidenced by the rest of the world.
JayBilas	695276365319430144	2016-02-04T16:02:57	LambchopPG Nonsense. The courts are the same size. Nobody complains about scoring, nor should they. Silly.
JayBilas	695276042789978112	2016-02-04T16:01:40	UVaKareBear Stop. The rest of the world has adapted, and the game is better. By your logic, we'd still have peach baskets.

JayBilas	690228289571573761	2016-01-21T17:43:42	PortCityTH meisterbuerger That's more nonsense. They are talking about outside influences. And, these coaches recruited them.
JayBilas	690227372742840322	2016-01-21T17:40:04	meisterbuerger Which is what? Power and money. College coaches say players that are unpaid and have no voice are "entitled." Incongruous.
JayBilas	690227126096793608	2016-01-21T17:39:05	UstateAggies All spending on athletics is totally unchecked. Athletes deserve to compete for their fair piece of the ever expanding pie.

JayBilas	690226052971544576	2016-01-21T17:34:49	meisterbuerger It has everything to do with money. These coaches complain because they are no longer the only voice...because of money.
JayBilas	690225776994717696	2016-01-21T17:33:43	UstateAggies Not so. Nobody ever says athletes decrease if coaches' salaries escalate, or if facilities spending escalates. Only athletes.
JayBilas	690224662534623232	2016-01-21T17:29:17	UstateAggies That is untrue and has no basis in economics. In fact, opposite is true. You show "care" about athletes by limiting them?

JayBilas	689882636219584512	2016-01-20T18:50:12	DinkDumpDish Mikey_Jarrell Not so. Now, small school can't compete at all for talent. If pay, small can pay more for big's 3rd best guy.

JayBilas	689882003835977728	2016-01-20T18:47:41	DinkDumpDish Mikey_Jarrell The opposite. Big schools dominate now, unbalanced now. If pay allowed, small schools can compete for talent.

JayBilas	688391706677477376	2016-01-16T16:05:47	Looking forward to seeing SethOnHoops (pictured) in studio today! The Bilastrator is at ND v. Duke at 2pm, ESPN. 
JayBilas	688390649176027136	2016-01-16T16:01:35	ConnorWilsonLAS How idiotic. This abhorrent behavior can be addressed without over-correcting, banning "airball" chants and fun. Grow up.
JayBilas	688388626066108416	2016-01-16T15:53:32	JohnDavidHarman manopeace3 bootnyps19 Silly. You tell nobody else they have to leave to profit in an endeavor they get used for profit.
JayBilas	688388258368196608	2016-01-16T15:52:05	They're STILL worried about "airball" chant, and when it's used! Lighten up. The kids aren't made of tissue paper! 
JayBilas	688386612447817730	2016-01-16T15:45:32	JohnDavidHarman manopeace3 bootnyps19 Plenty marketable. And, they can do BOTH. Money and education are not mutually exclusive.
JayBilas	688386219424747520	2016-01-16T15:43:58	Demetrius Jackson of NDmbb: 17 points and 5.4 assists. 1 of 2 players (NC State's Cat Barber) in ACC Top 5 in scoring and assists.
JayBilas	688356172450140160	2016-01-16T13:44:35	Oklahoma State managers beat Texas managers, 78-65. Cowboys' Keiton Page hit 10 three-point field goals.

JayBilas	688199919320973314	2016-01-16T03:23:41	Texas manager Richard "%#$@" Curry: Puts everything he has into managing. Plays all out until winded. Usually subbed after 30 seconds.
JayBilas	688199053063016448	2016-01-16T03:20:15	Texas manager Jeremy "Big Shot" Berman: Deep range, never passes. Believed to be allergic to pre-practice rebounding for the players.
JayBilas	688198426169720832	2016-01-16T03:17:45	Texas manager Alex Cerda: Listed as doubtful. Lost Shaka Smart's whistle, can't play until found. Retracing steps, library unnecessary.
JayBilas	688197599048826882	2016-01-16T03:14:28	Texas manager Alex Kaufman: Called "Kaufy Machine" but drinks only green tea. Volume shooter, limited maker. Eats right and left handed.
JayBilas	688196758837432321	2016-01-16T03:11:08	Texas manager Blake "Yet to Touch the Rim" Bender: Training hard to go from useless to merely awkward. In charge of Shaka's power bars.
JayBilas	688196107776593920	2016-01-16T03:08:32	Texas manager Joey Pennavaria: Often laments "I could've played D1, but hurt my knee." Still has not been located in a HS team photo.
JayBilas	688195452517220352	2016-01-16T03:05:56	Texas manager Spencer "Crawdad" Crawford: His "dad body" doesn't suggest his being an athlete or having a girlfriend. GPA higher than PPG.
JayBilas	688194658225147905	2016-01-16T03:02:47	Texas manager Brandyn Hawk: called "Young Shaka"; claims "bad back" limits his ability to play defense and carry Gatorade containers.
JayBilas	688193913752948736	2016-01-16T02:59:49	Texas managers taking on Oklahoma State managers in the Erwin Center tonight! 
JayBilas	688193467273445377	2016-01-16T02:58:03	Sweet. Hardest working people in show business. 
JayBilas	688193131674644481	2016-01-16T02:56:43	JohnDavidHarman How idiotic. Quitting in protest accomplishes nothing. Media doesn't restrict player compensation. NCAA does.
JayBilas	688192630564388870	2016-01-16T02:54:43	Awesome. 
JayBilas	688191447669944321	2016-01-16T02:50:01	Pastides says NCAA enforcement "always fair?" Really? He probably noticed that when he saw Bigfoot on a unicorn. 
JayBilas	688190666208182272	2016-01-16T02:46:55	Yeah, who needs transparency? So many wonderful things happen when cloaked in secrecy. Is he joking?!

JayBilas	688120857604956160	2016-01-15T22:09:31	aaroniverson beavewdh Landgrant33 So? A nonsensical comparison. Allow fair market value, and you'll see players are worth far more.
JayBilas	688086273387540480	2016-01-15T19:52:06	aaroniverson beavewdh Landgrant33 No, it's an expense item, and limited to only that. Nobody else is limited.

JayBilas	688025063866667009	2016-01-15T15:48:52	FOXSportsBrad FOXSportsKnox RyanCahak Wow. The Bilastrator and three anonymous schleps.
JayBilas	688023690936741888	2016-01-15T15:43:25	Cohan918 Of course not. It's patently ridiculous, and proven so. Plus, no athlete misses less time in school than football players. None.
JayBilas	688021899482378241	2016-01-15T15:36:18	Not one more game due to athletes' physical maturity, academics?  They said that when there were 12 games. Please.
JayBilas	688020151158095872	2016-01-15T15:29:21	kris_cunningham Your article says it was not an ultimatum but a directive. Directive means order or command. The WIAA was out of bounds.
JayBilas	688019751822573570	2016-01-15T15:27:46	kris_cunningham You are conflating issues. She used an improper word. But, the policy is still wrongheaded and ridiculous.
JayBilas	688019353921523712	2016-01-15T15:26:11	kris_cunningham I differ. The WIAA was called out, and then backpedaled. Good intentions, maybe. Over-regulating, absolutely.
JayBilas	687991201249816576	2016-01-15T13:34:19	BPrzybyla12 Consider: how do schools know who to recruit, who to play minutes, who to feature in marketing? They know who to pay, how much.
JayBilas	687990762395545600	2016-01-15T13:32:34	BPrzybyla12 In what endeavor does everyone make the same? Let schools pay what they like, as with everyone else. Pretty simple.
JayBilas	687990491208650752	2016-01-15T13:31:30	kris_cunningham It's not outrage. We were laughing at the silliness of it. And, we still are.

JayBilas	687836530891702278	2016-01-15T03:19:43	osumatt99 Nonsense. That's creative accounting. Salaries skyrocket, staffs increase exponentially, facilities left and right. They can pay.
JayBilas	687836186866544641	2016-01-15T03:18:20	aaroniverson beavewdh Landgrant33 Yes, all. Deals just a small part of revenues. If they can pay everyone else, they can pay athletes.
JayBilas	687806762129428480	2016-01-15T01:21:25	AlexJewellaj You need to recharge your phone.
JayBilas	687803333302554624	2016-01-15T01:07:48	AlexJewellaj Not that number, but there is plenty of money in the system to compensate players. It's dishonest to suggest otherwise.
JayBilas	687797014806016002	2016-01-15T00:42:41	Aaron Rodgers gets it. Those over-regulating sports need to lighten up. Well intentioned, but over the top. 
JayBilas	687796089437683712	2016-01-15T00:39:01	Remember, these schools don't have any money. Can't make ends meet in this multi-billion dollar industry, huh? 
JayBilas	687795527182848000	2016-01-15T00:36:46	WIHistorytchr Airball chants, ribbing refs, fun distractions to the opponent are not disrespectful. All part of a great game atmosphere.

JayBilas	687605840577204225	2016-01-14T12:03:02	Throwback Thursday! The Bilastrator among Americans playing overseas. Ciao, baby. 
JayBilas	687591378260463616	2016-01-14T11:05:34	Still count a quarter mil with my eyes closed. One hand behind my back and a freakin' blindfold. I gotta go to work.
JayBilas	687525550169063424	2016-01-14T06:43:59	vpartysports Whether they'd rather be elsewhere is irrelevant. Non-athletes may prefer to leave, but have to stay, too. Value judgments.
JayBilas	687525115190358016	2016-01-14T06:42:15	vpartysports I'm not a fan of that. If a student doesn't belong in your school, that's your call. But, all students belong in some college.
JayBilas	687524828752969728	2016-01-14T06:41:07	vpartysports Still, going to class is up to each school to deal with, not NCAA.
JayBilas	687521724330463233	2016-01-14T06:28:47	vpartysports I hear you. But, there's an argument that keeping underserved out for arbitrary standard does far more harm to that person.
JayBilas	687510320391163905	2016-01-14T05:43:28	vpartysports You do. Underscores that different schools can do it differently. It's just sports. We don't police anything else like this.
JayBilas	687509966601629696	2016-01-14T05:42:04	vpartysports I didn't study pre-law. I was a political science major. Can't get much easier!
JayBilas	687509689576206336	2016-01-14T05:40:57	legend034 Not so. Each school can dictate to coaches the proper balance.
JayBilas	687509372285485056	2016-01-14T05:39:42	vpartysports They are already productive members of society. These aren't correctional institutions, but colleges. Each school can decide.
JayBilas	687506250364547072	2016-01-14T05:27:17	vpartysports Laws of society and choice of courses, hours, and majors are clearly different things.
JayBilas	687506027445665793	2016-01-14T05:26:24	vpartysports Overwhelming majority are, in my experience.
JayBilas	687505040957902849	2016-01-14T05:22:29	vpartysports "One-size fits all" standards are what cause schools to encourage an athlete down an easier, less risky path. That's my point!
JayBilas	687504670412124164	2016-01-14T05:21:01	vpartysports Eligibility rules guarantee that! A student cannot challenge limits because of concern over arbitrary eligibility standards.
JayBilas	687503979060850688	2016-01-14T05:18:16	vpartysports That's great. You should emphasize that at your school. It is not workable as policy for all. Too many different missions.
JayBilas	687503656942436352	2016-01-14T05:16:59	vpartysports So many courses offered in liberal arts schools have little future value. So what? Each school can decide what to offer.
JayBilas	687503370739970048	2016-01-14T05:15:51	vpartysports If it's offered by an accredited college, what quarrel do you have with it? My daughter is an art major. Does she lack ethics?
JayBilas	687503053554085888	2016-01-14T05:14:35	vpartysports They know why they're there. No other student has industry-wide restrictions on time spent on any endeavor. Only athletes.
JayBilas	687502630927634432	2016-01-14T05:12:55	vpartysports I differ. That's like saying NCAA should have health policy, monitored by a student's weight. It does not work, unenforceable.
JayBilas	687502089388449792	2016-01-14T05:10:45	vpartysports There isn't one. Many schools have a 50% grad rate for all students. Athletes are much higher. How do you reconcile that?
JayBilas	687501543726252032	2016-01-14T05:08:35	vpartysports What is the "real reason"? Each school can determine that for itself. The value judgments are not helpful.
JayBilas	687499684244525056	2016-01-14T05:01:12	You will be seeing these on The Bilastrator soon. These Nike are SWEET. 
JayBilas	687499126418849793	2016-01-14T04:58:59	vpartysports No apology necessary. We're just talking. Standards differ from school to school. One school's best fails at another school.
JayBilas	687498730438787072	2016-01-14T04:57:25	vpartysports Cutting corners? How does practice cut corners? These "one-size fits all" policies simply don't work. Never have.
JayBilas	687496399630528512	2016-01-14T04:48:09	vpartysports So, if I decide to practice an hour per day more than you, I don't value education? What if I decide to see a movie?
JayBilas	687496057434042368	2016-01-14T04:46:47	vpartysports Practice time and ethics are not linked that way. If each school decides how much to practice, how is anyone unethical?
JayBilas	687486405853995008	2016-01-14T04:08:26	bluebloodcoug No worries. I was just having fun with you. I can take it, I promise.
JayBilas	687483111492435968	2016-01-14T03:55:21	Embrace_Me_Now As often as they can, but not that much. Have to play late, and not all managers travel. Can be tough logistically.

JayBilas	687478153233743872	2016-01-14T03:35:39	stevenkoskela vpartysports Why would you care? Many programs practicing less to improve performance anyway. Each can decide for itself.

JayBilas	687394945192357888	2016-01-13T22:05:00	MTNesto It is not difficult, it is wholly ineffective and therefore meaningless regulation to make it look as if something is being done.
JayBilas	687385670973845504	2016-01-13T21:28:09	MTNesto It is already about academics. But, any standard that you could come up with would be so low as to be meaningless to most, anyway.
JayBilas	687385406501949445	2016-01-13T21:27:06	MTNesto What standard applies to every other admissions decision? None. Each school makes its own decisions. Pretty simple, as is.

JayBilas	687377014987337729	2016-01-13T20:53:45	MTNesto If you think any student needs to be in class more, that is a powerful issue to bring forth on your campus, not for every campus.
JayBilas	687376838163828737	2016-01-13T20:53:03	MTNesto No, it is true. There is no national standard on admissions or grading for any other student. It is up to each institution.
JayBilas	687376586149113856	2016-01-13T20:52:03	MTNesto You have a low opinion of the integrity of professors. Wow. And, not one AD in America has the power to pass a student in class.
JayBilas	687376167440105474	2016-01-13T20:50:23	MTNesto No, it is already "federalized" for every other admissions, education decision right now. No reason athletics should be different.
JayBilas	687375868138799105	2016-01-13T20:49:12	MTNesto That is not one-size fits all. Whether to pay and how much are decisions up to each entity. Prohibiting pay is one-size fits all.
JayBilas	687375518124118020	2016-01-13T20:47:48	MTNesto These arguments appropriate on each campus, not for an athletic governing body. Incorrect that academics are athletic advantage.
JayBilas	687375041810591744	2016-01-13T20:45:55	MTNesto That would be great...at your school. There is no way that a one-size fits all rule will fix the issues that you consider problems.
JayBilas	687373023897366529	2016-01-13T20:37:54	MTNesto This is an argument you should have on your campus. It is not for a governing body. Each school can admit whomever it likes.

JayBilas	687364421765742592	2016-01-13T20:03:43	MTNesto They do. The issue was one of clustering in certain majors. It is up to each school to admit and educate students of its choice.

JayBilas	685850423987589120	2016-01-09T15:47:38	js_avvamericano Yes. They go to great lengths to say they are in charge, yet they don't accept any responsibility.
JayBilas	685849996449595393	2016-01-09T15:45:56	RonVanover No, it didn't happen so fast. Even American Pharoah was mentioned. It was quite clear.
JayBilas	685849507641200641	2016-01-09T15:43:59	js_avvamericano Not in my judgment, no. If it were so easy, why don't the presidents accept such strict liability upon their shoulders?
JayBilas	685848360910127105	2016-01-09T15:39:26	RonVanover It was clear from the beginning.
JayBilas	685848105682534400	2016-01-09T15:38:25	UCMAmbrose That's fantasy. You've proven conclusively that this enterprise is about money. There is no legitimate reason to limit athletes.
JayBilas	685847509223096321	2016-01-09T15:36:03	UCMAmbrose No, you provide whatever you want AT YOUR SCHOOL. Every other school can provide what it wants. That's competition.
JayBilas	685842426007666688	2016-01-09T15:15:51	WMoushey All reasonable people ask is that athletes be allowed to be compensated. If a particular school doesn't want to pay, fine.
JayBilas	685841893452722176	2016-01-09T15:13:44	RonVanover Ridiculous. I said he "threw a shoe." It's a horse reference, and Kentucky is horse country. "Lame" is also a horse reference.
JayBilas	685840938023780352	2016-01-09T15:09:56	UCMAmbrose You can keep saying "values," but your decisions reveal your priorities...money and education. They are not mutually exclusive!
JayBilas	685840289370472453	2016-01-09T15:07:21	UCMAmbrose It DOES reflect your values! NCAA members value the business of sport! Like NCAA, your rhetoric ignores this clear reality.
JayBilas	685839626326511616	2016-01-09T15:04:43	js_avvamericano CEOs are not sanctioned in such a disproportionate fashion, for things not reasonably within their job. Nor is NCAA CEO!
JayBilas	685839118035623936	2016-01-09T15:02:42	WMoushey I see no reason to limit athlete compensation. Nobody else is limited. There is no cap on facilities spending. Why just athletes?

JayBilas	685679293066797057	2016-01-09T04:27:37	UCMAmbrose As do I. But, we do not pay each other our fair market value while at the same time limiting the pay of those we profit off of.
JayBilas	685678504864804864	2016-01-09T04:24:29	UCMAmbrose Not so. You have been saying that forever. Revenues keep rising. Athletes should be allowed to compete in that market, too.
JayBilas	685677605178228736	2016-01-09T04:20:55	MattHendricks1 Sorry, but that is just a lame excuse and not a legitimate justification for limiting athletes to expenses only.
JayBilas	685677475087675392	2016-01-09T04:20:23	MattHendricks1 Its not free. And, that is irrelevant. Are coaches limited in pay because others have it tough? No. Nobody is, but athletes.

JayBilas	685676493373075456	2016-01-09T04:16:29	UCMAmbrose NoceraNYT What shows no understanding is the myopic view that players can be sold for billions but cannot earn fair value.
JayBilas	685676243413544960	2016-01-09T04:15:30	MattHendricks1 So? That has nothing to do with market value and pay. Everyone else is allowed fair market value. Athletes should be, too.
JayBilas	685675974265024512	2016-01-09T04:14:26	MattHendricks1 No, same pot. The rest is just accounting. Nobody else is limited in pay because of booster contributions.
JayBilas	685675790923624449	2016-01-09T04:13:42	UCMAmbrose NoceraNYT Please. You pay everyone else what the market demands. Athletes should be allowed the same. Multi-billions generated.

JayBilas	685673662247235584	2016-01-09T04:05:14	MattHendricks1 Not really. Basketball is a big revenue producer. But, it doesn't matter. Each school should pay what it wants to pay.
JayBilas	685673419258609664	2016-01-09T04:04:17	fbcoachtom10 SC_Tiger Yes. Roster limits are in place now. That is a reasonable regulation of a sport.
JayBilas	685673282020990976	2016-01-09T04:03:44	MattHendricks1 No, of course not. Funny how that is not asked when coaches make $5 million or facilities are built.
JayBilas	685671381737037824	2016-01-09T03:56:11	fbcoachtom10 SC_Tiger The way I see it, if your school wishes not to pay, or limit pay, fine. But, limiting all via cartel rule is wrong.
JayBilas	685671073581502465	2016-01-09T03:54:57	fbcoachtom10 SC_Tiger Why limit players when nobody else is limited? No other student is limited, either. Why do athletes alone sacrifice?
JayBilas	685670842685067264	2016-01-09T03:54:02	MattHendricks1 Read the Washington Post series on college athletics spending. The money spent on salaries, facilities is staggering.
JayBilas	685670681636397056	2016-01-09T03:53:24	MattHendricks1 Really? Coaches, administrators, other employees. Alabama is paying a strength coach over $500,000 a year.

JayBilas	685670188113637376	2016-01-09T03:51:26	mjlorange Nah, saying "okay, pay them, but make them pay for school" is a petty response. They would make far more than that, anyway.

JayBilas	685669526508310528	2016-01-09T03:48:48	SC_Tiger fbcoachtom10 Yes, I do. Look at current expenditures. No reason athletes should not be allowed to compete for those dollars.
JayBilas	685668454888816640	2016-01-09T03:44:33	mjlorange That's mostly a petty response. Schools would just pay more than scholarship costs. Need the in school to profit off of them!
JayBilas	685668105872404480	2016-01-09T03:43:10	MattHendricks1 No, that's not so. There is plenty of money, and revenues keep rising. Athletes should be allowed to share, like all others.
JayBilas	685667926914023425	2016-01-09T03:42:27	fbcoachtom10 I would advocate that schools be allowed to pay whomever they like whatever they like, as with everyone else (but athletes).
JayBilas	685640787435061249	2016-01-09T01:54:36	sodapopscully Interesting. It's what every school should do: figure out where your balance is. But, there's no "one-size fits all" answer.

JayBilas	685224729666564096	2016-01-07T22:21:21	DMoneyKYboy Kind of a silly example. With roster limits, the problems you imagine do not really exist. Just excuses, doomsday scenarios.
JayBilas	685224355966676992	2016-01-07T22:19:51	DMoneyKYboy Respectfully, you are simply making excuses without a legit justification for NCAA policy that limits wages on only athletes.
JayBilas	685224133077118977	2016-01-07T22:18:58	DMoneyKYboy Athletes alone should not be limited for "competitive balance" reasons. There is no competitive balance now.

JayBilas	685222670665969664	2016-01-07T22:13:10	DMoneyKYboy Simple economics. No UNC recruit is going to Clemson. NONE. If pay allowed, CU can offer more to UNC's third guy than UNC can.
JayBilas	685222183317204992	2016-01-07T22:11:13	curt_graff Nope. There is a lot of money riding on this. NCAA saw Oregon beaten last year with fewer hours. Just common sense.

JayBilas	685218401430728704	2016-01-07T21:56:12	DMoneyKYboy Silly. PLAYERS CAN BE FIRED NOW. They can be dismissed for no reason NOW. With pay, there would be a contract, and remedies.
JayBilas	685218165148749824	2016-01-07T21:55:15	DMoneyKYboy These players can be fired now. They are not because they are needed. Employees are not just fired indiscriminately.
JayBilas	685217978925867009	2016-01-07T21:54:31	DMoneyKYboy He's getting picked apart anyway. You are conflating issues and making excuses. This is not justification to limit athletes.

JayBilas	685217028857278464	2016-01-07T21:50:45	DMoneyKYboy Perhaps you should monitor the court cases being litigated. Your judgment on that may be in doubt.
JayBilas	685216841812316160	2016-01-07T21:50:00	DMoneyKYboy No, you act as if this is a local Little League. It is a multi-billion dollar pro enterprise.
JayBilas	685216649742565376	2016-01-07T21:49:14	DMoneyKYboy Everything in America is comparable to business of the NCAA. All other industries pay employees, do not violate antitrust law.
JayBilas	685216314114334720	2016-01-07T21:47:54	DMoneyKYboy So? This isn't your company. If a school doesn't wish to pay, then don't. But, they should be allowed to pay if they wish.
JayBilas	685216142034599937	2016-01-07T21:47:13	JC_Hamilton6 PNWUte Mormon_madness1 Can you take me off of your whiny little pity party, please. Thank you!
JayBilas	685215915382861825	2016-01-07T21:46:19	DMoneyKYboy No, it's not. Everyone else gets paid and there is no such outcry. That is just an excuse not to pay, and a lame one.
JayBilas	685215758377422849	2016-01-07T21:45:42	scarolinaboiler I don't see it as a big deal. What is the alternative? But, the big conferences need to hire and employ the best officials.
JayBilas	685215547437486080	2016-01-07T21:44:51	JC_Hamilton6 anotherexpert My stance is "harder" than yours. I accept the decision. You whine about it, insult those that differ with you.
JayBilas	685214938080624641	2016-01-07T21:42:26	DMoneyKYboy Minors make money all the time. It is not an issue.
JayBilas	685200636867133441	2016-01-07T20:45:36	DMoneyKYboy In what endeavor is everyone paid the same? Do Simmons and 9th man play same minutes? Do all coaches make the same? Grow up.
JayBilas	685200335632207872	2016-01-07T20:44:25	JC_Hamilton6 n8rix j_thuey Actually, you are the whiny one. My stance is simple: play if you want. If not, we'll play someone else.
JayBilas	685200131747131393	2016-01-07T20:43:36	DMoneyKYboy I say, let players benefit to value in this multi-billion dollar biz. If it's truly "amateur," stop selling it for billions.
JayBilas	685199857741639680	2016-01-07T20:42:31	DMoneyKYboy No, it's like working there and the company says it's healthy, but you advocate to make it healthy or stop saying that it is.
JayBilas	685199244861542400	2016-01-07T20:40:05	DMoneyKYboy All should earn and make what they can. That's fine. But, allow the players the same benefit. That has always been my position.
JayBilas	685199076883836928	2016-01-07T20:39:24	DMoneyKYboy I'm fine with big business. But, NCAA cannot sell players for billions and call it amateur. It's not. Players deserve more.
JayBilas	685198766853517312	2016-01-07T20:38:11	DMoneyKYboy According to NCAA rhetoric, college sports is over commercialized. They don't live up to what they preach, clearly.
JayBilas	685198574523662336	2016-01-07T20:37:25	DMoneyKYboy Clearly, you don't understand the issues. You are wrong in your analysis of this. WAY wrong.
JayBilas	685198460186955777	2016-01-07T20:36:57	DMoneyKYboy You are conflating issues. I don't advocate NCAA making less. I advocate athletes being allowed to earn to their value.

JayBilas	685186794942509056	2016-01-07T19:50:36	Garrett_13402 DMoneyKYboy Corrupt is a tad strong. But, it's a poorly run organization with bad policies and tons of contradictions.
JayBilas	685186351822680064	2016-01-07T19:48:51	Check out Jack McCallum's terrific article on Jim Boeheim in Sports Illustrated. "It's My Team Again" is truly outstanding. Great piece.
JayBilas	685184288980103168	2016-01-07T19:40:39	DMoneyKYboy The schools know how to educate their students. The NCAA has never educated a single student. It gets in the way a lot.
JayBilas	685184053205688320	2016-01-07T19:39:43	DMoneyKYboy Not fair to put it on the administration that is charged with educating that student? Really? Nah, just silly window dressing.
JayBilas	685182829991428096	2016-01-07T19:34:51	DMoneyKYboy So? Go ahead. His administration can deal with that. Plus, no coach practices to team's detriment. Most are practicing less.
JayBilas	685182402487054336	2016-01-07T19:33:09	efchristensen How do you "keep" a voluntarily decided game? Every team plays the games that are in its interest to play. Not a big deal.
JayBilas	685181907269763072	2016-01-07T19:31:11	DMoneyKYboy Do you really believe teams put in only 20 hours each week? They put in WAY more, and the counting methods are silly.
JayBilas	685181756828454912	2016-01-07T19:30:35	DMoneyKYboy They should be allowed to decide when to practice without any rule. It is a silly rule, unenforced, that is ALWAYS exceeded.
JayBilas	685181555111792641	2016-01-07T19:29:47	DMoneyKYboy I didn't say it was the wrong decision! It shows NCAA can be reasonable for money, but not for other, common sense things.

JayBilas	685180278445338624	2016-01-07T19:24:43	theeZachArnold I couldn't work it out, schedule wise. The pay wasn't too good, either.
JayBilas	685180181045211136	2016-01-07T19:24:19	kylesportsbias Sorry for your loss. I happen to agree that the game was getting too chippy, like UC v. XU did. A break may be a good thing.
JayBilas	685179756057391104	2016-01-07T19:22:38	DMoneyKYboy Please. Waiver of this rule is about money. But, when a player seeks a waiver, too often denied based upon "rules are rules."
JayBilas	685179107190173697	2016-01-07T19:20:03	Mormon_madness1 Yeah, the sport was built on the ol' Utah v. BYU rivalry. Respectfully, the sport transcends all such rivalry games.
JayBilas	685178906685607936	2016-01-07T19:19:16	EPierceVT He couldn't beat me out.
JayBilas	685178838675013632	2016-01-07T19:18:59	NickInThe256 I said perhaps. After a 10 year investigation that uncovered next to nothing, it's fair to question whether bias is present.
JayBilas	685178120849219584	2016-01-07T19:16:08	tomsled63 It was a mistake. It should have been four.
JayBilas	685177971502628864	2016-01-07T19:15:33	kylesportsbias Yes I would. Actually, I just did. It is not that big of a deal.
JayBilas	685177734369308674	2016-01-07T19:14:36	efchristensen Utah may have to pay BYU some money over the cancellation. Otherwise, no, I don't have a problem with it. Just one game.
JayBilas	685177465866719232	2016-01-07T19:13:32	j_thuey Rivalries are great. But, sorry, few outside of Utah will notice. Kansas and Missouri don't play anymore. No national outcry.
JayBilas	685176894229229568	2016-01-07T19:11:16	Rules are rules, except when they're not:  How silly. Just let the schools decide the right balance for themselves.
JayBilas	685175657823924224	2016-01-07T19:06:21	gburnham Mormon_madness1 Yes. I like to watch it, but the world will remain upon its axis. Kentucky and Louisville didn't play for years.
JayBilas	685155210789019648	2016-01-07T17:45:06	Call_Me_LABEy After Penn State, who knows? Notice of Allegations was a bizarre document. NCAA clearly has no jurisdiction, or clue.
JayBilas	685154891849961472	2016-01-07T17:43:50	NickInThe256 Perhaps. Punishments stem from new rule holding coach responsible for everything that happens. No violations by Boeheim.
JayBilas	685149179358887938	2016-01-07T17:21:08	NickInThe256 TEN YEARS and that is all that was found. The punishments were disproportionate to the violations. Period.
JayBilas	685149004632559616	2016-01-07T17:20:26	NickInThe256 There were three issues: drug testing (not a coach issue); one paper by a player (not a coach issue) and jobs of two players.
JayBilas	685148730144747520	2016-01-07T17:19:21	NickInThe256 Pay attention. NCAA found Boeheim did nothing wrong. Rule holds coach responsible. And, you don't even know the violations.
JayBilas	685148498417840128	2016-01-07T17:18:26	Mormon_madness1 Duke and UNC are in same league. They have to play. Utah and BYU play by choice. I have no problem with Utah's decision.
JayBilas	685143279889969153	2016-01-07T16:57:41	NickInThe256 No, it was not. Decided upon appeal, which appeal was too late. Simple issue. Nine games should have started with first game.
JayBilas	685142888402038789	2016-01-07T16:56:08	NickInThe256 Then you don't pay attention. In Syracuse case, coach was exonerated. Investigation flawed, punishment disproportionate.
JayBilas	685136429643644928	2016-01-07T16:30:28	North Carolina's Brice Johnson: 16.8 PPG, 10.6 RPG, 64.5% FG. Last player to reach those marks for a season? Oklahoma's Blake Griffin.
JayBilas	685135831045148673	2016-01-07T16:28:05	NickInThe256 NOT a "decade of violations," but a decade of investigation. There's a big difference. Only a couple of violations, total.
JayBilas	685106077462048768	2016-01-07T14:29:52	JakeDog32819 I was talking about enforcement. It is not enforced, so why have it? There are no need for warnings. Same for delay of game.

JayBilas	683458770060587012	2016-01-03T01:24:03	UA manager Justyn Thomas: Nicknamed "enforcer" from hall monitor days; quick to the ball rack; reminds many of a sedentary DeJuan Blair.
JayBilas	683458008278544385	2016-01-03T01:21:01	ASU manager Corey Littman: Codes all plays for ASU scouting. Still explaining to Bobby Hurley what coding is, and reminding him of his name.

JayBilas	683455017848799233	2016-01-03T01:09:08	Arizona State manager Scott Geerling: Effective with a towel, less so with the ball. A fine dancer, still searching for a willing partner.

JayBilas	683122445214216192	2016-01-02T03:07:37	KousKous228 Take away? Revenues keep rising! Players should be allowed pay, schools can pay what they choose. Pretty simple.
JayBilas	683121897165459457	2016-01-02T03:05:26	WreckEm07 LubbockElitist That makes no sense. TTU is allowed to give a full release. Denying the release is wrong. It's petty, vindictive.
JayBilas	683121454607630336	2016-01-02T03:03:41	NDmbb Wait, Dan the Man ate twenty fruit cups?! Did he have scurvy?
JayBilas	683121089678041088	2016-01-02T03:02:14	Kikuyu09 They can, yes. Nothing to stop any student from making money. The only student restricted in pay is an athlete.
JayBilas	683085401049985027	2016-01-02T00:40:25	LubbockElitist No, we're not. TTU is not right here, period. There is no reasonable justification for the denial of a release. It's petty.
JayBilas	683083119499579394	2016-01-02T00:31:21	KousKous228 Yes. Athletes should be allowed to compete for a piece of the ever-expanding college sports pie. Not hard to understand.
JayBilas	683083047697264640	2016-01-02T00:31:04	LubbockElitist Any restriction of any transfer is wrong, period. That TTU didn't restrict others doesn't make this one right. It's not.
JayBilas	683056155611000832	2016-01-01T22:44:12	Ethan_Vines Greg_D_Walker I agree. That's entirely the point! Contracts are negotiated, protect both sides. Then, a non-compete is fair.
JayBilas	683054820169781248	2016-01-01T22:38:54	JustBeingKing Because these schools have a ton of money, and spend it. The athletes weren't the only ones flown in...it's a free for all.
