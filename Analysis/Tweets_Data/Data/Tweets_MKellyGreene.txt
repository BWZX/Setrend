MKellyGreene	624307887435689984	2015-07-23T19:59:34	Darn you, Delta. I haven't seen my kids in 10 days... And you can't get the computer on the plane to work?

MKellyGreene	611872508397121536	2015-06-19T12:25:48	We so appreciate all your shoutouts for the wsjperfi team. Hopefully our bylines (and paychecks!) will continue at the great WSJ
MKellyGreene	611649747846307842	2015-06-18T21:40:38	Thanks for your support, all. WSJ personal-finance coverage isnâ€™t being eliminated; the rumors of our death have been exaggerated. WSJperfi
MKellyGreene	611650933047455744	2015-06-18T21:45:21	It's a crazy world, this market. We need more smart personal finance voices. Not less. wsjperfi

MKellyGreene	611651338015895553	2015-06-18T21:46:57	@KellyGreeneWSJ DamatoK WSJ jasonzweigwsj why cut WSJpersfinance team when it helps so many people on a weekly basis? wsjperfi sad
MKellyGreene	611651578601308161	2015-06-18T21:47:54	As Americans struggle w/college debt, dubious financial products &amp; paying for old age, WSJ lays off entire personal finance team. wsjperfi
MKellyGreene	611652501117517824	2015-06-18T21:51:34	Cutting the wsj personal finance staff is a huge loss for consumers -- and completely baffling.  wsjperfi
MKellyGreene	611653273485864962	2015-06-18T21:54:39	arguably the need for personal finance has never been greater wsjperfi 
MKellyGreene	611653424535371776	2015-06-18T21:55:15	News is information; but understanding personal finance impacts EVERYONE.  What were you thinking WSJ?  wsjperfi
MKellyGreene	611653910663540736	2015-06-18T21:57:10	WSJpersfinance team the best in the business. The weekend wsj was best issue every week. Period. wsjperfi wsj @KellyGreeneWSJ
MKellyGreene	611655105415356417	2015-06-18T22:01:55	The world needs more personal finance journalism, not less wsjperfi  Very sad to hear the news today.
MKellyGreene	611655724607778816	2015-06-18T22:04:23	.NewsCorp to cut jobs, shift resources to digitalmedia; Some WSJ blogs &amp; overseas bureaus to close wsjperfi 
MKellyGreene	611650152948838400	2015-06-18T21:42:15	Obviously, WSJ personal finance reporters understand the importance of personal finance more than the WSJ does wsjperfi
MKellyGreene	611650398252855296	2015-06-18T21:43:13	WSJ personal finance journalists sent me and others scurrying to play catch-up over and over again. Best wishes to all of them. wsjperfi
MKellyGreene	611650622174162945	2015-06-18T21:44:06	Journoble Probably the same thoughts from when it cut WSJ Sunday. wsjperfi
MKellyGreene	611649035884081152	2015-06-18T21:37:48	Damn. Just heard the news. I just started my career a few years ago... Who am I going to look up to now? The WSJperfi was kickass.
MKellyGreene	611649148543213568	2015-06-18T21:38:15	What a travesty happening at the Journal.  Personal finance is half the reason I read the paper.  All for corporate profits.  wsjperfi

MKellyGreene	611645810875473920	2015-06-18T21:24:59	Until today, I've been proud to be a WSJ Money alum. But after the layoffs of the section's heart -- personal finance staff? wsjperfi
