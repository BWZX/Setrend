dhh	695277454542241792	2016-02-04T16:07:17	There's a difference between rewriting an app from scratch and writing a new app that does the same thing (but in a more modern way)...

dhh	695271245919711232	2016-02-04T15:42:37	thomasfuchs IMO, that defeats a big part of the purpose for Turbolinks. Which is to enable a majestic monolith. One code base, many apps.

dhh	695270874086244352	2016-02-04T15:41:08	ejpbruel React.js raises conceptual overhead by at least an order of magnitude. Turbolinks lets you write old school req/res style + speed.

dhh	693163857590755328	2016-01-29T20:08:36	davewiner That's a technical issue that can be solved. AWS has done well to make lots of hard things easier. Could well see this too.
dhh	693163635993133060	2016-01-29T20:07:43	davewiner Possible. Good to be on guard. It's also possible this actually just is what it says: A move to encrypt the web.
dhh	693163113491865600	2016-01-29T20:05:39	davewiner Anyway. Regardless of disagreement on the HTTPS issue, ✌️👍 to the general fight for the open web.
dhh	693162799082704896	2016-01-29T20:04:24	davewiner I think that has other reasons. But agree with you that Google Readers rise and shutdown hurt RSS (and the open web).
dhh	693162555079049220	2016-01-29T20:03:26	davewiner Maybe. Or maybe the tech industry responds to demand and makes HTTPS easier and cheaper. Like AWS.
dhh	693162282218622977	2016-01-29T20:02:21	davewiner Google doesn't win if the web shrinks. On the contrary. Facebook might win. Medium maybe. Not Google.
dhh	693162144448274433	2016-01-29T20:01:48	davewiner Could happen but I doubt it. It's in Google's general interest to have a big, sprawling web that needs their engine to search.
dhh	693161852524707840	2016-01-29T20:00:38	davewiner Certainly. Lots of important questions to ask of Google and their motives. But on this issue, I see it as a gift to the web.
dhh	693161559460306944	2016-01-29T19:59:28	davewiner And it's well worth asking questions of Google when they're such an important gateway. Just don't think this is the issue.
dhh	693161407030890497	2016-01-29T19:58:52	davewiner IMO the opaque nature of PageRank is far more of a concern for censorship than pushing for an encrypted web.
dhh	693160992574967809	2016-01-29T19:57:13	davewiner Anyway, I support the open web. Encourage people to control their own domains. AND support the push for HTTPS everywhere.
dhh	693160748936208384	2016-01-29T19:56:15	davewiner If Google was cherry picking some sites based on content or whatever, then sure. But this isn't that.
dhh	693160520980025344	2016-01-29T19:55:21	davewiner That's where you lose me. I can't see how nudging and encouraging HTTPS counts as censorship.
dhh	693160215152365568	2016-01-29T19:54:08	davewiner I think that's fair game too. "This Site Is Not Encrypted" is IMO an important security message.
dhh	693159394759045120	2016-01-29T19:50:52	davewiner But I also deeply care about encrypting more of the web. Making it harder to censor and spy on readers in bulk.
dhh	693159263338938368	2016-01-29T19:50:21	davewiner Can't see the comparison here. And I say that as someone who supports the open web and your advocacy for it.
dhh	693159075849359361	2016-01-29T19:49:36	davewiner I don't need to trust Medium since it's all hosted on my domain and easy to export. If they go bad, I can move. Links still OK.
dhh	693158763268829184	2016-01-29T19:48:22	davewiner Google isn't blocking anyone from publishing HTTP sites. It's offering incentive to switch to HTTPS for those who care about PR.
dhh	693158560734248961	2016-01-29T19:47:33	davewiner Google has the power to determine how their search results are computed. PageRank was their choice. So is this.
dhh	693158295356440577	2016-01-29T19:46:30	davewiner If Google required sites to buy HTTPS from them, I could see that argument. But absent of that, I can't.
dhh	693157546522181633	2016-01-29T19:43:31	davewiner Gotcha. Don't think anything should be forced. But I can make good sense of the nudge: HTTPS gets higher priority.
dhh	693157332331687939	2016-01-29T19:42:40	davewiner Curious why you don't consider those concerns to be valid?

dhh	693156505076498432	2016-01-29T19:39:23	davewiner Many good reasons to move to HTTPS including this one:
