HowToSpeakMoney	620174464958005248	2015-07-12T10:14:49	DanielaPetracco Thank you, I'd love that! Follow me and I'll DM my address.
HowToSpeakMoney	617738168553578496	2015-07-05T16:53:51	XboxSupport3 Online seems to work OK. It's just that there is no Guest option.
HowToSpeakMoney	617638385985916928	2015-07-05T10:17:21	XboxSupport3 No.
HowToSpeakMoney	617465948786847748	2015-07-04T22:52:08	XboxSupport3 So just to be crystal clear: on sign-in, 'Who are you?', there is one user only and no Guest option.
HowToSpeakMoney	617463594666565633	2015-07-04T22:42:47	XboxSupport3 Thanks. I've been through that and set up a guest key. My problem is that there is no guest option on the home screen.
HowToSpeakMoney	617431301117755392	2015-07-04T20:34:28	XboxSupport3 Hi! Thanks. It's an Xbox One. The problem is right at the start: there's no Guest option at sign-in.
HowToSpeakMoney	617414969517318144	2015-07-04T19:29:34	BBCNewshour Follow me please so we can DM.
HowToSpeakMoney	617390811576180736	2015-07-04T17:53:34	XboxSupport Hi. I have a shiny new Xbox but the sign-in screen has no option to play as a Guest. Am I doing something wrong?
HowToSpeakMoney	617361343142825984	2015-07-04T15:56:28	ruskin147 hugorodgerbrown My experience has been that it's slower per person but you get through quicker because the queue is shorter.

HowToSpeakMoney	616682866982916097	2015-07-02T19:00:27	Wonderfully prescient piece about Dustin Brown (DreddyTennis, best handle ever) by will_skidelsky: 
HowToSpeakMoney	616502174202339328	2015-07-02T07:02:27	zoesqwilliams Oh right.
HowToSpeakMoney	616497423058386944	2015-07-02T06:43:34	zoesqwilliams I don't know what subtweeting is but it sounds bad. Madrid was fantastic (also not too hot).
HowToSpeakMoney	616382341427150848	2015-07-01T23:06:16	zoesqwilliams Just this minute got back from it. You're not wrong.
HowToSpeakMoney	616188617728368640	2015-07-01T10:16:29	Hottest ever UK day was in August 2003:  Record was 38.4º at Brogdale in Kent. July record: 36.5º at Wisley in 2006.

HowToSpeakMoney	615646895210283008	2015-06-29T22:23:52	charlesarthur Thank you! And I yours. I'm squeal-free, too. (As is Djokovic—he and Federer are the great non-grunters.)
HowToSpeakMoney	615641456078929920	2015-06-29T22:02:15	charlesarthur I have a new system for watching tennis: I support whichever player grunts least or quietest.

HowToSpeakMoney	613318598849896448	2015-06-23T12:12:03	abdutoit Aha! Thank you.
HowToSpeakMoney	613314539652780032	2015-06-23T11:55:55	Wonder if there are data yet about smartphones and pedestrian mortality. Seen 2 people narrowly avoid death just this a.m.
HowToSpeakMoney	609385950872006656	2015-06-12T15:45:07	DarkSkyApp I love your app, but it works less than half the time. The rest it's 'Uh oh...try again later.'
HowToSpeakMoney	607905800930140160	2015-06-08T13:43:31	Not for hipsters.

HowToSpeakMoney	606950303393554433	2015-06-05T22:26:43	DebFriedell I'm planning a binge but it keeps stretching and getting bingier.

HowToSpeakMoney	606862724241489920	2015-06-05T16:38:43	ShaunWilson6 If you run them under a cold tap or plunge them in ice water they're easy to peel—otherwise v v fiddly.
HowToSpeakMoney	606862264793223168	2015-06-05T16:36:53	FrankBath Yolk soft. I'm thinking 90 seconds then cold tap.
HowToSpeakMoney	606847992289763328	2015-06-05T15:40:10	Checking timings for softboiled quail's egg and I'm getting everything from 30 secs to 3.5 minutes. Thanks a lot, internet.
