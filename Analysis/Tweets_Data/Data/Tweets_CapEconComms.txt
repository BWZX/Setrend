CapEconComms	722371479506186241	2016-04-19T10:29:16	Nonetheless, further recovery in industrial metals prices should see silver continue to outperform gold (3/4) 
CapEconComms	722371093651177472	2016-04-19T10:27:44	Surge in silver price also flattered by weakness in USD, which may not be sustained if Fed hikes again soon (2/4) 
CapEconComms	722370689928470528	2016-04-19T10:26:08	Surge in silver price largely a catch-up with where it "should" be given earlier rally in gold (1/4) 
CapEconComms	722339415809515520	2016-04-19T08:21:51	Capital Economics was most accurate forecaster of gold price in Q1. We expect further rally to $1,350 by end-16.

CapEconComms	717008435762561027	2016-04-04T15:18:27	Gold price holding up relatively well given renewed weakness in oil. Our end-16 forecast remains $1,350/oz. 
CapEconComms	717002853131354112	2016-04-04T14:56:16	Some sort of deal to cap oil output still likely, despite Saudi Prince's remarks, but it won't be a game-changer... 
CapEconComms	715929113991757824	2016-04-01T15:49:36	Reported comments from a  Deputy Crown Prince unlikely to be Saudi Arabia's last word on terms of any deal to freeze oil output

CapEconComms	715146045924179969	2016-03-30T11:57:58	Brent crude oil has been stable around $40 since early March, while WTI played catch-up. Both pausing for breath. 
CapEconComms	715140021473386496	2016-03-30T11:34:02	Gold tracking USD closely again in wake of "dovish" comments from Yellen (though in reality she said little new) 
CapEconComms	714838805015052289	2016-03-29T15:37:06	Foundations of recovery in copper price don't yet look strong, but we expect further gains (to $5,500/t) by end-16 
CapEconComms	714727065757622275	2016-03-29T08:13:06	Gold undermined by lower oil prices + stronger USD. Chart against EUR suggests risks to the downside, for now.

CapEconComms	712934829554270208	2016-03-24T09:31:23	ftcommodities Not quite right. IMF point is that oil slump led to higher real interest rates, despite monetary easing. Policy not to blame.
CapEconComms	712680068204666880	2016-03-23T16:39:03	Commodities prices faltering today (largely due to stronger USD), but we still expect further gains this year

CapEconComms	710573211013009409	2016-03-17T21:07:09	We expect gold price to rally to $1,350 this year, as rising inflation offsets Fed hikes. More here 
CapEconComms	710406029968850944	2016-03-17T10:02:50	Gold helped by dovish Fed + weaker USD, but true game-changer has been rebounds in oil + inflation expectations 
CapEconComms	710073306444140545	2016-03-16T12:00:43	Ironore coming back down to earth, but rally still looks overdone. Our end-16 forecast $45/t (with Brent at $45/b) 
CapEconComms	709820332690051072	2016-03-15T19:15:29	OPEC Russia freeze deal might help set floor under oil price, but decent recovery needs cuts in non-OPEC supply + stronger demand (2/2)
CapEconComms	709819982624989184	2016-03-15T19:14:06	We expect OPEC and Russia to agree oil output freeze, but only at high Jan levels and with further increases from Iran and Iraq (1/2)
CapEconComms	709767415228403712	2016-03-15T15:45:13	Quick reminder ahead of FOMC that US rate hikes not necessarily fatal for gold (our end-16 forecast $1,350) ... 
CapEconComms	709761252625661953	2016-03-15T15:20:44	gold under pressure from pre-Fed nerves, firmer US$ + lower oil prices, but same happened before Dec FOMC and was followed by strong rally.
CapEconComms	709448552188088320	2016-03-14T18:38:10	Gold back in favour. We've already revised our forecasts higher (and for silver too):  
CapEconComms	709395159331573760	2016-03-14T15:06:00	Still plenty of upside for ironore, but only if markets forget the poor fundamentals behind past under-performance

CapEconComms	709390799428050944	2016-03-14T14:48:41	gold rally stalls as US real yields edge up again (i.e. less demand both for safe havens + inflation hedges) 
CapEconComms	709387383129690112	2016-03-14T14:35:06	Russia’s apparent acceptance of Iran’s right to raise output is more bullish for oil, suggesting this won’t now be a deal-breaker (2/2)
CapEconComms	709387283707858945	2016-03-14T14:34:42	Brent oil back below $40 as Iran rejects output freeze, but was never likely to miss chance to boost exports after sanctions eased (1/2)

CapEconComms	707974246094540800	2016-03-10T16:59:48	Lessons from ECB (2/2): instead, response of gold depends on the impact on other asset prices, especially equities, and the dollar.
CapEconComms	707974178754924544	2016-03-10T16:59:32	Lessons from reaction to ECB (1/2): interest rate cuts alone not enough to boost gold price, even if they take rates further below zero.
CapEconComms	707966050596478976	2016-03-10T16:27:14	Key driver of gold rally has been rebound in US inflation expectations (not negative interest rates) (2/2)

CapEconComms	707873558433812481	2016-03-10T10:19:42	Iron ore prices coming off the boil. Fundamentals still among the most bearish of any commodity - we remain wary.

CapEconComms	705708491994959872	2016-03-04T10:56:30	Gold taking the headlines today, but silver poised to catch up and outperform? More here  
CapEconComms	705706813812035584	2016-03-04T10:49:50	Relationship far from perfect, but no coincidence that US inflation expectations + gold price both now taking off 
CapEconComms	705440307505188870	2016-03-03T17:10:50	... and lots of room for silver to outperform gold (3/3). Our end-17 forecast for silver: $18 (with upside risks)

CapEconComms	705438308663484416	2016-03-03T17:02:53	Recent fall in silver price can be explained by fading safe-haven demand and rising US rate expectations ... (1/3) 
CapEconComms	705077839226388480	2016-03-02T17:10:31	A few close calls in Feb but Brent oil has now been above $30 for more than 5 weeks. Our end-16 forecast: $45. 
CapEconComms	705019625499713536	2016-03-02T13:19:12	Silver left behind as gold and industrial metals rally, but hard to see this underperformance being sustained.

CapEconComms	705012768051732480	2016-03-02T12:51:57	One good explanation for resilience of gold is returning demand for inflation hedges, seen also in TIPS yields... 
CapEconComms	705012091980292096	2016-03-02T12:49:15	Gold surprisingly resilient given fading safe-haven demand, reflected in higher yields (see chart), equities + US$ 
CapEconComms	704560808634785793	2016-03-01T06:56:01	Industrial metals weaken on soft China PMIs, but downside limited by further PBOC easing. PMI perhaps also distorted by New Year timing.

CapEconComms	702525039917326336	2016-02-24T16:06:36	Gloomy headlines on oil prices today, but bigger picture is still that Brent is holding above $30. Floor forming? 
CapEconComms	702501625655652356	2016-02-24T14:33:34	Rally in ironore price (back above $50/tonne) seems premature. We expect near-term correction (to $45). More here  
CapEconComms	702414768766902272	2016-02-24T08:48:25	Fall in oil prices on OPEC comments looks overdone. Output freeze was always an alternative to cuts, and Iran never likely to join anyway.
CapEconComms	702148731173474304	2016-02-23T15:11:17	Falling steel production should remove some of the global oversupply, but not enough to boost prices significantly 
CapEconComms	701782693269340160	2016-02-22T14:56:47	Latest sentixsurvey shows improvement in investor sentiment towards commodities. Still low, but bottoming out? 
CapEconComms	701779864509136896	2016-02-22T14:45:32	Still volatile but oil prices appear to be finding a floor at last. Our end-16 forecasts for Brent WTI both $45.

CapEconComms	699630610365747201	2016-02-16T16:25:10	Oil price gives up all its gains on OPEC Russia oildeal: markets want outright cuts in output, not just a freeze at current high levels.
CapEconComms	699596950388219907	2016-02-16T14:11:25	One of many flaws in the oildeal: even if OPEC Russia freeze output now, it would be at a relatively high level 
CapEconComms	699587601762816001	2016-02-16T13:34:16	We continue to expect oil to be back at $45 by year-end, but this isn't based on OPEC Russia oildeal. More here  
CapEconComms	699528155971903488	2016-02-16T09:38:03	OPEC oil deal not worth much: Iran hasn't yet signed up, Russia compliance doubtful, freeze at Jan level would just maintain excess supply
CapEconComms	699163947858010113	2016-02-15T09:30:49	Gold price also appears to have overshot based on level of US dollar against other major currencies e.g. EUR 
CapEconComms	699161754245459968	2016-02-15T09:22:06	Gold price vulnerable to further correction: $1,150 looks more reasonable given level of short-term US bond yields 
CapEconComms	698085183283720192	2016-02-12T10:04:12	A crumb of comfort. Despite global turmoil, Brent oil still above its Jan lows (even allowing for US$ weakness). 
CapEconComms	697086701387313152	2016-02-09T15:56:35	Oil price down again, but would have fallen even further in last few days had it not been for weakness of US$. 
CapEconComms	697002048873766912	2016-02-09T10:20:12	oil prices might indeed fall as low as $20 in short term, but key point is that they wouldn't stay there very long 
CapEconComms	696994547809808384	2016-02-09T09:50:24	Near-term upside for gold now looks limited, unless you believe Fed rate expectations can fall even further 
CapEconComms	696698872945623040	2016-02-08T14:15:30	Fact that Iran wants payments for oil in euro reflects continuing US financial sanctions and is nothing new. No wider significance.
CapEconComms	695644494885220354	2016-02-05T16:25:46	We expect the tin price to rally to $17,000 per tonne by end-2016, from around $15,080 today. Full note here

CapEconComms	692758235229593600	2016-01-28T17:16:48	Falling US supply + rising global demand should still mean that oil price will recover later this year, even without OPEC Russia deal.

CapEconComms	692626957280940032	2016-01-28T08:35:09	Hopes of OPEC-Russia deal shaky foundation for oil price recovery. Our end-16 forecast of $45 based instead on US cuts + stronger demand.

CapEconComms	689076620875952128	2016-01-18T13:27:23	Extra oil supply after lifting of IranSanctions Irandeal likely to be much less than that from Iraq last year 
CapEconComms	688669499504078848	2016-01-17T10:29:38	IranDeal IranSanctions not a game-changer. 1. Widely expected and surely already reflected in low oil price (1/2) 
CapEconComms	688669300375293952	2016-01-17T10:28:50	2. Iran had still been selling oil mainly to Asia. Extra 2016 supply to be less than from Iraq in 2015 + part offset by non-OPEC cuts (2/2)
CapEconComms	688665088966930433	2016-01-17T10:12:06	This would only be 1/3 of the increase from Iraq in last year or so, and offset by lower non-OPEC supply? IranDeal

CapEconComms	688008985614630912	2016-01-15T14:44:59	Lifting of IranSanctions surely already reflected by now in low oil price, and increasingly likely to be offset by cuts in non-OPEC supply
CapEconComms	688002640949735424	2016-01-15T14:19:46	How low could oil go? US supply cuts will accelerate below $25, and talk of $10 make little sense. Full note here

CapEconComms	684697728669093888	2016-01-06T11:27:14	Safe haven demand, return of inflation and recovery in emerging economies should lift gold price further this year. 
CapEconComms	684679857209487360	2016-01-06T10:16:13	Gold edging higher on (dubious) N Korea h-bomb test. Increased demand for safe havens and inflation hedges to lift gold to $1250 this year.

CapEconComms	684053276032122881	2016-01-04T16:46:24	Not clear Saudi-Iran tensions should mean higher oil price: Saudi might now be even less willing to cut its output if this would help Iran.

CapEconComms	678865467839143937	2015-12-21T09:11:54	Copper still weak, but appears to have found a floor around $4,500/tonne despite further fall in oil price. 
CapEconComms	677813422218702848	2015-12-18T11:31:27	rareearths prices already showing signs of stabilising and set to recover in 2016. Our latest take here 
CapEconComms	677531108066504704	2015-12-17T16:49:38	US edging towards easing remaining restrictions on oil exports, but not as big a deal as it sounds. Full note here 
CapEconComms	677510067403554818	2015-12-17T15:26:02	Gold down 2% today in belated reaction to Fed, but that's not actually so bad considering jump in bond yields 
CapEconComms	677223730096029702	2015-12-16T20:28:14	oil prices down again today, but just to stress its not due to the Fed. Markets rattled instead by earlier news of jump in US stocks.
CapEconComms	677219850180251649	2015-12-16T20:12:49	Commodities largely shrug off Fed hike: metals including gold silver up on slightly weaker dollar, oil and grains down on ample supply
CapEconComms	677159591235440642	2015-12-16T16:13:22	We expect further, albeit limited, recovery in sugar price in 2016. Full note here 
CapEconComms	677155544260599809	2015-12-16T15:57:17	Gold (+ silver) up despite jump in US short-term bond yields. Supports our positive view on both metals in 2016.

CapEconComms	676752740866007040	2015-12-15T13:16:41	Unless short-term yields surge on first Fed rate hike (surely priced in?), gold should find a floor above $1,000. 
CapEconComms	674988751207211008	2015-12-10T16:27:13	Supply cuts beginning to stabilise prices of industrial commodities, but meaningful recovery will need better news on demand (ie. China)
