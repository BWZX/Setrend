ryan	720466088639774721	2016-04-14T04:17:55	ethank eh, that's a broad statement. Bots will be better than apps at some things, just like apps were better than the web at some things.

ryan	720298110275031041	2016-04-13T17:10:26	Bot discoverability in Messenger is basically zero right now, and that needle won't move without curation, search, and directory lists. 🔎🤖
ryan	720297393682427904	2016-04-13T17:07:35	It's day two, yes, but I am certain that the biggest existential threat to bots in Messenger rn will be the lack of a store/directory.
ryan	720276428407701505	2016-04-13T15:44:17	BenedictEvans I'd argue that's software/design deficiency, not a model/platform prob. Always rough edges in early software on new platforms
ryan	720274465397997569	2016-04-13T15:36:29	peterrojas EspionageStudio oh yes, definitely made my feeings known re 16GB phones in 2015/16!

ryan	710598267617148928	2016-03-17T22:46:43	llkats correct answer is "How much you got?"
ryan	710583155640512512	2016-03-17T21:46:40	sacca -- in fact I literally spent minutes debating with myself whether to even send that tweet. It was like that.
ryan	710582958000713728	2016-03-17T21:45:53	sacca never do that, and on one occasion it resulted in a string of harassing messages that nearly prompted a restraining order

ryan	710569240579837952	2016-03-17T20:51:23	amanda_machina khaydensafdie truth! Still, I'd intuit that introversion doesn't strongly correlate to survey response rate, yeah?
ryan	710568231497371648	2016-03-17T20:47:22	SteveCotner you know, correlation != causation etc etc ✌️
ryan	710568070251589633	2016-03-17T20:46:44	SteveCotner feel free to fwd as an attachment and we can check the headers if you require proof. But I can guarantee 150% that it's not us.
ryan	710561470086385664	2016-03-17T20:20:30	SteveCotner are you sure it came from us? If so how? Maybe forward the message to me (as attachment)? Email on my site.
ryan	710561342726377473	2016-03-17T20:20:00	SteveCotner hmm, that makes no sense. Those emails are stored in a secured AWS database and no tools or systems have access to it.
ryan	710549526549962752	2016-03-17T19:33:03	khaydensafdie yeah, totally agree. So it's disappointing no matter how you cut it.

ryan	704522057908776960	2016-03-01T04:22:02	jaykirsch killing off tools that enable positive team-network effects strikes me as an anti-pattern ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

ryan	704517440709873664	2016-03-01T04:03:41	Reducing communication with your team to be "more productive" is to teamwork as fasting is to losing weight.
ryan	704517244051595264	2016-03-01T04:02:54	Good communication is hard, takes time and commitment, and doesn't always seem to have immediate benefits. It's a skill and behavior.
ryan	704516940878860289	2016-03-01T04:01:42	Arguing against team chat is in essence arguing against team communication. Protip: the worst teams communicate far less than the best ones.

ryan	703251206219534338	2016-02-26T16:12:07	Still, I think particular focus on speeds and feeds is dumb when evaluating products. The real value here is that better wifi &gt; faster wifi.
