SamAntar	725048742244679680	2016-04-26T19:47:45	GAAP has unfortunately evolved from economic substance over legal form to legal form over economic substance, or worse, no substance.

SamAntar	725047322632159232	2016-04-26T19:42:07	Non-GAAP is the tail wagging the dog. GAAP, the dog, is full of fleas. Look at timeshare revenue accounting rules and WHO wrote them.
SamAntar	725046020376244227	2016-04-26T19:36:56	The real problem is GAAP that by design doesn't accurately reflect economic substance of transactions. Non-GAAP is pimple on horse's ass.
