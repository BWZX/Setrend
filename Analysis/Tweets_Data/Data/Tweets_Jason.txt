Jason	705061913479090176	2016-03-02T16:07:14	DMCFutures polly correct, yelp well within the law / their rights (it seems)
Jason	705061752287825920	2016-03-02T16:06:35	usedtobethere inside Lons plan is to send a 'here is what you're missing... ' and if folks open it, pull them back over :-)
Jason	705061606925840384	2016-03-02T16:06:01	usedtobethere inside Lons we wanted to only get to the top 10% of the list who loved it, so we knew we might lose some interested folks
Jason	705059748090028033	2016-03-02T15:58:37	in house sales is a grind -- numbers game. The term boiler room exists for this reason: It's miserable at times

Jason	704989995698884608	2016-03-02T11:21:27	Thanks to jason for creating a great startup Launch conference!  
Jason	705058268310179840	2016-03-02T15:52:45	polly there are valid reasons to miss 10 of your first 59 days at work (medical, death in family, etc)my guess is some other issues at work
Jason	705057780349030400	2016-03-02T15:50:48	First sentence in her post should have said 'I missed 10 of my 59 days at work, but I shouldn't have been fired'  
Jason	705057140260515840	2016-03-02T15:48:16	polly that is most conservative position employers are told to take, but it is not the only option. Yelp does open itself up to lawsuit
Jason	705056689226035200	2016-03-02T15:46:28	jaredcosulich we can't know, we have partial information
Jason	705056590047514625	2016-03-02T15:46:05	SoroushG_ Yelp if she attacks publicly she opened the box -- they have to tell their side I think.
Jason	705056258470969344	2016-03-02T15:44:45	Love it!  
Jason	705056116812546051	2016-03-02T15:44:12	Hard situation, but women outlined her missed days publicly -- Yelp only confirmed the denominator it seems, no? 
Jason	705055754160467968	2016-03-02T15:42:45	5/Yelp needs to ship these low base pay jobs heck out of SF &amp; people need to not take them (unless its second income for their family)
Jason	705055423796129792	2016-03-02T15:41:26	4/of course this person made some bad decisions, has to take responsibility; however, I'm in awe of single mothers &amp; their challenges üí∞üçºüí™üí™
Jason	705054648109891585	2016-03-02T15:38:22	3/none of us can know for sure what truth is--we have partial information; insane rent continues to be central issue (was she in SF of AZ?)
Jason	705053971623202816	2016-03-02T15:35:40	2/worker blogs details, seems like bad luck &amp; a hard life: $2500 rent $2k base pay, took out insane 300% loan 
Jason	705053247044628481	2016-03-02T15:32:48	1/A yelp worker (&amp;single mom) says they have a string of bad luck, misses 10 of first 59 work days--yelp terminates

Jason	701165254215016448	2016-02-20T22:03:18	Lons drivers and caregivers in SF now $20-35 an hour actually! Rates are insane... Baby sitters are 20 -25 an hour
Jason	701164942842425344	2016-02-20T22:02:04	Lons it's not blame poor or blame companies for entry level jobs -- it's bizarre real estate condition in SF. As if LA had half the homes!
Jason	701164629364383744	2016-02-20T22:00:49	Lons not just coding, but marketing, writing, video editing, sales, etc -- all courses online &amp; $20-40 an hour skills easily

Jason	701164129508159488	2016-02-20T21:58:50	Lons we said the same thing about Manhattan on the 90s... And we lost... And Brooklyn won.
Jason	701161584760983552	2016-02-20T21:48:43	pocarles yeah, it's a bizarre real estate issue in SF, which refuses to build more homes or a mass transit system
Jason	701161309761441792	2016-02-20T21:47:37	bdesarnauts exactly
Jason	701161223958573057	2016-02-20T21:47:17	robmerki JFulfordtheIII I think people in cafes in SF make $15-20 an hour actually. many have benefits too... thus, $4.50 for coffee
Jason	701161038113165312	2016-02-20T21:46:33	robmerki living wage in Paris, Hong Kong, SF and Manhattan is the issue. When rent is $1,500 a month living wage is... boom!

Jason	701160391397609474	2016-02-20T21:43:58	Theremina I'm the luckiest guy on the planet, for sure.... but I did start at minimum wage and fought like a rabid dog to get to $15 an hr
Jason	701160039717834752	2016-02-20T21:42:35	pocarles I'm sympathetic to how much it sucks to start at the bottom.... because I did.
Jason	701159256431599616	2016-02-20T21:39:28	jfornear really? where?
Jason	701159120481615873	2016-02-20T21:38:55	TheRealMrG if you want to attack your boss in public, well, you broke every single agreement you signed on the way in--you know that.
Jason	701158814544896000	2016-02-20T21:37:42	11/If those sites existed in the 80s and 90s I would have been F@#%$ing Larry Page!!!! I had to save up and buy books every 3 months
Jason	701158598961856512	2016-02-20T21:36:51	10/Today there are countless free and $20 a month sites where you can learn amazing skills. I WISH I had udacity coursera coming up!
Jason	701158436600307712	2016-02-20T21:36:12	9/I was pissed of that I got paid so little when I started... so I added skills all night long reading books about computer networking.
Jason	701158261924364288	2016-02-20T21:35:31	8/slamming your boss on Medium is a great way to get attention, but treehouse lynda &amp; countless other sites provide a better path IMO
Jason	701158041366835200	2016-02-20T21:34:38	8/sucks to start your career at the bottom, but if you learn skill, apply yourself you can rise up &amp; increase your hourly rate quickly.
Jason	701157750462500864	2016-02-20T21:33:29	7/I used my anger at making $3.50 an hour to push myself to $5, $8, $10, 15 &amp; then $100 from 18 to 30 yrs old.

Jason	701156355877445633	2016-02-20T21:27:56	5/Situation in Bay Area is MUCH worse than back then! 160 hours of work = $1,600 -- before taxes = impossible to make work.
Jason	701156064528453632	2016-02-20T21:26:47	4/When I made $3.50 then $5 and eventually $10 an hour in NYC I had $350 a month rent in Brooklyn (studio). 60-90 minutes on train each way!
Jason	701155895653216257	2016-02-20T21:26:07	3/No company can solve for ABSURD $1,500 rents around SF (let alone $4,000 rents *in* SF) for people who make minimum wage. I made $3.50hr
Jason	701155308920393728	2016-02-20T21:23:47	2/Clearly you can't have entry-level jobs in San Francisco (or Manhattan, Hong Kong) any more. It's just not possible given costs.

Jason	683715831566487552	2016-01-03T18:25:31	danprimack Jason 8) during NYE you can have less than 5% of cars available w/ 1000's of cars getting dispatched or becoming avail each min
Jason	683713619264065536	2016-01-03T18:16:44	travisk danprimack the interesting thing about suburbs is they had no service many days; you had to book a car days/weeks in advance!
Jason	683713211611267072	2016-01-03T18:15:07	danprimack Jason 4) in burbs w/ less liquidity, if 1st driver doesn't accept request, then likely next closest driver is further away

Jason	683711778988032000	2016-01-03T18:09:25	danprimack Jason 3) sometimes you get car that ends up further away than original closest car, sometimes you get closer car than original
Jason	683711276753682433	2016-01-03T18:07:25	danprimack Jason 2) highly likely the cars you see when you request are matched before your request is even processed

Jason	683710820765679617	2016-01-03T18:05:37	danprimack Jason 1) during busy times 90%+ of all cars are being dispatched to at any given moment w/ 1000's of requests fulfilled/min..
Jason	683710730667868162	2016-01-03T18:05:15	ElissaBeth alex Uber maybe people only remember when it's wrong? It seems wildly accurate to me.. For an estimate in the real world!
