StuPolitics	708121849205559297	2016-03-11T02:46:19	Trump still displays no understanding of checks and balances. He seems not to understand the role and authority of Congress.

StuPolitics	707405229227175937	2016-03-09T03:18:44	It's time to dispel this notion that realDonaldTrump doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing

StuPolitics	705588054128521216	2016-03-04T02:57:55	Cruz is still having a nice debate, if it matters. 
StuPolitics	705587898016518147	2016-03-04T02:57:18	Kasich pulling ahead in the race among "foreign affairs experts." Not so much among Republican primary voters and caucus attendees.
StuPolitics	705586783724183552	2016-03-04T02:52:53	On the soon-to-be-established Trump TV Network. 
StuPolitics	705586617218682880	2016-03-04T02:52:13	"If I say do it, they are gonna do it."
StuPolitics	705585852559142916	2016-03-04T02:49:11	Kasich brings back his best weapon: I was on a committee.
StuPolitics	705585547260116992	2016-03-04T02:47:58	Kasich clearly is still trying to be the grown-up in the debate, and in the race, but it hasn't worked yet.
StuPolitics	705583982411255808	2016-03-04T02:41:45	Trump says he is changing his position, will endorse visas for highly skilled.
StuPolitics	705583331736481793	2016-03-04T02:39:10	I sort of wish Lindsey Graham and Ben Carson were in this debate. I miss them.
StuPolitics	705582223140003840	2016-03-04T02:34:45	Trump says it wouldn't be fair for him to release his own off-the-record comments. Wouldn't be fair to whom?
StuPolitics	705581373839548417	2016-03-04T02:31:23	Cruz really landing some punches on Trump tonight.
StuPolitics	705580973908496386	2016-03-04T02:29:47	A good first half hour for Cruz and Kasich
StuPolitics	705580753116119040	2016-03-04T02:28:55	"exploding jobs."
StuPolitics	705580577462870016	2016-03-04T02:28:13	Trump is going to united the country. Sure, that makes sense. We can all call each other names.
StuPolitics	705579647094886400	2016-03-04T02:24:31	Absolutely. 
StuPolitics	705579318869512193	2016-03-04T02:23:13	Chris Wallace to Trump: "Your numbers don't add up, sir"
StuPolitics	705495204543922176	2016-03-03T20:48:58	Given everything that has happened this cycle, "strange" now seems very reasonable. 
StuPolitics	705488687245582336	2016-03-03T20:23:05	Seems like a reasonable comment from a reasonable person. 
StuPolitics	705482499552624640	2016-03-03T19:58:29	This --&gt; 
StuPolitics	705449775563296768	2016-03-03T17:48:27	Romney gave plenty of fodder to tonight's Fox debate moderators, if they needed it.
StuPolitics	705446645383692290	2016-03-03T17:36:01	The supercilious and snide sniping at Romney is stupid. A good speech, helpful to the cause. I admire Romney for stepping up.
StuPolitics	705448246429270017	2016-03-03T17:42:23	Save Maine (if Trump somehow gets over 50%) or Puerto Rico (same w/ Rubio), unlikely anyone will build a large delegate lead this weekend.
StuPolitics	705447894556528640	2016-03-03T17:40:59	So 2012 Republican nominee has portrayed favorite to become 2016 Republican nominee as immoral, incompetent, dishonest, dangerous, and dumb.
StuPolitics	705446469914857472	2016-03-03T17:35:19	Hearing a lot of this talk these days. 
StuPolitics	705445615451447296	2016-03-03T17:31:55	More evidence Carson departure isn't nec a boost for Cruz  (plus polling shows most Carson voters go to Rubio)
StuPolitics	705440380041302016	2016-03-03T17:11:07	Or both 
StuPolitics	705436523517353984	2016-03-03T16:55:48	What is striking is that Mitt Romney just endorsed the anyone-but-Trump strategy, which leads to a contested convention
StuPolitics	705141153998487552	2016-03-02T21:22:06	Updated GOP Super Tuesday delegate totals:  Trump 243 Cruz 220 Rubio 101 Kasich 21 Carson 3
StuPolitics	705117014805729280	2016-03-02T19:46:11	If so, pretty pathetic.

StuPolitics	705097623217176576	2016-03-02T18:29:08	The answer is almost certainly no. Now can we move on to a serious question? 
StuPolitics	705090760853561345	2016-03-02T18:01:51	If Trump is the GOP nominee, will you support him? I asked MA Gov Charlie Baker. You might be surprised by answer 
StuPolitics	705087962871111680	2016-03-02T17:50:44	If you had told me 6 months ago that Rubio would get more votes across SC-VA-GA-TN-AL-AR than Cruz, I'd have bet the farm Cruz was done.
StuPolitics	705081461901283328	2016-03-02T17:24:54	Thank God for baseball.  
StuPolitics	705082514457677826	2016-03-02T17:29:05	Chris Christie is awkwardly adapting to a new role: Donald Trump’s yes man  
StuPolitics	704916591948009477	2016-03-02T06:29:46	Obviously. Is there an argument about that? 
StuPolitics	704888088745488388	2016-03-02T04:36:31	Only one or two delegates, Chuck. 
StuPolitics	704885230465716224	2016-03-02T04:25:09	All the folks on TV tonight who said Rubio has not won a contest are invited to revise their remarks. 
StuPolitics	704884337917825024	2016-03-02T04:21:36	That won't stop Jake Tapper from saying that Rubio was shut out. 
StuPolitics	704877718148661250	2016-03-02T03:55:18	So Trump only winning betw 6-8 of 11 primaries/caucuses. Good night, but far from a Trump tsunami. 
StuPolitics	704865772812763136	2016-03-02T03:07:50	Just amazing: Trump says he's sure he'll get along with SpeakerRyan. But "if I don’t, he’s going to have to pay a big price, OK?"
StuPolitics	704864201257267200	2016-03-02T03:01:35	The more Trump talks, the more bizarre he sounds.
StuPolitics	704863705977266176	2016-03-02T02:59:37	Cruz beating his polls by 4-5 points tonight, Rubio by about 2 points, Trump about even. 
StuPolitics	704863114290991105	2016-03-02T02:57:16	10% in for MN and Rubio leads Cruz 36-28, Trump at 21%. Rubio may win a state after all!  SuperTuesday

StuPolitics	704861623626825730	2016-03-02T02:51:21	Listening to Trump tonight, would you really exit the GOP race if you were Cruz, Rubio or Kasich? I don't think so.
StuPolitics	704861389286813698	2016-03-02T02:50:25	Christie looking more and more confused.
StuPolitics	704861053092388868	2016-03-02T02:49:05	"An easy race" against HRC, says Trump.
StuPolitics	704860827778613248	2016-03-02T02:48:11	To Trump, there are amazing states and, I dunno, unamazing states?
StuPolitics	704860382469292033	2016-03-02T02:46:25	Christie still looks like he is in a coma.
StuPolitics	704859440323829761	2016-03-02T02:42:40	That is his base. 
StuPolitics	704859191672860673	2016-03-02T02:41:41	Trump, as gracious as ever. That's the way he is going to unite the GOP.
StuPolitics	704859062605709312	2016-03-02T02:41:10	If they think he will lose FL, that would change their thinking obviously.  But that is still a big if. 
StuPolitics	704858525059538944	2016-03-02T02:39:02	Chris Christie says Donald Trump is bringing his party together. And I am the King of England.
StuPolitics	704858250731085824	2016-03-02T02:37:57	I have often thought the same thing. 
StuPolitics	704858107839578113	2016-03-02T02:37:23	I can't imagine Rubio will get out before March 15. 
StuPolitics	704857191388319744	2016-03-02T02:33:44	Interesting. 
StuPolitics	704854492680888320	2016-03-02T02:23:01	"It's looking better..." What exactly is "it?" Not the race for the Republican nomination.  
StuPolitics	704853824444325888	2016-03-02T02:20:21	CNN predicts the New York Yankees will win the American League East. Oh, sorry. I got confused.
StuPolitics	704852048215306240	2016-03-02T02:13:18	Except for the fact that soon the GOP race will move north and then east. 
StuPolitics	704851377999126528	2016-03-02T02:10:38	CBS just called OK for Cruz. That's big.
StuPolitics	704851276022960129	2016-03-02T02:10:14	Yes, UpshotNYT is worth checking out. Evaluates Super Tuesday on the basis of the delegate count.
StuPolitics	704849824831533057	2016-03-02T02:04:28	Exactly. 
StuPolitics	704849316234469377	2016-03-02T02:02:27	Hillary not exactly playing to the middle yet.
StuPolitics	704846306359967744	2016-03-02T01:50:29	I'd like to see estimates of delegates won. Of course, we aren't getting that.
StuPolitics	704845842969133056	2016-03-02T01:48:39	And now NBC calls VA for Trump. Rubio weeps.
StuPolitics	704845570922323968	2016-03-02T01:47:34	Virginia exit polls show JohnKasich pulling almost all of his votes from college/postgrad, same as Rubio. Almost all 50K+, like Rubio. 1/2
StuPolitics	704843346959667200	2016-03-02T01:38:43	Trump currently at 28% in TX, 37% in VA, 33% in VT, 33% in OK. Winning big (over 40%) in TN, MA and GA. Opposition still divided.
StuPolitics	704839533959864320	2016-03-02T01:23:34	natebyer Thanks. But they won't after what I have said about them. Still, it's nice to be able to tell the truth.
StuPolitics	704838230961553408	2016-03-02T01:18:24	The "base" of the Republican Party includes upscale suburban voters who always vote Republican, as well as evangelicals.
StuPolitics	704835815122169857	2016-03-02T01:08:48	CNN says Republican voters want an outsider. I had not heard that before.
StuPolitics	704835620342894592	2016-03-02T01:08:01	This would be significant, I would think. 
StuPolitics	704834384520581121	2016-03-02T01:03:07	CNN still doing the "win" baloney, as if every race is winner-take-all. They should know better.
StuPolitics	704832044761677824	2016-03-02T00:53:49	But you can drink the soup. Just be sure you salt it. 
StuPolitics	704830637283385344	2016-03-02T00:48:13	Right now Trump easily winning rural VA, while metro Richmond close. Not much out of NOVA or Hampton Roads SuperTuesday

StuPolitics	704828108042477568	2016-03-02T00:38:10	Useful. 
StuPolitics	704827426992320512	2016-03-02T00:35:28	Given the early results tonight, Bernie is looking more than a bit delusional.

StuPolitics	704825684909121536	2016-03-02T00:28:32	Information. 
StuPolitics	704825514347749376	2016-03-02T00:27:52	CNN makes a big deal about who "wins" states even though the race is about delegates. Margins matter, but you rarely hear that.
StuPolitics	704820762885001216	2016-03-02T00:08:59	There are Republicans in Vermont? Who knew?

StuPolitics	703792987239800832	2016-02-28T04:04:58	I have a new column coming in the morning -- about Cruz &amp; Kasich scenarios and Rubio's prospects re: stopping Trump.
StuPolitics	703783502760677377	2016-02-28T03:27:17	This was a winding, 55 minute speech from Sanders tonight in Minnesota.  Mentions of South Carolina: 0.
StuPolitics	703781269226782721	2016-02-28T03:18:24	I would have thought someone in GovChristie's camp would have resigned in the last 24 hours. It seems he chose his team well.

StuPolitics	703731661591207937	2016-02-28T00:01:17	CNN projects that HillaryClinton wins the South Carolina Democratic primary. 
StuPolitics	703731604372455424	2016-02-28T00:01:03	Pretty obvious he will get out. Unlike Kasich, he is going after Trump. Why isn't Kasich doing the same thing? 
StuPolitics	703710921416380416	2016-02-27T22:38:52	Here are MarcoRubio's tax returns. Where are realDonaldTrump's? 
StuPolitics	703661598607613952	2016-02-27T19:22:53	Very tight Rubio messaging today -- big crowds, Trump as con man -- seems designed to crack the endless coverage Trump gets.

StuPolitics	703682471121068032	2016-02-27T20:45:49	Trump certainly has a path to the nomination. But I would not call it clear.  
StuPolitics	703681005572497409	2016-02-27T20:40:00	The big question is whether Rubio's blistering attacks on Trump have turned the GOP contest into a 2-man race in the eyes of most voters.

StuPolitics	703039553574195201	2016-02-26T02:11:06	So, is it good or bad that Kasich and that other guy are not getting to talk?
StuPolitics	703039375987318785	2016-02-26T02:10:23	Well, you can't say that Rubio is holding back tonight.

StuPolitics	702302155991027712	2016-02-24T01:20:56	Sanders plays the "obstructionism" card. Always a smart idea with a Democratic audience. Unfortunately, Joe Biden trumps everything.

StuPolitics	696167468784578560	2016-02-07T03:03:53	Shocking. You really think viewers can have their own opinions?  
StuPolitics	696167263804776448	2016-02-07T03:03:04	Most Rs think Obama is smart and knows what he is doing. They don't think he's an idiot.

StuPolitics	695455947574153217	2016-02-05T03:56:33	HRC on a roll now....
StuPolitics	695455272400220160	2016-02-05T03:53:52	I had a dog when I was young. A Boston Bull Terrior named Nipper. She died. No dog since then. My kids had a frog. 
StuPolitics	695454601068310528	2016-02-05T03:51:12	Nope. She wisely took the hit and let the debate move on.
StuPolitics	695454454238281728	2016-02-05T03:50:37	Look how comfortable Bernie is on this trade question. Will HRC respond?
StuPolitics	695453658293653504	2016-02-05T03:47:27	NAFTA. She was for it before she was against it. Ditto TPP. Good question by Chuck.
StuPolitics	695453357096505344	2016-02-05T03:46:15	Seriously? hardly Tref. 
StuPolitics	695453001893281793	2016-02-05T03:44:51	Key moment: HRC with her usual nod of agreement and Bernie with a side to side disgust head shake. Both on the Flint, Mi question.
StuPolitics	695452166954180608	2016-02-05T03:41:32	5 or 6 Pinocchios, at least. Maybe more. 
StuPolitics	695451747301642240	2016-02-05T03:39:52	Charlie Holt used to be the hockey coach at UNH. He was great. UNH stole him from Colby.
StuPolitics	695451474000621569	2016-02-05T03:38:46	The answer might be in Lech Lecha. Then again, it might not be there. What's the question? 
StuPolitics	695450926069452801	2016-02-05T03:36:36	Barbara Jordan. What a voice. If you are too young to remember her, you missed something!
StuPolitics	695450780371791872	2016-02-05T03:36:01	No? What an obvious response to Maddow's question. Smart, but obvious.
StuPolitics	695450575169851392	2016-02-05T03:35:12	I can't believe that Sanders is at all vulnerable on this. The title of the ad? Give me a break....

StuPolitics	695446547333382146	2016-02-05T03:19:12	Koch brothers. Always a winning mention in a Democratic debate. Kind of like George Soros in a GOP debate.
StuPolitics	695446318630641664	2016-02-05T03:18:17	Hillary really does have the head nodding in agreement thing going tonight.
StuPolitics	695446009074155522	2016-02-05T03:17:03	Sanders is best when he is talking about Hillary's connections to Wall Street and her Super PAC money and allies.
StuPolitics	695445569464995841	2016-02-05T03:15:19	NATO. Rarely mentioned in a Democratic debate. Hell, in any debate.

StuPolitics	695445218779246594	2016-02-05T03:13:55	Bernie: "North Korea is a strange country." Sounds like something Donald Trump would say.
StuPolitics	695444518515019776	2016-02-05T03:11:08	Reality is that Sanders foreign policy worldview is closer to Obama's than Clinton.
StuPolitics	695444739277979648	2016-02-05T03:12:01	Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker to endorse Chris Christie. 
StuPolitics	695444095041277953	2016-02-05T03:09:27	Hillary has the nervous smile down pat.

StuPolitics	695443628643094528	2016-02-05T03:07:36	"Ready on Day One." Was that a shot at Rubio? Cruz? Obama?
StuPolitics	695443489929048065	2016-02-05T03:07:03	Good training for a State Department job. 
StuPolitics	695443264367820801	2016-02-05T03:06:09	I think Clinton just said that Sanders doesn't know what he is talking about.

StuPolitics	695440159588757504	2016-02-05T02:53:49	Hillary Clinton accused  Bernie Sanders of a 'very artful smear' campaign:

StuPolitics	695441277307875331	2016-02-05T02:58:15	Theoretical or hypothetical?

StuPolitics	695438125405904899	2016-02-05T02:45:44	I wish I had sold my bank stocks before this debate. And HRC and Bernie haven't even gotten to the drug companies yet.
StuPolitics	695437690070654977	2016-02-05T02:44:00	Laws! Oh c'mon. I don't care about no damn laws!
StuPolitics	695437389724909569	2016-02-05T02:42:48	Hillary wants to break up everything. Except the Yankess, I hope.
StuPolitics	695437048845447170	2016-02-05T02:41:27	Wall Street is so powerful that Barack Obama is president.

StuPolitics	695436188585316352	2016-02-05T02:38:02	"A transformational campaign." Um, well, that's a pretty high bar.

StuPolitics	695435066789359616	2016-02-05T02:33:35	No, we got the “13 Hours” trailers 
StuPolitics	695434969594789890	2016-02-05T02:33:11	Michael Moore ad -- we didn't see that during the Republican debates.
StuPolitics	695434647451279361	2016-02-05T02:31:55	The advantage of a two-person debate: the candidates can mix it up and go back and forth.
StuPolitics	695434132084563975	2016-02-05T02:29:52	Hillary just gave Bernie a chance to change the debate's tempo. Big mistake.
StuPolitics	695433736758775808	2016-02-05T02:28:18	Hillary has done well so far, but being nasty is not a good strategy.

StuPolitics	695433047546593281	2016-02-05T02:25:33	True Fact: Sanders has been endorsed by House Democrats on the Far Left.
StuPolitics	695432659267244034	2016-02-05T02:24:01	Therefore all Vermonters running for president lose? 
StuPolitics	695432359949107203	2016-02-05T02:22:49	Bernie wants a 50-state strategy. Good luck with that in Wyoming, South Carolina and Utah.
StuPolitics	695431878023651329	2016-02-05T02:20:54	But very common. One candidate invariably wants to emphasize differences, while the other tries to minimize them. 
StuPolitics	695430519316611073	2016-02-05T02:15:30	Anyone have data demonstrating that current turnout levels are a function of "people giving up on the political process?"

StuPolitics	695429909976449025	2016-02-05T02:13:05	I hope someone is keeping count of the number of times Hillary uses the word "progressive."
StuPolitics	695429225407320065	2016-02-05T02:10:22	Democrats hate Wall Street as much as Republicans hate the media.
StuPolitics	695428991646183424	2016-02-05T02:09:26	Bernie with a non-sequitur laughline in responding to Chuck Todd's question.
StuPolitics	695428139023888385	2016-02-05T02:06:03	Game. Set. And Match. To Clinton on the opening statements. As usual, Bernie is angry, while Clinton is confident.
StuPolitics	695427001809633281	2016-02-05T02:01:32	Again with the NFL style intros for a presidential debate. So unnecessary.
StuPolitics	695052061969358848	2016-02-04T01:11:39	Well, Rubio tried to be both the conservative &amp; the establishment  candidate. What's wrong with that, if it works? 
StuPolitics	695051091201900544	2016-02-04T01:07:48	Social issue candidate Santorum endorses Rubio, not Cruz. Interesting. Very interesting.

StuPolitics	694386752606314496	2016-02-02T05:07:57	I think it was a speech from a guy who wants to lead a revolution, not a political party.

StuPolitics	694385591526490112	2016-02-02T05:03:20	Sigh. "A political revolution."
StuPolitics	694385277280915456	2016-02-02T05:02:05	StuPolitics Most surprising, and least stump-ish. He knows when a deal has gone bad and it's time to walk away from the table.
StuPolitics	694385131407155200	2016-02-02T05:01:31	Do you get the sense that Sanders is just getting warmed up?
StuPolitics	694384922031734784	2016-02-02T05:00:41	Trump had the best speech tonight. It was the shortest.
StuPolitics	694384732684025856	2016-02-02T04:59:55	I'm kinda worried that Bernie could go on and on for about 3 hours....

StuPolitics	694383953038438400	2016-02-02T04:56:50	Bernie is really cranked up.
StuPolitics	694383765129420800	2016-02-02T04:56:05	Bernie uses the R word (radical).

StuPolitics	694382762921431040	2016-02-02T04:52:06	Somehow, both Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders both hate the "media establishment." I feel so unloved.

StuPolitics	694382226331537409	2016-02-02T04:49:58	A virtual tie. That's kind of like virtual reality.
StuPolitics	694381871795412993	2016-02-02T04:48:33	Lots of Democratic voters apparently don't care if they win the presidential election in 2016.

StuPolitics	694364217546248192	2016-02-02T03:38:24	Rubio giving a victory speech after a 3rd place finish. But it is justified.  He should get a bump into NH.

StuPolitics	694359632404422656	2016-02-02T03:20:11	Sad. You are right, sir!

StuPolitics	694357768455753729	2016-02-02T03:12:47	The good news for Dems is that HRC may squeak out a win. The bad news is that Sanders is close enough to encourage him and his supporters.

StuPolitics	694353988494475264	2016-02-02T02:57:45	As I always point out, the poll  numbers in Iowa are always more important than the national polls. Tonight's results are bad for Trump.

StuPolitics	694352839871717376	2016-02-02T02:53:12	What about the over-emphasis in the media on the latest poll?

StuPolitics	694347035743555585	2016-02-02T02:30:08	Anderson Cooper: So this would be a strong showing for Bernie Sanders at 48%?
StuPolitics	694346601503027200	2016-02-02T02:28:24	And Sanders couldn't be a legit candidate without George McGovern and Eugene V. Debs?

StuPolitics	694343622817357825	2016-02-02T02:16:34	Insightful.  
StuPolitics	694343074009321472	2016-02-02T02:14:23	Rubio and Sanders won the late deciders according to entrance polls
StuPolitics	694342824884436992	2016-02-02T02:13:24	Obama won Polk, the state's largest county, 39-28 against Hillary. A Hillary win would be welcome for her iacaucus

StuPolitics	694339340751769600	2016-02-02T01:59:33	Sure looks like Rubio is going to do well enough tonight to establish himself as the anti-Trump, anti-Cruz alternative.
StuPolitics	694339016724971520	2016-02-02T01:58:16	I agree. A big deal.

StuPolitics	694323097458057217	2016-02-02T00:55:00	O'Malley. Because the idea of him winning is ridiculous.

StuPolitics	693600121846632448	2016-01-31T01:02:10	Joe, Joe, Joe. It reflects how the race may develop. It points to potential strength in a possibly long race.  
StuPolitics	693598820794527744	2016-01-31T00:56:59	The point has ramifications beyond Iowa. 
StuPolitics	693598411417894913	2016-01-31T00:55:22	Fair point. But Santorum got late-breaking social conservatives who didn't know what to do. Still, DMR is quality.

StuPolitics	693593325740359680	2016-01-31T00:35:09	Absolutely. But I think Maggie was suggesting that those with cash would stay in even if they fared poorly. 
StuPolitics	693593000585383936	2016-01-31T00:33:52	maggieNYT Rubio &amp; Cruz certainly want Chtistie, Kasich, Bush, Huckabee, Carson &amp; Santorum to get out. But the actual results matter.
StuPolitics	693591927485243394	2016-01-31T00:29:36	Hard to argue with that. They may have other reasons for staying in. But will they be relevant?  
StuPolitics	693590920718110721	2016-01-31T00:25:36	Certainly possible. 
StuPolitics	693590594933899264	2016-01-31T00:24:18	maggieNYT Sure, I agree. But it all depends on how well/how poorly they do. If they have money but decide they have no path....

StuPolitics	693589222532485120	2016-01-31T00:18:51	It all depends on how they show, doesn't it?

StuPolitics	692906283658252290	2016-01-29T03:05:06	Fair question. Now we have a Cruz clip as well.... 
StuPolitics	692905892367462401	2016-01-29T03:03:32	Rubio should have let the debate move on instead of taking on Jeb. Sometimes, silence is a better option.
