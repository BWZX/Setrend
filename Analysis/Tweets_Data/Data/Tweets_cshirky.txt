cshirky	726200991792566272	2016-04-30T00:06:23	Yep. 
cshirky	726193828021956608	2016-04-29T23:37:55	If I have one advice to give, it's "Don't make a social networking startup. The ship has sailed and it sank. And then sharks ate it all."
cshirky	726181576564826112	2016-04-29T22:49:14	kraykray I always assume all StackOverflow questions are from people selling _ebooks.
cshirky	726041593980006400	2016-04-29T13:32:59	Count me naive but I'm shocked by how readily GOP &amp; media accepting Trump &amp; his xenophobia, racism, misogyny, isolationism, thuggishness,etc
cshirky	726045346556698625	2016-04-29T13:47:54	This, from ESQPolitics, is excellent and vital and important. 
cshirky	725910696722976768	2016-04-29T04:52:51	RBStalin Agreed, but I have a lite version of that theory: he needs to not piss off the women and Hispanics who haven't decided yet. (Most)
cshirky	725909794574372866	2016-04-29T04:49:16	Let me remind people explaining why Trump can't win that in Dukakis v. Bush, May polls had Dukakis up by 16%. Half a year til the election.
cshirky	725895893627506688	2016-04-29T03:54:02	adammc123 But 'lots of people hating him' isn't how the election gets decided. Its 'enough people liking him in half a dozen swing states.'
cshirky	725895640295690240	2016-04-29T03:53:01	SamSeder If Trump is a wild card and she doesn't match up as well, what conclusion do you draw? Inevitable Clinton win?

cshirky	725894888382820354	2016-04-29T03:50:02	matttbastard Both candidates have high unfavorability ratings, which makes that a less fatal flaw here.
cshirky	725894484857221124	2016-04-29T03:48:26	iolantherosa Twitter has recently added an Unfollow button. I think you're really going to like it.
cshirky	725894301369016320	2016-04-29T03:47:42	iolantherosa And if you'd averaged 'Clinton v. Sanders' in 2015, that showed a blowout too. Half a year is a long time.
cshirky	725893834677178368	2016-04-29T03:45:51	SamSeder But the same goes for your response. A big part of my argument is that, in a year of surprises, don't assume things are normal now
cshirky	725893308396883968	2016-04-29T03:43:45	alurabrava Strong for Clinton, for sure. Obama's a great campaigner. But independent dissatisfaction with him blunts that advantage a bit
cshirky	725892997875789826	2016-04-29T03:42:31	SamSeder No, I assume that with Sanders eliminated, his voters don't have anyone with his same issue mix, and may choose to stay home.
cshirky	725892655666749442	2016-04-29T03:41:10	ragouri But independents staying home because they don't like either choice, and swing states suffering economically are in his favor.
cshirky	725892352762470401	2016-04-29T03:39:57	ragouri The big bet is the one I noted -- that he can persuade 'leans R' women to turn out. If the gender gap is large enough, he loses.
cshirky	725891942886694912	2016-04-29T03:38:20	SamSeder Opinions &amp; behavior in primaries don't line up with same in the general. T6 months to, with undecideds choosing in mid-October.

cshirky	725891024732577792	2016-04-29T03:34:41	thalkowski ScienceLifeNY You think Clinton has a lock on this?
cshirky	725890896978305024	2016-04-29T03:34:10	RBStalin Yeah, and I can't think of any crazy political events unfolding in Florida in a Presidential election, so I guess we win! Yay us!
cshirky	725889684698619904	2016-04-29T03:29:21	Clinton's advantages are almost all about being in office, not getting there. The easiest way for Trump to win is people thinking he can't.
cshirky	725889554557726720	2016-04-29T03:28:50	Any two of those states and the race is a coin flip. If Florida is one of the two, it's Donald J. Trump, President of the United States.
cshirky	725889322231058432	2016-04-29T03:27:55	Or think of it geographically. Could Trump take Florida? Could he flip Iowa, Ohio, or Wisconsin to Red? New Hampshire? Virginia? Colorado?
cshirky	725889160565792768	2016-04-29T03:27:16	Think of this demographically:Could liberal independents be demoralized enough to stay home? And Trump persuade 'leans Right' women to vote?
cshirky	725889010783023104	2016-04-29T03:26:41	If 'leans Fuck you all' beats 'leans Left' in voters minds, a Clinton win is in question. She's at more risk from low turnout than Trump.
cshirky	725888864460492801	2016-04-29T03:26:06	But as ChrisLHayes pointed out years ago, the people yet to vote - most - don't think about issues, but values. 
cshirky	725888768989765632	2016-04-29T03:25:43	If it's party - if 'leans Left' voters turn out and vote left, like in '08 &amp; '12 - then it's President-Elect Clinton, 51%-49%, on Nov. 8th.
cshirky	725888650643275777	2016-04-29T03:25:15	So: Do undecided voters identify more strongly with party, or with their feelings of inclusion or exclusion from traditional politics?
cshirky	725888566513934340	2016-04-29T03:24:55	Neither of those advantages are enough to win, or even to come close. The race will be decided by the undecideds, both on turnout and choice
cshirky	725888484892762113	2016-04-29T03:24:35	November, as always, will be Democrat vs. Republican, but also insider vs. outsider. HRC will get all Dem insiders, Trump all GOP outsiders.
cshirky	725888398523666432	2016-04-29T03:24:15	That describes the primaries in March and April. Trump and Sanders ran outsider campaigns from inside the parties. 
cshirky	725888298753761280	2016-04-29T03:23:51	But '16 isn't just left-right. Draw a horizontal line, insiders below and outsiders above. Now go clockwise: Sanders, Trump, Cruz, Clinton.
cshirky	725888222903984128	2016-04-29T03:23:33	Get a piece of paper and draw a vertical line. This is the familiar left-right split. In a left-right contest, Clinton would prevail.
cshirky	725888139529588739	2016-04-29T03:23:13	All of those are scary, but what should scare liberals much more is that Trump could just win, with no dramatic change in circumstance.
cshirky	725888058906669057	2016-04-29T03:22:54	In the next 6 months, events could favor Trump's rhetoric. Terrorist attack. Bank collapse. Saudis jack up oil prices after 9/11 report.
cshirky	725887952413319168	2016-04-29T03:22:28	Liberals miss this, because we search his speeches for ideas. But Trump's not a statesman or a policy wonk. He's an orator and a demagogue.
cshirky	725887880455835650	2016-04-29T03:22:11	Donald Trump out-campaigned more than a dozen GOP challengers while speaking off the cuff, an achievement with no modern precedent.
cshirky	725887795894448130	2016-04-29T03:21:51	Trump is the reverse. He is a terrible leader, but a brilliant -- potentially world-changingly brilliant -- campaigner.
cshirky	725887719784615936	2016-04-29T03:21:33	As sadydoyle notes, people love Clinton when she's in office (69% approval at State) but not when she's running. 
cshirky	725887519682781184	2016-04-29T03:20:45	With that as background, look at the candidates. Trump is one of the greatest campaigners of this political era. Clinton is not.
cshirky	725887420898537474	2016-04-29T03:20:22	And Obama's win required turning some formerly Red states Blue, so Democrats are vulnerable to even slightly reduced voter turnout.
cshirky	725887309963386881	2016-04-29T03:19:55	At a minimum, Trump v. Clinton will be closer than Romney v. Obama was, and that election was settled with a difference of only 4%.
cshirky	725887224475054080	2016-04-29T03:19:35	With the general election now clearer, liberals have to deal with the threat that Trump could beat Clinton.

cshirky	721010796822528001	2016-04-15T16:22:24	Storified: Sen. Sanders' campaign holds a lesson for future political movements: National. Liberal. White. Pick two. 
cshirky	721008045866635264	2016-04-15T16:11:28	blargster Depends when you think 'the outset' was. He's known since 2015: 
cshirky	720993773375754240	2016-04-15T15:14:45	Imagining a mostly-white path to the Democratic nomination was never a good idea. Let's hope we're witnessing the last time anyone tries it.
cshirky	720993491619172352	2016-04-15T15:13:38	The glory of the Democratic party in 2016 is that it looks like America ca. 2046. They've figured out how run in the country we're becoming.
cshirky	720993354285056000	2016-04-15T15:13:05	The Democrats have now won the popular vote 5 times in the 6 elections since 1992. (Gore got more votes than Bush in 2000.)
cshirky	720993226274922500	2016-04-15T15:12:35	But it's not the 20C any more, and the Democrats have figured out how to win elections, even with 60% of whites consistently against them.
cshirky	720993038764417024	2016-04-15T15:11:50	White abandonment, especially by Southerners, cost the Democratic party 5 out of the 6 presidential elections between 1968 and 1988.
cshirky	720992925669142529	2016-04-15T15:11:23	If it was still the 20C, targeting mostly white voters might have been a winning strategy, as the loss of those voters was such a blow.
cshirky	720992735356788737	2016-04-15T15:10:38	White liberals should be *really wary* about holding any conviction that requires us to close our ears when black people are talking.
cshirky	720992596982632449	2016-04-15T15:10:05	Sanders' assertion that black voters would be persuaded "once they get to know me" was obtuse and futile, and worse, it was ethically weak.
cshirky	720992433866039296	2016-04-15T15:09:26	It's almost as if black citizens have a different experience of life in America than whites.
cshirky	720992321618051073	2016-04-15T15:08:59	Asked if they expect their family finances to improve or worsen in the next 6 months, only 20% of whites say Improve. 60% of blacks do.
cshirky	720992205838528512	2016-04-15T15:08:31	Black citizens are twice as likely to say 'the country is headed in the right direction' as whites are.  
cshirky	720992089777901568	2016-04-15T15:08:04	All that 'Deep South' theorizing runs aground on this fact: black citizens approve of the President, and want a continuation of his policies
cshirky	720991946567626753	2016-04-15T15:07:30	Here's how: Sanders voters, mostly white, are broadly disappointed with Obama. Black voters do not share that sentiment. (To put it mildly.)
cshirky	720991841923936260	2016-04-15T15:07:05	This led to much bafflement, especially among young progressives. How could black citizens *not* want the revolution Sanders is selling?
cshirky	720991294298849280	2016-04-15T15:04:54	Misplaced faith in Sanders' black surrogates kept many white supporters from understanding his electoral weakness outside white districts.
cshirky	720991161964335104	2016-04-15T15:04:23	West &amp; Render didn't convince black voters to choose Sanders, but they did convince progressive whites not to worry about black support.
cshirky	720990934746279937	2016-04-15T15:03:28	If you wanted to persuade black voters who are proud of Obama that they should vote Sanders, Dr. West is the *last* person you'd choose.
cshirky	720990816953446400	2016-04-15T15:03:00	And Cornel West? There is not another African-American intellectual more associated with disdain for President Obama than he is.
cshirky	720990716101586944	2016-04-15T15:02:36	Meanwhile, Sanders' outreach to black voters mostly failed. 'Killer' Mike Render was supposed to persuade...who exactly? Church ladies?
cshirky	720990466607427584	2016-04-15T15:01:37	Those voters are not coming back. 1980 was a long time ago. 'Reagan Democrats' are just Republicans. 
cshirky	720990320662425601	2016-04-15T15:01:02	Even now, the biggest disagreement in policy preferences between working class whites &amp; Dems remains 'Aid to Blacks' 
cshirky	720990181684174849	2016-04-15T15:00:29	The idea of white workers returning to the fold if Democrats talk to them about economics is a persistent fantasy. 
cshirky	720990057004273665	2016-04-15T14:59:59	And in every election since 1964, a majority of whites opted for the party telling them white people are special, but minimum wage is a trap
cshirky	720989707383889921	2016-04-15T14:58:36	For half a century, white voters have had a choice between a party offering economic help but no racial flattery, or flattery but no help.
cshirky	720989615226621952	2016-04-15T14:58:14	The most vitriolic departed in '64, then '68 for Wallace's segregationist vision. Finally, the 'Reagan Democrats' abandoned Carter in '80.
cshirky	720989498104938496	2016-04-15T14:57:46	But the Democrats didn't abandon whites in the working class. Whites abandoned the Democrats. The Civil Rights Act triggered their exodus.
cshirky	720989416286584832	2016-04-15T14:57:26	This is the Thomas Frank version of history, where Democrats abandoned their natural constituencies, including white blue-collar workers.
cshirky	720989306790158338	2016-04-15T14:57:00	Sanders' mistake was a common one: Believing he could get the white working class to vote Democrat again. 
cshirky	720989103735463936	2016-04-15T14:56:12	Southern Democrats--of whom black voters have the highest turnout--are essential. They gave us Obama, twice, via Virginia and Florida wins.
cshirky	720988884813754368	2016-04-15T14:55:20	The only way he'd be leading is if black Democrats in populous Blue states mattered less than white Democrats in sparse Red ones.
cshirky	720988759525724160	2016-04-15T14:54:50	Sanders gets this. Given a chance to complain about conservative or Red states, he's instead repeated his dismissal of Southern Democrats.
cshirky	720988635168813057	2016-04-15T14:54:20	Even if only Blue states counted, Sanders would still be behind. The only region whose disappearance would leave him ahead is...the South.
cshirky	720988517652783104	2016-04-15T14:53:52	But that 'fact' isn't one. Idaho &amp; Wyoming are far more conservative than Georgia &amp; Texas. Virginia &amp; Florida have been Blue since '08.
cshirky	720988437113798657	2016-04-15T14:53:33	Sanders says his dismissal of the South rests on the fact that those voters are the most conservative. 
cshirky	720988192967499776	2016-04-15T14:52:35	Sanders talked about doing better w/black voters outside the "Deep South", but that meant 2-1 against, at best. It cost him MO, IL, and OH.
cshirky	720988110822055936	2016-04-15T14:52:15	The broad rejection of Sanders by a core (_the_ core) Democratic constituency has caused the campaign some distress, and a hunt for answers.
cshirky	720988028517232640	2016-04-15T14:51:55	The Sanders' camp had always known they'd have a problem with black voters, but 6-1 against? That wasn't a loss. It was a rebuke.
cshirky	720987959135109121	2016-04-15T14:51:39	Then South Carolina. For all the twists &amp; turns since, SC was the end of the tie. Sanders down by 26. Never ahead again. Never close.
cshirky	720987880072425472	2016-04-15T14:51:20	(Shoutout to RBStalin, the only person I know adequately outraged by lily-white First In The Nation elections.) Then Nevada, nearly a tie.
cshirky	720987774204030976	2016-04-15T14:50:55	Sanders did well in IA (5th whitest state), leaving him only 2 delegates behind. Then he won NH (4th whitest) and was up by 4.
cshirky	720987631949979648	2016-04-15T14:50:21	...and that after Obama, a Democrat could still win with mostly white voters. This mistake was made easier by the electoral calendar.
cshirky	720987554401505280	2016-04-15T14:50:02	This has taken a while to sink in. Per docrocktex26, many people assumed the Obama coalition was temporary... 
cshirky	720987416505372673	2016-04-15T14:49:30	Senator Sanders' campaign holds a lesson for future political movements: National. Liberal. White. Pick two.

cshirky	718826707214438401	2016-04-09T15:43:36	But something's changed in 2016. Fortune can write about "Donald Trump’s Social Media Ties To White Supremacists." 
cshirky	718826582790373376	2016-04-09T15:43:07	Even recently, the press has covered Confederate flag debates without describing the source of its appeal as a symbol of racist treason.
cshirky	718826501039218688	2016-04-09T15:42:47	Racist and racism became like genocide or torture, words whose plain English meaning made them unutterable, because they were too clear.

cshirky	718826313205723136	2016-04-09T15:42:02	Though it wasn't hard to spot, calling a sitting President a racist Just Wasn't Done. The press had to chose: Truth-telling or neutrality.
cshirky	718826239679533056	2016-04-09T15:41:45	When he gutted the Equal Employment office, installing Clarence Thomas, centrist news outlets rarely made Reagan's racial bias explicit.
cshirky	718826187175239680	2016-04-09T15:41:32	When Reagan repeated discredited stories about welfare queens in Chicago, the national press reported it as a slip, not part of a pattern.
cshirky	718826118162153472	2016-04-09T15:41:16	Some papers noted the racial appeal, some not. The Washington Post denied it had to do with race. None made it part of regular reporting.
cshirky	718826050579369984	2016-04-09T15:41:00	In '80, Reagan began his campaign with a call for "States' rights", near where civil rights workers had been murdered just 16 years prior.
cshirky	718825975451033603	2016-04-09T15:40:42	Yet the press treated GOP racism as a set of rare, surprising, disconnected events, rather than as a deep, long-lived strategic choice.
cshirky	718825853392543744	2016-04-09T15:40:13	Nixon's Southern Strategy was a completely explicit welcome to 'Wallace Voters' (racist Southern whites), giving them a home in the GOP.
cshirky	718825775273644037	2016-04-09T15:39:54	The press isn't some detached institution. They participate in political life, and have shied away from calling out racism for decades.
cshirky	718825694998822912	2016-04-09T15:39:35	You could reply "Duh. He and many of his policies &amp; supporters ARE racist." But the odd bit isn't that its true, its that press now says so.
cshirky	718825644495216640	2016-04-09T15:39:23	Here's an odd thing, in the Age of Trump: the mainstream press is willing to write about him, his policies, and his supporters, as racist.

cshirky	710112418727202816	2016-03-16T14:36:08	And here's the corker: take a look at Ohio, divided into counties that went for Obama vs. Clinton in 2008. 
cshirky	710112234647592960	2016-03-16T14:35:24	It gets worse. Here's the map of wards in Cook County. Not one plurality-black ward voted for Sanders. Not one. 
cshirky	710112077466107904	2016-03-16T14:34:47	And then Illinois, jesus. Illinois is a Sanders' love-fest, except Cook County. That ONE COUNTY turned a win into a loss.
cshirky	710111958343659521	2016-03-16T14:34:18	Missouri is Sanders' country--except St. Louis &amp; Kansas City. North Carolina, Sanders gets Appalachia. Florida: bloodbath. 124 to 60.
cshirky	710111814508384256	2016-03-16T14:33:44	Look at the charts. 
cshirky	710111642235764737	2016-03-16T14:33:03	If black citizens don't turn out for you, you don't get to be the nominee. Denying Clinton's lead requires ignoring that demographic reality
cshirky	710111523553746944	2016-03-16T14:32:35	That attitude is a disaster for the Democrats. We know how to win national races, and it centers on the black vote. Not includes-centers on.
cshirky	710111398303379457	2016-03-16T14:32:05	There's tortured language around this, like 'Southern Firewall', but that's just camouflage for "We care less about Alabama than Maine."
cshirky	710111216388018176	2016-03-16T14:31:21	Facing this, Sanders' supporters want to suggest the tide is turning, but this means discounting that more citizens have voted for Clinton.
cshirky	710111126445359105	2016-03-16T14:31:00	More voters want Clinton than Sanders. He's led delegate count only once, 36/32, after NH. He fell behind after NV, and has never recovered.
cshirky	710110998284210176	2016-03-16T14:30:29	Voters who might swing a state rarely vote in primaries. In the primaries, a citizen in SC matters just as much as one from NH, by design.
cshirky	710110930483281921	2016-03-16T14:30:13	This is wrong. The primaries are when Democrats *nationwide* choose their candidate. There are 50 Blue states. None Red. None Swing.
cshirky	710110852355993601	2016-03-16T14:29:55	Part of this is based on bad civics, where people think primaries are a dry run for the general, and talk about Red, Blue and Swing states.
cshirky	710110771481411584	2016-03-16T14:29:35	"Beltway media is so shocked and dismayed by the success of the Obama coalition they're pretending it died." Sanders' people pretending too.
cshirky	710110662987362304	2016-03-16T14:29:09	This is laid out in docrocktex26's When Racism Trumps Socialism, one of the best political analyses of the year: 
cshirky	710110398360358913	2016-03-16T14:28:06	Sanders' voters denial of actual outcomes was always puzzling. Now its alarming. It says 'Black votes don't matter'  
cshirky	710091704427159553	2016-03-16T13:13:49	Pedinska That's what the Sander's people believed until today. Did you see the Illinois chart?

cshirky	710035914978758656	2016-03-16T09:32:08	zaskoda Not that impactful. Clinton won popular vote in '08, but Obama won the election, because his campaign focussed on delegates.
cshirky	710035568445423616	2016-03-16T09:30:45	Whites have never faced lawmakers specifically out to cause us harm. Under those pressures, trust can beat promises. 
cshirky	710031742594211840	2016-03-16T09:15:33	Sanders people: "The hard states and Southern firewall are behind us."  Translation: Finally free of black voters.
cshirky	709966528163221505	2016-03-16T04:56:25	Yes. Superdelegates are irrelevant; they've never overturned an election. Sanders is 300 behind on the popular vote 
cshirky	709960707832467456	2016-03-16T04:33:17	"The landslides tonight all went in Clinton's favor."  "State" is not the unit of competition here. "Delegate" is.
cshirky	709956355864576001	2016-03-16T04:16:00	Clinton won the popular vote in '08. Harder case for Sanders, who is losing that vote. Now over 300 delegates behind 
cshirky	709950605154856960	2016-03-16T03:53:09	People who are amazed or stunned by Trump should follow accounts like  GodBlessRELee. Trump makes sense after that. 
cshirky	709947620110630912	2016-03-16T03:41:17	chrisFnicholson It's true. If black voters don't like you, you don't get to be nominee. Look at Sanders in Illinois 
cshirky	709944600044150784	2016-03-16T03:29:17	With any luck, maybe elected officials in America will start thinking black lives can at least cost them their jobs.
cshirky	709909525298479104	2016-03-16T01:09:54	chrisFnicholson We get it. Sanders people are tired of black voters. But you do know that Florida and Ohio voted for Obama in 2012, right?
cshirky	709892927531552769	2016-03-16T00:03:57	alexanderlarge Redistrict Nope. Voters who can flip a state *don't vote in  primaries.* Primary and Gen'l are totally different processes.
cshirky	709889709116252160	2016-03-15T23:51:10	Primaries don't have R/B, &amp; aren't a trial run for fall. They're for national political parties to pick a candidate.

cshirky	706982867553746944	2016-03-07T23:20:25	In the 21st century, moderate blacks are a make-or-break part of that coalition. If they don't vote for you, you don't get to be the nominee
cshirky	706982252090003456	2016-03-07T23:17:58	Dems don't get to decide if they're pursuing coalition politics or not. Nationally, the Democratic Party IS a coalition, or it's nothing.
cshirky	706982080006062080	2016-03-07T23:17:17	Whites abandoned the Dems in '64. ~60% of whites vote GOP; ~90% of blacks vote Dem. There are fewer progressive whites than moderate blacks.
cshirky	706981952817999872	2016-03-07T23:16:47	slippyshoe Keep reading and you'll see if I'm serious or not.
cshirky	706981792352378881	2016-03-07T23:16:09	Black voters have never mattered to his career. He's on the right side of civil rights, like all viable Dems, but far from the front lines.
cshirky	706981671631847424	2016-03-07T23:15:40	Sanders' arrest 53 years ago didn't do much, since he moved to one of the whitest states in the nation (Vermont: 1.2% black) 48 years ago.
cshirky	706981015143653377	2016-03-07T23:13:03	In those conditions, a sense of "Does he get it, and will he listen right now?" can beat long-ago actions, however noble.
cshirky	706980557784100864	2016-03-07T23:11:14	More than whites, black voters have to assess whether someone is _with them_, how they'll govern in the face of overt and structural racism.
cshirky	706980430843490304	2016-03-07T23:10:44	But placing blame matters. Black voters can't just pick candidates on issues, because campaign promises to blacks often fail.
cshirky	706980331346198528	2016-03-07T23:10:20	When I noted this, someone replied it was no different than a promise *he'd* change "although tone of where blame is placed is different."
cshirky	706980216615231488	2016-03-07T23:09:53	It's there again, under that message, a low rumble that says "My positions are best for you, and you'll change when you figure that out."
cshirky	706980105357172736	2016-03-07T23:09:26	Even Sanders recent insistence that black voters would swing to him "once they get to know me better" was not...helpful.
cshirky	706979942563598336	2016-03-07T23:08:48	Kettle-drum messages hurt Sanders. There's no black constituency *for* income inequality, or $$$ college, but he didn't generate trust.
cshirky	706979775319937024	2016-03-07T23:08:08	And on voting day, issues don't vote. Voters vote. If it comes to it, they'll vote for people they trust over people they merely agree with.
cshirky	706979625625210880	2016-03-07T23:07:32	A voter can agree with a politician on every issue and still not trust them, or trust a pol without agreeing with all their positions.
cshirky	706979531068805120	2016-03-07T23:07:09	Pols have to consider policies *and* coalitions. On racism, policies can be less persuasive than a sense of whether a candidate "gets it."
cshirky	706979430342602756	2016-03-07T23:06:45	You could tell yourself this is false consciousness, but that's a label, not a cure. Racism is real, pervasive, and not reducible to class.
cshirky	706979271428804608	2016-03-07T23:06:08	Sometimes poor whites will vote down aid for poor people, since it threatens the one bit of social status they have: Better off than blacks
cshirky	706979175165374464	2016-03-07T23:05:45	This is "class matters more than race", and its obvious that that is sometimes true. But not always, and less often than many whites think.
cshirky	706979068806180864	2016-03-07T23:05:19	Or: "The purpose of scapegoating, setting whites vs blacks, native born vs immigrants, is to deflect from issues that could unite them."
cshirky	706978894054760449	2016-03-07T23:04:38	Or accusing Clinton--Obama's first Sec. of State, during wartime--of faking closeness to the President, to curry favor with blacks? Hear it?
cshirky	706978374711844864	2016-03-07T23:02:34	Many blacks have some disagreement with PBO--even *Sasha* probably doesn't agree with everything he did. But to lead with that?
cshirky	706978250099073026	2016-03-07T23:02:04	Sanders was saying: "One of the few key things a black audience should hear from me are ways I think the first black President is wrong."
cshirky	706978156448624640	2016-03-07T23:01:42	A white pol on BET isn't just listing policies. They're saying "Let me tell you the 4 or 5 key things a black audience should hear from me."
cshirky	706977803766337536	2016-03-07T23:00:18	In '88, BET News assembled a nationwide black audience for politics. That was new, and matters in a way that CBS's white anchors didn't.
cshirky	706977727069356032	2016-03-07T22:59:59	Prior to channels like BET, at any given hour any given black citizen could tell you if someone who looks like them was on TV. (Mostly not.)
cshirky	706977634974969856	2016-03-07T22:59:37	You can think of it this way:  "I wonder if there is a Caucasian on TV right now", said no white person ever.
cshirky	706977453214838785	2016-03-07T22:58:54	But Sanders disagreeing with PBO on BET is a different thing. It's hard to explain BET if you didn't live through the pre-cable media world.
cshirky	706977374101905408	2016-03-07T22:58:35	What did I think was wrong with that? Sanders is left of the President on economic issues. Surely he's entitled to those disagreements?
cshirky	706977301104173056	2016-03-07T22:58:18	After Sanders went on BET to say President Obama "is wrong on certain issues", I facepalmed on Twitter, and saw liberal incomprehension.
cshirky	706977171777007616	2016-03-07T22:57:47	Sanders changed his message on BLM, but then sent the same kind of messages elsewhere.
cshirky	706977044714758144	2016-03-07T22:57:17	'Black lives of course matter' suggests the issue is obvious, when in fact political will to reduce police killings isn't obvious at all.

cshirky	701021419669311488	2016-02-20T12:31:45	But the cherry on top here is Sanders' suggestion that she is trying to trick black voters into liking her.

cshirky	701021169210695680	2016-02-20T12:30:45	So a white guy telling black voters PBO should be something of a disappointment  (and, by implication, that he'd do better) is insulting.

cshirky	701020614128107520	2016-02-20T12:28:33	PBO's actions *were* limited, because, from literally the day he took office, GOP strategy was “If he was for it, we had to be against it.”
cshirky	701020504719667201	2016-02-20T12:28:07	A white candidate explaining to black voters that the first black President didn't do all he could for them so misses the point it hurts.

cshirky	700189869008506881	2016-02-18T05:27:28	The old defense against this by the parties was "You and what army?" No third party has been anything other than a spoiler in a century.

cshirky	700186967737106434	2016-02-18T05:15:56	The new scale Facebook introduces into politics is this: all registered American voters, ~150M people, are now a *medium-sized* group.
cshirky	700186619932839936	2016-02-18T05:14:33	"The personal and social consequences of any medium result from the new scale introduced into our affairs by any new technology."
cshirky	700186508406337536	2016-02-18T05:14:07	McLuhan famously said "The medium is the message." This is often regarded as inscrutably gnomic, but he explained it perfectly clearly.
cshirky	700186372246622209	2016-02-18T05:13:34	And then there was vote-getting. Facebook and MyBarackObama let the Obama campaign run their own vote-getting machine out of Chicago.
cshirky	700186149361299456	2016-02-18T05:12:41	Online fundraising let outsiders raise funds, and it became a symbol of purity. Anyone *not* raising money at $25 a pop is now a plutocrat.
cshirky	700186035888599040	2016-02-18T05:12:14	Social media is at the heart of all of this. Meetup and Myspace meant Dean and Obama didn't have to be billionaires to get a message out.
cshirky	700185906674692096	2016-02-18T05:11:43	This was the last piece. Perot adopted non-centrist media, Dean distributed fundraising, Obama non-party voter mobilization.
cshirky	700185795882123264	2016-02-18T05:11:17	The second advantage was that Obama's voter mobilization strategy--the crown jewels--was superior to that of the Democratic Party itself.
cshirky	700185646795624448	2016-02-18T05:10:41	Obama could campaign not just on being prescient (as Dean also was) but on having been proved right years earlier.
cshirky	700185470085410816	2016-02-18T05:09:59	Besides charisma, he had two advantages Dean didn't have. First, the anti-war position had gone from principled oppositon to common sense.
cshirky	700185346747682820	2016-02-18T05:09:30	That took Obama. Obama was less of an outsider than Dean (though still regarded as unelectable in '07) but used most of Dean's playbook.
cshirky	700185249590824962	2016-02-18T05:09:06	After webifying Perot's media tactics, Dean pioneered online fundraising. Unfortunately for him, his Get Out The Vote operation didn't.
cshirky	700185128018968576	2016-02-18T05:08:37	Mentioning X became Dean's hallmark. Far from marginalizing him, it got him tons of free news coverage. Trump is just biting those rhymes.
cshirky	700184997957750785	2016-02-18T05:08:06	For All Serious People, this was crazy talk. (Dean was, of course, completely correct.) This was also tonic to a passionate set of voters.
cshirky	700184889748918278	2016-02-18T05:07:41	Dean said "There is a very real danger that war in Iraq will fuel the fires of international terror."
cshirky	700184751345250305	2016-02-18T05:07:08	Dean said "Iraq is a divided country, with Sunni, Shia and Kurdish factions that share both bitter rivalries and large quantities of arms."
cshirky	700184625608466432	2016-02-18T05:06:38	Dean didn't care. In February of 2003, he said "If the war lasts more than a few weeks, the danger of humanitarian disaster is high."
cshirky	700184507094212610	2016-02-18T05:06:09	In '03, All Serious People (aka DC insiders) agreed the U.S. *had* to invade Iraq. Opposition to the war was not to be a campaign issue.

cshirky	700183735690395648	2016-02-18T05:03:06	Post-Perot, cable became outside candidates' tool for jailbreaking Don't Mention X: Buchanan on culture war, Nader on consumer protection.
cshirky	700183650713796608	2016-02-18T05:02:45	Perot's ads attacked GOP management of the economy head on. He was the first candidate to purchase national attention at market rates.
cshirky	700183536087670785	2016-02-18T05:02:18	That year, the GOP's 'Don't Mention X' issue was the weakness of Reaganomics. Party orthodoxy said reducing tax rates would raise revenues.
cshirky	700183394529882112	2016-02-18T05:01:44	Cable changed things, allowing outsiders to campaign more easily. In '92, Ross Perot, 3rd party candidate, campaigned through infomercials.
cshirky	700183272085549056	2016-02-18T05:01:15	This was BC: Before Cable. One or two newspapers per town, three TV stations; all centrist, white, pro-business, respectful of authority.
cshirky	700183099523530753	2016-02-18T05:00:34	These limits were enforced by party discipline, and mass media whose economics meant political centrism was the best way to make money.
cshirky	700182684849479680	2016-02-18T04:58:55	In order to preserve inherently unstable coalitions, party elites &amp; press had to put some issues into the 'Don't Mention X' category.
cshirky	700182556226879489	2016-02-18T04:58:24	This is especially important in the U.S., because our two-party system creates ideologically unstable parties *by design.*
cshirky	700182441315577858	2016-02-18T04:57:57	Politically acceptable discourse is limited by supply, not demand. The public is hungry for more than politicians are willing to discuss.
cshirky	700182117599150080	2016-02-18T04:56:40	The Overton Window was imagined as a limit on public opinion, but in politics, it's the limit on what politicians will express in public.
cshirky	700182035407572994	2016-02-18T04:56:20	Social media is breaking the political 'Overton Window' -- the ability of elites to determine the outside edges of acceptable conversation.
cshirky	700181993695289344	2016-02-18T04:56:10	I started writing about both parties becoming host bodies for 3rd party candidates. Instead of an essay, it turned into 50 tweets. Here goes

cshirky	698442352931672064	2016-02-13T09:43:28	CodyBrown I think Clinton has to say more about reining in financialization of the US economy, and emphasize that many current problems...
cshirky	698441977050767360	2016-02-13T09:41:58	CodyBrown ...the issue of taking on the financial sector was downplayed by most political elites, so it gives Sanders real credibility.
cshirky	698441492189224961	2016-02-13T09:40:02	codybrown There's no perfect solution. Sanders' appeal answers the old Q 'Whatever happened to OccupyWallStreet?' Like Trump's wall...
cshirky	698438507845398528	2016-02-13T09:28:11	...and that arguing about electability is one step from concern trolling, useless at best and potentially harmful.
cshirky	698438402618707968	2016-02-13T09:27:46	But anyone who wants to convince Sanders' supporters to reconsider has to accept that there are valid reasons to support him...
cshirky	698438320783634432	2016-02-13T09:27:26	I think Clinton is the better candidate, because she has more relevant experience to being President and Commander in Chief.
cshirky	698438245802086401	2016-02-13T09:27:08	The lived experience of young voters is that people talking about 'electability' are blowing smoke.
cshirky	698438166911459329	2016-02-13T09:26:50	No one under 25 has voted in an election where the progressive candidate lost. The GOP has only won the popular vote once this century.
cshirky	698438046178369538	2016-02-13T09:26:21	When old people tell young people a vote for Sanders is 'merely symbolic', they ignore a key demographic reality of the American electorate:
cshirky	698437918843514880	2016-02-13T09:25:50	Does "appealing but unelectable" sound familiar? That's what people said about Obama in '08 (eg "The Next McGovern" )
cshirky	698437765118099456	2016-02-13T09:25:14	It's not just ineffective but counter-productive. Take "I Get Sanders’ Appeal. But He’s Not a Credible President"  
cshirky	698437580723920896	2016-02-13T09:24:30	I'm a Clinton supporter and hope to be able to vote for her in November, but hectoring young Sanders supporters is a terrible idea.
