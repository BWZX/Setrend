PIrelandatBC	724777974407544832	2016-04-26T01:51:49	PIrelandatBC during a recession, do you feel like there's more risk or do you feel more risk averse?
PIrelandatBC	724777794316701696	2016-04-26T01:51:06	v nice paper  mystery remains why it's the price and not quantity of risk that winds up mattering in these models
PIrelandatBC	724639011793473539	2016-04-25T16:39:38	kocherlakota009 DavidBeckworth yes, that's why i say it's "ironic:" an inflation nutter might easily argue for more accommodative policy
PIrelandatBC	724629632276926464	2016-04-25T16:02:21	kocherlakota009 DavidBeckworth yes i think we agree: the problem with a simple R-rule is that it can fail to make this distinction

PIrelandatBC	724615610613772288	2016-04-25T15:06:38	kocherlakota009 DavidBeckworth but yes i agree: irony is the fed should now focus on the question of whether inf is returning to target.
PIrelandatBC	724615043799736320	2016-04-25T15:04:23	kocherlakota009 DavidBeckworth measurement still an issue, b/c some would take 5% unemp as a sign that policy needs to tighten ...

PIrelandatBC	724255686587195392	2016-04-24T15:16:26	totally uninterested in any kind of "far right" academic agenda. focus should be on plato, aristotle, hume, locke, and smith

PIrelandatBC	723261592289304576	2016-04-21T21:26:15	t0nyyates in that way, appeal to the monetary pillar might have disarmed the ecb hawks
PIrelandatBC	723261401586892800	2016-04-21T21:25:30	t0nyyates my point is: if that was your concern, wouldn't your mind be put at ease by a "cross check" that shows M3 not growing at all?
PIrelandatBC	723261278999961600	2016-04-21T21:25:01	t0nyyates yes but suppose from some reason you were worried that ECB policy was actually too easy &amp; there was a threat of higher inflation
PIrelandatBC	723199087995047937	2016-04-21T17:17:53	FabioGhironi t0nyyates so there's irony in that they ignored the M pillar at exactly the point when it might have done some good
PIrelandatBC	723198739993653249	2016-04-21T17:16:30	FabioGhironi t0nyyates might have been swayed to some extent by logic that connects the lack of money growth to the lack of inflation.
PIrelandatBC	723198572959682560	2016-04-21T17:15:50	FabioGhironi t0nyyates it's hard to know whether ANYONE would have listened to reason.  but one might have hoped that the Germans ...
PIrelandatBC	723191147506458624	2016-04-21T16:46:20	t0nyyates FabioGhironi ... at least some that despite low interest rates, ecb policy was highly restrictive
PIrelandatBC	723191022579265536	2016-04-21T16:45:50	t0nyyates FabioGhironi still, this picture showing a prolonged period of slow M3 growth might have convinced ... 
PIrelandatBC	723188116480135168	2016-04-21T16:34:17	FabioGhironi ironically, had the ecb not de-facto abandoned its second monetary pillar, this point would be abundantly clear!
PIrelandatBC	723179544165777410	2016-04-21T16:00:14	BrianCAlbrecht iarroyo48 seeing as how peter ireland, macroeconomic foundations part 0, isn't even done yet, i can't be too critical!
PIrelandatBC	723154675051057152	2016-04-21T14:21:24	BrianCAlbrecht agreed. 1st bullet point at  puts it nicely. rigorous not dogmatic. takes genius to find that balance

PIrelandatBC	721105888455614468	2016-04-15T22:40:15	clusterpuk they actually teach you to do that in grad school. so you're already operating at a very advanced level.

PIrelandatBC	720276159682875393	2016-04-13T15:43:13	just hard to believe letting banks write their own "living wills" will solve too big to fail
PIrelandatBC	719653318121795586	2016-04-11T22:28:16	Noahpinion yes! would also re-stoke fears that the planet has come to destroy us all.

PIrelandatBC	717354544934621184	2016-04-05T14:13:45	1954swilliamson interesting!  will look for references myself but if you know of any on the factors determining excess reserve demand ...
PIrelandatBC	717172420906467329	2016-04-05T02:10:04	1954swilliamson yes. or if, instead, excess reserves provide liquidity services to banks that t-bills don't, the spread can exist

PIrelandatBC	717088259474595840	2016-04-04T20:35:38	YamesAlexander yes maybe too generous!  trouble w/the monetary base is that, by paying int on reserves, the fed has shifted the demand ...
PIrelandatBC	717088037524602880	2016-04-04T20:34:45	1954swilliamson .. otherwise there is indeterminacy/liq trap.  so my advice would have to include maintaining the positive spread
PIrelandatBC	717087841646411776	2016-04-04T20:33:58	1954swilliamson yes that's the key: there has to be a small but positive spread between reserves and t-bill rate ...
PIrelandatBC	717032610279649280	2016-04-04T16:54:30	1954swilliamson i actually have another paper on that! 
PIrelandatBC	717032403525623808	2016-04-04T16:53:41	1954swilliamson there's no reason not to expect faster reserve growth to translate into M growth

PIrelandatBC	717031966588198918	2016-04-04T16:51:57	1954swilliamson yes that is a problem: the fed may be working against itself by paying interest on reserves. but ...

PIrelandatBC	698998324926541826	2016-02-14T22:32:42	kocherlakota009 certainly, we can't take for granted anymore that low interest rates are a sure sign of accommodative monet policy
PIrelandatBC	698998074442649601	2016-02-14T22:31:42	kocherlakota009  ... so monet pol is too tight even though the yld is curve flat.  that could be happening here, too ...
PIrelandatBC	698997680027082753	2016-02-14T22:30:08	kocherlakota009 to me, the japan case is compelling, as regime chg that made the yld curve no longer a good indicator of monet pol ...
PIrelandatBC	698997020141420544	2016-02-14T22:27:30	kocherlakota009 ... all we would ask of the fed is that it track potential as closely as possible.
PIrelandatBC	698996865413554176	2016-02-14T22:26:54	kocherlakota009 yes, i see the point. but if you measure recessions w/the output gap, slow growth in potential matters less ...
PIrelandatBC	698995291282870275	2016-02-14T22:20:38	kocherlakota009 so the question boils down (as it so often does) to: has there been a regime change to make the reduced form unstable?  😀
PIrelandatBC	698994009147097088	2016-02-14T22:15:33	kocherlakota009 jmackin2 agreed, that is very interesting!
PIrelandatBC	698990825603211265	2016-02-14T22:02:54	kocherlakota009 point of graph is simply: people alarmed by flattening yld curve - true but not as much as in the past before recessions.
PIrelandatBC	698989722232844288	2016-02-14T21:58:31	kocherlakota009 point well taken. like you, i'm also quite hesitant to judge the stance of mp w/ reference to nominal rates alone ...
PIrelandatBC	698986693001678849	2016-02-14T21:46:28	kocherlakota009 good question! but wouldn't that tend to make the yld curve even flatter, by lowering LT rates even more?
PIrelandatBC	698982920653053953	2016-02-14T21:31:29	longer-term view: yld curve has flattened but 10y-2y spread not yet at levels that have presaged recession
