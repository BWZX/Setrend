jonlovett	709924039423184897	2016-03-16T02:07:35	At this point, it's not enough to just beat Trump. This man must be humiliated with a massive defeat.
jonlovett	709923213522935809	2016-03-16T02:04:18	If you work for Donald Trump and rough up a reporter, Trump will call the reporter a liar and bring you up on stage.

jonlovett	709898823309639680	2016-03-16T00:27:23	Rubio's story of America and Rubio's policy agenda for America had nothing to do with one another.
jonlovett	709896711808876546	2016-03-16T00:18:59	Rubio understands the frustration with wealthy elites and with politicians like Rubio proposing dramatic tax cuts for those elites.
jonlovett	709895869391376385	2016-03-16T00:15:39	SimonMaloy we've got to stop these elitists by decreasing their share of tax base
jonlovett	709894942966075392	2016-03-16T00:11:58	Rubio should have gone lower than zero percent on cap gains taxes.

jonlovett	708723991641513984	2016-03-12T18:39:01	jonlovett treating political violence as a contest of toughness is Trump bullshit
jonlovett	708722918453280769	2016-03-12T18:34:45	Cannot stand people debating whether Trump "flinched" at threat of violence, or was he very manly? It's not a masculinity excerise.
jonlovett	708465906238791680	2016-03-12T01:33:29	He's blaming Obama on Fox News. Just an FYI.

jonlovett	708130308491710464	2016-03-11T03:19:56	How to debate Trump when he's constantly spewing vague bullshit and doesn't mind lying and contradicting himself even inside of sentences?
jonlovett	708126962678669315	2016-03-11T03:06:38	Trump's prep binder for this debate is the comment section from Fox Nation and a picture of himself leading a parade.
jonlovett	708122976458252288	2016-03-11T02:50:48	Donald Trump is such a bad person.
jonlovett	708118929797996544	2016-03-11T02:34:43	Trump adapts like the Borg.
jonlovett	708115866135760896	2016-03-11T02:22:33	Sadly, Rubio's mother voted early for Trump last week.

jonlovett	707379931022360576	2016-03-09T01:38:12	Rubio is like an empty retail spot on a busy street that's perfect for a restaurant but no restaurant can make it work for some reason.

jonlovett	707303449063325696	2016-03-08T20:34:17	Not about winning but keeping Trump under 1237 and his lead modest enough so that Cruz is a plausible alternative.

jonlovett	705610746546139136	2016-03-04T04:28:06	That was the worst debate I've ever seen. Worst questions. Worst answers. Worst behavior.
jonlovett	705609573151801345	2016-03-04T04:23:26	Is Trump dangerous? Look at the damage he's doing to our country already as a candidate. And they'd all support him. What a disgrace.
