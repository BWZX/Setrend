davidgraeber	704803181964992513	2016-03-01T22:59:07	PennyGaff what's the logic? Then, 2nd, direct action generally means illegal. If a stranger walked up to you and said "hi you don't know me
davidgraeber	704802969234087937	2016-03-01T22:58:17	PennyGaff or is it that you think I'm smarter or more insightful than the people you already know or who are engaged in activist projects?

davidgraeber	704751573633781761	2016-03-01T19:34:03	LucianGeorge1 as a result, the claim is still being made, even though even AI no longer says it's true. There's a lot of this.
davidgraeber	704751459657768965	2016-03-01T19:33:36	LucianGeorge1 this happens a lot. AI claimed they did ethnic cleansing. They proved it false so AI w/drew the claim but didn't advertise it

davidgraeber	703938733679255552	2016-02-28T13:44:07	coalacroata but there's an obvious contradiction between that &amp; TevDem project of democratizing Syria as a whole.
davidgraeber	703938520092643328	2016-02-28T13:43:16	coalacroata ... because obviously they know the US is a broken reed &amp; will turn on them the moment it's convenient. Russians might not.
davidgraeber	703938403386200064	2016-02-28T13:42:48	coalacroata strategically, it's sensible to establish a long-term alliance with the Russians, &amp; hence temporarily with regime ...
davidgraeber	703938200155377666	2016-02-28T13:42:00	coalacroata it is. Obviously some FSA = scary Salafis but others aren't. PYD has had to play politics but the results aren't always pretty.

davidgraeber	703923144818561024	2016-02-28T12:42:10	arbetarsol filokalia 4rj1n this is true of a small minority is my impression
davidgraeber	703922689912803328	2016-02-28T12:40:22	filokalia arbetarsol 4rj1n you're not a Westerner?
davidgraeber	703922472278695936	2016-02-28T12:39:30	arbetarsol filokalia 4rj1n honestly I don't get what's the point of denying the existence of potential ... 
davidgraeber	703922335108222976	2016-02-28T12:38:57	arbetarsol filokalia 4rj1n most of the Islamists are just gangsters with zero interest in running electricity &amp; sewer systems etc
davidgraeber	703921459702460417	2016-02-28T12:35:28	arbetarsol filokalia 4rj1n the sharia councils are mostly extremely weak &amp; ineffective with unpleasant exceptions like Ildib
davidgraeber	703920976464093184	2016-02-28T12:33:33	arbetarsol filokalia 4rj1n I'm saying this as a strong &amp; consistent public supporter of the Kurdish movement; I want the project to win
davidgraeber	703920694984351745	2016-02-28T12:32:26	arbetarsol filokalia 4rj1n since you can't impose democracy by force insisting their are no Arab allies is a separatist position
davidgraeber	703920187666513920	2016-02-28T12:30:25	arbetarsol filokalia 4rj1n the guy who set up the first councils was actually a secular anarchist

davidgraeber	703919796505747457	2016-02-28T12:28:52	arbetarsol filokalia 4rj1n we don't differ about the insidious nature of the Islamic militias; but if you think the entire revolution...

davidgraeber	703917083596300288	2016-02-28T12:18:05	arbetarsol filokalia 4rj1n huh???? No it's like arguing a lot of things were going on in the Republic even after Stalinists took over
davidgraeber	703916382837198848	2016-02-28T12:15:18	arbetarsol filokalia 4rj1n what is your scenario for an ultimate success of that project?
davidgraeber	703915987272335360	2016-02-28T12:13:44	arbetarsol filokalia 4rj1n what are your views of the TevDem project inside Rojava?
davidgraeber	703914283546099712	2016-02-28T12:06:57	arbetarsol filokalia 4rj1n I'm curious what is your feelimg about TevDem?
davidgraeber	703913736264876033	2016-02-28T12:04:47	arbetarsol filokalia 4rj1n whatever you say boss
davidgraeber	703913582946344960	2016-02-28T12:04:10	arbetarsol filokalia 4rj1n but honestly any blanket statement like that in a revolutionary situation has got to be wrong
davidgraeber	703913428033904641	2016-02-28T12:03:33	arbetarsol filokalia 4rj1n there's definitely some areas they have inserted selves &amp; done terrible things
davidgraeber	703913240309469184	2016-02-28T12:02:49	arbetarsol filokalia 4rj1n true in a small minority of areas. Other than IS jihadis turn out to have little interest in civil admin
davidgraeber	703912610106892288	2016-02-28T12:00:18	Mwforhr NiceChess757 a lot of horizontal revolutionary civil institutions continue to function as Jahadists not interested in civil admin
davidgraeber	703909418585497601	2016-02-28T11:47:38	Mwforhr NiceChess757 I think there's a huge difference between the armed groups &amp; civil society groups
davidgraeber	703904129614286848	2016-02-28T11:26:37	filokalia 4rj1n US plan was original finally to let Daesh wipe out Kobane but we out-maneuvered them
davidgraeber	703903907311984640	2016-02-28T11:25:44	filokalia 4rj1n believe me I know
davidgraeber	703903823316783104	2016-02-28T11:25:24	Mwforhr NiceChess757 shot is she okay?
davidgraeber	703902945746817024	2016-02-28T11:21:54	filokalia 4rj1n that's the same logic people use to claim SDF are now US puppets which obviously isn't true
davidgraeber	703902591864991745	2016-02-28T11:20:30	Mwforhr NiceChess757 yes I'm waiting to see what the editor says
davidgraeber	703902514706513920	2016-02-28T11:20:12	filokalia 4rj1n obviously it can only be based on a convergence between democratic bottom-up institutions in both areas
davidgraeber	703902380966977536	2016-02-28T11:19:40	filokalia 4rj1n this will not happen through (a) Assad regime seizing rebel areas, or (b) YPG conquering the whole country. What then?
davidgraeber	703902227161858048	2016-02-28T11:19:03	filokalia 4rj1n I'm interested in TevDem being able to succeed in their project
davidgraeber	703902016477773824	2016-02-28T11:18:13	filokalia 4rj1n the Islamists all vary, some are total Takfiri worst of the worst, others happy to coexist with democratic institutions
davidgraeber	703901526318817281	2016-02-28T11:16:16	filokalia 4rj1n in some areas this is true. In others they're basically just a bunch of gangsters controlling the top of the economy.
davidgraeber	703901066459553792	2016-02-28T11:14:26	WASBAPPIN that's not my line and never was; you're just obviously too obsessive to notice I was reacting to YOUR one-sidedness
davidgraeber	703900518435971072	2016-02-28T11:12:16	filokalia 4rj1n actually in most areas the Islamists aren't even trying to set up civil admin institutions at all
davidgraeber	703900009767555072	2016-02-28T11:10:14	4rj1n Sozialchrist absolutely, the less importance force of arms has in the overall balance, the easier things will become
davidgraeber	703899791055523840	2016-02-28T11:09:22	4rj1n Sozialchrist this is interesting. It's a real dilemma I think.
davidgraeber	703897850292342784	2016-02-28T11:01:39	Elizrael @EDMkingFX iyad_elbaghdadi maybe info I got was out of date but it was eyewitness
davidgraeber	703897603734433793	2016-02-28T11:00:41	Sozialchrist 4rj1n my point is it isn't "had" those institutions are mostly still there as most Islamists aren't running civil admin
davidgraeber	703897313471799296	2016-02-28T10:59:31	Sozialchrist 4rj1n to ally with Arab communities they needed support of local leaders who are often literally patriarchs
davidgraeber	703897112753410048	2016-02-28T10:58:44	Sozialchrist 4rj1n maybe it's just a matter of needing time but it is a problem people talk about there
davidgraeber	703896951515959296	2016-02-28T10:58:05	Sozialchrist 4rj1n Arab women who wanted to do feminist education projects etc had to join the Assyrian women's group
davidgraeber	703896782519013376	2016-02-28T10:57:25	Sozialchrist 4rj1n when I was in Cezire they said the Arab community had all the institutions but the Women's Union
davidgraeber	703896456135057408	2016-02-28T10:56:07	Sozialchrist 4rj1n well not going to be through conquest obviously. If so how to bring around people already organizing along such lines?
davidgraeber	703896238039670785	2016-02-28T10:55:15	Sozialchrist 4rj1n I have no specific agenda here other than I want the broader TevDem project to win - how could that actually happen?
davidgraeber	703895904621891584	2016-02-28T10:53:56	Sozialchrist 4rj1n I don't know how to resolve this if "ideological diversity" has to mean accepting patriarchy that's a problem
davidgraeber	703895713504227328	2016-02-28T10:53:10	Sozialchrist 4rj1n I.e. Rojava is way better on gender but the councils in other areas are more ideologically diverse.
davidgraeber	703895414089654272	2016-02-28T10:51:59	Sozialchrist 4rj1n it'll be a real problem integrating the two models but Y-K made a strong case both have strengths
davidgraeber	703895159331758080	2016-02-28T10:50:58	filokalia 4rj1n in some places that's happened. In others women's centers are open &amp; active even under ostensible Islamist militias.
davidgraeber	703894910294953984	2016-02-28T10:49:59	filokalia 4rj1n there are 400-700 local councils by different accounts. It's all different in different regions, towns...
davidgraeber	703894584892506112	2016-02-28T10:48:41	Sozialchrist 4rj1n weird thing is even in many areas w Salafi militias, civil admin is totally different &amp; based on horizontal principles
davidgraeber	703894174215569408	2016-02-28T10:47:03	Sozialchrist 4rj1n I am thinking of places that already have forms of revolutionary self-government &amp; how they're integrated (or not)
davidgraeber	703893626066243585	2016-02-28T10:44:52	filokalia 4rj1n I fully support the TevDem project I'm trying to see how it can be integrated w parallel Arab revolutionary institutions
davidgraeber	703893270322085888	2016-02-28T10:43:28	filokalia 4rj1n one reason is most Islamists (other than Daesh) aren't even trying to set up their own civil administration
davidgraeber	703893080966045696	2016-02-28T10:42:42	filokalia 4rj1n curiously a lot of these women's centers continue to exist in theoretically Salafi (tho not AQ) territories
davidgraeber	703892874212024320	2016-02-28T10:41:53	filokalia 4rj1n there are still revolutionary civil institutions continuing to exist - assemblies, women's centers - in such areas
davidgraeber	703892622247641088	2016-02-28T10:40:53	filokalia 4rj1n problem is a lot of these aren't AQ areas - Salafis have done very poorly at brainwashing in many areas they do control
davidgraeber	703845439120912385	2016-02-28T07:33:24	in US 1 in 5 kids r hungry. Moms work full-time but pay gap keeps them poor EqualMeansEqual

davidgraeber	703860865167073281	2016-02-28T08:34:42	4rj1n no he emphasised he thought what happened in Tel Abyad was a model, he just thought working with Russians in W undermined this

davidgraeber	703860096850219008	2016-02-28T08:31:38	4rj1n this all makes sense &amp; I understand the alliance with Russians is long-term strategic as the US will surely sell them out

davidgraeber	703849803415814144	2016-02-28T07:50:44	arbetarsol I guess the question is does one support the TevDem project of rebuilding Syria on Democratic Confederalist lines?

davidgraeber	693853740181405696	2016-01-31T17:49:57	monasherry still it led to a situation where in 19C all male kings tried to replace the system &amp; were instantly faced with women's revolts
davidgraeber	693853469904637952	2016-01-31T17:48:53	monasherry the system actually precluded capitalist relations &amp; centered on caring but it was obviously oppressive in its own way
davidgraeber	693853227956199426	2016-01-31T17:47:55	monasherry if the king is egocentric throws tantrums etc etc the response is to say there there and react with affection not rage
davidgraeber	693853062516072450	2016-01-31T17:47:15	monasherry piece is about Malagasy ideas of kings as big babies, caring labor is mobilized to win popular acquiescence

davidgraeber	693432241284866049	2016-01-30T13:55:04	JanOfftin well the campaign contributions point is relevant, but they said that about Obama at first too. Then things changed.

davidgraeber	693392795206316036	2016-01-30T11:18:19	JanOfftin if followers of a politician say they're what an anti-politician mvmt was leading to, u can't expect people not to point that out
davidgraeber	693392408827072512	2016-01-30T11:16:47	JanOfftin he held a rally in Zuccotti Park with dozens of people saying this is the outcome of OWS. Sorry. She didn't make that up.
davidgraeber	693392191817945088	2016-01-30T11:15:55	JanOfftin now you're starting to lose me &amp; convince me you're an arrogant clueless person, might have to mute
davidgraeber	693392076134858752	2016-01-30T11:15:28	JanOfftin yes extensive - you can disagree, but saying that position is simply ignorant simply shows you to be utterly ignorant.
davidgraeber	693391911974014976	2016-01-30T11:14:49	JanOfftin argument Marisa made, echoing many OWS declarations, was that the structure is so corrupt a politician's intentions don't matter
davidgraeber	693391717807046656	2016-01-30T11:14:02	JanOfftin that you see the issue as about him as a person is exactly the problem
davidgraeber	693390104770015232	2016-01-30T11:07:38	JanOfftin she wasn't not passing judgment on him as a person - she's saying that who he is as a person is not the point.
