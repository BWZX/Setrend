brokeymcpoverty	720238546422894592	2016-04-13T13:13:45	poke me and my company all you want but do *not* attack the black folks in my office like you know something bc you dont, i promise you.
brokeymcpoverty	720237892866428933	2016-04-13T13:11:09	the rest of us do not. so yes its absolutely unfair to blame all of us for 1 vid. absolutely. absolutely.  LeLeGiggles
brokeymcpoverty	720237660967538690	2016-04-13T13:10:14	and again these are TWO DIFFERENT COMPANIES. there are like 4 black ppl who work for buzzfeed motion pictures LeLeGiggles
brokeymcpoverty	720237431446843392	2016-04-13T13:09:19	this doesnt make any sense at all. 
brokeymcpoverty	720237349972484098	2016-04-13T13:09:00	you do not know what its like being black at buzzfeed.  stop acting like we're not human and dont feel shit, that's absurd LeLeGiggles
brokeymcpoverty	720237203381559296	2016-04-13T13:08:25	so what? this is a thought that multiple ppl are having and after reading it for the 10000th time i might feel a way 
brokeymcpoverty	720237058862678017	2016-04-13T13:07:50	i swear i didnt get mad about this until people started coming directly for the people i labor with everyday.
brokeymcpoverty	720236975408553985	2016-04-13T13:07:30	also, you dont know that we're NOT yelling at our company. you dont know what happens behind the scenes &amp; you dont know us. LeLeGiggles
brokeymcpoverty	720236842403045376	2016-04-13T13:06:59	okay, you're wrong. your interpretation is completely wrong. 
brokeymcpoverty	720236390865174528	2016-04-13T13:05:11	im human and a tweet touched my eyeball and i responded and reacted to it to please trust me, im asking for nothing 
brokeymcpoverty	720236286099914752	2016-04-13T13:04:46	because im not! ppl are asking me for an explanation like i own or run the company or made the video or okayed it! 
brokeymcpoverty	720236176146214913	2016-04-13T13:04:20	im not asking anyone to stop feeling their feelings bc i know exactly how that is LeLeGiggles
brokeymcpoverty	720236100103475200	2016-04-13T13:04:02	so i pointed it out and said it was unfair and went on my way. im not asking anyone for shit, i made a point LeLeGiggles
brokeymcpoverty	720236018780102656	2016-04-13T13:03:42	ppl who didnt make that fucking video, ppl whose good work gets ignored whenever something bad happens  lelegiggles

brokeymcpoverty	720235329001623552	2016-04-13T13:00:58	sis, you are being loud and wrong about *so many things* right now.

brokeymcpoverty	719587898387992576	2016-04-11T18:08:18	thanks very much, leon. i appreciate that    leoncrawl
brokeymcpoverty	719587513103486976	2016-04-11T18:06:47	brokeymcpoverty rereading my sentence, i see i implied you and your producers do less work than other pods. i didn’t mean to and i'm sorry.
brokeymcpoverty	719587452432871424	2016-04-11T18:06:32	brokeymcpoverty hi tracy. i made an unfair assumption here. as others have said, you make it sound easy. (1/2)
brokeymcpoverty	719585967795998720	2016-04-11T18:00:38	I’ve seen heavenrants and brokeymcpoverty in the studio. Trust me, it’s work: for them, for the producers, and the studio supervisor.
brokeymcpoverty	719585102494359554	2016-04-11T17:57:12	I'm just gonna give up on seeing the day when black women's work is valued as highly as it should be. There will always be a "but".
brokeymcpoverty	719584540562427905	2016-04-11T17:54:58	tnwhiskeywoman leoncrawl right? like why would we NOT research to interview hillary freaking clinton?
brokeymcpoverty	719584392482590722	2016-04-11T17:54:23	brokeymcpoverty low touch deez. How bout THAT?
brokeymcpoverty	719584248005599233	2016-04-11T17:53:48	we research and prep *so hard* for our interviews.  
brokeymcpoverty	719583660513427456	2016-04-11T17:51:28	ugh ty this means so much, I've stayed up till 5 am making an Asian-American show that nets me negative $100/yr rn 
brokeymcpoverty	719583438840401920	2016-04-11T17:50:35	pow! 
brokeymcpoverty	719583397396525058	2016-04-11T17:50:25	im not gon sit by and let someone devalue the work they do, ever.
brokeymcpoverty	719583088515366913	2016-04-11T17:49:12	i also want to add that our producers do the BULK of the heavy lifting, so its false that this show is carried by its charismatic hosts.
brokeymcpoverty	719582305887633408	2016-04-11T17:46:05	shout out to all the podcasters out there in the trenches, skipping dinner, living at the office, scrambling for funding. we see you.
brokeymcpoverty	719582171200102400	2016-04-11T17:45:33	so there's that. but the idea that this takes little effort or that a podcasts production is 'low touch' just bc its a podcast is wrooooong.
brokeymcpoverty	719582041390628864	2016-04-11T17:45:02	again, though, the fact that the show sounds effortless mean that we are really, really, REALLY fucking good at what we do.
brokeymcpoverty	719581805276487680	2016-04-11T17:44:06	i mean he assumed he knows how our show is made &amp; what it takes to make it without asking a single one of us, so.. 
brokeymcpoverty	719581439558356993	2016-04-11T17:42:39	right. 
brokeymcpoverty	719581301796417536	2016-04-11T17:42:06	mia_sade LOVE
brokeymcpoverty	719581218824667136	2016-04-11T17:41:46	i really want to know what podcasters, if any, he spoke to to find out how much work goes into making them.
brokeymcpoverty	719580921133981696	2016-04-11T17:40:35	bc we dont have the public radio voice or sound. meanwhile the #1 question we get asked by public radio is 'how do you do it?!'
brokeymcpoverty	719580776715698177	2016-04-11T17:40:00	nobody knows what we do. they see 'podcast' and foo foo it away.
brokeymcpoverty	719580718867853312	2016-04-11T17:39:47	the frustrating thing is that i know that leon is not the only person who thinks this way. nearly EVERYbody does.
brokeymcpoverty	719580583643451393	2016-04-11T17:39:14	and i cant help but think about that fact that spaces where brown people are allowed to have voices are often deemed 'lowly' in some way.
brokeymcpoverty	719580407675625472	2016-04-11T17:38:33	podcasts are accessible. that does not mean 'easy to make' or 'low touch,' leoncrawl. especially ours. *especially* ours.
brokeymcpoverty	719580245918134272	2016-04-11T17:37:54	we dont have teams of 20-25 people spending months at a time on one episode. we are 6 women turning shit around FAST every week.
brokeymcpoverty	719580101688631298	2016-04-11T17:37:20	add to this the fact that most podcasts do this with a teeny tiny team bc we're constantly fighting for the validity of our work
brokeymcpoverty	719579930258993154	2016-04-11T17:36:39	that our podcast sounds effortless just means that we have amazing fucking producers who go above &amp; beyond every single day.
brokeymcpoverty	719579762658820097	2016-04-11T17:35:59	ppl legit think that you just walk into a studio, talk for 2 hours, click a few buttons and its done. that is completely untrue. leoncrawl
brokeymcpoverty	719579451579883520	2016-04-11T17:34:45	this is clearly a man who has absolutely, positively no idea what it takes to produce a podcast. we toil. we sweat and we cry. we *work.*
brokeymcpoverty	719579214366785536	2016-04-11T17:33:48	so here's what leoncrawl got wrong in calling podcasts, ours by name, 'low-touch productions:' everything.

brokeymcpoverty	703622279867944960	2016-02-27T16:46:38	Aye, man. We know we're all expendable. But if MHP is expendable, then we're *really* all expendable.
brokeymcpoverty	703624324952027136	2016-02-27T16:54:46	YadLladnek nah it was just the one
brokeymcpoverty	703624217200369664	2016-02-27T16:54:20	im also hypersensitive to black folk's woes in white media bc this shit is a battlefield.
brokeymcpoverty	703623862622265349	2016-02-27T16:52:56	&amp; this isnt me shaming anybody who's like 'nah sorry cant rock with her.' i will never tell anyone how to feel
brokeymcpoverty	703623739372658688	2016-02-27T16:52:26	i still dont agree with her thoughts or much of the language she used or that interview, but i was like 'oh, i get it'
brokeymcpoverty	703623487022354433	2016-02-27T16:51:26	idk if redeemed is the word id use; i understood her actions better &amp; that understanding made me less uncomfy 
brokeymcpoverty	703623345393291264	2016-02-27T16:50:52	at the end. but they never got to it. so, idk
brokeymcpoverty	703623199481839616	2016-02-27T16:50:18	someone had listened to the first part of the interview and tweeted me saying 'none of that stuff made it okay.' but she herself said that +
brokeymcpoverty	703623103612526592	2016-02-27T16:49:55	i honestly agree. 
brokeymcpoverty	703623056103751681	2016-02-27T16:49:43	i get it tho. i totally get it, and im not here to tell folk how to feel.  but as for me and my house, i StandWithNerdland.
brokeymcpoverty	703622752373227520	2016-02-27T16:48:31	i do remember some folk tweeting me like 'this interview was horrible, i didnt listen to it!'  but if you didnt listen to it... lol
brokeymcpoverty	703622679904067585	2016-02-27T16:48:14	and again, her interview on 'another round' totally did that for me. lots of ppl didnt give it/her a chance, and i get why.
brokeymcpoverty	703622299983998976	2016-02-27T16:46:43	im trying to practice the whole 'black ppl/women contain multitudes' thing i always be preaching. we can differ on things &amp; still rock
brokeymcpoverty	703621882210357248	2016-02-27T16:45:04	when one black person in white media gets fucked over its a symptom of other bs happening that we cant see.
brokeymcpoverty	703621691721838594	2016-02-27T16:44:18	if theyre treating MHP like shit there, they're treating their other POCs wrong too. i dont stop caring abt them bc of a differing opinion
brokeymcpoverty	703621389815709696	2016-02-27T16:43:06	i also know explicitly, EXPLICITLY, how it feels to be a token. even if id abandoned the show completely, id still side with her.
brokeymcpoverty	703621212954615808	2016-02-27T16:42:24	for me tho, her very human answer abt her very human response she gave on our show eased that discomfort. (its here )
brokeymcpoverty	703621002668994560	2016-02-27T16:41:34	i get folk being so put off by the dolezal thing to have stopped watching. im down w/ letting ppl feel how they feel.

brokeymcpoverty	702538014686363649	2016-02-24T16:58:09	okay. folks who are wallowing &amp; hiding from the world like me, let's do this:   get up shower dress.  just those 3 things. that's it.

brokeymcpoverty	702517207054557184	2016-02-24T15:35:28	a thing im getting better at is not punishing myself for being sad and needing time to let things not suck anymore. long way to go tho.
brokeymcpoverty	702516943526498304	2016-02-24T15:34:26	or you busy yourself enough not to notice it, but you always do when you stand still. and you always have to stand still eventually.
brokeymcpoverty	702516764756877313	2016-02-24T15:33:43	and so you either ignore the panic you feel each time you take a step in this new weird ass land or you accept it as normal
brokeymcpoverty	702516402910003201	2016-02-24T15:32:17	lits also very disorienting when the person who is supposed to protect you from hurr becomes the cause of it. the ground feels different.
brokeymcpoverty	702515467051790336	2016-02-24T15:28:34	1130 am is a perfectly acceptable time to open a bottle of wine, right
brokeymcpoverty	702515351888785408	2016-02-24T15:28:06	nothing like knowing/thinking/feeling like the person making you miserable is likely fine and happy and not thinking abt you at all
