pattonoswalt	694720062725316610	2016-02-03T03:12:24	Nah. Just do way more sets &amp; get funnier. Everything else is just stalling.  
pattonoswalt	694717337128214528	2016-02-03T03:01:35	It doesn't matter if they hate you. It's your job to win crowds over. Be yourself &amp; add funny to it. Okay?  
pattonoswalt	694715431781699584	2016-02-03T02:54:00	No. Become so funny that even if people are offended they can't help laughing.

pattonoswalt	693837222055940096	2016-01-31T16:44:19	It's pretty much just me &amp; EricIdle, to be honest. SteveMartinToGo knows paintings and banjo.  
pattonoswalt	693829888856473600	2016-01-31T16:15:10	Yep. Quite a trick inserting laughs that propel plot &amp; feed character instead of slowing the action to take a bow.  
pattonoswalt	693826527935512576	2016-01-31T16:01:49	We both started wanting to be writers, I think. And that goal abided. Eric? Is that at all accurate?  
pattonoswalt	693826068483084288	2016-01-31T16:00:00	No. He has massive shoulders and fills doorways. He takes out two Saudia Arabian bodyguards in FLYNN. 
pattonoswalt	693825601824759812	2016-01-31T15:58:08	NO. Especially not FLETCH REFLECTED. Same goes for those Skylar books. 
pattonoswalt	693822773592985600	2016-01-31T15:46:54	Yes. That chapter in itself would be an excellent stand-alone short story.  
pattonoswalt	693821598776889344	2016-01-31T15:42:14	I know!!! Ugh! Also he tries to seduce &amp; mind-fuck his ex-wife's gay lawyer. Just now remembered that, too. 
pattonoswalt	693820968381325312	2016-01-31T15:39:44	Absolutely. It's an amazing novel &amp; a mystery that "plays fair" if you pay attention.  
pattonoswalt	693820249817354240	2016-01-31T15:36:52	Oh my God. The cringe-y slavery moralizing when he's in Africa. Yikes.  
pattonoswalt	693819611242979328	2016-01-31T15:34:20	Yep. You can basically read it in a morning (which I did). Very breezy but kind of a moral vacuum.  
pattonoswalt	693802482540154880	2016-01-31T14:26:16	Yes, with RIPLEY UNDER WATER being the best (IMO). 
pattonoswalt	693802229590003712	2016-01-31T14:25:16	I like CONFESS, FLETCH &amp; the first FLYNN novel. CARIOCA FLETCH stinks, sorry. A ghost?!? 
pattonoswalt	693801751217074176	2016-01-31T14:23:22	The novel FLETCH (and some of the sequels) is terrific, by the way. But Fletch is NOT a lovable goof. He's damaged &amp; slippery.
pattonoswalt	693801383544381441	2016-01-31T14:21:54	Also? FLETCH is basically a SoCal TALENTED MR. RIPLEY. And unlike the film, Fletch takes the 2mil, flees to Rio, &amp; vanishes (for awhile).
pattonoswalt	693799361290072064	2016-01-31T14:13:52	(2/2) And Fletch laughs about "busting virgins" and brags to his boss about Bobbi's "tight, compact little body." Eeesh.
pattonoswalt	693798952370573312	2016-01-31T14:12:15	(1/2) Just re-read FLETCH. I forgot how, in the original novel, he's living with (and fucking) a 15 year-old heroin junkie named Bobbi.

pattonoswalt	689902109072863232	2016-01-20T20:07:35	And if SarahPalinUSA is so concerned about how soldiers are coming back "so hardened," maybe her party should stop sending us. politico

pattonoswalt	689901658084487169	2016-01-20T20:05:47	All that does is make people who don't understand vets think we're all capable of that. SarahPalinUSA politico
pattonoswalt	689901411690151936	2016-01-20T20:04:48	Her son committed domestic violence and she holds him up saying "This is what war does to you." No, fuck that. SarahPalinUSA politico
pattonoswalt	689901208631271424	2016-01-20T20:04:00	Second, what she just did there proagates the stereotype we fight so hard of the "crazy, dangerous war veteran." SarahPalinUSA politico
pattonoswalt	689900916116316160	2016-01-20T20:02:50	OMFG, SarahPalinUSA is the goddamned worst. First, even if her son HAS PTSD, that doesn't excuse his actions.

pattonoswalt	690315869289742336	2016-01-21T23:31:43	You can reach Agent Paul and Officers Johnson and Debbie at 240-523-3767.
pattonoswalt	690315465562796033	2016-01-21T23:30:07	And I've thought about it, and I don't accept his apologies.
pattonoswalt	690315294149967874	2016-01-21T23:29:26	Agent Paul, I swear to God, said: "Please accept my apologies," and hung up the phone.
pattonoswalt	690315177800007680	2016-01-21T23:28:58	...somewhere out there, someone better is going to con YOU, and you're too dumb to see it coming. GO. FUCK. YOURSELF.
pattonoswalt	690315018265432066	2016-01-21T23:28:20	I hope you never get another good night's sleep, not because you are bad, but because you are TERRIBLE AT BEING A CON ARTIST, and
pattonoswalt	690314820780822528	2016-01-21T23:27:33	You are BAD AT GRIFTING, and you should STOP IT.
pattonoswalt	690314558758526976	2016-01-21T23:26:30	It says: this is the worst, sloppiest, saddest attempt at a con I have ever experienced, and you should be ashamed.
pattonoswalt	690314308853493760	2016-01-21T23:25:31	And then I passed my destination and decided to circle it for a minute. I said: please let me read it to you.
pattonoswalt	690314033145098240	2016-01-21T23:24:25	Agent Paul, said, with palpable enthusiasm and relief: You DID? And no, I don't need to read what's on the receipt.
pattonoswalt	690313524216619008	2016-01-21T23:22:24	Opened/closed the door again (I am driving during this, btw) and said: I've done it. I have my receipt. May I read it to you?
pattonoswalt	690313340602613760	2016-01-21T23:21:40	Opened/closed the car door, thought long and hard about a car-theft plot twist with all new characters, but my destination was close.
pattonoswalt	690312939903909888	2016-01-21T23:20:04	So I thanked Agent Paul, told him how crisp and professional Officers Johnson and Debbie had been, and went into the bank to transact.
pattonoswalt	690312738929664001	2016-01-21T23:19:17	Agent Paul said: I don't think you should do that. I said: Bluetooth gets weird though. He couldn't really argue with that.
pattonoswalt	690312250683355136	2016-01-21T23:17:20	I'm going to keep the Bluetooth connected, leave the phone in the car, and keep the car running in the parking lot while I do this.
pattonoswalt	690312121163198464	2016-01-21T23:16:49	I said: I want to make sure we don't get disconnected, so here's what I'm going to do.
pattonoswalt	690311916086923264	2016-01-21T23:16:00	He said: you are not allowed to do that. This is a federal case, and talking about it is illegal. I said: that makes perfect sense.
pattonoswalt	690311718006689792	2016-01-21T23:15:13	I said: I'll be sure to tell the teller it's for the IRS, so that he or she is extra careful with the numbers and whatnot.
pattonoswalt	690311558937767936	2016-01-21T23:14:35	I said: fire away. He gave me an account and routing numbers into which to deposit my money. The name on the account: JACK MILTON.
pattonoswalt	690311250882879488	2016-01-21T23:13:22	I was then transferred to a guy who announced himself simply as "Agent Paul." Agent Paul was going to give me the account info.
pattonoswalt	690310988231503873	2016-01-21T23:12:19	Officer Debbie then put me on hold, and a bunch of assholes with a burner phone reenacted this performance probably: 
pattonoswalt	690310292178239488	2016-01-21T23:09:33	I said: Officer Debbie, isn't it great to be alive in a time when all of this is so easy and intuitive? She agreed that it is.
pattonoswalt	690309860752142336	2016-01-21T23:07:50	Officer Debbie told me I needed to go to a Bank of America and deposit the cash into an account whose number they would give me.
pattonoswalt	690309502097162240	2016-01-21T23:06:25	I was then transferred to his boss, an agent with the same accent who identified herself only as "Officer Debbie."
pattonoswalt	690309349307056129	2016-01-21T23:05:48	He then put me on hold, during which I would imagine there was a 30-second shitty grifter office party.
pattonoswalt	690309110806347776	2016-01-21T23:04:51	I returned to the car, and I said: "Officer Johnson, I have $5300 in a paper bag. Tell me what to do next." He said: hold on.
pattonoswalt	690308849127960576	2016-01-21T23:03:49	So I pretended to go into the bank (opened/closed my car door, improvised the whole transaction with a teller voice, THANK YOU! the whole 9)
