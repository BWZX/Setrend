hmeisler	725723294305898496	2016-04-28T16:28:11	sharkbiotech 2016 is the inverse of 2015. shall i repeat that one more time:)
hmeisler	725721281069338624	2016-04-28T16:20:11	BassDefense in all seriousness DRYS is the JDSU of this market. sharkbiotech said it once &amp; he's been right.
hmeisler	725720476325011457	2016-04-28T16:16:59	joshysam sharkbiotech why does that matter? all that matters is that they tell us afterwards what a great trade they had!
hmeisler	725719753461886976	2016-04-28T16:14:07	Note to followers: this is not the time to follow me. I stink in one direction markets. Just mute me
hmeisler	725719413794594817	2016-04-28T16:12:46	AutonomousRoark zozotrader put this in the category of things I did not hear in February.
hmeisler	725718953184485376	2016-04-28T16:10:56	mark_dow yes but if you own it you are not outperforming the spx so not sure that will be a discussion. might be more like u dont own FCX?!
hmeisler	725718223979581440	2016-04-28T16:08:02	mark_dow it's the same price it was in early Feb.
hmeisler	725717211675942912	2016-04-28T16:04:01	sharkbiotech out by 9:35. nailed it
hmeisler	725717105115459584	2016-04-28T16:03:35	sharkbiotech of course, but he sold the high this AM
hmeisler	725716931471249408	2016-04-28T16:02:54	"How can you not own this stock" Wapner asks re FB.
hmeisler	725716737707012096	2016-04-28T16:02:08	BassDefense DRYS????????? oh my. if they run URRE we'll really know :)

hmeisler	725715908388253696	2016-04-28T15:58:50	kaoticanomaly oh sure. i think we saw a 9 handle a few years back.
hmeisler	725715817455722496	2016-04-28T15:58:28	BassDefense oh today doesnt feel like machines. today feels like folks. why else would CLF and MU, both POSs be flying?
hmeisler	725712838715535360	2016-04-28T15:46:38	Okay now I know it's ridiculous. And I like MU. 
hmeisler	725711849639923713	2016-04-28T15:42:42	Stuff like this seems to have jumped into my stream today 
hmeisler	725711756887089152	2016-04-28T15:42:20	I don't know what it is but I looked up and just saw all these 'strong market' type tweets.
hmeisler	725710964000055296	2016-04-28T15:39:11	Wow. In the last 5 mins my entire stream has become pound the chest types about the uptrend.

hmeisler	711180622534811648	2016-03-19T13:20:48	Great chart to study. SPX to Naz

hmeisler	711176586595205122	2016-03-19T13:04:45	IvanTheK yes. for me it's also higher highs show more momentum/positives

hmeisler	711174557722251264	2016-03-19T12:56:42	IvanTheK if stock trades green volume is counted as up. if it trades red, then it's down. simplistic but useful.
hmeisler	711174255971446784	2016-03-19T12:55:30	derek_sojek do you read my columns on realmoney?
hmeisler	711174081110876160	2016-03-19T12:54:48	IvanTheK not an 'index' like SPX or RUT. It's a measure of breadth using volume. more upside volume vol than down makes it go up.
