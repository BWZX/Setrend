gregclaeys	712994812773974016	2016-03-24T13:29:44	fwred links? I’m mostly on your side, but still the European banking sector’s health could be a negative for a large TLTRO take up in June
gregclaeys	712993189905502209	2016-03-24T13:23:17	mxsba fwred ???
gregclaeys	712993086532624385	2016-03-24T13:22:53	fwred concerning the demand for credit I think the last ECB bank lending survey points to higher demand imo, but for capital and NPLs?
gregclaeys	712992508779880448	2016-03-24T13:20:35	fwred ie banks don’t have enough capital, too much NPL, &amp; not enough demand for credit from firms and HH, what do you answer to this? 2/2
gregclaeys	712992015928131588	2016-03-24T13:18:38	fwred I agree and also think recent criticism of TLTRO2 are too extreme, but your piece doesn’t really answer to the critics’ arguments 1/2

gregclaeys	707925453328277504	2016-03-10T13:45:55	francescopapad1 exactly, so it doesn’t even compensate fully the cost of additional reserves created for TLTROs

gregclaeys	707924315631722496	2016-03-10T13:41:24	francescopapad1 it doesn’t exactly pay banks, this just compensate negative rates on reserves at the ECB

gregclaeys	707922053760946176	2016-03-10T13:32:24	codendahl true
gregclaeys	707921584539967490	2016-03-10T13:30:32	codendahl that’s already the case: QE as long as inflation not on the path towards target of close but below 2%
gregclaeys	707915644746997762	2016-03-10T13:06:56	fwred what do you mean?
gregclaeys	707915072987914240	2016-03-10T13:04:40	fwred true for reserves created through TLTRO but not for reserves created through QE
gregclaeys	707914764782084097	2016-03-10T13:03:27	smerler yep we should create a bank together (GS sounds well) to get these TLTRO at neg rates
gregclaeys	707914314800361473	2016-03-10T13:01:39	codendahl fwred true, even though I never read anything from the ECB on how they checked that for past TLTROs, but I might have missed it
gregclaeys	707914013309607936	2016-03-10T13:00:27	codendahl fwred luckily banks still have access to €500 bills ;-)
gregclaeys	707913206476447744	2016-03-10T12:57:15	codendahl fwred so basically as a bank I go to the ECB ask for €1000 billion in TLTRO, store in cash, get €4bn/yr, give back the 1000 ;-)
gregclaeys	707911561499828224	2016-03-10T12:50:43	fwred « as low as the interest rate on the deposit facility », so even lower than 0% no?

gregclaeys	702539075283263490	2016-02-24T17:02:22	jonathanalgar francescopapad1 5_min_macro fwred the loss argument is erroneous if you push it to the extreme case …
gregclaeys	702538519676321793	2016-02-24T17:00:10	jonathanalgar francescopapad1 5_min_macro fwred totally agree with that statement, losses shouldn’t prevent ECB from fulfilling mandate
gregclaeys	702514582179487744	2016-02-24T15:25:03	fwred francescopapad1 perfect, in that case it’s even easier to drop that rule
gregclaeys	702514133422501888	2016-02-24T15:23:16	fwred francescopapad1 yes, I think it is to avoid making ‘direct losses’ on reserves created to buy bonds, isn’t it?
gregclaeys	702513415152144384	2016-02-24T15:20:24	fwred francescopapad1 I also think removing floor would be good &amp; idea behind it is erroneous. Did the ECB ever explicitly mention it btw?
