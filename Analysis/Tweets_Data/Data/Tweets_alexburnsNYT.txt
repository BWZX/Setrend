alexburnsNYT	713463748867006464	2016-03-25T20:33:07	benmarcus Also, ballot access laws were not the ultimate hurdle for Nader. The problem was very few people actually wanted to vote for him.

alexburnsNYT	713462997503647744	2016-03-25T20:30:08	benmarcus But you're asking that marginal candidates be covered as though we have a European-style voting system. We simply do not.
alexburnsNYT	713462891039571968	2016-03-25T20:29:43	benmarcus We do not have a parliamentary system. We do not have runoffs. If someone organized a crusade for those, media would cover it.
alexburnsNYT	713462607928229888	2016-03-25T20:28:35	benmarcus Yes. Covered it repeatedly, most recently in the context of Bloomberg's 2016 preparations.
alexburnsNYT	713461603954515969	2016-03-25T20:24:36	benmarcus If there were a major movement to empower small parties, media would be responsible for covering it. No such movement exists.
alexburnsNYT	713461255722258432	2016-03-25T20:23:13	benmarcus Talking about 2000. Anyone can mount a protest candidacy. Covering spoiler implications is appropriate and fair.
alexburnsNYT	713460938184196097	2016-03-25T20:21:57	benmarcus It's not the media's job to change the landscape in favor of minor parties
alexburnsNYT	713460836501741568	2016-03-25T20:21:33	benmarcus Not really! Easiest way to get eyeballs is goading marginal candidates to say kooky stuff, rather than treating them as marginal.
alexburnsNYT	713460204818538496	2016-03-25T20:19:02	.ErikWemple on Jeff Lord &gt;  
alexburnsNYT	713459576826425344	2016-03-25T20:16:33	benmarcus Ballot access &amp; minor-party exclusion are valid issues, but they won't be resolved by candidates winning a few % of the vote
alexburnsNYT	713459117168439297	2016-03-25T20:14:43	benmarcus If a candidate can't describe a plausible path to victory, I don't see why we should pretend they have one
alexburnsNYT	713455643160670208	2016-03-25T20:00:55	benmarcus Sure, which means that in our system, the most relevant Q to ask a marginal candidate like Nader is: aren't you a spoiler?

alexburnsNYT	712764237618159616	2016-03-23T22:13:31	drgurner if you think critical scrutiny of a major candidate is "clicks over ethics," then buddy, I can't help you
alexburnsNYT	712764009317933057	2016-03-23T22:12:36	drgurner right -- and it doesn't mean what you want it to mean. It makes the *opposite* point. He is terribly unpopular.

alexburnsNYT	712763598989230080	2016-03-23T22:10:59	drgurner no, because that's a nonsensical comparison for a political candidate whose views you find objectionable
alexburnsNYT	712763083526172672	2016-03-23T22:08:56	drgurner context matters: that would be the worst performance of any presidential candidate in a quarter century

alexburnsNYT	712761608389464069	2016-03-23T22:03:04	drgurner "truth" is what a paper like NYT provides w/scrutiny of Trump. You would deny info to voters on false pretext of protecting them.
