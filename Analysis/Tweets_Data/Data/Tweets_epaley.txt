epaley	714464077079154693	2016-03-28T14:48:04	The winemakers love it because it allows their wine to always be tasted as it is intended. Not after loss of quality

epaley	694222159011528704	2016-02-01T18:13:55	arampell agreed. Most players chase margin and become client-service agencies, pretending to be tech companies. But exceptions exist...
