politicoroger	703781390438023168	2016-02-28T03:18:53	Very true. 
politicoroger	703780941144170496	2016-02-28T03:17:06	True, it has been a dispiriting evening, but if Sanders sounded any more dispirited, his chin actually would be on the floor.
politicoroger	703779592868220928	2016-02-28T03:11:45	But it shows how an enormous victory does not net you enormous number of delegates under Dem rules. 
politicoroger	703777722355548160	2016-02-28T03:04:19	"This is a rigged economy," Sanders says. "Heads they win, tails you lose." All from stump speech so far.

politicoroger	703773579536699392	2016-02-28T02:47:51	Sanders giving his stump speech. Tonight's results might suggest he needs new stump speech.
politicoroger	703771184140259328	2016-02-28T02:38:20	Sanders: "You are living under a corrupt campaign finance system that is undermining democracy." Mr. Sunshine.

politicoroger	703694831621636096	2016-02-27T21:34:56	Trump: "When it comes to business, I know what I'm doing." Doesn't a president have to know other stuff, too?

politicoroger	703294142575677440	2016-02-26T19:02:44	Trump is feeling his oats today. He believes nobody can touch him. He believes it's all over.
