_mades	708466676937965568	2016-03-12T01:36:33	sacca when the government can do something other than name a post office then realDonaldTrump doesn't exist
_mades	708466409836302336	2016-03-12T01:35:29	We blame realDonaldTrump for systemic problems. People are fed up with people refusing to do their jobs.
_mades	708465228065931264	2016-03-12T01:30:47	the equivalent would be hacking one gun and making sure all further makes couldn't fire a specific bullet type

_mades	694968312581771265	2016-02-03T19:38:52	dasan yea you're right.
_mades	694968117777321984	2016-02-03T19:38:05	dasan the good news is that this theory won't be priced in for a while - news media is all "Why is AMZN being dumb buying stores?"
_mades	694967657959985152	2016-02-03T19:36:16	dasan In order to receive the service you need to sign a $100 upfront contract (pure profit, Costco model)
_mades	694967375440035841	2016-02-03T19:35:08	dasan They'll then be able to have near perfect inventory for fast moving items pre-delivered and destroy all other retailers
_mades	694967228190613504	2016-02-03T19:34:33	dasan They're already testing 1hr delivery in a couple of markets. If that's successful they'll need mini distribution centres
_mades	694967031691616257	2016-02-03T19:33:46	dasan AMZN knows purchases go up with reduced time to delivery. They're testing 1hr delivery for Prime.

_mades	694927697370292224	2016-02-03T16:57:28	dasan am I the only one who thinks it's a good idea?
_mades	694901099422212097	2016-02-03T15:11:47	dasan The store will yield more sales than any other store in the world with barely any foot traffic. Employees will be pickers AMZN
_mades	694900704822059010	2016-02-03T15:10:13	dasan Prime which drives ~$6B revenue right now. This begins to create a moat no other retailer can match.
_mades	694900368598286339	2016-02-03T15:08:53	dasan In ~1 year they'll announce &lt;1 hr deliver in SF, NYC, and Seattle for Prime members.
_mades	694900014846472192	2016-02-03T15:07:28	dasan there goal is to bring the product to the user in near real time - in order to do that you have to close distances.
_mades	694899860340895744	2016-02-03T15:06:51	dasan I actually strongly disagree. I look at the stores as mini-distribution centres for popular items in urban areas.
_mades	694895077068513280	2016-02-03T14:47:51	dasan to be fair, they said the same thing to APPL ~15 years ago
_mades	694894751439577088	2016-02-03T14:46:33	dasan but the car has no buttons...

_mades	694407536452046848	2016-02-02T06:30:32	dasan I'm curious about your thoughts on my thoughts about twitter: 
_mades	694381602311278592	2016-02-02T04:47:29	dasan I disagree business runs itself. The ad side does but creating products that keep drawing attention takes a lot of dedication

_mades	689810368366022656	2016-01-20T14:03:02	I'm predicting a Trump landslide victory. His message is: I win, others don't. What's Hillary's? Bernie's? Cruz's? Rubio's? Kaich's?

_mades	687309316320292864	2016-01-13T16:24:45	dasan advertisers only see effectiveness if other developers build tools to make it useable. TWTR Snapchat et al. have poor tools
_mades	687308848999346177	2016-01-13T16:22:53	dasan if you want a leading indicator for an ads product talk to developers about their tools
_mades	687308551358967808	2016-01-13T16:21:42	Judahe dasan not yet - their developer tools aren't as strong yet. A good "ads" product is as strong as it's developer tools

_mades	684111263572602880	2016-01-04T20:36:50	dasan their failure to hit messaging as well as being able to tie services into the core platform is awful product management
_mades	684110609957449728	2016-01-04T20:34:14	dasan it's why I don't tweet nearly as much anymore - it's too stressful long term - I put power user attrition at 3 years
_mades	684110457603489793	2016-01-04T20:33:37	dasan Everything is focused on live on being "in the know" - humans don't want to be in the know all the time
_mades	684109218484498432	2016-01-04T20:28:42	dasan it's because they had success with live events/fastest place for news - used that for acquisition - the product is DESIGNED for churn
_mades	684108680321708036	2016-01-04T20:26:34	dasan They've tried to focus too much on live/events when in reality this is a very small part of peoples lives
_mades	684108394911891457	2016-01-04T20:25:26	dasan The magic is gone and they've/re missing the boat on messaging (a platform they should've owned)
_mades	684108084210450432	2016-01-04T20:24:12	dasan it's a lot of things and a failure to expand the platform TWTR
_mades	684106716166926337	2016-01-04T20:18:45	9) While I do agree with paulg that having rich and poor is good - I feel the system we've created around it needs to be addressed
_mades	684106387006316544	2016-01-04T20:17:27	8) In 1907 JPM (the man) was shipping gold out of his own pocket to prop up the economy. In 2008 JPM the bank took it from tax payers
_mades	684106039059431424	2016-01-04T20:16:04	7) The other argument is that the rich don't feel as connected to society as they have in the past
_mades	684105373834457089	2016-01-04T20:13:25	6) By focusing the income inequality debate on just that he/she is rich misses the societal impacts outside of straight cash
_mades	684105028324438017	2016-01-04T20:12:03	dasan I believe it to be true - my gf was prolific and popular within our space and now she's just tired of having the same conversations
_mades	684104737201991680	2016-01-04T20:10:54	5) You now have a society where it seems like the wealthy are actively stacking the deck against those left
_mades	684104336432041984	2016-01-04T20:09:18	4) Combine this with the lobbying and the fact that you can literally hear politicians advertising specific opinions from billionaires
_mades	684103953798270981	2016-01-04T20:07:47	3) It's the active avoidance to keep money in ways that aren't reasonably available to normal people where the anger comes from
_mades	684103665486008327	2016-01-04T20:06:38	2) Tax loopholes, subsidies, trusts, offshore accounts are not really available to the average person
_mades	684102784367636480	2016-01-04T20:03:08	2) I don't think people necessarily begrudge others being rich or generating wealth but the idea that they don't give enough back
_mades	684102158569082880	2016-01-04T20:00:39	1) I think paulg is looking at economic inequality too much in difference in money brought in versus additional benefits
_mades	684102103288147969	2016-01-04T20:00:26	GaelicTorus and probably cal poly
_mades	684101875218649089	2016-01-04T19:59:31	HighlySalassee not even - economy is becoming so skills based that old gatekeepers/quick checks (university) are irrelevant
_mades	684101648835309568	2016-01-04T19:58:37	New rant on paulg's views on economic inequality!
_mades	684101085905170432	2016-01-04T19:56:23	GaelicTorus is it funny that the only STEM that continue postgrad are S&amp;M? ironic
_mades	684100800034041857	2016-01-04T19:55:15	GaelicTorus also at US Schools don't undergrad outnumber post-grad like 10 or 20-1
_mades	684100565866004480	2016-01-04T19:54:19	GaelicTorus They get paid for research a stipend - in some cases - but a lot of post degrees are super expensive
_mades	684100314581086208	2016-01-04T19:53:19	9) Otherwise stop blaming students for dictating the way they want the ridiculous fees your charging to be spent.
_mades	684100134897082368	2016-01-04T19:52:36	8) So if Alan Dershowitz wants colleges to be a place of free thought they need to be able to tell students to bounce
_mades	684099883456966656	2016-01-04T19:51:36	7) Accept my rules while still giving me 30% every year GMAFB
_mades	684099738434711552	2016-01-04T19:51:02	6) Colleges are now no longer in a financial position where they can tell someone go somewhere else
_mades	684099485576916992	2016-01-04T19:50:01	5) Students will get their paper in manner they want (with plush dorms and language they want to hear)
_mades	684099273596755968	2016-01-04T19:49:11	4) Colleges are now the most expensive paper printer in the world (many thousands for 1 page!)
_mades	684099079392083969	2016-01-04T19:48:25	3) When you're charging $60-$120k you're definitely no longer free - and are now subject to market demands
_mades	684098901830438914	2016-01-04T19:47:42	2) This happened long before the protests of today but when they decided to become businesses
_mades	684098785786642433	2016-01-04T19:47:15	1) Colleges became a "dangerous place for free thought" as soon as they decided to stop being one

_mades	679385261084643328	2015-12-22T19:37:23	FWIW the general advice here is pretty sound: as in you probably shouldn't apply to grad school:
