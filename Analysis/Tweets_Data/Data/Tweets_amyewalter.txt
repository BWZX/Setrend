amyewalter	702567954521710594	2016-02-24T18:57:08	The fact that Gov., Sandoval is pro-choice makes him instantly unacceptable to most of GOP as either SCOTUS or VP.

amyewalter	701166161359151106	2016-02-20T22:06:54	A Clinton win in NV means “firewall” strategy is alive and well. Pressure now on Bernie to prove he can expand his base.
