donnabrazile	701271299130167297	2016-02-21T05:04:41	Donald Trump is heading to Nevada. The only sure bet in Nevada is that the house will eventually come out ahead.
donnabrazile	701270032609730560	2016-02-21T04:59:39	Our impossible expectations of Hillary Clinton and all women in authority 
donnabrazile	701268596236783617	2016-02-21T04:53:56	GOP-CAN ANYONE STOP TRUMP?   It doesn’t look like anyone can stop Donald Trump, and that includes Donald Trump.
donnabrazile	701267689856065538	2016-02-21T04:50:20	Still, in Rubio’s favor is the fact that close does count, both in horseshoes and in punditry.
donnabrazile	701267277564346369	2016-02-21T04:48:42	Polls show Donald Trump is very competitive with evangelical voters.  This means Ted Cruz will have to build a new southern firewall.
donnabrazile	701265825781514240	2016-02-21T04:42:56	Still, Bernie Sanders’ populist message did very well in the Nevadacaucus. There’s a reason that it’s called “populist. FeelTheBern
donnabrazile	701265517416288256	2016-02-21T04:41:42	DEMOCRATS: Hillary wins Nevadacaucus  A win is a win, and win is what she needed. Nobody minds a close call if the call goes your way.
donnabrazile	701264814845210625	2016-02-21T04:38:55	A few more thoughts: Jeb Bush is out. You can replace Jeb's  exclamation point with a period. End of sentence.
donnabrazile	701264398250221568	2016-02-21T04:37:16	Now Rubio will get all that donor money that had gone to Jeb Bush. And we’ve seen how much good that money did for The Bush campaign.
donnabrazile	701263722761728000	2016-02-21T04:34:35	Yet another state Senator Marco Rubio didn’t win, and he still gives a victory speech. Can he do that all the way to the GOP convention?
donnabrazile	701263442850676737	2016-02-21T04:33:28	DonaldTrump’s path forward is clear, which is ironic because nobody can figure out how he got this far in winning two states.
donnabrazile	701262829131726848	2016-02-21T04:31:01	From every conventional viewpoint, Trump did about everything he could possibly do to lose South Carolina, and he still won. That's huge.

donnabrazile	701237115351207936	2016-02-21T02:48:51	MarcoRubio tries to remain above the fray, mostly because he doesn’t do well in frays.
donnabrazile	701236813025796099	2016-02-21T02:47:39	TedCruz is acting as if he won. Now, he's counting on an army of volunteers… a few of whom seem to have impressive skills in Photoshop.
donnabrazile	701236471521349632	2016-02-21T02:46:17	Ohio Governor John Kasich was not a good fit for the SouthCarolinaPrimary -- and I mean that as a compliment. BenCarson is misunderstood.
donnabrazile	701235804530569216	2016-02-21T02:43:38	Look at how tight the SouthCarolinaPrimary race is for second place. It's RubiovsCruz for the silver.

donnabrazile	701234824481144832	2016-02-21T02:39:45	BernieSanders would never have condone this shameful behavior. Folks, we have 2 good candidates in Democratic race.

donnabrazile	701220882396504064	2016-02-21T01:44:21	JebBush will suspend his campaign. Thanks for your service. There's no reason to spend another day running just to come in 3,4 or 5th.

donnabrazile	701204887380500480	2016-02-21T00:40:47	If Governor Jeb Bush is an also-ran in South Carolina, it’s hard to see how he can also run many more places. But, he should stay in.
