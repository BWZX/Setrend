CardiffGarcia	712909936783716352	2016-03-24T07:52:28	DanielaGabor I've got a piece on this coming soon, I promise!
CardiffGarcia	712838177585803265	2016-03-24T03:07:20	Woah -- The Americans needs to master the art of showing "week ahead" clips without being so spoiler-y!
CardiffGarcia	712742359071633412	2016-03-23T20:46:35	Tweeting this BATMAN v SUPERMAN review by mangiotto because it's just great stuff. Criticism as national exorcism. 
CardiffGarcia	712390339806568449	2016-03-22T21:27:47	Excellent CardiffGarcia FTAlphaville analysis. Explains well challenges &amp; complications of Cuba economy &amp;internet 
CardiffGarcia	712790491641749505	2016-03-23T23:57:50	felixsalmon Have you ever seen us both in the same room together?...
CardiffGarcia	712760698288275457	2016-03-23T21:59:27	Here is a quick blog post on how America should go about redistributing respect: 
CardiffGarcia	712680638290247683	2016-03-23T16:41:19	DanielaGabor Great, and of course feel free to point me towards other relevant literature and readings. Always happy to hear arguments!
CardiffGarcia	712680446597992449	2016-03-23T16:40:34	DanielaGabor Massive corruption embedded *already* in the Cuban economy. I've no doubt it won't end overnight.
CardiffGarcia	712679868014718976	2016-03-23T16:38:16	DanielaGabor ... this in the coming weeks.
CardiffGarcia	712679819473981440	2016-03-23T16:38:04	DanielaGabor ...not the best place for that discussion. I set some thoughts down here:  And will write more about...
CardiffGarcia	712679686963331074	2016-03-23T16:37:32	DanielaGabor With respect, that's really not what Ted's doing. I do firmly disagree with you about Cuba's need for reform, but Twitter...
CardiffGarcia	712678092272177154	2016-03-23T16:31:12	DanielaGabor Hi Daniela, I guess I don't quite understand your question? I doubt Ted'd dispute those other countries are disfunctional
CardiffGarcia	712675314204348417	2016-03-23T16:20:10	Ted is one of the best Cuba-watching academics -- recommended: 
CardiffGarcia	712467081825017857	2016-03-23T02:32:43	"I like Donald Trump. I think he’s terrific. I think he’s brash. I think he speaks the truth." -- Ted Cruz, 6/30/15 
CardiffGarcia	712467553809993732	2016-03-23T02:34:36	"Is there virtue in the virtuosic execution of evil deeds?" Fantastic writing abt The Americans  (ht lizzieohreally)

CardiffGarcia	712456464078643200	2016-03-23T01:50:32	Worth noting it's not a Cruz ad, but produced by anti-Trump super PAC. 
CardiffGarcia	712456395111661568	2016-03-23T01:50:16	There is something wrong with this person (and I don’t mean Darcy, or even Cruz). 
CardiffGarcia	712455337417297920	2016-03-23T01:46:03	For the night crew, icymi here was my Tweet storm on the embargo, Cuba-US diplomacy, and Obama's speech: 
CardiffGarcia	712414325735104514	2016-03-22T23:03:05	Esto ocurrió en LaHabana minutos después de marcharse Obama. Opositor interrumpe tiro en vivo y lo encarcelan Cuba 
CardiffGarcia	712395064102817792	2016-03-22T21:46:33	Good, good... 
CardiffGarcia	712376928829714432	2016-03-22T20:34:29	Happy 6 year anniversary to the ACA. Everything you need to know about our progress on coverage, costs &amp; quality: 
CardiffGarcia	712287601517006848	2016-03-22T14:39:32	Wow. Nearly half of US oil production comes from wells that have been drilled since 2014:  
CardiffGarcia	712351160015847424	2016-03-22T18:52:06	Storyfied the Cuba tweet storm in response to tomashirstecon's correct point that I'm the worst for not threading 
CardiffGarcia	712347966376251394	2016-03-22T18:39:24	tomashirstecon Oh right, totally forgot about that. Doh!
CardiffGarcia	712347684540002304	2016-03-22T18:38:17	That's it, I'm done. More in my post from yesterday if you're curious: 
CardiffGarcia	712347472610234370	2016-03-22T18:37:26	Entrepreneurs are rising in number and have good ideas but too many have dubious legal status and lack access to financing
CardiffGarcia	712347368813764608	2016-03-22T18:37:02	After which the only decently paying sectors are in low-productivity the tourism industry (among the private-sector occupations allowed)
CardiffGarcia	712347191382179841	2016-03-22T18:36:19	Young people have only limited choice of majors in college (5 years to graduate) and mandated low-paid 3 years of work for the state after
CardiffGarcia	712347125221236736	2016-03-22T18:36:04	Cuba has horribly weak fertility rates for a developing country, and the gov already struggles to pay for free services (healthcare, etc)
CardiffGarcia	712347020057452544	2016-03-22T18:35:39	And no, it isn’t just because of the “wet foot, dry foot” policy that grants Cubans near-automatic residency in the US
CardiffGarcia	712346947479187456	2016-03-22T18:35:21	Finally, Obama was shrewd to emphasize young people in his speech. They’ve been leaving, and Cuba has a terrible demographics problem
CardiffGarcia	712346871969091584	2016-03-22T18:35:03	And yes, this includes many dissidents -- like the amazing Miriam Leiva, a co-founder of the Ladies in White: 
CardiffGarcia	712346737705230336	2016-03-22T18:34:31	But if that doesn’t sway you, the results of this excellent (secretively conducted) poll should: 
CardiffGarcia	712346669497487360	2016-03-22T18:34:15	The closest one got was requesting that Obama trade it for Castro allowing Internet access everywhere (it is still forbidden in the homes)
CardiffGarcia	712346538421321728	2016-03-22T18:33:44	And Cubans overwhelmingly favour ending it--I asked literally hundreds of regular Cubans during my sabbatical there; not a single supporter
CardiffGarcia	712346373350293504	2016-03-22T18:33:04	Cubans aren’t rubes. They understand that things work differently elsewhere. I thought Obama’s speech was nicely calibrated in this regard.
CardiffGarcia	712346286775619584	2016-03-22T18:32:44	More fundamentally, the opinions of actual Cubans are commonly ignored in US debates about this -- by both right and left btw
CardiffGarcia	712346231121399808	2016-03-22T18:32:30	(Although I don’t agree with *philosophical* arguments, I was once a young Cuban-American hardliner myself and have sympathy for them.)
CardiffGarcia	712346174494146561	2016-03-22T18:32:17	So arguments that the embargo can work *as a tactic* to bring about change in Cuba are baffling
CardiffGarcia	712346146211901440	2016-03-22T18:32:10	Nor does it lead to fewer political prisoners. Look up the Black Spring of 2003
CardiffGarcia	712345457112911872	2016-03-22T18:29:26	(And the numbers don’t properly convey the psychic devastation that lingers with Cubans who lived through it.)
CardiffGarcia	712345369519128576	2016-03-22T18:29:05	None of the recent Western econo-calamities compares with it. Don’t believe me?… 
CardiffGarcia	712345202099298305	2016-03-22T18:28:25	If such a policy could have worked, it would have worked during the Periodo Especial of the 90s after Soviet subsidies ended.
CardiffGarcia	712345083949883392	2016-03-22T18:27:57	Arguments for the embargo *as a tactic* to economically squeeze Cuba into changing are baffling to me
CardiffGarcia	712344993256513536	2016-03-22T18:27:35	Ibid: 
CardiffGarcia	712344951053357056	2016-03-22T18:27:25	Rise of the private sector has been limited but real, and tourism helps it directly. From : 
CardiffGarcia	712344845063335936	2016-03-22T18:27:00	I too get annoyed by soft portrayals of life in Cuba or its government, but it's untrue that Cuba hasn't improved in the Raul/Obama era
CardiffGarcia	712344562962812928	2016-03-22T18:25:53	Gonna do a tweetstorm type thing on Cuba and Obama's speech, about 15-20 tweets. Mute now if not your bag
CardiffGarcia	712318245517197314	2016-03-22T16:41:18	s_m_i tomgara "Above 35 and thus proceed with caution if at all" vs "YES let's exploit the f&amp;^% out their eagerness"

CardiffGarcia	712292185845145600	2016-03-22T14:57:45	Good speech. Re the lingering suspicions Obama was addressing, here's my post from yesterday icymi:

CardiffGarcia	712023021700182017	2016-03-21T21:08:11	Inability to make listings available to non-Americans had been a big source of annoyance in the places I stayed: 
CardiffGarcia	712019683755597826	2016-03-21T20:54:55	Just dropped a US-Cuba post bomb: 
CardiffGarcia	711989915869978632	2016-03-21T18:56:38	Obama is taking away an ideological bludgeon from a limping LatAm left. And it costs us nothing. 
CardiffGarcia	711933103778996224	2016-03-21T15:10:53	And here is ElYuma's excellent fact sheet on Cuba's limited but emerging private-sector workforce:

CardiffGarcia	711667049072877569	2016-03-20T21:33:41	Well said. It's painful watching images of friends of mine like GorkiAguila being shoved into police trucks 
CardiffGarcia	711685647136854016	2016-03-20T22:47:35	BTabrum BDStanley Good point, but don't overestimate Cuban supply-chain responsiveness
CardiffGarcia	711683897449451520	2016-03-20T22:40:38	I'd give it another six months. That should clear out most of the Che T-shirts
