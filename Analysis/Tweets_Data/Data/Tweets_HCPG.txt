HCPG	702322045242093568	2016-02-24T02:39:58	To be clear, don't mean if 190 goes you get 176 -- it just means that those are the clearest trading pivots we have in front of us.  SPY
HCPG	702321441375539201	2016-02-24T02:37:34	Of course lots of space between a short-term hold on 190 SPY which is 1% away, and 176 but those are the clearest edges we have
HCPG	702321177314746368	2016-02-24T02:36:31	2) If 190 goes then next support which will act as magnet that has our eye is 50sma monthly/blue line SPY 
HCPG	702321014298976256	2016-02-24T02:35:52	1) Been a while since we posted our monthly chart map -- if SPY closes under 190 gap fill/20sma no bueno zone then bears regain momentum.

HCPG	693831382720643072	2016-01-31T16:21:07	Trading accts -- that's of course a whole different ball game.  Short, long, cash -- all three often every day.
HCPG	693831336667131905	2016-01-31T16:20:56	Retirement accts we cost average into ETFs every month. If we feel very strongly about something we will change allocation but  that's it.

HCPG	693160550306426880	2016-01-29T19:55:28	Commented on StockTwits: it's our most reliable trend pattern. So if we're dying to go contra-trend, and we see ... 
HCPG	693159906971504640	2016-01-29T19:52:54	That rule works exactly on the inverse re support.  Saved us many a time from not getting stubborn.
HCPG	693159665765453825	2016-01-29T19:51:57	One of our best trading rules:  Fire at will shorting at resistance UNLESS Indy.  If Indy, then go with trend or stay in cash.

HCPG	693130942186024960	2016-01-29T17:57:49	If you hear us talking about our Indy pattern-- ascending 20EMA (blue line) on 191.50 break is textbook.  SPY

HCPG	693109277108494336	2016-01-29T16:31:43	We're short SPY 191.5 and stop around there now --  if we get stopped, likely try again on R2/192

HCPG	692489680588279809	2016-01-27T23:29:40	Here's monthly SPX with 20sma. As you can see, actually pretty accurate. Arrows= valid;  yellow=head fake 
HCPG	692488480476286976	2016-01-27T23:24:54	sssvenky too kind, thank you

HCPG	692488096106057729	2016-01-27T23:23:22	If we were running a fund, that would be tough to have such discrepancy on time-frames views.  But thankfully we're just simple traders...
HCPG	692487701304643588	2016-01-27T23:21:48	To sum it up: Short term think we can get a pop, like crude XLF action.  Longer term think we see 170-175 SPY sometime in 2016.
HCPG	692487337398374400	2016-01-27T23:20:21	sssvenky yup. But thankfully nothing goes down straight!

HCPG	692486929418420225	2016-01-27T23:18:44	Commented on StockTwits: well 10% would take it right to the 170 spot, so v much could see that. 
HCPG	692486792545726465	2016-01-27T23:18:11	Commented on StockTwits: think we will see 170-175 at some point this year.

HCPG	692426494983835648	2016-01-27T19:18:35	If we could name one thing right now that has the most psychological impact on this tape -- it's crude 30 level.
HCPG	692426309222342658	2016-01-27T19:17:51	If CL_F can hold above 30, and SPY stay in that highlighted zone, we like the upside potential

HCPG	686637364676972545	2016-01-11T19:54:39	Very much so.  That 9EMA/60min on QQQ at 104 also a wall right now-- reversed right in front of it.  
HCPG	686635570877968384	2016-01-11T19:47:31	And the stop for the basket?  190 max even though would start lightening on 191 failure SPY 
HCPG	686634861998678016	2016-01-11T19:44:42	SPY same thing, again, IF it can close over 192 (9EMA/60min) we will swing long first time in 2016

HCPG	686633302690643968	2016-01-11T19:38:31	Lower monthly BB on SPY -- every time we've hit it 2002, 2008, 2016, market has bounced, and then much lower.

HCPG	686629499459387392	2016-01-11T19:23:24	And... SPY hit the lower monthly BB on the break of 190, first time since 2008.  Hopefully good for a short-term bounce at least.
HCPG	686626392134422528	2016-01-11T19:11:03	QQQ 9EMa/60min is 104, SPY's is 192.   Close above both would be constructive for short-term bottom.
HCPG	686613387011178496	2016-01-11T18:19:22	If we're going to bounce would much rather get a test of overnight lows near SPY 190 and hold

HCPG	686611216706306048	2016-01-11T18:10:45	TraderMD possible. But very small data set so hard to say anything definitive.  ES_F bounced overnight right at the lower BB. interesting.

HCPG	685622619245170688	2016-01-09T00:42:25	Completely different tape for us personally, sentiment wise, than it has been for a long time.
HCPG	685622440240652288	2016-01-09T00:41:42	But short for us is very rare when market is this oversold - we rarely short under BB and today has no problem doing so (against 20ema/5min)
HCPG	685622150011617280	2016-01-09T00:40:33	We were both short and long today -- long is normal for us with market so oversold trying to catch panic reversals.

HCPG	685206715323695104	2016-01-07T21:09:46	Look at this nice orderly trend down SPY on 15 min -- that was the trade instead of trying to buy 194 reversal 
HCPG	685206223260487680	2016-01-07T21:07:48	And in the end, it was just a simple trend day down from 11 AM on...
HCPG	685206182110220288	2016-01-07T21:07:38	Giving self C - for today's trading and only reason passing is because made money.  Had too much of a bias today looking for reversal.

HCPG	685176230409142272	2016-01-07T19:08:37	Higher low here would be really convenient.

HCPG	685173976465723393	2016-01-07T18:59:40	9EMA is often first resistance on these type of trades, and hence first target Through there and maybe get 195 SPY 
HCPG	685173431248093184	2016-01-07T18:57:30	SPY goes to 195 and I'll leave the turret to make some latte. At 9EMA/5min now , first v short-term target.

HCPG	685077172793430016	2016-01-07T12:35:00	Only rule for days like this for us is:  If it's orderly, go in same direction. If it turns panicky, look for reversal candles to jump on.
