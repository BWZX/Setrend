TomChivers	725320187482902528	2016-04-27T13:46:23	Bunny_Snuggler simply not true, as far as I can tell, but a nice easy story to galvanise the troops with.

TomChivers	725300625798500352	2016-04-27T12:28:39	CasparSalmon calls to arms still need to be factually accurate. Unless you're OK with "the other side" also misrepresenting for own ends

TomChivers	725285168987131904	2016-04-27T11:27:14	richardpolhill I think it was within a week or maybe 30 days, but Hunt was basing that on an unpublished study as far as I could tell

TomChivers	725279471461392384	2016-04-27T11:04:35	Now THIS, via jameskirkup and by the BMJ's Richard Smith, is a good piece on the strike. Much better than Boyle's: 
TomChivers	725277753205989377	2016-04-27T10:57:46	richardpolhill come now. Mortality rates apply in a given time, as you well know.
TomChivers	725277595005280257	2016-04-27T10:57:08	MikePettit89 having written on this myself, I can confidently say Boyle's piece really is not much more informed than a Littlejohn special
TomChivers	725269098310062080	2016-04-27T10:23:22	dannydamanny85 haha my laptop is plugged into the mains I can go on FOREVER (nice talking to you)
TomChivers	725268974393511936	2016-04-27T10:22:52	dannydamanny85 but that's obviously already happened. 75 times in last six months I think. I don't know what the right compromise is.
TomChivers	725268145594863617	2016-04-27T10:19:35	mrleeward huh, good question. I can't remember and it looks wrong now.

TomChivers	725266821205598208	2016-04-27T10:14:19	dannydamanny85 but saying "it's too complex so I'll say it's simpler than it is so I can feel like I understand it" doesn't help anyone.
TomChivers	725266717719547904	2016-04-27T10:13:54	dannydamanny85 no. You don't. You have to admit the world is complex. You try to understand it, and maybe you fail because it's TOO complex
TomChivers	725265183032107008	2016-04-27T10:07:49	mr_big_peter Peter_Manhattan or more accurately: they can be emotive, satirical, whatever. But they need to also be true and fair.
TomChivers	725265077943844864	2016-04-27T10:07:24	mr_big_peter Peter_Manhattan here's a piece by someone else which says what I think about that. In short: bullshit 
TomChivers	725264521384841216	2016-04-27T10:05:11	dannydamanny85 I am ABSOLUTELY NOT a fan of Hunt. See  I'm a fan of people saying things that are true.
TomChivers	725264284654129154	2016-04-27T10:04:14	andrewmacdowall mamossman found it! 
TomChivers	725260247418474496	2016-04-27T09:48:12	mr_big_peter Peter_Manhattan I certainly don't think the BMA and doctors are powerless or weak. But even if they were, truth is important
TomChivers	725260023484551168	2016-04-27T09:47:18	mr_big_peter Peter_Manhattan absolutely 100% disagree. Point out true things. Don't make stuff up. (In general, I'm not on anyone's side.)
TomChivers	725259365700276224	2016-04-27T09:44:42	mr_big_peter Peter_Manhattan "it's OK when I do it because"
TomChivers	725259045460910080	2016-04-27T09:43:25	richardpolhill I think consultants and registrars are different, but yes, overall staffing, not just jun drs, seems to be the problem.
TomChivers	725250796607148032	2016-04-27T09:10:39	Zac Goldsmith doesn't get asked for his favourite biscuit on his Mumsnet chat. Answers anyway, gets told. 
TomChivers	725257899841200128	2016-04-27T09:38:52	MikePettit89 I'm sure you have the same attitude to Richard Littlejohn's columns, yes?
TomChivers	725257783151628288	2016-04-27T09:38:24	Ankaman616 I was expecting a column on politics to not be total untrue bollocks, whoever it's written by.
TomChivers	725257592688283649	2016-04-27T09:37:39	dannydamanny85 repeating comforting lies to make the author &amp; reader feel good without doing difficult work of understanding complex topic.
TomChivers	725257417538322432	2016-04-27T09:36:57	dannydamanny85 false on weekend deaths; false, yes, on Hunt wanting to dismantle the NHS. False that he wrote a book about how to do it.
TomChivers	725256350004068352	2016-04-27T09:32:43	Peter_Manhattan he's taken Richard Littlejohn's shtick and used it in a cause you agree with. If you're comfortable with that, fine.
TomChivers	725255051397193728	2016-04-27T09:27:33	dannydamanny85 getting a false message out is worse than not getting the message out.
TomChivers	725254985408241668	2016-04-27T09:27:17	Peter_Manhattan is that really the worst example you could find on my Twitter feed? I literally SAY it's a joke IN THAT TWEET.
TomChivers	725254546071638018	2016-04-27T09:25:33	abonnyman23 I think he does. Or he doesn't care if you do or don't.
TomChivers	725254293591314432	2016-04-27T09:24:32	GOsborneGenius JonnElledge I know.
TomChivers	725254148682297348	2016-04-27T09:23:58	GOsborneGenius JonnElledge it's complex. I wrote about it  &amp; it's hard to sum up. Admit complexity or don't cover
TomChivers	725253860349063168	2016-04-27T09:22:49	GOsborneGenius JonnElledge then don't satirise it. If it's too complicated to do well in satire, don't satirise it. There's no obligation.
TomChivers	725252524593319936	2016-04-27T09:17:31	The Echo's campaigning on Hillsborough has been a real credit to the city. The sort of paper you want locally. 
TomChivers	725252246670299136	2016-04-27T09:16:24	mr_big_peter easy to make any situation seem absurd if you're allowed to make stuff up. That's what Richard Littlejohn's done for years.
TomChivers	725252072241790976	2016-04-27T09:15:43	psybertron I know, I get that. I just think a politically themed column in a paper has rules as well, and comedians don't get a free pass.
TomChivers	725250796934279168	2016-04-27T09:10:39	psybertron (which would be exactly as true, by the way, so you can't have your cake and eat it by saying that it would be unfair or untrue)
TomChivers	725250698183630848	2016-04-27T09:10:15	psybertron and if a Tory-leaning comedian wrote something with "licence" saying junior doctors were killing people by not working Sundays?
TomChivers	725250360227577856	2016-04-27T09:08:55	richardjgodwin yes. the last par was lovely.
TomChivers	725250156854165504	2016-04-27T09:08:06	GOsborneGenius JonnElledge I don't care. Comparison is irrelevant. Hunt's (undoubted) misdeeds are Hunt's, they don't excuse Boyle's.
TomChivers	725249576622501888	2016-04-27T09:05:48	psybertron responsibility to "represent all the complexities", maybe not. Responsibility to say things that are essentially true, yes.
TomChivers	725249083493986304	2016-04-27T09:03:50	AmandaKendal "myth" is overstating the case, but it's complicated – see this I did on the topic 
TomChivers	725248958239510528	2016-04-27T09:03:20	GOsborneGenius JonnElledge he's still misrepresenting stuff for a political point. "But Dad, he started it" is not a good defence
TomChivers	725248667662319616	2016-04-27T09:02:11	NaomiAllthenews so it seems *backs away, maintaining eye contact*
TomChivers	725248342519889920	2016-04-27T09:00:53	TomChivers mathildeny The DWP did a study in 2009 which found name-based discrimination in the UK: 
TomChivers	725248440368783360	2016-04-27T09:01:17	AakashMehendale yes but it wasn't clever and I don't care if it was funny if it isn't TRUE. I hate jokes that aren't TRUE. it's a problem
TomChivers	725248200660144128	2016-04-27T09:00:20	ianralph …there does seem to be some connection with staffing levels, although it's complicated: see 
TomChivers	725248043893821440	2016-04-27T08:59:42	ianralph yes  well OK no, but more people DON'T die at the weekend (they're more likely to die if they're ADMITTED at the weekend), and…
TomChivers	725247774867001345	2016-04-27T08:58:38	IanDouglas JonnElledge have you been going through my facebook
TomChivers	725247656696659968	2016-04-27T08:58:10	NaomiAllthenews I used to work for HotCourses. It was the worst job I ever had. I have more reason to hate Hunt than most.
TomChivers	725247487959769088	2016-04-27T08:57:30	JonnElledge I reckon that's a low estimate. But my joylessness could still be eternal even if it was only sporadically active
TomChivers	725247201061027841	2016-04-27T08:56:21	TorquilMacneil yeah, basically.
TomChivers	725247059553570817	2016-04-27T08:55:48	JonnElledge true. Joyless Tom briefly powering down, waiting for his next victim to swim by, unsuspecting
TomChivers	725246762055770112	2016-04-27T08:54:37	phowax yes it was.
TomChivers	725246695332810752	2016-04-27T08:54:21	And we shouldn't celebrate it just coz it misrepresents the facts in a way that "our side" finds politically useful. Anyway. Joyless Tom out
TomChivers	725246447843696640	2016-04-27T08:53:22	For instance this line is just wrong. I know it's a joke but it misrepresents the facts just as badly as Hunt has 
TomChivers	725246306801860608	2016-04-27T08:52:48	mathildeny true, it may be different. although I fondly imagine Britain to have less of a race problem than the US. I'm probably wrong.
TomChivers	725245772074237952	2016-04-27T08:50:41	I know I'm utterly joyless, but I just don't think Frankie Boyle's piece is very good or helpful. Simplistic jokes about a complex topic.
TomChivers	725244553725394944	2016-04-27T08:45:50	ki_sekiya that said, similar study in 2004 did find that people w/ African-American names were less likely to get interviews. So not clear.
TomChivers	725244381775671296	2016-04-27T08:45:09	ki_sekiya yes but single case studies doesn't say much; I'm sure you could find a white guy who says the same thing. Can only tell w/ data.
TomChivers	725241938279075841	2016-04-27T08:35:27	interesting: study finds race and gender don't seem to affect how likely an applicant is to get a job interview

TomChivers	724978894995111936	2016-04-26T15:10:12	JonathanArnott kieranpjobrien …to concentrate energies on working out whether that impact will be positive or negative, at least imho.
TomChivers	724978775998488577	2016-04-26T15:09:44	JonathanArnott kieranpjobrien if GDP growth is affected by 0.1% either way it'll outweigh impact of contribution in a few years so better…
TomChivers	724978578832678913	2016-04-26T15:08:57	JonathanArnott kieranpjobrien true, but it's a bit drunk-looks-for-keys-under-lamp. ("You lost them there?" "No, it's where the light is.)

TomChivers	724976503373631489	2016-04-26T15:00:42	kieranpjobrien JonathanArnott you're right, the focus on our contribution is a bit childish and unhelpful, tbh
TomChivers	724976423077863425	2016-04-26T15:00:23	kieranpjobrien JonathanArnott nope. Even a tiny impact on GDP growth (+ve or -ve) would dwarf it. And non-financial considerations too
TomChivers	724975862194536448	2016-04-26T14:58:09	kieranpjobrien JonathanArnott yup. Although I suppose they could argue that we could spend that as we chose, without EU earmarking.

TomChivers	724975469129555970	2016-04-26T14:56:35	JonathanArnott kieranpjobrien (also, we don't give £19bn, we get the rebate, so it's £13bn, as I'm sure you know.)
TomChivers	724975325944373248	2016-04-26T14:56:01	JonathanArnott kieranpjobrien that's true. But it would be less than a 1% rise in the NHS budget so I'm sceptical it'd have much effect.

TomChivers	720545792520515585	2016-04-14T09:34:38	katebevan flimsin it's interesting but ultimately disappointing I think
TomChivers	720545421832151040	2016-04-14T09:33:10	flimsin (that piece is long, but I found it quite revealing, so if you've got a little while read it if you can.)
TomChivers	720544990963884032	2016-04-14T09:31:27	flimsin that may be the case in some instances, idk, but I doubt it's most. I think a lot feel like this 
TomChivers	720543778646421505	2016-04-14T09:26:38	flimsin or some of them are, anyway. Some of them are Roosh V. But I approve of this guy making an attempt to understand them as humans.
TomChivers	720543671444246529	2016-04-14T09:26:12	flimsin you see the point he's groping towards, though? These are men (or boys, really) who are desperate for female attention and approval
TomChivers	720542881388367872	2016-04-14T09:23:04	flimsin shouldn't criticise people for honest confessions of mistakes, I don't think, or we discourage them from owning up to others. idk.
TomChivers	720542716212473860	2016-04-14T09:22:25	flimsin well, exactly. he's saying he stayed friends with someone he knows he shouldn't have. It's a confession of wrongdoing on his part
TomChivers	720541416846409728	2016-04-14T09:17:15	flimsin I don't think that's what he means, exactly. He's asking if that's representative of a) men b) men online c) men in these forums

TomChivers	720204676935905280	2016-04-13T10:59:10	rtrnicholl AntBreach but we're drifting away from original point which was: "sex worker" is a 30yo term and, to me, pretty uncontroversial
TomChivers	720204477203132416	2016-04-13T10:58:22	rtrnicholl AntBreach which at least suggests they're not being forced. (The other two polls were in Canada and Australia.)
TomChivers	720204365177466880	2016-04-13T10:57:56	rtrnicholl AntBreach I don't. Just looked at some polls, though, and the 3 I saw (eg ) say most enjoy their jobs

TomChivers	720197238484570112	2016-04-13T10:29:36	rtrnicholl timothy_stanley reporterboy a fair bit but far from exclusively:  
TomChivers	720197034129625088	2016-04-13T10:28:48	rtrnicholl timothy_stanley reporterboy also, unclear how "industry" inherently less judgmental than "trade" anyway
TomChivers	720196822174670848	2016-04-13T10:27:57	timothy_stanley reporterboy how about "profession" (as in "the oldest…")? (FWIW I think moral outrage blunts critical thinking but ymmv)
TomChivers	720196549708496896	2016-04-13T10:26:52	rtrnicholl timothy_stanley reporterboy "drug industry" seems pretty common:

TomChivers	720194638938824704	2016-04-13T10:19:17	timothy_stanley what? Really? Been around at least 30 years:  
TomChivers	720194151707459584	2016-04-13T10:17:20	pkolding yes exactly. You can say govts are too risk-averse or puritan but can't easily base that claim on scientific evidence
TomChivers	720191552379858944	2016-04-13T10:07:01	pkolding risk of everything is dependent on everything else. All you can do is take the average. Yr view is legitimate but not gospel truth
TomChivers	720190965579923456	2016-04-13T10:04:41	pkolding (and then up to individuals on whether they follow guidelines. V little evidence they do, for the record )
TomChivers	720190788886466560	2016-04-13T10:03:59	pkolding …think enjoyment payoff is worth it. But risk is the same. Is 1% chance of alcohol-related death an OK risk? 2%? Up to legislators
TomChivers	720190575169945600	2016-04-13T10:03:08	pkolding that's not something you can answer with data. I wouldn't go cave-diving because it's too risky for me. Others see that risk and…
TomChivers	720190289021923328	2016-04-13T10:02:00	pkolding but since there is a risk, the standards are perfectly justified, depending on how conservative a position you take towards it.

TomChivers	720185087627829248	2016-04-13T09:41:19	pkolding DPJHodges not really; it's a fuzzy line. small wine/day pretty clearly OK. 5/day, pretty clearly harmful. Risk rises in between.
TomChivers	720183297184292864	2016-04-13T09:34:13	pkolding DPJHodges well, that's not true. Clear that excessive drinking is harmful. The exact level it starts being harmful is less clear.
TomChivers	720173860419715072	2016-04-13T08:56:43	pkolding DPJHodges they're not. They're also based on policy goals, which is entirely fair enough. But it is hard to get good data.

TomChivers	718465124403650566	2016-04-08T15:46:48	oliverburkeman trewloy I think in tax affairs, that's probably a good line. Different if he was sleeping with Osborne's wife or something

TomChivers	718464268778225664	2016-04-08T15:43:24	oliverburkeman trewloy agree to an extent. But he paid full tax on profits, all legal and above board (I think)? Feel like it's something…
TomChivers	718463529536331776	2016-04-08T15:40:28	rjsh11 trewloy true. Although *everything* benefits people who can afford better stuff. It's a question of degree how much of that is OK.

TomChivers	718459296833531904	2016-04-08T15:23:39	josephgrist yes indeed
TomChivers	718459239845470209	2016-04-08T15:23:25	LallyNott no but surely taking money away from the disabled is bad all on its own, and his legal tax arrangements are irrelevant to it?

TomChivers	718458983418343427	2016-04-08T15:22:24	Reivers2014 yeah which was catastrophically bad media management and is really hurting him in the polls.
TomChivers	718458789180129280	2016-04-08T15:21:38	LallyNott maybe. just feel like there's a lot of hysteria &amp; I don't fully understand why. I pay into an ISA &amp; pension fund to reduce my tax
TomChivers	718458054505861120	2016-04-08T15:18:43	macnelliebus your pension fund, if you have one, is probably partly in something like that. Certainly all MPs' pensions are partly offshore
TomChivers	718457805829718018	2016-04-08T15:17:43	macnelliebus but we all have access to those vehicles. can do it with $5,000  so it's not just for the super-wealthy
TomChivers	718456732515753984	2016-04-08T15:13:27	macnelliebus to reduce taxes paid, I guess. I mean that's why I've got an ISA. I have yet to fully understand the moral difference I guess

TomChivers	718455940387876864	2016-04-08T15:10:19	rdgresident see that comes under "terrible media management" rather than anything morally dubious to me, but ymmv etc

TomChivers	718455488732651520	2016-04-08T15:08:31	macnelliebus but he paid all the taxes due on his profits, right?
TomChivers	718454784181870593	2016-04-08T15:05:43	TomChivers no. He invested in a very common product, paid all taxes due on profit from that product. Nothing illegal.
TomChivers	718455054978691072	2016-04-08T15:06:48	Reivers2014 well no, she was pushed out because her party thought she was losing them votes, which doesn't apply here
TomChivers	718454866432102400	2016-04-08T15:06:03	RichardDowell9 not saying it's "fine" (tho I gather he paid full UK tax on the profits? That true?) I'm saying it's not a resigning matter

TomChivers	718453889159274497	2016-04-08T15:02:10	TomChivers You say that, but historic evidence proves that each time the resigncameron hashtag has been used, he has ended up resigning.
TomChivers	718454307717255168	2016-04-08T15:03:49	mikeysmith only person I've seen saying that is John Mann
TomChivers	718454214293397504	2016-04-08T15:03:27	mikeysmith hypocrisy I get, though if that were a resigning matter we'd have no politicians left. Any lawyers saying breach of rules?

TomChivers	718453678781370368	2016-04-08T15:01:19	because otherwise, you know, resigncameron seems a little, I dunno, silly?

TomChivers	718376955096276992	2016-04-08T09:56:27	owenblacker agree wholeheartedly, but think the answer to that for Labour MPs is not "tweet false thing", but instead "don't tweet at all"

TomChivers	718375538491002883	2016-04-08T09:50:49	owenblacker but yes, there clearly are grey areas, like I say. But distinction between evasion (illegal) and avoidance (legal) is important

TomChivers	718374380267573248	2016-04-08T09:46:13	owenblacker obviously there are grey areas but making use of legal tax reduction methods is both widespread and fine

TomChivers	718043056847654912	2016-04-07T11:49:40	StewartNial maybe. But (if it's real) I do'nt think it's that doctors are turning people away, it's that people are less likely to come in.

TomChivers	716882018987073537	2016-04-04T06:56:07	sarahchurchwell but the verb "to grow" has a transitive sense. I grow herbs (transitive). Those herbs grow (intransitive).

TomChivers	715830837309218816	2016-04-01T09:19:05	matthewcobb yes, obviously, though not by much. see underweight-by-country slidey-thing graph in my piece. No country got MORE underweight.
TomChivers	715830393874808833	2016-04-01T09:17:20	OnceByton babies don't die of obesity; they do of malnutrition. And people are living longer generally. Obesity is the lesser of two evils.
TomChivers	715830137359638532	2016-04-01T09:16:18	MattKrahe no, % of underweight people has dropped worldwide. (Absolute number still about same, as total # of humans has gone up.)
TomChivers	715829920920965120	2016-04-01T09:15:27	matthewcobb true, though that's still good (your odds of being a malnourished human have dropped; you don't care how many humans there are)

TomChivers	715829113928421376	2016-04-01T09:12:14	alexmassie we're psychologically inclined to see things as either Good or Bad, and trade-offs and mixed pictures are v hard to grasp.
TomChivers	715829000648699904	2016-04-01T09:11:47	alexmassie no one can. It's the halo effect. If you think (eg) nuclear power has benefits, you won't admit it has risks, and vice versa

TomChivers	715828522678411264	2016-04-01T09:09:53	alexmassie it would be so much more *interesting*. Rather than "You say it'll be great! But won't it it be terrible?" "No!" "Yes!" "No!"
TomChivers	715828276552404993	2016-04-01T09:08:55	OnceByton you think people having too much to eat is as bad as people starving? I disagree, in short.

TomChivers	715826791236108288	2016-04-01T09:03:01	diobir007 definitely rather people were too fat than malnourished.
TomChivers	715826154469474304	2016-04-01T09:00:29	Oh, look at you, people tweeting news stories about the Tories and going "the real April Fools!!1!", you've really told them, haven't you.

TomChivers	714833047116496896	2016-03-29T15:14:14	MatSilk exactly
TomChivers	714833002472325120	2016-03-29T15:14:03	TimBrock_DtD yes legally it must be now that I have said it without suitable disclaimers in my twitter bio

TomChivers	714832279986638853	2016-03-29T15:11:11	clarebee1 interesting. isn't that what "liking" is for?
TomChivers	714831161797779456	2016-03-29T15:06:44	Hifistud exactly! The link-tweet is a different beast to the classic RT. A classic RT is usually an endorsement
TomChivers	714830959821062144	2016-03-29T15:05:56	ian_mclaughlin you see, if you'd agreed, you'd have RTed, not linked. Thus providing evidence for my point

TomChivers	714830557591564288	2016-03-29T15:04:20	Let's be honest. RTs usually are endorsements, aren't they?

TomChivers	714812099290120192	2016-03-29T13:50:59	T180985 oh yes true
TomChivers	714811858696478720	2016-03-29T13:50:02	joshspero alexhern yes sorry about that, you now must dedicate your life to bringing it about or face an eternity of psychic torture
TomChivers	714811659492204545	2016-03-29T13:49:14	dave_chivers it's illegal but it's unenforced, so a little swear-box-type in-car app thing would prob reduce honking more than the law does
TomChivers	714811120830300161	2016-03-29T13:47:06	SciencePunk (that Wait But Why piece addresses all that stuff in quite a lot of detail. About changing definitions of death, for eg.)
TomChivers	714810997681295360	2016-03-29T13:46:37	SciencePunk …saying they're just certainly wrong *by definition* is missing the whole point. Medical science will (presumably) improve.
TomChivers	714810872103886848	2016-03-29T13:46:07	SciencePunk but that's all stuff they've addressed! I mean it's right at the heart of what they're talking about. You can *disagree*, but…
TomChivers	714810629568258048	2016-03-29T13:45:09	alexhern (but seriously, it's all about the X in P=X, and I guess I put it at "longish shot but nowhere near Roko's Basilisk madness")
TomChivers	714810356896497665	2016-03-29T13:44:04	alexhern you could have gone with "good books and fine wine" alex and I think we've both learned a lot about you in the last few seconds
TomChivers	714810172208709632	2016-03-29T13:43:20	robmanuel yes they are especially good aren't they
TomChivers	714810085558591490	2016-03-29T13:42:59	SciencePunk how do you know? I distrust your certainty.
TomChivers	714809919661350912	2016-03-29T13:42:20	robmanuel that's too much but I take your point. 1p a go would cripple me at my current expenditure
TomChivers	714809722608742400	2016-03-29T13:41:33	questingvole alexhern no I meant are you buying my pretending to know anything about Don Delillo. I think that post is interesting though
TomChivers	714809631621705729	2016-03-29T13:41:11	(with price increases after 7pm so you stop WAKING MY BLOODY KIDS UP, you inconsiderate bellends)
TomChivers	714809318089076736	2016-03-29T13:39:56	Yes. Also, revving your motorbike. You should be allowed to do it but you should pay for the negative externalities. 
TomChivers	714808937502126080	2016-03-29T13:38:25	SciencePunk (I don't know what that answer is, of course. But you could work it out, in principle.)
TomChivers	714808753732890625	2016-03-29T13:37:42	SciencePunk …the likely years gained if it works &amp; a QALY-type assessment of value of years of later life. There would be a rational answer
TomChivers	714808330095616000	2016-03-29T13:36:01	SciencePunk then there would be a correct Bayesian answer for the right time, depending on my assessment of the probability of it working…
TomChivers	714807940759363585	2016-03-29T13:34:28	SciencePunk no, but no one had sequenced a human genome 20 years ago. Someone vitrified + successfully revived a rabbit kidney apparently.
TomChivers	714807644930834432	2016-03-29T13:33:17	questingvole alexhern haha yes that is the sort of thing that happens in delillo novels, as I know from reading them  are you buying this
TomChivers	714806970394537984	2016-03-29T13:30:36	alexhern tho I agree a problem. Whole brain emulation maybe best shot? dunno. But not P=0. Question of whether it's a good bet is what P is
TomChivers	714806609655017473	2016-03-29T13:29:10	alexhern it's totally different from that! It's not randomly creating a new person, unasked. It's reviving someone who wants to be revived.
TomChivers	714806327432839168	2016-03-29T13:28:03	SciencePunk it comes down to the "1/1bn" estimate. It's a bad bet at those odds. Many would put the estimate much higher.
TomChivers	714803014494715904	2016-03-29T13:14:53	SciencePunk circulatory arrest stuff? V interesting. And does strengthen my belief that cryonics is at least in the "not mad" bracket

TomChivers	714793966252728320	2016-03-29T12:38:56	anabelish waitbutwhy why? That seems to be an argument against all medicine. (Note: they're not "dead" already; that's part of the point.)
TomChivers	714792605964492801	2016-03-29T12:33:32	chazhutton yes actually when you put it like that
TomChivers	714791619833241601	2016-03-29T12:29:37	chazhutton if there was a realistic way of *reviving* those mummies, do you think we wouldn't? But they destroyed the brains.
TomChivers	714791440895836161	2016-03-29T12:28:54	alexhern (and yes I know I'm not arguing with your point that only rich people *actually do* it, because I don't really care if it's true.)
TomChivers	714791283315851264	2016-03-29T12:28:16	alexhern 5% chance of hugely extended life for £200/year or whatever sounds good to me. A 0.005% chance doesn't. Just depends on yr priors.
TomChivers	714790957351362560	2016-03-29T12:26:59	alexhern true. But, again, it comes down to whether you think it's a non-mad idea. If you do, then it's a lot less silly than £12 ketchup.
TomChivers	714790113331515392	2016-03-29T12:23:37	alexhern …then giving up smoking and using the money for cryonics would be a good idea. (It would be even if cryonics is a total scam, too)
TomChivers	714789958649782272	2016-03-29T12:23:00	alexhern I think it's fair to say that not only rich people smoke or have cable telly, though. If you think cryonics is a worthwhile bet…
TomChivers	714789695356534784	2016-03-29T12:21:58	rbp77 yeah it's not freezing, it's vitrification (I learned from that Wait But Why piece). Blood (&amp; water) replaced  with glass-like fluid
TomChivers	714789397284200448	2016-03-29T12:20:47	rbp77 from a gambler's point of view, I'd say it's a worthwhile punt. Whether it works or not we can't know without hindsight
TomChivers	714789248197636097	2016-03-29T12:20:11	rbp77 you could. You probably would. But the point is, if there's a non-negligible chance of it working, it's a huge reward at small cost.
TomChivers	714788044491124736	2016-03-29T12:15:24	But I probably won't, because I'm lazy and too afraid of the social stigma (cryonics being seen as a sort of mad cult). Which is silly.
TomChivers	714787844859031552	2016-03-29T12:14:36	Depends on cost I guess, but it's a gamble: I'd happily pay a non-negligible amount for, say, a 10% chance of enormously prolonged life.
TomChivers	714787259464204288	2016-03-29T12:12:17	Wait But Why on cryonics  I find myself more and more thinking it's a good idea. Or at least a not mad one.
TomChivers	714784730609238016	2016-03-29T12:02:14	helen_hollins I don't know. I didn't think so
TomChivers	714783607873748993	2016-03-29T11:57:46	TonyHill_7 …which they know many people won't clear (or notice, in the fine print), so they can spam people with some legal cover.
TomChivers	714783383541383168	2016-03-29T11:56:53	TonyHill_7 yes. They don't give me an option to *tick a box* saying "Don't contact me in the first place". It's a deliberately high hurdle…
TomChivers	714779689261408256	2016-03-29T11:42:12	rbp77 exactly. Unacceptable.

TomChivers	710083181152739328	2016-03-16T12:39:57	MissEllieMae I've spoken to lots as part of the day job. They tend to say, this is serious, take it seriously, but not "we're all doomed".
TomChivers	710082876172333057	2016-03-16T12:38:45	TheSimonEvans well, good thing really. Be a shame if antibiotics killed your kids
TomChivers	710082694802247680	2016-03-16T12:38:01	MissEllieMae but that may be just because I'm naturally optimistic. Lots of people who know this stuff are much more concerned, obviously.
TomChivers	710082573247127552	2016-03-16T12:37:32	MissEllieMae I'm… not relaxed about it. It's the biggest problem and there will be bad things. But I think it'll be broadly OK, eventually.
TomChivers	710081975550349312	2016-03-16T12:35:10	MissEllieMae is that true? (Honest question. Haven't seen any research on it.)
TomChivers	710081500717383681	2016-03-16T12:33:17	MissEllieMae that's for most emissions scenario, prob slightly higher than "no action"  
TomChivers	710081121120288768	2016-03-16T12:31:46	MissEllieMae "may" rather than "will" I think. Climate predictions v tricky. (Could be more, ofc. IPCC 95% conf interval ≈ 2.5C to 5.5C).

TomChivers	710076108289548288	2016-03-16T12:11:51	but that's the worst thing you can do, because it leaves more (potentially resistant) bacteria alive and reproducing. And since antibiotic…
TomChivers	710075781175758849	2016-03-16T12:10:33	lots of people get that wrong, &amp; think the drugs make *them* resistant. So, they reasonably think, taking less means they get less resistant
TomChivers	710075380560961537	2016-03-16T12:08:57	OK this piece is wrong in a subtle but v important way. Children aren't "resistant to antibiotics" – bacteria are.

TomChivers	704713683071541249	2016-03-01T17:03:29	greatbigkev NickyAACampbell I spend too much time on Twitter. Bill Bryson's Short History of Nearly Everything excellent on this stuff
TomChivers	704712302621233152	2016-03-01T16:58:00	greatbigkev NickyAACampbell bit of both (tho not carbon as carbon-14 half life only decades or centuries. Can't remember what isotope.)

TomChivers	704711844842381312	2016-03-01T16:56:11	greatbigkev NickyAACampbell …but short answer iirc is: older fossils are in lower geo layers, &amp; can get date of layers using radioisotopes
TomChivers	704711597885886465	2016-03-01T16:55:12	greatbigkev NickyAACampbell not silly question; complicated question with fascinating answer which is much too long to fully detail here…
TomChivers	704710986310283264	2016-03-01T16:52:46	"arguing on Twitter about climate change" is what "pointlessness" wants to be when it grows up
TomChivers	704710656528883712	2016-03-01T16:51:28	peden_c yes, we do.
TomChivers	704707496099901441	2016-03-01T16:38:54	peden_c that's not true, I'm afraid. But I don't think this is something that we'll successfully settle on Twitter so let's agree to differ
TomChivers	704706073073197056	2016-03-01T16:33:15	bowmanthebard JamesDelingpole OK. I don't think that's true (see eg this excellent blog ) but let's agree to differ
TomChivers	704704626315104257	2016-03-01T16:27:30	bowmanthebard JamesDelingpole and people have done that, alongside models. (Which are also important, btw.) see eg 
TomChivers	704702363727224833	2016-03-01T16:18:30	peden_c the falsification/induction debate is interesting, but "the world is warming" is has not been falsified, so it doesn't apply here.
TomChivers	704701710523047936	2016-03-01T16:15:55	bowmanthebard JamesDelingpole (which seems to be the consensus position of climate scientists, not that that means anything around here)
TomChivers	704701551185698817	2016-03-01T16:15:17	bowmanthebard JamesDelingpole if that's the worst mistake I've made, I'm OK with that. But it's "simple" as in more comes in than goes out
TomChivers	704698368375857152	2016-03-01T16:02:38	peden_c JamesDelingpole …is that HTML?
TomChivers	704697931320823808	2016-03-01T16:00:54	JamesDelingpole yup. It saved time. It still won't achieve anything, of course, but at least it failed to achieve it *quickly*.
TomChivers	704697179450052609	2016-03-01T15:57:54	JamesDelingpole I've given up arguing on Twitter, especially on this stuff. Nothing is achieved. Call it pompous if you like.
TomChivers	704696229830250496	2016-03-01T15:54:08	JamesDelingpole if you must, though, you can explain why you are so trusting of The Scientists when it's convenient, but not at other times
TomChivers	704696054281854977	2016-03-01T15:53:26	JamesDelingpole don't feel you have to be. I don't think this is a particularly productive use of our time.
TomChivers	704694884263976960	2016-03-01T15:48:47	JamesDelingpole righto. I was going to do this as a sequence of tweets but it's easier just to post the screengrab 
TomChivers	704688650823606276	2016-03-01T15:24:01	john_self oh yeah. I reckon about 40-ish. I put 39% because it's slightly more insulting to future Twibbon-wearers if it's below 40.
TomChivers	704684827199578112	2016-03-01T15:08:49	DeborahLoudon now I'm nervous that everyone read it like that and think I'm already wearing my own Twibbon

TomChivers	704682944225550337	2016-03-01T15:01:20	DeborahLoudon I don't think they had Twibbons in 1975

TomChivers	704659807274409984	2016-03-01T13:29:24	garwboy I don't think so. It's a tweet. It's publicly available. You wouldn't have to ask my permission to link to an article I wrote.

TomChivers	704603954911518721	2016-03-01T09:47:28	1703John ah I should re-read that. Although you then need to read Darwin's Dangerous Idea by Daniel Dennett.

TomChivers	704272518371270656	2016-02-29T11:50:27	Mrs_FrancesJ Hi Frances. I'm writing a piece about scientists and their attitudes to the EU referendum. Do you have a sec to talk to me?
TomChivers	704272017810444289	2016-02-29T11:48:28	BelindaBG Hi Dr Brooks-Gordon. I'm a science writer with BuzzFeed. I'm talking to scientists about the EU ref; do you have a sec to chat?
TomChivers	704268160422256640	2016-02-29T11:33:08	Siobhan_ODwyer hi Dr O'Dwyer. Tom Chivers here from BuzzFeed. Am writing on scientists' attitudes to the EU ref. Do you have a sec to chat?
TomChivers	704264619754459136	2016-02-29T11:19:04	sam_shughes hi Samantha. Tom Chivers here; I'm a science writer with BuzzFeed. Would you be willing to talk to me about science and the EU?
TomChivers	704264361238519808	2016-02-29T11:18:02	DianaRoettger hi Diana. Tom Chivers here from BuzzFeed. I'm writing a piece about science and the EU – would you want to talk to me for it?
TomChivers	704263547430313984	2016-02-29T11:14:48	enhughesiasm you can make these narratives and maybe they're real but generally "any centrist candidate" beats "firebrand" in gen election
TomChivers	704263221402857474	2016-02-29T11:13:31	enhughesiasm idk if it's actual nonsense. Just seems v unlikely. Trump and Sanders both alienate large swathes of centrist voters.
TomChivers	704260524477980672	2016-02-29T11:02:48	MarcusMunafo 1703John yeah I've been there. It's tricky when you've got a live one who's spouting off.
TomChivers	704256524919705600	2016-02-29T10:46:54	Dskews base that on no data, and I'm not a psephologist, so I may be completely wrong. But I mean come on it's Donald Trump
TomChivers	704256357097185280	2016-02-29T10:46:14	Dskews this far out, though… I dunno. I just assume that his obvious awfulness would alienate enough centrists to hold nose &amp; vote Hillary.
TomChivers	704255496119836672	2016-02-29T10:42:49	only Sanders, not Clinton, can beat Trump, says this piece  nonsense dressed up in a plauslble-sounding narrative?
TomChivers	704248334601592832	2016-02-29T10:14:21	PCollinsTimes if I'm honest my main reason for voting Remain will be because it will annoy people who I enjoy seeing annoyed
TomChivers	704246243254468609	2016-02-29T10:06:03	TheStaunton edwest AdamRutherford just one of several obvious questions raised, yes.
TomChivers	704245602981429248	2016-02-29T10:03:30	iainmartin1 weird to have him spouting that. Borders on "getting David Bellamy on to talk about climate change" levels of sci incompetence
TomChivers	704245281299275776	2016-02-29T10:02:13	PatrickStrud ("shared environment" being science-nerd speak for "parents and upbringing", essentially.)
TomChivers	704245134054068226	2016-02-29T10:01:38	PatrickStrud did he really? Wonder which paper he misunderstood to get that from. Shared environment either small influence or none, AFAICT
TomChivers	704240627031134208	2016-02-29T09:43:44	StuartJRitchie AdamRutherford you seen James's piece from y'day? ^^
TomChivers	704240459464441857	2016-02-29T09:43:04	1703John wasn't MarcusMunafo on there? Did he get a word in edgeways to say "um no hang on" or was he talking about a different topic?
TomChivers	704240329751465984	2016-02-29T09:42:33	Oh. James wrote a piece for the Observer on genes &amp; intelligence, and afaict it's gibbering nonsense  HT donbrownesq
TomChivers	704239769631498240	2016-02-29T09:40:19	ceterisparibusy mad as a spoon. Bizarre.
TomChivers	704239681957974016	2016-02-29T09:39:58	You_what1000 which I'm currently reading, as it happens
TomChivers	704238566692536320	2016-02-29T09:35:33	(I've only just come out of conference and not been listening, just heard the trail for it on r4today. Is that what he's actually saying?)
TomChivers	704238370915020800	2016-02-29T09:34:46	apparently he's saying that genes have no influence on intelligence. Which is bizarre and false, if he's saying it. 
TomChivers	703873606846173184	2016-02-28T09:25:19	jamesofputney Janine's tweet was actually what made me go and switch it on in the first place
TomChivers	703869140633780224	2016-02-28T09:07:35	Switched on the Andrew Marr show. My son (2) calmly got up, walked over to the telly and switched it back off again.
TomChivers	703592155965739009	2016-02-27T14:46:56	Wow. Compared to the others, Matt Perry has really aged. 
TomChivers	703621643566878721	2016-02-27T16:44:07	Excellent planetmoney run various proposals from US presidential hopefuls past economists. Proposals mostly suck.

TomChivers	703266970041454592	2016-02-26T17:14:46	NickyWoolf kadhimshubber *apparently* I have to do "things for the actual website once in a while too, you know, Tom". Fucking penpushers
TomChivers	703266737358245889	2016-02-26T17:13:50	NickyWoolf kadhimshubber nice. Right, I'm going home because I'm just faffing around on Twitter

TomChivers	703266308318748672	2016-02-26T17:12:08	kadhimshubber NickyWoolf still is. Comparison maybe closer w/ Iron Cross? Would be places it'd be insensitive but it's not a fascist thing
TomChivers	703266111861743616	2016-02-26T17:11:21	kadhimshubber NickyWoolf (getting up to speed rapidly) I think comparisons w/ swastika a bit unfair, because it was used long before and…
TomChivers	703265783338672128	2016-02-26T17:10:03	kadhimshubber NickyWoolf *think* I'm OK w/ using it, but sentence after one I've highlighted gives me some pause 
TomChivers	703265318974705668	2016-02-26T17:08:12	kadhimshubber NickyWoolf expressing ignorance: Is that what it is? Is it associated only with expansionist 30s/40s Japan or more broadly?
