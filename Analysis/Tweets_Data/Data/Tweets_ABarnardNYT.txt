ABarnardNYT	686537847621287936	2016-01-11T13:19:12	Excellent summary of why Syrians go to Europe from PatrickKingsley who did definitive early coverage of the crisis: 
ABarnardNYT	686537389133721603	2016-01-11T13:17:23	10) Or c) we get rid of the refugee convention.
ABarnardNYT	686537270787178496	2016-01-11T13:16:55	9) And that is likely to remain the case until a) Syrians are given proper status in the ME; b) West begins to resettle signif nos of them
ABarnardNYT	686536868670914560	2016-01-11T13:15:19	8) So with a heavy heart they leave the region they know, &amp; head for Europe––where they will at least be recognised as refugees with rights.
ABarnardNYT	686536032490270721	2016-01-11T13:12:00	7) Their kids won't go to school because they'll be selling flowers at the side of the road.

ABarnardNYT	686535206598217728	2016-01-11T13:08:43	4) But 5 years go by, and it turns out that the war won't end, and the west doesn't really resettle people out of choice.
ABarnardNYT	686534910149050368	2016-01-11T13:07:32	3) But hey, maybe they can weather that indignity while they wait for the war to end – or for the west to resettle them.
ABarnardNYT	686534575573614593	2016-01-11T13:06:12	2) In those countries, they were denied the right to work – a right they are supposed to have according to the 1951 refugee convention.
