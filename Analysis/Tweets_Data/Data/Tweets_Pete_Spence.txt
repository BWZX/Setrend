Pete_Spence	720337825649074176	2016-04-13T19:48:15	janhopis Very much so. Flash casting is a plus. But on subject of cast diversity I think the WW choice was poor on size grounds.
Pete_Spence	720335401165144064	2016-04-13T19:38:37	janhopis Again, something someone who knows the comics expects as a regular Flash device.
Pete_Spence	720335228808499201	2016-04-13T19:37:56	janhopis Which all makes sense if it's Flash time travelling and bringing a vision of the future to Batman.
Pete_Spence	720334921206616064	2016-04-13T19:36:43	janhopis So this stuff all makes sense to the nerds, but feels really weird and unconnected to regular cinema goers IMO.
Pete_Spence	720334607560916993	2016-04-13T19:35:28	janhopis Which all makes sense when you think about Flash saying he/him not Superman, pairing with Lex's he/him at end.
Pete_Spence	720334438207516673	2016-04-13T19:34:47	janhopis You know the winged creatures in the Batman vision scene? Darkseid's minions. Potentially premonition, not nightmare.
Pete_Spence	720333915093929984	2016-04-13T19:32:43	janhopis Also, depending on how much DC Comics you know (do you know Darkseid and his minions?) a few scenes don't make sense
Pete_Spence	720333593474637824	2016-04-13T19:31:26	janhopis But so minor relative to film as a whole
Pete_Spence	720333533617790981	2016-04-13T19:31:12	janhopis Trying to introduce characters by computer with secret footage stored on it was TERRIBLE
Pete_Spence	720333288901058560	2016-04-13T19:30:13	janhopis Yeah, just worth it to make that scene even better IMO
Pete_Spence	720178692861882368	2016-04-13T09:15:55	"Came to her home with two young children" FUCK-ING HELL 
Pete_Spence	720330534472261633	2016-04-13T19:19:17	janhopis If you've watched Man of Steel recently enough before that opening sequence it is really powerful.
Pete_Spence	720284750972383232	2016-04-13T16:17:21	So tom_watson, Lab's deputy leader, cautioned Sunday People against publishing story about Whittindale's affair 
Pete_Spence	720287302216384517	2016-04-13T16:27:29	multiplebears Gross.

Pete_Spence	720180916518305792	2016-04-13T09:24:45	This explains so much  
Pete_Spence	720174818373562369	2016-04-13T09:00:31	dsquareddigest NealHockley What's the real answer? Because he knows how whorephobic people are (including maybe himself) and is worried.
Pete_Spence	720174621329354753	2016-04-13T08:59:44	dsquareddigest NealHockley Yeah, once that happens, I agree you should probably inform those who need to know.
Pete_Spence	720173813133111296	2016-04-13T08:56:31	dsquareddigest NealHockley Report what to who exactly?
Pete_Spence	720173460136337408	2016-04-13T08:55:07	dsquareddigest NealHockley Yeah, I'd argue against that too. But surely Corbyn much better known than Whittingdale, you'd agree?

Pete_Spence	720170081083383808	2016-04-13T08:41:42	dsquareddigest Sure, if there was evidence the story had been hushed up.
Pete_Spence	720163880165634048	2016-04-13T08:17:03	janhopis I think this makes the distinction you're alluding to 
Pete_Spence	720163427164024832	2016-04-13T08:15:15	janhopis Right, but that wouldn't have been a story *before* these allegations have surfaced.
Pete_Spence	720147644069343233	2016-04-13T07:12:32	alexhern This line of questioning I can get on board with.
Pete_Spence	720014563303911424	2016-04-12T22:23:43	TWWelsh Yes. That paired with his voting record on sex work make a much stronger case for a public interest story I think.
Pete_Spence	720010534578425858	2016-04-12T22:07:43	georgepearkes Who desire protection of celeb's privacy, but think absolutely right to run this story. Bizarre and hypocritical.
Pete_Spence	720010423655931905	2016-04-12T22:07:16	georgepearkes It's been suggested there has been a conflict of interest. My grievance is with Hacked Off - a pro press-regulation lobby.
Pete_Spence	720010166616371200	2016-04-12T22:06:15	georgepearkes It has been revealed that the UK minister with responsibility for press regulation had a relationship with a sex worker.
Pete_Spence	720009960726401024	2016-04-12T22:05:26	If you don't have a problem with sex workers, the story is "man has relationship with woman with job".
Pete_Spence	720009726340296705	2016-04-12T22:04:30	There is not a story in a single man having a relationship with a sex worker unless you think there is something wrong with sex work.
Pete_Spence	720003996052754435	2016-04-12T21:41:44	moorehn Absolutely - NOW I am worried about the industry

Pete_Spence	719530400809422849	2016-04-11T14:19:50	tim_harper_88 horton_official That's evasion though, not avoidance.

Pete_Spence	719497046143668224	2016-04-11T12:07:18	VienneseStrudel horton_official hugorifkind Which is why we should distinguish between "avoidance" generally and avoidance we dislike.
Pete_Spence	719496805386493952	2016-04-11T12:06:20	alexhern That may be what you want the definition to be - but I think it's fairly well accepted that that's not what it is.
Pete_Spence	719496382877462528	2016-04-11T12:04:39	VienneseStrudel horton_official hugorifkind You still reduced your tax bill! You could have paid more in tax.
Pete_Spence	719496192804188161	2016-04-11T12:03:54	horton_official hugorifkind No, you don't need to do it intentionally for that reason. Avoidance doesn't require intent.
Pete_Spence	719496070351425536	2016-04-11T12:03:25	alexhern Tax avoidance is anything that legally reduces your tax bill. That's the definition, no?
Pete_Spence	719495955939205120	2016-04-11T12:02:58	horton_official hugorifkind Ever bought a cake instead of a biscuit? No VAT on cakes - is on biscuits. You'd have reduced your tax bill.
Pete_Spence	719495627466477572	2016-04-11T12:01:39	kentindell By tax planning do you only mean legal measures? If so, it's just a subset.
Pete_Spence	719495310196809728	2016-04-11T12:00:24	We really need to do a better job at distinguishing "aggressive" avoidance from avoidance generally, which is everywhere!

Pete_Spence	719126690811813888	2016-04-10T11:35:38	I think the key here is that the public acknowledges the person as an "economist". Theresa May was a BoE economist, but how many know that?

Pete_Spence	719125787388080128	2016-04-10T11:32:03	SamuelMarcLowe I think Osborne/Brown/Balls are strong suggestions. Although Varoufakis would have done well last summer...

Pete_Spence	719124816469606400	2016-04-10T11:28:11	HarryAEvans Maybe. I think more likely that both are pointless.
Pete_Spence	719124694310502400	2016-04-10T11:27:42	Zettel314 GavinHJackson Will people associate him strongly enough with "economist" though? Or just "stats guy"?
Pete_Spence	719124567789334528	2016-04-10T11:27:12	GavinHJackson I think Piketty is most likely of any of those. I don't think people recognise authors/columnists who aren't on TV a lot.

Pete_Spence	719099482844098560	2016-04-10T09:47:31	AnnabelLGrey AbiWilks SMTuffy Well, choosing to buy cakes (no VAT) rather than biscuits (VAT applies) is a form of tax avoidance.
Pete_Spence	719098518678421505	2016-04-10T09:43:41	AnnabelLGrey MichaelPDeacon AbiWilks SMTuffy No. What tax did he avoid?

Pete_Spence	719097001351245824	2016-04-10T09:37:39	AnnabelLGrey MichaelPDeacon AbiWilks No he didn't. As SMTuffy just pointed out, he benefited from an Irish UCITS fund.

Pete_Spence	718826299809263616	2016-04-09T15:41:59	GavinHJackson Which ones are they? Haven't seen them in any of the event material, placards, etc.
Pete_Spence	718825982195580928	2016-04-09T15:40:43	GavinHJackson Sure, maybe everyone has been protesting zero rated VAT on some products then.
Pete_Spence	718825018298363904	2016-04-09T15:36:54	GavinHJackson Buying zero-rated VAT goods, using an ISA etc, these are avoidance, but not things HMRC would retroactively move on, surely?
Pete_Spence	718824898236399617	2016-04-09T15:36:25	GavinHJackson There is a subset of avoidance that is murky - "aggressive avoidance" maybe - but some things are crystal clear.
Pete_Spence	718824757672742912	2016-04-09T15:35:52	GavinHJackson They do. To me, evasion is breaking tax law. Avoidance is anything which legally reduces the amount of tax you pay.

Pete_Spence	714841182979883010	2016-03-29T15:46:33	MayfairCynic alanbeattie moyeenislam You don't think that how appealing exercise is will make a difference to demand? At all?
Pete_Spence	714838160023359488	2016-03-29T15:34:33	alanbeattie moyeenislam A missing would, but yeah, it is. I can't recall a piece of school homework that required anything like that.
Pete_Spence	714837945262452736	2016-03-29T15:33:41	moyeenislam alanbeattie I think we need some data.
Pete_Spence	714837677300916224	2016-03-29T15:32:37	alanbeattie moyeenislam I think you are envisaging a world in which school kids go to libraries en masse to do homework.
Pete_Spence	714837526515695616	2016-03-29T15:32:02	alanbeattie moyeenislam Why would you need staff (security aside) and why you need help looking stuff up for school homework?
Pete_Spence	714837090287149056	2016-03-29T15:30:18	alanbeattie moyeenislam If that's the need, then why don't we just provide council meeting rooms? No need for other costs.
Pete_Spence	714836437544353792	2016-03-29T15:27:42	alanbeattie moyeenislam Then, IMO, you're looking at private sector substitutes that are too narrow.
Pete_Spence	714836298838749188	2016-03-29T15:27:09	moyeenislam alanbeattie I think books (not convinced by need for shared learning spaces) are now provided as well by private sector.
Pete_Spence	714835248006168576	2016-03-29T15:22:58	alanbeattie moyeenislam Are there any conditions under which you would support shifting library funding to gym funding?
Pete_Spence	714834875950501889	2016-03-29T15:21:30	moyeenislam alanbeattie lambeth_council Limits on access to books are also declining, unless you mean very specific + new books.
Pete_Spence	714834539382747136	2016-03-29T15:20:09	alanbeattie moyeenislam lambeth_council Do you disagree that relative importance is shifting?

Pete_Spence	711290399135035393	2016-03-19T20:37:00	AbiWilks janhopis Why baked beans though? So many things pair more nicely with cheese than baked beans. Practically any food.
Pete_Spence	711290042191355904	2016-03-19T20:35:35	janhopis Why does that not surprise me.
Pete_Spence	711290010604052480	2016-03-19T20:35:28	AbiWilks janhopis Never disagreed with you more strongly.

Pete_Spence	711282168513875969	2016-03-19T20:04:18	janhopis AbiWilks Ned_Donovan Obviously in hypotheticals where you have all the info, and there aren't knock on incentives, you say "no".

Pete_Spence	711279255276150784	2016-03-19T19:52:44	AbiWilks Ned_Donovan janhopis I'd do that with a shoplifter.
Pete_Spence	711279076003209217	2016-03-19T19:52:01	janhopis AbiWilks In abstract hypotheticals, yeah. But I also think that norms/rules being applied evenly matters for deterrent effects.

Pete_Spence	711278508492902400	2016-03-19T19:49:45	janhopis AbiWilks Ethically I guess. This idea that it is dependent on cost of damage done/victim's wealth is odd to me.

Pete_Spence	711277110866870272	2016-03-19T19:44:12	janhopis "This" meaning apprehend and report to the police.
Pete_Spence	711277008442015744	2016-03-19T19:43:48	janhopis So if you had an Audi A4? A Ford Focus? What's the cost of the car that makes this appropriate.
Pete_Spence	711275827221172224	2016-03-19T19:39:06	janhopis No, sure. But you would pursue and apprehend right?

Pete_Spence	710137968573464576	2016-03-16T16:17:40	Mr_A_McSquiffy AbiWilks The IFS document linked to explains why this is not the case. It's mildly progressive.
Pete_Spence	710136677424041985	2016-03-16T16:12:32	AbiWilks Sure. Technical point that VAT isn't regressive (as it is now) is important though.
Pete_Spence	710131773523496960	2016-03-16T15:53:03	AbiWilks I think the IFS is fairly persuasive. Go the NZ route, and have equal consumption taxes on everything, and redistribute more.
Pete_Spence	710129744226942976	2016-03-16T15:44:59	izzyfraser Do not encourage.
Pete_Spence	710128254892568576	2016-03-16T15:39:04	AbiWilks VAT isn't regressive, it's progressive (see IFS research ). A sugar tax would be regressive, however.

Pete_Spence	692723922077421568	2016-01-28T15:00:27	Henry_Curr My story is that a lack of verbal intervention by the FOMC this month has compounded things. It's a third factor.
Pete_Spence	692723756146561025	2016-01-28T14:59:48	Henry_Curr Oh sure, but that's why I'm saying it's not the December rate rise, as per my initial tweet.
Pete_Spence	692723291304390656	2016-01-28T14:57:57	Henry_Curr Nah. Insufficient dovishness in recent speeches is an antagonist, IMO.
Pete_Spence	692723088996331520	2016-01-28T14:57:09	Henry_Curr But there are opportunities to soothe markets via verbal inteventions before. How many on FOMC have done so?

Pete_Spence	692721588895125504	2016-01-28T14:51:11	Henry_Curr Because that rate rise isn't what people are looking at. It's guidance from the - still very steep - dots about what's coming.

Pete_Spence	692703150147502080	2016-01-28T13:37:55	LadyFOHF Oh definitely, and my view is that kids without families are often *not* protected.
Pete_Spence	692702686723055616	2016-01-28T13:36:04	LadyFOHF Definitely very difficult. Not sure about the should be. Research I've seen seems to suggest almost any family &gt; the care system.

Pete_Spence	691735917153886208	2016-01-25T21:34:29	ndrlee No chance you have any drafts to hand, or that the think tank might?
Pete_Spence	691735557710450688	2016-01-25T21:33:03	resi_analyst IsabelHardman AFAICT this phenomenon does not affect overall seasonal pattern of births vs other countries.
Pete_Spence	691735439661764609	2016-01-25T21:32:35	resi_analyst IsabelHardman I think important fact is that Sept/Oct births skew higher SES, not calendar distribution of births by month.

Pete_Spence	691732301122772993	2016-01-25T21:20:07	This phenomenon is very well known to me, discussed by lots of middle class parents. But I keep stumbling on people who've not heard of it.
Pete_Spence	691732112345583616	2016-01-25T21:19:22	POLL: Are you aware of British parents having planned their child's birth to coincide with the start of school year?
Pete_Spence	691731578880442368	2016-01-25T21:17:14	All transcripts from Steven Avery's trial are now available - I may be some time 
Pete_Spence	691731220699422721	2016-01-25T21:15:49	GrantLewis1 oditorium While you can't collect good data for third, I would say that you can make a strong case it'd be linked with second.
Pete_Spence	691730996941692932	2016-01-25T21:14:56	GrantLewis1 oditorium What I've linked suggests the second is definitely significant (and matches up with what theory would suggest).
Pete_Spence	691730876678287360	2016-01-25T21:14:27	GrantLewis1 oditorium Most of the discussion focuses on the first, I think because the data is most easily acquired.
Pete_Spence	691730740829093888	2016-01-25T21:13:55	GrantLewis1 oditorium AFAICT there are three big factors: Development time, background of parents, and weight parents place on education
Pete_Spence	691728361094258688	2016-01-25T21:04:27	antonyslumbers oditorium You also find discussions on how to do it on all the big parenting web forums.
Pete_Spence	691728255452340224	2016-01-25T21:04:02	antonyslumbers oditorium Not everyone does it, but many middle class parents do. Shows up in the data.
Pete_Spence	691728103819907072	2016-01-25T21:03:26	GrantLewis1 oditorium Here's some US evidence that parents of higher SES are more likely to plan births 
Pete_Spence	691727841248088065	2016-01-25T21:02:23	GrantLewis1 oditorium IFS finds children eligible for free school meals are ~2.7pp more likely to be born in Aug (ie Summer Born).
Pete_Spence	691723760580296714	2016-01-25T20:46:10	oditorium It's a unique-ish phenomenon in the UK because of very rigid school start rules. Exists in US for parents who care about sports.
Pete_Spence	691723537321705472	2016-01-25T20:45:17	oditorium I notice the BBC piece utterly fails to make these points. Which in turn reinforces the idea that planning is what matters.
Pete_Spence	691723172111081475	2016-01-25T20:43:50	oditorium It's really popular.
Pete_Spence	691723116763045888	2016-01-25T20:43:37	oditorium How much is development time? How much is higher SES? How much is that parents who care about education outcomes plan births?
Pete_Spence	691722950601474048	2016-01-25T20:42:57	oditorium Middle class parents "know" about the premium, and plan births accordingly. August-born kid much more likely to be of high SES.
Pete_Spence	691722562720681984	2016-01-25T20:41:25	oditorium No, no. There are huge problems with these calculations.

Pete_Spence	691714566301077504	2016-01-25T20:09:38	GavinHJackson You could have contracts between multiple individuals, you could terminate the contract for any reason you define in it, etc.

Pete_Spence	691713852485009411	2016-01-25T20:06:48	GavinHJackson Sure. All contracts are. When I say "no part", I'm fine with enforcement, I'm not with definition/approval etc.
