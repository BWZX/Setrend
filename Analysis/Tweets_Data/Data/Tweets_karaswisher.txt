karaswisher	717794065320808448	2016-04-06T19:20:15	modestproposal1 yes I think I said that clearly. She is buying revenue and at what cost?
karaswisher	717791809481486337	2016-04-06T19:11:17	binarybits this is well known!
karaswisher	717791722323910656	2016-04-06T19:10:57	modestproposal1 btw yahoo will then sell more patents to make it up (my guess)
karaswisher	717791598948384768	2016-04-06T19:10:27	modestproposal1 the ebidta decline is riveting.
karaswisher	717791155811782656	2016-04-06T19:08:42	modestproposal1 Yes, but add in the tac, the stock comp issues and something yahoo is calling ‚Äúcounter revenue‚Äù WHAT IS THAT?
karaswisher	717790883664429056	2016-04-06T19:07:37	modestproposal1 WHICH I NOTE! She refuses in meetings to say what profit is. I suspect $1.
karaswisher	717790740311445504	2016-04-06T19:07:03	modestproposal1 yes. want to write a piece for re/code. we like a debate!

karaswisher	717788006032117760	2016-04-06T18:56:11	modestproposal1 but will make it clearer. to me the new mobile search costs are most interesting
karaswisher	717787757733482496	2016-04-06T18:55:11	modestproposal1 since I have been 100 percent right about yahoo for years now, despite cheerleaders of late, am going with me on this mess

karaswisher	692455258149253120	2016-01-27T21:12:53	jeremymbarr in your heart, you know trying to assert an inadequate little tweet is good enough is sad.

karaswisher	692453010862129155	2016-01-27T21:03:57	jeremymbarr I don't want to fight w/Mike over this. But it's not what we strive 4 at re/code where he worked, to not give readers the best

karaswisher	692451187434622984	2016-01-27T20:56:42	jeremymbarr when there is more space on Twitter, we will break stories there. But short tweets now have zero to do with quality or readers
karaswisher	692450742775451648	2016-01-27T20:54:56	jeremymbarr I would never let him try to give readers less than a full report if goal was just to say me first. Again, that is sad to me.
karaswisher	692450375840960513	2016-01-27T20:53:29	jeremymbarr anyway KurtWagner8 did amazing reporting work that others chased which is all that counts.
karaswisher	692449717733695489	2016-01-27T20:50:52	jeremymbarr thus, it was about not appearing slow rather than an actual quality report. NYT is better than that, which is why I read it
karaswisher	692449370583781376	2016-01-27T20:49:29	jeremymbarr and that the sad little tweet was as good as a full story appearing seconds later. It you are a wire service, I'd expect that.
karaswisher	692448921231192065	2016-01-27T20:47:42	jeremymbarr I was making point that it was sad to me that stellar news org like NYT felt getting a tweet up was good enough for readers
