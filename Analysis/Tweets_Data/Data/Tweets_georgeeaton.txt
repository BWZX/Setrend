georgeeaton	710158993625374720	2016-03-16T17:41:12	I reckon it doesn't matter one bit that George Osborne keeps breaking his own fiscal rules. Here's why: 
georgeeaton	710120490795450368	2016-03-16T15:08:13	Osborne gives himself a legacy in case of political death, writes georgeeaton. Budget2016.  
georgeeaton	710159356826927104	2016-03-16T17:42:39	Osborne in his 2010 Budget: "Capital gains tax should increase in order to help create a fairer tax system".
georgeeaton	710101866550599680	2016-03-16T13:54:12	Biggest single revenue raiser over next 5yrs announced in table 2.1 of the Budget2016 Red Book is the PIP cut for disabled - £4.2 bn
georgeeaton	710135220276764672	2016-03-16T16:06:44	Osborne's sugar levy continues partial conversion to interventionism (Living Wage, Apprenticeship Levy). Budget2016 
georgeeaton	710133178514743296	2016-03-16T15:58:38	AbiWilks Possibly, though tend to focus on big picture politics.
georgeeaton	710132343651094528	2016-03-16T15:55:19	Plough your way through to the very end of the Red Book you will discover net public investment falls from £35bn in 15/16 to £32bn 19/20
georgeeaton	710130947400851457	2016-03-16T15:49:46	Under "low tax" Chancellor, tax revenue will be 36.3% of GDP this year - higher than at any time under last Labour govt. Budget2016

georgeeaton	710121102530514944	2016-03-16T15:10:38	Osborne gives himself a legacy in case of political death - my take on Budget2016. 
georgeeaton	710103957310414848	2016-03-16T14:02:31	Corbyn so loud I'm tempted to suggest ear plugs for journalists (like at My Bloody Valentine gigs). Budget2016
georgeeaton	710102322161061888	2016-03-16T13:56:01	Osborne delivers a greatest hits package: my quick take on the budget:  
georgeeaton	710102117386686465	2016-03-16T13:55:12	LabourLeft They can multi-task but have you heard many cheers?
georgeeaton	710101827057012736	2016-03-16T13:54:03	Corbyn making big picture attack, rather than getting trapped in Budget detail, as Dannythefink advised. Budget2016
georgeeaton	710101357198503936	2016-03-16T13:52:11	This is one of Corbyn's better Commons performances. I've seen worse budget responses in past few years. Ed had some howlers.
georgeeaton	710100448884224000	2016-03-16T13:48:34	Corbyn delivering clear and punchy response. But lacks memorable lines and gags. Budget2016
georgeeaton	710099453341011968	2016-03-16T13:44:37	Notable how many Labour MPs are looking through Budget, rather than listening to/cheering Corbyn. Budget2016
georgeeaton	710097570262032384	2016-03-16T13:37:08	The question hanging over this Budget: will Osborne soon to have make way for the "next generation"? Budget2016
georgeeaton	710095371272327168	2016-03-16T13:28:24	If fuel duty frozen now with oil prices so low, it is effectively never going 2 be put up again. Has become the new council tax revaluation
georgeeaton	710095147757936641	2016-03-16T13:27:30	This could be Osborne's last Budget. Sugar levy gives him a legacy. Budget2016
georgeeaton	710094699286155264	2016-03-16T13:25:43	This sugary drinks tax is almost identical to one worked up but dumped in HMT before 2010, down to North London friendly smoothie exemption
georgeeaton	710094183978147841	2016-03-16T13:23:41	Osborne entirely right to pull sugar tax out of the "too difficult" box. Budget2016
georgeeaton	710093703340298240	2016-03-16T13:21:46	A sugar-based rabbit. Budget2016
georgeeaton	710093487413268484	2016-03-16T13:20:54	Osborne's "rollercoaster" is back. From £21.4bn deficit to £10.4bn surplus in one year. That'll never happen. Budget2016
georgeeaton	710092331337322496	2016-03-16T13:16:19	Main point that strikes me so far is that forecast for 2019/20 surplus involves £30bn fiscal turnaround one ONE year!!
georgeeaton	710092028479184896	2016-03-16T13:15:07	Osborne right to give London control of business rates. Absurd that it keeps just 7% of tax revenue, compared to New York's 50%. Budget2016
georgeeaton	710090656685924352	2016-03-16T13:09:40	Yep, it was. Budget2016
georgeeaton	710090355321004032	2016-03-16T13:08:28	Time for Osborne to point out that Scotland would have become independent in eight days' time with oil revenue more than 90% down.
georgeeaton	710089742650626048	2016-03-16T13:06:02	UK corporation tax rate will be 22 percentage points lower than US rate by 2020 (39% vs. 17%). Budget2016
georgeeaton	710088874568097793	2016-03-16T13:02:35	Decent set of attack lines for Corbyn here: growth down, debt rule broken, £3.5bn extra cuts. Budget2016
georgeeaton	710087353310830592	2016-03-16T12:56:32	Fact that top 1% paid 28% of income tax tells us how high pre-tax inequality is
georgeeaton	710087635990085632	2016-03-16T12:57:39	Big question: can extra £3.5bn of cuts really be delivered through "greater efficiency"? Budget2016
georgeeaton	710086881254445056	2016-03-16T12:54:39	Forecast surplus in 2019-20 slightly up to £10.4bn (+£0.3m). Budget2016

georgeeaton	710085038772232196	2016-03-16T12:47:20	McDonnell shakes his head as Osborne says borrowing would have been £930bn higher under Labour. Budget2016
georgeeaton	710084558276923392	2016-03-16T12:45:26	Quantity of jobs created in the UK has been genuinely remarkable. Every forecast beaten. Budget2016
georgeeaton	710083858906091521	2016-03-16T12:42:39	Tory MPs won't like Osborne harnessing independent OBR over EU membership. Budget2016
georgeeaton	710083180150263812	2016-03-16T12:39:57	Worth recalling that many thought OBR forecasts were over-optimistic last December. Budget2016
georgeeaton	710082247190249472	2016-03-16T12:36:15	The "dangerous cocktail of risks" was there at the Autumn Statement. Osborne just bought into improved OBR forecasts. Budget2016
georgeeaton	710081774873911297	2016-03-16T12:34:22	Osborne begins what will likely be his last Budget if UK votes Leave. Budget2016
georgeeaton	710080227393871873	2016-03-16T12:28:13	Bank of England target is 2% for a reason. PMQs
georgeeaton	710080063954411520	2016-03-16T12:27:34	Inflation at "virtually 0%" is not an economic positive. PMQs
georgeeaton	710078227830726656	2016-03-16T12:20:16	John McDonnell lingering behind the Speaker's chair. No space on the front bench for him - will Diane budge up?
georgeeaton	710078132808761344	2016-03-16T12:19:54	Still no sign of McDonnell.
georgeeaton	710076652877963265	2016-03-16T12:14:01	Nigel Lawson, Andrew Lansley and Stewart Wood among those in the gallery for the Budget.
georgeeaton	710075691337916420	2016-03-16T12:10:12	That was Corbyn's best PMQs for weeks (though bar is low).

georgeeaton	710041567847960576	2016-03-16T09:54:36	Dannythefink Jack_SE15 As did I. We all knew he had read Marx but who knew he was so well-versed in Lenin, Trotsky, Gramsci etc?
georgeeaton	710040787388604418	2016-03-16T09:51:30	A journalist once asked the IFS: “How do you work out a percentage?” 
georgeeaton	710040082187722752	2016-03-16T09:48:42	Pr0Tim Yes, Marx is one thing but citing Lenin and Trotsky as recently as 2006 - when he was standing for leadership - surprised me.
georgeeaton	710039423199662080	2016-03-16T09:46:05	This 2006 interview with John McDonnell I came to via georgeeaton is riveting and important 
georgeeaton	710039333252820992	2016-03-16T09:45:43	Pr0Tim They are relevant as background to his thinking. Had they been said when he was a student I would have ignored them.
georgeeaton	710039122417729536	2016-03-16T09:44:53	Pr0Tim I knew that. But these quotes had never previously been reported and they go beyond anything he's said before.

georgeeaton	684326291483525121	2016-01-05T10:51:16	Watson and others couldn't save Dugher. But Benn and Winterton staying would be a victory for them.
georgeeaton	684324416172482560	2016-01-05T10:43:49	Three shadow cabinet members (Watson, Powell, Ashworth) have condemned sacking of Dugher. Significant show of dissent.

georgeeaton	684323417571590145	2016-01-05T10:39:51	Smart of Cameron to use moment of Labour reshuffle to signal free vote on EU. Hard for opposition to deride Tory divisions.
georgeeaton	684321935518502912	2016-01-05T10:33:58	Significant that Tom Watson, friend of Dugher for 25 years, has said his sacking is "a loss" to the shadow cabinet.

georgeeaton	684320367771516928	2016-01-05T10:27:44	No doubt that Dugher's interventions helped prevent Benn and Winterton from being moved.
georgeeaton	684319633986469888	2016-01-05T10:24:49	Here's MichaelDugher's piece for TheStaggers last week: "A 'revenge reshuffle' would not be very new politics":

georgeeaton	684134070234779649	2016-01-04T22:07:27	To paraphrase Cameron, Corbyn seems to have a tantric approach to reshuffles.
georgeeaton	684133465630072832	2016-01-04T22:05:03	Reshuffle story has changed remarkably little since Oldham. We knew Benn and Eagle were under threat then. Can't be certain of outcome now.
georgeeaton	684129311637516288	2016-01-04T21:48:33	That means no announcements tonight.
