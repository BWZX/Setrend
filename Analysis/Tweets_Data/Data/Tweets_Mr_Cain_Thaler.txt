Mr_Cain_Thaler	686675841091252224	2016-01-11T22:27:32	looknathstry onetoughnerd no, that's you salvaging a narrative. The plan was to use Flint River water while the pipeline was finished.

Mr_Cain_Thaler	686673173765591040	2016-01-11T22:16:57	IUNewsTalk actually Flint's officials made this call

Mr_Cain_Thaler	686653725868486656	2016-01-11T20:59:40	JeremyDeeSelden the problem is I did read it.  It doesn't seem to say what you're suggesting
Mr_Cain_Thaler	686653316378554369	2016-01-11T20:58:02	JeremyDeeSelden there's nothing there that shows anyone knew BEFORE June/July. I did find this though

Mr_Cain_Thaler	686644936591208448	2016-01-11T20:24:44	JeremyDeeSelden I did. It doesn't sound like anyone above DEQ even knew about this until October. The earliest would have been July
Mr_Cain_Thaler	686643613292478465	2016-01-11T20:19:29	JeremyDeeSelden and then the city runs out of money and their services start going offline. So no bad water call I guess.

Mr_Cain_Thaler	686639010723278849	2016-01-11T20:01:11	Because without the emergency manager, the water was still getting shut off in Flint. ArrestGovSnyder
Mr_Cain_Thaler	686638870075731971	2016-01-11T20:00:38	Now that it's pointed out the poor infrastructure was in place, we get "well Snyder subverted Democracy". Which led where? ArrestGovSnyder
Mr_Cain_Thaler	686638184290226178	2016-01-11T19:57:54	What were the first two? Detroit ineptitude finally has consequences? Weather uncooperative?  
Mr_Cain_Thaler	686637869314772993	2016-01-11T19:56:39	The real reason for ArrestGovSnyder hashtag is when the city finally went broke, Lansing wouldn't just bail the Flint cronies out.
Mr_Cain_Thaler	686637530100428800	2016-01-11T19:55:18	Really? Snyder caused Flint's water infrastructure to be inadequate, then drove the city insolvent?  
Mr_Cain_Thaler	686637214441312256	2016-01-11T19:54:03	Obviously Snyder should have fixed the problems Flint created over half a century faster. What a bastard. ArrestGovSnyder
Mr_Cain_Thaler	686636833472655360	2016-01-11T19:52:32	Yes clearly governor of then a year assigning emergency manager to insolvent city is what caused the INFRASTRUCTURE problem ArrestGovSnyder
