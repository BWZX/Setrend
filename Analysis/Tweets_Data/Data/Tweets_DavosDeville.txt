DavosDeville	690886574444273664	2016-01-23T13:19:30	And that concludes Davos 2016. It would be impossible to sum up everything we've achieved, even in a single tweet.
DavosDeville	690875954290429952	2016-01-23T12:37:18	My final Davos Delegate of the Day is Zhang Fangyou. Farewell, Zhang Fangyou!

DavosDeville	690836608728354816	2016-01-23T10:00:57	Space is limited so come early or, preferably, not at all.
DavosDeville	690836326288113664	2016-01-23T09:59:49	My seminar -- Reflections On What My Uber Driver Told Me About The Collaborative Economy -- is at the TDK Ponzu Pyramid from 10.40am.
DavosDeville	690822539728273409	2016-01-23T09:05:02	Honestly. If CEOs knew how to watch TED Talks, this whole conference could be edited back to one afternoon.
DavosDeville	690814799341604864	2016-01-23T08:34:17	Davos Day 4: when panel attendance depends entirely on whether one's checkout is 11am or midday.
DavosDeville	690619759675707393	2016-01-22T19:39:16	To the person who shouted that we "form a human shield around Emma Watson" when Roubini walked in: you are not welcome next year.
DavosDeville	690613556174286848	2016-01-22T19:14:37	Stopped by to the Piano Bar and guess who I bumped into? Every other human currently alive.
DavosDeville	690535451896201216	2016-01-22T14:04:15	Is Sandberg still here? I need to speak to her about my idea for a website that's like Facebook except very expensive.
DavosDeville	690524514745188352	2016-01-22T13:20:48	My Davos Delegate of the Day is none other than Hugh Grant! Congratulations, Hugh!

DavosDeville	690488182807355393	2016-01-22T10:56:26	(Though it's a private meeting, so don't.)
DavosDeville	690487932646461440	2016-01-22T10:55:26	How do we traverse AI's gender inequality? Join me for a colloquium at the Tunnock's Imagineering Rotunda from 2.55pm.
DavosDeville	690476857691619329	2016-01-22T10:11:25	johngapper I think the Ritalin is wearing off.
DavosDeville	690475099879821312	2016-01-22T10:04:26	Gee. People who are wrong a lot about oil sure have plenty of opinions about oil.
DavosDeville	690467698304749568	2016-01-22T09:35:02	Oh my! QR codes! It's the bleeding edge of innovation up here. 
DavosDeville	690451731050790912	2016-01-22T08:31:35	One wonders if they recognise the bulky thing to the left as also a camera.  
DavosDeville	690426055711158272	2016-01-22T06:49:33	Admittedly, everyone's party had DiCaprio, Cameron, Bono and Trudeau. They were like a wandering Mariachi band in a tourist trap.
DavosDeville	690422778718191620	2016-01-22T06:36:32	So Jack Ma's party last night had DiCaprio, Cameron, Bono and Trudeau. Or fairly convincing counterfeits.
DavosDeville	690273437965770752	2016-01-21T20:43:06	Is George Soros is so smart, why's he saying things I disagree with?
DavosDeville	690253422319243265	2016-01-21T19:23:34	Also: Bono Ofutoo. Is that correct?
DavosDeville	690252896865251328	2016-01-21T19:21:29	So is his surname Am? Does one call him William Am?
DavosDeville	690249240480727043	2016-01-21T19:06:57	Are we 100% sure this cauliflower thing hasn't been made up, just to make us look silly?

DavosDeville	690208475339714565	2016-01-21T16:24:58	We're not yet two days in, and the following words have lost all meaning: Disruptive inclusive resonance sustainability development equality
DavosDeville	690146021163278337	2016-01-21T12:16:48	My Davos Delegate of the Day is Toto Wolff. Congratulations, Toto! 
DavosDeville	690120558072176640	2016-01-21T10:35:37	My fund is 30% OFZ treasury bonds, 20% polonium, 20% Caspian Servuga. Are today's developments good or bad pls?
DavosDeville	690112050127900672	2016-01-21T10:01:49	Apologies. The Blogchain salon has been cancelled due to events.
DavosDeville	690103621904699393	2016-01-21T09:28:19	Space is limited, so your type probably shouldn't come.
DavosDeville	690102602734931969	2016-01-21T09:24:16	Is your business ready for the Blogchain revolution? I'll be co-hosting a salon at the Holland &amp; Barrett Fintech Bivouac from 10.15am.
DavosDeville	690096744953151488	2016-01-21T09:01:00	We didn't start the fire ... 
DavosDeville	690090028530307072	2016-01-21T08:34:18	So I bumped into Kevin Spacey at the breakfast buffet. "Excuse me," he said. "You can't smoke in here." Classic Spacey!
DavosDeville	690073929214468101	2016-01-21T07:30:20	This is true. Ski hats are our cosplay.  
DavosDeville	689924033647898624	2016-01-20T21:34:42	nntaleb It's a mystery why you were never invited back.
DavosDeville	689855743420428288	2016-01-20T17:03:20	Clearly, markets have tanked because the cellphone reception up here is erratic.
DavosDeville	689795221618585601	2016-01-20T13:02:51	My WEF16 Delegate of the Day is Dov Seidman. Well done, Dov. 
DavosDeville	689790060204572672	2016-01-20T12:42:20	felixsalmon My views were delivered to the panel by fax, actually. So, technically, I am correct.
DavosDeville	689788840542892032	2016-01-20T12:37:29	I see my comments at the Sustainable Stakeholder Enablement Q&amp;A have had an immediate effect on world markets.
DavosDeville	689765864623751168	2016-01-20T11:06:12	Apologies, this event has been postponed due to market volatility.
DavosDeville	689742911915868160	2016-01-20T09:34:59	Seats are limited, so don't bother coming unless you're somebody.
DavosDeville	689742692172046337	2016-01-20T09:34:07	I'll be co-chairing a panel -- Czechoslovakia at a Crossroads -- at the Mövenpick Disruptor Yurt from 11.25am.
DavosDeville	689739008650428416	2016-01-20T09:19:29	Ditto.
DavosDeville	689738809840422912	2016-01-20T09:18:41	This remains accurate.
DavosDeville	689737401225383937	2016-01-20T09:13:05	Find time to unwind! Perhaps by going to an exclusive party, or by sobbing uncontrollably in your dismal little hotel room.
DavosDeville	689736573802450945	2016-01-20T09:09:48	Reporters are everywhere, so mind your language. Say "mass migration", not immigration. Say "profound social change", not eugenics.
DavosDeville	689735335832592385	2016-01-20T09:04:53	Global Shapers was an intern programme that went Children of the Corn. You must tell them firmly: "get away from me, you dead-eyed freak."
DavosDeville	689734440508100608	2016-01-20T09:01:19	Schwab's town, Schwab's rules. Think of Davos as a geocorporate Playboy Mansion, with Klaus its slightly racist Hugh Hefner.
DavosDeville	689733285753311233	2016-01-20T08:56:44	There's one failsafe way to tell if an event is important: if you're at it, it's not.
DavosDeville	689732235210166272	2016-01-20T08:52:34	WEF badge colour indicates status. We find this system preferable to actually knowing anything.
DavosDeville	689731786461573120	2016-01-20T08:50:47	The Magic Mountain is a famous book about Davos. No one here has read it, of course, but one can guess the general gist from the title.
DavosDeville	689731376120217600	2016-01-20T08:49:09	I am a Davos veteran and as a Davos veteran my advice on Davos is essential. Now will follow my Davos advice.
DavosDeville	689730363757826048	2016-01-20T08:45:07	It's the 68th World Economics Forum, which this year has the theme: "The Fourth Horseman of the Industrial Apocalypse."
DavosDeville	689729354411151360	2016-01-20T08:41:07	Welcome! to Davos 2016. Here in the Alpine village of Wef, nestled in the picturesque mountains of Remontée Mécanique.

DavosDeville	689720089319469056	2016-01-20T08:04:18	Bloody hellfire, it's starting again.
DavosDeville	689577599425708033	2016-01-19T22:38:06	Also, the V should be capitalised.
DavosDeville	689570923339501568	2016-01-19T22:11:34	This is NOT a licenced endorsement. My lawyers have been informed. 
DavosDeville	689542957775589376	2016-01-19T20:20:26	izakaminska TheStalwart How very flamboyant. Ask him to do is winning catchphrase, "why did I miss?"
DavosDeville	689515654723035136	2016-01-19T18:31:57	I'm honoured to accept a Crystal Award in recognition of my work combatting young people.
DavosDeville	689475215022264320	2016-01-19T15:51:15	Aaand here come the journalists. Here to gripe about inequality while having their expenses paid by pornographers, oligarchs and tax exiles.
DavosDeville	689454633446543360	2016-01-19T14:29:28	This is simply not true. The waiters and chambermaids can ski in their lunch hours.  
DavosDeville	689419106823438337	2016-01-19T12:08:18	Ah, crap. Klaus is doing his "sustainable solutions for pivoting the rivers of blood" speech again. 
DavosDeville	689390419365396480	2016-01-19T10:14:18	Just walked past that Joe Weisenthal. He was hyperventilating and hitting his phone with a shoe.
DavosDeville	689377031025401856	2016-01-19T09:21:06	It seems the trial run was a success. So in response to popular demand, Twitter will be switched off for the duration of WEF16.
DavosDeville	689353785391579136	2016-01-19T07:48:44	Journalists complaining about the inaccuracy of Chinese economists is my new favourite irony-lol.
DavosDeville	689075068933136386	2016-01-18T13:21:13	The WEF Global Risks Report: never less than essential.

DavosDeville	559060507031011330	2015-01-24T18:49:46	Thanks once again to my sponsors at FTAlphaville. Until 2016, toodle pip Luxembourg.
DavosDeville	559059304758919168	2015-01-24T18:44:59	If asked to sum up in a single sentence what we've learned at this year's WEF, I probably wouldn't bother.
DavosDeville	559058112913489920	2015-01-24T18:40:15	So that's that. Having shared their insights on geopolitics, the luminaries of telecoms, retailing and airtight packaging solutions depart.
