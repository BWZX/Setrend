amyoleary	694245777145753600	2016-02-01T19:47:46	nicole_soojung Ideally, they should be offering an honorarium/$$ if they can. They don‚Äôt always, but it‚Äôs a + sign they‚Äôll take care of you
amyoleary	694245539320348672	2016-02-01T19:46:49	nicole_soojung Look at past speakers‚Äô rosters from previous years. All white dudes? Not a good sign.

amyoleary	694245039476711424	2016-02-01T19:44:50	nicole_soojung Two, are they asking too much of speakers? Make sure the commitment works for you, not just the conference.
amyoleary	694244881724760064	2016-02-01T19:44:12	nicole_soojung One, look for diversity in the panels/presenters. You don‚Äôt want to be stuck doing too much work b/c they didn‚Äôt diversify.
