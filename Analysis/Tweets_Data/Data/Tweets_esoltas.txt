esoltas	717933430672113664	2016-04-07T04:34:03	interfluidity I.e. what I perceive as high/low critical thinking are more importantly signals of SWFs.

esoltas	717926668535533570	2016-04-07T04:07:10	interfluidity I think we are on the same page on this part.
esoltas	717925606537707520	2016-04-07T04:02:57	interfluidity I disagree here. There is a lot we can say about how people think.
esoltas	717924142817939456	2016-04-07T03:57:08	interfluidity I am using that as shorthand for "president that acts as a projection of values," which seems to be the pro-Bernie arg.

esoltas	717921116170362880	2016-04-07T03:45:07	interfluidity agree, but that's not what i mean. Have you ever heard Sanders weigh arguments for a policy? I haven't.
