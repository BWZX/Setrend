SmallCapLS	699301350690062336	2016-02-15T18:36:49	IvanTheK Very much so. I only mean to suggest that bc voters not in position to separate the two, character matters bc integrity critical
SmallCapLS	699301097400201216	2016-02-15T18:35:48	IvanTheK so if general character doesn't matter and if not distinguishable from integrity, then we'd only be voting on executive competence
SmallCapLS	699300875425058817	2016-02-15T18:34:55	IvanTheK and w/out confidence in integrity, a candidate's positions are meaningless as they are fx of electoral context &amp; not his/her views
SmallCapLS	699300376864911362	2016-02-15T18:32:56	IvanTheK Character? No. Integrity? Yes. Issue is we dont know candidates well enough to ignore neg signals re: former as signals for latter

SmallCapLS	696034973346828288	2016-02-06T18:17:24	BrattleStCap I think you'd have to segregate by leverage; many face capital structure challenges independent of business/roll-up quality

SmallCapLS	695838822945394688	2016-02-06T05:17:58	Jesse_Livermore ...because people tend to mentally weigh cost of a purchase as a percentage of their (total) income
SmallCapLS	695838558612025344	2016-02-06T05:16:55	Jesse_Livermore and there is also the psychological difference, however (ir)ational, btw more money coming in vs less money going out...

SmallCapLS	695837831470653440	2016-02-06T05:14:01	Jesse_Livermore diff is the "multiple" that households put on such savings; wages (rightly) seen as recurring vs gas as of unknown duration

SmallCapLS	689063802294407168	2016-01-18T12:36:27	TheStalwart less than you'd think; DAX components disproportionately exposed to China; many were cautious on that basis independent of QE.
SmallCapLS	688852878765768704	2016-01-17T22:38:19	Jesse_Livermore disagree - energy yes, but for many/most in the permabear complex, China (and commods) been ground zero (albeit for 3+ yrs)
