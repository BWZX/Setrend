stevesi	704128746672918528	2016-02-29T02:19:09	BlairReeves Doing new for old is how incumbents "package" v innovate. eg, Windows on WWW‚Äîused by existing Windows Svr Cust, not Internet.

stevesi	704126577831837696	2016-02-29T02:10:32	rezendi Plausible but just not historically so if innovation refers to new approaches and markets v. innovation where they won already.
