dansinker	723559768963473409	2016-04-22T17:11:06	NekoCase robertloerzel because like, *control over his art* feels as much a part of his legacy as the music itself and yikes......
dansinker	723557820264669184	2016-04-22T17:03:22	robertloerzel NekoCase bigger Q to me, tho just as grim: who controls his library/copyright/etc? does he even *have* kin?

dansinker	723314225339240448	2016-04-22T00:55:24	God, the snare sound Prince got on Get Off is still one of my favorites.
dansinker	723303028753870850	2016-04-22T00:10:55	Love of his music? Transcended boundaries, the DEPTH of his skill was a FUNDAMENT to modern music but he was Aa MIDWESTERN. BLACK. MAN.
dansinker	723302765250895872	2016-04-22T00:09:52	No.  Before anybody even starts. prince was a black artist. HE was an immaculate genius nurtured in MIDWESTERN BLACKNESS
dansinker	723304385439141888	2016-04-22T00:16:18	How are all of you doing non-prince-mourning stuff? Seems impossible.
dansinker	723270627868581888	2016-04-21T22:02:10	I never felt like I fit in. I still don't.  Prince was the first artist I encountered who was like "Me neither. Look how AMAZING that is."
dansinker	723265062090076160	2016-04-21T21:40:03	Jesus, we're like 8 months from living in a world where the Obamas aren't in the White House and Prince is dead.  
dansinker	723264351784706048	2016-04-21T21:37:13	I've been a parent for 10 years. Turns out the hardest thing about being a parent is not being a complete useless mess the day Prince dies.

dansinker	723228224935731200	2016-04-21T19:13:40	One thing though, we were fucking lucky to live in the time of Prince. Of all the places to be and the times to live.

dansinker	723203244499980289	2016-04-21T17:34:24	When I was young I went to MPLS. Prince had just opened Glam Slam. Spray paint along the alley wall read "What I did on my summer vacation"
dansinker	723199422176198657	2016-04-21T17:19:13	Jesus christ. Thank you Prince.
dansinker	723199412554461185	2016-04-21T17:19:11	This wasn't music that I listened to *at one point*, but music that was always there. Always helping, the way the best music does.
dansinker	723199370468843521	2016-04-21T17:19:00	There's never been any nostalgia associated with his music for me. It's not a celebration of life *then* but of life, period.
dansinker	723199355134468096	2016-04-21T17:18:57	I don't think there's a single artist that walked with me from my childhood into adulthood so completely the way Prince did.
dansinker	723197960360722432	2016-04-21T17:13:24	How do you mourn the sound of life? How do you do it? How do you turn on music and not hear him everywhere RIPPrince

dansinker	723192517068509184	2016-04-21T16:51:46	I always assumed that it'd be discovered that we were all just a figment inside Prince's head before it'd be discovered that he was *mortal*
