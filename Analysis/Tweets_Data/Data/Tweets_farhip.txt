farhip	719185969669414912	2016-04-10T15:31:11	Once again: People blame media for excessive Trump coverage. But Sanders has succeeded w/o it. Maybe amount of media isn't relevant factor.

farhip	714153205735641088	2016-03-27T18:12:47	Helzbaby NoahCRothman And not sure it matters either way. He's raising this to highlight Trump's oppo to Muslim immigration.
farhip	714152413381283840	2016-03-27T18:09:38	He said "uncontrolled migration." Twice.  
farhip	714149432472637441	2016-03-27T17:57:47	Pretty shocking stat, whether you distort immigration circumstances surrounding it or not.  
farhip	714147288919060480	2016-03-27T17:49:16	Helzbaby NoahCRothman So stat is accurate, according to CDC study. But not clear CDC tied this to illegal immigration, as Trump guy did.
farhip	714141853503897600	2016-03-27T17:27:40	farhip NoahCRothman CNN Here is the reporting Trump advisor was referencing: 
farhip	714132550713610240	2016-03-27T16:50:42	Trump aide w/genital mutilation comment, btw,  was Stephen Miller.

farhip	714125132457971712	2016-03-27T16:21:14	Yes, true. I'm betting that social media feeds tend to be self-reinforcing--you folo/friend people who think like U. 
farhip	714119850633912320	2016-03-27T16:00:14	But news they get on social media tends to come from MSM. Not always but lots. It's just filtered by "friends" now.

farhip	714118143971627008	2016-03-27T15:53:27	andrewmseaman stevebuttry brianstelter People mistrust press in abstract (like Congress). They like THEIR media outlet, not other guy's.

farhip	714115352058281984	2016-03-27T15:42:22	.brianstelter Also have to look at nature of massive Trump coverage: It has been overwhelmingly negative. Hasn't mattered.
farhip	714113417338966017	2016-03-27T15:34:40	hunterswilliams Not really true until later in campaign.
farhip	714111643307917314	2016-03-27T15:27:37	.brianstelter So Bernie does well w/out media coverage and Trump does well w/tons of it. Maybe the q is: Does the media matter at all?
farhip	713780402310131713	2016-03-26T17:31:23	sarahmccammon Thanks for the dialogue!
farhip	713770379047800832	2016-03-26T16:51:34	sarahmccammon Kind of a sweeping generalization, don't you think? If reporters are any good they WILL reflect local sentiment.
farhip	713768921799766016	2016-03-26T16:45:46	sarahmccammon Straw man. Never said outta-town reporters know more than locals. Don't believe that's the case.
farhip	713768635525890048	2016-03-26T16:44:38	sarahmccammon Less and less true. And no more true than the readers/viewers/listeners who count on big media for information.
farhip	713768184772476928	2016-03-26T16:42:51	sarahmccammon Yes, by then he was surging. So you were certainly correct. What did you say in mid-June?
farhip	713767552711831552	2016-03-26T16:40:20	sarahmccammon People say they distrust ALL media, not just NYC/DC kind. Not sure the locals do any better.
farhip	713765649449877505	2016-03-26T16:32:46	sarahmccammon We didn't see Trump because NO ONE saw Trump, incldg people who now support him. We're not clairvoyant.
farhip	713761457876418560	2016-03-26T16:16:07	sarahmccammon Yeah, we "missed" Trump phenomenon. But everyone did--Trump had very low poll numbers at start. 
farhip	713750636588900353	2016-03-26T15:33:07	sarahmccammon What happens in DC/NYC DOES affect people across country. That's why so many journos in both places.
farhip	713743913706733568	2016-03-26T15:06:24	sarahmccammon Agree. But I don't buy idea NYC/DC reporters more out of touch w/their "community" than small-town reporters are w/theirs.
farhip	713731427884380161	2016-03-26T14:16:47	sarahmccammon Sure. But not my point. Being a reporter anywhere requires same skills and traits.
farhip	713729718009393153	2016-03-26T14:09:59	sarahmccammon Yes, regions vary. But mainstream media fairly similar everywhere you go.
farhip	713570920049328128	2016-03-26T03:38:59	sarahmccammon ggreenwald Possibly. But do journos in, say, St. Louis or Omaha really think much differently than those in DC or NYC?
farhip	713456541282799618	2016-03-25T20:04:29	strobist No need to wait. Cruz gave everyone a reason to cover it when he spoke about it at at a campaign stop. 
farhip	713452405673877504	2016-03-25T19:48:03	strobist How about doing some independent reporting? And how about not accusing someone of something without said reporting?
farhip	713417325488242688	2016-03-25T17:28:39	The hazards of live TV: I'm guessing CNN would prefer to have reported out Nat'l Enquirer tedcruz story than have a talking head spill it.
farhip	713361799706320904	2016-03-25T13:48:01	I've now read three articles on realDonaldTrump's threat to "spill the beans" on Mrs. Cruz. None has mentioned what the beans are. Lima?

farhip	713224194679504896	2016-03-25T04:41:13	NormanCharles88 Yes, but I'm talking about an American-made show that builds in foreign-language dialogue, not a non-domestic production.
farhip	713222024806723585	2016-03-25T04:32:36	"The Americans" may be the only TV series that trusts its viewers to read extended subtitles (of Russian dialogue no less).
