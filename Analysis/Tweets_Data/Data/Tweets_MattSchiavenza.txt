MattSchiavenza	685123793631723522	2016-01-07T15:40:16	Another failed attempt to explain how Trump is going to lose. It's ok to say we don't know what's going to happen! 
MattSchiavenza	685113252385263616	2016-01-07T14:58:22	Any trader, analyst, journalist, etc who cites the Chinese stock market as reason for Dow fall is ignorant of anything having to do w/ China

MattSchiavenza	684816800480112640	2016-01-06T19:20:23	MikeBertels Ha! Was thinking about that too.
MattSchiavenza	684815523415257088	2016-01-06T19:15:18	MikeBertels Yes, but only to a point. Gambling on a game whose outcome you have a role in crosses a line, I think, that PED use doesn't
MattSchiavenza	684815269219438596	2016-01-06T19:14:18	MikeBertels The problem with the stupidly-named "character clause" is that it opens a whole can of worms. Should racist Ty Cobb be in? Etc.
MattSchiavenza	684815142379483137	2016-01-06T19:13:47	MikeBertels And I say that as someone who supports Rose's inclusion. I do think his ban is appropriate, though. The HOF is a history museum
MattSchiavenza	684815001299906562	2016-01-06T19:13:14	MikeBertels I'd argue that Rose's gambling challenged the basic integrity of the game far more than PED use did.
MattSchiavenza	684813278841802753	2016-01-06T19:06:23	MikeBertels Does he, though? He's pretty unequivocal about Bonds' merit, but he does acknowledge the steroid issue
