trdraaron	717732103610208256	2016-04-06T15:14:02	There were tons more opportunities to put that trade on in a safer position.
trdraaron	717731785946169345	2016-04-06T15:12:47	So I had jkq fly on in size, got blown out of it, then it worked big time. Studying that and learnin my lessons.

trdraaron	714907449363292160	2016-03-29T20:09:52	and this is why I don't order shrimp unless I'm at the dock. Steak please.

trdraaron	714829108643913730	2016-03-29T14:58:35	And when I see cows that cost $600-$1000 when calves were $700-$900 I think why do I want to buy these $2,000 rebreed b.s. cows.
trdraaron	714828882537373697	2016-03-29T14:57:41	Thinking about cows yesterday at the ranch, I'm down to my smallest herd size in several years, lack of cows to buy, high prices does that.
trdraaron	714815223232761856	2016-03-29T14:03:24	I don't know how people bought cattle before the days of 'war rooms'.
trdraaron	714814527963996165	2016-03-29T14:00:38	JFryer_MT I'm just glad I'm not trying to buy any grass cattle I guess. and there are almost no cows to buy.

trdraaron	714812215350599680	2016-03-29T13:51:27	JFryer_MT personally I'm getting ready to go from 1400# fats to 11-1250# fats.

trdraaron	714477650354409473	2016-03-28T15:42:00	btenharmsel1 yep, it's really helped me a lot to see that. So I buy cattle that I can do something with and ignore the predictors.
trdraaron	714477268618248192	2016-03-28T15:40:29	although last year everyone wanted cattle that would be fat in V and look what that got them. Basically no one knows anything.
trdraaron	714477166390435841	2016-03-28T15:40:05	There's probably some degree of information contained in the fact that feeders are nearer their cheapest value rather than highest in spring
trdraaron	714465055304093696	2016-03-28T14:51:57	tradellt let me guess, when they are cheaper no one wants them.

trdraaron	713052151245766656	2016-03-24T17:17:35	the way live vs feeders is working off overbought makes me think we see cheaper feeders yet to come.

trdraaron	713037399438143488	2016-03-24T16:18:58	No need to feed cattle. Just buy the huge breaks and hold until delivery.
trdraaron	713028408704237569	2016-03-24T15:43:14	So feeders were highest when the wheat run was at its max, ha. Supply = higher prices.
trdraaron	713028129028091905	2016-03-24T15:42:08	Oh, I'm wanting to buy more feeder heifers, yes really.
trdraaron	713015021228326912	2016-03-24T14:50:02	Was assigned some calls on SBY  and at a $22 NAV per share, I guess I could have worse investments, but market seems to hate this sfr reit.
trdraaron	713013656238227457	2016-03-24T14:44:37	if you wanted to buy feeders yesterday, well, they are actually cheaper today and instead of going down have been going up. fwiw, prbly not.

trdraaron	712824491810762752	2016-03-24T02:12:57	So I've lost a good bit of money this week which always makes one reassess the way they did and do things.

trdraaron	712724063110569984	2016-03-23T19:33:53	Let me guess, neither bulls nor bears in cattle have really made many money the last month. Or is that just me?
trdraaron	712691972276772864	2016-03-23T17:26:22	meatidea July perhaps. All those 1,000# feeders.
trdraaron	712669535891955712	2016-03-23T15:57:12	gfj now back near cheapest levels of the day but not nearly as cheap as yesterday.
trdraaron	712662781640753152	2016-03-23T15:30:22	By my math x bred cattle that are bought wisely have very little downside vs. live cattle levels here. x bred gets the advantage for yield.

trdraaron	712267450700550144	2016-03-22T13:19:28	every delivery month in feeders just look for the bull spread trade on a sell off, that seems to be the path to riches.

trdraaron	710536957206466560	2016-03-17T18:43:06	Remember the good 'ol days of a month ago? 
trdraaron	710533343352213504	2016-03-17T18:28:44	Because I live in colorado? 
trdraaron	710528749679161345	2016-03-17T18:10:29	wilhelmbrent %, no, not in this case. And what I'm saying is they paid off the loan with cash and also bought a more expensive home.
trdraaron	710523238447587328	2016-03-17T17:48:35	blakealbers 775_Cattle yeah, being born near Dow 800 and having my dad buy some savings bonds and some equities for my sister and I helped
trdraaron	710521809947394048	2016-03-17T17:42:55	They seem so polite in Pratt, wish everyone at Winters was that way.
trdraaron	710521075302445057	2016-03-17T17:39:59	775_Cattle I would have but that's me.
trdraaron	710520747899260928	2016-03-17T17:38:41	Just talked to a person who paid off their student loan and took on larger mortgage. Credit rearrangement and credit expansion FTW.

trdraaron	710519814641438720	2016-03-17T17:34:59	bought lev and then gfj at the previously mentioned areas.
trdraaron	710518285817618432	2016-03-17T17:28:54	jsbuyem shaking them off.
trdraaron	710512235051819008	2016-03-17T17:04:52	jsbuyem if we are all so bullish then v cattle look like buy for now until then.

trdraaron	710508300031303680	2016-03-17T16:49:13	btenharmsel1 hey I didn't draw any lines on it.
trdraaron	710507069976092673	2016-03-17T16:44:20	lev16 backing in right to composite profile value, if you are a bull you buy this I would suppose.
trdraaron	710506402091917312	2016-03-17T16:41:41	tradellt meatidea extra roast beef!
trdraaron	710506028316557312	2016-03-17T16:40:12	tradellt meatidea it worked.
trdraaron	710505939544072192	2016-03-17T16:39:51	if wanting to buy gfj, 165.30, 164.70-80.
trdraaron	710494490629443584	2016-03-17T15:54:21	I find myself wearing orange on St. Patrick's Day.
trdraaron	710490065483517953	2016-03-17T15:36:46	so the selling attempt into yesterday range in j feeders didn't work.
trdraaron	710489799212273664	2016-03-17T15:35:43	tradellt I could get you 5 acres of prime desert in colorado for a lot less than that.
trdraaron	710489556374700032	2016-03-17T15:34:45	meatidea shouldn't be hard to top a year ago, lots more heifers went on feed, but a year ago was pretty sparse if I remember.
trdraaron	710487623664414720	2016-03-17T15:27:04	tradellt it was 95.
trdraaron	710483129203499008	2016-03-17T15:09:12	When I buy actual feeders instead of the futures. making money but in a bad mood.
trdraaron	710482081332088836	2016-03-17T15:05:02	very interested to see what happens if it doesn't work.
trdraaron	710481849533878272	2016-03-17T15:04:07	kind of trying to get some selling generated below y'day high in j?
trdraaron	710474043539886081	2016-03-17T14:33:06	meatidea tradellt good idea, couldn't even take out yesterday's low.
trdraaron	710473215701680128	2016-03-17T14:29:49	...although a secondary lesser oversold is usually what I like to be buying.
trdraaron	710472816320126980	2016-03-17T14:28:14	taking small loss on my lev/gfk and moving on.
trdraaron	710470451810607104	2016-03-17T14:18:50	meatidea tradellt relative to j and q, no, but it is, j is the cheapest month and headed higher.
trdraaron	710460070312615936	2016-03-17T13:37:35	The best looking chart for breakout may be lev and leg7?
trdraaron	710301938835857408	2016-03-17T03:09:13	When you don't make nearly enough off your very best idea. This isn't nearly as easy as it looks on tv kids.
trdraaron	710301502171025410	2016-03-17T03:07:29	griffinmcgee yep. espresso and then water allows me to have a drink or two.
trdraaron	710219709384400896	2016-03-16T21:42:28	So what did I miss buying an assortment of 1100# Holstein steers and old rodeo cattle?
trdraaron	710152898592681984	2016-03-16T17:16:59	BradConradt meatidea maybe feeders know cash will be much higher in June. Who knows.
trdraaron	710151174222012417	2016-03-16T17:10:08	BradConradt meatidea the swap matters a lot but the good of that is gone now.
trdraaron	710151047189102592	2016-03-16T17:09:38	BradConradt I could understand it if May was cheap relative to spot fats but they aren't nearly as so now.
trdraaron	710116166920962048	2016-03-16T14:51:02	In absence of stocker futures and coming weight change to feeder futures market making in stocker-light feeders could be interesting.
trdraaron	710108340379058177	2016-03-16T14:19:56	tradellt 775_Cattle q has buyers today so far, gobbling up offers off the initial high.
trdraaron	710106321958408194	2016-03-16T14:11:54	buying lev and selling gfk vs. value of the low day to find out.
trdraaron	710100533860765696	2016-03-16T13:48:54	glenkottke I didn't play this at all but was watching your tweets, thought it was good theme.
trdraaron	709940255764258816	2016-03-16T03:12:01	tradellt The Shrine &gt; MSG but NYC &gt; LA, maybe.

trdraaron	709876622229262337	2016-03-15T22:59:10	snarkosaurous don't they make Hondas there and grow corn?
trdraaron	709874046960205824	2016-03-15T22:48:56	PatWagoner the only bullish case is they were hated on with a flat back month curve for so long.
trdraaron	709868980354162688	2016-03-15T22:28:48	jsbuyem K about cleaned me out last year, revenge never works.
trdraaron	709867872646877184	2016-03-15T22:24:24	jsbuyem excellent.
trdraaron	709866273249734657	2016-03-15T22:18:02	meatidea I mean the market bulling K, against me.
trdraaron	709866018915528704	2016-03-15T22:17:02	Bulling K feeders like this against gfj/q and v cattle is confusing and it's costing me a lot of money.
trdraaron	709780096849022976	2016-03-15T16:35:36	back months working their way almost through what I think had to have been a lot of prior sales and hedges.
trdraaron	709778145256144896	2016-03-15T16:27:51	Only $45 away from $120 feeders.
trdraaron	709776072649220096	2016-03-15T16:19:37	trdraaron meatidea tradellt high being cheaper.
trdraaron	709776000163287044	2016-03-15T16:19:20	meatidea tradellt yes, from opening high working their way back towards more expensive.
trdraaron	709775448390000642	2016-03-15T16:17:08	tradellt yeah I didn't do a very good job of catching all that.
trdraaron	709775013038043136	2016-03-15T16:15:24	Searched my tweets for 'feeders' and 'cheap'.
trdraaron	709774405807636480	2016-03-15T16:12:59	meatidea long live the screen.
trdraaron	709774300081881089	2016-03-15T16:12:34	meatidea yeah, yeah, that's all you, I'm trying to fight my way out of wet paper bag known as jkq fly.
trdraaron	709773991360143364	2016-03-15T16:11:21	meatidea another $2 higher to balance it.
trdraaron	709772541569552384	2016-03-15T16:05:35	good thing I have the actual cattle because my swap into these feeder spreads has halted my p&amp;l dead in its tracks.
trdraaron	709763386989350912	2016-03-15T15:29:12	Now that I get to sell &gt; 124 in q I kind of don't want to.
trdraaron	709757658576781312	2016-03-15T15:06:27	And I'd like to think the 132-3 target in M is a valid one.
trdraaron	709757502926274560	2016-03-15T15:05:50	...just when everyone thought they had to hit April.
trdraaron	709757445371863041	2016-03-15T15:05:36	At 129 M there is some real incentive to feed the cattle to their full potential and push them out to summer.
trdraaron	709756990222774273	2016-03-15T15:03:47	Drove by house for sale, scraping and painting still, just made me notice everything that looked really old about the outside (built 1903).
trdraaron	709753796784599040	2016-03-15T14:51:06	About have sorted up all the cattle that can be sold until early April. Lots of black and white cattle shipping.
trdraaron	709753146407391233	2016-03-15T14:48:31	I need to hate being in losing trades more, even if they are put on with multi-month time frame. Sitting in dead money k-q short and flys.
trdraaron	709744033153744897	2016-03-15T14:12:18	meatidea I'm all in spreads and such at the moment and needing trend day down in them.

trdraaron	709733731779551232	2016-03-15T13:31:22	silagechopper I envision a series of letters headed your way.
trdraaron	709430866926129154	2016-03-14T17:27:53	Anyone been keeping track of steer and heifer yield, looks low for  Friday summaries.
trdraaron	709420299196833792	2016-03-14T16:45:54	Do we have formula heifer data for Friday yet?
trdraaron	709416172253356032	2016-03-14T16:29:30	tradellt wish we could say the same about k-q.
trdraaron	709408473629401088	2016-03-14T15:58:54	Anyway, if you are a K feeder bear on relative basis 2014, 2010, 2007 seem to be our pattern. 2006 too if you move time frames forward.
trdraaron	709403047877746689	2016-03-14T15:37:21	doubleon100 I'd call this a position, a few weeks to month or two, but initially not working which has me thinking I'm wrong.
