anildash	726232371570298880	2016-04-30T02:11:04	jwishert the law does not require kicking Sikhs off planes for no reason. It's just something white people want.

anildash	725667102829502464	2016-04-28T12:44:54	_matt_elkin similarly, leading with the bass in Sign O The Times leads us into feeling like the arrangement is a lot fuller than it is.
anildash	725658711310655488	2016-04-28T12:11:33	_matt_elkin jonrosenberg sparseness of many of his arrangements was, as he put it, because "funk is about the space between the notes".

anildash	725536240204959744	2016-04-28T04:04:54	bradsucks one of my favorites of his, ever. Made me really wake up to how good he still was.

anildash	725160523743039489	2016-04-27T03:11:56	The death penalty is wrong, it's immoral, and it is unfathomable to me that its advocates aren't even bothered by killing the wrong person.

anildash	725124081222320128	2016-04-27T00:47:07	Eventually it came out as the Purple Medley, but the long version was only 11 minutes. I felt robbed! 
anildash	725123726690365442	2016-04-27T00:45:43	They said there would be a 3-minute medley of Prince songs at the AMAs, &amp; Warner was gonna put it out as a single with a 14-minute version.
anildash	725123322317541377	2016-04-27T00:44:06	By 95, Paisley Park reps were routinely in the chats &amp; would share info like the then-upcoming Prince tribute at the American Music Awards.
anildash	725122594840662016	2016-04-27T00:41:13	As a consequence, Paisley Park had a very good website decades ago. Many of those former Prince staffers still have technical roles in MN.
anildash	725122142489206785	2016-04-27T00:39:25	But people at Paisley Park were always very connected; some started Bitstream, one of the first BBSes in MPLS, later an early local ISP.
anildash	725121891627864064	2016-04-27T00:38:25	Must have been right around when this anecdote takes place! 
anildash	725121626862456832	2016-04-27T00:37:22	It was the talk of the AOL chat rooms that fans were hanging out in; later that year someone from Paisley Park started joining the chats.
anildash	725121125215289344	2016-04-27T00:35:23	I still remember very distinctly when us fans found that patent filing, on a text-based patent lookup system that somebody had access to.

anildash	724369436820549632	2016-04-24T22:48:26	Because the truth is Prince truly changed Erica's life with just a few words of support.  
anildash	724368567026761728	2016-04-24T22:44:59	Erica was so proud of those few, fun lines because she felt it humanized 1 of her favorite artists. Shows what a great spirit she was, too.

anildash	724128403843125248	2016-04-24T06:50:39	djbrainchild now I‚Äôm looking at all the Prince songs sorted reverse by play count. It‚Äôs some TC Ellis up in here.
anildash	724126682706264064	2016-04-24T06:43:49	djbrainchild Yeah, but given that this was intentionally a novelty song, I don‚Äôt think it counts as terrible on its face.
anildash	724125768658370561	2016-04-24T06:40:11	djbrainchild Oh I really loved some parts of it. When Koppelman was in NYC a while back we got dinner &amp; talked about that a lot.
anildash	724124735857168384	2016-04-24T06:36:05	djbrainchild And I was still such a stan back then, that when he said SHE IS INEVITABLE, I thought ‚Äúsounds legit.‚Äù Then I got home.
anildash	724124605468659712	2016-04-24T06:35:34	djbrainchild so, I got the CD, was listening to it on a friend‚Äôs shitty car stereo, and kinda couldn‚Äôt place it as Adore. I was just ü§î
anildash	724124228279275520	2016-04-24T06:34:04	djbrainchild Paris 8675309 kinda goes, too.
anildash	724124152286855168	2016-04-24T06:33:46	djbrainchild I mean, it‚Äôs seriously in the running for his worst lyrics ever. Also I felt guilty that the musical track kind of works.
anildash	724124024612204544	2016-04-24T06:33:15	djbrainchild so help me, istened to 1 of the UNRELEASED MIXES of All That. Literally no great artist has ever desecrated their own work so.
anildash	724123687272763392	2016-04-24T06:31:55	djbrainchild ask Powerline.
anildash	724123132563472384	2016-04-24T06:29:43	djbrainchild alright, when we all get drinks, we‚Äôre gonna make the definitive Worst Songs List.
anildash	724122800374595584	2016-04-24T06:28:23	djbrainchild was just the typical stuff for the era, the alt version just has fewer layers of crap in the mix. endorphincowbell
anildash	724122515421966336	2016-04-24T06:27:15	I think it‚Äôs such a favorite because it‚Äôs the height of Prince‚Äôs absurdity combined with such earnest lyrics. 
anildash	724122111820869632	2016-04-24T06:25:39	djbrainchild I had it on shuffle and apparently I have some alternate (or earlier) mix of it in the collection? It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ amazing.
anildash	724121561905672192	2016-04-24T06:23:28	djbrainchild I am so glad the deal was announced before, because if I heard about it now, I 100% would not have believed he was doing it.
anildash	724121426857472000	2016-04-24T06:22:56	One of the best performances of one of my very favorite Prince songs: ‚ÄúDolphin‚Äù on Letterman, 1994.  üíú maytegarcia

anildash	724120567331336192	2016-04-24T06:19:31	djbrainchild one of the versions of ‚ÄúRight The Wrong‚Äù came up on shuffle, and it was the first dark laugh I‚Äôve had since Thursday.

anildash	724112532617736192	2016-04-24T05:47:35	petegaines good! great. Let‚Äôs ask our mutual friends which of us is acting reasonable here, and listen to what they have to say. Shall we?

anildash	724111990642364417	2016-04-24T05:45:26	petegaines you sought me out, followed me, then replied to me being an aggressive ass, and then you want to pretend I‚Äôm the one acting odd?
anildash	724111688790872064	2016-04-24T05:44:14	petegaines Let‚Äôs say that‚Äôs 100% the case. Why on earth would you follow me on Twitter?
anildash	724111106839592960	2016-04-24T05:41:55	petegaines like, chats that folks had on Instant Messenger with Prince 15 years ago, is that part of this? HOW DEEP DOES IT GO?
anildash	724110739154321408	2016-04-24T05:40:28	petegaines then you think me and many others constructed a long con over several years to _pretend_ that Prince DMed folks? That‚Äôs the bet?
anildash	724109632415916032	2016-04-24T05:36:04	petegaines best case is you simply didn‚Äôt know that he engaged with fans all the time &amp; are mad about that. Is that it?
anildash	724108159770611712	2016-04-24T05:30:13	petegaines kevinbsmith_ then you‚Äôre just upset he made jokes with fans? Like, I get that you‚Äôre performing for your Twitter clique, but‚Ä¶?
anildash	724107681292795904	2016-04-24T05:28:19	petegaines kevinbsmith_ The whole point is that he talked to a lot of us, which was awesome. I‚Äôm not sure why you are so upset about it.
anildash	724107413574565888	2016-04-24T05:27:15	petegaines kevinbsmith_ no, you can‚Äôt delete DMs, but Prince deleted tweets all the time, talking to literally hundreds of fans.
anildash	724105295492964352	2016-04-24T05:18:50	dbrauer sure, yep. The bit‚Äôs overall structure just sucks.
anildash	724105096531832833	2016-04-24T05:18:02	petegaines Why on earth would you follow me on Twitter if you don't like hearing somebody talk about Prince? Seems odd.

anildash	724045911526125568	2016-04-24T01:22:52	initial reaction was very negative, since it included a cover. I suggested he didn't need to ask permission, but‚Ä¶ 
anildash	724045152747180032	2016-04-24T01:19:51	A few weeks ago I asked if Prince could release his wonderful medley of Marley's "Waiting In Vain" and his own "If I Was Your Girlfriend"‚Ä¶
anildash	724044817534169088	2016-04-24T01:18:31	Other striking thing? *Lots* of covers. Stands out, given Prince's ambivalence about cover versions, despite the fact he often played them.
anildash	724044168637632512	2016-04-24T01:15:56	And of course Prince's taste is impeccable; stuff like "Push Me Away" is true a Jacksons fan's pick, one of Michael's best vocals ever.

anildash	723984775510392832	2016-04-23T21:19:56	It's far more poignant now because it nods toward both his son (who had neither been born nor died yet) as well as rumors of Prince's death.
anildash	723984451202588673	2016-04-23T21:18:38	It's probably nobody's favorite Prince song, but I always loved it for acknowledging how his fans used to hang out online in the early 90s.

anildash	723576965765144576	2016-04-22T18:19:26	YeaYouRite but like, if anybody wrote substantively about his work over a decade or two, they'd hear from him.
anildash	723576778426580993	2016-04-22T18:18:42	YeaYouRite there were other, more substantive chats, via email and other forms over the years. I'm not pretending we were friends.
anildash	723576451115683840	2016-04-22T18:17:24	Almost all of Prince's giving was very community focused and grassroots. Even the show where Purple Rain was recorded was for local charity.

anildash	723574114733162496	2016-04-22T18:08:06	YeaYouRite (I think because he knew word would get out of who made a song) 
anildash	723573862160584706	2016-04-22T18:07:06	YeaYouRite he'd answer with the guys' names.

anildash	723375080982487040	2016-04-22T04:57:13	merrittkopas lil_mermaid I am standing 3 feet from Quest while he spins absurdly obscure songs. All is well. üíú
anildash	723374700118691841	2016-04-22T04:55:42	lippemfg yeah. There are more than that!
anildash	723374525379833856	2016-04-22T04:55:01	Anyway, when some academic institution makes an archive, I'm happy to donate what I've got. 
anildash	723374172861145089	2016-04-22T04:53:37	In many ways, it mirrors how Prince was about unreleased songs. He'd expect fans to know lyrics while also saying he didn't want them out.
anildash	723373793385697280	2016-04-22T04:52:06	And most of the fan sites that fans use to organize this stuff have been offline from the traffic today. :( I guess it can wait.
anildash	723373471686762497	2016-04-22T04:50:49	There's lots of funny stuff, but also thoughtful things about issues like intellectual property. Can't decide if I should share excerpts.
anildash	723373209756659713	2016-04-22T04:49:47	This is nerdy, but I had a little script that archived all the silly stuff Prince deleted from his social media accounts. (I know, I know.üò¨)
anildash	723331406345211905	2016-04-22T02:03:40	RIPPrince. The world Tweeted over 6M times today paying tribute to the music legend. A visualization of the Tweets:

anildash	723364852903763968	2016-04-22T04:16:35	mudaba fortunately prince taught me some great lessons. :) 
anildash	642827456047546368	2015-09-12T22:29:43	One thing I learned from Prince is that it‚Äôs possible to love yourself so much that everybody else does too. - anildash
anildash	723209298109591552	2016-04-21T17:58:27	I feel like the universe is telling all of us to be a lot more fearless and a lot more loving.

anildash	723352161728516099	2016-04-22T03:26:09	Also I think checking in w/ questlove made it really real that Prince is gone. But at least that damn Finding Nemo DVD is back. :)
anildash	723349579224219649	2016-04-22T03:15:53	(If you're at brooklynbowl for questlove, say hi!) üíú
anildash	723324509290254336	2016-04-22T01:36:16	anildash Adore. The notion that LOVE was too weak. That there is a word that surpasses love to express that very emotion.
anildash	723321488326184961	2016-04-22T01:24:16	Of course, Prince being Prince, he immediately deleted it so it wouldn't be on the record. So many of us have these stories. We're lucky.

anildash	723320619069247492	2016-04-22T01:20:48	_steve2_ I don't know.
anildash	723320053945499648	2016-04-22T01:18:34	Prince immediately came back with a silly response, reflecting how he didn't like to dwell on the past. 
anildash	723319220298256387	2016-04-22T01:15:15	Like, back in March, it was the anniversary of Prince recording When Doves Cry &amp; I asked if he had a story about it: 
anildash	723318708677038081	2016-04-22T01:13:13	One of the things most overlooked about Prince was that he had a *great* sense of humor, even about himself. He was funny as hell.
anildash	723314089666203648	2016-04-22T00:54:52	magicbeans mathowie yeah, his estate. May be that his sister is executor, not sure.

anildash	723286260324904960	2016-04-21T23:04:17	Reminds me of another of the many crazy stories I‚Äôve heard over the years, Prince asked Google if they‚Äôd turn their homepage purple for him.
anildash	723285962499997701	2016-04-21T23:03:06	I don‚Äôt have much patience for most of the brands capitalizing on Prince‚Äôs death, but the Google doodle today is tasteful and sweet.

anildash	723250888266100740	2016-04-21T20:43:43	Okay, I want to emphasize one thing: Prince died owning his master recordings. He fought the entire industry for control. And PRINCE WON.

anildash	723221165590888452	2016-04-21T18:45:37	I think Prince spent so much time &amp; energy insisting he was ageless and immortal that maybe I bought it a little bit. I grieve over that.

anildash	723220556343066624	2016-04-21T18:43:12	The answer was short but sweet! I emailed some questions, but after a few weeks he politely declined to answer. 
anildash	723220360175456257	2016-04-21T18:42:25	Last year, I asked Prince if he would talk to me about his adoption of tech. I couldn‚Äôt believe he replied.

anildash	723215658884980736	2016-04-21T18:23:44	Just as importantly, a global fan community knit itself together around Prince, especially since his embrace of the Internet.
anildash	723215396317368320	2016-04-21T18:22:41	And a countless number of incredible artists got a boost in their careers through working w/ Prince. (Alongside, yes, some ridiculous ones.)
anildash	723214898919026688	2016-04-21T18:20:43	For the last few years of his life, Prince overwhelmingly used his platform to help promote the work of women, especially women of color.
anildash	723214671671627776	2016-04-21T18:19:49	It‚Äôs not just that today‚Äôs songs sound like Prince songs. Production works in ways he pioneered. Distribution happens as he predicted.
anildash	723206892382769152	2016-04-21T17:48:54	Prince's music transcended and remade genres like funk, rock and R&amp;B for decades

anildash	723211725110185984	2016-04-21T18:08:06	Prince dedicated this tour to his father, but I felt this may have been just as dedicated to the son he lost 20 years ago. It haunts me.
anildash	723211120425746433	2016-04-21T18:05:42	I think about Purple Rain a lot; not even my favorite Prince song but since I wrote this it‚Äôs been stuck in my head: 
anildash	723210564722384898	2016-04-21T18:03:29	He was still just mourning the passing of Denise Matthews (Vanity), and this was a song he‚Äôd played for 33 years but it still sounded new.
anildash	723210145300393985	2016-04-21T18:01:49	He never really sings a full verse, he never plays the guitar solo, he never fully gives the audience the cue to sing along with him.
anildash	723209934603718656	2016-04-21T18:00:59	I was out for a walk when I heard this version for the first time, and it took my breath away. I teared up, right on the sidewalk. Amazing.
anildash	723209732299853824	2016-04-21T18:00:11	2 months ago, Prince played ‚ÄúPurple Rain‚Äù in a new way, just on piano, like he was writing it for the first time:

anildash	723207623840030720	2016-04-21T17:51:48	‚ÄúCan U make it rain harder?‚Äù 
anildash	723206586143899649	2016-04-21T17:47:41	I'm gonna take some time to write a bit more &amp; to just be very, very sad. (Media folks, just email me anil@dashes.com please.)
anildash	723205636872228864	2016-04-21T17:43:54	If you look at the last 30 years of pop music, you will hear Prince's sound at the top of the charts, either by his own work or others'.
anildash	723204563155574784	2016-04-21T17:39:39	At the same time, I think the "magical music elf" image of Prince (that he sometimes contributed to) undersells just how *important* he was.
anildash	723204412248739840	2016-04-21T17:39:03	I don't idealize Prince. I think he was sometimes callous, even needlessly hurtful, to people in his life. I don't diminish or ignore that.
anildash	723203797946789888	2016-04-21T17:36:36	For most of us that take Prince's work very seriously, it's a lens on the _rest_ of culture. A filter for understanding other music &amp; art.
anildash	723203621010055169	2016-04-21T17:35:54	And that matches what so many of us hardcore fans experience: Every time we thought, "Well, he finally lost it." there was more depth.
anildash	723203407641600002	2016-04-21T17:35:03	But what better compliment could I pay than that I was most excited about his current tour. Prince had found a new emotional openness.
anildash	723203238032371715	2016-04-21T17:34:23	Because all Prince ever had to do for me, he already did. All the music I could want. I saw him live at least 15 times, each one amazing.
anildash	723202656903127047	2016-04-21T17:32:04	I never got to really talk to Prince. He DMed me a few times, but I avoided most of the chances I would have had to actually chat.
anildash	723202435687157760	2016-04-21T17:31:11	Over 40 years: 40 albums, 1000+ songs, dozens of instruments, 4 films, 3+ bands, 3 nightclubs, half a dozen websites. All from Prince.
anildash	723201299433533440	2016-04-21T17:26:40	People like to cite ‚ÄúSign O the Times‚Äù having lyrics about AIDS as Prince being political. His ENTIRE CATALOG was political‚Äîhe owned it.
anildash	723201129220284416	2016-04-21T17:26:00	Perhaps one of his best (characteristically overwrought) quotes was: ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt own your masters, then your masters own you.‚Äù Control.
anildash	723200847698649096	2016-04-21T17:24:53	It‚Äôs why so many misunderstood Prince‚Äôs relationship to the Internet, or to the music industry. He always, always optimized for _control_.
anildash	723200585508466688	2016-04-21T17:23:50	The reason 1999 sounded like nothing else on the radio is because he had one of the first Linn drum machines. Whatever it took to create.
anildash	723200133668675584	2016-04-21T17:22:02	Prince crowdfunded an album on the Internet, complete w/ Kickstarter-style late delivery to angry fans, 20 YEARS AGO. Your fave could never.
anildash	723199808874385408	2016-04-21T17:20:45	Need to learn an automated mixing console to record your own work? Need to have your own subscription website to distribute music? Done.
anildash	723199633518931969	2016-04-21T17:20:03	But it wasn‚Äôt just the instruments ‚Äî Prince would master any technology, any tool needed to craft that world all by himself.
anildash	723199428681707520	2016-04-21T17:19:14	Some of this was his genius. He truly was that musically gifted. That play-all-the-instruments stuff was real, even when he was a teenager.
anildash	723199180299182081	2016-04-21T17:18:15	But what Prince did was create a world, the one he saw in his mind and his heart, and he invited us to visit. Paisley Park is in your heart!
anildash	723198923809128448	2016-04-21T17:17:14	I mean, we all have our stories‚Ä¶ being in a small town, seeing somebody being freaky &amp; feeling like we fit in. The songs we put on mixtape.
anildash	723198620485464064	2016-04-21T17:16:02	I don‚Äôt know if I ever explained to all of you why Prince means so much to me. Can I tell you some stories? Maybe I could explain a little.
anildash	720998512855490560	2016-04-15T15:33:35	I am transformed
anildash	723197136804954112	2016-04-21T17:10:08	Goodbye, Prince. I am so thankful for all you made, and all you did, and the example and inspiration you‚Äôve been for me. I love you.
anildash	723196437115203584	2016-04-21T17:07:21	questlove I don't have any words. Still hoping against hope.
anildash	723195001665101824	2016-04-21T17:01:39	I haven‚Äôt seen an official confirmation yet, but we should know either way in a few minutes.

anildash	723191404218990593	2016-04-21T16:47:21	1000timesyes that‚Äôs a bit of an oversimplification, of course.

anildash	723172485148102656	2016-04-21T15:32:11	justinabrahms same. It's my parents &amp; the fact they bought us a computer.
anildash	723172229102604288	2016-04-21T15:31:09	norm_1142 it could be lack of effective empathy, combined with sarcastic condescension?
anildash	723171730529898497	2016-04-21T15:29:11	The other common manifestation of this smugness I see is when white liberals think only conservatives are racist. Which‚Ä¶ nope.
anildash	723171425083858944	2016-04-21T15:27:58	norm_1142 I think that's assuming liberals aren't also racist.

anildash	723170026673594368	2016-04-21T15:22:24	I only recognize liberal condescension because I didn't go to college &amp; am from a small hick town; I'd be even more guilty of it otherwise.

anildash	723149248095768576	2016-04-21T13:59:50	This sets the stage for Trump's racism (which, unlike GWB's being dumb, is actually real); liberals say what they want, he keeps advancing.
anildash	723148670166794241	2016-04-21T13:57:33	But GWB clearly decided that the "dumb" image wasn't worth refuting, when instead he could simply push his agenda.

anildash	723147785030250496	2016-04-21T13:54:02	One thing emmettrensin touched on lightly that was really key is the liberal trope that GWB is dumb. He's obviously *extremely* smart.

anildash	722491612689997825	2016-04-19T18:26:38	PWGolfer how many centuries of white supremacist terror do you think it'll take? What if they enacted slavery on a massive scale?
anildash	722490109883506689	2016-04-19T18:20:40	PWGolfer nope, he killed a federal government employee. Odd that this kind of terrorism doesn't get anyone kicked off planes.

anildash	722487607180046339	2016-04-19T18:10:43	PWGolfer i agree, we should prioritize white terrorists, since they kill more Americans than anyone, and always have.

anildash	722440804044824576	2016-04-19T15:04:44	At the moment: Random passenger: "Man flying while brown is a threat."  SouthwestAir "Okay, we will make him suffer even if it's baseless."
anildash	722441545492905984	2016-04-19T15:07:41	If baseless and paranoid suspicions of random passengers started delaying planes and everyone in them, we'd soon have a higher bar.
anildash	722441278336708608	2016-04-19T15:06:37	Instead, SouthwestAir plane‚Äîand all passengers‚Äîshould get stuck while authorities investigate and then person should be let back on plane.
anildash	722440330105262080	2016-04-19T15:02:51	If a person is "suspected" then plane should wait till issue cleared. If this hurts *everyone*, things will change.

anildash	719686224936615937	2016-04-12T00:39:01	emmettrensin anyway, I take your point. I think you understand mine.
anildash	719685896568774657	2016-04-12T00:37:43	emmettrensin jamshid sure. But most of these dudes are white, college educated writers living in Brooklyn, afaict. Not worlds away.
anildash	719684973322702849	2016-04-12T00:34:03	emmettrensin jamshid apparently not?

anildash	719672042128191488	2016-04-11T23:42:40	COSIGN absolutely fantastic demo tonight! Getting that "wow" moment from the audience is so rare.
anildash	719671922271903744	2016-04-11T23:42:11	emmettrensin there are different reasons one does so. Given that this is the result every time this happens, well‚Ä¶

anildash	719669767330729984	2016-04-11T23:33:38	emmettrensin if and when those folks start screenshotting my tweets, I'll happily point it out.
anildash	719668877374943232	2016-04-11T23:30:05	andmoreprogress I am very critical of the net effect of that generation, but happy to welcome anybody of any age who wants to help.
anildash	719668678481068032	2016-04-11T23:29:18	emmettrensin sure, it's not false modesty. I'm moderately known in tech. Translating that to "look, Hamilton‚Äîproof of malice!" is weird.

anildash	719668068142751745	2016-04-11T23:26:52	emmettrensin I don't think they're angry, I think they're simply signaling to each other who is out-group.

anildash	719665352221859840	2016-04-11T23:16:05	emmettrensin I hate "u mad bro", which was kind of my point. I see how I phrased it ambiguously, tho.
anildash	719665150052143104	2016-04-11T23:15:17	BirdG81 haha, I like that. Would be amusing but I suspect not.
anildash	719664421598064640	2016-04-11T23:12:23	Most Sanders supporters, especially the young, are right that systems are failing them. Question is how you build systems after seeing that.
anildash	719663908919881729	2016-04-11T23:10:21	Anyway, on a more positive note, I liked AnandWrites on the biggest goal: how Sanders could make a lasting movement
