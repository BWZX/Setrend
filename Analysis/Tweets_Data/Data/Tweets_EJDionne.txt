EJDionne	706840540172521472	2016-03-07T13:54:51	Worth looking at this way: Pro-Trump delegates: 382 Non- or Anti-Trump delegates: 524  
EJDionne	706835553187139584	2016-03-07T13:35:02	Thanks largely to taralazar &amp; PiBoIdMo, I get to write stories for kids! What an honor! Eye on the ball, people. 
EJDionne	706835264950276096	2016-03-07T13:33:54	Conservatives bemoan the "coarsening our culture." But the GOP campaign is reaching new lows of vulgarity. My column 
EJDionne	706697999515295744	2016-03-07T04:28:27	This is a lovely piece on the DemDebate 
EJDionne	706690759760748544	2016-03-07T03:59:41	Looking forward to chatting! Also with dorianwarren joanwalsh DavidCornDC DemDebate

EJDionne	706675378316812288	2016-03-07T02:58:34	Sanders: "My father's family was wiped out by Hitler...I know what crazy and radical and extremist politics mean." 
EJDionne	706675397975347204	2016-03-07T02:58:38	Hillary also powerful on prayer and trying to understand the will of God. Against stereotypes, DemDebate has the quiet spiritual moment.
EJDionne	706674415367401472	2016-03-07T02:54:44	Good Bernie answer on whether God matters: he turns it into a nice sermon on the Golden Rule and worrying about each other. DemDebate
EJDionne	706673863988375552	2016-03-07T02:52:33	"Donald Trump's bigotry, his bullying, his bluster is not wearing well." An understated Hillary DemDebate
EJDionne	706672166553530373	2016-03-07T02:45:48	Finally, Bernie and Hillary mention the GOPDebate. Took them way too long. DemDebate
EJDionne	706671899921657856	2016-03-07T02:44:44	Let's do it. After the last GOPDebate, many Republican rank-and-filers would welcome the change. DemDebate 
EJDionne	706669776026759170	2016-03-07T02:36:18	Did I miss it? Surprised Bernie and Hillary haven't noted the difference between DemDebate &amp; GOPdebate in tone, substance, issues raised
EJDionne	706665609711501312	2016-03-07T02:19:45	So did Pat Moynihan whose Senate seat Hillary took.  
EJDionne	706665391716610048	2016-03-07T02:18:53	Bernie is right about the problems in the welfare reform bill. I thought at the time that the right vote was no. DemDebate
EJDionne	706665057539600384	2016-03-07T02:17:33	Good report on her comments on "super predators." 
EJDionne	706662659052085248	2016-03-07T02:08:01	Yes, and this applies to them both in this case. 
EJDionne	706660857233612800	2016-03-07T02:00:52	I think Bernie lost that exchange on guns. In trying to defend his position, he sounded like he was defending gun manufacturers. DemDebate
EJDionne	706659377525030912	2016-03-07T01:54:59	Meanwhile, the GOP campaign has become the crudest, most vulgar and, well, most disgusting in our history. My column 
EJDionne	706657315005435904	2016-03-07T01:46:47	Yes, that is what it looked like to me, too. GOPDebate 
EJDionne	706656878424502273	2016-03-07T01:45:03	Ex-Im Debate: Should we help our companies against others that get government aid? Or should we oppose such subsidies as corporate welfare?
EJDionne	706656184787275776	2016-03-07T01:42:18	The vote on Ex-Im Bank is an interesting case where liberals and conservatives are split. Bernie-Hillary debate on this classic DemDebate
EJDionne	706655312942493696	2016-03-07T01:38:50	The Roll Call Hillary was referring to on the money that was going to the auto bailout. Bernie voted with most Rs. 
EJDionne	706652586674229248	2016-03-07T01:28:00	Hillary comes right back at Bernie on the auto bailout suggesting his votes against bailout money hurt Detroit car companies. DemDebate
EJDionne	706652115309998081	2016-03-07T01:26:07	Bernie goes after Hillary on NAFTA and trade. This is his ticket to ride in Michigan. DemDebate

EJDionne	706647674100043776	2016-03-07T01:08:29	Stark contrast: GOPdebate in Mich. last week had one question about the Flint water crisis. More time was spent talking about body parts.
EJDionne	706647700138127360	2016-03-07T01:08:35	While Bernie and Hillary debate.... 
EJDionne	706647396403568640	2016-03-07T01:07:22	That means a lot to me. Thanks! 
EJDionne	706647169881677824	2016-03-07T01:06:28	Amen. 
EJDionne	706646953191276544	2016-03-07T01:05:37	Smart for Hillary to say "Amen" to Bernie's statement on Flint. Then she goes strong &amp; specific: "It is raining lead in Flint" DemDebate
EJDionne	706646047070621697	2016-03-07T01:02:01	Had to send this out. You're my hero tonight! If you want to join John-here are the details:

EJDionne	706643483352674305	2016-03-07T00:51:49	A hunch: lots people I'd like to watch this will tune in the DemDebate. But please tape/TiVo it. It was a good chat 
EJDionne	706629733945978883	2016-03-06T23:57:11	Yes, and all this meant he produced instant ratings; ergo, the wall-to-wall Trump Show. 
EJDionne	706541060172939264	2016-03-06T18:04:50	Thoughtful &amp; fascinating listen: Doug Fabrizio &amp; ejdionne in conversation 2/22 on radiowest:  USIH simonschuster
EJDionne	706539109096005632	2016-03-06T17:57:05	A great chart. The question we'll long debate: Would Trump have taken off as he did without the huge media push? 
EJDionne	706535933898846209	2016-03-06T17:44:28	Knowing gap btw early, primary day voting gives valuable data on late shifts. But state of polling still a problem.

EJDionne	706324585495568385	2016-03-06T03:44:38	Another even more powerful example of the surge away from Trump and Rubio toward Cruz. A debate effect? 
EJDionne	706322376833802240	2016-03-06T03:35:52	A good example of how much ground Trump and Rubio lost between early vote and today. A Cruz surge makes LA close. 
EJDionne	706319519690727424	2016-03-06T03:24:30	SOMETHING hurt Rubio--either the way he hit Trump, or how Trump went after him, or the debate, or all of the above

EJDionne	706236359464382464	2016-03-05T21:54:03	Looks like few votes are in from the Johnson County CD (3) KC suburban areas that might be better for Rubio

EJDionne	706138116617207808	2016-03-05T15:23:41	This is very important. A lot of votes have already been cast from the time Trump when was near a peak.  
EJDionne	706131117074550784	2016-03-05T14:55:52	Enjoyed being on MSNBC this morning with the incomparable JoyAnnReid. Will be back at 4 pm as part of primaries2016 coverage.

EJDionne	705750835964342272	2016-03-04T13:44:46	I remain puzzled by the apocalyptic world view evident in our politics. We're at 4.9% unemployment with continuing job growth. It ain't '08.
EJDionne	705820993244127232	2016-03-04T18:23:32	Doesn't this contradict the idea that underlay last night's debate: that nothing good is happening in the USA?

EJDionne	701224688299544576	2016-02-21T01:59:28	Trump shows where his priorities lie: After introducing his family, his first comments are devoted to trashing pundits who doubt him.
EJDionne	701221729285214208	2016-02-21T01:47:42	Yes, he does look relieved. 
EJDionne	701221534887587840	2016-02-21T01:46:56	Whatever else is said about him, Jeb will always deserve credit for standing up stoutly and clearly against Trump's Islamophobia. Bush
EJDionne	701220875526230017	2016-02-21T01:44:19	"I congratulate my competitors who are remaining on the island." Jeb Bush
EJDionne	701220661272772608	2016-02-21T01:43:28	Jeb suspends his campaign.
EJDionne	701220332800086016	2016-02-21T01:42:10	Jeb looks better, stronger and more comfortable in this painful concession speech than he so often has looked during the campaign.
EJDionne	701218729053523969	2016-02-21T01:35:47	EJDionne The SC NIT?
EJDionne	701219149591085056	2016-02-21T01:37:27	Trump currently ahead in 7 of 11 Super Tuesday states. 
EJDionne	701218089371701248	2016-02-21T01:33:15	At the moment, Bush is only 19 votes ahead of Kasich: 22,802-22,783. SouthCarolina
EJDionne	701210775537500161	2016-02-21T01:04:11	This is an important fact. 
EJDionne	701209648498667520	2016-02-21T00:59:42	South Carolina has new voter ID law in effect. 1 of 16 states with new voting restrictions in place since 2012 
EJDionne	701209296575533056	2016-02-21T00:58:18	Good to read w/coverage of Trump win. (Yes, I'm biased.) Thanks HC_Richardson for this on Why the Right Went Wrong 
EJDionne	701202522610991113	2016-02-21T00:31:23	And NBCNews just called it for Trump. 
EJDionne	701202095257550849	2016-02-21T00:29:41	Noticed that. 
EJDionne	701179410960031744	2016-02-20T22:59:33	Been thinking this all day. Clinton camp body language was gloomy, Sanders' optimistic. Makes her good win bigger. 
EJDionne	701172533358411776	2016-02-20T22:32:13	I'd like to do a book on the Dems; appreciate your thought! But Hillary just won. Dems face problems not crackup 
EJDionne	701171708514988032	2016-02-20T22:28:57	Hey, Matt: Hillary has won Nevada. Does that change the analysis? Dems have real challenges but it's not a crack-up 
EJDionne	701170379327463424	2016-02-20T22:23:40	HillaryClinton wins Nevada caucus, says NBCNews. This is a big deal. A defeat would have led to a week of media gloom for her.
EJDionne	701156803351068672	2016-02-20T21:29:43	Love howardfineman's high end historical reference comparing Iowa Evangelicals to Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army.
EJDionne	701149519786848257	2016-02-20T21:00:46	This shouts out for some great Shakespeare quotation! 
EJDionne	701099124612005888	2016-02-20T17:40:31	Thank you Heather Cox Richardson for a v-warm, generous review (&amp; thoughtful critique) of "Why the Right Went Wrong"

EJDionne	701093473991139328	2016-02-20T17:18:04	Implicit from Weaver: Will pundits do some agonizing reappraisal if Kasich beats all the expectations in SC today? 
EJDionne	700766221080338432	2016-02-19T19:37:41	Bless you, Norm! 
EJDionne	700763385747607552	2016-02-19T19:26:25	I'm talking about "Why the Right Went Wrong" next week in Boston, Louisville, Chicago &amp; Madison. The full sked is on 
EJDionne	700719783365496832	2016-02-19T16:33:09	A virtue of all-over-the-lot polls: They mess up the expectations game, one of the most artificial &amp; misleading constructions in politics.
EJDionne	700716359227990016	2016-02-19T16:19:33	Thanks to the folks at the Philadelphia Public Library for a great event last night &amp; to the many people who came!

EJDionne	700372989762793472	2016-02-18T17:35:07	Why'd it take him three days to rise? I would have risen in three hours. Jesus, very low energy.

EJDionne	699405419152801792	2016-02-16T01:30:20	In his latest book EJDionne proves what chrislhayes is saying, which I used to deny: GOP rebellion is anti-Bush not just anti-Obama

EJDionne	699589888900001792	2016-02-16T13:43:21	A conversation, debate about my book "Why the Right Went Wrong" with Bill Kristol &amp; me today 2 pm BrookingsInst

EJDionne	699387418613428224	2016-02-16T00:18:49	Why did Trump pick a fight with W? Maybe because lifting up Jeb hurts Rubio which keeps anti-Trump opposition divided post-SouthCarolina
EJDionne	699385493499195393	2016-02-16T00:11:10	Thank you! And I hope to write an Afterword next year! 
EJDionne	699355529647247360	2016-02-15T22:12:06	Bravo, Jeff. To state this with your arch calmness is to make clear what a radical &amp; unprecedented idea this is.

EJDionne	698160391067725830	2016-02-12T15:03:03	A smart and (forgive me) fair-and-balanced take on the Hillary-Bernie debate from ThePlumLineGS 
EJDionne	697826302812909569	2016-02-11T16:55:30	The GOP Establishment is in tatters. JFK: He who foolishly rides to power on the back of the tiger ends up inside. 
EJDionne	697823685957308417	2016-02-11T16:45:06	Thank you Erik Spanberg for a very thoughtful and generous review of "Why the Right Went Wrong" in csmonitor 
EJDionne	697809306553610241	2016-02-11T15:47:58	Forgive any overkill. I did love NickKristof's column today but tweeted it twice because I forgot the crucial hashtag on Trump.
EJDionne	697807243035676672	2016-02-11T15:39:46	"The GOP created Trump." Thank you, NickKristof, for your generous comments on "Why the Right Went Wrong."

EJDionne	697581499525234693	2016-02-11T00:42:44	Gotta say I loved DouthatNYT's rollicking and thoughtful reverie on the pickle his party &amp; his movement are in.  
EJDionne	697573409044197376	2016-02-11T00:10:35	The conservatism that has dominated the GOP is in crisis. And young people aren't high on capitalism. My column: 
EJDionne	697558393821618176	2016-02-10T23:10:55	Why did Trump happen? Why are the GOP &amp; conservatism in chaos? Those questions are at the heart of my book:

EJDionne	697454236359983105	2016-02-10T16:17:02	Thanks offcentervoice!  
EJDionne	697453488121335808	2016-02-10T16:14:04	Trump, pundit, explains results in 1 sentence: "We’re being ripped off by everybody." Nice take from ThePlumLineGS 
EJDionne	697452084338135041	2016-02-10T16:08:29	Very smart from HaroldMeyerson on NH: Bernie is the first Dem insurgent to break into the white working class vote 
EJDionne	697270339127017472	2016-02-10T04:06:18	My Jan. 17 column arguing that Kasich was betting on aspiration over anger &amp; that he might be onto something. 
EJDionne	697268874970923008	2016-02-10T04:00:29	I think that is the smart bet now. 
EJDionne	697262122930049025	2016-02-10T03:33:39	Great point. Cross-over Independents helped make his showing in New Hampshire possible. 
EJDionne	697261115017809920	2016-02-10T03:29:38	The GOP race is a mess. Kasich can't play easily in South Carolina. Bush weakened, Rubio even more. Trump &amp; Cruz have best options.
EJDionne	697259070970073090	2016-02-10T03:21:31	Kasich was the foil anti-Trump voters were looking for: moderate in the face of extremism, healing rhetoric vs divisive rhetoric.
EJDionne	697258275469832192	2016-02-10T03:18:21	"We're going to solve our problems not by being extreme, not by being primarily a Republican or a Democrat, but by being Americans." Kasich
EJDionne	697257476203245568	2016-02-10T03:15:11	Preach, Liz. 
EJDionne	697255531422027776	2016-02-10T03:07:27	Trump's announced he's going to repeal Obamacare and replace it with SomethingSoTerrificYouWon'tBelieveItTrustMeOnThisCare.
EJDionne	697255067900968960	2016-02-10T03:05:37	Priceless. 
EJDionne	697254349748072450	2016-02-10T03:02:45	Most Trump sentence ever:  We're going to do something so good and so fast and so strong...believe me!
EJDionne	697254727814242304	2016-02-10T03:04:16	Trump is a nationalist. That is the core of his appeal. It's evident in where he started his speech: about trade &amp; beating our competitors
EJDionne	697253853830328320	2016-02-10T03:00:47	"I want to congratulate the other candidates." "NOW WE GOT THAT OVER WITH." Trump
EJDionne	697248090886008832	2016-02-10T02:37:53	Trump 34 Cruz 12 Rubio 10 The 3 Governors 36
EJDionne	697246925087592452	2016-02-10T02:33:15	"We will need to come together in a few months ... Because the right-wing Republicans must not be allowed to occupy the presidency." Bernie
EJDionne	697246487403749376	2016-02-10T02:31:31	...or YUGE 
EJDionne	697246547340165120	2016-02-10T02:31:45	"Democrats win when voter turnout is high. Republicans win when people are demoralized and turnout is low." Bernie's core strategic idea.
EJDionne	697246164173729792	2016-02-10T02:30:14	"Because of a huge voter turnout, and I say HUGE, we won." BernieSanders
EJDionne	697239854309122048	2016-02-10T02:05:10	As bad as Clinton did tonight in NH, she tied Sanders among self-ID'd Democrats (lost big among indies). Many future primaries are Dem-only.
EJDionne	697245307373944832	2016-02-10T02:26:50	Interesting: Both Bernie &amp; Hillary have more votes than Trump. Yes, the GOP field much bigger, but intriguing nonetheless.
EJDionne	697244793953386497	2016-02-10T02:24:47	Agree he's a conservative. But he ran an aggressively moderate campaign in New Hampshire. 
EJDionne	697244271271804928	2016-02-10T02:22:43	"It's not whether you get knocked down that matters. It's whether you get back up" The Hillary story.
EJDionne	697243699026071553	2016-02-10T02:20:26	"Do all the good you can in all the ways you can for all the people you can." Hillary channels her Methodist tradition.
EJDionne	697242850283515904	2016-02-10T02:17:04	"People have every right to be angry, but they're hungry, hungry for solutions. What can we do?" HillaryClinton's "Where's the beef?"
EJDionne	697242415749419008	2016-02-10T02:15:20	A question about this: Did more Independents pick up GOP ballots this time &amp; more Indies take Dem ballots in 08? 
EJDionne	697241515358183425	2016-02-10T02:11:46	New Hampshire Republicans' two messages:  Anger comes in first with Trump.  But the most moderate &amp; conciliatory candidate, Kasich, is #2.
EJDionne	697155988579717120	2016-02-09T20:31:54	Fourth Graders Power! (Do they speak for their parents?)

EJDionne	697049428281184256	2016-02-09T13:28:28	What's it like interviewing for a job in the White House budget office?  "So, how do you feel about Sisyphus?"

EJDionne	697044890299953152	2016-02-09T13:10:26	Thank you, John. You were excellent -- and everyone should read your book on Pope Francis &amp; American Catholicism. 
EJDionne	697043285680861184	2016-02-09T13:04:04	Kasich,Jeb close strong in NH. Cruz knows his chances of beating expectations depend on winning RandPaul votes. 
EJDionne	696844168627253248	2016-02-08T23:52:51	Thank you, Twitter friends. Yesterday's nytimes print edition: the first time I have been on its best-seller list.  
EJDionne	696715569496612864	2016-02-08T15:21:50	Christie, Kasich, Jeb=Republican Governors Against Outrageous &amp; Callow Candidates. My column: They target Rubio 
EJDionne	696515566044061696	2016-02-08T02:07:06	Was MarcoRubio too good to be true? My column: GOP Governors remind the party that this is about, well, governing. 
EJDionne	696210573009252352	2016-02-07T05:55:10	On FoxNews, brithume compares Rubio to Dan Quayle in 1988. That is really bad news for Rubio. GOPDebate
EJDionne	696185101076529153	2016-02-07T04:13:57	The fact that no question was asked nor response volunteered by presidential candidates on FlintWaterCrisis is both sad and irresponsible.
EJDionne	696180490483736583	2016-02-07T03:55:37	Yes &amp; that means Jeb, Kasich &amp; Christie achieved their objectives. Rubio needed to rally the squishes. He didn't 
EJDionne	696179568525365249	2016-02-07T03:51:58	GOPDebate impression (2): Trump and maybe Cruz helped by a weakened Rubio. Except for his close, Trump smart to hold back on attacks.
EJDionne	696179249535971328	2016-02-07T03:50:42	GOPDebate impressions (1): Rubio clear loser. Kasich, Bush helped themselves. Christie strong but his attacks may help others more...
EJDionne	696177921917112320	2016-02-07T03:45:25	Trump did fine for his constituency, then spoiled his close because he just couldn't stop himself from going after Cruz for winning Iowa
EJDionne	696177471356604416	2016-02-07T03:43:38	Good idea. 
EJDionne	696174219147808768	2016-02-07T03:30:42	It was a good answer for him until he got to the "sweet spot" part. 
EJDionne	696173185830621185	2016-02-07T03:26:36	You sent me to my dictionary, Howard.  
EJDionne	696171622831677440	2016-02-07T03:20:23	Please don't hold me against the great costareports. 
EJDionne	696170973486260224	2016-02-07T03:17:48	I have the same take on tonight 
EJDionne	696171189144784897	2016-02-07T03:18:40	Re Christie answer on women and draft: Every father of daughters -- right, left, or center -- is a feminist. GOPDebate
EJDionne	696170743424532480	2016-02-07T03:16:54	.BobShrum has an interesting take: That Trump on net a winner tonight partly because the Governors tore apart Rubio. GOPDebate
EJDionne	696169369131425794	2016-02-07T03:11:26	Very important finding.  
EJDionne	696168474922496000	2016-02-07T03:07:53	EJDionne has graciously refused to "make an issue of costareports youth and inexperience." Also GoIrish GOPDebate
EJDionne	696168597815738368	2016-02-07T03:08:22	I really like that Kasich immediately said we need a win-win on relations between the police and minority communities. GOPDebate
EJDionne	696168028514492416	2016-02-07T03:06:06	I feel exactly the same way. And Robert has a much better smile. 
EJDionne	696163960790319104	2016-02-07T02:49:57	Esto es cierto. Los gobernadores se están protegiendo para bajarse a Rubio y a Cruz. 
EJDionne	696165456164560897	2016-02-07T02:55:53	To pull down Rubio. 
EJDionne	696165230045478917	2016-02-07T02:54:59	kscincotta Glad we think alike!
EJDionne	696164873168928768	2016-02-07T02:53:34	An unusually personal answer on drug addiction from Cruz. Christie answer on definition of pro-life effective. Drugs huge issue in NH.
EJDionne	696164458331250688	2016-02-07T02:51:55	Good point. Of course the winning answer in New Hampshire is: I lost interest after the Patriots were knocked out. 
EJDionne	696163591318323200	2016-02-07T02:48:28	Anybody else have the feeling I have that Jeb, Kasich and Christie are acting more as allies tonight than adversaries?  GOPDebate
EJDionne	696163273914388481	2016-02-07T02:47:13	Jeb goes all in on states' rights. GOPDebate

EJDionne	696161076963123204	2016-02-07T02:38:29	.SteveRattner has this habit of trying to inject facts into a GOPDebate 
EJDionne	696160801921634304	2016-02-07T02:37:23	"None of us up here is a military expert." BenCarson Interesting comment on his rivals. GOPDebate
EJDionne	696159275471790085	2016-02-07T02:31:19	The myth that millionaire's tax killed NJ economy, as GovChristie says:  
EJDionne	696158530164887552	2016-02-07T02:28:22	This Twitter feed is fair and balanced. I retweet dissenters. Thanks MichaelRStrain
EJDionne	696158036994367488	2016-02-07T02:26:24	Who wants fewer millionaires?  
EJDionne	696157858077904896	2016-02-07T02:25:42	"memorized 25-second speeches prepared by his advisers".  That's going to stick unless Rubio changes  
EJDionne	696157838037684224	2016-02-07T02:25:37	A reminder from Jeb that he really is a conservative: He talks about wanting more millionaires. GOPDebate
EJDionne	696157398013186049	2016-02-07T02:23:52	Why are so many things true at the same time? 
EJDionne	696157274251927553	2016-02-07T02:23:22	Don't know if it's just me but when Rubio goes into crisp practiced answer I think of Christie point that Rubio speaks prepared soundbites
EJDionne	696156766862761987	2016-02-07T02:21:21	Two things true, I think-He was off and defensive at the beginning of his answer to Jeb. But agree donor play smart 
EJDionne	696155111970570240	2016-02-07T02:14:47	Talk times @ 1st break:  Cruz: 9:13 Rubio: 6:25 Trump: 6:14 Christie: 4:59 Bush: 3:46 Carson: 3:37 Kasich:2:57
EJDionne	696155947824189440	2016-02-07T02:18:06	I think Kasich's audience is in large part Independents ("undeclareds") whom he's trying to bring into GOP primary 
EJDionne	696155311892250625	2016-02-07T02:15:34	Kasich is doing okay when he gets time to speak. But he hasn't had many shots. His channeling compassionate conservatism just now was good.
EJDionne	696153429291487232	2016-02-07T02:08:06	Conclusions so far on GOPDebate: Both Rubio and Trump put on the defensive. Jeb as strong as he's ever been.
EJDionne	696152913425666048	2016-02-07T02:06:03	Finally Jeb gets to Trump  and hits him hard on eminent domain. GOPDebate
EJDionne	696152584487374848	2016-02-07T02:04:44	.CNN strikes back! At Cruz 
EJDionne	696152064351735808	2016-02-07T02:02:40	Exactly. 
EJDionne	696151624427810816	2016-02-07T02:00:55	Somebody must have told Ted Cruz that the buzzer means “great point, please continue."
EJDionne	696151742082371584	2016-02-07T02:01:23	EJDionne Heard him speak in person, like reading Ulysses but less interesting.  Forced to conclude his alternative to ACA is a lot like ACA
EJDionne	696151626084700164	2016-02-07T02:00:56	Cruz says socialized medicine leads to "rationing," But we ration now (and even more before O-care) because not everyone gets insurance
EJDionne	696151241693536256	2016-02-07T01:59:24	Trump strings together a words &amp; phrases but I don't know what his health plan is. Good that he doesn't want people to "die in the streets"
EJDionne	696150155163258880	2016-02-07T01:55:05	Great chart. Facts are stubborn things. GOPDebate 
EJDionne	696149804800438273	2016-02-07T01:53:41	Funny how Cruz didn't mention the number of people Barack Obama deported. Hint: it's a lot
EJDionne	696149800396439554	2016-02-07T01:53:40	Agree. So far, I don't think  Rubio has protected himself well against Kasich and Jeb. 
EJDionne	696149089726164992	2016-02-07T01:50:51	"I cannot even begin to think of taking a mom or a dad who have not committed a crime out of a house and leave their children here" Kasich
EJDionne	696148456335917056	2016-02-07T01:48:20	I agree 
EJDionne	696146753851101184	2016-02-07T01:41:34	Oh hi John Kasich!
EJDionne	696146611429371904	2016-02-07T01:41:00	Wonder if Trump is happy to see others take on Rubio. 
EJDionne	696146250928787456	2016-02-07T01:39:34	Cruz is wrong, South Korea has not said it wants the THAAD missile defense system. It's very controversial there.
EJDionne	696145929003495424	2016-02-07T01:38:17	Do you all know if Governor Kasich is at the debate?

EJDionne	696144674923397120	2016-02-07T01:33:18	Rubio: mistake going after Christie instead of talking about his record. And then he repeats himself with "a memorized 30 second speech."
EJDionne	696144277324304384	2016-02-07T01:31:44	ChrisChristie will lead the wrecking crew against Rubio. Christie may not help himself but he is doing real damage here. GOPDebate
EJDionne	696144007206932480	2016-02-07T01:30:39	As far as I can tell, MarcoRubio did not answer the question about what experience he had to be president. GOPDebate
EJDionne	696143631913197569	2016-02-07T01:29:10	That was a smart answer by Cruz on the Carson email but I am waiting for the fact-checkers. Blaming the media always plays in a GOPDebate
EJDionne	696143148276445184	2016-02-07T01:27:14	Washington ethics, says BenCarson, are: "if it's legal, you do what you need to do to win." Take that, TedCruz GOPDebate

EJDionne	695783045765427206	2016-02-06T01:36:19	At the NewHampshire Democratic Dinner, Bernie's fans shake the rafters when he's introduced. 
EJDionne	695751157260677121	2016-02-05T23:29:36	"Some of our voices are so reactionary now it looks like they've lost confidence in free market economics." Jeb NewHampshire
EJDionne	695748802792263680	2016-02-05T23:20:15	Jeb on Trump: "There are some deep insecurities going on in that guy's head." Rips Trump for insulting Muslims, Mexican-Ams., the disabled
EJDionne	695747211288772613	2016-02-05T23:13:56	Jeb asked about climatechange. "The climate is changing and man has some role in that. We deny that at our peril."

EJDionne	695742737065320448	2016-02-05T22:56:09	Jeb's first argument here comes down to: Rubio is a Republican Obama
EJDionne	695742273666031616	2016-02-05T22:54:18	Jeb says he was impressed by Obama in 08 but "there was nothing in his background that suggested leadership ability to forge consensus."
EJDionne	695739820098850817	2016-02-05T22:44:33	LindseyGraham campaigns for Jeb! "If you get Bernie Sanders, you'll get Denmark on steroids." Interesting concept 
EJDionne	695739474303676416	2016-02-05T22:43:11	Waiting for#Jeb!  Two NH thoughts: Trump could lose this one, too. And Jeb needs huge debate performance to survive 
EJDionne	695720465571168256	2016-02-05T21:27:39	Very kind of you. Thanks! My spirits are good. I just sound a bit like Bob Dylan -- alas, without his talent.

EJDionne	691404580534419456	2016-01-24T23:37:52	marybschneider I am a lucky person, I very much agree, but I am sad about this game
EJDionne	691403833537204225	2016-01-24T23:34:54	And the Patriots season comes down to one missed PAT, one field goal not taken, and a great Broncos defense. Sadness
EJDionne	691402908269608960	2016-01-24T23:31:13	For the sake of the Patriots and Gostkowski!
EJDionne	691402622830399488	2016-01-24T23:30:05	WOW! Gronk again. Patriots

EJDionne	691398580628684801	2016-01-24T23:14:01	marybschneider Appreciate the love.
EJDionne	691397871669620736	2016-01-24T23:11:12	Sure could use the 3 points from the field goal the Patriots didn't kick. Hope it doesn't matter.
EJDionne	691397589564928000	2016-01-24T23:10:05	This is the TomBrady of old! Patriots
EJDionne	691394574158180352	2016-01-24T22:58:06	The right time in the game for TomBrady to get hot. Patriots
EJDionne	691390334182363136	2016-01-24T22:41:15	First big play in a long time the Patriots D allowed. That hurt.
EJDionne	691390055932297216	2016-01-24T22:40:09	HappaWolves I try to say hopeful. But history also shows the Patriots are a good come-from-behind team. The D has to keep holding.
EJDionne	691389682806984704	2016-01-24T22:38:40	jimchap Afraid you are right. Thank God for the D. If they hang on, we need just 1 TD or 2 field goals. Gotta find a passing rhythm
EJDionne	691387589492748288	2016-01-24T22:30:21	Why not? Patriots 
EJDionne	691387195404365824	2016-01-24T22:28:47	Patriots lucky to have JamieCollins back.
EJDionne	691384518159151105	2016-01-24T22:18:09	Another big play for MalcolmButler. He is a playoff gamer. Patriots
EJDionne	691383794612334592	2016-01-24T22:15:16	Two best runs: a First Brady, now Manning!
EJDionne	691383328050524162	2016-01-24T22:13:25	jogopow I do hope you order it anyway! I have rooted for this team since they were formed. Disloyalty is not good.
EJDionne	691382257760604160	2016-01-24T22:09:10	Of a sudden (as Senator Moynihan used to say) we are looking at a classic Patriots drive.
EJDionne	691381941854040064	2016-01-24T22:07:54	mlasselin He's impressive, especially given all the physical damage.
EJDionne	691381528991911936	2016-01-24T22:06:16	Funny to hear PeytonManning singing "epic comeback starts right here" in Nationwide ad. That is the Patriots/TomBrady song right now.
EJDionne	691380957216120834	2016-01-24T22:04:00	Good: Patriots don't suffer from giving up possession at the beginning of 2 half. If Pats pull this off, their D will be huge part of story
EJDionne	691377316564484098	2016-01-24T21:49:32	Patriots got away w/a bad half only 1 score down. Their D strong except on 1st drive. They're a good 2d  half team; need pass game fixes.
EJDionne	691375605166768128	2016-01-24T21:42:44	No, we invented Patriots Day!   
EJDionne	691372993214291969	2016-01-24T21:32:21	Good for malcolmbutler! Key play. Wipes out the turnover. Patriots
EJDionne	691371896475107329	2016-01-24T21:27:59	Hate to say this about TomBrady but that throw felt ill-judged from the moment it left his hand. Any dissent? Patriots
EJDionne	691371169413492738	2016-01-24T21:25:06	The penalties are evening out. That was another big one for the Patriots.
EJDionne	691370140466843648	2016-01-24T21:21:01	The Patriots D has come together since that first drive. The other Broncos TD was on the pick.
EJDionne	691369064258801664	2016-01-24T21:16:44	Yes, especially on the run. The Patriots had trouble on that first drive. 
EJDionne	691368820754268160	2016-01-24T21:15:46	Gostkowsi is back. Like the fact that he still looks furious at himself for missing the PAT. Competitor Patriots
EJDionne	691368269077413888	2016-01-24T21:13:35	Thank you! 
EJDionne	691368190295805952	2016-01-24T21:13:16	That was an amazing fact: Brady has the longest running play of the game. Patriots
EJDionne	691367124925833216	2016-01-24T21:09:02	OK, a penalty that is hugely helpful to the Patriots.
EJDionne	691366443754110976	2016-01-24T21:06:19	This game feels worse than it is for the Patriots. After all the mistakes, it's still just a one score game.
EJDionne	691364311436914692	2016-01-24T20:57:51	Ouch! Patriots
EJDionne	691363392271953921	2016-01-24T20:54:12	dreif22 Patriots Just a question. Not a whine. Whines don't come with question marks! Hi, by the way.
EJDionne	691363039233216512	2016-01-24T20:52:48	ApplePasta Not yet. Why I posed it as a question. And the challenge ruling was huge.
EJDionne	691362721619554305	2016-01-24T20:51:32	Great momentum changing TD not an ideal time for Gostkowski to break his PAT streak. He's still great. Patriots 
EJDionne	691361254212939776	2016-01-24T20:45:42	Huge challenge win. Most Patriots fans didn't think Hochuli had it in him. 
EJDionne	691359731407949824	2016-01-24T20:39:39	Have all the penalties except the declined one been against the Patriots?
EJDionne	691358503210881024	2016-01-24T20:34:46	That was an essential stop. Then Amendola puts an exclamation point on it. Score here a momentum changer. Patriots.
EJDionne	691356861346414592	2016-01-24T20:28:15	No love for Gronk from the ref. Looked like he got a nice little hug from TJ Ward
EJDionne	691355167673847808	2016-01-24T20:21:31	Yes, exactly. 
EJDionne	691351156681871360	2016-01-24T20:05:35	What's your theory, Ben? Shock through PatriotsNation! Patriots

EJDionne	688367684468080640	2016-01-16T14:30:19	Washington Post reporter Jason Razaian and three other U.S. Prisoners freed in Iran. 
EJDionne	688108478380965891	2016-01-15T21:20:20	A very thoughtful review of my book "Why the Right Went Wrong" latimes. Thanks mbobelian for your generous words. 
EJDionne	688086566539935744	2016-01-15T19:53:16	Thank you so much Jon! You know how much such a judgement means to an author -- and, for me, especially so from you. 
EJDionne	688071266037710848	2016-01-15T18:52:28	This point NYTimeskrugman really needs to be amplified: We can have a more equal society &amp; lots of economic growth

EJDionne	688068479178510338	2016-01-15T18:41:23	.ThePlumLineGS: Last night shows most Rs have "given up on trying to resist the terms of the debate" set by Trump 
EJDionne	687863839321264129	2016-01-15T05:08:13	There's a certain logic here. 
EJDionne	687855654699184128	2016-01-15T04:35:42	GOPDebate Punditry (3): Oh, yes, and Carson probably won't be on the big stage next time.
EJDionne	687855205178724354	2016-01-15T04:33:55	GOPDebate Punditry (2): Bush &amp; Christie had moments but didn't gain much; Rubio hard to read: Fluent but very practiced, took some hits.
EJDionne	687854369992130561	2016-01-15T04:30:36	GOPDebate Punditry (1): Trump lost nothing tonight. Cruz took hits but was the central figure. Kasich gained ground...
EJDionne	687852616366198784	2016-01-15T04:23:38	Do you agree with me that Kasich may have done more than anyone to advance himself tonight? Avoided conflict, never disappeared. GOPDebate
EJDionne	687851215300902913	2016-01-15T04:18:04	That was the first clean hit by JebBush tonight. He goes after both Rubio and Cruz as  1. Senators  and  2. Flip-Floppers GOPDebate
EJDionne	687850342235504640	2016-01-15T04:14:35	Rubio bang-bang-bang attack on Cruz flip flops. Shows Rubio, like Trump, sees Cruz as the biggest threat to him.  GOPDebate
EJDionne	687848949131051008	2016-01-15T04:09:03	The GOPDebate struck me as a fine time to note that my new book "Why the Right Went Wrong" comes out next week. 
EJDionne	687847202136264705	2016-01-15T04:02:07	The NBA has had two overtime games tonight. The GOPDebate feels like it's in its third overtime.
EJDionne	687845707693207553	2016-01-15T03:56:10	Christie just treated Rubio like Trump treats Jeb
EJDionne	687845768422502400	2016-01-15T03:56:25	Republican habit: talk about deficits when they want to cut programs but never talk about deficits when they want tax cuts. GOPDebate
EJDionne	687843678157586433	2016-01-15T03:48:07	Am I wrong on this? I think Christie's idea on using tax reform one-time revenues on infrastructure is a variant on Obama idea. GOPDebate
EJDionne	687842238118805504	2016-01-15T03:42:23	Trump going after JebBush not smart. It's overkill &amp; doesn't help him. A Bush collapse would consolidate the anti-Trump vote. GOPDebate
EJDionne	687841322535751681	2016-01-15T03:38:45	Kasich talking tough trade a smart move. Rubio taking issue with him will make his donors happier than voters. GOPDebate

EJDionne	687838224211808256	2016-01-15T03:26:26	Nicely said. GOPDebate 
EJDionne	687837619309264896	2016-01-15T03:24:02	JebBush makes strong points against Trump on Muslims, then undercuts himself by politely asking Trump to "reconsider." GOPDebate
EJDionne	687835871966441473	2016-01-15T03:17:05	What's the over/under on Carson being off the main stage in the next debate? GOPDebate
EJDionne	687835001224695808	2016-01-15T03:13:38	Yes, but I also think Kasich is gaining ground among the New Hampshire voters he needs. GOPDebate 
EJDionne	687833937494708224	2016-01-15T03:09:24	Talking time in GOPDebate: 1. Cruz 2. Trump 3. Kasich 
EJDionne	687833385541234688	2016-01-15T03:07:13	I wonder if anyone had told Cruz about that Trump 9/11 answer earlier in TV intv--didn't seem ready for it
EJDionne	687833379924910080	2016-01-15T03:07:11	Good for Trump (don't say that often) for noting William F. Buckley Jr. lived in Manhattan. And he beats Cruz by recalling 9/11 GOPDebate
EJDionne	687832478644441088	2016-01-15T03:03:36	"Most people know exactly what 'New York values' are." Cruz has never been to Staten Island. GOPDebate

EJDionne	687827364462620673	2016-01-15T02:43:17	Not exactly a band of happy warriors on that debate stage, is it?
EJDionne	687828588305887232	2016-01-15T02:48:09	More Christie fact checking.  
EJDionne	687828347032698880	2016-01-15T02:47:11	I was thinking the same. (Though "chilling" is not a word I associate with Kasich.) GOPDebate 
EJDionne	687827515860099073	2016-01-15T02:43:53	One problem with Christie's answer on Justice Sotomayor: he wasn't telling the truth. GOPDebate 
EJDionne	687826587123724289	2016-01-15T02:40:12	Rubio is clearly worried about Christie in New Hampshire. Christie is winning this exchange. GOPDebate
EJDionne	687826062458273792	2016-01-15T02:38:07	So far, three candidates count in the GOPDebate: 1. Cruz 2. Trump 3. Rubio The rest are disappearing.
EJDionne	687825641152987136	2016-01-15T02:36:26	Rubio very smart to jump in to pull debate away from Cruz-Trump birther brawl. Suspect that worked with dial groups. GOPDebate
EJDionne	687825251326017537	2016-01-15T02:34:53	Cruz is trying to discredit all his critics by tying them all to the left. With the right, that often works.. GOPDebate

EJDionne	687823754643124224	2016-01-15T02:28:56	"The Constitution hasn't changed but the poll numbers have." Cruz on his own birther issue. Does Trump come back? GOPDebate
EJDionne	687820275291930624	2016-01-15T02:15:07	"Dodd-Frank" as a national security disaster issue?
EJDionne	687822604091052032	2016-01-15T02:24:22	Yes, and especially when the answers are non-responsive. GOPDebate 
EJDionne	687822349740056576	2016-01-15T02:23:21	Cruz opens &amp; closes his answer on his loans trashing the New York Times. You never go wrong on the right trashing the media. GOPDebate

EJDionne	687745761644310532	2016-01-14T21:19:01	That Obama had to use SOTU to answer GOP gloom: a sign that Dems, media are letting Trump dominate the discourse.
