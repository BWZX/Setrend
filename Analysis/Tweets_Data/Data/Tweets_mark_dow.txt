mark_dow	721461872415772672	2016-04-16T22:14:49	IvanTheK RobinWigg so you're saying there is no leakage elsewhere on a full order (no partials yet done) given to a particular exchange?
mark_dow	721461278821093376	2016-04-16T22:12:27	RobinWigg IvanTheK was referring to same-exchange leakage
mark_dow	721460854374334464	2016-04-16T22:10:46	IvanTheK RobinWigg agree. But it shouldn't allow someone to front run a full order given to a specific exchange, no?
mark_dow	721460443265372160	2016-04-16T22:09:08	IvanTheK RobinWigg Agree. But you wouldn't want guys hiding behind 'oops my bad' systematic sloppy execution while showing your orders out
mark_dow	721460043279806465	2016-04-16T22:07:33	IvanTheK RobinWigg Right. Whether that 3rd party has a collocated latency advantage or not. Is this currently illegal?
mark_dow	721459542303723520	2016-04-16T22:05:33	RobinWigg IvanTheK if I give you my order and you leak to Ivan my order deets before you start to execute my order, that wld be wrong, no?

mark_dow	721458755401965568	2016-04-16T22:02:26	IvanTheK RobinWigg that's okay by me. It's the nothing-done-leakage that I object to.
mark_dow	721458512958652416	2016-04-16T22:01:28	IvanTheK RobinWigg Right. Question is about leakage. It seems to happen and seems like it should be illegal.
mark_dow	721456548426305536	2016-04-16T21:53:39	IvanTheK RobinWigg so there is no way I can get front run if I send my order to the exchange where I see the bid?

mark_dow	707327143789731842	2016-03-08T22:08:27	DavidSchawel "huge negative for private sector" came across pretty normative tbh
mark_dow	707326035876978688	2016-03-08T22:04:03	DavidSchawel and I don't think the statement wld hold up w even conserv estimates of other main variables. Identities can mislead that way
mark_dow	707324387662237696	2016-03-08T21:57:30	DavidSchawel Your initial statement presupposes you know: asset replacement ratio, wealth effects, taxation impact and many other unknowns
mark_dow	707322750667329536	2016-03-08T21:50:59	DavidSchawel Never suggested it added assets. But yours is a partial analysis. Static too. So many other moving parts to calc total impact

mark_dow	689230281950101504	2016-01-18T23:37:59	modestproposal1 I used to argue with DavidSchawel that downward effect on yields was minimal. But that  changes as Fed holdings grow
mark_dow	689229711671595008	2016-01-18T23:35:43	modestproposal1 DavidSchawel LSAPs almost certainly over time lowered UST yields. Impossible 2say how much. 
mark_dow	689226845842112512	2016-01-18T23:24:19	DavidSchawel modestproposal1 Two different channels:  one is the s-t expectations channel, other's cummulative stock/scarcity effect

mark_dow	689212148707241984	2016-01-18T22:25:55	KymLang IMHO, it's an easy bet
mark_dow	689211153075978240	2016-01-18T22:21:58	KymLang Again, if it were true and you were Dallas Fed you'd STFU, not deny, right? And given ZH's rep, smells of more yellow journalism
mark_dow	689210369391214593	2016-01-18T22:18:51	KymLang If all the banks in Dallas district were involved it would leak eventually
mark_dow	689209855966449664	2016-01-18T22:16:49	KymLang Which sources and what are they corroborating?
mark_dow	689209259335094272	2016-01-18T22:14:26	KymLang If the Dallas Fed is lying, we will find out about it in time for sure. If not, we'll never hear about it again.
mark_dow	689208249308954625	2016-01-18T22:10:26	KymLang If they were doing it, why would they have said they weren't? Easy to prove if they were doing it. The opposite, tho, unfalsifiable
mark_dow	689206312647802880	2016-01-18T22:02:44	KymLang A bit of a Rorschach test until facts came out later. A lot of public posturing too by CEOs trying to elicit more financial support

mark_dow	687647083495469056	2016-01-14T14:46:55	ctorresreporter B/c they were modelling oil from futures curve which is upwardly sloped. So, if realized, wld hasten end of 'transitory'
