Carrasquillo	702365545065275392	2016-02-24T05:32:49	Mexicans are biggest group of Hispanic voters. Trump has offended many of them. And on top of that you're talking GOP Latinos, less of them.

Carrasquillo	700517099559452672	2016-02-19T03:07:46	Clinton seems to get louder applause than Sanders upon coming out. Sanders was shaking his head when cameras went to commercial.
Carrasquillo	700514578174619648	2016-02-19T02:57:45	Sanders seemed to suggest he was getting tough questions from Clinton supporters.

Carrasquillo	700508513286488065	2016-02-19T02:33:39	Certainly different from almost every other townhall/debate crowd. I think one white male has asked a question. 
Carrasquillo	700507813169143809	2016-02-19T02:30:52	Sanders: Today in 2016 a college degree is an equivalent of what a high school degree was 50 or 60 years ago.
Carrasquillo	700507085021147137	2016-02-19T02:27:58	"Yes you may pay a few cents more for a hamburger," Sanders says, of raising minimum wage.

Carrasquillo	700504470933807104	2016-02-19T02:17:35	Good question for Sanders here, he has talked about bringing back deported veterans. Veterans who ran afoul of the law and were deported.
Carrasquillo	700502510801330176	2016-02-19T02:09:47	Fair for Sanders to say "Hey I'm hitting Bill Clinton because he's been slamming me."

Carrasquillo	700501478096527360	2016-02-19T02:05:41	Here's a thing Latinos will like about this opening: jdbalart starts w/ first 2 questions and they're not just on "latino issues"
Carrasquillo	700500701315784704	2016-02-19T02:02:36	Interesting that Sanders won coin toss and chose to go first, prefers getting out of there I guess over waiting to see what they ask HRC
Carrasquillo	700500345009610753	2016-02-19T02:01:11	So the MSNBC opening is hilarious. Sounds like Eminem and Nate Dogg's Till I Collapse.
