smc90	725155661340893185	2016-04-27T02:52:37	Pv that changed though when the H-1B visas loosened, there was a huge influx of Indians into the Valley in 1990s (more mass =d more power)
smc90	725155308809625600	2016-04-27T02:51:13	Pv YES! Such a great example. personal ex: remember being immigrant kid embarrassed by mom's accent at grocery store checkout when young
smc90	725154859612291076	2016-04-27T02:49:25	20/ So people get confused bc they think something's about power when it's really not. That's why power *differentials* are FAR more useful.
smc90	725153993366839296	2016-04-27T02:45:59	19/ Unfortunately reflecting on this motivation is a tricky thing since then it becomes an identity crisis. That's playing out nationally rn
smc90	725153810390372353	2016-04-27T02:45:15	18/ As if the mission motivates them, when in reality they're confused b/c power no longer resides in some static entity (law, $, media etc)
smc90	725153569599574018	2016-04-27T02:44:18	17/ Both have power. Yet there's this sense of nobility+naivete the secondary players (far more interesting character-development wise) have
smc90	725153285389295616	2016-04-27T02:43:10	16/ In the TV show Billions, with the two protagonist/antagonists, one person has a ton of money the other has a ton of political influence
smc90	725152667413188608	2016-04-27T02:40:43	15/ And the dynamics change when you add in the individual vs collective dynamic 
smc90	725152254601363456	2016-04-27T02:39:04	14/ this seems obvious but don't think people pause to reflect on; we're on auto-pilot when it comes to mental associations w those entities
smc90	725151744913711104	2016-04-27T02:37:03	13/ Versus simply painting it in broad, black-and-white strokes of demographics alone or entities evolved ("media" "celebrities" "bankers")
smc90	725151402331410432	2016-04-27T02:35:41	12/ "The bully is always the one who punches down." Have to now pause and think, wait, who has power here, directionality of punch, context
smc90	725150789933666304	2016-04-27T02:33:15	11/ People calling Beyonce's latest a form of celebrity bullying. Does that really count though? When both/all entities involved have power?
smc90	725150286214520832	2016-04-27T02:31:15	10/ Or media outlets competing with each other: say early Politico vs. WaPo for instance
smc90	725149921570111489	2016-04-27T02:29:48	9/ Or a woman in an all-female band (// all-girls' schools) would have way different power than in another context.
smc90	725149297906487298	2016-04-27T02:27:19	8/ So for example, one entity would have power in one context but zero power in another. (Witness media and social and Trump phenom for ex).
smc90	725148900043182080	2016-04-27T02:25:45	7/ [credit to my dear friend in the trenches with me as female editors when we were at Wired, Laura -- we used to always talk about this]
smc90	725148533532332033	2016-04-27T02:24:17	6/ It is dynamic, ever-shifting, and highly dependent not just on context (time, place, etc) but on, more importantly, power *differential*
smc90	725148203713187840	2016-04-27T02:22:59	5/ "power" isn't some static thing -- this immovable thing that resides in entities or constructs like 'media' 'politics' demographics etc.
smc90	725147867845894144	2016-04-27T02:21:38	4/ and here's the thing (as obvious as it may seem but all the more impt I think for that reason to pause/reflect on):

smc90	725147291326287872	2016-04-27T02:19:21	2/ being a woman, and Indian, and educated, and coming from immigrant parents and that whole experience too;
smc90	725147100460253185	2016-04-27T02:18:35	1/ Been thinking about it in the context of few things: having traveled between worlds of media &amp; VC; TV show Billions; recent trip to D.C.;
smc90	725146442306834432	2016-04-27T02:15:59	0/ Something I've been thinking a lot about lately is the whole notion of "speaking truth to power"
smc90	725141898361339905	2016-04-27T01:57:55	This is interesting. Applies to media too (lots of //s btw startup idea &amp; trend+story picking)

smc90	724971352592138242	2016-04-26T14:40:14	michael_nielsen transport is derived demand, IMHO we should focus on its determinants: land use, availability of infra, social factors

smc90	724944214367285248	2016-04-26T12:52:24	Interesting to think about in connection with transport, although I think that market is more complex (not a once-every-few-years choice) 4/
smc90	724951317324648449	2016-04-26T13:20:37	mcnees I noticed it in general at about that time: manufacturers started emphasizing boot times in SSD machines.  Changed the market.
smc90	724944940258758656	2016-04-26T12:55:17	michael_nielsen With OS X, boot time stopped mattering (SSD or not) since you'd go weeks/months w/o having to do so.
smc90	724943971009581056	2016-04-26T12:51:26	But things _did_ change with SSD's, because the improvement was big enough to change the market. 3/
smc90	724943827723755521	2016-04-26T12:50:51	Presumably the same reason true: no PC supplier could get a sustained competitive advantage through incremental improvement to boot time 2/
smc90	724943645087027201	2016-04-26T12:50:08	Marchetti's constant reminds me of the near-constant of boot times for ~ 2 decades 1/

smc90	715799449163972608	2016-04-01T07:14:22	bznotes Agree. My personal thesis about it is that way around this is to de-anthropomorphize and find other 'creatures' or unembodied ways!

smc90	715798741337444352	2016-04-01T07:11:33	bznotes because manipulating emotions is a tale as old as time --
smc90	715798508670959617	2016-04-01T07:10:38	bznotes the problem is we are in complete denial about manipulating emotions, hence the confusion and difficulty
smc90	715798326902448128	2016-04-01T07:09:54	bznotes we'd be able to design for it -- e.g., building in or conveying transparency in intent [why the scenario in Her was so jarring]

smc90	715797129248317440	2016-04-01T07:05:09	bznotes plus people tend to conflate 'familiarity' with 'ethical' -- though there is a fine line and a hard line no one should cross -- but
smc90	715796537788510209	2016-04-01T07:02:48	bznotes of course any new tech paradigm almost by definition will push borders of familiar/known mores (renting couch, timesharing fleet),

smc90	715773675488866305	2016-04-01T05:31:57	5/ But in purchasing related transactions, if a screen is present, then relying on chatbots feels like going from Windows to MS-DOS.
smc90	715773634074255360	2016-04-01T05:31:47	4/ Sure, there are platforms where a “chat” framework works well, like Amazon Echo. Or certain use cases like customer service.
smc90	715773506118623233	2016-04-01T05:31:16	1/ Conversational commerce is unproven, even in Asia. If texting takes more time than clicking a button on a webview, why is it better?

smc90	715434227940990976	2016-03-31T07:03:06	shrinivassg had this discussion yesterday with deepakshenoy. His opinion was FDI rules only cover physical goods.
smc90	715433120116248576	2016-03-31T06:58:42	E-commerce includes services. And firms can't influence 'price of services sold'.  Does this apply to Ola/Uber then?

smc90	715398258902695940	2016-03-31T04:40:11	In other words, "E-commerce sites should know and stay within their limits*"  *Limits = what legacy/offline retailers can offer
smc90	715397373581611010	2016-03-31T04:36:39	Thus, what the govt. really is doing is preserving legacy/offline inefficiencies in Indian retail and ensuring those become the ceiling!
smc90	715396672876978176	2016-03-31T04:33:52	3. No post-purchase support: ensures customers perpetually stuck with lowest common denominator of service experience. 3/3
smc90	715396298384355328	2016-03-31T04:32:23	2. No inventory: takes away impetus to forecast/fulfill demand quickly &amp; improve supply chain
smc90	715395755742081026	2016-03-31T04:30:14	Let's unpack the 3 main effects of the new e-commerce FDI laws.  1. No discounts: takes away impetus to reduce costs/improve efficiency 1/3

smc90	715413425451479040	2016-03-31T05:40:27	anuhariharan I feel like 'good service' is a bullshit red herring here. Not a single person I know there could give a shit. Price only.
smc90	715413167526969344	2016-03-31T05:39:25	anuhariharan how does logistics infrastructure change because of this
smc90	715411450521477120	2016-03-31T05:32:36	anuhariharan The ruling was fascinating. I may take the time to read the raw source stuff v reported stuff (did same for TRAE), v revealing
smc90	715411195910443013	2016-03-31T05:31:35	anuhariharan you don't think there's some weird cultural judu around notions of ownership too? I only have anecdotal evidence but.
smc90	715402120548069381	2016-03-31T04:55:31	stevesi I wonder too. Not sure what proportion outsourcing services v direct investments/JVs v homegrown providers a la Infosys TCS etc.
smc90	715377201814704128	2016-03-31T03:16:30	.smc90 stevesi One could argue that "on demand retail", "social networks" &amp; "messaging apps" are the new "strategic industries". 😀
smc90	715376271169970176	2016-03-31T03:12:48	stevesi Yes, or maybe they have seen examples like what a simple social network or messaging app can lead to:) They get the 'toys' thesis.
smc90	715375528253853697	2016-03-31T03:09:51	stevesi touché. so I did:) Still -- don't think this is either/or. There is a thoughtful, considered approach to be had here.
smc90	715375340386783232	2016-03-31T03:09:06	stevesi Neither license raj extreme nor completely open either. Considered.
smc90	715375124535336961	2016-03-31T03:08:15	stevesi Right, but I really think the Indian govt is being surprisingly more smart about this stuff lately.
smc90	715374851565838336	2016-03-31T03:07:10	stevesi Am really not arguing protectionism here either. That's equally dangerous.
smc90	715374751825289219	2016-03-31T03:06:46	stevesi Or maybe consider other ways of creating same value not entirely/ solely dependent on foreign investment?
smc90	715374545100623873	2016-03-31T03:05:57	stevesi I honestly don't know, just been thinking a lot lately about cultural differences and how they play out
smc90	715374432399654913	2016-03-31T03:05:30	stevesi would Alibaba have 'won' in China if eBay had truly equal chance at outset as opposed to entering after network was built?
smc90	715374284772773888	2016-03-31T03:04:55	stevesi because when you have the kind of capital and power that foreign investment provides, how the hell can anyone compete?
smc90	715374123782832128	2016-03-31T03:04:16	stevesi (i.e., giving local players a chance to build network effects, then thrusting them on global scale to compete at user/market level)
smc90	715373915413958660	2016-03-31T03:03:27	stevesi where there is a power differential esp. on global scale. Your friend Alan pointed that out to me on Africa podcast:))
smc90	715373772862201857	2016-03-31T03:02:53	stevesi I don't think so, govt involvement is a pretty desi thing. And frankly, I don't think necessarily a bad thing for places where
smc90	715373010719379457	2016-03-31T02:59:51	So it's kind of fascinating to speculate what the restrictions on FDI mean, culturally.

smc90	715372646771200002	2016-03-31T02:58:24	Yet when I was in India most recently (heart of Gujarat), local regulators were fussed over the idea that car-sharing co's didn't *own* cars
smc90	715372304486649856	2016-03-31T02:57:03	They are OK with FDI in pure marketplaces.
smc90	715372110097481728	2016-03-31T02:56:16	But frankly most interesting part of  that no one's talking about yet is around notions of marketplaces &amp; 'ownership'

smc90	711809470876135425	2016-03-21T06:59:37	BenedictEvans so yes, in that sense not as truly penetrated by AI that reasons (the way say a more modular auto/robotic system would, with

smc90	711808866032324612	2016-03-21T06:57:13	BenedictEvans so hardware requires more specialization vs taking advantage of true *modularity* [cc asymco] - where SW overwhelms HW and

smc90	698898801214431232	2016-02-14T15:57:13	&gt; but goes beyond the limitations of classic decision theory and foundational work that predates the development of concept of ergodicity

smc90	697873483703799810	2016-02-11T20:02:59	...another ex of all this btw is how slow people were to realizing value of Snapchat stories, for similar reasons: 
smc90	697871114937065472	2016-02-11T19:53:34	Late to this thread but learning a lot.  
smc90	697870257784946688	2016-02-11T19:50:09	: it is completely blind to what's happening around world w how people use messaging in far broader, layered, nuanced ways. So watch there.
smc90	697869956474482689	2016-02-11T19:48:58	...to me a problem w/ all this coverage and discussion is same as why so much Western media missed WhatsApp phenom or late to WeChat phenom:
smc90	697869682003410944	2016-02-11T19:47:52	I agree with much (but not all) of this too -- and think that what brands can do on messaging is // &gt; media outlets! 
smc90	697869026920271872	2016-02-11T19:45:16	I agree with him here [c.f. this past thread ] 
smc90	697867849361035266	2016-02-11T19:40:35	Yes I was thinking of that too — Slack news bot seems like an obvious way to go  
smc90	697864970457915392	2016-02-11T19:29:09	joshdickson40 ah, I hear you there. But the way there is with today's tech I think in this case: messaging!
smc90	697864772306337792	2016-02-11T19:28:22	joshdickson40 -- has to add value beyond just "I need a website" (old print) --&gt;"I need a mobile app" (old web) --&gt; "I need a bot" today;)
smc90	697864579993341952	2016-02-11T19:27:36	joshdickson40 that's why I think it can't just be a distribution strategy but a content optimized for timing/context/mode strategy -- has
smc90	697862445839175680	2016-02-11T19:19:07	joshdickson40 interesting, why not? [I'm an Android user so can't use yet (sigh), just sharing reax so far as find paradigm interesting]
smc90	697857757261606912	2016-02-11T19:00:29	I already love Quartz for iPhone -- SMS style news briefs 
smc90	697856392158253056	2016-02-11T18:55:04	so will be interesting to see how they evolve their content/writing/design etc accordingly (while also balancing other mediums: web, mobile)
smc90	697856136607739904	2016-02-11T18:54:03	but, distribution and changing UX aren't only things I meant. It's about completely rethinking the content ground up given new medium, so

smc90	690676237837008896	2016-01-22T23:23:41	nwsltrMe But *not just as a distribution channel* -- that's key here -- it's thinking of it as a way of shaping content *differently*

smc90	690675967186972672	2016-01-22T23:22:37	peterrojas msg interesting! Of course I'm thinking of a more public-subscription phone number model, not unlike with email, here...
smc90	690672961292865538	2016-01-22T23:10:40	smc90 I recall msg tossing out the idea of doing a newsletter via Twitter DM.
smc90	690675561899757570	2016-01-22T23:21:00	Not to argue against certain universals or be exceptionalist. But I think the nuances matter very much here.
smc90	690675440038481920	2016-01-22T23:20:31	&amp; I do not believe our notions of how tech nec. progresses from early adopters on as Rogers outlined  applies abroad;
smc90	690674885559910401	2016-01-22T23:18:19	I noticed how all my cousins in India do not have as many apps on their smartphones. Few if any, more utility than anything, v techhy only
smc90	690674567795216384	2016-01-22T23:17:03	Though to be clear I do NOT believe apps are as big a deal as many media outlets think they are here
smc90	690674298143408128	2016-01-22T23:15:59	[omg I just went 3rd person there]
smc90	690674268019908608	2016-01-22T23:15:52	And also please, Sonal, let's not think about all this stuff so orthogonally (messaging has links, so web etc within; esp. in WeChat right!)
smc90	690673891870568448	2016-01-22T23:14:22	Depends of course on type. I also think part of it means optimizing for different modes: microwaiting-moment mode, immersion mode, etc.
smc90	690673662479839232	2016-01-22T23:13:27	Interestingly -- and very counterintuitively -- I bet (as in hypothesize) that one could be more immersed in content on messaging v internet
smc90	690673409965985794	2016-01-22T23:12:27	Takes notions of snackable content  and optimizing for "micro-waiting moments"  to a new level
smc90	690673121196507136	2016-01-22T23:11:18	How fun to rethink this from scratch though, eh?
smc90	690672939381829632	2016-01-22T23:10:35	Not necessarily true everywhere however. And plus I DO have an unlocked phone, so could do via adopting multiple SIM cards like abroad.
smc90	690672827943391232	2016-01-22T23:10:08	I was tempted to do one (more broadly/publicly than current), but then was like, uh, my identity is tied to my personal phone number...
smc90	690672612477825024	2016-01-22T23:09:17	Thinking about this some more: Not everyone uses email, so what about email newsletters gone messaging-native?
smc90	690671997043355648	2016-01-22T23:06:50	Pv indeed! That is also a point benedictevans and others often make, including in here: 
smc90	690671193251192834	2016-01-22T23:03:39	smc90 correct. Which is exactly why I have always said it is symbiotic, co-evolving relationship between medium &amp; message.
smc90	690670529997451265	2016-01-22T23:01:01	Pv Which is why I'm not a fan of the unidirectional framing of message &gt; medium or medium &gt; message; it's both: iterative, evolutionary...
smc90	690670269887750144	2016-01-22T22:59:59	Pv ...but the fine details for how to optimize, measure, experiment there do. That's the exciting tension/ balance here.
smc90	690670139126116353	2016-01-22T22:59:27	Pv As with previous history here, the basics/ broad strokes -- good stories, interestingness, starting conversations -- don't change... but
smc90	690669900558262273	2016-01-22T22:58:30	Pv as CREATORS -- not just consumers -- of 'content' [I hate that word but it is what it is;)] what can we do differently here?
smc90	690669802096951297	2016-01-22T22:58:07	Pv But it's also more than that. I mean I like that idea in the abstract, but concretely, I'm thinking,
smc90	690669227464757248	2016-01-22T22:55:50	That's what's at stake here. Not something only of leisure or only of necessity, but of both.
smc90	690668964775505921	2016-01-22T22:54:47	-- and with all its possibility :) I cannot get the idea of reaching people in new ways around the world out of my mind. I don't want to.

smc90	690668563762249728	2016-01-22T22:53:12	Seriously, there's a huge opportunity for us to do what other media outlets have done going -native: web-, mobile-, and now, with messaging-
smc90	690668121972015104	2016-01-22T22:51:26	Some people use messaging like WhatsApp in India as their news channel.
smc90	690667687781863425	2016-01-22T22:49:43	(Maybe that's just me though -- my cousins seem much less fazed by this.) This also opened my eyes to another view 
smc90	690666429054488576	2016-01-22T22:44:43	(Given all that, one key challenge will be figuring out how to help filter 'spam'. It's very jarring when you see on phone.)
smc90	690666222644387842	2016-01-22T22:43:54	Esp. since this time I noticed an evolution in use. People still use as their primary place to share photos, greetings, etc. Businesses too.
smc90	690666015902969856	2016-01-22T22:43:04	And also since most recent trip. I don't think anyone can fully absorb how people use it in places where mobile&gt;PC until seen w/ own eyes...

smc90	690665170016731136	2016-01-22T22:39:43	Been thinking about this since being deeply immersed in our WeChat piece [with Connie Chan]  -- and also since
smc90	690664323413184512	2016-01-22T22:36:21	Lately I've been thinking a lot about how to really make content *messaging-native*.
