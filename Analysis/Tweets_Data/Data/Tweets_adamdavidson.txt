adamdavidson	709012806696361986	2016-03-13T13:46:40	Econ_Marshall 7. You call it "elite opinion" but most people don't know that opinion exists.

adamdavidson	709011928300036097	2016-03-13T13:43:11	Econ_Marshall 4. Instead, discussion should be about ways to ensure better distribution of gains of trade.
adamdavidson	709011756694302720	2016-03-13T13:42:30	Econ_Marshall 3. Arguing trade=bad is as damaging as arguing trade is always good.
adamdavidson	709011657020805121	2016-03-13T13:42:06	Econ_Marshall 2. I have a different issue. There is a real debate on the left that is as (or more) simplistic as econ elite discussion.
adamdavidson	709011504020987904	2016-03-13T13:41:30	Econ_Marshall My turn: 1. I agree with every single thing you said.

adamdavidson	709008753895579648	2016-03-13T13:30:34	Econ_Marshall I doubt you fundamentally disagree with what I said. Is there serious public policy ideas that don't involve MORE trade?

adamdavidson	709007866494058501	2016-03-13T13:27:02	Econ_Marshall Now my turn: 1. You know that tariffs are not legitimate policy tools.
adamdavidson	709006948713238528	2016-03-13T13:23:23	Econ_Marshall That's what I said. Did you listen to what I said at all? You're literally repeating everything I said.

adamdavidson	688871873841631232	2016-01-17T23:53:48	Worth reading all of adamdavidson's rebuttals of this oddly sanguine vision of Wall Street:  
adamdavidson	688870460579299328	2016-01-17T23:48:11	adamdavidson completely agree! 5.5 yrs after Dodd Frank only 75% regulations adopted, some challenged in court, others not enforced!
adamdavidson	688869827713212417	2016-01-17T23:45:40	re: MikeGrunwald Big Short piece. I should have included FCIC on 2006 CDO shorts, FHFA lawsuit, like Ny1david did: 
adamdavidson	688869855110520832	2016-01-17T23:45:46	10. Clearly some CDO traders deliberately engineered financial products to deceive. They put their firms at great risk. But made a fortune.
adamdavidson	688868759415721985	2016-01-17T23:41:25	goharib True. I'd love to see securities law reform. Also: hard to prosecute lots of folks. Still important.
adamdavidson	688868484671995906	2016-01-17T23:40:19	9. I'd love it if there were a dozen H'wood movies about all the aspects. This one is an awesome look at one central part of the crisis.
adamdavidson	688868333874069504	2016-01-17T23:39:44	adamdavidson or at least some form of true blackballing.
adamdavidson	688868203926286336	2016-01-17T23:39:13	8. Lots of other causes: Global capital imbalances, savings glut, search for yield. Over-leverage (as you say).
adamdavidson	688867545374392321	2016-01-17T23:36:36	7. The system won't be fundamentally safer until Wall Street execs face life-ruining jail time, not shareholder paid fines.
adamdavidson	688867354458124289	2016-01-17T23:35:50	6. And if criminal prosecutions had been common pre-2006 for financial crime, bankers would likely have been far more cautious.
adamdavidson	688867120495591424	2016-01-17T23:34:54	5. The "stupid" argument is, also, quite strong. Clearly stupidity and criminality were at play.
adamdavidson	688866915771613184	2016-01-17T23:34:05	4. Without illegal activity, crisis would have probably been much smaller.
adamdavidson	688866621956472832	2016-01-17T23:32:55	3. I'm still confused why no charges came from the ProPublica and planetmoney PulitzerPrize winning series 
adamdavidson	688866316313296896	2016-01-17T23:31:42	2. To be clear: criminality (somewhat like CDOs) were absolutely causal (imho). By 2006, they were central.
adamdavidson	688865747616030720	2016-01-17T23:29:27	1. MikeGrunwald I would be grateful if you didn't speak for me. You're way off here.

adamdavidson	688730380216696835	2016-01-17T14:31:33	10. mikegrunwald It is highly irresponsible to tell America: don't worry. We solved that whole financial problem. Look away.
adamdavidson	688730291532361728	2016-01-17T14:31:12	9. mikegrunwald Whether or not criminality "caused" the crisis, sending guilty bankers to jail will shift the power dynamics.
adamdavidson	688730151442624512	2016-01-17T14:30:38	8. mikegrunwald and politically powerful firms are likely to be bailed out, whatever acronyms are in place.
adamdavidson	688730013018009600	2016-01-17T14:30:05	7. mikegrunwald this is bad for two reasons. Profits from rents are zero-sum transfers, not overall growth enhancing.
adamdavidson	688729883300728833	2016-01-17T14:29:34	6. mikegrunwald the fundamental issue is an industry that has more power than it should, captures regulators, engineers reg arbitrage.
adamdavidson	688729658414755840	2016-01-17T14:28:41	5. mikegrunwald like many, I don't believe the fundamental issue is the particular constellation of acronyms in place: tbtf, sifi, etc.
adamdavidson	688729492236447744	2016-01-17T14:28:01	4. mikegrunwald if anything, bank lobbying pressure increased.
adamdavidson	688729414620807168	2016-01-17T14:27:43	3. mikegrunwald There was not a fundamental change in the political economy of finance.
adamdavidson	688729285306281984	2016-01-17T14:27:12	2. mikegrunwald I would say that, fundamentally, our banking system has too much regulatory capture and rent seeking.
adamdavidson	688729167643439105	2016-01-17T14:26:44	1.mikegrunwald Our primary disagreement seems to be over the word "fundamentally."
adamdavidson	688491394403553280	2016-01-16T22:41:54	adamdavidson mikegrunwald  2) CDO accounting, which over valued Super Senior, allowed bankers to get paid up front for fake profits
adamdavidson	688479696380686337	2016-01-16T21:55:25	UrbanPat MikeGrunwald I‚Äôll endorse safer but not safe enough.
adamdavidson	688464752624947201	2016-01-16T20:56:02	adamdavidson JaffrayW Severity was also increased bc loan mods were not in the interest of those in higher tranches.
adamdavidson	688463356844445696	2016-01-16T20:50:29	adamdavidson GhostPanther absolutely! About bailouts, stimulus and reform. I'm used to it.
adamdavidson	688462923493171200	2016-01-16T20:48:46	MikeGrunwald GhostPanther I should ask: do you agree that most disagree with you? That's not everything, but it's something!
adamdavidson	688462474920751105	2016-01-16T20:46:59	11. MikeGrunwald And I have yet to meet anyone but you and Tim Geithner who think the system is fundamentally safer.
adamdavidson	688462272650412032	2016-01-16T20:46:11	10. MikeGrunwald D-F has many good parts and did address many issues. But banks are ever bigger, risk is ever more obscure.
adamdavidson	688462124608286720	2016-01-16T20:45:36	9. MikeGrunwald And do I really need to argue that D-F didn't fundamentally change banking?
adamdavidson	688461880764030977	2016-01-16T20:44:38	8. MikeGrunwald If so, here goes: Citi and others paid huge fines for deliberately misleading investors, including their own.
adamdavidson	688461747653574656	2016-01-16T20:44:06	7. MikeGrunwald Do I really need to prove the argument that criminality was a big part of the crisis?
adamdavidson	688461623091179520	2016-01-16T20:43:36	5. MikeGrunwald This makes me-and many others-believe that w/o CDOs the crisis would have been much less severe.
adamdavidson	688461480665190400	2016-01-16T20:43:02	4. MikeGrunwald Bc of their bespoke and confusing nature, CDOs made the solvency/liquidity determination very hard, worsening the crisis.
adamdavidson	688461287219707904	2016-01-16T20:42:16	3. MikeGrunwald I believe I know this b/c CDO sales went up as house price rise slowed.
adamdavidson	688461205237796864	2016-01-16T20:41:56	2. MikeGrunwald By 2006, imo, the risk-obscuring nature of CDOs propelled buying more than the housing price story.
adamdavidson	688461008013250560	2016-01-16T20:41:09	1.MikeGrunwald GhostPanther But here goes: CDOs are, imho, engineered regulatory arbitrage designed to obscure risk.
adamdavidson	688460790958022656	2016-01-16T20:40:18	MikeGrunwald GhostPanther To make my argument I don't need to prove the other stuff. Just that his view isn't fringe and obviously wrong.
adamdavidson	688460596648501248	2016-01-16T20:39:31	MikeGrunwald GhostPanther No. My argument is that you wrote a piece wrongly suggesting GhostPanther has a fringe, wrong view.
adamdavidson	688459035239145472	2016-01-16T20:33:19	.MikeGrunwald No. You use language of wrong and misguided without showing GhostPanther has the most common view of most. That's on you.
adamdavidson	688458875322896384	2016-01-16T20:32:41	.MikeGrunwald You chose to use that lyric to make a sharp (but incorrect) point.
adamdavidson	688457996251324418	2016-01-16T20:29:11	.MikeGrunwald You are making a much bigger claim: that the movie is only good for SenSanders.  It's a hard claim to support.
adamdavidson	688457500291641345	2016-01-16T20:27:13	.MikeGrunwald That isn't a myth. A lot of smart policy people agree: D-F went nowhere near far enough. That's not naive, lefty, or a myth
adamdavidson	688456950561030145	2016-01-16T20:25:02	MikeGrunwald ghostpanther I'm making a broader point. Perhaps (perhaps!) he misspoke off the cuff in an intvu. That's not the movie.
adamdavidson	688456764698836994	2016-01-16T20:24:18	6. MikeGrunwald oreillyfactor loved it. You are painting it as wrong, naive, and far left. That ain't right.
adamdavidson	688456356114857984	2016-01-16T20:22:40	5 MikeGrunwald  your piece suggests only SenSanders would like the movie. Many, many centrist and right-of-center folks love it.
adamdavidson	688455993685053440	2016-01-16T20:21:14	MikeGrunwald thebigshort Most believe bespoke, OTC derivatives are still a major issue and don't cover CDOs.
adamdavidson	688455669763182592	2016-01-16T20:19:57	5. MikeGrunwald You have every right to disagree. But I wish you hadn't belittled GhostPanther and thebigshort as misleading and wrong.
adamdavidson	688455195450322946	2016-01-16T20:18:04	4. MikeGrunwald every opinion you dismiss in thebigshort is held by many major economists and policy folks. Maybe most.
adamdavidson	688455030412832768	2016-01-16T20:17:24	3: MikeGrunwald And not many love Dodd-Frank as much as you.
adamdavidson	688454827211403264	2016-01-16T20:16:36	.MikeGrunwald I feel confident far more economists/policy folks agree with thebigshort that: CDOs and Crime + stupidity were causal.
adamdavidson	688454574223523840	2016-01-16T20:15:36	.MikeGrunwald I do wish you had said "My opinions are different from GhostPanther's" rather than use language of "right" and "wrong."
