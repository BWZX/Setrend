Blackhorse	719262819099795456	2016-04-10T20:36:33	Prospectus I would spend some time touching, feeling and groping. You never know. Worth a shot.
Blackhorse	719262636156784642	2016-04-10T20:35:50	Prospectus Hmm, if it wasn't originally there then there might be hope that you can discover what changed by the shove and adjust for it.
Blackhorse	719261615057727488	2016-04-10T20:31:46	Prospectus Does the owner's manual make reference to high-pitched hums? You may be right; it might be a "feature" of a high eff compressor
Blackhorse	719260349049008129	2016-04-10T20:26:45	Prospectus While it is making the noise, try touchjing, holding, moving any part you can get to on back, bottom, etc. See if it stops.
Blackhorse	719260113635274752	2016-04-10T20:25:48	Prospectus Obviously hard to diagnose from here, but with that high pitched sound I would suspect something somewhere is vibrating.
Blackhorse	719258707658412033	2016-04-10T20:20:13	Prospectus Have you inspected around the compressor area to make sure there are no loose parts vibrating (screws, retainer clamps, etc.)?
Blackhorse	719257189903413248	2016-04-10T20:14:11	Prospectus Where does the noise sound like it's coming from? Is it low, throbbing, high, buzzing?
