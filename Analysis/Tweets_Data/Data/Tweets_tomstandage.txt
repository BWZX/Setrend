tomstandage	718955280512458753	2016-04-10T00:14:31	Rand_Simberg Musk has said that the manufacturing cost (not the price) is about $60m; that's all
tomstandage	718955030712332288	2016-04-10T00:13:31	As the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage said to the bishop 
tomstandage	718954580223070209	2016-04-10T00:11:44	Rand_Simberg Or maybe SpaceX plans to increase margins by reusing first stage and dropping  price to, say, $40m (when cost is now ~$20m)
tomstandage	718954145517039617	2016-04-10T00:10:00	Rand_Simberg Best I can tell, price is $61.2m and cost is $60m. Other launches (NASA, military) priced higher. Building market share?

tomstandage	715305783701991425	2016-03-30T22:32:43	tomcoates I agree; I'm just not convinced that I want to deal with them by typing. On a smartphone.
tomstandage	715305621982220293	2016-03-30T22:32:04	tomcoates Indeed. There's a there there, but we haven't seen it yet. Bot aggregators, eg, because who wants to deal with multiple bots?
tomstandage	715305444848365572	2016-03-30T22:31:22	vgul Right, but "the command line for everyday life" is only a selling point to people who like command lines

tomstandage	715305012063240193	2016-03-30T22:29:39	tomcoates Tap, I can understand. But pure text-based chatbots don't allow that; just some bot-like apps. And then it's an app
tomstandage	715304809394528260	2016-03-30T22:28:50	Also a big dose of "fish where the fish are" here: people use chat apps, so deploy in chat apps. Plus, end-run around app stores—for now
tomstandage	715304362466222081	2016-03-30T22:27:04	I like the idea of bots, but GUIs exist for a reason (typing/command line is inefficient). Or is this just stepping-stone to voice UIs?

tomstandage	692290809618677760	2016-01-27T10:19:25	David_Tee KayBurley Yes, I think that's correct. Hard to see Apple going into soft drinks, though

tomstandage	692147019712978944	2016-01-27T00:48:03	tmccormick hiddenbiz Alas, even the biggest telcos (Verizon, China Mobile) generate only about $100bn/yr in revenue. Much less than Apple
tomstandage	692145359628402688	2016-01-27T00:41:27	This is great -- the mathematics of secrecy shows why conspiracy theories are unlikely to be true 
tomstandage	692143667121934340	2016-01-27T00:34:44	tmccormick hiddenbiz Media is a tiny business. 2015 box office revenues: $40bn. Music industry: $15bn. iPhone sales last quarter: $75bn.
tomstandage	692141985428283394	2016-01-27T00:28:03	tmccormick hiddenbiz I think Coca-Cola counts as a single consumer product; the entire catalogue of the App Store does not.

tomstandage	692137067409707010	2016-01-27T00:08:30	AGingerWarrior I think some cities will try it. Self-driving shared taxis/buses only, in city centres that are extensively mapped.
tomstandage	692136308316229632	2016-01-27T00:05:29	hiddenbiz Ooh, hadn't seen that. Sorry. Coca-Cola is a very good answer! Does indeed outgun iPhone on sales volume (if not revenue)!
tomstandage	692135584442220544	2016-01-27T00:02:37	GristoMill This is absolutely key: apps can't, and so don't, have instructions. They HAVE to be intuitive or they fail. It's great.
tomstandage	692135413583089665	2016-01-27T00:01:56	GristoMill Exactly! My 4yo son attracted a small crowd at SFO the day after the iPad came out. He'd figured it out straight away.
tomstandage	692134828146364416	2016-01-26T23:59:36	GristoMill Right. And who de-geeked it? Apple, with the touchscreen interface. Not any of the established handset-makers who ruled in 2000
tomstandage	692134521060352000	2016-01-26T23:58:23	tmccormick Well, even a car is a tech product in a way that houses aren't. And the Nano is probably not a great example. It was a flop.
tomstandage	692133844363931648	2016-01-26T23:55:42	tmccormick Maybe, but these are not high-tech electronic products, which is what Apple makes. They don't do farming or mining, either
tomstandage	692133640592048128	2016-01-26T23:54:53	hiddenbiz Any consumer product you like. Anything with a brand name. Razors. Detergent. Cars. Has anything else had $0.5 trillion in sales?
tomstandage	692133180208463875	2016-01-26T23:53:04	GristoMill Right. These are all point solutions. The real power of the smartphone: general purpose computing, cloud power, for everyone
tomstandage	692132892139454464	2016-01-26T23:51:55	tmccormick But I would love to be proved wrong by someone. Probably won't be Apple, though
tomstandage	692132824783196161	2016-01-26T23:51:39	tmccormick I am sceptical; very difficult business to scale; logistical nightmare
tomstandage	692132462479216640	2016-01-26T23:50:12	dmont812 Yup. AR glasses; then smart contact lenses; then neural implants, like the "neural lace" in sci-fi.

tomstandage	692132039777206272	2016-01-26T23:48:32	AGingerWarrior But some cities will ban driverless cars (not safe!) while others ban traditional ones (not safe!). We'll see who's right
tomstandage	692131784834826240	2016-01-26T23:47:31	AGingerWarrior I think safety/liability worries will encourage adoption of driverless cars in city centres. Much safer
tomstandage	692131142535876608	2016-01-26T23:44:58	tmccormick Not really in Apple's wheelhouse, though. Agricultural products are also quite popular. And iron ore.

tomstandage	692130475826135041	2016-01-26T23:42:19	GristoMill I was there too. At the time, people thought: video-calling. Picture messaging. Maps. Only a tiny part of the picture.
tomstandage	692130194115694595	2016-01-26T23:41:12	hiddenbiz Apple has sold something like 800m iPhones, at around $600 each. What other product has comparable sales? Half a trillion $.
tomstandage	692129416122626048	2016-01-26T23:38:06	hiddenbiz Single products, rather than categories? Name one.
tomstandage	692129320333135872	2016-01-26T23:37:43	GristoMill So did smartphones, in 2000. They were pretty useless. And we had only a vague idea of what we'd use them for. (No Facebook!)
tomstandage	692128423125323777	2016-01-26T23:34:09	Fagashlil76 greg_jenner That is exactly Apple's problem. When something is new you get rapid take-up by non-users—but only for a while
tomstandage	692128269945192448	2016-01-26T23:33:33	Fagashlil76 greg_jenner We all do that already. Existing users upgrading every two years = slower sales than people buying for first time
tomstandage	692128052680249344	2016-01-26T23:32:41	GristoMill I reckon AR/VR has the same problem MP3 players, smartphones, tablets did; previous (non-Apple) implementations were clunky
tomstandage	692127773247344641	2016-01-26T23:31:34	PJCavan annemcelvoy I think the 1 billion figure includes Macs, too. 1 billion iOS devices sold, but I have several old, dead iPhones, eg
tomstandage	692127095267397632	2016-01-26T23:28:53	AGingerWarrior GristoMill Depends; if you constraint the domain (city centres, no other vehicles, no snow) they work now
tomstandage	692126838617985025	2016-01-26T23:27:52	greg_jenner Augmented reality, probably. Not watches, anyway
tomstandage	692126663023448064	2016-01-26T23:27:10	CharlesPHoffman Yes, but they are of course ONLY interested in future growth. That is what they are paid to find interesting
tomstandage	692126493527425024	2016-01-26T23:26:29	GristoMill Selling transport services is a better business, but Apple is useless at services. Maybe augmented/virtual reality, in 2018?
tomstandage	692126159799259140	2016-01-26T23:25:10	GristoMill Cars are a horrible business. That's not the answer. Driverless cars will not be owned, so we'll only need 10% as many
tomstandage	692125941544402949	2016-01-26T23:24:18	annemcelvoy There's room for growth in emerging markets, obviously. But rapid growth as 500m rich people bought iPhones? Over.
tomstandage	692125464522022913	2016-01-26T23:22:24	annemcelvoy You can, but we're now in a replacement market (buy new smartphone every 2 years) not an upgrade market (buy first one now)
tomstandage	692125209499951104	2016-01-26T23:21:23	GristoMill Also, iPod was easier to follow because it wasn't the biggest consumer-electronics category in the world. Smartphones are.
tomstandage	692124862488408068	2016-01-26T23:20:00	GristoMill Indeed. But perhaps the technology for that next category (AR?) isn't quite ready yet. It's not watches, anyway
tomstandage	692124694573641728	2016-01-26T23:19:20	timtom Agreed; computers are getting smaller and closer to our bodies. But wearables aren't as big a category... yet ARimplants
tomstandage	692123259555418115	2016-01-26T23:13:38	Apple's problem: the iPhone is the single most successful consumer product in the history of the world. How do you follow that?
