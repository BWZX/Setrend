KSoltisAnderson	698704578397630464	2016-02-14T03:05:27	I like that Rubio is trying to go after the very word - amnesty - by offering a better definition ("forgiveness WITHOUT consequences")
KSoltisAnderson	698702387096264704	2016-02-14T02:56:45	Last time anyone voted for Reagan was 1984. Youngest voters then were born in 1966. So now, youngest who ever voted for Reagan is 50.

KSoltisAnderson	698699197722132480	2016-02-14T02:44:04	The sad reality is that Trump can say "9 percent GDP growth? Why not! I can do it. It'll be great. " and....nothing matters
KSoltisAnderson	698698085799624704	2016-02-14T02:39:39	This debate feels....very weird. Like a WWE match mashed up with a blog comments section.

KSoltisAnderson	698679857648001024	2016-02-14T01:27:13	I tweet that because lots of people tweeting things like "obligated to confirm qualified appointees!" which isn't technically in there.

KSoltisAnderson	698675020059422720	2016-02-14T01:08:00	RonBrownstein GOP Sen has right to withhold consent, should set extremely high bar for Scalia seat. Just gaming out all possible outcomes.
KSoltisAnderson	698673846266765313	2016-02-14T01:03:20	Loss of Justice Scalia not only blow to originalism &amp; conservatism. Court loses a razor-like intellect, diamond-sharp interrogator, &amp; wit.
KSoltisAnderson	698673728096350208	2016-02-14T01:02:52	RonBrownstein I wonder who might be worse for my side to swallow -- an Obama attempted compromise nom (if offered) or an HRC/D Sen Maj nom

KSoltisAnderson	698639757253804032	2016-02-13T22:47:52	For those asking, yes the Supreme Court can (and not irregularly does) hear cases with only eight justices sitting.
KSoltisAnderson	698669254577618946	2016-02-14T00:45:05	C'mon people. The Democrats spent months blocking Bork. Kennedy was Reagan's third choice, a forced compromise.
KSoltisAnderson	698655292255576065	2016-02-13T23:49:36	Lindsey Graham said that President Obama "abused power" in changing rules for appellate justices. Now it's payback time. This will be ugly.
KSoltisAnderson	698666230031503360	2016-02-14T00:33:04	Huge missed opportunity if the debate becomes about what Obama/the Senate should do rather than whether you'd trust Trump to replace Scalia.

KSoltisAnderson	698662726726451200	2016-02-14T00:19:09	Holy crap I just realized who Obama could nominate to the Court to completely scramble everyone's brain: Richard Posner.

KSoltisAnderson	698662123187105793	2016-02-14T00:16:45	Small technical point: It's not a filibuster when the majority chooses not to take up an appointment on the floor.
KSoltisAnderson	698661860283977729	2016-02-14T00:15:42	Let us all follow Scalia's example. Fight like hell for what we believe in while never hesitating to show humor and kindness to all.

KSoltisAnderson	698653450263875584	2016-02-13T23:42:17	Question for my legal eagle friends: is there anyone Obama could appoint who would be a genuine "swing vote" on the court?

KSoltisAnderson	698645899266887680	2016-02-13T23:12:17	This is how bad polarization has become: when nominated to SCOTUS 30 years ago, Scalia was confirmed 98-0.
KSoltisAnderson	698636193068613635	2016-02-13T22:33:43	Dissenting opinions written by Scalia were invariably my favorite things to read when major decisions came down and he was in the minority.
KSoltisAnderson	698631856321724416	2016-02-13T22:16:29	Just wow. Thoughts and prayers to Scalia's family.
KSoltisAnderson	698629400900870145	2016-02-13T22:06:43	Politics aside, we should all die full of years, with 28 grandchildren, in our sleep after quail hunting. Antonin Scalia RIP.
KSoltisAnderson	698627614504660993	2016-02-13T21:59:37	Going to stop myself from analyzing the political implications for a second and just say RIP to a brilliant mind.

KSoltisAnderson	694824860699197440	2016-02-03T10:08:50	GOP needs to add voters to its ranks; tedcruz and marcorubio represent very different strategies to do so:

KSoltisAnderson	694392967738626048	2016-02-02T05:32:39	96.07% of precincts reporting: Clinton 49.85% to Sanders 49.55%.

KSoltisAnderson	694391536130363392	2016-02-02T05:26:58	Vote counting continues - but the contrasting tone of the Bernie &amp; Hillary speeches &amp; the soundbites they produced - give Sanders the night.
KSoltisAnderson	694391595681062912	2016-02-02T05:27:12	The "lapsed" caucus goer point here seems key to why Trump winning first timers + high turnout still didn't save him 
KSoltisAnderson	694389870941306880	2016-02-02T05:20:21	I still think &lt;50% chance Trump = nominee but 1 out of 4 caucus goers picked Donald Freaking Trump and that's not nothing. joenbc is right.

KSoltisAnderson	694387243633512448	2016-02-02T05:09:54	stranter Yes! This is what I want to know - people doing work using modeled scores - was there a Trump drop-off or was he always overblown
KSoltisAnderson	694386645156630529	2016-02-02T05:07:31	Polls were kind right, when they were released but were released late.  Large modeled stratified sample FTW

KSoltisAnderson	694384536646504448	2016-02-02T04:59:09	Trump winning 1st time caucusgoers is the data point that drove thinking behind "high turnout helps Trump"

KSoltisAnderson	694380360608698369	2016-02-02T04:42:33	RobSaliterman Theoretically because they are weighted to actual results the final product is good
KSoltisAnderson	694380214160351233	2016-02-02T04:41:58	But it has to feel good for anti-Trump folks that the late deciders who waited to weigh all evidence ultimately took a pass on the Donald
KSoltisAnderson	694379534641152001	2016-02-02T04:39:16	One more thing to note: Trump may not have faded at all -- perhaps his actual support was just never as high as public polls suggested
KSoltisAnderson	694377404253540356	2016-02-02T04:30:48	Voting wise, both are conservatives. But there are many, many ways to take a conservative message to the world. 
KSoltisAnderson	694376380042182656	2016-02-02T04:26:44	This Cruz speech vs. That Rubio speech. If you ever wanted a clear, simple encapsulation of the fork in the road for the GOP, this is it.

KSoltisAnderson	692909514698391553	2016-01-29T03:17:56	Exactly. Plus Walker. The Trump tornado has made this race so much worse.

KSoltisAnderson	692903451836026880	2016-01-29T02:53:51	I don't think this debate is "boring because Trump's not here" but because questions haven't really gotten people off script.

KSoltisAnderson	692901272702230528	2016-01-29T02:45:11	This is actually the story of this entire campaign -- if not for Trump, Cruz would have come across as more extreme 
KSoltisAnderson	692901274765885440	2016-01-29T02:45:12	If I knew it would end up in a presidential debate I probably would have googled different things tbh.
KSoltisAnderson	692901273469751296	2016-01-29T02:45:11	And his answer was great! 
KSoltisAnderson	692899274154094592	2016-01-29T02:37:15	I stand by this sentiment from the last Fox debate.

KSoltisAnderson	692898204199706624	2016-01-29T02:32:59	In part because it's the opposite of everything he's been saying about Trump all week. 
KSoltisAnderson	692897755509817344	2016-01-29T02:31:12	Cruz is hurting himself with overly pushy approach to trying to redefine the debate and seize time hurts him and makes him smaller
KSoltisAnderson	692897655286927360	2016-01-29T02:30:49	Cruz's weird moment there totally undercuts his "Donald Duck" criticism about Trump running away from tough questions.
KSoltisAnderson	692895202487308292	2016-01-29T02:21:04	I'm about the 5,000th person to note the fact that we're getting actual substantive policy debate here but this is really amazing.

KSoltisAnderson	692690358929641474	2016-01-28T12:47:05	Trump basically read the Gospel backwards last night, going from "turn the other cheek" to "an eye for an eye." A perfect moment.

KSoltisAnderson	692148881975549955	2016-01-27T00:55:27	If you dislike Trump, ditching Fox debate is "weakness/petulance". If you like Trump, this is "he knows when to walk away from a bad deal!"

KSoltisAnderson	692143368529432577	2016-01-27T00:33:33	Interesting angle: if it is perceived as weakness, that cuts into core attribute ("strength"). But...who knows. 
KSoltisAnderson	692142552783392768	2016-01-27T00:30:18	And media mentions drive votes. Debates have only significantly helped other candidates not Trump.
KSoltisAnderson	692142413893259265	2016-01-27T00:29:45	Let's back this out. Debates are a net negative for Trump because they equalize the number of media mentions between candidates.
KSoltisAnderson	692140610099286016	2016-01-27T00:22:35	Also: only time Trump's poll numbers have plateaued are post- debates where he's not the big headline...

KSoltisAnderson	691672539693617152	2016-01-25T17:22:38	On Friday, I go out to California to join the RealTimers panel to discuss what an insane journey the last seven months have been. RealTime
KSoltisAnderson	691672279609028609	2016-01-25T17:21:36	On June 26th, 2015, Trump was in 9th in the RCP poll avg in Iowa, 8th nationally. I went on RealTimers and said Trump wouldn't win.
KSoltisAnderson	691663364322295808	2016-01-25T16:46:11	Nicely done. 
KSoltisAnderson	691661236296003585	2016-01-25T16:37:43	With four factions, there's surely a way to assign each to a Game of Thrones or Harry Potter house. Have at it, internet.
KSoltisAnderson	691659998724685824	2016-01-25T16:32:48	The reason why this battle now is so bitter is that without a clear leader on the right, all four factions are fighting to be kingmaker.
KSoltisAnderson	691659011930783745	2016-01-25T16:28:53	LPDonovan mental images I never wanted: Trump dressed up as a swan a la Bjork
KSoltisAnderson	691658541787017216	2016-01-25T16:27:01	DavidMDrucker amyewalter LPDonovan Well yes, it's a symptom."If you have pro-Trump thoughts for more than 15 mins, call your doctor."
KSoltisAnderson	691657864817954816	2016-01-25T16:24:20	To amyewalter and LPDonovan wise point: why do some in "party" faction think Trump can win? My guess: unpredictability.
KSoltisAnderson	691656910672531456	2016-01-25T16:20:32	But the party folks and the conservative intellectuals are panicked for different reasons. Hence different preferences in "Trump vs. Cruz."
KSoltisAnderson	691656620783185920	2016-01-25T16:19:23	Anyhow, when people say "the establishment" is panicking about Trump vs. Cruz, I suspect they mean BOTH the party and conservative brains...
KSoltisAnderson	691654059133005824	2016-01-25T16:09:12	The party vs. intelligentsia split over Trump vs. Cruz is rooted in whichever side of that chicken and egg problem you come down on.
KSoltisAnderson	691653919424978948	2016-01-25T16:08:39	There's a chicken and egg problem. What's the point of ideas if you can't implement them? But what's the point of governing with no ideas?
KSoltisAnderson	691652903774257153	2016-01-25T16:04:37	The party is -- rightly -- hungry to get back into the White House, for without that, how do you implement the ideas?
KSoltisAnderson	691652705337511936	2016-01-25T16:03:49	The intelligentsia would like to win this next election, sure, but they'd much rather keep conservatism alive and vibrant.
KSoltisAnderson	691652050845724672	2016-01-25T16:01:13	I don't think that the party and the intelligentsia need to be at odds or at war, but their objectives are slightly different.
KSoltisAnderson	691651863838482432	2016-01-25T16:00:29	The intelligentsia kind of rolls its eyes at angst over "the GOP brand" and sort of thinks the party deserves the brand it's gotten.
KSoltisAnderson	691651622749995010	2016-01-25T15:59:31	The party is focused on winning elections (and some also care about governing). They care about the GOP brand, how to we get the votes, etc.
KSoltisAnderson	691651489584910336	2016-01-25T15:59:00	Yesterday there was a great exchange on ThisWeekABC between Rich Lowry and Alex Castellanos that illustrates the divide.
KSoltisAnderson	691650884422381568	2016-01-25T15:56:35	Then the final groups - party and intelligentsia - are what people are mashing together as "the establishment" and are doing so incorrectly.
KSoltisAnderson	691650669128732672	2016-01-25T15:55:44	Note: the "entertainers" are not the same as the "grassroots," though certainly the entertainers do wield influence there.
KSoltisAnderson	691650541256990720	2016-01-25T15:55:13	There's the activists, the grassroots. Usually motivated by a cause (the Constitution, etc.). No one candidate has them all, but Cruz leads.
KSoltisAnderson	691649989466927104	2016-01-25T15:53:02	The entertainers seem to have coalesced around Trump. Fine. And fairly predictable.
KSoltisAnderson	691649870285791232	2016-01-25T15:52:33	The entertainers are easy to spot. Their primary goal is more listeners/book sales/viewers and their primary product is outrage.
KSoltisAnderson	691649739964559360	2016-01-25T15:52:02	I view four factions or sectors on the right: the party, the intelligentsia, the activists, and the entertainers.
