davealevine	725436567066689541	2016-04-27T21:28:50	1/ What is a bank?
davealevine	725449787810656257	2016-04-27T22:21:22	83/ I do think that the legacy banks are vulnerable. Retail, compliance, and IT organizations are all a big step behind new entrants.
davealevine	725449584739229696	2016-04-27T22:20:33	79/ Some will exploit natural economies of scale in wholesale delivery of the simplest financial products.
davealevine	725449471480487936	2016-04-27T22:20:06	77/ We'll see some banks try to build franchise by doubling down on brand and customer service. (&lt;- where we want to play)
davealevine	725448504676630528	2016-04-27T22:16:16	61/ Customer experience may be branded independently of the underlying regulated entities, at any desired level of granularity.

davealevine	725448160907284480	2016-04-27T22:14:54	56/ But I think that banks have had a relatively gentle ride so far. We are still in the early stages of the commodification of banking.
davealevine	725447723114217476	2016-04-27T22:13:10	51/ So banks would no longer be necessary intermediaries between short‐term depositors seeking safety and long‐term borrowers seeking risk;
davealevine	725447646874329088	2016-04-27T22:12:51	50/ If financial assets could be marketed anywhere, the advantages conferred on banks by their privileged access would be eroded:
davealevine	725437058475511809	2016-04-27T21:30:47	4/ Rather, banks manage a balance sheet and earn a spread between their cost of funds and the return on their (financial) assets.

davealevine	725395725639667713	2016-04-27T18:46:32	thogge shaig Twitter remains the most relevant and meaningful source for realtime information (especially on mobile).

davealevine	725392695393406976	2016-04-27T18:34:30	thogge shaig plus at this point the stock is just cheap even on near term numbers.

davealevine	721112408455004162	2016-04-15T23:06:10	LadyFOHF jsndacruz my point in posting the specific language is to point out the Faith based nature of the logic.
davealevine	721111650363916288	2016-04-15T23:03:09	LadyFOHF jsndacruz I Have A Dream.  
davealevine	721110178096156672	2016-04-15T22:57:18	LadyFOHF jsndacruz But using your logic he shouldn't have been able to appeal to that Higher Power to justify his political agenda.
davealevine	721109980372406272	2016-04-15T22:56:31	LadyFOHF jsndacruz Religion can be a force for Good and is perhaps more often than not.
davealevine	721109753418674176	2016-04-15T22:55:37	LadyFOHF jsndacruz leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. rightly appealed to a higher morality to fight for freedom. That is great.
davealevine	721109209971060736	2016-04-15T22:53:27	LadyFOHF jsndacruz but why can't it be religious?
davealevine	721107299549519872	2016-04-15T22:45:52	LadyFOHF bringing it back to my initial observation: that is the power of the metaphor of the Progressive and the Pope joining forces.
davealevine	721107056024010752	2016-04-15T22:44:54	LadyFOHF I hear you. Perhaps I'm more optimistic about the reconciliation of the perspective of equality and religion.
davealevine	721106631006810112	2016-04-15T22:43:13	LadyFOHF the key isn't to eliminate people's faith or to reduce their ability to hold it, but rather to require the respect of all faiths.
davealevine	721106214805979137	2016-04-15T22:41:33	LadyFOHF but that grants a privileged position to the non-religious when the History is that religion is at the foundations of government.
davealevine	721103251442167808	2016-04-15T22:29:47	LadyFOHF like I said: there is no immunity from criticism or responsibility for failing to act in concert with the Ideal we know to be true
davealevine	721102862286262272	2016-04-15T22:28:14	LadyFOHF that isn't fair. The principles of the great religions embrace the poor and charity.
davealevine	721102738973700097	2016-04-15T22:27:45	LadyFOHF but to your point: that doesn't grant one immunity from criticism or responsibility.
davealevine	721102522065252352	2016-04-15T22:26:53	LadyFOHF but IMO we shouldn't be afraid to embrace Religion and Faith. Billions of people live by these principles everyday.
davealevine	721102350530822144	2016-04-15T22:26:12	LadyFOHF this is the legacy of the American success story. Religious freedom was a strategic advantage when it mattered. Should remain so
davealevine	721102170062471169	2016-04-15T22:25:29	LadyFOHF BUT religious equality and respect for difference (or lack thereof) is equally if not more important.
davealevine	721102024046206977	2016-04-15T22:24:54	LadyFOHF Religion is one of the most important things in people's lives. No reason that shouldn't be part of those who serve.

davealevine	721101449808232448	2016-04-15T22:22:37	LadyFOHF Progress happens and it takes leaders to make it happen.
davealevine	721101383164895232	2016-04-15T22:22:21	LadyFOHF my point is that Pontifex publicly embracing such a progressive figure as BernieSanders is progress in itself and vice versa.
davealevine	721100031307223040	2016-04-15T22:16:59	LadyFOHF things change. progress happens!

davealevine	697989729216765952	2016-02-12T03:44:54	Jesse_Livermore DavidSchawel I hear you. It (and equities) have done the trick on wealth effect to this point.
davealevine	697989557468401664	2016-02-12T03:44:13	Jesse_Livermore DavidSchawel housing has been doing ok and seems fine. US economy seems fine too. But that's not enough.

davealevine	697988759695073280	2016-02-12T03:41:02	Jesse_Livermore DavidSchawel I've been thinking 20-30%. (Brings us to 1600ish).
davealevine	697988624797802496	2016-02-12T03:40:30	Jesse_Livermore DavidSchawel makes me think we go lower than 1600.

davealevine	697987397817102336	2016-02-12T03:35:38	Jesse_Livermore DavidSchawel those forward numbers seem way* too high, right?

davealevine	697987110888960000	2016-02-12T03:34:29	Jesse_Livermore DavidSchawel my POV about US equities was also about relative yield. Helps explain S&amp;P resilience here I think.
davealevine	697986746622074880	2016-02-12T03:33:03	Jesse_Livermore DavidSchawel yep. You were right sounds like. What do you think from here on their fundamentals?

davealevine	697982959429799936	2016-02-12T03:18:00	Jesse_Livermore DavidSchawel my view on Japan is industry is secularly challenged. Economy shouldn't grow. Didn't (don't) have EPS target
davealevine	697981652581117953	2016-02-12T03:12:48	Jesse_Livermore DavidSchawel the risk off environment makes the fundamentals relevant again. They weren't for awhile.
davealevine	697981091093856256	2016-02-12T03:10:34	Jesse_Livermore DavidSchawel this sell off isn't about demographics. But the fundamentals of the struggling economy are real and permanent
davealevine	697980895572135936	2016-02-12T03:09:48	Jesse_Livermore DavidSchawel no those are separate points.  Secular trends = 1 point = industry in trouble.  Energy = nukes.  Demographics
davealevine	697978624947986433	2016-02-12T03:00:46	Jesse_Livermore DavidSchawel :-). More just saying the fundamentals ultimately matter in Japan. Took longer than I thought!
davealevine	697978263801622529	2016-02-12T02:59:20	Jesse_Livermore DavidSchawel this sell off in Japan is getting pretty violent. Makes sense given relative rally seems like.

davealevine	696900885704790017	2016-02-09T03:38:13	ajkurki that doesn't mean everyone should try to be a short-seller or macro investor. Simple common sense works fine
davealevine	696900683644198912	2016-02-09T03:37:25	ajkurki take last year (or early this year). After such a long run and at such valuations, reducing exposure is simply prudent.
davealevine	696900465552924672	2016-02-09T03:36:33	ajkurki sorry reckless: meaning, people oversimplify the options. You can be a patient long term investor *and be aware of cycles.
davealevine	696900250250977280	2016-02-09T03:35:42	ajkurki I didn't call anyone stupid. I just think you posed a false dichotomy. There are more options than do nothing and be wreckless.

davealevine	695998648983953411	2016-02-06T15:53:03	btaylor I also think Twitter is special *because it is hard. Wrote about that: 
davealevine	695998349217001473	2016-02-06T15:51:52	btaylor The emergent phenomena of how we collaborate / share / curate content realtime during live experiences  isn't replicable.

davealevine	695997853253169152	2016-02-06T15:49:53	btaylor I'm open to considering that at the edges of the experience algorithms could enhance it: onboarding, returning to feed, away...

davealevine	695996492776087552	2016-02-06T15:44:29	btaylor supplementing onboarding, "while you were away", recommended content, are all natural and positive enhancements.

davealevine	695995807183609856	2016-02-06T15:41:46	btaylor Facebook is good for social things. Perhaps the Algo helps with that. But Twitter is better for many things because it is realtime.
davealevine	695995207314182146	2016-02-06T15:39:23	btaylor disagree. Twitter's utility is real-time personalized feeds. Facebook is an inferior information product because of the algorithm.

davealevine	691327264034799616	2016-01-24T18:30:38	HFM17Mile (not that this was new information, simply a reminder of what we already knew - that this risk remains).
davealevine	691327144962736128	2016-01-24T18:30:10	HFM17Mile CDS is fine but backwards looking. What we learned last summer is the nature of the risk is political (meaning the cause).
davealevine	691321837268160512	2016-01-24T18:09:04	HFM17Mile Europe is much clearer though. Last summer was a warning shot about the current existing risks in that sovereign credit market.

davealevine	691278336165842945	2016-01-24T15:16:13	blippd HFM17Mile these losses seem to be important to understand and could be enough depending on how they cascade.
davealevine	691278152287547393	2016-01-24T15:15:29	blippd HFM17Mile  this is hurting sovereign wealth funds and other sovereign expenditures already.
davealevine	691277860779233280	2016-01-24T15:14:19	blippd HFM17Mile it is big but I don't thing big enough alone. However there are other large losses in the oil markets.
davealevine	691275096363778048	2016-01-24T15:03:20	HFM17Mile if we get to the point of systemic risk emerging this would for sure have implications for the real economy.
davealevine	691274959767863297	2016-01-24T15:02:48	HFM17Mile Pro-cyclicality (or "reflexivity") is hard to stop so as things get worse in financial markets this could hurt real economy.
davealevine	691274581617831936	2016-01-24T15:01:18	HFM17Mile the question about developed market recession has a couple answers. Even without SRDV a recession could occur eventually.
davealevine	691266428670992385	2016-01-24T14:28:54	HFM17Mile from here on as we are in the contraction phase the question is how big are losses and are they systemic not if they will come.
davealevine	691266218028834816	2016-01-24T14:28:04	HFM17Mile liquidity is contracting in the mean time and risk is emerging more broadly so it could be that credit risk emerges elsewhere.
davealevine	691264462024634369	2016-01-24T14:21:05	HFM17Mile These have different dynamics and nuances but seem to be the most important to follow through 16 and 17.
davealevine	691264303169675265	2016-01-24T14:20:27	HFM17Mile There are many large credit markets where risk could emerge but the 2 most likely are: Dollar denominated EM corporate and Europe
davealevine	691263300236136448	2016-01-24T14:16:28	HFM17Mile the "passive magic" phenomenon makes equities more risky than in the past. But this isn't most likely candidate.
davealevine	691263110582267904	2016-01-24T14:15:43	HFM17Mile This would be weird but it seems possible (not likely) if we are down another 20% that they could cause contractions in credit.
davealevine	691262867220381696	2016-01-24T14:14:45	HFM17Mile Something new this cycle is that equities are so complacently held, I wonder if they could become SRDV.
davealevine	691262711238369280	2016-01-24T14:14:08	HFM17Mile For something to be systemic in nature, losses need to be on the order of Trillions so big markets matter.
davealevine	691262489053532160	2016-01-24T14:13:15	HFM17Mile (before moving from US corporate credit, the CDS graph should keep widening as defaults pick up in '16).
davealevine	691262119111704581	2016-01-24T14:11:46	HFM17Mile meaning, if losses don't emerge elsewhere they likely aren't big enough alone to be SRDV. Thus other markets come into focus.
davealevine	691261826970095616	2016-01-24T14:10:37	HFM17Mile however, unlike housing (which had underlying losses on the order of Trillion), US corporates aren't as systemic this cycle.
davealevine	691261128421302272	2016-01-24T14:07:50	HFM17Mile defaults in the US began rising last year and as a result distressed indices sold off dramatically (down 40%).
davealevine	691260246157713412	2016-01-24T14:04:20	HFM17Mile I mean credit cycle by the term (Dalio has similar but different ideas worth checking out if you haven't seen his video).

davealevine	690183443171393536	2016-01-21T14:45:30	Well at least it's a BeautifulDay.  
davealevine	690182299296665601	2016-01-21T14:40:57	treehcapital :-) fair enough. It's an interesting idea..I often find myself scrolling scrolling scrolling back.
davealevine	690180281450532865	2016-01-21T14:32:56	treehcapital I don't think it is a mirage. The way it works now: the tweets we see are happening now. We are "here" at the same time.

davealevine	690179038124609537	2016-01-21T14:28:00	treehcapital would make it less "real time" and more "catalogue all tweets" but could see why folks might prefer that
davealevine	690178877298229249	2016-01-21T14:27:21	treehcapital interesting question. The "while you were gone" has been a nice addition. I kinda prefer it this way but see what you mean
davealevine	690176011632246784	2016-01-21T14:15:58	treehcapital you mean like "where you left off"?

davealevine	689925943046049793	2016-01-20T21:42:17	CAVandy but even these markets (commodities and especially oil) have had credit fueled booms and busts before. It happens :-)
davealevine	689925813391736832	2016-01-20T21:41:46	CAVandy The way risk emerges is always different and the extremes of oil and such are of course somewhat unique to this cycle.
davealevine	689925646227607552	2016-01-20T21:41:06	CAVandy IMO. This is normal. cycles exist and repeat. When defaults rise, markets contract. We were in a low risk environment for awhile.
davealevine	689914341911576577	2016-01-20T20:56:11	CAVandy ericbeebo I hope they don't emerge and we can have a "normal" period of drawdown and recovery but we can't be certain yet.
davealevine	689914111363289088	2016-01-20T20:55:16	CAVandy ericbeebo no matter how many times smart people say "this isn't like '08". Large tail risks remain and are increasingly likely.
davealevine	689913984632373251	2016-01-20T20:54:46	CAVandy ericbeebo reason is until we have line of sight on the end of this cycle can't take realistic tail risks off the table.
davealevine	689913851618430976	2016-01-20T20:54:14	CAVandy ericbeebo it matters IMO for companies that are very exposed to the cycle (like these). Others will grow through it. Matters less
davealevine	689912495444791296	2016-01-20T20:48:51	CAVandy ericbeebo sadly we aren't at the bottom IMO. Need more distress. More declines. More risk emerging. But on the other side...:-)
davealevine	689912224752799744	2016-01-20T20:47:46	CAVandy ericbeebo but I hear you. Before long will be interesting to buy distressed stuff broadly.
davealevine	689911946934665216	2016-01-20T20:46:40	CAVandy ericbeebo but the other stuff they own is prolly way bigger. No opinion on valuation but probably market exposed.
davealevine	689910631009484800	2016-01-20T20:41:27	CAVandy ericbeebo yep. This part of the cycle (and beyond) is when alpha is actually possible again.
davealevine	689910500650541056	2016-01-20T20:40:55	CAVandy ericbeebo can see some of these distressed credits being compelling but without that level of analysis seems dangerous to own
davealevine	689910377522597889	2016-01-20T20:40:26	CAVandy ericbeebo and of course which equities will have value in those post-reorg companies.
davealevine	689910244395343872	2016-01-20T20:39:54	CAVandy ericbeebo key is to know which can be converted to equity through a bankruptcy process. Requires case by case analysis.
davealevine	689908410020708353	2016-01-20T20:32:37	PragmaticProfit cool. I don't know about that one. Sounds like you know it well.

davealevine	689839745522913280	2016-01-20T15:59:46	BathosMan pkedrosky sadly that isn't right. Most don't have fiduciary duty. 
davealevine	689839275819556864	2016-01-20T15:57:54	GLD holding up quite well.
davealevine	689838264455434240	2016-01-20T15:53:53	BathosMan pkedrosky clearly there are exceptions and I'm generalizing. Many advisors are excellent fiduciaries.
davealevine	689837578170818560	2016-01-20T15:51:09	pkedrosky my beef is mainly with so-called "advisors" with no fiduciary duty who have every incentive to keep people fully invested.
davealevine	689837411199746048	2016-01-20T15:50:30	pkedrosky yeah. It isn't easy. But too many people (with bad incentives) just tell everyone to sit tight even when risks are glaring.
davealevine	689834892771860480	2016-01-20T15:40:29	pkedrosky Doesn't have to be perfect. Anyway, it just sucks that so many people are going to be crushed by this and it felt foreseeable.
davealevine	689834730947252225	2016-01-20T15:39:51	pkedrosky On an absolute basis sure, but even a simple rule that reduces when at extremes would have protected people here.
davealevine	689834394664706049	2016-01-20T15:38:30	pkedrosky but trust me, I've heard all the arguments about how trying to time markets is impossible, blah, blah, blah. Sad to watch.
davealevine	689834220932501505	2016-01-20T15:37:49	pkedrosky yeah...that's what people say but I don't really buy that. reducing exposure when teetering near all-time highs seems prudent.
davealevine	689833462342270977	2016-01-20T15:34:48	pkedrosky yeah and being "that guy" at the party. I also can't for the life of me understand why everyone is so averse to go to cash.
davealevine	689832824082403328	2016-01-20T15:32:16	pkedrosky Strange part is how many (including the media) seem to have been caught flat footed even though it has been a long-time coming.
davealevine	689831059320627201	2016-01-20T15:25:15	thalesians simply a turn in the credit cycle that began last year and will continue. the factors above contribute to this turn.
davealevine	689827037364756480	2016-01-20T15:09:16	Good thing is, Progress is inevitable even on days like this.  But not gonna lie, that drawdown on a certain stock definitely stings :-).
davealevine	689826585516625920	2016-01-20T15:07:29	Anyhow, the cycle has been turning since last year and will continue to for awhile. This is sadly still the early stages of it.

davealevine	689649485820092416	2016-01-20T03:23:45	jake_f market coming their way for sure but I guess I disagree with him on both how he describes '08 and today.
davealevine	689648411218448384	2016-01-20T03:19:28	jake_f I'm a fan of his. Have been for years but this one seems like exasperation and unclear concern about concern.
davealevine	689646360879091714	2016-01-20T03:11:20	BrattleStCap ACapMgmt yeah I meant both. Assets broadly (that tweet was overly simplistic :-)). More research  ttyl
davealevine	689644525569101824	2016-01-20T03:04:02	BrattleStCap this proves housing effect is real. One of the two I noted. This isn't the only research on the subject.
davealevine	689643122972823552	2016-01-20T02:58:28	BrattleStCap he just wrote this today. Why so emphatically in disagreement?

davealevine	689623119036833794	2016-01-20T01:38:58	SkeleCap ACapMgmt BrattleStCap sorry bro. Tough spot to be in.

davealevine	689622894901661696	2016-01-20T01:38:05	SkeleCap ACapMgmt BrattleStCap yeah. You follow Altman's defaulted bond index? Very important to track IMO. Down 40% last year.
davealevine	689622378561851393	2016-01-20T01:36:02	SkeleCap ACapMgmt BrattleStCap Fed is in a tough spot because fundamentals are strong even though markets are contracting.

davealevine	689622007810498560	2016-01-20T01:34:33	SkeleCap ACapMgmt BrattleStCap this is why equities are down IMO and should keep pulling them down at least down 20-30%.
davealevine	689621820065071104	2016-01-20T01:33:49	SkeleCap ACapMgmt BrattleStCap Credit cycle. SWF drag is real. Defaults up. High yield blowing out, distressed selling off...
davealevine	689621277657714688	2016-01-20T01:31:39	SkeleCap ACapMgmt BrattleStCap issue is the cycle is turning so markets are going to dislocate from fundamentals for awhile.
davealevine	689621169859862528	2016-01-20T01:31:14	SkeleCap ACapMgmt yeah BrattleStCap (and others) rightly point out wage data feels like it has to budge. That's why Fed raised IMO

davealevine	689620447852363776	2016-01-20T01:28:21	SkeleCap BrattleStCap ACapMgmt yeah the housing momentum should remain for a bit. US fundamentals should chug along even as markets fall
davealevine	689620259637174272	2016-01-20T01:27:37	SkeleCap BrattleStCap ACapMgmt "consumer confidence" is a big spending driver. This is market driven (and unemployment)
davealevine	689620116229771264	2016-01-20T01:27:02	SkeleCap BrattleStCap ACapMgmt Yellen mentions income but Greenspan has always focused on markets. Fair point on income.
davealevine	689619797164867584	2016-01-20T01:25:46	BrattleStCap ACapMgmt who said anything about income inequality? Look at the spending data. We are talking about consumer spending right?
davealevine	689619650901118976	2016-01-20T01:25:11	This helps to explain why VIX remains low as asset prices contract. Real money / asset allocation weighing on prices 
davealevine	689618246480302080	2016-01-20T01:19:37	BrattleStCap ACapMgmt so what is your alternative explanation? That their theory was wrong but the data supports it?
davealevine	689617858318434304	2016-01-20T01:18:04	BrattleStCap ACapMgmt how do you think they were wrong? Bid up equity markets to peaks -&gt; people buy more stuff. Seemed to work well.
davealevine	689617499608977408	2016-01-20T01:16:39	BrattleStCap ACapMgmt here 
davealevine	689617406940045312	2016-01-20T01:16:16	BrattleStCap ACapMgmt no. They were right. Look at the spending data. It is up.
davealevine	689616719543955456	2016-01-20T01:13:33	BrattleStCap ACapMgmt these are the ones driving. This is the entire game: increase asset prices to drive spending. It worked!
davealevine	689616558830788608	2016-01-20T01:12:54	BrattleStCap ACapMgmt check out these three people's quotes 
davealevine	689616217070551040	2016-01-20T01:11:33	BrattleStCap ACapMgmt no. I'm not confusing anything. This is driven by the equity markets and housing prices not rates.

davealevine	688826778610171904	2016-01-17T20:54:36	@mindsetrisk I've found Twitter much more useful for meeting people of all kinds than LinkedIn. Haven't used the latter much for blogging
davealevine	688825902394900481	2016-01-17T20:51:07	@mindsetrisk do you mean public company management? Do you think LinkedIn is better for that?

davealevine	688817186094321668	2016-01-17T20:16:29	This is simply domestic credit and likely conservative. What matters are total credit losses globally. cycle

davealevine	688811458185015296	2016-01-17T19:53:43	modestproposal1 we have to think about scenarios down 20%+ in equities and where credit risk cascades.
davealevine	688811321454915584	2016-01-17T19:53:11	modestproposal1 but this is missing the idea that there are other adjacent credit markets where risk could and likely will spread.

davealevine	688572341907935232	2016-01-17T04:03:34	rushtonjdr the contraction is underway. We left the top of the cycle last year.
davealevine	688569070287892480	2016-01-17T03:50:34	LongShortTrader it was driven by cyclical expansion. Market was up so highly shorted names rallied excessively.
davealevine	688568223978008577	2016-01-17T03:47:12	LongShortTrader this is a good analogue. Has to do with the cycle contracting (vs expanding). Same idea.
davealevine	688557617761763328	2016-01-17T03:05:03	LongShortTrader I use the term loosely to mean getting the cyclical expansion story / growth story right.
davealevine	688557481631469568	2016-01-17T03:04:31	LongShortTrader but you are right that people got complacent with the pattern of the last few years.

davealevine	688244976661082113	2016-01-16T06:22:44	dandolfa important to recognize that 2012-2014 was very different than 2010-2011 due to ex-US issues (mainly Europe)
davealevine	688244628651261952	2016-01-16T06:21:21	dandolfa interesting. Note it was written in 2011 and already observed mortgage effect. Thx for sharing.
davealevine	688243827555995648	2016-01-16T06:18:10	dandolfa thanks for that. Open to considering any analysis. But to me, the expected hypothesis and observed reality comport with it worked!
davealevine	688243135814602753	2016-01-16T06:15:25	dandolfa of course respect the analytical effort and empirical approach. But important to be rigorous with common sense as well.
davealevine	688243000640552960	2016-01-16T06:14:52	dandolfa there is a danger is academic analysis when the set of observations is n=1 like this issue. Risk of false precision.
davealevine	688242744582512640	2016-01-16T06:13:51	dandolfa ok. Well I disagree with those conclusions. Glad to read analysis and consider alternatives but seems unlikely.
davealevine	688242577015869440	2016-01-16T06:13:11	PrometheusAM BathosMan nah. I'm good and don't have any "suspicion".
davealevine	688242278872170496	2016-01-16T06:12:00	dandolfa not sure exactly what you mean, but if you think ZIRP, QE and other actions didn't impact financial markets broadly we disagree
davealevine	688241629191249920	2016-01-16T06:09:25	PrometheusAM BathosMan my view is we all agree equities are down 20+% in 2016. Question is tail risk beyond that right?
davealevine	688241504431648768	2016-01-16T06:08:56	PrometheusAM BathosMan the systemic risks are many and it isn't clear exactly how they will materialize.
davealevine	688241304300457984	2016-01-16T06:08:08	PrometheusAM BathosMan 1) I was responding to what I perceived as condescending verbiage. 2) I am partially through that explanation.
davealevine	688240749750530050	2016-01-16T06:05:56	PrometheusAM BathosMan :-) ok so how did I fail?
davealevine	688240656913838085	2016-01-16T06:05:34	BathosMan PrometheusAM @KeshikCapital DavidSchawel mark_dow do you mean prices of US securities or the security of the country?
davealevine	688240229577146368	2016-01-16T06:03:52	PrometheusAM BathosMan @KeshikCapital DavidSchawel mark_dow which part failed?
davealevine	688239733722382336	2016-01-16T06:01:54	PrometheusAM BathosMan @KeshikCapital DavidSchawel mark_dow what is your side of the debate exactly?
davealevine	688239098025230336	2016-01-16T05:59:22	PrometheusAM BathosMan @KeshikCapital DavidSchawel mark_dow go ahead and be long risk assets if you want. You seem confident.
davealevine	688239020011200512	2016-01-16T05:59:03	PrometheusAM BathosMan @KeshikCapital DavidSchawel mark_dow I never said "this is like '08". And I'm not done. But I need to go to bed
davealevine	688237852832825344	2016-01-16T05:54:25	dandolfa these are normal market dynamics that are impossible to parse completely from the direct impact.
davealevine	688237744078729216	2016-01-16T05:53:59	dandolfa it's ok if these factors help increase impact of actions (look at Europe pre-QE and price movement)
davealevine	688237619684089857	2016-01-16T05:53:30	dandolfa don't think that matters. The psychology of markets is part of price impact - big buyers cause people to anticipate and bid higher
davealevine	688237460246024192	2016-01-16T05:52:52	dandolfa not really. This was the biggest change by far that had targeted and direct intent based on a clear hypothesis. And it worked!
davealevine	688237024545918976	2016-01-16T05:51:08	PrometheusAM @KeshikCapital DavidSchawel mark_dow seems too small to matter but could be.
davealevine	688236855620337664	2016-01-16T05:50:27	dandolfa so...the hypothesis: that these programs would stimulate security prices and the economy - worked! Evidence supports hypothesis.
davealevine	688236713215328256	2016-01-16T05:49:53	dandolfa markets reacted as expected and targeted.
davealevine	688236646249005056	2016-01-16T05:49:37	dandolfa based on evidence. Fed introduced ZIRP, QE, LSAP - unprecedented trillion dollar actions.
davealevine	688236359140544512	2016-01-16T05:48:29	PrometheusAM @KeshikCapital DavidSchawel mark_dow anyhow. This is the key point. You call it "European politics".
davealevine	688236112750350337	2016-01-16T05:47:30	PrometheusAM @KeshikCapital DavidSchawel mark_dow yes.
davealevine	688235984635346945	2016-01-16T05:47:00	@KeshikCapital PrometheusAM DavidSchawel mark_dow Canada seems in a tough spot but probably to small to matter also (sorry Canucks!)
davealevine	688235884009816064	2016-01-16T05:46:36	@KeshikCapital PrometheusAM DavidSchawel mark_dow Africa isn't big enough to matter. More "Asia ex" and South America that matters.
davealevine	688235717449793537	2016-01-16T05:45:56	dandolfa yeah this seems flat wrong. LSAP's and QE helped housing, equities and the economy. It worked! But it doesn't protect markets.
davealevine	688235139155898368	2016-01-16T05:43:38	PrometheusAM @KeshikCapital DavidSchawel mark_dow but that leaves the "European politics" point you mentioned.
davealevine	688235022252244992	2016-01-16T05:43:10	dandolfa also unfair to compare Japan to US which is most important global market.
davealevine	688234934369005569	2016-01-16T05:42:49	dandolfa when QE / easing occurs simultaneously in multiple markets (US, UK, Japan) effects should be broader.
davealevine	688234770824704000	2016-01-16T05:42:10	dandolfa different market environment so hard to say but maybe.

davealevine	688234411393826817	2016-01-16T05:40:45	PrometheusAM @KeshikCapital DavidSchawel mark_dow the secondary effects of these sovereign matters are also difficult to trace.
davealevine	688234310898302976	2016-01-16T05:40:21	PrometheusAM @KeshikCapital DavidSchawel mark_dow quantifying the scale, timing and magnitude is important and hard to do with precision.
davealevine	688234133013659648	2016-01-16T05:39:38	PrometheusAM @KeshikCapital DavidSchawel mark_dow these remain to be seen and should emerge through 2016.
davealevine	688234054404030465	2016-01-16T05:39:19	PrometheusAM @KeshikCapital DavidSchawel mark_dow commodity market contractions have sovereign implications beyond US credit.
davealevine	688233941841543169	2016-01-16T05:38:53	PrometheusAM @KeshikCapital DavidSchawel mark_dow regarding China this sounds probable but that isn't the end of the story.
davealevine	688233132252766208	2016-01-16T05:35:40	dandolfa this analysis doesn't make sense. Of course QE's effect impacted other markets.
davealevine	688232146473881600	2016-01-16T05:31:45	@KeshikCapital PrometheusAM DavidSchawel mark_dow expect they will attempt the same again but I hear why that is harder now.
davealevine	688232055524622336	2016-01-16T05:31:23	@KeshikCapital PrometheusAM DavidSchawel mark_dow yeah. There was potential for a big restructuring but they just hushed it.
davealevine	688231256073478149	2016-01-16T05:28:12	@KeshikCapital PrometheusAM DavidSchawel mark_dow how big are those two markets?
davealevine	688231183524564992	2016-01-16T05:27:55	@KeshikCapital PrometheusAM DavidSchawel mark_dow anyhow so the two areas you mentioned: EM ex China and "European politics".

davealevine	688229710464069633	2016-01-16T05:22:04	@KeshikCapital PrometheusAM DavidSchawel mark_dow could be China credit risk is bigger than last time.
davealevine	688228917287583744	2016-01-16T05:18:55	@KeshikCapital PrometheusAM DavidSchawel mark_dow oops. Beyond China: where else are you worried about credit?
davealevine	688228842368942081	2016-01-16T05:18:37	@KeshikCapital PrometheusAM DavidSchawel mark_dow anyhow: beyond ACH
davealevine	688228748403949568	2016-01-16T05:18:14	@KeshikCapital PrometheusAM DavidSchawel mark_dow but systemic events/contractions typically require large credit losses.
davealevine	688228596410757124	2016-01-16T05:17:38	@KeshikCapital PrometheusAM DavidSchawel mark_dow the currency issues introduce new factors beyond credit that matter

davealevine	688227608790601729	2016-01-16T05:13:43	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow let me ask you guys a question: what credit market concerns you today?
davealevine	688227506596352002	2016-01-16T05:13:18	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow yes, we are still with Marks and others here: "no subprime so no worries"
davealevine	688227216329576449	2016-01-16T05:12:09	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow (congrats on your algebra skills. Yes this is too small to matter).
davealevine	688227137183023105	2016-01-16T05:11:50	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow but the systemic transmission mechanisms need to be way bigger than energy high yield
davealevine	688227013895688192	2016-01-16T05:11:21	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow this is just a matter of cyclical contractions that are predictable and we are in.
davealevine	688226906529857538	2016-01-16T05:10:55	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow I remain steadfast by this call I've had since before this year.
davealevine	688226779111149568	2016-01-16T05:10:25	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow let's pause: equity markets should be down 20%+ regardless of systemic risk.
davealevine	688226695099236352	2016-01-16T05:10:05	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow anyhow the key thing to watch for systemic risk is credit markets.
davealevine	688226617353572353	2016-01-16T05:09:46	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow I don't like that word. I prefer "pro-cyclicality" but yeah. Kinda like "reflexivity"
davealevine	688226381050728448	2016-01-16T05:08:50	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow when the credit cycle turns the key thing to watch is credit markets.
davealevine	688226292873859074	2016-01-16T05:08:29	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow (it's impossible to be positive and this cycle should more rapid so this is possible)
davealevine	688226084983193601	2016-01-16T05:07:39	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow (meaning equities likely aren't the transmission mechanism but they could be)
davealevine	688225993887121409	2016-01-16T05:07:18	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow but this (likely) isn't the systemic issue. It could be but probably not.
davealevine	688225871992233984	2016-01-16T05:06:49	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow this effect continues as adjacent assets decline and exacerbates the declines in prices
davealevine	688225700885614595	2016-01-16T05:06:08	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow but these types of contractions / sales matter more as we enter the contraction phase.
davealevine	688225563522150405	2016-01-16T05:05:35	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow If we were at a different point of the credit cycle this might matter less
davealevine	688225445855113216	2016-01-16T05:05:07	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow will cause a reduction of holdings in adjacent risk assets including equities.
davealevine	688225328372695050	2016-01-16T05:04:39	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow it is hard to quantify the effect of oil prices but the significant decline in value...
davealevine	688225176824090626	2016-01-16T05:04:03	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow one basic concept is asset allocation and the effect on security prices.
davealevine	688225084218081281	2016-01-16T05:03:41	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow instead, the same mechanisms that worked on the way upcycle are reversing and will
davealevine	688224950537158657	2016-01-16T05:03:09	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow sorry traditional economic indicators to have a sense of how risk assets will perform.
davealevine	688224859948630017	2016-01-16T05:02:47	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow thus it is difficult to use traditional
davealevine	688224782286860290	2016-01-16T05:02:29	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow they've become a mechanism for influencing economies and not vice versa
davealevine	688224660329136128	2016-01-16T05:02:00	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow this cycle is different because risk assets were disconnected from fundamentals in '08
davealevine	688224492615696384	2016-01-16T05:01:20	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow the transmission mechanisms from here varied across risk assets including equities.
davealevine	688224275539480578	2016-01-16T05:00:28	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow but this is just one market where credit has been extended without appropriate pricing
davealevine	688224125941223424	2016-01-16T04:59:52	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow the math of CCC defaults is like clockwork. And yet it was ignored until 2015.
davealevine	688224020005654528	2016-01-16T04:59:27	PrometheusAM DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital mark_dow US corporate credits are just one example and CCC issuance a great early indicator.
davealevine	688223270366126081	2016-01-16T04:56:28	DavidSchawel PrometheusAM @KeshikCapital and, sigh, yes, US banks are fine and don't have subprime exposure. Yes US economy is fine.
davealevine	688222983345680387	2016-01-16T04:55:20	DavidSchawel PrometheusAM @KeshikCapital yes, the geniuses who point out the US consumer is doing fine are of course correct.
davealevine	688222855952072704	2016-01-16T04:54:50	DavidSchawel PrometheusAM @KeshikCapital the various pockets of underpriced large pools of risk are many and broad reaching.
davealevine	688222722854260737	2016-01-16T04:54:18	SkeleCap @KeshikCapital PrometheusAM trengriffin true that
davealevine	688222677048295424	2016-01-16T04:54:07	DavidSchawel PrometheusAM @KeshikCapital anyway. We're 7 years into a period where central banks pretended like risk didn't exist.
davealevine	688222478112436225	2016-01-16T04:53:19	SkeleCap @KeshikCapital PrometheusAM trengriffin zerohedge is an idiot and always has been.
davealevine	688222407044169729	2016-01-16T04:53:03	DavidSchawel PrometheusAM @KeshikCapital but the thing Marks and others miss are the broader credit risks remaining.
davealevine	688222330258993152	2016-01-16T04:52:44	DavidSchawel PrometheusAM @KeshikCapital from a simple point of view as credit contracts, equities will follow. That's obvious.
davealevine	688222225636274176	2016-01-16T04:52:19	DavidSchawel PrometheusAM yes, the simple point mentioned in the piece @KeshikCapital cited before is substantial. Equities are junior.
davealevine	688222051937591296	2016-01-16T04:51:38	DavidSchawel PrometheusAM @KeshikCapital there are many ways the transmission works and it has been working.
davealevine	688221135419256838	2016-01-16T04:47:59	DavidSchawel PrometheusAM @KeshikCapital I've been making the broad call since early 2015 and it became clear by the end of the year.
davealevine	688220723786076162	2016-01-16T04:46:21	dandolfa which part of the Fed effects? On housing, QE or otherwise? There were many.
davealevine	688220475894308868	2016-01-16T04:45:22	DavidSchawel PrometheusAM @KeshikCapital I disagree with his framework in detail but it is a good approximation and spelled out.
davealevine	688220381010739200	2016-01-16T04:45:00	DavidSchawel PrometheusAM @KeshikCapital the credit cycle has existed since the early 1990's. Dalio has some decent stuff on this.
davealevine	688219889455116289	2016-01-16T04:43:02	dandolfa we disagree. The Fed intervened to support housing markets. That worked and supported markets broadly, which was a positive.
davealevine	688219628833640448	2016-01-16T04:42:00	DavidSchawel PrometheusAM @KeshikCapital the increase in defaults and collapse of distressed credit is a symptom of the broader cycle.
davealevine	688219286314168324	2016-01-16T04:40:39	DavidSchawel PrometheusAM the default rate rising is a sign of the cycle turning. But as @KeshikCapital points out it isn't everything.
davealevine	688219088225619968	2016-01-16T04:39:51	DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital PrometheusAM (yes corporate credit is the key statistic to track, see the picture by my name)
davealevine	688218981581238272	2016-01-16T04:39:26	DavidSchawel @KeshikCapital PrometheusAM this cycle the way the credit cycle will transmit through the system is of course different.
davealevine	688218859564695552	2016-01-16T04:38:57	dandolfa if you don't think the Fed impacted the prices of securities markets we disagree.
