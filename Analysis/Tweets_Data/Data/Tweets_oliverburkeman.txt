oliverburkeman	707664657327267840	2016-03-09T20:29:36	meatball_jun Even then, you'd need to explain the unique first-person sense of being conscious, though ‚Äì¬†totally unlike any other function.

oliverburkeman	685195843339710465	2016-01-07T20:26:34	drlangtry_girl I liked how entire evidence base for this piece was Gdn's tagging system (this story filed under "Germany" not "feminism")
oliverburkeman	685189765319254016	2016-01-07T20:02:24	This looks super-interesting, although also a highly curious use of the word "new" in the subtitle 
oliverburkeman	685187815584448512	2016-01-07T19:54:40	emmabrockes LucyMangan A question that never need be asked among columnists imho
oliverburkeman	685187501292650496	2016-01-07T19:53:25	KayEngels mrianleslie added to reading list
oliverburkeman	685187356387897344	2016-01-07T19:52:50	mrianleslie anyway remember, anytime you and jonathanshainin fall out over neoliberalism, you can make up over mutual Adam Phillips love

oliverburkeman	685186514582634496	2016-01-07T19:49:29	oliverburkeman I've seen half of the first episode, you can talk to me, but mainly about hairstyles.
oliverburkeman	685186318868058112	2016-01-07T19:48:43	mrianleslie &gt; that too, as Jung did in Freud's case and paid for it‚Ä¶
oliverburkeman	685186272554520578	2016-01-07T19:48:32	mrianleslie &gt; that he then used to reach hilariously dogmatic and probably wrong conclusions. Ironically of course one could psychoanalyze&gt;
oliverburkeman	685186140064870400	2016-01-07T19:48:00	mrianleslie There's lots of Freud I haven't read of course, but the general sense I get is: a perspective &amp; a method that embodies it &gt;
oliverburkeman	685185914956550145	2016-01-07T19:47:06	francescaelston Also true ‚Äì¬†but not imaginary as a consequence. Haha yes little point trying to flesh this out here though sadly

oliverburkeman	685184792279801856	2016-01-07T19:42:39	Genuine issue with binge watching. I called emmabrockes to rant about various things in ep5 &amp; she's all like, "yeah ‚Äì I can't say anything"
