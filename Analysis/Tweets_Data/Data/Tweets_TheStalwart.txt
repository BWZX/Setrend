TheStalwart	721404221640151040	2016-04-16T18:25:44	This is key. The prepackaging of it undermines a huge reason people want to drink this stuff.

TheStalwart	721402638890373120	2016-04-16T18:19:26	Hmm. I've just tweeted 6 times in a row on a juicer, which is more than I've tweeted on any other topic in years.
TheStalwart	721402401853452289	2016-04-16T18:18:30	That's the key contradiction. The people who want to spend big on veggie juice, won't buy these industrial ingredient packages.
TheStalwart	721402232491667456	2016-04-16T18:17:49	But zero cleanup that uses little vegetable packs is why I'm bearish. If I want to drink vegetables, I don't want food from a packet.
TheStalwart	721402010155761664	2016-04-16T18:16:56	FWIW, the worst part of most juicers is the cleanup. I'd be more bullish on a juicer had zero cleanup that used fresh vegetables.

TheStalwart	721400461639696386	2016-04-16T18:10:47	BTW, if you don't tweet your prediction on the Juicero, I'll assume you think it's a smash hit. And -- yikes -- that might be embarrassing.
TheStalwart	721399754651906049	2016-04-16T18:07:59	TheStalwart It fits many trends (thoughtless consumption, "health," convenience) but I would never buy a unitasker with DRM'd food.

TheStalwart	721399350056853504	2016-04-16T18:06:22	Then in 2 years, we can look back on these tweets to determine who has credibility or not on all kinds of issues.
TheStalwart	721399223003045888	2016-04-16T18:05:52	StephenWHudson1 No, cause I want people's tweets on record.
TheStalwart	721398874032705536	2016-04-16T18:04:29	Everyone should tweet right now whether they think the Juicero will be a disaster or not.

TheStalwart	718507059998814211	2016-04-08T18:33:26	amondalek Yeah, I think you're right that we have very little idea what Trump would actually pursue.
TheStalwart	718506335885791232	2016-04-08T18:30:34	amondalek Yeah, I question the sincerity of Trump's convictions. But on nationalism, militarism, etc. They don't seem that far apart.

TheStalwart	718505374899388417	2016-04-08T18:26:45	Yeah. Only Trump can plausibly commit to being credibly uncredible.  
TheStalwart	718505060234326017	2016-04-08T18:25:30	amondalek I think it's been written. What's your thinking on it?

TheStalwart	718504357021487104	2016-04-08T18:22:42	M_C_Klein I just don't see Trump as a likely hawk in any way.
TheStalwart	718504205074501632	2016-04-08T18:22:06	For one thing, other leaders around the world who fit his ideological profile (like Le Pen) tend not to be monetary policy hawks.

TheStalwart	717004096918708224	2016-04-04T15:01:12	EricaGrieder mckaycoppins Right, exactly. In addition to winning lots of delegates, he's also accumulating loyalists it looks like.

TheStalwart	717003822577614849	2016-04-04T15:00:07	mckaycoppins Right. But does "the establishment" have much sway over delegates coming from the states?
TheStalwart	717003098317787137	2016-04-04T14:57:14	mckaycoppins I still haven't heard a good explanation of how Cruz doesn't just win with his delegates + the scraps on a 2nd or third ballot

TheStalwart	711936818321559552	2016-03-21T15:25:39	This is really good from tracyalloway on what's going on with subprime auto lending and rising delinquencies 
TheStalwart	711910152056774657	2016-03-21T13:39:41	One more big reason the first-time buyers are struggling: fewer choices.  | housing

TheStalwart	711732305316806657	2016-03-21T01:52:59	Chinese shares are liking the relaxation of margin trading curbs  
TheStalwart	711713281388359681	2016-03-21T00:37:23	jeneps yeah. That makes sense
TheStalwart	711711211532849152	2016-03-21T00:29:10	jeneps all things being equal though, the one who's been focused on Cruz has the key up, no? (Has sources, knows the campaign's tactics)
TheStalwart	711710614624677888	2016-03-21T00:26:48	JoeMysak true, though in many fields, it can be good for the reporter when bad news happens. I.E. reporters covering Enron.
TheStalwart	711710196872126464	2016-03-21T00:25:08	TheStalwart it can be totally life changing! in 1989, ron fournier was the AP little rock bureau chief...but then 
TheStalwart	711710194388967425	2016-03-21T00:25:07	If you have two reporters. One who's been focused on Cruz and another on Rubio, Rubio's dropping out hurts the latter's career, right?
TheStalwart	711709617131118592	2016-03-21T00:22:50	That's not accusatory. Just curious if that becomes an issue. Like if you've become the expert on Bernie, his winning would be good for you.
TheStalwart	711709234681909248	2016-03-21T00:21:19	Honest Q: Do journos in the primaries ever get biased towards the candidate they cover most so they become "a star reporter" in the general?

TheStalwart	711628806889426944	2016-03-20T19:01:43	Here's a real question. Why are there any designs (like animals) on infant clothing? The infant has no idea. And it's not an adult aesthetic
TheStalwart	711628560167870464	2016-03-20T19:00:44	jgbos I guess? But it seems to me it implies she's an aggie.

TheStalwart	711280959270703104	2016-03-19T19:59:30	LorcanRK Yeah. Races below the Presidency.
TheStalwart	711280756476121088	2016-03-19T19:58:41	Donald Trump could already be a downballot disaster. And the array of available Senate Seats could really exacerbate it.
TheStalwart	711280567103295489	2016-03-19T19:57:56	Another good chart. There's not a single Democrat-held Senate Seat being contested in a red state this year. 
TheStalwart	711279534499180545	2016-03-19T19:53:50	Jessica_Effect Thanks! THinking I might try for early Tuesday.
