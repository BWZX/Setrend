Shinsei1967	711876568126242816	2016-03-21T11:26:14	liversedge I'm sure you are right. But one of criticisms of BSF was that they favoured architectural bravura over efficient functionality.

Shinsei1967	711866506460729344	2016-03-21T10:46:15	liversedge £3bn pa out of a £1.5trn economy.
Shinsei1967	711864221835862016	2016-03-21T10:37:10	liversedge Not disagreeing with your there. I'm merely saying that investing in those areas won't boost tax revenues in the short term.
Shinsei1967	711863893870645249	2016-03-21T10:35:52	liversedge Capex was cut by a few billion which is pretty insignificant in a £1.5trn economy. There were other reasons for growth slowing.
Shinsei1967	711861983985995776	2016-03-21T10:28:17	liversedge It was because they had run out of useful projects, so diminishing returns and the deficits kept on rising.

Shinsei1967	711855910675718145	2016-03-21T10:04:09	liversedge If it is so obvious that "investing" £10bn would cut deficit by £20bn why doesn't Osborne do it (rather than miss his targets) ?

Shinsei1967	711841549441699840	2016-03-21T09:07:05	liversedge Invest £1bn. Generates £2bn in GDP (&amp; that is punchy multiplier). Tax as %age of GDP is 40%. Get back £800m in tax. Loss - £200m

Shinsei1967	711840133847392256	2016-03-21T09:01:27	liversedge Indeed, so why not just invest more, get more tax and cover that deficit.
