yayitsrob	717768676850552833	2016-04-06T17:39:22	ScienceGroen Thank you for making time!!! I‚Äôm so happy this came together, and right in time for Empires‚Äôs publication.
yayitsrob	717768002456981504	2016-04-06T17:36:41	rcbregman hey thank you!
yayitsrob	717765672269385728	2016-04-06T17:27:26	Invective was not his comparative advantage as a writer; the insults are funny now bc of odd words, reinforcing idea his language is "weird"

yayitsrob	717763441860042753	2016-04-06T17:18:34	yayitsrob Not sure if you saw, but I made a little 5 minute mini-documentary about the last stand of the Russians: 
yayitsrob	717762969925451777	2016-04-06T17:16:42	carolinesinders ScienceGroen no! unless i don‚Äôt know it under his twitter handle, haha. what should i check out? ksheely
yayitsrob	717762678295552000	2016-04-06T17:15:32	Okay that‚Äôs it for me. And I didn‚Äôt even get into ScienceGroen‚Äôs historiography! Go read the full interview here: 
yayitsrob	717762469641388032	2016-04-06T17:14:42	I thought of those while reading about Russians fighting at 4 a.m., and I hope that GreatDismal and ScienceGroen talk about EVE sometime.
yayitsrob	717762111699431424	2016-04-06T17:13:17	I guess it‚Äôs here that GreatDismal closes the loop and says jet lag is a time-travelling disease: 
yayitsrob	717761063828242432	2016-04-06T17:09:07	I kept remembering this GreatDismal story about how globalized video games =&gt; time travel.  
yayitsrob	717760900623564800	2016-04-06T17:08:28	Wait, sorry, one last thing.
yayitsrob	717759824671342592	2016-04-06T17:04:12	EVE is the most real place we‚Äôve ever made online‚Äîand the Internet‚Äôs first networked war.  
yayitsrob	717759219529744384	2016-04-06T17:01:47	I am totally delighted by ScienceGroen‚Äôs provocation that to research EVE is to play EVE.  
yayitsrob	717758912087203840	2016-04-06T17:00:34	Okay two more things, then I‚Äôll stop spamming you all. (Sorry! I‚Äôm sorry!!!!)
yayitsrob	717758710525767681	2016-04-06T16:59:46	This is the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt feed the trolls‚Äù theory of military tactics‚Äîdeny the enemy fun at almost any cost. 
yayitsrob	717757739208941568	2016-04-06T16:55:54	Speaking of 1930s Germany, here‚Äôs one way economics in EVE mirror other conflict economies.  
yayitsrob	717757194935083008	2016-04-06T16:53:45	This quote is *not* from my interview with ScienceGroen, but, I mean.  
yayitsrob	717756304081731585	2016-04-06T16:50:12	But it‚Äôs also that leaders realize that their main resource is their ability to make the game less boring. 
yayitsrob	717755402583150592	2016-04-06T16:46:37	One reason: EVE‚Äôs one-server-for-the-world means that there *is* cultural scarcity. Your language can get wiped out. 
yayitsrob	717754868996435968	2016-04-06T16:44:30	Okay, so, next Q: Why do tens of thousands of people spend so much time in EVE defending their make-believe space teams &amp; fortresses?
yayitsrob	717754350110711809	2016-04-06T16:42:26	And sovereignty also allowed for different philosophies of gameplay. It allowed orgs to master, e.g., logistics. 
yayitsrob	717753991434739712	2016-04-06T16:41:01	And ScienceGroen says: Not really‚Äîpermanent sovereignty is what allowed space armies to form civic institutions. 
yayitsrob	717753008663236609	2016-04-06T16:37:07	I wanted to know: Did sovereignty doom the game to a WWI-style conflict? Was that war baked in as soon as there were local laws &amp; borders?
yayitsrob	717752406101135360	2016-04-06T16:34:43	Two years after ‚Äúsovereignty‚Äù gets introduced, there‚Äôs this massive, years-long WWI-style ‚Äútangle of treaties‚Äù war.
yayitsrob	717752144858890240	2016-04-06T16:33:41	EVE introduces this idea of sovereignty in 2004‚Äîthe game let an organization ‚Äúpermanently‚Äù lay claim to a piece of space.
yayitsrob	717751605370699776	2016-04-06T16:31:32	But it‚Äôs also because that deep, in-game institutional complexity and diversity was allowed to form by the game‚Äôs ‚Äúinternational order.‚Äù
yayitsrob	717751292433719296	2016-04-06T16:30:17	Why is the social world of EVE so complex? One reason: Most of the world has to share a single server. 
yayitsrob	717749695217582080	2016-04-06T16:23:57	[I will not pursue a lengthy side note here about John Boyd, the OODA loop, and why EVE might be a good parallel to 19th century conflict]
yayitsrob	717749383543001088	2016-04-06T16:22:42	You can‚Äôt run the same battle twice and expect the same outcome. Even *planing* a battle is hard. That‚Äôs what makes history history.
yayitsrob	717748940083490818	2016-04-06T16:20:57	I should add: This coheres with Tolstoy‚Äôs writing about the Battle of Borodino &amp; his thinking about historical contingency generally.
yayitsrob	717747939276427265	2016-04-06T16:16:58	Why is EVE the only video game you can write a history of? Because, in EVE, resources are finite &amp; death is forever. 
yayitsrob	717745909287817217	2016-04-06T16:08:54	My chat with ScienceGroen about ONLINE SPACE WAR and HISTORY is super long, so here are some of my favorite parts 
yayitsrob	717745878585446400	2016-04-06T16:08:47	c_s_green I loved that, honestly (but also I just transcribed a long Q&amp;A so I was happy to see affect conveyed in a different way)
yayitsrob	717699314739445762	2016-04-06T13:03:45	How do you write the history of a video game conflict? I talked to ScienceGroen about war &amp; peace in EVE Online:  
yayitsrob	717697335795564544	2016-04-06T12:55:53	I was a day off but now it‚Äôs up!
yayitsrob	717448047865765888	2016-04-05T20:25:18	The extra horrifying thing about Untanned Trump is that the real one immediately starts looking like the photoshop.

yayitsrob	694189671681781760	2016-02-01T16:04:49	FWIW, I think MattBellassai‚Äôs story is hopeful‚Äîit‚Äôs only a week &amp; he already has more followers on FB than Twitter.

yayitsrob	694188287825711104	2016-02-01T15:59:19	_abby_c but part of the problem i think is that we only have experts to turn to on this issue &amp; it evades quant metrics‚Äî ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø indeed
yayitsrob	694187507609669633	2016-02-01T15:56:13	_abby_c she‚Äôs been like, i see this almost only from trump &amp; bernie supporters, which is a bummer, b/c i‚Äôm a bernie supporter
yayitsrob	694187398964600834	2016-02-01T15:55:47	_abby_c i get that. if it helps, the person who drew the connection most clearly‚Äî&amp; wrote the book on online harassment‚Äîis a bern supporter
yayitsrob	694184213294227457	2016-02-01T15:43:08	_abby_c (i think the fact that sanders‚Äôs rapid response guy tweeted abt it helped turn it into A Story.) anyway sorry to fill yr mentions!
yayitsrob	694183979461775360	2016-02-01T15:42:12	_abby_c that it then became a ~*campaign*~ issue is less than ideal‚Ä¶ but then again, that‚Äôs much of our political media
yayitsrob	694183692764368896	2016-02-01T15:41:04	_abby_c ‚Ä¶esp pronounced &amp; bad with the sanders campaign. and then it got attached to the berniebro trope, which is imperfect but workable
yayitsrob	694183391726538753	2016-02-01T15:39:52	_abby_c but this new trope started because a number of women, incl some who research &amp; specialize in online harassment, said it was‚Ä¶
yayitsrob	694183326119235584	2016-02-01T15:39:36	_abby_c yeah so it‚Äôs complicated right? i wrote the 1st story to suggest that some bern supporters should try a diff way of engaging online

yayitsrob	694181006241370112	2016-02-01T15:30:23	_abby_c that some vitriolic online misogyny is associated w/ sanders is, as others have said, a web-harassment story, not a horserace story

yayitsrob	693859371739013121	2016-01-31T18:12:20	The ‚ÄúBerniebro‚Äù of the stormy present is a misogynist troll who attacks visible women online for various perceived but baseless crimes.
yayitsrob	693858899363954688	2016-01-31T18:10:27	The ‚ÄúBerniebro‚Äù of rtraister was a leftistish male who virulently disliked Clinton on arguably anti-woman grounds. 
yayitsrob	693858090601426944	2016-01-31T18:07:14	The ‚ÄúBerniebro‚Äù of my story was a harmless guy who argued on Facebook in an ineffective if fairly specific way. 
yayitsrob	693857271365783552	2016-01-31T18:03:59	The ‚ÄúBerniebro‚Äù story is confusing to follow, and controversial in part, because it has stood in for three different but related ideas.
yayitsrob	693856828732518401	2016-01-31T18:02:13	A Pulitzer winner blogged about a silly word I helped invent, so I will use this opportunity to tweetdrizzle. (It‚Äôs a lesser tweetstorm.)
