realDonaldTrump	688517545293406208	2016-01-17T00:25:49	Interesting read from Peggy Noonan. 
realDonaldTrump	688445495174393856	2016-01-16T19:39:31	Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about &amp; demeaning? 
realDonaldTrump	688443772565348352	2016-01-16T19:32:40	Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions, $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul, &amp; $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite

realDonaldTrump	688426349652910080	2016-01-16T18:23:26	When will TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.
realDonaldTrump	688426156920459264	2016-01-16T18:22:40	Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!
realDonaldTrump	688425749129211905	2016-01-16T18:21:03	If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?
realDonaldTrump	688393139435008000	2016-01-16T16:11:28	Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money, does another for votes.

realDonaldTrump	688352797251792896	2016-01-16T13:31:10	Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!
realDonaldTrump	688335640925061124	2016-01-16T12:23:00	Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?
realDonaldTrump	688334268804804608	2016-01-16T12:17:32	Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.
realDonaldTrump	688333063093374976	2016-01-16T12:12:45	The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!
realDonaldTrump	688328034651361280	2016-01-16T11:52:46	Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!
realDonaldTrump	688327093214662657	2016-01-16T11:49:02	Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable
realDonaldTrump	688324874604023808	2016-01-16T11:40:13	Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so
