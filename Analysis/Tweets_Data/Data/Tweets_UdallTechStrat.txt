UdallTechStrat	708018188638822400	2016-03-10T19:54:25	There's the baby Bobcat.  Or just smaller model. 
UdallTechStrat	708017638455287808	2016-03-10T19:52:13	cjeppen LOL -- I was pretty close to him there, and close enough.  He was a big Bobcat, 25lbs or so.
UdallTechStrat	708016829030133760	2016-03-10T19:49:01	StockCats yeah he's prob. mostly Ragdoll, vs. my early guess of Siamese.  So he might get LARGE...
UdallTechStrat	708016658464411648	2016-03-10T19:48:20	Or he was watching Bobcat number 4 in the hood.

UdallTechStrat	707947987734044672	2016-03-10T15:15:27	CarterMansbach thus better to upgrade under 20 than over 35-40, which most will wait for

UdallTechStrat	707478128327680001	2016-03-09T08:08:24	Hubon well is it worthless or a multi-year low, from commodity bust bubble unwind??
UdallTechStrat	707477665205198848	2016-03-09T08:06:34	Hubon u have to relate debt to output -- GDP or total Rev's or various other measures.  Standalone it's a lark.
UdallTechStrat	707477146122457092	2016-03-09T08:04:30	Hubon that's even more clear.

UdallTechStrat	705076206215925760	2016-03-02T17:04:01	PeterPrudden Perf. ex.  Look at NYMO peaks in late 08 &amp; early 09, then see what market did over months.
UdallTechStrat	705075780531802112	2016-03-02T17:02:20	followtheh here's one good ex...  combo that with NYMO over time... much more informative

UdallTechStrat	705074302563946496	2016-03-02T16:56:28	followtheh there's a ton, market levels, other sentiment and technicals, but NAAR's is a great place to start, esp. the longer ones

UdallTechStrat	705055910234714112	2016-03-02T15:43:22	Thus if GOP loses the White House yet again, it's completely their own fault.

UdallTechStrat	695750764879171584	2016-02-05T23:28:03	space_menagerie anything possible, but LNKD a mini FANG as held up real well esp. with big spike Oct/Nov.  Just like DATA in fact.
UdallTechStrat	695748938817622016	2016-02-05T23:20:48	space_menagerie but it prob. stabilizes and Pops earlier/better before others do
UdallTechStrat	695748731694485504	2016-02-05T23:19:58	space_menagerie CRM wouldn't be my first pick but absolutely.  Buyout or move to intrinsic value is lower than many others.
UdallTechStrat	695695375085101057	2016-02-05T19:47:57	Interesting that NEWR popped almost $2 after I started directly pointing out the Bid Rigging occurring with the stock today.
UdallTechStrat	695668286940295171	2016-02-05T18:00:19	BorisB2 from here I'd say higher... from 75plus tough to rise

UdallTechStrat	695667042825863168	2016-02-05T17:55:22	PCTY big recovery off grossly manipulated lows.  Still a long ways from 37's last night
UdallTechStrat	695660896769560577	2016-02-05T17:30:57	which is supposedly illegal BTW...  but absolutely no one is minding the store.
UdallTechStrat	695660658247888896	2016-02-05T17:30:00	Nope they are bid rigging NEWR stuffing quotes lower simply to generate volume.
UdallTechStrat	695659812340666368	2016-02-05T17:26:38	NEWR tougher call than SPLK 34 but could flip hard as they took out 23 IPO price already.
UdallTechStrat	695659750415945728	2016-02-05T17:26:23	Best Guess is that WDAY likely puts in a pretty solid to darn fine report.  Certainly won't be anything like DATA ...
UdallTechStrat	695659435637678080	2016-02-05T17:25:08	graystoke did U see my fill bud??
UdallTechStrat	695657776580681728	2016-02-05T17:18:33	PCTY was 37-38ish last night after HUGE EPS beat... hit 30-31 earlier today.  Yep markets are functioning properly!!  LMAO
UdallTechStrat	695651345672466432	2016-02-05T16:53:00	that was when the stock was ticking around $38ish... I need to look but I thot IPHI had real strong numbers.
UdallTechStrat	695650250749415424	2016-02-05T16:48:38	Just got filled... SPLK at $34 even.  I put this in for a semi joke earlier today.
UdallTechStrat	695649218178916352	2016-02-05T16:44:32	Perfectly said!

UdallTechStrat	695643893807783936	2016-02-05T16:23:23	TripleDTrader I think man Investment folks lose sight why stocks go public/trade.  It's called capital formation.  Not capital destruction.

UdallTechStrat	695634180659499008	2016-02-05T15:44:47	so SPLK trading about 5X Fwd sales now...  umm that's less than GOOGL with 3-4X GOOG's growth.  Move along nothing to see here
UdallTechStrat	695633153981968386	2016-02-05T15:40:42	nonsense713 Not really

UdallTechStrat	695623330217394176	2016-02-05T15:01:40	SPLK low $38 oh thank U!!
UdallTechStrat	695623328405389312	2016-02-05T15:01:40	NEWR taking some here low/mid 24's... totally retarded.  Might keep for days/weeks or QTR's.
UdallTechStrat	695615643287212032	2016-02-05T14:31:07	best inter. trade off DATA might be QLIK
UdallTechStrat	695613420213669888	2016-02-05T14:22:17	Brissbrass space_menagerie that is def. not what I said, ur mis quoting me now.  Easy on that!!
UdallTechStrat	695613229473484801	2016-02-05T14:21:32	Brissbrass again go dig into it...  also as I said, it reduces 100's (or more) of added rules, reg's &amp; trading procedures
UdallTechStrat	695612752774103040	2016-02-05T14:19:38	Brissbrass too many reasons to list... but mainly it's that those who have EDGE can use that edge vs. machines.
UdallTechStrat	695611060502470656	2016-02-05T14:12:55	space_menagerie at margin bullish, but DATA &amp; LNKD are drivers
UdallTechStrat	695610928209854466	2016-02-05T14:12:23	Brissbrass I'll say this, everyone I've turned onto this who's truly researched it has come to my view.  Leon Cooperman agrees with me.
UdallTechStrat	695610623183310849	2016-02-05T14:11:11	Brissbrass space_menagerie the FACT they have had to implement literally 100's/1000's of trading rules since ELIM. should tell U ur answer
UdallTechStrat	695610467784327169	2016-02-05T14:10:33	Brissbrass space_menagerie go research it... I've given U plenty to go on, U are only scratching surface of the implications.
UdallTechStrat	695609855327928320	2016-02-05T14:08:07	Brissbrass space_menagerie Nick go look at how many 100's or even 1000's of "Rules" have been put in place since Uptick Elim.  LMAO
UdallTechStrat	695609613148778496	2016-02-05T14:07:10	Brissbrass space_menagerie Nick, that statement completely shows how little U understand about the rule
UdallTechStrat	695609104128081920	2016-02-05T14:05:08	that's a great point too!!  There are literally 100's of them.   
UdallTechStrat	695608728599420928	2016-02-05T14:03:39	Brissbrass space_menagerie Yeah that's a totally ignorant and naive statement.
UdallTechStrat	695608563431903232	2016-02-05T14:02:59	Brissbrass space_menagerie well agree to disagree.  But u don't understand it at all.  As Uptick reduced regulations and many other rules.
UdallTechStrat	695606169893625857	2016-02-05T13:53:29	space_menagerie I agreed...  it can now sorta grind higher.
UdallTechStrat	695604428527706112	2016-02-05T13:46:34	space_menagerie It's purely a profit center for the MM's Algo's and HFT's.
UdallTechStrat	695604320188772352	2016-02-05T13:46:08	It's the same as why is "Naked Short Selling" allowed even for market makers.  No reason for it for market function. 
UdallTechStrat	695603290038349824	2016-02-05T13:42:02	During 77 YRS of Uptick Rule stocks and market still dropped 50% with regularity.   
UdallTechStrat	695603087948455937	2016-02-05T13:41:14	Exactly... because they know it's a total tool that works to their advantage.   
UdallTechStrat	695600914095210497	2016-02-05T13:32:36	Brissbrass if ur saying supply/demand and know nothing of the UPtick Rule then U need to go research it.

UdallTechStrat	695353917253660672	2016-02-04T21:11:07	DATA down nearly $22...  it's high time that SPLK gets the prem. over DATA vs. inverse over the last 6 QTR's or so 
UdallTechStrat	695353592388038658	2016-02-04T21:09:50	DATA to reiterate...

UdallTechStrat	685238985057148929	2016-01-07T23:17:59	Yup just tweeted something quite similar.  Tho I'm using 14% and 10% vs. each consensus.  non-AAPL mobile even worse 
UdallTechStrat	685237588001566720	2016-01-07T23:12:26	mdsmaldon Mark I did note CRUS #'s down 10% vs. 14% for QRVO.  Implies AAPL stronger vs other mobile.  Partly why mentioned that 30%
UdallTechStrat	685235769804324864	2016-01-07T23:05:13	mdsmaldon I'd lay odds at 4/1 that ur right.  Now trying to calibrate where the prem. will sit at on QRVO
UdallTechStrat	685234021115166720	2016-01-07T22:58:16	that might have been true b4 AH's news...  Oh lordy tough market to pre-Negative 
UdallTechStrat	685232702065254400	2016-01-07T22:53:01	mdsmaldon no that's what suppliers are saying...  as orders for Q1 end up being the Q2 sell thru.  The suppliers are in essence 1 QTR frwd.
UdallTechStrat	685232105115095040	2016-01-07T22:50:39	UdallTechStrat well now we have evidence... and it's not 30% cuts... looks like about 15% cuts based on CRUS &amp; QRVO
UdallTechStrat	685183857465806848	2016-01-07T19:38:56	BPGAG StockTwits prob. is that 2012/13 AAPL wasn't fighting a rolling market crash... TWTR has been since July
UdallTechStrat	685183340337467392	2016-01-07T19:36:53	PeterPrudden twistedmarkets as now something like 1885-1850ish feels in "Machines" cards -- thot 1950-55 would hold today
UdallTechStrat	685182945464696832	2016-01-07T19:35:18	PeterPrudden twistedmarkets Gents I felt better about market at EOD Yest. than right now.  Feels like machines can do anything they want +
UdallTechStrat	685166152264187904	2016-01-07T18:28:35	well there's 476 Nasdaqs off the early Dec. highs...  COMPQ almost filled the early Oct. gap
UdallTechStrat	685133978970357760	2016-01-07T16:20:44	HenryPetzold so down day but higher "open" candle ur saying right?  Is so, I concur Dr.
UdallTechStrat	685117860000104449	2016-01-07T15:16:41	the XVG (value line geo) is down 18% from 2015 highs...  much better gauge of "Average" stock + back to early 2013 levels
UdallTechStrat	685112063782301696	2016-01-07T14:53:39	neilweil won't get blowout... tho something close to an affirm is poss. and that would shock the Bears.
UdallTechStrat	685103734133665792	2016-01-07T14:20:33	neilweil in theory this could go on until AAPL ER confirms or refutes the rumors.
UdallTechStrat	685092399844990976	2016-01-07T13:35:31	neilweil sorta... market crash conditions take everything down

UdallTechStrat	684851878975295488	2016-01-06T21:39:46	HFTAlert Ok which direction?  ;))
UdallTechStrat	684850605962084352	2016-01-06T21:34:43	PeterPrudden many don't realize that sometimes the BEST turns occur off a lowish but HIGHER NYMO NAMO vs. -100 type puke lows
UdallTechStrat	684850036098777089	2016-01-06T21:32:27	mdsmaldon that's not true... if U R really seeing it, even if a Q ahead its disclose-able
UdallTechStrat	684849829994868738	2016-01-06T21:31:38	HFTAlert that would be 750 SPX points...  really??
UdallTechStrat	684849498116374530	2016-01-06T21:30:18	PeterPrudden Clarify??  And what does that tell U??

UdallTechStrat	684844764659752960	2016-01-06T21:11:30	Don't let light today's light volume delude you. Bear markets start on light volume!
UdallTechStrat	684844759366504448	2016-01-06T21:11:29	Jon -- and what were "they" saying?  The first cut doesn't matter!!   
UdallTechStrat	684842301529534465	2016-01-06T21:01:43	JohnnyTrades1 we can talk BS supply chain rumors all we want... but until the stock "DOESN'T" drop on Bad news, it's not terra firma.
UdallTechStrat	684836645040869376	2016-01-06T20:39:14	well if we go full ugly this year... here's where we go.  SPX -- not my view but feeling like it every hour

UdallTechStrat	684801464976277505	2016-01-06T18:19:26	traderjourney yep or break below that 150ema finally...  it's like opposite of VRNS upside resistance
UdallTechStrat	684801162399240192	2016-01-06T18:18:14	vaheelfan Yep look at NFLX I just posted too... simply stunning
UdallTechStrat	684801118086369280	2016-01-06T18:18:04	NFLX -- potential short setup presser, getting close to top end of recent range &amp; how many times does 150 hold? 
UdallTechStrat	684794080589561856	2016-01-06T17:50:06	uncanny the resistance on the 150ema for VRNS 
UdallTechStrat	684784867477852160	2016-01-06T17:13:29	Should not could... the Q is, will it matter?   
UdallTechStrat	684782327961014272	2016-01-06T17:03:24	well got 70c on FIT ... looking again
UdallTechStrat	684778127889842176	2016-01-06T16:46:42	Still 72% of all stocks below the 50 and 200sma's -- and peeps are still saying BULL market.  We've been in BEAR for Q's now.
UdallTechStrat	684777376891318273	2016-01-06T16:43:43	Amazing that MS doesn't get it re: TWTR and +140
UdallTechStrat	684766733169627136	2016-01-06T16:01:26	VRNS nice 40c off lows, still seeing a 23-25 stock min.
UdallTechStrat	684759970751983616	2016-01-06T15:34:33	HDP back to buy level, tho I prefer VRNS at the moment
UdallTechStrat	684759743177428992	2016-01-06T15:33:39	sorry fast markets... got FIT at 23 even...  thinking could see 25-26 fast
UdallTechStrat	684759421499527168	2016-01-06T15:32:22	fuzzyedge OH wow... Ok, I'll take it as I think we get at least one more Hike.  And 50bps is all she wrote.
UdallTechStrat	684758892081893377	2016-01-06T15:30:16	Precisely... anyone critical of increasing Tweet length doesn't understand what Advertisers pay for.  sacca 
UdallTechStrat	684756540755066880	2016-01-06T15:20:56	fuzzyedge lol.  Seriousness now...  I'd be shocked if they go above 50bps.
UdallTechStrat	684756344453238784	2016-01-06T15:20:09	Benzinga to clarify TWTR increasing length of tweets is a net but minor positive.
UdallTechStrat	684727798351708160	2016-01-06T13:26:43	Does Twitter's 10,000 character limit make you any more likely to invest? TWTR Twitter10k

UdallTechStrat	684554227918581760	2016-01-06T01:57:00	agree those could get better...  
UdallTechStrat	684530824927051776	2016-01-06T00:24:01	maxnrgmax IMO AAPL hasn't overpaid for anything...  so I don't worry they will.  IF u don't trust mgmt U shouldn't own stock.  per Buffet
UdallTechStrat	684513981529116672	2016-01-05T23:17:05	maxnrgmax hate it... ADBE is fully to very over-valued
UdallTechStrat	684504707088252929	2016-01-05T22:40:14	Next... tho CPC Bollingers say we can go either way currently... 
UdallTechStrat	684504093486796800	2016-01-05T22:37:48	BPINFO looking interesting, note sim's now &amp; late 2011 post spike.  Early 2012 ramp caught most wrong footed. 
UdallTechStrat	684474232818941953	2016-01-05T20:39:08	well scored my 2nd clip on FIT -- do I dance with it again, mid/high 24's?  Hmmm.  Acting strangely as hell to say the least.
UdallTechStrat	684464404331560960	2016-01-05T20:00:05	w_biltmore85 Joe why?  Give users the choice.  Just need a Short or Long Form "Button".  I'll love it.

UdallTechStrat	684460725281017856	2016-01-05T19:45:28	I hope TWTR has patented this...  sacca 
UdallTechStrat	684459371749707776	2016-01-05T19:40:05	maxnrgmax Max I just look at AAPL know 80-100B of buyback over last YR w/stock 20-25% lower + buybacks don't increase Revenues!!
UdallTechStrat	684458040846766080	2016-01-05T19:34:48	maxnrgmax depends on deal... they could do deals immediately accretive.  AAPL needs infusion of Buffetology vs. Icahnology
UdallTechStrat	684457637941923840	2016-01-05T19:33:12	Well so far only 1 supplier has cut production.  Dialog Semi and they lost partial socket to TXN 
UdallTechStrat	684456884930129920	2016-01-05T19:30:12	maxnrgmax it's not about ONE deal, it's about adopting a process and strategy of properly investing free cash flow
UdallTechStrat	684456652343398400	2016-01-05T19:29:17	maxnrgmax I'd say ur with consensus... totally disagree on M&amp;A.  AAPL going BRK.A is the ONLY way to mass outperformance
UdallTechStrat	684455330734981120	2016-01-05T19:24:02	starting to think AAPL bottom will coincide with Dan Ives downgrade of the name...  marketfeel
UdallTechStrat	684453538181722112	2016-01-05T19:16:54	CarterMansbach space_menagerie it's bid rigging, bid pulling, bid cancelling...  
UdallTechStrat	684452903109578752	2016-01-05T19:14:23	space_menagerie I think the term "rapid bid rigging" is more accurate BTW.
UdallTechStrat	684452590315122688	2016-01-05T19:13:08	Isn't that a daily occurrance??  sacca 
UdallTechStrat	684448871431274496	2016-01-05T18:58:22	JohnnyTrades1 FANG is rallying now... ugly manipulated tape on everything else now
UdallTechStrat	684448046688546817	2016-01-05T18:55:05	space_menagerie also note bounce in FANG... a stronger AAPL would compress FANG bounce potential
UdallTechStrat	684447857164722176	2016-01-05T18:54:20	feels like plant... esp. as it's BAD but just at edge of being possible.  Had they said 35-40% would write it off 
UdallTechStrat	684433058183827457	2016-01-05T17:55:31	Commented on StockTwits: I'd say NO.  100B Mcap co in future. 
UdallTechStrat	684432830420549632	2016-01-05T17:54:37	so FIT down big on their own Watch not looking good?  Do any wearables look great?  The fitness types favor function over fashion IMO
UdallTechStrat	684432290517090305	2016-01-05T17:52:28	further if TWTR does it right there could/should be User Monetization Opps for long form posts as well.
UdallTechStrat	684432120521990144	2016-01-05T17:51:48	contrary to most others... I like TWTR allowing longer posts.  Caveat being, U have to click Button to "add or read" the longer post  ++
UdallTechStrat	684430713970540544	2016-01-05T17:46:12	Super1NYC LOL, yeah tho I'd like to have the first buy back!!  FIT
UdallTechStrat	684426965525217280	2016-01-05T17:31:19	space_menagerie so should we believe this one??     re: AAPL
UdallTechStrat	684425463305912321	2016-01-05T17:25:21	FIT pressed more mid 25's, keeping it pretty small so far, but this seems weird.
UdallTechStrat	684411197664276481	2016-01-05T16:28:39	Yeah, that's what's hurting FIT -- which seems pretty dumb ST.  LT we'll see.   
UdallTechStrat	684408503654453249	2016-01-05T16:17:57	FIT plus I generally agree with most of Pecks 10 reasons here...  
UdallTechStrat	684408335156645888	2016-01-05T16:17:17	FIT yet again, grabbing the FIT ... been a pretty good rapid fire trader off big puke lows.  27.55 feels pretty good  ++

UdallTechStrat	682944238871433216	2016-01-01T15:19:29	TradeTexasBig especially as Lucas approved all the plots lines from the books and they all had to properly mesh history.

UdallTechStrat	682288244671688704	2015-12-30T19:52:48	And there's CMRX back to net cash.  Guess knowing how to read a balance sheet and latest ER still matters.  At least for 25% in 2-3 days.
