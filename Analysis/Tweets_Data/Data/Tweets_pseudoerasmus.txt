pseudoerasmus	715580730210971653	2016-03-31T16:45:15	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron which is why the Preston curve looks like this 
pseudoerasmus	715580578435899392	2016-03-31T16:44:39	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron anyway as Cuba, Kerala &amp; communist countries have shown, you do not need high income to have high HDI
pseudoerasmus	715576509403172864	2016-03-31T16:28:29	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron how does that paper contradict what I said about mortality improvement from public health/sanitation??
pseudoerasmus	715572812161925120	2016-03-31T16:13:47	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron so for rest of the world I hypothesise, lagged/imperfect diffusion of institutional best practises
pseudoerasmus	715572472788226049	2016-03-31T16:12:26	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron for USA/Euro it's clear: decline in disease-related mortality due to public health/sanitation measures
pseudoerasmus	715571011857620992	2016-03-31T16:06:38	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron not for USA infant mortality
pseudoerasmus	715569759119675393	2016-03-31T16:01:39	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron 
pseudoerasmus	715569415740325888	2016-03-31T16:00:18	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron from Robert Gordon's book, for the USA 
pseudoerasmus	715568989414506496	2016-03-31T15:58:36	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron lagged diffusion of public health practises from the West; USA, UK hdi improvements start ~1870
pseudoerasmus	715567588152049664	2016-03-31T15:53:02	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron i.e., fairly inexpensive investments from a financial outlay pov but institutionally difficult to do
pseudoerasmus	715567471277817856	2016-03-31T15:52:34	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron underrated factors: piped water system, sewage system, immunisations etc.
pseudoerasmus	715567301614047234	2016-03-31T15:51:53	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron sure but I don't find that terribly mysterious; partly more/better nutrition; but underrated factors +
pseudoerasmus	715566278187098112	2016-03-31T15:47:49	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron for me the most interesting thing about this is that the rank order of the regions doesn't change
pseudoerasmus	715566086708703232	2016-03-31T15:47:04	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron 
pseudoerasmus	715565550773149696	2016-03-31T15:44:56	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron ??? initial conditions don't matter to the later period ???
pseudoerasmus	715565150695243777	2016-03-31T15:43:21	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron Latin America in 1870 the most advanced non-Euro region in terms of HDI
pseudoerasmus	715564879629918208	2016-03-31T15:42:16	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron I am ONLY saying changes in neither GDP nor HDI = strictly a measure of welfare in the utility sense
pseudoerasmus	715564578336325632	2016-03-31T15:41:04	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron LatAm in 1870 already most advanced non-Euro region in terms of HDI
pseudoerasmus	715564180670181377	2016-03-31T15:39:29	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron LatAm HDI progress over 130 years roughly parallel with rest of the world, IMO this is a global phenom
pseudoerasmus	715563820169740288	2016-03-31T15:38:03	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron  LatAm was already the most advanced non-Euro region in 1870
pseudoerasmus	715563381613334528	2016-03-31T15:36:19	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron but it is true, convergence in HDI has been much greater than convergence in GDP/cap
pseudoerasmus	715561699902951424	2016-03-31T15:29:38	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron (of course most people are hyberbolic discounters, but still)
pseudoerasmus	715561508525240321	2016-03-31T15:28:52	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron HDI is just as biased a metric as GDP, since it assumes ppl value extra 10 years at 60 more than a TV
pseudoerasmus	715560983054442498	2016-03-31T15:26:47	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron I don't mean HD, I mean utility.
pseudoerasmus	715559206934458368	2016-03-31T15:19:44	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron WHEREAS gdp/cap differences betw USA and Europe more ambiguous vis a vis welfare; do you disagree?
pseudoerasmus	715558859889381376	2016-03-31T15:18:21	javierarnaut jasonhickel guy_laron $1000 increase in GDP/cap for v. poor country more likely to be welfare improvement than same for rich
pseudoerasmus	715552743197376513	2016-03-31T14:54:02	jasonhickel guy_laron javierarnaut as for your proposal to turn the OECD into Keralas, I will simply say it's politically la-dee-daa
pseudoerasmus	715552430633697282	2016-03-31T14:52:48	jasonhickel guy_laron javierarnaut however, GDP &amp; welfare more likely to coincide, the poorer the country is
pseudoerasmus	715552123107348480	2016-03-31T14:51:35	jasonhickel guy_laron javierarnaut well I certainly agree GDP ≠ measure of welfare &amp; well-being; GDP is just a measure of econ activity
pseudoerasmus	715549396188966912	2016-03-31T14:40:44	jasonhickel guy_laron javierarnaut enclosures; colonialism/resources; Indian famines; and IMF/SAP
pseudoerasmus	715549261526646788	2016-03-31T14:40:12	jasonhickel guy_laron javierarnaut haven't had time but I've meaning to write a response to 4 specific historical claims of yours
pseudoerasmus	715548308928901121	2016-03-31T14:36:25	jasonhickel well, the difference most of those 95% can't back up what they're saying; guy_laron javierarnaut
pseudoerasmus	715546113173012480	2016-03-31T14:27:42	jasonhickel although I do agree with you about the global poverty reduction triumphalist hoopla guy_laron javierarnaut
pseudoerasmus	715545841189195776	2016-03-31T14:26:37	jasonhickel oh btw, I disagree with you nearly on everything in this piece too  guy_laron javierarnaut
pseudoerasmus	715539708080730112	2016-03-31T14:02:15	jasonhickel guy_laron javierarnaut arbenz 1954, i mean
pseudoerasmus	715538931664691202	2016-03-31T13:59:10	jasonhickel guy_laron javierarnaut (if the 63 &amp; 68 interventions are even real, they aren't well documented, unlike Iran 53 or Arbenz 56)
pseudoerasmus	715538675711479810	2016-03-31T13:58:09	jasonhickel guy_laron javierarnaut since Iraq went on to sign a friendship treaty w USSR, you exaggerate the power of such interventions
pseudoerasmus	715535630239985664	2016-03-31T13:46:02	jasonhickel guy_laron javierarnaut on Iraq you do not have elementary facts straight. 68 coup led to rapproachement with USSR
pseudoerasmus	715534895402119173	2016-03-31T13:43:07	jasonhickel guy_laron javierarnaut but in general the comparador theory is mostly nonsense
pseudoerasmus	715534795275702274	2016-03-31T13:42:43	jasonhickel guy_laron javierarnaut I do not deny 'comparadors' exist(ed), but I don't know the specifics of Noriega's rise
pseudoerasmus	715533187250798592	2016-03-31T13:36:20	jasonhickel guy_laron javierarnaut SH was never even an ally, as the Shah or Suharto or Marcos or Pinochet was
pseudoerasmus	715532866873073664	2016-03-31T13:35:04	jasonhickel guy_laron javierarnaut SH was not a 'client', period. He was not 'installed' externally.
pseudoerasmus	715494003337244673	2016-03-31T11:00:38	guy_laron jasonhickel javierarnaut YOUR OWN source (Cooper) argues Saudi Arabia was throwing its new found power &amp; influence around !!!
pseudoerasmus	715493363181559808	2016-03-31T10:58:05	guy_laron jasonhickel javierarnaut sometimes superpower-'client' relationships were reciprocal, true w Soviet-'client' relationships also
pseudoerasmus	715493012839743488	2016-03-31T10:56:42	guy_laron jasonhickel javierarnaut the USA could not convince the Shah the supposed client to relent on the big planed price increase
pseudoerasmus	715492816584093696	2016-03-31T10:55:55	guy_laron jasonhickel javierarnaut also the 77 incident belies the idea that the Shah was a mere 'client' let alone puppet
pseudoerasmus	715492167087759360	2016-03-31T10:53:20	guy_laron jasonhickel javierarnaut +Cooper (author of book you cite) notes Kissinger worried that Saudi was throwing its weight around
pseudoerasmus	715492008991842304	2016-03-31T10:52:42	guy_laron jasonhickel javierarnaut you're subtly spinning the 77 oil war as the USA "letting Saudia checkmate Iran" even though +
pseudoerasmus	715279359381217281	2016-03-30T20:47:43	jasonhickel javierarnaut the Shah, Suharto, the Argentine, Brazilian, Peruvian generals, etc. all of them pretty far from 'neoliberal'
pseudoerasmus	715278908149653504	2016-03-30T20:45:55	jasonhickel javierarnaut it's a false and lurid projection of Chile 1973 to all of the Global South pre-SAP
pseudoerasmus	715276284536954884	2016-03-30T20:35:30	jasonhickel javierarnaut you seem to want it both ways, USA resisted 'developmentalism', but somehow it flourished despite all the coups!
pseudoerasmus	715274919622402048	2016-03-30T20:30:04	jasonhickel javierarnaut I'm not ignoring it. I've said &amp; thought many times, people don't realise the global consequences of Paul Volcker
pseudoerasmus	715273313392660480	2016-03-30T20:23:41	jasonhickel javierarnaut it's more plausible that Europe retarded South development, than colonialism was important to Euro industrial rev
pseudoerasmus	715273065639387138	2016-03-30T20:22:42	jasonhickel javierarnaut actually there's not much data in Pomeranz, certainly nothing which makes that claim 'clear'
pseudoerasmus	715272315324534784	2016-03-30T20:19:43	jasonhickel javierarnaut it was not prevented. many african countries pursued import substitution. Nigeria had steel mills in 60/70s
pseudoerasmus	715270692959338496	2016-03-30T20:13:16	jasonhickel javierarnaut so your view is that, had the 'scramble for africa', not taken place, Africa wd have had an Industrial Revolution
pseudoerasmus	715270402658996225	2016-03-30T20:12:07	javierarnaut jasonhickel my full thoughts here  though I was addressing a slightly different argument
pseudoerasmus	715270309549576192	2016-03-30T20:11:45	jasonhickel javierarnaut (a) African debt was mostly balance of payments related; (b) US Fed raised rates in 79-81 for domestic reasons
pseudoerasmus	715269592214536192	2016-03-30T20:08:54	jasonhickel javierarnaut why did USA not care Japan or SKorea closed their econ to US goods &amp; investment? B/c strategic objectives primary
pseudoerasmus	715269302870536192	2016-03-30T20:07:45	jasonhickel javierarnaut US support of Israel. how does that sort with US econ interest ? Easier to be neutral or pro-Arab, like France
pseudoerasmus	715269017355821056	2016-03-30T20:06:37	jasonhickel javierarnaut not really. SSA commodity dependence not externally imposed; inability to manage macro imbalances not external
pseudoerasmus	715268411668963329	2016-03-30T20:04:13	jasonhickel javierarnaut most of the 1980s or early 1990s spent in (1) financial crises or (2) civil wars; you get recovery growth ~90/94
pseudoerasmus	715268196379598849	2016-03-30T20:03:21	jasonhickel javierarnaut after 1973-80, Africa experienced commodity price collapse &amp; debt crisis, &amp; many SSA countries had civil wars
pseudoerasmus	715265975701123073	2016-03-30T19:54:32	jasonhickel javierarnaut but I do not see strong economic interest motives in US military/covert interventions since 1939
pseudoerasmus	715265686545776641	2016-03-30T19:53:23	jasonhickel javierarnaut USA does (like all countries) pursue their economic interests, in situations like GATT, climate negotiations, etc
pseudoerasmus	715264165183668224	2016-03-30T19:47:20	jasonhickel javierarnaut it's a pretty piss poor dividend for all the effort....
pseudoerasmus	715263359403364353	2016-03-30T19:44:08	jasonhickel javierarnaut the Malaysian state oil co. appears to control more of Iraq's oil than the USA !!! 
pseudoerasmus	715262744870653952	2016-03-30T19:41:41	jasonhickel javierarnaut but the USA got nothing out of Iraq !
pseudoerasmus	715262397091618817	2016-03-30T19:40:19	javierarnaut jasonhickel almost everyone grew faster in 1950-73 than since 1980 or since 1990
pseudoerasmus	715262264203456513	2016-03-30T19:39:47	javierarnaut jasonhickel but that's MY point. people naively compare 1950-73 with 1990-present growth rates
pseudoerasmus	715261273487884289	2016-03-30T19:35:51	javierarnaut jasonhickel the relatively small US share of K stock more 'visible' b/c US brand names, durables, K goods
pseudoerasmus	715260960135651328	2016-03-30T19:34:36	jasonhickel javierarnaut you think the USA did regime change in Iraq because it did not like Baathist socialism ????
pseudoerasmus	715260527866417153	2016-03-30T19:32:53	jasonhickel javierarnaut even in 1950-73, the fastest growing countries were the poorest
pseudoerasmus	715260328066555905	2016-03-30T19:32:05	jasonhickel javierarnaut post-90 growth was lower but then these countries also richer than they were in 50-73 
pseudoerasmus	715259569207959552	2016-03-30T19:29:04	jasonhickel javierarnaut only you include the 1980s, which were filled with (very fitful) attempts to control inflation &amp; budgets
pseudoerasmus	715231958675156993	2016-03-30T17:39:21	jasonhickel javierarnaut but it's NOT defensible to argue, if it had not been for SAP, the LDCs would have the growth rates of 1950s &amp; 60s
pseudoerasmus	715231739409539073	2016-03-30T17:38:29	jasonhickel javierarnaut but (5) SAP went too far beyond imposing normal macro discipline &amp; was not successful in raising growth rates
pseudoerasmus	715228956513988608	2016-03-30T17:27:26	jasonhickel javierarnaut (3) this caused macro mismanagement in the South (4) which forced them to go to the IMF, but
pseudoerasmus	715228383882452992	2016-03-30T17:25:09	jasonhickel javierarnaut however I do think it is defensible to argue (1) ISI was working OK but (2) oil crisis/commodities boom happened+
pseudoerasmus	715224927515852800	2016-03-30T17:11:25	jasonhickel javierarnaut anyway, ISI, growth slowdown, commodities price collapse, debt crisis, &amp; 80s structural adjustment -all connected
pseudoerasmus	715224273615515648	2016-03-30T17:08:49	jasonhickel javierarnaut pppplease. e.g., Nasser was "explicitly non-aligned" but sent troops to Yemen to support PDRY !
pseudoerasmus	715223264541470720	2016-03-30T17:04:49	jasonhickel javierarnaut (depending on whether the country was a net commodity exporter or no)
pseudoerasmus	715223035641466880	2016-03-30T17:03:54	jasonhickel javierarnaut no, growth was slowing down before 1973; growth absolutely collapsed some time between 1973 and 1980
pseudoerasmus	715222769588379648	2016-03-30T17:02:51	jasonhickel javierarnaut I'm saying during the cold war, cold war orientation of the country was primary
pseudoerasmus	715222633441271808	2016-03-30T17:02:18	jasonhickel javierarnaut no, your point is that the USA cared first &amp; foremost about the internal political econ of a country in the south
pseudoerasmus	715221979574439936	2016-03-30T16:59:42	jasonhickel javierarnaut right; so it's not the internal political economy, but the orientation in the Cold War
pseudoerasmus	715221472638275584	2016-03-30T16:57:41	jasonhickel javierarnaut overthrow Mossadesh was a Brit initiative, made possible only w US help; USA did not care re Shah's nationalisati
pseudoerasmus	715221176860205057	2016-03-30T16:56:31	jasonhickel javierarnaut no, I'm saying the Shah was not overthrown for nationalising AIOC ! which is quite telling
pseudoerasmus	715220450385797120	2016-03-30T16:53:38	jasonhickel javierarnaut i.e. land reform, oil nationalisation, domestic industrial promotion &amp; protection, etc.; only difference: pro-USA
pseudoerasmus	715220278427697152	2016-03-30T16:52:57	jasonhickel javierarnaut I'm saying Shah pursued policies which were rather like what people like you imagine Mossdegh's might have been !
pseudoerasmus	715220076354514944	2016-03-30T16:52:09	jasonhickel javierarnaut + also to finance consumption &amp; balance of payments deficits
pseudoerasmus	715219943009206272	2016-03-30T16:51:37	jasonhickel javierarnaut wrong wrong wrong. growth slowed over time; cheap debt was accumulated as part of domestic investment boom +
pseudoerasmus	715203532203360256	2016-03-30T15:46:24	jasonhickel javierarnaut I find this particularly illuminating 
pseudoerasmus	715203447239352320	2016-03-30T15:46:04	jasonhickel javierarnaut (2) these were deviations from strategic objectives made by administrations usually under congressional pressure
pseudoerasmus	715203281874718721	2016-03-30T15:45:24	jasonhickel javierarnaut (1) I do not deny that US actions in Latin America were often motivated by corporate cronyism, but ....
pseudoerasmus	715202096983883776	2016-03-30T15:40:42	jasonhickel javierarnaut MossadeGH
pseudoerasmus	715201944877445120	2016-03-30T15:40:06	jasonhickel javierarnaut failed, i.e., it was unsustainable, you don't see link between ISI failure, debt crisis, &amp; structural adjust
pseudoerasmus	715201608733364225	2016-03-30T15:38:45	jasonhickel javierarnaut ISI was not 'outlawed', it failed on its own by the 1970s,
pseudoerasmus	715201353409105920	2016-03-30T15:37:45	jasonhickel javierarnaut i.e., you were largely free in your domestic pol-economy arrangements, as long as you were pro-USA in Cold War
pseudoerasmus	715201238212734976	2016-03-30T15:37:17	jasonhickel javierarnaut your model is Arbenz/Guatemala, but mine is Mossadesh/Shah/Iran or Park/SKorea: i.e.,
pseudoerasmus	715201141877948419	2016-03-30T15:36:54	jasonhickel javierarnaut South markets insignificant for the West until recently; western share of South K stock reached nadir ~1950
pseudoerasmus	715197310163091457	2016-03-30T15:21:41	jasonhickel javierarnaut petro$ were recycled thru US, Can, Euro, &amp; Japanese banks; maybe the Japanese navy threatened to blockade Basra?
pseudoerasmus	715196109514272768	2016-03-30T15:16:54	jasonhickel javierarnaut OPEC recycled petro$ because OPEC countries did not have the banking capacity yet
pseudoerasmus	715195562606333953	2016-03-30T15:14:44	jasonhickel javierarnaut the Shah of Iran led OPEC's oil price hikes of 1973-74 !
pseudoerasmus	715195448722595841	2016-03-30T15:14:17	jasonhickel javierarnaut but that does not support your case! Again, many pro-USA regimes restricted US investment / exports !
pseudoerasmus	715195048804134914	2016-03-30T15:12:41	jasonhickel javierarnaut most E. Asia severely restricted US investment and exports, the USA did not care (until the late 1970s)
pseudoerasmus	715194732977209344	2016-03-30T15:11:26	jasonhickel javierarnaut almost all developing countries before the 80s practised either ISI, or export-based industrialisation (E. Asia)

pseudoerasmus	692198218390708224	2016-01-27T04:11:30	Enopoletus only open question (which you don't even address) is whether Brit policy made India more vulernable to famine than pre-colonial
pseudoerasmus	692198140036915201	2016-01-27T04:11:11	Enopoletus no, I will not comment there. This is the correct view: 
pseudoerasmus	692192192392224770	2016-01-27T03:47:33	Enopoletus there's a railroad x rainfall interaction term in the regression in paper; effect is not due to different weather patterns
pseudoerasmus	692191179883036676	2016-01-27T03:43:32	Enopoletus you say "effect of railroads is mixed"; you're totally outright wrong
pseudoerasmus	692189551771656193	2016-01-27T03:37:04	Enopoletus the evidence is the negative correlation in the India-wide sample !
pseudoerasmus	692189389842157568	2016-01-27T03:36:25	Enopoletus the paper controls for rainfall in various ways; the negative association survives;
pseudoerasmus	692178023924264960	2016-01-27T02:51:15	Enopoletus given neg correlation betw famine intensity &amp; rail access, plausible interpretation is: worst 90s districts had less rail access
pseudoerasmus	692177430560247808	2016-01-27T02:48:54	Enopoletus no, it's not. read the paper
pseudoerasmus	692173075677364226	2016-01-27T02:31:35	Enopoletus when in fact correlation between rail access &amp; famine intensity in all districts of British India negative
pseudoerasmus	692172419553988609	2016-01-27T02:28:59	Enopoletus trad view that rail enabled exports based on a few observations of districts simultaneously famine-stricken &amp; still exporting
pseudoerasmus	692172151038873601	2016-01-27T02:27:55	Enopoletus on average, famine intensity was reduced once districts became connected with the rail network 
pseudoerasmus	692171609130532864	2016-01-27T02:25:46	Enopoletus actually you're missing the point; 'severe' famine districts in 1870s more widespread than in 1890s; this is the effect of rail
pseudoerasmus	692156514900021248	2016-01-27T01:25:47	Enopoletus compare 
pseudoerasmus	692117904838520838	2016-01-26T22:52:22	Enopoletus + especially since there was some lag between famine occurrence and official notice of it
pseudoerasmus	692117740333744128	2016-01-26T22:51:42	Enopoletus was not extensive enough to deliver grain in time to affected areas, even if the British govt had been relief-orientated +
pseudoerasmus	692117136605581312	2016-01-26T22:49:18	Enopoletus I don't agree re the railways, while it's true there were no grain exports before rail, it's also true rail coverage before 1900
pseudoerasmus	692039656419020800	2016-01-26T17:41:26	Noahpinion you might have mentioned paul samuelson's late life theoretical case ("act 2") similar to autor findings
