jackclarkSF	681750451952431104	2015-12-29T08:15:48	etangent good point. We should discuss this over beer and microwaved food in SF. : )
jackclarkSF	681749936300519424	2015-12-29T08:13:45	etangent still a pretty big chunk of power: 
jackclarkSF	681748933098520576	2015-12-29T08:09:46	etangent psygnisfive issues of data sharing and centralized versus decentralized capabilities will be issues people care about, surely?
jackclarkSF	681748704185946112	2015-12-29T08:08:52	etangent psygnisfive computers are, what, two orders of magnitude less efficient than brains? Not banning them, but an AI per person=mad.
jackclarkSF	681748380339560448	2015-12-29T08:07:34	etangent psygnisfive ...which is a bad thing. Eg local environment (Earth) suffering from 7bn of us &amp; tragedy of commons right now
jackclarkSF	681747297588363264	2015-12-29T08:03:16	psygnisfive similar - what if each country of 100m+ people ran its own Google Street View-like data collection &amp; didn't share data?
jackclarkSF	681746781735120896	2015-12-29T08:01:13	psygnisfive in fairness, fully distributed AIs -- an agent per person, say -- could lead to massive inefficiency from replicated data, etc
jackclarkSF	681745826541125632	2015-12-29T07:57:25	Billions of AIs competing for resources - computational, data, etc - could lead to tragedy of commons.

jackclarkSF	681309080892342272	2015-12-28T03:01:57	rbhar90 diodesign so it strikes me as odd the article neglects to mention that a significant AI dev group is not skeptical of the idea
jackclarkSF	681308910377156608	2015-12-28T03:01:16	rbhar90 diodesign and DeepMind + ethics stuff is structured on basis they will eventually create superintelligence
jackclarkSF	681308783591723008	2015-12-28T03:00:46	rbhar90 diodesign they're not worried about it but they believe they are working toward it. Eg Demis and Shane Legg and others.
jackclarkSF	681299924449910785	2015-12-28T02:25:34	Piece neglects to mention that many DeepMind researchers assume they are on path to create superintelligence.
