jledbetter	724814291157790720	2016-04-26T04:16:08	CoreyRobin did you need to go that far to make that minor point? PS I asked you for similar: What do you spend? No response...but you (3)

jledbetter	724810300550221828	2016-04-26T04:00:16	CoreyRobin But wherefore? I am contesting the Atlantic piece being dispositive about liberalism. My square footage matters why?
jledbetter	724809785284132864	2016-04-26T03:58:13	CoreyRobin Whence this extremely precise interrogation?

jledbetter	724806255798325248	2016-04-26T03:44:12	CoreyRobin Another response: the economic failures of liberalism are perhaps best discussed on a platform without an East Hampton house.
jledbetter	724805929615642624	2016-04-26T03:42:54	CoreyRobin Possibly more complex than that! But I do feel like too many Americans overspend on housing/space they don't need.
