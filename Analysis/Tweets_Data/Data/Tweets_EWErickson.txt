EWErickson	717921826110836736	2016-04-07T03:47:56	MrSisXian Agreed. They do. But changing it after four decades and telling each candidate in 2016 it would be majority rule is an issue
EWErickson	717921265290514432	2016-04-07T03:45:42	Interestingly, the Democrats used to require two-thirds support until the early 20th century.
EWErickson	717921163205341184	2016-04-07T03:45:18	Every political party in the US with ballot access requires candidates obtain majority support of convention delegates, not a plurality.
EWErickson	717921005214298113	2016-04-07T03:44:40	MrSisXian I think if the party changed its rules after telling every candidate they had to go for 1237, a court probably would intervene.
EWErickson	717920782777769985	2016-04-07T03:43:47	Reince Exactly. Every single political party in the United States requires it. I just got finished reading even the Green Party rules.
EWErickson	717920631560519680	2016-04-07T03:43:11	8.  Trump has to adhere to the majority rule requirements of the GOP and the GOP has to as well. If he can’t get 1237, they can’t reduce it.
EWErickson	717920512677126144	2016-04-07T03:42:43	7.  In other words, Trump went with a party to avoid signature requirements for an independent run.  As a result …
EWErickson	717920352110829568	2016-04-07T03:42:04	6.  There is a commingling of law and rule and scrapping majority requirements would put law and rule on a collision course.
EWErickson	717920186792288257	2016-04-07T03:41:25	5.  The states shape ballot access under their election codes via the rules of parties with ballot access.
EWErickson	717920021536702464	2016-04-07T03:40:46	4. If the party changed that rule after all the votes in the 50 states and territories had ended, there’d be legal implications because…
EWErickson	717919900698812416	2016-04-07T03:40:17	3.  There are legal implications though.  The candidates ran on a rule req. of a majority of 2472 delegates.
EWErickson	717919780808818688	2016-04-07T03:39:48	2. Not that the party would want to change majority rule, but the Trump supporters think a plurality should be okay.
EWErickson	717919673971568645	2016-04-07T03:39:23	1. Given how intertwined party nom. processes are with ballot access laws in all 50 states, the GOP couldn’t really change the 1237 req.
