RonBrownstein	707394757253734401	2016-03-09T02:37:07	Key: If early exit holds MI primary will validate SenSanders team belief he would be more competitive with African Americans outside South

RonBrownstein	706308061657374720	2016-03-06T02:38:59	RonBrownstein loved the tennis analogy. No one has really broken serve yet on either side the whole race. Like Obama in Iowa 08.

RonBrownstein	706271249308262400	2016-03-06T00:12:42	Just about half of GOP primary voters in both 08 and 12 were evangelicals.

RonBrownstein	706267028382945280	2016-03-05T23:55:56	Better question: why do caucuses still exist? 
RonBrownstein	706266911869427712	2016-03-05T23:55:28	Right question is whether it's changing. In 13 states w/exits SenTedCruz 18% or less w/non-evangelicals except TX

RonBrownstein	706259226885275649	2016-03-05T23:24:56	True, but so far no more success at winning voters who are not evangelicals. If that changes, new game for him

RonBrownstein	706221230240694272	2016-03-05T20:53:56	True but his OK R vote and indie vote were ~equal; no state he won that he would have lost with Rs only  
RonBrownstein	706219691317006336	2016-03-05T20:47:49	Idea that realDonaldTrump relies on non-R voters not backed by exits: his Repub/Indie vote converges in most states

RonBrownstein	706216740846440448	2016-03-05T20:36:06	Case can be made SenTedCruz has most at stake today: Kansas, Louisiana, Kentucky among last R states with very big evangelical populations
