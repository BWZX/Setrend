rortybomb	700365302236913668	2016-02-18T17:04:34	elidourado if you are suggesting people at OIRA do CBA in their free time and submit it as a comment, I'm totally on board with that. üëç

rortybomb	700362591126876160	2016-02-18T16:53:48	elidourado more to point: capital benefits depend on other reforms (resolution, OTC derivatives) so difficult to quantify in isolation.
rortybomb	700361805856665600	2016-02-18T16:50:41	elidourado which other regulations are you picturing weakening as a result of higher capital, and how would you quantify that breakeven?
rortybomb	700350304269770752	2016-02-18T16:04:59	elidourado Still hit the three core problems of porting these techniques to financial reform even if you use breakevens, less quant, etc.

rortybomb	684456042575446016	2016-01-05T19:26:51	ddayen jeffspross The claim is that the repeal of GS allowed banks to get involved with MBS through funding. But that was already allowed?
rortybomb	684455624134938624	2016-01-05T19:25:12	ABWashBureau I understand this to not have been prevented by GS - GS mostly changed underwriting, which was mostly already allowed.

rortybomb	681548765635870720	2015-12-28T18:54:22	MattBruenig So CPC adds ~2.5% of GDP to gov using taxes (mostly) on the rich, which seems like a reasonable estimate and lower bound. 1/2

rortybomb	681545026610921472	2015-12-28T18:39:31	e.g. CPC has a scored budget with new programs funded by taxes on the rich; good since rich have most income growth.
