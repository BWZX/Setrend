iyad_elbaghdadi	720791927604518912	2016-04-15T01:52:41	Flashback:

iyad_elbaghdadi	720791158641729536	2016-04-15T01:49:38	weddady Seems like he wanted to claim that just like Arabic is "stuck in time", our culture is also stuck in time. Both false.

iyad_elbaghdadi	720790607078133760	2016-04-15T01:47:27	So this idea that Arabic is "stuck in time" is just incorrect.
iyad_elbaghdadi	720790548483674112	2016-04-15T01:47:13	And that's just the standard Arabic - if you want to talk about dialects then they've diverged a lot more.

iyad_elbaghdadi	720790361078018049	2016-04-15T01:46:28	What happened is that Arabic got standardized, and that standardization gave us a degree of stable intelligibility.
