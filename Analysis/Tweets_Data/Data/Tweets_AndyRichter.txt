AndyRichter	713087189349834752	2016-03-24T19:36:49	LauraJSilverman absolutely. But, if I were to ask myself who I would rather eavesdrop on, men or women, I would definitely say women..
AndyRichter	713086785165746176	2016-03-24T19:35:12	Using voice text, my iPhone spells it "favourite".  Fuckin douche.
AndyRichter	713086197363388417	2016-03-24T19:32:52	LauraJSilverman ... So I can only hope that before I die gender equality will occur and I can become bored w the female perspective, too
AndyRichter	713085782353793024	2016-03-24T19:31:13	LauraJSilverman .. So maybe, for me, the patriarchy is making female voices funnier to me because I am so tired of the male perspective..
AndyRichter	713085580020551681	2016-03-24T19:30:25	LauraJSilverman I do sometimes think about this: my favorite comedy is comedy that is not boring. That I haven't heard before...
AndyRichter	713084957539696640	2016-03-24T19:27:57	LauraJSilverman ..most striking thing it reveals is the absence of funny female voices in other venues.
AndyRichter	713084763884507136	2016-03-24T19:27:10	LauraJSilverman ...it's one of the great things about Twitter. Prob best place for high volume of unfiltered female joke makers...
AndyRichter	713084358135910400	2016-03-24T19:25:34	LauraJSilverman ...I would say that most of my favorite tweeters are women.Don't even think that way until I have a convo like this one..
AndyRichter	713083854492270592	2016-03-24T19:23:34	LauraJSilverman exactly. And as much as it should be unnecessary to say it, and as someone who rarely thinks in these terms...
AndyRichter	713082854700285952	2016-03-24T19:19:35	LauraJSilverman ..then you are just a devotee of sausage parties
AndyRichter	713082700177870848	2016-03-24T19:18:58	LauraJSilverman it is pretty glaring. These lists always are. And if you can't be genderless about comedy on Twitter of all places...

AndyRichter	699453832577814529	2016-02-16T04:42:43	9 There are 339 days until the next president takes office. The Senate has never taken more than 125 days to vote on a SCOTUS nominee. -H

AndyRichter	699452132563533824	2016-02-16T04:35:58	5 And right now, a case from Texas could determine whether the right to abortion will be a reality for all or some. -H
AndyRichter	699451619080073216	2016-02-16T04:33:55	4 Right now, the fundamental principle of "one person, one vote” is at stake in a case before the Supreme Court. -H
AndyRichter	699451069181591552	2016-02-16T04:31:44	3 Right now, millions of families are waiting for SCOTUS to decide on POTUS' executive actions on immigration. -H
AndyRichter	699450470776102912	2016-02-16T04:29:22	2 The need to fill the Supreme Court vacancy is not an occasion for politics as usual. This has real and urgent stakes for Americans now. -H
