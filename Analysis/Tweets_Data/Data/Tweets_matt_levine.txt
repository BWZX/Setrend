matt_levine	723526751289270272	2016-04-22T14:59:54	MorganRicks1 Which is not exactly a defense, but still perhaps interesting.
matt_levine	723526643302715392	2016-04-22T14:59:28	MorganRicks1 It turns out that security selection wasn't the most important part of betting on a CDO collapse ...
matt_levine	723526577166946307	2016-04-22T14:59:13	MorganRicks1 Of course I suspect that even a very different / more fiduciary selection process would've ended in same place (at zero).
matt_levine	723526483919118336	2016-04-22T14:58:50	MorganRicks1 Yeah that is bad. Btw it seems to me that ACA are pretty bad villains here -- they had fiduciary obligations and did badly.
matt_levine	723526317011025921	2016-04-22T14:58:11	MorganRicks1 But I feel like most discussion elides mechanics and suggests that the bad thing was that IKB didn't know Paulson was short.
matt_levine	723526018703699968	2016-04-22T14:56:59	MorganRicks1 ... does in fact not quite understand how the bet was built, and was deceived.
matt_levine	723525943311126528	2016-04-22T14:56:42	MorganRicks1 And so you have a thing where practically the short side makes the bet and the long side takes it, and the long side ...
matt_levine	723525812314578945	2016-04-22T14:56:10	MorganRicks1 It negotiated the contents of the CDO with ACA, while IKB didn't. And it was more interested, so it mostly won.
matt_levine	723525695171862529	2016-04-22T14:55:42	MorganRicks1 Now of course IKB had to agree to be long, and it took ACA on faith. Paulson had to agree to be short, and it didn't.
matt_levine	723525600368058369	2016-04-22T14:55:20	MorganRicks1 ... who is on the other side. Brokers are supposed to keep that confidential. So GS didn't tell anyone Paulson was short.
matt_levine	723525513860530177	2016-04-22T14:54:59	MorganRicks1 The short investor, Paulson, is not part of the deal. In fact it is generally pretty dicey for a broker to tell one side ...
matt_levine	723525410609336321	2016-04-22T14:54:34	MorganRicks1 The thing was a thing, a CDO, with a manager. The manager is part of the thing, so you disclose it.
matt_levine	723525344473563136	2016-04-22T14:54:19	MorganRicks1 I suspect it's like this. ACA was the manager. It "selected" them, in that it gave final signoff.
matt_levine	723524021615087617	2016-04-22T14:49:03	MorganRicks1 I mean look it's not great. But *some portion* of the outrage seems to come from not recognizing it's a bet.
matt_levine	723523767679483905	2016-04-22T14:48:03	MorganRicks1 Yeah but it's a bet. Both sides need to agree on what they're betting on! You can't have unilateral selection by either.

matt_levine	722452719257169920	2016-04-19T15:52:05	MylesUdland dashbot Like my guess is that most Wharton grads don't work at firms that hire tons of undergrad business majors.
matt_levine	722452337609031681	2016-04-19T15:50:34	MylesUdland dashbot yeah I oversimplified but first sentence of para. 2 is key. (also more hiring = more weight prob. biases agst Wharton)
matt_levine	722451261698809857	2016-04-19T15:46:17	MylesUdland dashbot ... thinks Nova is better, then Nova will outrank Wharton. Or that's how I read it.
matt_levine	722451178680893440	2016-04-19T15:45:58	MylesUdland dashbot i.e. if employer 1 hires only Wharton and NYU and thinks NYU is better, and emp 2 hires only Nova and Indiana and ...

matt_levine	721070386054590464	2016-04-15T20:19:11	steverousseau guan noahmccormack idk i'm in a pretty solid one about imputed rent
matt_levine	721069484283400192	2016-04-15T20:15:36	callieabost georgepearkes ah the old pennies/steamroller arb
matt_levine	721069194188627968	2016-04-15T20:14:27	noahmccormack guan steverousseau I usually do my taxes in February because the deadline is arbitrary but my discount rate is positive
matt_levine	721068580129894400	2016-04-15T20:12:00	noahmccormack guan steverousseau so then answer to "why rush" is "to get my money sooner" right?
matt_levine	721065648760233984	2016-04-15T20:00:22	callieabost georgepearkes nah we're well past the part where straight thinking is required, come on in
matt_levine	721065120911269888	2016-04-15T19:58:16	georgepearkes callieabost I mean what are definitions
matt_levine	721064990640377856	2016-04-15T19:57:45	georgepearkes callieabost then it looks like an arb -- target/acquirer or target/merger price should converge.
matt_levine	721064899598790657	2016-04-15T19:57:23	georgepearkes callieabost Merger arb is weird bc the possible future event is particularly risky (thus "risk arb"). But if you ignore that
matt_levine	721064798578982913	2016-04-15T19:56:59	georgepearkes callieabost I think an arb is like: 1 There is a possible future event 2 Define that event as true 3 Do 2 things converge?
matt_levine	721063411031896064	2016-04-15T19:51:28	georgepearkes callieabost Merger at least sort of looks like an arb.
matt_levine	721063359647465473	2016-04-15T19:51:16	georgepearkes callieabost It's just like "oh hey this thing looks pretty [rich][cheap] to what historical data says."
matt_levine	721063258963251201	2016-04-15T19:50:52	georgepearkes callieabost Implied/realized is (1) not "risk-free" and (2) doesn't involve buying/selling comparable instruments.
matt_levine	721061888155631617	2016-04-15T19:45:25	callieabost no i mean people "arb" everything but implied/realized is like arbing the difference between S&amp;P now and S&amp;P in 3 months.
matt_levine	721061128835624961	2016-04-15T19:42:24	callieabost ~~~that's not an arb~~~
matt_levine	721031669478727681	2016-04-15T17:45:20	jarletta9 I asked my bot to search what the kids are into these days.
matt_levine	721020356597846016	2016-04-15T17:00:23	"Yahoo is exploring many search ideas, like having a bot that is woke af fetch :fire: information on behalf of its users, who are bae."
matt_levine	721019695965605889	2016-04-15T16:57:46	"Using software to fetch information on behalf of users" is just what search is. Is Yahoo's idea just "bots are cool, let's call it a bot"?
matt_levine	721019136772554753	2016-04-15T16:55:32	shaneferro no but like that is just Google search. Or Yahoo search for that matter.
matt_levine	721018933218799616	2016-04-15T16:54:44	Like how is that different from regular search?
matt_levine	721018811953070080	2016-04-15T16:54:15	What does this mean?  
matt_levine	721013495186108417	2016-04-15T16:33:07	jbarro TheStalwart This is also true but makes sense. The pointlessly ugly patterns seem like a market failure.
matt_levine	721012580731498496	2016-04-15T16:29:29	TheStalwart Like I can see better materials costing more, but better/simpler designs are basically free.
matt_levine	721012316947529730	2016-04-15T16:28:26	TheStalwart What I find weird is that there are, like, $10 ties, but they are all ugly in complicated ways.
matt_levine	721010494425939968	2016-04-15T16:21:12	BisphamGreen modestproposal1 but you don't want to suggest that they'll own one in the *next* 15 years too
matt_levine	720997501902417922	2016-04-15T15:29:34	MorganRicks1 rortybomb Oh I agree with that too. Just seems pragmatic in the current state of the world. But, no, not especially legal.
matt_levine	720994780189224960	2016-04-15T15:18:45	rortybomb MorganRicks1 While we're here I tend to hate "stricter"/"less strict" regulatory binaries. It rarely works that way!
matt_levine	720994257562112000	2016-04-15T15:16:41	Is there a Voxier concept than imputed rent? 
matt_levine	720993529170894848	2016-04-15T15:13:47	modestproposal1 I confess my advice is probably bad since the deal is apparently going gangbusters. Still.
matt_levine	720991560251416576	2016-04-15T15:05:57	BenDWalsh actually a little weird to reward them for over-incarcerating but whatever

matt_levine	720990238760439808	2016-04-15T15:00:42	MorganRicks1 rortybomb I don't disagree with you, but do think that *some* calls for simplicity come from a place of wishful ignorance.

matt_levine	719914524850130944	2016-04-12T15:46:12	dashbot shaneferro That is, I think 100 garbage comments and no email is better than 5 garbage emails and no comments.
matt_levine	719914405044031488	2016-04-12T15:45:44	dashbot shaneferro My thesis is it doesn't matter. You could have infinite garbage in the comments &amp; not read them. But you read email.
matt_levine	719913173609029637	2016-04-12T15:40:50	shaneferro But even if they're garbage there's a value in putting the garbage in one easily avoided place. The end.
matt_levine	719913063542059008	2016-04-12T15:40:24	shaneferro Obviously this is not ideal. It would be good to have helpful smart discussion in comments. Some places do.
matt_levine	719912969723846658	2016-04-12T15:40:01	shaneferro And as news orgs get better at hiding comments sections, they get even more valuable. They're a safe place for the crazies.
matt_levine	719912803667206144	2016-04-12T15:39:22	shaneferro The comments section is a convenient distraction for people who would otherwise be doing much worse trolling.
matt_levine	719912663753560066	2016-04-12T15:38:49	shaneferro But if you get rid of the comments and replace them with *emails*, they'll be that much harder to avoid.
matt_levine	719912583684308992	2016-04-12T15:38:29	shaneferro I realize that "don't read the comments" can be insufficient advice to people who get abused in comments.
matt_levine	719912458907959297	2016-04-12T15:38:00	shaneferro If you get rid of comments, you will get more tweets, Geniusings, etc., and most especially more emails.
matt_levine	719912359020642305	2016-04-12T15:37:36	shaneferro People want to say horrible things to online writers. Comments are the easiest way. But email, Twitter, etc. exist.
matt_levine	719912190929694720	2016-04-12T15:36:56	shaneferro Here is a theory (that I propose *very* tentatively as a white man who writes about finance). (1/n)
matt_levine	719892221038895104	2016-04-12T14:17:35	MorganRicks1 There is a widespread belief that "handful" = 5, like, a hand full of fingers, though the etymology seems spurious.

matt_levine	718129266177794048	2016-04-07T17:32:13	BenDWalsh fair enough but that's a HUGE WIN for this genre
matt_levine	718128470610604033	2016-04-07T17:29:04	For "financial regulation explained in gifs by Republican House staff" this is ... not as terrible as it should be?

matt_levine	715922440908632064	2016-04-01T15:23:05	SandrewFinance tracyalloway It's analogous, though. You are paying for massive amounts of immediacy; of course there's a discount.
matt_levine	715909302444273664	2016-04-01T14:30:53	tracyalloway modestproposal1 dsquareddigest But the article was about a study finding underpricing and not mentioning allocation!
matt_levine	715907989106987014	2016-04-01T14:25:40	modestproposal1 tracyalloway dsquareddigest Not that there are no dumb emails. Just, there really is no underpricing conspiracy!
matt_levine	715907926867722244	2016-04-01T14:25:25	modestproposal1 tracyalloway dsquareddigest Right but in FX you have such dumb emails. Seems less likely in bond issuance.
matt_levine	715907672491606016	2016-04-01T14:24:24	modestproposal1 tracyalloway Though I mean, sure, maybe they'll succeed in drumming up some litigation.
matt_levine	715907574084870144	2016-04-01T14:24:01	modestproposal1 tracyalloway Oh yeah but "markets are full of cheaters" is not the same as "there is a bid/ask spread."
matt_levine	715907289320976389	2016-04-01T14:22:53	modestproposal1 tracyalloway Wait are there bond-underpricing cases?
matt_levine	715906368608280578	2016-04-01T14:19:13	tracyalloway I get that these guys seem to be in the business of drumming up litigation, but this is pretty weak.
matt_levine	715906109496799233	2016-04-01T14:18:12	tracyalloway This is not, like, evidence of a massive conspiracy. It's just how markets work.
matt_levine	715905883658649600	2016-04-01T14:17:18	tracyalloway Directionally it'll be smallest in Tsys, wider in repeat-issuer liquid financials, wider still in IG, widest in HY.
matt_levine	715905777756672000	2016-04-01T14:16:52	tracyalloway Like just on first principles if you sell a massive chunk of debt you'll pay a big bid/ask.
matt_levine	715905547204222976	2016-04-01T14:15:57	tracyalloway It does seem kind of dumb doesn't it?

matt_levine	715889488954855430	2016-04-01T13:12:09	So far, so complicated, for this newsletter. But the real logistical feat is behind the scenes. 
matt_levine	715862446599225346	2016-04-01T11:24:42	Someone should draft a comment letter from Finance Twitter on the DOL fiduciary rule. 
matt_levine	715852266377445376	2016-04-01T10:44:14	georgepearkes right but like if an egg tweets "should I buy VRX" and you reply "no!" that might fit.
matt_levine	715848660748279808	2016-04-01T10:29:55	georgepearkes I think even Cramer thing is a stretch, and uncompensated tweeters making general statements prob fine. (Not legal advice!)
matt_levine	715663585175846912	2016-03-31T22:14:29	MattZeitlin M_C_Klein RICO is also kinda BS though
matt_levine	715662689616457733	2016-03-31T22:10:56	M_C_Klein Maybe; I just think sending murderers to prison for tax evasion sends weird messages.
matt_levine	715660781690494976	2016-03-31T22:03:21	M_C_Klein I hear you, but I do not love "it is hard for prosecutors to prove crimes, so let's do away with that requirement."
matt_levine	715660253732405258	2016-03-31T22:01:15	M_C_Klein Like there are actual laws against murder! We don't need other laws to make the laws against murder superfluous.
matt_levine	715659971195707393	2016-03-31T22:00:08	M_C_Klein I am not a fan of the Capone tax-evasion move! If he's a bad murderer, charge him with murder.

matt_levine	715657172508614657	2016-03-31T21:49:00	parrmenidies Oh yeah but *simultaneously* saying both is something other than that ...
matt_levine	715656410122596352	2016-03-31T21:45:59	parrmenidies I think saying both "we will make $100 next year" and "we will lose $100 next year" bespeaks fraudulent intent.
matt_levine	715655340260503553	2016-03-31T21:41:44	I wrote about, um, securities regulation. 
matt_levine	715640418709467136	2016-03-31T20:42:26	Of course the law requires that every CEO be photographed making pinching-fingers and arms-apart-thissss-big gestures, for times like these.
matt_levine	715640104849637378	2016-03-31T20:41:11	Solid use of the Jeff-Immelt-making-pinching-fingers-gesture photo.

matt_levine	715294191459430400	2016-03-30T21:46:39	felixsalmon Like the Spotify convert is expensive, but everyone realizes that's because it's risky.

matt_levine	712363204215750656	2016-03-22T19:39:57	quantian1 But the "accelerated stock repurchase" is way more popular, which is sort of cash buyback + floating-strike put.
matt_levine	712363087697944576	2016-03-22T19:39:29	quantian1 Or rather, the put premium is paid to the company in the form of extra shares (if ITM), or just in cash back (if OTM). ~3mo puts.

matt_levine	707595979466391552	2016-03-09T15:56:42	KatiaPorzo mdc no of course not but I feel like I popularized him as a financial journalism 10K-follower celebration.
matt_levine	707571765501894656	2016-03-09T14:20:29	KatiaPorzo mdc starting this is my proudest accomplishment. And mazels on 10,000.

matt_levine	707259826439639040	2016-03-08T17:40:57	Fine okay if Trump makes under $500K a year then the "Trump isn't so rich" stuff might have some bite.

matt_levine	707207526698373121	2016-03-08T14:13:08	Chris_arnade Underdiscussed in the opinion but it's madness.

matt_levine	697825145705099264	2016-02-11T16:50:54	jeuasommenulle Zettel314 zatapatique so what's the answer?
matt_levine	697820289363767298	2016-02-11T16:31:36	zatapatique Yes right I think even abstracting from coupons the B vs. D relationship doesn't necessarily give you one surface.
matt_levine	697819838400614400	2016-02-11T16:29:48	Zettel314 zatapatique I say that w/o having any idea of what the model looks like. But y'know fix vol and see who values assets higher.
matt_levine	697819654442631168	2016-02-11T16:29:05	Zettel314 zatapatique Sure but I vaguely think if you do that arbitrarily you can get interesting answers on my question re: panic/buffers
matt_levine	697818695784124416	2016-02-11T16:25:16	zatapatique But I suspect that actual coco pricing is more about coupon deferral options than Merton, so not really. cc georgepearkes
matt_levine	697818558278066176	2016-02-11T16:24:43	zatapatique I think that is of interest in answering questions like "do Cocos spread panic or buffer against it"?
matt_levine	697818447129026561	2016-02-11T16:24:17	zatapatique Like is there a tractable model that spits out "sr. CDS implies asset value of V, volatility S, while coco implies V' and S'."
matt_levine	697818283307900928	2016-02-11T16:23:38	zatapatique B is like value of deposits + secured + senior + a buffer. My question is, can you model coco and senior in some related way?
matt_levine	697818006928433152	2016-02-11T16:22:32	zatapatique Sr. debt is an option struck at, like, value of deposits + secured, call it D. Coco is an option struck at some higher price B.
matt_levine	697817890960121858	2016-02-11T16:22:04	zatapatique So I've been thinking about this a little recently from a slightly different perspective.
