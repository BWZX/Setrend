adamdangelo	699020241137893378	2016-02-14T23:59:47	ilyasu valuations get high, or there is a lot of competition to get in
adamdangelo	699016327978098689	2016-02-14T23:44:14	ilyasu sounds like an unreasonably high bar but lots of companies make it through. so far I've done 7 investments that fit the pattern.

adamdangelo	666051507440082944	2015-11-16T00:33:48	rajatsuri yeah, it feels awesome, a nice change from the usual boring weather around here
adamdangelo	666047205027934208	2015-11-16T00:16:42	I love how windy it is outside today.
adamdangelo	665764360111833088	2015-11-15T05:32:47	KevinSimler yeah, I think in all cases the benefit of the signal needs to be greater than the amount by which it makes life harder
adamdangelo	665763574942269440	2015-11-15T05:29:40	KevinSimler yeah. I think the only way to get a mostly honest signal is to have everyone waste a lot of resources making the sign
adamdangelo	665763055083483136	2015-11-15T05:27:36	KevinSimler I think the "handicap" is the cost of having to produce the sign and carry it, which turns out to be expensive but worth it.
adamdangelo	665762662819627008	2015-11-15T05:26:02	KevinSimler doesn't have to be expensive to produce an honest number as long as it's expensive to fake
adamdangelo	665762478521880576	2015-11-15T05:25:18	KevinSimler I'm not sure about the terms. But I think of it like a fitness score number on a sign they have to carry around and can't fake.
adamdangelo	665759627510845442	2015-11-15T05:13:59	KevinSimler I think you can view the tail as a signal that is hard to fake more than expensive. It carries information beyond the handicap.
adamdangelo	660252065864663041	2015-10-31T00:28:54	The road to startup failure is paved with excuses for moving slowly.
adamdangelo	655842036013096960	2015-10-18T20:25:00	I'm grateful to be in a market dealing purely with information. None of the friction of supply chains, the FDA, risk of killing people, etc.
