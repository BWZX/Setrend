MickiMaynard	711583058751791104	2016-03-20T15:59:56	8) All of us fascinated by Cuba will weep a little today, for those who didn't get to go home. And for all those who now can, besos.
MickiMaynard	711582867780927489	2016-03-20T15:59:10	7) That said, Cuba is a once in a generation socio-economic story. I can't wait to go back. I just know it will be bumpy.
MickiMaynard	711582602466086916	2016-03-20T15:58:07	6) Also, Cuba is not a 1950s theme park, for all the photos. Its infrastructure is shaky. A sight for  the eyes, yes. Functional, no.
MickiMaynard	711582388661460992	2016-03-20T15:57:16	5) So it would be a mistake to think Cuba-US relations will change things overnight. Cuba govt will try to keep tight control.
MickiMaynard	711582097597661186	2016-03-20T15:56:07	4) But Europeans, Canadians, the Chinese have been in Cuba all this time. They got some of the best real estate. And fed tourism.
MickiMaynard	711581928282071040	2016-03-20T15:55:26	3) Back then, Cuba was crumbling. The Special Period was devastating. When the Soviets left, the economy was in shambles.
MickiMaynard	711581796119539712	2016-03-20T15:54:55	2) The shoot down plus Helms-Burton put a stop to that. But 20 years ago there were Cuba plans in the wind, they said.
MickiMaynard	711581597917716480	2016-03-20T15:54:08	1) A few Cuba thoughts on this historic day. Folks in Havana told me Bill Clinton wanted to be the president to re-open Cuba-US ties.

MickiMaynard	707761604771889152	2016-03-10T02:54:50	2) Eventually, TARP money was used to pay for the industry restructuring. But there was only one specific auto bailout bill, in fall '08.
MickiMaynard	707761238567165958	2016-03-10T02:53:23	1) From what I remember, the Obama Treasury wanted banks to use TARP funds to finance an auto bailout. Banks refused.
