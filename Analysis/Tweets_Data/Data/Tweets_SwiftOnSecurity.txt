SwiftOnSecurity	720011716369592320	2016-04-12T22:12:25	Like, SMB1 and SMB2 aren't even the same protocol. SMB1 is seriously terrible at everything and has no redeeming qualities period ever.

SwiftOnSecurity	720008534012928000	2016-04-12T21:59:46	SwiftOnSecurity some third party storage/SANs may still require/prefer SMB1. Many have to disable SMB signing to accommodate them too.

SwiftOnSecurity	719984167438524416	2016-04-12T20:22:56	If you -must- use SMBv1 because of legacy systems, then those legacy systems are far larger threat surfaces than sadlock could ever be.
