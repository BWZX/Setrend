JonnElledge	726085654434729984	2016-04-29T16:28:04	daveweeden Otto_English A strong EU gave CEE countries a reason not to backslide - though Hungary now seems to have done so

JonnElledge	726033746109984769	2016-04-29T13:01:48	jamieamartin1 TomChivers I disagree, but my point is that the Goldsmith campaign is implying he's dodgy to scare old white voters off.
JonnElledge	726031971042775040	2016-04-29T12:54:45	jamieamartin1 TomChivers Generate enough smoke and people will think "Well there MUST be a fire". I just don't think there is one.
JonnElledge	726031909675884544	2016-04-29T12:54:30	jamieamartin1 TomChivers No, I get that. But this really feels to me like the Clinton email scandal. It's a campaign strategy
JonnElledge	726031713193750528	2016-04-29T12:53:44	jamieamartin1 TomChivers I have worked with some people with pretty appalling politics, or other problems.

JonnElledge	726030779982049286	2016-04-29T12:50:01	jamieamartin1 TomChivers No more than you can grow up in Essex without at some point encountering racists
JonnElledge	726030710457298944	2016-04-29T12:49:45	jamieamartin1 TomChivers My suspicion is that you can't grow up in a British Muslim community without at some point meeting extremists
JonnElledge	726029199765475328	2016-04-29T12:43:44	jamieamartin1 TomChivers I come back to Peter Oborne's point: if Khan is still too iffy, then when *would* you vote for a Muslim?
JonnElledge	726028937524965377	2016-04-29T12:42:42	jamieamartin1 TomChivers He's received death threats for supporting gay marriage!
JonnElledge	726027114999209984	2016-04-29T12:35:27	jamieamartin1 TomChivers Boris has written some pretty racist stuff (not the same as being a racist), and only Labour bring it up
JonnElledge	726026823759327234	2016-04-29T12:34:18	jamieamartin1 TomChivers Also - Goldsmith too has "associated" with extremists. But for some reason we're not bothered about that.
JonnElledge	726026723683266560	2016-04-29T12:33:54	jamieamartin1 TomChivers It's not illegitimate to ask questions. But a lot of the briefing has implied Khan is a threat &amp; that's bullshit

JonnElledge	726007222069813248	2016-04-29T11:16:24	HWWPotts The most striking thing about the polls is that Sadiq Khan is very close to winning *on the first round*

JonnElledge	726006551824207872	2016-04-29T11:13:45	If Zac Goldsmith has actually come out as anti-beer, it's hard to escape the sense that he doesn't even want to win.

JonnElledge	723504520911831040	2016-04-22T13:31:34	RCorbettMEP I think this mucks up a lot of our discussion of the EU. It *isn't* just 28 countries, but nor is it the US; it's sui generis
JonnElledge	723502770830102528	2016-04-22T13:24:37	alexhern I mean it doesn't map on exactly because there are only 28 EU members. So maybe we can be New York AND New Jersey
JonnElledge	723502281241571328	2016-04-22T13:22:40	I mean, we'll be New York or Texas, and that actually works okay for me tbh?

JonnElledge	723492854618832896	2016-04-22T12:45:13	Here's what I learned at the landpolicy conference last week 
JonnElledge	723448862292086784	2016-04-22T09:50:24	Terrible dead-end job going at the NS.

JonnElledge	723488843865985024	2016-04-22T12:29:16	rtrnicholl Because if we leave the EU we absolutely, definitely won't be affected by the collapse of the Euro or the migration crisis? OK.
JonnElledge	723487983735869440	2016-04-22T12:25:51	rtrnicholl I'm not saying there is nothing scary in the future of Europe. I just don't think we get to hide from it by leaving the room.

JonnElledge	723480222272770048	2016-04-22T11:55:01	xtophercook Samfr miss_mcinerney I think the tell was - if your big worry is basic need, there are much quicker ways to plug that gap
JonnElledge	723480056413184000	2016-04-22T11:54:21	xtophercook Samfr miss_mcinerney Oh yes. All the education stuff has been shunted out of my head by housing policy and tube maps.
JonnElledge	723479581559259136	2016-04-22T11:52:28	xtophercook Samfr miss_mcinerney Did I have a thesis? I wonder what it was.

JonnElledge	723478636729348096	2016-04-22T11:48:43	xtophercook Samfr miss_mcinerney But I don't think the expanding capacity was ever in there, because that wasn't on the agenda in 09-10
JonnElledge	723478524263325700	2016-04-22T11:48:16	xtophercook Samfr miss_mcinerney My reading was that there were multiple motivations: competition, parent choice, new types of school etc

JonnElledge	723474089277534209	2016-04-22T11:30:39	Ned_Donovan My big takeaway from the conference was that the UK is unlikely to do that, OR produce a Flint, MI

JonnElledge	719924467087056897	2016-04-12T16:25:43	obotheclown VlaskoSK No, it's not the same as if it takes us from us. As you may recall, that's really my entire point, here.
JonnElledge	719923949677711360	2016-04-12T16:23:39	obotheclown VlaskoSK Nonetheless the idea the state only has "our" (e.g. "your") money is to misunderstand the whole concept of money.
JonnElledge	719923790793326593	2016-04-12T16:23:01	obotheclown VlaskoSK It doesn't create money because for 40 years it's been terrified of inflation + because the bond markets might object

JonnElledge	719859226730958849	2016-04-12T12:06:28	rorymeakin PeteJefferys Okay, let me put it this way: the TPA has an ideological problem with the state. Which weakens its credibility.

JonnElledge	719856682638176258	2016-04-12T11:56:22	rorymeakin PeteJefferys But the result is that you have no way of knowing if this would work. It might. But you don't know.

JonnElledge	717784286141812736	2016-04-06T18:41:24	MrHarryCole mate you delivered a petition for Clarkson on a tank
JonnElledge	718028941605347328	2016-04-07T10:53:34	cia262 I have worked in many companies beset by bureaucracy and bad procedures. But the government was never responsible.
JonnElledge	718028671135662080	2016-04-07T10:52:30	cia262 But that's confirmation bias on my part just as much as I accused you of!
JonnElledge	718028591808782336	2016-04-07T10:52:11	cia262 My instinct is that it's housing and infrastructure: investment going into bricks, not start ups; companies can't hire right staff

JonnElledge	718027586727706624	2016-04-07T10:48:11	rorymeakin My suspicion is that it's the problem ryanavent identified in The Gated City, and it's all bloody house prices again
JonnElledge	718027407807143936	2016-04-07T10:47:28	cia262 I don't know the answer to any of those questions - but neither do you, and anecdote =/= data
JonnElledge	718026820084477954	2016-04-07T10:45:08	cia262 Okay, I'll rephrase: if that's the problem why is our productivity lower than France?
JonnElledge	718026702128066561	2016-04-07T10:44:40	cia262 We're six years into a reforming right-wing government. It's very much not obvious
JonnElledge	718026400394031104	2016-04-07T10:43:28	cia262 It *may* be a factor. But there's some very strong confirmation bias at work here.
JonnElledge	718026224468103169	2016-04-07T10:42:46	cia262 That sounds a lot like a comforting fiction: the right wing equivalent of "salaries are too low"
JonnElledge	718022867645030400	2016-04-07T10:29:26	JonnElledge I think there's a nationalistic element to it as well. It might mean suggesting that other countries are better than us?

JonnElledge	717766293345017857	2016-04-06T17:29:54	This angers me so much. The Scots volunteered to be part of the Empire and then were its most willing participants.

JonnElledge	717763883566542849	2016-04-06T17:20:19	johnb78 That would show a level of wit and competence that the current Labour administration seem incapable of, though
JonnElledge	717763297299324928	2016-04-06T17:18:00	johnb78 I mean, that would have been the rational response
JonnElledge	717763256962646017	2016-04-06T17:17:50	johnb78 I'm just baffled that they didn't delete me altogether in a fit of pique
JonnElledge	717762753210019840	2016-04-06T17:15:50	johnb78 When I wrote that silly piece about the adventures of Adolf Elledge, someone in the Labour party changed his name to "John"

JonnElledge	717342249525387264	2016-04-05T13:24:54	allanholloway PaulFrame85 This is true (the principle was "not liking Brussels"). Nonetheless, he should have been fired for incompetence.

JonnElledge	710804641320144896	2016-03-18T12:26:47	GavinHJackson JoBarrow Possibly so. But age is a factor, too.

JonnElledge	710804381336211456	2016-03-18T12:25:45	kadhimshubber GavinHJackson JoBarrow I think the difficulty is that so much of the change is structural. It's the Piketty thing.

JonnElledge	710461937528774656	2016-03-17T13:45:00	thomasforth RichardBlyth7 DuncanStott It's art, not science
JonnElledge	710461883183198208	2016-03-17T13:44:47	thomasforth RichardBlyth7 DuncanStott I think the problem is that "return" is wildly different depending on the assumptions in the model
JonnElledge	710461058205491201	2016-03-17T13:41:30	thomasforth RichardBlyth7 DuncanStott In terms of levers a govt can pull, it can move itself. But beyond that?
JonnElledge	710460336953036801	2016-03-17T13:38:38	RichardBlyth7 DuncanStott But ultimately nobody really knows how to shift economic activity out of London.
JonnElledge	710460255386398720	2016-03-17T13:38:19	RichardBlyth7 DuncanStott I mean, my reading of the devolution agenda is that it's partly about relieving the pressure on the SE
JonnElledge	710459591147069440	2016-03-17T13:35:40	RichardBlyth7 DuncanStott How would you tackle demand though?
JonnElledge	710459022219059200	2016-03-17T13:33:25	DuncanStott RichardBlyth7 To be fair, Barker was 2004. The economy bascally collapsed before it could be implemented
JonnElledge	710457596696764416	2016-03-17T13:27:45	tickerhacker ?
JonnElledge	710451957207535616	2016-03-17T13:05:20	DuncanStott I think it's worse than that: they felt rising house prices were a good thing, because it fed the boom narrative
JonnElledge	710451434249199616	2016-03-17T13:03:16	DuncanStott I doubt it keeps him awake at night, but I suspect, if forced to think about it, he won't feel great about Generation Rent
JonnElledge	710449417434877952	2016-03-17T12:55:15	Some thoughts on a family which owns 37 homes 
JonnElledge	710445075961139200	2016-03-17T12:38:00	“Blair helped create buy-to-let. Now he is its prophet, its talisman, its patient zero”  
JonnElledge	710444383548678144	2016-03-17T12:35:15	johnnypaige RobynVinter Yes, and what about racism against white people, eh, Johnny?
JonnElledge	710442617616650240	2016-03-17T12:28:14	xtophercook I'm sure there's a clever reason for this but it has eluded me so far.
JonnElledge	710442554605625345	2016-03-17T12:27:59	xtophercook (Just found this while looking for something else) Durham is part of the North East devolution deal. Which is region, not city.
JonnElledge	710439865003982849	2016-03-17T12:17:17	janemerrick23 TomChivers PickardJE That may well be the reason, but it still entirely destroys the point of the line
JonnElledge	710438485350596608	2016-03-17T12:11:48	TomChivers pickardje I mean, you'd think the law of averages alone would mean he'd stumble into doing something right occasionally
JonnElledge	710438125152165889	2016-03-17T12:10:22	TomChivers pickardje HOW CAN ONE MAN BE THIS USELESS.
JonnElledge	710438001051041792	2016-03-17T12:09:53	oh Jeremy. Via pickardje, obviously 
JonnElledge	710427739401035776	2016-03-17T11:29:06	The estate where they filmed Shameless is going solar  
JonnElledge	710427520865275904	2016-03-17T11:28:14	rorymeakin thomasforth The proportion of Londoners who define themselves primarily by that will be much smaller than those in other cities
JonnElledge	710427419866435586	2016-03-17T11:27:50	rorymeakin thomasforth I'm honestly not sure that's it. I just don't think most Londoners think in terms of London/not London
JonnElledge	710426125726588928	2016-03-17T11:22:42	Marie has said she'll block everyone who interacts with this tweet so you know what to do. 
JonnElledge	710420161669566464	2016-03-17T10:59:00	Why are so many people still living on flood plains?  
JonnElledge	710425519007862784	2016-03-17T11:20:17	"The Marie Le Conte story" 
JonnElledge	710425246235533312	2016-03-17T11:19:12	CharlesOJ I don't know, off the top of my head - tobylloyd joesarling any thoughts, lads?
JonnElledge	710424570935828481	2016-03-17T11:16:31	thomasforth rorymeakin Well, yeah, obviously London is aware it gets a pretty sweet deal already
JonnElledge	710424401368502272	2016-03-17T11:15:50	ICYMI - me for the Guardian on the MP/landlord industrial complex  
JonnElledge	710422003052716033	2016-03-17T11:06:19	"I will now explore options for... implementing the CMA’s recommendations" - please don't  
JonnElledge	710423471403175937	2016-03-17T11:12:09	thomasforth rorymeakin I mean it's basically the Tories though, isn't it? Functionally, if not ideologically
JonnElledge	710421702031908865	2016-03-17T11:05:07	Anywhere there are drinks tonight so that's nice. 
JonnElledge	710421521584492546	2016-03-17T11:04:24	rey_z jtemperton My voice is generally thought to be far the most attractive part of me. It's far sexier than my body, face or personality
JonnElledge	710420951872184322	2016-03-17T11:02:08	iainmhepburn I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed.
JonnElledge	710420602704814080	2016-03-17T11:00:45	JonnElledge "I'm Jonn, don't miss this week's CityMetric podcast, where we'll talk about maps and houses again" 
JonnElledge	710410891179610112	2016-03-17T10:22:09	Cliff Michelmore, who died earlier today, makes a startling discovery during the BBC's 1966 live election broadcast 
JonnElledge	710419914134306816	2016-03-17T10:58:01	po8crg I mean it's not "on purpose" exactly, it's just what my personality is like
JonnElledge	710419810245615616	2016-03-17T10:57:36	thomasforth People would just never consider it's an option
JonnElledge	710419772446535680	2016-03-17T10:57:27	thomasforth Because for 150 years or more the dominant strain in people's identity has been nation not city
JonnElledge	710419554913161216	2016-03-17T10:56:35	Today we're gonna re-record the trailer for the CityMetric podcast because four different people have told me I sound incredibly depressing
JonnElledge	710418266502656000	2016-03-17T10:51:28	thomasforth I meant those who came from elsewhere in the UK, though.
JonnElledge	710416005407838208	2016-03-17T10:42:29	WatGraham For 99.999999999% of Scots I'm sure that's true. But there are  always a few, and they tweet...
JonnElledge	710415761253257216	2016-03-17T10:41:31	thomasforth Well for one thing, a large chunk of Londoners are from elsewhere - they're London residents, rather than London born
JonnElledge	710415541207437312	2016-03-17T10:40:38	thomasforth I can only think of one - Singapore - and that's a special case, as it was only part of that country for a few years
JonnElledge	710415480964648960	2016-03-17T10:40:24	thomasforth Because under the nation state system, cities very rarely break away from their country.
JonnElledge	710414672709685248	2016-03-17T10:37:11	thomasforth I think it'd be pretty population in inner London, tbf. Suburbs are a different matter.
JonnElledge	710414038455468033	2016-03-17T10:34:40	PaulFrame85 CityMetric that'd probably be quite good for traffic tbf
JonnElledge	710413778035339264	2016-03-17T10:33:38	PreachyPreach FFS. GavinHJackson literally did it while I was writing that tweet.
JonnElledge	710413656723492864	2016-03-17T10:33:09	PreachyPreach I mean there must be like a 30% chance someone will bring up the Highland Clearances
JonnElledge	710412931738050560	2016-03-17T10:30:16	Looking forward to the seeing the response this gets 
JonnElledge	710411682259050496	2016-03-17T10:25:18	May be in need of a ParPolBro guest for next week's show. Anyone fancy having a chat explaining the Budget2016 with me?
JonnElledge	710408825489264640	2016-03-17T10:13:57	helenlewis NewStatesman georgeeaton stephenkb Hi Helen what's your favourite war
JonnElledge	710408661898829824	2016-03-17T10:13:18	xtophercook jamesrbuk Is there any chance that actually what's going on here is that it's easier to run an academy chain in London?
JonnElledge	710408498463580160	2016-03-17T10:12:39	Employment opportunity related bump.
JonnElledge	710408026684055552	2016-03-17T10:10:46	jamesrbuk And to show everyone that it's still a right wing reforming government so as to win waverers over in June, is my guess.
JonnElledge	710407878520217600	2016-03-17T10:10:11	jamesrbuk I'm trying to think what the third is. Ark, Harris... who? (To be fair I've been out of the sector a while now)
JonnElledge	710407284673925120	2016-03-17T10:07:50	Education White Paper makes it seem "Every School An Academy" is a headline in search of a policy (or rationale) 
JonnElledge	710406121979310081	2016-03-17T10:03:12	The DfE says the Excellence Everywhere strategy has "two distinct parts".  1. Excellence  2. Everywhere
JonnElledge	710380163356229632	2016-03-17T08:20:03	How and why the Shameless estate's going solar 
JonnElledge	710219085750124549	2016-03-16T21:39:59	SimonFParker Okay, what did you get wrong in that tweet? Try again but this time do it properly.
JonnElledge	710213355399749632	2016-03-16T21:17:13	thejimsmith edjeff EddieRobson yeah good idea, Ed needs a straight man
JonnElledge	710209277940654080	2016-03-16T21:01:01	edjeff EddieRobson I mean no that probably wouldn't work if I'm honest
JonnElledge	710208382423146496	2016-03-16T20:57:28	edjeff EddieRobson I genuinely think there might be a market for a podcast in which you get smashed and talk about TNG btw
JonnElledge	710207355573694464	2016-03-16T20:53:23	EddieRobson edjeff It is, but I think Picard is actually abusing his power there. I mean there's meant to be a process, right?
JonnElledge	710207165110358020	2016-03-16T20:52:37	I am currently judging some awards. I am sitting in judgement. I am the law
JonnElledge	710202147279933440	2016-03-16T20:32:41	What did George Osborne’s Budget do for Britain’s cities? Contains English DEVOLUTION MAP  
JonnElledge	710203399501979648	2016-03-16T20:37:40	IamRosieWalker Whereas many private landlords do just think "fuck it, where's my money"
JonnElledge	710203328769163264	2016-03-16T20:37:23	IamRosieWalker Fair point. Also - I do think that most MPs are at least partly motivated by public spirit.
JonnElledge	710201879154790403	2016-03-16T20:31:37	IamRosieWalker How so? I mean, they're more numerous, so...
JonnElledge	710200023313727488	2016-03-16T20:24:15	rey_z AbiWilks I mean that's just not a fair fight
JonnElledge	710199714189336577	2016-03-16T20:23:01	rey_z AbiWilks Good to know you think Abi's cute, thanks
JonnElledge	710198993687592960	2016-03-16T20:20:09	Handy reminder for the evening crowd 
JonnElledge	710198058726858752	2016-03-16T20:16:26	rey_z AbiWilks I mean it mostly just makes me sad that no one thinks I'm cute tbh
JonnElledge	710197085069516800	2016-03-16T20:12:34	rey_z AbiWilks It says five but I can only see four. Wow, I wonder who the locked account might be.
JonnElledge	710196278446198784	2016-03-16T20:09:22	rey_z AbiWilks I've considered it. It's not cute.
JonnElledge	710196213388328960	2016-03-16T20:09:06	rey_z AbiWilks I'll consider it
JonnElledge	710194942061223936	2016-03-16T20:04:03	rey_z AbiWilks You think it's cute when you're randomly mean to me on the internet but it's not cute
JonnElledge	710194821793783808	2016-03-16T20:03:34	PigeonAir Plume_Labs I more meant - why is only one pigeon path shown?
JonnElledge	710110815324610560	2016-03-16T14:29:46	Documents you're not allowed to see: bspeed8 on viability assessments &amp; affordable housing  
JonnElledge	710170371748663296	2016-03-16T18:26:25	tarirawr Ah - I meant East Anglia wasn't a city but my syntax could have been clearer...
JonnElledge	710169254407106560	2016-03-16T18:21:59	johnb78 GO TO BED JOHN
JonnElledge	710169136375209986	2016-03-16T18:21:31	Also this isn't even right: Osborne hasn't funded either scheme, he's funded consultants to write reports about them 
JonnElledge	710168510987632640	2016-03-16T18:19:01	Did you know Andy Burnham is from the north 
JonnElledge	710167898510249984	2016-03-16T18:16:35	Bump, etc.
JonnElledge	710166696980582401	2016-03-16T18:11:49	hughpearman It's what used to be known as "Lincolnshire"
JonnElledge	710161839817170944	2016-03-16T17:52:31	What did George Osborne’s 2016 Budget do for Britain’s cities? (Not a lot, tbh)  
JonnElledge	710165438341185536	2016-03-16T18:06:49	grabthisbook The piece talks about non-English cities, but the devo deals map is England only, yes. Apologies for the confusion.
JonnElledge	710164776018694144	2016-03-16T18:04:11	I think JonnElledge would want this tube stop renamed "Prague Dalek" 
JonnElledge	710164563157786628	2016-03-16T18:03:20	hughpearman The northern bit rebranded "the East Riding of Yorkshire" for ceremonial purposes I think
JonnElledge	710163531405074433	2016-03-16T17:59:14	johnb78 Not Leeds or the Solent cities. Otherwise, yeah, it's all the big ones now.
JonnElledge	710162073502806016	2016-03-16T17:53:27	This is the map I coloured in, just FYI

JonnElledge	710149475369684993	2016-03-16T17:03:23	Also I wrote a thing for the Guardian about the MP/landlord complex  
JonnElledge	710148469361655808	2016-03-16T16:59:23	So there's a job going at a new NS thing, writing about tech and working for me. Spread the word, DM for details  
JonnElledge	710120335975251969	2016-03-16T15:07:36	johnb78 No, for once. Devolution deals.
JonnElledge	710120293189197824	2016-03-16T15:07:25	rey_z You're just jealous.
JonnElledge	710119357075091457	2016-03-16T15:03:42	Just hit me that a large part of my job today is basically just colouring in. It's very soothing
JonnElledge	710115081988743169	2016-03-16T14:46:43	1. It's 28%. 2. 😂 
JonnElledge	710111328304758784	2016-03-16T14:31:48	OBR: Lifetime ISA 'more likely than not to lead to higher demand for the relatively fixed supply of housing in the UK &amp; so to higher prices'
JonnElledge	710110986217332737	2016-03-16T14:30:26	Told Barbara this was really good. She replied, "Aw thanks! Do I get a house now".   Bloody millennials.   
JonnElledge	710105671514103808	2016-03-16T14:09:19	JackO_May I mean, I do basically treat it as a mouthpiece for my views, but not specifically about Europe
JonnElledge	710105260304556032	2016-03-16T14:07:41	JackO_May I'm actually quite in favour of a Eurropean superstate
JonnElledge	710102225713020928	2016-03-16T13:55:38	REMINDER: The one bit of the EU that UKIP really want to keep is the Common Agricultral Policy, which is hilarious 
JonnElledge	710101083998314496	2016-03-16T13:51:06	horton_official GuardianAnushka "jokes"
JonnElledge	710098902477893632	2016-03-16T13:42:26	Sky News presenter Adam Boulton calls tampons a "sin" in his Budget 2016 analysis  
JonnElledge	710097105365430272	2016-03-16T13:35:17	miss_mcinerney Trickle down housing policy. I mean it worked so well in economics.
JonnElledge	710094135554916353	2016-03-16T13:23:29	Feels like a moment to point out that rough sleeping is only the tip of the homelessness iceberg: 
JonnElledge	710093572037603328	2016-03-16T13:21:15	My story about the work of DelftHyperloop is live over at CityMetric:  hyperloop europe technology transport
JonnElledge	710092443060977664	2016-03-16T13:16:45	REMINDER: High Speed 3 not actually that high speed. Budget2016
JonnElledge	710091989463781376	2016-03-16T13:14:57	xtophercook Get the Danes back in, they seemed to know what they were doing.
JonnElledge	710091857494208512	2016-03-16T13:14:26	My favourite Facebook comments are the northerners who reply "NOT EVERYONE LIVES IN MANCHESTER YOU KNOW"
JonnElledge	710091654661799936	2016-03-16T13:13:37	More devolution for the oft forgotten Manchester! Budget2016
JonnElledge	710091225488105472	2016-03-16T13:11:55	Will Stoneybridge finally get a devolution deal?
JonnElledge	710091161596239872	2016-03-16T13:11:40	Did Osborne just announce a new community centre? In his budget statement?
JonnElledge	710090220838981632	2016-03-16T13:07:56	johnb78 I mean a lot of contemporary British politics involves bribing landlords and hoping it'll trickle down. And yet...
JonnElledge	710089463993667584	2016-03-16T13:04:55	THANK GOD IN THIS BUDGET THEY'VE FINALLY DONE SOMETHING NICE FOR LANDLORDS 
JonnElledge	710087819599986689	2016-03-16T12:58:23	This budget is a monumental disaster for Osborne.

JonnElledge	709382910541959168	2016-03-14T14:17:20	as Tosin_Thompson ThisIsEmad NiranjanAjit Fi_Rutherford would (hopefully) tell you, it is great!  
JonnElledge	709378868394795009	2016-03-14T14:01:16	Galloway has lost half his support.  
JonnElledge	709371333809991680	2016-03-14T13:31:20	sophgaston The main question in my mind is would the horse sing the national anthem.
JonnElledge	709370631658332160	2016-03-14T13:28:32	sophgaston to be fair, there are worst candidates for PM

JonnElledge	709367632823259136	2016-03-14T13:16:37	The Houyhnhnm invasion has finally begun!  
JonnElledge	709365344234840065	2016-03-14T13:07:32	What would happen to cities if there were no urbanists? Not a lot, think NotAGateway  
JonnElledge	709366695891226624	2016-03-14T13:12:54	Imagine referring to a fellow student as "The Paki" and then saying "Oh, that refers to Pakistan, its not racist" 
JonnElledge	709365763161911296	2016-03-14T13:09:11	sophgaston What have you got against a well dressed horse
JonnElledge	709364999328813056	2016-03-14T13:06:09	rrwholloway Also I'm the wrong person to make this point to because I think we need a federal Europe and am cool with that
JonnElledge	709364986431275008	2016-03-14T13:06:06	rrwholloway Greece didn't try to leave.
JonnElledge	709363600616460288	2016-03-14T13:00:36	rrwholloway You're seriously comparing a voluntary membership organisation to an empire...?
JonnElledge	709362972225835008	2016-03-14T12:58:06	rrwholloway Yes, because obviously Britain has never promoted its own interests by kicking around a smaller power...
JonnElledge	709362562001977349	2016-03-14T12:56:28	rrwholloway I think they're going to recognise that we need them more than they need us. We're not giving them any reason to play nice.
JonnElledge	709361395905798144	2016-03-14T12:51:50	rrwholloway 140 characters. You know what I mean. They can throw barriers up and it's no skin of their nose. We can't.
JonnElledge	709360852776964097	2016-03-14T12:49:41	rrwholloway The EU economy is not going to collapse if it stops trading with Britain for six months. Ours will. We'll blink first.
JonnElledge	709359774719041536	2016-03-14T12:45:24	rrwholloway Which sounds to me a lot like giving that unaccountable elite more power than they have at the moment!
JonnElledge	709359684814155776	2016-03-14T12:45:02	rrwholloway It is - providing you're willing to accept EU law, pay into the EU budget and allow free movement of people
JonnElledge	709359269963964418	2016-03-14T12:43:23	rrwholloway So you wouldn't want to trade with the EU any more?
JonnElledge	709357890138583041	2016-03-14T12:37:54	rrwholloway Pretending Britain has the same level of control over its destiny as the US does is silly. We don't.
JonnElledge	709357745506377728	2016-03-14T12:37:20	rrwholloway It's just realpolitik, though. It's the same reason Britain can throw its weight around in the EU far more than e.g. Slovenia
JonnElledge	709356398770069504	2016-03-14T12:31:59	rrwholloway "Brexit will be fine because the US coped in 1776"? Is that your argument?
JonnElledge	709354141898960896	2016-03-14T12:23:01	rrwholloway 1776 is a little bit before globalisation kicked in.

JonnElledge	709353180178587648	2016-03-14T12:19:11	rrwholloway Because they're big enough to set the terms in trade deals and we're not...?

JonnElledge	707982395622952963	2016-03-10T17:32:11	MissEllieMae Definitely. But that's one of the reasons why I think we should challenge the idea that it's a world apart.
JonnElledge	707982064415539201	2016-03-10T17:30:52	MissEllieMae I agree - but that's because of the way we, as a society, discuss &amp; perceive it as such.
JonnElledge	707981883104174080	2016-03-10T17:30:09	MissEllieMae Basically I think it's become self-perpetuating:acting as if Oxbridge grads are an elite apart makes it so. And it's bollocks.

JonnElledge	707981570783711234	2016-03-10T17:28:54	MissEllieMae And it re-inforces the "otherness" of Oxbridge, which makes it harder to get them to diversify, because fewer people apply
JonnElledge	707981437962682369	2016-03-10T17:28:23	MissEllieMae The idea there's a line sends the signal that e.g. UCL, LSE or York aren't also world leading universities. It talks them down

JonnElledge	707917023699996672	2016-03-10T13:12:25	AndreasLeKirk Hmmm. Not convinced. A think a definition of imperialism that includes a country trynig to rebuild an empire is... unhelpful.

JonnElledge	707916147446960128	2016-03-10T13:08:56	AndreasLeKirk No, not even slightly. Just pointing out that people never use it to mean e.g. Putin's imperialism.
JonnElledge	707915616099954688	2016-03-10T13:06:49	AndreasLeKirk ...it on Twitter almost always seem to mean something else.
JonnElledge	707915547271364609	2016-03-10T13:06:33	AndreasLeKirk I don't think it is a fiction - that's what I mean about having expressed myself badly. I just meant that people who use...
JonnElledge	707915334410485761	2016-03-10T13:05:42	johnnypaige AndreasLeKirk I think it's become sort of tarnished precisely because so many people mean it to use "I hate Jews"
JonnElledge	707915235051638785	2016-03-10T13:05:19	johnnypaige AndreasLeKirk I mean yeah, in theory, but I honestly can't remember the last time it wasn't used in that sense
