a16z	707647625160359936	2016-03-09T19:21:55	16/ So is this AlphaGo win the beginning of real progress towards generalized intelligence compared to the false start of winning chess?
a16z	707646811024924672	2016-03-09T19:18:41	15/ Rather than just solve problems with  brute force computational power and reliable, large memories
a16z	707646458019708928	2016-03-09T19:17:17	14/ So the oh-so-tantalizing prospect is that we can program computers to mimic human intuition and flow and imagination
a16z	707646260182790145	2016-03-09T19:16:30	13/ Finally, as Google writes: 
a16z	707627097913569280	2016-03-09T18:00:21	12/ figured out how to play and beat Super Mario World

a16z	707626750281297921	2016-03-09T17:58:58	10/ Third, it perfectly illustrates the pendulum switch in AI away from expert systems (capturing human expertise in algorithms) to
a16z	707626591900176384	2016-03-09T17:58:21	9/ very large search space without brute force exploring every node
a16z	707626449625161729	2016-03-09T17:57:47	8/ technique in isolation. Monte Carlo tree search is unsung hero (since deep learning gets all the glory), as it’s great way of exploring
a16z	707626276069122048	2016-03-09T17:57:05	7/ Second, it shows off how an ensemble of learning techniques (deep learning + reinforcement + Monte Carlo tree search) beats any single
a16z	707626077267431424	2016-03-09T17:56:18	6/ compared with chess. Because yo can’t bruce force search space, whole new set of learning algorithms were needed
a16z	707625921138655236	2016-03-09T17:55:41	5/ First, Go is much more complicated than tic-tac-toe or checkers or chess. GOOG points out Go has a googol more possible positions

a16z	707625572071944196	2016-03-09T17:54:18	3/ But here are some reasons AI researchers are fired up about AlphaGo beating Lee Se-dol and how it might presage much more general
a16z	707625273764655104	2016-03-09T17:53:06	2/ We saw similar media mania around Deep Blue beating Kasparov in 1996-97, but that didn't lead to general AI breakthroughs
a16z	707625167288029184	2016-03-09T17:52:41	1/ Why are people so fired up about a computer winning yet-another-board-game?
