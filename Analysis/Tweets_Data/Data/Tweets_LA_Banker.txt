LA_Banker	684608481215660032	2016-01-06T05:32:35	YeaYouRite Think you underestimate even straight-laced bankers‚Äô ability/ingenuity to (legally) sidestep legislation in pursuit of earnings
LA_Banker	684606271182385152	2016-01-06T05:23:49	YeaYouRite would‚Äôve still been legal. GS just separated investment banks from asset-lending banks. Hard to legislate away stupidity.

LA_Banker	684603988411461632	2016-01-06T05:14:44	YeaYouRite Point being: non-GS (integrated) banks survived bc they had deposits. Pure/GS investment banks (LEH/BS) failed bc too much risk
LA_Banker	684600374146170880	2016-01-06T05:00:23	YeaYouRite GS separated inv banks (risky biz) from tradtl lending banks (safe biz). It was GS (risky) banks that failed: Lehman/BearStearns
LA_Banker	684599008946307074	2016-01-06T04:54:57	YeaYouRite Glass-Steagall is fine/good but connecting that to the housing crisis is just... no.
LA_Banker	684597947028213760	2016-01-06T04:50:44	RPA_CRE Best was this bar attached to a Super 8 in Hwood called Whitehorse Inn. They'd microwave hot dogs and you'd meet literal mobsters.
LA_Banker	684597166086569984	2016-01-06T04:47:38	It's almost like there's some axiom clarifying correlation and causation.

LA_Banker	684593745782652928	2016-01-06T04:34:02	RPA_CRE was just wondering if this great bar you found was in LA but sounds like you're out of town

LA_Banker	684285743317950464	2016-01-05T08:10:09	Postmates feels so indulgent. Wish I could (I mean, I prob can) PM myself steamed spinach + grilled chicken breast and I'd scarf it up ASAP.

LA_Banker	683734656320012288	2016-01-03T19:40:19	_TechBanker Ramifications to ego way more risky/tangible than any income variance from under-delivering real life work
LA_Banker	683733232672636928	2016-01-03T19:34:40	_TechBanker yeah I would actually prioritize relearning pre-calc alongside income producing work. Pride is on the line.
LA_Banker	683732874797780992	2016-01-03T19:33:15	_TechBanker the best thing is it's non-office. So opportunity for some fun variance.
LA_Banker	683732708619501574	2016-01-03T19:32:35	Sad thing re:SAT punishment is, if happened to me, I'd prep hell out of SAT math &amp; consider &gt;1500 better victory than Fantasy Fball standing

LA_Banker	683730543033237504	2016-01-03T19:23:59	Currently in argument w/fellow Fantasy FB members whether last place should a) do open-mic comedy routine or b) retake and post SAT results.
