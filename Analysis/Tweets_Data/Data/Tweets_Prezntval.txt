Prezntval	726174853087301633	2016-04-29T22:22:31	Very good from Neil_Irwin - three theories why productivity growth is slowing (or seems to be)   
Prezntval	726172866190811136	2016-04-29T22:14:37	Apropos.  
Prezntval	726169206035636225	2016-04-29T22:00:04	LAEQTY ...as a "safe-haven." That is just plain evil for people who know better. At least Peter Schiff forced to hold back a little bit. ha
Prezntval	726168590299189248	2016-04-29T21:57:38	LAEQTY Right, any responsible fiduciary acknowledges doubt &amp; proper allocation based on risk appetite. Elderly dumping tsy's/cash 4 gold??
Prezntval	726162836787875840	2016-04-29T21:34:46	LAEQTY Yes. It's ez 2 forget &amp; I fully appreciate ppl genuinely believed hyperinflation story. Many who blogged about it were decent folks.
Prezntval	726161324313444352	2016-04-29T21:28:45	LAEQTY No problem. I get fired up about it so I don't want to exaggerate. Hvr, ReformedBroker understating the damage is a bit unsettling.
Prezntval	726158440758804481	2016-04-29T21:17:18	LAEQTY And not to ramble but many doomers went even further than terrible trades. People were really terrified and ZH took advantage.
Prezntval	726157310305820672	2016-04-29T21:12:48	LAEQTY There were many I couldn't help who believed hyperinflation nonsense, citing ZH as a main source of inspiration 4 eventual losses.
Prezntval	726156892045602816	2016-04-29T21:11:09	LAEQTY And as far as my firsthand experience, I personally saved numerous close friends from 95% allocation twd hyperinflation protection.
Prezntval	726156209741418496	2016-04-29T21:08:26	LAEQTY As BBG article exposed, ZH had no accountability 4 unapologetic fear-mongering directly implying trades while motivated by "clicks"
Prezntval	726155745922715648	2016-04-29T21:06:35	LAEQTY Sure, fact is it's just a blog. So, can't be compared to actual criminals. If they were "executing trades," they would be in prison.
Prezntval	726149886454820864	2016-04-29T20:43:18	WDYM Bloomberg markets fed point was good too. Other analysts explanations 4 mkt moves in reaction to CB dynamics seem a bit off at moment.
Prezntval	726142731597156352	2016-04-29T20:14:52	TheStalwart WDYM Great pt about reaction 2 BoJ being indicative of expectations re international CB flexibility. Much seems fed related.

Prezntval	726107202864304128	2016-04-29T17:53:42	Analysts have been wrong on this for years. I don't have a great answer either. It seems some data unreliable + just a complicated formula.
Prezntval	726106706875305984	2016-04-29T17:51:43	Just as when expectations are 2high &amp; good data not good enough. Plus, beside confidence and expectations, tricky which data rep's cause/fx.
Prezntval	726105956145229824	2016-04-29T17:48:44	Tricky when confidence is lower and therefore expectations lower but then expectations are surpassed. That situation often misinterpreted.
Prezntval	726105206526599168	2016-04-29T17:45:46	BathosMan I'm less harsh on Yellen just bc I believe there was semi-reasonable econ reasons 4 FF path (know u disagree) but not now as much
Prezntval	726104531788914688	2016-04-29T17:43:05	BathosMan Yeah, it's very different during Clinton surplus when RGDP was 4.5%! 
Prezntval	726103222339796992	2016-04-29T17:37:53	BathosMan It could be really ugly.
Prezntval	726103065237954560	2016-04-29T17:37:15	BathosMan even the fed's balls may be temporarily inflated. I imagine they'll capitulate a bit but eventually...this won't go on forever.
Prezntval	726102770785259520	2016-04-29T17:36:05	BathosMan It seemed to me that dropping "global" from recent FOMC was practically a threat to govt &amp; RoW rather than worry about US econ.
Prezntval	726102149449416704	2016-04-29T17:33:37	It seems like we're getting closer to really understanding disconnect between data and public attitude toward econ. 
Prezntval	726101028848816128	2016-04-29T17:29:10	BathosMan Yeah, at some pt, govt has 2 accept fed will hike. If govt wants to maintain certain peaceful rel's, trade/fiscal pol chg req'd.

Prezntval	725823635806539776	2016-04-28T23:06:54	kocherlakota009 georgepearkes BV POTUS Right, so that people's expectations aren't being realized and GDP is just denominator.

Prezntval	698950128346882048	2016-02-14T19:21:11	mbusigin Sorry. that's "RPCE" not gdp
Prezntval	698949693905043456	2016-02-14T19:19:27	mbusigin Just to confirm, what do u believe is causing downward pressure that oil crash is rescuing RGDP gwth from?

Prezntval	698903934249750528	2016-02-14T16:17:37	Sad day. Lol. 
Prezntval	698902438468669442	2016-02-14T16:11:40	mbusigin Yes, I understand that. If ur going to start calling what happened there a consumer spending boon, well...U did say b4 it wasn't?
Prezntval	698901327942823938	2016-02-14T16:07:16	mbusigin Yeah, it faded quickly after crash, bounced around, never regained prev trend and has edged lower...with oil price dropping.
Prezntval	698899826012868609	2016-02-14T16:01:18	mbusigin ur own chart cites trend begs at start of 2014 before oil crash even happened.
Prezntval	698898423005605893	2016-02-14T15:55:43	mbusigin Sure, it bounced around but was considerably flattened as illustrated by GDP which slowed considerably EXACT same time.
Prezntval	698897493736599553	2016-02-14T15:52:02	mbusigin You said yourself that RGDP would be higher without oil crash. I changed mind?

Prezntval	694022139867852801	2016-02-01T04:59:07	QuarrelAU Idea is just that ur looking for max payoff considering volatility AND w the most positive skew possible. Separating vol &amp; skew.
Prezntval	694021055531208704	2016-02-01T04:54:48	QuarrelAU An easy way to think of it is the same nntaleb math can be applied to other side (pos skew) as well. Oversimplification buuut...
Prezntval	694020259766861826	2016-02-01T04:51:38	QuarrelAU Both ways, you're assuming the historical returns are not perfectly predictive. It's just how ur analyzing those tails.
Prezntval	694019941171769344	2016-02-01T04:50:22	QuarrelAU U fatten tails 4 pos the same way you would for negative skew or Black Swans. It's a mistake 2 only apply tech to dark side. Lol
Prezntval	694017566700797952	2016-02-01T04:40:56	QuarrelAU For ex. Positive skew strategy is worth paying premium.
Prezntval	694016999278538752	2016-02-01T04:38:41	QuarrelAU Yeah but it's still important 2b consistent mathematically. Ur looking for consistency from strategy 2 apply historical data.
Prezntval	694014046643687425	2016-02-01T04:26:57	Funny how often ppl bring up black swans &amp; neg skew but don't talk about opposite pos side. Ooh, does your model acct 4 unexpected boon? Lol

Prezntval	693841416938622976	2016-01-31T17:00:59	mbusigin He really has missed improvements. I don't mind that he missed hike date but just that he's so adamant it was wrong move.
Prezntval	693839806992818176	2016-01-31T16:54:35	mbusigin Sure, I just personally enjoy his econ posts more. A bit ironic that ZLB expert so rabid about hike (I'm aware of nuance there).
Prezntval	693836309597548544	2016-01-31T16:40:41	mbusigin Given his recent posts, he's not even an economist anymore. He's become a Trump/Cruz expert.

Prezntval	692921091887644676	2016-01-29T04:03:56	This too. RGDP growth immediately slowed after 2014 was looking like US about to go full breakout by every metric. 
Prezntval	692919929536905222	2016-01-29T03:59:19	mbusigin Also, going forward, think it will be likely be positive but won't overcome "hysteresis" and prob less pos than u guyz believe.
Prezntval	692919178152538112	2016-01-29T03:56:20	Prezntval mbusigin I'll argue it's been neg rather than nil. There are a few other disagreements too. So, some more fun discussions 2 come

Prezntval	692916240516562945	2016-01-29T03:44:40	mbusigin Just to show you were referring to RGDP: 
Prezntval	692915501631148032	2016-01-29T03:41:43	mbusigin Not giving me this uncivilized: You said it even stronger than this but this is undeniable: 
Prezntval	692914653043822592	2016-01-29T03:38:21	mbusigin U recently presented counterfactual suggesting that RGDP was affected which is great. But good ex of me saying nil instead of neg.
Prezntval	692914053149237250	2016-01-29T03:35:58	mbusigin Sheesh, here's YOU and I debating it in Feb, Lol: 
Prezntval	692912560883003392	2016-01-29T03:30:02	mbusigin Urgh....Well I was responding to consensus in media mostly: Here's first article from google search: 
Prezntval	692910901704261632	2016-01-29T03:23:27	mbusigin You really need me to cite statements that oil crash would be great positive and "tax-cut?"
Prezntval	692910649316233216	2016-01-29T03:22:27	mbusigin Really? HAH! I'd look better w nothing to cite. We had this exact debate b4. Ppl were actually saying ex-energy consumption boom.
Prezntval	692909447857876992	2016-01-29T03:17:40	mbusigin And going forward from here, I'm actually annoyed by how crazy negative everybody is and expect it will prob be +ve.Cautiously pos
Prezntval	692909180382908416	2016-01-29T03:16:36	mbusigin Evidence is definitely very light. My original pt was just that it wouldn't be an immediate panacea like ppl suggesting. ---&gt;

Prezntval	692669039936573440	2016-01-28T11:22:22	BathosMan Right, ppl claiming IRS curve better price structure and liquidity than tsy when floating payments a factor and regs brand new.

Prezntval	692666547706277888	2016-01-28T11:12:28	BathosMan Not just TED obviously but this relationship always seemed weirdly useful to me: 
Prezntval	692665859047710720	2016-01-28T11:09:44	BathosMan Curious what u think about neg spreads and gen environment ie new regs, funding especially. I've been obsessed w funding stuffs.

Prezntval	692622781184249856	2016-01-28T08:18:34	naufalsanaullah Your concerned about US consumption effect? Where are ya on wages and core pce at this point?

Prezntval	692621547928887297	2016-01-28T08:13:39	naufalsanaullah Exactly and I'm surprised u believe hike would be mistake. I totally see ur pt &amp; the risks involved. Mostly mkt issue tho?

Prezntval	692619645300289536	2016-01-28T08:06:06	naufalsanaullah Yeah and it doesn't have to be such a crazy idea if fed were a little tougher and consistent + stayed course with hikes.IDK
Prezntval	692618973255323648	2016-01-28T08:03:26	naufalsanaullah And I'm drifting into politically impossible territory but something in that direction via firm stance and talk from fed.
Prezntval	692618735203414016	2016-01-28T08:02:29	naufalsanaullah If fiscal pol were to counteract each hike w appropriate spending...pretty freakin aggressive. 4 hikes,1 being 50bps prob:)
Prezntval	692617778252021760	2016-01-28T07:58:41	naufalsanaullah Ideally, fed raises aggressively while fiscal policy takes small steps with much better results = ideal policy mix.
Prezntval	692617351368282112	2016-01-28T07:56:59	naufalsanaullah Econ will stay fine even with these meaningless tiny hikes. Fiscal coefficient massive by comparison.
Prezntval	692617141216899072	2016-01-28T07:56:09	naufalsanaullah Bc risks of ZIRP are unknown at best &amp; doing little to help at this point. They've already done heavy lifting and econ fine
Prezntval	692616754007150592	2016-01-28T07:54:37	naufalsanaullah Fed wouldn't be saying we couldn't continue gradual unsatisfying pace of improvement but that small hikes won't chg that.
Prezntval	692616376150728704	2016-01-28T07:53:06	naufalsanaullah Hear me out: They're already suggesting it pretty overtly. Could say we're in decent shape but any dramatic +ve = fiscal
Prezntval	692615537038200832	2016-01-28T07:49:46	naufalsanaullah My dream would be rate hike with statement that Taylor coefficient so weak that fiscal policy now only true game in town:)
Prezntval	692486079723782144	2016-01-27T23:15:21	In last decade IRS supply-demand imbalances lead 2 fee increases that were partly responsible 4 neg spreads. Ppl already want as benchmark??

Prezntval	692480937318322178	2016-01-27T22:54:55	JMT48656055 mccormickliz tracyalloway Liquid but still payments from floating% which is reason neg spread surprises anyone. LIBOR for ex
Prezntval	692476089575346182	2016-01-27T22:35:39	JMT48656055 mccormickliz tracyalloway Just isn't nec. IRS liquidity already assists &amp; tsy isn't more problematic despite neg swap spread.
Prezntval	692474868433076225	2016-01-27T22:30:48	JMT48656055 mccormickliz tracyalloway IRS essentially risk free but that isn't only requirement as preferable benchmark.

Prezntval	692467366790352897	2016-01-27T22:01:00	Geez, with all the attention interest rate swaps are getting these days, they might as well be benchmark. Lol!!
Prezntval	692464977530191872	2016-01-27T21:51:30	tracyalloway mccormickliz No problem. I'm being more intense about it than is warranted. Lol. IRS assisting in quasi-benchmark role anyway

Prezntval	692456611206582273	2016-01-27T21:18:15	This talk about replacing benchmark has been going on forever and isn't that interesting. IRS can assist tsy benchmark without any big chg.
Prezntval	692454226916564992	2016-01-27T21:08:47	M_C_Klein Lack of fungibility and counterparty risk are big problem and NY Fed agrees: 
Prezntval	692451907152056321	2016-01-27T20:59:34	M_C_Klein Lol. Wait, rate differential is exactly the problem. The pref for fixed vs floating is essence of rate swap and can chg wildly
Prezntval	692450447601356802	2016-01-27T20:53:46	Wow. So, it doesn't matter at all what a swap actually is? "Risk-free" isn't only req for benchmark. Sheesh!

Prezntval	691743928328937473	2016-01-25T22:06:19	Interesting is: low LFP =/= weak gwth but LFP does relate to hysteresis and the non-recovering aspects of recoveries.

Prezntval	691742308417441792	2016-01-25T21:59:52	I like Bullard's "discussion" of LFP  and REALLY like the concept of: the marginal propensity to work. Sounds funny but...
Prezntval	691740751076544512	2016-01-25T21:53:41	And it's wrong to say demographics "imply" LFP drop is insignificant. It's just that demos explain 99% of drop in LF. The margin is useful.

Prezntval	691682361411407872	2016-01-25T18:01:40	So hard part about calling oil crash timing was it was impossible to know which corrupt, speculative, political strand of web would break.
Prezntval	691681839170191360	2016-01-25T17:59:35	It was beyond obvious that fundamentals had little to do with oil price. Debate was politics vs speculation vs corruption as main driver.

Prezntval	691384423208480769	2016-01-24T22:17:46	diane1859 Just getting into ur work. Great stuff! We're all reconciling dominance of DM svcs as ISM, GDP etc headlines increasingly confuse
Prezntval	691380907626745858	2016-01-24T22:03:48	Factors like globalization of production &amp; the rise of services-based DM econs are making GDP less representative and useful.
Prezntval	691378432593125377	2016-01-24T21:53:58	She makes the point that we're on the cusp of a significant rethinking of theoretical framework for measuring economic activity.
Prezntval	691376610612633600	2016-01-24T21:46:43	Been thinking about the diane1859 point of view that GDP is taken too seriously as it was developed from a manufacturing based perspective.
Prezntval	691312964473790464	2016-01-24T17:33:49	Chris_arnade These are the kinds of insights economists should consider bc it helps explain some of the negativity despite positive data.

Prezntval	690942344338612224	2016-01-23T17:01:06	mbusigin Those periods are also great laboratories 4 comparison/juxtaposition and specifics...which the NBER consistently shows w research.
Prezntval	690941999743000576	2016-01-23T16:59:44	mbusigin Lol. Yeah, it's just unnecessarily confusing 2 use term recession that way. We have a bunch of terms 4 bummer econ sans recession.
Prezntval	690933182938480640	2016-01-23T16:24:42	mbusigin So, we just relax &amp; let everyone rest on their past glory. Just let the good times roll huh? Maybe, take pot? Do alcohol? CHILL!??
Prezntval	690930939560472577	2016-01-23T16:15:47	mbusigin Actually, no. We need a precise definition of recession. Anything less is uncivilized.
Prezntval	690929470937522176	2016-01-23T16:09:57	mbusigin Okay. I haven't actually "seen" NBER do anything like declare the US has been in recession post-GR like ECRI/Mish, so until then:)
Prezntval	690923699826872320	2016-01-23T15:47:01	mbusigin Well, that's interesting but maybe NBER and ECRI....and Mish Shedlock (LOL!!) should just find another term.
Prezntval	690923197768699904	2016-01-23T15:45:01	mbusigin Their papers are priceless to me. Was gonna read 1990 Yellen NBER paper today. But why use term "recession?" ECRI certainly screws
Prezntval	690922359121784832	2016-01-23T15:41:41	mbusigin Well geez. Amen. Exactly.
Prezntval	690921845910949889	2016-01-23T15:39:39	mbusigin Whew!!!! hahaha
Prezntval	690921011504492544	2016-01-23T15:36:20	mbusigin Interesting though, do you know of a country where this going on for prolonged period?
Prezntval	690920750019051520	2016-01-23T15:35:18	mbusigin Lol. So, there are just a bunch of these 1 qtr recessions happening and that seems like a useful definition to you?
Prezntval	690919049388101632	2016-01-23T15:28:32	mbusigin There are basically zero examples of that situation in recent (max chart) US history (for more than qtr). Other countries though?
Prezntval	690917853248118784	2016-01-23T15:23:47	mbusigin I mean, can you name a real example right now?
Prezntval	690917641007968256	2016-01-23T15:22:56	mbusigin Yes, I get that but plz tell me you aren't saying that a country with positive GDP is currently in recession. Lol
Prezntval	690916576367812609	2016-01-23T15:18:43	mbusigin You're scaring me.
Prezntval	690915466403938305	2016-01-23T15:14:18	mbusigin Of course. Remember when ECRI bozo, Lakshman Achuthan, said he used it. We all made fun of def. Fun times.

Prezntval	690566113457864704	2016-01-22T16:06:06	Putting in the effort 2 find good analysis is VERY different than doing the good analysis yourself. So, calm down about "being in the know."

Prezntval	690557893729394689	2016-01-22T15:33:26	Remember, at the onset of oil crash, consensus was it would be an immediate stimulus, a tax-cut. After that did NOT happen, view changed.

Prezntval	690345549682327553	2016-01-22T01:29:39	calculatedrisk Makes sense bc many got interested in econ during crisis so they joined fintwit right at beginning of long recovery. Haha!
Prezntval	690338889794334720	2016-01-22T01:03:11	However, they did also state that "typically, the difference between the inflation swap rate and the breakeven rate remained fairly stable."
Prezntval	690337916682285056	2016-01-22T00:59:19	Inflation swaps =/= TIPS breakeven when elevation in the bid/ask spread suggested illiquidity. Hard 2 deny evidence.

Prezntval	690237633209860096	2016-01-21T18:20:50	BathosMan lrzhou Capex is just one ez way to illustrate it anyway. Competitors use invest however they want obviously.
Prezntval	690237292221366272	2016-01-21T18:19:29	BathosMan lrzhou If destroying entire regions of competitors no longer discourages investment, this is a very brave new world. Lol
Prezntval	690236835612663808	2016-01-21T18:17:40	BathosMan lrzhou As much as 1 can discern "concern," industry believes Saudis know tech inevitable but risk/reward = maintain production.
Prezntval	690235756825018368	2016-01-21T18:13:23	BathosMan lrzhou Just common sense that even if Iran was main concern, certainly not ONLY concern. 10 birds w 1 stone kind of thing.
Prezntval	690235241353457664	2016-01-21T18:11:20	BathosMan lrzhou You really think Saudis only care about Iran? The point is by scaring investors, capex for competitors forever damaged.
Prezntval	690234485065973760	2016-01-21T18:08:19	BathosMan lrzhou Not that there's anything wrong with that. lol

Prezntval	689816414153080834	2016-01-20T14:27:03	(5/n) I've been bullish on US wages, infl &amp; employ for 2016 + supported hike. Hvr, I could be wrong about econ but still right on mon policy
Prezntval	689815554970951680	2016-01-20T14:23:39	Prezntval (4/n) Or, it could be that targeting lowering natural rate (or below) and overshooting inflation target is exactly what is needed
Prezntval	689814910524522496	2016-01-20T14:21:05	Prezntval (3/n) Debate is whether focus on natural rate &amp; R* can provide solutions for those issues. It could be that in US, fed incapable
Prezntval	689814146053865472	2016-01-20T14:18:03	Prezntval (2/n) Mon policy has lost credibility and people see LTUE/job mismatch and slow wage gwth and deflation as issues.........
Prezntval	689813229283880962	2016-01-20T14:14:24	Prezntval (1/n) Paradox is we can decrease UER with little inflation. However UER isn't public concern. Deflation &amp; other employ issues are
Prezntval	689809797907140608	2016-01-20T14:00:46	Real exports and imports of goods and services show continued slow growth  
Prezntval	689808527406161920	2016-01-20T13:55:43	So that US small θ coefficient (1% decrease UER=0.2 infl short term) not worth mon action ie near full employ +certain metrics say infl here
Prezntval	689805806162718720	2016-01-20T13:44:54	US vs UK mon pol Q is interesting. Really just crunching Phillips curve &amp; political capital. If even possible, huge mon pol req 4 inflation.
Prezntval	689804420440162304	2016-01-20T13:39:24	M_C_Klein georgepearkes GavinHJackson The pt being mon policy in the US is constrained. If UK similar, REALLY pts finger at fiscal policy
Prezntval	689801732608552960	2016-01-20T13:28:43	M_C_Klein georgepearkes GavinHJackson Real issue is small θ coefficient in US implies 1% decrease in UER = 0.2 increase in inflation.
Prezntval	689798741306421248	2016-01-20T13:16:50	LJKawa M_C_Klein hmmm. good pt. All the differences between 2 countries prob confounds but ur "closest we get" point still stands.
Prezntval	689796576567394304	2016-01-20T13:08:14	It could just be whom I choose 2 follow &amp; other personal biases but there seems a gaping hole in fintwit of ppl actually working in politics

Prezntval	689608692501581824	2016-01-20T00:41:39	At onset of oil crash, I said impact on US 2015 will be battle of marginal propensities &amp; that it didn't look spectacular. Was bullish 2016.
Prezntval	689603514557792258	2016-01-20T00:21:04	BrattleStCap Good pts. Of course, whatever happens going fwd won't chg 2015 when all gwth slowed right w oil crash. 
Prezntval	689602179817050112	2016-01-20T00:15:46	Ppl will forever try to rewrite history of great oil crash impact on US econ circa 2015. Luckily, I've saved charts 4 posterity's sake. Lol.

Prezntval	689573973676261376	2016-01-19T22:23:41	If we could just merge pts made today by ojblanchard1 and kocherlakota009 by helping congress 2 understand mon policy can't do everything.

Prezntval	689538830114775041	2016-01-19T20:04:02	Aileron_Trading Yeah, I sharpened focus on TED a lil bit ago bc of rel2 swap spreads (10yr turned neg) but not great by itself. :)
Prezntval	689537435911335936	2016-01-19T19:58:30	Aileron_Trading I hear ya but there's several goings on in funding/repo, not catastrophic but...helped me anyway2C: 
Prezntval	689524978589405184	2016-01-19T19:09:00	A better picture is swap spreads after the CFTC's final SEF rules went into effect August 2013: 
Prezntval	689520071794765825	2016-01-19T18:49:30	And naturally, closely tracks tsy's so easier to see in IRS spread but this shows US/EUR bifurcation after SEP. 
Prezntval	689513200346202112	2016-01-19T18:22:12	--&gt;SEP made dealers less relevant which always invokes tantrums from old guard. The usual from greater access/tech ie pos's &amp; growing pains.
Prezntval	689512280745086976	2016-01-19T18:18:32	--&gt;SEP lowered execution costs, provided more liquidity but also fragmented mkt &amp; created bifurcation betwixt USD &amp; EUR. EU will impose '17.
Prezntval	689509193523400704	2016-01-19T18:06:16	In Feb 2014, Swap Execution Facilities (SEP) were forced upon the IRS (swap) mkt. U can see what followed. liquidity

Prezntval	688457187320926208	2016-01-16T20:25:59	naufalsanaullah Also, bev curve shows skills mismatch=more LTUE=likely to leave LF/reduce slack but obviously, this illusory.
Prezntval	688456857095028736	2016-01-16T20:24:40	naufalsanaullah Just like it's possible to get large NFP with AHE increase...but NFP should start to fall near full employ.
Prezntval	688456636420100096	2016-01-16T20:23:47	naufalsanaullah It's just a factor kinda like NFP where it should fall approaching full employ/NAIRU. I assign a particular weight to it.

Prezntval	688454318081441795	2016-01-16T20:14:34	TheStalwart Important to take contribution weightings into account:  It's supposed to be "financial" stress not mkt.
Prezntval	688441672410116096	2016-01-16T19:24:19	naufalsanaullah There are so many positive employment and wage numbers that I try hard to find the couple hidden neg's that will delay.
Prezntval	688440340328493056	2016-01-16T19:19:02	naufalsanaullah Ppl get very fired up and defensive about LFP &amp; flows. But Yellen examines closely. Nobody wants 2 admit non-demog issues.
Prezntval	688439171082395648	2016-01-16T19:14:23	naufalsanaullah Ppl focused on positives of people rejoining labor force but forget that hiring from outside LF means less wage pressure.
Prezntval	688438808224792576	2016-01-16T19:12:57	naufalsanaullah One thing I've been watching that others juuuust started noticing for wages is shadow UE 
Prezntval	688438257567141888	2016-01-16T19:10:45	naufalsanaullah ...but is more interesting for the point you're making.
Prezntval	688438032383410176	2016-01-16T19:09:52	naufalsanaullah True &amp; even if MPS remains where it is, income should spur warm goodness. MPC is kinda the least interesting of those var's
Prezntval	688433302257053696	2016-01-16T18:51:04	Wow. I'm really winning the war I waged against grammar. Lol. It's getting a bit ridiculous even for tiwtter though. haha

Prezntval	688425862102818817	2016-01-16T18:21:30	naufalsanaullah I think MPC, AHE, inflation etc...all poised to breakout. There are some risks, worst of which is in ppl's heads but...
Prezntval	688425244160204800	2016-01-16T18:19:03	naufalsanaullah Right. Now that econ world exploding w negativity re oil, I'm switching sides, believe damage is done=+ve impulse going fwd

Prezntval	686444333503918080	2016-01-11T07:07:37	My Favorite RIP
Prezntval	686383180035657730	2016-01-11T03:04:37	BathosMan Absolutely. I got it into my head early on that you were west coast too.
Prezntval	686382190708445184	2016-01-11T03:00:41	BathosMan Oh, I know exactly what bothers you about it. Lol. Anyway, have a good night sir. Gf forcing GGlobes and dinner on me. :)
Prezntval	686380679270019073	2016-01-11T02:54:40	BathosMan Not tonight but someday I'll get ya to chill out a bit on this one. Lol.
Prezntval	686380150800306176	2016-01-11T02:52:34	BathosMan He has enough mojo to call it a "Galactic Economy!" Hahaha!
Prezntval	686379786860560384	2016-01-11T02:51:08	BathosMan I know what you're saying. My pt is that people use the term in a way that isn't so bad. Sometimes used in a very dumb way tho
Prezntval	686379198886236160	2016-01-11T02:48:47	BathosMan ahhh, still uses the term though.
Prezntval	686377137276727296	2016-01-11T02:40:36	BathosMan I know u like Pettis. Here's Pettis calling it a "Global Economy." 
Prezntval	686376139095318529	2016-01-11T02:36:38	BathosMan See, that's a little extreme. The fed calls it a "global economy."
Prezntval	686375953509920768	2016-01-11T02:35:54	BathosMan It's not a particularly illuminating term. I mean, you could call a lemonade stand with one customer an economy.
Prezntval	686374412606570496	2016-01-11T02:29:46	BathosMan Well then we agree on mechanics and as far as semantics, most ppl use term "economy" pretty loosely. I don't but I don't mind it.
Prezntval	686373928328007681	2016-01-11T02:27:51	BathosMan Granger causal. JK. No, kinda the point is that it's "like" fed running global mon policy...in effect...even tho it's not.
Prezntval	686372635643527168	2016-01-11T02:22:43	BathosMan &amp; it's not that ECB doesn't make decisions, it's just US policy has such big impact on what mon pol shld be doing 4 other nations
Prezntval	686371892488310784	2016-01-11T02:19:45	BathosMan Charts like this are pretty telling and there are many of them: 
Prezntval	686371420130029568	2016-01-11T02:17:53	BathosMan Semantics of what constitutes an "economy" aside, in all seriousness, paper makes decent case 4 US dictating global mon policy
Prezntval	686369114756022272	2016-01-11T02:08:43	BathosMan hehe. You said you'll accept "International Economy" so I can live with that. :) 
Prezntval	686365500918501376	2016-01-11T01:54:22	NotJKRowling Chris_arnade Well that's nitpicking isn't it?
Prezntval	686362504042119168	2016-01-11T01:42:27	Of course, 4 more detail, u'll have 2 search through all that jazz &amp; there's plenty of it. I tweeted ~ 3 blogs worth of swap spread jazz.
Prezntval	686361678842204160	2016-01-11T01:39:10	Now that ppl talkin about fun things like TED, here's my Nov forecast of TED jump 2 wks b4 big move based on swaps:) 
Prezntval	686351517901701120	2016-01-11T00:58:48	Sorta trolling but I wouldn't even mind a US energy sector bailout + partially nationalizing  US oil while Saudis battle Iran, Russia etc...
Prezntval	686349389841870849	2016-01-11T00:50:20	US fully capable of monster gwth despite RoW. Q is what exactly have we done 2 compensate/benefit besides sittin around in USD beast mode??
Prezntval	686347600539209729	2016-01-11T00:43:14	It doesn't matter how crazy massive and closed US economy is. We are flexible as heckfire too. If we don't compensate 4 RoW, gwth disrupted.
Prezntval	686344347919319040	2016-01-11T00:30:18	BathosMan Lol this is definitely "global aggregated analysis" per ur definition:  I think whole paper would annoy ya
Prezntval	686342603420209152	2016-01-11T00:23:22	BathosMan Haha. So, this paper isn't describing a global economy?
Prezntval	686330425015320576	2016-01-10T23:34:59	naufalsanaullah Haha. What a bozo. Hey, have u heard this song?  nicolatheron posted earlier. can't stop. lol
Prezntval	686310943907643392	2016-01-10T22:17:34	BenEisen DavidSchawel Also quick note re TED relationship to swap spreads:  which supports transitory thesis.
Prezntval	686308160479428610	2016-01-10T22:06:31	(2/2)&lt;---&gt; (why) LIBOR is most telling as when used to assess what banks are trying NOT to say ie LOIS/CDS or LIBOR/mkt expectations.
Prezntval	686307716629856256	2016-01-10T22:04:45	(1/2) Now I'm in the strange position of defending LIBOR being that I fully appreciate this:  which is WHY----&gt;
Prezntval	686304420426940416	2016-01-10T21:51:39	Okay! Hadn't heard this. Very cool good fun. :) 
Prezntval	686303711010791424	2016-01-10T21:48:50	I'm very excited about issues Fintwit is getting into right now because I know some incredible discourse/coverage is imminent. Yes! lol
Prezntval	686300139082756096	2016-01-10T21:34:38	BenEisen TheStalwart DavidSchawel Yeah, sev issues: structural chg, end of yr balancing etc. Exp say transitory. 
Prezntval	686296303207239680	2016-01-10T21:19:24	TheStalwart DavidSchawel BenEisen This &amp; LIBOR (TED, LOIS) both useful &amp; say different things. Ignoring what banks say w LIBOR is silly.
Prezntval	686292664279384064	2016-01-10T21:04:56	SoberLook PortlandCTA TheStalwart That's true but it's useful to consider what banks are saying with LIBOR even if distorted.
Prezntval	686291671131131904	2016-01-10T21:00:59	More Rey: Not only does she kick Neo-Fisherism's teeth in but attempts 2 extend globally. I'm still considering but 
Prezntval	686289562516062210	2016-01-10T20:52:37	More from that Helene Rey thing: Interesting take on US monetary policy effects. 
Prezntval	686278101534298112	2016-01-10T20:07:04	enlundm platosbunker TheStalwart Good points. Great topic. Prescient. :)
Prezntval	686272355887271941	2016-01-10T19:44:14	Wow. This is definitely a bold paper from Helene Rey &amp; co and I think it might put BathosMan in a straitjacket:)

Prezntval	686249944366223361	2016-01-10T18:15:11	TheStalwart So that something like this  illustrates short-term stress/balancing as opposed to anything scary.
Prezntval	686249210971197440	2016-01-10T18:12:16	TheStalwart When u guyz were talkin neg swaps, TED 1st place 2 look:  But LOIS vs 3mo-ON LIBOR ~end of yr balancing.
Prezntval	686247259940339712	2016-01-10T18:04:31	That's for sure. I basically wrote an entire sci-fi novel about Aramco IPO last night.  
Prezntval	686218242159996928	2016-01-10T16:09:12	Question #3 for 2016: What will the unemployment rate be in December 2016? 
Prezntval	686240102201163776	2016-01-10T17:36:04	Yeah, as several dozen of my ultra-lucky followers know alllll about. Haha! 
Prezntval	686145792583716865	2016-01-10T11:21:19	Just up late thinking about all the stuff Aramco could do with that cash. Imagine the consolidation possibilities. Likely to branch out tho.
Prezntval	686142492719190016	2016-01-10T11:08:12	Remember, Aramco announced in November that it would tap bond markets. Interesting 2 consider *public* Aramco impact on energy sector bonds.
Prezntval	686093311589748736	2016-01-10T07:52:47	hahaha!  
Prezntval	686062109122113537	2016-01-10T05:48:47	Many thought PIMCO was being dramatic about structural issues in repo, funding mkts etc...but I have 2 say it made prrty good sense 2 me.
Prezntval	686059266797469696	2016-01-10T05:37:30	I noticed it recently with swap spreads as pref's for fixed vs floating rates and regulatory/structural issues for dealers underestimated.
Prezntval	686057898485518336	2016-01-10T05:32:03	Easy to assume that corps will do x,y,z when flush w/ cash. I C it a lot &amp; even if ppl are right, the implications can be counter-intuitive.
Prezntval	686055782815629312	2016-01-10T05:23:39	Yes. Don't let corp cash hoard distort ur analysis of mkts ie corp's search for best rates for funding/financing and what it means for econ.

Prezntval	684477741933068288	2016-01-05T20:53:05	Damage to investment is done. In US, we might as well enjoy the lower price which now outweighs new negatives.
