darioperkins	726146740227833860	2016-04-29T20:30:48	fwred petrolo1 ECB QE reduced euro, which supported core input prices. Support now fading
darioperkins	726146494047375362	2016-04-29T20:29:49	fwred petrolo1 but then we have very high immigration in Germany and signs that wages are slowing rather than accelerating
darioperkins	726146320092766208	2016-04-29T20:29:08	fwred petrolo1 best shot is labour mkt mismatch,where tight German labour mkt causes higher wages &amp; rigidities prevent periphery deflation
darioperkins	726145990999330817	2016-04-29T20:27:50	fwred petrolo1 I actually agree with your optimistic view on euro area. I just struggle to see where inflation comes from
darioperkins	726144788010033152	2016-04-29T20:23:03	fwred petrolo1 well inflation shouldn't rise, unless you believe in 'speed limits'
darioperkins	726144415018967040	2016-04-29T20:21:34	fwred petrolo1 no idea but Draghi said in speech it's negative over entire forecast

darioperkins	726135776447217665	2016-04-29T19:47:14	petrolo1 fwred this kind of misses the point though - question is why inflation should return to 2% with (-)output gap

darioperkins	725593038374981632	2016-04-28T07:50:35	fwred huge boost from oil! I'm exaggerating but point stands - the 'deflation' so far has been helpful
darioperkins	725589517315506176	2016-04-28T07:36:36	'He's a good economist' was always a diss for central bank govnors. Just like 'interesting idea for academics' was Draghi diss for üöÅmoney
darioperkins	725588433582837761	2016-04-28T07:32:18	fwred deflation is the only way the euro area has managed to grow..
darioperkins	725588119131709440	2016-04-28T07:31:03	Gilesyb that's why I said 'reasonably'. Talking about what is reasonable policy for major central bank. There are limits (outside academia)

darioperkins	725236392289296385	2016-04-27T08:13:24	t0nyyates andrew_lilico the worst evidence is from exit camp, all this nonsense about EU regulatory costs (Congdon etc)
darioperkins	725236094959230976	2016-04-27T08:12:13	t0nyyates andrew_lilico because they overstate trade benefits within EU. 'Sign' is correct, not sure about magnitude
