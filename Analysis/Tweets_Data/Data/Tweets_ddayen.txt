ddayen	709793445263446016	2016-03-15T17:28:39	jesseltaylor Atrios Yes, basically default is not an option. You might think you've defaulted but eventually you'll pay

ddayen	709793054920560640	2016-03-15T17:27:06	thesarahrose Atrios The good reason to not default is 1) you probably qualify for income-based repayment that would lower payments a lot

ddayen	707788786827010048	2016-03-10T04:42:51	The real problem is TARP's structure made Congressional accountability impossible, outside of a BS vote &amp; an underfunded oversight panel

ddayen	694949371142545409	2016-02-03T18:23:36	ObsoleteDogma instead of getting huffy about it, maybe put that in the body of the piece. It's an interesting data point.

ddayen	688049920054431744	2016-01-15T17:27:38	2. It's a $5bn settlement. Of that, $1.8bn is for "refinancing and loan modifications," which makes good fiscal sense for investors

ddayen	684460088891867136	2016-01-05T19:42:56	jeffspross rortybomb because it's a response in a political campaign rather than a nuanced discussion?
