AdrianChen	719680368006316032	2016-04-12T00:15:45	adrianchen my contribution to the podcast vs radio debate.
AdrianChen	719677723594137600	2016-04-12T00:05:14	I remember these :( 
AdrianChen	719632790745178112	2016-04-11T21:06:42	BigMeanInternet ...but I also think the idea that for him to have acted less shady he had to go to the cops is fucked up.
AdrianChen	719632634050146305	2016-04-11T21:06:04	BigMeanInternet ultimately i don't like the idea of journalists as operating according to some special moral standard...
AdrianChen	719631875376070656	2016-04-11T21:03:03	BigMeanInternet Yeah I think he crossed from observer to participant when he signed an agreement that precluded him writing about it.
AdrianChen	719630762081972227	2016-04-11T20:58:38	BigMeanInternet JHatesSports what do u mean, that talese shouldn't have reported it without more evidence?
AdrianChen	719630249693155328	2016-04-11T20:56:36	BigMeanInternet JHatesSports or at least not in the way that Foos recounted it.

AdrianChen	719629550876016640	2016-04-11T20:53:49	JHatesSports yeah, it was wild
AdrianChen	719629370063720449	2016-04-11T20:53:06	CalebMelby huge! You're not giving the cops anything that you are not giving your readers, and the subject, too.
AdrianChen	719628274251526144	2016-04-11T20:48:45	...but I definitely don't think he should have gone to the cops!
AdrianChen	719628192634511360	2016-04-11T20:48:25	I think a case could maybe be made that Talese should have broken his agreement w/ foos in the name of public safety and written about it...

AdrianChen	716769164174761984	2016-04-03T23:27:40	I think unmasking anonymous people will be one of the biggest tasks of journalism in the future. One reason panamapapers is so exciting.

AdrianChen	716766864429432833	2016-04-03T23:18:32	Some really interesting background on panamapapers from S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, which received the leak:

AdrianChen	716733089632878592	2016-04-03T21:04:19	BarkerTV @AmberALeeFrost u gotta read the old New York profile of him that talks about his "research" for the book. It's wild.
AdrianChen	716731784130654209	2016-04-03T20:59:08	@AmberALeeFrost it's really good. And he went to... Uh, extreme lengths to research it 
AdrianChen	716730477420417024	2016-04-03T20:53:56	AmberALeeFrost ...just super straight
AdrianChen	716730445908549633	2016-04-03T20:53:49	@AmberALeeFrost but seriously did u ever read "Thy Neighbor's Wife?" A book entirely about sex and it didn't strike me as sexist at all...
AdrianChen	716730270716665857	2016-04-03T20:53:07	@AmberALeeFrost oh same on that one too
AdrianChen	716722759297081345	2016-04-03T20:23:16	@AmberALeeFrost same tbh
AdrianChen	716704666390773760	2016-04-03T19:11:22	lol "Sandalwood Continental Ltd." is the most shady offshore banking name ever. 
AdrianChen	716702850366246912	2016-04-03T19:04:09	adrianchen probably should have tagged this panamapapers
AdrianChen	716692629279412224	2016-04-03T18:23:32	So panamapapers is now trending worldwide with more than 25,100 tweets. Great for investigative journalism.
