MichaelSLinden	725138793062371328	2016-04-27T01:45:35	This. I also think we'll get to see how powerful a relatively popular President Obama in full campaign mode can be. 
MichaelSLinden	725136495917543424	2016-04-27T01:36:27	Remember earlier this year, when GOP turnout in primaries was far outpacing Dem's?  Votes in PA with 30% in: Dems - 450,000 GOP - 245,000
MichaelSLinden	725132389463265280	2016-04-27T01:20:08	Pssst. Both primary contests are over.

MichaelSLinden	725115815763279872	2016-04-27T00:14:17	In Connecticut, early exits have it close, with Clinton up by 3 points.

MichaelSLinden	725114112087347200	2016-04-27T00:07:30	According to early exits, in Maryland, Clinton won both white voters by 15 points, and non-white voters by 40.
MichaelSLinden	725113374640607233	2016-04-27T00:04:35	Oh, wow. Early exits have Clinton winning in Maryland by 30 points. No wonder they called it immediately.
MichaelSLinden	725112940672720898	2016-04-27T00:02:51	Early exits have Clinton winning Pennsylvania by 10 points.

MichaelSLinden	722618483981303808	2016-04-20T02:50:46	gabrielkahane My longer take on this subject: 
MichaelSLinden	722617603718586368	2016-04-20T02:47:16	gabrielkahane Sander is neither as left as some suppose nor Clinton as centrist. They have differences of degree, not direction.
MichaelSLinden	722615254707007489	2016-04-20T02:37:56	gabrielkahane He lost me at the second tweet. That's a straw man caricature of liberals. And it's not true of Hillary Clinton.
MichaelSLinden	722603197681049601	2016-04-20T01:50:02	Hey look, the exit polls just changed. They now show a 10 point Clinton victory (up from 4 in first wave).
MichaelSLinden	722600404563980288	2016-04-20T01:38:56	NBC News projects Clinton the winner of the NY Dem primary
MichaelSLinden	722599678089551872	2016-04-20T01:36:03	rjmedwed It's the disconnect between the early exit polls and the early results.
MichaelSLinden	722598786481184768	2016-04-20T01:32:30	Hillary now up by 100,000 votes.
MichaelSLinden	722586983286091776	2016-04-20T00:45:36	gabrielkahane Overall, I'd like to see the tone of the primary softened a bit. This isn't actually an epic struggle between light and dark.
MichaelSLinden	722586676074319872	2016-04-20T00:44:23	gabrielkahane I don't begrudge you your decision! Just responding to the specific "couple steps too far" argument.
MichaelSLinden	722584151333945347	2016-04-20T00:34:21	gabrielkahane Vote your conscience, of course, but no need to overstate. Sanders' relationship w/NRA isn't trading lives for votes either.

MichaelSLinden	722152141570367488	2016-04-18T19:57:42	Gosh. Since everything else about the country and the economy has stayed exactly the same, I guess taxes are bad. 
MichaelSLinden	720730366634541056	2016-04-14T21:48:04	nick_bunker You are bunk*er*, debt arguments that include calls for lower taxes are bunk*est*
MichaelSLinden	720729873946435588	2016-04-14T21:46:07	You know an argument about debt is bunk when it calls for lower taxes. If debt is so scary &amp; bad, surely higher taxes must be a lesser evil.

MichaelSLinden	720640095871741952	2016-04-14T15:49:22	MichaelSLinden That's like saying "It's best not to buy things."
MichaelSLinden	720639913696366592	2016-04-14T15:48:38	The first sentence is crazy facile: "This much I have learned about debt after 40 years of writing and study: It is better not to incur it"
MichaelSLinden	720637879404335104	2016-04-14T15:40:33	There is something wrong, misleading, facile or just plain dumb in nearly every paragraph of this TIME cover story.

MichaelSLinden	720615969614360576	2016-04-14T14:13:30	It's frustrating that not every economic concept can be distilled accurately onto a magazine cover. That doesn't mean we should do it anyway
MichaelSLinden	720587002362667008	2016-04-14T12:18:23	So wrong and dumb. Debt/person # is meaningless, &amp; having debt does not mean the U.S. is insolvent. Good grief. 
MichaelSLinden	720277056542486532	2016-04-13T15:46:47	"Congress can't pass budget" is empty attack no matter who's in charge. Congress does things it must do. budget resolution isn't one of them

MichaelSLinden	715507755344375808	2016-03-31T11:55:17	This is wrong. If an arsonist sets his own house on fire, you have to put it out, especially in a crowded area.

MichaelSLinden	710123402187636737	2016-03-16T15:19:47	mattyglesias He couldn't make it here today in time for the announcement because he's antiquing in Connecticut.
MichaelSLinden	709945845274255361	2016-03-16T03:34:14	YeaYouRite Uh, 93% reporting in Ohio. She's going to win there by 14 points.
MichaelSLinden	709943950950453248	2016-03-16T03:26:42	BTW, looks like Clinton is going to win a higher percentage in Ohio than she did in North Carolina. Kind of a narrative-killer, no?
MichaelSLinden	709934406685822977	2016-03-16T02:48:47	A reminder, because I am already seeing it here and there: HRC's ability to win OH says nothing about the general.
MichaelSLinden	709920634239901703	2016-03-16T01:54:03	Has anyone else noticed that Clinton is currently leading by more in Ohio than she is in North Carolina? Probably won't hold, but still.
MichaelSLinden	709912480890404865	2016-03-16T01:21:39	Congrats Ted_Strickland. A big big win in Ohio. He's going to beat DoYourJobRob. And he's going to be an outstanding senator.
MichaelSLinden	709911834460090368	2016-03-16T01:19:05	Tammy Duckworth is going to be an amazing United States Senator.
MichaelSLinden	709910391346823170	2016-03-16T01:13:21	Again with this. Blech. Anyway, I stand by what I said last time. ImWithHer but I still like wilw. 
MichaelSLinden	709906938348380160	2016-03-16T00:59:38	But with dynamic scoring, he can totally do it! 
MichaelSLinden	709906062678355968	2016-03-16T00:56:09	According to the New York Times, Clinton has already extended her delegate lead by 100 tonight.
MichaelSLinden	709904347044388864	2016-03-16T00:49:20	Updated exit polls now have Clinton winning by 10 points in Ohio. No wonder they called it.
MichaelSLinden	709893133706924033	2016-03-16T00:04:46	In Missouri, exit polls have Sanders up by 3. Again, caveat: these exit polls do change sometimes.
MichaelSLinden	709892746799161344	2016-03-16T00:03:14	Illinois exit polls have Sanders ahead 50-49. But obviously, that's too close to be meaningful right now.
MichaelSLinden	709888636934705152	2016-03-15T23:46:54	Another reminder for tonight: winning or losing a state in the primary says essentially nothing about one's ability to win it in the general
MichaelSLinden	709886946374524928	2016-03-15T23:40:11	KevinMFeeney For sure. If she gets huge win in FL, plus clear wins in NC and OH, that's a good night for her.
MichaelSLinden	709886567259701248	2016-03-15T23:38:41	Clinton up by 12 in North Carolina, according to exit polls. That's closer than the 20 point margin in last week's pre-election polls.
MichaelSLinden	709885485901029376	2016-03-15T23:34:23	First exits show Clinton leading by double-digits in NV (expected) &amp; by high single-digits in Ohio (less expected). Things can shift. Salt!
MichaelSLinden	709885403831132160	2016-03-15T23:34:03	Clinton and Sanders split white voters, per Ohio exit polls. Clinton won African American voters 73-26.
MichaelSLinden	709885043620057088	2016-03-15T23:32:38	According to Ohio exits, it's Clinton 53, Sanders 46. 7 point margin exactly in line with last week of pre-election polls.

MichaelSLinden	709511298535571456	2016-03-14T22:47:30	zachdcarter 100% agree.
MichaelSLinden	709510586967715849	2016-03-14T22:44:40	zachdcarter Another time, I'll happily debate who would be better at dealing with a GOP congress.
MichaelSLinden	709509084874186752	2016-03-14T22:38:42	zachdcarter But again, that wasn't my point.
MichaelSLinden	709509023473733633	2016-03-14T22:38:27	zachdcarter I also think it's not reading too much into the campaign to say that Clinton is far more open to incremental wins than he is.
MichaelSLinden	709508878845800451	2016-03-14T22:37:53	zachdcarter But he actually needs more than 2008, because Dems already controlled Congress.
MichaelSLinden	709508798310907904	2016-03-14T22:37:34	zachdcarter And when presented with evidence that that thing isn't happening, Sanders' answer was: Don't compare us to 2008.
MichaelSLinden	709508701506379776	2016-03-14T22:37:11	zachdcarter Again, that's not my point. My point is that Sanders has repeated pointed to a specific thing that will cut the gordian knot.
MichaelSLinden	709508010515767297	2016-03-14T22:34:26	zachdcarter That's actually not my point. My point is that Sanders has a specific answer for how he's going to pass his agenda.
MichaelSLinden	709507693896196097	2016-03-14T22:33:10	zachdcarter Not saying her platform becomes law. Saying that legislation will still pass, opportunities for wins still available.
MichaelSLinden	709507212171993092	2016-03-14T22:31:16	zachdcarter Hard to see, yes. But in the last year, Congress passed Medicare DocFix, permanent tax extenders, NCLB reform &amp; budget deal.
MichaelSLinden	709507016474161152	2016-03-14T22:30:29	zachdcarter Yes, but only Clinton acknowledges this. Sanders' answer is a "political revolution" that has not yet materialized.
MichaelSLinden	709505915708428288	2016-03-14T22:26:06	zachdcarter Respectfully disagree. Sanders explicitly depends on "political revolution." Clinton does not.
MichaelSLinden	709504191031599104	2016-03-14T22:19:15	In 2008, Dems already controlled House and Senate. Sanders' "political revolution" needs to be bigger than Obama's. 
MichaelSLinden	709499898278719488	2016-03-14T22:02:12	I can't say exactly why, but to me Hamilton represents everything about America that Trump isn't.

MichaelSLinden	707596344786067457	2016-03-09T15:58:09	If you really think a 2% difference in a primary means one candidate can win that state in the general and the other can't...then, well, ok.

MichaelSLinden	707388130404519936	2016-03-09T02:10:47	realShaneBogusz No worries. And those first posted exits aren't always right. They showed Sanders winning in MA, for example, at first.

MichaelSLinden	707280088786665473	2016-03-08T19:01:28	I feel like some people are forgetting that the Tea Party and fiery anti-Obama rhetoric began well before Obamacare. 
MichaelSLinden	707279543715950592	2016-03-08T18:59:18	And after Clinton abandoned health care reform, GOP opposition melted away and the next 6 years ran super smoothly. 
MichaelSLinden	707277749656948736	2016-03-08T18:52:10	For example, here's Sarah Palin warning that her son would be killed by "Obama's 'death panel,'" in September 2009. 
MichaelSLinden	707277316423086080	2016-03-08T18:50:27	Here's another huge problem with HotlineJosh's argument: look at the rhetoric GOP was using against Obama BEFORE ACA was passed. Toxic.
MichaelSLinden	707276591622180864	2016-03-08T18:47:34	I won't rant. I'll just suggest HotlineJosh should read Chapter 7 of my book on the DC Republican strategy.

MichaelSLinden	707274854911893504	2016-03-08T18:40:40	Here's FreedomWorks being really muted in its criticism of ARRA because it got 3 GOP votes. cc: HotlineJosh 
MichaelSLinden	707274084414001152	2016-03-08T18:37:36	This is amazing. I asked for evidence, and HotlineJosh cites an article from October 2010, written by HotlineJosh. 
MichaelSLinden	707273555973693441	2016-03-08T18:35:30	Actual evidence for this assertion would be nice. If it hadn't been ACA, they'd have focused on something else. 
MichaelSLinden	707272524585947137	2016-03-08T18:31:25	Half the reason liberals were pissed at Obama at the end of 2009 is he let Max Baucus negotiate health care for MONTHS to win GOP support.
MichaelSLinden	707272420009373696	2016-03-08T18:31:00	7/ Nothing about the ACA demanded that GOP use racially coded (and sometimes not so coded) language to try and tear Obama down.
MichaelSLinden	707272179742842880	2016-03-08T18:30:02	MichaelSLinden I generally find that if I have to say, "No, that's not a joke," then I need to think harder.
MichaelSLinden	707272072758743040	2016-03-08T18:29:37	6/ No reckoning at all with the fact that Obama bent over backwards to work with GOP after 2010 midterms. Got no credit, didn't help at all.
MichaelSLinden	707271711411011585	2016-03-08T18:28:11	5/ Total failure to mention that congressional Republicans pursued obstruction as a conscious strategy, planned even before inauguration.
MichaelSLinden	707271185881571328	2016-03-08T18:26:05	4/ Tea Party began as a reaction to Obama and Dems econ policies, well before ACA passed. Santelli's rant was in Feb 2009, remember?
MichaelSLinden	707270619398868992	2016-03-08T18:23:50	3/ No proof at all that Dems would have kept the House in 2010 had ACA never been passed. Literally offers no supporting evidence.
MichaelSLinden	707270419049533441	2016-03-08T18:23:03	2/ Obama got 3 GOP Senators to vote for the stimulus. That didn't stop Republicans from vilifying it.
MichaelSLinden	707270168871837696	2016-03-08T18:22:03	1/ This is some incredibly weak stuff. Logical leaps, unsupported assertions, and blinds spots abound. Here's a few. 
MichaelSLinden	707265820972474368	2016-03-08T18:04:46	No, no, you guys. HotlineJosh is right. Remember how the 3 GOP votes for the stimulus totally "muted" Republican antipathy to that bill.

MichaelSLinden	706852747228876800	2016-03-07T14:43:22	Ok, now for a more serious point: Trump's fiscal plans aren't all that different from most GOP plans.

MichaelSLinden	706695197955112960	2016-03-07T04:17:19	Econ_Marshall Maybe, but your phrasing wasn't better. It implies strongly that she should "shut her mouth." Not good at all.
MichaelSLinden	706693545781022720	2016-03-07T04:10:45	Econ_Marshall There may be other power dynamics at play too, but the gender one is very real. And that's the operative one in this case.
MichaelSLinden	706692611113885696	2016-03-07T04:07:02	Econ_Marshall Oy, Marshall. Want to try that response again without the unnecessary snark?
MichaelSLinden	706692211765854208	2016-03-07T04:05:27	Econ_Marshall Understood. But no one can avoid the gender dynamics of asking a woman not to interrupt a man. Better not to go there at all.
MichaelSLinden	706691446993195009	2016-03-07T04:02:25	Econ_Marshall No. "open your mouth" phrasing isn't better. It's best not to rely on old-timey gender roles (even unintentionally).
MichaelSLinden	706690727439421440	2016-03-07T03:59:33	Econ_Marshall That is not better.

MichaelSLinden	704881713252573184	2016-03-02T04:11:11	Clinton win in a state like Massachusetts means Sanders has virtually no chance of compensating for his huge deficit with black voters
MichaelSLinden	704876920568225792	2016-03-02T03:52:08	Sanders isn't going to win, but he could still have a big positive impact. Take campaign to state &amp; local races, help more progressives win.

MichaelSLinden	704862549834141696	2016-03-02T02:55:02	According to exits, Clinton won Latino voters in Texas 67-33. More evidence for the argument that she won Latinos in Nevada too.
MichaelSLinden	704858039501905921	2016-03-02T02:37:06	Serious question: Except for a clean Trump sweep, could this night have gone worse for Rubio?

MichaelSLinden	704851656429719552	2016-03-02T02:11:45	According to updated exits, Clinton and Sanders split white voters in Massachusetts. If that holds, it's pretty much game over for Sanders.
MichaelSLinden	704850786858221568	2016-03-02T02:08:17	Updated exit polls in MA now have Clinton pulling out a narrow victory there.
MichaelSLinden	704850311270236161	2016-03-02T02:06:24	The popular vote on the Democratic side so far is Clinton 62, Sanders 37
MichaelSLinden	704849831823601665	2016-03-02T02:04:30	Impressive wins for Clinton in VA &amp; GA where it looks like she will outperform the polling margins by between 10 and 20 points.
MichaelSLinden	704846958918279168	2016-03-02T01:53:05	Interesting that UpshotNYT's live model has Clinton doing a lot better in MA than the exits say. Thoughts, Nate_Cohn?
MichaelSLinden	704846406050291716	2016-03-02T01:50:53	Earlier tonight, it looked like four different GOP candidates might win states. Now, it looks like just Trump and Cruz.
MichaelSLinden	704836906417299456	2016-03-02T01:13:08	According to exits, voters under the age of 30 saved Sanders in MA. Clinton slightly ahead among everyone over age 30.
MichaelSLinden	704836459442917376	2016-03-02T01:11:21	The idea that low Dem turnout in primaries will mean low turnout in the general is absurd. Dems would stay home vs Trump, really? Pfft.
MichaelSLinden	704835004262649856	2016-03-02T01:05:34	According to exits, Clinton on track to win Alabama by 45 points. Weren't a ton of polls there, but that's about what they said to expect.
MichaelSLinden	704834432214155265	2016-03-02T01:03:18	If exits are right, Sanders is going to win Massachusetts by about 7 points. Huge gender gap, with Sanders +24 among men, -6 among women.
MichaelSLinden	704826146257543172	2016-03-02T00:30:22	If exits are right, Trump is going to win VA by about 3 points, which is way way closer than the 14 pt margin predicted by the polls.
MichaelSLinden	704825661072998400	2016-03-02T00:28:27	If exits are right, Trump is on track to win in Georgia by 17, which is maybe a hair larger than the pre-election polling margin.
MichaelSLinden	704824077593255936	2016-03-02T00:22:09	In Vermont, Sanders is on track to win by about 70 pts, which is exactly in line with the (admittedly sparse) pre-election polling.
MichaelSLinden	704823347767549952	2016-03-02T00:19:15	Same with GA. If exits are right, Clinton's margin will be about 5 points better than final pre-election polls.
MichaelSLinden	704822798015979520	2016-03-02T00:17:04	If exits are right, Clinton on track to win by 25 points in Virginia, a little better than the 20 pt spread predicted by the polls.
MichaelSLinden	704821926481494016	2016-03-02T00:13:36	According to VA exits, Clinton won both men and women, both white voters and African Americans, and all age groups over 30.

MichaelSLinden	704697336228872192	2016-03-01T15:58:32	I tend to think Sanders would totally beat Trump, but this is silly &amp; useless. (&amp; BTW "latest poll"=cherry picking).

MichaelSLinden	704391510746386432	2016-02-29T19:43:17	My hunch is that black turnout will remain stable, Latino turnout will go up slightly, and Dems will increase vote share relative to 2012.
MichaelSLinden	704391088791015424	2016-02-29T19:41:37	jbouie This is why it's so hard for me to see him winning. He needs overall electorate to go back in time + historic share of white voters.
MichaelSLinden	704390670136569861	2016-02-29T19:39:57	jbouie But even that is somewhat generous to Trump, right? Given recent WaPo/Latino Decisions polls, for example.

MichaelSLinden	702682093340508160	2016-02-25T02:30:40	Note that Trump (like Sanders) has never faced full-out attack from other side, which makes his general election poll numbers unreliable.
MichaelSLinden	702543833377193984	2016-02-24T17:21:17	ernietedeschi Agreed. Good point. It's all about poking the right people in the eye.
MichaelSLinden	702542581994012674	2016-02-24T17:16:18	ernietedeschi That's because "tells it like it is" actually means "Says things that I agree with &amp; are unpopular with the right people"

MichaelSLinden	699993866653540352	2016-02-17T16:28:37	I think there are definitely some intriguing similarities between the SCOTUS fight and the debt limit fights.

MichaelSLinden	699806574081138688	2016-02-17T04:04:23	ernietedeschi jbarro Also here: 
MichaelSLinden	699805523558973441	2016-02-17T04:00:13	ernietedeschi Agree. Although, as jbarro points out, it's not technically life-cycle, it's accrual method.
MichaelSLinden	699805292436058112	2016-02-17T03:59:18	@Fake_Buffett Good tip. Thanks!
MichaelSLinden	699805230142251008	2016-02-17T03:59:03	jbarro And shouldn't we be concerned that the two methods give such hugely different answers?
MichaelSLinden	699804923723194369	2016-02-17T03:57:50	jbarro But they do (even if they don't know it) in that year. Kind of weird to do point-in-time dist tables based on lifetime effects.
MichaelSLinden	699804323337936896	2016-02-17T03:55:27	ernietedeschi Yes, I think so. But probably, even in those cases, wage method is gonna look flatter than consumption method.
MichaelSLinden	699804020634972160	2016-02-17T03:54:14	jbarro I think there's also something to the argument that consumption method is much closer to the way people actually experience the tax.
MichaelSLinden	699803452273246209	2016-02-17T03:51:59	jbarro Not entirely disagreeing with, but I think a broad consumption tax isn't the same as a narrow retirement tax break.
MichaelSLinden	699801726321299456	2016-02-17T03:45:07	jbarro Maybe "problem" was the wrong word. "Wrinkle," would have been better probably.
MichaelSLinden	699801492463751168	2016-02-17T03:44:12	MicahGibson Yes, and that's exactly how TPC models it.
MichaelSLinden	699801179363139584	2016-02-17T03:42:57	15/ This tweetstorm was either 100% awesome or only 35% awesome, depending on how you model it. The end.
MichaelSLinden	699800689413718017	2016-02-17T03:41:00	14/ They have their reasons for using that method, but keep it in mind when you look at the distribution of Ted Cruz’s plan (or any VAT).
MichaelSLinden	699800525303369728	2016-02-17T03:40:21	13/ The Tax Policy Center uses the wage+existing equity method, and that makes the distributional effects of the VAT look relatively flat.
MichaelSLinden	699800394227171333	2016-02-17T03:39:50	12/ Under the wage method, same  VAT is more like 13% for both bottom and top 1%. So, it’s pretty important which method you use.
MichaelSLinden	699800244624695297	2016-02-17T03:39:14	11/ Using the consumption method, 20% VAT is actually a 70% tax on bottom quintile, but only 3% tax on richest 1%. 
MichaelSLinden	699800123879120897	2016-02-17T03:38:45	10/ But the important point is that theoretical decisions about how to model a VAT make a huge difference in distributional tables.
MichaelSLinden	699799793313386496	2016-02-17T03:37:27	9/ One problem, for example, with the “wage” method is that the distributed tax burden doesn’t add up to actual revenue in a given year.
MichaelSLinden	699799706768142336	2016-02-17T03:37:06	8/ Neither method is “right.” Both have advantages/drawbacks. There are lots of reasons why modeling a consumption tax is hard.
MichaelSLinden	699799649020997632	2016-02-17T03:36:52	7/ That method makes the VAT look pretty flat, since everyone’s income takes roughly the same percentage hit.
MichaelSLinden	699799385044033537	2016-02-17T03:35:49	6/ Wage method: Model the VAT as effectively reducing the value of wages (and existing capital) because those $ can buy less b/c of the VAT.
MichaelSLinden	699799141950611457	2016-02-17T03:34:51	5/ That method makes the VAT look super regressive, since poor people spend &gt;100% of their income &amp; rich people spend significantly &lt;100%.
MichaelSLinden	699799059889004544	2016-02-17T03:34:32	4/ Consumption method: model the tax as it is directly experienced. When people make purchases, that's when they bear the burden of the tax.
MichaelSLinden	699798872655319041	2016-02-17T03:33:47	3/ There are basically 2 main ways to model the distributional consequences of a VAT: the consumption method or the wage+equity method.
MichaelSLinden	699798743260991488	2016-02-17T03:33:16	2/ Since Ted Cruz’s tax plan contains a VAT (he doesn’t call it that, but that’s what it is), there’s renewed interest in who it affects.
MichaelSLinden	699798541812764672	2016-02-17T03:32:28	1/ Batten down the hatches, there’s a super wonky tweetstorm a-brewin’ re: modeling the distributional consequences of a Value Added Tax.

MichaelSLinden	699704004847280128	2016-02-16T21:16:49	chrisFnicholson But then I would have been responding to a nonexistent piece. My post was a direct response to what he actually wrote.

MichaelSLinden	698203234503127040	2016-02-12T17:53:17	YeaYouRite No, they both start downward at around the same time. There's a graph earlier in my tweetstorm.
MichaelSLinden	698202570930651136	2016-02-12T17:50:39	YeaYouRite Yes. Same with U3. And both have improved a lot since then.

MichaelSLinden	698199682535854082	2016-02-12T17:39:10	But with context, the U6 tells basically the same story as the U3. Unemployment has dropped significantly in last 5 years. (14/14)
MichaelSLinden	698199562633216000	2016-02-12T17:38:42	Citing U6 without context is inescapably misleading, because the public usually only ever hears about the U3 rate. (13/14)
MichaelSLinden	698199446614601728	2016-02-12T17:38:14	So if you want to use the U6 as the “real/better” unemployment rate, that’s ok. But you can’t implicitly benchmark it to the U3. (12/14)
MichaelSLinden	698199275445088256	2016-02-12T17:37:33	During the Bush expansion, U6 never got lower than 7.9%, and it reached 17.1% in the aftermath of the recession. (11/14)
MichaelSLinden	698199206100647941	2016-02-12T17:37:17	The U6 has always been higher--on avg about 4.7 pts higher--than the U3, because it measures something slightly different. (10/14)
MichaelSLinden	698198997836701700	2016-02-12T17:36:27	The correlation between the U3 (official rate) and U6 (broader measurement) is 0.987. In other words, nearly perfect. (9/14)
MichaelSLinden	698198919021465600	2016-02-12T17:36:08	But here’s the thing, while the levels of those 4 rates are different, the trends are basically identical. (8/14) 
MichaelSLinden	698198758220288000	2016-02-12T17:35:30	BLS puts out four different numbers (U3, U4, U5, U6) that one could plausibly claim is the “real” rate. U3 is the official one. (7/14)
MichaelSLinden	698198665081528321	2016-02-12T17:35:08	Putting aside the dumb ways, there are a bunch of fine ways to define unemployment, but they mean different things. (6/14)
MichaelSLinden	698198531400724480	2016-02-12T17:34:36	My 3-year-old son is doesn’t work but he’s not “unemployed.” I mean, sure, I wish he would contribute more, but c’mon. (5/14)
MichaelSLinden	698198403805745152	2016-02-12T17:34:06	1-EPOP is super dumb b/c, obviously, there are lots of people who don’t work but aren’t unemployed. E.g. the elderly. (4/14)
MichaelSLinden	698198289997549568	2016-02-12T17:33:38	Dumb way: (1 – employment to population ratio). The EPOP just takes the number of employed people and divides it by total people. (3/14)
MichaelSLinden	698198047965245441	2016-02-12T17:32:41	First of all, there are several different, totally reasonable ways to measure “unemployment.” There are also some really dumb ways. (2/14)

MichaelSLinden	698197530887221248	2016-02-12T17:30:37	JNicholsonInDC Disagree. Doc fix went further than periodic patch. Same with tax deal. Essa doesn't fit that description at all.
MichaelSLinden	698183261781106688	2016-02-12T16:33:55	In 2015: ESSA, Doc Fix, budget deal, tax deal, highways, trafficking. Not Pure wins, but lots of good. (2/2) 
MichaelSLinden	698182830657007616	2016-02-12T16:32:13	I think this is right. But we are underestimating possibility of meaningful change, even with a GOP congress (1/2).

MichaelSLinden	697915162376978432	2016-02-11T22:48:36	7im Agreed. I was expecting that, given the rhetoric leading up to it. Feels like more evidence the plan designers really believe it.

MichaelSLinden	697854453093900288	2016-02-11T18:47:21	Who gets the lion's share of Rubio's $6.8 trillion tax cut? Well, the richest 0.1% (take note of the decimal point) gets 20% of it.
MichaelSLinden	697853222720036865	2016-02-11T18:42:28	jonathanchait 1) $8.2 includes the additional interest payments on the added debt from the $6.8 direct revenue loss.

MichaelSLinden	697848398435762177	2016-02-11T18:23:18	jimtankersley That is not a huge caveat. Growth effects likely to be swamped by negative effects of additional debt/massive spending cuts.
MichaelSLinden	697847939201417216	2016-02-11T18:21:28	This is 100% true. The GOP has been living in fantasyland for a long while now. Sanders is a new resident. 
MichaelSLinden	697847583406952449	2016-02-11T18:20:03	Bernie’s tax plans exist on a separate plane from political feasibility. But *establishment* GOP tax plans are detached from reality, too.

MichaelSLinden	697428649314775040	2016-02-10T14:35:22	I'm not sure. The primary breakdowns don't predict the general very well. Remember OH, PA, FL in '08?

MichaelSLinden	697160997895827457	2016-02-09T20:51:49	And remember, capital assets subject to tax are owned almost entirely by very rich households. 
MichaelSLinden	697160415000858624	2016-02-09T20:49:30	By the way, like-kind exchanges let people defer capital gains tax when they sell some types of assets, if they also buy a similar asset.

MichaelSLinden	695442773739225088	2016-02-05T03:04:12	Uh huh. Really? Tell me more about how you'd like her voice to sound to you. 
MichaelSLinden	695436106628661249	2016-02-05T02:37:43	Good Q from chucktodd and good follow up on why Sanders rejected public financing. Also shows that Sanders is not Mr Purity.
MichaelSLinden	694984568374435840	2016-02-03T20:43:27	chrislhayes B) "Progressive" assumes actual progress. Harder to get that, the further out you go.
MichaelSLinden	694984175535964161	2016-02-03T20:41:54	chrislhayes I don't think so. A) You get far enough left, you lose a lot of progressive values (not saying Sanders is there).
MichaelSLinden	694983307948384256	2016-02-03T20:38:27	furthest left ≠ most progressive
MichaelSLinden	694982445691613184	2016-02-03T20:35:01	Maybe some day working tirelessly to improve the lives of women around the world will count as 'progressive'.
MichaelSLinden	694605857380655108	2016-02-02T19:38:36	The overriding theme to Clinton’s time in public life is that she’s Not Doing It Right — whatever she’s doing, however she’s doing it.
MichaelSLinden	694596177606623232	2016-02-02T19:00:08	I’m excited at the prospect of expanding access to retirement savings plans. But be careful of fees! 
MichaelSLinden	694562839806283777	2016-02-02T16:47:40	In the last yr fighting for women's constitutionally protected health care rights has felt a lot like GroundhogDay 
MichaelSLinden	694527711147073536	2016-02-02T14:28:04	Remember the bruising '08 primary? Remember PUMAs? Remember PA, OH, &amp; FL?  89% of Ds voted for Obama in the general, &amp; he won all 3 states.
MichaelSLinden	694526094167425024	2016-02-02T14:21:39	The thing you would miss watching the Twitter fights is that most Democrats like both Clinton and Sanders.
MichaelSLinden	694384137235472385	2016-02-02T04:57:34	Serious question, though. If Sanders does win (or he wins NH), will he be the first non-Christian candidate to win a primary/caucus?
MichaelSLinden	694382555437502464	2016-02-02T04:51:16	It'd be awesome if Bernie folks could just love their Bernie without transforming Clinton into a bizarro comic-book villain caricature.
MichaelSLinden	694369742900072449	2016-02-02T04:00:22	rjmedwed I know, mine too.
MichaelSLinden	694369619495260160	2016-02-02T03:59:52	rjmedwed I guess it depends on how you define "diverse."
MichaelSLinden	694369281274986496	2016-02-02T03:58:32	Thing is, Sanders needs non-white voters to take a second look at him. Big win in Iowa + NH maybe gets him that. 
MichaelSLinden	694369107253293057	2016-02-02T03:57:50	Narratives aside, a tie is a win for Clinton. Sanders needs 2x HRC's delegates to be on track for nom -- Redistrict 
MichaelSLinden	694368471539408898	2016-02-02T03:55:19	Because the pre-election polls did show it being really tight, with a few percent going to O'Malley.
MichaelSLinden	694368315695874048	2016-02-02T03:54:41	Are people surprised by the narrowness of the Dem race because earlier in the night it was looking like a relatively easy Clinton win?

MichaelSLinden	693955101577330688	2016-02-01T00:32:43	This is what I'm talking about. 
MichaelSLinden	693954594674753537	2016-02-01T00:30:43	4/ Again, I don't think this applies to all, or even most, Sanders supporters. But I've seen it a lot and it feels different from 2008.

MichaelSLinden	693953619876536320	2016-02-01T00:26:50	2/ However, what I have noticed is that many Sanders supporters take the least charitable view possible of Clinton. They assume the worst.
MichaelSLinden	693953334714175488	2016-02-01T00:25:42	1/ I, myself, have not experienced the "Bernie Bro" phenomenon (perhaps, in part, because I am a male Clinton supporter).

MichaelSLinden	693098116497694720	2016-01-29T15:47:22	richardmskinner Fair, but he might also be much higher than 50% for the nom, right?
MichaelSLinden	693097085416181760	2016-01-29T15:43:16	Yeah. If Trump's at &gt;50% for GOP nom, and GOP has 40-50% of winning WH, then Trump's POTUS chance is ~25%. Yikes.

MichaelSLinden	692551662280507394	2016-01-28T03:35:57	AneeceColt Nope. Number 1. She deserves it.
MichaelSLinden	692551517707046913	2016-01-28T03:35:23	1. Buffy  Yes, Buffy. There's a reason this show is a classic and is so influential, and Buffy is a big reason. Props to SarahMichelleGG.
MichaelSLinden	692551219303313408	2016-01-28T03:34:12	2. Anya  The show doesn't really hit its stride until "The Wish," and Anya just gets better ("It might be bunnies!"). Her fate destroyed me.
MichaelSLinden	692550768990228480	2016-01-28T03:32:24	3. Spike  Yes, the scene where Buffy and Spike literally destroy a house is cringe-worthy, but Spike is indispensable by the end.
MichaelSLinden	692550486810034176	2016-01-28T03:31:17	4. Willow  Why didn't alydenisof ever get an Emmy nomination? Willow episodes always amazing (maybe except for Wrecked). Willow's the glue.
MichaelSLinden	692549635315990529	2016-01-28T03:27:54	TOP 5 5. Giles  Wise, supportive, caring, lets the Gang be themselves and grow into awesome people. Good job, Rupert!
MichaelSLinden	692549406705520643	2016-01-28T03:27:00	6. Faith  Sure, she turns bad in season 3, but admit it, she was crazy fun to watch. Huge energy and she gets it right in the end.
MichaelSLinden	692549101771210752	2016-01-28T03:25:47	7. Xander  Obviously core member, but not top 5 because his act gets a little old. And he leaves Anya at the altar. Not cool.
MichaelSLinden	692548357227745280	2016-01-28T03:22:49	8. Robin  Late entrant, but super charismatic addition. More time on the show and he might be even higher on the list.
MichaelSLinden	692548170308571141	2016-01-28T03:22:05	9. Tara  Fits well into the gang even though she enters halfway in. Her death is devastating.
MichaelSLinden	692547852514541568	2016-01-28T03:20:49	10. Jenny  Smart, brave, witty and complicated. Killed off too early to be higher on the list.
MichaelSLinden	692547473374584834	2016-01-28T03:19:19	11. Angel  Another one who grows into something way better on the spinoff. And it didn't help that Angelus was more interesting than Angel.
MichaelSLinden	692547228850884609	2016-01-28T03:18:20	12. Cordelia  Like Wesley, she is a much better character on "Angel." Too one-note on "Buffy."
MichaelSLinden	692547017260793856	2016-01-28T03:17:30	13. Kendra  Had potential, but got killed off too quickly to really make a mark.
MichaelSLinden	692546905553903617	2016-01-28T03:17:03	14. Wesley  He grows into one of the best characters on "Angel," but on "Buffy" he's a mess. And the Cordelia flirtation is icky as heck.
MichaelSLinden	692546661151801345	2016-01-28T03:16:05	15. Dawn  She's terrible at first. Then gets slightly less terrible later on.
MichaelSLinden	692546453613445125	2016-01-28T03:15:16	16. Riley  Oy, Riley. Boring, occasionally annoying.
MichaelSLinden	692546274722209793	2016-01-28T03:14:33	17. Oz  The so-stoic-it's-funny act was never that funny. And he broke Willow's heart.

MichaelSLinden	692382815527276544	2016-01-27T16:25:01	ddayen Fair enough. I agree with that. FWIW, here's my policy case for a bit more pragmatism: 
MichaelSLinden	692377500836614144	2016-01-27T16:03:54	ddayen And of course the only way that happened was in the context of the ACA, which you demean as "cautious centrism."
MichaelSLinden	692377050783563776	2016-01-27T16:02:07	Also ddayen mischaracterizes the "pragmatists." It's that boundary-pushing (not confined to immediately possible) &gt; boundary-ignoring.
MichaelSLinden	692376217891270656	2016-01-27T15:58:48	In arguing for the Sanders blue-sky approach, ddayen uses an example when Sanders built on an existing program.

MichaelSLinden	692059300924133376	2016-01-26T18:59:29	Pat_Garofalo That's true, but not relevant. The point is, you can fund a pretty expansive agenda just from tax increases on the rich.
MichaelSLinden	692055323696316416	2016-01-26T18:43:41	Pat_Garofalo I think you are underselling how much $$ can be raised from those making over $250,000.

MichaelSLinden	692039989916495872	2016-01-26T17:42:45	The "argument" that the stimulus failed is based entirely on one bad prediction from early 2009. The case for success is deep and broad.
MichaelSLinden	692039794420011008	2016-01-26T17:41:59	Chait is almost too kind here. Tons of post hoc evidence, &amp; also tons of "modeling the counterfactual" evidence too.

MichaelSLinden	690520021534183424	2016-01-22T13:02:57	Why JohnCassidy thinks Bernie Sanders needs to get more specific about his policy proposals: 
MichaelSLinden	690535721648680961	2016-01-22T14:05:20	Must read by MichaelSLinden “The four policy reasons why I support Hillary Clinton in the Democratic Primary.” 
MichaelSLinden	690527043793108992	2016-01-22T13:30:51	Conservatives run for office on the idea that government doesn't work. Then they get elected and prove it. 
MichaelSLinden	690376451808464897	2016-01-22T03:32:27	4. Clinton’s ideas are based on building and improving, ensuring that risks to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged are minimized.
MichaelSLinden	690376377439252480	2016-01-22T03:32:09	3. Clinton’s policies are rooted in evidence and data, even when the more popular position might have been otherwise.

MichaelSLinden	690376155942273025	2016-01-22T03:31:16	2. Clinton’s proposals do a far better job of confronting trade-offs and setting priorities.
MichaelSLinden	690375976694456320	2016-01-22T03:30:34	1. Clinton's agenda is boundary-pushing (rather than boundary-ignoring). That makes meaningful change more likely.

MichaelSLinden	690256120280158209	2016-01-21T19:34:18	Clinton wants to raise min wage to highest level in 50 years, close tax loopholes for very rich &amp; get rid of Hyde:

MichaelSLinden	690232796015652865	2016-01-21T18:01:37	climatebrad Bad comparison. Congress was already D in 2008. And his agenda was much more Clinton-like than Sanders-like.

MichaelSLinden	690226541339475968	2016-01-21T17:36:45	Can someone explain to me here how "mansplaining" is in any way an appropriate description of what I wrote? 
MichaelSLinden	690224233906069504	2016-01-21T17:27:35	The policy that's furthest to the left isn't necessarily the one that's the most progressive.

MichaelSLinden	689923680160333825	2016-01-20T21:33:18	MarcGoldwein zachmoller Yeah, probably 90% in California.
MichaelSLinden	689923173228417025	2016-01-20T21:31:17	MarcGoldwein Oh gosh, I don't have much confidence in his revenue estimates. Interaction effects alone seem huge.
MichaelSLinden	689922729542324224	2016-01-20T21:29:31	MarcGoldwein Agreed. Just trying to get as close to the right understanding of his plan as possible.
MichaelSLinden	689921559985782784	2016-01-20T21:24:52	MarcGoldwein Do you understand his 2.2 "income based premium" to apply to cap gains? I can't tell.
MichaelSLinden	689920657057005569	2016-01-20T21:21:17	MarcGoldwein Yup, that seems right. I forgot HI. On cap gains, did you include his additional 6% tax for SS?
MichaelSLinden	689918984729313280	2016-01-20T21:14:38	MarcGoldwein Can you lay out your top rate math? Not saying it's wrong, but I must be missing 6 points or so somewhere.
MichaelSLinden	689917218105204737	2016-01-20T21:07:37	MarcGoldwein I'm pretty sure you know that I know how to do that math. Just as I'm pretty sure you know that nominal is meaningless here.
MichaelSLinden	689915547467792386	2016-01-20T21:00:59	MarcGoldwein Fine, say that. But you and I both know it's super misleading to say the deficit is going to triple.
MichaelSLinden	689898830314115080	2016-01-20T19:54:33	Libs are not immune to the No True Scotsman fallacy.
MichaelSLinden	689845925418831872	2016-01-20T16:24:19	Yes, the budget picture got a bit worse, but please ignore all dire warnings that involve deficit or debt figures in nominal amounts.
MichaelSLinden	688954838030352384	2016-01-18T05:23:28	LouiseNorris larry_levitt Employers send the check, but the incidence of the tax falls on employees. Same as existing payroll taxes.
MichaelSLinden	688951689106313216	2016-01-18T05:10:57	Sanders’ plan seems not-so-favorable to employed Medicaid recipients.
MichaelSLinden	688950378038214656	2016-01-18T05:05:44	larry_levitt t3703 Also many CHIP families could see higher net OOP costs. Main point: winners &amp; losers not so simple to identify, right?
MichaelSLinden	688948678309089280	2016-01-18T04:58:59	LouiseNorris larry_levitt But employees bear the burden of the employer-side payroll tax. Employers remit the tax, but employees pay it.
MichaelSLinden	688933371750289409	2016-01-18T03:58:10	That was a high-minded debate that explored a number of important policy nuances.  Imagine if we had two parties that were capable of that.

MichaelSLinden	688929360976424964	2016-01-18T03:42:14	Wouldn't a lot of families on Medicaid pay more under Bernie's single-payer plan than they do now (b/c of 6.2% employer-side tax)?
MichaelSLinden	688926675392942080	2016-01-18T03:31:33	"None of this matters b/c the GOP will control the House" is a dodge. No one predicted DocFix, BBA2, ESSA this year. Future is hard to see.
MichaelSLinden	688923402774663169	2016-01-18T03:18:33	I will say this: the Sanders tax plan is still more realistic than any of the GOP fantasy-land tax plans.
MichaelSLinden	688921382068047873	2016-01-18T03:10:31	If we were really able to raise an additional $1 trillion a year in revenue, there are better things to spend that $$ on than single-payer.
MichaelSLinden	688920494654001152	2016-01-18T03:07:00	Balancing a state budget during a recession is not something to brag about.
MichaelSLinden	688920147801849857	2016-01-18T03:05:37	I'm not crying for households who make more than $10 million, but I think we're pretty much in fantasy land here.
MichaelSLinden	688919877235687425	2016-01-18T03:04:32	But actually, since Bernie is also for scrapping the SS contribution cap, his real top rate would be well above 70.
MichaelSLinden	688919201508147200	2016-01-18T03:01:51	If I'm reading this right, the top effective marginal tax rate under Bernie's plan would be a little above 60 percent.
MichaelSLinden	686992613304602626	2016-01-12T19:26:17	ernietedeschi MarcGoldwein That's a good point too.
MichaelSLinden	686990477405630464	2016-01-12T19:17:48	MarcGoldwein That's a great point. Maybe the real distinction is mandatory vs. discretionary.

MichaelSLinden	685162394088259584	2016-01-07T18:13:39	aaron_hedlund And I agree that what you do with the money matters as much (sometimes more) than pure tax distributional imact.
MichaelSLinden	685162192052813824	2016-01-07T18:12:50	aaron_hedlund But the rest of their income is taxed at the lower rates. Your plan has a much narrower base, exempting trillions.
MichaelSLinden	685161671518744577	2016-01-07T18:10:46	aaron_hedlund Given our discussion so far, that does not surprise me That's not a knock, by the way. Just that its consistent with your POV
MichaelSLinden	685161043224584194	2016-01-07T18:08:17	aaron_hedlund ScottElliotG But there is nothing inherently better about fewer rates. Agree on broader base. rates not connected to base.
MichaelSLinden	685160816757313536	2016-01-07T18:07:23	aaron_hedlund ScottElliotG Agreed, and I'm not expecting you to defend it to the death. And I conceded your original point.
MichaelSLinden	685160453442564096	2016-01-07T18:05:56	aaron_hedlund ScottElliotG Furthermore, rich people's first $50K isn't exempt, collecting even more.
MichaelSLinden	685160282449133571	2016-01-07T18:05:15	aaron_hedlund ScottElliotG Then, instead of collecting zero from the bottom 40%, you collect some. Overall revenue need lower.
MichaelSLinden	685160149191909378	2016-01-07T18:04:43	aaron_hedlund ScottElliotG No, I don't think so. Imagine if, instead of huge deduction, you have many smaller rates.
MichaelSLinden	685159959382867968	2016-01-07T18:03:58	aaron_hedlund ScottElliotG That's my point exactly. All the "efficiency" work here is done by that, not by the rate structure.
MichaelSLinden	685159610626502656	2016-01-07T18:02:35	aaron_hedlund ScottElliotG But under your plan, most people are taxed at ZERO. Multiple rates allows you to target the revenue gains.
MichaelSLinden	685159368967491585	2016-01-07T18:01:37	aaron_hedlund ScottElliotG There's no link between number of rates and breath of base.
MichaelSLinden	685159048371638272	2016-01-07T18:00:21	aaron_hedlund ScottElliotG No. Why? That's just totally wrong. Could apply multiple rates to exact same base.
MichaelSLinden	685158685593698304	2016-01-07T17:58:54	aaron_hedlund ScottElliotG And you are ignoring the legitimate political economy concerns I raised about this.
MichaelSLinden	685158600562573314	2016-01-07T17:58:34	aaron_hedlund ScottElliotG The efficiency comes from you income definition and lack of tax expenditures. Not the single rate.
MichaelSLinden	685158348858245120	2016-01-07T17:57:34	aaron_hedlund ScottElliotG I'll say again, multiple rates don't add either complexity or bad incentives. And top rate is higher w/o them.
MichaelSLinden	685158065189064704	2016-01-07T17:56:27	aaron_hedlund ScottElliotG I don't either of those options are good policy or realistic.
MichaelSLinden	685157952228061184	2016-01-07T17:56:00	aaron_hedlund ScottElliotG Honestly, that's just about as realistic a thought experiment as your flat tax.
MichaelSLinden	685156382790795268	2016-01-07T17:49:45	aaron_hedlund ScottElliotG I concur that limits the debate, and, at especially at the extremes, yields really wrong answers.
MichaelSLinden	685156219254902784	2016-01-07T17:49:06	aaron_hedlund ScottElliotG And since we don't agree (on either magnitude or direction), keeping to static effects makes sense.
MichaelSLinden	685155564645683201	2016-01-07T17:46:30	aaron_hedlund ScottElliotG Yes, I understand what you're saying. I agree that econ effects matter. I'm saying, we don't agree on the econ.
MichaelSLinden	685154237542707200	2016-01-07T17:41:14	aaron_hedlund ScottElliotG But we don't agree on the economic impacts, so not worth bringing it into this.
MichaelSLinden	685154085847351296	2016-01-07T17:40:38	aaron_hedlund My point is that more rates would make it easier, under your plan, to have a lower top rate.
MichaelSLinden	685153341605867522	2016-01-07T17:37:40	aaron_hedlund ScottElliotG Not going down that rabbit hole. We simply don't agree on either magnitude or direction. No worth debating here
MichaelSLinden	685153087774932992	2016-01-07T17:36:40	aaron_hedlund But you could do all those things, but with multiple rates, and therefor have better targeting. One rate offers no benefit.
MichaelSLinden	685152425100079106	2016-01-07T17:34:02	ScottElliotG aaron_hedlund Agreed, but I think you have to compare proposals to the status quo. Who pays more? Who pays less?
MichaelSLinden	685147740238692354	2016-01-07T17:15:25	ScottElliotG aaron_hedlund Totally. But in my analysis, I used the whole base. So base broadening not enough to mirror distribution.
MichaelSLinden	685146590307311616	2016-01-07T17:10:51	ScottElliotG aaron_hedlund TPC's expanded cash income is pretty close to broadest possible base.
MichaelSLinden	685146240141627392	2016-01-07T17:09:27	aaron_hedlund Income data comes from here:  That 21% rate includes corporate + excise.
MichaelSLinden	685131104941117440	2016-01-07T16:09:19	And he didn't. Fiscal situation dramatically improved from when he made those comments. Not solved, but much better. 
MichaelSLinden	685119999824953344	2016-01-07T15:25:11	Pat_Garofalo Thanks, Pat! Dipping my toe back in the writing waters.
MichaelSLinden	685118573237395456	2016-01-07T15:19:31	What the Tax Foundation's analysis shows, in stark detail, is that conservative econ ideology really does think only the rich matter.
MichaelSLinden	685118290587467776	2016-01-07T15:18:24	Tax Foundation: Raising taxes on bottom 90% + huge tax cuts for the rich = economic growth.  
MichaelSLinden	685118361299226624	2016-01-07T15:18:40	JosephOnions It's not news to me. Usually they hide behind tax cuts for everyone, with the rich being merely biggest beneficiaries.
MichaelSLinden	685117384898785281	2016-01-07T15:14:48	JosephOnions Absolutely. It's just rare that we get such stark evidence that they really believe only tax rates for the top matter.
MichaelSLinden	685116620835024896	2016-01-07T15:11:45	JosephOnions Lower.
MichaelSLinden	685116570184626176	2016-01-07T15:11:33	ernietedeschi Seriously, I think the AP should absolutely accept a rap battle in lieu of a DBQ.
MichaelSLinden	685116270757457920	2016-01-07T15:10:22	Tax Foundation's dynamic model finds that a plan which raises taxes on the bottom 90% yields large positive econ effects. Think about that.
MichaelSLinden	685112843776208896	2016-01-07T14:56:45	ernietedeschi Oh, no I didn't. I just go straight to Hamilton now for anything remotely connected to the revolution and early US.
MichaelSLinden	685112275091472384	2016-01-07T14:54:29	ernietedeschi And really, the American Revolution was actually a war between talented Hip Hop artists and a King who preferred Brit Pop.
MichaelSLinden	685085811285569539	2016-01-07T13:09:20	I wrote a thing about flat taxes and progressivity, in response to a long twitter discussion with aaron_hedlund: 
MichaelSLinden	684985896127574017	2016-01-07T06:32:18	aaron_hedlund I wrote a longer post on this topic. I hope you'll find it both interesting and fair. 
MichaelSLinden	684876632700641280	2016-01-06T23:18:08	aaron_hedlund That's a huge and unsupported jump from "can have a flat tax with deduction &amp; EITC that doesn't hurt the poor."
MichaelSLinden	684876059754508288	2016-01-06T23:15:51	aaron_hedlund I'd also just say that a "flat" tax with a huge standard deduction isn't really a flat tax. it's a 2 bracket system.
MichaelSLinden	684875889570639873	2016-01-06T23:15:11	aaron_hedlund Narrowly defined, yes. Disagree when expanded to general progressivity + revenue neutrality.
MichaelSLinden	684875646665883648	2016-01-06T23:14:13	aaron_hedlund So I maintain that you can't have both.
MichaelSLinden	684875540130586624	2016-01-06T23:13:47	aaron_hedlund And I'll say again, that sacrifices revenue.
MichaelSLinden	684875398128205825	2016-01-06T23:13:13	aaron_hedlund And I've never seen a proposal with that high of a standard deduction and that high of a rate.
MichaelSLinden	684875098176786432	2016-01-06T23:12:02	aaron_hedlund I mean, i could say let's have a system with a $10 mil exemption, and then an 80% rate. Sure, that's not regressive.
MichaelSLinden	684874795121553408	2016-01-06T23:10:50	aaron_hedlund That's not really a flat tax. That's a two bracket tax. And B, you are changing the effective rates for the bottom 50%. To 0.
MichaelSLinden	684874126289420291	2016-01-06T23:08:10	aaron_hedlund A) Huge revenue loser and B) That's not what anyone thinks of when they think "flat tax."
MichaelSLinden	684873187600011264	2016-01-06T23:04:26	aaron_hedlund Right, and they're paying an average of around 15 now.
MichaelSLinden	684872945538301952	2016-01-06T23:03:29	aaron_hedlund Right. 25&lt;29.
MichaelSLinden	684870857630572544	2016-01-06T22:55:11	aaron_hedlund Also, pretty sure that would be a revenue loser.
MichaelSLinden	684870596447072256	2016-01-06T22:54:09	aaron_hedlund I don't think so. Effective rate for tippy top 1% would go down, rate for top 60-99% would go up.
MichaelSLinden	684868643721756672	2016-01-06T22:46:23	aaron_hedlund But then you've sacrificed revenue neutrality. Can't have a $40,000 standard deduction and keep revenue the same.
MichaelSLinden	684867367193722881	2016-01-06T22:41:19	aaron_hedlund I know that's your sense. But it isn't right. Middle quintile effective rate is 10.8.
MichaelSLinden	684866542593536000	2016-01-06T22:38:02	aaron_hedlund Right, but looking a the gini captures more than just the top and bottom &amp; you have a problem all throughout the distribution
MichaelSLinden	684866004397195264	2016-01-06T22:35:54	aaron_hedlund And under your flat tax construct, the post-tax gini would be higher than current after-tax gini. Thus, less progressive.
MichaelSLinden	684865670266384384	2016-01-06T22:34:34	aaron_hedlund Best way of measuring overall progressivity is by looking at the tax code's effect on the post-tax income distribution.
MichaelSLinden	684865338400440324	2016-01-06T22:33:15	aaron_hedlund BUT, I'm comparing that system to the CURRENT system. And by that measure, there is no way for flat tax to be as progressive.
MichaelSLinden	684865178530373633	2016-01-06T22:32:37	aaron_hedlund Right, so for you, any system were the bottom pays &lt; than the top is progressive. That's obviously right.
MichaelSLinden	684864869825404928	2016-01-06T22:31:23	aaron_hedlund I think we are defining "progressive" differently. You're saying a flat tax can still have lower effective rates for bottom.
MichaelSLinden	684864334799978496	2016-01-06T22:29:16	aaron_hedlund Obviously , me neither. But I think the dynamic effects are basically impossible to model accurately, so static is best.
MichaelSLinden	684863150454386688	2016-01-06T22:24:33	aaron_hedlund I'm not interested in discussing dynamic effects. I suspect you and I have completely different assumptions about that.
MichaelSLinden	684862950226706432	2016-01-06T22:23:46	aaron_hedlund Austan_Goolsbee Wrong. Fed income+payroll taxes not equal to total US tax system.
MichaelSLinden	684862603462635521	2016-01-06T22:22:23	aaron_hedlund Austan_Goolsbee Your answer has to be "no" for your contention to hold. Else the top gets a tax cut, others must pay more.
MichaelSLinden	684861759728021504	2016-01-06T22:19:02	aaron_hedlund Won't speak for Austan_Goolsbee, but I argue that US system not very progressive. Fed income tax only big progressive part.
MichaelSLinden	684860379877502977	2016-01-06T22:13:33	aaron_hedlund Austan_Goolsbee On average?
MichaelSLinden	684860300437356544	2016-01-06T22:13:14	aaron_hedlund Austan_Goolsbee Also, the EITC lowers effective tax rate for bottom quintile by only 4 points, 2.6 points for 2nd quintile.
MichaelSLinden	684859497257549825	2016-01-06T22:10:02	aaron_hedlund Austan_Goolsbee Does your mythical progressive flat tax lower effective rates on the top?
MichaelSLinden	684857074262618112	2016-01-06T22:00:25	aaron_hedlund Austan_Goolsbee 2nd quintile's rate is 5.7%. Middle's is 10.8%. No way flat tax isn't a transfer to rich from everyone else.
MichaelSLinden	684854821132890113	2016-01-06T21:51:28	aaron_hedlund Austan_Goolsbee Effective income+payroll rate for top 1% is 27.4% (per TPC)  &amp;1.4% for bottom quintile. Flat tax can't work.

MichaelSLinden	678414955713077248	2015-12-20T03:21:44	I'm gonna say this again: there is way more $$ to be raised from the top 2%, without raising income tax rates, than people realize.

MichaelSLinden	677568184497643520	2015-12-17T19:16:58	Also, very little of the money in the bill is new spending. Describing it as a "trillion dollar spending bill" implies it's new money.
MichaelSLinden	677567700764385280	2015-12-17T19:15:03	Discretionary spending (which is mostly what's in the Omni) is actually quite low, relative to history and size of the economy.
