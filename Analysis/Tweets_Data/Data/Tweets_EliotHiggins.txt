EliotHiggins	724298512670818305	2016-04-24T18:06:36	Hermius1 BagageHandeler if it was doing that then none of the witnesses would have seen it through the clouds
EliotHiggins	724297993923518464	2016-04-24T18:04:33	Hermius1 BagageHandeler If you're going to dismiss the DSB's conclusions about the Buk then I'm not interested unless you have evidence
EliotHiggins	724297747126431748	2016-04-24T18:03:34	Hermius1 BagageHandeler I'm not discounting Ukraine might be lying, but there's no evidence a jet shot down MH17
EliotHiggins	724297136729284608	2016-04-24T18:01:08	Hermius1 BagageHandeler and, frankly speaking, unless you have real evidence to disprove the DSB's evidence a Buk was used I don't care
EliotHiggins	724296606212829186	2016-04-24T17:59:02	Hermius1 BagageHandeler and no other evidence of their presence or linking them to the downing of flight mh17

EliotHiggins	724294778897240064	2016-04-24T17:51:46	Hermius1 BagageHandeler like some who claim they saw the jet firing at MH17, even though it was far past cloud level
EliotHiggins	724294660030648320	2016-04-24T17:51:18	Hermius1 BagageHandeler only witness statements, no other evidence has been presented. And the witness statements are inconsistent
EliotHiggins	724294395734925315	2016-04-24T17:50:15	I really hope the MH17 Truthers getting excited about the BBC are going to tune in. I plan to live tweet during it.
EliotHiggins	724293918993604610	2016-04-24T17:48:21	FyodorKomarov hamlet_ru I strongly advise you to watch the documentary when it's broadcast, I'm in it too
EliotHiggins	724293633919340544	2016-04-24T17:47:13	Hermius1 BagageHandeler but the SU-25 claims have been wildly inconsistent anyway 
EliotHiggins	724293330054553600	2016-04-24T17:46:01	Hermius1 BagageHandeler and did the BBC witnesses say the jets shot MH17? No, so I'm not disputing them
EliotHiggins	724293060495040521	2016-04-24T17:44:56	Hermius1 BagageHandeler I go over the radar issue in the post I sent you twice but you apparently didn't properly

EliotHiggins	724290159613714432	2016-04-24T17:33:25	Did DSB report cover 1 or more jets attacking MH17? Yup, read pages 117 on 4 various theories examined  verdict BUK
EliotHiggins	724291846525059072	2016-04-24T17:40:07	EliotHiggins BagageHandeler Yes I agree Eliot. You certainly know what youre talking about alright.
EliotHiggins	724291792787636226	2016-04-24T17:39:54	loondale boggled102 I just hope they tune in
EliotHiggins	724291014442258432	2016-04-24T17:36:49	Hermius1 BagageHandeler see, that's what people who actual know what they're talking about find out
EliotHiggins	724290206770274305	2016-04-24T17:33:36	Hermius1 BagageHandeler Donetsk, Ukraine. It's listed on the company's website
EliotHiggins	724289988268032000	2016-04-24T17:32:44	Hermius1 BagageHandeler call it up yourself to check if you're that intetested
EliotHiggins	724289797246836736	2016-04-24T17:31:58	Hermius1 BagageHandeler we did a whole piece on the truck 
EliotHiggins	724289557416558592	2016-04-24T17:31:01	Hermius1 BagageHandeler everyone who was paying attention investigated the phone number long ago
EliotHiggins	724289388721627136	2016-04-24T17:30:21	Hermius1 BagageHandeler others have, and I spoke to some of them about the call, last time anyone checked it wasn't in use
EliotHiggins	724289042410549249	2016-04-24T17:28:59	Hermius1 yes, well spotted

EliotHiggins	724288375453261828	2016-04-24T17:26:19	Hermius1 BagageHandeler then at least make some effort to comprehend the answers
EliotHiggins	724288215163801604	2016-04-24T17:25:41	Hermius1 BagageHandeler I guess by this change of subject you've run out of arguments on the "Russian lies" debate
EliotHiggins	724287936422879232	2016-04-24T17:24:35	Hermius1 BagageHandeler I don't speak the language but others have
EliotHiggins	724287740712505349	2016-04-24T17:23:48	Hermius1 BagageHandeler then why do you think anyone should take your opinions on the subject seriously?
EliotHiggins	724287488907419649	2016-04-24T17:22:48	BagageHandeler Hermius1 well thank you for sharing your feelings, but I prefer evidence
EliotHiggins	724286984630484992	2016-04-24T17:20:48	Hermius1 BagageHandeler and?
EliotHiggins	724286857811513347	2016-04-24T17:20:18	BagageHandeler Hermius1 so no actual evidence then, okay
EliotHiggins	724286477270659073	2016-04-24T17:18:47	Hermius1 BagageHandeler if I knew that it wouldn't be classified, would it?
EliotHiggins	724286343380111360	2016-04-24T17:18:15	Hermius1 BagageHandeler I explain all in great detail here, let me know where you think I went wrong 
EliotHiggins	724285670378885121	2016-04-24T17:15:35	BagageHandeler Hermius1 If you think that then can you explain how you came to that conclusion?
EliotHiggins	724285463259955200	2016-04-24T17:14:45	Hermius1 BagageHandeler the DSB was shown the classified US data and said it didn't alter their conclusions
EliotHiggins	724284500302241794	2016-04-24T17:10:56	Hermius1 BagageHandeler Again, I detail it in this post, what part do you think is wrong? 
EliotHiggins	724284243606671361	2016-04-24T17:09:54	BagageHandeler Hermius1 malinka110 they're not my images, they're Digital Globe's, you think DG is faking them too?

EliotHiggins	724283297036144644	2016-04-24T17:06:09	Hermius1 BagageHandeler malinka110 no, I'm saying they're lying
EliotHiggins	724283169403506688	2016-04-24T17:05:38	BagageHandeler Hermius1 and Russia didn't even challenge the DSB who clearly showed a total different flight path to the Russians
EliotHiggins	724283168921149440	2016-04-24T17:05:38	BagageHandeler Hermius1 malinka110 as for the Luhansk video people have visited the same spot and confirmed our work
EliotHiggins	724282123197227008	2016-04-24T17:01:29	BagageHandeler Hermius1 malinka110 and the radar lie was debunked by actual experts, so that doesn't wash
EliotHiggins	724282016745840641	2016-04-24T17:01:03	BagageHandeler Hermius1 malinka110 I think even you two could see the difference in those satellite images, its not rocket science
EliotHiggins	724281729435971584	2016-04-24T16:59:55	Hermius1 BagageHandeler malinka110 I see you're dodging looking too close at Russia's dodgy satellite imagery
EliotHiggins	724281606207340544	2016-04-24T16:59:26	Hermius1 BagageHandeler malinka110 again, I'm not claiming jets weren't there, just they didn't shoot down MH17
EliotHiggins	724280973265874944	2016-04-24T16:56:55	Hermius1 BagageHandeler Malinka110 i literally just sent you a post clearly showing how russia lied, did you read it?

EliotHiggins	724275894144122881	2016-04-24T16:36:44	Hermius1 BagageHandeler Malinka1102 or do you accept they lied about their sat imagery?
EliotHiggins	724275852867936256	2016-04-24T16:36:34	Hermius1 BagageHandeler Malinka1102 But, please, explain to me, how the Russian sat imagery had trees in it that were removed in July?
EliotHiggins	724275765332811776	2016-04-24T16:36:13	Hermius1 BagageHandeler Malinka1102 I can convincingly show those trees weren't there in July, and the Russian MoD lied

EliotHiggins	724272528840077312	2016-04-24T16:23:21	Hermius1 BagageHandeler Malinka1102 Maybe explain where these trees came from in the Russian sat imagery?

EliotHiggins	724271992153759744	2016-04-24T16:21:13	BagageHandeler Hermius1 Malinka1102 Explain to me how the Russian sat imagery from "July" has trees that were chopped down in July?

EliotHiggins	724271261531148288	2016-04-24T16:18:19	Hermius1 BagageHandeler Malinka1102 Oh, and the location of the Buk video from July 18th. Basically their entire July 21 press conference
EliotHiggins	724271162570752000	2016-04-24T16:17:56	Hermius1 BagageHandeler Malinka1102 Like when they also lied about the satellite images they presented. And MH17's flight path.
EliotHiggins	724270993376681986	2016-04-24T16:17:15	Hermius1 BagageHandeler Malinka1102 You see, what happened there was Russia was lying, and you believed it
EliotHiggins	724270941082124289	2016-04-24T16:17:03	Hermius1 BagageHandeler Malinka1102 Yeah, the Dutch Safety Board said that was debris, as did other radar experts

EliotHiggins	724270736576274434	2016-04-24T16:16:14	Hermius1 BrechtWeerheijm I trust the DSB over that anonymous document
EliotHiggins	724269863557017600	2016-04-24T16:12:46	Hermius1 So how come some eyewitnesses claim there was 1 jet, others two, some say they could see if shooting MH17 even through the clouds?
EliotHiggins	724269263704469508	2016-04-24T16:10:23	Hermius1 and especially when locals are saying people talking about the missile launcher would be in great danger from separatists
EliotHiggins	724269156464513025	2016-04-24T16:09:57	Hermius1 unlike the social media posts where people are posting as events are unfolding, not months afterwards
EliotHiggins	724269037929287680	2016-04-24T16:09:29	Hermius1 So I guess you can, in fact, get more verifiable evidence that a person on camera saying what she saw
EliotHiggins	724268906945339397	2016-04-24T16:08:58	Hermius1 Maybe you should read this first

EliotHiggins	723979439026130944	2016-04-23T20:58:43	CrimeanV Again, we use multiple sources and cross reference them, not individual pictures without additional information
EliotHiggins	723979168707391489	2016-04-23T20:57:39	CrimeanV if it was an intern sending emails claiming to contain their MH17 evidence then their communication strategy is a mess
EliotHiggins	723978743904124928	2016-04-23T20:55:58	CrimeanV The MFA and MoD have repeatedly mentioned our work in their press conferences, so I don't think its and intern sending them
EliotHiggins	723968685170372608	2016-04-23T20:15:59	CrimeanV You can read the MFAs letter yourself, I'm off for now, but feel free to come back to me 
EliotHiggins	723968014966788098	2016-04-23T20:13:20	CrimeanV Yes, the Russian Ministry of Foreign affairs has been sending me emails, seems they think I'm working talking to
EliotHiggins	723967439998976000	2016-04-23T20:11:03	CrimeanV In fact, you're wrongly criticising me for doing the exact thing the Russian government did.
EliotHiggins	723967334491271168	2016-04-23T20:10:37	CrimeanV We cross check information across multiple source, the Russian government just copy+pastes
EliotHiggins	723966731555876865	2016-04-23T20:08:14	CrimeanV If the Russian government had real evidence why did they send me plagiarised Livejournal posts instead?
EliotHiggins	723966410016337920	2016-04-23T20:06:57	CrimeanV No, it's the difference between facts and evidence, and the Russian government plagiarising Livejournals
EliotHiggins	723965838504693761	2016-04-23T20:04:41	CrimeanV Well when I asked the Russian MFA for their evidence all they had was plagiarised Livejournal posts 
EliotHiggins	723965195182321665	2016-04-23T20:02:07	CrimeanV That's just an assumption you're making without any actual evidence to support it. That's what I avoid in my work, you should too.
EliotHiggins	723964292677120000	2016-04-23T19:58:32	CrimeanV Try to find an example or withdraw your claim
EliotHiggins	723964240525180928	2016-04-23T19:58:20	CrimeanV That post has nothing to do with the type of work I do
EliotHiggins	723963996005650432	2016-04-23T19:57:21	CrimeanV As for Ukraine I could only speculate, but they have their claim about the radar and I've yet to see anyone debunk that.
EliotHiggins	723963884504268800	2016-04-23T19:56:55	CrimeanV Locals also told journalists the area was under seperatists control
EliotHiggins	723963815843516416	2016-04-23T19:56:38	CrimeanV Locals near the Almaz Antey launch sites told multiple news organisations there were no missile launches from that area
EliotHiggins	723963688869367808	2016-04-23T19:56:08	CrimeanV Also, the alternative launch sites presented by Almaz Antey were in separatists controlled areas anyway
EliotHiggins	723963589116215297	2016-04-23T19:55:44	CrimeanV The Dutch Safety Board rejected the work of Almaz Antey in Russia done outside of the investigation process
EliotHiggins	723962678289534977	2016-04-23T19:52:07	CrimeanV That's not a coherent sentence, try again.
EliotHiggins	723962435359674368	2016-04-23T19:51:09	CrimeanV so why don't you surprise me and find an example?
EliotHiggins	723962368850571264	2016-04-23T19:50:53	CrimeanV Generally I find when people have that answer they actually can't find any themselves.
EliotHiggins	723961727159775232	2016-04-23T19:48:20	CrimeanV I've been interviewed twice by the Dutch police about our work, so they certainly seem to think so.
EliotHiggins	723961584855486464	2016-04-23T19:47:47	CrimeanV Do you have examples of Jen Psaki's open source analysis?
EliotHiggins	723961401245634560	2016-04-23T19:47:03	CrimeanV For the route of the Buk if it's fake you would have to believe in a massive conspiracy based on the information we've found
EliotHiggins	723960922469965825	2016-04-23T19:45:09	CrimeanV all of which confirms the route of the Buk through separatists territory on July 17th 6/6
EliotHiggins	723960770405511168	2016-04-23T19:44:32	CrimeanV We also have multiple social media posts from long establish social media accounts reporting sightings of the buk 5/
EliotHiggins	723960647898267648	2016-04-23T19:44:03	CrimeanV we then have a AP journalist who saw the Buk and reported it before MH17 was shot down 3/
EliotHiggins	723960568156151808	2016-04-23T19:43:44	CrimeanV That geolocation was confirmed by multiple journalists who visited the locations geolocated 2/
EliotHiggins	723960493774393345	2016-04-23T19:43:26	CrimeanV So for example, with the route of the Buk we have 5 geolocated photos and images 1/
EliotHiggins	723960317085134849	2016-04-23T19:42:44	CrimeanV a range of open source information from a variety of sources, much of which cross verifies other information
EliotHiggins	723958650327437312	2016-04-23T19:36:07	CrimeanV Do you believe the expert at the S trial would have used a methodology he believed didn't work?
EliotHiggins	723957706051194880	2016-04-23T19:32:22	CrimeanV Answer my question, and them I'll happily answer yours.
EliotHiggins	723956663024279553	2016-04-23T19:28:13	CrimeanV We've written several hundred pages on this in total, but you can start here  Now answer my question.
EliotHiggins	723955605120126978	2016-04-23T19:24:01	CrimeanV Now answer my question
EliotHiggins	723955539407986688	2016-04-23T19:23:45	CrimeanV The Buk was shot down by a Buk missile launcher from Russia's 53rd air defence brigade, from south of Snizhne
EliotHiggins	723954546045759488	2016-04-23T19:19:48	CrimeanV So please answer whether or not you think the S case expert used a methodology he didn't trust in his evidence?
EliotHiggins	723954444782702598	2016-04-23T19:19:24	CrimeanV You're now asking more questions after I answered yours without you answering mine
EliotHiggins	723954347655192576	2016-04-23T19:19:01	CrimeanV I have many well documented opinions about MH17, and my interest in the S case relates to our methodology that was used in it
EliotHiggins	723952689520979968	2016-04-23T19:12:26	CrimeanV Is that clear enough for you?
EliotHiggins	723952662614577153	2016-04-23T19:12:19	CrimeanV However, since then, my own research points clearly to MH17 being shot down by a Russian supplied Buk
EliotHiggins	723952540086312961	2016-04-23T19:11:50	CrimeanV I can neither accept nor reject their initial claim due to the absence of supporting evidence
EliotHiggins	723952393210236928	2016-04-23T19:11:15	CrimeanV How can I give an answer if I don't know the information they based their conclusion on?
EliotHiggins	723951392407339010	2016-04-23T19:07:16	CrimeanV So now answer my question, do you think the expert used a methodology he thought didn't work?
EliotHiggins	723951251524825088	2016-04-23T19:06:43	CrimeanV I don't have access to the data they used so I have no way to judge that.
EliotHiggins	723951116493422592	2016-04-23T19:06:11	CrimeanV So you're saying the prosecution expert used our methodology, even though it was wrong in the Russian shelling Ukraine cases?
EliotHiggins	723950499062513664	2016-04-23T19:03:43	CrimeanV You mean the prosecution expert used a methodology he thinks didn't work?
EliotHiggins	723949641381888002	2016-04-23T19:00:19	CrimeanV And the expert used our methodology that also showed Russian fired artillery into Ukraine, so I'm glad you agree with him
EliotHiggins	723948238039076864	2016-04-23T18:54:44	CrimeanV Yes, I've said that repeatedly, I guess I really do have to dumb it down for you. Now your turn.
EliotHiggins	723947612018216960	2016-04-23T18:52:15	CrimeanV I already answered, I obviously accept it as it uses the same methodology we developed, now your turn
EliotHiggins	723946867483140097	2016-04-23T18:49:18	CrimeanV hahaha, you still can't answer can you?
EliotHiggins	723945899102224384	2016-04-23T18:45:27	CrimeanV So where is your answer? Still going to continue your dance?
EliotHiggins	723945821834719233	2016-04-23T18:45:08	CrimeanV I think it would be pretty obvious I support conclusions that use exactly the same methodology we created in the first place
EliotHiggins	723944975336116224	2016-04-23T18:41:47	CrimeanV So let's see your answer. C'mon, you can do it, give me that straight answer, I know you've got it in you.
EliotHiggins	723944887113113605	2016-04-23T18:41:25	CrimeanV Although if you really can't figure out the answer yourself here's a small clue from my website 
EliotHiggins	723944722755145728	2016-04-23T18:40:46	CrimeanV It's only manners that the person asked the question first answers the question first, rather than continue with their dance
EliotHiggins	723943118421266433	2016-04-23T18:34:24	CrimeanV Malinka1102 and keep in mind its the same methodology we developed, as acknowledged in court
EliotHiggins	723942985931587584	2016-04-23T18:33:52	CrimeanV I've spent long enough waiting for a straight answer for you to give me one first
EliotHiggins	723942857472651264	2016-04-23T18:33:22	CrimeanV You answer first
EliotHiggins	723942129534423041	2016-04-23T18:30:28	CrimeanV Malinka1102 So no answer to a simple question, no wonder you love Putin so much

EliotHiggins	723940999144284160	2016-04-23T18:25:59	CrimeanV Malinka1102 Why don't it a go and find out? Does the thought of my reply scare you that much?
EliotHiggins	723940527507410944	2016-04-23T18:24:06	CrimeanV How about you tell me question you think I've asked you? It might clear up this confusion
EliotHiggins	723940291808473089	2016-04-23T18:23:10	CrimeanV You seem to be answering a question you imagined I asked but did not. Please reread my question carefully
EliotHiggins	723940080059076608	2016-04-23T18:22:19	CrimeanV If you can't answer a straight question with a straight answer how can I take you seriously?
EliotHiggins	723939754698522624	2016-04-23T18:21:02	CrimeanV What is your personal opinion on the crater analysis methodology used by the prosecution expert? Easy question, give it a go.
EliotHiggins	723939411021467648	2016-04-23T18:19:40	CrimeanV I'm asking for an essay on the comparative merit of Russian and Western legal systems, its a very simple question
EliotHiggins	723939016920444928	2016-04-23T18:18:06	CrimeanV that's nice, but I fail to see how that's relevant to your personal opinion of the methodology used.
EliotHiggins	723938236716998656	2016-04-23T18:15:00	CrimeanV Sure, if you actually answer the question instead of dancing around it

EliotHiggins	723937641280987138	2016-04-23T18:12:38	CrimeanV all this dancing around the question is revealing in itself
EliotHiggins	723937483814215680	2016-04-23T18:12:00	CrimeanV maybe we can discuss that if you manage to answer my first very simple question
EliotHiggins	723937221175291904	2016-04-23T18:10:58	CrimeanV surely your opinion of the validity a methodology should be independent of your political opinions?

EliotHiggins	723936609066975232	2016-04-23T18:08:32	CrimeanV why does a simple question, which you say doesn't matter, seem impossible for you to answer?
EliotHiggins	723936362223816705	2016-04-23T18:07:33	CrimeanV how about you just answer either "I accept" or "I don't accept"
EliotHiggins	723936075673157633	2016-04-23T18:06:25	CrimeanV Your refusal to answer the question makes me think your thoughts on the matter are something you want to hide
EliotHiggins	723935834093838338	2016-04-23T18:05:27	CrimeanV If it doesn't matter why are you so desperate to avoid answering the question?
EliotHiggins	723935036278509568	2016-04-23T18:02:17	CrimeanV I have to admit, I do enjoy you dancing around the question
EliotHiggins	723934316603015168	2016-04-23T17:59:25	CrimeanV I fail to see how that question is so difficult for you to understand
EliotHiggins	723934106778787840	2016-04-23T17:58:35	CrimeanV I'm not asking you about anything else, just your opinion of that particular methodology used by the prosecution witness
EliotHiggins	723933903988334592	2016-04-23T17:57:47	CrimeanV you seem to misunderstand, I'm simply asking your opinion of the methodology used by the prosecution expert
EliotHiggins	723933096425447424	2016-04-23T17:54:34	CrimeanV again you avoid the question, I want your opinion of that specific evidence, its a very narrow question
EliotHiggins	723932678274310144	2016-04-23T17:52:55	CrimeanV Do you want me to explain it more slowly?

EliotHiggins	723932207463731201	2016-04-23T17:51:02	CrimeanV I'm not sure how much clearer I can be, you can answer yes or no if it makes it easier for you
EliotHiggins	723932028786380801	2016-04-23T17:50:20	CrimeanV again, I'm not asking about her guilt, I'm asking your opinion of the crater analysis methodology used by the prosecution.
EliotHiggins	723931044760719360	2016-04-23T17:46:25	CrimeanV i guess the answer is that you can't answer the question. Hmm, I wonder why.
EliotHiggins	723930847930363904	2016-04-23T17:45:38	CrimeanV no, you dodge the question, I want to now if YOU accept the methodology used by the prosecution for crater analysis
EliotHiggins	723930592144961537	2016-04-23T17:44:37	CrimeanV you answer my question first, we started on our crater analysis technique, so lets stick to the subject
EliotHiggins	723930057316675584	2016-04-23T17:42:30	CrimeanV I think it matters very much. Why do you refuse to answer?
EliotHiggins	723929106019172352	2016-04-23T17:38:43	CrimeanV doesn't matter to whether or not you accept the methodology used by the prosecution expert, can you answer that question?
EliotHiggins	723928678107910145	2016-04-23T17:37:01	CrimeanV it was called the Bellingcat method by the prosecution expert at the trial, do you or do you not accept the methodology?
EliotHiggins	723927454230917121	2016-04-23T17:32:09	CrimeanV Why do you keep dodging the question as whether or not you accept the methodology?
EliotHiggins	723925556581011456	2016-04-23T17:24:37	CrimeanV so do you or do you not accept the methodology used by the prosecution to help secure Savchenko's conviction?
EliotHiggins	723925387810627584	2016-04-23T17:23:56	CrimeanV the prosecution witness called it the Bellingcat method, so in this case we do not only know, but we also invented it
EliotHiggins	723924522483769346	2016-04-23T17:20:30	CrimeanV well I know the methodology you just claimed was bullshit was used to convict her, so do you accept the methodology or not?
EliotHiggins	723924329780662272	2016-04-23T17:19:44	CrimeanV is there any individuals details you'd like to debunk or is that pithy little statement all you have?
