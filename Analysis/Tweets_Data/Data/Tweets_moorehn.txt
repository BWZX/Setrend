moorehn	725794907051401217	2016-04-28T21:12:45	film_girl oh wait I was still on the bros. THAT theory. With THIS tweet I was just pandering to my artisanal readers.
moorehn	725794596291272704	2016-04-28T21:11:31	Right! Bros have to be balanced out with other perspectives, otherwise you dig a deeper hole in news judgment 
moorehn	725794407899889665	2016-04-28T21:10:46	film_girl nytimesbusiness I think you were the first person I ever raised this theory to
moorehn	725793691080740864	2016-04-28T21:07:55	And yes, notallbros. But man, the bad ones do a LOT of damage, yo.
moorehn	725793547509727232	2016-04-28T21:07:20	So it's not like you shouldn't have any bros! Bros are ppl too. But the bro/non-bro balance is way out of whack. Consider balancing it out.
moorehn	725793346271232000	2016-04-28T21:06:32	jaspar It appears (according to the allegations, which I am not at all commenting on in any way) that he favored bros
moorehn	725793186757615617	2016-04-28T21:05:54	Plus, bros usually overconfiden, think they know everything. Hubris is a key bro trait. So that shuts down discussion/increases brosplaining
moorehn	725792683986407425	2016-04-28T21:03:55	Anyway that is why bros are a problem. Bro-ness is about not looking around/not perceiving other people. Which is death to journalism.
moorehn	725792460350300160	2016-04-28T21:03:01	And lastly, bros tend to promote other bros almost exclusively. Because bros are used to traveling in packs of bros. So you get less flavor.
moorehn	725792281245171714	2016-04-28T21:02:19	Thirdly, bros usually live and work in bro-friendly worlds, which kills their sense of imagination for stories beyond bro-dom.
moorehn	725791889140625409	2016-04-28T21:00:45	Because they are bros, and being woke, for them, is an enormous uphill battle. Nothing has ever been denied the bro. He's so comfy!
moorehn	725791761512144896	2016-04-28T21:00:15	I mean, I'm not random about bros. It's a real problem. The main thing about bros is that they have 0 understanding of other demographics.
moorehn	725791097637736450	2016-04-28T20:57:36	Yikes. I don't know about content of NYT suit. But Heidi's right about the bro. (Sorry, bros, not all bros, I know.)

moorehn	725013141361426432	2016-04-26T17:26:17	richlauwers it’s a public service! Hw many other people has cohensoptical lied to or scammed?
moorehn	725011945028501505	2016-04-26T17:21:32	They shouldn’t be messing with *anybody*. Consumer abuse like this is shameful.

moorehn	725010701723549697	2016-04-26T17:16:35	I just went down the street to another store, and they say the SAME designer frames are $202. cohensoptical that’s just awful.
moorehn	725010504289230849	2016-04-26T17:15:48	WAIT it gets better. cohensoptical said the frames for the glasses cost $490, and insurance would take $120 off.
moorehn	725006587782418433	2016-04-26T17:00:15	susanmcp1 it’s the truest negotiating principle. Always walk away from a liar.
moorehn	725006398132748289	2016-04-26T16:59:29	BleuZ00m CohensOptical as a matter of consumer safety and rights, it’s important to spread the word of businesses that tell falsehoods.
moorehn	725006132863983618	2016-04-26T16:58:26	Also: never do business with anyone that shows any evidence of dishonesty. As they say on Wall St, there’s never just one cockroach.
moorehn	725005580704821252	2016-04-26T16:56:15	Also beyond shameful for cohensoptical on 51st and 3rd to discourage customers from using insurance. Feels scammy and dishonest.
moorehn	725004996165689344	2016-04-26T16:53:55	Good reason to 1) know your rights and 2)have the facts. And never will I do business with cohensoptical again. For shame.
moorehn	725004744826183680	2016-04-26T16:52:55	I think we can agree, cohensoptical, that the difference between $300 and a $55 copay is signifcant. And your staff lies to customers.
moorehn	725004420371636224	2016-04-26T16:51:38	The cohensoptical store said yes, insurance didn’t cover my lenses. “$300 please.” I called insurance. They said lenses would be $55 copay
moorehn	725003968607297536	2016-04-26T16:49:50	Wow, just dealing with a cohensoptical store on 51st and 3rd Ave. Asked how much lenses would with insurance, they said $300. I said “rly?”
moorehn	725002240239517697	2016-04-26T16:42:58	noahchestnut gabestein also Snapchat doesn’t have the global reach/time spent that Facebook has, so it’s a harder sell for ads IMO
moorehn	725001833027129344	2016-04-26T16:41:21	noahchestnut gabestein Snapchat keeps its data very tight so it’s not helpful to publishers
moorehn	725001580852973569	2016-04-26T16:40:21	noahchestnut gabestein also FB unlikely to ever consider another social network competition
moorehn	724998116957650944	2016-04-26T16:26:35	noahchestnut gabestein ie, if an article is an instant article on the FB platform, it becomes easier for them to monetize (not yet tho)
moorehn	724997831430410240	2016-04-26T16:25:27	noahchestnut gabestein sorry, just catching up! Would question assumptions. FB just needs volume of content on its own platform
moorehn	724987022679638016	2016-04-26T15:42:30	Pretty compelling math from moorehn on why digital pubs are getting suckered by "native" or "social" strategies. 
moorehn	724997278432415745	2016-04-26T16:23:15	JamieStelter truth
moorehn	724972735559024640	2016-04-26T14:45:44	WaPo's jrezaian becomes a Nieman fellow. Excellent. 
moorehn	724981589407633414	2016-04-26T15:20:55	gabestein ie maybe the basic problem is that publishers are trying to sell things they don’t own (FB+GOOG own traffic and social)
moorehn	724981130953428992	2016-04-26T15:19:05	gabestein thank you! And yea if FB controls both traffic+social impressions, feels like publishers getting crowded out of things to sell
moorehn	724980774517260289	2016-04-26T15:17:40	But as moorehn says, is there any reason an advertiser would come to you for those impressions when it can buy cheaper, direct from FB?
moorehn	724980035459784704	2016-04-26T15:14:44	Thinking out-loud here: the ~30M "cap" on FB traffic is uniques to the site, not social impressions. So maybe you could monetize those?
moorehn	724980767344975873	2016-04-26T15:17:39	tomfgoodwin charlesarthur that doesn’t work, though, or else BuzzFeed wouldn’t have fallen $80m short
moorehn	724979677056610305	2016-04-26T15:13:19	"This branded content plan with digital publishing is a minefield of magical thinking." Smart, from moorehn 
moorehn	724974635624849409	2016-04-26T14:53:17	charlesarthur the cap on traffic was a gamechanger for me (thanks gabestein!). Revealed illusion we buy into while scrapping for pennies

moorehn	724961078724157441	2016-04-26T13:59:24	In moorehn's excellent points, I think most important is we passed on knowing what's going on w/our own sites. We sold that process, poorly

moorehn	724953503915974656	2016-04-26T13:29:18	Morning tweets from moorehn on profitability of branded content &amp; news's lack of metrics access is required reading 
moorehn	724953086352064514	2016-04-26T13:27:39	RyanHatoum already tried, and the result was that BuzzFeed missed revenue projections by 80%.
moorehn	724952880977973248	2016-04-26T13:26:50	jasongay you have the special powers to do it. Ordinary mortals shouldn’t try
moorehn	724950536785657858	2016-04-26T13:17:31	Related content: jeffjarvis on publishers needing to control data  and gabestein on FB 
moorehn	724949669948837888	2016-04-26T13:14:04	Anyway that’s the branded content business-model ourobouros. It will consume itself, but not before consuming newsroom budgets first.
moorehn	724949161158778880	2016-04-26T13:12:03	Exactly! And 1) publishers are PAYING FB for that traffic to branded content 2) FB algorithm keeps traffic modest 
moorehn	724948536647897089	2016-04-26T13:09:34	Yes, noted in previous tweets but ran out of characters here :) 
moorehn	724948385397104640	2016-04-26T13:08:58	wfederman by killing us first
moorehn	724948125182484480	2016-04-26T13:07:56	moorehn Ya ... when I launched a business I couldn't believe how cost effective FB was. Print or other digital didn't get look in
moorehn	724948265645527041	2016-04-26T13:08:30	You can’t make the math work. You don’t even have access to the math, because ad exchanges own your impressions info! It’s time to get real.
moorehn	724947740707409920	2016-04-26T13:06:24	And: 85 cents of every ad dollar is going FB and GOOG. So every digital publisher is fighting over 15 cents (with expensive branded content)
moorehn	724947392852856832	2016-04-26T13:05:01	In short, on a mass ad scale, only price matters. You can’t out-clever it, you can’t out-prestige it, you can’t make fetch happen.
moorehn	724946615698608129	2016-04-26T13:01:56	Point: if you’re going to get into a hella expensive biz, wise to make sure you can win. Digital pubs can’t in branded content. It’s 💸💸💸
moorehn	724946188408098816	2016-04-26T13:00:14	It applies to digital pubs’ branded content, which badly competes with 1) with more sophisticated ad agencies and 2) lower FB, GOOG pricing
moorehn	724945838255050753	2016-04-26T12:58:51	Addendum to previous: this does not apply to news video, which is unique and powerful and part of a balanced journalism diet.

moorehn	724944105206374401	2016-04-26T12:51:58	Allycrighton that’s the illusion publishers have been offering, but it falls flat. 1) FB and GOOG have credibility 2) media cred is low
moorehn	724942948580864001	2016-04-26T12:47:22	Allycrighton if it stayed text/photo, yes, but the prevailing model is video. And that’s going to be a whopper to bottom lines
moorehn	724942010508005376	2016-04-26T12:43:38	Anyway, good luck with that. No business succeeds in profiting by choosing the high-overhead model but maybe you’ll be first 🙄
moorehn	724941698162413570	2016-04-26T12:42:24	The math just doesn’t work. What’s the value add? You could argue the “brand” of digital publishers, but ads are sold on price.
moorehn	724941448127336448	2016-04-26T12:41:24	And 2) promising outcomes you can’t control, because Facebook and Google control your traffic AND are your rivals for ad dollars
moorehn	724941249644531714	2016-04-26T12:40:37	So to get profitable, you’re staking a lot of money on 1) a business that is, by its nature, hard on profit margins with high overhead.
moorehn	724940955569246211	2016-04-26T12:39:27	And 2) branded content is hella expensive. ONE good video shoot costs as much as the yearly salary of a  young digital writer.
moorehn	724940773981065216	2016-04-26T12:38:43	Trying to get around this w/ branded content won’t work because 1) it’s time-consuming and 2 campaigns a month won’t bring in enough revenue
moorehn	724940574529302528	2016-04-26T12:37:56	And 2) why would any advertiser pay a premium to a digital publisher when FB and Google have the data and can undercut all pricing?
moorehn	724940410200674305	2016-04-26T12:37:17	So publishers have to explain (and are doing so very badly) 1) why would advertisers use you instead of going straight to FB and Google?
moorehn	724940205443018752	2016-04-26T12:36:28	But 2 major flaws: 1) publishers don’t control traffic to their sites. Facebook and Google do that 2) FB and Google sell ads on that traffic
moorehn	724939880921485312	2016-04-26T12:35:11	This branded content plan with digital publishing is a minefield of magical thinking. The model is that publishers promise traffic for ads

moorehn	724936979561992192	2016-04-26T12:23:39	That’s a problem because publishers don’t know their own audience info for advertisers. So pubs get disintermediated 
moorehn	724936753874919425	2016-04-26T12:22:45	The key problem with journalism is that it doesn’t own its data. It relies on outside services which are inaccurate

moorehn	720040200047566848	2016-04-13T00:05:36	"Donald Trump is the father-in-law of the Observer's publisher. That is not a reason to endorse him." Well, nor is there any other reason.
moorehn	720031744871768065	2016-04-12T23:32:00	Donald Trump has been endorsed by his newspaper-in-law  
moorehn	720019317279088640	2016-04-12T22:42:37	Even Buzzfeed feeling chill winds 
moorehn	719956122724147200	2016-04-12T18:31:30	AP really lays into WaPo over Trump donation story:  
moorehn	719993940104101892	2016-04-12T21:01:46	In July, NY Observer editor said they wouldn’t opine on Trump:  Today, an endorsement: 
moorehn	719995140048318464	2016-04-12T21:06:32	NY Observer of old obsessively chronicled the “power elite." Now the paper rails against the “media and cultural elite," the “cognoscenti.”
moorehn	720020534453485568	2016-04-12T22:47:27	raju anyone would! But this is proof of how projections are magical thinking in this business IMO.
moorehn	720019168087683072	2016-04-12T22:42:01	It is, though newsroom can’t be painted with same brush. Just embarrassing by association. 
moorehn	720018878731001856	2016-04-12T22:40:52	raju but they are not DOING 50% more revenue. They EXPECT to do 50% more rev. Given THIS miss, hard to trust that projection.
moorehn	720018565122887682	2016-04-12T22:39:37	tomgara raju and I hope you know this is the *opposite* of shade. BuzzFeed is better at this than anyone. That’s why it matters.
moorehn	720018418448142336	2016-04-12T22:39:02	tomgara raju those numbers looked a bit dodgy as I remember, when they were leaked. Best not to trust them.
moorehn	720018290437984256	2016-04-12T22:38:32	raju i.e. The business you build on $250m of revenue —hires, expansion — is VERY different than the one on $170m of revenue
moorehn	720018079200186368	2016-04-12T22:37:42	raju and your argument is about raw revenue growth — which is nice, but still $80 million less than expected, so not useful to them.
moorehn	720017804964065281	2016-04-12T22:36:36	raju no, the argument I was making was that they have strong abilities, and so if they can’t make their targets, no one can.
moorehn	720017432430190592	2016-04-12T22:35:07	This reads like satire. 
moorehn	720015655676854273	2016-04-12T22:28:04	raju given they missed THIS projection by ~40%, perhaps best not to trust the next projection?

moorehn	720014502016757761	2016-04-12T22:23:29	raju right, how is that 50% revenue growth?
moorehn	720014392423800832	2016-04-12T22:23:03	This is truly impressive as a pile of 💩

moorehn	719943953026531329	2016-04-12T17:43:08	Sure, BuzzFeed missed a revenue target. But this is a beautiful paragraph.

moorehn	720009844099571716	2016-04-12T22:04:58	raju BuzzFeed but missing targets by $80 million is real money, in any universe. 50% growth, in that world, won’t pay the bills
moorehn	720004252676923392	2016-04-12T21:42:45	Amen. We need more business models that support high quality journalism.

moorehn	714630242493718528	2016-03-29T01:48:21	The really cheap part about those Obama comments is that his admin has jailed sources for speaking to journos for “deep reporting.”
