mattlynley	694288819026132992	2016-02-01T22:38:48	Alrighty! All donezo. Interesting call!
mattlynley	694287489696034816	2016-02-01T22:33:31	So, taking all bets: which segments were underperformers?
mattlynley	694287285227917312	2016-02-01T22:32:42	So, in short, it seems some appear to be performing better than others, and that means there are tough calls to make, per Porat.
