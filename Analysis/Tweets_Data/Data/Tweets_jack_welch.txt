jack_welch	699992531778535426	2016-02-17T16:23:19	For your next presentation, here are three pieces of advice that might really help. 
jack_welch	698717158902202369	2016-02-14T03:55:26	Cruz and Rubio 
jack_welch	698664390380404738	2016-02-14T00:25:45	Sad death of a  great jurist....Now we'll see what having Republican majority in both houses really means
jack_welch	698525057916731392	2016-02-13T15:12:06	Great morning walk with Suzy and Happy. Feeling for our friends and family up north. cold 
jack_welch	697247900695449600	2016-02-10T02:37:08	Hilary's concession speech? Desperate, pandering and just plain panicked.
jack_welch	697239337889562624	2016-02-10T02:03:06	Context: Ted Cruz spent $800k on NH airwaves. Jeb Bush's team spent $35 million.
jack_welch	697244131073134592	2016-02-10T02:22:09	Aside from the people in that room who are on the payroll, does anyone still believe anything HillaryClinton says? NHPrimary
jack_welch	697246827251396614	2016-02-10T02:32:52	For BernieSanders, it's basically just one riff. But it's crystal clear. NHPrimary

jack_welch	697245565860581376	2016-02-10T02:27:51	"Human rights across the board for every single American!"~~ Hillary Clinton 
jack_welch	697209663427866628	2016-02-10T00:05:11	32 percent of Ds in NH said honesty was most important trait in pres--and they went 93-5 for Sanders. NINETY-THREE to FIVE.
jack_welch	697244592295571456	2016-02-10T02:23:59	Hillary concession speech showing why she lost: lots of wonky buzz words...very little blood, sweat &amp; tears. 
jack_welch	697245219402747904	2016-02-10T02:26:29	For sure 
jack_welch	697245131754336257	2016-02-10T02:26:08	That Clinton screeching has to go
jack_welch	697244127092723712	2016-02-10T02:22:08	Amen..You lost ..goodnight

jack_welch	696158910814801920	2016-02-07T02:29:53	D's get MSNBC where moderator hugs debaters..R's get Raddatz..angry liberal...Reince must go fast
jack_welch	696155421007089664	2016-02-07T02:16:00	This debate confirms Reince Priebus is a complete disaster .How many elections must R's lose before this Man is removed.
jack_welch	696152123906523136	2016-02-07T02:02:54	abc why don't you send MarthaRaddatz to msnbc ? 
jack_welch	696149707358281730	2016-02-07T01:53:18	jack_welch Can you imagine the DNC allowing a debate on Fox?
jack_welch	696149473555300352	2016-02-07T01:52:22	Why would R's ever let wildly liberal Raddatz be part of R debate.Don't they watch Sun. if ABC insists on her...dump them
jack_welch	696144735526903809	2016-02-07T01:33:33	Do you agree with marcorubio? GOPDebate 
jack_welch	696144292465795072	2016-02-07T01:31:47	Very very good approach from Christie on Rubio's lack of experience.
