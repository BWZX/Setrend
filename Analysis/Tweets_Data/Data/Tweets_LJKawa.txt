LJKawa	721895810372407296	2016-04-18T02:59:08	stephen_tapp I mean the Jan 2015 cut.
LJKawa	721895440287952896	2016-04-18T02:57:39	(This is also a small argument in favor for CBs not communicating clearly with mkts except in emerg setting to ensure accommodative stance)
LJKawa	721895224352620544	2016-04-18T02:56:48	...He had already got more easing than he bargained for, for free, then counteracted that. Doubt it really mattered much in end, but still.
LJKawa	721895084711677952	2016-04-18T02:56:15	One Poloz tactical error, imo, was basically telling mkt their belief he'd keep easing was wrong after the Jan cut

LJKawa	721876936146952192	2016-04-18T01:44:08	Exactly. As Geddy Lee said, "If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice." 
LJKawa	721866742738370560	2016-04-18T01:03:37	MacRoweNick teasri stephenfgordon why I asked Poloz "are you targeting an overshoot?" Bc that's easiest way to square the circle imho

LJKawa	721844259415007232	2016-04-17T23:34:17	stephenfgordon So far, I'm on the cavalier's side. Tho it is perfectly possible to make sensible defences of fiscal deficits.

LJKawa	721728054247231488	2016-04-17T15:52:31	Kobe Bryant's take:  
LJKawa	721727560703426562	2016-04-17T15:50:34	Food for * thought:  Canada is embarking upon a *national* spending program at a time when econ slack issues are largely *regional*
LJKawa	721726514916536320	2016-04-17T15:46:24	That is, with a sizable 'reserve army of unemployed' fiscal policy wouldn't crowd out private activity at all, leading to maximum multiplier
LJKawa	721725650176839680	2016-04-17T15:42:58	I do find plausible the SPoloz argument about fiscal policy being more effective than MonPol at this point and circumstance. So far so good.
LJKawa	721724960088035328	2016-04-17T15:40:14	Excuse me for possibly being cavalier, but I'm not convinced of this Poloz conjecture.....

LJKawa	721713338812604416	2016-04-17T14:54:03	Yermack on regualtions: this technology was designed to bypass regulations entirely, so….
LJKawa	721712454317838336	2016-04-17T14:50:32	Cooper: One of the interesting things about Canada/England—these guys are well ahead of the curve in terms of regulations [for fintech]
LJKawa	721712032815456256	2016-04-17T14:48:52	Wilkins: One of the big issues that have come up in discussions is how do regulations apply--Are we regulating the activity or the entity?

LJKawa	721706489073819648	2016-04-17T14:26:50	Yermack: things like the NYSE may not exist in 10 years because they may not be needed

LJKawa	721432271190945792	2016-04-16T20:17:11	Lipton: the idea of finding a way to triage--separate cos that really can't continue &amp; improve governance while reducing debt = right things
LJKawa	721432097928425472	2016-04-16T20:16:30	Lipton: banks as shareholders...is done in some countries, but Chinese banks aren't accustomed to that, conflict of interest concerns too
LJKawa	721431975547039744	2016-04-16T20:16:01	Lipton: but in case where cos do have future prospects, debt-equity swaps will also help solve governance problems
LJKawa	721431832852606976	2016-04-16T20:15:27	Lipton: debt-equity swaps don't save companies w no future prospects (PREACH!)
LJKawa	721431743534866433	2016-04-16T20:15:05	Lipton: cos w so much debt + banks as creditors = solutions need to address both sides.
LJKawa	721431604732764160	2016-04-16T20:14:32	Huang: new idea of debt-equity swap can work as bandaid (paraphrasing, also not a new idea)
LJKawa	721431227035742209	2016-04-16T20:13:02	I preferred Spocking 
LJKawa	721431046705848320	2016-04-16T20:12:19	Lipton: agree that China can grow out of problem, but concern that policy decisions need to support rebalancing not rebuild vulnerabilities
LJKawa	721430712075874304	2016-04-16T20:10:59	Lipton: enterprises that are unprofitable need 2 be smaller not larger, savings need to decrease thru rebalancing, more mkt-based fin system
LJKawa	721430436778483712	2016-04-16T20:09:54	Lipton: if efforts are made to keep growth going by keeping credit going to [zombie cos], this could become an unmanageable problem.
LJKawa	721430234315276288	2016-04-16T20:09:06	Lipton: China's debt worries analysts and foreign investors...we see it as a subject that requires attention, not something that = crisis rn
LJKawa	721429948876132352	2016-04-16T20:07:57	Huang: size of NPLs compared to 90s is much smaller. Size of SOEs is much much smaller. China can utilize hhd savings &amp; grow out of problem.
LJKawa	721429315699765254	2016-04-16T20:05:27	Huang: bank loans to SOEs pretty much the only issue, espec in sectors where there's overcapacity
LJKawa	721429046815498240	2016-04-16T20:04:22	Huang: cen't gov't debt/GDP fairly low (key phrase: cen't gov't)
LJKawa	721428940296962048	2016-04-16T20:03:57	Huang: corp sector--need to distinguish between SOEs and others. Private sector deleveraging quite effectively, not too worried about them.
LJKawa	721428825561829378	2016-04-16T20:03:30	Huang: China's hhd balance sheet is very strong. Other economies are jealous of that.
LJKawa	721428140913008640	2016-04-16T20:00:46	Fu: real challenging part is how we are going to retrain folks for new jobs after capacity reduction
LJKawa	721427782534828032	2016-04-16T19:59:21	Basically, too many darn stakeholders to make happy.
LJKawa	721427717657403393	2016-04-16T19:59:06	Fu describing China's unique corporate governance challenges in a way that is making my head spin
LJKawa	721426842511663104	2016-04-16T19:55:37	Lipton: needs to be some directed downsizing in key sectors, espec where there are political sensitivities around dealing with unemployed
LJKawa	721426687553105921	2016-04-16T19:55:00	Lipton: in China, there's not yet kind of decentralized corp governance that makes sure unprofitable cos begin to exit.
LJKawa	721426554010603521	2016-04-16T19:54:28	Lipton: not clear there's the right kind of governance in corporate sector that will result in the right outcome
LJKawa	721426474356645888	2016-04-16T19:54:09	...you have resources being channeled towards potentially unproductive investments
LJKawa	721426316030033925	2016-04-16T19:53:31	Lipton: China has v high savings; when you have that much savings flowing into banking system/retained earnings...
LJKawa	721426116628627457	2016-04-16T19:52:44	Lipton: but they'll need to manu hhd goods, not for heavy industry/exports
LJKawa	721426024404238340	2016-04-16T19:52:22	Lipton: If the process of transition is successful and hhd income grows, there will still be a manufacturing need.
LJKawa	721425839590649856	2016-04-16T19:51:38	Lipton: you can see from this discussion how hard it is to gauge what's going on...
LJKawa	721425703565193220	2016-04-16T19:51:05	(I am not sure this argument is a great one, but yeah, can't do reforms on this front too fast)
LJKawa	721425597587697665	2016-04-16T19:50:40	Fu: some of these cos don't make $, but they still send $ to gov't.
LJKawa	721425530931802112	2016-04-16T19:50:24	Fu: we can't decapacity all at once, it'll cause trouble, not just employment issues, also gov't rev issues.
LJKawa	721425130279342081	2016-04-16T19:48:49	Fu: actual imports for comm goods has actually grown very fast...so it's not just Spring festival, but real recovery.
LJKawa	721424642364350464	2016-04-16T19:46:52	Huang: rebound/recovery in comm prices means demand is stabilizing; that's encouraging--[fears of] global deflation easing somewhat
LJKawa	721424491138695169	2016-04-16T19:46:16	Huang: Jan/Feb period is very hard to understand Chinese data (oh really, eh?). March data to me, is more encouraging.
LJKawa	721424200293085190	2016-04-16T19:45:07	Fu: employment is very stable, very strong
LJKawa	721424140578779136	2016-04-16T19:44:53	Fu: we see very good indication of progress in transition away from investment-led growth; which is very positive.
LJKawa	721423815876730881	2016-04-16T19:43:35	Fu: industry, espec manufacturing, seems a lot better as of Q1; not very confident about whether it will continue to be this way.
LJKawa	721423272349429760	2016-04-16T19:41:26	Huang: Fed's decisions are important variable for EMs, decision to postpone was "wise"
LJKawa	721423142078541824	2016-04-16T19:40:55	Huang has said "encouraging" a dozen times in 90 seconds.
LJKawa	721422821604388865	2016-04-16T19:39:38	Huang: Jan/Feb market situation were very worrisome to everyone; China's Q1 data encouraging, IMF upward revision encouraging
LJKawa	721422518121336832	2016-04-16T19:38:26	Lipton: China must be careful not to be propping up parts of the economy with excess capacity
LJKawa	721422169331363840	2016-04-16T19:37:03	Lipton: ongoing strength, rebalancing, policy buffers/levers = no sharp Chinese growth slowdown soon (probably)
LJKawa	721421831857692672	2016-04-16T19:35:42	Lipton: Chinese fiscal stimulus prompted our upgrade to its growth forecast
LJKawa	721421703323197441	2016-04-16T19:35:12	Lipton: China shouldn't be trying to maintain the fastest possible growth, but fastest sustainable growth
LJKawa	721421538357067776	2016-04-16T19:34:32	Lipton: global recovery is weak and gauging it with precision is very difficult

LJKawa	720302765411581953	2016-04-13T17:28:56	It's funny how no one has ever produced a direct quote of Poloz talking down the loonie.

LJKawa	720293114225758209	2016-04-13T16:50:35	kevinmilligan I adapt my position in recognition of that. Beyond this don't think our thoughts are mutually exclusive...
LJKawa	720290596028428289	2016-04-13T16:40:35	kevinmilligan At least one's (probably) been willing to go through with that route since Coyne Affair though...

LJKawa	720288208156798977	2016-04-13T16:31:05	True! But how much did it change FinMin potential/ability to set monpol? I would argue not in game-changing way 
LJKawa	720286016356151296	2016-04-13T16:22:23	By convention, BoC is independent. But potential for CB non-independence is literally enshrined in law.

LJKawa	720282272306307072	2016-04-13T16:07:30	Real answer:  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
LJKawa	720282098167390208	2016-04-13T16:06:49	Awful question.

LJKawa	720279920979615746	2016-04-13T15:58:09	I really feel for a monetary policymaker who's been forced to discuss fiscal policy, multipliers, and forecasting at length.
LJKawa	720279506225770496	2016-04-13T15:56:31	(I write that because this claim is demonstrably false) 
LJKawa	720278945711702016	2016-04-13T15:54:17	Poloz: "This is not a forecasting contest"  Well, technically, since monpol works with lags, it kinda should be?

LJKawa	720276063415361536	2016-04-13T15:42:50	Leslie_Preston acoyne Agreed. But still something to be concerned about!
LJKawa	720275990317043713	2016-04-13T15:42:32	From the BoC's analytical paper:    Do these look like the Budget 2016 multipliers to you? 
LJKawa	720275287074848768	2016-04-13T15:39:45	Question in French. Sounds very passionate.
LJKawa	720274866306359296	2016-04-13T15:38:04	I think acoyne jumped the gun in 2014 but if you're not concerned about CB independence right now in Canada, you definitely should be.
LJKawa	720274218210820096	2016-04-13T15:35:30	I will tell you I have already received information suggesting that the BoC's and Finance's estimates of multipliers differ materially.

LJKawa	720273541418115072	2016-04-13T15:32:48	This is obfuscation to the nth degree.
LJKawa	720273347309936640	2016-04-13T15:32:02	Poloz: any numbers that we would come up with are the same as Finance's so we're not going to quibble about it
LJKawa	720273148134817792	2016-04-13T15:31:15	Poloz: I'm not going to tell you how much I think gov't spending will add to growth. Seriously. He said this. (paraphrasing)
LJKawa	720273046037204993	2016-04-13T15:30:50	.curryb killing it there: Why are you choosing to use Finance's estimates? PBO is short-staffed and made their own estimates.

LJKawa	720270460303339520	2016-04-13T15:20:34	POLOZ: I know this sounds strange, but actually... 
LJKawa	720270266345988096	2016-04-13T15:19:48	POLOZ: most of the increase [in CADUSD] appears to be due to shifts in expectations about monetary policy in both the US and Canada
LJKawa	720269851151986688	2016-04-13T15:18:09	POLOZ: Canadian [oil] cos have told us that even if prices remain around current levels, there will be significant further cuts

LJKawa	720261489484017664	2016-04-13T14:44:55	If the BoC had minutes we could see the range of opinion on what members thought of rubber-stamping Finance's multipliers.
LJKawa	720260283269156864	2016-04-13T14:40:07	This is key. Who has estimated multiplier values for 2016? Take that guess away and BoC like IMF- gloomy outlook

LJKawa	720259911897243648	2016-04-13T14:38:39	It would be a relatively wonky Q to ask, but I would love to see a reporter ask Poloz why these 2009 multipliers are reasonable now.
LJKawa	720259478441037824	2016-04-13T14:36:56	Distinction: BoC isn't forecasting better growth due to +fiscal.  Finance is saying that.  BoC is saying the multiplier ests are reasonable.
LJKawa	720258493777899520	2016-04-13T14:33:01	BoC basically endorsed fiscal stim prior to budget. It would've been nutty for their estimates to deviate too much from Finance's bc of that
