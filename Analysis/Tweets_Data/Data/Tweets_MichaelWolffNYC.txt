MichaelWolffNYC	725689870539198465	2016-04-28T14:15:22	Probably not $200, probably not that small, and anyway the group most valuable to advertisers.

MichaelWolffNYC	725277641167757312	2016-04-27T10:57:19	I've been cross-posting to Medium for a while now, and have to say the engagement that people rave about, I'm not seeing it.
MichaelWolffNYC	725214696077418496	2016-04-27T06:47:12	If you think the shift to neo-feudalism &amp; paid (rather than ad-subsidized) services is unlikely, meet Hal Varian

MichaelWolffNYC	725013609655492608	2016-04-26T17:28:09	Well wouldn't say they are artistic or show business geniuses. Silly discussion. They and topolsky do diff things 
MichaelWolffNYC	724776652215996416	2016-04-26T01:46:34	Send me a card when you get it right. 
MichaelWolffNYC	724775821873917953	2016-04-26T01:43:16	To repeat, advertisers, who are paying the bills, aren't going to pay for better content 
MichaelWolffNYC	724775584467918849	2016-04-26T01:42:19	And that's why everybody wants into television. 
MichaelWolffNYC	724774530506461188	2016-04-26T01:38:08	MichaelWolffNYC No matter how many ways the question is phrased, I don't think you're going to give this guy the answer he's looking for...
MichaelWolffNYC	724774633870782464	2016-04-26T01:38:33	And since digital media is virtually 100% ad supported, will be a cold winter before such a change 
MichaelWolffNYC	724774183339745284	2016-04-26T01:36:45	I wouldn't exactly take that to the bank.  
MichaelWolffNYC	724774000778461185	2016-04-26T01:36:02	I'm all for pay.  
MichaelWolffNYC	724773827272671234	2016-04-26T01:35:20	But the history of ad support is quite static. 
MichaelWolffNYC	724773695512784896	2016-04-26T01:34:49	So are you but what am I? Come on. Try again.

MichaelWolffNYC	724773313634013184	2016-04-26T01:33:18	Did I miss some of your content? 
MichaelWolffNYC	724772673872502784	2016-04-26T01:30:45	Have you followed this conversation? I would say case in point.  
MichaelWolffNYC	724772464362803200	2016-04-26T01:29:55	Really not everybody. Quite an exaggeration. Take it back. 
MichaelWolffNYC	724772330166067200	2016-04-26T01:29:23	We call that a logical fallacy--that unknown events will alter reality and prove you right.  
MichaelWolffNYC	724772107968630784	2016-04-26T01:28:30	Draw me another. 
MichaelWolffNYC	724772000409899008	2016-04-26T01:28:05	I'm stuck alone in a hotel room in Mexico City. But don't you have a family?  
MichaelWolffNYC	724771690484359169	2016-04-26T01:26:51	Why do I have to? I don't care. I'm not making media now. I'm making a point. 
MichaelWolffNYC	724771511127527424	2016-04-26T01:26:08	Well, jeez, it is twitter. But since I've written as many words as anybody on the subject, wouldn't exactly say glib 
MichaelWolffNYC	724770750750556162	2016-04-26T01:23:07	Also, just to ask, what does topolsky, a tech administrator, know about content?  
MichaelWolffNYC	724770491068600320	2016-04-26T01:22:05	Hmm. Did I say that was the point? If so, no. Digital natives totally fucked. More because they know nothing else. 
MichaelWolffNYC	724770088067301376	2016-04-26T01:20:29	My point: the only content you CAN monetize is the cheap stuff. You can't put expensive content in direct mail. 
MichaelWolffNYC	724768037522399232	2016-04-26T01:12:20	I'll bite. What did you think was the point? And 'think piece' as opposed to 'no-thought piece'? 
MichaelWolffNYC	724758395136278529	2016-04-26T00:34:01	Well maybe a little committee.  
MichaelWolffNYC	724753309576257536	2016-04-26T00:13:48	Really? Group think? Twitter gangs? Haven't heard of this?  
MichaelWolffNYC	724751813644152832	2016-04-26T00:07:52	That's a fail? You must be on the team. Twitter. Too many teammates here. Try going it alone.

MichaelWolffNYC	724731312016228352	2016-04-25T22:46:24	What exactly are you going on about? I'm talking about economics of direct response advertising. 
MichaelWolffNYC	724727903817060352	2016-04-25T22:32:51	Digital is always trying to redefine. Things are what they are. And DR is DR, if you're lucky in life, not yr job 
MichaelWolffNYC	724726824488427520	2016-04-25T22:28:34	Billions? I'm a writer. But I do define success as a nice margin. 
MichaelWolffNYC	724726570942783490	2016-04-25T22:27:33	Oooh, conglomerates! My point is that all digital media companies think TV will rescue them. 
MichaelWolffNYC	724725693569859584	2016-04-25T22:24:04	I'm boring you? Not unheard of. But think your unduly optimistic about silver lining of a DR business.  
MichaelWolffNYC	724713553307934721	2016-04-25T21:35:50	But joshuatopolsky doesn't really get it right either. So try this:
