mathowie	722223597180231680	2016-04-19T00:41:38	dylanw BenchMadeModern Yeah, I am guessing they make a bunch of sides of couches, then cut the middle parts on CPU-controlled saw/drills.

mathowie	722219894054359040	2016-04-19T00:26:55	GlennF yeah, we had a microfiber sofa that was only $800 from Macy's (cheapest thing they sold) back in 2002 that finally gave up.

mathowie	722217117257322500	2016-04-19T00:15:53	GlennF but in the end it was only 1800 bucks with free shipping for a 94" wide sectional with their higher end fabric. I'm very happy w/ it
