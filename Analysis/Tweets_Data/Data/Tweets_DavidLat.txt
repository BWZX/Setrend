DavidLat	724683596942942208	2016-04-25T19:36:48	jeffjohnroberts And atlblog is very different; e.g., no longer a "tabloid" (your first graf). Now more industry news, career advice.
DavidLat	724683091701321728	2016-04-25T19:34:47	jeffjohnroberts Interesting! But 3 years is a long time in online media - &amp; our comments changed a lot in that period.

DavidLat	713119352246108161	2016-03-24T21:44:37	Cernovich Fair enough. But I don't think it's wrong for a Biglaw firm to be more mindful of collateral consequences of a representation.

DavidLat	710081335306690560	2016-03-16T12:32:37	And Garland might be more enthusiastic - his last chance to make SCOTUS history! (Even as sacrificial lamb.) 
DavidLat	710081093400133636	2016-03-16T12:31:39	I looked back at my 2012 correspondence w/ChrisGeidner; I mentioned Garland, Srinivasan, &amp; Watford for SCOTUS. 
DavidLat	709956835764269056	2016-03-16T04:17:54	Watford, Srinivasan, and Garland all made the list — with Watford being one of the four most popular picks: 
DavidLat	709956529039007749	2016-03-16T04:16:41	Back in Nov '12, I did a post on Obama's possible SCOTUS picks. The three shortlisters now were all on my panel's 11-person "shortlist."
DavidLat	710080487616876548	2016-03-16T12:29:15	I'm sticking with my prediction of Srinivasan for SCOTUS, but could Garland's age be a plus in this situation? See 
DavidLat	710079821284564993	2016-03-16T12:26:36	So Sri Srinivasan is 4 years below the mean age for a SCOTUS nominee &amp; Garland 10 years above.

DavidLat	709926032967606272	2016-03-16T02:15:30	I could see that; even someone as conservative as EdWhelanEPPC has said kinda nice things about Garland. SCOTUS

DavidLat	707803179547807744	2016-03-10T05:40:03	I'd love that. Lawyer Clinton would say something smart, Sanders would dodge w/a rant re: billionaires. DemDebate 
DavidLat	707779793010479104	2016-03-10T04:07:07	Agreed. FWIW, judges who interviewed with George W. Bush for SCOTUS said he didn't ask them about specific cases.

DavidLat	707776174768963584	2016-03-10T03:52:44	And HillaryClinton mentioned the need for the SCOTUS nominee to have "heart" (empathy?) &amp; great qualifications. 
DavidLat	707775435216703488	2016-03-10T03:49:48	Here you go: a DC law student asks HillaryClinton about her SCOTUS philosophy in light of abortion case before it.
