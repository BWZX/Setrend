davewiner	725876016032452610	2016-04-29T02:35:03	The Dems need to mobilize the comedians of America. A virtual writer's room open 24-by-7 ready to smack down any DJ Trump insult.

davewiner	725391283565563904	2016-04-27T18:28:53	But the biggest bottleneck for news is this -- 20-plus years into the web and we don't have a way to publish to all the places we need to.
