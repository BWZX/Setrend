GEQSense	724750085339271169	2016-04-26T00:01:00	To me aapl is in danger of being left behind. No WoW factor. The same repetitive designs every year. No innovation.
GEQSense	724749893143666688	2016-04-26T00:00:14	I will be short aapl before earnings. If it dips $1 or $2 i will make my $1000 and move on. I don’t have any plans of staying.

GEQSense	721368102772932608	2016-04-16T16:02:12	The reality is clear for oil.   It’s all up to the vacuum tubes to pervert their own sense of reality now.
GEQSense	721367845708271616	2016-04-16T16:01:11	Even my corp / prop trading clients aren’t short oil into tomorrow.   That tells you the degree of hesitance to short.
GEQSense	721367565042196480	2016-04-16T16:00:04	It is a negative feedback loop. Oil goes up - moar producers come online. Bring it to $60, shale goes full retard.
GEQSense	721367454631329792	2016-04-16T15:59:38	And if Oil pops tomorrow, hedgies won’t put money to work. Big money does things slowly.   And who is left to buy oil? Seriously.
GEQSense	721367321978150912	2016-04-16T15:59:06	So if oil drops tomorrow - all these idiots overly long will dump dump dump thus exacerbating the drop.
GEQSense	721367228302528512	2016-04-16T15:58:44	So let’s kind of look at the oil markets pragmatically.   Oil shorts are at their lowest since 2014.
GEQSense	721367079484592130	2016-04-16T15:58:08	GEQSense oil bulls are dreaming. The cartel is dead. It's a commodity market again. Price competition for market share and consolidation
GEQSense	721366904405819392	2016-04-16T15:57:27	If you suck at math u will suck as a trader. If u suck at budgetting, u will suck as a trader.
GEQSense	721366785468067840	2016-04-16T15:56:58	Most traders keep profits in and then overtrade or the more common one: trade bigger coz they have moar.
GEQSense	721366660632825857	2016-04-16T15:56:28	The diff between me and other idiot traders is I wire out my profits weekly. So I always begin every monday with $2M even.
GEQSense	721366368164024321	2016-04-16T15:55:19	Tomorrow I could stand to lose As much as $60,000. Prolly will be my biggest loss in a decade if Oil pops.
GEQSense	721366256515883008	2016-04-16T15:54:52	Sure i will hAve $15,000 or $25,000 down days but i end up positive every week.
GEQSense	721366171446956034	2016-04-16T15:54:32	I will stay as a trader until my $2M trading account gets taken out. It hasn’t gone below that year over year since 2010.
GEQSense	721365922959663104	2016-04-16T15:53:33	Then the great reset will happen when they realize humans are still better trading than machines.
GEQSense	721365830475223041	2016-04-16T15:53:10	So maybe 5 yrs from now machines completely takeover. But then maybe that will be the last step to finally break the market.
GEQSense	721365647540654080	2016-04-16T15:52:27	If I wasn’t a trader, I would’ve never seen the imminent oil collapse therefore wouldn’t have asked my dad to liquidate oil shares.
GEQSense	721365530276331520	2016-04-16T15:51:59	Trading has afforded me a lifestyle that supersedes the need to worry about downturns. I can see things before they happen.

GEQSense	721364830473445376	2016-04-16T15:49:12	.. At least you retired when you no longer have anything to pay for. Now u n mom can just travel…
GEQSense	721364710566670337	2016-04-16T15:48:43	I told my dad last yr: it could be worse. U could be like other guys with 3 young kids and a $400K house to pay for.
GEQSense	721364409306644480	2016-04-16T15:47:32	One time I bumped into my dad’s CFO at some AMEX biz lounge, i fcking told him: how do f8ckheads not hedge for lower oil prices?!?!?
GEQSense	721364003985838080	2016-04-16T15:45:55	My dad is like every other pleb who bot the story - work hard, get a good job, and u can prosper. I grew up a middle class kid.
GEQSense	721363758367412225	2016-04-16T15:44:56	I would never understand how it feel though but this man dedicated 35 yrs of his life to the company. So in a way maybe he felt betrayed.
GEQSense	721363596089765889	2016-04-16T15:44:18	Never seen my dad cry in my entire life not until he got told he had to be let go last year. It was heartbreaking to watch.
GEQSense	721362929585668101	2016-04-16T15:41:39	GEQSense a good son taking care of the old man. Great to hear!!
GEQSense	721363245420847105	2016-04-16T15:42:54	Is my dad depressed? Of course. But he’s getting better. He’s more accepting of reality now than say a year ago.
GEQSense	721362876758241280	2016-04-16T15:41:26	So I reckon $10K a month is a sweet deal for my parents just chillin up in Saus town.
GEQSense	721362781522374656	2016-04-16T15:41:04	I trade some of my dad’s retirement and yield $10K a month for him. His house is paid off. No debts. No loans.
GEQSense	721362558033092608	2016-04-16T15:40:10	So only his idiot and blind colleagues are stuck with shares half their value now.
GEQSense	721362444166127616	2016-04-16T15:39:43	But it’s cool though, I got him to SELL all of his employee purchased shares back in Nov 2014 at oil highs.
GEQSense	721362298393075712	2016-04-16T15:39:08	And if not already known, my victim is a victim of the oil downturn. He got forced to retire early 2015 bec u know, “budget cuts”
GEQSense	721362008784809984	2016-04-16T15:37:59	“Saudi used to carry the swing supply.. Cutting when able to prop priced up. How can they do that now w/ Iran in the game?”
GEQSense	721361831474757633	2016-04-16T15:37:17	Dad goes on to say..  These guys just don’t understand that rebalancing has to mean cutting like they did in 1998 or 2001.
GEQSense	721361702776770561	2016-04-16T15:36:46	My dad used to be an oil company exec for 36 yrs. so i would say he understands the game pretty well.
GEQSense	721361520269991936	2016-04-16T15:36:03	My dad this am.. D: so u shorted right?  M: yup D: what u do if u win?  M: buying myself a friggin super car  D: right on   *both laugh*

GEQSense	721359200715022341	2016-04-16T15:26:50	And conspiracy blogs been saying this wkend so far that maybe the FED knows there’ll be no deal so they planned emergency meetings.
GEQSense	721359011354791937	2016-04-16T15:26:05	A no deal tomorrow could finally trigger the Spoos selloff everyone’s been waitin for.
GEQSense	721358753170206726	2016-04-16T15:25:03	Another thing that analysts pretend to ignore is that Saudi really hates Iran and vice versa. These two are like oil and water.
GEQSense	721358555748646912	2016-04-16T15:24:16	Maybe the idiots had go pretend on tv coz they themselves are long OIL. But it’s funny af.

GEQSense	718828956565123073	2016-04-09T15:52:33	I sold short after that b!tch Yellen talked and i got raped. They took it 20 pts above my short entry.   Fcking asshats.
GEQSense	718828678642139137	2016-04-09T15:51:26	If I sell short tom eve and the bastard pops to 2055, what am I gonna do? Do I crawl under a rock and cry? Do I drink more scotch?
GEQSense	718828477441380352	2016-04-09T15:50:38	Everyone so far on blogs is calling for a short. I understand and agree with their logic and thesis. Question is, when?
GEQSense	718828034669740032	2016-04-09T15:48:53	All you gotta replenish errday is your patience.   I'm generally an impatient guy hence I try not to reply to idiotic msgs and emails. Hahah
GEQSense	718827856298532865	2016-04-09T15:48:10	The one thing I do love about the advisory business is the fact that there is no inventory to replenish and no supply chain to manage.
GEQSense	718826293182144513	2016-04-09T15:41:58	To anyone who thinks they r d sh!t, open up a Pro Bono Trader Help service.   Kinda like Legal Aid for the plebs.   Do it.

GEQSense	718825824678387713	2016-04-09T15:40:06	Every day i get a bleeding heart email or msg about how they need help coz they lost $$ in the markets.   Every day.
GEQSense	718825515671359489	2016-04-09T15:38:52	Leave your ego out the door and pick it up on the way out.   I don’t know what the future holds for our company. But it’s still doing fine.
GEQSense	718825318224539649	2016-04-09T15:38:05	Equity Sense… What is our mission really? It’s more of an outreach program to those wanna be helped. Emphasis on wanna be helped.
GEQSense	718825007338496000	2016-04-09T15:36:51	But these two kids r in danger coz if they can’t find a 3rd guy, the class shall be cancelled. Hahahaha.
GEQSense	718824923146260480	2016-04-09T15:36:31	Two guys already confirming a forex crash course next Saturday. Guess my USDJPY tweets got to em.
GEQSense	718824759002144768	2016-04-09T15:35:52	It’ll be like an a la carte style where you pick a topic, then schedule the class on a Sat or Sun of your choosing.
GEQSense	718824635614138368	2016-04-09T15:35:22	What people want now is to have a list of topics to choose from to have a crash course on. Not a bad idea.
GEQSense	718824481100161024	2016-04-09T15:34:46	Two wks of these crash courses.  Feedback’s been great. We’ve had a ton of suggestions. People love the Saturday and Sunday offerings.

GEQSense	718822760923795456	2016-04-09T15:27:55	Realized losses were on ES and some oil daytrades.   Didn’t lose any $$ on stock trades this week. Then again i was being cautious.
GEQSense	718822605814280192	2016-04-09T15:27:18	Last wk I made a lil over $110,000. 80% of that was USDJPY.   unrealized Losses of $12,000, all on OIL short.   $24k of realized losses
GEQSense	718822016451608576	2016-04-09T15:24:58	Western firms are all tapped out. They follow Goldman blindly. Hahahahahha
GEQSense	718821934381682688	2016-04-09T15:24:38	A really bright spot for us is Asia. A lot of small firms wanting more exposure and info into the markets.
GEQSense	718821752403394560	2016-04-09T15:23:55	One of the former bank traders who is now a client of mine made over $40,000 shorting USDJPY w/ me this wk.
GEQSense	718821565073207297	2016-04-09T15:23:10	Perhaps that’s the sign. Perhaps retail isn’t where we are supposed to be in the future.   Who knows.
GEQSense	718821444159811585	2016-04-09T15:22:42	The one thing that continues to grow gradually is our SME clientele. They remain happy with our services.
GEQSense	718820914775719937	2016-04-09T15:20:35	Human nature: We all want the best return for the littlest cost to us as possible.   If we get something for nothing, even better.
GEQSense	718820378458464256	2016-04-09T15:18:27	If u can find people who will keep giving u trade ideas for free and it works 70% of the time, why u even bothering me? Hahahahaha
GEQSense	718820243724836865	2016-04-09T15:17:55	Then there are those assholes who email me asking why i even charge when other peeps give ideas for free. Bitch plz. Seriously.
GEQSense	718820047414697985	2016-04-09T15:17:08	Can’t plan on earnings that fluctuate from $20,000 to $30,000 then down to $10,000 a month due to monthly turnovers.
GEQSense	718819871492943872	2016-04-09T15:16:27	And this goes back to why I’m a trader first and foremost coz man, if I rely on my client’s $150 a month, I’d be a poor mofo.
GEQSense	718819044946644992	2016-04-09T15:13:09	You’ll never be able to make all your clients happy. Such is the nature of any service business. But take care of the ones you can.
GEQSense	718818867888263169	2016-04-09T15:12:27	Those of you planning to start a sub service: take care of your loyal clients, ignore the dumb ones who quit too easily.
GEQSense	718818490681937920	2016-04-09T15:10:57	If the minimum wage clients of ours can make money, there is no excuse for those kids who r rich unless they really aren’t cut out for this.
GEQSense	718818341775745025	2016-04-09T15:10:22	Bec u know why? A walmart employee who has been with us since 2012 has been able to make $$ off of our ideas. Why can’t these other kids?
GEQSense	718818158291734528	2016-04-09T15:09:38	My staff gets worried each time a subscriber quits. I tell them not to worry. Those are the kids who are too dumb to use our ideas.
GEQSense	718817537589313536	2016-04-09T15:07:10	You are the epitome of what clients should be - respectful, kind and enthusiastic. :) not the dickheads who just wanna be spoonfed.

GEQSense	718817047090737152	2016-04-09T15:05:13	What was that? Why did that stock move?   We find out and we trade why. It’s that simple.    AAPL VRX
GEQSense	718816749265625093	2016-04-09T15:04:02	This wk has shown us no matter what, someone out there is “visibly” buying this market whatever it takes.
GEQSense	718816181117845504	2016-04-09T15:01:47	Then again I wouldn’t be shocked everyone reports badly and spx goes to new highs.
