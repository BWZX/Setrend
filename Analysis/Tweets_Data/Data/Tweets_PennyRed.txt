PennyRed	722168030902419457	2016-04-18T21:00:50	PennyRed Laurie, you forget that white men, because they do not have a race or a gender, do not have identities or need identity politics.

PennyRed	722167561736089600	2016-04-18T20:58:58	Tell me, what distinguishes 'identity politics' from all other politics? What makes it less important?
PennyRed	722167341920952322	2016-04-18T20:58:06	Every time someone bitches about 'identity politics' I hear it as 'politics that takes race and gender into account and is therefore bad.'
PennyRed	722167014412980224	2016-04-18T20:56:48	There is, in fact, no such thing as 'identity politics.' Unless you interpret all politics as identity politics, which is legitimate.
