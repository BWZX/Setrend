jeremybowers	711626677055401984	2016-03-20T18:53:15	zubakskees jeremybmerrill collinskeith That paragraph is super-useful without the encryption assertion. Especially when it’s not sourced.

jeremybowers	711624046815739904	2016-03-20T18:42:48	jeremybmerrill collinskeith But that, of course, is probably a bad assertion.
jeremybowers	711623969988710401	2016-03-20T18:42:30	jeremybmerrill collinskeith Possibly best way to phrase this: Being a terrorist, not the terminal output, was suggestive of encryption.

jeremybowers	693580501857103872	2016-01-30T23:44:12	thejqs Oh, I bet it’s lycopene, which is the stuff that stains your plastic orange.
jeremybowers	693580249934622720	2016-01-30T23:43:12	thejqs Can’t believe it’s yellow. Something in the tomato skin, I suspect. Also, the cinchona and the cherry bark.
jeremybowers	693580029419089920	2016-01-30T23:42:19	mkramer I think you’re right re: Carbonara and dry.
jeremybowers	693579914520297474	2016-01-30T23:41:52	mkramer Curious because me and beckybowers want to start making our own.
jeremybowers	693579748522393600	2016-01-30T23:41:12	mkramer Did y’all make the pasta too?
jeremybowers	693579111453761536	2016-01-30T23:38:40	ryanpitts ofadam I was surprised; it’s so inside baseball I couldn’t believe others would like it. But they do!
jeremybowers	693578864522457088	2016-01-30T23:37:42	aboutaaron kaeti Plus y’all need to meet TheSqueezle who needs some more good role models like darlacameron.
jeremybowers	693578773262774272	2016-01-30T23:37:20	kaeti aboutaaron Alright, gonna find a day and let’s just make this happen.

jeremybowers	693576209226027008	2016-01-30T23:27:08	A_L I will do this. For the good of the community. I’ll also source jwscoop for more recommendations.

jeremybowers	693574175940739072	2016-01-30T23:19:04	aboutaaron It was a couple of pounds of tomatoes in overproof rum since August.
jeremybowers	693574095523319808	2016-01-30T23:18:45	aboutaaron   1. Yessir. See photo. 2. YES. But only once IA and NH are over because I am dead until then. 
jeremybowers	693573688105394176	2016-01-30T23:17:07	jwscoop beckybowers I don’t disagree. You’ll have to taste it.

jeremybowers	693573296957161472	2016-01-30T23:15:34	aschweig Oh, yeah, yours is coming.
jeremybowers	693573234332028928	2016-01-30T23:15:19	jwscoop Rebranding. beckybowers thinks it’s more -cello than eau de vie.
jeremybowers	693569494350970880	2016-01-30T23:00:28	2016 Tomatocello bottled; bittered with gentian, cherry bark, Angelica and cinchona. 
jeremybowers	693516395854893057	2016-01-30T19:29:28	eads palewire derekwillis Oh, I totally had a version using ORM and .update() queries that was breathtakingly slow.
jeremybowers	693515693053120514	2016-01-30T19:26:40	derekwillis eads palewire So many feels WRT this.
jeremybowers	693515533824692224	2016-01-30T19:26:02	eads palewire derekwillis My basic feeling: Only build the new thing if you’re gonna roll really deep on it.
jeremybowers	693513062066839553	2016-01-30T19:16:13	andrewkueneman Andrew.
jeremybowers	693503211735498752	2016-01-30T18:37:05	donkeyandgoat Y’all are the best. Thanks for what you do!
jeremybowers	693500296333516800	2016-01-30T18:25:29	palewire derekwillis eads You know, boyer always says: “Engineers like to engineer things.” It’s good to catch yourself doing bad.
jeremybowers	693500160681312256	2016-01-30T18:24:57	palewire derekwillis But was worth it for a variety of small reasons. And glad eads got on board early so we solve the right problems.
jeremybowers	693499942158073856	2016-01-30T18:24:05	palewire derekwillis eads I very reluctantly replaced harrisj’s code this year. A vast internal struggle about unknown unknowns.
jeremybowers	693498938297548800	2016-01-30T18:20:06	jeremybowers palewire derekwillis eads Which is to say, I would be much slower and way less modular.
jeremybowers	693498877614411777	2016-01-30T18:19:51	jeremybowers palewire derekwillis If not for eads, I would be running Django mgmt commands with Elex as a Python module.
jeremybowers	693498656780083200	2016-01-30T18:18:59	donkeyandgoat Lovely. I’ve had it three times in my life and it’s my white whale. Will order when it’s available.
jeremybowers	693498512256933888	2016-01-30T18:18:24	DUQE Also secretly working on a hibiscus-based campari recipe right now.
jeremybowers	693498443738800129	2016-01-30T18:18:08	DUQE Absolutely. Floral negronis are definitely gonna be a thing.
jeremybowers	693498371005386753	2016-01-30T18:17:50	palewire derekwillis Honestly, best eads contribution to Elex was “this should be a CLI” because that was genius.
jeremybowers	693498261735358464	2016-01-30T18:17:24	palewire derekwillis Or worse, library is made to solve your own specific problems and not a general problem.
jeremybowers	693498148338208768	2016-01-30T18:16:57	palewire derekwillis  1. Build a thing 2. Extract a library 3. Rebuild the thing 4. Library blows in the wind, alone
jeremybowers	693498044327792641	2016-01-30T18:16:32	asmallteapot I actually kinda hate gin which is why I’m making my own. To heck with everyone else’s wacky crap.
jeremybowers	693497500326559744	2016-01-30T18:14:23	asmallteapot Can you even IMAGINE a lavender gin? OMFG
jeremybowers	693497391476011008	2016-01-30T18:13:57	asmallteapot Again, because of insanity.
jeremybowers	693497350237593600	2016-01-30T18:13:47	asmallteapot I also bought a pound of juniper berries and I have been making single-ingredient bitters, e.g., wormwood, cinchona, angelica.
jeremybowers	693497188077432832	2016-01-30T18:13:08	donkeyandgoat My one regret in life is how hard it is to get Stone Crusher in DC. But had some at Komi a few months back.
jeremybowers	693496970804076544	2016-01-30T18:12:17	asmallteapot Making gin for the spring because I am literally insane.
