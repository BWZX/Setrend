ShaneGoldmacher	725123517851795456	2016-04-27T00:44:53	If he wins 60% in a Rhode Island CD, Trump will only win 1 of the 3 delegates.

ShaneGoldmacher	712063332015022083	2016-03-21T23:48:22	Ted Cruz has been polling a possible 'unity ticket' with Marco Rubio 
ShaneGoldmacher	712057585281544193	2016-03-21T23:25:32	Cruz had promised to use AIPAC to "highlight Trump’s positions – or lack thereof." No new contrasts today beside opening jab re: Palestine.
ShaneGoldmacher	712056841161801728	2016-03-21T23:22:34	“The nation of Israel like America is a beacon of light unto the world,” Cruz says, using his father's story to explain his Israel stance.
ShaneGoldmacher	712055011287638016	2016-03-21T23:15:18	And Cruz goes after Trump by name — for Trump's stance to renegotiate Iran deal, rather than "rip it apart" as Cruz has promised.
ShaneGoldmacher	712054691677478912	2016-03-21T23:14:02	Bloomberg, Gillibrand and Graham — quite the trifecta of mentions from Cruz

ShaneGoldmacher	712051460951900161	2016-03-21T23:01:12	Speech so notable because it was such a dramatic stylistic break for Trump 
ShaneGoldmacher	712050794342830080	2016-03-21T22:58:33	If there were protests, they weren't visible to me. Trump reception remarkably similar to Kasich's — positive, with some laughs.

ShaneGoldmacher	712049581786324992	2016-03-21T22:53:44	Donald Trump opened this speech saying he wasn't a politician about to "pander." He's rarely sounded more like a politician.
ShaneGoldmacher	712048200765538305	2016-03-21T22:48:14	"And when I say something I mean it," he added.
ShaneGoldmacher	712048118263619587	2016-03-21T22:47:55	"When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one."
ShaneGoldmacher	712047690490748928	2016-03-21T22:46:13	"Believe me" is actually in Trump's prepared text.

ShaneGoldmacher	712040835823566848	2016-03-21T22:18:58	"There is a side to be taken," Paul Ryan says at AIPAC in aside that's not in his prepared text and that seems a swipe at Trump.
ShaneGoldmacher	712038242472824833	2016-03-21T22:08:40	For all the heat over Obama/Castro presser (&amp; photo) IsaacDovere talks about why it was actually a really big deal: 
ShaneGoldmacher	712037852289343496	2016-03-21T22:07:07	NickRiccardi mostly fascinated by why the stage would rotate in different directions for different speakers!
ShaneGoldmacher	712037488504803328	2016-03-21T22:05:40	The stage is rotating counter-clockwise for Paul Ryan. It rotated clockwise for John Kasich. dontknowwhatthatmeansorwhy
ShaneGoldmacher	712036878250348544	2016-03-21T22:03:15	"It's always a good thing when America's leaders declare their support for Israel," Paul Ryan opens.
ShaneGoldmacher	712035842295013376	2016-03-21T21:59:08	Kasich kept his speech in a white binder.
ShaneGoldmacher	712035385761779714	2016-03-21T21:57:19	“I will not take the low road to the highest office int eh land. I will not do it,” he adds to big applause.
ShaneGoldmacher	712035295378669569	2016-03-21T21:56:58	“We are Americans before we are Republicans or Democrats," Kasich says to bipartisan AIPAC crowd.
ShaneGoldmacher	712034364738179072	2016-03-21T21:53:16	Kasish says Palestinians cannot “promote a culture of hatred and death.”   Huge applause.
ShaneGoldmacher	712033614834192384	2016-03-21T21:50:17	Kasich is delivering specifics and expertise but not passion in AIPAC address. Reading speech is a big part of that. Often, he just riffs.

ShaneGoldmacher	712032732256329728	2016-03-21T21:46:46	Essentially Kasich's message: I “don’t need on the job training.”
ShaneGoldmacher	712032572897955841	2016-03-21T21:46:08	Unlike Cruz, Kasich won't call for ripping up Iran deal do but threatens to reimpose sanctions if they violate "one crossed t" in accord
ShaneGoldmacher	712031777787924480	2016-03-21T21:42:59	Also, his lectern is spinning around the circular stage. Ever. So. Slowly.
ShaneGoldmacher	712031629372428289	2016-03-21T21:42:24	Kasich still talking about serving on "House Armed Services Committee" in the year of the outsider.
