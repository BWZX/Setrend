jyarow	694273797185245184	2016-02-01T21:39:06	ericjackson The key is extreme conditions unlike what *we've experienced*. Apple has never experience slow economy and slow product!
jyarow	694272654937845760	2016-02-01T21:34:34	ericjackson Yeah. I think the difference is that in 09, Apple had a new product. This time, softening economy and product saturation

jyarow	694143764479213568	2016-02-01T13:02:24	IMO, Twitter should make Moments a standalone product.

jyarow	693982783388172288	2016-02-01T02:22:43	MicahSingleton Eh. I think FB would help grow the product at a better pace. Twitter has a gun against its head right now tx to stock price.

jyarow	693977803188998144	2016-02-01T02:02:56	TheStalwart So, if a company was to buy Twitter FB would be the best outcome I think.
jyarow	693977684385386497	2016-02-01T02:02:28	TheStalwart But I think that FB doesn't have real time, so Twitter would add that. And I think FB would relieve some monetization pressure.
jyarow	693977487416659969	2016-02-01T02:01:41	saralivingston Yeah. Way too many options.
jyarow	693977384551333890	2016-02-01T02:01:16	TheStalwart They wouldn't. I hope they can stay independent and successful.
