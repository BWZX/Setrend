MSGCapital	701901251802439680	2016-02-22T22:47:53	Correct. I would, and I have and I would do it again. But we're professionals trained to deal w/crackhead tenants.

MSGCapital	701890681392992256	2016-02-22T22:05:53	.ParisJOM Umm...not exactly. Vol blowing up would indicate a busy market and we would then make money as market-makers to offset the loss.
MSGCapital	701889240695750656	2016-02-22T22:00:10	Just meaning that if your position went against you there was good "trade" to make money and offset the loss. 
MSGCapital	701886519003455490	2016-02-22T21:49:21	In the "old" days if you were short and vol blew up that meant there was trade you could make $ off to pay for it. 
MSGCapital	701884881006174208	2016-02-22T21:42:50	.Buy_Mortimer I'm just trying to figure out the value of that chart and what it infers.
MSGCapital	701884738735382528	2016-02-22T21:42:16	.Buy_Mortimer Couldn't that number be skewed by a huge number of "teeny" opts open, or conversely a huge "guts" position of deep ITM opts?
MSGCapital	701882178205052928	2016-02-22T21:32:06	Buy_Mortimer So a smaller number would indicate a higher OI in OTM opts vs higher delta opts?
MSGCapital	701881494273392642	2016-02-22T21:29:23	Buy_Mortimer Got it.  And what does this tell us one way or another (again this is a totally new metric for me)?
MSGCapital	701880915472097280	2016-02-22T21:27:05	Buy_Mortimer Ok this is a new one for me...so is this telling us that the average delta of an open option now is around .25?
MSGCapital	701880528287432705	2016-02-22T21:25:32	.ParisJOM If you think vol is low and a moderate move is possible then buying the straddle selling the wings (Iron Condor) is the play.
MSGCapital	701880245226512385	2016-02-22T21:24:25	Buy_Mortimer Sorry but what exactly am I looking at?
MSGCapital	701878451960205313	2016-02-22T21:17:17	Perhaps you're thinking of an Iron Condor? Buy the straddle and sell wings to finance it (synthetic short Condor). 
MSGCapital	701877880209457152	2016-02-22T21:15:01	If you consistently traded long options in 85, 86, 87 you "paid the bills" and then went on to make millions in 88. 
MSGCapital	701877262346489856	2016-02-22T21:12:34	.ParisJOM Totally different strategies...a long condor is indicated for a range market that you don't believe will move outside the wings.
MSGCapital	701875107409633281	2016-02-22T21:04:00	As an opt trader there is very little movement required now to pay for a long position all while having an intrinsic lottery ticket built-in
MSGCapital	701874237502578688	2016-02-22T21:00:33	2016 could def be a flat px year in grains but assuming not a single hiccup before the ground is even thawed is a bit presumptuous.
MSGCapital	701872741323038720	2016-02-22T20:54:36	If you have any hedging to do in the soybean market these levels of option vol are like getting a massive cut to your insurance rates.
MSGCapital	701872281128189952	2016-02-22T20:52:46	Purely my opinion, but I believe that even the current 60 cent limit is too wide and straddles are a bargain.

MSGCapital	701871053207896067	2016-02-22T20:47:53	Being facetious obv, and I am aware we are stuck in a range, but there is an unprecedented lack of risk premium in the options right now.

MSGCapital	681928772426285056	2015-12-29T20:04:23	Being a tourist in Key West @ Captain Tony's Saloon 
MSGCapital	681857086762921984	2015-12-29T15:19:32	+100. You can only f#&amp;k the customer once and they're done. We WANT the customers to make money and come back!

MSGCapital	681855053804781569	2015-12-29T15:11:27	Of course and I settled bean opts on NYE for many years but above all consistency and between the bid/ask is primary 
MSGCapital	681843639455191040	2015-12-29T14:26:06	Normally I'd chalk it up to CMEGroup incompetence but it is the end of the year and a big short CSO trader is in the ear of the exchange.
MSGCapital	681843214094053376	2015-12-29T14:24:24	NX CSO 20 calls settled 5.5 on 12/23, 3.1 on 12/24 (incorrect underlying), and 2.7 on 12/28.
MSGCapital	681842841740554240	2015-12-29T14:22:56	So w/NX in a 2-3 cent range, the CSO 40 calls settled 3.5 on 12/23, 2.0 on 12/24 (incorrect underlying), and 1.0 yesterday.
MSGCapital	681841686335602689	2015-12-29T14:18:20	statFutures Speechless but not surprised.
MSGCapital	681841572267356160	2015-12-29T14:17:53	In "fixing" the NX CSOs yesterday by using the correct underlying (10c higher than 12/24) somehow calls lost value...some by 50%...
MSGCapital	681839491125014529	2015-12-29T14:09:37	In How-Not-To-Run-An-Exchange news, CMEGroup settled every NX Soybean CSO on 12/24 based on NX 10 cents lower than it's actual settlement.
