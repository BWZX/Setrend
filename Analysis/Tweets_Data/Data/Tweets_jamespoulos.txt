jamespoulos	695340748628070400	2016-02-04T20:18:47	yeselson It's not just a difference in quality, it's a difference in kind. That needs to be captured.

jamespoulos	695339858336706561	2016-02-04T20:15:15	yeselson I think it's fascistic. But clearly not on its own FASCISM. consistent with logic and practice of fascist regime
