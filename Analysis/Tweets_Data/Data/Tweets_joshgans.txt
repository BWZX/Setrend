joshgans	683787080128933888	2016-01-03T23:08:38	OSorenson I know that. But it is far from obvious to me that leads to increased inequality in general equilibrium.
joshgans	683785097665970176	2016-01-03T23:00:46	There are a few macro papers that try and tackle the entrepreneurship/inequality question. They have mixed results. Will try and parse tmrw

joshgans	683781584902860800	2016-01-03T22:46:48	OSorenson sorensenjesperb Yes but my discussion was about tech or growth entrepreneurship as was Grahams.
joshgans	683778633568235524	2016-01-03T22:35:04	OSorenson Look at this.  First hit, no difference despite rhetoric in the paper.
joshgans	683778379313770496	2016-01-03T22:34:04	OSorenson My guess is that you won’t find the Gini coefficient for SV statistically different from that of the US.
joshgans	683777758426742785	2016-01-03T22:31:36	OSorenson No that is what I want to see a reference for. Does SV have a high Gini? Where’s that ref?
joshgans	683777462380138498	2016-01-03T22:30:25	OSorenson sorensenjesperb There is no entrepreneurship of the sort Graham is talking about in that paper.
joshgans	683776734555168770	2016-01-03T22:27:32	OSorenson Reference? And you mean real entrepreneurship right not bus formation?
