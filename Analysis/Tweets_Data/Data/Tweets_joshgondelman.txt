joshgondelman	713392003296440321	2016-03-25T15:48:02	Not a comedian, but anyamarina writes amazing songs and performs covers in an incredibly personal, tender way.
joshgondelman	713391684864905216	2016-03-25T15:46:46	For an international comedy star, JosieLong is somehow funnier and kinder than you'd think possible of any person.
joshgondelman	713391383621603328	2016-03-25T15:45:34	Whenever someone I know sees a show that michelleisawolf is on, all they can talk about after is how great Michelle is.
joshgondelman	713390996235673604	2016-03-25T15:44:02	Every time dopequeenpheebs writes a new joke I'm like: "GAH! PERFECT!"
joshgondelman	713390738051084288	2016-03-25T15:43:00	I am inspired by the way tedalexandro is such a hilarious comedian and a righteous person without compromising either.
joshgondelman	713390540654555136	2016-03-25T15:42:13	It's pretty wild how RonFunches makes comedy look as easy as breathing.  (Spoiler: It's not! He's just great at it!)
joshgondelman	713390225888817152	2016-03-25T15:40:58	Every time I think MrEmilyHeller couldn't possibly get funnier, she gets funnier.
joshgondelman	713389997668319232	2016-03-25T15:40:04	When I watch _chrisgarcia tell jokes I'm like: "Wow this is great, and I am so glad I don't have to follow him destroying."
joshgondelman	713389614741004288	2016-03-25T15:38:32	It is astounding to watch the way erinjudge makes complicated expressions of gender and sexuality so clear and funny.
joshgondelman	713389294166089728	2016-03-25T15:37:16	There is maybe no one who fuses observation and whimsy as well as emmyblotnick.
joshgondelman	713389021230153728	2016-03-25T15:36:11	It should literally be illegal to be as INSANELY funny as CyAmundson is and also as good at sports and handsome as he is too.
joshgondelman	713388757110620161	2016-03-25T15:35:08	First, kurtbraunohler is funny in so many ways that it makes me feel like I've only ever used 5 letters of the comedy alphabet.

joshgondelman	713380127493779456	2016-03-25T15:00:51	Weird how Ted Cruz's sex scandal isn't about his explicitly stated position on women's reproductive health. Seems worse.
