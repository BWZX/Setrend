ronlieber	707938513535299584	2016-03-10T14:37:49	@843SLS1 boxes cost dry ice delivery agita on other end blah blah blah blah. is it too much to just to expect to be able to do it myself?!
ronlieber	707936231368343554	2016-03-10T14:28:45	@843SLS1 That is what I'm afraid of. Is it better to risk that or the stuff thawing in the checked bag (or it being f.cked w by inspector)?
ronlieber	707934581043957764	2016-03-10T14:22:11	@843SLS1 AskTSA just corrected him/her/itself, so it seems as if I'm good to go. Thanks.
ronlieber	707934436415938561	2016-03-10T14:21:37	AskTSA Thanks. Can you pls reply &amp; confirm that yours is the last word on the official policy so that I can show this thread to the agent?
ronlieber	707932575449354240	2016-03-10T14:14:13	@843SLS1 Think I'm unreasonable not wanting to check it? Seems like this use case oughta allow a dad to bring as much thru as he wants.
ronlieber	707928382697312256	2016-03-10T13:57:33	@843SLS1 Site does not say anything about reasonable, let alone reasonable for trip. I want to bring 5 days worth, not 3 hours. Sigh. Tks.
ronlieber	707927668516323328	2016-03-10T13:54:43	AskTSA Also, site says nothing re "for the flight." Which should be irrelevant anyway. Kid needs food for 5 day trip not just 3 hr flight.
ronlieber	707927342392483840	2016-03-10T13:53:25	AskTSA I need an answer to my actual question if you can please: Can I bring 5 days worth of food for my kid? 50 ounces? 100? 3/3
ronlieber	707927204370518016	2016-03-10T13:52:52	AskTSA The site makes no mention of the word "reasonable" &amp; that word gives agents the ability to turn me away if they think I have 2 much.
ronlieber	707927036782899200	2016-03-10T13:52:12	AskTSA Thanks but your reply both contradicts what the site says and is not specific enough. 1/3
