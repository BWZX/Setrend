deltaStrikejj	709416370899779584	2016-03-14T16:30:17	Would have been better off gap opening up instead of down for any real selloff today. Maybe fill that New Years gap overhead first

deltaStrikejj	700147138966106112	2016-02-18T02:37:40	QuantMess yeah just meant on the day it should be down more but different market now so its staying elevated
deltaStrikejj	700129431382134784	2016-02-18T01:27:18	Sea-Tac Airport reached 63°, breaking record high for today. Old record was 61° set long ago...in 2015. wawx RecordHigh AncientTimes
deltaStrikejj	700022098975043585	2016-02-17T18:20:48	1950 zone near that 50 day MA might come faster than I thought. And VIX barely coming down.
deltaStrikejj	700021845475479552	2016-02-17T18:19:48	Nice move in the S&amp;P! Been stuck in meetings this morning but see it's a nice trend day up. Taking some gains in short put spreads finally
deltaStrikejj	699969704501248000	2016-02-17T14:52:37	Just seems like these multiple standard dev moves happen left and right. gotta be nuts to sell naked options into earnings lol
deltaStrikejj	699969319254405120	2016-02-17T14:51:05	PCLN surpassing its 75 dollar "expected" move today on earnings. Really think option models are kinda flawed when this happens so much
deltaStrikejj	699967188577308672	2016-02-17T14:42:37	OptionsHawk these now bidding $2.20  
deltaStrikejj	699929163059306496	2016-02-17T12:11:31	Lol .. Did JPM recommend its own stock and called it a momo? 
deltaStrikejj	699963663759716352	2016-02-17T14:28:36	Oh please stop it.. 
deltaStrikejj	699959884981252097	2016-02-17T14:13:35	Traders thinking 1900 was tough resistance for SPX so it will probably reach for 1950 near that 50 day MA but not in straight line
deltaStrikejj	699648286488002562	2016-02-16T17:35:24	agwarner lol I would if I had a car wash!
deltaStrikejj	699647145721274368	2016-02-16T17:30:53	I see what u did there!   
deltaStrikejj	699646747002286081	2016-02-16T17:29:17	As long as SPX monthly is below 10 month MA all rallies are just trades in a longer term downtrend. Don't confuse a trade vs investment
deltaStrikejj	699645986033938433	2016-02-16T17:26:16	It's a long shot but would be pretty epic if SPX and gold intersected and traded same price this year. 1500?
deltaStrikejj	699606536230834178	2016-02-16T14:49:30	Pretty surprised implied vol not down much more. VIX must have priced in the long weekend on Friday
deltaStrikejj	699594612415995904	2016-02-16T14:02:08	Rally to the 50-day moving averages coming: DJIA = 16,562; S&amp;P 500 = 1,942: Russell = 1051; NASDAQ Comp. = 4,648 &amp; Mid-Cap = 1,325.
deltaStrikejj	699594688202874882	2016-02-16T14:02:26	GLD should open with a nice island reversal top. Maybe sees the 21 ema eventually before higher
deltaStrikejj	699442172114800640	2016-02-16T03:56:23	Ouch to the "deep otm" call buyer last week when gold went from 1200-1260.  deflategateoptionspremium GC_F 
deltaStrikejj	699425592895090688	2016-02-16T02:50:30	Options ex rally on schedule. Lots of shorts to squeeze, maybe see 50 day MA tested in the next few weeks  
deltaStrikejj	699290408702996480	2016-02-15T17:53:20	I just wanna book profits on my short bonds and gold trades Ughhh

deltaStrikejj	698159479523659776	2016-02-12T14:59:25	Nothing worse than being on the opposite side of a 3 standard deviation move.. But that's what worst case stops are for
deltaStrikejj	698158047370194944	2016-02-12T14:53:44	This woman Yellen owes me some damn money for making bonds go up so much! Glad I'm in March spreads at least so there's hope lol
deltaStrikejj	698154284412571650	2016-02-12T14:38:47	Gold implied Vol back to 24 after that crazy move up to 30 y'day GVZ
deltaStrikejj	697936067635249152	2016-02-12T00:11:40	Plenty hedge funds out there (and Goldman) who have been in this crowded gold short trade thinking it would breakdown under 1k..
deltaStrikejj	697935501429383169	2016-02-12T00:09:25	I really wonder if some hedge fund blew up today with that move in bonds or gold. Looked like forced liquidation on someone who was short
deltaStrikejj	697787479227674624	2016-02-11T14:21:13	Remember all those people talking bout 4 rate hikes this year LOL
deltaStrikejj	697783951193034754	2016-02-11T14:07:12	ES broke that January spike low and held it for now. Today being Thursday the week before options ex would be a nice day for a bottom
deltaStrikejj	697783540528775168	2016-02-11T14:05:34	Wow pure panic in the bonds overnight almost getting to 171 on ZB.

deltaStrikejj	697586546438897664	2016-02-11T01:02:47	Ackman down 18% already YTD after being down 20% last year in his fund? Why do people have any interest in guys like this is beyond me
deltaStrikejj	697565435709902848	2016-02-10T23:38:54	Whoever is buying bonds is starting to piss me off.

deltaStrikejj	696895283729297409	2016-02-09T03:15:57	but this complacent VIX has me cautious still, just doesn't feel like real panic yet, would need to see over 28 for upper bollinger band
deltaStrikejj	696894489600720896	2016-02-09T03:12:48	if SPX can get above and hold 1875 tmrw it could squeeze pretty good up to 1950 in time for Feb options ex next week
deltaStrikejj	696892559809875968	2016-02-09T03:05:08	OptionsHawk jeez didn't even see that chart lately, what kinda skeletons do these Euro banks have..
deltaStrikejj	696892104824360960	2016-02-09T03:03:20	bonds and gold i've been bullish on this year but at this point how can you not short some for a trade. TLT GLD

deltaStrikejj	684898576267280385	2016-01-07T00:45:20	to show how much Vegas likes the Seahawks.. in NFL playoff history only 3 road teams have been favored by 5+ pts.
deltaStrikejj	684883351463804928	2016-01-06T23:44:50	Nice! 
deltaStrikejj	684878589687271425	2016-01-06T23:25:54	Breaking: Ken Griffey Jr. Left Off Three Hall of Fame Ballots 
deltaStrikejj	684880348224827392	2016-01-06T23:32:54	Ken Griffey Jr. gets the call that he's in the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
deltaStrikejj	684881343549845504	2016-01-06T23:36:51	So who was the dope who didn't vote for Griffey? Amazing it wasn't 100 percent
deltaStrikejj	684797135708008448	2016-01-06T18:02:14	lalaruza74 actually they will.
deltaStrikejj	684747658381017089	2016-01-06T14:45:38	If in Seattle it would be $250 if lucky  
deltaStrikejj	684747175864045568	2016-01-06T14:43:43	SPEEROTHEKID oh shit I didn't even know he said that lol I never followed him just heard about him

deltaStrikejj	684739186499297282	2016-01-06T14:11:58	musicandwork lol oh I don't watch CNBC I just meant there Twitter alerts
deltaStrikejj	684738712295485440	2016-01-06T14:10:05	This basically nailed the top in AMZN 
deltaStrikejj	684738000702410753	2016-01-06T14:07:15	AAPL should get under 100 today. Been a dead name for awhile but media just now pointing out weakness. Where's Icahn?
deltaStrikejj	684735769638928384	2016-01-06T13:58:23	OptionsHawk nice call. Amazing how fast a brand can go downhill
deltaStrikejj	684472786270732289	2016-01-05T20:33:23	Thanks to STATS_NFL:   The coldest Seahawks games dating back to '91:

deltaStrikejj	684387890772615170	2016-01-05T14:56:03	Jan Options ex week already next week so would make sense for yesterday to be at or near a swing low zone. SPY
deltaStrikejj	684385681758552066	2016-01-05T14:47:16	NoTime2Sleep
deltaStrikejj	684159196951003137	2016-01-04T23:47:18	Nice vol expansion today to sell some premium into. Great way to start the year
deltaStrikejj	684022913897332736	2016-01-04T14:45:45	Nailed this sentiment recently. Everyone seemed long the AMZN's of the world..  
deltaStrikejj	683878554610741248	2016-01-04T05:12:07	ParkResearch its a strange scenario but yea they said since Seattle won today they would have been 5 if GB won.
deltaStrikejj	683878177052086272	2016-01-04T05:10:37	ParkResearch they would have played Vikings at home if they won tonight. so a rematch. tougher to go on road
deltaStrikejj	683877924387160064	2016-01-04T05:09:37	Softykjr forecast high for Minneapolis next sunday is 15 degrees. yikes
deltaStrikejj	683876968861798400	2016-01-04T05:05:49	Early money on Minny ... Vikings opened +7, bet down to +5.5 hosting Seahawks

deltaStrikejj	683808935992623104	2016-01-04T00:35:29	Arizona fans are stunned lol gotta love it. GoHawks
deltaStrikejj	683805865699196928	2016-01-04T00:23:17	The Seahawks allowed the fewest points in the league for the fourth straight season, the first time that's ever happened in the NFL.
deltaStrikejj	683803848658399232	2016-01-04T00:15:16	Softykjr home game? 
deltaStrikejj	683785608523726848	2016-01-03T23:02:47	And a #1 offense they are stopping 
deltaStrikejj	683782328322142212	2016-01-03T22:49:45	Tyler Lockett is in full Devin Hester mode right now.
deltaStrikejj	683784387297542144	2016-01-03T22:57:56	lalaruza74 what part of playoffs don't u understand. Regular season means nothing if u can get it done in January
deltaStrikejj	683779158405550080	2016-01-03T22:37:10	I like how they keep replaying the penalty like it was the reason Seattle scored. Lockett returned it like 60 yards.
deltaStrikejj	683781230781841409	2016-01-03T22:45:24	Ha if not for Cam I think Russ would be making a case for MVP in this game! 
deltaStrikejj	683781038863069185	2016-01-03T22:44:38	How about them Seahawks?! On a mission. 3 straight Super Bowls a real possibility..
deltaStrikejj	683780699900358657	2016-01-03T22:43:17	lalaruza74 lol you're team is getting toasted at home dude. Maybe you should open ur eyes
deltaStrikejj	683780012927889408	2016-01-03T22:40:33	darjohn25 lol thanks you're right that was a weak call but still dominating 1st half.
deltaStrikejj	683779712011771905	2016-01-03T22:39:22	Arizona been overrated all year. Playoff time is when it matters..showing their inexperience in January..
deltaStrikejj	683778637485584384	2016-01-03T22:35:05	Hell of return by Tyler Lockett! Let's go Hawks!
deltaStrikejj	683777678210535425	2016-01-03T22:31:17	Should've been another Carson Palmer INT there! Hawks D looking decent without Bam Bam Kam
deltaStrikejj	683775100923936772	2016-01-03T22:21:02	Doug Baldwin earns another $150,000 in incentives with his 75th catch of the season. This brings his incentive total to $725,000.
deltaStrikejj	683738582230564864	2016-01-03T19:55:55	Kam Chancellor and Russell Okung among Seattle's inactives today.
deltaStrikejj	683723552269312000	2016-01-03T18:56:12	How the heck was Dallas a 3 point favorite in this game?
deltaStrikejj	683452755395018752	2016-01-03T01:00:09	OptionsHawk ha sweet. Haven't tried that but sounds top notch. Cheers
deltaStrikejj	683452125704097792	2016-01-03T00:57:39	OptionsHawk hope ur pairing that with a nice IPA
deltaStrikejj	682763594757320704	2016-01-01T03:21:40	kaneco501_1 ha thanks man. I hardly post trading ideas anymore but more so overall observations. Glad someone enjoys it. Happy new year
deltaStrikejj	682739058565513216	2016-01-01T01:44:10	Last sunset of the year here in Seattle and it was AWESOME! Bring on 2016! NYE2016

deltaStrikejj	682033890328973312	2015-12-30T03:02:05	Can't wait for Al Jazeera to tell us what Chip Kelly was on when he made all those roster moves
deltaStrikejj	682208985819185152	2015-12-30T14:37:51	Interesting episode   
deltaStrikejj	682035488601985025	2015-12-30T03:08:26	friend of mine who has never bought a stock just asked me this week if he should buy AMZN now.. ugh always a red flag
deltaStrikejj	682035250793299969	2015-12-30T03:07:30	not to say FB wont go to 120 or GOOGL to 1000 but hard to jump  in at this point with both hands and expect much
deltaStrikejj	682034972513841152	2015-12-30T03:06:23	the whole FANG trade seems extremely long in the tooth. if mainstream is naming groups after acronym's its probably nearing 9th inning..
deltaStrikejj	682033507967746048	2015-12-30T03:00:34	secured 2nd place in fantasy league with my buddies. not bad but really could have been better if Odell played..or Big Ben showed up
deltaStrikejj	682031779058823169	2015-12-30T02:53:42	agwarner RyanDetrick yep I'm actually thinking the same, could have nice rebound into '16 just because mean reversion. thx for sharing
deltaStrikejj	682031274563735552	2015-12-30T02:51:42	darjohn25 yea good point. defenses just too good at this level
deltaStrikejj	682030749407526912	2015-12-30T02:49:36	RyanDetrick agwarner nice table. shows how useless an allocation into commodities is. I always view them as trades, not investments.
deltaStrikejj	682024715611803648	2015-12-30T02:25:38	oh my 
deltaStrikejj	682000785387814914	2015-12-30T00:50:32	darjohn25 yea he needs to adapt better! Like most things in life

deltaStrikejj	681274150040674304	2015-12-28T00:43:09	You Cardinals fans sure talk a lot of junk for not winning any playoff games in years.. 
deltaStrikejj	681269058029760512	2015-12-28T00:22:55	lalaruza74 yea just like the cardinals lost to the Rams in October..
deltaStrikejj	681268834267860992	2015-12-28T00:22:02	The refs are just screwing the Hawks in this game wow. So many bad calls
deltaStrikejj	681241016301555712	2015-12-27T22:31:29	What the hell was Richard Sherman doin?
deltaStrikejj	681218066189910016	2015-12-27T21:00:18	agwarner yea figured I'd be ok Big Ben vs Baltimore. Whoops
deltaStrikejj	681217794294165505	2015-12-27T20:59:13	Cam Newton held to 142 passing yards in first loss. Guess that cockiness catches up with everyone eventually..
deltaStrikejj	681212804322361344	2015-12-27T20:39:23	So many 4th downs at once right now across NFL I'm waiting for NYT4thDownBot to blow a fuse or something
