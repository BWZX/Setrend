jayrosen_nyu	715890773435277312	2016-04-01T13:17:15	davidreevely jandrewpotter InklessPW My point was: contests for control are fought out through claims about 'what readers want.'
jayrosen_nyu	715887207656071168	2016-04-01T13:03:05	jandrewpotter InklessPW Would you not say that it was about control fought out through "what readers want?"

jayrosen_nyu	715712091102056448	2016-04-01T01:27:14	timappelo Good example of what I meant. That's an argument about whose knowledge should control, played out through: what do readers want?

jayrosen_nyu	715696055871004672	2016-04-01T00:23:31	InklessPW Who said that? I sure didn't. That is a mendacious summary. Ill-intentioned.
jayrosen_nyu	715683638977888259	2016-03-31T23:34:10	bendwilliams Okay, thanks for the education, Ben.
jayrosen_nyu	715681400960262145	2016-03-31T23:25:17	johncabell No, thank you for asking me what I think.
jayrosen_nyu	715681273583427584	2016-03-31T23:24:46	bendwilliams Okay, got it. But do they know that? Or do they THINK that?
jayrosen_nyu	715679623342923777	2016-03-31T23:18:13	johncabell No. My thesis: contests that are really about control of the product are fought out through propositions re: what readers want.
jayrosen_nyu	715678549185789952	2016-03-31T23:13:57	bendwilliams I agree! Equally deep: "short" may be clueless about what readers really want. But enforcing short can serve other ends.
jayrosen_nyu	715677101886685184	2016-03-31T23:08:12	bendwilliams Maybe we agree. "Long" is not a virtue. In fact, it makes no sense at all. But "short" is not equivalent to what people want.
jayrosen_nyu	715676518706454528	2016-03-31T23:05:53	johncabell Not sure what you mean by subterfuge. That was not a term I used.

jayrosen_nyu	715674819241644032	2016-03-31T22:59:08	bendwilliams There we disagree. I think 'disguised battles for control' puts it well. But you're an editor, I'm not, so... could be wrong.
jayrosen_nyu	715672964671397889	2016-03-31T22:51:45	bendwilliams Okay, eyeroll. But I would add: "Long is better, truer" (which I do not believe) is about writers controlling editors.
jayrosen_nyu	715671675728211970	2016-03-31T22:46:38	dangillmor joeposner Which editors had to enforce by controlling writers.
jayrosen_nyu	715670826767527936	2016-03-31T22:43:16	"Keep it short" was never about demand. It was about control. Editors controlling writers.

jayrosen_nyu	714118228650430464	2016-03-27T15:53:48	erikfroese Noteworthy because the same people would probably say, "it's not our job to raise Trump's negatives."
jayrosen_nyu	714109447925317632	2016-03-27T15:18:54	It's noteworthy to me that political journalists are saying in reply to criticism, "Who do you think made Trump so unpopular? It was us!"
jayrosen_nyu	714102464551718912	2016-03-27T14:51:09	VWPickard I don't think anyone said it was bad apples, just not enough people willing to resist structural incentives or enforce standards.
jayrosen_nyu	714100326111035393	2016-03-27T14:42:39	VWPickard So then why did Chuck Todd say he would resist?

jayrosen_nyu	714093150902599680	2016-03-27T14:14:09	Lot of criticism for letting Trump call in to TV shows. Some feel bad about allowing it. ABC News is defiant. This morning, Trump calls in.
jayrosen_nyu	713960978044608512	2016-03-27T05:28:56	tomcoates I hear you. I do. There's the problem of hits, but there is also the problem of "both sides do it." Equally structural, in a way.
jayrosen_nyu	713959357566869504	2016-03-27T05:22:30	paulythegun So which debate are you perplexed by? "I'm always perplexed by this debate."
jayrosen_nyu	713956642187055104	2016-03-27T05:11:42	paulythegun Which debate are you talking about? By using "this" you left a fatal ambiguity in there.
jayrosen_nyu	713955179876511745	2016-03-27T05:05:54	If you're making — or refuting — the claim that the media gave us Trump, the effect will be to obscure press performance in covering Trump.

jayrosen_nyu	713876874783563776	2016-03-26T23:54:44	AddisonDeNitwit The mark of an unserious attempt to face this Q. is to frame it as 'did the media create'— as against unduly contribute to.
jayrosen_nyu	713874938831175684	2016-03-26T23:47:03	The only thing they suggest is, "we should have listened to the voters more." Otherwise, everything stays the same.

jayrosen_nyu	713849152418004992	2016-03-26T22:04:35	chengela That is a funny shirt.
jayrosen_nyu	713845885487226882	2016-03-26T21:51:36	OliverKamm I wasn't referencing the grammatical concept but the rhetorical one, as the piece says.
jayrosen_nyu	713843843326746625	2016-03-26T21:43:29	pbump That actually happened to me! My dad sent me $40 when I was a grad student at NYU. Note with the check said "every little bit helps."
jayrosen_nyu	713841111815602176	2016-03-26T21:32:38	dporpentine Welcome to mute. It's enjoyable.
jayrosen_nyu	713839813498003456	2016-03-26T21:27:28	dporpentine Not, it's that they understood fully what I meant.
jayrosen_nyu	713839421657845760	2016-03-26T21:25:55	OliverKamm What's funny is: I was trying to avoid the term "passive tense" because the grammarians almost shot my head off for that once.
jayrosen_nyu	713838716335353856	2016-03-26T21:23:07	dporpentine Yes, this has been pointed out to me several times. The grammarians hated it. The only ones who liked it were the readers.
jayrosen_nyu	713836577970069506	2016-03-26T21:14:37	WeCon14 Yes, its mine. I just noticed it from observation, people who cannot paraphrase well "cheat" in other ways too.
jayrosen_nyu	713830175688011777	2016-03-26T20:49:10	WeCon14 It's close-to infallible. There are almost no false negatives.
jayrosen_nyu	713822270964310017	2016-03-26T20:17:46	CharlieHaviland It's amusing. But I knew about this very tendency on Twitter, so I really have no excuse.
jayrosen_nyu	713816477808332800	2016-03-26T19:54:45	dandrezner Okay, but is cementing 1. 2. and 3. in the minds of Washington Post editors and readers doing badly in the Republican primary?
jayrosen_nyu	713815295052406788	2016-03-26T19:50:03	lousylinguist Thanks. I've been informed I was completely wrong by the grammarians and nothing about the sentence was passive at all. :-)
jayrosen_nyu	713814319977381888	2016-03-26T19:46:10	dandrezner Not snarking or savvy-ing you, just curious: when you say his talk with the Post went badly, in what sense was it bad for Trump?
jayrosen_nyu	713793693187235843	2016-03-26T18:24:12	JohnRussell99 Yes, I have been corrected on that.
jayrosen_nyu	713789402460372992	2016-03-26T18:07:09	ebuie Any more corrections?
jayrosen_nyu	713788784119324674	2016-03-26T18:04:42	ebuie I explained what's passive about it in my original tweet. In the sentence as written, people don't shift the conversation, events do.

jayrosen_nyu	713783872924819457	2016-03-26T17:45:11	Notice the passive voice here.  People don't shift the conversation, events do. 
jayrosen_nyu	713780613828972545	2016-03-26T17:32:14	fmanjoo It's bad. Makes me wonder about the editor who accepted it, though.

jayrosen_nyu	713776864641335296	2016-03-26T17:17:20	BiellaColeman Don't have a better one. But I do try to consciously avoid the mental image of "translating" ideas into prose. It ain't that.
jayrosen_nyu	713775575987523584	2016-03-26T17:12:13	BiellaColeman Translating: I try to avoid that term because it doesn't describe what actually happens when it works.

jayrosen_nyu	711382629266759680	2016-03-20T02:43:30	mykfmn Point is not that journalists need to pick sides; it's that they should be reality-based. And "down the middle"-ism prevents that.
jayrosen_nyu	711377503898566656	2016-03-20T02:23:08	mykfmn In the example I wrote about, the  journalist's need to appear neutral is contributing to — and accepting of —  polarization.

jayrosen_nyu	708068643385516032	2016-03-10T23:14:54	palafo Since I comment on the futility of the distinction between horse race and 'position papers,' it's just odd that would rely on that.

jayrosen_nyu	707997539589623808	2016-03-10T18:32:22	ErikWemple In retrospect, "is there any consensus here?" is when the senior editors should have asserted themselves. That's their failure.
jayrosen_nyu	707995138002427904	2016-03-10T18:22:49	ErikWemple YES. The way I'd say it is: she raised a global concern. It was responded to with a textual change, and "is this the consensus?"
jayrosen_nyu	707994705175453697	2016-03-10T18:21:06	ErikWemple 6/ I think if I were Deadspin I'd run the lawyer's letter with commentary, and promise further reporting. But I'm not a lawyer.
jayrosen_nyu	707994148847140866	2016-03-10T18:18:53	ErikWemple 5/ It's pretty clear that this was a team failure, not the "fault" of one editor. Again, voxmediainc's internal review is key.
jayrosen_nyu	707993746739171328	2016-03-10T18:17:17	ErikWemple 4/ I also think Stout's email announcing what a great story they had in hand is friendly to Deadspin's interpretation, but...
jayrosen_nyu	707993025729974273	2016-03-10T18:14:25	ErikWemple 3/ Stout says about Bergeron's complaints not "wow, we have to rethink this," but "is there any consensus here?" (is she alone?)
jayrosen_nyu	707992581813215232	2016-03-10T18:12:40	ErikWemple 2/ The "works for me" email is significant but not dispositive. It complicates the picture. Equally significant to me is when...
jayrosen_nyu	707991898401718272	2016-03-10T18:09:57	ErikWemple 1/ I think the lawyer's letter shows why Vox's internal investigation is important, and why the results should be made public.

jayrosen_nyu	707687122204037120	2016-03-09T21:58:52	A valid point. Three less commented-on reasons for saturation Trump: far more accessible, unscripted, risk-tolerant.

jayrosen_nyu	707593537639092224	2016-03-09T15:47:00	As cshirky points out, the press KNOWS the primary is about amassing delegates, but frames it as if it's about winning states. Why? Sports!

jayrosen_nyu	707580124015828992	2016-03-09T14:53:42	matttullis Reading it now.

jayrosen_nyu	647401086056271872	2015-09-25T13:23:41	The entire commentariat is going to feel a little silly when Marco Rubio wins every Republican primary.
jayrosen_nyu	707358537513607169	2016-03-09T00:13:12	To me, a profound question.  
jayrosen_nyu	707279705934864385	2016-03-08T18:59:57	greensnow This was my original point and remains such.  Also see: 
jayrosen_nyu	707264947080863744	2016-03-08T18:01:18	JoeNBC I said your SHOW is friendly confines for Trump. (And it is...) You responded about your personal friend-ship with Jeb and Kasich.
jayrosen_nyu	707260150722256898	2016-03-08T17:42:14	I'd recommend this argument, Joe: BECAUSE we are friendly confines for Donald, when we get tough with him it stings. 
jayrosen_nyu	707251308013744129	2016-03-08T17:07:06	Sundaynista So you see my point.

jayrosen_nyu	707243441965686788	2016-03-08T16:35:51	HerbScribner I don't have a problem with JoeNBC being the Trump-friendly morning show. But when called that, own up to it. He wouldn't.
jayrosen_nyu	707242984597823489	2016-03-08T16:34:02	I've seen — and endured — a lot of ugly user experiences on newspaper sites. But this takes the crown. 
jayrosen_nyu	707236648384372736	2016-03-08T16:08:51	mike__cunning That's a question for greghoward88.
jayrosen_nyu	707236057876664322	2016-03-08T16:06:30	alexremington No way to evaluate the story without knowing the source. When that right is bargained away, the decision is unreviewable.
jayrosen_nyu	707235500403367937	2016-03-08T16:04:17	HerbScribner I'm in favor of there being a plurality of approaches to Trump by journalists. Make it clear what the approach is. So, yes.
jayrosen_nyu	707234258843209728	2016-03-08T15:59:21	This open letter from two Huff Post journalists to Trump supporters who are not racist  is a complex rhetorical act.
jayrosen_nyu	707231806865727488	2016-03-08T15:49:37	If you missed this yesterday, my new post: “We temporarily lost our minds.” On SBNation Daniel Holtzclaw debacle. 
jayrosen_nyu	707231048212606976	2016-03-08T15:46:36	alexremington Yes, I do. You're comparing unlike things. The public has an inherent right to know the source. Not so of other decisions.
jayrosen_nyu	707081909482987520	2016-03-08T05:53:58	alexremington Okay, Alex.
jayrosen_nyu	707066287940358144	2016-03-08T04:51:54	mopaosarkozy Don't have one yet.
jayrosen_nyu	707065760900882432	2016-03-08T04:49:48	ErikSherman No way for the public to review or have oversight is what I meant.
jayrosen_nyu	707065296255918080	2016-03-08T04:47:57	alexremington I don't know what you're pretending that withholding newsworthy information from the public is like other decision-making.
jayrosen_nyu	707062420716593152	2016-03-08T04:36:32	alexremington There is no way for us to know whether trading away our right to know the source was a good deal or a bad one.
jayrosen_nyu	707060242434150401	2016-03-08T04:27:52	alexremington No. I wouldn't.
jayrosen_nyu	707058931537997824	2016-03-08T04:22:40	About the decision to grant anonymity there's no review, no oversight, no accountability. So what would you expect? 
jayrosen_nyu	707053163359166464	2016-03-08T03:59:45	ftrain Hi, Paul. I wrote about the sbnation Holtzclaw debacle, including your suggestions.

jayrosen_nyu	707042257715785728	2016-03-08T03:16:25	richardSFO It is not ambiguous. I meant MarkHalperin.
jayrosen_nyu	707039992682553346	2016-03-08T03:07:25	What is this man talking about? He sounds unhinged. Do read the piece. There is nothing 'amazing' about it.

jayrosen_nyu	706704907714371584	2016-03-07T04:55:54	CHN_AdamWodon Okay, I understand. As I said, the writer was completely over-matched by this subject. This was way beyond editing problems.
jayrosen_nyu	706701640968093696	2016-03-07T04:42:55	CHN_AdamWodon I didn't gloss over it. I just didn't address it in that form. I addressed it in this form: 
jayrosen_nyu	706700970567319552	2016-03-07T04:40:15	"No one who loves you would have let you publish it on the internet." From my new post.  About Daniel Holtzclaw...
jayrosen_nyu	706696733368131585	2016-03-07T04:23:25	I just published a new post... “We temporarily lost our minds.” My thoughts on SBNation’s Daniel Holtzclaw debacle. 
jayrosen_nyu	706664055763836928	2016-03-07T02:13:34	If a Twitter list you made is COMPLETELY taken over by a single event, for screen upon screen... it's a good list.

jayrosen_nyu	706572999416217600	2016-03-06T20:11:45	ColinMoreshead delong Sulliview I think there might be ways of spotlighting the .001 percent that are more valuable for Times readers.
jayrosen_nyu	706571330041352193	2016-03-06T20:05:07	HumbleRando Sulliview I think it's the homey nickname, as in "take home a four pack" as if this kind of wealth is a lifestyle choice.

jayrosen_nyu	706569463064301568	2016-03-06T19:57:42	I guess they think this is funny. Actually, I don't know what they're thinking with this. Maybe Sulliview does.

jayrosen_nyu	706553924719759360	2016-03-06T18:55:57	I wish more conservatives were as candid. Making it harder to vote leads to a "better" electorate: that's the belief 
jayrosen_nyu	706551072660332544	2016-03-06T18:44:37	Away from the game for a while, journalists get frustrated by the same things that frustrate viewers and readers. 
jayrosen_nyu	706549542238420993	2016-03-06T18:38:32	That's your  "big idea?" I don't think that term means what you think it means, Wash Post.  
jayrosen_nyu	706541675573862405	2016-03-06T18:07:17	johnmcquaid Thanks, John. Amazing, isn't it?
jayrosen_nyu	706531368457662464	2016-03-06T17:26:19	PolSciEconSalsa I don't agree that not being booked on television is continued "punishment." He has a fine and comfortable life.

jayrosen_nyu	706504571401666561	2016-03-06T15:39:50	ClarenceWhorley Oh, wake up. The corruption isn't creating a shadow company. It's a NEWS company agreeing to suppress very big NEWS.

jayrosen_nyu	706295036657475584	2016-03-06T01:47:13	lisawilliams Me too (fascinated.) But it may not be accurate to call GateHouse a newspaper chain any more. It's a financial play, a fund.

jayrosen_nyu	706180279824678914	2016-03-05T18:11:13	gwbstr It's the 'staying away from sensitive topics' part that makes me queasy. Maybe if they gave me a list of those...
jayrosen_nyu	706176214684332032	2016-03-05T17:55:04	jayrosen_nyu mathewi Here reillyadam and I change our minds about off-the-record endorsement meetings: 
jayrosen_nyu	706178531701727236	2016-03-05T18:04:16	dankennedy_nu mathewi reillyadam Thanks, Dan.
jayrosen_nyu	706178277841510402	2016-03-05T18:03:16	davewiner Your question reveals the real reason, I'm afraid. The seduction of "don't you want to know the inside dirt, the 'real story...?"
jayrosen_nyu	706177812839927808	2016-03-05T18:01:25	MattWelch Ha. Shows what I know. Well, you lost eventually so that's all that counts. :-)
jayrosen_nyu	706175674437005312	2016-03-05T17:52:55	MattWelch I'm sure you lost.
jayrosen_nyu	706175543268548608	2016-03-05T17:52:24	mathewi Yeah, I can imagine. But that subtly undermines the idea of newspaper as stand-in for the public.
jayrosen_nyu	706175191337013250	2016-03-05T17:51:00	davewiner Okay. It also creates the possibility of a self gotcha. Learning something that contradicts a public stance that you can't use.
jayrosen_nyu	706173452898734080	2016-03-05T17:44:05	What's the logic of allowing an endorsement interview to go off-the-record?  Do you know? 
jayrosen_nyu	706164311702507520	2016-03-05T17:07:46	As the alternatives to "we couldn't find anyone qualified!" mount....  
jayrosen_nyu	706162000649449473	2016-03-05T16:58:35	morettiphd That's the issue. How does one know?

jayrosen_nyu	705915665434148864	2016-03-05T00:39:44	pkedrosky Right. Add a "strategist" and advisor class that is risk-adverse (so it can work again in future campaigns) and makes more sense.
jayrosen_nyu	705914947591671809	2016-03-05T00:36:53	Pachacutec_ Yep, I think that is a big part of it.
jayrosen_nyu	705907445105823744	2016-03-05T00:07:04	gshevlin reviewjournal I would go with a stronger term than 'hubris.'
jayrosen_nyu	705905560277946368	2016-03-04T23:59:35	gshevlin reviewjournal Billionaire's bubble is the only answer I can come up with. But it wasn't a public company that was bought.
jayrosen_nyu	705903614297055232	2016-03-04T23:51:51	liu226 Correct.
jayrosen_nyu	705902465540030464	2016-03-04T23:47:17	Bingo times ten.  The sheer unpredictability of the thing is 80 percent of it. 
jayrosen_nyu	705900304676552704	2016-03-04T23:38:42	realdcm I would go with a simpler explanation: greed. Revenues pouring in, costs contained. Also: horse race journalism is the standard.
jayrosen_nyu	705899941957341185	2016-03-04T23:37:15	MatthewPerle reviewjournal Yes. It is. But the whole deal shows the excesses of 'bubble thinking.'
jayrosen_nyu	705898427113218048	2016-03-04T23:31:14	The Adelson purchase of reviewjournal was supposed to be forever secret.  As I guessed: 
jayrosen_nyu	705895685422518272	2016-03-04T23:20:20	realdcm I think the networks can be criticized for drafting off the Trump ratings velocity without devoting investigative resources to him.
jayrosen_nyu	705894843025858561	2016-03-04T23:17:00	realdcm There should be more, yes, and I think they will build as his nomination becomes more and more likely. 
jayrosen_nyu	705893643421356036	2016-03-04T23:12:14	realdcm Okay, thanks. 
jayrosen_nyu	705892688562954241	2016-03-04T23:08:26	jackalltogether It's an EXTREMELY politicized term on the right.
jayrosen_nyu	705891309236699136	2016-03-04T23:02:57	realdcm First you tell me: does press scrutiny of a candidate normally increase exponentially once he or she becomes a major party nominee?
jayrosen_nyu	705889481681969154	2016-03-04T22:55:41	Right wing meme I am seeing a lot lately. The press won't "vet" Trump until he wins the nomination, then it will dig in with a vengeance.
jayrosen_nyu	705887416666759169	2016-03-04T22:47:29	Nick_Zen And your point is...?
jayrosen_nyu	705887004479856640	2016-03-04T22:45:51	Journalists have barely scratched the surface of Donald Trump's business career.

jayrosen_nyu	705469059228418048	2016-03-03T19:05:05	I bet the Trump emergency is going to bring a blooming of some great political writing. Adam Gopnik's, for example:

jayrosen_nyu	705450586779623424	2016-03-03T17:51:41	stevebuttry Thx. Just shared.
jayrosen_nyu	705450438867427332	2016-03-03T17:51:05	For me the right Q. is: should reporters conceal their opinions? Are they SURE that's the best way to be trusted? 
jayrosen_nyu	705445244800798720	2016-03-03T17:30:27	stevebuttry If I know where you're coming from YET the account you produce is fair to all sides that could add to credibility even more.
jayrosen_nyu	705444356442951680	2016-03-03T17:26:55	stevebuttry Being open about your opinions and producing fair and neutral accounts are not mutually exclusive. Post should reflect that.
jayrosen_nyu	705438245547593728	2016-03-03T17:02:38	BrianLehrer I knew the first part. Not the second.
jayrosen_nyu	705416924663050240	2016-03-03T15:37:55	MisterBossy I just said it fit the genre. The rest is you.

jayrosen_nyu	705411989007441920	2016-03-03T15:18:18	incredulist Exactly.
jayrosen_nyu	705411628083314688	2016-03-03T15:16:52	johnmcquaid It's more the premise: access to the plane will reveal what access to one's TV won't. The little picture has in it the big one.
jayrosen_nyu	705409561100984320	2016-03-03T15:08:39	Genre requirements! Every 'reporter rides in Trump plane' story needs an incident like this.  
jayrosen_nyu	705408178788425728	2016-03-03T15:03:10	JesseHolcomb Studio20NYU Thanks, Jesse. There's some Pew references in there!
jayrosen_nyu	705406220061057024	2016-03-03T14:55:23	'The rise of American authoritarianism.'  Long, difficult, different— and worth it. Vox tries to explain Trump.
jayrosen_nyu	705405084365168641	2016-03-03T14:50:52	Attention, Studio20NYU. Thanks, Meredith! My grad students did the research, built the site. I was their editor.  
jayrosen_nyu	705244390097293312	2016-03-03T04:12:20	Mad_Science_Guy And I'm just summarizing what jackshafer said.
jayrosen_nyu	705239243740876800	2016-03-03T03:51:53	That Trump is a creation of the media is an absurd claim, says jackshafer Absurd and wrong.  
jayrosen_nyu	705226088251858950	2016-03-03T02:59:36	Like a half-eaten bucket of popcorn left on the theatre floor. 
jayrosen_nyu	705205036171796480	2016-03-03T01:35:57	Because that's what builds trust. The mask. 
jayrosen_nyu	705144684935520256	2016-03-02T21:36:08	Would love to play but I have 14 million radio listeners depending on me. Have fun with your 20,000 Twitter follows 
jayrosen_nyu	705173672747798528	2016-03-02T23:31:19	For me the funniest thing about the "stop Trump" articles (more are coming!) is when they get to the remedy: rich people paying for TV ads.
jayrosen_nyu	705171694357499904	2016-03-02T23:23:28	My own view: all the Twitter chatter on Christie's 'hostage tape' performance last night was misplaced and wrong. 
jayrosen_nyu	705169558513000449	2016-03-02T23:14:58	TheCableGame That's what I was looking for. Thanks.
jayrosen_nyu	705168392056119296	2016-03-02T23:10:20	TheCableGame So Fox News couldn't be a political organization that does news because Ailes led CNBC? I don't understand.
jayrosen_nyu	705166279230038016	2016-03-02T23:01:56	TheCableGame It's not a pre-conception. It's a POST-conception. But how would you characterize it, keeping Rogeer Ailes background in mind?
jayrosen_nyu	705165118196285441	2016-03-02T22:57:20	I love how gabrielsherman reports on Fox under the premise that it's a political organization that does news. 
jayrosen_nyu	705160899871547392	2016-03-02T22:40:34	Cover image of a site my studio20nyu students launched Tuesday.  Crash course in what's new. 
jayrosen_nyu	705158621961785344	2016-03-02T22:31:31	THAToneil JamesGleick Sulliview When NYT decides reader trust is more important than competition with peer newsrooms, policy will change.
jayrosen_nyu	705152692709097472	2016-03-02T22:07:57	Well, the policy has been to have a "policy" that is routinely violated, raising the question: which is the policy? 
jayrosen_nyu	705145292958670849	2016-03-02T21:38:33	skippychmiel I don't normally use this expression but it seems to me the arrangement of Time covers speaks for itself.
jayrosen_nyu	705143884003811328	2016-03-02T21:32:57	skippychmiel Sometimes the best way to engage people is to just present the artifact. If someone says, "but that IS a comment...' I agree.
jayrosen_nyu	705137398670364672	2016-03-02T21:07:11	jeremyzilar Okay. But it's possible that inventing saviors is not a good answer to that problem.
jayrosen_nyu	705135562592808961	2016-03-02T20:59:53	Presented without comment.  
jayrosen_nyu	705096431011495936	2016-03-02T18:24:23	A student of technology and the business of tech explains why the GOP is cratering.  Good. 
jayrosen_nyu	705093342338662400	2016-03-02T18:12:07	Rieva So a kind of void, then. A useful void.

jayrosen_nyu	705085966483111936	2016-03-02T17:42:48	Fabulous tale of Fox News getting punked by an on-air expert who claimed to be ex-CIA and (probably) made it all up. 
jayrosen_nyu	705085319968854016	2016-03-02T17:40:14	MinnowSF Thanks, Amy.
jayrosen_nyu	705077055503863809	2016-03-02T17:07:24	gregminton That's like someone who is famous for being well-known.
jayrosen_nyu	705075226535657472	2016-03-02T17:00:08	Depth of knowledge? Missing. Distinct POV? None. Audience trust? C'mon. So what does Brian Williams add to MSNBC's live coverage: Any idea?
jayrosen_nyu	705058090958385152	2016-03-02T15:52:02	JohnJHarwood froomkin Right. Not saying it doesn't make sense. It does. Still...
jayrosen_nyu	705057243688001536	2016-03-02T15:48:40	In the Post's framing of last night results, the protagonist is the Republican establishment. Not Trump. Or voters. 
jayrosen_nyu	705046280658096128	2016-03-02T15:05:07	Teachers! Especially J-school. My grad students studio20NYU made this for you.  Intro to what's changing journalism.
jayrosen_nyu	704889166694375424	2016-03-02T04:40:48	mightymemo I've never understood why she is on. I can identify no expertise or perspective or any special broadcast talent. Can anyone?
jayrosen_nyu	704806661383458816	2016-03-01T23:12:57	Nerdland was a platform for diverse, brilliant voices to weigh in on politics — the only place on MSNBC &amp; cable 
jayrosen_nyu	704886558827085825	2016-03-02T04:30:26	_silversmith No. It's not. They want him on air. They would pay him whether he was on the air or not.
jayrosen_nyu	704885392890318848	2016-03-02T04:25:48	_silversmith Again, they decided they had to pay him, not use him on air. They chose to use him. But not because of contracts.
jayrosen_nyu	704884154773741568	2016-03-02T04:20:53	_silversmith No. They may feel contractually bound to pay him or face a lawsuit more costly than his pay. But not to put him on air.
jayrosen_nyu	704882884092567552	2016-03-02T04:15:50	_silversmith He does not have a contract that requires him to be on air. Nowhere near that much power.
jayrosen_nyu	704881630272471041	2016-03-02T04:10:51	In watching journalists and pundits on live TV I divide them into two groups: I understand why they're on, I don't. Brian Williams: don't.
jayrosen_nyu	704810357437636608	2016-03-01T23:27:38	AlanLevinovitz that's it's impossible doesn't mean journalists won't just go ahead assuming it can be done...
jayrosen_nyu	704806944888983552	2016-03-01T23:14:04	RonRosenbaum1 Sure, that's a big factor too. But the press never rose to the challenge of asymmetry between the parties.
jayrosen_nyu	704804064245227521	2016-03-01T23:02:38	For me it's how years and years of false balance, "leave it there" and the both-sides-do-it reflex led up to this. 
jayrosen_nyu	704802159867596800	2016-03-01T22:55:04	Colony14 I guess you didn't like my questions so you decided to answer some other one. By the way, what question was it you were answering?
jayrosen_nyu	704779304375296000	2016-03-01T21:24:14	andrewmendelson Thanks, Andrew. Much appreciated. Studio20NYU Hopefully we will be back next year with News Literacy 2017.

jayrosen_nyu	704746920955277312	2016-03-01T19:15:34	Colony14 Who said the photographer did nothing wrong?  And what does that have to do with the prediction?
jayrosen_nyu	704739487503523842	2016-03-01T18:46:01	kathlanpher Exactly, Katherine. ajam was a case of product differentiation malpractice.
jayrosen_nyu	704738482263031813	2016-03-01T18:42:02	So MSNBC is going generic and balanced because that's how you stand out in a crowded information eviron— hold on. I have to check something.
jayrosen_nyu	704735470140395520	2016-03-01T18:30:04	Carpophores This logic stuff sounds important. You've convinced me to look into it. Cheers!
jayrosen_nyu	704734355705491456	2016-03-01T18:25:38	Carpophores So it's all about "logic," then. Okay, got it. I will have to study up on my logic with these pointers. Thanks.
jayrosen_nyu	704733716166393856	2016-03-01T18:23:05	Carpophores It's not my hypothesis. I didn't write it. You know, different person and all... I shared a link to it.
jayrosen_nyu	704733455767248896	2016-03-01T18:22:03	Carpophores So you don't know if the GOP tried to do that?
jayrosen_nyu	704732658887237633	2016-03-01T18:18:53	Carpophores I understand that nothing so social has a single cause. So did the GOP try to destroy trust in the press and experts? Or not?
jayrosen_nyu	704731714589999105	2016-03-01T18:15:08	If you're following the split between MHarrisPerry and msnbc, this is necessary reading:  By the Post's ErikWemple
jayrosen_nyu	704730984722341888	2016-03-01T18:12:14	Carpophores Okay. Well, thanks for the course in logic. So in your view the GOP HASN'T tried to destroy trust in the press and experts?
jayrosen_nyu	704726210144817152	2016-03-01T17:53:16	Carpophores So... the GOP HASN'T tried to destroy trust in the press and experts? And this is a problem in "logic?" Why not just disagree?

jayrosen_nyu	704453369331634180	2016-02-29T23:49:06	hpygoluki "Violence happens everywhere." Got it. Thanks!
jayrosen_nyu	704452287666765825	2016-02-29T23:44:48	hpygoluki So which is it? You're not worried that violence will erupt at a Trump rally. Or if it happens they will deserve it.

jayrosen_nyu	692824112054583296	2016-01-28T21:38:35	dooglives I'd urge you to keep in mind that in political journalism the term "pragmatism" has almost no referent. It's a cipher, a crutch.
jayrosen_nyu	692823014145134592	2016-01-28T21:34:13	dooglives Sure, that's possible. That's why this ad is so important.

jayrosen_nyu	692822461180674048	2016-01-28T21:32:01	dooglives If the why? is about press behavior, answer is a dysfunctional and neurotic relationship with Clinton not easily summarized. But—
jayrosen_nyu	692820867726860288	2016-01-28T21:25:41	dooglives Yes, there's an assumption she can get done the sort of things Obama could get done AFTER bipartisanship was shown to be a joke.
jayrosen_nyu	692817226605412352	2016-01-28T21:11:13	dooglives jbouie That's because she isn't saying anything that's all that different from what Obama said he was trying to do. Sanders is.
jayrosen_nyu	692814750980444160	2016-01-28T21:01:23	dooglives As jbouie says, there is nothing in Clinton's approach to suggest she can get more done than Obama. You're reading past that.
jayrosen_nyu	692807844501065728	2016-01-28T20:33:56	dooglives Read the piece. I hope you don't take that as an insult. Some do.

jayrosen_nyu	683753164860977153	2016-01-03T20:53:52	FreeBeeCee I have not, but I can imagine how it's used.
jayrosen_nyu	683751757516828672	2016-01-03T20:48:17	RunGomez NiemanLab Didn't I just say that?
jayrosen_nyu	683750544893165568	2016-01-03T20:43:28	I didn't participate in NiemanLab's 2016 predictions (or 2015, 2014...) because I am chicken. And I have no idea what's going to happen.
jayrosen_nyu	683722802420183041	2016-01-03T18:53:13	sudeepLA She's trying to say that. No one believes it. Even her. It's the doctrine of infallibility applied to candidates.
jayrosen_nyu	683704174115160065	2016-01-03T17:39:12	LesZaitz Thanks. I wish you would have included in your post a simple paragraph that explains: why do we need armed militias?
jayrosen_nyu	683701722682896385	2016-01-03T17:29:27	sporobolus dankennedy_nu I thought that was illegal, reducing pay like that.
jayrosen_nyu	683696136201310208	2016-01-03T17:07:15	pregulski Thanks, Phil. I had missed that. Makes it even more amazing.
jayrosen_nyu	683695973516865536	2016-01-03T17:06:37	The people of Iowa understood this tongue-in-cheek Rose Bowl tweet, says Fiorina.  Uh-huh. 
jayrosen_nyu	683689919177461760	2016-01-03T16:42:33	As many have said, this is an amazingly obscure headline for an armed takeover. The latest:  
jayrosen_nyu	683682531762376704	2016-01-03T16:13:12	jeffjarvis Well, Politifact is fact-checking Meet the Press now, so maybe this will come up. 
jayrosen_nyu	683520741602639872	2016-01-03T05:30:18	grinsfelder Just reading his time line now.
jayrosen_nyu	683518084490117120	2016-01-03T05:19:45	NickBaumann I'm saying that shows how fictional the media is to them.
jayrosen_nyu	683515529118789632	2016-01-03T05:09:35	NickBaumann Has anyone who ever said that been grateful or relieved to hear... we are working on it or we did cover it?
jayrosen_nyu	683514117890650112	2016-01-03T05:03:59	Thing is, the term "the media" in that sentence is fictional. It's a reference without a referent. 
jayrosen_nyu	683471194344013824	2016-01-03T02:13:25	markabender JamesFallows The tweet was sent before that, so no.
jayrosen_nyu	683431642833285121	2016-01-02T23:36:15	Boston Globe has been having delivery problems. Its reporters offered to pitch in to get the Sunday paper to homes. 
jayrosen_nyu	683421998337376257	2016-01-02T22:57:56	dankennedy_nu  Anyone reported on it? mysteriousrook
jayrosen_nyu	683419727075643393	2016-01-02T22:48:54	Why is the Boston Globe having such trouble delivering print papers to subscribers? Isn't that a problem society had solved? dankennedy_nu
jayrosen_nyu	683418963640987649	2016-01-02T22:45:52	jason_pontin People get mad when you link to a Facebook post. I'm planning a re-design of my blog that will solve this problem.
jayrosen_nyu	683414138106806272	2016-01-02T22:26:42	dougsheridan I'm sorry, I don't understand your question.
jayrosen_nyu	683409666538364928	2016-01-02T22:08:56	MarshallLocke Thanks. Often I share the link first so people can read what I read, then I think about it.
jayrosen_nyu	683408525419233280	2016-01-02T22:04:24	Will_Bunch Yep. For my money the story right now is GateHouse and Schroeder, and their dealings with Adelson.
jayrosen_nyu	683407915542261762	2016-01-02T22:01:58	MarshallLocke I mean to suggest: that is the headline the nytimes put on its story. I also meant to suggest: links are there for a reason.
jayrosen_nyu	683406422898507778	2016-01-02T21:56:02	New from the New York Times: Sheldon Adelson’s Purchase of Las Vegas Paper Seen as a Power Play. 
jayrosen_nyu	683387417752125440	2016-01-02T20:40:31	gtiso Worried? No. Interested in, but not worried about.
jayrosen_nyu	683386565863862273	2016-01-02T20:37:08	sudeepLA Right.
jayrosen_nyu	683384017010450432	2016-01-02T20:27:00	BrentNYT Yeah, that's the biggie.
jayrosen_nyu	683382065203679232	2016-01-02T20:19:15	morettiphd But of course. Original here: 
jayrosen_nyu	683381323382276096	2016-01-02T20:16:18	JamesFallows It's been an education for me.
jayrosen_nyu	683380762989690880	2016-01-02T20:14:05	overlanderpark Revealing, not important. I am sure you understand the difference.
jayrosen_nyu	683380249829183489	2016-01-02T20:12:02	staphwriter I like that one.
jayrosen_nyu	683377327540146176	2016-01-02T20:00:26	The layers of stupid in Carly Fiorina's Rose Bowl tweet yesterday, which is still up.  
jayrosen_nyu	683338449580093441	2016-01-02T17:25:56	hawkyankee No. Mendacity + stupidity = toxic leadership.

jayrosen_nyu	683335739493486592	2016-01-02T17:15:10	jayrosen_nyu adamsteinbaugh Happened in Thailand three times this past fall. Here's one of those times. 
jayrosen_nyu	683335094921228288	2016-01-02T17:12:37	daniel_platt I suppose anything is possible, but I doubt that very much.
jayrosen_nyu	683334624228061184	2016-01-02T17:10:44	Here's more on that New York Times article that was removed by the printer in Pakistan.  Hat tip, adamsteinbaugh
jayrosen_nyu	683334266634264576	2016-01-02T17:09:19	Kwesi_Booker No, you piss off ALL the fans because Iowa rooters know it's fake allegiance. That's why I want to know more.
jayrosen_nyu	683333169563725825	2016-01-02T17:04:57	I'd love to know more about how this 'layers and layers of stupid' tweet made it online.  
jayrosen_nyu	683331610423484416	2016-01-02T16:58:46	adamsteinbaugh Do you know that was the article that was to run in Pakistan, Adam, or are you surmising?
jayrosen_nyu	683328263603761153	2016-01-02T16:45:28	Freedom of the press belongs to those who run one. Times printer in Pakistan removes an article. Via salmanmasood 
jayrosen_nyu	683125750296371200	2016-01-02T03:20:45	gillespie2400 Who are you talking to? I don't support either one.
jayrosen_nyu	683060856201023488	2016-01-01T23:02:53	For TheFix blog this is like a four alarm fire: Carly Fiorina just took political pandering to a whole new level. 
jayrosen_nyu	683058423525707777	2016-01-01T22:53:13	delong No, it's 'Hawkeyes.' Buckeyes is Ohio State.

jayrosen_nyu	683044766083330048	2016-01-01T21:58:57	ernietedeschi It just keeps talking, the longer you think about it.
jayrosen_nyu	683042856995581953	2016-01-01T21:51:22	On so many levels, my favorite tweet of this "cycle," as the political professionals put it.  
jayrosen_nyu	683005122272727040	2016-01-01T19:21:25	annlrandall The interest that non-journalists have in this story is... encouraging.
jayrosen_nyu	683003669873311748	2016-01-01T19:15:39	annlrandall Thanks, Ann. Much appreciated.
jayrosen_nyu	682998166287970304	2016-01-01T18:53:46	Jeb and Hillary are co-winners of TheFix's Worst Year in Washington award. Watching him try to explain that is fun. 
jayrosen_nyu	682979898449883136	2016-01-01T17:41:11	petersterne mattdpearce My favorite :"that was the LA Times that was" passage: dead fish.  
jayrosen_nyu	682971682135486464	2016-01-01T17:08:32	Via jimbrady and jeffjarvis: This is brilliant on page bloat, web design and the ad tech bubble. 
jayrosen_nyu	682967854182993920	2016-01-01T16:53:20	If Soros concealed his ownership, if the newsroom was told to investigate a judge hearing a Soros case— yeah, story.

jayrosen_nyu	682948284613279744	2016-01-01T15:35:34	Catholic journalists: you are now doctrinally forbidden to practice "false neutrality."  My source: the Pope.
jayrosen_nyu	682748682928828416	2016-01-01T02:22:25	taylorpeck Seems to have been a significant failure by tech journalism, but since so many participated... Anyway: 
jayrosen_nyu	682748249015480320	2016-01-01T02:20:42	cityatlas Right, who does? 
jayrosen_nyu	682716837700866049	2016-01-01T00:15:53	robogreen Thanks, Robert. Much appreciated. For predicting 2016: who knows? I have enough trouble understanding the present.
jayrosen_nyu	682707430703259648	2015-12-31T23:38:30	dartdog JamesGleick I'm sorry, I didn't understand a word of that. Must be a reply to another post.
jayrosen_nyu	682705714561855489	2015-12-31T23:31:41	tvoti bejugo That's what I thought. Thanks, Auld!
jayrosen_nyu	682703368851210240	2015-12-31T23:22:21	JamesGleick Can't disagree with that. The question is whether it would be wise to have some other priorities in the mix, like news.
jayrosen_nyu	682696012113285122	2015-12-31T22:53:07	Does Facebook have a responsibility to keep us informed? Or if not that, a self-interest?  
jayrosen_nyu	682691107675893760	2015-12-31T22:33:38	By me: The Adelson forces buy a newspaper, journalists fight back.  Timeline and explainer of what the fuss is about.
jayrosen_nyu	682689806556594176	2015-12-31T22:28:28	bejugo Don't know. Maybe tvoti does.

jayrosen_nyu	682621588198539264	2015-12-31T17:57:23	normative mlcalderone Exactly. Hiatt is within his rights to kill the column, but he could explain his reasons and take the heat.
jayrosen_nyu	682620776281976832	2015-12-31T17:54:10	mlcalderone The way Hiatt did it suggests he wanted Meyerson's platform removed, not that he reluctantly parted with a valued contributor.
jayrosen_nyu	682616248098660352	2015-12-31T17:36:10	mlcalderone Hiatt could have let the author know he would have to step it up on social and offered help to HaroldMeyerson in doing that.
