Neuro_Skeptic	705531490273259520	2016-03-03T23:13:10	Pete_Bloomfield there have been a few, here's the main one 
Neuro_Skeptic	705524663267565568	2016-03-03T22:46:02	aina_puce PLOSONE some people have raised that possibility, it's not clear yet AFAIK
Neuro_Skeptic	705524583881973763	2016-03-03T22:45:43	theExtendedLuke sampendu well, the standard of English in the paper is generally extremely good.
Neuro_Skeptic	705523155100672001	2016-03-03T22:40:02	sampendu I'm not sure if journal has said they will invite a resubmit. The authors say that it was translation although some are skeptical
Neuro_Skeptic	705516391970050050	2016-03-03T22:13:10	Bashir9ist there are others, but that's the main one. but it's not just that word, also "mystery" "design" "invention" etc.
Neuro_Skeptic	705514695978000385	2016-03-03T22:06:26	CWDGH the gate is praise of PLOSONE - people take this seriously because they had high expectations. A crap journal wouldn't get a gate
Neuro_Skeptic	705514405690265601	2016-03-03T22:05:16	Bashir9ist Yes, but not everyone is convinced by that claim (see the other comments)
Neuro_Skeptic	705511438845132804	2016-03-03T21:53:29	Bashir9ist maybe an error of wording or maybe that was the intended meaning, but either way the end result was not scientific.
Neuro_Skeptic	705510633995935744	2016-03-03T21:50:17	Bashir9ist No, but in this case the error was gratuitous. Not something that occurs in the normal process of imperfect science
Neuro_Skeptic	705510378474700800	2016-03-03T21:49:16	Bashir9ist true, it should not have been accepted. but that wasn't their decision, it was reviewers / editors.
Neuro_Skeptic	705510192335745026	2016-03-03T21:48:32	Bashir9ist why do I feel for them? because they did nothing wrong: they didn't publish that paper. They just submitted it for consideration
Neuro_Skeptic	705509685693177856	2016-03-03T21:46:31	2/2 The authors acted in good faith (no pun.) So if I were PLOSONE I would invite them to resubmit a rewrite of the paper. Creatorgate
Neuro_Skeptic	705508858618372096	2016-03-03T21:43:14	While PLOSONE are right to retract Creatorgate paper, I feel for the authors. Their paper is no worse now than it was when accepted. 1/2

Neuro_Skeptic	705423449859211265	2016-03-03T16:03:51	joshualord2700 PLOSONE I think the political damage will be small since the authors have now said it was not intended as creationist text
Neuro_Skeptic	705423225166102528	2016-03-03T16:02:57	mbeisen PLOSONE The error itself is small in the grand scheme, but I think people are going to judge PLOS on their response to the issue
Neuro_Skeptic	705395284386443264	2016-03-03T14:11:56	drchriscole Prof_GD_Foster the fact that this paper got published in that form, while yours didn't, would feel like a slap in the face

Neuro_Skeptic	705394593576128512	2016-03-03T14:09:11	JFBonnefon Right. But at the time I remember many people said it made PLoS ONE look bad. But we moved on, hopefully will happen again.
Neuro_Skeptic	705375988176318464	2016-03-03T12:55:15	WoodinRivers It's a good idea, but that doesn't seem to explain "the mystery of the Creator’s invention."
Neuro_Skeptic	705375327523053569	2016-03-03T12:52:37	JFBonnefon I hope not. I'm confident PLOSONE will address this appropriately. Who now remembers Quilt Plots-gate? 
Neuro_Skeptic	705371958955929600	2016-03-03T12:39:14	Bijbelschepping PLOSONE it's only about the "design" in a loose sense of that word. The study says nothing about if/how it was "designed"
Neuro_Skeptic	705350520765095936	2016-03-03T11:14:03	Ambient_Malice PLOSONE that scientists are vigilant.
Neuro_Skeptic	705350485650309120	2016-03-03T11:13:55	Ambient_Malice  that's how predatory OA journals survive. Now PLOSONE is very far from being one of those journals but it is good
Neuro_Skeptic	705350313897758720	2016-03-03T11:13:14	Ambient_Malice PLOSONE on the contrary, people who agree to edit &amp; review for journals with no consideration for the quality are a threat.
Neuro_Skeptic	705349900142309376	2016-03-03T11:11:35	Don_lyall PLOSONE Maybe, I agree it's possible, but "The origins of human hand remain unclear"? Sounds agnostic on evolution at least
Neuro_Skeptic	705349510726361088	2016-03-03T11:10:02	Ambient_Malice PLOSONE Let's not boo-hoo over the boo-hooing, caring about quality is not a vice.
Neuro_Skeptic	705343432752021504	2016-03-03T10:45:53	Don_lyall PLOSONE maybe they should retract, refund author fees and invite them to resubmit a revised version (with a different editor)
Neuro_Skeptic	705343155126865920	2016-03-03T10:44:47	Don_lyall PLOSONE I think retraction is likely at this point. But rather unfair on the authors as they submitted in good faith (no pun)
