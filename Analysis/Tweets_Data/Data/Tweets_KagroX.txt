KagroX	722503310528421893	2016-04-19T19:13:07	SenatorSerrano Saw you cosponsored a bill to cut party enrollment window to 90 days. Do you prefer less, or is 90 what you think is right?

KagroX	722496005778894848	2016-04-19T18:44:05	AndyKirn It may be. I'm asking the bill's sponsor. I'm curious what a D/WFP senator says about such an objection.

KagroX	722495131929165824	2016-04-19T18:40:37	LizKrueger Hi. I saw that you have a bill to reduce NY's party enrollment lead time to 90 days. What do you say to those who prefer less?
KagroX	722494527194447872	2016-04-19T18:38:13	And she's on Twitter, so I guess I'll go ask her.
KagroX	722494440754044929	2016-04-19T18:37:52	So the next question is, why does a D/WP state senator still want 90 days lead time for changing party enrollment?
KagroX	722494205189349376	2016-04-19T18:36:56	Sponsor of NY senate bill to shrink party enrollment deadline to 90 days is both Clinton endorser and elected on D, WP fusion line.

KagroX	722490693990629376	2016-04-19T18:22:59	Sponsor of a bill in the NY state senate to cut the party enrollment lead time in half is a Clinton endorser. Sort of interesting, I guess.

KagroX	719245289480060928	2016-04-10T19:26:54	How do you get on a ballot? Petitions. How do you fill out a petition? Organize people. How do you organize people?

KagroX	719243311400165377	2016-04-10T19:19:02	True. But they leave their doors open for you to join them &amp; change things, even though mostly, people just don't. 
KagroX	719241984016158720	2016-04-10T19:13:46	Yes, but that's why it has to be made. Ppl are standing there invoking wrong "democracy" &amp; wondering what's wrong. 
KagroX	719241606105329666	2016-04-10T19:12:16	Primaries and nominations run on democratic principles. But they're not truly a part of our governing democracy. Different systems.
KagroX	719240982542356480	2016-04-10T19:09:47	I think we'd be a lot clearer about things when people complain about a lack of "democracy" in the primary system if we knew it wasn't one.
KagroX	719240755081015296	2016-04-10T19:08:53	Principalaz AZDemParty Well, that wouldn't be the idea, of course. But taxpayer $ shd be for public functions. Never really true, though.
KagroX	719239764474466305	2016-04-10T19:04:57	One problem with eliminating that taxpayer financing, though, is that the money will come from somewhere else, and we won't like it.
KagroX	719239488317341696	2016-04-10T19:03:51	And that should perhaps include eliminating taxpayer financing of that system, including primary "elections" and national conventions.
KagroX	719239214886436865	2016-04-10T19:02:46	We could &amp; should be doing more to remind people that primaries &amp; conventions are participation in private political clubs, not elections.
KagroX	719206325045956610	2016-04-10T16:52:04	jsperkins67 Probably true. And "corruption" is rarely the reason it's so.

KagroX	719187714868838400	2016-04-10T15:38:07	Trump views navigating nomination process like navigating building code on projects. "I paid for the land, so shut up &amp; get out of my way."

KagroX	716775246825652224	2016-04-03T23:51:50	disastermouse I mean, what would you call the forces arrayed against Senate rules reform?
KagroX	716775008383541248	2016-04-03T23:50:53	disastermouse I haven't faced the same barrier he faces, or you do. But I've faced some pretty serious institutional consensus &amp; beat it.
KagroX	716774759585808384	2016-04-03T23:49:54	disastermouse OK. There's certainly nothing about that that makes me want to change any of my answers.
KagroX	716773976702234625	2016-04-03T23:46:47	disastermouse Well, I've got to tell you, that your argument sounds pretty circular to me. I don't think they're insurmountable.

KagroX	714431571919380480	2016-03-28T12:38:54	iangphillips Sad, since caucuses can teach you so much about where superdelegates really come from &amp; how to be one eventually.
KagroX	714325479013138432	2016-03-28T05:37:20	DOmidvar I wouldn't necessarily oppose your suggestion. But there will be real &amp; serious obstacles to consider at every step.
KagroX	714324887150714880	2016-03-28T05:34:59	DOmidvar The art is making it happen, beyond "ought to." That often requires compromise &amp; imperfection. Superdelegates were once a reform!
KagroX	714323505324621824	2016-03-28T05:29:29	DOmidvar It's not necessarily an automatic non-starter, but it's very close!
KagroX	714323205801029632	2016-03-28T05:28:18	DOmidvar You'd have to get 50 state governments to agree to paying the additional expense, but for one party's partisan exercise.
KagroX	714317841542021120	2016-03-28T05:06:59	DOmidvar It's not the country's money, it's the party's. Do you donate a lot of that, or is someone else paying for your plan?
KagroX	714317451283054593	2016-03-28T05:05:26	DOmidvar Maybe. Right now we have one vote yes, one vote no, for spending more of other people's money.
KagroX	714303300506558465	2016-03-28T04:09:12	You did it! You're a superdelegate! 
KagroX	714302657712656386	2016-03-28T04:06:39	DOmidvar And why the top two? Clearly there's someone else out there popular enough that people were willing to risk deadlock.
KagroX	714302307740041217	2016-03-28T04:05:15	DOmidvar OMG the expense! Ten votes for that one.
KagroX	714301385924337664	2016-03-28T04:01:36	DOmidvar But right now they WISH they had it! So, change the rules. OK. I don't mind. To what? And who'll vote for it?
KagroX	714300558937436161	2016-03-28T03:58:18	SnarkyBits EricJafMN They DID shit their pants. That's why we have this!
KagroX	714300410366918656	2016-03-28T03:57:43	DOmidvar It's always not a problem, until one day, it is. So you have a system in place for it. If you change your mind, change the rules.
KagroX	714299717556023298	2016-03-28T03:54:58	DOmidvar That's because it's never been done. Why do you think that is?
KagroX	714299568507084800	2016-03-28T03:54:22	DOmidvar It's 15%. And more than half of them are DNC members responsible for their election directly to the party rank &amp; file.
KagroX	714298950627405824	2016-03-28T03:51:55	DOmidvar And they'll have to be so sure they're doing the right thing that they'd be willing to bet their elected office on it.
KagroX	714298819916095489	2016-03-28T03:51:24	DOmidvar They can ONLY coalesce in that way and have it mean anything IF the rank &amp; file hand them something so very close.
KagroX	714297566398013440	2016-03-28T03:46:25	EricJafMN There are certainly alternative systems. All you have to do now is get everyone at the DNC to vote themselves out of it.
KagroX	714294450550235136	2016-03-28T03:34:02	It's a system. But there's other business done at convention that requires delegates. Boring stuff! 
KagroX	714293327642779648	2016-03-28T03:29:34	But it will be one the voters handed them. 
KagroX	714292395634851840	2016-03-28T03:25:52	I acknowledge their existence. Nine of them. The others listed later are ex officio superdelegates, regardless. 
KagroX	714291979962556417	2016-03-28T03:24:13	That's 1!  So far, I win! 
KagroX	714291785485393921	2016-03-28T03:23:27	PaulHRosenberg Luckily, they're fungible.
KagroX	714291627297214465	2016-03-28T03:22:49	Plenty of Deanbots used to think the world was against them, and the rules were rigged. Now, they're superdelegates.
KagroX	714291350368157697	2016-03-28T03:21:43	And now, for the most part, they don't.  Magic? No. Reading, organizing and work.  Are we done? No. 
KagroX	714290934838648832	2016-03-28T03:20:04	If you're wondering why I would subject myself to this, it's because Deanbots used to have the same problem. 
KagroX	714290818174099456	2016-03-28T03:19:36	A near-tie is one emergency, and the DNC decides who gets to decide it. Right now, that's superdelegates. 
KagroX	714290427831197697	2016-03-28T03:18:03	armandodkos That, and the habit of the rank &amp; file for clearly expressing its preference, is probably why it never happens.
KagroX	714289913781420032	2016-03-28T03:16:00	At least one of those countries has a pretty good, low-tech anti-voter fraud mechanism. I like that purple dye! 
KagroX	714289672579584001	2016-03-28T03:15:03	You do understand it. Give them power to reach a clear decision in case of emergency, but avoid emergencies. 
KagroX	714289419268657153	2016-03-28T03:14:03	The solution is as democratic as it gets. Outvote them convincingly. 
KagroX	714289258102595586	2016-03-28T03:13:24	I'm willing to consider a system that doesn't reserve power, but that's largely bc I haven't worked for any. 
KagroX	714288884138422272	2016-03-28T03:11:55	chris_amundsen Apinak PizzOffington There is that. But I accept that, because somebody's got to do some decision-making here!
KagroX	714288536183291904	2016-03-28T03:10:32	JoeDownShea trayNTP Why bother denying it? What good would that do?
KagroX	714288374064898049	2016-03-28T03:09:53	Well, doesn't matter, right? One vote is enough. And I'd be OK with that, even though it'd be bullshit. The rule has a reason.
KagroX	714288208431833088	2016-03-28T03:09:14	If you win by 1 vote, you win. If you get to cast that 1 vote because someone's provisional ballot didn't count? Or you're a rounding error?
KagroX	714287790809178112	2016-03-28T03:07:34	DOmidvar If you win a majority of delegates, without superdelegates, you win.
KagroX	714287660106326016	2016-03-28T03:07:03	If you hand them the opportunity, yes. So don't. 
KagroX	714287547283705857	2016-03-28T03:06:36	DOmidvar And basically, the superdelegates have the job of campaigning &amp; governing directly with the nominee, while delegates, indirect.
KagroX	714287241674096640	2016-03-28T03:05:23	Be the next class of DNC bigwigs. 
KagroX	714287160757604353	2016-03-28T03:05:04	DOmidvar A majority does win, though.
KagroX	714286311859994624	2016-03-28T03:01:42	Sure it is. That's exactly what it is. 
KagroX	714286175469576192	2016-03-28T03:01:09	I appreciate the clarity of winning at convention even by one vote. But I also know some delegates are there as rounding errors.
KagroX	714285845054930945	2016-03-28T02:59:50	Would I mind? Probably not. Tell me about the provisions for tie-breaking, etc. 
KagroX	714285533468471296	2016-03-28T02:58:36	They shouldn't. But don't lose sight of the fact that the whole system incorporates rounding errors, start to finish 
KagroX	714285084896047104	2016-03-28T02:56:49	A few weeks ago, we were all going nuts over coin tosses as tie-breakers. But asking the Congress a POTUS would work with is bonkers?
KagroX	714284842888871936	2016-03-28T02:55:51	Donald__Dump I'm checking myself for injuries. I don't see any. So I'm OK!
KagroX	714284686672076800	2016-03-28T02:55:14	It's impossible not to have such a system and get to where my hypothetical put us. So, no. No problem! 
KagroX	714284326339391491	2016-03-28T02:53:48	I don't. I only pretend it's a not-completely-off-the-wall tie-breaker. 
KagroX	714284179329052672	2016-03-28T02:53:13	It certainly could be. And they'll have to weigh that, no doubt. That's the idea. 
KagroX	714280318577090562	2016-03-28T02:37:53	He does, too. Trust me, I am his local committee. KagroX: That's why I tell them to run for local Dem. committee or even DNC...
KagroX	714283814810292224	2016-03-28T02:51:46	Unfortunately, I prefer dictatorship and corruption and stuff. 
KagroX	714283199174586369	2016-03-28T02:49:20	KagroX This requires that inside/outside game, coalitions, defeats early, slow wins. Insta SD rule change not a microwave TV dinner. Work..
KagroX	714283518243635200	2016-03-28T02:50:36	KateFangman PizzOffington Well, he's arguing that elected Dems should think about what their constituents prefer, and that's not bad.
KagroX	714283292585910276	2016-03-28T02:49:42	I don't mind a system that takes opinions of elected Dems into account in cases where the vote is super close. 
KagroX	714283030211219456	2016-03-28T02:48:39	mharris621 Apinak PizzOffington I'm OK with the idea. I'd be open to a vote on a different system if a good one were proposed.
KagroX	714282837403242496	2016-03-28T02:47:53	TolstoyFC DemFromCT That's the plan.
KagroX	714282635627868161	2016-03-28T02:47:05	Then don't let their votes matter. You can do that in exactly the way you prefer: voting. Put up the numbers. 
KagroX	714282250049884160	2016-03-28T02:45:33	It's not binary. I am OK with superdelegates, but it's not necessarily my first choice. I'm OK with changing it. 
KagroX	714281755373670400	2016-03-28T02:43:35	KagroX So you don't support the status quo on superdelegates? I am finding it hard to locate your position here. It's binary.
KagroX	714281867311202306	2016-03-28T02:44:02	Then don't give them the opportunity. Outvote them overwhelmingly and they can do nothing. 
KagroX	714281651942137856	2016-03-28T02:43:11	That's how it would work in the DNC meeting that would vote on a new rules package. Now, get yourself there. 
KagroX	714281420450082817	2016-03-28T02:42:15	Maybe this sort of malicious oversimplification is why you've never gotten anyone to change the rules you don't like 
KagroX	714281094334517249	2016-03-28T02:40:58	KagroX 
KagroX	714281008900784128	2016-03-28T02:40:37	If you think the rules suck, you can scream, burn them, or learn how to change them.
KagroX	714280799026020352	2016-03-28T02:39:47	I support them versus letting you change them unilaterally. 
KagroX	714280693530886146	2016-03-28T02:39:22	Apinak PizzOffington The number that it took to elect them to the position by virtue of which they are superdelegates.
KagroX	714280508046188544	2016-03-28T02:38:38	SandraHelena39 But maybe we don't! I find it a fair system because I know how you can be skeptical of it and see it changed.
KagroX	714280294535172097	2016-03-28T02:37:47	I allow for them. Support assumes too much. Make me an offer on a new rules package and let's see what we can sell. 
KagroX	714280118710091776	2016-03-28T02:37:05	I mean, rage alone won't change the rules of the convention. Not even if you add a Frank Zappa avatar to it.
KagroX	714279847535763456	2016-03-28T02:36:00	SandraHelena39 I don't know that that's anyone's opinion of what superdelegates really do, though. Maybe. But not mine.
KagroX	714279665876267008	2016-03-28T02:35:17	Sure I do. That's why I tell them to run for local Dem. committee or even DNC, and then they can change the rules. 
KagroX	714279388125245444	2016-03-28T02:34:11	SandraHelena39 I don't think that the existence of superdelegates evidences any such sort of complacency.
KagroX	714279214967623682	2016-03-28T02:33:30	SandraHelena39 Yes. The GOP would  KILL to have superdelegates available to them right now!
KagroX	714279014874132480	2016-03-28T02:32:42	PizzOffington I don't think Rendell would, no. But hundreds of DNC members would.
KagroX	714278854861447168	2016-03-28T02:32:04	And if your state's superdelegates vote in a way you don't like, you're free to run against them for DNC, or vote for a primary challenger.
KagroX	714278619690962944	2016-03-28T02:31:08	SandraHelena39 And I think there's more common sense in the convention system that you give credit for.
KagroX	714278416326004736	2016-03-28T02:30:19	PizzOffington You assume to much. I would reluctantly allow a decision to be made that I disagreed with if my preferred method was unclear.
KagroX	714278133680177152	2016-03-28T02:29:12	PizzOffington OK. Hi, I'm back to you, right now.
KagroX	714277972123918336	2016-03-28T02:28:33	To overrule on a nomination, the voters would have to serve up a near tie &amp; superdelegates would have to vote nearly unanimously.
KagroX	714277678380089344	2016-03-28T02:27:23	PizzOffington If they decide by more than 400 votes out of 4,000 available, they can't overturn anything. That's OK to me.
KagroX	714277485744103424	2016-03-28T02:26:37	PizzOffington They may. So it's your job to outvote them overwhelmingly. If you can do it, they have no additional power at convention.
KagroX	714277352398786560	2016-03-28T02:26:06	SandraHelena39 And their second vote counts for nothing if the rank &amp; file make an overwhelmingly clear choice. Seems OK to me.
KagroX	714277180302352384	2016-03-28T02:25:25	PizzOffington And they ARE the last people deciding it. They only CAN decide it if the rank &amp; file can't do it themselves.
KagroX	714276851628314624	2016-03-28T02:24:06	Bye! 
KagroX	714276770351083521	2016-03-28T02:23:47	PizzOffington Yes, just like what I said.
KagroX	714276677342375936	2016-03-28T02:23:25	SandraHelena39 Because they're the ones who have to work directly with a Dem president, as members of Congress and the DNC.
KagroX	714276504897789953	2016-03-28T02:22:44	PizzOffington Even 400 unanimous votes only matter when the rank &amp; file have insisted they're split almost exactly evenly.
KagroX	714276219718672384	2016-03-28T02:21:36	PizzOffington There are 400, and they're outnumbered by pledged delegates 10-to-1.
KagroX	714275955628457984	2016-03-28T02:20:33	trayNTP Well, you can say it's not about opinion, but you'll need to win the opinions of the voting members of the DNC to get your way.
KagroX	714275802368618496	2016-03-28T02:19:56	SandraHelena39 Why do we say they represent no one? They're elected to that position.
KagroX	714275665026031616	2016-03-28T02:19:23	PizzOffington I would be. Because they can only do it if they vote nearly unanimously AND the rank &amp; file can't pick a clear enough winner.
KagroX	714275459844812800	2016-03-28T02:18:34	trayNTP Well, we disagree. But the good news is you can change the rules. All you have to do is be elected to the DNC &amp; be a superdelegate.
KagroX	714275261269680128	2016-03-28T02:17:47	PizzOffington No, we didn't. Which is why they so rarely do handpick our next President, and likely won't this time, either.
KagroX	714275097469530112	2016-03-28T02:17:08	DOmidvar You'll have to walk me through that analogy.
KagroX	714274963922882560	2016-03-28T02:16:36	trayNTP Yes, and you miraculously picked two of a total of twenty delegates of the type who hold honorary status.
KagroX	714274768476725250	2016-03-28T02:15:50	trayNTP And I disagree. I think it makes sense to hear from the elected officials who'll have to work with a Dem president.
KagroX	714274600629223424	2016-03-28T02:15:10	TurkanaDK It would require‚Ä¶ a majority of superdelegates.
KagroX	714274506425012224	2016-03-28T02:14:47	PizzOffington Only indirectly by biasing it towards powerful insiders. Whom we've elected to their office, of course. But never mind that.
KagroX	714274225637482498	2016-03-28T02:13:40	trayNTP This is your big panic? Bill Clinton might case one of 4,000+ convention votes?
KagroX	714274000818544640	2016-03-28T02:12:47	PizzOffington They deserve to have a say, and a big one. But they're still outnumbered at the convention by 10 to 1.
KagroX	714273850574430208	2016-03-28T02:12:11	PizzOffington Oh come on. Point me to the constitutional provision about primary elections and party conventions.
KagroX	714273719951179776	2016-03-28T02:11:40	trayNTP Well hell, they can make any case they want. Even the case that there really ARE unicorns. Don't see how it accomplishes much.
KagroX	714273567018520576	2016-03-28T02:11:03	TurkanaDK True. Though one solution to that is for us to grow up already. Not that that's happening any time soon.
KagroX	714273437364174848	2016-03-28T02:10:32	DOmidvar They're pretty much all there as superdelegates because those same votes have been cast for them to be in that job.
KagroX	714273027438063617	2016-03-28T02:08:54	PizzOffington More equal, no. Different jobs? Yes. Members of Congress work with the president differently than you do.
KagroX	714272864116031488	2016-03-28T02:08:16	trayNTP It isn't, though. You think it is, but I doubt very much that electeds &amp; DNC members view cash as equal to what they've put in.
KagroX	714271806404710400	2016-03-28T02:04:03	trayNTP Unicorns don't exist and neither do corporate donors-as-superdelegates. That's imaginary.
KagroX	714271626792030209	2016-03-28T02:03:21	trayNTP And of course, to get that done would require DNC members voting to dilute their own votes. Not too likely.
KagroX	714271316954624001	2016-03-28T02:02:07	trayNTP Same with unicorns, though.
KagroX	714271205369319424	2016-03-28T02:01:40	TurkanaDK They'd only even be in a position to do so if they voted nearly unanimously AMD rank &amp; file were unable to pick a clear favorite.
KagroX	714270683669209088	2016-03-28T01:59:36	TurkanaDK Have they overruled voters?
KagroX	714270544330264576	2016-03-28T01:59:02	trayNTP Corporate donors can cry all they like, but they're not superdelegates. That's a pretty silly distraction.
KagroX	714269438430740481	2016-03-28T01:54:39	trayNTP Because they've put thousands of times more work into building the party than everyone else. And there are about 20 such delegates.
KagroX	714269179231076352	2016-03-28T01:53:37	And that's my unpopular opinion.
KagroX	714269100260728833	2016-03-28T01:53:18	Letting Dem Members of Congress, Govs &amp; DNC members who'd have to campaign &amp; work w a Dem president have a vote in convention seems OK to me
KagroX	714267912081518593	2016-03-28T01:48:35	trayNTP So the argument is that we should treat everyone as we treat pledged delegates except for their essential function. That's, uh...
KagroX	714266680877142016	2016-03-28T01:43:41	IlGreven Well, we know that. But where people demand they "vote with the people," why only some of them?
KagroX	714265766174990337	2016-03-28T01:40:03	Why shouldn't superdelegates cast their votes proportionally, too? Why would they be winner take all?
KagroX	714172089670832129	2016-03-27T19:27:49	Does anybody get money if a student finds a transgender man obeying laws forcing him into the women's bathroom?

KagroX	714119798536474625	2016-03-27T16:00:02	No, you're not allowed to ask if I have a gun permit, and yes, we want you to peep under bathroom stall doors to police transgender people.
KagroX	714112942501789696	2016-03-27T15:32:47	No, you're thinking of Charles C. Johnson.

KagroX	714112321593876481	2016-03-27T15:30:19	terrishea I would think there's a rather long adjudicatory process before you get the money, during which the student would be expelled.

KagroX	713917598342184960	2016-03-27T02:36:34	PhilPerspective downwithtyranny Yes, they do. They hate a lot of things. That can't possibly concern you.
KagroX	713917461683372032	2016-03-27T02:36:01	PhilPerspective And then, after that, they didn't.
KagroX	713917176583991296	2016-03-27T02:34:53	PhilPerspective The other route, of course, is to take them on in the primaries, where it's Dem vs. Dem like with the party elections.
KagroX	713917013748486144	2016-03-27T02:34:14	PhilPerspective Sure. Of course, with making them fear you, you get Sharron Angle and Christine O'Donnell.
KagroX	713915624569847809	2016-03-27T02:28:43	CocoPazzo It's not like it was the most obvious thing in the world!
KagroX	713915042446589953	2016-03-27T02:26:24	PhilPerspective That's a long, long road to socialist revolution, voting Republican.

KagroX	713910925510774785	2016-03-27T02:10:03	PhilPerspective You'd likely have to wait until their next primary, and stay mad for two years.
KagroX	713910784196222977	2016-03-27T02:09:29	PhilPerspective The contest to replace them will always be Dem vs. Dem. With federal elected officials, would you punish them by voting R?
KagroX	713910197589250048	2016-03-27T02:07:09	PhilPerspective They are much more easily replaced than the federal officials, so they'll feel the pressure more clearly.
KagroX	713908783941029888	2016-03-27T02:01:32	PhilPerspective I see this article‚Ä¶  says the state Dem Party superdelegates purposely remained neutral until today.
KagroX	713908578558590976	2016-03-27T02:00:43	PhilPerspective Me too! If only so that they can see that they can win things and be heard &amp; it's not all just corrupt garbage!
KagroX	713908009987141634	2016-03-27T01:58:28	PhilPerspective Does that make some sense to you? I don't mean to harangue you, I just want to explain why I think that.
KagroX	713907521514242049	2016-03-27T01:56:31	PhilPerspective More so than fed. elected officials, since DNC members are the more directly accountable to active Dems. ACTIVE, though!
KagroX	713907336037928960	2016-03-27T01:55:47	PhilPerspective But in any case, I'd guess the DNC member superdelegates  would be the most sensitive to caucus outcomes.
KagroX	713906522707910656	2016-03-27T01:52:33	PhilPerspective If Bernie supporters make it clear they're only coming out for caucus &amp; aren't repeat players, electeds will see that.
KagroX	713905788566315008	2016-03-27T01:49:38	PhilPerspective And if you want to see those changes, get turnout to county Dem. committee meetings to reflect today's caucus turnout.
KagroX	713904841077223426	2016-03-27T01:45:52	PhilPerspective There may be no change. In which case, they're telling you they hear you, but don't think this disagreement will cost them.
KagroX	713904656309755904	2016-03-27T01:45:08	PhilPerspective Now it's on the record. Yesterday it wasn't. I think demanding time travel might leave you set up for disappointment.
KagroX	713904404211040257	2016-03-27T01:44:08	PhilPerspective And WA just voted. Today is literally the first chance anyone's had to evaluate the actual votes cast there.
KagroX	713903757793304576	2016-03-27T01:41:34	PhilPerspective 1. Plenty of time before the convention. 2. Sensitive to constituents doesn't mean taking their dictation.

KagroX	713031355093925888	2016-03-24T15:54:57	JoeDownShea KimShoeCrzy So the better chance of fixing the system might be to keep Bernie a superdelegate after all.
KagroX	713031150336389120	2016-03-24T15:54:08	JoeDownShea KimShoeCrzy On the other hand, who gets to vote on how to fix the system? Convention delegates &amp; DNC members do.

KagroX	713029544987463685	2016-03-24T15:47:45	JoeDownShea There are very, very few such superdelegates. Former DNC chairs are kept on presumably for their institutional memory, etc.
KagroX	713028658756104193	2016-03-24T15:44:14	Of course. And when they see their rank &amp; file voting overwhelmingly for someone, they take that into consideration. 
KagroX	713028393265049600	2016-03-24T15:43:11	JoeDownShea I think if you sit down &amp; consider delegate selection rules, while you might choose different ones, they're not nonsensical.

KagroX	713025382446940162	2016-03-24T15:31:13	It is a generalization. But there's a narrow class of superdels that don't have current constituencies. Dean is 1.

KagroX	713024513672421377	2016-03-24T15:27:46	That's probably because Howard Dean, this Idaho delegate, and I are three separate people.

KagroX	712049896988217344	2016-03-21T22:54:59	MADdelaRosa Sure. It's just not a weapon that forces substantive changes. It's a blunt instrument of punishment. Still missing #2.
KagroX	712047582235774976	2016-03-21T22:45:47	MADdelaRosa I guess the big prob is, you tell Dem institutional players you don't like their thinking, then send them off to do more of it.
KagroX	712047317449371649	2016-03-21T22:44:44	MADdelaRosa I'm still lost as to how he thinks it gets from #1 to #3. Or even someone else's #3.
KagroX	712046778443550722	2016-03-21T22:42:35	MADdelaRosa Good argument for not liking the current Dem party. Good argument for not feeling bad about not voting for them. But no plan.
KagroX	712043078606036994	2016-03-21T22:27:53	MADdelaRosa I had the advantage of having reached my conclusion in this precise manner before stating it.
KagroX	712041773154095105	2016-03-21T22:22:42	MADdelaRosa What "forces Dems left" is changing the makeup of the institutional party. Or popularizing a fully-formed alternative.
KagroX	712041490906742786	2016-03-21T22:21:35	MADdelaRosa Withholding votes from Dems makes Dems lose. Will Dems react? Yes. Will they do what people who went home to stew wanted? IDK!
KagroX	712041044947369984	2016-03-21T22:19:48	MADdelaRosa Yes. It skips the step where Dems say, "We should listen to advice about X." Or even where they figure out what X is.
KagroX	712039093341921281	2016-03-21T22:12:03	MADdelaRosa Besides, I'm granting #1. They do what they want to do and don't vote for Dems. Fine. And then what?
KagroX	712038861837373440	2016-03-21T22:11:08	MADdelaRosa They'll think really, really, really hard about how to make people who didn't support them happier? That's it?
KagroX	712038623571537920	2016-03-21T22:10:11	MADdelaRosa It's hard to argue against if the goal is just seeing them lose. That's why #2 is still ???. What magic makes Dems better?
KagroX	712035594696855552	2016-03-21T21:58:09	MADdelaRosa What is it about not voting for Dems in a general election that changes the kind of people who make up the Dem party apparatus?
KagroX	712035473707950080	2016-03-21T21:57:40	MADdelaRosa No. I think not voting, going home &amp; waiting for the party to convene the same apparatus but come up w something different is.
KagroX	712034549153271809	2016-03-21T21:54:00	MADdelaRosa A national movement? Is this something I can order from Amazon? Is it like Uber, but for revolution?
KagroX	712034411802468355	2016-03-21T21:53:27	MADdelaRosa What is it that comes in between not voting for Dems in 2016, and the rebirth of a progressive Democratic party in 2020?
KagroX	712034161780006912	2016-03-21T21:52:27	MADdelaRosa That's the best there is in the piece. And it's a nothing burger.
KagroX	712032461195251714	2016-03-21T21:45:42	MADdelaRosa ErikLoomis It's certainly personal. But you can change #3 to anything you want. You still have the ??? in #2.
KagroX	712032180390772736	2016-03-21T21:44:35	MADdelaRosa ErikLoomis I think that it does not. Beyond hoping that somebody has a "plan to build a lasting movement."
KagroX	712028482457509888	2016-03-21T21:29:53	MADdelaRosa ErikLoomis I'll agree they're likely fruitless. But the question of "What do you want to do instead?" needs asking, anyway.
KagroX	712027856008843265	2016-03-21T21:27:24	MADdelaRosa ErikLoomis Nor is it really a scolding. For those who DO argue for #3, like this , it's a real question
KagroX	712026290648432640	2016-03-21T21:21:11	MADdelaRosa ErikLoomis Well, let's not go crazy. It just doesn't happen to address you.And that's fine.

KagroX	703270440681107460	2016-02-26T17:28:33	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra Not caring (in the face of rising public resentment of both procedures) is sloppy journalism.
KagroX	703270171486519299	2016-02-26T17:27:29	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra It doesn't require any such assumption to be right about the relationship between the procedures.
KagroX	703269956402565122	2016-02-26T17:26:38	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra Sure. But again, another super lucky hypothetical for you,  but which no one proposes.
KagroX	703269803037847553	2016-02-26T17:26:01	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra Which is what we were asking to begin with.
KagroX	703269739196383232	2016-02-26T17:25:46	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra You could. And having explained it, thereafter you could be clearer on what's happening.
KagroX	703269596116037632	2016-02-26T17:25:12	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra That's fine. Report that the threat of filibuster is actual power behind hold, and Senator's denial. NP
KagroX	703269393547964416	2016-02-26T17:24:24	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra There's nothing about a filibuster that prevents the administration from making concessions to it.
KagroX	703268243339776004	2016-02-26T17:19:49	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra Why can the hold do that, though? Think about what the real power behind it is. Then say it aloud.
KagroX	703268116457914368	2016-02-26T17:19:19	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra That w growing awareness of both filibuster &amp; holds, there's no reason not to explain the relationship.
KagroX	703267949340004352	2016-02-26T17:18:39	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra There are a number of things I think you're "taking" here that are unjustified, but that's not the pt.
KagroX	703267094461337601	2016-02-26T17:15:16	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra Another great point that doesn't actually change the nature of the power behind holds.
KagroX	703266906111873024	2016-02-26T17:14:31	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra Again, we're so, so lucky that no one here has called a hold a filibuster. Except, curiously, you.
KagroX	703266730433519617	2016-02-26T17:13:49	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra What's silly is public outrage over "secret holds" AND over filibusters, and no one say, "well, see‚Ä¶"
KagroX	703266538531463168	2016-02-26T17:13:03	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra Call a hold a threat to filibuster, Sen X angrily denies it, reporter explains it, Sen X looks silly.
KagroX	703266225518825472	2016-02-26T17:11:48	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra Seems simple enough to explain. A hold is a bluff. So, what's the bluff about? Answer: filibuster. Done
KagroX	703265947939831808	2016-02-26T17:10:42	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra So while public outrage over holds &amp; filibusters grows, why not make the linkage plain in coverage?
KagroX	703265197914525700	2016-02-26T17:07:43	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra So again, why not just say it? Isn't it better than saying, "There's a magical power all Senators have"
KagroX	703264924420677633	2016-02-26T17:06:38	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra Be on the floor to do what? Object, force a motion to proceed, and then filibuster that motion.
KagroX	703264146142445568	2016-02-26T17:03:33	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra Luckily, no one here has said they are. They have said it would be worth explaining the relationship.
KagroX	703263461975851008	2016-02-26T17:00:49	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra And so, the really good reason not to report what "holds" actually are is what?
KagroX	703262637329670145	2016-02-26T16:57:33	And one way to "eliminate secret holds" is to just do that routinely. 
KagroX	703262227604840448	2016-02-26T16:55:55	EdDarrell ShelbyDogue metaquest andrewadastra Bc w/o getting that agreement to go, the objecting Senator can threaten to ___________.

KagroX	703257607159586816	2016-02-26T16:37:34	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra Holds don't get overridden. Motions to proceed are passed. That's what really exists in the rules.
KagroX	703257248366247936	2016-02-26T16:36:08	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra What I'm not seeing here is a good argument not to just state what lies behind the power of the "hold."
KagroX	703256659616010240	2016-02-26T16:33:48	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra As a side note, IS there a real need to discuss UC in the rules? That's just general parliamentary law.
KagroX	703256399560609795	2016-02-26T16:32:46	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra Right. So why not just talk about what the actual threat is?
KagroX	703255794205069313	2016-02-26T16:30:21	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra Yes. There are things in the rules besides those things which I said were not in them.
KagroX	703255619734773760	2016-02-26T16:29:40	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra And a hold has no teeth behind it but the threat to withhold UC &amp; filibuster a motion to proceed.
KagroX	703255461307535360	2016-02-26T16:29:02	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra We actually do know what they are. We just prefer to get right to the point &amp; call them what they are.
KagroX	703255058729848832	2016-02-26T16:27:26	EdDarrell metaquest andrewadastra Starting with the fact that neither the filibuster nor the hold are mentioned anywhere in Senate rules.

KagroX	703254430100099073	2016-02-26T16:24:56	Others disagree. 
KagroX	703253693265747969	2016-02-26T16:22:00	They might be better served by simply reporting them as threats to filibuster, which is what they are. 
KagroX	703253324582264832	2016-02-26T16:20:33	This is the sort of short-cut that often leaves the press flat-footed on stories like filibuster reform procedure.
