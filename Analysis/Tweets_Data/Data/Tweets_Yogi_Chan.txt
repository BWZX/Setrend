Yogi_Chan	660379727291678720	2015-10-31T08:56:10	KaiPflughaupt haha!!!
Yogi_Chan	660379359656677376	2015-10-31T08:54:43	KaiPflughaupt + as infl base effects wear off, growth will be slowing while infl rising, making Fed's challenge even more difficult
Yogi_Chan	660379054055534592	2015-10-31T08:53:30	KaiPflughaupt missed window a few months ago IMO. If they miss Dec, I wouldn't be surprised if we were on hold for another year
Yogi_Chan	660378755110739968	2015-10-31T08:52:19	KaiPflughaupt Astonishing!!!!
Yogi_Chan	660377257198907392	2015-10-31T08:46:21	KaiPflughaupt yeah! You know they'll justify it by calling it a 'new normal' - a new normal they heralded
Yogi_Chan	660376339388751872	2015-10-31T08:42:43	And the kicker: 'The only time the Fed raised rates after a sub-two per cent growth quarter, a three-year equity bear market followed'
Yogi_Chan	660375648708526080	2015-10-31T08:39:58	DB adds: S&amp;P500 rose 10% on average in the 12 months following those 31 hikes but fell 7% after rate cuts
Yogi_Chan	660375233447227392	2015-10-31T08:38:19	It was 1.5% in Q3 (as if you needed reminding)
Yogi_Chan	660374957164240896	2015-10-31T08:37:13	DB talking Fed: the 31 hikes since 1994 were preceded by an avg 3.9% quarterly expansion, whereas 1.2% average growth heralded rate cuts
