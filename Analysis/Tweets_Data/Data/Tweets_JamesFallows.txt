JamesFallows	716089554030215168	2016-04-02T02:27:08	If you are tempted to think Trump schism has turned Fox honest, check out this agitprop ‘Obama’s weak military’ special from tonight.
JamesFallows	716084384923783168	2016-04-02T02:06:36	I will actually destroy the TV if I watch any more of this Fox propaganda on “weak” military under the evil BHO, so time for a beer.
JamesFallows	716083899684753408	2016-04-02T02:04:40	More subtle than its horse-race coverage, but maybe more damaging: Fox putting on agitprop special now on “weak” and “shrinking” US military
JamesFallows	716080008545042438	2016-04-02T01:49:12	Accepting 2 premises makes 99% of GOP news unnecess: 1) Trump doesn’t know anything, about anything 2) No way to tell if he’ll be nominee

JamesFallows	703955748737392640	2016-02-28T14:51:44	Serious Q; How many college-grad Americns never heard of Ku Klux Klan, as Trump claims? Or Boomer-era people never heard of David Duke?
JamesFallows	703953337369104385	2016-02-28T14:42:09	Trump claims he “knows nothing about” 1) KKK 2) David Duke so not in position to comment on their endorsement of him 
JamesFallows	703778283268284416	2016-02-28T03:06:32	PaulJohnScott OK, tell me what’s inaccurate
JamesFallows	703777902454816770	2016-02-28T03:05:02	One of the few things Bernie Sanders will regret about his campaign is seeming churlish rather than gracious about HRC’s big SC win
JamesFallows	703777378506559488	2016-02-28T03:02:57	ehirsch Right, but “released a statement” is different from “began his speech…"
JamesFallows	703776327594328064	2016-02-28T02:58:46	erickehoe Agree, but it should matter to him.
JamesFallows	703776276365053952	2016-02-28T02:58:34	PaulJohnScott That was apparently 15 seconds on tarmac when getting out of plane. Not classy to avoid it in his “real” speech
JamesFallows	703775843135459329	2016-02-28T02:56:51	To Sen. Sanders staff in real time: PLEASE before he gets off the stage right now, he *must* say something gracious about HRC &amp; SC results
JamesFallows	703775162483744769	2016-02-28T02:54:08	JamesFallows ChristineLSloc  Ah, OK, a tarmac statement. But it would be better to say something in this speech right now
JamesFallows	703774777090121728	2016-02-28T02:52:37	ChristineLSloc But I think that was a press release, vs what he’s actually said from stage, right?
JamesFallows	703774599528521728	2016-02-28T02:51:54	bsdtectr Yes, but the classy route is to show up and congratulate the winner when it’s not you
JamesFallows	703773890397519872	2016-02-28T02:49:05	I respect B. Sanders and am glad he has been in the race. But is he actually giving a speech and not mentioning SC results? (did I miss it?)

JamesFallows	702249380787699712	2016-02-23T21:51:14	j_davidreyes The concept of a “Second Gilded Age” **includes** the existence of a great recession, and is worse.

JamesFallows	699377073534726145	2016-02-15T23:37:42	Agree — and, again, he’s just much *looser* and funnier now than he could be when the pressure was on

JamesFallows	699374173609725953	2016-02-15T23:26:11	I actually think GWB is doing better than in office; much more relaxed, less pressure. But, yes, better than Jeb

JamesFallows	687840278892417025	2016-01-15T03:34:36	I think Trump *actually knows* something about China, but in this case he is intentionally dumbing down (as opposed to unintentionally)

JamesFallows	685151672197332992	2016-01-07T17:31:02	NickRiccardi MikeGrunwald OK. Also; part of job of press is to present things in proportion. (Big US problems; relative US successes)
JamesFallows	685150574841573380	2016-01-07T17:26:41	schticknic kdrum Read the articles, Grun + Drum, which address this
JamesFallows	685150354745487360	2016-01-07T17:25:48	NickRiccardi MikeGrunwald 2/2 all problems but also important not to overlook
JamesFallows	685150273380179968	2016-01-07T17:25:29	NickRiccardi MikeGrunwald Right. *Entire world* is subject to these pressures. US handling better than anyplace else. Doesn’t solve 1/2

JamesFallows	684954741399523328	2016-01-07T04:28:30	KBAndersen No, because we’re not going to. (A nuke attach on NK would take out SK as well — like an attack on NJ hitting NY.)
