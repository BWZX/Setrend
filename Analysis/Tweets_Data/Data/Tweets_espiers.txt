espiers	710990480675307521	2016-03-19T00:45:14	cainejw well in that people are allowed to discuss what I've acknowledged, which is that I have *a* sex life. Which I'm fine with:
espiers	710990152265539584	2016-03-19T00:43:56	cainejw ok now I realize you don't understand the legal point of what it means to profit. I don't make money off of Twitter ads.
