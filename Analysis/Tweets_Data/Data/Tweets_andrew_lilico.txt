andrew_lilico	725995765080924160	2016-04-29T10:30:53	JoMicheII I don't say *you* did. :-)
andrew_lilico	725995657073451008	2016-04-29T10:30:27	ChrisGiles_ So having no barriers is best for GDP. Qstn might be the strategy to get to no barriers - eg keeping some barriers to negotiate
andrew_lilico	725995199713914880	2016-04-29T10:28:38	JoMicheII I can see some folk believing that. But claim that "only nutters are opposed to protecting domestic industry" isn't right.
andrew_lilico	725994854283640832	2016-04-29T10:27:16	ChrisGiles_ I don't agree you're characterising normal economic views correctly. Some economists like partial protectionism. Many don't.
andrew_lilico	725993500177760258	2016-04-29T10:21:53	JoMicheII So you think protecting the domestic economy can sometimes be good for GDP (setting aside infant industry &amp; strategic arguments)?
andrew_lilico	725993194945699840	2016-04-29T10:20:40	JoMicheII I'm astonished that this appears to be unfamiliar territory! Have you really not encountered this thought many times before?
andrew_lilico	725992591951536129	2016-04-29T10:18:16	JoMicheII The idea is that import barriers hurt our economy as well as our partner's. So they're better gone. Is that really controversial?
andrew_lilico	725992295191986176	2016-04-29T10:17:06	JoMicheII Lower barriers to trade all round. More open economy. More competition. Higher productivity. Cheaper goods. More product choice.
andrew_lilico	725991669011718144	2016-04-29T10:14:36	ChrisGiles_ So do you think GDP will be higher if there are some regional barriers than if there are no global barriers to trade?
andrew_lilico	725991301964042240	2016-04-29T10:13:09	JoMicheII I don't understand the qstn. Can you re-phrase?
andrew_lilico	725991008136253440	2016-04-29T10:11:59	JoMicheII Wld you agree usual objection to unilateral free trade is strategic - we keep our barriers now to negotiate cuts in theirs later?
andrew_lilico	725990826380283904	2016-04-29T10:11:15	JoMicheII None comparable now. All that do it are smaller than us. UK did it itself for many decades, of course.
andrew_lilico	725990598730223617	2016-04-29T10:10:21	ChrisGiles_ I think usual objection to unilateral free trade is strategic - by keeping barriers in short-term we can negotiate cuts later
andrew_lilico	725990169363529728	2016-04-29T10:08:39	JoMicheII Yes. That's a very traditional idea. Some countries even do it now.
andrew_lilico	725989928874684417	2016-04-29T10:07:41	.ChrisGiles_ Now, I don't favour unilateral free trade. But that's not because I deny it wld be best for GDP.
andrew_lilico	725989805927051264	2016-04-29T10:07:12	.ChrisGiles_ You see, I think many economists believe unilateral free trade is best for GDP. We learn that with our mother's milk.
andrew_lilico	725989143982051328	2016-04-29T10:04:34	ChrisGiles_ I'm not asking about that model. I said that. I'm asking whether belief in unilateral free trade is unusual among economists
