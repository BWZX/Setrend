Atul_Gawande	719501402561724416	2016-04-11T12:24:36	9. Unstudied: how education/cognition affects lifespan, w better behavior, planning, ability to navigate health sys 
Atul_Gawande	719500199966744576	2016-04-11T12:19:49	8. Local factors that do matter were: amt of local govt spending, pop density, % of college grads, % of immigrants. All GOOD for lifespan.
Atul_Gawande	719499752673525761	2016-04-11T12:18:03	7. BUT: the report did not find a significant contribution to lifespan differences from car crashes, suicide, or homicide.
Atul_Gawande	719498239754510336	2016-04-11T12:12:02	6. Life expectancy among low income was strongly affected by health behaviors, esp smoking, obesity, and (positively) exercise.
Atul_Gawande	719497648496123908	2016-04-11T12:09:41	5. Also surprisingly: greater residential segregation by income did not correlate w lower lifespan --if anything, life span was higher (?!)
Atul_Gawande	719496563740045314	2016-04-11T12:05:23	4. Level of income inequality, religiosity, or racial concentration were NOT independently associated w lifespan (surprisingly).
Atul_Gawande	719496234994679808	2016-04-11T12:04:04	3. Higher overall Medicare spending does not correlate with longer life. But higher preventive care spending DOES.
Atul_Gawande	719495908824596481	2016-04-11T12:02:46	3. Where you live matters a lot -- if you are low income. You have the lowest life expectancy in: NV, IN, OK. Highest in: CA, NY, VT.
