MrWalterShapiro	725469460753162241	2016-04-27T23:39:32	Terrific piece on Trump and Page Six. As former editor Susan Mulcahy says, "He lied about everything, with gusto."

MrWalterShapiro	725390312374427652	2016-04-27T18:25:02	.nielslesniewski Serious answer: All power lies with the Convention delegates. Cruz as nominee can recommend, but he can't name anyone.
MrWalterShapiro	725388756266700804	2016-04-27T18:18:51	To Cruz's credit, voters should know nominee's VP choice before end of primaries. Otherwise, the Convention acts like the Soviet Politburo.
MrWalterShapiro	725386424896372737	2016-04-27T18:09:35	jbarnyla Why? No debates in 1964, 1972 and 1976. And Trump already boycotted a GOP debate. Why should he necessarily follow script here?
MrWalterShapiro	725384267266691072	2016-04-27T18:01:00	That assumes that Trump is willing to debate. He will fight every detail of the format and then maybe boycott them.

MrWalterShapiro	725370651687702528	2016-04-27T17:06:54	In my column this morning () I suggest Trump is more obsessed with R-E-S-P-E-C-T than Aretha.

MrWalterShapiro	725164002838503427	2016-04-27T03:25:45	.jarowley That history is why many wrongly thought Nixon was going left in picking Agnew who had, as I recall, backed Rockefeller.
MrWalterShapiro	725162690633715712	2016-04-27T03:20:32	Mahoney only got 30% to win primary so no parallel. I recall his slogan: "Your Home Is Your Castle. Protect It."  
MrWalterShapiro	725161130243571713	2016-04-27T03:14:20	Actually you have defined Super-Duper Tuesday.  
MrWalterShapiro	725146932147019776	2016-04-27T02:17:55	It's official. There is no Republican Party. Trump beat Kasich in Greenwich. The home of Prescott Bush.

MrWalterShapiro	724604575332884480	2016-04-25T14:22:47	Totally agree that it's late. But it's no more cynical than it would have been pre-Florida.

MrWalterShapiro	724443918054645760	2016-04-25T03:44:24	Republicans will fatally split in Cleveland. The question is whether they do it with honor (stopping Trump) or not. 
MrWalterShapiro	724443066065666052	2016-04-25T03:41:01	Just be thankful that Cleveland has air-conditioning. Dems went 103 ballots over two weeks in 1924 without it.

MrWalterShapiro	724429426742726656	2016-04-25T02:46:49	How do you not talk about it when you want to send message to anti-Trump Republicans who want to vote strategically? 
MrWalterShapiro	724427537481404416	2016-04-25T02:39:18	True. But reaching agreement among two candidates who differ on so much is hard. Thrilled that it happened at all.  
MrWalterShapiro	724426905999540224	2016-04-25T02:36:48	It wasn't a bad strategy, Mr. President. But in Trump, Cruz and Kasich have an adversary who isn't on your level.

MrWalterShapiro	724425647783874560	2016-04-25T02:31:48	.darreldrowland Disagree about "reek." Kasich and Cruz are uniting to save GOP from nominee who is ignorant and cares nothing about issues.
MrWalterShapiro	724424278263910401	2016-04-25T02:26:21	.darreldrowland Actually, it's not. As long as the suggestions are in media rather than in whispered conversation then it's legally legit.
MrWalterShapiro	724424008230424576	2016-04-25T02:25:17	I cheer the Cruz-Kasich Accord. Republicans and journalists who calls this cynical will have to deal with Reagan doing same thing in 1968.
MrWalterShapiro	724384008021368832	2016-04-24T23:46:20	Worth recalling Shrum was Edwards' media consultant in 1998 and was torn between Edwards and Kerry (client) in 2004.

MrWalterShapiro	724259293487357953	2016-04-24T15:30:46	Not since Bruce Babbitt has a presidential candidate received such glowing press clips compared to his vote totals.  
MrWalterShapiro	724253897569775618	2016-04-24T15:09:19	.DemFromCT Of course, many Democrats these days prefer political purity to winning elections.
MrWalterShapiro	724252118853496832	2016-04-24T15:02:15	If Trump is GOP nominee, Republicans for Hillary will be a big thing. And the Koch comments are an early barometer.  
MrWalterShapiro	724049755719000065	2016-04-24T01:38:08	I think case could be made for major FDR aides or senators like Phil Hart, but agree that Wofford is right up there.

MrWalterShapiro	708135901029859328	2016-03-11T03:42:09	Kasich has a great answer both faulting the media's obsession with predicting and invoking Reagan and, yes Nixon.
MrWalterShapiro	708134458516512768	2016-03-11T03:36:26	Cruz's best argument of the right even if he rehearsed it.
MrWalterShapiro	708131902251769856	2016-03-11T03:26:16	Cruz fact check; Iranians released hostages minutes after Reagan's inauguration because they hated Carter not because they feared Reagan.
MrWalterShapiro	708129379826667520	2016-03-11T03:16:15	Trump's foreign policy on Cuba seems to be making the world safe for Trump casinos in Havana.
MrWalterShapiro	708128755626147840	2016-03-11T03:13:46	Rubio by having a coherent position on Cuba attacks Trump more forcefully than if he were in a new insult match.
MrWalterShapiro	708125594802855936	2016-03-11T03:01:12	NYRangersss Please understand that my point was how hard Trump works to play the Jewish card.
MrWalterShapiro	708124736312745986	2016-03-11T02:57:48	Trump: Some of my best relatives are Jews.
MrWalterShapiro	708122096275202048	2016-03-11T02:47:18	So much for the kinder gentler Trump.
MrWalterShapiro	708120638041542656	2016-03-11T02:41:31	MikeMadden You had a weird class. Always Smoot-Hawley. See the Gore-Perot debate over NAFTA.
MrWalterShapiro	708120171853058050	2016-03-11T02:39:39	Contrarian notion -- A civil debate plays to Cruz's strengths because he is the best debater on stage and has coherent far-right ideology.
MrWalterShapiro	708081897432219648	2016-03-11T00:07:34	Question for Trump: Is everyone in campaign authorized to physically attack reporters or is this honor reserved for campaign manager?
MrWalterShapiro	708073246957162496	2016-03-10T23:33:12	I am awash in nostalgia for a blessed land from long ago -- Monday night. It was only night in the last five without debates or a primary.
MrWalterShapiro	708055573829455873	2016-03-10T22:22:58	I assume Dr. Carson will bring millions of thinking people and eggheads with him.  
MrWalterShapiro	707992061253959680	2016-03-10T18:10:35	Maybe biggest question facing GOP. Likely scenario at end of primaries is Trump with delegate lead but no majority. 
MrWalterShapiro	707920844580904960	2016-03-10T13:27:36	Bebo We work with what we're given when we ask a question. I agree though about fighting.
MrWalterShapiro	707917202641526784	2016-03-10T13:13:08	Michigan: Bad polls, pack journalism, misleading political maps and other lessons from a wrong-o primary. My column: 
MrWalterShapiro	707916192476958720	2016-03-10T13:09:07	I asked Cruz the "would you fight or surrender?" question if Trump were ahead in delegates after primary. Column: 
MrWalterShapiro	707787114323251202	2016-03-10T04:36:12	Bencjacobs stuartpstevens You win. That's the Bernie tweet of the night.
MrWalterShapiro	707787011982286848	2016-03-10T04:35:48	EricMGarcia I'm an admirer of Warren Christopher. And I recall his look into the LA police after (wasn't it?) Rodney King.
MrWalterShapiro	707786680447737856	2016-03-10T04:34:29	.Bencjacobs stuartpstevens You've missed big one. Does Bernie support foreign policy legacy of Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan?
MrWalterShapiro	707785525973934080	2016-03-10T04:29:54	.stuartpstevens Warren Christopher is going to be big in 2020 GOP debates.
MrWalterShapiro	707782650447196160	2016-03-10T04:18:28	This tweet may be the best of the evening. I have a smile on my face just thinking about "Spy."  
MrWalterShapiro	707782196132765696	2016-03-10T04:16:40	kcm74 mnoormo1 greenfield64 That matters too. I read lengthy but great NY Times series on Hillary and Libya.
MrWalterShapiro	707781938791194624	2016-03-10T04:15:38	I have busy schedule. DNC should put new debates on calendar before I commit to, say, staying home to watch movies.  
MrWalterShapiro	707781207472394242	2016-03-10T04:12:44	.mnoormo1 greenfield64 Bernie Sanders was in his mid-40s during his semi-infatuation with Sandinistas and Cuba. Adult behavior matters.
MrWalterShapiro	707780264160796672	2016-03-10T04:08:59	ElizabethDrewOH Because I am constrained by 140 characters from revealing the true dimensions of my anti-poll agenda.
MrWalterShapiro	707778135723524097	2016-03-10T04:00:32	Bernie from my 1985 profile in New England Monthly: "I think what is least important is [making] a judgment on the Sandinista government."
MrWalterShapiro	707774929178136576	2016-03-10T03:47:47	Kudos to Hillary for going after naïveté of Bernie on human rights in the 1970s and 1980s.
MrWalterShapiro	707774649854201857	2016-03-10T03:46:40	Fascinating that 83 years after FDR's inauguration we are still talking about the first 100 days.
MrWalterShapiro	707774157606486016	2016-03-10T03:44:43	Prediction: Henry Kissinger will not be mentioned in any 2020 debate.
MrWalterShapiro	707771529036218369	2016-03-10T03:34:16	Telltale sign. When Hillary starts an answer with "Well" we know she won't answer the question.
MrWalterShapiro	707770511560941568	2016-03-10T03:30:14	Bernie, Bernie, why do you talk about yourself in the third person?
MrWalterShapiro	707769293333729281	2016-03-10T03:25:23	That is the unacknowledged cost of Hillary losing Michigan.  
MrWalterShapiro	707767987395231744	2016-03-10T03:20:12	You're right. Bernie should talk about his House record more.  
MrWalterShapiro	707766848759209984	2016-03-10T03:15:41	If I had my way, the word "poll" would be banned from all debate questions for eternity.
MrWalterShapiro	707764338480775168	2016-03-10T03:05:42	Scorecard -- 22 Bernie "Fact Checks" in first hour of debate. That works out to 524 Fact Checks per day.
MrWalterShapiro	707763193767206912	2016-03-10T03:01:09	Message to Bernie; True populists don't talk about themselves in the third person.
MrWalterShapiro	707762689788006400	2016-03-10T02:59:09	It would be wonderful if Hillary would respond to questions about reason Wall Street gave her speaking fees by saying, "They're groupies."
MrWalterShapiro	707760812941778945	2016-03-10T02:51:42	Message to Sanders campaign: If you send out 18 "fact checks" in first 50 minutes of debate, no one will find important ones. Less is more.
MrWalterShapiro	707755080611729408	2016-03-10T02:28:55	This is the "Let Me Respond To This"!debate.
MrWalterShapiro	707752189301809152	2016-03-10T02:17:25	Isn't question to Hillary: What are you going to do about over-classification as president? We have too many secrets that aren't secrets.
MrWalterShapiro	707750993337970689	2016-03-10T02:12:40	Bigger maybe. But not better than Trump U and its football team "The Fighting Loansharks."  
MrWalterShapiro	707750572414390276	2016-03-10T02:11:00	Is something wrong with my debate audio? Both candidates are speaking English.
MrWalterShapiro	707748568627597312	2016-03-10T02:03:02	My God, I missed the first three minutes of the Hillary-Bernie debate. How will I ever catch up? Probably the whole campaign has changed.

MrWalterShapiro	707711456796676099	2016-03-09T23:35:34	Part of the problem with Rubio's attack on Trump is that it looked fake. Like Rubio changed his personality as often as Al Gore did in 2000.
MrWalterShapiro	707693641721094146	2016-03-09T22:24:47	,RosieGray Something that Mitt Romney should have proved for all eternity in Michigan in 2012.
MrWalterShapiro	707681885158293504	2016-03-09T21:38:04	pbump jayrosen_nyu Just finished column on how it's delegates and not maps. I am delighted you did this. Wonder if Map #2 could be better.
MrWalterShapiro	707612228309090304	2016-03-09T17:01:16	Treasure them. It amazes me how hard it is to find day-to-day details from years before newspapers were digitized.  
MrWalterShapiro	707602949896282112	2016-03-09T16:24:24	.pbump jayrosen_nyu I think problem is the seductiveness of color-coded maps of the US. And spillover from state-based Electoral College.
MrWalterShapiro	707568156861194241	2016-03-09T14:06:09	Reporters always find people who vote strategically because these rare voters tend to hang around campaign events.  
MrWalterShapiro	707422221556436992	2016-03-09T04:26:15	Obviously the anti-Rick Lazio vote was big in Michigan.  
MrWalterShapiro	707419646744518656	2016-03-09T04:16:01	Wait. What? We're allowed to trust our gut?  
MrWalterShapiro	707416207109038080	2016-03-09T04:02:21	Such an important point. We have not seen a recent primary where the anti-Trump Republicans had a major ad budget. 
MrWalterShapiro	707415546606788610	2016-03-09T03:59:44	aedwardslevy For Hillary tonight, that's perfect. Kudos.

MrWalterShapiro	707399056629370880	2016-03-09T02:54:12	I assume the cable networks will now rerun the Trump press conference from the beginning for those who tuned in late.
MrWalterShapiro	707397842860687360	2016-03-09T02:49:23	It works the same way in Putin's Russia. Personally, I am following tonight online until Trump stops speaking.  
MrWalterShapiro	707397566602874880	2016-03-09T02:48:17	daveweigel Is it a moderate GOP reunion or a 1990s Republican House reunion? I've been impressed by Kasich's support from the old days.
MrWalterShapiro	707394587774558208	2016-03-09T02:36:27	Can we lift a glass tonight in honor of the pundits who confidently predicted that GOP nominee just had to be Jeb or Rubio or Scott Walker?
MrWalterShapiro	707381378317475841	2016-03-09T01:43:57	Coincidence, I'm sure.  
MrWalterShapiro	707330955795685378	2016-03-08T22:23:36	We can't have a new plot line. Most of the media nominated Trump last week. And the punditocracy is never wrong.  
MrWalterShapiro	707312284671070209	2016-03-08T21:09:24	Can I simultaneously acknowledge the corruption and revile the evil tenor of the Trump candidacy? 
MrWalterShapiro	707301004748988416	2016-03-08T20:24:35	For lovers of democracy and decency is there a US political figure who better deserves to be the enemy than Trump?  
MrWalterShapiro	707201160877363200	2016-03-08T13:47:50	Les Moonves, CEO of CBS, said that Trump is bad for America, good for CBS. Moonves belongs in Greed Hall of Fame.  
MrWalterShapiro	707199965764984833	2016-03-08T13:43:05	Waking up in Grand Rapids, looking down at Jerry Ford Museum, I'm hoping we'll soon say about Trump, "Our long national nightmare is over."

MrWalterShapiro	707020542990278660	2016-03-08T01:50:07	Should press have been tougher on .realDonaldTrump sooner? 
MrWalterShapiro	706996236147138561	2016-03-08T00:13:32	GOP should ask, "What Would Reagan Do?" He fought to convention in 1976 even though he was 117 votes shy of Ford. Message for anti-Trumpers.
MrWalterShapiro	706941438282612736	2016-03-07T20:35:47	Only the founder of Trump U would have the chutzpah to accuse anyone else of "defrauding the people" in Rubio ad: 
MrWalterShapiro	706922193649864704	2016-03-07T19:19:19	Saturday night at Saginaw County GOP dinner, Kasich still had a small press entourage. All it takes are a few polls. 
MrWalterShapiro	706914793513472001	2016-03-07T18:49:55	But isn't it time for a bunch of misleading national polls to surface? 
MrWalterShapiro	706898937203073024	2016-03-07T17:46:54	Even if Trump won Michigan, GOP race would get crazier with 4-way delegate split if everyone is over 15% threshold. 
MrWalterShapiro	706894049630932993	2016-03-07T17:27:29	JMfreespeech Yes, it was the wrong call.  And they don't have DVRs in motel rooms. I just hope I can get back to NYC avoiding spoilers.
MrWalterShapiro	706869571974787072	2016-03-07T15:50:13	GOP stalwarts in Michigan have no interest in scorched-earth tactics against Trump. I wish it wasn't true. Column: 
MrWalterShapiro	706847861904941056	2016-03-07T14:23:57	.strobetalbott Many answers. 1964 (anti-Goldwater). 1972 (anti-McGovern). 1976 (Jerry Brown and Frank Church running as anti-Carter).
MrWalterShapiro	706847487806586881	2016-03-07T14:22:28	Required reading because it changes Aura of Inevitability story line. Colorado should be in all delegate counts.  
MrWalterShapiro	706846281017245697	2016-03-07T14:17:40	Kudos to NBC News for pointing out at least 112 GOP delegates are unbound. Meaning: Trump needs Florida AND Ohio. 
MrWalterShapiro	706707485428731904	2016-03-07T05:06:09	Maybe I am jaded after constant GOP vulgarity, but Bernie Sanders you're no Rick Lazio or anything close.
MrWalterShapiro	706674854997729281	2016-03-07T02:56:29	jeffjarvis Absolutely. But it is shocking how many political reporters forget this -- or over-hype general election polling in March.
MrWalterShapiro	706674395511721984	2016-03-07T02:54:39	Is Bernie pandering on God issue? He missed his chance to become first presidential candidate to declare, "God is dead -- or never existed."
MrWalterShapiro	706674032192659456	2016-03-07T02:53:13	Trump won't recognize this. But Bernie should -- head-to-head polls 7 months before the November election don't tell us much.
MrWalterShapiro	706671608828657664	2016-03-07T02:43:35	ClydeHaberman My ears couldn't last a full Bernie Sanders term listening to that yelling. Bernie, though, probably would still be vigorous.
MrWalterShapiro	706671125376442368	2016-03-07T02:41:40	Isn't the real Hillary Super PAC issue that Priorities USA Action is on the air in Michigan with ads intervening in a Democratic primary?
MrWalterShapiro	706669096767717376	2016-03-07T02:33:36	That, I suspect, was not accidental word choice by Hillary.  
MrWalterShapiro	706668717900435456	2016-03-07T02:32:06	neverorgthot I assume Moynihan's writings and speeches from the 1990s have been collected. Alas, I don't have a good citation handy.
MrWalterShapiro	706665609711501312	2016-03-07T02:19:45	So did Pat Moynihan whose Senate seat Hillary took.  
MrWalterShapiro	706664999431888896	2016-03-07T02:17:19	Having just gotten 3 debate tweets written over Hillary's name, I have a proposal: Let's have a time-out in debates for candidate tweeting.
MrWalterShapiro	706663888629190657	2016-03-07T02:12:54	If it were a true "racial blind spot," you wouldn't see it -- let alone answer a debate question about it.
MrWalterShapiro	706662988544131072	2016-03-07T02:09:20	A plea: If you're watching "Downton Abbey" instead of debate, please, please don't tweet spoilers to torment those of us who are working.

MrWalterShapiro	706660711850704896	2016-03-07T02:00:17	Memo to both Bernie and Hillary: You can show intensity and passion without shouting. Really. A debate isn't a labor rally.
MrWalterShapiro	706660297818447874	2016-03-07T01:58:38	I'm resisting temptation for cheap-shot tweet. I am struggling. Oh, what the hell: "Bernie has found one business he likes -- gun makers.
MrWalterShapiro	706658858043908096	2016-03-07T01:52:55	Thank you Anderson Cooper for constantly interrupting with the constant "Thank yous."

MrWalterShapiro	706656117196251137	2016-03-07T01:42:02	Just read Sanders' campaign response on auto bailout. I am not an expert, but I'll say at first glance Bernie 's answer isn't convincing.
MrWalterShapiro	706654202186039296	2016-03-07T01:34:25	Hillary's speech greed is only a Democratic issue. Hillary's home-brew server is mostly a GOP-only issue.
MrWalterShapiro	706653800002670592	2016-03-07T01:32:49	Bernie tried to stick too many issues in same attack on Hillary. Super PAC issue is different than the cry to release speech transcripts.
MrWalterShapiro	706653121112625152	2016-03-07T01:30:07	It used to be, "I have a dream." Now it is "I had an amendment."
MrWalterShapiro	706652244733792256	2016-03-07T01:26:38	Oh, the temptations to use this weapon earlier.  
MrWalterShapiro	706649290341539840	2016-03-07T01:14:54	Why is Anderson Cooper constantly cutting off Bernie and Hillary when it's just two candidates over two hours? What's the rush?
MrWalterShapiro	706645724168060929	2016-03-07T01:00:44	Since I'm giving up Downton Abbey for debate, I will amuse myself seeing whether Hillary says "fight" more often than Bernie says "rigged."

MrWalterShapiro	706477904851390466	2016-03-06T13:53:52	Though the end of the British  series does have a finale that should give Frank Underwood nightmares.  
MrWalterShapiro	706464924537589761	2016-03-06T13:02:18	JoshGotbaum Of course, you retweet all compliments. If needed, you can say that the person who praised you and another was "half right."
MrWalterShapiro	706457007553945600	2016-03-06T12:30:50	And they almost never counted -- or referred to -- in the delegate vote tallies. Which creates pro-Trump illusion.  
MrWalterShapiro	706338893025681408	2016-03-06T04:41:29	Danger with this kind of analysis is that too many otherwise smart people confuse it with reality or a prediction. 
MrWalterShapiro	706337718133981184	2016-03-06T04:36:49	Trump: "That's a tremendous amendment. One of my all time favorites.  I'm going to make it better, whatever it is."

MrWalterShapiro	706332260354682880	2016-03-06T04:15:08	So Trump is talking about the people who don't get beat up at his rallies -- like an airline talking about all the planes that land safely.
MrWalterShapiro	706331807780839424	2016-03-06T04:13:20	.StribLopez For Cruz, it's part of who he is. For Trump, it is a deviation from his basic message.
MrWalterShapiro	706328895512027138	2016-03-06T04:01:46	Fascinating that Trump is stressing the Supreme Court -- that's what Democrats traditionally do when they fear they're losing their base.
MrWalterShapiro	706327173280493568	2016-03-06T03:54:55	I'm not that good at math, but despite Trump mania 34.8 percent of delegates tonight doesn't add up to a majority

MrWalterShapiro	706322743831207936	2016-03-06T03:37:19	One tip based on tonight's results -- maybe the media might be a trifle slower with predictions based on everything remaining the same.
MrWalterShapiro	706321753602129920	2016-03-06T03:33:23	Based on tonight's results and my conversations with Michigan Republicans at Saginaw County dinner, the debate may have really hurt Trump.

MrWalterShapiro	706156725729169409	2016-03-05T16:37:37	Last thing I tended was to come across as critical. I just love reminding folks that in old days conventions were truly contentious.
MrWalterShapiro	706148013509615617	2016-03-05T16:03:00	Wrong. Democrats went 103  ballots in 1924 at steamy Madison Square Garden long before air conditioning.

MrWalterShapiro	705791717614751744	2016-03-04T16:27:13	If Kasich, Rubio, Cruz want to later back off their pledge to support Trump as nominee, all they have to do is point to a new Trump outrage.
MrWalterShapiro	705788126648729601	2016-03-04T16:12:56	I would take 9-to-1 odds from Reince and bet heavily on Chaos in Cleveland.

MrWalterShapiro	705620991075065856	2016-03-04T05:08:48	Email header that made me laugh: "Marco Wins on the Issues." If Rubio won the Fox debate, trust me, issues had nothing to do with it.
MrWalterShapiro	705613918325055488	2016-03-04T04:40:42	Isn't precise Kasich strategy hoping that the Rubio and Cruz insults land which the Ohio Governor is above the fray? 
MrWalterShapiro	705611277746438146	2016-03-04T04:30:12	That was the implication in what I just heard. Trump, in effect, is a liar who doesn't he's lying.  
MrWalterShapiro	705608565873106944	2016-03-04T04:19:26	Do we have any photographic evidence that the four candidates weren't crossing their fingers when they said they'd support GOP nominee?
MrWalterShapiro	705605241832652800	2016-03-04T04:06:13	This O'Reilly interview is partly undoing a great night by Fox debate team.
MrWalterShapiro	705602486544027648	2016-03-04T03:55:16	Only way Fox could blot its copy book after the best debate questions in memory is if they aped CNN and gave Trump a post-debate do-over.
MrWalterShapiro	705599149656428544	2016-03-04T03:42:01	Cruz's ideas on how to respond to Trump's bombast tonight have been inspired like "breathe Donald breathe."
MrWalterShapiro	705598530250010624	2016-03-04T03:39:33	Great moments for Cruz and Rubio.
MrWalterShapiro	705596017283047424	2016-03-04T03:29:34	I don't know if it matters, but this has been Cruz and Kasich's best debate by far.
MrWalterShapiro	705592897379377153	2016-03-04T03:17:10	For the record, I wrote that Trump under-performed on Super Tuesday. So did many others.
MrWalterShapiro	705592479203123200	2016-03-04T03:15:30	Winning anti-Trump gambit, "Count to ten Donald."

MrWalterShapiro	705585895831965696	2016-03-04T02:49:21	Rubio just said "special operators" for Libya. I assume they are waiting for our call.
MrWalterShapiro	705584050862481408	2016-03-04T02:42:01	I am more depressed by our politics with this debate than when Abe Ribicoff decried "Gestapo tactics in the streets of Chicago" in 1968.
MrWalterShapiro	705583038265225221	2016-03-04T02:38:00	Biggest Trump lie -- "I have too much respect for the process."
MrWalterShapiro	705582451985403904	2016-03-04T02:35:40	So Trump admits this campaign is a total shuck. Not a surprise, but it is step toward truth in demagoguery.

MrWalterShapiro	705527491524489216	2016-03-03T22:57:16	Remember: A Convention can vote to unbind delegates and some Trump delegates will be party loyalists not Trumpers.  
MrWalterShapiro	705389707375550464	2016-03-03T13:49:46	Will mainstream Republicans show as much gumption in fighting Trump to bitter end as AFL's George Meany did in opposing McGovern in 1972?

MrWalterShapiro	698684247096369153	2016-02-14T01:44:40	It's a real poll so Team Kasich couldn't exactly hide it. Also maybe they've convinced themselves NH bounce is real.

MrWalterShapiro	685205677099356161	2016-01-07T21:05:38	As Showtime is pushing a series on 2016 called "The Circus," I want to mention that America's nuclear codes go to the winner. Not a joke.
MrWalterShapiro	685199335252951044	2016-01-07T20:40:26	Hillary talked about alien babies in 1993. (OK, I brought it up in Esquire interview). Here's my annotated version: 
MrWalterShapiro	685198028190396416	2016-01-07T20:35:14	Esquire asked me to annotate my 1993 profile of Hillary:  It's a reminder of how much Hillary remains unchanged.

MrWalterShapiro	685136079524114433	2016-01-07T16:29:05	For the new rollcall opinion page we're relaunching next week! So excited to have you all!

MrWalterShapiro	685122775938392064	2016-01-07T15:36:13	.benjamin_oc Starting at Roll Call next week but I will hit my full stride once the book is done by the end of the month.
MrWalterShapiro	685122454046511104	2016-01-07T15:34:56	I am thrilled to be joining Roll Call as a twice weekly columnist working for my favorite editor ever MelindaDC 
MrWalterShapiro	685120180830257152	2016-01-07T15:25:54	orrinknox I'm not a Chicago expert, so I bow to your expertise on Rahm's survival chances. My point is the Clinton parallel doesn't work.
MrWalterShapiro	685087276045611008	2016-01-07T13:15:09	In 1998, Bill Clinton had political talent, a loyal Democratic Party and charm. Charmless Rahm only has cynicism.  
MrWalterShapiro	684939309372301312	2016-01-07T03:27:11	Theory: Hillary used private server to cover up political emails from 2009-12.  Result of coverup: Endless problems:

MrWalterShapiro	684894522929754112	2016-01-07T00:29:13	Casablanca. And I'd be shocked shocked if it wasn't.  
MrWalterShapiro	684891713597521920	2016-01-07T00:18:03	RyanLizza Great piece but it says Clinton lost his congressional race in 1972. That year he ran Texas for McGovern. Congress race was 1974.
MrWalterShapiro	684871560675602432	2016-01-06T22:57:59	There are so many valid policy and personality reasons to go after Ted Cruz. Instead, we get more birther nonsense: 
MrWalterShapiro	684762307134644224	2016-01-06T15:43:50	Fascinating profile () of Hillary's director of talent acquisition. Yes, that's the job title of Nathaniel Koloc.
MrWalterShapiro	684616419997315072	2016-01-06T06:04:08	Don't you understand, all that happens in the world (even traffic jams in Shanghai) is caused by Obama's weakness. 
MrWalterShapiro	684590014072750081	2016-01-06T04:19:13	.JonSeaton18 Yikes. Now that you mention it, I can't think of memorable convention since then. So boring I went to Ohio to watch 2004 GOP.
MrWalterShapiro	684587705657901056	2016-01-06T04:10:02	.JonSeaton18 Buchanan's writings can be scary. As was "Culture Wars" speech at 1992 Convention. But he downplayed this side in NH in 1996.
MrWalterShapiro	684575676586942465	2016-01-06T03:22:14	In 1996, Buchanan was having fun. He invited media to watch him cut radio ads. He showed little Trump anger. (2/2) 
MrWalterShapiro	684574779467259904	2016-01-06T03:18:40	Buchanan campaigning in NH in 1996 was (despite his views) a Happy Warrior. Yes, I know it's hard to believe. (1/2) 
MrWalterShapiro	684565229850746880	2016-01-06T02:40:44	Reading this great column, I began wondering if maybe Derek Jeter's election to the Hall of Fame won't be unanimous. 
MrWalterShapiro	684539869734006784	2016-01-06T00:59:57	How could they tell? (Hat tip: Dorothy Parker). 
MrWalterShapiro	684507836248899584	2016-01-05T22:52:40	This is problem with advertising on the web. Personally, I'd subscribe to Twitter for $50 to keep it like it was.  
MrWalterShapiro	684449211883098112	2016-01-05T18:59:43	FrankLynchBkln I loved the history of the BunaB. I suspect that Professor Harold Hill would have been even more impressed than I was.
MrWalterShapiro	684447777661796354	2016-01-05T18:54:01	Please insert your favorite "Music Man" gag about Rubio as the Cuban-American Professor Harold Hill.

MrWalterShapiro	684218881385304064	2016-01-05T03:44:28	I would love to meet only person on earth who had high expectations for Congress in 2016 -- and now dream is over.  
MrWalterShapiro	684129803163840512	2016-01-04T21:50:30	Smart roundtable on 2016 with David Yepsen, Reid Wilson and Bill Whalen. I almost forgot I was to the point as well. 
MrWalterShapiro	683985335789948928	2016-01-04T12:16:26	Excellent 1PatriciaMurphy on the GOP's Ryan-Trump problem: "One makes sense. The other makes headlines."  rollcall
MrWalterShapiro	683793848150134784	2016-01-03T23:35:32	Personally I liked inspiring bit where Trump admitted cutting off sick child's health insurance because he was angry 
MrWalterShapiro	683791120334217216	2016-01-03T23:24:41	PeriArnold I think it is branding in telling the life story of each reporter.  I prefer succinct IDs like "X won the Nobel Peace Prize."
MrWalterShapiro	683788565344595968	2016-01-03T23:14:32	DriverContainer mckaycoppins Thanks for the free book offer but I am happily reading my own purchased copy on the Acela heading to DC.
MrWalterShapiro	683781801370755073	2016-01-03T22:47:40	Pundits have forecasted 20 of the past zero brokered conventions.
MrWalterShapiro	683780155282690049	2016-01-03T22:41:07	On many quick stories in Politico, I am seeing author bios that are longer than the articles. I can't decide if it's funny or annoying.
MrWalterShapiro	683503995944570880	2016-01-03T04:23:46	.charlesmurray My original point is presidential reading lists are always a fiction designed to create illusion of President as Superman.

MrWalterShapiro	683442575928332288	2016-01-03T00:19:42	Cash gap is meaningless. Hillary has much bigger infrastructure to support. But I can't see how money saves Bernie. 
MrWalterShapiro	683408142454120448	2016-01-02T22:02:52	.HenryJGomez mckaycoppins I hope the Joe Lieberman chapters aren't too much of an ordeal. I also guessed wrong when Graham dropped out.
MrWalterShapiro	683407724923731970	2016-01-02T22:01:13	mckaycoppins I will be reading your book it soon. In fact, I may assign for a seminar I teach at Yale. I just got irked by WPost review.
MrWalterShapiro	683404848994365440	2016-01-02T21:49:47	As guy who wrote book ("One-Car Caravan") before 2004 primaries, I resent snark at mckaycoppins for, say, focusing on Jindal and not Trump.
MrWalterShapiro	683392978296172544	2016-01-02T21:02:37	This is the point in the 2016 cycle when I admire the hope and determination of candidates who are chasing rainbows. 
MrWalterShapiro	683392440041078784	2016-01-02T21:00:29	Chicken ruining a Caesar salad is bad 20th Century. Lanes for nomination are worse 21st Century. I'd go with Lanes.  
MrWalterShapiro	683383444798357504	2016-01-02T20:24:44	Dale Bumpers deserves an obit that is funny instead of grave. I hope someone is writing it.  
MrWalterShapiro	683345348941746176	2016-01-02T17:53:21	.palafo I had hoped Trump didn't deny it because it was provably true. But truth normally doesn't deter Trump. So I see your point.
MrWalterShapiro	683343129202790400	2016-01-02T17:44:32	Nobody who admits cutting off health insurance to his sick nephew is in sync with anything other than maybe Putin. 
MrWalterShapiro	683338279605907456	2016-01-02T17:25:16	lrozen Also relevant from Times profile is that Trump's tragic brother seemed to be the only likable person in the entire family.
MrWalterShapiro	683336339371225089	2016-01-02T17:17:33	Horrifying: "Mr. Trump retaliated by withdrawing the medical benefits critical to his nephew’s [sick] infant child." 
MrWalterShapiro	683112997447925761	2016-01-02T02:30:04	This is, of course, most serious problem facing nation in 2016. Forget ISIS or economy. It's gender and bathrooms.  
MrWalterShapiro	683098224660508673	2016-01-02T01:31:22	In Salinger's honor, please read "For Esme -- With Love and Squalor." It haunts my memory:  
MrWalterShapiro	683079489534976000	2016-01-02T00:16:55	More than Trump, more than Bernie Sanders, Carly Fiorina today has made the most powerful case for authenticity in politics or tweets.
MrWalterShapiro	682792685430804480	2016-01-01T05:17:16	Wild 2016 political prediction: In November, believe it or not, a man or a woman will be elected President. Happy New Year.
MrWalterShapiro	682577845080690690	2015-12-31T15:03:34	.heathbrown joelmsiegel I came to this theory about 5 years ago when Times tried tiny type in Magazine that infuriated older readers.
MrWalterShapiro	682575578663370752	2015-12-31T14:54:34	.heathbrown joelmsiegel My theory is all news organizations are obsessed with the young to point of antagonizing their real audiences.
MrWalterShapiro	682558560228741121	2015-12-31T13:46:56	And the median age for daytime anchors and guests seems to be about 28. Someone please explain since I can't.  
MrWalterShapiro	682418528511758336	2015-12-31T04:30:30	It should be pointed out that according to Constitutional experts things like 2nd Amendment could be up for grabs.  
MrWalterShapiro	682414961889521668	2015-12-31T04:16:20	.NormOrnstein Funny I've noticed that too. Too bad most free-market fans (and Democrats) don't understand the economics of Politics Inc.
MrWalterShapiro	682401125899845633	2015-12-31T03:21:21	My prediction: You will suddenly feel an insatiable desire for kale.  
MrWalterShapiro	682330829800910848	2015-12-30T22:42:01	Argument for spending despite poli sci research: Might make a marginal difference in caucus and voters expect it.  
MrWalterShapiro	682320512387821574	2015-12-30T22:01:01	Much more money to be made as media consultant than what's available as GOTV adviser. True in 1995 and true today.  
MrWalterShapiro	682318534546952192	2015-12-30T21:53:10	Santorum was on ropes in Iowa a month out. Hillary was doomed in NH in 2008. Dean was unstoppable in 2004.  
MrWalterShapiro	682298620759138311	2015-12-30T20:34:02	MikeMadden Sitting in NYC, that lights-out update was the scariest 27 seconds of my life on Twitter.
MrWalterShapiro	682295585001631744	2015-12-30T20:21:58	ForecasterEnten I've covered presidential races since 1980 and I can't think of year when polling has been so misinterpreted and overhyped.
