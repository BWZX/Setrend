AndyKiersz	687069022748323840	2016-01-13T00:29:54	Rich_893 I think that works if you play every draw. But if you only jump in when prize &gt; $1B or something it's not really zero sum
AndyKiersz	687068440608272384	2016-01-13T00:27:36	jdhenchman I'm away from excel at the moment but sounds plausible. Good times.
AndyKiersz	687061889810063360	2016-01-13T00:01:34	jdhenchman that should say "so that complicates things"
AndyKiersz	687061613568983040	2016-01-13T00:00:28	jakekluth I would worry about multi state lottery commission shutting the game down or invalidating your tickets or something though.
AndyKiersz	687061478466301953	2016-01-12T23:59:56	jakekluth I like this strategy. Would also reduce risk of random jackpot split since everyone stops buying tickets when you announce.
AndyKiersz	687061303857397761	2016-01-12T23:59:14	Rich_893 rolling jackpot games aren't zero sum. Probably a rip off anyway? Yes. But not true zero or negative sum games like most gambling.
AndyKiersz	687061024042827777	2016-01-12T23:58:07	jdhenchman 280 million losing tickets so much hat complicates things.
AndyKiersz	687060945898737664	2016-01-12T23:57:49	jdhenchman oh sure. Just wanted to keep it simple. Also I guess gambling losses are deductible so you could write off a bunch of the (1/2)

AndyKiersz	684522979280220160	2016-01-05T23:52:50	AndyKiersz well I guess more like 3/2 as likely
