RalstonReports	703047059549528064	2016-02-26T02:40:55	"No, there's nothing to add," Trump says about his simplistic statement, indicating, shockingly, he knows nothing about anything.

RalstonReports	703045479756509184	2016-02-26T02:34:38	Did I miss Ben Carson order a fruit salad on stage?
RalstonReports	703044898795028481	2016-02-26T02:32:20	Cognitive idiocy. 
RalstonReports	703044403628105728	2016-02-26T02:30:22	Any other Republican who said Reagan was only "somewhat conservative" would be killed. Not Teflon Don.

RalstonReports	703042456615399428	2016-02-26T02:22:38	Hugh gives Cruz a hanging curve to hit into Trump's face.
RalstonReports	703041943924637696	2016-02-26T02:20:35	Trump is building a  "new Republican Party." One without as many Republicans.
RalstonReports	703041663992639488	2016-02-26T02:19:29	TRUMP CANNOT SAY NEVADA CORRECTLY!
RalstonReports	703041591527641088	2016-02-26T02:19:11	"I don't believe anything Telemundo says," Trump says, making a bigger play for the Hispanic vote.
RalstonReports	703041319506038785	2016-02-26T02:18:07	"This debate was getting too heated and exciting, so here's a question for Ben Carson."

RalstonReports	701891131966009344	2016-02-22T22:07:41	Rurals really turn out, so Cruz's strength there (thanks, adamlaxalt) could be pivotal. Rubio's LDS strength big, too, if large %age. 2/2
RalstonReports	701890777023025152	2016-02-22T22:06:16	Dynamic to watch: Unlike Dems, where only a quarter of voters live outside Vegas (Clark), 40 percent of R voters do. Rurals, Reno key. 1/2
