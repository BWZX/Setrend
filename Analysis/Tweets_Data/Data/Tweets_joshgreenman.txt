joshgreenman	723214930967666688	2016-04-21T18:20:50	Like most of the best artists, Prince failed a lot. A lot.
joshgreenman	723214371627896832	2016-04-21T18:18:37	It's hard to watch news coverage of Prince: born in x, had these hits, known for y. What a foolish thing, summarizing a life like that.

joshgreenman	723210407058403328	2016-04-21T18:02:52	Yes, "Purple Rain" was beyond brilliant. But what made Prince was what he did after: He experimented relentlessly.
joshgreenman	723209819797114882	2016-04-21T18:00:32	And he never got to write the damn memoir.

joshgreenman	723208689885175808	2016-04-21T17:56:02	And in case you're new to Prince, he also wrote "Nothing Compares 2 U" and "Manic Monday" and tons of other great songs he's not famous for.
joshgreenman	723207655477534720	2016-04-21T17:51:56	The best thing about everything on "Purple Rain": perfect pop hooks laced with layers of danger and vulnerability and weirdness.
joshgreenman	723207386345807872	2016-04-21T17:50:52	Prince is dead. Long live Prince.
joshgreenman	723205506140008448	2016-04-21T17:43:23	Prince was never a tough guy. Never a mean guy. His power was all wrapped up in sex and love.

joshgreenman	723198828640231426	2016-04-21T17:16:51	Prince hadn't had a big hit or even a great song in a long time. But he remained an absolutely vital, cross-generational icon.
