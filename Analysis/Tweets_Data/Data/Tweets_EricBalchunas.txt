EricBalchunas	722772688826028033	2016-04-20T13:03:32	My opinion is fund mgrs fleecing retail investors for billions while underperforming deserve way more ridicule than some odd new theme ETF
EricBalchunas	722771541000257542	2016-04-20T12:58:58	No way. While some ETFs worthy of satire, the explosion of ideas/products shows health of industry w tech-like boom.

EricBalchunas	718406321503145986	2016-04-08T11:53:09	I never said it was. Pie grew bc mkt doubled. Outflow trend underneath will be clear over time, prob sped up by DOL.

EricBalchunas	707589104251363328	2016-03-09T15:29:23	@prhuber sure, but it still counts as a thematic ETF hitting it big. GURU, ROBO also doing well. It can happen, but rarely.
EricBalchunas	707588906355662849	2016-03-09T15:28:36	AnoraJourno TheStalwart sure, most are walking dead, but a few like HACK and GURU trade a decent amt.
EricBalchunas	707587625650102274	2016-03-09T15:23:30	Re theme ETFs, they can hit big on occasion, eg HACK has 2x more assets than any Fidelity ETF and more than all of JPM's ETFs combined.
EricBalchunas	707587015324340224	2016-03-09T15:21:05	AnoraJourno TheStalwart Sure, but its also tech sector where just need 1-2 hits to make it worth it. This is same issuer of $800m HACK.
