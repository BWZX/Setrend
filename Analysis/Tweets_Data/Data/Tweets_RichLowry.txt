RichLowry	706663500492488704	2016-03-07T02:11:22	Nancy Reagan, 1921-2016  
RichLowry	706522452990435329	2016-03-06T16:50:54	RIP Nancy Reagan. This is what I woke up to this morning above the Reagan's Palm Springs golf course / vacation spot 
RichLowry	706662865491599362	2016-03-07T02:08:50	Question least likely to elicit an answer in any debate--please, tell us why you are a little bit racist
RichLowry	706661491609608192	2016-03-07T02:03:23	Heartbreaking 
RichLowry	706660581684748288	2016-03-07T01:59:46	More Bernie-splaining--Brooklyn must love it
RichLowry	706344167593607168	2016-03-06T05:02:27	Big secret of the GOP race is that Trump isn't actually that far ahead. Trump 34.4% of votes so far, Cruz 28.6%. 
RichLowry	706342231330975744	2016-03-06T04:54:45	My take on tonight, "Cruz Surges, Trump Shows Vulnerability"  via NRO
RichLowry	706330356077740033	2016-03-06T04:07:34	Trump working very hard to cue cable coverage tomorrow asking throughout the day "Will Rubio get out?"
RichLowry	706330067807424512	2016-03-06T04:06:25	Amazing that Trump is still talking about voter violation
RichLowry	706329172482924544	2016-03-06T04:02:52	Trump seems worn out.
RichLowry	706329152136323072	2016-03-06T04:02:47	Trump, who has threatened to run third party at least five times in the last year, is currently trying to shame anyone who'd vote 3rd party
RichLowry	706328420456800256	2016-03-06T03:59:53	Here’s what the vote in Louisiana looked like as precincts came in.  
RichLowry	706328515797393408	2016-03-06T04:00:15	Amazing how much more coverage KY got than LA, for no good reason. LA shows magnitude of last few days' Cruz surge. 
RichLowry	706328332355371008	2016-03-06T03:59:32	“I love the Republican Party—I love the conservative.”  —Donald Trump, utterly convincingly 💯
RichLowry	706328107561648131	2016-03-06T03:58:38	Trump says he was part of the establishment. Expect to hear Ted Cruz incorporate this into his anti-Trump case very soon
RichLowry	706327076643708928	2016-03-06T03:54:32	Trump drops lame Cruz-Canada joke
RichLowry	706325910564245504	2016-03-06T03:49:54	Latest AP delegate count has Cruz within 82 of Trump, but Rubio 251 behind 
RichLowry	706325886287679488	2016-03-06T03:49:48	Great night for Cruz, and encouraging night for opponents of Trump
RichLowry	706324093700874241	2016-03-06T03:42:41	Seeing huge Rubio-to-Cruz shift from LA's early vote to Election Day vote helps explains Cruz's strength in the KS/ME caucuses.
RichLowry	706325163349024769	2016-03-06T03:46:56	Yep 
RichLowry	706324434152390656	2016-03-06T03:44:02	Most outstanding precincts are in Orleans, St. Tammany, Jefferson and Caddo. None of them great for Cruz, so Trump probably hangs on.
RichLowry	706324966220943361	2016-03-06T03:46:09	He has a knack for it, no doubt 
RichLowry	706324626218033153	2016-03-06T03:44:48	Wonder how many people in LA wish they could have their early vote back
RichLowry	706323830046851072	2016-03-06T03:41:38	Great point 
RichLowry	706323530644848640	2016-03-06T03:40:27	In LA, 4.5 percent margin w/ nearly 80 percent reporting per 
RichLowry	706322577724194816	2016-03-06T03:36:40	Trump carries Jefferson County, KY -- a bit of a surprise.  Still some larger Cruz counties out, but probably not enough.
RichLowry	706322472556072960	2016-03-06T03:36:14	Appears that KY/LA results will be so close that Cruz will still eat into Trump's delegate lead by ~15 delegates tonight. They're happy.
RichLowry	706321961723547648	2016-03-06T03:34:13	With Trump drastically underperforming in every single state today, OH and FL are going to be wild.
RichLowry	706322028081577985	2016-03-06T03:34:28	So how many delegates does it look like Trump and Cruz will get in LA?
RichLowry	706321446444933120	2016-03-06T03:32:10	Cruz w/n 3.6 in KY
RichLowry	706320884584341505	2016-03-06T03:29:56	LA a bit closer w/ 1k precincts still out
RichLowry	706320657638952960	2016-03-06T03:29:02	We always say this kind of thing but it's true: stakes in debate couldn't be higher Rubio
RichLowry	706319519690727424	2016-03-06T03:24:30	SOMETHING hurt Rubio--either the way he hit Trump, or how Trump went after him, or the debate, or all of the above
RichLowry	706318663637471232	2016-03-06T03:21:06	Cruz now down just 4.1 in KY
RichLowry	706318325660434432	2016-03-06T03:19:46	At this rate, Trump won't speak till midnight
RichLowry	706318242772455426	2016-03-06T03:19:26	Yep 
RichLowry	706318148098723840	2016-03-06T03:19:03	Cruz still climbing 
RichLowry	706318014849880065	2016-03-06T03:18:32	Prob too clever, but I wonder if Cruz play in FLA is, in part, meant to pressure Rubio to deal--i.e., agree to be #2 or lose yr hm state
RichLowry	706317389638594560	2016-03-06T03:16:03	Yeah, but beating Trump, not Cruz is the name of the game 
RichLowry	706317180586041346	2016-03-06T03:15:13	No acknowledgement on CNN of closing race in LA
RichLowry	706315572615614464	2016-03-06T03:08:49	Trump's LA lead over Cruz started out at over 25% w/ EVs only. Now it's 6.6% and closing, w/ less than half of precincts in.
RichLowry	706315476134187008	2016-03-06T03:08:26	Trump lead under 7 now in Louisiana, and a lot of votes to go...
RichLowry	706311819116335104	2016-03-06T02:53:54	Clearly something different about election day votes vs early ones. Election day votes show Cruz surging, Trump off some, Rubio way off.
RichLowry	706312620949827584	2016-03-06T02:57:06	14! 
RichLowry	706310466772078593	2016-03-06T02:48:32	Had multiple Louisiana Rs describe Rubio canceling event there this week as "pulling out" of the race there.
RichLowry	706308297339629569	2016-03-06T02:39:55	Trump lead down 7.2 or 5,500 votes or so. Where are you Louisville and Lexington?
RichLowry	706307276601204736	2016-03-06T02:35:51	Trump, on his TrumpU blog, 3/13/08:  “I know Hillary, I think she’d make a great President or Vice President.” 
RichLowry	706308768687112192	2016-03-06T02:41:47	"In total,Donald Trump pocketed $32 mill over nine years,while his public stockholders lost more than $100 mill" 
RichLowry	706304058194317312	2016-03-06T02:23:04	Amazing, Rubio barely beating Kasich in KY

RichLowry	706299473295777792	2016-03-06T02:04:51	On torture, as on legal immigration, Trump's staff knows what he's supposed to think/say, but Trump has different ideas
RichLowry	706299187009339396	2016-03-06T02:03:43	Hard to follow Trump's shifting positions on torture 
RichLowry	706256494673715201	2016-03-05T23:14:04	If you're reporting this as anything other than a huge night for Cruz and a terrible one for Trump, you're doing it wrong.
RichLowry	706297572076355585	2016-03-06T01:57:18	It wasn't good 
RichLowry	706297367012777985	2016-03-06T01:56:29	Imagine where Cruz would be if Trump hadn't stolen so much of his thunder in the South 
RichLowry	706296707642953729	2016-03-06T01:53:52	So Trump loses ME despite LePage endorsement. Which Trump endorser is looking better for having endorsed him?

RichLowry	696179283820158977	2016-02-07T03:50:50	but Kasich probably has the most upside. he may finish 2nd in NH w/ no one ever really having tried to seriously attack him 2/2
RichLowry	696178995021402112	2016-02-07T03:49:41	Trump rocky at times, but no one was going after him; Cruz solid and benefits from Marco's bad night; Jeb, Chrisite, and Kasich all good 1/2
RichLowry	696178545815654405	2016-02-07T03:47:54	Worst night: Rubio.Strong answers later in debate won't erase exchange w/ Christie,which has potential to change narrative of his candidacy

RichLowry	696173066112647169	2016-02-07T03:26:07	Difference here is that in IA the guy running behind Trump (Cruz) wanted to take him down. In NH, neither Rubio or Kasich seem interested
