WilliamShatner	725892305303928832	2016-04-29T03:39:46	No show is perfect but attacking gets you a bad rep why not  open a discussion to show them where they went wrong? 
WilliamShatner	725891203351240704	2016-04-29T03:35:23	The show has other LGBT characters &amp; has had other LGBT storylines. I know you were baited but attacking is wrong 
WilliamShatner	725889515479429121	2016-04-29T03:28:41	You really should look at the facts as to what did and didn't happen. 
WilliamShatner	725887567107739650	2016-04-29T03:20:56	lemonsqueezy? 
WilliamShatner	725885966716555264	2016-04-29T03:14:35	Your attacking is about CLEXA you do have a valid issue but attacking is not going to get your desired outcome 
WilliamShatner	725883996446433281	2016-04-29T03:06:45	I know what CLEXA is about I know you are a minor participant as many within your group have condemned these attacks 
WilliamShatner	725883374053658625	2016-04-29T03:04:17	All you are doing by attacking is making folks not want to open a line of communication with your group.  
WilliamShatner	725880749438586881	2016-04-29T02:53:51	You what's bizarre? CLEXA wants fair &amp; equal treatment but folks like you harass and debase everyone not CLEXA. Why?

WilliamShatner	725532671456071682	2016-04-28T03:50:43	I didn't have a change of heart, always held these views. Perhaps the haters just spin-doctored the perception?

WilliamShatner	725510688299356160	2016-04-28T02:23:22	No, It's two people period. Gender doesn't matter in love. 
WilliamShatner	725510058977562624	2016-04-28T02:20:52	It's short for relationship; who do you want to see in a relationship becomes who you "ship" 
WilliamShatner	725509261011214336	2016-04-28T02:17:41	Only a few of them, it's not the whole SQ ship. Just a few belligerent apples in the bunch. 
WilliamShatner	725508595291299840	2016-04-28T02:15:03	It should be but no, it's a paring nickname like Brangelina, it's Clarke and Lexa  
WilliamShatner	725508199047000064	2016-04-28T02:13:28	You will never know! Mwahaha! 😈

WilliamShatner	725506401112449024	2016-04-28T02:06:19	Nerd_Gym done
WilliamShatner	725504774217469952	2016-04-28T01:59:52	Every fandom has them. It's not unique to any one fandom. 
WilliamShatner	725504400685322241	2016-04-28T01:58:23	I don't tweet a lot of shows anymore as I'm behind on most with my schedule. It's nothing nefarious. 
WilliamShatner	725503274053332994	2016-04-28T01:53:54	Lol! That would be funny. I think everyone can see who the harassment accounts are. 
WilliamShatner	725503070436614144	2016-04-28T01:53:05	I don't think they all were. Some are even still be nasty to me. Ignore the minority of haters and vote. 
WilliamShatner	725502748548947973	2016-04-28T01:51:49	Go into the tweet and report the account for targeted harassment and if enough complain Twitter will take care of it 
WilliamShatner	725498845975568386	2016-04-28T01:36:18	Go away troll account!  
WilliamShatner	725496708877053953	2016-04-28T01:27:49	So now I'm going to ask Outlanders to vote Clarke and Lexa. They won the other bracket. 
WilliamShatner	725496397470953472	2016-04-28T01:26:34	They couldn't afford me. And Sean and I do DM. Most of the folks I follow I DM with. Don't you? 
WilliamShatner	725495866748850176	2016-04-28T01:24:28	Anyone who has been around knows how mean some of the shippers can be. Lots of ships have hater accounts.  
WilliamShatner	725494403473645568	2016-04-28T01:18:39	And I voted CLEXA and Outlander a few times. 
WilliamShatner	725494177685868545	2016-04-28T01:17:45	They are SciFi fans, right? And it's a SciFi show! They will help. 
WilliamShatner	725493623035289600	2016-04-28T01:15:33	Tweet me a reminder and I will plus I'll get folks to help 😉 
WilliamShatner	725493069907255296	2016-04-28T01:13:21	Just wanted to make sure everyone who may follow me saw.  
WilliamShatner	725492654285312004	2016-04-28T01:11:42	Did I also read correctly the Shadowhunters couple is with you in the finals? 
WilliamShatner	725491943430479872	2016-04-28T01:08:52	Nerd_Gym message received. Glad things are happening.  👍🏻
WilliamShatner	725491594640551937	2016-04-28T01:07:29	You know how your fans are; they tracked it down! 😱

WilliamShatner	724354495317041152	2016-04-24T21:49:04	But why attack the actor? Isn't it about the character and the storyline?

WilliamShatner	724350160193486849	2016-04-24T21:31:50	Sean??? Why?  Or is it just because he's an easy mark? 
WilliamShatner	724349754818220033	2016-04-24T21:30:13	Wow that is about as ignorant as their reasons for attacking. So shut up old straight white guy &amp; let them attack?🙄

WilliamShatner	722445051289161728	2016-04-19T15:21:37	dmitchinson kfbk There! I followed! (and then I unfollowed.😜) "I kept my promise"🎤- Evita Peron 😏 
WilliamShatner	722300212799143936	2016-04-19T05:46:05	At least they had Regina mention him... 
WilliamShatner	722299635713200128	2016-04-19T05:43:47	I'm beloved here; you just want to be loved and it ain't working! 
WilliamShatner	722276289189519361	2016-04-19T04:11:01	Beware of falling doors! 🙄 
WilliamShatner	722274764941697024	2016-04-19T04:04:57	Can I bring the Wookiee? 
WilliamShatner	722274561626996737	2016-04-19T04:04:09	Nice! With Dreamy IMBrettDalton and Gorgeous MingNa? 🤗 
WilliamShatner	722274089490976770	2016-04-19T04:02:16	It's not from a star 
WilliamShatner	722272898530938880	2016-04-19T03:57:32	So the fact the actress booked another show has no bearing on this? Just seems like everyone was thrown a curveball. 
WilliamShatner	722272221754892290	2016-04-19T03:54:51	Wait a minute...🤔 
WilliamShatner	722271781805907968	2016-04-19T03:53:06	Isn't it called cosmic dust? 
WilliamShatner	722270933688328192	2016-04-19T03:49:44	She wasn't so evil last night. 
WilliamShatner	722269440717422592	2016-04-19T03:43:48	vPOTUS sounds dirty! 😱😏 
WilliamShatner	722269029734445056	2016-04-19T03:42:10	It will probably be interpreted as an act of war for all I know. 
WilliamShatner	722268714670817280	2016-04-19T03:40:55	That was evil. 
WilliamShatner	722268164105482240	2016-04-19T03:38:44	What did you get? 
WilliamShatner	722267072592420865	2016-04-19T03:34:23	BTW, I will have a signed item from the cwthe100 in my charity auction!
WilliamShatner	722265148048547841	2016-04-19T03:26:44	Oh so should I read between the lines here? The show is renewed so you have nothing to worry about. 
WilliamShatner	722262491439345666	2016-04-19T03:16:11	And how do you affect this change; what are the methods? 
WilliamShatner	722252843420241920	2016-04-19T02:37:51	 
WilliamShatner	722252628537647104	2016-04-19T02:37:00	Yell when it's cheese ball day and I'll say something snarky to Sp8r and not-God! 😘😏 
WilliamShatner	722252323209129984	2016-04-19T02:35:47	And how was the doc? 
WilliamShatner	722251625117536257	2016-04-19T02:33:00	If this were the City of Domes she'd be blinking and running around looking for an ankh! 😱 
WilliamShatner	722251332984307712	2016-04-19T02:31:51	😢 
WilliamShatner	722251231146577922	2016-04-19T02:31:26	BlindspotRoom I saw that spotties!
WilliamShatner	722249869872607232	2016-04-19T02:26:02	And cement and superglue too! 
WilliamShatner	722249498911580160	2016-04-19T02:24:33	I don't see the connection but I'm sure we will come around to the 100 in due course &amp; find a non sequitur argument 
WilliamShatner	722248795480727553	2016-04-19T02:21:46	I know my DVR will record it but I will try. 
WilliamShatner	722248399525773314	2016-04-19T02:20:11	Maybe you're possessed? 😈👻 
WilliamShatner	722247503488266240	2016-04-19T02:16:38	He did it cheaply; a do it yourself Mongolian baboon butt lift!  
WilliamShatner	722199318040449025	2016-04-18T23:05:09	I heard he flew off to exotic parts and had a butt lift...😉🤔 Wait, was I supposed to tell you? 😱 
WilliamShatner	722198877420408832	2016-04-18T23:03:24	BTW have you been to the gishwhes site?
WilliamShatner	722197441827635203	2016-04-18T22:57:42	But doesn't Sasstiel make it a whole lot more special? 😉 
WilliamShatner	722196599976304640	2016-04-18T22:54:21	Well if we don't let him win Claire may spank him again!😱🤔😏😈🖐🏻➡️🍣 ouchie! 😘 
WilliamShatner	722195616227393537	2016-04-18T22:50:27	Yep.😢 If it wasn't for Jared he'd be shopping Stonehenge Apocalypse 5 as a Kickstarter 😘 
WilliamShatner	722184342651338752	2016-04-18T22:05:39	Well you did commandeer a reply to another person, 😱, but I did engage with you. 😉 
WilliamShatner	722100784683294721	2016-04-18T16:33:37	I am unable to make it. I'm sure we will see each other soon. Let me know what you think of the doc; haven't seen it 
WilliamShatner	722099246623633408	2016-04-18T16:27:31	Excuse the newbie. He doesn't know how to link! 🙄  
WilliamShatner	722098340209373184	2016-04-18T16:23:54	sean_m_maguire 🎂🎊🎉 Welcome to Middle Age! 😘👴🏻
WilliamShatner	722096165534052353	2016-04-18T16:15:16	roccodispirito Rocco! How are you?
WilliamShatner	722084837801246720	2016-04-18T15:30:15	Meet WilliamShatner &amp; have him sign a limited edition fine art print, this Sat. 12:30-2:00. Tickets required: 
WilliamShatner	722071308746358785	2016-04-18T14:36:30	You and I have different definitions of what is an attack. 🙄 
WilliamShatner	722068973148176389	2016-04-18T14:27:13	Attacking is not "standing up" it's  attacking and it's sending a message you probably don't want sent. 
WilliamShatner	722066938990452736	2016-04-18T14:19:08	Expressing feelings is fine but it's turned to personal attacks. Folks think that helps but it's hurting the cause. 
WilliamShatner	722061793556717570	2016-04-18T13:58:41	Narrow minded people are going to hate anything that goes against their beliefs. Don't let it affect you.  
WilliamShatner	722058461207334912	2016-04-18T13:45:27	reallycb 💋❗️
WilliamShatner	722056212695486464	2016-04-18T13:36:30	Not quite sure where you got religion or judgmental from. 🤔  
WilliamShatner	721944484682948609	2016-04-18T06:12:32	As I pointed out earlier a number of the folks attacking the network claim to be foreign so no constitution in play 
WilliamShatner	721943657494945793	2016-04-18T06:09:15	Supposedly she is the season finale according to some fan sites. So who knows??? 
WilliamShatner	721940555849052160	2016-04-18T05:56:56	What about last season when Lexa kissed Clarke?  Was that over sexualized? 
WilliamShatner	721938739082059776	2016-04-18T05:49:43	Why are you commenting on me getting attacked for a tweet about love? I could say to follow your own advice. 
WilliamShatner	721937257398054912	2016-04-18T05:43:49	Lol! I got attacked b/c folks have a right to be upset over an issue I wasn't even tweeting about. That's what! 
WilliamShatner	721936335515164672	2016-04-18T05:40:09	SteveGonsalves1 I can't even imagine how you are involved in this. 😉
WilliamShatner	721936031935664128	2016-04-18T05:38:57	And what about Clarke? What about Niylah? They don't count? 
WilliamShatner	721934959234015232	2016-04-18T05:34:41	Be angry all you want. That doesn't give you license to attack, does it?  
WilliamShatner	721934038450053121	2016-04-18T05:31:02	I read it earlier. So that gives you the right to attack me for this tweet??:  
WilliamShatner	721932910094262272	2016-04-18T05:26:33	Haha! I got attacked over a tweet having zero to do with LGBT but I can't say anything? 🙄 
WilliamShatner	721931782279405569	2016-04-18T05:22:04	I'm pretty sure that attacking people over the death of a fictional character where the actor got another role is 👎🏻 
WilliamShatner	721931226685157377	2016-04-18T05:19:51	Not in Baldwin Park 
WilliamShatner	721930770084864001	2016-04-18T05:18:03	It's not until tomorrow. Coincidentally the same date as Paul Revere's ride: "The British Are Coming!" 
WilliamShatner	721930336473468928	2016-04-18T05:16:19	Twice as much as he got me! I'm so generous! 😘 
WilliamShatner	721929975717203968	2016-04-18T05:14:53	# is the hashtag for live tweeting 🙄 
WilliamShatner	721928469211258880	2016-04-18T05:08:54	Umm 5'9" 
WilliamShatner	721928138213580800	2016-04-18T05:07:35	Oh? They must be letting everyone in now! 🙄😘 
WilliamShatner	721925946836520960	2016-04-18T04:58:53	GoodWitch A new love interest?

WilliamShatner	721911305217552388	2016-04-18T04:00:42	GoodWitch Ok let's see what happens
WilliamShatner	721910634988711936	2016-04-18T03:58:02	In OUAT Red Riding Hood is in love with Dorothy Gale of Kansas and kissed her with true love's kiss breaking a curse. A happily ever after!
WilliamShatner	721896460380299265	2016-04-18T03:01:42	Look at any show with relationships. Baiting happens all the time on Soaps.  
WilliamShatner	721896078803492864	2016-04-18T03:00:12	Are we actually going to count? There's the Space Station victims. Mt Weather, innumerable grounders.... 
WilliamShatner	721894638290735105	2016-04-18T02:54:28	Clarke is a female 
WilliamShatner	721894283033227264	2016-04-18T02:53:03	Didn't Lexa die taking a bullet meant for Clarke?  
WilliamShatner	721893564913819650	2016-04-18T02:50:12	Happily ever after a rarely happen on TV no matter what sexual preference.
WilliamShatner	721893150747262977	2016-04-18T02:48:33	You are watching a SciFi show. Have you watched Walking Dead? People get killed and tortured all the time. 
WilliamShatner	721888459497934849	2016-04-18T02:29:55	All you have to do is look at soaps. No lead ever settles down-always probs. It's how life is portrayed on screen.  
WilliamShatner	721887279409528832	2016-04-18T02:25:14	Video game creators cannot create successful female character games so therefore it must be misogyny? 
WilliamShatner	721886127926284289	2016-04-18T02:20:39	And Finn died too before Lexa. And the B in LGBT stands for??? 
WilliamShatner	721883927539888128	2016-04-18T02:11:54	What is Clarke's character? Not the lead?  
WilliamShatner	721882803353161732	2016-04-18T02:07:26	I have read it. I knew most of this information &amp; I knew about the wonderful outpouring of $ for the Trevor Project. 
WilliamShatner	721880154155446272	2016-04-18T01:56:55	How is this manipulation if you knew the actress went to another show? Maybe another storyline is coming?  
WilliamShatner	721879516847738880	2016-04-18T01:54:23	You don't have to take it but I got attacked for a comment made to Stephen King. What does that have to do w/ you?  
WilliamShatner	721878770253082624	2016-04-18T01:51:25	You knew she was going to leave, they killed the character off. How do you know LGBT storylines are dead on the 100? 
WilliamShatner	721877252355403776	2016-04-18T01:45:23	I wouldn't miss your premiere! And I'd love to! 
WilliamShatner	721876405068242944	2016-04-18T01:42:01	You can search for the story behind it. We were clever about what we did. 
WilliamShatner	721875688681148416	2016-04-18T01:39:10	9pm PT 
WilliamShatner	721875563980267520	2016-04-18T01:38:40	So social media terrorism is what you advocate? Just trying to get you to see this method is not doing you any good 
WilliamShatner	721874577001873408	2016-04-18T01:34:45	So be rude to get your message out there to everyone?  
WilliamShatner	721874039958933505	2016-04-18T01:32:37	But I'm not anyone that can do anything about it so you just want to disrupt everyone until you get your way? 
WilliamShatner	721873127521722368	2016-04-18T01:29:00	If they have a concern they feel is legitimate, then open a discussion with TPTB. Don't attack; U won't get anywhere 
WilliamShatner	721871991402135552	2016-04-18T01:24:29	You get more flies with honey than vinegar. It's not the message that is the problem; it's the delivery.  
WilliamShatner	721871239740923906	2016-04-18T01:21:29	So you only watch the LGBT characters? How do you understand the plot when they all interact? 
WilliamShatner	721870444907724800	2016-04-18T01:18:20	Oh look it's Essex boy! How many minutes are you on tonight? Maybe I can watch it live without fast forwarding! 😘 
WilliamShatner	721869949338128384	2016-04-18T01:16:22	Well there wouldn't be any sock puppet accounts attacking. 🙄 
WilliamShatner	721868077260902400	2016-04-18T01:08:55	Considering the backlash if a character arc runs it's course or is killed; is it? Seems like it's less of a headache 
WilliamShatner	721867515706478593	2016-04-18T01:06:42	The observation was that many of these accounts are attacking the CW network which is a US network. 
WilliamShatner	721829530839584768	2016-04-17T22:35:45	I'll be back later. Hold off your raging until then.
WilliamShatner	721829400384147456	2016-04-17T22:35:14	One observation I'll make about this LGBT/100 issue is that most of the arguing accounts have bio indicating they are non-US. Interesting.
WilliamShatner	721825568962912256	2016-04-17T22:20:01	All wee and good but in a show about conflict and survival it's kind of hard as well I'm sure. 
WilliamShatner	721824778089209857	2016-04-17T22:16:52	And way to go to alienate people! 👍🏻 
WilliamShatner	721824037484122112	2016-04-17T22:13:56	We had our role but we didn't do it single handedly.   
WilliamShatner	721823281330802688	2016-04-17T22:10:55	If that's the plan then you need titanium ones to deal with the public outcries. 
WilliamShatner	721822972349054976	2016-04-17T22:09:42	Fantastic on the money👍🏻 it's a shame it took a character's death to raise it. You don't control; you can affect. 
WilliamShatner	721822480340353024	2016-04-17T22:07:44	Well I wouldn't be where I am today but I also wouldn't be on social media debasing the production company either. 
WilliamShatner	721820440360931328	2016-04-17T21:59:38	With all the meddling she does she found time for that? 🙄 
WilliamShatner	721820224970817537	2016-04-17T21:58:47	No but I think the methods of your protest are leaning towards that eventuality There are good &amp; bad ways to protest 
WilliamShatner	721819262726201345	2016-04-17T21:54:57	What if the 100 were to say, we hear you and we won't put on anymore LGBT characters? Did you win or lose? 
WilliamShatner	721817594949316608	2016-04-17T21:48:20	Rec'd this. Several of these shows are not US productions so the issue is worldwide. Is attacking 1 show the answer? 
WilliamShatner	721815377106198528	2016-04-17T21:39:31	So is the message you want to send is don't put an LGBT character on if they are going to be killed off in a bad way 
WilliamShatner	721812939024388097	2016-04-17T21:29:49	One beloved character dies, do you think that will be the end of LGBT?  
WilliamShatner	721812644659748865	2016-04-17T21:28:39	And you may have heard what we went through to get that done. And Star Trek was preempted in the South for that ep. 
WilliamShatner	721811828360085504	2016-04-17T21:25:25	Things are hardly perfect but at least they had the b*lls to put an LGBT character on. Would you rather they hadn't? 
WilliamShatner	721810537021972481	2016-04-17T21:20:17	I need CC on for some Scottish shows.

WilliamShatner	719199647185502208	2016-04-10T16:25:32	It'd be quite the accomplishment for a fan to ask Terry to pose w/her boarding pass today to prove this. She's real. 
WilliamShatner	719181273684508672	2016-04-10T15:12:32	You spend the week picking it apart &amp; saying how dreamy Sam and Caitriona were and then it's on again. Then repeat.🙄

WilliamShatner	719169727306674180	2016-04-10T14:26:39	.ImMici Lots of ways to prove. Selfie with nickname, colleagues can verify, isn't she on Renegades?, I'm skeptical due to Nerium link.

WilliamShatner	718973850289983488	2016-04-10T01:28:18	Are you insinuating that, like you, I look like a dog? 👿  
WilliamShatner	718973386379042816	2016-04-10T01:26:27	Why isn't there a drama queen emoji? 😏

WilliamShatner	718172120874749952	2016-04-07T20:22:31	You have it wrong. Mom attacked, daughter defended. It was about targeting Cortney's friends. Nothing else. 
WilliamShatner	718170966740701186	2016-04-07T20:17:56	Cortney's acquaintances who I don't know are being attacked through me. 
WilliamShatner	718169910149402624	2016-04-07T20:13:44	Not only do I believe it: it's what really happened.  
WilliamShatner	718168822046306304	2016-04-07T20:09:24	The childish mindset is keep attacking until he shuts up and then we can claim victory. 
WilliamShatner	718167920581292032	2016-04-07T20:05:49	No. She came to defend her mother's attack yesterday. That's condoning in any definition. 
WilliamShatner	718166585731461120	2016-04-07T20:00:31	She is; so how do you defend those actions and stay on a moral high ground? You cannot. QED 
WilliamShatner	718165885291114496	2016-04-07T19:57:44	So if she condones her mother's actions &amp; she runs the antibullying account then don't you think there's a problem? 
WilliamShatner	718165403730481152	2016-04-07T19:55:49	No, worse. The person on my team is a supposed friend of folks they have targeted as those "possibly responsible" 
WilliamShatner	718163702940172288	2016-04-07T19:49:04	Look at her tweets. She defended her mom &amp; said I called her a hater conveniently forgetting her mom called me that. 
WilliamShatner	718162343272710145	2016-04-07T19:43:40	I like the word hellatus. 👍🏻

WilliamShatner	718161038277881856	2016-04-07T19:38:28	What do you mean? It's bizarre!

WilliamShatner	718129698442600448	2016-04-07T17:33:56	The mother did her attack and blocked me. Emily was just blocked today so spare me the rhetoric on what I've done. 
WilliamShatner	718128966867902464	2016-04-07T17:31:02	Mediating? I got attacked and the person who defended the attacker runs the antibullying Acct. How am I mediating? 
WilliamShatner	718128603943141376	2016-04-07T17:29:36	I was explaining SeaCon 2016. She interjected saying I'd never believe the truth as I knew a mem of the hater crew  
WilliamShatner	718128019781464064	2016-04-07T17:27:16	Well the mother thinks I have a member of the "hater crew" on my Gishwhes team.  They must think they know something 
WilliamShatner	718123374170361856	2016-04-07T17:08:49	If EVERYONE recognizes that why did mommy attack when I was mentioning SeaCon 2016 2 days ago? Isn't it old news? 
WilliamShatner	718121992579211265	2016-04-07T17:03:19	Fine, so why continue the vendetta? The mother attacked me 2 days ago about this when I was tweeting @ SeaCon. 
WilliamShatner	718118128371105792	2016-04-07T16:47:58	And then harassed the person who reported her trying to get him fired from what was told to me. 
WilliamShatner	718117781489655808	2016-04-07T16:46:35	Also, they harassed the person for nearly 2 years who reported Emily &amp; was just trying to protect the safety of J&amp;J  
WilliamShatner	718116639363829761	2016-04-07T16:42:03	Nothing at all to do with Emily. She was apparently ejected from another con because she was accused.  
WilliamShatner	718114194931855360	2016-04-07T16:32:20	Then find someone who doesn't have a personal vindictive agenda to run it.  
WilliamShatner	718113495833645056	2016-04-07T16:29:33	I tweeted about SeaCon and what was reported on Twitter was that there was an attempt made and that never happened. 
WilliamShatner	718112899919523840	2016-04-07T16:27:11	If the person who runs the account defends bullying when it's in her interest, then something is VERY wrong.  
WilliamShatner	718112385584660480	2016-04-07T16:25:09	Like Emily did when she said I called her mom a hater because of an issue with a friend of a friend? Very adult. 
WilliamShatner	718111985473167361	2016-04-07T16:23:33	It started with her mom who attacked me. Emily came to defend the attack. I also find she runs the bullying Acct.  
WilliamShatner	718110677731115008	2016-04-07T16:18:22	As long as folks know what they are doing. I've blocked both mother and daughter. 
WilliamShatner	718110270992678913	2016-04-07T16:16:45	I will make sure that folks know  the SPNAntiBullying account also has an agenda to punish innocent people. Beware of this account.
WilliamShatner	718109462792278016	2016-04-07T16:13:32	🙄 So it's OK to bully an innocent party whose friend of a friend supposedly got you kicked out of a con?  
WilliamShatner	718107616505761792	2016-04-07T16:06:12	I can't work under those conditions. I'm calling my agent.  
WilliamShatner	718107015164203008	2016-04-07T16:03:48	Your mother attacked me, you came &amp; supported her. I then find out you run the antibullying account. Malign much?

WilliamShatner	718101481467940864	2016-04-07T15:41:49	I heard. It's sad; her mom attacked me too. I hope that folks investigate &amp; not take just the accts word on things.😢

WilliamShatner	717558850530844673	2016-04-06T03:45:36	He told me his name. 
WilliamShatner	717558691688361986	2016-04-06T03:44:58	Marcia Cross does get cray roles but I'm thinking that it has to be someone who is familiar with Quantico 
WilliamShatner	717558039197327360	2016-04-06T03:42:22	I haven't asked them yet. 
WilliamShatner	717557380511182848	2016-04-06T03:39:45	😱 The black moon clan is coming; call Sailor Moon! 😉 
WilliamShatner	717555940703141888	2016-04-06T03:34:02	👍🏻 I think her father is involved as well. 
WilliamShatner	717555572946522114	2016-04-06T03:32:34	So my thoughts on who is behind the creepy phone calls on QuanticoTV is Ryan. It's been a set up since the beginning.
WilliamShatner	717554014859038720	2016-04-06T03:26:23	His dreamy Boston accent isn't enough to win you over?

WilliamShatner	717536222202040320	2016-04-06T02:15:41	Sam is promising a signed item from the show. He is retuning to Scotland and will let me know.
WilliamShatner	717535466082344960	2016-04-06T02:12:40	He tried to donate his horse but a tear started welling up in his eye and I knew I couldn't take Sleepy from him.😱 
WilliamShatner	717534362472833024	2016-04-06T02:08:17	Why do ghosts have clothes? The ReevesStevens have the answer in their new book: Wraith! Watch:  👍🏻 I love it!

WilliamShatner	717533236864266240	2016-04-06T02:03:49	Probably will be needing some volunteers: volunteersHCHS@yahoo.com is the email address. The event is 6/4 in Burbank 
WilliamShatner	717532533622067200	2016-04-06T02:01:01	Sam signed those 2 
WilliamShatner	717532464982335489	2016-04-06T02:00:45	Nobody wants my grubby hands on those books. 😉 
WilliamShatner	717532205367463936	2016-04-06T01:59:43	Drums and Echo are signed by Sam 
WilliamShatner	717531886256402435	2016-04-06T01:58:27	They are all going into my charity auction. 
WilliamShatner	717531772968239104	2016-04-06T01:58:00	We will eventually meet. That I am sure of.

WilliamShatner	717529871790972928	2016-04-06T01:50:27	He also signed Echo in the Bone.
WilliamShatner	717528456389472257	2016-04-06T01:44:49	He has promised something from the set once he gets back but I did get this for my auction. 
WilliamShatner	717527913910784001	2016-04-06T01:42:40	I didn't think he was going to tell anyone. I told Diana we had dinner but said nothing publicly. That's why I was vague last week.
WilliamShatner	717527273625137152	2016-04-06T01:40:07	He didn't wear a kilt. 🙄🙏🏻 I think he was a bit overwhelmed at first but he got more comfortable as the meal went on.
WilliamShatner	717526244426784768	2016-04-06T01:36:02	Maybe... 
WilliamShatner	717525141006082048	2016-04-06T01:31:39	👍🏻 
WilliamShatner	717524461801451520	2016-04-06T01:28:57	😏 
WilliamShatner	717398858553118720	2016-04-05T17:09:51	And I said what she did to me- attacking b/c of guilt by 3rd party association- is childish and you reprimanded me. 
WilliamShatner	717398062738440193	2016-04-05T17:06:41	It does not explain attacking me, does it? Isn't that what this convo is about? 
WilliamShatner	717397036627136515	2016-04-05T17:02:36	I never thought you were Amanda. 
WilliamShatner	717396843856986112	2016-04-05T17:01:50	So I have a right to attack an innocent party who is friends with someone who is friends of some one I blame? 😳🤔🙄 
WilliamShatner	717395832589266944	2016-04-05T16:57:49	And she attacked me due to an association and then blocked me. Is that not childish and immature? It is what it is. 
WilliamShatner	717395049172971520	2016-04-05T16:54:42	Why be mad at me? Seems a little immature for someone in her 60's. Whatever the case; it happened and we move on.

WilliamShatner	717383300956860416	2016-04-05T16:08:01	Guess this is her mother:  She tweeted that &amp; blocked me. Folks who hate haters are haters 
WilliamShatner	717380907993202688	2016-04-05T15:58:31	I do know the story. My guess is none of us know the whole story.  
WilliamShatner	717376612392538112	2016-04-05T15:41:27	RD Version: it isn't about Destiel but it really is at times &amp; I don't belong in this fandom b/c of whatever reason😱 
WilliamShatner	717374745998598145	2016-04-05T15:34:02	And another country is heard from!  
WilliamShatner	717374505333559297	2016-04-05T15:33:04	There were no chains involved 
WilliamShatner	717374322109591552	2016-04-05T15:32:21	All year long from what I hear.

WilliamShatner	717373916881096704	2016-04-05T15:30:44	It's more effective this way😏 
WilliamShatner	717373654506471424	2016-04-05T15:29:42	As long as she doesn't disparage others via association because she has a disagreement with another person I'm fine. 
WilliamShatner	717373168701210625	2016-04-05T15:27:46	Happy First Contact Day! Here was my first contact day a few years ago! 😘 
WilliamShatner	717372397955915777	2016-04-05T15:24:42	Disagreements happen all the time. That is why you and she have blocked each other. She does not influence me.  
WilliamShatner	717369415403081728	2016-04-05T15:12:51	I think you know exactly what you are doing. I will not stand for you trying to disparage my team because of hatred

WilliamShatner	717366905321840640	2016-04-05T15:02:52	Who she associates with does not make her a hater. Besides I've known Misha longer than I've known her. 
WilliamShatner	717365692387823617	2016-04-05T14:58:03	She's not a hater, though. That's what it comes down to. She may not be popular with a certain group but that's all 
WilliamShatner	717364367377825792	2016-04-05T14:52:47	He sees it and he laughs. Remember those online are a fraction of the real fanbase total. 
WilliamShatner	717363883233583105	2016-04-05T14:50:52	Are they fans of the show or fans of the haters? There is this invention called Google that can be used to verify it 
WilliamShatner	717362548639596544	2016-04-05T14:45:34	Honestly, what could she possibly do? Tell me to hate Misha? Everyone knows better than that. 
WilliamShatner	717361987542331393	2016-04-05T14:43:20	He makes plenty of $, he would never steal from a charity. 
WilliamShatner	717361563607281665	2016-04-05T14:41:39	I think she saw it as Misha "meddling" and Jared being left out. She did have a photo op with the 4 after that. 
WilliamShatner	717360744996610053	2016-04-05T14:38:24	His take has been: don't worry about what's happening right now; in 5 minutes they will be on to something else.👍🏻 
WilliamShatner	717360027644723202	2016-04-05T14:35:33	I've seen her photos wearing the cupcake apron with cupcake cream on their faces being adorbs. Definitely hatred! 🙄 
WilliamShatner	717359024459546624	2016-04-05T14:31:33	Boo makes popcorn and sits by laughing maniacally. Love him, or hate him, he loves the attention! 😘 
WilliamShatner	717357801815683072	2016-04-05T14:26:42	Honestly even if she hates Misha -which she has multiple photo ops of him that say otherwise- what can she do @ it? 
WilliamShatner	717357315226112000	2016-04-05T14:24:46	Look at Emily's tweets to Hann23 where she's telling her how we all must hate Misha &amp; Hann believes it; that's &gt;1 
WilliamShatner	717356636692611072	2016-04-05T14:22:04	You can't make this stuff up, though. If I were to tell people about this they'd assume it was fiction. 
WilliamShatner	717356241949818880	2016-04-05T14:20:30	I'd like a concrete example of what I've done to change things except convincing a few stars of shows to stay here. 
WilliamShatner	717355923673513985	2016-04-05T14:19:14	You may be mature but did you see her convo with Hann23? I hate Misha yet I support Gishwhes??? That is stupidity. 
WilliamShatner	717355165292957696	2016-04-05T14:16:13	Just another part of the craziness of fandoms. You don't shop what I ship; you are dead to me! 
WilliamShatner	717354854834765824	2016-04-05T14:14:59	I realized that this is about Destiel. It still comes down to either choose Destiel or be lied about. Right? 
WilliamShatner	717354376432525312	2016-04-05T14:13:05	Of course I should! Especially where fans are suggesting that because I don't ship what they do that they lie @ me 
WilliamShatner	717353652730462213	2016-04-05T14:10:13	🙄 Why would I associate with Misha if I hated him? This is where the craziness of the fandom &amp; reality diverge 
WilliamShatner	717352541684523009	2016-04-05T14:05:48	Do you? The fan from yesterday seems to because of who I have on my GW team. She told me off &amp;blocked me 
WilliamShatner	717351597001433088	2016-04-05T14:02:03	Doesn't this issue just boil down to Destiel? You ship it, she won't?  
WilliamShatner	717348886331797505	2016-04-05T13:51:16	Looks like Botox or an eye lift. 😏😈 
WilliamShatner	717232337138921472	2016-04-05T06:08:09	How do you get the guy then? 
WilliamShatner	717231449385144320	2016-04-05T06:04:37	MacGuyver of course 
WilliamShatner	717229081323036672	2016-04-05T05:55:13	Milk 
WilliamShatner	717227721110200320	2016-04-05T05:49:48	I'd only switch for cookies and I'd stay only until the ilk ran out. 
WilliamShatner	717226389364154369	2016-04-05T05:44:31	I thought I was TeamCap 🤔 
WilliamShatner	717225606711263232	2016-04-05T05:41:24	I pushed it and Twitter was over 60% of the battery usage! 😱 obsessivecompulsion 
WilliamShatner	717223272790810624	2016-04-05T05:32:08	Yep but drama is what fills lonely lives. 🙄 
WilliamShatner	717217688435695617	2016-04-05T05:09:56	GiveDotMobi No.
WilliamShatner	717216215865954304	2016-04-05T05:04:05	I think it's about the group of "fans" who don't want a certain angel on a certain show. 
WilliamShatner	717215150323941377	2016-04-05T04:59:51	Sounds like someone is a member of the real hater crew. 
WilliamShatner	717175790215892992	2016-04-05T02:23:27	Back later
WilliamShatner	717173210727391232	2016-04-05T02:13:12	Jealousy drives fans cuckoo. Always has. 
WilliamShatner	717171282022768641	2016-04-05T02:05:32	I always hear about folks trying to get others thrown out of the SPN cons. Happened to one of my GW team members  
WilliamShatner	717170501760655360	2016-04-05T02:02:26	🙄 as we were just saying; fans spinning crazy stuff... 
WilliamShatner	717169882832318464	2016-04-05T01:59:59	You have to look at the big picture. Certain fans want attention. How do you tell fan craziness from real psychos?  
WilliamShatner	717169275815890949	2016-04-05T01:57:34	You had to be there for the comment 
WilliamShatner	717168533633785856	2016-04-05T01:54:37	There was even a Gishwhes task last year about my little ponies. 
WilliamShatner	717167433576939521	2016-04-05T01:50:15	It was all about what was going on at the con but a lot was conjecture and fan spinning as to what was happening 
WilliamShatner	717166784747442176	2016-04-05T01:47:40	It may be the snowball that starts an avalanche. 
WilliamShatner	717166335508111360	2016-04-05T01:45:53	Steve_Gatlin 🎂🎉🎊🍾👍🏻
WilliamShatner	717165948436815872	2016-04-05T01:44:21	I was online that day and reports being given to me were threats, she had box cutters and attempts were made. 
WilliamShatner	717165397816909824	2016-04-05T01:42:09	I'm a brony. 
WilliamShatner	717164604325933057	2016-04-05T01:39:00	🙄Since you are already in Milwaukee I'd suggest you ring up the President and have him swing by and pick you up. 
WilliamShatner	717162454564741120	2016-04-05T01:30:28	Depends if you want to meet actors and have a photo taken or are just content with watching a show. 
WilliamShatner	717160226143645699	2016-04-05T01:21:36	Fandoms don't realize what a gift con promoters are. They bring you your idols. That's why I tell you to thank them 
WilliamShatner	717158822540742657	2016-04-05T01:16:02	Cons are good for fans but there are always bad pennies in everything. 
WilliamShatner	717157118877368320	2016-04-05T01:09:15	It's the hubris of the fanbase. They are but a slice of the actual number of fans. 
WilliamShatner	717155210972438529	2016-04-05T01:01:41	That may have been overblown. Someone made threats, someone defiantly showed up but nothing happened. 
WilliamShatner	717153175631826944	2016-04-05T00:53:35	Welcome to fandoms where folks think they own and can control the actors, the show, etc... 
WilliamShatner	717152217027883008	2016-04-05T00:49:47	Is it peer pressure or are they loners? I've seen fans who tried to get actors fired b/c they want different ships 
WilliamShatner	717146617611034624	2016-04-05T00:27:32	When it crosses a line authorities need to be called in.   
WilliamShatner	717146224449576960	2016-04-05T00:25:58	I've seen bizarre behavior from the 60+ set that rivals the little kids. 
WilliamShatner	717145894953463809	2016-04-05T00:24:39	No, you can be totally involved in your show but still understand it's just a show. 
WilliamShatner	717145566413660164	2016-04-05T00:23:21	They are one of the longest obsessed fanbases but I've seen horrible things in other fandoms.  
WilliamShatner	717145101718265856	2016-04-05T00:21:30	It's not even that; it's the inability to separate reality from fiction (which shows how good the actors are.) 
WilliamShatner	717144251507671040	2016-04-05T00:18:08	I have my big feet in many fandoms and while fanaticism is OK in moderation; folks do get carried away.
WilliamShatner	717143922821050368	2016-04-05T00:16:49	It wasn't a bad tweet. Here's what it said: "To be fair, I think any death threat from any situation is crossing the line."
WilliamShatner	717143125307760640	2016-04-05T00:13:39	True, there is a certain subset of that fandom that wants the leads to get married IRL. That may be the root of this 
WilliamShatner	717141957202411520	2016-04-05T00:09:01	Reading in the tabloids about an actress who is getting death threats from a fan about her and her fam. That's where fandoms cross the line.
WilliamShatner	717140623455690752	2016-04-05T00:03:43	No, I'm a badass 
WilliamShatner	717134504087826432	2016-04-04T23:39:24	🙄 
WilliamShatner	717132371049328640	2016-04-04T23:30:55	Technology must befuddle him that's why he works in the 18th Century. 
WilliamShatner	717131939811962880	2016-04-04T23:29:12	Story on my cars I'm putting up for auction:  
WilliamShatner	717131230022467584	2016-04-04T23:26:23	Are we in repeat mode on the Outlander event?
WilliamShatner	717127228769701888	2016-04-04T23:10:29	And Jared previously assisted in many ways including the spreadsheet task! 
WilliamShatner	717125060914352129	2016-04-04T23:01:52	And Sam is still disappointing people on the red carpet. Love it!
WilliamShatner	717124541806354433	2016-04-04T22:59:48	Blocked and reported 
WilliamShatner	717122953389805568	2016-04-04T22:53:30	Look at her dress

WilliamShatner	717122457723768833	2016-04-04T22:51:32	How do you think I knew his name? 🙄 
WilliamShatner	717122254002257921	2016-04-04T22:50:43	cbctom Thank you for letting me know

WilliamShatner	717121046659227648	2016-04-04T22:45:55	Is this Frank?
WilliamShatner	717120994981203968	2016-04-04T22:45:43	I wasn't  
WilliamShatner	717120590952292352	2016-04-04T22:44:06	I'll let you know when I see it 
WilliamShatner	717119574223622145	2016-04-04T22:40:04	This is like voyeurism at its worst!
WilliamShatner	717118905001451520	2016-04-04T22:37:25	We have people from all over the world...we have Portland Oregon...we have the Bronx... 🙄
WilliamShatner	717118295975931904	2016-04-04T22:34:59	And who is she? Fish out of water here. 
WilliamShatner	717118068665618432	2016-04-04T22:34:05	We are in the disdain stage 
WilliamShatner	717117915212828672	2016-04-04T22:33:29	So I took a peek at the Outlander premiere and it's...umm different. I saw RonDMoore 👍🏻  I don't have a clue who is up now.
WilliamShatner	717115743607726080	2016-04-04T22:24:51	Of Boo tirades? Yes 
WilliamShatner	717115350559526914	2016-04-04T22:23:17	Is this the Facebook stream thing? 
WilliamShatner	717113881072525312	2016-04-04T22:17:27	😴💤💤💤💤 
WilliamShatner	717113502066823168	2016-04-04T22:15:56	They have a late lunch on Mondays and he's obviously hungry. 
WilliamShatner	717113271602417664	2016-04-04T22:15:01	Correction: He's the Hamburger Helper person who is not very helpful...but he's weird. 🤓 
WilliamShatner	717112771108675584	2016-04-04T22:13:02	Here's how Boo went to Mars! Tried to get him into an astronaut helmet or flight jacket but once he had these on 🙄 
WilliamShatner	717111588084326400	2016-04-04T22:08:20	Heard you went to Mars. I did ask to send you to the ISS but they said it would be a waste of taxpayer money. 🙄 
WilliamShatner	717024353578131456	2016-04-04T16:21:42	Only because you have a cute kid, otherwise 🚫😘

WilliamShatner	717022947005718528	2016-04-04T16:16:06	It's my weekend job! 
WilliamShatner	717022449389309952	2016-04-04T16:14:08	🙄 You two should get married! You are perfect for each other! 👍🏻 
WilliamShatner	717021055261388800	2016-04-04T16:08:35	Wonderful. I am well, thank you. Send my best to the shrub puller as well. 
WilliamShatner	717020740092964864	2016-04-04T16:07:20	So you use your craft to disparage &amp; debase another's craft in the hopes that the whole world will talk about it? 👏🏻 
WilliamShatner	717018654877966337	2016-04-04T15:59:03	Give press an cm* and they'll take a meter*. *internationalized 
WilliamShatner	717014771900424193	2016-04-04T15:43:37	Who would make Kansas fictional? That would be a waste of time. BTW the bike was Miss Gulch's not Dorothy's. 😱 
WilliamShatner	717014103777103872	2016-04-04T15:40:58	Make sure you add that to your resume! 😱😜 How are you my friend? 
WilliamShatner	717013281307697153	2016-04-04T15:37:42	And another non-literary!  
WilliamShatner	717013084372471809	2016-04-04T15:36:55	Wow, someone doesn't read. Dorothy had silver slippers. MGM made them ruby because of the advent of color film. 
WilliamShatner	717012700522393604	2016-04-04T15:35:23	The crazy Italian guy who has the pompous British nutball and farm boy billymflynn for sons? He left the show?😱 
WilliamShatner	717007394824257536	2016-04-04T15:14:18	It's the press. Being in the UK, you of all people should know: they have no souls. Are they redeemable? 🙄🤔🚫 
WilliamShatner	717006212290576384	2016-04-04T15:09:36	Random thought: So if Dorothy's Silver Slippers can create a portal why didn't anyone who got trapped outside of Storybrook just go to KS?
WilliamShatner	717004916099653632	2016-04-04T15:04:27	Awwww...🍭 Here's a lolly. Here in the US they are also called suckers! Fitting given the circumstances? 😘😉

WilliamShatner	716848901857222657	2016-04-04T04:44:31	Isn't that a fandom's job to froth nothing into mounds of conjecture that gets turned into mountains of fake facts?

WilliamShatner	716819991325114369	2016-04-04T02:49:38	The trailer gives it all away. My theory is that messing with the future produces a mean Frank.

WilliamShatner	713380853393465345	2016-03-25T15:03:44	I'm convinced that cereals like Trix are what brought smoothies into popularity with Gen X. Fruit flavored milk! 🙄

WilliamShatner	713367222165463041	2016-03-25T14:09:34	LOL so why bother pointing things out to me when you just proved the point I made about her stirring her followers? 
WilliamShatner	713365584239407104	2016-03-25T14:03:03	And that's why you decided to follow me and still do?

WilliamShatner	713357652508545024	2016-03-25T13:31:32	Why is it that many millennials can't bother to understand an issue before offering up their obtuse opinion? 
WilliamShatner	713253759380402177	2016-03-25T06:38:42	Doesn't matter what their age; to invoke that to try to win shows an immaturity level beyond contempt. 
WilliamShatner	713252930065858561	2016-03-25T06:35:24	Did you just say to be fair?  Two tweets with me tagged isn't contact? 
WilliamShatner	713252186843512832	2016-03-25T06:32:27	It's the first defense of little bully girls; yell misogyny!  
WilliamShatner	713250471876501504	2016-03-25T06:25:38	Well she proved the theory. She's blocked and in 18 months she can play victim too saying she never contacted me 
WilliamShatner	713247472399753217	2016-03-25T06:13:43	Let's just make this misogynistic because a male blocks a female. You have the search tool-search before condemning

WilliamShatner	711389907340505089	2016-03-20T03:12:25	So they could continue to play injured party and call me a thief? No thank you! 
WilliamShatner	711389685281480705	2016-03-20T03:11:32	Yes they did. stupidmove 
WilliamShatner	711389283580424192	2016-03-20T03:09:56	Of course! Shame they are on hiatus.

WilliamShatner	711388399127531520	2016-03-20T03:06:25	Here's the rub: Sam is their Grand Marshall. Do you think they would be that silly? 🤔 
WilliamShatner	711388060320014338	2016-03-20T03:05:05	Thank you

WilliamShatner	711386036635455488	2016-03-20T02:57:02	No OutlanderHQ did not. They are good people. Go back in my tweets if you are curious. 
WilliamShatner	711385039313842177	2016-03-20T02:53:04	Is be careful about using this photo without credit... 
WilliamShatner	711378860382617601	2016-03-20T02:28:31	I've removed the tweet 
WilliamShatner	711378569805475840	2016-03-20T02:27:22	Really? I need permission to comment on a photo? It's fair use as it was not for commercial value. 
WilliamShatner	711376537551917056	2016-03-20T02:19:17	...to be accused of stealing the photo by a charity no less is reprehensible. I never made a claim that the photo was mine.
WilliamShatner	711375959203532800	2016-03-20T02:17:00	...there were no photo credits and I thought the images were interesting enough to comment on them. I posted one of them with a comment...
WilliamShatner	711375463063678976	2016-03-20T02:15:01	Just for the record I found a blog site this morning that had a number of photos from the NYC subways featuring Outlander. ...
WilliamShatner	711374399555829760	2016-03-20T02:10:48	I stole that photo? Maybe as a charity you need to choose your words more carefully? Never mind I'm done with you! 
WilliamShatner	711373542864982016	2016-03-20T02:07:23	Feud? 
WilliamShatner	711373128249663488	2016-03-20T02:05:45	Thank you SVCC and stevewoz!

WilliamShatner	710678113902956544	2016-03-18T04:04:00	That's because I'm sure he's trapped somewhere in Space. They should give him the Lost in Space franchise! He's 👌🏻
