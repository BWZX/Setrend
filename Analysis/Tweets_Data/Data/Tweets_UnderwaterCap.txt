UnderwaterCap	724032166892568577	2016-04-24T00:28:15	This Hempton interview on real vision is pretty awesome.
UnderwaterCap	723903114978451456	2016-04-23T15:55:26	EventDrivenMgr and hey, this biz is actually super capital intensive and relationship + scale driven. Who would have thought?
UnderwaterCap	723902358544113664	2016-04-23T15:52:26	EventDrivenMgr ...mult fee streams that competitors need capex to build, allow margin / ROIC structure contingent on 2nd best competitor.
UnderwaterCap	723901883002310656	2016-04-23T15:50:33	EventDrivenMgr I think that's right. Good point re: digital tickets. End of day LYV will be lowest cost distributor of tickets thx to...
UnderwaterCap	723899739847155714	2016-04-23T15:42:02	EventDrivenMgr key is to entice seller of tics as much as possible. Buyers have 0 bargaining power
UnderwaterCap	723899614403932161	2016-04-23T15:41:32	EventDrivenMgr wondering same. If I were LYV would lower fee to &lt;50% of stubhub &amp; share all $ w/ artist now, just to drive them out of biz
UnderwaterCap	723898705166913536	2016-04-23T15:37:55	EventDrivenMgr for sure. Personally think having a world class secondary platform married to primary then share profits w/ artist way to go
UnderwaterCap	723897674257301504	2016-04-23T15:33:49	EventDrivenMgr recurring &amp; returning biz call for optical fairness. Gd thing LYV building out secondary platform so artist can get a split.

UnderwaterCap	690960580212068352	2016-01-23T18:13:34	This is my favorite thing that I wrote last year: 
UnderwaterCap	717694316538437632	2016-04-06T12:43:53	FourFilters basically they hired a good CEO in 2009, hunkered down and built good products. long cycle both for R&amp;D and share penetration.
UnderwaterCap	717432839067869184	2016-04-05T19:24:52	FourFilters the next 2-3 years should be blowout years for these guys and sellside too low on growth and margins.
UnderwaterCap	717432105274355712	2016-04-05T19:21:57	FourFilters ...core product to work flow, impossible to replicate given plumbing and know-how nature. IoT and increasing TAM optionaliy
UnderwaterCap	717431762939457537	2016-04-05T19:20:36	FourFilters duopoly with 7 year investment cycle coming to fruition and taking share, incremental margin sizable, 2016 harvest year

UnderwaterCap	716375663503097856	2016-04-02T21:24:02	Liberty8988 it's a question of risk making 2 decisions vs. 1. If one ain't real smart like buffet neither is easy, which u make it sound.
UnderwaterCap	716374349410865152	2016-04-02T21:18:49	Liberty8988 for every Berkshire, there are 5 other Kodaks that lost their moat and died a horrible death. Hindsight of holding on is 20/20

UnderwaterCap	715412122000363520	2016-03-31T05:35:16	Fritz_100 ...and that, I think, represents the next frontier for someone like us. The next Buffett is probably already compounding there.
UnderwaterCap	715411863710867456	2016-03-31T05:34:14	Fritz_100 ..from most of what I can see practice rudimentary thinking. Real US players can probably run circles around them.
UnderwaterCap	715411648744435713	2016-03-31T05:33:23	Fritz_100 ...and the quality in EM countries is even worse. People don't read financials, earnings takes days to reflect, and players are..

UnderwaterCap	715411308536061952	2016-03-31T05:32:02	Fritz_100 thanks to 20-25 years of IB-&gt;HF talent infusion. But this efficient phenomenon is much less so even in places like Europe...
UnderwaterCap	715411053446828032	2016-03-31T05:31:01	Fritz_100 I certainly get the feeling that the game is getting too hard here in the US and investors basically migrate to earning ROIC...
UnderwaterCap	715410176627630080	2016-03-31T05:27:32	Fritz_100 but yes - as you say, US has gotten very competitive, can't imagine it being true in Asia / EU / other EM mkt tho.
UnderwaterCap	715409804324417536	2016-03-31T05:26:03	Fritz_100 to be fair, one can still outperform...as long as one (1) out-analyze peers, (2) with rising tide / macro / monetary policy...

UnderwaterCap	700502291657326594	2016-02-19T02:08:55	SSCapital13 BluegrassCap Certainly, but many industries start w/ many-to-many and need middle man. Good ROIC at beginning...
UnderwaterCap	700501526867914752	2016-02-19T02:05:53	Valuedontlie The large SKU, small price / part, and large customer spread definitely helps. But I don't see why AMZN can't do what they do

UnderwaterCap	700499419582435328	2016-02-19T01:57:30	UnderwaterCap as well as ability to gouge customers given the exclusivity.

UnderwaterCap	700498155213713408	2016-02-19T01:52:29	DumbLuckCapital I think probably really comes down to this.
UnderwaterCap	700497425375432705	2016-02-19T01:49:35	BluegrassCap Yes! haven't thought of inverting yet. Let me ponder a little...
UnderwaterCap	700497269221535745	2016-02-19T01:48:58	SSCapital13 Yes, probably have to do them to keep customers.
UnderwaterCap	700496819977990144	2016-02-19T01:47:11	UnderwaterCap I think once you have these four STRUCTURAL characteristics, it makes a fantastic ground for a distributor to crush it, no?
UnderwaterCap	700496637441867776	2016-02-19T01:46:27	UnderwaterCap and/or could it be structural difficulty in both supply &amp; demand front to consolidate?
UnderwaterCap	700496550250676224	2016-02-19T01:46:06	UnderwaterCap could it be network benefits as more supplier &amp; buyer get added to the mix, and beyond price pass-thru cost benefits?
UnderwaterCap	700496448903753728	2016-02-19T01:45:42	UnderwaterCap could it be natural economics of scale -- reduction in marginal cost / user as user base grows?
UnderwaterCap	700496328732725248	2016-02-19T01:45:14	UnderwaterCap could it be perishable / Ephymeral supply + time-sensitive, impromptu, and critical demand?
UnderwaterCap	700496227893276672	2016-02-19T01:44:49	UnderwaterCap I think a lot of the points are just end-results...here are my incomplete thought on what could make a solid distributor:
UnderwaterCap	700495475951034368	2016-02-19T01:41:50	@kf_wallywest and gained massive scale against their suppliers.
UnderwaterCap	700495422100480000	2016-02-19T01:41:37	@kf_wallywest Yes, in a sense GDSs like SABR is a distributor too, and that's an excellent business because they own the travel agents...
UnderwaterCap	700494574368600069	2016-02-19T01:38:15	UnderwaterCap ultimately, what gives a distributor a moat?
UnderwaterCap	700493569111433216	2016-02-19T01:34:16	gerardobenitez can say the same about many distributors, whether it's FAST, KLXI, Brenntag, etc. What's so special about them?
UnderwaterCap	700492769005973504	2016-02-19T01:31:05	SSCapital13 but is that really it? In a sense you are just levered to industry volume and earn an ROIC w/ your logistics base...no?
UnderwaterCap	700492607965700096	2016-02-19T01:30:26	SSCapital13 k, so you get volume discount, demand elasticity, marginal cost minimization via logistics, strong working capital position...

UnderwaterCap	699761466862387202	2016-02-17T01:05:09	ShortSightedCap agreed. Was just thinking of a way of tying mgmt's comments re: "we look for 15%+ IRR deals" and my future projs.
UnderwaterCap	699754798384553985	2016-02-17T00:38:39	BrattleStCap Valuetrap13 yes &amp; for another thing, some best businesses' ROIC / ROIIC are at times infinite. raw organic secular so strong
UnderwaterCap	699754148363894785	2016-02-17T00:36:04	Valuetrap13 DocileDean Ah interesting - u mean u make your growth / capital assumptions, then observe ROIIC - &amp; decide if makes sense?
UnderwaterCap	699753759157698561	2016-02-17T00:34:31	Valuetrap13 DocileDean meaning - do you isolate deployed capital growth as a separate NOPAT item and play w/ it accordingly?
UnderwaterCap	699753453418106880	2016-02-17T00:33:18	Valuetrap13 DocileDean thanks - and that's re: how good mgmt was historically. How do you think about forward calcs in your DCF?
UnderwaterCap	699753273725751297	2016-02-17T00:32:35	UnderwaterCap sometimes mgmt tell you (like ind. gas re: 15% IRR on on-site projects) but that's rare - visible proj. &amp; stable industry
UnderwaterCap	699751818562289664	2016-02-17T00:26:48	UnderwaterCap in other words, what's your approach in tying out-year income / CF statement w/ your capital deployment schemes?
UnderwaterCap	699751531168604161	2016-02-17T00:25:40	UnderwaterCap namely, some CapEx don't ramp until out-years, some CapEx / acq are cyclical, and some are hard to pin-point magnitude...
UnderwaterCap	699751123373158400	2016-02-17T00:24:03	Fintwit - how do you think about ROIIC? One can sorta infer from historical inc. EBIT / inc. IC, but how to show on future #'s?
UnderwaterCap	699673867607003136	2016-02-16T19:17:04	SkeleCap buckdeerstocks4 PainCapital SSCapital13 still like it here.
UnderwaterCap	699412650099392520	2016-02-16T01:59:04	SSCapital13 Yep certainly no beat &amp; raise. It's a meh print for me.
UnderwaterCap	699412302622298113	2016-02-16T01:57:42	MarAzul_90 SSCapital13 Referring to LILA.
UnderwaterCap	699411427006771204	2016-02-16T01:54:13	SSCapital13 Seems straight down the fairway. Wonder if FY16 FCF "limited" is due to Capex given their 5-7% rebased OCF guide.
UnderwaterCap	698946799927762944	2016-02-14T19:07:57	UnderwaterCap 2 happening together creates this odd &amp; twisted impression that low oil hurts US -- can't be farther from truth.
UnderwaterCap	698946541344710656	2016-02-14T19:06:55	UnderwaterCap ...one is definitively positive to us funded by cheap credit. The other represents commod-chain demand slowdown &amp; v. negativ
UnderwaterCap	698946258879307776	2016-02-14T19:05:48	Think many comments are lumping the impact of oil &amp; China together. They are interlinked but one must separate them to glean insights.
UnderwaterCap	698591220554211329	2016-02-13T19:35:00	BluegrassCap yeah I stopped around page 30-40 last time. Couldn't beat his writing

UnderwaterCap	698550275087450112	2016-02-13T16:52:18	30minly yep done. A bit too basic.
UnderwaterCap	698240292969955328	2016-02-12T20:20:33	Apparently LILA didn't get the memo yet again

UnderwaterCap	697848637733367808	2016-02-11T18:24:15	SSCapital13 concerned but fact that peers like SIK / HEG trade at 3-5 turn premium is lol
UnderwaterCap	697848389195722753	2016-02-11T18:23:16	SSCapital13 Merica is great. Problem is more EU / Latam / Asia where it makes &gt; 50% there

UnderwaterCap	697541817760354305	2016-02-10T22:05:03	@HuckFund does look strange. Might also have a FX mismatch. Could have some RMB decal risk here. Also seems collecting AR had been issue

UnderwaterCap	697539632171454464	2016-02-10T21:56:22	@HuckFund to be fair, it did look mighty good back then. Didn't know it's 45% share of onsite in China and 15% overall share
UnderwaterCap	697537970673418240	2016-02-10T21:49:46	@HuckFund sure, check inbox
UnderwaterCap	697537726221000704	2016-02-10T21:48:48	@HuckFund think last LTM is something like 5-6. YTW trades in the 15-20 though. Term loan at around 450 bps
UnderwaterCap	697536665607340036	2016-02-10T21:44:35	@HuckFund DB has an initiation back from Jan 2013 that gives decent detail.

UnderwaterCap	697535251040571392	2016-02-10T21:38:58	@HuckFund would be very interesting huh. They also sell 25% more oxygen than nitrogen. China has a long way to go...

UnderwaterCap	697503517557329921	2016-02-10T19:32:52	Where will TSLA trade by March 1st 2016?
UnderwaterCap	697186850520330241	2016-02-09T22:34:32	tmiskiew1 should probably refresh my math. You got a view on used car pricing? I doubt it's going up.
UnderwaterCap	697185843203698689	2016-02-09T22:30:32	tmiskiew1 I guess we'd find out to some extent when CAR prints on feb 23

UnderwaterCap	697167275355435010	2016-02-09T21:16:45	So when does HTZ report earnings?
UnderwaterCap	696033096630673409	2016-02-06T18:09:56	CJJ1267 BrattleStCap yeah good point. I'm curious to see magic. Usually these things hurt experience like overpriced popcorn in theaters.
UnderwaterCap	696031441830989824	2016-02-06T18:03:22	CJJ1267 BrattleStCap it's like saying TWTR can be hugely profitable if they can make a buck from each user. I'm just here for fintwit bro
UnderwaterCap	696031173307461632	2016-02-06T18:02:18	CJJ1267 BrattleStCap definitely. Just thought selling more shirts / beer is tough and artist dependent. Also margin is sht there.
UnderwaterCap	696030842448171008	2016-02-06T18:00:59	CJJ1267 BrattleStCap yeah they don't disclose nothin. Guess anti trust probe = inconvenient. Also dislike how gd artists have all leverage
UnderwaterCap	696029514632187905	2016-02-06T17:55:42	CJJ1267 BrattleStCap can care less about on ground actual concerts. Loss leaders and all economics go to artist. They always take cuts
UnderwaterCap	696029104144019456	2016-02-06T17:54:04	CJJ1267 BrattleStCap yep that's the bull case and v. Logical. They don't talk re: inc margin tho. Any idea on how much they pass thru?
UnderwaterCap	696028684239695873	2016-02-06T17:52:24	CJJ1267 BrattleStCap why isn't it 40%+? my conjecture is they pass thru too much to ecosystem to keep venue / artist / promoters.
UnderwaterCap	696028413421871104	2016-02-06T17:51:19	CJJ1267 BrattleStCap I'm referring to core ticketing. Margin flat for 6 years whereby it should have exploded up given volume and price

UnderwaterCap	688534722977337344	2016-01-17T01:34:04	Leftope @KeshikCapital NoonSixCap Find_Me_Value schaudenfraud no debate there. Just seems v. Irrational to me. AMZN wins aside from Px
UnderwaterCap	688533730030387200	2016-01-17T01:30:08	Leftope @KeshikCapital NoonSixCap Find_Me_Value schaudenfraud esp when the IRR is so visible.
UnderwaterCap	688533622660427776	2016-01-17T01:29:42	Leftope @KeshikCapital NoonSixCap Find_Me_Value schaudenfraud if gating factor is that or mkting, plain arrogance for them to not care
UnderwaterCap	688533410646720513	2016-01-17T01:28:52	Leftope @KeshikCapital NoonSixCap Find_Me_Value schaudenfraud I dunno. Spending 10 mm on better interface seems like no brainer to me
UnderwaterCap	688529956947779584	2016-01-17T01:15:08	NoonSixCap Find_Me_Value schaudenfraud I don't think they get it. Next CEO still a east Europe engineer. Vision is limited imo
UnderwaterCap	688529755335962624	2016-01-17T01:14:20	NoonSixCap Find_Me_Value schaudenfraud no brokers and IB will stand a chance. Literally will become a flywheel monopoly.

UnderwaterCap	688528400747761665	2016-01-17T01:08:57	NoonSixCap Find_Me_Value schaudenfraud but think it could be so much better. Just imagine how bezos would run this biz
UnderwaterCap	688528278907400193	2016-01-17T01:08:28	NoonSixCap Find_Me_Value schaudenfraud personally I think arrogance re: approach to biz is v. Visible. Not discrediting success...
UnderwaterCap	688520000148271109	2016-01-17T00:35:34	Find_Me_Value schaudenfraud NoonSixCap if they actually care about UI, marketing, and customer service  its a 30 Bn co in no time
UnderwaterCap	688519742001426433	2016-01-17T00:34:33	Find_Me_Value schaudenfraud NoonSixCap my opinion is still that mgmt too smug to give a f. Not the best way to max. Potential of biz
UnderwaterCap	688508425249099776	2016-01-16T23:49:35	@kf_wallywest like the intuitive S/D curve framework, I'm wondering if there is anything like that re: inventory
UnderwaterCap	688508084013142016	2016-01-16T23:48:13	BluegrassCap best 20% loss I ever took.
UnderwaterCap	688429432369975297	2016-01-16T18:35:41	UnderwaterCap I have not seen an elegant framework on any textbooks -- one that can be drawn on a napkin. All ears from me if you know.
UnderwaterCap	688429154983931905	2016-01-16T18:34:35	Question: anyone seen good economics textbook / article that goes over inventory dynamics amidst Supply / Demand shifts?

UnderwaterCap	686214197613572096	2016-01-10T15:53:08	UnderwaterCap fair disclosure: totally buying stock once sellside gives up.
UnderwaterCap	686214071633457152	2016-01-10T15:52:38	On neat thing about CMG is that it's reflexive... Stock down = more coverage = awareness = less traffic = SSS down = stock down
UnderwaterCap	686204054716964864	2016-01-10T15:12:50	UnderwaterCap ...and they will. It's everyone for themselves. I can see the perfect storm brewing and this can actually be a donut.
UnderwaterCap	686203852836724736	2016-01-10T15:12:02	UnderwaterCap I get the cost cut &amp; rationalization argument. But what if CAR and Enterprise fight tooth &amp; nail to keep utilization?
UnderwaterCap	686203450019983360	2016-01-10T15:10:26	UnderwaterCap and personally I wonder why Mannheim is holding in. Once it turns HTZ number is gonna crash. 
UnderwaterCap	686202193964331008	2016-01-10T15:05:26	UnderwaterCap See that turn...? Only 1 thing causes it: Falling Demand &amp; Increasing Supply.No wonder OEMs trade like crap.

UnderwaterCap	684747662743220224	2016-01-06T14:45:39	Might short some FCAU
UnderwaterCap	684493638785720321	2016-01-05T21:56:15	Alphal_pha no insight here, interesting point to think about.
UnderwaterCap	684483016471801856	2016-01-05T21:14:02	UnderwaterCap ...finally, think this is closer to reality.

UnderwaterCap	682586082861563904	2015-12-31T15:36:18	Valuetrap13 ...or outright short
UnderwaterCap	682585706695397376	2015-12-31T15:34:48	Valuetrap13 a somewhat serious question, when will you short Berkshire as a hedge instead of the S&amp;P?
UnderwaterCap	682040704152039425	2015-12-30T03:29:10	retardedbearcap agreed. NOAH's mgmt had acted pretty friendly in the past, making this move kind of odd. Wonder if it's Barbarians @ gate
UnderwaterCap	682026746854649856	2015-12-30T02:33:42	yitechang agreed. Same here.
UnderwaterCap	682020545681031168	2015-12-30T02:09:04	yitechang Yep saw that. You buy that claim? Having 50%+ voting right basically means they can do whatever they want.
UnderwaterCap	681581067611049985	2015-12-28T21:02:44	JSiegel88 maybe, but if I reckon correctly they are going to keep it that way. Probably comes down to trusting mgmt allocating capital.
UnderwaterCap	681479269478969344	2015-12-28T14:18:13	NOAH mgmt is hosting special vote to get 2 founders &gt;54% voting right, set on Jan 28th, 2016. Why now? Did they get a privitization offer?

UnderwaterCap	679674313847476224	2015-12-23T14:45:58	Valuetrap13 like this CMG illustrative example I spent 5 minutes putting together...
