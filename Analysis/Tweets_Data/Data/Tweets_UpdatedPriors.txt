UpdatedPriors	693277091987521536	2016-01-30T03:38:33	notsalome Farm subsidies are widespread, 38% of farms collect. Not just the big ones. I get the point: you don't personally receive them.
UpdatedPriors	693276983107584000	2016-01-30T03:38:07	notsalome Your assumptions about my background are wrong. I grew up rural. I moved to DC 5 years ago, and I'm not a politician.
UpdatedPriors	693275368862588928	2016-01-30T03:31:43	notsalome I didn't mean to offend you, and I never said "all". Please read more carefully. I've noted your personal anecdote.

UpdatedPriors	693270034861285377	2016-01-30T03:10:31	notsalome Your Monsanto anecdote is great. But it doesn't prove that rural communities don't benefit from subsidies. Point to research.
UpdatedPriors	693269858826366976	2016-01-30T03:09:49	notsalome I've also seen the data on subsidy dollars rolling into those towns.

UpdatedPriors	693257220595666944	2016-01-30T02:19:36	But the point is, we can't just say this reallocation problem is about lack of "ability to move". People don't want to move!
UpdatedPriors	693256991519543296	2016-01-30T02:18:41	Part of it is that having extended family support is particularly important for people without a lot of education. Childcare, etc.

UpdatedPriors	684442389612658688	2016-01-05T18:32:36	What could explain declining responsiveness? Policy? Changing margins of adjustment? Changes in competitive environment? etc.? Dunno.
UpdatedPriors	684442169633943553	2016-01-05T18:31:44	We infer that the place to look for explaining dynamism is: why have businesses become less responsive to their own productivity? assa2016

UpdatedPriors	684441640669331457	2016-01-05T18:29:38	We infer: Decline in dynamism is about declining responsiveness of businesses to productivity. assa2016
UpdatedPriors	684441323135315969	2016-01-05T18:28:22	The pattern of responsiveness in high tech goes up from 80s to 90s, down after 2000, mimicking dynamism pattern!
UpdatedPriors	684441129912123392	2016-01-05T18:27:36	So now: roughly, regress plant growth on plant TFP with controls. We find that (a) plants are responsive to TFP, (b) less so over time.
UpdatedPriors	684440860637790208	2016-01-05T18:26:32	These facts suggest that changes in the "shock process" can't account for time series dynamism patterns. So, we check responsiveness.
UpdatedPriors	684440665036468224	2016-01-05T18:25:45	Fact 2: the persistence of plant-level TFP has not fallen, has bounced around a bit but roughly stable. (also: it's &lt;0.7). assa2016
UpdatedPriors	684440455233196033	2016-01-05T18:24:55	Fact: the dispersion of plant-level TFP has not fallen, has actually risen, from 1980-2010 (high tech mfg) assa2016
UpdatedPriors	684440205797900288	2016-01-05T18:23:56	Note this is a very reduced form approach. But it's using reduced form coupled with intuition from canonical model.
UpdatedPriors	684439791979462656	2016-01-05T18:22:17	Today we focus on high tech manufacturing. Will expand later. We ask: has measured TFP dispersion fallen? Or responses to TFP? assa2016
UpdatedPriors	684439243553280000	2016-01-05T18:20:06	Our approach: Think Hopenhayn model. Falling reallocation is result of declining shock volatility, or declining responsiveness to shocks.
UpdatedPriors	684439122237239299	2016-01-05T18:19:37	... but flows and entrep rose in info/tech in 1980s/1990s, fell after 2000. So explanation needs to deal with these facts.
UpdatedPriors	684438915994877953	2016-01-05T18:18:48	Important to keep in mind that dynamism patterns are different across sectors. Retail, mfg, services: steady decline since 1980...
UpdatedPriors	684438638227136512	2016-01-05T18:17:42	Fact is declining dynamism (entrep, job/worker flows). Evidence suggests agg productivity growth depends in large part of reallocation pace

UpdatedPriors	684163856373948416	2016-01-05T00:05:49	So Starr worries about measurement error if regdata is proxy for hiring/firing/startup costs.
UpdatedPriors	684163544548388864	2016-01-05T00:04:34	Starr notes that regdata may miss these because it misses state/local regs, misses compliance/enforcement/punishment, etc.
UpdatedPriors	684162595138371584	2016-01-05T00:00:48	Key questions: 1. How large are regulation-specific startup costs? 2. How large are reg-specific job creation/destruction costs?
UpdatedPriors	684162278720028673	2016-01-04T23:59:33	Ok now Evan Starr is discussing the Goldschlag &amp; Tabarrok paper. Main question is about how well fed reg counts are measuring "regulation"

UpdatedPriors	684159557514309633	2016-01-04T23:48:44	.Noahpinion Note: measure of regs is purely a count. Not measuring how stringent, etc, they are. But certainly should move priors.

UpdatedPriors	684158088249622528	2016-01-04T23:42:53	Now ATabarrok is presenting this paper, finding that industries with increased federal regs have not seen larger dynamism declines.
UpdatedPriors	684157325695827968	2016-01-04T23:39:52	ejenk ATabarrok well it's an externality argument

UpdatedPriors	684156265015029760	2016-01-04T23:35:39	"Be skeptical of expansions in intellect property rent seeking"
UpdatedPriors	684156168193748992	2016-01-04T23:35:16	.ATabarrok : NCs are a type of intellectual property: "intellect property". Knowledge is in heads, NCs prevent talking and walking.
UpdatedPriors	684155938803027968	2016-01-04T23:34:21	Alex wants the issue to be set in broader context of the political economy of IP law.
UpdatedPriors	684155650595684352	2016-01-04T23:33:12	Alex guesses it's a prisoner's dilemma issue. Each firm locking workers in, reducing worker flows in general. It's an externality.
UpdatedPriors	684155467388420097	2016-01-04T23:32:29	Says ATabarrok , standard theory of NCs does not apply to low-wage workers. Hence, firms likely using (empty) NC threat to reduce turnover.
UpdatedPriors	684155026466459648	2016-01-04T23:30:43	UpdatedPriors ATabarrok maybe employers should provide separate bonus for NC instead of lumping into salary.
UpdatedPriors	684154746735742976	2016-01-04T23:29:37	.ATabarrok highlights that even low-wage workers are turning down jobs b/c of NCs! 51% of them report this. So, woah.
UpdatedPriors	684154487599058945	2016-01-04T23:28:35	Likely that higher offer/search activity among NC workers reflects underlying worker types, as ATabarrok notes in discussion
UpdatedPriors	684154261437943808	2016-01-04T23:27:41	Note also that job offers and search are higher among workers with NCs.
UpdatedPriors	684153567905628160	2016-01-04T23:24:56	Workers do report getting benefits from NCs. Employers treat them better when outside offers are coming in.
UpdatedPriors	684153366369320960	2016-01-04T23:24:08	jarmin_ron But not all workers report that they worry about NCs when considering job offers.
UpdatedPriors	684153116602707968	2016-01-04T23:23:08	jarmin_ron Only in survey data... Lots of workers report that they fear enforcement, lawsuits, etc.
UpdatedPriors	684152977154674688	2016-01-04T23:22:35	In data, NCs make people turn down offers from competitors. Why? Workers for whom NCs affect decisions fear getting sued, fear enforcement.
UpdatedPriors	684152571066322944	2016-01-04T23:20:58	In data, NCs boost tenure. Induce job search among noncompetitors. Don't reduce job offers. Offers from competitors increase current wages.
UpdatedPriors	684150459813109760	2016-01-04T23:12:35	Finds NCs somewhat increase reservation wages (though I would say by not a lot, based on the chart). Smaller set of feasible job offers.
