tanehisicoates	725037113406836736	2016-04-26T19:01:33	Inevitably. Mostly in learning to conjure emotion without huge blocks of text.  
tanehisicoates	725036776360939523	2016-04-26T19:00:12	Given my aesthetics, was cool to play a game where you are not going to save the world. You're just trying to survive as long as possible.

tanehisicoates	725036303688040448	2016-04-26T18:58:19	Anyway, writing comics right now, a lot to learn from BannerSaga on how emotion is conjured and evoked. More on this soon.
tanehisicoates	725036131256025088	2016-04-26T18:57:38	The funeral scene at the end of BannerSaga just wrecked me. Story is strong in this one. More narrative  narrative than RPG.

tanehisicoates	724226037433946112	2016-04-24T13:18:37	Lollardfish lol. How the hell did they trace that genealogy?
tanehisicoates	724225826317852672	2016-04-24T13:17:47	tanehisicoates BertoltMEHcht jbouie Them being racist isn't an argument against their protection.
tanehisicoates	724225717861527552	2016-04-24T13:17:21	tanehisicoates BertoltMEHcht jbouie I support them regardless, because it's right, on its face. I'd like them to be anti-racist, but...
tanehisicoates	724225589952040961	2016-04-24T13:16:50	tanehisicoates BertoltMEHcht jbouie ... in order to support their efforts to unionize.
tanehisicoates	724225559832698880	2016-04-24T13:16:43	tanehisicoates BertoltMEHcht jbouie To put this differently, I don't need miners in West Virginia to be anti-racist...
tanehisicoates	724225341296914436	2016-04-24T13:15:51	BertoltMEHcht jbouie Women were sterilized by the state. Should they be paid back for that, or not? 
tanehisicoates	724225127987159040	2016-04-24T13:15:00	BertoltMEHcht jbouie I think that's hard when you start talking about specifics. Take reparations in North Carolina.
tanehisicoates	724224806082752513	2016-04-24T13:13:43	Tell us now. 
tanehisicoates	724224289973624832	2016-04-24T13:11:40	Heh. "Thank you very much. I'll be here all week, folks." 
tanehisicoates	724223837848645632	2016-04-24T13:09:53	cmbsweden Yeah. And it would change depending on the focus. It needs to be case by cases. Housing repar will differ from ed, for instance.
tanehisicoates	724223416870555649	2016-04-24T13:08:12	BertoltMEHcht jbouie If I mug you, I don't get to say "I will only pay you back if this radically alters the economic system."
tanehisicoates	724223268195045376	2016-04-24T13:07:37	BertoltMEHcht jbouie I don't actually know. I just don't think the legitimacy of the case should rest on that.
tanehisicoates	724222718586028032	2016-04-24T13:05:26	Basically I like opening my checks. Hate opening my bills. 
tanehisicoates	724222523248902144	2016-04-24T13:04:39	Sure. My focus was on housing and redlining. Depends on for what, though.   
tanehisicoates	724222092233838592	2016-04-24T13:02:56	ivorytowerstyle jbouie Yep. Understood.
tanehisicoates	724220675934707712	2016-04-24T12:57:19	tanehisicoates I have come to the view that there are a lot of people who just don’t view slavery as a moral crime.
tanehisicoates	724220765994934272	2016-04-24T12:57:40	It's not even slavery. Red-lining is within living memory. Like convict-leasing is 20th century... 
tanehisicoates	724220536587489285	2016-04-24T12:56:45	Talked to a guy once who endorsed repar for internment, but not redlining. Didn't want to "dig into the past." lol 
tanehisicoates	724218154096955392	2016-04-24T12:47:17	Uhh, generally, yeah... 
tanehisicoates	724217645952802816	2016-04-24T12:45:16	jwedoff Wolfenhaus No, you didn't. But it would be an ongoing effort. They believe there are thousands.
tanehisicoates	724217040073007104	2016-04-24T12:42:52	jbouie Abandon this harebrained attempt at reparations, and pick more pragmatic battles...like the destruction of capitalism.
tanehisicoates	724216087882113024	2016-04-24T12:39:05	"If system stole capital from oppressed people once, it will do it again. Break up the banks, it will be stolen." 
tanehisicoates	724215875784552449	2016-04-24T12:38:14	jwedoff Wolfenhaus 272. 
tanehisicoates	724214380540366848	2016-04-24T12:32:18	So..."Breaking up the banks only makes sense if you destroy the system that necessitated banks in the first place." 
tanehisicoates	724213726786818048	2016-04-24T12:29:42	From Georgetown, I imagine so. Not really hard though. We know, specifically, who was enslaved and sold.  
tanehisicoates	724212729133830145	2016-04-24T12:25:44	Saw Bernie couldn't embrace. But the beat goes on.
tanehisicoates	724212554931789826	2016-04-24T12:25:02	President of Yale called for reparations in 1810--"To give them liberty, and stop here, is to entail upon them a curse." Was right.
tanehisicoates	724212208142524416	2016-04-24T12:23:40	As SandyDarity has said, worth beginning reparations conversations at the level of Universities which would not exist but for plunder.
tanehisicoates	724211924355960834	2016-04-24T12:22:32	"...which should clearly include a scholarship fund for the descendants of those who were sold to save the institution."
tanehisicoates	724211880223465472	2016-04-24T12:22:22	"Georgetown is morally obligated to adopt restorative measures..."
tanehisicoates	724211685557436418	2016-04-24T12:21:35	"When the school fell into trouble, the sale of the African-American men, women and children staved off its ruin."
tanehisicoates	724211623804723200	2016-04-24T12:21:20	"At Georgetown, slavery and scholarship were inextricably linked. "

tanehisicoates	724211416778051584	2016-04-24T12:20:31	First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then... 
tanehisicoates	724171401041686528	2016-04-24T09:41:31	So beautiful. And so James Brown. 
tanehisicoates	723921630502739969	2016-04-23T17:09:01	jsmooth995 So like cool in the abstract. But in the actual...
tanehisicoates	723920174563373060	2016-04-23T17:03:14	jsmooth995 That's sort of surprising though. I thought that that was the goal.
tanehisicoates	723919623452663809	2016-04-23T17:01:02	tanehisicoates My impression is part of it was his discomfort with seeing audience at shows so much whiter after purple rain hit
tanehisicoates	723919054788919297	2016-04-23T16:58:47	tanehisicoates hip-hop def affected him later on but this shift started before that.

tanehisicoates	723909747842387968	2016-04-23T16:21:48	On second thought I would merely be injured for you...

tanehisicoates	723907992983359488	2016-04-23T16:14:49	FisherBurton It was a joke.
tanehisicoates	723907518473342976	2016-04-23T16:12:56	On further reflection doves do NOT cry... 
tanehisicoates	723906942482128897	2016-04-23T16:10:39	Indeed. It seems clarifying to note that  "thoughts of you" could not possibly "get in my eyes."  
tanehisicoates	723905464392683520	2016-04-23T16:04:46	That is such great phrasing..."a lie about a lie."

tanehisicoates	723859378542133250	2016-04-23T13:01:39	Spacejunc tanehisicoates jbouie "Italian"? They didn't even get his age right. Prince was born in 1958; he wasn't 22 in 1983.
tanehisicoates	723859964796739584	2016-04-23T13:03:58	naunihalpublic Done.
tanehisicoates	723858969823948800	2016-04-23T13:00:01	tanehisicoates but I could very well be wrong, and this could have been his promo ppl. My memories are v fuzzy.
tanehisicoates	723859795267203072	2016-04-23T13:03:18	Ehh, both his parents were black. Prince didn't have "one drop." Dude had a swimming pool. 
tanehisicoates	723858861266853888	2016-04-23T12:59:35	tanehisicoates Remember Prince was part of the "racially ambiguous" 80's generation: DeBarge, Vanity, Jennifer Beals, Shabadu, Lisa Lisa.
tanehisicoates	723859389694775296	2016-04-23T13:01:41	And not just standard-bearers, like, selling records. Being black and not experiencing as some sort of cap on their record sales.
tanehisicoates	723859204994400256	2016-04-23T13:00:57	Really think that's hip-hop....Evolution in black music to where Tupac and Big are standard bearers. 
tanehisicoates	723858921685954561	2016-04-23T12:59:50	jack_hamilton jbouie He probably had seen how that siloed him, no?
tanehisicoates	723858283275145216	2016-04-23T12:57:18	jbouie tanehisicoates one of his key demands w/ his first deal with warners was that he'd be handled by their pop department, not r&amp;b
tanehisicoates	723858697559150592	2016-04-23T12:58:56	Haha. Love when black folks do this. All hustle. bomani_jones anildash  
tanehisicoates	723857938251538432	2016-04-23T12:55:55	jbouie tanehisicoates  here's a rolling stone article with a claim of Italian heritage
tanehisicoates	723857936695603200	2016-04-23T12:55:55	jbouie tanehisicoates he was very aware that mainstream rock media wouldn't cover him if they associated him w/ r&amp;b i.e. "black" music
tanehisicoates	723857731900329984	2016-04-23T12:55:06	tanehisicoates iirc, Prince made that claim himself in different forums. There's a 1983 Rolling Stones interview where I saw this claim.
tanehisicoates	723857564795056128	2016-04-23T12:54:26	bomani_jones tanehisicoates I should be careful — it was a lie spread by promo materials he likely saw. Dunno whose idea it was.
tanehisicoates	723857543513182209	2016-04-23T12:54:21	jbouie tanehisicoates he was very cagey about race in early interviews. sometimes claimed his mom was italian, sometimes his dad.
tanehisicoates	723857523460169728	2016-04-23T12:54:16	tanehisicoates In Dylan's autobiography, he admitted he would just lie to interviewers. Thus people thought he was Jewish and an army brat

tanehisicoates	723856788425183232	2016-04-23T12:51:21	I've heard it before, but not really from black folks. 
tanehisicoates	723856476213792769	2016-04-23T12:50:07	Though this piece came out before Purple Rain so it was in the air before then.
tanehisicoates	723856324547743744	2016-04-23T12:49:31	Interested in how Prince came to be seen as biracial. (Or more so than any other black person.) Betting Purple Rain had a lot to do with it.
tanehisicoates	723855848980779008	2016-04-23T12:47:37	This piece by Robert Palmer on Prince is great, but IDs him as of "mixed black-Italian parentage."

tanehisicoates	721009142488367104	2016-04-15T16:15:49	tanehisicoates Hell, it's hard to keep continuity straight in stand-alone novels with no previous story.
tanehisicoates	721009040105553921	2016-04-15T16:15:25	First issue was very hard. By Issue #5 I felt more in control. Wasn't "easy" though. 
tanehisicoates	721008404618153984	2016-04-15T16:12:54	A hard time to come in. I actually think that was bad. I liked up to Inferno...Things went a little crazy after. 
tanehisicoates	721007270285414402	2016-04-15T16:08:23	Of course that played a role in me quitting comics for a while, so there's that...
tanehisicoates	721007172084240388	2016-04-15T16:08:00	Hah. Remembering when the X-Men basically disappeared for like 20 issues of Claremont's run. Post-Inferno. 
tanehisicoates	721006889681690624	2016-04-15T16:06:52	gregsasso tropicalsteve BenjySarlin mattduss Even as the writer is telling their individual story. Have to adjust.
tanehisicoates	721006822283460608	2016-04-15T16:06:36	gregsasso tropicalsteve BenjySarlin mattduss It's really, really hard. Also consider that overarching story-lines change.
tanehisicoates	721006146178392065	2016-04-15T16:03:55	No. Not laziness at all. Really really hard. 
tanehisicoates	721004670009896961	2016-04-15T15:58:03	tanehisicoates mattduss FWIW, I read Marvel Unlimited constantly and still don't get like 30% of the backstory of any series at any moment
tanehisicoates	721004585285001216	2016-04-15T15:57:43	Yeah. It's who I am. But in a few years, at some point there will another BP writer who will feel diff. 
tanehisicoates	721004325984714752	2016-04-15T15:56:41	It's the TPB. You want...   
tanehisicoates	721002474543439872	2016-04-15T15:49:20	tanehisicoates Same with video games. We just bashed our heads into Mega Man 3 until we blacked out.
tanehisicoates	721004040256139266	2016-04-15T15:55:33	mattduss Or just the gnawing of not knowing and the pleasure of finding out, when you do.
tanehisicoates	721003889424736257	2016-04-15T15:54:57	Also...After writing I'll never grouse about continuity again. It is extremely hard to make everything cohere.
tanehisicoates	721003618292224001	2016-04-15T15:53:52	TOTALLY AWESOME HULK #5 preview! Gorgeous MikeHChoi art! Amadeus origin! Enchantress! And who's behind the wheel? 
tanehisicoates	721003601024458752	2016-04-15T15:53:48	Genre. And I actually find it charming. Like "not knowing" is a part of life. I don't want to be estranged from it. 
tanehisicoates	721003378327830529	2016-04-15T15:52:55	I mean if I didn't have Unlimited, it woulda been hard. Still ended ordering old stuff off ebay for research. 
tanehisicoates	721003036533874689	2016-04-15T15:51:34	tanehisicoates It's why having an older brother was so key. He was like my Google, explaining the backstory.
tanehisicoates	721002806023491587	2016-04-15T15:50:39	I mean, I know it happened but...
tanehisicoates	721002760821452800	2016-04-15T15:50:28	I still haven't found the Black Panther issues where Ramonda is held prisoner in South Africa. And I'm writing the book...
tanehisicoates	721002624221323264	2016-04-15T15:49:55	Right. And even if you can. Knowing what happened isn't like seeing what happened. 
tanehisicoates	721002517103001600	2016-04-15T15:49:30	No I support Wikipedia for comics. Not saying people shouldn't research. 
tanehisicoates	721002431522467841	2016-04-15T15:49:09	But it didn't so, like, if fools said "The Human Beatbox is dead" you just had to believe them....No way to know if it's true or not.
tanehisicoates	721002274844196864	2016-04-15T15:48:32	Less this turn into "off my lawn"-ism, if Google existed back then I woulda been the first one on it.
tanehisicoates	721002145236066304	2016-04-15T15:48:01	Like you just had to be lost. No way out of it.
tanehisicoates	721002081285447683	2016-04-15T15:47:46	When I started with X-Men, Storm had lost her powers. No real way to no how and why, except digging through back issues.
tanehisicoates	721001929380360194	2016-04-15T15:47:10	She was dead. So unless you had access to back issues, you wasn't really gonna find out.
tanehisicoates	721001835197296640	2016-04-15T15:46:47	Yo for like a year after I started reading Amazing Spiderman I didn't know what Gwen Stacy LOOKED LIKE. lol.
tanehisicoates	721001723037413376	2016-04-15T15:46:20	And it was the same thing with comics.
tanehisicoates	721001674098241537	2016-04-15T15:46:09	To say nothing of "illmatic" or "Only Built 4 Cuban Links." What the hell was up with those samples? You just couldn't know.
tanehisicoates	721001518904778752	2016-04-15T15:45:32	I mean WTF does "Welcome To The Terrordome" mean?
tanehisicoates	721001445743529984	2016-04-15T15:45:14	In the 80s and early 90s, being lost was necessary. When BDP shouted "The Bridge Is Over" I had no real idea what they were talking about.
tanehisicoates	721001292290768896	2016-04-15T15:44:38	One of the things I'm seeing with this foray into narrative fiction is the difference in aesthetics re: being lost.
tanehisicoates	721000963184726016	2016-04-15T15:43:19	k_speakseasily Ahh, I know!! 
tanehisicoates	721000856670375938	2016-04-15T15:42:54	k_speakseasily Highly recommend this. 
tanehisicoates	721000749912715264	2016-04-15T15:42:28	k_speakseasily I don't know, because most folks focus on the entirety of the thing.
tanehisicoates	721000385339482112	2016-04-15T15:41:02	Always tough for me because I just jumped in. Again, I think it's important to be OK with being lost. 
tanehisicoates	720990138067775488	2016-04-15T15:00:18	20 pages per issues, with a couple exceptions...

tanehisicoates	720722539262124032	2016-04-14T21:16:58	freddiedeboer StoneColdBalla Agree btw. On both points.
tanehisicoates	720384646337331201	2016-04-13T22:54:18	Changed my avi for the first time in honor of tanehisicoates BLACK PANTHER.   Get it.
tanehisicoates	720387414762528769	2016-04-13T23:05:18	Hear nprAudie's extended interview with tanehisicoates about Black Panther:  
tanehisicoates	720495423421616128	2016-04-14T06:14:29	tanehisicoates just got my BlackPanther, &amp; 3 for friends. I'm new to comics, but why so short? I wanted more! 
tanehisicoates	720530599602208768	2016-04-14T08:34:16	tanehisicoates Oh look! 
tanehisicoates	720719450857738240	2016-04-14T21:04:42	StoneColdBalla freddiedeboer Not exactly.   
tanehisicoates	720361807270043648	2016-04-13T21:23:33	Then you see panels like this from colorista and you understand. The energy crackling off Ayo's iwisa sets it off. 
tanehisicoates	720361361553940480	2016-04-13T21:21:46	I only had a vague sense of what the colorist brought to comic book, until working with one.
tanehisicoates	720361001011560448	2016-04-13T21:20:20	This piece on what colorista is bringing to Black Panther is phenomenal.  
tanehisicoates	720359954985529344	2016-04-13T21:16:11	Today I set up my "pull" for tanehisicoates Black Panther, with Liz at Ann Arbor's VaultOfMidnight. Thanks! 
tanehisicoates	720281634906447872	2016-04-13T16:04:58	We sat down with tanehisicoates to get his take on his must-read Marvel 'Black Panther':  
tanehisicoates	720271169228783620	2016-04-13T15:23:23	MsFolling Evidently others there hadn't either. Did not bother to check before tweeting at me.
tanehisicoates	720270351519891457	2016-04-13T15:20:08	meganfrancis Thank you :)
tanehisicoates	720268094162214912	2016-04-13T15:11:10	meganfrancis It is. But you could just say "My bad. I should have checked."
tanehisicoates	720267918332862464	2016-04-13T15:10:28	If you gonna come after it...then you kinda gotta at least flip through it on some "Who did this cat cite?" ish.
tanehisicoates	720267625801105413	2016-04-13T15:09:18	You ain't gotta read Between The World And Me. I mean, if I were you, I probably wouldn't after all the damn hype around it. But yo...
tanehisicoates	720267465670799360	2016-04-13T15:08:40	That's the only academic cite in the book. It's a black woman. There's also a good section on historian Linda Heywood got me woke.
tanehisicoates	720267161059639296	2016-04-13T15:07:27	You can't accuse people of not using citations...when you don't actually read citations.... 
tanehisicoates	720266976409620480	2016-04-13T15:06:43	...but before you trumpet the specific, case, it's worth checking out the book first.
tanehisicoates	720266821690126337	2016-04-13T15:06:06	...not citing black woman. And that's cool. I get the general point. I get encouraging the work of black women and black women historians...
tanehisicoates	720266654597439488	2016-04-13T15:05:27	Hey so I'm just gonna clear this up, I'm not sure what AERA16 is, but apparently something was said there about Between The World And Me..
tanehisicoates	720265518494691328	2016-04-13T15:00:56	tanehisicoates meganfrancis can't use "erasure" then delete the tweet. Smh...
tanehisicoates	720265552158187520	2016-04-13T15:01:04	hessowellspoken meganfrancis ...and just delete the tweet like it happen.
tanehisicoates	720264148131549186	2016-04-13T14:55:29	Coates only cites one person in the book. It's a black woman...

tanehisicoates	719890677593718784	2016-04-12T14:11:27	Mass incarceration wouldn't have happened w/o crime spike But mass incarceration was by no means the only available response to crime spike
tanehisicoates	719644725968510977	2016-04-11T21:54:07	vileseed jbouie Again.  
tanehisicoates	719644421881491456	2016-04-11T21:52:55	demisaysstuff jbouie You don't cheerlead for the Iraq War and then say, "Eh there would have been war without me" and claim innocence.
tanehisicoates	719644323541815296	2016-04-11T21:52:31	demisaysstuff jbouie I don't think that makes the bill--or the rhetoric around it-- harmless, though.
tanehisicoates	719644092439883779	2016-04-11T21:51:36	demisaysstuff jbouie That certainly was the goal. It seems to have had very little actual effect though. 
tanehisicoates	719643740692967425	2016-04-11T21:50:12	kdrum simonshaykhet tolfoster Sure. But I wasn't commenting on what Dem pols did. I was claiming it was bad policy. And yet, here we are.

tanehisicoates	719605916958650369	2016-04-11T19:19:54	Nah. I can sincerely set my house on fire to get rid of termites. Still worth asking why I set my house on fire.

tanehisicoates	719604002850254848	2016-04-11T19:12:18	MarkARKleiman Yeah I don't believe that. 
tanehisicoates	719602198355845120	2016-04-11T19:05:08	Honestly. And I hate saying this. But you gotta start with Fugitive Slave Law. Historical memory is a thing.

tanehisicoates	719600466154364929	2016-04-11T18:58:15	Mass incarceration is certainly one answer to crime. But it's worth asking why that specific answer was chosen. Ain't the only one.
tanehisicoates	719600083956838400	2016-04-11T18:56:44	Murder rates doubling was not unique to America. A 700 per 100k imprisonment rate was.   
tanehisicoates	719599564932706304	2016-04-11T18:54:40	Anyway. I tried to write a post on this. Realized I was repeating myself. Already said it. 
tanehisicoates	719599177097940993	2016-04-11T18:53:07	One need not even imagine. Current response to heroin is incredible, to anyone who lived through the era of the "Crack baby."
tanehisicoates	719599004649189378	2016-04-11T18:52:26	The notion that "high crime" inevitably leads to "mass incarceration" fails to imagine a diff reality, if a diff group had been effected.
tanehisicoates	719598685672382464	2016-04-11T18:51:10	It's amazing how little the rhetoric has changed. “Negro slayers of Negroes will be thoroughly prosecuted.”  Sound familiar?
tanehisicoates	719598442784419841	2016-04-11T18:50:12	Sheer scope of it is new, but like, they practiced this a century ago. 
tanehisicoates	719598242070208513	2016-04-11T18:49:25	Thing to understand is--relatively--mass incarceration is not new for black people.
tanehisicoates	719598138416369664	2016-04-11T18:49:00	jbouie I'd say racism is the context. Racism the fuel, rather. Crime was the match. But the fuel was everywhere.
tanehisicoates	719596933963214849	2016-04-11T18:44:13	Item: Basic ratio of black to white prisoners in America is the same as it was 100 years ago in Northern cities. 
tanehisicoates	719596651841777664	2016-04-11T18:43:05	As though the discourse on crime began with the 90s, or with Nixon. As though the country wasn't already primed for mass incar.
tanehisicoates	719596410425995264	2016-04-11T18:42:08	But the basic outline of it "High crime=Mass incarceration" assumes that "high crime" is a neutral idea, uninformed by history.
tanehisicoates	719596022507376640	2016-04-11T18:40:35	Amend that. It's been challenged quite a bit. I don't want to overlook folks doing this work.
tanehisicoates	719595631732514816	2016-04-11T18:39:02	The notion that "high crime" caused mass incarceration really, really should be challenged.
tanehisicoates	719594814505938947	2016-04-11T18:35:47	Kyle_Moler voxdotcom I don't think saying 94 bill didn't "cause" mass incarceration is a defense.

tanehisicoates	718794744390934533	2016-04-09T13:36:36	Yes! At my favorite comics shop in Johannesburg &amp; got Black Panther joint by tanehisicoates &amp; Stelfreeze T'challa! 
tanehisicoates	718793520417501184	2016-04-09T13:31:44	jbouie Yeah. I mean, it's not like there wasn't an audience.
tanehisicoates	718792545472552960	2016-04-09T13:27:52	jbouie Yeah. I actually think federal (or presidential) policy is more important in terms of "signaling" if that makes sense.
tanehisicoates	718792316488589312	2016-04-09T13:26:57	Retrospective critique of crime bill reminds me: What will young protesters say about Zika+other public health threats in 2035?
tanehisicoates	718792112213467141	2016-04-09T13:26:08	Hah. So was I and every kid I went to school with. (No shade to my buddy Harold.)  
tanehisicoates	718791717651148800	2016-04-09T13:24:34	jbouie Pachacutec_ leoncrawl bmaz Well feds first, no? The Hatch-Kennedy bill in the 70s which encouraged mandatory minimums.
tanehisicoates	718791504794382337	2016-04-09T13:23:43	haroldpollack jbouie leoncrawl And that is the question...
tanehisicoates	718791407490699264	2016-04-09T13:23:20	jbouie Agree.
tanehisicoates	718791361181458432	2016-04-09T13:23:09	haroldpollack jbouie leoncrawl You can't say "It wasn't my fault" and then take credit too...
tanehisicoates	718791240716824576	2016-04-09T13:22:40	haroldpollack jbouie leoncrawl That's the other thing. Linking 94 bill to crime fall is...dubious. Really, really dubious.
tanehisicoates	718790955218956288	2016-04-09T13:21:32	haroldpollack jbouie leoncrawl Especially for...a leader.
tanehisicoates	718790914169249792	2016-04-09T13:21:23	haroldpollack jbouie leoncrawl Agree. And I think that's important. "Just going along" is diff then "leading" but it isn't exculpatory.
tanehisicoates	718790677748936705	2016-04-09T13:20:26	jbouie And defending the racist superpredator myth--after it's own author disavowed it--is just indefensible.
tanehisicoates	718790526317817856	2016-04-09T13:19:50	jbouie Or Biden claiming that one of his goals was to lock Willie Horton up in jail is different.
tanehisicoates	718790409774854148	2016-04-09T13:19:22	jbouie Clinton flying home to see Ricky Ray Rector executed and then saying, "No one can ever say I'm soft on crime" is different.
tanehisicoates	718790168820498432	2016-04-09T13:18:25	jbouie Also limited options for black pols and their community.
tanehisicoates	718789634172588032	2016-04-09T13:16:17	jbouie Other thing that's ignored is the blatant way Clinton--and Biden for that matter--played on white fear. It's really, really bad.
tanehisicoates	718788923665879040	2016-04-09T13:13:28	@jbouie leoncrawl Certainly helped create helped it along. It's like a lot of people argued for Iraq War. Doesn't mean they "caused" it.
tanehisicoates	718788670174662656	2016-04-09T13:12:28	jbouie leoncrawl Agree that it didn't "cause" mass incarceration. "Cause" it a bridge too far. But the rhetoric, the federal funding etc.

tanehisicoates	717423792721633281	2016-04-05T18:48:55	tanehisicoates Yes! And even if you had the cash for issue 258, you still needed to find a shop that had it, and a ride to get there...
tanehisicoates	717423286729084928	2016-04-05T18:46:55	tanehisicoates ...now looking at one of the JESSICA JONES volumes, Alan Moore's SWAMP-THING, etc. But it started w/ just wanting Superman.
tanehisicoates	717421759700414465	2016-04-05T18:40:51	tanehisicoates I can tell you from experience at SVComicCon that the comic community is the most smiling and passionate there is,
tanehisicoates	717421898343260160	2016-04-05T18:41:24	Sure. But I only had a name-brand character I liked. I wanted Spiderman. But that led to Secret Wars, Powerman etc. 
tanehisicoates	717421503478890497	2016-04-05T18:39:50	I mean for years I ain't know who "Ows" was...Took years to figure out it was the editor.  And that (later) that was Christopher Priest.
tanehisicoates	717420983443918849	2016-04-05T18:37:46	In this sense, learning comics is like learning language. Gotta make piece with not knowing. Just dive in. Don't let fools intimidate.
tanehisicoates	717420817785753600	2016-04-05T18:37:06	You just had to, like, not know. And that was kinda OK. You'd start making up things that happened in #258.
tanehisicoates	717420662038650882	2016-04-05T18:36:29	And you spend months like "Yo what happened in Amazing Spiderman #258???" You couldn't google. You prolly ain't have chips to cop back issue
tanehisicoates	717420483260579840	2016-04-05T18:35:46	Coolest thing about being 10 was seeing a note in Amazing Spiderman like "*see Ish 258 --Ows"
tanehisicoates	717419960759427072	2016-04-05T18:33:42	Like be cool understanding you won't get everything. That's the experience for everyone.
tanehisicoates	717419842698088448	2016-04-05T18:33:14	I think it's really really important for new readers to just sorta surrender when it comes to continuity. 
tanehisicoates	717419643565047808	2016-04-05T18:32:26	tanehisicoates nikjames Also like wine in that there are jerk gatekeepers. Not strawmen.
tanehisicoates	717419648627712000	2016-04-05T18:32:27	Indeed. I think continuity is part of it. But continuity is actually sorta awesome if you roll with it...

tanehisicoates	717112192118558720	2016-04-04T22:10:44	Yes. Completely imaginative. Like being a runner, and have to learn to bike.

tanehisicoates	717110612355059712	2016-04-04T22:04:27	Nah. "If it's a lie, we fight on the lie." lol 
tanehisicoates	717110490405711872	2016-04-04T22:03:58	I still like owning the individual paper. I got a copy of every variant of BP #1 sitting here. Still want that. Maybe just all at once...
tanehisicoates	717110104630251520	2016-04-04T22:02:26	tanehisicoates: Marvel is releasing an entire volume of Squirrel Girl at one time (in the fall), by the same creative as the series.
tanehisicoates	717110142370586624	2016-04-04T22:02:35	tanehisicoates Image did it digitally with a series back in 2014, but beyond that, I can't remember if anyone else has tried it.
tanehisicoates	717110173991624704	2016-04-04T22:02:43	Right. Netflix avoids being a "movie," in the way you'd want to avoid being a "graphic novel. 
tanehisicoates	717109855270645760	2016-04-04T22:01:27	Yeah...But maybe you just sell, like, 12 individual issues? IDK... 
tanehisicoates	717109655223185408	2016-04-04T22:00:39	Rarely, although digital-first serialization is becoming more common. 
tanehisicoates	717109671547559936	2016-04-04T22:00:43	Like I've got S1 of Panther written. (Basically.) Would it work if writers\artists waited and dumped the volume all at once?
tanehisicoates	717109474025213952	2016-04-04T21:59:56	More mean like a company releasing a volume. Instead of month to month. 
tanehisicoates	717109090787463168	2016-04-04T21:58:25	Still, this is interesting. Curious if a comic company could take the Netflix approach. Maybe they already have? 
tanehisicoates	717108932905476096	2016-04-04T21:57:47	Except it's month to month--harder to wait. 
tanehisicoates	717108697978314752	2016-04-04T21:56:51	Yeah this. If you can sequester yourself, wait. If you can't, buy. 
tanehisicoates	717107988662784002	2016-04-04T21:54:02	I think if you like comics then add. If you're just reading this ONE comic, then wait.  
tanehisicoates	717104275017572353	2016-04-04T21:39:16	Just got a page from Stelfreeze. My god. By Script #3, I realized that  basically was to get out this dude's way.

tanehisicoates	716760626803175428	2016-04-03T22:53:44	But I suspect that's a great way to play yourself.
tanehisicoates	716760484716916737	2016-04-03T22:53:10	Being "well-researched" or "doing reporting" is confused with some all-around, universal, always applicable, multidisciplinary intelligence.

tanehisicoates	716759948726808577	2016-04-03T22:51:03	Like, that's always been my process. Study. Study. Study. Then talk. But people think you are what someone gave you.
tanehisicoates	716759754807328768	2016-04-03T22:50:16	Someone stopped me on the street today, desperate for me to do more public speaking here on politics. And I told him, I'm still studying.
tanehisicoates	716759490859761664	2016-04-03T22:49:14	On some fundamental level, when orgs give you things, people stop seeing you. They only see what people give you. That's who you are.

tanehisicoates	716759147279163396	2016-04-03T22:47:52	No one thought I was "elite" then. And when I look in the mirror, I see the same dude who got bounced. Repeatedly.
tanehisicoates	716758908975579136	2016-04-03T22:46:55	Like I once lost three writing jobs in five years. Was sucking on unemployment when I came to The Atlantic. Failing every way i could.
tanehisicoates	716758694747353089	2016-04-03T22:46:04	Not to engage in this but it's sorta amazing how one becomes regarded as "elite."

tanehisicoates	716611613122502657	2016-04-03T13:01:37	JasonPackman Like I really "like" living here--personally. But I can't say, all things included, it's objectively "better."
tanehisicoates	716611361787277313	2016-04-03T13:00:37	JasonPackman Sure. But that's subjective. Like I suspect they wouldn't say "Japan is objectively better than America." Would they?

tanehisicoates	715885613925445633	2016-04-01T12:56:45	I guess. But I never thought of Amazons as personal body-guards to a dude. Warriors in their own right, no?

tanehisicoates	715883485983059968	2016-04-01T12:48:18	I do think  the concept is problematic. And I think it's important to think about what's behind an "all-female" body-guard troop.
tanehisicoates	715882970993790976	2016-04-01T12:46:15	Anyway someone asked my urge to "cut" the Dora Milajae--T'Challa's all female body-guard corps--which I mentioned in that Times article.

tanehisicoates	715170684524224513	2016-03-30T13:35:53	DrO_aorzoff jbouie What's the essay?
tanehisicoates	715170465749270528	2016-03-30T13:35:00	jbouie Also a very ugly history here that should not be ignored. Redeemers, for instance, talking about civil rights as "special rights."
tanehisicoates	715170140502024193	2016-03-30T13:33:43	jbouie If the people have been brainwashed and don't know their interests, you can fantasize about waking them up.
tanehisicoates	715170037594722305	2016-03-30T13:33:18	jbouie Well in the short term, talking about interests is harder, I think. Much easier to believe in brainwashing.
tanehisicoates	715169896179564544	2016-03-30T13:32:45	jbouie Lobby for marriage equality certainly a "special interest." Also a just one.
tanehisicoates	715169713274417153	2016-03-30T13:32:01	jbouie Strong argument that the civil rights lobby in the 60s was a "special interest."

tanehisicoates	714853640113168386	2016-03-29T16:36:03	Web of Spiderman was great. Got to see the whole cast in effect.  
tanehisicoates	714853501973606400	2016-03-29T16:35:30	Tough for me to answer. Thought this was the whole subtext when I was a kid. Never explicit...But I liked that. 
tanehisicoates	714853371467939841	2016-03-29T16:34:59	Inventorying your comics is awesome. Specifically remember when I saw I had more X-Factor than Spectacular Spiderman

tanehisicoates	714846841020481536	2016-03-29T16:09:02	"Think of how many weak shows you slept through..." 
tanehisicoates	713894323260096512	2016-03-27T01:04:04	Appreciate the nuance, but no. Colorism as discrimination is also oppressive. 
tanehisicoates	713893859336519680	2016-03-27T01:02:14	"...and in front of the public all the time wide open for them to jeer and approve of or disapprove of.” --Nina Simone
tanehisicoates	713893769108697088	2016-03-27T01:01:52	“If I were a boy, it wouldn’t matter so much, but I’m a girl..."
tanehisicoates	713893501633740800	2016-03-27T01:00:48	"I can’t be white and I’m the kind of colored girl who looks like everything white people despise."--Nina Simone 
tanehisicoates	713892903962218496	2016-03-27T00:58:26	Sure. But that's an argument for doing everything from investing in apartheid South Africa to selling crack.  
tanehisicoates	713892408581361664	2016-03-27T00:56:28	It's really not much of a "guess" Simone actually talked about it.  
tanehisicoates	713891126437027840	2016-03-27T00:51:22	BrentNYT tanehisicoates Did you hear producer or whoever comparing it to Kidman's big nose for Virginia Woolf, as in "done all the time,"
tanehisicoates	713889588285149184	2016-03-27T00:45:15	Question ain't "acceptable." It's "How can we not duplicate the same racism Simone suffered from?" 
tanehisicoates	713889346349363200	2016-03-27T00:44:18	tanehisicoates May I submit the following about the "blackface" makeup in "Nina."   
tanehisicoates	713888025080696832	2016-03-27T00:39:03	The part where cats tell me "We're doing this for Nina." Or "Nina's story derseves to be told."  
tanehisicoates	713887873733361664	2016-03-27T00:38:27	No one is questioning anyone's "blackness." I'm black as hell. But the kind of racism I've suffered, at the same as the kind my wife has.
tanehisicoates	713887626357567489	2016-03-27T00:37:28	Nothing to do with "blackness." Simone suffered from a KIND of racism. To precisely duplicate that racism is wrong. 
tanehisicoates	713886165817016320	2016-03-27T00:31:39	I'm trying to figure out if there's some, like, Joaquin Phoenix style performance art happening here. 
tanehisicoates	713885507806212096	2016-03-27T00:29:03	It's incredible. "I am doing this for Nina Simone, while allying with the same forces that plagued...Nina Simone."
tanehisicoates	713885255950811136	2016-03-27T00:28:03	Making a film in which racist beauty standards are an element, and then duplicating those standards is a special level of cluelessness.
tanehisicoates	713884933958279168	2016-03-27T00:26:46	Same parameters that plagued Nina Simone. Gotta be some sort of inverse award for the logic behind this film.
tanehisicoates	713884814730989569	2016-03-27T00:26:17	while money people "don't make the final decision, they certainly set parameters." Right. Racist parameters.

tanehisicoates	713862511028666368	2016-03-26T22:57:40	lol. it's true. but that sabretooth issue is just great. 
tanehisicoates	713861566907727872	2016-03-26T22:53:55	Great issue. But come on, the Mutant Masscre was great at the time. Still holds up. 
tanehisicoates	713861289278369793	2016-03-26T22:52:48	Too many bizarre one-offs. For like 20 issues, no real x-men in the "x-men." Basically took a break until Genosha. 
tanehisicoates	713860310382297089	2016-03-26T22:48:55	tanehisicoates If I were teaching a class Black Jacobins + Avengers of the New World would be read in tandem.
tanehisicoates	713860908112551936	2016-03-26T22:51:18	Never quite felt it. But I was a kid and partial to Storm/Logan pairing.

tanehisicoates	713859896257720320	2016-03-26T22:47:16	From Cyke leaving the team up to the Siege Perilous, it was an incredible run. (Maybe 150s to 240s?) 
tanehisicoates	713859604942336001	2016-03-26T22:46:07	Silver Sabre. Or whatever his name was. That was great. 
tanehisicoates	713858223493758976	2016-03-26T22:40:37	DOn't sleep on Storm damn near gutting Callisto. That's the moment of character transition from padwan to bad-ass. 
tanehisicoates	713857684752216064	2016-03-26T22:38:29	Classic Storm. 
tanehisicoates	713857515776303104	2016-03-26T22:37:49	Man-Ape. Sigh... 
tanehisicoates	713857420435525632	2016-03-26T22:37:26	Claremont's Storm is unlike anything I've ever seen. The powerless era was incredible. 
tanehisicoates	713857218135908352	2016-03-26T22:36:38	that was an awesome era. 
tanehisicoates	713856969971523585	2016-03-26T22:35:39	tanehisicoates I would argue that he was still great even after the movie. Jason Aaron and Rick Remender's work showed that.
tanehisicoates	713857066616668162	2016-03-26T22:36:02	Always. 
tanehisicoates	713856953651445760	2016-03-26T22:35:35	Yeah perhaps. I loved his evolution from pain-in-the-rear to basically becoming Storm's right hand. 
tanehisicoates	713856560913629184	2016-03-26T22:34:01	Been 20 years since I read Jacobins. Not sure.  
tanehisicoates	713856278074892289	2016-03-26T22:32:54	Logan gets a lot of hate these days, but in the pre-movie days, he was such a great character.
tanehisicoates	713856147246215168	2016-03-26T22:32:22	never got the mystique thing... 
tanehisicoates	713856038324334594	2016-03-26T22:31:56	Reading Soccerpolitics's Avengers of The New World. It's stunning. History of the Haitian Revolution.

tanehisicoates	713853419715428354	2016-03-26T22:21:32	Basically "Jeaaaannnn!!!" is the thing that keeps 90s X-Men cartoon from being "great" and just being "excellent."
tanehisicoates	713853176223559681	2016-03-26T22:20:34	Yes. Better than the constant--"Jeaaannnnnn!!!"

tanehisicoates	713851750042742786	2016-03-26T22:14:54	Agree. Long been something between Logan and Storm. Honestly, back in the 80s, I wanted this to happen.

tanehisicoates	713354759936323584	2016-03-25T13:20:02	tressiemcphd Like being shocked that a poor family lives in a poor neighborhood.
tanehisicoates	713354592206123008	2016-03-25T13:19:22	tressiemcphd Precisely. Would be odd for the people to be in crisis, and like, the institutions not to be.
tanehisicoates	713354329877520384	2016-03-25T13:18:20	tressiemcphd And so the institutions follow.
tanehisicoates	713354294024675333	2016-03-25T13:18:11	tressiemcphd Doesn't make it OK. But like black people are always living on the edge--for very clear reasons.

tanehisicoates	712082008500015105	2016-03-22T01:02:35	tanehisicoates when class isnt primary, focus is on how elites experience racism and sexism - working class can only hope for trickle down
tanehisicoates	712082321411801089	2016-03-22T01:03:49	arunindy Yes. Some elements. But here I am in this argument.  Facing people citing the New Deal as an ideal instead of "racist compromise."
tanehisicoates	712081853163954177	2016-03-22T01:01:58	HokuBaier Not much I like. My focus is narrow and--hopefully--deep. When I stray, I end up speaking out of school and say dumb shit.

tanehisicoates	712081308604878848	2016-03-22T00:59:48	oshima9 I'm not sure when I did that...
tanehisicoates	712076788776747008	2016-03-22T00:41:50	Nah. I don't need to be "shunned as sexist" to understand that I get things cause I'm a dude. 
tanehisicoates	712075907381530624	2016-03-22T00:38:20	Nah. I think they're wrong and ultimately short-sighted. Not being "duped."  
tanehisicoates	712075673976881152	2016-03-22T00:37:25	MrsRochesterNY True.

tanehisicoates	712074468420669444	2016-03-22T00:32:37	StephenFrug CoreyRobin I think blacks pols who supported the Crime Bill were dead wrong, and it was bad for black people.
tanehisicoates	712074323192848384	2016-03-22T00:32:03	StephenFrug CoreyRobin Seems legit. I think global warming denialists are bad for the country. Doesn't require false consciousness.
tanehisicoates	712073929926582272	2016-03-22T00:30:29	I've actually always liked that. But it's a different kind of emancipation. And we should recognize that. 
tanehisicoates	712073771918737408	2016-03-22T00:29:51	Also gave them the right to rape, pillage and murder black folks with no consequence. 
tanehisicoates	712072909993459712	2016-03-22T00:26:26	It's like all the research on neighborhood poverty never happened... 
tanehisicoates	712072407113195520	2016-03-22T00:24:26	Not privilege at all. Curiosity. Never apologize for not knowing.    
tanehisicoates	712071275229925376	2016-03-22T00:19:56	No New Deal without the Jim Crow "Solid South." This isn't theory. It's the history. 
tanehisicoates	712070628753448965	2016-03-22T00:17:22	haroldpollack That's my point though. Like it's worth pointing out that there was a logic there. They weren't just crazy.

tanehisicoates	712069732258676736	2016-03-22T00:13:48	Extremely hard for the left to come to terms with this. It's mind-bending. 
tanehisicoates	712068213983612928	2016-03-22T00:07:46	tanehisicoates Nothing special about working class in that example. A broad coalition unified for those goals = equally awesome.
tanehisicoates	712069496941506560	2016-03-22T00:12:52	You'd think so. But, like, I'm being told the people pursuing reparations around this country are "elitists."  
tanehisicoates	712069265281720321	2016-03-22T00:11:57	Snoukabuka Yeah I don't use the word "racial justice." And I shouldn't have used the word "racial equality."
tanehisicoates	712069095596933120	2016-03-22T00:11:16	Pretty good evidence that it was a winner. No New Deal without it. 
tanehisicoates	712067847091056640	2016-03-22T00:06:18	@iamdanielsj tanehisicoates TURNS OUT restricting the benefits of the GI Bill to whites means that other people didn't get those benefits.
tanehisicoates	712068701433040896	2016-03-22T00:09:42	I just find this condescending. Like saying blacks voting for Clinton are somehow "don't realize" what they're doing 
tanehisicoates	712068404614733825	2016-03-22T00:08:31	I agree. I don't argue that reparations is the answer to the problems of capitalism. Diff problems. Diff answers. 
tanehisicoates	712067788878258177	2016-03-22T00:06:05	A working class unified to protect a woman's right to choose, for a livable wage, and against segregation = awesome. 
tanehisicoates	712067522833616898	2016-03-22T00:05:01	It depends on what that working class is unified for. Working class could be unified for some horrendous shit. 
tanehisicoates	712065172869914626	2016-03-21T23:55:41	tanehisicoates in our time of lowest unemployment (1952) we were still preeeetty racist.
tanehisicoates	712067228410191872	2016-03-22T00:03:51	I could flip this and say the same thing. "Economic equality is impossible w\o a belief in racial equality." 
tanehisicoates	712066834795794432	2016-03-22T00:02:17	Tell that to the victims of the Tulsa pogrom. "I know they massacred you but they didn't get anything out if it." 
tanehisicoates	712066457740431361	2016-03-22T00:00:47	Nah. White economic anxiety is, arguably, the most consistent force in this country's history. 
tanehisicoates	712066270565371904	2016-03-22T00:00:03	Yup. And I disagree. "All poor people" pretends slave and overseer are somehow equal. They weren't. 
tanehisicoates	712066073374433280	2016-03-21T23:59:16	It's not even sophisticated. "I got punched in the face. I am still capable of punching someone else in the face." 
tanehisicoates	712065375559675904	2016-03-21T23:56:29	I mean, for a brief a moment the Populist movement. But it quickly turned back to racism.  
tanehisicoates	712064179834904577	2016-03-21T23:51:44	But that message actually ISN'T uniting those groups right now.   
tanehisicoates	712063615982026759	2016-03-21T23:49:30	Sure. But it did a lot of other things too. 
tanehisicoates	712063409517416448	2016-03-21T23:48:40	Yes. And among the people who've historically gained from racism IS the white working class. 
tanehisicoates	712063183406682112	2016-03-21T23:47:47	Precisely. It's not like there's some golden age of black/white golden age unity to harken back to. Brief periods. 
tanehisicoates	712063022362189824	2016-03-21T23:47:08	One of us.. 
tanehisicoates	712062868477362176	2016-03-21T23:46:31	I do! 
tanehisicoates	712062736985939968	2016-03-21T23:46:00	Basically like saying both Ike and Tina were both equally oppressed. I mean yeah, but kinda no... 
tanehisicoates	712062366641491968	2016-03-21T23:44:32	Yes. I completely disagree. Poor whites capable of plunder too. Just a black men capable of plunder of black women. 
tanehisicoates	712062048948113408	2016-03-21T23:43:16	No. This is as old as American racism, itself. 
tanehisicoates	712061812020277249	2016-03-21T23:42:20	Basic problem here is the inability to racism (sexism too) as INDEPENDENT thing, not a symptom of something else. 
tanehisicoates	712061624358666241	2016-03-21T23:41:35	Precisely. But it's not like the descendants of those servants got nothing out of the deal.  
tanehisicoates	712061353289195520	2016-03-21T23:40:30	Yeah way too pat. It's not like being a "black elite" saved you in Tulsa. 
tanehisicoates	712060395754799104	2016-03-21T23:36:42	Also with great respect to dylanmatt the idea that "racism split the working class" is premised on an equality that never existed.
tanehisicoates	712059499922776064	2016-03-21T23:33:08	If disagreeing with this makes me a "black neo-liberal shock-troop" then I be that.

tanehisicoates	710126705013170176	2016-03-16T15:32:54	chinyereosuji in which Saldana holds some privilege for her skin tone &amp; looks. there's a difference btwn her &amp; Uzo Aduba. tanehisicoates
tanehisicoates	710126235964153856	2016-03-16T15:31:02	chinyereosuji i hear you, but to me, tanehisicoates's piece is centered in the broad (black) American context
tanehisicoates	710125826700939266	2016-03-16T15:29:25	Instead of critiquing Zoe Saldana, we need to shine a light on the colorblind racism of the producers who thought it up. tanehisicoates
tanehisicoates	710124375102627841	2016-03-16T15:23:39	What Black Americans consider 'light-skinned' is dark-skinned for many Latinos, here and abroad. It certainly is for whites.tanehisicoates
tanehisicoates	710124028971913216	2016-03-16T15:22:16	But Hollywood has a long history of having white people play POC. It's their status quo. Not just darkening blacks. tanehisicoates
tanehisicoates	710123644421349376	2016-03-16T15:20:44	I'm not saying casting Zoe Saldana as Nina was right. Like tanehisicoates said, they never cast black people as white. A black Marilyn? GOH
tanehisicoates	710123055180324865	2016-03-16T15:18:24	I'm sure Zoe got crap for being too dark in her community or having a nose that was too big, just like other Afro Latinos. tanehisicoates
tanehisicoates	710122751571394560	2016-03-16T15:17:12	BUT like many Black Americans, tanehisicoates assumes Afro-Latinas are somehow immune from the same issues in the Black American community.
tanehisicoates	710122537565421569	2016-03-16T15:16:21	I also like that tanehisicoates shines the light on the colorblind racists in Hollywood who once more privileged lightness over darkness.
tanehisicoates	710122356186943488	2016-03-16T15:15:37	Don't get me wrong- tanehisicoates does a good job of giving voice to the issues Black Americans have with the film.
tanehisicoates	710122018226749441	2016-03-16T15:14:17	tanehisicoates piece on Nina Simone ignores the colorism that Afro-Latinas face. A lot of the issues Nina had are issues she had too.

tanehisicoates	709203603764998146	2016-03-14T02:24:50	Tried to construct a language and a place that was imagined Pan-African. Always saw Latveria as pan-Slavic. 
tanehisicoates	709203253452529665	2016-03-14T02:23:26	It's Wakandan! No, In all seriousness, pulled from a melange of language. Most of it isn't literal. 
tanehisicoates	709202426381869056	2016-03-14T02:20:09	That said, it's easy to talk from the cheap seats. If I write anything one-tenth as good as Priest's worst book, I'll be straight.
tanehisicoates	709202287948857344	2016-03-14T02:19:36	Didn't feel like I needed the translator. Wanted the Panther, straight up.
tanehisicoates	709202014857723905	2016-03-14T02:18:31	"Hate" was too strong. Just weird to see 1/3 of a Panther book taken up by a random white guy. I wanted T'Challa. 
tanehisicoates	709201193537503232	2016-03-14T02:15:15	Well there's also the bizarre and mindless hate for Steph Curry.   
tanehisicoates	709200657585213444	2016-03-14T02:13:07	Priest's run is my fav. But I wasn't into Ross's narration.  
tanehisicoates	709195866599518208	2016-03-14T01:54:05	No idea. But the canvas is going to be large... 
tanehisicoates	709191601847926785	2016-03-14T01:37:08	Should never have ben canceled. 
tanehisicoates	709190132692291585	2016-03-14T01:31:18	Yup. Adowa. 
tanehisicoates	709188047707971584	2016-03-14T01:23:01	Don't think the Norse pantheon is immortal... 
tanehisicoates	709187757390884866	2016-03-14T01:21:52	Real talk: Hardest part about writing him. Don't know if I figured this one out yet... 
tanehisicoates	709187333581631488	2016-03-14T01:20:11	Had plans for him. Then was told he was dead. Actually hoped to repair the friendship. But that happened in SW. 
tanehisicoates	709187089712160769	2016-03-14T01:19:12	Someone has leaked Issue #2... 
tanehisicoates	709186809499099136	2016-03-14T01:18:06	One of my favorite writers. (The Crew, Spiderman v Wolverine, Panther etc.) But I hate Everett K.  Ross... 
tanehisicoates	709186492304920579	2016-03-14T01:16:50	i'm sorry, but no :/ 
tanehisicoates	709186399883362304	2016-03-14T01:16:28	The first panel is the fight. The rest is T'Challa defending his doctorate thesis before a panel. 
tanehisicoates	709186264482914304	2016-03-14T01:15:56	hmm. always thought abyssinia.  
tanehisicoates	709185797757468672	2016-03-14T01:14:04	Yes. Yes there are.  
tanehisicoates	709185530328702980	2016-03-14T01:13:01	It's copacetic ass-kicking. 
tanehisicoates	709185324484841473	2016-03-14T01:12:12	I mean every bit of it. Watch the throne, yo. 
tanehisicoates	709184983315947520	2016-03-14T01:10:50	Who doesn't consider footnotes fun? 
tanehisicoates	709184826113441797	2016-03-14T01:10:13	Oh that's answerable. Hulk is the strongest one there is... 
tanehisicoates	709184684727599106	2016-03-14T01:09:39	It's essential. Art is gorgeous. But the long captions killed me :/ 
tanehisicoates	709184411267375104	2016-03-14T01:08:34	Yes. There will be, as you, say "ass-kicking." 
tanehisicoates	709184003237158913	2016-03-14T01:06:57	Hmm. I considered Hudlin's run a modernist attempt to explore the import of pan-Africanism in a cable news world.  
tanehisicoates	709183344710459392	2016-03-14T01:04:20	Yes. Arc is a post-colonial, post-modern, deconstructionist look at militarism, imperialism and heteronormativity. 
tanehisicoates	709170813010837504	2016-03-14T00:14:32	no idea. but s1 should be done by march 2017. 
tanehisicoates	709170558475378690	2016-03-14T00:13:31	No backstory needed.

tanehisicoates	708691997524168707	2016-03-12T16:31:53	Nah. Just to be contrary. 
tanehisicoates	708691189814398976	2016-03-12T16:28:41	Good question. Stay tuned. 
tanehisicoates	708690921815146496	2016-03-12T16:27:37	Been incredible. Can't wait for you guys to see it all. Preview was the weaker writing, imo. 
tanehisicoates	708690579551604736	2016-03-12T16:26:15	mturetsky Wil_Moss McKelvie lol.
tanehisicoates	708690337326362624	2016-03-12T16:25:17	Yep. But gotta let all 11 play out. 
tanehisicoates	708689891497009152	2016-03-12T16:23:31	Biggest thing was focusing. Not just on moments in continuity, but on SPECIFIC moments that will ring out over the entire season.
tanehisicoates	708689737943482368	2016-03-12T16:22:55	Here is the first rough draft page I wrote for Marvel. And here is where we ultimately went. 
tanehisicoates	708689306978750464	2016-03-12T16:21:12	Someone asked for a comparison of script to images. (Or something like that.) Can do one better.
tanehisicoates	708689186145112066	2016-03-12T16:20:43	all facts. one of the funner parts of this was winding through t'challa's sprawling narrative.  
tanehisicoates	708688672661643265	2016-03-12T16:18:41	Yeah. Has to. Plus I love Al_Ewing 
tanehisicoates	708688493489295360	2016-03-12T16:17:58	Wil_Moss mturetsky McKelvie Link or it didn't happen :)
tanehisicoates	708686401655742464	2016-03-12T16:09:39	likaluca Yeah, it's like Faulkner out west. And with pictures.
tanehisicoates	708686262207700992	2016-03-12T16:09:06	No. I got the sense they reconciled on Battleworld.  
tanehisicoates	708685819087872000	2016-03-12T16:07:20	sad, i think. 
tanehisicoates	708683386806792192	2016-03-12T15:57:40	likaluca Not as linear as Wicked and Divine. It's like stepping into a universe.
tanehisicoates	708683308264194049	2016-03-12T15:57:22	likaluca It's out there. Sorta Faulkner like. But let yourself go and you'll have a ball.

tanehisicoates	708681392377434113	2016-03-12T15:49:45	Read another volume of East\West too. Along with the new Vision and Mockingbird. All thoroughly enjoyable.

tanehisicoates	707929209029713921	2016-03-10T14:00:50	That scene, and what it said about "kings" and "states" in general, is so true and so hard to hear.

tanehisicoates	699348917138432002	2016-02-15T21:45:49	Everything is definitive. No searching allowed. So I do most of my searching  privately now. Not sure that's right but it's where I am.

tanehisicoates	699347080054226944	2016-02-15T21:38:31	Precisely. But  MORE info actually cedes MORE questions. You actually doubt more--but in ways that aren't obvious. 
tanehisicoates	699346333627518976	2016-02-15T21:35:33	Robin Kelly, James McPherson and Paula Giddings all immediately spring to mind. (Partial to history.) 
tanehisicoates	699345975148728321	2016-02-15T21:34:08	You lose the right to say "I don't know" and then opine on everything. No more searching or wandering. Just "Perform smartness or GTFO."
tanehisicoates	699345429377449984	2016-02-15T21:31:58	Sad thing is the demand for "answers" strips you of the best part of writing and reporting--the not knowing, the greyness, the questions.
tanehisicoates	699344954259349504	2016-02-15T21:30:04	Honestly, my only defense against this trying to do something crazy. Like write a comic book.

tanehisicoates	699343842697412610	2016-02-15T21:25:39	Reasons why are becoming clear--there is a market for it. Some number of people actually want to condescended to.
tanehisicoates	699343724183216131	2016-02-15T21:25:11	For a long time I wondered why so many "intellectuals" and "influencers" do one good piece of work and then just start bloviating.
tanehisicoates	699343477516169217	2016-02-15T21:24:12	No because I actually believed something to be true. And so I said it.  
tanehisicoates	699343155796250626	2016-02-15T21:22:56	4.) Mostly because even as I hope to "influence," always a voice in my head saying, "Right, but you could be wrong." 
tanehisicoates	699342908269400064	2016-02-15T21:21:57	3.) Influence in which people say "This dude said so I guess it's true" ain't my bag. Rather force a debate. 
tanehisicoates	699342755890405383	2016-02-15T21:21:20	2.) Worth thinking about what KIND of influence you want to have.  
tanehisicoates	699342605440651265	2016-02-15T21:20:44	1.) Question isn't whether you want to influence, but whether that's WHY you write.

tanehisicoates	697558947398557696	2016-02-10T23:13:07	Right. But I didn't reconsider. That's the whole point. Can both critique someone and vote for them.

tanehisicoates	697460609282142209	2016-02-10T16:42:22	I answered. It seemed weird to not do so, given I make a career asking awkward questions.

tanehisicoates	692466336564432896	2016-01-27T21:56:54	tanehisicoates not sure why reparations in the form of cash is being bashed,

tanehisicoates	692467376122634242	2016-01-27T22:01:02	Reparations paid out by the state--not "white people." WWII interned were taxed for the same fund that paid out. 
tanehisicoates	692466582489042946	2016-01-27T21:57:53	Also live in a nation which plundered Native American nations, hence talking about bankers must be illegit.

tanehisicoates	692466066480586752	2016-01-27T21:55:50	We call it war pensions, treaties and contracts.
