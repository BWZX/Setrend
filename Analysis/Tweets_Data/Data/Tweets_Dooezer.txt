Dooezer	720702562400387073	2016-04-14T19:57:35	AGoldmund angRchen Ariana_Tobin FMcapper yeah most of my fellow interns had finished grad school and worked at Apple on weekends
Dooezer	720700680428744705	2016-04-14T19:50:06	angRchen AGoldmund Ariana_Tobin FMcapper I wonder how many WNYC interns aren't already living in NYC - a huge cost to just move there
Dooezer	720700255352786944	2016-04-14T19:48:25	angRchen Definitely. Bigger issue is probably that there are no entry level jobs in this industry anymore - but other avenues like podcasts
Dooezer	720700088201437184	2016-04-14T19:47:45	FMcapper AGoldmund Ariana_Tobin I'm not sure it wouldn't be though - depends on hiring practices.
Dooezer	720699974686752769	2016-04-14T19:47:18	ecjacobs AGoldmund I was in grad school - interned in undergrad, during a gap year, then grad school (didnt want to leave NYC)
Dooezer	720699812476284928	2016-04-14T19:46:39	AGoldmund FMcapper Ariana_Tobin yeah I'd be curious to know how much they could afford - definitely interesting
Dooezer	720697702011564032	2016-04-14T19:38:16	AGoldmund Ariana_Tobin FMcapper i don't disagree, it just might not solve the diversity issue it is trying to address.
Dooezer	720697438458290176	2016-04-14T19:37:13	AGoldmund Ariana_Tobin FMcapper or will money come from elsewhere?
Dooezer	720697407231627264	2016-04-14T19:37:06	AGoldmund Ariana_Tobin FMcapper If they start paying interns how many fewer internships do you think that will create?
Dooezer	720697269213884417	2016-04-14T19:36:33	angRchen same - was lifegaurding at 6 am and in grad school. definitely is a problem that needs to be fixed, just not sure this will fix it
Dooezer	720696677640900609	2016-04-14T19:34:12	Ariana_Tobin AGoldmund FMcapper it was the recession - also my first radio gig - had done lots of print before
Dooezer	720696076840366080	2016-04-14T19:31:49	FMcapper I absolutely belief internships are a first step - just not necessarily at the biggest station in the country
Dooezer	720695900671188993	2016-04-14T19:31:07	AGoldmund WNYC was my 12th internship - and most of the other interns were older than me. Not that easy to break in there.
Dooezer	720695535141789696	2016-04-14T19:29:40	FMcapper totally agree with that. but i'd guess this means fewer total internships if they have to pay them - meaing fewer feet in the door
Dooezer	720688349158187008	2016-04-14T19:01:06	Interesting people view internship at one of the biggest stations in the US as a "first step" - not really the case 
Dooezer	720687201206595584	2016-04-14T18:56:33	this is interesting and I have a lot of thoughts
