jilliancyork	720897511146328064	2016-04-15T08:52:14	matthewteller ousfourita I think there's a lot to unpack here, probably too much for twitter right now.

jilliancyork	720896629000269824	2016-04-15T08:48:44	matthewteller ousfourita you're suggesting Israel shouldn't be counted as part of the Arab world?
jilliancyork	720896140909142016	2016-04-15T08:46:48	matthewteller ousfourita though plenty of folks forget about Somalia, Comoros, etc.
jilliancyork	720896095363207168	2016-04-15T08:46:37	matthewteller ousfourita ah - yes, I can't think of an Arabic-speaking country that wouldn't be considered part of the "Arab world" per se
jilliancyork	720895865938911232	2016-04-15T08:45:42	It's as if he's never heard of Apple v. FBI. 
jilliancyork	720895273342525440	2016-04-15T08:43:21	matthewteller ousfourita "Arab world" is problematic for many of the indigenous peoples who live in "Arab" countries.
jilliancyork	720893064336814080	2016-04-15T08:34:34	ousfourita also when you hear MENA from now on you should ask "oh, you mean Middle Earth and Narnia?"
jilliancyork	720892639386693632	2016-04-15T08:32:53	ousfourita It's simple and elegant, really. And you can still break down to Maghreb, Levant etc when it makes sense.
jilliancyork	720892353704300544	2016-04-15T08:31:45	ousfourita I mean even like "Arabic-speaking countries" which I find myself increasingly saying.
jilliancyork	720891871866785792	2016-04-15T08:29:50	ousfourita so if not "MENA" we need an alternative to fill its place.
jilliancyork	720891790342144000	2016-04-15T08:29:30	ousfourita I'm sure there are folks in LatAm who feel the same frustration but regions serve practical purposes, business purposes, etc
jilliancyork	720891684683427840	2016-04-15T08:29:05	ousfourita I agree re: MENA as a name, but b/c of shared language, region-izing makes sense at times.

jilliancyork	712072611761659905	2016-03-22T00:25:14	Tell me white people aren't the problem here. 
jilliancyork	712072560276594688	2016-03-22T00:25:02	ergomorphis CCamosy Yeah, I feel anger toward men who think they know what's best when they have no personal experience.
jilliancyork	712072107245572096	2016-03-22T00:23:14	ergomorphis CCamosy You need to recognize that for many women, abortion is just a procedure. For others it isn't, and that's ok too.
jilliancyork	712071805398347776	2016-03-22T00:22:02	ergomorphis CCamosy It's the loss of a clump of cells, and I don't feel anything, you patronizing fuck.
jilliancyork	712070523417710592	2016-03-22T00:16:57	ergomorphis CCamosy and while I realize that would've been allowed in almost any state, I resent having to defend it. It's my body, period
jilliancyork	712070134735753220	2016-03-22T00:15:24	ergomorphis CCamosy It wasn't a loss. It was an ectopic pregnancy and I could've died.
jilliancyork	712068085130330113	2016-03-22T00:07:15	softoff Yeah, but people can delete comments from their own feeds, and I'm okay with that. That should be enough.
jilliancyork	712067995712036864	2016-03-22T00:06:54	ergomorphis CCamosy Well, I've actually had an abortion, have you?
jilliancyork	712013617823150081	2016-03-21T20:30:49	softoff interestingly, the "adult products" bit includes marijuana, even when legal.
jilliancyork	712013519009488896	2016-03-21T20:30:26	softoff yeah, but not every option on that page results in a takedown.
jilliancyork	712012852626853889	2016-03-21T20:27:47	I take it CCamosy's "let's get men out of the abortion debate" is just lip service, since he keeps talking.
jilliancyork	712012662746583042	2016-03-21T20:27:02	ergomorphis CCamosy You know precious little about how actual abortions happen, apparently.
jilliancyork	711998896361377796	2016-03-21T19:32:19	.CCamosy I'm waiting for your answer. If you really want men out of the debate, what on earth are you doing in it?
jilliancyork	711997582868881408	2016-03-21T19:27:06	@IllusiveMrSung Educated, yes. But their opinions will never mean the same on this issue as a woman's.
jilliancyork	711997032144179200	2016-03-21T19:24:55	CCamosy It's merely your *opinion* that abortion is violent.
jilliancyork	711995857734934528	2016-03-21T19:20:15	Try starting at home. Why'd you write the piece if you want men out of the debate? 
jilliancyork	711995782291976192	2016-03-21T19:19:57	znmeb mathewi Oh, you mean the time Twitter caved to Jared Cohen's rogue pressure? That's not "standing up to Iran"
jilliancyork	711995696413544449	2016-03-21T19:19:36	I particularly like how CCamosy points to Europe's laws as if we should magically follow an arbitrary number set forth by (male) lawmakers
jilliancyork	711995621524303872	2016-03-21T19:19:19	CCamosy try starting with yourself? that's a horribly offensive piece you've written.
jilliancyork	711994916453421057	2016-03-21T19:16:30	What CCamosy doesn't get is that we don't care what the majority thinks about our uteruses. It's NOT. THEIR. BUSINESS.
jilliancyork	711994351191265280	2016-03-21T19:14:16	CCamosy Do you have a uterus? No? Then please stfu about abortion.
jilliancyork	711994224141574144	2016-03-21T19:13:45	.CCamosy thinks the Dems should welcome folks who believe that women can't make choices for themselves. NOPE. 
jilliancyork	711992056625889280	2016-03-21T19:05:09	elium2 oh, I know, and agree. I just picked an example at random.
jilliancyork	711991952087126017	2016-03-21T19:04:44	ChuckNoyes And I'll do my own research. It's not an either/or proposition.
jilliancyork	711990590355984385	2016-03-21T18:59:19	ChuckNoyes Why on earth do you believe that Trump is anti-war? Sanders is the only acceptable candidate if that's your stance
jilliancyork	711989824501186560	2016-03-21T18:56:16	ChuckNoyes The piece is alright. It's absolutely not an argument in favor of Trump though, and there's nothing in it that surprised me.
jilliancyork	711989438239395840	2016-03-21T18:54:44	ChuckNoyes The pieces there are poorly written, unedited, and full of bizarre conspiracies.

jilliancyork	711988412186689536	2016-03-21T18:50:40	And Turkey's. MOST tweets censored are due to requests from the Turkish government. 
jilliancyork	711987684554702848	2016-03-21T18:47:46	ChuckNoyes I'll read it, but you do know that's a propaganda site, right? Not a reliable source.
jilliancyork	711987085159370752	2016-03-21T18:45:23	ChuckNoyes which article are you talking about? i didn't see a link.
jilliancyork	711986763477204992	2016-03-21T18:44:07	ChuckNoyes We don't disagree on the problems, so please stop picking fights here.
jilliancyork	711986593788203008	2016-03-21T18:43:26	cyberrights I think Twitter's been pretty clear that it cares more about pleasing Erdogan than it does about Turkish citizens.
jilliancyork	711986432848568320	2016-03-21T18:42:48	ChuckNoyes you can think trump is a lesser evil, and that's fine, but he's still evil, and i won't support him (or clinton).

jilliancyork	711986249893072896	2016-03-21T18:42:04	nobodytheidiot It's female breasts but not male chests, so yeah, I'd call that sexist.
jilliancyork	711986000675938304	2016-03-21T18:41:05	ChuckNoyes yep, but I don't believe she'll cause the same harm to American citizens that he will.
jilliancyork	711985167603204097	2016-03-21T18:37:46	ChuckNoyes Oh, I'm with you. The American left is absurd, nonexistent. But I will not, ever, support a racist.
jilliancyork	711984972593307648	2016-03-21T18:37:00	ChuckNoyes But my guess as to why everyone hates him? Because he's a megalomaniac, a racist, and a liar.
jilliancyork	711984880918372352	2016-03-21T18:36:38	ChuckNoyes I don't care who hates him, who likes him. I'm judging him on his views, which are racist and dangerous.
jilliancyork	711984574830616576	2016-03-21T18:35:25	ChuckNoyes He literally hates Muslims. He has a murderer advising him. Tell me you're not this stupid.

jilliancyork	711983916073226240	2016-03-21T18:32:48	ChuckNoyes Trump and Clinton are both incredibly dangerous for foreign policy, I hope you see that too.
jilliancyork	711983402195533824	2016-03-21T18:30:45	ChuckNoyes I don't support Clinton, do you have a point?
jilliancyork	711968668582805504	2016-03-21T17:32:12	Although, it makes perfect sense that Trump would hire someone literally responsible for the murder of Muslims.

jilliancyork	711956352520867841	2016-03-21T16:43:16	By classifying all nudity as pornography, Facebook is playing into harmful misogynistic conservatism that has no place in our modern world.

jilliancyork	710863461471748096	2016-03-18T16:20:31	mmasnick Yes, I'm aware. Google did, however, try to cover up the process even *after* that story though.

jilliancyork	710071602365333504	2016-03-16T11:53:57	Also possible that I'm overthinking this, and "dick pic" is just cute 'cause it rhymes.

jilliancyork	710071075497840640	2016-03-16T11:51:51	I enjoyed John Oliver's take on encryption, but can we stop with "dick pics"? Most are probably unsolicited and unwanted.

jilliancyork	701405215346421761	2016-02-21T13:56:49	damnclown as I said, I won't stop tipping until it's raised, but it is the problem.
jilliancyork	701405148849971200	2016-02-21T13:56:33	damnclown so while I'd love to see employers just magically pay people more, the problem is the federal min. wage.
jilliancyork	701405074380034048	2016-02-21T13:56:15	damnclown that's all well and good, but it's a far bigger problem on scale and the minimum wage for tipped laborers is still $2.15/hr

jilliancyork	694270162329939968	2016-02-01T21:24:40	You can't walk in downtown SF this week. Mail will be opened. All electronic devices will be searched. Free speech or protest is prohibited.
jilliancyork	694445631696453632	2016-02-02T09:01:55	HayesBrown none of the above
jilliancyork	694443898467401729	2016-02-02T08:55:02	What took you so long?  
jilliancyork	694270162791485440	2016-02-01T21:24:40	deep_beige why, who's your pick for saddest?
jilliancyork	694264543866855424	2016-02-01T21:02:20	Don't Panic. berkmancenter sets the record straight on the "going dark" debate. 
jilliancyork	694228975673999361	2016-02-01T18:41:00	dparvaz I'd love to know the origin story of how this website came about...interview?
jilliancyork	694228263984459776	2016-02-01T18:38:10	Looking to hire a journalist? Some former ajam folks are up for hire: 
jilliancyork	694201642455937024	2016-02-01T16:52:23	And btw, this entire line of questioning was totally inspired by that Bernie/Hillary meme, IDGAF.
jilliancyork	694201568535523329	2016-02-01T16:52:06	Finally: Favorite Radiohead track?
jilliancyork	694201490991255552	2016-02-01T16:51:47	philipberne I'll give Hail to the Thief a fresh listen tomorrow. It's been awhile, and a few folks have said similar.
jilliancyork	694200881261080576	2016-02-01T16:49:22	philipberne even The Bends?!
jilliancyork	694200097962221568	2016-02-01T16:46:15	riceysu :)
jilliancyork	694197715970883584	2016-02-01T16:36:47	Followup: Which Radiohead album made you a Radiohead fan? And is it the same as the first Radiohead album you listened to?
jilliancyork	694197544121868289	2016-02-01T16:36:06	gbelljnr you know you have to answer the question now though. dm even.
jilliancyork	694188272889647104	2016-02-01T15:59:16	Massive kudos to SkypeSupport, who went out of their way today with humor to address a really annoying bug.
jilliancyork	694184118385397760	2016-02-01T15:42:45	gbelljnr but i think what happened is one person retweeted and others joined in. not that weird to me.
jilliancyork	694184015071305728	2016-02-01T15:42:21	gbelljnr oh, I see. I've only met one of them in person and I don't know the rest except from jibberish twitter.
jilliancyork	694183861840773120	2016-02-01T15:41:44	gbelljnr I don't know who you're referring to, tbh.
jilliancyork	694171844723671040	2016-02-01T14:53:59	This WaPo quiz on feminism is based on the false premise that electoral politics are of primary importance 
jilliancyork	694171709327290368	2016-02-01T14:53:27	SkypeSupport done, thanks!
jilliancyork	694170732171931650	2016-02-01T14:49:34	heidimoon Many thanks!
jilliancyork	694170515750039553	2016-02-01T14:48:42	SkypeSupport Why yes, yes I am!
jilliancyork	694170098613899264	2016-02-01T14:47:03	heidimoon You may want to update this page, the links are all missing: 
jilliancyork	694169848897605633	2016-02-01T14:46:03	heidimoon I sent emails already to the membership folks on the FAQ but yes.
jilliancyork	694169788013109249	2016-02-01T14:45:49	heidimoon The only thing I can see there is this. Nowhere to cancel: 
jilliancyork	694169494739034114	2016-02-01T14:44:39	heidimoon Thanks, but I've been doing that, and still can't figure it out.
jilliancyork	694169391441661958	2016-02-01T14:44:14	SkypeSupport Fascinating, right? OSX 10.10.5, Skype version 7.19 (407)
jilliancyork	694168354408390661	2016-02-01T14:40:07	SkypeSupport at first, btw, my password was below your current length requirements but I changed it and that didn't solve the problem.
jilliancyork	694167707176964100	2016-02-01T14:37:33	ReFla5h yep, still did it anyway.
jilliancyork	694167631943725056	2016-02-01T14:37:15	SkypeSupport I have literally had to do this 100 times in the past few months to access my primary account. No idea why.
jilliancyork	694167542537916419	2016-02-01T14:36:53	SkypeSupport The only stopgap solution I've found is to log in to or create a dif. account, then log out, and log in to my primary account.
jilliancyork	694167410098606086	2016-02-01T14:36:22	SkypeSupport So, every single time I log in to my account, the program stops responding.
jilliancyork	694165270663864320	2016-02-01T14:27:52	I make most of my friends on Twitter by posting controversial statements and seeing who likes them.
jilliancyork	694164892102762497	2016-02-01T14:26:21	darth omg hi i missed your comeback!
jilliancyork	694164626641031168	2016-02-01T14:25:18	SkypeSupport I've discovered the most fascinating and annoying bug - would love help reporting it/fixing it.
jilliancyork	694164428783128576	2016-02-01T14:24:31	Why Slate, you ask? Dear Prudence, obviously.
jilliancyork	694163499824447488	2016-02-01T14:20:49	I subscribed to Slate Plus as part of an experiment to pay for more media, and I will never do it again. They make it impossible to cancel.
jilliancyork	694162987146305536	2016-02-01T14:18:47	Nice how Slate says "click here" to cancel Slate Plus but there's no hyperlink 
jilliancyork	694161805648596993	2016-02-01T14:14:06	evanchill no way. The Bends too.
jilliancyork	694161758454296577	2016-02-01T14:13:54	mohamed interesting interesting. I've never liked Pablo Honey but now I'm tempted to listen again. The Bends is my #1.
jilliancyork	694161009888489473	2016-02-01T14:10:56	BigBadSystems That I understand more than OK Computer!
jilliancyork	694148056812421121	2016-02-01T13:19:28	rwdcsw I agree with you, but I'm not continuing a conversation with that 38/28 person. Profile says it all.
jilliancyork	694145060749742080	2016-02-01T13:07:33	jamesrbuk JonathanHaynes alexhern yeah yeah i mean, Kid A is sometimes my *favorite* too, but The Bends is the *best* ;)
jilliancyork	694144586747240448	2016-02-01T13:05:40	jamesrbuk JonathanHaynes alexhern The Bends is obviously the best.
jilliancyork	694143089615589376	2016-02-01T12:59:43	So, that was meant to be a snarky DM, but now that it's public...It's The Bends, obviously.
jilliancyork	694142923043000320	2016-02-01T12:59:04	markscrivens YES
jilliancyork	694141753830420480	2016-02-01T12:54:25	Do other people really truly believe that OK Computer is the best Radiohead album?
jilliancyork	694141606287421440	2016-02-01T12:53:50	HousemaidFear hopefully soon. still working up the guts. but you can always find me at post-conference karaoke...
jilliancyork	694136830246023169	2016-02-01T12:34:51	altquinn bwahahaha
jilliancyork	694136195807211520	2016-02-01T12:32:20	Please, tell me more about how Hillary Clinton cares about people of color: 
jilliancyork	694135232056860672	2016-02-01T12:28:30	HousemaidFear hahaha it's just a hobby :)

jilliancyork	694134007664132096	2016-02-01T12:23:38	HousemaidFear it's down, should be back up later today, fingers crossed. need something?
jilliancyork	694129458740068352	2016-02-01T12:05:33	Crocheting sweaters for cats is indubitably kinky.   
jilliancyork	694128928550690816	2016-02-01T12:03:27	ggreenwald yeah, that part I agree with entirely. but after seeing the attacks on Coates (who didn't endorse HRC), I can't call it isolated
jilliancyork	694128212830482433	2016-02-01T12:00:36	Given the attacks ggreenwald receives by other groups, I'm surprised that he would call them "random" and "isolated."
jilliancyork	694127947075207168	2016-02-01T11:59:33	I agree with much of what ggreenwald says here, but this (image) is unfair and inaccurate.  
jilliancyork	694127574612590593	2016-02-01T11:58:04	rwdcsw ...are guilty of it too.
jilliancyork	694127553347469312	2016-02-01T11:57:59	rwdcsw ...particularly against people of color who support Hillary or are critical of Bernie. But ggreenwald is right that HRC supporters
jilliancyork	694127431955914752	2016-02-01T11:57:30	rwdcsw I only partly agree with ggreenwald's analysis; I've seen Bernie supporters involved in coordinated, not isolated, attacks.
jilliancyork	694127143626895360	2016-02-01T11:56:21	38_28_38 I don't agree with you at all.
jilliancyork	693798830224084992	2016-01-31T14:11:45	But of course we can trust their judgement when it comes to fighting terrorism  
jilliancyork	693781713646911488	2016-01-31T13:03:45	So wait, Facebook banned boobs early on but private gun sales were okay until now? 
jilliancyork	693781502518300676	2016-01-31T13:02:54	I'm 2 weeks late, but sarahjeong's piece on the history of the Twitter rules is excellent: 
jilliancyork	693757393705005056	2016-01-31T11:27:06	ballslicks of course, but he's proven himself at this point
jilliancyork	693757269956239360	2016-01-31T11:26:37	Vetipie I'm a customer, so I used the customer complaint form.
jilliancyork	693422729240940544	2016-01-30T13:17:16	mjs_DC okay, I apologize for the rude drunk tweets. the lgbtq piece, however, is hurtful and without analysis of why BDS.
jilliancyork	693408697264009216	2016-01-30T12:21:30	alexcomninos agree. I think it's deeply unfortunate.
jilliancyork	693406742051459072	2016-01-30T12:13:44	freewimin agree but your point?
jilliancyork	693406485100040192	2016-01-30T12:12:43	alexcomninos because black women are being targeted by them at astonishing rates
jilliancyork	693406073731072000	2016-01-30T12:11:05	mjs_DC you follow me, so surely you know I'm not a fan of your work
jilliancyork	693405761083478016	2016-01-30T12:09:50	danielnazer please please submit to , this is a superb example
jilliancyork	693183773601632256	2016-01-29T21:27:45	To be clear, I left NH 16 years ago but it's still home. My stuff is still there.
jilliancyork	693183244469149696	2016-01-29T21:25:38	decipherstatic plus the general refusal to use medicine to treat drug addiction...
jilliancyork	693183107642626048	2016-01-29T21:25:06	BTW if any journos want to seriously investigate NH's heroin epidemic, I've got leads.
jilliancyork	693182486629765120	2016-01-29T21:22:38	CohibaSmkr NH has been taken over by Trump types like Kelly Ayotte
jilliancyork	693182290483089409	2016-01-29T21:21:51	Meanwhile they all use New Hampshire as testing ground, while the kids I went to high school with die with needles in their arms.
jilliancyork	693181857077334017	2016-01-29T21:20:08	NSlayton meeeee too
jilliancyork	693181543284609025	2016-01-29T21:18:53	JarekFA it's pretty fucking bad
jilliancyork	693181486007259136	2016-01-29T21:18:39	Bless you who have no idea what actually living in New Hampshire is like. Our politicians are all liars, ignoring a growing heroin epidemic.
jilliancyork	693180971680669696	2016-01-29T21:16:36	socallmeshirley no doubt his campaign could've addressed this sooner
jilliancyork	693180821784662018	2016-01-29T21:16:01	Also, no sexism required to point out Jeanne Shaheen's horrible record. I know, I grew up with her as my governor.
jilliancyork	693180323048394752	2016-01-29T21:14:02	BernieBros are horrendous and racist but if you're arguing they reflect Sanders himself you're being disingenuous.
jilliancyork	693179258806624256	2016-01-29T21:09:48	philipberne and I'm sure with my experience I would find them naive and invalid.
jilliancyork	693160949197455361	2016-01-29T19:57:03	The rise and fall of a FoxNews fraud  
jilliancyork	693160565099724801	2016-01-29T19:55:31	malsaafin we must be. I mean, who could ever believe BDS might be about justice?
jilliancyork	693159979033821185	2016-01-29T19:53:11	malsaafin so gross. see the one about the lgbtq left?
jilliancyork	693159557883777024	2016-01-29T19:51:31	.mjs_DC has pretty much built a career on contrarian clickbait. Wow. Such capitalism.
