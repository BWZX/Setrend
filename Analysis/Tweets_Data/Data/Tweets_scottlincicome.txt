scottlincicome	715919970631176192	2016-04-01T15:13:16	LeonHWolf EsotericCD Leon's ff got me a follow from someone named "citizen dickbag". Sounds abt right

scottlincicome	715917132630863872	2016-04-01T15:02:00	FF LeonHWolf bc his self-esteem apparently depends on having more followers than a guy who tweets out trade deficit charts

scottlincicome	715916039075315713	2016-04-01T14:57:39	salimfurth politicalmath bencasselman sure. But you can find plenty of 2011-13 articles blaming it all on demographics
scottlincicome	715915485221666817	2016-04-01T14:55:27	politicalmath bencasselman yes, most studies said 35-50% of the LFP decline was demographic, but the other 50% was often ignored

scottlincicome	712343297168113665	2016-03-22T18:20:51	nicolegelinas circleglider AviWoolf example: 
scottlincicome	712343236963115010	2016-03-22T18:20:37	nicolegelinas circleglider AviWoolf Pretty simplistic view. Most saw various econ policies causing *both*, not trade causing financial
scottlincicome	712327196765851648	2016-03-22T17:16:52	nicolegelinas AviWoolf 4th, presumption that bilateral "balance" in goods/services trade is ideal - also unfounded.
scottlincicome	712326928628260865	2016-03-22T17:15:48	nicolegelinas AviWoolf third, GVCs have rendered bilateral TDs meaningless bc they don't acct for value-add.
scottlincicome	712326789788401664	2016-03-22T17:15:15	nicolegelinas AviWoolf second, no one seriously thinks TDs are mainly caused by tradepol (instead of bigger savings/investment policies)
scottlincicome	712326385260306432	2016-03-22T17:13:39	nicolegelinas AviWoolf just implication that bilateral TD is a cause, not symptom, of macro problems is...unfounded.

scottlincicome	711198382686126080	2016-03-19T14:31:22	BrianRKnight yep. But it's far different from actually building something. As you know.
scottlincicome	711197573055451136	2016-03-19T14:28:09	Yep. It was classic Trump: buy a valuable, but distressed, property; slap TRUMP on it; take all credit

scottlincicome	711187267621146624	2016-03-19T13:47:12	joe_atikian yep. I tweet that one constantly!!
scottlincicome	711187034883411968	2016-03-19T13:46:16	joe_atikian then let's not forget the global &amp; historic trends: 
scottlincicome	711186792972738560	2016-03-19T13:45:19	joe_atikian and, of course, many studies find the jobs decline was primarily productivity-based: 
scottlincicome	711186514781315072	2016-03-19T13:44:12	joe_atikian as we see from your chart, the sharpest jobs collapse came when the TD sharply contracted
scottlincicome	711186201961762816	2016-03-19T13:42:58	joe_atikian which, of course, shows a long-term decline, unmoored from imports: 
scottlincicome	711185159861702656	2016-03-19T13:38:49	richisglorious I recall several issues with that particular (preliminary) study. Other subsequent ones have found a connection

scottlincicome	711171137976176641	2016-03-19T12:43:06	lizpeek the collapse in labor dynamism is almost as scary. E.g., 
scottlincicome	711170555588677638	2016-03-19T12:40:48	And thus you never even start. And US biz dynamism collapses (which is has) 
scottlincicome	711169952582144000	2016-03-19T12:38:24	...which we already know bc 60% of import value is intermediate goods and capital equipment.

scottlincicome	711169353698426880	2016-03-19T12:36:01	Amazing how near perfectly inversely the lines are. Tells us that imports are COMPLEMENTARY goods, not substitutes.

scottlincicome	710239311799652355	2016-03-16T23:00:22	JPaulOsborne didn't mean to imply that you were. Just that the NAFTA stat is wrong. However, Trump's msg IS "trade killed your job"
scottlincicome	710238483919540224	2016-03-16T22:57:04	FredMenachem JPaulOsborne It's a good piece, but the stats on NAFTA are bunk. Trade has caused some mfg job-losses, but not most.
