tomtomorrow	694743487799898112	2016-02-03T04:45:29	jonrosenberg but really, genuinely, sincerely meant it as a commiserative comment about the things we have to do these days.
tomtomorrow	694743296418062337	2016-02-03T04:44:44	jonrosenberg and the point about KS is, yeah I raised a lot and then had to spend a lot. Didn't make a huge profit.
tomtomorrow	694743176704163840	2016-02-03T04:44:15	jonrosenberg I'm sorry it came across as "gloating." I have a subscription email list that I use in lieu of patreon.
tomtomorrow	694742057647099904	2016-02-03T04:39:48	jonrosenberg ok this is getting weird and I'm bowing out, just meant to say: I'm sorry Patreon has such a clueless feature.
tomtomorrow	694741506112917504	2016-02-03T04:37:37	jonrosenberg and 3/4 of that KS money has been spent producing the product.

tomtomorrow	694740855429529601	2016-02-03T04:35:02	jonrosenberg um ok
tomtomorrow	694740720544944128	2016-02-03T04:34:30	jonrosenberg the fact that "Patreon exit surveys" even exist makes me very happy that I am not embedded in that system.
