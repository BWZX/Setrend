mattbai	703797541108891648	2016-02-28T04:23:04	DanAncona Yeah, because you've never heard the term "one percent" on TV. Ever.
mattbai	703795130768166912	2016-02-28T04:13:29	That's bleak. Even for me.

mattbai	703789438476947456	2016-02-28T03:50:52	PatrickRuffini The context seems really obvious. One needn't create false narratives to impugn Trump. There's enough that's real.
mattbai	703787522011299840	2016-02-28T03:43:15	This is media silliness at its worst. I'm no Trump fan, but seems obvious he was being gracious here, not bossy. 
mattbai	703786364903489537	2016-02-28T03:38:39	@iramacleod410 Always an easy answer, but too glib. 20th century is really the only relevant comparison, and this is markedly different.
mattbai	703785140431020032	2016-02-28T03:33:47	Best is hearing partisan pundits blame Trump for new, ugly politics. He is the result, not cause. Might need to consult a mirror there.
mattbai	703780881064968192	2016-02-28T03:16:52	devincomiskey Sorry. It has been a preoccupation of most serious media for years now. I wrote an 8k-word cover in 2007.

mattbai	703772453038854144	2016-02-28T02:43:22	Possible Trump was just telling Christie he could use the plane to get home, rather than wait around. Just saying. 
mattbai	703771298741264384	2016-02-28T02:38:47	MaxMcGloin Wait. Are you saying MSNBC doesn't talk about economic inequality? Because that would be nuts.
mattbai	703770327856320513	2016-02-28T02:34:56	Sanders opens tonight saying the media won't talk about economic inequality. I don't know what media he's consuming. Maybe Vogue.

mattbai	703721502810771459	2016-02-27T23:20:55	I get it, but as a strategy, I'm just not sure voters opt for Trump because Triumph the Insult Dog refused to run.
