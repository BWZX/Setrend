GaryAntonacci	692357268315045888	2016-01-27T14:43:30	mikeharrisNY alphaarchitect Nothing outperforms every year. Only the ignorant would expect that. Abs mom has done well in and OOS.

GaryAntonacci	692355701495205888	2016-01-27T14:37:17	mikeharrisNY alphaarchitect Not true. Abs mom was in the S&amp;P all of 2015 except Aug when it was in agg bonds. See

GaryAntonacci	692311933706334208	2016-01-27T11:43:22	mikeharrisNY alphaarchitect Abs mom is better and stat significant. MA cross is not. Zakamulin tested them.

GaryAntonacci	692068776699785216	2016-01-26T19:37:09	mikeharrisNY alphaarchitect Then I lots of guess out-of-sample evidence means nothing to you
