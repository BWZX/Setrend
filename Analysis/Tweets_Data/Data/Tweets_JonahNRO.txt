JonahNRO	704015199859318784	2016-02-28T18:47:58	That guy endorsed, Rubio, right? 
JonahNRO	704014979977105409	2016-02-28T18:47:05	"He'd unite the party -- in eternal torment and agony!" 
JonahNRO	704014763647442946	2016-02-28T18:46:14	Remember how Trump dined out for *months* on Bush's fumble on "women's health"? This is beyond fair game.  
JonahNRO	704014533623422976	2016-02-28T18:45:19	MichaelRWarren JSwiftTWS Not mutually exclusive of course.
JonahNRO	704011358292074497	2016-02-28T18:32:42	Sad!!! Typical Washington politician WE don't need any more of that!! Pathetic loser 
JonahNRO	704009177073590272	2016-02-28T18:24:02	@elainegibbs5 Not people, who you know, live in New Jersey and remember her as the governor. Or, people who follow politics.
JonahNRO	703989921325957121	2016-02-28T17:07:31	jhinton_ BillKristol Trump IS a progressive R.
JonahNRO	703989611454992385	2016-02-28T17:06:17	.tm11999 I've spent nearly 20 years fighting &amp; criticizing the Clintons. Most of that time, Trump was a Clinton donor.
JonahNRO	703989186337107968	2016-02-28T17:04:36	Good for her! 
JonahNRO	703972455472340993	2016-02-28T15:58:07	Proud to stand with out-of-favor, not-too-clever-by-half, not-sophisticatedly-neutral conservatives in resistance to Trump.
JonahNRO	703972505376178177	2016-02-28T15:58:19	jackshafer I am taking notes, believe me.
JonahNRO	703971633900474368	2016-02-28T15:54:51	When Trump says he merely hired a contractor who hired the Polish illegals, why don't interviewers ask "I thought you hire the best people"
JonahNRO	703967888718360577	2016-02-28T15:39:58	TestifyG realDonaldTrump Didn't say he doesn't have gifts, but celebrities often do. He is transparently &amp; obviously ignorant about policy
JonahNRO	703957556079796225	2016-02-28T14:58:54	Yes, a much, much, much, much, much, much, much more generous one.  
JonahNRO	703957347266330625	2016-02-28T14:58:05	I dunno, lots of Klansmen stayed home refusing to vote for Romney last time.  
JonahNRO	703957066453483520	2016-02-28T14:56:58	Trump has previously sought to disassociate himself from a "Mr. Duke" he now claims to know nothing about. 
JonahNRO	703956362921959424	2016-02-28T14:54:10	Maybe Trump forgot. Oh, I forgot Trump has the world's greatest memory. 
JonahNRO	703954669039710208	2016-02-28T14:47:26	Well, he does say all the time he "gets along with everybody."  
JonahNRO	703931224016838656	2016-02-28T13:14:16	Tell your friends about NeverTrump - on Facebook and face to face. Trump fans on here are immovable, but casual voters aren't. Let's go!
JonahNRO	703931218228875264	2016-02-28T13:14:15	Yep. Remember as realDonaldTrump said, he "whines until he wins." No reason to indulge him.  
JonahNRO	703929235023515648	2016-02-28T13:06:22	Tried to cover that with "ignorant." But yeah, possible. 
JonahNRO	703928922203934720	2016-02-28T13:05:08	Best answer: He's an ignorant insomniac w/ADD who knows little, loves flattery, &amp; spends nights playing on twitter.  
JonahNRO	703725229575696384	2016-02-27T23:35:43	Just a reminder that there's a big gulf between what news junkies know and what a lot of voters know 
JonahNRO	703920647160918018	2016-02-28T12:32:15	Funny how a guy who gathers the "best people" fails so often at so many things.  
JonahNRO	703900320901013504	2016-02-28T11:11:28	Heading back to bed. Canines confused.
JonahNRO	703888311631405056	2016-02-28T10:23:45	Friggin dogs tricked me. Told me it was 6:00 AM, when they knew it was five.

JonahNRO	703884471758667776	2016-02-28T10:08:30	Good times 
JonahNRO	703883541843730432	2016-02-28T10:04:48	This is too clever by half. Giving a bully and boor a taste of his own medicine when required is not hypocrisy 
JonahNRO	703790123977187328	2016-02-28T03:53:36	GRHammersmith will look into it
JonahNRO	703784735651274752	2016-02-28T03:32:11	Nope. NeverTrump 
JonahNRO	703788256719142912	2016-02-28T03:46:10	I find it reassuring, frankly 
JonahNRO	703786238919254016	2016-02-28T03:38:09	Never gets old  
JonahNRO	703044507416334338	2016-02-26T02:30:47	Hey Robert Jeffress and Jerry Falwell, Jr. — Trump is defending Planned Parenthood again.
JonahNRO	703786426102652928	2016-02-28T03:38:54	No one is a better friend to Israel. He was the grand marshal in a parade 12 years ago.  
JonahNRO	703674879321759752	2016-02-27T20:15:39	KatrinaPierson Any answer for me yet, Katrina? Where is the money that Trump promised to the veterans groups. Can I see the accounts?
