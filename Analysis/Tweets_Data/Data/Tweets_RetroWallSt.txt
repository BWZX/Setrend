RetroWallSt	684036418058883072	2016-01-04T15:39:25	TSLA murderlated after ending the year with a strong looking setup on the daily chart. Welcome to 2016.

RetroWallSt	683879160591200256	2016-01-04T05:14:32	Not a huge fan of how so many think the Steelers will just waltz through Cincy. Playoffs just aren't that easy. Cincy is solid.
RetroWallSt	683823667105546240	2016-01-04T01:34:01	CraigScott31 I'll take sunday. Give williams an extra day
RetroWallSt	683822316682256384	2016-01-04T01:28:39	CraigScott31 no. Just guessing. Might wait until tonight's game is over
RetroWallSt	683822063409217536	2016-01-04T01:27:39	CraigScott31 sat 8pm?
RetroWallSt	683810622098702336	2016-01-04T00:42:11	The Steelers should see if Bobby Boucher is available.  We need an RB if DWill is out.
RetroWallSt	683808476296921088	2016-01-04T00:33:39	cirrusdriver just happy we're going somewhere
RetroWallSt	683808239473967104	2016-01-04T00:32:43	btsteelcurtain I can't even imagine AB's stats if Ben stayed healthy the whole year
RetroWallSt	683807433446195201	2016-01-04T00:29:31	And Philip Rivers sends the Steelers to Cincy
RetroWallSt	683792196013670400	2016-01-03T23:28:58	So Steelers could still play cincy, KC or denver at the moment?
RetroWallSt	683784283329171456	2016-01-03T22:57:31	Both Denver &amp; KC want to play Houston, I guess.
RetroWallSt	683772895517118464	2016-01-03T22:12:16	This sums up my day. 
RetroWallSt	683774438865682432	2016-01-03T22:18:24	CraigScott31 give us a prime time slot. Cincy no likey prime time.
RetroWallSt	683754451237081089	2016-01-03T20:58:59	BILLS INT!~!!!
RetroWallSt	683749966456619008	2016-01-03T20:41:10	JoshYohe_PGH glad they made it but that made no sense. 12 and 13 nothing require two TDs, whereas 11 doesn't
RetroWallSt	683738645157691393	2016-01-03T19:56:10	CraigScott31 Ben better give Harrison a handy after the game
RetroWallSt	683738299463172097	2016-01-03T19:54:48	Something is wrong with Ben Steelers
RetroWallSt	683733296337960960	2016-01-03T19:34:55	JoeAballo CraigScott31 I'm doing that right now.  It ain't pretty.
RetroWallSt	683733188951187456	2016-01-03T19:34:30	NO more turnovers. It's the biggest train this game is close.  Should be 21-6 here. So damn frustrating. Steelers
RetroWallSt	683732139670556672	2016-01-03T19:30:19	btsteelcurtain why? Why do we continue to play Blake?!?
RetroWallSt	683730933686480897	2016-01-03T19:25:32	How about a turnover here Steelers
RetroWallSt	683727877293015040	2016-01-03T19:13:23	Note my shocked face :-| RT Mackey_PGH: Looked like that ball went right through Antwon Blake's hands.

RetroWallSt	683684549583192065	2016-01-03T16:21:13	CraigScott31 man, I loved that show. Even had the action figures.
RetroWallSt	683684182183170048	2016-01-03T16:19:45	CraigScott31 and yes, I was trying to make a pun off Twiki with Twinkie ;-)
