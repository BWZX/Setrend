AndreaTantaros	725852133933899776	2016-04-29T01:00:09	When my father passed away, and then 3 yrs later when my brother passed away. Lots of prayer &amp; family.  
AndreaTantaros	725850510675316736	2016-04-29T00:53:42	Yes, &amp; yes. Especially when you meet the person who is far more important than anything else. That's the best. 
AndreaTantaros	725849512443449349	2016-04-29T00:49:44	Greece!  
AndreaTantaros	725849381166022657	2016-04-29T00:49:12	I think it helps people find 'dates' ...or something. It can, but rarely does Tinder lead to long term relationships 
AndreaTantaros	725848428627005441	2016-04-29T00:45:25	It's not easy! Esp if you have a job that demands authority &amp; strength, to dial it down &amp; soften when you come home. 
AndreaTantaros	725847267547176965	2016-04-29T00:40:48	Lead by example. My older brother set the standard high &amp; was an enormous influence by how he treated me &amp; others. 
AndreaTantaros	725846234829828096	2016-04-29T00:36:42	You're a smart man, Wayne! My beloved does the same.  
AndreaTantaros	725845733438578688	2016-04-29T00:34:43	In part. I found many examples of non traditional messengers-even liberals-espousing traditional msgs in our culture 
AndreaTantaros	725844496919986176	2016-04-29T00:29:48	Hmm, depends on how much you like her. But unless you play in the NFL, pick up the phone!  
AndreaTantaros	725843320484827136	2016-04-29T00:25:07	I see it like this: texts are a great SUPPLEMENT to a relationship (esp long distance) but they aren't a SUBSTITUTE. 
AndreaTantaros	725842436493312000	2016-04-29T00:21:37	Major DON'T!  
AndreaTantaros	725841815987970048	2016-04-29T00:19:09	Equal pay is complex. It exists, but there are many industries where women aren't getting paid equal to men. Fact. 
AndreaTantaros	725840356651225088	2016-04-29T00:13:21	Social media has ruined so much. Nobody calls, everyone texts. We're all lazy! It's bad. Intimacy has been destroyed 
AndreaTantaros	725839621574279169	2016-04-29T00:10:25	Of course! Nobody ever says they wish they would have spent more time at the office on their death bed.  
AndreaTantaros	725839404699385856	2016-04-29T00:09:34	100%, but guessing she already sees it first hand. It's jaw dropping how coarsened our culture has become.  
AndreaTantaros	725838345377554432	2016-04-29T00:05:21	Bc the rise of female power also affects men, too! Men often get left out of the conversation so I included them. 
AndreaTantaros	725837497582886917	2016-04-29T00:01:59	Women have more opportunities-THANKFULLY-bc of equality but there's also downsides that ppl rarely talk abt honestly

AndreaTantaros	725363400415531012	2016-04-27T16:38:05	Fitting that the day after realDonaldTrump kills the GOP establishment, former Republican Speaker Dennis Hastert is sentenced.

AndreaTantaros	710160003555008512	2016-03-16T17:45:13	R's ARE right on policy: Constitution doesn't state that Senate must act. But Garland is so moderate that blocking him makes R's look bad.
AndreaTantaros	710158514107318272	2016-03-16T17:39:18	Precisely Obama's calculus: R's will take bait &amp; block a "reasonable" nom. Then left paints them as obstructionists.
