ChiTownBA	704019873446367232	2016-02-28T19:06:32	InterestRateArb lets DM later on this...ill put some thoughts together
ChiTownBA	704015997280395264	2016-02-28T18:51:08	InterestRateArb ok that was my next question, taking this retail would scale very quickly but you'd prob net 25bps.
ChiTownBA	704015489014624257	2016-02-28T18:49:07	InterestRateArb how much you think the strategy could handle AUM wise?
ChiTownBA	704014417420226562	2016-02-28T18:44:51	InterestRateArb strip out the 15%, does the 1.5% include etf exp ratios?
ChiTownBA	704013587564650497	2016-02-28T18:41:33	InterestRateArb you could take this to a lot of big firms man, no one has a long/short etf wrap program I'm aware of!
ChiTownBA	704013080016109568	2016-02-28T18:39:32	InterestRateArb returns net of 1.5/15%? Solid
ChiTownBA	704012830215954432	2016-02-28T18:38:33	InterestRateArb extremely, never seen a track record like that in a retail product. Big question, what vehicle would allow u to replicate?
ChiTownBA	704010777011855360	2016-02-28T18:30:23	InterestRateArb and quite honestly u can just pimp whatever stats look best - sharp ratio, up/down capture ratios, etc. all bout the sales
ChiTownBA	704009542124838912	2016-02-28T18:25:29	InterestRateArb used to sell this crap, can gather big assets if your 5-10yr St Dev # is 10-12% assuming decent alpha vs your index
