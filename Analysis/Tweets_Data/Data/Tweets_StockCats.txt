StockCats	720394357891665921	2016-04-13T23:32:53	Evo_Consultants a reasonable long-term thesis, in the short term anything can happen
StockCats	720394191277154304	2016-04-13T23:32:14	ezfreee of course not, the market can not be stopped, it shrugs off everything and just keeps climbing
StockCats	720393746571862016	2016-04-13T23:30:28	Evo_Consultants they have a lot of fundamental reasons it's likely to go back down, but I don't trust anyone
StockCats	720393324213837825	2016-04-13T23:28:47	I had to zoom the chart out to make sure it was still going from the lower-left to the upper-right

StockCats	720328985805099008	2016-04-13T19:13:07	elwinslow but keep in mind the leveraged VIX ETN's are designed to go to 0 over and over - they just reverse-split 'em
StockCats	720328047296012288	2016-04-13T19:09:24	elwinslow as far back on the charts as I can see it is
StockCats	720324827219791872	2016-04-13T18:56:36	elwinslow no way, when it gets in the 10-13 range it's just gearing up for the next spike

StockCats	720310183574941697	2016-04-13T17:58:25	selik73 that would be painful too
StockCats	720309893236822016	2016-04-13T17:57:15	PaulKingsley16 yes indeed, it's amazing what actually seems to be driving it these days

StockCats	720308028390543360	2016-04-13T17:49:51	awesom_o but that doesn't mean it can't reverse here, let's see how it reacts to the Beige book
StockCats	720307921268019200	2016-04-13T17:49:25	awesom_o we're higher than April Fools' Day so it doesn't really look like what I'd call a double-top

StockCats	720305583530708993	2016-04-13T17:40:08	maybe the "pain trade" is the market makes a nominal new all-time high then collapses

StockCats	713378177687666688	2016-03-25T14:53:06	geauxgunturu thing of it is that the majority of the alcohol business is private and fragmented

StockCats	713368664096043008	2016-03-25T14:15:17	@RADcTION it's so complicated, I'm sticking by my idea our money should be backed by rocks and rocks should be money

StockCats	713358285886394368	2016-03-25T13:34:03	krscapital that makes sense, all that QE and ZIRP bought us a measly 2.4% growth rate in 2015, not exactly what I'd call a big win

StockCats	713356629874487296	2016-03-25T13:27:28	don't hear much discussion about the velocity of money, does it mean anything? 
StockCats	713355357112893441	2016-03-25T13:22:25	so the economy is humming along at a 1.4% GDP rate? that certainly makes the case for a rate hike in April

StockCats	711676943473766400	2016-03-20T22:13:00	Lemieux_26 that's interesting, I didn't go back that far for an analog
StockCats	711663623920349185	2016-03-20T21:20:04	NicoLongShort I also like to check out the Heikin-Ashi chart, that makes it real easy to spot but there's a lag
StockCats	711663233158017024	2016-03-20T21:18:31	NicoLongShort I like to use a 9-ema on the daily and will be watching for a close below it, then you have oil and the VIX for clues
StockCats	711663063322259456	2016-03-20T21:17:51	NicoLongShort then there's the RSI and MACD on the daily chart, which are kinda self explanatory
StockCats	711662685855879168	2016-03-20T21:16:21	NicoLongShort sure, first I'd just draw a trendline up and watch for that to get violated...

StockCats	711655511758872577	2016-03-20T20:47:50	stattaken they are the dip buyers that I mentioned, they 'need' this market to pull back
StockCats	711654204327247872	2016-03-20T20:42:38	AlexFarinelli it's all about the bear skin rugs 
StockCats	711653524640292864	2016-03-20T20:39:56	LWinthorpe you know what I mean, remember the night the /ES tanked on a NK test? Twitter was in pandemonium then it was quickly forgotten
StockCats	711652614392442883	2016-03-20T20:36:19	AlexFarinelli that's exactly what I'm thinking too
StockCats	711652444288229376	2016-03-20T20:35:39	LWinthorpe not much, but say we were in a down news-cycle... DPRK missiles would exacerbate things, last week no one cared
StockCats	711651816098938880	2016-03-20T20:33:09	no reason to try to time the top of this cycle either, when it turns it should become apparent using some simple indicators
StockCats	711650863476051972	2016-03-20T20:29:22	panamaorange DowdEdward ya have to be able to take heat in order to make it through these rallies
StockCats	711650607560585216	2016-03-20T20:28:21	like I said, it could still push a bit higher, bearskin rugs and all - in which case there's support around 2020
StockCats	711650167510986753	2016-03-20T20:26:36	I'm thinking there's a few rounds of dip buyers - the "participants" that missed the rally
StockCats	711649863444930560	2016-03-20T20:25:23	I'm sensing that some people think that when this cycle turns the market is going to drop like an anvil - but I never said that
StockCats	711649594921320448	2016-03-20T20:24:19	ImpossibleBTC I'm thinking the same thing but it's pointless to try to call the top
StockCats	711649285218164737	2016-03-20T20:23:06	biofan1 I'm not sure exactly, I think it starts this week but it's a "period of time" where they stop buying back shares
StockCats	711648915934875648	2016-03-20T20:21:38	cashiusali check my blog for thoughts I've posted in the past
StockCats	711648433426341889	2016-03-20T20:19:42	Flounder6978 it's just my nature
StockCats	711648331123052544	2016-03-20T20:19:18	vexmark we are in agreement, oil and the dollar are major factors here and this oil rally is stretched too
StockCats	711647933473669121	2016-03-20T20:17:43	but it's been my observation in the past that these cycles turn - sometimes gradually - sometimes quickly...
StockCats	711647572570591233	2016-03-20T20:16:17	I'm not sure we've reached the "buy everything" mentality yet but I've been sensing animal spirits, Fear &amp; Greed is almost 80 now ya know
StockCats	711647281129394180	2016-03-20T20:15:08	so this latest cycle, even bad news (which hasn't got much play) has been shrugged off
StockCats	711646978766196736	2016-03-20T20:13:56	I'm also aware that news, sentiment and technicals tend to run in sync, and in cycles
StockCats	711646687257862151	2016-03-20T20:12:46	vexmark yes, that's consistent with what we're thinking
StockCats	711646528209874945	2016-03-20T20:12:08	I'm also expecting a lot of "we'd be buyers on any dip" comments to resurface - from the guys that missed the rally
StockCats	711646229076287490	2016-03-20T20:10:57	a few notable pundits are already turning more optimistic, I was a couple of them on TV wearing neckties last week
StockCats	711645912855154692	2016-03-20T20:09:42	and they guys that have been bearish since SPX 1820 to throw in the towel
StockCats	711645745049370624	2016-03-20T20:09:02	but I'll be keeping an eye out for the big firms to start raising price targets
StockCats	711645529747419137	2016-03-20T20:08:10	but what do I know? maybe the VIX at 14 and the RSI at 70 is telling us everything is just fine, smooth sailing ahead eh?

StockCats	711640449082073088	2016-03-20T19:47:59	the trend is up and you can't fight that - maybe they'll take it a bit higher to blow out the remaining bears and that one guy
StockCats	711640160048455680	2016-03-20T19:46:50	on a more serious note, I'm thinking the current rally is on it's last leg so to speak... the current trajectory is unsustainable

StockCats	711575222814691328	2016-03-20T15:28:48	randadtrade maybe something similar happens, the trajectory of this current move is unsustainable
StockCats	711573037720670210	2016-03-20T15:20:07	randadtrade I'm looking at the weekly chart, the run-up from early Oct-Nov then the week of 11/9 it got slammed

StockCats	709090812446023685	2016-03-13T18:56:38	so when the Fed doesn't raise rates, could the market take that as a sign the economy isn't in as good of shape as they like to pretend?

StockCats	708859527282745344	2016-03-13T03:37:35	JeffCNYC come to think of it, it would be nice to see it stabilize at some point
StockCats	708857681646321664	2016-03-13T03:30:15	JeffCNYC but the recent rise is significant, maybe it will stabilize at some point around a certain level

StockCats	708852271245860865	2016-03-13T03:08:45	LVGS1 I've heard that reasoning used, but this week I think the market is pricing in a zero chance of a rate hike
StockCats	708851427809075201	2016-03-13T03:05:24	2% inflation target here we come
StockCats	708851326692806656	2016-03-13T03:05:00	I'm thinking the "transitory effect of declines in energy prices" have somewhat dissipated - with oil moving from 26 to 38
StockCats	708849272947679232	2016-03-13T02:56:51	stevederico a plausible scenario but never underestimate the evil forces at work here - they could still have a surprise for the bears

StockCats	708847397959548928	2016-03-13T02:49:24	I'm also skeptical as to what they will use as an excuse to not raise rates since they claim to be 'data dependent'
StockCats	708846836145135616	2016-03-13T02:47:10	we know what happened in January but the thing I'm trying to grasp is what happens this week when the Fed doesn't raise rates?
StockCats	708846603516432384	2016-03-13T02:46:14	...so back in December a lot of 'experts' said financials / banks do great in a rising rate environment...
StockCats	708846115077144577	2016-03-13T02:44:18	Thekkw I'm so confused, I heard so many 'experts' say financials do great in a rising rate environment
StockCats	708843466319642624	2016-03-13T02:33:46	xaviferd did you see this?  he agrees with you
StockCats	708843258814791680	2016-03-13T02:32:57	GorillaThumbz wow, back to basics... it only gets more complex from there
StockCats	708841877366292480	2016-03-13T02:27:27	xaviferd I've seen a  few people with that same view, I wouldn't be surprised either but the timing is important
StockCats	708837539529023489	2016-03-13T02:10:13	canuck2usa I get that same crap - I no longer trust them 
StockCats	708834316030095361	2016-03-13T01:57:25	IMHO for rally to continue OIL and Banks need to hold up this week.  So watch them.  XLF USO

StockCats	708801816910307328	2016-03-12T23:48:16	WartenbergHans no idea probably zero too, didn't ya hear, they are data dependent?
StockCats	708801438919561216	2016-03-12T23:46:46	WartenbergHans I don't think they will because the market is pricing in a zero chance
StockCats	708800381204230144	2016-03-12T23:42:34	if oil is headed back to 18 like this guy says   I'd probably consider the current environment a trap
StockCats	708799202512531456	2016-03-12T23:37:53	thought I heard about loans being re-negotiated, extended and pretended, but with oil up +48% who knows?
StockCats	708798922781810689	2016-03-12T23:36:46	so I guess a lot of banks with exposure to the energy sector are breathing a temporary sigh of relief

StockCats	708797343605383168	2016-03-12T23:30:30	cirrusdriver if doing the opposite of what makes sense applies you might just be right
StockCats	708797035122716673	2016-03-12T23:29:16	airdummer the hike was in Dec and all the financial stocks got hit hard / obliterated in Jan-Feb
StockCats	708796453800583168	2016-03-12T23:26:58	dpinsen I'm suspicious of the reaction to this week's Fed decision and also what exactly is going on in the sector
StockCats	708796145187864576	2016-03-12T23:25:44	- they proceeded to collapse shortly thereafter
StockCats	708796101181218817	2016-03-12T23:25:33	as I recall back in December  the conventional wisdom was "a Fed rate hike is great for the banks"
StockCats	708795268846772226	2016-03-12T23:22:15	perusing the charts I see something very strange... the Financials look great - perhaps I should be suspicious

StockCats	708705754870632448	2016-03-12T17:26:33	lynn0p that gives me an idea...
StockCats	708704797424230400	2016-03-12T17:22:45	but sentiment is only one piece of the puzzle - I actually heard a guy say "the market can't go down because too many people are bearish"
StockCats	708704309391790081	2016-03-12T17:20:49	what makes it even more difficult is the fact that many 'experts' have a perma-bias
StockCats	708703863486939136	2016-03-12T17:19:02	sentiment is increasingly difficult to quantify these days and I highly doubt past metrics are as useful as they were ie AAII sentiment
StockCats	708703307527819264	2016-03-12T17:16:50	the inflection points are generally impossible to identify but sensing the shift  close to when they happen works
StockCats	708702781494980608	2016-03-12T17:14:44	I find it fascinating how the technicals, sentiment and news cycle all tend to run in sync - then transition and shift at inflection points

StockCats	708696299835625472	2016-03-12T16:48:59	Yogibear135 that's along the lines of what I'm thinking, it will perhaps transition to a down-cycle in a subtle way

StockCats	708000959037906944	2016-03-10T18:45:57	xjeremymx yeah, I remember everyone on Twitter went nuts that night and then a couple days later no one cared
StockCats	707998244920492032	2016-03-10T18:35:10	SamSaalfeld maybe economics too

StockCats	707764946415779840	2016-03-10T03:08:07	I AM CAUTIOUSLY PESSIMISTIC
StockCats	707984208032047104	2016-03-10T17:39:23	I guess with this renewed 'volatility' the Fed won't be raising rates next week
StockCats	707970674862772224	2016-03-10T16:45:37	rzb240 thx, the market is in a spot where it's hard to tell what happens next, but I'm confident that longer-term we're doomed
StockCats	707969688739979265	2016-03-10T16:41:41	rzb240 yeah it seems like it, doing the opposite of what makes sense seems to work lately
StockCats	707969107124158464	2016-03-10T16:39:23	rzb240 do algos look at P/E ratios?

StockCats	707659110779473920	2016-03-09T20:07:34	TheSolid_Snake does she go outside? or hiding somewhere in the house?
StockCats	707658486985793536	2016-03-09T20:05:05	TheSolid_Snake probably off sleeping somewhere

StockCats	707637260192059392	2016-03-09T18:40:44	megadave5000 yeah, tomorrow the algos will go nuts and I have no idea what they are thinking until I see it
StockCats	707636757211127808	2016-03-09T18:38:44	Tactical_Charts yeah there's always something but I know for a fact the ECB is tomorrow morning and I have no idea what to expect
StockCats	707636210592669696	2016-03-09T18:36:34	gartmanreport yes exactly, at the end of the day of course
StockCats	707635977666232320	2016-03-09T18:35:38	it's honestly hard to have any conviction either way ahead of the ECB, there's just no telling how our market reacts
StockCats	707629984911728640	2016-03-09T18:11:50	beardedmiguel that's a brave cat, usually I'd think a chicken would chase them away

StockCats	707570062140383232	2016-03-09T14:13:43	Tactical_Charts this is still sort of my roadmap 
StockCats	707568502203293696	2016-03-09T14:07:31	Tactical_Charts they probably need to squeeze 'em a bit more

StockCats	707566509573279744	2016-03-09T13:59:36	I'll be honest, it seemed like yesterday would mark the spot where the current rally ended - but then again that almost seemed too obvious
StockCats	707565523786043394	2016-03-09T13:55:41	hope is a strategy?  "futures pointed to a higher open on Wednesday as oil prices rose on hopes of an agreement to freeze output"

StockCats	707348146461011968	2016-03-08T23:31:54	vaheelfan what gets me is when they are all bearish on the market and then rattle off a bunch of stocks that are buys
StockCats	707347718478368768	2016-03-08T23:30:12	UdallTechStrat the problem with having a stance like that is it forces one to defend a prior call without the ability to keep an open mind
StockCats	707347192319746049	2016-03-08T23:28:07	vaheelfan when the SPX was near the lows he kept saying it was going to 1750 and then last week he said it's going to 2050
StockCats	707347029530386432	2016-03-08T23:27:28	vaheelfan there's one particular guy that sort of annoys me but I'm not sure if he was on tonight...
StockCats	707346574721028097	2016-03-08T23:25:39	vaheelfan thx for catching me up, I usually pay the most attention to the sentiment on the Friday episode
StockCats	707345847529381888	2016-03-08T23:22:46	UdallTechStrat there must have been a bearish consensus

StockCats	707270409683673088	2016-03-08T18:23:00	ToddinFL seems like the basic premise of chasing unusual options activity, but maybe I'm off base
StockCats	707263786881839105	2016-03-08T17:56:41	JeffCNYC that makes sense, it just seems like the unusual option activity implies "someone knows something"
StockCats	707263566383091712	2016-03-08T17:55:49	djloche nothing would surprise me and that seems entirely plausible
StockCats	707262880715051009	2016-03-08T17:53:05	seems to me buying a stock based on unusual options activity assumes that someone knows some non-public information

StockCats	707010672736006144	2016-03-08T01:10:54	CramersShirt hey, if you draw enough fibs on a chart the price usually comes close to one of the levels

StockCats	707008648036352001	2016-03-08T01:02:51	roo5guy16 yeah this current rally in oil is another part of the puzzle
StockCats	707007804217942019	2016-03-08T00:59:30	look at 9/17, same sort of thing, the market was rallying off the lows and reversed on Fed day
StockCats	707007605206589440	2016-03-08T00:58:43	so it wouldn't surprise me to see it reverse and turn back down right around the upcoming meeting

StockCats	702852783330955264	2016-02-25T13:48:56	GainsPainsCapit sure, it has an inverse relationship to the purchasing power of Federal Reserve Notes
StockCats	702851994386616320	2016-02-25T13:45:48	my cost of living is in a secular bull market
StockCats	702851857090215936	2016-02-25T13:45:15	here's a graphical representation of that statement 
StockCats	702850669758259200	2016-02-25T13:40:32	Char7man it's like boiling a frog
StockCats	702849887407308800	2016-02-25T13:37:26	inflation expectations - I'm confident my cost of living will continue to rise, as it always has
StockCats	702846452666667008	2016-02-25T13:23:47	Bakedandburnt the easy money has already been made
StockCats	702845930182152197	2016-02-25T13:21:42	megadave5000 definitely qualifies you to have an opinion
StockCats	702729809856696321	2016-02-25T05:40:17	kaneco501_1 yeah I could see that, so I'm not crazy after all
StockCats	702729440690831360	2016-02-25T05:38:49	PsychoOnWallSt I muted the names of the candidates last weekend and I think it made things better
StockCats	702729186180468736	2016-02-25T05:37:48	kaneco501_1 ok, it's a flower, thought I was seeing a cat there for a minute
StockCats	702728501204488193	2016-02-25T05:35:05	kaneco501_1 cool pic, I'm trying to figure out exactly what it is
StockCats	702700789681233920	2016-02-25T03:44:58	TDANSherrod did you know that the indicators no longer show up when you "share" a chart? 
StockCats	702670169164943360	2016-02-25T01:43:17	FedPorn I think they were mainly used so the gold wasn't stolen in stage coach robberies 
StockCats	702667191976652801	2016-02-25T01:31:28	FedPorn the good ole days 
StockCats	702661313626050560	2016-02-25T01:08:06	beardedmiguel crazy article and that part certainly seemed a bit odd
StockCats	702653936726106112	2016-02-25T00:38:47	optiontr8er yes, I keep thinking that same thing - it would be too easy to just completely reverse at the 50-day / top of the range
StockCats	702653665895702528	2016-02-25T00:37:43	Notrequired2 that's good analysis, I tend to agree
StockCats	702639759873679361	2016-02-24T23:42:27	nfraehlich hmm, let me think about that 
StockCats	702638463951183873	2016-02-24T23:37:18	AdamSinger guess I asked for it
StockCats	702635853013782528	2016-02-24T23:26:56	beano629 thx, I missed that one and need to read it
StockCats	702635655088750592	2016-02-24T23:26:09	dmwlsw I remember back then they would say "every dollar rise in oil takes a measurable percent off GDP"
StockCats	702635241777848321	2016-02-24T23:24:30	StriblingClay it's almost like they are going for the teenage girl demographic
StockCats	702635012043177985	2016-02-24T23:23:35	SusanCTShore I muted a bunch of political names last weekend and it seemed to help
StockCats	702634640142692352	2016-02-24T23:22:07	dmwlsw funny how times change 
StockCats	702634271731814400	2016-02-24T23:20:39	StriblingClay but most Gifs are silly, pics work much better for getting a real message across
StockCats	702633892973559808	2016-02-24T23:19:09	dmwlsw back in 2007 rising oil prices were bad for stocks - totally inversely correlated on a day to day basis
StockCats	702633219120893953	2016-02-24T23:16:28	SusanCTShore eventually that correlation becomes less relevant and it decouples at some point
StockCats	702632917982388224	2016-02-24T23:15:16	dmwlsw they always do, I remember when it was the exact opposite
StockCats	702632303902773250	2016-02-24T23:12:50	NecessaryPaper that seems strange, I'd have to think about it
StockCats	702631913312428032	2016-02-24T23:11:17	StockWhale it will happen eventually, correlations are transitory
StockCats	702631585825366016	2016-02-24T23:09:58	UdallTechStrat yeah any real decoupling would send everyone scrambling for a new narrative
StockCats	702631215090810880	2016-02-24T23:08:30	what would we do if one day oil went up and the market dropped? we would have to rethink everything we know
StockCats	702630914090729472	2016-02-24T23:07:18	AndrewDerb that's probably not a good strategy but it could actually outperform
StockCats	702629237409390592	2016-02-24T23:00:39	WeldingYellen don't give them any ideas
StockCats	702629158875209728	2016-02-24T23:00:20	AuspexResearch for a few million I could come up with some better ideas
StockCats	702627245312118784	2016-02-24T22:52:44	DaveHamlin2 absolutely, it only makes sense
StockCats	702627089393053696	2016-02-24T22:52:06	bucwaas actually the indexes are diabolically constructed to always go up over the long-term so they might be on to something
StockCats	702626831263002625	2016-02-24T22:51:05	BitFlippr I was thinking along the lines of MySpace
StockCats	702626417146765312	2016-02-24T22:49:26	steviemccallum this article 
StockCats	702626197780504577	2016-02-24T22:48:34	ByrneRWS yep, that's what came to mind
StockCats	702625815524147201	2016-02-24T22:47:03	24Kt_Steve that would make too much sense I guess
StockCats	702625650390245376	2016-02-24T22:46:23	JeffCNYC when you don't see the Tweets from someone you follow 
StockCats	702625136663461888	2016-02-24T22:44:21	what's next? 10k character tweets with dancing bananas and embedded music?
StockCats	702624535573569536	2016-02-24T22:41:58	it's like they are mass trolling their users on purpose
