Snowden	711685583907766273	2016-03-20T22:47:20	AoDespair With respect, this is far less considered than your other points. Argues that capability matters more than rights. Ends justify.
Snowden	711684130958868480	2016-03-20T22:41:33	AoDespair Reasonable. Yet when even Obama granted additional protections for non-USPs, I'm comfortable with what press chose to run.
Snowden	711683380912525313	2016-03-20T22:38:35	AoDespair I appreciate the vote of good faith. Still, must say impropriety is beyond debate -- programs ended, practice changed--for cause.
Snowden	711682178418151424	2016-03-20T22:33:48	AoDespair This isn't about "minimization," which is a fig leaf. USPs have been, and are, both impacted and targeted. As documented.

Snowden	711576861227270144	2016-03-20T15:35:18	AoDespair Lawyers and policy people are comfortable with "trust us," but the record is clear that that's a mistake. 
Snowden	711575518974496769	2016-03-20T15:29:58	AoDespair Many disagree. And NSA gets metadata and content in advance of warrant, by virtue of tech. Only use ("targeting") is caveated.
Snowden	711574514753208321	2016-03-20T15:25:59	AoDespair Mass surveillance isn't without *any* value, it's just without value in thwarting attacks -- which was the public justification.
Snowden	711573812685508608	2016-03-20T15:23:12	AoDespair Nobody argues against comms surveillance. They argue about scope. Handsets v. networks. "Collect it all" v. individual warrants.
Snowden	711567965783773184	2016-03-20T14:59:57	AoDespair This isn't due to cowardice, but incentives. Human nature, at scale, prevails. Takes a lot of McNultys to overcome inertia.

Snowden	711566599300489216	2016-03-20T14:54:32	AoDespair Communications needs between the groups differ, therefore M.O.s differ. This is why IC is with Apple in @AppleVsFBI.
Snowden	711566143308353536	2016-03-20T14:52:43	AoDespair Commercial activities (drug sales) will always generate records that sporadic offensive operations (terrorism) will not.
Snowden	711565683923034112	2016-03-20T14:50:53	AoDespair Tbf, mass surveillance wasn't pitched to catch "corner boys" or even "The Greek," but on thwarting OBLs. And there, never worked.
Snowden	711563670048940032	2016-03-20T14:42:53	AoDespair Fair point. My background is in intelligence, not law enforcement. Transnational terrorists aren't hurting for burners.
