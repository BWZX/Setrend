WillOremus	726054509210918913	2016-04-29T14:24:19	caseyjohnston mims OK, that makes sense. So it's really about the death of the *uncurated* feed. Which, yeah, agreed.
WillOremus	726054320005861376	2016-04-29T14:23:33	mims caseyjohnston I guess I'm confused about whether Facebook's News Feed is or is not a "feed" by this definition.
WillOremus	726053144883548160	2016-04-29T14:18:53	.HarshilShah1910 Yeah I mean, it's kind of ironic that PandoDaily of all ppl thinks there's no value in a niche audience?

WillOremus	725426693108817920	2016-04-27T20:49:36	CaseyNewton Yes, of course. To clarify, what's dumb are the comparisons that imply Twitter could ever compete with FB on scale.
WillOremus	725423851752951808	2016-04-27T20:38:18	WillOremus comparisons are driven by the ad market, which absolutely compare them. digital marketing spending is a zero-sum game
