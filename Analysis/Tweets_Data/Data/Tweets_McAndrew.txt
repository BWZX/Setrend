McAndrew	701290461462458371	2016-02-21T06:20:50	bermanjeff I'd like to buy that, but I'm unpersuaded. By article's logic, Cruz &amp; Rubio should have done great in SC, yet didn't.
McAndrew	701286166713253889	2016-02-21T06:03:46	KennethBaer Connolly spent $12m for 1 delegate -- in constant s, that's 1/3 what Jeb! spent.

McAndrew	701279351225057280	2016-02-21T05:36:41	DanielLarison Poorly tweetified thought by me. -)
McAndrew	701278105462317057	2016-02-21T05:31:44	DanielLarison That's the good part of Jeb!'s epic fail. What's unfun (to me) is that US democracy is broadly distorted by oceans of cash.
McAndrew	701275694911922177	2016-02-21T05:22:09	blakehounshell It's just 1 failed candidate's tab. Shows how vast are the sums being funneled by corps &amp; very wealthy to candidates.
McAndrew	701250112429826048	2016-02-21T03:40:30	In his defense, Jeb! created more jobs with his campaign than his brother did in two terms, so there is that.

McAndrew	701258468250943488	2016-02-21T04:13:42	McAndrew Interesting. Giuliani was $50M for one delegate but $142.83 per vote: 
McAndrew	701255447605440513	2016-02-21T04:01:42	Fun fact: Jeb! &amp; his superPAC spent $150m to win 93,676 votes &amp; 4 delegates = $1,601/vote &amp; $37.5 million/delegate. Unfun: broken democracy.
McAndrew	701254677254393856	2016-02-21T03:58:38	cshirky With a full flight of wine pairings.
McAndrew	701254179449237505	2016-02-21T03:56:39	KennethBaer Jeb! won 4 delegates, spent $150m = $37.5 mllion/delegate. More than John Connolly or Phil Gramm? (Unless inflation-adjusted?)
McAndrew	701250760047112192	2016-02-21T03:43:04	Update: Politico says Jeb! campaign &amp; RtR PAC spent ~$150m. Divide by 93,676 votes (IA, NH, SC), that's about $1,601 spent per vote he got.
McAndrew	701241526978916356	2016-02-21T03:06:23	McAndrew IA(5238)+NH(31,310)+SC(57,128)=93,676. Total campaign &amp; RtR spend: ~$135M, looks like. That's about $1,411 per each vote. Yikes.
McAndrew	701239161701830657	2016-02-21T02:56:59	Anyone yet calculated Jeb!'s spend-per-vote number? Must be record-breaking.
McAndrew	701237496533745665	2016-02-21T02:50:22	We still don't know who'll get the VP nod. Could be Jeb(!). Could be Kate Bush. Could be Cynthia Nixon.
