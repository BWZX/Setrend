nycsouthpaw	725772793502158848	2016-04-28T19:44:52	Fifth, what the court doesn't seem to have considered is whether having oral sex with an unconscious person constitutes the use of force.
nycsouthpaw	725772335744180224	2016-04-28T19:43:03	Fourth, this decision is based on the absence from 21-888 of an element (highlighted) that appears in 21-1111. 
nycsouthpaw	725770900143001601	2016-04-28T19:37:21	Third--an aside--Oklahoma statutes are strange. E.g. can you tell me what specific conduct is forbidden by this? 
nycsouthpaw	725770181339942915	2016-04-28T19:34:30	The correct citations appear to be s21-888 (forcible sodomy) and s21-1111 (rape by instrumentation), not 22-888 and 22-1111.
nycsouthpaw	725769640140505089	2016-04-28T19:32:21	Second, based on the Oklahoma legislature's website , it appears the court cited the applicable statutes incorrectly.
