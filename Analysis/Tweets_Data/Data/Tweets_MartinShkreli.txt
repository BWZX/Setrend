MartinShkreli	719914329399762944	2016-04-12T15:45:26	One certainly can get patents on vaccines, toilet paper or whatever is filed for. Whether they protect is the Q.

MartinShkreli	719894554879651842	2016-04-12T14:26:51	Pres_god who doesn't support vaccines?
MartinShkreli	719893856746123264	2016-04-12T14:24:05	Vaccines are tremendously difficult to make. Large-scale manufacturing (antigen production), sterility, ensuring antigen is truly dead, etc.
MartinShkreli	719892153669939200	2016-04-12T14:17:19	Further, proving "sameness" with rudimentary biologics (let alone vaccines) is not achievable even today. Sigh.
MartinShkreli	719891962229338112	2016-04-12T14:16:33	Vaccines are hard-to-make biologics that require extremely large scale (hundreds of millions of doses) manufacturing barriers to entry.

MartinShkreli	719887695561015296	2016-04-12T13:59:36	Finally, if the last example of drug discovery altruism you can find was in the 1950s, you may want to rethink your position.

MartinShkreli	714578561475223552	2016-03-28T22:22:59	trav_boi ZacharyBrennan guess the question is how many patients were on before and how would we know that information. does anyone know?

MartinShkreli	694230155825324032	2016-02-01T18:45:41	Just watched  Vice's piece with MartinShkreli  It exposes that how selective information provided by media is biased. Cheers mate👍

MartinShkreli	694167481078935552	2016-02-01T14:36:39	MartinShkreli isn't the bad guy everyone makes him out to be. Media manipulation is a bitch.
MartinShkreli	694159100255408128	2016-02-01T14:03:21	MartinShkreli she seriously embarrassed herself. Ride someone else's coat tails. Hard to watch.
MartinShkreli	694070358484217856	2016-02-01T08:10:43	MartinShkreli is a perfect example of how the media can manipulate the public's thoughts on an issue by selectively exposing information
MartinShkreli	694100390933958657	2016-02-01T10:10:03	I actually look up to MartinShkreli after the VICE interview. Hopefully the second version of the drugs works out!
MartinShkreli	694132437161545729	2016-02-01T12:17:24	To be honest, I don't think MartinShkreli deserves all the hate. Have you seen the Vice video? He really makes a lot of sense.
MartinShkreli	694029330184155136	2016-02-01T05:27:41	The vice video about MartinShkreli made me rethink my opinion on Martin, he actually seems like a pretty cool guy

MartinShkreli	694027294617133056	2016-02-01T05:19:36	MartinShkreli is actually the hero this country deserves. Insane to realize how blinded a lot of ppl (including myself) were by the news
MartinShkreli	694010670464004096	2016-02-01T04:13:32	Vice interview with MartinShkreli was refreshing. Smart guy who isn't evil. Drug price rise affects rich corporations not everyday ppl
