ericries	719500199966744576	2016-04-11T12:19:49	8. Local factors that do matter were: amt of local govt spending, pop density, % of college grads, % of immigrants. All GOOD for lifespan.
ericries	719497648496123908	2016-04-11T12:09:41	5. Also surprisingly: greater residential segregation by income did not correlate w lower lifespan --if anything, life span was higher (?!)
ericries	719496563740045314	2016-04-11T12:05:23	4. Level of income inequality, religiosity, or racial concentration were NOT independently associated w lifespan (surprisingly).
ericries	719495908824596481	2016-04-11T12:02:46	3. Where you live matters a lot -- if you are low income. You have the lowest life expectancy in: NV, IN, OK. Highest in: CA, NY, VT.

ericries	687857602357624833	2016-01-15T04:43:26	alextsebastian yeah not a lot of people buying paper dollars for more or less than $1
ericries	687800789331357696	2016-01-15T00:57:41	ericries Agreed. It would create a lot of value. Have you seen this Eric? The guy works at the Fed actually! 
ericries	687799198654185472	2016-01-15T00:51:22	And there you have it: fully p2p, secure, transparent, ownerless but with stable prices and good macroeconomics. FedCoin
ericries	687798820789325824	2016-01-15T00:49:52	It's not so different from how reserve banking works today. Banks are like nodes, they implement Fed policy in order to get access to $
ericries	687798382274809856	2016-01-15T00:48:07	Why would anyone use FedCoin instead of bitcoin? Because the central bank would accept FedCoins as payment for govt debts &amp; services
ericries	687798129358315520	2016-01-15T00:47:07	(Being the first node to "mine" the new signed policy statement would be equivalent to solving the current hash problem, with same reward)
ericries	687797852257439744	2016-01-15T00:46:01	A central bank could publish its public key and periodically tune the policy of its mining nodes without having to build the infrastructure
ericries	687797600611733505	2016-01-15T00:45:01	Today this is implicit in what software it runs. But it could be made explicit by adding signed policy statements to the blockchain.
ericries	687797383527190528	2016-01-15T00:44:09	Every Bitcoin node effectively subscribes to an economic policy: inflation (how many coins can circulate) and growth (mining difficulty)
ericries	687790413869133825	2016-01-15T00:16:27	I keep meaning to write a blog post about FedCoin- how a central bank could manage a blockchain without many of the problems of Bitcoin.
