film_girl	725069231688142848	2016-04-26T21:09:10	Tim: Apple Watch. Unit sales met expectations in quarter. For some color, expected seasonality to be similar to iPod.

film_girl	722968034672033793	2016-04-21T01:59:46	cschanck liamboluk I had a conversation with Kevin Tsujihara like 5 years ago re: both TVE and UltraViolet.
film_girl	722966849953107968	2016-04-21T01:55:03	RyanFerguson83 liamboluk yes you can, but not all apps offer the same features.
film_girl	722963282626117633	2016-04-21T01:40:53	8/ The authentication process is only a small part of the problem. The whole experience is fractured, inconsistent, unpredictable
film_girl	722960564033474561	2016-04-21T01:30:05	7/ While (most) networks criticize and sound the alarm on Netflix, they do little to nothing to actual help consumers watch their content
film_girl	722960563207213056	2016-04-21T01:30:04	6/ Today, consumers have an abundance of content at their fingertips. Friction plays a critical role in what they do and don't watch.
film_girl	722960562611605509	2016-04-21T01:30:04	5/ When TV was the only real video content available, networks could make consumers jump through hoops to entertain themselves
film_girl	722960561957277697	2016-04-21T01:30:04	4/ AMC, which has the most popular show on TV (especially among young audiences) doesn't have a Fire TV or Apple TV app
film_girl	722960559918833665	2016-04-21T01:30:04	3/ Comedy Central allows for live TV Everywhere viewing on iPad, but not on web. Most (e.g FX) allow web &amp; mobile, but not Apple/Fire TV
film_girl	722960559210024961	2016-04-21T01:30:03	2/ Time Warner Cable's 10M customers can't watch any authenticated/TV Everywhere Turner or Disney-ABC networks

film_girl	721452635241340929	2016-04-16T21:38:06	gfunkdave SwiftOnSecurity right. Like, if you need Fort Knox, you should probably use signal or telegram
film_girl	721452224312795137	2016-04-16T21:36:28	Other options: Jurassic park, Romeo + Juliet, minority report, alien, aliens, batman, beetlejuice, best in show

film_girl	721451192258207745	2016-04-16T21:32:22	gfunkdave SwiftOnSecurity obviously solutions like signal/telegram are going to have the potential to be more secure
film_girl	721451092073062401	2016-04-16T21:31:58	gfunkdave SwiftOnSecurity sure, they could. I don't think there is any reason to believe they do or would do that.

film_girl	721416638482874368	2016-04-16T19:15:04	rosyna I think it's just the lab
film_girl	721416196612960256	2016-04-16T19:13:19	The success of the iPhone also let them build goodwill in a way other manufacturers haven't. But they do validated testing onsite
film_girl	721415959714529280	2016-04-16T19:12:22	Apple controls its updates sans carriers because it has bout it's own testing labs. This lets them bypass the carrier bottleneck.

film_girl	721371855219634181	2016-04-16T16:17:07	IanGertler jmilbery Pebble was smart enough to do that, as an example
film_girl	721371488763273217	2016-04-16T16:15:40	IanGertler jmilbery which was my original point. You get that many pre-orders, IMMEDIATELY get the equal amount from VC for cushion
film_girl	721371382341173248	2016-04-16T16:15:14	IanGertler jmilbery see I think that assumes they had funding partners. I don’t think they did.
film_girl	721371247896965120	2016-04-16T16:14:42	AnnaHolmes if you’re going to be held up, at least got Thin Mints (and hopefully Tagalongs too)
film_girl	721371012256772096	2016-04-16T16:13:46	Also, my Apple security deep dive article was the edited version. Cut an entire section so it wouldn’t be 2700 words 
film_girl	721370763232546816	2016-04-16T16:12:47	SamTheGeek right!
film_girl	721370703509868545	2016-04-16T16:12:32	IanGertler jmilbery no, they weren’t. They simply vastly underestimated how much it would cost to make these things at that scale

film_girl	721370071696736256	2016-04-16T16:10:02	mikbre I’m absolutely positive you could stop taking pre-orders or close a campaign early
film_girl	721369971444461569	2016-04-16T16:09:38	jmilbery IanGertler but if you’ve got $13m in pre-orders, you need to start looking at a very good ODM ASAP, esp if you’re new at this
film_girl	721369870126845952	2016-04-16T16:09:14	jmilbery IanGertler now, you could potentially re-engineer later to make something more efficient/cheaper to make
film_girl	721369779194310656	2016-04-16T16:08:52	jmilbery IanGertler exactly. With hardware, esp. when part costs can fluctuate, you need to have a better strategy at the offset
film_girl	721369632796332032	2016-04-16T16:08:17	IanGertler jmilbery yes, but if you raise this much capital, looking at your ODM options is just smart
film_girl	721369214536159232	2016-04-16T16:06:37	Fair, but if you’re not prepared for that, maybe don’t raise $13m   
film_girl	721368460555476992	2016-04-16T16:03:38	kevinmarks BenedictEvans dude that comic was the first thing I thought when I saw Benedict’s post!
film_girl	721368335049306112	2016-04-16T16:03:08	Because the logistical challenges increase by an order of magnitude
film_girl	721368239041679360	2016-04-16T16:02:45	I also think an undersold story of Kickstarter is what happens when your smallish project becomes big time
film_girl	721368169806303232	2016-04-16T16:02:28	Absolutely, so much of this was about over-promising in the hype for sales 
film_girl	721368077208723456	2016-04-16T16:02:06	Absolutely, but let’s be very real: it looks terrible when your most-funded project is a failure 
film_girl	721367647665922048	2016-04-16T16:00:24	If they had been really smart, they would have designed it and then outsourced manufacturing to an experienced co. 
film_girl	721367909864312832	2016-04-16T16:01:26	jmilbery 1000% agree. It’s insane they got all that money and didn’t do that
film_girl	721367599548747776	2016-04-16T16:00:12	This is exactly it  
film_girl	721367500600938497	2016-04-16T15:59:49	But it a $13m failure is bad and makes the whole crowdfunding model look bad b/c there is no protection for investors
film_girl	721367401363742721	2016-04-16T15:59:25	Like, this is the nature of Kickstarter, and you have to accept that for better or worse
film_girl	721367352994992128	2016-04-16T15:59:13	It definitely is, but you *hope* anyone who raises that much will be more competent 
film_girl	721367126838157312	2016-04-16T15:58:20	The fact that they even think this is an OK solution is sad, but I get it, founders are stressed 
film_girl	721367009288523776	2016-04-16T15:57:52	Instead, any chance they have of getting major funding is now ruined b/c they are the guys who raised $13m and still can’t afford to ship
film_girl	721366894507208704	2016-04-16T15:57:24	That way, they’d have the cushion to ship to the pre-orders while raising the price on Amazon
film_girl	721366824638525441	2016-04-16T15:57:07	Frankly, if Cooler had been smart, they would have taken that $13m Kickstarter funding and then gone to major VCs for more money
film_girl	721366722628812801	2016-04-16T15:56:43	Is just as bad. Cooler should have realized its cost issues earlier and told people the truth earlier
film_girl	721366633231441924	2016-04-16T15:56:22	But on the other hand, the idea that people who paid money 2 years ago should have to wait another 18 months b/c the company is incompetent
film_girl	721366548112211969	2016-04-16T15:56:02	On the one hand, I think the doxxing and personal threats are insane. It’s a Cooler. Don’t dox people over $200.
film_girl	721366410287394817	2016-04-16T15:55:29	The Cooler Kickstarter saga is insane. Product raised $13m and the company didn’t know it couldn’t sell that many at that price

film_girl	719635906597109760	2016-04-11T21:19:04	Side note: I still really, really, really want to write a screenplay for a Ponzi biopic
film_girl	719635803626991616	2016-04-11T21:18:40	I’m really disappointed more of you didn’t like my Charles Ponzi reference.

film_girl	719634170801233921	2016-04-11T21:12:11	To be clear, I totally don’t regret buying my Apple Watch. I just wonder if the FOMO factor wasn’t enough
film_girl	719634037707522048	2016-04-11T21:11:39	MikeWehner yah I’m working on my Apple Watch One Year Later assessment. I still wear it but I can’t say it changed my life
film_girl	719633736686505984	2016-04-11T21:10:27	As I wrote last year, the FOMO factor was very much about needing it at that moment. Those delays hurt
film_girl	719633665735716869	2016-04-11T21:10:10	I do think the delay on watch bands — including the one I ordered (I later ordered a different model to get my watch faster) probably hurt
film_girl	719633510735167488	2016-04-11T21:09:33	Because a year after the Apple Watch, FOMO was what brought me in for sure.
film_girl	719633397342171136	2016-04-11T21:09:06	A year later, I think my Apple Watch FOMO story shows both why I bought a watch and why maybe others haven’t

film_girl	718096081880526849	2016-04-07T15:20:22	johnkestner DrPizza I think the Amazon Echo is our best hope right now. It’s the only real “smart” device I use aside from my Hue bulbs

film_girl	718094543728558080	2016-04-07T15:14:15	uliwitness post DivX 4 DivX wasn’t really the same thing. It became a commercial DRMed format
film_girl	718094470785400832	2016-04-07T15:13:58	uliwitness which is basically what I just said :) (I was there for all of this and remember it intimately)
film_girl	718093885097054208	2016-04-07T15:11:38	uliwitness it became Xvid as a codec and the other version was commercialized with weird DRM. Which was, weird
film_girl	718093800804130816	2016-04-07T15:11:18	LOL. No! 
film_girl	718093671049125889	2016-04-07T15:10:47	johnkestner I think that would be genius
film_girl	718093634097311745	2016-04-07T15:10:38	The DIVX I’m referring to should not be confused with the codec DivX. Totally, totally different
film_girl	718093571103014912	2016-04-07T15:10:23	themoralskeptic different DIVX
film_girl	718093542485278722	2016-04-07T15:10:16	unixninjax it was truly one of the more asinine product lines. It tried to compete with DVD while also sort of being compatible? So 1998
film_girl	718093399765684224	2016-04-07T15:09:42	uliwitness heh, different DIVX. Different DIVX :)
film_girl	718093281133920256	2016-04-07T15:09:14	unixninjax it was a terrible/stupid idea, especially when you could rent a real DVD for the same price
film_girl	718093220396314626	2016-04-07T15:08:59	unixninjax they were sold in Circuit City stores and you had to keep your player plugged into a phone line, which in 1998 was  big ask
film_girl	718093142571016192	2016-04-07T15:08:41	unixninjax this DIVX was a DVD that you rented that self-destructed after 48 hours. As in the content stopped playing
film_girl	718093067031588864	2016-04-07T15:08:23	unixninjax you’re thinking of the codec not the rental scheme which was NEVER successful
film_girl	718093021842128897	2016-04-07T15:08:12	unixninjax you’re thinking of the wrong DIVX
film_girl	718092638000390144	2016-04-07T15:06:41	brianallentech but customer service didn’t help of course
film_girl	718092611475652609	2016-04-07T15:06:34	brianallentech which led to a huge drop in revenue. Which coupled with debt loads/2008 economy led to collapse
film_girl	718092541296513026	2016-04-07T15:06:18	brianallentech yes, but the bigger thing was losing more than $1b on DIVX. They had to exit appliances as a result
film_girl	718092269803479040	2016-04-07T15:05:13	And keep in mind DIVX was such a fiasco, it set off the chain of events that led to Circuit City’s bankruptcy years later
film_girl	718092145471696897	2016-04-07T15:04:43	A friend of mine had one of those DIVX DVD players b/c they were sold cut-rate by Circuit City. Worked for years
film_girl	718092054644068354	2016-04-07T15:04:21	Like, DIVX is considered (rightly) one of the biggest tech fails ever. Terrible idea and execution. But those players didn’t brick.
film_girl	718091961350111232	2016-04-07T15:03:59	Just made the realization that DIVX’s demise in 1999 was handled better than Revolv’s demise in 2016. That’s damning as johnkestner says
film_girl	718091803514310657	2016-04-07T15:03:22	johnkestner it really is. This was in 1999. So 16 years ago, we did better.  
film_girl	718091298905960448	2016-04-07T15:01:21	johnkestner until this moment I’d actually forgotten that Divx actually did the right thing for its users. And Nest didn’t
film_girl	718091102943887360	2016-04-07T15:00:35	DrPizza johnkestner I agree. I also fear that sort of intrusion would prevent some people from even trying
film_girl	718090946529927168	2016-04-07T14:59:57	johnkestner Even Divx — the terrible DVD thing not the codec — updated all those players to play DVDs after the format fucking died
film_girl	718090865986641925	2016-04-07T14:59:38	johnkestner before. In the old days, the service shuts down, the device itself probably works
film_girl	718090808491159552	2016-04-07T14:59:24	johnkestner but I 100% agree they should start designing around longevity. This is a new problem b/c we haven’t really had to address this
film_girl	718090715520245762	2016-04-07T14:59:02	johnkestner b/c I could manufacturers just start developing around those dates and refuse to improve old stuff, which doesn’t help
film_girl	718090497860960256	2016-04-07T14:58:10	johnkestner I will say I *really* don’t like the idea of government sanctioned “support” periods b/c I think that could stifle innovation
film_girl	718090246236291077	2016-04-07T14:57:10	johnkestner startup, but it’s a great point
film_girl	718090207917117441	2016-04-07T14:57:01	johnkestner even though I love it. But you’re right, as reviewers we should demand it — it’s hard to do that depending not he nature of the
film_girl	718090136148434946	2016-04-07T14:56:44	johnkestner I totally agree. I wrote this in January about why I would never buy Samsung’s super fridge

film_girl	717855900820705281	2016-04-06T23:25:58	brianmcc haha!
film_girl	717854636460400640	2016-04-06T23:20:57	brianmcc (and yes, I know I just insulted a lot of Blur/Oasis fans by calling them ‘90s Brit Pop but they were part of that movement)
film_girl	717854437201543168	2016-04-06T23:20:09	brianmcc um, yes. I was too American to take real sides in the Blur/Oasis war but I was so there for it
film_girl	717854282565943296	2016-04-06T23:19:32	But for reals this post is great 
film_girl	717853186627907584	2016-04-06T23:15:11	brianmcc side tangent, Tori live, playing two pianos at once is the most impressive thing I’ve ever seen on stage
film_girl	717853119707811840	2016-04-06T23:14:55	brianmcc and like, perfect analogy
film_girl	717853096970428416	2016-04-06T23:14:50	brianmcc EXACTLY.
film_girl	717852743201910784	2016-04-06T23:13:25	brianmcc but obviously no Elliott. But like, who was/is?
film_girl	717852702680686592	2016-04-06T23:13:16	brianmcc amazing songwriter. O is one of the best debut albums ever
film_girl	717852488636956672	2016-04-06T23:12:25	You also have to think 9 Crimes was literally written/recorded by Lisa and Damien while they were like breaking up, which is just like GAH
film_girl	717852348681494529	2016-04-06T23:11:51	Like I know “9” was no “O” but it was a good album. 9 Crimes is still a fucking great song
film_girl	717852286387662849	2016-04-06T23:11:36	Random Wednesday thought: 9 by Damien Rice is one of 2006’s more underrated albums

film_girl	717432309436256262	2016-04-05T19:22:46	rosyna I mean, it wasn’t a huge success, clearly
film_girl	717432066858725376	2016-04-05T19:21:48	mcelhearn ahh, PS/2 - that actually makes more sense than Serial
film_girl	717431909735907328	2016-04-05T19:21:11	rosyna lol. I mean, the fact that they even added Mac support in 2001 is :clapping:
film_girl	717431756325003264	2016-04-05T19:20:34	mcelhearn I know they made a USB adaptor but I could have sworn it had a bigger dongle on the end
film_girl	717431671109390336	2016-04-05T19:20:14	mcelhearn looked very similar! But this was USB — wasn’t the first CueCat serial?

film_girl	717430824908533760	2016-04-05T19:16:52	rosyna what is so odd is that they updated the website like 2 or 3 weeks before shuttering the service
film_girl	717430614459342848	2016-04-05T19:16:02	rosyna yah, about a year — maybe slightly more. I got mine in fall 2000 and it was dead by fall 2001
film_girl	717430450839490560	2016-04-05T19:15:23	The most notable thing about eMarker was that Sony decided to refund everyone’s money after they shuttered the service

film_girl	717429132326526977	2016-04-05T19:10:08	YES YES YES  
film_girl	717429033303162880	2016-04-05T19:09:45	The service was shuttered in summer 2001 and Sony refunded the purchase price to owners
film_girl	717428940202237952	2016-04-05T19:09:23	It was like $20 and it was a USB thing that was a timestamp that called to a website that told you what song played on the station

film_girl	717406314406789120	2016-04-05T17:39:28	nkulw anildash like even if you don’t think they are on the same level (and I don’t), it’s not as if SV isn’t worthy of critique
film_girl	717406218466103296	2016-04-05T17:39:05	nkulw anildash I do think the broader question of why we just ignore SV and its banking backers is interesting tho
film_girl	717405910319177728	2016-04-05T17:37:52	nkulw anildash like, obviously the banks go beyond just housing
film_girl	717405863263281153	2016-04-05T17:37:41	nkulw anildash that’s VERY true, but the intersection even know between the banks and unicorns is substantive right?

film_girl	717393633599746048	2016-04-05T16:49:05	film_girl check out Breevy for windows...can use TE snippets
film_girl	717393589978972160	2016-04-05T16:48:55	People upset should hopefully know there are other text expander type apps out there. aText is $5 
film_girl	717393319492526081	2016-04-05T16:47:50	dimensionmedia johnvoorhees and students can afford $120 a year esp if they need it for school. Those who say otherwise have bigger issues
film_girl	717392839299227653	2016-04-05T16:45:56	dimensionmedia johnvoorhees like $120 a year for those two apps for a lot of people is the most affordable they’ve ever had PS
film_girl	717392773310078976	2016-04-05T16:45:40	dimensionmedia johnvoorhees  I mean the $10 a month Photoshop/Lightroom plan is really great
film_girl	717392643907579904	2016-04-05T16:45:09	rtmfd schwa oh, definitely.
film_girl	717392520045584384	2016-04-05T16:44:39	schwa oh, most definitely, but how do you charge for someone else’s syncing engine, I do get it tho
film_girl	717392427804463108	2016-04-05T16:44:17	jdevalk johnvoorhees yah I do think the team pricing is off. Esp. since individuals can do group sharing anyway
film_girl	717392365107994624	2016-04-05T16:44:03	This is my thought and why I’m happy to pay  
film_girl	717392312003923968	2016-04-05T16:43:50	I’m not super stoked about the broader trend to subscription software but at the same time, I want these apps/companies to exist
film_girl	717392248137187329	2016-04-05T16:43:35	dimensionmedia johnvoorhees and in fairness, that has worked out FANTASTICALLY for Adobe

film_girl	717391926832578560	2016-04-05T16:42:18	So this is TextExpander’s new pricing 
film_girl	717391523839623168	2016-04-05T16:40:42	I think I misread TextExpander’s documentation, the apps are “free” but to use it you do need an account

film_girl	717391034183991296	2016-04-05T16:38:45	Oh and it was johnvoorhees who wrote macstoriesnet’s great TextExpander write-up 
film_girl	717390825601118208	2016-04-05T16:37:55	This is how I feel. 
film_girl	717390771096326145	2016-04-05T16:37:42	NateBarham I get this but I think about the apps I absolutely rely on. 1Password, TextExpander — I’ll pay yearly for them no problem
film_girl	717390607136763904	2016-04-05T16:37:03	For me, having TextExpander on Windows is huge too, not b/c I use Windows very often, but b/c when I do I need my TE snippets
film_girl	717390273261789184	2016-04-05T16:35:44	That said, I do think dropping iCloud/Dropbox sync is going to anger a lot of people. The solution, of course is just keep using version 5
film_girl	717390186175467520	2016-04-05T16:35:23	But if I’m honest, I still want to support an app/service so that it stays around. It that means I pay $50 a year for an app I love, OK
film_girl	717389257682395140	2016-04-05T16:31:42	mikeysmith not sure, still playing with it. I don’t think so so if that’s the case maybe stick with version 5

film_girl	717384739636772864	2016-04-05T16:13:44	johnkestner my fear though is with shit like the Samsung Fridge that looks amazing but that you know won’t work in 2 years, let alone 10
film_girl	717384657063571457	2016-04-05T16:13:25	johnkestner have real, broader conversations
film_girl	717384633848037376	2016-04-05T16:13:19	johnkestner Sadly, I think that’s the case. It will take some sort of huge outage or dropping support for a well-used product for us to
film_girl	717384173267378177	2016-04-05T16:11:29	sbono14 I just don’t see how this is a bad thing.
film_girl	717383682999394305	2016-04-05T16:09:33	johnkestner I *hope* I wasn’t too easy on Nest/Revolv but I wanted to temper my outrage b/c thetruth is it did take month for anyone tocare
film_girl	717383283416428544	2016-04-05T16:07:57	johnkestner agreed completely

film_girl	717381224474533888	2016-04-05T15:59:46	sbono14 WhatsApp WIRED I mean, I think it proves that getting into the phone is often not that helpful if the data stored is encrypted
film_girl	717381085882089472	2016-04-05T15:59:13	johnkestner I totally agree. But at the same time, I’d rather less-savvy consumers know that going in than be surprised when shit goes awry

film_girl	717379436480438274	2016-04-05T15:52:40	johnkestner like this.
film_girl	717379397481725952	2016-04-05T15:52:31	johnkestner but realistically, consumers too need to know that buying a smart home product != buying a normal appliance, just b/c of shit
film_girl	717379303319724034	2016-04-05T15:52:08	johnkestner I agree we need to think about the bigger picture — and companies need to be upfront about their intentions
film_girl	717379204556439553	2016-04-05T15:51:45	johnkestner right. But like, let’s pretend Nest didn’t acquire Revolv — would any of these units be working now? I seriously doubt it
film_girl	717379009886040064	2016-04-05T15:50:58	johnkestner I understand why they didn’t do that. I’m not saying it’s right, but it is what it is.
film_girl	717378945805451265	2016-04-05T15:50:43	johnkestner I mean, I think the RIGHT thing to do is to make the server open source and update firmware so it can be used sans server BUT

film_girl	717081709087485952	2016-04-04T20:09:36	Brobuntu beejoli like, season 2 got a little off the rails and season 3 was a train wreck (that ending tho) but peak OC was believable
film_girl	717081569782063104	2016-04-04T20:09:03	Brobuntu beejoli that’s what made the show so good, esp season 1/4 — you still BOUGHT the drama as ridic as it was
film_girl	717080444810997761	2016-04-04T20:04:35	beejoli I mean, suburban Atlanta wasn’t The OC, but like the kids thought they were that rich (they weren’t, which made me laugh)
film_girl	717079180480028672	2016-04-04T19:59:33	beejoli but I loved it unabashedly
film_girl	717079149714808832	2016-04-04T19:59:26	beejoli this is very true. I lived in LA in ’05/’06 and would have to go to Orange County sometimes but I still don’t really “get” it
film_girl	717078942998376448	2016-04-04T19:58:37	If you didn't live south of the 605/405 intersect &amp; turn 16 between '03 and '05, you don't ~really~ get The O.C. (but you should still try)
film_girl	717078950284042240	2016-04-04T19:58:39	beejoli Brobuntu also the number of times Luke totally changed characters in his brief 1 season appearance. But my God do I love that show
film_girl	717078837461389313	2016-04-04T19:58:12	beejoli Brobuntu for me it was more the idea that Theresa would be engaged/able to take a semester off at 16
film_girl	717078398615556098	2016-04-04T19:56:27	Brobuntu beejoli but seriously, look up that Orange County gang rape case where all those kids got off
film_girl	717078121418244096	2016-04-04T19:55:21	Brobuntu beejoli ORANGE COUNTY

film_girl	715920108263251968	2016-04-01T15:13:49	mcelhearn he did. But this is UMG’s choice, not his. He has no say in this
film_girl	715920067356147716	2016-04-01T15:13:39	ShaneHudson he did. It’s not his choice. It’s his labels choice

film_girl	715615002472878081	2016-03-31T19:01:26	jf or rather, they sold LGPL exceptions. Anyway, big projects didn’t pay and used old versions and it was not used
film_girl	715614694388723713	2016-03-31T19:00:13	jf haha! that was sort of the old license tho, it was GPLv2/commercial and the problem was big projects didn’t pay

film_girl	715591730217816064	2016-03-31T17:28:58	danielpunkass no I totally hear you. Like I said, we’ve literally never connected our line and we bought our own modem so
film_girl	715591622126342145	2016-03-31T17:28:32	danielpunkass ahh — see, I wasn’t even aware that was an option
film_girl	715591096781422592	2016-03-31T17:26:27	danielpunkass plus since these are VoIP lines the whole “power goes out” argument is like, actually, naw
film_girl	715591025088135168	2016-03-31T17:26:10	danielpunkass right, and I guess I can see that. THat’s not something grobertson and I have to worry about

film_girl	715559147777966082	2016-03-31T15:19:29	KhyleDeen pkafka I mean, the first version was briefly available to download so all the torrent sites already got it
film_girl	715558199831605248	2016-03-31T15:15:43	toddheberlein I have no idea. It was probably a local merchant. Regardless they shut-off my card which meant shutting off it from Apple Pay

film_girl	715554017200500737	2016-03-31T14:59:06	Last: kanyewest would like some money. Releasing the album broadly allows him to get some from UMG.
film_girl	715553708650668032	2016-03-31T14:57:53	And! The fact that kanyewest kept tinkering with TLOP allowed both of them to claim that the album had never been formally "released"
film_girl	715553513187749888	2016-03-31T14:57:06	But! kanyewest is kanyewest, so his label, Universal Music, wasn't willing to fight him directly.
film_girl	715553348167069696	2016-03-31T14:56:27	Biz stuff: kanyewest never had the formal ability to keep his album locked up on Tidal to begin with.
film_girl	715553102393425921	2016-03-31T14:55:28	It's kanyewest, so you never know. But looks like TLOP is coming to Spotify, Apple Music tomorrow.

film_girl	715391682338906112	2016-03-31T04:14:03	They are “expressing” me a new card but like, FML. I don’t have time for this
film_girl	715391631986286594	2016-03-31T04:13:51	And apparently some merchant I used was hacked so my card was shut down. And Apple Pay turned off. Thanks Bank

film_girl	714585755893366786	2016-03-28T22:51:35	mobile_reach and the government may not have to provide them with any info unless they use data obtained in a criminal case

film_girl	710565642366230529	2016-03-17T20:37:05	asktimothybuck I think a substantial portion of Tweetdeck users are Mac users at work

film_girl	710564319575064576	2016-03-17T20:31:50	asktimothybuck that's what I have to think. I have to think it was just like NOTHING. Everyone just uses it in Chrome on Windows
film_girl	710563195182837760	2016-03-17T20:27:22	projct matthewmspace yup. The integrated nature/ annual upgrade cycle make it imperfect for gaming
film_girl	710562966849118210	2016-03-17T20:26:27	Maybe it’ll just bomb hard like Atlas Shrugged

film_girl	710562478007128068	2016-03-17T20:24:31	Fair. But Mac &gt; Windows on the app front so you know 
film_girl	710562409921056769	2016-03-17T20:24:14	stevescipioni it’s developers but I also think it’s that power users are often Mac users
film_girl	710562349653090304	2016-03-17T20:24:00	stevescipioni and media Twitter is almost all Mac too
film_girl	710562306963468288	2016-03-17T20:23:50	OK, well we all knew Mac gaming would NEVER win. But yes  
film_girl	710562071432318976	2016-03-17T20:22:54	Like a big part of me still feels like it’s 2003 and Mac software still gets the short end of the stick. But like no.
film_girl	710561970022383617	2016-03-17T20:22:29	Weird world when Twitter has two Mac apps but no Windows app. Like I know it’s not that weird but still.

film_girl	710130684929687552	2016-03-16T15:48:43	AceDeceiver used a simple remote switch to evade App Store detection. 
film_girl	710128955643314176	2016-03-16T15:41:51	This is why Apple believes a backdoor is too dangerous to even create: They couldn't control it. 
film_girl	710128565044584448	2016-03-16T15:40:18	Not only does AceDeceiver break its leash, but it uses a deeply embedded DRM design flaw to do it, making it difficult to fix quickly.
film_girl	710127361367343105	2016-03-16T15:35:31	AceDeceiver is a great example of how a cryptographic “leash” can be broken by criminals.
film_girl	710126930570436608	2016-03-16T15:33:48	Sure, Apple can handle managing a backdoor. They’ve never fallen victim to hackers.

film_girl	708396595184836608	2016-03-11T20:58:04	Whereas Spotify will let you make a playlist public and then let others find it. Which is awesome

film_girl	704782554054971392	2016-03-01T21:37:09	Vance: there may be overlap. I do believe what we should be seeking collectively is not a phone by phone solution but creating a framework
film_girl	704782475856322560	2016-03-01T21:36:51	Nadler: Vance, Comey suggested the relief is limited to this one device, I gather you don’t really think this is limited? ApplevsFBI
