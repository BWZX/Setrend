gabyhinsliff	726064378030751745	2016-04-29T15:03:32	jpjanson you nearly always are confused

gabyhinsliff	725976246530744320	2016-04-29T09:13:19	hannahbeckerman guardian no. As you might hope would be clear from me saying she had to be suspended. That hopes for shah were so high...

gabyhinsliff	725969977807917056	2016-04-29T08:48:25	AlexClark3 I think majority of labour members very much can see &amp; understand that, and are immensely frustrated by the few who can't

gabyhinsliff	725815781250994176	2016-04-28T22:35:41	billymac1964 oh ffs.labour is not antisemitic. Labour contains some people who express antisemitic remarks and many who don't. Weirdly...
gabyhinsliff	725815388920025088	2016-04-28T22:34:08	japglish RJSHutton when a Tory Mp is suspended for antisemitism remarks &amp; a Tory ex-mayor drags in hitler, I'll cover it. Goodbye.
gabyhinsliff	725814817215258625	2016-04-28T22:31:52	billymac1964 the tories have had a Jewish &amp; a female leader. I missed the bit where this proves them to be right-on feminists for all time
gabyhinsliff	725814329279414272	2016-04-28T22:29:55	SuperJules84 I hope she will learn from this and come back a better politician. (Always the optimist)
gabyhinsliff	725814189072257024	2016-04-28T22:29:22	japglish RJSHutton shame you missed last week's column on racism in the Tory party. I think we've taken this as far as it can go now
gabyhinsliff	725813787106902016	2016-04-28T22:27:46	bokkiedog DAaronovitch it's not the guardian. These people will go onto any free access sites to comment. Many guardian readers hate it
gabyhinsliff	725813505128030208	2016-04-28T22:26:39	bokkiedog DAaronovitch no, I never do that
gabyhinsliff	725813174734323712	2016-04-28T22:25:20	voxvot DAaronovitch I took it that robertshrimsley was arguing he couldn't vote for the party best reflecting his &amp; his city's interests
gabyhinsliff	725812735582281729	2016-04-28T22:23:35	japglish RJSHutton predictably, I am against antisemitism. I'm pretty comfortable with people being able to predict that about me.
gabyhinsliff	725812474675646464	2016-04-28T22:22:33	japglish RJSHutton i think, as I said, there's antisemitism in all parties. Are you really saying labour is immune?
gabyhinsliff	725812191019044864	2016-04-28T22:21:25	Or if people thought for two minutes about how it looks to voters, when anything their party gets wrong has to be someone else's fault
gabyhinsliff	725811089435414528	2016-04-28T22:17:03	If half the energy devoted to conspiracy theories about why this antisemitism row is got up by the media, went into tackling antisemitism.

gabyhinsliff	725810157792419844	2016-04-28T22:13:21	japglish RJSHutton so I made it all up?
gabyhinsliff	725809979844874242	2016-04-28T22:12:38	davesmith_109 Misanthropicguy so me and the NYT are in it together, are we? Who is organising us, out of interest?
gabyhinsliff	725809002282663937	2016-04-28T22:08:45	japglish RJSHutton so I persuaded Ken to say something mad, in order to attack Corbyn by cunningly not attacking him? Wow, I'm good.
gabyhinsliff	725808220908978177	2016-04-28T22:05:39	davesmith_109 billymac1964 his remarks today are inevitably taken in the context of everything else he's said.
gabyhinsliff	725807543604396032	2016-04-28T22:02:57	PenalltaRat exactly - so many people manage perfectly well being pro-Palestinian but not anti-Jew. It's a difficult as you want to make it
gabyhinsliff	725806661873586182	2016-04-28T21:59:27	tim_brannigan in fairness, I did do Tory racism last week. There seems to be a lot of it around.
gabyhinsliff	725803676787466242	2016-04-28T21:47:35	davesmith_109 billymac1964 &amp; mine deliberately didn't do that. Ken made his remarks today. How is that 'old news'?

gabyhinsliff	725796215611359233	2016-04-28T21:17:57	.RJSHutton ah, so you think it's a plot to undermine Corbyn and his leadership by NOT attacking him? Cunning. But tricky to pull off

gabyhinsliff	725794739178590209	2016-04-28T21:12:05	Two lessons from writing about Ken: 1. Corbynites on Twitter are more personally offensive than old school apologists for antisemitism
gabyhinsliff	725794483435085824	2016-04-28T21:11:04	RJSHutton presumably it would ruin a good conspiracy theory if one was to do so
gabyhinsliff	725794413327343616	2016-04-28T21:10:47	. RJSHutton precisely why I didn't criticise Corbyn for anything in the piece. Something not a single furious Corbynite has yet noticed

gabyhinsliff	712620322219024385	2016-03-23T12:41:39	Main lesson from PMQs is that every time a Lab MP asks an awkward Q for the next year, PM will read out where they were on 'hostile' list
gabyhinsliff	712619707866722304	2016-03-23T12:39:12	Interesting Q from @douglascarswellmp: if we vote to go, will EU respond vindictively? (PM basically suggested that it could) pmqs
gabyhinsliff	712617701076770816	2016-03-23T12:31:14	Drink For The Queen sounds a bit more appealing than cleaning for her pmqs
gabyhinsliff	712613664134729728	2016-03-23T12:15:11	This is clearly the most fun Tory MPs have had at PMQs for ages. Despite everything.

gabyhinsliff	712612748685877248	2016-03-23T12:11:33	Finally Corbyn gets around to raising IDS. But in a long, rambling question which makes it easier for PM to pick the bit he wants to answer
gabyhinsliff	712611746993872898	2016-03-23T12:07:34	Good opener from Corbyn, asking for an apology to disabled people for unnecessary uncertainty &amp; distress over PIP. (didn't get one, obvs)

gabyhinsliff	712189921130250240	2016-03-22T08:11:23	jillongovt guardiang2 then I think that might be quite an unusual reading, judging by my feed
gabyhinsliff	712060205186600962	2016-03-21T23:35:57	@politicsandpuns people can make themselves believe literally anything they want to believe

gabyhinsliff	712057685236183040	2016-03-21T23:25:56	jillongovt guardiang2 of course. But you've read the piece, right? Which is about singletons old and young, with and without kids. Etc

gabyhinsliff	712051463804030976	2016-03-21T23:01:12	backtoroubaix JuliaHB1 is that a different thing? You can tell I know nothing about graphs. Or charts.
