SI_PeterKing	726190659774779392	2016-04-29T23:25:19	Haven’t seen such joy about a pick in a long time. Good for Jaylon Smith. Really good. Great, great story.
SI_PeterKing	726158700818264064	2016-04-29T21:18:20	It isn’t true. 
SI_PeterKing	726149933036773376	2016-04-29T20:43:29	Good question. My guess is Cowboys thought there was 5-10% chance he’d get grabbed—a risk they didn’t want to take. 
SI_PeterKing	726149245787463680	2016-04-29T20:40:46	Leftover from round 1, as Edwerderespn said: Ravens weren’t trying to trade from 6 to 4 to get Elliott. It was Ramsey for Bal, absolutely.
SI_PeterKing	726125068028239872	2016-04-29T19:04:41	It was intentional. --- HAIR-cut (noun). 1 The act of getting your salary whacked. 2 Trimming unsightly hair. 
SI_PeterKing	726115196452769793	2016-04-29T18:25:28	Oh, it’s me. 
SI_PeterKing	726084072544464896	2016-04-29T16:21:47	The Dee Gordon story is amazing. Huge star, gone for half the season. What a blow to Marlins.
SI_PeterKing	726080880830083073	2016-04-29T16:09:06	Will pass that along. Was really proud of team theMMQB last night. Adjusted on the fly, did great stories/editing. 
SI_PeterKing	726078799444480000	2016-04-29T16:00:50	Hard work last night by MarkMravic, SI_mattgagne, GGramling_SI, dombonvissuto for the fast editing/posting of theMMQB draft stuff. Tnx!
SI_PeterKing	726063647491952640	2016-04-29T15:00:37	IMO, the price point for Osweiler was way out of whack. Kaepernick, we could discuss.  
SI_PeterKing	726063230368378880	2016-04-29T14:58:58	Osweiler: 4 yrs, $72m. Lynch (projected): 4 yrs, $9.1m. Kaepernick: $11.9m in 2016.
SI_PeterKing	726062593295572992	2016-04-29T14:56:26	He did not say. 
SI_PeterKing	726062255591161856	2016-04-29T14:55:05	Correct. Major paycut. 
SI_PeterKing	726062164490870784	2016-04-29T14:54:44	Thanks, Jeremy, and thanks to all for 32 minutes of great questions. 
SI_PeterKing	726061882411339776	2016-04-29T14:53:37	We had boots on ground in Chicago, LA (RobertKlemko), Cleveland (JennyVrentas), Balt (kalynkahler). Thanks, all. 
SI_PeterKing	726061660226490371	2016-04-29T14:52:44	Great reporting from Chicago, emilymkaplan! 
SI_PeterKing	726061121849823232	2016-04-29T14:50:35	Elway3: Said Den was “really close” to getting Kaepernick; Phil asked “way too much” for Bradford. “More than one solution to a problem."
SI_PeterKing	726060962227191808	2016-04-29T14:49:57	Elway2: "If you had said to me, ‘Here are your four options,’ and you named the four we just went through, this is the one we’d take.’’

SI_PeterKing	726049967656304640	2016-04-29T14:06:16	I’m answering all your NFL draft questions about that wild first round at The MMQB Facebook page. 
SI_PeterKing	726018248928436226	2016-04-29T12:00:13	Will be doing a Facebook Live chat on The MMQB page today at 10 a.m. ET. Tweet your draft questions now. I look forward to answering them.
SI_PeterKing	725955813458731008	2016-04-29T07:52:08	My first-round column is up.  
SI_PeterKing	725951216795033600	2016-04-29T07:33:52	Sorry. Little tied up tonight. 
SI_PeterKing	725951142836858882	2016-04-29T07:33:34	Will have a mini-MMQB up in a while, led by Elway/Lynch. Our emilymkaplan, live from Chicago, reports on the Tunsil tumble.
SI_PeterKing	725950316378624001	2016-04-29T07:30:17	Holy crap! Dee Gordon whacked for 80 games? What a story.
SI_PeterKing	725949946793316352	2016-04-29T07:28:49	Bingo. Great point, Peter. 
SI_PeterKing	725936986184273920	2016-04-29T06:37:19	Keanu Neal, 17. Myles Jack, not picked. One strange night.
SI_PeterKing	725936094248722433	2016-04-29T06:33:46	You could write my column tonight. 
SI_PeterKing	725936017732067329	2016-04-29T06:33:28	I thought that was a really fun 1st round. Some intrigue, some surprises (Jack, A’Shawn, Hannibal Lecter), and Denver getting Manning heir.
SI_PeterKing	725935338867191808	2016-04-29T06:30:46	I don’t know. My guesses: 1 Balt at 36 2 Ten at 43 3 No lower than Atl at 50. 
SI_PeterKing	725934288344993792	2016-04-29T06:26:36	Klis is smart. 
SI_PeterKing	725934168966762496	2016-04-29T06:26:07	I’m just sitting here writing my Friday column. What’d I do now? 
SI_PeterKing	725933859989127168	2016-04-29T06:24:54	Talked to Elway tonight. He did a terrific job managing a bad QB sitch. Didn’t get held hostage. Lynch (4 yrs, $9m) won’t hamstring team.
SI_PeterKing	725881489787744256	2016-04-29T02:56:48	Denver and Lynch?
SI_PeterKing	725881347256909824	2016-04-29T02:56:14	Getting into Paxton Lynch territory now.
SI_PeterKing	725844018932805632	2016-04-29T00:27:54	I smell a shocker here.
SI_PeterKing	725824570163228672	2016-04-28T23:10:37	Not to be sappy, but wanted to tell all @PFFers, led by PFF_Neil and CollinsworthPFF: Thanks for the great pre-draft education this year.
SI_PeterKing	725805357562384384	2016-04-28T21:54:16	Yeah. The nerve of the guy to die today, of all days. 
SI_PeterKing	725804666118791168	2016-04-28T21:51:31	RIP, Blackie Sherrod.  Legend of the fall. What a giant.

SI_PeterKing	725681583353532416	2016-04-28T13:42:26	Our RobertKlemko with a look at the QB-neediest teams entering the draft: 
SI_PeterKing	725681131471822848	2016-04-28T13:40:38	Good perspective, as always, from DonBanks: 
SI_PeterKing	725663413548912641	2016-04-28T12:30:14	It’s in this column, right after the draft niblets.  
SI_PeterKing	725661707381547009	2016-04-28T12:23:27	I meant: What he said. 
SI_PeterKing	725661185069064201	2016-04-28T12:21:23	I’m going to use it in my Monday column. 
SI_PeterKing	725660331112951809	2016-04-28T12:17:59	Agreed. Kind of emotional to see mortreport in the commercial.  
SI_PeterKing	725657321674706945	2016-04-28T12:06:02	Ten Things I’m Hearing on the draft, plus the debut of DearPeyton spot you’ll see tonight from Gatorade on TV: 
SI_PeterKing	725578838365888512	2016-04-28T06:54:10	Draft-day column is up.  
SI_PeterKing	725553889559207937	2016-04-28T05:15:02	Then whoever they take is wrong. Right? 
SI_PeterKing	725552883496706048	2016-04-28T05:11:02	And Yastrzemski. 
SI_PeterKing	725552754035294209	2016-04-28T05:10:31	Time will show that Ryan Kelly will be either the best at his position in this draft, or close to it. So good. 
SI_PeterKing	725552371258953728	2016-04-28T05:09:00	So if they take Ramsey or Tunsil, that’s going to make people vote for the stadium? Stop. Just stop. 
SI_PeterKing	725552081122168832	2016-04-28T05:07:50	Some teams can keep secrets well—and I do not know for sure Stanley is guy at 3. 
SI_PeterKing	725551739647062020	2016-04-28T05:06:29	Mystery team. Buckner or OT is my guess, but that’s all it is—a guess. 
SI_PeterKing	725551347894874112	2016-04-28T05:04:56	Because the media machine ordained Tunsil better, and if a smart GM goes against the grain he’s a dunce? 
SI_PeterKing	725550220952506368	2016-04-28T05:00:27	I don’t, really. 
SI_PeterKing	725549576275431424	2016-04-28T04:57:53	Nutty draft, but I think it starts: 1 Goff 2 Wentz 3 Stanley 4 Elliott Miami mourns. Jax tries to deal.
SI_PeterKing	725340617316904960	2016-04-27T15:07:34	Good stuff from Jenny on Draft Eve. 
SI_PeterKing	725330546243571720	2016-04-27T14:27:32	That is a better idea. Thanks for it. In MMQB it’ll go, unless it stages a rally and upsets 1. 
SI_PeterKing	725329927839571968	2016-04-27T14:25:05	Thanks Pat. I was split down the middle on what I thought was best for draft day. Why not ask what folks want? 
SI_PeterKing	725329443808530432	2016-04-27T14:23:10	Ten Things is crushing Wyche in the vote. Maybe I’ll tweet Bengal story when I get time later today. Thx for input!

SI_PeterKing	725327822244433920	2016-04-27T14:16:43	Writing a Draft Day column for the morning. How about if I give you 2 choices for the top, and you pick it, and that’s why I’ll do?
SI_PeterKing	725324905449926656	2016-04-27T14:05:08	Our emilymkaplan says the NFL will have lots of choices for where the draft goes in 2017 and beyond.

SI_PeterKing	725156144986099712	2016-04-27T02:54:32	And JennyVrentas looks on with disdain. 
SI_PeterKing	725032563706843136	2016-04-26T18:43:28	Outstanding interview by our JennyVrentas. So many great niblets.

SI_PeterKing	724731236451684352	2016-04-25T22:46:06	On the Brady ruling: AndrewBrandt and I write dueling takes. 
SI_PeterKing	724724786899877888	2016-04-25T22:20:28	I infer from this Tweet that you disapprove of me. Is that correct? 
SI_PeterKing	724724563943260162	2016-04-25T22:19:35	You are charitable, and a gentleman. Thank you. I like Steel Rail. 
SI_PeterKing	724723001992839170	2016-04-25T22:13:23	Good evening! My mock draft is here. It probably will stink to high heaven.  via

SI_PeterKing	724699258893553665	2016-04-25T20:39:02	I’m live with JennyVrentas &amp; GGramling_SI. Talking all things NFL draft: 
SI_PeterKing	724671189474512898	2016-04-25T18:47:29	Two views of the Brady ruling, from me and AndrewBrandt: 
SI_PeterKing	724620942626959361	2016-04-25T15:27:50	"Mr. Roseman ... A John Elway for you. Line 2." 
SI_PeterKing	724616960147894272	2016-04-25T15:12:00	Doubt Denver, but I don’t know where Foles will go. 
SI_PeterKing	724616215948328964	2016-04-25T15:09:03	Rams could get a 2016 pick for Foles. 
SI_PeterKing	724616017150881793	2016-04-25T15:08:15	So why limit them? If Tunsil/Stanley top guy on board when they pick at 8, take him. 
SI_PeterKing	724615340341211137	2016-04-25T15:05:34	Yeah. They’ve done so well picking other positions in the 1st round. One OL in top 10 of last 10 drafts: Joe Thomas. 
SI_PeterKing	724611310927904770	2016-04-25T14:49:33	Top 10 of each draft, I said. 
SI_PeterKing	724575042168827906	2016-04-25T12:25:26	I really do not see it happening. Maybe in the third round. Not in the first. 
SI_PeterKing	724574462536986624	2016-04-25T12:23:08	I think moving to Cleveland at 8 would be fine for Robinson, who’d love Tunsil or Stanley. 
SI_PeterKing	724574440726491136	2016-04-25T12:23:03	Mock Draft bargains: Floyd, Conklin, Treadwell. Lynch’s landing spot foggy. 
SI_PeterKing	724568379886067712	2016-04-25T11:58:58	My mock draft is up. Inside MMQB. Commence potshots. Trades: Jax, Tenn, Cle, Sea. 
SI_PeterKing	724459230519017472	2016-04-25T04:45:15	My Monday column is up.

SI_PeterKing	724390104756805632	2016-04-25T00:10:34	You’re right. That was a great story too. 60 Minutes so important. 
SI_PeterKing	724389705572356097	2016-04-25T00:08:58	Pelley with inspiring tale of parents of soldiers who died helping others who died more recently. Two incredible stories.

SI_PeterKing	724370637532323840	2016-04-24T22:53:12	Okay.  
SI_PeterKing	724370031249907713	2016-04-24T22:50:48	Okay. 
SI_PeterKing	724359570483744768	2016-04-24T22:09:14	The Myles Jack question is big, as AlbertBreer says. Some teams think he’ll need always-risky microfracture surgery at some point.
SI_PeterKing	724356771876319232	2016-04-24T21:58:06	A little Prince. A lot of draft. Mock Draft. Cle-Phl trade. Concussion suit. Josh Norman. Prince haiku.  
SI_PeterKing	724339086585135104	2016-04-24T20:47:50	I don’t really know what this means.

SI_PeterKing	724337602359341064	2016-04-24T20:41:56	Always is. Last year I got 27 of 32 wrong in the mock. 
SI_PeterKing	724336556941647872	2016-04-24T20:37:47	Please no more draft information. Please. Enough shuffling of the pieces. I know it’s wrong. I just can’t look at it anymore.
SI_PeterKing	724336352276414466	2016-04-24T20:36:58	Finished MMQB. 4:37 pm ET. The Mock Draft Edition. Should be live in the wee hours.
SI_PeterKing	723947740502339585	2016-04-23T18:52:46	Really good idea, so well done, by DonBanks: . What a difference 45 years makes.

SI_PeterKing	723860073064345600	2016-04-23T13:04:24	It's a tie. 
SI_PeterKing	723841332905709568	2016-04-23T11:49:56	I do believe JimTrotter_NFL has the cutest dog in the history of dogdom. 
SI_PeterKing	723716552101629952	2016-04-23T03:34:06	When do you make exceptions? When it’s emotionally correct? Or when you just feel it’s right? 
SI_PeterKing	723716040904048641	2016-04-23T03:32:04	I would judge players on what they did as players only. 
SI_PeterKing	723715638762590209	2016-04-23T03:30:28	Please do. 
SI_PeterKing	723715418502868992	2016-04-23T03:29:36	That is not what we are asked to do. We are asked to judge players on what they do as players.  
SI_PeterKing	723715078667771904	2016-04-23T03:28:15	One of great Twitterisms. Never said Sharper should be in the Hall. Just said he should be judged on football only. 
SI_PeterKing	723714371885604868	2016-04-23T03:25:26	You’re right. The NFL would hate Pat Tillman being in the Hall of Fame. 
SI_PeterKing	723713822805073920	2016-04-23T03:23:15	My feelings about this, as a voter for the Hall, is players should be judged for football only. Nothing else.
SI_PeterKing	723711666253365248	2016-04-23T03:14:41	Football players should be judged for the Hall of Fame based on their football credentials. Nothing else.
SI_PeterKing	723711428159504384	2016-04-23T03:13:45	IMO: Silly to confuse patriotism with athletic greatness. Some will disagree with me. That’s fine. It’s a free country.
SI_PeterKing	723709413362679809	2016-04-23T03:05:44	Not mine. 
SI_PeterKing	723697558091083776	2016-04-23T02:18:38	Not tonight. 
SI_PeterKing	723696975233855488	2016-04-23T02:16:19	There aren’t many shooters east of Curry like Kyle Korver. He is something else.
SI_PeterKing	723690489984221189	2016-04-23T01:50:32	Great signing by Scot McCloughan. Huge add in a strong QB division. 
SI_PeterKing	723529427385221121	2016-04-22T15:10:32	These are incredibly educational, thanks to andy_benoit's great football knowledge and making guys at ease. 
SI_PeterKing	723328058078433280	2016-04-22T01:50:22	Had a fun conversation with kirkmin for his pod. Who knew? 
SI_PeterKing	723327537917616128	2016-04-22T01:48:18	Good night, Prince. What a life. 
SI_PeterKing	723268202613116932	2016-04-21T21:52:31	Wolverine: TimRohan. Wildcat: kalynkahler. Scarlet Knight: GregABedard. 
SI_PeterKing	723267767395299331	2016-04-21T21:50:48	And a Wildcat. And, yes, A Scarlet Knight came to SI via TheMMQB.
SI_PeterKing	723266648682168322	2016-04-21T21:46:21	Re AlbertBreer: A MAC man (Ohio U) now has hired two Nittany Lions, a Terp, a Buckeye, a Wolverine theMMQB. Can you guess them all?
SI_PeterKing	723264480755462144	2016-04-21T21:37:44	Very pleased to add multi-talented AlbertBreer to theMMQB this spring. He’ll help us writing, on video and in social media. We’re excited.
SI_PeterKing	723238891528933376	2016-04-21T19:56:03	Klemkomock. RobertKlemko’s forecast, a week out. 
SI_PeterKing	723236224052416513	2016-04-21T19:45:27	The story of the best kicker in draft in years is not just a story of a kicker. Great backstory, by JennyVrentas. 
SI_PeterKing	723227449421647872	2016-04-21T19:10:35	New mock draft from RobertKlemko includes another Top 10 trade involving the Browns.  
SI_PeterKing	722908117508296705	2016-04-20T22:01:40	This was a fun one. Respect that Robinson did right thing when he didn’t have to at end, giving up a conditional 7. 
SI_PeterKing	722907003220144129	2016-04-20T21:57:15	No. Yes. 
SI_PeterKing	722906865588314112	2016-04-20T21:56:42	No idea. Maybe Deshaun Watson or Chad Kelly. But I really don’t know. 
SI_PeterKing	722906229731827712	2016-04-20T21:54:10	Excellent insight, Jeff. And a great point. 
SI_PeterKing	722906006930391040	2016-04-20T21:53:17	Great comparison, Jonathan. Except BB right have said, ‘Let’s get one year out of him at $14m, then take Comp Pick.' 
SI_PeterKing	722905644517302272	2016-04-20T21:51:51	Like it for Cleveland. Because even if RG3 stinks, they’ll be in fine position to take the best QB in 2017 draft. 
SI_PeterKing	722902078578819072	2016-04-20T21:37:41	Good point. I would also say Elway and Gettleman just don’t carer what their peers or stars (Manning, Norman) think. 
SI_PeterKing	722901220478717952	2016-04-20T21:34:16	Paging Dave Caldwell. Jags would be a good match, with plenty to spend, for Josh Norman.
SI_PeterKing	722900995391401985	2016-04-20T21:33:22	Dave Gettleman is not to be messed with.
SI_PeterKing	722855237703376897	2016-04-20T18:31:33	That seems … shall we say, unlikely. 
SI_PeterKing	722854799629279232	2016-04-20T18:29:48	Kudos to alexmarvez for hinting strongly that Cle-Phil deal was taking shape last night. Smart guy, that Marvez.
SI_PeterKing	722814449778868224	2016-04-20T15:49:28	Ooops. LA, not StL. Bad muscle memory there.
SI_PeterKing	722812196850397184	2016-04-20T15:40:31	Titan-Ram2: … a conditional 7 to StL to get deal done. Could have said no. But it was just the right thing to do. Honor among GMs.
SI_PeterKing	722812148146171904	2016-04-20T15:40:19	Titan-Ram1: . One of my favorite parts of this story: Tenn GM Jon Robinson knew he really didn’t have to give …
SI_PeterKing	722746527911952385	2016-04-20T11:19:34	My Wednesday column is up. How one of the biggest trades in draft history really happened: 
SI_PeterKing	722662485761908737	2016-04-20T05:45:37	My Wednesday column is up.  
SI_PeterKing	722411870813097985	2016-04-19T13:09:46	Rich detail about a trip of a lifetime for Demaryius Thomas and Demarcus Ware, TheMMQB: 
SI_PeterKing	722411202681442305	2016-04-19T13:07:07	Here’s our Andy_Benoit, dropping some Reggie Ragland knowledge. A lot of it. 
SI_PeterKing	722383007361953793	2016-04-19T11:15:04	Congrats on an incredible career, Jim Vrentas. 
SI_PeterKing	722233982235058176	2016-04-19T01:22:54	Wow. Just wow. Congrats to the Baumans. 
SI_PeterKing	722228619423129600	2016-04-19T01:01:35	Voted for both. Proud to have done so. 
SI_PeterKing	722227872828694528	2016-04-19T00:58:37	I watched the game. They would have won 36-8 without him. 
SI_PeterKing	722227421882294276	2016-04-19T00:56:50	I did. Because that’s very possible as well. 
SI_PeterKing	722227278609051648	2016-04-19T00:56:16	Exactly my point. If everything goes right, any NFC East team could win 12. 
SI_PeterKing	722227167543828481	2016-04-19T00:55:49	Define “huge.” One “huge" play in the game—a KO return for TD when Seattle was up 22-0. 
SI_PeterKing	722226148839727104	2016-04-19T00:51:46	I said: If Eagles draft well, if they protect Bradford, if he’s what he was drafted to be, they could win 12. Could. 
SI_PeterKing	722224956378112001	2016-04-19T00:47:02	Yes. Yes. Without any question whatsoever. 
SI_PeterKing	722127749046001665	2016-04-18T18:20:46	I will be doing a Facebook live video chat today at The MMQB Facebook page at 3 p.m ET. Reply with your questions. Have a good day.
SI_PeterKing	722091823297142785	2016-04-18T15:58:01	Yes. You read me so well. Jack’s going to be the best LB of all time, obviously. 
SI_PeterKing	722091090300416000	2016-04-18T15:55:06	D.Brees: at least 4,300 yards in last 10 yrs. T.Bradshaw never threw for 3,800 yards in a season. Times change. 
SI_PeterKing	722089083812638720	2016-04-18T15:47:08	Varying feeling on Jack. Remember: 14 teams failed Anthony Munoz on his pre-draft physical. Might be best LT ever. 
SI_PeterKing	722038237577916416	2016-04-18T12:25:05	“I’m not one of those guys mad at the world because I’m getting my head hit.I play football.That’s the way it goes.” 
SI_PeterKing	722036553015521280	2016-04-18T12:18:23	Interesting question prompted by RichCimini: If you’re Cleve, do you go from 2 to 20 for Wilkerson+lesser pick(s)? 
SI_PeterKing	722035364429504514	2016-04-18T12:13:40	Jalen Ramsey had 2 INTs in last 40 FSU games … Phil, Dall, Jets, Den up to #2? … Draft chart is OK w/deal for Rams. 
SI_PeterKing	722029797401079808	2016-04-18T11:51:33	Good morning. MMQB is up. Heavy on JJWatt rebounding from painful groin injury.

SI_PeterKing	721888095738667009	2016-04-18T02:28:28	Ken Burns on Jackie Robinson on PBS is some fantastic television.
SI_PeterKing	721827638604640256	2016-04-17T22:28:14	And I love Minnesota! Looking forward to seeing your stadium. 
SI_PeterKing	721826367118159873	2016-04-17T22:23:11	Other than 3 Defensive Player of the Year awards in 5 NFL seasons.

SI_PeterKing	721819634131935232	2016-04-17T21:56:26	For MMQB, a trip to JJWatt’s place in Wisconsin, 12 weeks after major groin surgery: "I am very, very close to being back to 100 percent.''

SI_PeterKing	721414788933402624	2016-04-16T19:07:43	Confirming that Cowboys worked out Jared Goff in Berkeley this morning. Jerry Jones+Jason Garrett there. Jones reportedly loved what he saw.

SI_PeterKing	721050401961848832	2016-04-15T18:59:46	Our RobertKlemko went to New Orleans to report on Will Smith’s murder. He wrote a heck of a story: 
SI_PeterKing	720935086787584000	2016-04-15T11:21:33	My annual story of how the sausage (the 2016 NFL schedule) got made, from the men who made it:

SI_PeterKing	720832961789034497	2016-04-15T04:35:45	Look at history of RG3 trade. Rams got a jillion picks. But who left on Rams is a star? Ogletree? Brokers? Maybe 1. 
SI_PeterKing	720831783319638017	2016-04-15T04:31:04	Rams might have made a dumb deal. But how can you know till 2019?

SI_PeterKing	720783184661712901	2016-04-15T01:17:57	Way to go, Giants. 
SI_PeterKing	720729692387586054	2016-04-14T21:45:23	That’s a good job, viccarucci! 
SI_PeterKing	720658134927323136	2016-04-14T17:01:03	SI_PeterKing talks Titans-Rams. TEN got 6 prime pieces to rebuild team lacking in talent.  
SI_PeterKing	720627415446327298	2016-04-14T14:58:59	My analysis of one of the biggest trades in draft history. 
SI_PeterKing	720621552685969409	2016-04-14T14:35:41	I remember at the Combine talking to Jon Robinson about the odds he faced in dealing the top pick for value. He did a heck of a job here.
SI_PeterKing	720619862536691712	2016-04-14T14:28:58	I don’t know who they’re taking. 
SI_PeterKing	720619689903316993	2016-04-14T14:28:17	Kroenke did not make this trade. That I can promise you. 
SI_PeterKing	720619552191721472	2016-04-14T14:27:44	No gimme the Browns are picking a quarterback at 2.
SI_PeterKing	720619278706286592	2016-04-14T14:26:39	No. They’d have made this deal if they’d moved to Kankakee instead of LA. 
SI_PeterKing	720619043603013632	2016-04-14T14:25:43	Superb point, Greg. 
SI_PeterKing	720616972652830721	2016-04-14T14:17:29	I think if he had the ammo to go get a quarterback, and really liked one, he’d do what Les Snead just did. 
SI_PeterKing	720616135713021952	2016-04-14T14:14:09	Easy to ask that question when Tom Brady’s the quarterback. Rams didn’t have that luxury. 
SI_PeterKing	720615868338728960	2016-04-14T14:13:06	I said the Rams “have not decided with certainty” who they’re picking. Obviously they’ve got an idea. 
SI_PeterKing	720615073551618048	2016-04-14T14:09:56	Just filed a story on the trade theMMQB. Will link when it’s live. Rams have not decided with certainty who they will pick at number one.
SI_PeterKing	720598262177259521	2016-04-14T13:03:08	Titans had a great chance to rebuild roster. Felt they had to take it.
SI_PeterKing	720597909599875072	2016-04-14T13:01:44	Rams are on the clock.
SI_PeterKing	720597813327970304	2016-04-14T13:01:21	Titans have traded the top pick in the draft to the Rams.
SI_PeterKing	720440246903693313	2016-04-14T02:35:14	Fantastic tribute by the Lakers. The Jack Nicholson thing … priceless.
SI_PeterKing	720435142666428416	2016-04-14T02:14:57	What’s football?  
SI_PeterKing	720434694794452992	2016-04-14T02:13:10	How do you not respect what Kobe Bryant’s done? Good luck to him. Hope he scores 64 tonight.

SI_PeterKing	719695258536308738	2016-04-12T01:14:55	Why bother? Because Will Smith got rear-ended, got pissed off, then got murdered. That’s why. 
SI_PeterKing	719694945947402241	2016-04-12T01:13:41	Thank you. Praise the Lord. 
SI_PeterKing	719694605206319105	2016-04-12T01:12:19	This is the problem. The minute you start discussing limits on guns, all of a sudden you’re the problem. 
SI_PeterKing	719694400159232001	2016-04-12T01:11:30	No. 
SI_PeterKing	719694267996745729	2016-04-12T01:10:59	Said SeanPayton: “If this opinion in Louisiana is super-unpopular, then so be it.” 
SI_PeterKing	719693865762971648	2016-04-12T01:09:23	Good for SeanPayton, saying to JarrettBell: “I hate guns … I’ve heard people argue that everybody needs a gun. That’s madness."

SI_PeterKing	719203027580764161	2016-04-10T16:38:58	Smart words. 
SI_PeterKing	719137116366761985	2016-04-10T12:17:04	A question asked far too often, and fruitlessly, in our country. 
SI_PeterKing	719136623548637186	2016-04-10T12:15:06	You are not alone, Tom. 
SI_PeterKing	719133803793551361	2016-04-10T12:03:54	A good man and player gone. Utterly senseless. RIP Will Smith. 
SI_PeterKing	718974170831433728	2016-04-10T01:29:34	Now that is a great question, Joe. 
SI_PeterKing	718873669372669952	2016-04-09T18:50:13	Per , Holt has played 7 positions (all but C and P) since start of 2014 season. 
SI_PeterKing	718819942263611392	2016-04-09T15:16:43	Now this is the way to announce a retirement. 
SI_PeterKing	718818651881738242	2016-04-09T15:11:36	Great story by benshpigel about a enduring great athlete. 
SI_PeterKing	718635344657326080	2016-04-09T03:03:12	Verducci is so good on TV.
SI_PeterKing	718634854305423360	2016-04-09T03:01:15	Rare guy who’s not about stats-at all. Plays 7 positions. No idea about the analytics. Just watch games. He’s huge. 
SI_PeterKing	718632857397235712	2016-04-09T02:53:19	What a player Brock Holt is.
SI_PeterKing	718414087340834816	2016-04-08T12:24:00	Excellent analysis of Christian Hackenberg’s pro prospects by theMMQB’s JennyVrentas. 
SI_PeterKing	718115380938481665	2016-04-07T16:37:03	In search of Christian Hackenberg, by JennyVrentas. Well worth your time. 
SI_PeterKing	718107474973368320	2016-04-07T16:05:38	Our RobertKlemko tells you why you’d better study up on Keivarae1 leading up to draft day. Good info here. 
SI_PeterKing	718106649316225024	2016-04-07T16:02:21	Really good piece from theMMQB’s AndrewBrandt on how great the late Eugene Parker was. 
SI_PeterKing	717586194410778625	2016-04-06T05:34:15	My Wednesday column is up.  
SI_PeterKing	717321262213804032	2016-04-05T12:01:30	CLEVELAND-Good to dine w/BostonGlobe crew alexspeier, Dan_Shaughnessy, PeteAbe last nite. So good at their jobs. 
SI_PeterKing	717320398942167040	2016-04-05T11:58:04	Very good you-are-there story by emilymkaplan about Gruden and his camp. 
SI_PeterKing	716961529090867202	2016-04-04T12:12:03	NFL use of nickel defense 2008: 43.4% of snaps 2015: 63.4% of snaps (Thanks, PFF_Neil) Jalen Ramsey’s value? High. 
SI_PeterKing	716958658723254272	2016-04-04T12:00:39	Thanks, Sam. We’ll try to do it right. People are going to enjoy his memoir excerpts. 
SI_PeterKing	716956822595305473	2016-04-04T11:53:21	I bet the Jaguars would have liked to find out for themselves. 
SI_PeterKing	716955606528172032	2016-04-04T11:48:31	“We will be able to accurately diagnose CTE during a person’s life, perhaps in the next five to 10 years.” In MMQB. 
SI_PeterKing	716915507564253184	2016-04-04T09:09:11	Good morning. MMQB is up. 
SI_PeterKing	716871438146273280	2016-04-04T06:14:04	My Monday column is live.  
SI_PeterKing	716674633571901440	2016-04-03T17:12:02	I like to think so. 
SI_PeterKing	716674515313500160	2016-04-03T17:11:34	That’s what I’m talking about. 
SI_PeterKing	716674049238282241	2016-04-03T17:09:43	I prefer no DH. Like the strategy of the pitcher hitting. Know that makes me a dinosaur, but it makes baseball fun. 
SI_PeterKing	716672622352855040	2016-04-03T17:04:02	We most decidedly are not. 
SI_PeterKing	716672553360736256	2016-04-03T17:03:46	In MMQB tomorrow. But I do like a certain Canadian team to play deep into October. 
SI_PeterKing	716671437277380608	2016-04-03T16:59:20	Today’s a good day for box score nerds like me.
SI_PeterKing	715955182606147584	2016-04-01T17:33:11	This is fantastic, Rand. Congratulations, and much admiration for how far you’ve come. 
SI_PeterKing	715916404965445632	2016-04-01T14:59:06	Excellent point, Eric. 
SI_PeterKing	715910454300770304	2016-04-01T14:35:27	Thanks, Neal Bledsoe and SI_mattgagne, for this revealing look at a cool quest. 
SI_PeterKing	715885894700556288	2016-04-01T12:57:52	Good Friday interview by Jenny Vrentas. Quite topical this week. 
SI_PeterKing	715837826030551044	2016-04-01T09:46:52	A giant in the business. RIP, Eugene. 
SI_PeterKing	715776158508441600	2016-04-01T05:41:49	Mike Shanahan talks with JennyVrentas about his NFL future, plus RG3, Washington and more.  
SI_PeterKing	715765214306766848	2016-04-01T04:58:20	Normally you’d think this was an April Fools’ Day story. It’s very real.  
SI_PeterKing	715660505688440835	2016-03-31T22:02:15	Swell lunch today with Paul and Linda Zimmerman in NJ today. Will have stuff on that, plus a Dr. Z announcement, in MMQB Monday.
SI_PeterKing	715660316114288641	2016-03-31T22:01:30	Disagree. Dumb that NFL insists on 9 wks 4 teams 2 sign own guys pre-FA. FAs should be able 2 speak 2 teams pre-FA.  
SI_PeterKing	715274420701495296	2016-03-30T20:28:05	Our RobertKlemko with the bizarro relocation story and far-flung world of the Rams over the next couple of years. 
SI_PeterKing	715259695502589952	2016-03-30T19:29:34	In every job, we have decisions of conscience to make. I always try to make them honestly. All I can do. 
SI_PeterKing	715257641891729408	2016-03-30T19:21:25	I truly doubt it. What’s wrong with my Haiku, Matt? I think it’s groovy. 
SI_PeterKing	715257099899576321	2016-03-30T19:19:16	I doubt it. Odds are he stays in SF. But that can change. Kelly wants to work with him starting Monday. 
SI_PeterKing	715256884517842944	2016-03-30T19:18:24	Happy to address that anytime. It’s a fine line I try to balance. Some may feel—you, apparently—that I do it poorly. 
SI_PeterKing	715256148656566274	2016-03-30T19:15:29	I should be held accountable for my opinions, and readers should criticize them often. It’s part of the deal. 
SI_PeterKing	715254234531381248	2016-03-30T19:07:52	The MMQB would have lived, and flourished. 
SI_PeterKing	715181250080858112	2016-03-30T14:17:52	A groovy staff roundtable theMMQB. Opinions fly w/me, JennyVrentas, emilymkaplan, Andy_Benoit. 
SI_PeterKing	715172386186924032	2016-03-30T13:42:38	This richarddeitsch guy is one worker bee. High-quality bee. 
SI_PeterKing	715143696031854592	2016-03-30T11:48:38	My Wednesday mailbag is up, with the GM who has a history of trading--and who needs a QB badly. 
SI_PeterKing	714949465275240450	2016-03-29T22:56:50	Highlights: if-Pujols, Cano, Seager, Machado, McCann of-Betts, Braun, JBJ p-Price, McHugh, CMart, McCuller, Kazmir. 
SI_PeterKing	714854481171718144	2016-03-29T16:39:24	Sincere condolences, AaronWilson_NFL, on the loss of your wife Samantha. Feel awful for your family.
SI_PeterKing	714788258253770757	2016-03-29T12:16:15	My column on the Texans' signing of Brock Osweiler. 
SI_PeterKing	714564736105496577	2016-03-28T21:28:03	Just had one of those installed in my office, Tom. 
SI_PeterKing	714563631158059008	2016-03-28T21:23:40	I wish. Rotisserie baseball draft in Jersey tonight. 
SI_PeterKing	714557455116554240	2016-03-28T20:59:07	It will be theMMQB in the morning. 
SI_PeterKing	714523488900538369	2016-03-28T18:44:09	Great hire. Congrats, bykevinclark. 
SI_PeterKing	714428446777155586	2016-03-28T12:26:29	Good morning. MMQB is up: 
SI_PeterKing	714312320063635457	2016-03-28T04:45:03	My Monday column is live.  
SI_PeterKing	714222780133339136	2016-03-27T22:49:15	Dear Judy: In order:  1 White chocolate bunny 2 Milk chocolate bunny - Peeps stink, folks. Like chewing sugary air. 
SI_PeterKing	714217990967967746	2016-03-27T22:30:13	Darn it. Don’t bring that up! First prediction I ever got wrong! 
SI_PeterKing	714216951975948288	2016-03-27T22:26:05	You are crazy. Malted milk eggs. Undisputed Easter champion. 
SI_PeterKing	713877471213522948	2016-03-26T23:57:06	Sneak peak of Sunday's TheNewsPress sports front, almost all davidortiz. Story online now:  
SI_PeterKing	713449512618962944	2016-03-25T19:36:33	Our jennyvrentas talks to an NFL influencer you don’t know but should. Very apropos these days. 
SI_PeterKing	713042566590148609	2016-03-24T16:39:30	Thanks Chris. Being in a bus with John Madden for 4 days and nights turned into a really fun story. 
SI_PeterKing	713036767704793089	2016-03-24T16:16:27	SARASOTA, Fla.-Met Buck. Lots of admiration for him. Regaled me with Bear Bryant stories. Recruited by Bama. 
SI_PeterKing	712877292326883329	2016-03-24T05:42:45	In draft column, RobertKlemko has the coach perspective on top 3 QBs: Wentz, Goff, Lynch.  
SI_PeterKing	712725849808707584	2016-03-23T19:40:59	You’re welcome Jeff. It’s a very good life. 
SI_PeterKing	712725742270939137	2016-03-23T19:40:33	Have a good day all. Please send me any good fantasy baseball sleepers before my league draft Monday. I am clueless. (But you knew that.)
SI_PeterKing	712725110390722560	2016-03-23T19:38:02	RIP Joe Garagiola, the voice of Saturday afternoons of my youth.
SI_PeterKing	712724389700222976	2016-03-23T19:35:10	Just a hunch, but I think NE will spend big to sign top priorities Jamie Collins/Malcolm Butler. 
SI_PeterKing	712723730397532161	2016-03-23T19:32:33	I can only think of one Athens-related thing right now: Beat Morehead State! 
SI_PeterKing	712723563334262788	2016-03-23T19:31:53	I should hope so. First National Bank of Mara has been bled dry. 
SI_PeterKing	712723282068447234	2016-03-23T19:30:46	Really impressive guy. Smart enough to know he’ll be judged on whether he can develop Tannehill or another QB. 
SI_PeterKing	712722886432305152	2016-03-23T19:29:12	Sincerely doubt it. 
SI_PeterKing	712722774951923712	2016-03-23T19:28:45	I believe the kickoff won’t exist in 15 years, and perhaps much sooner. 
SI_PeterKing	712722595054006272	2016-03-23T19:28:03	I believe they are firmly behind Goodell, yes. 
SI_PeterKing	712722461687750656	2016-03-23T19:27:31	Laremy Tunsil. 
SI_PeterKing	712722342720442372	2016-03-23T19:27:02	Talked to one coach this morning who said, “My first thought is we’ll trying to pop up kicks to 5-." 
SI_PeterKing	712721946006331392	2016-03-23T19:25:28	Absolutely. It was a big worry last year, and now it’s worse without Okung. 
SI_PeterKing	712721828553170945	2016-03-23T19:25:00	I don’t know. I don’t believe the Denver quarterback is currently on the roster. 
SI_PeterKing	712721605105885184	2016-03-23T19:24:07	I believe we will. Likely it will be a shelter dog. We’ll see. 
SI_PeterKing	712721450373881856	2016-03-23T19:23:30	Call Frank Costanza. He knows all about infestations. 
SI_PeterKing	712721302835093505	2016-03-23T19:22:54	6.39% 
SI_PeterKing	712721218818977796	2016-03-23T19:22:34	Total flyer. Why not? Costs nothing. Ozzie loves the Tidemen. 
SI_PeterKing	712721074027413508	2016-03-23T19:22:00	Gut is Laremy Tunsil, but Jon Robinson would love option to trade out. Lewan more comfy at RT. 
SI_PeterKing	712720713770262530	2016-03-23T19:20:34	Aligorical: Had a good chat w/Mike Tomlin. Sometimes best thing in rabid market (Pit, Phil) is not being from there. 
SI_PeterKing	712720280389607425	2016-03-23T19:18:51	Trust me: Hue will have a backup plan, likely a fairly high pick in this draft, if Cleve taken on RG3. 
SI_PeterKing	712720130422226947	2016-03-23T19:18:15	Positive. Players like him, Winston really respects him, smart offensive plan. 
SI_PeterKing	712719851404599296	2016-03-23T19:17:08	BOCA RATON, Fla.- Twitter-Clogging Note of the Day: Time to play 15 questions. Got any?
SI_PeterKing	712663115595440128	2016-03-23T15:31:42	Yes, he was. 
SI_PeterKing	712639681133953024	2016-03-23T13:58:34	Wednesday mailbag is up, led by Rivera, Payton, Arians. And oh: Rams will be 2016 "Hard Knocks" team. 
SI_PeterKing	712603394159063040	2016-03-23T11:34:23	BOCA RATON, Fla.-Of course this is Bruce Arians' jacket at the NFC coaches breakfast. 
SI_PeterKing	712572430443798532	2016-03-23T09:31:21	Really good story, eric_adelson.  
SI_PeterKing	712459261121531908	2016-03-23T02:01:39	Steelers have annual meetings dinner at meetings for club brass, local and national scribes. So great to see Dan Rooney w/2 great scribes.
SI_PeterKing	712458581531033600	2016-03-23T01:58:57	BOCA RATON, Fla.-Three Pittsburgh legends--Vito Stellino, Dan Rooney, John Clayton--at annual Steeler dinner tonight 
SI_PeterKing	712402262803415042	2016-03-22T22:15:09	How long will Jerry Jones be running the Dallas Cowboys? 
SI_PeterKing	712387667808358400	2016-03-22T21:17:10	Peace be with you, Craig Sager. All the best from thousands, like me, who don’t know you but admire you. 
SI_PeterKing	712383469066661888	2016-03-22T21:00:29	Jerry Jones sounds like he still has a thing for Johnny Manziel.  
SI_PeterKing	712367001398685697	2016-03-22T19:55:02	Hey Dallas, have a question you wish you could ask your owner? Here’s three of them. 
SI_PeterKing	712344760418172928	2016-03-22T18:26:40	I asked Jerry Jones, 73, about his succession plan for running the Cowboys. Oh, and Manziel. .
SI_PeterKing	712303203019173889	2016-03-22T15:41:32	My column on John Harbaugh’s smart argument about adding safety plays, and a challenge, to the replay system: 
SI_PeterKing	712284485191081984	2016-03-22T14:27:09	.SI_PeterKing on Harbaugh's mission to sell Ravens’ expanded-replay plan. “Fans are officiating the game in replay."
SI_PeterKing	712275400378990592	2016-03-22T13:51:03	Superb story on Cleve WR Hawk, an Ivy League student one day a week who wants to be an NFL GM.  By our kalynkahler.
SI_PeterKing	712262315454963712	2016-03-22T12:59:03	BOCA RATON, FLA.-Ravens coach John Harbaugh on fire this morning. Passionate about increasing replay, defending football. I’m writing him.
SI_PeterKing	712236633140170752	2016-03-22T11:17:00	BOCA RATON, Fla..-Greetings from the annual AFC coaches breakfast. Story up later this morning theMMQB. 
SI_PeterKing	711910340481654787	2016-03-21T13:40:26	Just finished HarlanCoben’s new book, “Fool Me Once.’’ Whoa. That man knows how to make you turns pages, quickly. Really good read.
SI_PeterKing	711909124393594880	2016-03-21T13:35:36	Thank you. There is something amiss—though I hardly know baseball clubhouses—about taking a son to work every day.  
SI_PeterKing	711908308479811585	2016-03-21T13:32:22	A steal. Absolute steal. Great offensive weapon when healthy. 
SI_PeterKing	711908058428006400	2016-03-21T13:31:22	I suppose if they would be be willing to trade 2 ones, 2 twos and a three. Hard to imagine that. 
SI_PeterKing	711907814483095552	2016-03-21T13:30:24	Tom, if the Patriots want him, it’d surprise me if they don’t get him. See how that visit goes. 
SI_PeterKing	711907692072325121	2016-03-21T13:29:55	Too early to tell, but I doubt a quarterback. Bosa would be a smart pick, a need pick. 
SI_PeterKing	711907297807765506	2016-03-21T13:28:21	Thanks. It was a rough week in a lot of corners. 
SI_PeterKing	711907014536986625	2016-03-21T13:27:13	Absolutely, if he wants to be. It’s hard for a player who doesn’t care to play for Belichick. 
SI_PeterKing	711906876460507137	2016-03-21T13:26:40	Ruined by 4 p.m. on Thursday. 
SI_PeterKing	711906750992138240	2016-03-21T13:26:10	You have an 88.49% chance of having a valid jersey for 2016. 
SI_PeterKing	711906592602644480	2016-03-21T13:25:32	Likely a week or so before. 
SI_PeterKing	711906422913687552	2016-03-21T13:24:52	That is a silly way to look at it. 
SI_PeterKing	711906271675469825	2016-03-21T13:24:16	Cleveland’s the leader in the clubhouse. 
SI_PeterKing	711906199671840768	2016-03-21T13:23:59	First the Chargers have to either stay or go to LA. Most likely Raiders wait till that decision goes down. 
SI_PeterKing	711905727892361216	2016-03-21T13:22:06	I think he’ll play for either Niners or Broncos this year. Just my guess. 
SI_PeterKing	711905616755888128	2016-03-21T13:21:40	Defensive pass interference being a 15-yard penalty, not a spot foul. 
SI_PeterKing	711905483750297601	2016-03-21T13:21:08	Good morning Matt. Soon, I hope. Love that place and that park and that beer. 
SI_PeterKing	711905281077288960	2016-03-21T13:20:20	Thanks for reading the column and feeding back this morning. Ten minutes for questions, if you have a few.
SI_PeterKing	711900764248141825	2016-03-21T13:02:23	I am okay with the extra point not being a waste of everyone’s time and it being a somewhat competitive play. 
SI_PeterKing	711899857208942592	2016-03-21T12:58:47	The PAT from the 2 is a waste of time, a stupid exercise of uselessness. Took too long to fix it. 
SI_PeterKing	711899444380344320	2016-03-21T12:57:08	Thanks to DVNJr and JacobFeldman4 for including emilymkaplan’s story on Johnny Football in Sunday Longreads: 
SI_PeterKing	711896665943379968	2016-03-21T12:46:06	6 So this PAT rule that was so controversial a year ago should breeze through 31-1 or 32-0. What took the NFL so long to get smart about it?
SI_PeterKing	711896429946654720	2016-03-21T12:45:09	5 When NFL sent out rules surveys to GMs, coaches, teams, 70-some came back. Zero said the extra point should be moved back to 2-yd line.
SI_PeterKing	711896010075848704	2016-03-21T12:43:29	4 Whatever changes NFL would make to catch rule open up more problems—particularly w/simple possession for an instant w/2 feet on ground.
SI_PeterKing	711895618814349314	2016-03-21T12:41:56	3 As I wrote this morning …  … Beckham, despite 3 pers fouls v Carolina, wouldn’t have been tossed w/new rule.
SI_PeterKing	711895353478549505	2016-03-21T12:40:53	2 Unsportsmanlike/ejection is basically insurance for stupid behavior. But lots of pressure on refs in ’16 to eject in cases like Beckham’s.
SI_PeterKing	711894974527365120	2016-03-21T12:39:22	Notes from NFL meetings: 1 A reason for unsportsmanlike/ejection rule: NFL had 75 unsportsmanlike flags in ’15. Averaged 40 in 10 pre yrs.

SI_PeterKing	710459766032695296	2016-03-17T13:36:22	I can’t. 
SI_PeterKing	710459292055412736	2016-03-17T13:34:29	Our kalynkahler asks NFL wide receivers: What is a catch? Interesting to hear their thoughts. 
SI_PeterKing	710106890601103360	2016-03-16T14:14:10	Randy Moss. Jonathan Cooper. Interesting comparison. 
SI_PeterKing	710087835429294080	2016-03-16T12:58:27	As RossTuckerNFL said, anything Pats get from Cooper’s a bonus. He’s been a bust in Az. 
SI_PeterKing	710070500765007873	2016-03-16T11:49:34	My Wednesday column is up. Why NE traded a 26-year-old DE in his prime.

SI_PeterKing	709953873872613377	2016-03-16T04:06:08	Today Edwerderespn got 2 FedExs. 1 From Rachel__Nichols w/kid’s art wishing Christie well. 2 Handwritten sympathy note from Roger Goodell,
SI_PeterKing	709950843232129024	2016-03-16T03:54:05	FLOWER MOUND, Texas-Edwerderespn, daughter Christie, JennyVrentas tonight. 
SI_PeterKing	709933724310249472	2016-03-16T02:46:04	Agreed. Easy to do so with such a good person and great family. We need to support them in their time of need. 
SI_PeterKing	709927021028093952	2016-03-16T02:19:26	Today Edwerderespn gave 1 of the best eulogies I’ve ever heard. “Wish I didn’t have to say a word of it,’’ he said. 
SI_PeterKing	709925561720635393	2016-03-16T02:13:38	Hey SidHartman: Happy birthday. You only turn 96 once. Thanks for being a good man to so many in this business.
SI_PeterKing	709924948412727296	2016-03-16T02:11:12	A smart team would play him 600 snaps in a rotation. I figure New England knows that. 
SI_PeterKing	709924226665349120	2016-03-16T02:08:20	By the way, did I say how impressive Edwerderespn was today? Really impressive. What a guy. What a family.
SI_PeterKing	709923828898467842	2016-03-16T02:06:45	Essentially, Belichick just got a pitcher coming off Tommy John who’s healthier than he’s been in a while, JOEL9ONE, to put in DE rotation.
SI_PeterKing	709886101419261953	2016-03-15T23:36:50	You're a hell of a man, Edwerderespn.

SI_PeterKing	709743090693763074	2016-03-15T14:08:33	Michigan State QB Connor Cook, writing TheMMQB, on the whole not-a-captain thing, and more:

SI_PeterKing	709432232700674052	2016-03-14T17:33:19	Good place for him. John Harbaugh will love him. 
SI_PeterKing	709400875538718720	2016-03-14T15:28:43	Watch football much? 
SI_PeterKing	709397864343068672	2016-03-14T15:16:45	We’ll have to disagree on that. Think he’s the most imposing big receiver I’ve covered. 
SI_PeterKing	709357198061789186	2016-03-14T12:35:09	My words: I don’t think it’s very significant. 
SI_PeterKing	709356805667856384	2016-03-14T12:33:36	Good morning. MMQB is up:  Eagles, Osweiler’s call, and lovely words from JennyVrentas on the Werder sadness.
SI_PeterKing	709255301397028864	2016-03-14T05:50:15	My Monday column is live.  
SI_PeterKing	709091162875891713	2016-03-13T18:58:02	Rare that MMQB in full is filed at 2:55 pm Sunday. In it: Lovely tribute to Trey Bomar, Edwerderespn's late son-in-law, by JennyVrentas.
SI_PeterKing	708858503922843648	2016-03-13T03:33:31	Not saying they should. But I think it’s ridiculous to suggest Fitzpatrick is the idiot for not caving. 
SI_PeterKing	708858049696567297	2016-03-13T03:31:43	I meant two team bid for Osweiler. 
SI_PeterKing	708857683357667328	2016-03-13T03:30:16	True. Let’s see what happens if he’s not there on July 28 and Geno takes the first snap in camp. 
SI_PeterKing	708857451253260290	2016-03-13T03:29:20	Two teams bid seriously for him. 
SI_PeterKing	708856832949936129	2016-03-13T03:26:53	Not the point. Point is, Fitzpatrick throw 31 TDs last year and Jets have offered him a low contract for the market. 
SI_PeterKing	708856507501301760	2016-03-13T03:25:35	Three years, $33 million, maybe $14 guaranteed. Something like that. 
SI_PeterKing	708856181754884096	2016-03-13T03:24:18	Sorry. Fitzpatrick.
SI_PeterKing	708855823489961984	2016-03-13T03:22:52	I don’t think Fitzgerald should make Osweiler’s number, which is absurd. I also don’t think he should make Chase Daniel’s.
SI_PeterKing	708855604379578368	2016-03-13T03:22:00	Plus, it’s negotiating season. Who cares if a guy’s signed on March 12?
SI_PeterKing	708855456853319681	2016-03-13T03:21:25	Hard to understand those frustrated w/Fitzpatrick’s intransigence. Offered $11m less per year than a guy w/7 career starts+many questions.
SI_PeterKing	708819686469849091	2016-03-13T00:59:17	Once more, with feeling. So many have been inspired by Bomar/Werder families’ fight. We’re with you, Edwerderespn. 
SI_PeterKing	708803376537079808	2016-03-12T23:54:28	Yes, that would be me. Seven scenes, shot in a Sony lot in Hollywood, in 40 minutes.

SI_PeterKing	707845648759001088	2016-03-10T08:28:48	Jax was stuck on 6 years for a while. Vernon wanted 5. Jags went to 5 late in process, but Vernon just wanted NYC. 
SI_PeterKing	707845400414318592	2016-03-10T08:27:49	Final three: 1 NYG 2 Jax 3 NYJ Jets got out when money got over $15m per year. 
SI_PeterKing	707844355575386112	2016-03-10T08:23:40	Maybe you wouldn’t be, but I would. 
SI_PeterKing	707843657655828480	2016-03-10T08:20:53	No idea. I’d push for McCarron, but that’s just me. Maybe RG3 or Kaepernick or Connor Cook. Just too early to tell. 
SI_PeterKing	707843459793686528	2016-03-10T08:20:06	Just finished a story on Vernon signing with the Giants. Crazy ride. 
SI_PeterKing	707839611406520320	2016-03-10T08:04:49	No. But I doubt the NFL would do that to the Texans. 
SI_PeterKing	707789410520211458	2016-03-10T04:45:20	Never said this year. Just said a 4.

SI_PeterKing	707233997500375040	2016-03-08T15:58:19	I don’t see it, but you may know I have been wrong about such things before. Quite often. 
SI_PeterKing	707233771033124864	2016-03-08T15:57:25	I agree with Ebersol. He’d be better doing games. Would be educational about the inner game, with great stories. 
SI_PeterKing	707233222149726208	2016-03-08T15:55:14	You’re right about him missing fb. Never got the sense he wants to coach, but we’ll see. Don’t know what he’ll do. 
SI_PeterKing	707232458849296385	2016-03-08T15:52:12	Cool to me: Brady’s overriding feeling on the relief Manning would feel. Won’t have to think about fb all the time. 
SI_PeterKing	707231719972315137	2016-03-08T15:49:16	Sound bites? Okay.  
SI_PeterKing	707230107346325504	2016-03-08T15:42:51	Thanks a lot, Mark. Good seeing you and your team yesterday. denverpost did a really good job. 
SI_PeterKing	707229071835582464	2016-03-08T15:38:45	Other than the 1,600 words atop my Monday column? No. 
SI_PeterKing	707170021861101571	2016-03-08T11:44:06	Good morning. My report from Denver on the Manning retirement. 
SI_PeterKing	707018590080212994	2016-03-08T01:42:22	My story from the Manning retirement today.  
SI_PeterKing	706861344616611840	2016-03-07T15:17:32	DENVER-This morning's sports front of the Denver Post. 
SI_PeterKing	706745222361796608	2016-03-07T07:36:06	MMQB is up.  
SI_PeterKing	706719703528439809	2016-03-07T05:54:42	Brady told me he envied what Manning had with brothers Eli and Cooper. “I don’t have brothers,’’ he said. “Great to see what they have.”
SI_PeterKing	706719440692359168	2016-03-07T05:53:39	Brady and Manning have the kind of relationship that few major rivals have. Wives know and like each other. They hang out.
SI_PeterKing	706718610211737600	2016-03-07T05:50:21	More in MMQB in a couple of hours. Fun column tonight.
SI_PeterKing	706718505949736960	2016-03-07T05:49:56	Brady3: On what he learned from Manning: “Every game he has played, I have watched."
SI_PeterKing	706718228962107392	2016-03-07T05:48:50	Brady2: “That part sucks. That part really sucks. That part will always suck.''
SI_PeterKing	706718169021308928	2016-03-07T05:48:36	Brady1: Talked to Tom Brady re Manning for MMQB. I asked him about not having PM to play against now. His thoughts:
SI_PeterKing	706649170786975744	2016-03-07T01:14:25	Weddle’s right. This is a heck of a column by Kravitz. 
SI_PeterKing	706649025961824256	2016-03-07T01:13:51	Really great job, Ross. Loved reading it. 
SI_PeterKing	706455574767116288	2016-03-06T12:25:08	Mort breaks it. 
SI_PeterKing	706231844090597377	2016-03-05T21:36:07	NFL teams are an average of $28.04 million under the cap today. No wonder agents are frothing at the mouth for free-agency.
SI_PeterKing	706228474814533637	2016-03-05T21:22:44	Now theMMQB, emilymkaplan on gregolsen88 preparing for his life’s work, as Chuck Noll used to say. 
SI_PeterKing	705856602750984193	2016-03-04T20:45:02	Great tribute, Scott. Bud Collins was one-of-a-kind. RIP.

SI_PeterKing	705402121961615360	2016-03-03T14:39:06	Re RobertKlemko’s story on Manning/Naughright, he presented the facts. You decide who to believe.

SI_PeterKing	705231529992126464	2016-03-03T03:21:13	Proud to work with all theMMQB. Jenny and Robert did stuff this week that makes it so rewarding to watch them excel.
SI_PeterKing	705230582951890945	2016-03-03T03:17:28	One point: Really proud to work w/JennyVrentas and RobertKlemko. Very good reporters. Conscientious. Honest. Future of biz in great hands.
SI_PeterKing	705164503906910209	2016-03-02T22:54:53	Our RobertKlemko investigating the Manning/Naughright story with some news: 
SI_PeterKing	705148810444410880	2016-03-02T21:52:32	Thanks, Jason. All credit to gumshoe RobertKlemko. 
SI_PeterKing	705100525352689664	2016-03-02T18:40:40	For theMMQB, RobertKlemko reported this story for 2 wks, from Mississippi to Georgia to Tenn to Florida. His work:

SI_PeterKing	704823365845061633	2016-03-02T00:19:20	Grant! I am blushing! Stop! 
SI_PeterKing	704817357491929092	2016-03-01T23:55:27	Good stuff, Andrew. To keep Bradford off market, and ensure they’d have his rights for 2017, costs $22m. 
SI_PeterKing	704814454106681344	2016-03-01T23:43:55	ICYMI: JennyVrentas with one of the best pieces I’ve read from any Scouting Combine. 
SI_PeterKing	704813872172109824	2016-03-01T23:41:36	Thanks for the interview, Maggie. We had a good talk. 
SI_PeterKing	704781004666499074	2016-03-01T21:31:00	The Marvelous One with a note I wish I’d thought of. 
SI_PeterKing	704780505972150272	2016-03-01T21:29:01	Good way to put it, Gregg. 
SI_PeterKing	704780364628283392	2016-03-01T21:28:27	Bradford $18m/yr, per AdamSchefter. Makes sense. Trial period for Bradford/Pederson on both sides.
SI_PeterKing	704780036952313856	2016-03-01T21:27:09	Eagles and Sam Bradford with a 2-year deal. Interesting. Thought he’d be a candidate for SF if a free man.
SI_PeterKing	704725243634520064	2016-03-01T17:49:25	That is grotesque. 
SI_PeterKing	704724776812675072	2016-03-01T17:47:34	To: Sports Media. If this is true, it might be time to consider a boycott of Marriott properties.

SI_PeterKing	704347007977168897	2016-02-29T16:46:27	MMQB: On a prospect who’s never gotten a B. On the logistical hurdles of the 2016 Rams. On Manning taking his time. 
SI_PeterKing	704272422984425472	2016-02-29T11:50:05	Good morning. MMQB is up. The North Dakota governor checks in. 
SI_PeterKing	704229763754229760	2016-02-29T09:00:34	MMQB is up.  
SI_PeterKing	704183624732647424	2016-02-29T05:57:13	I do believe this will be the first MMQB in which the governor of North Dakota is quoted.
SI_PeterKing	704183077036277760	2016-02-29T05:55:03	Still writing. Don’t know. North Dakotans will want to read this one. 
SI_PeterKing	704122158528778240	2016-02-29T01:52:59	Go get ‘em, Spotlight.

SI_PeterKing	703963403124154368	2016-02-28T15:22:08	This is fantastic. Look! StephenCurry30 misses the normal shots, hits the bombs. Great chart, Dax. 
SI_PeterKing	703962649223143424	2016-02-28T15:19:09	Seriously, because I don’t know the measurement: How long was that last shot? That could well be the first highlight the day he makes HoF.
SI_PeterKing	703961326025048064	2016-02-28T15:13:53	Great Q. Maybe the 85% QB w/real pressure on 60% of his throws. That’s the amazing part. Curry’s being covered. 
SI_PeterKing	703960567183220736	2016-02-28T15:10:52	Our JennyVrentas happened upon a few coaches watching the end of the StephenCurry30 game at Combine. All were transfixed. Couldn’t leave.
SI_PeterKing	703960082770485248	2016-02-28T15:08:57	I agree. Trying to come with comps from other sports. Really, right now, I’m not sure there is one. 
SI_PeterKing	703958311192936448	2016-02-28T15:01:54	I don’t know what to say about Steph Curry that hasn’t been said, so I’ll leave it at this: Holy #%^&amp;*. What a pleasure to watch.

SI_PeterKing	692740183347826688	2016-01-28T16:05:04	As emilymkaplan notes, the Manning-CMatthews-Peppers/HGH story’s a rabbit hole that likely won’t yield any rabbits.

SI_PeterKing	691706677184315396	2016-01-25T19:38:17	I disagree, Turd. A man is allowed to not play and not get paid. 
SI_PeterKing	691706247754694656	2016-01-25T19:36:35	Different story. Brady’s been in 10 conference title games. In his first, Palmer had 6 turnovers. 
SI_PeterKing	691705379676405764	2016-01-25T19:33:08	Disagree totally. He’s allowed to choose not to play, and not get paid, if he wishes. That was his wish w/Bengals.

SI_PeterKing	691591080878297088	2016-01-25T11:58:57	Crowd was a factor in that game. No question. Pats lost a lot when they lost home field in week 17. 
SI_PeterKing	691590890096164864	2016-01-25T11:58:11	Panthers are really good. Your team had a great year. But the QB just had too many brainlock plays. You’ll be back.

SI_PeterKing	691472692390686720	2016-01-25T04:08:31	Thought so. 
SI_PeterKing	691472420654284800	2016-01-25T04:07:26	Anyone in North America forecast a Carolina-Denver Super Bowl back on Labor Day?
SI_PeterKing	691472259848884224	2016-01-25T04:06:48	Congrats to the Panthers and Broncos, two deserving Super Bowl teams with playmakers on both sides of the ball. SB 50’s going to be fun.
SI_PeterKing	691396761542270976	2016-01-24T23:06:48	Den just saved 23 seconds for New England on the last 3 plays of that drive.
SI_PeterKing	691396479559168001	2016-01-24T23:05:40	Why Den just snapped the ball with 13 seconds left on play clock is beyond me. Bad clock management.
SI_PeterKing	691384736808202241	2016-01-24T22:19:01	If NE comes back to win, that play by Malcolm Butler will be huge. Instinctive and physical tackle preventing the first down.
SI_PeterKing	691364766208536576	2016-01-24T20:59:39	Terrific double move by Daniels.
SI_PeterKing	691364125599862784	2016-01-24T20:57:07	Like Von Miller was the intended receiver.
SI_PeterKing	691356117880836096	2016-01-24T20:25:17	Manning’s average throw was 11 yards past LOS on that first drive. Not so much of a horizontal game here to begin for him.
SI_PeterKing	691332895470784512	2016-01-24T18:53:01	We’re having a meeting in the press box right now to discuss that. Got any ideas for top-notch excuses we could use? 
SI_PeterKing	691328877428248576	2016-01-24T18:37:03	Should be around 48 degrees with low winds and no rain at kickoff here in Denver. Fairly windless on the field now.

SI_PeterKing	689676058308771840	2016-01-20T05:09:20	Quite a day. Just finished a long piece on why the owners picked the Rams for L.A. That was a fun one. It’ll be up in the morning.
SI_PeterKing	689567584879001600	2016-01-19T21:58:18	I did in my Monday column. 5 of the 22 OT games this year ended with an offensive TD on the first possession. 
SI_PeterKing	689566837261082624	2016-01-19T21:55:20	Seems gimmicky to me. But no system is perfect. 
SI_PeterKing	689566664107651072	2016-01-19T21:54:38	She does a terrific job. So glad to have her on the team. 
SI_PeterKing	689566349606129664	2016-01-19T21:53:23	PA doesn’t want to add 25% more snaps to a game. More injury risk. I agree. 
SI_PeterKing	689566208526516225	2016-01-19T21:52:50	No system is perfect. It is more fair for both teams to possess than it is now, when coin flip to determine who gets it first
SI_PeterKing	689565979165196288	2016-01-19T21:51:55	My point on OT is simple: If coin flip isn’t such a big factor, why have 99% percent of flip winners in OT chosen the ball first?
SI_PeterKing	689565548527632384	2016-01-19T21:50:12	Sudden death once the second team gets first offensive snap. 
SI_PeterKing	689564381483552769	2016-01-19T21:45:34	I disagree, unless second team has a great defense. Even then, I still think most teams would kick off to start OT.

SI_PeterKing	689142475760492544	2016-01-18T17:49:04	‘Greatest touchdown pass of Palmer’s life, the one that won his first playoff game of a distinguished 13-yr NFL career… Thrown left-handed.'

SI_PeterKing	689043407000465408	2016-01-18T11:15:24	Smart column by our Andy_Benoit on his favorite Carson Palmer play vs Pack.

SI_PeterKing	688983122369753088	2016-01-18T07:15:51	Holy crap. What a throw—and about to get smashed by Markus Golden too. How about the 60-yard rainbow on 4th+20?

SI_PeterKing	688981182567067648	2016-01-18T07:08:09	Great year for the Steelers. Promising year for Keith Butler. Future very bright in the ‘Burgh. 
SI_PeterKing	688980992003018753	2016-01-18T07:07:23	Well, some would love you (or anyone but me) to have my job. But I’m not surrendering it yet. 
SI_PeterKing	688980826197995520	2016-01-18T07:06:44	See you there! 
SI_PeterKing	688980664587276289	2016-01-18T07:06:05	We’ll never all agree on OT rules. I think both teams should be guaranteed a possession but I get why others don’t. 
SI_PeterKing	688980420260659200	2016-01-18T07:05:07	Looking like the Cards atop the column. What a thrill ride that game was. You will love Arians’ story of the winning touchdown.
SI_PeterKing	688980001593626624	2016-01-18T07:03:27	How’s everyone doing?
SI_PeterKing	688979928776323073	2016-01-18T07:03:10	This MMQB tonight is a kaleidoscope of fun. I’m having a ball writing it.
SI_PeterKing	688733067939303424	2016-01-17T14:42:14	I don’t know. So strange. Cutler’s so easy to get along with normally. 
SI_PeterKing	688732825986682880	2016-01-17T14:41:16	No. I am told no team requested permission to interview him this month. 
SI_PeterKing	688730733947543552	2016-01-17T14:32:57	7 coach openings. 7 go offense. None interview coordinator of top-scoring offense in football since he’s run it ('12), Josh McDaniels.
SI_PeterKing	688729986698735616	2016-01-17T14:29:59	Great moment. Kudos to LarryFitzgerald. 
SI_PeterKing	688719782225539072	2016-01-17T13:49:26	Has been my stance forever. Both teams should be guaranteed an OT possession. We’ll see if GB lobbies for it this yr 
SI_PeterKing	688574990745219072	2016-01-17T04:14:05	Yes you can. 
SI_PeterKing	688571989175463937	2016-01-17T04:02:09	Man has a point. 
SI_PeterKing	688571388702097408	2016-01-17T03:59:46	What a game.
SI_PeterKing	688571193998348289	2016-01-17T03:59:00	These are the measurements that try men’s souls.
SI_PeterKing	688569604499705857	2016-01-17T03:52:41	Larry Fitzgerald (generous spot notwithstanding) is one of the great players of our time.
SI_PeterKing	688564323673853952	2016-01-17T03:31:42	It’s a catch. Can’t overturn that.
SI_PeterKing	688561767161671680	2016-01-17T03:21:32	If it were a glazed cruller, I would claw his eyes out to get it. 
SI_PeterKing	688560302514925568	2016-01-17T03:15:43	When in doubt, Fitzgerald.
SI_PeterKing	688520792833941504	2016-01-17T00:38:43	What a colossal waste of time by the Chiefs.
SI_PeterKing	688374376383811585	2016-01-16T14:56:55	Hey mortreport: Football world is thinking of you today.
SI_PeterKing	688103171202273281	2016-01-15T20:59:15	Sending good thoughts to a very good man, mortreport, as he begins a tough fight. Please join me. 
SI_PeterKing	688000614450761732	2016-01-15T14:11:43	I think Blakeman’s a heck of a good referee. They all err, but he has good control of game. 
SI_PeterKing	688000422016086016	2016-01-15T14:10:57	Interesting point from MikeOHaraNFL: Caldwell’s 4 half-seasons as Lions coach: 2014: 6-2, 5-3. 2015: 1-7, 6-2.
SI_PeterKing	687999531577913346	2016-01-15T14:07:25	He has not. It is a major goal of his. 
SI_PeterKing	687998889245437952	2016-01-15T14:04:52	The highly respected footballzebras thinks SB 50 ref will be Corrente or Blakeman. 
SI_PeterKing	687998465146793984	2016-01-15T14:03:11	Smart move by the new GM. Caldwell universally respected by players, staff, ownership.

SI_PeterKing	687840858729742336	2016-01-15T03:36:54	
SI_PeterKing	687840169043558402	2016-01-15T03:34:10	Right. That should have been 3. 
SI_PeterKing	687839998830358528	2016-01-15T03:33:29	People who slam the New York Times are one of two things: 1 Non-readers. 2 Dopes.
SI_PeterKing	687771469036785668	2016-01-14T23:01:11	So, six hires so far. Five offensive coordinators (Koetter, Jackson, Pederson, McAdoo, Gase). One offensive head coach (Kelly). — Ten? Det?
SI_PeterKing	687765836426264576	2016-01-14T22:38:48	If Pederson-to-Eagle true: --- NFC East coaches 1990: BParcells, BRyan, JGibbs, JJohnson. 2016: BMcAdoo, DPederson, JGruden, JGarrett.
SI_PeterKing	687764344990482432	2016-01-14T22:32:52	That is a legitimate wow. 
SI_PeterKing	687739802381324288	2016-01-14T20:55:21	Interesting. Kelly quite smart coming out of Oregon. Goes 26-21 in 3 seasons. Gets fired. Now is stupid. Football analysis is funny.
SI_PeterKing	687738636771700741	2016-01-14T20:50:43	No. 
SI_PeterKing	687721633855991808	2016-01-14T19:43:09	Good move by Niners, giving a smart coach a second chance when he’ll be burning to prove the Eagles wrong. 
SI_PeterKing	687715948799913984	2016-01-14T19:20:33	Great work, Kevin. Really enlightening story. 
SI_PeterKing	687636160647147520	2016-01-14T14:03:31	CORR:He was the only Bill on my all pro team. I’d take Watkins over him, but Incog’s as good a G as Watkins is a WR 
SI_PeterKing	687634217166106625	2016-01-14T13:55:47	Excellent post, Mr. Florio. 
SI_PeterKing	687633609851801601	2016-01-14T13:53:22	I second that, Evan. Don’t be afraid of analytics. As SI_DougFarrar writes, they won’t bite. 
SI_PeterKing	687629007429447680	2016-01-14T13:35:05	Smart story from robertmays. Why don’t teams winning the coin flip choose to receive anymore? Sea change here.

SI_PeterKing	687344073594789888	2016-01-13T18:42:52	Yes. 1 You’ve been to playoffs 5 yrs in row. 2 You have a QB. 3 You have solid pool of young talent. 
SI_PeterKing	687343112176418816	2016-01-13T18:39:02	Hue2: Would have been sick if he let Cleve job go, then got stuck without a job when other jobs filled.
SI_PeterKing	687343062289379328	2016-01-13T18:38:50	Hue1: People wondering why Hue took Cleve job with NYG, SF, TB jobs out there. Simple: Cleve offered him the job. Wanted badly to be HC.
SI_PeterKing	687342378877894656	2016-01-13T18:36:07	Very good question from a very good reporter. 
SI_PeterKing	687337367917719553	2016-01-13T18:16:13	Hue Jackson gets Browns job, per MikeSilver. Superb hire. Jackson made Dalton better and maximized Cin weapons. Congrats to him and Browns.

SI_PeterKing	686267078643462145	2016-01-10T19:23:16	Brown may decide to make a change (I’m dubious about it) but he won’t be rushed into it by Hue’s interviews with SF, Cleve.
SI_PeterKing	686266979741757440	2016-01-10T19:22:52	Tough call. Lot of factors. Mike Brown doesn’t do knee-jerk. Five straight playoff seasons. Likes working w/Marvin. 
SI_PeterKing	686264498043367428	2016-01-10T19:13:01	Great point John. That’s really showing up today.

SI_PeterKing	685812305007919104	2016-01-09T13:16:09	Thanks to Bill Littlefield and NPR for having me on. Fun interview.

SI_PeterKing	685500067290157057	2016-01-08T16:35:26	Friday Game Plan column is up theMMQB from robertmays. Previewing the weekend, plus fun stuff. 
SI_PeterKing	685485560639557633	2016-01-08T15:37:48	Smart move by Falcons owner Arthur Blank, not blowing up Quinn-Dimitroff after one year.
SI_PeterKing	685450155957473282	2016-01-08T13:17:06	Today’s the 10-yr anniversary of Steeler Wild Card win at Cincinnati. Carson Palmer got knee shredded that day. Cin 0-6 in playoffs since.

SI_PeterKing	685264858737197057	2016-01-08T01:00:48	It's almost TV time from Canton. About to release the 15 finalists for the Hall of Fame Class of 2016. 
SI_PeterKing	685164107712970754	2016-01-07T18:20:27	Well, okay now. I shall never write a cross word about this great dog humanitarian again. 
SI_PeterKing	685162645079523328	2016-01-07T18:14:38	If alexmarvez is in, then I’m in too. Fri night. Organized by Combine Social Director AngieSix. Beer will happen. 
SI_PeterKing	685161616468398081	2016-01-07T18:10:33	Photo of the Year. Good dog! 
SI_PeterKing	685151423156367364	2016-01-07T17:30:03	Stunning. Didn’t see it coming. Don’t know much now. Traveling. Will try to learn more when I can. 
SI_PeterKing	685151021857923074	2016-01-07T17:28:27	As robertmays writes, it’s not about simply throwing. It’s about throwing downfield. Palmer, Ben, Cam do it. 
SI_PeterKing	685148721127010305	2016-01-07T17:19:19	I know how hard GregABedard worked to make this happen. Congrats to him. These stories are hard to do. 
SI_PeterKing	685148489295204353	2016-01-07T17:18:23	This is a gem of a story inside the Houston Texans by GregABedard. Really terrific access, insight.

SI_PeterKing	684882640059678720	2016-01-06T23:42:00	I never said he should be in. I simply said all players should be judged based on what they did on the field. 
SI_PeterKing	684882150508916742	2016-01-06T23:40:03	NFL Mythology 101. 
SI_PeterKing	684881822300422145	2016-01-06T23:38:45	Will he? 
SI_PeterKing	684881460889796609	2016-01-06T23:37:19	Count me among those who think Tim Raines absolutely should be in.
SI_PeterKing	684845609656938498	2016-01-06T21:14:51	If Mularkey+Caldwell stay, just 5 openings: Cle, Phil, Mia, NYG, SF. (Barring a stunner.) Not exactly a gold mine for ready coordinators.
SI_PeterKing	684843117242101763	2016-01-06T21:04:57	I believe so, but what if Allen was DC all yr? Good for SP for staying. Greatest decade in Saints history continues. 
SI_PeterKing	684839875821088769	2016-01-06T20:52:04	Well, I’m assuming johnlegend likes music. I do know he knows football.
SI_PeterKing	684839597373800449	2016-01-06T20:50:58	What do johnlegend + judybattista have in common? 1 Both like music. 2 Both voted for theMMQB’s 2015 NFL awards! 
SI_PeterKing	684838571455418368	2016-01-06T20:46:53	Now themmqb: Someone who knows Paul DePodesta well, SI’s Tom Verducci, on DeP’s stunning hire by Browns: 
SI_PeterKing	684829180069023749	2016-01-06T20:09:34	No. 
SI_PeterKing	684805228131139584	2016-01-06T18:34:24	Credit SI_ChrisStone. His idea. But thanks—anything Verducci writes, at least IMO, is something I read right away. 
SI_PeterKing	684774836120481792	2016-01-06T16:33:38	On a personal note: Thanks to Tom Verducci for his contribution to theMMQB on DePodesta. Thanks for SI_ChrisStone for the loan of TV.
SI_PeterKing	684774457693605888	2016-01-06T16:32:07	SI’s Tom Verducci on the Browns’ hire of Paul DePodesta. Now this is some strong insight. 
SI_PeterKing	684765329428463616	2016-01-06T15:55:51	Part of the story I think got lost when Niners dealt Smith to KC. Good work by JennyVrentas. 
SI_PeterKing	684735610456772608	2016-01-06T13:57:45	Later today theMMQB: SI’s Tom Verducci with a terrific column on the meaning of Cleveland’s hire of Paul DePodesta. It’s great.

SI_PeterKing	684510495567671296	2016-01-05T23:03:14	Our JennyVrentas with a gem on how Alex Smith has changed Andy Reid. Really insightful. 
SI_PeterKing	684423819973509123	2016-01-05T17:18:49	I don’t see it that way. It’s an admission that they stink, have stunk for yrs, and want to try something different. 
SI_PeterKing	684423270683308032	2016-01-05T17:16:38	Easy thing to do on very outside-the-box move is rip it. I want to look into it a bit. 
SI_PeterKing	684421926115241984	2016-01-05T17:11:17	Count me as intrigued by what Browns are doing. Not sure it’s going to work, but I respect the thought process.

SI_PeterKing	684214863099478017	2016-01-05T03:28:30	Won’t be surprised when bkravitz writes the backstory if Andrew Luck had some (even very small) part in Pagano staying.
SI_PeterKing	684205316716802050	2016-01-05T02:50:34	Sing it with me … Kumbaya my Lord, Kumbaya … Oh Lord, Kumbaya …

SI_PeterKing	684095217704763392	2016-01-04T19:33:04	Have not gotten to know a finer man than Tom Coughlin in my 32 seasons covering the NFL. Good luck to him, whatever the future holds.
SI_PeterKing	684072764752400384	2016-01-04T18:03:51	Ballots flowing in for TheMMQB NFL awards. Quite good so far. RSherman_25 and johnlegend (who loves football in a big way) check in.

SI_PeterKing	684021746106634242	2016-01-04T14:41:07	The Browns don't want Manziel. I bet most teams feel the same way.  
SI_PeterKing	684018889223745536	2016-01-04T14:29:46	As of this morning: who's out, who seems safe, and who's 50/50 among coaches.

SI_PeterKing	683989948341596166	2016-01-04T12:34:46	Cleveland + KC + Woodson + coaching news, “haunted” rushing champ chasing Emmitt, etc. Football out the wazoo. 
SI_PeterKing	683981361460457472	2016-01-04T12:00:38	MMQB is up. Good morning everyone.

SI_PeterKing	683818807840890880	2016-01-04T01:14:43	Hmmm. Hope the new coach likes analytics. 
SI_PeterKing	683813381200019456	2016-01-04T00:53:09	JFF3: … Browns are so done with the guy. I will be stunned if he ever plays another snap for Cleveland. He wants to go to Dallas.
SI_PeterKing	683813276828971008	2016-01-04T00:52:44	JFF2: … even if they’re not playing. Manziel didn’t show up Sunday. Browns couldn’t reach him on phone. At this point I can tell you …
SI_PeterKing	683813156469211136	2016-01-04T00:52:15	JFF1: Reported this on SNFonNBC re Manziel: Browns require players in concussion protocol to be seen by team medic at 9 am on Sunday …

SI_PeterKing	683799600038318080	2016-01-03T23:58:23	Pettine must be happy that in about 15 minutes Johnny Football is not going to be his concern again. Ever.

SI_PeterKing	682679208217309184	2015-12-31T21:46:21	Yes. Soccer, field hockey and softball. I know the concussion stats now. Might be a factor in my decision today. 
SI_PeterKing	682678968185655296	2015-12-31T21:45:24	“League of Denial’’ was vital and very good. “Concussion’’ is what I’d call a noble Hollywood version of the story. 
SI_PeterKing	682678616115773440	2015-12-31T21:44:00	Probably eliminating the kickoff, for one thing. Most are gone now anyway. Much else to do too. 
SI_PeterKing	682678423458852864	2015-12-31T21:43:14	Didn’t like it—from my knowledge of Duerson. But I don’t know everything about why it was done that way. 
SI_PeterKing	682678023993339905	2015-12-31T21:41:39	Very good way to put it. For education’s sake I strongly recommend seeing it. You want to know what you’re watching. 
SI_PeterKing	682677640109633537	2015-12-31T21:40:07	He is 7th on RobertKlemko list of candidates, hot off the presses today theMMQB.

SI_PeterKing	682676440479993856	2015-12-31T21:35:21	I don’t have one, but probably not. And certainly not before high school. But flag football, yes.
