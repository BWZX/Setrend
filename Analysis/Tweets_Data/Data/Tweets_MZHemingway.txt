MZHemingway	708724430885818369	2016-03-12T18:40:46	Trump has every legal right to conduct a rally w/o violent disruption. What he lacks is any moral authority to whine about what he created.

MZHemingway	708738337520132097	2016-03-12T19:36:02	Because they’re ignorant of origins of progressive education and think it started a few years ago? Probably right. 
MZHemingway	708717744384974848	2016-03-12T18:14:12	But we've spent so long ripping out the moral anchors that let us sow dignified peace in a convincing commanding way

MZHemingway	705746275099136000	2016-03-04T13:26:38	The most accurate assessment of Trump's debate performance last night comes from AceofSpadesHQ 
MZHemingway	705744244405886976	2016-03-04T13:18:34	Amazing catch by MichaelRWarren on Trump as "world class businessman" from debate  
MZHemingway	705744343433281536	2016-03-04T13:18:58	I came up with a good analogy for what Trump is like: Drunk A's fan. Hear me out. 
MZHemingway	705743251395850240	2016-03-04T13:14:37	ThePlumLineGS amandacarpenter hard to measure the significance of all his insult-interruptions, though. Brief time, huge impact.

MZHemingway	705646152620740608	2016-03-04T06:48:47	One thing is clear: the Fox News Twitter feed is now a PR arm of the Trump campaign
MZHemingway	705646363111923712	2016-03-04T06:49:37	Is everything OK? Did what happened to Chris Christie happen over there? Is this a cry for help? 
MZHemingway	705638409268662272	2016-03-04T06:18:01	Tonight realDonaldTrump finally took an actual position. But as soon as the debate was over, his handlers made him reverse himself.
MZHemingway	705078292873879552	2016-03-02T17:12:19	Time for smod2016 to drop out of this race and get behind someone who can stop Trump. 
MZHemingway	705600390310596608	2016-03-04T03:46:57	thinking the military will do what u tell them even if it’s unlawful is about as close to fascism as it gets
MZHemingway	705633446412943360	2016-03-04T05:58:18	.JonahNRO Um, newsier than a completely stupid ‘pledge', Jonah? I don’t think so. Let’s not be silly.
MZHemingway	705632123160428546	2016-03-04T05:53:02	I mean, they did kind of crush him like the smooshed innards of a gooey Cuban sandwich, now that you think about it. 
MZHemingway	705618325410324480	2016-03-04T04:58:13	You mock Trump University, but I graduated from there and turned out fine. Now I have to go buy a $10,000 magic bean from a guy in a van.
MZHemingway	705630479324549120	2016-03-04T05:46:30	Was there anything about the behavior of the American electorate in 2008 and especially 2012 that didn’t presage this moment?
MZHemingway	705627327607083008	2016-03-04T05:33:59	Ignorance is not a virtue.
MZHemingway	705627267720826881	2016-03-04T05:33:45	Trump: We should build safe zones in Syria for the refugees.  It will happen because soldiers will commit war crimes when I say so.
MZHemingway	705625261052530689	2016-03-04T05:25:46	So is that his third position on the issue this day alone? His core really is flexible. 
MZHemingway	705623996797038592	2016-03-04T05:20:45	Sasse to Hannity: "What you're doing is bullsh-t."

MZHemingway	705622969096151042	2016-03-04T05:16:40	One baked-in problem with journalism is incentive for reporters pick easy-peasy angles, not actually important angles. PLEDGE
MZHemingway	705620485925507072	2016-03-04T05:06:48	If you’re a reporter and you couldn’t figure that out, quit immediately and never return. You are bad at your job.

MZHemingway	705619335096586245	2016-03-04T05:02:13	Pretty hilarious to watch Dem media pretend a pledge that literally no one believes is The Big Story. Quality journalisming right there.
MZHemingway	705619236958375936	2016-03-04T05:01:50	excellent point.  
MZHemingway	705617330743566336	2016-03-04T04:54:16	Understatement of the era.

MZHemingway	705611237879631874	2016-03-04T04:30:03	MZHemingway why it's so hard to "make the case" to an ill society against Trump from within same ill society. No one to trust. seanmdav
MZHemingway	705611088348327937	2016-03-04T04:29:27	subtlerfugue well, he did, actually. But I still didn’t like the question.

MZHemingway	705609299263762432	2016-03-04T04:22:21	torriangray I think this is a reasonable theory.

MZHemingway	705606043317841920	2016-03-04T04:09:24	Yeah, we switched to CNN while O’Reilly interviewed the blusterer, but CNN was replaying bluster. So ... 
MZHemingway	705605669907361792	2016-03-04T04:07:55	Thought we had good tolerance but we just turned off the television because we couldn’t handle the Trump interviews or replays.
MZHemingway	705605108919177217	2016-03-04T04:05:42	shannon_last you’re the best
MZHemingway	705605056804950020	2016-03-04T04:05:29	Mostly wondering just how tiny it is. Cause that’s a lot of bluster.
MZHemingway	705604605644660736	2016-03-04T04:03:42	O’Reilly trying to get Trump to actually answer questions, succeeding unevenly.
MZHemingway	705604500858376192	2016-03-04T04:03:17	1) Megyn Kelly 2) Cruz 3) Rubio 4) Drunk audience 5) Kasich 6) Twitter 7) Trump
MZHemingway	705603749117464577	2016-03-04T04:00:17	I kind of miss the shrieking girl.
MZHemingway	705603390852636672	2016-03-04T03:58:52	Will you definitively support nominee even if it’s not you? Trump: Yes
MZHemingway	705603055887130625	2016-03-04T03:57:32	Would you support Donald Trump as nominee? Rubio: Yes. Cruz: Yes. Kasich: Already am! (Just kidding)
MZHemingway	705602548963500033	2016-03-04T03:55:31	Mom: At this point, I’ll even take Kasich. Me: Really? Mom: Just kidding.
MZHemingway	705601502455291904	2016-03-04T03:51:22	Wallace: Do you think Trump is naive about Russia? Kasich: I’m not biting.  (will do nothing to quell rumors he’s in to help Trump)
MZHemingway	705601006344646656	2016-03-04T03:49:24	KevJames91 BethRS62 aaronrobinow “record” ha. Yes, record turnout, both to vote for him and, even more, to vote against.
MZHemingway	705600657739239424	2016-03-04T03:48:00	KevJames91 BethRS62 nationwide they end the lives of more than 330,000 children each year. Just fyi.
MZHemingway	705600499098071041	2016-03-04T03:47:23	Trump’s interruptions are just absolutely disgusting. He’s sad and disgusting and like a drunk and a boor.
MZHemingway	705600328578629633	2016-03-04T03:46:42	Rubio: Once again, Trump was pressed on a policy issue to show whether he understood and he instead attacked and insulted.
MZHemingway	705600142158630913	2016-03-04T03:45:57	Oh man. Trump usually recovers better. He flubbed that “I’d force military to bomb children” answer earlier and should have backtracked.
MZHemingway	705600034016858112	2016-03-04T03:45:32	KevJames91 BethRS62 aaronrobinow “And we want it so bad that we don’t care if we’re sabotaging ourselves. Anger. Betrayal."
MZHemingway	705599866538369024	2016-03-04T03:44:52	AWillieWood No, I’m writing in the Trumpian style.
MZHemingway	705599500228759552	2016-03-04T03:43:24	Tying it to whether he can be trusted was what sold it. 
MZHemingway	705599253767258112	2016-03-04T03:42:26	BethRS62 KevJames91 aaronrobinow “But other than the massacre, good company. Great work.” And people fall for this.
MZHemingway	705598702518337536	2016-03-04T03:40:14	Cruz: People who support 2nd amendment, religious liberty, etc. don’t cut checks to HRC, as Trump has.
MZHemingway	705598551766618112	2016-03-04T03:39:38	YASSSSSS 
MZHemingway	705598478739636224	2016-03-04T03:39:21	Cruz: Donald, I know it’s hard not to interrupt but try. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
MZHemingway	705598388591439873	2016-03-04T03:38:59	Cruz: “Donald has a tenuous relationship with the truth."
MZHemingway	705598136916381696	2016-03-04T03:37:59	“My opening offer is that I support the 2nd Amendment. I’m flexible." 
MZHemingway	705597752693039104	2016-03-04T03:36:28	Baier: You once supported assault weapons ban. Now? Trump: I’m currently a big 2nd Amendment defender. For the time being.
MZHemingway	705597464120676352	2016-03-04T03:35:19	And this was one of his best points all night. If Trump wants to use that poll, then he's stuck with all of it. 
MZHemingway	705597260038410241	2016-03-04T03:34:30	Baier: You want to talk about religious liberty? Trump: I don’t have much to say. Didn’t like Obergefell.
MZHemingway	705597162072072192	2016-03-04T03:34:07	Cruz: Religious liberty is a lifelong passion. Spent 2 decades on it. Mentions 3 cases he fought, won before SCOTUS.
MZHemingway	705597002663350273	2016-03-04T03:33:29	Baier: Thoughts on gay adoption? Cruz: State based question. Obergefell destroyed state marriage laws. Religious liberty is threatened.
MZHemingway	705596702296666112	2016-03-04T03:32:17	I have no idea what Kasich is saying about the law. He’s either saying there is no religious freedom or he’s changing his previous view?
MZHemingway	705596555156287489	2016-03-04T03:31:42	Baier: Do same-sex marriage dissenters have rights? Kasich: Not really but people should stop being mean to them.
MZHemingway	705594771830661120	2016-03-04T03:24:37	In our lifetime, we will watch Andy Samberg become an old man.
MZHemingway	705595478482690049	2016-03-04T03:27:26	I get why so many ppl love Trump &amp; hate the GOP. But if Trump elected, and fails those folks -- and he will -- it's gonna be very ugly.
MZHemingway	705595718682083328	2016-03-04T03:28:23	chemistmom I was! He seemed to be encouraging us to kill ourselves! I was joking that it was compelling.
MZHemingway	705593029420134401	2016-03-04T03:17:42	So it turns out that if you attack Trump, he kind of melts down. Imagine if GOPers had done it in the fall.
MZHemingway	705595281769832448	2016-03-04T03:26:39	davidwkay thank you!

MZHemingway	705593225898102784	2016-03-04T03:18:28	Katich’s suicide talk is actually … compelling?
MZHemingway	705592917511921664	2016-03-04T03:17:15	Trump: pollpollpoll Cruz: Trump is obsessed with polls. Trump: No I’m not. Cruz: That poll you cited showed me beating HRC, you losing.
MZHemingway	705592714696400897	2016-03-04T03:16:27	What is Donald Trump even attempting to say?
MZHemingway	705592463537213441	2016-03-04T03:15:27	Cruz: Learn not to interrupt, Donald. Count to 10. If you don’t want him to be the nominee, if you believe in freedom, stand with us.
MZHemingway	705592178655916032	2016-03-04T03:14:19	Cruz: Let me ask the voters at home. Is this the debate you want playing out in the general election? Not economy, constitutional rights?
MZHemingway	705592045151256576	2016-03-04T03:13:47	Rubio: You hurt people. Trump: INSULT INSULT INSULT POO POO Rubio says: Notice he’s not apologizing to those he scammed. Just insults.
MZHemingway	705591753638719488	2016-03-04T03:12:37	Rubio: This is important because he’s trying to do to the United States what he did to the victims at Trump U.
MZHemingway	705591687381274624	2016-03-04T03:12:22	My mind just wandered to ponder the question of whether rich bullies or bullies who aren’t rich are worse.
MZHemingway	705591196278599681	2016-03-04T03:10:25	Trump’s “Excuse me” is nicely matched by Kelly’s “Standby."
MZHemingway	705590951113175040	2016-03-04T03:09:26	Trump: Trump U got A ratings. Rubio: That’s false. Trump: You’re a liar. And Insults and stuff. Kelly: We looked it up. It was a D-
MZHemingway	705590649341358080	2016-03-04T03:08:14	Rubio’s “that’s false” repetition as Trump says false things about Trump U is good.
MZHemingway	705589910393065472	2016-03-04T03:05:18	Kelly: You change your tune constantly. What’s your core. Trump: I have a very strong core. I’m flexible. Trump voters: Good enough for us!
MZHemingway	705589666007769088	2016-03-04T03:04:20	Keiras_lip_balm I like your good cheer!
MZHemingway	705589420393525249	2016-03-04T03:03:21	AdamMDG I could make the case that Lutherans have always done B.O.
MZHemingway	705589309739393024	2016-03-04T03:02:55	FNC did what Rubio did last debate. Put word out before debate that they wouldn’t hit Trump. Then hit him hard during actual debate.
MZHemingway	705588847548039169	2016-03-04T03:01:05	MZHemingway Why I'm so depressed, even if we are able to stop Trump. Problem is Trump is the symptom, not the disease.
MZHemingway	705588755013308416	2016-03-04T03:00:43	EricaBeeney Heminator …. ….. …. (yes)
MZHemingway	705588569398579200	2016-03-04T02:59:58	Decades of miseducation. Family breakdown. Societal implosion. Self-hatred. Lack of discipline. Irreligion. I give you Election 2016.
MZHemingway	705588004564242433	2016-03-04T02:57:44	jcpent I don’t see a lot of them jumping in with Trump, though, do you?
MZHemingway	705587244984307712	2016-03-04T02:54:43	An order to kill children -- on purpose -- would break the relationship between the military and its civilian commander-in-chief.
MZHemingway	705587439251779584	2016-03-04T02:55:29	That more restrained foreign policy fans are cool with Trump is deeply alarming, after answers like that on killing families.
MZHemingway	705587132556034048	2016-03-04T02:54:16	Why would you do something crazy like using convention rules to stop a man as level-headed and totally non-dictatorial as Donald Trump?
MZHemingway	705586817815318528	2016-03-04T02:53:01	Cruz: Yelling and cursing doesn’t make you a tough guy.
MZHemingway	705586201693016066	2016-03-04T02:50:34	KevJames91 aaronrobinow yes, a good solution is to elect the ultimate con artist who breaks 100% of his promises. Great idea. Let’s do it.
MZHemingway	705585842199212032	2016-03-04T02:49:08	MZHemingway insult/boast/insult/insult. And they're getting lower and lower as he gets more desperate. I can't imagine 8mos of this!

MZHemingway	705585589807144962	2016-03-04T02:48:08	MZHemingway Yes...he also talks about polls!  :)
MZHemingway	705585518252204032	2016-03-04T02:47:51	Nope, he doesn't. I think we're all sick of it. 
MZHemingway	705585467694170112	2016-03-04T02:47:39	MZHemingway I couldn't agree more.
MZHemingway	705585352862359552	2016-03-04T02:47:11	I’m so sick of Trump’s insults. I’m just done. I’m done. I’m DONE. Does he literally have not anything else?

MZHemingway	704817879603134466	2016-03-01T23:57:32	Virginia is proportional, so even if/when Trump wins, Rubio and Cruz can grab delegates. So playing for every voter is worth something.
MZHemingway	704817156727287812	2016-03-01T23:54:39	Of interest to me, by the way, is that the only campaign to contact me in Virginia primary is Rubio.
