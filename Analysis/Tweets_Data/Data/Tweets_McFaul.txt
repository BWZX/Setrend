McFaul	725721665032720384	2016-04-28T16:21:42	Regan called USSR an "evil empire". He wanted to see that regime change.  Come to HooverInst archives &amp; learn more! 
McFaul	725721376384897024	2016-04-28T16:20:34	That may be your view, and its a well-respected approach, but that was NOT Reagan's view. Just read his speeches!   
McFaul	725720985798746112	2016-04-28T16:19:00	On that point, I obviously agree.  
McFaul	725720806542594048	2016-04-28T16:18:18	Last pt: one can support democracy &amp; not support military interventions. Thats my take in Advancing Decmoracy Abroad 
McFaul	725720369785507841	2016-04-28T16:16:34	Reagan didnt go to Berlin and say, 'lets have stability based on common interests.' He said, 'tear down this wall.' 
McFaul	725720112112635904	2016-04-28T16:15:32	BTW, I wrote critically about Reagan's lack of restraint at the time. See this:  
McFaul	725719950535479296	2016-04-28T16:14:54	Cant do pick &amp; choose like that. And Reagan was a regime changer when it came to USSR too. Read Shultz's memoirs.

McFaul	705113888858112000	2016-03-02T19:33:46	I consider honesty to be part of "Authenticity. Integrity" (traits you claim on your twitter feed).    
McFaul	705113373445267456	2016-03-02T19:31:43	Fair enough. Agree to disagree. But for last time, who paid for the trip?  In not answering, you raise questions. 
McFaul	705112735160209409	2016-03-02T19:29:11	&amp; BTW, by appearing in Moscow at RT gala, you by definition "have ties to Russia." 2and2together.  
McFaul	705112267314954240	2016-03-02T19:27:19	So who paid for the trip? Why did Flynn (your father?) agree to appear at an event to celebrate 10 years of RT?  
McFaul	705111653013020672	2016-03-02T19:24:53	BTW, I too have appeared on RT when I was ambassador.  
McFaul	705111379523448833	2016-03-02T19:23:47	Thanks for posting. So Flynn is speaking at RT event. Did RT pay for him to be there? Simple, direct question.  
McFaul	705110874722177024	2016-03-02T19:21:47	AlexeiVolkov1  Sure, Ive been at one of the talks she has given to bankers &amp; there's nothing surprising. read her book &amp; you will know all.

McFaul	705107072916979713	2016-03-02T19:06:41	MGF_83 Someone just tweeted that General Flynn is your father?
McFaul	705106895506317316	2016-03-02T19:05:58	PlenumTriune MGF_83 but at least I know about them. Seems Flynn as former USG official should also disclose.
McFaul	705106743689216000	2016-03-02T19:05:22	PlenumTriune  yep.
McFaul	705106670674796544	2016-03-02T19:05:05	Important distinction. 
McFaul	705106532749279232	2016-03-02T19:04:32	Interesting. Hope he will confirm. 
McFaul	705106197188247552	2016-03-02T19:03:12	aggierican hah!
McFaul	705106068603441152	2016-03-02T19:02:41	Russian government once paid for my hotel expenses (not plane ticket) to attend a Valdai mtg.  
McFaul	705105860897280000	2016-03-02T19:01:52	&amp; for me, nothing wrong with taking honorarium/expenses from govt entities. What is wrong is not being transparent. 
McFaul	705105509511135234	2016-03-02T19:00:28	OK.  Fair point. Agree.  
McFaul	705104499182952448	2016-03-02T18:56:27	Not credible. RT is paid for 100% by Russian govt. Flynn appeared in tux (which he must have packed) at their event. 
McFaul	705104089042956288	2016-03-02T18:54:49	&amp; when I ask you to name one other candidate, you refuse !  Sorry, but intel world &amp; public politics different.  
McFaul	705103580907180032	2016-03-02T18:52:48	My guess is that some voters might be interested in knowing Flynn's affiliation with Russian govt. too.  
McFaul	705103167168471040	2016-03-02T18:51:09	Flynn is advising Trump. Trump could be president. If Flynn is taking money from Russian govt., I want to know.  
McFaul	705102766415355905	2016-03-02T18:49:34	For all Americans who represent the interests of foreign governments in political or lobbying efforts remember this: 
McFaul	705102411556196352	2016-03-02T18:48:09	No obligation to respond to me &amp; I dont know if you work for Flynn. But if so, I'd get a better answer for press. 
McFaul	705101646829752320	2016-03-02T18:45:07	In my view, thats the same, though RT will have a different, convoluted line.  
McFaul	705101224756924416	2016-03-02T18:43:26	Gen. Flynn appears at an event to celebrate Russian propoganda arm and reply is "no comment" as to who paid for it? 
McFaul	705100939544305664	2016-03-02T18:42:18	No comment?  Thats insane ! Sorry, but that doesn't cut it for someone now trying to become a public figure. 
McFaul	705100390925148164	2016-03-02T18:40:07	&amp; to be clear, I have nothing against former USG officials getting paid to do talks.  I do from time to time. 
McFaul	705100121302654977	2016-03-02T18:39:03	So who paid for the trip?  Now I'm really confused. Flynn paid his own expenses to fly to Moscow to attend RT gala?  
McFaul	705080575195885569	2016-03-02T17:21:23	Again, Im just curious who else is talking to him.  Strange that it is not public knowledge.  
McFaul	705080317569142784	2016-03-02T17:20:22	Fair enough. thanks for engaging.  
McFaul	705080093744345089	2016-03-02T17:19:28	Agreed. 
McFaul	705079763614851072	2016-03-02T17:18:10	So why does Rueters only mention Trump?  
McFaul	705079574099415042	2016-03-02T17:17:24	A little more transparency &amp; clarity is needed here. US voters have a right to know.  
McFaul	705078949081034752	2016-03-02T17:14:55	Which other ones is he advising?  
McFaul	705078625259753473	2016-03-02T17:13:38	If Gen. Flynn invited by someone else and then just happened to attend RT gala, thats a different story.  
McFaul	705078283717595136	2016-03-02T17:12:17	&amp; yet, reported that he is a fp advisor for one of leading presidential candidates:  
McFaul	705077698381500416	2016-03-02T17:09:57	Not my question.  Did RT pay him an honorarium and/or expenses? yes or no? (Absence of answer is a de facto yes)   
McFaul	705072164135776256	2016-03-02T16:47:58	Important to clarify. Little odd for advisor to a presidential candidate to accept money from Russian govt. entity. 
McFaul	705069952257040385	2016-03-02T16:39:10	Was he paid (as I am often when I do similar speaking events)?  
McFaul	705069795977211904	2016-03-02T16:38:33	Was General Flynn paid to speak at RT_com event?  Anyone know?  M_Simonyan 
McFaul	705069414870167553	2016-03-02T16:37:02	You are not General Flynn. My bad.

McFaul	699330357984759808	2016-02-15T20:32:04	For my longer take on this debate (hard to do on twitter !) check this out:  
McFaul	699330146017243137	2016-02-15T20:31:14	Was Bush weak too? 
McFaul	699330055151886337	2016-02-15T20:30:52	If your main causal variable for explaining Russian intervention is weak president, how to explain 2008 invasion? 
McFaul	699329108522577923	2016-02-15T20:27:07	We agree on that -- the outcome. We disagree about causes.  
McFaul	699328866947461120	2016-02-15T20:26:09	yes, I agree.  
McFaul	699328657840410624	2016-02-15T20:25:19	Russia had made short-term gains, but risks long-term strategic losses. I agree. But dont know how long, long-run is 
McFaul	699328294622105600	2016-02-15T20:23:52	Wolgadeutscher write your own piece with that title.
McFaul	699328031106605056	2016-02-15T20:22:50	Bush invaded Iraq . Didn't stop Putin from invading Georgia.  
McFaul	699327891612434432	2016-02-15T20:22:16	Had Obama bombed Assad (which I supported), would Putin have NOT invaded Ukraine?  Dont see the logic there.  
McFaul	699327667321982977	2016-02-15T20:21:23	I dont see much relationship between chem weapons deal/redline blink and annexation. 
McFaul	699327419027578880	2016-02-15T20:20:24	Agree that US threat of force was reason for chem weapons deal. I was there in St. Pete when it happened. 
McFaul	699327128655888384	2016-02-15T20:19:14	On debate at MSC2016 about new Cold War , here is my old but still relevant take: Confronting Putin’s Russia 
McFaul	699325564427964417	2016-02-15T20:13:02	I don't buy "Obama is weak" = annexation argument.  I remember 2008, 1981, 1968, 1956.  
McFaul	699325240065691648	2016-02-15T20:11:44	Reset over long before 9/2013.Putin knew there would be no US military response to Ukraine invasion before chem deal 
McFaul	699324744886169601	2016-02-15T20:09:46	How many Russian officials and companies did Bush put on sanctions list after 2008 invasion?  0  
McFaul	699324165350789120	2016-02-15T20:07:28	lrozen I dont, but Ill chew on more and write final assessment in my forthcoming book! Coming soon!
McFaul	699323680279515136	2016-02-15T20:05:32	Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 when Bush was president. 
McFaul	699322716684472320	2016-02-15T20:01:43	Russia invaded Ukraine and started bombing in Syria so perhaps it was self-reflective moment? 
McFaul	699322980652830720	2016-02-15T20:02:46	Yep. Putin +2011 demonstrations = end of Reset.  
McFaul	699322602951561216	2016-02-15T20:01:15	Yes, I  think that's the critical "independent variable" as we say in political science.  
McFaul	699322401767559168	2016-02-15T20:00:28	Actually, it was Rays Hell’s Burger in Arlington.

McFaul	699321018586771456	2016-02-15T19:54:58	lrozen dont think red line blink produced new US-Russia conflict. But yes protests in 2011, not only in Arab world but Moscow, main cause.
McFaul	699318636800974848	2016-02-15T19:45:30	In 2010 at "historic" (his word) Lisbon NATO summit, Medvedev declared Cold War over. In MSC2016, he said Cold War back.  What changed?
McFaul	699316935981268992	2016-02-15T19:38:44	Was nice to run into Medvedev at the MSC2016 . We both remembered fondly his visit to Stanford in 2010. How times have changed since then.
McFaul	699315962693099520	2016-02-15T19:34:52	Pardon me Mr. Lavrov but Assad also is a terrorist. He has killed more innocent civilians in Syria than anyone else.
