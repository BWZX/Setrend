jbarro	725430730919170048	2016-04-27T21:05:38	The theory of merging the HP and Compaq computer businesses was literally that putting two losers together could make a winner.
jbarro	725429933665861633	2016-04-27T21:02:28	Tomorrow tedcruz will have another major announcement: his transition team.
jbarro	725428505756856321	2016-04-27T20:56:48	This Fiorina speech is weirdly discursive, and does not seem at all appealing to the Trump/Cruz swing voter.
jbarro	725428069121421312	2016-04-27T20:55:04	Oops, turns out voters don't care about the constitution.
jbarro	725427913693138946	2016-04-27T20:54:27	In fairness to Fiorina, this year's VP debate format is going to be an improv musical.
jbarro	725427292646707200	2016-04-27T20:51:59	That singing part was weird, but it wasn't as bad a choice as buying Compaq.
jbarro	725426984927432705	2016-04-27T20:50:45	DouthatNYT disagree. If she's on the ticket, POTUS nominee is forced to defend her HP record against Bain 2.0 ads.
jbarro	725426460895379456	2016-04-27T20:48:40	This "Donald is just like Hillary" line is so obviously false, it does not resonate with voters at all. Same with calling Trump "PC police"
jbarro	725425215933657088	2016-04-27T20:43:43	Are they? It doesn't seem to be costing Trump votes. 
jbarro	725424083538681857	2016-04-27T20:39:13	It's true, Carly loves emoticons. She used this one a lot at HP: 👋
jbarro	725422733782310912	2016-04-27T20:33:52	That's Cruz attacking the candidate he'll be endorsing in two months.
jbarro	725422308828041217	2016-04-27T20:32:10	Cruz praises Fiorina for taking on Donald Trump -- at a time when Cruz was saying Trump is "terrific."
jbarro	725421944766627840	2016-04-27T20:30:43	Cruz knows the networks will stay on him, waiting for her. 
jbarro	725421435393433600	2016-04-27T20:28:42	"Fiorina should just hope this only ends up being the second-most disastrous merger of her career."  jbarro
jbarro	725421407493038081	2016-04-27T20:28:35	I don't think Fiorina is a good pick, but she does balance the ticket by being able to smile like a human.
jbarro	725420951651934209	2016-04-27T20:26:47	jneeley78 I repeat the same stump speech at every event.
jbarro	725420506040664070	2016-04-27T20:25:00	Everyone, look under your chairs. Take a look, is there a cartridge under there? You get toner! YOU get toner. EVERYBODY GETS TONER!!!
jbarro	725420101579739136	2016-04-27T20:23:24	TONER FOR EVERYONE!!!!!!!
jbarro	725419227927175170	2016-04-27T20:19:56	“Do they understand why jobs are leaving America?”   Uh, I think Fiorina understands that.
jbarro	725419498979860480	2016-04-27T20:21:00	Again, the key example of thought-through, measured decisionmaking in Carly Fiorina's career was buying Compaq.
jbarro	725418682483089409	2016-04-27T20:17:46	Isn't it presumptuous to announce a running mate when you can't clinch? Isn't the VP up to the delegates? 
jbarro	725415656766758912	2016-04-27T20:05:44	The extraordinary Hastert hearing: a sentencing for an obscure financial crime turns into a forum on sexual abuse. 
jbarro	725414576322428928	2016-04-27T20:01:27	Her attacks generally appeal only to people who already hated the target 
jbarro	725414151481348096	2016-04-27T19:59:45	Maybe Fiorina was an awful CEO, maybe she was average. But shouldn't you be a *great* CEO if you want to be VP? 
jbarro	725413756004503553	2016-04-27T19:58:11	The Fiorina pick is more wishcasting: That voters will care when she points out Trump isn't Mr. Conservative 
jbarro	725413485362987010	2016-04-27T19:57:07	It's time to admit that nobody wants to elect Carly Fiorina to anything. 
jbarro	725410542018547713	2016-04-27T19:45:25	What's your fav Bible verse?   Trump: The one where a gold-digger wronged me and I plucked her eye out and sued her for getting blood on me
jbarro	725410377731850240	2016-04-27T19:44:46	That worked pretty well. 
jbarro	725409627270189056	2016-04-27T19:41:47	oh man I forgot all about this  
jbarro	725392155640999936	2016-04-27T18:32:21	Actually, it's pronounced "'Murica." 
jbarro	725391992923000833	2016-04-27T18:31:42	There are worse running mates Cruz could have picked. Dennis Hastert, for example.
jbarro	725389197624922114	2016-04-27T18:20:36	Too early to be definitive, but really seems like thus far the ROI on a marginal dollar of TV political advertising is lowest its ever been
jbarro	725388782216863748	2016-04-27T18:18:57	I feel like everything in Ivanka's twitter feed was scheduled before her father decided to run for president. 
jbarro	725388191453319168	2016-04-27T18:16:36	This afternoon I'm announcing that thegarance is my running mate in this November's presidential election.
jbarro	725387932304064512	2016-04-27T18:15:34	Ted Cruz really missed his calling as a reality show villain.
jbarro	725387789852938241	2016-04-27T18:15:00	After Trump is nominated, Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina can be a team on The Amazing Race. The team everyone hates.

jbarro	725382812178632704	2016-04-27T17:55:14	Can't believe the David Trone thing didn't work after past precedents like Governor Meg Whitman and Governor Al Checchi.
jbarro	725365533386874880	2016-04-27T16:46:34	This is like the Ahmed Chalabi campaign, but in America 
jbarro	725380466623320065	2016-04-27T17:45:54	jbarro "Heartburn with John Kasich"
jbarro	725380064456617984	2016-04-27T17:44:18	Thought of this as a joke, but now thinking it would actually be successful:  John Kasich Food Network show.
jbarro	725379360065093633	2016-04-27T17:41:30	Why is Cruz tapping Fiorina for VP? Surely Bill Buckner or Pauly Shore or someone similarly successful in his or her field is available.
jbarro	725377705131315200	2016-04-27T17:34:56	This is an apt comparison-- it's like a Dem putting Wendy Davis on the ticket. Except Davis was good at fundraising. 
jbarro	725376493182947331	2016-04-27T17:30:07	Seriously, I'm so excited for the inevitable photos of Kasich going Full Kasich on a wide variety of regional Mexican foods in CA.
jbarro	725375857854914560	2016-04-27T17:27:36	Seriously, they put french fries INSIDE the burrito in San Diego. There's no way Kasich is dropping out before California.
jbarro	725375670541541377	2016-04-27T17:26:51	If Cruz wants Kasich out, he should make sure not to tell him about california burritos at La Posta in San Diego.  
jbarro	725373649876836352	2016-04-27T17:18:49	Everybody is talking about how nobody is talking about the Hastert case.

jbarro	725367722998128642	2016-04-27T16:55:16	Patrick_Gibson well, there's a sentencing range, and they get to consider factors like this within the sentencing range.
jbarro	725367162119028737	2016-04-27T16:53:02	I think 15 months is a fair sentence. Obviously a sentence for molestation would have been longer, but he wasn't tried for that.
jbarro	725366540124733440	2016-04-27T16:50:34	BREAKING: Former House Speaker Dennis Hastert sentenced to 15 months in prison.
jbarro	725365936946044928	2016-04-27T16:48:10	It's amazing that Hastert got away with this for decades because nobody talked, and he only got caught because of a banking law violation.
jbarro	725364711349469184	2016-04-27T16:43:18	Judge reminds courtroom again of extraordinary fact: Hastert called Tom Cross, brother of one of his abuse victims, asking for his support.

jbarro	725361995357237248	2016-04-27T16:32:30	DLind well sure, but that's a valid criticism, even if we're not engaging in the strange sex offender panic that has led to registries.
jbarro	725361159482822656	2016-04-27T16:29:11	DLind that should say it's NOT necessarily forever.
jbarro	725361076867575809	2016-04-27T16:28:51	DLind those seem like signs that he has not repented for or reflected on his actions.
jbarro	725360997679161345	2016-04-27T16:28:33	DLind he also sought a letter of support from the brother of one of his apparent victims.
jbarro	725360860919664640	2016-04-27T16:28:00	DLind It's necessarily forever, but Hastert was quite recently lying to the FBI to cover up his actions.
jbarro	725358842570280962	2016-04-27T16:19:59	“I can tell you, there are nine victims, not five,” Scott Cross said. “I know, I've confirmed there are nine.”

jbarro	722603838847508481	2016-04-20T01:52:35	TheGregoryE in fairness, most of those blocks have no residents at all. The district includes office buildings and a railyard.
jbarro	722603438505357315	2016-04-20T01:50:59	Well, John Kasich won MY precinct with a whopping 56% of the vote. 
jbarro	722602178473521153	2016-04-20T01:45:59	Lol, this is a hilarious exercise in goalpost-moving. Trump needs lion's share of NY delegates, does not need all 95

jbarro	722595684625551360	2016-04-20T01:20:11	The Democratic results so far look a lot more like the pre-election polls than the exits.
jbarro	722595225152143360	2016-04-20T01:18:21	Just spitballing, but maybe sneering at a state's values to curry momentary favor with another state wasn't the best election strategy
jbarro	722593724602150913	2016-04-20T01:12:23	Some weird internals in these exits: Cruz's strongest region is NYC, 10% of "won't vote for Hillary in general" respondents voted for her.
jbarro	722593245558124544	2016-04-20T01:10:29	It'll be weird if this is true that NYC is Cruz's strongest region of NYS. 
jbarro	722592790899609600	2016-04-20T01:08:41	Cautionary note: early wave exit polls have been more favorable to BernieSanders in other close races
jbarro	722592441455525889	2016-04-20T01:07:17	So, likely we will again have a result where Hillary looks weak, and yet a win is even farther from Sanders' grasp than before.
jbarro	722592276292190208	2016-04-20T01:06:38	As a reminder, to be on path to close the pledged delegate gap w/ Hillary, Sanders needs to win NYS by 4 points. 
jbarro	722592046708604928	2016-04-20T01:05:43	A narrow Hillary win isn't in line with the New York polls, but it is in line with the tightening of national polls.
