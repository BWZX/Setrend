mpoindc	706656489025380352	2016-03-07T01:43:30	Literally Bernie and Ted Cruz have the same policy on Ex-Im and supporting U.S. manufacturers. Think about that for a second.
mpoindc	706656040503250944	2016-03-07T01:41:43	Here‚Äôs a fact for you: 90% of the Ex-Im Bank‚Äôs loans support small businesses, including a number of them in Michigan.

mpoindc	706653190649806849	2016-03-07T01:30:24	Sanders‚Äôs argument on the auto bailouts is the same as Romney‚Äôs. Romney said let private finance handle. Everyone forgets none was available
mpoindc	706652714244182017	2016-03-07T01:28:30	Oh man -- Clinton tries to turn Sanders into Mitt Romney on the auto bailout
mpoindc	706652403307679745	2016-03-07T01:27:16	A way more potent line of attack in Michigan than trade and outsourcing. Far more fundamental to the industry.

mpoindc	705816321787695105	2016-03-04T18:04:59	A $15.3 *trillion* tax hike. That's, uh, a lot.

mpoindc	705595894272540672	2016-03-04T03:29:05	Ted Cruz is repeating the same line of crap that simplifies the nature of Detroit's struggles. And he has NO plan to move Detroit forward.

mpoindc	705464650696003584	2016-03-03T18:47:34	Moreover: Free trade didn't wreck Detroit. If anything, industry + labor's protectionism amid global competition meant it failed to adapt
mpoindc	705464414204366848	2016-03-03T18:46:37	I've made the point many times before: Detroit's problems are complex and extend well beyond a typical partisan analysis.
mpoindc	705464215016837120	2016-03-03T18:45:50	One of the dumbest things I've seen. GOP doesn't get a pass for politicizing Detroit, and neither does Bernie.
