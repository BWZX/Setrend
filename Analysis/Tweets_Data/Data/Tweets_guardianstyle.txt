guardianstyle	693252121437696000	2016-01-30T01:59:20	It’s literally the worst thing ever, right?

guardianstyle	693103881438494720	2016-01-29T16:10:17	How about 23 million pounds were stolen? Or £23,230,000.23 were stolen? Rubbish, isn't it. 
guardianstyle	693102861434142720	2016-01-29T16:06:14	Yes. Luckily, they found exactly a million. One more and it might not have worked grammatically. 
guardianstyle	693102418125545473	2016-01-29T16:04:28	So you'd say "one million and twenty-three thousand pounds and fifty-five pence were stolen" would you?" 
guardianstyle	693102092928585728	2016-01-29T16:03:10	Yes.  
guardianstyle	693101323860975616	2016-01-29T16:00:07	That was our point. Millions of people: plural. Millions of pounds: singular, because it's an amount. 
guardianstyle	693101102963806208	2016-01-29T15:59:14	This is hard work. Millions of pounds was stolen – amount. Millions of carrots were stolen – number. 
guardianstyle	693100699295571968	2016-01-29T15:57:38	Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?   
guardianstyle	693089847196672000	2016-01-29T15:14:31	Well so is 125 miles but grammatically it's singular: 125 miles is a long way to go, not are a long way to go. 
guardianstyle	693088366229897216	2016-01-29T15:08:38	OK agreed. So "booties" might be little boots. 
guardianstyle	693088121139896321	2016-01-29T15:07:39	It's an amount, rather than a number: millions of pounds is wasted; millions of people get wasted.

guardianstyle	693063593688956929	2016-01-29T13:30:11	We agree; "booties" are worn by babies. "Booty" is what you shake, unless you're a pirate, and is a non-count noun.

guardianstyle	692708382713708544	2016-01-28T13:58:42	Well, people say they monkey around – but they're too busy singing to put anybody down. 
guardianstyle	692636349472595968	2016-01-28T09:12:28	Very much? 
guardianstyle	692636125517733888	2016-01-28T09:11:35	Yep. It seems to come very naturally to native English speakers: no one would say: how much kisses will you give me? 
guardianstyle	692634739862274048	2016-01-28T09:06:05	Yes. How much money? How many coins? How much love? How many kisses? This is getting quite poetic and it's only 9am.

guardianstyle	692283128388395008	2016-01-27T09:48:54	Then you can use "on the cusp" not because it sounds good but because it is a subtle and nuanced expression. 
guardianstyle	692283023983779840	2016-01-27T09:48:29	If you want to say you are on the verge or brink of something, then why not say so? 
guardianstyle	692282773906800640	2016-01-27T09:47:29	We just think professional journalists should avoid lazy cliches and try to write in a subtle and nuanced way ..
