Lin_Manuel	693836460429033473	2016-01-31T16:41:17	I've spent a lot of time alone and a lot of time in front of others. They both feel like home. Acting's less lonely. 
Lin_Manuel	693833066624729088	2016-01-31T16:27:48	Clever, but I like a consistent hashtag, if it's all the same to you.  
Lin_Manuel	693831683968274432	2016-01-31T16:22:18	I actually find that the structure of knowing I have a show at night forces me to organize my day better.  
Lin_Manuel	693831141573443584	2016-01-31T16:20:09	That Would Be Enough-intensely personal, all at once.  Piragua took like 15 minutes. Maybe the fastest I've written.

Lin_Manuel	693830063398215680	2016-01-31T16:15:52	No that is absolutely my big pun love letter. Pretty much that whole first verse is.  
Lin_Manuel	693829820514451462	2016-01-31T16:14:54	Which job? Not being glib, writing and performing have a lot in common but different rewards.  
Lin_Manuel	693829323975979008	2016-01-31T16:12:56	BlaineQuartz huh?
Lin_Manuel	693828702996660225	2016-01-31T16:10:28	I like to share but I can't give you everything.  
Lin_Manuel	693828417049985024	2016-01-31T16:09:19	Great minds, Nathanson.  Also: "I'd rather skip the pleasant trees, let's go." Gif that.  
Lin_Manuel	693827973590433794	2016-01-31T16:07:34	Are you quizzing me or did we not do a good job explaining? He drives a livery cab.  
Lin_Manuel	693827489660039169	2016-01-31T16:05:38	I learned that from drunkhistory. JoeLoTruglio plays Adams. It's great.  
Lin_Manuel	693827240740655104	2016-01-31T16:04:39	Step away when you're not.  Find another way.  Getting good is the process of finding lots of ways into the work.

Lin_Manuel	693826067468042240	2016-01-31T15:59:59	Didn't ignore it, had to cut it for time. It landed on our act break. Cut lyrics alluding to it in the upcoming book 
Lin_Manuel	693786230450999296	2016-01-31T13:21:41	you'll just have to read the book in April. I get into chickaplao in there.

Lin_Manuel	693785656779264001	2016-01-31T13:19:25	Just seemed like the best way to do it.  
Lin_Manuel	693784952119398400	2016-01-31T13:16:37	I just tried and got a look from the flight attendant. But yes.  
Lin_Manuel	693784549550100480	2016-01-31T13:15:01	Just love me some Genesis. And lots of moods in one song.

Lin_Manuel	693783677021655040	2016-01-31T13:11:33	It's already started, I hear stories about it on here all the time. Grateful.  
Lin_Manuel	693783054448463872	2016-01-31T13:09:04	As soon as the wheels go up. That's why I've had no coffee.  
Lin_Manuel	693782771676876800	2016-01-31T13:07:57	Very very very. I think Tommy's about to set the bar for live TV musicals absurdly high.  
Lin_Manuel	693782564662853632	2016-01-31T13:07:07	Claw machines. I can empty them.  My depth perception is just f*cking ridiculous.  
Lin_Manuel	693782313285611520	2016-01-31T13:06:07	Exactly like Kevin Rosario.  
Lin_Manuel	693782213192781824	2016-01-31T13:05:44	I played them all first, wrote down what they had to say, and here's where I landed.  
Lin_Manuel	693782067524571137	2016-01-31T13:05:09	No but she did once FaceTime sing to him while he ate an apple as I sat thinking "oh kid you have no idea.."

Lin_Manuel	693781378182287360	2016-01-31T13:02:25	He liked it.  We talked hip-hop references for a long time--he caught one I didn't even realize I did.  
Lin_Manuel	693781151614398464	2016-01-31T13:01:31	Yeah but last nights was my newest. It'll have to wait til I get home.

Lin_Manuel	693780444236619777	2016-01-31T12:58:42	The superstition applies to naming The Play, not the character. So I'm fine.  
Lin_Manuel	693780207921139712	2016-01-31T12:57:46	It is going well.  I played a new tune for my wife and she got teary and she's the toughest. So you guys are dead.
