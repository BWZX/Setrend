stevekovach	724621177138851840	2016-04-25T15:28:46	jwherrman And The Verge is not a new news outlet
stevekovach	724621118724816896	2016-04-25T15:28:32	jwherrman As in, links back to verge dot com, not FB Instant articles. Look at the CB page and click. Takes you right back to Verge
stevekovach	724620205410947072	2016-04-25T15:24:54	jwherrman I define it as something that doesn't kick back to verge dot com.
stevekovach	724619932785344512	2016-04-25T15:23:49	jwherrman Sort of! But definitely not a new news outlet.
stevekovach	724619630090792960	2016-04-25T15:22:37	jwherrman 
stevekovach	724619384304635904	2016-04-25T15:21:38	jwherrman Like, yes, they're publishing some native FB videos and doing live and whatever. But it's another door back to Verge
stevekovach	724619256663519232	2016-04-25T15:21:08	jwherrman I'm saying this is not a new news outlet.
stevekovach	724618889959710720	2016-04-25T15:19:40	jwherrman so far I'm only seeing links to verge dot com stories
stevekovach	724618758581567488	2016-04-25T15:19:09	jwherrman so it's social only?
stevekovach	724618623898247169	2016-04-25T15:18:37	jwherrman Tasty is social only. This isn't. Looks like another door back to verge dot com.

stevekovach	724618309585526785	2016-04-25T15:17:22	jwherrman right, but it's more like the "tl;dr" section they have than a new news outlet
stevekovach	724618171433541632	2016-04-25T15:16:49	jwherrman
stevekovach	724617930281984000	2016-04-25T15:15:51	jwherrman thisisinsider launched as a new news outlet on social only. That is a totally new thing, for example.
stevekovach	724617825004994562	2016-04-25T15:15:26	jwherrman Right, but seems wrong to call it a new news outlet when everything lives on verge dot com
stevekovach	724617284325613568	2016-04-25T15:13:17	jwherrman I don't think it's a new news outlet? It seems like a new section on Verge that also has its own FB page.
