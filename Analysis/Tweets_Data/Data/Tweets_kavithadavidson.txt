kavithadavidson	714832658401009664	2016-03-29T15:12:41	The NFL letter to NYTSports is written for an audience of three people: the appeals judges on the concussion lawsuit settlement. That's it
kavithadavidson	714832865847021568	2016-03-29T15:13:30	Federal judges don't read VICESports and maybe aren't even super aware of OTLonESPN - but they sure as hell read A1 of nytimes
kavithadavidson	714870836453380096	2016-03-29T17:44:23	danengber And almost every subsequent study has used that primary data set to draw conclusions that are clearly faulty.
kavithadavidson	714870214047973377	2016-03-29T17:41:55	danengber It's also about the particular teams/names left out of the data. High-profile players who said they retired bc of concussions.
kavithadavidson	714870042073161729	2016-03-29T17:41:14	danengber Well, for one, the '96-'01 data is used as a baseline for future studies to compare inc/dec in conc. rate 
kavithadavidson	714868638461857793	2016-03-29T17:35:39	exify Oh god older fans are the worst about this, too
kavithadavidson	714868340582400000	2016-03-29T17:34:28	prof_goldberg That's why we separate them. NFL's defense right now is 75% about Big Tobacco. Lets them distract from addressing data claims
kavithadavidson	714867326655545344	2016-03-29T17:30:26	prof_goldberg bc that's data the NFL still touts
kavithadavidson	714867251707559936	2016-03-29T17:30:09	prof_goldberg I don't think they're beside the point -- I think at this point, it's more important to highlight the 100 omitted concussions
kavithadavidson	714866664446287873	2016-03-29T17:27:49	exify Like, just because I don't know who recorded the last out at Ebbets Field does not mean I don't know sports.

kavithadavidson	714865870468722688	2016-03-29T17:24:39	prof_goldberg As it stands, you have one piece that should've been two: One major conspiratorial revelation, and another broader context
kavithadavidson	714865711781437441	2016-03-29T17:24:01	prof_goldberg This is how journalism works. Separate articles for each aspect of a story that are all intertwined.
kavithadavidson	714865485121261568	2016-03-29T17:23:07	prof_goldberg  ...that could have then examined how other industries have followed the same script.
kavithadavidson	714865254761672704	2016-03-29T17:22:12	prof_goldberg Again, I'm not denying anything you're saying. I'm saying that should have been a separate article.
kavithadavidson	714863315579703296	2016-03-29T17:14:30	prof_goldberg I've written about NFL using Big Tobacco strategies:   It's important but not the main focus.
kavithadavidson	714863075040559104	2016-03-29T17:13:33	prof_goldberg From a strategy standpoint, 100 concussions omitted should have been the focus. Big Tobacco  connex just serves to distract.
