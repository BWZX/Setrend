_MissVP	715036867301928961	2016-03-30T04:44:08	thatgirlhas Powerful, mama. Your words and you. Love you.
_MissVP	715035316118282240	2016-03-30T04:37:58	Rising above is saying I care enough about my own well being that I'm not going to allow others to trigger me into a negative place.
_MissVP	715034713812045826	2016-03-30T04:35:35	Rising above or transcending an experience is not the same as being a doormat, having no boundaries and letting others walk all over you.
_MissVP	715033809285222402	2016-03-30T04:31:59	When someone hurts you and instead of judging them you are able to offer compassion, indicates being in a heightened state of self mastery.
_MissVP	715036450266488832	2016-03-30T04:42:29	GregShahade So what if you were? I certainly was 5 years ago... If we stayed the same we would be painfully boring and probably stifled.
_MissVP	715035684587876352	2016-03-30T04:39:26	GregShahade What will you think when you're 50? ;)
_MissVP	715035463749345283	2016-03-30T04:38:33	"Let your heart guide you... But listen closely, because it whispers."  💜
_MissVP	715035269968371712	2016-03-30T04:37:47	Write it down, even if for a minute. Write it down, even if you burn it after.
_MissVP	715035007748808705	2016-03-30T04:36:45	But it takes deep honesty to gain that intimate knowledge of oneself; lest you go through life pushing away who you truly are in your heart.
_MissVP	715034642592751616	2016-03-30T04:35:18	Not to say a person cannot listen openly without judgement. Of course they can. My point is that no one knows you better than yourself.
_MissVP	715034492210122753	2016-03-30T04:34:42	...versus trying to prove or show to another that change, one who has perhaps attempted to categorise you based on one candid conversation.
_MissVP	715034260416163840	2016-03-30T04:33:47	Then you can look back and see your own growth and change, and continue to grow in strength and self-determinism...
_MissVP	715033685481955328	2016-03-30T04:31:29	Keep writing until you get there. Wherever "there" is inside of you. You'll know when you do. :)
_MissVP	715033490765561856	2016-03-30T04:30:43	So who better to know and analyse our innermost thoughts, than ourselves?   Write it down.
_MissVP	715033316412551169	2016-03-30T04:30:01	We're all bound by our own lenses: upbringing, personal experience, outlook, goals, intentions. An objective viewpoint is impossible.
_MissVP	715032983477100544	2016-03-30T04:28:42	So often the purging of emotions or ideas to another person doesn't bring about the desired release because the hearer is unable to listen.
_MissVP	715032749736861696	2016-03-30T04:27:46	The act of penning thought to paper is deeply cathartic; it affords you the unique opportunity of reviewing your thoughts at a later date.
_MissVP	715027933124042757	2016-03-30T04:08:38	A journal is always waiting when no other person is there to truly hear what you most need to say.
