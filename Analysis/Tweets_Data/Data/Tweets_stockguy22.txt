stockguy22	715914110572040192	2016-04-01T14:49:59	Notice the disconnect from oil   Markets not far off the recent highs especially since Yellen talk while oil has dipped $5 ($42 to $37)
stockguy22	715911280616423424	2016-04-01T14:38:44	quick 5min spike on futures and markets SPY —  oil still flat at $37 area.. rig counts @ 1pmEST today if moves again
stockguy22	715909406836305920	2016-04-01T14:31:18	glad was cautious &amp; so far was right decision to lock up some of the easy oil profits on XOM CVX COP &amp; RSSP profits a few weeks ago
stockguy22	715907843807907841	2016-04-01T14:25:05	oil back in the $34-$38 range ( 37 doesn't seem it wants to follow thru yet ) .. notice how $40-$42+ was key resistance on oil
stockguy22	715906466343952384	2016-04-01T14:19:37	that was strong push past morning lows on futures and SPY .. back to key 205+ on SPY   oil weak but tiny bounce 
stockguy22	715905503113711617	2016-04-01T14:15:47	i remember other day one analyst thought $320 another thought $120 targets.. .lol TSLA - high short interest is helping the push orix18
stockguy22	715897937767886848	2016-04-01T13:45:43	VRX pushing higher here — even after yesterday’s Moody’s downgrade .. coming close to $27 — that $26+ held well yesterday
stockguy22	715897509344845824	2016-04-01T13:44:01	Was reading this a/m that TSLA has highest short interest since the 2010 IPO ..32M shares so that’s helping 
stockguy22	715896853527728128	2016-04-01T13:41:25	TSLA one of the few stocks up this a/m after the strong pre-order # ’s yesterday on the TeslaModel3 ..  $241+ but high was $247.90

stockguy22	715754174961549317	2016-04-01T04:14:28	In total think they wanted 500k Tesla cars sold by 2020 so 115k pre-orders is very impressive in 24 hrs TeslaModel3 TSLA stocktrader300

stockguy22	715706318825385984	2016-04-01T01:04:18	thanks CapCube at least looks like that downgrade from Moody’s was priced in .. no surprise tho since debt is biggest concern / $26+ held
stockguy22	715613393529528320	2016-03-31T18:55:03	heading out for appointment — won’t be back into the close so have a great evening ! .. tweet you Friday
stockguy22	715612869396664320	2016-03-31T18:52:58	$205 key area again to watch on SPY .. we did say 205-210 would be the extended push but now watch closely if we dip sub 205 again
stockguy22	715612413807226880	2016-03-31T18:51:09	futures faded into 3pmEST  Thought we looked toppy   oil also dropped back to that $38.20 area again 
stockguy22	715593559232135168	2016-03-31T17:36:14	still think we are toppy on both the daily and intraday charts overall ..
stockguy22	715593419377229829	2016-03-31T17:35:40	futures dipping again thru lunch time  &amp; SPY oil going back up .. hmm odd action today but it is Month end so .. 
stockguy22	715589810908430340	2016-03-31T17:21:20	oil had dipped from near $39 to low $38.20 ..now bounced a bit to 38.50+
stockguy22	715574146231574528	2016-03-31T16:19:05	he’s definitely going thru a rough patch but smart guy-  I had just re-read an old article I saved on Ackman orix18 
stockguy22	715572222027501569	2016-03-31T16:11:27	nice JAZZ hit ALERT over $130 ..really nice move the past 3 days — but key resistance as i mentioned earlier on that chart i posted
stockguy22	715568639127248896	2016-03-31T15:57:12	means Ackman et all  won’t be able to refinance properties to add more VRX down here  ..maybe a good thing — buzz339  back to $27 now
stockguy22	715568261535019009	2016-03-31T15:55:42	seems to have held just under the March 21st lows.. —not a bad thing that news Buzz- normal due to the Annual Report delay VRX buzz339
stockguy22	715567383704895488	2016-03-31T15:52:13	thanks buzz339  We noticed it was weaker than normal earlier and didn’t realize why VRX 
stockguy22	715566834330820608	2016-03-31T15:50:02	If trading biotechs with no sales &amp; lot of losses you have to be aware of news, offerings, FDA, Trials—too much to watch IMO tradingnube
stockguy22	715566104282800128	2016-03-31T15:47:08	no problem..  hope that was helpful  
stockguy22	715565558821949440	2016-03-31T15:44:58	here’s a chart on JAZZ that i sent to members earlier - notice its an easier chart to read w/ tweezers tradingnube 
stockguy22	715565064128958464	2016-03-31T15:43:00	if you look at one like JAZZ that has growing sales &amp; profits its an easier biotech IMO - even tho near resistance here tradingnube
stockguy22	715564610917699584	2016-03-31T15:41:12	if they can’t by next year than they will likely do another offering &amp; usually not good sign-so watch cash burn rate &amp; pipeline tradingnube
stockguy22	715564285238358016	2016-03-31T15:39:54	as of Dec 31st they had $600M+ in investments/cash &amp; they are burning thru $40-$88M per Q so they need Phase2 or 3 one to work tradingnube
stockguy22	715563550299783168	2016-03-31T15:36:59	on the bright side of ICPT they did do a huge 2ndary offering last year so  they can burn cash for a while  longer tradingnube
stockguy22	715563076674781184	2016-03-31T15:35:06	I don’t follow ICPT but very little sales / tons of losses - typical biotech that will need news or FDA approval to move more tradingnube
stockguy22	715559483674607616	2016-03-31T15:20:50	if TASR can pop key $20 then there is up to 10% approx more upside to that 200day sma .. that would be nice sell point but I may scale out
stockguy22	715559129641783297	2016-03-31T15:19:25	TASR $19.75 alert .. that key $20 is what i’ll be watching but nice to be sitting on a profit of 8.7% before a major key Resistance zone

stockguy22	695714977383084032	2016-02-05T21:05:51	usually after big drops like LNKD they make for good intraday bounce plays past 10am which it &amp; DATA did today naomihn2000 Demech_Flint

stockguy22	695710538823835650	2016-02-05T20:48:12	only way we keep having these type of wipeouts is if we get recession &amp;/or 2008 type drop ..if not we bounce back strong again Demech_Flint
stockguy22	695710342303899648	2016-02-05T20:47:25	definitely excessive panic on LNKD but will watch it closely next week and may even do a call options spread play or swing  Demech_Flint
stockguy22	695708473313660928	2016-02-05T20:40:00	what a disaster today on tech and biotechs .. don’t think we’ve seen such ugly day with such large % drops .. VRX continues to hold up ok
stockguy22	695664196315435012	2016-02-05T17:44:03	futures &amp; SPY holding up well thru lunch time .. see past 1-2pm if shift or bounce oil less volatile for a Fri. 
stockguy22	695659161896534016	2016-02-05T17:24:03	good dip on DATA LNKD  .. initially past 10am that was excellent bounce on both .. they faded back past 11am — if futures bounce may help
stockguy22	695657857157562368	2016-02-05T17:18:52	I see what you mean but understand in most cases that’s not an issue except those we discussed riabuzz1
stockguy22	695657646419021824	2016-02-05T17:18:02	riabuzz1 that’s usually more of an issue with those "No sales /Tons of losses Biotechs" where they just burn thru cash &amp; must do offerings
stockguy22	695655000668839937	2016-02-05T17:07:31	its good that you have learned fundamentals but still has to match your trading style or you will have difficulty IMO riabuzz1
stockguy22	695643810148323328	2016-02-05T16:23:03	riabuzz1 if u remember that’s how we traded EBAY well ahead of PYPL spinoff .. different co’s but plan was to hold/trade it into spinoff
stockguy22	695643246412877826	2016-02-05T16:20:49	hope those notes help on SVU but fine tune your plan &amp; will make it easier -  riabuzz1
stockguy22	695642408093093888	2016-02-05T16:17:29	riabuzz1 in the case of SVU i think its a longer term swing type play not a 5-10day swing and based on a catalyst of spinoff in future IMO
stockguy22	695641492455583744	2016-02-05T16:13:50	riabuzz1 problem is why would u limit yourself to 5-10 days ? is there a catalyst to move the stock by then ? if doesn’t move u sell ?
stockguy22	695640505108054016	2016-02-05T16:09:55	riabuzz1 when i use to day-trade... I rarely looked at fundamentals —  the longer you plan to hold then fundamentals become very important
stockguy22	695639926013087745	2016-02-05T16:07:37	riabuzz1 generally for daytrades and short term swing trades u should rely mostly on chart reads &amp; less on fundamentals IMO
stockguy22	695639499951497220	2016-02-05T16:05:55	riabuzz1 big issue when you have a change of CEO is takes time (6month-1yr+)  to start to incorporate new strategies and visions &amp; why flat
stockguy22	695638996383330308	2016-02-05T16:03:55	riabuzz1 other guy could not turn SVU around &amp; maybe this new CEO will since that’s his expertise on Mergers &amp; Acquisitions..makes sense?
stockguy22	695638718686879744	2016-02-05T16:02:49	riabuzz1 renegotiated some of their debt  New SVU CEO info 1)   2) 
stockguy22	695637445350707203	2016-02-05T15:57:45	riabuzz1 read about the new CEO if u plan to trade SVU - he’s a M&amp;A specialist so his #1 strategy will probably be a spinoff to raise cash
stockguy22	695637065493573636	2016-02-05T15:56:15	riabuzz1 growth &amp; debt been key concern for SVU for some time now &amp; why the stock has tanked so much .. but with this new CEO may change
stockguy22	695635719117762560	2016-02-05T15:50:54	riabuzz1 by doing the spinoff they will hopefully unlock some $ and value to pay down debt ..that’s why mentioned that SVU
stockguy22	695635041922260992	2016-02-05T15:48:12	riabuzz1 new CEO starts today @ SVU &amp; they're planning to spinoff SaveALot so possible value but may take a while ..watch if $4.60 breaks
stockguy22	695633720263503872	2016-02-05T15:42:57	riabuzz1 we actually had considered SVU since risk-reward on $4+ base is very good but growth issues ..tho spinoff could be good catalyst
stockguy22	695630398571859968	2016-02-05T15:29:45	nice DATA LNKD bounces off lows and past 10amEST .. we were discussing them this a/m in chat — perfect bounce patterns formed

stockguy22	695306997235847168	2016-02-04T18:04:40	After the oil push Fri/Mon we dipped but as I tweeted $30 zone would be key support to watch &amp; held well Tues/Wed
