InvestorsLive	717903100422520832	2016-04-07T02:33:31	Those that tell people that fundamentals is all that matter is why we have squeezes like DRWI it's not that easy I wish it was.
InvestorsLive	717902085220642817	2016-04-07T02:29:29	Yes fundamentals matter in long run but as you'll learn a lot can happen from point A to Z in the short run. Time not always on your side.
InvestorsLive	717900828544094208	2016-04-07T02:24:30	Agree buyers at this level who hold are sheep but DRWI was not natural move. It was fueled by short cover (early shorts).
InvestorsLive	717900504651669505	2016-04-07T02:23:12	Someone sent me tweet. One bashes DRWI at $3 for s/s then proceeds to delete tweet Stock more than triples w/ in 3 days- calls folks sheep.

InvestorsLive	717834136380121088	2016-04-06T21:59:29	Last report by KerrisdaleCap was at 9:27AM hoping they spill coffee on their keyboard tomorrow causing 10 min delay 
InvestorsLive	717832928789721089	2016-04-06T21:54:41	NeelNY they are all separate connected to one PC - stand is what it came with
InvestorsLive	717832219323154432	2016-04-06T21:51:52	Reason I blamed my monitors is because I had SM and WLL on radar each day past 2-3 days and tried to find a trade on them failed
InvestorsLive	717831909506678784	2016-04-06T21:50:38	But absolutely love my set up, glad I did it still fine-tuning what goes where and how I watch it. Will complete a blog on it soon.
InvestorsLive	717831578123112448	2016-04-06T21:49:19	Good news is the market is great right now, each day there is a gift for us. ENDP was today's. Just do the right thing when wrong or sized.
InvestorsLive	717831358857486336	2016-04-06T21:48:27	It's never an issue for me but I had about 3-4 days in a row that had it all back but over stayed on the "riskier" names and turns to losers
InvestorsLive	717831188027740160	2016-04-06T21:47:46	So although I blamed the set up it's really coming off an insane run, had a loss on NUGT 1.5 weeks ago and then "gotta get back" mentality
InvestorsLive	717830697134735361	2016-04-06T21:45:49	ENDP was perfect set up right reasons but LEU SKYS DRWI GNCA style moves -- those huge $1 + squeezes I should be selling not "waiting"
InvestorsLive	717830495254478848	2016-04-06T21:45:01	Patience is a wonderful thing and also a big annoyance - my patience on riskier names has been the problem.
InvestorsLive	717830150814089216	2016-04-06T21:43:39	I can blame the set up but I haven't been taking wins and turning them to losses. Been compounding dumbness past 5-7 trading days.
InvestorsLive	717829832323809281	2016-04-06T21:42:23	Have traded poorly since new set up b/c I can watch everything -- TOO MUCH so using extra spots for TweetDeck GMail etc
InvestorsLive	717829705743867904	2016-04-06T21:41:53	Quite honestly I trade better when I trade less and watch less - monitor set up is great but taking the added charts OFF
InvestorsLive	717829604711514114	2016-04-06T21:41:29	Reworking what I am watching on my monitors. Using more space for OTHER things besides charts.

InvestorsLive	717805017282035712	2016-04-06T20:03:46	I'm glad I did cover WLL and SM on trend reversal - I let them grind me some but covers saved me a lot of $$
InvestorsLive	717804768891125760	2016-04-06T20:02:47	ENDP I held very small over sold most of it in case gapper $30 + range didn't want many over tho
InvestorsLive	717804581783277568	2016-04-06T20:02:03	ENDP was a MAJOR win, hope some of you nailed closed at the HODs from trade idea -- big $$ maker but didn't cover my earlier mistakes

InvestorsLive	717800644829192193	2016-04-06T19:46:24	Thing these newsletters don't understand is they shove all their guys into a break out and create crowded long perfect time to slam it DRWI
InvestorsLive	717799879695863808	2016-04-06T19:43:22	DRWI saw same newsletter drive their peeps into the VWAP three times today and bail - why trade thin names with a newsletter?

InvestorsLive	712698541433614337	2016-03-23T17:52:28	modern_rock problem is when you're too focused on "perfect" "top" entry" you miss the .70-.90 fade after the .30 gap down
InvestorsLive	712698421203873794	2016-03-23T17:51:59	modern_rock OzarkTrades I'd always take stuff off radar on gap down &amp; miss, then see him bank - and light turned on, stop taking off radar
InvestorsLive	712698302416961537	2016-03-23T17:51:31	modern_rock because we want $1-1.50 downside so why would .30 cent gap turn us away? I used to take off radar too - until saw OzarkTrades
InvestorsLive	712698158174838784	2016-03-23T17:50:56	modern_rock yes gapped down but that's the flaw I used to do that too - I'd take them off thinking I "missed" but why are we watching?

InvestorsLive	710824839054024704	2016-03-18T13:47:02	MNK wonder if she wants to test into the $49s today
InvestorsLive	710824064374280192	2016-03-18T13:43:58	CRR this could break down multi dollars today as this circulates 
InvestorsLive	710823733699747840	2016-03-18T13:42:39	VRX can't even hold green today either lol
InvestorsLive	710810588474118144	2016-03-18T12:50:25	Many have been super bearish on CHK FCX WLL trying to find the top each day - wait for trend to shift forget the "top tick"
InvestorsLive	710810381476884481	2016-03-18T12:49:35	So many days these charts look like PERFECT breakouts and then just sell off on the day, OR look like TRASH and close at HIGHS on reversal
InvestorsLive	710810259447812101	2016-03-18T12:49:06	Point being is don't get ultra bullish or ultra bearish just go with the trend on these and have a plan when reverse 
InvestorsLive	710810153143177216	2016-03-18T12:48:41	The thing about oil/gas/energy etc is it looks PERFECT, breakout, squeezish and does but turns on a dime when it wants a day later
InvestorsLive	710810037770440706	2016-03-18T12:48:13	Nice gaps across the board this AM CHK probably lights some fire, SUNE I started dips pre market again 
InvestorsLive	710809342786797568	2016-03-18T12:45:28	CHK wants some blood today, came out swinging so far wonder if this can get going towards $6 will be a main watch

InvestorsLive	707291010456485888	2016-03-08T19:44:52	LEU see how it filtered out and got thin again?
InvestorsLive	707286131637936128	2016-03-08T19:25:29	Then had to filter out all traders who chased it for whatever reason, filter them out, make them sell then pop back on air like its doing
InvestorsLive	707285957792440320	2016-03-08T19:24:47	A great example of FOMO trade and importnat of an entry vs. EXCITEMENT for breakout is $4 break on LEU where it SOLD major into the chase
InvestorsLive	707285544858943488	2016-03-08T19:23:09	LEU on that $4 break went from shorts trapped to longs trapped imo - needs to work out the dumb $3.80-4 FOMO chasers if it has a chance
InvestorsLive	707283731158048769	2016-03-08T19:15:56	Killer trade elkwood66 on the LEU short off the $4 stuff move - great call in chat well done bro !!

InvestorsLive	702170108374949891	2016-02-23T16:36:14	Reason I mention as I believe the 'bid' was nothing more than a slow and steady cover once buyins end, sleep well 
InvestorsLive	702169962434187264	2016-02-23T16:35:39	In my opinion the circles were buy ins on this name since borrows getting thin NHTC (note the vol)

InvestorsLive	697809921061081088	2016-02-11T15:50:24	INO nice move so far today on much less volume than the first time
InvestorsLive	697809025732370432	2016-02-11T15:46:51	But a main watch here if SPY can hold on here and move back towards $183 mid day trend higher we'll see it sell off imo - key spots for me
InvestorsLive	697808879858671616	2016-02-11T15:46:16	Again - Gold is nothing to step in front of just something to watch and then react - b/c if it doesn't fail next leg is near by
