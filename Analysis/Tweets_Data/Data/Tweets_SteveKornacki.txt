SteveKornacki	722611164052590592	2016-04-20T02:21:41	No. Closest is the 12th (Upper East Side), where he leads Kasich by 175 votes with 82% in 
SteveKornacki	722610555702374400	2016-04-20T02:19:16	Looks like this may have been a reporting error -- Board of Elections site just restored a 12-point Trump lead with 86% in
SteveKornacki	722609801205833728	2016-04-20T02:16:16	Meanwhile, Kasich has suddenly pulled ahead in the 10th District (Jerry Nadler) -- with 48% (86% in)

SteveKornacki	722605668906188801	2016-04-20T01:59:51	At the moment, Trump would win 92 of the 95 delegates statewide (if AP count is accurate)
SteveKornacki	722605203980185602	2016-04-20T01:58:00	80% of CD-12 in: Trump 45, Kasich 43%. Delegate split would be 2-1 Trump if it holds, 2-1 Kasich if he catches Trump.

SteveKornacki	720825372959322113	2016-04-15T04:05:35	SteveKornacki there's a PolitiFact estimate of the caucus raw vote 
SteveKornacki	720819432130494464	2016-04-15T03:41:59	Also: while caucus "delegate equivalents" prob hurt Sanders popular vote calculations, Clinton could argue entire caucus system hurts her
SteveKornacki	720818892638154753	2016-04-15T03:39:50	But the bigger question is: Why should only states your party is likely to win in the fall determine a nominee?
SteveKornacki	720818443642093568	2016-04-15T03:38:03	(Note that popular vote numbers aren't precise because some caucuses use delegate equivalents instead of recording votes)
SteveKornacki	720817499407822849	2016-04-15T03:34:18	If you *only* counted blue states (voted for Obama twice), the results so far would be: Clinton 5,174,202 (52.9%) Sanders 4,603,832 (47.1%)

SteveKornacki	720809555337330688	2016-04-15T03:02:44	If Sanders wants to dismiss Hillary's red state wins as meaningless, then does that mean the same for his in Utah, Idaho, Wyoming etc?

SteveKornacki	719197055558795264	2016-04-10T16:15:14	mark_greenbaum yep. I mean if it's 20+ points have to think there'd be fear among GOP leaders of reprisal if they all go with Cruz/Kasich
SteveKornacki	719195552286707713	2016-04-10T16:09:16	TedNesi keeps it plausible. I think the keys are then IN and CA - big potential delegate swings from small shifts in votes
SteveKornacki	719194758267170817	2016-04-10T16:06:07	Trump could be sitting on 950 delegates and a 400-delegate lead by the end of this month
SteveKornacki	719193966315507713	2016-04-10T16:02:58	mark_greenbaum they run on the ballot, some (not sure how many) saying they plan to honor statewide vote
SteveKornacki	719193324758900736	2016-04-10T16:00:25	Fox has Trump up big (48-22-20) in PA. Only 17 bound delegates at stake in primary, but signs some of 54 unbound will honor statewide vote.

SteveKornacki	718522115192791040	2016-04-08T19:33:16	This is my segment from Last Call with Carson Daly last night:   
SteveKornacki	718483269646434306	2016-04-08T16:58:54	Progress for Sanders in NY, but if the final margin is anything like this it would be a delegate disaster for him

SteveKornacki	718128517100277760	2016-04-07T17:29:15	The point is Kasich did better in IL (20%) and MI (24%) than WI (14%) - and that his WI collapse helped Cruz 
SteveKornacki	718127039405023232	2016-04-07T17:23:23	I think the biggest risk for Cruz this month is Kasich outperforming him in the Northeast - could revive him enough to be spoiler in Indiana
SteveKornacki	718126231779155969	2016-04-07T17:20:10	Indiana (May 3) is a big wild card in Trump's path to 1,237. Win the state and he'll get 45+ delegates. Lose and he might get single digits.

SteveKornacki	718047646338908160	2016-04-07T12:07:54	I'll change my mind if he underperforms in NY and on 4/26, but right now I still have Trump clearing 1,237 by the end of the primaries.
SteveKornacki	717889445614252032	2016-04-07T01:39:16	debra_nicholson because under that scenario she's win 117 and his margin would be +13

SteveKornacki	715131429315813376	2016-03-30T10:59:53	owillis because I think one critique of "the media" is oversimplified and misses the mark means I reflexively defend "the media"?

SteveKornacki	714839974458171393	2016-03-29T15:41:45	What I was trying to say with the Trump collage I tweeted a while ago: 
SteveKornacki	714825179872890880	2016-03-29T14:42:58	The media totally failed to vet Trump and instead has been providing nothing but fawning, lapdog coverage like this: 
SteveKornacki	714785239181213696	2016-03-29T12:04:15	No, the media didn't create Trump    
SteveKornacki	714654356163993602	2016-03-29T03:24:10	tarathralls in big-state primaries is what I said

SteveKornacki	714469730640338944	2016-03-28T15:10:32	politicswthsoul you're reading it much too closely. My point is: landslide win late in process that doesn't alter daunting delegate math
SteveKornacki	714462231547682816	2016-03-28T14:40:44	politicswthsoul a model? That's not what I'm talking about here at all.
SteveKornacki	714461376412909568	2016-03-28T14:37:20	JasperAvi nope again. Last poll in NY was less than two weeks ago and Clinton was crushing him  
SteveKornacki	714459372752076800	2016-03-28T14:29:23	A good analogue for the Sanders landslides over the weekend   
SteveKornacki	714458586928295936	2016-03-28T14:26:15	JasperAvi he's not. He's getting crushed in polls in NY, NJ, PA and MD - right now that would *add* 200 delegates to her lead
SteveKornacki	714448991350571008	2016-03-28T13:48:08	ellenxp I didn't break down every state for the republicans either
SteveKornacki	714447053514997760	2016-03-28T13:40:25	ellenxp sure I did. He'd need to win about 2/3 of it, as I said
SteveKornacki	714444812661956608	2016-03-28T13:31:31	tallpowerpaul in three *caucus* states. He needs to do that in primaries in places like WI, IN and CA
SteveKornacki	714435857348952064	2016-03-28T12:55:56	On the other hand, it still is nearly impossible to create a scenario where he catches Clinton in pledged delegates, or even gets that close
SteveKornacki	714435696841330688	2016-03-28T12:55:18	On the one hand, Sanders may win 20+ states and 1,800+ delegates -- sums that were totally unthinkable at the start of this campaign...

SteveKornacki	712757037780701184	2016-03-23T21:44:54	Critique the volume of coverage all you want, but I wouldn't say it's had the effect critics seem to think. 
SteveKornacki	712753571004084226	2016-03-23T21:31:08	There are valid critiques, but if "the media" was as uncritical as some say, Trump wouldn't have historically awful general election numbers

SteveKornacki	705842051305381889	2016-03-04T19:47:13	(this is making some generous assumptions for Rubio and Cruz in the other states - want to see what it would take to get an open convention)
SteveKornacki	705841725911212032	2016-03-04T19:45:56	Some rough math for the 4 possible delegate count scenarios after 3/15, with OH and FL as the variables: 
SteveKornacki	705832716231708672	2016-03-04T19:10:07	This is telling R voters that in the end this is like any other primary -- *not* an urgent, existential crisis  
SteveKornacki	705830823631699968	2016-03-04T19:02:36	"Trump will destroy our party and our country and any Republican ticket headed by him wouldn't be worthy of my support  - or yours."
SteveKornacki	705830590923329536	2016-03-04T19:01:41	"Trump's pretty bad and I think we'll lose with him -- but hey, he's still better than Hillary!"    is not the same as....
SteveKornacki	705829691144458240	2016-03-04T18:58:06	...which I think tells R voters that Trump's prospective nomination *isn't* actually something to fight at all costs.
SteveKornacki	705829188150943745	2016-03-04T18:56:06	Rubio and Cruz are trying to sound this alarm, but then also saying, "Actually, I'm fine voting for Trump if he wins."
SteveKornacki	705828843203006468	2016-03-04T18:54:44	It would be an extraordinary and unprecedented thing to pull off, and requires convincing Rs that Trump is so repugnant it has to happen...
SteveKornacki	705828368105795584	2016-03-04T18:52:51	The Never Trumps are trying to stop a guy who's won 10 of 14 contests and to get Rs to vote strategically to produce an open convention...
SteveKornacki	705826881254330368	2016-03-04T18:46:56	Bud Collins was the best   
SteveKornacki	705801964366524417	2016-03-04T17:07:56	jbview That's the point. They're saying it's not so vitally important to stop trump after all- that all that really matters is he's not HRC
SteveKornacki	705787477278269443	2016-03-04T16:10:22	jbview But their case isn't that trump is run of the mill bad. It's that he's uniquely awful in a way that threatens the republic.
SteveKornacki	705777262424104960	2016-03-04T15:29:46	rogernoriegaUSA thanks -- appreciate that
SteveKornacki	705770586459541504	2016-03-04T15:03:15	rogernoriegaUSA but Cruz now being "anyone of those guys" is a *huge* shift in Cruz's status with Romney-types

SteveKornacki	705762920202764288	2016-03-04T14:32:47	A scene no one could have imagined even one year ago: Mitt Romney on Today saying Ted Cruz is one of three people who can "save" the GOP
SteveKornacki	705762173813858304	2016-03-04T14:29:49	Kansas is tough to figure. Johnson County (KC burbs) is filled with Rubio-types. But rural areas are made for Cruz. And Trump leads in poll.
SteveKornacki	705760776196239361	2016-03-04T14:24:16	Even with losses in Florida and Ohio, Trump could *still* be in good shape to win a first ballot majority  
SteveKornacki	705604228195225600	2016-03-04T04:02:12	Problem for Trump's rivals: If he's threat to democracy, buffoon, con artist -- how can they easily say they would vote for him if nominee?

SteveKornacki	705473256409702400	2016-03-03T19:21:46	Since endorsing Trump serious uptick in Christie referring to guys as "Mr."  
SteveKornacki	705434570401955840	2016-03-03T16:48:02	Interesting to consider the stature Romney, a defeated nominee no longer in office, still enjoys. This would be like Michael Dukakis in 1992
SteveKornacki	705432691861286914	2016-03-03T16:40:34	What Trump has done: Mitt Romney just said that Ted Cruz is one of three candidates who should be the Republican presidential nominee.

SteveKornacki	704898528494161920	2016-03-02T05:18:00	Short of sweeping, this has to be what Trump wanted: Rubio fails to push Cruz out, and Cruz actually emerges stronger than Rubio.

SteveKornacki	701455858052554753	2016-02-21T17:18:03	jbview they're also subject to change. Look where they were when he started -- and let's see where they are after a few more wins.
SteveKornacki	701450071561338880	2016-02-21T16:55:04	mark_greenbaum jbview trump's favorable number with R's also outpaces his vote %
SteveKornacki	701446382037688321	2016-02-21T16:40:24	mark_greenbaum jbview I don't buy that anyone who's heard of Trump and not yet for him is somehow off limits to him.
SteveKornacki	701445755895214080	2016-02-21T16:37:55	But with each primary win, Romney improved that head-to-head number and left Gingrich in the dust. If Trump keeps winning, same may happen.
SteveKornacki	701445460570075136	2016-02-21T16:36:44	Yes, Rubio does well when polls reduce it to a one-on-one with Trump. But...the same was true for Newt over Mitt:  
SteveKornacki	701430042732208129	2016-02-21T15:35:28	ldelvalle Morning_Joe I'm not ignoring them. I'm also remembering that  head-to-heads showed Newt thrashing Romney in '12...
SteveKornacki	701428868696117249	2016-02-21T15:30:48	Rubio's campaign really, really reminds me of Mo Udall in '76... 
SteveKornacki	701425725434425346	2016-02-21T15:18:19	Rubio: 70% of Republicans nationally have basically said, 'We're not voting for Donald Trump.'  So are 80% saying they won't vote for Rubio?
SteveKornacki	701279303598743552	2016-02-21T05:36:29	Exactly  
SteveKornacki	701276749221515264	2016-02-21T05:26:20	DrewMTips I'm from Mass. Same thing. I hear all these assumptions of Rubio/Kasich strength but I could see Trump winning by 20+
SteveKornacki	701275031930851328	2016-02-21T05:19:31	The blue states could end up being Trump's strongest. He's doing best with moderates. 
SteveKornacki	701272318824288256	2016-02-21T05:08:44	mark_greenbaum very. And yet seeing all these assumptions of Rubio/Kasich strength
SteveKornacki	701271412556886016	2016-02-21T05:05:08	So where does Rubio win on 3/1? Jeb was barely registering in SEC states and I think MA and VT set up better for Trump than many assume.
SteveKornacki	701269066552635392	2016-02-21T04:55:49	Next up for GOP: Nevada, where Trump leads Rubio by 23 in the RCP average. But give Rubio all of Jeb's support and the gap is ... 20
SteveKornacki	701252143248965633	2016-02-21T03:48:34	If Rubio picks up all Jeb support in Fla, he's only 17 pts behind Trump, based on today's Fla RCP avg
SteveKornacki	701247868716199936	2016-02-21T03:31:35	Projection: Donald Trump has won all 50 South Carolina delegates.
SteveKornacki	701248420288274432	2016-02-21T03:33:46	Trump's pulling voters from across the board and doing best with moderates. I don't buy that Jeb and Kasich both getting out would sink him.
SteveKornacki	701215207956336640	2016-02-21T01:21:48	The general denial I'm still getting from GOP elites about the strong position Trump is in to be their nominee is pretty amazing
SteveKornacki	701246356262776832	2016-02-21T03:25:34	In the four counties that are mostly in SC01, Trump leads Rubio 40,512 to 35,678. That almost surely means Trump swept all 50 delegates.
SteveKornacki	701237066185703425	2016-02-21T02:48:39	The biggest concentrations of putstanding precincts are in York (Rock Hill) and Florence, where Cruz is running ahead of Rubio
SteveKornacki	701235252648398848	2016-02-21T02:41:27	Trump also won Spartanburg solidly, so with the slim Greenville win looks like he'll take the 4th CD.
SteveKornacki	701235078526083073	2016-02-21T02:40:45	99.3% of Greenville now in. Trump 26.8%, Cruz 24.6%, Rubio 24.6%
SteveKornacki	701234317998104576	2016-02-21T02:37:44	Bush dropping out definitely helps Rubio, but it's too simplistic just to add one candidate's support to another's—reality is more complex.
SteveKornacki	701226727167680512	2016-02-21T02:07:34	75% in and Rubio leading Cruz by 3,100 votes for second place
SteveKornacki	701224524377931777	2016-02-21T01:58:49	Trump's right on this. He *will* pick up votes from those who leave. Even if it's not many, it makes catching him harder than assumed.
SteveKornacki	701223777544314881	2016-02-21T01:55:51	With 60% of Greenville County in, it's Trump 26.5%, Rubio 25.1%, Cruz 23.8%.
SteveKornacki	701222217896439808	2016-02-21T01:49:39	It might never have ended this way for Jeb if it hadn't been for Lawton Chiles
SteveKornacki	701221800781320192	2016-02-21T01:48:00	SeanTrende That's true, but I remember when they showed Mitt wouldn't either in '12, then winning fixed things for him...
SteveKornacki	701220798648950784	2016-02-21T01:44:01	Biggest vote-producing county in state and anchor of CD-4. 
SteveKornacki	701220646093721601	2016-02-21T01:43:24	Jeb: "The people of Iowa and NH and SC have spoken and I really respect their decision. So tonight I am suspending my campaign."
SteveKornacki	701220315163136000	2016-02-21T01:42:05	To get all 50 delegates, Trump needs to sweep the 7 CDs. Biggest obstacle looks like the 4th -- Greenville and Spartanburg (Trey Gowdy).
SteveKornacki	701216980343328769	2016-02-21T01:28:50	There's a real possibility Trump will win all 7 congressional districts and all 50 delegates up for grabs in South Carolina
SteveKornacki	701216090500759552	2016-02-21T01:25:18	A thorough win: Trump is leading in Romney's best county in the '12 primary (Beaufort) and has also won Romney's worst county (Union).
SteveKornacki	701214703478054912	2016-02-21T01:19:47	4 small counties 100% in now. All big Newt counties, all for Trump tonight -- not by same margin, but Trump also leading two Mitt counties.
SteveKornacki	701211374484115456	2016-02-21T01:06:34	These results are reinforcing my skepticism at the "Trump will lose once the field thins out" talk. His strength is across the board.
SteveKornacki	701210921390235648	2016-02-21T01:04:46	With 67% in, Trump leads in Beaufort (Hilton Head) -- one of the three SC counties Mitt won in '12 -- 31-28% over Rubio. Cruz back at 17.
SteveKornacki	701209719898292225	2016-02-21T00:59:59	SC starting to look like a bigger margin for Trump than early exits suggested.
SteveKornacki	701208940193906688	2016-02-21T00:56:53	Maybe a bad sign for Cruz: He's only tied w/ Rubio for 2nd with 50% in in Union, an upstate Huck/Cruz county.
SteveKornacki	701203377426976768	2016-02-21T00:34:47	Trump becomes the fourth Republican since 1980 to lose Iowa, then win both NH and SC. The others were Reagan '80, Bush '88 and McCain '08.

SteveKornacki	696357625311662080	2016-02-07T15:39:30	MattDickinson44 which is why the "border advantage" is much more of an MA advantage. MA pols widely known where most people live in NH.

SteveKornacki	694374390671249410	2016-02-02T04:18:50	I think I confused some people with my '92 comparison on-air. I wasn't saying Bill Clinton claimed a literal victory in NH- just a moral one
SteveKornacki	694367770293735424	2016-02-02T03:52:31	My rough math says there are 175 outstanding precincts -- 63 in Sanders counties, 112 in Clinton

SteveKornacki	694364051283927041	2016-02-02T03:37:45	Very rough math: 104 of the 233 outstanding precincts are in counties Sanders is leading. 129 are in Clinton counties.
SteveKornacki	694362206041829380	2016-02-02T03:30:25	Clinton camp claiming victory. They're up slightly now, but I'm seeing at least as many Sanders precincts still out as Clinton.
SteveKornacki	694361091044847617	2016-02-02T03:25:59	The idea of a Rubio surge has been mocked for months, but he has exceeded expectations tonight. Now - will it break the NH logjam?

SteveKornacki	694196192390045696	2016-02-01T16:30:44	De Blasio would probably look better now if he'd just endorsed Sanders  
SteveKornacki	694192750720389120	2016-02-01T16:17:03	I don't think O'Malley ever made a case for why this race needed him 
SteveKornacki	694190553668423681	2016-02-01T16:08:20	Sanders' problem: The 3 college counties (Johnson, Story, Black Hawk) typically account for twice as many participants as actual delegates
SteveKornacki	694163751608664064	2016-02-01T14:21:49	Bad: Bill Clinton got 4th in IA in '92 and still won the nomination!  Good: No one campaigned in IA in '92. The result was meaningless.

SteveKornacki	693987195057668097	2016-02-01T02:40:15	peterdaou Again, Bill Clinton didn't "lose" in any meaningful way. It is far more accurate to say that IA as we know it didn't happen in 92
SteveKornacki	693986322894073856	2016-02-01T02:36:47	In 1992 the non-Harkin candidates skipped Iowa, the media ignored it and almost no one participated. Clinton's "loss" was meaningless.
SteveKornacki	693986008442929152	2016-02-01T02:35:32	zzbar Nope. It was a non-event. No one campaigned or spent money, media ignored it, no one turned out. Means zero.
SteveKornacki	693985583845265412	2016-02-01T02:33:51	Second, '92 doesn't count. It was "essentially uncontested." No one lost.  
SteveKornacki	693985460188684288	2016-02-01T02:33:21	Nope. First, I said no had lost IA and NH to *the same candidate* and won the nomination....

SteveKornacki	693955721617104898	2016-02-01T00:35:11	Key from DMR poll: No sign of a late Rubio surge -- "His support declined during the four days of polling."

SteveKornacki	687314763181854725	2016-01-13T16:46:23	In case you missed it - here's this morning's SteveKornacki interview with RandPaul 
SteveKornacki	687313019748102144	2016-01-13T16:39:28	kelleratlarge Yep, although it was aimed at a core Democratic constituency. But I was thinking more of the Social Security stuff...
SteveKornacki	687308132985475073	2016-01-13T16:20:03	No. I'm saying that polls show the Dem base largely agrees with Sanders on single payer   
SteveKornacki	687307419777667073	2016-01-13T16:17:13	EricKleefeld this is tame compared to what I wanted to do...
SteveKornacki	687306983440003072	2016-01-13T16:15:29	(The Clinton attacks on Tsongas were also very deceptive.)
SteveKornacki	687306696226648064	2016-01-13T16:14:20	I asked Rand Paul if he could support Trump as the GOP nominee: "Yeah, I think it would have to happen."   
SteveKornacki	687304800938098688	2016-01-13T16:06:48	...but the attacks on Tsongas were from the left. They had obvious appeal to the party base. Not necessarily true with this Sanders hit.
SteveKornacki	687304602484649984	2016-01-13T16:06:01	In a way, this is nothing new. Way back in '92, Hillary played a big role in pushing Bill's campaign to attack Paul Tsongas, which worked...
SteveKornacki	687303809710866432	2016-01-13T16:02:52	"This is the kind of attack that not only undermines core Democratic values, but gives aid and comfort to [GOP]." 
SteveKornacki	687303607302094848	2016-01-13T16:02:04	Negative campaigning can obviously be very effective, but the catch with Hillary's attack on Bernie is that she's doing it from the right
SteveKornacki	687301014345641984	2016-01-13T15:51:45	The Clinton camp is basically telling Dems that Bernie will do to ObamaCare exactly what Republicans would do   
SteveKornacki	687103812889264128	2016-01-13T02:48:09	In an NBC poll last month, 34% approved of Obama's handling of ISIS
