jbenton	725515514097766400	2016-04-28T02:42:32	E.g., naming a building Idi Amin College is not an invitation to consider the legacy of poor Ugandan governance 
jbenton	725515257834254336	2016-04-28T02:41:31	When in reality, they are interpreted by roughly everyone as HONORINGS  SaloveyPeter
jbenton	725515124392513536	2016-04-28T02:40:59	The real flaw here is the argument that building names are somehow best seen as invitations to historical inquiry 
jbenton	725514702428770304	2016-04-28T02:39:19	John C. Calhoun was probably one of the 5 or 10 most evil federal politicians in American history 
jbenton	725513997781491712	2016-04-28T02:36:31	One could easily have this slavery “interactive history project” without honoring a dead slaver

jbenton	725512914765910016	2016-04-28T02:32:12	It is folly to assert that acknowledging history must coexist with honoring an evil man 
jbenton	725512274283249664	2016-04-28T02:29:40	The act of naming is coexistent with the act of honoring SaloveyPeter 
jbenton	725512105848377344	2016-04-28T02:29:00	It is the same argument used by Southern white racists to deny renaming or replacement of Confederate monuments 
jbenton	725511914416119808	2016-04-28T02:28:14	I have huge respect for SaloveyPeter, but his explanation re: Calhoun College here is nonsense

jbenton	710836602810015744	2016-03-18T14:33:47	dankennedy_nu The reality is that NPR now has different interests than stations, but stations run NPR. Hard to see that working longterm
jbenton	710836431032336384	2016-03-18T14:33:06	dankennedy_nu But podcasting and mobile apps will have the same impact on local radio whether NPR “wins” or not.
jbenton	710833962248179713	2016-03-18T14:23:17	dankennedy_nu Sure, but newspapers’ decisions around digital were also aligned with their current funding models (print).

jbenton	710656314087702528	2016-03-18T02:37:23	tomcritchlow aschweig mattdennewitz I guess so? I’m not confident in my predix on this point.

jbenton	710655759063904257	2016-03-18T02:35:10	tomcritchlow aschweig mattdennewitz yeah, I remain relatively bearish about AMP adoption, but I could be wrong
jbenton	710655221245059072	2016-03-18T02:33:02	tomcritchlow aschweig mattdennewitz I guess it’s in part that FB/Apple want to live *next* to the web, AMP wants to *replace* the web

jbenton	710654354517323782	2016-03-18T02:29:36	tomcritchlow aschweig mattdennewitz So the loss of webby autonomy feels worse than “hey, build on our platform”
jbenton	710654251324805120	2016-03-18T02:29:11	tomcritchlow aschweig mattdennewitz I think part is w. FB/Apple, you’re blding a new presentation; with AMP, you’re adapting existing one
