IvanTheK	724044076509700096	2016-04-24T01:15:34	BobBrinker it's not like the explicit guarantee mimics a treasury bond, although one might infer from that language an implicit guarantee.
IvanTheK	724043489537826816	2016-04-24T01:13:14	BobBrinker while they both state that deposits are backed by the full faith and credit of the US, that oversimplifies the actual backstop.

IvanTheK	723993833458044929	2016-04-23T21:55:55	guan 34bps DavidSchawel BTW, if the obligation of US is limited to the credit line, then "Full Faith and Credit" seems like a lie.
IvanTheK	723993237137022976	2016-04-23T21:53:33	guan 34bps DavidSchawel Ah, that's what I'm looking for. What's their limit?
IvanTheK	723992580736819200	2016-04-23T21:50:57	guan 34bps DavidSchawel Is that it? No ability for the fund to borrow from govt to cover insurance claims?
IvanTheK	723991903134453761	2016-04-23T21:48:15	34bps DavidSchawel My understanding is that the FDIC backstop is limited. Does the NCUA have a similar limit? 
IvanTheK	723990409953841154	2016-04-23T21:42:19	34bps DavidSchawel I mean it is not an explicitly back stopped US government agency.

IvanTheK	723989856259571712	2016-04-23T21:40:07	34bps DavidSchawel But is that right? Or is it just a *limited* credit backstop from Treasury to the FDIC fund?
IvanTheK	723988905075347456	2016-04-23T21:36:20	DavidSchawel never knew that.
IvanTheK	723987492542775296	2016-04-23T21:30:43	sparksjls The limits are similar. I'm referring to the safety of the fund backing it. FDIC has an "implicit" govt guarantee.
IvanTheK	723986828882251776	2016-04-23T21:28:05	It looks to me like credit union deposit insurance is technically stronger than FDIC bank insurance. Is this right?

IvanTheK	721456155873132548	2016-04-16T21:52:06	mark_dow RobinWigg If that happens then likely the order handling was botched or the venue sucks.
IvanTheK	721455469768876033	2016-04-16T21:49:22	RobinWigg mark_dow That's right. Also, good order handlers now know the latencies, and time the market sweeps to hit at the same time.
IvanTheK	721453069419036672	2016-04-16T21:39:50	mark_dow RobinWigg The problem is, in fragmented markets, part of your order can be seen at one venue before the rest hits other venues.
