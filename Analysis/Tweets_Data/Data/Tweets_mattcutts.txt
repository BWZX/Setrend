mattcutts	718519452006912000	2016-04-08T19:22:41	stubro and that's a natural mental model, because crashplan says they're protecting your "whole digital life."

mattcutts	718515238807547904	2016-04-08T19:05:56	pkedrosky weird that they put dealing with a corner case onto their customers though. They gave me 5 days to sort through 3 old computers.

mattcutts	718512625663942657	2016-04-08T18:55:33	karangoel I'm a big believe in the 1-2-3 backup plan:   But crashplan is shooting themselves in the foot on this.
mattcutts	718512052768104448	2016-04-08T18:53:17	silvano crashplan (when they see the damage to their goodwill/brand) over what should be a minor amount of data in total.
mattcutts	718511887885869061	2016-04-08T18:52:38	silvano The crashplan backup client is good--you can back up to (say) friends' computers.  I'm hoping this policy call is undone.
mattcutts	718511555436937217	2016-04-08T18:51:18	scottclark crashplan the TEXT says "You’re just three simple steps away from protecting your whole digital life." 
mattcutts	718511289438343170	2016-04-08T18:50:15	scottclark crashplan yeah. "CrashPlan is not designed as a data archival service" says the email. But if you go to their web page, then
mattcutts	718511042624512000	2016-04-08T18:49:16	karangoel So crashplan is causing stress and work for us/their customers, but they'll get stuck backing up the same data again. Sheesh.
mattcutts	718510449004707840	2016-04-08T18:46:54	karangoel That's the crazy part--you could download the old backups onto current/connected computers, and then crashplan will back it up.
mattcutts	718510085480157184	2016-04-08T18:45:28	RyanJones Because you moved to a new computer--or a new location--and you didn't want to take the old computer along.
mattcutts	718509580750180352	2016-04-08T18:43:27	nelson agreed. 5 days is not much notification cc crashplan
mattcutts	718508396077383680	2016-04-08T18:38:45	nelson so my wife, who moved to a new computer &amp; trusted crashplan to hold onto that data, has 5 days to deal with 326GB of her data.
mattcutts	718507963699240960	2016-04-08T18:37:02	nelson they just emailed: "this computer hasn't connected to CrashPlan in the last six months. So we're going to purge it in 5 days."
