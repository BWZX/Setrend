shadihamid	723185415964889091	2016-04-21T16:23:33	fdaoulb fair enough. in case it's of interest though and you'd like to hear the full, detailed argument: 
shadihamid	723183160750673920	2016-04-21T16:14:36	laseptiemewilay said "most":) and talking Arab world. largest "secular" parties in Al/Mor don't generally call for separation KarlreMarks
shadihamid	723180644738568193	2016-04-21T16:04:36	KarlreMarks sure, but even most "secular" movements wouldn't advocate for separating religious &amp; political (w- some exceptions in Tunisia)
shadihamid	723179443754143744	2016-04-21T15:59:50	fdaoulb i address this in subsequent tweets
shadihamid	723177933372854272	2016-04-21T15:53:49	KarlreMarks never said it was irrelevant. conversation (and your original tweet) was in reference to separating "religious" &amp; "political"
shadihamid	723176760406237184	2016-04-21T15:49:10	.KarlreMarks Islamic modernists (precursor to Islamists) draw sometimes quite heavily from Enlightenment arguments on "reason" 2/2

shadihamid	723172884433113088	2016-04-21T15:33:46	AjdinDautovic didn't say that. just said that the presumption that the "religious" and "Political" are separate categories is problematic

shadihamid	723165220768612353	2016-04-21T15:03:19	donadeseu and, sure, Enlightenment has been synonymous with "modernity," which might be precisely the issue KarlreMarks

shadihamid	723160212815761408	2016-04-21T14:43:25	Why should Islam, a different religion, follow the same historical trajectory as Christianity? This is too often simply assumed.

shadihamid	723138911959048192	2016-04-21T13:18:46	Challenging thing, though, is that some of the divides over intervention are "philosophical"

shadihamid	722874682983059456	2016-04-20T19:48:49	antissa sure, never said US should be. but it can and should play leadership role, to mitigate allies acting against our interests/values
shadihamid	722874505442373632	2016-04-20T19:48:07	djpressman nope not at all. stepping back would apply to: syria, libya, egypt, saudi, bahrain (and entire regional strategy)
shadihamid	722872040361865216	2016-04-20T19:38:19	.djpressman Obama, somehow, has managed the worst of both worlds: stepping back from region while *still* actively supporting dictators
shadihamid	722870634653454337	2016-04-20T19:32:44	djpressman agree, the gap should be larger, ideally quite a bit larger
shadihamid	722870448602546178	2016-04-20T19:31:59	YousefMunayyer well, the Saudis definitely don't seem to be realizing their limits. the opposite

shadihamid	722869925727965186	2016-04-20T19:29:55	YousefMunayyer right, but many would argue that Obama's assessment of the limits of US influence are incorrect
shadihamid	722869747436523523	2016-04-20T19:29:12	djpressman didn't say that. just that it's not exactly where the US is. and, in any case, it's contrary to US interests

shadihamid	722853907970428928	2016-04-20T18:26:16	Ideological motivation and even "faith" (correlated to some extent w- party discipline) contribute to this advantage over non-Islamists.
shadihamid	722852856206794752	2016-04-20T18:22:05	Stl_o I'm not sure how being Tunisian has anything to do with whether or not you're aware of what languages MPs speak
shadihamid	722847982757015553	2016-04-20T18:02:43	Another reason Islamists tend to have a 'built-in' advantage in electoral politics: they show up to parliament more. 
shadihamid	722846115372990465	2016-04-20T17:55:18	Stl_o that's not correct. I know quite a few who do KimGuiler

shadihamid	713012667850563585	2016-03-24T14:40:41	Where I somewhat naively ponder whether Ted Cruz is familiar with the classical Islamic tradition on jihad 
shadihamid	713011682436628480	2016-03-24T14:36:46	Should the U.S. designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist group? My thoughts for usnews: 
shadihamid	713004275182530560	2016-03-24T14:07:20	magsmitchell thank you!
shadihamid	712998929688829953	2016-03-24T13:46:06	Extremely important resource and exchange. Islamism politicalislam dialogue 
shadihamid	712998548044976129	2016-03-24T13:44:35	In this long, fascinating essay, a Brotherhood activist offers an insider account, addressing revolution &amp; violence: 
shadihamid	712994463598186496	2016-03-24T13:28:21	GideonResnick my first question is: who is Justin Bartha?
shadihamid	712989579285032960	2016-03-24T13:08:57	My mini-"twitter essay" on why I'm not down with the whole NeverTrump thing. 
shadihamid	712744321997475840	2016-03-23T20:54:23	shadihamid I tend to agree that Cruz is more anti-Muslim (and hence scary) than Trump
shadihamid	712743830131515397	2016-03-23T20:52:25	So, sorry: I'm not on board with this whole NeverTrump thing.
shadihamid	712743617769652224	2016-03-23T20:51:35	My mom called last night after hearing Cruz's remarks on Muslims and she was genuinely scared. She asked me: what if this guy actually wins?
shadihamid	712743049361797120	2016-03-23T20:49:19	If it's between Trump &amp; Cruz, there's now little doubt in my mind. Trump at least flip flops. Cruz, however, seems to actually believe it.
shadihamid	712741918514548737	2016-03-23T20:44:50	That so many mainstream politicians &amp; pundits would support Cruz shows how mainstream anti-Muslim bigotry has become in GOP circles.
shadihamid	712741044731949057	2016-03-23T20:41:21	We shouldn't forget Cruz's AIPAC speech: It was unhinged, frightening, and quite frankly dangerous. 
shadihamid	712740254923538432	2016-03-23T20:38:13	The NeverTrump movement elides the fact that Ted Cruz may very well be more anti-Muslim and more extreme on foreign policy than Trump.
shadihamid	712725823476932608	2016-03-23T19:40:52	Dav_Jourdan glad that's settled. thanks

shadihamid	712717643560710144	2016-03-23T19:08:22	If we want to understand Islamists and what animates them, then we have to do something simple: talk to them.
shadihamid	712715327684145152	2016-03-23T18:59:10	Our first entries in "Islamists on Islamism" are from Ennahda MP SaidaOunissi and Brotherhood activist AmmarFayed:

shadihamid	712700176452993025	2016-03-23T17:58:58	Very happy to announce our new series where Islamists directly respond to and debate leading scholars of Islamism: 
shadihamid	712694024168148992	2016-03-23T17:34:31	adesnik wow Obama actually said that? I find that sort of incredible (in the not so good way)
shadihamid	712689755922817029	2016-03-23T17:17:33	The_Dailey yes, I love holding back peace

shadihamid	712652195653664769	2016-03-23T14:48:18	I discuss in detail why the "Islam needs a reformation" trope is dangerous in my new book Islamic Exceptionalism. 
shadihamid	712631542397452289	2016-03-23T13:26:14	sabathenomad no, but it tends to peak after terrorist attacks. also, worse now than say a year ago, b/c of Trump-Cruz legitimization
shadihamid	712629900730056705	2016-03-23T13:19:43	Wow. A lot of people who really, really hate Islam and/or Muslims are on Twitter and not particularly shy about expressing said hatred.
shadihamid	712627314731913216	2016-03-23T13:09:26	How are civilians living under ISIS rule affected by airstrikes? Quinn Mecham explores in our BrookingsFP series: 
shadihamid	712626639935578112	2016-03-23T13:06:45	dhnexon sadly, it's pretty much pervasive especially after attacks. Even Obama uses similar rhetoric:  djpressman
shadihamid	712623806590885889	2016-03-23T12:55:30	It's sad to watch (again), but those who insist on arguing Islam needs a reformation manage to misunderstand both Islam and the Reformation.

shadihamid	712616119782215680	2016-03-23T12:24:57	For why the tropes of "Islam needs a reformation" &amp; "Islamism is the problem" are dangerous, see my Atlantic essay. 
shadihamid	712438465863000064	2016-03-23T00:39:01	Student life has gotten a lot harder than I remember, apparently

shadihamid	712430225502707717	2016-03-23T00:06:16	emjayemjay whose opinion could it be but mine? (it's my account, after all). I've also written a whole book abt it: 
shadihamid	712421452788736000	2016-03-22T23:31:25	Interesting 
shadihamid	712396170946076673	2016-03-22T21:50:57	Given some of the reactions in Europe, gotta say ISIS has been pretty effective on this front... 
shadihamid	712415804420202496	2016-03-22T23:08:58	So even if ISIS wanted us to get more militarily involved in Iraq/Syria (and I'm skeptical), that, by itself, doesn't mean we shouldn't.
shadihamid	712413330619637761	2016-03-22T22:59:08	This is a good example of why shouldn't necessarily *not* want something just b/c ISIS wants it.  
shadihamid	712385196151201793	2016-03-22T21:07:20	3/7 Some of the group's stated objectives are 1. To weaken European cohesion (specifically w/ regard to Schengen)
shadihamid	712395808386195456	2016-03-22T21:49:31	Important mini-tweetstorm from BridgetMoreng on ISIS objectives in Europe. 
shadihamid	712367477074735104	2016-03-22T19:56:56	We can now expect surge of talk about how Islam needs to be reformed and how "Islamism" is the problem. Both claims wrong &amp; even dangerous.
shadihamid	712343196316143617	2016-03-22T18:20:27	Re-posting my essay in TheAtlantic on whether ISIS is "rational." Many of the same questions apply today:

shadihamid	712256216597196801	2016-03-22T12:34:49	BRRubin not sure how that diverges from what I've written here. that said, this was only two grafs. would have to read the whole book :)

shadihamid	712058868809990144	2016-03-21T23:30:38	That was probably the most genuinely alarming and unhinged speech I can recall hearing from a leading American politician.
shadihamid	712056740267892736	2016-03-21T23:22:10	Ok, I'm done (and genuinely scared). Sorry to say it, but Ted Cruz is kinda nuts and, more importantly, a threat to our national security.
shadihamid	712056039881965569	2016-03-21T23:19:23	Ted Cruz once again manages the impossible and makes Donald Trump seem like the sane, sensible candidate on foreign policy.
shadihamid	712054839384088576	2016-03-21T23:14:37	Shorter Ted Cruz: Obama hates Israel. I hate Palestinians.
shadihamid	712053378923307009	2016-03-21T23:08:49	Maybe I'm naive, but I'm still a bit shocked that a major presidential candidate can actually say: "Palestine has not existed since 1948."
shadihamid	712052623814369280	2016-03-21T23:05:49	sshadian i'm not sure voters really care that much about content
shadihamid	712052437008388096	2016-03-21T23:05:04	Huh? Did Cruz really just say that "Palestine has not existed since 1948"? Does that really means what I think it means?
shadihamid	712051569496186880	2016-03-21T23:01:38	It was an important speech, if nothing else, then for discovering who he is when he gives an actual speech. 
shadihamid	712051260900450305	2016-03-21T23:00:24	I think we also saw a good example of why Trump would be a more compelling general election candidate than many assume.
shadihamid	712051125613158400	2016-03-21T22:59:52	Content aside, that was a surprisingly well-delivered, *controlled* speech, suggesting Trump can shift gears pretty seamlessly. AIPAC2016
shadihamid	712049525213499392	2016-03-21T22:53:30	Palestinian ISIS = Hamas, says Trump. Except that real ISIS considers Hamas to be apostates. No matter: they're all Islamists. Sad!
shadihamid	712048605394300928	2016-03-21T22:49:51	This is weird. Donald Trump actually appears to be giving something resembling a prepared speech. AIPAC2016

shadihamid	708427300203704322	2016-03-11T23:00:04	The president is certain he’s right, but is that what we want in a leader? shadihamid explains: 
shadihamid	709821043758796800	2016-03-15T19:18:19	Russia clarifies that it will "continue airstrikes" after withdrawal. 
shadihamid	709817216074649600	2016-03-15T19:03:06	Marthe1945 denison it was never putin's goal to stop the civil war
shadihamid	709817066338000897	2016-03-15T19:02:31	DenisonBe and he's accomplished those as well
shadihamid	709816883688697857	2016-03-15T19:01:47	DenisonBe I think we can all agree that one of his goals was strengthening the Assad regime, which he did
shadihamid	709816669967925248	2016-03-15T19:00:56	DenisonBe as far as we know they're not leaving. See Kerry's statement (which I just tweeted)
shadihamid	709816475612286976	2016-03-15T19:00:10	Even John Kerry admits that Russia is *not* leaving Syria, only half of its forces. 
shadihamid	709815818222227456	2016-03-15T18:57:33	Because Putin achieved his goals. (And, again, we should be skeptical that he's actually leaving) 
shadihamid	708333179652931584	2016-03-11T16:46:04	Important shadihamid read re: ObamaDoctrine Iraq Syria  
shadihamid	709801137029799936	2016-03-15T17:59:13	The good old days of Obama before the "Obama Doctrine" (tweet from March 18, 2011): 
shadihamid	709770174577184768	2016-03-15T15:56:11	More info on book: . My responses to (understandable) concerns abt the word "exceptionalism": 
shadihamid	709766308410368000	2016-03-15T15:40:49	My new book IslamicExceptionalism makes The National's "pick of the best reads in 2016":  
shadihamid	709748781303132160	2016-03-15T14:31:10	Important paragraph from tcwittes: For Obama, it's not just abt military entanglement, but entanglement of any kind 
shadihamid	709746263491809280	2016-03-15T14:21:10	So many good bits in tcwittes' new piece on Obama's foreign policy legacy, I wouldn't know where to begin. Read it: 
shadihamid	708327722829934592	2016-03-11T16:24:23	Key from shadihamid: Obama sees Syria mostly as a messaging problem (specifically yours for failing to understand). 
shadihamid	708327530768502786	2016-03-11T16:23:38	For Obama, "Iraq's dark shadow seems to be everywhere," and it has blinded him on Syria.  v shadihamid
shadihamid	709667665921613824	2016-03-15T09:08:51	And now Putin gets to play peacemaker and get sanctions relief? shadihamid 
shadihamid	709578225173839872	2016-03-15T03:13:26	b00nhead74 except, of course, that Russia isn't retreating
shadihamid	709472583578595328	2016-03-14T20:13:39	reihan thanks. yep, you're right. guess I'll have to settle for (a) then :)
shadihamid	708374277591060480	2016-03-11T19:29:23	shadihamid This argument is (a) correct and (b) not likely to get a friendly reception.
shadihamid	708386218829062147	2016-03-11T20:16:50	Though shadihamid's critique of Obama focuses on his foreign policy worldview, it applies more broadly as well. 
shadihamid	709455502040702976	2016-03-14T19:05:47	I'm a bit worried about the non-"main" parts of Russia's military forces. 
shadihamid	709453960361299968	2016-03-14T18:59:39	I'm skeptical re: Russia, but even if it's true, Putin is pretty much right: it was a successful intervention &amp; Assad has been strengthened.
shadihamid	709076584737603584	2016-03-13T18:00:06	Writing for the TheAtlantic, shadihamid discusses Obama's surprising views on Islam: 
shadihamid	709398538971648000	2016-03-14T15:19:26	That the fundamental point of my critique of the Obama Doctrine:  
shadihamid	709432058964217856	2016-03-14T17:32:38	Just bought myself a copy of eteraz's debut novel Native Believer, which looks incredible:  
shadihamid	709424084174696448	2016-03-14T17:00:56	MichaelRWear thanks so much for the kind words! glad you liked the piece
shadihamid	708722857153597440	2016-03-12T18:34:31	And this next graf is just supremely thought-provoking shadihamid  
shadihamid	709408361595408385	2016-03-14T15:58:28	DHirschelBurns I'll take what I can get :)
shadihamid	708722484846137344	2016-03-12T18:33:02	This is an important paragraph:  
shadihamid	708319334804922368	2016-03-11T15:51:04	"Being right on Iraq may actually make you more likely to be wrong about future interventions" shadihamid on Obama 
shadihamid	709397979665403905	2016-03-14T15:17:12	If you, as a Syrian moderate, watched Obama's Aug 2013 about-face, how could you not lose faith in ever getting real US support?
shadihamid	709397124077723648	2016-03-14T15:13:48	On why secular activists tolerated radicals in the ranks: a reminder that what the US *doesn't* do can matter a lot. 
shadihamid	709387437835997184	2016-03-14T14:35:19	How the Syrian revolt went so horribly, tragically wrong | lizsly takes stock five years later. With my thoughts: 
shadihamid	708982417541959680	2016-03-13T11:45:55	Lots to mull over in shadihamid's piece in TheAtlantic but most intriguing is the notion of Obama as Huntingtonian 
shadihamid	709192617976860673	2016-03-14T01:41:10	jaibtarash hsmoghul trump actually said that?
shadihamid	709186480539832321	2016-03-14T01:16:47	.Abunass3r But talk of "defying" democratic outcomes (in the event of Trump presidency) also worries me: 
shadihamid	709182785018322944	2016-03-14T01:02:06	.SacCIO No one "teaches" Americans that coups are unacceptable; it's something we absorb in the process of being American BrendanNyhan
shadihamid	709181237907349504	2016-03-14T00:55:57	One scary lesson is that democratic norms, even in an established democracy, can erode more quickly than we thought. 
shadihamid	709162881313480704	2016-03-13T23:43:01	aarondmiller2 thanks for kind words, appreciate it :) but as I said in piece Iraq and Syria contexts are extremely different
shadihamid	709162415376588800	2016-03-13T23:41:10	aarondmiller2 goal of intervention wasn't to solve conflict but to diminish Assad's ability to kill &amp; to push him to actually negotiate 3/3
shadihamid	709162061863858177	2016-03-13T23:39:45	aarondmiller2 yes, Syria may be insoluble but that doesn't mean that all options are equally bad 2/3
shadihamid	709161315567153152	2016-03-13T23:36:47	aarondmiller2 choices in Syria are worse today than they were in early 2012 (and Aug 2013). which is why deferring can be so costly 1/2
shadihamid	709028526326996992	2016-03-13T14:49:08	shadihamid Similar phenom worldwide: unraveling of authority, credibility and past institutional frameworks. Came earlier and worse in ME

shadihamid	709021594732130304	2016-03-13T14:21:35	Another must-read: how Iraq warped Obama's worldview  in which shadihamid says BO is a "Huntingtonian" at heart
shadihamid	709058143880396800	2016-03-13T16:46:49	"Trump's Law" (noun): 1. The more people on my Twitter feed are outraged by Trump, the more likely he is to be the nominee.
shadihamid	709055359240019968	2016-03-13T16:35:45	That's part of what made it frightening. I thought Trump would go off the rails or start stammering. But he knew exactly what he was doing.
shadihamid	709054924173262848	2016-03-13T16:34:02	Trump's Meet the Press interview was scary, but I can see how it might be seen as effective &amp; impressive, if I was a GOP primary voter.
shadihamid	708713898627751936	2016-03-12T17:58:55	Obama is basically a Huntingtonian at heart, shadihamid adds 
shadihamid	708711710128001024	2016-03-12T17:50:13	Obama's 'don't do stupid shit' doctrine itself is a phrase dripping with disdain, argues shadihamid  ObamaDoctrine
shadihamid	709025421493407746	2016-03-13T14:36:48	shadihamid by the way I saw an account of trump supporters dedicated to providing volunteer security at rallies. Kernel of future militia?
shadihamid	709026232575377408	2016-03-13T14:40:01	BradChits those things are part of the dystopian scenarios that were previous mentioned. anyway, this was fun. grammar is tough
shadihamid	709025863547949060	2016-03-13T14:38:33	Not just in Middle East, but in (parts of) the US &amp; Europe, the next few decades might see some tough challenges to history's bending arc.
shadihamid	709024405339426818	2016-03-13T14:32:45	LibyaLiberty sorry, re-wrote a new tweet. It's here:  Deir_in_DC
shadihamid	709024142117445632	2016-03-13T14:31:43	BradChits the other possibility, of course, is that you're unaware of the meaning of the words "dystopian" &amp; "scenarios"
shadihamid	709023557087584256	2016-03-13T14:29:23	Guess the whole pro-Trump militias thing doesn't seem all that farfetched anymore.
shadihamid	709023353470894080	2016-03-13T14:28:35	A friend &amp; I were discussing dystopian Trumpian scenarios two weeks ago. Internment camps, (threats of) coups &amp; pro-Trump militias came up.

shadihamid	708388354098925568	2016-03-11T20:25:19	An intriguing (even somewhat leftish?) critique of "the Obama doctrine" interview by shadihamid. 
shadihamid	708720036458979329	2016-03-12T18:23:18	My cab driver in Chicago this morning said he was going to vote for Bernie before the Trump rally unrest. Now voting Trump.

shadihamid	708702898264395776	2016-03-12T17:15:12	+ no recognition of historic/current US support of Arab dictators who repress civic organising he says doesn't exist 
shadihamid	708699795968401408	2016-03-12T17:02:53	Calling the region a "shit show" and going on about the hopeless "tribalism" of Arabs isn't far removed from Palin's "let Allah sort 'em."
shadihamid	708698679465648128	2016-03-12T16:58:26	There was always something that made me vaguely uncomfortable in the way Obama talked about Muslims. Until Goldberg's piece made it clear.

shadihamid	708315607247282176	2016-03-11T15:36:15	This is really quite good by shadihamid as a response to Pres. Obama: 
shadihamid	708374536740343808	2016-03-11T19:30:25	It can lead to intellectual laziness: 'If I'm one of the few who was right about biggest modern foreign policy blunder, I must be special.'
shadihamid	708373460683264000	2016-03-11T19:26:08	All too often, politicians who were right about Iraq tend to overestimate what that says about their foreign-policy judgment.
shadihamid	708372914362564608	2016-03-11T19:23:58	I argue that being right on Iraq may actually make you more likely to be wrong about other things:

shadihamid	707952497659387907	2016-03-10T15:33:23	It's a Rorschach Test of sorts. Obama, in my view, does not come out looking good at all: arrogant, dismissive, and intellectually rigid.

shadihamid	707778841360658433	2016-03-10T04:03:20	Of course in Middle East, it's not history at all: we're among the most consistent supporters of brutal, authoritarian regimes.
shadihamid	707777905665908736	2016-03-10T03:59:37	Bernie's generally weak on foreign policy, but glad that someone brings up our tragic history of undermining democracy in Latin America.

shadihamid	707765757145440256	2016-03-10T03:11:20	ayeshaijazkhan seems like you read quite a lot into that tweet, which was actually about highlighting precisely those incorrect perceptions
shadihamid	707764758968209408	2016-03-10T03:07:22	Do people really care about that? 
shadihamid	707764510711529473	2016-03-10T03:06:23	ayeshaijazkhan you do realize that that tweet was a joke, right?

shadihamid	705838352340279296	2016-03-04T19:32:31	6. Reason Americans don't talk abt military coups, "deep states," etc is b/c of the power of norms, but what if those norms begin to erode?
shadihamid	705837622845956096	2016-03-04T19:29:37	5. How an American "deep state" might respond to (or defy) a democratically-elected president is a pretty interesting, if scary, question
shadihamid	705836419663712257	2016-03-04T19:24:50	4. I study the Middle East so it's "normal" to me, but I never thought I'd get in debates about "respecting democratic outcomes" in the US

shadihamid	705835478826803200	2016-03-04T19:21:06	2. This also applies to the Republican primary, where GOP leaders talk about basically negating the will of voters come convention time
shadihamid	705834962008858625	2016-03-04T19:19:03	1. As much as a President Trump frightens me, talk of aggressively undermining a democratically-elected leader makes me a bit uncomfortable
shadihamid	705832678587809792	2016-03-04T19:09:58	This is why it's vaguely reassuring that Trump is a flip-flopper, unlike Cruz who seems "principled" on torture.

shadihamid	704458316785848320	2016-03-01T00:08:45	I guess Trump could be the first, real "post-ideological" candidate. Another reason why we shouldn't underestimate him in the general.

shadihamid	704391562084687874	2016-02-29T19:43:30	aarondmiller2 those were large-scale ground troop interventions. No one, to my knowledge, suggesting anything similar in Syria

shadihamid	704389483769303040	2016-02-29T19:35:14	evanchill yes, since we intervened it was no longer likely. that's precisely my point
shadihamid	704389194471383041	2016-02-29T19:34:05	aarondmiller2 problem then isn't the intervention itself (which accomplished its objectives); it's our failure to engage after intervention
shadihamid	704388958176858114	2016-02-29T19:33:09	evanchill in another words, pre-intervention deaths *should* be relatively low
shadihamid	704388873741332480	2016-02-29T19:32:49	evanchill most reliable estimates are 1-2k. in any case, number is "low," b/c NATO intervened relatively quickly
shadihamid	704388494412660738	2016-02-29T19:31:18	.aarondmiller2 And it's unclear to me why Iraq should color our Syria policy too much, since the contexts are very, very different

shadihamid	698607734887944193	2016-02-13T20:40:38	If Trumps actually wins the nomination, a lot of people are going to have to ponder where exactly their ethical "red lines" are.
shadihamid	698606258627207168	2016-02-13T20:34:46	Intriguing piece by dandrezner on the ethics of advising Donald Trump on foreign policy: 
shadihamid	698554221503844354	2016-02-13T17:07:59	I remember when ppl used to say that if we intervened in Syria there would be spillover effects, and that it was better to "contain" things.
shadihamid	698553682460327941	2016-02-13T17:05:51	Exactly. This isn't just about Syria. It's about ISIS, MENA security, European security, the list goes on

shadihamid	697843350095994881	2016-02-11T18:03:14	Why doesn’t Obama seem to listen to Syria experts? MUST READ by shadihamid  
shadihamid	698201287041662976	2016-02-12T17:45:33	Read shadihamid recent tweets. Easy to avoid a debate about Syria by saying "This will lead to a war w Russia".Reality is more complicated
shadihamid	698199241366376448	2016-02-12T17:37:25	AthertonKD but why do we presume the Russians would?
shadihamid	698199109891727360	2016-02-12T17:36:54	stcolumbia see my subsequent tweets. which raises question: could any threat from Obama actually ever be perceived as credible at this pt?
shadihamid	698198764868235264	2016-02-12T17:35:32	If I was Putin and Obama/Kerry said there'd be military consequences in Aleppo, I would not believe it. In other words, credibility matters.
shadihamid	698198317872840704	2016-02-12T17:33:45	The idea (promoted by Kerry) that intervening in Aleppo would require going to war w- Russia is a straw man 
shadihamid	698197748630290433	2016-02-12T17:31:29	One problem is that any US threats might not be perceived as credible by the Russians (since they haven't been for 5 years).
shadihamid	698197297721638913	2016-02-12T17:29:42	If Russia viewed US threats as credible, it's unlikely they would pick a direct military confrontation w- the US 
shadihamid	698194645138993152	2016-02-12T17:19:09	See also this smart piece from jolidort in TheNatlInterest on why the US has no business calling ISIS 'apostates': 
shadihamid	698194320713711616	2016-02-12T17:17:52	Here's mradamtaylor's original WaPo piece from last wk on Kerry using the word 'apostates,' which raised concerns:

shadihamid	697983971133648897	2016-02-12T03:22:01	One of the best foreign policy questions asked of the republicans should be asked of the dems: should we stand with authoritarian allies?

shadihamid	697241049182445568	2016-02-10T02:09:54	maxjrosenthal which half?
shadihamid	697240258564530176	2016-02-10T02:06:46	Heh. This deserves some kind of award 
shadihamid	697239802199089153	2016-02-10T02:04:57	Trump is basically a Democrat who (says) he hates Muslims and immigration. That could be appealing to both Democrats and Republicans.
shadihamid	697239198479314944	2016-02-10T02:02:33	I find it sort of baffling that (nearly) everyone assumes that Trump would be easy pickings for Democrats in the general. Worth reasessing

shadihamid	697238119305891840	2016-02-10T01:58:16	I'm in the minority here but I actually think Trump would (unfortunately) be a formidable general election candidate

shadihamid	697217113681952768	2016-02-10T00:34:48	victorjwilli ha, yes, indeed
shadihamid	697217069297897472	2016-02-10T00:34:37	bilgeyesil1 yes :)
shadihamid	697216972984074240	2016-02-10T00:34:14	victorjwilli MB types would acknowledge this if pressed. Islamists are modernists so more interested in retroactive reintrepretation
shadihamid	697216345050632192	2016-02-10T00:31:44	victorjwilli right, wasn't technically a caliphate under Mohamed, but it was under the first four caliphs, which Sissi is also referring to
shadihamid	697216044067373056	2016-02-10T00:30:33	victorjwilli sure. but referring to early caliphate as an ideal form of government is pretty standard among Islamists (and non-Islamists)
shadihamid	697215671722250240	2016-02-10T00:29:04	.heissenstat It's the phenomenon of "Islamism without Islamists" which I discuss in the new book. So get excited :) 
shadihamid	697215119974141953	2016-02-10T00:26:52	.heissenstat Exactly. In a conservative country like Egypt, many supposed "secularists" would still see early caliphate as an ideal
shadihamid	697214402244780032	2016-02-10T00:24:01	victorjwilli not sure I understand? he's referring to the caliphate under the Prophet and the righteously guided companions
shadihamid	697212968866615300	2016-02-10T00:18:20	I guess Mohamed Morsi agrees with Sissi.

shadihamid	697211534167183360	2016-02-10T00:12:37	President Sissi on the early caliphate, which he says is "considered the ideal form of government." From 2006 thesis

shadihamid	697146071273893888	2016-02-09T19:52:30	A less charitable, but still probably fair reading is that Obama is basically giving Russia (yet another) "green light" in Syria.
shadihamid	697144704069140480	2016-02-09T19:47:04	Incredible. Here's the State Dept publicly announcing that there are no actual consequences for Russia's actions

shadihamid	696848123763810304	2016-02-09T00:08:34	Through US policy on Syria, shadihamid has written a fascinating piece on the role and constraints of think tanks.  
shadihamid	697084078189899776	2016-02-09T15:46:10	US-Syria policy isn't just "bad." It's more cynical &amp; destructive than that word suggests. emile_hokayem's piece captures this quite well.
shadihamid	697080037426798592	2016-02-09T15:30:06	We might soon see "the greatest setback to the rebellion since start of the uprising in 2011” and the US is looking the other way, or worse.

shadihamid	696718421644468225	2016-02-08T15:33:10	Of course, it raises the interesting question of whether Obama's disastrous Syria policy is itself a long-term "effect" of the Iraq war. 2/2
shadihamid	696718110351613952	2016-02-08T15:31:56	I don't think Obama's disastrous Syria policy is equivalent to blunder of Iraq war, but its long-term effects could prove more costly. 1/2

shadihamid	693486773498826753	2016-01-30T17:31:45	Which raises a question: can a cleric be "moderate" if he enthusiastically backs mass killings? I'd think not, but apparently some disagree.

shadihamid	684163747246682116	2016-01-05T00:05:23	Probably one of my top 5 albums of the 2000s. "Look Outside" is a thing of utter beauty:  
shadihamid	684148489547345920	2016-01-04T23:04:45	But how does ISIS feel about entitlement reform? 
shadihamid	683577146028220416	2016-01-03T09:14:26	I agree with the broad thrust of this, and will continue to use “Islamic State” as the name, not Daesh. ISIS 
shadihamid	684135277753987072	2016-01-04T22:12:15	A cautionary note. 10 years from now, it's possible ISIS (or successors) could still control significant territory 
shadihamid	684128535871664129	2016-01-04T21:45:28	@betterworld2100 come on, nathan. you probably have a sense of what I'd do differently, no?
shadihamid	684123437187608576	2016-01-04T21:25:12	Bizarre that Administration would be caught "flat-footed" on this. Maybe they should find someone who reads Arabic.

shadihamid	684123086552174594	2016-01-04T21:23:48	But b/c of our desire to disengage from Middle East, we effectively outsourced our Yemen policy to the Saudis, to disastrous effect.
shadihamid	684122908562685952	2016-01-04T21:23:06	It gets little attention, but US enabling of KSA's failed Yemen interventions is just one example of an unmoored bilateral relationship.
shadihamid	684121311988289542	2016-01-04T21:16:45	Rethinking US policy in the Middle East requires rethinking our entire alliance structure, something which we have little interest in doing.
shadihamid	684120448251113472	2016-01-04T21:13:19	Same old story. US caught flat-footed by its Arab allies, almost all of whom regularly act contrary to US interests. 
shadihamid	684119253159665664	2016-01-04T21:08:34	I thought ppl were joking when they said Morocco was trending b/c of Trump. But apparently it's true... 
shadihamid	684117861774798849	2016-01-04T21:03:03	sodiumlitskies thanks, that's really nice of you to say. will try to keep sharing the good stuff I come across
shadihamid	684113757988073473	2016-01-04T20:46:44	shadihamid uhm why are we trending???
shadihamid	684113139781218304	2016-01-04T20:44:17	Whenever I see an Arab country trending, I get nervous.

shadihamid	684094169527246848	2016-01-04T19:28:54	Wow 
shadihamid	684088858988933120	2016-01-04T19:07:48	sheernoise hope you guys play in dc soon!
shadihamid	683766671664787456	2016-01-03T21:47:32	I loved Weiss/Hassan's book; now I'm moving onto Hamid's. Nice list.  
shadihamid	683843791363518465	2016-01-04T02:53:59	From the Iran deal to ISIS, read what Brookings experts had to say about the biggest Middle East stories of 2015: 
shadihamid	684034000873193474	2016-01-04T15:29:49	This by lprubin73 is the best piece on Israel's Islamist movement that I've read in the past year. Fascinating. 
shadihamid	684031574879387648	2016-01-04T15:20:10	Some great Middle East books in abuaardvark’s best of 2015 list, including from charles_lister &amp; masoudtarek:

shadihamid	683983972297080833	2016-01-04T12:11:01	Bruce Riedel explains why 2016 will be a difficult year for the Saudi kingdom:  
shadihamid	683787953114607616	2016-01-03T23:12:06	LA neo-shoegazers sheernoise are one of my favorite new bands. Here's "Bored to Death" from their debut album: 
shadihamid	683738277648711680	2016-01-03T19:54:43	MazMHussain sure, agree. just saying that there's more to it. I don't think a liberal celebrity could replicate his success
shadihamid	683737325889785856	2016-01-03T19:50:56	MazMHussain I don't think it's just that. It's also because Donald Trump, as much as we might hate it, is actually a compelling candidate
shadihamid	683671815584149504	2016-01-03T15:30:37	"Something odd about an American president or Secretary of State opining on what is and isn’t legitimately Islamic." 
shadihamid	683435014042841088	2016-01-02T23:49:39	Imagine POTUS warning an American ethnic group after an individual committed crime; Bibi just warned Arab Israelis 
shadihamid	683425804601135109	2016-01-02T23:13:03	@Mr_Mubin_Shaikh but that's how we identify most groups/movements. No one decided to call Shining Path the "Path of Darkness" azelin
shadihamid	683424361198534656	2016-01-02T23:07:19	@Mr_Mubin_Shaikh azelin or "Islamic State" instead of "the Islamic State"
shadihamid	683423945043906560	2016-01-02T23:05:40	While most analytically accurate option is "the Islamic State," the most problematic is "Daesh," as we argue here: 
shadihamid	683422441100709888	2016-01-02T22:59:41	Arabellastory no that's not the reason
shadihamid	683422039298957312	2016-01-02T22:58:06	Smart, short post by azelin on why the most analytically accurate option is to call ISIS "the Islamic State."

shadihamid	683350035979960320	2016-01-02T18:11:59	Peldorskeletor yes, natural, in the sense of allowing the process to proceed, without internal or external actors blocking or ending it
shadihamid	683346093481000962	2016-01-02T17:56:19	shadihamid and in that note, Happy New Year!

shadihamid	683345528520851456	2016-01-02T17:54:04	More you postpone &amp; block the messy, natural process of democratization, the worse it gets. The next few years (decades) will be quite bad.

shadihamid	683343246173540356	2016-01-02T17:45:00	The Middle East had to go through this, to work out slowly - and with difficulty - the relationship btw Islam &amp; politics. But it didn't.
shadihamid	683342814860673024	2016-01-02T17:43:17	I couldn't help but read this from Ovamir Anjum's book and wonder. It's almost as if history was put on hold. 
shadihamid	683342118748815360	2016-01-02T17:40:31	Ovamir Anjum's book on Islamic political thought, the caliphate, and Ibn Taymiyyah looks fascinating:
