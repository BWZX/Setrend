rtraister	713361045088243712	2016-03-25T13:45:01	Two of them are black women, which would TRIPLE number to have served in Senate. (Again, that's one, Moseley Braun, elected 24 years ago).
rtraister	713360777600753664	2016-03-25T13:43:57	Clarification: Several women of color running for Senate (Edwards, Harris, Duckworth, Cortez Masto) &amp; have been 2 WOC in Senate history. 1/2
rtraister	713359603732451330	2016-03-25T13:39:17	MsMakkah yes I was, in re Edwards and Harris, but WOC included Hirono currently in Congress.

rtraister	713358781476900864	2016-03-25T13:36:01	Also in Feb, Wapo reported that Edwards had less than 1/10 of what Van Hollen had in bank? 300,000 v 3.6 million. 
rtraister	713356509741256704	2016-03-25T13:27:00	And Tammy Duckworth. 
rtraister	713352949184008192	2016-03-25T13:12:51	Right! Catherine Cortex Masto in Nevada! Thank you.  
rtraister	713351382372392960	2016-03-25T13:06:37	Also, it matters that they are both running for Senate seats long held by Dem women (Mikulski &amp; Boxer). Senate 20% women.
rtraister	713350507964792832	2016-03-25T13:03:09	There are two women of color currently running for Senate, Edwards &amp; Kamala Harris. If elected, they'd double # of WOC in Senate, in HISTORY
rtraister	713349860418826240	2016-03-25T13:00:34	But it doesn’t take away anything from Van Hollen to note that Edwards is also good!  
rtraister	713349669393268736	2016-03-25T12:59:49	What a strange article. Runs from premise that, b/c Van Hollen is a good guy, he should presumptively be nominee. 
rtraister	713348847297290240	2016-03-25T12:56:33	...this is not a situation in which the playing field started level. We have grave &amp; unjust representational errors to correct.
rtraister	713348214930477056	2016-03-25T12:54:02	Which is not to say that there aren't reasonable conversations to be had about spending money against other progressive candidates, but...
rtraister	713348055244865536	2016-03-25T12:53:24	Not mentioned in this piece is that the U.S. has only elected ONE black woman to the Senate, ever, in its history. 
rtraister	713144909855739907	2016-03-24T23:26:10	😂

rtraister	696716285539938304	2016-02-08T15:24:41	8. Then I am afraid you are serving as exhibit A.
rtraister	696716220918321152	2016-02-08T15:24:26	7. But if u really believe you have invalidated the argument that the left has women issues simply by discovering that I made it in 08...
rtraister	696716100701188096	2016-02-08T15:23:57	6. It's all about sexism/racism/classism in 2008 (toward HRC, Michelle O, Palin) much of it from the left.
rtraister	696715902889431041	2016-02-08T15:23:10	5. These are indeed patterns I write about, alas, over &amp; over again. You can read more about them in my first book: 
rtraister	696715825957441536	2016-02-08T15:22:51	4. To suggest feminist critique is invalid be it was leveled similarly 8 years ago shows huge lack of comprehension of how sexism works.
rtraister	696715601792933890	2016-02-08T15:21:58	3. This argument is in &amp; of itself a pretty telling embodiment of a progressive lack of interest in/respect for feminist commentary.
rtraister	696715517629984769	2016-02-08T15:21:38	2. Their inference: the argument that there's misogyny tied up in reactions to HRC must not be true bc I wrote about it last time she ran.
rtraister	696715401154183168	2016-02-08T15:21:10	1. So mtaibbi &amp; GlennGreenwald tweeted piece I wrote in 08 re sexism from progressives w one I wrote this year re sexism from progressives

rtraister	695655163063889920	2016-02-05T17:08:10	welknett Right, and well...there's where this whole mess starts.
rtraister	695654257836609536	2016-02-05T17:04:34	welknett ...that the bigger picture comes into focus. Not every column filed after Iowa can (or should) include run down of all context
rtraister	695654095441502208	2016-02-05T17:03:55	welknett Well, that's nature of my work, in part. Most weeks I write stand alone reactions/columns. It's only in a book or bigger feature..
rtraister	695653941456084992	2016-02-05T17:03:18	welknett Then make a run...there just aren't that many women who've run big races like this.
rtraister	695653867476926464	2016-02-05T17:03:01	welknett I'm sure someone has tried! But right now  it's probably impossible...to have pre-race approval s you have to be known quantity
rtraister	695653017367027712	2016-02-05T16:59:38	welknett But also appreciate and respect that you didn't like it, respond to it, agree with it. Fair enough!
rtraister	695652917894897665	2016-02-05T16:59:14	welknett The article after Iowa? Was about one angle -- women's self-presentation in political debate. Wasn't about whole record.
rtraister	695652533893783552	2016-02-05T16:57:43	welknett It is true. I think it's a bigger shift for women, but not a huge sample size.
rtraister	695652340003704833	2016-02-05T16:56:57	welknett So putting the candidates and the media reactions to them in historical, gendered context is what I do.
rtraister	695652063829741569	2016-02-05T16:55:51	welknett Look, I bet we don't agree on her! I like her more than you. But my job is to write re women &amp; politics from feminist perspective.
rtraister	695651695863468032	2016-02-05T16:54:23	welknett Here's a piece about my deeply mixed feelings about her: 
rtraister	695651422994563074	2016-02-05T16:53:18	welknett This includes some stuff about her shifting positions over the years: 
rtraister	695651260851220481	2016-02-05T16:52:39	welknett Starting here, probably: 
rtraister	695651159923671040	2016-02-05T16:52:15	welknett Not this morning. But I've written a book about her, &amp; about a million pieces, many include critiques includng feminist ones
rtraister	695650741550260224	2016-02-05T16:50:36	welknett Ha, didn't mean she was universally beloved-never. Just that her approval ratings are far higher when not running than when she is
rtraister	695650356441776128	2016-02-05T16:49:04	welknett It's dishonest not to acknowledge long lasting, powerful expectations for how women &amp; men are supposed to comport publicly
rtraister	695650205597888512	2016-02-05T16:48:28	welknett But when two candidates debate each other forcefully, and the Times describes it as her being tense &amp; angry &amp; him being calm
rtraister	695650017667846145	2016-02-05T16:47:43	welknett I don't chalk it up to misogyny alone. Look, being a woman also helps her in lots of ways.
rtraister	695649537357172736	2016-02-05T16:45:48	welknett When women move from standing still--well loved, perhaps, in their roles--to actually running, the reception changes.
rtraister	695649456235155456	2016-02-05T16:45:29	welknett Warren hasn't done any of that. Also, HRC is also much beloved, hero-worshipped, when she's not running.
rtraister	695649269567660032	2016-02-05T16:44:45	welknett So much of what's unlikeable about HRC is what she's done in service of presidential ambition -- strategizing, contorting.
rtraister	695649147022610432	2016-02-05T16:44:15	welknett It also matters that she's NOT running. She has given no sign of wanting to be president. Which makes her very easy to like!
rtraister	695648968076877824	2016-02-05T16:43:33	welknett I wish she were running, I really really do. But it's a fantasy to think that she'd escape these kinds of double standards.
rtraister	695648856701321216	2016-02-05T16:43:06	welknett As a woman, she'd be getting hit harder than Sanders on foreign policy gaps. Way harder.
rtraister	695648773993861120	2016-02-05T16:42:46	welknett And if she were, she'd be getting a lot of the same crap. When she ran for senate, she was tagged as wooden, inauthentic, elite.
rtraister	695648641109901313	2016-02-05T16:42:15	welknett I also love Warren and wrote a piece begging her (and others) to challenge Clinton. But but she's not running for president.
rtraister	695643499908112384	2016-02-05T16:21:49	STrimel Upstreamism Also, it's not a refrain whenever she's criticized. It's when she's criticized in a particularly gendered way.
rtraister	695642853058482176	2016-02-05T16:19:15	STrimel Upstreamism Among them, looking at the reception of person running to be first woman president.
rtraister	695642778768900096	2016-02-05T16:18:57	STrimel Upstreamism I think it makes sense to talk about the impact of sexism from a lot of angles.
rtraister	695640524443815940	2016-02-05T16:10:00	"When we hear that she’s not 'likable,' we know what that really means-&amp; what it means for us." 
rtraister	695636233075191809	2016-02-05T15:52:56	jacaem55 rtraister notLane: feminist here. it doesn't help to yell sexism/misogyny whenever Hil is criticized. Diminishes real sexism.

rtraister	695611786893123584	2016-02-05T14:15:48	What's interesting about nuanced, historical approach is that it's a calmer way to put stuff like this in context: 
rtraister	695611068689813505	2016-02-05T14:12:57	This is a different conversation, far more nuanced, about history &amp; context of female self-presentation &amp; public reception in male sphere.

rtraister	695610620989874176	2016-02-05T14:11:10	From this, which suggests that Clinton campaign now wants to talk re structural realities of gender in politics: 
rtraister	695610449438572545	2016-02-05T14:10:29	Women's beliefs re playing w/in system in order to "make it in a man’s world" did "not rule out reform, but it did crimp revolution"

rtraister	695382763097055234	2016-02-04T23:05:44	thrashRadical annfriedman So much of what's distasteful about HRC is what she's done in service of presidential ambition, right?
rtraister	695382696105627648	2016-02-04T23:05:28	thrashRadical annfriedman Also crucial that she's not strategized around presidential ambition, as HRC (&amp; every other pres) has.
rtraister	695382531399557120	2016-02-04T23:04:49	thrashRadical annfriedman I think she, as a woman, would be hit much harder than Bernie has on lack of FP experience.

rtraister	695382372406038528	2016-02-04T23:04:11	thrashRadical annfriedman The short version is, I think we fool ourselves to think she wouldn't be subject to related criticism.

rtraister	695368630599442432	2016-02-04T22:09:35	ActuallyImGood FisherBurton My opinion is that HRC's support for Cuomo is a very valid thing to critique her for &amp; I liked Kate's piece.
rtraister	695368028477747200	2016-02-04T22:07:11	FisherBurton In fact, I'm pretty sure that that's the very point Steinem makes in her endorsement of him against the Republican woman.
rtraister	695367918217859072	2016-02-04T22:06:45	FisherBurton No one in the context of article or our exchange has suggested that a man can't be a better feminist than a woman.
rtraister	695366727438356480	2016-02-04T22:02:01	FisherBurton But FWIW I do question your tweets, since neither Dem women in question is comparable to Palin, who you cited earlier.
rtraister	695366184372346880	2016-02-04T21:59:52	FisherBurton It seems to me that you're the one making further inferences re Bernie's claims about being a better feminist etc..

rtraister	695029790441500672	2016-02-03T23:43:09	On the issue of guns, HillaryClinton is pretty clearly to BernieSanders left. On a bunch of other issues, they're basically the same place
rtraister	695028792025182209	2016-02-03T23:39:11	Whoa. As Burr says in Hamilton "Alright so we're doing this."  
rtraister	695019158514311168	2016-02-03T23:00:54	I mean, it's been five years now I've been talking about how my book is almost done. I guess now it's true. Also: terrifying.
rtraister	695018865898754048	2016-02-03T22:59:45	Stop your lying. 
rtraister	695009011607957505	2016-02-03T22:20:35	DougHenwood Of course! What else would motivate me besides unthinking &amp; venal self-regard? &amp; yes: the rain reveals its bias against us all.
rtraister	695007714842394624	2016-02-03T22:15:26	DougHenwood It's just my corporatist identitarian impulse to protect my own bourgeois self-interest talking.
rtraister	695003872335679489	2016-02-03T22:00:10	DougHenwood Cut the mansplaining, bro.
rtraister	695003010200682497	2016-02-03T21:56:44	Been out all day. Glad to find things very civilized and not at all intense or ill-tempered on primary internet today. GoodTimes
rtraister	694938441662996481	2016-02-03T17:40:10	SamAdlerBell robyn_shapiro but this is changing - her candidacy and how we receive it us part of shifting the paradigms.
rtraister	694938310918144000	2016-02-03T17:39:39	SamAdlerBell robyn_shapiro more that women radicals would never have gotten to plausible candidacy, especially not "first" woman
rtraister	694938177124044800	2016-02-03T17:39:07	SamAdlerBell robyn_shapiro but mostly, no, I'm@not suggesting she's a natural radical who's kept her light under a bushel.
rtraister	694938033649537034	2016-02-03T17:38:33	SamAdlerBell robyn_shapiro though there are surprising moments - Hyde! Pretty radical.
rtraister	694937901403148288	2016-02-03T17:38:01	SamAdlerBell robyn_shapiro that urge was likely stamped out early.
rtraister	694937834973691904	2016-02-03T17:37:45	SamAdlerBell robyn_shapiro though also, yes, to whatever degree she might have been inclined to be more radical, in style or substance
rtraister	694937694724612096	2016-02-03T17:37:12	SamAdlerBell robyn_shapiro I'm saying in part that the phenomenon selects for a candidate like HRC.
rtraister	694937480039129088	2016-02-03T17:36:21	SamAdlerBell robyn_shapiro so much to reply to all this but bad work schedule - soon!

rtraister	694915614926888964	2016-02-03T16:09:28	NDiSabat Right, that's how it goes. Many non-sexist reasons to support Bernie! This doesn't suggest otherwise.

rtraister	694901946076041220	2016-02-03T15:15:09	jebediahreed Oh god, yes, sounding more like Thatcher should do the trick!
rtraister	694897604824600576	2016-02-03T14:57:54	Oh, this is worth watching. "Oddly enough" HRC's problem is that she shouts. [nods]  
rtraister	694609517980602369	2016-02-02T19:53:08	Cruz and Sanders have run the best campaigns so far, IMHO. (And I think HRC has run a much better campaign than she gets credit for)
rtraister	694621410145222656	2016-02-02T20:40:24	Clinton won union households last night 52 - 43 
rtraister	694658848741838848	2016-02-02T23:09:10	A hilarious ALL-CAPS pro-Hillary rant 
rtraister	694645315568300032	2016-02-02T22:15:23	anatinsly You and I are clearly talking past each other right now. I wish you all the best.
rtraister	694641584558718977	2016-02-02T22:00:34	anatinsly Sorry, where did I say we should celebrate her?
rtraister	694641180387217408	2016-02-02T21:58:57	anatinsly Or to make clear that repro access is an economic issue that disproportionately impacts poor women and women of color?
rtraister	694640988199985154	2016-02-02T21:58:12	anatinsly also is there no feminist engagement with the fact that HRC is first mainstream candidate to emphasize objections to Hyde?
rtraister	694640648465575936	2016-02-02T21:56:51	anatinsly right so your stance is that there should be no feminist engagement with the first woman to get close to the presidency?
rtraister	694639119088119808	2016-02-02T21:50:46	anatinsly I have never suggest that you should feel otherwise.
rtraister	694638765722198018	2016-02-02T21:49:22	Crayz9000 anatinsly No problem! Everyone's welcome.
rtraister	694638520137355265	2016-02-02T21:48:23	anatinsly Because it might get picked up by people who use it too bluntly in political fights?
rtraister	694638428701462528	2016-02-02T21:48:01	anatinsly So then there should be no feminist consideration of the first woman to come close to the presidency in American history?
rtraister	694638282345431040	2016-02-02T21:47:26	anatinsly There is nothing in the piece I wrote today about HRC critics being sexist trolls.
rtraister	694637920897126401	2016-02-02T21:46:00	anatinsly and disinterest in policies that disproportionately impact them. There are perspectives. Yours is one, and a compelling one.
rtraister	694637780622839810	2016-02-02T21:45:27	anatinsly I don't mind harsh. What I mind is implication that any defense of Clinton is rooted in disregard for poor women &amp; woc.
rtraister	694636070428872704	2016-02-02T21:38:39	anatinsly Crayz9000 And I don't think that's true at all.
rtraister	694635941751869442	2016-02-02T21:38:08	anatinsly Crayz9000 Legitimate! But yr argument is that defense of HRC, or attempts to situate her in a feminist context, is illegitimate.
rtraister	694634269730283520	2016-02-02T21:31:30	anatinsly Crayz9000 against defense of the candidate who's been out in front on Hyde &amp; Flint, for example.
rtraister	694634170329501698	2016-02-02T21:31:06	anatinsly Crayz9000 And FWIW I don't think that a focus on issues that disproportionately impact women of color automatically mitigates
rtraister	694634062951096320	2016-02-02T21:30:40	anatinsly Crayz9000 I understand your argument, Ana. But I also think that not every story is about every issues.
rtraister	694632987774836738	2016-02-02T21:26:24	FisherBurton I agree! this is all changing around us, in part because of and in reaction to HRC.
rtraister	694632851279585280	2016-02-02T21:25:52	nickconfessore So some get to play  louder &amp; looser, individually, bc they don't stand in for threat of increased female power thru policy.
rtraister	694632459489644545	2016-02-02T21:24:18	nickconfessore Yes, tho dynamics on right so different for women. Bc policies they run on support rather than disrupt power structure.
rtraister	694631846370476032	2016-02-02T21:21:52	So to some degree, the expectations/paradigm I describe selected for a pragmatist like HRC. nickconfessore
rtraister	694631512608788481	2016-02-02T21:20:32	Rather that a loud revolutionary was never going to be the first viable female candidate for president.  
rtraister	694631346271055873	2016-02-02T21:19:53	Not an alternate theory--a complementary observation. My point was not that HRC is a crypto-revolutionary... 
rtraister	694616276564590594	2016-02-02T20:20:00	DaveyStrategies Hi Lynn! Thank you!
rtraister	694613386236133376	2016-02-02T20:08:31	Chris_arnade Easy to read a consideration of gender/sexism and presume it to be a full excuse. But I don't present it as one I don't think.
rtraister	694613171085139970	2016-02-02T20:07:39	Chris_arnade But nothing in this piece suggested that the critique therein invalidated other critiques.
rtraister	694612968391217152	2016-02-02T20:06:51	Chris_arnade There're illions of pieces out there about what she's doing wrong or right politically, strategically, the reaction of voters
rtraister	694612821292773376	2016-02-02T20:06:16	Chris_arnade But the piece wasn't about "Why is she failing" it was about "here is a thing she did differently last night"
rtraister	694612670906028032	2016-02-02T20:05:40	Chris_arnade Not necessarily to account for her whole history, or full breadth of complaint against her, &amp; certainly not in every piece.
rtraister	694612537342562304	2016-02-02T20:05:08	Chris_arnade But my job is a fairly specific one: it's to put her story in gendered and historical context, which is what I was doing here.
rtraister	694612444921069568	2016-02-02T20:04:46	Chris_arnade So I understand that framing might not satisfy yr critiques which are real &amp; not invalidated by gendered consideration
rtraister	694612219733098496	2016-02-02T20:03:53	Chris_arnade But also, my JOB is to consider her role in a gendered context.
rtraister	694611947749273602	2016-02-02T20:02:48	Chris_arnade And my piece today was not a comprehensive rundown. It was a post-Iowa reaction piece re one aspect of her self presentation.
rtraister	694611823287496705	2016-02-02T20:02:18	Chris_arnade Well, I don't think that style is the only way to look at Clintons. I write a ton about HRC. Have written a book about her.
rtraister	694605857380655108	2016-02-02T19:38:36	The overriding theme to Clinton’s time in public life is that she’s Not Doing It Right — whatever she’s doing, however she’s doing it.
rtraister	694605545169252352	2016-02-02T19:37:21	And if y’all think Warren wouldn’t be reduced to a series of grotesque female caricatures in about 5 min. in the nat’l spotlight, yer crazy.
rtraister	694605368123457536	2016-02-02T19:36:39	Yet somehow we never find the perfect female candidate. There’s no winning that game.
rtraister	694605202310049793	2016-02-02T19:36:00	And of course it’s never misogyny … it’s always, we’d like her fine if she just acted more like this *other* woman. More this, less that.
rtraister	694594318791741440	2016-02-02T18:52:45	zrok_ No, she's never been inevitable. And she does have massive establishment support. But that's evidence of how UN-inevitable she is.
rtraister	694588714085933057	2016-02-02T18:30:28	KnowWorkNoMoney Yes, but none of them were viable presidential candidates, which is what this piece was about.
rtraister	694588545407782912	2016-02-02T18:29:48	zrok_ And I think it's crazy to write about her as if she's a shoo-in. She's got tons of advantages and many disadvantages. They both do!
rtraister	694588429686939649	2016-02-02T18:29:21	zrok_ Oh gosh, I also don't think I painted her as an underdog. I've just never believed she was inevitable.
rtraister	694588189781131264	2016-02-02T18:28:23	scottros thanks, Scott!
rtraister	694586200515047424	2016-02-02T18:20:29	zrok_ I don't think I was arguing that it matters more. I think I was just arguing that it matters.
rtraister	694584452090036226	2016-02-02T18:13:32	zrok_ Your case, that my piece was not persuasive to you, is also strong! I accept your criticism and am grateful for the conversation.
rtraister	694584353087737856	2016-02-02T18:13:09	zrok_ I feel like that case is pretty strong.
rtraister	694584310427435008	2016-02-02T18:12:59	zrok_ What evidence? That we've never had a viable female pres candidate who was a revolutionary in 200+ years &amp; we don't have one now.
rtraister	694583487660212226	2016-02-02T18:09:42	anatinsly I understand &amp; respect critiques of HRC's record. This was a piece re her self-presentation. It doesn't invalidate other critique
rtraister	694583031999434752	2016-02-02T18:07:54	anatinsly You pointed out the words you object to. To me, they're acknowledgment of double standard and gender bias, not victimhood.
rtraister	694582653304115205	2016-02-02T18:06:23	anatinsly But I didn't write "rather than." Of course they stem from real issues, didn't suggest otherwise. They ALSO are shaped by gender.
rtraister	694582313099890688	2016-02-02T18:05:02	zrok_ and be a viable candidate (see above sentence) for president in 2016? Yep. Can never be "a leftist?" No, didn't say that.
rtraister	694581774698024960	2016-02-02T18:02:54	anatinsly JessicaValenti Or should we just not describe or acknowledge them?
rtraister	694581649913335808	2016-02-02T18:02:24	anatinsly JessicaValenti Is every acknowledgement of (real) double standards a claim of victimhood? Are gendered stereotypes not real?
rtraister	694581222442418176	2016-02-02T18:00:42	curtmark59 lovehealmymind makes her more appealing. It would be different if she were actually running, exhibiting that desire.
rtraister	694581120227282947	2016-02-02T18:00:18	curtmark59 lovehealmymind stems from her strategizing around her ambition for the presidency. That Warren seems to lack that
rtraister	694581003860467716	2016-02-02T17:59:50	curtmark59 lovehealmymind Also, it matters that Warren seem not to WANT to be pres, and HRC does. Some of what we criticize most in HRC
rtraister	694580865276493824	2016-02-02T17:59:17	curtmark59 lovehealmymind Also as a woman I think Warren would have gotten hit harder on lack of foreign policy experience than Bernie has
rtraister	694580769898008577	2016-02-02T17:58:54	curtmark59 lovehealmymind Same with HRC who's been a cool hero to some when she's NOT running, but as soon as she competes, things change
rtraister	694580631536340993	2016-02-02T17:58:21	curtmark59 lovehealmymind inauthentic, elite, a bad campaigner. Her electrifying speeches went viral before &amp; after campaign, not during.
rtraister	694580416360112128	2016-02-02T17:57:30	curtmark59 lovehealmymind But I believe she would have faced related obstacles. When she ran in Massachusetts, she was tagged as wooden
rtraister	694580305680842752	2016-02-02T17:57:04	curtmark59 I've been addressing Eliz Warren point in my replies. I agree I wish Warren had run:  lovehealmymind
rtraister	694579722982940672	2016-02-02T17:54:45	curtmark59 csittenfeld All fair critiques. Not suggesting they're invalid. Just trying to offer gender context for public presentation
rtraister	694579258061119488	2016-02-02T17:52:54	parallelcircle this is what my argument was. Not that she's hiding her revolutionary light under a bushel.
rtraister	694578955546918912	2016-02-02T17:51:42	parallelcircle Though I do think there are some pretty revolutionary things she IS saying, right now (re: Hyde--a big deal)
rtraister	694578861586190341	2016-02-02T17:51:19	parallelcircle I didn't mean to suggest that she's a crypto-revolutionary.
rtraister	694578641443885056	2016-02-02T17:50:27	zrok_ Nope. Didn't say that anywhere here.
rtraister	694578508098592770	2016-02-02T17:49:55	melsil rtraister gmail
rtraister	694578441585332224	2016-02-02T17:49:39	JustLikeACoward roqchams JessicaValenti Not an excuse for who she is Consideration of how gender plays into career of an anomalous figure
rtraister	694578175393861632	2016-02-02T17:48:36	JustLikeACoward roqchams JessicaValenti Nope. It's an examination of dynamics that led her to become who she is, which I do a lot.
rtraister	694577689093627904	2016-02-02T17:46:40	osselot JessicaValenti Not at all! Nothing here suggests that critiques of her are invalid.
rtraister	694577292400525312	2016-02-02T17:45:05	parallelcircle roqchams JessicaValenti It's just an examination of gender dynamics in political self-presentation.
rtraister	694577163853533184	2016-02-02T17:44:35	parallelcircle roqchams JessicaValenti Nope. It's not an accusation that anyone's sexist for not supporting anyone, actually.
rtraister	694576973864108032	2016-02-02T17:43:49	sfer222 well I would hope that she would! But she did get dinged hard for being a Harvard elite professor, etc..
rtraister	694576792124964864	2016-02-02T17:43:06	curtmark59 csittenfeld It doesn't excuse her choices, or fully explain them, but you can't understand her w/o taking gender into account
rtraister	694576575539494912	2016-02-02T17:42:14	curtmark59 csittenfeld She's the only woman ever to get this close to being president; her gender is tied up in who she is.
rtraister	694576194151436288	2016-02-02T17:40:43	kevinkresse indeed, part of my point is that she is NOT a revolutionary.
rtraister	694575971123531776	2016-02-02T17:39:50	anatinsly JessicaValenti Clearly you disagree strongly w my assessment &amp; I respect that! But disagreement doesn't invalidate the project.
rtraister	694575614049832963	2016-02-02T17:38:25	anatinsly JessicaValenti which is a) my job and b) a fair and reasonable project in a country that's never elected a woman.
rtraister	694575299422507008	2016-02-02T17:37:10	anatinsly JessicaValenti I don't think I'm painting anyone as "victim." I'm offering gendered context of woman running for president
rtraister	694574799323009025	2016-02-02T17:35:11	azeegs kadarlikeradar All of this is so true.
rtraister	694574163697254401	2016-02-02T17:32:39	lovehealmymind But short answer is: I wish she'd run, but I don't actually think she'd wholly escape related traps.
rtraister	694574044327329792	2016-02-02T17:32:11	lovehealmymind If you look at my recent replies you'll see my thoughts on this ad nauseum!
rtraister	694573779817762816	2016-02-02T17:31:08	sfer222 Alas it seems we won't know...
rtraister	694573714545983490	2016-02-02T17:30:52	sfer222 emilynussbaum So while I'd love to have seen her run, I don't think assumption that she would have been treated better is right.
rtraister	694573524577550338	2016-02-02T17:30:07	sfer222 emilynussbaum She hasn't strategized and contorted in way HRC has, in part because HRC HAS wanted to be president.
rtraister	694573413311123456	2016-02-02T17:29:40	sfer222 emilynussbaum &amp; I think the fact that she doesn't seem to WANT to be president makes her much more appealing than HRC to many.
rtraister	694573250781773824	2016-02-02T17:29:02	sfer222 emilynussbaum Also I think that as a woman she would have been hit much harder by now on lack of foreign policy experience.
rtraister	694573153469779969	2016-02-02T17:28:38	sfer222 emilynussbaum she was tagged as inauthentic, wooden, elite, a bad campaigner, lots of same charges leveled at HRC.
rtraister	694573071303364610	2016-02-02T17:28:19	sfer222 emilynussbaum But I also think that if she had, she would have faced related gender challenges. Recall that when she RAN in MA
rtraister	694572949764980736	2016-02-02T17:27:50	sfer222 emilynussbaum I've been responding to others who've argued this. I wish that EW had challenged HRC: 
rtraister	694572725017432064	2016-02-02T17:26:56	YeaYouRite As creative as when I publicly pleaded for her (&amp; other women) to challenge Hillary in the primary? 
rtraister	694572227749089281	2016-02-02T17:24:58	@ButtPatterson JessicaValenti They are not viable presidential candidates (would that they were!) This is exactly my point.
rtraister	694571371880382464	2016-02-02T17:21:34	BajaAZ4Bernie grgdwyr Wind2Energy JessicaValenti And I wish Elizabeth Warren were running for president. She's not though.
rtraister	694571169836601349	2016-02-02T17:20:46	Wind2Energy jarrodmyrick ZephyrTeachout JessicaValenti Glad to hear it!
rtraister	694571049371959296	2016-02-02T17:20:17	NewsConnoisseur JessicaValenti She's also not running for president.
rtraister	694570939195990016	2016-02-02T17:19:51	JustLikeACoward roqchams JessicaValenti That's why I'm not arguing that it makes her politics any better, just that it might be true.
rtraister	694569529217826816	2016-02-02T17:14:14	anatinsly JessicaValenti Sort of exactly my point!
rtraister	694569384476540929	2016-02-02T17:13:40	kadarlikeradar azeegs But I also think that she would have bumped up into many obstacles related to the ones Hillary has faced.
rtraister	694569264515260418	2016-02-02T17:13:11	kadarlikeradar azeegs Believe me, I also wish that EW had challenged Clinton. I've said so loudly here: 
rtraister	694569202674462720	2016-02-02T17:12:57	kadarlikeradar azeegs Which means she hasn't contorted and strategized the way HRC, who DOES want to be president, has.
rtraister	694569142414876673	2016-02-02T17:12:42	kadarlikeradar azeegs Also, I think one of the reasons EW is so appealing to so many is because she doesn't seem to WANT to be president
rtraister	694569070822346753	2016-02-02T17:12:25	kadarlikeradar azeegs It's easier to cheer women, including both HRC and EW, when they are in jobs, not competing in elections
rtraister	694568954052894720	2016-02-02T17:11:57	kadarlikeradar azeegs she was criticized, like Hillary, for being wooden, inauthentic, remote, elite and a bad campaigner.
rtraister	694568867503411201	2016-02-02T17:11:37	kadarlikeradar azeegs I also think that even though we think of loving her for fiery speeches, when she was actually CAMPAIGNING
rtraister	694568794694492160	2016-02-02T17:11:19	kadarlikeradar azeegs I think she as a woman would get hit a lot harder on lack of foreign policy experience.
rtraister	694568727363371008	2016-02-02T17:11:03	kadarlikeradar azeegs I've been replying to others raising the same point, which is fair, but disagree that you can sub in EW for Bernie
rtraister	694568126919397376	2016-02-02T17:08:40	biettetimmons earnest, rude, angry, you know...my replies are a veritable rainbow of grumpiness!
rtraister	694567910065463297	2016-02-02T17:07:48	EricMGarcia So those are my thoughts. Twitterfied.
rtraister	694567876297097220	2016-02-02T17:07:40	EricMGarcia That doesn't excuse the contortions, just saying that Warren's LACK of presidential drive helps keep her more appealing.
rtraister	694567790091636737	2016-02-02T17:07:20	EricMGarcia So much of what people dislike in HRC is product of her strategizing how to get into this unlikely role: plausible woman pres.
rtraister	694567657929084930	2016-02-02T17:06:48	EricMGarcia That makes sense! &amp; means she hasn't had to contort or fundraise or strategize in ways that HRC, who DOES want to be pres, has.
rtraister	694567522528526337	2016-02-02T17:06:16	EricMGarcia Also, I think it makes a real difference that part of why we (reasonably!) love Warren is bc she seems not to WANT to be pres.
rtraister	694567442476068864	2016-02-02T17:05:57	EricMGarcia Also, I think she, as a woman, would have been hit harder already on foreign policy experience than Bernie has been.
rtraister	694567358401220608	2016-02-02T17:05:37	EricMGarcia But when she's running she's unlikeable, wooden, a bad campaigner. Warren was tagged as same during her campaign.
rtraister	694567277354680321	2016-02-02T17:05:18	EricMGarcia Women's rights are human rights, texts from Hillary badass when at State, regularly voted most admire woman in US
rtraister	694567157712183296	2016-02-02T17:04:49	EricMGarcia Easier to find women inspiring when they're not in threatening, competitive races against men. HRC too:
rtraister	694566968628764672	2016-02-02T17:04:04	EricMGarcia We think of how we love her fiery speeches, and we do! But they were largely before and after her actual CAMPAIGN.
rtraister	694566852664623104	2016-02-02T17:03:36	EricMGarcia But I'm not sure that her road would have been like Bernie's; I think she would have faced gender related challenges he hasn't.
rtraister	694566645147291648	2016-02-02T17:02:47	EricMGarcia Sorry for delay. So. I was very open about my wish that Warren run: 
rtraister	694566071165128704	2016-02-02T17:00:30	theqeld JessicaValenti All popular enough to make viable runs for the presidency!
rtraister	694565602065780736	2016-02-02T16:58:38	jsende You know, I enjoy setting little goals for myself. Also, I like to talk to people. Even people who are very grumpy.
rtraister	694565325652779008	2016-02-02T16:57:32	pblest Well as I said, I was all for it! 
rtraister	694556805511409666	2016-02-02T16:23:41	EricMGarcia on phone right now, but I've been addressing this this morning in my replies...more soon.
rtraister	694555951190405122	2016-02-02T16:20:17	pblest tactic that is harder for women to deploy on a political stage. I'm not aiming to tell a complete story of their pros/cons.
rtraister	694555811717193728	2016-02-02T16:19:44	pblest My piece isn't questioning Sanders' very real appeals! Insofar as it's about him, it's about his ability to deploy a rhetorical
rtraister	694554559205740544	2016-02-02T16:14:45	SnowballWhale TNCTerlizzi JessicaValenti sorry, no. But a writer is always happy to provoke such passionate response! Have a great day.
rtraister	694554154681892865	2016-02-02T16:13:09	dburns7499 Part of argument is that it's been so hard for women to be loved as passionately angry/revolutionaries that few have tried.
rtraister	694553957683826688	2016-02-02T16:12:22	The mornings you vow to respond to all of your overtired, deeply impassioned Twitter-replies are the best mornings.
rtraister	694553098698760192	2016-02-02T16:08:57	HeerJeet pblest She would get hit MUCH harder for it, I'm sure.
rtraister	694552801620463616	2016-02-02T16:07:46	dburns7499 JessicaValenti well, that's part of my point, I think...
rtraister	694552677016059905	2016-02-02T16:07:17	aaronpmarks JamilSmith Well, in part because she's not doing well. I wrote plenty about Palin in 08.
rtraister	694552562268270592	2016-02-02T16:06:49	DougHenwood saraeckel Other people willfully mischaracterizing a piece re HRC/Bernie?! Strong argument for your own mischaracterization.
rtraister	694551990781743104	2016-02-02T16:04:33	pblest but also what makes her the candidate, right? Anyway. I don't think we know answer, but I don't think it's a simple counteractual.
rtraister	694551890114248704	2016-02-02T16:04:09	pblest HRC's ambition to be president, &amp;strategizing toward it, is part of what makes her so UNappealing...
rtraister	694551659612078081	2016-02-02T16:03:14	pblest Plus there's fact that 1 of reasons she's not running seems to be that she doesn't WANT to be president, which makes her appealing!
rtraister	694551515747479552	2016-02-02T16:02:40	pblest Fiery speeches have been since election. When she was IN a campaign, she was critiqued as wooden, inauthentic, a bad campaigner.
rtraister	694551318707441664	2016-02-02T16:01:53	pblest For ex: Warren's moments of viral popularity didn't really come while she was campaigning. The you didn't build that was before.
rtraister	694551221319929856	2016-02-02T16:01:29	pblest there're differences in how we treat women when they're in forward threatening motion versus when they're static, in jobs.
rtraister	694551096275161089	2016-02-02T16:01:00	pblest Also, we think of her as a yelling heroine of the left, but...
rtraister	694550859909337088	2016-02-02T16:00:03	pblest I think she'd face some challenges related to HRC's challenges-my guess is she'd get hit harder than Bernie on foreign policy.
rtraister	694550506128195584	2016-02-02T15:58:39	pblest But I don't think it's as easy as subbing Warren for Sanders (or Clinton), for a couple of reasons.
rtraister	694550332941144064	2016-02-02T15:57:58	pblest I don't directly dismiss it. I think there's a possibility she could be doing as well &amp; wrote a piece last year hoping she'd run.
rtraister	694549685609107456	2016-02-02T15:55:23	jarrodmyrick JessicaValenti why are you obsessed with bros?
rtraister	694543587166523392	2016-02-02T15:31:09	overlayered JamilSmith Nope, it's actually not about that at all.
rtraister	694543285193461760	2016-02-02T15:29:57	slow_soft_late No, others have been confused. I filed at 2 am! It probably could have been clearer. My oof.
rtraister	694542913028648962	2016-02-02T15:28:29	staceynewman Of course it matters, but if this is about wording in my piece, it was because it was a tie when I filed.
rtraister	694542496978845697	2016-02-02T15:26:49	chaosprime ManWithoutPants Jeevesmeister Except for literally not everybody and she's not running for president. But I wish she had!
rtraister	694542203700580355	2016-02-02T15:25:39	DougHenwood Well, no one's using that line here, especially saraeckel who I believe is a strong Bernie supporter.
rtraister	694541932874354688	2016-02-02T15:24:35	DikaiosLogos Agree re some of above, disagree re some. Your critiques are valid! Not challenging them. Just offering gender context.
rtraister	694541217707757568	2016-02-02T15:21:44	dougom jbouie this is kind of what my piece today is about 
rtraister	694541050283687936	2016-02-02T15:21:04	slow_soft_late sentence before says she could NEVER be these things; i..e she couldn't have been a revolutionary (&amp; viable pres candidate)
rtraister	694540469502623744	2016-02-02T15:18:46	Well, two hundred plus years of history support that assumption. But other than that, sure, I'm speculating.  
rtraister	694539818257219585	2016-02-02T15:16:11	DikaiosLogos saraeckel I'm not suggesting that dislike of her is invalid! Just trying to put some of her history/problems in context.
rtraister	694539531241013250	2016-02-02T15:15:02	DikaiosLogos Warren appears not to WANT to be president, and strategizes less around it, which makes her much more appealing.
rtraister	694539457169616898	2016-02-02T15:14:45	DikaiosLogos less, different, I don't think we can say. Also much of what HRC is blamed for are contortions she made to become presidential
rtraister	694538765071749120	2016-02-02T15:12:00	staceynewman it was a tie when I went to bed!
rtraister	694532749932249089	2016-02-02T14:48:06	KnowWorkNoMoney I'm afraid you've misread my piece. Its point is that she could never have done so &amp; been a viable candidate.
rtraister	694509547520528386	2016-02-02T13:15:54	Mmm, this election offers so many different dimensions of dread and fear and despair to savor! A truly rich, complex flavor profile.
rtraister	694508920488927233	2016-02-02T13:13:24	Then again, I think we all underestimate how much most Americans - men &amp; women - loathe and distrust women.
rtraister	694508457983025152	2016-02-02T13:11:34	Me to my stepson: "You don't remember this, but when really idealistic, outspoken, awkward Democrats run, it really never ends well."
rtraister	694507013653426176	2016-02-02T13:05:50	Older voters worry abt Bernie bec. they remember the many, many times an honest, awkward Democrat has lost to a smooth-talking war lord.
rtraister	694372488956915712	2016-02-02T04:11:16	Tonight makes both Bernie and Hillary better candidates and folks some of you need to get a grip if we're gonna make it thru this thing
rtraister	694528726558703616	2016-02-02T14:32:06	pescami TheCut So they threaten less by dint of their individual identities.
rtraister	694528358282084352	2016-02-02T14:30:38	pescami TheCut because for the most part, while their IDENTITIES threaten the status quo/power structure, their policies don't.
rtraister	694525983337091072	2016-02-02T14:21:12	saraeckel Well, look, I NEVER thought I'd hear a female candidate talking about repealing Hyde! Never in my life. So I've seen that now.
rtraister	694525611084226560	2016-02-02T14:19:44	saraeckel Me too. And no matter what, as jbouie and mattyglesias have argued, this forces party to recalibrate=this is great.
rtraister	694525173437980675	2016-02-02T14:17:59	saraeckel DEFINITELY. Also why Edwards could be more prog in 08 than the black guy or the woman, already considered radical by dint of IDs.
rtraister	694520110531362818	2016-02-02T13:57:52	"This is a paradigm; it’s why Mom is the disciplinarian and Dad is the fun guy."  
rtraister	694524829878349824	2016-02-02T14:16:37	DikaiosLogos saraeckel There is no "if male" HRC. HRC is who she is in part bc she's been formed by being a woman in a male world.
rtraister	694524543373832192	2016-02-02T14:15:29	DikaiosLogos She's not, however, running for president. And if she were, she'd bump into a lot of related roadblocks.
rtraister	694524192616767494	2016-02-02T14:14:05	saraeckel This is old, knotty stuff constraining which figures get to play which kinds of parts. Exciting that Bernie gets to be Bernie btw
rtraister	694523909392220160	2016-02-02T14:12:58	saraeckel My point always is only that it's more complex that the basic storylines (in either direction) permit us to see easily.
rtraister	694523795940450304	2016-02-02T14:12:31	saraeckel I think that all that's happening is ultimately good for those who care about econ inequality, feminism &amp; a lefter Dem party.
rtraister	694523500942508032	2016-02-02T14:11:20	saraeckel sure! Part of what's happening is that she's part of altering these paradigms. There's been an enormous amount of change.
rtraister	694518376069218304	2016-02-02T13:50:59	saraeckel again, that doesn't damn them! it just makes it harder.
rtraister	694518303864295425	2016-02-02T13:50:41	saraeckel a lot of it is that we still see women selling themselves for a big job as fundamentally unnatural, thus performative.
rtraister	694516470668197888	2016-02-02T13:43:24	saraeckel I do think she could have won. But I think we fool ourselves if we think she would have escaped some of HRC snares.
rtraister	694516323884343296	2016-02-02T13:42:49	saraeckel And we forget that when she was RUNNING in Mass, she too was called inauthentic, wooden, unlikable, a bad campaigner.
rtraister	694516211678322688	2016-02-02T13:42:23	saraeckel I think she would have been hit on foreign policy harder than Bernie has been.
rtraister	694515973240537088	2016-02-02T13:41:26	saraeckel Though honestly, I think she would have faced MANY related (if different, because she's different) challenges.
rtraister	694515824535691265	2016-02-02T13:40:50	saraeckel Oh, I wanted that so badly! 
rtraister	694514182650208256	2016-02-02T13:34:19	In Iowa, Hillary shows she's learned something about running while female, by rtraister:  
rtraister	694513093167206400	2016-02-02T13:29:59	And actually being outside the party, etc. Not saying it's the only factor!  
rtraister	694446208794935296	2016-02-02T09:04:13	Me on Hillary in Iowa and being the lady pragmatist--tonight vs this weekend vs 2008: 
rtraister	694431274694545408	2016-02-02T08:04:52	Before I finally sleep, I cannot recommend this jbouie take on tonight strongly enough. I agree &amp; agree &amp; agree: 
rtraister	694400462242615296	2016-02-02T06:02:26	We are in serious you-had-one-job territory.
rtraister	694387149970489344	2016-02-02T05:09:32	BlueBoxDave With a strong speech I thought.
rtraister	694387113643606016	2016-02-02T05:09:23	BlueBoxDave I think it was smart. She got earlier viewers, stepped on Cruz and also stepped on the weird victory report.
rtraister	694386421570916352	2016-02-02T05:06:38	I think Andrea Mitchell is walking back the victory declaration news. But I'm not sure.
rtraister	694376200274202624	2016-02-02T04:26:01	Ted Cruz: "Morning is coming!" And there will be no morning after pill with it! OwnIt IowaCaucus
rtraister	694379058461671424	2016-02-02T04:37:23	And that, my friends, is why Bernie Sanders matters.
rtraister	694378793775968258	2016-02-02T04:36:20	20 years, 8 days ago: "The era of big government is over." - Bill Clinton  Tonight: "I am a progressive." - Hillary Clinton
rtraister	694382450735194116	2016-02-02T04:50:51	Both HRC and Bernie energetic and upbeat. This is a good night for Democrats. And Democratic socialists.
rtraister	694382193997660160	2016-02-02T04:49:50	That is a happy, happy looking Bernie!
rtraister	694377589230714880	2016-02-02T04:31:32	"I know we can finish the job of universal health care coverage for every many woman and child." Someone got the memo.
rtraister	694376988790910976	2016-02-02T04:29:09	This was either a terrible move or a major power move, cutting over Cruz's speech.
rtraister	694376509390372864	2016-02-02T04:27:15	"An courageous conservatives said 'Yes we can!'" Exhausted husband: "Did he just steal that?"

rtraister	693109874901671936	2016-01-29T16:34:06	For example. Does this sound familiar?  
rtraister	693109678021091328	2016-01-29T16:33:19	I think the actual shape of her 2012 campaign suggests that Warren would face similar criticism about authenticity and tone.
rtraister	693109485179506688	2016-01-29T16:32:33	One thing I really want to push against is the idea that things would be different if it were Elizabeth Warren and not HRC.
rtraister	693108803110199296	2016-01-29T16:29:50	So, here's the thing. Warren's authenticity *was* questioned in her 2012 campaign. 
rtraister	693105183501324288	2016-01-29T16:15:27	Sanders' authenticity—his style, or lack thereof—is a part of his appeal, &amp; I'm not sure that was possible for HRC.

rtraister	688933460648550400	2016-01-18T03:58:31	gabrielsnyder Fair enough, but my point is that he's been the subject of 3 debate questions over 4 debates &amp; repro rights have been 0.

rtraister	688930260281376768	2016-01-18T03:45:48	Or, as others point out, re Flint or labor or drone strikes. But please, does anyone else have anything they want to say about Bill Clinton?
