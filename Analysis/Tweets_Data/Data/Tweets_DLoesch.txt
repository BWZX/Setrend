DLoesch	723337247496359936	2016-04-22T02:26:53	HJovey Wrong. State law blocked forced acceptance and empowered business to make their own choices on the issue without penalty.
DLoesch	723336940196499456	2016-04-22T02:25:40	Conservative constitutionalists aren’t big on empowering the government, be it state or fed, to regulate acceptance or private biz.
DLoesch	723335854723227648	2016-04-22T02:21:21	So apparently forced acceptance and business rights are states’s rights issues. Goodness.

DLoesch	723335071621484544	2016-04-22T02:18:14	Whether it’s the federal government or the state, he’s still arguing for gov’t to force acceptance and dictate private business.
DLoesch	723334830549655552	2016-04-22T02:17:17	When all else fails, say the states can decide! But it’s still gov’t administering forced acceptance. Bad answer.

DLoesch	705238859681042432	2016-03-03T03:50:21	If you dislike Rubio bcse he cozied up to estab, fine say that, but disingenuous to excoriate him for doing what you praise Trump for doing.
DLoesch	705237049281007616	2016-03-03T03:43:09	Rubio is just doing what Trump has been doing these past several months. I thought those people love political incorrectness.
DLoesch	705236196436353024	2016-03-03T03:39:46	_ashnicole93_ Actually it was after he flirted with campaigns before. I think what you do in public life before politics is important, too.

DLoesch	701994767035465728	2016-02-23T04:59:29	AndrewRSchwartz If true, doesn’t seem as bad as this
