Chris_arnade	726245380329971712	2016-04-30T03:02:46	19. Pps: I just forgot this pic. Was supposed to be 11 I think 
Chris_arnade	726244691801419777	2016-04-30T03:00:02	ettaroo oh joy. I am still waiting to hear from him on my debate offer. I will meet him in any bar in US of his  choosing.
Chris_arnade	726244447948836864	2016-04-30T02:59:04	johnedwinmason yep. That is kind of his mojo isn't it. Like he just doesn't get it, in a well intentioned way though
Chris_arnade	726243176252579841	2016-04-30T02:54:00	And isn't that what us snarky folks usually bitch about? Not being intellectually flexible?
Chris_arnade	726242699406393345	2016-04-30T02:52:07	I kind of get the snark, but of all the pundits, David Brooks seems the mostly genuinely concerned about what he got wrong, and why.
Chris_arnade	726241668555497472	2016-04-30T02:48:01	I welcome David Brooks' (nytdavidbrooks) shift of focus to shit beyond DC/NYC. Maybe join me on May 12th in Many La for BassMaster tourney!
Chris_arnade	726239337466175488	2016-04-30T02:38:45	jamiepastore I don't believe the writer understands finance
Chris_arnade	726238588044718080	2016-04-30T02:35:46	jamiepastore I couldn't understand it either. Other than it saying hedge funds are evil, just because.
Chris_arnade	726231272759111680	2016-04-30T02:06:42	They once did?  
Chris_arnade	726230482078326784	2016-04-30T02:03:34	jamiepastore Ask mattyglesias  Either way, idea that hedge funds need to be eliminated is nuts. Trolling or not.
Chris_arnade	726229284386430978	2016-04-30T01:58:48	This is pretty much nuts.  
Chris_arnade	726222608690192384	2016-04-30T01:32:17	ninarobertsnyc Thank you. I miss my crazy nights at weird places in NYC. I am too old to stay out beyond midnight now. And drink.
Chris_arnade	726219297329176576	2016-04-30T01:19:07	meleaseward Lost in my confusion. Lost lost lost. This can be it. 
Chris_arnade	726219148414562304	2016-04-30T01:18:32	ericbeebo How does one podcast?
Chris_arnade	726218599803834368	2016-04-30T01:16:21	ericbeebo georgepearkes Oh San antonio! I should probably go back sometime soon. Been awhile.
Chris_arnade	726218374133501952	2016-04-30T01:15:27	18. PS: Despite her many attempts, &amp; charms, I did not go home with my "girlfriend". She did get me to dance though 
Chris_arnade	726215008670081024	2016-04-30T01:02:05	17. And that is NYC. A place that can have an amazing bar, that almost nobody knows about, but is central to a few 
Chris_arnade	726214592834207744	2016-04-30T01:00:26	16. The newer bars keep coming, and coming, and La Cueva Clasica Antillana is no more. 
Chris_arnade	726214439297503232	2016-04-30T00:59:49	15. And after 50 years, that was that. 
Chris_arnade	726214285534330881	2016-04-30T00:59:12	14. Then in 2011 I came and it was locked. Eviction notices taped to the door. I believe tax issues. 
Chris_arnade	726213966863687681	2016-04-30T00:57:56	13. One regular really liked me. Really really. After 2 am should would offer to take me home. 
Chris_arnade	726213801197076480	2016-04-30T00:57:17	12.I came regularly, enough that they called me Mr Presidente, and always had one ready for me. 
Chris_arnade	726213485680545796	2016-04-30T00:56:02	10.Safety was never an issue. Except perhaps from a fire. I was assured by owner a NYC fire marshal was a regular 
Chris_arnade	726213162429759492	2016-04-30T00:54:44	9. The music was mostly just locals having fun. But serious about their music 
Chris_arnade	726212989788012544	2016-04-30T00:54:03	8. There was an older man who came only to dance (well, until 4 am at least) 
Chris_arnade	726212822686945281	2016-04-30T00:53:23	7. Almost everyone was a regular who had been coming for years, who all stayed till 4 am. 
Chris_arnade	726212618923433984	2016-04-30T00:52:35	6. His wife ran the bar. 
Chris_arnade	726212485334884353	2016-04-30T00:52:03	5.I stayed till 4 am. That night and many others. The club had been around for 50 years. The owner was also the DJ 
Chris_arnade	726212258079096832	2016-04-30T00:51:09	4.  Of course, I had to go. After being frisked by the bouncer, I entered a room filled with dancing. And very friendly older folks.
Chris_arnade	726212112280866816	2016-04-30T00:50:34	3. When I asked the bartender at the newish bar, he said, “That place is awful. Dangerous. Stabbings. We have called the police on them
Chris_arnade	726211982605561856	2016-04-30T00:50:03	2. Between sets loud salsa music was coming from outside. I tracked it to a low-slung dingy corner bar, called La Cueva Clasica Antillana
Chris_arnade	726211767148367872	2016-04-30T00:49:12	1. A tiny NYC story. In 08 I was waiting to watch a friends band at a newish bar in East Williamsburg, a hood that was quickly gentrifying.

Chris_arnade	726189849728946177	2016-04-29T23:22:06	quantian1 abelolisted That market will swing lower at some point in election. Because markets. But static buy/hold, that is my market
Chris_arnade	726189667972993024	2016-04-29T23:21:23	quantian1 abelolisted my overall General market is Hillary 80-85 (payout at 100 if she wins).
Chris_arnade	726188813291245569	2016-04-29T23:17:59	abelolisted You can hack it, since they half of every group! I think college-educated whites drop to 46%R and 65% turnout. quantian1

Chris_arnade	726186393186136064	2016-04-29T23:08:22	quantian1 abelolisted Point is, even assuming huge white working class tilt prior to past elections, he still gets crushed
Chris_arnade	726186172955906048	2016-04-29T23:07:30	quantian1 abelolisted Here is my best guess with a pro Trump bias (PS: fun tool to use)   
Chris_arnade	726179074222231552	2016-04-29T22:39:17	My one-eyed spring peeper (Pip), is fitting in well in her new home 
Chris_arnade	726151593096318976	2016-04-29T20:50:05	I believe the Scooby-do van has been repainted and now used as work van in Bronx 
Chris_arnade	726140250943279105	2016-04-29T20:05:01	conorsen Birmingham is just a great city. Old steel town. Great architecture. Good location. Not too hilly to make hard to get around
Chris_arnade	726139870255669248	2016-04-29T20:03:30	conorsen too different in my mind. Birmingham &amp; chat. are Appalachian industrial towns-- smaller Pittsburghs. Asheville is more retirement
Chris_arnade	726138362088837120	2016-04-29T19:57:31	conorsen I will be there in week. I prefer Montgomery (one of my all time fav cities), but I am odd in my taste. I recommend both to anyone

Chris_arnade	725847497583779840	2016-04-29T00:41:43	johnlingan Wow. I have been noodling with exploring more Pigeon forge, the creation of the Smoky park, and Dolly Parton.

Chris_arnade	725838400734019584	2016-04-29T00:05:34	14. My next six months will be focused on rural poverty. Places like Yazoo MS, Grundy VA. Where folks are cut off. 
Chris_arnade	725837160646086656	2016-04-29T00:00:39	13. I felt guilty leaving. Grabbing a pic, and moving on. Moving moving. They of course, just went back to playing 
Chris_arnade	725836708269412353	2016-04-28T23:58:51	12. I let them use my camera, and it was whisked away. This picture of me came out of it 
Chris_arnade	725836034651635713	2016-04-28T23:56:10	11. Rural poverty is the most damning. The community structure that once gave folks meaning, is dying   out 
Chris_arnade	725835430168530944	2016-04-28T23:53:46	10. The kid with the dog insisted another shot. He didn't like the first. "My dog is better than that." 
Chris_arnade	725835183891595266	2016-04-28T23:52:47	9. I could of been from another damn country, what with being white, interested, and with a big ass camera. 
Chris_arnade	725834707645112321	2016-04-28T23:50:54	8. It was impossible for me to leave that street. Every child demanded I take their pics. 
Chris_arnade	725834397925126144	2016-04-28T23:49:40	7. Pride wasn't gone. This child ran into house and appeared with his dog. He demanded I take his picture with it 
Chris_arnade	725833611556036608	2016-04-28T23:46:32	6. The distance to any opportunity, was some of the greatest I have seen. The Bronx has Manhattan. Yazoo. Nothing 
Chris_arnade	725833000559206401	2016-04-28T23:44:07	5. The adults as well. They wanted to talk. To be photographed. And to tell their story 
Chris_arnade	725832803250741248	2016-04-28T23:43:20	4. They wouldn't let me leave. All asking to be made "famous".  "Nobody ever comes to Yazoo. Not a TV man like you" 
Chris_arnade	725832417668386817	2016-04-28T23:41:48	3. Kids treated me like a rock star. They wanted to have their pictures taken, and they surrounded me. 
Chris_arnade	725832124130033664	2016-04-28T23:40:38	2. I spent time in Yazoo City, a town of 10,000. Often when I show up with my camera, I encounter cynicism. Not in Yazoo.
Chris_arnade	725831748198776832	2016-04-28T23:39:08	1. I see a lot of poverty in the US, because there is a lot to see, and I seek it out. Some of the worst is rural Mississippi

Chris_arnade	725704670988099585	2016-04-28T15:14:11	14. Despite the 54.90 offer. They claimed put triggered. We claimed no. Kid of course just wanted to vomit.
Chris_arnade	725704378443816960	2016-04-28T15:13:01	13. Because it was our hedge, and because you defend your fucking barrier man. Regardless, they had a friend lift a 55.25 offer
Chris_arnade	725704164072914944	2016-04-28T15:12:10	12. Their barrier was 55 (Still remember it 20 years later). Price got to like 54.75 - 55.0. We of course put a 54.90 offer for size up.
Chris_arnade	725703759557484546	2016-04-28T15:10:33	11. They did this in illiquid market, from 4 dealers at same time (claiming exclusivity. Right). They then started buying the underlying.
Chris_arnade	725703565046599680	2016-04-28T15:09:47	10. For the geeks, here is how the hedge fund trade worked. They bought huge up and in puts, with barrier 7 points above market &amp; strike
Chris_arnade	725703125961728001	2016-04-28T15:08:02	9. No kids ever came to the trading floor again.   PS: The case JUST got settled in 2010. That kid just got hired by Goldman Sachs…
Chris_arnade	725702875209408513	2016-04-28T15:07:03	8. The trade with the hedge fund was eventually taken to court (they worked with brokers to have an above barrier price lifted).
Chris_arnade	725702598586732544	2016-04-28T15:05:57	7. Then he collapsed into the seat, crawled under the desk, and fell asleep. Meanwhile his father was getting absolutely hammered in market
Chris_arnade	725702360975155200	2016-04-28T15:05:00	6. He vomited all over the fucking desk. I mean all over. Sprayed everything. Was perfect timing, since the market was also getting hammered
Chris_arnade	725702113989382146	2016-04-28T15:04:01	5. We forgot about him, &amp; he busied himself spinning in the seat, slamming on the keyboard. Just a few seconds after the barrier got broken
Chris_arnade	725701870371610625	2016-04-28T15:03:03	4. As we were busy getting run over, and trying to defend a barrier, the kid had moved a few seats over, sitting at an old trading station.
Chris_arnade	725701558269296640	2016-04-28T15:01:49	3. It was a day a big hedge fund tried to squeeze everyone by buying huge size of illiquid up and in puts. Then ramping market up.
Chris_arnade	725701395442180096	2016-04-28T15:01:10	2. A guy in our group brought his 6 year old onto the trading floor. He assumed it would be a slow day. It wasn't

Chris_arnade	725493199385538560	2016-04-28T01:13:52	markowhich abelolisted So better to have "gifts" go directly into endowment and have that finance capital expenses
Chris_arnade	725492354199740416	2016-04-28T01:10:30	The endowment is the market based investment vehicle. The college the capital/human investment. Now is the time for capital investment
Chris_arnade	725491384833183745	2016-04-28T01:06:39	ericjweiner1 Right, but that is kind of my point. They are transferring from a market investment to a "human capital" investment.

Chris_arnade	725489091928793088	2016-04-28T00:57:33	georgepearkes m_c_klein  In addition, spending money spot has forward consequences. Harvard itself generates long term returns via alumni

Chris_arnade	724621660503052288	2016-04-25T15:30:41	abelolisted There certainly is a lot to be upset/smug about. It is a question of tactics vs strategy
Chris_arnade	724620489147187200	2016-04-25T15:26:02	Which comes back to question. If you had to construct one metric of "eliteness", It wouldn't be geography or wealth. It would be Education

Chris_arnade	724322889751777281	2016-04-24T19:43:28	LadyFOHF but across entire industry, weighted for assets under management. Based on that it is my sense fees have been high and sticky

Chris_arnade	724250375176511488	2016-04-24T14:55:20	10. Or this. Filling out welfare forms in a boring McDonalds (after washing up in the bathroom) 
Chris_arnade	724250168112099328	2016-04-24T14:54:30	9. This is much more the landscape of poverty than a dirt road. Waiting to shoot up in a boring McDonalds 
Chris_arnade	724249851026874368	2016-04-24T14:53:15	8. The blandness, and the lack of drama, is what can render poverty so much more painful. And easier to overlook.
Chris_arnade	724249237257609216	2016-04-24T14:50:48	7. More importantly, living in that ordinariness, increases the sense of removal, the disposability of their lives, and their role in life.
Chris_arnade	724248770104438784	2016-04-24T14:48:57	6. Yet that ordinariness, and staleness, is very very important. It adds to the emptiness that often comes with poverty.
Chris_arnade	724248586897203201	2016-04-24T14:48:13	5. Also low income housing, which is about as stale and undramatic as you can get. At least not stereotypically.
Chris_arnade	724248413454405633	2016-04-24T14:47:32	4. Reality is poverty, &amp; near poverty, plays out in rather boring and ordinary places. McDonalds. Walmarts. Places that visually are empty
Chris_arnade	724248094158774272	2016-04-24T14:46:16	3. But mostly it is in choice of settings: Falling down wood houses. Railroad tracks, empty lots. etc. I am certainly guilty of this.
Chris_arnade	724247603244879872	2016-04-24T14:44:19	2. Usually by over-contrasted B&amp;W pics. Matt Black example of this (PS: It a great project, regardless of that) 
Chris_arnade	724246867429744640	2016-04-24T14:41:23	1. What I find most frustrating with many works photographing poverty is how they render it "dramatic"

Chris_arnade	724238621209972736	2016-04-24T14:08:37	Still unanswered question of Wall Street today: why haven't hedge fund fees collapsed with competition/bad results

Chris_arnade	724221118186434563	2016-04-24T12:59:04	quantingaway Oh. I do pay. But when you have spent your days helping structure low-tax games for others. The game side of you kicks in

Chris_arnade	724210857039810560	2016-04-24T12:18:18	Bingo. Although on trading floors many more guys (always guys) loved/talk Wall Street. I never have seen it.  
Chris_arnade	724210470530502657	2016-04-24T12:16:46	Mistake. Bad poll. Left off Trading spaces.
Chris_arnade	724210169811447808	2016-04-24T12:15:34	I mean, pretty much since the movie came out (85?), our economy (and lesser degree culture) has been a version of revenge of the nerds

Chris_arnade	723865147182329858	2016-04-23T13:24:34	dzalcman Agree with all that! IMO though, the greatest imbalance in journalism right now is economic/cultural. Journalist are often elites!
Chris_arnade	723863022796722176	2016-04-23T13:16:08	spollck I like that phrasing. Exactly what is happening.

Chris_arnade	723852653223129088	2016-04-23T12:34:55	5. Am i dooming her to a now sexless boring life in tiny jar? Should I add her to much larger Terrarium (and probably lose track of her)
Chris_arnade	723852293318270976	2016-04-23T12:33:29	4. So I built a much  larger terrarium, &amp; put in all the frogs, except the one-eyed frog. Because she will get lost &amp; hard for her to feed
Chris_arnade	723851937825869824	2016-04-23T12:32:05	3. When the spring thaw occurred I added other spring peepers to jar. My one-eyed spring peeper was a female. Lots of frog sex happened
Chris_arnade	723851690705838080	2016-04-23T12:31:06	2. One year ago I found/rescued a one-eyed tiny spring peeper. I put in a jar. Feed crickets. Doing well.
Chris_arnade	723851511302893569	2016-04-23T12:30:23	1. Absurd animal ethics/behavior question (only for those who like silly ethics questions. And animal behaviorist)
Chris_arnade	723850721817464832	2016-04-23T12:27:15	_pratum as I said last night 
Chris_arnade	723850513608003584	2016-04-23T12:26:25	_pratum I think the contention is they didn't know it was Paulson, who helped them select assets. I may be wrong on that detail though
Chris_arnade	723845052217303041	2016-04-23T12:04:43	Especially relative to the clearly corrupt other things that were going on. Like rating agencies. Like accounting of exotic derivatives
Chris_arnade	723844820855341056	2016-04-23T12:03:48	That aside, these types of deals, like Abacus and another one with Magnetar, are odd cases to try and prosecute. IMO very little wrong done
Chris_arnade	723844551526481921	2016-04-23T12:02:44	The salient feature -- regardless of wrong doing, the S.E.C. didn't want to take on GS. They went into it with a seeming bias.
Chris_arnade	723844380415676416	2016-04-23T12:02:03	This article on Abacus deal, by eisingerj is great.   
Chris_arnade	723843455538061312	2016-04-23T11:58:22	After reading more ABOUT the abacus deal I should of said. Damn my ADD and small keyboard and not caring.

Chris_arnade	723721120071999488	2016-04-23T03:52:15	10. While trading desks, with bank board approval, were selling out of the money puts, and mismarking them, to collect year end bonuses?
Chris_arnade	723720289838895104	2016-04-23T03:48:57	9.  And this is what prosecutors have focused on. When rating agencies &amp; banks were snuggling tight, selling out everyone for big $'s
Chris_arnade	723719336049938432	2016-04-23T03:45:10	8. Abacus  deal: Two consenting trading desks engaging in a weird derivatives fetish. They found each other via the backpage of finance: GS
Chris_arnade	723718673706438656	2016-04-23T03:42:32	7. As a guy who saw so much blatant fraud &amp; corruption at the banks, sucks to watch prosecutors throw charges at minor shit that wasn't bad
Chris_arnade	723717500203073537	2016-04-23T03:37:52	6. They have only gone after cases that are well documented, regardless of the wrong doing. The Wall Street equivalent of hookers on corners
Chris_arnade	723717097482801154	2016-04-23T03:36:16	5. Same absurd focus on the trivial, and the headline grabbing, has played out in the crackdown on Wall Street. Prosecutors have little clue
Chris_arnade	723716335348375553	2016-04-23T03:33:15	4. That sort of police work requires time and money. And politicians and a public willing to spend the resources, and be patient
Chris_arnade	723715717871353856	2016-04-23T03:30:47	3. It lazy &amp; pointless. The real shit, the miserable, disgusting, and common abuse of girls. The trucks bringing in lbs of heroin. Ignored
Chris_arnade	723714622658883584	2016-04-23T03:26:26	2. In Bronx to combat the disarray, they drive a van through certain streets on certain nights &amp; collect kids slinging drugs. Or prostitutes
Chris_arnade	723713986324209664	2016-04-23T03:23:54	1. When the police police, and the prosecutors prosecute, it is  amazing how dumb/lazy they are about it. Regardless of who is the target
Chris_arnade	723650266197843968	2016-04-22T23:10:42	A J-school student studied hard the bullet points about how to humanize a story. But plants

Chris_arnade	723329283758927872	2016-04-22T01:55:14	johnedwinmason Right. As I have said many times, the greatest measure of someones elitism is their education: amount and from where.
Chris_arnade	723328543954997248	2016-04-22T01:52:18	johnedwinmason The biggest shock many Southern Liberals have when they move north is the arrogance of many liberals.
Chris_arnade	723328142849519620	2016-04-22T01:50:42	johnedwinmason Yep. Agree with much of it. Mirrors a lot of what I have been trying to get across. It is something I hate about the NE

Chris_arnade	723254483547987969	2016-04-21T20:58:00	The gunslinger comp structure we now have, encourages, and rewards, absurd, and stupid, risk taking.  
Chris_arnade	723253954713378816	2016-04-21T20:55:54	Restructuring comp doesn't only make Finance safer, it also addresses fairness. An issue few policy makers seem to focus on, or care about
Chris_arnade	723253540504870914	2016-04-21T20:54:16	The demise of the partnership mentality was the biggest cultural change in banking over the last thirty years, and not a good one.
Chris_arnade	723253264523878400	2016-04-21T20:53:10	If you want to transform Banking, make compensation, and hence incentives, partnership like: Long lock-ups &amp; claw-backs.  carney
Chris_arnade	723251949735411714	2016-04-21T20:47:56	This. But four years is like nothing. Ten to twenty. Still, good start (ps. GS slowly Becoming a partnership again)

Chris_arnade	723207497712951296	2016-04-21T17:51:18	SIRF_Report The_Analyst eisingerj Exactly....
Chris_arnade	723206746571964417	2016-04-21T17:48:19	sirf_report Right, that is what is interesting about this story. As I said, I am agnostic on prosecution the_analyst eisingerj
Chris_arnade	723206169590902784	2016-04-21T17:46:02	the_analyst These cases seem odd ones to prosecute, when so much other shit was going down. But, they felt they could
Chris_arnade	723205433318621184	2016-04-21T17:43:06	the_analyst I am agnostic on this deal. I am generally not favorable to prosecution in these cases. Yet eisingerj is.

Chris_arnade	723193630228398080	2016-04-21T16:56:12	Here is the source for my SEC story today, Jim Kidney, on why he came forward about the lax Goldman investigation: 
Chris_arnade	723193099984490496	2016-04-21T16:54:05	That this is published in home of smugness, smart-assed-ness, hyper rational soul-less-ness.   Gives me hope  
Chris_arnade	723185715857608706	2016-04-21T16:24:45	Elon Musk had a Brady bond trade idea. He’s lucky his boss rejected it (hey, this is cool!)

Chris_arnade	722883511825203200	2016-04-20T20:23:54	MTsetsekas more than that.  Collateral never close to 50. Bond price never below collateral value. Not close.

Chris_arnade	722882377186418688	2016-04-20T20:19:23	MTsetsekas that is the loans. Without collateral backing.

Chris_arnade	722878015668162561	2016-04-20T20:02:04	Speaking of LTCM, and smart (yet dumb) trading. Here is something I wrote about them/RV trading long ago in Sci Am  
Chris_arnade	722875991375421440	2016-04-20T19:54:01	kalidane That is exactly what that story is meant to portray skelecap
Chris_arnade	722867940811362305	2016-04-20T19:22:01	MTsetsekas A lot of banks got buried in Brazil! hence the Brady plan.....
Chris_arnade	722864273047707648	2016-04-20T19:07:27	dsquareddigest There is also the haircut factor going into the deals that confused a lot of people.
Chris_arnade	722863160861069312	2016-04-20T19:03:02	mtsetsekas That price didn't include the collateral!
Chris_arnade	722861922882859013	2016-04-20T18:58:07	18. So be as dumb as you want to be, but just convince everybody else that you are smart.
Chris_arnade	722861805354229760	2016-04-20T18:57:39	17. What makes you good at trading is convincing others that your way of seeing things is smart.
Chris_arnade	722861309965025281	2016-04-20T18:55:41	16. Anyways. He better off not trading bonds. Not because is isn't smart, but because sometimes being smart makes you suck at trading
Chris_arnade	722859941363638272	2016-04-20T18:50:14	15. Because cheap doesn't mean a thing in a mark to market world. Because cheap can always get cheaper.
Chris_arnade	722859680767328256	2016-04-20T18:49:12	14. Which is why myself, LTCM, and pretty much every prop desk on Wall Street loaded up on them. And then lost a shit load of money on them.
Chris_arnade	722859504078045184	2016-04-20T18:48:30	13. Again. Elon was right. The Brady bonds were stupidly cheap. Not so cheap they were less than value of collateral. But cheap
Chris_arnade	722859157779570688	2016-04-20T18:47:07	12. That not taking into account that Tsy zeros were locked away in a safe. Secondary markets on them put a discount of 2% (illiquidity)
Chris_arnade	722858843529678848	2016-04-20T18:45:53	11. The "rolling interest guarantee" says US will cover 3 coupon payments if defaults. For Brazil Pars that was $9 for a Total = $20.42
Chris_arnade	722858509965123584	2016-04-20T18:44:33	10. For bond traders at home. Here is how to value the collateral.   - It has a 30 year zero. So, back then, 7.5% rate. That worth $11.42
Chris_arnade	722857965359861760	2016-04-20T18:42:23	9. Now he super smart guy, so I imagine there is something missing.  Still, even if a bond super cheap, you can still lose a shit load of $
Chris_arnade	722857458734116864	2016-04-20T18:40:22	8. Elon, if the story is correct, got it wrong. Miscalculated value of the Brady bond. Which is why I imagine the GS salesmen was happy
Chris_arnade	722857030478917632	2016-04-20T18:38:40	7. I lost about 500 MM on them (LTCM numbers give or take a billion)  That how markets work. You can own a cheap asset &amp; It can get cheaper
Chris_arnade	722856603234541569	2016-04-20T18:36:58	6. Thing is a cheap asset doesn't necessarily get you far. Not in a mark to market world.   So, around 97, LTCM lost about 2 billion on them
Chris_arnade	722856330080489472	2016-04-20T18:35:53	5. So widely known that LTCM bought about 20 billion of them, and hedged them against other bonds. I bought about 5 billion of them
Chris_arnade	722856159741374464	2016-04-20T18:35:13	4. Yet the Brady bonds, when collateral value was taken into account, where still cheap, It was widely known on the street.
Chris_arnade	722855919378411520	2016-04-20T18:34:15	3. It was at most 25 (10 dollars for 30 year zero, 15 for 3 coupons).   Prices also never got below the value of the collateral.
Chris_arnade	722855696082067456	2016-04-20T18:33:22	2. Or writer of the story is confused. I traded Brady bonds, starting in 93. I also helped value the "backstop collateral"  it was never 50
Chris_arnade	722855350991527938	2016-04-20T18:32:00	1. This thing was posted online about Elon Musk  It is wrong. Either he forgot, is exaggerating, or was wrong then

Chris_arnade	721723646520270848	2016-04-17T15:35:00	Result of this, in advice to artist/writers/journalist. Get out of NYC. Go to a smaller town (Buffalo, Montgomery AL) and focus on that

Chris_arnade	721117393787949056	2016-04-15T23:25:59	Point of Black swans is to remember that in every system there are unknowable things, and a certain percentage of them can do huge damage
Chris_arnade	721116822293098496	2016-04-15T23:23:42	Additionally the world is path-dependent. Simple probability adjusted arithmetic averages of costs don't take into account death.
Chris_arnade	721116391970050049	2016-04-15T23:22:00	More importantly, the regulators, the models lenders use, etc,  under-estimate things, pushing system into taking dumb risk
Chris_arnade	721115889752477697	2016-04-15T23:20:00	This is made worse because investors are bifurcated. Those who over-estimate risk, don't invest. Those who underestimate invest.
Chris_arnade	721115564320669697	2016-04-15T23:18:42	So you can both overestimate probability that something bad will happen, and underestimate the costs of consequences.
Chris_arnade	721115066381287426	2016-04-15T23:16:44	Outlier events, and dangers from them, are about incalculability and hence underestimating the consequences, not probabilities.

Chris_arnade	721065385265598464	2016-04-15T19:59:19	noahpinion The average person DOES overestimate prob of black swans. But models/regulators/lenders, do the opposite. And they invest
Chris_arnade	721065055756939264	2016-04-15T19:58:00	noahpinion And with bifurcated investing (overestimating prob people won't invest), both Taleb (shudder) and you, can be correct.
Chris_arnade	721064712801239042	2016-04-15T19:56:38	noahpinion Point I am making, people can overestimate the probability of them, yet their impact can still be underestimated
Chris_arnade	721064002873335808	2016-04-15T19:53:49	noahpinion Your piece: Impact/relevance of black-swans is less about probability, more about discontinuity. Models/world can't handle it
Chris_arnade	721063549154541568	2016-04-15T19:52:01	m_c_klein Exactly. Banks are run for the employees, not the investors. Funny how Wall Street wants that model for itself. Not others

Chris_arnade	720954376630702080	2016-04-15T12:38:12	Point being. African American voters can be "insiders" also. And in the south they often are.
Chris_arnade	720954154525585408	2016-04-15T12:37:19	Hillary is especially strong there because the party structure itself is especially strong there. She is the insider.

Chris_arnade	720952860104597504	2016-04-15T12:32:11	I mean, Southern black politicians are very much part of the Democratic Parties statues quo at this point.
Chris_arnade	720951493763940352	2016-04-15T12:26:45	In all this hillary/Bernie southern talk, seems to be mistaken belief that African-Americans cannot be part of political elite.

Chris_arnade	720827883078352897	2016-04-15T04:15:34	jacobkimmel That is about right (I am from Pasco County). Still lots of Southern places in south central.

Chris_arnade	720826633985220608	2016-04-15T04:10:36	davidshor So in weird way, county has become a mix of deep south, and older Appalachians/Rustbelters
Chris_arnade	720826519900151808	2016-04-15T04:10:09	davidshor History is deep south (KKK burned cross on our lawn in 73). Thing about Rust Belt retirees: Many originally came from Appalachia
Chris_arnade	720826067284439040	2016-04-15T04:08:21	davidshor That is my home county! Party defined now by who retires there: It is blue collar whites, mostly from Rust Belt.

Chris_arnade	720823126347685888	2016-04-15T03:56:40	mad_science_guy I claim anything north of I-84
Chris_arnade	720822995128856576	2016-04-15T03:56:08	quantian1 I claim there 7 distinct NY regions, 4 that get all labeled as upstate  Lower hudson valley Adirondacks Catskills Rust Belt
Chris_arnade	720822431754166272	2016-04-15T03:53:54	carsonsieving cszabla Take it up with jbouie   I think all of FL, southern tip (and now Orlando), is Deep South
Chris_arnade	720822344718004225	2016-04-15T03:53:33	cherzeca I said anything north of i-84
Chris_arnade	720821756571881473	2016-04-15T03:51:13	I will fight anyone on pointless US Geographical labeling. What constitutes upstate NY? Deep South FL? Appalachian Pennsylvania? West Texas?
Chris_arnade	720821344728911872	2016-04-15T03:49:35	carsonsieving Hey, you and cszabla are on same wavelength. I said anything north of 84
Chris_arnade	720820934471458816	2016-04-15T03:47:57	cszabla Oh lets go there…. It begins North of 84
Chris_arnade	720820388465352705	2016-04-15T03:45:47	And I think defining what in FL is Deep South, and what isn't, is a great use of my time.
Chris_arnade	720819995572350976	2016-04-15T03:44:13	realtomsawyer Basically the coast (and 15 miles in) all around southern FL is not Deep South. The rest of the state is though jbouie
Chris_arnade	720819529148940288	2016-04-15T03:42:22	Thesis: Clinton does well in black belt, because majority minority districts dominate &amp; they are "safe" seats, &amp; hence more establishment
Chris_arnade	720818291565051904	2016-04-15T03:37:27	To say only Panhandle of FL is Deep South is to not know Fl. And not knowing Fl is a very good thing!
Chris_arnade	720817970327482368	2016-04-15T03:36:10	Most of FL, other than lower 1/6th, is Deep south. Ocala, Bel Glades, Ruskin. Hell what about Lee County? 
Chris_arnade	720816531278589952	2016-04-15T03:30:27	jbouie Come to Lacoochee FL. It is deep south (and not in Panhandle. Bel Glades. Deep South) A very large portion of FL deep south

Chris_arnade	720621032235773952	2016-04-14T14:33:37	That consumer level strength of their business will be what generates profits. And at todays prices, it is priced for very few profits.
Chris_arnade	720620853621350401	2016-04-14T14:32:54	Citi has a great name brand in EM. When crises hit, their bank deposit rates rally, going to well well below government rates
Chris_arnade	720620132523974656	2016-04-14T14:30:02	If anybody gets what ails Citi, it is Mike Corbat. The entire question is if he can tame the huge tangled beast that it is. Seems to be.
Chris_arnade	720619882426011648	2016-04-14T14:29:03	(this part now non analytic) I worked closely with Mike Corbat for 7 yrs (in early 90s). Nobody I have worked with was as talented to be CEO
Chris_arnade	720619265536192513	2016-04-14T14:26:36	The culture of Citi has changed the quickest because it was once the worst student. And was thrown in detention. Had no choice.
Chris_arnade	720619043162570754	2016-04-14T14:25:43	Also, the cultural has changed. The demands of regulations (like the living will, see todays matt_levine piece) have forced them to change
Chris_arnade	720618944453877761	2016-04-14T14:25:19	Put another way, what once hurt Citi, relative to others, is now illegal (stop hurting yourself!), or a positive
Chris_arnade	720618881656692736	2016-04-14T14:25:04	Citi has suffered from being too big, and stupid, and badly managed, to understand how to take lots of market risk. Now they can't. Perfect
Chris_arnade	720618794725609472	2016-04-14T14:24:43	Banking is becoming a more boring business, that emphasizes brand and diminishes value of creativity/risk taking. Perfect for Citi
Chris_arnade	720618713049903104	2016-04-14T14:24:24	2) Their large bureaucracy is suited to new environment that demands bureaucracy  3) They worth more if broken up 4) Management gets this
Chris_arnade	720618557227298816	2016-04-14T14:23:47	I am bullish on Citi because  1) They well served by the diminishing role of trading for banks (the source of most of their past problems)

Chris_arnade	720578256446099456	2016-04-14T11:43:38	lewiskaybush As a PhD I aint against intellectual thought. I find it loses mooring the further it drifts from numbers. Art is far from that

Chris_arnade	719530706003734529	2016-04-11T14:21:03	Anyways. Read Roberto Bolano's The Third Reich. Really though, read anything by him.
Chris_arnade	719530172605669376	2016-04-11T14:18:56	D&amp;D appeal was primarily social. It provided both a form of escape, and a form of social bonding, for shy people.

Chris_arnade	719272801056747520	2016-04-10T21:16:13	Question: since sabermetric take over of baseball, has the standard deviation of managerial decisions increased or decreased.?
Chris_arnade	719263590360944640	2016-04-10T20:39:37	Thesis: The analytic take over of baseball has made it less interesting as fan. Like arbitrage free markets are the most boring to trade
Chris_arnade	719261831383134210	2016-04-10T20:32:38	Because honestly, the true value in being a fan comes from feeling superior to the coach/management/ownership

Chris_arnade	718816691610894336	2016-04-09T15:03:48	modeledbehavior That I completely agree with. More important than size, to me, is compensation incentives. Need partnerships (or behavior)

Chris_arnade	718808325882802177	2016-04-09T14:30:34	cptnjustc I would not risk-adjust, I would cap size at 600 BN. Also, leverage limits at between 10-13
Chris_arnade	718808004297170944	2016-04-09T14:29:17	Bernie is Liberals Reagan: Good instincts, optimistic (from their perspective), but soft on details (and old) 
Chris_arnade	718804843264155648	2016-04-09T14:16:44	8) It would also probably by profitable. Ten Citibanks would, IMO (and many in market) have a value greater than todays huge Citibank.
Chris_arnade	718804595850547200	2016-04-09T14:15:45	7) PS: There is really no need for details when breaking up TBTF banks. It is easy. Put cap on size, give them a few years to adjust
Chris_arnade	718804200092778496	2016-04-09T14:14:10	6) Net net. Both Krugman, and his leftist critics missed the point. Bernie got it right (primarily because he didn't go into details!)
Chris_arnade	718803822890655745	2016-04-09T14:12:40	5) Still, turning Citibank into ten smaller Citibanks won't stop  them from all buying the same thing. All banks buy the same things
Chris_arnade	718803647946223620	2016-04-09T14:11:59	4) It will also go a long way to destroying the unnecessarily large influence the banks have on policy/markets. It is also easy to do.
Chris_arnade	718803454030974976	2016-04-09T14:11:12	3) Breaking up the TBTF banks, consequently, will make another crisis easier to deal with when it hits. It won't stop one
Chris_arnade	718803281624055808	2016-04-09T14:10:31	2) Yet the crisis was made all the worse by the TBTF banks, like Citi et all that looked like Lehman, only times 10.
Chris_arnade	718802986693193728	2016-04-09T14:09:21	On Krugman, Sanders, Banking 1) Lehman was a relatively small bank, and Lehman didn't cause crisis. Rather it showed policy was inept
Chris_arnade	718801989707108352	2016-04-09T14:05:23	No. These days Liberals love central banks. It is the conservatives who want to do away with them.

Chris_arnade	718529143109984256	2016-04-08T20:01:12	tengdin My point is that Tribe (economist) have far too much policy power
Chris_arnade	718527685996240896	2016-04-08T19:55:24	True. Everybody, literally everybody, knows there are "no credible economist"

Chris_arnade	718510231999918081	2016-04-08T18:46:03	Financial twitter is the most open minded (and best to argue with) twitter. Which was also true of banking itself.

Chris_arnade	718496850488270849	2016-04-08T17:52:52	"Put a cross on it!" is the southern "put a bird on it!" 
Chris_arnade	718488681443680256	2016-04-08T17:20:25	ryanchittum so entirely disingenuous of Krugman to say Lehman was just a small bank, and proves TBTF was not a problem.
Chris_arnade	718488439046451200	2016-04-08T17:19:27	ryanchittum In that sense, Lehman was canary in coal mine. Citi was the huge monster the loomed over all (PS: I worked at Citi then!)
Chris_arnade	718488225250205696	2016-04-08T17:18:36	ryanchittum It also showed that the entire banking sector, TBTF and smaller institutions, had too much leverage and opaque accounting
Chris_arnade	718488030588362752	2016-04-08T17:17:50	ryanchittum Lehman important because it revealed officials to be confused. The crisis was about Citi and other TBTF banks
Chris_arnade	718484981056737280	2016-04-08T17:05:42	zatapatique Rather than remove them (to be single trick pony), standardize everything, put on exchange. Bespoke stuff, clear via exchange
Chris_arnade	718484472006578176	2016-04-08T17:03:41	ryanchittum  Citi did fail&gt; Not official, but it did. Was bankrupt. It, more than lehman, was the problem
Chris_arnade	718483769582346240	2016-04-08T17:00:54	zatapatique I would probably remove single name CDS. (That is me though). You can always just short the bond. Or not own it.
Chris_arnade	718483340286902272	2016-04-08T16:59:11	zatapatique (and I do accept being guilty of hyperbole in some prior tweets!)
Chris_arnade	718483215477026817	2016-04-08T16:58:41	zatapatique Their P&amp;L was 10X the flow swap desk. Yes bulk of derivatives via notional is "good things" but not via profit or emphasis
Chris_arnade	718482923993853952	2016-04-08T16:57:32	zatapatique I sat next to group that did massive and complex Trades with Enron. All packed out of "standard" products. They made mint
Chris_arnade	718482738760806400	2016-04-08T16:56:48	zatapatique I don't got problem with exchange traded credit indexes. Single named bespoke CDS. Hmmmmm
Chris_arnade	718482610687709184	2016-04-08T16:56:17	zatapatique And, yes, I am old enough to remember (as you probably are) life pre CDS. Markets where not frozen. Functioned
Chris_arnade	718482458363183109	2016-04-08T16:55:41	zatapatique  banks have little interest in doing that, because the 20% is very very profitable. And they don't want transparency on 80%
Chris_arnade	718482237860286465	2016-04-08T16:54:48	zatapatique What you have is a system built for 80% of the legal biz, that also caters to 20% shady things. Not hard to remove the 20%
Chris_arnade	718482033115328512	2016-04-08T16:54:00	zatapatique Standardize products, but them on exchange. Non standard products cleared via exchange, and put in new products committee
Chris_arnade	718479616361500672	2016-04-08T16:44:23	zatapatique I worked twenty years in derivatives, and perhaps nature of my biz, but 70% was about arbing regulations/taxes
Chris_arnade	718479224038887424	2016-04-08T16:42:50	zatapatique It is very bi-modal. Lots of good from it, but also lots of very shady things.
Chris_arnade	718476769611931648	2016-04-08T16:33:05	tengdin true leverage limits (not risk adjusted), and luxury tax on balance sheets above X
Chris_arnade	718476553286508545	2016-04-08T16:32:13	tengdin That is my view as well, and my hope for simplest way to deal with it all.
Chris_arnade	718476218878849024	2016-04-08T16:30:53	zatapatique Or, put another way, given that snowball swap is just a bunch of calls/puts, denial gets pretty deep quickly if we don't!
Chris_arnade	718475896819159043	2016-04-08T16:29:37	zatapatique I am for both. Put everything, or clear it, via an exchange. Non standard products have to clear new products committee
Chris_arnade	718475609727451137	2016-04-08T16:28:28	zatapatique I mean, snow-ball swaps is also just a collection of common products….  Two choices. Over capitalize banks, or limit products
Chris_arnade	718473849487167490	2016-04-08T16:21:28	tengdin Oh shit man, you went all Kant on me. On Twitter. I will need like 200 characters to deal with this
Chris_arnade	718473409093623813	2016-04-08T16:19:43	zatapatique So, yes, it is a capitalization problem, but really it is a non-linear asset problem IMO
Chris_arnade	718473296921128961	2016-04-08T16:19:17	zatapatique Oh, yes, that. All Non-linear assets (CDS is one, most every derivative is), make that problem huge.
Chris_arnade	718472912819367936	2016-04-08T16:17:45	tengdin 
Chris_arnade	718472700977680384	2016-04-08T16:16:55	zatapatique Both true!
Chris_arnade	718472448874844160	2016-04-08T16:15:55	zatapatique I am old school. Every ammortizer can be built from bullets!
Chris_arnade	718472210818666500	2016-04-08T16:14:58	zatapatique (I don't understand this tweet, and it my fault. I should. Explain more please) georgepearkes
Chris_arnade	718471828407259137	2016-04-08T16:13:27	zatapatique The problem comes in the absurd legal language surrounding the contract. georgepearkes
Chris_arnade	718471747100680193	2016-04-08T16:13:07	tengdin Selling out of the money puts only works 9 out of 10 years. Then. BOOOOM. (Ask LTCM)
Chris_arnade	718471448130633728	2016-04-08T16:11:56	zatapatique I swing both ways on this one. At is core, CDS is about locking in shorting cost to maturity. That isn't bad georgepearkes
Chris_arnade	718470953706119168	2016-04-08T16:09:58	On Lehman: Somehow both Krugman, and his leftist critics, manage to get it wrong.
Chris_arnade	718469618214551552	2016-04-08T16:04:40	This is true: The markets are better regulated now than when I quit.  
Chris_arnade	718469077996580865	2016-04-08T16:02:31	georgepearkes I overlapped with old banking/finance model: No CDS, etc. Wasn't really that bad….
Chris_arnade	718468412066959360	2016-04-08T15:59:52	georgepearkes but I would push back. If folks only could do standard IRS swaps (bullet maturity, SA payments, etc). How bad would it be?
Chris_arnade	718467730224115713	2016-04-08T15:57:10	georgepearkes I would clear all standard OTC via exchange. With netting etc. I am uncertain about single name CDS. Depends on day.
Chris_arnade	718467578620944384	2016-04-08T15:56:33	georgepearkes To be more clear, I would ban most non-standard OTC trades. I think we both know what those are. Nothing funky.
Chris_arnade	718467094703173632	2016-04-08T15:54:38	georgepearkes I agree I tend to fail in both of those directions! 147 characters is my excuse
Chris_arnade	718466298733309952	2016-04-08T15:51:28	georgepearkes you can have OTC that is cleared via an exchange. Look at how BM&amp;F does it. Basically be-spoke trades go into another account
Chris_arnade	718465921682116609	2016-04-08T15:49:58	georgepearkes IRS should be cleared via an exchange! (or put another way, IRS shouldn't be OTC)
Chris_arnade	718465563937415172	2016-04-08T15:48:33	georgepearkes I think it is…. OTC certainly.
Chris_arnade	718465159199633408	2016-04-08T15:46:57	georgepearkes why I said most :) and OTC
Chris_arnade	718462263284363264	2016-04-08T15:35:26	matt_levine No. They not that good. They just wanted to ride Korea…. Worked until like 97….
Chris_arnade	718459737776513025	2016-04-08T15:25:24	18/ The trader was leaning on an actual golf club, took the club, and put it through the screen. "There, that is what I am going to do."
Chris_arnade	718459264222785536	2016-04-08T15:23:31	18/ When screen started flashing prices against him the head risk guy was standing next to him, and asked what he was going to do about loss
Chris_arnade	718458717805670401	2016-04-08T15:21:21	17/ End rant with humor. The Tokyo arbitrage guy who pushed the Golf Club idea for us, hated being wrong. One day, he was limit short JGBs
Chris_arnade	718458001137528832	2016-04-08T15:18:30	16/ Epsilon good from having financial derivatives (perhaps a .5% increase in global growth?) is way offset by gamma instability they add
Chris_arnade	718457021872349184	2016-04-08T15:14:36	15/ And before the libertarians have a go at me: Snowball swaps.   (PS: Matt_levine would probably disagree)  
Chris_arnade	718456612596400129	2016-04-08T15:12:59	14/ And if I had my way, almost all new financial products would be illegal. Certainly almost all OTC derivatives.
Chris_arnade	718456057912246272	2016-04-08T15:10:47	13/ So yes the Panama thing, and no it isn't at all a surprise. Rather the surprise is that anyone is surprised

Chris_arnade	718455013572534276	2016-04-08T15:06:38	11/ Arbitraging regulation is the bread and butter of OTC derivatives -- It is their primary value to finance.
Chris_arnade	718454534402650112	2016-04-08T15:04:43	10/ We didn't go down the Golf Club direction -- there were easier, and equally opaque/absurd, ways to invest without paying the fee.
Chris_arnade	718454204461948928	2016-04-08T15:03:25	9/ And tried to get our Latin America group (where I worked) to try the same thing to get around Brazilian IOF tax (a 7% fee on inflows)
Chris_arnade	718453957501329408	2016-04-08T15:02:26	8/ Salomon Brothers arbitrage group, in Tokyo, took it seriously enough that they wrote up a trade proposal for doing the same thing.

Chris_arnade	718452722589114369	2016-04-08T14:57:31	6/ It was talked about often on the street, amongst EM traders, and was considered to be the holy grail of cross border arbitrage
Chris_arnade	718452547523100672	2016-04-08T14:56:50	6/ All of this was done through about 5 shell companies. One in Japan, others scattered around, to both conceal true owners, and for taxes
Chris_arnade	718452324528693248	2016-04-08T14:55:57	5/ That golf club then invested in Korean stocks and bonds, with the members, now an outside hedge fund, receiving annual profits/losses
Chris_arnade	718452056365920257	2016-04-08T14:54:53	4/ A certain hedge fund used this method to buy, and take over controlling interest, in a Korean golf club. They then capitalized it
Chris_arnade	718451833497350146	2016-04-08T14:53:59	3/ Most investments by outsiders into Korea were not allowed. Except one: Buying memberships in private, and exclusive, golf clubs
Chris_arnade	718451431787872257	2016-04-08T14:52:24	2/ Back in the early 90s, foreigners couldn't invest in Korean bond/equity markets, unless a huge upfront tax was paid.

Chris_arnade	718416939471806466	2016-04-08T12:35:20	Lehman this, Lehman that. It was Citi that was the big MoFo in the room. It was Citi whose failure (and they failed) freaked everyone out
Chris_arnade	718416264998293504	2016-04-08T12:32:39	Lehman signaled that Citi and JP and BAC were at risk. And they were big. That was the problem, not Lehman.
Chris_arnade	718415527362883584	2016-04-08T12:29:43	But Lehman was small, relative, by assets &amp; leverage.  Their failure was important/deadly  because it signaled policy confusion/incompetence

Chris_arnade	713141474997714944	2016-03-24T23:12:31	Thesis: New Yorker's readers are so niche, and so self selected, as to render it unimportant and without influence.
Chris_arnade	713090566653886464	2016-03-24T19:50:14	EricJWeiner1 I grew up in rural Florida! School education was awful. Jobs I worked taught me tons though
Chris_arnade	713089117991657472	2016-03-24T19:44:28	ericjweiner1 In that regards, I do believe Democrats haven't done their best. The mocking thing. Pretty bad in certain circles
Chris_arnade	713088554730188801	2016-03-24T19:42:14	ericjweiner1 Oh yes indeed. I kind of thought that was implicit in piece, but should of been explicit
Chris_arnade	713087592770613249	2016-03-24T19:38:25	ericjweiner1 In what sense? (not that I don't necessarily agree:) )
Chris_arnade	713087138531770369	2016-03-24T19:36:37	grkstav Yet I believe our hyper rational society, or economic and social predatory rationalism, needs a reboot
Chris_arnade	713086960794001408	2016-03-24T19:35:54	grkstav Completely agree. Hopefully there is a way to ensure basic equality for all, without making any one group feel "devalued"
Chris_arnade	713085492141694976	2016-03-24T19:30:04	grkstav It was edited for making piece concise. I have another piece that is about that, and religion, and arrogance of academics :)
Chris_arnade	713081822087880706	2016-03-24T19:15:29	grkstav it does, and I had a paragraph about that, but was left out

Chris_arnade	713077950933938176	2016-03-24T19:00:06	mdpollak ddayen Very true. So much wrong with NR piece. This is what I ended my piece with (although was cut). 
Chris_arnade	713076856086351872	2016-03-24T18:55:45	mdpollak Yes. Although I am a Harry Potter guy. The type who after release of last book was in bar at 4AM still reading it

Chris_arnade	713070976284626944	2016-03-24T18:32:23	I approve of this list (Especially Winners bar!), but I could add another thirty to it

Chris_arnade	713067622254796801	2016-03-24T18:19:03	J. M. Coetzee coined it, "Predatory economic rationalism"  Think it fits our world very well.
Chris_arnade	713067094972076032	2016-03-24T18:16:58	The Republicans because they love Business, and the Democrats because they love Rationalism.
Chris_arnade	713065497302925312	2016-03-24T18:10:37	In that regard, both political parties, are guilty of moving our society to one based almost entirely on transient materialism.
Chris_arnade	713065275772379136	2016-03-24T18:09:44	grkstav I had all sorts of links to sociological studies! (basically, polls, and attendance records)
Chris_arnade	713064814092746756	2016-03-24T18:07:54	What I regret leaving out (for brevity) from my piece on white-working class is the impact of the devaluation of Religion in our society.

Chris_arnade	713057928425684994	2016-03-24T17:40:32	m_c_klein ladyfohf I got the intended part (and I agree with that). Yet, I admit to having not worked my way through entire piece. Long
Chris_arnade	713057429525651456	2016-03-24T17:38:33	m_c_klein ladyfohf I will give it another go; when site is not infected.  I also love brevity. He doesn't!

Chris_arnade	713019690042437632	2016-03-24T15:08:36	EpicureanDeal I would agree mostly with that. Certainly shoulder the burden of the mocking part
Chris_arnade	713018535023394816	2016-03-24T15:04:00	elizabethcatte they edited my piece a lot. I said move where? Appalachia has become trend setter. They turning all US into a big Appalachia

Chris_arnade	712991166946537472	2016-03-24T13:15:15	jwmason1 Yep. I spent 20 years betting on EM defaults/devaluations on Wall Street. IMF has resisted, wrongly, capital controls.
Chris_arnade	712990645455982598	2016-03-24T13:13:11	jwmason1 Or, change the world to only semi-freely mobile capital.

Chris_arnade	712688548814696449	2016-03-23T17:12:45	bendwalsh jwmason1 Slightly worse than that. Take private company. Assign value to two class of shares A and B. Dramatically undervalue A

Chris_arnade	709890364749049860	2016-03-15T23:53:46	Florida retirees are one the most racist groups I have ever lived with.  Just to be clear, no equivocation.

Chris_arnade	709887212863758336	2016-03-15T23:41:15	Retirees fleeing decaying cities, coupled with local history of hate, combined into a new hyper form of racism  The county seethed in hate
Chris_arnade	709886001460678658	2016-03-15T23:36:26	Those retirees taught me that racism just wasn't a southern thing. In fact, they embraced the racism they found, and magnified it.
Chris_arnade	709885539416199168	2016-03-15T23:34:36	Where people retire in FL is very much determined by class. My county attracted working class whites from Appalachia and Michigan mostly

Chris_arnade	709883818178650112	2016-03-15T23:27:45	The little league wasn't in my town, because of its demand for integration. So us white kids played in the Dixie League

Chris_arnade	709835914906836993	2016-03-15T20:17:24	Today there are a lot of Liberal pundits acting like they never stereotype the white working class as uncultured idiots

Chris_arnade	709823727500988416	2016-03-15T19:28:59	yappelbaum most vicious thing about that essay, is how it views poverty/addiction as atavistic failings, rather than political
Chris_arnade	709821383019200516	2016-03-15T19:19:40	.Yappelbaum piece on kevinNR is rather kind to him. I doubt he will see it that way though

Chris_arnade	709816874419265538	2016-03-15T19:01:45	reihan To deny the economic changes, or the social changes, that have reshaped much of America is simple minded moralism.
Chris_arnade	709816526736637952	2016-03-15T19:00:22	reihan It is a common trope with addiction: The addict is weak, is lazy, tired, captured by the allure of drugs. An individual failing
Chris_arnade	709816210674810880	2016-03-15T18:59:07	reihan The implication is they are weak, not because of any outside or political force, but because of failings of their own making.
Chris_arnade	709815691973664770	2016-03-15T18:57:03	reihan yes, and he also said they are captured, almost atavistically, by a vicious and selfish culture. Details

Chris_arnade	709809413335420929	2016-03-15T18:32:06	mattyglesias yes, he uses straw region argument: White working class is also a suburban/urban thing: South Buffalo, Cleveland, Boston etc
Chris_arnade	709808963534114816	2016-03-15T18:30:19	Notion that National Review represents a powerful voice in the conservative movement is not at all ridiculous

Chris_arnade	709773417143255040	2016-03-15T16:09:04	johnedwinmason I did see that, but missing from so many other arguments. Seems like a slam dunk way to diminish him.

Chris_arnade	709756227945893888	2016-03-15T15:00:46	Responding to the piece is wrong, given how offensive it was. But it is a reminder of the core views of todays Republicans about the poor

Chris_arnade	709755033261363200	2016-03-15T14:56:01	White working class is equally a suburban thing, and an urban thing. It is Yonkers, and it is South Buffalo, and Cleveland.
Chris_arnade	709754847130738688	2016-03-15T14:55:16	Small aside: Much of his arguments are based on rural Kentucky, which isn't fully representative of white working class (or Trump voters)
Chris_arnade	709753972513488899	2016-03-15T14:51:48	Nice reminder: conservatives see poverty as atavistic, not political.   The poor are proto-human, and they, the rich, are fully human.
Chris_arnade	709753411282067456	2016-03-15T14:49:34	To that end kevinNR &amp; davidAfrench have done great service to the white working class; revealing they don't want anything to do with them
Chris_arnade	709752621653950466	2016-03-15T14:46:26	Sure conservatives, like KevinNR, will use the white working class to fight their wars, but they won't ever socialize with them. Too louche
Chris_arnade	709752289603547137	2016-03-15T14:45:07	White working class have not just been left behind by Liberal elites in NYC &amp; DC, but by conservatives who once claimed to care about them.
Chris_arnade	709752013089841153	2016-03-15T14:44:01	They haven't just been devalued economically but socially as well. A great example of how it is now ok to laugh at them? His very article!
Chris_arnade	709751635279536128	2016-03-15T14:42:31	Yet he is half correct: white working class failure/anger, is not just a result of economic problems. It is also a result of social problems
Chris_arnade	709751466471374848	2016-03-15T14:41:50	The devaluation of labor, over capital, supported by NR, has rendered many places, rural &amp; urban, devoid of opportunity, and devoid of hope.
Chris_arnade	709751238204792833	2016-03-15T14:40:56	This is wrong; the white working class, and the black working class, HAVE suffered an enormous political problem. Mostly it is economic.
Chris_arnade	709750371078561792	2016-03-15T14:37:29	Going hand in hand with this thesis, is that addiction is a human failing, not a political failing. Heroin addicts are weak, dumb, whatever
Chris_arnade	709750081688367104	2016-03-15T14:36:20	Core argument, behind the over clever writing (Mencken still looms over NR), is poverty is a human failing, not a political failing

Chris_arnade	709497323710259204	2016-03-14T21:51:58	It is something I cannot understand about media and art world. Why make fun of someone who is generally aligned with you with similar goals?
Chris_arnade	709496934504001540	2016-03-14T21:50:25	They didn't. The writer g_bluestone wrote a snarky post; implying HONY wasn't a journalist, and faux brave  
Chris_arnade	709496575404466177	2016-03-14T21:49:00	So HONY, published a thoughtful call to stop Donald Trump. You would think the folks at Gawker would appreciate this.

Chris_arnade	709384244196409344	2016-03-14T14:22:38	But Trump voters are out of the money, and they view their pay-off function to be flat, with any jumps up too high to overcome.
Chris_arnade	709383928231170049	2016-03-14T14:21:22	The "Elites" are in the money, and don't necessarily want volatility. They also don't understand why anyone else would.
Chris_arnade	709383345046683648	2016-03-14T14:19:03	"Elites", are confused, because they see a far different payoff, and hence have a different risk profile

Chris_arnade	709382342100578306	2016-03-14T14:15:04	Yet the actual pay-off is different, and looks more like a series of step functions, with jumps up about education 
Chris_arnade	709381937538924545	2016-03-14T14:13:28	Prevailing assumption about pay-offs in our society, and what elites claim, is work harder/study more, get more 
Chris_arnade	709381485208444928	2016-03-14T14:11:40	The risk-profile of an investors, or anybody, is a function of perceived and actual pay-offs. That is true of voters as well.

Chris_arnade	707392430778290176	2016-03-09T02:27:52	interfluidity Again, to sound like broken record, I think plenty of Liberals understand the economic anger behind Trump jeffspross
Chris_arnade	707373658000457728	2016-03-09T01:13:17	Trump &amp; Hillary both do well in states with lots of African-Americans. For very different reasons  Mississippi has lots of African-Americans
Chris_arnade	707371669380325376	2016-03-09T01:05:22	casmudde Seriously though, I would  love to. Haven't been to Athens since 84…. I am sure it has changed
Chris_arnade	707370718888075264	2016-03-09T01:01:36	casmudde Is REM still infect the music scene there?
Chris_arnade	707369122473111553	2016-03-09T00:55:15	I will be in eastern Tennessee (Johnson City) last week of March, and Georgia first part of April (Dalton, Dahlonega)… If any of you around
Chris_arnade	707317202517663745	2016-03-08T21:28:57	guardianjessica I am sorry that my pieces don't do that; but you have given me ideas for future pieces
Chris_arnade	707290717673136129	2016-03-08T19:43:42	When a problem mostly impacts a minority, the majority views it as an atavistic issue, rather than political
Chris_arnade	707290007560654848	2016-03-08T19:40:53	This also why as heroin has started to really impact whites, drug policy has shifted toward compassion, not jail 
Chris_arnade	707286021470294017	2016-03-08T19:25:02	This, on Trump and race, helps explain the deep south, beyond Trump  
Chris_arnade	707284679410454530	2016-03-08T19:19:42	interfluidity And bigotry is an relevant issue   
Chris_arnade	707280886493024256	2016-03-08T19:04:38	interfluidity Given that I am me, &amp; like my way of thinking, I will again promote my Sep piece on free trade/Trump  
Chris_arnade	707280571538477058	2016-03-08T19:03:23	interfluidity His bigotry is a signal that buys him credibility with a certain type of voter -- often those who are most hurt by free trade
Chris_arnade	707279895546699776	2016-03-08T19:00:42	interfluidity A stretch to say few see his language on Free Trade as central to appeal. Many have been pounding on that point for long
Chris_arnade	707273465615745028	2016-03-08T18:35:09	julia_azari And here is some data to put to that glib observation  
Chris_arnade	707272831931977733	2016-03-08T18:32:38	julia_azari That is fair. I grew up in deep south, live now in NE. I think all things equal, south is just more racist. Slavery thing
Chris_arnade	707272320587599872	2016-03-08T18:30:36	julia_azari To that question, highest % trump votes comes in counties on NH/MA border --- so more complex than my smart ass tweet
Chris_arnade	707271830776713217	2016-03-08T18:28:39	julia_azari ha! No disrespect intended, just that anyone who plays with the Southern Strategy usually ends up eventually burned
