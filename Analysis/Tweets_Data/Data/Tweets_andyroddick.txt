andyroddick	690643250156204032	2016-01-22T21:12:37	Roger and Rafa Twitter fans shock me ....  It's as if you're not allowed to say something nice/respectful about the other guy
andyroddick	690638986453262336	2016-01-22T20:55:40	That was a risk I was willing to take  
andyroddick	690608581234679808	2016-01-22T18:54:51	Speculation never stops. There's no reason for Rafa to have done it. Has the money. Respects the game and his legacy 
andyroddick	690299123501666304	2016-01-21T22:25:10	As opposed to giving up on your spelling .....   That you're allowed to do badly as long as you want

andyroddick	690009739074355200	2016-01-21T03:15:16	It was true 10 years ago ....... It's true today.  I've repeated a lot of words in the last decade   
andyroddick	689996283453554689	2016-01-21T02:21:48	. JohnIsner does ..... You can't teach 6ft 10 .....  
andyroddick	689881365299404803	2016-01-20T18:45:09	It‚Äôs true. 
andyroddick	689642619186450432	2016-01-20T02:56:28	Agreed  
andyroddick	689639843022798849	2016-01-20T02:45:26	Hadn't heard about it  
andyroddick	689634824789733376	2016-01-20T02:25:29	Yes that's crazy. I love Rafa but I don't think that had anything to do w it  
andyroddick	689634508874784768	2016-01-20T02:24:14	Wait ... What?!?!?    What happened?  
andyroddick	689620171711873024	2016-01-20T01:27:16	It pays ..... It definitely pays  
andyroddick	689593757436551168	2016-01-19T23:42:18	JustinVerlander   That's pretty good
andyroddick	689590978399723520	2016-01-19T23:31:15	Beauty of Twitter is that you are completely in control of what you say ........    Same rules for me  
andyroddick	689560940241485824	2016-01-19T21:31:54	Thanks for the follow! Match fixing is the dominant tennis story right now so I'll be talking about it.....   
andyroddick	689552504393072640	2016-01-19T20:58:22	andyroddick Spectoresque agreed. Betting sites want things done right as well.  They don't benefit from match fixing
andyroddick	689549497022611456	2016-01-19T20:46:25	UltimateTennis_   Yes it is
andyroddick	689546927050915840	2016-01-19T20:36:13	I do think it's hypocritical to say players can't accept sponsor money from companies that they allow tournies to  
andyroddick	689546713162321921	2016-01-19T20:35:22	Doesn't change the fact that ultimately it's up to the players to play it the right way...  
andyroddick	689543197513543680	2016-01-19T20:21:24	I'll get through my day ok even w you thinking I'm unreliable ..... I want concrete answers as much as the next guy  
andyroddick	689537070096748544	2016-01-19T19:57:03	So publicly gossiping on educated speculation is the only thing that would keep me from being as bad as fixers?Logic

andyroddick	689313974978924544	2016-01-19T05:10:33	No...  You are incorrect  
andyroddick	689297353929396224	2016-01-19T04:04:30	I would have done it for 10  
andyroddick	689287543620145156	2016-01-19T03:25:31	Hahahaha unfortunately the answer is yes ......  
andyroddick	689287386744815616	2016-01-19T03:24:53	I guess you would know better than I would? And I wouldn't want to have a reason to criticize?  Be real .....  
andyroddick	689282855248134148	2016-01-19T03:06:53	Close call for sure ....  Getting into slams helps a ton now with the increased dollars  
andyroddick	689282477618139136	2016-01-19T03:05:23	And without a moral compass  
andyroddick	689282157181718529	2016-01-19T03:04:07	Not the craziest question I've ever heard

andyroddick	689280614009155585	2016-01-19T02:57:59	Cause I guess it gets answered at some point ......    Zero chance. Was never even approached  
andyroddick	689279761353326592	2016-01-19T02:54:35	In the age of leaks and social media, I don't think secrets exist ....  
andyroddick	689279238541684737	2016-01-19T02:52:31	I highly doubt it is  
andyroddick	689278401543196672	2016-01-19T02:49:11	You got it ....  Only on your suggestion though  
andyroddick	689278169925287936	2016-01-19T02:48:16	Fair assumption hahaha ..... Not him this time though  
andyroddick	689277140085260288	2016-01-19T02:44:11	Not on educated speculation I'm not ... That's unfair
