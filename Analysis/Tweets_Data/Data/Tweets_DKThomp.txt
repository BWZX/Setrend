DKThomp	719904467408265216	2016-04-12T15:06:14	10/ That's the summary! And I'm sure I'm missing a lot. Here's the article.  
DKThomp	719904303209693184	2016-04-12T15:05:35	9/ So, another theory: Building more low-inc housing near healthy cities might improve children's chance of adopting healthiest habits
DKThomp	719904135802458113	2016-04-12T15:04:55	8/ By concentrating poverty, we've also increased the chance that poor kids grow up where bad health behaviors are norms
DKThomp	719903851076272129	2016-04-12T15:03:47	7/ It's in the data: By age of 6, children in less healthy areas drink more sweetened beverages, eat more fatty foods, get less exercise...
DKThomp	719903725956018176	2016-04-12T15:03:18	6/ Meanwhile, distant poorer areas miss out on cultural waves of healthy behavior while entrenching norms--like smoking--in younger gens
DKThomp	719903637108035585	2016-04-12T15:02:56	5/ So, a theory: US income sorting has behavioral externality, concentrating health-seeking demos in rich areas that reinforce good habits
DKThomp	719903438872657920	2016-04-12T15:02:09	4/ For example, Christakis has shown contagiousness for obesity and smoking: 
DKThomp	719903309235097603	2016-04-12T15:01:38	3/ Public health/network research has shown that each of these health behaviors are highly "contagious," or susceptible to social influence
DKThomp	719903214477406209	2016-04-12T15:01:16	2/ Life expectancy for the poor is most correlated, not with external factors (murder), but with behaviors: smoking, obesity, and exercise
DKThomp	719903172739866624	2016-04-12T15:01:06	1/ My piece today connects two things that have fascinated me recently: the "contagiousness" of certain behaviors and US demographics
