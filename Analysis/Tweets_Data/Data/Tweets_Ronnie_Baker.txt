Ronnie_Baker	715623147173588992	2016-03-31T19:33:48	Thinking_Major Well, we could speculate either way for hours and be no closer the truth :-)
Ronnie_Baker	715622669744353280	2016-03-31T19:31:54	Thinking_Major They have trained and supplied 'moderate' rebels whilst giving them political legitimacy.  
Ronnie_Baker	715621269761187840	2016-03-31T19:26:20	Thinking_Major Which is why I think RU achieved better results. Not because RU efficient, but due to deliberate inefficiency on our part
Ronnie_Baker	715620731220922368	2016-03-31T19:24:12	Thinking_Major There was very little focus on defeating ISIL in Syria, because it weakened Assad; gave proxy armies/rebels advantage
Ronnie_Baker	715619957078302720	2016-03-31T19:21:08	Thinking_Major Playing kingmaker in Syria has been the end game since before ISIL spread there.....
Ronnie_Baker	715619559974109185	2016-03-31T19:19:33	Thinking_Major Allegedly. I'd like to have seen more pressure on Saudi, Qatari &amp; Turkish govts.
Ronnie_Baker	715608818047012864	2016-03-31T18:36:52	Thinking_Major Has been demonstrated by RU efforts to close  border with Turkey. This + going after funding of ISIS should've been priority
Ronnie_Baker	715607261318524928	2016-03-31T18:30:41	Thinking_Major My contention is that more could've been done to slow their advance into Syria, with consequent humanitarian suffering.
Ronnie_Baker	715607063078920193	2016-03-31T18:29:53	Thinking_Major Certainly coalition had a freer hand in Iraq. But serves a geopolitical purpose to push ISIS north into Syria also.
Ronnie_Baker	715606849181974528	2016-03-31T18:29:02	Thinking_Major Efforts certainly, achievements, perhaps in time. But inefficient still. Many missed opportunities that would've expedited
Ronnie_Baker	715551728729362432	2016-03-31T14:50:01	JournalNEO Indeed. Has become more obvious as RU strategy delivered better results in significantly less time, at significantly lower cost.

Ronnie_Baker	712688651725975552	2016-03-23T17:13:10	mks_mvp Why?

Ronnie_Baker	712687473734721536	2016-03-23T17:08:29	mks_mvp hahaha no it doesn't. Come on chief, I'm sure you have better things to. I know i do.

Ronnie_Baker	712685297528537088	2016-03-23T16:59:50	mks_mvp lol. Yes i do, I read it. It also talks about other aspects of her FP (Iran, Iraq, Libya etc).
Ronnie_Baker	712684767649529856	2016-03-23T16:57:44	mks_mvp Why would I be speaking at AIPAC?
Ronnie_Baker	712684455505190912	2016-03-23T16:56:29	mks_mvp 'War is war'. Not sure what that means or how it relates to our conversation.
Ronnie_Baker	712684185408778240	2016-03-23T16:55:25	mks_mvp The peace talks were for show. The US is the main obstacle because it gives Israel political legitimacy.
Ronnie_Baker	712683937701564417	2016-03-23T16:54:26	mks_mvp They operate under the umbrella of self defense - backed up politically and financially by the US.
Ronnie_Baker	712683740430864384	2016-03-23T16:53:39	mks_mvp There wouldn't be an all out war, because it would essentially be genocide. Politically impossible for Israel.
Ronnie_Baker	712683251819675648	2016-03-23T16:51:42	mks_mvp What makes you think that?
Ronnie_Baker	712682920557748228	2016-03-23T16:50:23	mks_mvp Why would there be an all out war? All out war would result in eradication of Palestine in a week.
Ronnie_Baker	712682102420930560	2016-03-23T16:47:08	mks_mvp Eh? It's not binary. They can both be bad.
Ronnie_Baker	712681631694192641	2016-03-23T16:45:16	mks_mvp There's your peace talks ;-)
Ronnie_Baker	712681590673903617	2016-03-23T16:45:06	mks_mvp According to Peace Now, during peace talks Israel set a new record for settlement expansion at nearly 14k approved settler homes
Ronnie_Baker	712680971586314241	2016-03-23T16:42:39	mks_mvp Unfortunately it's also the problem of millions of Arabs throughout MENA as well.
Ronnie_Baker	712680730279555072	2016-03-23T16:41:41	mks_mvp Peace talks achieved what they were intended to - nothing. I support improved relations with Russia, but not at Russia's expense
Ronnie_Baker	712680347188613120	2016-03-23T16:40:10	mks_mvp This is growing a little tiresome. Got anything else to add or just want to continue pimping Clinton with non-existent facts?
Ronnie_Baker	712680133950189568	2016-03-23T16:39:19	Now we know.  
Ronnie_Baker	712679784317255680	2016-03-23T16:37:56	mks_mvp An unnecessary amount of her FP is exactly about war engagement. Hard power where soft power is more appropriate.
Ronnie_Baker	712679427616825344	2016-03-23T16:36:31	mks_mvp So her FP is excusable because she voted for gay rights? You're clutching at straws.
Ronnie_Baker	712679188189175809	2016-03-23T16:35:34	mks_mvp lol. That's a single 'act'. Not a 'Policy'. Think we;re running out of steam here buddy ;-)
Ronnie_Baker	712676986812928000	2016-03-23T16:26:49	mks_mvp Tell me about how Palestinians lives have improved as a consequence of those peace talks. I'm all ears.
Ronnie_Baker	712676223386652676	2016-03-23T16:23:47	mks_mvp There has been no progress....

Ronnie_Baker	712675979299127298	2016-03-23T16:22:49	mks_mvp Besides, Iran as a Nuclear nation really didn't worry me much.
Ronnie_Baker	712675575383523328	2016-03-23T16:21:12	mks_mvp Again, read the article. There is no table and Hilary just came out and told AIPAC that Israel has her full backing.
Ronnie_Baker	712675335276339205	2016-03-23T16:20:15	mks_mvp I'd give a lot more credit to Obama and Rouhani tbh. We'll see how Hilary treats Iran when she's President.
Ronnie_Baker	712675157756612608	2016-03-23T16:19:33	mks_mvp Read the article, much of it is there.
Ronnie_Baker	712674441411493888	2016-03-23T16:16:42	mks_mvp Yes, because she is advised by them and accepts their expansionist ideology..course they like her, that's exactly why it scares me!
Ronnie_Baker	712674170543284227	2016-03-23T16:15:37	Wat 
Ronnie_Baker	712674052054224896	2016-03-23T16:15:09	mks_mvp Read it and feel free to contest. It;s pretty factual as far as I can see.
Ronnie_Baker	712673104166686720	2016-03-23T16:11:23	mks_mvp Read the facts pal. You;re welcome. 
Ronnie_Baker	712672655439044609	2016-03-23T16:09:36	mks_mvp So as a super power it is their duty to perpetuate war?
Ronnie_Baker	712672438316703744	2016-03-23T16:08:44	mks_mvp No, i would not.
Ronnie_Baker	712672374852685824	2016-03-23T16:08:29	mks_mvp Define impressive. Laying waste to vast regions of MENA and gloating about it does not impress me.
Ronnie_Baker	712672052814045184	2016-03-23T16:07:12	mks_mvp She will. They all will. Hence the disillusionment....and rise of The Donald ;-)
Ronnie_Baker	712671704992972801	2016-03-23T16:05:49	mks_mvp My concern with Hilary is not what she says she'll do, it's what she actually will do. Her record to date scares me. Esp F/policy.
Ronnie_Baker	712670961321967616	2016-03-23T16:02:52	mks_mvp Collusion with big business, selling out to corporate interests. Overly aggressive foreign policy, neglect of the working class etc
Ronnie_Baker	712670760356065280	2016-03-23T16:02:04	mks_mvp Lawd. Not more of the same as trump, more of the same that has disillusioned the electorate over the last few decades.
Ronnie_Baker	712670587210993666	2016-03-23T16:01:23	mks_mvp None of them!! That's the point. that's why people begin to lean towards extremist views!! Do we have to keep doing this chief?
Ronnie_Baker	712670409334792192	2016-03-23T16:00:41	mks_mvp So she's offering to keep everything the same. How's that a solution?
Ronnie_Baker	712670235594129409	2016-03-23T15:59:59	mks_mvp Neither. Trump offers flaming unicorns, Hillary offers more of the same that people are fed up with.
Ronnie_Baker	712669635942883328	2016-03-23T15:57:36	mks_mvp Clinton is not 'real' with the people. Behave.
Ronnie_Baker	712669493000974337	2016-03-23T15:57:02	mks_mvp Politicians are also ignorant on real solutions. Often purposefully so. They don;t want change - why would they? Getting rich.
Ronnie_Baker	712669198200115201	2016-03-23T15:55:52	mks_mvp Trump adapted....and here we are.
Ronnie_Baker	712669148979994624	2016-03-23T15:55:40	mks_mvp It plays it's part, but that's the world we live in. Shouldn't politicians have to adapt?No use blaming something that won't change
Ronnie_Baker	712668771433877504	2016-03-23T15:54:10	mks_mvp Indeed you could argue, the political class prefer a disenfranchised electorate. A divided people are far easier to manage.
Ronnie_Baker	712667490753454081	2016-03-23T15:49:05	mks_mvp Yes you can. If the political class fails to mobilize the electorate, it is the political class's fault.
Ronnie_Baker	712666902678515715	2016-03-23T15:46:44	mks_mvp I have no interest in discussing Trump's populist statements. They are irrelevant to the discussion.
Ronnie_Baker	712666696272588800	2016-03-23T15:45:55	mks_mvp For the last time. His rise is due to a lack of alternatives - of real change. This is partly their fault - as article suggested
Ronnie_Baker	712666475555721218	2016-03-23T15:45:03	mks_mvp I'm not sure why you assume I agree with anything Trump says. I don't. That doesn't mean I have any faith in Clintons though.
Ronnie_Baker	712666226594435072	2016-03-23T15:44:03	mks_mvp That's a long convo. Deregulating the financial sector created jobs. The full scale of consequences are yet to unfold.
Ronnie_Baker	712665566813683712	2016-03-23T15:41:26	mks_mvp And past &amp; present politicians are accountable for that by virtue of offering no alternatives.

Ronnie_Baker	712665219248435200	2016-03-23T15:40:03	mks_mvp No. Jeb &amp; Hilary offer more of the same that has created US social and economic problems. That's not pragmatism.

Ronnie_Baker	712658943797952512	2016-03-23T15:15:07	mks_mvp Sure, in a choice between that and more of the same, what you going to choose if you lack the education to see it for what it is?

Ronnie_Baker	712657860899942400	2016-03-23T15:10:49	mks_mvp Errrm yes, you can blame politicians for the electorate becoming disillusioned with politicians. Who else should we blame? Muslims?
Ronnie_Baker	712657547996434433	2016-03-23T15:09:34	mks_mvp The entire US political class is to blame for Trump And the Clintons are a significant player in that class. Past, present &amp; future
Ronnie_Baker	712656894368686081	2016-03-23T15:06:58	mks_mvp This perpetuates disillusioned populace, hence extreme political options become more palatable. It's quite a basic premise tbh.

Ronnie_Baker	712654861309902850	2016-03-23T14:58:54	mks_mvp The Clintons offer more of the same..........to an already disillusioned populace. Trump offers change, no matter how outlandish
Ronnie_Baker	712654629520039936	2016-03-23T14:57:58	mks_mvp Trump already has celebrity. But it was your point, not mine. My point is lack of political choice results in extremism.

Ronnie_Baker	712653624489287681	2016-03-23T14:53:59	mks_mvp But look at electoral turnout in recent years in the US. Large parts of population have no interest in partaking in politics.
Ronnie_Baker	712653357161127937	2016-03-23T14:52:55	mks_mvp Certainly in part, celebrity culture dominates. Presidents &amp; Primeministers getting younger, better polished for TV etc.
Ronnie_Baker	712647489803804672	2016-03-23T14:29:36	mks_mvp I wouldn't lay the full blame at the Clinton's door, but they certainly are a big part of the problem at present. More of the same.

Ronnie_Baker	712634938340675585	2016-03-23T13:39:44	mks_mvp Perhaps, but it'll take a more eloquent refutation than that to demonstrate it.
