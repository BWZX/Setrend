ChrisGiles_	725721614944468992	2016-04-28T16:21:30	billwells_1 Gilesyb Yes - that is the model. But requires perfect competition assumption to get big net gains
ChrisGiles_	725718732467757056	2016-04-28T16:10:03	GeorgePeretzQC Yes and no. They are in the same pamphlet, but not specifically linked
ChrisGiles_	725718429353824256	2016-04-28T16:08:51	NauroCampos jdportes Still not entirely clear where the number comes from
ChrisGiles_	725715536156434432	2016-04-28T15:57:21	TonysAngle Yes- true. But to be fair, it is meant as a long run model (even though, bizarrely,  the only numbers mentioned are up to 2020)
ChrisGiles_	725715304077266945	2016-04-28T15:56:26	If you want to see how others modelled WTO with no import tariffs, see LSE here  and here 
ChrisGiles_	725714548414623744	2016-04-28T15:53:26	jdportes ... so you can't complain about consistency because if you do, the reply from individuals is "I don't really agree with that bit"
ChrisGiles_	725714392071979009	2016-04-28T15:52:48	jdportes True. But modelling is sort of part of the "econ for Brexit" campaign and also sort of disowned by it. Very confusing....
ChrisGiles_	725713842270003200	2016-04-28T15:50:37	nmistry108 Not really. Published paper doesn't explain it as I did, cause you've got to go and ask. But it is here 
ChrisGiles_	725713639244705792	2016-04-28T15:49:49	jdportes Yes - agree with all that. Don't think (but don't know) there is any free movement assumptions made. Not written down
ChrisGiles_	725713340434112512	2016-04-28T15:48:38	nmistry108 Not as applied today, I don't think. But it has a long history (this is 1984 version), so I am sure a write up exists somewhere
ChrisGiles_	725713135831781376	2016-04-28T15:47:49	johnlappin jdportes That might be the point. But at least we pretty much have the facts on what the model assumes

ChrisGiles_	725712447089348608	2016-04-28T15:45:05	jdportes But Patrick says, correctly,  that in his perfect competition model, regulation is very harmful  - it is *in that model, at least*
ChrisGiles_	725712139596484612	2016-04-28T15:43:51	jdportes Nothing specific. The regulation section mentions gender equality and working time as particularly egregious
ChrisGiles_	725711893399216128	2016-04-28T15:42:53	jdportes And, yes I am writing it up. It's taken a while to get to the bottom of what's going on
ChrisGiles_	725711778513035264	2016-04-28T15:42:25	Guy_Stallard Not sure - that's not the driver of the results. It's the common external tariff that does all the work
ChrisGiles_	725711479421452288	2016-04-28T15:41:14	jdportes Yes- coz we're out of tariff, you can do what you like on regs - it is a small assumption. Patrick normally assumes 6%
ChrisGiles_	725711279416074240	2016-04-28T15:40:26	...er, that's about it.

ChrisGiles_	725655978549628928	2016-04-28T12:00:41	RJohnDickinson That's what I thought. But no offsetting losses from being exposed to the EU customs union tariff?
ChrisGiles_	725654950852857857	2016-04-28T11:56:36	DrewEdgar_CB Yes - that's obvious. But on the ToT bit? And where is the trade off with tariff and NTB between UK and EU?

ChrisGiles_	705731081169969152	2016-03-04T12:26:16	DuncanWeldon Sorry. Here's a puppy 
ChrisGiles_	705729926847139840	2016-03-04T12:21:41	Why expect meddlesome Europeans to convert to rationality after Brexit vote? No reason says fromTGA

ChrisGiles_	705727669573443584	2016-03-04T12:12:42	notayesmansecon billwells_1 DuncanWeldon yes. Had power to ask ONS to analyse (eg - why is RPI so useless?) but not to impose change
ChrisGiles_	705726440025800704	2016-03-04T12:07:49	notayesmansecon billwells_1 DuncanWeldon Completely wrong. CPAC knew it was an advisory body. Gave advice that's all. Had no power
ChrisGiles_	705723507007692800	2016-03-04T11:56:10	billwells_1 notayesmansecon DuncanWeldon CPAC was the RPI advisory committee, but we were sacked when refused to rubber stamp RPI fudge
ChrisGiles_	705722127845040128	2016-03-04T11:50:41	billwells_1 notayesmansecon DuncanWeldon But RPI is horrid in lots of ways (don't get me started) mortgage interest just one of them

ChrisGiles_	705721580727484416	2016-03-04T11:48:31	becksv8 Yes - I am sure that played quite a part. Although it predates the big rise in N Sea output
ChrisGiles_	705721386099216385	2016-03-04T11:47:44	StrongerInNos Yes - though we need to see the real exchange rate as UK, unlike WG, had something of an inflation problem in the 70s

ChrisGiles_	705681262309208064	2016-03-04T09:08:18	notayesmansecon DuncanWeldon I disagree because we don't put asset prices in inflation measures. Don't do gold, nor equities either
ChrisGiles_	705680596996120576	2016-03-04T09:05:39	notayesmansecon DuncanWeldon better to use an inflation measure with some regard for owner occupied housing than none. (2/2)

ChrisGiles_	705457947565019137	2016-03-03T18:20:56	notayesmansecon But as DuncanWeldon rightly says, the RPI - Carli formula stuff was much the bigger issue. CPIH is used by almost no one
