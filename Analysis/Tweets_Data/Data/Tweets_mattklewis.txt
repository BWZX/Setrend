mattklewis	725387949395857408	2016-04-27T18:15:38	that's not right, Matt. Clarke Reed went for Ford because of it and that was the end of Reagan's bid 
mattklewis	725388079826145280	2016-04-27T18:16:09	Possibly. That's why people who want to get rid of him for good would rather "Lose with Cruz" now. 
mattklewis	725387797402652674	2016-04-27T18:15:02	Cruz is always comparing this election to 1980. Maybe he's more realistically hoping it's like 1976 for him

mattklewis	725385815224897536	2016-04-27T18:07:10	It's Rand and Christie mashed together.  Policy-wise, it's contradictory, paper-thin and incoherent at times. But politically it sells.

mattklewis	715275591105142784	2016-03-30T20:32:44	As is often the case with Trump, his statements tend to also mess up things for conservatives (who'll have to pick up the pieces).

mattklewis	715265047786864640	2016-03-30T19:50:51	2. Trump's comments upset the apple cart, presumably making pro-life policies less palatable &amp; less easily defended.
mattklewis	715264680156078080	2016-03-30T19:49:23	1. By not punishing the woman (&amp; by allowing for exceptions), pro-lifers seek to defend unborn life in the most politically palatable way.

mattklewis	715259203372322816	2016-03-30T19:27:37	As allahpundit once said, you could probably get Trump to endorse The Purge. “We have to do things, and they’re big things, believe me"
mattklewis	715259243868266496	2016-03-30T19:27:47	This piece seems rather appropriate to bring up at a moment like this. 
mattklewis	715259705422135296	2016-03-30T19:29:37	Aside from upsetting Pro-Life orthodoxy, Trump's statements obviously hand Hillary a yuge cudgel to expand the already growing gender gap.
mattklewis	715258963458174976	2016-03-30T19:26:40	At the risk of overstating it, I believe Trump's abortion comments today are a lightning bolt and turning point in this campaign.

mattklewis	715257959253741568	2016-03-30T19:22:40	Of course, like exceptions for rape, penalizing only the abortionist is a political compromise inconsistent w/ the notion abortion is murder
